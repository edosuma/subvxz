13:11.021 --> 13:13.994
JUST HOLD ON! I'M A DOCTOR!
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!

13:17.067 --> 13:19.799
OH, CRAP. CHARLIE!

13:19.799 --> 13:21.972
CHARLIE!

13:26.136 --> 13:28.138
(exhales deeply)
SWEETHEART, ARE YOU OKAY?

13:28.138 --> 13:30.440
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

13:30.440 --> 13:34.314
I DREAMT THERE WERE
NO MORE GOOD DAYS.

13:38.588 --> 13:41.091
(people shouting indistinctly)

13:41.091 --> 13:42.452
(beep)

13:42.452 --> 13:44.394
CAN'T GET MY FAMILY.

13:44.394 --> 13:45.996
THAT'S OUR S.U.V.

13:45.996 --> 13:48.828
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKIN'.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.231
(man) CAN'T YOU HEAR ME?!

13:51.231 --> 13:53.603
(man shouts indistinctly)
HEY, GO THIS WAY!

13:53.603 --> 13:58.038
GET UP AND MOVE IT AROUND!
(woman sobbing)

13:59.839 --> 14:01.371
HANDS UP!

14:01.371 --> 14:03.373
HANDS UP!

14:03.373 --> 14:05.415
I GOT HER.

14:05.415 --> 14:07.847
GET OUT. COME ON.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.850
GET OUT. GET OUT! WE KNOW
YOU WERE PLANNING AN ATTACK.
(woman groans)

14:10.850 --> 14:13.383
WHAT DID YOU DO, HUH?
(groans) UHH!

14:13.383 --> 14:16.186
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED!
TAKE IT EASY.

14:16.186 --> 14:21.491
WE KNOW ABOUT THE SUITCASE.
DID YOU SET IT OFF? ANSWER ME!
(panting) I BLACKED OUT.
I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

14:21.491 --> 14:27.237
THERE WAS A STORM.
THE HORSES WERE SCARED.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:27.237 --> 14:31.001
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING--
CALM DOWN! DOES THIS LOOK LIKE
A DIRTY BOMB TO YOU?

14:31.001 --> 14:34.004
DOES IT?
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS IS.

14:34.004 --> 14:36.146
MAYBE THEY WEREN'T
EVEN INVOLVED.
ARE--ARE YOU GUYS COPS?

14:36.146 --> 14:37.347
(Mark) FBI. IT'S OKAY.
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:37.347 --> 14:39.349
(woman) WAS IT A NUCLEAR ATTACK?
I DON'T KNOW.

14:39.349 --> 14:42.082
IT'S GOTTA BE THE BIG ONE.
I MEAN, LOOK. LOOK AT THIS MESS.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.384
IT'S GOTTA BE.
WHEN'S HELP GETTING HERE?

14:44.384 --> 14:45.986
LOOK, UNTIL
EMERGENCY SERVICES ARRIVE,

14:46.316 --> 14:50.020
WE NEED TO STAY CALM AND HELP
WHOEVER WE CAN, ALL RIGHT?
THEY AIN'T COMIN'.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.621
WHAT?
(Demetri) WHAT'D YOU SAY?

14:51.621 --> 14:54.494
I JUST HEARD ON MY RADIO,
SOME GUY IN SAN DIEGO.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.496
THEY'RE DEALING
WITH THE SAME THING.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.029
IT'S MORE THAN JUST L.A.,
MAN.

14:59.029 --> 15:01.531
SIT DOWN. YOU MOVE, I SHOOT.

15:01.531 --> 15:05.275
(man shouting indistinctly)

15:05.275 --> 15:06.276
(beeping)

15:06.276 --> 15:09.039
I CAN'T GET THROUGH TO ZOEY.
WHAT ABOUT OLIVIA?

15:09.039 --> 15:11.441
NO.
LISTEN, ZOEY'S IN SEATTLE
RIGHT NOW.

15:11.441 --> 15:13.183
BUT OLIVIA'S CLOSE BY,
RIGHT?

15:13.183 --> 15:15.185
HOSPITAL'S 2 MILES.
YOU CAN MAKE IT ON FOOT.

15:15.185 --> 15:17.417
YEAH. NO, NO,
I-I-I CAN'T JUST LEAVE--

15:17.417 --> 15:20.090
LISTEN, THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO HERE RIGHT NOW.

15:20.090 --> 15:22.052
OKAY? GO CHECK
ON YOUR FAMILY. GO!

15:22.052 --> 15:25.055
(sirens continue wailing)

15:32.332 --> 15:35.335
(man shouting indistinctly)

15:48.118 --> 15:51.351
(electricity crackles)

15:51.351 --> 15:53.123
(woman screams)

15:53.123 --> 15:55.085
HELP ME!

15:55.085 --> 15:58.058
(alarm bell ringing)

15:58.058 --> 16:01.091
(people shouting indistinctly)
(man) LOOK OUT!

16:01.091 --> 16:04.094
MOVE! AAH!

16:04.094 --> 16:06.636
(tires screech)
WATCH OUT! LOOK OUT, MAN!

16:06.636 --> 16:10.070
HEY! SON OF A...

16:10.070 --> 16:12.372
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

16:12.372 --> 16:15.375
(helicopters whirring overhead)

16:15.375 --> 16:18.378
(siren wailing)

16:27.117 --> 16:29.219
(man) Roger.

16:46.676 --> 16:51.611
(man on TV
speaking indistinctly)

16:51.611 --> 16:55.045
(woman) THERE ARE
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS

16:55.045 --> 16:57.687
OF INJURED PEOPLE
WAITING FOR EMERGENCY...

16:57.687 --> 17:00.090
(woman, British accent)
UH, ALL WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN

17:00.090 --> 17:02.492
IS THAT EVERYONE ON THE PLANET

17:02.492 --> 17:06.556
SEEMED TO HAVE BLACKED OUT
AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME.
(man) ...CONFIRMING THAT

17:06.556 --> 17:09.659
THE BLACKOUT WAS A WORLDWIDE
PHENOMENON. OFFICIALS ARE...

17:09.659 --> 17:12.562
(woman) ...IS UNKNOWN. FIRE
SERVICES AND POLICE SERVICES

17:12.562 --> 17:15.635
ARE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED
AT THIS TIME.
(man) ...EN ESTE MOMENTO.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.568
MY GOD.
IT'S THE WHOLE WORLD.

17:18.568 --> 17:22.342
(woman) ...INFORMATION AS TO
THE CAUSE OF THE BLACKOUT.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.083
(woman) HOSPITALS ARE
OVERFLOWING. FIRE SERVICES...
(cell phone ringing)

17:33.083 --> 17:35.325
AND POLICE SERVICES
ARE COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED...
LIVY! LIVY, I'M HERE.

17:35.325 --> 17:38.658
OH, THANK GOD
I GOT AHOLD OF YOU.
WHAT ABOUT CHARLIE?
IS SHE OKAY?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.560
SHE'S FINE. NICOLE CALLED.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.333
SHE CAN STAY PUT
TILL ONE OF US GETS HOME.
AND YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

17:43.333 --> 17:45.395
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:45.395 --> 17:48.398
WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF SURGERY
AND WE ALL LOST CONSCIOUSNESS.

17:48.398 --> 17:51.070
EVERYONE. PATIENT DIED
WHILE WE WERE OUT.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.072
I'M DOWNTOWN RIGHT NOW.
SAME THING.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.575
SO, UH, W-WHAT?
EVERYONE THERE BLACKED OUT?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.577
YEAH, EVERYONE. WE THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST THE HOSPITAL,

17:57.577 --> 17:59.579
BUT THEN CORRIE GOT A CALL
FROM HER MOTHER IN CHICAGO.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.383
SAME THING HAPPENED THERE.
I KNOW. IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS THING IS GLOBAL.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.084
GLOBAL? THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

18:05.084 --> 18:08.118
OH, I-I LOVE YOU,
BUT, BABE, I GOTTA GO.
(beep)

18:08.118 --> 18:10.620
ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.
LIVY?
(siren wailing)

18:10.620 --> 18:13.223
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
GOT AN 8-YEAR-OLD BOY.
PEDE VERSUS CAR,

18:13.223 --> 18:15.225
PLOWED STRAIGHT THROUGH
A FENCE AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

18:15.225 --> 18:17.867
HEAD INJURY ON THE RIGHT,
ABDOMINAL BRUISING ON THE LEFT.

18:17.867 --> 18:21.601
DR. BENFORD!
BRYCE, WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU
BEEN? GO GET INTO YOUR SCRUBS.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.673
MEET ME IN E.R.
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM INTO TRAUMA.

18:23.673 --> 18:26.506
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY,
HONEY.
I KNOW, OLIVIA.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.508
HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?

18:28.508 --> 18:30.340
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:30.340 --> 18:32.382
WHAT HAVE WE HEARD
FROM WASHINGTON?

18:32.382 --> 18:35.245
WE'RE THE SAME.
EVERYONE'S JUST GATHERING INTEL.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.487
CIA, HOMELAND SECURITY. OUR
VARIOUS LEGATS OFFICES OVERSEAS.

18:37.487 --> 18:40.220
IN OTHER WORDS,
NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING.
HOW'S HE DOING?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.222
(Bryce) HE'S TAKING A TURN
FOR THE WORSE.
(monitor beeping steadily)

18:42.222 --> 18:44.394
(boy coughing and gasping)
I GOT NO BREATH SOUNDS
ON THE LEFT,

18:44.394 --> 18:46.896
POSSIBLE PUNCTURED LUNG.
HE NEEDS A LEFT CHEST TUBE STAT.

18:46.896 --> 18:49.599
(monitor beeping rapidly)
WE DON'T RELEASE
THE PRESSURE SOON, IT'S GONNA

18:49.599 --> 18:52.532
STOP HIS HEART FROM BEATING.
HE'S GOING SOUTH.
SATs ARE DROPPING.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.534
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WORLDWIDE PHENOMENON.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.636
NEAR AS WE CAN TELL.
PEOPLE FROM ALL CORNERS
LOSING CONSCIOUSNESS

18:56.636 --> 19:00.410
AT EXACTLY THE SAME MOMENT.
AND FOR THE SAME DURATION--
2 MINUTES, 17 SECONDS.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.872
(Mark) HOW IS THAT
EVEN POSSIBLE?

19:02.872 --> 19:05.575
WHERE THE HELL IS THAT
CHEST TUBE TRAY? I NEED IT NOW.

19:05.575 --> 19:09.148
(Bryce) WE GOT NO PULSE.
BLOOD PRESSURE'S 40.
THORACOTOMY.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.351
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
(Olivia) COME ON, SWEETIE.
HANG IN THERE.

19:11.351 --> 19:12.622
PULSE OX 90. PULSE OX 80.
ALL RIGHT.

19:12.622 --> 19:16.286
WE'RE DROPPING!
WE'RE LOSING HIM! NO PULSE.
HOW ARE WE DOING?

19:16.286 --> 19:17.657
NO PULSE.
BLOOD PRESSURE'S DROPPING.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.159
SO WE'VE ELIMINATED
NUCLEAR LAUNCHES,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.532
E.M.P.s. AND CHEMICAL AGENTS.
WHAT ABOUT
NATURAL PHENOMENA THEN?

19:22.532 --> 19:24.534
NASA'S CHECKING INTO
MORE EXOTIC EXPLANATIONS--

19:24.534 --> 19:26.936
SOLAR FLARES, GAMMA BURSTS,
THAT KIND OF THING.

19:26.936 --> 19:28.938
BUT SO FAR
THEY'VE COME UP EMPTY.

19:28.938 --> 19:31.941
WHAT ABOUT THE VATICAN?
HAS THE POPE CHIMED IN YET?

19:31.941 --> 19:34.604
(monitor beeping rapidly)
(Olivia)
LET'S GET THIS CHEST TUBE IN.

19:34.604 --> 19:37.176
SATs IMPROVING,
B.P.'s NORMALIZING.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.548
(monitor beeping steadily)
(woman) PLEUROVAC.

19:38.548 --> 19:40.610
(chest tube sucking)

19:40.610 --> 19:43.313
DOING GREAT, BUDDY.
DOING REAL GOOD.

19:43.313 --> 19:46.216
OKAY, LET'S GET HIM
INTO THE C.T. SCANNER,

19:46.216 --> 19:48.218
CHECK OUT THAT HEAD INJURY.
BRYCE, YOU CLOSE HIM UP.

19:48.218 --> 19:50.220
NICE JOB. BUT DON'T THINK
YOU'RE OFF THE HOOK.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.292
I STILL WANNA KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE YESTERDAY.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.424
(monitor continues
beeping steadily)

19:54.424 --> 19:56.426
(woman)
YEAH, CLEAN THAT UP.

19:56.426 --> 19:58.428
WE NEED TO WRAP OUR HEADS

19:58.428 --> 20:00.570
AROUND THE SCOPE
OF THIS THING, PEOPLE.

20:00.570 --> 20:02.672
IT'S NOW BEEN FOUR HOURS
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

20:02.672 --> 20:06.336
YOU SHUT OFF THE CONSCIOUSNESS
OF THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE

20:06.336 --> 20:08.338
FOR TWO MINUTES.

20:08.338 --> 20:10.610
WHAT WOULD THE DEATH TOLL BE?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.342
HOW MANY CARS COLLIDED?

20:12.342 --> 20:14.344
WE HAVE PLANES DOWN AT L.A.X.

20:14.344 --> 20:17.347
HOW MANY MORE ACROSS
THE COUNTRY? AROUND THE WORLD?

20:17.347 --> 20:19.349
(man) F.A.A.'s REPORTING
877 AIRCRAFT DOWN

20:19.349 --> 20:21.921
IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.924
AIR FORCE TWO WAS ONE OF 'EM.
THE VEEP WAS ON BOARD.

20:24.924 --> 20:26.326
OKAY.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.697
WHAT ABOUT HOSPITALS?

20:27.697 --> 20:28.898
OPERATIONS?

20:28.898 --> 20:30.900
BIRTHS THAT WERE IN PROCESS.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.904
PEOPLE PROBABLY DIED
WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.
(indistinct whispering)

20:34.904 --> 20:37.607
(man) GLOBAL PROJECTIONS
ARE PRETTY STAGGERING.

20:37.607 --> 20:40.310
WHAT ABOUT
THE BLACKOUTS THEMSELVES, SIR?

20:40.310 --> 20:42.372
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

20:42.372 --> 20:45.945
WELL, WE'VE BEEN SAYING
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN BLACKING OUT,

20:45.945 --> 20:48.548
BUT...

20:48.548 --> 20:50.920
THAT WASN'T MY EXPERIENCE.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.523
FOR ME, IT WAS...

20:53.523 --> 20:57.457
MORE LIKE A DREAM,
ONLY MORE VIVID THAN THAT.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.689
ONE SECOND, I WAS IN A CAR.

20:59.689 --> 21:02.662
THE NEXT...

21:02.662 --> 21:04.934
I WAS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

21:04.934 --> 21:06.966
YEAH, THE SAME THING
HAPPENED TO ME.
ME, TOO.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.398
DURING THE BLACKOUT,

21:08.398 --> 21:11.641
PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE EXPERIENCED
SOME KIND OF... HALLUCINATION.

21:11.641 --> 21:13.373
NO. NO, NO.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.946
EXCEPT THAT MINE DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE A HALLUCINATION.

21:16.946 --> 21:19.949
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, BENFORD?
I DIDN'T JUST LOSE
CONSCIOUSNESS.

21:19.949 --> 21:21.951
IT FELT MORE LIKE MY...

21:21.951 --> 21:23.383
CONSCIOUSNESS WENT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.715
LIKE I WAS HAVING A MEMORY,

21:25.715 --> 21:30.320
ONLY IT--IT WASN'T OF THE PAST.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.322
IT WAS OF THE FUTURE.

21:34.324 --> 21:36.326
I WAS IN MY OFFICE.

21:36.326 --> 21:38.368
IT WAS NIGHT.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.370
IT WAS 10:00 ON THE HOUR.

21:40.370 --> 21:42.372
I WAS LOOKING OUT
INTO THE ATRIUM,

21:42.372 --> 21:44.604
AND I HAPPENED TO SEE
THE DATE--

21:44.604 --> 21:48.408
APRIL 29, 2010,

21:48.408 --> 21:50.540
ABOUT HALF A YEAR FROM NOW.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.982
HOLD ON. APRIL 29th?

21:52.982 --> 21:55.985
I SAW THE SAME DATE.
IT WAS ON THE NEWS.

21:55.985 --> 21:58.448
SAME FOR ME--
APRIL 29th, 10:00 P.M.

21:58.448 --> 22:00.550
SO YOU'RE SAYING WHAT,

22:00.550 --> 22:03.322
EVERYONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS
JUST JUMPED FORWARD SIX MONTHS

22:03.322 --> 22:07.497
TO APRIL 29th?

22:07.497 --> 22:09.899
CRAZY AS THAT SOUNDS, YEAH.

22:19.609 --> 22:22.612
(indistinct conversations)

22:24.574 --> 22:26.716
SIT DOWN.

22:26.716 --> 22:27.977
SIT DOWN.

22:29.579 --> 22:31.721
J.T., COULD YOU, UH,
GIVE ME A HAND? THANKS.

22:31.721 --> 22:34.654
WE DIDN'T DO THIS.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.386
EVEN IF YOU DIDN'T,

22:36.386 --> 22:38.928
YOU WERE STILL PLANNING
ON KILLING THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

22:38.928 --> 22:41.030
SO STAY STILL AND SHUT UP.

22:42.962 --> 22:43.933
HEY.
HEY.

22:43.933 --> 22:46.365
YOU GET AHOLD OF ZOEY?
YEAH, SHE'S ALL RIGHT.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.137
MARK, HEY. YOU GOT A SEC?
SURE.

22:48.137 --> 22:50.139
I THINK THERE MAY BE A WAY
TO CORROBORATE

22:50.139 --> 22:52.141
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT
IN THERE.

22:52.141 --> 22:54.103
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

22:54.103 --> 22:56.105
WELL, IN MY... FLASH-FORWARD,

22:56.105 --> 22:58.708
IT WAS APRIL 30th, 6:00 A.M.,
BUT I WAS IN LONDON,

22:58.708 --> 23:01.380
WHICH IS EIGHT HOURS AHEAD
OF THE WEST COAST,

23:01.380 --> 23:04.383
SO IT MAKES SENSE.
WAIT, "FLASH-FORWARD"?
WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

23:04.383 --> 23:06.656
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAW.

23:06.656 --> 23:09.058
I WAS HAVING A MEETING WITH OUR
LIAISON AT NEW SCOTLAND YARD.
(speaks indistinctly)

23:09.058 --> 23:11.921
I REMEMBER
WE WERE INTERRUPTED BECAUSE...

23:11.921 --> 23:14.524
THIS BIRD JUST CRASHED
INTO THE WINDOW.
(thud)

23:14.524 --> 23:16.125
THE POINT IS,

23:16.125 --> 23:18.397
I HAD A VISION OF FIONA BANKS.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.930
LET'S SEE
IF SHE HAD A VISION OF ME.

23:20.930 --> 23:23.402
(British accent)
INSPECTOR BANKS.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.404
FIONA,
THIS IS AL GOUGH, FBI.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.406
I'M HERE WITH MY COLLEAGUES
IN L.A.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.578
MY GOD.

23:28.578 --> 23:31.941
UH, I KNOW WHY YOU'RE CALLING.
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT I SAW.

23:31.941 --> 23:33.543
WE ALL DO.

23:33.543 --> 23:36.546
Okay. Um...
we were sitting in my office.

23:36.546 --> 23:38.548
WHAT WAS THE DATE?
April 30th.

23:38.548 --> 23:39.749
WHAT TIME?

23:39.749 --> 23:42.051
UH, I DON'T KNOW.
UH, 6:00 IN THE MORNING.

23:42.051 --> 23:44.754
Don't ask me why
it was so early.

23:44.754 --> 23:46.726
Something to do
with the Rutherford case.

23:46.726 --> 23:50.159
YES! YES, AND--AND SOMETHING
INTERRUPTED US.
Yes. Uh, uh, a bird.

23:50.159 --> 23:53.032
IT FLEW AT THE WINDOW.
IT BROKE ITS NECK.

23:53.032 --> 23:56.966
SO OUR VISIONS
WERE THE SAME.

23:56.966 --> 23:59.939
WHEN THE WORLDWIDE BLACKOUT
OCCURRED EARLIER TODAY,

23:59.939 --> 24:02.071
PEOPLE WERE UNDERGOING
BRAIN SCANS

24:02.071 --> 24:05.144
AT THAT EXACT MOMENT.
(man) SO LIKE M.R.I.s OR P.E.T.
SCANS? THAT KIND OF THING?

24:05.144 --> 24:08.117
EXACTLY.
AND IN EACH OF THESE CASES,

24:08.117 --> 24:09.749
THE HIPPOCAMPUS--

24:09.749 --> 24:12.552
THAT'S THE MEMORY CENTER OF
THE BRAIN--WAS ACTIVELY ENGAGED

24:12.552 --> 24:14.554
FOR THE ENTIRE
2 MINUTES AND 17 SECONDS.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.085
THESE THOUGHT PATTERNS
ARE CONSISTENT

24:16.085 --> 24:17.687
WITH A WAKING EXPERIENCE.

24:17.687 --> 24:20.459
PEOPLE WERE NOT ASLEEP.
THEY WERE NOT DREAMING.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.992
SO THEN WHAT IS IT
THAT THEY WERE EXPERIENCING?

24:22.992 --> 24:25.034
(crying softly)
WELL, BY ALL APPEARANCES,

24:25.034 --> 24:28.137
UH, MEMORIES OF EVENTS
THAT HAVEN'T OCCURRED YET.
SO EVERYONE SAW THE FUTURE.

24:28.137 --> 24:30.570
BUT DID THEY SEE
THE SAME FUTURE?

24:30.570 --> 24:32.572
I MEAN, ARE THESE ACCOUNTS
CONSISTENT?

24:32.572 --> 24:35.144
WELL, THEY CERTAINLY
SEEM TO BE.

24:35.144 --> 24:37.707
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE
WERE WATCHING NEWS BROADCASTS,

24:37.707 --> 24:40.149
READING NEWSPAPERS, AND THEIR
DETAILS SEEM TO BE THE SAME--

24:40.149 --> 24:42.211
SENATOR GLENWAY
WILL BE FACING ETHICS CHARGES.

24:42.211 --> 24:44.614
(beeping)
THE DOW
WILL BE ON AN UPSWING.

24:44.614 --> 24:47.757
THERE'LL BE FOOD RIOTS IN
GHANA, AND THE LIST GOES ON.
(cell phone vibrating)

24:47.757 --> 24:50.720
A REMARKABLY CONCISE
SERIES OF EVENTS

24:50.720 --> 24:52.491
ARE STARTING TO
COME TOGETHER FROM THAT DAY.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.624
IT'S LIKE A GRAND MOSAIC
IS BEING FILLED IN.

24:54.624 --> 24:56.025
EVERYONE ON EARTH...

24:56.025 --> 24:59.769
MOSAIC. THAT WAS THE NAME
OF THE INVESTIGATION

24:59.769 --> 25:01.771
I WAS WORKING ON
IN MY VISION.

25:01.771 --> 25:04.734
IT HAD TO DO WITH
WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS.

25:04.734 --> 25:07.006
SO DID YOU SEE ANYTHING
IN YOUR VISION THAT WAS HELPFUL?

25:07.006 --> 25:09.779
PHOTOGRAPHS, NAMES,
PEOPLE OF INTEREST.

25:09.779 --> 25:12.511
IF THIS REALLY WAS
THE FUTURE WE ALL SAW,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.513
THEN I GUESS
MAYBE THEY WILL BE LEADS,

25:14.513 --> 25:18.047
BUT NONE OF THEM
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME RIGHT NOW.
ANYTHING ELSE?

25:18.047 --> 25:20.790
NO. NO, THAT--THAT WAS IT.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

25:20.790 --> 25:23.522
NOTHING. I, UH, I BLACKED OUT
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE

25:23.522 --> 25:26.025
AND WOKE UP ON THE ROAD.

25:26.025 --> 25:29.198
WHAT ABOUT OUR, UH,
PERSON OF INTEREST?

25:29.198 --> 25:32.201
DO WE THINK SHE'S INVOLVED?
(Mark) SHE'S A DEAD END,
IF YOU ASK ME,

25:32.201 --> 25:35.204
AND CLUELESS
AS THE REST OF US.
(Wedeck)
WELL, CIRCLE BACK ON IT ANYWAY.

25:35.204 --> 25:37.206
WE'RE GRASPING AT STRAWS
AT THIS POINT.

25:37.206 --> 25:39.268
JANIS, YOU WANNA SHARE
WHAT YOU SAW?

25:39.268 --> 25:41.010
YEAH, I WAS... (chuckles)

25:41.010 --> 25:42.972
GETTING A PRENATAL SONOGRAM.

25:42.972 --> 25:45.975
THE BABY WAS ABOUT 17 WEEKS,

25:45.975 --> 25:48.047
AND IT WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

25:48.047 --> 25:51.220
IT WAS TOTALLY BIZARRE.

25:51.220 --> 25:55.154
BUT I'M OBVIOUSLY
NOT PREGNANT.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.987
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
A BOYFRIEND.

25:57.987 --> 25:59.959
WHAT ABOUT YOU, SIR?

25:59.959 --> 26:02.191
I... WAS IN A MEETING.

26:02.191 --> 26:03.963
A MEETING...

26:03.963 --> 26:06.696
(whistling)

26:06.696 --> 26:08.968
AND I HAPPENED TO
GLANCE DOWN AT THE PAPER.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.199
SPORTS PAGE.

26:10.199 --> 26:12.201
THE RAYS RALLIED
FROM 3 RUNS DOWN

26:12.201 --> 26:14.203
TO SWEEP THE SOX AT FENWAY.

26:14.203 --> 26:15.605
AND THERE WAS ANOTHER STORY.

26:15.605 --> 26:19.779
KOBE BRYANT TORE HIS LIGAMENT
IN HIS KNEE. OUT FOR THE SEASON.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.711
(toilet flushes)

26:21.711 --> 26:24.353
YOU KNOW WHAT? WE SHOULD START
WRITING THESE STORIES DOWN.
(Janis) YEAH.

26:24.353 --> 26:26.355
I MEAN, THE "POST" HAS
A CIRCULATION OF WHAT,

26:26.355 --> 26:27.987
A MILLION?
A MILLION, YEAH.

26:27.987 --> 26:30.990
HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE
WERE READING IT THEN, TOO?

26:30.990 --> 26:34.593
WE GOTTA START
COMPARING STORIES.
YEAH, IT'S NOT JUST THE "POST."
IT'S ALL THE OTHER NEWS OUTLETS.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.366
7 BILLION PEOPLE
CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE.

26:37.366 --> 26:41.671
MAYBE JUST ONE OF THEM
KNOWS WHY THIS HAPPENED.
HOW DO WE COMPARE
7 BILLION STORIES?

26:41.671 --> 26:43.673
YOU CREATE A WEB SITE.
(Mark) RIGHT.

26:43.673 --> 26:46.005
PEOPLE CAN LOG ON
AND POST WHAT THEY SAW

26:46.005 --> 26:48.107
AND CROSS-REFERENCE
THEIR VISIONS.

26:48.107 --> 26:51.110
WE CAN PIGGYBACK ON THAT
AND SEARCH FOR PATTERNS.
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
I WAS ALREADY DOING.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.982
(Wedeck) WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MOSAIC.

26:52.982 --> 26:55.014
ALL THOSE LEADS
I WAS RUNNING DOWN.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.387
WE SHOULD START
FOLLOWING UP ON 'EM NOW.
ASSUMING YOUR VISION
IS EVEN ACCURATE,

26:58.387 --> 27:02.021
THIS INVESTIGATION
DOESN'T EXIST YET.
BUT IT COULD. IT WILL.
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

27:02.021 --> 27:04.023
I WAS INVESTIGATING
WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS.

27:04.023 --> 27:06.295
I SEEMED TO HAVE AN IDEA
WHY ALL OF THIS WAS HAPPENING.

27:06.295 --> 27:08.297
AND THOSE PEOPLE,
THE PLACES I SAW ON THE BOARD--

27:08.297 --> 27:11.300
THEY WERE PART OF THIS PUZZLE--
MOSAIC. LOOK, I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

27:11.300 --> 27:14.764
FINE. WE'LL SET UP
AN INTERAGENCY TASK FORCE.

27:14.764 --> 27:17.206
AND AS FAR AS THIS OFFICE
IS CONCERNED,

27:17.206 --> 27:19.308
YOU THREE, YOU OWN THIS.
THIS IS KIND OF INSANE.

27:19.308 --> 27:21.711
I MEAN, WE'RE RUNNING POINT
ON THIS

27:21.711 --> 27:25.174
BECAUSE HE HAD A VISION
OF US RUNNING POINT ON THIS?
(Mark) WHAT, YOU--
YOU FIND THAT FUNNY?

27:25.174 --> 27:29.148
(Mark) WE DON'T EVEN KNOW--
WE DON'T KNOW IF--
(Demetri) COME ON. WE DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING RIGHT NOW.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.650
IT WORKS--IT WORKS FOR ME!
IT WORKS FOR ME!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.783
THE WHOLE WORLD'S
ON PINS AND NEEDLES, PEOPLE.

27:33.783 --> 27:34.954
AIR TRAFFIC'S BEEN GROUNDED.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.286
PEOPLE SCARED TO LEAVE THEIR
HOMES, WALK ACROSS THE STREET.

27:37.286 --> 27:39.328
HELL, WE'VE GOT MARTIAL LAW
ACROSS HALF THIS COUNTRY.

27:39.328 --> 27:41.991
PRIORITY NUMBER ONE--
FINDING OUT WHAT CAUSED THIS.

27:41.991 --> 27:44.994
PRIORITY NUMBER TWO IS
FIGURING OUT WHETHER OR NOT

27:44.994 --> 27:47.136
IT'LL HAPPEN AGAIN.
YOU GOT IT?

27:47.136 --> 27:50.069
(Mark, Demetri and Janis)
YES, SIR.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.071
GOOD.

27:52.071 --> 27:53.302
I'M OUT.

27:57.146 --> 27:59.448
OKAY, MY PSYCHIC FRIEND,

27:59.448 --> 28:01.811
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

28:01.811 --> 28:03.412
I REMEMBER A NAME--
D. GIBBONS.

28:03.412 --> 28:05.684
GIBBONS.
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:05.684 --> 28:08.687
YEAH. WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

28:08.687 --> 28:11.160
THERE WAS A PHOTOGRAPH HERE
OF A DOLL.

28:11.160 --> 28:13.392
THE DOLL WAS BURNED.
THE HEAD WAS MELTED.

28:13.392 --> 28:16.125
THERE WAS A-A BULLET CASING
NEARBY.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.227
SOMETHING ABOUT BALTIMORE.

28:18.227 --> 28:19.969
A HAND.

28:19.969 --> 28:23.702
BALTIMORE... NO. NO, NO, WAIT.
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.774
A... A "BLUE HAND."

28:24.774 --> 28:28.007
THAT'S WHAT IT SAID.
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

28:28.007 --> 28:31.010
I HAVE NO IDEA.
JUST PUT IT UP.

28:31.010 --> 28:34.784
NO, NO, NO. WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
HERE, IN THE CENTER.

28:34.784 --> 28:36.816
THIS IS GONNA SOUND STUPID,

28:36.816 --> 28:38.818
BUT I WAS WEARING
ONE OF THOSE, UH...

28:38.818 --> 28:40.389
FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS.

28:40.389 --> 28:42.351
YOU KNOW, LIKE KIDS MAKE.
YEAH.

28:42.351 --> 28:46.255
OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. WHAT ELSE?
WHAT ELSE?
THAT'S IT.

28:46.255 --> 28:49.999
THOSE ARE ALL THE LEADS
I CAN REMEMBER.

28:49.999 --> 28:53.132
WHAT ABOUT YOUR STATE OF MIND?
WHAT WERE YOU DOING?

28:53.132 --> 28:56.035
(sighs)

28:56.035 --> 28:57.807
I WAS...

28:57.807 --> 28:59.338
CHAMBERING A ROUND.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.340
I WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

29:01.340 --> 29:04.043
YOU WERE SCARED TO DEATH
IN HERE?

29:04.043 --> 29:04.874
YEAH.

29:04.874 --> 29:07.476
THE OFFICE WAS EMPTY,
BUT...

29:07.476 --> 29:11.080
SOMEONE WAS COMING FOR ME.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.751
THEY WERE WEARING MASKS.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.154
THEY WANTED TO KILL ME
BECAUSE OF WHAT I KNEW.

29:15.154 --> 29:18.057
ONE OF 'EM HAD A...

29:18.057 --> 29:20.029
TATTOO.

29:24.393 --> 29:27.166
HOW MANY D. GIBBONS DO YOU THINK
THERE ARE IN THE WORLD?
MAYBE THOUSANDS.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.438
HAVE JANIS COMPILE A LIST.

29:29.438 --> 29:31.300
(sighs)

29:31.300 --> 29:34.143
NOT A HELL OF A LOT
TO GO ON YET.

29:34.143 --> 29:35.774
AT LEAST YOU REMEMBER
SOMETHING.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.307
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:40.179 --> 29:41.780
EVERYBODY SAW SOMETHING.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.782
EVERYBODY HAD
SOME KIND OF A VISION.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.784
I DIDN'T SEE
A DAMN THING, MARK.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.058
MAYBE IT MEANS YOU'LL
BE SLEEPING SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.

29:49.058 --> 29:51.020
IF I WAS SLEEPING,
WHY WASN'T I DREAMING?

29:51.020 --> 29:54.023
LOOK, I NEVER REMEMBER
MY DREAMS.

29:54.023 --> 29:56.996
STOP, ALL RIGHT?

29:56.996 --> 29:58.998
WE'RE BOTH THINKING
THE SAME THING,

29:58.998 --> 30:01.000
SO LET'S JUST SAY IT.

30:06.805 --> 30:08.807
WHAT IF I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING

30:08.807 --> 30:11.110
BECAUSE SIX MONTHS
FROM NOW...

30:11.110 --> 30:13.212
I'M GONNA BE DEAD?

30:20.089 --> 30:22.221
(crickets chirping)
MR. BENFORD?

30:22.221 --> 30:24.353
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

30:26.125 --> 30:28.457
YEAH. HOW'S CHARLIE?

30:28.457 --> 30:29.598
SHE'S FINE.

30:29.598 --> 30:31.961
SHE'S SLEEPING.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.066
I WAS WATCHING THE NEWS
ALL DAY.

30:37.066 --> 30:39.068
THEY SAY IT HAPPENED
EVERYWHERE.

30:39.068 --> 30:41.310
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

30:41.310 --> 30:43.312
IS THAT WHAT THEY'RE SAYING
AT THE FBI?

30:43.312 --> 30:45.244
DO YOU HAVE
INSIDE INFORMATION?

30:45.244 --> 30:47.616
I WISH WE DID.

30:47.616 --> 30:51.350
SO THEN YOU DON'T KNOW
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.153
I THINK GOD DID THIS.

30:56.085 --> 30:58.087
WHY?

30:58.087 --> 31:00.589
TO PUNISH US.

31:03.532 --> 31:05.634
(Olivia) STILL NO LUCK
FINDING HIS PARENTS?

31:05.634 --> 31:08.397
WELL, HIS MOTHER DIED
ON THE 405.

31:08.397 --> 31:11.640
FATHER'S NAME IS LLOYD SIMCOE.
HE WORKS AT STANFORD.

31:11.640 --> 31:16.005
BUT, UH, NO ONE'S BEEN
ABLE TO LOCATE HIM YET.
(whispers) YEAH.

31:16.005 --> 31:18.147
(normal voice) SO EVEN
IF THE KID PULLS THROUGH,

31:18.147 --> 31:20.649
HE COULD STILL WIND UP
AN ORPHAN.
HEY, YOU SAVED HIS LIFE TODAY.

31:20.649 --> 31:22.651
YOU CHALK THAT UP
AS A VICTORY.

31:22.651 --> 31:25.554
YEAH, I'M TRYING,
BUT AFTER A DAY LIKE TODAY...

31:25.554 --> 31:27.286
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

31:27.286 --> 31:29.418
HOW ARE YOU STAYING SO ZEN
THROUGH ALL THIS?

31:29.418 --> 31:32.091
WHO SAYS I AM?

31:35.524 --> 31:38.127
YOU WANNA KNOW WHY
I WASN'T AT WORK YESTERDAY?

31:38.127 --> 31:39.628
MM-HMM.

31:39.628 --> 31:41.630
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH

31:41.630 --> 31:44.203
SOME REALLY HEAVY THINGS
RECENTLY.

31:44.203 --> 31:46.205
I DON'T WANT
TO GET INTO IT NOW.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.177
BUT THE--THE POINT IS,

31:48.177 --> 31:50.579
THIS MORNING, I WAS OUT
ON THE VENICE PIER,

31:50.579 --> 31:52.241
AND...

31:52.241 --> 31:55.114
AND I WAS THINKING
ABOUT COMMITTING SUICIDE.

31:55.114 --> 31:56.615
OH, MY GOD!

31:56.615 --> 31:58.517
IT'S OKAY. I'M--I'M OKAY.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.350
I SAW A GLIMPSE
OF MY FUTURE,

32:01.350 --> 32:04.623
AND I WAS ALIVE.

32:04.623 --> 32:08.057
YOU KNOW, AND EVERYTHING'S
CHANGED FOR ME NOW.

32:08.057 --> 32:11.060
WHATEVER I WAS THINKING
ABOUT DOING

32:11.060 --> 32:14.133
OBVIOUSLY WASN'T MEANT
TO HAPPEN.

32:14.133 --> 32:16.535
IT--IT'S LIKE A SIGN FROM GOD
OR SOMETHING.

32:16.535 --> 32:19.408
YOU KNOW,
THESE VISIONS WERE A GIFT.

32:19.408 --> 32:22.511
DON'T YOU THINK?

32:24.413 --> 32:26.115
A GIFT?

32:26.115 --> 32:28.117
I DON'T KNOW. NOT FOR ME.

32:28.117 --> 32:30.049
WHY? WHAT--WHAT DID YOU SEE?

32:33.652 --> 32:36.255
I SAW
THE END OF MY MARRIAGE.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.061
I WAS DRINKING AGAIN,

32:42.061 --> 32:43.462
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD.

32:43.462 --> 32:46.465
AND IN MY HEAD, I...

32:46.465 --> 32:49.338
I KNOW IT WASN'T
JUST A ONE-TIME THING.

32:49.338 --> 32:52.101
I WAS FULL-FLEDGED
DRINKING AGAIN.

32:52.101 --> 32:54.473
ALL THE ANXIETY,

32:54.473 --> 32:56.105
SHAME.

32:56.105 --> 32:57.646
(whispers) IT WAS ALL BACK.

32:57.646 --> 33:02.111
JUST BECAUSE YOU SAW THAT
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

33:02.111 --> 33:06.555
EVEN IF THIS FUTURE STUFF
IS REAL,

33:06.555 --> 33:08.557
MAYBE IT'S
A BLESSING IN DISGUISE.

33:08.557 --> 33:11.660
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU SAW IT,
YOU CAN CHANGE IT.

33:11.660 --> 33:14.493
GHOST OF CHRISTMAS FUTURE
CRAP.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.265
WHAT IF I CAN'T?

33:16.265 --> 33:20.269
PEOPLE RELAPSE. I DID.
YOU PICK YOURSELF UP AGAIN.

33:20.269 --> 33:23.272
OLIVIA SAID SHE'D--
SHE'D LEAVE ME IF I SLIP AGAIN.

33:23.272 --> 33:25.274
SHE MADE THAT CLEAR.
THEN DON'T SLIP.

33:27.206 --> 33:30.409
UNTIL YOU SEE SOMETHING
THAT CORROBORATES THESE VISIONS,

33:30.409 --> 33:32.381
IT--IT'S ALL FANTASY.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.543
THE FUTURE IS STILL
UP IN THE AIR.

33:34.543 --> 33:37.216
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE SPONSOR.
YOU KNOW THAT?
(sets down mug)

33:37.216 --> 33:39.218
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, MARK?

33:39.218 --> 33:42.151
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE THIS--
THIS HAS HAPPENED TO, YOU KNOW?

33:42.151 --> 33:46.125
I'VE GOT
THE OPPOSITE PROBLEM.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.657
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

33:48.657 --> 33:53.031
TRACY WAS KILLED
IN AFGHANISTAN.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.404
AND YOU WERE
AT THE FUNERAL, RIGHT?
RIGHT.

33:55.404 --> 34:00.239
BUT IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

34:00.239 --> 34:02.271
SHE'S ALIVE.

34:02.271 --> 34:07.076
(explosion in distance)
DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.
THEY I.D.'ed HER REMAINS.

34:07.076 --> 34:09.078
I KNOW.

34:10.479 --> 34:13.222
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT, BUT...

34:13.222 --> 34:16.155
IT WAS HER.
I'M--I'M CERTAIN OF IT.

34:16.155 --> 34:20.259
AND IF SHE'S OUT THERE
SOMEWHERE, SHE NEEDS ME.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.465
FOR TWO YEARS, I'VE--
I'VE BEEN PUTTING HER TO REST.

34:26.465 --> 34:30.068
NOW... I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO THINK.

34:30.068 --> 34:32.241
I-I'M--I'M CONFUSED.

34:32.241 --> 34:33.802
I'M...

34:36.575 --> 34:37.806
HOPEFUL.

34:40.479 --> 34:45.083
AND I'M ANGRY
THAT I'M HOPEFUL.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.185
(sighs)

34:48.457 --> 34:52.491
YOU'RE WORRIED...

34:52.491 --> 34:55.594
YOUR FUTURE'S
GONNA COME TRUE.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.397
I'M WORRIED MINE WON'T.

35:05.374 --> 35:08.537
(Mojave 3's "All Your Tears"
playing)

35:12.281 --> 35:15.284
(garage door whirring)

35:30.128 --> 35:31.660
YOU FIXED THE GARAGE DOOR.

35:31.660 --> 35:33.532
IT WAS A SLOW DAY.

35:33.532 --> 35:37.466
â™ª WHERE'S THE MAGIC
THAT YOU WEAR? â™ª

35:39.908 --> 35:46.615
â™ª THAT KEEPS YOU SAFE
AND KEEPS YOU FEELING FREE â™ª

35:46.615 --> 35:48.677
â™ª WHOSE ARMS HAVE HELD YOU â™ª

35:48.677 --> 35:52.181
â™ª THAT YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU ARE ANYMORE â™ª

35:52.181 --> 35:54.483
DO YOU REMEMBER OUR SONG?

35:54.483 --> 35:56.425
WHAT?

35:56.425 --> 35:58.687
THE ONE WE DANCED TO
AT OUR WEDDING.

35:58.687 --> 36:01.290
ETTA JAMES. "AT LAST."

36:01.290 --> 36:04.863
(chuckles)

36:04.863 --> 36:07.666
RIGHT.

36:07.666 --> 36:10.199
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

36:10.199 --> 36:13.372
(sighs)

36:13.372 --> 36:16.174
I WAS AT THE OFFICE,

36:16.174 --> 36:17.606
WORKING ON A CASE.

36:17.606 --> 36:20.178
IT WAS--IT WAS THIS--

36:20.178 --> 36:22.681
WHAT CAUSED
THE FLASH-FORWARDS.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.454
I GOT THE SENSE
I WAS IN DANGER. THEN...

36:25.454 --> 36:27.886
THEN IT ENDED.

36:27.886 --> 36:29.288
NOTHING ELSE?

36:32.190 --> 36:34.863
NO, THAT WAS IT.

36:37.266 --> 36:38.927
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

36:42.531 --> 36:43.932
BABE?

36:45.704 --> 36:48.307
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

36:48.307 --> 36:49.438
WHY?

36:49.438 --> 36:51.480
'CAUSE IT WAS
TOO UPSETTING.

36:51.480 --> 36:54.483
I NEED TO HEAR IT,
WHATEVER IT WAS.

36:54.483 --> 36:57.486
NO.

36:57.486 --> 36:59.488
NO, YOU DON'T.

37:02.521 --> 37:05.254
(whispers) COME ON.
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

37:10.559 --> 37:14.333
YOU KNOW WHAT?
JUST... LET IT GO.

37:16.665 --> 37:20.509
(normal voice)
OLIVIA, WHAT DID YOU SEE?

37:27.376 --> 37:30.248
(crying)
I WAS WITH ANOTHER MAN.

37:31.980 --> 37:33.922
(whispers) WHO?

37:33.922 --> 37:36.455
I DON'T KNOW.

37:36.455 --> 37:38.887
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE.

37:49.037 --> 37:52.541
HE WAS DOWNSTAIRS.

37:52.541 --> 37:54.543
I DON'T KNOW WHO HE WAS,

37:54.543 --> 37:58.347
AND YET MY VISION--
I HAD ALL THESE INTENSE...

37:58.347 --> 38:00.949
(cries) FEELINGS FOR HIM.
I...

38:00.949 --> 38:03.352
(voice echoes) HEY, HONEY.

38:08.056 --> 38:09.958
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, MARK.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.461
I WOULD NEVER CHEAT ON YOU.

38:12.461 --> 38:15.464
I WOULDN'T BETRAY YOU.
I WOULDN'T--I...

38:20.599 --> 38:22.601
JUST BECAUSE WE SAW
THESE THINGS

38:22.601 --> 38:24.903
DOESN'T MEAN
THEY'RE GONNA HAPPEN.

38:42.921 --> 38:44.393
DYLAN!

38:44.393 --> 38:45.694
UH, I'M SORRY.
YOU ARE...

38:45.694 --> 38:47.726
(British accent)
HIS FATHER LLOYD SIMCOE.

38:47.726 --> 38:50.959
HOW IS HE?
HE'LL BE FINE.

38:50.959 --> 38:52.601
HIS ATTENDING PHYSICIAN,
DR. BENFORD,

38:52.601 --> 38:54.603
WILL BE HERE
IN THE MORNING.

38:54.603 --> 38:57.736
SHE CAN FILL YOU IN
ON SOME OF THE DETAILS.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.469
THEN I'LL WAIT FOR HER.

39:15.984 --> 39:17.956
(whispering) DADDY?

39:17.956 --> 39:21.059
WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP,
SWEETIE?

39:21.059 --> 39:22.961
IT'S AFTER MIDNIGHT.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.133
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

39:25.133 --> 39:27.896
COME HERE.

39:27.896 --> 39:30.068
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT IT?

39:30.068 --> 39:32.701
(normal voice)
WHY WAS MOMMY CRYING?

39:32.701 --> 39:37.906
OH, SHE WAS JUST SCARED.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

39:37.906 --> 39:39.708
ARE YOU SCARED?

39:39.708 --> 39:43.011
NO, HONEY. I'M FINE.

39:47.385 --> 39:50.388
WHAT DO YOU HAVE THERE?
WHAT DO YOU GOT IN YOUR HAND?

39:50.388 --> 39:53.021
HMM?
SOMETHING I MADE FOR YOU.

39:53.021 --> 39:55.464
I WANT YOU TO HAVE IT.

39:58.567 --> 40:00.469
TAKE IT, DADDY.

40:02.931 --> 40:07.976
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HELP YOU PUT IT ON?

40:11.740 --> 40:13.942
SURE.

40:13.942 --> 40:15.413
OKAY.

40:23.552 --> 40:25.554
THERE YOU GO.

40:49.578 --> 40:52.581
I'M STILL AT WORK, BABE.
(Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton)
â™ª ISLANDS IN THE STREAM â™ª

40:52.581 --> 40:54.983
MM, THEY GOT US WORKING LATE.
â™ª THAT IS WHAT WE ARE â™ª

40:54.983 --> 40:58.226
YEAH, I'M WATCHING IT
RIGHT NOW.
â™ª NO ONE IN BETWEEN,
HOW CAN WE BE WRONG? â™ª

40:58.226 --> 41:02.130
â™ª SAIL AWAY WITH ME â™ª
IF, UH, THIS IS
THE SONG YOU WANT,

41:02.130 --> 41:04.132
YOU GOT IT, BABY.
â™ª TO ANOTHER WORLD â™ª

41:04.132 --> 41:06.735
(laughs)
â™ª AND WE RELY
ON EACH OTHER, UH-HUH â™ª

41:06.735 --> 41:08.997
â™ª FROM ONE LOVER
TO ANOTHER, UH-HUH â™ª

41:08.997 --> 41:12.741
LET'S, UM, LET'S TALK ABOUT
THE FUTURE WHEN YOU GET HOME.

41:12.741 --> 41:15.003
DEM, COME HERE.
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS.

41:15.003 --> 41:17.005
â™ª THAT IS WHAT WE ARE â™ª
GOTTA GO.

41:17.005 --> 41:18.707
â™ª NO ONE IN BETWEEN â™ª

41:18.707 --> 41:20.579
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

41:23.612 --> 41:26.084
WHAT'S UP?

41:26.084 --> 41:29.057
OKAY, SO AS FAR AS WE KNOW,

41:29.057 --> 41:31.489
EVERY SINGLE PERSON
ON THE ENTIRE PLANET

41:31.489 --> 41:34.563
LOST CONSCIOUSNESS AT THE EXACT
SAME PERIOD OF TIME, RIGHT?

41:34.563 --> 41:37.265
RIGHT.
OKAY, SO I STARTED CYCLING
THROUGH

41:37.265 --> 41:40.168
A BUNCH OF SURVEILLANCE CAMERAS
FOR THE LAST FIVE HOURS...

41:40.168 --> 41:43.271
(hits key)
BECAUSE I WAS CURIOUS TO SEE
WHAT THEY RECORDED.

41:43.271 --> 41:45.503
I LOOKED AT HUNDREDS OF 'EM.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.636
I CHECKED EVERY MAJOR CITY, EVEN
WEB CAMS IN OTHER COUNTRIES...
(types)

41:47.636 --> 41:49.778
AND THEY ALL SHOW
THE EXACT SAME THING.

41:49.778 --> 41:52.510
AT 11:00 A.M., PEOPLE START
DROPPING LIKE FLIES.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.083
OKAY, AND THEN 2 MINUTES
AND 17 SECONDS LATER,

41:55.083 --> 41:59.047
THEY START TO COME TO.
AND THEN I SAW THIS.

41:59.047 --> 42:00.048
(hits key)

42:00.048 --> 42:02.791
THIS WAS IN DETROIT.

42:02.791 --> 42:05.624
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT HERE?
JUST HANG ON A SECOND.

42:05.624 --> 42:09.297
(hits keys)
RIGHT THERE.
LOOK RIGHT THERE.

42:16.765 --> 42:17.936
NO WAY.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.067
YEAH.

42:19.067 --> 42:22.711
WHO THE HELL IS THAT?

42:24.212 --> 42:26.544
AND WHY ARE THEY AWAKE?

42:26.544 --> 42:27.946
(hits key)
