WEBVTT

00:01.911 --> 00:04.556
Previously on Star Trek: Enterprise...

00:04.556 --> 00:06.220
I know you are on an urgent mission.

00:06.220 --> 00:07.399
Who are you?

00:07.399 --> 00:08.981
Don't be frightened.

00:08.981 --> 00:10.149
What do you want?

00:10.149 --> 00:11.877
You are searching for something.

00:11.877 --> 00:14.179
I can help.

00:15.423 --> 00:18.710
He was horrified that seven million of us were killed.

00:18.710 --> 00:23.829
He says he's willing to use his abilities to help us find the Xindi.

00:23.829 --> 00:24.982
What's this?

00:24.982 --> 00:27.483
It helps me extend the range of my telepathy.

00:27.483 --> 00:29.460
He gave me these coordinates.

00:29.460 --> 00:30.260
What are they for?

00:30.260 --> 00:31.483
A Xindi colony.

00:31.483 --> 00:35.069
He said they were building part of the weapon there.

00:37.063 --> 00:42.199
We're preparing to test the weapon on an uninhabited planet in the Calindra System,

00:42.199 --> 00:49.458
but we're going to need another shipment of kemocite-- at least 100 kilograms.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.856
I'll contact Gralik.

00:51.856 --> 00:58.935
If the test is successful, how long before we can deploy the weapon?

00:58.935 --> 01:01.112
A matter of weeks.

01:04.260 --> 01:08.478
Song: "Faith of the Heart"
It's been a long road,

01:08.478 --> 01:11.899
Getting from there to here,

01:11.899 --> 01:15.527
It's been a long time,

01:15.527 --> 01:19.680
But my time is finally near,

01:19.680 --> 01:23.816
And I will see my dream come alive at last,

01:23.816 --> 01:27.467
I will touch the sky

01:27.467 --> 01:31.244
And they're not gonna hold me down no more,

01:31.244 --> 01:34.232
No they're not gonna change my mind,

01:34.232 --> 01:39.246
Cause I've got faith of the heart,

01:39.246 --> 01:41.843
I'm going where my heart will take me,

01:41.843 --> 01:47.276
I've got faith to believe,

01:47.276 --> 01:49.654
I can do anything,

01:49.654 --> 01:57.469
I've got strength of the soul,
But no one gonna bend or break me,

01:57.469 --> 02:03.425
I can reach, any star,

02:03.425 --> 02:06.998
I've got faith,

02:06.998 --> 02:14.628
I've got faith, faith of the heart.

02:23.439 --> 02:26.095
059 (3x07) The Shipment

02:32.777 --> 02:35.097
There are no defensive systems?

02:35.097 --> 02:38.334
No active sensor sweeps or artificial satellites.

02:38.334 --> 02:41.633
No vessels anywhere in the vicinity.

02:41.633 --> 02:45.119
We've seen how different Xindi technology is.

02:45.119 --> 02:48.482
They could have defenses we can't detect.

02:48.482 --> 02:50.377
It's also possible that what we were told

02:50.377 --> 02:54.133
about this colony isn't accurate.

02:54.133 --> 03:00.799
We're putting a lot of faith in Hoshi's telepathic friend.

03:04.014 --> 03:06.433
What about these energy readings?

03:06.433 --> 03:08.620
They could be coming from a weapons complex.

03:08.620 --> 03:12.576
They could also be electrical storms, deposits of diamagnetic ore...

03:12.576 --> 03:14.895
Or a glitch in our sensors. I know.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.693
But, if there's any chance that something on that planet

03:16.693 --> 03:21.592
could lead us to the Xindi weapon, we have to investigate it.

03:23.063 --> 03:25.796
After we enter the system, we'll stay on the far side of that moon.

03:25.796 --> 03:27.678
It should keep us out of view.

03:27.678 --> 03:30.925
Tell Major Hayes he'll be joining us on a reconnaissance mission.

03:30.925 --> 03:32.538
We launch in two hours.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.737
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

03:41.737 --> 03:45.383
I've found a landing site 12 kilometers north of the energy readings.

03:45.383 --> 03:47.344
Any sign they've detected us?

03:47.344 --> 03:49.101
Scans are still negative.

03:49.101 --> 03:51.490
Your signal is breaking up.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.925
I've set a steep approach vector.

03:53.925 --> 03:56.498
And we've ionized the hull.

03:56.498 --> 03:59.712
- It'll help disperse any scanning beams.
- Acknowledged.

03:59.712 --> 04:02.614
Anyone sees us, they'll think we're a meteor.

04:14.026 --> 04:17.632
- How much farther?
- 800 meters.

04:19.805 --> 04:21.772
Just over that rise.

04:39.522 --> 04:42.943
That's definitely the source of the energy readings.

04:51.466 --> 04:52.576
They're Xindi.

04:52.576 --> 04:54.569
- Reptilian?
- No.

04:54.569 --> 04:57.675
One of the other species we saw in the database.

05:02.099 --> 05:06.352
We've picked up readings across the spectrum-- positron emissions, antiproton bursts.

05:06.352 --> 05:08.814
Whatever they're doing in there, it's using a lot of power.

05:08.814 --> 05:11.283
Corporal Hawkins is standing by with an assault team.

05:11.283 --> 05:13.412
Tell him to keep standing by.

05:13.412 --> 05:16.071
I'm not ready to send in the troops just yet.

05:16.071 --> 05:18.205
We've checked out the perimeter of the complex.

05:18.205 --> 05:20.772
I think we can get inside without being detected.

05:20.772 --> 05:23.732
We'll maintain communications silence inside the complex.

05:23.732 --> 05:25.622
I'll contact you at 0400.

05:25.622 --> 05:26.984
Archer out.

05:41.339 --> 05:43.354
I'm not picking up any security devices.

05:43.354 --> 05:44.836
What about people?

05:44.836 --> 05:50.849
Approximately 80 inside the complex, but none within 100 meters.

06:21.717 --> 06:26.465
Captain. Some kind of radiolytic compound.

06:26.465 --> 06:28.529
Doesn't match anything in our database.

06:28.529 --> 06:30.986
There's several hundred kilograms in this room.

06:36.452 --> 06:39.699
There were impurities in the last three production cycles.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.262
We found a ruptured seal in the tertiary processing chamber.

06:43.262 --> 06:44.403
It's been repaired.

06:44.403 --> 06:47.482
We'll have to increase the production rate by at least 60%.

06:47.482 --> 06:48.898
Assign two additional teams.

06:48.898 --> 06:50.944
Degra isn't being realistic.

06:50.944 --> 06:54.864
This facility wasn't designed to manufacture such large quantities.

06:57.639 --> 07:00.132
Your job is to synthesize kemocite.

07:00.132 --> 07:03.539
I suggest you get back to it.

07:04.402 --> 07:06.213
Have these canisters retested.

07:06.213 --> 07:09.628
Salvage what you can, then destroy the rest.

07:51.856 --> 07:53.173
We have it, Captain.

07:53.173 --> 07:59.220
- I need an analysis a soon as possible.
- Acknowledged.

07:59.220 --> 08:04.434
Captain, this place obviously has something to do with the weapon.

08:04.434 --> 08:06.876
Seems to me, the sooner we put it out of commission, the better.

08:06.876 --> 08:08.395
Two spatial charges.

08:08.395 --> 08:11.281
That's all it would take to destroy the complex from orbit.

08:11.281 --> 08:14.187
That might set them back for a while,

08:14.187 --> 08:17.654
but we can't lose sight of our main objective.

08:17.654 --> 08:21.213
I want to know where they're shipping this kemocite.

08:21.213 --> 08:24.168
It could lead us to the weapon.

09:11.146 --> 09:14.906
I have some questions for you.

09:22.408 --> 09:27.563
Who are you?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.018
What do you want from me?

09:30.018 --> 09:31.572
Sit down!

09:32.732 --> 09:34.486
There's nobody else here, sir.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.893
Apparently he lives alone.

09:39.555 --> 09:41.938
Stand watch outside.

09:48.389 --> 09:53.019
- What's your name?
- Gralik Durr.

09:53.019 --> 09:55.971
My name's Jonathan Archer.

09:55.971 --> 09:58.808
I'm from Earth.

09:58.808 --> 10:04.128
Is that supposed to explain why you've forced your way into my home?

10:06.861 --> 10:12.401
- Tell me about kemocite.
- It's a multiphasic isotope.

10:12.401 --> 10:16.107
- Used for what?
- There are numerous applications.

10:16.107 --> 10:19.610
It depends on the level of refinement.

10:23.140 --> 10:28.236
You're working with someone named Degra.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.016
Who is he?

10:30.016 --> 10:34.473
That's none of your concern.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.074
What's he using it for?

10:44.074 --> 10:47.580
Kemocite can be used for any number of purposes.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.850
I don't make a habit of asking our clients what they plan to do with it.

10:50.850 --> 10:56.403
Maybe you should, because this batch is being used to create a weapon to exterminate my people!

10:56.403 --> 10:57.152
What?

10:57.152 --> 10:58.869
I want to know where the weapon is being built

10:58.869 --> 11:00.477
and when it's gong to be ready.

11:00.477 --> 11:02.821
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:02.821 --> 11:06.399
I'm not leaving here until I get the answers I need.

11:13.602 --> 11:17.251
I managed to identify a subquantum imprint.

11:17.251 --> 11:19.651
It matches the signature of the Xindi probe.

11:19.651 --> 11:21.504
There's no doubt about it, Captain.

11:21.504 --> 11:24.732
This isotope was used in the weapon that attacked Earth.

11:24.732 --> 11:26.892
Have you learned anything from the interrogation?

11:26.892 --> 11:28.753
Not yet, but this should help.

11:28.753 --> 11:30.341
There's something else, Captain.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.141
I ran a scan on that rifle we picked up.

11:32.141 --> 11:34.824
There it was again, the same quantum imprint.

11:34.824 --> 11:38.416
I'd like permission to take it apart.

11:38.416 --> 11:39.912
Go ahead.

11:39.912 --> 11:42.252
We'll contact you in a couple of hours.

11:42.252 --> 11:43.783
Understood.

11:45.755 --> 11:48.573
Congratulations, sir.

11:48.573 --> 11:54.095
Three months ago, we entered the Expanse with no idea who these Xindi were or how to find them,

11:54.095 --> 11:58.353
and now we're about to destroy one of their weapons facilities.

12:05.812 --> 12:10.105
I thought we were here to try and stop a war, not start one.

12:10.105 --> 12:11.650
They struck first.

12:11.650 --> 12:14.611
Because they were told we're going to attack them.

12:14.611 --> 12:17.213
They think they're acting in self-defense.

12:17.213 --> 12:18.891
By destroying this complex,

12:18.891 --> 12:21.875
we'll be confirming their worst fears about humanity.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.820
Let's not forget the seven million people who were killed.

12:38.135 --> 12:42.963
Have Major Hayes lay down blast suppressors.

12:42.963 --> 12:50.130
When the facility goes, I don't want to take the rest of the settlement with it.

12:54.133 --> 12:56.252
Whatbout Gralik, sir?

12:56.252 --> 12:59.987
He'll tell them about Enterprise.

13:01.271 --> 13:03.990
I'll deal with Gralik when the time comes.

13:06.072 --> 13:09.065
I don't intend to let anyone know we were here.

13:11.790 --> 13:14.141
I can't imagine what the captain wants this for.

13:14.141 --> 13:15.995
He was quite insistent.

13:15.995 --> 13:19.619
We ran the quantum analysis three times.

13:19.619 --> 13:21.376
Doesn't he trust us?

13:21.376 --> 13:25.754
He said he needed it to help prove a point.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.305
How long are you going to keep me here?

13:33.305 --> 13:35.349
That's up to Captain Archer.

13:35.349 --> 13:38.562
Well, you can tell him that I'll be in my study.

13:38.562 --> 13:40.688
I'm afraid you're going to have to stay right here.

13:40.688 --> 13:42.104
I have work to do.

13:42.104 --> 13:43.999
And I'm under orders.

13:43.999 --> 13:46.067
Please sit down.

13:47.129 --> 13:50.053
I've already told you everything I know.

13:52.781 --> 13:54.173
Ah, Captain Archer!

13:54.173 --> 13:57.790
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten about me.

14:03.974 --> 14:06.921
You said you weren't involved in building weapons.

14:06.921 --> 14:08.796
That's correct.

14:08.796 --> 14:10.883
Explain this.

14:17.689 --> 14:19.117
I don't know what this is.

14:19.117 --> 14:23.235
It's a fragment of a probe that murdered seven million people.

14:26.880 --> 14:32.065
The dead pilot was Xindi, the alloy is Xindi,

14:32.065 --> 14:35.630
and it's imprinted with the quantum signature of the compound you produce here!

14:35.630 --> 14:38.635
We know you're constructing a larger version of the weapon,

14:38.635 --> 14:40.140
big enough to destroy a planet!

14:40.140 --> 14:42.482
I want to know where it's being built!

14:44.191 --> 14:56.849
You burst into my home, show me some twisted piece of metal and tell me it proves I'm a mass murderer?!

14:56.849 --> 14:59.924
I've never seen your species before.

14:59.924 --> 15:01.658
I've never heard of a planet called Earth,

15:01.658 --> 15:07.617
and whether you believe me or not, I had nothing to do with killing millions of its inhabitants.

15:14.439 --> 15:16.849
I'm flattered you requested my assistance, Commander,

15:16.849 --> 15:20.827
but weaponry isn't exactly my area of expertise.

15:20.827 --> 15:23.597
Well, my scans of this thing showed organic components,

15:23.597 --> 15:28.879
and I figured anything biological is more your turf than mine.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.937
What do you think?

15:37.605 --> 15:41.634
Well, they appear to be generating synaptic impulses.

15:48.031 --> 15:51.158
Is it alive?

15:52.875 --> 15:58.045
Wouldn't make a very good pet but, uh... definitely organic.

16:03.214 --> 16:06.414
And it seems to have reproductive capabilities.

16:09.894 --> 16:13.089
The kemocite is extremely refined.

16:13.089 --> 16:14.805
Did it come from this facility?

16:14.805 --> 16:16.855
It did.

16:16.855 --> 16:21.097
We supply many species with kemocite, not just Xindi.

16:21.097 --> 16:24.216
It has countless applications.

16:24.216 --> 16:27.728
When Degra requested shipments so highly refined,

16:27.728 --> 16:32.215
we celebrated, realizing the wealth it would bring to our colony.

16:32.215 --> 16:35.928
We never considered why he wanted such pure kemocite.

16:35.928 --> 16:39.040
Perhaps our greed blinded us from the possibility

16:39.040 --> 16:42.181
that it would be used in constructing a weapon.

16:42.181 --> 16:43.743
Is Degra a Reptilian?

16:43.743 --> 16:48.310
No, he's a Xindi-Primate.

16:48.310 --> 16:51.429
I met one... at a mining complex.

16:51.429 --> 16:54.569
They're similar to you, ape-like.

16:54.569 --> 16:58.718
Degra and his people have always been fair... truthful.

16:58.718 --> 17:02.946
That may have been why I believed him when he said the shipment was for research.

17:02.946 --> 17:08.559
Perhaps they've become as untrustworthy as the Reptilians.

17:08.559 --> 17:12.039
We've run into a few of them, too.

17:12.751 --> 17:18.017
It's hard to imagine five sentient species evolving on the same planet.

17:18.017 --> 17:20.426
Five?

17:20.426 --> 17:24.779
Hmm, I suppose there are now.

17:26.078 --> 17:27.082
No, thanks.

17:27.082 --> 17:28.334
Do you mind?

17:28.334 --> 17:30.374
No, go ahead.

17:34.597 --> 17:36.004
Mmm...

17:36.004 --> 17:40.821
There was a sixth species, the Avians.

17:40.821 --> 17:42.630
They've been gone since the war.

17:42.630 --> 17:43.525
Gone?

17:43.525 --> 17:45.098
Extinct.

17:45.098 --> 17:51.068
As far as I'm told, none of them fled before our homeworld was destroyed.

17:51.068 --> 17:53.576
We found some debris.

17:53.576 --> 17:55.079
How did it happen?

17:55.079 --> 17:57.892
The war went on for nearly a hundred years.

17:57.892 --> 18:01.877
The sides changed, alliances were forged, then broken.

18:01.877 --> 18:04.712
By the time it ended, I doubt if any of the six species

18:04.712 --> 18:10.749
remember what started it... but everyone remembered what ended it.

18:10.749 --> 18:13.886
As well as being unstable politically,

18:13.886 --> 18:20.315
our planet was even more unstable geologically.

18:20.315 --> 18:28.073
In a final, desperate act, the Insectoids and the Reptilians detonated massive explosions

18:28.073 --> 18:34.077
beneath the eight largest seismic fissures.

18:34.077 --> 18:36.373
I'd like to think they didn't realize

18:36.373 --> 18:41.155
how devastating the result would be.

18:45.342 --> 18:47.961
My grandfather lived there.

18:47.961 --> 18:56.042
He told me of places where the sky was sometimes filled with Avians.

18:56.042 --> 19:00.801
Now they're gone.

19:01.952 --> 19:05.211
The other five species did survive.

19:05.211 --> 19:09.644
From what I can tell, they don't all live on remote colonies like this one.

19:09.644 --> 19:16.333
The descendants of those that escaped are scattered across the Expanse.

19:16.333 --> 19:21.488
Many live peaceful lives, but obviously not all.

19:21.488 --> 19:25.106
- Captain?
- I'll be right back.

19:25.106 --> 19:31.699
- Sir?
- It's okay.

19:34.248 --> 19:35.754
The suppressors are in place.

19:35.754 --> 19:38.559
The blast wave should be mostly confined to the facility.

19:38.559 --> 19:41.380
Sir, I noticed a lot of activity down there.

19:41.380 --> 19:45.360
It seemed like something is going on.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.303
Archer.

19:48.303 --> 19:51.516
Captain, we've detected a ship approaching the planet.

19:51.516 --> 19:56.263
The hull configuration matches the Xindi vessel that attacked us.

19:57.819 --> 19:59.694
Reptilians.

20:19.008 --> 20:23.133
Recognize anyone?

20:26.877 --> 20:30.948
The Reptilians seem rather upset about something.

20:46.987 --> 20:48.775
You got something?

20:48.775 --> 20:51.783
I've been running scans of the weapon's organic component.

20:51.783 --> 20:56.514
It's neural pathways appear to help modulate the rifle's power output.

20:56.514 --> 20:59.967
It's the most sophisticated example of bio-mechanical engineering I've ever seen.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.582
You said you had good news, Doc.

21:01.582 --> 21:02.890
Ah, yes.

21:02.890 --> 21:06.959
I've been attempting to break down this creature's immune system.

21:06.959 --> 21:08.884
You're trying to make it sick?

21:08.884 --> 21:10.892
Mm. However, it's proving to be quite resilient.

21:10.892 --> 21:13.514
I've tried an array of viruses and pathogenes

21:13.514 --> 21:15.981
but it's immune to all of them, then

21:15.981 --> 21:20.530
I began exposing it to various radioactive spectre

21:20.530 --> 21:24.902
A sustained burst of delta radiation.

21:27.298 --> 21:30.548
If we rig up portable EM emitters,

21:30.548 --> 21:34.450
We could knock out Reptilian weapons before any of them get a chance to pull the trigger.

21:34.450 --> 21:35.381
In theory.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.115
Unfortunately, the amount of radiation required would be

21:38.115 --> 21:40.826
extremely hazardous to any humans in the area.

21:40.826 --> 21:42.649
It's still a place to start.

21:42.649 --> 21:43.844
Great work, Doc.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.877
Keep at it.

21:44.877 --> 21:47.174
Oh, and, Commander...

21:47.174 --> 21:53.324
I'd avoid exposing any of the Xindi technology to omicron radiation.

21:53.324 --> 21:56.938
It seems to thrive on it as you can see.

21:56.938 --> 22:00.486
I'll keep that in mind.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.913
They're ahead of schedule.

22:01.913 --> 22:04.859
We weren't expecting them for another three days.

22:04.859 --> 22:08.068
You might not have much time left to accomplish your mission.

22:08.068 --> 22:09.910
What makes you say that?

22:09.910 --> 22:13.844
We've been processing kemocite for them for nearly six months.

22:13.844 --> 22:17.289
They're here for their final shipment.

22:17.289 --> 22:21.551
Captain, I'm the primary technician at this facility.

22:21.551 --> 22:24.395
They'll want to talk to me before accepting delivery.

22:24.395 --> 22:29.572
To confirm that all of their technical requirements have been met.

22:29.572 --> 22:38.401
I may be able to obtain some information for you about this weapon.

22:38.401 --> 22:41.686
That could be dangerous.

22:41.686 --> 22:45.482
I'm willing to take that risk.

22:48.412 --> 22:52.420
How do I know you won't expose us-- tell them about Enterprise?

22:52.420 --> 22:56.327
I'm proud of my craft, Captain.

22:56.327 --> 22:59.412
I've practiced it for many years.

22:59.412 --> 23:04.209
I won't let my work be corrupted in this way.

23:04.209 --> 23:09.422
Seven million people.

23:09.422 --> 23:17.298
If I'd chosen my clients more carefully, that tragedy might not have happened.

23:17.298 --> 23:21.785
I don't intend to let it happen again.

23:26.837 --> 23:27.729
Archer.

23:27.729 --> 23:31.338
Captain, there are two Xindi bio-signs heading this way.

23:47.883 --> 23:49.803
Gralik, are you there?

23:52.637 --> 23:54.147
Gralik!

24:17.237 --> 24:19.325
Degra's probably wondering where I am.

24:19.325 --> 24:23.037
His companions don't like to be kept waiting.

24:25.701 --> 24:27.410
Captain.

24:30.190 --> 24:31.060
They've gone.

24:31.060 --> 24:34.140
They'll return... probably with armed Reptilians.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.510
Just because you didn't show up for work?

24:36.510 --> 24:39.356
There are fewer than a hundred people on this planet.

24:39.356 --> 24:42.842
It doesn't go unnoticed when one of them is missing.

24:42.842 --> 24:48.783
Degra won't leave until he sees the results of the final isotopic analysis.

24:48.783 --> 24:51.987
You should reconsider my offer.

24:54.394 --> 24:56.789
That's good, right there.

24:56.789 --> 24:58.288
Are you sure this is wise?

24:58.288 --> 25:00.550
That's four inches of solid duranium.

25:00.550 --> 25:03.841
If this thing can blast a hole through it, then we're in even worse trouble than we thought.

25:03.841 --> 25:08.483
Still, it might be prudent to find a more suitable environment to test it.

25:08.483 --> 25:11.395
We don't have time to go looking for some deserted asteroid,

25:11.395 --> 25:12.513
If I may--

25:12.513 --> 25:16.185
Commander Tucker and I have learned all we can from examining the workings of the device.

25:16.185 --> 25:19.123
A practical test is the next logical step.

25:19.123 --> 25:23.477
I've rigged up four of Malcolm's forcefield emitters.

25:24.996 --> 25:27.687
They'll contain any blast debris.

25:27.687 --> 25:29.855
What about radiation and particle disbursement?

25:29.855 --> 25:31.730
We know nothing about this device.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.026
That's the point.

25:33.026 --> 25:36.216
Those Xindi took out half of our security force when they came aboard.

25:36.216 --> 25:39.029
Now, if we don't start making some progress understanding their weapons,

25:39.029 --> 25:42.974
we won't stand a chance in hell of beating them when the time comes.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.541
Let me know when you're ready.

25:49.541 --> 25:51.962
Give us an hour.

26:03.672 --> 26:05.518
More delays?

26:05.518 --> 26:07.974
We did surprise them by arriving early.

26:07.974 --> 26:09.564
That's no excuse.

26:09.564 --> 26:12.521
They should have been ready by now.

26:12.521 --> 26:16.168
Such lethargic creatures.

26:16.168 --> 26:18.156
You could learn something from them.

26:18.156 --> 26:20.357
Patience, for example.

26:22.387 --> 26:23.913
Where's Gralik?

26:23.913 --> 26:25.828
We can't find him.

26:25.828 --> 26:28.638
In a complex this size how difficult could it be?

26:28.638 --> 26:29.913
We've searched everywhere.

26:29.913 --> 26:31.477
No one's seen him.

26:31.477 --> 26:34.102
He often takes walks outside the settlement.

26:34.102 --> 26:35.425
Walks?

26:35.425 --> 26:37.803
Without his analysis, I can't proceed.

26:37.803 --> 26:40.004
We've organized search teams.

26:40.004 --> 26:43.433
We don't have time for you to go foraging through the forest.

26:43.433 --> 26:46.129
We'll find him ourselves.

27:03.614 --> 27:06.652
- What is it?
- Someone's closing on our position, sir.

27:06.652 --> 27:07.761
400 meters.

27:07.761 --> 27:10.623
- Reptilians?
- I'm not certain.

27:10.623 --> 27:14.667
- 350 meters.
- Stay with him.

27:18.936 --> 27:22.888
Still closing, sir. 200 meters.

27:22.888 --> 27:24.094
150.

27:24.094 --> 27:26.172
They're bloody fast, whoever they are.

27:30.852 --> 27:32.471
Take cover!

28:11.414 --> 28:13.142
It's a Seeker.

28:13.142 --> 28:15.446
The Reptilians built them for reconnaissance.

28:15.446 --> 28:18.757
They were used to great effect during the war.

28:18.757 --> 28:24.621
It seems as though you may have been exposed after all.

28:24.621 --> 28:27.030
Let's hope they didn't get a very good look at us.

28:27.030 --> 28:28.997
There's some caves not far ahead.

28:28.997 --> 28:31.296
They should provide us with cover--

28:31.296 --> 28:34.918
in case we encounter any more of those.

28:49.285 --> 28:52.132
- Ready, Doc?
- Ready.

29:02.153 --> 29:03.112
What's wrong?

29:03.112 --> 29:04.664
It won't fire.

29:04.664 --> 29:06.054
I don't understand.

29:06.054 --> 29:09.076
Perhaps it has a safety device.

29:09.076 --> 29:10.250
What's that?

29:10.250 --> 29:14.140
It's coming from the weapon.

29:14.140 --> 29:17.640
Looks like some kind of countdown.

29:17.640 --> 29:20.983
The energy levels are increasing.

29:20.983 --> 29:23.091
It's overloading.

29:23.091 --> 29:25.124
I can't shut it down.
Damn thing's booby-trapped.

29:25.124 --> 29:29.094
- If you remove the power cell...
- It'll just grow back.

30:00.351 --> 30:02.244
Quick thinking, Commander.

30:02.244 --> 30:03.686
You were right.

30:03.686 --> 30:08.344
We probably should have found a nice empty asteroid to test it on.

30:14.925 --> 30:16.484
The Xindi ship is still in orbit.

30:16.484 --> 30:18.533
We haven't detected any other vessels.

30:18.533 --> 30:19.767
Understood.

30:19.767 --> 30:22.889
Captain, if the Xindi have detected your presence,

30:22.889 --> 30:25.584
I strongly urge you to return to the ship.

30:25.584 --> 30:26.900
I appreciate your concern,

30:26.900 --> 30:29.950
but we still have a few loose ends to tie up down here.

30:29.950 --> 30:31.637
Archer out.

30:34.007 --> 30:36.845
- Anything?
- No, sir.

30:36.845 --> 30:38.509
We just might have stopped those bloodhounds

30:38.509 --> 30:41.634
before they transmitted our position.

30:41.634 --> 30:44.290
Let's hope so.

30:49.131 --> 30:51.016
No sign of the Reptlians.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.672
I doubt they'll find us.

30:53.672 --> 30:56.194
That's topaline ore.

30:56.194 --> 30:58.831
It should disrupt their scanners.

30:58.831 --> 31:02.907
Even their Seekers won't locate us here.

31:06.441 --> 31:12.898
What do you intend to do now, Captain, destroy our facility?

31:12.898 --> 31:15.660
Do you plan to wait until I'm back inside,

31:15.660 --> 31:20.918
or will you simply dispose of me here in the forest?

31:21.900 --> 31:25.115
I've been considering another option.

31:25.115 --> 31:28.927
I'd certainly like to hear it.

31:28.927 --> 31:35.269
The people on this colony had nothing to do with the attack on my planet.

31:35.269 --> 31:40.116
I'll be damned if I'm going to make them pay for it.

31:40.116 --> 31:42.456
You offered to help us.

31:42.456 --> 31:46.280
Are you still willing?

31:46.280 --> 31:49.685
If you're prepared to trust me.

31:54.072 --> 31:58.461
Then we'll give them their kemocite...

31:58.461 --> 32:03.102
but it won't be exactly what they ordered.

32:05.560 --> 32:06.918
Make sure he gets home safely.

32:06.918 --> 32:08.443
Yes, sir.

32:12.249 --> 32:17.301
It would be better if I went alone.

32:25.310 --> 32:31.994
- Good luck.
- And you.

32:35.680 --> 32:40.178
- Permission to speak freely.
- Go ahead.

32:40.178 --> 32:43.382
I'm not sure it was wise to let him go.

32:43.382 --> 32:45.315
He could lead the Reptilians back here.

32:45.315 --> 32:47.308
Are you speaking freely as well, Major?

32:47.308 --> 32:49.546
Just offering a tactical assessment, sir.

32:49.546 --> 32:51.628
Noted.

32:53.296 --> 32:56.461
He said he'd help us.

32:56.461 --> 32:58.428
I believe him.

32:59.649 --> 33:01.722
It's the captain.

33:01.722 --> 33:03.434
Go ahead, sir.

33:03.434 --> 33:05.893
Tell the army to hold off on those spatial charges.

33:05.893 --> 33:07.499
There's been a change of plans.

33:07.499 --> 33:08.980
Is everything all right?

33:08.980 --> 33:11.487
I'll let you know in a couple of hours.

33:11.487 --> 33:14.717
Right now, I have an assignment for you and Hoshi.

33:28.336 --> 33:29.881
They're looking for you.

33:29.881 --> 33:31.879
Have you started loading the shipment?

33:31.879 --> 33:33.014
Not yet.

33:33.014 --> 33:36.986
Good. I want to run another refinement test.

33:36.986 --> 33:38.726
We've completed three already.

33:38.726 --> 33:41.312
The impurities are less than six parts per million.

33:41.312 --> 33:45.017
We have to be absolutely certain that we've met their specifications.

33:45.017 --> 33:48.480
You know how important this is to all of us.

33:48.480 --> 33:50.123
We should get started.

33:50.123 --> 33:52.286
You two perform the isotopic analysis.

33:52.286 --> 33:54.908
I'll run the submolecular scans.

34:07.494 --> 34:08.982
We've got it.

34:08.982 --> 34:11.438
We've modified the radiolytic signature.

34:11.438 --> 34:13.914
If you can get it onboard, their ship, I'll be able to track it.

34:13.914 --> 34:15.934
Understood.

34:32.411 --> 34:33.556
Where were you?

34:33.556 --> 34:36.152
My personal activities aren't your concern.

34:36.152 --> 34:40.235
And do your personal activities involve destroying one of our Seekers?

34:40.235 --> 34:42.498
I was hunting tree scarabs.

34:42.498 --> 34:44.621
Your drone was frightening them.

34:44.621 --> 34:46.217
Who was with you?

34:46.217 --> 34:48.955
I prefer to spend my time in the forest alone.

34:48.955 --> 34:52.248
Our scans detected other bio-signs.

34:52.248 --> 34:53.337
I was alone.

34:53.337 --> 34:56.178
If you saw the drone, you knew we were here.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.088
Why didn't you return?

34:58.088 --> 35:00.523
You're two days early.

35:00.523 --> 35:02.158
What are you doing?

35:02.158 --> 35:03.552
Trying some final tests.

35:03.552 --> 35:04.781
What kind of tests?

35:04.781 --> 35:07.331
We were told the shipment was ready.

35:07.331 --> 35:12.320
42 years. That's how long I've been running this facility.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.315
And never once have I allowed a single gram of kemocite

35:15.315 --> 35:18.685
to leave the premises unless it was perfectly calibrated.

35:18.685 --> 35:19.969
I take pride in my work.

35:19.969 --> 35:21.660
But, if you're so eager to get underway,

35:21.660 --> 35:24.086
then go ahead, take your shipment!

35:24.086 --> 35:25.601
But, if it doesn't meet your requirements,

35:25.601 --> 35:28.836
don't expect me to produce another hundred kilograms overnight,

35:28.836 --> 35:33.081
because we do have other clients beside you.

35:35.031 --> 35:37.211
Finish quickly.

36:01.526 --> 36:04.387
There are two of them, loading containers.

36:04.387 --> 36:07.320
- Stand by, Captain.
- Acknowledged.

36:10.995 --> 36:12.286
They're heading back.

36:12.286 --> 36:15.103
You're clear, sir.

36:48.286 --> 36:51.390
Reed to Enterprise.

36:51.390 --> 36:52.779
Go ahead.

36:52.779 --> 36:55.662
The captain is inside the Xindi shuttle.

36:55.662 --> 36:57.509
Acknowledged.

37:31.462 --> 37:36.299
Captain? Three Xindi have just come out of the complex.

37:36.299 --> 37:37.956
Understood.

37:38.996 --> 37:40.710
Lieutenant Reed, report.

37:40.710 --> 37:42.552
We've run into a small problem.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.355
Stand by.

37:50.567 --> 37:52.256
We appreciate your efforts.

37:52.256 --> 37:55.393
Perhaps you'll need our services in the future.

37:55.393 --> 37:57.021
Perhaps.

38:15.195 --> 38:18.098
I'll miss the pleasure of your company.

38:18.098 --> 38:19.705
We should go, Degra.

38:19.705 --> 38:22.585
We're behind schedule already.

38:22.585 --> 38:24.789
We've invested a great deal in this project.

38:24.789 --> 38:26.908
And you've been well-paid for it.

38:26.908 --> 38:28.960
Yes. You've been more than generous,

38:28.960 --> 38:31.702
but I'd appreciate if you could tell me

38:31.702 --> 38:35.699
what this shipment is being used for.

38:41.287 --> 38:43.067
I don't think it's an unreasonable request.

38:43.067 --> 38:44.516
It doesn't concern you.

38:44.516 --> 38:47.837
It concerns all of us.

38:47.837 --> 38:51.203
We've learned there's a threat to our people.

38:51.203 --> 38:53.318
What kind of threat?

38:53.318 --> 38:55.702
A ruthless alien species.

38:55.702 --> 38:59.417
If we don't act, they'll destroy us.

39:08.809 --> 39:10.838
I'm glad we could contribute.

39:10.838 --> 39:13.845
Take pride in what you've done here.

39:26.695 --> 39:31.202
- Archer to Enterprise.
- Go ahead.

39:31.202 --> 39:33.345
What's the status of that Xindi ship?

39:33.345 --> 39:35.761
They broke orbit five minutes ago, Captain.

39:35.761 --> 39:37.789
Are you picking up the tracking signal?

39:37.789 --> 39:39.006
Loud and clear.

39:39.006 --> 39:40.246
Keep an eye on it.

39:40.246 --> 39:42.201
We'll be back as soon as we can.

39:42.201 --> 39:44.467
Acknowledged.

39:53.008 --> 39:55.488
Thank you.

39:57.554 --> 40:00.497
Is something wrong?

40:04.722 --> 40:12.186
I may have just betrayed my people to a ruthless alien species.

40:12.186 --> 40:15.708
I promise you, you haven't.

40:15.708 --> 40:18.074
Please trust me.

40:20.175 --> 40:22.116
To trust.

40:28.252 --> 40:34.171
Eventually, Degra's going to discover that you sabotaged his kemocite.

40:34.171 --> 40:36.553
It should delay their progress considerably.

40:36.553 --> 40:38.970
- They'll come back here.
- Don't worry.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.291
I can deal with Degra and his friends.

40:41.291 --> 40:44.970
You should just be concerned with finding this weapon.

40:46.942 --> 40:51.819
Their ship entered an energy portal after it left orbit.

40:51.819 --> 40:53.905
We've lost our tracking signal.

40:53.905 --> 40:56.505
The portal's range is only a few light-years.

40:56.505 --> 40:58.906
Keep searching.

41:03.757 --> 41:05.833
I better get back to Enterprise.

41:07.522 --> 41:14.148
If everything you've told me is true about the attack on your world,

41:14.148 --> 41:19.803
I hope you remember that all Xindi are not your enemy.

41:19.803 --> 41:21.786
I will.
