WEBVTT

00:05.092 --> 00:06.571
<i>Previously on "New Amsterdam"...</i>

00:13.535 --> 00:15.798
I'ma need you to come in
to New Amsterdam tomorrow

00:15.841 --> 00:18.148
so we can come up
with a plan for treatment.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.628
I don't wanna do any of that.

00:19.671 --> 00:23.414
I got a condition.
I gotta make some calls!

00:24.285 --> 00:27.331
Three years sober.
Wow, that's impressive.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.681
And the real villain
of your life is Mom.

00:29.725 --> 00:30.900
It's not me.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.075
Where are you going?

00:32.119 --> 00:33.729
To get high.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.513
Well, if that's really true,

00:35.557 --> 00:38.647
then...

00:38.690 --> 00:39.909
what are we doing?

00:39.952 --> 00:41.345
I don't know.

00:41.389 --> 00:45.697
I can't be
who I want to be...

00:45.741 --> 00:47.743
with you.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.317
The key to our appreciation
is looking deeply

00:56.360 --> 00:58.449
and asking yourself...

00:59.929 --> 01:02.845
How does it make you feel?

01:02.888 --> 01:04.107
Hmm?

01:04.151 --> 01:06.109
Uh, yeah...

01:09.069 --> 01:10.983
No, nothing.

01:11.027 --> 01:12.289
Tell me about it.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.638
I've been on three of these,

01:13.682 --> 01:14.813
and I haven't
hooked up anyone.

01:14.857 --> 01:17.860
No, I'm not here
looking for a date.

01:17.903 --> 01:22.560
I'm--no, I'm here--I wanna
broaden my horizons, you know?

01:22.604 --> 01:24.432
Find out what I like,
what I don't like,

01:24.475 --> 01:25.911
what I connect with,
where I belong.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.261
- Shh!
- I--

01:30.829 --> 01:33.615
Or I blew up
my entire life for no reason.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.192
Look, you won't return

02:29.236 --> 02:30.193
I don't even know
where you're staying.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.194
Can you just let me know

02:31.238 --> 02:32.500
that you're not dead?

02:34.893 --> 02:36.156
Oh... ha ha ha.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.635
Casey.

02:37.679 --> 02:39.289
Ho-ho-ho!

02:39.333 --> 02:41.248
- You're glowing.
- 8,000 feet up,

02:41.291 --> 02:42.510
closer to the sun.
- I'm dying to see

02:42.553 --> 02:43.902
Machu Picchu.
- Oh, totally worth

02:43.946 --> 02:45.643
the shin splints,
even the finger flint.

02:45.687 --> 02:47.428
How many Pisco Sours
did you have?

02:47.471 --> 02:49.169
A lot.

02:49.212 --> 02:52.389
Well, well, well, look who
deigned us with his presence.

02:52.433 --> 02:53.825
I'm sorry for whatever

02:53.869 --> 02:55.000
Bloom's been putting
you through.

02:55.044 --> 02:56.872
All right, all right,
that's enough.

02:56.915 --> 02:58.178
Back to work.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.223
He's not a member
of the Royal family,

03:00.267 --> 03:01.659
and this isn't a red carpet.

03:01.703 --> 03:03.313
- You miss me?
- Bay four.

03:03.357 --> 03:06.229
Oh, so you gonna play it
like this?

03:06.273 --> 03:07.317
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.711
Just say the words.

03:09.754 --> 03:10.929
You missed me.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.627
I didn't even realize
you were gone.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.672
And yet you happened
to pick up bagels

03:14.716 --> 03:16.631
from my favorite bagel place.

03:16.674 --> 03:19.242
Coincidence.
Attention, everyone--

03:19.286 --> 03:23.812
these Monty's Bagels are not
in honor of Casey's big return.

03:23.855 --> 03:25.814
They're just any other day
bagels that I happened

03:25.857 --> 03:28.077
to pick up for no particular
reason whatsoever.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.340
Just get 'em while they're hot.

03:30.384 --> 03:32.037
Just admit you missed me.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.865
Come on.
- Never.

03:39.001 --> 03:41.351
See?

03:41.395 --> 03:42.787

No--

04:49.637 --> 04:52.509
Call an ambulance.
Don't move, don't move.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.297
We're doctors.
We got you.

04:59.908 --> 05:00.996
You'll be okay.

05:07.089 --> 05:09.570
Client coming through!

05:09.613 --> 05:11.572
Ma'am, I can see
that you have suffered

05:11.615 --> 05:12.921
a terrible calamity!

05:12.964 --> 05:16.359
I only hope that you get
the proper compensation--

05:16.403 --> 05:17.491
Excuse me.
There's no soliciting

05:17.534 --> 05:18.883
on hospital property,
all right?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.407
I still have ten feet
of public property.

05:20.450 --> 05:21.451
These people
were almost killed.

05:21.495 --> 05:22.931
They're in shock.
They're in pain.

05:22.974 --> 05:25.499
The last thing they need
is some two-bit sleazy lawyer

05:25.542 --> 05:27.544
preying on them.
- Yeah, sleazy two-bit lawyer

05:27.588 --> 05:28.980
who specializes

05:29.024 --> 05:31.331
in that exact intersection
that's a death trap.

05:31.374 --> 05:34.246
"Callie
'Get Yo' Crash Cash' Cruz"?

05:34.290 --> 05:36.031
- How can I help?
- Don't say that.

05:36.074 --> 05:38.729
Doc, listen.
We're on the same side,

05:38.773 --> 05:41.819
and you never know when you
have to Cruz for justice!

05:41.863 --> 05:42.864
Thank you.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.530
Does that hurt?
- A little.

05:56.573 --> 05:57.661
Hey, you paged?

05:57.705 --> 05:58.836
Uh, Rafael here thought

05:58.880 --> 06:00.360
he could take down
a speeding car.

06:00.403 --> 06:01.752
Tough odds, kid.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.058
No bleeding,
so bone didn't break the skin.

06:03.101 --> 06:04.625
But I am still worried
about a fracture.

06:04.668 --> 06:06.453
Okay, no problem.
We'll X-ray to confirm.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.977
But, uh, looks like you
definitely will need

06:09.020 --> 06:10.021
a cast for that arm.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.849
No, I can't do that.

06:11.893 --> 06:13.851
Liza Stinson's
pool party's this weekend.

06:13.895 --> 06:16.767
I can't be the loser that
doesn't go in the water.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.160
- Oh...
- Doctor, is there anyone

06:18.203 --> 06:20.858
in the hospital suffering
as much as poor Rafael?

06:20.902 --> 06:23.383
- Grandma...
- "Oh, no, this is the worst

06:23.426 --> 06:25.210
I've ever seen."
- Hey.

06:25.254 --> 06:27.430
Well, you'll still get to
stick your legs in the pool.

06:27.474 --> 06:29.867
- It's not the same.
- Ah...[chuckles].

06:29.911 --> 06:31.695
All right, well,
let's get you up.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.131
We can wait
for Rafael upstairs.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.004
Ah--aah!

06:36.047 --> 06:38.441
- Let's get her down.
- Grandma? What's going on?

06:38.485 --> 06:39.877
Is she okay?
- Let's get her right here.

06:39.921 --> 06:40.791
Ah--

06:40.835 --> 06:42.271
Let's get her to Trauma One.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.061
Come on, sweetie.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.762
No!

06:54.805 --> 06:56.198
Hey, bud...

06:56.241 --> 06:57.678
- Do the big breaths.
- Let's do the thing.

06:57.721 --> 06:59.462
Baby, look at me.
Listen to me.

06:59.506 --> 07:00.724
Baby, look at my mouth.
Look at my mouth.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.291
Remember?

07:02.334 --> 07:03.553
Remember? Do that.

07:03.597 --> 07:05.555
Hi, sorry, Doc.
- Hi.

07:05.599 --> 07:07.557
- Uh, Josh and Chary, Jael.
- Hi.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.124
This is why we're here.

07:09.167 --> 07:11.126
That's okay.
This is why I'm here.

07:11.169 --> 07:12.475
No!

07:12.519 --> 07:14.216
Uh, Jael was
a perfectly happy baby

07:14.259 --> 07:16.000
until about two years ago,
and then...

07:16.044 --> 07:18.394
it just keeps getting worse
every year.

07:19.656 --> 07:20.918
We know--baby, shh.
Hey, it's okay.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.485
Ever since starting school,

07:22.529 --> 07:24.008
he's been spiraling
out of control.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.923
- Well, have you tried...
- Yeah, no, no.

07:25.967 --> 07:27.838
Look, Doc,
we've tried everything--

07:27.882 --> 07:30.580
more sleep, less sleep,
no sugar,

07:30.624 --> 07:32.582
uh, no... food coloring.

07:32.626 --> 07:35.193
- The-the--what--
- Uh, uh, the calming jars.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.891
Yeah, the calming jars.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.936
We didn't wanna medicate him
till absolutely necessary.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.460
Right.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.506
It's clear to us
that he needs it.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.769
Okay, okay.
Hi, hi.

07:45.813 --> 07:47.945
Hi.
Would you like a chair?

07:47.989 --> 07:49.512
Hold on a second.
Honey, honey, look.

07:49.556 --> 07:50.992
You gotta look at his mouth, okay?

07:51.035 --> 07:52.950
No, baby, no.
You gotta--

07:52.994 --> 07:55.866
Can you do that again?
He needs to see your lips.

07:55.910 --> 07:58.608
Jael's deaf?
I'm so sorry, my apologies.

07:58.652 --> 08:00.654
I don't know how I missed that
on his chart.

08:00.697 --> 08:02.612
Uh, you didn't.

08:02.656 --> 08:03.961
We don't usually mention it

08:04.005 --> 08:05.615
so he's not treated
any differently.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.965
I see, okay.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.837
But wouldn't you like
an ASL interpreter here,

08:09.880 --> 08:11.882
at least, so that Jael
feels more comfortable

08:11.926 --> 08:14.494
communicating with me?
- No, it won't be necessary.

08:14.537 --> 08:17.322
Jael doesn't know ASL.

08:26.680 --> 08:28.333
Hey, Doc!

08:28.377 --> 08:29.509
Doc!

08:30.510 --> 08:31.815
Come here!

08:31.859 --> 08:33.643
Step into my office.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.471
Hey.
I would tell you to sit,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.038
but I've only
got this one chair,

08:37.081 --> 08:41.738
and I've got this whole
lumbar situation, and...

08:41.782 --> 08:43.740
anyway, what can I do for you?

08:43.784 --> 08:46.264
Well, uh,
this is a very nice office.

08:46.308 --> 08:49.659
You don't need walls
or electricity or law stuff.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.313
So you're here
to bring justice

08:51.356 --> 08:53.968
to the kid and the old broad
who got mushed this morning?

08:54.011 --> 08:56.231
Yeah,
I wouldn't call her that.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.146
But, um, yeah.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.452
And more people are going to
get hurt unless we fix it.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.585
Put your mind at ease.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.108
Be calm.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.588
Come with me.

09:05.632 --> 09:09.331
Now, you see
that crosswalk over there?

09:11.638 --> 09:13.422
- No.
- Because there isn't one.

09:13.465 --> 09:18.166
My point is that intersection
is not up to code,

09:18.209 --> 09:20.864
and the city has never
done squat to fix it.

09:20.908 --> 09:23.780
But at the end of the day,
that is not an intersection.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.174
That is a slot machine.

09:26.217 --> 09:30.047
And if your old broad
needs surgery, well then,

09:30.091 --> 09:33.573
that slot machine
is set at all sevens.

09:33.616 --> 09:36.750
I'm talking big payouts!
A lot of cash!

09:36.793 --> 09:40.275
Get your crash cash, baby!
Get your crash cash!

09:40.318 --> 09:43.931
I-I'm actually
not looking for money.

09:43.974 --> 09:47.108
An obvious lie, but okay.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.718
No, no, no.
All I am here for--

09:48.762 --> 09:49.980
- Mm-hmm.
- Is to get this intersection

09:50.024 --> 09:51.765
fixed, all right?
That's it.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.897
Well, you cannot
sue a driver to get that.

09:53.941 --> 09:56.291
Well, we're not
gonna sue a driver.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.858
We're gonna sue
the city of New York.

09:59.816 --> 10:02.253
10 grand up front,
and that's a discount.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.865
5, and only if we win.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.737
Let's go crush
these bastards.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.787
Obviously, the city
of New York takes no joy

10:13.830 --> 10:15.745
in what happened
to Ana and Rafael Linares.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.747
But I must point out
that in this courtroom,

10:17.791 --> 10:20.663
we have neither the perpetrator
of a crime nor a victim.

10:20.707 --> 10:22.796
Where is the driver
of this car?

10:22.839 --> 10:25.233
Where are the people
who were struck?

10:25.276 --> 10:28.149
This is an irrelevant bystander
smelling deep pockets,

10:28.192 --> 10:30.586
and the City moves for this
complaint to be dismissed.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.762
Response, Counselor?

10:32.806 --> 10:35.504
Time to make 'em hurt
where the sun don't shine.

10:35.547 --> 10:37.114
Yeah, um, Your Honor,

10:37.158 --> 10:39.551
this crosswalk is in a very
busy residential neighborhood.

10:39.595 --> 10:42.337
Kids play there.
Families work there.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.078
In fact, their hopes and dreams

10:44.121 --> 10:47.429
are played out on this
neglected patch of asphalt.

10:47.472 --> 10:49.736
And I'm not asking for money, okay?

10:49.779 --> 10:51.694
All I'm asking is
for the city of New York

10:51.738 --> 10:54.610
to protect the lives of its
citizens--

10:54.654 --> 10:56.046
which I believe
they are obligated to do--

10:56.090 --> 10:59.093
and offer the cost
of a new coat of paint.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.791
Now, I believe
that is a small price to pay

11:01.835 --> 11:04.794
to protect the lives of
the citizens of this shining--

11:04.838 --> 11:06.056
Citation?

11:06.100 --> 11:07.101
Objection.

11:07.144 --> 11:09.451
Sorry.
Uh, what?

11:09.494 --> 11:10.626
What city charter regulation

11:10.670 --> 11:12.672
are you citing
for your complaint?

11:14.717 --> 11:16.240
Well...

11:16.284 --> 11:18.286
Yarborough v.
City of New York.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.722
That's the one.

11:19.766 --> 11:22.725
With exception
of unsightly construction,

11:22.769 --> 11:26.120
the City is required
to paint the intersection.

11:26.163 --> 11:28.035
So ordered.
Department of Transportation

11:28.078 --> 11:29.558
will restore the intersection.

11:30.733 --> 11:31.691
The--what the--um--

11:31.734 --> 11:33.605
- We just--did we win?
- We won.

11:33.649 --> 11:38.175
And that, my friend,
is how you Cruz for justice!

11:38.219 --> 11:40.308
God, I'm good.

11:40.351 --> 11:43.441
Wow, I can't believe we won.

11:43.485 --> 11:46.793
I mean, I can't believe that
you actually, you know, did it.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.056
I had some doubts about you--
maybe you noticed.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.058
But that was incredible.
I mean, you knew exactly

11:51.101 --> 11:54.278
what to say,
and this feels so good!

11:54.322 --> 11:55.453
I think
I should've been a lawyer.

11:55.497 --> 11:56.933
Yeah, I know, right?

11:56.977 --> 11:58.935
Now imagine
how even better you'd feel

11:58.979 --> 12:01.503
if they were actually
gonna paint that thing.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.027
Yeah, but the judge
just said they have to.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.986
So they're going to...

12:06.029 --> 12:07.814
This is actually
the third time

12:07.857 --> 12:09.946
I've won a city case
about that intersection,

12:09.990 --> 12:11.469
and they ain't
never painted it yet.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.733
That'll be 5 grand.

12:34.405 --> 12:35.537
You doing okay?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.321
- Yeah, fine.
- Yeah?

12:37.365 --> 12:39.497
- Yeah.
- Hmm.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.500
That's the fourth time you came
in here to check on your phone.

12:42.544 --> 12:45.025
Are you spying on me?

12:45.068 --> 12:47.375
Well, I've known you
long enough to know

12:47.418 --> 12:48.593
when you're upset.

12:48.637 --> 12:49.812
I'm fine, Casey.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.683
Ah, she says as she evades.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.076
She says while working,

12:53.120 --> 12:55.296
which is what you
should be doing too.

12:55.339 --> 12:59.039
Oh, and, um, I'm sorry
to bruise your sensitive ego,

12:59.082 --> 13:02.085
but I had things totally under
control while you were gone.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.043
Oh.

13:03.086 --> 13:04.218
Kai.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.437
Kai, you okay?

13:06.481 --> 13:07.830
I don't feel so--

13:07.874 --> 13:10.659
Okay, okay.
Let's get you sat down.

13:10.702 --> 13:12.226
Here you go.

13:12.269 --> 13:14.141
Oh, my God.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.404
Can you take Bay two?

13:16.447 --> 13:18.885
Uh, Casey,
can you go see if the--

13:18.928 --> 13:22.279
- I gotta go.
- No...

13:22.323 --> 13:23.411
There you go.

13:23.454 --> 13:24.629
Now, let me know
if your fingers go numb.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.892
All right.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.373
Is that about my grandma?

13:29.417 --> 13:30.592
No.

13:32.289 --> 13:33.856
Is Nana okay?

13:35.423 --> 13:36.772
"Your grandmother's injuries

13:36.816 --> 13:38.861
"were more severe
than we expected.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.082
"She cracked
one of the vertebrae

13:42.125 --> 13:43.387
in her spinal column."

13:43.431 --> 13:45.041
Oh.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.784
She's gonna be fine though, right?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.307
I mean, you guys saw her.
She was walking.

13:50.351 --> 13:51.961
She's gonna be fine.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.486
"Well, at her age,
it's dangerous.

13:55.530 --> 14:00.361
"But the good news
is that we can treat it.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.972
"First option is minimally
invasive, but it means

14:03.016 --> 14:05.757
"your grandmother
wears a back brace

14:05.801 --> 14:07.847
"for the rest of her life.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.720
"Second option
is open spinal surgery.

14:11.763 --> 14:14.288
It does offer greater upside,
but it's risky."

14:14.331 --> 14:17.160
Okay, um, which one
is she gonna choose?

14:21.686 --> 14:23.210
"Your grandmother
is unconscious.

14:23.253 --> 14:26.517
"So it's up to her
healthcare proxy to choose.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.565
That's you, Rafael."

14:30.608 --> 14:31.783
Me?

14:31.827 --> 14:34.090
"It's in her medical records.

14:34.134 --> 14:36.963
She chose you to make
these decisions for her."

14:37.006 --> 14:38.312
What?

14:42.011 --> 14:43.404
What if I make
the wrong decision?

14:43.447 --> 14:46.146
I--no, no.
You choose.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.061
We can't.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.891
Your grandmother trusted you
enough to make you her proxy.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.675
And now you just gotta
trust yourself enough

14:53.718 --> 14:56.156
to make a decision.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.209
Um...

15:07.602 --> 15:08.777
I say...

15:10.605 --> 15:13.216
I say do the surgery.

15:38.111 --> 15:42.202
At 12 months,
Jael was just starting to talk

15:42.245 --> 15:44.595
when he got sick,

15:44.639 --> 15:48.643
and then he lost his hearing.

15:48.686 --> 15:50.862
And...

15:50.906 --> 15:53.822
we assumed that he needed
to learn ASL, but--

15:53.865 --> 15:56.694
His pediatrician told us
it wasn't necessary--

15:56.738 --> 15:59.959
that if we taught him to sign,
he would never learn to speak.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.092
He would rely on sign language
instead of reading lips.

16:05.355 --> 16:08.010
The audiologist
and the speech therapist,

16:08.054 --> 16:10.056
they told us the same thing.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.927
If we wanted
to give him his best shot

16:11.971 --> 16:14.625
at navigating the world,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.105
we had to motivate him.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.803
His doctors said

16:18.847 --> 16:21.458
that sign language
would limit him.

16:21.502 --> 16:24.200
It would shrink his world
to a small bubble of peers

16:24.244 --> 16:25.767
who could sign.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.421
It would isolate him.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.076
We didn't wanna relegate
our son to some dark corner

16:30.119 --> 16:32.730
to be treated
like a second class citizen.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.907
Well, is it working?

16:37.213 --> 16:40.260
The therapy, the exercises,
are they working?

16:45.613 --> 16:47.136
Can you hold
a conversation with him?

16:49.008 --> 16:53.012
How many words
is he able to speak?

16:54.317 --> 16:55.927
78.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.020
Okay.
That's, um...

17:02.978 --> 17:04.458
The average
that a two-year-old knows

17:04.501 --> 17:08.027
is around 150,
just to put it in perspective.

17:08.070 --> 17:12.074
The behavior that Jael
is showing is consistent

17:12.118 --> 17:14.337
with language
deprivation syndrome.

17:14.381 --> 17:18.124
The brain has a critical window
in which it forms language,

17:18.167 --> 17:21.127
and if that window is missed,
it can cause a whole range

17:21.170 --> 17:23.303
of issues.
Some are behavioral,

17:23.346 --> 17:26.262
some mental.
If that window is closed,

17:26.306 --> 17:29.352
it makes acquiring language
much more difficult.

17:31.528 --> 17:35.010
If this is true, how come no
one's ever told us this before?

17:35.054 --> 17:39.710
Because unfortunately,
medicine--our world--

17:39.754 --> 17:41.147
is still very much filtered

17:41.190 --> 17:43.671
through an able-bodied
perspective.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.021
That's why.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.372
You two need
to make a decision--now.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.767
To give Jael
a language of his own,

17:52.810 --> 17:54.856
even if it's one
that you don't understand,

17:54.899 --> 18:01.210
because his window is closing.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.139
If you're willing
to get your hands dirty

18:17.183 --> 18:18.184
to get that intersection fixed,

18:18.227 --> 18:19.837
this is where
the magic happens.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.709
Great, and by magic, do you
mean making bodies disappear?

18:21.752 --> 18:24.146
Oh, give me your phone.
I gotta send a text.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.714
- My phone?
- Yeah, things are just louder

18:26.757 --> 18:29.412
when they come
from an unknown number.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.197
You know what?
I'm not gonna ask questions.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.502
- Good.
- Great.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.677
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

18:38.552 --> 18:39.857
Curt!

18:39.901 --> 18:41.294
Callie!
You crazy bitch.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.339
You scared the crap out of me.

18:43.383 --> 18:44.601
Mwah!
Come here.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.213
C-c-c-c-come.
Hey, Dr. Max Goodwin.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.259
This is Curt Waldichuck,
Deputy Commissioner

18:50.303 --> 18:52.218
for Roadway Repair
and Maintenance

18:52.261 --> 18:53.523
for the city of New York.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.525
Great.
Well, I'll just assume

18:55.569 --> 18:57.919
this is a totally normal
and professional way to meet

18:57.962 --> 18:59.529
and dive right in.
- Sure.

18:59.573 --> 19:04.186
So we received a judicial
order to have your department

19:04.230 --> 19:06.797
repaint an intersection--
very dangerous.

19:06.841 --> 19:09.496
So I guess we're here,
because we wanna know

19:09.539 --> 19:12.934
what we have to do
to actually make that happen.

19:12.977 --> 19:14.370
Nothin'.

19:14.414 --> 19:16.981
Judge's order puts it
right onto our action list.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.374
We'll get to it ASAP.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.898
ASAP.
Curt.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.162
Oh, you beautiful weasel, you.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.076
We both know
that's gonna take decades

19:25.120 --> 19:27.253
to get
to my client's intersection.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.343
Unless, of course,
some friendly encouragement

19:30.386 --> 19:33.694
might bump my client sort of
to the top of the list.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.348
- I'm listenin'.
- Yeah, I'm also listening.

19:35.391 --> 19:36.871
Sounds like--hey, hi.

19:36.914 --> 19:39.047
Sounds like you were asking us
to bribe a city official?

19:39.090 --> 19:40.570
Whoa.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.311
Bribery, Doc?

19:42.355 --> 19:43.269
No way.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.879
For--God, no.

19:44.922 --> 19:48.404
I'm just reminding my ferrety
friend of a little dalliance

19:48.448 --> 19:50.319
he enjoyed
with a lady of the night.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.800
- Oh, you wouldn't dare.
- That's not bribery.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.149
That's extortion.
- Oh, but you'd be surprised

19:54.193 --> 19:55.324
how well it works.
- You think

19:55.368 --> 19:57.283
I don't got the goods on you,
Callie?

19:57.326 --> 19:58.719
- All right, hey--
- What do ya got?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.242
Why don't we just all
just take it down a notch,

20:00.286 --> 20:01.504
all right?
Your consensual sex life

20:01.548 --> 20:03.550
is, uh, you know,
your business,

20:03.593 --> 20:05.856
and I'm sure it's going great.
I think we should go.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.118
Whoa, whoa, one second.

20:07.162 --> 20:09.077
W-w-wait, Doctor, wait.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.384
You are walking away
from a win.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.516
Do you want
the intersection fixed or not?

20:13.560 --> 20:15.388
Not like this.
I'm not gonna bribe

20:15.431 --> 20:17.564
a city official just
to get them to do their job,

20:17.607 --> 20:19.696
all right?
I'd rather do things my way.

20:19.740 --> 20:23.004
Next time, money up front.
Let's go.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.484
Yeah.

20:33.928 --> 20:37.540
Guys, uh, tests came back--

20:37.584 --> 20:38.715
Bacillus Cereus.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.284
Which means it's my fault.

20:42.328 --> 20:43.938
I guess
it must've been the schmear.

20:43.981 --> 20:47.289
Are you trying to off us?
Is that what happened to Leyla?

20:47.333 --> 20:50.205
Leyla got a better job
at Baptist.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.294
But thank you
for bringing that up.

20:52.338 --> 20:53.556
I guess the cream cheese

20:53.600 --> 20:55.036
must've been left out
for too long.

20:55.079 --> 20:56.559
Then why aren't you sick?

20:56.603 --> 20:58.474
Oh, I had
the vegan cream cheese.

20:58.518 --> 21:01.216
- What about Walsh?
- I also ate the vegan one--

21:01.260 --> 21:03.436
by accident--
nearly made me throw up

21:03.479 --> 21:04.915
for an entirely
different reason.

21:04.959 --> 21:07.440
35-year-old ice cream vendor.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.616
His stand got rear ended.
- Aaah!

21:09.659 --> 21:12.445
- And this is?
- How they serve the ice cream.

21:12.488 --> 21:15.274
- It's my tricking stick.
- He's hypotensive and tachy.

21:15.317 --> 21:16.275
All right,
let's get him to Trauma One.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.754
Let's go.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.234
BP's dropping.
Heart rate's slow.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.583
FAST is negative.

21:20.627 --> 21:22.324
This thing is tickling
his vagus nerve.

21:22.368 --> 21:23.543
Okay,
we gotta get it out of him.

21:23.586 --> 21:25.109
He's lost a ton of blood.

21:25.153 --> 21:26.850
Okay,
let's clear the puncture.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.506
Easy...

21:30.550 --> 21:32.247
Oh...

21:32.291 --> 21:34.118
Easy, come on.
- I can see why they call it

21:34.162 --> 21:35.816
a tricking stick.

21:35.859 --> 21:37.470
Okay.
Lap pad.

21:39.863 --> 21:41.778
Suction.
- Got it.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.869
- He's crashing.
- Okay, let's push fluids.

21:45.913 --> 21:47.349
I'm gonna try
and suture him up right here.

21:48.829 --> 21:50.787
Inject epi!

21:50.831 --> 21:52.093
You want some help?

21:52.136 --> 21:53.964
Just get back to your bay!

21:54.008 --> 21:55.139
What?
I've got this.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.974
Can someone
please silence that?

22:04.018 --> 22:05.585
It's your sister.

22:05.628 --> 22:07.369
Why is your drugged-out
sister calling you?

22:07.413 --> 22:09.197
Can you just
get back to your bay?

22:09.240 --> 22:10.851
Let's hang a bag of O-Neg!

22:35.789 --> 22:39.401
Hey, buddy.

22:59.465 --> 23:01.336
Can you read my lips?

23:02.859 --> 23:04.426
Are you hungry?

23:06.167 --> 23:07.951
You hungry?

23:10.954 --> 23:12.042
Yeah?

23:14.610 --> 23:16.743
I'll get you a burger.

23:18.962 --> 23:20.442
Hang on.

23:25.447 --> 23:26.622
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:26.666 --> 23:28.972
Okay, the kid likes burgers.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.670
Get right on that.

23:31.888 --> 23:35.588
Hey, Jael, do you
wanna learn a funny sign?

23:36.502 --> 23:38.939
Yeah?
Kay, ready?

23:38.982 --> 23:40.070
Burger King.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.639
Booger.

23:47.469 --> 23:48.557
Booger.

23:49.993 --> 23:51.342
King.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.518
Yup.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.345
Yeah.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.347
You're the booger king?

23:56.391 --> 23:58.567
You're the--
I'm the booger king?

23:58.611 --> 23:59.699
Mm-hmm, all right.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.788
Good to be the king
of something.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.791
Oh, boy, I can't imagine
how hard the last few years

24:04.834 --> 24:08.795
have been with everybody
wearing a mask

24:08.838 --> 24:10.666
all the time.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.495
And you're not understanding
the language the entire world

24:13.539 --> 24:14.757
was speaking.

24:14.801 --> 24:17.499
Would you like
to learn sign language?

24:19.240 --> 24:20.546
Sign language?

24:31.382 --> 24:32.993
Can I show you something?

24:34.995 --> 24:36.387
Wanna come with me?

24:37.563 --> 24:39.303
Yeah?
Kay, come on.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.653
Let's go.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.959
Yeah, yeah, come on.
Come with me.

24:43.003 --> 24:44.439
You too, Mom and Dad.
Come on, let's go.

24:44.483 --> 24:45.788
Field trip.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.535
- How's she doing?
- Vitals are stable.

24:53.579 --> 24:55.058
That's Dr. Wilder.

24:55.102 --> 24:58.192
She is the chair
of this entire department.

24:58.235 --> 24:59.759
She's our top oncologist.

24:59.802 --> 25:02.544
She runs this whole thing.
And guess what.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.459
She's deaf--

25:04.503 --> 25:06.548
like you.

25:06.592 --> 25:08.724
It's cool, right?

25:10.073 --> 25:13.555
Yeah, sign language is a key
that unlocked the world.

25:17.254 --> 25:18.734
<i>Suction.</i>

25:21.345 --> 25:23.434
<i>- Alice.
- Vitals are stable.</i>

25:50.070 --> 25:51.898
- What, Dad. <i>
- You're busy.</i>

25:51.941 --> 25:53.116
<i>I get it.</i>

25:53.160 --> 25:55.466
<i>Dr. Reynolds!
You're a man on the go.</i>

25:57.904 --> 26:00.210
- Where are you calling from? <i>
- I'm a man on the go too.</i>

26:00.254 --> 26:03.170
<i>I'm making moves myself.
But I need 100 bucks.</i>

26:03.213 --> 26:04.475
For what?

26:04.519 --> 26:06.739
<i>Before you say no,
hear a brother out.</i>

26:06.782 --> 26:08.871
I'm making--I've got--

26:08.915 --> 26:11.134
Pops, where are you?

26:11.178 --> 26:12.440
Get out of my way!

26:12.483 --> 26:14.050
You get out of my way,
old man!

26:14.094 --> 26:16.487
- Why are you in the street?
- You get outta my way!

26:16.531 --> 26:18.489
Go! Go! <i>
- Are you in the street?</i>

26:18.533 --> 26:19.621
<i>I got--I got plans.</i>

26:19.665 --> 26:21.710
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>

26:21.754 --> 26:24.583
I'm working it.
I got everything under control.

26:24.626 --> 26:27.063
<i>What's going on?</i>

26:27.107 --> 26:28.499
Pops?
Pops!

26:31.285 --> 26:32.939
Hi, excuse me.
How's it going?

26:32.982 --> 26:34.593
Just a second of your time.

26:34.636 --> 26:37.639
How would you feel about
saving some children's lives?

26:37.683 --> 26:39.641
Sorry, bud.
Don't got any cash.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.600
Oh, no, no.
It's not that kind of donation.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.776
See, there is a dangerous
intersection nearby.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.821
I see a lot of people
get hurt there,

26:45.865 --> 26:47.954
and how would you feel about

26:47.997 --> 26:51.740
stopping by after your shift
and touching it up?

26:51.784 --> 26:54.395
I mean,
you'd be improving the city,

26:54.438 --> 26:55.701
and you'd be
keeping people safe,

26:55.744 --> 26:58.355
and all it's gonna cost you
is some paint.

26:58.399 --> 26:59.487
So...
- So...

26:59.530 --> 27:00.880
both: Right?
- What do you say?

27:00.923 --> 27:02.664
- We'd love to.
- Great!

27:02.708 --> 27:04.361
I knew it! Finally.

27:04.405 --> 27:05.928
Thank you.
- We can't, though.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.364
Can't--can't?

27:07.408 --> 27:09.105
Why?
- We don't just paint

27:09.149 --> 27:11.194
wherever the hell.
We got a schedule.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.587
Yeah, see?
There's a schedule.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.241
The city inventories
every gallon of paint.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.764
Yeah, 'cause it's the city.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.419
Plus, our boss flips out
if we aren't on his schedule

27:18.462 --> 27:21.465
to a T, so sorry, guy.
- Um, yeah.

27:21.509 --> 27:23.816
But I'm actually a boss myself.
So maybe, you know--

27:23.859 --> 27:25.731
- Yeah, but Max, we gotta--
- Right, but maybe

27:25.774 --> 27:27.428
just one bucket--
- We gotta move on.

27:27.471 --> 27:29.430
- Couple blocks.
- Gotta move on, okay?

27:29.473 --> 27:31.301
You tried, all right?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.521
You took a few swings,
and you missed a few balls.

27:33.564 --> 27:37.177
But you played the game.
Now, now it's time to move on.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.787
It's unbelievable.
You know, my friend

27:38.831 --> 27:40.441
could've died this morning--

27:40.484 --> 27:44.401
or Rafael or his grandmother
or my daughter could be playing

27:44.445 --> 27:46.577
by a street, and all it would
take is one speeding car

27:46.621 --> 27:48.101
to see her one second too late.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.842
You're gonna
have an aneurism.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.495
People are getting hurt!

27:51.539 --> 27:54.890
And it would be so easy
to just fix it.

27:54.934 --> 27:58.111
And all anyone keeps telling me
is why they can't.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.809
Can we just get something done?

28:01.854 --> 28:04.378
How can running the largest
public hospital in America

28:04.421 --> 28:07.642
be easier than just
fixing an intersection?

28:08.817 --> 28:11.472
I'm gonna Venmo your 5 grand,
all right?

28:11.515 --> 28:13.735
And thanks for your help.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.135
"Stabilization complete.

28:22.178 --> 28:25.660
"Let's lighten the anesthesia
and see if there's any damage

28:25.704 --> 28:27.967
to the spinal cord."
- Lightening.

28:28.010 --> 28:30.665
"Ana, if you can hear me,

28:30.709 --> 28:33.450
raise your index finger
on your right hand."

28:38.107 --> 28:40.806
"Great, you're doing great."

28:45.506 --> 28:47.813
"Now wiggle your toes."

28:58.867 --> 29:01.348
"Ana, can you wiggle
your toes for me?"

29:11.053 --> 29:12.968
"You're doing great."

29:15.144 --> 29:17.668
So guys,
there is some good news.

29:17.712 --> 29:19.583
There is an emerging program

29:19.627 --> 29:22.108
that will help make up
for all the lost time.

29:22.151 --> 29:23.936
Jael will learn
ASL much quicker

29:23.979 --> 29:25.372
in an environment like this

29:25.415 --> 29:28.027
as opposed
to a mainstream school.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.376
Yeah, check it out.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.813
It's a high-quality
deaf education.

29:31.857 --> 29:35.382
They use a bilingual approach,
which means that Jael

29:35.425 --> 29:37.427
will continue
to receive speech therapy

29:37.471 --> 29:38.733
as well lip-reading instruction

29:38.777 --> 29:41.040
and all the while,
he'll be learning to sign

29:41.083 --> 29:44.304
while building up a very strong
foundation of language.

29:44.347 --> 29:47.524
This is amazing.
Where is it?

29:47.568 --> 29:50.919
The school itself is
in Framingham, Massachusetts.

29:50.963 --> 29:53.008
That's a four-hour drive.

29:53.052 --> 29:55.663
How many times a week
do we have to sign him up for?

29:55.706 --> 29:58.187
Because of how late it is
in his development,

29:58.231 --> 30:00.102
they recommend
that we enroll Jael

30:00.146 --> 30:01.669
in their residential program,

30:01.712 --> 30:03.149
which means
that he will be living there,

30:03.192 --> 30:06.848
fully immersed in the language.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.850
Oh, you just said
that he is acting out

30:08.894 --> 30:10.330
because he can't
communicate his needs,

30:10.373 --> 30:11.984
and now you want us
to send our five-year-old

30:12.027 --> 30:14.508
to live in another state
with strangers?

30:14.551 --> 30:16.466
- He'll be lost.
- Well, he's lost now.

30:16.510 --> 30:19.600
He's on his own now.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.915
Do you wanna go?

30:29.958 --> 30:32.265
Yeah.

30:32.308 --> 30:34.615
Go ahead.
Take a look around.

30:45.974 --> 30:47.671
Yeah.

30:56.028 --> 30:58.030
Walsh,
let's get him up to Post-Op.

30:58.073 --> 31:01.468
They can continue
to take care of him up there.

31:01.511 --> 31:05.037
Chart room, now.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.867
<i>Hospital maintenance
needed on 4-3.</i>

31:17.527 --> 31:19.442
Sent you a message.
Let's hear it.

31:19.486 --> 31:21.662
Would you just stop?
It's private.

31:21.705 --> 31:23.185
From a sister
you've been actively avoiding

31:23.229 --> 31:24.970
since I've known you?
- Yeah, what do you want me

31:25.013 --> 31:26.188
to say?

31:26.232 --> 31:27.711
What happened
when I was gone?

31:27.755 --> 31:29.278
I was lying earlier, okay?

31:29.322 --> 31:30.714
Yeah, no kidding.

31:30.758 --> 31:32.978
I missed the hell
out of you when you were gone.

31:33.021 --> 31:35.502
I mean, I turned to talk to
you, like, a million times.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.677
But you were
on top of a mountain

31:36.720 --> 31:38.461
where I couldn't even call you.

31:38.505 --> 31:40.246
You're my touchstone.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.336
You're my best friend,
and if you would've been here,

31:43.379 --> 31:46.208
I would never have been so
stupid as to try to save her.

31:46.252 --> 31:48.732
Does your sponsor know
that she's in your life again?

31:50.125 --> 31:51.866
She's my sister.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.782
Just tell me something.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.090
What part about putting the
oxygen mask on yourself first

31:58.133 --> 31:59.787
did you forget?

32:01.702 --> 32:05.488
She's like this
because of me.

32:05.532 --> 32:07.186
I can't just abandon her--

32:07.229 --> 32:08.839
again.

32:11.103 --> 32:12.104
I can't.

32:25.247 --> 32:26.727
You got the hundred?

32:26.770 --> 32:29.251
I walked the whole way,
so I hope you got it.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.558
Okay, um, you've been
drinking?

32:31.601 --> 32:33.734
Hell no.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.518
I just got a plan.
That's all.

32:35.562 --> 32:36.998
I'm gon' make
everything good again.

32:37.042 --> 32:38.739
You watch and see.

32:38.782 --> 32:41.916
I'm getting the garage back.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.048
Bam!

32:44.353 --> 32:45.441
Floyd's?

32:45.485 --> 32:47.748
With $100?
- Yes, sir.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.576
I should never have sold it.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.012
Everything was beautiful then.

32:51.056 --> 32:53.710
I had it all--
your mom, all you kids,

32:53.754 --> 32:55.234
my own shop.
- Yeah.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.713
- It was beautiful.
- Okay, yeah, I know.

32:56.757 --> 32:58.106
Let's go inside.
We can figure it out.

32:58.150 --> 33:01.022
Oh, no time.
Just give me the money, son!

33:01.066 --> 33:04.156
Pops,
you gotta let me help you.

33:04.199 --> 33:07.333
Help me?

33:08.987 --> 33:12.599
You can help me.
Just give me the hundred, son.

33:15.602 --> 33:16.951
I'ma get you help.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.606
It's a 51/50.
Just a temporary psych old.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.173
What's going on?

33:21.216 --> 33:23.131
This the 9.58?

33:23.175 --> 33:25.046
- What'd you do, son?
- Just take it easy, sir.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.353
- I--I'm your father.
- This is just temporary.

33:27.396 --> 33:28.789
You're my son!

33:28.832 --> 33:30.486
- Listen to 'em, Pops.
- Please, Floyd, please.

33:30.530 --> 33:31.618
Please, Floyd!
- Take it easy.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.359
Please, Floyd, please.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.752
Please, Floyd! Floyd!

33:35.796 --> 33:37.058
<i>Please, Floyd!</i>

34:00.864 --> 34:02.562
<i>Now that you ask me...</i>

34:02.605 --> 34:04.477
<i>I'm so high.
Pass it here.</i>

34:04.520 --> 34:06.218
<i>I want another bump.</i>

34:06.261 --> 34:08.742
<i>Stop hogging!
So greedy and selfish!</i>

34:08.785 --> 34:11.092
<i>I actually am not.
You're so wasted.</i>

34:11.136 --> 34:13.094
<i>You're just
literally babbling.</i>

34:13.138 --> 34:15.444
<i>I'm gonna get more vodka
from Leo's downstairs.</i>

34:48.260 --> 34:50.349
How you doin'?

34:52.960 --> 34:55.180
Don't beat yourself up.

34:55.223 --> 34:58.661
There's no way you could've
known it'd end up this way.

35:05.015 --> 35:08.236
She took care of me
when no one else did.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.978
And now...

35:11.021 --> 35:13.807
I don't know
how to take care of her.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.853
And it's all because
of that stupid decision.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.728
How did you
come to that decision?

35:24.557 --> 35:26.950
I didn't.
You forced me.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.475
Look, I forced you
to say something.

35:29.518 --> 35:32.130
But you could've chosen
the less risky procedure.

35:34.349 --> 35:36.786
My grandma goes for it.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.527
I mean,

35:38.571 --> 35:41.269
that's just who she is.

35:41.313 --> 35:44.925
So I chose what I thought
she would want me to do.

35:44.968 --> 35:47.188
There you go.

35:47.232 --> 35:50.191
Then you made
the right decision.

35:52.237 --> 35:54.935
What if she doesn't
see it that way?

35:54.978 --> 35:56.980
Well, you go in there,

35:57.024 --> 35:59.026
and if she needs
to be mad at you,

35:59.069 --> 36:01.333
let her be mad.

36:01.376 --> 36:05.337
You're not just in charge
of her medical decisions,

36:05.380 --> 36:09.558
'cause accepting
the consequences...

36:09.602 --> 36:11.517
that's a decision too.

36:31.406 --> 36:32.842
Grandma.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.200
Come here, baby.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.115
Come here.

37:03.786 --> 37:06.093
- Hi, hi, sorry.
- Hey.

37:07.616 --> 37:09.009
Is everything okay?

37:09.052 --> 37:10.271
Yeah, man, welcome.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.708
How in the world
did I miss this?

37:14.667 --> 37:16.973
You wanna give it a go?

37:18.584 --> 37:19.933
Uh, oh, that?
No.

37:19.976 --> 37:20.890
No, thank you.

37:20.934 --> 37:21.935
Not in my wheelhouse.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.893
Not mine either...

37:23.937 --> 37:25.678
till I got hit by a truck
and had to rebuild

37:25.721 --> 37:27.114
my entire body from scratch.

37:27.157 --> 37:29.116
- Wow.
- Yeah.

37:29.159 --> 37:31.466
- You did that.
- Yeah, yeah.

37:31.510 --> 37:32.685
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

37:32.728 --> 37:35.775
I have a bad back and bad arms,

37:35.818 --> 37:38.299
bad legs, bad everything, so...

37:38.343 --> 37:40.562
Well, this will help.
It did for me.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.434
What do you got to lose?

37:44.174 --> 37:46.612
Well, I would say my dignity,

37:46.655 --> 37:50.180
but, uh, that sucker left
the building ages ago.

37:50.224 --> 37:53.183
So what the heck?
- All right, my man.

37:53.227 --> 37:55.664
- Give it a go.
- Okay, so over here,

37:55.708 --> 37:57.144
we got a deadlift.

37:57.187 --> 37:59.146
That's not helping.

37:59.189 --> 38:00.843
Okay, so hip's-width stance.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.715
Hands just outside the hips.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.194
Right.
- Kay.

38:04.238 --> 38:05.413
Your shoulders slightly
in front of the bar, right?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.110
- Yeah.
- And then your hips

38:07.154 --> 38:08.373
and shoulders are gonna rise

38:08.416 --> 38:10.113
at the same time.
- Right, okay.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.333
Just grab the bar and lift.

38:12.377 --> 38:13.813
Grab the bar and lift,
he says.

38:13.856 --> 38:16.468
- Yeah, man.
- Here we go.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.339
Just lift the thing.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.819
Just--

38:19.862 --> 38:21.168
just pick it up.
Here we go.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.523
Aah!

38:28.567 --> 38:32.266
All right!

38:32.310 --> 38:35.965
All right.

38:36.009 --> 38:38.577
You feel that?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.883
Oh, I felt it.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.452
I felt something.

39:07.997 --> 39:08.955
Yeah?

39:08.998 --> 39:10.043
N.A.?

39:10.086 --> 39:11.479
The meeting's upstairs.

39:23.361 --> 39:26.059
Hey, Doc!
Thanks for comin'.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.278
Will you hustle up?
Come on!

39:28.322 --> 39:31.238
Get out of the street--
for obvious reasons.

39:31.281 --> 39:34.154
Did the, um, Venmo
not go through?

39:34.197 --> 39:35.634
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

39:35.677 --> 39:37.549
While you were
nobly flailing today,

39:37.592 --> 39:40.726
I was thinking to myself,
if you actually fixed this

39:40.769 --> 39:44.382
intersection, then you would
ruin my entire business plan.

39:44.425 --> 39:46.514
Well, it's New York,
so I'm sure you can find

39:46.558 --> 39:49.256
another dangerous
intersection somewhere.

39:49.299 --> 39:51.563
Well, my thoughts exactly!

39:51.606 --> 39:52.999
So I took your money.

39:54.392 --> 39:58.787
And I bought this.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.313
- You got paint.
- I got paint.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.447
- Are we-are we doing this?
- You are so doing it.

40:06.491 --> 40:08.318
- Oh, I'm doing this?
- And I'm so overseeing it.

40:08.362 --> 40:10.103
Great, where's the brush?

40:10.146 --> 40:12.671
Mary, you're here!
Take this.

40:14.281 --> 40:15.500
I'll just share with him, okay?

40:15.543 --> 40:17.719
Oh, my God,
you guys are so great!

40:17.763 --> 40:19.417
Take this.
Take this.

40:19.460 --> 40:20.809
- You're gonna want that.
- Yeah.

40:23.029 --> 40:26.032
What about the guys?
Who else is here?

40:30.950 --> 40:32.995
You can help...

40:33.039 --> 40:34.170
there.

40:35.824 --> 40:38.261
Shall we?
