00:33.117 --> 00:35.629
Adaptation: Any1, Sixe

00:38.326 --> 00:39.484
Here we are!

00:40.556 --> 00:42.717
Your place... your place...

00:43.958 --> 00:46.659
La maison... de la femme...

00:47.499 --> 00:49.789
El casa del signorita...

00:53.275 --> 00:54.660
Das haus die Frau...

00:58.014 --> 00:59.014
Good night!

00:59.521 --> 01:02.061
I'll just walk you to the door.

01:02.132 --> 01:04.128
- There's no need.
- That's okay.

01:10.141 --> 01:11.146
So...

01:12.182 --> 01:13.987
I guess this is "arrivederci".

01:15.756 --> 01:17.755
I'd quite fancy a cup of tea though.

01:20.106 --> 01:21.383
A glass of water maybe.

01:23.522 --> 01:24.966
Perhaps a little lie down.

01:25.029 --> 01:26.039
Look...

01:26.586 --> 01:28.207
I have to tell you something.

01:28.383 --> 01:29.200
What?

01:29.201 --> 01:31.535
I wanted to tell you
in the restaurant but...

01:31.706 --> 01:34.030
it... a good time
never came up and I...

01:34.146 --> 01:36.443
- I wasn't gonna say it but...
- Say it.

01:37.285 --> 01:38.285
I have to.

01:41.547 --> 01:42.547
What?

01:42.899 --> 01:44.510
You've got shit on your head.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.409
What?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.333
There's some shit on your head.

01:52.414 --> 01:53.414
What?

01:53.478 --> 01:55.204
Where? Where?

01:55.836 --> 01:57.254
It's been there forever.

01:57.342 --> 01:59.573
Oh God! Oh God!

02:02.439 --> 02:03.439
It's chocolate!

02:03.695 --> 02:04.499
It's chocolate!

02:04.500 --> 02:05.500
It's not shit!

02:05.545 --> 02:06.398
It's not shit!

02:06.399 --> 02:07.399
It's..

02:07.897 --> 02:08.896
It's my dessert.

02:09.852 --> 02:11.810
I don't know
how it got there but uh...

02:11.811 --> 02:12.866
It's on my fingers.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
It's not shit!

02:15.719 --> 02:16.774
Thank God for that!

02:18.976 --> 02:21.571
You know, I just spent the last hour

02:21.892 --> 02:24.693
thinking you were some sort
of disgusting tramp.

02:24.774 --> 02:26.076
Oh no!

02:27.827 --> 02:28.827
That's funny!

02:30.995 --> 02:32.921
- Oh God look!
- What?

02:33.021 --> 02:35.439
It's chocolate!

02:38.339 --> 02:40.005
How about that cup of tea now?

02:43.693 --> 02:46.294
I was a perfect gentleman last night
from beginning to end

02:46.295 --> 02:49.389
but she can't see past
a little bit of shit on my forehead!

02:49.412 --> 02:50.900
I thought you said it was chocolate.

02:50.935 --> 02:52.981
Yes, chocolate, yes!
I meant chocolate.

02:54.319 --> 02:56.041
I forgot to turn this thing on.

02:57.263 --> 02:58.263
<i>Hello, IT. .</i>

02:59.160 --> 03:01.548
<i>Hi, uh, something's wrong
with my computer.</i>

03:01.719 --> 03:04.015
<i>Have you tried
turning it off and on again? <i></i></i>

03:04.016 --> 03:05.629
<i>Oh No! No, oh Dear, thanks.</i>

03:06.163 --> 03:07.278
<i>You're welcome then.</i>

03:08.487 --> 03:09.532
It's typical.

03:09.579 --> 03:12.529
The one time I manage
to bamboozle a girl in the building

03:12.530 --> 03:14.752
into going out with me
and this happens.

03:15.374 --> 03:16.725
She's gonna tell everyone!

03:16.842 --> 03:18.999
Oh come on! She's a receptionist,

03:19.161 --> 03:20.564
she'd hardly gossip.

03:21.841 --> 03:23.557
Besides it's a boring story.

03:23.846 --> 03:25.631
Yeah... that's boring.

03:25.949 --> 03:27.893
It's boring, she won't tell anyone.

03:39.744 --> 03:40.744
Hello.

03:48.012 --> 03:49.012
Sorry guys.

03:55.219 --> 03:56.782
She might have told Jen.

04:00.127 --> 04:01.842
No, that's what I'm saying.

04:02.126 --> 04:03.092
It wasn't. It was...

04:03.435 --> 04:05.379
It was chocolate. It was chocolate.

04:06.286 --> 04:07.939
I don't know...
I don't know... it...

04:07.940 --> 04:09.944
it got on my fingers
and then I must have...

04:09.945 --> 04:11.101
Listen...

04:11.181 --> 04:13.018
how did you even hear
about this, mom?

04:15.250 --> 04:18.244
Moss... Moss,
there's a spider in my office.

04:18.308 --> 04:20.752
Could you deal with it?
I just hate spiders.

04:24.160 --> 04:27.722
I'm not overly fond of them
myself there, Jen.

04:28.558 --> 04:29.673
How...

04:31.845 --> 04:35.215
How big is... Whoa! Hey now!

04:35.353 --> 04:36.740
I'll tell you what.

04:36.775 --> 04:39.750
I actually recommend
my good friend Roy there

04:39.797 --> 04:42.028
as the go-to guy on anything

04:42.492 --> 04:44.136
with more than 7 eyes.

04:45.013 --> 04:47.374
He's on a very brief
personal call right now.

04:47.409 --> 04:48.548
Come, Moss. Don't be silly.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.734
You're right, I'm being silly.
Wrap it up, Roy!

04:51.568 --> 04:53.294
It's just a spider. It's fine.

04:54.392 --> 04:57.451
Oh look! It seems to have left
of its own volition.

04:57.552 --> 04:58.844
Oh, be a man, Moss!

04:58.898 --> 05:01.378
You're right, I'll be a man.
I'm a man.

05:02.968 --> 05:04.468
Please don't shut the door.

05:05.979 --> 05:06.979
I  won't.

05:07.424 --> 05:08.424
Goodbye, Jen.

05:13.031 --> 05:14.462
That was my mother.

05:14.736 --> 05:16.291
How did she hear about this?

05:16.340 --> 05:18.673
Oh, was that the woman
who phoned earlier?

05:18.739 --> 05:20.793
'Cause I've just been
telling everybody.

05:20.794 --> 05:23.697
Why would you want to go out
with Patricia anyway?

05:23.749 --> 05:26.717
I mean, her last boyfriend
was Simon from 3rd.

05:27.104 --> 05:28.637
- Jen!
- Hey, you!

05:29.163 --> 05:30.163
Hello there.

05:30.547 --> 05:31.984
Have you caught it yet?

05:32.313 --> 05:33.623
Not quite, Jen.

05:34.264 --> 05:36.430
The spider's managed
to walk behind me.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.003
And it's between me and the door.

05:40.628 --> 05:42.059
So I can't get out.

05:43.532 --> 05:45.754
Simon from 3rd
is the one with the hair.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.304
Oh, him! Oh, he's awful.

05:48.790 --> 05:51.563
He once ate
a copy of Loaded for a bet.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.433
- She liked him?
- Apparently.

05:55.691 --> 05:57.230
That explains everything!

05:57.304 --> 06:00.470
She likes the kind of big obnoxious guy
who eats Loaders.

06:03.555 --> 06:04.555
Hello, Daniel.

06:05.206 --> 06:06.011
How  are you?

06:06.012 --> 06:07.466
I'm great, thanks. How are you?

06:07.467 --> 06:08.467
I'm great.

06:08.717 --> 06:11.384
Well, can either of you tell me...
Okay... Okay...

06:11.804 --> 06:16.184
who wrote Missa Brevis in D minor?
Was it Mozart or Beethoven?

06:17.345 --> 06:20.428
That was a certain Mr. Mozart,
I think you'll find.

06:20.598 --> 06:23.137
Oh right, do you know a lot
about classical music?

06:23.219 --> 06:25.497
- Petit pois.
- Oh, right.

06:27.384 --> 06:29.298
Mozart, Beethoven, 50/50 ain't it?

06:30.991 --> 06:33.720
Actually, no, you were right.
It was Mozart.

06:33.791 --> 06:34.848
Well it's... It was...

06:34.866 --> 06:36.932
Okay, so, let's try another one.

06:37.387 --> 06:40.829
Okay. Here we go.
In what year did Mozart die?

06:40.913 --> 06:43.754
- Was it 1780 or 1791?
- 1791.

06:44.593 --> 06:48.233
Yes! Yes! Bang on! Good!

06:49.287 --> 06:51.342
God!
I hope he doesn't come in again!

06:52.375 --> 06:53.650
- Jen!
- Yes!

06:54.145 --> 06:57.589
Is Roy off the phone yet?
The spider is now upon my person.

07:07.330 --> 07:10.054
You guys don't mind me
chilling out in here, do you?

07:10.136 --> 07:11.886
No. Chill out!

07:13.212 --> 07:15.386
So did you see the match last night?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.544
- Oh yeah!
- Oh yeah!

07:17.629 --> 07:18.712
- God!
- Did we?

07:19.312 --> 07:20.580
What a match!

07:22.388 --> 07:24.795
All of the players running up...

07:25.276 --> 07:26.023
the pitch...

07:26.024 --> 07:29.321
and running down it again.
Such athleticism!

07:30.257 --> 07:31.842
What was Rooney thinking over there?

07:32.821 --> 07:35.476
Who knows! That's Rooney!

07:35.602 --> 07:38.647
He is a foolish boy!

07:40.446 --> 07:43.755
Yeah but... that referee...
I'm sorry the referee is just an idiot.

07:43.816 --> 07:47.327
Yes, he was certainly
the villain of the piece.

07:48.954 --> 07:50.386
Daniel, you're still here.

07:50.764 --> 07:52.810
Yeah, just...
just having a little break.

07:52.811 --> 07:54.477
Do you wanna come and join me?

07:55.768 --> 07:56.655
Stop it!

07:58.381 --> 08:01.423
Well, I'd better...
I'd better... hit this way.

08:01.624 --> 08:04.323
Oh by the way, guys, if you need
any help with any more spiders,

08:04.324 --> 08:06.036
just give me a call, okay?

08:06.177 --> 08:08.244
Yeah, we'll be fine, I think, thanks.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.013
Actually, do you have a card?

08:11.054 --> 08:13.097
That is good. See you.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.872
You like him!

08:19.975 --> 08:20.934
Who?

08:21.580 --> 08:24.315
Oh, that good looking man
with "Security"

08:24.362 --> 08:25.596
written on his shoulders? Yes!

08:25.784 --> 08:26.784
Yes, I do.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.606
He seems really nice.

08:29.310 --> 08:30.225
Nice!

08:30.296 --> 08:33.361
'Cause that's what you women want!
Nice guys!

08:34.095 --> 08:34.996
<i>Hello, IT! .</i>

08:34.998 --> 08:36.775
What are you talking about, Roy?

08:36.878 --> 08:40.107
If my date last night proved anything,
it's that you, ladies,

08:40.142 --> 08:41.759
you don't want nice guys.

08:41.794 --> 08:43.565
I think if your date proved anything,
Roy,

08:43.566 --> 08:46.732
it's that women like men
without poo on their foreheads.

08:47.266 --> 08:48.482
That's our type.

08:49.664 --> 08:51.261
That  has nothing to do with this.

08:51.308 --> 08:54.208
She clearly just didn't want
a gentleman in her life.

08:54.275 --> 08:56.429
I hate to generalize, you know that.

08:56.678 --> 08:59.144
But all women just want bastards.

09:00.485 --> 09:04.112
That women liking bastards thing
is a total myth.

09:04.179 --> 09:07.772
<i>I've tried turning it off and on again
and nothing happened.</i>

09:07.841 --> 09:09.396
<i>Is it definitely plugged in?</i>

09:10.651 --> 09:11.651
<i>Oh, let me have a look.</i>

09:12.200 --> 09:13.955
<i>Oh, sorry, that's it, thanks very much.</i>

09:13.956 --> 09:15.011
<i>You're welcome then.</i>

09:15.372 --> 09:17.285
It's just not true.

09:17.507 --> 09:21.141
Women don't want gentlemen,
they want bullies and thugs.

09:21.460 --> 09:22.510
I'll prove it to you.

09:22.511 --> 09:24.344
How will you prove it to me, Roy?

09:25.289 --> 09:26.417
Oh! Okay.

09:26.558 --> 09:30.313
I'll put a...
I'll put on a classified ad online.

09:30.622 --> 09:31.471
A classified?

09:31.472 --> 09:33.070
Yeah, like a lonely hearts thing

09:33.071 --> 09:34.577
but I'll make it sound psychotic.

09:34.578 --> 09:36.880
And I still bet
I'll get a bezillion replies.

09:36.881 --> 09:37.828
Oh, dear God.

09:37.829 --> 09:38.829
Come on. How much?

09:38.880 --> 09:44.016
Okay. Yeah, I'll give you
20 quid if you get 1 response.

09:44.087 --> 09:44.944
You're on!

09:45.061 --> 09:46.068
Oh my God, no!

09:47.271 --> 09:50.145
It's all about body fluids
with you, isn't it?

09:52.829 --> 09:54.581
Come on, Moss! We need to get to work.

09:54.582 --> 09:55.534
Work?

09:55.535 --> 09:58.757
Yeah, we need to post
a classified lonely hearts ad online

09:58.786 --> 10:01.250
that makes me sound like a psycho
so that I can prove to Jen

10:01.285 --> 10:04.359
that all women love bastards
and therefore win 20 pounds.

10:04.801 --> 10:07.334
Thank God!
I thought that thing was broken.

10:07.902 --> 10:10.808
"Shut up! Do what I tell you!
I'm not interested!"

10:12.356 --> 10:16.467
These are just some of the things
you'll be hearing if you answer this ad.

10:17.576 --> 10:20.576
"I'm an idiot and
I don't care about anyone but myself."

10:21.531 --> 10:23.252
"PS: No dogs."

10:25.383 --> 10:27.049
- That's good.
- What's yours?

10:27.826 --> 10:29.317
Mine doesn't look any good now.

10:29.435 --> 10:30.438
Go on.

10:31.296 --> 10:32.972
"I'm going to murder you."

10:35.699 --> 10:37.326
"You bloody woman!"

10:40.164 --> 10:42.413
Might want to play a bit hard to get.

10:44.162 --> 10:46.487
If you were a murderer,
what would your nickname be?

10:46.505 --> 10:47.797
Mine would be "The Gardener",

10:47.844 --> 10:51.002
'cause I'd always leave a rose
at the scene of the crime.

10:51.525 --> 10:53.510
What would your murder weapon be?

10:54.480 --> 10:55.480
A hammer.

10:57.783 --> 10:58.783
Hey, Moss.

11:01.836 --> 11:04.058
"Would you like to go
for dinner with me?"

11:05.428 --> 11:08.094
"And then maybe back to my place?"

11:09.249 --> 11:12.461
I'd love to, Jen, but I'm actually
helping Roy at the moment.

11:12.462 --> 11:15.799
No. No, no, no.
Who does this remind you of, yeah?

11:16.568 --> 11:18.456
"Do you wanna go on a date with me?"

11:20.994 --> 11:22.039
Gandhi?

11:24.080 --> 11:26.172
No,  no, the other one. Bono.

11:27.711 --> 11:29.379
No, no, I was doing Roy.

11:29.487 --> 11:31.740
Yes, yes, it's like there was 2 of me.

11:32.597 --> 11:34.874
Come on.
Get your money ready. 20 pounds.

11:35.951 --> 11:37.689
Hey! Hello.

11:40.251 --> 11:42.142
It's security.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.771
I hope I'm not in any danger.

11:44.974 --> 11:45.974
Oh my God!

11:46.372 --> 11:47.372
It's  not shit!

11:49.998 --> 11:51.577
On my head, it's not shit!

11:52.006 --> 11:53.357
It's chocolate spread.

11:53.681 --> 11:54.797
- Taste it!
- No!

11:54.832 --> 11:55.771
Look!

11:55.853 --> 11:56.887
Look!

12:00.598 --> 12:01.803
Ringo Starr?

12:03.403 --> 12:05.672
I'll be wondering about that all night!

12:05.855 --> 12:07.257
How do you know about this site?

12:07.258 --> 12:08.258
I'm a member.

12:09.818 --> 12:12.864
Really?
You do the whole lonely hearts thing?

12:13.628 --> 12:16.797
I'm a 32-year-old IT man
who works in a basement.

12:17.581 --> 12:19.803
Yes, I do the whole lonely hearts thing.

12:22.942 --> 12:26.155
So, as you can clearly see, it wasn't...

12:27.795 --> 12:29.828
excrement, it was chocolate.

12:30.006 --> 12:32.060
I was playing a joke. It was chocolate.

12:32.061 --> 12:34.561
Jen, it's okay, I've got it.
Don't worry about it.

12:34.808 --> 12:36.752
Listen, what are you doing tonight?

12:38.366 --> 12:40.588
- I've got a response!
- That was quick!

12:40.617 --> 12:43.138
Yeah,
why is it taking so long to download?

12:43.197 --> 12:45.164
Something happened
with the router this morning.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.012
We're back to pre-broadband speed.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.077
Dear...

12:55.989 --> 12:57.532
But we're on the phone now.

12:57.592 --> 12:59.195
Why can't you just ask me now?

12:59.270 --> 13:00.866
Can't Jen, trust me.

13:01.447 --> 13:02.645
Why should I trust you?

13:02.646 --> 13:04.590
Because I know what's good for you.

13:06.594 --> 13:10.234
Listen, you have to be home between
8 and 9 tonight, are you gonna be home?

13:10.281 --> 13:12.195
Okay, this sounds exciting.

13:12.221 --> 13:14.957
It might not happen, okay?
But hopefully it will.

13:14.979 --> 13:16.942
Now I don't know
if this is exciting or not...

13:16.988 --> 13:19.145
Jen... Jen, it's exciting!

13:23.253 --> 13:26.254
"...would be very interested in
meeting up and talking it over."

13:26.255 --> 13:27.255
"Love, Rebecca."

13:27.403 --> 13:29.347
Oh my God! What did we write again?

13:29.457 --> 13:30.901
It started with "shut up".

13:32.457 --> 13:33.662
There's more.

13:34.117 --> 13:36.617
"I attached a photograph
for your approval...

13:36.618 --> 13:38.391
"or not!" Exclamation mark.

13:38.554 --> 13:41.387
All right, let's have a look at you,
you mad thing.

13:45.168 --> 13:46.419
Nice hair so far.

13:47.569 --> 13:50.514
- Eyebrows seem normal.
- Two eyes.

13:51.279 --> 13:53.021
That's the best amount of eyes.

13:54.285 --> 13:55.431
Nice eyes too.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.842
It has to go around.
She must have a shite nose.

14:01.576 --> 14:03.540
Do you remember the Internet
at this speed?

14:03.609 --> 14:05.581
Up all night and you'd see 8 women.

14:08.559 --> 14:10.503
- Good nose.
- That is a good nose.

14:10.614 --> 14:14.780
The mouth has to be wrong. There's gotta
be something wrong with her mouth.

14:14.825 --> 14:16.922
Now that's a good looking woman.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.607
Should I tell Jen we got a reply?

14:20.976 --> 14:21.976
Roy?

14:23.034 --> 14:24.034
Roy?

14:25.739 --> 14:26.739
Roy!

14:28.392 --> 14:29.392
Roy!

14:36.900 --> 14:39.008
Hello, Daniel! I mean, hello.

14:39.903 --> 14:43.846
Jen? Hello, it's Chris Tarrant from
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

14:43.909 --> 14:46.422
Oh my God! Oh my God!

14:46.469 --> 14:47.822
Chris Tarrant, hello!

14:48.324 --> 14:51.048
Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!

14:51.158 --> 14:53.378
Jen the next voice you hear
is gonna be Daniel's...

14:53.413 --> 14:55.827
- Daniel's, Ok.
- But before I put you on with him,

14:55.828 --> 14:57.828
he's asked me to ask you a question.

14:57.930 --> 14:59.263
Okay, you can ask me a question.

14:59.331 --> 15:03.598
Yeah, he wants to know if you'll go out
for dinner with him tomorrow night.

15:04.311 --> 15:06.549
Oh really? Yes!

15:06.619 --> 15:09.143
Yes, of course, I will!
Of course! Oh yes! Yes!

15:09.213 --> 15:10.213
Yes, of course!

15:11.576 --> 15:13.096
Yes, that's great, Jen.

15:13.665 --> 15:15.475
Now let me fill you in
on what's happening.

15:15.476 --> 15:18.864
Daniel's doing very well although
he has just used his 50/50.

15:18.916 --> 15:21.382
Now, here's Daniel.
Daniel, you got 30 seconds.

15:21.476 --> 15:23.216
Starting from... now!

15:23.382 --> 15:24.787
- Okay, Jen.
- Hi, Daniel.

15:24.788 --> 15:26.689
<i>Yeah, hi Jen, Jen, uh, okay...</i>

15:26.942 --> 15:28.664
<i>who composed The Wooden Prince?</i>

15:28.792 --> 15:31.159
<i>Was it A) Bartok, B) Chopin ?</i>

15:37.154 --> 15:39.580
Did you see
"I'm a Millionaire" last night?

15:39.604 --> 15:42.035
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"
it's called. No, I didn't.

15:42.070 --> 15:44.582
Well, you are not going to
Adam and beliEVE this.

15:45.408 --> 15:47.925
Okay, do these make me
look like a bastard?

15:48.618 --> 15:50.149
Why do you wanna look like a bastard?

15:50.150 --> 15:52.602
I've got that date tonight,
she's expecting a monster.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.607
Do these me make look like a bastard?

15:54.608 --> 15:56.135
They make you look like an idiot.

15:56.170 --> 15:57.866
- Anyway, did you see it?
- What?

15:58.125 --> 16:00.239
"Do you want to be a Millionaire?"

16:00.566 --> 16:02.945
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

16:04.790 --> 16:07.432
"Who wants to be a person who is wrong?"

16:08.569 --> 16:09.790
What's happened?

16:10.027 --> 16:11.193
- If I may...
- Sure.

16:11.531 --> 16:13.253
Guess who was on it last night!

16:13.882 --> 16:15.823
- You!
- No, Daniel.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.300
- King of men.
- Daniel was on "Millionaire"?

16:18.301 --> 16:19.356
Indeed he was, sir.

16:19.515 --> 16:21.753
And it was the
"Do you want to phone a friend"...

16:21.800 --> 16:23.737
- It's just "Phone a friend".
- Anyway.

16:24.603 --> 16:25.777
She was the "phone a friend"?

16:25.836 --> 16:28.571
- She was the "phone a friend".
- You're the "phone a friend"!

16:28.572 --> 16:29.568
What was the subject?

16:29.569 --> 16:32.957
Classical music is the extraordinary
answer to that question.

16:33.250 --> 16:37.231
So who of course is Daniel, our estimed
temp security guard, going to phone

16:37.232 --> 16:38.954
but Jonathan Miller over here.

16:39.343 --> 16:43.394
Think Daniel was on Millionaire.
Too bad it wasn't 50/50.

16:44.289 --> 16:45.289
It was.

16:46.134 --> 16:47.546
- And?
- I got it wrong.

16:48.495 --> 16:50.064
I cost 31,000 pounds.

16:51.154 --> 16:52.680
It isn't funny though.

16:52.749 --> 16:54.405
Now I have to go on a date with him.

16:54.406 --> 16:56.402
Wow! The rules on that show
have really changed!

16:56.437 --> 16:58.775
No, you don't understand.

16:59.109 --> 17:00.267
He asked me out

17:00.366 --> 17:01.366
on the show

17:01.540 --> 17:03.327
before I got the question wrong.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.963
It was all very romantic.

17:06.329 --> 17:07.329
But now...

17:07.724 --> 17:09.637
I don't think he likes me now.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.932
And I don't wanna go out with
the biggest loser in England...

17:12.983 --> 17:14.397
There you are!

17:14.583 --> 17:15.583
Daniel...

17:16.434 --> 17:17.434
- Hello.
- Hi.

17:19.592 --> 17:21.842
- Gonna go for this meal then.
- Yeah.

17:22.348 --> 17:23.435
Yeah, I can't wait.

17:23.482 --> 17:26.242
I'm gonna take you to one
of my favourite restaurants.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.310
Right.

17:31.002 --> 17:32.002
I'll pay.

17:32.823 --> 17:35.182
- It really is the least I can do.
- Oh yeah...

17:40.388 --> 17:41.388
Oh my God!

17:41.691 --> 17:43.206
Did you see that look?

17:43.532 --> 17:46.585
I  have a dinner date with that man.

17:46.654 --> 17:49.660
If I'm not here tomorrow,
I want you to call the police.

17:49.801 --> 17:52.833
Maybe not the best time to mention it,
but also you owe me 20 quids.

17:52.834 --> 17:54.996
What? You got a response?

17:55.394 --> 17:57.282
With the one that ended: "No dogs"?

17:57.545 --> 17:58.545
Yep.

17:58.547 --> 18:00.211
Oh my God, brilliant! More money gone!

18:00.247 --> 18:02.700
Now the money that Daniel lost
wasn't really yours, was it?

18:02.701 --> 18:05.145
It would have been
if I'd married him, Moss.

18:06.558 --> 18:07.859
I need a good restaurant.

18:07.860 --> 18:11.526
Maybe if he likes the food,
he won't beat me to death with a shoe.

18:12.012 --> 18:15.205
I thought you said you'd take him
to one of your favourite restaurants.

18:15.252 --> 18:16.707
Haven't you got it yet?

18:17.088 --> 18:18.234
That's what I do:

18:18.433 --> 18:19.433
I lie...

18:19.714 --> 18:21.851
I lie and I lie and...

18:21.940 --> 18:22.940
I lie!

18:23.848 --> 18:26.008
Well, I went to a good place recently.

18:26.096 --> 18:27.939
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.

18:28.151 --> 18:30.049
- Really?
- Yes. Why?

18:30.552 --> 18:33.005
Sorry, I just didn't have you down
as a restaurant person.

18:33.006 --> 18:34.161
I'm a restaurant person.

18:34.162 --> 18:35.897
Why wouldn't I be a restaurant person?

18:35.932 --> 18:37.060
Cheese string?

18:38.044 --> 18:39.213
No, thanks.

18:39.279 --> 18:40.425
What's this place called?

18:40.426 --> 18:41.426
Messijoes.

18:41.676 --> 18:44.064
- Is that French?
- French? No, it's English.

18:45.182 --> 18:47.488
Okay, thank you, Moss. Yeah, I'll uh...

18:47.489 --> 18:48.600
I'll give that a go.

18:49.037 --> 18:51.459
Okay, I need a place to bring this girl

18:51.743 --> 18:54.215
that says: "I'm a bastard."

18:54.400 --> 18:56.511
Well, I went to a good place recently.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.651
Nice atmosphere. Food's great.
It's got a bit of an edge.

18:59.652 --> 19:00.757
Yeah? What's it called?

19:00.758 --> 19:01.758
Messijoes.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.257
What is that? Spanish?

19:03.339 --> 19:07.038
No! Spanish? It's English. Messijoes.

19:26.352 --> 19:29.745
Okey dokey,
you get the firecracker nachos.

19:30.163 --> 19:33.611
And you are getting
the prawn bites with spicy salsa.

19:37.970 --> 19:41.831
This seems an unusual place
for someone like you to want to meet.

19:44.478 --> 19:45.478
Yeah but...

19:46.581 --> 19:50.252
everyone needs a place to come
to be alone.

19:50.318 --> 19:52.596
Look at me! Yeah! Look at me!

19:57.086 --> 19:59.011
Get a clown over here, please!

20:00.754 --> 20:01.806
You're a loner?

20:01.953 --> 20:03.644
I'm a loner all right.

20:05.346 --> 20:06.555
I'm just a...

20:07.515 --> 20:09.154
lonely loner

20:09.966 --> 20:12.044
on a lonely road.

20:14.320 --> 20:15.576
Alone.

20:17.235 --> 20:18.779
Do you always wear shades?

20:19.237 --> 20:20.237
Always.

20:21.710 --> 20:23.336
They help me hide the fact

20:23.942 --> 20:24.942
I'm always lying

20:26.751 --> 20:27.751
to women.

20:34.959 --> 20:39.022
<i>Everyone is having having fun, fun, fun.</i>

20:39.216 --> 20:41.716
<i>'Cause everything is nice
and everyone is friendly.</i>

20:41.717 --> 20:44.070
<i>Lots of friendly faces
having fun, fun, fun.</i>

20:44.071 --> 20:46.678
<i>'Cause everything is nice
and everyone is friendly.</i>

20:46.679 --> 20:49.383
<i>- Smile and the world will...</i>
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

20:49.384 --> 20:52.717
It's just... It's not... Sorry,
it's just not appropriate at the moment.

21:13.790 --> 21:15.763
You're that bloke off the telly!

21:16.453 --> 21:19.458
And you must be the woman he phoned!
Brilliant!

21:19.733 --> 21:21.566
Funniest thing I've seen in ages.

21:33.470 --> 21:34.855
God! I'm a bastard!

21:35.897 --> 21:37.937
Yes. So you keep saying.

21:38.465 --> 21:40.649
Trouble... It's basically what I am.

21:43.961 --> 21:44.961
Thank you.

21:48.164 --> 21:49.219
You know something?

21:50.619 --> 21:52.730
I don't think you're a bastard at all.

21:53.178 --> 21:54.178
I am so.

21:54.819 --> 21:56.533
I am a complete tool.

21:58.951 --> 21:59.926
Oh my God!

22:00.008 --> 22:02.216
No don't, don't! Don't hit him!

22:07.039 --> 22:08.039
I know her.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.167
Hey! What's going on?

22:14.294 --> 22:15.783
Stay out of this, Fonzy!

22:15.835 --> 22:17.197
You're fighting in front of kids!

22:17.244 --> 22:18.160
I don't care!

22:18.183 --> 22:19.205
You're a brute!

22:19.228 --> 22:20.872
This bloke just insulted me!

22:21.457 --> 22:24.404
Hey! Bit more careful
with the clown shoe there, Mister.

22:29.609 --> 22:31.171
Just hold your head back.

22:33.615 --> 22:34.836
Oh God!

22:38.923 --> 22:40.311
He caught me by surprise.

22:42.505 --> 22:44.090
When I see him tomorrow...

22:45.243 --> 22:47.539
- That was his last day.
- Thank God!

22:47.882 --> 22:49.509
Oh my God, look!

22:49.586 --> 22:51.539
If you're coming,
can you just bloody hurry up!

22:51.540 --> 22:53.296
- I'm coming! I...
- God's sake!

22:53.297 --> 22:55.130
I just need to take my shoes off.

22:56.182 --> 22:57.638
They look like such fruits.

23:02.159 --> 23:04.238
- I'll call you a cab.
- No, no, no, it's fine.

23:04.261 --> 23:05.616
- Taxi!
- I'll get my bus.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.561
Don't be stupid, it's cold. Taxi!

23:08.067 --> 23:09.272
- Here.
- Oh God.

23:09.529 --> 23:11.279
Here you can have your 20 back.

23:11.338 --> 23:14.930
I don't really think the bet
proved anything. Taxi!

23:28.850 --> 23:29.996
Thanks, Roy.

23:30.748 --> 23:32.351
- I just want...
- Nice date!

23:36.061 --> 23:39.408
Just a lonely loner
walking a lonely road.

23:44.326 --> 23:45.326
<i>Hi, girls.</i>

23:45.371 --> 23:48.455
<i>My name is Maurice Moss.</i>
<i>Or Moss for short.</i>
