00:01.040 --> 00:03.359
- Where's Jenny?
- Alec's cooked a meal.

00:03.359 --> 00:07.069
- She's coming down afterwards?
- She may prefer sex.

00:07.079 --> 00:10.279
- She never comes to the pub.
- She was here yesterday.

00:10.279 --> 00:12.839
All right, she sometimes
never comes to the pub.

00:12.839 --> 00:15.599
It's like she's got something better to do.

00:15.599 --> 00:18.599
She's in a relationship, isn't she?

00:19.199 --> 00:21.799
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

00:21.799 --> 00:25.600
Only there's no point her
coming down the pub, is there?

00:25.600 --> 00:30.850
Some of us are here because we enjoy
the sense of community and fraternity.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.120
Kurt, get a move on
with my drink, you twat.

00:34.120 --> 00:37.920
I'm not saying it's not fun but
I could think of better things to do.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.160
Some of us are here because
there's nothing we'd rather do.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.918
Take Kurt, for example. He's thrilled.

00:43.919 --> 00:47.480
Kurt, tell Simon why you come here
every evening without fail.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.770
- I've got to. Just in case.
- In case of what?

00:51.599 --> 00:51.600
In case one evening a sexy, rich lady
stumbles across this pub

00:55.120 --> 00:58.320
- and invites me back for sex.
- Shoot me now.

00:58.320 --> 01:01.320
Never forgive myself if I wasn't here.

- Aren't you going to ask?
- Ask what?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.810
- What's up?
- I'll be keeping out of this.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.280
- Since you asked...
- I didn't.

02:25.280 --> 02:27.120
- Well, could you?
- What's up?

02:27.120 --> 02:29.160
- Nothing.
- I'm glad to hear it.

02:29.160 --> 02:31.199
- Do you think something's up?
- No.

02:31.199 --> 02:35.080
You've got the job and flat
you've always wanted. And Alec.

02:35.080 --> 02:38.479
For the first time since I can remember
I actually feel secure.

02:38.479 --> 02:40.520
- Isn't that a good thing?
- It is.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.999
I'm just worried it's not all that exciting.

02:42.999 --> 02:45.039
It's a good job I didn't hear that.

02:45.039 --> 02:48.119
It sounded like you were saying
your life wasn't exciting.

02:48.119 --> 02:50.158
- Go away, Simon.
- Relax!

02:50.159 --> 02:52.920
This is something
we've all had to come to terms with.

02:52.920 --> 02:56.140
I realised your life
wasn't exciting ages ago.

03:00.759 --> 03:03.769
(Jenny) Don't you think
your life's boring?

03:06.479 --> 03:09.039
I can't even believe
you asked that question.

03:09.039 --> 03:11.720
- Which question?
- Don't I think my life is boring?

03:11.720 --> 03:14.119
(Kurt) You don't think
your life is boring?

03:14.119 --> 03:17.969
My life is a rich tapestry
of experience and diversity.

03:18.880 --> 03:22.399
- We're out of English Breakfast!
- What are we talking about?

03:22.399 --> 03:24.960
Jenny's concerned that her life is boring.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.999
Oh, that.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.640
What do we do?
Wake up, shag, go to school, go home.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.718
Shag, fall asleep.

03:33.719 --> 03:37.079
- Plus we go to the pub.
- Do we have that much sex?

03:37.079 --> 03:39.640
You'll have to substitute shag with wank.

03:39.640 --> 03:42.640
- Yeah.
- When you were a child...

03:42.960 --> 03:47.039
When you were younger,
is this all you thought life would be?

03:47.039 --> 03:49.600
Maybe with more sex
but basically, yeah.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.998
I never expected much sex.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.520
But don't you think
it's all a bit predictable?

03:54.520 --> 03:57.520
Watch. Any second now,
Penny comes in.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.999
Penny's always late.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.160
(Jenny) She's always late
by the same amount of time.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.680
She always goes
straight to her pigeonhole,

04:09.680 --> 04:12.479
even though
there's never anything it in,

04:12.479 --> 04:16.279
notices Bob watching her,
makes polite small talk with him

04:16.279 --> 04:19.440
and then pretends
she's got to talk to someone else.

04:19.440 --> 04:22.440
Cue Clare.

04:22.920 --> 04:26.140
Good morning.
Owing to the extortionate nature

04:26.640 --> 04:30.630
of the stationery bill
we're having a stationery amnesty.

04:33.359 --> 04:36.560
Carol will set up a deposit box
in the staff room.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.479
Please return any stationery
you have lying around,

04:39.479 --> 04:42.400
otherwise you'll have
nothing to write with.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.480
We can't be having that, can we?

04:44.480 --> 04:46.638
(Bell)

04:46.639 --> 04:50.119
How much did they waste
printing memos about not wasting?

04:50.119 --> 04:52.399
Stationery amnesty. How exciting!

04:52.399 --> 04:54.519
English Department meeting Friday.

04:54.519 --> 04:57.399
We're allocating
our departmental library funds.

04:57.399 --> 05:00.399
(Simon) Can't wait.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.930
- My life's OK, isn't it?
- I wouldn't go that far.

05:11.519 --> 05:16.069
Good morning! And I hope you had
as exciting an evening as I did.

05:16.279 --> 05:19.159
- Katherine.
- Hold on a sec.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.199
Can you hold on a sec?

05:21.200 --> 05:24.630
Listen, I've got to go.
I will do. Love you, too.

05:24.679 --> 05:28.039
- Right.
- Don't let them get you down. Bye-bye.

05:28.480 --> 05:31.490
- When you've quite finished.
- Bye. Sorry.

05:31.919 --> 05:35.119
Perhaps you'd like to tell us
what was so interesting.

05:35.119 --> 05:39.440
- Oh, it's not that exciting.
- More exciting than what we're doing?

05:39.440 --> 05:42.038
We're doing registration.

05:42.039 --> 05:44.359
Well, let's hear it then.

05:44.360 --> 05:46.399
Well, there's this boy, Shane.

05:46.399 --> 05:49.599
He's supposed to be going out
with Clare, my best mate.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.480
But Clare caught him
snogging Julie, who's a cow.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.920
So Clare dumps him
and starts seeing Dave,

05:54.920 --> 05:57.479
who's Shane's best mate.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.910
- His best mate?
- Except Dave didn't tell Shane.

06:00.959 --> 06:03.999
So Shane starts missing Clare
and goes round to her house,

06:03.999 --> 06:06.039
and catches them snogging.

06:06.040 --> 06:08.279
- What did he do?
- He went mental.

06:08.279 --> 06:12.640
Now he's "not interested". Clare won't
see Dave cos she doesn't fancy him

06:12.640 --> 06:15.360
and Dave and Shane
won't speak to each other.

06:15.360 --> 06:19.280
Right. It's not actually that interesting
though, is it?

06:21.039 --> 06:24.360
It's quite interesting
but we're doing registration

06:24.360 --> 06:27.920
which is more important
if not terribly interesting.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.040
(Mobile)

06:29.040 --> 06:31.678
Right, that's it. Give it here.

06:31.679 --> 06:34.679
- It's Shane.
- What does he want?

06:35.640 --> 06:39.350
No. No, no. This is confiscated,
thank you very much.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.920
Should you really be doing that?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.358
216? That can't be right.

06:48.359 --> 06:50.759
216 phone numbers?

06:50.760 --> 06:53.760
Shit!

06:55.999 --> 06:58.199
- It's not bad.
- How many?

06:58.200 --> 07:01.210
I only bought it a couple... six weeks ago.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.039
25!

07:09.040 --> 07:11.718
I'm sure I knew more people than that.

07:11.719 --> 07:14.359
As people get older, they shed friends.

07:14.359 --> 07:17.039
But I'm already down to my last 25!

07:17.040 --> 07:20.080
At this rate I'll be a hermit
by the time I'm 30.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.799
Susan's listed twice - mobile and home.

07:22.799 --> 07:25.359
24. It's started already.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.399
It's only a list of phone numbers.

07:27.399 --> 07:30.759
It represents everyone
worth knowing in my life.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.920
Mr Tandoori?

07:36.239 --> 07:37.640
It's a curry house.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.078
One of the numbers on that list

07:40.079 --> 07:43.000
is likely to belong to the person
you end up marrying.

07:43.000 --> 07:46.200
They do say most people
have met the person they'll marry

07:46.200 --> 07:49.199
by the time they're 25,
often without knowing it.

07:49.199 --> 07:52.199
Susan, Jenny, Liz.

07:53.199 --> 07:55.639
Clare. How depressing.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.559
If it makes you feel any better,
you can delete my name.

07:58.559 --> 08:00.598
Sorry, I didn't...

08:00.599 --> 08:04.309
I don't have any objection
to marrying you in theory.

08:04.560 --> 08:07.919
- I just feel that I shouldn't have to.
- You don't.

08:07.919 --> 08:10.959
But what JP's saying
is that I probably will.

08:10.959 --> 08:14.279
Trust me, you won't.
I've done it once, remember?

08:14.279 --> 08:16.399
Plus Liz is already married.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.518
Jenny or Clare. It gets worse.

08:18.519 --> 08:22.789
- I could see you marrying Clare.
-I thought she was married.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.780
- Please, she's not my type.
- You're so her type.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.360
I'm far too much of a... loose cannon.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.759
She's bossy, authoritarian, officious.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.919
She needs someone
who encourages that.

08:36.919 --> 08:41.188
- I don't want to marry Clare.
- Not now. But some day. Soon.

08:42.679 --> 08:44.879
I'm gonna marry Clare.

08:44.880 --> 08:48.870
The point is we're all gonna marry Clare.
Metaphorically.

08:51.159 --> 08:53.519
On all our phones
there's a Clare lurking.

08:53.519 --> 08:55.560
You can't believe you'd marry them

08:55.560 --> 08:57.919
but you'll start
considering them as a maybe

08:57.919 --> 09:01.209
and before long
it's not such a bad idea and...

09:05.800 --> 09:07.840
I've got Kim Wilde's phone number.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.840
- You know Kim Wilde?
- Not physically.

09:11.319 --> 09:15.160
- Why have you got her number?
- Don't worry, I've never used it.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.159
That doesn't reassure me.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.719
When I was 13, a mate gave it to me.

09:20.720 --> 09:24.319
I've just always transferred it
from one phone book to the next.

09:24.319 --> 09:27.759
- But you've never called her.
- Just in case I need to.

09:27.759 --> 09:30.240
Why would you need to call Kim Wilde?

09:30.240 --> 09:33.880
Sometimes, when I'm feeling
a bit lonely, I say to myself,

09:33.880 --> 09:37.039
"If worst comes to worst,
I can always give Kim a call."

09:37.039 --> 09:40.000
Cheers me up,
knowing that I've got that option,

09:40.000 --> 09:44.119
knowing that however bad things
have got, they could be worse.

09:44.119 --> 09:46.159
I wouldn't be so sure.

09:46.160 --> 09:48.679
How do you know it's still her number?

09:48.679 --> 09:51.238
Bearing in mind that this was 1985

09:51.239 --> 09:54.479
and people occasionally
move house every 20 years.

09:54.479 --> 09:57.440
It was probably never her number
in the first place.

09:57.440 --> 10:00.920
And if by some miracle
you actually managed to speak to her

10:00.920 --> 10:04.200
the only thing
you're likely to hear is screaming.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.719
Just leave it!

10:06.720 --> 10:10.280
Who would you choose if you could
have a celebrity's number?

10:10.280 --> 10:12.319
Nice. Good question.

10:12.320 --> 10:15.240
It's not as simple as
who would you want to have sex with?

10:15.240 --> 10:18.240
This is someone you'd have to talk to.

10:19.080 --> 10:22.080
- Kim Wilde.
- That's the beauty of it.

10:22.999 --> 10:25.999
- Can I take it down?
- Sure.

They were just ordinary people
like you and me

10:40.359 --> 10:42.640
except with something to write about.

10:42.640 --> 10:46.520
- We've all got something to write about.
- But with us, it'd be boring.

There's exciting stuff in my life,

All right. Let's try something.

13:28.919 --> 13:31.919
it thinks of Kurt McKenna.

13:32.160 --> 13:35.170
- Where does the real Kurt live?
- America.

13:35.879 --> 13:38.959

- Me.

14:01.600 --> 14:04.600

- The pub's where it all starts.

14:04.600 --> 14:06.839
We go in, they give us alcohol.

14:14.959 --> 14:18.880
I'm gonna go home, sit on my sofa
and do you know what I'm gonna do?

I don't think my life is boring.

That implies failure on some level.

44:32.280 --> 44:35.079
Oh, look, what's
the worst that could happen?

44:35.079 --> 44:37.359
Apart from being taken hostage.

44:37.360 --> 44:39.880
At the very worst you'll have a shit time,

44:39.880 --> 44:42.759
you'll be back in six weeks
doing exactly the same job

44:42.759 --> 44:44.259
only with a beard.

44:44.799 --> 44:47.040
It's hardly the end of the world.

44:47.040 --> 44:49.400
Put it that way and I'm almost envious.

44:49.400 --> 44:52.400
- You could grow a beard.
- Thanks.

44:55.839 --> 44:58.279
You could come with me.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.679
- I can't.
- Why not?

45:00.680 --> 45:04.559
Cos I'm practical and sensible
and do not want dysentery.

45:04.559 --> 45:07.559
- But apart from that?
- Give me a hug.

45:26.399 --> 45:29.399
Thanks.

45:39.360 --> 45:42.360
- Shall we have another one?
- Fuck it.
