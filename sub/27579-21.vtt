WEBVTT

00:21.600 --> 00:23.899
This is Cat Grant
reporting live for GBS

00:23.899 --> 00:26.126
from the Babylonian Theater
in Hollywood,

00:26.126 --> 00:28.762
where Goode World Studios
is holding the world premiere

00:28.762 --> 00:31.632
of its latest blockbuster,
<i>The Great Khan.</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:34.500
-[crowd applauding]
-With me now is the name
behind the studio,

00:34.533 --> 00:36.435
<i>Gretchen Goode herself.</i>

00:36.469 --> 00:38.804
[chuckles]
<i>Oh, do call me
Granny, dear.</i>

00:38.804 --> 00:40.829
<i>Everybody does.</i>

00:40.829 --> 00:43.408
[Nightwing] Playtime
after the mission.

00:43.408 --> 00:45.378
[Black Lightning]
Say what now?

00:45.411 --> 00:47.381
[Nightwing] Uh, after
the mission, we should
catch a play.

00:47.414 --> 00:50.515
Or movie, you know.
We're in Hollywood.

00:50.515 --> 00:52.316
Seems like the thing to do.

00:52.316 --> 00:55.557
[Black Lightning] Uh, let's
focus on this thing to do.

00:55.557 --> 00:58.838
Although, I'm not sure what
a simple recon of Granny's
house will tell us.

00:58.838 --> 01:03.225
[Nightwing] I said "recon."
I never said "simple."

01:07.299 --> 01:09.558
Connor gave you
Dreamer's Mother Box.

01:09.558 --> 01:11.518
[Nightwing] Dreamer hasn't
come back for it yet.

01:11.518 --> 01:13.138
I asked Mother Box to ping

01:13.173 --> 01:15.876
if she sensed any
Apokoliptian tech inside.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.209
And ping she did.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.400
[Black Lightning]
Hey, you are not suggesting
an illegal search here.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.183
[Nightwing] That ping
was probable cause.

01:23.183 --> 01:27.134
Besides, we can't leave
old Granny alone
with Apokoliptian tech.

01:27.134 --> 01:28.956
She might hurt herself.

01:28.956 --> 01:30.424
[groans]

01:31.171 --> 01:32.406
[dog barking]

01:41.435 --> 01:44.435
[Oracle] Your Darkwear
is picking up Granny's
wireless security network.

01:46.337 --> 01:48.206
Activating
counter-frequency pulse

01:48.239 --> 01:50.239
from your
Darkwear transmitter.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.444
Cameras down.

01:53.926 --> 01:56.477
This is too easy.

01:58.218 --> 01:59.718
[Black Lightning]
This is too easy.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.221
[Nightwing] I know, I know,
but we've got Mother Box.

02:02.254 --> 02:06.153
If things turn Apokoliptian,
we'll boom tube out.

02:12.431 --> 02:13.431
[static]

02:13.431 --> 02:16.043
Nightwing, I lost
your signal. Nightwing?

02:21.806 --> 02:23.513
[Black Lightning]
I don't see anything.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.513
[Nightwing exclaims]

02:33.752 --> 02:36.901
[theme music playing]

03:01.812 --> 03:04.348
[laughing]

03:06.919 --> 03:08.419
[laughter]

03:13.425 --> 03:14.723
[Wyynde speaking in Atlantean]

03:17.364 --> 03:18.364
[responding in Atlantean]

03:24.336 --> 03:25.836
[laughter]

03:53.000 --> 03:54.401
[Oracle in English] I'm sorry.

03:54.431 --> 03:55.936
Wonder Woman's in space,

03:55.967 --> 03:57.537
Batman and Robin
are in Africa,

03:57.568 --> 03:59.406
and Miss Martian's leading
a team mission.

03:59.437 --> 04:01.608
I know the risks.

04:01.639 --> 04:04.776
But right now, you are
our only option for rescuing
Nightwing and Lightning.

04:04.776 --> 04:05.913
I'll provide backup.

04:05.943 --> 04:06.943
[speaking in Atlantean]

04:44.117 --> 04:46.954
[Malcolm speaking English]
So, I did it.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.545
I got tested
for the meta-gene.

04:49.545 --> 04:51.951
Mal, we talked about this.

04:51.951 --> 04:54.692
-Well, you got tested.
-That was for
my dissertation.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.730
I had to test my blood sample
as a control

04:56.762 --> 04:58.365
before, you know,

04:58.365 --> 05:00.572
I shrunk down to study
and alter the genome.

05:00.572 --> 05:02.161
You want to hear
my results or not?

05:02.161 --> 05:04.608
Uh, no.

05:04.608 --> 05:06.194
But... Yes.

05:06.194 --> 05:08.233
No, no, no. Oh, just tell me.

05:08.233 --> 05:11.132
No meta-gene.
I'm just a regular guy.

05:11.132 --> 05:13.612
So we both tested negative.
That's fine.

05:13.612 --> 05:17.175
Yeah, but wouldn't it
have been cool if
Karen Junior was meta?

05:17.175 --> 05:20.487
Malcolm Junior doesn't have
to be meta to be cool.

05:20.487 --> 05:21.954
Of course, not.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.677
Most parents would freak.
You and I, now... [laughs]

05:24.677 --> 05:26.000
We could have totally
handled it.

05:26.000 --> 05:26.826
[chuckles]

05:26.860 --> 05:29.663
We have put in a lot of time
babysitting metas.

05:29.696 --> 05:31.732
Look, I'll love her
no matter what.

05:31.764 --> 05:35.240
I just hope our daughter
has your big beautiful brain.

05:35.240 --> 05:37.298
Your brain's beautiful, too,

05:37.298 --> 05:40.439
and our son would be
blessed to get it.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.500
Anyway, it's all
luck of the draw.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.011
Does it have to be?

05:44.043 --> 05:47.747
I mean, in a world
that's genetically
evolving so rapidly,

05:47.781 --> 05:50.483
you said genomes
can be altered.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.451
Maybe a little of your science
can give our girl an edge,

05:53.485 --> 05:55.689
or at least make sure
she can keep up.

05:55.721 --> 05:58.021
Let's just leave all
that to Mother Nature.

05:59.059 --> 06:00.761
[Karen] Mal?
[Malcolm] Yeah?

06:00.793 --> 06:03.668
[Karen] I think
my water just broke.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.838
[Silas] You sure you
don't want to come
home, Victor?

06:12.872 --> 06:14.386
Thanks, Dad.

06:14.386 --> 06:16.475
This is really where
I need to be right now.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.500
But, I'm sorry
I pushed you away.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.646
No, no.
None of that.

06:20.646 --> 06:23.415
It's a fresh start
for both of us.

06:23.617 --> 06:24.617
[elevator dings]

06:24.617 --> 06:26.918
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you, too, son.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.521
I'll call soon.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.000
Whoa! Dude, is that blood?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
[Beast Boy] Not blood.
Ketchup.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
And barbecue sauce,
and hoisin sauce,

06:36.000 --> 06:39.374
which I slipped on,
landing on my wrist
wrong, too.

06:39.374 --> 06:40.552
Ugh.

06:40.552 --> 06:44.670
One could say the restaurant's
hostage crisis became
a sticky situation,

06:44.704 --> 06:49.704
and Beast Boy couldn't cut
the mustard against the new
villain calling himself

06:49.742 --> 06:51.576
"The Condiment King."

06:51.610 --> 06:54.548
[laughing] Mother of Goat.

06:54.581 --> 06:55.983
Hey, we saved the busboy

06:55.983 --> 06:58.016
who texted the Outsiders
for help.

06:58.052 --> 07:00.586
And got some good press
out of it, too.

07:00.620 --> 07:04.757
Tara, Fred, please be careful
on your mission with Megan.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.728
-And make good choices.
-[clicks tongue]

07:07.761 --> 07:10.528
#WeAreAllOutsiders
is trending again.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.531
Congratulations, Garfield.

07:12.564 --> 07:14.500
Congratulations, Brion.

07:14.533 --> 07:15.836
Thank you.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.278
I need to hit the shower.

07:19.939 --> 07:22.509
-Ow!
-Oh. Sorry, Garfield.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.745
Fortunately, it seems
to be a minor sprain.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.680
I'll meet you
in the med bay shortly.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.848
Thanks, Doc.

07:29.682 --> 07:34.682
-Is it always like this?
-Yep, pretty much.

07:39.326 --> 07:42.528
-Violet?
-He's still so mad.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.564
And time's running out
for us to say goodbye.

07:45.598 --> 07:47.766
Maybe I should
tell him I'm sick.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.970
I'm texting my mentor tonight,

07:50.002 --> 07:53.173
and I'm hoping
he'll have good news
about your condition.

07:53.206 --> 07:57.411
Wouldn't you rather tell Brion
after we know we can cure you?

07:58.011 --> 08:00.547
Uh... I... I suppose so.

08:01.802 --> 08:02.829
Okay.

08:07.187 --> 08:11.225
[breathing heavily]

08:11.257 --> 08:14.661
[speaking English] I will
never get used to sucking
and blowing like this.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.557
-[earpiece beeps]
-Oracle?

08:16.557 --> 08:18.396
[Oracle] Receiving
Beetle Mini Drone feed.

08:18.396 --> 08:19.427
Which is good

08:19.427 --> 08:21.302
because I'm not losing track
of another squad.

08:21.302 --> 08:24.571
Transferring BMD controls
to my station.

08:24.603 --> 08:26.072
Hang tight.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.807
I'll distract Granny
to get her out of the house.

08:27.807 --> 08:30.000
[Aquaman]
<i>That will not be necessary.</i>

08:30.644 --> 08:31.677
[doorbell rings]

08:33.846 --> 08:35.115
Good evening.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.750
Aquaman? What
a pleasant surprise.

08:38.783 --> 08:41.542
Please, call me Kaldur'ahm.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.654
This is my partner, Wyynde.

08:43.654 --> 08:48.056
Kaldur'ahm, Wyynde,
please come in.

08:55.634 --> 08:57.937
Cards on the table, boys.

08:57.937 --> 09:00.250
Why are you here?

09:00.250 --> 09:03.899
Two of my friends paid you
a visit and disappeared.

09:03.899 --> 09:08.676
You mean two of your friends
broke into my home illegally.

09:08.676 --> 09:11.907
Are you here to bring
them to justice?

09:11.907 --> 09:14.652
<i>Take us to them,
and we will discuss it.</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:18.778
Whoa, this is bad.

09:18.778 --> 09:22.354
As you wish, Overlord.

09:26.865 --> 09:29.936
Kaldur, I hope you know
what you're doing.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.206
And just in case you don't...

09:34.274 --> 09:35.706
-[Karen huffing]
-[doctor] Here we are.

09:35.706 --> 09:37.009
You're doing great.
Here we go.

09:37.043 --> 09:39.745
-[Karen huffing]
-Okay. Again, Karen. Push.

09:40.831 --> 09:44.110
[screaming]

09:44.110 --> 09:45.110
You're doing great.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.019
And hey, if you hurry,

09:47.052 --> 09:48.989
our baby could still be born
on Martin Luther King's
birthday.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.724
-Well, on this
holiday, anyway.
-[Karen grunts]

09:50.754 --> 09:52.899
You did not just
ask me to hurry!

09:52.899 --> 09:54.200
No, no. Definitely not.

09:54.200 --> 09:56.461
Focus, Karen.
One last push.

09:56.461 --> 09:58.663
[grunting]

09:59.899 --> 10:01.480
[screaming]

10:05.971 --> 10:08.875
-[panting]
-[baby crying]

10:08.908 --> 10:11.245
Well, hello there.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.278
Welcome to the world,
baby girl.

10:14.315 --> 10:17.216
[panting] A baby girl.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.321
-Mal, we have a baby girl.
-You did it, beautiful.

10:20.354 --> 10:21.888
-[Karen laughing]
-You did it.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.889
The color in her fingers
and lips. Cyanosis.

10:23.923 --> 10:24.956
Let's get her to X-ray.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.360
What... What is it?

10:26.393 --> 10:29.229
Karen, Mal, stay calm.

10:29.263 --> 10:32.798
There's a problem
with your little girl.

10:32.831 --> 10:35.302
I'm telling you, Gar,
it's like a fog's cleared.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.798
I'm finally getting
how to live with this tic.

10:37.798 --> 10:40.500
Megan says it's part
of my five-stages-of-grief
healing process.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.908
She says I'm
at the final stage,

10:42.942 --> 10:44.495
acceptance.

10:46.312 --> 10:47.312
Whoa.

10:47.346 --> 10:52.148
Yeah! Beetle
taught me that one.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.000
[Victor] No way.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.225
Indulge me.

10:59.091 --> 11:00.591
[grunting]

11:05.432 --> 11:07.234
[clanking]

11:08.134 --> 11:10.085
[both] Crash!

11:14.605 --> 11:16.807
[elevator dings]

11:19.913 --> 11:21.514
Oh, it's you.

11:21.548 --> 11:25.700
I mean, sorry. I...
I thought you
might be Violet.

11:25.700 --> 11:30.224
She's been trying
to talk to me, and I've
been quite difficult.

11:30.224 --> 11:32.192
Maybe I should go
talk to her now.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.960
It is wonderful

11:33.994 --> 11:38.028
that you can forgive Violet
for Gabrielle's actions.

11:38.065 --> 11:41.768
But with all that's happened,
she feels out of control,

11:41.801 --> 11:45.038
when what she needs
to feel is in control.

11:45.072 --> 11:49.043
Just be open the next
time she approaches.

11:49.043 --> 11:50.509
That makes sense.

11:50.543 --> 11:54.000
[stammers] And sorry again,
but did you need something?

11:54.000 --> 11:55.916
Oh, it's nothing, really.

11:55.947 --> 11:59.480
Garfield was showing me
the Outsiders'
social media feed.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.822
The response to your heroics
has been amazing.

12:02.855 --> 12:04.791
You have fans.

12:04.822 --> 12:06.326
You should respond,

12:06.360 --> 12:08.293
especially to the ones
from Markovia.

12:08.293 --> 12:11.000
They really see you as a hero.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.432
Their hero.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.470
This could be
your ticket back.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.471
[Malcolm] Karen,
you just gave birth.

12:19.504 --> 12:22.274
When I let Ryan
bring you a gift
from Dr. Palmer's lab,

12:22.274 --> 12:23.942
I thought I was humoring you.

12:23.975 --> 12:26.100
I didn't think you'd
seriously try to use it.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.551
[Karen] I wasn't playing, Mal.

12:27.551 --> 12:29.451
You know me better
than to think that.

12:29.451 --> 12:32.105
Doc, back me up.
Any news on that
heart surgeon?

12:32.105 --> 12:34.552
He opens hearts, Mal,
not snow-covered roads.

12:34.552 --> 12:36.509
He'll never get here
in time to save her.

12:36.509 --> 12:38.918
Repairing a hole in the heart
is a common procedure.

12:38.918 --> 12:40.460
I've assisted
in many surgeries.

12:40.461 --> 12:44.298
Which is why you're
the perfect candidate
to assist me now, Doctor.

12:44.298 --> 12:45.677
[Malcolm] You just gave birth!

12:45.677 --> 12:47.331
This is crazy.
I take the baby
out of the mom.

12:47.365 --> 12:49.229
I never get the mom
into the baby.

12:49.229 --> 12:50.282
Be careful.

12:50.282 --> 12:51.836
I don't want to lose you, too.

12:51.870 --> 12:56.231
You're not losing
either of us.

13:04.081 --> 13:07.854
Crazy, crazy, crazy,
crazy, crazy.

13:07.884 --> 13:10.293
[Bumblebee]
<i>All right, Doctor,
I'm in the needle.</i>

13:10.293 --> 13:11.726
<i>Ready for injection.</i>

13:11.726 --> 13:12.726
Brace yourself.

13:14.057 --> 13:16.394
[heart beating]

13:18.129 --> 13:20.456
[doctor]
<i>Video feed is clear.</i>

13:20.668 --> 13:22.903
<i>I see the hole in her heart.</i>

13:22.936 --> 13:26.936
<i>The patch will work.
I'll guide you through
the correction.</i>

13:27.072 --> 13:32.274
[Gretchen] Those that require
correction and discipline
are brought here,

13:32.278 --> 13:34.859
to my X-pit,

13:34.859 --> 13:39.581
and these naughty boys
required much of both.

13:39.581 --> 13:41.422
-Obey your granny.
-[both groaning]

13:41.455 --> 13:45.125
My command is Darkseid's will.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.927
<i>Obey your granny.</i>

13:46.927 --> 13:47.927
[both grunting]

13:47.961 --> 13:51.129
[Gretchen]
My command is Darkseid's will.

13:51.163 --> 13:55.168
Still, I believe
they've learned their lesson.

13:55.201 --> 13:58.471
You're welcome to take
your two friends now.

13:58.504 --> 14:02.004
Simply step through
the wall of the cube.

14:03.043 --> 14:06.043
How gracious of you.

14:10.581 --> 14:12.552
-Obey your granny.
-[both groaning]

14:12.552 --> 14:16.322
My command is Darkseid's will.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.292
-Obey your granny.
-[grunting]

14:18.325 --> 14:21.591
Kaldur, your skin icons.

14:21.591 --> 14:23.860
The magic, it helps.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.466
[grunts] Yes. Better.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.403
[Gretchen] Obey your granny.

14:29.436 --> 14:33.173
My command is Darkseid's will.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.575
Obey your granny.

14:34.605 --> 14:38.110
My command is Darkseid's will.

14:38.200 --> 14:39.913
Obey your granny.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.585
[all breathing heavily]

14:45.653 --> 14:47.431
Overlord.

14:57.431 --> 15:00.561
Thank you for
your hospitality.

15:00.561 --> 15:02.297
We will show ourselves out.

15:04.336 --> 15:07.004
I said you could take
your two friends.

15:07.038 --> 15:12.038
I did not say he could
take the Mother Box.

15:14.245 --> 15:18.413
Mother Box is a living being.
We will not leave her behind.

15:18.413 --> 15:20.243
That wasn't the agreement.

15:20.243 --> 15:23.105
He broke the rules.
He must be disciplined.

15:23.105 --> 15:24.389
Back in the pit.

15:24.389 --> 15:25.557
No.

15:25.591 --> 15:29.697
[chuckles] Atrocious
manners, Kaldur'ahm.

15:29.730 --> 15:32.990
Such behavior
requires correction.

15:32.990 --> 15:37.466
Correction already made
to Jefferson and Richard.

15:40.504 --> 15:44.745
Now, obey your granny.

15:44.778 --> 15:48.181
My command is Darkseid's will.

15:48.215 --> 15:52.085
Teach your naughty
friends a lesson.

15:54.488 --> 15:57.090
[heart beating]

15:57.123 --> 15:59.225
[doctor]
<i>All patched.</i>

15:59.259 --> 16:01.125
<i>Blood flow and pulse
normalizing.</i>

16:01.158 --> 16:02.629
<i>Textbook finish, Karen.</i>

16:02.663 --> 16:05.163
<i>Mother Nature may not
always be perfect,</i>

16:05.197 --> 16:09.000
<i>but your little girl's lucky
to have a mother
who can fix that.</i>

16:09.000 --> 16:09.735
Thanks, Doc.

16:09.735 --> 16:13.408
Just need a minute to rest
before I come out.

16:13.408 --> 16:14.802
-Shutting down the feed.
-[static]

16:14.802 --> 16:16.375
[doctor]
<i>What? Why would...</i>

16:16.408 --> 16:19.076
[Karen]
<i>Let's just leave
all that to Mother Nature.</i>

16:19.110 --> 16:21.413
[doctor]
<i>Mother Nature
may not always be perfect...</i>

16:21.413 --> 16:24.317
[Malcolm]
<i>Maybe a little
of your science could give
our girl the edge.</i>

16:24.350 --> 16:26.620
<i>Or at least make sure
she can keep up.</i>

16:26.653 --> 16:28.488
[doctor]
<i>There's a problem
with your little girl.</i>

16:28.522 --> 16:30.624
[echoing]
<i>There's a problem
with your little girl.</i>

16:30.657 --> 16:32.759
<i>There's a problem
with your little girl.</i>

16:32.793 --> 16:35.793
<i>There's a problem
with your little girl.</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:43.168
[Karen]
<i>For this dissertation,</i>

16:43.168 --> 16:45.205
<i>I isolated samples
of my own blood and tissue</i>

16:45.238 --> 16:48.200
<i>to introduce
new genetic material
into a genome.</i>

16:48.200 --> 16:52.000
<i>I successfully integrated
new genes
into my sample's DNA</i>

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
<i>that would have enhanced
everything from muscular
strength to mental acuity.</i>

16:56.000 --> 16:59.653
<i>Thus proving that from cures
for disease to enhancement
of nature,</i>

16:59.653 --> 17:03.000
<i>the power of evolution
is now in our hands.</i>

17:03.000 --> 17:08.000
<i>I submit my experiments
not as an argument for
or against such procedures,</i>

17:08.000 --> 17:10.569
<i>but to help spark
an important ethical debate</i>

17:10.569 --> 17:13.766
<i>about how to utilize
this science to do
the right thing.</i>

17:13.766 --> 17:15.230
[echoing]
<i>The right thing,
the right thing...</i>

17:15.230 --> 17:17.371
<i>A debate we must settle now</i>

17:17.403 --> 17:22.637
<i>before nature or other forces
in our fast-changing world
settle it for us</i>

17:22.637 --> 17:26.000
<i>and for our children.</i>

17:28.315 --> 17:30.615
Attack, my thralls!

17:30.981 --> 17:33.220
[grunting]

17:33.776 --> 17:35.682
-Stop! Fight her control.
-[grunts]

17:36.923 --> 17:38.826
[grunting]

17:42.986 --> 17:44.180
[Gretchen] Fight harder.

17:44.180 --> 17:46.832
You cannot be
so easily defeated.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.432
[both grunting]

17:51.269 --> 17:52.806
You have brainwashed them,

17:52.837 --> 17:56.203
but they cannot match
Atlantean strength and magic.

17:56.203 --> 17:59.105
Then they will die trying,

17:59.105 --> 18:01.531
and so will Mother Box.

18:01.531 --> 18:03.567
Strike, Overlord!

18:03.567 --> 18:05.884
Kill the Mother Box!

18:05.884 --> 18:07.986
[all grunting]

18:13.393 --> 18:17.919
Has anyone heard of this
Infinity Incorporated?

18:17.919 --> 18:19.278
[Violet gasps]

18:19.633 --> 18:21.583
You... You feel that?

18:21.583 --> 18:22.701
Yes.

18:24.355 --> 18:26.022
[whirring]

18:30.284 --> 18:31.809
Vic can boom tube?

18:31.809 --> 18:32.875
Hurry!

18:32.875 --> 18:34.324
Brion, wait!

18:37.451 --> 18:39.787
[all grunting]

18:40.461 --> 18:41.464
[Gretchen grunts]

-Kaldur?
-Mother Box!

18:46.393 --> 18:47.759
[grunting]

18:50.828 --> 18:53.684
Ha! Crush that, magic.

18:53.684 --> 18:55.131
Do not fear, Sister.

18:55.131 --> 18:57.665
I will heal you now.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.511
[chanting in other language]

19:10.000 --> 19:13.131
The tongue of the old gods.

19:15.923 --> 19:17.390
[groaning]

19:17.423 --> 19:18.959
What happened?

19:18.990 --> 19:21.223
-[Aquaman] You were--
-I was being mind-controlled.

19:21.223 --> 19:23.570
-Who did this to you?
-She did.

19:23.570 --> 19:28.914
Garfield, you are long
overdue for discipline.

19:28.914 --> 19:32.414
I'm dropping all of you in...

19:33.971 --> 19:37.971
[Oracle]
<i>Told you I had your back.</i>

19:39.711 --> 19:40.881
[explosion]

19:41.603 --> 19:43.060
Everyone into the boom tube!

19:43.060 --> 19:45.010
-But Gretchen.
-There will be another time.

19:45.010 --> 19:47.778
Yes, run away, children.

19:47.778 --> 19:52.255
Run for your insignificant
little lives.

19:52.255 --> 19:54.567
I had my fun,

19:54.567 --> 19:56.469
and I hope for your sakes

19:56.469 --> 20:00.394
that you all learned a lesson!

20:08.308 --> 20:09.843
[Gretchen shushes]

20:09.875 --> 20:11.943
Hush now.

20:11.979 --> 20:14.548
It's all right.

20:14.578 --> 20:19.546
Everything will be all right.

20:25.692 --> 20:29.601
Everything will be
all right, little girl.

20:29.601 --> 20:32.443
[Malcolm] Yes, it will.

20:36.798 --> 20:41.338
Rhea Malia Beecher Duncan
is off to a fine start.

20:41.374 --> 20:43.576
I'll give you
a little alone time.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.876
Weirdest birth ever.

20:45.913 --> 20:50.548
Karen, you were in there
a long time after
the procedure, baby.

20:50.548 --> 20:52.123
What were you doing?

20:52.123 --> 20:54.748
The right thing
for our daughter.

20:54.748 --> 20:56.827
I did the right thing.

20:58.856 --> 21:00.625
[Dick groaning]

21:04.573 --> 21:05.950
You're all right, Dick.

21:05.950 --> 21:08.500
Take it easy.
Everything will be all right.

21:10.804 --> 21:13.373
[Wyynde] Your friend
is well cared for.

21:13.403 --> 21:15.858
I am sure he will make
a full recovery.

21:15.858 --> 21:18.076
[Aquaman] Yes, I hope so.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.711
I must admit,

21:19.746 --> 21:22.746
I do not see the appeal
of this surface world.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.759
Except that you are here.

21:28.452 --> 21:29.653
[sighs]

21:39.163 --> 21:40.663
I'm sorry.

21:47.951 --> 21:49.713
[beeping]

[theme music playing]

22:08.729 --> 22:10.076
[sucking]

22:59.999 --> 23:02.780
[Gretchen] Good news, sire.

23:02.816 --> 23:09.086
Tonight, I found
the Anti-Life Equation.
