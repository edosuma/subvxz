00:11.360 --> 00:13.040
<i>Previously:</i>
There's been a SARS-like case reported

00:13.120 --> 00:15.480
in Denver Colorado, the local
doctors and public health officials

00:15.560 --> 00:17.040
can't identify the virus.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.120
This is doubled
in just the last two hours.

00:19.900 --> 00:21.120
Can't be...

00:21.300 --> 00:23.080
I went to Nunavut.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.200
There was a body, frozen, buried.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.800
A minor who died of the Spanish Flu

00:27.880 --> 00:31.200
in 1918
and I dug him up without permission.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.560
I took a sample.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.080
I'm really fucked up this time.

00:36.480 --> 00:37.920
Other than
the head trauma

00:37.960 --> 00:40.360
and a few fractured ribs
and some other minor injuries,

00:40.440 --> 00:41.960
very lucky.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.640
What's he doing here?

00:43.680 --> 00:46.720
He gets in a car accident, now he
thinks he let out the Spanish flu.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.685
How did a flu in Nunavut

00:47.786 --> 00:49.800
- end up in Denver, Colorado?
- I don't know.

00:49.880 --> 00:54.120
Beard, accent - Russian or
Polish - mid-sixties.

00:54.200 --> 00:56.640
Look, we drink and we talk.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.528
He says I told him about Nunavut

00:58.740 --> 01:00.440
one night when we got drunk together.

01:01.123 --> 01:03.640
You gave me

01:03.680 --> 01:05.920
the Spanish Flu.

01:05.960 --> 01:08.360
You went and dug up the body,
didn't you?

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074

01:26.360 --> 01:28.500
Not interested.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.660
<i>- It's me, Bob.</i>
- Go home, Bob.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.171
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Just dandy.

01:34.272 --> 01:35.640
<i>Then let me in.</i>

01:35.720 --> 01:37.240
Fuck just go, Bob!

01:39.020 --> 01:41.180
<i>I have to go to the bathroom.</i>

01:51.520 --> 01:53.600
I lied.

01:54.202 --> 01:56.620
David, I was so worried
when you left the lab,

01:57.230 --> 01:58.567
I couldn't work.

02:00.394 --> 02:02.224
- Where are you going?
- Haven't a clue.

02:02.395 --> 02:04.221
Well, how will you know
when you get there?

02:06.070 --> 02:08.460
David, the outbreak in
Denver wasn't your fault.

02:08.741 --> 02:10.821
I got drunk
and told a psychopath

02:11.000 --> 02:14.403
where to find a sample of the Spanish Flu
so he could release it on the public, Bob.

02:14.616 --> 02:17.986
Thirteen people are now
dead because of me, got it?

02:18.405 --> 02:19.881
No. Not because of you.

02:20.106 --> 02:21.757
The Spanish Flu
killed them.

02:22.608 --> 02:23.797
Oh... Fuck it!

02:25.345 --> 02:26.297
Passport.

02:26.466 --> 02:27.313
Wallet.

02:28.839 --> 02:30.974
Lock the door on
your way out, Bob.

02:36.066 --> 02:36.965
Bye.

04:03.883 --> 04:05.756
Episode 2x01 - China

04:07.054 --> 04:08.054
SIX WEEKS LATER

04:08.055 --> 04:09.646
Why do you think
you're here, Ms. Morrison?

04:09.781 --> 04:11.820
- I have no idea.
- There's been a breach of protocol.

04:11.900 --> 04:13.435
I honestly don't know.

04:13.535 --> 04:15.386
This is because David was gone
for a while. He got in contact

04:15.609 --> 04:17.660
with us. Then you were able to find where he was.
- I have no idea.

04:17.740 --> 04:19.651
I'm with Homeland Security,

04:19.933 --> 04:21.257
my name's Agent Smith,

04:21.517 --> 04:23.940
and I want to ask
you a few questions.

04:23.980 --> 04:26.180
What... what
exactly would you like to know?

04:33.220 --> 04:36.300
Carlos Serrano,
I am 39 years old.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.676
I work for NorBAC.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.005
I'm a geneticist and
medical doctor.

04:41.351 --> 04:44.210
I have not spoken
to David in many weeks.

04:44.300 --> 04:47.140
He needed a break.
He was burnt out.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.940
I think he just needed
to get away for some time.

04:49.980 --> 04:51.800
It's appropriate for David

04:51.835 --> 04:53.545
to go somewhere like China.

05:04.554 --> 05:05.460
Smooth.

05:19.802 --> 05:20.949
Did you get that?

05:27.336 --> 05:29.085
All right. All in, all in, all in.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.841
Mayko Tran.
Head of Bio-informatics.

05:37.120 --> 05:39.236
Yeah. He's annoying.
He's stubborn.

05:40.231 --> 05:41.414
He thinks he's the shit

05:41.603 --> 05:44.125
and he doesn't have room
for very many people

05:44.254 --> 05:45.311
and don't get me wrong

05:45.473 --> 05:47.789
there's a fucking
lot to dislike about David...

05:48.279 --> 05:51.858
But, you know, he's got
some really good positives

05:52.150 --> 05:55.534
that sort of...
outweigh the bads.

06:02.461 --> 06:03.532
Jesus!

06:16.608 --> 06:17.859
English?

06:21.712 --> 06:23.350
I'm a fat man.

06:27.077 --> 06:28.812
I'm a fat man.

06:31.813 --> 06:33.402
He says he's Canadian.

06:41.897 --> 06:42.891
Oh, fuck.

06:50.154 --> 06:51.353
My name is Weston Field,

06:51.523 --> 06:53.672
32 years old and
I'm the lab manager here.

06:53.869 --> 06:57.118
I've been getting scattered information.
Bits and pieces.

06:57.418 --> 07:00.478
Nothing that I can form
a cohesive whole out of.

07:00.701 --> 07:03.773
And to be perfectly honest,
I don't know what David's doing in China.

07:03.974 --> 07:05.748
I don't know
when David's coming in.

07:40.825 --> 07:43.511
General Hung.
People's Liberation Army.

07:44.085 --> 07:46.544
Dr. David Sandstrom, NorBAC?

07:46.903 --> 07:49.528
No, Dr. David Sandstrom,
Canadian tourist.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.341
We have a disease outbreak.

07:55.922 --> 07:59.872
Well, I don't do disease
outbreaks anymore, so...

08:01.569 --> 08:02.536
Come.

08:09.858 --> 08:12.118
This is one
of 4 quarantine encampments.

08:12.306 --> 08:14.426
Two more will be
constructed today.

08:14.608 --> 08:16.604
This disease is
out of control.

08:16.794 --> 08:18.606
Began 19 days ago.

08:22.030 --> 08:23.340
Twenty-two dead...

08:23.741 --> 08:24.573
yesterday.

08:25.693 --> 08:27.566
Old, young,

08:29.700 --> 08:31.329
2 in 3 die.

08:50.108 --> 08:52.764
Well, congratulations,
you got yourselves an epidemic.

08:53.592 --> 08:55.302
What does World Health say?

08:56.854 --> 08:59.487
Oh, shit.
You didn't tell them,
did you?

09:00.837 --> 09:02.822
What are you waiting for,
Captain? A million dead?

09:03.042 --> 09:06.223
General,
I am general! Come.

09:11.841 --> 09:12.909
Samples.

09:13.205 --> 09:14.712
From sick dead.

09:15.788 --> 09:18.744
And here, best
scientists in China.

09:19.429 --> 09:22.040
Dr Xue,
Molecular biology.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.356
Dr Zhao, Microbiology.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.209
Dr David Sandstrom.

09:28.046 --> 09:30.427
They have failed
to solve the problem.

09:30.692 --> 09:32.540
You will show them how.

09:32.999 --> 09:36.520
Ah! Dr Liu,
Infectious diseases.

09:36.629 --> 09:38.700
Work hard.
Solve problem.

09:39.929 --> 09:41.195
Excuse me.

09:43.139 --> 09:43.862
Coughing.

09:44.592 --> 09:45.952
Blood in mucus.

09:46.090 --> 09:47.742
We believe lung disease

09:47.843 --> 09:49.277
to be part of disease.

09:49.424 --> 09:51.945
We do blood plates,
we find normal flora.

09:52.029 --> 09:53.931
So we know
which bacteria group,

09:54.414 --> 09:57.312
but cannot identify
specific bacterium.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.540
Why is this outbreak
a secret?

09:59.756 --> 10:01.926
Everything with
Chinese military is a secret.

10:23.459 --> 10:24.103
OK.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.595
Tell me how you're treating it,
what have you tried.

10:27.739 --> 10:28.576
Everything :

10:28.746 --> 10:30.120
Cephalosporin, Quinolone,

10:30.335 --> 10:32.518
Cipro, penicillin.

10:33.111 --> 10:35.259
Combinations of 2
antibiotics, 3 antibiotics.

10:35.479 --> 10:36.586
OK, I get it, I get it.

10:37.666 --> 10:39.853
You've tried everything
that should kill a bacterium,

10:40.019 --> 10:41.865
and nothing did.
Where does that take you?

10:42.252 --> 10:44.579
A super-bacterium?
Drug resistant.

10:46.621 --> 10:49.156
How about,
it's not a bacterium at all.

10:50.847 --> 10:51.661
You know?

10:53.927 --> 10:56.170
It could be any one
of these other things, right?

11:00.019 --> 11:01.523
Except we've tried antivirals,

11:01.718 --> 11:02.810
anti-fungus,

11:02.939 --> 11:04.159
anti-parasites.

11:04.219 --> 11:05.191
Well then,

11:06.164 --> 11:08.559
maybe we need to find out
where it's coming from.

12:08.094 --> 12:09.580
Dr. Liu, ahem...

12:10.144 --> 12:11.662
Sorry, could you...

12:13.422 --> 12:15.880
Hmm, is this what
I think it is?

12:18.856 --> 12:20.155
Scarlet Fever.

12:21.424 --> 12:23.190
This sure as hell isn't a
scarlet fever outbreak.

12:23.359 --> 12:24.508
These people must be
co-infected.

12:24.818 --> 12:27.052
Some have scarlet fever.
Others have TB,

12:27.516 --> 12:29.186
mono, hep. A, hep. B.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.153
We're supposed to figure out
what's making these people sick

12:31.300 --> 12:33.148
when they're sick with
all these other diseases?

12:33.837 --> 12:35.790
Welcome to China,
Dr Sandstrom.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.049
General.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.346
- Yes.
- We got a problem.

12:41.277 --> 12:44.036
All your scientists have gotten
nowhere. I got to the same nowhere.

12:44.242 --> 12:47.469
Now SARS was beaten by all the
labs in the world collaborating.

12:47.870 --> 12:51.785
When China got blamed, SARS
killed more careers than people.

12:52.254 --> 12:53.716
Go back. You can solve it.

12:53.817 --> 12:55.259
You solved Miranda Virus.

12:55.488 --> 12:56.777
No see,
that was a group effort.

12:56.968 --> 12:59.018
The Spanish flu outbreak
in Denver.

12:59.314 --> 13:02.356
That was NorBAC, which is
why we have to contact them.

13:02.599 --> 13:04.654
I promise I won't tell
them where we are.

13:04.763 --> 13:05.583
No, no, no.

13:05.945 --> 13:06.984
General, how can
you speak English

13:07.050 --> 13:09.172
and not understand it?
There's too many complications.

13:09.507 --> 13:12.973
We've got patients with multiple illnesses.
Some of them have got worms and parasites.

13:13.238 --> 13:15.956
There's experts from 3
different countries at NorBAC.

13:16.305 --> 13:18.004
- No, no, no.
- Listen to him. He's right.

13:18.272 --> 13:20.144
Look, I'm gonna make this
perfectly fucking simple

13:20.545 --> 13:22.554
for you, OK? You're on the verge
of a major goddamn epidemic.

13:22.658 --> 13:24.640
If you don't start asking
for more help now,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.473
you are seriously,
seriously fucked!

13:27.008 --> 13:28.619
I am not fucked!

13:29.193 --> 13:30.694
Now, go back work!

13:30.864 --> 13:32.033
Go! Go!

13:34.876 --> 13:35.606
All right.

13:36.722 --> 13:38.486
Nobody knows you're here.

13:41.666 --> 13:43.733
Twenty people a day, die.

13:44.083 --> 13:45.658
What's another dead man?!

13:49.505 --> 13:51.162
Epidemic like this, Hung.

13:51.657 --> 13:54.270
You are looking at one,
two million dead, easy.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.621
You may know science,

13:56.846 --> 13:58.747
but you do not know China.

13:58.748 --> 14:01.489
- No! Don't you have enough dead?
- After him, I'll kill you too!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

14:01.517 --> 14:03.354
- Dead, he will be of no use.
- He can't help us anyway!
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

14:03.389 --> 14:04.190
Ping, stay out of this.

14:14.502 --> 14:15.632
I had to save face,

14:15.780 --> 14:17.346
or he would have shot you.

14:33.303 --> 14:34.235
Any luck on the pathogens?

14:34.428 --> 14:36.912
There are so many bacterial and
viral species in the blood work.

14:37.037 --> 14:39.630
That's where we were hours ago.
We've got to speed this up.

14:40.564 --> 14:41.887
OK, that's it. I want
to contact World Health.

14:42.117 --> 14:44.006
They are the experts on
developing world medicine.

14:44.144 --> 14:45.839
- You can't.
- Would you look around you.

14:45.993 --> 14:47.732
How the hell are we supposed
to solve this on our own.

14:54.101 --> 14:55.932
You're feeling a little better, aren't you?

14:56.833 --> 14:58.192
This is my good friend, La Jiao.

14:58.941 --> 14:59.878
Hello, La Jiao.

15:01.840 --> 15:04.938
His parents died in the
outbreak, and his sister.

15:07.386 --> 15:09.558
Ping. We need help.

15:11.753 --> 15:14.404
This program allows you
to access any computer

15:14.662 --> 15:16.623
- outside the military network.
- Fantastic.

15:16.788 --> 15:19.532
So you can get into
your computer at NorBAC.

15:27.154 --> 15:28.018
Please hurry.

15:29.572 --> 15:30.392
Okay.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.588
Just write what you need to,
we mustn't get caught.

15:33.922 --> 15:35.660
Yeah I don't need
another gun to my head.

15:48.023 --> 15:48.707
<i>Hey Mayko.</i>

15:48.994 --> 15:50.404
Yeah, is there,
like, a logical reason

15:50.628 --> 15:52.655
in the universe for me
to get an e-mail

15:52.956 --> 15:54.644
from David's computer
in Chinese?

15:55.182 --> 15:56.395
I don't know.

15:56.632 --> 15:58.239
<i>OK, well can you look into it?</i>

15:58.451 --> 16:00.362
Sure, I've just got to do
a couple of things for Caroline,

16:00.475 --> 16:01.813
- Forward it to my desk.
<i>- Thanks.</i>

16:16.566 --> 16:18.831
People's Liberation Army
is famous for cuisine.

16:19.171 --> 16:20.041
Really?

16:20.472 --> 16:22.637
Dr Sandstrom,
I hear you in Tokyo.

16:22.679 --> 16:24.750
"Spanish Flu: There will be a sequel."

16:26.021 --> 16:27.201
Yeah, I got
that one right, eh?

16:28.912 --> 16:30.535
Where'd you guys learn
to speak English?

16:30.766 --> 16:32.544
Johns Hopkins
post-doc. Four years.

16:33.096 --> 16:35.421
Mayo clinic.
Two year fellowship.

16:35.999 --> 16:37.371
University of Oxford.

16:37.884 --> 16:39.643
Infectious diseases residency.

16:40.374 --> 16:42.070
Pretty impressive credentials.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.424
But we suck at this outbreak.

16:46.162 --> 16:48.351
Twenty-four
new patients this morning.

16:49.824 --> 16:52.150
And that's just here.

17:19.949 --> 17:22.534
Well, that was the only way
I would do this, small and fast.

17:22.740 --> 17:23.784
I mean, we can be responding

17:23.885 --> 17:26.568
while the big government labs
are still planning their intake meeting.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.227
So how many scientists work here?

17:29.500 --> 17:31.617
Twenty-four PhDs and 30 techies.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.172
David handpicked everyone.

17:33.370 --> 17:35.534
Genomics, proteomics, biotech...

17:36.798 --> 17:38.554
Caroline. Excuse me,

17:38.746 --> 17:40.260
I've got Senator Jackman on line 6.

17:40.482 --> 17:41.895
I'll call back.

17:43.524 --> 17:44.921
This is biochemistry.

17:45.541 --> 17:47.396
Bob Melnikov,
our department chief.

17:47.730 --> 17:50.021
Audrey Graves.
American Drug Industry Council.

17:50.406 --> 17:51.222
Hi.

17:51.432 --> 17:53.000
Bio-informatics is back there.

17:53.210 --> 17:54.441
Can I get you a coffee?

17:54.637 --> 17:57.118
- Yes. Decaf.
- Of course.

17:57.119 --> 17:59.027
So tell me, what areas of research

17:59.128 --> 18:00.773
are you most interested in funding?

18:01.383 --> 18:02.968
Well, Caroline we need to show Congress

18:03.193 --> 18:05.563
that some of our money
is going towards basic research. So...

18:06.038 --> 18:08.149
you tell us how our money
can be best spent.

18:08.472 --> 18:09.961
Oh my God,
do I need a coffee.

18:10.237 --> 18:10.949
Ahem!

18:12.901 --> 18:14.234
Oh sorry... Shit...

18:14.851 --> 18:16.404
I mean, excuse me.

18:16.973 --> 18:18.990
I've been up working all night.
Not complaining,

18:19.302 --> 18:21.243
just not functioning.
Hi, Mayko Tran.

18:21.780 --> 18:22.446
Pleasure.

18:23.241 --> 18:26.299
Carlos, I'd like
you to meet Audrey Graves.

18:27.008 --> 18:28.669
American Drug Industry Council.

18:28.939 --> 18:30.541
Carlos Serrano,
our chief geneticist.

18:31.006 --> 18:32.427
You're in Toronto
for the AIDS conference?

18:32.638 --> 18:34.552
- I'll be speaking
- About Africa?

18:34.802 --> 18:37.345
- Yes.
- Then I will be listening.

18:39.679 --> 18:41.588
How's David Sandstrom's recuperation?

18:41.720 --> 18:42.852
It's going great.

18:43.363 --> 18:46.385
- I found bacterium in water.
- What kind of bacterium?

18:46.865 --> 18:49.611
Same as in blood of sick people.
Cannot identify.

18:49.889 --> 18:51.590
- Antibiotic resistant?
- Yes. The same.

18:53.279 --> 18:54.231
Here's our guy.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.521
OK, morphology?

19:01.177 --> 19:03.590
Right water.
Left, from patient.

19:03.759 --> 19:05.256
Like the Olsen twins, don't they?

19:06.009 --> 19:06.854
The DNA gels.

19:08.325 --> 19:09.533
Tell me about the water around here.

19:09.709 --> 19:12.940
Water from lake, rivers and wells.

19:13.043 --> 19:13.862
It doesn't make any sense.

19:14.146 --> 19:16.169
Why would you find a drug-resistant
bacteria in lake and well water?

19:16.416 --> 19:18.091
The only bacteria
that are drug resistant

19:18.297 --> 19:20.579
develop in hospitals. MRSA. C-difficile.

19:20.683 --> 19:22.899
Exactly, we need to sequence
a gene or 2 for each sample.

19:24.090 --> 19:25.946
We already got the genomic
sequence from Beijing.

19:26.828 --> 19:28.931
OK, what's this? I mean
where's the analysis I can't--

19:29.146 --> 19:32.112
- General Hung won't let--
- No, look. We need a bioinformatician, okay?

19:32.193 --> 19:33.965
Mayko Tran is
the very best I've ever seen.

19:45.340 --> 19:47.471
Satellite phone.
Hung will kill us if he finds out.

19:48.243 --> 19:49.719
One phone call for one watch.

19:53.319 --> 19:54.174
Only 3 minutes.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.504
I'll barely have enough
time to send all the data.

20:01.611 --> 20:04.323
- Cappuccino.
- Wow, thank you. Carlos?

20:08.767 --> 20:09.978
Check this.

20:11.214 --> 20:13.381
It's coming in at 2,400 bps,

20:13.619 --> 20:15.577
but everyone streams at 45,000.

20:16.426 --> 20:18.745
One of your lunatic
friends at sciencesucks.com.

20:18.956 --> 20:21.045
No, hackers don't use
15 year old modems, Carlos.

20:22.232 --> 20:23.607
Is it Chinese or Japanese?

20:23.947 --> 20:24.862
Chinese.

20:25.877 --> 20:27.160
Oh, shit, interrupting.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.995
OK, I don't know if
this is a coincidence,

20:31.309 --> 20:34.839
but this came in on the tip line.
It was sent from David's computer.

20:35.073 --> 20:36.658
David's?
What do you mean?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.642
Well, I mean it came
from David's computer.

20:39.011 --> 20:40.524
I don't know what's going on.

20:44.050 --> 20:45.674
It was all in gibberish,
even in Chinese.

20:45.880 --> 20:46.979
This is what it says :

20:47.226 --> 20:49.726
Held by PLA. Outbreak.

20:49.994 --> 20:52.356
Many dead.
I need help. Are you there?

20:52.545 --> 20:54.378
I'll get in touch with the
Canadian Ambassador of China.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.671
I'm on the e-mail address.

20:58.098 --> 20:59.552
- Is David Okay?
- He's fine, Bob.

20:59.653 --> 21:00.695
How do you know?

21:02.285 --> 21:03.622
Because I know David.

21:07.249 --> 21:08.998
OK, it got interrupted

21:09.965 --> 21:11.006
right here.

21:11.351 --> 21:12.886
It came in at 2,400 bps.

21:13.133 --> 21:15.217
Satellite phones
transfer at 2,400 bps.

21:15.900 --> 21:16.598
OK. Wes?

21:18.704 --> 21:20.365
Try to trace this transmission
if you could.

21:20.783 --> 21:22.102
He said something
about an outbreak.

21:22.485 --> 21:23.983
We only got part
of the information.

21:24.218 --> 21:25.829
- I'm doing database searches to ID it.
- Okay.

21:26.178 --> 21:28.118
Beijing line 6. Canadian ambassador,

21:28.424 --> 21:29.541
her name is Lise Goyer.

21:32.478 --> 21:34.082
Mrs. Goyer, good evening.

21:34.615 --> 21:36.450
We lost a Canadian citizen.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.481
He's the head scientist at NorBAC, yes.

21:46.732 --> 21:48.437
Because I know David.

21:51.837 --> 21:53.989
OK, it got interrupted...

21:56.174 --> 21:56.755
Hi!

21:58.986 --> 21:59.643
Hi, Jill.

21:59.788 --> 22:01.501
Dr. Melnikov, you look fabulous.

22:02.579 --> 22:03.632
Come here.

22:05.947 --> 22:07.091
- Welcome home, Jill.
- Thank you.

22:07.406 --> 22:08.959
- How was Oxford?
- It was good. It was good.

22:09.179 --> 22:10.294
I missed you, though.

22:10.294 --> 22:11.841
How are things
going around here?

22:12.161 --> 22:14.189
I don't know.
Something's going on.

22:15.044 --> 22:15.972
Something with David.

22:16.107 --> 22:17.523
- Where is he?
- China.

22:17.925 --> 22:18.922
What? Why?

22:19.190 --> 22:20.214
I don't know.

22:21.272 --> 22:23.220
Hmm.
Well let's go find out.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.127
We hear nothing from David for 6 weeks

22:26.347 --> 22:28.970
and now it looks like I'm going to
have to save him from the Chinese Army.

22:29.577 --> 22:30.928
Nothing ever changes, does it?

22:31.498 --> 22:33.461
- Hello, welcome back.
- Thank you.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.672
So the word in the U.K. is that

22:36.180 --> 22:37.827
NorBAC stopped the Spanish Flu in Denver.

22:39.360 --> 22:40.048
We did.

22:41.285 --> 22:42.870
- But David started it.
- Jill...

22:44.067 --> 22:45.137
welcome back.

22:47.738 --> 22:48.979
So what's he into this time?

22:49.964 --> 22:51.128
I'll explain.

22:51.664 --> 22:53.806
I've got to figure out a genome,
I think it's bacteria.

22:54.052 --> 22:56.029
Are you too jetlagged
or can you pitch in?

22:56.212 --> 22:57.180
Oh, no, no. I'm in.

22:57.652 --> 22:59.400
Yeah, send me a copy.
I've just got to caffeine up.

23:04.228 --> 23:05.328
This just got here.

23:09.581 --> 23:10.788
So the data stream from David

23:10.984 --> 23:13.209
didn't come from one
of the global sat. systems.

23:13.645 --> 23:14.762
Chinese military.

23:15.371 --> 23:16.466
Nice work.

23:17.536 --> 23:19.078
- I'll get through to David.
- Okay.

23:34.645 --> 23:35.604
Connor McGuinn.

23:35.793 --> 23:36.963
<i>Connor, it's Caroline.</i>

23:37.554 --> 23:38.911
Hey, Caroline, how's it going?

23:39.295 --> 23:40.608
<i>We heard from David.</i>

23:40.829 --> 23:43.656
Yeah? That's good news.
Is he coming back?

23:44.096 --> 23:45.237
<i>I'm sure he will.</i>

23:45.581 --> 23:47.921
We got a call,
we think it may have come

23:48.222 --> 23:49.641
from a PLA sat. phone.

23:51.235 --> 23:52.832
Got friends in the
Chinese Army, Caroline?

23:53.868 --> 23:54.964
Just one.

24:18.753 --> 24:20.118
What am I looking at?

24:35.523 --> 24:37.193
We're going to figure this out.

24:37.467 --> 24:39.901
Come on. We'll figure this out.

24:42.953 --> 24:45.465
Well, there's some really
weird klebsiella kinda thing.

24:45.915 --> 24:47.066
A bacterium.

24:47.642 --> 24:48.650
Yeah. Klebs in your colon.

24:48.889 --> 24:50.726
It's crucial to natural body functions,

24:50.954 --> 24:52.470
but if ingested or inhaled...

24:55.202 --> 24:56.618
klebsiella can kill you.

24:57.028 --> 24:58.415
- So maybe that's it?
- Or not.

24:58.814 --> 25:00.814
I also found bacillus cereus DNA.

25:01.363 --> 25:02.740
Food poisoning's not a killer.

25:03.122 --> 25:04.535
That's a weird combination.

25:04.970 --> 25:06.595
Yeah, I'm thinking they
were trying to sequence

25:06.724 --> 25:09.251
- 1 organism but got 2 by mistake.
- That happens.

25:09.534 --> 25:12.239
Or this could all be one
big transmission screw-up,

25:12.449 --> 25:14.134
because I also found one gene
that repeats itself

25:14.403 --> 25:16.001
over and over again 100 times.

25:16.486 --> 25:17.283
Like in cancer.

25:18.102 --> 25:20.109
- But this isn't cancer.
- No.

25:21.130 --> 25:24.437
OK, so a bacterium has about
four thousand genes, right?

25:25.958 --> 25:27.719
And David sent us about a third?

25:28.751 --> 25:30.336
Can we do anything?

25:30.791 --> 25:33.236
Well if this is a freak
combination of bacteria,

25:33.495 --> 25:35.489
I wouldn't mind trying
to figure out how it happened.

25:35.966 --> 25:37.650
And see if we can't
find out what's missing.

25:38.991 --> 25:40.214
I'll help.

25:46.298 --> 25:47.667
Have you tried doxycycline?

25:49.696 --> 25:50.790
What's left?

25:52.203 --> 25:54.220
I've been trying some new anti-microbials

25:54.516 --> 25:55.953
we just got from Beijing.

25:57.680 --> 25:59.319
He's got a wife and daughter.

26:00.506 --> 26:01.954
I can't even make a phone call

26:02.212 --> 26:03.865
to let them know he's dying.

26:04.364 --> 26:06.021
Is there anything else
new I should know about?

26:06.425 --> 26:09.342
It's growing, we're getting more
and more sick people every day.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.593
And from farther afield.

26:12.735 --> 26:15.198
Still, when I first came here,
I thought this would spread a lot quicker.

26:15.530 --> 26:17.115
This isn't the only
hospital camp, David.

26:17.561 --> 26:19.480
There are now 12 others,
and hundreds are dying.

26:19.754 --> 26:22.919
Oh fuck, what are we doing wrong?
Why can't we figure this out?

26:38.436 --> 26:40.143
Why 1 in 3? What are we missing?

26:43.635 --> 26:44.861
Hello La Jiao.

26:47.401 --> 26:48.423
David.

26:48.981 --> 26:49.846
Da-wid.

26:50.583 --> 26:51.276
Daaa-vid.

26:52.869 --> 26:53.810
Daaa-wiiid.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.417
Excellent. Excellent.

27:17.815 --> 27:20.826
The 16 S ribosomal DNA seems
to fit in there.

27:21.222 --> 27:23.152
Granulomatous over there.

27:24.822 --> 27:25.691
Citrobacter.

27:26.307 --> 27:27.559
Older, yeah. Right there.

27:28.762 --> 27:30.178
Is this making any sense?

27:30.283 --> 27:32.194
It would help if
we had all of its genes.

27:32.345 --> 27:34.905
It's a big puzzle with most
of the pieces missing, right?

27:35.344 --> 27:36.641
Well what are we missing?

28:01.189 --> 28:02.291
Hey Bob, what you doing?

28:03.719 --> 28:04.664
Reduces fatigue,

28:05.095 --> 28:06.515
it sparks creativity.

28:08.599 --> 28:09.159
Oh.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.039
Yeah. Okay.

28:15.316 --> 28:16.634
Mayko's got something.

28:18.045 --> 28:19.301
OK, so there.

28:19.484 --> 28:21.051
Right there,
that's a splice. Right.

28:21.069 --> 28:23.512
So that's klebsiella and
that's the bacillus cereus.

28:24.373 --> 28:25.493
So it's not a mistake.

28:25.671 --> 28:28.364
Oh, no. It's a mistake,
only it's nature's.

28:30.142 --> 28:31.151
And the repeating gene?

28:31.502 --> 28:32.452
I'm still working on it.

28:33.639 --> 28:36.617
- Hmm, OK. Thank you.
- Okay.

28:46.446 --> 28:47.608
OK, so Mayko says...

28:49.043 --> 28:51.240
Bob. Bob.

28:54.178 --> 28:55.376
Look at it upside down.

28:56.538 --> 28:58.008
What if it belongs like that?

28:59.936 --> 29:02.074
See the top is
at the bottom.

29:03.854 --> 29:05.328
We're trying to see how it evolved.

29:05.822 --> 29:07.754
But it's not a leaf. It's a root.

29:08.563 --> 29:11.881
It's not new, it's ancient.

29:13.217 --> 29:14.921
That's why
we can't see how it evolved.

29:15.445 --> 29:18.898
It didn't.
Everything evolved from it.

29:33.836 --> 29:35.227
He was right.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.662
We suck at this outbreak.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.469
OK, we're getting somewhere.

29:53.703 --> 29:55.643
- It's old klebsiella.
- Old?

29:55.773 --> 29:57.001
Very old.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.973
Caroline. Sorry.
Connor McGuinn, line 1.

30:03.463 --> 30:04.563
<i>Hey Connor.</i>

30:04.883 --> 30:06.438
That number you wanted...

30:06.718 --> 30:08.763
Pretty interesting,
Caroline, what's going on?

30:09.123 --> 30:10.158
<i>What do you mean?</i>

30:11.288 --> 30:14.322
Just let me know
how that call turns out.

30:23.935 --> 30:25.737
General Hung on the phone.

30:26.415 --> 30:28.594
Hello, I'm Caroline Morrison
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

30:28.917 --> 30:30.660
from NorBAC in Canada.
<i> </i>
<i> </i>
<i> </i>

30:38.960 --> 30:40.944
Dr David Sandstrom,

30:42.504 --> 30:44.954
Madame Caroline Morrison, NorBAC.

30:49.479 --> 30:51.004
- Hello.
<i>- David?</i>

30:51.401 --> 30:52.653
Caroline, what a surprise.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.174
- David we're all here.
- Yeah. Are you okay?

30:55.275 --> 30:56.836
Where are you exactly?

30:57.871 --> 30:59.329
Sorry Morrison.
That's classified.

31:00.264 --> 31:02.369
<i>- Any idea what this bacterium is?</i>
- It's a freak.

31:02.919 --> 31:05.459
It's got pieces of bacillus
cereus and an old klebsiella.

31:06.189 --> 31:07.694
- David.
<i>- Hey Bob!</i>

31:08.184 --> 31:10.639
It's like the great
grandfather of today's klebsiella.

31:10.929 --> 31:13.414
- Why is it drug resistant?
- Ahem, not a clue.

31:13.489 --> 31:15.789
Any idea how it's getting
around our natural defenses?

31:15.999 --> 31:17.704
Well this species predates
human life in China.

31:18.294 --> 31:20.339
So our bodies
would have no memory of it.

31:20.979 --> 31:24.194
The receptors in the white blood
cells don't recognize it as dangerous.

31:25.084 --> 31:28.169
David, it's got over a
hundred repetitions of one gene.

31:28.489 --> 31:30.069
Really, why?

31:30.259 --> 31:31.389
Don't know yet.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.320
How many dead, David?

31:36.961 --> 31:38.072
Fourteen hundred.

31:40.203 --> 31:42.079
David, where are you exactly?
We need to alert--

31:44.514 --> 31:46.582
What's the rush General?
It's their nickel.

31:47.015 --> 31:48.344
Explain.

31:49.368 --> 31:51.929
How 2 bacteria mix?

31:52.652 --> 31:53.994
Horizontal transfer.

31:54.191 --> 31:56.968
Which is a fancy way of saying the
bacteria were promiscuous little bastards.

31:57.175 --> 31:58.705
They trade genetic
material all the time.

31:58.890 --> 32:00.244
Even in cross-species barriers.

32:02.770 --> 32:04.264
OK, really simple.

32:05.251 --> 32:06.891
Let's say I had a bact...

32:08.673 --> 32:10.914
Let's say I have a bacterium.

32:11.447 --> 32:12.671
We'll call him David.

32:12.977 --> 32:15.115
And David is a happy little bacterium

32:15.375 --> 32:16.646
he's just bopping along through life

32:16.831 --> 32:19.047
until he runs into a nasty
piece of work called Hung.

32:19.582 --> 32:21.180
They trade DNA,

32:21.507 --> 32:24.373
and now, even though they look like
they're the same bacterium,

32:24.920 --> 32:27.242
they're actually 2 new species.

32:27.548 --> 32:29.721
Havid and Dung.

32:30.332 --> 32:33.355
So Havid, he gets into your body,
but your body doesn't recognize him

32:33.475 --> 32:35.801
as being bad,
because he still looks like David.

32:36.271 --> 32:37.655
And Havid divides every 20 minutes.

32:37.895 --> 32:39.644
And after a day
there's 10 million Havids

32:39.862 --> 32:41.718
and another 8 hours
there's 83 trillion.

32:41.971 --> 32:43.637
And because
of what he got from Hung,

32:43.960 --> 32:45.973
all those Havids are pricks

32:46.184 --> 32:47.864
and they're trying to kill you.
The End.

32:48.623 --> 32:49.992
We send a sample to NorBAC,

32:50.070 --> 32:52.283
they help us figure out
how to fucking kill it

32:52.517 --> 32:54.150
and we all live happily ever after.

32:56.580 --> 32:58.760
Oh Jesus.

33:05.170 --> 33:07.549
Ah, Caroline! I'm going back
to the AIDS conference.

33:07.611 --> 33:08.652
Are you still
interested in coming?

33:08.889 --> 33:11.064
Yeah, later, I just want
to stay on this China thing.

33:11.559 --> 33:12.603
Mmm. Anything new or...

33:13.135 --> 33:14.949
I'm not sure. We did
make contact with David,

33:15.147 --> 33:17.248
- I just want to stay on it.
- Of course.

33:17.496 --> 33:18.999
I'll catch up with you
later for Audrey's speech.

33:19.224 --> 33:19.926
Absolutely.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.800
It's a hybrid of klebsiella and
bacillus cereus.

33:23.880 --> 33:26.440
Those bacteria are
not drug resistant.

33:26.480 --> 33:30.234
Right. Antibiotics should be
killing them, but they're not.

33:30.269 --> 33:31.600
There's something else.

33:31.680 --> 33:34.000
They found a gene that
repeats 100 times.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.600
- What's it for?
- They don't know yet.

33:36.680 --> 33:38.800
Could be 100 flagella,
a 100 cell membranes,

33:38.880 --> 33:40.800
100 noses.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.200
These are simple bacteria,
simple cells.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.240
What do they need 100
of anything for?

33:48.680 --> 33:49.880
Hey, who let you out?

33:53.080 --> 33:55.720
I get camera.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.440
Have a seat.

34:03.700 --> 34:05.760
- Carlos Serrano, NorBAC.
- Sean Macpherson.

34:05.900 --> 34:07.113
You're an AIDS doctor?

34:07.214 --> 34:09.100
I was.
Now I just do science.

34:09.980 --> 34:11.237
I just got back from Malawi.

34:11.505 --> 34:13.915
I worked in an MSF camp,
near Lilongwe.

34:14.221 --> 34:17.070
I was there about 3 or 4 months ago.
Volunteering at an AIDS orphanage in Mizuzu.

34:17.277 --> 34:18.431
- That's tough.
- Yeah.

34:18.630 --> 34:20.270
A lot of kids.
Really alone.

34:21.971 --> 34:24.679
What do you think about handing
out syringes and condoms to addicts?

34:25.329 --> 34:26.944
It seems to be working in the US.

34:27.199 --> 34:30.693
The HIV/AIDS incidence rate has been
slowly decreasing in the IDU population

34:30.976 --> 34:32.686
since the 1980's.

34:32.951 --> 34:34.406
The operative word is slowly.

34:34.938 --> 34:37.054
- Better than not at all.
- Yeah.

34:38.360 --> 34:39.234
It's Stephen Lewis.

34:39.427 --> 34:40.728
Ever hear him talk?

34:41.092 --> 34:43.203
- Not in person.
- Wanna go?

34:44.045 --> 34:44.792
Let's go.

34:45.900 --> 34:49.679
<i>... the pandemic has
such an irreversible grip.</i>

34:49.820 --> 34:52.320
<i>It is simply beyond belief.</i>

34:56.871 --> 34:59.383
So, when we're done here,

34:59.798 --> 35:01.424
where are you off to?

35:02.557 --> 35:04.700
Maybe my lab, back in Beijing.

35:05.441 --> 35:07.367
And you? Back to NorBAC?

35:07.681 --> 35:09.391
I don't think I can, really.

35:10.016 --> 35:11.303
Why not?

35:13.250 --> 35:16.225
I did something,
and a lot of people...

35:17.932 --> 35:19.651
You know what, it's a long story.

35:24.214 --> 35:27.543
I was a first year student at
Beijing University.

35:28.050 --> 35:31.795
One day I asked 5 of my friends
to join a protest.

35:32.811 --> 35:34.278
We rode on our bicycles

35:34.925 --> 35:37.493
and we demanded
freedom of speech,

35:38.088 --> 35:39.659
and an end to corruption,

35:40.423 --> 35:42.884
and we felt like we were
making something good happen.

35:44.353 --> 35:47.630
But then 3 of
my friends died, instead.

35:48.754 --> 35:50.374
Tiananmen Square?

35:51.217 --> 35:52.587
I'm sorry.

35:54.234 --> 35:57.320
I spent 6 months
sleeping and crying

35:57.400 --> 36:00.000
until I realized

36:00.080 --> 36:02.387
I didn't have to act dead

36:02.759 --> 36:05.040
just because my friends were.

36:49.967 --> 36:51.080
Stop. Forget it.

36:51.765 --> 36:54.219
No antibiotics are going
to work. Here's why.

36:55.159 --> 36:58.144
Here's our klebsiella/bacillus
cereus hybrid.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.542
Those 100 repeating genes:

37:01.029 --> 37:02.806
membrane pumps.

37:03.148 --> 37:04.395
Membrane is porous.

37:04.696 --> 37:05.982
So whatever gets into the bacterium,

37:06.184 --> 37:08.193
if the bacterium doesn't like it
just pumps them right out.

37:08.445 --> 37:09.689
But why would it need 100 pumps?

37:09.933 --> 37:13.202
Because it must be living somewhere
with lots of things it doesn't like.

37:13.452 --> 37:15.980
Exactly. Some place with
a lot of salt or chemicals,

37:16.210 --> 37:18.505
but this bacteria is amazing
at spitting things out.

37:18.787 --> 37:21.302
- Like antibiotics.
- And so it's drug resistant.

37:21.446 --> 37:23.399
And it's ancient.
It's probably been disturbed

37:23.597 --> 37:26.366
so tell Hung he's got to look for it in some
shithole of a place full of, I don't know,

37:26.562 --> 37:28.538
tar or acid.

37:28.839 --> 37:31.305
- Probably someplace underground.
- Right.

37:35.554 --> 37:37.310
So where are we now?

37:38.321 --> 37:41.399
Well, now we know
no drugs can kill it,

37:41.752 --> 37:43.411
so there's not much left.

37:43.645 --> 37:45.770
What does La Jiao have
that Dr Zhao did not?

37:45.980 --> 37:48.633
How can La Jiao's body fight klebsiella

37:48.851 --> 37:50.980
when two-thirds can't?

37:53.441 --> 37:54.945
Maybe... maybe,

37:55.310 --> 37:58.111
it's not the klebsiella
he fights.

38:01.022 --> 38:02.537
It's the bacillus cereus.

38:03.196 --> 38:04.617
He must have been exposed to it once

38:04.801 --> 38:06.343
and now he has the antibodies to kill it.

38:06.571 --> 38:09.828
- And when he kills the bacillus cereus...
- He kills the klebsiella.

38:14.040 --> 38:16.325
Uh, bacillus cereus.

38:16.739 --> 38:19.191
It's a bacterium that
causes food poisoning in rice.

38:19.432 --> 38:21.260
You know, vomiting,
diarrhea that sort of thing.

38:21.343 --> 38:23.169
But the thing is,
our bodies can beat it.

38:23.708 --> 38:25.661
We think people who have
had it are the same people

38:25.908 --> 38:28.460
who survived
the hybrid klebsiella we found.

38:28.698 --> 38:29.671
Why?

38:29.903 --> 38:31.749
Horizontal transfer.
Havid and Dung.

38:32.050 --> 38:34.882
See klebsiella, it picked up
some bacillus cereus DNA.

38:35.170 --> 38:37.562
So anyone who has had
a bacillus cereus infection

38:37.687 --> 38:39.089
will probably develop
an immunity.

38:39.728 --> 38:42.887
Because body knows
it's bad and kills it.

38:43.116 --> 38:45.267
Yeah, so in theory, we inject people with
bacillus cereus

38:45.368 --> 38:47.748
they get sick, they recover,
their bodies can fight it.

38:49.357 --> 38:51.050
Clever. Clever!

38:51.739 --> 38:54.830
She nailed it.
We need some guinea pigs.

38:55.470 --> 38:57.284
We need mammals.
To test our hypothesis.

38:57.549 --> 38:59.328
First we give them the food poisoning,

38:59.560 --> 39:01.551
and then the bacterium that's
causing the outbreak.

39:01.992 --> 39:03.874
I will give you
human mammals.

39:05.307 --> 39:06.782
Uh... General, I don't
think so. General!

39:07.030 --> 39:08.916
General! general!

39:09.612 --> 39:12.065
General, you can't try this on
people until we know it works.

39:12.212 --> 39:14.635
People die more and more.
I cannot wait.

39:14.701 --> 39:16.100
Well what are you going to do
grab somebody off the street

39:16.329 --> 39:17.428
and load them up with
bacillus cereus?

39:17.643 --> 39:20.250
- I do not see volunteers.
- General, I volunteer.

39:20.739 --> 39:22.820
- Good!
- No, no... Don't even go there.

39:29.439 --> 39:30.605
Wait, wait.
What are you saying?

39:32.425 --> 39:33.514
This is my choice.

39:33.937 --> 39:36.686
I don't care. Ping, if we're wrong
you've got a two in three chance of dying.

39:36.730 --> 39:38.628
How can we be wrong?

39:40.316 --> 39:41.456
Don't do this.

39:42.665 --> 39:45.598
David, if it was your country,
you would do the same.

39:48.189 --> 39:49.331
Doctor...

39:51.345 --> 39:52.752
...thank you for
your assistance.

39:53.062 --> 39:55.188
No, no, Hung.
I'm not finished here yet.
David...

39:55.589 --> 39:57.051
Go home.

40:47.444 --> 40:50.253
Ms. Graves, can you tell us what
the American Pharmaceutical Council

40:50.445 --> 40:51.765
is doing on the issue of AIDS?

40:51.980 --> 40:55.514
Well, we have for the first time over
one hundred new AIDS drugs in development.

40:55.575 --> 40:58.067
We are on the verge of a new
generation of AIDS medicine.

40:58.283 --> 41:01.417
Injectable fusion inhibitors,
gene therapy, inhibitory RNA...

41:01.736 --> 41:04.278
- Are any pediatric drugs?
- Of course.

41:04.465 --> 41:05.556
How many?

41:06.482 --> 41:08.152
- I don't have that exact number.
- None.

41:09.159 --> 41:10.974
Half a million kids die in Africa each year

41:10.975 --> 41:12.081
and you do no research whatsoever.

41:12.351 --> 41:14.695
Cause only a handful of kids
in the West get AIDS.

41:14.884 --> 41:17.292
- You make drugs for markets not people.
- What about patents?

41:18.125 --> 41:21.337
We have given up our rights
for patents in Africa.

41:21.535 --> 41:24.007
That's not the issue.
African kids are given adult drugs.

41:24.276 --> 41:26.376
No one knows the proper dosage.
They're told to cut them up.

41:26.743 --> 41:29.471
Sometimes the active ingredient isn't even
spread out in the pill. It is a nightmare.

41:30.701 --> 41:31.903
Hey, I have a question for you.

41:31.904 --> 41:33.989
How come there are
hundreds of anti-depressants

41:34.263 --> 41:36.573
but not one pill for kids with AIDS?

41:38.750 --> 41:39.951
- Listen to me.
- Sean!

41:40.103 --> 41:43.920
This has AIDS.
It's from Africa. It's a new strain.

41:44.870 --> 41:47.097
Children are dying. Fourteen
hundred a day, every day.

41:47.323 --> 41:50.114
Four million Africans go without
any treatment whatsoever.

41:50.292 --> 41:52.232
They won't even see the drugs
you're talking about.

41:52.425 --> 41:54.887
Besides, drugs are useless if there
are no doctors to prescribe them.

41:55.076 --> 41:57.317
They're useless if
children are going hungry.

41:57.488 --> 41:58.604
Police! Don't move!

41:59.126 --> 42:00.170
Sean! Sean!

42:14.961 --> 42:17.828
Carlos, what do I do?
Pull it out.

42:31.385 --> 42:32.922
<i>Next on ReGenesis</i>

42:33.562 --> 42:35.273
Are you having a boy or a girl?

42:35.462 --> 42:36.741
Boy or girl?

42:37.185 --> 42:38.347
Why are we doing this?

42:38.702 --> 42:42.092
Audrey Graves has given us
35 million dollars for research.

42:43.065 --> 42:44.481
I had to leave Africa.

42:45.002 --> 42:48.054
We're trying to trace back the
strain to Patient Zero.

42:48.476 --> 42:50.638
- Simon Jessup.
- You know I've read about a British neuroscientist

42:51.102 --> 42:53.355
who's been working with people
exposed to Mad Cow.

42:53.548 --> 42:55.529
He's developing out there
tests with MRIs.

42:57.730 --> 42:58.906
Nobody knows I quit.

42:59.170 --> 43:00.655
NorBAC would have been finished.

43:00.894 --> 43:02.794
What were you going to do
if I didn't come back?

43:03.643 --> 43:04.784
You did.
