WEBVTT

00:01.834 --> 00:04.268
Good night.
Good night.

00:04.269 --> 00:07.705
Tim, maybe we can get
a head start on that shed
over the weekend.

00:07.707 --> 00:11.309
Ooh, no can do, al.
This weekend, after two years,

00:11.310 --> 00:14.846
I'm finally putting the soul
in the beast.

00:14.847 --> 00:17.749
I'm dumping that big 350 chevy
engine in my hot rod.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.150
Really?
Yeah.

00:19.151 --> 00:21.786
Well, that would be hard
to do by yourself.

00:21.787 --> 00:23.955
That's why I got a couple
of guys coming over.

00:23.956 --> 00:26.691
A little work party,
a celebration of man
and machine.

00:26.692 --> 00:30.095
<i>(grunts)</i>
oh, a lot of guys
coming over?

00:30.096 --> 00:32.430
Just some friends.
Oh.

00:34.399 --> 00:37.201
Al, I would have asked you,
but I thought

00:37.202 --> 00:40.705
You'd be with greta
at that big linoleum exhibit.

00:42.541 --> 00:45.543
Well, uh, I told greta

00:45.544 --> 00:48.079
That I didn't want
to be tied down.

00:48.080 --> 00:51.082
And, you know, we just...
We both thought

00:51.083 --> 00:54.886
That it was best
to explore other options.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.221
She dumped you, huh?
Yeah.

00:57.222 --> 01:00.491
Well, have a good weekend, tim.

01:04.830 --> 01:06.865
Hey, al.
You know, we probably
could use another hand

01:06.866 --> 01:08.833
Dropping that engine in,
if you're free.

01:08.834 --> 01:10.769
Completely free!

01:12.337 --> 01:14.873
I love parties!
Is there a theme?

01:17.476 --> 01:20.011
A theme?

01:20.012 --> 01:22.881
Yeah, we're doing the wild west.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.851
I could bring jerky.

01:26.852 --> 01:29.554
They say you are
what you eat, al.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.992
Well, what do you think?
Can we put the kids
in the middle?

02:44.863 --> 02:46.264
So, what about an old movie?

02:46.265 --> 02:48.699
We got <i>a man and a woman</i>
here at the berkeley.

02:48.700 --> 02:52.203
No, nothing romantic.
The way I'm feeling about men,

02:52.204 --> 02:55.806
I want to see something
with "chain saw" in the title.

02:55.807 --> 02:59.277
Aw, karen, man trouble?

02:59.278 --> 03:00.678
I don't understand
what happened.

03:00.679 --> 03:03.814
You told me that you and greg
were doing so well.

03:03.815 --> 03:06.951
Well, I thought we were.
But then he said something

03:06.952 --> 03:09.687
About maybe we should think
about seeing other people.

03:09.688 --> 03:11.256
And we all know
what that means.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.391
Yeah. It means he already is.

03:15.327 --> 03:19.464
Yeah, well, you know what?
I'm fed up and I'm through
with men.

03:19.465 --> 03:23.501
On behalf of all men,
I'd like to say thank you.

03:23.502 --> 03:25.370
Jerk!
Doo-doo heads!

03:25.371 --> 03:27.472
Punks!
Randy, where are
your shoes?

03:27.473 --> 03:30.741
They're up in a tree.
Shut up.

03:30.742 --> 03:33.244
Wait, wait, wait...
Randy I just bought
those shoes.

03:33.245 --> 03:36.548
Why are they up in a tree?

03:36.549 --> 03:39.016
Paul and vinnie mcgurn.
They jumped him.

03:39.017 --> 03:41.452
Oh, not again. Come on.
This has gotta stop.

03:41.453 --> 03:43.754
You guys gotta make friends
with those boys.

03:43.755 --> 03:46.291
Have them over for lunch.
<i>(laughing)</i> yeah, right.

03:47.859 --> 03:52.197
Dad said to pick the biggest one
and pound him into the ground.

03:52.198 --> 03:55.233
Only if the lunch thing
didn't work out.

03:57.169 --> 03:59.637
You never said that!
No pounding!

03:59.638 --> 04:01.172
Dad...
No.

04:01.173 --> 04:02.507
I'd like to sit
and chat with you women,

04:02.508 --> 04:05.376
But I gotta go pray to chevy,
the combustion god.

04:05.377 --> 04:07.712
<i>(grunts)</i>

04:07.713 --> 04:09.847
When dave shows up,
tell him I'm out in the garage.

04:09.848 --> 04:12.116
Ok. Dave gibbons?
Is he coming over?

04:12.117 --> 04:13.851
Yeah!

04:13.852 --> 04:16.153
Karen, have you
ever met him?
No, no, no.

04:16.154 --> 04:18.690
No, no, no. No!

04:18.690 --> 04:22.026
I need him
in the garage, please?
I just want to introduce them.

04:22.027 --> 04:23.761
What happened to this romantic
chain saw movie you're going to?

04:23.762 --> 04:26.030
No. Jill, please.
The last thing I want

04:26.031 --> 04:28.132
Is to get fixed up
with another guy.

04:28.133 --> 04:30.501
Thank you.
Is he cute?

04:30.502 --> 04:33.204
He is adorable.
And he's very sensitive.

04:33.205 --> 04:36.574
Dave is not sensitive.
He's just like me.

04:39.578 --> 04:43.681
He is nothing like you.
He's very secure.

04:43.682 --> 04:46.817
Huh?
He is a sweetheart.

04:46.818 --> 04:49.053
Hold it, hold it. No.
This is what's happening today.

04:49.054 --> 04:50.855
I've waited a long time to put
the engine in the hot rod.

04:50.856 --> 04:53.824
It's my day and you're
not gonna interfere.
I'm not gonna interfere.

04:53.825 --> 04:55.727
We're just gonna stay long
enough for them to meet,

04:55.728 --> 04:57.662
Exchange a few words,
pick a pattern.

04:57.663 --> 05:00.030
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>
ahh, love this!

05:00.031 --> 05:03.167
<i>(laughing)</i>

05:03.168 --> 05:04.902
Hi!
Hey, jill.

05:04.903 --> 05:06.638
Wait till you see
what I got in there.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.172
The most beautiful car
you've ever seen...
Yeah?

05:08.173 --> 05:09.607
Hello.
Hi.

05:09.608 --> 05:11.309
Hi, I'm karen.
I've heard so much
about you.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.111
Relax, karen. This is bob.

05:14.112 --> 05:16.013
Hi.

05:16.014 --> 05:18.015
Bob, karen. Karen, bob.
Hey, karen.

05:18.016 --> 05:20.685
Forget dave.
What's wrong with bob?

05:20.686 --> 05:23.120
His lovely wife, leslie.

05:23.121 --> 05:25.356
Oh.
Oh, great!

05:25.357 --> 05:27.592
Leslie, meet my friend,
karen.
Hi.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.260
You look so beautiful.
Oh, thank you.

05:29.261 --> 05:31.496
I thought we weren't
bringing the wives.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.164
I know, but leslie
keeps thinking

05:33.165 --> 05:35.966
She's going into labor.
What was I supposed to do?

05:35.967 --> 05:38.369
Let her start.
It takes hours.

05:40.839 --> 05:43.741
Bob, did we leave that other
cheese log in the car?

05:43.742 --> 05:46.277
No, honey. You ate it.
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:46.278 --> 05:48.313
<i>(jill)</i> this has gotta be dave.

05:48.314 --> 05:51.115
Oh, I married an idiot.
Wanda!

05:51.116 --> 05:53.551
That man cannot drive.

05:53.552 --> 05:55.653
Wanda, you slam the car door
on my head again,

05:55.654 --> 05:57.789
You are riding in the trunk.
Hello, jill.

05:57.790 --> 06:00.325
You know, hank,
most people think

06:00.326 --> 06:02.193
When they see
a left turn signal on,

06:02.194 --> 06:03.728
That you're gonna turn left.

06:03.729 --> 06:06.063
The lane opened to my right.
I had to make a quick decision.

06:06.064 --> 06:09.467
The sidewalk was not
the right decision.

06:09.468 --> 06:11.703
Wanda, it's so nice
to see you.

06:11.704 --> 06:14.572
She's not supposed
to be here.
You tell her.

06:18.877 --> 06:21.145
Problem, tim?

06:21.146 --> 06:23.748
<i>(growls)</i>

06:23.749 --> 06:26.250
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

06:26.251 --> 06:29.119
Balanced and blueprinted
in the prettiest 350 horses

06:29.120 --> 06:31.121
You're ever gonna see.

06:31.122 --> 06:34.692
Oh, nice.
Aw, that's nice.

06:34.693 --> 06:37.595
Howdy, partners.

06:49.274 --> 06:51.709
Hi, al. Nice hat.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.979
What's that, 500 gallon?

06:54.980 --> 06:57.948
You know everybody.
Bob, hank, guys,
say howdy to al.

06:57.949 --> 07:00.385
Howdy, al.
Howdy.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.186
Howdy, al.
Howdy.

07:02.187 --> 07:04.188
Tim, didn't I read that
a chevy engine in a ford

07:04.189 --> 07:06.457
Was a felony in michigan?

07:06.458 --> 07:09.560
You know, tim told me
it was a western theme.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.328
Let's go over this
one more time.

07:11.329 --> 07:13.464
I picked the chevy 'cause
it's got more midrange torque.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.800
Ok? I got availability of parts.
I think it's a better motor--

07:15.801 --> 07:18.703
Hey, hey, it's your rod.
Thank you.

07:18.704 --> 07:22.640
Tim told me it was
a western theme.

07:22.641 --> 07:25.810
Vinnie mcgurn's dead!
<i>(tim)</i> now what?

07:25.811 --> 07:28.713
He ruined my helmet.
So what?
A little whipped cream.

07:28.714 --> 07:30.648
No, shaving.

07:35.287 --> 07:37.288
Where you going
with the hose?

07:37.289 --> 07:39.356
I thought maybe
I'd water the lawn.

07:39.357 --> 07:41.358
What did I tell you
about water balloons?

07:41.359 --> 07:42.460
<i>(spits)</i>

07:42.461 --> 07:45.296
Fill them up real full
so they bust on contact?

07:45.297 --> 07:48.365
That's right.

07:48.366 --> 07:52.069
Hey. I hear you're quite
a football player.

07:52.070 --> 07:53.337
Yeah.
Show me your moves.

07:53.338 --> 07:54.906
All right.
See if you can get by me.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.508
Ready? Down! Point!

07:57.509 --> 07:59.376
22! Hut! Hut!

08:04.616 --> 08:07.117
Somebody want to give me
a hand here?

08:08.720 --> 08:10.120
Aah!

08:10.121 --> 08:12.590
You got a good kid, taylor.
Thank you, bob.

08:12.591 --> 08:14.659
You're about to have a son
any day now, aren't you?

08:14.660 --> 08:17.862
Yeah, two weeks.
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it.

08:17.863 --> 08:21.031
Leslie's up to a six-pack
of cheese logs a day.

08:21.032 --> 08:24.502
Wanda ate a cheese log cabin.

08:26.605 --> 08:28.940
You know, if she's not eating,
she's crying.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.909
But I mean, hey, you know,
once she has the kid,

08:31.910 --> 08:34.779
The mood swings are gonna stop.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.847
Right?

08:43.288 --> 08:45.690
<i>(both)</i> yeah, right.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.760
What's at the cinemark 18?

08:49.761 --> 08:52.630
18 movies with women
thinner than me.

08:52.631 --> 08:54.164
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

08:54.165 --> 08:56.100
Ah, this has gotta be dave.

08:58.336 --> 09:00.337
Well, hi, dave.
Hi, jill. How are you?

09:00.338 --> 09:02.439
Come on in.
Thanks.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.709
I have some friends
that I want you to meet.

09:04.710 --> 09:06.811
That's leslie,
and this is wanda.

09:06.812 --> 09:09.246
And here, this is karen kelly.

09:09.247 --> 09:11.081
Dave gibbons.
Nice to meet you.

09:11.082 --> 09:13.818
You know, I was just thinking
how weird it is that you two
have never met,

09:13.819 --> 09:15.620
Because you have so much
in common.

09:15.621 --> 09:16.988
Really?
Yeah.

09:16.989 --> 09:18.956
Like what?

09:21.292 --> 09:23.293
Well...

09:23.294 --> 09:25.496
You coach mark's soccer team.

09:25.497 --> 09:29.066
And one time after a game...

09:29.067 --> 09:31.035
Mark threw up in karen's car.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.641
How about that?

09:36.642 --> 09:39.343
Small world.
See ya.

09:39.344 --> 09:41.979
Hey, dave, you big dipstick.
About time, buddy.

09:41.980 --> 09:43.447
Well, somebody stopped
by the shop

09:43.448 --> 09:47.284
Who's actually paying me
to work on their engine, tim.

09:47.285 --> 09:50.320
That hurt me deeply, dave.

09:50.321 --> 09:53.257
Grab a beer
and let's get greasy.
<i>(both grunt)</i>

09:53.258 --> 09:55.960
Uh, dave, dave,
we're trying to pick a movie.

09:55.961 --> 09:57.862
Jill, jill, please...
Can you recommend one?

09:57.863 --> 10:00.865
Yeah, I just rented
<i>it happened one night.</i>

10:00.866 --> 10:02.867
Well, you see what
I'm talking about?

10:02.868 --> 10:04.702
That movie is one of
her favorite movies.

10:04.703 --> 10:07.038
What are the odds?
Go figure.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.646
Karen, do you know
how to drive a car?

10:15.647 --> 10:17.048
Yes, tim.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.649
I can't believe it.
So does dave!

10:18.650 --> 10:21.385
It's kismet!

10:21.386 --> 10:24.722
Look! <i>Some like it hot</i>
is on tv in 15 minutes.

10:24.723 --> 10:26.591
We could just stay here
and make popcorn.
No, no, no, no.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.593
We're all going to a movie.
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.596
<i>Some like it hot.</i>
I could definitely get
into seeing that.

10:31.597 --> 10:33.698
Oh, I'm in.
On my best day,

10:33.699 --> 10:37.702
I never looked as good
in a dress as tony curtis.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.870
That settles it.
We're definitely staying.

10:39.871 --> 10:42.006
Staying is a bad idea.
Leaving would be a good idea.

10:42.007 --> 10:43.708
No, no, no, no.
This is great.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.710
This is great.
We'll barbecue.

10:45.711 --> 10:48.980
Oh, honey,
we're gonna barbecue!
Barbecue's a bad idea.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.416
The guys are not interested
in a barbecue.
Nobody wants to barbecue.

10:52.417 --> 10:54.885
I'll have a hot dog.
I'll have a steak.

10:54.886 --> 10:56.520
I can make shish kebab.

10:56.521 --> 10:59.624
<i>(grunts)</i>

10:59.625 --> 11:01.358
No, I like joe brown.

11:01.359 --> 11:03.628
I like his mouth.
He's got a great mouth.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.429
Hey, al.
How's it going in there?

11:05.430 --> 11:08.499
Oh, well, right now,
tim and hank are
explaining to bob

11:08.500 --> 11:10.367
Just what it feels like
to be pregnant.

11:10.368 --> 11:12.069
Oh, yeah, right.

11:12.070 --> 11:14.105
The day one of those he-men
goes to the john

11:14.106 --> 11:17.808
And shoots a nine-pound ham
out his butt, then he can talk.

11:20.912 --> 11:23.614
Leslie, are you all right?

11:23.615 --> 11:27.084
I don't know
if it's the onions
or the hormones.

11:27.085 --> 11:28.853
<i>(all)</i> hormones.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.756
They say postpartum depression
is even worse.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.458
Well, you know,
postpartum can be tough.

11:34.459 --> 11:36.527
After you've had that
little baby inside of you
for nine months,

11:36.528 --> 11:38.595
It can be hard to let go.
Yeah.

11:38.596 --> 11:40.564
Yes, it can.

11:45.137 --> 11:48.539
Well, not that I know what
postpartum depression is.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.375
But I do know what it
feels like to have someone
be a part of you,

11:51.376 --> 11:54.078
And suddenly be separated
from them.

11:54.079 --> 11:56.413
I know exactly
what you mean, al.

11:56.414 --> 11:58.783
I just got out of one
of those relationships.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.284
Really?
Yeah.

12:00.285 --> 12:02.219
Love hurts.

12:04.289 --> 12:07.491
And in hank's case,
it sweats, too.

12:10.796 --> 12:14.131
Go down, down, down, down.
All right, we're in.

12:14.132 --> 12:15.599
Now the fun begins.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.302
Hank, dave, get the trim
to the mounts up front.

12:18.303 --> 12:21.172
And I will align the tranny
back here with bob.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.707
Tim.
Hi, honey.

12:22.708 --> 12:24.575
Where's al?
We need him out here.

12:24.576 --> 12:27.511
We're using him
as our love toy.

12:29.915 --> 12:31.849
Don't let wanda hurt him.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.121
Come on, guys.
The food is ready.

12:37.122 --> 12:38.589
All right!
Oh, great...

12:38.590 --> 12:40.324
We just got started.
Come on, dave.

12:40.325 --> 12:42.727
Come back here.

12:42.728 --> 12:44.528
We just got started.
Well, come on...

12:44.529 --> 12:46.463
Tim, I need that steak!

12:54.339 --> 12:56.107
<i>(karen)</i> four words,
four words...

12:56.108 --> 12:58.042
Fourth word. Go.
Ok, fourth word.

13:00.478 --> 13:04.081
Hi. You gonna join us?
Things are going so well.

13:04.082 --> 13:06.250
Oh, by the way,
hank wants another hamburger.

13:06.251 --> 13:09.820
And dave picked karen
to be his partner.

13:11.656 --> 13:13.523
Hey, why don't you and I
play a little game?
What?

13:13.524 --> 13:15.826
Let's play a little game,
just you and I. Let's play.

13:15.827 --> 13:19.029
Ok.
Ok, all right.

13:19.030 --> 13:22.099
Three words. First word.

13:22.100 --> 13:24.935
Me. Woman. Jill.

13:24.936 --> 13:26.937
Jill, ok.

13:26.938 --> 13:29.339
Three words.
Third word, third word.

13:29.340 --> 13:33.477
Hamburger. Red.
Uh, meat.

13:33.478 --> 13:35.479
Meat. Jill blank meat.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.214
Second word.

13:44.222 --> 13:46.157
Jill dead meat.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.096
So I guess you're
kind of annoyed

13:52.097 --> 13:54.198
That nobody's working
on your engine.

13:54.199 --> 13:56.700
Well, how would
you feel about it?

13:56.701 --> 13:58.803
If you planned a wedding shower
for three months

13:58.804 --> 13:59.870
The night
of the wedding shower,

13:59.871 --> 14:01.605
I bring these guys over
to watch football?

14:01.606 --> 14:05.142
That happened, tim.

14:05.143 --> 14:08.478
And you didn't like it,
did you?

14:08.479 --> 14:11.148
Hey, leslie wants her burger
right now.

14:11.149 --> 14:13.083
Like them rare?
That's raw.

14:13.084 --> 14:15.019
She'll eat it.

14:17.655 --> 14:19.890
Look, I know that
you're not happy

14:19.891 --> 14:21.558
That things didn't go
the way you planned.

14:21.559 --> 14:24.128
But more importantly,
we've got two friends

14:24.129 --> 14:25.762
That we're trying to get
together in there.

14:25.763 --> 14:27.731
Not we - <i>you.</i>

14:27.732 --> 14:29.666
Why do you always
have to fix people up?

14:29.667 --> 14:33.403
Everybody does that.
Everybody doesn't do that.

14:33.404 --> 14:35.739
Women do that.
Guys don't sit around and go,

14:35.740 --> 14:38.675
"boy, frank, we gotta find
somebody for him.

14:38.676 --> 14:41.045
"I mean, all he does is
go to that great job,

14:41.046 --> 14:44.114
Watch football, drink beer
and race his car on weekends.

14:44.115 --> 14:47.417
His life is just so empty."

14:47.418 --> 14:50.821
Why haven't I met frank?
There is no frank!

14:50.822 --> 14:52.389
Well, then why did you
bring him up?

14:52.390 --> 14:54.725
Just to show
how obsessed you get--
I am not obsessed!

14:54.726 --> 14:56.360
Then why do you put us
through this?

14:56.361 --> 14:58.829
Well, because maybe
I want everybody
to be as happy as we are!

14:58.830 --> 15:01.398
Uh, timmy, hate to bother you,
but do you have any kaopectate?

15:01.399 --> 15:03.334
In a minute.
I don't have a minute.

15:08.606 --> 15:10.674
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

15:10.675 --> 15:13.344
That smells delicious,
good neighbor.

15:13.345 --> 15:16.713
Hi, wilson.
Oh, good neighborette.

15:16.714 --> 15:19.350
How are you
this fine evening, jill?
Fine and dandy.

15:19.351 --> 15:23.187
Mmm... That smells good.
You want a hamburger?

15:23.188 --> 15:26.156
Well, I don't mind if I do.

15:26.157 --> 15:30.961
Wilson, aren't human beings
more important than machines?

15:30.962 --> 15:32.396
Well, without a doubt.

15:32.397 --> 15:35.799
Although, I am quite
fond of my waffle maker.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.268
Well, thank you.
I wish you would tell that

15:37.269 --> 15:39.103
To that knucklehead
I'm married to.

15:39.104 --> 15:41.906
Oh, he knows how I feel.
He's had my waffles.

15:43.608 --> 15:46.843
No, I mean about
the human being thing.

15:46.844 --> 15:49.213
Well, I think tim
understands that.

15:49.214 --> 15:52.216
Well, you would never
know from the way that
he is acting today.

15:52.217 --> 15:54.718
Jill, I like my burger
well done.
Oh.

15:54.719 --> 15:57.454
I mean, here I am trying to get
these two people together

15:57.455 --> 16:00.524
And all he can think about
is this hunk of metal
in the garage.

16:00.525 --> 16:04.061
Well, that's because to him
it's more than just
a hunk of metal.

16:04.062 --> 16:07.497
To tim, it's a 1934
roadster street rod,

16:07.498 --> 16:11.101
Mystic midnight blue,
queen bee headlights,

16:11.102 --> 16:14.271
Suicide doors with hidden
hinges, rolled rear pan...

16:14.272 --> 16:17.441
<i>(grunting)</i> oh, yes...

16:17.442 --> 16:21.545
I know it's important to him.
So he lost a day. Big deal.

16:21.546 --> 16:24.348
You know, he's taking this
so personally.

16:24.349 --> 16:26.783
You know, jill....
The navajo indians believe

16:26.784 --> 16:30.955
That when a craftsman makes
a basket or a sand painting,

16:30.956 --> 16:34.058
His spirit actually
enters the object,

16:34.059 --> 16:36.060
And he becomes a part of it.

16:37.762 --> 16:41.465
So you're saying
that the two become one?

16:41.466 --> 16:45.069
That's about it.

16:45.070 --> 16:50.174
So by dismissing the object,
I've been dismissing the man.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.276
Thank you, wilson.
Jill?

16:52.277 --> 16:54.345
Jill?

16:54.346 --> 16:56.280
The burger?

16:57.782 --> 16:59.416
Bye, I'll walk you out.

16:59.417 --> 17:01.751
Great party, tim.
Thanks, al.

17:01.752 --> 17:04.588
You know, I think
the western shirt paid off.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.589
What do you mean?
Karen.

17:06.590 --> 17:10.027
I think she took
a shine to me.

17:10.028 --> 17:11.661
Our... Karen here? Our--

17:11.662 --> 17:14.698
Do you think it would be
all right if I asked her out
for coffee?

17:14.699 --> 17:16.133
You know,
karen's quite a handful.

17:16.134 --> 17:19.836
Well, my mother is a handful.
I like that in a woman.

17:21.506 --> 17:23.507
Al, maybe you're moving
kind of quick here

17:23.508 --> 17:25.041
After the problem
with greta.

17:25.042 --> 17:28.012
Oh no, tim. One door
may have closed for me,

17:28.012 --> 17:30.147
But another door
is just opening.

17:31.916 --> 17:35.552
Hi, karen.
Hi, al.

17:35.553 --> 17:38.389
Karen, I was wondering
if you...
You ready to go, karen?

17:38.390 --> 17:40.357
Yeah, sure.

17:40.358 --> 17:42.292
What were you gonna say, al?

17:42.293 --> 17:45.529
I was just wondering if you...

17:45.530 --> 17:48.465
...Or anyone

17:48.466 --> 17:51.868
Would care for another cup
of coffee.

17:51.869 --> 17:55.939
Oh, well, dave and I were
just gonna go out for coffee.

17:55.940 --> 17:58.542
Oh, well, then you
wouldn't want one.

17:58.543 --> 18:00.010
Good night.

18:06.684 --> 18:09.453
And another door slammed shut.

18:10.988 --> 18:13.890
It was a joke.
It was a joke, al.
It was a joke.

18:13.891 --> 18:16.360
Isn't this great?
What did I tell you?

18:16.361 --> 18:19.029
Everybody could feel
the chemistry
between karen and dave.

18:19.030 --> 18:22.433
I mean, I knew it.
I knew that they
would be perfect...

18:22.434 --> 18:24.935
For each other.

18:24.936 --> 18:26.437
<i>(continues mouthing)</i>

18:26.438 --> 18:28.372
But I could be wrong.

18:28.373 --> 18:32.476
I mean, what do I know
about chemistry?

18:32.477 --> 18:35.412
I didn't even have
a chemistry set
when I was a kid.

18:35.413 --> 18:38.848
You know, and I...
I'm gonna do the dishes now.

18:42.353 --> 18:44.654
Well, I'd...
I'd better get going here.

18:46.224 --> 18:48.058
Al, wait a minute.
I gotta wire
that hot rod tomorrow.

18:48.059 --> 18:50.461
Maybe you want to help me
with that.

18:52.163 --> 18:54.898
Well, I thought you
only wanted dave
to look at that.

18:54.899 --> 18:56.600
I think you and I
could do it.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.668
Really?
Yeah.

18:58.669 --> 19:00.404
Well, then we could take
a look at the drive train.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.272
Let's not get
carried away.
Ok.

19:02.273 --> 19:07.377
All right.
Well, you better get going
before that hat gives birth.

19:07.378 --> 19:09.813
All right.
See you tomorrow afternoon.

19:09.814 --> 19:12.882
Happy trails, buckaroo.

19:21.626 --> 19:24.661
Tim, that was really nice
what you said to al.

19:24.662 --> 19:26.763
I'm sure he appreciates it.

19:26.764 --> 19:28.698
Yeah, yeah.

19:30.602 --> 19:33.270
I'm sorry you didn't get
as much done today
as you would have liked.

19:33.271 --> 19:35.472
But at least you got
the engine in.

19:35.473 --> 19:38.942
Can you start it?
No, jill.

19:38.943 --> 19:41.445
We could play charades
and pretend I could start it.

19:41.446 --> 19:44.314
<i>(engine noises)</i>

19:50.921 --> 19:54.458
You know,
now that this engine's in,
it's just so beautiful.

19:54.459 --> 19:58.094
It's really starting
to look like a car.
A street rod.

19:58.095 --> 20:00.030
A street rod.

20:02.933 --> 20:05.335
So, this is the front.

20:07.838 --> 20:09.373
Yes, jill.
This is the front.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.308
And hey, look here.

20:13.678 --> 20:15.612
The back.

20:17.248 --> 20:19.049
No, really. I'm...

20:19.050 --> 20:22.586
I'm beginning to
envision this, you know.

20:22.587 --> 20:25.589
The mystic midnight blue,

20:25.590 --> 20:29.259
Queen bee headlights,

20:29.260 --> 20:31.828
Windshield...

20:31.829 --> 20:34.665
Suicide doors,

20:34.666 --> 20:36.500
Rolling rear end...

20:36.501 --> 20:38.935
Rolled rear pan.

20:41.072 --> 20:44.241
Rolled rear pan.
And this, of course,

20:44.242 --> 20:46.510
Which is the soul
of the beast...

20:46.511 --> 20:48.579
<i>(engine sounds)</i>

20:50.348 --> 20:56.152
Gotta tell you, tim.
This street rod is real tweaky.

20:56.153 --> 20:58.088
It's tweaked out.

20:59.824 --> 21:03.227
Exactly. It's cherry.

21:03.228 --> 21:06.230
You know, I'm really getting
into this engine stuff.

21:06.231 --> 21:09.733
I feel an uncontrollable urge
to torque something.

21:09.734 --> 21:11.968
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:16.507 --> 21:19.075
Hey, you really want
to see something?
Yeah.

21:19.076 --> 21:20.777
Get on my crawler.
All right.

21:20.778 --> 21:23.680
Lay down. Watch your head.

21:23.681 --> 21:26.516
You can't really appreciate
an engine until you've seen it
from all sides.

21:26.517 --> 21:29.286
Oh, this is so cool.

21:32.290 --> 21:37.193
Welcome to the wonderful world
of the small block 350.

21:44.269 --> 21:46.970
<i>(jill chuckles)</i>

21:46.971 --> 21:49.172
Tim?
<i>(grunts)</i>

21:49.173 --> 21:51.808
I thought you were
gonna show me the engine.

21:51.809 --> 21:54.478
I call this my engine.

22:01.085 --> 22:04.087
You guys get
those mcgurn boys?
No, we didn't get them.

22:04.088 --> 22:06.055
Why?
Some bullies...

22:06.056 --> 22:08.191
Their mom made them go inside
and clean their rooms.

22:08.192 --> 22:09.426
Yeah...
What a waste.

22:09.427 --> 22:12.028
Look at this, dad,
we had the perfect balloon.

22:12.029 --> 22:15.732
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-
ho-ho-ho-ho!

22:15.733 --> 22:18.034
Boy, that baby's got some
splatter power there.

22:18.035 --> 22:20.170
Brad! Randy, mark!

22:20.171 --> 22:23.707
Take it! Take this!
Will you stop it
with the water balloons!

22:23.708 --> 22:26.710
I wish that you would not
encourage them.

22:28.279 --> 22:30.280
Just 'cause you find balloons
doesn't mean

22:30.281 --> 22:32.449
They're making water balloons
out of them, hon.

22:32.450 --> 22:35.652
Maybe they're making, uh...

22:35.653 --> 22:36.920
...Balloon animals.

22:36.921 --> 22:39.255
Balloon animals?
Yeah, sure.

22:39.256 --> 22:41.157
So you think I'm being
too strict with them again?

22:41.158 --> 22:44.060
Yeah.
Well... Ok.

22:44.061 --> 22:45.462
Thank you.
You bet, honey.

22:45.463 --> 22:47.564
Thank you for telling me.

22:51.669 --> 22:53.002
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

22:55.139 --> 22:56.540
<i>(jill)</i> whoo!

22:58.075 --> 23:00.176
I think you and I
could do it.

23:00.177 --> 23:01.511
Really?
Yeah.

23:01.512 --> 23:04.614
Well, then, we could take
a look at the drive train.

23:07.685 --> 23:09.553
Let's not get crazy.

23:14.892 --> 23:16.125
I think we can do it.

23:16.126 --> 23:17.728
Really?
Yeah.

23:17.729 --> 23:19.929
Well, then we could take
a look at the drive train.
