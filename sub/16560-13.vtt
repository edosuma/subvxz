WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.711
Previously on Rosewood...

00:04.379 --> 00:05.964
When Rosie is out-partying Joo-Joo,

00:06.047 --> 00:07.424
something just ain't right.

00:07.507 --> 00:09.509
Damn! You had to hit him that hard?

00:09.592 --> 00:11.344
He smells like hookers
and cheap tequila.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.971
Not cheap. Broke.

00:13.054 --> 00:14.264
Flat-ass broke.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.391
You're not taking care of yourself.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.143
What you're doing it hurts me.

00:18.309 --> 00:19.853
And if that doesn't mean anything
to you,

00:19.936 --> 00:22.230
then, by all means,
do whatever you want.

00:22.439 --> 00:23.398
I'm gonna be okay.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.650
I ran the additional test
you asked for.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.736
-Do you have family?
-Yes, but they don't know I'm here.

00:27.986 --> 00:29.529
I think you're gonna need them.

01:52.695 --> 01:53.905
Your recent
bender did more

01:53.988 --> 01:56.199
damage to your body than we thought.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.575
But the treatment should work.

01:57.659 --> 01:59.160
If your body responds.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.912
If it doesn't,
how long do I have?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.789
Let's cross that bridge...

02:02.872 --> 02:04.916
Now, are you telling me I
should get my house in order?

02:05.083 --> 02:06.209
If it were me,

02:06.292 --> 02:08.795
I'd make sure my business
was on solid ground,

02:09.045 --> 02:10.296
just in case.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.267
This is new.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.685
Victim crashes through
a farmer's market.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.520
Oh, her name's Naomi Bauer.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.688
According to witnesses,

02:26.771 --> 02:29.232
she made no attempts
to avoid hitting anything.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.984
We ruled out mechanical failure.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.361
The car's in the middle of the street,
didn't stop on impact.

02:33.444 --> 02:35.405
Well, apparently,
the car rolled to a stop.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.907
When bystanders went to go check
on her, she was already dead.

02:38.032 --> 02:40.243
The car lost momentum after her foot
slipped off the accelerator.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.327
Looks that way.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.414
And either Naomi wanted
to intentionally hurt people or...

02:44.622 --> 02:46.291
Something happened beyond her control.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.794
Please tell me
that's not Blue Thunder.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.171
-That's not Blue Thunder.
-Rosie.

02:51.254 --> 02:52.839
Hey, I'm just practicing
what you tell me to do.

02:52.922 --> 02:53.756
I don't like it. I don't.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.091
Hey, guys!

02:55.717 --> 02:58.428
Just so you know,
I'm super pumped to be here.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.930
And why exactly is Boy Wonder here?

03:01.014 --> 03:01.848
Oh, thank you for that.

03:01.931 --> 03:03.892
Which one do I remind you
of Dick Grayson? Tim Drake?

03:03.975 --> 03:05.059
I'm partial to Dick.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.770
I just thought I'd get Mitchie
some more experience in the field.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.148
Doesn't this feel like old
times... like the original?

03:10.231 --> 03:11.441
You, me, us three.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.942
Mitchie, it was one case.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.360
I know. It was one awesome case.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.070
I personally remember every detail.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.530
Don't you?

03:17.614 --> 03:19.866
♪ I'll remind you later ♪

03:21.075 --> 03:24.037
I know what you're gonna say,
"Working a crime scene is our thing,

03:24.120 --> 03:25.246
not our thing and his thing." I know.

03:25.330 --> 03:28.249
It could be his thing,
too... in moderation.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.210
At first, it was Adrian,
and now it's Mitchie.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.419
I mean, you're getting a little loose

03:31.502 --> 03:33.046
with the invites to our thing, okay?

03:33.129 --> 03:34.130
What's... What's going on?

03:34.214 --> 03:36.549
Nothing. Just spreading
the Rosilla love.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.218
Got to spread the love.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
Whatever happened to Naomi,
she knew it was coming.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.014
Why do you say that?

03:43.097 --> 03:45.600
Directions to the nearest hospital
were pulled up on her phone.

03:45.683 --> 03:47.185
So far, I don't see any wounds,

03:47.268 --> 03:49.229
so we could be looking
at sudden cardiac death.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.147
Or some other cause
that we'll see in autopsy.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.315
Let's get Naomi to the lab.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.733
I'll call Slade.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.777
Even though this isn't a homicide yet,

03:55.860 --> 03:58.947
this is definitely a case for you two.

03:59.572 --> 04:00.782
Did she just embrace our threesome?

04:00.865 --> 04:02.325
Well, you should say "trio."

04:02.408 --> 04:03.952
-Right, trio.
-All right?

04:04.702 --> 04:05.578
Okay, no, no, no.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.914
It's... It's not a grab, it's a bump.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.916
All right, Mitchie, help me help you.

04:09.999 --> 04:11.000
Bump.

04:11.084 --> 04:11.918
-There we go!
-Yeah.

04:12.001 --> 04:13.544
There we go. All right, Mitch.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.255
So much cooler than what I did.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.383
All right.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.552
Good morning, Mom.

04:21.636 --> 04:22.971
Morning, son.

04:23.054 --> 04:27.517
You know, I was thinking about that
conversation we had the other day.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.227
Which one? We have a lot of them.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.397
Well, the one where we were talking
about finding an investor for the lab.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.691
I don't remember
having that conversation with you.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
Actually, it was with your CPA,
but it was near my desk,

04:37.068 --> 04:39.028
so it's conversational
community property.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.488
I'm not sure
that's exactly how it works.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.242
Listen, you have put your heart
and soul into this lab.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.244
We have got to find the right person.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.871
Agreed, because the people
I've met with so far

04:48.955 --> 04:50.456
are not a good fit.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.375
What was wrong
with that last candidate?

04:52.458 --> 04:55.169
MBA from Harvard, owns
a private equity firm.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.547
Takes missionary trips every year.

04:57.630 --> 04:58.798
How'd you know about all that?

04:58.881 --> 05:00.508
Conversational community...

05:00.591 --> 05:02.969
I get it. Look,
he is impressive on paper,

05:03.052 --> 05:05.013
but my partner can't
just understand business.

05:05.179 --> 05:07.181
He needs to understand family,
and that guy just--

05:07.265 --> 05:09.892
Clearly didn't get enough hugs
growing up.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.519
So why don't you help me find someone?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.187
You know me. You know this lab.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.398
Thank the Lord!

05:16.107 --> 05:17.817
I thought you'd never ask.

05:22.947 --> 05:24.365
This new investor idea is good.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.658
I think Mom's gonna
find you somebody great.

05:25.742 --> 05:27.910
Yeah, I think new blood in the
lab will be awesome, actually.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.079
I have a whole list of things
for the new boss man.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.206
Okay, team uniforms
better not be on that list.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.124
They are.

05:33.207 --> 05:35.501
And why do you have such
a problem with unity?

05:35.585 --> 05:36.919
All right, let's get to work.

05:45.678 --> 05:46.512
Is it me, or is that...

05:46.596 --> 05:48.514
That a lot of blood for a dead person.

05:48.598 --> 05:49.849
-Tara, call 911.
-What?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.184
911, now!

05:51.267 --> 05:52.185
And what do you want me to tell them?

05:52.268 --> 05:53.728
-That our victim is still alive.
-What?

05:53.811 --> 05:55.480
Naomi's pulse is going in and out.

05:55.563 --> 05:56.689
Mitchie, get the defib.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.317
Pippy, you start the compressions.
I'll start mouth to mouth.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.236
One, two, three. Go.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.405
Two, three. Go.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.491
One, two, three.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.159
This is good. This is good.

06:08.242 --> 06:10.244
Come on, come on, come on.

06:10.328 --> 06:11.788
That is a lot of blood
for a dead person.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.289
-One, two.
-Clear.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.125
That is a lot of blood
for a dead person.

06:17.585 --> 06:18.961
Clear.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.630
Come on, come on, come on.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.343
Oh, my God!

06:25.426 --> 06:27.095
Oh, breathe, breathe, breathe.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.139
Cover her. Cover her.
Give her... give her something.

06:31.849 --> 06:32.892
It's okay.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.311
Oh, my goodness.

06:35.395 --> 06:36.938
Welcome back, Naomi.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.718
Rosie?

07:08.719 --> 07:09.804
Rosie?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.472
Rosie?

07:12.807 --> 07:13.641
You okay?

07:13.724 --> 07:15.810
Yeah. Yeah, no, I'm... I'm good.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.645
The meds are just playing
with my head.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.689
I mean, how did this happen?

07:19.772 --> 07:22.400
Her clinical picture fits
with diffuse paralysis.

07:22.483 --> 07:25.194
She must have felt it coming
and decided to go to the hospital.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.113
She developed severe hyperventilation.

07:27.196 --> 07:29.365
It made it difficult
to detect her pulse at the scene.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.616
Do we know what caused this?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.618
Could have been a disease
that we haven't diagnosed yet

07:32.702 --> 07:34.954
or a deliberate poisoning.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.914
That's a no. Great.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.125
And she's not in any
condition to talk to us.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.960
So we're not just gonna sit here
and wait for answers, are we?

07:41.043 --> 07:42.253
Also a no.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.921
As far as Slade is concerned,

07:44.005 --> 07:46.799
this is an attempted murder case
until evidence says otherwise.

07:47.383 --> 07:48.259
Ma'am.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.510
Let's go check out her place.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.220
Let's check it out.

07:54.849 --> 07:56.017
When I saw you at the hospital,

07:56.100 --> 07:57.643
you looked like
you were somewhere else.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.854
Just getting used to my new meds
and the side effects.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.063
Everything okay?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.315
Yeah, everything's fine.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.399
That's it. It's open.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.734
Let me know if you need anything else.

08:04.817 --> 08:05.818
Thanks.

08:08.696 --> 08:11.991
So, I'm guessing she's an editor.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.077
She's not an editor.
She's a documentary filmmaker.

08:15.161 --> 08:17.580
Hello? Naomi!

08:18.372 --> 08:20.833
-Girl, you here?
-Detective Annalise Villa, EMPD.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.544
Dr. Beaumont Rosewood Jr.,
forensic pathologist.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.713
Wait, so a cop and a pathologist?

08:25.796 --> 08:27.632
That's us. Who are you?

08:27.715 --> 08:28.883
I'm Craig.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.676
That's Greta and Dmitry.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.136
We're a part of Naomi's film crew.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.430
What's going on? Where's Naomi?

08:34.514 --> 08:36.766
She's in a hospital,
recovering from diffuse paralysis.

08:36.849 --> 08:38.142
What do you mean? What happened?

08:38.226 --> 08:39.560
We're not sure yet.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.230
Did Naomi have any enemies?

08:42.313 --> 08:43.940
Maybe one of her subjects?

08:44.815 --> 08:45.816
Need you guys to dig deep

08:45.900 --> 08:47.443
because it's possible
that what happened to Naomi

08:47.527 --> 08:48.528
was not an accident.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.404
I know who's at the top of my list.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.406
This is when you actually say
the person's name.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.450
Emmitt. Emmitt Townsend.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.035
He's this other director.

08:56.118 --> 08:57.745
He and Naomi
were chasing the same story,

08:57.828 --> 08:59.872
and Naomi beat him out.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.582
And he wasn't happy.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.959
Any idea what that story was about?

09:03.042 --> 09:05.127
No. She was gonna tell us today.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.046
When was the last time you guys
saw Naomi?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.840
It was around 7:00 a.m. this morning.
Why?

09:09.966 --> 09:11.717
Because she crashed
into the farmer's market

09:11.801 --> 09:13.177
around 9:00 a.m.

09:13.261 --> 09:14.470
The paralysis was acute,

09:14.554 --> 09:17.139
which confirms that it wasn't caused
by an internal disease, which means--

09:17.223 --> 09:19.058
We're looking at an attempted murder.

09:19.141 --> 09:20.393
Oh, God.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.396
It's time to talk to Naomi.

09:24.647 --> 09:26.357
Hornstock is looking
for Emmitt Townsend.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.776
Do you really think
their rivalry escalated to murder?

09:28.859 --> 09:29.944
Well, anything's possible.

09:30.027 --> 09:32.029
For most people,
the rivalry is not about the thing

09:32.113 --> 09:33.239
that they're fighting over,

09:33.322 --> 09:35.491
it's about the broken relationship
at the center of it all.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.285
For me, it was Connie Amicangelo.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.996
Went to our rival high school,
played her in basketball every year,

09:40.079 --> 09:42.039
and every year,
that bitch played dirty.

09:42.123 --> 09:43.583
Villa, I need you to let that go.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.667
Tell me you have a rival,

09:44.750 --> 09:46.460
someone who was consumed
with taking you down.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.045
I don't know why,
but that would make me happy.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.338
Well, I hate to disappoint you,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.007
but I didn't have any rivals
growing up.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.342
So then and now, everyone loves Rosie.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.095
You know,
sometimes it's hard being around you.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.389
Excuse me. What-what happened
to the patient that was in that room?

09:58.472 --> 09:59.599
She checked out.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.058
She checked out?

10:01.142 --> 10:02.768
Where did she go?

10:08.649 --> 10:10.443
Oh. There you are.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.028
I think you lost something.

10:13.237 --> 10:14.488
Detective Villa?

10:14.572 --> 10:15.656
Where are we with the investigation?

10:15.740 --> 10:16.866
Talk to me.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.201
We'll talk all about it on
the way back to the hospital.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.328
Nice to meet you, too.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.330
For one, my doctor told me
I was poisoned,

10:22.413 --> 10:24.248
so I'm not gonna lie in bed
eating Jell-O

10:24.332 --> 10:25.833
with my ass hanging out of a gown.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.752
And, two, I just got here.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.254
Freaking security detail
drove her to the station.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.714
Let me get one.

10:31.797 --> 10:34.008
People have a hard time
saying no to me.

10:34.091 --> 10:35.092
It's a gift.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.011
She's like the lady Rosie.

10:37.094 --> 10:38.262
Oh, you're definitely going back.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.556
No, no, no, no. Look,
if she wants to talk, we'll talk.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.476
But first, you're gonna answer
some questions for us, all right?

10:43.559 --> 10:45.603
Yeah. I got snacks. I could do that.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.147
All right,
tell us about Emmitt Townsend.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.066
Why? Is he a suspect?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.110
Yes. He's a rival, and he's M.I.A.

10:53.194 --> 10:54.612
Oh. We grew up together.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.739
Rivals since high school,
competed over everything.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.240
He likes to think he's better than me.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.617
We spoke to your crew,

10:59.700 --> 11:02.828
and they said you got to a story
before he did.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.874
Yeah, and then he asked me
if we could do the story together.

11:06.957 --> 11:09.085
For some reason, he thought
we'd be better on the same side.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.086
I didn't buy it.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.379
You know what? Good for you.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.048
You should never let your rival
convince you that you're friends.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.300
Spoken like a man
who's had a few rivals in his day.

11:16.384 --> 11:19.762
To be honest with you, I can't
even remember their names.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.682
I can think of one name
you're gonna remember.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.225
What's the back story there?

11:24.308 --> 11:25.935
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.062
Well, according to Emmitt's Instagram,

11:28.145 --> 11:30.356
he moved onto another job,
never mentioned what it was.

11:30.439 --> 11:33.317
Or the post is bogus and
he's trying to hide the fact

11:33.401 --> 11:34.985
that he's still angry at you.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.363
Naomi, do you think Emmitt's
capable of committing murder?

11:37.446 --> 11:38.447
Oh.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.158
We've been going at it for so long...

11:41.242 --> 11:42.243
I hope not.

11:42.326 --> 11:44.453
Ira,
I'll put an A.P.B. out on Emmitt.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.372
Anybody else we should be looking at?

11:47.123 --> 11:50.960
I've done docs exposing corruption
in the oil industry,

11:51.043 --> 11:52.920
on Wall Street, in the housing market.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.589
So I've upset a lot of bad people.

11:55.673 --> 11:56.841
Is... Is... Is it just me,

11:56.924 --> 12:00.386
or do I sense a little bit of pride
in your voice?

12:10.896 --> 12:13.190
-You found someone.
-I found someone.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.443
Okay, don't keep me in suspense.

12:15.526 --> 12:17.570
I knew them from my days in education.

12:17.653 --> 12:21.240
They have recently
come into some money.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.909
They studied economics in college,

12:23.993 --> 12:25.995
but found their real passion
in education.

12:26.078 --> 12:29.373
Their charter school
is among the best.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.167
Any idea what their offer might be?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.210
Well, they're gonna want
to be an equity partner.

12:33.294 --> 12:34.462
Oh, love that.

12:34.545 --> 12:36.547
-But not the silent one.
-Hate that.

12:36.630 --> 12:38.466
Well, listen,
with this kind of investment,

12:38.549 --> 12:40.009
they're gonna have a
say in the day-to-day.

12:40.092 --> 12:43.095
Well, I want someone who's content
with the highlights,

12:43.179 --> 12:44.180
not the play-by-play.

12:44.263 --> 12:47.558
Yeah, well, you know we
need someone who wants both.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.976
Separation of church and state,

12:49.059 --> 12:50.811
that's the only way
this is gonna work.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.813
I don't want to lose what we have.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.940
I want you to have faith
that you won't.

12:56.984 --> 12:57.985
Beaumont!

12:58.068 --> 12:59.445
Okay, set up a meeting.

13:00.362 --> 13:03.699
All right, so, the hospital sent over
a sample of Naomi's blood.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.451
She was poisoned with tetrodotoxin.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.078
Which is derived from puffer fish.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.915
And prepped and sold in restaurants
with specially trained chefs.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.375
You know, it's weird
that such an adorable fish

13:13.459 --> 13:14.835
can cause so much damage, you know?

13:14.919 --> 13:16.837
They're like the baby bunnies
of the sea.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.215
My mom used to call me
a little puffer fish.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.925
I loved her so much.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.092
Okay, for your safety,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.678
we're gonna start using
the abbreviation TTX.

13:24.762 --> 13:25.846
-Okay. Got it.
-Okay.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.515
-Okay?
-Got it. Thank you.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.687
-Hey, Villa.
-We got a hit on Emmitt's toll tag.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.481
He exited the freeway near his house.

13:35.564 --> 13:37.233
Okay, let's see what he has to say
for himself.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.282
Mr. Townsend!

13:45.366 --> 13:46.575
EMPD!

13:47.743 --> 13:48.953
Hello?

13:50.871 --> 13:51.956
Mr. Townsend?

14:04.510 --> 14:06.846
You know I can't pass up
pressing a flashing button.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.681
Well, for once, I'd like you to try.

14:09.098 --> 14:10.224
I don't think you mean that.

14:28.784 --> 14:31.370
Did we just witness the murder
of our number-one suspect?

14:31.453 --> 14:33.956
Yes, but how did the footage
of his murder end up in his house?

14:34.039 --> 14:35.916
More importantly, where's his body?

14:39.003 --> 14:40.713
I have a pretty good idea.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.602
This is weird, but I have to ask.

14:54.685 --> 14:55.936
Emmitt is deceased.

14:56.020 --> 14:57.187
Mitchie checked.

14:58.772 --> 14:59.773
Twice.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.527
Naomi, you don't have to be the
one to do the identification.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.113
For reasons I don't want
to get into right now,

15:06.196 --> 15:07.698
I have to do this.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.700
Just get on with it.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.459
Naomi, we should go.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.461
Let them continue doing their thing.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.755
I may not be a cop or a pathologist,

15:22.838 --> 15:25.883
but I search for the truth
just like you guys.

15:26.425 --> 15:28.594
Someone tried to kill me
and they did kill Emmitt.

15:28.677 --> 15:30.679
I'm getting answers
with or without you,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.431
so it's your choice.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.810
The EMPD is processing Emmitt's house,

15:37.186 --> 15:39.396
and I have a team
sent over to his office.

15:39.480 --> 15:40.481
What do you guys have?

15:40.564 --> 15:42.983
Well, there's an injection mark
at the back of his neck.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.152
And then they found seeds
on Emmitt's clothing.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.614
We also found cuts on Emmitt's arms,

15:48.697 --> 15:50.240
and he was super clean.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.910
I mean, not like how Shaft
was super clean.

15:54.411 --> 15:56.830
But someone washed him
and redressed him.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.499
The body was moved and cleaned.

15:58.582 --> 16:00.459
The killer really doesn't want
us to find the crime scene.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.253
But they left the video of the murder
on Emmitt's home computer.

16:03.337 --> 16:08.217
He was probably wearing a GoPro,
set to send footage to his cloud.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.219
Trick of the trade,
so whoever did this,

16:10.302 --> 16:12.096
probably doesn't even know
the video's out there.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.473
Tox is in. I ran more extensive tests.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.351
Emmitt and Naomi were poisoned
with a synthetic TTX.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.353
-I'm sorry. Did you say TTX?
-Yes, she did.

16:19.436 --> 16:21.271
There's no coincidence
that you and Emmitt

16:21.355 --> 16:22.648
were poisoned with the same substance.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.275
We're looking for someone who
had it out for the both of you.

16:25.359 --> 16:27.528
And I'm guessing you know who that is.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.408
The story Emmitt and I fought over...

16:32.866 --> 16:34.702
I don't think he dropped it.

16:35.703 --> 16:37.705
I think he kept on digging.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.748
Who was the subject?

16:49.466 --> 16:52.094
My story was on a company
called Len Corp.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.221
I think they were the ones
who poisoned us.

16:54.304 --> 16:56.640
They are suspected
of kidnapping homeless people

16:56.724 --> 16:57.975
and testing new products on them.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.686
And I'm guessing one of the products
they make is TTX.

17:00.769 --> 17:01.812
Among other things.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.565
And assume that Len Corp
is as powerful as they come.

17:04.648 --> 17:06.483
But you decided
to take them on anyway.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.652
Eh, my default position
is staring down giants

17:08.736 --> 17:10.070
with a slingshot in my hand.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.613
So who's the man behind this company?

17:11.697 --> 17:12.865
Ian Alexander.

17:12.948 --> 17:14.950
He's a card-carrying douchebag, okay?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.326
That's who we'll have Slade bring in,

17:16.410 --> 17:19.288
and before you ask,
no, you can't watch.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.916
If it was you, you'd want to
stare directly into the face

17:23.000 --> 17:24.918
of the man
you think tried to kill you, no?

17:25.002 --> 17:27.588
So, if you don't mind,

17:27.671 --> 17:30.049
I'd like to hear what
the bastard has to say.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.891
Len Corp and its subsidiaries

17:38.974 --> 17:44.688
adhere to the highest standards
and guidelines across our divisions.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.981
We will completely coop--

17:46.065 --> 17:47.733
Oh, Mr. Alexander.

17:48.567 --> 17:50.903
Based on my questions so far,
I thought you'd see

17:50.986 --> 17:53.655
that I wanted to have a conversation
like grown men.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.200
Because right now,
I'm not here to go after you.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.535
But I promise you, I will...

17:59.244 --> 18:03.332
if we can't have a conversation
like grown men.

18:06.168 --> 18:07.419
All right.

18:07.503 --> 18:09.880
Is going in there and putting him
on his ass against the rules?

18:09.963 --> 18:11.173
Yes.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.926
But if it weren't, what would you do?

18:14.009 --> 18:15.219
You ever seen Hellraiser?

18:15.302 --> 18:16.762
-The first one?
-Of course.

18:16.845 --> 18:18.472
-Flesh hooks?
-Flesh hooks.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.349
I'm not mad at that.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.142
Naomi, you just made
a new dark friend.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.228
Let's get to the point.

18:24.686 --> 18:27.856
Naomi has made some serious claims
against your company.

18:29.024 --> 18:33.695
Despite the restraining order,
she continues to harass our employees.

18:33.779 --> 18:35.572
And what about Emmitt Townsend?

18:35.656 --> 18:37.783
Equally a thorn in your side?

18:37.866 --> 18:39.618
I'm sorry. Who is that?

18:39.701 --> 18:42.746
The other filmmaker
who's investigating your company.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.915
I don't know who that is.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.583
Anything else?

18:47.835 --> 18:48.877
That's it for now.

18:48.961 --> 18:49.962
You can go.

18:50.504 --> 18:51.630
All right.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.800
Hey, I appreciate you guys
coming in with your briefcases.

18:54.883 --> 18:56.051
Very helpful.

18:59.304 --> 19:02.516
Okay, so the C.E.O. knows me...

19:03.976 --> 19:05.352
but not Emmitt.

19:05.435 --> 19:07.855
Well, it could be a lie,
could be the truth.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.398
That's what we have to find out.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.191
Unfortunately, he is telling
the truth.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.734
Reading people is kind of my thing.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.944
Read Rosie.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.281
He says he's never had a rival,
but I don't buy it.

19:17.364 --> 19:19.408
Yeah, me neither.
Everyone has someone.

19:19.491 --> 19:20.659
Well, my someone is no one.

19:20.742 --> 19:24.246
But Villa's someone has a Great Dane
named Herschel and gives to charity.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.165
You looked up my high-school rival?

19:26.248 --> 19:28.959
When this is all over,
I'm doing a documentary on you guys.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.879
All right, look, I think
that Alexander there is dirty.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.672
And since I didn't get
a Christmas present from you,

19:33.755 --> 19:35.424
I want the proof wrapped up
in a nice bow.

19:35.507 --> 19:38.468
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You didn't get
the H3GB that I sent you?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.971
The Hearty, Healthy Holiday
Gift Basket? You didn't get that?

19:41.054 --> 19:42.181
Oh, right, right.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.725
I guess what I meant to say
is I didn't get anything good.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.185
You can do better.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.437
Slade, really? Oh. Wow.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.813
Okay.

19:49.897 --> 19:51.773
All right, so we have to prove
that the TTX

19:51.857 --> 19:54.151
that poisoned Naomi and Emmitt
belonged to Len Corp.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.569
We have any idea how we do that?

19:55.652 --> 19:58.572
Well, we got to get a judge that's
willing to jump off a cliff with us.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.449
-Diaz.
-Diaz.

20:06.830 --> 20:08.999
Really, Rosilla? On my day off?

20:09.082 --> 20:11.210
We wouldn't bug you
unless we really needed the warrant.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.086
And we come with a gift.

20:13.962 --> 20:16.673
A Cuban sandwich
from your favorite spot.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.675
Bon appetit.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.052
Nice boat.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.765
The TTX found in our victim
was synthetic.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.017
Now, if the TTX from Len Corp
has the same composition,

20:27.100 --> 20:28.518
we're looking
at a pathological smoking gun.

20:28.602 --> 20:31.313
Len Corp wouldn't give us a sample,
so we're gonna need a warrant.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.524
Judge Diaz, look, we're looking
at two competitive filmmakers

20:34.608 --> 20:35.776
who disagreed on everything

20:35.859 --> 20:38.987
except that Len Corp
was probably hurting innocent people.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.031
I'm sorry.

20:41.114 --> 20:42.032
I'm not sold on this.

20:42.115 --> 20:45.285
Fight for the truth,
investigate relentlessly.

20:45.744 --> 20:46.995
That's what Emmitt's mom taught us.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.413
She was our journalism teacher

20:48.497 --> 20:50.999
even though they were stupid rich
and she didn't need the gig.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.919
She loved working with kids,
and she saw something in me.

20:54.002 --> 20:56.546
So I made it my mission
to own that class,

20:56.630 --> 20:57.798
and I crushed it.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.299
That just made Emmitt jealous,

20:59.383 --> 21:02.010
so he made it his mission
to take me down.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.638
That just got me pumped. It drove me.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.140
I am who I am because of them.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.519
She lit the fire,
and he fanned the flame.

21:11.186 --> 21:14.773
I I.D.'d Emmitt's body
so his own mother wouldn't have to.

21:14.856 --> 21:17.567
And I am bringing her answers
as to what happened to her son,

21:17.651 --> 21:18.860
come hell or high water,

21:18.944 --> 21:22.823
so, please, Judge Diaz,
please help us fight for the truth.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.451
All right.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.953
You've got your warrant.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.079
Thank you.

21:30.163 --> 21:31.415
Thank you.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.797
The TTX from Len Corp didn't match
the sample from you or Emmitt.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.925
Okay. If they didn't come after me,

21:42.009 --> 21:45.345
I guess we should start looking at
everyone else who wanted to do me in.

21:45.429 --> 21:47.723
The Len Corp C.E.O,
he didn't know Emmitt, right?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.850
-So maybe--
-He was onto a different story.

21:50.767 --> 21:52.519
The EMPD looked at his home computer.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.896
Someone deleted
all of his video files.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.441
Whatever he was working on,
they wanted that kept secret.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.904
-Yeah.
-Get down to Emmitt's office.

22:02.988 --> 22:05.240
I know what his documentary
was really about.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.867
We're on our way.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.414
All right, we're here.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.498
What was Emmitt's story?

22:13.582 --> 22:15.751
Not what. Who.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.962
Emmitt was investigating you, Naomi.

22:20.297 --> 22:24.301
Well, um, this isn't creepy at all.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.105
I've never thought about
what it's like for my subjects

22:37.189 --> 22:39.107
when I poke around in their lives.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.567
You owe an apology?

22:41.693 --> 22:42.819
Yeah, a big one.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.489
I just wish I could ask Emmitt
why he was investigating me.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.699
I mean, maybe he wanted
to get inside your head.

22:47.783 --> 22:49.368
Find a way to outdo you.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.411
Or the admiration grew
out of the competition.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.372
he found something in you
that intrigued him.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.957
Really? You're disagreeing with me
in front of our guest?

22:56.041 --> 22:58.293
Guest? I resuscitated her
on my autopsy table.

22:58.585 --> 22:59.461
She's family now.

22:59.544 --> 23:02.881
Does anything in your life
stick out as a motive for murder?

23:02.964 --> 23:05.634
No. I grew up in a small town.

23:05.717 --> 23:07.427
We knew each other pretty well.

23:07.511 --> 23:09.221
I can't think of anything
that would...

23:10.639 --> 23:11.765
I know that look.

23:11.848 --> 23:13.892
I have that look,
that's a family look. What do you got?

23:14.726 --> 23:16.520
I don't know where I came from.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.064
I'm sorry. What?

23:19.147 --> 23:20.982
I grew up in the system.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.651
I was bounced around in foster care.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.404
My mom dropped me off at a hospital
when I was a baby.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.239
I don't know anything else.
Maybe that's...

23:27.322 --> 23:30.242
You... You never looked into this?
Ever?

23:30.325 --> 23:33.870
I'm obsessive, okay, so
that search would consume me.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.207
I didn't want to get too lost
in my own story.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.501
There's so many others to tell.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.712
Now it looks like
I don't have a choice.

23:42.796 --> 23:43.797
Well, but you've got help,

23:43.880 --> 23:46.007
so you don't have to dive
into your past alone.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.843
We need to figure out
where Emmitt was searching.

23:47.926 --> 23:49.886
The killer moved his body
for a reason.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.931
The crime scene could
be a clue to your past.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.684
Naomi, you okay?

23:55.767 --> 23:57.436
What's that smell?

23:58.687 --> 24:00.063
What smell?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.898
Where is that light coming from?

24:01.982 --> 24:03.316
Villa, call 911.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.152
Naomi, lay down.
I need you to lay down.

24:05.235 --> 24:06.486
What? Why?

24:06.570 --> 24:08.196
'Cause you're about to have a seizure.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.364
What?

24:13.618 --> 24:14.786
I have an emergency.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.955
So, we're gonna continue doing...

24:17.038 --> 24:18.498
-All right, thanks.
-You got it.

24:20.667 --> 24:23.712
It says here that seizures
are a side effect of TTX.

24:23.795 --> 24:25.172
So it's still in my system?

24:25.255 --> 24:27.591
Your doctor and I, we think
there's something else going on.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.595
Your bleeding was spontaneous,
and that is not a sign of TTX.

24:32.345 --> 24:37.142
So we think that the TTX triggered
a previously asymptomatic condition

24:37.225 --> 24:40.061
that's causing your seizures
and all your other problems.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.981
Hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias,

24:43.064 --> 24:44.232
and your respiratory arrest.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.193
Do you have any idea
what the condition is?

24:46.276 --> 24:49.196
No, it's an unusual set of symptoms
that makes it seem genetic.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.781
Normally, we would pull
your family history.

24:52.115 --> 24:54.159
Right, but I... I'm a foster kid.

24:54.618 --> 24:55.744
Naomi...

24:56.995 --> 24:58.705
if we don't get a handle on this...

25:00.207 --> 25:01.666
you may not make it.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.670
We don't know, but it may not be long.

25:09.341 --> 25:10.717
Naomi, no.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.552
Naomi, you're not going anywhere.

25:12.636 --> 25:15.305
Yeah, well, if I only
have a little time left,

25:15.388 --> 25:17.057
I'm not spending it in here.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.141
Okay, we need you to stay.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.310
If someone told you you had to get...

25:20.393 --> 25:22.062
your house in order...

25:22.938 --> 25:25.524
would you sit around and do nothing,
or would you keep yourself busy

25:25.607 --> 25:27.192
so you don't have to think
about how scared you are?

25:27.275 --> 25:28.693
Well, if they need to run
some more tests--

25:28.777 --> 25:30.195
Oh, then I'll come back, I promise.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.447
We'll trace where Emmitt's
investigation took him.

25:32.531 --> 25:35.116
If we can find out who murdered him,
we may be able to save your life.

25:35.575 --> 25:37.452
Whoever it is,
they know where you're from.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.079
Yeah, that's my crew.
They can come in.

25:39.162 --> 25:40.163
-Knock, knock.
-Hey.

25:40.247 --> 25:41.748
We come bearing gifts.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.084
Flowers, balloons, some junk food.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.419
And Semprex-D.

25:46.503 --> 25:48.964
Figure you've probably been off
your allergy meds a few days.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.801
Yeah, no, the only thing I need
from that list is the Semprex-D.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.845
I'm blowing this joint.
We're going back to work, okay?

25:55.929 --> 25:58.515
Oh, hell yeah! I hate hospitals.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.350
-I'll grab your clothes.
-Thank you.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.477
Excuse me, nurse?
Naomi needs her clothing.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.521
-Hey, I got something to show you.
-What's that?

26:04.604 --> 26:06.565
-Uh, I got this footage.
-Oh!

26:06.648 --> 26:07.899
-It's pretty sweet.
-Looks fantastic.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.111
I'm keeping a uni by your side,
and that's non-negotiable.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.654
We're at a dead end on this case,

26:12.737 --> 26:14.739
but I'll give you an update
when we have one.

26:15.407 --> 26:16.825
Please and thank you...

26:16.908 --> 26:18.076
both of you.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.037
-Cool, right?
-Yeah, that looks amazing.

26:21.121 --> 26:22.205
Yeah, I got that wide.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.308
Hey, boss man, you're just in time.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.643
Team MCL has found something.

26:44.311 --> 26:47.147
This clue is part cool, part weird,
but full awesome.

26:47.230 --> 26:48.315
Hey, can you just take it down
a notch?

26:48.398 --> 26:50.817
I can only promise you that I
will not bring it up another notch.

26:50.900 --> 26:51.985
Okay, let's see what you got.

26:52.068 --> 26:53.236
There's a life that hangs
in the balance.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.405
Okay. You ready for this?

26:57.574 --> 27:00.785
Okay, so we found nematodes
in the cuts on his arms.

27:00.869 --> 27:03.830
And once inside a host,
they release a bacteria which glows.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.957
Unfortunately,
nematodes are widely found in soil,

27:06.041 --> 27:07.334
so he could have picked
them up anywhere,

27:07.417 --> 27:09.878
and we can't use them
to find the crime scene.

27:09.961 --> 27:12.339
But it does confirm
that wherever he was,

27:12.422 --> 27:14.633
he was exposed to soil
for an extended period of time.

27:14.716 --> 27:16.009
And the seeds in Emmitt's clothes?

27:16.092 --> 27:18.136
Are from a rare mule-ear orchid.

27:18.219 --> 27:19.220
And I did some research,

27:19.304 --> 27:21.848
and I found a conservation group
that keeps tabs on where they grow.

27:21.931 --> 27:24.517
Giving us a list of areas
Emmitt could have been searching.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.936
-Bingo.
-You guys all do such a great job.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.356
Wow. This makes little
to no sense.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.358
Why the hell would Emmitt
be searching out here?

27:31.441 --> 27:34.402
Well, I guess your rivalry with him
was deeper than you thought.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.737
I get that level of obsession.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.530
Okay, I don't think
we need to hear about your...

27:37.614 --> 27:39.616
When I was a detective,
Naomi, the first time...

27:39.824 --> 27:40.700
Yeah?

27:40.784 --> 27:43.161
...my rival was a dealer
named Remy Brasco.

27:43.244 --> 27:44.663
Maybe we should save this story
for another day.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.831
I couldn't make any charges stick,

27:46.915 --> 27:48.750
so he would throw it in my face
every chance he got.

27:48.833 --> 27:51.961
So I worked day and night
to take this guy down.

27:52.045 --> 27:53.338
Please tell me that you got the guy,
Ira.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.091
Otherwise, I'm gonna have to teach you
how to tell stories, my man.

27:56.174 --> 27:57.342
I got him.

27:58.551 --> 28:01.388
But it took time away from my family
I could never get back.

28:01.471 --> 28:04.182
That landed in a real way.
Sign of a good storyteller.

28:04.265 --> 28:06.851
Thank you for sharing the story
about your rival.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.396
I didn't have a rival.
Seriously, I didn't.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.481
But it looks like we found something.

28:13.733 --> 28:16.820
Hey, Steinbeck, after you.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.750
I'll check upstairs.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.049
Can't believe people lived here.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.844
Whoever they were, they must
have left this place in a hurry.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.429
Makes you wonder what went down here.

28:50.645 --> 28:52.397
Anybody recognize this guy?

28:53.314 --> 28:56.067
I do. That's John Teller.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.653
He's that religious cult leader
from the '80's.

28:59.821 --> 29:03.533
He started off with college kids,
then moved to recruiting families.

29:07.912 --> 29:10.081
He stripped them of their identity,
new names.

29:10.165 --> 29:13.418
Stripped of their identity,
gave them new names, new clothes.

29:13.501 --> 29:15.628
Men in pink, women in blue.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.338
I'll never forget that.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.134
He had them convinced
they were part of a supreme being.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.553
He ruined their lives.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.435
John Teller and his followers

29:30.518 --> 29:32.937
spent years in the public eye,
and then...

29:34.105 --> 29:36.441
the cult just dropped off the grid.

29:37.108 --> 29:38.693
Wow, this must be where
they set up shop

29:38.777 --> 29:40.278
and murdered all those people.

29:40.945 --> 29:43.198
And most of the bodies
were never found.

29:46.993 --> 29:49.996
Okay, but what does this have
to do with Emmitt and Naomi?

29:50.079 --> 29:52.040
I think I have the answer to that.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.667
Naomi, what's wrong?

29:55.752 --> 29:57.378
The baby in that picture...

29:59.589 --> 30:01.090
has my birthmark.

30:04.260 --> 30:07.013
My life started
in the John Teller murder house.

30:13.228 --> 30:15.063
I can't believe you
already identified my mom.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.315
Everything is set up
in the conference room.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.863
I...

30:24.656 --> 30:26.825
When I said I didn't look into my past

30:26.908 --> 30:29.702
because I didn't want to
be consumed by my story,

30:29.786 --> 30:31.454
that was only partly true.

30:33.039 --> 30:35.208
I was scared that...

30:35.750 --> 30:38.837
I would learn something horrible
about where I came from.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.589
And I guess I really hit the mark
on that.

30:41.673 --> 30:43.049
Look, I know...

30:43.424 --> 30:46.553
I know this is hard,
but you'll get through it.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.515
I'm just... still wrapping
my head around

30:50.890 --> 30:53.184
living in the Teller murder house

30:53.268 --> 30:56.145
and Emmitt's death
and the attempt on my life and...

30:57.272 --> 30:58.898
well, what's left of it.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.068
I can't do this.

31:02.735 --> 31:04.946
Yesterday, we couldn't get rid of you,

31:05.029 --> 31:06.197
and now you're just bolting?

31:06.281 --> 31:07.282
Don't go there.

31:07.365 --> 31:09.325
Walk in my shoes, and then
maybe you and I can talk.

31:09.409 --> 31:12.996
Look, I can't even imagine...
what it's like to walk in your shoes,

31:13.079 --> 31:17.417
but what if you had a subject
who was scared...

31:17.500 --> 31:21.462
with a story that needed to be told,
but not much time left to tell it?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.298
What would you tell them?

31:25.216 --> 31:27.385
That you have to meet
your past head-on.

31:29.846 --> 31:32.891
That if you are truly
at the end of your life,

31:32.974 --> 31:36.311
you owe it to yourself
to see how it began.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.438
That fear isn't an option.

31:38.521 --> 31:39.606
There you go.

31:43.443 --> 31:45.361
Naomi, we identified your mom.

31:45.445 --> 31:46.613
Her name was Colleen Brady.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.448
She was a college student at EMU

31:48.531 --> 31:50.366
around the time Teller started
his cult.

31:50.450 --> 31:53.244
The photo from the missing-persons
report her parents filed

31:53.328 --> 31:54.746
matched the woman in your baby photo.

31:54.829 --> 31:57.582
Now, unfortunately, your grandparents
were cremated five years ago,

31:57.665 --> 31:59.459
so there's no other
immediate relatives.

32:00.043 --> 32:02.587
So in order to get a family history
to save me,

32:02.670 --> 32:04.505
we have to find her.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.507
Teller's adult followers
are in prison.

32:06.591 --> 32:08.009
Is that where she ended up?

32:08.092 --> 32:11.679
Photos from the day Teller
and his followers were arrested...

32:11.763 --> 32:13.139
Colleen isn't with them.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.516
The FBI made their case against Teller

32:15.600 --> 32:17.936
because they got information
from an inside source.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.855
You think my mom is the inside source?

32:21.272 --> 32:24.233
And you think Teller
found out and killed her?

32:24.317 --> 32:26.569
Well, if that's true, Teller dumped
his victims in the woods.

32:26.653 --> 32:27.654
Colleen could be anywhere.

32:27.737 --> 32:28.947
Well, we were gonna take
a ride upstate

32:29.030 --> 32:31.199
to see if we could get one
of Teller's followers to talk.

32:31.282 --> 32:33.868
But then we realized Emmitt
probably already did that.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.453
I bet those cuts on Emmitt's arms

32:35.536 --> 32:37.497
are from the fence
surrounding the murder house.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.624
That's how those nematodes
got into his body.

32:39.707 --> 32:42.877
And the glowing bacteria is the result
of prolonged exposure in the soil.

32:42.961 --> 32:44.587
Like from excess digging.

32:45.213 --> 32:48.299
Emmitt was looking for my mom's
remains at the murder house.

32:59.185 --> 33:02.313
Why would my mom go back to the cult
after getting me out?

33:02.897 --> 33:04.774
She could have just kept running.

33:08.194 --> 33:11.239
Maybe she thought the only way to be
free was if Teller was behind bars.

33:11.322 --> 33:13.992
And working with the FBI
was her best chance of doing that

33:14.075 --> 33:15.159
and seeing you again.

33:15.243 --> 33:17.370
Whatever happens, take comfort
knowing that your mother

33:17.453 --> 33:19.580
risked her life to make
sure that you were safe.

33:20.331 --> 33:21.749
We got something.

33:25.628 --> 33:27.714
There are the orchids.
Emmitt was here.

33:36.431 --> 33:37.640
There's remains down there.

33:45.231 --> 33:46.649
If Colleen has anything genetic,

33:46.733 --> 33:48.693
that information might help us
save Naomi.

33:48.776 --> 33:49.861
So let's get to work.

33:49.944 --> 33:50.987
Yeah.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.464
See this stain on the skull?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.424
Blunt force trauma. Look at that.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.009
That's probably how she died.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.387
Hey, thanks for the extra training.

34:17.972 --> 34:20.600
Sorry I went full-science fan boy
on you yesterday.

34:20.683 --> 34:23.186
I-I just don't want you to think
that I'm not totally focused.

34:23.269 --> 34:24.520
No. No need to apologize.

34:25.104 --> 34:27.523
I love your passion
and your unique prism.

34:28.191 --> 34:30.359
You are a fan club of one.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.487
But my prism gets me teased daily.

34:32.570 --> 34:34.739
Yeah, I've noticed, and I can relate.

34:34.822 --> 34:37.950
The way we see the world is
what makes us good at what we do.

34:38.034 --> 34:40.787
And I depend on you more
than you realize, so...

34:40.870 --> 34:42.538
don't ever lose that Mitchie prism.

34:43.956 --> 34:45.500
So I guess we're two peas in a pod?

34:45.583 --> 34:47.919
More like two peas, adjacent pods.

34:48.002 --> 34:49.420
Yeah. I'm good with that.

34:50.296 --> 34:53.883
All right, so, DNA confirms that these
remains belong to Naomi's mom.

34:53.966 --> 34:56.969
And there's an inhomogeneity
in the density of the pelvic bone.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.681
Bone disease. But which one?

35:00.765 --> 35:02.100
What does the bone biopsy show?

35:02.517 --> 35:03.893
On it already.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.356
Your mother had bone cancer.

35:08.439 --> 35:11.067
And like her, you have
Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

35:11.150 --> 35:12.235
Makes you prone to tumors.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.945
We found one
in your left adrenal gland.

35:14.028 --> 35:16.948
So that's what was causing
the bleeding and everything else?

35:17.031 --> 35:19.700
They'll take it out and monitor it
to make sure no more appear.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.327
Now, I know this sounds scary, Naomi,

35:21.410 --> 35:22.870
but you're gonna be just fine.

35:24.497 --> 35:25.998
Well, you saved my life again.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.462
Did you use that humidifier
the night before your paralysis?

35:32.088 --> 35:35.341
Yeah. Yeah, up until all of this
happened, I used it every night.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.135
Why? Why?

35:46.102 --> 35:47.270
I think I know how you were poisoned.

35:52.900 --> 35:54.902
I was the rich kid who had everything.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.114
Naomi was the foster kid
who bounced from home to home.

35:58.698 --> 35:59.907
The more we competed,

35:59.991 --> 36:03.411
the more I realized
that Naomi is the better filmmaker.

36:04.662 --> 36:06.706
She has this innate sense of story.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.708
Thanks for being here.

36:08.791 --> 36:10.418
I didn't want to watch this alone.

36:10.501 --> 36:11.711
This is crazy.

36:11.794 --> 36:13.296
It's just getting started.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.590
And I had become intrigued by her.

36:16.424 --> 36:19.427
She fights to tell everyone
else's story, but not her own.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.220
And the more I thought about that,

36:21.304 --> 36:24.015
the more I loved the idea
of telling the one story

36:24.098 --> 36:26.267
Naomi was unwilling to tell

36:26.350 --> 36:29.604
not to get back at her,
but to earn her respect,

36:29.687 --> 36:32.398
to help her close a chapter
in her life.

36:32.481 --> 36:34.483
Emmitt didn't get a chance
to finish his documentary.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.737
So I decided to finish it for him.

36:37.820 --> 36:40.865
He learned that Naomi's mother
was Colleen Brady,

36:40.948 --> 36:43.075
and that she was a member
of John Teller's cult.

36:43.159 --> 36:47.038
He believed Colleen was killed by John
because she betrayed him to the FBI

36:47.121 --> 36:49.165
and that her body
was buried in the woods.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.792
Emmitt didn't just find
Teller's followers,

36:51.876 --> 36:54.587
he also tracked down everyone
that lived in the murder house.

36:54.670 --> 36:57.548
And John Teller had a son

36:57.632 --> 37:00.885
who went into foster care
when his dad got arrested.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.136
And guess what?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.847
Emmitt found him living right here
in Miami.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.600
Filled him in on Naomi
and his documentary.

37:12.188 --> 37:13.981
Hold on. We're not finished.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.816
You couldn't punish Colleen
for sending your father to prison,

37:15.900 --> 37:17.777
but you could take out revenge
on her daughter.

37:17.860 --> 37:20.112
So you joined my crew,
got close to me,

37:20.196 --> 37:22.031
and almost committed
the perfect murder.

37:22.114 --> 37:25.076
But you didn't count on
Naomi surviving, right?

37:25.660 --> 37:27.328
Which meant you had
to kill Emmitt, too,

37:27.411 --> 37:28.871
because you knew he would
piece it all together.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.873
So you followed him
to the murder house, you dosed him,

37:30.957 --> 37:33.167
then you moved him back to his house
to avoid suspicion.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.379
Dmitry, we found TTX
on the water reservoir

37:36.462 --> 37:38.339
and your prints on the outside
of the tank.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.801
Your mom ruined my life,

37:42.468 --> 37:44.428
and I lost my dad because of her.

37:45.096 --> 37:47.723
Give him my regards
when you see him in prison.

37:59.902 --> 38:01.070
Good afternoon, Mom.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.656
Hi.

38:04.031 --> 38:06.826
Look... I know that you're here
to meet

38:07.243 --> 38:08.995
-with the potential investor, but--
-True.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.000
But why don't you seem
surprised to see me?

38:14.458 --> 38:15.960
I'm not because...

38:16.377 --> 38:17.670
you are the investor.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.299
When did you find out?

38:21.632 --> 38:24.218
The minute that you said that
the investor studied economics.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.803
I mean, come on, Mom. I know you.

38:25.886 --> 38:27.680
Well, you could have said something!

38:27.763 --> 38:30.641
Oh, a story about a pot
and a kettle comes to mind.

38:30.725 --> 38:33.227
I was just afraid that if I came
to you directly, you would...

38:33.311 --> 38:35.479
You thought I'd say,
"Stay in your lane."

38:35.563 --> 38:36.689
Yes. Why didn't you?

38:36.772 --> 38:38.316
Well, because the more
that I thought about it,

38:38.399 --> 38:39.608
the more it made sense.

38:39.692 --> 38:40.693
And, it's like you said,

38:40.776 --> 38:42.611
I have to have faith
that being in business together

38:42.695 --> 38:44.947
is not gonna affect us
being mother and son.

38:45.948 --> 38:48.576
Where'd you even get the money
to even think about doing this?

38:49.577 --> 38:53.622
Gerald got a settlement from the state
for wrongful imprisonment.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.749
He...

38:55.333 --> 38:56.834
He paid me back with interest

38:57.543 --> 38:59.837
for the money I invested
in his defense.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.674
Now, are you sure
you want to be my partner?

39:04.508 --> 39:06.135
'Cause you could do anything
with that money.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.179
Son...

39:08.763 --> 39:12.975
I can't do very much
to ease your physical pain.

39:14.810 --> 39:17.021
And if your health,

39:17.480 --> 39:19.899
you know, takes its toll again,
then...

39:21.567 --> 39:24.153
at least you'll know
the lab is in good hands.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.077
So we're doing this?

39:32.828 --> 39:34.497
Yes, we are.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.095
Rosie!

39:49.553 --> 39:50.638
What are you doing here?

39:50.721 --> 39:53.808
Well, I just thought I'd stop by,
check in on you before your surgery.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.518
You nervous?

39:56.227 --> 39:59.563
Yesterday, I didn't think
I'd see tomorrow, so...

40:00.314 --> 40:02.608
Well, I'm not scared of
going under the knife.

40:05.569 --> 40:07.780
You know reading people
is one of my gifts, right?

40:07.863 --> 40:11.033
Oh, I know,
and being unreadable is one of mine.

40:11.867 --> 40:14.870
Not today.
I figured out who your rival is.

40:15.454 --> 40:17.123
-I don't have a rival.
-You do.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.667
It's not an old classmate.

40:20.709 --> 40:22.086
Your rival is you.

40:22.670 --> 40:24.505
More accurately, your health.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.052
Been going neck and neck
with it my entire life.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.931
I just don't know how
much longer I can do it.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.891
I'm just tired.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.185
You're not tired.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.271
You're David...

40:40.896 --> 40:42.606
staring down a giant.

40:43.899 --> 40:46.569
I need you to load that slingshot
one more time.

40:47.486 --> 40:49.905
I mean, you've beat Goliath before.
You can do it again.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.079
So, what are you gonna do next?

40:57.746 --> 40:59.123
I don't know.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.459
Make some more films.

41:02.460 --> 41:05.004
Search for long-lost relatives.

41:07.047 --> 41:09.467
What? What's this Rosie smile about?

41:09.550 --> 41:12.761
Well, let's just say you're not
the only one who can read people.

41:17.224 --> 41:18.225
No.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.519
Long-lost relatives?

41:21.979 --> 41:23.314
Oh, my God!

41:23.397 --> 41:24.940
-Hey.
-Hi!

41:25.566 --> 41:27.902
-Um, I'm Naomi.
-It's so nice to meet you.

41:27.985 --> 41:30.196
Oh, my goodness. Thank you, guys.

41:33.407 --> 41:36.410
Pleased to meet you.
I hope I don't die in surgery.

41:49.006 --> 41:50.174
Rosie?

41:50.257 --> 41:51.383
Rosie?

41:52.051 --> 41:53.427
You okay?

41:58.807 --> 42:00.351
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.
