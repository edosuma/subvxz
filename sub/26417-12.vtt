WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:03.971
So how do we feel
about these aviators?

00:04.004 --> 00:06.307
I think I look great,
like a business pilot.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.509
They're a bit
serial killer-y.

00:08.542 --> 00:11.312
Okay. Good feedback.
Tad harsh, but fair.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.315
So then, how about
these browline clubmasters?

00:14.348 --> 00:16.484
Style on top,
substance down below.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.319
Have you considered
a monocle?

00:18.352 --> 00:20.088
You could be
like Mr. Peanut!

00:20.121 --> 00:21.655
What's up with the glasses
anyways, Dad?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.357
You're always touting
your 20/20 vision.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.025
Well, I'm excited
to report

00:25.059 --> 00:26.494
those clear-seeing days
are over

00:26.527 --> 00:28.096
because I'm turning 40!

00:28.129 --> 00:30.564
The age one's vision
officially begins to fail.

00:30.598 --> 00:32.766
I will never
fail an eye exam

00:32.800 --> 00:35.336
because I have memorized
the letter board.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.005
E, F-P, T-O-Z,

00:38.038 --> 00:41.041
P-D-L-E, D-E-F-Z-C,

00:41.075 --> 00:43.544
F-C-Z-D-E-P.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.514
Well, I'm excited
for glasses.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.049
I can finally look
as wise as I feel.

00:50.118 --> 00:51.852
The waiting's
the hardest part.

00:51.885 --> 00:52.853
See? Wisdom.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.222
Glasses
or no glasses,

00:54.255 --> 00:55.723
how are we gonna
celebrate your birthday?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.225
I'm thinking

00:57.258 --> 00:58.859
yacht ride.
* Yeah

00:58.892 --> 01:01.129
I've already decided
on the perfect plan.

01:02.096 --> 01:03.197
Camping!

01:06.467 --> 01:08.869
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:08.902 --> 01:10.037
* Fresh off the boat

01:10.070 --> 01:11.705
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

01:11.739 --> 01:14.041
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

01:14.074 --> 01:15.276
* Fresh off the boat

01:15.309 --> 01:17.611
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

01:17.645 --> 01:19.079
* But I know where I'm goin'

01:19.113 --> 01:21.849
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:22.583 --> 01:25.553
Dad, have you ever
been camping before?

01:25.586 --> 01:28.055
-No.
-Then where did this come from?

01:28.088 --> 01:29.657
I just watched
"Legends of the Fall,"

01:29.690 --> 01:31.392
and I can't stop
thinking about it.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.893
The big sky,
the rugged land,

01:32.926 --> 01:35.062
the raw emotions,
and then it hit me.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.731
I want to spend my 40th
in the great outdoors.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.167
Is this like when you watched
the movie "Roger Rabbit"

01:39.200 --> 01:40.401
and wanted a rabbit?

01:40.434 --> 01:42.403
No, I just think
it'll be fun to explore

01:42.436 --> 01:44.004
the frontier as a family.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.440
What kind of role does
the mother character

01:46.474 --> 01:48.309
play in this film?
Mm...

01:48.342 --> 01:50.077
None, really.
She abandoned the family.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.078
Perfect.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.981
So no camping for me
in this reenactment.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.115
Such a shame.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.153
Looks like it's gonna be
only us Huang men

01:59.187 --> 02:00.421
out in the wilderness.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.089
We'll be just like
the Ludlows --

02:02.122 --> 02:04.425
Anthony Hopkins,
Brad Pitt,

02:04.458 --> 02:06.427
those two other guys.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.506
Howdy.
Glad you made it.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.274
Careful where you step.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.676
This horse just
took a huge dump.

02:27.715 --> 02:30.218
To be Brad Pitt,
even for a day...

02:32.052 --> 02:33.187
Anyway. Camping.
Cool, right?

02:33.221 --> 02:34.788
Yeah, Dad.
Super cool.

02:34.822 --> 02:36.457
Totally.
Camping sounds awesome.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.725
Yeah,
super totally.

02:37.758 --> 02:40.160
Great! I'll grab a map
and start a gear list.

02:40.194 --> 02:42.896
It will be comprehensive
because we don't have any gear.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.498
Oh, uh, Ma.
Did you want to --

02:47.501 --> 02:50.638
There are no canoes
in "Legend of the Fall."

02:57.010 --> 02:58.011
G-7.
Miss.

02:58.045 --> 02:59.747
Ugh, another miss?

02:59.780 --> 03:02.383
How?
I haven't had a single hit

03:02.416 --> 03:04.318
in nearly an hour.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.853
Wait. Are you moving
the ships?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.721
They're under attack.
Why would they stay still?

03:07.755 --> 03:10.824
Jessica, you can't --

03:10.858 --> 03:11.859
You know what?
It's fine.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.327
I'm just happy
to be playing at all.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.595
Marvin doesn't play?

03:14.628 --> 03:15.996
I thought
he was in the Navy.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.665
I got this for
Marvin's birthday one year,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.333
and he totally
freaked out.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.736
He said, "There's no way four
shots could sink a battleship."

03:22.770 --> 03:23.737
-Hmm.
-Oh, speaking of birthdays,

03:23.771 --> 03:25.706
what did you get Louis
for his 40th?

03:25.739 --> 03:27.341
What I always get him.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.342
A tie.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.444
A tie?

03:30.478 --> 03:32.746
Don't you want to get him
something a little nicer?

03:32.780 --> 03:34.448
I thought about
getting it monogrammed,

03:34.482 --> 03:36.350
but I don't like
his initials.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.019
I just mean turning 40
is a big deal.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.087
If this were
the Middle Ages,

03:40.120 --> 03:41.555
he'd be the oldest person
in the world.

03:41.589 --> 03:44.925
Well, it's not the Middle Ages.
Everyone turns 40 these days.

03:44.958 --> 03:47.027
You hit triple digits,
then we will talk.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.630
B-3.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.065
Hit.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.536
You sunk my destroyer.
That's the last of my fleet.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.871
Still undefeated
at children's board games!

04:00.107 --> 04:02.743
What are we gonna do about
Dad's terrible camping idea?

04:02.776 --> 04:03.911
I guess
we suck it up.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.946
I'm already practicing
my fake enthusiasm.

04:05.979 --> 04:09.149
"Whoa, if that's Orion's Belt,
where are his pants?"

04:09.182 --> 04:11.619
No way. I'm not spending
my weekend outside.

04:11.652 --> 04:14.588
I can't pee when I know
there could be animals watching.

04:14.622 --> 04:15.656
Exactly.
Camping is hard,

04:15.689 --> 04:17.591
and birthdays are
supposed to be fun.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.427
What choice do we have?
It's Dad's birthday.

04:19.460 --> 04:20.561
He gets to decide.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.062
That's why we have
to convince him

04:22.095 --> 04:23.564
to decide
to do something else,

04:23.597 --> 04:24.898
like throwing a party.

04:24.932 --> 04:28.235
Ooh. Bring on the birthday cake
and Shirley Temples.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.170
Man, I love
Shirley Temples!

04:31.705 --> 04:32.973
That was real enthusiasm!

04:33.006 --> 04:34.408
Then we're agreed.

04:34.442 --> 04:36.610
What Dad really wants to do
is have a party.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.779
Great because I am not
sleeping on the ground.

04:38.812 --> 04:41.248
You think this posture
just happens?

04:43.951 --> 04:45.753
Honey, I know
you're pregnant again,

04:45.786 --> 04:48.255
but we need to set limits
on your cravings-requests.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.357
I was just here --

04:49.390 --> 04:51.325
Have a seat, Jessica.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.097
Marvin and I were talking,

04:57.130 --> 04:58.265
and, out of love,

04:58.298 --> 05:00.768
we wanted to discuss
your gift-giving habits.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.537
Think of this
as an intervention.

05:03.571 --> 05:04.638
A-A conversation.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.040
We're worried you're not
putting enough thought

05:07.074 --> 05:08.542
into Louis'
birthday gift.

05:08.576 --> 05:09.777
You should get him
something

05:09.810 --> 05:11.211
a little more personal
than a tie.

05:11.244 --> 05:12.546
Mm-hmm.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.648
Like the game "Battleship"?
-Please don't --

05:14.682 --> 05:17.718
Ugh, I think that "Battleship"
is a trash game.
Here we go.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.521
To reduce the Navy
to a plastic grid

05:20.554 --> 05:22.656
of numbers and letters.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.791
What a farce.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.893
Sweetheart,
it's a classic game.

05:25.926 --> 05:29.129
Everyone loves it.
Oh, does everyone know
how vast the ocean is?

05:29.162 --> 05:30.297
How complex?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.799
It's a living,
breathing organism,

05:31.832 --> 05:32.800
for goodness' sake.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.803
Back to Louis'
birthday gift...

05:35.836 --> 05:37.237
I know my husband,

05:37.270 --> 05:39.206
and I know he doesn't want
a fuss made over him,

05:39.239 --> 05:40.841
so no big parties.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.043
No horse that does tricks.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.745
No sentimental gifts
from me.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.814
But the 40th
is different, Jessica.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.216
You -- You begin to see life
in an entirely new way.

05:49.249 --> 05:52.085
Like my old diesel mechanic
used to say,

05:52.119 --> 05:54.888
"On that day,
you're not over the hill.

05:54.922 --> 05:55.856
You're on top of it."

05:55.889 --> 05:57.425
That's beautiful,
sugar bear.

05:57.458 --> 05:58.692
I miss that garage.
Aww.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.993
I grew up there

06:00.027 --> 06:04.031
in ways that I should
probably keep to myself.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.099
So what did you get Louis?

06:06.133 --> 06:08.502
Oh, I got him
a top-of-the-line,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.270
American felling ax.

06:10.303 --> 06:12.740
It represents the importance
of exploring the world

06:12.773 --> 06:15.409
and building a life
no matter how old you get.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.910
Well, if you're such
gift experts,

06:16.944 --> 06:19.046
what'd you get Marvin
when he turned 40?

06:19.079 --> 06:20.881
Uh...

06:21.815 --> 06:23.216
I was 8.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.285
So nothing then.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.424
Hey, boys.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.692
I'm getting us all knives

06:31.725 --> 06:34.528
for whittling
or maybe blood oaths.

06:34.562 --> 06:35.696
Sounds great, Dad.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.197
Also we were thinking
we could skip camping

06:37.230 --> 06:39.032
and throw a party here
in Orlando instead.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.268
No camping?
But you guys were so excited.

06:41.301 --> 06:43.771
And I was excited to
teach you guys things
you've never done --

06:43.804 --> 06:45.606
build a fire,
forage for berries,

06:45.639 --> 06:47.541
hang our clothes
on a branch while we swim.

06:47.575 --> 06:50.911
But, Dad,
this is your big 4-0.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.714
We should spend it celebrating
everything that makes you you.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.149
To list -- great friends,
great food,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.451
music and dancing.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.586
You love dancing.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.621
Weren't you
the Cha Cha King of Taipei?

07:00.654 --> 07:02.155
Can't dance
in the woods.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.457
I guess that's true.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.758
I wasn't burning firewood
in my day.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
I was burning up
dance floors.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.428
You give me a soft leather sole
and a beat,

07:08.462 --> 07:10.230
and I'd give you
the world.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.933
See? All we're saying
is it's your 40th.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.835
You should go big.
-And think about it.

07:14.868 --> 07:17.671
You won't get another milestone
birthday until you're 50.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.172
And who knows
where we'll all be by then?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.474
Evan: Yeah.
10 years from now,

07:20.508 --> 07:22.442
I could be
studying in Paris.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.945
Or at the rate I'm skipping
grades, governing it.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.947
Eddie:
And I'll probably be coming off
the bench for the Knicks.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.116
I mean, someone's got
to foul Shaq.

07:29.149 --> 07:32.185
I guess I never
thought of it that way.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.521
You know what?
Let's do it.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.355
I'd love to plan a party
with you guys.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.924
You sure you're down
for this?

07:36.957 --> 07:38.992
Is the hypotenuse
the longest side of a triangle?

07:39.860 --> 07:42.630
Yes.
The answer is yes.
Yes.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.634
I'm so glad
we pulled this off.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.602
I'm already thinking about
that Shirley Temple.

07:48.636 --> 07:51.338
The key is the two-to-one ratio
of grenadine to Sprite.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.773
Two to one?!

07:52.806 --> 07:54.775
Way too sweet!
What are you, a hummingbird?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.177
Hey, who's ready
to party...

07:57.210 --> 07:58.245
plan?

08:00.380 --> 08:02.449
Is this all
for one day?!

08:02.482 --> 08:03.483
Well, technically,
two days

08:03.517 --> 08:05.052
should the festivities
go past midnight,

08:05.085 --> 08:07.154
which they will,
if we do our jobs.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.222
Wait. When did camping
turn into a party?

08:09.256 --> 08:11.692
Oh, well, the boys
had a good point.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.661
You only turn 40 once.
It's a big deal.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.963
Anyway, I'll let you boys
look through this.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.731
I can't wait to brainstorm
my entrance song.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.700
I'm thinking
"Louie Louie."

08:27.507 --> 08:29.309
I thought he wanted
to keep it simple.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.078
Eddie: There are five pages
on color schemes.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.713
How many versions of gold
can there be?

08:32.746 --> 08:34.381
"Muted Champagne"?

08:34.414 --> 08:35.515
"October Wheat"?

08:35.549 --> 08:38.085
There's an entire section
called "Vibe."

08:38.118 --> 08:39.019
That's what caught your eye?

08:39.052 --> 08:40.020
Not the tab labeled

08:40.053 --> 08:42.222
"Coconut Bras --
question mark"?

08:42.255 --> 08:43.356
How did this happen?

08:43.390 --> 08:44.491
Camping sounded
like a lot,

08:44.524 --> 08:46.093
and Dad was into
the idea of a party.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.561
We thought
it would be easier.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.230
Well, you seem to have this
under control,

08:50.263 --> 08:51.531
so I'm just gonna
go to the kitchen

08:51.565 --> 08:52.532
and check on dinner.

08:58.538 --> 08:59.707
Honey,
we have a crisis.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.210
Louis does think his birthday
is a big deal.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.845
You were right.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.615
Maybe my giving him a tie
isn't personal enough.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.516
This is nothing
we can't fix.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.752
All you have to do is give him
something from the heart.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.021
Can I confess
something to you?

09:14.054 --> 09:16.256
Of course, Jessica.
Anything.

09:16.289 --> 09:17.424
I'm...

09:17.457 --> 09:19.426
not a sentimental
person.

09:19.459 --> 09:22.062
Ah, yeah.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.064
Well, lucky for you,

09:24.097 --> 09:25.899
pulling heartstrings
is a my jam.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.568
It's time for you to learn
about the "Love Languages."

09:28.602 --> 09:29.937
I went to
the University of Maryland.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.105
They're called
Romance languages.

09:32.139 --> 09:33.641
No, these are
the Love Languages.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.909
They're the ways that we express
affection to one another.

09:35.943 --> 09:38.545
It's all in there.
Can you just
tell me how it ends?

09:38.578 --> 09:40.313
Mm, it's not
that kind of book.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.882
Each chapter covers
a different method

09:41.915 --> 09:43.383
for expressing love.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.552
You just need to figure out
which one Louis responds to

09:45.585 --> 09:46.987
and then match his gift
to that.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.656
This really works?
Yeah.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.823
How do you think
Marvin and I

09:49.857 --> 09:51.124
got past
the "Battleship" debacle?

09:51.158 --> 09:53.093
Once I learned he values
"Acts of Service,"

09:53.126 --> 09:54.227
I started making his day

09:54.261 --> 09:56.730
by taping "Price Is Right"
when he was at work.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.599
And then, when he learned mine
was "Words of Affirmation,"

09:59.633 --> 10:02.469
he started writing me
the most amazing poems.

10:02.502 --> 10:05.605
Ugh, this all sounds
very "flower person" to me.

10:05.639 --> 10:07.174
It's "flower child,"

10:07.207 --> 10:08.642
and there's nothing hippie
about it.

10:08.676 --> 10:10.477
Hey, Honey. Oh, hi.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.079
I'm looking for
a long, sturdy box.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.280
The gift is hard to wrap.

10:13.313 --> 10:16.249
I already picked you up
a giant bow from the store.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.919
It's all you need!
-Oh, you're a genius, Honey.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.620
God, I love you.
-Aww.

10:21.655 --> 10:24.925
"Some Honey for this bee?

10:24.958 --> 10:27.194
Yesiree."

10:30.030 --> 10:31.264
Louis:
* Louie Louie

10:31.298 --> 10:33.934
* Oh, oh, turning 40, 40

10:33.967 --> 10:35.602
All right, guys.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.105
I already took care of section 9
in binder 2 --

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
Venue.
We'll host it at Cattleman's!

10:40.173 --> 10:42.475
-There's a section 9?
-There's a second binder?

10:42.509 --> 10:43.543
I'm kidding.

10:43.576 --> 10:45.112
Cattleman's
was always the venue.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.513
I just never
included it because

10:46.546 --> 10:48.782
I didn't want to waste
valuable space on the D-ring.

10:48.816 --> 10:50.383
Good one.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.619
All right. I'll go gather
all our extension cords,

10:52.652 --> 10:53.954
splitters,
and surge protectors.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.856
This party is really
gonna test the grid!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.226
This sucks.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.460
We should do
what we always do

11:00.493 --> 11:02.162
when we have an enormous amount
of schoolwork --

11:02.195 --> 11:03.831
buckle in
and do it all in one day.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.999
Like the time we knocked out
two English papers,

11:06.033 --> 11:07.367
a science experiment,

11:07.400 --> 11:09.336
and built the White House
out of sugar cubes.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.871
It opened up our Sunday
for filing

11:10.904 --> 11:12.873
Freedom of Information
requests.

11:12.906 --> 11:15.508
They may not have figured out
who shot JFK, but we will.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.745
You know,
once in a while,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.047
it's good to know nerds.
Let's do this.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.025
Um, what are you doing?

11:32.059 --> 11:34.494
Fluffing your pillow
to show you I care.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.263
But I like it
flat and limp.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.232
No.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.010
What's happening
right now?

11:50.043 --> 11:52.045
I'm expressing
physical touch.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.346
Are you
enjoying yourself?

11:53.380 --> 11:55.682
Are you?

12:00.587 --> 12:02.222
Good job
buttering that toast.

12:02.255 --> 12:04.958
Even spread right up
to the crust.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.059
Nice.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.229
Yes, I will
make you some, too.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.871
Writing all these
invitations wiped me out.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.040
I can't imagine how you made
all these cupcakes.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.909
I ate every fifth one
to keep my energy up.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.778
I gave those balloons
everything I had.

12:24.812 --> 12:25.779
Look, at least we're done.

12:26.814 --> 12:27.781
Whoa.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.482
You guys already
did this without me?

12:29.516 --> 12:31.284
I thought we were
gonna do it together.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.586
Well, now all that's
left to do is party.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.555
Wow, you guys are
really into this, huh?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.058
-Of course, we are.
-Yeah, anything for you, Dad.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.894
Well, now that you've
freed up all this time --

12:40.928 --> 12:42.229
let's dance!

12:42.262 --> 12:44.464
What?
I'm gonna teach you
the cha-cha,

12:44.497 --> 12:46.066
and we'll perform it together
at my party!

12:46.099 --> 12:47.567
-What?
-This is perfect.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.402
You know, I learned
when I was your age.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.504
But we're three
different ages.

12:51.538 --> 12:52.572
You guys said
this party is about

12:52.605 --> 12:54.074
celebrating
what makes me, me.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.508
And what makes me, me --

12:55.542 --> 12:56.576
cha-cha!

12:56.609 --> 12:59.112
Great. Great.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.818
Jessica,
what is this all about?

13:04.852 --> 13:08.288
I know it's not technically
your birthday yet,

13:08.321 --> 13:10.123
but I was
too excited to wait!

13:14.027 --> 13:15.595
Great card.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.464
Really great.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.607
Well,
what do you think?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.442
Jessica, I love it!

13:29.476 --> 13:30.777
For a second,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.779
I thought there was gonna be
a really big tie in there.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.448
Oh, no. What can I say?
You know, it's your 40th.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.685
The ax represents the importance
of exploring the world

13:38.718 --> 13:41.354
and building a life
no matter how old you get.

13:41.388 --> 13:44.291
A symbolic tool.
Amazing.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.893
Honey: Louis?

13:45.926 --> 13:47.027
Hey, Honey.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.529
Can you believe this amazing
gift Jessica got me?

13:49.562 --> 13:52.032
She knew just what I wanted
without even asking.

13:52.065 --> 13:53.800
Dad jokes. I'm 40.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.473
Wow.
An American felling ax.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.242
What a thoughtful gift.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.977
How did you
come up with that?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.812
Dream.
It came to me in a dream.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.147
Louis: Oh, if you think
this is thoughtful,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.016
wait till you hear what
she wrote in the card.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.850
No, no, Louis.

14:10.884 --> 14:12.152
Personal!
It's so personal.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.354
What it is
is beautiful.

14:14.387 --> 14:17.024
"To my loving husband,
on this day,

14:17.057 --> 14:19.192
you're not over the hill,

14:19.226 --> 14:20.560
you're on top of it."

14:21.895 --> 14:22.829
Really beautiful card.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.565
That's one hell of a dream
you had.

14:25.598 --> 14:27.167
I'm gonna
go see what I look like

14:27.200 --> 14:28.335
holding this
in a mirror.

14:31.771 --> 14:34.841
Well, I feel like you're upset
with me about Louis' gift.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.209
Of course I'm upset!

14:36.243 --> 14:37.677
Marvin put a lot of thought
into that ax,

14:37.710 --> 14:39.179
and you stole it!

14:39.212 --> 14:40.680
Well, I panicked.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.283
Louis' birthday is soon,
and I have nothing.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.418
First, you got in my head
about the tie,

14:45.452 --> 14:47.354
and then you gave me
that book that didn't work.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.556
So, in a way,
this is all your fault.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.524
You stole Marvin's ax.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.194
I st-- I --

14:54.227 --> 14:55.862
Jessica,
I cannot believe this.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.067
Louis: Now I know
you're probably thinking,

15:00.100 --> 15:01.468
"Where's our
matching outfits?"

15:01.501 --> 15:03.036
But don't worry,

15:03.070 --> 15:04.271
I've got Hector
swinging by the tailor

15:04.304 --> 15:06.106
after he picks up
a pallet of ribs.

15:06.139 --> 15:07.407
Now, eyes on me.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.116
* One, two,
cha-cha-cha *

15:16.149 --> 15:17.550
* One, two,
cha-cha-cha *

15:17.584 --> 15:18.451
See what
I'm doing here?

15:18.485 --> 15:19.819
* Cha-cha-cha

15:19.852 --> 15:21.388
* One, two,
cha-cha-cha *

15:21.421 --> 15:22.822
Eddie: Are you sure
about this?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.257
I mean, we'd hate
to interrupt the party

15:24.291 --> 15:26.093
that's in full swing
to do a dance.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.494
Louis: Keep the hips loose,
just like this.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.563
Arms up, and a smile.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.232
That's the most important
thing -- the smile.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.567
"Suck it up and go camping,"
I said, but no.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.902
No one listens to me.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.237
You're the one
who reminded him

15:37.270 --> 15:38.638
he's the Cha Cha King
of Taipei.

15:38.671 --> 15:40.407
He's the king
of this?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.941
What kind of kingdom
is this?

15:41.975 --> 15:45.178
Your arms are like --
like broken bird wings.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.813
Just like
they're broken.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.650
A cha-cha-cha!

15:57.957 --> 15:58.992
This is how it ends for me.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.093
I would've knocked,

16:00.127 --> 16:01.594
but I didn't want
to wake the baby.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.031
Oh, now you're worried
about others?

16:04.064 --> 16:06.099
I'm sorry I stole this.

16:06.133 --> 16:09.202
I'm just worried I don't know
Louis as well as I think I do.

16:09.236 --> 16:10.503
What are you
talking about?

16:10.537 --> 16:12.805
You saw how excited he got
with the ax.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.008
I never would have thought
to get him something like this.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.343
Well, of course,
you wouldn't.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.944
Louis and Marvin have
a different relationship

16:17.977 --> 16:19.012
than you two do.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.514
They're into chili,
"Ernest" movies,

16:21.548 --> 16:23.550
and turning tires
into swings.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.952
Do you really want to sit
around talking about axes?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.188
No, I don't.
Me, neither.

16:28.221 --> 16:30.357
You and I have
a different relationship.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.691
You think they want
to sit around

16:31.724 --> 16:33.560
discussing
Stephen King novels

16:33.593 --> 16:36.396
or spend an afternoon
prank-calling Deidre?

16:36.429 --> 16:40.167
"I'll wear
your face as my face."

16:40.200 --> 16:41.668
We do have fun.
Mm-hmm.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.002
And so do you and Louis.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.372
I mean, Jessica, you know him
better than anyone.

16:45.405 --> 16:47.507
I'm sure you'll find
the perfect gift.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.776
-And you're sure it's not --
-It's not a tie.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.314
5, 6, 7, 8.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.486
All right, now this part
right here is important.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.653
How many parts
are there?

17:00.687 --> 17:02.555
Well, there's
four basic ones,

17:02.589 --> 17:03.856
but we're not
stopping there.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.925
I didn't win the crown
by keeping things simple.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.395
Hey, holster
those bony wrists.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.497
Evan, make sure you don't work
a slow step in there.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.898
This isn't a mambo.

17:11.931 --> 17:13.666
I'm not
a visual learner.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.901
Eddie,
remember to breathe.

17:14.934 --> 17:16.269
You're looking
a little stiff.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.870
I don't have
the hips for this.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.574
It's okay, boys.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.543
Much like
the cha-cha itself,

17:23.576 --> 17:25.512
learning to dance is often
two steps forward

17:25.545 --> 17:26.613
and a rock-step back.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.548
Do we really have
to do this?
Yeah.

17:28.581 --> 17:30.383
Can we just be done?
-Trust me.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.884
I remember when
I was first learning.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.920
It gets a lot more fun
the more you do it!

17:33.953 --> 17:36.589
None of this is fun
for any of us.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.225
It's just dumb.
-But you're the ones

17:38.258 --> 17:39.892
who suggested
I throw this party.

17:39.926 --> 17:42.195
We're only here because you guys
were so excited for it.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.631
That's only because we didn't
want to go camping with you.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.367
Oh.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.036
Look, uh,
this was a bad idea.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.571
Sorry I wasted your time.

17:51.604 --> 17:53.606
-That's not what we --
-No, I get it.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.942
I'm gonna make this
easier on all of us.

17:55.975 --> 17:57.677
Let's just
cancel the party.

17:59.912 --> 18:03.516
Well, dance continues
to destroy our family.

18:05.418 --> 18:06.453
What?

18:09.422 --> 18:10.723
How's the party-planning
coming?

18:10.757 --> 18:12.225
I need it to be
a home run

18:12.259 --> 18:14.561
because I still don't have
a gift for your father.

18:14.594 --> 18:15.728
Is a "gift horse"
a real thing?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.497
Or is that just one of those
weird sayings?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.565
The party's off.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.766
It's off?! Why?!

18:19.799 --> 18:21.834
Because Evan
can't cha-cha.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.437
I'm sorry, Mom.
We ruined Dad's 40th.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.275
Okay, we haven't
ruined it yet.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.743
His birthday's tomorrow, and
we're not gonna let him down.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.845
We just need to think.
What does your father like?

18:32.879 --> 18:34.447
-His hair?
-Drying his hair?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.583
I got it.
"Legends of the Fall."

18:36.616 --> 18:37.750
It's what started
this whole mess!

18:37.784 --> 18:39.152
Let's watch it!

18:39.186 --> 18:41.254
Sure, there's no mother
character to root for,

18:41.288 --> 18:42.755
but maybe it will give us
some ideas.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.524
Might even
cheer us up!

18:44.557 --> 18:46.092
Whoa.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.760
That was
one heavy movie.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.796
Nearly everyone died.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.198
Why would anyone watch this?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.465
It's just a two-hour tragedy

18:52.499 --> 18:54.667
about a family wishing
they had more time together.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.306
Come on, Louis.
Almost there.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.141
Okay. Take off
your blindfold.

19:07.079 --> 19:08.848
You brought
the Big Sky wilderness

19:08.881 --> 19:09.982
to Orlando.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.720
This is the best
birthday gift ever.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.455
We realized that
the one thing you love

19:15.488 --> 19:16.789
more than anything
in the world

19:16.823 --> 19:18.225
is spending time
with your family.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.492
Emery: We also took
some inspiration

19:19.526 --> 19:21.228
from that depressing movie
you love.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.330
You watched "Legends"?

19:23.363 --> 19:25.565
For Anthony Hopkins
to go from Hannibal Lecter

19:25.598 --> 19:26.533
to Colonel Ludlow?

19:26.566 --> 19:27.700
The range.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.369
And we're sorry, Dad.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.637
We made your 40th birthday
all about us

19:30.670 --> 19:32.372
when it's supposed to be
about you.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.706
Oh, it's okay.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.342
Maybe I went
a bit overboard.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.644
When you said my next
milestone would be 50,

19:37.677 --> 19:39.646
I realized you boys
will be out of the house.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.314
You'll be gone.

19:41.348 --> 19:42.815
Dad,
no matter where we are,

19:42.849 --> 19:44.517
we'll always come back
to see you.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.222
Thanks, guys.
This is such a thoughtful gift.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.090
-Happy birthday!
-Hey, buddy.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.925
I invited them, too.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.894
Hey!

19:54.927 --> 19:56.329
Jessica got me
that same ax.

19:56.363 --> 19:59.098
Okay, about that.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.000
I stole Marvin's ax
and gave it to you.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.169
I was worried that
the tie I got you

20:03.202 --> 20:05.505
wouldn't be meaningful enough
for this birthday.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.408
Are you kidding?
I love my birthday ties.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.510
They're my favorite accessory
after my hair.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.613
Hey, uh, Marvin, fire pit's
looking a little light.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.014
What do you say
we split some timber?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.583
All right, let's do it,
old man.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.018
Maybe I ought to put on
my steel-toe shoes.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.687
Can't afford to lose
any more toes.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
-Come on, boys.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.693
Looks like the book
worked out after all.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.595
What are you
talking about?

20:28.628 --> 20:30.930
The campsite where you guys
are spending the night?

20:30.963 --> 20:33.065
Having us over
to sit by the fire?

20:33.099 --> 20:35.234
Louis' love language
is "Quality Time."

20:35.268 --> 20:37.203
It's in the book.
Oh!

20:37.236 --> 20:38.705
I didn't get that far.

20:38.738 --> 20:41.574
I told you, you should have
told me the ending.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.146
-Oh, oh!
-Whoa, no, no, no!

20:51.518 --> 20:52.785
Why do I have to be
up against the sidewall?

20:52.819 --> 20:53.586
It's damp.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.087
Ow!

20:55.121 --> 20:56.323
Emery was right.

20:56.356 --> 20:57.790
What's going on
with your wrists?

20:57.824 --> 20:58.891
They're growing.

20:58.925 --> 21:01.961
-Shh!
-Three...two...one...

21:01.994 --> 21:02.929
midnight.

21:02.962 --> 21:05.665
I did it.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.433
I'm 40.

21:06.466 --> 21:07.800
-Yay.
-Happy birthday.

21:07.834 --> 21:08.935
Jessica:
How do you feel?

21:08.968 --> 21:10.570
Like my best days
are ahead of me.

21:10.603 --> 21:11.904
You enjoying tent life?

21:11.938 --> 21:13.973
-It's miserable. I hate camping.
-So do I.

21:14.006 --> 21:15.975
-Same.
-There's no air flow.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.445
Yeah, I thought I'd feel
more like Brad Pitt.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.747
I think us Huangs
are indoor cats.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.582
Should we all
go inside?

21:22.615 --> 21:24.250
-Yes!
-Finally! Oh, my God.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.985
Yeah, bad idea.
