But it's not all on him, I

01:49.943 --> 01:52.512
So, I decided to get
back on the stage.

01:52.579 --> 01:53.913
Hi.

01:53.980 --> 01:56.149
Put on a showcase and let
people know that Teairra Marie

01:56.216 --> 01:57.383
is still here.

01:57.450 --> 01:59.586
So, I reached out to my homegirl
Miss Diddy and her sidekick

Sincere, two of the
biggest promotors in LA.

02:02.188 --> 02:03.122
Ladies.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.557
The Supper Club is the
perfect venue for me.

02:04.624 --> 02:07.894
And if anybody can get me in
there, it's him and it's her.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.564

That's all I want to really

What's the point of
coming to see you do anything?

All right, I'm going to
go Google Teairra Marie.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.146
All right, I heard it.

02:27.213 --> 02:28.882
Ain't had a hit
out in a long time.

02:28.948 --> 02:30.517
You know what I'm
saying, I'm going to be blunt.

02:30.583 --> 02:33.386
I just know that the position
that you're in in your career,

02:33.453 --> 02:34.654

going to be too happy about me

02:36.923 --> 02:38.691

but you know,

02:38.758 --> 02:40.093
{\an5}I got a little soft
spot for her, man.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.795
She got the
titties, she got the eyes.

02:42.862 --> 02:45.632
But it's been a long time since
Teairra Marie put out a record,

02:45.698 --> 02:47.734
you know, this is
Hollywood, this is a tough town.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.469
But hopefully
she'll show improved.

02:49.536 --> 02:50.803
I want to see her deliver.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.238
Supper Club, you know,
it's a little too big,

02:52.305 --> 02:53.473
it's a little too much.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.409

prime time records perform.

02:56.476 --> 02:58.111
Yeah, J Lo was here one night.

02:58.177 --> 03:00.980

Teairra Marie because

03:01.047 --> 03:03.516
Teairra Marie hadn't had
a hit out in a long time.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.618
Man, you know, we
all heard the story.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.421
Teairra Marie ran
through the RayJ.com party.

03:08.488 --> 03:09.889
Tore up a whole bunch of stuff.

03:09.956 --> 03:12.091

that trap, but at the same time

03:12.158 --> 03:13.893
I'm a business man.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.029
So, if Teairra Marie about to
make the comeback of the year,

03:16.095 --> 03:19.232
king of shows need to be
a part of that for sure.

03:19.299 --> 03:22.268
We need to dial back, do
something smaller, intimate,

03:22.335 --> 03:24.604
where you can really get up
close and personal with the

03:24.671 --> 03:26.739
people and sing to these [bleep]

03:26.806 --> 03:29.108
Teairra Marie can really sing.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.378
I think that's why I'm saying
that, so I don't need you

03:32.445 --> 03:33.413

08:10.423 --> 08:12.058
You know, it really wasn't
a good time in my life,

08:12.124 --> 08:14.627
so I kept it to myself.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.630
Here I am thinking we're crazy
in love and she's cheating on me

08:17.697 --> 08:19.332
with some dude from Miami.

08:19.398 --> 08:21.434
If she's creeping around with
this dude, and basically got a

08:21.500 --> 08:26.138
love shack for him to stay
at when he come to town.

08:26.205 --> 08:28.808
She was even dumb enough to put
the apartment in her name,

08:28.875 --> 08:31.277
and that's something that
she's still trying to unravel.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.445
I forgave her, I took her back.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.080
Hold on, let me just
stop you right there.

08:34.145 --> 08:36.448
She stepped out
and you forgave her.

08:36.515 --> 08:37.283
Yeah.

08:37.350 --> 08:38.150
Damn.

08:38.217 --> 08:39.418
That's how I know
I really love her.

08:39.485 --> 08:41.888
I couldn't do that, bro,
I'll just be honest with you.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.489
Nobody's perfect,
you know what I mean?

to be reckoned with.

08:45.791 --> 08:46.959
Oh, no doubt.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.362
So, I kind of almost looked at
it as karma the first time,

08:49.428 --> 08:50.630
you know.

08:50.696 --> 08:53.199

share of women, but I feel like

08:53.266 --> 08:56.235
it's time for me to settle
down for the sake of my son.

08:56.302 --> 08:58.037
The one thing that I can say
that's different about Amanda

08:58.104 --> 09:00.439
from any other girl that I've
dated is that when we first

09:00.506 --> 09:03.609
met she had no idea who B2K was.

09:03.676 --> 09:07.380
So, immediately I felt a
genuine love for who I was.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.081
I'm really trying to make
this work, you know,

bit more permanent.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.587
I'm at a point where I really
want to build and have a family.

09:14.654 --> 09:17.590
Why do you feel like she's the
person for you to do that with?

09:17.657 --> 09:19.625
It's the time spent, you know,
we've been in a relationship

09:19.692 --> 09:20.826
for over two years.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.928
Ups and downs.

09:21.994 --> 09:24.130
Do you really feel
like she loves you?

09:24.196 --> 09:26.332
Do you feel like she
even respects you?

09:26.399 --> 09:29.168
Do you feel like she
even knows what respect is?

09:29.235 --> 09:30.403
I don't know, man, I'm
going to communicate

09:30.469 --> 09:31.804
and see where it's at.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.873
At that point I'm going to be
able to read and if it's not.

09:34.807 --> 09:35.574

16:13.405 --> 16:16.775
And the crazy thing about it is
Yesi put her up to the task

16:16.842 --> 16:20.979
and neither one of them
tell me what was what.

16:21.046 --> 16:22.681
You jack me for my assistant.

16:22.748 --> 16:24.283
You got her working, she
ain't telling me nothing.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.284
Like, I'm stuck in the cold.

16:25.351 --> 16:26.018
I'm usually by myself.

16:26.085 --> 16:27.286
You mad?

16:27.353 --> 16:29.121
She didn't want to do this, I
had to convince her to do it.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.556
So, if you're going to
blame anybody, blame me.

16:30.622 --> 16:33.092
Yesi, yes, I do blame you.

16:33.158 --> 16:36.128
I blame you for conspiring
to steal my assistant.

16:36.195 --> 16:38.664

because first it was the launch

of turns into a boxing match.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.104

turned up at my video shoot.

with my ex, which I keep

16:46.972 --> 16:48.240
telling her not to do.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.508
And now this.

16:49.575 --> 16:51.443
Bottom line is if you don't like
your job, then maybe you need

let me interrupt,

talk to her one on one and see
what you have to say.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.213
Okay.

did you fly to Vegas?

21:57.049 --> 21:58.250
Oh, gosh, I don't even know.

21:58.316 --> 22:00.152

there twice and you only stayed

at his house once.

I don't -- I couldn't even
count, that's how many times.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.825
I flew back and forth,
plane and private jet.

22:06.892 --> 22:10.362
Then he drove here and he would
stay at the W and I would

22:10.429 --> 22:11.496
stay there with him.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.532
So, do you feel like you
were in love with him?

22:13.598 --> 22:14.766
No, I definitely wasn't in love
with him, but I felt like at

22:14.833 --> 22:18.103

person that I could love.

love yous, because you said

one month period.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.719

was because my hair

22:35.887 --> 22:38.323
I've been holding onto my
hopes with all I've got.

talking about pulling hair,

22:40.659 --> 22:43.528

22:46.665 --> 22:49.768
Mally in particular loves
to pull this long ass hair.

22:49.835 --> 22:52.370
And the only way Masika would
know that is if they really

22:52.437 --> 22:53.672
did sleep together.

22:53.739 --> 22:55.474
When I had asked him I was
like, "Did you [bleep] her?"

22:55.540 --> 22:56.742

22:56.808 --> 22:59.277

what is going on here?"

23:07.819 --> 23:09.821
I need to know what I'm
dealing with because

this and she said that.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.561
just knowing that there's
a picture in his bed

23:49.628 --> 23:50.829
would be enough.

him or believe me,

kind of bad for this girl if she

mistakes, but I'm not going to

Drew questioning me about it.

I don't know who made it,

32:40.925 --> 32:42.360

talking about moving in together

going into depth on the truth.

there's nothing to show you.

33:02.113 --> 33:04.182
You won't show me your caller.

Obviously that
means you're lying.

catching me in anything.

none of this happened.

39:58.963 --> 39:59.830
{\an8}No.

39:59.897 --> 40:00.664
{\an8}Is this how you want
to do this [bleep]?

40:00.731 --> 40:03.300
{\an8}You gotta go.

40:03.367 --> 40:05.669
{\an8}Brandy's little brother Ray J
was arrested in Beverly Hills

40:05.736 --> 40:06.904
{\an8}Friday night.

40:06.971 --> 40:09.006
{\an8}The singer was booked for
trespassing, vandalism,

40:09.073 --> 40:11.675
{\an8}resisting arrest and battery.

40:11.742 --> 40:14.478
{\an8}Listen, I need you to
admit to yourself that you

40:14.545 --> 40:16.747
{\an8}are losing control.

40:16.814 --> 40:17.882
{\an8}I don't have a problem.

40:17.948 --> 40:18.883
{\an8}So, you're in denial.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.384
{\an8}I don't drink every day.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.954
{\an8}I'm with Dre and we're thinking
about moving in together.

40:24.021 --> 40:26.457
{\an8}Have you told dad?

40:26.524 --> 40:28.492
{\an8}I'm not ready to tell him
because I'm not ready

40:28.559 --> 40:31.562
{\an8}to hear everything that I
don't want to hear.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.064
{\an8}My dad's coming.

40:34.131 --> 40:37.968
{\an8}How are you doing, Mr.
Riley, nice to meet you.

40:38.035 --> 40:41.105
{\an8}Today?

40:41.172 --> 40:43.607
{\an8}It's evaluation day.

40:43.674 --> 40:44.909
{\an8}Is this the Berg record?

40:44.975 --> 40:48.445
{\an8}Yes, this is the Berg
record, finally, right?

40:48.512 --> 40:50.347
{\an8}Well, the beat is sick.

40:50.414 --> 40:52.283
{\an8}Why would you write a song
as if you were my [bleep].

40:52.349 --> 40:54.652
{\an8}Friends don't write [bleep]
songs about each other and

40:54.718 --> 40:57.188
{\an8}four-page letters and
all this other [bleep].

40:57.254 --> 40:58.322
{\an8}So, you ain't [bleep] with that.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.623
{\an8}No, I'm not working with you.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.225
{\an8}Seriously?

41:01.292 --> 41:04.762
{\an5}♪♪
