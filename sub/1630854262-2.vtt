WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:03.829
Tonight on
"Bachelor In Paradise.."

00:03.873 --> 00:07.485
- 'Who's Salley?'
- "Salley ain't here!"

00:07.529 --> 00:09.705
Oh, my God!

00:09.748 --> 00:11.141
- 'Ah!'
- 'What is it?'

00:11.185 --> 00:13.970
- 'Salley's vibrator.'
- 'Turn it off!'

00:14.014 --> 00:15.363
What vibrator?

00:18.583 --> 00:21.891
I can already feel the love
in the air.

00:21.934 --> 00:25.025
<i>Guys are giving out roses
this week.</i>

00:25.068 --> 00:26.461
Sierra understands the beauty

00:26.504 --> 00:29.072
that can happen
when you do find love again.

00:29.116 --> 00:32.336
Justin and I, on a scale
of one to ten, eleven.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.990
He wouldn't jeopardize that.

00:35.948 --> 00:38.038
Hey, y'all.

00:38.081 --> 00:40.344
<i>This was literally my fear.</i>

00:40.388 --> 00:43.304
If I don't get a rose from
Justin, I'm not getting a rose.

00:43.347 --> 00:47.090
Oh, it's about to be fireworks
out here.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.483
Logan was my number one.

00:48.526 --> 00:51.399
Who else is gonna
break my heart?

00:51.442 --> 00:53.314
I don't like the looks of this.

00:53.357 --> 00:54.793
- Jill.
- I know what you're doing.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.839
It's scaring me. Go away.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.626
- Don't wanna do this anymore.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.281
I just wanna go home.

01:04.325 --> 01:08.764

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
There's a crab under my bed.

02:38.288 --> 02:40.595
- Where? Where? Where?
- Oh, my God.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.292
- No!
- Get away! Get away! Get away!

02:42.336 --> 02:44.599
All these crabs,
like, they're so...

02:44.642 --> 02:46.601
I thought
they were gonna be cute.

02:46.644 --> 02:49.169
'This is not good.
This is real bad.'

02:49.212 --> 02:50.996
Ah!

02:51.040 --> 02:53.651
Alright, crab, get out of here!

02:56.567 --> 02:57.786
Ha.. Ha!

02:57.829 --> 03:00.702
They're everywhere!
They're everywhere.

03:00.745 --> 03:04.749
- He's gone. He's gone.
- Gone?

03:04.793 --> 03:07.839
- He's, he was...
- He's gone into our stuff.

03:07.883 --> 03:09.972
I'm not about to get pinched
by a crab

03:10.015 --> 03:11.321
'cause I can't deal with that.

03:11.365 --> 03:14.324
I will have a meltdown. Ho.

03:19.808 --> 03:21.853
Yeah, you're starting
to get red already.

03:21.897 --> 03:24.900
- Like, the back of your arms.
- Hey, guys.

03:24.943 --> 03:29.034
I am so excited to look out
and see the beautiful ocean.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.862
And we're in Paradise.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.735
I can already feel
the love in the air.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.693
Mm. Ears, ears.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.653
Couples-wise, we've got
Brandon and Serene...

03:38.696 --> 03:40.785
You are very thorough
with sunscreen.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.178
I am.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.354
<i>...Andrew and Teddi.</i>

03:44.398 --> 03:47.227
<i>Hunter and Johnny
seem to hit it off.</i>

03:47.270 --> 03:49.533
<i>Justin and Genevieve.</i>

03:49.577 --> 03:52.406
<i>Shanae is kind of hanging out
with Logan</i>

03:52.449 --> 03:55.235
<i>but I kind of wish that was me.</i>

03:55.278 --> 03:58.890
<i>And then Lace is sitting
in a corner by herself.</i>

04:00.152 --> 04:02.372
<i>Boys are giving out roses
this week</i>

04:02.416 --> 04:05.288
and there's already
two more girls than guys

04:05.332 --> 04:06.811
so that means two of us
are already going home.

04:06.855 --> 04:10.467
- We have the roses.
- Shut up.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.034
You have the high ground, Anakin.

04:13.427 --> 04:14.602
We don't need anymore girls.

04:14.645 --> 04:16.560
Close the gates. Cut 'em off.

04:16.604 --> 04:19.520
We don't need anymore.
We're full. We're at capacity.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.959
- What's up?
- Sit beside me.

04:24.002 --> 04:26.570
Justin and I
have a very good connection.

04:26.614 --> 04:30.226
I feel as good as I can,
I think.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.925
Scale of one to ten, ten. Eleven.

04:33.969 --> 04:35.492
I'm not kidding you.

04:35.536 --> 04:37.059
<i>And he hasn't pulled
anyone else.</i>

04:37.102 --> 04:39.931
<i>So I think
he's giving me his rose.</i>

04:39.975 --> 04:42.325
And I think him and I
have a good connection going.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.719
And someone comes in
to take him, like

04:44.762 --> 04:47.330
he wouldn't jeopardize that.

04:51.943 --> 04:55.556
I'm Victoria Fuller.
I was on Peter Weber's season.

04:55.599 --> 04:58.559
And nobody is more surprised

04:58.602 --> 05:00.996
that I'm back here than me.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.215
But here I am.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.261
You are so comical.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.524
- Do that. Do that.
- Imagine.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.745
<i>I think
Justin is really, really cool.</i>

05:10.788 --> 05:14.662
<i>I feel, like, with him, there
could be, like, potential</i>

05:14.705 --> 05:17.099
<i>for something really fun.</i>

05:17.142 --> 05:18.796
Awareness level, zero.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.148
<i>I think, at this point
in my life I just know who I am</i>

05:23.192 --> 05:24.628
<i>and I know exactly what I want.</i>

05:24.672 --> 05:27.588
And hopefully, he can handle me.

05:28.850 --> 05:31.113
Ah, ah.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.681
- 'Hi!'
- Victoria, hi.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.335
- How are you?
- Welcome to Paradise.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.640
- How are you?
- I'm good.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.425
- You made it.
- So nice to meet you.

05:38.468 --> 05:40.383
- So great to meet you, too.
- Aw...

05:40.427 --> 05:42.472
- So on Peter's season...
- Yes.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.909
That was just
a walk in the park, wasn't it?

05:44.953 --> 05:49.261
Absolutely. Thank you for,
you know, noticing that.

05:49.305 --> 05:51.612
I hope this experience
is different.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.483
- 'Yeah? How so?'
- And.. Um...

05:53.527 --> 05:56.225
I hope that I find love,
for one.

05:56.268 --> 05:58.575
Yeah, I think you came to
the right place to find love.

05:58.619 --> 06:00.621
- I'm excited.
- Alright.

06:00.664 --> 06:03.363
Victoria, ready to leave
your mark in Paradise?

06:03.406 --> 06:04.625
- I am.
- Okay.

06:04.668 --> 06:05.974
You may have arrived late

06:06.017 --> 06:07.454
but you are not arriving

06:07.497 --> 06:09.194
without an advantage.

06:09.238 --> 06:11.283
Oh, the date card.

06:11.327 --> 06:13.068
- This is a date card.
- Okay.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.679
And I want you to use it to
make a connection with someone.

06:15.723 --> 06:17.464
- Give that to you.
- Thank you.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.291
- Victoria, so great meeting ya.
- Thank you so much.

06:19.335 --> 06:20.902
I'm so glad you're here.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.599
I really, really do hope
you find love.

06:22.643 --> 06:24.122
- I know. Me, too.
- Here in the sand.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.820
- Alright. Put me in, coach.
- Alright.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.387
- I'm ready.
- Your time is now. Off you go.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.998
Get in there!
Make some plays, Victoria!

06:30.041 --> 06:31.565
I think tomorrow's
the Rose Ceremony, yeah.

06:31.608 --> 06:36.221
And I imagine more girls
are gonna be coming today.

06:36.265 --> 06:39.834
And that would,
that would stir things up.

06:39.877 --> 06:43.185
- 'That'd change everything.'
- 'Yeah.'

06:43.228 --> 06:44.578
Hey, y'all!

06:44.621 --> 06:47.058
- 'Hi.'
- 'Oh, hello.'

06:47.102 --> 06:49.409
- 'Hi.'
- Hi.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.628
- 'Oh, hi.'
- Oh, that's great.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.674
- That's perfect.
- I'm Victoria.

06:53.717 --> 06:56.764
It's Victoria Fuller.
She's gorgeous.

06:56.807 --> 06:59.157
I think every woman
was intimidated

06:59.201 --> 07:00.507
watching Victoria walk in.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.117
- Victoria.
- Nice to meet you.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.553
<i>So, yeah, it sucks.</i>

07:03.597 --> 07:05.555
Oh, it's hot.

07:05.599 --> 07:06.904
- 'I'm Logan. Welcome.'
- 'Hey. Victoria.'

07:06.948 --> 07:08.732
- Nice to meet you.
- Welcome.

07:08.776 --> 07:10.995
Victoria's intimidating.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.085
And you don't know who is she
gonna pull for a date.

07:14.129 --> 07:16.566
Um, so, yeah.

07:16.610 --> 07:18.263
- What's up? What's your name?
- Hi. Victoria.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.569
You are gorgeous.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.179
Of course, this is gonna happen.

07:21.223 --> 07:23.921
I just started making
this decently-strong connection

07:23.965 --> 07:26.271
<i>with Johnny, and, of course,
she's stunning</i>

07:26.315 --> 07:27.621
<i>so it's just putting me</i>

07:27.664 --> 07:30.711
in a little bit
of a stressful position.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.714
But we'll see how it goes.

07:33.757 --> 07:35.411
I have a date card.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.021
- 'Hey!'
- Oh, whoa!

07:37.065 --> 07:38.109
Ooh!

07:39.415 --> 07:41.025
"Victoria, welcome to Paradise.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.984
Don't be afraid
to make a splash."

07:43.027 --> 07:45.682
- Oh!
- Whoo!

07:48.685 --> 07:52.472
Okay, so, Logan,
can I talk to you for a second?

07:52.515 --> 07:54.604
Oh, my God.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.780
- Yeah.
- Oh, no.

07:56.824 --> 07:58.782
People are talking about you.

07:58.826 --> 08:01.524
No. What are they saying?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.134
I'm getting nervous
just 'cause, like

08:03.178 --> 08:06.050
I think I'm a little bit
into him right now.

08:06.094 --> 08:08.357
I am nervous,
I don't have a connection

08:08.400 --> 08:09.837
<i>with anyone else but Logan.</i>

08:09.880 --> 08:11.839
So I just, like, don't know
who anyone is.

08:11.882 --> 08:14.319
So it's nice to just, like,
come in with, like

08:14.363 --> 08:16.887
a clean slate with everyone, and...

08:16.931 --> 08:19.499
I noticed you
right when I walked in, so...

08:19.542 --> 08:20.717
- Well, thank you. Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

08:20.761 --> 08:23.285
- We all noticed you.
- It's scary.

08:23.328 --> 08:26.723
Oh, I'm still nervous.
We're walking on eggshells.

08:26.767 --> 08:29.421
Johnny, do you wanna go talk
for a second?

08:29.465 --> 08:30.814
What's up?

08:30.858 --> 08:33.251
Of course, Johnny got pulled.

08:33.295 --> 08:37.734
So, yeah, definitely a little,
little freaked out right now.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.083
What's your name again?
Caroline?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.868
Caroline? I'm dead.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.522
- I'm gonna be up-front--
- Do I look like a Caroline?

08:42.565 --> 08:45.002
- You kinda, actually, yeah.
- Cool. I kinda like that name.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.830
- Let's switch it.
- Caroline, yeah, it's dope.

08:46.874 --> 08:49.572
- Caroline's hot.
- Victoria-Victoria's not hot?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.574
- Victoria's hot, too.
- Okay.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.750
I'm stressed.
I'm very stressed right now.

08:53.794 --> 08:55.970
Don't be stressed. Why are you
getting stressed out?

08:56.013 --> 08:58.581
- I don't know.
- But i-it's gonna be fine.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.018
It's gonna be fine.
Don't even worry about it.

09:01.062 --> 09:02.846
- But, uh...
- But, yeah...

09:02.890 --> 09:04.631
I've had my best conversations
with him, so...

09:04.674 --> 09:07.024
- Where are you from, though?
- Virginia.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.026
Oh, definitely, like,
you're a Southern girl.

09:09.070 --> 09:11.333
- A little bit.
- You are perfect.

09:11.376 --> 09:14.945
Well, thank you.
Let's get married.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.860
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye. Sorry.

09:16.904 --> 09:20.734
I am spiraling, I am
freaking out, just wondering

09:20.777 --> 09:23.867
<i>what they could possibly be
talking about, how it's going</i>

09:23.911 --> 09:28.350
if he's going to go
on this date with her.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.746
Justin, do you wanna go talk
real quick?

09:32.789 --> 09:34.617
Uh, yeah, sure.

09:37.925 --> 09:40.231
- Hi! How are you?
- 'What's up? How are you?'

09:40.275 --> 09:42.886
Oh, it's about to be fireworks
out here, dude.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.671
- Yup.
- Wow.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.804
Genevieve and Justin
have been, you know

09:47.848 --> 09:50.894
side by side and developing
a strong relationship.

09:50.938 --> 09:53.418
And this is gonna be
their first test.

09:53.462 --> 09:56.073
It's gonna be
a great [bleep] day.

09:56.117 --> 09:59.903
Where the [bleep] can I hide?
Where can I hide?

09:59.947 --> 10:00.991
- 'Hi.'
- How are you?

10:01.035 --> 10:03.428
I'm Victoria. Nice to meet you.

10:03.472 --> 10:06.562
I feel like I've heard
about you just, like, through

10:06.606 --> 10:08.912
like, mutual friends and stuff, yeah.

10:08.956 --> 10:11.045
It would suck if Victoria
asked Justin, just because

10:11.088 --> 10:15.092
he's the only one that I've,
like, felt a connection with.

10:15.136 --> 10:19.096
It's my birthday tomorrow,
and I could be going home.

10:19.140 --> 10:20.968
I'm gonna go home
on my birthday.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.970
Tomorrow.. I'm gonna be
sent home on my birthday.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.449
...going home on your birthday.

10:24.493 --> 10:25.973
Genevieve's very on edge.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.149
That's what position I'm in,
like, 'cause if

10:28.192 --> 10:30.194
I don't get a rose from Justin,
I'm not getting a rose.

10:30.238 --> 10:31.761
And she's already beginning
to spiral.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.676
She's, like, in her head
about it and she's, like

10:33.720 --> 10:36.723
manifesting this to happen.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.986
- 'Where do you live?'
- In, uh, Nashville.

10:39.029 --> 10:41.553
- Been down Broadway? Ha-ha...
- Ah.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.990
- Yikes.
- I know.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.687
- Are you a Broadway girl?
- 'Absolutely not.'

10:44.731 --> 10:46.341
- We gotta stay away.
- Absolutely not.

10:46.384 --> 10:49.126
- Broadway girls, no.
- Uh-uh, uh-uh.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.129
<i>If Victoria takes Justin
on her date</i>

10:52.173 --> 10:54.305
Genevieve is...

10:55.045 --> 10:56.699
<i>...gonna lose it.</i>

11:03.532 --> 11:07.449
Okay, so, Justin, will you go
on this date with me?

11:10.800 --> 11:13.673
- Uh, yeah.
- 'Awesome.'

11:13.716 --> 11:14.804
- Let's go.
- Hey!

11:17.372 --> 11:18.765
I'm gonna lose Justin.

11:22.551 --> 11:25.641
- Let's go. I'm excited.
- Me, too.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.123
- 'It says, "Make a splash."'
- "Make a splash."

11:29.166 --> 11:31.342
- That could be anything.
- So I feel like it's water.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.652
I feel like
this is gonna be so much fun.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.716
I'm more interested in Justin
in one day

11:56.759 --> 12:00.589
than I was with Clayton
in a month, honestly.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.025
I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.245
- Where--
- Okay, I don't know.

12:11.078 --> 12:14.342
<i>If Justin goes on the date
with Victoria, I will be</i>

12:14.385 --> 12:18.259
I will be upset. I will not, I...
Yeah, I'll be upset.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.570
- Hello.
- Hey.

12:27.964 --> 12:28.965
Sorry.

12:36.059 --> 12:38.061
We can just, like,
sit right here.

12:40.063 --> 12:43.763
Um, yeah, obviously, I just
told you, like, last night

12:43.806 --> 12:45.765
that I'm always
gonna have a conversation.

12:45.808 --> 12:48.506
And, like, I think
everyone deserves that.

12:48.550 --> 12:50.813
Um, I truthfully, like

12:50.857 --> 12:54.121
would want you to do
the same thing

12:54.164 --> 12:56.688
because either way, like

12:56.732 --> 12:58.473
obviously, like,
I-I like our connection

12:58.516 --> 13:00.301
and I would want it
to be the case where, like

13:00.344 --> 13:03.304
if we've explored other things
and come back to each other

13:03.347 --> 13:06.220
then it's because we know
that the other options

13:06.263 --> 13:08.004
weren't as strong.

13:08.048 --> 13:10.224
And I know it, like,
like, I'd be bummed

13:10.267 --> 13:11.747
if somebody took you on a date,
you know

13:11.791 --> 13:14.315
so I'm not expecting you
to, like, be thrilled.

13:15.707 --> 13:17.884
- It's fine.
- Alright.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.539
<i>Justin and Victoria
going on a date sucks.</i>

13:21.583 --> 13:24.194
But, like, when Justin asks me,
I don't wanna say I'm upset

13:24.238 --> 13:27.589
because if I were to say
I was, like, upset and bummed

13:27.632 --> 13:30.244
<i>where would that get me
if I said I'm really bummed</i>

13:30.287 --> 13:31.419
<i>and disappointed?</i>

13:31.462 --> 13:33.638
Where would that get me?

13:38.165 --> 13:40.863
Do you have, like, a backup
besides Justin?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.300
Genevieve put herself
in a little predicament

13:43.344 --> 13:47.914
because she focused on him
and him only.

13:47.957 --> 13:51.439
So it's Justin or bust.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.444
- 'Oh! Hoochie-daddy!'
- Hello!

13:56.487 --> 13:58.925
- Hi!
- Look at you!

13:58.968 --> 14:01.884
- Hey!
- I like the outfit, though.

14:01.928 --> 14:04.017
- 'Don Juan.'
- 'Looking so good.'

14:04.060 --> 14:05.453
- 'Yeah, you look good.'
- Thanks, guys.

14:05.496 --> 14:06.889
You're so welcome.

14:06.933 --> 14:09.326
We are all watching Genevieve

14:09.370 --> 14:12.547
and, like,
I can just feel the tension.

14:12.590 --> 14:14.636
- 'Nervous?'
- Am I nervous? I guess.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.725
I don't know. It should be fun.

14:16.768 --> 14:18.770
You don't even know
what to say to comfort her

14:18.814 --> 14:20.772
because nothing really can.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.386
Justin, are you ready?

14:25.429 --> 14:26.430
- Yeah.
- Oh, hey.

14:26.474 --> 14:27.997
Let's go.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.782
You look great.
I like that shirt.

14:30.826 --> 14:33.611
- 'You two have fun now.'
- Bye!

14:33.655 --> 14:37.311
Waking up, I was happy.
Seeing Justin, I was happy.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.530
<i>Seeing Victoria walk in,
not happy.</i>

14:39.574 --> 14:41.663
<i>Finding out
Justin is going on the date</i>

14:41.706 --> 14:43.883
<i>I hope it goes terribly.</i>

14:45.014 --> 14:46.146
So...

14:48.148 --> 14:49.497
'Let's ride!'

14:52.456 --> 14:54.763
Hit the gas. Hit the gas!
Hit the gas!

14:54.806 --> 14:57.331
- Ah!
- Giddyap! Oh, [bleep]!

15:00.725 --> 15:02.510
Oh!

15:02.553 --> 15:04.773
- Oh! Oh, my...
- Ha-ha-ha...

15:04.816 --> 15:06.906
I think we made a splash!

15:06.949 --> 15:08.864
Are you okay?

15:08.908 --> 15:11.084
- Yeah, I'm good.
- I'm sorry.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.782
I love this date. So much fun.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.132
Justin was literally
cracking me up the entire time

15:16.176 --> 15:17.786
<i>which I already knew
he was going to.</i>

15:17.829 --> 15:20.136
And I'm just excited
to get to know him more.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.530
- My eyes, I can't see.
- Can you see?

15:22.573 --> 15:25.011
- Oh!
- You're driving blind?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.752
I think, like, if he comes back

15:27.796 --> 15:29.667
has a better connection,
I'm going home tomorrow

15:29.711 --> 15:31.800
'because I'm not chasing roses,
I'm not.'

15:31.843 --> 15:34.368
He's not gonna come back and
say, "I'm, oh, done with you."

15:34.411 --> 15:36.892
- 'It's either gonna--'
- Yes, it, oh, it could defin...

15:36.936 --> 15:39.155
I mean, it's either gonna be,
"I like you or her."

15:39.199 --> 15:41.679
- It's so early.
- I think if he's conflicted...

15:41.723 --> 15:42.898
'I think you should still try.'

15:42.942 --> 15:44.334
Absolutely not!

15:44.378 --> 15:45.901
I think it's gonna be, "It's
you," or "I'm conflicted

15:45.945 --> 15:47.207
and wanna date both of you."
And if it's both--

15:47.250 --> 15:50.123
I would never. If he was
conflicted, I would never.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.995
I'm-I'm packing, I'm, like,
packing and going myself.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.345
- No, you're not. You're not l--
- Watch me.

15:55.389 --> 15:58.044
If Justin forms
a connection today

15:58.087 --> 16:00.829
that would be horrible

16:00.872 --> 16:03.310
terrible.

16:03.353 --> 16:05.225
<i>I don't even wanna know
what they're doing right now.</i>

16:05.268 --> 16:08.184
- That was a lot of fun.
- Hey. Let's go.

16:08.837 --> 16:10.012
Ugh.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.758
- Thank you again for coming.
- No, thank you for asking me.

16:16.801 --> 16:18.020
Within our first, like,
five minutes

16:18.064 --> 16:20.109
I feel like
we understood each other.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.590
And so I was just, like,
excited to go on the date

16:22.633 --> 16:23.983
um, and I'm glad I did.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.941
I know. I'm really glad you did.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.508
Like, your humor
is just like me.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.032
You don't take yourself
seriously, like, you're just fun

16:30.076 --> 16:32.774
and, y-yeah, I was like,
"This is an easy pick."

16:32.817 --> 16:36.212
- Yeah.
- Like, "He's great."

16:36.256 --> 16:37.953
I think it is special
when you meet somebody

16:37.997 --> 16:40.173
that it's just, like,
super easy off the jump.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.349
You know what I mean? Like,
you can't go looking for that.

16:42.392 --> 16:44.829
It's just like, it takes, like,
a special type of person

16:44.873 --> 16:46.701
for me to, like,
immediately connect.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.442
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, to gravitate toward.

16:48.485 --> 16:51.314
Yeah, you know when you do, you,
like, and I know when I don't.

16:51.358 --> 16:53.664
I'm not gonna settle for
something that doesn't make me

16:53.708 --> 16:56.711
happy and that's not, like,
that instant connection feeling.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.408
Yeah.

16:58.452 --> 17:01.759
I definitely felt, you know,
a vibe between me and Victoria.

17:01.803 --> 17:03.761
I think we get
each other's humor.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.894
The conversation
is easy-flowing.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.244
<i>Feels like we've known
each other for a lot longer</i>

17:08.288 --> 17:10.116
<i>than just today, so I think</i>

17:10.159 --> 17:12.857
there could be a promising
future with me and Victoria.

17:15.860 --> 17:17.645
'It's like the storms
you gotta weather.'

17:17.688 --> 17:19.821
When you weather the storms,
you're gonna be alright.

17:19.864 --> 17:23.651
Can you, like, talk to Justin
after and tell me what you can

17:23.694 --> 17:25.261
without breaking his trust--

17:25.305 --> 17:26.915
Dude, you guys
are gonna have a talk, right

17:26.958 --> 17:29.135
and he's-he's gonna be
so open with you.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.094
He's not, he's not that kind
of guy where he hides stuff.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.661
Yeah. You said
you're friends with her. Like...

17:33.704 --> 17:37.056
Who do you see him honestly
getting along better with?

17:37.099 --> 17:38.840
I don't know, I feel like
there's, like, an added pressure

17:38.883 --> 17:40.276
just-just to someone's name.

17:40.320 --> 17:43.149
So just, like,
her being Victoria, like

17:43.192 --> 17:44.976
people are already, like,
shaking, like

17:45.020 --> 17:46.935
"Oh, my God, Victoria is here."

17:56.031 --> 17:58.338
Great girl, like,
a really nice person.

17:58.381 --> 18:01.123
But, like, she still has to do
the exact same things

18:01.167 --> 18:03.604
as every other girl has to,
so the thing is, like

18:03.647 --> 18:07.042
Justin's just a really easy guy
to get along with.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.131
- Heh. Might as well.
- Let's do it.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.046
Why not roll the dice?

18:18.575 --> 18:21.622
No, I think you'll be fine.
I-I truly think you'll be fine.

18:21.665 --> 18:23.537
You don't have nothing
really to worry about.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.889
He has the rose.
He's on the date.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.152
He knows it's up to him.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.936
What's meant for you,
no one can take away.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.287
<i>So, like, if he is meant for me</i>

18:34.330 --> 18:35.723
<i>she won't be able
to take him away.</i>

18:35.766 --> 18:38.465
<i>And if he comes back
and he's confused</i>

18:38.508 --> 18:39.988
<i>that doesn't make sense to me</i>

18:40.031 --> 18:42.904
'cause if he's confused,
then I don't want him.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.124
This might be the last time
y'all see us.

18:45.167 --> 18:48.039
I don't know.
My emotions are, like, mm...

18:49.954 --> 18:52.043
Now they're, like, pssh,
down there.

18:59.921 --> 19:02.489
'How are you feeling
about everything?'

19:02.532 --> 19:04.230
Good.
I'm trying to be in the moment.

19:04.273 --> 19:07.146
I'm trying to get to know
people, like, for who they are.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.583
But again, you know who you
click with. Well, I know that.

19:09.626 --> 19:13.195
I don't know, like, I feel like
I'm putting myself out there...

19:13.239 --> 19:15.241
- You are.
- For these guys so much.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.851
Like, you are being the man
in the relationship.

19:16.894 --> 19:20.115
Yeah, and I'm not getting
anything back from them.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.683
It's just, like,
weak [bleep] energy.

19:22.726 --> 19:24.337
Mm-hmm. Oh!

19:24.380 --> 19:27.340
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh,
my God! What? What? What? What?

19:27.383 --> 19:30.778
- Crab.
- Oh, my God, he's kinda cute.

19:30.821 --> 19:34.521
My Paradise experience
started off very negatively

19:34.564 --> 19:39.308
with the Jill and Romeo
situation yesterday

19:39.352 --> 19:40.614
<i>but I don't need
anymore of that.</i>

19:40.657 --> 19:44.487
I just wanna have my fun
time right now.

19:44.531 --> 19:46.010
Isn't it crazy, though,
how much we've talked

19:46.054 --> 19:47.534
to all these people
more than Clayton?

19:47.577 --> 19:50.101
'Yeah, I know. Crazy.'

19:50.145 --> 19:52.800
'Yeah.
Are you vibing with anyone yet?'

19:52.843 --> 19:55.629
I've narrowed it down
to two guys that I'm into

19:55.672 --> 19:58.284
but I don't feel like,
I almost feel like

19:58.327 --> 20:00.416
that's too much. Like,
do you think I'm, like-like...

20:00.460 --> 20:03.071
- No. I mean, that's the thing.
- Extending myself too much?

20:03.114 --> 20:04.681
- You want a connection.
- Yeah.

20:04.725 --> 20:08.381
But don't be forceful.
You know what I'm saying?

20:08.424 --> 20:10.339
Like, just go in
as a casual conversation and--

20:10.383 --> 20:11.906
You think I've been, like,
sort of forceful?

20:11.949 --> 20:14.082
I don't know. I don't know
what your conversations are.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.302
'But, like, we have,
this is day two.'

20:16.345 --> 20:20.131
And I think some people
are all in right now.

20:20.175 --> 20:23.047
Yeah, like Serene
and, um, Brandon.

20:23.091 --> 20:26.964
So the couples right now
are Serene and Brandon

20:27.008 --> 20:28.488
<i>Teddi and Andrew.</i>

20:28.531 --> 20:31.317
<i>And I had a great connection</i>

20:31.360 --> 20:33.580
with Casey and Jacob yesterday.

20:33.623 --> 20:36.844
But I just have a-a really good
feeling about Casey.

20:36.887 --> 20:39.542
I have made it known to him
that I like him

20:39.586 --> 20:43.372
and I find him attractive,
I like how his mind works.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.853
And I rubbed his nipples.

20:45.896 --> 20:49.160
- Kira is a [bleep] madwoman.
- She really is, dude.

20:49.204 --> 20:50.727
Dude, last night she grabbed me

20:50.771 --> 20:53.643
and immediately started, like,
playing with my nipples.

20:53.687 --> 20:55.471
I'm like,
"Alright, like, calm down."

20:55.515 --> 20:58.387
And then told me
her love language was [bleep].

20:58.431 --> 21:00.520
- Really?
- Swear to God.

21:00.563 --> 21:03.871
She's like, "I love [bleep].
Let's go crazy."

21:03.914 --> 21:06.221
I'm like, "Yeah, no."

21:06.265 --> 21:09.180
- Oh, my God!
- This girl's really got a kink.

21:09.224 --> 21:11.531
- Yeah. Um, which, again...
- No, it's no...

21:11.574 --> 21:13.707
- No, there's no judgment.
- There's no judgment.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.752
But I don't know you.

21:15.796 --> 21:19.060
Unfortunately,
my love language is tacos.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.062
So I think
Kira is too much for me.

21:21.105 --> 21:25.284
I like crazy, but I'm a 100%
ready to get engaged.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.111
I need a good girl.

21:29.288 --> 21:30.985
- 'Squat time. Let's get it.'
- 'Okay.'

21:32.247 --> 21:35.163
Three, two, win.

21:35.206 --> 21:38.079
Look. Oh, my gosh,
they're working out.

21:38.122 --> 21:40.429
The guys have the power
and the roses.

21:40.473 --> 21:42.213
<i>But this is a competition</i>

21:42.257 --> 21:44.651
<i>and I'm not gonna go in
and sit and relax.</i>

21:44.694 --> 21:46.392
Uh, you know,
nobody gets to the top

21:46.435 --> 21:49.177
without busting
a couple of heads.

21:49.220 --> 21:51.310
Five, six...

21:51.353 --> 21:53.573
Not like I'm gonna bust
any heads, but...

21:53.616 --> 21:55.618
Let's do one more set
of jump squats

21:55.662 --> 21:57.098
'cause that's what's gonna
build the booty.

21:57.141 --> 21:58.186
Personally, I don't think anybody

21:58.229 --> 22:00.623
thinks I'm a model, I just...

22:00.667 --> 22:03.974
If they do, great.
I've heard it before.

22:04.018 --> 22:05.585
Ooh! Push-ups.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.979
<i>I think, at this point,
I'm my perfect self</i>

22:09.023 --> 22:11.547
but I could definitely have
even more chiseled abs.

22:11.591 --> 22:15.682
I can't get this little bit
of fat off of my lower abs.

22:15.725 --> 22:19.903
And if I could also get
even bigger legs

22:19.947 --> 22:21.949
that would be awesome.

22:21.992 --> 22:25.387
But that's-that's it. Maybe,
maybe even bigger shoulders.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.215
But, like, who really cares?

22:29.522 --> 22:31.306
- 'I'm coming in hot.'
- Come on in.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.221
I'm coming
sitting next to you, Zaddy.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.831
Get up in here.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.703
- How was the workout?
- Ah, it was good.

22:36.746 --> 22:40.315
I feel, like, really dehydrated,
though. I'm not gonna lie.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.404
Michael's very handsome.

22:42.448 --> 22:47.148
He's a whole-ass zaddy.
He's like a "Zam Zaddy."

22:47.191 --> 22:51.282
It's a Z-A-M Zam Zaddy.

22:51.326 --> 22:55.678
But, no, he is very handsome.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.768
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
talk to you down here.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.814
<i>But then he's also, like,
you know, a dad, you know</i>

23:00.857 --> 23:05.993
so he is grounded and he has,
like, this great glowing

23:06.036 --> 23:09.170
like, vibrant energy that comes,
like, exudes off of him.

23:09.213 --> 23:10.998
'Let's see the ocean
if we can.'

23:11.041 --> 23:13.914
<i>We definitely have
a really good connection.</i>

23:13.957 --> 23:15.263
<i>But I wanna be realistic.</i>

23:15.306 --> 23:16.656
We can go hide over here.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.875
<i>He's got the child,
so we still have</i>

23:18.919 --> 23:22.009
some big questions
and big conversations.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.967
You know, so who knows?

23:24.011 --> 23:26.579
This whole thing
is so unfamiliar to me.

23:26.622 --> 23:30.713
Like, I don't date multiple
people, I don't. This is weird.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.673
- And-- Yeah, and so...
- 'It's hard.'

23:33.716 --> 23:37.546
You know, I'm just, I'm just
trying to, like, do this right.

23:37.590 --> 23:40.462
Like, tonight I wanna hang out
with you, but I don't know if

23:40.506 --> 23:43.552
I don't know if you're vibing
with anybody.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.642
I'm not really vibing

23:46.686 --> 23:48.339
with anybody like that, no.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.385
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, like, I like you. Um...

23:50.429 --> 23:53.562
I like you, too.
I feel like we get each other.

23:53.606 --> 23:57.392
You know, I feel that.
But I take things slow.

23:57.436 --> 24:00.656
- Just, there's a lot at stake.
- 'Same.'

24:00.700 --> 24:04.965
And I don't know how to, like,
manage these things.

24:05.008 --> 24:06.793
I'm bad at it.
Like, I'm really bad--

24:06.836 --> 24:09.317
- I am, too. I'm not...
- Like, I'm really bad at it.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.493
I mean, I don't think
you're bad at it.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.191
I think, I mean, you're doing,
you're doing well right now.

24:14.235 --> 24:17.238
It's odd because, you know

24:17.281 --> 24:19.196
I'm, like, naturally guarded now

24:19.240 --> 24:21.547
whereas before,
I totally wasn't.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.983
What do you mean, like,
after your, you know...

24:23.026 --> 24:24.767
- After-after Laura passed.
- 'Yeah.'

24:24.811 --> 24:28.554
Like, just there, it's almost
like a grieving thing.

24:28.597 --> 24:30.469
Like, I dated a little bit

24:30.512 --> 24:32.340
'you know,
after she-she passed away.'

24:32.383 --> 24:35.778
And-and it's-it's like I

24:35.822 --> 24:38.520
I get excited in the beginning.

24:38.564 --> 24:41.610
And then when the feelings
start to shift

24:41.654 --> 24:45.571
it starts to be, like, scary
when it gets more intense.

24:45.614 --> 24:50.271
Since my wife passed away,
dating is really challenging.

24:50.314 --> 24:53.840
I feel like when things get

24:53.883 --> 24:56.538
too real

24:56.582 --> 24:57.974
you know, I get scared

24:58.018 --> 25:00.107
but I also truly believe

25:00.150 --> 25:04.938
I haven't found the person
I'm supposed to be with.

25:04.981 --> 25:08.507
<i>But hopefully,
I find that person here.</i>

25:08.550 --> 25:13.468
I wanna, you know,
get back to building

25:13.512 --> 25:18.604
and, and, you know, stability
and all that.

25:19.692 --> 25:23.478
One thing I really am scared of

25:23.522 --> 25:27.569
is that I'm not ready,
and I don't wanna...

25:27.613 --> 25:29.963
- 'Don't force, yeah.'
- Use somebody to get ready.

25:30.006 --> 25:32.226
'Yeah, oh, you don't wanna
force it either.'

25:32.269 --> 25:33.836
'I think
it's just a hard spot.'

25:33.880 --> 25:36.099
I can't fully ever put myself,
like, in your shoes, right

25:36.143 --> 25:37.971
but, like, if I were to think
about, like, if I was married

25:38.014 --> 25:40.147
and I were to, like,
lose my husband, I mean

25:40.190 --> 25:42.628
'there are so many little things
that would, like, get to me.'

25:42.671 --> 25:44.717
'Like, waking up in the bed
next to me.'

25:44.760 --> 25:47.894
You know, like, that would be
the hard part for me.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.504
- You-you're-you're spot-on.
- Yeah.

25:49.548 --> 25:52.159
It's-it's-it's all of that.

25:52.202 --> 25:53.856
- Um...
- It's scary. It is.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.597
Yeah, like,
when she passed away

25:55.641 --> 25:59.035
I actually started, like,
sleeping across my bed.

25:59.079 --> 26:01.821
Like, I switched because it was,
like, her side, my side.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.214
And then I just started sleeping
this way.

26:04.258 --> 26:05.825
Oh, my God,
you're gonna make me cry.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.914
Yeah. And-and, like, I-I.. Yeah.

26:07.957 --> 26:10.873
- Oh, my God. That's so sad.
- Yeah.

26:10.917 --> 26:13.572
It's that kind of weird stuff,
you know? And--

26:13.615 --> 26:16.705
Yeah, it's those little things.
Those are, like, deep.

26:16.749 --> 26:19.186
I keep, like, thinking about it.
I'm like, "I can't imagine.."

26:19.229 --> 26:21.536
- Yeah. Oh...
- Like, feeling those things.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.669
Come here. You're sweet.

26:26.715 --> 26:29.413
Um, you know, your eyes

26:29.457 --> 26:30.937
are watering.
I don't know why you're crying.

26:30.980 --> 26:33.635
- You have me tearing up, too.
- I'm sorry.

26:33.679 --> 26:36.595
But, um, you know, going back to

26:36.638 --> 26:40.555
like, you know,
dating new people

26:40.599 --> 26:43.166
and, like, incorporating them
into your life, like

26:43.210 --> 26:46.866
I don't know, I feel like
whoever you do end up choosing

26:46.909 --> 26:50.173
right, like,
whoever it is, right

26:50.217 --> 26:54.090
that it's never, like,
replacing, you know, her.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.876
Yeah, I love, like,
the idea of, like

26:56.919 --> 27:01.358
reflecting on the past
so that I don't forget it.

27:01.402 --> 27:05.667
And I know, like, I want love.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.713
Like, well,
everybody wants the same thing.

27:07.756 --> 27:11.891
We all want happiness,
and, I don't know...

27:11.934 --> 27:14.545
Thank you for, like,
listening to this.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.243
- Absolutely.
- Like, you're so sweet.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.940
Um, I love listening.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.909
Sierra is amazing.

27:31.127 --> 27:33.477
She totally understands

27:33.521 --> 27:37.264
<i>that old type of love that,
you know, is forever</i>

27:37.307 --> 27:41.094
<i>that exists still
between me and Laura</i>

27:41.137 --> 27:44.706
but also understands the beauty
that can happen

27:44.750 --> 27:46.229
when you do find love again.

27:48.405 --> 27:50.190
You got some
soft-ass lips, girl.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.148
I know.

27:57.414 --> 27:59.765
<i>I had no idea Sierra and I</i>

27:59.808 --> 28:02.942
<i>would have
this kind of connection.</i>

28:02.985 --> 28:04.291
<i>I don't know what'll happen</i>

28:04.334 --> 28:06.554
<i>but something
really good there</i>

28:06.597 --> 28:08.512
<i>like, really, really good.</i>

28:08.556 --> 28:11.646
I can't not

28:11.690 --> 28:12.995
feel that one.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.441
- Get 'em, Johnny.
- Ah!

28:27.401 --> 28:30.012
- 'What?'
- What is that?

28:30.056 --> 28:31.797
- 'Ah! This creature.'
- 'Whoa!'

28:31.840 --> 28:34.495
- 'Oh, it's a dragonfly.'
- This one is not a dragonfly.

28:34.538 --> 28:36.627
- 'It's a wasp?'
- Is it a bug?

28:36.671 --> 28:39.413
What is that?

28:39.456 --> 28:40.719
- Look at this thing right here.
- Oh!

28:40.762 --> 28:44.505
- Oh, my God.
- Damn. What the...

28:48.117 --> 28:50.119
- 'Joking.'
- 'I would have lost my..'

28:51.425 --> 28:53.209
- 'What's up?'
- 'Whoo!'

28:55.385 --> 28:57.561
- 'This is nice.'
- Oh.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.738
Super nice. Come on over.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.610
Come on over.

29:02.653 --> 29:06.788
- 'What do people do in Ohio?'
- Camping Thursday to Sunday.

29:06.832 --> 29:10.270
- Thank you. That's always fun.
- Mm-hmm.

29:10.313 --> 29:13.534
I feel like
I have a connection with Logan.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.450
And so to, so to see him
with somebody else

29:16.493 --> 29:19.235
kind of sucks.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.977
And even though you're like,
"Oh, like

29:22.021 --> 29:23.457
<i>I do want you
to get to know people"</i>

29:23.500 --> 29:25.285
but, like,
do you actually, though?

29:25.328 --> 29:28.157
Like, I would love for a guy
to just fully, like, pursue me.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.377
But at the end of the day,
like, that's not the situation

29:30.420 --> 29:33.554
we're in, so it just sucks.

29:33.597 --> 29:35.861
'Logan's been hanging
with Shanae, like, all morning.'

29:35.904 --> 29:38.080
- I've seen that.
- And I'm, like...

29:38.124 --> 29:39.821
But you know
how she's very aggressive.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.824
So, like, it could be
a lot of her, too.

29:42.868 --> 29:45.392
You don't think
you should just, like

29:45.435 --> 29:47.611
shut it out, whatever-whatever?
I don't know.

29:47.655 --> 29:49.352
But that makes me question, like

29:49.396 --> 29:52.747
do they have, like, the same
connection that I have?

29:52.791 --> 29:54.270
- Yeah.
- And, like...

29:54.314 --> 29:56.011
Do I really want to compete

29:56.055 --> 30:00.059
and, like, add the stress
into, like, my situation?

30:00.102 --> 30:03.453
But I think we also, because the
guys have the roses this week

30:03.497 --> 30:06.543
we have to, unfortunately

30:06.587 --> 30:08.154
'be the ones
who put in the effort.'

30:08.197 --> 30:10.199
- Yeah, I know.
- And we're not used to that.

30:10.243 --> 30:13.550
I know. I'm, oh,
I'm definitely not used to that.

30:13.594 --> 30:15.770
Oh, there's something
on my face.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.120
But, yeah,
I'm gonna pull Logan.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.601
I'm just gonna tell him, like,
"Hey, just so you know

30:20.644 --> 30:22.168
"this is where I'm at,
and I feel like I have

30:22.211 --> 30:25.258
"a strong connection with you,
and I just don't...

30:25.301 --> 30:27.086
I just want you to know
what's going on in my head."

30:27.129 --> 30:29.784
If he's equally into me,
he'll be, like, sweet, like

30:29.828 --> 30:31.481
"This hot chick digs me."

30:31.525 --> 30:33.440
- Like, that's awesome.
- Yeah, exactly. Exactly.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.790
'You know, if he's into me,
he'll think it's endearing.'

30:45.408 --> 30:47.846
I'm-I'm sorry.
I'm so distracted by this.

30:47.889 --> 30:50.196
- 'Is that Logan?'
- 'Yeah.'

30:50.239 --> 30:53.112
- It's cute.
- They're just making out again.

30:53.155 --> 30:54.896
I know. I'm like, "Should I be
doing that right now?"

30:54.940 --> 30:57.290
'Can I steal you? He's gonna be
like, "Sorry, I'm in the mi--'

30:57.333 --> 30:59.118
Well, literally, could you
imagine if I did, like

30:59.161 --> 31:02.121
the breaststroke out to them
and then was like, "Excuse me."

31:02.164 --> 31:03.818
- 'Will you do it?'
- 'Oh, my God, if I had..'

31:03.862 --> 31:06.603
If I had a snorkel,
it's over for you bitches.

31:06.647 --> 31:09.041
Like, watch out. I'm coming in.

31:09.084 --> 31:10.694
Ah.

31:10.738 --> 31:13.175
I can for sure
see something with Logan.

31:13.219 --> 31:16.570
And it's exciting just because
I haven't had butterflies

31:16.613 --> 31:20.182
for anyone in a long time.

31:20.226 --> 31:24.317
But it's intimidating because
there's beautiful women here.

31:24.360 --> 31:27.494
And, like, he's hot.
He's a hot commodity.

31:27.537 --> 31:29.931
<i>Shanae 2.0 is not a villain.</i>

31:29.975 --> 31:33.935
<i>But if someone is taking him
away from me</i>

31:33.979 --> 31:38.113
I would be like,
"Don't do it. Don't do it."

31:39.462 --> 31:42.683
Where's everybody? Ugh.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.517
Logan and Shanae are getting it.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.519
She even mentioned
in our girl chat that

31:52.562 --> 31:55.000
that was who she wanted to,
like, connect with, so...

31:55.043 --> 31:57.002
Okay. A little,
little something-something.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.308
They're vibing.
They're really vibing.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.962
Well, it kind of sucks
'cause, like

32:01.006 --> 32:02.790
I vibed with him
a little bit, but...

32:02.833 --> 32:05.010
'Oh..'

32:05.053 --> 32:07.012
Anything can happen in Paradise.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.971
- Everybody's available.
- Everybody's available.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.887
- Yeah. Just gotta steal him.
- Exactly. Exactly.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.194
If he likes me more
at the end of the day

32:15.237 --> 32:17.718
then I'm like, "At least you
explored with everybody else

32:17.761 --> 32:18.980
and, like,
you're picking me now."

32:19.024 --> 32:20.460
- Exactly.
- Yeah, I mean, look at 'em.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.897
'They're just talking, so..'

32:22.941 --> 32:24.246
- Oh.
- 'Okay, alright.'

32:24.290 --> 32:26.553
- 'Oh, damn, damn.'
- 'Oh, oh.'

32:26.596 --> 32:29.382
Yo! My fault. I jinxed it.

32:29.425 --> 32:33.952
That was, that's on me.
That's on me. I apologize.

32:33.995 --> 32:36.911
- 'Fireworks.'
- 'Yeah, spoke too soon.'

32:36.955 --> 32:38.826
'They're still going.'

32:38.869 --> 32:42.569
That could be me right
now. I should have pulled him.

32:42.612 --> 32:45.180
<i>But at this point, I feel I
need to put all the other girls</i>

32:45.224 --> 32:47.400
out of my mind,
because at the end of the day

32:47.443 --> 32:50.011
like, this is my story.

32:50.055 --> 32:51.882
Like, I'm here to find love.

32:51.926 --> 32:54.798
<i>I'm gonna pull him later.
I have to pull him later.</i>

32:54.842 --> 32:57.410
I need some reassurance
that, like, "Hey, I know

32:57.453 --> 33:01.109
"I spent time with Shanae,
but I still am into you also.

33:01.153 --> 33:03.807
And I'm still exploring you
as well."

33:05.548 --> 33:07.724
How you've been?
I haven't seen you all day.

33:07.768 --> 33:10.031
I'm good. I love it here.

33:10.075 --> 33:14.209
Um.. No, it's so nice. I...

33:16.081 --> 33:17.430
I definitely wanted to pull you

33:17.473 --> 33:21.129
but I was like,
I didn't wanna, like, interrupt.

33:22.304 --> 33:24.437
- You talking about today?
- Today.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.526
Oh, yeah, well...

33:26.569 --> 33:30.965
Are you feeling good about,
like, conversations you've had?

33:31.009 --> 33:33.968
Yeah. I'm just
in my sh-shell a lot.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.448
- So.. I'm in my shell.
- You're what?

33:35.491 --> 33:36.927
A lot of the time.

33:36.971 --> 33:38.364
You're in your shallow?

33:38.407 --> 33:41.584
- In my shell, like a snail.
- 'Yeah. Of course.'

33:41.628 --> 33:45.632
You know, and they-they're shy,
so they go in their shell.

33:45.675 --> 33:47.199
- I think that's a turtle.
- You know, that's, like...

33:47.242 --> 33:49.505
- An an-analogy, you know?
- Right, yeah.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.681
Well, when are you,
when are you coming out?

33:51.725 --> 33:55.685
- Hm, maybe tonight.
- What's gonna happen tonight?

33:57.252 --> 33:59.559
I'm just gonna be
chatting it up.

34:01.126 --> 34:02.562
I'll pull you again.

34:02.605 --> 34:04.868
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

34:07.480 --> 34:11.353
Yeah. Um.. No.

34:11.397 --> 34:13.399
It does suck.

34:13.442 --> 34:16.271
<i>You think that you have, like,
a connection with someone</i>

34:16.315 --> 34:19.100
and that they are, like, into
you and you just really vibed

34:19.144 --> 34:21.102
and, like, we were laughing
together and stuff

34:21.146 --> 34:23.974
and then how that can shift,
like, in one day.

34:25.106 --> 34:28.240
But I do feel
a little bit confident

34:28.283 --> 34:30.459
<i>because anything can happen
in Paradise.</i>

34:30.503 --> 34:33.332
<i>I do believe in my connection
with Logan</i>

34:33.375 --> 34:36.465
and I did see it working,
like, in my head.

34:36.509 --> 34:39.729
Ladies and gentlemen,
look what we have here.

34:39.773 --> 34:42.341
- 'Whoo!'
- Date card.

34:42.384 --> 34:44.125
- A date card?
- All hands in.

34:44.169 --> 34:46.171
<i>A date is way more
intimate than just hanging out</i>

34:46.214 --> 34:47.520
<i>here on the beach.</i>

34:47.563 --> 34:48.869
You just have
a shared experience

34:48.912 --> 34:50.349
and it's a unique time to, like

34:50.392 --> 34:53.439
really grow a relationship,
like, substantially.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.223
Hey, guys, come a little closer.
Come on.

34:55.267 --> 34:57.399
- Yeah.
- 'Let's go.'

34:57.443 --> 35:00.359
<i>So obviously, I want my name
to be on the date card.</i>

35:01.099 --> 35:02.665
<i>I'm excited.</i>

35:02.709 --> 35:05.407
<i>I could take Logan
and have my time with him</i>

35:05.451 --> 35:08.410
and kind of grow
what we had the other night.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.418
"Shanae.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.899
It's time to rewrite
your love story."

35:18.942 --> 35:20.944
- Yes, it is!
- Whoo!

35:20.988 --> 35:23.338
Hey, let's go!

35:23.382 --> 35:25.123
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

35:25.166 --> 35:26.211
'You're welcome.'

35:26.254 --> 35:29.127
- I'm freaking out.
- Hey.

35:29.170 --> 35:31.912
Logan, would you like
to join this date with me?

35:31.955 --> 35:33.653
- I'd love to. Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:33.696 --> 35:35.176
- 'Yay!'
- 'Yay!'

35:36.873 --> 35:39.746
Ugh. Gross.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.531
Have fun, you two. Yeah.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.100
That is not what I wanted.

35:46.144 --> 35:47.928
That's not
what any of us wanted.

35:47.971 --> 35:49.930
This is an opportunity
for, you know

35:49.973 --> 35:53.238
her to pursue what she wasn't
able to before, you know?

35:53.281 --> 35:55.805
'Yeah, she's minding her own
business. She likes Logan.'

35:55.849 --> 35:59.592
He clearly likes her, too. And
I think that it's gonna be good.

35:59.635 --> 36:03.117
I'm not trying to fight with,
like, other girls over a guy.

36:04.901 --> 36:06.381
It sucks, like..

36:08.122 --> 36:10.646
...not being picked by the guy

36:10.690 --> 36:12.605
that you have a crush on.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.868
I think
anyone could relate to that.

36:17.131 --> 36:18.741
Excuse me, guys.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.266
It does suck.

36:29.839 --> 36:31.580
'Let's compare scars.
Let's do scar stuff.'

36:31.624 --> 36:33.800
- Yeah, who has a scar?
- I was, like, six years old.

36:33.843 --> 36:36.237
I was running with an umbrella
and I fell.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.239
Got stuck in my head right here.

36:38.283 --> 36:40.981
They had to pull it out
and then stitch it up

36:41.024 --> 36:42.287
and, like, all that, yeah.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.637
But it just missed my eye,
like, by a little bit.

36:44.680 --> 36:47.553
Pulled the handlebar, like,
the rubber off my handlebar

36:47.596 --> 36:49.642
on accident getting up,
and it scooped

36:49.685 --> 36:52.775
a chunk of my knee out
like ice cream.

36:52.819 --> 36:55.038
My friend thought it was funny
to put his finger up my butt.

36:55.082 --> 36:59.739
You know, and I just jumped up
and scraped the whole back.

36:59.782 --> 37:02.829
- I don't have a pinkie!
- You lost a finger?

37:02.872 --> 37:05.310
Oh, my God, that's dope!

37:05.353 --> 37:07.225
- No, look. Stand up.
- This is, like, this is...

37:07.268 --> 37:08.269
It's the best
hand-holding hand.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.489
That is a great hand-hold!

37:11.446 --> 37:13.143
Dude, dude, dude, hold her hand.

37:13.187 --> 37:14.754
Hold on. I'm showing everybody.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.103
What happened to your pinkie?

37:16.146 --> 37:18.279
When I was five,
a swing set fell on me

37:18.323 --> 37:19.498
and a pole cut it off.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.717
Oh, my God!
I didn't even notice!

37:21.761 --> 37:23.676
I get ten percent off
when I get my nails done.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.069
Oh, yeah! Hey!

37:26.113 --> 37:27.680
- Hey!
- She's a saver.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.509
'Where do you think
you're going?'

37:30.552 --> 37:32.511
- I have no clue.
- 'What did the date card say?'

37:32.554 --> 37:35.949
Date card said time to rewrite
our love story.

37:35.992 --> 37:37.777
- She chose you.
- 'Chose me. Who knew?'

37:37.820 --> 37:39.866
- I still can't believe it.
- What?

37:39.909 --> 37:41.911
- 'What is happening here?'
- 'I don't know, man.'

37:41.955 --> 37:44.523
'Crazier things
have happened here, man.'

37:44.566 --> 37:47.874
Well, we'll see.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.572
It just, like, sucks
'cause, like, the one person

37:50.616 --> 37:52.313
that I had
a really strong connection with

37:52.357 --> 37:54.837
and, like, I actually feel,
like, butterflies about

37:54.881 --> 37:56.970
<i>is going on a date with someone
else, and they've already spent</i>

37:57.013 --> 38:00.408
<i>all day with that person. Like,
quality time is a big deal.</i>

38:00.452 --> 38:04.630
And I think they're gonna come
back and literally be, like...

38:04.673 --> 38:07.241
- 'Go get 'em, tiger.'
- 'Have a good night, bud.'

38:07.285 --> 38:08.851
- See ya.
- 'See you, guys.'

38:08.895 --> 38:11.245
That stings.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.594
It stings.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.645
"Paradise" is off
to a great start.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.821
<i>I got a date with
a beautiful woman tonight.</i>

38:21.864 --> 38:23.692
I could not be happier.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.782
One-on-one
with the girl I wanna be with.

38:26.826 --> 38:29.742
Nothing better. I think
we're gonna have a ton of fun.

38:40.013 --> 38:42.363
The date card said,
"Are you ready

38:42.407 --> 38:43.886
<i>to rewrite your love story?"</i>

38:43.930 --> 38:46.106
- You can move.
- You think so? Yeah.

38:46.149 --> 38:48.151
<i>I never had a love story
on Clayton's season</i>

38:48.195 --> 38:50.371
but I'm about
to rewrite history.

38:50.415 --> 38:52.417
<i>Logan really makes me
feel comfortable</i>

38:52.460 --> 38:56.290
<i>so I can be myself,
so it feels good.</i>

38:56.334 --> 38:57.857
And it's my time to shine.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.729
- This is fun.
- Well...

39:00.773 --> 39:01.904
I feel like we're, like

39:01.948 --> 39:04.385
fitting perfect, no?

39:04.429 --> 39:08.346
Like, me, Shanae
had a really hard experience

39:08.389 --> 39:10.130
when she went on this show.

39:10.173 --> 39:11.914
<i>All Shanae ever wanted
was to be wanted</i>

39:11.958 --> 39:14.526
and to be treated like somebody
who deserves a date

39:14.569 --> 39:16.354
who deserves
the door opened for her

39:16.397 --> 39:18.399
who deserves to be kissed
and to be wanted.

39:18.443 --> 39:20.401
<i>So I think we both get a chance</i>

39:20.445 --> 39:22.838
<i>to kinda come together
and rewrite this story</i>

39:22.882 --> 39:24.579
that didn't end well for us.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.974
There's honestly no one else
I'd rather be here with.

39:28.017 --> 39:29.889
And I mean that.

39:29.932 --> 39:30.977
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

39:37.244 --> 39:38.550
We're kind of in the same boat.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.116
- Aren't we?
- Yeah.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.162
I hate to be that person
that's like

39:42.205 --> 39:44.382
"I-I hope
they don't end up together."

39:44.425 --> 39:46.035
But, like,
Logan was my number one.

39:46.079 --> 39:48.951
Like, Logan was the one
I had, like, sparks with.

39:48.995 --> 39:52.999
This is a man that's literally
telling me that he likes me.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.480
And then Shanae spent all day
with him and I didn't wanna be

39:55.523 --> 39:57.917
that catty bitch to, like,
pull him

39:57.960 --> 40:01.050
while he's hanging out with her,
but he was with her all day.

40:01.094 --> 40:02.617
And then for her to get
the date card and, like--

40:02.661 --> 40:04.402
They don't leave
each other's side.

40:04.445 --> 40:05.968
I feel bad because that is

40:06.012 --> 40:08.580
<i>Hailey's strongest connection
at the moment.</i>

40:08.623 --> 40:10.364
I don't know
what to believe with Shanae.

40:10.408 --> 40:11.496
I wanna believe the best.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.541
<i>She seems very into Logan.</i>

40:13.585 --> 40:15.978
Maybe he's just giving her the
benefit of the doubt and seeing

40:16.022 --> 40:18.981
but, like, at the same time,
that's exactly what Clayton did.

40:19.025 --> 40:20.809
And it's not like
she acted different to his face.

40:20.853 --> 40:23.682
It was behind the scenes.
So I don't know.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.205
Whatever, she's staying
out of my way and that's all

40:25.248 --> 40:26.772
I care about, but it sucks that

40:26.815 --> 40:29.078
it's, like,
the guy that you like, too.

40:29.122 --> 40:30.297
I do really like him.

40:30.340 --> 40:32.342
I'm not the best at reading guys

40:32.386 --> 40:35.955
and I'm not the best
at telling red flags...

40:37.609 --> 40:39.524
...'cause sometimes they come
with just really pretty

40:39.567 --> 40:42.352
blue eyes and a nice smile.

40:42.396 --> 40:45.138
So I don't know
what's gonna happen or

40:45.181 --> 40:46.618
who else is gonna break my heart

40:46.661 --> 40:50.622
or who's not gonna break
my heart.

40:50.665 --> 40:53.886
I just hope
that my person comes.

40:56.323 --> 40:59.718
Or maybe Logan will get
his head out of his ass

40:59.761 --> 41:01.589
and want another chance,
and then I'll have to be like

41:01.633 --> 41:03.548
"Okay, maybe
I'll give you another chance.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.288
"But I'll have to think
long and hard about it

41:05.332 --> 41:07.421
and make you grovel."

41:09.510 --> 41:12.426
- How are you doing?
- I'm so good.

41:12.470 --> 41:13.906
It's cool to see
this side of you.

41:13.949 --> 41:17.431
Like, what I wanted from tonight
was, like--

41:17.475 --> 41:20.042
- This?
- I wanted you to be on a date.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.784
- I know. Yeah.
- And I wanted you to smile.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.613
And I wanted to make you laugh
and I wanted--

41:25.657 --> 41:28.747
- And you're doing all of that.
- Well, that's what I want.

41:28.790 --> 41:31.967
No, like, and that's what
I'm saying. Like, it feels good.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.447
You're, like...

41:33.491 --> 41:37.233
I've-I've felt
like an outcast before

41:37.277 --> 41:39.018
like, for a lot of my life.

41:39.061 --> 41:43.544
And I see how, like, brave
you've been to-to come back.

41:43.588 --> 41:45.590
- Yeah.
- And...

41:45.633 --> 41:48.114
For you to, like,
be amongst other people

41:48.157 --> 41:53.336
who put you down
in a public way, and to return

41:53.380 --> 41:55.121
I see so much, like, strength
in you.

41:55.164 --> 41:56.992
- Yeah.
- And it's...

41:57.036 --> 41:59.125
I'm so attracted to it.

41:59.168 --> 42:00.474
You make me feel comfortable.

42:00.518 --> 42:01.954
And, like,
I haven't had that in a while.

42:01.997 --> 42:04.304
- Yeah.
- So, like, I like it.

42:04.347 --> 42:06.262
But it's scary, I mean, like

42:06.306 --> 42:09.309
I've been cheated on
in every relationship.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.137
Like, it's hard for me
to open up.

42:11.180 --> 42:14.488
Uh, but I'm smitten.
I have butterflies with you.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.403
Like, you're fun.
You make me laugh.

42:16.446 --> 42:17.622
Like, you make me
feel comfortable.

42:17.665 --> 42:20.407
I do like you
and I feel something with you.

42:20.450 --> 42:22.322
So I-I think that's scary, too,
in a sense

42:22.365 --> 42:24.585
because I haven't felt that
in a long time.

42:24.629 --> 42:28.720
But I see this going,
like, really good.

42:29.851 --> 42:31.374
Me, too.

42:31.418 --> 42:34.116
- I'm excited about this week.
- Yeah, I'm excited, too.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.001
- You ready?
- Ready.

42:49.044 --> 42:51.656
I never thought, coming in here,
I would feel like this

42:51.699 --> 42:54.397
like guys would
even have my back.

42:54.441 --> 42:57.575
Logan makes me
feel comfortable, secure.

42:57.618 --> 43:00.621
<i>Like, I can be myself. I feel
like he doesn't judge me.</i>

43:00.665 --> 43:01.927
<i>I came here with intention</i>

43:01.970 --> 43:03.015
and my intention

43:03.058 --> 43:05.234
is to find my person.

43:05.278 --> 43:08.063
<i>Logan could be that person,
for sure.</i>

43:21.729 --> 43:24.210
So what's your plan tonight,
Jill?

43:24.253 --> 43:25.690
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

43:25.733 --> 43:27.256
- Absolutely nothing.
- You're just okay with--

43:27.300 --> 43:29.781
I'm-I'm, literally,
I am going home tomorrow.

43:29.824 --> 43:30.869
- I've accepted it.
- No.

43:30.912 --> 43:32.479
I mean, once Justin gets back

43:32.522 --> 43:33.785
I will just, I-I don't know

43:33.828 --> 43:36.178
have a conversation with him

43:36.222 --> 43:37.702
see what he says.

43:37.745 --> 43:39.399
If it's like, "I'm confused
and I gotta

43:39.442 --> 43:41.357
figure it out,"
I don't want.. Mn-mn.

43:41.401 --> 43:43.316
Justin and I
have a good connection going

43:43.359 --> 43:46.014
and both said, like, we were
enjoying each other's company.

43:46.058 --> 43:48.234
But Victoria walked in
and had a date card

43:48.277 --> 43:49.670
<i>and she picked him.</i>

43:49.714 --> 43:51.977
For all I know,
they could come in making out.

43:52.020 --> 43:53.674
And, like, I don't know.

43:53.718 --> 43:55.894
Imagine if Salley came now.

43:55.937 --> 43:59.375
I thought it was gonna be Salley
to come in and take him.

43:59.419 --> 44:01.769
<i>It was all over Instagram
that a ton of people</i>

44:01.813 --> 44:03.553
<i>from Bachelor Nation
went to Stagecoach</i>

44:03.597 --> 44:07.253
<i>and Salley was all over Justin,
Justin was all over Salley.</i>

44:07.296 --> 44:09.472
So I wasn't expecting Victoria.

44:09.516 --> 44:11.736
Like, I'm expecting him

44:11.779 --> 44:15.130
right there with her,
holding hands, and I...

44:15.174 --> 44:17.698
But he's never met her before,
you know--

44:17.742 --> 44:19.352
He never met me before.

44:19.395 --> 44:20.701
<i>Tonight sucks.</i>

44:20.745 --> 44:22.181
I just have to wait
for him to come back

44:22.224 --> 44:24.313
and tell me what he thinks.

44:24.357 --> 44:26.707
<i>But I'm trying to stay hopeful.</i>

44:26.751 --> 44:29.144
<i>I mean,
at least it's not Salley.</i>

44:43.681 --> 44:45.683
'Who's Salley?'

44:45.726 --> 44:48.816
So I'm getting ready
and I found Salley's bag

44:48.860 --> 44:51.253
but it's like there's no Salley

44:51.297 --> 44:54.126
<i>and I'm so confused right now.</i>

44:54.169 --> 44:56.215
- It's fine. I don't know.
- Yeah.

44:56.258 --> 44:58.652
- Like, it--
- No, be honest.

44:58.696 --> 45:00.523
It sucks.

45:00.567 --> 45:02.656
<i>I don't know who Salley is</i>

45:02.700 --> 45:04.745
but I'm determined
to figure that out.

45:04.789 --> 45:07.182
But I feel like
there's still tomorrow

45:07.226 --> 45:10.359
and there's still
cocktail party.

45:10.403 --> 45:12.666
- Hey. Guys.
- Hi.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.190
- Hey.
- Sorry to interrupt you.

45:15.234 --> 45:18.237
Like, something's in our room.
Like, I gotta show you guys.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.456
- Are you lying?
- No, I.. No. I swear to God.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.154
- Like--
- Like, an animal, a crab?

45:22.197 --> 45:23.808
Oh, guys, it's about a person.
Let's go.

45:23.851 --> 45:26.549
A person?
A person is in our room? No way.

45:26.593 --> 45:28.726
Is it another girl?

45:28.769 --> 45:29.988
What's going on, dude?

45:30.031 --> 45:31.816
It's gonna be Justin
in our beds.

45:31.859 --> 45:35.645
What is going on there?
They're all running.

45:38.083 --> 45:39.824
Why are you guys running?
I can't keep up.

45:39.867 --> 45:42.609
'Cause you're telling us
something's going on!

45:46.047 --> 45:48.354
- What? What is it?
- What? What is it?

45:48.397 --> 45:51.705
- Guys. I'm not kidding.
- Salley.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.794
No, like, guys,
what the [bleep]?

45:53.838 --> 45:56.275
So we go upstairs,
and a suitcase is there.

45:56.318 --> 45:58.581
And we turn it,
and it says Salley.

45:59.582 --> 46:02.020
Oh, my God.

46:02.063 --> 46:05.284
Where is she? If-if her luggage
is here, where is she?

46:05.327 --> 46:07.808
There's only one bag?
What are we doing with it?

46:07.852 --> 46:09.592
- 'Is there another Salley?'
- I'm confused.

46:09.636 --> 46:11.769
I don't know who Salley is.

46:11.812 --> 46:15.120
Salley is from
Clayton's season.

46:15.163 --> 46:18.776
Well, Salley is loosely
from Clayton's season.

46:18.819 --> 46:21.300
<i>None of the girls
actually met her.</i>

46:21.343 --> 46:22.954
I want to accept that rose.

46:22.997 --> 46:26.261
My heart is just
not in a place where I can.

46:26.305 --> 46:29.047
<i>She went back to her fiance,
then they broke up.</i>

46:29.090 --> 46:31.876
Then they got back together.
Rinse and repeat.

46:31.919 --> 46:33.921
I wanna open the bag so bad.

46:42.887 --> 46:44.105
'Y'all.'

46:48.327 --> 46:51.243
So she doesn't have
her extensions.

46:51.286 --> 46:54.246
I'm just trying to figure out
why Salley's stuff is here.

46:54.289 --> 46:56.030
Why are you bringing
a waffle-maker?

46:56.074 --> 46:58.728
Because we gave her that
at "The Women Tell All"

46:58.772 --> 47:01.079
for her, like, wedding present.

47:01.122 --> 47:02.776
I'm so confused.

47:02.820 --> 47:05.126
I'm so weirded out.

47:06.954 --> 47:09.130
Are you kidding me?

47:09.174 --> 47:11.263
I...

47:11.306 --> 47:13.613
- 'No.'
- I can't.

47:13.656 --> 47:17.051
There was a vibrator
in her suitcase going off.

47:17.095 --> 47:20.315
I truly don't even know
where to begin.

47:21.403 --> 47:22.796
Ah! What?

47:22.840 --> 47:24.885
What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

47:24.929 --> 47:27.061
'You didn't--'

47:27.105 --> 47:29.324
Ew!

47:29.368 --> 47:32.197
Ah! Stop!

47:32.240 --> 47:34.025
Oh, my God!

47:34.068 --> 47:37.898
I'm sorry.
I have a vibrator myself.

47:37.942 --> 47:42.511
We got her vibrator
in her hair extensions.

47:45.558 --> 47:47.473
Turn it off!

47:47.516 --> 47:49.257
I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

47:49.301 --> 47:51.433
<i>I don't know anything
at this point.</i>

47:51.477 --> 47:54.306
I don't know. I have no idea.

47:54.349 --> 47:57.048
We sprinted up those stairs
to find a vibrator.

47:57.091 --> 48:00.660
To find a vibrator. I didn't
know those were allowed.

48:02.140 --> 48:04.620
We know she's coming.
She'll be here bright and early.

48:04.664 --> 48:06.840
- You think?
- 'I'm so sure.'

48:06.884 --> 48:09.147
She's beautiful.

48:09.190 --> 48:11.845
And I'm sure that she'll catch
somebody's eye.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.152
So Salley's here, too.
This is perfect.

48:14.195 --> 48:15.936
So Justin gets back and then
gets to talk to Salley.

48:15.980 --> 48:16.981
And I'm just, like, still here.

48:17.024 --> 48:18.504
It's the most ridiculous thing.

48:18.547 --> 48:21.072
The one thing that could, like,
set you over the edge.

48:21.115 --> 48:24.640
Right, like, this makes me
literally not want to be here

48:24.684 --> 48:27.556
like, want to go
pack my bags and just go.

48:27.600 --> 48:30.864
If she shows up,
all hell is gonna break loose.

48:30.908 --> 48:33.258
Torture me more.

48:33.301 --> 48:34.868
Ah!

48:34.912 --> 48:36.696
What do I do? I hate this.

48:36.739 --> 48:39.133
<i>I cannot believe this.</i>

48:43.921 --> 48:45.879
- 'Where is she?'
- I don't know.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.359
- Like-like I need this.
- Yeah.

48:47.402 --> 48:49.143
This is just what I need.
He's already on a date.

48:49.187 --> 48:50.536
- Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah.

48:50.579 --> 48:52.016
<i>This is the worst day ever.</i>

48:52.059 --> 48:53.800
Like, running up and down
the stairs to go look

48:53.843 --> 48:55.584
at Salley's suitcase
when Salley's not here.

48:55.628 --> 48:58.283
<i>And I know the story
with her and Justin.</i>

48:58.326 --> 48:59.980
Like, I've heard Salley
maybe one time

49:00.024 --> 49:01.982
and I don't know who she is
or what's happening.

49:02.026 --> 49:03.941
No one knows
if she's coming or not

49:03.984 --> 49:06.334
but, uh, uh, I don't know.

49:06.378 --> 49:07.727
But her bag was there.

49:07.770 --> 49:10.077
Wells, do you, do you know...

49:10.121 --> 49:12.340
Do you know anything?
There's, like, a bag.

49:12.384 --> 49:14.864
Do you know anything
about a Salley?

49:14.908 --> 49:16.779
- Yes, I do.
- Who's Salley?

49:16.823 --> 49:18.738
- Do you know her?
- Uh, never met her.

49:18.781 --> 49:20.522
Just heard crazy things.

49:20.566 --> 49:25.005
So listen, are you guys ready
for, uh, Wells' storytime?

49:25.049 --> 49:26.050
- Yeah. We'd love to hear.
- 'Yeah?'

49:26.093 --> 49:27.703
- 'Yeah.'
- I think.

49:27.747 --> 49:31.751
Alright, this is "The Saga
Of Salley's Suitcase."

49:34.449 --> 49:36.930
Salley is on Clayton's season.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.801
<i>She was, like, engaged beforehand.</i>

49:38.845 --> 49:42.327
<i>She showed up. She never even
got out of her limo.</i>

49:43.502 --> 49:45.808
'So she wanted
a second shot at love'

49:45.852 --> 49:47.245
and we wanted
to grant that to her

49:47.288 --> 49:49.160
'but we were
a little apprehensive.'

49:49.203 --> 49:52.076
I mean, she didn't even get out
of the limo the first time.

49:52.119 --> 49:55.644
So we decided to send a producer

49:55.688 --> 49:59.431
<i>to make sure
that she got on her flight.</i>

49:59.474 --> 50:02.825
A Paradise Sherpa,
if you will, alright?

50:02.869 --> 50:05.872
- Mm-hmm.
- 'She gets to Salley's house.'

50:05.915 --> 50:08.483
<i>She texts her, "I've got a huge
surprise for you outside.</i>

50:08.527 --> 50:10.224
<i>Come outside.
Come outside right now."</i>

50:10.268 --> 50:11.921
<i>Salley texts back,
"I can't, I have</i>

50:11.965 --> 50:14.228
<i>explosive diarrhea right now."</i>

50:14.272 --> 50:16.535
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

50:16.578 --> 50:18.189
- Well, this is--
- Too much for me.

50:18.232 --> 50:20.104
- Interesting.
- Is she not here?

50:20.147 --> 50:21.888
- 'Hear me out.'
- Okay, sorry. Go ahead.

50:21.931 --> 50:23.107
- Let me tell the story.
- 'Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.'

50:23.150 --> 50:24.717
Sorry, I'm freaking out.

50:24.760 --> 50:25.979
So she bangs on the door, right?

50:26.023 --> 50:27.807
- Yeah.
- 'Yeah.'

50:29.026 --> 50:30.288
<i>The door opens.</i>

50:30.331 --> 50:31.637
It's gonna be Salley, right?

50:31.680 --> 50:32.986
It's a man.

50:33.943 --> 50:35.206
<i>It's a man.</i>

50:35.249 --> 50:36.816
- Whoo! She's not here!
- 'Hold on.'

50:36.859 --> 50:38.992
- It gets better.
- 'Okay.'

50:39.036 --> 50:43.127
<i>The man yells,
"Salley ain't here!"</i>

50:43.170 --> 50:45.825
The producer is like,
"What is going on?"

50:45.868 --> 50:48.784
So she immediately texts Salley.

50:48.828 --> 50:52.919
<i>She's like, "Dude, I'm here
to get you to Paradise.</i>

50:52.962 --> 50:55.661
Get your ass home right now."

50:55.704 --> 50:58.098
Four hours later,
she shows up at the hotel

50:58.142 --> 50:59.752
where the producer is.

50:59.795 --> 51:02.711
<i>"I really wanna go to Paradise.
I'm really ready."</i>

51:02.755 --> 51:04.670
<i>"Okay, great. Are you packed?"</i>

51:04.713 --> 51:06.280
<i>"No."</i>

51:06.324 --> 51:07.760
<i>"What do you need to do?"</i>

51:07.803 --> 51:10.893
"I really wanna go see my ex
and talk to him."

51:10.937 --> 51:12.678
'Her ex,
she was engaged to him.'

51:12.721 --> 51:13.940
- 'Oh.'
- Okay.

51:13.983 --> 51:16.725
So she goes to the ex's house.

51:16.769 --> 51:18.684
<i>It's a freaking mansion.</i>

51:18.727 --> 51:21.469
<i>And she freaks out and she says
"Listen, if he sees you in the</i>

51:21.513 --> 51:23.776
<i>car, he's gonna lose his mind.
You need to get in the back."</i>

51:23.819 --> 51:25.647
<i>So she gets out,
she goes in the back, she goes</i>

51:25.691 --> 51:28.215
<i>"No, not in the back.
You need to get in the trunk."</i>

51:29.738 --> 51:32.306
<i>So the producer
gets in the trunk.</i>

51:32.350 --> 51:35.179
- Tell me this is serious.
- This is dead freaking serious.

51:35.222 --> 51:36.832
- Not serious!
- 'This is real.'

51:36.876 --> 51:38.225
- No!
- 'There's no way.'

51:38.269 --> 51:40.575
- 'I'm telling you--'
- 'I believe this. I believe--'

51:40.619 --> 51:43.230
You can talk to the producer
if you want to.

51:43.274 --> 51:45.711
- 'Alright.'
- So she gets in the trunk.

51:45.754 --> 51:48.105
<i>She goes, "Don't worry. It's
gonna take ten minutes, okay?</i>

51:48.148 --> 51:50.063
<i>Ten minutes, and I'll be back."</i>

51:52.239 --> 51:54.546
<i>Ten minutes turns into twenty.
Twenty turns into an hour.</i>

51:54.589 --> 51:57.201
<i>An hour turns into two.</i>

51:57.244 --> 51:58.985
<i>Two hours turns into three.</i>

51:59.028 --> 52:03.163
<i>At four hours,
finally Salley emerges.</i>

52:03.207 --> 52:06.210
<i>She says, "He said
he's no longer in love with me</i>

52:06.253 --> 52:07.646
<i>and he wants me
to go to Paradise."</i>

52:07.689 --> 52:09.735
<i>We're thinking,
"This is great." No.</i>

52:09.778 --> 52:12.564
<i>Not the case. Now she's
even more crestfallen.</i>

52:12.607 --> 52:15.436
'She's upset. We don't know
what's gonna happen.'

52:15.480 --> 52:17.264
Wake up the next morning,
Salley's in.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.745
She's coming to Paradise.

52:19.788 --> 52:23.183
<i>This is great. This is great
news. They get her packed up.</i>

52:27.144 --> 52:28.667
<i>They get to the airport.</i>

52:29.972 --> 52:31.800
<i>They check in.</i>

52:31.844 --> 52:34.586
<i>Bag's through security.</i>

52:34.629 --> 52:38.416
They're at the gate. All of
a sudden, producer looks back.

52:38.459 --> 52:39.982
<i>Salley's on the phone
with somebody.</i>

52:40.026 --> 52:42.420
<i>She's crying uncontrollably.</i>

52:42.463 --> 52:44.552
'She's on the phone
with the freaking ex.'

52:44.596 --> 52:47.207
'The gate agent's like
"You guys need to board.'

52:47.251 --> 52:49.209
'The flight is leaving."'

52:49.253 --> 52:51.385
<i>And sees two women
yelling at each other</i>

52:51.429 --> 52:53.039
<i>"Are you gonna come?
Are you not gonna come?"</i>

52:53.082 --> 52:55.084
<i>Crying, hugging, freaking out.</i>

52:55.128 --> 52:57.304
<i>And the producer says,
"You have to make a decision.</i>

52:57.348 --> 52:59.567
<i>"Do you wanna stay with someone</i>

52:59.611 --> 53:01.787
"who has said
that they don't love you

53:01.830 --> 53:03.963
"and want you to go to Paradise

53:04.006 --> 53:05.225
"or do you wanna go to Paradise

53:05.269 --> 53:09.142
and find maybe your person?"

53:10.274 --> 53:11.623
<i>She's frozen.</i>

53:13.538 --> 53:16.497
<i>The gate agent's like,
"We gotta go."</i>

53:19.196 --> 53:21.502
<i>Producer gets on the plane.</i>

53:21.546 --> 53:24.288
<i>Salley does not get
on the flight.</i>

53:26.072 --> 53:27.639
- Bet.
- Is that the end?

53:27.682 --> 53:29.423
Her bags got here.

53:29.467 --> 53:31.469
Because we checked her in!

53:31.512 --> 53:35.037
Her bags are in Paradise
because they were on the plane.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.648
- 'Um, wow.'
- Like, why does this--

53:36.691 --> 53:38.476
Is she coming, though?
Is she gonna get here?

53:38.519 --> 53:41.653
As of today,
she said she's coming.

53:41.696 --> 53:44.221
Is she coming today? Is she
coming tomorrow? I don't know.

53:44.264 --> 53:47.267
She's gonna show up here
and [bleep] all our chances up?

53:47.311 --> 53:49.313
Well, how's it going down here?

53:49.356 --> 53:52.446
Guess who you can expect. Salley.

53:52.490 --> 53:54.840
- 'Wait, Salley's here?'
- Salley's bags are here.

53:54.883 --> 53:57.712
'So she sends her bags out
in advance?'

53:57.756 --> 54:00.193
Well, she was gonna board the
plane, and then she backed out.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.934
Hey, I gotta pray
for my boy Justin.

54:01.977 --> 54:04.197
I'mma pour one out for him.

54:04.241 --> 54:06.895
Is that a dildo? I love that.'

54:06.939 --> 54:08.680
- Oh.
- 'Wait, you went into her bag?'

54:08.723 --> 54:12.466
The producer was in the trunk
of the car four hours.

54:12.510 --> 54:14.381
'Be careful, though.
She's very attractive.'

54:14.425 --> 54:16.514
- So she might be your type.
- Oh, God.

54:16.557 --> 54:18.994
- Yeah. Yeah, she's a stunner.
- Seriously?

54:19.038 --> 54:22.389
She's gonna create havoc
on this beach.

54:22.433 --> 54:24.217
This feels like [bleep] torture.

54:24.261 --> 54:27.481
It actually feels terrible.

54:27.525 --> 54:29.744
Salley could show up
any second.

54:29.788 --> 54:31.790
Justin could get back
any second.

54:31.833 --> 54:34.836
Are you afraid that if she shows
up, that Justin is gonna be

54:34.880 --> 54:36.925
interested in her?
'Cause I was at Stagecoach.

54:36.969 --> 54:41.365
Like, they were all over each
other. It was really weird.

54:41.408 --> 54:43.149
We were all just, like,
hanging out

54:43.192 --> 54:44.672
being friendly, being chill.

54:44.716 --> 54:47.414
And he was, like,
just focusing on Salley

54:47.458 --> 54:50.069
not talking to anyone else
in the group.

54:50.112 --> 54:51.679
- At Stagecoach.
- Yeah, that's weird.

54:51.723 --> 54:55.117
He basically was ignoring
everyone else there

54:55.161 --> 54:57.859
just to, like, mack on Salley.

55:00.209 --> 55:01.210
I don't know.

55:01.254 --> 55:02.516
I think that Genevieve has a lot

55:02.560 --> 55:04.344
to be worried about, I think

55:04.388 --> 55:07.304
that Justin is
really interested in Salley

55:07.347 --> 55:11.003
and he could be swayed
towards Salley.

55:11.046 --> 55:12.265
And I think
if she gets on the beach

55:12.309 --> 55:14.136
she's gonna be very messy.

55:14.180 --> 55:16.487
I think so, too.
I think it's gonna be bad--

55:16.530 --> 55:18.837
And that's why I'm, like,
really worried.

55:21.666 --> 55:24.408
I don't know.
I actually don't know.

55:24.451 --> 55:27.324
I can't believe it's day two.

55:27.367 --> 55:29.238
Oh, God, I wish
America could, like, feel

55:29.282 --> 55:31.415
what I feel right now.

55:31.458 --> 55:35.549
I don't know, like, what more
can happen to me tonight.

55:35.593 --> 55:37.638
<i>If Justin comes back engaged..</i>

55:38.944 --> 55:41.076
<i>...ah, I don't even know
what to think.</i>

55:41.120 --> 55:43.035
<i>My head is spinning.</i>

55:43.078 --> 55:47.169
<i>I'm two seconds from packing,
two seconds from packing.</i>

55:51.304 --> 55:55.134
How much more can I cry today?

55:55.177 --> 55:58.964
- We won't, okay? Hey, hey.
- Don't wanna do this anymore.

55:59.007 --> 56:01.314
I wanna go home.

56:01.358 --> 56:05.187
I wanna go home...

56:08.016 --> 56:10.149
To Salley!

56:10.192 --> 56:12.630
- Salley!
- Salley!

56:12.673 --> 56:14.196
'Who took the vibrator?'

56:18.679 --> 56:21.813
I don't know
where Salley's vibrator went.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.423
What vibrator?

56:41.528 --> 56:42.877
How do you feel, Genevieve?

56:42.921 --> 56:44.749
- I'm fine. I'm actually fine.
- Yeah.

56:44.792 --> 56:46.446
I would be crying
if I wasn't fine.

56:46.490 --> 56:48.187
That's true,
'cause she's very, very, very

56:48.230 --> 56:49.884
out there
with her emotions, so...

56:49.928 --> 56:52.757
So today
while Justin and Victoria

56:52.800 --> 56:55.368
are on the date,
I've had a terrible day.

56:55.412 --> 56:57.849
Obviously, he's gonna have
a good time, best scenario

56:57.892 --> 56:59.938
<i>like, he comes back
and he's like, "I feel a better</i>

56:59.981 --> 57:03.028
<i>connection with you." But
I'm terrified to talk to him.</i>

57:03.071 --> 57:07.641
And it's my birthday. I don't
wanna go home on my birthday.

57:09.513 --> 57:11.515
I always cry on my birthday.

57:11.558 --> 57:12.907
Do you think you're gonna talk
to him tonight, do you wanna

57:12.951 --> 57:15.519
go up and try
to get some time with him?

57:15.562 --> 57:18.478
Well, honestly, like, I think
he just owes me an answer

57:18.522 --> 57:20.698
like, "I liked her or not." Um...

57:20.741 --> 57:24.223
So hopefully, he just,
I don't know, tells me that.

57:24.266 --> 57:27.356
- That's all I'm looking for.
- 'Oh, here they come.'

57:27.400 --> 57:29.707
- My boy.
- What's up, guys?

57:29.750 --> 57:32.274
- 'Oh, how are you doing?'
- 'Welcome back, baby.'

57:32.318 --> 57:34.451
- Oh, and here they are.
- How you doing, honey?

57:34.494 --> 57:36.540
- You know we were-- Hi!
- Nice to see you.

57:36.583 --> 57:38.411
Does she have his shirt on?

57:38.455 --> 57:41.414
It seriously is all up to him,
and he knows that.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.852
<i>He has the rose,
but I don't want to chase him.</i>

57:44.896 --> 57:47.420
Who wants to be second
or even an option?

57:47.464 --> 57:50.423
'Cause basically,
you're one of two options.

57:50.467 --> 57:52.381
I-I don't wanna
talk about it anymore.

57:52.425 --> 57:54.079
- To be honest.
- Yeah.

57:54.122 --> 57:57.430
This was literally my fear
coming in here.

57:57.474 --> 58:01.260
Exact fear.
And it-it was with Justin, too.

58:01.303 --> 58:03.262
<i>And, like, this whole time
I've been thinking</i>

58:03.305 --> 58:05.656
<i>he was waiting for Salley.</i>

58:05.699 --> 58:07.745
But I wasn't expecting this one.

58:10.487 --> 58:11.923
'Well, the thing is,
me and Victoria had a really'

58:11.966 --> 58:14.273
good date, like, yeah,
it was just, like...

58:14.316 --> 58:16.231
'Yeah. Yeah, no, no.
And you guys came back--'

58:16.275 --> 58:17.842
That's exactly
how you said it, yeah.

58:17.885 --> 58:20.888
'I was like, dude, I was like,
"Dude, that's a good sign."'

58:20.932 --> 58:22.629
'And I feel like
she challenges you in a way'

58:22.673 --> 58:24.544
'that not many people can.'

58:24.588 --> 58:26.503
And I think
you love the challenge.

58:26.546 --> 58:28.766
And that's, like, something
that you step your game up.

58:28.809 --> 58:30.594
- Yeah.
- 'That's good, though, bro.'

58:30.637 --> 58:33.292
'And I'm just happy to see you,
like, put yourself..'

58:33.335 --> 58:36.251
- 'Yeah, man, I'm happy.'
- 'In that kind of position.'

58:36.295 --> 58:38.776
Well, when do you plan
to talk to him?

58:38.819 --> 58:40.168
I don't.

58:40.212 --> 58:41.605
Oh, you want him
to come talk to you?

58:41.648 --> 58:44.085
- I-I honestly don't care.
- Okay.

58:44.129 --> 58:48.568
Like, uh, I kinda
just want an answer

58:48.612 --> 58:51.353
'cause I'm honestly seeing
little things I don't like.

58:51.397 --> 58:52.616
- Yeah. I don't...
- Like, this morning...

58:52.659 --> 58:54.748
He didn't come to me
and say hi right away.

58:54.792 --> 58:56.271
- He slowly made his way.
- Oh.

58:56.315 --> 58:57.751
I was like,
"Mn-mn, I want someone

58:57.795 --> 58:59.884
to come right to me
and say good morning."

58:59.927 --> 59:01.276
Right.

59:01.320 --> 59:03.801
- So I'm like, "Hm.."
- Mm-hmm.

59:03.844 --> 59:06.847
"Maybe I don't like that."

59:06.891 --> 59:10.372
<i>I deserve to be treated
with all the love</i>

59:10.416 --> 59:12.810
<i>and affection and effort.</i>

59:12.853 --> 59:14.855
You coming back
and not even looking at me

59:14.899 --> 59:18.206
not talking to me, not saying
anything to me for an hour

59:18.250 --> 59:20.513
<i>that was ridiculous.</i>

59:20.557 --> 59:25.779
So what am I supposed to do?
Nothing.

59:25.823 --> 59:27.607
I'm gonna talk to Genevieve
in a second.

59:27.651 --> 59:29.435
- Oh, yeah.
- How did she seem?

59:29.478 --> 59:33.439
She's been ups...
Like, moan-y and...

59:33.482 --> 59:36.834
Like, kinda, like,
pouting all day.

59:36.877 --> 59:38.966
'I don't wanna feel like
I'm walking on eggshells.'

59:39.010 --> 59:42.274
I mean, I think, I think
tonight could be very telling

59:42.317 --> 59:43.797
because I want to, um, obviously

59:43.841 --> 59:45.538
I'm gonna talk
to Genevieve fi-first.

59:45.582 --> 59:47.018
'And I wanna see, like,
how she reacts.'

59:47.061 --> 59:49.673
- 'How that conversation goes.'
- 'Yeah.'

59:49.716 --> 59:52.023
It just sucks, like,
'cause at the end of this, like

59:52.066 --> 59:54.068
somebody's feelings are gonna
get hurt. You know what I mean?

59:54.112 --> 59:55.679
And actually,
it's her birthday today.

59:55.722 --> 59:57.463
- 'Yeah.'
- Tomorrow.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.030
- 'Today. It's 12 a.m.'
- Check your clock.

59:59.073 --> 1:00:01.641
... It is past...
I don't know what time it is.

1:00:01.685 --> 1:00:04.731
- It's-it's her birthday.
- 'It's past, yeah.'

1:00:04.775 --> 1:00:05.732
Yeah.

1:00:06.864 --> 1:00:09.301
"Happy birthday. Ha-ha.

1:00:09.344 --> 1:00:10.911
'Had a great time on the date."'

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:14.175
Tonight in particular is tough

1:00:14.219 --> 1:00:16.438
<i>because it's Genevieve's birthday.</i>

1:00:16.482 --> 1:00:18.266
<i>Of course I'm gonna tell her
exactly, you know</i>

1:00:18.310 --> 1:00:20.181
<i>where my head's at,
you know, how I feel.</i>

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:22.662
<i>Yeah, I mean, we're here
to explore our options, right?</i>

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:26.057
I guess this is how "Paradise"
is supposed to go.

1:00:26.100 --> 1:00:27.101
Hey.

1:00:28.537 --> 1:00:31.584
- Um, can I chat with her?
- I'll-I'll go.

1:00:31.628 --> 1:00:33.847
- Don't worry, guys. One second.
- Sorry.

1:00:33.891 --> 1:00:37.329
- Hi. Happy birthday.
- Hi. Oh, thank you.

1:00:37.372 --> 1:00:39.418
<i>My biggest thing
is just being open and honest</i>

1:00:39.461 --> 1:00:40.811
and communicative, right?

1:00:40.854 --> 1:00:43.988
Like, I need that.
Relationships need that.

1:00:45.729 --> 1:00:47.382
- 'What?'
- Uh, nothing.

1:00:47.426 --> 1:00:50.255
I-I don't know what to say. Heh.

1:00:50.298 --> 1:00:52.126
- What a day!
- 'What a day.'

1:00:53.214 --> 1:00:55.086
Day two.

1:00:55.129 --> 1:00:57.697
'Feels like a month.'

1:00:57.741 --> 1:00:59.917
Yeah, I don't know, this, like

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:02.615
this just makes me
so uncomfortable.

1:01:02.659 --> 1:01:04.051
'So, like,
what are your thoughts?'

1:01:04.095 --> 1:01:08.447
How did you leave
the conversation or the date?

1:01:08.490 --> 1:01:12.016
It was like, it was, it was,
I mean, it was, it was fun. Um...

1:01:14.845 --> 1:01:17.064
So I really don't,
yeah, I don't...

1:01:18.239 --> 1:01:20.154
It's-it's-it's tough.

1:01:21.765 --> 1:01:23.505
And I know
you don't wanna hear that.

1:01:24.811 --> 1:01:26.770
What are you feeling?

1:01:26.813 --> 1:01:30.425
- 'Um, honestly?'
- Yeah.

1:01:30.469 --> 1:01:32.819
'Um, I'm checked out
after that.'

1:01:32.863 --> 1:01:36.475
You're checked out because
I don't have a decision?

1:01:36.518 --> 1:01:37.911
See, you want me to be honest

1:01:37.955 --> 1:01:40.218
and then you act like that
when I'm honest.

1:01:40.261 --> 1:01:42.133
You're essentially saying
that after spending a full day

1:01:42.176 --> 1:01:45.963
with you, and me saying "Yeah,
I have a connection with you"

1:01:46.006 --> 1:01:49.096
that, like, pack it up,
like, let's get married?

1:01:49.140 --> 1:01:51.969
Did I hope you would come back
and have a definitive answer?

1:01:52.012 --> 1:01:53.971
- Of course I did.
- Right, and I'm...

1:01:54.014 --> 1:01:55.973
'And I'm being honest with you
and telling you that I don't.'

1:01:56.016 --> 1:01:59.150
'And I-I-I can, I don't know
if I apologize for that.'

1:01:59.193 --> 1:02:02.631
- 'But, like, I..'
- I don't know what, like...

1:02:02.675 --> 1:02:04.590
I don't know
what to do from here.

1:02:04.633 --> 1:02:06.157
'I think, from what I'm hearing'

1:02:06.200 --> 1:02:08.159
'I don't think
I'm what you want.'

1:02:14.556 --> 1:02:17.864
This has been the worst day.

1:02:17.908 --> 1:02:21.041
This has been a terrible day.

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:26.351
I need something, like,
I can't just be here

1:02:26.394 --> 1:02:31.312
like, interested in only you
from the beginning.

1:02:31.356 --> 1:02:33.793
Genevieve, you were literally
the only person

1:02:33.837 --> 1:02:36.622
I talked to yesterday,
all day, all night.

1:02:36.665 --> 1:02:39.103
Do you think I was expecting

1:02:39.146 --> 1:02:41.018
someone else to come in here
and ask me on a date?

1:02:41.061 --> 1:02:43.716
You need to figure it out 'cause
you can't just do this to me

1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:45.892
or her, especially, like--

1:02:45.936 --> 1:02:47.981
What do you think I'm trying
to have these conversations for?

1:02:48.025 --> 1:02:50.854
To figure it out.
I can't just flip a coin.

1:02:50.897 --> 1:02:52.769
I need to have conversations.

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:54.683
It'd almost be better
if he came back and said

1:02:54.727 --> 1:02:56.381
"I wanna pursue Victoria"

1:02:56.424 --> 1:02:58.949
<i>not, "I wanna get to know
both of you more."</i>

1:02:58.992 --> 1:03:01.560
That's almost worse, 'cause
then he just doesn't know.

1:03:01.603 --> 1:03:03.431
I'd rather him know and me know

1:03:03.475 --> 1:03:05.390
<i>than me be waiting around
all day tomorrow</i>

1:03:05.433 --> 1:03:07.305
<i>trying to talk to him while
she's trying to talk to him</i>

1:03:07.348 --> 1:03:10.482
<i>and then sitting
at the Rose Ceremony waiting.</i>

1:03:10.525 --> 1:03:12.614
<i>And Salley will come
eventually, so this will be</i>

1:03:12.658 --> 1:03:15.356
the whole thing over again.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:17.663
Ew, heartbreaks are the worst.

1:03:17.706 --> 1:03:19.970
<i>This is
the worst birthday ever.</i>

1:03:22.886 --> 1:03:24.801
I'm gonna let you feel

1:03:24.844 --> 1:03:26.846
'everything
that you need to feel.'

1:03:45.778 --> 1:03:47.606
- Wow.
- Oh, it's kind of smooth.

1:03:49.434 --> 1:03:50.739
How are you guys?

1:03:50.783 --> 1:03:52.698
How are we, Romeo?

1:03:52.741 --> 1:03:54.221
- Just chillin'.
- Good. Yeah, we're fine.

1:03:54.265 --> 1:03:56.702
We're hoping that we can
just lay back and watch tonight

1:03:56.745 --> 1:03:58.008
rather than be
a part of everything.

1:03:58.051 --> 1:03:59.618
- Well...
- 'Right. Maybe you can.'

1:03:59.661 --> 1:04:02.099
You know? Like, last night,
I was able to sit back.

1:04:02.142 --> 1:04:05.624
- Okay, yes.
- Right. I wanna sit back.

1:04:05.667 --> 1:04:09.019
Tomorrow is the first
Rose Ceremony in Paradise

1:04:09.062 --> 1:04:10.977
<i>and the men have the roses.</i>

1:04:11.021 --> 1:04:13.675
<i>And the women are feeling
really on edge.</i>

1:04:13.719 --> 1:04:15.982
<i>But tonight
I'm happy where I'm at.</i>

1:04:16.026 --> 1:04:17.897
<i>Things are going well
between Romeo and I.</i>

1:04:17.941 --> 1:04:20.378
So I just wanna relax and, like,
talk and have quality time

1:04:20.421 --> 1:04:23.468
'cause we hadn't really had
any quality time to just talk.

1:04:23.511 --> 1:04:25.992
<i>Hopefully, this will, like,
solidify our connection.</i>

1:04:26.036 --> 1:04:28.125
We can just chill in a cabana.

1:04:28.168 --> 1:04:30.301
- Just watch.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:04:30.344 --> 1:04:31.955
You wanna do that?

1:04:31.998 --> 1:04:34.566
Get a drink, uh,
with Wells on our way.

1:04:34.609 --> 1:04:36.002
I don't really know

1:04:36.046 --> 1:04:37.961
but Kira's down there,
so I didn't really wanna--

1:04:38.004 --> 1:04:41.660
- 'Okay. Okay.'
- But you can, you can.

1:04:41.703 --> 1:04:44.315
I'm in a weird spot
because as much as I like Jill

1:04:44.358 --> 1:04:49.407
I also don't want to commit
on day two to a relationship.

1:04:59.547 --> 1:05:00.897
I'm just going up.

1:05:04.291 --> 1:05:07.991
<i>I wanna talk to Brittany and
explore a connection with her.</i>

1:05:09.514 --> 1:05:11.995
This is Paradise,
we're not here to make friends

1:05:12.038 --> 1:05:15.955
or to, like,
find a surrogate sister.

1:05:15.999 --> 1:05:18.175
<i>Point of the game
is to find love.</i>

1:05:18.218 --> 1:05:19.959
I don't know why, like,
we didn't talk the first day

1:05:20.003 --> 1:05:21.656
that much,
and I didn't wanna, like

1:05:21.700 --> 1:05:23.876
'lose my shot tonight with you.'

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:27.532
Uh, I was afraid that, like, uh

1:05:27.575 --> 1:05:29.882
if I didn't talk to you tonight

1:05:29.926 --> 1:05:32.537
then tomorrow after,
when you have the rose--

1:05:32.580 --> 1:05:34.234
But what's
your relationship like?

1:05:34.278 --> 1:05:36.106
I know, like, you and Jill
have been talking a lot.

1:05:36.149 --> 1:05:39.370
- Yeah.
- And I do respect Jill.

1:05:39.413 --> 1:05:43.243
I consider her a friend for the
amount of time I've known her.

1:05:43.287 --> 1:05:46.072
- Yeah.
- And where's that at?

1:05:46.116 --> 1:05:50.772
Yeah. Um, you know, honestly,
so nothing's a 100%.

1:05:58.041 --> 1:06:00.086
- He said to her?
- Yeah.

1:06:00.130 --> 1:06:04.482
You would think that he would,
like, put in a little effort.

1:06:04.525 --> 1:06:06.527
What the [bleep] is going on?

1:06:06.571 --> 1:06:08.921
Alright, I'll be clear.

1:06:08.965 --> 1:06:10.270
I really wanna explore
something with you.

1:06:10.314 --> 1:06:12.969
I wanna pursue something
with you.

1:06:13.012 --> 1:06:17.060
Um, but I also wanna
do this, you know

1:06:17.103 --> 1:06:21.064
without devastating Jill.

1:06:21.107 --> 1:06:24.458
Would you be open?

1:06:25.982 --> 1:06:29.028
I don't like the looks of this
at all.

1:06:29.072 --> 1:06:30.595
'Like, they know
what's going on.'

1:06:30.638 --> 1:06:31.770
Like, come on. Like, what the--

1:06:31.813 --> 1:06:33.511
Wait, Jill,
let's go somewhere else

1:06:33.554 --> 1:06:34.991
where we don't see them.

1:06:36.470 --> 1:06:37.994
Uh, this is crazy.
I'm just like...

1:06:38.037 --> 1:06:40.039
God.

1:06:44.609 --> 1:06:46.393
Hey. Oh!

1:06:46.437 --> 1:06:48.656
- I'm sorry, I-I can't.
- You-you are avoiding.

1:06:48.700 --> 1:06:50.354
I'm sorry, I-I can't. Uh...

1:06:50.397 --> 1:06:52.834
I'm not gonna...
I think, out of respect for her.

1:06:52.878 --> 1:06:54.793
I know you've already
been in, like

1:06:54.836 --> 1:06:56.795
a love triangle and everything.
Like, I--

1:06:56.838 --> 1:07:00.059
'Oh, so, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I, um..'

1:07:01.321 --> 1:07:04.629
I don't wanna go through
drama after drama.

1:07:04.672 --> 1:07:08.415
Clear out your thoughts and
just really think about this.

1:07:08.459 --> 1:07:12.637
Brittany said that she was
interested in exploring with me

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:15.118
but she wanted me
to talk to Jill first.

1:07:15.161 --> 1:07:16.684
Even though she shot me down
in the sense

1:07:16.728 --> 1:07:18.208
that she swerved my kiss...

1:07:18.251 --> 1:07:21.820
Hey.. Oh...

1:07:21.863 --> 1:07:24.475
I could tell she is interested.

1:07:24.518 --> 1:07:26.477
I got pulled by Romeo.

1:07:26.520 --> 1:07:29.828
It was
the most awkward conversation

1:07:29.871 --> 1:07:31.917
I've ever had.

1:07:31.960 --> 1:07:35.399
He went in for a kiss,
and it turned me off.

1:07:35.442 --> 1:07:38.402
<i>Romeo is just
not my type of guy.</i>

1:07:38.445 --> 1:07:40.665
If he were to give me a rose,
I would tell him

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:42.493
I would rather get hit by a bus.

1:07:45.061 --> 1:07:46.975
'I mean, he just pulled me
to have a conversation.'

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:48.368
Yeah, I don't know why
because he hasn't talked to me

1:07:48.412 --> 1:07:50.022
all day. And I've been asking
for quality--

1:07:50.066 --> 1:07:51.458
I mean, the entire time, I mean

1:07:51.502 --> 1:07:53.156
I told him to talk to you
about it.

1:07:53.199 --> 1:07:55.027
I was just like, "I have
so much respect for her."

1:07:55.071 --> 1:07:58.117
Like, what the [bleep]?
No. It's like--

1:07:58.161 --> 1:07:59.945
I honestly would have
that conversation with him.

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:03.122
All of a sudden Brittany tells
me that Romeo was like

1:08:03.166 --> 1:08:05.255
<i>"Yeah, I wanna pursue
something with you."</i>

1:08:05.298 --> 1:08:07.126
Oh, my God, at the 11th hour

1:08:07.170 --> 1:08:11.522
he decides he wants to explore
this relationship.

1:08:11.565 --> 1:08:13.915
<i>Usually,
people who get a second chance</i>

1:08:13.959 --> 1:08:15.265
<i>do something with it.</i>

1:08:15.308 --> 1:08:19.182
Bro, at least have
a little bit of respect for me.

1:08:19.225 --> 1:08:20.661
I don't really wanna
talk to you right now.

1:08:20.705 --> 1:08:23.011
I really don't wanna
talk to you at all.

1:08:23.055 --> 1:08:26.014
Uh, sure.
Can we just talk to the...

1:08:26.058 --> 1:08:27.190
Go to those pool cubes
over there?

1:08:27.233 --> 1:08:28.408
Fine.

1:08:32.369 --> 1:08:34.458
- 'What was that?'
- 'Um..'

1:08:36.024 --> 1:08:37.722
No, I...

1:08:37.765 --> 1:08:39.376
Alright, here we go. Go ahead.

1:08:41.247 --> 1:08:43.380
Pulled you aside
because I wanna let you know

1:08:43.423 --> 1:08:47.123
that this is Paradise and, uh,
we're here to explore--

1:08:47.166 --> 1:08:50.300
Oh, my God,
you're just gonna let...

1:08:50.343 --> 1:08:52.780
- No, Jill, Jill.
- Like, I'm so done with you.

1:08:52.824 --> 1:08:55.609
Wait, Jill.

1:08:55.653 --> 1:08:57.350
I don't wanna speak to you.

1:08:57.394 --> 1:08:59.744
- I don't wanna talk to you.
- Jill.

1:08:59.787 --> 1:09:02.703
Whatever you're doing, like,
I don't want a part of it.

1:09:02.747 --> 1:09:06.229
No, like, go. Bye. Bye!

1:09:06.272 --> 1:09:08.753
- I've already wasted my time.
- You're not going home.

1:09:08.796 --> 1:09:10.668
I know what you're doing.
I know what you're doing.

1:09:10.711 --> 1:09:12.757
It's scaring me. Go away. Like...

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:14.237
Jill.

1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:16.761
No! I told you what I needed.

1:09:18.241 --> 1:09:19.938
Romeo, you're playing a game!

1:09:19.981 --> 1:09:22.027
Like, I don't wanna play games
with you. It's so stupid.

1:09:22.070 --> 1:09:25.813
Like, go ahead. Be with
Brittany. I'll be with whoever.

1:09:25.857 --> 1:09:27.554
I really don't care. Good luck.

1:09:27.598 --> 1:09:30.470
- I'm gonna walk away now.
- 'Yeah, love that.'

1:09:30.514 --> 1:09:34.387
Go. You said you were gonna
walk away. Bye. Have fun.

1:09:54.886 --> 1:09:56.235
Hey, hey, hey. What's going on?

1:09:56.279 --> 1:09:57.628
- I'm sick of being embarrassed.
- Wait. No.

1:09:57.671 --> 1:10:00.152
- 'Can you just talk to me?'
- 'No, no, no.'

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:03.242
Just for one second,
like, what's going on?

1:10:03.286 --> 1:10:05.766
I shouldn't have
trusted him again.

1:10:05.810 --> 1:10:08.247
I could have been spending time
getting to know people

1:10:08.291 --> 1:10:10.597
that actually care about me.

1:10:10.641 --> 1:10:13.470
Look at him. He's looking like
he's downtrodden and distraught.

1:10:13.513 --> 1:10:15.211
'Now he's like,
oh, he looks like'

1:10:15.254 --> 1:10:17.648
he looks like he's in agony.

1:10:17.691 --> 1:10:20.520
Did you even let him,
like, finish his sentence

1:10:20.564 --> 1:10:22.479
or were you like, "No,
I'm not listening to this"?

1:10:22.522 --> 1:10:23.958
I don't care, you just made me

1:10:24.002 --> 1:10:26.178
look like an idiot
for three days.

1:10:26.222 --> 1:10:28.180
You did this!
Like, what were you...

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.443
What, did you expect me
to sit there and be like

1:10:30.487 --> 1:10:33.620
"Okay, yeah, I'll let you
walk all over me?"

1:10:33.664 --> 1:10:35.579
I'm not going to let boys

1:10:35.622 --> 1:10:38.364
<i>make me feel like garbage anymore.</i>

1:10:46.198 --> 1:10:48.287
Oh, my gosh,
we got another puppy.

1:10:48.331 --> 1:10:52.335
- This one is so much cuter.
- Oh, my goodness.

1:10:52.378 --> 1:10:54.511
All I wanted to do was,
like, spend time with Romeo

1:10:54.554 --> 1:10:56.339
<i>all yesterday,
and then he was like</i>

1:10:56.382 --> 1:10:59.733
<i>"Hey, Jill, nothing
in Paradise is guaranteed."</i>

1:10:59.777 --> 1:11:01.300
And then he, like, chased me
around and was, like

1:11:01.344 --> 1:11:03.389
pretending he was upset.
But I'm like, "Really?"

1:11:03.433 --> 1:11:05.478
I know, I heard about him, like,
running after you

1:11:05.522 --> 1:11:07.437
very dramatically. I was like...

1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:09.308
Yeah, like, literally
get away from me, like

1:11:09.352 --> 1:11:11.441
I am not gonna let you
speak another word to me

1:11:11.484 --> 1:11:14.531
'cause I've wasted so much
time and energy on you.

1:11:14.574 --> 1:11:16.794
Oh, I might be going somewhere

1:11:16.837 --> 1:11:20.145
'cause I'm probably
not gonna get a rose tonight.

1:11:20.188 --> 1:11:22.190
Romeo completely
doesn't respect me

1:11:22.234 --> 1:11:23.888
<i>or care about me at all.</i>

1:11:26.499 --> 1:11:29.415
<i>Like, not even, like,
basic human decency.</i>

1:11:29.459 --> 1:11:31.548
<i>Basic human decency.</i>

1:11:31.591 --> 1:11:34.942
I've been bamboozled.

1:11:34.986 --> 1:11:36.596
I feel bamboozled.

1:11:38.729 --> 1:11:41.558
<i>The only thing I wanna do
is look so hot</i>

1:11:41.601 --> 1:11:46.214
at the Rose Ceremony tonight
and say, "[bleep] you

1:11:46.258 --> 1:11:48.304
because [bleep] you big-time."

1:11:55.485 --> 1:11:57.400
Are you excited or nervous
about tonight?

1:11:57.443 --> 1:11:59.750
I don't have, like,
the secure relationship.

1:11:59.793 --> 1:12:02.927
I agree. Honestly, I'm trying
to think of the positives.

1:12:02.970 --> 1:12:05.146
Tonight
is the first Rose Ceremony.

1:12:05.190 --> 1:12:08.846
<i>There are twelve girls
and nine guys.</i>

1:12:08.889 --> 1:12:10.108
Guys have the roses this week

1:12:10.151 --> 1:12:11.762
so we're all scrambling
right now.

1:12:11.805 --> 1:12:14.199
I mean, some of us
have the roses secure.

1:12:14.242 --> 1:12:18.072
But people like me, I don't know
what's gonna happen tonight.

1:12:18.116 --> 1:12:21.293
For once I can feel confident
in this Rose Ceremony.

1:12:21.337 --> 1:12:22.512
- 'And it feels good.'
- I think you should.

1:12:22.555 --> 1:12:24.252
- Yeah. That's awesome.
- Yeah.

1:12:24.296 --> 1:12:26.559
I'm optimistic, but I'm nervous

1:12:26.603 --> 1:12:28.996
just like everyone else, so...

1:12:29.040 --> 1:12:32.391
Going into tonight,
the men will give the roses out

1:12:32.435 --> 1:12:34.437
and the three women
that don't get a rose

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:37.309
obviously,
we will be sent home.

1:12:37.353 --> 1:12:39.485
Alright. Why am I nervous?

1:12:39.529 --> 1:12:42.532
Ah, I would be terrified
if I was you.

1:12:42.575 --> 1:12:44.925
<i>I put all my eggs
in one basket with Justin</i>

1:12:44.969 --> 1:12:48.189
and now everything's
just so up in the air.

1:12:48.233 --> 1:12:49.626
It's just a roller-coaster,
I feel like.

1:12:49.669 --> 1:12:51.410
- It's scary.
- Yeah.

1:12:51.454 --> 1:12:52.629
What's up, ladies?

1:12:52.672 --> 1:12:54.152
<i>But I feel
like a lot of women are</i>

1:12:54.195 --> 1:12:55.545
nervous for tonight,
there's only

1:12:55.588 --> 1:12:57.416
a few, like, solid couples.

1:12:57.460 --> 1:12:59.810
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ooh, you look nice.

1:12:59.853 --> 1:13:01.246
Thank you.

1:13:01.289 --> 1:13:04.945
Everyone else is just nervous.

1:13:04.989 --> 1:13:06.338
- 'Jess.'
- 'Jesse.'

1:13:06.382 --> 1:13:08.775
- Jesse Palmer.
- 'Hey, everyone.'

1:13:08.819 --> 1:13:10.298
'Well, judging
by some of the smiles'

1:13:10.342 --> 1:13:11.865
I see around the room,
I can tell that Paradise

1:13:11.909 --> 1:13:14.520
is already starting to work
for some of you.

1:13:14.564 --> 1:13:17.610
Lace, obviously, three women
are gonna be going home tonight.

1:13:17.654 --> 1:13:19.873
How does that make you feel?

1:13:19.917 --> 1:13:22.267
Um, I mean, we all wanna be here

1:13:22.310 --> 1:13:24.008
so it is a little nerve-racking
and scary.

1:13:24.051 --> 1:13:25.575
We-we wanna make connections.

1:13:25.618 --> 1:13:28.926
- Um, yeah, it's scary.
- 'Alright.'

1:13:28.969 --> 1:13:30.493
Shanae, has Paradise been

1:13:30.536 --> 1:13:31.842
everything you hoped
it would be?

1:13:31.885 --> 1:13:33.626
- It's been great.
- 'So already..'

1:13:33.670 --> 1:13:35.367
'This is a totally
different experience'

1:13:35.411 --> 1:13:36.673
'for you
than on Clayton's season.'

1:13:36.716 --> 1:13:38.370
Very different experience.

1:13:38.414 --> 1:13:39.676
'That's amazing.
That's awesome.'

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:42.635
- Yeah.
- Romeo, oh, Romeo.

1:13:42.679 --> 1:13:45.029
- We finding love, brother?
- 'Oh, my God.'

1:13:47.510 --> 1:13:49.207
Why's everybody laughing?

1:13:49.250 --> 1:13:50.774
'It's been a difficult week.'

1:13:50.817 --> 1:13:54.691
Um, tonight's the night
for, for a lot

1:13:54.734 --> 1:13:57.781
of, uh, honest conversations

1:13:57.824 --> 1:14:01.959
and, um,
and some difficult ones, too.

1:14:03.526 --> 1:14:05.702
It's a long night.
Anything could happen.

1:14:05.745 --> 1:14:09.662
And, Kira, how are you feeling
about Paradise so far?

1:14:09.706 --> 1:14:14.537
Um, I think the first day
was definitely very difficult.

1:14:14.580 --> 1:14:16.974
'Uh, thank you, Romeo. Um..'

1:14:17.017 --> 1:14:19.542
Romeo, is that what you were
talking about earlier?

1:14:19.585 --> 1:14:23.502
Uh, that's one of
several things. Yes.

1:14:23.546 --> 1:14:27.506
Romeo's old news now. Um, I've
moved on to greener pastures.

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:30.640
And I'm great
where I'm at today.

1:14:33.077 --> 1:14:36.776
On that note, with tonight's
Rose Ceremony looming

1:14:36.820 --> 1:14:39.083
'the unfortunate reality is,
is that some of you'

1:14:39.126 --> 1:14:41.999
'will be leaving here tonight
brokenhearted.'

1:14:42.042 --> 1:14:46.525
'But no matter what, do not
give up on love, alright?'

1:14:46.569 --> 1:14:48.745
'Next time I see you,
we'll be at the Rose Ceremony.'

1:14:48.788 --> 1:14:52.400
I wish you all luck.
Will see ya.

1:14:52.444 --> 1:14:54.228
I came in hot,
I came into the beach

1:14:54.272 --> 1:14:57.536
<i>with a love triangle
between Kira and Jill</i>

1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:00.321
<i>and then
tried to kiss Brittany.</i>

1:15:00.365 --> 1:15:02.498
I made a big mess.

1:15:02.541 --> 1:15:05.936
<i>Jill hates me
because she feels like</i>

1:15:05.979 --> 1:15:09.113
I have not been communicating
with her well

1:15:09.156 --> 1:15:13.378
about the other connections
that I'm exploring.

1:15:13.421 --> 1:15:15.467
<i>It's clear what I need to do.</i>

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:19.253
<i>I need to make things right
with Jill.</i>

1:15:19.297 --> 1:15:22.343
<i>I can give her a rose, then..</i>

1:15:24.302 --> 1:15:27.000
I feel like part of the mess
has been cleaned up.

1:15:30.656 --> 1:15:33.137
- 'How was your day today?'
- Pretty rough, honestly.

1:15:33.180 --> 1:15:34.747
It started, like, pretty rough.

1:15:34.791 --> 1:15:37.750
Um, I just feel like
I, I feel really

1:15:37.794 --> 1:15:40.623
like, hurt and, like,
bamboozled by Romeo

1:15:40.666 --> 1:15:42.973
'because I gave him,
like, a second chance.'

1:15:43.016 --> 1:15:45.323
'Yeah, that's where
I start to, like, fall off'

1:15:45.366 --> 1:15:47.586
'cause I'm like, "The guy
kind of showed his hand."

1:15:47.630 --> 1:15:50.807
It-it for sure is, like, coming
back to bite me in the ass

1:15:50.850 --> 1:15:55.812
for trusting him again for
defending him for X, Y and Z.

1:15:55.855 --> 1:15:58.945
Forget the past. What's-what's
the future for you?

1:15:59.946 --> 1:16:01.426
I don't know.

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:02.906
Give me best-case scenario.

1:16:02.949 --> 1:16:04.516
- 'Best-case scenario?'
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:07.345
A genie just popped out
of the lamp

1:16:07.388 --> 1:16:09.521
and he's giving you
all the wishes.

1:16:09.565 --> 1:16:11.088
- 'By some miracle?'
- Casey.

1:16:11.131 --> 1:16:14.178
Can I, uh,
can I steal Jill for a sec?

1:16:14.221 --> 1:16:15.571
It's up to Jill.

1:16:17.094 --> 1:16:18.835
Yeah, it's fine.

1:16:18.878 --> 1:16:20.576
- Alright.
- Great talk.

1:16:20.619 --> 1:16:21.881
- 'Good talk.'
- Mwah.

1:16:21.925 --> 1:16:24.144
Mwah. I'll check in
with you later, dude.

1:16:24.188 --> 1:16:25.581
Yeah.

1:16:28.148 --> 1:16:31.848
I don't particularly
wanna talk to you anyways.

1:16:31.891 --> 1:16:35.286
I don't feel like you deserve
to say anything to me.

1:16:36.461 --> 1:16:38.550
I'm so hurt by you.

1:16:38.594 --> 1:16:42.467
I did not choose to hurt you.

1:16:42.510 --> 1:16:43.729
You did choose to hurt me.

1:16:43.773 --> 1:16:48.647
You made a series of decisions
that hurt me.

1:16:48.691 --> 1:16:51.868
I'm sorry, but, like,
I'm kind of a great person.

1:16:51.911 --> 1:16:55.785
- You are, Jill.
- And you [bleep] know that.

1:16:55.828 --> 1:16:58.657
Damn, Romeo looks like
he's going through it, bro.

1:16:58.701 --> 1:17:02.008
- I mean, we're on day three.
- 'Day three!'

1:17:02.052 --> 1:17:04.968
Whatever equation
Romeo has to come up with

1:17:05.011 --> 1:17:08.232
<i>in order to solve this massive
long-division problem</i>

1:17:08.275 --> 1:17:11.017
<i>he's created is beyond me.</i>

1:17:11.061 --> 1:17:13.629
<i>It's kinda like watching
a car wreck.</i>

1:17:13.672 --> 1:17:16.414
I mean,
you just can't look away.

1:17:16.457 --> 1:17:18.938
Just, it's just a burning mess.

1:17:18.982 --> 1:17:21.375
How could you not think
that would hurt me?

1:17:21.419 --> 1:17:25.205
Dude, I, uh, I'm-I'm feeling
for the guy a little bit.

1:17:25.249 --> 1:17:26.685
- 'Huh?'
- I feel for him a little bit.

1:17:26.729 --> 1:17:29.253
- I do, bro. That's tough.
- Yeah.

1:17:29.296 --> 1:17:31.603
In the 11th hour of last night

1:17:31.647 --> 1:17:34.606
you're like,
"I'm gonna pursue Brittany."

1:17:34.650 --> 1:17:37.609
And then you did it
right in front of my face.

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:39.089
- It was a mistake. I-I'm not--
- Like...

1:17:39.132 --> 1:17:41.526
That is so insidious.

1:17:41.569 --> 1:17:43.833
- Romeo.
- I don't know. I just--

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:45.835
Like, you have to be, like, real
with me, like, please, like...

1:17:45.878 --> 1:17:48.359
I honestly don't know.
I wanted to talk to Brittany.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:49.752
And I was afraid to talk to you.

1:17:49.795 --> 1:17:52.798
I just expected
basic human decency from you.

1:17:52.842 --> 1:17:54.713
I-I...

1:18:03.287 --> 1:18:06.943
If I still give you

1:18:06.986 --> 1:18:08.814
a rose

1:18:08.858 --> 1:18:13.689
do you think maybe
you would accept it and stay on?

1:18:13.732 --> 1:18:15.255
Explore other options
because, like

1:18:15.299 --> 1:18:18.911
this door is, like, firmly shut.

1:18:18.955 --> 1:18:23.699
And I can't trust
anything you say.

1:18:26.484 --> 1:18:29.705
There's no more chances left.

1:18:29.748 --> 1:18:32.577
I hope that you figure it out.

1:18:32.620 --> 1:18:33.839
- Um...
- 'Yeah.'

1:18:35.014 --> 1:18:36.233
Thank you, Jill.

1:18:45.503 --> 1:18:47.810
'From what I understand,
you're supposed to come here'

1:18:47.853 --> 1:18:49.812
'and try to make connections
with as many people as you'

1:18:49.855 --> 1:18:52.858
possibly can and then figure out
who you are

1:18:52.902 --> 1:18:54.817
have the best connection with.

1:18:54.860 --> 1:19:00.170
And it looks like that his
connection with Jill is gone.

1:19:00.213 --> 1:19:03.173
Men are usually confronted
with a good-decision

1:19:03.216 --> 1:19:07.090
and a bad-decision button here
in Paradise and they can choose.

1:19:07.133 --> 1:19:09.701
Apparently, Romeo can only see
the bad-decision button

1:19:09.745 --> 1:19:12.922
and he just keeps on
hitting that constantly.

1:19:12.965 --> 1:19:17.317
Hi. You-you're-you're
such a joy of sunshine.

1:19:17.361 --> 1:19:19.624
I wasn't expecting you.

1:19:19.667 --> 1:19:21.191
- Oh, my God.
- It'll be okay.

1:19:21.234 --> 1:19:22.540
It's awesome right here.

1:19:22.583 --> 1:19:24.934
- Oh, my God, it's awesome here.
- Yeah.

1:19:24.977 --> 1:19:26.196
I don't even know
if he knows that

1:19:26.239 --> 1:19:28.807
there's a good-decision
button over here.

1:19:28.851 --> 1:19:31.810
I-I really, I have
a good feeling about you.

1:19:31.854 --> 1:19:33.333
- About me?
- Yeah, yeah.

1:19:33.377 --> 1:19:36.510
No, sorry.

1:19:36.554 --> 1:19:39.862
Watching Romeo operate
really makes me question

1:19:39.905 --> 1:19:41.864
<i>whether or not
he went to Harvard.</i>

1:19:41.907 --> 1:19:44.649
Everybody is trying to get down
to, like, one or two women.

1:19:44.692 --> 1:19:48.522
Romeo has cast a [bleep] net.

1:19:48.566 --> 1:19:51.438
Wait, hold on, I think
Casey's talking to Kira.

1:19:51.482 --> 1:19:53.005
Oh. Oh, no, Romeo is. Romeo is.

1:19:53.049 --> 1:19:54.964
- Oh, that's Romeo? Wait.
- 'Romeo?'

1:19:55.007 --> 1:19:58.010
- Ooh, scary.
- 'To be honest..'

1:19:58.054 --> 1:20:01.840
After the way
things have kinda turned out

1:20:01.884 --> 1:20:04.060
with Jill now, I, like...

1:20:07.411 --> 1:20:11.850
I kind of regret
being close-minded so early on.

1:20:11.894 --> 1:20:16.594
I wanna salvage, uh, any spark

1:20:16.637 --> 1:20:18.639
uh, that there may have been...

1:20:20.380 --> 1:20:22.818
...possibly between us. Um...

1:20:25.081 --> 1:20:28.127
I have a hard time trusting you
right now, Romeo, honestly.

1:20:28.171 --> 1:20:30.869
I don't appreciate
how you treated me.

1:20:30.913 --> 1:20:33.829
And I'm not gonna be, like,
quick to forgive.

1:20:33.872 --> 1:20:36.005
But, um...

1:20:37.528 --> 1:20:39.312
If I gave you a rose, would

1:20:39.356 --> 1:20:41.401
do you think you would accept?

1:20:41.445 --> 1:20:43.099
You've just been making
a lot of, like

1:20:43.142 --> 1:20:46.015
very, like, rash decisions
since you've been here.

1:20:46.058 --> 1:20:48.713
- Mm. Yeah.
- And they make no sense.

1:20:48.756 --> 1:20:50.671
So I don't have an answer
for you.

1:20:57.417 --> 1:20:59.985
Are you okay? No, stop.

1:21:01.639 --> 1:21:04.772
What's going on?
What's going on?

1:21:04.816 --> 1:21:08.124
- I'm really sorry.
- Hm?

1:21:09.212 --> 1:21:10.430
What's going on?

1:21:10.474 --> 1:21:12.824
Just I'm so-so sorry
for the way I treated you.

1:21:12.868 --> 1:21:15.000
It's okay. What's going on?

1:21:19.004 --> 1:21:21.311
I don't know what's gonna
happen with Romeo

1:21:21.354 --> 1:21:24.792
<i>but, uh, his chickens
are coming home to roost.</i>

1:21:24.836 --> 1:21:26.490
After seeing how he's acting now

1:21:26.533 --> 1:21:29.667
he's kind of like given himself
a scarlet letter.

1:21:29.710 --> 1:21:32.670
- No, no.
- I-I wanna know the scene.

1:21:32.713 --> 1:21:35.978
- Uh...
- Are you, like, doing okay?

1:21:36.021 --> 1:21:40.460
No. I, uh, I've damaged
some friendships.

1:21:40.504 --> 1:21:42.636
- 'So..'
- That's hard.

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:46.902
How many more girls is Romeo
gonna mess with this season?

1:21:46.945 --> 1:21:49.426
<i>Maybe, like, five more?</i>

1:21:49.469 --> 1:21:52.124
<i>We may not know
who Romeo's giving his rose to</i>

1:21:52.168 --> 1:21:53.865
<i>but we also don't know if</i>

1:21:53.909 --> 1:21:57.173
<i>any of the ladies
would accept his rose.</i>

1:21:57.216 --> 1:22:00.219
Romeo
is a damn dead man walking.

1:22:00.263 --> 1:22:01.264
Oh, God.

1:22:05.616 --> 1:22:08.445
- 'Calm down.'
- Oh, no.

1:22:11.143 --> 1:22:12.579
Tomorrow night on

1:22:12.623 --> 1:22:14.712
<i>"Bachelor In Paradise.."</i>

1:22:14.755 --> 1:22:16.148
Three girls are going home.

1:22:16.192 --> 1:22:18.150
<i>I'm totally confident I will be</i>

1:22:18.194 --> 1:22:19.717
receiving a rose from Johnny.

1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:21.414
Have you kissed anyone
in Paradise yet?

1:22:21.458 --> 1:22:22.676
I have not.

1:22:22.720 --> 1:22:23.721
I think Victoria's here

1:22:23.764 --> 1:22:25.157
<i>to stir the pot.</i>

1:22:26.985 --> 1:22:28.726
It's been such a [bleep] show
out there.

1:22:28.769 --> 1:22:31.033
<i>Yeah, everything is just,
like, falling apart.</i>

1:22:31.076 --> 1:22:33.470
I just feel so bad.

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.821
I really botched that, dude.

1:22:36.864 --> 1:22:38.344
- 'Who is that?'
- 'Rodney!'

1:22:39.519 --> 1:22:41.608
I have not heard a single girl

1:22:41.652 --> 1:22:43.784
<i>here say that they're not
interested in Rodney.</i>

1:22:43.828 --> 1:22:45.525
- Hi.
- Oh, you look good.

1:22:45.569 --> 1:22:49.268
Well, well, well, are the tides
turning in Paradise?

1:22:49.312 --> 1:22:52.010
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, Lord.

1:22:52.054 --> 1:22:54.012
What's up, ladies?

1:22:54.056 --> 1:22:56.667
- Oh, my God.
- What's up, guys?

1:22:56.710 --> 1:22:58.799
James and Aaron are hot.

1:22:58.843 --> 1:23:00.279
It is a double date card.

1:23:00.323 --> 1:23:02.673
I wanna go on a date with Aaron.
That would be sexy.

1:23:02.716 --> 1:23:04.849
Genevieve, would you like to go
on this date with me?

1:23:04.892 --> 1:23:07.243
- Yes, I would.
- 'Ooh.'

1:23:07.286 --> 1:23:09.419
Shanae, wanna go on this date?

1:23:09.462 --> 1:23:12.204
- 'Yes, absolutely.'
- 'This is gonna be spicy.'

1:23:12.248 --> 1:23:14.859
My God, this is so cursed.

1:23:14.902 --> 1:23:17.688
The two-on-one enemies are
going on a double date today.

1:23:17.731 --> 1:23:20.343
Shanae is trying to start
drama. It's not right.

1:23:20.386 --> 1:23:22.171
It is very hard to juggle
two men at once.

1:23:22.214 --> 1:23:24.521
<i>I've never done that before.
I'm not holding back.</i>

1:23:24.564 --> 1:23:27.132
I don't care who's around.
Like, I'm being Shanae.

1:23:27.176 --> 1:23:31.658
What the [bleep]?
This should not have happened.

1:23:36.663 --> 1:23:38.274
Salley here?

1:23:47.544 --> 1:23:50.460
Yeah.

1:23:51.852 --> 1:23:53.463
It's gonna be okay.

1:24:04.822 --> 1:24:06.693
I'm gonna lose my job!

1:24:06.737 --> 1:24:09.522
Sorry, but I have to stay and
I have to stay here with him.

1:24:09.566 --> 1:24:12.525
- He doesn't love you!
- I think he loves me.

1:24:12.569 --> 1:24:16.834
- I don't think he does!
- No! No, no, not doing it!

1:24:16.877 --> 1:24:20.533
No! I'm staying! I love him!

1:24:24.581 --> 1:24:27.279
Cry, cry, cry!

1:24:27.323 --> 1:24:28.324
We gotta go.
