WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:03.100
<i>Gott im Himmel!</i>

00:03.465 --> 00:06.478
I knew it. Those damn cannibals
have taken Schmidt!

00:06.546 --> 00:08.970
See?
Look there, a blood trail!

00:09.038 --> 00:10.268
<i>- Das ist blud.
- Armer Schmidt.</i>

00:10.335 --> 00:12.243
So let's follow it
<i>und</i> kill those savages!

00:12.311 --> 00:14.854
Are you quite insane?

00:14.922 --> 00:16.588
There could be
scores of them,

00:16.656 --> 00:17.757
hundreds, even!

00:17.825 --> 00:19.525
<i>Ja,</i> with sticks
<i>und</i> stones.

00:19.593 --> 00:21.893
<i>Ja,</i> and maybe
poison arrows!

00:21.961 --> 00:23.299
<i>- Schweinhunden!
- Mein Gott!</i>

00:23.421 --> 00:25.563
We need reinforcements.
Schneider!

00:25.847 --> 00:28.489
Luckily, there is a
<i>Kriegsmarine</i> transport nearb,

00:28.557 --> 00:29.658
heading for Nauru.

00:29.835 --> 00:31.674
<i>Hallo? Hallo!</i>

00:31.772 --> 00:33.723
<i>Agent Fucs
der Abwehr hie.</i>

00:33.881 --> 00:36.377
<i>Ich muss mit deinm
Kapitaen spreche.</i>

00:36.445 --> 00:38.511
With a bit of luck,
soon we will have

00:38.579 --> 00:41.486
a platoon of marine
<i>Sturmtruppen.</i>

00:42.564 --> 00:43.666
<i>Sturmtruppe?</i>

00:43.734 --> 00:44.775
Damn it!

00:44.843 --> 00:46.814
Wait,
what are <i> Sturmtruppen?</i>

00:46.882 --> 00:48.314
It means
stormtroopers.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.698
- Aw, crap.
- Yeah, that doesn't sound good.

00:50.766 --> 00:52.431
- Well, it is a cognate.
- What?

00:52.499 --> 00:55.433
Cognate. Those are words with
a common etymological origin.

00:55.516 --> 00:56.869
Not the word, Poindexter,

00:56.937 --> 00:58.354
the fact that there's a thing
called that.

00:58.421 --> 01:00.189
Yeah, and how many guys
in a platoon?

01:00.257 --> 01:02.403
- Like, 40!
- Wait, were you in the army?

01:02.471 --> 01:04.241
- Army Air Corps.
- Hmm.

01:04.309 --> 01:05.865
Well, that doesn't
do us much good.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.608
Hey, neither does
your missing arm.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.272
- Hey!
- But if my almost

01:09.340 --> 01:10.960
totally nonexistent
understanding

01:11.028 --> 01:12.186
of military history
is correct...

01:12.253 --> 01:13.803
- Why would...
- Noah, shut up.

01:13.871 --> 01:16.526
Then I'm pretty sure we can
expect several waves of attacks,

01:16.594 --> 01:18.708
wherein the attackers
will steadily increase

01:18.776 --> 01:20.412
in both number and in skill

01:20.480 --> 01:23.225
until we face a final,
climactic attack

01:23.293 --> 01:27.461
by a sort of ueber-attacker,
a boss, if you will.

01:28.143 --> 01:29.796
- Translate that.
- Uh,

01:29.998 --> 01:33.022
<i>boroka handiak,</i>
<i>boroka</i> "boss"

01:33.090 --> 01:33.998
Mm.

01:34.066 --> 01:35.820
Wait,
was that it, or...

01:35.888 --> 01:38.191
- Broad strokes.
- Huh. Well, now tell him

01:38.259 --> 01:39.668
we need to build
a network of defenses

01:39.735 --> 01:40.863
out of whatever's on hand

01:40.931 --> 01:43.381
while also training everybody...
The men, the women,

01:43.449 --> 01:46.879
these nubile teenage girls
I really hope are at least 18,

01:46.947 --> 01:48.866
maybe some
of the chubbier kids,

01:48.934 --> 01:51.972
I mean everybody, all of them...
To fight.

01:52.052 --> 01:53.465
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
<i>Zuri gotiak boroka.</i>

01:53.533 --> 01:55.894
<i>Boroka dugu.
Zenbat ordo?</i>

01:55.962 --> 01:57.832
Um, uh,
so they're eager to fight,

01:57.900 --> 01:59.418
and how much time
do we have?

01:59.486 --> 02:01.519
- Just a couple hours!
- Seriously?

02:01.587 --> 02:03.388
Yeah, so obviously,
we're gonna have

02:03.456 --> 02:05.757
to montage the shit
out of this thing.

02:09.500 --> 02:11.268
Will you tell him
what a montage is?

02:11.336 --> 02:13.724
Yeah, I don't think
"montage" would translate.

02:13.792 --> 02:16.925
They... they don't really have
a strong filmic tradition.

02:17.024 --> 02:18.636
And whose fault
is that, Noah?

02:18.704 --> 02:21.985
- Well, I mean...
- Jesus, you are the fucking worst.

03:00.618 --> 03:03.251
Yeah. So, lf we've firmed up that training
and preparation

03:03.319 --> 03:05.290
and then sort of cut it down
to just the good parts

03:05.357 --> 03:07.417
and set that
to some bouncy music,

03:07.485 --> 03:09.509
that would've been a montage.

03:10.227 --> 03:12.162
I honestly wouldn't
even know where to start.

03:12.230 --> 03:14.441
Try Eisenstein,
you asshole!

03:14.509 --> 03:15.814
All right,
let's see what we got!

03:15.882 --> 03:17.634
<i>Kusta dugu!</i>

03:21.461 --> 03:23.179
Um, okay!

03:23.247 --> 03:24.179
Good job, I guess!

03:24.260 --> 03:25.477
<i>Ona gudari!</i>

03:27.215 --> 03:29.407
Good-looking tiger trap, ladies!

03:29.475 --> 03:30.482
<i>Ona trampak!</i>

03:30.550 --> 03:32.722
Don't forget to smear
those stakes with feces!

03:32.790 --> 03:34.560
Poo-poo! Poo-poo!

03:34.628 --> 03:35.704
Oh, come on.

03:35.787 --> 03:37.545
- What?
- Hat's what they call it.

03:38.984 --> 03:41.426
Oh, man. Thanks, tribal elders!

03:41.494 --> 03:42.732
<i>Ona zahara!</i>

03:42.842 --> 03:45.920
Uh-oh, what are
Nazi Laurel and Hardy up to?

03:46.071 --> 03:48.303
Wow, literally
another fine mess.

03:48.383 --> 03:50.756
Hmm, that's not
gonna translate.

03:50.824 --> 03:52.307
I mean, A, it's sarcasm,

03:52.389 --> 03:54.275
B, they're not gonna
get the reference, and...

03:54.343 --> 03:56.150
And C, shut up and...

03:56.218 --> 03:59.729
Oh, my God, what's that big,
crazy man-killing bastard?

03:59.877 --> 04:01.707
Let's call it
the widowmaker!

04:01.775 --> 04:03.575
Well, that's also
not gonna translate.

04:03.643 --> 04:05.254
Noah, God damn it,
if you don't...

04:05.369 --> 04:07.752
Wait, where's
my Chub Club?

04:08.470 --> 04:10.852
Yeah, there they are!

04:11.986 --> 04:13.289
Um...

04:13.359 --> 04:14.358
that's okay.

04:14.426 --> 04:15.892
Uh, shake it off

04:15.960 --> 04:17.832
and get some more
poison darts from Pam.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.064
<i>Pozo Pamu!</i>

04:19.132 --> 04:20.331
Aw, come on.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.791
This bullshit
is boring as balls.

04:23.054 --> 04:24.267
Huh.

04:28.143 --> 04:31.439
I wish to amend
my previous statement.

04:31.526 --> 04:33.252
Okay.
All right, all right.

04:33.329 --> 04:35.395
So, um, criticisms.

04:35.508 --> 04:37.503
I think we maybe could've
spent a little more time

04:37.571 --> 04:38.993
practicing actual combat

04:39.061 --> 04:41.542
and a little less
making the Nazi logs,

04:41.610 --> 04:44.516
but overall,
great job, everybody!

04:44.860 --> 04:46.829
<i>Ona lanara!</i>

04:47.728 --> 04:49.141
Okay, Noah,
tell the chief

04:49.209 --> 04:50.767
the most important thing
to remember is...

04:50.834 --> 04:52.877
- Sterling?
- Wh...

04:53.705 --> 04:54.787
Mother?

04:54.855 --> 04:56.662
What in the hell
are you wearing?

04:56.769 --> 04:58.004
I-I mean...

04:58.072 --> 04:59.437
Master Coconut!

04:59.505 --> 05:01.687
Pam, shut up.
What are you doing here?

05:01.762 --> 05:03.270
Well, we came to rescue...

05:03.343 --> 05:04.909
The sacred idol!

05:04.977 --> 05:05.584
- What?
- Nuh-uh!

05:05.652 --> 05:07.232
God damn it!

05:07.300 --> 05:09.402
We're searching
for the sacred idol!

05:09.498 --> 05:11.231
What is wrong
with you?

05:11.299 --> 05:12.414
What's wrong
with <i> you?</i>

05:12.482 --> 05:13.812
And who the hell
told you about...

05:13.880 --> 05:16.099
Oh, you goddamn
blabbermouth bird.

05:16.167 --> 05:17.433
They already knew
about it!

05:17.505 --> 05:19.648
And they were gonna
leave you in the quicksand

05:19.716 --> 05:20.687
while they looked for it.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.348
- What?
- Nuh-uh!

05:21.416 --> 05:22.263
Damn it, bird!

05:22.370 --> 05:23.896
Are you...
Mother, is that true?

05:23.964 --> 05:25.247
You were just gonna
let us die?

05:25.318 --> 05:26.812
Oh, please,
what do you think

05:26.880 --> 05:27.947
we're doing here?

05:28.015 --> 05:29.218
We came to rescue you

05:29.286 --> 05:31.551
from these
bloodthirsty cannibals.

05:31.619 --> 05:32.703
Which...

05:32.771 --> 05:35.240
- Oh. Yeah, no, they're cool.
- Well...

05:35.308 --> 05:36.992
Mother, this is
the cannibal chief.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.526
Chief, my lying
and scheming mother.

05:39.594 --> 05:41.427
Charmed, I'm sure.

05:41.530 --> 05:42.773
So they're not cannibals?

05:42.841 --> 05:44.364
Oh, no,
they're totally cannibals,

05:44.433 --> 05:45.927
but we've temporarily
teamed up

05:45.995 --> 05:47.484
to fight some
Nazi stormtroopers.

05:47.552 --> 05:49.003
- Wait, what?
- <i>Mon Dieu!</i>

05:49.071 --> 05:50.354
Stormtroopers?

05:50.422 --> 05:52.268
- It's a cognate.
- Noah!

05:52.359 --> 05:53.425
Mua Mua:
<i>Kalua. Kalua. Kalua.</i>

05:53.492 --> 05:55.183
And what is happening
right now?

05:55.251 --> 05:56.289
<i>Kalua.</i>

05:56.357 --> 05:57.448
What is <i> kalua?</i>

05:57.516 --> 05:59.778
It means... goddess.

06:00.479 --> 06:01.559
Wow!

06:01.627 --> 06:04.541
Okay, that's embarrassing.

06:04.610 --> 06:06.536
Tell them I'm not
an actual goddess

06:06.604 --> 06:08.517
but merely a direct
descendant of, um,

06:08.611 --> 06:10.524
who's-its, their god, um,
what's-his-face.

06:10.658 --> 06:12.679
No, no, no, no, no,
they... they don't mean you.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.086
They mean her.

06:14.245 --> 06:15.276
- Oh, boy.
- <i>Zut alors.</i>

06:15.344 --> 06:16.752
Oh, for the love.

06:16.823 --> 06:19.937
- Wow, that <i> is</i> embarrassing.
- Oh, shut up.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.366
I'll tell you
what's embarrassing

06:21.434 --> 06:23.756
is getting slaughtered by a
bunch of Nazi stormtroopers,

06:23.824 --> 06:25.861
so... can we all
please focus, Noah?

06:25.929 --> 06:27.033
Tell them to focus!

06:27.101 --> 06:28.134
Uh...

06:28.202 --> 06:29.851
<i>uzuka, bita kuju.</i>

06:29.929 --> 06:32.296
<i>Bita kuju!</i>

06:33.772 --> 06:34.812
Aww!

06:34.880 --> 06:35.960
Well, on the bright side,

06:36.028 --> 06:37.838
if you don't get murdered,
maybe you can move here

06:37.905 --> 06:39.713
and be worshipped
as a goddess.

06:39.781 --> 06:44.242
What mere mortal
dare speak to Kalua?

06:45.225 --> 06:46.257
Mm, okay.

06:46.325 --> 06:47.380
<i>Okay!</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:48.581
Listen up!

06:48.649 --> 06:50.364
These savage cannibals
have murdered

06:50.432 --> 06:51.583
and by now,
let's be honest,

06:51.650 --> 06:53.994
probably eaten
one of your <i> Kameraden.</i>

06:54.185 --> 06:56.669
So we are going to destroy
their village

06:56.737 --> 06:58.166
and everyone in it,

06:58.234 --> 06:59.643
men, women, and...

06:59.775 --> 07:02.142
You there!
What are you eating?

07:08.617 --> 07:11.072
Well, did you bring
enough for everyone?

07:12.621 --> 07:14.789
Well, then what are
you waiting for?

07:14.857 --> 07:16.040
Pass them out!

07:16.780 --> 07:19.463
- Now, any questions?
- Umm...

07:20.611 --> 07:23.306
It's just something
we're doing.

07:23.665 --> 07:24.931
I forget why.

07:25.038 --> 07:26.203
And also, shut up.

07:32.872 --> 07:34.145
Psst. Noah.

07:34.239 --> 07:35.655
You told them
to hold their fire

07:35.723 --> 07:37.164
until the Krauts
are in close, right?

07:37.238 --> 07:38.756
- Mm-hmm.
- And to fall back

07:38.824 --> 07:39.976
when they start
to get overrun?

07:40.043 --> 07:41.161
- Mm-hmm.
- And to...

07:41.229 --> 07:42.514
Wait, what is wrong
with you?

07:42.582 --> 07:44.098
What, are you kidding?
I'm scared!

07:44.166 --> 07:46.592
Oh. Well, yeah,
I mean, that's normal.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.483
Uh, no, I think
I'm scared-er than that!

07:48.551 --> 07:50.991
Trust me, however scared
you think you are, it's...

07:51.059 --> 07:52.613
I pissed in my pants, man.

07:52.684 --> 07:54.530
Still well within normal.

07:54.598 --> 07:56.480
Nobody else pissed
in their pants.

07:56.582 --> 07:59.095
Well, but remember,
they're not wearing pants.

07:59.165 --> 08:01.295
- That's not...
- Plus, there's no way

08:01.363 --> 08:04.084
they can possibly imagine
the unspeakable things

08:04.152 --> 08:06.902
that modern firearms can do
to the human body.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.131
So... try not
to get shot.

08:09.199 --> 08:11.057
That's it?
That's your advice?

08:11.125 --> 08:12.615
That's really good advice!

08:12.683 --> 08:14.029
<i>Isn't this exciting?</i>

08:14.096 --> 08:15.647
What, being held
against our will

08:15.715 --> 08:17.097
while we get attacked
by Nazis?

08:17.165 --> 08:19.225
Or discovering
the one culture on Earth

08:19.293 --> 08:21.928
that lacks a basic knowledge
of fermentation?

08:21.996 --> 08:24.308
I don't know.
I guess all of it.

08:26.141 --> 08:29.060
Hmm, now,
what have we here?

08:29.252 --> 08:30.709
I could've found
that stupid idol

08:30.777 --> 08:32.769
and been halfway
to New York by now!

08:32.837 --> 08:33.871
Oh, no!

08:33.948 --> 08:35.803
That idol's
all mine, missy.

08:35.871 --> 08:38.394
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.590
Outta the way,
Blimpkins!

08:40.879 --> 08:41.972
Are you...

08:42.126 --> 08:43.628
You are serious.

08:43.769 --> 08:45.519
Hey, can you please
tell him to move?

08:45.590 --> 08:50.184
Who calls upon
the almighty Kalua?

08:50.340 --> 08:53.434
Yeah, that's not
already old.

08:53.664 --> 08:55.449
Your Almightiness,
did I hear you say

08:55.518 --> 08:57.940
you were hungry
for oysters?

08:58.223 --> 08:59.428
Yes!

08:59.496 --> 09:02.543
Mortal, fetch me
some bivalves.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.162
Budge up, big un.

09:04.230 --> 09:05.840
- What?
- Back in a jiff!

09:06.132 --> 09:07.902
Toodles!

09:08.591 --> 09:09.863
Pam:
Any sign of 'em?

09:09.931 --> 09:11.842
No, because I don't have
binocular vision!

09:11.910 --> 09:13.412
I'm totally wasted here!

09:13.488 --> 09:16.147
Me too!
Well, not totally, but...

09:16.215 --> 09:17.676
No, and stop that!

09:17.744 --> 09:19.983
I should be in the air,
like a reconnaissance plane.

09:20.051 --> 09:21.553
Yeah, right,
like you'd come back.

09:21.621 --> 09:23.897
Wh...
I came back! I'm here!

09:23.965 --> 09:25.902
Yeah, nice
decision tree, bird.

09:25.970 --> 09:27.210
And where the hell'd
you get that?

09:27.277 --> 09:28.879
- Made it.
- What? When?

09:28.919 --> 09:30.707
I don't know.
A minute ago.

09:30.919 --> 09:33.307
Whatever's in these
crazy bastards is, like...

09:33.769 --> 09:35.391
really helping me focus.

09:35.499 --> 09:37.018
It's poison.

09:37.086 --> 09:38.547
So's booze.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.292
What's up your dickhole?

09:40.360 --> 09:42.360
I just... all these people
put their trust in me,

09:42.430 --> 09:44.016
and what if I fail them?

09:44.146 --> 09:46.175
What if...
What if I get them all killed?

09:46.243 --> 09:49.641
I mean, they <i> were</i>
gonna eat us, so...

09:49.750 --> 09:50.820
That's a fair point.

09:50.929 --> 09:52.768
Hey, you know,
people eat birds all the time.

09:52.836 --> 09:53.721
Why is that okay?

09:53.789 --> 09:55.130
'Cause birds
are delicious.

09:55.197 --> 09:56.612
Well, you're probably
not, but...

09:56.680 --> 09:58.198
I bet I'm totally delicious.

09:58.267 --> 10:01.227
Oh, please,
you were born in the 18...

10:01.438 --> 10:03.271
What the hell was that?

10:03.339 --> 10:04.238
Mortar!

10:04.306 --> 10:06.406
Fuchs:
Fire!

10:12.770 --> 10:14.508
My God, listen to that!

10:14.578 --> 10:17.274
You can hear their women
scream from here!

10:18.586 --> 10:21.086
So I hope someone
brought potatoes.

10:21.172 --> 10:22.485
Whoo-hoo!

10:22.640 --> 10:24.556
Fire!

10:28.577 --> 10:29.680
<i>Merde!</i>

10:29.789 --> 10:32.332
<i>Doudou, devrions-nous courir?</i>

10:32.507 --> 10:35.546
<i>Jésus, tu es le pire putain.</i>

10:36.305 --> 10:38.088
Nazi punks!
Fuck off!

10:38.156 --> 10:39.635
We gotta take out
that mortar!

10:39.703 --> 10:41.002
Yeah, but how?

10:41.070 --> 10:43.427
I'm gonna charge it.

10:46.092 --> 10:47.374
What?

10:48.659 --> 10:49.874
What did you say?

10:52.828 --> 10:53.945
No!

10:54.171 --> 10:56.007
Fire!

10:56.075 --> 10:58.486
Okay, Noah, you're gonna
go back to the States,

10:58.554 --> 11:00.002
and you're gonna tell Dad
he was right,

11:00.069 --> 11:01.843
and you're gonna take
that job at...

11:02.257 --> 11:04.093
At Uncle Mort's modeling agency,

11:04.161 --> 11:05.166
and guess what.

11:05.234 --> 11:06.900
You're just going
to have to start

11:06.968 --> 11:09.843
slathering tanning oil
on Swedish bikini models.

11:10.609 --> 11:11.973
That's it, I'm going for it!

11:12.041 --> 11:12.809
- Mm-kay.
- Good luck.

11:12.877 --> 11:13.538
That's it?

11:13.606 --> 11:15.249
- I mean... - I mean...
- Sterling!

11:15.317 --> 11:16.612
What are you doing
running around?

11:16.679 --> 11:18.648
The air's, like, 50% metal!

11:18.734 --> 11:21.536
Well, exactly,
and speaking of percentages,

11:21.614 --> 11:24.171
you seem to have this
whole thing pretty well in hand,

11:24.239 --> 11:25.809
so I thought
I'd just tootle off

11:25.877 --> 11:28.457
and see if I can't find
that pesky idol.

11:28.525 --> 11:29.817
- Are you...
- For us!

11:29.885 --> 11:31.325
Me and you, 50/50!

11:31.460 --> 11:33.020
- I...
- He has partners, you know.

11:33.088 --> 11:33.955
Oh, my God.

11:34.023 --> 11:35.222
Well, if he wants
to give you

11:35.290 --> 11:37.684
half of his half,
that's his business, but...

11:37.752 --> 11:39.692
What half?
What happened to thirdsies?

11:39.760 --> 11:41.981
Yeah, what did happen
to thirdsies?

11:42.049 --> 11:43.871
Wait, since when
was it thirdsies?

11:43.939 --> 11:46.020
Oh, my God!
First of all, we...

11:46.088 --> 11:47.582
Wait, what are you drinking?

11:47.650 --> 11:49.832
Apparently,
it's some kind of beer

11:49.900 --> 11:53.020
made from some jungle fruit
these people chew into a paste

11:53.088 --> 11:56.369
and then spit into
these gourds to ferment.

11:57.537 --> 12:00.517
It's a bit like
a phlegm sangria.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.103
Hmm. Is it good?

12:03.751 --> 12:04.853
You know...

12:05.080 --> 12:06.176
Son of a...

12:06.244 --> 12:08.158
That was my only gourd!

12:08.297 --> 12:09.396
Give me that!
Wh-

12:09.483 --> 12:10.752
What are you...

12:16.545 --> 12:19.568
Nazi sons of bitches.

12:22.302 --> 12:24.351
She took out
the whole mortar team!

12:24.419 --> 12:26.091
Wh...
I was gonna do that!

12:26.159 --> 12:27.340
Okay.

12:27.408 --> 12:28.260
Yeah, right.

12:28.328 --> 12:30.462
- Here, I think it's broken.
- I...

12:30.530 --> 12:33.169
And look,
the natives are rallying!

12:47.940 --> 12:49.007
<i>Ja! Ja!</i>

12:49.075 --> 12:50.759
<i>Schiesse diese Scheisse!</i>

12:50.827 --> 12:52.447
Schneider,
radio the ship!

12:52.515 --> 12:54.263
Tell them we need...

12:54.722 --> 12:56.721
Well, a new Schneider, for one.

13:00.513 --> 13:04.521
<i>Batu baruka!
Batu baruka!</i>

13:09.796 --> 13:11.696
Because I don't want
to die in a hut,

13:11.765 --> 13:13.632
defiled by
Nazi stormtroopers!

13:13.700 --> 13:15.735
Well, I can't die.
I'm immortal.

13:15.806 --> 13:17.686
But even though time
is meaningless to me,

13:17.779 --> 13:19.806
what is taking so long
with these oysters?

13:19.873 --> 13:21.675
Well, don't ask him,

13:21.742 --> 13:23.396
'cause he sure as hell
doesn't have any.

13:23.464 --> 13:25.531
- Meaning?
- He's a eunuch?

13:25.863 --> 13:27.639
Oh, come on!
He has no testicles!

13:27.707 --> 13:29.561
Ew. And also, so?

13:29.629 --> 13:31.165
So what do you think

13:31.233 --> 13:32.801
these people use
for oysters?

13:32.869 --> 13:35.163
Uh, presumably oysters?

13:35.233 --> 13:36.506
Balls.

13:36.574 --> 13:38.540
Wait, what?
Why would they eat...

13:38.608 --> 13:39.659
Because they're cannibals.

13:39.727 --> 13:41.959
Cannibals don't
only eat people!

13:42.062 --> 13:44.225
I'm sure they have...
side salads!

13:44.294 --> 13:45.715
You think he eats
a lot of salad?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.717
I think if I tell him to,
he'll eat you.

13:49.776 --> 13:50.935
I take your point.

13:51.041 --> 13:52.659
Muh-muh-muh-muh.

13:57.515 --> 13:59.849
Fall back!
Fall back! Fall back!

14:00.063 --> 14:01.229
Where the...

14:01.334 --> 14:02.901
Noah! Noah?

14:03.077 --> 14:04.206
Y-yeah?

14:04.410 --> 14:05.774
What are you doing, Noah?

14:05.842 --> 14:07.925
Oh, I-I'm hiding
under this corpse.

14:07.993 --> 14:09.555
- But otherwise...
- I mean...

14:09.623 --> 14:10.889
Well, then can you
please tell them

14:10.956 --> 14:12.195
to fall back
so we can lure

14:12.263 --> 14:13.992
these Nazi pukes
into our killing zones?

14:14.060 --> 14:15.793
Oh, yes, yes,
of course.

14:15.829 --> 14:16.938
Oh, now! Sorry.

14:17.032 --> 14:19.266
Uh,<i> atzera! Atzera!</i>

14:19.469 --> 14:23.084
<i>Atzera!
Batu baruka atzera!</i>

14:23.155 --> 14:24.870
And how do you say,
"Get ready"?

14:24.938 --> 14:26.938
Um...

14:27.073 --> 14:28.091
- Noah?
- Oh, no, sorry.

14:28.193 --> 14:29.419
<i>Kokatu. Kokatu.</i>

14:29.487 --> 14:30.818
- Thanks, idiot.
- Yep!

14:30.886 --> 14:33.920
<i>Kokatu! Kokatu!</i>

14:35.414 --> 14:37.581
<i>Kokatu! Kokatu!</i>

14:37.649 --> 14:38.900
They are retreating!

14:38.968 --> 14:40.560
Attack! Attack!

14:40.628 --> 14:42.326
<i>Vorwaerts!</i>

14:44.608 --> 14:48.760
<i>Kokatu! Kokatu! Kokatu!</i>

14:49.251 --> 14:52.197
What is that?
What is he screaming?

14:52.493 --> 14:53.999
"Here come the Krauts."

14:54.067 --> 14:56.142
Ugh, finally.

14:56.768 --> 14:58.701
They might have schnapps.

15:10.087 --> 15:11.673
Yeah!

15:11.741 --> 15:13.774
Aw, man, did you see that?

15:13.846 --> 15:16.479
Yeah, that was the pits!
Am I right?

15:16.547 --> 15:17.590
- Eh.
- Eh.

15:17.658 --> 15:20.126
- Oh, whatever.
- Shut up, bird.

15:22.528 --> 15:23.996
<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

15:24.064 --> 15:26.898
<i>Was ist los? Was ist los?</i>

15:33.451 --> 15:35.915
It's working!

15:36.043 --> 15:38.423
- Chief, it's working!
- Mm.

15:38.498 --> 15:40.142
Chief, you are
a tough room.

15:40.210 --> 15:41.307
<i>Was machen wir?</i>

15:41.375 --> 15:43.143
<i>Umgruppieren!
Umgruppier...</i>

15:43.842 --> 15:45.260
<i>Gott im Himm...</i>

15:45.470 --> 15:48.010
<i>Rueckzug! Rueckzug!</i>

15:49.039 --> 15:51.565
<i>Was ist...</i>

15:55.037 --> 15:57.871
Whoo! Chub Club!

15:58.065 --> 15:59.262
That was the last
of 'em!

15:59.330 --> 16:02.512
Yeah! Take that,
you Nazi bastards!

16:02.580 --> 16:04.682
Well, don't just
stand there and gawk.

16:04.750 --> 16:07.283
Go loot their corpses
for schnapps!

16:24.979 --> 16:26.369
Huh.

16:26.437 --> 16:28.215
Mua Mua:
<i>Dugu! Nik andu! Dugu! Nik and!</i>

16:28.283 --> 16:29.380
What are they chanting?

16:29.466 --> 16:31.300
- Death to whites!
- No offense!

16:31.368 --> 16:33.450
- Death to whites!
- No offense!

16:33.518 --> 16:34.449
- Huh.
- Yeah.

16:34.517 --> 16:35.981
Again, they're super racist.

16:36.049 --> 16:38.314
- But also weirdly polite.
- Eh.

16:38.403 --> 16:41.139
We showed those
German bastards, eh?

16:41.207 --> 16:43.330
What "we"?
Where the hell were you?

16:43.408 --> 16:46.455
Fighting!
Those German bastards!

16:46.523 --> 16:47.655
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, right.

16:47.723 --> 16:50.065
I shot maybe ten
German bastards.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.634
Okay, well, as long
as I get the credit

16:52.702 --> 16:54.533
for the winning
battle plan, I...

16:54.601 --> 16:56.504
Victory is mine!

16:56.572 --> 16:59.642
All hail Kalua!

16:59.710 --> 17:01.541
Uh, you don't.

17:19.816 --> 17:21.015
Huh?

17:22.961 --> 17:25.662
Way to go,
toothless old lady!

17:26.561 --> 17:29.714
And now I think
it's feast o'clock!

17:29.843 --> 17:31.925
Hey, shouldn't we, um,
go make sure

17:31.993 --> 17:33.878
that guy's, like,
dead or whatever?

17:33.946 --> 17:36.747
No, dummy. Why do you think
they call it the widowmaker?

17:36.815 --> 17:37.856
Well, yeah,
but you made that up.

17:37.923 --> 17:39.725
Probably won't get credit
for that either.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.565
<i>Teko! Besta!
Teko! Besta!</i>

17:43.633 --> 17:45.738
<i>Teko! Besta!</i>

18:08.095 --> 18:09.738
Whoo!

18:09.806 --> 18:12.660
Oh, man, are feasts
not the best?

18:12.728 --> 18:14.792
Not this one.
Don't eat that!

18:14.860 --> 18:16.279
Come on, try it!

18:16.347 --> 18:17.699
It tastes like chicken!

18:17.767 --> 18:19.183
I don't eat chicken!

18:19.370 --> 18:22.120
Yes! Finally!
Oysters!

18:22.223 --> 18:24.138
Oh, fun fact:
even though they serve those

18:24.206 --> 18:25.355
on oyster shells,

18:25.423 --> 18:27.217
they're actually
human testicles.

18:27.285 --> 18:28.769
Ha!

18:28.990 --> 18:31.958
Well, I mean,
at this point...

18:32.026 --> 18:33.355
you know?

18:34.262 --> 18:36.636
- Oh, wait!
- Oh, thank God.

18:36.704 --> 18:38.991
Noah, how do you say
"mignonette"?

18:39.059 --> 18:40.743
Oh, it's the same.
"Mignonette."

18:40.811 --> 18:41.876
- Seriously?
- What?

18:41.944 --> 18:43.493
Yeah, it's a loanword.

18:44.294 --> 18:46.130
Just the worst.
