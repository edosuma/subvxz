WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:05.464
Wow.

00:06.507 --> 00:08.007
"Leave Mythic Quest."

00:08.090 --> 00:09.801
Feels weird to even say.

00:10.302 --> 00:11.637
Feels like I grew up here.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.096
Sounds good, Poppy.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.350
But I really just need to know
your start date.

00:16.767 --> 00:18.393
When are you giving
your notice over there?

00:18.477 --> 00:19.811
Yeah. Today. Now.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.605
I'm just waiting for the right time.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.107
You know, he's so volatile.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.777
These narcissists,
you're at their every whim.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.570
They're up, they're down,
they're left, they're right.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.030
You never know where they're gonna land.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.991
Well, the good news is that you won't
have to deal with that much longer.

00:33.075 --> 00:36.036
'Cause we're all about reliability
and consistency here.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.998
Great. Because I am done with the drama.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.253
Ian, we need to talk. Where are you?

00:44.670 --> 00:45.879
I'm over here.

00:47.089 --> 00:49.132
I didn't see you there.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.385
Sorry, what is this?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.761
Nothing.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.722
Just a man falling apart...

00:56.890 --> 00:58.225
before your very eyes.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.396
Come on.

01:15.617 --> 01:18.745
All right.
Are you ready to put on a show, Wyld_D?

01:19.454 --> 01:21.540
Brad, is it cool
if I leave a little early today?

01:21.832 --> 01:25.043
I know you don't like when I talk about my
personal life, but all these long hours--

01:25.127 --> 01:27.629
You're right. I don't like
when you talk about your personal life.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.673
Now, I need you to start
pushing my new product.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.842
It's called the Sword of Time.
Have a seat.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.969
Okay, it's this new chase item
I'm putting into the game.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.221
I'm gonna charge like 250 thou.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.807
Are you kidding me?
No one is gonna buy that.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.184
No, they're probably not.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.978
But it's a dragon that they can chase,
and people need that.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.898
Something just beyond their reach
that gets 'em up in the morning.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.983
Hey! Where my average peeps at?

01:48.859 --> 01:49.943
Yo, Dana.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.486
What up, Bradley?

01:51.570 --> 01:54.406
Rocking the merch from the fight.
I sold a shit ton of those.

01:54.489 --> 01:57.159
I am embracing mediocrity.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.495
You see, everyone loved
that the Masked Man reveal was Pootie.

02:00.913 --> 02:02.539
While I thought the story resolved

02:02.623 --> 02:05.334
with all the grace of a hobo
shitting on a sidewalk.

02:05.417 --> 02:06.502
Hot take.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.130
But, alas, the public has spoken.

02:10.214 --> 02:12.549
So, I shall go with the flow

02:12.633 --> 02:17.471
and be swept away
on the riptide of mediocrity.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.598
I mean, what do I know?

02:21.517 --> 02:22.809
Fry?

02:22.893 --> 02:24.937
Okay, he's going through something.

02:25.020 --> 02:27.689
Big smiles, and we're rolling.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.775
Oh, my God!

02:30.359 --> 02:31.818
Wyld_D.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.239
So, I'm really excited
to be streaming with y'all today

02:35.322 --> 02:37.783
and to try out this new game
that I got in the mail.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.077
Which is from one of my sponsors.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.788
Something's not right.
She seems really upset.

02:42.871 --> 02:43.997
Yeah.

02:45.541 --> 02:47.084
'Kay. Let's go.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.919
Can you not read facial expressions?

02:49.336 --> 02:51.171
It's a key trait of psychopaths.

02:51.463 --> 02:53.006
I'm not a psychopath, Lou.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.302
Yeah, probably not.
Psychopaths are generally charming.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.848
I can just tell
when something's bothering her, okay?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.767
Pancakes are nice and fluffy.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.727
Waffles,
they can have a little crisp to it.

03:05.811 --> 03:06.937
I gotta do something.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.439
Cool, so what's the plan?
You gonna lure her into the woods?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.316
I am not a psychopath, Lou! Okay?

03:11.400 --> 03:12.901
I am going to lure her out--

03:13.861 --> 03:16.280
take her out and cheer her up.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.117
Rachel, I'm sorry. Don't murder her.

03:20.534 --> 03:21.618
Why'd I turn around?

03:21.702 --> 03:23.370
Because you have feelings for me.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.999
But I've made myself clear.
They are not reciprocated.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.384
Here we are. The open road.

03:40.095 --> 03:45.058
It's the open road. The open--
You know, I'm just gonna turn this down!

03:45.142 --> 03:46.143
Okay.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.187
The open road.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.607
So, where are we going?

03:51.940 --> 03:53.942
Can't tell you, Pop.
You just gotta trust me.

03:54.026 --> 03:58.030
But just know that it's really important
to me that you're here with me.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.242
It's just something
I've had to take care of for a long time.

04:03.452 --> 04:04.453
Yeah.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.707
Yeah, sometimes you have to take care
of things before they get too big.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.877
How long have we
been working together now?

04:11.960 --> 04:13.253
Like eight years?

04:14.087 --> 04:15.839
I don't know. I don't really do calendars.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.216
Sure, sure.

04:17.841 --> 04:21.094
I guess what I'm saying is,
life's funny, isn't it?

04:23.972 --> 04:24.973
-No.
-Okay.

04:25.057 --> 04:27.100
Well, just let me finish my thought there.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.103
It's crazy how long
we've known each other.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.231
I mean,
I'm a completely different person now

04:32.314 --> 04:35.567
to the 19-year-old
that you plucked from MIT.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.277
And-- And sometimes, Ian--

04:37.361 --> 04:39.905
You know my real name is "Ee-an"?

04:40.906 --> 04:41.990
What?

04:42.074 --> 04:43.784
"Ee-an" is my dad's name.

04:44.660 --> 04:47.204
He is... not a good dude.

04:50.707 --> 04:55.462
That's a cigarette burn I got
for not turning the Nintendo off in time.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.215
Shit. That's terrible.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.717
You have any experience with that?

05:02.845 --> 05:03.846
No.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.432
It's not great.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.020
Anyway, one day I just decided
I didn't want his name anymore.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.232
So I started calling myself "Eye-an."

05:16.149 --> 05:17.442
And that was that.

05:19.903 --> 05:21.864
I've never told anybody that before.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.200
Why are you telling me now?

05:28.579 --> 05:29.955
I don't know.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.461
Hey, Pop, I know that I don't always
tell ya how much I value you,

05:36.545 --> 05:38.172
you know, and the work you do,

05:38.255 --> 05:40.674
but I'm gonna try harder.

05:41.300 --> 05:44.052
I'm gonna try harder, I promise.
I'm gonna do better.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.809
Why, man? Why? Why now? Why?

05:50.893 --> 05:53.228
Now's as good a time as any, isn't it?

05:55.230 --> 05:59.234
Okay, this is not really going
how I planned it.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.119
There's the man of the hour.

06:09.203 --> 06:10.621
Congrats, buddy.

06:12.080 --> 06:16.418
We just made a quarter of a million
dollars off that Sword of Time thingy.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.795
What was it? Yeah.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.090
That's impossible. I just pushed it live.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.134
250 G's. Awesome.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.427
You must be so excited.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.472
Yeah, I should be. I mean, I am.

06:29.640 --> 06:30.933
I'm not. I might puke.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.977
Oh, my God, I just sold someone air
for the price of a goddamn house?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.395
Okay, I need to sit down.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.022
You-- You okay, buddy?

06:37.105 --> 06:39.733
No. These Saudi princes
and Silicon Valley douchebags

06:39.816 --> 06:41.568
will buy any piece of shit
I put out there.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.196
Which means my job is irrelevant.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.533
What am I doing with my life?

06:48.242 --> 06:51.703
I've been feeling the same way ever since
Ian chose Poppy as his assistant over me.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.289
Poppy is not Ian's assistant.
Neither are you.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.375
Well, you don't have to rub it in, David.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.006
Okay. Listen.

07:03.549 --> 07:08.303
As exec producer, it falls on me
to help when my employees' morale is low.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.889
Don't worry. I've handled
this type of thing before to great effect.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.517
Save for Teddy Villarreal
from Digital Assets,

07:13.600 --> 07:15.936
who was gonna jump into
that stone quarry no matter what.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.813
So, anyway, let's dig in,

07:17.896 --> 07:21.024
and I will have you guys
feeling better in no time.

07:21.692 --> 07:23.735
Feel good? Questions?

07:25.821 --> 07:27.865
-Yeah.
-What happened to Teddy?

07:27.948 --> 07:30.075
Well, exactly what you think happened.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.493
-What?
-Did they recover his body?

07:31.577 --> 07:33.370
They recovered enough.
No more questions about Teddy.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.080
Any other questions
about what we're gonna do?

07:35.163 --> 07:36.540
Let's just keep going. Let's move.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.462
Sweet! A diner. I could eat.

07:43.422 --> 07:46.091
Pop, I'm gonna ask you to wait in the car.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.093
I need to do this alone.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.970
But you asked me to come with you.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.431
Yeah.
And you're doing an awesome job so far.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.685
Okay. Sure, go ahead.

07:56.768 --> 07:57.603
Okay.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.897
Actually, can I just jump in
and use the bathroom real quick?

07:59.980 --> 08:00.981
No.

08:01.064 --> 08:02.399
Okay.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.652
Well, good luck
with whatever it is you're doing.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.197
Seriously, thank you...

08:09.948 --> 08:10.991
partner.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.079
Okay... partner.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.147
Hey, Dan Williams. It's Poppy here.

08:42.563 --> 08:43.565
Again.

08:43.649 --> 08:47.319
Look, my situation has changed.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.571
Ian and I have come to an understanding,

08:49.655 --> 08:51.740
and things are gonna be different now.

08:51.823 --> 08:54.326
Sorry,
but if I'm being honest with myself,

08:54.409 --> 08:56.912
I think this is exactly
where I need to be right now.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.666
So, sorry.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.919
Okay, bye.

09:24.398 --> 09:25.899
Hello, Brendan.

09:26.775 --> 09:27.860
Hello, Dad.

09:31.071 --> 09:35.617
Now, any job worked over a long period
of time can start to feel meaningless.

09:35.701 --> 09:37.369
Which is why I came up with a system

09:37.452 --> 09:40.831
that breaks the workday down
into a series of concrete tasks

09:40.914 --> 09:43.458
followed by concrete rewards.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.836
I like to reward myself

09:46.545 --> 09:49.548
with a little something
that makes me happy.

09:50.883 --> 09:51.884
A cookie?

09:51.967 --> 09:54.344
If I finish all of my tasks
on my to-do list,

09:54.428 --> 09:56.847
then I reward myself
with this tasty treat.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.058
I'm a chocoholic.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.936
You give yourself a cookie
for doing your job?

10:03.645 --> 10:04.730
That is so sad.

10:04.813 --> 10:09.151
No, no. I give myself a piece of cookie
for doing a bit of my job.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.652
Seem so sad now?

10:10.736 --> 10:13.155
I'm starting to understand why Teddy
took that header into the stone quarry.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.489
No! That is not what--

10:14.573 --> 10:17.492
Look, I cannot solve clinical depression
with a cookie.

10:18.035 --> 10:19.578
And let me tell you something,
that man had a death wish.

10:19.661 --> 10:22.581
Nothing was gonna stop Teddy
jumping his dirt bike into that quarry.

10:23.165 --> 10:24.917
Where there was light,
he just saw darkness.

10:25.000 --> 10:29.671
Now, we just need to come up with a reward
that each of you guys can work towards.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.174
So, Brad, what's something
that gives you a little joy?

10:32.966 --> 10:35.469
-Predator-prey videos.
-What is that? I don't know what that is.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.554
You know,
like a killer whale eating a seal

10:37.638 --> 10:40.140
or a cheetah running down a gazelle
and ripping out its throat.

10:40.224 --> 10:41.225
Stuff like that.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.352
Have you seen the one
where the alligator bites the python,

10:43.435 --> 10:46.230
but then the python wraps himself around
the alligator and they both die?

10:46.313 --> 10:47.481
-That one's great.
-Okay, yeah.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.399
Let's just stick with the cookie, guys.

10:49.483 --> 10:51.693
It seems like a simpler reward.

10:51.777 --> 10:54.947
So the next thing we need
is to identify a manageable task.

10:55.030 --> 10:57.199
So, Brad,
what's something you can accomplish next?

10:57.282 --> 10:59.618
I don't know. I guess we could
sell naming rights to the coliseum

10:59.701 --> 11:01.203
for like a million bucks.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.164
That is a great idea. Look at you!

11:04.248 --> 11:06.875
"Naming rights to the coliseum." Love it.

11:07.292 --> 11:11.338
Hey, and guess what?
That is what I call a task accomplished.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.924
Brad gets a cookie.

11:15.092 --> 11:16.927
There we go.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.721
And I'm gonna do it one more time.

11:19.805 --> 11:22.099
Look at that.
You got some chocolate chunks in there.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.559
That is gonna be good.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.854
Okay, so, Jo, what is something
you'd like to accomplish today?

11:27.396 --> 11:30.399
Same thing I want every day:
to help people achieve their goals.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.984
That's great and surprisingly not weird.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.152
And you can accomplish that today.
That is your job.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.487
But Ian's not here.

11:35.571 --> 11:38.991
But I am, and I am your boss, all right?

11:39.074 --> 11:41.201
Assist me. You understand?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.496
-I guess.
-She guesses. Look at that.

11:44.580 --> 11:46.540
We're making progress. Unbelievable.

11:46.623 --> 11:50.169
Okay, so,
my job is to help you guys today.

11:50.252 --> 11:54.840
So, in a way, assisting you will help me
in being a better assistant to you.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.760
This is so confusing.
I'm just gonna take notes and not talk.

11:59.261 --> 12:00.679
Look out.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.931
Hey, Jo, you're assisting me.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.642
Cookie earned. Look at that.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.854
And in half. There you go.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.315
All right, guys.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.026
Cheers.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.289
You the new one?

12:27.998 --> 12:29.249
Sorry, excuse me?

12:30.334 --> 12:32.419
-You're here with Ian, right?
-Oh, yeah.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.046
I saw you pull up. I'm Shannon.

12:34.505 --> 12:36.590
Hi. I'm Brendan's mom.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.092
-Hi, Shannon.
-Hi.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.719
Sorry, who's Brendan?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.013
Oh, my gosh. That's so cute. Pootie.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.933
Right. Brendan is Pootie Shoe.

12:46.016 --> 12:48.227
Why is Ian meeting with Pootie?

12:48.310 --> 12:50.103
Oh, my God. He didn't tell you?

12:50.562 --> 12:53.398
That is so typical of him.
Wow. Of course he wouldn't.

12:53.482 --> 12:55.859
Well, why should he? It's just his son.

12:56.235 --> 12:57.319
I'm sorry.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.739
Pootie Shoe is Ian's son?

13:00.822 --> 13:02.866
Christ, he really keeps you in the dark,
doesn't he?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.119
He was like that when we were together.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.330
Oh, no. We-- We're not together.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.332
We're just colleagues. Work colleagues.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.793
Equal colleagues. Partners, actually.

13:12.876 --> 13:17.798
Can I give you a piece of advice
before he knocks you up too?

13:17.881 --> 13:20.425
He's not gonna knock me up.
We're not gonna have-- We're never gonna--

13:20.509 --> 13:23.679
Oh, no, no. He knows
how to shine his light on you, right,

13:23.762 --> 13:28.809
and make you feel like you are
the most important person in the world,

13:28.892 --> 13:31.603
that you'll be together forever.

13:31.687 --> 13:32.938
You're partners.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.731
And then when you're feeling safest,

13:35.232 --> 13:37.317
he just shines that light somewhere else.

13:37.401 --> 13:38.694
Mostly on himself.

13:38.777 --> 13:42.573
And then the second it seems like
you may be on to something better...

13:43.866 --> 13:44.908
he can sense it.

13:45.742 --> 13:49.621
And that light comes right back to you.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.623
But it's bullshit.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.002
He just wants someone,

13:55.085 --> 13:57.296
he needs someone
to be his emotional lapdog.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.422
You understand?

13:59.131 --> 14:00.549
Always supporting him.

14:00.632 --> 14:03.260
Always there for him,
regardless of your own needs,

14:03.969 --> 14:07.264
and just waitin' for him to return.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.976
That sound right?

14:12.853 --> 14:15.272
Okay, Shannon.

14:15.355 --> 14:19.151
Well, you seem like a real-- a real gem.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.987
But I have to get back to--

14:22.070 --> 14:23.322
Sitting here.

14:24.907 --> 14:25.908
Waiting.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.178
Son of a bitch.

14:48.472 --> 14:49.765
Here you go.

14:51.433 --> 14:52.643
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

14:55.270 --> 14:56.855
So...

14:58.899 --> 15:02.444
how's your life?

15:02.528 --> 15:03.612
Why'd you call me here?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.867
Have you lost all of your baby teeth?

15:08.951 --> 15:10.369
'Cause I brought something.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.204
I'm 14, Dad.

15:12.871 --> 15:15.207
Right. Right, that's not--

15:15.290 --> 15:16.583
The timing's off.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.669
Sorry, I'm just a little flustered.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.839
Fourteen. Fourteen, right.
Oh, so you getting laid yet?

15:21.922 --> 15:24.174
-What the fuck, Dad?
-Also probably not appropriate.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.218
I'm not fucking getting laid. Are you--

15:26.927 --> 15:30.597
I'm sorry, man. I just...
I don't have a lot of practice with this.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.850
-Would you just bear with me?
-Right, yeah, no.

15:32.933 --> 15:36.103
Let's consider your needs
at the beginning of this summit.

15:36.728 --> 15:37.729
Okay, look.

15:37.813 --> 15:40.399
Brendan, I know that this is difficult
for you to understand,

15:40.482 --> 15:44.361
but me leaving was something that
your mother and I decided together.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.613
And then all of a sudden,
out of the blue, years later,

15:46.697 --> 15:50.325
you start streaming MQ, and then
you get bigger and bigger and bigger,

15:50.409 --> 15:51.910
and I didn't know what to do.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.162
I was just trying to find a way
to talk to you.

15:54.246 --> 15:56.540
Kind of an elaborate way to reach out,
don't you think?

15:56.623 --> 15:59.251
Well, I'm sorry. You know,
I didn't really have a lot of practice

15:59.334 --> 16:01.253
talking to dads
I hadn't seen in ten years,

16:01.336 --> 16:05.591
so forgive me for my brain being
a little scrambled, you fucking dick!

16:05.674 --> 16:08.218
I didn't know you were the Masked Man,
otherwise I would not have done it.

16:08.302 --> 16:10.971
Oh, wow. What about the time
you told me to kill myself?

16:11.054 --> 16:13.015
-I didn't tell you to kill yourself.
-Yes, he did.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.933
That wasn't me. That wasn't me.

16:15.017 --> 16:18.353
That was Jo. That was my assistant.
Technically, she's David's assistant.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.899
She's more of just
a free-floating agent of chaos.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.317
We should probably fire her.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.195
Wow. Sounds like you run
a real tight ship over there, Dad.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.529
Look, Brendan.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.949
I was never going to be a good dad.

16:31.366 --> 16:33.035
But I always took care of everything.

16:33.118 --> 16:36.580
The school, the house.
I took care of all of it.

16:37.080 --> 16:40.417
And the truth is
you were better off without me.

16:40.501 --> 16:42.336
Look at you, man.

16:42.419 --> 16:44.338
You have this great career,

16:44.421 --> 16:46.965
you've got money,
a great relationship with your mom.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.342
I don't know.

16:48.884 --> 16:54.681
Honestly, I feel like
I made the right decision here.

16:56.975 --> 16:59.895
-You just said the word "I" nine times.
-Did I?

16:59.978 --> 17:02.105
-That's ten.
-Wow, you can count shit like that?

17:02.189 --> 17:04.147
You're like Rain Man. Oh, my God.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.652
You really are, like, a genius.

17:06.983 --> 17:08.069
Hey, my kid's a genius.

17:09.444 --> 17:10.739
Hey, my son's a genius.

17:11.949 --> 17:15.160
Wow. Wow, everything's about you.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.413
I thought that maybe
you just felt enough guilt

17:18.497 --> 17:21.500
that you finally,
finally wanted to reconnect.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.960
-But no. No.
-Yeah.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.171
You just wanted me to tell you
that you didn't do anything wrong,

17:26.255 --> 17:28.549
that you're not a bad person,
and that you didn't mess up.

17:28.632 --> 17:31.468
Because everything is always about you.

17:31.552 --> 17:33.887
-No, no. That's not true. I--
-"I."

17:33.971 --> 17:35.764
-What I'm trying to say--
-"I'm."

17:35.848 --> 17:37.057
-I know, but I--
-Two more.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.517
-Okay, but I--
-"I."

17:39.893 --> 17:44.147
Well, how is a person supposed to talk
without using personal pronouns?

17:44.231 --> 17:47.150
Okay, you know what, I'm really too old
to be having this conversation.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.069
Wait, hold on a second.
Where are you going?

17:49.152 --> 17:51.613
Don't contact me again, Ian.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.740
-Okay, Son--
-No!

17:56.326 --> 17:57.786
I'm done with you.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.670
For the record,
I give this conversation zero buttholes.

18:09.965 --> 18:11.049
Pootie out!

18:17.514 --> 18:19.391
Hey, Dan Williams.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.269
It's Poppy, your new creative director.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.437
That's right, I'm back.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.230
Disregard my previous message.

18:25.314 --> 18:28.734
I'm done with Mythic Quest, and
I'm definitely done with all the drama.

18:28.817 --> 18:31.486
Like, for real this time.
So, I want the job.

18:31.904 --> 18:34.698
Great. Just call me back. Thanks. Bye.

18:37.326 --> 18:39.620
Hey, how'd it go in there? You okay?

18:40.037 --> 18:41.663
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:42.414 --> 18:45.000
Really?
There's nothing that you wanna share

18:45.083 --> 18:47.586
with the person that you dragged
all the way out here?

18:48.962 --> 18:50.589
No. I don't. Can we just go?

18:50.672 --> 18:54.259
No. Were you seriously not gonna tell me?

18:55.219 --> 18:58.889
I know that Pootie's your son.
I just met your ex. She told me.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.141
Shannon. How'd she look?

19:01.225 --> 19:03.769
-Batshit crazy!
-Yeah.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.812
Why did you bring me out here?

19:06.230 --> 19:07.314
For support.

19:07.731 --> 19:09.983
Of course. 'Cause I'm like
your emotional support animal

19:10.067 --> 19:13.487
that has to sit in the hot car
for an hour, like that dog!

19:14.696 --> 19:16.031
What dog?

19:17.491 --> 19:20.953
Okay, well, there was a dog there earlier,

19:21.036 --> 19:23.288
and it was a really apt metaphor!

19:23.372 --> 19:25.374
Okay, can we just
not do this right now, Poppy?

19:25.457 --> 19:28.126
You're right.
Let's not do this anymore. I quit.

19:29.086 --> 19:32.673
I'm gonna go work at Cold Alliance.
They're making me creative director.

19:32.756 --> 19:33.757
What do you...

19:35.717 --> 19:37.344
What are you gonna say to that?

19:39.137 --> 19:41.098
If that's what you wanna do,
I can't stop you.

19:44.226 --> 19:45.435
That's your reaction?

19:45.519 --> 19:46.520
Yeah.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.858
Whatever, man.
Get in the car. I'm driving.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.987
The dog! That's the dog!
There, look. He's real.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.698
He's real, and even he gets to
get out of the car and take a piss!

19:57.781 --> 20:01.535
Well, you know what, Ian,
I'm not the dog anymore! You're the dog!

20:02.661 --> 20:05.956
-Why do you hate dogs so much?
-I don't hate dogs.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.584
Listen to me very carefully, Ian.

20:09.084 --> 20:12.838
I hate you.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.009
I'm so sorry. I just noticed something.

20:17.092 --> 20:19.553
I think your part is on the wrong side
of your head.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.973
If we just moved it over to the other
side, it would open up your whole face.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.810
I am going to open up your face!

20:27.269 --> 20:28.395
Get in the car!

20:30.230 --> 20:31.315
Okay.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.699
Okay, Brad. So, now that you've identified
your next big-ticket item,

20:40.782 --> 20:42.576
all we have to do is get Dana to push it,

20:42.659 --> 20:45.454
and you are well on your way
to your second piece of cookie.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.498
-Where is Dana?
-Gone, Daddy-o.

20:48.582 --> 20:49.708
Whatever. All right.

20:49.791 --> 20:53.003
Uh... well, looks like our next task
is to find out where Dana is.

20:53.086 --> 20:54.087
I can do it.

20:54.171 --> 20:57.883
If I find Dana, that assists Brad,
and it assists you by assisting Brad.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.301
I'm on it.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.595
She's really taken to the system.

21:02.387 --> 21:04.223
C.W., what do you got going on here?

21:04.306 --> 21:07.226
Just enjoying
America's best-selling beverage,

21:07.518 --> 21:10.270
while watching the japery
of some purple buffoon.

21:11.522 --> 21:12.898
Roscoe. Classic.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.234
Yeah. Millions of people love him.

21:15.317 --> 21:17.611
So, must be good, right?

21:17.694 --> 21:18.695
Is he acting out?

21:18.779 --> 21:20.197
Yeah, like an 8-year-old.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.658
Okay, great.
Well, I can introduce you to my system.

21:22.741 --> 21:25.577
Although I don't know
if I have enough cookie to reward you.

21:27.204 --> 21:28.205
Oh, it's Poppy.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.876
Oh, my God.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.714
What is it?

21:38.924 --> 21:42.177
The Masked Man is Ian's son!

21:42.928 --> 21:44.763
It's his son!

21:44.847 --> 21:47.558
The narrative through line
has been restored.

21:47.975 --> 21:52.563
Quality literature resumes
its rightful throne!

21:58.610 --> 21:59.736
-Oh, my gosh.
-Shit!

22:00.237 --> 22:02.781
-It's got me! It's got me! It's got me!
-Wait, wait! Kill him!

22:02.865 --> 22:05.534
I'm trying. I'm trying.
How are they so fast?

22:06.702 --> 22:08.203
-No.
-Dammit.

22:09.621 --> 22:11.123
Ate our faces off.

22:13.292 --> 22:15.627
Thanks so much for getting me out.
I really needed this.

22:16.295 --> 22:17.629
Yeah. Of course.

22:17.713 --> 22:19.798
I know how much
you like spilling zombie blood,

22:19.882 --> 22:21.592
so I thought this would cheer you up.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.720
You do realize
we're in a small confined space,

22:24.803 --> 22:27.347
playing games,
sitting next to each other, right?

22:27.931 --> 22:30.058
We recreated what we do at work.

22:31.518 --> 22:35.772
Yeah. Well, you know,
what we used to do, anyway.

22:36.732 --> 22:38.650
Yeah. I guess you're right.

22:41.653 --> 22:43.113
I really miss you, Rache.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.534
You do?

22:48.744 --> 22:49.745
Yeah.

22:52.706 --> 22:53.790
Hey!

22:53.874 --> 22:55.125
-Shit!
-What are you two doing?

22:55.209 --> 22:57.586
Christ, Jo.
What the hell are you doing here?

22:58.921 --> 23:02.216
I'm doing my job, something the two of you
should consider doing once in a while.

23:02.299 --> 23:03.842
How did you even know we were here?

23:03.926 --> 23:05.052
It's not complicated.

23:05.135 --> 23:08.722
You're simple people with simple lives.
Now, move your asses back to work.

23:08.805 --> 23:10.182
You can't tell us what to do.

23:10.265 --> 23:12.434
Yeah. Don't be a narc, Jo.

23:12.518 --> 23:14.144
I'm not a narc.

23:14.728 --> 23:17.481
I'm David Brittlesbee's
motherfucking assistant.

23:17.564 --> 23:18.732
Now, move!

23:40.128 --> 23:42.130
Cheer up, princess.

23:43.549 --> 23:44.591
Okay, Pop.

23:44.675 --> 23:46.051
"Okay, Pop."

23:46.510 --> 23:49.513
God, you are such a dramatic asshole.

23:51.557 --> 23:52.558
Yeah.

23:53.684 --> 23:54.810
-Dude.
-Got 'em, David.

23:54.893 --> 23:56.061
That hurts.

23:56.144 --> 23:59.106
They were playing hooky at an arcade
like truant schoolchildren.

23:59.189 --> 24:01.191
Wow. Busted.

24:01.275 --> 24:03.110
Hey, good job, Jo.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.444
Can we go back to work now?

24:04.528 --> 24:06.864
Hold on. Wait a minute. Brad actually
has a task he needs accomplished.

24:06.947 --> 24:08.031
Right, Brad?

24:09.575 --> 24:12.494
Dana, we're selling naming rights
to the coliseum for a million bucks.

24:12.578 --> 24:15.122
Just say whatever you want about it
on the stream. Doesn't matter.

24:15.205 --> 24:17.791
Some idiot's gonna buy it
and call it "King Shit's Fuck Town."

24:17.875 --> 24:19.168
Great. Got that, Dana?

24:20.002 --> 24:21.086
Sure, I guess.

24:21.170 --> 24:22.546
Good. So, off you go.

24:23.589 --> 24:25.299
-You too.
-I'm going.

24:27.718 --> 24:29.094
Guys. Come on. Circle up.

24:30.053 --> 24:31.138
Come on.

24:31.638 --> 24:33.974
Can I just say something?
I am really proud of us.

24:34.057 --> 24:36.518
We all accomplished
what we set out to do today.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.395
Jo, you assisted me beautifully.

24:38.729 --> 24:40.480
And, Brad, you powered through

24:40.564 --> 24:42.733
and did your job despite feeling like
your life is meaningless.

24:42.816 --> 24:45.235
As for myself,
I got you both across the finish line,

24:45.319 --> 24:47.779
and no one jumped headfirst
into a rock quarry.

24:48.197 --> 24:49.907
Right? That's a big deal for me.

24:49.990 --> 24:55.204
Plus, we have earned
our last bits of cookie.

24:58.624 --> 24:59.917
It's only two pieces.

25:01.627 --> 25:03.545
You know what? You guys have 'em.

25:04.630 --> 25:06.548
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

25:08.592 --> 25:09.801
There you go.

25:11.428 --> 25:12.679
Go ahead, take a bite.

25:16.183 --> 25:18.852
This is the most delicious thing
I've ever eaten in my entire life.

25:18.936 --> 25:21.438
Yeah. Something about the last one just...

25:22.105 --> 25:23.899
just really tastes so good.

25:25.776 --> 25:26.902
Brad.

25:27.319 --> 25:30.030
I found out who bought
that overpriced sword thingy of yours.

25:30.113 --> 25:31.281
It wasn't a Saudi prince.

25:31.365 --> 25:34.326
It was some old guy who lives
in a trailer park or something. Crazy.

25:34.409 --> 25:35.994
Wait. Trailer park? How did he afford it?

25:36.370 --> 25:37.788
Must've been his life savings.

25:39.540 --> 25:41.124
Holy shit. That's it.

25:41.917 --> 25:44.962
Okay, it's not about taking
a million dollars from a billionaire.

25:45.045 --> 25:48.465
It's about taking that last piece of
cookie from a man who has nothing else.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.883
I wouldn't say nothing.

25:49.967 --> 25:52.219
It's about taking
our players' last dollar. No, last penny.

25:52.302 --> 25:55.722
No, last fraction of a penny.
Micro-microtransactions.

25:55.806 --> 25:59.059
Wait, nano-transactions. No one's safe,
no matter how poor they are.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.686
That is why I do this.

26:01.478 --> 26:02.980
Thank you, D-man.

26:03.063 --> 26:04.439
That's not the lesson.

26:04.940 --> 26:06.859
Hey. Why'd you throw that away?

26:07.317 --> 26:09.152
I ain't gonna eat that piece of shit.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.119
You just got that out of the trash.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.413
I sure did, boss.

26:23.333 --> 26:25.127
-Thanks, Jo.
-It's no problem.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.688
Look at you. Where you been?

26:44.771 --> 26:47.191
Strangling the light
out of someone's eyes?

26:47.941 --> 26:48.984
You know what, Lou?

26:49.067 --> 26:50.777
Say whatever bullshit you want, man.

26:51.904 --> 26:53.989
Because nothing is going to ruin my day.

26:54.531 --> 26:55.991
Oh, my God!

26:56.909 --> 26:58.327
Wyld_D.

26:59.328 --> 27:02.956
And I just got back from playing
some of my favorite old-school games

27:03.040 --> 27:04.499
at an actual arcade.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.961
Now, y'all know I love the new stuff,

27:08.045 --> 27:10.297
but sometimes
you gotta go back to the classics

27:10.380 --> 27:13.008
to really understand
what they mean to you.

27:13.091 --> 27:15.469
Let's dive back
into the Shadow Wolf dungeon, shall we?

27:16.094 --> 27:18.347
And I'm also taking requests
for any spell combos.

27:18.430 --> 27:19.681
So, hit me up in the chat.

27:21.850 --> 27:24.228
"Another fake gamer girl."

27:25.604 --> 27:28.190
Okay, I'm just gonna ignore the haters.

27:28.607 --> 27:29.733
Bye, haters.

27:30.901 --> 27:33.028
"This bitch works for Mythic Quest."

27:35.322 --> 27:36.573
What's happening?

27:36.657 --> 27:39.076
Why is her chat getting spammed by trolls?

27:39.159 --> 27:41.286
Guys, I'm not a fake gamer.

27:41.370 --> 27:43.914
I love video games more than anything.

27:44.373 --> 27:48.585
They pegged your girl as a plant.
She's toast.

27:48.669 --> 27:53.507
Okay, now that's just rude and racist.
You kiss your mama with that mouth?

27:53.590 --> 27:55.467
Well, good thing
nothing can ruin your day.

28:08.355 --> 28:09.356
Are you coming?

28:10.107 --> 28:11.108
No.

28:12.609 --> 28:15.696
You're just gonna sit in the car
like a child?

28:17.614 --> 28:18.615
I guess.

28:18.699 --> 28:20.617
You know what,
I'm glad that I'm going to Cold Alliance

28:20.701 --> 28:23.871
because at least there I'll have a voice,
and they're gonna serve my vision.

28:24.288 --> 28:26.790
And maybe they're gonna have to feed it
through an algorithm,

28:26.874 --> 28:29.418
but at least I'm not gonna be
breaking out in hives

28:29.501 --> 28:31.003
and have a pit in my stomach

28:31.086 --> 28:34.214
wondering what kind of messed up shit
this place is gonna throw at me next.

28:42.306 --> 28:44.641
Hey. Hey, Dan the man.

28:44.725 --> 28:47.644
It's Poppy, the creative director.

28:47.728 --> 28:50.772
What up? Can't wait to see you
in a couple of weeks.

28:51.273 --> 28:55.110
Listen, Poppy,
I don't think this is gonna work out.

28:55.194 --> 28:57.070
I really respect your talent,

28:57.529 --> 29:02.951
but I'm afraid your artistic temperament
isn't a fit for our studio.

29:03.035 --> 29:06.914
No. No, no, because I'm actually not...

29:07.998 --> 29:09.166
not that artistic.

29:09.249 --> 29:10.834
Some people call me a mechanic.

29:10.918 --> 29:13.295
I'm actually... I'm very levelheaded.

29:13.378 --> 29:15.255
You gotta trust me, Dan. I'm...

29:16.215 --> 29:18.342
I'm the grounded one around here.

29:18.425 --> 29:20.469
I'm sorry, Poppy. Good-bye.

29:24.181 --> 29:25.390
Shit.

29:26.975 --> 29:28.477
-Hey, Pop.
-Oh, my God.

29:29.728 --> 29:32.981
I heard everything. That sucks.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.360
Well, see you inside.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.631
I met his Chinese girlfriend.

29:58.048 --> 30:00.551
Wow. That's really racist, Mom.

30:00.968 --> 30:04.179
Unless she was actually Chinese,
but knowing you, she wasn't.

30:04.596 --> 30:06.431
Did you at least mention I was dating?

30:07.933 --> 30:10.102
Yeah. In the middle of meeting
my estranged father,

30:10.185 --> 30:13.188
I mentioned the fact that
you were getting plowed by random dudes.

30:13.730 --> 30:16.400
Christ, I can't wait
till I get my learner's permit.

30:19.695 --> 30:21.572
You want some chicken nuggets, sweetie?

30:23.699 --> 30:24.741
Yeah.

30:25.951 --> 30:27.077
Me too.
