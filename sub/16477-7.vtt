WEBVTT

00:03.704 --> 00:05.273
MAN:
All right, so watch your step.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.407
(laughing)
WOMAN:
Where are we?

00:06.440 --> 00:08.209
Oh, you are gonna love this!

00:08.242 --> 00:10.044
Oh.
All right. Oh, turn,
turn, turn, turn, turn.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.512
Yeah, I got you.
(laughs)
Okay, okay.

00:11.545 --> 00:14.048
And, ah...

00:14.082 --> 00:16.450
Are you ready

00:16.484 --> 00:18.686
to have your mind blown

00:18.719 --> 00:22.423
by the awesomeness that is
surrounding you right now?

00:23.324 --> 00:26.694
Oh.

00:26.727 --> 00:29.797
No way!

00:29.830 --> 00:33.567
Nathan Roberts, are you
recreating our first date?

00:33.601 --> 00:36.337
Happy Aluminum
Anniversary, baby.

00:36.370 --> 00:39.640
You are one of a kind.

00:41.475 --> 00:43.277
Thank you.

00:43.311 --> 00:45.279
Well, come on. We don't
have a lot of time.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.447
All right.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.082
(chuckling):
All right, okay.

00:48.116 --> 00:50.484
Wait until you see what
I got planned next.
Oh.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.486
(laughing)

00:53.687 --> 00:56.157
Hello?

00:56.190 --> 00:58.726
Let's just leave
the money on the counter.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.461
Yeah, but I-I don't
have any change.

01:00.494 --> 01:02.263
Hello?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.698
Hey, we just want
to pay for the...

01:06.534 --> 01:08.068
(gasps)

01:12.373 --> 01:13.574
Oh, my God.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.842
He's dead.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.547
*

01:48.809 --> 01:50.278
Hello?

01:53.947 --> 01:56.384
Oh.

01:56.417 --> 01:58.552
How you girls doing?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.421
You hungry this morning?

02:00.454 --> 02:03.357
Wait. He called
you here, too?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.792
Hey. Yeah. What's, uh, going on?

02:04.825 --> 02:06.427
BISHOP:
No idea.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.828
He said he'd tell us everything
when he got here.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.463
ABBY:
The suspense is killing me,

02:09.497 --> 02:10.531
like, literally.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.500
A fortune teller
told me once

02:12.533 --> 02:14.635
that I would die of suspense,
so this is dangerous.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.205
Welcome...

02:17.238 --> 02:19.340
beautiful people of NCIS!

02:19.373 --> 02:20.441
Senior!

02:20.474 --> 02:22.943
Ah, let's go! Bring it in. Oh.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.879
It's so good to see you.
How you been?

02:25.913 --> 02:28.516
It's been too long.
What'd you call
us all here for?

02:28.549 --> 02:30.418
Is it about Tony?
I know we've been

02:30.451 --> 02:31.652
talking about trying
to visit him lately.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.954
Well, I'm going
to be joining Junior

02:33.987 --> 02:37.791
and my beautiful granddaughter
for Christmas.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.627
They're having
such a blast in Paris,

02:39.660 --> 02:41.529
they've decided
to stay indefinitely.

02:41.562 --> 02:43.497
Yeah, we heard.
We're so happy for them.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.200
I'm still feeling
a lot of suspense here.

02:46.234 --> 02:47.701
Oh, forgive me, Abby.

02:47.735 --> 02:51.472
Uh, I, uh, asked you all to come
here because I have big news.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.342
Junior has decided
to lease his apartment,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.211
and he's asked me
to act as his landlord.

02:57.245 --> 02:59.480
A Mr. Roper, but with class.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.716
Wait. So this place
is available?
Uh-huh.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.652
How much is the rent?
Oh, it's very reasonable,

03:04.685 --> 03:07.888
but, uh,
there is one catch. Uh...

03:07.921 --> 03:11.559
fish don't, uh,
travel well across the pond.

03:11.592 --> 03:14.628
Oh, I will be
the best fish mom.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.497
(laughs)
Uh, really, Abby?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.633
Because growing up, they
called me "The Fish Whisperer."

03:19.667 --> 03:20.368
They did not.
They did.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.235
No, they did not.
They did.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.003
No. They did not.
They did.
Uh...

03:23.036 --> 03:24.272
They did.

03:24.305 --> 03:25.839
I, uh... I was thinking

03:25.873 --> 03:29.477
that before I took out an ad,
I'd check with the family.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.611
Are any of
you interested?
ALL:
I am.

03:30.644 --> 03:31.945
Wow.

03:31.979 --> 03:33.747
Any chance
of you sharing the place?

03:33.781 --> 03:34.748
ALL:
No.

03:34.782 --> 03:35.949
Ah.
(phone ringing)

03:35.983 --> 03:38.519
Excuse me. Yeah.

03:39.820 --> 03:41.555
Uh, yeah, Bishop's with me
right here.

03:41.589 --> 03:42.623
All right,
we're on our way.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.393
Dead sailor
on Tate Street.

03:45.426 --> 03:46.927
ABBY:
Well,

03:46.960 --> 03:49.530
my work doesn't start
until after the crime scene,

03:49.563 --> 03:51.632
so you and me-- we could
go get a Caf-POW! and talk.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.867
Uh, Abby, Gibbs said
to get your butt in the lab.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.337
Got to go.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.406
Okay. I'll see you later.

03:58.439 --> 04:01.008
Uh, maybe we could reach a nice

04:01.041 --> 04:02.310
group decision?

04:07.681 --> 04:10.384
Come on, Bishop, you've barely
been in your apartment a year.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.052
Yeah, but for that rent
in Dupont Circle,

04:12.085 --> 04:14.288
I would break my lease
in a heartbeat.

04:14.322 --> 04:16.857
I don't care how nice
the apartment is.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.627
You couldn't pay me enough
to pack my life up again.

04:19.660 --> 04:20.861
What nice apartment?

04:20.894 --> 04:22.930
I've been looking for weeks.

04:22.963 --> 04:26.334
Hey, guys, what nice apartment?

04:28.369 --> 04:29.570
GIBBS:
Duck and Palmer
hit traffic.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.539
What do we know?
Victim is Seaman

04:31.572 --> 04:32.940
Troy Willis. He's 23.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.775
Worked in the
security department

04:34.808 --> 04:37.478
at the Navy Yard. He lives
a few blocks from here.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.747
Got a nine-millimeter
shell casing here, boss.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.516
And a footprint.
It's faint, but pretty clean.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.719
Find out who that belongs to.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.788
There's a security camera, but
it's pointed at the register.

04:47.821 --> 04:51.492
It's out of the range of the
body, but I'm sure if we looked

04:51.525 --> 04:52.793
at it, we'll find something
on the footage.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.628
McGEE:
Store owner is on his way here,

04:54.662 --> 04:57.798
and once he gets here,
we'll get the footage.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.338
What?
What?

05:04.372 --> 05:06.774
What are you looking at me for?
Nothing.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.047
What?

05:14.081 --> 05:15.916
So you were the first one
on the scene?
Yes.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.585
Conducted a field interview.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.887
But I see your people
are doing the same.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.989
Yeah, but it helps
to compare notes.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.057
Right. Armed robber entered.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.894
Seaman Willis was a customer
who got shot trying to stop him.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.696
They remember anything
about the shooter?

05:28.729 --> 05:30.030
Those two? No.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.699
They walked in
after the incident.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.702
Everything we know came
from an account given to 911.

05:34.735 --> 05:35.936
Who made the call?

05:35.969 --> 05:37.405
An employee working
the night shift.

05:37.438 --> 05:38.672
Uh, name is
Victor Medina.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.708
The couple tried to stop him
from leaving,

05:40.741 --> 05:42.776
but he bolted right before
the EMTs showed up.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.077
The guy is M.I.A.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.380
They said
Medina had blood on his hands.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.948
Stopped in the back
office on his way out.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.917
Hey, door's locked.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.420
When the owner gets here,
we'll have him open it.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.662
There's blood on the shelf.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.799
Maybe where he got
the towel from.

06:05.833 --> 06:08.702
Medina told 911
this was a robbery gone bad.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.572
TORRES:
But then why did he
clean himself and run?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.043
He has something to hide?

06:26.086 --> 06:28.088
McGEE:
All right, Gibbs is

06:28.121 --> 06:29.423
gonna be here any minute.
We ready with the update?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.525
BOLO's out on Victor Medina, and

06:31.559 --> 06:34.562
Quinn is doing
general background.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.735
(whistles)

06:41.769 --> 06:43.170
TORRES:
Alex Quinn.

06:43.203 --> 06:45.172
What?
McGEE:
Quinn, you okay?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.541
You've been looking at Gibbs
weird all day,

06:47.575 --> 06:49.610
and now you're looking
at Gibbs' desk weird.

06:49.643 --> 06:51.845
(laughing):
No.

06:51.879 --> 06:54.448
It's my subconscious--

06:54.482 --> 06:57.551
it cracks me up sometimes.

06:57.585 --> 06:59.753
Yeah.

06:59.787 --> 07:03.991
I-I had a-a dream
about Gibbs last night.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.859
Oh, I totally
get it.

07:05.893 --> 07:08.829
Was it the one where he
tells you to grab your gear,

07:08.862 --> 07:11.699
and then, your gear is gone?
No.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.200
McGEE:
Wait. Is it the one

07:13.233 --> 07:15.503
where he cooks you a steak,
but it's raw inside,

07:15.536 --> 07:17.838
but you eat it anyway because
he's staring at you?
No.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.173
Not that kind of dream.
Oh.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.511
Oh.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.211
TORRES:
Oh.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.713
Oh.
Ooh.

07:25.746 --> 07:27.548
Oh, it's like
sexy things were happening?

07:27.581 --> 07:29.483
Yes, you could say that.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.251
I need details.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.721
I don't think
I want to know.
Oh, I want to know.

07:33.754 --> 07:35.255
I actually do want
to know very much.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.190
QUINN:
It started so innocent.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.859
I was sitting here,
I was working.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.829
He was there,
and he comes over my desk,

07:41.862 --> 07:45.265
and he knocks on it
like this, and says,

07:45.298 --> 07:48.602
"Do you know what kind
of wood that is?"

07:48.636 --> 07:50.704
But the desks
are Formica.
(Bishop scoffs)

07:50.738 --> 07:53.173
It was a dream, Tim.
Let the woman finish!

07:53.206 --> 07:54.908
Come on, come on.
Just get to the sexy part.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.510
That's when it got crazy.

07:56.544 --> 07:58.245
GIBBS:
Give me an update.

07:58.278 --> 07:59.980
Let's go.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.715
(clears her throat)

08:01.749 --> 08:04.051
Uh, our missing
liquor store attendant

08:04.084 --> 08:06.086
is Victor Medina,
32 years old.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.723
Yeah, he used
to be a Marine.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.291
And will always be.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.527
Medina received
a Silver Star

08:13.561 --> 08:15.963
for his actions during
an ambush in Afghanistan.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.565
He also did a tour in Iraq.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.166
Honorably discharged in '06.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.001
Four months later,
he got into a bar fight.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.603
He was convicted of assault,

08:22.636 --> 08:24.605
sentenced to a year,
served six months.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.273
Stayed clean ever since.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.776
According to Medina,
our victim, Seaman Willis,

08:28.809 --> 08:30.277
was shot by a robber.
QUINN:
Medina told

08:30.310 --> 08:33.013
911 that the shooter was wearing
a mask and driving

08:33.046 --> 08:35.983
a white sports car.

08:36.016 --> 08:38.318
But the blood and the weapon
we found in the office,

08:38.351 --> 08:40.554
plus the fact that
Medina fled the scene....

08:40.588 --> 08:43.691
That makes his story
sound like B.S.

08:43.724 --> 08:45.626
Weapon?

08:45.659 --> 08:47.327
Uh, Abby's got it, along with
the slug and the casing.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.962
She's running ballistics.

08:48.996 --> 08:52.332
Boss, Medina is a Marine,
uh, victim's Navy.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.001
There could be a connection.
Yeah, look into it.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.869
BISHOP:
BOLO paid off.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.571
Pennsylvania State
Police picked up Medina

08:57.605 --> 08:59.172
at a bus station
in Bedford County.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.641
Yeah, go. Take Torres with you.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.277
DUCKY
To sleep,

09:04.311 --> 09:06.313
perchance to dream.

09:06.346 --> 09:08.882
Ay, there's the rub.

09:08.916 --> 09:13.053
For in that sleep
of death what dreams may come

09:13.086 --> 09:17.758
when we have shuffled off this
mortal coil, must give us pause.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.292
Ducky?

09:19.326 --> 09:20.861
Ah, Alex.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.362
I was just having a chat

09:22.395 --> 09:27.234
with Seaman Willis here about
the significance of dreams.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.969
You've heard?

09:29.002 --> 09:29.903
Heard what?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.605
Uh, Alex

09:31.639 --> 09:35.108
uh, had an imaginative dream
about our Jethro.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.645
JIMMY (laughing):
Oh. I totally get it.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.079
Is it the one
where he knocks on your desk

09:39.112 --> 09:41.348
and asks what kind
of wood it is?

09:41.381 --> 09:44.317
How on earth did you know that?

09:44.351 --> 09:46.687
Oh, come on.
Look at the man.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.355
If you haven't had
the wood dream about Gibbs,

09:48.388 --> 09:52.059
you are not alive, am I right?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.728
Yeah, let's move on, shall we?
I already have.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.396
DUCKY:
Yes, well, the cause
of death is a single

09:56.429 --> 09:59.066
gunshot wound
that nicked his aorta.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.234
He simply bled out, and

10:01.268 --> 10:03.771
these contusions--
they suggest a struggle.

10:03.804 --> 10:05.372
He's also broken
several ribs here.
Mm.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.107
Must have been one hell
of a fight.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.342
DUCKY:
No, no, no,
you-you misunderstand.

10:09.376 --> 10:12.412
These rib injuries are
consistent with someone

10:12.445 --> 10:14.114
doing CPR properly.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.016
Someone struggled
to keep him alive.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.351
Well, Victor Medina
was the only one there

10:18.385 --> 10:20.287
immediately after the shooting.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.956
DUCKY:
Well, if Medina was trying
to save this young man's life,

10:22.990 --> 10:26.359
that would also explain how he
came to have blood on his hands.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.263
The nine-millimeter
that you found

10:30.297 --> 10:32.099
is definitely the murder weapon.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.101
It's unregistered, there's no
matches in the system,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.669
there's no prints.

10:35.703 --> 10:36.870
The bullet is interesting.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.972
It's Swiss-made,
enhanced accuracy.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.042
Moving on.
Abbs, you okay?

10:42.075 --> 10:43.410
Yeah, I just want to get through
this so you guys can leave.

10:43.443 --> 10:45.779
Trying to get rid of us?
(clinking)

10:46.714 --> 10:48.716
Swiss bullet. Moving on.

10:48.749 --> 10:51.685
This is the footage
from the store's security camera

10:51.719 --> 10:53.153
immediately
following the shooting.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.055
It shows the activity
at the counter.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.056
There's nothing there.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.290
ABBY:
Oh, yes, there is.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.458
There's a light

10:58.491 --> 10:59.426
that hits the counter.

10:59.459 --> 11:00.961
Once...

11:01.795 --> 11:02.796
...twice--

11:02.830 --> 11:04.865
wait for it--
three times.

11:04.898 --> 11:06.800
What does that tell us?

11:06.834 --> 11:08.802
There's a lit sign
on the front door.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.270
So every time the door
is opened,

11:10.303 --> 11:12.405
the light from the sign
hits the counter.

11:12.439 --> 11:13.807
That door was opened three times

11:13.841 --> 11:15.776
immediately following
the shooting.

11:15.809 --> 11:18.045
Medina said there was only one
robber fleeing the scene.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.479
ABBY: Exactly.
So, is he lying?

11:19.512 --> 11:20.748
Or were there
more people there

11:20.781 --> 11:22.382
than he told 911?

11:22.415 --> 11:24.484
These are the kind of
questions that you should be

11:24.517 --> 11:26.920
asking yourselves
somewhere other than here.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.289
Oh, one more thing.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.392
I also enhanced the footprint
at the crime scene.

11:32.425 --> 11:33.794
Looks like part
of a brand name.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.796
ABBY: Yeah.
It was etched in by hand.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.965
These puppies are
handmade and expensive.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.266
You make out the name?
No.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.334
But I will find
that out. Good-bye.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.269
Abigail,

11:42.302 --> 11:43.303
here I am,
as promised.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.105
Ah,

11:45.138 --> 11:46.740
McGee,
what a nice surprise.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.776
Gibbs.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.177
Ah.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.312
How are you?
Chief, what are you doing here?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.815
Wait a second, that's why
you're trying to get rid of us--

11:54.848 --> 11:57.785
so I wouldn't see you buttering
up Senior about the apartment.

11:57.818 --> 11:58.852
ABBY:
How dare you.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.153
Senior is here to help me

12:00.187 --> 12:01.755
track down this shoe brand.

12:01.789 --> 12:03.156
I do have
superior knowledge

12:03.190 --> 12:05.225
of, uh, luxury footwear.

12:05.258 --> 12:08.495
Since when do you need help
tracking down anything, Abby?

12:08.528 --> 12:10.363
I can't even look at you
right now.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.233
Senior,
I trust you

12:13.266 --> 12:14.868
to make the right choice.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.204
ABBY:
McGee!

12:17.237 --> 12:18.806
You've seen my apartment!
It's so tiny

12:18.839 --> 12:20.874
I barely have room
for my dog collars!

12:20.908 --> 12:22.075
Apartment thing's
a minefield.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.510
How you gonna decide
who gets it?

12:23.543 --> 12:24.544
I was hoping you would have

12:24.577 --> 12:26.113
some words of wisdom.

12:26.146 --> 12:27.981
Nope.

12:32.219 --> 12:34.454
BISHOP:
Abby did what?

12:34.487 --> 12:36.223
Well, is it working?

12:36.256 --> 12:38.826
Okay, thanks, McGee.
Yeah, keep me posted.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.461
(sighs)
Abby's playing dirty.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.930
But McGee's no better.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.564
He'd crawl through
a sewer to get that place.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.399
Let me ask you a question,
how does one get in

12:46.433 --> 12:47.801
on this apartment thing?

12:47.835 --> 12:50.838
Look, uh,

12:50.871 --> 12:53.306
I have to tell you, um,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.142
there was a murder
in that apartment.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.977
That's why Tony was able
to afford it.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.312
And I know how you feel
about dead bodies

12:59.346 --> 13:01.048
in potential
living spaces...

13:01.081 --> 13:04.151
Nick, it was a bloodbath.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.819
A bloodbath, huh?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.855
Well, for that kind of rent
in Dupont Circle,

13:07.888 --> 13:10.357
I, um... I'd get over it
pretty quick.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.859
CORNELL:
Agent Bishop,

13:11.892 --> 13:13.393
didn't think you were coming.

13:13.426 --> 13:14.828
To our own party?

13:14.862 --> 13:16.229
Well, state troopers
made it sound

13:16.263 --> 13:18.065
like you weren't available
for the transfer.

13:18.098 --> 13:19.867
So I came up from
D.C. to get him.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.069
I was just headed up front
to fill out the paperwork.

13:22.102 --> 13:23.904
Well, we're here, and we're
taking Medina into custody.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.038
I'll take you to him.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.540
Thanks.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.142
I was stocking shelves.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.610
Guy walked in with a mask,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.846
said he wanted the money
in the register.

13:32.880 --> 13:35.849
The sailor--

13:35.883 --> 13:37.885
he was right next to the guy.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.922
Wrong place, wrong time,
you know?

13:41.955 --> 13:43.590
What happened after that?

13:43.623 --> 13:45.625
Sailor charged
the guy.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.627
Before I could get to them,
I heard a gunshot.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.963
The shooter ran out.

13:49.997 --> 13:52.532
Surveillance shows the front
door opening three times.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.168
Yeah. I went out after him.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.170
Practically laid myself
on the hood of the car

13:57.204 --> 13:59.873
trying to stop him from leaving.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.909
He peeled off anyway.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.911
That's how you knew
it was a white sports car.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.913
Yeah.

14:05.946 --> 14:07.647
And after that,
you went back inside?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.416
I called 911.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.252
Then this couple walked into
the store, and I saw the weapon.

14:12.285 --> 14:14.654
You found it?
Yes.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.489
It slid under one
of the shelves.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.626
I locked it in the office
so no one else could get hurt.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.860
And then you left the scene.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.665
Victor, if what you're
telling us is true,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.400
what are you doing
in Pennsylvania?

14:31.004 --> 14:31.671
Boss,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.340
just talked
to Abby.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.642
She looked at photos
of Victor Medina's shoes.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.911
None of 'em match
our footprint.
Yeah,

14:37.945 --> 14:39.146
different size,
different tread.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.548
And we had a witness
from across the street

14:41.581 --> 14:43.016
from the liquor store
come forward.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.517
They saw the robber
arrive and leave,

14:44.551 --> 14:47.354
wearing a mask, just
like Victor Medina said.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.990
Yeah, his story checks out.
Medina's telling the truth.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.993
MAN:
Special Agent Gibbs.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.595
Yeah.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.965
Officer Baldwin. Immigration.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.599
You issued a BOLO
for Victor Medina.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.701
He's a witness
to a murder, yeah.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.971
GIBBS:
Our murder.

15:04.004 --> 15:04.938
What do you want with him?

15:04.972 --> 15:06.306
I'm the reason he's running.

15:06.339 --> 15:08.141
As a witness
to your murder,

15:08.175 --> 15:10.377
he knew that you would dig
into his background,

15:10.410 --> 15:11.578
turn up his secret.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.679
What secret?

15:12.712 --> 15:14.381
Victor Medina has
squandered his right

15:14.414 --> 15:16.950
to be in
this country.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.018
I'm here to deport him.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.563
Victor Medina was
born in Mexico.

15:30.597 --> 15:34.567
One year later, his parents
moved the family here, legally.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.236
Father passed away.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.438
Mother continues to live here
on a green card.

15:38.471 --> 15:42.109
Medina needed a green card
to join the Marines.
Well, he had one.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.011
But, 2006,
he got out of the corps,

15:44.044 --> 15:47.080
committed a crime,
became deportable.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.348
For getting in a bar fight?

15:48.381 --> 15:50.283
Federal immigration
law, ma'am.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.719
One-year sentence made his
conviction an aggravated felony.

15:52.752 --> 15:56.389
Well, then tell me, sir,
why didn't you deport him then?

15:56.423 --> 15:58.325
Government agencies
don't always communicate

15:58.358 --> 16:00.060
as effectively
as we'd like.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.995
Your BOLO put him back
on our radar.

16:02.029 --> 16:04.664
Tell you what, this
makes zero sense.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.234
Kid signs up
to protect this country

16:07.267 --> 16:09.269
but doesn't apply
for citizenship?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.305
Well, back when Medina joined, a
lot of guys thought citizenship

16:12.339 --> 16:15.242
was automatic once they took
their oath of enlistment.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.177
These days, the
military makes a point

16:17.210 --> 16:18.578
of encouraging
them to apply,

16:18.611 --> 16:20.713
but...
Cases fall
through the cracks.

16:20.747 --> 16:25.185
Because nobody is perfect,
right?

16:25.218 --> 16:28.355
QUINN:
Officer Baldwin, we've cleared
Medina of this murder.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.390
He was on the ground
in Afghanistan

16:30.423 --> 16:33.693
in a United States uniform,
for God's sake.
Look,

16:33.726 --> 16:36.563
I'm doing my job, just like you.

16:36.596 --> 16:39.032
As soon as
he gets here,

16:39.066 --> 16:40.733
I'll need you
to transfer custody.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.772
Is there nothing we can do?

16:53.146 --> 16:54.814
Got it, boss. Yep.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.649
On it.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.418
What'd he say?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.320
Excuse me.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.289
Did the cops give you my stuff?

17:02.322 --> 17:03.756
Personal effects?
Yeah, we got 'em.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.792
Can I get my compass back?
No.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.828
We got to turn everything
over to Immigration

17:08.861 --> 17:10.363
when they take
custody.

17:10.397 --> 17:13.466
Hmm. Compass looks old.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.468
It was my dad's.

17:15.502 --> 17:18.338
Feels weird not having it
in my pocket.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.209
Damn.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.177
What's wrong?

17:24.211 --> 17:25.378
It's not pointing north.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.380
Cops must've dropped it
or something.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.349
I have a friend. She could
probably fix it for you.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.551
MEDINA:
Thanks.

17:34.421 --> 17:37.524
So, cops said
you were headed to Ohio.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.791
Pro Football Hall of Fame?

17:38.825 --> 17:40.360
My mom lives outside
of Youngstown.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.562
I knew how this
was gonna end.

17:42.595 --> 17:44.131
Just wanted to say good-bye.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.335
Nick,

17:48.368 --> 17:51.271
turn
the car around.
What?

17:51.304 --> 17:52.405
The man needs to see his mom.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.107
Are you crazy?

17:54.141 --> 17:54.874
That'll take all night.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.410
Gibbs told us to take our time

17:57.444 --> 17:59.646
and do some good.
That's why he called.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.514
I am not going to Ohio.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.551
Well, darn it.

18:04.584 --> 18:07.554
(clicks tongue)
Really sucks for you,

18:07.587 --> 18:12.759
because I just got
the urge to sing.

18:12.792 --> 18:16.363
* She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain when she comes *
Okay, you promised

18:16.396 --> 18:17.330
you weren't gonna sing
in the car anymore.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.832
I'm not stopping
until you turn the car around.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.635
* She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain when she comes *

18:22.669 --> 18:24.637
Come on, Victor.
BOTH: * She'll be comin'
'round the mountain *

18:24.671 --> 18:26.539
* She'll be comin' 'round the
mountain *
Really?

18:26.573 --> 18:27.907
* She'll be comin' 'round
Now both of you are singing?

18:27.940 --> 18:29.909
* The mountain when she comes

18:29.942 --> 18:32.412
* She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain when she comes *

18:32.445 --> 18:34.614
* She'll be comin' 'round
the mountain, she'll be comin' *

18:34.647 --> 18:36.549
* 'Round
the mountain... *
All right, all right, all right!

18:36.583 --> 18:38.185
All right, I'm turning around.
I'm doing it.

18:38.218 --> 18:40.687
Just stop singing.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.589
All right, got it.

18:44.191 --> 18:47.160
You know, um, Tim,

18:47.194 --> 18:48.928
until we come
to a group decision,

18:48.961 --> 18:51.564
I don't know if it's right
for you to be in here.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.500
I'm just getting some specs
for Delilah and I

18:53.533 --> 18:55.535
in case we're lucky enough
to get the place.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.438
We've got to get
this group meeting on the books.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.942
You know, Mr. DiNozzo,
I was gonna tell you,

19:02.975 --> 19:05.545
I don't think anyone is gonna
willingly give this place up.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.914
Think you're gonna have
to make a decision.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.316
Which reminds me,
there's something

19:09.349 --> 19:10.583
I wanted to tell you about.

19:10.617 --> 19:11.851
Oh. What is it?

19:11.884 --> 19:13.553
I finally proposed to Delilah.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.522
Oh. You did?

19:15.555 --> 19:18.891
I did. It was... it was epic.
It was amazing, you know?

19:18.925 --> 19:21.294
My-my beautiful girlfriend
is now my beautiful fiancée.

19:21.328 --> 19:24.297
Oh.
Let me show you this, too.

19:24.331 --> 19:28.601
Oh. I'm-I'm over the moon
for you, Tim.

19:28.635 --> 19:32.239
Aw. This album is wonderful.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.607
Kind of a photographic
journey of our love story.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.876
It's a story
that I think could really...

19:36.909 --> 19:38.911
really bloom in this apartment.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.517
What are you doing?

19:44.551 --> 19:45.785
Changing the subject.

19:47.854 --> 19:50.757
(sighs)
Cassano.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.361
That's the brand of shoe
that made your bloody footprint.

19:54.394 --> 19:55.928
How do you know this?

19:55.962 --> 19:58.265
I confirmed it
with my shoe broker.

19:58.298 --> 20:01.501
Cassanos are rare,
Italian, and handmade.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.470
Everything a man could want
on his feet.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.638
All right, well,
I'll get that to Abby.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.640
And I am
just gonna leave this

20:07.674 --> 20:08.775
right here.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.678
In case you want to take a peek
at that for any reason.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.849
Abbs, what are you doing?

20:16.883 --> 20:20.653
I'm getting a neodymium
magnet for repolarization.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.656
For the what?
Um, this is
an old PC hard drive.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.958
And inside of it
is a very strong magnet

20:25.992 --> 20:29.462
called a rare-earth magnet.

20:29.496 --> 20:30.830
When Victor
gets back,

20:30.863 --> 20:32.465
I'm gonna get his compass
from him,

20:32.499 --> 20:33.600
and I'm gonna use this
to fix it.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.568
That is, before

20:35.602 --> 20:38.471
ICE swoops in and takes him away
like some angry pelican.

20:38.505 --> 20:40.973
(phone rings)

20:41.007 --> 20:42.675
Ah, speak of the devil.

20:42.709 --> 20:43.810
Well, I'm glad you ignored that

20:43.843 --> 20:45.545
because we have things
to talk about.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.615
Victor isn't the only
decorated veteran

20:48.648 --> 20:50.450
to face deportation.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.653
This is Hector Barajas.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.589
He's an Army vet
that was deported in 2004.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.726
He started a support house
for other deported veterans

20:59.759 --> 21:01.561
in Tijuana.
Yeah,

21:01.594 --> 21:03.062
called the Bunker.
You know about it?

21:03.095 --> 21:04.564
Yeah, I know about it.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.666
Gibbs, some of these
deportable crimes,

21:06.699 --> 21:07.867
they're so minor. And these guys

21:07.900 --> 21:11.037
are not even offered
an immigration attorney.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.507
And they have lives and
families and children here...
Abbs,

21:14.541 --> 21:15.942
I'm agreeing with you.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.411
Yeah.

21:18.445 --> 21:21.548
Okay, this is really sad.
Let's talk footwear.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.950
Thanks to Senior, we know
that this brand of shoe

21:23.983 --> 21:25.752
is called Cassano.

21:25.785 --> 21:26.886
I've never heard of that.

21:26.919 --> 21:28.588
It's a rare breed.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.890
It's only sold in two shops
in the area.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.626
So I cross-referenced people
who bought Cassanos

21:33.660 --> 21:36.496
with people who own
white sports cars, and...

21:36.529 --> 21:37.564
(keys clack)

21:37.597 --> 21:40.467
And you got a list of suspects.
Yep.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.602
Three, to be exact.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.471
I'll send them to you.
Great work, Abbs.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.706
Get them to Quinn
and McGee.

21:59.118 --> 22:00.687
Mijo.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.622
I can't believe
you're here!

22:02.655 --> 22:03.923
Look at you.

22:03.956 --> 22:04.924
(Medina laughs)
Hi, Ma.
Why didn't you come?

22:04.957 --> 22:06.659
We shouldn't stay long.

22:06.693 --> 22:09.696
I told you: Gibbs told us to
take our time and do some good.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.898
So, what, give him, like, ten,
15 minutes to say good-bye?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.900
(scoffs)
That's real compassionate, Nick.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.869
Well, we still have a case
to solve back home.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.474
Come in, come in.
Listen, Ma, I need

22:21.508 --> 22:22.942
to talk to you about something.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.378
Don't be rude, mijo.
Introduce me

22:25.412 --> 22:26.613
to your friends.
Ma...

22:26.646 --> 22:30.016
There's something
I got to tell you.

22:30.049 --> 22:31.884
I'm going away for a while.

22:31.918 --> 22:33.119
What?

22:33.152 --> 22:34.921
Victor, why?

22:34.954 --> 22:38.057
I, uh...

22:40.427 --> 22:41.928
He's deploying, ma'am.

22:41.961 --> 22:43.730
Deploying?

22:43.763 --> 22:45.798
I thought
you were

22:45.832 --> 22:46.933
out of the Marines.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.168
MEDINA:
I, uh...

22:49.201 --> 22:51.804
I was. They, uh...

22:51.838 --> 22:55.007
It's an advisory
position, uh...

22:55.041 --> 22:57.143
and your son is very
good at his job.

22:57.176 --> 23:00.413
We need him.
I'm Torres.

23:00.447 --> 23:03.182
I'm one of his recruiters. And
this is my colleague, Bishop.

23:03.215 --> 23:05.518
Where will you be taking him?

23:05.552 --> 23:07.386
Is it dangerous again?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.523
It's classified, ma'am.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.628
When will you be home?

23:17.797 --> 23:19.799
I don't know, Ma.

23:20.933 --> 23:22.168
My son.

23:22.201 --> 23:25.071
The brave Marine.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.709
Let me feed you before you go.

23:29.742 --> 23:31.678
Are you hungry?

23:31.711 --> 23:33.880
Actually, Mrs. Medina,
we have to...
We're starving.

23:38.117 --> 23:39.552
Nice house.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.753
Ooh. Yeah.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.656
A palace of a
luxury realtor.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.128
Quinn.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.830
Hmm?
What the hell is wrong with you?

23:50.863 --> 23:53.933
What? Nothing.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.869
McGee could use some help

23:56.903 --> 23:58.571
running down
those other two suspects.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.843
NCIS. We're here
to speak to Phillip Conway.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.079
Well.
Hello, Agent Mrs. Robinson.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.649
Oh, just go get your father.

24:13.653 --> 24:15.822
I know the shoes
you're talking about.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.123
Ill-fitting.

24:17.156 --> 24:20.126
I threw those out...

24:20.159 --> 24:21.861
must have been a year ago.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.796
We're gonna
need to see your car.

24:23.830 --> 24:26.733
The white sports
car, yes, yes.

24:26.766 --> 24:29.669
But like I said, I was hosting
a broker's open that night.

24:29.702 --> 24:33.506
Now, about that Swiss 9mm
ammo you asked about--

24:33.540 --> 24:35.107
I can't say for sure
if I have it,

24:35.141 --> 24:36.976
because I don't keep
a detailed inventory.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.645
An inventory?

24:38.678 --> 24:39.879
I'm a collector.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.889
All the drawers, cabinets you
see are filled with ammunition.

24:49.922 --> 24:51.724
Whoa.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.661
Well, you really
were not kidding.

24:54.694 --> 24:56.863
You know, I would
like to apologize to you

24:56.896 --> 24:59.932
for the way my son looked
at you when you walked in.

24:59.966 --> 25:02.769
I think he's got
a bit of a crush.
Oh...

25:02.802 --> 25:04.904
Uh, yeah, uh, well,
if you can just

25:04.937 --> 25:06.639
get us the, uh,
names of the brokers

25:06.673 --> 25:08.240
that might have seen you
at that open house.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.508
Of course.
Thank you. Okay.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.112
Can we hurry up? Rich
people creep me out.

25:13.145 --> 25:15.081
Do you know
what kind of wood this is?

25:16.616 --> 25:17.984
What?

25:19.351 --> 25:20.820
Do you know
what kind of wood this is?

25:22.321 --> 25:23.322
It's oak.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.957
Oh.

25:24.991 --> 25:28.194
Quinn, I said it was oak.
Yeah, it's oak.

25:31.263 --> 25:34.133
You were right, McGee
needs me. He needs m...

25:34.166 --> 25:35.668
So, you stay here.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.938
And I'm gonna go
work with McGee.

25:40.006 --> 25:42.675
What'd I say?

25:43.876 --> 25:45.812
QUINN:
McGee.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.980
Hey, I thought you
were with Gibbs.

25:48.014 --> 25:50.016
No. He started
knocking on some wood

25:50.049 --> 25:53.352
and I had to get out of there.
This is becoming distracting.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.688
What are you gonna do?
I don't know.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.957
Maybe I'll ask him to eat
some bologna with a fork.

25:57.990 --> 25:59.158
My ex-boyfriend
used to do that.

25:59.191 --> 26:00.593
Instant turn-off.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.361
Is this the place?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.931
Yeah. Hard to believe a guy
with fancy shoes

26:04.964 --> 26:06.933
and a sports car lives here.

26:06.966 --> 26:09.268
You know what, I think
that's him. Arthur Jankowski?

26:09.301 --> 26:11.303
NCIS. We need to
speak with you.

26:11.971 --> 26:14.040
Whoa, stop!

26:14.073 --> 26:15.307
He's not that fast.
We got him.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.683
Oh, no, we don't got him.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.126
Okay, what do we got?

26:34.160 --> 26:35.862
McGEE:
Well, boss,

26:35.895 --> 26:37.296
escapee
is Arthur Jankowski.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.365
Thought we had him,
but we were not prepared

26:39.398 --> 26:41.367
for the rocket ship with wheels
around the corner.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.102
QUINN:
Guy's a convicted
identity thief, but

26:43.135 --> 26:46.172
apparently three years in prison
didn't scare him straight.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.741
His latest victim
is quite the score.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.711
World-renowned author
Mason Moffett. Boss, this guy

26:51.744 --> 26:53.412
writes the most amazing
horror books.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.414
I swear, I read
Headstone Highway

26:55.447 --> 26:57.950
and I did not sleep right
for a month.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.186
Jankowski stole
Moffett's identity

27:00.219 --> 27:01.954
and started diverting
his royalty checks

27:01.988 --> 27:03.656
into hidden accounts.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.957
We searched
Jankowski's place.

27:04.991 --> 27:06.793
He's definitely
enjoying Moffett's money.

27:06.826 --> 27:07.827
Lot of high-end items.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.028
Like a laptop, and Abby's

27:09.061 --> 27:10.963
going through it now.
No Cassano shoes,

27:10.997 --> 27:12.965
but there's a good chance
that he's wearing 'em.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.934
So, and, uh,
what about you?

27:14.967 --> 27:16.669
Did you find anything
in the rich guy's gun room?

27:16.703 --> 27:19.405
No Swiss ammo.
And I searched those

27:19.438 --> 27:21.808
cabinets and drawers. By myself.

27:21.841 --> 27:24.143
Oh.
And his alibi--

27:24.176 --> 27:25.845
it checks.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.815
W... Uh, suspect
number three, boss.

27:28.848 --> 27:32.084
Number three, suspect number
three-- Howard Lane.

27:32.118 --> 27:35.121
He is a hedge fund manager
whose Cassanos were never worn.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.824
And he's got an airtight alibi
for the night of the shooting.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.325
Which brings
us back to...

27:39.358 --> 27:41.460
Jankowski. I like him for this.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.095
Well, good.
Then find him.

27:43.129 --> 27:44.831
Uh-huh.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.199
Agent Gibbs.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.169
We have phones, you know.

27:50.202 --> 27:53.172
Well, none of your people
seem to hear them ring.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.841
Where's Medina?

27:54.874 --> 27:55.875
Not back yet.

27:55.908 --> 27:58.077
I spoke to an Officer Cornell

27:58.110 --> 27:59.145
over at Metro.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.379
She said your people
picked him up

28:00.412 --> 28:02.081
in Bedford County
yesterday afternoon.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.482
Car trouble.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.018
The hell you trying to pull?

28:06.052 --> 28:09.822
When Medina gets back here,
you will be the first to know.

28:12.224 --> 28:13.259
We good?

28:13.292 --> 28:14.927
Yeah.

28:16.228 --> 28:17.396
No, no, no,

28:17.429 --> 28:19.031
my favorite thing in the world

28:19.065 --> 28:21.100
is cooking for people who eat.

28:21.133 --> 28:24.336
Well, that will go down as one
of the best meals of my life.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.774
Yeah, Ma, thank you.

28:27.807 --> 28:31.377
No, no, wait, wait, I will go
write down the recipe for you.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.045
That would literally
make my year.

28:33.079 --> 28:35.882
Yeah, the most my mom ever
cooked was a bowl of cereal,

28:35.915 --> 28:37.449
so, uh, this was...

28:37.483 --> 28:40.519
this was quite a treat.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.089
She's gonna ask us to stay
for coffee when she comes back.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.157
I wish we could.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.258
But one cup
of coffee

28:46.292 --> 28:47.493
never killed nobody.

28:47.526 --> 28:50.162
No, no, I...
I get it.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.032
You guys have been
so good to me.

28:53.065 --> 28:56.168
I just...

28:56.202 --> 28:58.871
I want you to know something.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.439
When I got in trouble--

29:00.472 --> 29:02.909
that bar fight--

29:02.942 --> 29:04.343
the guy was drunk.

29:04.376 --> 29:05.912
He was yelling
at his girlfriend,

29:05.945 --> 29:07.313
getting in her face.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.982
It wasn't right.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.451
I pulled him away...

29:12.484 --> 29:15.121
and it went from there.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.156
Afterwards,
they lied.

29:17.189 --> 29:18.457
Both of 'em.

29:18.490 --> 29:21.127
Said that I attacked him
out of nowhere.

29:21.160 --> 29:24.363
It was their word against mine.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.567
I know I got myself

29:28.600 --> 29:30.502
in trouble.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.038
But...

29:32.071 --> 29:34.073
I had a reason.

29:36.275 --> 29:39.011
Victor, there are
a lot of people

29:39.045 --> 29:41.147
who think what
you're facing isn't right.

29:41.180 --> 29:44.183
Us included.

29:44.216 --> 29:47.219
I haven't been to Mexico
since I was a baby.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.957
(laughs)

29:50.990 --> 29:53.325
Hell, I don't even
speak Spanish.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.404
What am I gonna do?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.339
Hey, man...

30:09.341 --> 30:11.543
...take your time with your mom.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.579
All right?

30:16.215 --> 30:18.350
I need to tell her the truth.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.429
Ma?

30:34.366 --> 30:36.135
"'Why I Should
Get the Apartment,'

30:36.168 --> 30:38.570
an essay by
Eleanor Bishop."

30:38.604 --> 30:41.207
She e-mailed me that
from the road.

30:41.240 --> 30:44.476
You know, I really care about
the three of you

30:44.510 --> 30:47.546
so deeply. So equally.

30:47.579 --> 30:50.049
Well, I admit that
it is well-written,

30:50.082 --> 30:52.351
but I totally disagree
with her thesis statement.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.286
Abby, my love,

30:54.320 --> 30:57.523
I came here to tell you that
I've decided to draw a name.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.192
It's the only fair way.

31:00.226 --> 31:02.895
Oh, my God. I'm so... lucky.

31:02.929 --> 31:04.196
I love drawings.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.032
I could-I could
find a hat.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.100
No, no, it's, uh... No need.

31:08.134 --> 31:11.237
I've already recruited
an impartial name drawer.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.072
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, so, Dr. Mallard

31:13.105 --> 31:15.674
has rules about not
using his hat for nonsense.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.476
And I feel like
this could be on the cusp,

31:17.509 --> 31:19.245
so we better do this quickly.

31:19.278 --> 31:21.280
I'm gonna write
down the names.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.249
ABBY:
Seriously, I can't
remember when I've

31:23.282 --> 31:24.583
entered a raffle
and I didn't win a prize.

31:24.616 --> 31:26.252
This is awesome.
Abbs.

31:26.285 --> 31:28.087
You working, you
hosting a party?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.655
I am waiting for a ding.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.224
So, McGee and Quinn

31:32.258 --> 31:34.060
were able to
pinpoint the

31:34.093 --> 31:36.662
exact time and location
when Jankowski sped off.

31:36.695 --> 31:38.564
Followed him with traffic cams.
Yeah.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.000
Um, I lost him
after these shots,

31:41.033 --> 31:42.468
but I input
his plate

31:42.501 --> 31:44.236
and his car stats
into a program

31:44.270 --> 31:46.238
that's accessing the live feed

31:46.272 --> 31:48.007
from cameras within...

31:48.040 --> 31:50.676
I got it, Abbs. You're
waiting for a ding.

31:50.709 --> 31:54.580
Exactly.
So, this is Jankowski's laptop.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.283
Not only did he steal
a famous author's identity,

31:57.316 --> 31:59.151
he wanted to be said author.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.353
I-I found all kinds
of really bad prose

32:01.387 --> 32:04.023
and I made you a few copies
of his memoir.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.958
Gibbs...

32:05.992 --> 32:07.193
I have to tell you,

32:07.226 --> 32:08.260
I met your new agent, Quinn,

32:08.294 --> 32:09.528
on my way in.

32:09.561 --> 32:12.264
Put a sparkle in my day.
I'll bet.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.665
(computer dings)

32:13.699 --> 32:16.335
My ding. Okay, got him.

32:16.368 --> 32:19.505
Jankowski is outside
the Moonbrite Motel

32:19.538 --> 32:22.041
on Wells Avenue in D.C.
Thanks, Abbs.

32:23.409 --> 32:25.011
All right. The winner

32:25.044 --> 32:28.414
of the best apartment
of anyone we know is...

32:32.051 --> 32:34.220
Torres.
What?!

32:34.253 --> 32:35.687
Who the heck is Torres?

32:35.721 --> 32:37.489
Look, I'm sorry
that I ran from you guys.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.159
But do I look like the kind of
person that would shoot someone?

32:40.192 --> 32:41.627
No. No, I don't.

32:41.660 --> 32:45.397
You want to know where
I was when it happened?

32:45.431 --> 32:48.767
I'll tell you, I was home
alone... brainstorming.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.304
That is the
worst alibi ever.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.306
You get to page 14 yet?

32:54.340 --> 32:56.342
Uh-uh.
JANKOWSKI:
Oh, come on, man.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.609
Haven't you ever heard
of a first draft?

32:57.643 --> 32:59.378
It's not ready
for public consumption.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.013
You're supposed
to ask permission

33:01.047 --> 33:02.081
before you just read
someone's memoir.

33:02.114 --> 33:03.249
You won't talk, how else

33:03.282 --> 33:04.183
are we gonna get to know you?

33:04.216 --> 33:06.552
QUINN: Well, we do know
something about him.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.420
I mean, it's supposed
to be a memoir,

33:08.454 --> 33:10.089
it's supposed to
be non-fiction.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.091
Half this stuff is B.S.

33:12.124 --> 33:13.592
GIBBS:
"Shielding that child

33:13.625 --> 33:17.763
"from the bear's fangs was,
dot, dot, dot,

33:17.796 --> 33:21.400
what anyone would've done."

33:21.433 --> 33:25.171
Did you just read
an ellipsis out loud?

33:25.204 --> 33:27.106
He wrote it.

33:27.139 --> 33:29.141
You're not supposed
to verbalize it.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.381
Gibbs.

33:35.414 --> 33:37.316
Quinn is driving me nuts.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.785
She's staring,
she left a search,

33:39.818 --> 33:42.521
now she's in there
talking about dots.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.091
Well, actually...
McGee, what do you want?

33:45.124 --> 33:48.260
Abby finished processing
Jankowski's shoes.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.728
They are Cassanos,

33:49.761 --> 33:50.762
but the wear pattern
on the bottom

33:50.796 --> 33:52.231
does not match our footprint.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.166
Not our guy.
Not our guy.

33:58.504 --> 33:59.605
Hey.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.073
This place is amazing.

34:01.107 --> 34:02.541
The bathroom smells
like blueberry pie.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.143
You ready?
Yeah, in a minute.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.844
We just ordered some coffee
for, uh, for the road.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.415
Oh. Uh, can you get me
a corn dog, too?

34:09.448 --> 34:11.550
Oh, hell, yeah.
Wow.

34:11.583 --> 34:13.552
(laughs)
I appreciate the support.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.387
No. I just got
a text from Jimmy.

34:15.421 --> 34:16.455
I got the apartment.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.856
What?
Congrats, man.

34:17.889 --> 34:19.258
Hey, thanks, man.
We got to celebrate.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.759
You know,
stop for a beer?

34:20.792 --> 34:23.562
I'm thinking up
a toast right now.
Let's do it.

34:23.595 --> 34:25.131
Uh...

34:26.832 --> 34:28.800
My mom again.

34:28.834 --> 34:31.303
Do you mind?

34:32.438 --> 34:33.572
Go for it.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.577
Hey, Mom.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.312
Um...

34:40.346 --> 34:41.713
What are you doing?

34:41.747 --> 34:43.882
Uh, Jimmy had a drawing
so I put my name down.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.485
No, I'm not talking
about the apartment.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.454
Oh, I'm not gonna drink.

34:48.487 --> 34:51.190
I just, I just thought it would
be nice to buy him a cold one

34:51.223 --> 34:52.658
before they toss him
over the border.

34:52.691 --> 34:54.826
He shouldn't even
have his phone.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.328
Why did you give it
back to him?

34:56.362 --> 34:57.529
He asked for it.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.400
I don't get it.
I could barely get you

35:01.433 --> 35:02.834
to turn the car around,

35:02.868 --> 35:04.270
and now...
And now I care?

35:04.303 --> 35:06.872
Yeah.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.574
Bishop, this is exactly

35:08.607 --> 35:10.376
why I didn't want to
turn the car around.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.744
I got to know him, I...

35:12.778 --> 35:14.380
(sighs)

35:14.413 --> 35:17.383
I looked in his
mother's face.

35:17.416 --> 35:18.817
I have friends like him.

35:18.850 --> 35:21.520
I have family like him.

35:23.655 --> 35:25.123
I could have been him.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.627
Look.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.762
We did a good thing for him,

35:30.796 --> 35:33.399
and now it's time for us
to do our jobs.

35:34.766 --> 35:36.835
I don't want to be the
one to turn him over.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.505
Nick...

35:43.809 --> 35:46.278
Gun!

35:46.312 --> 35:48.314
Get down, get down.
Move, move!

35:50.716 --> 35:52.150
Stop!

35:54.553 --> 35:55.687
Damn it.

36:01.593 --> 36:03.795
Stay inside, stay back.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.249
(grunting)

36:26.852 --> 36:28.587
BISHOP:
NCIS!

36:44.002 --> 36:46.705
A skillful shot indeed
from young Eleanor.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.540
Dead center of the heart.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.476
She and Torres
make quite a team.

36:50.509 --> 36:51.877
What do we know about this guy,
Ducky?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.379
JIMMY:
His name is Carl Dixon.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.381
He's a professional hit man
with a rap sheet

36:55.414 --> 36:56.815
about a mile long.

36:56.848 --> 37:00.286
He located Victor by
tracking down his cell phone.

37:00.319 --> 37:02.388
I go all that
from McGee.

37:02.421 --> 37:03.822
I was hovering.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.524
If he's a hit man,
who hired him?

37:05.557 --> 37:07.359
That's what they're trying
to figure out upstairs.

37:07.393 --> 37:08.294
Gibbs. I called you.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.529
Abbs, I was on my way.
Well, I can't wait.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.997
So, I was starting to
fix Victor's compass

37:12.030 --> 37:13.532
with my magnet,

37:13.565 --> 37:15.834
and this giant light bulb
went off in my head.

37:15.867 --> 37:19.004
So, Victor thought that
his compass was broken

37:19.037 --> 37:20.506
at the police station,
so I checked.

37:20.539 --> 37:21.907
And the cops said
that it was just sitting

37:21.940 --> 37:23.742
in an evidence bin
the whole time,

37:23.775 --> 37:26.445
and never came anywhere near
a magnetic field.

37:26.478 --> 37:28.847
Then why isn't it pointing
north?
Because...

37:28.880 --> 37:32.418
before that, it did come in
contact with rare-earth magnets,

37:32.451 --> 37:34.320
like mine,
only way bigger.

37:34.353 --> 37:36.322
The kind used in
electric car motors.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.523
Victor leaned over the car

37:37.556 --> 37:38.857
and stopped the
shooter from leaving.

37:38.890 --> 37:41.360
Yep. And when he did,
his compass was depolarized.

37:41.393 --> 37:45.664
Now, Gibbs, there's only
one of our three suspects

37:45.697 --> 37:48.434
that has a white sports car
that's an electric prototype

37:48.467 --> 37:51.537
with rare-earth magnets in it.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.639
Who is it?

37:53.672 --> 37:57.643
I already told you
I was hosting a broker's open.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.645
Didn't you speak
to any of the people

37:59.678 --> 38:01.780
on the list I gave you?

38:01.813 --> 38:03.349
Yeah.

38:03.382 --> 38:05.317
Your alibi is solid.

38:05.351 --> 38:07.486
Then why are you
wasting my time?

38:07.519 --> 38:08.720
BISHOP:
Mr. Conway,

38:08.754 --> 38:10.622
how would you
categorize your son?

38:10.656 --> 38:12.391
Excuse me?

38:12.424 --> 38:14.025
You pulled a lot
of expensive strings

38:14.059 --> 38:16.528
to make his record go away.

38:16.562 --> 38:18.997
I would categorize your son
as a bored rich kid,

38:19.030 --> 38:20.666
destroying property for kicks--

38:20.699 --> 38:23.569
only this time, he got bolder.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.538
Bored rich kid
robbing a liquor store.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.007
He probably didn't mean
to kill anyone,

38:29.040 --> 38:30.909
but things got a little
out of hand,

38:30.942 --> 38:33.712
and he knew his dad
would clean up after him.

38:33.745 --> 38:34.913
Same as always.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.882
But you were smart.

38:36.915 --> 38:38.884
You got rid of the shoes
he was wearing.

38:38.917 --> 38:40.619
Got rid of the ammo he used.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.560
That's a great story.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.362
It's not true.

38:50.396 --> 38:52.330
Name Carl Dixon ring a bell?

38:54.866 --> 38:55.667
No?

38:57.469 --> 38:58.770
'Cause he's the hit man
you hired

38:58.804 --> 39:00.972
to take out the only witness
to the murder.

39:01.006 --> 39:02.641
Carol Dixon's dead.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.810
We're tracking a payment
deposited into his account.

39:04.843 --> 39:07.479
And we're pretty sure it's
gonna lead right back to you.

39:09.815 --> 39:12.484
BRANDON:
You can't do this;
I want my phone call.

39:12.518 --> 39:14.553
I don't think your dad's gonna
be able to pick up.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.455
Well, just don't leave
my stuff in the driveway.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.757
The bags alone are worth
more than you two combined.

39:18.790 --> 39:21.026
You got a lot bigger problems
than luggage, kid.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.494
(scoffs)

39:22.528 --> 39:23.762
(door slams)

39:23.795 --> 39:25.531
You know, speaking
of big problems,

39:25.564 --> 39:26.998
I think Gibbs knows that
something's up with you.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.834
It doesn't matter,
I'm over it.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.101
Yeah?
Yes.

39:30.135 --> 39:33.171
He read an ellipsis out loud.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.272
"Dot, dot, dot."

39:34.305 --> 39:36.842
It's almost as good as eating
bologna with a fork.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.410
He read the dot, dot, dot
out loud?

39:38.444 --> 39:40.011
He read it out loud.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.481
I mean, my Uncle Larry
used to do that.

39:42.514 --> 39:45.050
And now, when I see Gibbs,
all I see is Uncle Larry.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.652
So, thank God.

39:46.685 --> 39:47.686
Well done.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.792
Tell your friend thanks
for fixing it, will you?

39:53.825 --> 39:54.993
Yeah, I will.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.698
My mom,

39:59.731 --> 40:02.000
she told me to never take
this country for granted.

40:02.033 --> 40:04.736
She said it all
the time. She said,

40:04.770 --> 40:08.574
"Home is a privilege."

40:08.607 --> 40:11.042
That's how I
always saw it.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.879
That's how I
still see it.

40:13.912 --> 40:15.647
(door opens)

40:15.681 --> 40:17.816
Victor.

40:17.849 --> 40:18.917
Special Agent Gibbs.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.719
I got a lawyer friend.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.822
I don't know if keeping you
home is a battle we can win,

40:23.855 --> 40:25.724
but I'd like to help you
fight it.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.760
These guys told me a lot about
you on the trip here, sir.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.133
The were right.

40:35.166 --> 40:38.103
You ready?

40:43.675 --> 40:45.577
Hey, Marine.

40:47.045 --> 40:48.480
Semper Fi.

40:48.514 --> 40:49.615
Semper Fi.

40:53.652 --> 40:56.522
(knocks on door)

40:57.723 --> 41:00.626
Yeah, it's open.

41:00.659 --> 41:01.927
Hey.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.563
Hey, just the man
I wanted to see.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.532
Hope you don't mind me
dropping by like this.

41:06.565 --> 41:09.167
Uh, I left that book
for, uh, Senior.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.603
Well, you know,
it's kind of embarrassing.

41:11.637 --> 41:13.004
Well, not as embarrassing

41:13.038 --> 41:14.973
as the apartment essay
that Bishop wrote.

41:15.006 --> 41:16.642
Oh, really?
Yeah.

41:16.675 --> 41:20.679
No, the book actually turned out
quite nice.

41:20.712 --> 41:23.582
Not bad at all. Thanks.

41:23.615 --> 41:24.983
I was gonna go home and, uh,

41:25.016 --> 41:27.653
show it to Delilah tonight,
you know?

41:27.686 --> 41:31.823
Also, if, uh, you need any help
with the surround sound wiring,

41:31.857 --> 41:34.726
glad to do that,
help you out here.

41:34.760 --> 41:36.995
I actually love doing
that stuff, so.
Oh.

41:38.964 --> 41:40.632
Hey, um...

41:40.666 --> 41:44.202
You know, um...

41:44.235 --> 41:48.039
when I joined this team...

41:48.073 --> 41:52.110
I thought, finally I'm going
to be a real good guy.

41:52.143 --> 41:57.616
You know, nobody really
sees me like that.

41:57.649 --> 42:01.152
But I actually like...

42:01.186 --> 42:02.688
I like doing what's right.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.624
(clears throat)

42:07.659 --> 42:09.260
(keys rattling)

42:09.294 --> 42:10.829
So...

42:13.865 --> 42:15.634
What are you doing?

42:15.667 --> 42:17.936
Home is a privilege.

42:17.969 --> 42:22.841
And, uh,
I'm not ready for it yet.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.113
But you are.

42:32.751 --> 42:33.852
(door opens)

42:33.885 --> 42:35.887
(door closes)
