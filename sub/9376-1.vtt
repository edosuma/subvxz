WEBVTT

00:29.704 --> 00:33.406
Everything is based in symbiosis.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.309
Givers and takers.

00:36.677 --> 00:41.715
God gave us life but then
he took it away with death.

00:42.951 --> 00:47.519
But now God doesn't exist anymore so...

00:47.521 --> 00:50.824
someone's gotta step up to the plate.

03:01.656 --> 03:03.322
Come on, it'll be fun.

03:03.324 --> 03:04.723
Nope.

03:04.725 --> 03:06.826
Sounds like the plot of a lame movie.

03:06.828 --> 03:09.995
"What happens when a guy names
Ned takes a hooker named Love

03:09.997 --> 03:12.330
"home to meet the parents?

03:12.332 --> 03:14.167
"This Thanksgiving the turkey ain't all

03:14.169 --> 03:16.369
"that's getting stuffed."

03:16.371 --> 03:17.870
You're not a hooker.

03:17.872 --> 03:20.205
And strippers are really dancers.

03:20.207 --> 03:22.774
By now my family probably thinks I'm gay.

03:22.776 --> 03:25.578
Well them thinking it doesn't
put a cock in your ass now,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.814
does it?

03:27.816 --> 03:29.482
No it doesn't.

03:29.484 --> 03:33.219
But you gotta admit, we're
getting pretty serious.

03:33.221 --> 03:34.519
You're just a regular.

03:34.521 --> 03:35.887
You don't charge me.

03:35.889 --> 03:39.758
I don't charge you
because you pay me anyway.

03:39.760 --> 03:43.161
Love, I love you.

03:43.163 --> 03:45.430
And I you, like a brother.

03:45.432 --> 03:48.034
Like a brother than I fuck.

03:58.246 --> 04:00.812
You know I'm only joking right?

04:00.814 --> 04:02.482
I know.

04:02.484 --> 04:04.049
That's what I love about you.

04:04.051 --> 04:07.455
I wanna joke with you every day like this.

04:09.424 --> 04:12.324
All right, I know enough
about how I feel about you,

04:12.326 --> 04:16.428
to know that this is it.

04:18.333 --> 04:21.868
It's what I now about
me that counts though.

04:21.870 --> 04:24.303
I've got to feel worth it.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.553
You beg for life.

05:13.555 --> 05:16.891
"Let me live! Let me live!"

05:17.992 --> 05:22.461
But day by day you feed on distraction.

05:22.463 --> 05:24.832
Prove me wrong.

05:25.867 --> 05:29.437
Life is not just existence.

05:33.408 --> 05:36.308
Which is more important?

05:36.310 --> 05:39.277
How we got here?

05:39.279 --> 05:42.647
What we're doing here?

05:42.649 --> 05:45.886
Or where we go when we leave?

05:49.690 --> 05:51.423
How'd you get here?

05:56.463 --> 05:58.630
You've been a naughty
little prince, haven't you?

05:58.632 --> 06:01.466
Yes you have.

06:01.468 --> 06:05.071
Knocked over Daddy's little Colt.

06:06.107 --> 06:07.807
Look at her.

06:07.809 --> 06:09.942
Look at her, cleaning your naughty.

06:09.944 --> 06:13.147
This isn't doing any
good. It's all soaked in.

06:15.483 --> 06:19.386
Oh, we're surrounded by quitters today.

06:21.488 --> 06:25.091
Mm, there she is. There's my girl.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.425
Ready to party?

06:27.427 --> 06:30.762
Yeah, Sonny can I talk to you?

06:30.764 --> 06:33.531
We got a party tonight.

06:33.533 --> 06:35.000
Can we talk alone?

06:35.002 --> 06:38.003
Why? She won't say nothing.

06:38.005 --> 06:40.072
Not too bright.

06:40.074 --> 06:42.007
Fine.

06:42.009 --> 06:43.743
I made up my mind.

06:43.745 --> 06:45.043
I'm ready to move on.

06:45.045 --> 06:47.012
Move on?

06:47.014 --> 06:48.481
The next level?

06:48.483 --> 06:52.218
So, drugs? Do hits? Fucking donkey shows?

06:52.220 --> 06:54.387
What you got in mind?

06:54.389 --> 06:56.154
I don't wanna work anymore.

06:56.156 --> 06:59.959
Please, I got enough lazy bitches to feed.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.526
I'm quiting.

07:01.528 --> 07:03.262
No more parties.

07:03.264 --> 07:06.332
No, you're going out tonight.

07:06.334 --> 07:08.800
Don't set up a gig and
got to come through one.

07:08.802 --> 07:11.803
New girl's going with ya.

07:11.805 --> 07:15.473
You're not getting me to work with kids.

07:15.475 --> 07:19.010
Not Tabby. I'm just baby sitting.

07:19.012 --> 07:20.445
Besides, silly bitch done give everything

07:20.447 --> 07:21.981
away for free anyway.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.884
Look, I'm telling you I quit.

07:24.886 --> 07:27.553
Women...

07:27.555 --> 07:31.123
I knew I should have invested in trannies.

07:31.125 --> 07:33.291
Sit down!

07:33.293 --> 07:35.695
Floor's full of bugs and Fritos.

07:35.697 --> 07:38.363
And you'll eat off it if I tell you to.

07:38.365 --> 07:39.498
Not likely.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.767
You knew from day one you wouldn't

07:41.769 --> 07:43.502
be able to walk away from this.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.570
Made it all clear.

07:44.572 --> 07:46.805
You're in, you're in.

07:46.807 --> 07:49.474
Nothing lasts forever.

07:49.476 --> 07:52.310
I could twist your fucking head right now.

07:52.312 --> 07:53.546
You seen it all.

07:53.548 --> 07:57.783
Loose ends ain't how business works.

07:57.785 --> 07:59.618
Things are different for me.

07:59.620 --> 08:01.887
You know if you let me go I'm down.

08:01.889 --> 08:03.255
I won't say shit to anyone.

08:03.257 --> 08:05.591
I've earned my pass.

08:05.593 --> 08:08.793
You leave me hanging and
I'll leave you hanging

08:08.795 --> 08:10.829
by your neck.

08:10.831 --> 08:14.501
Now, you got a party to go to.

08:16.137 --> 08:20.074
One job, it's the last
one and then I'm out.

08:25.346 --> 08:26.611
Whatever you say.

08:26.613 --> 08:28.279
I'm serious.

08:31.285 --> 08:34.852
Be sure to spread them extra wide tonight.

08:34.855 --> 08:37.657
Take in as much as possible.

08:41.129 --> 08:43.727
Where am I going?

08:43.730 --> 08:46.165
Poot's getting the other girls.

08:46.167 --> 08:47.532
They'll pick ya up.

08:52.807 --> 08:54.375
Love!

08:55.809 --> 08:58.743
You look lovely!

08:58.745 --> 09:00.045
Poot, you're looking like a grown man

09:00.047 --> 09:01.881
that likes to be called Poot.

09:01.883 --> 09:04.449
Hey, meet the girls.

09:04.451 --> 09:08.853
This is Halley, like the comet.

09:08.855 --> 09:12.760
And this is Jenna.

09:18.198 --> 09:21.800
All right, well why don't
you guys get acquainted,

09:21.802 --> 09:24.969
I am gonna smoke a J
and we'll be on the way.

09:24.971 --> 09:26.738
Why don't we just leave?

09:26.740 --> 09:27.940
Got plenty of time.

09:27.942 --> 09:30.209
I figure they're gonna have you ladies do

09:30.211 --> 09:33.244
one of those
cheek-to-cheek dildo things.

09:33.246 --> 09:36.382
You know, I figure you might
wanna feel each other up or,

09:36.384 --> 09:37.483
oops did I say that?

09:37.485 --> 09:40.419
I meant feel each other out.

09:40.421 --> 09:42.253
What's a cheek to cheek?

09:42.255 --> 09:45.593
It's like A Requiem for a Dream.

09:47.528 --> 09:49.127
I don't know what the shit you just said.

09:49.129 --> 09:50.463
It's a gross movie.

09:50.465 --> 09:51.464
Scared me.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.665
See, we know each other.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.300
Hailey's the movie critic and Jenna...

09:54.302 --> 09:55.233
The actress.

09:55.235 --> 09:56.401
You may have seen me on MySpace,

09:56.403 --> 09:59.473
like a thousand-hundred friends.

10:00.607 --> 10:03.108
Can we just get this
thing over and done with?

10:03.110 --> 10:05.210
Damn girl, you horny or what?

10:05.212 --> 10:07.781
Very or what.

10:10.750 --> 10:12.484
All right!

10:12.486 --> 10:15.689
Cram in, we'll roll.

10:16.857 --> 10:19.657
Oh, sexy leprechaun.

10:19.659 --> 10:23.062
"They're always after me Lucky Charms!"

11:00.902 --> 11:02.468
It's the vacation home.

11:02.470 --> 11:04.435
Anytime is perfect.

11:04.437 --> 11:06.070
I'm putting the keys in the box right now.

11:06.072 --> 11:08.273
You should bring your clients by tomorrow.

11:08.275 --> 11:09.574
Well next week then.

11:09.576 --> 11:10.776
Sell it for me Ricky.

11:10.778 --> 11:13.512
I've got a 900 channel cable bill to pay.

11:15.917 --> 11:18.919
Excuse me, are you...

11:20.721 --> 11:22.720
I didn't see another car in the driveway.

11:22.722 --> 11:25.492
Were you looking at the house?

11:47.847 --> 11:49.614
Am I calling at a bad time?

11:49.616 --> 11:51.083
I just don't wanna bug you.

11:51.085 --> 11:53.651
If you bug me you'll be the first to know.

11:53.653 --> 11:55.153
All right, I just don't wanna smother you.

11:55.155 --> 11:57.189
You know, people like people
and the next thing you know

11:57.191 --> 11:59.724
the word stalker's being thrown around.

11:59.726 --> 12:02.194
Sounds like you have a past
I'm needing to know about?

12:02.196 --> 12:03.796
Oh, nothing deeper than a nerd who,

12:03.798 --> 12:07.432
when the girls said jump he'd jump.

12:07.434 --> 12:08.901
Right off a cliff.

12:08.903 --> 12:10.469
I've got one last thing to do tonight

12:10.471 --> 12:12.338
and then we'll talk, okay?

12:12.340 --> 12:13.738
What do you want to talk about?

12:13.740 --> 12:15.541
Our world.

12:17.544 --> 12:19.511
Okay, what time are you picking us back up?

12:19.513 --> 12:22.214
That is on a
need-to-know basis.

12:22.216 --> 12:23.715
Figures.

12:23.717 --> 12:27.219
Hey, Sonny is dealing with
evil shit all day long.

12:27.221 --> 12:29.220
He doesn't have time for me to bug him

12:29.222 --> 12:30.789
with every last detail.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.727
Yeah, well I'm glad our
well-being is a little detail.

12:54.548 --> 12:56.949
Why don't I just come get you right now?

12:56.951 --> 12:58.316
People need to know
they can save themselves

12:58.318 --> 13:01.487
before they let others protect them.

13:01.489 --> 13:02.820
All right, well whatever it is you

13:02.822 --> 13:05.056
have to prove or do I respect that

13:05.058 --> 13:09.060
but I'd rather you drop it
and come hang out with me.

13:09.062 --> 13:11.863
There are many things
I wanna say to you, Ned.

13:11.865 --> 13:16.734
Wonderful happy things but
they're not for the phone

13:16.736 --> 13:20.772
and they're definitely not for right now.

13:20.774 --> 13:21.940
All right, well if you
need me I'll be there

13:21.942 --> 13:23.608
in a flash.

13:23.610 --> 13:26.880
I'll call you tonight, I promise.

13:28.416 --> 13:30.748
I love you.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.720
And you're the only
person I make promises to.

13:42.562 --> 13:46.598
You could have made different
choices, do you agree?

13:46.600 --> 13:49.233
No, you don't.

13:49.235 --> 13:53.473
You are just a dumb-eyed, drooling victim.

13:54.575 --> 13:58.276
People don't plan to
die but when they do they

13:58.278 --> 14:00.848
just lie down for it.

14:03.149 --> 14:06.319
People don't have freedom of choice.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.824
Only choice you can make
depends upon your options.

14:12.692 --> 14:16.162
So outside influences direct the outcome.

14:18.732 --> 14:22.001
People don't have the power of free will...

14:23.837 --> 14:25.671
but they do have the power to direct

14:25.673 --> 14:28.141
the free will of others.

14:29.476 --> 14:31.244
Ripples.

14:32.679 --> 14:34.447
Ripples...

14:35.582 --> 14:38.618
in a pond of chaos.

14:44.191 --> 14:45.826
Take it.

14:47.961 --> 14:49.862
Take it.

14:53.833 --> 14:56.069
Now...

14:59.506 --> 15:01.672
what are you doing here?

15:08.182 --> 15:09.680
What are your names?

15:09.682 --> 15:11.049
Jenna.

15:11.051 --> 15:12.350
Halley.

15:12.352 --> 15:14.051
Scarlet.

15:14.053 --> 15:16.456
Your real names.

15:17.490 --> 15:19.090
Sasha.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.960
Angel.

15:22.363 --> 15:23.594
Barbara.

15:23.596 --> 15:25.833
They've had some training.

15:26.966 --> 15:29.600
Sucks when you have to do rentals.

15:29.602 --> 15:31.570
Should look into
rent-to-own, baby.

15:31.572 --> 15:33.305
I'm Cleb!

15:35.809 --> 15:38.277
I'm Mistress Selma.

15:40.380 --> 15:44.283
So, the ice is broken...

15:45.552 --> 15:48.119
and we've all fallen through.

15:48.121 --> 15:50.857
Well let's warm things up then.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.027
Well my name's Hate.

15:56.029 --> 15:58.629
Is that warm enough for you?

16:00.934 --> 16:03.535
So, you're successful.

16:03.537 --> 16:04.972
Mm-hm.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.406
Good looking.

16:08.408 --> 16:09.141
Yeah.

16:09.143 --> 16:11.008
Why escorts?

16:11.010 --> 16:12.844
Just you.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.914
Escort, no plural.

16:15.916 --> 16:19.685
I don't know, girls, I don't
wanna say they're needy,

16:19.687 --> 16:21.118
but wanty.

16:21.120 --> 16:22.887
As opposed to guys?

16:22.889 --> 16:27.693
Well I only swing one way
so it's a one-sided view.

16:27.695 --> 16:31.028
So look, a lot of women are smart enough

16:31.030 --> 16:33.965
to get what they need but they make men

16:33.967 --> 16:37.636
bend over backwards for
stupid shit they want like,

16:37.638 --> 16:42.109
cars and clothes.

16:44.110 --> 16:48.180
Well, women are more materialistic.

16:48.182 --> 16:52.283
You know, no picking
flowers, just store-bought?

16:52.285 --> 16:56.021
That and talking on cell phones 24/7.

16:56.023 --> 17:00.025
Oh and they meet a guy
who's a wannabe rocker,

17:00.027 --> 17:03.628
plays a little guitar, they're gone.

17:03.630 --> 17:07.565
Okay, so does it bother
you when girls say that

17:07.567 --> 17:10.868
most of her friends are men?

17:10.871 --> 17:14.205
Oh, yeah that's who
they're talking to right?

17:14.208 --> 17:16.674
I mean anyone that's serious about someone,

17:16.675 --> 17:19.377
if you're spending more
time with another boy

17:19.380 --> 17:20.978
they're gonna get mad.

17:20.980 --> 17:24.115
I mean, it's not jealousy
it's just common sense.

17:24.117 --> 17:26.218
And these are all younger women, right?

17:26.220 --> 17:29.220
Come on, don't be coy.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.355
Men mature a lot slower than women.

17:31.357 --> 17:34.058
It's that whole dawn of the manchild thing.

17:34.060 --> 17:36.361
Well women fuck you
over when they're younger

17:36.363 --> 17:40.032
because when you get older
you're gonna fuck them over.

17:40.034 --> 17:41.400
I know where you're going
with this and it's bullshit.

17:41.402 --> 17:42.601
- Do you?
- Yeah.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.635
Women put most the pressure on themselves.

17:44.637 --> 17:46.537
I mean, walking around all annoying,

17:46.539 --> 17:49.040
"I'm fat, oh I need Botox."

17:49.042 --> 17:51.509
Oh, come on!

17:51.511 --> 17:52.944
Bullshit!

17:52.946 --> 17:55.447
The moment a girl doesn't
look like a bikini model

17:55.449 --> 17:57.015
the man starts chasing tail.

17:57.017 --> 17:59.985
Take your average woman
and your poor sap guy

17:59.987 --> 18:02.520
and when they get older he is going to dump

18:02.522 --> 18:04.957
her ass to fuck escorts.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.391
I know.

18:06.393 --> 18:08.293
Well if they've been together
long enough he probably

18:08.295 --> 18:10.495
won't have enough money to fuck escorts.

18:11.765 --> 18:12.730
Oh, you've just been burnt by some bitches.

18:12.732 --> 18:14.565
Don't lump us all into one.

18:14.567 --> 18:16.000
Are we fighting?

18:16.002 --> 18:18.236
I was thinking I was gonna
hit you with this pillow.

18:18.238 --> 18:21.506
No, I think that I am going to

18:21.508 --> 18:25.776
tiger shuck your arm,

18:25.778 --> 18:28.779
pull it down here and tickle you to death.

18:28.781 --> 18:31.449
Oh, I think you'll regret that.

18:31.451 --> 18:34.954
Okay, oh mercy! Mercy, mercy.

18:37.023 --> 18:39.423
See, you peed a little bit.

18:39.425 --> 18:41.261
Shut up.

18:42.496 --> 18:45.564
Seriously though.

18:45.566 --> 18:47.332
What?

18:47.334 --> 18:51.769
If that's what bothers you
about girls, why escorts?

18:51.771 --> 18:53.572
Just you.

18:53.574 --> 18:55.740
I figured I'd know what
I was getting myself into

18:55.742 --> 18:58.276
beforehand with you.

18:58.278 --> 19:00.245
Now what do you think?

19:00.247 --> 19:04.649
I think you're worth
learning to play guitar for?

19:04.651 --> 19:06.117
Banjo?

19:06.119 --> 19:08.519
Stick to flower picking.

19:08.521 --> 19:12.224
Dandelions, they'd be my favorite.

19:32.011 --> 19:33.812
Is your name really Hate?

19:33.814 --> 19:36.414
Well, my parents didn't get along so well.

19:36.416 --> 19:39.450
I think it's a sexy name.

19:39.452 --> 19:42.421
Bit dramatic.

19:42.423 --> 19:44.823
Or simple.

19:44.825 --> 19:46.224
I'm a simple guy.

19:46.226 --> 19:48.026
My name's short for Clebidiah.

19:48.028 --> 19:50.094
That's unique.

19:50.096 --> 19:52.564
I thought we were gonna party.

19:52.566 --> 19:55.066
Yeah my hosting skills are a bit rusty.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.701
We're not "people" people.

19:57.703 --> 19:59.703
Okay.

19:59.705 --> 20:01.440
I'm gonna get drinks.

20:01.442 --> 20:03.240
Is there any booze in this house?

20:03.242 --> 20:06.510
No, sit back down.

20:06.512 --> 20:08.748
Cleb will get it.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.553
Cleb.

20:19.593 --> 20:23.562
So, what do you guys do?

20:23.564 --> 20:27.498
Ordering a three-girl takeout
must be a special occasion.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.366
We are actors.

20:30.671 --> 20:34.439
Yeah, we're in a play. Rave reviews.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.173
Anything I've heard of?

20:36.175 --> 20:37.609
Three Mad Mice.

20:37.611 --> 20:40.313
Do you have a MySpace?

20:41.582 --> 20:44.248
So, you guys do movies?

20:44.250 --> 20:46.884
Film is not my medium of choice.

20:46.886 --> 20:50.488
I suppose the art has its value.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.624
I prefer to use my mind.

20:53.626 --> 20:57.562
I bet there's a lot of dirty
things going on up there.

20:57.564 --> 21:00.332
Can you explain that?

21:00.334 --> 21:03.937
What you just said about your mind.

21:05.038 --> 21:10.342
Use my mind as a projector.

21:10.344 --> 21:13.978
To put Hate out into the world.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.180
That's so hot.

21:15.182 --> 21:17.951
First call for alcohol!

21:25.692 --> 21:27.793
Thank you.

21:39.006 --> 21:42.440
"And that," said the
snail "is the slick of it."

21:42.442 --> 21:44.810
Get it, huh?

21:45.979 --> 21:48.315
Slick of it.

21:51.218 --> 21:53.384
That's dumb.

21:53.386 --> 21:57.389
Bless the power of beer
to bring us all together.

21:57.391 --> 21:59.924
One beer to rule them all.

21:59.926 --> 22:02.994
Yeah but what kind of party
can you have with a 24-pack?

22:02.996 --> 22:05.699
Have mine.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.835
Haven't touched it.

22:10.103 --> 22:11.268
Thank you.

22:11.270 --> 22:13.337
Mm, I guess now we see who's all more

22:13.339 --> 22:15.574
bearable as a drunk.

22:15.576 --> 22:18.442
I can't even get a buzz
off six beers, come on.

22:18.444 --> 22:21.912
There's mutual desires in compatibility.

22:21.914 --> 22:23.113
Not the beer.

22:23.115 --> 22:24.882
On a basic human level the beer brings out

22:24.884 --> 22:26.183
our compatibility.

22:26.185 --> 22:30.521
I doubt anyone has the
same desires as Cleb.

22:30.523 --> 22:33.857
You all laughed at the stupid snail joke.

22:33.859 --> 22:35.994
It's lack of humor should indicate to you

22:35.996 --> 22:38.529
our mutual desire to get along

22:38.531 --> 22:41.132
regardless of motivation.

22:41.134 --> 22:45.135
Beer makes us laugh at
all sorts of stupid things.

22:45.137 --> 22:46.270
You weren't drinking.

22:46.272 --> 22:49.673
You weren't laughing.

22:49.675 --> 22:52.509
In this scenario,

22:52.511 --> 22:56.314
this basic human level you speak of,

22:56.316 --> 23:00.017
it's Tab A into Slot B for money.

23:00.019 --> 23:02.653
We all signed on without a drink.

23:02.655 --> 23:06.591
I don't know what the fuck
y'all are talking about.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.759
Does somebody have another joke?

23:08.761 --> 23:11.863
Yeah, tell us a joke.

23:11.865 --> 23:15.499
I don't usually carry any around, sorry.

23:15.501 --> 23:17.469
You got one or two.

23:17.471 --> 23:21.905
Nothing intellectual enough
for you I don't think.

23:21.907 --> 23:25.343
Cleb and I probably memorized
the same books as kids.

23:25.345 --> 23:29.648
Boy, I bet you can hold your own.

23:30.750 --> 23:32.851
You're not as simple as you said you were.

23:32.853 --> 23:34.286
I just like to keep my eyes open.

23:34.288 --> 23:35.653
Now tell us a joke.

23:35.655 --> 23:37.455
Make it a funny one.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.159
Okay.

23:41.228 --> 23:43.661
Two snowmen are walking in a meadow.

23:43.663 --> 23:47.532
The first snowman says
to the second snowman,

23:47.534 --> 23:50.203
"Do you smell carrots?"

24:03.849 --> 24:04.949
I don't get it.

24:04.951 --> 24:06.851
Snowmen can't walk.

24:06.853 --> 24:08.519
Snails can't talk either.

24:08.521 --> 24:10.988
All living creatures use
some means of communication.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.590
Just becuase we can't understand them

24:12.592 --> 24:14.459
doesn't mean snails can't talk.

24:14.461 --> 24:18.632
Whereas snowmen are
innanimate lifeless entities.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.900
Very good, Cleb.

24:21.902 --> 24:26.237
Every retard has its moment I guess.

24:26.239 --> 24:29.140
See, they don't get along.

24:29.142 --> 24:31.543
Oh, they know each other
so that doesn't count.

24:31.545 --> 24:34.345
Ah, so it's all healthy?

24:34.347 --> 24:36.081
We've bonded.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.652
Right.

24:40.487 --> 24:42.754
Yeah, I think it's time
we divided up and got down

24:42.756 --> 24:44.588
to business.

24:44.590 --> 24:46.591
Got my victim.

24:46.593 --> 24:50.260
I would appreciate it
if you were to accompany

24:50.262 --> 24:54.565
me this evening.

24:54.567 --> 24:57.067
Hey, I've been batting
eylashes at you all night.

24:57.069 --> 24:59.271
You'll have fun with Cleb.

25:00.339 --> 25:03.607
One-on-one
time!

25:03.609 --> 25:07.046
We're not playing love connection.

25:08.248 --> 25:10.315
You gotta play it to win it.

25:10.317 --> 25:13.117
I paid for all the prizes.

25:13.119 --> 25:16.086
Then I guess you want the best.

25:16.088 --> 25:18.957
Barbara here intrigues me.

25:18.959 --> 25:21.025
Barbara's not her real name.

25:21.027 --> 25:24.094
It's all part of the adventure.

25:24.096 --> 25:25.462
You don't know my name.

25:25.464 --> 25:28.665
Oh I knew you the second
I laid eyes on you.

25:28.667 --> 25:31.570
You want power and money.

25:39.712 --> 25:43.782
I know it ain't 'cause of my pretty mug.

25:44.917 --> 25:47.751
I like your ears.

25:47.753 --> 25:52.658
If you want anything you
will rock Cleb's world.

25:54.126 --> 25:57.530
I need him crazy happy.

25:59.398 --> 26:02.767
He looks pretty happy to me.

26:02.769 --> 26:06.772
Wait till you see him crazy happy.

26:28.662 --> 26:31.094
What time should I pick 'em up?

26:31.096 --> 26:33.864
Eh, leave 'em.

26:33.866 --> 26:38.068
Love's copped an attitude.
Let her find her own way home.

26:38.070 --> 26:42.073
Sometimes think I'll just
kill everybody and start over.

26:42.075 --> 26:44.476
Nobody dependable anymore.

26:44.478 --> 26:45.977
Might as well rotate through strangers

26:45.979 --> 26:48.680
just bump off those
that don't make the cut.

26:48.682 --> 26:51.015
I'd say no to that.

26:51.017 --> 26:55.622
Hm, too much killing bad for business.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.727
You can't retire from this business.

27:02.729 --> 27:04.696
In it 'till you die.

27:04.698 --> 27:08.034
Or until you die.

27:10.403 --> 27:13.606
More reason to kill everybody first.

27:21.448 --> 27:23.280
Don't go.

27:52.211 --> 27:55.248
Oh, just right.

28:18.872 --> 28:21.639
This is for the couch because my skin

28:21.641 --> 28:24.241
gets sticky and will stick to the leather.

28:24.243 --> 28:26.879
Oh god.

28:28.981 --> 28:31.617
I better stretch.

28:33.153 --> 28:35.586
I brought you something.

28:35.588 --> 28:37.889
As long as it's not heroine.

28:37.891 --> 28:40.626
I promised my sponsor.

28:41.795 --> 28:44.564
I'm into role playing.

28:48.634 --> 28:50.267
What is this, the sex olympics

28:50.269 --> 28:52.170
and I'm your cheerleader?

28:52.172 --> 28:54.972
Not quite the plan.

28:54.974 --> 28:57.174
Go in the bathroom and put that on.

28:57.176 --> 29:00.077
While you're in there go ahead
and lose the bitch attitude.

29:00.079 --> 29:01.379
I want you sweet.

29:01.381 --> 29:04.681
Ah, ah, ah, time is money.

29:04.683 --> 29:08.788
Come on it's gonna be fun!

29:28.942 --> 29:31.609
So what do you think?

29:31.611 --> 29:35.214
My ears I mean.

29:36.516 --> 29:38.248
As you 90's kids might say,

29:38.250 --> 29:41.318
"All that and a bag of Doritos."

29:41.320 --> 29:42.719
They suit you.

29:42.721 --> 29:44.622
Strong character.

29:44.624 --> 29:47.093
Nice wingspan.

29:51.431 --> 29:54.599
Not sure you look part
of the family though.

29:54.601 --> 29:57.200
We're all God's children.

29:57.202 --> 29:59.103
From time to time.

29:59.105 --> 30:02.039
Well what about me?

30:02.041 --> 30:06.111
Am I cheese and crackers?

30:07.614 --> 30:10.314
You?

30:10.316 --> 30:12.816
You are the cats meow.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.156
You can sit on the bed.

30:23.630 --> 30:27.633
Should I relax or get sexy?

30:30.170 --> 30:32.103
Well you could try tense
and ugly if you'd like,

30:32.105 --> 30:34.505
but I doubt you got the talent.

30:34.507 --> 30:37.341
Hm, sounds like a compliment.

30:37.343 --> 30:40.010
And a challenge.

30:45.585 --> 30:48.621
Ha! Ready to bump this?

31:37.136 --> 31:39.438
Dance for me.

31:47.212 --> 31:49.479
Dance like your life depends on it.

31:53.519 --> 31:57.854
Oh yeah, that's it.

31:57.856 --> 32:01.660
Uh-huh, mm.

32:06.165 --> 32:08.165
Stop.

32:08.167 --> 32:10.202
No.

32:12.204 --> 32:14.538
Like this.

32:20.747 --> 32:23.116
That's it.

32:30.690 --> 32:32.925
Get on the bed.

32:38.030 --> 32:40.530
Say, "Yes Mistress."

32:40.532 --> 32:43.535
Yes, Mistress.

32:57.317 --> 33:00.785
Lick my toes.

33:00.787 --> 33:02.989
Yes, Mistress.

33:09.796 --> 33:11.895
That's it.

33:11.897 --> 33:13.463
Really get 'em good.

33:13.465 --> 33:15.367
Yes, Mistress.

33:17.269 --> 33:18.702
Get into it.

33:18.704 --> 33:23.141
Really get the soles clean.

33:25.144 --> 33:27.680
Oh yeah.

33:30.282 --> 33:34.085
Mm-hm, ah.

33:36.122 --> 33:37.889
You're too easy.

33:37.891 --> 33:39.858
Come here.

34:03.615 --> 34:05.783
Command me, Madam.

34:05.785 --> 34:07.517
Suck my toes.

34:07.519 --> 34:09.719
But I already did.

34:09.722 --> 34:11.289
Please, no more.

34:11.291 --> 34:14.527
Yes, more.

34:24.202 --> 34:27.039
Smell 'em, slave.

34:35.782 --> 34:38.516
Tell me your name.

34:40.485 --> 34:43.253
A stranger will still be a stranger

34:43.255 --> 34:46.289
by any other name.

34:46.291 --> 34:49.025
I want to know.

34:49.027 --> 34:51.762
Mm, you want to know Barbara.

34:51.764 --> 34:55.667
Behave and Barbara might let you.

34:57.003 --> 35:01.240
See now there you go.

35:02.641 --> 35:06.646
Just like your friend thinking
you got some kind of control.

35:07.746 --> 35:10.515
You're bought and paid for.

35:11.884 --> 35:14.584
Do you debate everything?

35:14.586 --> 35:17.688
We can sit here all night, chat.

35:17.690 --> 35:20.392
Cool with me.

35:21.460 --> 35:24.762
Your intelligence suits you.

35:24.764 --> 35:28.434
Why, strong character.

35:30.670 --> 35:33.871
Nice wingspan.

35:33.873 --> 35:36.539
Okay old man.

35:38.244 --> 35:42.713
What you refuse to
comprehend is a need for girls

35:42.715 --> 35:47.117
like my friend and I to
remain separate from the girls

35:47.119 --> 35:50.220
you paid for.

35:50.222 --> 35:53.257
Oh, comprehension's got
nothing to do with it.

35:53.259 --> 35:54.425
Oh?

35:54.427 --> 35:55.592
I've just been around long enough

35:55.594 --> 35:57.028
to know better is all.

35:57.030 --> 35:57.994
Really?

35:59.132 --> 36:00.463
Come on.

36:00.465 --> 36:03.166
Are you the same guy that orders hookers or

36:03.168 --> 36:06.771
are you better than that guy?

36:10.342 --> 36:12.610
I'm looking for someone special.

36:12.612 --> 36:18.048
Mm, has it been a long search?

36:18.050 --> 36:21.753
It's been ripe.

36:30.063 --> 36:31.996
Let's dance.

36:31.998 --> 36:35.965
You don't need to woo
what's already been bought.

36:35.967 --> 36:37.836
Get up.

36:41.873 --> 36:44.642
Dance with me?

36:59.092 --> 37:01.691
But there isn't any music.

37:01.693 --> 37:04.228
There's always music.

37:04.230 --> 37:06.464
You just gotta listen for it.

37:07.532 --> 37:10.903
Put your quarter in the juke.

37:12.338 --> 37:14.905
Circus music.

37:14.907 --> 37:17.141
How fitting.

37:17.143 --> 37:19.245
Yeah.

37:35.862 --> 37:37.830
Now tell me your name.

37:43.302 --> 37:44.568
Yeah?

37:44.570 --> 37:47.871
Barbara Givens.

37:50.208 --> 37:52.477
Look at me.

37:55.981 --> 38:00.486
Now I want to take you by force...

38:02.420 --> 38:07.423
but I need you to want me to.

38:07.425 --> 38:11.830
I don't go from normal to
psycho in just three seconds.

38:15.867 --> 38:19.003
One, two, three.

38:24.710 --> 38:26.778
Tell me your name.

38:27.847 --> 38:30.716
Give me your name.

38:32.117 --> 38:33.316
I will take it.

38:33.318 --> 38:35.287
I will take it!

38:38.190 --> 38:42.592
Tell me your name!

38:42.594 --> 38:43.726
Love.

38:43.728 --> 38:44.295
What?

38:44.297 --> 38:45.798
Love.

38:47.065 --> 38:48.867
What?

38:51.369 --> 38:54.240
Love, you asshole.

38:58.411 --> 39:01.580
This is the perfect circle.

39:09.989 --> 39:12.658
I knew I would find you.

39:16.461 --> 39:19.295
Thank you. Harder.

39:22.068 --> 39:24.236
Thank you. Harder.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.710
Thank you. Harder.

39:35.313 --> 39:37.849
Thank you. Softer.

39:39.217 --> 39:43.220
Ah, hey!

39:43.222 --> 39:46.825
You take it and you like it, slave.

39:51.831 --> 39:56.100
Oh, you are very promising.

39:58.871 --> 40:01.839
Now we take it to the next level.

40:08.581 --> 40:12.383
So what, are you gonna
be a pain in the ass too?

40:12.385 --> 40:14.717
Like the sequel.

40:14.719 --> 40:15.918
What?

40:15.920 --> 40:19.822
"Pain in the Ass Part Two: Mo' Ass"

40:19.824 --> 40:21.791
You're a crackhead.

40:21.793 --> 40:25.595
Look, I might be new to
the game but I can play,

40:25.597 --> 40:28.898
and I need the money
so I can, I don't know,

40:28.900 --> 40:30.633
afford stuff that I might need to afford.

40:30.635 --> 40:32.504
Bigger tits.

40:34.907 --> 40:37.907
I mean, I can't club and fuck forever.

40:37.909 --> 40:39.776
Hey by all means keep getting 'em bigger

40:39.778 --> 40:41.744
no matter how old.

40:41.746 --> 40:43.914
Be one of them freakshow grannies.

40:43.916 --> 40:45.682
People pay.

40:45.684 --> 40:49.552
Mm, no thank you.

40:49.554 --> 40:51.889
I'm gonna find another way to spend my life

40:51.891 --> 40:55.227
or I don't know, maybe it'll find me.

40:56.362 --> 40:58.162
Look, I don't do sports.

40:58.164 --> 41:00.332
Don't worry about that.

41:05.704 --> 41:08.606
I wanna watch you suck this off.

41:16.481 --> 41:18.684
Use both hands.

41:23.489 --> 41:25.822
Both hands.

41:25.824 --> 41:27.858
That's it.

41:27.860 --> 41:31.230
Careful, don't chip a tooth.

41:49.849 --> 41:51.581
Ow!

41:51.583 --> 41:52.816
What the hell was that?

41:52.818 --> 41:56.286
Just a little something.

41:56.288 --> 41:58.354
That's it.

41:58.356 --> 42:03.092
It'll feel good in a
minute just take it all in.

42:03.094 --> 42:06.431
I'm ready for the big game.

42:08.199 --> 42:11.135
I'll do whatever you want.

42:11.137 --> 42:16.175
But call me a bitch again
and we're playing Bobbitt.

42:19.811 --> 42:23.213
I make the stories.

42:23.215 --> 42:25.850
I own the playground.

42:27.119 --> 42:29.521
Recess is in session.

42:34.159 --> 42:35.858
Give me a D.

42:35.860 --> 42:37.628
Give me an A.

42:37.630 --> 42:39.832
Lay down.

42:52.744 --> 42:54.610
So if I'm the cheerleader,

42:54.612 --> 42:56.679
are you my studly football player?

42:56.681 --> 42:58.081
I like dinosuars.

43:09.661 --> 43:12.061
Okay stop, you're scaring me.

43:15.367 --> 43:17.236
Stop.

43:40.693 --> 43:44.463
Oh, you sick whore!

44:06.251 --> 44:08.787
Oh, fucking hell.

44:10.222 --> 44:11.889
Must have been allergic.

45:10.416 --> 45:12.984
Ah, just right.

45:15.153 --> 45:17.387
Oh you like that, don't you?

45:17.389 --> 45:21.490
Oh, you're so ripe.

45:21.492 --> 45:23.595
Oh yeah.

45:27.132 --> 45:29.199
Oh baby.

45:32.338 --> 45:34.737
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

45:34.739 --> 45:37.642
Huh? Huh? Huh?

45:45.416 --> 45:48.284
Yeah, uh you like that don't you?

45:48.286 --> 45:51.354
Yeah? Yeah? Oh yeah?

45:51.356 --> 45:53.123
Yeah? Yeah?

45:59.465 --> 46:02.501
Oh, you're so juicy.

46:08.974 --> 46:10.242
Yeah.

46:11.577 --> 46:14.276
Oh.

46:57.556 --> 47:01.393
Don't stop.

47:13.438 --> 47:15.339
Does that feel good?

47:29.420 --> 47:33.123
Will you look at this mess you've made?

47:33.125 --> 47:34.493
Fuck.

47:37.028 --> 47:38.662
Fuck.

48:00.119 --> 48:02.953
Cleb, this isn't a peep show.

48:08.860 --> 48:10.428
Who's there?

48:25.610 --> 48:28.146
Don't chip a tooth, bitch.

48:33.786 --> 48:37.856
You're having trouble making
up your mind, aren't ya?

48:39.724 --> 48:43.894
Well that's because you're
weighing the consequences.

48:43.896 --> 48:46.929
But are you thinking about the consequences

48:46.931 --> 48:50.167
of weighing those consequences?

48:56.809 --> 48:59.476
You can only stall until your last breath.

49:04.516 --> 49:17.661
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

49:17.663 --> 49:18.528
Ding!

49:53.931 --> 49:56.266
Hey, buddy.

49:56.268 --> 49:57.666
How you doing man? What can I do for you?

49:57.668 --> 49:59.401
I'm looking for Sonny.

49:59.403 --> 50:01.637
Sonny. Well, we don't have any Sonny.

50:01.639 --> 50:04.974
But I got some OJ, a little
soda, some purple stuff.

50:04.976 --> 50:07.644
Look dude, I'm not a cop.

50:07.646 --> 50:08.878
Okay.

50:08.880 --> 50:09.979
Look, I need to talk to Sonny, all right?

50:09.981 --> 50:11.380
It's important.

50:11.382 --> 50:13.483
I told you, Sonny's not here.

50:13.485 --> 50:15.217
Well where can I find him?

50:15.219 --> 50:17.320
Look man, I just pour the drinks.

50:17.322 --> 50:19.322
You want something?

50:19.324 --> 50:20.923
Look, he'd want you to help me, all right?

50:20.925 --> 50:24.428
Otherwise I'm gonna have to call the cops.

50:26.097 --> 50:27.496
Don't piss me off.

50:27.498 --> 50:30.233
You want Sonny, you come when Sonny's here.

50:30.235 --> 50:32.936
Otherwise talk to the manager.

50:32.938 --> 50:35.338
Need an after one special.

50:35.340 --> 50:36.606
You the manager?

50:36.608 --> 50:38.407
What the fuck you want, french fry?

50:38.409 --> 50:39.809
I'm looking for Sonny.

50:39.811 --> 50:41.610
You won't find Sonny
looking at the classy lady.

50:41.612 --> 50:42.778
Isn't this his place?

50:42.780 --> 50:44.981
I'm the classy lady, Irma.

50:44.983 --> 50:46.249
Look, a friend of mine's missing.

50:46.251 --> 50:48.653
I think Sonny could help.

50:53.692 --> 50:55.794
You want this?

50:57.496 --> 50:59.061
Why would I want that?

50:59.063 --> 51:01.865
Gave you a fucking shot, french fry.

51:01.867 --> 51:03.867
What the fuck?

51:03.869 --> 51:06.302
What is that?

51:06.304 --> 51:09.371
Listen kid, Poot's gonna
be in tomorrow around two.

51:09.373 --> 51:11.007
Why don't you come in and
talk to him, all right?

51:11.009 --> 51:12.309
Get yourself out of here.

51:12.311 --> 51:14.411
Hey hey hey!

51:14.413 --> 51:17.781
It ain't nice to leave
without tipping the ladies.

51:33.030 --> 51:35.932
Hey there, sleepy head.

51:35.934 --> 51:39.135
Oh come on, admit it.

51:39.137 --> 51:41.371
Love and Hate.

51:41.373 --> 51:46.377
Uh, that is too grand
to be a coniencidence.

51:47.980 --> 51:49.512
Just means that my parents were into peace

51:49.514 --> 51:50.847
and yours were santanists.

51:52.416 --> 51:55.985
Oh, I'll free you from that logic soon.

51:55.987 --> 51:57.519
Let me go.

51:57.521 --> 51:59.923
Go?

51:59.925 --> 52:02.160
You ain't going nowhere, Love.

52:03.228 --> 52:06.131
Love!

52:08.065 --> 52:10.400
Oh, come on now.

52:10.402 --> 52:13.705
Shh, now listen to me.

52:14.806 --> 52:17.240
Become the truth.

52:17.242 --> 52:18.675
Huh?

52:18.677 --> 52:21.177
Oh shh.

52:21.179 --> 52:23.545
Show me the way.

52:23.547 --> 52:27.050
Yes, you be the key.

52:27.052 --> 52:28.918
You reap the glory.

52:28.920 --> 52:30.619
The way is to let me go.

52:30.621 --> 52:35.124
Oh see, people always want revolution

52:35.126 --> 52:37.760
but you have to force them to participate.

52:37.762 --> 52:41.798
Now, I see your cravin' for change.

52:41.800 --> 52:44.166
It's our craving.

52:48.539 --> 52:49.941
That's it.

52:51.777 --> 52:53.675
We must leave our skin.

52:53.677 --> 52:55.979
You're a late bloomer, huh?

52:55.981 --> 52:59.081
Fucking middle school anarchist!

52:59.083 --> 52:59.983
Man has...

52:59.985 --> 53:04.220
Ah! Blah! Blah, crazy!

53:04.222 --> 53:05.487
No, you don't understand.

53:05.489 --> 53:08.458
You are fucking crazy.
I don't understand you.

53:08.460 --> 53:11.061
There's no magic anymore!

53:13.331 --> 53:14.530
They take that away from you

53:14.532 --> 53:18.202
and make you doubt it was even there.

53:20.539 --> 53:23.341
But revolution has magic.

53:24.675 --> 53:26.041
The magic of revolution.

53:26.043 --> 53:28.546
The magic revolution.

53:31.949 --> 53:35.217
Let's just become about

53:35.219 --> 53:38.287
shakin' shit up to make
people believe something.

53:38.289 --> 53:41.191
To force 'em to believe!

53:41.193 --> 53:44.026
And it ain't for free, either.

53:44.028 --> 53:48.264
You always gotta give 'em somethin'.

53:48.266 --> 53:51.767
No such thing as blind faith anymore.

53:51.769 --> 53:54.737
Everybody wants somethin' so you gotta

53:54.739 --> 53:58.343
give it to 'em to keep the
energy balancing, you know?

54:00.545 --> 54:02.010
Something like...

54:10.889 --> 54:14.456
The whole world is pain, Love.

54:14.458 --> 54:17.294
We must find pleasure in it.

54:18.530 --> 54:23.266
Shh.

54:27.072 --> 54:28.740
Good.

54:31.476 --> 54:35.577
Love, let's take this slow, shall we?

54:39.918 --> 54:43.019
Shh.

54:43.021 --> 54:45.757
Yeah, now...

54:59.204 --> 55:03.139
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to enter you now.

55:03.141 --> 55:06.410
Shh. Shh.

55:17.188 --> 55:19.356
Hold still.

55:28.833 --> 55:31.568
Do I know you?

55:31.570 --> 55:33.235
Yeah we've done business before.

55:33.237 --> 55:35.003
Nice cologne.

55:35.005 --> 55:37.307
What's it called, Narcee?

55:37.309 --> 55:40.409
I'm not a cop, come on.

55:40.411 --> 55:43.313
Oh, we got a slick one!

55:43.315 --> 55:45.882
Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.050
He's listed.

55:47.052 --> 55:49.351
I've tried that.

55:49.353 --> 55:50.019
Really?

55:50.021 --> 55:51.119
Yeah.

55:51.121 --> 55:53.155
Hold on, let me try.

56:01.532 --> 56:03.700
Sucks for you!

56:03.702 --> 56:05.034
Bye.

56:05.036 --> 56:06.869
Have you seen Love?

56:06.871 --> 56:11.309
She was supposed to call me last night.

56:13.143 --> 56:14.510
Wow. Okay.

56:14.512 --> 56:18.847
How do I put this, um, delicate?

56:18.849 --> 56:22.519
She's out, trickin' dick.

56:24.289 --> 56:26.155
Did you think you were special?

56:26.157 --> 56:27.889
Look, I wanna talk to Sonny.

56:29.094 --> 56:32.062
You're a stalker, huh?

56:34.032 --> 56:37.468
Jackson's no stalker though, huh?

56:38.702 --> 56:41.039
Uh...

56:42.206 --> 56:43.840
okay!

57:04.929 --> 57:08.031
Were you pretending, hm?

57:14.706 --> 57:18.443
You know, you brought a
valiant fight to the fuck.

57:21.478 --> 57:25.514
My army will rise with
that spirit as its backbone.

57:25.516 --> 57:27.516
It was resistance.

57:27.518 --> 57:29.818
And what army? You and the other two tarts?

57:29.820 --> 57:32.954
Cleb and Selma?

57:32.956 --> 57:35.224
Well, you see, Love,

57:35.226 --> 57:36.726
you buy a toy that's
broken, you know what you're

57:36.728 --> 57:39.729
playing with, you know?

57:39.731 --> 57:43.465
Cleb and Selma have proven their loyalty.

57:43.467 --> 57:47.704
Now, they're gonna be dust soon but...

57:49.541 --> 57:52.075
well, they served their purpose!

57:52.077 --> 57:54.443
You win.

57:54.445 --> 57:56.679
Untie me.

57:56.681 --> 57:58.616
Let's go revolt.

57:59.851 --> 58:01.819
Really?

58:04.621 --> 58:05.954
No, I think I'll go have lunch.

58:08.360 --> 58:11.029
But, when I come back...

58:12.130 --> 58:15.998
I'm gonna beat the holy crap out of you.

58:16.000 --> 58:20.738
And then, I'll deliver you unto the portal.

58:22.940 --> 58:24.639
Enjoy your last meal.

58:27.112 --> 58:29.045
Yeah, try that.

58:29.047 --> 58:31.347
Go ahead, you just lie
there with your pretty self

58:31.349 --> 58:34.784
and you will me to choke or something.

58:34.786 --> 58:37.588
Better yet.

58:41.092 --> 58:42.593
Now...

58:44.027 --> 58:46.862
you just try to get a hand free.

58:46.864 --> 58:50.700
I come back, you'll
smother me with a pillow.

58:50.702 --> 58:54.269
Now that I know your death
wish I'll be sure to satisfy.

58:54.271 --> 58:55.640
Oh...

58:57.074 --> 58:59.242
I hope you mean that.

59:02.414 --> 59:04.447
Anyway.

59:11.121 --> 59:14.791
Don't go crying when I leave this room now.

59:14.793 --> 59:16.928
I'll be listening.

59:25.135 --> 59:26.802
I figured it'd be that way.

59:26.804 --> 59:28.537
As long as I didn't send the car around.

59:28.539 --> 59:29.905
Second night is gonna cost you though,

59:29.907 --> 59:32.109
those are my best girls.

59:34.746 --> 59:36.379
Uh-huh.

59:37.882 --> 59:40.249
Same as before, plus three more.

59:40.251 --> 59:42.485
Mm-hm.

59:42.487 --> 59:45.621
I'll run the card again.

59:45.623 --> 59:47.524
Enjoy.

59:51.496 --> 59:54.265
Stalker, followed me.

59:56.067 --> 59:59.568
I'm looking for Love.

59:59.570 --> 01:00:03.374
We can't guarantee anything
but, I know some wild chicks.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:06.508
Have a seat, start talking money.

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:07.709
Look, cut the bullshit, all right?

01:00:07.711 --> 01:00:09.244
You know who I'm talking about.

01:00:09.246 --> 01:00:12.014
Uh-oh.

01:00:12.016 --> 01:00:15.217
It's okay, Poot. I'm
in a better mood today.

01:00:15.219 --> 01:00:17.452
Look, no disrespect, all right?

01:00:17.454 --> 01:00:19.921
I'm just worried about her.

01:00:19.923 --> 01:00:23.659
Tabby, start me some businessin' music.

01:00:25.829 --> 01:00:27.295
You called.

01:00:27.297 --> 01:00:28.331
What was your name?

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.965
Ned.

01:00:29.967 --> 01:00:32.034
Now peep this, Ned.

01:00:32.036 --> 01:00:36.171
Love is a hooker. Nasty.

01:00:36.173 --> 01:00:39.008
Me? I'm a pimp.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:41.010
Love's pimp.

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:45.380
I pick who gets to get their jollies off.

01:00:45.382 --> 01:00:47.782
On her face.

01:00:47.784 --> 01:00:50.387
Are your jollies backed up?

01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:56.027
I'm her boyfriend.

01:00:58.463 --> 01:01:00.862
People always have to pay me first.

01:01:00.864 --> 01:01:02.264
She was supposed to call me last night.

01:01:02.266 --> 01:01:06.838
People always have to pay me first!

01:01:08.539 --> 01:01:10.307
Tabby!

01:01:13.277 --> 01:01:16.112
Look, I just wanna know if she's okay!

01:01:20.485 --> 01:01:23.754
Sonny, do you know where she is? Please.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.003
Hey!

01:01:42.005 --> 01:01:44.039
Um...

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:47.342
Sonny says that if you see Love again,

01:01:47.344 --> 01:01:50.445
he's gonna break both your legs.

01:01:50.447 --> 01:01:52.715
And he's not talking about both your legs,

01:01:52.717 --> 01:01:56.821
he's also talking about breaking hers too.

01:01:58.188 --> 01:02:00.124
Nice meetin' ya!

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:33.290
Do you hear something?

01:02:34.692 --> 01:02:36.626
Desperation.

01:03:34.351 --> 01:03:36.584
Oh, god!

01:03:36.586 --> 01:03:38.420
Oh, there's a catch.

01:03:38.422 --> 01:03:41.824
Oh, we got one.

01:03:52.936 --> 01:03:54.269
She is beautiful.

01:03:54.271 --> 01:03:56.438
Just another canary.

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:02.077
- Going somewhere?
- Hold her.

01:04:02.079 --> 01:04:04.179
What? Come without a call?

01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:05.981
Please don't do this to me.

01:04:05.983 --> 01:04:08.719
Don't give up.

01:04:19.563 --> 01:04:21.996
We need to meet like this more often.

01:04:21.998 --> 01:04:23.865
You know, you're a real life saver, Mike.

01:04:23.867 --> 01:04:25.434
I'd rather be a Skittle.

01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:31.206
Hi, uh, do you sell donuts?

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:33.909
My friend and I are here
on a stakeout and we're

01:04:33.911 --> 01:04:35.043
awfully hungry.

01:04:35.045 --> 01:04:38.246
Be a while to ya, darlin'.

01:04:38.248 --> 01:04:41.717
Ah, bring your own donuts.

01:04:41.719 --> 01:04:43.318
That's adorable.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.554
But what you can do, you
can get my friend here

01:04:45.556 --> 01:04:47.222
a large soda pop.

01:04:47.224 --> 01:04:49.325
I'll bring him a coke.

01:04:49.327 --> 01:04:50.992
Yes.

01:04:50.994 --> 01:04:52.228
She went to the bathroom.

01:04:54.931 --> 01:04:56.197
Did I just order you a soda?

01:04:56.199 --> 01:04:58.934
I mean, in this places, you never can tell.

01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:01.936
Elvis is weed, Marilyn
is coke, so we're good.

01:05:01.938 --> 01:05:04.240
Look at you all gritty nitty!

01:05:04.242 --> 01:05:06.275
Gritty nitty.

01:05:07.844 --> 01:05:10.012
All right, seriously. Your Love?

01:05:10.014 --> 01:05:11.213
She's a keeper.

01:05:11.215 --> 01:05:12.782
Yeah...

01:05:12.784 --> 01:05:16.786
I would say I'm pretty
head-over-heels for her.

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:18.287
That's what I've been saying.

01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:19.554
You have been saying that.

01:05:19.556 --> 01:05:20.655
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:20.657 --> 01:05:21.757
She's pretty awesome.

01:05:21.759 --> 01:05:23.793
You're pretty awesome.

01:05:23.795 --> 01:05:27.295
Now, do you think you're up for this?

01:05:27.297 --> 01:05:29.130
SOCOM.

01:05:29.132 --> 01:05:30.465
Call of Duty.

01:05:30.467 --> 01:05:31.266
Oh, yes.

01:05:31.268 --> 01:05:35.037
Counter-fucking-Strike

01:05:35.039 --> 01:05:35.804
Headshot.

01:05:35.806 --> 01:05:37.807
Fuckin' A. Hey!

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:39.842
Dude, you cannot doubt
my wingman capabilities

01:05:39.844 --> 01:05:40.842
or commitment.

01:05:40.844 --> 01:05:42.311
Sweet.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:45.014
I mean, I don't even know if
he's gonna come back or not.

01:05:45.016 --> 01:05:49.017
No matter what, plans
A through C, I'm here.

01:05:49.019 --> 01:05:51.753
Well it's more like a big plan A, you know,

01:05:51.755 --> 01:05:54.889
or nothing, and nothing isn't happening.

01:05:54.891 --> 01:05:56.325
Seven bucks.

01:05:56.327 --> 01:05:58.126
Can we put this on a tab
'cause we're probably gonna

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:01.463
order some more sodas.

01:06:01.465 --> 01:06:02.700
Sure.

01:06:05.335 --> 01:06:07.036
Ah man, thanks.

01:06:07.038 --> 01:06:08.372
Hey!

01:06:11.943 --> 01:06:15.346
That's him right there.

01:06:19.750 --> 01:06:21.749
Hey!

01:06:21.751 --> 01:06:24.787
Hi there, baby!

01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:27.523
You been working out?
You look really strong.

01:06:27.525 --> 01:06:29.291
Oh yeah, that's why I'm all sweaty.

01:06:29.293 --> 01:06:31.894
I've been working out
at the HomeTown Buffet.

01:06:33.563 --> 01:06:35.563
All right, listen, so
keep your eyes on him.

01:06:35.565 --> 01:06:38.400
If he leaves, just give me a call.

01:06:38.402 --> 01:06:40.802
Are you sure you just don't
want me to ride with you?

01:06:40.804 --> 01:06:43.304
No no. I don't want you getting
mixed up with Sonny, man.

01:06:43.306 --> 01:06:44.606
He is bad news.

01:06:44.608 --> 01:06:46.175
Keep your eyes on the goon.

01:06:46.177 --> 01:06:48.376
Give me a call.

01:06:57.554 --> 01:06:58.854
And there it goes!

01:06:58.856 --> 01:07:01.523
It's like David Copperfield.

01:07:01.525 --> 01:07:03.025
The champagne room?

01:07:03.027 --> 01:07:05.693
Ah, but there's no champagne there though!

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.400
I'm gonna need change!

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:25.848
Where is she?

01:07:28.652 --> 01:07:30.786
Your bitch don't even
tell you where she lives.

01:07:30.788 --> 01:07:32.688
Because she stays here.

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:34.889
This is home invasion.

01:07:34.891 --> 01:07:35.891
I'd say in your profession,

01:07:35.893 --> 01:07:37.659
your door should be stronger.

01:07:37.661 --> 01:07:39.796
I shoot trespassers.

01:07:42.065 --> 01:07:43.766
Prince!

01:07:52.376 --> 01:07:54.709
Like you know how to use it.

01:07:54.711 --> 01:07:58.448
Hell, I never even keep it loaded.

01:08:03.153 --> 01:08:05.054
Play a lot of video games, do ya?

01:08:05.056 --> 01:08:07.289
I want the address where you sent her.

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:09.624
Hook up with her, a lot of trouble

01:08:09.626 --> 01:08:11.260
and a lot of debt.

01:08:11.262 --> 01:08:13.329
I'll keep the gun then.

01:08:13.331 --> 01:08:14.630
I've got more.

01:08:14.632 --> 01:08:17.131
I dare you to go for them.

01:08:17.134 --> 01:08:19.535
You know the problem with being a hero?

01:08:19.537 --> 01:08:24.038
Saving everyone else and no
one will watch your own ass.

01:08:24.041 --> 01:08:25.773
You think that I'm not a hero

01:08:25.774 --> 01:08:28.376
'cause I'll have no problem
packin' up and running far away.

01:08:28.377 --> 01:08:30.747
Now give me the fucking address!

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:34.517
Tabby, notebook.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.299
Give me that. Give me the fucking thing.

01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:54.370
I'll be watching your ass.

01:08:55.439 --> 01:08:57.205
The only way you'll see
me again is if this address

01:08:57.207 --> 01:08:59.042
is wrong.

01:09:02.578 --> 01:09:04.846
Where you goin'?

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.915
Shutting the fucking door
before the fucking turtle

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:08.517
gets into the fucking sewer

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.752
and gets teenage fucking mutated.

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:12.821
Sometimes I swear, if you weren't my kid...

01:09:12.823 --> 01:09:14.956
Yeah? You would.

01:09:14.957 --> 01:09:16.759
Yeah, I might.

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:20.995
Come here and give daddy a big wet one.

01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:22.865
All right.

01:09:24.201 --> 01:09:28.536
You see, suspension keeps
the energy at the threshold.

01:09:28.537 --> 01:09:33.642
Spasms can send her back over
the portal and back again.

01:09:33.644 --> 01:09:37.145
So, the alert spirit

01:09:37.148 --> 01:09:41.383
uses that friction to toe the line.

01:09:41.385 --> 01:09:44.318
At least in theory, anyway.

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:46.288
Most just die.

01:09:49.792 --> 01:09:52.095
But you ain't most.

01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:56.865
Why do you wanna work at Wordack?

01:09:56.867 --> 01:09:58.635
I need a job.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:02.638
Our counselors have to deal
with women who are abused,

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:05.973
who have been raped, who
are addicted to drugs.

01:10:05.975 --> 01:10:09.378
It's very serious work, very trying work.

01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:11.979
Yeah I understand that.

01:10:11.981 --> 01:10:14.782
Well generally, we require our employees

01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:17.718
to have a college degree.

01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.822
I don't have that.

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:24.259
And you don't have very
much work experience.

01:10:24.261 --> 01:10:26.794
And no references.

01:10:26.796 --> 01:10:30.934
What makes you think you're
qualified for this position?

01:10:38.074 --> 01:10:41.910
Did you lose your virginity to your father?

01:10:41.912 --> 01:10:43.978
Yeah probably not, huh?

01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:49.250
Fucked is all I got until I
skipped out on high school.

01:10:49.252 --> 01:10:53.388
I saw a way out and I took it.

01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:56.357
Have you ever smoked crack?

01:10:56.359 --> 01:10:57.894
Hm?

01:10:58.962 --> 01:11:01.629
Shot heroine? Snorted coke?

01:11:01.631 --> 01:11:03.632
Stayed up a week on meth
and then took whatever pills

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.032
you could find laying around?

01:11:05.034 --> 01:11:07.835
Not because you were having
fun but because you are

01:11:07.837 --> 01:11:12.307
definitely not having fun.

01:11:12.309 --> 01:11:15.576
What about dressed up in your Sunday best

01:11:15.578 --> 01:11:19.281
to go suck cock for money?

01:11:19.283 --> 01:11:22.017
Only to get blood on it

01:11:22.019 --> 01:11:25.053
because your pimp had his ring on,

01:11:25.055 --> 01:11:28.757
because you handed him wrinkled bills.

01:11:28.759 --> 01:11:31.093
You know and sometimes,
you don't even bother using

01:11:31.095 --> 01:11:34.562
a condom because hey, if you're
lucky you'll catch a disease

01:11:34.564 --> 01:11:39.001
and you might have something
in life and an end in sight.

01:11:41.404 --> 01:11:45.040
Or do you know what it's like
to work a job where any night

01:11:45.042 --> 01:11:48.777
you can end up dead in
an alleyway somewhere?

01:11:48.779 --> 01:11:52.481
Face-down in the dirt, knowing no one,

01:11:52.483 --> 01:11:56.785
no one's gonna give a shit
'cause you don't give a shit.

01:11:56.787 --> 01:12:00.089
Yeah well, I give a shit.

01:12:02.993 --> 01:12:08.330
What makes you think you're
so qualified for this position?

01:12:08.332 --> 01:12:11.101
When would you be available to start?

01:12:18.375 --> 01:12:19.907
Um, Monday?

01:12:19.909 --> 01:12:23.010
Good. We'll set up a drug test.

01:12:23.012 --> 01:12:25.813
Yeah, okay.

01:12:25.815 --> 01:12:28.016
Thanks.

01:12:28.018 --> 01:12:29.250
Good luck.

01:12:29.252 --> 01:12:30.152
Yeah.

01:12:44.100 --> 01:12:48.169
You can only stall until your last breath.

01:14:22.332 --> 01:14:23.833
Okay.

01:14:25.368 --> 01:14:28.870
It's not...

01:14:28.872 --> 01:14:31.673
it's not in my nature

01:14:31.675 --> 01:14:33.974
to go easy

01:14:33.976 --> 01:14:37.812
on anything or anyone.

01:14:37.814 --> 01:14:39.682
But...

01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:45.754
I wanted to give you an advantage.

01:14:45.756 --> 01:14:48.824
It's perfect.

01:14:48.826 --> 01:14:51.393
You, fighting to live...

01:14:54.465 --> 01:14:57.367
and me fighting to die.

01:14:58.569 --> 01:15:01.171
One-on-one
time.

01:15:02.238 --> 01:15:04.339
I'm not fighting for you.

01:15:04.341 --> 01:15:06.843
It wasn't a choice.

01:15:10.847 --> 01:15:12.716
Oh...

01:15:14.251 --> 01:15:16.820
you brought ghosts!

01:15:18.921 --> 01:15:20.589
Ladies.

01:15:44.347 --> 01:15:48.685
They really owe you
enough to finish the job.

01:16:01.664 --> 01:16:02.865
Ah!

01:16:04.701 --> 01:16:06.302
I fucked up!

01:16:08.204 --> 01:16:10.673
I gave 'em peace.

01:16:12.975 --> 01:16:14.410
Oh.

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.949
Is this the last act, lover?

01:18:33.951 --> 01:18:36.084
No!

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.787
No, don't...

01:18:49.365 --> 01:18:50.965
Don't go.

01:18:50.967 --> 01:18:53.168
Don't leave me, come on.

01:18:54.304 --> 01:18:56.071
Come on!

01:19:07.484 --> 01:19:09.718
I need help!

01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:12.920
1807 Fetiga Road.

01:19:12.922 --> 01:19:14.789
Help, please.

01:19:14.791 --> 01:19:16.927
Hurry up!

01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:31.039
You have given me...

01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:33.310
the world.

01:19:46.622 --> 01:19:49.624
Oh, I thought I was gonna lose you.

01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:51.928
Help's on their way right now.

01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:55.832
I love you.

01:20:04.006 --> 01:20:06.007
Nighty night time, little man.

01:20:06.009 --> 01:20:07.608
Daddy loves his baby boy.

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:10.613
Yes he does, yes he does.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:20.190
Again?

01:20:21.792 --> 01:20:24.025
Don't know who the hell you think you are.

01:20:24.027 --> 01:20:25.927
But I am the wrong man to be getting into

01:20:25.929 --> 01:20:27.661
a pissing contest with!

01:20:27.663 --> 01:20:31.234
Now I'm gonna fix that
door right after I fix you!

01:20:33.936 --> 01:20:35.736
Stay away from me.

01:20:35.738 --> 01:20:38.039
Stay away from, stay away from me!

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.075
No! No! No!

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:59.195
Give it back then.

01:21:00.663 --> 01:21:01.730
So...

01:21:02.832 --> 01:21:04.833
where are you goin'?

01:21:06.336 --> 01:21:10.573
Some self-imposed hell with sunshine?

01:21:14.444 --> 01:21:17.845
You know, I could use a new lackey.

01:21:17.847 --> 01:21:21.818
I seemed to have misplaced my last ones.

01:21:22.953 --> 01:21:25.553
Turns out they were
more interested in escape

01:21:25.555 --> 01:21:29.257
than fighting.

01:21:29.259 --> 01:21:31.092
See you don't wanna have to go to this side

01:21:31.094 --> 01:21:33.961
but you do gotta be ready.

01:21:33.963 --> 01:21:37.499
Else you're just a haunting.

01:21:39.235 --> 01:21:41.805
Ghost feign.

01:21:45.274 --> 01:21:48.977
Are you a ghost?

01:21:48.979 --> 01:21:52.281
You haven't grasped any of this, have you?

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.919
Fuckin' hurt me, man.

01:21:57.921 --> 01:22:00.554
Use it.

01:22:00.556 --> 01:22:04.025
Use it to release your fear of the unknown.

01:22:04.027 --> 01:22:05.226
I don't wanna die.

01:22:05.228 --> 01:22:08.428
Well that betters your odds then.

01:22:08.430 --> 01:22:12.634
See if you got what it takes
to join me in revolution.

01:22:12.636 --> 01:22:15.169
Revolting?

01:22:15.171 --> 01:22:17.272
Against what?

01:22:21.778 --> 01:22:25.312
Humanity.

01:22:25.314 --> 01:22:29.651
Shit. You are a ghost.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:32.789
I am hope.

01:22:34.291 --> 01:22:38.893
For God so loved the world
that he fuckin' vanished.

01:22:38.895 --> 01:22:41.062
Me, I hate it.

01:22:41.064 --> 01:22:45.299
I hate it with a passion so strong

01:22:45.301 --> 01:22:47.735
it'll be changed forever.

01:22:47.737 --> 01:22:50.905
Death!

01:22:50.907 --> 01:22:55.143
Death is transition to a new beginning.

01:22:55.145 --> 01:22:57.077
Why?

01:22:57.079 --> 01:22:58.946
Why do you have to come here

01:22:58.948 --> 01:23:01.016
and fuck with me, man?

01:23:02.719 --> 01:23:04.585
Well...

01:23:04.587 --> 01:23:07.621
there's a certain dignity in

01:23:07.623 --> 01:23:12.626
playing avenging angel for that...

01:23:12.628 --> 01:23:15.064
someone special.

01:23:16.533 --> 01:23:18.433
Sonny here is just a
threat to the investment.

01:23:18.435 --> 01:23:21.169
You? You're nothing special.

01:23:21.171 --> 01:23:24.073
No, you are the mind of the masses.

01:23:31.847 --> 01:23:33.848
I'm the mind of the...

01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:36.049
I'm the mind of the masses?

01:23:36.051 --> 01:23:38.354
Mind of the masses.

01:23:39.521 --> 01:23:41.391
All right.

01:23:43.426 --> 01:23:45.395
I got here...

01:23:46.829 --> 01:23:49.062
due to criminal tendencies.

01:23:49.064 --> 01:23:50.599
Aw.

01:23:53.203 --> 01:23:56.437
I never wanted to be a rocket surgeon or,

01:23:56.439 --> 01:24:00.174
a brain scientist, I just
wanted good ol' crooked livin'

01:24:00.176 --> 01:24:02.076
with a little bit of killer butt.

01:24:02.078 --> 01:24:04.178
Mm-hm.

01:24:04.180 --> 01:24:07.281
What I'm doing here, is I
am getting kicked in the ass

01:24:07.283 --> 01:24:10.451
due to lack of ambition
and I am being offered this

01:24:10.453 --> 01:24:15.322
clean slate so long as I
believe that allowing you to...

01:24:15.324 --> 01:24:19.794
flay me is the best way to do that.

01:24:19.796 --> 01:24:21.662
Where am I going?

01:24:21.664 --> 01:24:25.098
Where I'm going is, up in smoke.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.501
I'm gonna get the mind of the masses

01:24:27.503 --> 01:24:30.440
higher than a motherfucker.

01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.582
You don't happen to have a light?

01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:45.955
The world will be made in my image.

01:24:47.222 --> 01:24:51.992
Even if I am the last spirit standing.

01:24:51.994 --> 01:24:55.696
How the fuck do you
know all this shit, man?

01:24:55.698 --> 01:24:59.099
Electroshock intuition.

01:24:59.101 --> 01:25:01.736
But mostly...

01:25:01.738 --> 01:25:04.638
I just make it all up.

01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:11.480
Ah!

01:25:13.515 --> 01:25:16.384
You ready?

01:25:16.386 --> 01:25:18.719
Okay, you can sit down and we'll talk

01:25:18.721 --> 01:25:21.089
and we'll smoke this, come on.

01:25:21.091 --> 01:25:22.925
Let's find a lighter.

01:25:24.860 --> 01:25:29.097
Okay okay okay, we were
talking, that was fine.

01:25:30.132 --> 01:25:32.167
On the downbeat.

01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.171
Five.

01:25:38.173 --> 01:25:39.374
Six.

01:25:39.376 --> 01:25:40.842
Five six seven.
