00:21.280 --> 00:23.408
At this stage, no one
really knows who or what

00:23.420 --> 00:25.560
is responsible for this
gruesome incident.

00:25.760 --> 00:29.840
Several animals have been slain in what
could be described as an occult ritual.

00:30.240 --> 00:32.548
There is no explaining how
these animals were drained

00:32.560 --> 00:34.880
of blood without significant
cuts or injuries.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.600
I'm here with Vidar Hårr who
is in charge of this farm, -

00:38.920 --> 00:41.560
- and Vidar, you awoke
to this nightmare.

00:42.120 --> 00:43.799
Who do you think is responsible?

00:43.800 --> 00:46.880
This is the Devil's work, and
he is not welcome on our farm.

00:47.120 --> 00:50.039
If he returns, I'm gonna pump him
full of lead with this shotgun.

00:50.040 --> 00:51.399
In the name of Jesus.

00:51.400 --> 00:54.239
It's not easy to get to the
bottom of this, ehh...

00:54.240 --> 00:56.399
The circumstances
are quite absurd.

00:56.400 --> 00:59.880
At this stage, we have yet to
acquire any serious information.

01:00.320 --> 01:01.960
What do you mean by "serious"?

01:02.240 --> 01:03.320
Ehh...

01:03.680 --> 01:04.879
Seriously!

01:04.879 --> 01:06.960
I woke up in the middle
of a pentagram, -

01:07.680 --> 01:09.799
- turned my head to the
right, and behold...

01:09.800 --> 01:11.680
a sheep.

01:12.400 --> 01:15.799
Then, I turned my head to
the left, and behold...

01:15.800 --> 01:17.399
yet another sheep.

01:17.400 --> 01:18.719
They were both dead.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.120
What went through your mind?

01:20.920 --> 01:21.960
Are these our sheep?

01:22.200 --> 01:23.720
Don't eat the microphone!

01:24.040 --> 01:25.120
Were they your sheep?

01:25.280 --> 01:26.120
They were.

01:26.121 --> 01:29.039
'Every Sunday members of 'The
Children of Creation', -'

01:29.040 --> 01:33.679
- an extremely conservative Christian
congregation, gather for worship.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.440
Today, they are preparing an attack against
the evil that has struck their community.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.880
'We will pray strenuously
for the Hårrs.'

01:42.800 --> 01:46.520
Through prayer we will build a divine
fence around their farmstead, -

01:47.080 --> 01:49.160
- on top of blessing
the livestock.

01:50.040 --> 01:53.839
'We hope these measures will deflect
any further satanic attacks.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.960
'And they will. Jesus
is on our side.'

02:03.880 --> 02:05.880
Vidar, why are we watching this?

02:08.560 --> 02:11.080
I just wanted to prepare you.

02:13.440 --> 02:15.000
Prepare me?

02:16.080 --> 02:19.360
Yeah. This story won't
make any fucking sense.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.160
Why would you say that?

02:28.800 --> 02:31.080
'Cause I'm not right in
the head, that's why.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.680
I no longer know what's up or
down; what's right or wrong.

02:35.840 --> 02:37.760
When am I dreaming?
What's reality?

02:38.520 --> 02:40.199
I've lost my fucking marbles!

02:40.200 --> 02:41.759
That's Why I'm here, right?

02:41.760 --> 02:45.160
To see if you can help me
out, straighten my head, -

02:45.640 --> 02:47.800
- fix me, if at all possible.

02:51.200 --> 02:52.960
Nothing is impossible.

02:54.680 --> 02:58.399
The best way to go about this would
be for you to tell your story, -

02:58.400 --> 03:01.880
- and together we can work out whether
or not this story makes any sense.

03:03.120 --> 03:04.400
Does that make sense?

03:07.080 --> 03:10.360
Fine. Where do we start?

03:11.440 --> 03:13.160
From the beginning
is usually best.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.600
From the very beginning?

03:16.040 --> 03:19.520
Where I was born, grew
up, that sort of stuff?

03:20.520 --> 03:22.439
Or shall we begin when I
was born into darkness...

03:22.440 --> 03:24.960
Start wherever you like, Vidar.

03:27.520 --> 03:28.520
Very well.

03:30.720 --> 03:31.720
Okay.

03:35.280 --> 03:39.359
It was an ordinary day...

03:39.360 --> 03:42.839
and as usual it started
at the break of dawn.

03:42.840 --> 03:46.800
You should know, I've never
been a morning person, -

03:47.800 --> 03:49.520
'- and I never will be.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.599
'But as a farmer you
have no choice.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.680
'There's too much
shit to be done.'

04:15.880 --> 04:18.399
Shut the fuck up!

04:55.600 --> 04:59.880
Free time is drinking time.

05:01.240 --> 05:06.160
And drinking time is angst time.

05:07.200 --> 05:12.160
And angst time, yeah,
that's my time.

05:13.000 --> 05:18.160
So, my time is best
without free time.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.120
Slow and steady wins the race!

05:31.680 --> 05:36.360
Work time is a dull time.

05:37.480 --> 05:42.480
And a dull time is a grave time.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.160
And a grave time, yeah,
that's my time <i>B.</i>

05:48.800 --> 05:54.200
So, my time is best
without work time.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.040
Night time is a good time <i>B.</i>

06:12.840 --> 06:17.960
And a good time is free time.

06:18.520 --> 06:23.320
Yeah, free time, yeah,
that's my time.

06:24.240 --> 06:29.560
Yet, my time is best
without free time.

07:30.520 --> 07:32.120
Why weren't you in church?

07:32.560 --> 07:35.080
I had to work. Mom's
not feeling well.

07:35.680 --> 07:37.559
Thou shalt keep
the Sabbath holy.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.320
Thou shalt SHUT YOUR FACE!

07:42.240 --> 07:43.680
What do you want?

07:44.320 --> 07:46.960
Karin wants to ask
you something.

07:53.440 --> 07:54.320
Then I will ask.

07:54.321 --> 07:57.360
Would you like to go...
steady with Karin?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.600
I thought you were going
steady with Jonas.

08:01.760 --> 08:04.000
They broke up. She wants
to be with you now.

08:05.760 --> 08:06.760
For real?

08:07.120 --> 08:09.000
Do you want to go steady or not?

08:11.440 --> 08:13.520
I don't really know.

08:16.600 --> 08:17.880
Don't you want to?

08:19.120 --> 08:21.560
Sure, I guess I do.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.040
Say yes, then.

08:24.920 --> 08:25.960
Very well.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.440
Come join us outside.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.400
Okay.

08:40.280 --> 08:42.799
God, I'm bound for the meadows.

08:42.799 --> 08:45.360
<i>B</i> To drown all of my sorrows.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.119
Dirty water will
swallow me whole.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.480
And in silence I will go down

08:51.360 --> 08:53.639
<i>n</i> I have to go,
please understand

08:53.640 --> 08:56.000
<i>n</i> I need get there
as soon as I can.

08:56.920 --> 08:59.119
All my hardships are overcome

08:59.120 --> 09:01.280
<i>41 The gates of heaven
are open to me D</i>

09:02.160 --> 09:04.800
<i>n</i> 80, if you see me
hop-skipping away.

09:05.160 --> 09:07.360
Singing all to myself.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.319
Tell my mom I attempted to give

09:10.320 --> 09:12.600
<i>n</i> A legacy to my son.

09:13.440 --> 09:15.640
God, I'm bound for the meadows.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.520
<i>B</i> To drown all of my sorrows.

09:19.040 --> 09:21.239
Dirty water will
swallow me whole.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.160
And in silence I will go down.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.360
Did you really think Karin
wanted to go steady with you?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.480
You will never get a girlfriend.

09:39.520 --> 09:40.679
Fucking farmer!

09:40.680 --> 09:41.840
Stop crying!

09:42.080 --> 09:44.079
Run home to your mama!

09:44.080 --> 09:45.680
Oh, Lord!

09:50.560 --> 09:52.799
I dare not wait any longer.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.160
While Jesus is still by my side

09:55.880 --> 09:58.319
<i>n</i> The pearly gates
will be open to me.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.960
Although some folks
will disagree.

10:01.640 --> 10:03.720
God, I'm bound for the meadows.

10:04.080 --> 10:06.720
<i>B</i> To drown all of my sorrows.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.400
Dirty water will
swallow me whole.

10:09.640 --> 10:12.720
And in silence I will go down.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.680
'Vidar, is that you?'

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
Yes.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.360
'Who rang the doorbell earlier?'

10:20.120 --> 10:21.720
Some kids from church.

10:21.920 --> 10:23.000
'What'd they want?'

10:24.680 --> 10:25.400
Nothing.

10:25.560 --> 10:27.400
'Could you get me a
glass of water?'

10:35.560 --> 10:37.000
What's that?

10:40.040 --> 10:41.360
Water.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.359
Did you close the tap?

10:53.360 --> 10:54.360
Mmhm.

10:55.640 --> 10:57.159
Turn on the cooling?

10:57.160 --> 10:58.160
Yes.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.119
Tuck in the pigs?

11:03.120 --> 11:05.200
I've taken care of everything.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.840
You're a good boy, Vidar.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.680
Remember your bedtime prayers.

11:26.320 --> 11:27.320
YES.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.039
'If you truly exist...

11:32.040 --> 11:33.479
'If you can hear my prayers, -'

11:33.480 --> 11:36.720
- you have to wake me from
this fucking nightmare!

11:37.760 --> 11:39.319
I can't take this anymore.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.280
I hate my life!

11:42.000 --> 11:46.280
I'm 33 years old, god damnit, and
I still live at home with my mom.

11:48.200 --> 11:49.200
I want out!

11:50.240 --> 11:51.760
All I ever do is work.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.280
I want to live freely.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.360
I want to drink, fuck and fight!

11:58.400 --> 12:03.000
I want to taste a variety of
women in their twenties and up.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.200
Twenty plus.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.240
Amen.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.760
Come.

14:47.520 --> 14:51.680
'Ask and it will
be given to you; -

14:53.880 --> 14:57.880
'- seek and you will find.'

17:29.000 --> 17:31.039
Who turned on the
fucking lights?

17:31.040 --> 17:34.480
'I did.'

17:35.560 --> 17:36.800
Who am I?

17:37.080 --> 17:42.520
'I am the Alpha and the Omega,
the First and the Last.

17:43.000 --> 17:47.280
'I am the Living One; I was dead, and
now look, I am alive forever and ever!'

17:47.560 --> 17:48.639
I can't see shit.

17:48.640 --> 17:53.080
'Fear ye not! Soon you will see
the world through brand new eyes.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.720
'He who has Christ in
him is a new creature:

17:58.440 --> 18:02.440
'Old things are passed away;
all things are become new.

18:03.840 --> 18:06.239
'I have come into the
world as a light; -

18:06.240 --> 18:10.000
'- that you may have life,
and have it to the full.'

18:11.040 --> 18:17.560
Do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

18:18.280 --> 18:21.960
Lord, save me!

18:32.440 --> 18:34.240
This is my body.

18:36.040 --> 18:37.239
Open wide...

18:37.240 --> 18:41.960
and eat!

18:45.880 --> 18:49.960
Whoever eats my flesh and drinks
my blood remains in me, -

18:50.760 --> 18:52.640
- and I remain in them.

18:55.280 --> 18:58.240
I'm sorry. Let me see
if I got this straight.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.280
What you're telling
me is that...

19:02.920 --> 19:05.200
you accepted Jesus?

19:06.280 --> 19:10.440
I accepted the body of Christ;
I became one with Jesus.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.279
And, Jesus himself was there?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.120
In person, -

19:16.840 --> 19:18.039
- violated you orally, -

19:18.040 --> 19:21.359
- before offering his blood.
The blood of the covenant...

19:21.360 --> 19:22.480
to you?

19:23.080 --> 19:26.040
And this took place
in your <i>mom's</i> barn?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.439
Yes.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.680
That's right.

19:40.720 --> 19:45.640
Yeah... I'm a little hesitant
to ask what happened next -

19:45.880 --> 19:48.720
- after you... accepted Jesus.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.080
I got sick.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.360
Okay?

20:09.320 --> 20:11.680
'I tried everything:

20:12.080 --> 20:14.520
Traditional medicine,
modern medicine, -

20:15.040 --> 20:18.759
'- strong medicine,
herbal medicine.'

20:18.760 --> 20:23.160
I tried physical therapy,
light therapy, homeopathy.

20:23.440 --> 20:25.160
I tried healing.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.839
I tried everything.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.440
Nothing worked.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.439
'I fell deeper and
deeper into darkness.

20:31.440 --> 20:34.400
'Slouched around indoors
like a fucking sloth.“

20:34.560 --> 20:37.559
Had to hire a contract
worker to maintain the farm.

20:37.560 --> 20:40.880
'In the end I was so weak; I
could barely stand up straight.'

20:42.760 --> 20:44.520
Luckily, my mom
came to the rescue.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.120
'She knew the way to salvation.'

21:02.640 --> 21:04.839
'My dear fellowship...'

21:04.840 --> 21:06.960
'..a most wonderful
Sunday to you all.'

21:07.520 --> 21:11.360
I must confess, my heart is filled
with joy by today's great attendance.

21:12.600 --> 21:17.720
But, I guess that is to be expected as we
are graced by the presence of celebrity.

21:19.360 --> 21:22.799
Our guest has traveled, by train,
all the way from Kristiansand -

21:22.800 --> 21:26.120
- in order to help brother Vidar,
who's struggling with health issues.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.440
Hallelujah.

21:28.200 --> 21:31.640
A most heartfelt welcome
to Tor Magne Abrahamsen.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.200
Hallelujah!

21:37.400 --> 21:38.960
Hallelujah!

21:42.480 --> 21:43.840
Thank you very much.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.960
God bless you, Tor Magne!

21:46.280 --> 21:47.560
Right back at you!

21:49.880 --> 21:51.160
Hallelujah.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.760
HALLELUJAH!

21:56.920 --> 21:59.639
My thanks to 'The
Children of Creation' -

21:59.640 --> 22:03.760
- for this wonderful opportunity to
practice God's almighty medicine.

22:04.400 --> 22:07.559
Right, as you can see, the offering
bag is being passed around.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.839
Salvation, unfortunately,
doesn't come free.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.559
Notes are better than coins.

22:11.560 --> 22:12.759
Hallelujah.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.039
Hallelujah.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.160
Yeah. All jokes aside.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.559
Shall we pray to God above...?

22:19.560 --> 22:20.599
Yeah.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.439
To help, -

22:22.440 --> 22:24.320
- and to heal...

22:24.800 --> 22:27.479
Vidar's corrupted soul.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.760
Yeah!

22:29.000 --> 22:30.359
Shall we pray to God?!

22:30.360 --> 22:31.840
'YEAH!'

22:32.200 --> 22:33.560
Then, let's do this.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.079
Dear Jesus...

22:37.080 --> 22:38.559
Dear Jesus.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.200
Lord Jesus.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.400
Jesus, -

22:44.920 --> 22:47.039
- may your power -

22:47.040 --> 22:48.679
- penetrate...

22:48.680 --> 22:51.160
Vidar's corrupted soul.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.679
Hallelujah.

22:54.680 --> 22:56.080
Hallelujah!

22:56.320 --> 23:00.280
I claim authority
over all suffering:

23:01.640 --> 23:02.800
Borreliosis, -

23:03.040 --> 23:03.680
- AIDS, -

23:03.681 --> 23:04.719
- all forms of cancer, -

23:04.720 --> 23:06.159
- all heart disease, -

23:06.160 --> 23:06.920
- porphyria, -

23:06.921 --> 23:08.320
- fibromyalgia, -

23:08.520 --> 23:09.840
- homophilia...

23:10.480 --> 23:12.440
all suffering!

23:13.200 --> 23:15.160
Yeah, hallelujah!

23:15.880 --> 23:18.239
- YEAH, HALLELUJAH!
- Hallelujah!

23:18.240 --> 23:22.080
CHASE THE DEVIL OUT OF HIS BODY!

23:22.320 --> 23:23.439
HALLELUJAH!

23:23.440 --> 23:26.760
YEAH, OUT! OUT OF HIS BODY!

23:27.520 --> 23:31.040
Out of his body. Hallelujah!

23:37.440 --> 23:38.720
Yes.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.000
Yes.

23:46.560 --> 23:48.359
I have Jesus on the line.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.239
Oh... Oh, hallelujah!

23:50.240 --> 23:53.360
It's Tor Magne, Jesus.
Speak to me, speak to me.

23:53.840 --> 23:54.840
Yes.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.800
He says:

23:58.640 --> 24:00.960
"“I am the light of the World."

24:02.480 --> 24:03.520
Jesus.

24:03.880 --> 24:09.720
“He who walks in the light shall
not fall into darkness, -

24:10.600 --> 24:12.320
- but follow <i>me.“</i>

24:12.560 --> 24:13.840
Jesus.

24:15.280 --> 24:16.600
'It's obvious.

24:17.000 --> 24:19.599
Jesus is the light!

24:19.600 --> 24:21.200
YEAH!

24:22.240 --> 24:25.040
Cast the Devil out!

24:26.080 --> 24:28.280
Out! Out! Out!

24:33.240 --> 24:37.719
Let Jesus take the wheel, Vidar!

24:37.720 --> 24:39.239
Yeah!

24:39.240 --> 24:41.319
Yeah! Hallelujah!

24:41.320 --> 24:47.120
Seize the day. Bathe
in heavenly light.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.520
Amen.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.119
Amen.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.520
Jesus... Jesus...

24:55.120 --> 24:56.960
Your soul shall be cleansed.

24:58.120 --> 25:01.320
Cast away the shadow
of The Beast.

25:05.000 --> 25:07.480
HOLY HEEEEEEEEE...

25:11.240 --> 25:13.960
So, you wear this suit
on a daily basis?

25:15.560 --> 25:20.200
Ehh, no. I usually
sleep during the day.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.440
I don't always wear... this.

25:24.160 --> 25:26.399
Because you're
allergic to sunlight?

25:26.400 --> 25:28.040
Something like that.

25:31.320 --> 25:34.359
So, let's imagine...

25:34.360 --> 25:38.159
You leave here today
without wearing your suit.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.760
What would happen?

25:40.080 --> 25:42.880
Then it all goes
straight to hell.

25:43.760 --> 25:45.720
How so?

25:46.640 --> 25:48.480
I get severely sunburnt.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.120
ARE WE THERE YET?!?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.560
Vidar?

26:43.680 --> 26:44.960
Vidar'?!

26:45.480 --> 26:47.840
Help! Help!

26:55.480 --> 26:59.600
“Until we meet again, Vidar...

27:11.240 --> 27:13.000
Today is a sad day.

27:13.840 --> 27:17.000
Our congregation has lost
a most beloved child.

27:18.080 --> 27:21.760
A mother has lost her
one and only son.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.520
A good son and an even
better Christian.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.320
An unselfish,
hard-working farmer -

27:29.880 --> 27:34.080
- who sacrificed blood and sweat in
order to cultivate God's pastures.

27:40.040 --> 27:42.640
He nurtured God's creations.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.679
He provided for his family.

27:44.680 --> 27:47.120
He took care of the
ones he loved.

27:48.080 --> 27:52.960
Dear Vidar, you have without a doubt
earned a place in the Kingdom of Heaven.

27:53.440 --> 28:00.040
What a friend we have in Jesus.

28:00.320 --> 28:05.760
All our sins and griefs to bear.

28:07.000 --> 28:13.200
What a privilege to carry.

28:13.920 --> 28:20.040
Everything to God in prayer.

28:22.360 --> 28:25.040
From the earth you have come.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.640
Back to the earth you shall go.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.480
From the earth you
will rise again.

28:56.640 --> 29:01.680
"Our Lord, Jesus Christ says: “I
am the resurrection and the life."

29:02.640 --> 29:05.520
"The one who believes in me will
live, even though they die.“"

30:55.840 --> 30:57.240
Run home to your mama!

32:01.320 --> 32:04.360
I drive a car.

32:06.080 --> 32:09.320
This is my steed

32:11.000 --> 32:15.599
<i>n</i> I drive around and about.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.840
At cruising speed

32:20.320 --> 32:23.480
<i>41 My senses are sharpened 41</i>

32:24.920 --> 32:27.960
<i>n</i> I have no cargo.

32:29.760 --> 32:32.800
Drifting through Jaeren.

32:33.640 --> 32:37.760
My steed goes where
the wind blows

32:39.000 --> 32:42.240
<i>n I'm “m the zone 41</i>

32:43.880 --> 32:46.480
I'm all alone.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.760
MOM!

32:50.480 --> 32:52.200
LET ME IN!

32:54.240 --> 32:55.680
MOM!??

32:56.040 --> 32:58.120
WHY IS THE DOOR LOCKED?!

33:01.000 --> 33:02.360
MOOOM!!'??

33:04.000 --> 33:05.160
MOM!!!

33:27.920 --> 33:29.440
Didn't you hear me?

33:31.680 --> 33:32.919
What's with the shotgun?

33:32.920 --> 33:35.280
AWAY FROM ME, SATAN!

34:22.760 --> 34:25.280
'Drink and drain it dry, my son.

34:26.760 --> 34:29.000
'You must retain
tendon strength.

34:31.679 --> 34:35.120
'Whoever serves me
must follow me...

34:37.800 --> 34:41.000
'- and our throne shall
be in the city.'

34:55.440 --> 34:57.440
'How long have you
lived in Stavanger?'

34:57.920 --> 34:59.320
Long enough.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.680
It doesn't sound like
you're thriving.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.360
It was cool when I
first got here.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.359
Everything was new and exciting.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.320
Lots of people - lots of noise.

35:14.400 --> 35:20.119
But I've tasted all this city has to offer
and I simply can't stomach it anymore.

35:20.120 --> 35:21.680
I can't!

35:23.760 --> 35:25.640
So, Why don't you move back?

35:26.320 --> 35:28.480
Why don't I move back?

35:30.440 --> 35:35.840
"“A prophet has no honor in his own
town, nor in his own house..."

35:37.160 --> 35:39.240
and in my case: anywhere.

35:42.200 --> 35:45.520
You used the word "to taste".

35:48.040 --> 35:49.480
To taste?

35:50.280 --> 35:55.680
Yes, you said: 'I've tasted
all this city has to offer.”

35:57.640 --> 35:59.320
What do you mean by that?

36:00.720 --> 36:02.480
That should be pretty
self-explanatory...

36:03.080 --> 36:06.280
You're going to taste
a variety of women...

36:06.640 --> 36:08.600
- in their twenties and up.

36:09.760 --> 36:10.799
I am?

36:10.800 --> 36:13.040
Yes! Twenty plus.

36:13.840 --> 36:15.399
For real?

36:15.400 --> 36:17.360
Yes, for real.

36:18.400 --> 36:20.160
What else do you want
me to do, Vidar?

36:20.320 --> 36:22.440
Do I need to walk on water?

36:23.200 --> 36:26.240
I've raised you from
the dead, god damnit!

36:26.880 --> 36:29.479
Two fucking times already.

36:29.480 --> 36:32.028
That alone should give
you a massive hard-on,

36:32.040 --> 36:34.600
but you're just sitting
there like a limp dick.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.200
You're a frightened little lamb.

36:37.440 --> 36:41.760
You've choked your natural
instincts for 20 fucking years!

36:42.000 --> 36:43.760
What the fuck!?

36:44.280 --> 36:46.320
It's totally insane.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.880
We can't go on like this.

36:50.280 --> 36:51.320
No-

36:51.880 --> 36:54.348
It's about time you started
worshiping the pleasures

36:54.360 --> 36:56.839
of life, instead of
practicing abstinence.

36:56.840 --> 36:58.399
Fuck abstinence.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.440
We are all animals, Vidar.

37:00.840 --> 37:02.600
I'm an animal.

37:03.120 --> 37:06.480
You are also an animal, and
the pastures are out there.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.760
Could you do me a favor?

37:12.200 --> 37:13.639
What?

37:13.640 --> 37:18.600
Grow some balls and go
through the wide gate.

37:22.120 --> 37:25.640
'I have drunk the wine of wrath
from Babylon's fornication.

37:25.800 --> 37:30.160
'I have sullied myself with
snakes, rats, and whores.

37:30.400 --> 37:32.888
'I'm so fucking dirty
that I'll never get rid

37:32.900 --> 37:35.400
of the stench, no matter
how many times I wash.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.400
'I've walked through the gate
that leads to destruction.

37:40.560 --> 37:42.600
'There is no turning back.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.760
'I can only move forward.'

37:53.120 --> 37:54.160
Vidar.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.480
Vidar!

37:58.640 --> 37:59.960
Vidar.

38:02.120 --> 38:04.200
Listen!

38:04.400 --> 38:04.880
Yes?

38:04.881 --> 38:07.800
He Who welcomes me
welcomes you...

38:08.440 --> 38:11.839
- and he who welcomes you welcomes...
ehh, wait a sec...

38:11.840 --> 38:13.599
He who welcomes me...

38:13.600 --> 38:16.799
- ehh, no homo, welcomes
the one who sent you...

38:16.800 --> 38:19.400
- and the one who sent you...

38:20.200 --> 38:21.880
Ah, fuck that... look!

38:22.200 --> 38:23.839
Never mind... forget about it.

38:23.840 --> 38:27.640
Take this, get in there and
tell her the Lord has sent you.

38:27.840 --> 38:29.760
Understood? You ready?

38:37.720 --> 38:38.680
Eh, thanks.

38:38.681 --> 38:40.320
You're welcome.

38:48.480 --> 38:49.919
KNOCK...!

38:49.920 --> 38:52.400
And the door will
be opened to you.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.879
The Lord has sent me.

39:07.880 --> 39:09.600
Jesus fucking Christ...

39:10.840 --> 39:12.200
Come in.

39:13.240 --> 39:16.028
'He had a fucking harem
filled with high class

39:16.040 --> 39:18.840
hookers, or harlots as
he referred to them...'

39:19.760 --> 39:22.720
- and technically speaking, it
was a hotel room, not a harem.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.588
'I only say this because
every time I came

39:25.600 --> 39:28.079
knocking I was greeted
by a new piece of meat.

39:28.080 --> 39:31.760
'But all the flesh was covered
by the same disguise.'

39:35.760 --> 39:39.680
It was hard to tell them all apart.
If you know what I'm saying?

39:47.040 --> 39:49.200
Have we met before?

39:50.440 --> 39:53.160
Maybe in your dreams?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.719
Where would you like to bite me?

40:13.720 --> 40:15.640
Right between the legs.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.960
Yes...

40:21.120 --> 40:22.400
Yes.

40:25.440 --> 40:29.800
Vidar, I would like to try
something, if that's ok with you?

40:31.200 --> 40:32.359
What?

40:32.360 --> 40:34.559
I want to show you a
series of abstract images.

40:34.560 --> 40:38.320
All you have to do is
tell me what you see.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.280
I don't see any harm in that.

40:43.840 --> 40:46.039
But before I get
them, I need to ask.

40:46.040 --> 40:47.640
I hope it's ok...

40:52.240 --> 40:54.519
Well?

40:54.520 --> 40:56.400
How was it?

41:00.080 --> 41:02.400
It was totally nuts.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.960
I've never experienced
anything like it.

41:07.400 --> 41:09.159
She was...

41:09.160 --> 41:12.199
She was downright dark as night.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.120
Dark as night.

41:14.440 --> 41:16.039
Where I'm from...

41:16.040 --> 41:18.039
Small town...

41:18.040 --> 41:20.759
There's not a single
black person.

41:20.760 --> 41:22.199
Not one.

41:22.200 --> 41:25.319
However, I heard that in
the next town over...

41:25.320 --> 41:28.039
'They' walk to the
train station...

41:28.040 --> 41:30.160
but then 'they' ride bikes home.

41:35.920 --> 41:39.040
This one won't remember
much come morning.

41:43.360 --> 41:46.839
Let's get out of here. I can't
stand this fucking China-music.

41:46.840 --> 41:47.800
What about me?

41:47.800 --> 41:48.320
No, no, no.

41:48.321 --> 41:49.399
I was looking forward to this.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.159
Calm yourself!

41:51.160 --> 41:53.720
There are certain rules
we must adhere to.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.159
First and foremost:

41:59.160 --> 42:01.960
Without blood, you
have no life in you.

42:03.000 --> 42:03.400
Right.

42:03.401 --> 42:06.000
But that doesn't justify
getting shit-faced.

42:07.880 --> 42:12.280
Stop consuming before it affects the heart.
Now, that's a good rule of thumb.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.080
Right.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.840
Secondly...

42:17.280 --> 42:19.879
Regarding vintage,
you should be aware:

42:19.880 --> 42:23.719
Anything past 30
tastes fucking awful.

42:23.720 --> 42:25.679
- Are you following me?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:25.680 --> 42:27.919
And thirdly...

42:27.920 --> 42:30.120
You know this one:

42:31.040 --> 42:33.880
Be kind to those who deserve it.

42:34.600 --> 42:37.840
Don't waste love
on the unworthy.

42:39.760 --> 42:41.279
Cruising for pussycat.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.039
Here, kitty, kitty.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.199
Come with me to Paradise City.

42:45.200 --> 42:47.479
On the terrace, rolling
up that diggy.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.840
Call me Big Popa,
put on some Biggie

42:50.920 --> 42:52.519
<i>41 Yeah, crank up that bass 41</i>

42:52.520 --> 42:55.279
<i>41 Me and my homes are
down for the chase 41.</i>

42:55.280 --> 42:57.519
City chicks make
them boys go crazy.

42:57.520 --> 42:59.039
Wicked smile, wicked style.

42:59.040 --> 43:00.799
Oh, baby, baby.

43:00.800 --> 43:03.199
Cobblestone music
from alleyways.

43:03.200 --> 43:05.840
Stavanger, many
colours she displays

43:06.560 --> 43:09.039
<i>41 My city has many
flavours, that we savour 41</i>

43:09.040 --> 43:11.119
<i>41 On never-ending
summer days 41.</i>

43:11.120 --> 43:12.919
And the evenings are merry.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.840
With a case of Corona and
a mouthful of cherries.

43:16.080 --> 43:18.039
Feet swinging from the docks.

43:18.040 --> 43:20.599
Waiting for that take-out
that simply rocks.

43:20.600 --> 43:23.119
Come with me down
to Paradise City.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.719
Where the grass is green
and the women are pretty

43:25.720 --> 43:28.239
Nike Air, Dickies,
start to get jiggy

43:28.240 --> 43:30.679
<i>41 Come with me down
to Bunny Town 41.</i>

43:30.680 --> 43:32.080
Come with me down to Paradise...

43:34.200 --> 43:36.960
and stay the fuck out!

43:41.320 --> 43:43.800
Oh, Vidar. Keep at it!

43:55.720 --> 43:57.519
This is good shit!

43:57.520 --> 44:00.120
Techno, Vidar,
wasn't available BC.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.519
Can you feel it?

44:01.520 --> 44:03.679
Can you feel it in your johnson?

44:03.680 --> 44:04.719
Are you psyched!?

44:04.720 --> 44:05.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

44:05.561 --> 44:06.599
CAN YOU FEEL IT?!

44:06.600 --> 44:08.639
Yes, yes! Watch
where you're going!

44:08.640 --> 44:09.960
I am watching!

44:10.160 --> 44:16.240
I am the way, and the truth,
and the lifeeeeeeeeee...

44:21.840 --> 44:25.839
<i>n</i> This love can
never see the sun.

44:25.840 --> 44:29.639
Only lives in the
dark by the moonlight

44:29.640 --> 44:34.159
<i>n</i> This love's a
locked up loaded gun

44:34.160 --> 44:37.719
<i>n</i> 80 wrong, so wrong,
but it's so right.

44:37.720 --> 44:41.720
And in the night we'll never die

44:42.160 --> 44:46.120
<i>n</i> This love, this
love is a vampire.

45:01.560 --> 45:03.640
'Goddamnit'

45:12.520 --> 45:14.720
Women suck!

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
'What did you say?'

45:16.881 --> 45:19.279
I said, you are very pretty.

45:19.280 --> 45:20.800
Thank you.

45:27.880 --> 45:29.880
How old are you?

45:30.720 --> 45:32.000
Twenty-one.

45:32.160 --> 45:33.440
Oohh!

45:34.120 --> 45:35.560
Twenty plus.

45:36.840 --> 45:38.280
Yeeeaaah.

45:38.800 --> 45:39.800
Yeah.

45:41.920 --> 45:43.840
What are you doing later?

45:44.520 --> 45:46.039
I'm going home...

45:46.040 --> 45:47.359
alone.

45:47.360 --> 45:48.720
Oh-

45:49.520 --> 45:51.880
Why are you being cranky?

45:54.160 --> 45:55.160
Hello?

45:55.640 --> 45:57.560
Why are you being cranky?

45:59.080 --> 46:01.559
You should answer when
asked a question.

46:01.560 --> 46:02.320
Why are you being...

46:02.321 --> 46:04.320
Now, witness something
truly amazing!

46:04.520 --> 46:05.640
Finally, you're back.

46:05.800 --> 46:08.320
Blessed is he who comes
in the name of the Lord.

46:08.680 --> 46:10.840
I've filled this glass
with water, right?

46:11.440 --> 46:12.759
Does anyone want water?

46:12.760 --> 46:13.680
No!

46:13.681 --> 46:14.919
That's What I thought.

46:14.920 --> 46:16.320
Watch this!

46:17.400 --> 46:19.800
I will display my splendor.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.879
Alright...

46:24.880 --> 46:26.399
Make it so.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.680
BOOM!

46:31.160 --> 46:32.000
Is that wine?

46:32.000 --> 46:32.360
It's Wine.

46:32.360 --> 46:32.920
Is that wine?!

46:32.920 --> 46:33.440
It's Wine.

46:33.440 --> 46:34.120
Is that wine?!?

46:34.121 --> 46:35.519
Of course it's wine.

46:35.520 --> 46:36.280
Seriously!'?

46:36.281 --> 46:37.919
Give it a taste.

46:37.920 --> 46:38.520
You're kidding?

46:38.521 --> 46:40.520
Not at all. Taste!

46:43.840 --> 46:44.560
It's Wine!

46:44.561 --> 46:46.239
It's wine. It really is wine.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.080
'Vidar?'

46:47.080 --> 46:47.800
'How did you..'

46:47.801 --> 46:49.319
'Vidar!?'

46:49.320 --> 46:51.080
'What do you see?“

46:51.800 --> 46:52.960
<i>Beaver.</i>

47:03.120 --> 47:04.960
Bat.

47:17.000 --> 47:18.280
Mmm... beaver?

47:31.800 --> 47:33.200
Bat.

47:34.560 --> 47:36.280
Bat?

47:37.400 --> 47:39.000
No, wait!

47:41.360 --> 47:42.560
Beaver...

47:43.440 --> 47:45.200
Definitely beaver.

47:46.320 --> 47:48.080
The fuck you looking at?

47:49.120 --> 47:50.480
Nothing.

48:07.280 --> 48:08.599
Hanging out?

48:08.600 --> 48:09.919
Don't even bother.

48:09.920 --> 48:10.880
What?

48:10.881 --> 48:12.639
Don't bother!

48:12.640 --> 48:14.999
I have a boyfriend, ok.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.320
Yeah, ok.

48:17.080 --> 48:18.600
Where is he, then?

48:18.760 --> 48:20.600
The fuck if I know?!

48:21.760 --> 48:23.160
So he...

48:23.680 --> 48:25.039
He just left you here?

48:25.040 --> 48:26.919
He'll be here soon, 0k.

48:26.920 --> 48:28.040
Yeah, ok...

48:29.320 --> 48:32.239
And in the meantime you're
sitting here eating a burger?

48:32.240 --> 48:34.280
- Yeah.
- ..all by yourself?

48:36.480 --> 48:39.079
I'll tell you, if I
were your boyfriend...

48:39.080 --> 48:41.320
You would never be my boyfriend!

48:41.720 --> 48:43.719
Why would you say that?

48:43.720 --> 48:45.559
“Why would you say that?”

48:45.560 --> 48:47.039
Jesus, look at yourself.

48:47.040 --> 48:49.000
Eww, you're disgusting.

48:49.400 --> 48:51.439
Nasty face and...

48:51.440 --> 48:55.239
Wearing farm overalls
on a night out?

48:55.240 --> 48:57.120
It's the middle of winter.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.399
Aren't you cold
wearing no pants?

48:59.400 --> 49:01.039
That was uncalled-for.

49:01.040 --> 49:01.680
What?

49:01.681 --> 49:03.319
That was totally uncalled-for!

49:03.320 --> 49:04.040
What?!

49:04.041 --> 49:05.960
I won't tolerate this.

49:07.520 --> 49:11.168
Can't I wear whatever I
please without worrying

49:11.180 --> 49:14.840
about dirty old pigs like
you staring at my pussy?

49:15.520 --> 49:18.079
I wasn't staring at your pussy.

49:18.080 --> 49:19.799
Yes, you were staring
at my pussy.

49:19.800 --> 49:21.399
No, I wasn't. - Yes, you were!

49:21.400 --> 49:24.159
You were staring at my pussy
when I was sitting right there.

49:24.160 --> 49:24.920
I saw you.

49:24.921 --> 49:25.999
No, I did not.

49:26.000 --> 49:26.880
Yes.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.439
You stared right at my pussy!

49:28.440 --> 49:29.719
No, I didn't stare
at your pussy.

49:29.720 --> 49:30.759
You sat there...

49:30.760 --> 49:32.039
and I sat there.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.040
And you were staring, -

49:33.041 --> 49:35.239
- with those eyes, right at my pussy.
- No, no... I did not.

49:35.240 --> 49:37.279
- You stared at my pussy!
- I did not stare at your pussy.

49:37.280 --> 49:38.000
Yes, you did!

49:38.001 --> 49:39.081
- Yes, you did!
- I did not.

49:39.440 --> 49:40.280
YOU STARED AT MY PUSSY!

49:40.280 --> 49:41.120
I DIDN'T STARE AT...

49:41.121 --> 49:42.520
STOP LYING!

49:49.600 --> 49:51.960
Be kind to those who deserve it.

49:53.640 --> 49:56.160
Be kind to those who deserve it.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.400
'What?

50:02.040 --> 50:05.120
'Yeah, but you said you were
meeting me in the city square.'

50:08.760 --> 50:10.960
So, Where are you now?!

50:13.040 --> 50:14.400
After-party!??

50:18.440 --> 50:19.680
What?

50:22.000 --> 50:24.240
Well, can't I just
meet you there?

50:25.520 --> 50:27.000
Hello!?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.839
'Sorry, baby! I know I'm late.

53:08.840 --> 53:11.000
'Fucking Odvard and his Minttu.'

53:11.400 --> 53:12.400
You asleep?

53:12.440 --> 53:13.760
Hey, babe?

53:14.800 --> 53:15.960
Sunshine?

53:28.880 --> 53:29.480
'Hey!

53:29.480 --> 53:30.480
'Wait!

53:30.760 --> 53:32.160
'Come back here!“

54:11.240 --> 54:14.640
You wanna check out my pussy?

54:15.520 --> 54:17.080
No!

54:37.120 --> 54:39.640
No.. no, no, no!

54:40.240 --> 54:42.880
'Where are you going?'

54:51.240 --> 54:52.759
No.

54:52.760 --> 54:54.319
No, please...

54:54.320 --> 54:57.640
'Here you go.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.880
'Yum, yum!'

55:05.120 --> 55:08.200
The blood is the life, Vidar!

55:08.840 --> 55:11.120
The blood is the life!

55:43.560 --> 55:48.999
"'It takes courage to stand up and
say: “Yes, I have a problem."

55:49.000 --> 55:54.960
'Yet, it requires divine strength
to keep this problem in check.

55:56.360 --> 56:00.199
'We have admitted to ourselves
that we suffer from addiction.

56:00.200 --> 56:03.440
'We are powerless over
The Devil's juice.'

56:04.240 --> 56:06.559
But we have made a choice.

56:06.560 --> 56:09.639
We chose to believe in something
greater than ourselves.

56:09.640 --> 56:12.560
A power than can help us
return to our senses.

56:14.080 --> 56:19.760
We have agreed to put our will and
our lives in the hands of the Lord.

56:22.280 --> 56:25.160
We have a new member
among us tonight.

56:27.400 --> 56:31.188
A lost soul who has
found the strength and

56:31.200 --> 56:35.000
courage to stand up and
proclaim his troubles.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.680
Would you care to share
your story with us?

56:40.680 --> 56:42.239
Do I have to stand up?

56:42.240 --> 56:44.520
Nope, you do as you please.

56:44.720 --> 56:46.239
Then I will remain seated.

56:46.240 --> 56:48.440
Yes, then you remain seated.
That's great.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.600
OK-

56:54.240 --> 56:55.679
Hi, I'm...

56:55.680 --> 56:57.479
My name is Vidar.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.960
Hi, Vidar!

57:03.120 --> 57:04.879
So...

57:04.880 --> 57:09.799
To be perfectly honest, I really
don't know what I'm doing here.

57:09.800 --> 57:12.799
I'm not technically
an alcoholic.

57:12.800 --> 57:14.079
But, uh...

57:14.080 --> 57:15.439
I drink...

57:15.440 --> 57:18.480
I mean, I drank...
a little too much.

57:19.760 --> 57:22.919
I've been sober...

57:22.920 --> 57:25.039
about a week now.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.199
That's great! That's
great, Vidar!

57:27.200 --> 57:28.519
There's no need for applause.

57:28.520 --> 57:29.679
This is how it starts.

57:29.680 --> 57:31.839
I'm gonna burst soon.

57:31.840 --> 57:34.159
No... you have to
be strong, Vidar.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.160
Be strong!

57:35.440 --> 57:37.800
Let Jesus take the wheel.

57:39.360 --> 57:41.440
Let Jesus take the wheel? - Yes.

57:42.280 --> 57:43.840
You know what?

57:44.160 --> 57:47.719
That is without a doubt the
biggest mistake of my life:

57:47.720 --> 57:50.119
Letting Jesus take the wheel.

57:50.120 --> 57:51.439
Trust me.

57:51.440 --> 57:53.439
I know the Savior on
a personal level.

57:53.440 --> 57:54.999
He's sitting right there!

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Right there.

57:56.880 --> 57:57.840
Hey hey!

57:57.841 --> 57:59.320
That guy.

58:00.760 --> 58:01.840
Yeah...

58:02.200 --> 58:03.879
Pay him no attention.

58:03.880 --> 58:05.239
This is not his story.

58:05.240 --> 58:07.839
Actually, it's about him too.

58:07.840 --> 58:09.879
My point is:

58:09.880 --> 58:12.320
Jesus is not the way
out of this mess.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.520
He is temptation itself.

58:15.800 --> 58:17.400
I'm truly starting to wonder.

58:18.120 --> 58:21.360
Are Jesus and Lucifer
one and the same?

58:22.800 --> 58:23.680
Huh?

58:23.680 --> 58:24.320
No-

58:24.321 --> 58:26.119
Just think about it!

58:26.120 --> 58:28.760
Both were cast out of heaven
by their father, right?

58:29.000 --> 58:29.720
Right.

58:29.721 --> 58:32.319
Both gathered huge
flocks of sheep, -

58:32.320 --> 58:34.639
- incapable of rational thought.

58:34.640 --> 58:37.320
Dependent on others to take
control, like you said.

58:37.520 --> 58:38.160
Yes?

58:38.161 --> 58:39.479
Yes!

58:39.480 --> 58:41.239
The Devil encourages us to sin.

58:41.240 --> 58:42.319
He does.

58:42.320 --> 58:44.400
Jesus fraternizes with whores!

58:45.400 --> 58:46.919
He turns water into
wine, god damnit!

58:46.920 --> 58:49.119
He's the biggest
alcoholic among us!

58:49.120 --> 58:50.040
Thank you, Vidar.

58:50.041 --> 58:51.559
No! No, listen!

58:51.560 --> 58:53.480
Thank you, Vidar!

58:54.000 --> 58:55.439
That was great.

58:55.440 --> 58:57.080
I drink blood.

58:57.720 --> 58:58.440
I drink blood.

58:58.441 --> 58:59.479
Yeah, that's great.

58:59.480 --> 59:00.320
I drink blood.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.320
That's great, Vidar.

59:01.560 --> 59:02.759
VIDAR!

59:02.760 --> 59:03.760
Shhh.

59:04.520 --> 59:05.640
Right.

59:06.760 --> 59:10.080
Anyone else care to share?

59:15.000 --> 59:17.720
'No matter what I do, I
always fall off the wagon.

59:18.880 --> 59:23.040
'The longer I refrain from drinking,
the more I lose my mind.'

59:24.200 --> 59:26.720
I can't control myself.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.320
I turn into a monster.

59:40.000 --> 59:44.640
What if I could wake this morn'

59:45.320 --> 59:49.880
Without feeling sad and blue

59:50.560 --> 59:55.280
<i>n</i> In a healthy body born

59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.640
<i>n</i> One that functions
without you.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:03.879
Oh, how nice

01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.320
<i>41 Oh, What fun 41.</i>

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.960
Oh, the things I would've done.

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:16.440
<i>B</i> What if I could hit the town.

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.880
Talked to folks 'bout
this and that <i>J.</i>

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:27.320
A faithful steward to His crown.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.640
Laid to rest my sinful past.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.560
Oh, how nice

01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.160
<i>41 Oh, What fun 41.</i>

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:42.720
Oh, the things I would've done.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:58.800
Guess I'll have to settle down

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.320
<i>n</i> I am who I am at best.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.560
Give it time and it will grow

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:14.640
<i>n</i> I hope that I'm
myself no less.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.999
Oh, how nice

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.679
<i>41 Oh, What fun 41.</i>

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:24.800
Oh, the things I would've done.

01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:30.760
Just to be normal.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.000
Vidar?

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.000
Is that you?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.040
Damn right, that's you.

01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.960
I didn't recognize you
with that insane mustache.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.359
I seriously thought
you were dead.

01:01:52.360 --> 01:01:53.120
Nahh...

01:01:53.121 --> 01:01:56.440
You about to do some drilling
in the 'meat tunnel'?

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:58.640
I only eat meat.

01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:00.799
You and I both, Vidar.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.840
Come join me for a beer.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.199
We can reminisce about
the good old days.

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.359
The whore needs a
break anyway, Vidar.

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:09.720
I fucked her so hard the
walls were shaking.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.879
She started crying, Vidar.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.159
Tears of joy.

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.160
Tears of pure joy.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.719
Could it be that this
uncontrollable desire...

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.399
- this obsessive hunt for
short-lived happiness...

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:31.400
is your way of eluding
your true problems?

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:34.680
Wait, I'm not following?

01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:38.428
Addiction can be someone's
attempt to avoid

01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:41.160
an emotional problem by
removing the emotion.

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.800
Thus, avoiding to deal with
the underlying problem.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:49.960
Which is?

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:54.679
Let me give you an example:

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.640
Humans eat in order
to survive, right?

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.280
Sure.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:02.599
But if you eat lots of chocolate
because you're feeling sad, -

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.159
- or because you're bored...

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.508
- you're essentially
fooling the part of the

01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.880
brain that provides the
sensation of happiness.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.199
However, the moment this
feeling subsides...

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.719
the sadness returns.

01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:19.720
You'll never rid yourself
of your problems this way.

01:03:23.600 --> 01:03:25.319
So, What you're saying is...

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.559
The reason I'm out drinking
every night is because...

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.720
deep inside, I'm feeling sad?

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.000
Vidar, may I be blunt with you?

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:43.919
I think your problem
exclusively concerns...

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:46.600
young, tight pussy, Vidar!

01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:48.519
Pattaya, Vidar.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.320
Pattaya.

01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:50.839
Oh my God, Pattaya.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.239
If you've never been, you need to get
your ass on the very first flight.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.520
You will drown in pussy, Vidar.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.319
But those days are gone.

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:08.399
Nowadays my ass is
stuck at home, -

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:13.400
- with four shitty kids and a wife
that barely touches me anymore.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.039
What about you, Vidar?

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:18.720
Are you married?

01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.319
That's What I thought.

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.160
You will never get a
girlfriend, Vidar.

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.720
You will never get a girlfriend.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:48.039
When he comes at you with his left
hook, you turn the other cheek?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.079
Who the fuck taught you that?!

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.319
You have to strike
back, god damnit!

01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:53.679
You thirst for vengeance!

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.919
You thirst for blood!

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:56.719
You're an animal,
Vidar, you hear me?

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.519
You're a fucking beast!

01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.560
Here you go!

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:05.960
Now get your shit together, and
beat the crap outta that brat!

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:44.160
'Use your teeth!'

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.880
Use your teeth!!

01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.160
USE YOUR TEETH!

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.800
'There's no arguing, that
dickhead deserved to die.'

01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:32.520
I deserve to die.

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.639
For real this time!

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:36.719
Without being resurrected,
and resurrected, -

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.708
- and resurrected,
and resurrected, and

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.720
ressurected, and resurrected,
and resurrected!

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.960
What's the point of
living like this?

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:47.520
Huh?

01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:50.359
I devour anything in my path.

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.719
It's pure gluttony.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.439
MnyeethyeehMNYEEH!

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.600
A fucking mess!

01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.639
I only think of myself
and that's your fault!

01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.600
My fault?!

01:06:58.601 --> 01:07:00.399
Yes, your fault.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.079
You're a terrible role model.

01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:03.399
Terrible!

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:05.000
You bring out the worst in me.

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.319
You make me commit all
sorts of horrible acts, -

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.919
- without considering
the consequences.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:14.279
With no concern for those
touched by these acts.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:15.599
Quite literally:

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:18.039
The ones I'm molesting!

01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.919
I can't take this anymore!

01:07:19.920 --> 01:07:22.759
I'm tearing apart my
soul, piece by piece.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.079
I've given you
everything you wanted...

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.560
and still you're whining?!

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.999
Yeah, yeah, thank you!

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.040
Thank you very much!

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.960
This isn't exactly
what I envisioned.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.440
Then, What did you envision?

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:40.799
The fuck if I know?!

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:42.720
Anything but this?!

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.200
I think we need to take a break.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.239
Then we take a break.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:59.159
I'll sleep in the car, and we'll
talk once you've calmed down.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.799
I'll make us breakfast
tomorrow and...

01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:02.119
No! No, no...

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:02.600
YES!

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.600
No, I'm talking about
a longer break.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.720
How long?

01:08:05.721 --> 01:08:07.239
I have no idea, -

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.719
- but if life truly is eternal,
it should be really fucking long.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.800
Use your fucking head!

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.519
You'll never manage without me!

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.640
NEVER”

01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:22.640
I don't believe you.

01:08:23.319 --> 01:08:24.960
You did not just say that??

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:27.720
Are you disowning me?

01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.040
What?

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:34.038
You said you don't believe in me.
Are you disowning me?

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:35.919
I don't know this man.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.479
I don't know him!

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.078
Why should I believe in you?

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.719
How can you say such a thing?

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:42.319
You've known me all your life.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.279
I thought I knew you.

01:08:44.279 --> 01:08:45.679
I did.

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.640
I thought you were a nice guy!?

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:52.479
How could I be so wrong?

01:08:52.479 --> 01:08:55.720
How the fuck could
I be so wrong?!

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.880
I'm no longer your companion.

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.359
I don't want your dirty money.

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:23.679
'Freely you have received, and
freely you will give it away.'

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:26.359
What the fuck does that mean?!

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:29.279
You and your hopeless parables!

01:09:29.279 --> 01:09:30.759
Fucking unintelligible!

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.879
Ok, now I'm completely lost.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:34.479
Where did Jesus go?

01:09:34.479 --> 01:09:36.439
You ask me, I ask you.

01:09:38.439 --> 01:09:40.080
I don't talk to him anymore.

01:09:42.399 --> 01:09:45.000
Now, that's an unexpected
step in the right direction.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.799
So you don't hear voices anymore?
No one is telling you what to do?

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:52.160
Not a single soul.

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.240
I'm all alone now.

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.800
That's fantastic.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.759
Hello.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.200
Hi.

01:11:19.201 --> 01:11:20.399
You wanna buy?

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.679
Flower?

01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:23.519
No, thank you.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.880
Please.

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:27.760
Girlfriend. Please?

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.760
I don't have a girlfriend.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:32.640
Please?

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.960
I don't want a flower.

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.759
- Who the fuck am I gonna give a flower to?
- Beautiful flower... please.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.039
I don't have a girlfriend
to give any flowers.

01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.000
What the fuck am I
to do with a flower?

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.239
Please. - Please, move along.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.799
I don't need any flowers.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:47.640
I don't want any flowers.

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.440
No flower.

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.560
No flower!

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.399
Hey, wait a second!

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:06.800
Wait!

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.359
Let me guess:

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:20.039
The Lord sent you?

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.440
No, not this time.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.120
I brought a flower.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.160
Thanks?

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.280
What are you up to?

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.760
I'm working.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:42.160
F course.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.360
Want to hang out instead?

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.839
Hang out?

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.040
Yes, do something else.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.639
Not unless you pay for it.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:56.719
I have lots of cash.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:12:57.640
Lots.

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.640
Look!

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.039
I can pay for everything.

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:02.799
Absolutely everything.

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.159
As long as you
pretend to like me.

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:09.399
Pretend to enjoy
yourself, at least.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:11.000
Pretend it's real.

01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:15.759
Very well. Fine.

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:19.000
Come in. I just need
to get dressed.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.680
Eirin, good night, Eirin.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.120
Eirin, good night.

01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:05.040
Good night, Eirin

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:10.320
I'll see you in my dreams.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:16.760
Last Saturday night
I got married.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.520
Me and my wife settled down.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:29.480
Now me and my wife are parted.

01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:35.240
I think I'll go out
on the town <i>3.</i>

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:43.400
Eirin, good night, Eirin.

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:48.600
Eirin, good night.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:55.960
Good night, Eirin

01:14:56.440 --> 01:15:01.360
I'll see you in my dreams

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:09.040
<i>n</i> I love Eirin, God knows I do

01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.360
I'll love her 'til
the seas run dry.

01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.200
But if Eirin should turn me down

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:27.440
I'd take morphine and die.

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:35.440
Eirin, good night, Eirin.

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:41.000
Eirin, good night.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:48.680
Good night, Eirin

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:54.560
I'll see you in my dreams.

01:15:56.840 --> 01:16:02.720
Eirin, good night, Eirin.

01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:07.680
Eirin, good night.

01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:14.480
Good night, Eirin

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:21.640
I'll see you in my dreams.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:27.599
A part of me really wants
to kiss you right now.

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:28.919
That's not possible.

01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.160
Why not?

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:33.360
Your time is up.

01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:35.119
No. No, no, no, no!

01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:36.599
Give me another ten minutes.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:37.799
Just ten minutes!

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.320
Oh, Vidar, we're already
ten minutes past.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:47.879
But you haven't helped me yet.

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.840
We've only been chatting.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:53.799
You take 1.200 Kroner an hour
just to Sit here and Chat?!

01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:57.520
Vidar, I understand that this
might sound unreasonable, -

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.759
- but I have an agreement
with health services, -

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.128
- and if you can acquire
a doctor's referral,

01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:05.519
you'll only have to
pay your deductible.

01:17:05.520 --> 01:17:08.480
However, you should be aware, the
wait might take six months...

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.480
- and I would recommend a
new session next week.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640
I bet you would.

01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.919
For 1.200 Kroner an hour I might
as well solicit a prostitute.

01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:20.879
Get more bang for my buck.

01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:22.719
Vidar, that's enough.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.159
You can't expect to get well
after one single session.

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:28.039
I can't flick a magic
wand in the air and say:

01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:31.479
Take your weird garments and your
sunglasses, go outside, enjoy life, -

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.200
- you're fit a as fiddle.
This is not how this works.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.439
This is a process.

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:41.759
We've only started scratching the
surface, and quite frankly, -

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.079
- I think we should keep scratching
until we reach the bottom...

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.039
and then we unravel the knots.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.720
How does that sound?

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.439
Ehh, I... I'm thinking...

01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.159
Vidar, I...

01:17:56.160 --> 01:17:57.999
Sorry, but we have to finish up.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.560
I have another client waiting,
and you can't be here right now.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.560
You understand.

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:07.439
So, what I'll do is:

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.440
I'll put you down for
a new session next...

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.799
Thursday.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:14.919
Same time.

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:19.439
Until then, I suggest you continue
your twelve-step program.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.799
Sound good?

01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.319
Good, Vidar. Until next time.

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:25.120
Have a safe journey home.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.960
Mmh.

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:05.520
<i>41 Oh, hem me God 41</i>
