Oh, I've wanted to do that
ever since fifth grade...

00:37.121 --> 00:38.996
when you made fun of me
for getting pubes.

00:39.081 --> 00:43.042
Now that you've joined Lullaby
Lee's and insperminated the
queen of the Chastity Ball...

00:43.127 --> 00:45.378
and dropped below us

- We need to talk.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.199
Okay.

01:15.284 --> 01:19.036
As you know, even though
she refuses to wear the ring
and won't tell anyone—

01:19.121 --> 01:21.998
including her mother-
about the engagement, Emma and I
are, in fact, getting married.

01:22.082 --> 01:25.877
Yes. Ken convinced me we need
to at least be in the same room
when the marriage is certified.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.754
What can I say?
I'm a traditionalist.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.381
We're going to Hawaii
and getting married
on the beach.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.093
And you want me to come?

01:34.178 --> 01:37.638
No, no, no, no. I picked Hawaii,
because it's far away
from everybody we know.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.349
- Oh.
- Uh, the thing is,

01:40.434 --> 01:43.561
is that after a very brief,
private ceremony,

01:43.645 --> 01:45.855
Ken has decided he would
like to have a first dance.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.357
The problem is,
we can't decide on the song.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.818
Yes. I would like to have
"I Could've Danced All Night."

01:50.903 --> 01:53.112
Oh, from My Fair Lady.

01:53.197 --> 01:55.573
Great choice.
Such a romantic song.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.784
Yes.
[Chuckles]

01:57.868 --> 02:00.578
Yeah, if you’re
making a mixed tape
for the boring parade.

02:00.662 --> 02:04.415
I want the "Thong Song."

02:04.500 --> 02:07.418
I need something I can
shake my moneymaker to.

02:07.503 --> 02:09.378
Um-

02:09.463 --> 02:14.008
Uh, I was remembering, um,
that you did those, uh,

02:14.134 --> 02:16.135
mash-up things
with the Glee kids, right?
Uh-huh.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.806
So I thought maybe
you could find a way
to use both of our songs.

02:19.890 --> 02:23.017
Um, and I- well, we...

02:23.101 --> 02:25.770
both need— want—
need dance lessons.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.523
Yeah, I-I—
I mean, I might need
a bit of polishing,

02:28.607 --> 02:30.399
but it's the Emster here
you really have to work with.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.860
Had a monster case
of athlete's foot
a couple years back.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.862
Had to get all
my toenails removed.

02:34.947 --> 02:38.533
So if she steps on my feet
during the dance,
I might pass out.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.452
We would, uh, be very happy
to pay you for your time, Will.

02:41.537 --> 02:45.248
No. No, I want to
give you these lessons
as a wedding gift.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.001

02:49.127 --> 02:50.503
Hmm!
Great.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.630
[School Bell Rings]
This is a disaster.

02:52.714 --> 02:56.634
Our reputation as
McKinley High's "it" couple
is in serious jeopardy...

02:56.718 --> 03:00.263
if we don't find some way
to be cool again, Finn.

03:00.389 --> 03:04.183
The Slushee war has commenced.
And if Finn and Quinn got
nailed, none of us are safe.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.894
Okay, guys.
We're a little behind
for sectionals,

03:06.979 --> 03:09.564
thanks to our
Sue Sylvester detour.

03:09.648 --> 03:11.941
But you guys seem to really
enjoy doing mash-ups, right?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.609
And I'm gonna keep
you guys fired up.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.863
Plus, there's
an important lesson
to be learned with mash-ups.

03:16.947 --> 03:19.365
Sometimes things are so
different, they don't feel
like they go together.

03:19.449 --> 03:22.994
But the big difference
between them
is what makes them great.

03:23.078 --> 03:26.163
Like... chocolate and bacon.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.957
Or Glee Club
and football.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.544
Exactly. But you've proven
that it is a great combination.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.047

my personal favorite song.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.971
And your homework for the week
is to find an unexpected mash-up
to go with it.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.892
"Bust a Move"?
Yeah, this song
is old school.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.060
All right.
Um, Artie.
Yeah?

Where you can play football
and sing and dance and no one
gets down on you for it.

37:46.681 --> 37:48.474
Where the more different
you are the better.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.941
I guess what
I'm tryin' to say is...

37:57.025 --> 38:00.027
I don't wanna have to choose
between them anymore.

38:01.696 --> 38:04.490
It's not cool.

38:09.746 --> 38:13.040
[Sighs]

38:15.835 --> 38:20.297
Hey, about that
Thursday practice.
It's, uh, canceled indefinitely.

38:20.382 --> 38:22.800
I got...
stuff I gotta do
that time.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.135
Laundry,
things like that.

38:25.220 --> 38:28.889
[Exhales]
Oh. Sweet.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.226
Finn.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.480
Tell Puckerman
and the other guys too,
will you?

38:36.564 --> 38:40.109
Sure.
Thanks, Coach.

- [School Bell Rings]
- [Sue]
Schuester!

38:45.198 --> 38:48.492
Yeah.
I'll need to see that set list
for sectionals after all.

38:48.576 --> 38:51.620
I want it on my desk warm
from the laminator at 5:00 p.m.

38:51.705 --> 38:56.000
And if it is one minute late,
I will go to the animal shelter
and get you a kitty cat.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.460
I will let you fall in love
with that kitty cat.

38:58.545 --> 39:02.339
And then on some dark,
cold night I will steal a way
into your home...

39:02.424 --> 39:04.717
and punch you in the face.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.179
- Hey, Sue.
- What?

39:09.264 --> 39:11.390
- Didn't work out with Rod?
- No, it did not.

39:12.434 --> 39:14.685
Q, take off
those sunglasses.

39:14.769 --> 39:18.355
I wanna look in your eyes
when I give you
this piece of business.

39:18.440 --> 39:21.859
You're off the Cheerios.
I can't have a pregnant girl
on my squad.

39:21.943 --> 39:24.278
You're a disgrace.

[School Bell Rings]

[Kids Chattering]
Hey.

39:40.295 --> 39:42.171
Hey.

39:44.174 --> 39:47.593
I wanted to talk to you
about your wedding mash-up.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.638
I've been workin'
really hard on it and...

39:53.975 --> 39:56.435
I just can't get
those two songs
to go together.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.812
Yeah. That's because
they don't.

40:00.982 --> 40:02.608
We both know that.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.944
[Sighs]

40:06.029 --> 40:08.614
They're both
good songs though.

40:10.366 --> 40:12.826
Great ones.

40:17.457 --> 40:20.667
Will, um,
I just wanted to say, uh-

40:22.420 --> 40:24.922
Thank you...

40:25.006 --> 40:26.965
for the dance lessons.

40:34.015 --> 40:38.435
[Footsteps Fade]

40:41.481 --> 40:45.317
So, what do you think about
my welcome back gift
to the club, huh, guys?

40:46.694 --> 40:48.862
Thanks for the Slushees, Finn.
They're delicious.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.990
[Kurt] And loaded with
empty calories. You know
why they call them Slushees?

40:52.075 --> 40:53.909
Because your butt looks like one
if you have too many of them.

40:53.993 --> 40:57.704
I'd like to propose a toast.
To Mr. Schue.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.124
You were right about
Glee Club and football
bein' a killer combination.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.168
[Cheering]

41:05.088 --> 41:08.048
Mr. Schue,
I am sorry to report...

41:08.133 --> 41:10.968
that we've all been remiss
about completing
our assignment this week.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.263
Yeah, none of us could
find a good groove
for "Bust a Move."

41:14.347 --> 41:16.265
And I personally feel
like a failure.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.685
Well, that's okay, guys.
Because I feel like
the lesson landed.

41:19.769 --> 41:21.645
And that's
what's important.

41:21.729 --> 41:26.859
And we are glad
to have you back, Finn.
[Club Agrees]

41:26.943 --> 41:30.654
- You okay, Quinn?
- Do I look okay?

41:30.738 --> 41:35.993
I'm devastated. Now that
I'm off the Cheerios, I'll start
every day with a Slushee facial.

41:36.077 --> 41:40.080
That's okay if that happens,
Quinn, because there are
11 of your friends right here...

41:40.165 --> 41:43.333
- who are gonna be more than
happy to help clean you off.
- [All] Yeah. Whoo!

41:43.418 --> 41:45.043
That's right, girl.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.590
[Groans]
Mmm, brain freeze.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.261
I can't imagine gettin'
hit in the kisser
with one of these.

41:55.930 --> 41:58.557
You've never been hit
by a Slushee before, Mr. Schue?

41:58.641 --> 42:00.225
Um-

42:03.396 --> 42:04.396
All right, guys.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.107
[Sighs]
We're a team.

42:08.693 --> 42:10.527
Bring it on.
Gimme your best shot.

42:10.612 --> 42:15.782
- One, two, three.
- [Screams]

42:17.952 --> 42:23.415
Oh. [Sighs]
All right.
