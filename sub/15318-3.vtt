07:50.941 --> 07:52.308
Any longer than that,

I'm guessing
local response time

08:39.456 --> 08:41.457
For a town this size
is five minutes max.

08:41.457 --> 08:43.759
We'll never be able to
isolate the host in that time.

can rob the bank.

Clearly you're a smart woman.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.478

on a personal level,

10:42.479 --> 10:43.779
And then maybe...

10:43.780 --> 10:47.082
They won't kill you.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.784
You can't blame a guy
for trying, right?

10:50.420 --> 10:51.787
No,

10:51.788 --> 10:53.522
But if you don't sit down
and stay quiet,

10:53.523 --> 10:55.791
I will blow
your head off.

How could something
so beautiful

11:07.737 --> 11:09.972
Contain something so butt ugly?

11:09.973 --> 11:11.507
<i>This isn't
a beauty contest, henry.</i>

11:11.508 --> 11:12.741
<i>Did you find it?</i>

11:12.742 --> 11:16.045
Yeah, uh... Acetylcho...

11:16.046 --> 11:19.448
Acetylcholinesterase.

11:19.449 --> 11:20.916
Yeah, took the word
right outta my mouth.

11:20.917 --> 11:21.917
<i>It's an enzyme
inhibitor.</i>

11:21.918 --> 11:23.552
Like a natural valium.

11:23.553 --> 11:25.621
Oh, good, so it's
ugly and relaxed.

11:25.622 --> 11:26.655
In the wild,

11:26.656 --> 11:27.923
The ferropodous secretes
the inhibitor

11:27.924 --> 11:29.458
To sedate its host.

11:29.459 --> 11:32.695
So our human time bomb should
be asleep by now then, right?

11:32.696 --> 11:35.130
<i>No, the, human metabolism
is significantly stronger.</i>

11:35.131 --> 11:37.633
The average person
wouldn't feel any effect,

11:37.634 --> 11:39.802
Except perhaps in the peripheral
synaptic mechanisms.

11:39.803 --> 11:41.070
Such as?

11:41.071 --> 11:42.137
<i>It would slow down</i>

11:42.138 --> 11:44.473
The photoreceptors in the eyes.

11:44.474 --> 11:46.976
There should be a perceptible
lag in reaction time

11:46.977 --> 11:48.077
In the rods and cones.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.246
I already know
your next question.

11:50.247 --> 11:52.615
And I think
I already know your answer.

11:52.616 --> 11:54.617
Why would I bring
a retinal scanner

11:54.618 --> 11:56.852
<i>To a simple
bug pick-up?</i>

12:01.024 --> 12:02.892
You were right.

12:02.893 --> 12:05.728
This video footage
is just about useless.

12:05.729 --> 12:08.030
I can barely recognize us,

12:08.031 --> 12:09.999
Let alone
spot a tiny ferropodous

12:10.000 --> 12:11.967
Slithering across
the floor.

12:11.968 --> 12:14.737
Well, it was a shot.

12:16.106 --> 12:17.907
I need to send you two
on a scavenger hunt.

12:17.908 --> 12:19.575
I love a good
scavenger hunt.

12:19.576 --> 12:21.577
By the way, this
surveillance video is--pfft.

12:21.578 --> 12:23.512
Look, I don't get it.

12:23.513 --> 12:24.947
Wouldn't somebody
have felt this thing?

12:24.948 --> 12:26.549
The temperature of
a newly hatched embryo

12:26.550 --> 12:27.917
Is 98.2 degrees.

12:27.918 --> 12:29.785
So close to human
body temperature,

12:29.786 --> 12:31.520
You'd never even feel it
on your skin.

12:31.521 --> 12:32.855
Allowing it
to slip easily

12:32.856 --> 12:34.256
Into its...
Orifice of choice.

12:35.825 --> 12:38.594
Until its gestation
is fully complete,

12:38.595 --> 12:40.195
There are virtually
no outward symptoms.

12:40.196 --> 12:42.264
Okay, so,

12:42.265 --> 12:44.033
What are we
scavenging for?

12:55.178 --> 12:57.079
I'm not feeling so good.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.914
Have a seat.

12:58.915 --> 13:00.749
Dear god, it can't
be happening already.

13:00.750 --> 13:01.850
She's burning up.

13:01.851 --> 13:03.619

13:03.620 --> 13:05.321
If we can
get her out before--

If bridget
is indeed the host,

13:53.803 --> 13:55.304

13:55.305 --> 13:57.406
Are more innocent people

<i>I understand we got a bit
of a situation here.</i>

14:10.153 --> 14:12.554
Yeah, I'd say so.
Seven hostages.

14:12.555 --> 14:14.456
No injuries.

14:14.457 --> 14:16.058
If you'd like
to keep it that way,

14:16.059 --> 14:17.559

eddie izzard show.

14:24.767 --> 14:26.401

keep 'em busy for a while.

14:29.706 --> 14:30.706
Is she kidding me?

14:36.913 --> 14:39.081
She may be
running a fever.

14:39.082 --> 14:41.450
I thought there weren't
supposed to be any symptoms.

14:41.451 --> 14:43.552
Well, not until
it's ready to emerge.

14:43.553 --> 14:44.786
But this is too soon.

14:44.787 --> 14:46.121
I would've thought so,

14:46.122 --> 14:47.689
But given her
condition at present...

14:47.690 --> 14:48.790
So basically,
we're screwed.

14:48.791 --> 14:49.825
She's going to explode,

14:49.826 --> 14:50.893
And the ferropodous
is going to take out

14:50.894 --> 14:52.494
Everybody in the bank?

14:52.495 --> 14:53.862

14:58.167 --> 15:00.135
I've operated
in the trenches at verdun.

15:00.136 --> 15:01.570
At least here I don't have
to deal with the mud

15:01.571 --> 15:02.971
And the rats.

15:02.972 --> 15:04.640
Well, when you put it
like that...

15:04.641 --> 15:08.577
Before we risk her life,
I need to be absolutely certain.

She's obviously crazy,
just my type.

Uh, magnus

15:42.245 --> 15:44.046
A retinal scanner.

15:44.047 --> 15:45.781
With the backwards
security in this joint?

15:45.782 --> 15:47.149
Well, all we need to do
is find something

15:47.150 --> 15:49.184
That captures and transmits
reflected light.

15:49.185 --> 15:50.852
Henry will walk us
through the rest.

15:50.853 --> 15:51.687
All right.

It's for you.

15:57.593 --> 15:58.660
Yeah.

15:58.661 --> 16:00.095
Just wanted to let you know

16:00.096 --> 16:02.597
The helicopter you requested,
it's on its way.

[scoffs]

16:03.633 --> 16:05.133
Really?

16:05.134 --> 16:07.302
So, you called your captain,

16:07.303 --> 16:09.738
He relayed the request
to the fbi,

16:09.739 --> 16:11.039
Who then contacted
homeland security,

16:11.040 --> 16:12.674
Who in turn
cleared a flight path

16:12.675 --> 16:14.076
With the f.A.A.,

16:14.077 --> 16:15.277

It frightens me
that we're co-workers.

16:26.556 --> 16:30.125
Good. So, I emailed a copy
of these blueprints to hank.

16:30.126 --> 16:31.626
Why?

16:31.627 --> 16:34.096
Because in 1984, the bank
added a new restroom,

16:34.097 --> 16:38.633
And in 2002 the municipal
sewer system laid a new pipe

16:38.634 --> 16:40.235
Right along the east side
of the building.

16:40.236 --> 16:41.603
Brilliant.

16:41.604 --> 16:43.205
So we're going to escape
through the toilets?

16:43.206 --> 16:45.907
Possibly.

16:48.077 --> 16:49.845
Sweating, nausea, dizziness,

But that could mean
several different things.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.048
Well, here's hoping.

16:53.049 --> 16:56.685
I can't help the feeling
that there's something off.

16:56.686 --> 16:57.919

her vital signs.

Except for, uh,
a stapler,

A laser printer,
an adding machine...

17:11.901 --> 17:15.904
Oh, and stacks
and stacks of cash.

There was a time when
that would've been enough.

17:23.746 --> 17:26.080

With a little tweaking,

17:28.217 --> 17:30.318
<i>And a smartphone with
an unlimited data plan.</i>

17:34.257 --> 17:36.291
You know,
if this doesn't work...

17:36.292 --> 17:39.594
Well, I can only stall
the local cops for so long.

17:39.595 --> 17:41.863
The feds have
even less patience.

17:41.864 --> 17:43.198
Hey, I think I found one
that'll work.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.040
<i>[will]: How?</i>

20:39.041 --> 20:40.842
A toxin,

20:40.843 --> 20:42.477
Not potent enough
to harm a human,

20:42.478 --> 20:44.145
But strong enough
to force the ferropodous

20:44.146 --> 20:45.113
To vacate its host.

20:45.114 --> 20:46.581
Is that wise?

20:46.582 --> 20:49.884
Well, if we can get it out
before it hatches on its own,

20:49.885 --> 20:51.086
The host could
survive.

20:51.087 --> 20:52.988
<i>Yeah, that sounds
reasonable, but...</i>

20:52.989 --> 20:54.823
Oh, wait. Me?

20:54.824 --> 20:56.057
You can do this.

20:56.058 --> 20:57.292
<i>[henry]: No.</i>

20:57.293 --> 20:59.027
No, no, no, I'm the geek.
You're the doc.

20:59.028 --> 21:00.795
I do tech, you do drugs.

21:02.031 --> 21:03.365
You know what I mean.

21:03.366 --> 21:04.499
No time to argue.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.533
I'll talk you through
the procedure.

21:05.534 --> 21:07.836
<i>Supposing he can
whip something up,</i>

21:07.837 --> 21:09.304
How is he going
to get it to you?

21:09.305 --> 21:11.239
First things first.

21:11.240 --> 21:12.874
Go to my medical cabinet,

21:12.875 --> 21:15.944
<i>Follow my instructions
precisely.</i>

21:15.945 --> 21:17.512
<i>Start with the triptophase.</i>

21:17.513 --> 21:21.049
Triptophase, okay.
Got it.

21:21.050 --> 21:22.517
Right, using
the pipette,

21:22.518 --> 21:24.853
Extract exactly
two milliliters.

21:33.195 --> 21:35.997
That's
close enough.

21:35.998 --> 21:37.165
The old lady, grace.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.433
She's really cold.

21:38.434 --> 21:40.935
Said something
about her heart.

21:40.936 --> 21:42.337
Can't you at least let her go?

21:42.338 --> 21:44.539
Can't do that.

21:47.209 --> 21:48.810
It's funny, you know,

21:48.811 --> 21:51.079
The first time I saw you,
I thought you were beautiful.

21:51.080 --> 21:52.614
Sit back down.

22:05.328 --> 22:08.396
Okay, done. Now what?

22:08.397 --> 22:10.365
You don't have a microfilter,

22:10.366 --> 22:12.967
But a centrifuge should be able
to separate the particles.

22:15.037 --> 22:16.004
Three minutes.

22:17.006 --> 22:18.306
Okay.

22:19.975 --> 22:21.576
Now that
bridget's clear,

22:21.577 --> 22:23.878
I think she'd be safer
on the outside.

22:23.879 --> 22:25.347
She may be, but right now,
they're blind.

22:25.348 --> 22:27.949
We release a hostage,
we lose that advantage.

22:27.950 --> 22:29.184
They'll know
our numbers,

22:29.185 --> 22:31.086
And our less-than-bloodthirsty
attitude.

22:31.087 --> 22:35.523
I know, but if I can save
another life today, I will.

22:35.524 --> 22:37.025
Make the call.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.630
You, come with me.

22:54.210 --> 22:56.177
[telephone rings]

22:56.178 --> 22:58.380
This is special agent
bruce tanner, fbi.

22:58.381 --> 23:01.182
You made good time
from seattle.

23:01.183 --> 23:03.184
Who am I speaking with?

23:03.185 --> 23:05.887
Someone about to release
a hostage.

23:05.888 --> 23:08.323
She's coming out now.
Let's make this smooth.

23:09.992 --> 23:11.993
Two, three...

23:14.964 --> 23:16.231
No, no, no, no!

23:17.400 --> 23:18.333
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:20.102 --> 23:21.069
Go! Take it!

23:21.070 --> 23:22.303
[shot blasts,
people scream]

23:25.074 --> 23:27.609
Cease fire!
Hold your fire!

23:27.610 --> 23:29.077
Steady. Steady.

23:32.548 --> 23:33.515
Are you hit?

23:33.516 --> 23:34.449
Is everyone all right?

23:34.450 --> 23:35.550
I'm good.

23:35.551 --> 23:36.584
I'm okay.

23:36.585 --> 23:37.685
No.

23:41.504 --> 23:43.405
Take it easy.
No sudden moves.

23:43.406 --> 23:44.439
[wincing in pain]

23:44.440 --> 23:45.574
There.

23:45.575 --> 23:47.209
That should
slow down the bleeding.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.643
Hold it tight.

23:48.644 --> 23:50.245
Relax, you're going
to be all right.

23:50.246 --> 23:54.015
I'll be right back, okay?

23:55.551 --> 23:56.985
Just hang in there,
you're going to be fine.

23:56.986 --> 23:58.053
Okay, look right here.

23:58.054 --> 23:59.721
What's that for?

23:59.722 --> 24:02.491
Well, you wouldn't believe it
if I told you.

24:02.492 --> 24:03.992
[scanner warbling]

24:03.993 --> 24:05.727
So bridget's release,

24:05.728 --> 24:07.562
It probably bought us
a few minutes,

24:07.563 --> 24:08.630
But you know

24:08.631 --> 24:10.265
We're going to
lose hank.

24:10.266 --> 24:11.600
They're going to find out
we're on our cell phones.

24:11.601 --> 24:13.335
They'll either jam us
or trace hank,

24:13.336 --> 24:15.704
And once they cut off the power,
which they will,

24:15.705 --> 24:17.339
We're going to be cut off
from all communication.

24:17.340 --> 24:20.442
Then we need to scan
the other hostages right away.

24:20.443 --> 24:21.376
Get the data to henry.

24:21.377 --> 24:23.111
All right, and what about..?

24:23.112 --> 24:24.346
I can't release him

24:24.347 --> 24:25.480
Until his scan
results are back.

24:25.481 --> 24:27.315
Yeah, but we can't just
let him bleed to death.

24:27.316 --> 24:29.084
I don't intend to.

24:29.085 --> 24:31.086
Find me a first aid kit
and some instant glue.

24:31.087 --> 24:32.521
Okay.

24:32.522 --> 24:34.623
All right,
it's coming through now.

24:34.624 --> 24:35.657
<i>How long?</i>

24:35.658 --> 24:37.659
Asap.

24:37.660 --> 24:38.860
<i>Sooner's better.</i>

24:38.861 --> 24:39.794
You guys are a real
broken record today,

24:39.795 --> 24:40.662
You know that?

24:41.797 --> 24:43.365
How many weapons
do they have?

24:43.366 --> 24:46.134
Um, three guns, I think.

24:46.135 --> 24:48.270
Semi-automatics?

24:49.472 --> 24:51.706
Did they look like that?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.441
Yes, I think so.

24:53.442 --> 24:55.443
Is there anything else
that you can think of?

24:55.444 --> 24:57.412
They seemed to be
talking to someone.

24:57.413 --> 24:58.547
On the phone,

24:58.548 --> 25:00.048
In their earpieces.

25:00.049 --> 25:01.516
Get a cell tracker going.

25:01.517 --> 25:02.751
They're talking to somebody
outside the bank.

25:02.752 --> 25:03.685
I want to know who.

25:05.021 --> 25:06.755
Let's start
a triangulation.

25:09.192 --> 25:11.426
[groans in pain]

25:11.427 --> 25:14.396
Found it, but really?

25:14.397 --> 25:15.630
It was
originally used

25:15.631 --> 25:17.265
To seal battle wounds
in the field.

25:17.266 --> 25:18.333
[cries out in pain]

25:18.334 --> 25:21.069
[gasping]

25:22.471 --> 25:25.040
Alcohol swab
and bandage tightly.

25:25.041 --> 25:27.742
I'll be right back.

25:29.645 --> 25:32.614
What's really going on here?

25:33.583 --> 25:35.584
[screams]

25:36.719 --> 25:38.787
Sorry.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.522
You guys are supposed
to be bank robbers,

25:40.523 --> 25:43.225
But you haven't even
stolen any money yet.

25:43.226 --> 25:45.760
Your buddy's taking pictures
of everyone's eyes

25:45.761 --> 25:47.362
With that scanner thing,

25:47.363 --> 25:48.697
And your ringleader just
plugged my arm wh glue.

25:48.698 --> 25:50.332
Who the hell are
you people anyway--

25:52.335 --> 25:53.768
[grumbles]

25:57.240 --> 26:00.141
I scanned the rest
of the hostages.

26:00.142 --> 26:01.543
Henry's going to call
with the results

26:01.544 --> 26:02.644
As he gets them.

26:02.645 --> 26:03.545
Any word from
our friends outside?

26:03.546 --> 26:04.980
No, they've gone quiet.

26:04.981 --> 26:08.383
They, however, may be
the least of our worries.

26:08.384 --> 26:12.754
I found this amongst
the hostages' cells.

26:12.755 --> 26:13.822
A tracker?

26:13.823 --> 26:15.123
Yeah.

26:15.124 --> 26:16.157
Interesting.
What's the target?

26:16.158 --> 26:20.395
I followed the signal.
It led me to this.

26:20.396 --> 26:22.664
I found it underneath
one of the chairs.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.835
A transport container
with a homing beacon.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.237
Which means someone else
in the bank

26:29.238 --> 26:31.172
Is after the ferropodous.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.307
How could anyone have known?

26:32.308 --> 26:33.508
It's not inconceivable.

26:33.509 --> 26:35.677
Thieves stole
the two ferropodous eggs

26:35.678 --> 26:36.978
Last month,

26:36.979 --> 26:38.680
Believing they were
rare works of art.

26:38.681 --> 26:41.116
They ended up for sale
at a private auction.

26:41.117 --> 26:42.484
Right, one went to monaco,

26:42.485 --> 26:43.818
The other was bought
by somebody we traced here.

26:43.819 --> 26:45.487
After the european disaster,

26:45.488 --> 26:46.821
It's possible that word
leaked out

26:46.822 --> 26:48.156
On the abnormal black market.

26:48.157 --> 26:51.426
So one of the hostages
is actually our competition.

26:51.427 --> 26:52.827
Do we know
whose cell phone it is?

26:52.828 --> 26:54.429
No.

26:54.430 --> 26:55.864
All right, let's keep our cards
face down for the moment.

26:55.865 --> 26:57.565
Yeah.

26:59.468 --> 27:00.735
You tryin' to kill us

27:00.736 --> 27:01.603
By freezing us to death?

27:01.604 --> 27:02.437
Hey!

27:02.438 --> 27:03.772
It's all right.

27:03.773 --> 27:04.673
I apologize
for the temperature.

27:04.674 --> 27:06.708
Please return
to your seat.

27:06.709 --> 27:10.245
If you're gonna rob the bank,
get on with it.

27:10.246 --> 27:11.746
Sir, just calm down

27:11.747 --> 27:12.614
And take a seat
with the others.

27:12.615 --> 27:14.215
I've been sitting

27:14.216 --> 27:16.651
On my butt waiting
for something to happen,

27:16.652 --> 27:19.220
But you guys just keep
dinking around.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.288
I'll bet you don't have
the guts to shoot me.

27:22.224 --> 27:24.426
What's to stop me
from walking out the front--

27:35.338 --> 27:36.671
[computer beeps]

27:36.672 --> 27:38.907
Hey, doc, the last scan
came back clear.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.842
Others are still processing.

27:40.843 --> 27:42.143
Thanks, henry.

27:42.144 --> 27:43.278
How's the chemical
cocktail coming?

27:43.279 --> 27:44.879
Yeah, it's almost done.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.182
Should have enough for one dose,
but that's about it.

27:47.183 --> 27:49.250
No margin for error, noted.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.485
<i>You know, it's not
like I can just</i>

of ferropodous toxin.

27:53.789 --> 27:55.790
<i>And the truck
and the winch?</i>

27:55.791 --> 27:57.392
What, the monster truck gag?
Kate was serious?

27:57.393 --> 27:58.893
Time, henry.

28:00.529 --> 28:01.496
I'm on it.

28:01.497 --> 28:02.731
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:05.267 --> 28:07.402
Temp normal.

28:07.403 --> 28:08.236
Good.

28:08.237 --> 28:09.804
I'll take over.

28:09.805 --> 28:12.207
There's been
an interesting development.

28:14.377 --> 28:16.211
You'll be happy to hear
you're free to go.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.516
Well, I'm not leaving
without grace.

28:21.517 --> 28:22.784
I'm sorry?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.452
She's looking really pale.

28:24.453 --> 28:25.887
I'm worried

28:25.888 --> 28:27.822
She's going to stroke
out or something.

28:28.924 --> 28:29.958
I'm offering you

28:29.959 --> 28:32.227
Your freedom.

28:32.228 --> 28:34.596
What difference does it make
which hostage gets to leave?

28:34.597 --> 28:36.798
Just send grace out.

28:36.799 --> 28:38.299
I'm not going
anywhere.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.335
You do seem
quite determined to stay.

28:40.336 --> 28:42.771
Yeah, what are you going to do,
you going to shoot me?

28:42.772 --> 28:44.739
You  ust saved my life.

28:44.740 --> 28:47.542
Show me your wallet.

28:55.484 --> 28:57.819
Out of state driver's license.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.954
I just moved to town.

28:59.955 --> 29:02.424
What do you do
for a living?

29:02.425 --> 29:05.660
I guess you could call me
an entrepreneur.

29:05.661 --> 29:08.530
With one, two,

29:08.531 --> 29:10.698
Three platinum cards.

29:10.699 --> 29:12.500
Wow, business must be good.

29:12.501 --> 29:15.437
Dad owns a lot of real estate.

29:15.438 --> 29:18.473
Why do I suddenly feel like
the criminal here?

29:27.316 --> 29:29.818
Smells like root beer.

29:29.819 --> 29:31.686
I hope that's a good thing.

29:31.687 --> 29:33.822
[tires squealing]

Aw, man!

29:43.332 --> 29:45.600
Bedtime, baby.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.404
This is the police.
We're entering the vehicle.

30:06.589 --> 30:07.889
Dammit!

30:09.692 --> 30:11.059
What kind of
time we got?

30:11.060 --> 30:13.027
Figuring magnus'
original calculations,

30:13.028 --> 30:14.996
10 minutes and counting?

30:14.997 --> 30:16.664
[cell phone vibrates]

30:18.033 --> 30:19.601
Oh, great.

30:19.602 --> 30:20.768
Henry's busted.

30:20.769 --> 30:22.570
Perfect.

30:22.571 --> 30:24.572
So we're on our own,

30:24.573 --> 30:25.607
And if my sense
of timing's right--

30:25.608 --> 30:28.443
There goes the power.

30:33.616 --> 30:35.450
Things are about to get ugly.

30:53.979 --> 30:56.180
It's already getting warmer
in here with the ac off.

30:56.181 --> 30:58.282
Not good for our potential host.

30:58.283 --> 30:59.383
Once they cut off
the power and the water,

30:59.384 --> 31:00.852
They'll make one more
attempt at negotiation

31:00.853 --> 31:02.620
Before they break off
all contact.

31:02.621 --> 31:04.255
Do you think
they'll take the offensive?

31:04.256 --> 31:05.623
Well, it's standard
protocol.

31:05.624 --> 31:07.458
They're not going to wait around
and starve us out.

31:07.459 --> 31:08.559
If we don't make a move soon,

31:08.560 --> 31:10.228
They will.

31:10.229 --> 31:12.530
But without
henry's scan results,

31:12.531 --> 31:14.098
We've no idea
who the ticking time bomb is.

31:18.937 --> 31:20.872
Their computers
are still running.

31:20.873 --> 31:24.609
Copy that.
Give me a tech team now.

31:24.610 --> 31:26.344
Aw, come on!

31:26.345 --> 31:28.579
God, I hate roaming.

31:30.149 --> 31:32.250
Hey!

31:34.920 --> 31:37.188
What are you writing?

31:37.189 --> 31:38.556
Uh, nothing.

31:38.557 --> 31:40.625
Hand it over.

31:44.496 --> 31:46.497
Your will?

31:46.498 --> 31:49.267
It was just in case.

31:49.268 --> 31:51.936
Just sit still,
don't make any trouble.

31:51.937 --> 31:54.105
You'll live, okay, buddy?

32:01.647 --> 32:05.116
I knew that british accent
was fake.

32:08.353 --> 32:09.687
Gotcha!

32:16.962 --> 32:18.629
No, no, no, what--

32:21.099 --> 32:22.166
Goodbye?

32:22.167 --> 32:23.701
[sighs heavily]

32:23.702 --> 32:24.702
[smacks table]

32:24.703 --> 32:27.138
Okay...

32:27.139 --> 32:28.706
Try not to worry.

32:28.707 --> 32:32.543
Everything's
going to be okay here.

32:32.544 --> 32:35.513
You know, you remind me
of my nephew.

32:35.514 --> 32:37.114
Really?

32:37.115 --> 32:40.117
Yeah, he's
full of crap too.

32:40.118 --> 32:41.519
[coughing]

32:41.520 --> 32:43.688
[cell phone rings]

32:48.627 --> 32:49.994
What the hell
are they teaching you

32:49.995 --> 32:52.063
At quantico these days?

32:52.064 --> 32:54.565
Your guys shot
one of the hostages.

32:54.566 --> 32:56.000
<i>That was
an accident.</i>

32:56.001 --> 32:57.668
Your people had your gun
pointed at a civilian

32:57.669 --> 32:59.203
Who was clearly in distress.

32:59.204 --> 33:00.304
How did I know
you weren't going to shoot?

33:00.305 --> 33:02.173
Any more tricks like that,

33:02.174 --> 33:03.441
And we will.

33:03.442 --> 33:05.576
You know, we've got
your guy out here.

33:05.577 --> 33:07.078
He's got a lot to say.

33:07.079 --> 33:09.480
Then you must have
the wrong guy.

33:09.481 --> 33:10.448
[hangs up]

33:13.285 --> 33:17.255
Plan b. Blueprints.

33:17.256 --> 33:18.522
They're getting
more nervous

33:18.523 --> 33:20.091
With each
passing minute.

33:20.092 --> 33:21.559
I gotta pee!

33:21.560 --> 33:23.261
See what I mean?

33:24.529 --> 33:25.496
[together]: Your turn.

33:30.769 --> 33:33.671
All right, let's go.

33:34.740 --> 33:36.307
It might work.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.409
It's got to work.

33:44.116 --> 33:46.050
Candy from a baby.

33:46.051 --> 33:47.118
[chuckling]

33:50.522 --> 33:51.722
You know,
kate's right.

33:51.723 --> 33:53.424
The hostages are getting
more resttess,

33:53.425 --> 33:54.458
Except for one.

33:54.459 --> 33:55.493
Sean.

33:55.494 --> 33:57.094
Either he's very
good under pressure...

33:57.095 --> 33:58.396
Or he knows
who we are

33:58.397 --> 33:59.397
And why we're
really here.

33:59.398 --> 34:01.265
[cell phone vibrates]

34:01.266 --> 34:02.366
From henry.

34:02.367 --> 34:03.634
Grace is clean,

34:03.635 --> 34:04.969
As are thomas
and cheryl.

34:04.970 --> 34:06.037
And..?

34:06.038 --> 34:07.672
The feds shut him down
after that.

34:07.673 --> 34:09.072
Of course.

34:09.074 --> 34:10.241
One more thing.

34:10.242 --> 34:11.676
Salvage operations are a go.

34:13.145 --> 34:15.679
[engine starts]

34:15.681 --> 34:17.547
Love those out-sourced
kill switches.

34:22.054 --> 34:24.121
Good news,

34:24.121 --> 34:25.523
Now four hostages
have been cleared.

34:25.524 --> 34:27.224
Bad news,
two possible hosts remain.

34:27.225 --> 34:28.292
How many
minutes left?

34:28.293 --> 34:29.293
Not enough.

34:29.293 --> 34:31.195
We should free
the cleared hostages.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.228
Safer all round.

34:32.230 --> 34:33.797
And it might
flush out the mole.

34:33.799 --> 34:35.399
I'll let the feds
know they're coming.

34:35.400 --> 34:39.804
All right, you four,
move to the front door.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.438
You're not going to
kill us, are you?

34:41.440 --> 34:42.773
You're free to go.

34:42.774 --> 34:45.176
I don't care
how much you take

34:45.177 --> 34:46.310
From these bloodsuckers,

34:46.311 --> 34:47.745
Just leave
my christmas fund alone.

34:47.746 --> 34:49.547
You have my word.

34:52.617 --> 34:54.118
You still want to stay?

34:54.119 --> 34:55.453
Not now.

34:55.454 --> 34:56.420
Wait, wait.

35:08.133 --> 35:09.633
Movement inside.

35:11.870 --> 35:13.537
Hostages
front and center.

35:13.538 --> 35:15.439
Nobody fire unless I say so.

35:17.642 --> 35:19.543
All right, go, go.

35:24.516 --> 35:26.784
It might buy us
a few extra minutes.

35:26.785 --> 35:28.486
Just enough time

35:28.487 --> 35:30.321
For me to escape
with george here...

35:30.322 --> 35:31.422
Before he explodes.

35:33.425 --> 35:35.760
Well, well,

35:35.761 --> 35:37.862
We meet our competition.

35:39.890 --> 35:41.590
What are you doing?

35:41.591 --> 35:42.625
<i>I thought  you  were
the bad guys!</i>

35:42.626 --> 35:44.193
[groans in pain]

35:44.194 --> 35:45.227
The famous helen magnus.

35:46.596 --> 35:47.496
It's a privilege.

35:47.497 --> 35:49.532
Now, drop your weapons.

35:51.635 --> 35:53.569
You leave us
no choice.

35:55.138 --> 35:58.240
Let me guess,
bounty hunter?

35:58.241 --> 35:59.809
[chuckles]

35:59.810 --> 36:01.577
Any idea how much
a ferropodous egg fetches

36:01.578 --> 36:02.578
On the black market?

36:02.579 --> 36:03.612
Too bad for you

36:03.613 --> 36:06.015
It's not an egg
anymore.

36:06.016 --> 36:08.150
So? I'll grab the baby
when it pops out of buddy here.

36:08.151 --> 36:10.886
Some payday's better than none.

36:10.887 --> 36:13.989
What? What's popping
out of me? Ow!

36:13.990 --> 36:15.891
And what if
you're the host?

36:15.892 --> 36:17.460
I was the last one in the bank.

36:17.461 --> 36:19.161
George has been here
since it opened.

36:19.162 --> 36:20.563
I know it's not me.

36:20.564 --> 36:22.164
Okay, so
you got my gun.

36:22.165 --> 36:24.266
You still got
no way out of here.

36:24.267 --> 36:26.268
I saw you looking
at the blueprints.

36:26.269 --> 36:27.103
Yeah, but there's
nothing--

36:27.104 --> 36:30.239
Don't test me.

36:32.142 --> 36:34.176
There's a panel
in the elevator shaft.

36:34.177 --> 36:35.411
Leads to an old heating vent

36:35.412 --> 36:38.114
From back in the day when
they used a coal furnace.

36:38.115 --> 36:39.115
And where does it go?

36:39.116 --> 36:40.116
Into the basement

36:40.117 --> 36:41.650
Of the neighboring
building.

36:41.651 --> 36:43.519
From there,
there's a grate in the floor,

36:43.520 --> 36:45.287
Leads to the sewers.

36:45.288 --> 36:46.989
We would have surfaced
a few blocks away,

36:46.990 --> 36:47.923
No one the wiser.

36:47.924 --> 36:49.658
Show me.

36:58.368 --> 36:59.435
There it is.

36:59.436 --> 37:00.636
Open it.

37:12.649 --> 37:14.550
Okay.

37:17.320 --> 37:18.454
[cell phone vibrates]

37:18.455 --> 37:19.588
Show it to me.

37:23.693 --> 37:25.995
"east wall,
five minutes."

37:25.996 --> 37:27.229
What does
that mean?

37:27.230 --> 37:29.098
Our driver's waiting for us.

37:29.099 --> 37:31.400
He's going to have
a long wait.

37:31.401 --> 37:33.135
The rest of your stuff,
on the floor now.

37:40.043 --> 37:41.510
Ow. What--

37:41.511 --> 37:42.511
Gestation vapors.

37:42.512 --> 37:43.345
That's not good.

37:43.346 --> 37:44.713
It's growing.

37:44.714 --> 37:46.081
If we don't get it
out of him soon,

37:46.082 --> 37:47.149
We'll miss
our window.

37:49.186 --> 37:51.053
So, what are you
gonna do now, dave?

37:51.054 --> 37:52.755
He could kill the host,
save us all.

37:52.756 --> 37:54.757
But then the creature dies,
no payday.

37:54.758 --> 37:56.025
He could shoot us

37:56.026 --> 37:57.059
And try and escape
with george here

37:57.060 --> 37:58.494
Before he explodes.

37:58.495 --> 38:00.496
Too noisy. The feds
would storm in immediately.

38:00.497 --> 38:01.564
Looks like

38:01.565 --> 38:02.665
You've got a real problem, dave.

38:04.534 --> 38:07.336
Okay... The vault.

38:08.438 --> 38:10.105
You wouldn't.

38:10.106 --> 38:11.607
Yeah, that'll work.

38:11.608 --> 38:13.776
George here explodes--

38:13.777 --> 38:17.279
Ugh! Would you people
stop saying that?

38:17.280 --> 38:19.181
The ferropodous
gets rid of you guys.

38:19.182 --> 38:20.216
And after having fed,

38:20.217 --> 38:22.284
The creature
goes into hibernation,

38:22.285 --> 38:24.787
Which is when I scoop it up
and escape through the sewers.

38:24.788 --> 38:27.489
It appears we underestimated
our competition.

38:27.490 --> 38:29.358
[chuckles smugly]

38:29.359 --> 38:31.727
Get moving.
Down the stairs.

38:37.634 --> 38:39.001
Don't worry.

38:39.002 --> 38:41.170
It'll all be over
in a few minutes.

38:43.473 --> 38:45.841
Okay, so I'm assuming this
is all part of the plan.

38:45.842 --> 38:47.009
Of course it is.

38:47.010 --> 38:49.111
You'll love it.
Trust me, william.

38:49.112 --> 38:51.247
Who says
I don't love it now?

38:52.649 --> 38:55.317
George? George!

38:55.318 --> 38:56.619
Okay, we've got to be

38:56.620 --> 38:59.121
In the final stages
with this guy.

38:59.122 --> 39:00.589
We've only a few minutes
before the creature hatches.

39:00.590 --> 39:02.291
Help me get him
into the fetal position.

39:02.292 --> 39:03.392
Why?

39:03.393 --> 39:05.094
Less room for
the gestation to complete.

39:05.095 --> 39:06.262
What, so folding him in half
buys us time?

39:06.263 --> 39:07.563
You have a better idea?

39:07.564 --> 39:08.731
No, no, yoga it is.

39:08.732 --> 39:09.865
Kate?

39:09.866 --> 39:11.600
We should be
out of here any minute.

39:11.601 --> 39:12.735
Really?

39:12.736 --> 39:14.837
[gurgling and retching]

39:14.838 --> 39:15.804
Hang in there, george.

39:17.140 --> 39:19.108
Okay, it's time
to tell me the plan.

39:19.109 --> 39:20.376
Remember when I told you
about the new sewer system?

39:20.377 --> 39:21.777
Yeah.

39:21.778 --> 39:23.512
Well, this vault
is an original model #35c.

39:23.513 --> 39:24.813
Reinforced steel door,

39:24.814 --> 39:26.649
But the other three walls
are concrete.

39:26.650 --> 39:28.117
And that is
the east wall,

39:28.118 --> 39:29.251
Behind which is...

39:29.252 --> 39:30.552
The sewer.

39:32.188 --> 39:33.689
So henry's
text message...

39:33.690 --> 39:34.757
Best stand back.

39:43.199 --> 39:44.400
Where is he?

39:44.401 --> 39:45.801
I know, I know!

39:45.802 --> 39:47.636
Come on, hank, please...

39:47.637 --> 39:51.407
[retching and choking]

39:51.408 --> 39:52.741
Oh, out of
time, kids.

39:52.742 --> 39:54.143
We are out of time here.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.685
Who's your daddy?

40:02.686 --> 40:03.819
Henry!

40:05.488 --> 40:06.488
This going to work?

40:06.489 --> 40:07.489
Yes.

40:08.591 --> 40:10.592
[dose hisses]

40:10.593 --> 40:12.594
[gasping and choking]

40:20.103 --> 40:21.203
It's working.

40:21.204 --> 40:22.204
It's leaving
the host.

40:26.209 --> 40:27.142
[screeching]

40:28.211 --> 40:29.311
[kate yelps, stunner blasts]

40:36.152 --> 40:37.820
Well done, everyone.

40:37.821 --> 40:39.154
Kate...

40:39.155 --> 40:40.356
[will]: It's all part
of the plan.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.623
All right,
let's get out of here.

40:41.624 --> 40:44.893
Come on, george. Up you get.
It's all right.

40:44.894 --> 40:46.362
Come on.

41:01.211 --> 41:02.244
No...

41:02.245 --> 41:04.380
No, no, no, no!

41:04.381 --> 41:06.215
Dammit!

41:19.429 --> 41:20.396
[gun clicks uselessly]

41:33.710 --> 41:35.511
Freeze!

41:35.512 --> 41:37.479
Right there.

41:39.516 --> 41:40.883
Yeah, we've been
watching the alley

41:40.884 --> 41:42.885
Since we got here.

41:42.886 --> 41:45.187
Bad move.

41:51.494 --> 41:52.694
[chittering]

41:52.695 --> 41:54.329
I think maybe
it's hungry.

41:54.330 --> 41:55.297
Probably.

41:55.298 --> 41:57.166
I'm just glad
we're off the menu.

41:57.167 --> 41:58.867
Take it to its new home
and feed it a proper lunch.

42:00.303 --> 42:01.503
Cheetos it is.

42:01.504 --> 42:03.405
Come on, little guy.

42:03.406 --> 42:04.907
Taco.
Her name's taco.

42:04.908 --> 42:07.509
What the hell
kind of name is taco?

42:07.510 --> 42:09.445
Well, you see,
there was this dog,

42:09.446 --> 42:11.780
And it looked like a cross
between a chihuahua

42:11.781 --> 42:12.815
And satan,

42:12.816 --> 42:15.451
Who was responsible
for...

42:15.452 --> 42:16.919
You handled yourself
really well.

42:16.920 --> 42:18.220
Holding up the bank?

42:18.221 --> 42:19.655
It's nothing
I haven't done before.

42:19.656 --> 42:22.291
Nevertheless,
you did a good job.

42:22.292 --> 42:24.493
You could've
taken over anytime,

42:24.494 --> 42:25.661
But you let me run with it.

42:25.662 --> 42:27.329
You had it covered,

42:27.330 --> 42:29.498
Right down to the empty gun
in your waistband.

42:29.499 --> 42:30.899
Very clever.

42:30.900 --> 42:32.701
Thanks.

42:32.702 --> 42:34.403
There's just one thing
that bothers me.

42:34.404 --> 42:35.671
What's that?

42:35.672 --> 42:39.274
All that money,
and you didn't even take any.

42:41.377 --> 42:42.778
I...

42:42.779 --> 42:44.880
Isn't that depressing?

42:44.881 --> 42:47.316
[chuckles]

42:47.317 --> 42:48.250
Terribly.

42:48.251 --> 42:50.486
