00:06.006 --> 00:10.010
"Hellfire on Tehran" got
Nicol Trowbridge the bump of a lifetime.

00:10.010 --> 00:12.595
If he's standing next to the president,
he's gonna say it again.

00:12.595 --> 00:15.807
We'll send a carrier group to the Gulf,
give them a ride to Bahrain.

00:15.807 --> 00:16.808
His ship is sinking.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.852
How do you not tell me
the ship is sinking?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.353
Because it isn't.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.814
If the house is on fire, you tell me.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.774
The house is on fire!

00:24.774 --> 00:27.652
The prime minister is setting the stage
for an attack

00:27.652 --> 00:30.113
on American hardware and American troops.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.449
When Hal and I first spoke,
it sounded ridiculous,

00:32.449 --> 00:34.367
but a month later, it seems brilliant.

00:34.367 --> 00:37.495
- She called you a month ago.
- It's the vice presidency.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.414
- You want me to think about it?
- Yeah, I do.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.207
When you said, "We're done,"

00:42.292 --> 00:44.753
- did you think we were done?
- No.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.922
You think they'll swarm the Fifth Fleet?

00:47.922 --> 00:50.800
I think they're gonna load an RPG
onto a fishing trawler

00:50.800 --> 00:52.260
and see what they can hit.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.387
- How are we doing?
No ships.

00:54.387 --> 00:58.516
You're doing great.
Just knock off that "I resign" shit.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.643
It really pisses me off.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.437
I don't have that kind of time.

01:15.784 --> 01:18.203
<i>Morning.</i>
<i>Good to see you, sir.</i>

01:18.203 --> 01:20.246
<i>- She's still upstairs.</i>
<i>Ah.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:22.457
Thank you.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.754
- Good morning.
- Morning.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.214
Help yourself.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.090
You're chipper.

01:31.090 --> 01:33.593
For a guy with a shiner
he got from his wife?

01:33.593 --> 01:34.928
Wasn't gonna mention it.

01:35.970 --> 01:36.888
Good man.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.892
So how's it... you know?

01:41.726 --> 01:43.311
- Going?
- Yeah.

01:43.311 --> 01:44.229
With Kate?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.689
Don't look so scared.

01:46.689 --> 01:48.650
We walk a bumpy road.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.568
Hi there.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.486
Morning.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.756
Still didn't break?

02:11.756 --> 02:13.007
Not in the papers.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.552
Like waiting for an elephant
to drop on your head.

02:16.886 --> 02:17.720
Good morning.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.014
Hello.

02:21.015 --> 02:22.976
The station in Tel Aviv got a tip

02:22.976 --> 02:26.479
that the British government is talking
about pulling nonessential personnel

02:26.479 --> 02:28.356
out of their embassy in Tehran

02:29.065 --> 02:31.860
and issuing an advisory
to British nationals.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.236
To leave the country?

02:33.236 --> 02:34.320
Yes.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.115
- Iran didn't do it.
- They didn't.

02:37.115 --> 02:38.783
So why is the British government

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
doing the things you do
before you go to war with a country?

02:41.578 --> 02:44.622
Maybe it's just a good way for Trowbridge
to keep the Iran scare alive.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.292
What the fuck? Somebody else did it.
Doesn't he wanna know who?

02:47.292 --> 02:50.295
Iran is a good target.
Gets people in a lather.

02:50.295 --> 02:52.714
Is he worried he'll find out it's Canada?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.383
Nobody will be upset
because everybody loves Canada?

02:56.175 --> 02:58.428
See the gala on your schedule tonight?

02:59.012 --> 03:02.140
It's a good place to ask the Brits
about the embassy in Tehran.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.475
Give people a chance
to let you know it's on the table.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.728
- Not what we should be focused on.
Ma'am.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.731
We are talking
to every intelligence service on the map.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.357
We'll figure out who did it.

03:12.317 --> 03:15.904
We're not.
We're not talking to Iranian intelligence.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.197
- No.
- Best in the region.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.951
- Only people we aren't asking.
- We'd reach out to Shahin again,

03:21.951 --> 03:26.497
but someone said it would undermine
the fragile web of relationships

03:26.497 --> 03:29.083
built over decades by the Foreign Service.

03:33.087 --> 03:37.258
Could we get them a message,
like a hidden-in-plain-sight thing?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.885
- You do that, right?
- Sure.

03:38.885 --> 03:40.970
Iran follows everything
we say about trade.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.223
Maybe we put a flag
in a speech about trade.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
Yeah. Or is this a bad idea?

03:45.225 --> 03:47.101
No. It's a good idea. Ma'am.

03:51.105 --> 03:52.148
Mm-hm?

03:52.815 --> 03:55.777
You said someone
at Whitehall was confiding in you.

03:55.777 --> 03:57.237
Can you make a phone call?

03:57.237 --> 04:00.198
About whether they're planning
to evacuate people from Iran?

04:00.823 --> 04:04.285
Tel Aviv got it from a reliable source,
but until it's confirmed,

04:04.285 --> 04:06.579
I don't wanna get Washington all spun up.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.166
- No.
- Okay.

04:10.166 --> 04:14.420
It'll spook him. He's a brand-new source.
You know, he's not a source.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.506
I got it. You said no.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.012
Bye.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.889
Okay, so how about this?

04:24.889 --> 04:27.600
"It's time to resume arms trade
with Turkey

04:27.600 --> 04:29.686
because resolving our differences

04:29.686 --> 04:32.563
and pooling our resources
is the right choice

04:32.563 --> 04:37.277
- both for Turkey and its allies."
- Iran's not our ally, but Turkey's ally.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.238
Nobody's gonna get it
but Turkey and Iran, but they will.

04:40.238 --> 04:44.617
Don't do "pooling resources."
Do "frank and targeted exchange of views,"

04:44.617 --> 04:46.327
with "Turkey and its allies."

04:48.454 --> 04:51.833
In the nuclear talks,
"frank and targeted exchange of views"

04:51.833 --> 04:54.544
is what Iran always said
when they were ready to cut to the chase.

04:54.544 --> 04:57.839
It meant, "Let's meet out back
by the dumpsters and really talk."

04:57.839 --> 05:00.675
Okay, that's better.
See if you can find a place to plant it.

05:00.675 --> 05:02.635
Did you really meet by the dumpsters?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.762
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

05:17.400 --> 05:21.654
You know, I talked to Billie today.
She said you were thinking about it.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.074
- The vice presidency?
- Yeah.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.868
Now I'm thinking about it.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.203
And?

05:29.203 --> 05:30.413
I said no.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.749
Which didn't seem to land.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.876
Yeah, they're enthusiastic.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.462
Tell them I'm getting divorced.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.424
What if this is--?

05:43.509 --> 05:46.179
You know, relationships are hard.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
For fuck's sake.

06:11.746 --> 06:12.580
Thanks.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.124
I'm fine.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.924
- Because of the shoes.
- Understood.

06:29.680 --> 06:30.807
Excuse me.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.602
You have the rich history
of this institution...

06:34.602 --> 06:38.022
I'm all for domestic manufacturing
and reducing our dependence on China,

06:38.022 --> 06:41.651
but if your government and my government
are simply introducing this initiative

06:41.651 --> 06:44.028
to make it look like
they've jumped into action,

06:44.028 --> 06:47.657
five years from now
I'm gonna have a half-built plaza.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.117
- Some semi-built--
- AD Tyler.

06:49.117 --> 06:51.702
I'm sorry.
Forgive me, I have to steal her.

06:51.702 --> 06:52.787
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.334
- The comment about Turkey went out.
- Turkey, the nation.

06:58.334 --> 07:00.920
- Ah. Where?
- Aspen Security Forum.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.839
"A frank and targeted exchange of views

07:02.839 --> 07:06.050
is the right choice
for both Turkey and its allies."

07:06.050 --> 07:09.220
- Anyone pick it up?
- It's been five minutes.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.722
How long do you think it'll take?
We talking a week?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.725
- Walk with me.
- What? What?

07:15.935 --> 07:17.478
We're gonna dance.
Oh. No.

07:17.478 --> 07:20.440
Hey. You're gonna kick me out in a week.
Let's put on a good show.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.607
Oh, my God.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.734
When you do that,
people can see your face.

07:36.539 --> 07:38.040
Is this Stuart's idea?

07:38.749 --> 07:39.584
No.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.587
He thinks he's a marriage counselor.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.464
- Who, Stuart?
- Yeah.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.257
That's adorable.

07:48.342 --> 07:49.177
It isn't.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.060
Gorgeous.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.247
- Okay.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.585
Thank you so much
to the November Greens.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.212
That was just delightful.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.798
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ma'am.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.675
- ...it is our great honor...
- Thank you.

08:29.675 --> 08:33.930
...to welcome Prime Minister
Nicol Trowbridge.

08:42.730 --> 08:45.149
Thank you. Thank you. Much appreciated.

08:45.733 --> 08:49.654
Ah, so I'd hoped to come here
and raise a glass to the...

08:50.738 --> 08:54.909
British-American Business Alliance's
50 years of vibrant friendship.

08:55.576 --> 08:59.121
Sadly... I have something else to share.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.293
I've just learned
that President Rayburn...

09:05.336 --> 09:06.712
of the United States...

09:09.298 --> 09:13.052
who had pledged his support
in a rather complex mission

09:13.052 --> 09:15.263
rescuing our men and women at sea...

09:17.265 --> 09:18.808
saw fit to revoke that promise.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.813
Mm. Smarts, doesn't it?

09:26.399 --> 09:28.484
So I must take my leave.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.987
The... more appealing

09:30.987 --> 09:33.739
and considerably more wise
Mr. Pelham-Voight

09:33.739 --> 09:36.033
will speak on my behalf, and...

09:37.743 --> 09:42.123
I will turn my attention
to our sons and our daughters...

09:44.500 --> 09:46.294
- and bringing them home.
Yeah.

09:47.044 --> 09:47.878
Hear, hear.

09:54.468 --> 10:00.016
With fire for fire,
we shall defend our island home.

10:02.852 --> 10:04.687
And if our friends turn tail...

10:07.690 --> 10:09.108
we shall do it alone.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.532
Well, now we know why he invited you.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.350
Good morning, Mr. Hayford.
Good morning.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.894
How are you today, sir?
Just great. Thanks.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.152
Morning.

10:54.528 --> 10:58.658
- Hey there. Hungry?
- Ah. Not gonna turn down some coffee.

11:13.798 --> 11:19.804
The cartoons are all variations on the
theme of Rayburn as rat off sinking ship.

11:21.806 --> 11:24.517
He's doing a jaunty little dive
in one of them.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.894
Makes him look spry.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.523
- Don't let me stop you.
- Oh. It's-- It's not for me.

11:32.983 --> 11:34.735
Hi.
Good morning.

11:35.861 --> 11:37.113
How bad is it?

11:37.113 --> 11:40.157
The president expects
Trowbridge to apologize.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.910
Trowbridge expects
the president to apologize.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.543
I hear they're calling Rayburn
President Ratburn.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.587
Anyone mention the fact

11:53.587 --> 11:56.715
that Trowbridge knew we weren't
sending ships for close to, what?

11:56.715 --> 11:58.426
- 48 hours.
The whole weekend?

11:58.426 --> 12:01.429
Before he announced it
like it was breaking news?

12:01.429 --> 12:02.763
Press isn't on to it.

12:03.264 --> 12:06.684
He got one tear in the corner of one eye.
Did you see that?

12:06.684 --> 12:08.561
- He's a pro.
- Leak it.

12:09.895 --> 12:10.771
To the press?

12:10.771 --> 12:12.022
That's a dick move.

12:14.066 --> 12:16.902
- You think we should?
- Let's see how today goes.

12:25.870 --> 12:30.249
Rayburn can't apologize.
He didn't lie, he just reversed course.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.584
We're gonna get you on the phone

12:31.584 --> 12:34.086
with the NSC
and the British ambassador in Washington,

12:34.086 --> 12:36.922
- figure out some mutual climbdown.
- Okay.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.382
Any response from Iran?

12:39.049 --> 12:40.593
To our secret message?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.637
Maybe it was too hidden.
Not enough in plain sight.

12:44.638 --> 12:47.183
Well... it could take some time.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.569
I don't wanna talk
about the vice presidency.

12:58.569 --> 12:59.487
That's fine.

13:06.118 --> 13:08.120
Is Mr. Wyler the reason?

13:08.787 --> 13:10.956
Would you consider it
if your marriage wasn't--?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.333
A dead horse?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.710
If it wasn't the issue.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.253
It is the issue.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.638
People have arrangements.

13:29.183 --> 13:30.017
Like what?

13:32.561 --> 13:33.395
Whatever...

13:34.688 --> 13:35.523
works.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.195
I-- I just--
I don't see how it would, I mean...

13:42.029 --> 13:43.113
how would it work?

13:44.740 --> 13:46.033
Separate bedrooms.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.286
Separate lives.
It's a professional partnership.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.331
Sex or no sex?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.124
Um...

13:55.751 --> 13:57.545
Well, whatever you want.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.089
You get to make the rules.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.592
Like, just oral?

14:05.553 --> 14:08.055
Ma'am, are you messing with me?

14:08.055 --> 14:10.307
I was gonna ask for a drawing.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.351
Sorry.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.521
Ah, none of my business.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.738
He wants to be president. Hal.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.906
He's not gonna be.

14:25.906 --> 14:28.951
- He's okay with vice president.
- He is not gonna be that either.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.119
You think?

14:30.119 --> 14:32.288
You think I'm vice president

14:32.288 --> 14:36.834
and he just starts a quiet initiative
to help blind children learn ballet?

14:36.834 --> 14:37.918
He'll have a job.

14:38.502 --> 14:42.506
He'll have whatever job
you want him to have and not an inch more.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.384
If it's kids and ballet, fine, if it's--

14:45.384 --> 14:48.512
Special envoy to Ukraine.
That's what he'll pick.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.316
He shouldn't be the impediment.

15:00.316 --> 15:01.317
- Mm-hm.
- It's not right.

15:02.067 --> 15:05.696
He seems motivated to make this work.

15:06.363 --> 15:10.659
But he's a smart guy, he knows
that he can't pull the stuff he did here--

15:10.659 --> 15:11.827
On my first day?

15:11.827 --> 15:13.913
And then on my second day?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.624
And then on the second half
of my second day?

15:16.624 --> 15:17.750
I didn't know.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.962
With a certain amount of preparation,
I'm sure he can be contained.

15:24.840 --> 15:27.343
I don't think
you've been paying attention.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.237
- What's her name, my person?
- Alysse.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.822
Does she read my e-mail?

15:48.822 --> 15:51.784
Up to you. She did for Ambassador Vayle,
screened out the chaff.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.286
That's happening.
But I didn't ask for that to happen.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.288
I'll talk to her. Can we get--?

15:56.288 --> 15:59.166
I don't like other people
deciding what I read.

15:59.166 --> 16:00.084
Her e-mail.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.461
Of course. I'm so sorry, ma'am.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.340
- I wanna see what you screened out.
- Yes. I didn't, though.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.384
- You didn't?
- No.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.470
- I've seen all my e-mail?
- Yes.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.305
- You said, "I'm so sorry."
- I am sorry.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.766
- But you didn't do it.
- I'm still sorry.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.602
- Don't apologize if it's not your fault.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.354
- For what?
- Okay.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.524
The foreign secretary
summoned the Iranian ambassador

16:23.524 --> 16:25.818
for what I assume
is a face-to-face spanking.

16:25.818 --> 16:26.944
Dennison did?

16:26.944 --> 16:29.947
The Iranian defense minister
is ranting about it on Twitter.

16:29.947 --> 16:31.240
Whoa.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.659
The foreign office copied us,
and I wanna see it.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.576
Uh, yep.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.164
This generation of women
apologize for everything.

16:39.164 --> 16:41.792
Gloria Steinem
must be rolling in her grave.

16:42.459 --> 16:43.794
She's very much alive.

16:44.878 --> 16:45.796
Gloria Steinem.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.173
They didn't copy us.

16:51.552 --> 16:53.262
I thought we agreed to work together.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.555
Yes, we did.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.474
You made a pretty big show
of bringing me into your confidence

16:57.474 --> 17:00.561
and asking-- asking for my help.

17:02.396 --> 17:03.939
- I did.
-<i>Where I come from,</i>

17:03.939 --> 17:06.900
summoning an ambassador
is a public rebuke.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.986
<i>It sends a message.</i>

17:08.986 --> 17:12.322
<i>In Kabul, it's what we sent
before we sent tanks.</i>

17:12.322 --> 17:13.532
Oh, here as well.

17:13.532 --> 17:18.454
Where I come from, one copies
one's allies on giant diplomatic steps--

17:18.454 --> 17:20.372
I'm afraid I'm losing the thread.

17:20.372 --> 17:23.917
Why the fuck wouldn't you tell me
you were summoning the Iranian ambassador?

17:24.835 --> 17:25.753
I didn't.

17:28.005 --> 17:28.839
So who did?

17:30.883 --> 17:33.886
Let me speak in terms
that I know you'll understand.

17:34.595 --> 17:38.223
I have no fucking idea
what you are talking about.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.774
- Is there anything I can help you--?
- No.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.821
The Turkey comment.

17:52.821 --> 17:53.864
They got it.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.492
They got it.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.501
Which way is the CIA?

18:06.168 --> 18:09.463
They got the hint, in the Turkey speech.
They're asking for cover.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.007
They want the Brits to demand
they come in for a meeting.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.551
If it's real, it's clever as fuck.

18:14.551 --> 18:15.677
It's real.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.890
Worst-case scenario, it's not real,

18:19.890 --> 18:22.851
the foreign secretary has a meeting
with the Iranian ambassador,

18:22.851 --> 18:25.145
- says we need to calm down.
- And you.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.981
The foreign secretary and you.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.066
I don't...

18:30.526 --> 18:31.735
No. It's weird.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.613
- Who cares?
- He'll care. The foreign secretary.

18:34.613 --> 18:35.531
I can't ask...

18:37.407 --> 18:38.242
No.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.122
Holy shit. It's him.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.667
- What?
- Am I wrong?

18:47.459 --> 18:51.171
- What?
- I'm not wrong. He's your special friend.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.133
Oh, my God, I am not wrong.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.886
It does neither of us any good
for you to know who my special friend is.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.764
That may be the case,
but it's Austin Dennison.

19:00.764 --> 19:03.350
- Jesus Christ.
- It absolutely does us good.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.393
First off...

19:05.352 --> 19:09.773
congratulations on gaining the confidence
of the foreign fucking secretary.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.901
- Do not ruin this. Do not be a ruiner.
- Why would I be a ruiner?

19:12.901 --> 19:16.280
This is what you guys do, you want
everyone's source to be your source.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.073
- Which guys, CIA?
- Yes.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.287
You came up with a plan
with the Deputy Chief of Mission.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.080
We deployed a coded message.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.082
It elicited a response.

19:27.082 --> 19:32.171
A highly placed counterpart who asked
for your help in curbing a reckless leader

19:32.171 --> 19:36.884
is in a position to receive
what could be game-changing intelligence.

19:37.718 --> 19:40.637
You think it's the wrong time
to make an approach?

19:41.889 --> 19:44.391
How important is
the Healy meeting at 2:00?

19:44.391 --> 19:46.101
- Moderately.
Let's kill it.

19:46.768 --> 19:47.603
Ma'am?

19:52.191 --> 19:53.025
Ma'am.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.194
Two o'clock works.
Great.

19:56.111 --> 19:57.946
Two doesn't work.
- Why?

19:58.655 --> 19:59.781
Because it doesn't.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.326
What if we go right now?

20:03.869 --> 20:04.953
What is going on?

20:04.953 --> 20:08.498
Iran responded
to the thing about Turkey the nation.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.918
Nobody summoned them.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.420
Holy... Wow.

20:13.420 --> 20:17.633
So now Dennison needs to summon the guy.
And she thinks I should be in the room.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.843
- Because I'm a ruiner.
- Yes.

20:19.843 --> 20:22.387
We need to see what they're bringing in.

20:22.387 --> 20:25.015
The Brits are planning
an evacuation of Tehran,

20:25.015 --> 20:26.475
and not telling us about it.

20:26.475 --> 20:28.852
We can't count on them
to share what they learn.

20:28.852 --> 20:31.271
- Can we take her for half an hour?
- Who's "we"?

20:31.271 --> 20:33.732
Dennison's got a 2:00
just off the Durbar Court.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.775
I can bump into him.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.860
I'll have one of my guys
run her over there.

20:38.111 --> 20:40.614
It's not a conversation
she should have on the phone.

20:40.614 --> 20:42.699
- If it's now, I should pee.
- Pee.

20:47.829 --> 20:51.250
I didn't have to pee,
and then she said that, now I have to pee.

20:55.963 --> 20:58.799
Gosh, guys, I have to take a shit,
should I come along?

21:00.509 --> 21:01.593
<i>How's she doing?</i>

21:01.593 --> 21:03.220
She's good.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.847
Seems calm.
She's fake talking on the phone.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.351
That or real talking on the phone.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.354
- She got her eye on you?
<i>- Yup.</i>

21:13.522 --> 21:16.858
Yes. Absolutely.
If we could organize some sort of tea,

21:16.858 --> 21:19.403
or even a lunch, with the dairy farmers,

21:19.403 --> 21:23.573
and the milkmaids, Bessie the Cow,
and then at the end, I can kill myself.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.748
I'm gonna call you back.

21:43.427 --> 21:44.469
Shit.

21:44.469 --> 21:46.471
Fuck.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.515
Ambassador?

21:48.515 --> 21:51.310
Oh. I made such a mess.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.311
Look at that.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.812
- What?
<i>- Very natural.</i>

21:56.231 --> 21:58.734
You need to officially summon
the Iranian ambassador.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.402
They have intel for us.

22:00.402 --> 22:02.904
- Us?
- You and I should both be there.

22:03.822 --> 22:04.781
Absolutely not.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.701
No one but the Iranian ambassador
will know I'm in the room.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.579
There's a back stairwell.
They'll get me in.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.789
"They"? Who, the CIA?

22:13.373 --> 22:17.085
When you asked for help,
you did realize that I would then help?

22:17.085 --> 22:19.963
I didn't envisage
a foreign intelligence service

22:19.963 --> 22:22.591
running an operation from behind my desk.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.676
No one but me will be in the room.

22:25.844 --> 22:29.181
If you're choosing to trust me,
this is one of those moments.

22:32.392 --> 22:34.019
Nice to see you, secretary.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.235
I think you're in business.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.954
Good morning.
Good morning.

22:55.540 --> 22:56.374
Hey.

22:57.417 --> 22:59.503
- Did she call you?
- No.

23:00.253 --> 23:04.216
This is prep for the Dennison thing.
We talked about it yesterday.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.302
- What kind of prep?
- I brought her a camera.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.262
Small.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.056
She's not CIA.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.182
I know that.

23:12.182 --> 23:14.518
This is starting to look
like an intelligence op.

23:14.518 --> 23:17.729
If I could send someone else, I would.
I'd send me.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.315
What if she blows it?
Or someone finds her?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.359
She has diplomatic cover
to be in the room.

23:22.359 --> 23:25.153
For an official reprimand
from the British foreign secretary

23:25.153 --> 23:28.031
to the ambassador of another nation?
Not really.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.033
- Good morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.660
This is ridiculous.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.788
My suits are gone.
Replaced with things like this.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.206
You'll be photographed a lot.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.875
The stylist thought
you might enjoy some variety.

23:38.875 --> 23:40.377
It's like a shelf here.

23:42.254 --> 23:43.088
No.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.006
It makes me look like
the woman from the village

23:45.006 --> 23:47.509
who comes in to breastfeed
when the mother dies in childbirth.

23:47.509 --> 23:48.760
Morning, sir.

23:48.760 --> 23:51.721
- Huh. I'll come back.
- It's fine.

23:52.848 --> 23:57.144
No. You're having an intelligence
briefing. This is all I need.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.690
- Hal?
- Yeah.

24:05.861 --> 24:06.695
See?

24:39.269 --> 24:40.562
Here we go again.

24:41.605 --> 24:45.525
I can tell you if you look like
the woman from the village.

24:46.693 --> 24:49.029
Now that I know what I'm looking for.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.656
If we had that relationship, I'd tell you.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.619
Okay. Thanks.

24:55.619 --> 24:59.497
And I can share my muffin with you,
so you can eat in the morning

24:59.497 --> 25:01.458
even though you don't eat in the morning.

25:02.751 --> 25:05.545
Mr. Wyler is not the only one
who has your back.

25:10.342 --> 25:13.345
I just think that you and he and Billie

25:14.054 --> 25:17.349
are all linking your marriage
and the vice presidency,

25:17.349 --> 25:20.185
and I think it's a false narrative.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.147
The whole point is
you don't have to survive an election.

25:24.147 --> 25:25.232
Even if you did,

25:25.232 --> 25:29.152
the American people have heard of divorce,
they'll get over it.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.530
If Billie wants to talk to me,
she should call.

25:32.530 --> 25:34.491
You're a grown-up Foreign Service officer

25:34.491 --> 25:38.370
and you're spending a lot of time
on my marriage and my clothes.

25:39.704 --> 25:41.081
Because I'm good at it.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.464
I didn't join the Foreign Service
to see the world,

25:50.674 --> 25:52.676
I joined to get out of Washington.

25:55.470 --> 25:58.014
I used to run campaigns. With Billie.

25:58.932 --> 26:03.812
When you actually win the presidency
and watch the courts take it away...

26:06.439 --> 26:07.565
Oh.

26:08.566 --> 26:11.319
Yeah. Yeah, Billie's tough, she--

26:12.570 --> 26:15.573
She got right back on the horse.
But I couldn't take another round.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.744
- Yeah, it sucks.
- Yeah.

26:24.291 --> 26:28.628
But if I had the chance
to get someone good in the door,

26:28.628 --> 26:30.797
no dog whistles, no recounts, I--

26:33.258 --> 26:35.385
Mr. Wyler shouldn't be the reason.

26:36.344 --> 26:38.722
If you wanna get divorced, get divorced.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.602
Stuart, you're a very good person.

26:44.602 --> 26:45.770
I'm not.

26:46.813 --> 26:51.526
The leader of the free world heard
what you had to say and reversed strategy.

26:51.526 --> 26:55.155
- The guy wants to know what you think.
- He wants to know what Hal thinks.

26:55.155 --> 26:58.450
That's bullshit.
Excuse me, ma'am, but that's bullshit.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.618
He does not wanna know what Hal thinks.

27:00.618 --> 27:02.746
Of course he does. As he should.

27:02.746 --> 27:06.499
Hal's one of the great
foreign policy minds of our generation.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.377
- We're a crackerjack package.
- Ma'am, Jesus.

27:09.377 --> 27:13.840
No, I'm part of it, I get that,
I bring a lot to the table.

27:13.840 --> 27:16.760
My self-esteem
isn't that far in the toilet.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.763
Billie told me about this
before you got here.

27:19.763 --> 27:21.264
About you.

27:21.264 --> 27:22.682
Not Hal Wyler.

27:24.100 --> 27:26.061
And it sounded delusional.

27:26.686 --> 27:30.398
And then I met you
and it sounded, frankly, more delusional.

27:32.275 --> 27:34.569
But now I'm getting the idea.

27:36.237 --> 27:39.157
And I've heard
why Billie wants to do this.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.662
Does she know me and Hal are splitting up?

27:50.126 --> 27:51.211
- You tell her?
- No.

27:51.711 --> 27:52.545
Tell her.

27:53.588 --> 27:54.422
You'll see.

27:55.215 --> 27:56.466
Rayburn, Billie...

27:57.842 --> 27:59.677
they don't want me without Hal.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.003
Ambassador Wyler
from the United States,

28:34.754 --> 28:38.258
and Mr. Stuart Hayford,
Deputy Chief of Mission, Embassy London,

28:38.258 --> 28:40.218
for the UNGNA event.

28:41.136 --> 28:44.806
There's a door at the far side
of the hall, past the bathrooms.

28:44.806 --> 28:48.351
- It'll get you to the back stairs.
- Thanks. You're all set.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.813
I'm just gonna run to the ladies' room.
You'll be here after the thing?

28:51.813 --> 28:52.772
Yes, ma'am.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.817
- See you in there. Yeah.
- Yup.

29:26.806 --> 29:30.059
Office of the Foreign Secretary.
How can I help you?

29:30.059 --> 29:34.397
Secretary Dennison is not available,
but he was eager to speak with you.

30:24.697 --> 30:26.616
- He'll be here soon.
- Okay.

30:26.616 --> 30:28.368
Perhaps wait in that room.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.038
And what, jump out?

30:34.749 --> 30:37.585
All right, you can wait by that chair,

30:37.585 --> 30:42.215
then you'll be out of eyeshot
when I open the door to receive him. Okay.

30:45.552 --> 30:47.262
You always have cookies?

30:49.639 --> 30:50.807
Is that a problem?

30:50.807 --> 30:52.058
For a reprimand?

30:52.058 --> 30:54.853
- It's hardly a reprimand, is it?
- It should look like one.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.605
The tell isn't the biscuits,

30:57.605 --> 31:00.650
it's the American ambassador
lurking in the corner.

31:00.650 --> 31:02.861
- How's she doing?
<i>Launched.</i>

31:04.445 --> 31:05.697
Beyond that, I don't know.

31:06.614 --> 31:08.032
<i>You're staying there, right?</i>

31:09.492 --> 31:10.910
Yeah. Of course.

31:10.910 --> 31:13.246
- Please don't get pissy.
-<i>I'm not.</i>

31:14.706 --> 31:17.041
You're playing cops and robbers
with the ambassador,

31:17.041 --> 31:18.293
you should ask me first.

31:18.293 --> 31:19.419
<i>I apologize.</i>

31:19.419 --> 31:20.503
<i>You don't.</i>

31:21.796 --> 31:26.009
I do. It was shitty. I feel bad.

31:28.928 --> 31:30.013
Don't go to Cairo.

31:31.723 --> 31:32.557
What?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.226
<i>Is that less pissy?</i>

31:36.519 --> 31:38.563
What does that even mean?

31:39.230 --> 31:40.857
It means I don't want you to leave.

31:42.150 --> 31:43.484
<i>I think you shouldn't.</i>

31:45.028 --> 31:48.781
And I think you have a work-crush
on the ambassador

31:48.781 --> 31:51.451
and you see why this might be
its own kind of opportunity,

31:51.993 --> 31:55.538
like I said before but didn't believe,
but now I kind of do.

31:57.498 --> 31:59.918
And I think you should stay.

32:02.503 --> 32:03.546
Also for me.

32:09.093 --> 32:09.928
<i>Hello?</i>

32:11.679 --> 32:12.972
- Ready?
- Yup.

32:29.697 --> 32:30.823
Ambassador Hajjar.

32:30.823 --> 32:33.910
Very good to finally meet you,
however difficult the circumstances.

32:33.910 --> 32:36.371
Secretary Dennison, it is an honor.

32:36.371 --> 32:40.541
And this is the ambassador's deputy,
Mr. Farid Namazi.

32:40.541 --> 32:43.086
Thank you for taking the time to be here.

32:43.836 --> 32:48.508
If you wouldn't mind, may I speak with
the ambassador alone for a few moments?

32:48.508 --> 32:52.929
It's fine. Read a magazine.

32:57.558 --> 32:58.476
- Please.
- Thank you.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.527
Ambassador Hajjar, this is--

33:07.527 --> 33:08.611
I know who it is.

33:09.904 --> 33:11.948
This was extremely bad judgment.

33:13.783 --> 33:17.036
No one knows the ambassador's here.
Not even my staff.

33:18.579 --> 33:20.915
Please, have a seat.

33:20.915 --> 33:23.376
My government
would never have agreed to this.

33:23.376 --> 33:25.169
I recommend you don't tell them.

33:26.295 --> 33:30.633
Ambassador Wyler is the reason
that you've not seen a retaliatory strike.

33:30.633 --> 33:34.846
The Americans, in this case,
have advised only caution.

33:41.728 --> 33:42.729
You have matches?

33:44.439 --> 33:45.773
Book of matches.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.693
I've been instructed to give you a name.

33:50.361 --> 33:54.115
An individual who appears to have directed
the planning of the attack.

33:54.115 --> 33:55.700
And provided the funding.

34:00.830 --> 34:02.331
You recognize this person?

34:05.293 --> 34:06.210
As in, uh...

34:14.427 --> 34:15.511
Yes.

34:15.511 --> 34:18.264
To cast suspicion
on anyone from this country.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.348
We understand.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.808
You do not.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.936
The danger is--

34:23.936 --> 34:25.104
It's considerable.

34:26.647 --> 34:27.982
We are their allies.

34:28.608 --> 34:29.859
You sure about that?

34:30.526 --> 34:34.947
Sanctions and sanctions,
you have crippled our economy.

34:34.947 --> 34:38.534
- They're an important trading partner.
- They are a lifeline.

34:39.744 --> 34:42.330
They framed you
for an attack on the United Kingdom.

34:42.330 --> 34:44.457
Our problem. Not yours.

34:48.836 --> 34:51.297
May I ask how you got this information?

34:52.965 --> 34:55.218
We give you a hand. You take an arm.

34:55.968 --> 34:57.095
I apologize.

34:57.095 --> 35:00.515
I know
you've taken a huge risk personally.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.809
I'm not concerned for myself.

35:03.476 --> 35:04.894
- My country--
- Of course.

35:10.858 --> 35:13.027
Do you need something to drink? Water?

35:13.027 --> 35:14.529
- Tea?
- Tea.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.159
Why don't we have a seat?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.001
- Thank you.
You're welcome.

35:32.880 --> 35:37.802
If you think Russians did not send someone
to observe my entrance...

35:37.802 --> 35:40.304
No one will know that this came from you.

35:41.639 --> 35:42.723
No one will know?

35:43.516 --> 35:45.351
Telling one person is a secret.

35:46.102 --> 35:47.395
Two is publication.

35:47.395 --> 35:50.648
We believe that
your country was framed for this act.

35:50.648 --> 35:54.235
So you should not pay for the aggression--

35:55.069 --> 35:56.779
Ambassador, are you okay?

35:59.699 --> 36:01.033
Call a doctor.

36:01.033 --> 36:02.076
Ambassador.

36:04.162 --> 36:06.372
We have an emergency.
This is the foreign secretary.

36:06.372 --> 36:08.499
- He's blacking out.
- Someone's collapsed in my office.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.459
- He's struggling to breathe.
- Call his guy.

36:10.459 --> 36:13.379
- Tell him something is very wrong.
- I can't bring him in.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.715
- You can't be here. Go before he comes in.
- Okay.

36:15.715 --> 36:17.341
Through the back, quickly.

36:18.676 --> 36:23.097
Mr. Namazi, the ambassador has collapsed.
The medical team are on their way.

36:23.097 --> 36:25.474
- He's struggling to breathe and...

36:39.071 --> 36:40.406
He's right in here.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.203
Yes, right in there,
with the foreign secretary.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.164
Is everything all right?

36:48.164 --> 36:50.333
It is not, ma'am,
if you would please give us a moment.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.417
Yeah.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.669
Yes, they've just arrived.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.255
I've-- I've no idea if he's on medication.

36:56.255 --> 36:58.716
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?
- Medics are here.

36:58.716 --> 37:02.345
AED please.
- Beginning compressions.

37:02.345 --> 37:06.015
I was in the--
The building and I saw them rush by.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.559
Sir, open your eyes, please.

37:08.559 --> 37:11.187
If you can hear me,
please, can you open your eyes?

37:11.187 --> 37:13.814
Mr. Namazi.
We're gonna have you step back.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.441
Mr. Namazi. Please.

37:15.441 --> 37:17.068
Clear.

37:17.068 --> 37:19.487
- Charging again.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.406
- If we can get Mr. Namazi some water.
- Of course.

37:22.406 --> 37:25.284
Clear. Resume compressions.

37:26.994 --> 37:28.788
Forty Tenecteplase.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.832
Fifty Amiodarone.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.418
I need you to listen to me very carefully.

37:34.418 --> 37:36.003
He's not alive.

37:36.003 --> 37:37.463
He is already dead.

37:38.422 --> 37:39.966
They need to keep working on him.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.467
He can't have died here.

37:41.968 --> 37:44.220
They need to declare him dead
at the hospital.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.766
We're gonna trolley him out.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.727
Put the oxygen on him.

37:51.727 --> 37:53.604
We can get him to St. Thomas'.

37:53.604 --> 37:56.274
Radio their resusc, flag trauma as well.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.901
Step aside, please, thank you.

37:58.901 --> 38:01.195
- Do we have a lift waiting?
Yes, sir.

38:01.195 --> 38:03.072
The ambulance is at the south entrance.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.907
Give us some room. Pardon me.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.076
Embassy here. Embassy in Tehran.
- The PM.

38:07.076 --> 38:09.537
I'll see if we can get a number
for Hajjar's wife.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.999
- Nothing about Russia.
- No. That can't come from us.

38:12.999 --> 38:16.585
The intelligence side needs to
feed it into the ether some other way.

38:24.719 --> 38:28.681
- Remember, he's ill. He's not dead.
- Yeah. En route to the hospital.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.685
Is he there? I need him right away.

38:33.936 --> 38:37.189
This is Ambassador Katherine Wyler
for the secretary, it's an emergency,

38:37.189 --> 38:39.358
if you could connect me to Pauline please.

38:42.361 --> 38:44.613
- Operations to protect China's--

38:48.993 --> 38:50.244
What the fuck?

38:52.913 --> 38:54.915
Howard, get me Tom Libby at MI6.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.044
Don't be shy, pal.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.089
Did you call Ganon?

39:04.550 --> 39:05.968
Should I call Ganon?

39:06.844 --> 39:08.095
If you want to.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.305
I don't want.

39:12.058 --> 39:13.267
Fucking hell.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.271
Thanks.

39:28.115 --> 39:31.535
How is it possible
that they've not declared him dead yet?

39:31.535 --> 39:33.162
- Longer the better.
- Is it?

39:33.996 --> 39:35.956
Looks less like you poisoned him.

39:38.834 --> 39:41.629
You think they'll say
that I poisoned him? Yeah.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.923
- You didn't, did you?
- Fuck you.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.217
Did you?

39:46.801 --> 39:47.760
Not my style.

39:52.973 --> 39:53.808
Christ.

39:54.683 --> 39:55.851
Fucking Russians.

39:55.851 --> 39:57.561
Yeah, it's bad.

39:57.561 --> 39:58.729
Very bad.

39:58.729 --> 40:02.108
What the fuck
are they doing shooting at my ships?

40:02.900 --> 40:04.735
I mean, what the fuck?

40:08.072 --> 40:08.906
I'm sorry.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.121
- I'm very sorry.
- What exactly is that?

40:15.121 --> 40:18.999
Well, you keep saying "fuck,"
for one thing, which is...

40:19.959 --> 40:22.503
delightful, coming from you, and...

40:23.838 --> 40:26.048
it's the fucking Russians.

40:26.632 --> 40:29.135
The United Kingdom got attacked by Russia.

40:29.135 --> 40:30.678
Why is that funny?

40:32.012 --> 40:36.976
You think it's just my country that
is saddled with this nuclear turd pile?

40:36.976 --> 40:38.936
It's-- It's yours as well.

40:38.936 --> 40:42.064
- I know. It's really bad.
- Stop laughing then.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.067
That's what I'm trying to do,
what do you think is happening?

40:45.067 --> 40:48.154
- Pour me another for God's sake.
- You think that'll help?

40:50.072 --> 40:54.493
We should have lined your stomach
before we started filling it with alcohol.

40:55.911 --> 40:56.829
Um...

40:57.371 --> 40:58.289
Have a biscuit.

41:01.167 --> 41:02.501
They look awful.

41:02.501 --> 41:03.878
They're very tasty.

41:04.628 --> 41:05.504
They look dry.

41:06.589 --> 41:08.382
They're supposed to be dipped.

41:10.801 --> 41:12.052
In poisoned tea.

41:16.432 --> 41:19.810
- It's not funny.
- It's not.

41:20.394 --> 41:23.397
- It's not funny. It really isn't. Oh.
- That's not funny. Oh.

41:24.523 --> 41:27.151
- Oh. Oh, my goodness.
- It's fine.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.069
- It's okay.
- No, I'm so sorry.

41:29.069 --> 41:33.657
No, this might be the best day of my life,
watching you spill something.

41:33.657 --> 41:37.036
- I'm a bloody idiot is what I am.
- It's fine. It's fine.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.871
- No, we can get that--
- Let it air dry.

41:38.871 --> 41:41.248
- Yeah, we can get Louisa to...
- Yeah.

42:30.839 --> 42:31.715
I bought a hat.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.401
Mitzka?

43:33.861 --> 43:36.196
Oh, my goodness. It's been forever.

43:36.196 --> 43:37.990
I just got back from Romania.

43:37.990 --> 43:41.660
Iran did not attack the carrier.
It was Russia. It was Lenkov's guys.

43:41.660 --> 43:43.954
It can't come from us.
It can't come from the Brits.

43:43.954 --> 43:47.541
Your hair looks beautiful,
did you do something different?

43:47.541 --> 43:51.587
You say this every time I see you,
and it's always exactly the same.
