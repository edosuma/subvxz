Don't do anything fucked up.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.597
You leave Bobbi alone.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.308
And act normal.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.062
(engine starts)

13:44.657 --> 13:46.033
Macadamia nut?

13:49.537 --> 13:50.955
Do ya have a favorite nut?

13:51.038 --> 13:55.793
-Um... I like pistachio.
-Pistachios are great.

13:55.876 --> 13:59.588
I like walnuts... 'cause
they look like tiny brains.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.759
Obviously,
if we get a child,
we won't have nuts.

14:03.842 --> 14:07.304
W-We'd be very, very
mindful of allergies.

14:09.473 --> 14:10.808
Will Sam be long?

14:11.767 --> 14:13.644
She's not normally late.

14:13.727 --> 14:18.107
She's super excited.
We, We both are... Yeah.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.069
I'm never late.

14:22.152 --> 14:25.447
I-In fact,
I'm normally
early, yeah.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.075
But I wait outside
'til it's time.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.415
-(doorbell rings)
-Yay!

14:45.175 --> 14:46.176
What are you doing here?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.803
You texted me?

14:47.886 --> 14:49.597
No, I, I didn't.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.933
I just got a text, Bob.
You said you needed me.

14:53.017 --> 14:55.060
Ugh, shoot.
I must've texted
you by mistake.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.272
I, I was tryin'
to text Sam...
Sorry.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.857
So, no emergency then?

14:59.940 --> 15:02.276
-Uh, no.
-Okay.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.987
Well, nice to see you... Bye.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.282
You had a baby.

15:11.660 --> 15:14.288
-But you don't,
you don't want a baby.
-Yeah, it's complicated.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.289
Hello.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.042
I'm Patricia.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.962
-I'm Bobbi's Social Worker.
-Social worker?

15:22.046 --> 15:25.007
She's the nice kind, Tash.
She's lovely...

15:25.090 --> 15:27.176
She's helping us adopt.

15:27.259 --> 15:30.179
-Sorry, you are?
-Her sister.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.723
You said your sister
lived abroad.

15:32.806 --> 15:35.184
Uh, uh, that was, um--

15:35.267 --> 15:36.894
We, literally,
never see her.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.687
Yeah, I just--
I thought it
would really

15:38.771 --> 15:39.855
m-make better
sense, you know,

15:39.938 --> 15:41.315
because we, we
never see her.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.525
Well, we need to speak
to all family members, Bobbi.

15:43.609 --> 15:44.652
We talked about that.

15:44.735 --> 15:47.154
Why is it any of your
business where I live?

15:47.237 --> 15:51.033
Sorry.
Natasha can be a bit
funny with authority.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.326
We have to go.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.161
I told you to wait
in the fucking car.

15:54.244 --> 15:57.039
We, literally, never see her.
Like, never, ever, ever.

15:57.122 --> 15:59.875
Well, you're here now,
and I'd love to ask you
a few questions.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.293
Now's not a good time.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.212
It won't take long.

16:03.295 --> 16:04.755
Please, Tash.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.298
Please.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.096
When was the last time
you saw each other?

16:12.179 --> 16:13.555
Three years ago.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.016
-Nut?
-And what accounted
for the break?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.730
Uh, it really
wasn't a big deal, so.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.774
She dropped out of uni
after me and Dad

16:23.857 --> 16:25.609
busted our asses
to get her there,

16:25.693 --> 16:27.319
went to go and live
with our mother,

16:27.403 --> 16:29.822
and decided not
to tell me about it.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.615
Natasha and Mum
don't speak,

16:31.699 --> 16:34.159
so I didn't think there was
any point in mentioning it,

16:34.243 --> 16:35.494
and I didn't drop out.

16:35.577 --> 16:38.414
I just... realized
I didn't want to study law.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.375
And that she'd rather be
a children's entertainer.

16:43.419 --> 16:44.503
Nut?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.006
And your mother left the home
when you were how old?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.592
I was 12,
Bobbi was six.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.262
What would you say
accounted for her leaving?

16:53.345 --> 16:55.264
She's a selfish bitch.

16:55.347 --> 16:59.935
Our mother wasn't thriving
in, in the family unit.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.603
Our, Our dad was
amazing, though,

17:01.687 --> 17:02.730
and Tash helped out with

17:02.813 --> 17:04.064
some of the day-to-day stuff.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.607
Yeah, nothin' too heavy:

17:05.691 --> 17:09.778
cleaning, cooking,
bedtimes, homework,
parents' evening.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.239
You know, just
day-to-day stuff.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.283
We met one or two
social workers then, too.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.243
Didn't we, Bob?

17:16.326 --> 17:18.203
Would you say
your contempt
of authority figures

17:18.287 --> 17:19.913
is related to
your mother leaving?

17:19.997 --> 17:22.416
You're hardly
an authority figure,
love.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.796
When Sam and I first met,

17:27.880 --> 17:32.801
we were, uh... two
very different people.
(chuckles)

17:32.885 --> 17:34.344
Uh, sorry, uh--

17:35.179 --> 17:36.013
We...

17:36.096 --> 17:38.307
realized that

17:38.390 --> 17:42.936
there was a hole...
Sweaty hands.

17:43.020 --> 17:47.232
And we saw that it was
a, a baby-shaped hole.

17:47.316 --> 17:51.612
-We want to fill
that hole with love.
-Oh.

17:51.695 --> 17:53.655
Uh, yeah, okay, uh,

17:53.739 --> 17:55.783
perhaps we should
reschedule for another day

17:55.866 --> 17:59.453
when we've had
a... a chance
to... regroup.

17:59.536 --> 18:02.372
Bobbi:
No, no. S-Sam will
be here in a minute.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.792
Oh... what's this?

18:07.252 --> 18:09.129
-(gasps) Fuck!
-Ah! Um!

18:09.213 --> 18:11.215
-(baby giggling)
-Uh.

18:11.298 --> 18:13.634
Uh, uh, um.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.344
Uh.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.679
Oh! It's the,
It's the finger trick...

18:17.763 --> 18:18.722
-Bobbi.
-Uh.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.016
Show her the finger trick.

18:22.351 --> 18:24.728
Yeah, i-it's just,
uh, gelatin.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.147
Uh, silly me.
Must've left it out.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.732
Um.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.692
All five fingers, yeah?

18:30.776 --> 18:32.653
(grunts)
Now there are four.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.530
Whoop!
And now there are five.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.115
(laughs)

18:36.198 --> 18:37.658
Gets 'em every time!

18:37.741 --> 18:38.992
(Bobbi/Natasha laughing)

18:39.076 --> 18:40.327
Okay, well...

18:40.410 --> 18:42.621
should probably
be makin' a move.

18:42.704 --> 18:43.997
Gimme the baby, Bob.

18:44.081 --> 18:47.084
-Hi.
-Bobbi, give me the baby.

18:48.418 --> 18:51.672
Bobbi...
give me the baby.

18:51.755 --> 18:54.424
Mrs. Eaves:
Natasha... look.

18:55.425 --> 18:59.054
No way...
Is he asleep?

18:59.137 --> 19:01.056
-Yeah.
-How'd you do that?

19:01.139 --> 19:05.227
It's, uh, it's
the Mesmer technique.
Saw it on Mumsnet.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.895
Gimme,
gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme.
