02:51.651 --> 02:53.944
Hey! Hey!

04:42.136 --> 04:45.144
Daddy, you know... You know what I saw?

04:45.264 --> 04:48.416
It was the most fantastic thing.
Come look.

04:49.852 --> 04:51.645
My son.

04:51.812 --> 04:53.813
Hey, look, son. I'm really busy.

04:53.981 --> 04:56.900
But I'll tell you what I do need.

04:57.068 --> 04:59.694
I need some good luck.

04:59.862 --> 05:01.321
OK?

09:10.237 --> 09:15.074
OK, Mr Lucky, I think it's time
we divvy up the loot.

09:15.242 --> 09:17.201
Look at all of these things.

09:17.369 --> 09:19.162
What a night!

09:20.956 --> 09:24.542
What do you think of this? This is
pretty, here. I'd better take those.

09:24.710 --> 09:27.045
Try that. Isn't that pretty?

09:27.212 --> 09:29.797
I'd better keep that.
That's pretty nice.

09:29.965 --> 09:33.801
I think I'd better take that.
No, you shouldn't have that.

09:35.512 --> 09:38.890
Here, I'd better take that.
You're a little too young for that.

09:39.058 --> 09:43.478
Oh, look at that watch. Hey, I'd better
take that. That's a pretty watch.

09:46.649 --> 09:49.525
I think it's about time
I got myself another knife.

09:49.693 --> 09:51.736
So I oughta give you this.

09:51.904 --> 09:55.031
You never know when a knife
might come in handy.

09:57.618 --> 09:59.744
You want some gold?
There's lots of gold.

10:08.545 --> 10:12.215
You know, I'll bet this is
the most valuable piece here.

10:13.050 --> 10:17.178
It's Bucephalus, the magic horse
of Alexander the Great.

10:18.055 --> 10:21.641
A long time ago,
this king was gonna kill Bucephalus,

10:21.809 --> 10:24.894
because he was so wild
the king couldn't ride him.

10:25.813 --> 10:28.690
He had Bucephalus
brought into a big arena.

10:29.441 --> 10:33.695
And people came from all around,
cos they wanted to see this horse

10:33.862 --> 10:36.948
that was the biggest,
the blackest and the strongest,

10:37.116 --> 10:39.784
the most beautiful horse that ever was.

10:40.536 --> 10:42.662
King Philip goes walkin' out there,

10:42.830 --> 10:46.416
looked at his men
and said "Kill that horse."

10:46.583 --> 10:50.003
Just then, a voice called out
from the edge of the crowd.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.547
It said "I can ride that horse."

10:53.674 --> 10:57.010
Everybody looked around,
they said "Who said that?"

10:57.177 --> 11:00.388
They looked over and it was
a little kid, just about your size,

11:00.556 --> 11:02.306
just about your age.

11:03.767 --> 11:05.893
And King Philip looked over and he said

11:06.061 --> 11:11.566
"Son, if you can ride that horse,
you can have that horse."

11:14.695 --> 11:17.321
So Alexander walked out
into the big arena,

11:17.489 --> 11:21.492
and standin' in the middle
of the arena was Bucephalus.

11:21.660 --> 11:24.620
He was big and he was strong.

11:25.956 --> 11:31.669
And he was pawin' the ground,
and there was fire in his eyes.

11:31.837 --> 11:35.630
There was smoke comin' out
of his nose, and he went...

11:37.885 --> 11:41.763
And Alexander walked up, and then quick
as a cat he jumped up on his back.

11:41.930 --> 11:46.934
He grabbed hold of that long black mane,
and away they went, just like lightning.

11:47.102 --> 11:50.605
And he jumped right over the crowd,
all the way over the stand,

11:50.773 --> 11:52.815
and went ridin' out over the hill.

11:54.485 --> 11:56.861
Everybody said "Phew!"

11:59.823 --> 12:02.492
Smoke comin' out of his nose!

12:04.536 --> 12:06.120
Fire in his eyes.

12:06.288 --> 12:10.166
- Fire in his eyes!
- That's the way I heard the story.

12:12.878 --> 12:15.129
Here. I want you to have this.

12:20.052 --> 12:21.677
Bucephalus.

13:27.536 --> 13:30.288
Dad? Dad, what's goin' on?

13:31.540 --> 13:33.332
- Ow!
- Alec!

13:34.793 --> 13:36.627
Alec, come here!

13:39.882 --> 13:41.966
Take it easy.
Just take it easy. We'll be OK.

13:43.802 --> 13:47.221
- What's happening?
- I don't know. Here, put this on.

13:47.389 --> 13:50.683
Here, put this life vest on. Come on.

13:50.851 --> 13:54.187
It's OK. Here, tie the bottom.
Tie the bottom.

14:02.613 --> 14:04.280
Let's get outta here!

14:34.269 --> 14:37.438
Hang onto that rail! Stay right there!

14:37.606 --> 14:40.149
Right there! I'll be back.

14:45.739 --> 14:49.784
Stay there. I'm gonna go help
these guys. Don't move. Hang on.

15:47.009 --> 15:48.801
- Help!
- Hey! Alec!

15:54.057 --> 15:55.766
Dad!

16:06.528 --> 16:07.987
Help!

16:12.451 --> 16:13.993
Dad!

16:27.466 --> 16:28.716
Alec!

16:35.349 --> 16:36.682
Dad!

16:36.850 --> 16:38.559
Alec!

17:00.040 --> 17:01.540
Help!

46:48.243 --> 46:50.581
Hey! Hey!

47:48.845 --> 47:53.265
He saved my life.
I can't leave the island without him.

47:54.733 --> 47:56.936
He'll die without me.

48:13.703 --> 48:15.371
Black!

48:48.655 --> 48:50.864
Black! Come on!

49:05.088 --> 49:06.839
Black!

50:21.706 --> 50:24.249
"Ode to Alec Ramsey".

50:24.417 --> 50:27.002
I think that I shall never see

50:27.170 --> 50:31.465
A boy as brave as Alec Ramsey

50:32.342 --> 50:35.719
Hunger and thirst and fear and pain

50:35.887 --> 50:38.472
He lived because his heart had aim

50:38.640 --> 50:42.101
horse as black as night to day

50:42.268 --> 50:47.314
A beast, a god, with whom he did stay

50:48.400 --> 50:51.652
They slept on the sand
and played in the ocean

50:51.820 --> 50:55.614
And rode over the island
in a singular motion

50:55.782 --> 50:59.785
Now, here he sits, a hero among boys

50:59.953 --> 51:05.833
With the love of a horse,
much more than mere toys

53:44.867 --> 53:47.578
I'm very happy to have my son back.

53:49.706 --> 53:51.540
Thank you.

53:51.708 --> 53:54.209
I wish you could have
saved his father, too.

54:04.804 --> 54:06.847
You're kind of a pretty horse.

54:54.354 --> 54:57.147
Black! Black! No!

55:09.661 --> 55:11.286
No!

55:12.789 --> 55:15.165
Black! Come back!

55:21.714 --> 55:23.548
Alec!

56:01.921 --> 56:05.048
Yes, I saw a black horse.
It ran thataway!

57:56.327 --> 57:58.829
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

57:59.705 --> 58:01.122
Hey!

58:03.000 --> 58:05.377
What happened to you?

58:08.047 --> 58:09.840
Everything.

58:10.007 --> 58:12.884
Everything? Well, that's a whole lot.

58:13.052 --> 58:15.053
Can't be everything.

58:21.644 --> 58:24.396
Oh, you lost a black horse.

58:27.525 --> 58:30.193
Yeah, yeah! Have you seen him?

58:31.279 --> 58:33.196
Do you know where he is?

58:35.449 --> 58:37.158
Napoleon?

58:38.160 --> 58:41.246
Did you tell me
you saw a black stallion?

58:52.049 --> 58:54.467
Well? What did he say?

58:56.137 --> 58:59.431
He says "Well...
not really far from here."

59:01.809 --> 59:07.647
Just past the dairy...
there's a big black barn.

59:07.815 --> 59:12.861
Then you see a long bunch
of skinny trees that you walk along.

59:13.029 --> 59:16.656
Then you go right by a morning star.

59:17.575 --> 59:19.951
And you keep following that star,

59:20.119 --> 59:23.955
and you see a large patch
of green grass.

59:24.123 --> 59:27.542
Then you stop, and then you listen,

59:27.710 --> 59:31.838
and pretty soon you'll see
just what you been looking for.

59:55.279 --> 59:56.947
Hey, Black!

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.389
Black?

01:01:23.492 --> 01:01:24.993
Black!

01:01:27.413 --> 01:01:29.289
Black, it's you!

01:01:33.419 --> 01:01:35.045
Oh, I want you.

01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:38.965
You OK? I knew it was you!

01:01:58.444 --> 01:02:00.445
What do you think
you're doin' over there, sonny?

01:02:00.613 --> 01:02:03.615
I'm gettin' my horse!

01:02:13.334 --> 01:02:15.543
And you're a thief.
You're a big, fat thief!

01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.839
- Nobody's a thief.
- You are!

01:02:20.007 --> 01:02:22.383
I said, nobody's a thief.

01:02:24.053 --> 01:02:27.680
Who you callin' a thief?
This is my place,

01:02:27.848 --> 01:02:29.682
and I'm thinkin' that that's my horse.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:33.019
No! He's mine.

01:02:33.854 --> 01:02:37.398
Hold on, son. Now, wait a minute.
You hold on there.

01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:42.362
Now, what are you gonna do here, buddy?

01:02:45.366 --> 01:02:47.325
What are you gonna do?

01:02:55.543 --> 01:02:57.836
Easy! Easy.

01:03:11.016 --> 01:03:12.976
Well, maybe he is yours.

01:03:14.270 --> 01:03:18.648
But, you know, I spent all last night
trying to catch this wild horse here.

01:03:18.816 --> 01:03:20.650
All night, I spent.

01:03:26.907 --> 01:03:30.743
You're just lucky I got him,
instead of the police. Hear me?

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:40.795
- He kicked a garbage man?
- Yeah.

01:03:40.963 --> 01:03:42.881
He's somethin', all right.

01:03:43.048 --> 01:03:45.884
Hey, did you have any breakfast?

01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:02.859
Henry, I think he likes it out here.

01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:19.459
Tried cows. It didn't work.

01:04:21.795 --> 01:04:23.463
Five in the morning.

01:04:24.465 --> 01:04:25.506
Chickens.

01:04:28.302 --> 01:04:31.679
They just about drove me nuts.
Huh! Chickens!

01:04:31.847 --> 01:04:36.559
Well, look, if you... if you clean
this stall up in here real good...

01:04:37.645 --> 01:04:41.105
and you, you know, get it fit for him,
I could let you have it.

01:08:13.610 --> 01:08:16.737
Red cards, red cards...
I've got too many red cards.

01:08:24.746 --> 01:08:27.081
Hey, Henry, is The Black fast?

01:08:27.249 --> 01:08:28.749
He's fast.

01:08:31.002 --> 01:08:33.004
Fast enough to be a racehorse?

01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:38.718
Alec, that Black is a desert horse.

01:08:38.886 --> 01:08:41.761
He's fast, all right. Sure, he's fast.

01:08:42.764 --> 01:08:45.099
But he hasn't got any papers.

01:08:45.267 --> 01:08:48.144
Fast or not,
I don't think they'd ever let him run.

01:08:51.356 --> 01:08:54.901
- Henry, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

01:08:55.986 --> 01:08:59.113
Why did you stop training?

01:09:05.162 --> 01:09:06.703
I got tired.

01:09:18.383 --> 01:09:22.636
Do you think you'll ever...
try it again?

01:09:29.478 --> 01:09:30.978
Sure I do.

01:09:33.314 --> 01:09:34.439
Sure.

01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:44.158
It's work.

01:09:45.577 --> 01:09:48.120
Worth... worth it, though.

01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:55.044
Hold on to him good.
Stay in the centre of him.

01:09:55.212 --> 01:09:57.296
Turn him around the other way.

01:09:57.464 --> 01:10:01.634
The other way, son.
Bring him in and turn him around.

01:10:01.802 --> 01:10:05.930
Now send him down around here.
Hah! Hah! Hah!

01:11:06.575 --> 01:11:08.993
It comes as no surprise
that again this week,

01:11:09.161 --> 01:11:12.038
both Sunraider,
the fiery red stallion from the West,

01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:16.626
and Cyclone, the sleek grey from the
East, have won their races with ease.

01:11:16.793 --> 01:11:20.254
And they have won
with monotonous regularity.

01:11:20.422 --> 01:11:26.177
But... hey, hey! Let's see
these two champions run head to head.

01:11:26.345 --> 01:11:29.764
And perhaps horse fans will be treated
to the match race of the century.

01:11:30.515 --> 01:11:34.685
This is... hey, hey!
...Jim Neville from Belmont.

01:11:36.855 --> 01:11:39.940
Lookin' this way. Not lookin' this way.

01:11:40.108 --> 01:11:42.860
Lookin' straight ahead. That's right.

01:11:43.028 --> 01:11:45.488
Hah. Hah. Hah.

01:11:45.656 --> 01:11:48.176
You wanna see what's comin'
in back of you, look under your arm.

01:11:48.909 --> 01:11:51.535
Not over here. Not over
your shoulder. Under here.

01:11:51.703 --> 01:11:56.040
You see what's goin' on
- Down there, all around you.

01:11:56.208 --> 01:11:58.959
And you can scoot and boot. Understand?

01:11:59.127 --> 01:12:01.671
Then you've got...
you've got your balance.

01:12:04.549 --> 01:12:08.010
Pick 'em up. Keep your knees in close
when you put your stirrups on.

01:12:08.178 --> 01:12:10.096
Check down underneath here, too.

01:12:10.263 --> 01:12:12.723
See that you get that leather
outta your way.

01:12:12.891 --> 01:12:15.976
Pull it back in there underneath,
so that your knees...

01:12:16.144 --> 01:12:18.604
Nothin' in the way, here. OK.

01:12:18.772 --> 01:12:21.148
All right, now you're up. Now you're up.

01:12:21.316 --> 01:12:23.693
Feel that? Feel that in your legs? Hm?

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:26.404
Feel it pulling on your legs
back here? Huh?

01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:27.988
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

01:12:28.156 --> 01:12:31.117
Look ahead, down the lane.
Down the lane.

01:12:31.284 --> 01:12:33.661
No, you don't jump straight up and down.

01:12:33.829 --> 01:12:37.832
Just try and keep your body as still
as possible, cos he'll be movin', see.

01:12:37.999 --> 01:12:41.669
He'll be makin' that rhythm.
You just go on with him, see.

01:12:41.837 --> 01:12:44.046
No, no, you don't have to pump him.

01:12:44.214 --> 01:12:47.466
Just... just... just kinda go
straight ahead with him, huh?

01:12:47.634 --> 01:12:50.845
Just like you're... No, like
you're throwin' it away, like this.

01:12:51.012 --> 01:12:52.680
Throw it away.

01:12:52.848 --> 01:12:55.641
That's right.
Throw it away. That's right.

01:12:57.102 --> 01:13:02.022
Look, when a horse starts out of
that gate, you've gotta remember this.

01:13:02.190 --> 01:13:05.735
You don't want him to outbreak you.
You know what that means?

01:13:05.902 --> 01:13:09.447
When a horse starts to settle,
they open that gate... wham!

01:13:09.614 --> 01:13:13.200
Like that.
And some of them just scat... wow!

01:13:13.368 --> 01:13:15.494
So you grab a handful of mane.

01:13:15.662 --> 01:13:18.873
Just before he says "Go",
wham, so he don't outbreak you.

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:23.043
Because, you open that gate,
and you'd just be sittin' in midair.

01:13:23.211 --> 01:13:24.545
You understand?

01:13:25.547 --> 01:13:28.132
- And Black can outbreak you.
- Right.

01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:30.259
I mean, he can move right on out there.

01:14:50.507 --> 01:14:52.633
You know, Alec...

01:14:54.302 --> 01:14:58.848
secrecy... that's the key word.

01:15:00.976 --> 01:15:02.643
Yeah. OK.

01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:06.230
Don't just say OK.
I mean, know what I'm talking about.

01:15:06.398 --> 01:15:10.442
You and me, we have a secret.

01:15:32.549 --> 01:15:36.010
Now listen to me. We'll just
make this a real easy workout.

01:15:36.177 --> 01:15:38.304
- All right.
- Get him used to this place.

01:15:38.471 --> 01:15:41.473
Jake and I'll be right over here,
with Napoleon.

01:15:41.641 --> 01:15:44.518
Now, you go down
to the half-mile pole and watch me.

01:15:44.686 --> 01:15:46.687
I'll start you by dropping my hand.

01:15:46.855 --> 01:15:50.232
Then I want you to work him
for... for a half-mile, see?

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.320
Then breeze him for a half mile,
then pull him up nice and easy.

01:15:54.487 --> 01:15:56.697
Now go down
to the half-mile pole and watch me.

01:16:39.532 --> 01:16:41.325
Come on, let's go!

01:17:10.939 --> 01:17:12.314
Too much horse for your boy.

01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:27.663
Jake, listen. He's gonna be all right.

01:17:41.136 --> 01:17:43.012
Come on, Nappy, let's go.

01:17:58.194 --> 01:17:59.611
Whoa, whoa.

01:18:11.082 --> 01:18:14.043
Go on! That way! Go on, get him.

01:18:15.086 --> 01:18:16.587
Pull him up!

01:18:18.631 --> 01:18:22.551
Pull him up, Nappy!
On the inside. Pull him up!

01:18:27.849 --> 01:18:28.849
Come on, Jake.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:41.070
Hey. Hey, your hand's hurt.
You... you all right there?

01:18:41.237 --> 01:18:42.905
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:46.241
- Yeah...
- Henry, I'd better walk him now.

01:18:46.409 --> 01:18:48.994
All right, go ahead. Cool him out, son.

01:18:55.251 --> 01:18:58.253
Oh! Did you get what I got?

01:19:01.424 --> 01:19:03.634
- Heh-heh!
- Right on the button.

01:19:05.929 --> 01:19:10.224
Jake, that horse has got speed
he ain't even tapped yet.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:16.647
Well, you're...

01:19:18.733 --> 01:19:22.069
What are you tryin' to say? You're not?!

01:19:22.237 --> 01:19:24.279
You are outta your mind!

01:19:24.447 --> 01:19:28.408
That monster has no more business
being out on this track with class.

01:19:28.576 --> 01:19:30.661
He's fast, but he's wild.

01:19:30.829 --> 01:19:33.163
You saw him zigzaggin'
all over the course.

01:19:33.331 --> 01:19:34.456
Yeah...

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:37.584
And what about his papers?

01:19:41.881 --> 01:19:44.383
- He ain't got any.
- He ain't?

01:19:45.176 --> 01:19:46.760
That's taste.

01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:50.305
What are you gonna do,
hitch him up to a plough?

01:19:51.266 --> 01:19:52.599
No.

01:19:55.061 --> 01:19:56.395
I... I got an idea.

01:20:03.319 --> 01:20:06.155
A match race? Cyclone?

01:20:07.282 --> 01:20:09.575
Oh, you... you are too much.

01:20:09.742 --> 01:20:11.869
You are really too much!

01:20:12.579 --> 01:20:15.164
You got me thinkin' kind of crazy, too.

01:21:36.788 --> 01:21:39.873
Squeeze my hand.
I wanna try something here.

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:43.126
You feel that? That's a
pretty good grip. It's not bad.

01:21:43.294 --> 01:21:45.837
We're gonna have to work on your grip.

01:21:46.005 --> 01:21:49.967
You know what I used to use when
I was a rider? I used to use this ball.

01:21:50.134 --> 01:21:52.719
- What does a ball do?
- It strengthens your hand.

01:21:52.887 --> 01:21:57.140
No matter what you're doin',
through the day, use this ball.

01:21:57.308 --> 01:22:01.687
Let me see you do it. Next time you
grip my hand, we'll see a difference.

01:22:02.454 --> 01:22:06.650
This reporter has the hottest racing news
of the year. Hold onto your hats, folks!

01:22:06.818 --> 01:22:09.152
The most sensational match race,

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.947
between Cyclone from the East
and Sunraider from the West,

01:22:12.115 --> 01:22:15.492
is set for the afternoon
of August 15, at Santa Anita.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:20.914
They'll go over two gruelling miles
to prove which is the greatest champion.

01:22:21.082 --> 01:22:24.626
This is... hey, hey!
...Jim Neville from Belmont.

01:22:47.650 --> 01:22:52.237
Well, whoever you are... here we go.

01:23:33.654 --> 01:23:34.863
It's open.

01:23:51.255 --> 01:23:53.632
Sure is quiet in here today.

01:23:54.425 --> 01:23:56.259
Anything wrong with that?

01:23:58.346 --> 01:24:00.013
The Black, he...

01:24:02.725 --> 01:24:05.102
he just... he wouldn't play.

01:24:05.269 --> 01:24:09.564
He just stands there and...
looks out into the rain.

01:24:11.776 --> 01:24:15.695
Maybe The Black is blue today.
You ever think of that?

01:24:15.863 --> 01:24:16.863
Blue?

01:24:18.282 --> 01:24:20.242
Rain, man. Rain.

01:24:20.410 --> 01:24:22.035
Rain, see.

01:24:26.290 --> 01:24:30.377
We're gonna show everybody that
he's the fastest horse in the world.

01:24:34.006 --> 01:24:36.216
You think you know that animal?

01:24:36.384 --> 01:24:38.135
Yeah. I know him.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:40.554
Well...

01:24:41.597 --> 01:24:43.140
I don't know.

01:24:48.062 --> 01:24:50.313
I get a funny feelin'.

01:24:52.150 --> 01:24:58.155
I feel right now that you'd better
let that horse stay wild, Alec.

01:25:02.201 --> 01:25:04.035
It's his soul.

01:25:29.061 --> 01:25:30.061
Easy, Black.

01:26:08.643 --> 01:26:10.894
- He ain't gonna show.
- I don't wanna hear that.

01:26:11.938 --> 01:26:15.273
He'll show. He'll show. He'll be here.

01:26:20.279 --> 01:26:22.906
He probably doesn't even remember us.

01:26:23.074 --> 01:26:26.159
- He'll be here.
- We're ancient history.

01:26:27.703 --> 01:26:30.539
I tell you, he's gonna be here.
He's busy.

01:26:30.706 --> 01:26:32.290
He's a little jumpy, Henry.

01:26:36.796 --> 01:26:39.047
Come on, work him. Get him out there.

01:26:49.141 --> 01:26:51.476
Henry! Are you OK?

01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:54.145
- Where'd he get you?
- Yeah. On my arm.

01:26:54.313 --> 01:26:56.106
- Here?
- On my...

01:26:56.274 --> 01:26:58.942
- It's not broken?
- No! Leave it alone.

01:26:59.110 --> 01:27:02.237
He just nicked me. Will you please stop?

01:27:02.405 --> 01:27:04.781
All right. All right. All right.

01:27:09.412 --> 01:27:10.453
It's him.

01:27:16.168 --> 01:27:18.253
- It's him.
- No.

01:27:18.421 --> 01:27:20.297
It's him, by God.

01:27:21.424 --> 01:27:23.174
I tell you, it's him.

01:27:36.564 --> 01:27:39.149
- Yeah. Over here.
- Yeah, it's him.

01:27:45.239 --> 01:27:47.490
All right. All right, give him...

01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:50.535
Give him a leg up. All right.

01:27:51.245 --> 01:27:57.083
All right, Alec. Remember, this is
our big chance. It's up to you, OK?

01:27:57.251 --> 01:27:59.252
All right, go ahead. Take him out.

01:28:34.163 --> 01:28:37.499
Come on, bring him on. Come on!

01:29:55.703 --> 01:29:58.371
Hey! Hey, he's out cold.

01:30:02.334 --> 01:30:05.920
Get him out of that mane.
Hold him steady, will you?

01:30:06.088 --> 01:30:08.465
- Got him.
- Give me your knife.

01:30:12.678 --> 01:30:14.429
Whoa, sonny.

01:30:29.945 --> 01:30:32.030
Where'd you get this animal?

01:30:36.118 --> 01:30:37.202
- Good boy.
- Here.

01:30:37.369 --> 01:30:41.164
I got them, I got them. Watch yourself.

01:30:43.584 --> 01:30:45.585
Whoa, boy. Yeah.

01:31:12.279 --> 01:31:14.656
What happened? Did I fall off?

01:31:16.116 --> 01:31:17.325
No.

01:31:18.118 --> 01:31:21.371
No, you hung on...
you hung on like a champ.

01:31:32.216 --> 01:31:34.801
What happened? Where's The Black?

01:31:34.969 --> 01:31:37.470
It's all right.
Don't worry about it, he's fine.

01:31:37.638 --> 01:31:40.014
He's over in the van with Nappy.

01:31:46.313 --> 01:31:48.982
We did good, didn't we?

01:31:50.067 --> 01:31:53.361
You did great. You did great.

01:31:56.699 --> 01:31:58.199
You all right?

01:32:09.295 --> 01:32:11.296
How did you like what you saw?

01:32:12.131 --> 01:32:16.050
- Well, I wasn't disappointed.
- Disappointed?!

01:32:16.218 --> 01:32:19.387
Come on, you never saw
a horse run like that in your life.

01:32:19.555 --> 01:32:21.848
Yeah, this could put you
back in the action, huh, Dailey?

01:32:23.392 --> 01:32:26.895
Don't try to get hard with me.
You know I never liked it.

01:32:28.272 --> 01:32:29.522
I need this race.

01:32:30.774 --> 01:32:33.109
I need it bad, and you can do it.

01:32:34.945 --> 01:32:37.655
Huh? Will you do it?

01:32:39.575 --> 01:32:43.077
If that horse goes like that with a kid,
what about a real rider?

01:32:43.245 --> 01:32:44.537
The race!

01:32:45.831 --> 01:32:47.290
Nice going, kid. You got guts.

01:33:01.597 --> 01:33:05.725
I said Cyclone and Sunraider
are the fastest horses.

01:33:05.893 --> 01:33:07.894
I'll eat those words,

01:33:08.062 --> 01:33:10.730
because I've seen another horse
that defies the imagination,

01:33:10.898 --> 01:33:14.859
that runs like a demon possessed,
at speeds beyond belief.

01:33:15.027 --> 01:33:17.362
He's never run a race,

01:33:17.529 --> 01:33:20.949
but he could be the greatest
sensation in racing history.

01:33:21.116 --> 01:33:24.243
So I here challenge the owners
of both Cyclone and Sunraider

01:33:24.411 --> 01:33:28.665
to meet this... this mystery horse
in their upcoming match race.

01:33:28.832 --> 01:33:30.249
This isn't a joke.

01:33:30.417 --> 01:33:33.753
This mystery horse is real,
and I'll stake my reputation on it.

01:33:33.921 --> 01:33:37.590
This is... hey, hey!
...Jim Neville from Belmont.

01:33:42.221 --> 01:33:46.474
Do you know any good j-jockeys?
Real good, famous jockeys?

01:33:46.642 --> 01:33:50.228
There's a lot of 'em.
George Wolf, the Iceman.

01:33:50.396 --> 01:33:52.814
- Iceman?
- That's just what they call him.

01:33:52.982 --> 01:33:54.482
Georgie Wolf.

01:33:54.650 --> 01:33:57.068
They call him
in the newspapers the Iceman,

01:33:57.236 --> 01:33:59.904
because he sits chilly on a horse.

01:34:00.072 --> 01:34:04.283
That means he sits there and he
can wait. He's studyin' the horse.

01:34:04.451 --> 01:34:08.663
He'll be up there, ridin'...
Up there, ridin', goin' on with him.

01:34:08.831 --> 01:34:12.291
Do you know what I mean?
He's sittin' up there, studyin' him.

01:34:12.459 --> 01:34:15.294
Just studyin' him. Studyin' him.

01:34:15.462 --> 01:34:17.422
Just studyin' him.

01:34:17.589 --> 01:34:22.760
Then, when it's time
to make his move, they say "Ah!"

01:34:22.928 --> 01:34:24.846
"Here comes the Iceman!"

01:34:42.865 --> 01:34:48.828
Mom, do you want me to m-mow the lawn
or wash the dishes or somethin'?

01:34:53.667 --> 01:34:54.834
Sure, yeah. Well...

01:34:56.211 --> 01:34:59.380
Why don't you make all the beds and
vacuum in here too while you're at it?

01:35:22.654 --> 01:35:25.823
- Mom, have you read this here? See?
- What is it?

01:35:28.869 --> 01:35:31.954
Oh, yeah. This is more about
that mystery horse, isn't it?

01:35:33.457 --> 01:35:34.457
Boy!

01:35:40.756 --> 01:35:45.551
Remember last year when they gave
away aluminum ballpoint pens for this?

01:35:45.719 --> 01:35:49.388
- The Black is the mystery horse.
- It amazes me, the lengths they go to

01:35:49.556 --> 01:35:53.226
to get people to go to a horse race.

01:35:53.393 --> 01:35:55.436
And I'm gonna ride him.

01:35:56.980 --> 01:36:00.108
- I'll get it.
- What? What did you say? Wait, wait.

01:36:00.275 --> 01:36:04.529
Alec. Alec, wait a... One more second.
What did you just say? Say that again.

01:36:04.696 --> 01:36:07.657
The Black is the mystery horse
and I'm gonna ride him.

01:36:08.617 --> 01:36:10.451
Alec, that horse
is not the mystery horse.

01:36:11.203 --> 01:36:13.579
And even if he were,
you're not gonna ride him.

01:36:13.747 --> 01:36:16.249
It was a secret.
I told you as soon as I could.

01:36:16.416 --> 01:36:19.043
You're not supposed
to keep secrets from your mother.

01:36:22.172 --> 01:36:25.174
- Someone's at the door.
- I know!

01:36:27.136 --> 01:36:28.803
- Mrs Ramsey...
- Oh.

01:36:29.888 --> 01:36:34.100
The Black is the mystery horse,
and you're gonna ride him in a race.

01:36:39.148 --> 01:36:42.525
Oh, well. Well, well, well!

01:36:43.610 --> 01:36:45.987
Isn't this just fascinating timing?

01:36:46.155 --> 01:36:49.073
What's been going on
between you and that horse?

01:36:49.241 --> 01:36:52.535
- I'd like to know.
- Guess you've been talking to Alec.

01:36:52.703 --> 01:36:57.081
Well, I have been trying to! Would you
like to tell me something about this?

01:36:57.249 --> 01:36:59.876
- I'd be very happy to.
- Well, come in. Please!

01:37:00.752 --> 01:37:06.591
Well, it's... it's quite a...
quite a long story, Mrs Ramsey.

01:37:06.758 --> 01:37:10.344
I'm sure it's a long story.
But you've gotta be kidding.

01:37:10.512 --> 01:37:14.140
You think I'll let him ride in a race?
My son could get killed.

01:37:14.308 --> 01:37:18.561
Oh, I... I think you could be
exaggerating a little bit, Mrs Ramsey.

01:37:18.729 --> 01:37:21.814
I'm not exaggerating!
Don't lie to me, Mr Dailey.

01:37:21.982 --> 01:37:24.901
You're willing to risk his life?
I am not.

01:37:25.068 --> 01:37:27.153
- Mrs Ramsey...
- I lost a husband.

01:37:27.321 --> 01:37:29.280
I'm not losing a son.

01:37:29.448 --> 01:37:33.784
Oh, I wouldn't... I wouldn't hurt
that boy for anything in the world.

01:37:34.828 --> 01:37:38.664
What kind of dreams
are you filling up his head with? Huh?

01:37:39.917 --> 01:37:42.585
It's much more than just a race.

01:37:43.503 --> 01:37:47.131
Your son has his... his heart set on it.

01:37:49.718 --> 01:37:51.385
Goodbye, Mr Dailey.

01:37:52.930 --> 01:37:54.555
Goodbye, Mrs Ramsey.

01:38:14.076 --> 01:38:17.245
So what happened to the new deal, huh?
The clean slate?

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:26.295
Alec, I can't let you do it.
I can't let you ride in a horse race.

01:38:26.463 --> 01:38:27.922
It's ridiculous!

01:38:32.719 --> 01:38:33.719
I'm sorry.

01:38:46.858 --> 01:38:48.067
What is that?

01:38:49.736 --> 01:38:51.988
Alexander the Great's horse.

01:39:07.838 --> 01:39:09.964
Dad g-gave it to me.

01:39:11.842 --> 01:39:13.759
Just before the storm.

01:39:23.312 --> 01:39:29.025
It reminded me of... The Black and me.

01:39:32.070 --> 01:39:38.075
Alexander's father...
gave it to him... before he died.

01:39:44.708 --> 01:39:47.626
I was... in the water.

01:39:49.379 --> 01:39:51.589
I couldn't breathe.

01:39:51.757 --> 01:39:53.591
It was dark, and...

01:39:54.968 --> 01:39:56.302
I...

01:40:01.683 --> 01:40:03.809
I yelled out for Dad, but...

01:40:07.356 --> 01:40:11.734
I looked up and... there was The Black.

01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:15.571
And I grabbed onto him.

01:40:15.739 --> 01:40:17.740
He saved your life, didn't he?

01:40:33.715 --> 01:40:35.299
Oh, Alec.

01:40:39.471 --> 01:40:41.055
What am I gonna do?

01:40:49.439 --> 01:40:51.065
I gotta ride.

01:41:16.425 --> 01:41:17.550
OK.

01:42:22.282 --> 01:42:24.909
Neville planned the publicity, huh?

01:42:25.076 --> 01:42:27.578
I'll bet the mystery horse
don't even show.

01:42:36.046 --> 01:42:38.047
I'll beat him.

01:42:39.758 --> 01:42:43.427
- I heard Mendoza's just come in.
- Who's missing from the room?

01:42:43.595 --> 01:42:46.931
- That beats him, right there.
- Yeah. Who rides him?

01:42:47.098 --> 01:42:51.519
- Where does that jock get them silks?
- Looks like he's ready for Hallowe'en.

01:42:51.686 --> 01:42:53.354
It sure does!

01:42:58.777 --> 01:43:00.861
Rider number one up.

01:43:05.992 --> 01:43:10.120
- Number one, sir.
- Number one, add two pounds.

01:43:10.288 --> 01:43:12.414
- Got that, George?
- Add two.

01:43:23.093 --> 01:43:24.969
Rider number two.

01:43:28.473 --> 01:43:29.515
Thank you.

01:43:30.809 --> 01:43:32.560
Rider number three.

01:43:37.607 --> 01:43:39.191
Number three?

01:43:39.359 --> 01:43:41.652
- Number three?
- How do I look?

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:45.656
- Number three, please.
- I don't think he's gonna show.

01:43:45.824 --> 01:43:48.242
- It's been a joke.
- ...rider number three.

01:43:54.624 --> 01:43:56.333
Well!

01:44:00.714 --> 01:44:05.009
Ha! The mystery rider. Hop on the scale.

01:44:05.176 --> 01:44:07.052
He's not strong enough to go two miles.

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:08.887
No way. He's too small.

01:44:09.055 --> 01:44:12.975
- Rider on the scale, please.
- He's on the scale, sir.

01:44:13.143 --> 01:44:14.935
He's on the scale?

01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:19.189
Add it on.

01:45:44.859 --> 01:45:47.236
OK. All right.

01:45:49.364 --> 01:45:53.325
OK, take him out.
All right, bring him right on out.

01:46:16.599 --> 01:46:20.978
Sunraider, ridden by Doug Piper.

01:46:21.813 --> 01:46:25.733
And the black horse,
the mystery horse, is number three.

01:46:29.696 --> 01:46:32.030
East-West Classic, two miles.

01:46:32.198 --> 01:46:35.284
They'll come by the stands
one time, then around again.

01:46:46.212 --> 01:46:48.505
Excitement centres on the mystery horse.

01:47:43.728 --> 01:47:46.021
He's moving on the mystery horse.

01:49:19.449 --> 01:49:21.169
There's some problem
with the mystery horse.

01:49:46.976 --> 01:49:48.977
Cyclone keeping the pace.

01:50:18.341 --> 01:50:20.217
They're on the final turn now.

01:53:05.758 --> 01:53:08.260
He won! The mystery horse won!

01:53:21.190 --> 01:53:23.567
This... this, ladies and gentlemen...

01:54:02.190 --> 01:54:04.524
This horse has got a leg like iron.

01:54:05.401 --> 01:54:06.902
It's gonna be all right, son.

01:54:09.947 --> 01:54:11.573
Henry!
