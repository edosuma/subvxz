WEBVTT

05:21.454 --> 05:24.592
Uh. God dammit!

05:43.744 --> 05:45.813
<i>She's talking about when</i>
<i>she was born back in the '30s.</i>

05:45.847 --> 05:47.548
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

05:47.582 --> 05:48.916
<i>She's talking</i>
<i>about her childhood.</i>

05:48.950 --> 05:50.551
- <i>Back East?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

05:50.585 --> 05:52.720
<i>So, you know,</i>
<i>for her, that's the time</i>

05:52.753 --> 05:54.722
<i>that she's living in,</i>
<i>because those are the only</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:56.858
<i>memories that her brain</i>
<i>is able to retrieve right now.</i>

05:56.891 --> 05:58.860
<i>I see.</i>

05:58.893 --> 06:01.062
<i>And so, and, you know,</i>
<i>I was not a part of her life</i>

06:01.095 --> 06:06.433
<i>then, and so that-- so</i>
<i>I am not in her world.</i>

06:06.466 --> 06:07.902
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>And she knows it clearly.</i>

06:07.935 --> 06:11.138
<i>Life is a bunch of</i>
<i>experiences--</i>

06:12.773 --> 06:15.475
<i>--and I think</i>
<i>just to answer...</i>

07:18.105 --> 07:19.607
Why are you calling me?

07:19.640 --> 07:22.710
Why
are you calling me?

07:22.743 --> 07:24.979
I told you when I have it,
I'll let you know.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.747
How has that changed?

07:26.781 --> 07:28.082
How has anything changed?

07:31.852 --> 07:34.088
You-

07:34.121 --> 07:36.924
you know, they said
within 90 days, what can I do?

07:39.060 --> 07:40.795
Yeah. I'm-I'm waiting too.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.530
Listen,
I gotta keep the line open.

07:42.563 --> 07:44.198
You hear me?
Don't call!

11:01.428 --> 11:02.897
Work call?

11:08.435 --> 11:10.437
Yeah, something like that.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.018
I used to run an auto shop,

11:26.153 --> 11:28.155
I had to close it down,

11:28.189 --> 11:29.290
or decided to close it down.

11:29.323 --> 11:31.192
Got rid of the whole thing.

11:31.959 --> 11:34.962
Now I got three
ex-employees hounding me

11:34.995 --> 11:37.865
for back
pay for being dead beats.

11:38.667 --> 11:43.871
So just turn
your phone off for now.

11:43.904 --> 11:48.309
I can't, I'm waiting
for someone to call.

11:48.342 --> 11:49.843
Who?

11:56.317 --> 12:01.222
Uh, she's-she's my wife-- well,
she's my wife, actually,

12:01.255 --> 12:04.992
but she's
living long distance.

12:07.428 --> 12:08.896
Mm.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.734
You guys look good together.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.204
Well, we are good together.

12:19.907 --> 12:22.510
So she's calling
to coordinate a time?

12:25.580 --> 12:26.847
Yeah.

12:28.482 --> 12:30.050
Well, I thought
about surprising her,

12:30.084 --> 12:31.553
but she doesn't like surprises.

12:31.586 --> 12:34.288
So I thought I tell
her that I'm coming,

12:34.321 --> 12:35.923
but she won't
return my phone calls.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.860
Oh!

13:43.357 --> 13:44.526
Are you all right?

13:44.559 --> 13:45.926
Uh?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.595
All right.

13:47.629 --> 13:51.999
Uh, it's me, uh,

13:59.607 --> 14:01.308
That's not it Jules.

14:01.342 --> 14:04.512
I-- Jules,
listen, I-I wanna talk.

14:04.546 --> 14:05.613
I-I wanna see you.

14:05.647 --> 14:07.047
That's-that's-that's what.

14:11.352 --> 14:12.920
Look, we can do this.

14:12.953 --> 14:16.156
We can do this later in-person.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.958
Let me just
get back on the road,

14:17.991 --> 14:21.428
I'll be there
in a couple of days.

14:30.605 --> 14:34.074
What do you mean moved on?

14:34.108 --> 14:35.643
What-what
are you talking about?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.946
Please tell me!

14:48.088 --> 14:50.023
What do you think
I've been doing?

14:51.225 --> 14:52.527
Who are you with?

14:53.961 --> 14:55.530
Are you back together with him?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.068
I changed my life for you.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.571
You're never gonna be
better than me and you, Jules.

15:03.605 --> 15:05.372
You're never gonna be
better than me and you!

15:05.406 --> 15:07.141
You're never gonna be
better than me and you!

15:07.174 --> 15:09.276
You're never gonna be
better than me and you!

20:54.889 --> 20:57.024
Hello?

21:01.596 --> 21:02.764
Hello?

21:02.797 --> 21:04.599
I'm from next door.

21:16.644 --> 21:18.278
Hello?

24:21.796 --> 24:23.130
How you feeling?

24:27.068 --> 24:28.970
No, I know a quick
little way through here if

24:29.003 --> 24:30.137
you let me show you.

24:30.938 --> 24:33.507
Just right up
and then

24:33.541 --> 24:35.242
just-- I-I could
take you over there.

24:40.181 --> 24:41.682
Ain't gonna cost you much.

24:41.716 --> 24:44.085
I'd be more
than happy to do it.

24:46.654 --> 24:47.722
Come on.

24:51.659 --> 24:54.228
Can't, I'm-I'm
waiting for someone.

24:57.832 --> 24:59.133
Come on, Elliot.

25:00.868 --> 25:02.036
I can bring you.

25:03.070 --> 25:04.705
I know where we're going.

29:20.528 --> 29:21.929
Excuse me.

29:27.268 --> 29:30.170
This is my, um--

29:30.204 --> 29:32.106
excuse me.

35:06.340 --> 35:07.809
Here we are.

35:09.677 --> 35:11.244
Enjoy your meal.

35:29.831 --> 35:31.498
That's not what I ordered.

35:31.532 --> 35:33.701
It's on the house.

36:25.720 --> 36:26.888
Is something wrong?

36:33.460 --> 36:34.862
Do I know you?

36:34.896 --> 36:36.964
I don't think so.

36:36.998 --> 36:38.766
Who are you?

36:44.304 --> 36:47.274
You didn't, um,
you didn't like your food?

36:48.810 --> 36:49.911
Mm-mm.

36:49.944 --> 36:51.579
Why don't you send it back?

36:54.381 --> 36:55.850
I don't trust that waitress.

37:01.989 --> 37:03.891
I hope I'm not--

37:03.925 --> 37:05.760
don't
let me ruin your appetite.

37:05.793 --> 37:06.861
What are you doing here?

37:07.360 --> 37:08.663
Uh...

37:08.696 --> 37:10.297
Nobody else here
says anything to me.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.968
The waitress talks to you.

37:16.436 --> 37:18.371
The others
are slowly disappearing.

37:18.405 --> 37:20.474
Everything fades under the sun.

37:21.876 --> 37:23.678
You just got here.

37:23.711 --> 37:25.980
Believe me, we have
more in common than you think.

37:31.418 --> 37:32.553
Like what?

37:34.822 --> 37:37.024
Nobody talks to me either.

37:40.895 --> 37:43.664
Are you sure
we don't know each other?

37:49.837 --> 37:50.905
What is that?

37:52.707 --> 37:53.775
It's nothing.

37:53.808 --> 37:55.475
A good luck charm.

37:56.043 --> 37:58.646
Well, if it's nothing,
why don't you show it to me?

38:01.616 --> 38:04.685
[ominous instrumental

39:08.082 --> 39:09.150
Hey.

39:09.183 --> 39:11.552
Hey, you need help?

39:12.553 --> 39:13.921
What are you doing here?

39:13.955 --> 39:15.756
Uh, just-just walking.

39:17.424 --> 39:18.726
Did you follow me?

39:19.160 --> 39:21.629
Oh, come on.
I thought that we were friends.

39:21.662 --> 39:23.030
What do you got there?

39:23.064 --> 39:24.899
A box.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.569
Okay.

39:30.037 --> 39:31.906
Okay, right here,
right here, right here.

39:31.939 --> 39:33.507
Oh!

39:34.208 --> 39:35.475
Oh.

39:37.044 --> 39:38.679
No!

39:44.018 --> 39:45.653
God!

39:45.686 --> 39:46.787
No, it's okay.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.877
Are you--
are you gonna be all right?

40:45.513 --> 40:46.580
Sure.

40:51.085 --> 40:52.153
Uh...

40:57.291 --> 40:59.627
Why don't I walk
you to your room?

41:00.995 --> 41:03.463
I don't need your help,
fancy pants.

41:08.569 --> 41:11.739
- I'll walk you to your room.
- No. Goodnight.

41:13.975 --> 41:15.042
Goodnight.

41:17.611 --> 41:18.679
Thank you.

47:05.959 --> 47:07.328
What?

47:07.361 --> 47:09.263
You're dressed
the same as yesterday.

47:11.031 --> 47:13.133
I lost my suitcase
on my way here.

47:17.237 --> 47:20.107
-How are you feeling?
-What do you mean?

47:20.140 --> 47:21.942
You seemed off.

47:24.111 --> 47:25.513
You had a bit much last night.

47:29.584 --> 47:34.054
I was-- I was fine. I'm fine.

47:37.659 --> 47:39.393
So you remember last night?

47:42.062 --> 47:43.897
Do you
remember last night?

47:43.931 --> 47:44.998
Sure.

47:46.634 --> 47:47.901
Good.

48:18.232 --> 48:20.000
I might go to the pool later.

48:20.033 --> 48:22.269
Oh, yeah. Yeah, me too.

48:24.606 --> 48:25.906
Good.

48:26.541 --> 48:28.442
Maybe I'll see you there.

48:28.475 --> 48:30.678
Great. Hey.

48:30.712 --> 48:32.680
-Hmm?
-Uh...

48:33.013 --> 48:37.184
Uh, I'm-- I'm sorry
about earlier. Breakfast.

48:39.554 --> 48:43.457
I think I just got up on the
wrong side this morning,

48:43.490 --> 48:45.159
you know?

48:47.361 --> 48:48.429
Yeah.

48:54.602 --> 48:56.003
-Okay then.
-Okay.

50:15.850 --> 50:18.085
Okay. In a minute.

50:22.489 --> 50:23.658
Hold on.

50:25.527 --> 50:26.694
Hold on.

50:36.169 --> 50:37.772
Just a minute.

50:46.446 --> 50:47.549
I'm sorry. I can't--

50:47.582 --> 50:49.283
I'm so sorry to barge in.

50:49.316 --> 50:51.519
Um, I forgot to mention,
I lost my wallet last night.

50:51.553 --> 50:54.354
I think I might have dropped it
in here. Can you please check?

50:55.389 --> 50:57.391
-I haven't seen it.
-I'm so sorry to barge in.

50:57.424 --> 50:59.192
It's really important
for me to find that wallet.

50:59.226 --> 51:01.629
Um, can you please
go check the bathroom?

51:02.095 --> 51:04.431
I don't wanna go through
your lady's stuff, just--

51:05.165 --> 51:06.466
Sure, sure.

51:06.500 --> 51:07.835
-Hold on.
-Thank you.

51:12.239 --> 51:13.407
You see it?

51:13.841 --> 51:18.111
- No, I don't.
- It's a black wallet, square.

51:19.581 --> 51:20.648
Keep looking.

51:25.587 --> 51:29.356
Uh, I don't see it.

51:35.730 --> 51:38.298
- Yeah?
- It's not here.

51:41.836 --> 51:43.103
Huh.

51:44.171 --> 51:45.405
You don't see it, huh?

51:47.642 --> 51:49.376
-I don't see it.
-Mm...

51:50.310 --> 51:52.580
-Oh!
-Oh!

51:54.247 --> 51:55.850
- Okay.
- Fantastic.

51:55.883 --> 51:57.819
-Great. Good.
-There it is.

51:58.653 --> 52:01.488
Yeah. Great.
I'm glad you found it.

52:01.889 --> 52:03.658
-Well, thanks Julie.
-Julie?

52:04.058 --> 52:06.360
-It's Greta.
-Right.

52:06.393 --> 52:07.729
-Yeah.
-Greta.

52:08.195 --> 52:09.831
Yeah. I'm-- I'm bad with names.

52:09.864 --> 52:12.432
-It's okay.
-I'm Elliot.

52:13.001 --> 52:15.903
Yes. See you later. Elliot.

52:16.104 --> 52:17.404
Elliot.

56:53.014 --> 56:54.081
Oh!

57:14.035 --> 57:15.169
Patrick?

57:36.223 --> 57:39.060
Bring Patrick to me,
allow me to return

57:39.093 --> 57:41.595
with him
and you will be rewarded.

57:43.064 --> 57:45.599
No, river only
flows downstream.

57:51.105 --> 57:52.940
I have much
gold for you in return.

57:52.974 --> 57:54.875
Price will be high
for me to bring him to you.

58:12.727 --> 58:14.729
What if I find him myself?

58:14.762 --> 58:15.896
Price will be high.

58:20.334 --> 58:22.837
In that case, get him for me?

58:26.907 --> 58:29.010
You wanna walk into the light?

58:31.112 --> 58:33.014
Give me one
last thing from you.

1:01:26.887 --> 1:01:28.122
Ah.

1:01:28.155 --> 1:01:29.223
Ah.

1:01:31.392 --> 1:01:32.760
Ah.

1:01:34.495 --> 1:01:35.996
Ah.

1:01:54.215 --> 1:01:55.282
Ah.

1:02:40.461 --> 1:02:41.862
What is he?

1:02:50.838 --> 1:02:52.406
-Get out of here!
-What is this about?

1:02:52.439 --> 1:02:54.408
Get out! Get out!

1:02:54.441 --> 1:02:55.909
Uh, why are you doing
this to me?

1:02:57.044 --> 1:02:58.345
Is this--
is this some kind of--

1:02:58.379 --> 1:03:00.047
Is this some kind
of a sick joke?

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:01.549
I don't know what
you're talking about right now,

1:03:01.583 --> 1:03:03.017
but you need
to leave right now.

1:03:03.050 --> 1:03:05.520
What is he?

1:03:05.754 --> 1:03:07.187
What-- what-- what is he?

1:03:07.656 --> 1:03:09.423
I don't need
to tell you anything.

1:03:09.456 --> 1:03:12.192
I think you do.
I think you do.

1:03:13.027 --> 1:03:14.128
Huh?

1:03:14.161 --> 1:03:16.964
Tell me, what is he?

1:03:16.997 --> 1:03:18.832
-Tell me!
-Patrick was my husband.

1:03:22.936 --> 1:03:24.138
Bullshit.

1:03:30.044 --> 1:03:31.345
I'm your husband.

1:03:33.414 --> 1:03:36.317
I'm your husband.

1:03:36.350 --> 1:03:39.920
Do you know why
I drove all the way out here?

1:03:39.953 --> 1:03:44.091
Do you know
why I came out here? Huh?

1:03:47.562 --> 1:03:48.962
What do you-- what do you--

1:03:49.196 --> 1:03:50.632
what do you--
why are you doing this?

1:03:50.665 --> 1:03:52.833
Tell me, why are you
doing this to me, Julie?

1:03:53.300 --> 1:03:55.035
- Huh?
- I'm not Julie.

1:03:55.069 --> 1:03:56.503
Yes, you are.

1:03:56.771 --> 1:03:59.239
You're Julie and he's Patrick.

1:04:01.442 --> 1:04:03.611
Why are you doing this? Huh?

1:04:03.645 --> 1:04:06.847
Patrick was my husband.
I'm not Julie.

1:04:09.216 --> 1:04:10.284
Stop!

1:04:10.317 --> 1:04:11.919
Stop playing games with me!

1:05:17.117 --> 1:05:18.185
Julie?

1:06:14.475 --> 1:06:15.610
Are you okay?

1:06:20.682 --> 1:06:21.982
All right.

1:06:24.519 --> 1:06:26.654
Uh, if I believe you...

1:06:30.692 --> 1:06:32.292
and I just need to--

1:06:32.326 --> 1:06:37.532
Can you please just--
your name is Greta?

1:06:39.299 --> 1:06:40.367
Yes.

1:06:42.503 --> 1:06:43.571
Okay.

1:06:45.239 --> 1:06:49.243
Can you please
tell me who Patrick is to you?

1:06:51.646 --> 1:06:54.782
He is--
well, was my husband.

1:06:57.150 --> 1:06:58.686
Patrick was a scientist.

1:07:00.087 --> 1:07:04.458
He created P2.
This is P2.

1:07:08.730 --> 1:07:10.197
What happened to him?

1:07:12.266 --> 1:07:13.400
He died.

1:07:15.102 --> 1:07:18.071
Patrick developed P2 for years.

1:07:22.209 --> 1:07:26.380
First, privately then
needed more funding

1:07:27.782 --> 1:07:30.150
so he got Tantalum involved.

1:07:31.218 --> 1:07:36.290
When he got to prototype stage,
they took control and ownership

1:07:36.323 --> 1:07:38.693
of the project
and pushed him out.

1:07:51.171 --> 1:07:52.406
So he's a robot.

1:07:53.708 --> 1:07:55.543
He's not
fully functioning yet.

1:07:56.544 --> 1:07:59.479
He was offline and
inoperative when I found him,

1:08:01.415 --> 1:08:03.350
that's why
I'm staying here for now.

1:08:04.752 --> 1:08:06.821
Reactivation is a process.

1:08:09.657 --> 1:08:12.760
When do you
plan to reactivate him?

1:08:13.828 --> 1:08:15.262
Underway now.

1:08:15.997 --> 1:08:20.568
He's in startup and
calibration. It takes time.

1:08:21.335 --> 1:08:24.739
When he is fully functional
it will be easier to travel.

1:08:26.574 --> 1:08:27.709
Where are you going?

1:08:30.712 --> 1:08:32.714
I don't wanna get you involved.

1:08:42.389 --> 1:08:44.692
I think it's
a little late for that.

1:08:47.695 --> 1:08:50.230
I helped Patrick
when he was alive.

1:08:51.465 --> 1:08:53.200
He shared everything with me.

1:08:54.602 --> 1:08:56.638
There were
administrative privileges

1:08:56.671 --> 1:08:59.272
that no one else
knew about except for me.

1:09:00.407 --> 1:09:03.310
So now the company
is looking for me.

1:09:03.745 --> 1:09:05.747
They want P2 back for sure.

1:09:09.449 --> 1:09:10.785
You're hiding out.

1:09:13.420 --> 1:09:14.488
Wow!

1:09:16.390 --> 1:09:21.495
So Patrick designed
P2 to look like him?

1:09:22.563 --> 1:09:24.398
A somewhat younger
version, yes.

1:09:24.431 --> 1:09:26.400
-Module completed.
-Oh! Shit.

1:09:26.433 --> 1:09:27.602
Oh.

1:09:27.935 --> 1:09:29.403
How are you feeling?

1:09:30.838 --> 1:09:32.305
I feel good.

1:09:33.608 --> 1:09:34.842
Thank you for asking.

1:09:42.182 --> 1:09:43.918
Learning module activated.

1:09:45.987 --> 1:09:48.221
Tomorrow I take him
for a walk and make sure

1:09:48.255 --> 1:09:51.358
he is fit to travel,
then we try to cross.

1:09:52.259 --> 1:09:53.326
Cross?

1:09:54.394 --> 1:09:58.566
He's going to help me
find Patrick. Then we go home.

1:10:08.308 --> 1:10:09.544
Thank you.

1:10:09.577 --> 1:10:10.978
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

1:10:12.714 --> 1:10:14.414
He needs the exercise.

1:10:14.982 --> 1:10:17.952
Imagine if you've been in
a deep sleep for a long time,

1:10:18.686 --> 1:10:20.655
you'll only
get better with time.

1:10:21.622 --> 1:10:27.762
I'm here with you, but
it's like I'm not really here.

1:10:34.736 --> 1:10:35.803
Oh!

1:11:05.533 --> 1:11:09.036
We have to go right now,
they're all watching us.

1:11:10.671 --> 1:11:11.739
I'll be right back.

1:11:37.131 --> 1:11:38.599
Shit!

1:11:55.917 --> 1:11:57.118
What happened to P2?

1:11:57.151 --> 1:11:59.419
I-- I was
looking for you and I--

1:12:51.005 --> 1:12:52.073
There!

1:13:22.770 --> 1:13:24.005
How did your husband die?

1:13:29.744 --> 1:13:30.811
A heart attack.

1:13:32.713 --> 1:13:36.717
Patrick was having
an affair with the CEO's wife.

1:13:38.519 --> 1:13:40.788
I came home early
from a work trip

1:13:41.322 --> 1:13:44.959
and found them screwing on
my grandmother's favorite sofa.

1:13:47.862 --> 1:13:51.532
I told his boss
and before you knew it,

1:13:51.999 --> 1:13:53.734
he was cut from the company.

1:13:56.637 --> 1:14:00.808
His health fell apart
and he didn't care

1:14:00.841 --> 1:14:02.076
about anything anymore.

1:14:05.913 --> 1:14:08.082
He died unexpectedly
of a heart attack,

1:14:08.115 --> 1:14:09.951
but I know
what really killed him.

1:14:13.721 --> 1:14:15.189
Patrick once told me,

1:14:15.589 --> 1:14:18.225
while developing
P2's memory conveyance,

1:14:19.727 --> 1:14:21.494
he believed
he could capture an image

1:14:21.529 --> 1:14:24.497
of his soul
and store it into P2.

1:14:25.433 --> 1:14:27.568
It's the true
breakthrough of the invention

1:14:27.601 --> 1:14:29.469
that Tantalum
knows nothing about.

1:14:31.639 --> 1:14:33.240
And what was
that phone call about?

1:14:34.709 --> 1:14:36.010
They wanna meet me.

1:14:37.611 --> 1:14:38.713
Who's they?

1:14:40.548 --> 1:14:44.752
Amanda. She's
in charge of the recovery.

1:14:44.785 --> 1:14:46.620
I don't think
a meeting is a good idea.

1:14:46.988 --> 1:14:50.091
They can't hurt us,
but I need to know my options.

1:14:51.993 --> 1:14:53.260
They already know we're here.

1:14:55.162 --> 1:14:56.496
Are they coming here?

1:15:00.201 --> 1:15:04.005
If you meet anyone,
if anybody speaks to you,

1:15:04.038 --> 1:15:08.009
don't tell them
anything about me, about P2.

1:15:09.844 --> 1:15:13.180
Don't share anything about
yourself or your personal life.

1:15:17.618 --> 1:15:19.220
When is Amanda coming?

1:15:20.721 --> 1:15:24.258
Amanda's estimated
time of arrival is 19 hours,

1:15:24.592 --> 1:15:26.727
- 35 minutes.
- P2, stop.

1:15:27.962 --> 1:15:32.967
If I don't like what they have
to say, I have one more option.

1:15:36.070 --> 1:15:37.838
It is just a bit risky

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:43.844
but it may be
our only chance to cross.

1:15:49.316 --> 1:15:50.918
I have to get Patrick.

1:15:53.254 --> 1:15:54.722
That's why I'm here.

1:15:55.790 --> 1:15:56.857
How?

1:16:00.061 --> 1:16:02.596
I sold everything
I had to get here...

1:16:04.198 --> 1:16:06.233
and I still
don't think it's enough.

1:16:10.037 --> 1:16:11.705
We all need to leave.

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:14.208
You need to.

1:16:16.644 --> 1:16:17.978
I can get us home.

1:16:18.612 --> 1:16:21.248
-I can help you.
-But why do we have to leave?

1:16:25.419 --> 1:16:27.321
There's nothing here, Elliot.

1:16:36.163 --> 1:16:38.199
I want you to--
I want you to stay.

1:16:38.232 --> 1:16:41.836
I want you
to stay here with me.

1:16:43.904 --> 1:16:44.972
Okay?

1:16:49.076 --> 1:16:50.678
She's gone, Elliot.

1:16:55.216 --> 1:16:56.317
She's not here.

1:16:59.987 --> 1:17:01.088
She's not here.

1:17:01.956 --> 1:17:03.624
Um...

1:18:19.433 --> 1:18:22.169
That's enough.
You should rest your eyes.

1:18:29.043 --> 1:18:31.212
You still smell like chlorine,

1:18:31.245 --> 1:18:32.780
we're gonna
have to wash you up.

1:18:33.113 --> 1:18:34.181
Uh...

1:18:35.349 --> 1:18:37.985
hey, uh, Julie's clothes

1:18:38.018 --> 1:18:39.353
that she left at our place.

1:18:41.055 --> 1:18:43.057
I was gonna
bring everything to her.

1:18:44.425 --> 1:18:45.492
Look at this.

1:18:45.859 --> 1:18:47.127
Uh, what do you think?

1:18:48.530 --> 1:18:49.797
Mm-hmm.

1:18:53.234 --> 1:18:54.802
Huh? Maybe for him.

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.028
Psst.

1:20:01.636 --> 1:20:02.903
Thanks.

1:20:18.586 --> 1:20:20.454
Yours doesn't work either.

1:20:22.089 --> 1:20:23.824
This place makes you crazy.

1:20:28.128 --> 1:20:29.196
Cheers!

1:20:30.297 --> 1:20:31.365
Cheers!

1:22:59.514 --> 1:23:00.582
Patrick?

1:23:06.119 --> 1:23:07.187
P2?

1:23:13.460 --> 1:23:14.995
Yes, Greta.

1:23:15.730 --> 1:23:17.164
Come get in the tub.

1:23:19.099 --> 1:23:20.167
Join me.

1:23:29.611 --> 1:23:31.011
No, no, no, no!

1:23:33.548 --> 1:23:35.683
Take your clothes off first.

1:24:11.385 --> 1:24:12.520
Good.

1:24:15.389 --> 1:24:16.558
Now get in.

1:24:30.805 --> 1:24:32.072
Sit down.

1:24:39.413 --> 1:24:41.516
Right, right.

1:24:43.885 --> 1:24:47.789
Good. Come closer.

1:25:46.614 --> 1:25:48.281
Did you read
the pages I gave you?

1:25:48.315 --> 1:25:49.550
Yes.

1:25:49.917 --> 1:25:51.619
I'm re-provisioning now.

1:25:54.756 --> 1:25:57.257
Tell me what's your name?

1:25:57.859 --> 1:26:01.328
-My model number is 65--
-No.

1:26:05.700 --> 1:26:06.834
- No.
- Patrick.

1:26:11.371 --> 1:26:12.540
But you know that.

1:26:17.310 --> 1:26:18.546
That's right.

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:22.315
I can hear you Patrick.

1:26:31.893 --> 1:26:33.895
What's your favorite place?

1:26:33.928 --> 1:26:36.196
I read everything.

1:26:43.270 --> 1:26:44.471
I remember.

1:26:47.775 --> 1:26:48.943
You remember?

1:26:48.976 --> 1:26:50.678
My favorite place...

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.883
where I proposed to you

1:26:57.885 --> 1:26:59.419
and you said yes

1:27:01.488 --> 1:27:05.626
and my life
was changed forever.

1:27:07.562 --> 1:27:08.629
Yes.

1:27:11.298 --> 1:27:12.667
Remember that hike?

1:27:14.836 --> 1:27:15.937
That morning?

1:27:19.974 --> 1:27:21.408
I remember.

1:27:38.358 --> 1:27:39.827
Thank you, Patrick.

1:27:50.004 --> 1:27:51.706
We can forgive each other.

1:27:55.375 --> 1:27:56.677
I forgive you.

1:27:57.712 --> 1:27:58.913
I am sorry.

1:28:01.082 --> 1:28:03.951
-I forgive you.
-I forgive you.

1:28:40.922 --> 1:28:43.057
I can't wait
to see you, Patrick.

1:28:45.860 --> 1:28:47.360
I'm right here.

1:28:57.905 --> 1:28:59.607
Is there something wrong?

1:29:05.146 --> 1:29:06.581
Please leave.

1:33:40.788 --> 1:33:42.857
We met outside.

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:47.695
We drove here together.

1:33:50.364 --> 1:33:52.199
I am here with you.

1:33:57.104 --> 1:33:58.172
Yeah.

1:34:04.912 --> 1:34:07.982
Do you know
why you are here, Elliot?

1:34:32.740 --> 1:34:34.975
I know you make Greta happy.

1:34:35.009 --> 1:34:39.380
I see her with you
and she's happy, you know?

1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:47.321
So what's the plan?

1:34:49.290 --> 1:34:52.493
Greta says that you're
gonna help her find Patrick.

1:34:52.527 --> 1:34:54.128
Seeing that Patrick is dead,

1:34:54.161 --> 1:34:55.829
she must have
come up with something.

1:34:58.265 --> 1:34:59.833
Tell me about Amanda.

1:35:05.773 --> 1:35:08.442
The employee directory
tells me that Amanda

1:35:08.842 --> 1:35:10.444
-has not yet departed--
-No.

1:35:10.477 --> 1:35:12.746
Tell me about Amanda.

1:35:12.780 --> 1:35:14.248
What is she like?

1:35:14.281 --> 1:35:17.351
Amanda presents
a threat to Greta's security.

1:35:17.918 --> 1:35:21.021
I advised Greta
not to meet with her.

1:35:22.489 --> 1:35:23.924
Why not?

1:35:24.491 --> 1:35:28.295
Greta seeks
to bargain with Amanda

1:35:28.796 --> 1:35:31.765
because she does not know

1:35:31.799 --> 1:35:34.768
if she will be able
to cross without help.

1:35:37.304 --> 1:35:38.772
What does she need to cross?

1:35:39.406 --> 1:35:43.911
There is a payment.
It must be made in gold.

1:36:14.141 --> 1:36:15.209
Elliot...

1:36:18.946 --> 1:36:20.481
do you know why you are here?

1:37:11.932 --> 1:37:14.301
I wanna know where
Amanda's gonna be tomorrow.

1:38:00.013 --> 1:38:01.583
Hello, Greta.

1:38:01.616 --> 1:38:05.052
Remember, I'm here to help you.

1:38:30.678 --> 1:38:33.380
It's quite a stunt you've
pulled to get here, Greta.

1:38:34.014 --> 1:38:36.950
No one from the living
has ever done this before.

1:38:36.984 --> 1:38:39.019
I need you to leave us alone.

1:38:39.587 --> 1:38:40.722
Let us go.

1:38:40.755 --> 1:38:42.657
You've got it all wrong, Greta.

1:38:43.323 --> 1:38:45.593
What you're
doing is a disruption.

1:38:46.493 --> 1:38:49.463
Patrick is home, here.

1:38:51.633 --> 1:38:56.036
He's not a prisoner,
he found his way to us.

1:38:57.137 --> 1:39:01.141
Let him be and I will
let you get back to your world.

1:39:01.543 --> 1:39:05.279
When your time comes,
you can join us.

1:39:11.452 --> 1:39:13.120
You took him too soon.

1:39:15.657 --> 1:39:17.191
He wants to be with me.

1:39:19.794 --> 1:39:21.261
What are you doing here?

1:39:22.463 --> 1:39:23.731
I wanted to meet her.

1:39:24.331 --> 1:39:26.366
- Don't look at her.
- I know.

1:39:33.407 --> 1:39:34.742
Where's P2?

1:39:42.517 --> 1:39:46.019
Return P2 to us
or you will be followed.

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.024
Whatever time you have
left cannot endure eternity.

1:40:04.505 --> 1:40:07.341
Don't you remember me, Elliot?

1:40:31.265 --> 1:40:32.499
Remember?

1:40:33.668 --> 1:40:34.736
Remember?

1:40:40.340 --> 1:40:41.609
Remember?

1:40:44.411 --> 1:40:48.716
Elliot, this is your new home.

1:40:50.117 --> 1:40:51.619
Leave him out of this.

1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:54.822
He's here

1:40:54.856 --> 1:40:56.356
on his own accord.

1:40:58.560 --> 1:40:59.827
Elliot...

1:41:03.798 --> 1:41:05.567
welcome home.

1:41:11.806 --> 1:41:13.841
Don't listen to her.
She's all lies, Elliot.

1:41:15.409 --> 1:41:17.745
If I were to pay you,
how much would it cost?

1:41:20.882 --> 1:41:24.586
Impossible.
You could never have enough.

1:41:25.587 --> 1:41:27.154
How much?

1:41:31.491 --> 1:41:33.360
Just let them leave.

1:41:34.428 --> 1:41:35.495
I can stay.

1:41:37.230 --> 1:41:38.298
Thank you, Elliot.

1:41:38.332 --> 1:41:39.534
No!

1:41:41.468 --> 1:41:43.337
You'll never be able to cross.

1:41:43.938 --> 1:41:46.874
One paltry coin is not
enough for the three of you.

1:41:48.843 --> 1:41:50.344
You'll be stranded.

1:41:55.282 --> 1:41:58.385
Greta, let them rest.

1:42:22.409 --> 1:42:24.912
-P2, we're leaving.
-Okay.

1:42:33.988 --> 1:42:35.389
Elliot, let's go!

1:43:15.930 --> 1:43:16.964
Julie?

1:43:17.699 --> 1:43:19.667
Julie,
where are you calling from?

1:43:21.368 --> 1:43:23.336
Yes, I miss you too.

1:43:24.438 --> 1:43:25.740
It's nice
to hear your voice. Yes.

1:43:26.107 --> 1:43:29.811
I can-- I can do that.
I can do that now.

1:43:30.444 --> 1:43:31.579
Okay.

1:43:31.612 --> 1:43:32.647
- Elliot--
- Yeah, I-- can--

1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:33.815
--don't!
-I have my--

1:43:33.848 --> 1:43:34.916
It's not her.

1:43:34.949 --> 1:43:36.517
It's not her.

1:43:37.618 --> 1:43:39.921
She can't reach you here.
No one can.

1:43:40.320 --> 1:43:42.389
P2 is ready
to make the journey.

1:43:42.422 --> 1:43:44.391
We're gonna have
to get Patrick ourselves.

1:43:45.392 --> 1:43:47.427
Okay. But we have to leave now.

1:43:47.729 --> 1:43:49.429
-If we stay we--
-Okay.

1:43:50.965 --> 1:43:52.633
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:43:52.667 --> 1:43:54.267
-We have to go.
-Okay. Okay.

1:44:01.576 --> 1:44:03.410
Elliot?

1:44:03.878 --> 1:44:06.279
Don't answer the door, Elliot!

1:44:07.615 --> 1:44:09.282
Don't open the door, Elliot!

1:44:09.951 --> 1:44:11.351
Elliot!

1:44:11.384 --> 1:44:12.486
-Elliot?
-Julie?

1:44:12.520 --> 1:44:15.523
Follow me. Follow me.

1:45:46.180 --> 1:45:50.518
Let them rest. Let them rest.

1:51:11.272 --> 1:51:12.940
We made it,
Elliot. We're going through.

1:51:17.512 --> 1:51:21.982
Elliot, don't worry
we'll be home soon.

1:51:27.054 --> 1:51:28.122
Hey?

1:51:29.957 --> 1:51:31.292
- No, no!
- No!

1:51:31.325 --> 1:51:32.393
Stop it!

1:54:05.179 --> 1:54:06.246
She's not here.

1:54:10.084 --> 1:54:11.318
She's not here.
