ISSA DEE: I spent my entire
twenties with a dude

00:03.620 --> 00:04.704

end up with.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.328
I'm breaking up with him
tonight.

00:06.412 --> 00:08.370
-No you're not.
-Yeah, you right, I'm not.

00:08.454 --> 00:09.454
Of course I'm not.

00:10.912 --> 00:11.787
ISSA: I'm 28.

00:12.287 --> 00:14.245
I work in the non-profit world

MOLLY CARTER:
Most of these dudes are not
looking for a relationship.

00:20.328 --> 00:21.996
Her standards are way too high.

00:22.078 --> 00:23.746
Yeah, maybe she should
lower them like I did.

00:23.829 --> 00:24.704
Wait, what the fuck?

00:25.829 --> 00:26.912
Why'd you never give me a shot?

00:26.996 --> 00:29.120
Because you wanted to go
do your thing.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.996
Maybe I wasn't ready then.
What if I'm ready now?

00:36.996 --> 00:38.078
Who's Daniel?

00:38.370 --> 00:39.328

she could've stayed,

11:37.245 --> 11:39.495
she chose your spot.

11:42.412 --> 11:46.620
Look, I just came here
for this guitar.

11:46.704 --> 11:48.537
See y'all later. Mwah.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.912
See you later. Mwah.

11:50.996 --> 11:52.412
So who's gonna
watch Jada?

11:52.495 --> 11:53.912
Issa or Vanessa?

11:56.704 --> 11:59.162
Damn, girl,
I braided your hair
all kinds of wrong.

12:00.537 --> 12:03.245
( beat playing )

12:05.454 --> 12:08.245
( playing along with beat )

12:11.203 --> 12:13.996
( beat continues )

12:22.871 --> 12:25.078
( beat continues )

12:27.245 --> 12:28.746
Daniel:
Niggas, are you ready?

12:28.829 --> 12:30.954
( humming along )

12:33.579 --> 12:34.996
( turns off music )

12:35.078 --> 12:38.162
- I was just, uh...
- You were just...

12:38.245 --> 12:40.954
( laughs )
Nah. I didn't even
look like that.

12:41.037 --> 12:43.162
Someone's been drinkin'.

12:43.245 --> 12:45.328
I was--
I was stuck on something,

12:45.412 --> 12:47.579
and then...
I got unstuck.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.454
Actually, can I have
some of that?

12:51.537 --> 12:52.412
Yeah.

12:56.996 --> 12:58.787
( Daniel humming )

13:01.412 --> 13:03.537
That's been you
playing guitar?

13:03.620 --> 13:06.996
'Cause I noticed
the live instruments
on your track.

13:07.078 --> 13:07.954
( chuckles )

13:09.328 --> 13:11.787
- What?
- Nothin'. I mean...

13:11.871 --> 13:13.829
that's just funny
that you noticed that.

13:13.912 --> 13:17.495
I notice shit.
I'm observant.

13:17.579 --> 13:20.412
( both laugh )

13:20.495 --> 13:22.454
- Oh, you observant?
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.912
Close your eyes.

13:29.495 --> 13:31.996
What color shirt
am I wearing?

13:32.078 --> 13:34.454
Uh, it got stripes?

13:34.537 --> 13:36.746
( both laugh )

13:41.287 --> 13:42.662
Oh, I don't--

13:42.746 --> 13:45.537
I'm sor-- Ah, I don't
think we should do this.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.037
Um...

13:48.120 --> 13:50.370
No, I just think we...

13:50.454 --> 13:52.162
know better?

13:53.871 --> 13:55.579
I'm confused, Issa.

13:55.662 --> 13:57.871
Out of all the places
that you could've stayed,

13:57.954 --> 13:59.120
you stayed with me.

14:00.579 --> 14:03.912
Yeah, I did, but...

14:03.996 --> 14:06.704
- not for this.
- But isn't it always this?

14:06.787 --> 14:09.787
You were just low-key
dropping hints about me
fucking somebody else.

14:09.871 --> 14:11.245
I don't care who you fuck.

14:11.328 --> 14:14.454
I just want a heads-up
so I don't have to be here.

14:16.829 --> 14:18.662
Why are you here?

14:18.746 --> 14:21.162
'Cause I needed
a place to stay.

14:21.245 --> 14:23.579
And you're close to work.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.620
( laughs )

14:29.162 --> 14:32.245
I thought I was staying here
as a friend,

14:32.328 --> 14:34.871
and you know
we always at least had that.

14:36.704 --> 14:38.370
Yeah.

14:46.829 --> 14:48.996
These...

14:49.078 --> 14:50.579
glasses are so heavy.

14:50.662 --> 14:53.120
I'm tired. Is it...
daylight savings time?

14:53.203 --> 14:54.370
Did that happen already?

15:16.495 --> 15:19.328

15:19.412 --> 15:23.996
Mmm. I gotta call
with my new firm.

15:24.078 --> 15:26.662
We're still
negotiating my contract.

15:26.746 --> 15:29.620
Oh. OK,
Boss Molly.

15:29.704 --> 15:31.245
Yep.

15:31.328 --> 15:33.787
You want me
to make breakfast first?

15:33.871 --> 15:35.704
- Ooh, yeah.
- Yeah?

15:35.787 --> 15:37.746
- Mm-mm.
- ( phone buzzing )

15:37.829 --> 15:39.954
Excuse me
one sec.

15:45.954 --> 15:47.203
Hey.

15:48.370 --> 15:50.746
No, I'm still at Molly's.

15:50.829 --> 15:53.454
Yeah. OK.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.704
All right,
I'll call you back.

15:59.412 --> 16:00.662
I can make pancakes.

16:00.746 --> 16:01.620
( sighs )

16:05.454 --> 16:07.287
Listen, um,

16:07.370 --> 16:08.746
we need to decide

16:08.829 --> 16:10.954
whether we're friends
who don't  have sex,

16:11.037 --> 16:13.954
or acquaintances
who just  have sex.

16:14.037 --> 16:16.912
Because anything otherwise,
it's muddy,

16:16.996 --> 16:19.287
and I need boundaries.

16:20.537 --> 16:22.120
OK. All right.

16:23.370 --> 16:25.662
What do you suggest
we do, then?

16:25.746 --> 16:27.704
We fuck.
And that's it.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.287
No phone calls, no dates,
no spending the night,

16:30.370 --> 16:32.287
no fuckin', then trying
to make pancakes.

16:32.370 --> 16:34.454
- But we love pancakes.
- Nigga.

16:35.620 --> 16:39.203
Well...
OK.

16:40.787 --> 16:42.662
Yeah.

16:42.746 --> 16:43.662
That's fine.

16:47.037 --> 16:48.620
Oh, you mean like now.

16:50.829 --> 16:51.787
OK.

17:03.162 --> 17:04.954
I'm so sorry to hear that,

17:05.037 --> 17:08.370
Vice Principal Irving.
Can I ask why?

17:08.454 --> 17:10.746
VP Irving:
We've decided to link up
with a different organization

17:10.829 --> 17:13.037
that we feel better suits
our students.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.912
And you know
your logo's racist, right?

17:14.996 --> 17:16.412
Y'all need to do better.

17:16.495 --> 17:19.245
I'm sorry.
Thank you for your feedback.

17:35.704 --> 17:37.579
Hi, my name is Issa,

17:37.662 --> 17:39.704
and I'm calling
from We Got Y'All.

17:39.787 --> 17:41.328
I'd love to find out

17:41.412 --> 17:43.454
why you're not partnering
with us anymore.

17:43.537 --> 17:45.746
Man:
The brochure
features black kids,

17:45.829 --> 17:47.787
but only one black employee.

17:47.871 --> 17:50.203
That is... me.

17:50.287 --> 17:52.704
Woman:
The curriculum
feels very Eurocentric,

17:52.787 --> 17:54.787
and it isn't at all catered
to our demographics.

17:54.871 --> 17:57.454
Woman 2:
Everyone you brought
to our school was white.

17:57.537 --> 18:00.245
- And mean.
- OK. Thank you.

18:09.704 --> 18:11.412
Issa:
And I'm not trying
to rock the boat,

18:11.495 --> 18:13.495
but I thought
this was something
that you'd want to know.

18:13.579 --> 18:15.662
And where did you get
this information?

18:15.746 --> 18:18.203
I was hearing
a lot of criticism
during our follow-up calls,

18:18.287 --> 18:21.120
and since our list
of canceled partnerships
seemed pretty high,

18:21.203 --> 18:23.412
I thought it might be helpful
to call those schools.

18:23.495 --> 18:25.954
No, Issa, it's not helpful.

18:26.037 --> 18:27.495
If I wanted you
to speak on our behalf,

18:27.579 --> 18:28.996
I would have left you
out in the field.

18:29.078 --> 18:30.704
You keep overstepping
your bounds.

18:30.787 --> 18:33.037
I'm sorry, I thought that--

18:33.120 --> 18:36.120
Have you noticed
that every time
there's an issue here lately,

18:36.203 --> 18:37.954
you're involved?

18:38.037 --> 18:39.871
If you want to be helpful,

18:39.954 --> 18:41.871
get to the root of that.

18:46.454 --> 18:47.579
That's all.

18:49.454 --> 18:52.078
