00:38.705 --> 00:40.540
<i>We want you</i>
<i>to look right into this camera</i>

00:40.623 --> 00:42.542
<i>and talk to the people of Georgia.</i>

00:44.169 --> 00:47.589
<i>So can you tell our fellow Georgians</i>
<i>why they should vote for you?</i>

00:47.672 --> 00:50.050
<i>My family has been in politics</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:53.470
<i>and the power structure</i>
<i>in this town of Hopewell for generations,</i>

00:53.553 --> 00:55.680
<i>and we're not about to concede</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:59.309
<i>to… some man who was born in Atlanta.</i>

01:00.435 --> 01:04.064
<i>Knows nothing about our ways.</i>
<i>How could he? He's not from around here.</i>

01:04.147 --> 01:08.735
<i>He only wants to take from us</i>
<i>good, hardworking taxpayers</i>

01:08.818 --> 01:11.154
<i>and give to the lazy,</i>
<i>good-for-nothing folks</i>

01:11.237 --> 01:13.156
<i>that he thinks are entitled.</i>

01:13.239 --> 01:14.741
<i>What do you say to all the people</i>

01:14.824 --> 01:18.953
<i>that say your views are racist</i>
<i>and hearken back to a Jim Crow South?</i>

01:19.037 --> 01:21.748
<i>Why does everybody</i>
<i>think that white men are racist?</i>

01:22.749 --> 01:26.544
<i>I'm not a racist.</i>
<i>I just don't believe that this is fair.</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:29.172
<i>He got here because of affirmative action.</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:31.883
<i>And if I'm elected to Congress,</i>
<i>it'll be at the top of my agenda</i>

01:31.966 --> 01:33.134
<i>to do away with it.</i>

01:34.886 --> 01:37.305
<i>Another form of welfare is all it is,</i>
<i>if you ask me.</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:40.308
I had just about enough of you,
Mr. White Man.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.270
I'm sorry, sir, but she won't go away.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.521
What does she want?

03:08.605 --> 03:12.358
She won't say.
She's just been sitting there for hours.

03:13.359 --> 03:14.485
Well, I'm busy.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.737
Yessir.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.032
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but you can't just walk--

03:19.115 --> 03:20.617
No, it's all right, Joan.

03:21.993 --> 03:22.869
Thank you.

03:24.996 --> 03:28.416
Something I can do for you, ma'am?
I'm fairly busy.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.253
I want you to look into a murder
that happened here in Hopewell.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.132
-Have you spoken to the Sheriff's Office?
-Ain't for them.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.178
They killed him
right here in this town in 1947.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.600
You want me to look into a murder
that happened over 40 years ago?

03:46.184 --> 03:47.352
I'm sorry. Mrs…

03:48.144 --> 03:49.729
Hattie Mae's my name.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.441
I'm very sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to help you.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.610
Why don't you speak
to the Sheriff's Office?

03:56.694 --> 03:58.988
I never wrote nothing down on the paper.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.283
Life's too long.

04:03.451 --> 04:05.203
He wrote down everything.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.705
Everything you need to know.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.791
-It's right here.

04:30.812 --> 04:32.063
"Leanne Harper"?

04:42.991 --> 04:44.117
<i>"Dear Lil Ann."</i>

04:45.243 --> 04:46.869
<i>"My mama's cousin Winnie got sick,</i>

04:46.953 --> 04:49.205
<i>so she asked me</i>
<i>to take her to Summerville yesterday,</i>

04:49.289 --> 04:51.582
<i>about four hours away</i>
<i>from where we live now."</i>

04:52.458 --> 04:54.711
<i>"Hope you got my letter</i>
<i>about moving to Hopewell County</i>

04:54.794 --> 04:56.129
<i>with a forwarding address."</i>

04:57.422 --> 05:00.466
<i>"You know, as we drove past</i>
<i>my mama's old house,</i>

05:01.050 --> 05:02.427
<i>it's falling apart now,</i>

05:03.344 --> 05:05.763
<i>but it still bring back one good memory."</i>

05:06.514 --> 05:07.807
<i>"When we first met."</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:12.270
<i>"I can still smell</i>
<i>the lavender and the moonshine."</i>

06:13.581 --> 06:14.791
Who that there?

06:15.375 --> 06:19.003
Well, that's Ethel Lee's daughter.
They call her Bucket.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.630
Why do they call her that?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.383
'Cause her mama dumped her here
like an empty bucket

06:23.466 --> 06:24.759
when she ran off North.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.928
She live with her grandpa.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.139
He an evil old thing.

06:31.849 --> 06:35.478
Why am I doing all this work?
That's what I made these boys for.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.564
Well, one of 'em's like me anyway.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.151
Come here, Bayou.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.821
Come play this trumpet.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.658
-Come on.
-Look at him.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.868
Just play it like he showed you, baby.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.538
Come on now.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.541
Yeah!

06:57.166 --> 06:59.252
That's right!

06:59.335 --> 07:03.589
You get to see which one right now.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.765
-Stop it!
-What?

07:14.392 --> 07:15.518
Y'all like that?

07:15.601 --> 07:17.395
No!

07:17.478 --> 07:21.607
I try to teach him,
but I believe the boy a little slow.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.109
You hush that up, Buster.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.987
She always takes
his side.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.113
Come on, Willie.

07:28.030 --> 07:29.449
Yeah, Willie Earl!

07:32.452 --> 07:33.911
Come on, Willie Earl!

07:33.995 --> 07:35.163
Now you watch this.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.915
Yeah. Let's see what you got.

07:46.132 --> 07:48.050
Play that horn, Willie Earl.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.401
Maybe you should have sang it.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.675
What? You can't talk?

08:31.385 --> 08:32.803
You can really sing.

08:32.887 --> 08:33.763
Thank you.

08:34.805 --> 08:35.973
Get it from my mama.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.936
And as I said,
you should have sang that song.

08:41.437 --> 08:43.147
My… my pa don't like my singing.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.857
He want me to play.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.860
Well, maybe playing is not for you.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.407
Horace John Boyd's my name,
but everybody call me Bayou.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.535
Why they call you that?

08:56.285 --> 08:59.413
My pa says my eye's deep as the bayou
from the time I was born.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.374
Let me see your eyes.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.711
Your eyes are normal.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.134
Your daddy don't seem like he know much.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.387
You mind your manners. That's my pa.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.140
I'm sorry, Horace John.

09:18.724 --> 09:20.893
Bayou is what I like to be called, Bucket.

09:22.061 --> 09:25.565
My name is Leanne Jean Harper,
and I prefer to be called by my name.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.360
Don't you ever call me Bucket,
or I'll never speak to you again.

09:32.029 --> 09:33.364
I best be going.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.866
Hey. I… I'm… I'm sorry.
I ain't mean no harm.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.243
Whoa. Whoa.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.869
Damn.

09:47.378 --> 09:50.464
I hope my book
knocked some sense into your head.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.638
-Will I see you again, Lil Ann?
-When you learn how to say my name.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.691
When you feel that baby coming,
you come see me. Don't you wait.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.234
Yes, ma'am. I won't.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.278
I'll be right here. Take care, y'all.

10:16.073 --> 10:18.743
Oh! Well, don't you look nice!

10:18.826 --> 10:20.703
I take it you really like her.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.955
You took-- I mean,
you didn't leave nobody nothing…

10:23.039 --> 10:26.334
-He run. He run fast, you know.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.879
Willie Earl caught supper.

10:31.881 --> 10:32.757
My boy.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.634
He can do it all.

10:41.807 --> 10:42.642
Here.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.227
Go on and skin 'em up.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.941
I'll do it. Go on, Bayou.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.361
Where you going, boy?

10:54.904 --> 10:56.822
Leave him be now. Go on, Bayou.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.783
Where he going?

10:58.866 --> 11:01.118
He gonna ask that gal
if he can take her to the social.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.036
What gal?

11:03.287 --> 11:04.413
Bucket?

11:06.165 --> 11:08.334
She ain't gonna go nowhere with him.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.753
-Hey, Bayou!
-Leave him be now!

11:10.836 --> 11:11.671
Hold on.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.006
Hold on now!

11:16.008 --> 11:17.802
You gonna ask Bucket to the social?

11:17.885 --> 11:20.012
-Her name ain't Bucket. Leave me alone.
-What?

11:20.096 --> 11:23.015
Oh, look at you.
Oh, you a big boy now, huh?

11:23.099 --> 11:25.142
She ain't gonna go with you.
Look at your clothes.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.228
I said, leave me be now.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.189
All right.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.861
Want me to leave you alone?
What the hell are you talking about?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.947
-Get off!
-Why'd anybody like you?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.366
-Willie Earl!
-Ain't nobody gonna like you.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.493
-Okay? Why would anybody like you?
-Willie Earl!

11:42.576 --> 11:44.161
-I told you to leave him alone!
-What?

11:44.245 --> 11:46.997
The boy gotta learn
how to get tough at some point, Hattie.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.458
Buster, go on in the house
and leave him be, I said.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.711
You too, Willie Earl.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.881
Come on, Willie.
I'm gonna teach you a new song.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.050
We'll leave her here with this sorry boy.

11:58.884 --> 11:59.719
Go on.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.555
Come on.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.599
Why him and Daddy treat me like that?

12:06.976 --> 12:08.436
You don't worry about them.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.771
Or nobody else.

12:10.855 --> 12:11.897
You hear me?

12:15.317 --> 12:16.736
You go on over there,

12:17.820 --> 12:18.821
and you ask her.

12:18.904 --> 12:20.823
-Mm-hmm.

12:20.906 --> 12:23.409
Go on now. Hold on.
Let me get this dirt off your back.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.161
She ain't gonna like you!

12:49.935 --> 12:51.270
What you want, boy?

12:52.813 --> 12:53.898
Hello, sir.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.107
Speak up.

12:55.191 --> 12:56.734
Um…

12:56.817 --> 12:58.861
I want-- I wanted to…

13:04.867 --> 13:06.410
My mama's a wash woman, sir,

13:06.494 --> 13:09.663
and I wanted to know
if you had any washing need to be done.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.961
You think I'm stupid, boy?

13:16.045 --> 13:16.921
No.

13:18.672 --> 13:19.924
You after Bucket, ain't ya?

13:20.007 --> 13:20.883
No, sir.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.220
Now, you get on away from around here.

13:25.179 --> 13:27.807
You gets off my land
before I kills you!

13:29.683 --> 13:31.143
Get on around from here!

13:43.197 --> 13:44.615
You've been quiet.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.286
She said yeah?

13:50.621 --> 13:51.622
No.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.213
Why you gotta be so mean to this boy?

14:01.674 --> 14:02.675
It ain't right.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.679
I don't care.

14:07.721 --> 14:09.890
-It ain't right.
-It's all right, Mama.

14:10.474 --> 14:11.809
I can handle myself.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.269
You hear that, Willie Earl?

14:14.728 --> 14:15.938
Now, Bayou,

14:16.772 --> 14:18.816
that's something I'd like to see.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.609
Buster, now you stop it.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.280
I get to say what I want
at my own damn supper table!

14:30.160 --> 14:31.412
Come on, Willie Earl.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.164
Willie gonna finish his supper.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.295
Come on.

14:53.767 --> 14:54.810
Eat your supper.

16:20.854 --> 16:21.981
Did you read the letter?

16:23.649 --> 16:26.318
What? I--

16:28.570 --> 16:30.197
You don't know how to read.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.827
It say, "Meet me at the yew tree."

16:36.996 --> 16:37.913
Come on.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.419
You… you shouldn't be out here.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.921
Your grandpa gonna be mad.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.549
He passes out drunk
every night about this time.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.011
But if you want, I can go.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.596
I… I don't want you to do that.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.390
Why you come, then?

17:00.394 --> 17:02.104
I came to ask you to the social.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.693
That's nice, but… he won't let me do that.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.571
He won't let me be around nobody.

17:10.654 --> 17:11.613
Why come?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.408
He just mean.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.703
It's like he hates me.

17:19.538 --> 17:20.372
Yeah.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.875
I know the feeling.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.884
I don't even know why I came to see you.

17:34.094 --> 17:35.596
I know it ain't proper.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.600
I hope you don't think bad of me.

17:39.683 --> 17:41.477
No… no, I'm glad you did.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.438
-Promise me you won't tell nobody.
-No, I won't.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.939
He would kill me if he knew.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.275
I won't. I won't.

17:50.736 --> 17:51.820
How old are you?

17:52.446 --> 17:53.530
Seventeen.

17:54.865 --> 17:55.699
I'm 16.

17:56.575 --> 17:58.243
Why you don't know how to read?

17:59.870 --> 18:02.039
Well, my pa and my brother say
I'm too slow to learn.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.874
Don't you listen to that. You can.

18:04.374 --> 18:07.169
<i>You looked so beautiful</i>
<i>in that night light.</i>

18:07.252 --> 18:08.128
I'll show you.

18:08.212 --> 18:11.173
<i>Ain't never known nobody</i>
<i>to encourage me but my mama.</i>

18:11.799 --> 18:13.842
<i>And she ain't make me feel like you did.</i>

18:13.926 --> 18:15.010
Thank you.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.472
<i>That first night we stood there</i>
<i>at that tree for hours, just talking,</i>

18:18.555 --> 18:19.932
<i>almost till the sun come up.</i>

18:20.015 --> 18:21.475
I sure appreciate it.

18:21.558 --> 18:23.393
<i>And every night after that,</i>

18:24.019 --> 18:27.397
<i>I couldn't wait for that airplane</i>
<i>to come through my window.</i>

19:13.986 --> 19:16.530
<i>It was so innocent, so pure.</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:17.573
It were…

19:18.157 --> 19:20.033
<i>We did something</i>
<i>we both needed real bad.</i>

19:21.326 --> 19:24.163
<i>-We laughed. We laughed a lot.</i>

19:24.788 --> 19:25.831
Sound it out!

19:26.373 --> 19:28.876
<i>And you bought a book,</i>
<i>and you taught me to read.</i>

19:28.959 --> 19:32.171
-"It was a long hot summer."
-That's right! That's right!

19:32.796 --> 19:34.923
<i>Mama wondered</i>
<i>what was wrong with me.</i>

19:35.424 --> 19:38.969
<i>But she was so happy that I was reading,</i>
<i>she ain't ask much.</i>

19:39.052 --> 19:42.848
<i>Couldn't tell her. She'd be mad</i>
<i>that I was sneaking out the house at night</i>

19:42.931 --> 19:45.225
<i>and because you asked me</i>
<i>not to tell nobody.</i>

19:45.309 --> 19:47.769
<i>But I sure wanted the world to know.</i>

19:48.770 --> 19:50.772
<i>But I didn't understand the shaking.</i>

19:50.856 --> 19:53.859
<i>Always felt like</i>
<i>there was so much you wanted to say,</i>

19:53.942 --> 19:56.737
<i>but for some reason… you never did.</i>

19:57.404 --> 19:59.281
<i>You'd just shake like a leaf in the wind.</i>

19:59.990 --> 20:01.283
All right. If you look here…

20:01.366 --> 20:04.870
<i>Sometimes I thought,</i>
<i>even on a hot night, you would just shake.</i>

20:04.953 --> 20:05.829
You all right?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.290
<i>Like your soul</i>
<i>was trying to shake something out.</i>

20:14.880 --> 20:16.882
<i>All summer long we met in that tree.</i>

20:18.217 --> 20:21.511
<i>I was worried about what would happen</i>
<i>when the season rains come.</i>

20:24.348 --> 20:25.724
<i>But you know what?</i>

20:27.226 --> 20:28.518
<i>There you were.</i>

20:31.271 --> 20:33.190
<i>I thought you was crazy, gal.</i>

20:35.025 --> 20:38.904
<i>Truth is… we was both starting</i>
<i>be crazy about each other.</i>

20:40.530 --> 20:42.449
<i>Like we know what was being said,</i>

20:43.492 --> 20:45.160
<i>and we wasn't even talking.</i>

20:54.378 --> 20:56.088
Can you stay a little longer?

20:59.675 --> 21:00.509
Um…

21:01.593 --> 21:03.345
My mama will be getting up soon.

21:06.765 --> 21:07.641
Okay.

21:19.486 --> 21:21.321
<i>And that was our first kiss.</i>

21:23.615 --> 21:26.451
<i>Ain't nothing felt that good</i>
<i>in all my life.</i>

21:28.787 --> 21:32.457
<i> I walked home floating,</i>
<i>like my feet didn't even touch the ground.</i>

21:32.541 --> 21:33.875
<i>But that ain't last long.</i>

21:33.959 --> 21:35.168
Come on!

21:35.252 --> 21:36.712
-Just come here.
-Get away from me!

21:36.795 --> 21:38.463
I said come here.

21:38.547 --> 21:41.758
You put your hands on me again,
I swear, I'll kill you dead.

21:41.842 --> 21:43.635
Where you been, boy? Come here.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.389
You touch him,
I'll meet your soul at the gates of hell.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.975
You ain't shit.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.270
Just like your black ass daddy.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.688
Buster…

21:55.272 --> 21:56.356
Willie Earl,

21:56.440 --> 21:57.983
that's my boy.

21:58.066 --> 22:00.152
He make me proud.

22:00.235 --> 22:01.903
Get on out of here, now.

22:02.446 --> 22:05.449
I'm gonna go on up to Chicago. Hmm?

22:06.033 --> 22:08.201
And… and I'mma play

22:08.744 --> 22:11.204
at the Capitol Royale.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.206
You all gonna see.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.339
This is my money, Buster.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.925
-You ain't taking it. You ain't, Buster.
-My money too. No!

22:24.009 --> 22:26.094
How else am I supposed to get there?

22:26.178 --> 22:28.889
Buster, that's all we got.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.856
Hey, Daddy, Daddy.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.358
Dad, I wanna go with you.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.028
No, son.

22:43.111 --> 22:46.573
The road ain't--
It ain't the place for you.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.784
-You's too young.
-No, Daddy, please!

22:54.539 --> 22:55.999
Willie Earl, come here.

22:58.627 --> 23:01.546
-It's your fault. It's your fault too!
-Willie Earl, stop it.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.090
He told me!

23:03.173 --> 23:05.425
I will slap the taste out your mouth.

23:17.687 --> 23:18.730
Where you been?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.318
My daddy walked out on us.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.196
I'm sorry, Bayou.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.197
That's all right.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.866
It's for the best, I guess.

23:31.451 --> 23:34.162
I'm gonna have to help my mama
with more of her washing.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.790
And she'll be up late doing it.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.459
You can't come here no more.

23:39.543 --> 23:40.585
No, I… I can.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.631
I can. I'mma just be late. That's all.

23:45.632 --> 23:46.883
You look sad.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.553
Don't be.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.974
I need you to be happy
because we can't be sad together.

23:54.057 --> 23:54.975
You hear me?

23:57.561 --> 23:58.395
Yeah.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.944
<i>Every gal in town</i>
<i>looked at me and laughed</i>

24:48.028 --> 24:50.655
<i>'cause of what my brother</i>
<i>had said to them about me.</i>

24:52.449 --> 24:53.366
<i>Not you.</i>

24:55.744 --> 24:57.454
<i>You made me feel like a man.</i>

24:59.915 --> 25:01.458
<i>You made me feel good.</i>

25:03.502 --> 25:04.669
<i>You made me…</i>

25:04.753 --> 25:06.129
I'm in love with you.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.430
I best be going.

25:16.181 --> 25:17.015
But--

25:17.933 --> 25:19.309
-Lil Ann…
-No, no, I…

25:21.228 --> 25:22.103
I gotta go.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.237
<i>I hated that night.</i>

25:32.197 --> 25:33.365
<i>I was so confused.</i>

25:35.617 --> 25:37.953
<i>Maybe I shouldn't have told you</i>
<i>I loved you.</i>

25:38.453 --> 25:39.371
W--

25:40.288 --> 25:43.208
Boy! Boy, you done lost your mind.

25:43.291 --> 25:44.459
Mama, I'm leaving.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.712
I'm leaving. You don't need me here.

25:47.796 --> 25:50.131
Here, that's my dream.
But you got this nothing.

25:50.215 --> 25:52.259
-He can help you.
-Don't you call him that!

25:52.342 --> 25:54.594
I'm 19 now, Mama. You can't stop me.

25:54.678 --> 25:58.181
I'mma going to Chicago. I'mma find Daddy.
I'mma play in the band with him.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.432
Willie Earl!

26:00.433 --> 26:03.019
He don't know nothing about Chicago!

26:03.103 --> 26:04.187
Let him go, Mama.

26:04.729 --> 26:06.231
<i>My mama cried all night.</i>

26:06.314 --> 26:07.732
Come on, come on in the house.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.860
<i>I'd have given anything</i>
<i>to not see her sad.</i>

26:11.653 --> 26:14.906
<i>Every night, I waited for her</i>
<i>to cry herself to sleep.</i>

26:16.074 --> 26:18.535
<i>And I lay there waiting</i>
<i>for a paper airplane…</i>

26:20.620 --> 26:22.539
<i>…or waiting at that tree for you.</i>

26:22.622 --> 26:25.458
<i>We went from talking every night,</i>
<i>all summer long,</i>

26:26.251 --> 26:27.752
<i>to you not coming at all.</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:30.005
<i>I got so worried.</i>

26:31.506 --> 26:33.675
<i>So I went to your house that night.</i>

26:35.468 --> 26:38.305
No. No!

26:38.388 --> 26:40.807
<i>I never told you, but I saw it.</i>

26:43.310 --> 26:46.104
<i>I hated every day</i>
<i>I didn't come in there and kill him.</i>

26:47.147 --> 26:50.609
<i>What kind of…</i>
<i>What kind of man I'm is that I didn't.</i>

26:52.319 --> 26:54.154
<i>Maybe my brother and daddy're right.</i>

26:55.572 --> 26:56.906
<i>Maybe I am weak.</i>

27:33.234 --> 27:35.111
Such a beautiful letter.

27:36.863 --> 27:38.239
I'm so glad to see you.

27:38.740 --> 27:39.908
You all right?

27:42.786 --> 27:46.164
Maybe I shouldn't have told you
that I love you, but I do.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.291
That's how I feel.

27:49.209 --> 27:52.087
-But if you stop coming to see me--
-No, it ain't that. I…

27:56.341 --> 27:57.676
I love you too.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.723
Then marry me.

28:05.392 --> 28:06.267
I'm…

28:09.688 --> 28:12.065
I'm not a pure girl.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.818
I don't care. I love you.

28:16.861 --> 28:17.946
I love you.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.322
We can run away.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.033
Anywhere. We'll be all right.

28:23.660 --> 28:24.577
Just marry me.

28:24.661 --> 28:26.454
-He won't let me.
-Hey.

28:26.538 --> 28:28.415
-He won't let me.
-Hey, hey.

28:28.498 --> 28:29.791
I'll deal with him.

28:31.126 --> 28:32.502
You just say, "Yeah."

28:35.213 --> 28:38.258
-Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:38.341 --> 28:39.551
-Yeah?

28:44.514 --> 28:45.557
Yeah!

28:49.185 --> 28:51.229
Ain't nothing holding you here.

28:52.605 --> 28:53.982
You should move to Hopewell County.

28:54.065 --> 28:56.276
It's where all the business is
for colored folk.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.778
You could open you up a proper juke joint.

28:58.862 --> 28:59.738
Citsy.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.698
What's keeping you here, huh?

29:02.824 --> 29:05.660
Buster gone, and Willie Earl gone.

29:06.327 --> 29:08.455
I'm moving over there too.

29:09.414 --> 29:12.876
My cousin said she might be able
to give me a job. I'm going.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.588
I don't know.

29:16.671 --> 29:20.300
It ain't big like Atlanta.
I know you don't like the big city.

29:20.383 --> 29:22.635
I'm telling you, you gonna like it.

29:23.803 --> 29:26.347
You should come too. Tell her, Bayou.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.683
Come on!

29:28.767 --> 29:31.853
-How far away that is from here?
-About four hours by train.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.397
-Uh, Hopewell County<i>,</i> you say?
-Yeah.

29:35.231 --> 29:37.734
Yeah, the Negroes are doing
so good over there.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.446
-Come on.
-Maybe we should leave, Mama.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.031
You want to leave here?

29:45.617 --> 29:48.828
Yeah, well, yeah.
I wanted to tell you something.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.874
-Me and Leanne been courting for a while.
-Bucket?

29:52.957 --> 29:54.793
No, don't… don't call her that.

29:55.293 --> 29:56.836
I knew something was going on.

29:57.545 --> 29:59.172
-You sneak out of here at night.

30:00.757 --> 30:02.467
You know?

30:02.550 --> 30:03.510
Yeah.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.178
Just didn't know it was her.

30:06.638 --> 30:10.809
Yeah, well, I asked her to marry me,
and her grandpa say no.

30:11.684 --> 30:15.522
But he a bad man,
and I want to get her, take her with us.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.065
Baby, Bucket leaving.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.193
-Say what?
-They leaving now.

30:20.276 --> 30:23.279
They tell me Ethel's here
to take her up north with her.

30:25.490 --> 30:26.699
Bayou!

30:27.992 --> 30:30.411
-Now why you tell him that?
-He done missed her.

30:30.912 --> 30:32.580
I'm sure they'd gone by now.

30:33.206 --> 30:36.459
Leanne, don't go. Don't go.

30:36.543 --> 30:39.337
Please. No. Don't, don't.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.047
My father told me what you did to her.

30:41.130 --> 30:43.091
You better thank heavens
I'm not calling the sheriff.

30:43.174 --> 30:46.094
-Get out of here, and you leave her alone.
-Don't…

30:46.177 --> 30:48.304
-Get in the car right now.
-Leanne, don't.

30:48.388 --> 30:49.639
-Now!
-Don't go.

30:49.722 --> 30:51.391
-I have to.
-Don't go, Leanne.

30:51.474 --> 30:52.433
-I love you.
-Get out!

30:52.517 --> 30:55.186
I love you.
Leanne, I love you. Don't go.

30:55.270 --> 30:57.355
-I'm sorry.
-Don't go, don't go.

30:57.438 --> 30:58.940
Don't you-- I love you.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.693
-I'm sorry.
-Please don't go. Come on, don't go!

31:02.235 --> 31:04.821
-Come on, Leanne. Get out the car. Don't--

31:04.904 --> 31:08.283
Leanne, don't go!
Don't… don't go! Don't go!

31:08.366 --> 31:10.118
Leanne, don't go. Don't--

31:10.201 --> 31:13.162
I told you
to leave her alone, didn't I?

31:24.549 --> 31:25.800
<i>"Dear Leanne."</i>

31:26.759 --> 31:28.887
<i>"Been writing to you</i>
<i>every day for a year now."</i>

31:28.970 --> 31:30.889
Left, right, left. Left…

31:30.972 --> 31:34.559
<i>"Been sending letters to everybody</i>

Yes, ma'am?

32:03.630 --> 32:04.797
Would you…

32:04.881 --> 32:07.175
…be so kind as to return this to sender?

32:07.258 --> 32:08.092
I sure will.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.678
Also, return any more

32:10.762 --> 32:12.347
-Yes, ma'am.
-Thank you kindly.

32:57.684 --> 33:00.478
-So good to see you.

33:00.561 --> 33:02.814
Easy. Watch my leg now.

33:02.897 --> 33:05.441
<i>My mama never ceased to amaze me.</i>

33:06.234 --> 33:08.444
<i>She opened a real juke joint.</i>

33:09.946 --> 33:13.032
<i>When I tell you, seemed like</i>
<i>all the colored folk in the county</i>

33:13.116 --> 33:14.659
<i>came near every weekend.</i>

33:15.451 --> 33:17.662
<i>I sure wish you could see</i>
<i>how good she doing.</i>

33:18.663 --> 33:21.624
<i>She doing washing in the morning,</i>
<i>that I help her with.</i>

33:21.708 --> 33:23.334
<i>She birth a baby here and there.</i>

33:24.210 --> 33:28.131
<i>And she sang the blues all night long.</i>

33:28.214 --> 33:29.549
Oh, no, no, no.

33:36.723 --> 33:37.724
Yeah, girl!

33:41.811 --> 33:42.812
Yeah!

35:10.900 --> 35:13.277
-My boy!

36:04.412 --> 36:05.538
Y'all all right?

36:05.621 --> 36:07.957
My boy here!

36:09.876 --> 36:12.712
<i>My brother come back</i>
<i>with all his big-time stories as usual.</i>

36:12.795 --> 36:15.381
<i>-So much like my daddy.</i>

36:16.549 --> 36:18.634
<i>Couldn't tell</i>
<i>what was the lie from the truth.</i>

36:18.718 --> 36:20.219
…who the best ones is out there.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.637
<i> Heard my daddy died up there.</i>

36:21.721 --> 36:24.056
Don't say Willie Earl<i>.</i>
I ain't all the way up there.

36:24.140 --> 36:25.474
<i>Willie Earl ain't mention it.</i>

36:25.558 --> 36:27.435
Oh. This is Ira.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.313
He's my manager.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.106
Yeah.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.567
Ira from Europe.

36:35.735 --> 36:37.612
He been to Paris and London.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.405
Yeah.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.910
Why are you so fidgety?

36:49.457 --> 36:51.375
I'm just happy to see my mama. That's all.

36:52.501 --> 36:54.420
-Hmm.
-That's all. That's all.

36:55.588 --> 36:56.714
I'll be right back.

36:56.797 --> 36:57.757
I need water.

36:59.091 --> 37:02.261
-What you doing?

37:02.887 --> 37:05.223
No, I'm fine. Just--

37:05.306 --> 37:06.849
He still write to Bucket?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.770
Got a stack of them at my house.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.522
-And all the gal that come through here?
-Hmm.

37:20.029 --> 37:21.113
You hungry?

37:23.616 --> 37:24.909
-Oh!

37:28.913 --> 37:31.999
Who that man
and where you find him? Don't lie to me.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.751
I ain't finna lie.

37:36.629 --> 37:38.589
He's a big-time manager
out there in Europe.

37:38.673 --> 37:41.217
I met him in Chicago… a few years back.

37:41.717 --> 37:45.054
He said… he said he wanted me
to come play in Europe.

37:45.137 --> 37:47.473
Now, I lost touch with him for a while.

37:48.641 --> 37:51.769
Till one day, he showed up
out of nowhere looking bad.

37:52.270 --> 37:55.189
He said he will return the favor
if I help him get better.

37:55.273 --> 37:56.816
So I brung him down here to you.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.734
-What's wrong with him?
-Hell if I know.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.113
Come on, Mama,
everybody come to you when they sick

38:02.196 --> 38:04.115
or having a baby. I know you can help him.

38:04.198 --> 38:06.075
-I don't like it, I tell you.
-Just help him!

38:08.119 --> 38:09.662
Where this one going, Mama?

38:10.621 --> 38:12.206
That big sack.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.791
Go down to the Clayton Place.

38:13.874 --> 38:16.794
Big white house off 22. You can't miss it.
Citsy just started working there.

38:16.877 --> 38:18.796
-She'll be around back.
-All right now.

38:20.339 --> 38:22.842
If that man die here,
we gonna be in a world of trouble.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.385
You just make sure he don't.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.764
-Hey, Bayou.
-Hey.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.976
Glad you're here. Set it down there.
I made you some lemonade.

38:33.394 --> 38:34.770
Come on, sit a spell.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.066
I ain't knowed you
to do this kind of work.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.485
Oh, well,
the sheriff here's named Jackson.

38:41.569 --> 38:44.113
He asked me to look after
his… baby brother

38:44.196 --> 38:47.241
'cause he coming back home.
So I said, "Okay," and here I am.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.660
-Mm.
-And Jackson nice to me so…

38:50.244 --> 38:51.120
Citsy?

38:51.203 --> 38:52.955
Yes, sir, Sheriff Jackson.

38:53.039 --> 38:54.415
Get up from there.

38:54.498 --> 38:56.584
We don't allow colored
to sit at the table.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.837
Oh, I'm sorry, Sheriff Jackson.
He brung the wash, and I made him sit.

38:59.920 --> 39:02.631
Get up and get out of here.
My brother's here.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.593
This is my brother John
and his beautiful wife…

39:05.676 --> 39:07.511
-Leanne.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.723
This is Citsy. I asked her
to get this place ready for you.

39:10.806 --> 39:13.934
Well, Sheriff Jackson said
you had a long drive.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.436
Can I get you something?

39:15.519 --> 39:18.481
This house is beautiful.

39:18.564 --> 39:20.566
It's been sitting empty
since my father died.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.068
He left it to John here.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.112
-Left me most of the money though.
-Well, it's lovely.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.655
Get on out of here, boy.

39:26.739 --> 39:28.741
-Yessir. Sorry, sir.

39:28.824 --> 39:31.452
What is wrong
with the Negroes down here?

39:32.828 --> 39:35.414
Oh, we keep them in line.

39:35.498 --> 39:38.417
Come on.
I'll show you where you'll be staying

39:38.501 --> 39:40.669
since you're the sweetest mother-in-law
on this side of heaven.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.632
You all right, darling?
You're white as a ghost.

39:44.715 --> 39:47.843
Oh, she's fine.
Maybe tired from the drive.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.679
Your brother drives
like a madman.

39:50.763 --> 39:52.765
Can I get you something, ma'am?

39:53.265 --> 39:55.810
No. No, thank you.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.353
Shall we?

39:57.436 --> 39:58.396
Come on.

39:59.772 --> 40:02.233
We go this way past it.

40:03.776 --> 40:06.195
I need some milk
and some more castor oil for him.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.280
Go in that box,
get a pen and write this down for me.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.953
Who are all these letter for?

40:14.036 --> 40:15.955
Bayou writing to this girl.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.249
What girl? Bucket?

40:18.874 --> 40:20.751
-Yeah.

40:20.835 --> 40:22.169
That fool's still writing her

40:22.253 --> 40:24.463
after all of these
been returned to sender?

40:24.547 --> 40:26.924
Put flour on that paper.
And sugar.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.263
-You get it all done before the rain come?
-Yep.

40:34.056 --> 40:38.436
-"Dear Lil Ann. I love you so much."
-Give me that.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.854
-"I miss you."
-Give me that.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.398
-"Will you write me soon?"
-Give me that, you son of a bitch!

40:42.481 --> 40:44.024
-That's mine!
-"Please." Okay.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.277
-I'm joking around.
-Give me all of 'em!

40:50.281 --> 40:52.199
Come on, Willie Earl.
Take me to the store.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.118
I need to check my mail
and get a few things.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.202
Why Bayou can't do it?

40:55.286 --> 40:56.996
He been helping me all day.
Come on.

40:57.079 --> 41:00.124
And do you know what to do
with that sick man in there? Bayou do.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.208
Now come on.

41:02.668 --> 41:03.752
We'll be back.

41:17.391 --> 41:18.684
I can't do this.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.228
What do you mean?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.605
We are in the South.

41:22.688 --> 41:25.816
Just a few hours
from where we were both born.

41:26.400 --> 41:28.486
-Someone will recognize us.

41:29.236 --> 41:31.906
-No, they won't. Look at us.
-They will. They will.

41:33.157 --> 41:34.742
So what do you propose we do?

41:34.825 --> 41:36.494
-Go back to Boston?
-Yeah.

41:36.577 --> 41:37.995
With nothing?

41:39.622 --> 41:41.582
That man left me with nothing.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.334
So you sure came

41:44.418 --> 41:47.546
and made me your cash cow, didn't you?

41:49.965 --> 41:52.051
Don't you dare talk to me that way.

41:52.843 --> 41:54.595
After all I've done for you.

41:56.305 --> 41:59.767
Now you get yourself together, girl.
This family is well-off.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.230
I saw Bayou.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.484
That washerwoman's boy?

42:09.276 --> 42:10.110
Where?

42:10.694 --> 42:12.196
When we were driving.

42:14.365 --> 42:15.824
I think it was him.

42:21.789 --> 42:23.457
You're imagining things.

42:28.003 --> 42:28.879
Come on.

42:43.143 --> 42:45.396
-Hey, whoa.

42:46.146 --> 42:47.940
Whoa. Hey now.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.405
-Huh?

42:54.488 --> 42:55.864
Where am I?

42:55.948 --> 42:57.783
At Mama's house.

42:58.826 --> 43:00.869
Oh.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.874
Whoa, whoa.
You… you should lay down. You ain't well.

43:05.958 --> 43:08.502
No, I… I am fine.

43:09.169 --> 43:10.713
I am fine. I am alive.

43:11.255 --> 43:12.923
-Yeah.

43:13.924 --> 43:15.426
Here, here, drink this.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.928
It'll make you feel better.

43:21.348 --> 43:22.433
All right now.

43:24.476 --> 43:25.936
Where… where is your brother?

43:26.437 --> 43:28.063
He went to town with Mama.

43:30.399 --> 43:32.359
You should… you should eat something.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.028
I'll be right back.

43:35.988 --> 43:38.907
Leanne, that is a lovely dress.

43:38.991 --> 43:39.992
Thank you.

43:40.075 --> 43:43.579
You better be glad my brother here
is gonna be the new mayor in this town,

43:43.662 --> 43:46.540
so he can afford to keep you
in those nice dresses.

43:46.624 --> 43:49.126
Oh, Jackson, stop bragging on your family.

43:49.209 --> 43:51.795
She and her mother
have only been here for a few hours,

43:51.879 --> 43:53.714
and she already knows you're the sheriff

43:53.797 --> 43:56.050
and your father was the mayor
till he died.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.427
And John here will be the next mayor.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.097
I do declare, Leanne, be grateful
you didn't grow up in this town.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.682
These boys were a terror.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.518
-Were they now?
-Oh, absolutely.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.688
Especially my Jackson.
He stayed in trouble.

44:09.772 --> 44:12.441
Yeah, well, I got the trouble gene,

44:12.524 --> 44:15.277
and my brother here
got the book smarts gene.

44:16.195 --> 44:17.655
I'm proud of you, little brother.

44:18.947 --> 44:21.909
I wish Mama and Daddy
had lived long enough to see you marry.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.119
I know they would have been proud.

44:25.204 --> 44:28.540
Proud of everything except you two eloping
up there in Yankeetown.

44:28.624 --> 44:32.336
Well, Leanne insisted
she didn't want a big spectacle.

44:32.419 --> 44:34.838
Why not?
It should have been in all the papers.

44:34.922 --> 44:37.758
Well, all she wanted was him.
Right, Leanne?

44:38.342 --> 44:39.885
How did you two meet?

44:39.968 --> 44:42.304
Oh, at college.

44:42.388 --> 44:44.515
I was working in the library.

44:44.598 --> 44:47.101
It was love at first sight if you ask me.

44:47.184 --> 44:50.604
I remember the first time she came home
to tell me about him.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.231
I knew he was the one.

44:52.314 --> 44:53.732
I knew it.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.943
And they've been married
three months now.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.486
I'd like to make a toast.

44:57.986 --> 44:59.196
To your parents

44:59.822 --> 45:02.366
and my George. May they rest in peace.

45:03.492 --> 45:04.576
Hear, hear!

45:06.161 --> 45:07.496
Mm-hmm.

45:13.919 --> 45:14.753
Hmm.

45:17.131 --> 45:20.300
Hmm, it's very good. Very good. Very good.

45:20.843 --> 45:25.764
Hey, what day… is it?
I need to make a telephone call.

45:26.265 --> 45:29.435
Oh, well, ain't no telephone around here.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.103
Can you take me to one?

45:31.812 --> 45:32.938
The store closed.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.735
Willie Earl can take you tomorrow,
but, you know, you ain't well, though.

45:37.818 --> 45:40.320
No. I promised your brother
I would get him booked

45:40.404 --> 45:43.198
into the Capitol Royale in Chicago. That…

45:46.076 --> 45:48.203
I need to call them
to see if there is an opening.

45:48.287 --> 45:49.955
Yeah, you can't do that now, so…

45:51.457 --> 45:52.583
Eat your soup.

46:19.401 --> 46:22.112
You told me you had connections.
You said that if I helped you,

46:22.196 --> 46:24.239
you'd help me get into the Capitol Royale.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.492
You know how many colored stars
that place done make?

46:26.575 --> 46:29.077
I will get you in.
I will call him tomorrow,

46:29.161 --> 46:32.247
but I think they need something different.

46:32.331 --> 46:34.833
-Something special.
-No, I'm all the different they need.

46:34.917 --> 46:36.794
Bayou! Come sing with me.

46:37.377 --> 46:38.337
All right.

46:38.921 --> 46:39.755
Come on, baby.

48:01.920 --> 48:03.714
How things going, Hattie?

48:04.631 --> 48:05.549
They fine.

48:07.342 --> 48:09.219
Nobody's bothering you, right?

48:10.470 --> 48:11.805
Nobody at all, Sheriff.

48:12.306 --> 48:14.349
Well, I'll keep it that way.

48:14.975 --> 48:16.935
You just keep this money coming.

48:17.728 --> 48:18.604
Yessir.

49:13.867 --> 49:14.743
Bayou.

49:19.498 --> 49:20.374
Get in.

49:22.960 --> 49:24.962
Anybody see me in that car, I'm dead.

49:25.045 --> 49:27.839
You ain't from around here.
You shouldn't be in this part of town.

49:27.923 --> 49:30.050
-It's for coloreds.
-Bayou, please?

49:31.301 --> 49:32.260
Please.

49:39.893 --> 49:41.269
There's an old mill up the road.

49:41.895 --> 49:42.896
<i>Park behind it.</i>

49:43.730 --> 49:45.565
<i>Turn your lights off when you get there.</i>

50:09.673 --> 50:10.966
How have you been?

50:15.053 --> 50:16.179
Now, Miss Leanne,

50:17.347 --> 50:20.517
you know it ain't right for no white woman
to care how some darkie's doing.

50:22.894 --> 50:24.980
-You do think you're white, don't you?
-Let me explain.

50:25.063 --> 50:28.275
Yeah, I was saving enough money
to go to Boston to look for you.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.945
Thought you had got yourself
in some kind of trouble.

50:32.696 --> 50:34.948
-I'm fit to be tied with you.
-I sent you letters.

50:35.032 --> 50:36.700
I never got no letter from you.

50:38.493 --> 50:39.911
But I wrote you every week.

50:40.579 --> 50:41.997
Anybody with your last name.

50:42.497 --> 50:45.250
-Sometimes five times a week.
-I never got 'em.

50:47.210 --> 50:50.756
I thought you moved on
and married some girl.

50:51.631 --> 50:54.259
How could I do that
when my heart only beat for you?

50:56.595 --> 50:58.263
Why didn't you leave with me?

50:59.097 --> 51:00.182
My mother.

51:02.934 --> 51:06.396
She told me she would go to the sheriff
and tell him you did things to me

51:06.480 --> 51:09.858
if I didn't leave with her
and never talk to you again.

51:10.692 --> 51:14.404
They were gonna kill you
and burn down your mother's house.

51:15.280 --> 51:18.158
She would do it. I know she would.

51:19.451 --> 51:20.744
What was I to do?

51:22.788 --> 51:24.164
I didn't want you hurt.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.125
You have to leave here.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.170
If they know,
they'll kill you and your mama.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.379
I told her that.

51:31.463 --> 51:33.590
She said she rather die here
in that big house

51:33.673 --> 51:35.675
than poor and destitute in Boston.

51:36.176 --> 51:38.136
And she wanted me to marry

51:38.220 --> 51:41.056
a rich… white man.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.605
I don't even know
how I got into this. I just…

51:49.106 --> 51:50.357
I just want out.

51:51.942 --> 51:53.485
I was 17.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.737
You love him?

52:03.203 --> 52:04.037
Do you?

52:06.498 --> 52:09.167
Not… like I love you.

52:09.793 --> 52:10.919
That ain't a no.

52:13.046 --> 52:15.507
He doesn't make me feel the way you do.

52:17.551 --> 52:20.095
Since we've been here,
he's been different.

52:20.887 --> 52:23.473
-He's been mean--
-Yeah. I… I… I don't know you.

52:24.474 --> 52:26.685
The gal I loved only had eyes for me.

52:26.768 --> 52:29.646
-What… what'd you come down here for?
-Don't do this.

52:29.729 --> 52:32.399
-You know this is hard for me.
-How you think I feel?

52:32.983 --> 52:35.777
Seeing you up there
with that son of a bitch hugging you. Huh?

52:37.279 --> 52:40.073
That's Citsy coming to get me.
She gonna go up and come back down,

52:40.157 --> 52:42.159
know I ain't there.
I got to go. I got to go.

52:42.242 --> 52:44.035
Citsy? My Citsy?

52:44.119 --> 52:46.204
You're starting to sound like one of 'em.

52:55.589 --> 52:57.632
Whoa now.

52:58.258 --> 52:59.843
Whoa, whoa. Come on. Come on.

53:02.220 --> 53:04.431
Stop the car, Citsy. Come on now.

53:04.514 --> 53:05.348
Hey.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.686
-You drive.
-Huh?

53:09.769 --> 53:12.606
Make me?
Get off of me, gal. Get off of me.

53:12.689 --> 53:15.192
Man, just come on now.
Get off of me and get in the car.

53:43.428 --> 53:45.138
Tell me where you coming from.

53:45.222 --> 53:48.850
I had to pee.
That all right with you? So nosy.

53:48.934 --> 53:51.019
One day you're gonna thank me for nosing.

53:51.102 --> 53:52.812
-Why you late?
-Oh, hey.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.564
None of your business.

53:55.273 --> 53:56.816
-Lord…
-What?

53:57.776 --> 54:01.738
I'll drive by. We'll stop.
You tell him she was coming to get you.

54:01.821 --> 54:03.615
-What you talking about?
-Please, Citsy.

54:03.698 --> 54:05.575
Tell Jackson
she was coming to pick you up.

54:05.659 --> 54:06.785
Who that is?

54:07.619 --> 54:10.288
What's she… what's she doing down here?

54:10.372 --> 54:11.498
Citsy!

54:13.583 --> 54:15.293
Hey, Miss Leanne.

54:15.377 --> 54:17.754
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
I had a ride home.

54:17.837 --> 54:21.174
And you came all this way.
But I'mma have your breakfast ready

54:21.258 --> 54:22.717
bright and early.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.678
Hey, Sheriff.

54:25.428 --> 54:26.346
Citsy.

54:26.888 --> 54:31.017
Aw, she was coming to pick me up.
Now, you ain't gonna tell John, are you?

54:34.980 --> 54:35.939
Well…

54:36.481 --> 54:40.110
Now you and me both know
what you doing down here, don't we?

54:40.652 --> 54:42.487
You watch who you talking to, gal.

54:49.244 --> 54:53.206
Now don't let me see you down here again,
Leanne, or I will have to tell John.

54:53.290 --> 54:54.582
Yessir, Mr. Sheriff.

54:54.666 --> 54:56.835
Let the colored take care of their own.

54:56.918 --> 54:58.795
My, my, my.

55:20.317 --> 55:23.069
Yeah, no, no. No, this is great.
No. This is great.

55:23.153 --> 55:25.822
Okay, okay. I-- Thank you. Yeah, yeah. No.

55:25.905 --> 55:28.908
Uh, I… I understand.
Yeah, we will, uh… we will.

55:28.992 --> 55:31.161
Thank you. Yeah, no, thank you.

55:31.244 --> 55:33.371
I, um-- Yeah. Thank you.

55:33.455 --> 55:35.206
Yeah. Um, we--

55:35.290 --> 55:36.207
Hello.

55:36.291 --> 55:38.043
-We got it.
-Come on!

55:40.003 --> 55:43.006
Yeah. It is just… an audition.

55:43.089 --> 55:45.216
-That's all I need.
-Get out of the way!

55:45.300 --> 55:46.843
-Come on.

55:53.391 --> 55:55.560
Miss Leanne,
what are you doing up this late?

55:55.643 --> 55:57.479
Where do you think you're going?

55:57.562 --> 55:59.647
-You know I work nights at Hattie Mae's.

56:00.315 --> 56:02.484
I need you to help me clean this floor.

56:03.276 --> 56:06.237
I mopped this floor an hour ago, ma'am.

56:06.321 --> 56:07.822
It's not good enough.

56:11.284 --> 56:14.621
Why are you just standing there?
Help me get this stain up.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.540
I don't… I don't see no stain, ma'am.

56:19.000 --> 56:21.628
You do as I say.

56:23.129 --> 56:24.214
Yes, ma'am.

56:24.964 --> 56:26.883
Where do you think you're going?

56:28.134 --> 56:30.011
To change my dress, ma'am.

56:30.804 --> 56:33.473
I said, clean this now.

56:33.556 --> 56:35.892
Miss Leanne,
this is my one good dress.

56:41.689 --> 56:44.526
How dare you?

56:44.609 --> 56:45.944
I'm sorry,

56:47.529 --> 56:49.072
Miss Bucket.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.908
Darling,
what are you doing up so late?

56:53.743 --> 56:54.661
Is it the heat?

56:54.744 --> 56:57.414
She said she can't sleep,
Mr. Clayton.

56:57.497 --> 57:00.041
Now sit right here, Miss Leanne.

57:01.418 --> 57:04.129
I'mma make you something
to help you sleep.

57:04.212 --> 57:06.131
And I'mma get up this stain.

57:07.507 --> 57:09.342
Soon as I change my dress.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.143
You all right?

57:20.103 --> 57:21.104
It's the heat?

57:23.022 --> 57:25.358
You've been getting out of bed
every night now.

57:26.985 --> 57:28.903
You'll get used to being here.

57:30.488 --> 57:31.948
I mean, this is my home.

57:33.366 --> 57:34.367
It's ours now.

57:36.327 --> 57:38.037
This is not my home.

57:42.292 --> 57:44.085
I'm going back to Boston.

57:50.008 --> 57:51.050
Well, uh…

57:53.386 --> 57:54.888
darling, if you left…

57:56.890 --> 57:59.225
you know how much embarrassment
that would cause me?

58:01.478 --> 58:02.979
What would I say to everyone?

58:05.023 --> 58:05.982
Jackson?

58:08.985 --> 58:09.986
Hmm?

58:18.453 --> 58:20.330
To defend my good Clayton name,

58:20.413 --> 58:23.041
I would just tell everybody
that we went for a swim

58:23.124 --> 58:24.751
in the Chattahoochee River

58:25.543 --> 58:27.420
and the current was too strong.

58:31.841 --> 58:32.884
Took you under.

58:35.845 --> 58:38.389
Now, you could have a good life here.

58:43.353 --> 58:45.355
Or no life at all.

58:57.659 --> 58:59.619
We gonna be leaving tomorrow.

59:00.203 --> 59:01.871
I'm going up to Chicago.

59:01.955 --> 59:05.208
Gonna play at the Capitol Royale.

59:06.918 --> 59:08.002
So y'all got it?

59:08.628 --> 59:10.129
Just an audition.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.298
I am worried.

59:12.382 --> 59:16.386
We need… more than him.

59:19.472 --> 59:21.182
Come on over here, Mama.

59:21.266 --> 59:23.518
You don't want to come, do you?

59:23.601 --> 59:25.228
Not on your life.

59:26.479 --> 59:27.355
Uh, Bayou,

59:27.981 --> 59:29.941
get that off the stove for me, please.

59:30.942 --> 59:32.151
Where's Citsy?

59:32.235 --> 59:33.403
Late again.

1:00:20.366 --> 1:00:21.951
So he told you.

1:00:22.035 --> 1:00:24.037
Bayou ain't said a word.

1:00:24.954 --> 1:00:26.956
And I wasn't sure it was you.

1:00:28.666 --> 1:00:30.084
The floor is clean.

1:00:31.669 --> 1:00:32.629
I know.

1:00:37.842 --> 1:00:39.677
Why you acting like this with me?

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:42.847
You been nice to me.

1:00:44.390 --> 1:00:45.266
Why?

1:00:45.767 --> 1:00:46.934
Tell me.

1:00:48.394 --> 1:00:50.063
I saw you with him.

1:00:51.856 --> 1:00:53.858
Jumping on his back at the truck.

1:00:55.068 --> 1:00:56.736
And you're jealous of that?

1:00:57.445 --> 1:00:59.864
That boy love you like breathing.

1:00:59.947 --> 1:01:03.159
He ain't even talked to another girl
the whole time you've been gone.

1:01:03.242 --> 1:01:04.619
He been sick about you.

1:01:05.411 --> 1:01:07.413
Miss Leanne, look at me.

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:10.458
It's a dangerous game y'all playing.

1:01:11.626 --> 1:01:15.380
Now, you can't do this.
Y'all can't do this.

1:01:16.089 --> 1:01:17.840
You made your choice.

1:01:18.341 --> 1:01:20.677
A colored woman's life is hard.

1:01:23.513 --> 1:01:25.431
And it makes me wonder if…

1:01:28.351 --> 1:01:30.395
I could pass, would I?

1:01:31.896 --> 1:01:33.898
So part of me don't blame you.

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:39.529
But most of me is scared for you.

1:01:41.155 --> 1:01:42.073
Citsy, wait.

1:01:44.826 --> 1:01:45.993
Can you do me a favor?

1:01:56.629 --> 1:01:59.340
-Can you give this to him?
-I won't help you with this.

1:01:59.424 --> 1:02:00.258
Please.

1:02:01.259 --> 1:02:03.261
You're gonna get him killed.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:06.097
Please.

1:02:31.497 --> 1:02:32.540
Shit.

1:02:34.417 --> 1:02:35.460
Excuse me.

1:02:45.136 --> 1:02:46.471
Why are you so late?

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:55.062
Be sure you know what you're doing.

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:25.885
Just like old times.

1:03:27.929 --> 1:03:29.305
Nowhere near the same.

1:03:30.723 --> 1:03:32.725
Do you still want to take me away?

1:03:34.727 --> 1:03:35.853
With all my heart.

1:03:37.230 --> 1:03:40.650
I think he'll let me go
if I tell him I'm a Negro.

1:03:40.733 --> 1:03:43.194
Oh no, don't… don't do that.

1:03:44.028 --> 1:03:45.029
Don't do that.

1:03:45.863 --> 1:03:49.158
Everybody in this town knows
them boys' pride bigger than all Georgia.

1:03:49.242 --> 1:03:51.869
Promise me you ain't gonna do that.

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:54.956
You'll make it hard
for every colored person in Georgia

1:03:55.039 --> 1:03:56.541
if them boys know they've been fooled.

1:04:00.002 --> 1:04:02.255
And if something happen to you,
they gonna have to kill me.

1:04:02.338 --> 1:04:04.257
-No.
-Then don't tell them.

1:04:07.677 --> 1:04:10.012
I can't, um…

1:04:10.096 --> 1:04:11.430
I can't see you no more.

1:04:12.515 --> 1:04:13.558
Not like this.

1:04:14.183 --> 1:04:16.185
Bayou, you're all I've got.

1:04:19.188 --> 1:04:22.984
You are the only person
that makes me feel safe.

1:04:23.067 --> 1:04:24.402
This ain't safe.

1:04:24.485 --> 1:04:26.696
I can't… I… I can't see you like this.

1:04:28.197 --> 1:04:32.201
And we go run away, you gonna…
you need to let me save some money.

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:33.911
Then we run off.

1:04:34.453 --> 1:04:36.873
So we gotta stop this till I have enough.

1:05:59.622 --> 1:06:02.959
<i>What's going, kids?</i>
<i>Let's sing a good one. Now, here we go.</i>

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:18.808
-<i>Howdy Doody!</i>

1:06:18.891 --> 1:06:21.852
<i>-You expecting anyone?
</i>

1:06:21.936 --> 1:06:24.814
<i>-No.
</i>

1:06:29.652 --> 1:06:31.988
-<i>Howdy Doody!</i>
-<i> Good!</i>

1:06:44.542 --> 1:06:45.710
Jackson, what's going on?

1:06:47.837 --> 1:06:49.505
That washerwoman's boy.

1:06:49.588 --> 1:06:52.299
Somebody said he whistled at your wife
when he was here today.

1:06:52.383 --> 1:06:53.968
N… That's not true.

1:06:54.051 --> 1:06:56.470
Citsy and I were the only ones here.

1:06:56.554 --> 1:06:58.806
-Who could have said that?
-I did.

1:07:00.725 --> 1:07:02.059
I saw him.

1:07:04.812 --> 1:07:06.939
-Hattie Mae's boy.
-That's the one.

1:07:07.023 --> 1:07:10.026
Come on, brother.
We're gonna round up the boys.

1:07:10.109 --> 1:07:12.778
That's not so. He did not do that.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:15.698
-What, you saying your mama lying?
-Yes. Yes, she is.

1:07:15.781 --> 1:07:16.782
Leanne.

1:07:18.367 --> 1:07:20.745
My wife's always been
protective of the Negroes.

1:07:22.496 --> 1:07:23.414
Come on.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:26.751
Come on, darling. I'll drop you home.

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:28.461
It's all right.

1:07:28.544 --> 1:07:30.713
These coloreds have lost their minds.

1:07:30.796 --> 1:07:33.299
-Stop them. Margaret--
-Oh honey.

1:07:33.382 --> 1:07:37.219
There's no power on this Earth
that can stop a proper Southern gentleman

1:07:37.303 --> 1:07:39.221
from defending his wife's honor.

1:08:05.581 --> 1:08:06.916
What did you do?

1:08:09.543 --> 1:08:11.378
What did you do?

1:08:11.462 --> 1:08:12.546
I saw you.

1:08:13.339 --> 1:08:14.924
I followed you to that mill.

1:08:15.966 --> 1:08:18.803
You letting that monkey lay on top of you.

1:08:19.804 --> 1:08:21.222
I warned you before.

1:08:21.806 --> 1:08:23.849
You will not ruin this life for us.

1:08:26.310 --> 1:08:28.729
-Where do you think you're going?
-I'm telling them everything.

1:08:28.813 --> 1:08:29.897
-Leanne.
-Everything!

1:08:29.980 --> 1:08:31.857
No! No!

1:08:37.863 --> 1:08:39.115
Where are the keys?

1:08:41.826 --> 1:08:44.495
Where are the keys?

1:08:44.578 --> 1:08:47.248
Don't you know that that boy will kill us?

1:08:48.249 --> 1:08:51.585
Look at the hate in his eyes
when he sees coloreds. He will do it.

1:08:51.669 --> 1:08:56.382
You… are… evil.

1:08:59.343 --> 1:09:00.594
Get into the house.

1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:03.973
Get into the house.

1:09:14.859 --> 1:09:15.943
Citsy.

1:09:30.124 --> 1:09:33.169
You be sure and write me
when you get there. Okay?

1:09:33.252 --> 1:09:34.211
Yes, ma'am.

1:09:35.004 --> 1:09:36.005
And Willie,

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:38.757
you lay off that something, ya hear?

1:09:38.841 --> 1:09:40.050
I'm fine, Mama.

1:09:40.885 --> 1:09:41.969
I'm fine.

1:09:44.096 --> 1:09:46.056
Goodbye, Miss Hattie Mae.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:47.516
And thank you.

1:09:47.600 --> 1:09:49.268
-Ira.

1:09:49.852 --> 1:09:50.853
I'll see y'all.

1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:54.648
Go! Go. Go!

1:09:54.732 --> 1:09:56.025
What's wrong with her?

1:09:56.108 --> 1:09:58.944
-You gotta go!
-Citsy, what's the matter?

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:00.446
-What?
-They're coming for ya.

1:10:00.529 --> 1:10:01.363
Who coming?

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:03.115
-What's going on?
-Her mama.

1:10:03.199 --> 1:10:05.326
Her mama said you whistled at her.

1:10:05.409 --> 1:10:06.744
-Leanne and--
-Go!

1:10:06.827 --> 1:10:07.995
-Where is she?
-Just go!

1:10:08.078 --> 1:10:09.705
-Where she at?
-She fine.

1:10:09.788 --> 1:10:11.457
They don't know. They're coming after you.

1:10:11.540 --> 1:10:12.458
What about you?

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:14.877
You know I pay that sheriff.
I'll be fine. Get in the car.

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.670
-Go!
-They don't know--

1:10:17.254 --> 1:10:19.131
Oh! Go.

1:10:31.268 --> 1:10:32.228
Lord.

1:10:32.311 --> 1:10:34.521
-And that's what happened.
-Lord.

1:10:35.773 --> 1:10:37.024
Oh Lord!

1:10:38.442 --> 1:10:39.944
That'll get them killed dead.

1:10:40.027 --> 1:10:43.030
I know, I know, I know. I know.

1:10:46.492 --> 1:10:47.534
There they is.

1:11:00.756 --> 1:11:02.216
-Where is he?
-Where's who?

1:11:02.299 --> 1:11:04.301
Don't you play with me. Your boy.

1:11:04.385 --> 1:11:06.804
Well, they ain't here.
What you want with them?

1:11:06.887 --> 1:11:08.180
Are you lying to us?

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:10.432
No, sir, Sheriff.
They left here this morning.

1:11:10.516 --> 1:11:13.310
Went out west or something, to California.

1:11:18.232 --> 1:11:20.526
-Let's burn it down. Burn it down!
-Yeah!

1:11:22.569 --> 1:11:24.905
You won't let them
burn down my house, Sheriff.

1:11:25.614 --> 1:11:27.866
After all the money
we done made at my place.

1:11:28.367 --> 1:11:29.994
You watch your mouth.

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:38.502
-Where they at?
-He's not here.

1:11:38.585 --> 1:11:39.586
Let's burn it down.

1:11:39.670 --> 1:11:41.005
He ain't here.

1:11:41.088 --> 1:11:43.966
Let's check the train station
or the county line.

1:11:44.550 --> 1:11:46.427
He can't be too far away.

1:11:47.970 --> 1:11:50.222
-Let's go, boys.
-All right, let's go!

1:12:01.567 --> 1:12:03.277
-Please, God, please.

1:12:04.361 --> 1:12:05.237
Citsy.

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:08.282
Ain't no cars here,
so I guess they still looking for him,

1:12:08.365 --> 1:12:09.783
but he got away.

1:12:09.867 --> 1:12:11.118
Thank God.

1:12:11.201 --> 1:12:13.829
Thank God. I was praying.

1:12:13.912 --> 1:12:16.248
If they did something to him,

1:12:16.832 --> 1:12:20.586
I would have stayed here
for the rest of my life… in misery.

1:12:20.669 --> 1:12:22.963
And it would be what I deserve.

1:12:23.047 --> 1:12:24.089
I quit.

1:12:24.173 --> 1:12:25.049
No.

1:12:25.632 --> 1:12:27.676
Look, ain't no way I can stay here.

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:29.011
None.

1:12:29.928 --> 1:12:31.597
Now, I'm sorry, Miss Leanne.

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:33.807
-I wish you well in this struggle.
-Please. Please.

1:12:33.891 --> 1:12:36.560
If you leave, I've got nobody.

1:12:39.646 --> 1:12:43.567
Citsy, don't go, please.
Don't leave me here all by myself, please.

1:12:57.831 --> 1:12:58.916
Are you hungry?

1:13:00.709 --> 1:13:01.960
Can't eat nothing.

1:13:04.004 --> 1:13:05.255
I wanna go back.

1:13:08.008 --> 1:13:09.802
I just left like a coward.

1:13:11.220 --> 1:13:12.346
I left them there.

1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:16.934
-Stop… stop the car.
-What?

1:13:22.606 --> 1:13:23.524
Wait!

1:13:25.943 --> 1:13:26.819
Bayou!

1:13:34.201 --> 1:13:35.327
-Here.

1:13:40.874 --> 1:13:42.042
Wait. Wait.

1:13:47.214 --> 1:13:49.842
When I was in Germany not long ago,

1:13:49.925 --> 1:13:53.011
my family and I were sent to live
in what was called a ghetto

1:13:53.095 --> 1:13:54.555
by the German Army because…

1:13:56.265 --> 1:13:57.641
because we were Jews.

1:13:59.059 --> 1:14:00.310
The conditions were

1:14:02.062 --> 1:14:03.856
terrible. Everything we had was stolen.

1:14:03.939 --> 1:14:06.150
There was no food. Everyone was starving.

1:14:10.904 --> 1:14:13.949
Early one morning, we were awakened
to the sound of the Nazis screaming,

1:14:14.032 --> 1:14:18.287
"Wake up, Jews.
Wake up, you stinking Jews."

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:24.668
We did not know it at the time,
but they had been given orders.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.841
Every Jew who was unable to work
was to be killed.

1:14:34.052 --> 1:14:35.053
And so

1:14:36.722 --> 1:14:38.015
they promised us

1:14:39.516 --> 1:14:41.226
that we were to be moved

1:14:42.644 --> 1:14:44.104
to better conditions.

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:51.403
And we all boarded
these… train cattle cars.

1:14:51.487 --> 1:14:53.071
Many people.

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:56.617
Many people.

1:14:58.327 --> 1:14:59.328
For days.

1:15:00.454 --> 1:15:01.747
In one little car.

1:15:03.832 --> 1:15:07.711
My wife and child were with me,
and we were sent

1:15:08.545 --> 1:15:11.840
to these… camps.

1:15:14.092 --> 1:15:16.720
And we had to be… tested

1:15:17.888 --> 1:15:21.099
to see if we were… fit to work.

1:15:24.728 --> 1:15:26.146
Of course, my wife, Franca,

1:15:26.230 --> 1:15:28.732
could not be tested
while holding our daughter,

1:15:28.815 --> 1:15:32.861
so they shot her and my little girl

1:15:33.654 --> 1:15:35.072
right before my eyes.

1:15:35.948 --> 1:15:38.742
Uh, this ain't making me feel no better.

1:15:41.870 --> 1:15:42.955
I'm telling you this.

1:15:43.038 --> 1:15:47.251
Sometimes you have to just go on
so that you can come back to help.

1:15:47.334 --> 1:15:50.337
I couldn't help… my family.

1:15:57.719 --> 1:15:58.971
But I helped…

1:16:01.390 --> 1:16:02.808
I helped many people.

1:16:04.893 --> 1:16:09.356
Your mother, she is a smart woman.
She knows how to survive.

1:16:09.439 --> 1:16:12.651
And once you learn that too,

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:15.654
how to survive…

1:16:17.698 --> 1:16:19.908
then you will be able to help her.

1:16:26.164 --> 1:16:27.332
Let us go on.

1:17:00.741 --> 1:17:01.658
<i>Dear Mama.</i>

1:17:02.492 --> 1:17:04.036
<i>We made it to Chicago.</i>

1:17:05.412 --> 1:17:07.873
<i>This place is like downtown everywhere.</i>

1:17:09.207 --> 1:17:12.127
<i>Ain't never seen</i>
<i>nothing like this in all my life.</i>

1:17:13.587 --> 1:17:16.006
<i>Ira was so nervous for this thing</i>

1:17:16.089 --> 1:17:18.884
<i>he called an "audition" to get this job.</i>

1:18:11.061 --> 1:18:11.937
Wait here.

1:18:21.154 --> 1:18:23.615
-Ira, you're a persistent man.
-Yes. Thank you.

1:18:23.699 --> 1:18:24.950
-Those are your boys?
-Yes.

1:18:25.033 --> 1:18:27.994
-They are here, and they are excellent.
-Uh, yes, well…

1:18:28.078 --> 1:18:30.789
We have rehearsal here,
so, uh, call my office next week.

1:18:30.872 --> 1:18:33.166
Yes, okay, but I was hoping-- Uh--

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:36.795
-Yes, but we-- They--
-Call me. I'm busy. I'm in a rehearsal!

1:18:41.508 --> 1:18:42.759
Can you believe that?

1:18:43.385 --> 1:18:46.012
Where are you going? Willie!

1:18:54.855 --> 1:18:56.982
-Where is Willie? Where did he go?
-I don't know.

1:18:57.065 --> 1:18:58.734
Okay, you come. You sing.

1:18:58.817 --> 1:19:01.695
What? I can't sing here.
This ain't no juke joint.

1:19:01.778 --> 1:19:03.864
Listen to me.
You want to help your mother?

1:19:03.947 --> 1:19:05.574
Leanne? Then you sing.

1:19:05.657 --> 1:19:08.910
You think of her, and you sing. Okay.

1:19:10.203 --> 1:19:11.079
I'm--

1:19:13.248 --> 1:19:14.207
What song?

1:19:16.460 --> 1:19:17.335
Anything.

1:19:18.336 --> 1:19:21.923
-Anything that makes you think of her.

1:19:23.049 --> 1:19:23.884
Just sing.

1:19:23.967 --> 1:19:26.636
-That's it. Take five. Great work.
-Come on.

1:19:27.304 --> 1:19:29.139
Come on. It's okay.

1:19:31.183 --> 1:19:32.142
Watch your step.

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:47.741
Now.

1:20:18.063 --> 1:20:19.981
Y'all know this song? All right.

1:21:58.038 --> 1:22:00.373
-I was scared to death, Ira.
-Oh, you were great.

1:22:00.457 --> 1:22:02.751
Been singing here for weeks<i>,</i>
and I'm still shaking.

1:22:02.834 --> 1:22:04.794
Shaking like…

1:22:04.878 --> 1:22:05.879
Like what?

1:22:06.379 --> 1:22:08.381
Uh, yeah…

1:22:08.465 --> 1:22:10.050
You get any letters from my mama?

1:22:10.884 --> 1:22:12.052
I've been writing.

1:22:15.430 --> 1:22:16.264
Here.

1:22:17.057 --> 1:22:18.433
Why didn't you say nothing?

1:22:28.276 --> 1:22:31.738
<i>"Dear Bayou, your mama asked me</i>
<i>to write you this letter."</i>

1:22:33.031 --> 1:22:35.575
<i>"She wanted you to know</i>
<i>that she doing fine,</i>

1:22:36.076 --> 1:22:38.161
<i>and she loves you and misses you."</i>

1:22:38.912 --> 1:22:41.414
<i>"Everything seems</i>
<i>to have calmed down here,</i>

1:22:41.498 --> 1:22:44.209
<i>and life is kind of back to normal."</i>

1:22:44.292 --> 1:22:47.671
<i>"And she say, don't worry about her.</i>
<i>You just take care of you,</i>

1:22:47.754 --> 1:22:51.383
<i>and she hope</i>
<i>you and Willie Earl is doing good."</i>

1:22:51.466 --> 1:22:54.302
<i>"And we miss you, and we love you. Citsy."</i>

1:22:54.386 --> 1:22:57.138
-Yeah, she… she doing all right.
-Yes.

1:22:57.222 --> 1:22:59.641
Yeah, thank God.

1:23:00.558 --> 1:23:02.811
She… she ain't mention
nothing about Leanne.

1:23:03.979 --> 1:23:05.647
I am sure she is fine.

1:23:06.773 --> 1:23:08.400
I am sure of it.

1:23:09.776 --> 1:23:12.529
Yeah, I need… I need
to send Mama some… some money.

1:23:13.196 --> 1:23:14.531
Need to write her a letter.

1:23:15.615 --> 1:23:18.410
Ira. What the hell is this, now?

1:23:18.493 --> 1:23:20.870
How the hell they gonna put his name
out there on the marquee?

1:23:20.954 --> 1:23:23.039
That's supposed to say "Willie Earl Boyd,"
not "Bayou."

1:23:23.123 --> 1:23:25.458
The people,
they are coming to see your brother.

1:23:25.542 --> 1:23:29.838
Mr. Carney said that business
is up over 30% since he started singing.

1:23:29.921 --> 1:23:33.133
You said they like us,
and they wanted us for Capitol Royale.

1:23:33.216 --> 1:23:36.886
No. They said they liked Bayou,
and they wanted him for Capitol Royale.

1:23:36.970 --> 1:23:38.972
You walked out<i>,</i> or do you not remember?

1:23:39.055 --> 1:23:41.933
It wasn't easy.
I managed to get us a package deal.

1:23:42.017 --> 1:23:44.477
Okay. Then I'm just going
to have a talk with them then.

1:23:44.561 --> 1:23:45.603
You'll not speak with them.

1:23:46.771 --> 1:23:49.149
How in the hell you gonna tell me
who I ain't gonna talk to?

1:23:49.232 --> 1:23:52.193
I do not care who you speak with,
but you will not speak with Mr. Carney.

1:23:52.277 --> 1:23:56.281
You will not ruin this opportunity for us.

1:23:57.615 --> 1:23:58.491
Please.

1:24:12.213 --> 1:24:15.925
Hey, hey, don't you be gettin' mad at me.
I ain't done you nothing.

1:24:16.009 --> 1:24:17.927
No, you trying to take over.

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:21.222
You's trying to be
the good house nigger.

1:24:21.306 --> 1:24:23.141
You know Ira got a mind of his own.

1:24:23.224 --> 1:24:26.561
Oh, yeah, Ira the one that got Mama
in all that trouble back home too.

1:24:26.644 --> 1:24:27.479
Willie Earl…

1:24:28.063 --> 1:24:29.731
See, now she was doing just fine

1:24:29.814 --> 1:24:32.817
till you came around there
messing with that damn whore.

1:24:39.365 --> 1:24:40.784
You call her that again,

1:24:41.785 --> 1:24:43.495
I'm gonna kick your ass all over--

1:24:43.578 --> 1:24:45.705
Who the hell you think you is, huh?

1:24:46.289 --> 1:24:49.209
-This here was my gig.
-You better not say that shit again!

1:24:50.210 --> 1:24:51.127
You hear me?

1:24:52.045 --> 1:24:54.297
Ain't nobody trying to take over your gig.

1:24:54.380 --> 1:24:56.216
What the hell you trying to do then, huh?

1:24:58.676 --> 1:25:01.513
See, I done worked my ass off to get here.

1:25:02.013 --> 1:25:03.765
Now finally,

1:25:03.848 --> 1:25:06.309

1:25:06.392 --> 1:25:08.478
my own damn brother done gonna put his.

1:25:08.561 --> 1:25:10.105
If anybody took your name,

1:25:11.523 --> 1:25:13.733
it's that mess you're pushing up your arm.

1:25:13.817 --> 1:25:16.528
The Negro race be a whole lot better off

1:25:17.278 --> 1:25:20.949
if you just went on back to… Georgia.

1:25:22.242 --> 1:25:23.451
Let 'em

1:25:24.869 --> 1:25:26.412
hang your black ass.

1:25:38.758 --> 1:25:39.717
<i>Dear Mama.</i>

<i>Hope you've been getting them.</i>

<i>Ira helped me get an apartment.</i>

1:25:58.444 --> 1:25:59.779
<i>I wish you could see it.</i>

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:03.324
<i>It's really nice.</i>
<i>Nicer than what we had down there.</i>

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:10.623
<i>Every night, the line getting</i>
<i>longer and longer at the Capitol Royale.</i>

1:26:11.457 --> 1:26:13.793
<i>People coming</i>
<i>from all over the world, Mama.</i>

1:26:14.502 --> 1:26:16.337
<i>You should see all these white folk.</i>

1:26:17.255 --> 1:26:20.550
<i>Kinda remind me of the time I saw</i>
<i>all the colored people come to your place.</i>

1:26:21.050 --> 1:26:22.385
<i>It's something to see.</i>

1:26:23.011 --> 1:26:25.013
<i>Oh, it is something to see.</i>

1:26:25.597 --> 1:26:28.725
<i>I really hope you've been getting</i>
<i>the money I've been sending to you.</i>

1:26:29.309 --> 1:26:30.643
<i>I'mma keep sending it.</i>

1:26:32.103 --> 1:26:34.606
<i>I really wish you all would tell me</i>
<i>how Leanne doing.</i>

1:26:35.523 --> 1:26:37.442
<i>Ain't heard nothing</i>
<i>from nobody about nothing.</i>

1:26:38.610 --> 1:26:41.362
<i>Hope she doing all right</i>
<i>and that she's safe.</i>

1:26:43.573 --> 1:26:46.701
<i>Ira and Mr. Carney even had me</i>
<i>make a record called "Paper Airplane."</i>

1:26:46.784 --> 1:26:49.621
<i>Mama, I gotta tell you,</i>
<i>can't wait for you to hear it.</i>

1:26:50.455 --> 1:26:52.582
<i>He tell me it's doing pretty well too.</i>

1:26:54.792 --> 1:26:56.044
<i>Willie Earl, Mama,</i>

1:26:56.628 --> 1:26:58.504

<i>And Mama,</i>

1:27:04.636 --> 1:27:06.971

1:27:09.515 --> 1:27:12.143
<i>I gotta go. They just knocked on the door</i>
<i>to say five minutes.</i>

1:27:12.227 --> 1:27:14.687
-Come back tomorrow.
-<i> Sold out again tonight, Mama.</i>

1:27:14.771 --> 1:27:17.273
<i>That's right. Sold out again tonight.</i>

1:27:18.191 --> 1:27:20.777
-We'll add more shows. Thank you.
-<i>Can't wait to see you.</i>

1:27:20.860 --> 1:27:24.656
-Thank you! Thank you!
-<i>I miss you, and I love you.</i>

1:27:24.739 --> 1:27:27.158
<i>-Your son, Bayou.</i>
Sold out.

1:30:03.981 --> 1:30:05.149
Appreciate it, thank you.

1:30:05.233 --> 1:30:08.903
Will you please welcome Miss Laura Brazel
with her African tribal dance?

1:30:37.348 --> 1:30:39.475
Who dat? Who dat, I say?

1:30:39.559 --> 1:30:40.685
Open the door.

1:30:40.768 --> 1:30:43.521
Citsy? Citsy! What are you doing
down here this late?

1:30:43.604 --> 1:30:45.106
We need some help.

1:30:45.189 --> 1:30:47.108
What you bring her here for?

1:30:47.191 --> 1:30:49.318
You need to carry her
to the white folks' doctor.

1:30:49.402 --> 1:30:52.613
-Please help me. The baby's coming.
-Citsy, why'd you bring her here?

1:30:52.697 --> 1:30:54.282
She come down to the kitchen to get me,

1:30:54.365 --> 1:30:56.325
didn't want me
to wake John or her mama up,

1:30:56.409 --> 1:30:57.785
and don't wanna go to the doctor.

1:30:57.869 --> 1:30:59.203
Come on. Bring her over here.

1:30:59.287 --> 1:31:02.582
-Just breathe.
-I'm in so much pain.

1:31:02.665 --> 1:31:04.709
Something's not right. I know it.

1:31:04.792 --> 1:31:07.044
Citsy, run and get John
to carry her to the doctor.

1:31:07.128 --> 1:31:08.504
Hattie, you gotta help her.

1:31:08.588 --> 1:31:09.547
Hattie?

1:31:10.339 --> 1:31:11.674
Hattie Mae!

1:31:15.303 --> 1:31:18.055
-Breathe! Breathe!

1:31:23.060 --> 1:31:25.563
All right. Give me one more.
Give me one more good one.

1:31:25.646 --> 1:31:27.106
One more good one!

1:31:27.190 --> 1:31:29.025
-Come on.

1:31:31.736 --> 1:31:34.906
One, two, three.
Give me one good push.

1:31:40.036 --> 1:31:42.246
Oh my God!

1:31:42.330 --> 1:31:45.458
I'mma cut this cord, and you carry her
to the white folks' hospital.

1:31:45.541 --> 1:31:47.543
-Tell them she had the baby there.
-Okay.

1:31:51.380 --> 1:31:52.882
Leroy? Leroy!

1:31:53.549 --> 1:31:54.717
-Hey, hey, man!
-Hey!

1:31:54.800 --> 1:31:55.968
What you doing here?

1:31:56.469 --> 1:31:58.846
Hey, man. Good to see you.

1:31:58.930 --> 1:32:01.432
Yeah. I come to Chicago
to visit my cousin,

1:32:01.516 --> 1:32:04.143
and I heard on the radio
y'all was appearing nightly.

1:32:04.227 --> 1:32:05.645
-That's how they say it.

1:32:05.728 --> 1:32:07.897
Appearing nightly at the Capitol Royale.

1:32:10.233 --> 1:32:11.651
Y'all done made it, huh?

1:32:11.734 --> 1:32:12.818
Um…

1:32:12.902 --> 1:32:14.779
We doing all right. Sit down, man.

1:32:14.862 --> 1:32:16.364
-Sure.
-Sit down. You looking good.

1:32:16.447 --> 1:32:17.990
Man, not as good as you.

1:32:18.658 --> 1:32:22.870
Wish I could come see the show,
but they don't allow us in there, huh?

1:32:22.954 --> 1:32:25.206
No. No.

1:32:27.124 --> 1:32:29.585
Uh, Willie coming down soon?

1:32:29.669 --> 1:32:31.337
Yeah, as soon as he finish that set.

1:32:31.420 --> 1:32:33.714
Yeah. Hey, you see
my mama before you left?

1:32:33.798 --> 1:32:36.092
Nah, folks don't go by her place no more.

1:32:36.175 --> 1:32:37.635
Don't nobody go by there?

1:32:37.718 --> 1:32:41.097
After that mess… they was all too scared.

1:32:42.348 --> 1:32:44.016
She be getting the money I sent?

1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:45.810
Bayou, you know they checking her mail.

1:32:46.310 --> 1:32:50.231
Last I heard, she took to growing a garden
just to be able to feed herself.

1:32:50.314 --> 1:32:52.024
Can you get some money to her?

1:32:52.108 --> 1:32:53.484
Now, Bayou…

1:32:54.902 --> 1:32:57.280
…you know
I won't be responsible for no money.

1:32:57.863 --> 1:32:59.907
You know I love wine and women too much.

1:33:01.409 --> 1:33:03.953
And you know,
I hear Leanne just had a baby.

1:33:05.121 --> 1:33:07.498
-Yeah, yeah? Come on.

1:33:08.541 --> 1:33:11.294
Oh, excuse me.
I did not know you had a guest.

1:33:11.377 --> 1:33:12.378
It's all right.

1:33:12.461 --> 1:33:13.713
What's the matter?

1:33:15.381 --> 1:33:17.133
Would you excuse us for a moment?

1:33:17.717 --> 1:33:18.551
Sure.

1:33:19.093 --> 1:33:21.470
Uh, Bayou,
tell Willie I'mma be around back.

1:33:21.554 --> 1:33:24.515
Wait for me. I'm gonna get you a letter
to send to her and Citsy, okay?

1:33:24.599 --> 1:33:25.516
Okay, then.

1:33:27.059 --> 1:33:27.977
Evening, sir.

1:33:36.611 --> 1:33:39.447
Ira, I… I need to take
some time off from here.

1:33:39.530 --> 1:33:40.406
What?

1:33:41.032 --> 1:33:43.951
My mama in trouble in Georgia.
I need to go see about her.

1:33:44.619 --> 1:33:48.164
Uh, are you insane?
Those people tried to kill you.

1:33:48.247 --> 1:33:49.749
I already know what you're gonna say.

1:33:50.291 --> 1:33:52.126
But I done spent my whole life running.

1:33:52.209 --> 1:33:53.586
I'm gonna see about her.

1:33:54.378 --> 1:33:55.212
Bayou…

1:33:55.296 --> 1:33:58.382
Look, I done that to her.
My mama a proud woman.

1:33:59.675 --> 1:34:01.385
What if we, uh…

1:34:01.469 --> 1:34:04.680
What if we play one night at her place?
Just one night.

1:34:05.681 --> 1:34:08.684
That'd get the folk to coming back out.
She'd get back on her feet.

1:34:08.768 --> 1:34:10.936
We'd be out of there before you know it.

1:34:11.646 --> 1:34:13.564
I will go and bring her here.

1:34:13.648 --> 1:34:16.067
She don't want to come here.
I have to go there.

1:34:16.817 --> 1:34:19.278
I do not think that is a good idea.

1:34:19.362 --> 1:34:23.115
You said yourself, I don't look like
that poor little colored boy that left.

1:34:23.199 --> 1:34:24.617
And what if they know?

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:26.577
You know well as me
white folk don't care nothing

1:34:26.661 --> 1:34:28.996
about no Negro singing
in no juke joint down there.

1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:30.081
-No?
-No.

1:34:30.956 --> 1:34:32.375
I'm gonna see about my mama.

1:34:33.417 --> 1:34:35.044
Whether you with me or not.

1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:38.881
Is this about your mother

1:34:39.882 --> 1:34:41.092
or Leanne?

1:34:45.888 --> 1:34:46.889
Ira.

1:34:48.474 --> 1:34:51.894
Ira, it's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be all right.

1:34:54.146 --> 1:34:55.981
Now you go on and make the arrangements.

1:34:57.400 --> 1:34:58.401
Just one night.

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:02.488
Just one night.

1:35:21.340 --> 1:35:22.425
Here's your mail.

1:35:26.220 --> 1:35:27.930
Why are all my letters open?

1:35:28.681 --> 1:35:30.182
They come that way.

1:35:30.850 --> 1:35:32.309
Gonna buy something, Hattie?

1:35:42.987 --> 1:35:47.032
<i>That was Bayou Boyd</i>
<i>with his new hit, "Paper Airplane."</i>

1:35:58.711 --> 1:36:00.838
Hello, Miss Leanne. How you doing?

1:36:00.921 --> 1:36:03.132
-I'm fine, Mr. Lincoln.
-How's that baby?

1:36:03.215 --> 1:36:05.718
-Strong as ever.
-Good, good.

1:36:18.731 --> 1:36:19.690
That all?

1:36:20.816 --> 1:36:22.651
Hey, I can't give you no more credit.

1:36:24.278 --> 1:36:26.572
Well, I always paid you on time.

1:36:26.655 --> 1:36:28.949
Not in the last few months. Cash only.

1:36:29.033 --> 1:36:30.284
Let me pay for it.

1:36:40.836 --> 1:36:43.172
You can't be nice to those people,
I tell you.

1:36:44.006 --> 1:36:46.217
-What can I get for you, Miss Leanne?
-Just this.

1:37:01.357 --> 1:37:04.151
I bought you groceries.
It's the least I can do.

1:37:05.444 --> 1:37:09.240
I also… brought a load of laundry for you.

1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:12.952
Ain't you heard? White folks
don't bring me their washings no more.

1:37:13.035 --> 1:37:14.203
If you need work…

1:37:14.912 --> 1:37:17.623
I ain't never in my life
working in no white folks' kitchen.

1:37:18.207 --> 1:37:19.583
I just wanted to tell you

1:37:19.667 --> 1:37:22.753
thank you for all of your help
with the birth of my child.

1:37:23.587 --> 1:37:25.256
I got business to attend to.

1:37:26.465 --> 1:37:27.550
I understand.

1:37:52.449 --> 1:37:53.784
How's your son?

1:37:56.287 --> 1:37:57.204
He fine.

1:37:58.706 --> 1:37:59.540
How your'n?

1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:01.375
He's fine.

1:38:02.793 --> 1:38:04.461
He got his daddy eyes.

1:38:05.921 --> 1:38:06.755
I…

1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:14.138
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

1:38:18.559 --> 1:38:20.728
I can't stop thinking about Bayou.

1:38:23.731 --> 1:38:27.735
I pray every day that he's okay.
Have you heard from him?

1:38:28.277 --> 1:38:29.236
Nope.

1:38:29.737 --> 1:38:30.905
How about a letter?

1:38:32.907 --> 1:38:35.743
If I write him a letter,
will you mail it for me?

1:38:38.162 --> 1:38:39.413
Gal, is you crazy?

1:38:40.205 --> 1:38:42.791
My boy almost got killed behind you.

1:38:43.792 --> 1:38:46.879
I love… your son.

1:38:47.379 --> 1:38:49.256
Then let him be.

1:38:50.966 --> 1:38:52.885
All you think about is yourself.

1:38:53.427 --> 1:38:55.888
You need to start thinking
about the folk you hurt.

1:38:57.389 --> 1:39:00.225
What you would have done
if that baby looked colored?

1:39:00.309 --> 1:39:01.852
What's wrong with you?

1:39:03.228 --> 1:39:04.897
Get on away from round here!

1:39:05.397 --> 1:39:06.774
And take your bag with you.

1:39:56.448 --> 1:39:57.783
Let's hear it for my brother.

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.168
-What's that look for?
-What do you think it is for?

1:40:08.252 --> 1:40:10.462
Mr. Carney is very unhappy
with your brother.

1:40:10.546 --> 1:40:12.631
He does not like
that he takes over the songs.

1:40:12.715 --> 1:40:15.634
-He is always late and so on.
-You ought to talk with him about that.

1:40:15.718 --> 1:40:18.846
He's been getting cash advances
on his pay every night.

1:40:18.929 --> 1:40:22.474
He owes the club… quite a lot of money.

1:40:22.558 --> 1:40:23.767
It's that stuff.

1:40:24.393 --> 1:40:27.479
I just… I… I…
I just gotta help him get off that stuff.

1:40:29.231 --> 1:40:30.733
If it were that easy,

1:40:31.817 --> 1:40:33.902
I would've done it a long time ago.

1:40:41.660 --> 1:40:42.953
Ooh.

1:40:57.301 --> 1:40:58.802
Isn't my brother amazing?

1:41:31.085 --> 1:41:33.712
-I need to speak with you.
-Not now. Not right now.

1:41:51.396 --> 1:41:52.314
Hey, Willie.

1:41:54.817 --> 1:41:55.984

Yeah, uh, Leroy told me about the troubles
she been having. I'm gonna go.

1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:04.701
Mm-hmm.

1:42:05.702 --> 1:42:07.329
Yeah, we're leaving in two days.

1:42:07.955 --> 1:42:08.872
Okay.

1:42:19.216 --> 1:42:20.384
You looking for this?

1:42:23.387 --> 1:42:25.347
-What you doing with my shit?
-All right, hold up.

1:42:25.430 --> 1:42:28.600
Nigga, I said what you doing with my shit.
It ain't none of your damn business.

1:42:28.684 --> 1:42:30.519
-Ira said you gotta lay off.
-You talk to Ira?

1:42:30.602 --> 1:42:32.479
-I'm trying to help!
-I don't need no help.

1:42:32.563 --> 1:42:33.981
Give me my shit.

1:42:34.565 --> 1:42:35.399
Okay.

1:42:42.364 --> 1:42:44.449

1:42:46.910 --> 1:42:49.454
You better give it to me, okay?
I'm gonna count to three.

1:42:50.581 --> 1:42:51.665
One…

1:43:06.096 --> 1:43:07.222
Open the door!

1:43:10.017 --> 1:43:11.226
I'm gonna kill you.

1:43:11.310 --> 1:43:13.645
-Give me my shit, man.
-Hey!

1:43:13.729 --> 1:43:14.771

-No, he got my shit.

1:43:17.024 --> 1:43:19.401
Okay, Bayou, give it to him now, please.

1:43:20.027 --> 1:43:22.362
Willie, Willie, please. Willie, please.

1:43:23.488 --> 1:43:24.448
Okay, okay!

1:43:24.531 --> 1:43:26.658
-Okay.
-What in the hell is this?

1:43:26.742 --> 1:43:27.910
Are you insane?

1:43:27.993 --> 1:43:30.412
Ira. I can't take any more of this.

1:43:30.495 --> 1:43:32.247
You are fired.

1:43:32.331 --> 1:43:34.666
-Wait. What? No, no, no.
-You heard me.

1:43:34.750 --> 1:43:37.002
-He started it.
-Get out of here.

1:43:37.085 --> 1:43:38.545
-You don't know--
-Ira.

1:43:38.629 --> 1:43:40.005
-Hey, hey.

1:43:40.088 --> 1:43:42.925

1:43:43.008 --> 1:43:45.636
How you gonna let him fire me

1:43:45.719 --> 1:43:48.347
Hey, we've been together
since long before this boy came along.

1:43:48.430 --> 1:43:51.183
-Come on, you know. Come on, we go--
-Hey…

1:43:53.518 --> 1:43:54.728
I cannot help you.

1:43:55.229 --> 1:43:57.064
-But I helped your ass, didn't I?
-Yes.

1:43:57.147 --> 1:44:00.359
Didn't I help your ass,
and now you gonna let him do this to me?

1:44:01.068 --> 1:44:03.195
Okay, okay.

1:44:04.696 --> 1:44:05.906
You set me up.

1:44:05.989 --> 1:44:07.658
Stop them. No!

1:44:07.741 --> 1:44:10.202
-Stop!
-No, no! You set me up.

1:44:10.285 --> 1:44:12.746
And you been doing this
since we were children.

1:44:13.455 --> 1:44:14.790
No, no, no, no.

1:44:22.130 --> 1:44:24.675
You be damn sure

1:44:26.260 --> 1:44:27.511
This shit ain't over.

1:44:29.012 --> 1:44:30.639
I hate your black ass.

1:44:48.865 --> 1:44:49.700
Good morning.

1:44:49.783 --> 1:44:51.785
-Citsy, look at him.
-What is it?

1:44:52.369 --> 1:44:53.870
I think he's getting darker.

1:44:53.954 --> 1:44:55.330
Oh, he look the same to me.

1:44:55.956 --> 1:44:59.459
Same as yesterday
and… the day before that.

1:44:59.543 --> 1:45:03.046
-And the day before that.
-No, Citsy. I think he's getting darker.

1:45:03.130 --> 1:45:05.215
Calm down.

1:45:06.216 --> 1:45:07.509
Can I get you something?

1:45:08.093 --> 1:45:09.428
No, I can't eat anything.

1:45:14.182 --> 1:45:16.059
Read this, give it back to me.

1:45:18.186 --> 1:45:19.313
<i>"Dear Leanne."</i>

1:45:20.105 --> 1:45:22.232
<i>"I'll be there Saturday after next."</i>

1:45:22.858 --> 1:45:24.359
<i>"Be ready to leave with me."</i>

1:45:24.985 --> 1:45:26.862
<i>"I ain't gonna argue with you about this,</i>

1:45:27.529 --> 1:45:28.905
<i>but you're coming with me."</i>

1:45:29.531 --> 1:45:31.366
<i>"Citsy will tell you where to meet."</i>

1:45:33.994 --> 1:45:35.537
He's coming to get me.

1:45:43.420 --> 1:45:45.422
He's coming to get us, baby.

1:45:48.884 --> 1:45:51.720
Sure is good of Bayou
to come do this for you, ain't it?

1:45:51.803 --> 1:45:53.347
Yeah, but I don't like it.

1:45:54.139 --> 1:45:56.933
I want him out of here
as soon as it's over.

1:45:58.769 --> 1:46:00.645
You sure them Clayton boys don't know?

1:46:00.729 --> 1:46:01.813
Child,

1:46:02.439 --> 1:46:05.567
them boys busy trying to run this town.
They ain't thinking about us.

1:46:06.735 --> 1:46:08.904
You ain't tell her Bayou coming, did you?

1:46:12.574 --> 1:46:14.743
-I'm sorry, Hattie.
-Now how come you do that?

1:46:14.826 --> 1:46:17.871
He got a right to know that it's his baby.

1:46:17.954 --> 1:46:19.664
She best keep her mouth shut.

1:46:24.461 --> 1:46:25.629

1:47:11.383 --> 1:47:14.261
-But…
-Get up. Get up, get up.

1:47:14.344 --> 1:47:15.720
Mama here?

1:47:15.804 --> 1:47:17.222
No, she in Georgia.

1:47:17.889 --> 1:47:19.891
-We're going to see her.

1:47:19.975 --> 1:47:21.226
Come on now.

1:47:22.352 --> 1:47:26.022
-Come on, Willie. Put these on.

1:47:27.190 --> 1:47:29.734
-Put these here.
-They gonna kill you.

1:47:29.818 --> 1:47:33.613
How… how I'm gonna be glad
when they do too.

1:47:35.282 --> 1:47:37.200
I hate your black ass.

1:47:42.330 --> 1:47:44.666
Ah, you got me fired, didn't you?

1:47:44.749 --> 1:47:48.128
No. That shit you're using
got you fired, Willie.

1:47:48.211 --> 1:47:49.546
Now sit up, sit up.

1:47:49.629 --> 1:47:51.423
-Sit up now, sit up. Get up.

1:47:51.506 --> 1:47:55.051
You been jealous of me.
I went all the way up to Chicago with him.

1:47:55.969 --> 1:47:58.263
You had to stay home with Mama.

1:47:58.847 --> 1:48:00.056
You…

1:48:00.140 --> 1:48:02.100
You… you half-breed.

1:48:02.184 --> 1:48:04.936
All right? You--
My… my daddy ain't your daddy.

1:48:06.229 --> 1:48:08.732
My daddy showed me everything.

1:48:09.816 --> 1:48:11.568
He showed me how to play.

1:48:11.651 --> 1:48:13.862
-He showed me how--
-Get--

1:48:13.945 --> 1:48:15.572
How to get high.

1:48:16.698 --> 1:48:18.742
Stand up, stand up.

1:48:19.659 --> 1:48:21.578
They shot him right in front of me.

1:48:25.248 --> 1:48:27.709
His brains was all over me.

1:48:33.715 --> 1:48:37.594
You know, I wish I ain't seen
all I saw with him sometimes.

1:48:37.677 --> 1:48:41.264
See, Mama… Mama might have loved you more.

1:48:43.892 --> 1:48:45.310
My… my daddy…

1:48:48.146 --> 1:48:51.274
My daddy sure loved me more
than he loved you.

1:48:56.696 --> 1:48:58.323
-All right, now.

1:49:03.703 --> 1:49:05.121
-Come on.
-Hold on now.

1:49:05.205 --> 1:49:08.500
-I can't leave here without my shit.
-I'll get you some more.

1:49:08.583 --> 1:49:09.918
I need enough.

1:49:11.044 --> 1:49:12.587
Where my… where my horn at?

1:49:14.172 --> 1:49:17.634

Oh, I missed you so much, Mama.

1:49:53.169 --> 1:49:55.255

Oh, my word.

1:50:07.892 --> 1:50:09.477

Excuse me, sir.

1:50:57.484 --> 1:50:58.902

To the outhouse.
