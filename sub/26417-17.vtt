00:12.719 --> 00:15.420
- Eddie, no more computer!
- Whoa.

00:15.421 --> 00:17.806
This knock-off version of
"The Sims" is so accurate.

00:17.807 --> 00:19.479
It even sounds like Mom.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.502
Eddie!

00:21.177 --> 00:23.317
It's noon and you're
still in your pajamas?

00:23.319 --> 00:25.844
I was up all night making
computer versions of our family.

00:25.845 --> 00:27.818
It took me four hours to
get Dad's hair right.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.309
Did you do the laundry like I asked you?

00:29.310 --> 00:30.576
I said I'd get to it.

00:30.577 --> 00:32.561
Off the computer now
and go do the laundry.

00:33.725 --> 00:36.810
And go take a shower.

00:36.811 --> 00:38.594
You smell like hot-dog water.

00:48.981 --> 00:51.768
Believe me, little dude... I get it.

00:56.947 --> 00:59.133
<b><font color="#ff0000">Sync and corrections by btsix

01:12.830 --> 01:14.715
Thanks for letting me
borrow your hammer, Louis.

01:14.716 --> 01:16.684
The hardware store near my
apartment stopped selling them

01:16.685 --> 01:19.053
- after all the murders.
- Mm, no problem, Horace.

01:19.054 --> 01:20.864
Moving into your first
apartment is hard work.

01:20.865 --> 01:23.591
Oh, and I, uh, marked it
with an "H" for "Huang"

01:23.592 --> 01:24.965
so we don't get mixed up.

01:24.966 --> 01:28.162
But "H" is also for
"Horace." And hammer.

01:28.163 --> 01:29.565
But that "H" is for "Huang."

01:29.566 --> 01:31.881
I'll bring it back as soon as
I'm done decorating my place

01:31.882 --> 01:33.501
the way I want to.

01:33.502 --> 01:36.766
"Oh, oh, you think the Elvira poster
is too sexy for my room, Mom?

01:36.767 --> 01:39.039
Well, that's too bad,
because it's my place!"

01:40.701 --> 01:42.408
Uh, Elvira?

01:42.409 --> 01:45.191
- She's... kind of... hot.
- Oh. Okay.

01:45.192 --> 01:47.936
You know, my first apartment
was above a saxophone store.

01:47.937 --> 01:49.616
I used to tell people
I live on the corner

01:49.617 --> 01:51.352
of Rhythm and Blues.

01:51.353 --> 01:53.620
Until the mailman told me to stop.

01:53.621 --> 01:56.340
Hey, I should find my
old lease and frame it!

01:56.981 --> 01:59.179
Man, living alone must be
awesome. I can't wait.

01:59.180 --> 02:00.594
When I have my own place, I'm gonna have

02:00.595 --> 02:01.595
a beat-box answering machine.

02:01.596 --> 02:03.230
"Leave a message after the..."

02:04.566 --> 02:06.100
- "...beat."
- Yes!

02:06.101 --> 02:07.727
Living alone is great, man.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.913
I can do whatever I
want, whenever I want.

02:09.913 --> 02:12.272
I haven't felt this free since
I went on Cultural Exchange

02:12.273 --> 02:13.741
to Taiwan when I was 16.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.075
Say what now?

02:15.076 --> 02:17.192
You know, when you go all over Taiwan

02:17.193 --> 02:19.046
with a bunch of other
teenagers on a bus?

02:19.047 --> 02:20.280
They say it's educational,

02:20.281 --> 02:21.849
but the only thing I learned

02:21.850 --> 02:24.426
is how to smooch girls with
a mouth full of tapioca.

02:24.427 --> 02:26.253
But what about your parents?

02:26.254 --> 02:28.009
The best part about Cultural Exchange...

02:28.011 --> 02:29.192
No parents.

02:30.792 --> 02:32.726
Hey, is it cool if I take this?

02:32.727 --> 02:34.821
Thanks, man. Housewarming gift.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.898
Eddie? I said no more video games.

02:37.899 --> 02:40.067
I need the computer to
instant-message with Honey

02:40.068 --> 02:41.468
while she's on bed rest.

02:41.469 --> 02:43.352
I already have my topics all picked out.

02:43.353 --> 02:46.206
But Computer Eddie just
ordered bottle service.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.207
Who cares? He's a pixel blob!

02:48.208 --> 02:50.822
Now, off the computer or no
seeing your friends for a week.

02:50.823 --> 02:52.980
Fine. I'll just play with my
"digital friends" instead.

02:52.981 --> 02:55.149
Fine. I'll just pack you a digital lunch

02:55.150 --> 02:56.650
for school tomorrow instead.

02:56.651 --> 02:57.818
"Microsoft Sandwich".

02:57.819 --> 02:59.720
Fine. I'll just raid the
freshmen learning garden.

02:59.721 --> 03:00.932
They don't need that much rosemary.

03:00.933 --> 03:03.257
Okay, you want to use the computer?

03:03.258 --> 03:05.925
- Then you can teach Grandma.
- Whoo!

03:05.926 --> 03:09.029
What?! You know that's way
worse than no computer.

03:09.030 --> 03:11.131
Why can't you just give
me a little space?

03:11.132 --> 03:13.331
I would love to give you a little space,

03:13.332 --> 03:15.469
but parenting you is a full-time job.

03:15.470 --> 03:18.915
Ask Jeeves to look for "Tom Selleck...

03:18.916 --> 03:21.110
plus shirtless".

03:24.796 --> 03:27.064
Who designed this house?
The Harlem Globetrotters?

03:27.065 --> 03:28.810
Allow me.

03:29.522 --> 03:32.569
There's that famous volleyball
reach I've heard so much about.

03:35.286 --> 03:37.157
Cowboy boots? When did that start?

03:37.158 --> 03:39.193
A few weeks ago. You didn't notice?

03:39.194 --> 03:41.075
Oh, of course I did.

03:41.076 --> 03:42.805
Started a few weeks ago.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.683
Well, I'm worried about him,
and it's not just the boots.

03:45.684 --> 03:47.067
He's seemed different lately.

03:47.068 --> 03:48.152
Emery?

03:48.153 --> 03:49.854
No. You could set your
watch by that kid.

03:49.855 --> 03:50.906
I'm sure it's nothing.

03:50.907 --> 03:52.857
He's probably just parting
his hair the opposite way.

03:52.858 --> 03:54.892
He isn't, and I would know.

03:54.893 --> 03:56.060
I'm the one that does his hair.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.511
You do your brother's hair?

03:57.512 --> 03:59.203
So? I have the time.

03:59.703 --> 04:01.298
I think he might be
going through something

04:01.299 --> 04:02.933
and he doesn't know how to tell us.

04:02.934 --> 04:06.201
Well, I'm sure, if it's anything
important, he would tell me.

04:06.202 --> 04:07.524
We've been really connecting lately,

04:07.525 --> 04:09.244
ever since our Chinese New Year tussle.

04:09.245 --> 04:11.408
We even discovered a
mutual love of volleyball.

04:11.409 --> 04:13.811
- Since when do you like volleyball?
- Since always.

04:13.812 --> 04:16.124
Spatch! That's a volleyball term.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.432
Okay, if nothing's going on,

04:18.433 --> 04:21.435
explain why I found this on his desk.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.954
The Cowboy Palace Saloon?

04:23.955 --> 04:25.339
He could've gotten this anywhere.

04:25.340 --> 04:27.267
Besides, the boy has a lot of candles.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.417
Louis!

04:28.418 --> 04:30.294
Printer's ink run out.

04:30.295 --> 04:32.314
Tom's chest soaked it up.

04:36.037 --> 04:38.852
I need a new name for Instant Messenger.

04:38.853 --> 04:40.187
Jessica Huang was taken,

04:40.188 --> 04:42.940
so I have Jessica-Computer-Name,

04:42.941 --> 04:44.275
Chinese-Barbara-Bush,

04:44.276 --> 04:45.776
or Deidres-A-Poop-6.

04:45.777 --> 04:48.061
Ooh, tough call. They're all great.

04:48.062 --> 04:49.754
Anyway, Mother,

04:49.755 --> 04:51.798
I was thinking, and you're right...

04:51.799 --> 04:53.438
How we both need a little space.

04:53.439 --> 04:54.752
In the words of Louis Armstrong,

04:54.753 --> 04:56.049
"And I think to myself...

04:56.688 --> 04:58.122
w-what a dope-ass world."

04:58.123 --> 04:59.439
I owe it to myself to get out there.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.258
- Uh-huh.
- Which is why

05:01.259 --> 05:02.426
I would like your permission to go

05:02.427 --> 05:03.860
on the Cultural Exchange trip to Taiwan.

05:13.788 --> 05:15.072
What are we laughing about?

05:15.073 --> 05:18.075
You! Going on a Cultural Exchange!

05:18.076 --> 05:19.710
Wh-What's so funny about that?

05:19.711 --> 05:21.712
You can't survive on your own.

05:21.713 --> 05:23.305
I do everything for you.

05:23.306 --> 05:24.640
I wake you up for school,

05:24.641 --> 05:26.567
I cook for you, I do your laundry...

05:26.568 --> 05:28.152
Hey, I did the laundry this time.

05:28.153 --> 05:30.955
Only because I hounded
you until you did it.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.756
You're like a little baby bird

05:32.757 --> 05:34.542
who sits in front of
the computer all day

05:34.543 --> 05:37.044
and would die if his
beautiful mother bird

05:37.045 --> 05:39.212
stopped regurgitating
worms into his mouth.

05:39.213 --> 05:41.091
So I'm sorry, but the answer is no.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.368
Every time I think we've
gone and turned a corner,

05:44.369 --> 05:46.103
you go right back to
treating me like I'm a baby!

05:46.104 --> 05:48.906
I'm 16 years old. I can
look after myself!

05:48.907 --> 05:50.290
I'm going on that trip.

05:50.291 --> 05:52.743
Well, I'll call the program and
tell them not to accept you.

05:52.744 --> 05:55.474
As long as you live under my
roof, you go by my rules.

05:55.476 --> 05:57.894
Fine. Then maybe it's time I
didn't live under your roof.

05:59.118 --> 06:01.232
Fine! You know where the door is.

06:05.352 --> 06:08.545
Ooh, Orlando State is selling
a DNA gene sequencer.

06:08.546 --> 06:11.178
That lab fire is the gift
that keeps on giving.

06:11.179 --> 06:13.230
Mm-hmm. So, uh, Emery,

06:13.231 --> 06:15.132
excited about volleyball practice?

06:15.133 --> 06:16.783
You know, I was reading that volleyball

06:16.784 --> 06:18.435
is the number-one sport amongst nudists.

06:18.436 --> 06:21.655
- What's a nudist?
- Uh, doesn't matter.

06:21.656 --> 06:22.856
Everything good with you, though?

06:22.857 --> 06:25.892
No, uh, troubles at
school or anywhere else,

06:25.893 --> 06:29.079
like a roadhouse or a
Western-themed speakeasy?

06:29.080 --> 06:31.099
Nope! All good. You know me, Dad.

06:32.620 --> 06:34.821
I do, don't I?

06:35.416 --> 06:37.100
Mr. Volleyball.

06:39.587 --> 06:41.172
Have a good practice, son.

06:42.451 --> 06:44.961
Bye.

06:48.734 --> 06:51.368
See? I was right. Emery is fine.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.836
He's just a good, old-fashioned,

06:52.837 --> 06:54.697
cowboy-boot-wearing, volleyball-playing,

06:54.698 --> 06:56.156
nudist-ignorant kid.

06:56.157 --> 06:57.214
Uh-huh.

06:57.215 --> 07:01.338
So, have you ever actually
seen him play or...?

07:06.090 --> 07:08.916
Uh, hi. I'm Louis Huang, Emery's dad.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.097
Who?

07:10.098 --> 07:13.108
Uh, Louis Huang. I run
the steakhouse off I-4.

07:14.278 --> 07:16.293
The one next to the haunted supermarket.

07:16.294 --> 07:17.728
No, who are you looking for?

07:17.729 --> 07:18.779
Uh, Emery Huang.

07:18.780 --> 07:20.814
Oh, the Chinese kid.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.149
Yeah, he quit the team weeks ago.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.238
Sebastian!

07:23.239 --> 07:25.838
Get your hair out of your
mouth and play volleyball!

07:28.668 --> 07:32.376
You need to stop hanging your
bras on the clothesline outside.

07:32.377 --> 07:34.435
A bird made a nest in one of the cups.

07:34.436 --> 07:36.129
Well, this is it.

07:36.130 --> 07:38.503
I'm really doing it. I'm
really running away.

07:38.956 --> 07:40.084
Okay.

07:43.972 --> 07:45.472
You're letting him leave?

07:46.863 --> 07:48.674
Please. He's gonna get hungry

07:48.675 --> 07:50.821
and be back in here in 10 minutes.

07:50.822 --> 07:53.675
Then who is that picking him up?

07:59.387 --> 08:01.188
Horace?

08:02.501 --> 08:06.026
Oh, here comes Selleck's groin.

08:09.705 --> 08:12.268
Tell me about it, Commander Beefcake.

08:12.270 --> 08:15.422
Ha! Oh, Susan!

08:15.423 --> 08:19.673
Everything does happen to you
very suddenly, doesn't it?

08:20.348 --> 08:21.599
Jessica.

08:21.630 --> 08:24.170
_

08:24.172 --> 08:26.336
Worried? I'm thrilled.

08:26.337 --> 08:28.722
A break from being
Eddie's full-time mom?

08:28.723 --> 08:31.686
I feel like I'm on one of those
fancy white-people cruises

08:31.687 --> 08:33.323
where everybody gets diarrhea.

08:33.325 --> 08:36.749
_

08:36.940 --> 08:39.207
_

08:39.376 --> 08:42.006
_

08:43.400 --> 08:45.490
Connie used to do this all the time.

08:45.491 --> 08:47.004
If she didn't get her way,

08:47.005 --> 08:49.950
she'd run off and spend the
night in a grain silo.

08:49.951 --> 08:51.473
But she always came home.

08:51.475 --> 08:52.987
Trust me.

08:52.988 --> 08:57.177
Eddie is not mature enough to
survive in the world without me.

08:57.178 --> 09:00.333
He's probably in a grain silo right now,

09:00.334 --> 09:03.376
ruing the day he ever
left his comfortable bed.

09:06.324 --> 09:09.259
Welcome to Chez Horace.

09:11.663 --> 09:14.347
This is it? How long have you been here?

09:14.348 --> 09:15.631
Ah, just a few weeks.

09:15.632 --> 09:17.100
It's really starting to come together.

09:17.101 --> 09:19.737
- Hoo.
- Where do you even sleep?

09:19.738 --> 09:21.214
My waterbed.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.271
I made it myself.

09:24.421 --> 09:26.723
Go ahead. Take it for a spin. Eh, no.

09:27.713 --> 09:28.745
Cool.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.964
I'm gonna use you to solve the puzzle

09:33.966 --> 09:35.933
that has plagued scientists
for centuries...

09:35.935 --> 09:37.488
Was Eddie adopted?

09:37.489 --> 09:39.089
Stop talking to the gene sequencer

09:39.090 --> 09:40.324
and keep an eye out for Emery.

09:40.325 --> 09:41.678
Are you gonna confront him?

09:41.679 --> 09:43.510
Just be aware, he spooks easily.

09:43.511 --> 09:45.943
He almost killed Grandma last
time she wore a mud mask.

09:45.944 --> 09:48.149
No, I'm not gonna call him out
and risk how far we've come

09:48.150 --> 09:49.637
since Chinese New Year.

09:49.638 --> 09:51.604
Besides, I'm sure he has
a reasonable explanation

09:51.605 --> 09:52.872
for why he quit the volleyball team.

09:52.874 --> 09:53.905
There he is!

09:54.940 --> 09:57.073
And he's... sweaty?

09:58.844 --> 10:00.477
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:00.478 --> 10:01.812
So, how was practice?

10:01.813 --> 10:04.447
Great. Coach says my spatch
game is really coming together.

10:10.201 --> 10:12.636
Horace, don't take this the wrong way,

10:12.638 --> 10:15.597
but your apartment blows.
Like, really blows.

10:15.598 --> 10:17.728
Like, I can't believe
you left home for this.

10:17.729 --> 10:18.995
What were you thinking?

10:19.458 --> 10:21.107
The truth is,

10:21.109 --> 10:22.402
I didn't move out.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.439
- My parents kicked me out.
- What?

10:24.441 --> 10:25.952
Why didn't you tell me that before?

10:25.953 --> 10:27.287
I was embarrassed!

10:27.288 --> 10:28.922
And plus I was hoping you would bring

10:28.923 --> 10:30.674
some luxury items from your house,

10:30.675 --> 10:33.944
like pillows or lamps or toilet paper.

10:33.945 --> 10:36.441
I've been using a sack
of rice as a pillow,

10:36.442 --> 10:38.215
and now my neck is so jacked up,

10:38.216 --> 10:39.964
I think one of my arms
is permanently asleep.

10:42.034 --> 10:43.726
Yeah, that's not good.

10:44.556 --> 10:47.024
I can't go back now, let my mom win.

10:47.025 --> 10:48.370
Hey, do you want something to drink?

10:48.371 --> 10:50.110
I don't have any glasses
yet, but I can rinse out

10:50.111 --> 10:51.860
an old bottle of contact lens solution.

10:53.966 --> 10:55.549
I think I'm just gonna turn in.

10:55.550 --> 10:56.691
Okay.

10:56.692 --> 10:58.652
Well, good night, Eddie.

10:58.653 --> 10:59.779
It's good to have you here.

10:59.780 --> 11:02.355
And you can stay as long as you want.

11:15.554 --> 11:17.454
I think I made a big mistake.

11:17.455 --> 11:19.706
God, me too, man.

11:19.707 --> 11:21.264
Me, too.

11:27.199 --> 11:28.671
_

11:28.672 --> 11:30.672
_

11:32.077 --> 11:34.254
_

11:43.483 --> 11:45.215
Thank God...

11:46.885 --> 11:48.904
I knew it. I knew you couldn't survive

11:48.905 --> 11:51.385
out there on your own without
me, and I was right.

11:51.386 --> 11:52.923
Come on now. Get up.

11:52.924 --> 11:54.351
It's after 5:00.

11:54.352 --> 11:57.200
Hey, um... can I get a glass of milk?

11:59.056 --> 12:01.157
- Oh...
- What are you doing in my house?

12:01.159 --> 12:04.134
To be honest, I just needed a
dry bed and something to eat.

12:04.135 --> 12:05.588
I don't have any food...

12:05.589 --> 12:07.409
or furniture at my house.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.339
It's, um... It's kind of a dump.

12:09.340 --> 12:11.424
What? And you just left Eddie there?

12:11.425 --> 12:13.393
No. He was gone when I woke up.

12:13.394 --> 12:14.811
Gone where?

12:14.812 --> 12:16.351
Here, I assume.

12:16.352 --> 12:17.580
Is he not here?

12:20.872 --> 12:22.532
Now, about that milk...

12:24.518 --> 12:27.557
And the coach said you're
having a special extra practice

12:27.558 --> 12:29.540
so you can watch "Top Gun" as a team?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.727
Just the volleyball scenes.

12:30.728 --> 12:33.664
Oh.

12:33.665 --> 12:34.981
Have a good practice, Emery.

12:34.982 --> 12:36.916
Thanks.

12:36.917 --> 12:39.035
If that is your real name.

12:41.239 --> 12:43.680
And now the stakeout begins.

12:44.609 --> 12:46.262
I brought a bag of disguises.

12:46.795 --> 12:48.261
Are you okay playing a woman?

12:48.262 --> 12:50.196
Shh, there he is.

12:50.197 --> 12:51.398
Yes.

13:06.264 --> 13:08.248
Follow that Huang.

13:15.841 --> 13:17.892
Meet Dr. Lucas Palindrome,

13:17.894 --> 13:20.760
a psychiatrist from Brooklyn, New York.

13:20.761 --> 13:22.741
That's the bar from the matchbook.

13:25.348 --> 13:27.300
Is he really going in there?

13:27.301 --> 13:28.868
Hey.

13:28.869 --> 13:31.052
He quit volleyball so he
could underage drink.

13:31.053 --> 13:32.463
What a waste.

13:33.090 --> 13:34.826
What do you say you dress
up as Mrs. Palindrome

13:34.827 --> 13:36.853
and we get our pictures
taken at the mall?

13:36.854 --> 13:38.729
Wait in the car and lock the doors.

13:38.730 --> 13:39.979
Where are you going, Melinda?

13:39.980 --> 13:41.564
To rescue my son!

13:42.915 --> 13:46.083
Our son! Our son, Melinda!

13:47.606 --> 13:49.161
Whoa there, partner. You can't...

13:49.162 --> 13:51.510
I own a Western-style steakhouse.

13:51.511 --> 13:53.176
Now get your damn hand off me.

14:15.742 --> 14:18.952
If we go to the airport,
it's a $45 flat fee.

14:18.953 --> 14:21.020
Just so you know. This
is all your fault.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.455
My fault? What did I do?

14:22.456 --> 14:23.974
You lost him!

14:23.975 --> 14:27.127
If he's not huddled up in your
crack den like a fetal mouse,

14:27.128 --> 14:28.394
he could be anywhere.

14:28.395 --> 14:31.548
No offense, but you lost him first.

14:35.453 --> 14:36.853
Okay, we're here.

14:39.231 --> 14:41.291
Hey, if you see anybody
with a hammer, run!

14:43.994 --> 14:46.344
Oh, hey, man. I just went down to
the Goodwill and picked up some...

14:46.346 --> 14:48.580
Oh, my God, Eddie, you're...

14:48.582 --> 14:50.236
thriving!

14:50.238 --> 14:53.057
Hey, if either of you lost a
tooth, it's in the stairwell.

14:58.299 --> 15:00.721
Mom? What are you doing here?

15:00.722 --> 15:03.156
I was worried you...

15:03.157 --> 15:05.010
forgot to bring clean underwear.

15:05.011 --> 15:08.778
Knowing you, you probably left
home without packing any spares.

15:08.779 --> 15:11.044
For your information,
I packed eight pairs.

15:11.045 --> 15:12.552
That way, I can do laundry on Sunday

15:12.553 --> 15:14.101
and not have to wear my
swimsuit as underwear.

15:14.102 --> 15:16.304
We all know that mesh never recovers.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.205
You figured it out.

15:18.207 --> 15:20.908
I love what you've done
to this place, man.

15:20.909 --> 15:24.235
I mean, it's not really my
style, but... it works.

15:24.728 --> 15:26.845
Eddie did this?

15:26.847 --> 15:28.517
By himself?

15:28.518 --> 15:30.611
I told you I can take
care of myself, Mom.

15:30.612 --> 15:32.253
When are you gonna start believing me?

15:32.254 --> 15:34.739
Fine. We'll talk about
it on the way home.

15:34.740 --> 15:36.466
No, we won't.

15:36.467 --> 15:38.124
I'm going to the store to buy olive oil

15:38.125 --> 15:40.016
for the bruschetta I'm
making for tonight's dinner.

15:40.017 --> 15:42.496
Horace only owns... massage oil.

15:42.947 --> 15:45.283
- You went through my nightstand?
- You mean the Mervyn's bag

15:45.284 --> 15:46.841
hanging on the bathroom door handle?

15:46.842 --> 15:48.353
I thought that was trash.

15:48.354 --> 15:49.938
Stay out of my stuff, man.

16:01.349 --> 16:03.505
Dad? What are you doing here?

16:03.506 --> 16:05.884
What are you doing here? In a bar?

16:05.885 --> 16:07.805
And why did you quit volleyball?

16:07.806 --> 16:09.190
Because I hate volleyball.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.542
But you said you loved it.

16:11.543 --> 16:14.336
I did at the beginning.
And then I didn't.

16:14.337 --> 16:15.603
But by the time I figured that out,

16:15.604 --> 16:17.265
you'd already gone and
made it "our thing".

16:17.266 --> 16:19.332
All of a sudden, you
were Mr. Volleyball.

16:19.334 --> 16:20.568
No, I wasn't.

16:20.569 --> 16:22.920
You drove me to Tampa so I
could get my volleyball signed

16:22.921 --> 16:25.369
by former Olympic bronze
medalist Yoko Zetterlund.

16:25.370 --> 16:26.909
Like I even know who that is!

16:26.910 --> 16:29.794
You said that was one of the
top five moments of your life.

16:29.795 --> 16:30.868
Well, I lied!

16:33.900 --> 16:35.259
Look, this is my song.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.951
I gotta go. I'll see you at home.

16:39.988 --> 16:43.024
I am a terrible mother. No, you're not.

16:43.025 --> 16:45.087
You just pushed too hard.
Being a mom is tough,

16:45.089 --> 16:46.527
and nobody's perfect.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.938
- God knows my mom isn't.
- I know your mom.

16:48.939 --> 16:50.601
I bet she was real tough on you.

16:50.602 --> 16:52.328
Oh, no, she gave me everything I wanted,

16:52.329 --> 16:53.581
never yelled at me,

16:53.582 --> 16:55.859
let me eat ice cream for
breakfast and dinner.

16:58.227 --> 17:01.278
So your mom made you into
the person you are today?

17:01.280 --> 17:03.344
Without her constant love and support,

17:03.345 --> 17:05.531
I think I would've turned
out pretty different.

17:05.531 --> 17:07.432
Mm, I bet you would have.

17:09.134 --> 17:11.134
Thank you, Horace.

17:11.135 --> 17:12.804
This has been very helpful.

17:12.805 --> 17:15.031
Do you have a piece of paper?
I want to write Eddie a note.

17:15.039 --> 17:17.964
No, but you want to scratch on
the wall? That's what I do.

17:24.550 --> 17:26.631
Mind if I cut in, amigo?

17:26.632 --> 17:28.713
Dad, what are you doing? You
don't know any of the steps.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.518
I'm the former Cha Cha King of Taipei.

17:30.519 --> 17:31.800
I don't need the steps.

17:34.643 --> 17:37.178
Sorry if I made a big deal out
of you playing volleyball.

17:38.068 --> 17:40.441
I'm sorry I lied about
it. I know you love it.

17:41.035 --> 17:43.484
- Well...
- You don't love it?

17:44.199 --> 17:46.278
I was pretending to love it
'cause I thought you loved it.

17:46.280 --> 17:47.800
I was trying to connect with you.

17:47.801 --> 17:49.941
So you don't know who Yoko
Zetterlund is, either.

17:49.942 --> 17:51.573
Nobody does, son.

17:54.060 --> 17:55.937
You didn't have to hide this from me.

17:55.938 --> 17:58.099
If you want to be a
professional line dancer,

17:58.100 --> 17:59.484
your mom and I will support you.

17:59.485 --> 18:00.851
Relax, Dad. I don't.

18:00.852 --> 18:02.023
Oh, thank God.

18:02.024 --> 18:03.721
Your mother would've murdered us both.

18:05.290 --> 18:06.684
Line dancing is fun and everything,

18:06.685 --> 18:08.503
but the truth is, everyone treats me

18:08.504 --> 18:09.671
like I've got it all figured out,

18:09.672 --> 18:11.007
but I don't.

18:11.008 --> 18:12.561
So I'm trying out different Emerys,

18:12.563 --> 18:14.755
- and that's hard to do when you...
- Spatch your spike?

18:14.756 --> 18:16.234
I don't know what that means.

18:16.235 --> 18:17.451
Neither do I.

18:17.452 --> 18:20.307
I guess I can come on a
little strong sometimes.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.373
I just want to make
sure I'm there for you.

18:22.374 --> 18:24.173
- Mind if I cut i...
- Back off, Shania.

18:24.174 --> 18:26.022
I'm talking to my son.

18:27.079 --> 18:28.832
I love that you're trying
to connect with me,

18:28.833 --> 18:30.898
but it adds a lot of pressure.

18:30.899 --> 18:32.483
I just need some space sometimes.

18:32.484 --> 18:33.868
I get it.

18:33.869 --> 18:35.253
And I'll be here when you need me.

18:41.443 --> 18:44.112
Leroy, you fix a mean Shirley Temple.

18:46.449 --> 18:47.925
Mom, where's Dad?

18:47.926 --> 18:49.678
Horace said he was attacked
by a bunch of bees!

18:49.679 --> 18:50.764
Your dad's fine.

18:50.765 --> 18:52.632
That was just a clever
ploy to get you home.

18:54.105 --> 18:56.090
There's something I want to tell you.

18:56.091 --> 18:58.705
What? You're right and I'm
wrong? I've heard it before.

18:58.706 --> 18:59.994
No.

19:01.965 --> 19:04.662
I was scared I'd pushed you away.

19:04.663 --> 19:07.422
But after talking to Horace,
I realized I hadn't.

19:07.423 --> 19:10.638
I pushed you out. Ew. Gross, Mom.

19:10.639 --> 19:12.041
Ew, not like that!

19:12.042 --> 19:13.847
Pushed you out of the nest.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.382
Which is my job as your mom.

19:16.383 --> 19:18.579
And as usual, I was too good at it,

19:18.580 --> 19:20.121
and now you're ready early.

19:20.122 --> 19:21.365
So you're welcome.

19:21.366 --> 19:22.418
Thank you.

19:22.419 --> 19:23.701
Wait, for what?

19:23.702 --> 19:25.892
Well, you could've had Horace's mom...

19:25.893 --> 19:28.889
A nice mom who gives you hugs

19:28.890 --> 19:30.424
and lets you eat ice cream for dinner.

19:30.425 --> 19:32.543
But instead, you got me,
and because of that,

19:32.544 --> 19:34.195
you know how to take care of yourself.

19:35.297 --> 19:36.717
I'm sorry I ran away.

19:37.368 --> 19:40.526
If it's any consolation,
Horace's apartment sucked.

19:40.528 --> 19:42.045
Everything was covered in cat hair,

19:42.047 --> 19:43.493
and he doesn't even own a cat.

19:44.670 --> 19:47.058
Oh, I almost forgot.

19:47.059 --> 19:49.343
I need you to move the
computer into my room.

19:49.344 --> 19:51.362
What?! But you don't even use it!

19:52.455 --> 19:53.908
I guess I'll have to learn.

19:54.749 --> 19:57.118
We'll have to keep in
touch somehow, right?

19:59.134 --> 20:00.233
Wait...

20:00.235 --> 20:02.038
so I can go on the Cultural
Exchange to Taiwan?

20:02.040 --> 20:03.858
Fine.

20:06.108 --> 20:08.326
Hey, this will be nice for me, too.

20:08.328 --> 20:11.315
I look forward to being
bumped down to part-time mom.

20:11.316 --> 20:13.017
So, what are you gonna do
with all your free time?

20:13.018 --> 20:16.254
Oh, I'm sure I'll find
someone else to boss around.

20:22.401 --> 20:23.701
Mom?!

20:23.703 --> 20:25.134
It's 3:00 in the morning.

20:27.486 --> 20:29.070
I have a problem.

20:38.659 --> 20:39.819
You'll stop cleaning

20:39.820 --> 20:43.701
when I tell you to stop
cleaning, Robot Louis!

20:44.928 --> 20:47.652
- That's my favorite game.
- Pretty cool, right?

20:49.041 --> 20:51.174
Hey, wait. Where's grandma?

20:51.175 --> 20:53.175
Oh, she's around.

20:53.177 --> 20:58.133
