WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:05.973
THIS Q&A I DID
AT THE LAW SCHOOL?

00:06.040 --> 00:07.441
IT WENT LONG.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.878
WHAT'D THE FUTURE SCUMBAGS
OF AMERICA WANT TO KNOW ABOUT?

00:10.944 --> 00:13.081
MOSTLY
SEARCH-AND-SEIZURE RULES.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.083
DID YOU DEMONSTRATE
ON THE COEDS?

00:15.149 --> 00:16.884
Come on.
They were all too young.

00:16.950 --> 00:19.120
Too young for you,
but not for me.

00:19.187 --> 00:21.122
My cutoff is 25, buddy.

00:21.189 --> 00:25.193
So, how much you get paid
for a lecture gig like this?

00:25.259 --> 00:27.261
OH, I GOT
SOME GREAT GIFTS --

00:27.328 --> 00:28.629
A T-SHIRT,
A COFFEE MUG...

00:28.696 --> 00:30.931
and the professor's
phone number.

00:30.998 --> 00:32.500
YEAH?
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.068
Oh, very funny.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.203
ANYWAY...

00:37.338 --> 00:39.873
So, are you still gonna
pick me up tomorrow?

00:39.940 --> 00:41.875
OH, MY GOD!

00:41.942 --> 00:42.910
FLYNN?

01:04.965 --> 01:06.934
ANDY! ANDY!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.702
WHAT THE HELL?!
WHAT HAPPENED?!

01:08.769 --> 01:11.639
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT!
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT!

01:11.705 --> 01:12.840
Are you hurt?

01:12.906 --> 01:15.443
NO, NO. I'M FINE.
LISTEN, GET AN AMBULANCE.

01:15.509 --> 01:17.711
SOUTH SIDE OF BEVERLY,
JUST EAST OF MARTEL!

01:17.778 --> 01:19.447
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.922
DON'T MOVE, SWEETHEART.
HELP IS ON THE WAY, OKAY?

01:28.989 --> 01:30.491
MY DAD'S GONNA BE SO MAD.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.826
HE DIDN'T WANT ME
TO RIDE THE BIKE.

01:32.893 --> 01:35.129
TELL ME YOUR NAME.
GRACEY.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.697
OKAY, GRACEY,

01:36.764 --> 01:40.201
DID YOU SEE THE DRIVER
OF THE CAR THAT HIT YOU?

01:40.268 --> 01:42.236
ALL I SAW
WERE HEADLIGHTS.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.839
I...I-I THINK I'M OKAY.
I'M GOOD.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.610
I DON'T FEEL ANYTHING.
JUST HELP ME UP.
NO, NO, NO.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.845
YOU -- YOU JUST LIE THERE,
OKAY?

01:51.912 --> 01:53.781
AN AMBULANCE IS ON THE WAY.

01:53.847 --> 01:57.117
I'M SO SORRY TO CAUSE YOU
ALL THIS TROUBLE.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.720
I REALLY THINK I'M OKAY.

02:01.455 --> 02:04.292
LISTEN -- LISTEN, SWEETHEART,
IT'S NO TROUBLE AT ALL.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.860
YOU WERE IN AN ACCIDENT.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.363
HEY, YOU'RE A CHAMP,
GRACEY.

02:09.430 --> 02:11.165
YOU'RE A CHAMP.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.667
YEAH, YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.869
YOU'RE DOING GOOD,
SWEETHEART.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.906
YOU'RE DOING GOOD.

02:22.710 --> 02:24.312
GRACEY, DON'T...

02:45.533 --> 02:47.034
OH, MY GOD.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.636
OH, MY GOD.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.871
OH, NO!

02:50.938 --> 02:54.342
OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD.

02:54.408 --> 02:56.744
OH, MY GOD!

02:56.810 --> 02:58.746
OH, MY GOD.

02:58.812 --> 03:01.515
OH, NO!

03:13.126 --> 03:15.263
OH. OH.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.324
I-I'M SORRY. I-I THINK I MAY
HAVE LEFT MY PURSE HERE.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.326
GAIL!
I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

03:45.393 --> 03:47.328
WELL, I THOUGHT
I HAD, TOO.

03:47.395 --> 03:49.330
I CAN'T FIND MY CAR.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.332
I THINK
IT'S BEEN STOLEN.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.100
OH, NOT THE MERCEDES.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.668
OH, NO,
THIS IS AWFUL.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.470
MY CAR, PURSE...

03:56.537 --> 04:00.574
THE PHONE,
THE CREDIT CARDS, EVERYTHING.

04:00.641 --> 04:04.345
YOU SHOULD HAVE VALETED.
I COULD HAVE VALETED!

04:04.412 --> 04:05.713
I'LL CALL THE POLICE.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.248
SHALL I TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE?
NO, NO.

04:08.316 --> 04:09.550
YES.
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.685
YES.
WELL, YES, MAYBE...

04:11.752 --> 04:14.221
IF YOU THINK IT'LL MOVE THINGS
ALONG FASTER.

04:14.288 --> 04:16.223
WOULD YOU LOOK AT ME?

04:16.290 --> 04:18.992
MY HANDS ARE SHAKING.
OH, YOU POOR BABY.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.429
LET'S GET YOU A DRINK.
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.263
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:23.331 --> 04:28.101
I THINK I'LL HAVE SOMETHING
WITH VODKA, PLEASE?

04:28.168 --> 04:29.670
RIGHT AWAY.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.391
Kelly: MOM?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.826
HEY, MOM, IS THAT YOU?

04:52.893 --> 04:54.562
HI, HONEY.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.797
I'M SORRY I'M LATE.

04:56.864 --> 04:58.599
I-I WOULD HAVE CALLED,

04:58.666 --> 05:01.635
BUT SOMEBODY
STOLE MY PURSE.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.206
SOMEBODY STOLE IT,
OR YOU LEFT IT SOMEWHERE?

05:06.273 --> 05:09.777
NO, THIS TIME,
SOMEONE ACTUALLY TOOK IT.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.480
AND THEY
TOOK MY CAR, TOO.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.047
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

05:14.114 --> 05:16.650
MOM,
DO YOU REALLY NEED THAT?

05:16.717 --> 05:20.287
AFTER THE NIGHT I HAVE HAD,
YES, MOMMY NEEDS A NIGHTCAP.

05:20.354 --> 05:22.623
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU DIDN'T DRIVE HOME.

05:22.690 --> 05:25.258
NO. YOUR DAD'S BOYS IN BLUE

05:25.325 --> 05:27.060
BROUGHT ME
RIGHT TO THE FRONT DOOR,

05:27.127 --> 05:30.864
ONLY TOO HAPPY TO HELP
THE POLICE COMMISSIONER'S WIFE.

05:30.931 --> 05:34.502
OH, GO BACK TO BED.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.069
I'M JUST GONNA...

05:36.136 --> 05:38.071
SIT FOR A WHILE.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.106
OKAY.

06:03.931 --> 06:06.934
OH, OH.
GOOD MORNING, MRS. MYERS.
GOOD MORNING.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.203
UH, LIEUTENANT PROVENZA,
UH, LIEUTENANT FLYNN, L.A.P.D.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.306
OH, MY GOD. DON'T TELL ME
YOU'VE ALREADY FOUND MY
MERCEDES.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.308
NO, NO,
BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.278
I KNOW IT'S AN IMPOSITION,

06:18.345 --> 06:21.549
CHIEF POPE ASKED
IF YOU'D COME DOWNTOWN
TO LOOK AT SOME PHOTOS

06:21.615 --> 06:23.984
OF PEOPLE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AT THE RESTAURANT.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.454
WOW, YOU GUYS
ARE REALLY ON IT.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.456
COME IN, COME IN.
WELL, THANK YOU.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.957
YES, THANK YOU.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.959
RIGHT THIS WAY,
MRS. MYERS.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.261
THIS IS THE HEART OF
MAJOR CRIMES DIVISION,

06:34.327 --> 06:36.263
OR WHAT WE CALL
"THE MURDER ROOM."

06:36.329 --> 06:37.831
AND RIGHT OVER HERE,

06:37.898 --> 06:40.768
WE'RE TRYING TO REASSEMBLE
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.437
OF COURSE, WE'RE, UH,
SURVEILLING ALL KNOWN CHOP SHOPS

06:43.504 --> 06:46.707
AND HIGH-END RESALE DEALERS
IN THE AREA,
BUT YOU SHOULD BE PREPARED.

06:46.774 --> 06:49.543
A LOT OF THESE CARS JUST GO
STRAIGHT OVER THE BORDER.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.111
Taylor: HERE YOU ARE.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.147
MRS. MYERS, ALLOW ME TO
INTRODUCE DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

06:54.214 --> 06:57.585
DETECTIVE GABRIEL,
AND THAT'S LIEUTENANT TAO
OVER THERE.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.086
MRS. MYERS.
IT'S A PLEASURE, MA'AM.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.254
MA'AM, THESE ARE KNOWN
CAR THIEVES AND PAROLEES

07:01.321 --> 07:03.891
WHO LIVE WITHIN 2-MILES
OF WHERE YOU PARKED YOUR CAR.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.593
IF ANYBODY LOOKS FAMILIAR,
JUST POINT.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.628
Gabriel: YEAH,
WE RAN ALL THE DMV PHOTOS

07:07.695 --> 07:10.063
AND GREEN-CARD I.D.s
OF ALL THE KITCHEN WORKERS,

07:10.130 --> 07:12.600
BAR STAFF, AND WAITERS
AT LA "BON-NE" AMI.

07:12.666 --> 07:14.367
LA BONNE AMI.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.604
Tao: WE WRANGLED THE RESERVATION
LIST AND SEATING CHART

07:16.670 --> 07:20.407
FROM LA BONNE AMI,
UH, EARLY THIS MORNING
FROM THE MAÃ®TRE D'.

07:20.474 --> 07:24.144
I'M CROSSCHECKING
THE FOOD AND DRINK TABS
WITH CREDIT-CARD CHARGES,

07:24.211 --> 07:26.747
TRACKING DOWN WHO HAD BEEN
SEATED CLOSE TO YOUR TABLE.

07:26.814 --> 07:30.217
Gabriel: SOMEBODY COULD'VE
WATCHED YOU PARK
AND THEN FOLLOWED YOU INSIDE.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.487
MY GOD. I JUST HOPE
THAT YOU'RE NOT
DOING ALL OF THIS

07:33.554 --> 07:36.289
JUST BECAUSE I'M
A POLICE COMMISSIONER'S WIFE.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.860
WELL, NOT ALL OF IT.
WE'VE ONLY HAD
TWO CARS STOLEN

07:39.927 --> 07:41.862
FROM THAT NEIGHBORHOOD
ALL YEAR.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.498
WE DON'T WANT THIS
TO START A TREND.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.870
PLEASE, IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND
HANGING HERE FOR A SECOND.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.872
WE'RE GONNA SEND
CHIEF JOHNSON IN

07:51.939 --> 07:54.007
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S RIGHT
WITH YOUR INSURANCE.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.409
UH, DO YOU
HAVE ENOUGH COFFEE?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.612
UH, YES. THANK YOU.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.873
HELLO, HELLO.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.576
I'M SO SORRY TO HAVE KEPT YOU
WAITING, MRS. MYERS.

08:28.642 --> 08:30.744
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

08:30.811 --> 08:34.381
WE'VE MET ONCE BEFORE,
BUT YOU PROBABLY DON'T REMEMBER.

08:34.447 --> 08:36.183
YOU AND, UH,
COMMISSIONER MYERS

08:36.249 --> 08:40.053
HOSTED A COCKTAIL PARTY
AT YOUR HOUSE FOR CHIEF POPE.

08:40.120 --> 08:41.855
SUCH A NICE HOUSE.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.124
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR CAR.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.027
I'VE NEVER HAD MINE STOLEN --
OR MY PURSE, FOR THAT MATTER,

08:47.094 --> 08:49.963
WHICH, FOR ME,
WOULD BE MUCH WORSE.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.465
I KEEP EVERYTHING
IN THAT PURSE -- EVERYTHING.

08:52.532 --> 08:53.967
WHICH REMINDS ME --

08:54.034 --> 08:57.270
IS THERE A REASON YOU HAVEN'T
CANCELED YOUR CREDIT CARDS?

08:59.840 --> 09:02.209
YOU KNOW,
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

09:02.275 --> 09:04.678
WELL, YOU SHOULD
GET ON IT RIGHT AWAY.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.680
AS YOUR HUSBAND
WOULD TELL YOU,

09:06.747 --> 09:08.716
TO HAVE YOUR CAR STOLEN
IS ONE THING,

09:08.782 --> 09:12.285
BUT IDENTITY THEFT
IS MUCH WORSE.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.354
SO, I KNOW
THAT YOU MUST BE...

09:14.421 --> 09:17.758
SICK OF, UH, GOING OVER
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

09:17.825 --> 09:22.930
BUT IT IS CRUCIAL THAT I GET
THE DETAILS DIRECTLY FROM YOU.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.734
OKAY. I WENT OUT TO DINNER
WITH MY DAUGHTER

09:26.800 --> 09:30.203
AND HER TWO BEST FRIENDS
FROM THE MARLBOROUGH ACADEMY

09:30.270 --> 09:31.872
AND THEIR MOTHERS.

09:31.939 --> 09:36.376
UM, AFTER DINNER, I NOTICED
MY PURSE WAS MISSING.

09:36.443 --> 09:39.079
RIGHT. YOU, UH -- YOU TOLD
THE RESPONDING OFFICERS

09:39.146 --> 09:43.116
THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE
LEFT IT IN THE LADIES' ROOM?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.118
HONESTLY,
I DON'T REMEMBER.

09:45.185 --> 09:48.521
I ACTUALLY WALKED OUT
OF THE RESTAURANT,

09:48.588 --> 09:52.592
THINKING I MIGHT HAVE STILL
LEFT THE PURSE IN THE CAR.

09:52.660 --> 09:55.428
BUT THE CAR WAS GONE.
THEN WHAT?

09:55.495 --> 09:58.065
UH...I WALKED BACK INSIDE,

09:58.131 --> 10:01.168
AND THE MANAGER
CALLED THE POLICE.

10:01.234 --> 10:04.905
WELL, WE MAY HAVE MORE
INFORMATION TO ADD TO THAT.

10:04.972 --> 10:08.308
UM...YOU SEE, MRS. MYERS,
UM...

10:08.375 --> 10:10.377
LAST NIGHT,
THERE WAS A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT

10:10.443 --> 10:13.280
AROUND THE TIME
THAT YOUR CAR WENT MISSING.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.350
A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL WAS KILLED
IN A HIT-AND-RUN.

10:19.086 --> 10:22.022
OH, MY GOD.

10:22.089 --> 10:26.660
WE HAVE SEVERAL WITNESSES
DESCRIBING A MERCEDES
EXACTLY LIKE YOURS.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.696
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.263
I WISH I WAS.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.102
HER NAME
WAS GRACEY ANN GATES.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.872
SHE WAS A FRESHMAN
IN COLLEGE.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.408
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO TAKE
HER LAST FINAL THIS MORNING

10:41.474 --> 10:45.478
AND THEN FLY HOME TO BE
WITH HER FAMILY FOR CHRISTMAS.

10:45.545 --> 10:49.683
AND YOU THINK THE PERSON
THAT STOLE MY CAR RAN HER DOWN?

10:49.750 --> 10:52.953
WELL,
THE HIT-AND-RUN HAPPENED

10:53.020 --> 10:55.188
HALF A MILE FROM THE RESTAURANT
WHERE YOU WERE,

10:55.255 --> 10:57.791
SO IT DOES FIT
INTO OUR TIMELINE.

10:57.858 --> 11:02.062
OH, NO WONDER YOU'RE WORKING
SO HARD TO FIND THE CAR.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.832
WHAT CAN I DO?
HOW CAN I HELP?

11:04.898 --> 11:08.001
CAN I OFFER A REWARD?
I WANT TO HELP.

11:08.068 --> 11:12.572
YOU ARE HELPING US RIGHT NOW,
AND WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE IT.

11:12.639 --> 11:15.008
OH, GOD.
I WISH I HAD PAID
MORE ATTENTION

11:15.075 --> 11:17.144
TO THE PEOPLE AROUND ME
LAST NIGHT.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.981
I WISH THAT I HAD KEPT
MY DAMN PURSE IN MY HAND.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.183
I WISH THAT I HADN'T...

11:24.617 --> 11:26.119
HADN'T WHAT?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.193
I WISH I HADN'T PARKED
ON THE STREET.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.228
AND MAYBE MY CAR
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN STOLEN,

11:35.295 --> 11:37.430
AND THIS POOR GIRL
WOULDN'T BE...

11:42.535 --> 11:44.471
I'M SORRY.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.106
I'M SORRY.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.044
I KNOW HOW UNSETTLING
ALL THIS MUST FEEL, MRS. MYERS,

11:51.111 --> 11:55.048
BUT I PROMISE YOU
THAT WE WILL NOT STOP
UNTIL WE FIND THE PERSON

11:55.115 --> 11:57.650
WHO KILLED THAT YOUNG GIRL
WITH YOUR CAR.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.988
AND IF YOU REMEMBER
ANYTHING AT ALL ABOUT
WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED

12:01.054 --> 12:03.023
TO YOUR PURSE, PLEASE DON'T
HESITATE TO CALL.

12:03.090 --> 12:05.058
Pope:
WHEN DOES JAY GET IN?

12:05.125 --> 12:08.528
I WANT TO KEEP HIM UP TO SPEED.
UM, HE FLIES IN LATE TONIGHT.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.065
I'LL CALL HIS OFFICE
AND SET UP A BRIEFING
FOR FIRST THING TOMORROW.

12:12.132 --> 12:16.169
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW JUST
AS SOON AS WE FIND YOUR CAR.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.872
UM, PLEASE, PLEASE
GIVE MY CONDOLENCES

12:18.939 --> 12:20.874
TO THAT
POOR GIRL'S FAMILY

12:20.941 --> 12:24.044
AND TELL THEM THEY ARE
IN MY FAMILY'S PRAYERS.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.881
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.449
THANK YOU.

12:36.023 --> 12:39.927
WHAT...A...LIAR.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.298
FOR THE SAKE
OF YOUR CAREER --
AND MINE --

12:45.365 --> 12:48.035
DON'T TELL PEOPLE A POLICE
COMMISSIONER'S WIFE IS A LIAR

12:48.101 --> 12:49.569
UNLESS YOU CAN PROVE IT.

12:49.636 --> 12:52.840
DID YOU SEE HER EYES
WHEN I TOLD HER
ABOUT THE VICTIM?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.875
I SAW TEARS.
I'D BE CRYING, TOO,

12:54.942 --> 12:57.744
IF I SIDE-SWIPED A 19-YEAR-OLD
GIRL AND DROVE AWAY.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.779
ONLY, I'D COME UP
WITH A BETTER EXCUSE

12:59.847 --> 13:01.581
THAN, "OH,
SOMEONE STOLE MY PURSE!"

13:01.648 --> 13:04.184
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER
DOWN THIS GAIL MYERS ROAD,

13:04.251 --> 13:08.688
LET ME POINT OUT TO YOU,
WHEN YOU AIM AT A POLICE
COMMISSIONER'S WIFE AND MISS,

13:08.755 --> 13:09.857
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.158
WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES

13:11.224 --> 13:13.060
OF LETTING SOMEONE
GET AWAY WITH MURDER?

13:13.126 --> 13:15.128
MUR-- THIS IS NOT MURDER.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.197
THIS IS MAYBE
VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER.

13:17.264 --> 13:19.432
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO MADE
HIT-AND-RUN A MAJOR CRIME.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.468
USUALLY, DEATHS LIKE THESE
ARE HANDLED BY TRAFFIC.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.938
YEAH, YEAH. I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
IF I GAVE YOU A STOLEN CAR,

13:25.005 --> 13:26.940
YOU'D TURN IT
INTO A HOMICIDE.

13:27.007 --> 13:29.276
LOOK, THE OFFICERS
THAT DROVE HER HOME

13:29.342 --> 13:31.378
SAID MRS. MYERS
REEKED OF ALCOHOL.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.513
THAT WASN'T
IN THEIR REPORT.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.683
BECAUSE SHE'S
A POLICE COMMISSIONER'S WIFE.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.151
WOW.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.954
ALRIGHT, HERE, LET'S, UH --
LET'S LOOK AT THE LOGISTICS.

13:41.021 --> 13:44.892
UH, PROVENZA CALLED 911
AT 11:27.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.395
STOLEN-VEHICLE REPORT WAS TAKEN
AT 11:41.

13:48.461 --> 13:51.364
SO, HOW DID SHE STEAL
HER OWN CAR,

13:51.431 --> 13:53.600
COMMIT MANSLAUGHTER,
DITCH ALL THAT STUFF,

13:53.666 --> 13:56.436
AND GET BACK TO THE BAR
IN LIKE 14 MINUTES?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.138
I DON'T KNOW YET.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.474
WHY WAS SHE DRIVING IN THE EXACT
OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF HER HOUSE?

14:01.541 --> 14:03.710
I DON'T KNOW YET.
YOU BETTER FIGURE THAT OUT,

14:03.776 --> 14:06.846
BECAUSE THE HIT-AND-RUN DRIVER
WAS IN THE WESTBOUND LANE,

14:06.914 --> 14:08.982
AND GAIL MYERS' HOUSE
IS EAST OF THERE.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.218
THE DRIVER DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT LANE THEY WERE IN.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.253
THEY SWERVED
ACROSS THE LINE,

14:13.320 --> 14:15.255
PROBABLY BECAUSE
SHE'D BEEN DRINKING.

14:15.322 --> 14:19.159
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LATE TO
ADMINISTER A BREATHALYZER TEST.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.929
AND, LOOK, IF WE ARE
SERIOUSLY GOING AFTER

14:21.995 --> 14:23.964
A POLICE COMMISSIONER'S
WIFE HERE --

14:24.031 --> 14:25.832
AND BY "WE,"
I DO MEAN YOU --

14:25.899 --> 14:29.169
WHAT DO I TELL THE COMMISSIONER
WHEN HE CALLS FOR A REPORT?

14:29.236 --> 14:31.071
TELL HIM WE'RE DOING
A BLOCK-BY-BLOCK,

14:31.138 --> 14:35.475
INCH-BY-INCH GRID SEARCH
TO FIND HIS WIFE'S PURSE
AND, WE'RE LUCKY, HER CAR.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.277
LOVE IT. WHAT ELSE?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.546
WE'RE KNOCKING ON DOORS,
LOOKING FOR WITNESSES.

14:39.612 --> 14:40.914
LOVE IT. WHAT ELSE?

14:43.516 --> 14:46.719
WE MIGHT AS WELL LOOK
AND SEE IF THERE ARE
ANY ACCIDENT REPORTS

14:46.786 --> 14:49.622
WHERE SOMEONE LOST A MIRROR
OFF THEIR NEW MERCEDES.

14:49.689 --> 14:50.723
OKAY.

14:50.790 --> 14:53.126
AND, UM,
GRACEY'S PARENTS ARE,

14:53.193 --> 14:56.129
FLYING IN FROM COLORADO
TO CLAIM THEIR DAUGHTER'S BODY.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.631
THEY'VE ALSO ASKED TO VISIT
THE SCENE WHERE SHE DIED.

14:58.698 --> 15:02.402
SO, WOULD YOU MIND TALKING
TO THEM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

15:02.469 --> 15:05.105
SURE, SURE.

15:05.172 --> 15:07.340
YOU KNOW I'M REQUIRED
BY THE RULES AROUND HERE

15:07.407 --> 15:09.109
AND THE CIRCUMSTANCES
OF GRACEY'S DEATH

15:09.176 --> 15:11.544
TO ASK YOU IF YOU WANT
TO SEE A COUNSELOR...

15:11.611 --> 15:13.680
ABOUT THE EMOTIONAL
FALLOUT.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.750
I-I'M FINE, CHIEF.
I'VE ALREADY BEEN ON THE PHONE
WITH MY SPONSOR.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.319
GOOD, THEN. GOOD.

15:19.386 --> 15:22.355
UH, LOOK, COULD YOU QUIETLY --
AND I MEAN ON TIPPY-TOES --

15:22.422 --> 15:25.525
LOOK INTO GAIL MYERS' BACKGROUND
FOR ME, PLEASE?

15:25.592 --> 15:28.661
SHE HAS NO DUIs IN CALIFORNIA.
IT'S A BIG COUNTRY.

15:28.728 --> 15:33.133
SEE IF SHE HAS A SPARE GARAGE
OR A FRIEND WITH ONE SOMEWHERE
NEAR THE RESTAURANT. HELLO?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.668
HI. HEY, CHIEF,
WE'RE MAKING HEADWAY.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.804
UH, MRS. MYERS' WALLET
WAS IN A GUTTER

15:37.870 --> 15:40.573
THREE BLOCKS FROM THE OOH-LA-LA
FRENCH RESTAURANT

15:40.640 --> 15:42.575
WHERE SHE BOOZED IT UP
LAST NIGHT.

15:42.642 --> 15:46.013
AND WE GOT HER CELLPHONE, TOO.
LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY RAN OVER IT.

15:46.079 --> 15:48.915
GREAT. FIND ME THE CAR,
AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.283
THANK YOU.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.086
YES, BUZZ.
I THINK I HAVE THIS STRAIGHT.

15:53.153 --> 15:55.255
MRS. MYERS' DAUGHTER'S
BEST FRIEND'S STEPMOTHER

15:55.322 --> 15:57.724
IS IN INTERVIEW 2
WITH DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.292
GREAT. THANK YOU.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.764
QUIETLY, LIEUTENANT.

16:04.831 --> 16:07.367
AS THE GRAVE, CHIEF.
AS THE GRAVE.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.208
IT DOESN'T SURPRISE ME
THAT SOMEBODY STOLE THAT CAR.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.011
IT SHOCKS ME
THAT GAIL DIDN'T VALET.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.813
I ALWAYS, ALWAYS
VALET MY MERCEDES.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.749
ONE REALLY MUST.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.717
MM. SO, DO YOU RECOGNIZE

16:24.784 --> 16:26.919
ANYONE FROM THE RESTAURANT
LAST NIGHT?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.222
OH, FIRST OF ALL,
I HATE THAT PLACE.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.459
IT'S JUST FILLED
WITH PRETENTIOUS ASSHOLES.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.562
YOU KNOW, I TEND NOT
TO NOTICE THE STAFF,

16:35.628 --> 16:36.796
BECAUSE HONESTLY,

16:36.863 --> 16:38.865
IF YOU'VE SEEN ONE BUSBOY
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,

16:38.931 --> 16:41.734
YOU'VE SEEN 'EM ALL --
IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN --

16:41.801 --> 16:44.604
'CAUSE THEY JUST -- WELL,
THEY PRETTY MUCH LOOK ALIKE.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.274
SO, WERE THE GIRLS WITH Y'ALL
THE WHOLE EVENING?

16:47.340 --> 16:48.608
GOD, NO.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.677
NO, THEY USED TO
STAY ALL NIGHT,

16:50.743 --> 16:53.646
BUT, UH, WHEN THEY GOT
THEIR DRIVER'S LICENSES,

16:53.713 --> 16:57.250
OUR LITTLE GIRLS DECIDED
WE WERE OLD AND BORING.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.519
SO KELLY AND KAITLIN LEFT
ABOUT -- I DON'T KNOW --

16:59.586 --> 17:03.190
10:00, 10:30.
AND GAIL AND I STAYED
AND POLISHED OFF THE WINE.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.991
OH, THIS IS SO HELPFUL.

17:05.058 --> 17:08.695
MRS. MYERS SAID SHE HAD
A FEW TOO MANY, HER MEMORY'S
A LITTLE FUZZY.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.898
MM. REALLY? HA!
BECAUSE THAT GAL
CAN PUT IT AWAY.

17:11.964 --> 17:14.401
SHE'S LIKE ONE OF THOSE
HOLLOW

17:14.467 --> 17:17.504
NOT ME.
TWO CHABLIS, AND I'M
THREE SHEETS TO THE WIND.

17:17.570 --> 17:21.174
SO, UM, YOU WERE SAYING
THAT, UH, AFTER
THE GIRLS LEFT...?

17:21.241 --> 17:23.976
OH, I RAN INTO MY FRIEND
VERONICA FROM QUEENS,

17:24.043 --> 17:29.516
I HAD A CUP OF COFFEE WITH "V."
GAIL LEFT, AND THEN,
YOU KNOW, SHE CAME BACK.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.119
SHE SHOULD HAVE VALETED.
MM-HMM.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.454
SO, HOW MUCH TIME WAS THAT,
DO YOU THINK,

17:34.521 --> 17:37.290
BETWEEN WHEN GAIL LEFT
AND THEN CAME BACK TO THE BAR?

17:37.357 --> 17:41.094
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
YOU KNOW,
A CUP OF COFFEE'S WORTH.

17:41.161 --> 17:43.263
SO, GAIL CAME BACK,
THE POLICE WERE CALLED,

17:43.330 --> 17:45.465
AND Y'ALL
HAD ANOTHER DRINK?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.504
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU SHOULD ASK
GAIL WHAT SHE WAS DRINKING,

17:51.571 --> 17:54.707
BECAUSE I-I MONITOR MY ALCOHOL
INTAKE AND MY HUSBAND'S,

17:54.774 --> 17:59.612
BUT, UM, YEAH, I DON'T KEEP TABS
ON -- ON OTHER PEOPLE.

17:59.679 --> 18:03.683
THE REASON WE NEED TO BE SO
CRYSTAL CLEAR ABOUT THE DETAILS

18:03.750 --> 18:05.685
IS THAT WHOEVER STOLE
YOUR FRIEND'S CAR

18:05.752 --> 18:07.687
DROVE IT OVER
A 19-YEAR-OLD GIRL,

18:07.754 --> 18:10.657
KILLED HER,
AND FLED THE SCENE.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.826
OH, MY GOD.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

18:15.362 --> 18:17.230
THAT'S JUST AWFUL.
ELECTRONICS. BUZZ SPEAKING.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.099
PROVENZA:
Yeah, it's Provenza. Tell the
chief we found the Mercedes.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.570
NO. IT COULDN'T BE
GAIL,
BECAUSE WHEN SHE CAME BACK
TO THE RESTAURANT,

18:23.636 --> 18:26.239
SHE WENT TO THE MANAGER
TO CALL THE POLICE.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.275
SO, I MEAN,
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

18:28.341 --> 18:31.110
WHY WOULD SHE CALL THE POLICE
ON HERSELF?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.681
IT'S HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT,
CHIEF,

18:34.747 --> 18:38.084
PARKED IN AN ALLEY, UH, FIVE,
SIX BLOCKS FROM THE RESTAURANT,

18:38.151 --> 18:40.086
UNLOCKED,
KEY IN THE IGNITION.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.921
I CAN'T BELIEVE
NOBODY CALLED IT IN.

18:41.988 --> 18:45.325
WHO KNOWS YOU FOUND THE CAR?
NOBODY'S HERE BUT US CHICKENS.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.327
GREAT.
HANG ON JUST ONE SECOND.

18:47.394 --> 18:51.398
Well, I can hold on
as long as you like.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.866
AGENT HOWARD. HELLO.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.302
FRITZI...

18:55.368 --> 18:57.103
HONEY, HI.

18:57.170 --> 19:00.773
WE JUST FOUND THE CAR
THAT WAS USED
IN THE HIT-AND-RUN,

19:00.840 --> 19:05.245
AND WE DON'T WANT ANYONE ELSE
AT THE L.A.P.D.
TO KNOW WE HAVE IT.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.347
MAY WE BORROW THE FBI's
PRINT SHED?

19:07.414 --> 19:09.349
E.A.B.?
E.A.B. GREAT.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.117
Thanks.
Love you. Bye.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.453
WELL, I LOVE YOU, TOO,
BUT

19:13.520 --> 19:17.190
$114,000 AUTOMOBILE,
KEYS IN THE IGNITION,

19:17.257 --> 19:19.292
VALUABLES ON THE SEAT,
CASH IN THE ASHTRAY?

19:19.359 --> 19:20.660
WASN'T EVEN LOCKED.

19:20.727 --> 19:23.696
THIS CAR THEFT WAS STAGED,
LIKE HER TEARS.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.766
IT'D BE GREAT
IF YOU COULD PROVE THAT,
YOU KNOW, WITH EVIDENCE.

19:26.833 --> 19:29.602
THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR'S
A MATCH.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.371
GAIL MYERS' STORY
STILL HOLDS.

19:31.438 --> 19:34.106
SOMEBODY STOLE HER CAR,
HIT THE GIRL, DITCHED THE CAR.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.942
OH...
IT'S POSSIBLE.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.177
LIEUTENANT TAO, ARE YOU FINISHED
WITH THE INTERIOR?

19:38.245 --> 19:40.179
WE CAN WORK, UH,
THE OUTSIDE.

19:40.247 --> 19:42.014
THE INSIDE'S ALL YOURS,
CHIEF.
OKAY.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.817
UH, CHIEF POPE, YOU'RE --
YOU'RE GETTING SO TRIM.

19:44.884 --> 19:47.920
WHY DON'T YOU SLIP IN HERE
BEHIND THE WHEEL?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.922
PROVENZA, GET IN THE CAR.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.066
THE SEAT.
Brenda: NO, NO.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.369
DON'T ADJUST ANYTHING, PLEASE.
FRITZI, WOULD YOU --

20:02.435 --> 20:05.204
OKAY, I GET IT. THE SEAT
IS OBVIOUSLY SET LADY SIZE.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.839
CHIEF JOHNSON,
WHY DON'T YOU TRY?

20:06.906 --> 20:09.576
LOVE TO. OH...

20:09.642 --> 20:11.578
OH, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT --

20:11.644 --> 20:15.014
THE MIRRORS ARE SET PERFECTLY
FOR ME.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.819
CLASSICAL-MUSIC STATION.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.220
PLAYING BEETHOVEN --

20:21.288 --> 20:22.655
AS EVERYONE KNOWS,

20:22.722 --> 20:26.259
THE FAVORITE COMPOSER
FOR 9 OUT OF 10 CAR THIEVES.

20:26.326 --> 20:27.827
CONVINCED?

20:27.894 --> 20:29.262
OKAY.

20:29.329 --> 20:31.331
I'M WILLING TO CLIMB
THIS MOUNTAIN WITH YOU,

20:31.398 --> 20:35.234
BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PROVE
GAIL MYERS' CAR WAS NOT STOLEN,

20:35.302 --> 20:39.038
THAT SHE WAS BEHIND THE WHEEL
WHEN GRACEY GATES WAS KILLED,

20:39.105 --> 20:40.573
IF YOU'RE
REALLY CRAZY ENOUGH

20:40.640 --> 20:42.609
TO TRY TO GET HER
ON VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER...

20:42.675 --> 20:44.611
I'M AS NUTTY
AS A FRUITCAKE.

20:44.677 --> 20:47.079
...WE'RE ALSO GONNA
HAVE TO PROVE,
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT,

20:47.146 --> 20:52.385
SHE WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE...
WITHOUT A BLOOD ANALYSIS
OR A FIELD SOBRIETY TEST.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.687
HOW DO YOU PLAN
TO DO THAT?

20:54.754 --> 20:56.689
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.196
YES, LIEUTENANT FLYNN?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.799
HI, CHIEF.
Sorry to be calling so late.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.436
IT'S OKAY. WE'RE UP.
Well, it turns out

21:09.502 --> 21:11.471
THAT THE COMMISSIONER
AND MRS. MYERS

21:11.538 --> 21:14.341
HAVE A VACATION PLACE OUT
IN THE HAMPTONS IN LONG ISLAND.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.443
You know,
a little summer getaway,

21:16.509 --> 21:20.680
8,000 SQUARE FEET, OCEANFRONT,
WORTH ABOUT $12 MILLION.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.382
AND THIS IS RELEVANT
BECAUSE...?

21:22.449 --> 21:24.283
BECAUSE IT SEEMS,
LAST SUMMER,

21:24.351 --> 21:27.454
GAIL MYERS GOT A TICKET
AT 2:15 IN THE MORNING

21:27.520 --> 21:31.090
OUTSIDE A BAR IN SOUTHAMPTON.
A D.U.I.?

21:31.157 --> 21:33.092
HER RECORD
HAS BEEN EXPUNGED.

21:33.159 --> 21:34.727
You know, right about now,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.897
IT WOULD BE REALLY NICE TO HAVE
SOMEONE WITH GOOD CONNECTIONS

21:37.964 --> 21:39.899
TO NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.

21:46.205 --> 21:47.974
YES?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.309
YOU KNOW ANYONE
IN SUFFOLK COUNTY
SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT?

21:50.377 --> 21:52.545
I KNOW PEOPLE IN
THE LONG ISLAND FBI OFFICE.

21:52.612 --> 21:54.947
THEY MAY KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO KNOWS SOMEBODY. WHY?

21:55.014 --> 21:58.818
GAIL MYERS GOT A TICKET
AT 2:00 A.M. OUTSIDE
A BAR IN SOUTHAMPTON.

21:58.885 --> 22:01.854
THEY BURIED IT.
I WANT IT DUG UP.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.557
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE A HARD TIME

22:04.624 --> 22:06.559
PROVING GAIL MYERS
WAS IN THAT VEHICLE,

22:06.626 --> 22:10.296
LET ALONE YOUR VICTIM'S DEATH
BEING A RESULT OF HER ACTIONS.

22:10.363 --> 22:11.831
SHE WAS DRUNK.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.866
SHE KILLED THAT GIRL
AND FLED THE SCENE.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.036
THAT'S VEHICULAR
MANSLAUGHTER, HON.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.771
MAYBE NOT.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.007
WHY MAYBE NOT?

22:21.073 --> 22:24.511
BECAUSE A PREVIOUS D.U.I.
MAKES THIS MURDER.

22:24.577 --> 22:27.346
THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ME
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THAT CAR...

22:28.881 --> 22:31.484
...JUST A LITTLE BEFORE
I MET YOU.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.654
YEAH, BUT YOU DID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEM.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.756
GAIL MYERS NEEDS
AN INTERVENTION.

22:36.823 --> 22:40.593
I'M GONNA GIVE HER ONE.
ALRIGHT.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.430
SINCE SHE'S THE WIFE
OF A POLICE COMMISSIONER,

22:43.496 --> 22:45.432
MIGHT I MAKE A SUGGESTION

22:45.498 --> 22:47.534
AS TO HOW YOU GO ABOUT
QUESTIONING THEM?

22:47.600 --> 22:50.369
WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF
RESOURCES INTO FINDING
YOUR WIFE'S CAR,

22:50.437 --> 22:53.406
AND WE EXPECT TO GET IT BACK.
WE APPRECIATE THAT, WILL,

22:53.473 --> 22:55.207
BUT THE FACT IS, WE'RE FULLY
INSURED.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.844
WE REALIZE THAT YOU'RE REQUIRED
TO LOOK INTO THESE ISSUES,

22:57.910 --> 23:00.379
BUT GRILLING OUR FRIENDS
ABOUT MY WIFE'S DRINKING HABITS?

23:00.447 --> 23:02.081
IT'S REALLY EMBARRASSING.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.050
I-I UNDERSTAND THAT, GAIL.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.085
LOOK, HERE'S THE DEAL.

23:06.152 --> 23:10.356
AS YOU KNOW, WE BELIEVE
A YOUNG WOMAN WAS RUN DOWN
AND KILLED WITH YOUR CAR.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.659
AND YOU SAY
YOU DON'T REMEMBER EXACTLY

23:12.725 --> 23:14.827
WHEN AND HOW YOUR PURSE
WENT MISSING.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.797
AND DETERMINING THAT IS
A BIG PART OF MAKING OUR CASE.

23:17.864 --> 23:20.900
WELL, WE MAY HAVE MADE THIS CASE
FOR YOU ALREADY.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.470
REALLY?
AND HOW DID YOU DO THAT?

23:23.536 --> 23:25.271
OUR DAUGHTER, KELLY,
AND HER FRIENDS

23:25.337 --> 23:29.241
POSTED PICTURES FROM OUR DINNER
ON THEIR FACEBOOK PAGES.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.210
KISS THE CONSTITUTION
GOODBYE.

23:31.277 --> 23:34.280
THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS PRIVACY ANYMORE.
BUT GOOD FOR US BECAUSE...

23:34.346 --> 23:38.084
SEVERAL OF THE PICTURES
SHOW A YOUNG LATINO MAN

23:38.150 --> 23:42.288
WITH TATTOOS ON HIS HANDS
STANDING BEHIND MY CHAIR.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.323
RIGHT THERE.
UH-HUH.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.459
THERE HE IS AGAIN.

23:46.526 --> 23:50.763
MM-HMM. THAT IS MY PURSE STRAP
ON THE BACK OF MY CHAIR.

23:50.830 --> 23:54.934
LET ME JUST, UH --
JUST WRITE SOME OF THIS DOWN.

23:55.001 --> 23:58.437
SO, THE -- THE BUSBOY
WAS AT YOUR TABLE,

23:58.505 --> 24:00.406
AND, UH, GO ON.

24:00.473 --> 24:03.976
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I WENT BACK TO THE RESTAURANT
TO CHECK ON HIM,

24:04.043 --> 24:06.546
AND I HATE TO ACCUSE ANYONE
WITHOUT PROOF,

24:06.613 --> 24:08.648
PARTICULARLY A MINORITY,

24:08.715 --> 24:12.619
BUT THIS GUY DID NOT SHOW UP
FOR WORK YESTERDAY... OR TODAY.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.855
PROBABLY FLED THE COUNTRY BY NOW
IN WHAT'S LEFT OF OUR CAR.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.857
ON HIS EMPLOYMENT
APPLICATION,

24:17.924 --> 24:21.393
THEY HAD HIS NAME
AS JOSE REYES --

24:21.460 --> 24:24.497
R-E-Y-E-S.

24:25.532 --> 24:27.099
THANK YOU.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.503
UH, JAY, WOULD YOU FORWARD
THOSE PICTURES
TO MY E

24:30.570 --> 24:32.805
DONE.

24:32.872 --> 24:34.907
I'D FORWARD THEM
TO, UH, CHIEF JOHNSON,

24:34.974 --> 24:36.943
BUT SHE DOESN'T SEEM
VERY INTERESTED

24:37.009 --> 24:38.945
IN FOLLOWING UP ANYONE
OTHER THAN GAIL.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.748
WELL, I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
WHAT SHE'S LIKE.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.783
I GUESS YOU MUST CONSIDER HER
A VALUABLE ASSET.

24:43.850 --> 24:48.287
STILL, ALL THE LAWSUITS
MAKES YOU WONDER
IF SHE'S REALLY WORTH IT.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.623
NOT REALLY.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.625
GAIL, EXCUSE ME.
UH, BEFORE YOU GO,

24:52.692 --> 24:54.861
IF WE COULD JUST TAKE
ONE MORE CRACK AT,

24:54.927 --> 24:57.697
NAILING DOWN
EXACTLY WHERE AND WHEN
YOUR PURSE WENT MISSING.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.498
YOU HAD IT
IN THE RESTAURANT --

24:59.566 --> 25:02.969
IT'S IN THE PICTURE --
AND YOUR PHONE
AND YOUR KEYS WERE IN IT.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.805
BUT THEN YOU WENT OUT
TO YOUR CAR LOOKING FOR IT.

25:05.872 --> 25:06.973
OBVIOUSLY, SHE PANICKED --

25:07.039 --> 25:08.975
I'M SORRY, JAY,
YOU WEREN'T THERE.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.844
THESE QUESTIONS ARE FOR GAIL.
PLEASE DON'T INTERRUPT ME AGAIN.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.915
YOU SPLIT THE BILL
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

25:15.982 --> 25:19.018
YOUR CREDIT CARD
WAS IN YOUR WALLET.
THE WALLET IN YOUR PURSE.

25:19.085 --> 25:22.521
SO WHY DID YOU GO OUT
TO YOUR CAR LOOKING FOR IT?

25:23.723 --> 25:25.024
WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

25:25.091 --> 25:27.493
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT
WHEN WE FIND THIS BUSBOY,

25:27.560 --> 25:29.796
YOUR VERSION OF THIS THEFT,
AS RELATED --

25:29.862 --> 25:32.665
IT'S GONNA MAKE IT VERY
DIFFICULT TO GET A CONVICTION.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.667
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO BE HELPFUL,

25:34.734 --> 25:36.569
YOU COULD SAY
THAT YOU DON'T REMEMBER

25:36.636 --> 25:40.640
WHERE YOU LEFT YOUR PURSE
BECAUSE YOU WERE
MAYBE A LITTLE DRUNK.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.512
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU FIND
JOSE REYES

25:46.579 --> 25:50.549
AND ASK HIM
WHAT HE WAS HIGH ON.

25:52.018 --> 25:55.254
WELL, THAT IS OUR NEW
NUMBER-ONE PRIORITY, GAIL --

25:55.321 --> 25:58.257
FINDING THE BUSBOY.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.793
OH, AND MAKING SURE THAT
THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY HERE

26:00.860 --> 26:02.595
DOESN'T GET AWAY
BECAUSE A POLICE
COMMISSIONER

26:02.662 --> 26:06.065
WAS TRYING TO THROW
HIS WEIGHT AROUND.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

26:10.637 --> 26:12.504
Brenda: A BUSBOY?

26:12.571 --> 26:15.975
SHE'S PINNING THIS
ON A BUSBOY WITH THE HELP
OF HER DAUGHTER?

26:16.042 --> 26:18.177
MM-HMM.
MAYBE I SHOULD TALK TO KELLY,

26:18.244 --> 26:19.979
SEE WHAT SHE REMEMBERS.

26:20.046 --> 26:23.149
YOU BETTER DO SOMETHING,
'CAUSE I, UH, LOST MY TEMPER
WITH MYERS.

26:23.215 --> 26:26.018
YOU'LL FEEL BETTER
ONCE YOU SEE THIS.

26:26.085 --> 26:28.520
OKAY, BUZZ.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.990
STEP OUT OF THE CAR,
PLEASE.
Gail: WHAT

26:31.057 --> 26:33.125
I NEED YOU TO STEP
OUTSIDE THE VEHICLE.

26:33.192 --> 26:36.428
OKAY, YEAH, YOU WERE WAITING
IN THAT PARKING LOT.
THIS IS ENTRAPMENT.

26:36.495 --> 26:39.065
DO YOU KNOW WHO MY HUSBAND IS?
STEP OVER HERE.

26:39.131 --> 26:41.300
DO YOU KNOW WHO MY HUSBAND IS?
RIGHT NOW.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.336
DO YOU KNOW WHO MY HUSBAND IS?!
STEP RIGHT OVER HERE.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.272
OKAY, I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

26:46.338 --> 26:49.175
WOW. HOW DID SHE GET THAT
EXPUNGED FROM HER RECORD?

26:49.241 --> 26:51.177
DON'T YOU KNOW
WHO HER HUSBAND IS?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.445
SHE PAID A FINE,
TOOK ALCOHOL-AVERSION CLASSES,

26:53.512 --> 26:56.749
MADE A HUGE DONATION
TO COMMUNITY CENTER,
HIRED A VERY GOOD LAWYER.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.584
AND SHE STILL
WENT ON DRINKING.

26:58.651 --> 27:02.755
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF JOHNSON.
THE VICTIM'S PARENTS
ARE ON THEIR WAY UP.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.997
MR. AND MRS. GATES,
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.432
WE'RE SO DEEPLY SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.201
THANK YOU.

27:16.402 --> 27:19.271
WE BROUGHT THE PICTURES
OF GRACEY YOU ASKED FOR.

27:19.338 --> 27:22.341
I HOPE YOU FIND ONES THAT
WILL HELP YOU AT THE TRIAL.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.177
THANK YOU.
Mr. Gates: UH, BEFORE WE GO
THROUGH THEM...

27:25.244 --> 27:28.247
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SEE
WHERE OUR LITTLE GIRL DIED?

27:29.548 --> 27:31.918
OF COURSE, YES.
LIEUTENANT?

27:33.419 --> 27:35.354
RIGHT OVER HERE BY THE CURB.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.526
YOU CAN SEE THE SKID MARKS
FROM THE ACCIDENT OVER THERE.

27:40.592 --> 27:42.361
HER HELMET FLEW OFF,

27:42.428 --> 27:46.733
AND, UH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
GRACEY WAS NEVER
IN ANY PAIN AT ALL.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.936
SHE DIDN'T SUFFER.
THANK YOU.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.772
AND SHE TALKED ABOUT THE TWO
OF YOU AT THE END.

27:52.839 --> 27:55.775
W

27:55.842 --> 27:57.810
SHE SAID THAT SHE WAS
REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

27:57.877 --> 27:59.678
TO GETTING HOME
FOR THE HOLIDAYS

27:59.746 --> 28:03.816
AND THAT SHE HOPED THE ACCIDENT
WOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THAT...

28:03.883 --> 28:07.319
AND THAT SHE, UH --
SHE GUESSED THAT YOU WERE RIGHT,

28:07.386 --> 28:09.722
BECAUSE SHE GOT HURT
RIDING THAT MOTORCYCLE...

28:09.789 --> 28:12.358
AND SHE HOPED THAT
YOU WOULDN'T BE MAD AT HER.

28:14.426 --> 28:17.463
I'M ANGRY, ALRIGHT,
BUT

28:17.529 --> 28:19.465
NOT WITH GRACEY.

28:21.734 --> 28:25.404
I WANT TO MEET THE PERSON
WHO KNOCKED HER DOWN
AND RAN AWAY.

28:25.471 --> 28:27.406
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

28:29.308 --> 28:31.410
PLEASE, L-LET ME
TAKE YOU OVER HERE

28:31.477 --> 28:33.813
TO THE, UH, REST
OF THE CRIME SCENE.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.414
OKAY?
OKAY.

28:35.481 --> 28:38.517
YOU ALRIGHT?
YOU READY?

28:38.584 --> 28:40.086
YEAH, YEAH.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.255
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF?

28:43.322 --> 28:46.392
COULD YOU STEP WITH ME THIS WAY
A LITTLE WAYS?

28:46.458 --> 28:49.896
OUR GUYS IN I.T. WERE ABLE
TO PATCH MRS. MYERS'
CELLPHONE BACK TOGETHER.

28:49.962 --> 28:53.365
SHE GOT A VERY INTERESTING TEXT
FROM HER DAUGHTER
RIGHT BEFORE THE ACCIDENT.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.701
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES,
WHERE ARE MY GLASSES?

28:55.768 --> 28:57.636
I GOT IT.

28:57.703 --> 28:59.171
"MOM, WATCH OUT --

28:59.238 --> 29:01.974
D.U.I. CHECKPOINT
AT BEVERLY AND LA BREA."

29:02.041 --> 29:03.542
OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

29:03.609 --> 29:06.178
THAT'S WHY SHE DROVE WEST,
EVEN THOUGH SHE LIVES EAST --

29:06.245 --> 29:08.680
TO AVOID
THE SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT.
HER DAUGHTER HELPED HER.

29:08.747 --> 29:12.885
AND THEIR DAUGHTER DIED.
AT LEAST WE KNOW SHE WAS DRUNK.

29:12.952 --> 29:15.521
NO, NO. WE ONLY KNOW
THAT HER DAUGHTER SENT A TEXT.

29:15.587 --> 29:18.390
THAT DOESN'T PROVE
SHE WAS IMPAIRED OR
SHE WAS EVEN DRIVING.

29:18.457 --> 29:20.226
W-WAIT A MINUTE.
JUST WAIT A MINUTE.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.461
I WONDER IF MRS. MYERS
RAN A RED LIGHT

29:22.528 --> 29:24.496
SOMEWHERE ON HER WAY BACK
TO THE RESTAURANT.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.966
CITY COUNCIL SUSPENDED
TRAFFIC-LIGHT CAMERAS
MONTHS AGO.

29:27.033 --> 29:30.236
YEAH, IN L.A.,
BUT IN WEST HOLLYWOOD,
THEY STILL HAVE THEM,

29:30.302 --> 29:32.304
WHICH IS THE DIRECTION
MRS. MYERS WAS DRIVING.

29:32.371 --> 29:35.707
AND THEY STILL USE
PHOTO ENFORCEMENT.

29:35.774 --> 29:38.610
MRS. MYERS WAS DRUNK.
SHE JUST SMASHED INTO SOMEONE.

29:38.677 --> 29:40.612
SHE FLED THE SCENE
OF THE ACCIDENT.

29:40.679 --> 29:42.548
IT'D BE WONDERFUL
SHE RUN A RED LIGHT.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.550
SOMETHING YOU'D NEVER KNOW
WITHOUT ASKING.

29:44.616 --> 29:47.686
YEAH, THIS IS
DETECTIVE DAVID GABRIEL,
L.A.P.D., MAJOR CRIMES.

29:47.753 --> 29:51.357
CAN YOU PATCH ME THROUGH
TO THE HEAD OF
YOUR TRAFFIC DIVISION, PLEASE?

29:56.863 --> 29:58.530
WE HAVE HER IN THE CAR 30
SECONDS AFTER THE HIT-AND-RUN.

29:58.597 --> 30:00.566
FANTASTIC.
STILL MANSLAUGHTER.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.469
BETWEEN THE BAR TAB,
THE PHONE TEXT,
THE PRINTS, THE BLOODWORK?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.704
THAT'S ALL GREAT,
BUT WE STILL CANNOT PROVE

30:05.771 --> 30:07.506
SHE WAS LEGALLY
OVER THE LIMIT

30:07.573 --> 30:09.708
WITHOUT A CONCURRENT BLOOD
OR URINE TEST -- PERIOD.

30:09.775 --> 30:12.378
PLUS, SHE'S PROBABLY
HAD COCKTAILS
WITH EVERY JUDGE IN TOWN.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.414
LOOK, WE HAVE HER
FOR THE HIT-AND-RUN.

30:15.481 --> 30:18.684
WE HAVE HER
FOR FILING A FALSE REPORT
OF HER CAR BEING STOLEN.

30:18.750 --> 30:21.587
WE'LL GET HER
OFF THE STREETS.
SHE WILL DO REAL TIME.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.324
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW A POWERFUL PERSON
GO TO JAIL?

30:25.391 --> 30:28.427
SHE'LL GO TO REHAB IN MALIBU.
SHE'LL GO TO COMMUNITY SERVICE.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.997
SHE'LL GO TO THERAPY.
SHE'LL GO ON PROBATION.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.065
AND THEN SHE'S GONNA GO
TO A BAR,

30:33.132 --> 30:35.534
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS
ALL OVER AGAIN.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.770
MANSLAUGHTER IS A SLAM DUNK.
WE RISK IT BY GOING FOR MURDER.

30:38.837 --> 30:42.208
CHIEF, I WAS JUST ON THE STREET
WITH THE VICTIM'S PARENTS,

30:42.274 --> 30:44.410
SHOWING THEM THE BLOODSTAIN
WHERE THEIR DAUGHTER DIED.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.246
IF WE GET IN FRONT OF A JURY --
ANDY, BELIEVE ME --

30:47.313 --> 30:49.248
I'M SURE THE PARENTS
ARE VERY EFFECTIVE,

30:49.315 --> 30:52.651
BUT I ALSO GUARANTEE YOU
THEY WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED
TO TESTIFY.

30:52.718 --> 30:55.687
HE'S RIGHT, LIEUTENANT.
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE USE
OF THE PARENTS,

30:55.754 --> 30:58.224
WE NEED TO DO IT NOW.

31:02.228 --> 31:05.965
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU FOUND
JOSE REYES SO QUICKLY.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.667
DID HE ADMIT ANYTHING?
WHAT IS HE SAYING?

31:08.734 --> 31:09.969
WHAT THEY ALL SAY --

31:10.036 --> 31:12.371
"I'M INNOCENT.
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG GUY."

31:12.438 --> 31:15.541
BUT WE'RE JUST ON THE VERGE
OF PUTTING TOGETHER
ALL THE DETAILS.

31:15.607 --> 31:18.610
NOW, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SEPARATE Y'ALL,
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

31:18.677 --> 31:21.780
SO THAT YOU CAN INDEPENDENTLY
VERIFY EVERYTHING.

31:21.847 --> 31:23.282
SEPARATE?
YES.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.351
KELLY, GO WITH CHIEF JOHNSON,
IF YOU WILL.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.653
MRS. MYERS,
WILL YOU COME WITH ME?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.821
ALRIGHT. GO ON.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.390
THANK YOU.

31:37.229 --> 31:39.231
Provenza:
THIS WAY, KELLY.

31:39.298 --> 31:41.467
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
UH, SHARING SPACE.

31:41.533 --> 31:44.103
IT'S A LITTLE CROWDED UP HERE.
HERE WE GO.

31:46.472 --> 31:48.740
AH, THIS IS
MR. AND MRS. GATES.

31:48.807 --> 31:50.676
THEY'RE
THE VICTIM'S PARENTS.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.247
WE ASKED THEM TO SORT THROUGH
SOME PHOTOS OF THEIR DAUGHTER.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.317
I-IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
FOR THE JURY TO --
TO HAVE A HUMAN FACE

31:58.384 --> 32:02.221
TO GO ALONG WITH THE STORY
THAT WE TELL THEM AT TRIAL.

32:02.288 --> 32:05.357
OH, I-I'M SORRY, MR. AND
MRS. GATES, THIS IS KELLY.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.195
KELLY IS A POTENTIAL WITNESS
IN YOUR DAUGHTER'S CASE.
OH.

32:09.261 --> 32:12.999
WHAT A -- WHAT A GREAT PHOTO.

32:13.065 --> 32:15.601
IS THIS, UH,
HIGH

32:15.667 --> 32:17.736
WELL, NOW,
THAT'S ONE WITH THE CAP ON,

32:17.803 --> 32:19.938
BUT I LIKE THE ONE
WITHOUT BETTER.

32:20.006 --> 32:21.974
IT'S
WHERE IS IT?

32:22.041 --> 32:24.010
Mr. Gates:
I THINK I SAW IT.

32:24.076 --> 32:26.612
OH, YEAH.

32:26.678 --> 32:27.646
HERE.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.020
SHE DID HER HAIR UP
FOR IT.

32:36.855 --> 32:40.659
WELL, KELLY, WHY DON'T YOU,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT HERE?

32:40.726 --> 32:44.763
AND IF YOU FOLKS WILL EXCUSE ME,
I'M GONNA STEP OUT FOR A BIT.

32:44.830 --> 32:48.834
IF YOU WOULD JUST -- JUST KEEP
SORTING THROUGH THE PHOTOS.

32:48.900 --> 32:52.738
YEAH, WE WILL.
WE WILL.

32:55.941 --> 33:00.479
WE ASKED THE VICTIMS' FAMILIES
TO PICK OUT A PHOTO OR TWO,

33:00.546 --> 33:04.283
AND THEY ALWAYS BRING IN
EVERY PICTURE THEY HAVE.

33:04.350 --> 33:07.019
AT LEAST WE'RE PUTTING THEM
TO GOOD USE.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.155
CALL ME WHEN KELLY'S HAD ENOUGH,
WOULD YOU?

33:09.221 --> 33:10.722
YES, MA'AM.

33:19.031 --> 33:22.000
CANDY BAR?
NO, THANK YOU.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.504
YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST QUIT
DRINKING, I PRACTICALLY
LIVED ON THESE THINGS.

33:25.571 --> 33:28.340
YOUR BODY GETS USED TO THE SUGAR
FROM THE BOOZE.

33:28.407 --> 33:29.375
OH.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.443
WHEN DID YOU
QUIT DRINKING?

33:31.510 --> 33:34.380
I'VE BEEN IN A.A.
FOR 15 YEARS NOW.

33:34.446 --> 33:37.015
GOT DOWN TO A CHOICE BETWEEN
THE BADGE AND THE BOTTLE.

33:37.083 --> 33:41.320
THE BADGE DIDN'T
MAKE ME FEEL LIKE CRAP
IN THE MORNING.

33:41.387 --> 33:44.590
WELL, GOOD FOR YOU
AND YOUR HIGHER POWER.

33:44.656 --> 33:47.793
IF YOUR BODY
CAN'T TOLERATE ALCOHOL,
YOU SHOULD GIVE IT UP.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.795
GLAD YOU FIGURED IT OUT.

33:52.098 --> 33:54.333
I DIDN'T FIGURE
ANYTHING OUT.

33:54.400 --> 33:58.036
I JUST QUIT DRINKING.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.239
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE,
MA'AM.

34:08.180 --> 34:10.549
IS IT KELLY?
YEAH, KELLY.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.689
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
UM, 17.

34:17.756 --> 34:23.162
OH. THAT'S --
THAT'S ALMOST
OUR DAUGHTER'S AGE.

34:23.229 --> 34:25.664
WELL...

34:25.731 --> 34:28.200
THERE'S SOME SHOTS OF HER,
IF YOU WANT TO --

34:28.267 --> 34:29.701
THAT'S, UH...

34:29.768 --> 34:31.203
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.604
W

34:32.671 --> 34:34.606
UH, WE WENT DOWN
TO CORPUS CHRISTI.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.042
OH, THAT'S RIGHT. YEAH.
SHE WAS 4 THEN.

34:37.109 --> 34:40.746
SHE REALLY LIKED THE BEACH
AND STUFF, 'CAUSE WE DIDN'T GO
VERY OFTEN,

34:40.812 --> 34:43.549
BUT THAT TRIP, SHE...

34:43.615 --> 34:46.017
THAT'S THE TRIP SHE...

35:09.275 --> 35:11.042
KELLY, THIS IS, UH,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.513
HE'S GOING TO HELP US
LOOK AT THOSE PICTURES
I TOLD YOU ABOUT.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.715
WHY DON'T YOU
HAVE A SEAT?

35:19.918 --> 35:22.888
WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE,
UH, PHOTOS FROM THE ACCIDENT?

35:36.402 --> 35:38.604
OH, MY GOD.
SORRY TO PUT YOU THROUGH THIS

35:38.670 --> 35:42.708
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT HAPPENED TO GRACEY.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.611
ANYTHING THAT YOU NEED ME TO,
I CAN EXPLAIN.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.813
BUT, YOU SEE,
THE VICTIM'S HELMET CAME OFF

35:47.879 --> 35:52.418
WHEN YOUR MOM RAN INTO HER.
WHEN MY MOM RAN INTO HER?

35:52.484 --> 35:55.020
IS THAT WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

35:55.086 --> 35:56.555
THIS...

35:56.622 --> 35:58.757
IS YOUR MOM
RUNNING A RED LIGHT.

35:59.891 --> 36:01.627
YOU NOTICE THE TIME CODE?

36:01.693 --> 36:04.496
THAT WAS LESS THAN 30 SECONDS
AFTER THE HIT-AND-RUN

36:04.563 --> 36:07.065
AND EIGHT BLOCKS
FROM WHERE GRACEY LOST HER --

36:07.132 --> 36:09.368
MY MOM SAID HER CAR
WAS STOLEN.

36:09.435 --> 36:13.839
SHE LIED TO YOU, KELLY,
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
DRUNKS DO.

36:13.905 --> 36:16.242
YOU KNEW SHE WAS DRUNK,
DIDN'T YOU?

36:18.577 --> 36:20.512
THIS IS YOUR MOM'S
CELLPHONE.

36:20.579 --> 36:24.115
AND THIS IS A TEXT
THAT YOU SENT TO YOUR MOM

36:24.182 --> 36:26.318
A FEW MINUTES
BEFORE THE HIT-AND-RUN.

36:26.385 --> 36:30.556
AND THIS IS THE ROUTE
THAT YOUR MOM TOOK HOME

36:30.622 --> 36:34.125
AFTER YOU WARNED HER
ABOUT THE SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.395
SHE DROVE WEST
EVEN THOUGH YOU LIVE EAST,

36:36.462 --> 36:38.397
AND THIS IS WHERE
THE ACCIDENT HAPPENED.

36:40.466 --> 36:43.702
NOW, LOOK, KELLY,
IT'S ONLY NATURAL TO WANT
TO PROTECT YOUR MOTHER.

36:43.769 --> 36:46.638
I WASN'T TRYING TO PROTECT
MY MOTHER.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.640
I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT MY DAD.

36:48.707 --> 36:51.243
HE SAID IF SHE GOT
ONE MORE D.U.I.,

36:51.310 --> 36:54.746
THEN IT WOULD
REALLY HURT HIS CAREER.
BUT HE IS NEVER HOME.

36:54.813 --> 36:58.183
HE'S ALWAYS WORKING.
AND I'M THE ONE
WHO HAS TO WATCH HER.

36:58.250 --> 37:01.287
ONE TIME,
I-I FOUND HER IN THE GARAGE

37:01.353 --> 37:03.121
JUST PASSED OUT
IN HER OWN VOMIT.

37:03.188 --> 37:06.925
YOUR MOM'S LUCKY.
SHE COULD HAVE DIED
IN THE ACCIDENT, TOO.

37:06.992 --> 37:10.396
MAYBE NEXT TIME, SHE WILL...
UNLESS YOU HELP US.

37:10.462 --> 37:12.931
I CAN'T HELP YOU.
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

37:12.998 --> 37:16.902
BY TELLING US HOW MUCH SHE DRANK
ON THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT.

37:16.968 --> 37:19.137
WE CAN STOP HER
FROM EVER DOING THIS AGAIN.

37:19.204 --> 37:22.408
I PROMISE YOU, KELLY,
WE CAN HELP SAVE
YOUR MOM'S LIFE,

37:22.474 --> 37:25.311
BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP
TO DO IT.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.555
UM...

37:40.426 --> 37:43.094
MOM HAD, UH...

37:43.161 --> 37:46.698
THREE GLASSES
OF VODKA AT HOME,

37:46.765 --> 37:49.401
LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES
BEFORE WE GO, UM...

37:49.468 --> 37:52.371
ANYWHERE, ACTUALLY.

37:53.839 --> 37:56.708
UM, AND, UH,
THEN AT THE RESTAURANT,

37:56.775 --> 37:58.777
SHE HAD A LOT TO DRINK
THERE, TOO.

37:58.844 --> 38:02.280
UM, SHE WASN'T SLURRING
OR ANYTHING,

38:02.348 --> 38:04.383
LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES,

38:04.450 --> 38:07.419
BUT SHE WAS REALLY BOMBED.

38:07.486 --> 38:09.921
OH, MY GOD.

38:09.988 --> 38:12.524
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.793
IT'S MY FAULT
THIS POOR GIRL GOT KILLED.

38:14.860 --> 38:15.961
IT'S MY FAULT.

38:16.027 --> 38:18.330
NO, NO, KELLY,
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT,

38:18.397 --> 38:20.366
BUT I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU FEEL
THAT WAY.

38:20.432 --> 38:22.801
I'M -- I'M MARRIED
TO A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC,

38:22.868 --> 38:26.738
AND HE'D BE THE FIRST TO SAY
THAT ADDICTS ARE GREAT

38:26.805 --> 38:30.308
AT MAKING THE REST OF US
FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR THEIR MISTAKES.

38:30.376 --> 38:31.943
YOUR HUSBAND WAS --

38:32.010 --> 38:34.846
AN ALCOHOLIC, YES.

38:34.913 --> 38:38.850
AND NOW HE IS
THE MOST THOROUGHLY DECENT

38:38.917 --> 38:41.620
AND WONDERFUL MAN
I'VE EVER KNOWN.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.755
BUT HE TELLS ME ALL THE TIME

38:43.822 --> 38:46.625
THAT HE'S JUST ONE DRINK AWAY
FROM LOSING IT ALL,

38:46.692 --> 38:50.862
AND HE NEEDS HELP
STAYING SOBER.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.131
MOM'S TOO PROUD
TO ASK FOR HELP.

38:53.198 --> 38:56.201
I PROMISE YOU --
I'M GONNA GET YOUR MOM
TO STOP DRINKING

38:56.267 --> 38:58.437
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

39:04.410 --> 39:09.748
Kelly: MOM HAD, UH...
THREE GLASSES OF VODKA AT HOME,

39:09.815 --> 39:11.950
LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES
BEFORE WE GO, UM...

39:12.017 --> 39:14.953
ANYWHERE, ACTUALLY.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.723
UM, AND, UH,
THEN AT THE RESTAURANT,

39:17.789 --> 39:20.792
SHE HAD A LOT
TO DRINK THERE, TOO.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.594
A LOT TO DRINK.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.096
UM, SHE WASN'T SLURRING
OR ANYTHING,

39:25.163 --> 39:29.200
LIKE SHE USUALLY DOES,
BUT SHE WAS REALLY BOMBED.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.236
OH, MY GOD.

39:31.302 --> 39:34.272
IT'S MY FAULT
THIS POOR GIRL GOT KILLED.
IT'S MY FAULT.

39:34.339 --> 39:35.507
NO --

39:36.575 --> 39:37.943
JAY, I WANT A LAWYER.

39:38.009 --> 39:39.545
THEN YOU'D BETTER
CALL ONE.

39:39.611 --> 39:42.047
CHIEF POPE, CHIEF JOHNSON,

39:42.113 --> 39:45.050
I APPRECIATE HOW DIFFICULT THIS
INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN FOR YOU.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.686
I'M NOT GONNA FORCE OUR DAUGHTER
TO TAKE THE STAND

39:47.753 --> 39:49.955
AND WATCH THIS HORROR SHOW
YOU'VE CREATED

39:50.021 --> 39:52.491
PLAY OUT ON THE 6:00 NEWS.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.960
MM, SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

39:55.026 --> 39:57.195
YOUR CAREER.
YOU DON'T CARE
WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

39:57.262 --> 40:01.467
YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THAT GIRL
YOU RAN OVER AND LEFT TO DIE
IN THE STREET.

40:01.533 --> 40:04.369
JAY. JAY! JAY...

40:04.436 --> 40:08.574
YOU GET ME AN ATTORNEY,
OR I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'LL GET MY OWN,

40:08.640 --> 40:10.842
AND I WILL SUE YOU.

40:10.909 --> 40:14.079
I HAVE GIVEN MY WHOLE LIFE
FOR THIS MARRIAGE.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.748
I WILL NOT LET YOU
SCREW ME ON THIS.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.050
OH, YOU THINK
I'M BLUFFING?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:19.117 --> 40:21.920
I'M GOING TO RESIGN
AND THEN GET
OUR DAUGHTER HOME.

40:21.987 --> 40:26.525
OH, MY GOD.
THAT POOR GIRL.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.393
GOD, GAIL! GOD!

40:28.460 --> 40:29.728
JAY. JAY!

40:29.795 --> 40:31.162
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME
LIKE THIS.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.500
MRS. MYERS, PLEASE.
HE'S COMING BACK. JAY. JAY!

40:34.566 --> 40:39.204
I AM NOT AN ALCOHOLIC.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.372
OKAY.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.475
BUT YOU ARE DEFINITELY
A MURDERER.

40:43.542 --> 40:47.813
GAIL MYERS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT.
NO, NO. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.749
IF YOU GIVE THAT UP...
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYBODY.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.751
...ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN...
I'LL GET TREATMENT.

40:52.818 --> 40:55.186
I'LL GO TO REHAB.
...IN A COURT OF LAW --

40:55.253 --> 40:57.188
I'LL STOP!
LOOK, OKAY, OKAY!

40:57.255 --> 40:59.491
LOOK! HOLD ON!

40:59.558 --> 41:02.127
I-I-IF THIS -- IF THIS IS
HOW IT HAS TO BE...

41:04.229 --> 41:06.898
...I...

41:06.965 --> 41:09.801
I WILL GET HELP...

41:09.868 --> 41:13.204
...IF YOU THINK
THAT I SHOULD.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.774
I WILL GET HELP.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.976
AND WHO WILL HELP
GRACEY ANN GATES?

41:21.179 --> 41:22.180
LIEUTENANT.

41:23.649 --> 41:25.617
Provenza:
DON'T YOU WORRY, MRS. MYERS.

41:25.684 --> 41:27.819
WE'RE GOING TO GET YOU
SOME HELP.

41:37.863 --> 41:41.432
JAY MAY BE STEPPING DOWN,
BUT...LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES.

41:41.499 --> 41:43.602
ARRESTING
A POLICE COMMISSIONER'S WIFE

41:43.669 --> 41:46.237
IS NOT GONNA MAKE US HEROES
AROUND HERE.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.473
HOW MUCH WORSE
CAN IT GET?

41:48.540 --> 41:52.110
I MEAN, REALLY.

41:52.177 --> 41:54.112
I GUESS WE'LL SEE.
