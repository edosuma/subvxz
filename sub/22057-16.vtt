00:01.669 --> 00:04.638
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...
Can I give you a lift?

00:04.672 --> 00:06.774
Who are you
Jessie,

00:06.807 --> 00:08.609
you're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.344
Undercover?

00:10.378 --> 00:13.347
I need to keep a close eye
on a local Yakuza boss.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.349
Guy by the name
of Hideki Tashiro.

00:15.383 --> 00:19.120
If I do this thing,
am I gonna end up dead?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.589
I'll protect you.
You have my word.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.257
All right, Noshimuri.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.059
You got yourself a C.I.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.429
My father was
a very cautious man.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.664
That's why he had
large sums of money

00:30.698 --> 00:32.300
buried all over the island.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.302
A large portion
of that money

00:34.335 --> 00:36.237
once belonged to you.

00:36.270 --> 00:39.073
And I know where that's buried.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.442
Michelle, we're done here.
No, no, wait, wait.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.378
I know something about you,
Adam Noshimuri.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.815
Something that could change
your life forever.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.320
*

01:31.725 --> 01:35.095
(Hawaii Five-O
theme song plays)

02:02.790 --> 02:05.293
*

02:11.665 --> 02:14.268
WOMAN: I know this
can seem overwhelming,

02:14.302 --> 02:16.870
but please don't feel like
you're being auditioned here.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.739
As head of admissions,
it's my job

02:18.772 --> 02:20.808
to uphold the exacting standards

02:20.841 --> 02:23.211
we've established here
at Lawrence Academy

02:23.244 --> 02:25.346
and to maintain a student body

02:25.379 --> 02:27.448
that reflects
our diverse community.

02:27.481 --> 02:30.618
But listen, this process
is just as much about

02:30.651 --> 02:33.754
you deciding if we're the
right fit for your son, Noah.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.589
Well, we love this school.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.790
Isn't that right, Paul?

02:36.824 --> 02:38.359
Yeah, we certainly do.
We love it.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.261
Ms. Meech, we just
want to give Noah

02:40.294 --> 02:42.263
the best possible
start to life, and...

02:42.296 --> 02:43.797
you know, everybody
that we talk to

02:43.831 --> 02:45.599
says that this is the place.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.867
They do.
Yeah.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.669
Why don't you tell me
a little bit about Noah.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.804
He's the single greatest thing
that's ever happened to us.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.407
He is, um, so loving

02:53.441 --> 02:56.244
and-and kind and compassionate.
And, Ms. Meech, this...

02:56.277 --> 02:58.546
this kid is absolutely
killing it at preschool.

02:58.579 --> 02:59.680
Like, the teachers just

02:59.713 --> 03:02.583
won't stop raving about him.
TANI: That's true.

03:02.616 --> 03:03.851
He recently informed us
that, uh,

03:03.884 --> 03:06.420
he wanted to be a doctor
when he grows up, so...

03:06.454 --> 03:07.588
JUNIOR:
Or a ballplayer
'cause, you know,

03:07.621 --> 03:08.856
he's super athletic.
He is athletic.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.459
He's athletic.
He's smart. He's artistic.

03:11.492 --> 03:14.895
He could be an architect
or something like that.

03:14.928 --> 03:16.897
Wow. Well, he sounds wonderful.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.966
I can't wait to meet him.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.968
Well, speaking of meeting, um...

03:21.001 --> 03:23.804
Ms. Meech, I'm sorry,
but we were under the impression

03:23.837 --> 03:25.439
that Headmaster Waller would be

03:25.473 --> 03:26.774
part of this
interview as well.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.577
I'm so sorry. I guess
you haven't heard.

03:29.610 --> 03:33.481
Headmaster Waller went
missing three days ago.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.715
Vanished.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.250
No one knows where he went.

03:36.284 --> 03:39.987
Oh, my gosh,
that's... terrible.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.322
It's a missing persons case.

03:41.355 --> 03:42.623
Why do you need us
to go undercover?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.292
DANNY:
Because HPD already

03:44.325 --> 03:45.959
questioned everybody
at that place,

03:45.993 --> 03:47.695
okay, and nobody said anything.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.997
The point is this. They...
these people, they don't talk

03:50.030 --> 03:52.700
to anybody unless you're part
of their little stupid clique.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.335
They gossip. They talk
behind each other's backs.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.669
You understand?
STEVE: Here's the thing.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.870
We're going to insert you two.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.138
You're gonna pose
as prospective parents.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.908
You're gonna go to a couple of
events, see what you can learn.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.743
See, all due respect, Commander,
I'm just worried

04:02.776 --> 04:05.346
that no one's gonna believe
that we're someone's parents.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.280
Maybe they'll believe it
for you, but I'm

04:06.314 --> 04:07.515
far too young
to be anyone's mother.

04:07.548 --> 04:10.351
Ah...
STEVE: Hey, is it just me,
or are you picking up

04:10.384 --> 04:12.553
on the chemistry going on?
I mean, it's like
they're married.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.021
TANI: Okay.
STEVE: It's crazy.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.889
When Headmaster Waller
didn't make it home,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.991
his wife called the police.

04:18.025 --> 04:19.860
They came and searched
the school,

04:19.893 --> 04:21.862
conducted interviews
with our entire staff.

04:21.895 --> 04:25.766
Of course, as an
ambassador of this school,

04:25.799 --> 04:28.702
I can assure you that no one
in our community

04:28.736 --> 04:31.572
could've had anything to do
with his disappearance.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.974
Someone's gotta have a theory
as to what happened to him.

04:34.007 --> 04:37.511
If I'm being candid, um,
Headmaster Waller has

04:37.545 --> 04:40.714
a strong personality,
and, uh, that personality

04:40.748 --> 04:42.750
did sometimes
rub people the wrong way.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.919
But listen, I don't want
to make this sad situation

04:45.953 --> 04:49.523
the focus of our meeting,
so let's get back to Noah.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.459
You must have pictures.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.395
Of Noah?

04:55.963 --> 04:57.064
Do we ever.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.671
* Yeah, she's the boss
and I'm an old... *

05:03.704 --> 05:05.439
Come on. Closer.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.541
Come on. You're in love.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.377
No, we're not.
We're married.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.612
* But when she looks
behind these eyes, girl *

05:11.645 --> 05:13.814
* I can see the psyche...

05:13.847 --> 05:14.982
And voila.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.685
One beautiful nuclear family.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.888
MEECH:
Wow. What a lovely family.

05:20.921 --> 05:24.091
Noah looks like
such a happy young boy.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.059
Oh, yeah.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.128
I can see him fitting in
quite well here.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.097
Well, we love the way
that sounds.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.533
Is there anything that we can do
to increase our chances?

05:32.566 --> 05:35.102
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.203
What
TANI: $600.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.472
$600?
And-and that's just
for the fund-raiser.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.708
There's also
a charity event today

05:40.741 --> 05:42.810
to raise money
for the school.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.012
And rumor has it, if you don't
bid on something pricey,

05:45.045 --> 05:47.715
your kid's not getting in.
GROVER:
Tell you what.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.117
If you ever in the future are
planning to have any children,

05:50.150 --> 05:51.852
you better start saving
your money right now,

05:51.885 --> 05:53.454
because it never ends.

05:53.487 --> 05:55.623
Renee and I just went
to visit Samantha at college.

05:55.656 --> 05:57.858
She's already blown through
her monthly allowance.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.660
Yeah, well, good beer
ain't cheap.

05:59.693 --> 06:00.861
Wait, what?
Huh?

06:00.894 --> 06:02.696
What

06:02.730 --> 06:05.466
Because I meant books
and school supplies.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.000
She meant books.
I did.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.602
Mm-hmm.

06:08.636 --> 06:10.103
Well, anyway,

06:10.137 --> 06:12.072
I realize I'm a little
late to the party,

06:12.105 --> 06:15.409
but how do we know that this
disappearance of our vic

06:15.443 --> 06:17.445
has any connection to
him being a headmaster?

06:17.478 --> 06:18.879
Couldn't he have
been carjacked?

06:18.912 --> 06:21.014
Hell, the guy could've been
murdered at random

06:21.048 --> 06:22.650
or for any number of reasons

06:22.683 --> 06:24.184
that have nothing
to do with that school.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.686
You're absolutely right, okay?

06:25.719 --> 06:27.588
Except when you take
into consideration the fact

06:27.621 --> 06:30.023
that his briefcase,
his laptop and his cell phone

06:30.057 --> 06:31.058
were all still in his office.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.661
TANI:
That in itself is weird,
but then consider

06:33.694 --> 06:36.029
that two days later the janitor
of the school

06:36.063 --> 06:37.898
finds a nine-millimeter
shell casing

06:37.931 --> 06:39.500
in a vacuum cleaner bag.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.569
All right, well, fair enough.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.170
So you're thinking
that the murder took place

06:43.203 --> 06:45.172
somewhere on school property?
STEVE: Correct.

06:45.205 --> 06:46.674
We're thinking
the killer got the body

06:46.707 --> 06:48.476
out of there in the trunk
of Waller's car,

06:48.509 --> 06:51.178
while forgetting the
personal effects in his office.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.146
CSU searched the school.
They didn't turn up anything.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.915
And right now they're
looking into his computer

06:54.948 --> 06:58.151
to see if they can recover
anything that's relevant.

06:58.185 --> 06:59.920
There's also an APB out
on his Audi.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.989
Meanwhile, I pulled
his financials.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.526
There's no big withdrawals that
would suggest that he ran off.

07:05.559 --> 07:08.061
But I'm still not hearing a why.
'Cause we don't have
a motive yet, all right?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.897
But that school
is our primary crime scene.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.898
Yeah. I mean, he was
a polarizing figure.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.501
Right, people either loved him
or hated him.

07:13.534 --> 07:15.636
Well, it looks like there
were a lot of people

07:15.669 --> 07:17.471
who were firmly
in the "hate" camp.

07:17.505 --> 07:19.640
I just got off the phone
with the board of trustees,

07:19.673 --> 07:21.108
and over the past five years,

07:21.141 --> 07:23.811
they've received over a hundred
complaints about Waller.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.912
They're sending over
the letters

07:24.945 --> 07:25.879
and e-mails as we speak.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.548
We'll start going
through them A.S.A.P.

07:27.581 --> 07:28.916
STEVE: No, no, no.
Hold that thought.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
I got a better idea--
I'll ask Duke if he can

07:30.984 --> 07:31.885
commit some HPD
resources to that.

07:31.919 --> 07:34.087
'Cause I need you two
at that fund-raiser.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.923
That's where we need to be
if we're gonna narrow down

07:35.956 --> 07:38.225
that suspect pool
and gather more intel.

07:38.258 --> 07:40.227
GROVER: All right, I'll call
the governor, requisition

07:40.260 --> 07:41.629
some funds for this auction.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.763
TANI:
Oh, would you
also ask

07:42.796 --> 07:44.965
if they would spring for a new
cocktail dress for me?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.233
Because I have nothing
in my closet

07:46.266 --> 07:47.668
that would suggest "soccer mom."

07:47.701 --> 07:48.969
Hell no.

07:51.004 --> 07:54.675
We'll try not to bid on
anything expensive, sir.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.677
No, no, you can bid.
Go ahead and bid.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.679
Just don't, uh... don't win.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.849
DANNY:
Vito.

08:01.882 --> 08:04.117
Vito, Vito,
Vito, please.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.586
This is not right.

08:05.619 --> 08:06.854
These numbers
cannot be right.

08:06.887 --> 08:08.522
This is a... we're
trying to make

08:08.556 --> 08:10.290
a small Italian restaurant,
not-not the Taj Mahal.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.725
Hey, you swipe
to the left

08:11.759 --> 08:13.561
if you like the broad?
Look at that one.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.528
I-I don't know.

08:14.562 --> 08:15.763
I'm the wrong person to ask.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.930
Please put the phone away.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.131
Can we focus?
Can we focus?

08:18.165 --> 08:20.000
These contractor
bids are-are nuts.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.669
I... it's just...
it's not even close

08:21.702 --> 08:22.936
to within our budget.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.238
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.174
You know, people come in here,

08:27.207 --> 08:29.109
they see this space,
they think

08:29.142 --> 08:31.111
it's gonna take ages
to build.

08:31.144 --> 08:35.315
Me, I can make this place into
a restaurant three, four weeks.

08:35.348 --> 08:38.185
The problem you have
is all the paperwork, you know?

08:38.218 --> 08:40.621
You got your zoning,
you got your work permits,

08:40.654 --> 08:43.023
you got... you got
your liquor license, you know?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.758
But as long as
that's all lined up,

08:44.792 --> 08:45.993
you're good to go.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.728
Okay, the liquor license,
we should be good.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.763
Steve put the thing
in like a month ago,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.665
so that's... that
shouldn't be a problem.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.100
A month ago?
Yeah, a month ago.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.168
I hate to tell you,
but it's gonna take a year

08:55.202 --> 08:56.269
for that license
to get approved.

08:56.303 --> 09:00.207
I mean, why is that not
the first thing that you did?

09:00.240 --> 09:02.042
You mean, like, 12 months?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.276
Yeah, yeah, like a year.

09:03.310 --> 09:04.945
You know?

09:04.978 --> 09:08.115
But let me see what I can do
to, um, expedite the process.

09:08.148 --> 09:09.650
Come here, come here.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.651
Everything's gonna be okay.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.820
Uncle Vito's here.
All right

09:12.853 --> 09:13.954
Huh?

09:15.055 --> 09:17.290
I don't want you
to touch my hair.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.927
I don't touch your hair.
I'm your uncle.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.029
I love you. Used to sit on
my lap when you were a kid.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.964
Get out of here.
You pissed me off.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.099
*

09:34.107 --> 09:36.309
Adam Noshimuri.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.978
Time we had a talk.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.747
Who are you?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.749
What am I doing here?

09:41.782 --> 09:44.184
Who I am is not important.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.820
What you're doing
in Hawaii,

09:46.854 --> 09:49.790
what you've been up to
ever since you got back--

09:49.823 --> 09:51.291
that's the important thing.

09:55.128 --> 09:57.030
You're here for the money.

09:57.064 --> 10:00.000
I'm sorry. What money?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.870
$20 million that used to
belong to your father.

10:02.903 --> 10:05.773
It was taken from your family

10:05.806 --> 10:07.875
and ended up in the hands
of Michelle Shioma.

10:07.908 --> 10:11.378
I don't know where you're
getting your information from,

10:11.411 --> 10:14.181
but that's simply not true.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.884
Last time I spoke
to Michelle,

10:16.917 --> 10:19.019
before she died,

10:19.052 --> 10:22.255
she told me
about your visit with her.

10:22.289 --> 10:25.092
She said that you discussed
that money

10:25.125 --> 10:27.961
and that she told you
where it's buried.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.197
I don't suppose
it matters to you

10:30.230 --> 10:31.765
that Michelle was lying.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.670
It's just her word against mine.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.405
But I'm telling the truth here.

10:38.438 --> 10:43.744
Hopefully we can avoid
any more unpleasantness

10:43.777 --> 10:45.946
and you'll just tell me

10:45.979 --> 10:49.783
where I can find this money.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.154
Once I have it, we can...

10:54.187 --> 10:56.990
review your current
accommodations.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.926
I don't know where the money is.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.928
That's a shame.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.732
But I thought you might
say that.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.067
Which is why I brought
someone along...

11:08.435 --> 11:10.303
...to jog your memory.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.174
Jessie...

11:14.207 --> 11:17.177
this is Adam Noshimuri.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.380
He's going to tell you
where the money is.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.394
I'll leave you to it.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.344
You're doing great, by the way.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.213
Very convincing.

11:56.083 --> 11:58.786
For God's sake, Adam, just
tell him where the money is.

11:59.853 --> 12:00.620
I can't do that.

12:00.653 --> 12:02.255
You gotta give
Hideki something.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.324
Otherwise, he's gonna make
me beat you to death,

12:04.357 --> 12:05.926
and neither of us want that.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.460
I can't tell him
where the cash is,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.296
because I don't know.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.365
Michelle said
what she said to screw me.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.501
It was her way of getting even.

12:14.534 --> 12:17.037
Then we have a big problem.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.442
Well?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.078
Did he talk,
or did he die?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.267
You have something
you want to tell me?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.440
I'll take you to the money.

13:01.148 --> 13:03.516
As a wise man once said,

13:03.550 --> 13:07.254
I love it when a good plan
comes together.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.521
Who said that?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.523
Hannibal Smith
from The A-Team.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.325
Greatest TV show
of all time.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.296
What we got here
is more like the B or C team.

13:16.329 --> 13:19.132
But it's the best I could
scrape up for what you were

13:19.166 --> 13:20.067
willing to spend.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.568
Well, I'm impressed
that you actually

13:21.601 --> 13:23.603
got an electrician
for 20 bucks an hour.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.974
He's not technically
an electrician.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.075
What's that?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.242
What did you say?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.377
You know what?
I don't want to know.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.445
Forget that.
Look, big guy.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.381
I need you to do me
a solid here.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.448
Uh, stick around, supervise.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.885
I just remembered
I got somewhere I need to be.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.253
Oh, no, no. Sorry.

13:40.287 --> 13:42.856
I gotta bounce
after this boba's done.

13:42.890 --> 13:45.058
Got my own business to run.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.927
What are you talking about?
Come on.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.329
I need you to keep
an eagle eye on this crew here.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.564
I'm gonna be gone an hour--
two, tops

13:51.598 --> 13:54.067
You do me this favor,
I'm gonna slap you up

13:54.101 --> 13:56.970
a meal for two
as soon as this place opens.

13:57.004 --> 13:58.438
Lucky for you,
you're negotiating

13:58.471 --> 14:00.073
in my preferred
currency.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.510
You got two hours, OG.
Two hours.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.046
Two!

14:06.079 --> 14:07.915
How far?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.483
It's gonna take a while.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.319
You have until 4:00.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.187
If I don't have
the money by then...

14:14.221 --> 14:16.323
Well, I don't have
to tell you how things end.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.324
You drive.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.625
You're up front.

14:28.435 --> 14:29.937
You feel that?

14:29.970 --> 14:32.339
You make any move
I don't like,

14:32.372 --> 14:34.942
try anything stupid,

14:34.975 --> 14:37.110
I'll be painting
that windshield red.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.213
Let's go.

14:47.487 --> 14:51.091
For those of you
who don't know me...

14:51.124 --> 14:52.225
why not?

14:52.259 --> 14:53.460
You're in my garden.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.497
No, anyway...
I'm Natalie Barton,

14:57.530 --> 15:00.133
head of the
Lawrence Academy PTA,

15:00.167 --> 15:02.135
and we're here today
to raise money

15:02.169 --> 15:04.304
to equip our fabulous new gym

15:04.337 --> 15:06.206
that will be opening
in the spring.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.375
Of course, I'm obligated
to call it fabulous, seeing as

15:08.408 --> 15:09.709
my contractor
husband, Jared,

15:09.742 --> 15:12.079
has been overseeing
its construction.

15:12.112 --> 15:15.048
I prefer "builder."

15:15.082 --> 15:16.483
Whatever, hon.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.385
Now, if I could just get him

15:18.418 --> 15:20.520
to fix that toilet
that's been running.

15:23.390 --> 15:25.292
Now, I would be remiss
if I didn't mention

15:25.325 --> 15:26.626
how very sad we all are

15:26.659 --> 15:29.196
that Headmaster Waller
isn't here with us today.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.498
The gym was very much
his vision.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.566
But I know that he
would want today

15:33.600 --> 15:36.003
to go ahead as planned.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.238
So let's join his family
in praying for his safe return.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.672
We hope to have him back soon.

15:44.044 --> 15:46.346
This new gymnasium is a sign
of what we can achieve

15:46.379 --> 15:49.682
if we work together,
opening our minds,

15:49.716 --> 15:52.285
our hearts
and our checkbooks.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.686
Now, let's go spend some money.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.097
I have to say,
this whole situation

16:04.131 --> 16:05.432
with Headmaster Waller
is a little unnerving.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.534
At the risk
of sounding heartless,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.269
we're about to commit
to sending our son here,

16:09.302 --> 16:11.304
and we don't even know who's
gonna be running the school.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.773
Yeah. Uh, do you guys have
any idea why he went AWOL?

16:13.806 --> 16:15.042
WOMAN:
Yeah, I heard he

16:15.075 --> 16:16.443
was dipping
into the gymnasium fund.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.378
It would explain why
they're back to fund-raising.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.580
Yeah, and Sheila
from the yearbook committee

16:20.613 --> 16:22.015
told me Waller was

16:22.049 --> 16:23.316
having an affair with someone

16:23.350 --> 16:24.517
on the Spring Gala
committee.

16:24.551 --> 16:25.718
And what about

16:25.752 --> 16:28.188
the Finkelman kid who was
expelled from school last year?

16:28.221 --> 16:30.057
I heard the family
was gonna sue.

16:31.358 --> 16:33.260
Hey, how's it going, everyone?
Hi. How are you?

16:33.293 --> 16:34.361
Hey. Good to see
you guys.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.563
We just wanted to know,
do you guys know anything

16:36.596 --> 16:39.066
about what happened to,
uh, Headmaster Waller?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.534
Hey, you guys heard anything
about Headmaster Waller?

16:41.568 --> 16:42.769
Hi. Hello.
Hey. Hi.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.604
Nice to see you.
Hi.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.074
All right, and then there's
the Davis family.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.509
Apparently, Waller kicked their
son off the basketball team

16:49.542 --> 16:51.744
after he failed
the Algebra I midterm.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.280
GROVER:
This is all good stuff.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.747
Good job, kiddo.
Gonna start running

16:54.781 --> 16:56.749
some of these leads,
see if anything pans out.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.485
Listen, in the meantime,
you guys better get back

16:58.518 --> 17:00.187
in that party,
keep digging for info, please.

17:00.220 --> 17:01.388
Okay, I-I gotta go rescue Junior

17:01.421 --> 17:04.124
before he snaps
and chokes out Tad.

17:04.157 --> 17:05.492
Okay. Who's... who's Tad?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.327
Uh, Tad Beckerman, optometrist.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.062
Major player on the PTA.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.463
He also has awful halitosis

17:10.497 --> 17:12.365
and no respect
for personal space.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.366
Buh-bye.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.434
Good-bye.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.835
How'd it go this
morning with Vito?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.371
It was good. We might be,
uh, just a little,

17:18.405 --> 17:20.773
uh, over budget with the,
uh, contractor bids.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.142
How much?

17:22.175 --> 17:23.710
Oh, like 50% over.
50%?

17:23.743 --> 17:25.712
Don't worry about it.
Vito's gonna take care of it.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.314
It's fine.
Why am I not reassured?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.548
DANNY:
You're negative.
Your negative attitude

17:28.581 --> 17:29.582
doesn't help anything.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.784
Doesn't accomplish anything.
Neither does Vito.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.420
You want to talk to me
about my negative attitude?

17:33.453 --> 17:35.255
DANNY: And I'd also like
to talk to you about the fact

17:35.288 --> 17:36.756
that you took way too long

17:36.789 --> 17:39.426
to, uh, put in the thing
for the liquor license.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.261
It's about nine months late.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.430
So that was your fault,
but don't worry.

17:43.463 --> 17:44.664
Vito's gonna take care of it.

17:44.697 --> 17:45.865
That's correct.
All right, good.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.368
You know what's
weird about this?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.270
Who the hell would have thought
the two of you

17:50.303 --> 17:51.871
opening a restaurant together
would cause all this friction?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.540
Hi, Eric.
Gentlemen.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.807
Headmaster Waller's laptop.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.144
Straight from the crime lab.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.811
Did a deep dive on this puppy.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.248
And yes, recovered a bunch
of deleted files,

18:01.281 --> 18:03.683
including this one.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.518
"Dear members of the board
of trustees:

18:05.552 --> 18:07.187
"It is with great sadness
and disappointment

18:07.220 --> 18:08.888
"I'm writing you
to recommend

18:08.921 --> 18:11.891
"the immediate termination
of our head of admissions,

18:11.924 --> 18:13.860
Ms. Meech."
ERIC: Apparently,
this Meech lady

18:13.893 --> 18:16.296
was taking bribes, admitting
certain kids to the school.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.864
STEVE: Wait a minute.
Clearly, this letter

18:17.897 --> 18:19.499
never got sent.
As of this morning,

18:19.532 --> 18:20.767
Meech was still
working there.

18:20.800 --> 18:23.236
Well, the guy might
have changed his mind,

18:23.270 --> 18:24.437
decided to just dump
this e-mail.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.505
ERIC:
Except that's the thing.

18:25.538 --> 18:28.308
This file was deleted
after Waller went missing.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.210
Like, the very next day.

18:30.243 --> 18:33.480
So, who would stand
to gain from doing that?

18:37.917 --> 18:39.519
TANI:
Sweet ride, Ms. Meech.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.289
Looks like business
has been good.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.691
Oh, well,
I got a great deal on it.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.193
Yeah, I'm sure
it was a steal.

18:46.226 --> 18:48.361
Hey, uh, you want
to do me a favor?

18:48.395 --> 18:50.197
Just hang onto this
for a second, okay?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.399
HPD will be by
to pick it up.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.633
What the hell is going on?

18:53.666 --> 18:55.402
Surprise, Meech.

18:55.435 --> 18:56.403
Now we get to
interview you.

19:04.311 --> 19:05.478
MEECH:
This is ridiculous.

19:05.512 --> 19:08.248
I never took a penny
from any of the parents.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.750
No, you were smarter than that.
You took payment in kind.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.252
Right? Luxury vacations.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.854
Holiday rentals.
Expensive meals.

19:14.887 --> 19:16.889
No, that's just gossip.

19:16.923 --> 19:18.325
Oh.
I'm friends

19:18.358 --> 19:19.959
with many of the parents.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.229
I enjoy their company
outside of school.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.497
As far as I'm aware,
that's not a crime.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.799
Is that what you told Waller
when he confronted you about it?

19:28.368 --> 19:30.637
I don't know where
you're getting your information.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.938
We know about the letter, Helen.

19:31.971 --> 19:33.406
On the day he died,

19:33.440 --> 19:34.674
Headmaster Waller
wrote this letter

19:34.707 --> 19:38.678
to the school board,
recommending you be fired.

19:38.711 --> 19:42.249
Later that night,
his wife calls HPD

19:42.282 --> 19:44.351
to report the fact
that he hasn't made it home.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.419
And then less than
12 hours later, this letter

19:46.453 --> 19:47.954
is deleted
from Waller's computer.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.357
And-and you think
that I did that?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.824
TANI:
No, we know you did.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.331
JUNIOR:
See, that's impressive.

19:58.365 --> 19:59.799
You're in and out
of his room

19:59.832 --> 20:00.933
in under 90 seconds.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.602
That's just enough
time to log on

20:02.635 --> 20:04.904
to that computer
and delete that file.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.406
That's right.
Now, if this letter...

20:06.439 --> 20:08.408
had it gone out
to the school board,

20:08.441 --> 20:10.543
that would have meant
the end for you.

20:10.577 --> 20:11.844
And not just
at Lawrence Academy.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.946
So, what do you do?
You go to Waller,

20:13.980 --> 20:16.549
and you beg him
not to ruin your career.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.851
And when he refuses,
you kill him.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.820
And you get his body
off school premises

20:20.853 --> 20:22.689
in the trunk of his car.
Isn't that right?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.557
No.

20:24.591 --> 20:27.394
Okay. Listen.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.462
I did go and see Anthony--

20:29.496 --> 20:32.299
to try and persuade him
not to send the letter.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.867
But he refused,
and that was the end of it.

20:34.901 --> 20:38.571
I came into work the next day
expecting to be fired,

20:38.605 --> 20:40.473
only to hear
he had gone missing.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.974
And you know what?

20:42.008 --> 20:44.977
In that moment,
I saw that as a gift.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.446
A gift from who?

20:46.479 --> 20:47.714
From God, of course.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.317
It was an answer to prayer.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.452
Yeah, I don't... I don't think
that's how that works.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.054
Listen, I had nothing to do
with Anthony's disappearance,

20:55.087 --> 20:57.857
as God is my witness.
JUNIOR: Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey, again, um,

20:57.890 --> 21:00.293
I don't think God's
on your side, Helen.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.495
I think you're playing
for the other guy's team.
Yeah.

21:04.331 --> 21:05.498
STEVE:
Really?

21:06.599 --> 21:08.701
Okay. Thank you.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.603
Looks like we're not
gonna have to ask God

21:10.637 --> 21:12.472
to come and testify
on your behalf after all.

21:12.505 --> 21:13.706
We got some new evidence.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.674
TANI:
Great.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.576
Uh, you're not going
anywhere any time soon,

21:16.609 --> 21:18.511
so just, you know,
get comfortable.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.997
From here,
we have to go on foot.

21:38.030 --> 21:39.799
Lead the way.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.036
Can I get some water?

21:44.070 --> 21:46.706
You drink when we
have the money.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.041
Move!

21:53.880 --> 21:57.116
VITO:
See, Commander McGarrett

21:57.149 --> 22:02.622
and Detective Williams--
these guys are 24-7, 365

22:02.655 --> 22:05.358
keeping these
crime-infested streets

22:05.392 --> 22:07.594
safe for the likes
of you and me.

22:07.627 --> 22:10.062
100% devoted
to doing good deeds.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.731
Honestly, I don't even think

22:11.764 --> 22:13.833
these guys have time
for a sandwich,

22:13.866 --> 22:16.536
no less some itty-bitty thing
like a liquor license.

22:16.569 --> 22:17.970
That's what
happened here.

22:18.004 --> 22:20.773
They didn't submit
the paperwork in time,

22:20.807 --> 22:23.743
and now they're facing
a catastrophe

22:23.776 --> 22:26.813
of opening an Italian restaurant
without any vino.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.948
Marone!
Can you imagine that?

22:28.981 --> 22:31.451
I can, unfortunately.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.620
But there's very little
I can do.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.389
I knew I could count on you.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.892
Wait. Did you just say
you're not gonna help?

22:39.926 --> 22:43.029
'Cause I was really thinking
this was gonna go the other way.

22:43.062 --> 22:44.564
I'm sorry, Mr. Russo.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.165
No, no, no, no, no.
Call me Vito.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.434
We can only issue

22:47.467 --> 22:49.669
a fixed number
of licenses a month.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.170
And if I move up
Mr. McGarrett

22:51.203 --> 22:53.906
and Mr. Williams' application
to the front of the line,

22:53.940 --> 22:56.509
then it means someone else's
gets delayed.

22:56.543 --> 22:59.111
I can live with that.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.580
Someone who was diligent enough

23:00.613 --> 23:02.782
to get their paperwork in
on time.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.151
Hey. Is this your wife?

23:05.184 --> 23:06.185
Hey, ma che bella, huh?

23:06.218 --> 23:09.121
I bet she'd like a nice
romantic dinner for two,

23:09.155 --> 23:10.189
best table in the house.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.859
Beautiful meal and,
with your help,

23:12.892 --> 23:15.628
a nice, cheeky
ziti alla Genovese,

23:15.662 --> 23:16.929
compliments of Uncle Vito.

23:16.963 --> 23:18.665
What about it?
Mr. Russo,

23:18.698 --> 23:22.602
what you're suggesting sounds
an awful lot like a bribe.

23:22.635 --> 23:24.003
A bribe?

23:24.036 --> 23:25.037
No!

23:25.071 --> 23:28.140
All I'm offering is some nice
top-shelf booze

23:28.174 --> 23:30.710
and the best veal Milanese
this side of Italy.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.880
And, in exchange,
maybe you can help

23:33.913 --> 23:37.950
my nephew's application
go to the top of the pile.

23:40.587 --> 23:42.021
Okay.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.457
I see where your head's at.

23:44.491 --> 23:46.893
How about $500?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.067
Whew!

23:55.101 --> 23:57.970
I haven't searched
that hard for nothing

23:58.004 --> 23:59.238
since I broke
Cindy Traill's necklace

23:59.271 --> 24:00.239
while trying to remove her bra

24:00.272 --> 24:02.642
at the Williamsburg multiplex
in ninth grade.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.210
What?
DANNY: That's too much

24:04.243 --> 24:05.945
of the wrong information,
but thank you.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.980
Bottom line--
whoever drove Waller's car

24:08.014 --> 24:10.550
off school grounds wiped it down
before they ditched it.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.485
What about blood evidence?
Yeah, none of that, either.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.854
Not in the trunk of the car
or the cabin.
What you're saying

24:14.887 --> 24:17.156
is that somebody cleaned
this whip from top to tail,

24:17.189 --> 24:19.125
or Waller's body
was not in there.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.126
Which means
it could still

24:20.159 --> 24:21.227
be at that school.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.234
*

24:28.267 --> 24:30.737
STEVE:
What do you got, buddy?
What do you got?

24:30.770 --> 24:32.605
Find it. Go on, go on.

24:33.840 --> 24:35.007
DANNY :
I may have something here

24:35.041 --> 24:38.010
at the construction site.
STEVE: Copy that. Let's go.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.546
Eddie, Eddie.

24:39.579 --> 24:41.013
This way. This way.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.982
DANNY:
Seem weird to you?

24:44.751 --> 24:47.720
STEVE: Yeah, why would they
only pour one of these forms?

24:47.754 --> 24:49.021
Yeah, this finish, man.

24:49.055 --> 24:51.057
This trowel work's
really sloppy.
TANI: Mmm.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.293
Yeah, whoever poured this
was in a rush.

24:54.326 --> 24:56.095
STEVE:
Tani, let's get CSU down here.

24:56.128 --> 24:58.898
Have 'em bring a jackhammer,
please.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.845
Yo! Commander! Commander!

25:12.879 --> 25:14.714
We got something.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.750
We got something.
This could be Waller.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.862
Hey, Commander, over here.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.798
What do you got?

25:31.831 --> 25:32.799
Looks like a gun.

25:37.203 --> 25:38.571
Give me your glove, Eric.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.719
A nine-mil.

25:52.752 --> 25:55.855
TANI: Matches the shell casing
they found in the school.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.957
STEVE: Okay, we have our vic,
our murder weapon.

25:57.990 --> 26:00.326
Now we just need to find out
who pulled the trigger.

26:08.635 --> 26:09.936
If you've got
some kind of plan,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.370
now would be a good time
to let me in on it

26:11.403 --> 26:12.672
before he loses his cool

26:12.705 --> 26:14.006
and puts a bullet
through your head.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.107
I'm working on it.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.143
Work faster.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.897
*

26:50.943 --> 26:53.312
Okay, wait for it.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.816
Here we go.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.185
The gun is registered to...

27:00.419 --> 27:02.388
Jared Barton.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.158
What's with the look?
You know this guy?

27:06.192 --> 27:08.427
TANI: Yeah. He and his wife
hosted the fund-raiser

27:08.460 --> 27:09.461
we went to.

27:09.495 --> 27:12.098
And his construction company
is building this gym.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.775
Jared Barton, Five-O!

27:22.809 --> 27:23.910
Drop the bag!

27:23.943 --> 27:25.044
Hands behind your head!

27:25.077 --> 27:26.846
Interlock your fingers!

27:26.879 --> 27:27.814
Don't move.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.717
Walk.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.453
Steve.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.355
I think we got
the right guy.

27:38.190 --> 27:40.092
Mr. Barton, sorry to keep you
waiting so long.

27:40.126 --> 27:43.329
We, uh... we had to send out
for some money counters

27:43.362 --> 27:45.832
to get a tally on all that cash
you had in the back of your car.

27:45.865 --> 27:47.700
Yeah, it's a lot of money.
I guessed, uh...

27:47.734 --> 27:48.968
I guessed three million.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.136
Yeah.
I was two short.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.403
You got $5 million in there.

27:51.437 --> 27:52.204
You care to tell us

27:52.238 --> 27:53.906
how you got your
hands on that money?

27:53.940 --> 27:55.775
Hmm.
No?

27:55.808 --> 27:57.209
I mean, I've
heard of the, uh,

27:57.243 --> 28:00.046
construction business
being lucrative,

28:00.079 --> 28:02.481
but not...
not that lucrative.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.383
Okay, clearly he's not
gonna tell us anything,

28:04.416 --> 28:06.252
so why don't we tell him
what we know?

28:06.285 --> 28:07.486
We got a warrant for
your company records.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.455
We were able to take a peek
at the books

28:09.488 --> 28:11.057
on that little gym
that you've been building.

28:11.090 --> 28:12.324
Turns out you're taking
a giant bath

28:12.358 --> 28:13.325
on that thing.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.393
Supposed to be
a million dollars

28:14.426 --> 28:15.928
for the whole thing,
and as of now,

28:15.962 --> 28:17.930
you are ten million in expenses.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.866
That's... that's, uh...
that's over budget.

28:19.899 --> 28:21.734
That means you are
either the worst

28:21.768 --> 28:23.269
construction manager
of all time,

28:23.302 --> 28:26.038
uh, or you have been using
that place

28:26.072 --> 28:28.240
to launder big sums of money.

28:28.274 --> 28:31.077
I'm-I'm going
with the latter. Huh?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.879
I'll take it further.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.080
We also think that Waller,

28:34.113 --> 28:35.381
Headmaster Waller, he got a look

28:35.414 --> 28:37.349
at those, uh...
at those books also.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.485
Hey.  Hey.

28:39.518 --> 28:42.088
We found Waller's body

28:42.121 --> 28:44.223
and the gun
that presumably killed him

28:44.256 --> 28:47.059
in a slab of concrete
on your construction site.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.327
You understand?

28:48.360 --> 28:50.029
So you either tell us
what you know,

28:50.062 --> 28:51.397
or you're going down
for this murder.

28:51.430 --> 28:54.033
The crime lab is processing
the gun right now.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.134
Tell them not to bother.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.203
I killed Waller.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.838
And you're right
about the money laundering.

28:58.871 --> 28:59.906
You're right about it all.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.141
Oh. I wasn't expecting that.

29:02.174 --> 29:03.375
Well, since you're
feeling so cooperative,

29:03.409 --> 29:04.510
you want to tell us

29:04.543 --> 29:05.978
who you're laundering money for?

29:06.012 --> 29:07.413
I can do that.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.082
But first I need to know
my family is safe.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.384
Do you have reason to believe
that they're in danger?

29:12.418 --> 29:15.254
My employers are a
Venezuelan drug cartel.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.924
They don't like complications.

29:17.957 --> 29:20.159
I knew that as soon as they
heard about Waller's body,

29:20.192 --> 29:21.994
they'd cut bait
on the operation here.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.362
Which would make you
a dead person.

29:23.395 --> 29:25.097
That's why you got a
trunk full of cash.

29:25.131 --> 29:27.233
You were gonna use it
to disappear.

29:27.266 --> 29:30.236
I deserve prison or worse
for what I did,

29:30.269 --> 29:32.939
but my family,
they knew nothing,

29:32.972 --> 29:35.207
and for all I know,
they are already in danger.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.342
Please.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.948
*

30:06.638 --> 30:08.174
There.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.312
Untie him.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.491
Dig.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.884
*

30:56.989 --> 30:57.957
Hello?
STEVE: Mrs. Barton,

30:57.990 --> 30:59.391
this is Commander
Steve McGarrett of Five-O.

30:59.425 --> 31:00.559
Is everything okay?

31:00.592 --> 31:02.628
We have reason to believe
you're in imminent danger.

31:02.661 --> 31:03.930
It's extremely important
you stay put.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.065
Now, tell me
exactly where you are,

31:06.098 --> 31:07.333
and I'll send the
closest HPD unit

31:07.366 --> 31:08.867
to your location.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.088
Hey. Did you see that before--
that call he got?

31:29.121 --> 31:30.222
What about it?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.090
I was right.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.392
Hideki is taking orders
from someone.

31:33.425 --> 31:35.027
Like that makes a difference
right now.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.396
Unless your plan is to turn
this hole into a tunnel,

31:37.429 --> 31:38.464
you better
find gold soon.

31:38.497 --> 31:40.366
HIDEKI:
Enough!

31:40.399 --> 31:43.102
You bought yourself
another three hours of life,

31:43.135 --> 31:44.370
but your time is up, Noshimuri.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.605
No, no, wait. Wait.

31:47.639 --> 31:49.008
No.
Stop.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.977
Wait. No, it's here.
Stop!

31:51.010 --> 31:53.579
You're done.
There's nothing there.

32:11.497 --> 32:12.631
Stop right there.
Don't move.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.300
Get him out. Now!

32:22.041 --> 32:23.509
So disappointing.
No.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.344
Wait, wait. Let me explain.
That gun's not even loaded.

32:25.377 --> 32:26.678
Stop.
It's true. It's true.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.414
I'd tell you to pick it up
and check for yourself,

32:28.447 --> 32:29.681
but trust me,
you don't want to touch it.

32:29.715 --> 32:32.018
And why's that?

32:32.051 --> 32:34.120
Because 15 years ago,
it was used in a murder.

32:34.153 --> 32:36.155
A local guy killed his
business partner with that gun.

32:36.188 --> 32:37.689
My father tidied up
the whole thing,

32:37.723 --> 32:40.159
but he kept the murder weapon
as an insurance policy.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.593
You're just talking.
No.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.229
No, no.
Saying whatever you
think it'll take

32:43.262 --> 32:45.331
to keep me from rolling your
dead body into that hole.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.332
It's the truth.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.433
And this guy is rich.

32:47.466 --> 32:48.767
Has far too much to lose.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.669
Which makes that gun worth
a lot of money.

32:50.702 --> 32:52.271
More than 20 million, maybe.

32:54.606 --> 32:56.275
And Shioma's money?

32:56.308 --> 32:58.010
You keep that for yourself?

32:58.044 --> 32:59.611
I told you, Michelle was lying.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.680
She didn't tell me
where it's buried.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.050
And as far as I'm concerned,
it's blood money anyway.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.584
I didn't want anything
to do with it

33:05.617 --> 33:07.386
after my father died,
and I still don't.

33:07.419 --> 33:09.355
And it's definitely
not worth my life.

33:10.622 --> 33:12.224
Assuming you're telling
the truth...

33:13.559 --> 33:15.594
...what if this guy
can't afford the blackmail?

33:15.627 --> 33:17.329
ADAM:
Then I'll still owe you.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.298
You take whatever payment
you want.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.300
I should just kill you
right now.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.169
Save myself the wasted time.

33:23.202 --> 33:25.437
You need the name
of the businessman.

33:25.471 --> 33:28.240
You need a little more
information to get him to bite.

33:28.274 --> 33:29.408
Information I can give you.

33:29.441 --> 33:32.544
But that will only happen
if you let me walk out of here.

33:43.255 --> 33:44.323
Thank you.

33:44.356 --> 33:48.594
Hey. Hey, these witnesses here
say that Mrs. Barton

33:48.627 --> 33:50.796
and her daughter were both
abducted by gunmen.

33:50.829 --> 33:52.631
Suspects fled
in a late-model SUV.

33:52.664 --> 33:54.100
We get a plate?
No plate.

33:54.133 --> 33:56.202
However, HPD
identified these three

33:56.235 --> 33:57.369
bodies here.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.239
Over here, you got your two
dead Venezuelan nationals.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.341
They're connected
to the Ramirez cartel.

34:02.374 --> 34:05.211
And this gentleman here was a
bodyguard, a Christopher Deacon.

34:05.244 --> 34:06.745
Okay, the husband
said that he hired

34:06.778 --> 34:08.780
private security
to keep an eye on his family.

34:08.814 --> 34:10.649
So the cartel grabs
Barton's wife and daughter,

34:10.682 --> 34:12.451
and they do it
in broad daylight.

34:12.484 --> 34:15.154
All right, the only reason
they would do that is to

34:15.187 --> 34:17.223
leverage Barton into
giving them their money back.

34:17.256 --> 34:18.490
So, now what?

34:18.524 --> 34:20.092
Let's give them what they want.

34:38.577 --> 34:39.678
Step away from the car.

34:41.213 --> 34:42.448
Where's my family?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.583
Better question:
Where's our money?

34:44.616 --> 34:46.685
You get it when I see
my family is safe.

34:52.624 --> 34:55.394
Unless you want this to be
the last time you see them,

34:55.427 --> 34:56.828
give us the cash.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.874
Let them go.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.312
Actually,
I think you need to pay

35:13.345 --> 35:14.846
for all this trouble.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.449
So now I'm going to kill your
wife and kid while you watch.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.812
Let 'em go!
Drop your weapon! Do it now!

35:46.845 --> 35:49.248
Surprise. He's not listening.

35:49.281 --> 35:52.551
Last chance!
Drop your weapon now!

35:52.584 --> 35:53.685
You got a shot?
Negative.

36:03.595 --> 36:04.563
Well played.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.581
STEVE: You know,
it's interesting.

36:22.614 --> 36:24.583
I just got a call
from the crime lab

36:24.616 --> 36:27.353
that's processing
the gun that...

36:27.386 --> 36:30.222
was used to kill
Headmaster Waller.

36:30.256 --> 36:31.657
The forensic evidence,
unfortunately,

36:31.690 --> 36:35.761
was too degraded to pull
any kind of definitive I.D.

36:35.794 --> 36:37.863
However, they were
able to identify

36:37.896 --> 36:41.767
two DNA markers,
both of which...

36:41.800 --> 36:43.935
show that the shooter
was a female.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.440
When you confessed
to that murder,

36:48.474 --> 36:50.842
you knew your wife was the one
who pulled the trigger.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.778
And now you're
prepared

36:52.811 --> 36:55.314
to spend the rest
of your life in prison

36:55.347 --> 36:58.016
rather than see her do any time
at all

36:58.049 --> 37:00.952
Doesn't sound like you
can prove any of that.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.326
No, I can't.

37:07.359 --> 37:09.328
I can't prove any of that.

37:16.935 --> 37:19.438
Where are you?

37:26.978 --> 37:28.447
This is on me.

37:28.480 --> 37:29.815
I should've never
dragged you into this.

37:29.848 --> 37:31.016
I wanted in. Remember?

37:31.049 --> 37:33.552
I'm shutting
the task force down, Adam.

37:33.585 --> 37:34.820
It's too dangerous.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.622
Look, I understood
the risks.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.923
And with respect,
if I thought

37:37.956 --> 37:39.725
I couldn't handle it,
I'd tell you.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.393
I'm all in--
now more than ever.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.395
You're not shutting
this down.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.998
Look, I was right about Hideki.

37:47.032 --> 37:48.767
He is taking orders
from someone.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.669
And something tells me
whoever it is

37:50.702 --> 37:52.438
orchestrated the move
against the other bosses,

37:52.471 --> 37:54.806
had Agent Fisher
and his family killed.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.343
But I can't shake
this feeling

37:57.376 --> 37:58.810
that there's something else
going on, Steve.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.846
An angle I'm not seeing.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.748
What are you talking about?

38:03.849 --> 38:05.751
Remember what I told you

38:05.784 --> 38:08.320
about my meeting
with Michelle Shioma?

38:08.354 --> 38:11.423
How she said she had information
that would change my life?

38:11.457 --> 38:12.858
Yes, I do.

38:12.891 --> 38:14.626
I remember you said you felt
like she was...

38:14.660 --> 38:16.962
she was messing with you, trying
to get in your head, right?

38:16.995 --> 38:18.330
Yeah.

38:18.364 --> 38:19.998
Well, now I'm not so sure.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.800
Why?
I can't help feeling

38:21.833 --> 38:23.735
there's something else
going on here

38:23.769 --> 38:25.637
and that it's
all connected.

38:30.709 --> 38:33.412
*

38:37.583 --> 38:39.485
Excuse me.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.019
What the hell happened here?

38:41.052 --> 38:44.089
What the hell
happened here?

38:44.122 --> 38:46.892
You want the long
or the short version?

38:46.925 --> 38:49.628
I want the... you got a...
the nightmare version

38:49.661 --> 38:50.829
where this isn't
actually happening

38:50.862 --> 38:53.899
and
Do you have that version?

38:53.932 --> 38:55.567
No.

38:55.601 --> 38:57.636
Then tell me what happened.

38:57.669 --> 39:01.106
Your Uncle Vito asked me
for some cheap labor.

39:01.139 --> 39:03.775
Then he went out
and ran an errand.

39:03.809 --> 39:05.677
Left me to supervise.

39:05.711 --> 39:08.847
Oh. Well, you've done
a fantastic job.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.081
It wasn't my fault.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.518
Vito promised
to be back in two hours.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.785
I waited three.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.087
Eventually,
I had to get back

39:16.121 --> 39:18.457
and run my truck and
make some money.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.426
Trying to get in touch
with him all afternoon,

39:20.459 --> 39:22.461
but it's going straight
to voice mail.

39:22.494 --> 39:24.796
Okay, okay. All right,
I'm-I'm-I'm having a...

39:24.830 --> 39:26.665
a headache.
I got a big headache,

39:26.698 --> 39:29.067
and I got... I got...
I got bad déjà vu happening,

39:29.100 --> 39:31.670
and I'm having a stress-induced
tumor right now,

39:31.703 --> 39:33.805
just so you know
where I am, okay?

39:33.839 --> 39:36.408
Is that a thing?
No, it's not a thing!

39:36.442 --> 39:37.676
You putz.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.677
Hello?

39:38.710 --> 39:39.778
AUTOMATED MALE VOICE:
This is a collect call

39:39.811 --> 39:42.714
from the cell block of
the Honolulu Police Department.

39:42.748 --> 39:44.149
Would you like
to accept the charges?

39:46.151 --> 39:47.919
DANNY:
Bribing a public official?

39:47.953 --> 39:49.488
Seriously?

39:49.521 --> 39:51.590
Something you want to say?

39:51.623 --> 39:52.591
Yeah.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.860
Thanks for paying my bail.

39:54.893 --> 39:56.462
Okay.

39:56.495 --> 39:58.096
Okay, look.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.798
I messed up.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.132
I know.

40:01.166 --> 40:04.603
But I can't be expected
to carry all the blame.

40:04.636 --> 40:07.639
I mean, what the hell
are you guys thinking anyway?

40:07.673 --> 40:09.608
Opening up a restaurant?

40:09.641 --> 40:11.643
That's a terrible idea.

40:11.677 --> 40:12.778
And then add
to the fact

40:12.811 --> 40:15.614
that you two know less
than nothing about the business.

40:15.647 --> 40:17.783
'Cause if you did, you'd know

40:17.816 --> 40:20.218
it's a full-time,
back-breaking grind

40:20.251 --> 40:22.754
just to squeeze out
a few bucks profit.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.623
Not something you do
on the side, you know,

40:24.656 --> 40:26.525
like some kind of a hobby,
because you think

40:26.558 --> 40:29.194
you know a thing or two
about good food.

40:29.227 --> 40:32.598
You know, any schmuck
who watches the Food Network,

40:32.631 --> 40:34.165
he thinks he's an expert.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.801
But you're not special.

40:35.834 --> 40:36.702
You're not even average.

40:36.735 --> 40:40.038
And when it comes
to stuff like this,

40:40.071 --> 40:41.239
you're terrible.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.776
Okay? At least with me around,
you got a fighting chance.

40:44.810 --> 40:45.711
Uh, wow.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.779
I think this has been
a very interesting

40:47.813 --> 40:50.882
learning experience--
and one that we should probably

40:50.916 --> 40:52.150
put behind us now.

40:52.183 --> 40:52.984
So you're saying I'm fired?

40:53.018 --> 40:55.186
The thought had
crossed our mind.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.187
What I'm saying is

40:56.221 --> 40:59.491
that since you so accurately
diagnosed just now

40:59.525 --> 41:01.827
where and how we're going
wrong, that you should

41:01.860 --> 41:03.228
stick around and help us
get it right.

41:03.261 --> 41:05.263
Nobody was
gonna fire you.

41:05.296 --> 41:08.166
That's not true.
Okay, it doesn't matter.
Okay, it's behind us.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.602
It's in the past.
Come over here.

41:10.636 --> 41:11.803
Hug?
Yeah. Come on.

41:11.837 --> 41:12.971
Hey, You, too, sailor.

41:13.004 --> 41:14.640
Get in here.
Coming in, too?

41:14.673 --> 41:16.274
Yeah, come on, sailor.
All right, okay.
That's nice.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.009
Whoa. What is that?
Hmm?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.277
My keys?
No, no.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.679
Over there. Look.

41:20.712 --> 41:21.847
On the TV.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.584
What? What are you
talking about?

41:25.617 --> 41:26.785
This guy.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.587
I-I've seen
this guy before.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.722
Whoa, wait. When did
you see this guy?

41:30.756 --> 41:33.592
Vito, Vito, are you sure
about this?

41:33.625 --> 41:35.694
Of course. I never
forget a face.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.296
About two months ago,
I go to this guy's house.

41:38.329 --> 41:41.166
Quoted him a bathroom
remodel, you know?

41:41.199 --> 41:42.968
He talked my ear off,
then, of course,

41:43.001 --> 41:44.269
I never seen or heard
from the guy again.

41:44.302 --> 41:45.904
Did you mention Danny
to this guy?

41:45.937 --> 41:47.573
Well, actually, I did, you know?

41:47.606 --> 41:49.975
He said he knew some guys
on the Jersey PD,

41:50.008 --> 41:52.043
so I told him about
how my nephew

41:52.077 --> 41:54.946
moved to Honolulu to
become a cop in paradise.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.748
Your Uncle Vito,
that's how he tracked you here.

41:56.782 --> 41:57.849
This guy's from Jersey?

41:57.883 --> 41:59.551
What, this guy,
you know him?

41:59.585 --> 42:01.119
He's a friend of yours?
No, he's not a friend of mine.

42:01.152 --> 42:02.287
He actually tried to kill me.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.590
I don't... I don't...
I don't know who you are.

42:04.623 --> 42:05.857
Should I know who you are?

42:05.891 --> 42:07.058
Pity.

42:09.928 --> 42:10.996
Oh.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.764
And I told him
where to find you.

42:12.798 --> 42:13.999
Oops.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.033
Just...

42:15.066 --> 42:16.167
listen to me for a second.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.603
This... this could be
our only chance

42:17.636 --> 42:19.237
to figure out why this guy
did what he did.

42:19.270 --> 42:20.606
You know...
do you know his name?

42:20.639 --> 42:21.607
Do you know his address?

42:21.640 --> 42:23.174
Think, please.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.116
Everything okay?

42:31.149 --> 42:32.918
JESSIE:
Turn on the news.

42:39.124 --> 42:41.893
Local business magnate
Joshua Stern

42:41.927 --> 42:44.062
was found dead at his home
earlier today

42:44.095 --> 42:47.999
in what HPD are saying
is a suspected suicide.

42:48.033 --> 42:49.000
Is this Hideki's work?

42:49.034 --> 42:50.769
JESSIE:
No. Looks like your guy

42:50.802 --> 42:53.772
didn't have the blackmail money,
so he took the easy way out.

42:53.805 --> 42:55.774
You know what this means,
don't you?

42:55.807 --> 42:57.275
Yeah.

42:57.308 --> 43:00.178
I'm still on the hook
for that 20 million.
