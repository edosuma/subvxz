I was Guero's girlfriend.

you can be relied upon

00:08.740 --> 00:10.605
to do what I need.

00:10.660 --> 00:12.048
I want to be part
of the business.

have come back for me,

00:22.500 --> 00:25.139

and I won't forget it.

It'll be an alliance,

00:36.290 --> 00:38.679
Colonel Vargas,
you're under arrest.

00:38.730 --> 00:41.904
The DA agent that arrested you
has been suspended,

will be dropped.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.217
There's a better way
of doing this

00:52.260 --> 00:53.864

without all this killing.

What do you want, Teresa?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.742
Half of the product
from El Santo.

Say you never found me.

01:01.360 --> 01:02.668
You tried to kill her.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.575
I was 15 feet away from her.

Mom?

01:27.820 --> 01:29.515
Isabela, go to your room.

01:29.560 --> 01:31.164
Together,
we will get our revenge

01:31.220 --> 01:33.347
on the person who took
Epifanio from us.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.733
Epifanio was a man
of the people.

I will capture

you've heard the saying,

"The ends justify the means."

02:01.810 --> 02:04.278
Most people think
that's cruel.

it's another day at
the office.

Luclq for me,

[groans]

02:44.860 --> 02:46.111
In business,

02:46.160 --> 02:48.811
deceit is a valuable currency.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.249
It pays to stay
one step ahead.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.643
And a well-set trap
can be the difference

02:53.690 --> 02:57.558
between another sip of tequila
and the barrel of a gun.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.386

this is time sensitive.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.049
Very.

03:48.090 --> 03:49.819
I have a shipment coming in
tomorrow in the morning.

I'm gonna open
an account with him.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.843
Ah, the cryptocurrency guy. That's cool.

04:01.890 --> 04:03.710
Here's the thing, I can send you a program

04:03.760 --> 04:05.409
that will generate a password,

04:05.460 --> 04:06.540
but even the best of 'em can be hacked,

04:06.590 --> 04:09.104
and I should know.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.764
What do you suggest?

04:10.810 --> 04:12.630
You need to make sure your system is secure.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.205
You know, I'm even better at this stuff in person,

04:15.250 --> 04:16.729
and I'm guessing that Malta

04:16.770 --> 04:19.375
is way better than my shitty condo.

Governor Vargas, you were
elected six months ago,

06:13.060 --> 06:15.665
in the wake of
your husband's murder,

06:15.720 --> 06:18.109
at the hands of
an alleged cartel soldier.

06:18.160 --> 06:21.061
Teresa Mendoza killed
my husband in cold blood.

06:21.110 --> 06:23.465
Mendoza remains a fugitive,

06:23.510 --> 06:26.980
yet the DEA's drug charges
against you have been dropped.

06:27.030 --> 06:28.634
Well, the charges were dropped

06:28.690 --> 06:30.464
because evidence was planted
in my vehicle.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.205
Allegedly planted.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.558
DEA agent Alonzo Loya
remains suspended,

06:35.610 --> 06:37.771
pending further investigation.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.651
Suspension is not enough
for what I endured.

06:40.700 --> 06:45.569
I was falsely imprisoned,
and I nearly lost my life.

06:45.620 --> 06:47.224
But, you know, I think
we should talk about

06:47.270 --> 06:49.352
how we're gonna win this war,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.925
and I believe the only way
to do so is we--

06:51.970 --> 06:54.928
we have to fight corruption,

06:54.970 --> 06:56.881
take it away from its roots.

You know, my focus as a governor
is to stop the drug flow

into the United States.

you're simply doing
nothing more

than riding the coattails of
your husband's popularity.

07:30.230 --> 07:32.482
In fact, your approval ratings

07:32.530 --> 07:35.658
remain far lower than his.

13:18.970 --> 13:21.188
because I am the governor,

13:21.230 --> 13:23.664
and that's the way it's done.

13:23.710 --> 13:27.100
That's the way
it's always been done.

13:27.150 --> 13:30.756
You see, there's nothing new
in our business, my friend,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.846
not even you.

13:32.890 --> 13:34.494
I promise,

13:34.550 --> 13:37.986
I will find out
who's responsnble for our loss.

13:38.030 --> 13:39.986
And now,

13:40.030 --> 13:42.988
for the sake of our children,

13:43.030 --> 13:45.726
_let's not behave
lIke enemies, hm?

14:06.970 --> 14:08.449
[door closes]

14:08.490 --> 14:10.924
[gun clicks]

14:10.980 --> 14:13.107
I was followed,
but I lost them.

14:13.150 --> 14:15.141
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.100
Was it the police or Camila?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.151
I don't know.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.725
Either way...

14:21.770 --> 14:23.590
we have to go.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.245
So, we go to the safe house
and then what, huh?

14:26.300 --> 14:28.074
We leave in the morning?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.906
After our shipment comes in.

14:29.950 --> 14:32.384
We'll have too much cash
to run with.

14:32.430 --> 14:35.160
Oleg promised me a meeting with
the banker, Rocco de la Pea,

14:35.220 --> 14:36.903
who can help us launder it.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.042
Rocco de la Pea's
not the kinda man

14:42.660 --> 14:44.787
We don't have a choice.
[line ringing]

14:44.840 --> 14:46.398
Oleg?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.963
It's me, Teresa.

14:48.010 --> 14:50.535
A pleasure to hear
from you, darling.

14:50.580 --> 14:53.048
Is everything in place
for our shipment tomorrow?

14:53.100 --> 14:56.319
Yeah, but something came up.

14:56.370 --> 14:58.497
The meeting with de la Pea
needs to happen now.

14:58.540 --> 15:00.189
I've waited long enough.

15:00.240 --> 15:02.196
I told you, Teresa,

15:02.240 --> 15:04.379
Rocco is a very busy man.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.763
When I gave you
my European distribution,

15:06.810 --> 15:09.552
you promised me
an introduction would be made.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.295
If you want your shipment
tomorrow,

15:11.340 --> 15:12.944
you will get me a sit-down.

15:12.990 --> 15:16.346
Blackmail?
Not your best look, Teresa.

15:16.390 --> 15:18.608
Either I meet him tonight,

15:18.650 --> 15:20.299
or you won't get your product.

15:22.480 --> 15:24.436
I'll make a call.

15:24.480 --> 15:25.469
[phone beeps]

15:26.490 --> 15:28.833
Such a lovely home, Camila.

15:28.880 --> 15:32.008
But I must say, I was surprised
that you decided to stay here

15:32.060 --> 15:33.960
after losing Epifanio.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.089
Well, thanks to Boaz,

15:35.150 --> 15:36.959
I didn't really
lose him now, did I?

15:37.020 --> 15:39.102
[both chuckle]

15:40.020 --> 15:42.625
Boaz can be a crude man,
but he's a fine partner

15:42.680 --> 15:44.580
for us here in Mexico,
right, to?

15:44.630 --> 15:47.190
CAMILA:
Well, there's another option.

15:47.250 --> 15:50.208
I can take over
the MeXIcan busmess,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.070
with you as my supplier.

15:52.120 --> 15:55.112
I think we can all agree
that Boaz is unstable.

15:55.170 --> 15:59.072
And you think he's just gonna
hand over the cartel?

15:59.130 --> 16:01.030
Your husband sold it to him
before he passed away.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.081
He's a legitimate owner.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.121
I'm aware.

16:05.180 --> 16:08.138
General Cortez is willing
to use his troops

16:08.180 --> 16:09.397
against Boaz's soldiers,

16:09.440 --> 16:10.998
and with my backing
as the governor,

16:11.050 --> 16:14.656
I'm confident we will prevail.

16:14.710 --> 16:16.837
Camila...

16:16.880 --> 16:19.098
when my wife wanted
to return to work

16:19.150 --> 16:21.232
after the birth
of our first child,

16:21.280 --> 16:23.145
I allowed it.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.363
But she soon realized

16:25.410 --> 16:27.230
that her true calling
as a mother

16:27.290 --> 16:29.019
was not on the street.

16:29.070 --> 16:31.800
It was at home
serVIng her family.

16:31.860 --> 16:34.636
Your wife was a wonderful woman,

16:36.860 --> 16:40.159
Look, it's very simple.

16:40.210 --> 16:42.735
If you move against Boaz
without our permission,

16:42.780 --> 16:44.475
we will not only
strike against you,

16:44.520 --> 16:48.081
but we will find
a different cartel to deal with.

16:48.130 --> 16:50.269
[soft, solemn music]

16:50.310 --> 16:53.268
If Epifanio was still here,

16:53.310 --> 16:56.097
he would tell you to relax.

16:56.140 --> 16:59.394
Don't worry about business.

16:59.450 --> 17:02.624
Instead, enjoy the fruits
of your womanhood.

17:05.020 --> 17:06.715
[inhales deeply]

17:06.760 --> 17:08.534

17:33.260 --> 17:35.216
You know what, Teresita,

17:35.270 --> 17:38.694
sometimes I miss Mexico.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.354
There's Oleg.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.278
Where's de la Pea?

17:48.320 --> 17:50.140
In his inner sanctum.

17:50.190 --> 17:53.318
He owns this nightclub,
along with half of Malta.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.235
He calls the shots.

17:55.290 --> 17:56.507
Are you joining us?

17:56.550 --> 17:58.245
Oh, I've done my part
with Rocco.

17:58.290 --> 18:00.338
The fate of tonight's meeting

18:00.380 --> 18:02.689
is entirely
in your hands now.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.329
What is this?

18:06.380 --> 18:08.769
Rocco's big on
first impressions.

18:08.820 --> 18:10.549
You'll see.

18:15.440 --> 18:18.261
[man singing
"Dal tuo stellato soglio"]

18:18.310 --> 18:21.131
ROCCO: Hola, Teresa.

18:21.180 --> 18:24.911
Welcome to my world.

18:24.970 --> 18:27.609
Do you like your song,
Teresa?

18:27.670 --> 18:30.366
I picked it
specifically for you.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.493
The song's about
poor little Moses,

18:33.540 --> 18:35.064
life threatened,

18:35.110 --> 18:37.192
plucked from the jaws
of death

18:37.240 --> 18:39.800
by his enemies,

18:39.850 --> 18:42.068
raised up among his
oppressors,

18:42.120 --> 18:45.283
only to bring ruin upon them.

18:45.340 --> 18:49.333
Those_(_:letails sound
familiar to you?

18:49.380 --> 18:53.293
I discovered quite a bit
about you, Teresa.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.558
I'm_curious
how confident you are

18:55.610 --> 18:58.249
with what I might have found.

18:58.310 --> 19:01.040
Last chance.

19:07.010 --> 19:10.832
And she emerges
from the darkness,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.667
just like a poem.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.064
TERESA:

19:34.340 --> 19:36.558
You're scaring Yvette.

19:36.610 --> 19:39.829
You're embarrassing
yourself, fat man.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.826
Yes, you've proven
what big balls you have.

19:41.870 --> 19:44.998
Now put them back in your pocket
before I eat them.

19:53.490 --> 19:58.018
Wow, I like that.
How much?

19:58.060 --> 20:01.496
I would pay you $1 million
to borrow him for a night.

20:01.540 --> 20:04.282
Let's go.
This is a waste of time.

20:04.330 --> 20:05.627
Teresa, if you walk
out that door,

20:05.680 --> 20:07.841
you will never see me again.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.891
Give me a reason to stay.

20:09.940 --> 20:13.899
_Unlike_ most men
in my line of work,

20:13.950 --> 20:16.680
I prefer to do business
with women.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.686
They are more trustworthy,

20:18.730 --> 20:20.288
more compassionate,

20:20.340 --> 20:22.820
more loyal,

20:22.870 --> 20:24.826
and with the proper training,

20:24.870 --> 20:28.169
they can be
physically equal to a man.

20:28.220 --> 20:31.747
However, when a woman
tries to be a man,

20:31.790 --> 20:33.917
she becomes totally useless,

20:33.970 --> 20:37.349
when she puts business
before love,

20:37.410 --> 20:40.277
when she resorts to betrayal.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.403
Your information is wrong.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.883
I didn't betray anyone,

20:44.930 --> 20:47.103
not even Camila Vargas.

20:47.150 --> 20:48.845
Then you tell me
why you should stay.

20:48.890 --> 20:50.767
You deal in cryptocurrencies:

20:50.810 --> 20:53.540
Bitcoin, Monero, Etherium.

20:53.600 --> 20:56.330
ROCCO:
Your choice. All untraceable.

20:56.380 --> 21:00.339
And for all my magic tricks,
I charge 5%.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.860
You charged the Saudis 3%
for the same process last year.

21:02.910 --> 21:04.684

Someone's being Chatty Cathy,

21:04.740 --> 21:07.732

-Of course.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.174
Six months ago,
my market share

21:14.220 --> 21:17.178
of European distribution
was zero.

21:17.230 --> 21:20.575
Today, I'm moving
30 kilos a week.

21:20.620 --> 21:21.791
Do you want to wait
until I've doubled that

21:21.840 --> 21:23.569
to negotiate with me?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.359
4 points it is.

21:25.410 --> 21:27.184
But I also know your problem

21:27.240 --> 21:30.016
with the incoming shipment
from Bolivia

21:30.070 --> 21:34.109
may render all this haggling
irrelevant.

21:34.160 --> 21:36.583
Oleg will get his shipment,

21:36.640 --> 21:39.598
and your bank will get
my holdings.

21:39.640 --> 21:41.153
Good.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.110
-Bravo.
-Thank you.

and her punching bag

22:44.050 --> 22:46.268
can do their dirty deeds

of a Somali crew landing

with Don Reynaldo went well?

No.

and wants me to be a housewife.

'Cause as large and far-reaching
as my hands are,

24:35.380 --> 24:36.904
I only got two of 'em.

24:36.950 --> 24:38.770
The fine art of delegating

24:38.820 --> 24:40.128
is a prerequisite to power,
Principessa.

24:40.170 --> 24:41.865
I'll handle it myself.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.343
I gotta go on the record and say

24:43.390 --> 24:44.994
that is seriously unwise,
darlin'.

24:45.040 --> 24:47.782
It's my operation, my shipment.

24:47.830 --> 24:49.786
I'll make the decisions.

24:49.830 --> 24:51.786
I ain't gonna argue
with that.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.786
The new guy at the port's
name is Falcn.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.740
He's the easy kind.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.746
Just remember
what Cyndi Lauper said:

24:57.800 --> 24:59.927
"Money changes everything."
[laughs]

24:59.970 --> 25:02.791
Hug Chewy for me.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.319
George is right.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.713
You shouldn't get
your hands dirty with this.

25:06.760 --> 25:09.456
I can handle the bribe
by myself.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.582
You don't handle_numbers
or negotiating.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.153
I do.

25:13.200 --> 25:15.418
Who said anything
about negotiating?

25:15.470 --> 25:18.416
[music builds]

25:26.610 --> 25:27.770
TERESA:
In six months,

25:27.830 --> 25:30.822
we doubled the cash
we left Mexico with.

25:30.870 --> 25:32.781
We made this.

25:32.830 --> 25:36.129
If bribing this port official
goes bad,

25:36.180 --> 25:38.967
we might as well
just burn all of it.

25:39.010 --> 25:41.831
Camila didn't do her dirty work.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.609
Yeah...

25:43.670 --> 25:46.366
and I don't want to do
business like her.

25:46.410 --> 25:48.844
She treats life cheaply.

25:48.890 --> 25:49.788
If you fall,

25:49.850 --> 25:52.489
we all go down, Teresita.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.359
That's just the way it works.

25:54.420 --> 25:56.934
I don't know any other way
for it to work.

25:56.990 --> 25:58.764
I was just offering.

25:58.810 --> 26:00.596
Okay, then.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.460
Then we do this.

26:04.210 --> 26:05.859
Take it.

26:05.910 --> 26:08.868
[tense music]

26:17.880 --> 26:19.780
Okay, close your eyes.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.223
They're closed.

26:22.270 --> 26:23.828
[chuckles]
Mom, no, they're not.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.791
-I can see you.
-[chuckles]

26:25.840 --> 26:28.274
[inhales] Okay.

26:34.150 --> 26:37.108
[soft music]

26:38.460 --> 26:40.109
What do you think?

26:44.950 --> 26:46.338
You look beautiful.

26:49.250 --> 26:51.468
[both chuckle]

26:54.960 --> 26:57.690
-Mom?
-Yes?

26:57.740 --> 27:00.129
-Can I ask you something?
-Of course.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.478
What were you talking
to Boaz about at the party?

27:03.530 --> 27:07.443
And please don't treat me
like a child.

27:07.490 --> 27:08.923
I can handle it.

27:12.710 --> 27:14.666
Colonel Cortez and I

27:14.720 --> 27:17.666
are restructuring
our agreement with Boaz,

27:17.720 --> 27:21.156
putting our house in order.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.896
This business...

27:23.940 --> 27:26.158
and the wealth it generates...

27:27.730 --> 27:30.949
One day may fall
to you to handle.

27:30.990 --> 27:33.948
Not if Cortez steals it
from you first.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.604
I don't know _
how you can trust him

27:35.650 --> 27:38.289
-after all he's done.
-I don't.

27:38.350 --> 27:41.080
I need him for the business.

27:41.130 --> 27:43.348
And he's helping me
search for Teresa.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.300
Well,
I hope he finds her soon.

27:45.350 --> 27:47.830
I want that bitch dead
just as much as you do.

27:47.880 --> 27:49.529
Isabela, don't talk like that.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.968
It's because of her

27:51.010 --> 27:53.831
that Papi won't be here
when I get married.

27:53.880 --> 27:56.360
I always thought
he'd walk me down the aisle.

27:59.240 --> 28:00.753
He would've been happy
for you.

28:00.800 --> 28:02.973
I know.

28:03.020 --> 28:05.193
Ijust miss him so much.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.765
[whispers] Yeah.

28:07.810 --> 28:09.766
Me too.

[tense tone]

28:29.830 --> 28:30.910
TERESA:
Meet us at the port.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.835
I love you.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.131
I love you too.

28:34.190 --> 28:37.091
[tense music]

28:40.150 --> 28:42.710
POTE: George's man is late.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.802
TERESA: If we don't bribe
the port official tonight,

28:45.850 --> 28:48.239
we won't get the shipment
tomorrow.

28:50.070 --> 28:52.675
Always the hard way.

28:54.900 --> 28:56.595
I never asked you,

28:56.640 --> 28:59.029
and you never told me.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.810
Do you have a wife?

29:01.870 --> 29:03.519
Or family?

29:05.260 --> 29:07.956
I'm not always alone.

29:10.310 --> 29:13.006
Is that enough for you?

29:13.050 --> 29:16.008
I was married once.

29:16.050 --> 29:17.927
Didn't work out.

29:17.970 --> 29:20.131
Never told me you had a wife.

29:20.190 --> 29:22.658
Do you tell me about
all the men in your life?

29:22.710 --> 29:26.009
What about kids?

29:26.060 --> 29:29.188
Is there a little Potemkin
out there somewhere?

29:29.240 --> 29:32.061
[chuckles] No.

29:32.110 --> 29:34.158
I left her before that happened.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.588
Why?

29:35.640 --> 29:36.937
'Cause love is
not for everyone.

29:36.990 --> 29:39.948
[tires squealing]
TERESA: There he is.

29:39.990 --> 29:42.948
[dramatic music]

29:49.740 --> 29:52.698
[solemn bass music]

29:55.010 --> 29:56.819
Are you Falcn?

29:56.880 --> 29:59.098
You're late.

29:59.140 --> 30:02.871
I thought I was being followed.
I had to double back.

30:02.930 --> 30:04.830
POTE: Take your hands
out of your pocket.

30:06.580 --> 30:09.538
[hands patting]

30:14.290 --> 30:16.895
He's clean.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.988
Did you bring the money?

30:20.940 --> 30:24.068
Police can be watching.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.941
You give him the money
and we could get arrested.

30:26.990 --> 30:29.129
We walk away now,
the shipment is still coming,

30:29.170 --> 30:30.774
we have no deal.

30:30.820 --> 30:32.868
So, what you wanna do?

30:32.910 --> 30:35.993
We go now and take him with us.

30:36.050 --> 30:37.347
-Walk.
-Hey...

30:37.400 --> 30:38.651
Hey, what's happening?
What is this?

30:38.700 --> 30:41.225
POTE: Run! Run!

30:41.270 --> 30:43.135
_ Run!
[tires screech]

30:43.180 --> 30:44.579
Did you bring 'em, cabrn?

30:44.620 --> 30:46.053
-Did you bring 'em?
-No, no, no!

30:46.100 --> 30:47.442
Hands in the air!

30:47.490 --> 30:50.664
[gunshots]

30:50.710 --> 30:53.144
-Did you bring them?
-No! I said no!

30:53.190 --> 30:54.589
Throw your weapons down

30:54.630 --> 30:57.758
_ and come out _
With your hands in the air!

30:57.810 --> 30:59.152
I'm going to fire again.

30:59.200 --> 31:00.929
Get behind the wheel,
and you step on the gas,

31:00.980 --> 31:02.322
and don't look back,
you understand?

31:02.380 --> 31:04.154
That's not happening.

31:04.210 --> 31:05.939
[apprehensive music]

31:05.990 --> 31:07.764
This doesn't make sense.

31:07.820 --> 31:09.947
If this were a bust, there
would be an army out there.

31:09.990 --> 31:12.072
-Come here.
-What are you doing?

31:12.130 --> 31:13.904
I'm gonna find out
what they want.

31:13.950 --> 31:15.474
Drop your weapons!

31:15.520 --> 31:17.249
Do it!

31:17.310 --> 31:18.698
Now!

31:22.610 --> 31:25.044
All right.

31:25.100 --> 31:26.260
All right, take it easy.

31:26.310 --> 31:28.312
You're not here
to make an arrest.

31:28.360 --> 31:30.089
You have no back-up.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.961
What do you want?

31:33.020 --> 31:34.829
We're here for our cut.

31:34.890 --> 31:37.142
We've been following
Agent Falcn since his transfer.

31:37.190 --> 31:38.748
We knew there'd be
a bribe attempt.

31:38.800 --> 31:41.018
POTE:
And they say Mexico's corrupt.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.719
It's only fair, no?

31:42.770 --> 31:44.192
Or you want to do it
the hard way?

31:44.250 --> 31:47.151
[gunshot]
POTE: Hey!

31:47.200 --> 31:48.508
He said he wanted to
get paid,

31:48.550 --> 31:50.506
-so I paid him.
-It was a mistake.

31:50.560 --> 31:51.857
What's your name?

31:51.910 --> 31:54.117
Daniela...

31:54.170 --> 31:55.592
Spliteri!

31:55.650 --> 31:57.299
You have two choices,
Daniela.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.159
You can die here tonight,

31:59.220 --> 32:01.211
or live to help us with
our shipment in the morning.

32:08.270 --> 32:10.966
Sign the paperwork.
Let them through!

32:11.010 --> 32:14.229
POTE: You almost got yourself
killed last night.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.056
I can spot a dirty cop
as good as you can.

32:20.630 --> 32:23.326
We got the shipment through.

32:23.370 --> 32:26.840
And now we have two port cops
working for us.

32:26.900 --> 32:29.061
We're in an even stronger
position now.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.203
It worked this time.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.241
How 'bout next time, huh?

32:34.300 --> 32:37.428
You cannot build an empire
all on your own, Teresita.

32:39.260 --> 32:41.956
[phone buzzing]

32:51.660 --> 32:53.742
How did you locate her?

33:00.060 --> 33:01.971
What mistake was that?

33:04.330 --> 33:07.276
[tense music]

33:14.290 --> 33:17.589
Patience, Hummer.
Take care where you strike.

-Governor.

33:49.280 --> 33:50.759
You're looking well.

33:50.810 --> 33:53.415
You did good with the drones.

33:53.460 --> 33:56.281
Shall we get down to business?

33:58.810 --> 34:00.687
Absolutely.

MAN: It's gonna take a lot
more than a few downed drones

34:20.180 --> 34:21.522
to get you reinstated.

34:21.580 --> 34:24.538
I just handed you
a 20-kilo bust on a platter,

34:24.580 --> 34:26.138
and you're telling me
that isn't enough?

this intel from,

34:32.850 --> 34:34.932
Maybe it's time to let this go.

34:34.980 --> 34:36.845
Find something else.

34:38.420 --> 34:39.978
There is nothing else.

34:46.300 --> 34:47.813
When you reached out to me
two months ago,

34:47.860 --> 34:49.942
I thought this was a crazy idea.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.683
CAMILA: What?

34:51.740 --> 34:55.176
For a Mexican governor
to help bring down a narco?

34:55.220 --> 34:57.950
That's why I was elected.

34:58.000 --> 35:00.651
You want Boaz Jimenez
out of your hair.

35:01.830 --> 35:06.267
You know,
there's people in my state

35:06.320 --> 35:09.141
that have doubts
about my competence.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.011
There are those who think
that a woman

35:12.060 --> 35:15.052
isn't worthy to fill
her husband's shoes.

35:16.330 --> 35:19.197
You deliver Boaz
to your superiors,

35:19.240 --> 35:21.322
and you will be reinstated,

35:21.380 --> 35:24.417
and my approval ratings
will soar.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.813
It works well for both of us.

35:26.860 --> 35:29.727
[dark ambient music]

35:29.770 --> 35:32.204
Why'd you choose
to come to me, Camila?

35:32.260 --> 35:35.297
-It was a risk.
-[chuckles]

35:35.350 --> 35:37.568
There's no gain without risk.

35:37.610 --> 35:40.386
And despite the fact that...

35:40.440 --> 35:42.431
we've been adversaries,

35:42.480 --> 35:45.745
I believe you're
a decent man, Alonzo.

35:45.790 --> 35:48.520
I just gambled on you being
a pragmatic one too.

Have you told Cortez
about our arrangement yet?

36:02.370 --> 36:04.679
CAMILA: He knows I've been
leaking information

36:04.720 --> 36:07.280
to someone inside the DEA,

36:07.330 --> 36:09.855
and that's all he needs
to know about this.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.549
Now...

36:11.600 --> 36:14.205
to you...

36:14.250 --> 36:16.332

36:21.700 --> 36:24.339
To Governor Vargas.

Salud.

36:42.280 --> 36:44.236
I got some serious
judging to do.

36:44.280 --> 36:46.840
I thought the pageant that you
were sponsoring was next week.

36:46.900 --> 36:49.414
It is.
I'm picking the winner tonight.

36:49.460 --> 36:53.248
CORTEZ: We have important business to discuss, my friend.

36:53.290 --> 36:55.246
Tell Camila
she'll have to wait.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.291
_ There's no need
to involve the governor.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.252
This business is between
the two of us.

37:03.300 --> 37:04.699
Very good.
