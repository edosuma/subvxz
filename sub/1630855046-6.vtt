WEBVTT

00:17.642 --> 00:19.185
Don't move. I got it.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.689
You're staying with us
until you're 100 percent.

00:22.689 --> 00:26.609
We'll make you better, <i>oba-chan.</i>
Right, Mommy?

00:26.609 --> 00:28.069
Of course. Yeah.

00:28.069 --> 00:30.029
Fumi, we're here for you.

00:30.029 --> 00:32.198
Thank you, Amy.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.826
I wish the cameras had been on.

00:34.826 --> 00:36.619
You don't remember anything else?

00:36.619 --> 00:40.206
I told the police everything.
Try remembering more, Mom.

00:40.206 --> 00:44.169
You stopped by the house
and you turned off the security system?

00:44.169 --> 00:47.338
- Sorry, what time was that exactly?
It's all a blur.

00:47.338 --> 00:49.758
You were looking
for a photo of Dad and then what?

00:49.758 --> 00:52.927
You saw a very white man
and a small Latino?

00:52.927 --> 00:55.221
Stop, please.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.641
I don't want to think about it anymore.

01:01.269 --> 01:06.483
You know, I need an orange soda
from the vending machine.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.321
No sweat. I'll get it right now.

01:11.321 --> 01:12.822
Can I press the buttons?

01:12.822 --> 01:15.200
Of course you can.
Come on. Let's go.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.343
So glad you're okay, Fumi.

01:34.093 --> 01:36.638
I'm sorry to trouble you with all of this.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.555
No.

01:37.555 --> 01:41.976
I know you have a lot on your plate.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.188
Not at all.

01:46.064 --> 01:46.940
Mom?

01:48.024 --> 01:49.567
Can I get candy?

01:50.360 --> 01:51.778
Sorry, sweetie. It too late.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.572
Junie, tell Daddy to get me candy

01:55.281 --> 01:56.741
and I'll share with you.

01:58.618 --> 01:59.577
Mom?

02:09.462 --> 02:12.757
What a joy it is
to be in the Lord's presence today.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.885
Let's raise it up to our Lord and savior.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.810
<i>♪ I raise a hallelujah ♪</i>

02:25.270 --> 02:28.731
<i>♪ In the presence of my enemies ♪</i>

02:31.025 --> 02:35.363
<i>♪ I raise a hallelujah ♪</i>

02:37.198 --> 02:40.618
<i>♪ Louder than the unbelief ♪</i>

02:42.704 --> 02:45.665
<i>♪ I raise a hallelujah ♪</i>

02:45.665 --> 02:48.668
Okay, here we go.
"My weapon is a melody..."

02:48.668 --> 02:51.796
<i>♪ My weapon is a melody ♪</i>

02:54.048 --> 02:58.553
<i>♪ I raise a hallelujah ♪</i>

03:01.347 --> 03:02.849
Hallelujah!

03:02.849 --> 03:03.933
Whoo!

03:05.059 --> 03:07.020
Here we go, God!

03:07.645 --> 03:09.355
Yes, Jesus!

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
<i>I thought he was under house arrest.</i>

03:14.193 --> 03:15.987
He got a religious exemption.

03:15.987 --> 03:18.114
Thank God.
He's been such a dick.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.242
Hey, I told you guys not to do it.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.619
I called it off.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.330
- Yeah, we fucked up for sure.
- You pitched it so good.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.373
- What did you want us to do?
- See this shit?

03:27.373 --> 03:30.126
This shit's real money.
Shit you can buy fucking shit with.

03:30.126 --> 03:33.046
You see this? You can't. It's vase money.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.174
All right, I let that plant lady
get the best of me.

03:36.174 --> 03:39.093
Okay, psychologically,
but it's all over now.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.178
It's fucked up.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.722
I'm using my connects
to get you free materials.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.224
I set up all this church shit

03:44.224 --> 03:47.393
while you fucking idiots
are playing <i>Ocean's 9-11.</i>

03:48.853 --> 03:51.064
- Hey, that's a joke.
- I got it.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.901
- Fucking laugh when something's funny.
- Okay.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.153
I'm gonna keep all this fucking money
to myself.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.030
We'll split the next one. Cool?

03:59.030 --> 04:02.575
- My parents' land, man...
All right. We're all set?

04:02.575 --> 04:03.576
Yeah.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.163
Yo, look at all this eye candy.

04:07.163 --> 04:09.582
No parole officer, all this storage.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.252
I should just move in here.

04:16.047 --> 04:19.092
Take out that wall. Open this up.

04:19.092 --> 04:21.886
More curves to humanize the space.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.180
Humanize the space, Mommy.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.099
Don't say that, Junie. Okay?

04:26.099 --> 04:29.269
She's been like this all morning.
I think the doctor prescribed her

04:29.269 --> 04:30.603
too strong of a painkiller.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.813
I feel nothing.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.232
I feel like how this house must feel.

04:34.232 --> 04:36.776
Fumi, why don't we save
all your great renovation ideas

04:36.776 --> 04:37.819
for your next home?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.821
Oh, please,
like I have the money for that.

04:39.821 --> 04:40.905
But I get it.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.408
Why make changes
if you may not stay together?

04:46.369 --> 04:48.288
- What?
- If you're gonna split up,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.373
- it's not worth the headache.
- Fumi, please?

04:50.373 --> 04:52.625
Mom, where is this coming from?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.794
Must be the pills.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.796
My tongue is loose.

05:01.801 --> 05:04.971
Uh, George, I'm gonna help your mom
get settled in.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.557
You wanna go to the store
and grab her favorite snacks?

05:07.557 --> 05:08.933
Yeah. Great idea.

05:08.933 --> 05:13.479
I'm gonna go past Kōyōhaus.
Do you need me to bring anything home?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.690
If it's not too much of a hassle,

05:15.690 --> 05:18.901
Mia's there, so she can give you
the paperwork I need.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.029
- I'm on it. No worries.
- Thanks, babe.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

05:25.825 --> 05:30.038
Yeah. No, for real.
But, like, I had no friends.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.581
So I played with bugs outside,

05:31.581 --> 05:33.166
I played with insects,

05:33.166 --> 05:36.085
and I'd bring these crickets inside
to play with my G.I. Joes,

05:36.085 --> 05:39.213
and they all hung out in this fort
from this show called <i>BraveStarr,</i>

05:39.213 --> 05:41.215
which you don't know about but--

05:41.215 --> 05:44.594
I don't know what crickets ate.
I gave them cookies and they all died.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.887
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.056
Why didn't you just ask your parents
for a dog?

05:48.056 --> 05:50.975
Korean kids, you couldn't ask
for that kind of stuff back then.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.269
Like that happened after 1990.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.146
This guy knows. Look at him.

05:55.146 --> 05:58.357
Okay, I had a chihuahua named Bella.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.070
She was very cute. Very cute.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.323
Hey, but you know what Danny did?

06:05.323 --> 06:08.367
One day, he found a injured crow

06:08.367 --> 06:11.579
and he nursed it back to health
by feeding it my dead crickets.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.582
- Yeah, he did that.
- What? I had never heard this.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.044
Uh, yeah, I was super young.

06:18.044 --> 06:22.215
Um, I saw that crow like for years
after that. It was weird.

06:23.257 --> 06:25.968
So kind.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.055
Danny was always so good
with animals growing up.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.349
Should we start cleaning up?

06:31.349 --> 06:32.934
I gotta get ready for practice.

06:32.934 --> 06:34.227
Practice for what?

06:34.227 --> 06:36.687
We have our church basketball tournament
coming up.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.606
Yeah. Edwin's team wins every year.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.858
Yo, ball is life, man. Let us play.

06:40.858 --> 06:42.735
- Danny, he's real good.
It's all good.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.862
- Deadline's passed.
- Deadline?

06:44.862 --> 06:48.491
Yeah. I'm so sorry,
the signups ended a couple of weeks ago.

06:48.491 --> 06:51.828
Put me in, coach.
I get messy in the paint like Picasso.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.330
- Yeah, Edwin. Come on.
- Yeah, come on, Edwin.

06:55.456 --> 06:58.501
You know what?
I'll check in with the other teams.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.045
- It's not up to me, unfortunately.
- It's not up to him.

07:01.045 --> 07:03.923
I got you, bro.
I'll check with the other teams.

07:06.801 --> 07:07.677
Oh.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.972
Yo, you see how I do?
You see how fucking I do?

07:10.972 --> 07:13.641
You see Esther basically eye-fuck me
in front of everyone?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.101
You see me fuck Edwin?

07:15.101 --> 07:17.395
We're still on church property, dude.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.688
Sorry, Jesus.

07:18.688 --> 07:19.856
Yo, yo, hold up.

07:20.606 --> 07:21.649
Take this.

07:23.067 --> 07:25.445
That's your cash
for setting up all this church shit.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
Hey, don't tell Bobby or Michael.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.283
Thanks, man.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.995
I know it's not enough for your parents,
but I gotta get mine too.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.456
Yeah, of course, right.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.749
Look, I know you wanna be
in the driver's seat,

07:38.749 --> 07:41.627
but you gotta trust me and
just let me drive for a little bit, okay?

07:45.131 --> 07:46.007
Okay.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.050
Once me and Esther start dating,

07:48.050 --> 07:50.636
I'll set you up with one of her friends.
All right?

07:50.636 --> 07:51.929
I got you, bro.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.223
- I'm always thinking about you.
- Cool, man. Yo...

07:55.141 --> 07:56.225
Thanks, Isaac.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.616
Hershey's Kisses?

08:17.246 --> 08:18.956
Hey, Fumi. Your bed is ready.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.797
Hi, honey. How's the store?

08:26.797 --> 08:29.342
<i>Good. I just ran into Naomi.</i>

08:29.342 --> 08:30.718
Oh. How's she doing?

08:30.718 --> 08:33.554
<i>I guess she's starting
some neighborhood watch?</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.139
Wow, she's so thoughtful.

08:35.139 --> 08:37.683
<i>Yeah, she wanted to talk to Mom
about the robbery.</i>

08:37.683 --> 08:38.935
<i>She's gonna swing by.</i>

08:38.935 --> 08:40.102
Right now?

08:40.102 --> 08:43.189
<i>- Yeah, she just left Kōyōhaus.</i>
- Oh.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.441
It'll be good to catch up with her.

08:45.441 --> 08:47.693
<i>Is everything okay with the deal?</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:50.071
Uh, I think so. Why?

08:50.696 --> 08:53.533
<i>- She seemed worried.</i>
- Oh.

08:53.533 --> 08:56.369
<i>Is there anything I can do to help?
Should I sell the Tamago?</i>

08:56.369 --> 08:58.246
<i>I'll do it. Whatever you need.</i>

08:58.246 --> 09:00.248
Oh, my God. No, babe.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.208
Don't worry about it. I'll sort it out.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.502
<i>Okay. I'll be home soon. Love you.</i>

09:04.502 --> 09:05.503
Love you.

09:07.672 --> 09:10.883
- What's going on with the deal?
- Uh, nothing.

09:12.134 --> 09:14.178
Fumi, I think it's time
for another Percodan.

09:14.178 --> 09:16.430
Already? Are you sure?

09:18.015 --> 09:18.891
Yeah.

09:26.649 --> 09:28.192
You have to go?

09:28.192 --> 09:29.235
Yeah.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.241
We're not gonna talk anymore, are we?

09:37.994 --> 09:40.037
I think my mom suspects something.

09:41.872 --> 09:42.957
Well, it's, um...

09:44.542 --> 09:46.877
It's been a really nice couple weeks.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.380
Yeah. It has.

09:51.340 --> 09:54.218
Okay. Take care of yourself.

09:58.180 --> 10:01.392
Oh, and if you know
of any galleries hiring...

10:03.019 --> 10:03.936
Oh.

10:04.604 --> 10:05.980
No, never mind.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.321
<i>It's up to 86,</i>

10:13.321 --> 10:16.032
<i>the home team
trying to hang on to this lead,</i>

10:16.032 --> 10:18.326
<i>so they are really applying pressure.</i>

10:18.326 --> 10:22.163
<i>Rebound, Anderson, and it's good...</i>

10:22.163 --> 10:23.247
Buckets.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.457
Oh, my--

10:25.249 --> 10:27.668
- Damn it.
<i>- Our home team was out ahead.</i>

10:27.668 --> 10:30.254
<i>- And he gets the entry pass.</i>
- Buckets.

10:30.254 --> 10:33.132
<i>- Davis off the front of the iron.</i>
- Hey.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.259
<i>Just out of the timeout...</i>

10:36.385 --> 10:37.345
Hey!

10:38.596 --> 10:41.432
- Through this, dribble, hop...
- Okay, okay.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.850
- ...finger roll.
- Damn!

10:42.850 --> 10:43.976
Get that.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.228
This is called the opulent squirrel.

10:46.228 --> 10:47.855
- Gotta slide in...
What?

10:47.855 --> 10:50.483
...gotta spin, left-handed, in.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.651
- Fuck you.
- Whoo!

10:52.443 --> 10:54.362
Why is that called the opulent squirrel?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.283
- Fuck!
- Yeah! Let's go!

10:59.283 --> 11:00.660
This is called the break-in.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.829
Hey, hey, get out of here!

11:04.413 --> 11:05.956
Hey, get out of here.

11:05.956 --> 11:08.042
Who am I? I'm Paul.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.126
What the fuck is that?

11:09.126 --> 11:12.755
So I got H-O-R-S, you got H-O-R-S.
What are you gonna do?

11:12.755 --> 11:14.256
This is called the blue collar.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.177
- Two shovels?
- Yeah. Just two.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.304
Okay. One, two...

11:21.472 --> 11:23.641
- Oh, fuck!
- You missed! You missed!

11:23.641 --> 11:25.810
- That was so easy!
- Get out of here!

11:25.810 --> 11:26.727
Fuck!

11:30.356 --> 11:31.607
I'm broke, man.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.527
Like, can't-do-nothing broke.

11:35.903 --> 11:37.113
How much you need?

11:37.113 --> 11:40.408
I don't wanna borrow money.
I want a regular paycheck.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.910
You got any construction work I could do?

11:42.910 --> 11:46.831
Yeah, I mean, there's work,
but, you know...

11:47.456 --> 11:50.543
truth is,
company's under Isaac's name now.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.586
Means you gotta
smooth things over with him.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.882
Yo, that girl got me fucked up, man.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.468
Got me thinking it's all easy.

11:59.468 --> 12:01.971
Yeah, man. I mean she's white, right?

12:03.597 --> 12:05.474
You know, the thing I realized about life

12:05.474 --> 12:09.061
is that it's about compromise, you know?

12:09.061 --> 12:14.316
Like, I thought I was Webber,
but I might be Stojaković, right?

12:14.316 --> 12:17.736
Like, Isaac got the connects,
he knows what he's doing.

12:17.736 --> 12:20.156
Might take a minute
for Mom and Dad to get back,

12:20.156 --> 12:22.867
but, you know,
he's bringing in real money.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.952
You know what I realized?

12:26.078 --> 12:30.666
I'm realizing, like,
money is really important.

12:31.167 --> 12:35.337
You know what, why don't you
come down to church, talk to Isaac, man?

12:35.880 --> 12:38.507
Play ball with us in the tournament.
We need you.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.800
Yeah, you do.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.225
Wanna talk about something?

12:49.393 --> 12:50.978
- No, I'm good.

12:53.397 --> 12:54.940
We don't have to talk about Kayla.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.571
But when a door closes,
just lock that shit, you know?

13:00.571 --> 13:01.989
Then she's outside.

13:01.989 --> 13:06.035
You walk upstairs, open a window,
watch her wander the streets.

13:06.827 --> 13:07.661
Easy.

13:08.829 --> 13:14.543
I mean, yeah, like, it's fine
because I broke up with her. So...

13:15.628 --> 13:16.837
I'm the trash man.

13:17.546 --> 13:19.215
That's right. That's what we do.

13:20.508 --> 13:21.383
Cho bros.

13:21.383 --> 13:23.219
Mm. Cho bros.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.979
- Naomi. Hi! Oh, cute outfit, girl.
Hi!

13:33.979 --> 13:37.233
Aw, you're so sweet.
I'm still not over your hair.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.609
Oh, it's fun, right?

13:38.609 --> 13:41.153
So much fun. Hey, where's Fumi?

13:41.153 --> 13:42.947
Oh. I think she's at the patio.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.575
Oh, no.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.411
God, poor thing.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.915
She must be so tired
after everything she's been through.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.668
Right. She's been through a lot.

13:56.710 --> 13:59.880
Naomi, we should probably reschedule.
Right? I mean...

14:03.717 --> 14:05.010
What's going on, Amy?

14:06.554 --> 14:07.555
Are you okay?

14:08.055 --> 14:09.890
Uh, what do you mean?

14:11.141 --> 14:13.352
Come on, girl, you can tell me.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.937
I'm your friend.

14:14.937 --> 14:19.108
You know, we are two Asian sisters
supporting one another.

14:19.108 --> 14:21.527
Naomi, I love that about us.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.240
So?

14:28.367 --> 14:31.245
So... what?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.207
Okay.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.043
Okay, Amy.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.211
Okay.

14:39.211 --> 14:45.134
Well, two cars got in
a crazy road rage incident on our streets,

14:45.134 --> 14:47.177
one of them was a white SUV.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.973
- You drive a white SUV.
- A lot of people drive a white SUV.

14:50.973 --> 14:55.895
Yeah, I know, but that heckler in Vegas
said some very, very specific things--

14:55.895 --> 14:58.898
That was a random drunken tourist.
Remember, even Jordan agreed--

14:58.898 --> 15:01.817
- Let's say I agreed.
- Good. We'll agree to agree.

15:01.817 --> 15:04.945
A neighbor caught this
on their security camera.

15:06.530 --> 15:12.453
Amy, The Chosen Ones, Incorporated
is owned by Isaac Cho.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.414
He's the cousin of Daniel Cho,

15:15.414 --> 15:18.334
the man with whom
you got into a road rage,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.252
the man with whom...

15:22.755 --> 15:24.298
you're having an affair.

15:29.970 --> 15:34.558
I spoke to Mia, and she said that
you and George are having some issues,

15:35.059 --> 15:37.645
I know a handyman urinated
in your bathroom.

15:37.645 --> 15:40.314
Daniel Cho's a handyman you broke up with,

15:40.314 --> 15:42.107
your jilted ex-lover--

15:42.107 --> 15:44.234
- This isn't funny.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.653
Oh, my God, Naomi.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.863
Okay.

15:47.863 --> 15:49.114
Thank you. Um--

15:50.240 --> 15:52.034
I really needed that. Uh...

15:52.034 --> 15:53.911
That is quite the story.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.412
These are all facts.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.582
Those were all separate events
that have occurred.

15:58.582 --> 16:02.169
I just hadn't quite
pieced them together like that

16:02.169 --> 16:05.756
because, well,
I would love to have the time

16:05.756 --> 16:08.884
to get as creative as you seem to be,

16:09.385 --> 16:11.428
but shit, Naomi...

16:12.596 --> 16:14.306
I'm always busy working.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.104
I'm gonna find the other driver,

16:21.522 --> 16:23.691
and I'll confirm you were driving

16:23.691 --> 16:26.110
because I do have
all the time in the world,

16:26.110 --> 16:29.571
time to meet up with Jordan,
time to tell her everything,

16:29.571 --> 16:35.411
and I doubt she'll want to
acquire a business with so much liability.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.289
Thanks for the heads up.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.292
You go keep yourself busy.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.683
Fuck.

16:58.475 --> 16:59.435
Paul.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.856
Isaac, I think Paul has
something to say to you.

17:03.856 --> 17:08.277
I guess, what I'm trying to say is...

17:10.612 --> 17:13.407
with whatever happened,
I'm down to move forward.

17:16.452 --> 17:18.746
He's talking about Vegas. Right, Paul?

17:20.664 --> 17:23.584
He has some more shit he has to say.
Right, Paul?

17:23.584 --> 17:24.501
I guess.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.670
What the fuck?

17:27.463 --> 17:29.923
What are you doing? What are you doing?

17:29.923 --> 17:31.633
All right, fine. I'm sorry.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.886
Okay?

17:33.886 --> 17:36.180
I'm really sorry. I fucked up.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.936
All right. See? That's all you had to say.
Come on, bring it in. Bring it in.

17:45.314 --> 17:48.317
- Oh, Cho family got the crown jewels.

17:48.317 --> 17:50.736
- Mongol in our blood.
- Okay, we're good.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.529
Family business, back on. All right.

17:52.529 --> 17:55.949
Paul, go introduce yourself
to Bobby and Michael outside.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.997
- All right, man.
- Hey. Let me show you something.

18:03.415 --> 18:06.877
The ones on this side
are regular melodic rice cookers.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.213
They play "Ode to Joy."
You paying attention?

18:09.213 --> 18:10.631
- Yeah.
- It's important.

18:10.631 --> 18:14.176
This side, they play
Kelly Clarkson's "Since U Been Gone."

18:14.176 --> 18:16.053
- You know Kelly Clarkson?
- Mm-hm.

18:16.720 --> 18:19.056
These ones have all my cash.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.477
I'm gonna wall off this area
so no one sees it.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.895
How much cash is that?

18:24.895 --> 18:28.607
A lot. I got a lawyer,
she thinks she can keep me out of jail.

18:28.607 --> 18:29.608
Oh, word?

18:29.608 --> 18:34.404
Yeah. Since Paul stole the truck,
that's gonna soften crossing state lines.

18:34.404 --> 18:37.032
Casino footage
has security fucking you up first,

18:37.032 --> 18:38.826
then my guy at the construction site,

18:38.826 --> 18:41.328
he's gonna say
the whole thing was a miscommunication.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.331
Like fucking Houdini, man.

18:44.331 --> 18:47.209
Yeah. Italians. Peninsula mentality.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.421
Is he Italian? I don't think he is.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.464
He is to me.

18:53.757 --> 18:58.095
Okay. Isaac, why are you showing me this?

18:58.095 --> 19:00.347
Why? You're my fucking family, dude.

19:00.347 --> 19:03.142
- Don't tell Bobby or Michael. I trust you.
- Okay.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.726
- I trust you.
- I got you.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.770
- Say, "Kelly Clarkson."
- Kelly Clarkson.

19:09.773 --> 19:13.277
Look at that. He fits right in.
Yeah, I guess so.

19:13.777 --> 19:17.614
Look, after the lawyer does her thing,
let's just go full hog.

19:17.614 --> 19:20.200
Expand. Construction. Import-export.

19:21.076 --> 19:24.037
Bobby'll take the west side,
the ginger will take the east.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.415
- You get Orange County.
- Word.

19:27.749 --> 19:31.044
And your brother, maybe he gets Oxnard.

19:32.421 --> 19:34.173
This is basketball camp.
- All right.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.759
- Oh, shit. Okay. Check.
I appreciate that.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.909
Thank you for meeting me.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.370
So, what? Waving the white flag, huh?

20:06.246 --> 20:08.290
Look, you fucking idiot,

20:08.290 --> 20:11.960
your stupid robbery stunt
has us both in deep shit, okay?

20:12.544 --> 20:14.713
What--? I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:14.713 --> 20:18.759
Tell your friend,
or your employee, or whoever the fuck,

20:18.759 --> 20:23.180
to maybe not wear a company T-shirt
when committing a crime.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.099
"The Chosen Ones"?
That's the dumbest name I've ever heard!

20:26.099 --> 20:29.478
It's not-- What the fuck is a Kōyōhaus?
"Kōyōhaus!"

20:29.478 --> 20:32.564
The guy whose lawn we destroyed
is out for blood.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.609
He has footage of both of our cars
and wants to press charges.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.069
You don't understand.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.571
These people have nothing better to do.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.702
I'll text you this neighborhood tip line,
and you're gonna call it.

20:46.411 --> 20:50.374
I need you to take the fall and say
that someone else was driving a white SUV.

20:50.374 --> 20:52.167
Why the fuck would I do that?

20:52.167 --> 20:55.212
Because I'm gonna pay you
a lot of money, dipshit.

20:56.672 --> 20:57.547
Okay.

20:58.465 --> 21:01.009
Yeah, I'll do that. $100,000.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.637
Oh, my God. I was gonna offer you 10.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.638
Ten dollars?

21:04.638 --> 21:08.517
You are so stupid! What? $10K!

21:09.768 --> 21:11.186
I'll do it for $50,000.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.024
Twenty-five, final offer.

21:19.069 --> 21:22.906
Okay, but only if you apologize
for honking at me. You started this.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.283
- Me?
- Yeah.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.202
Okay, you backed into me like a psycho.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.788
You flipped me off,
all 'roided out and shit.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.832
I wouldn't push it, Daniel. Okay?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.376
Especially with your
little construction business.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.003
We both know you need this money.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.546
Still stalking me, huh?

21:38.547 --> 21:39.798
Get off my jock.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.008
Oh, my God.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.594
Wait a minute, are you in love with me?

21:44.594 --> 21:47.180
No! I'm worried about you! Okay?

21:47.180 --> 21:49.349
I care about small businesses.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.185
You know what?
My business is a small business.

21:52.185 --> 21:55.731
Your business is
more of like a... micro-business.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.984
It's not a micro-business.
It's a magnum opus business.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.404
Yeah, maybe it could be. With my help.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.698
We're on the same page here.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.783
And if we weren't,
I'd have to flip the page

22:06.783 --> 22:10.454
to a whole other chapter
that you're not prepared to handle.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.664
- You're not.
- Are you threatening me?

22:12.664 --> 22:15.709
Because I could go back
and read that last chapter.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.795
I could also read the new one,
and be aware of both.

22:18.795 --> 22:20.756
Okay, enough. I'm not threatening you.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.382
A threat would sound like,

22:22.382 --> 22:26.178
"Do as you're told
or I will motherfucking bury you."

22:27.763 --> 22:30.557
Hey! Are you guys leaving,
or are you just gonna sit there?

22:30.557 --> 22:32.476
I'll leave when I wanna leave, bitch.

22:32.476 --> 22:34.603
We'll keep sitting here,
you shriveled nut.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.772
Fuck you.
- What the fuck you say?

22:36.772 --> 22:39.900
- What the fuck you say?
- I dare you to say it again!

22:39.900 --> 22:40.817
Come here!

22:40.817 --> 22:42.903
- Say that shit again, motherfucker.
- Psychos.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.905
You're a fucking psycho!

22:53.455 --> 22:54.289
Fine.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.374
$25,000.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.336
All right.

23:11.389 --> 23:13.475
What you got, Naomi? I'm ready.

23:13.475 --> 23:17.062
<i>Hey, Amy. Hi.
I'm just calling to say I'm sorry.</i>

23:18.271 --> 23:19.189
Oh.

23:19.189 --> 23:22.943
<i>Obviously, I didn't know
you were covering for Fumi.</i>

23:25.195 --> 23:26.029
Right.

23:27.114 --> 23:27.989
Now you know.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.408
<i>She called
because she overheard our conversation.</i>

23:30.408 --> 23:32.994
<i>She felt so bad and explained everything.</i>

23:32.994 --> 23:34.996
<i>Being terrorized by that truck,</i>

23:34.996 --> 23:38.041
<i>and now the robbery,
they've gotta be connected.</i>

23:39.459 --> 23:42.170
Yeah, you know, Naomi,
I wanted to tell you,

23:42.170 --> 23:46.591
but I just didn't wanna
embarrass my mother-in-law like that.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.761
I mean, you get it.
We look after our elders.

23:49.761 --> 23:54.224
<i>Absolutely. You did the right thing.
I'm gonna help find the other driver.</i>

23:54.224 --> 23:57.060
<i>I still think it's one of the Cho cousins.</i>

23:57.060 --> 24:00.730
- Yeah. Well, let me know how I can help.
<i>- You're so sweet.</i>

24:00.730 --> 24:04.151
<i>Oh! And I connected George with Jordan
about the Tamago.</i>

24:04.151 --> 24:06.027
<i>She is so happy.</i>

24:06.987 --> 24:08.071
The Tamago?

24:08.071 --> 24:11.575
<i>You didn't have to sell,
but she's over the moon about it.</i>

24:12.742 --> 24:14.077
Wow, yeah.

24:14.661 --> 24:16.872
I'm really glad George reached out.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.498
It's our pleasure.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.419
<i>It is so nice to clear the air like this.</i>

24:22.419 --> 24:23.837
<i>Let's hang soon, yeah?</i>

24:23.837 --> 24:25.338
Oh, for sure. Soon.

24:25.338 --> 24:27.132
<i>- Okay. Bye.</i>
- Bye, girl.

24:37.434 --> 24:38.268
Hey.

24:39.477 --> 24:40.562
What happened?

24:40.562 --> 24:42.522
Oh, someone threw up chocolate.

24:42.939 --> 24:45.984
Apparently, some boy
down the street, Sebastian.

24:45.984 --> 24:47.027
Oh, really?

24:47.027 --> 24:47.944
Yep.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.906
Sweetie. We have a lot
of wood in the house.

24:50.906 --> 24:54.784
When Daddy feels like throwing up,
Daddy throws up on the wood. Okay?

24:54.784 --> 24:55.785
Not the rugs.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.788
Sebastian can throw up right on the wood.

24:59.372 --> 25:01.666
Okay. I'll tell him that.

25:03.752 --> 25:07.047
Hey, Junie, I found a lot
of wrappers in the guest room.

25:07.047 --> 25:09.966
Did you eat too many Hershey's Kisses?

25:09.966 --> 25:12.510
It was probably Sebastian.

25:13.428 --> 25:14.262
Okay, well--

25:17.015 --> 25:17.849
George.

25:21.978 --> 25:22.854
Okay.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.400
Maybe we should go down to Sebastian's

25:27.400 --> 25:29.277
and ask him if he ate the chocolate.

25:29.986 --> 25:30.862
Junie.

25:31.446 --> 25:35.492
Hey, it's okay to make a mistake,
but it's not okay to lie.

25:36.618 --> 25:40.914
I ate some, but don't be mad.

25:40.914 --> 25:42.707
Please stay together.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.088
Hey! Are you worried
because of what Fumi said?

25:49.714 --> 25:53.134
I want everyone to be happy all the time.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.970
Oh, sweetie.

25:54.970 --> 25:58.682
You can't be happy all the time,
and that's okay.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.559
Yeah. Honey, even if we're not happy,

26:01.559 --> 26:04.980
we still love each other
because we're a family.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.690
And family is forever.

26:06.690 --> 26:08.108
It is?

26:08.108 --> 26:10.819
Yeah, and I'll always love Mommy.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.863
- Mommy's name is Amy.
- Mm-hm.

26:14.447 --> 26:19.619
And Amy has taken care of me,
just like she's taking care of you,

26:19.619 --> 26:24.332
all these years,
and that builds year-by-year,

26:24.332 --> 26:26.167
and that makes us so strong.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.085
Yeah.

26:27.085 --> 26:29.587
And Dada gives everything he can to us.

26:30.088 --> 26:31.965
He always puts us first.

26:33.675 --> 26:35.385
He sacrifices so much.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.388
George.

26:38.972 --> 26:41.016
George.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.258
What the fuck?

28:06.768 --> 28:07.977
Can you see me?

28:07.977 --> 28:08.895
<i>What?</i>

28:08.895 --> 28:10.438
<i>Are you by my house?</i>

28:11.064 --> 28:12.273
Are you by my house?

28:12.273 --> 28:14.359
<i>Oh, my God, I hate talking to you.</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:18.238
<i>Look, I called to let you know
that I don't need your help, okay?</i>

28:18.238 --> 28:19.239
<i>The deal's off.</i>

28:19.239 --> 28:20.949
What? No, a deal's a deal.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.034
<i>Look, someone took the fall for me</i>

28:23.034 --> 28:25.203
<i>and I appreciate
that you were willing to--</i>

28:25.203 --> 28:27.747
- No.
<i>- Actually, it was just good money for you.</i>

28:27.747 --> 28:29.624
- No.
<i>- So you can't be pissed.</i>

28:29.624 --> 28:31.584
I can be whatever the fuck I want to be.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.169
<i>As a good faith action,</i>

28:33.169 --> 28:37.382
<i>I'm letting you know that my neighbors
are actively searching for you,</i>

28:37.382 --> 28:40.009
<i>and they just won't stop
until they have the bad guy.</i>

28:40.009 --> 28:43.012
What the fuck? You are the bad guy!

28:43.012 --> 28:44.973
<i>Maybe, like, paint your truck?</i>

28:44.973 --> 28:46.141
I already did!

28:46.141 --> 28:47.267
Because of you!

28:47.267 --> 28:48.560
<i>Okay, I gotta go.</i>

28:48.560 --> 28:49.519
- Amy!

28:50.854 --> 28:51.730
Fuck!

29:03.700 --> 29:05.994
<i>You've reached
the anonymous neighborhood tip line.</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:07.454
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

29:12.167 --> 29:14.461
I'm sorry he sold the Tamago
without telling you.

29:14.461 --> 29:16.921
It's fine. I've been meaning to sell it.

29:16.921 --> 29:19.174
Yeah, he really didn't need to.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.469
Let him think he saved the day, okay?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.429
He needs it.

29:24.429 --> 29:25.388
Okay.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.640
You're looking much better.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.435
My body heals quickly.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.857
Are you sure you're done?
We can keep shopping.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.734
Anything you want? It's on me.

29:37.734 --> 29:41.738
You've always been so generous,
and I'm sure you'll continue to be.

29:43.281 --> 29:46.326
Fumi, I wanted to address
the elephant in the room.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.869
- Elephant?
- Yeah.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.412
I don't see an elephant.

29:50.538 --> 29:55.502
I see shapes and swirls and patterns.

29:59.130 --> 30:02.008
Haru and I loved each other deeply.

30:02.884 --> 30:05.303
We wanted the same things out of life.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.598
We achieved so much together.

30:09.933 --> 30:12.268
But financial stability
was not one of them.

30:13.311 --> 30:15.480
There was a time
when we worried over money,

30:16.189 --> 30:18.316
but he taught me something very important.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.110
The moment you begin to worry,

30:21.945 --> 30:24.322
the moment you acknowledge the worry,

30:25.073 --> 30:27.158
you solidify it into existence,

30:27.909 --> 30:29.828
which is why we chose to ignore,

30:30.370 --> 30:32.080
and ignore we did.

30:34.415 --> 30:36.125
I'm not sure I follow.

30:37.335 --> 30:38.586
Well, look at me now.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.630
Buying everything I want.

30:41.256 --> 30:43.424
Amy, all you have is perception.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.885
There is no objective truth.

30:45.885 --> 30:48.429
You create the truth you want to inhabit.

30:50.640 --> 30:52.851
So, what do you want for your family?

30:54.185 --> 30:56.187
What do you want for yourself?

31:07.782 --> 31:09.284
Where the fuck is Isaac?

31:16.541 --> 31:17.584
You fucking snake.

31:17.584 --> 31:18.501
What?

31:18.501 --> 31:19.586
What's going on?

31:19.586 --> 31:20.879
I'm in fucking jail!

31:20.879 --> 31:22.338
Looking at five to ten.

31:22.755 --> 31:25.049
I don't understand. What happened?

31:25.049 --> 31:26.968
What happened? You sold me out.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.970
I don't know what you're talking about.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.722
I just got the call and I came here.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.765
Like, I'm completely in the dark.

31:32.765 --> 31:36.060

31:52.577 --> 31:55.038
My lawyer had me in the clear.
She had it all planned out.

31:55.038 --> 31:57.540
Did your lawyer fuck up?
Do you need me to get you a new one?

31:57.540 --> 32:00.585
It's your fucking road rage shit!
The fucking cops think I did it.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.545
My parole's fucked!

32:02.545 --> 32:03.671
Fucked!

32:03.671 --> 32:06.132
Who else would've
sold me out besides you? Who else?

32:06.132 --> 32:11.095
Hey, first of all, that-- Come on,
I would never even think to do that.

32:11.095 --> 32:14.891
That's some diabolical mastermind shit.
I can't even think that far out.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.228
Oh, wait, dude.

32:19.228 --> 32:20.688
For the Lord.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.691

- That's all right!

32:27.779 --> 32:28.613
Focus!

32:29.280 --> 32:30.573
Get the ball!

32:30.573 --> 32:33.826
I bet Amy saw the license plate
on the truck.

32:34.410 --> 32:35.912
And it's under your name.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.206
Fuck.

32:39.457 --> 32:41.209
You didn't tell them it was me, right?

32:41.209 --> 32:44.087
I did. I told them right away.
The cops didn't believe me.

32:44.087 --> 32:46.172
Oh, man. 'Cause your record?

32:46.172 --> 32:48.883
Just say you were driving, man.
Just say you were driving.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.469
The Filipinos turned on me.
I gotta get out of here!

32:53.638 --> 32:54.722
