LEVIATHAN

06:26.193 --> 06:28.926
I'll have a smoke outside,
or I'll fall asleep.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.559
OK. I'll be quick.

06:47.322 --> 06:48.822
There they are...

07:05.452 --> 07:07.384
Not making your quota, Sergeant?

07:07.484 --> 07:08.984
Your license and registration.

07:09.117 --> 07:11.883
Polished your badge today?

07:15.350 --> 07:19.082
Stepanych will come see you today.
His carburettor broke again.

07:19.182 --> 07:22.148
Again? I'm not a charity.

07:22.281 --> 07:23.914
You know he'll make it up to you.

07:24.014 --> 07:26.414
I can buy my own damn vodka.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.280
Look,

07:29.013 --> 07:32.279
he said he'll cover everything
for our trip: petrol,

07:32.379 --> 07:33.512
food, guns.

07:33.646 --> 07:35.645
I'm so excited,
I could wet my pants!

07:35.778 --> 07:37.578
- Kolya...
- Pasha.

07:37.678 --> 07:40.111
- It'll only take a second.
- I'm serious.

07:40.611 --> 07:42.444
I can't today.

07:42.544 --> 07:44.443
Tell him to come tomorrow.

07:46.009 --> 07:48.242
- I will.
- All right.

07:48.375 --> 07:49.742
Say hi to the wife.

07:59.007 --> 08:01.772
I'm sick of that Stepanych
and his truck.

08:01.906 --> 08:03.172
Fucking cop...

08:05.105 --> 08:08.704
Cheap bastard is always after me
to fix his rust bucket.

08:09.204 --> 08:12.704
He can crawl around
underneath it himself.

08:13.537 --> 08:17.369
Any corrupt traffic cop can afford
a good car after 5 years on the job.

08:17.503 --> 08:19.102
Maybe he's an honest cop.

08:19.236 --> 08:21.368
Yeah, and generous!

08:35.565 --> 08:37.432
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

08:50.662 --> 08:52.629
And where's your "good morning"?

08:53.295 --> 08:54.794
I don't know.

08:56.394 --> 08:58.060
Look for it, then.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.027
Where?

09:04.026 --> 09:07.192
Did you wash?
Go on, don't be an ape.

09:08.492 --> 09:10.191
You're the ape.

09:10.291 --> 09:11.457
What?

09:12.357 --> 09:13.424
Nothing.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.589
- Stop right there.
- Get lost.

09:19.689 --> 09:22.355
- What did you say?
- Just what you heard.

09:24.388 --> 09:25.688
Oh! They're here.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.283
Dima, tell them to take me along.

09:49.249 --> 09:52.916
What about school?
You have a test coming up. Go get ready.

09:53.048 --> 09:54.082
Don't lie...

09:54.182 --> 09:57.247
- Don't talk to your mum like that!
- She's not my mum!

10:10.178 --> 10:11.978
Difficult age...

10:12.778 --> 10:14.111
You shouldn't hit him.

10:14.244 --> 10:16.377
Just an affectionate slap.

10:16.477 --> 10:18.743
I'm not driving him to school today.

10:18.876 --> 10:21.709
He's been rude to me all morning.

10:22.775 --> 10:25.241
I can't either. My friend's here.

10:25.741 --> 10:29.608
He's your son. Up to you
whether he becomes a man or an ape.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.940
Does he really have a test today?

10:33.807 --> 10:34.939
Yes.

10:36.239 --> 10:39.372
Kolya, just take him.
I can come along too.

10:40.672 --> 10:42.738
He'd like that.

10:50.669 --> 10:53.735
Hey, soldier of fortune,
you ready to go?

10:59.634 --> 11:01.134
How've you been?

11:01.234 --> 11:02.467
All right.

11:07.099 --> 11:09.032
We're looking for a new place.

11:10.565 --> 11:13.031
I've been saying
we should move out of town.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.630
Away from this place.
He says nothing.

11:16.764 --> 11:19.697
- Could you talk to him?
- Sure.

11:19.797 --> 11:21.263
Can't I just wear it?

11:21.396 --> 11:23.429
Give it back, Dad.

11:23.562 --> 11:25.962
All right, I'll give it back.
Stop whining.

11:26.095 --> 11:27.095
Thank you.

11:30.761 --> 11:32.260
Go start the car.

11:32.360 --> 11:33.760
You're driving.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.026
Alone?

11:35.593 --> 11:37.959
You wish.

11:38.093 --> 11:40.392
Dima and I are coming too.

11:42.158 --> 11:44.591
- But I'm driving, right?
- Yes, you.

11:49.157 --> 11:50.556
Time out!

11:57.255 --> 11:59.255
My own fault for coaching him.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.187
A couple more years,
and he'll knock you out cold.

12:05.120 --> 12:06.587
It's all good.

12:12.285 --> 12:14.451
- I love you.
- I know.

12:19.750 --> 12:21.683
Don't let him drive too fast!

12:45.778 --> 12:46.778
Hello.

12:46.878 --> 12:49.744
Hi. Kolya's taking Roma to school.

12:49.844 --> 12:51.243
Come in. He'll be back soon.

12:51.343 --> 12:56.576
That's OK, I'll wait out here
and have a smoke.

13:50.331 --> 13:51.730
Hello, Kolya.

13:51.864 --> 13:53.896
Hey there. Car troubles again?

13:55.063 --> 13:57.695
Didn't Pasha tell you
that I can't today?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.262
No. Why, what's up?

13:59.395 --> 14:02.062
My friend is visiting from Moscow.

14:02.194 --> 14:03.894
My court hearing is at noon,

14:03.994 --> 14:07.261
and we still have
a few things to go over.

14:10.926 --> 14:12.526
I'll do it tomorrow.

14:12.626 --> 14:13.959
Come by in the morning.

14:14.092 --> 14:15.259
Tomorrow?

14:16.359 --> 14:18.191
- I'm Ivan Stepanych.
- Dima.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.890
I promise. I'll fix her up -
good as new.

14:22.157 --> 14:24.290
OK, Kolya, fair enough.

14:24.390 --> 14:26.189
Tomorrow it is then.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.422
He wasn't happy about that.

14:33.721 --> 14:35.954
- Funny character.
- You think?

14:36.554 --> 14:39.220
He's outlived two wives.

14:39.354 --> 14:40.686
Fucking tyrant.

14:43.619 --> 14:45.619
OK, my friends.

14:47.618 --> 14:50.118
Over the last two months,
I dug up some dirt

14:50.751 --> 14:52.251
on that bastard.

14:52.384 --> 14:53.817
Got him by the balls?

14:53.917 --> 14:55.883
Yep, it'll do some damage.

14:55.983 --> 14:59.849
- Doesn't look like much.
- So what now, how does it help?

14:59.949 --> 15:01.282
Here's the deal:

15:01.982 --> 15:04.381
I think today's ruling
won't be in our favor...

15:04.481 --> 15:07.380
- Don't write us off yet.
- But...

15:07.847 --> 15:11.679
We need him to think
what's best for him:

15:11.813 --> 15:13.613
settle with us, or we go public.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.746
- Meaning?
- Kolya, let him finish.

15:15.879 --> 15:19.711
I want to know what he found.
A cannon can't bring that prick down!

15:19.811 --> 15:21.811
No need for cannons.

15:21.944 --> 15:24.277
We'll just gently tug him

15:24.377 --> 15:25.576
by the balls.

15:25.710 --> 15:28.976
I don't believe in that approach.
We've got to crush him.

15:30.609 --> 15:32.409
- With a sledgehammer!
- No.

15:32.542 --> 15:34.842
Only a subtle approach
works with his kind.

15:34.942 --> 15:37.141
This here is our leverage. Facts.

15:37.241 --> 15:39.707
- Let me see.
- Not just yet.

15:39.841 --> 15:41.373
After the hearing.

15:42.806 --> 15:44.172
- Why's that?
- Kolya...

15:44.306 --> 15:46.972
Because you're a hothead.
No offense,

15:47.072 --> 15:49.838
but you can fly off the handle
just like that.

15:49.938 --> 15:52.738
And the last thing we need now
is a scandal.

15:53.470 --> 15:55.570
Come on. I'm not crazy.

15:55.670 --> 15:59.836
I have to know. You think
I'll just blurt out everything in court?

15:59.936 --> 16:02.702
- Do you trust me, bro?
- Of course.

16:02.836 --> 16:05.368
Then don't question me -
read it after.

16:06.867 --> 16:10.100
Lilya, how about some tea?

16:17.065 --> 16:20.198
Well, all right. I'll read it after.

16:20.798 --> 16:22.031
Good man.

16:22.698 --> 16:26.263
But you know,
you're bossing me around, junior.

16:26.397 --> 16:28.097
And I don't like it.

16:28.630 --> 16:32.162
Kolya, "junior" is what I was
in the army 20 years ago.

16:32.262 --> 16:33.395
Why are you

16:33.529 --> 16:36.661
waving these papers in my face then?

16:36.761 --> 16:40.060
See for yourself then, chief.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.227
Well, I've heard things about him.
Who hasn't, around here?

16:44.959 --> 16:47.226
He's got blood dripping...

16:48.692 --> 16:50.792
from his hands.

16:50.892 --> 16:53.691
So why isn't he in prison
if you've got all this documented?

16:53.825 --> 16:56.457
Because somebody up top needs him.

16:56.590 --> 16:58.756
They've got all of them by the balls.

16:58.856 --> 17:01.723
Easier to manage that way.
It's all very simple.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.321
Vadim's position is safe

17:05.422 --> 17:07.288
as long as he serves his purpose.

17:07.387 --> 17:08.521
Or until he dies.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.820
Or until someone lynches him.

17:10.921 --> 17:13.553
Give me a break.
Who's going to lynch him?

17:13.686 --> 17:15.486
You guys coming or what?

17:16.053 --> 17:18.286
So let him sleep. Come alone.

17:21.385 --> 17:22.851
I see.

17:24.384 --> 17:26.584
If there's no one
to watch him, fine.

17:28.150 --> 17:30.849
I know.
I've just got other things on my mind.

17:32.016 --> 17:33.382
I'll talk to you later.

17:33.516 --> 17:35.416
So what? Not coming?

17:35.516 --> 17:39.215
Pasha is asleep after his shift.
There's no one to watch the kid.

17:39.348 --> 17:42.247
Last time they had an excuse too.
Some friends!

17:42.347 --> 17:44.614
- What about yours?
- Mine are right here.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.346
OK, Kolya, you win.

17:49.313 --> 17:51.079
My friends are shit.

17:51.212 --> 17:52.978
- Sure are!
- Stop it, please.

17:53.578 --> 17:56.044
Kolya, get a grip.
Watch your driving.

17:56.177 --> 17:57.811
My driving!

17:57.943 --> 17:59.143
Lilya...

17:59.910 --> 18:01.176
I'm not saying anything.

18:23.505 --> 18:28.104
Decree No. 1295 of the Pribrezhny
Town Administration

18:28.204 --> 18:33.736
ordered the seizure from Mr. Sergeyev
of a land parcel of 0.66 acres

18:33.869 --> 18:36.935
cadastral number 28:136:254:2001,

18:37.035 --> 18:39.002
along with the residential building,

18:39.135 --> 18:41.934
automotive works shed,
repair garage and greenhouse.

18:42.068 --> 18:46.400
Mr. Sergeyev petitioned the Zagorye
District Court to repeal this Decree.

18:46.533 --> 18:49.500
The Court ruled to deny the petition.

18:49.632 --> 18:54.765
Mr. Sergeyev then petitioned
Pribrezhny Town Court to appeal.

18:54.898 --> 18:58.564
During proceedings, Mr. Sergeyev
insisted the court ruling be revoked.

18:58.698 --> 19:01.697
The Town Administration
rejected the appeal

19:01.830 --> 19:04.863
and upheld the ruling
of the Zagorye District Court.

19:04.996 --> 19:08.028
Mr. Sergeyev states the initial ruling
violated procedural regulations

19:08.162 --> 19:12.595
and therefore disputes the conclusion
that the seizure of the land parcel

19:12.761 --> 19:14.527
is lawful.

19:14.661 --> 19:20.126
He says the Administration did not
meet the deadline for notifying him

19:20.226 --> 19:23.992
and violated the procedure
for determining the purchase price.

19:24.092 --> 19:26.724
He also contends
that, when determining the price,

19:26.858 --> 19:31.590
the court did not consider
an independent evaluation he submitted,

19:31.690 --> 19:33.990
which values the property higher
than determined by the Administration.

19:34.123 --> 19:36.322
Me also states
that the Administration

19:36.456 --> 19:39.355
violated civil law.

19:39.489 --> 19:45.254
Mr. Sergeyev was not notified
of the upcoming seizure a year in advance

19:45.354 --> 19:48.087
due to which he incurred expenses
related to improving his property.

19:48.253 --> 19:52.119
Also, the purchase price did not consider
his loss of business revenue

19:52.219 --> 19:57.585
as well as his liabilities
to third parties.

19:57.685 --> 20:00.784
The Court ruled: by Decree No. 1295
pf Pribrezhny Town Administration,

20:00.917 --> 20:06.649
the land parcel shall be seized
to build a town communications center.

20:06.749 --> 20:11.015
The Decree determines the purchase
price of the land and structures

20:11.148 --> 20:13.781
as 639,540.27 roubles.

20:13.881 --> 20:16.481
The purchase price was determined
based on an evaluation.

20:16.581 --> 20:20.780
Per Mr. Sergeyev's request,
Alliance Ltd estimated the value

20:20.880 --> 20:23.746
of liabilities
for the loss of agricultural production

20:23.846 --> 20:28.678
due to the seizure of the land parcel
of 0.66 acres for the town's needs.

20:28.811 --> 20:33.410
The market value of the liabilities
constitutes 3.5 million roubles.

20:33.577 --> 20:34.610
The court questions...

20:47.674 --> 20:49.706
...and deems it invalid.

20:49.806 --> 20:53.439
The Court upholds the purchase price
of 639,540.27 roubles

20:53.539 --> 20:56.772
as determined
by the Town Administration's evaluation.

20:56.905 --> 21:01.804
The Court rejects the statement that
the purchase procedure was violated.

21:01.904 --> 21:04.870
The case file contains letters

21:05.003 --> 21:09.702
about the purchase and testimony
of Town Administration officials

21:09.836 --> 21:11.969
stating that Mr. Sergeyev

21:12.401 --> 21:15.868
had been notified
of the seizure of the land parcel.

21:16.001 --> 21:19.100
The Court casts doubt
on Mr. Sergeyev's claims

21:19.200 --> 21:20.967
that he didn't receive
these notifications.

21:21.100 --> 21:27.598
Having examined Mr. Sergeyev's appeal,
Pribrezhny Town Court has concluded

21:27.698 --> 21:32.131
that Mr. Sergeyev failed to establish
grounds to repeal the court ruling

21:32.264 --> 21:36.030
pursuant to article 330
of the Civil Procedural Code.

21:36.164 --> 21:42.129
As per articles 320-335 of the Civil
Procedural Code, the court denies

21:42.262 --> 21:46.661
Mr. Sergeyev's petition to revoke
the ruling of the Zagorye District Court.

21:46.794 --> 21:51.327
That ruling is upheld,
and Mr. Sergeyev's appeal is denied.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.693
The ruling
shall come into effect forthwith.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.189
Well, shall we go?

22:09.156 --> 22:10.423
In a minute.

23:11.309 --> 23:13.742
Vadim, every time you come,

23:13.875 --> 23:16.175
all you do
is worry about the election.

23:16.308 --> 23:18.308
It's not for another year.

23:18.874 --> 23:21.074
In fair weather, prepare for foul.

23:22.807 --> 23:26.006
You do well to tend

23:26.106 --> 23:27.839
to worldly matters,

23:28.472 --> 23:30.339
but remember the divine.

23:30.439 --> 23:31.771
But I...

23:33.305 --> 23:34.304
Don't I already?

23:34.438 --> 23:35.870
I know.

23:37.437 --> 23:39.270
You're a most...

23:40.303 --> 23:41.769
charitable patron.

23:42.436 --> 23:46.202
Even today, you come from afar,
bearing gifts.

23:48.535 --> 23:50.267
Have some fish.

23:52.334 --> 23:53.534
Right.

23:56.033 --> 23:57.933
I'm telling you,

23:59.133 --> 24:01.132
don't worry so much.

24:01.265 --> 24:03.598
All power comes from God.

24:03.732 --> 24:06.064
As long as God wishes for it,
you need not worry.

24:07.297 --> 24:09.197
And does He?

24:11.630 --> 24:15.595
Who can I ask if not you?
You're the priest!

24:16.762 --> 24:18.861
He does.

24:22.428 --> 24:24.494
Chase it with some food.

24:41.456 --> 24:42.723
Hello.

24:44.089 --> 24:46.689
Yes. Thank God, finally.

24:47.455 --> 24:52.288
Get Tyagunov's guys on it.

24:54.253 --> 24:56.087
Why wait?

24:56.520 --> 24:59.952
Tear down that bastard's
fucking place already!

25:00.719 --> 25:03.651
We've lost so much time
because of him.

25:05.751 --> 25:09.050
How's that your fault?
Drop the excuses!

25:11.450 --> 25:13.217
OK, later.

25:13.783 --> 25:16.116
Lyosha, get my thing...

25:18.182 --> 25:19.915
from the glove compartment.

25:40.943 --> 25:43.077
Hey, Vasya.

25:43.543 --> 25:47.042
Let's pay that fucking arsehole...

25:47.742 --> 25:49.442
a visit real quick.

25:50.075 --> 25:51.908
The one at the bottom of the hill.

25:52.041 --> 25:54.174
- Past the bridge?
- Yes.

25:54.274 --> 25:57.040
There are lots of arseholes
at the bottom of hills.

25:57.873 --> 25:59.139
What?

26:00.273 --> 26:03.506
You trying to be smart now?

26:04.472 --> 26:07.905
It's obvious that the prick
wants this place

26:08.038 --> 26:10.304
so he can build himself a palace!

26:10.437 --> 26:12.137
Calm down. That's enough.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.870
I built this place with my own hands!

26:22.568 --> 26:24.234
Here we go again.

26:25.701 --> 26:26.767
Kolya...

26:44.897 --> 26:46.029
Here.

26:50.562 --> 26:52.595
My whole life is here.

26:54.161 --> 26:56.894
My grandfather lived here.
And my father...

26:57.394 --> 26:58.594
He's seen it before.

26:58.727 --> 27:00.526
Stay out of this!

27:00.626 --> 27:01.793
Stop yelling!

27:01.893 --> 27:03.493
Kolya, calm down.

27:18.656 --> 27:20.089
Come on, Dima.

27:21.455 --> 27:22.821
Let's have a drink.

27:34.919 --> 27:36.186
Here's to you.

27:36.952 --> 27:37.918
All right.

27:46.783 --> 27:50.083
- To everything you've done for us.
- If you say so, bro.

27:52.449 --> 27:53.782
Thank you.

27:55.948 --> 27:57.448
Thank you.

27:57.581 --> 28:00.647
What are you talking about?
It'll be fine.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.313
But that dirt of yours...

28:02.480 --> 28:05.646
Kolya, that's not my fucking dirt.
It's his.

28:08.245 --> 28:09.778
All I'm saying is,

28:09.911 --> 28:12.044
I don't see a way

28:13.344 --> 28:16.243
to put your theory to work.

28:18.976 --> 28:21.509
Either way,
they're knocking this place down.

28:23.208 --> 28:29.574
We'll buy that crappy apartment
near Angela's

28:29.707 --> 28:32.274
with that 639,000 roubles
and 27 kopecks

28:34.106 --> 28:36.239
and I'll become a cop, like Pasha.

28:37.073 --> 28:37.472
Oh no...

28:39.838 --> 28:41.238
Listen, bro,

28:42.104 --> 28:45.371
this is not like you.

28:46.337 --> 28:47.870
You hear me?

28:50.203 --> 28:53.635
You've never let problems
get to you before.

28:53.769 --> 28:56.068
What's the matter with you?

28:57.934 --> 29:02.967
Things were different.
We're not 20 anymore.

29:03.467 --> 29:05.566
The years take their toll.

29:05.699 --> 29:07.466
Anyway, what are you on about?

29:09.332 --> 29:11.098
Are you a shrink now?

29:11.232 --> 29:14.331
I'm no fucking shrink.

29:14.431 --> 29:16.630
But fuck, man, it's like...

29:17.064 --> 29:21.363
You can look
at this situation differently.

29:21.496 --> 29:22.695
How is that?

29:22.829 --> 29:24.995
Fucking hell...

29:25.095 --> 29:26.395
You're my brother!

29:26.528 --> 29:29.694
Take on the challenge,
for fuck's sake!

29:29.794 --> 29:31.794
It's a fresh start!

29:32.960 --> 29:36.426
Easy for you to say.
You're off to Moscow tomorrow...

29:36.560 --> 29:41.025
What's Moscow got to do with it?
Come with me then. You hear me?

29:41.159 --> 29:42.525
Why not?

29:42.658 --> 29:44.224
- To Moscow?
- Sure.

29:44.291 --> 29:46.624
Pack your bags.

29:47.857 --> 29:51.389
Rent a studio apartment
for starters, for about 30,000.

29:51.889 --> 29:52.956
Oh, wow!

29:53.056 --> 29:54.856
What? That's a fair price.

29:55.588 --> 29:59.955
A fucking genius handyman like you
won't have any problems finding work!

30:00.055 --> 30:02.820
With your hands, you'll be all right.

30:02.954 --> 30:05.586
We'll find something for Lilya, too.

30:05.720 --> 30:09.153
Maybe in some shop at first.

30:09.753 --> 30:13.752
Anything is better than cleaning fish
at that stinking fish farm.

30:14.418 --> 30:16.917
What's the matter with you, bro?

30:22.782 --> 30:24.316
What about Roma?

30:24.416 --> 30:27.082
What about him? He'll go to school.

30:27.182 --> 30:29.181
He's a kid. He goes to school!

30:29.281 --> 30:31.014
Sort of...

30:32.114 --> 30:34.647
He's barely a C-student.
Who will take him?

30:34.747 --> 30:37.979
They're required to.
They'll take him.

30:38.579 --> 30:39.646
Kolya!

30:39.746 --> 30:42.645
I'm not a C-student. I get Bs.

30:42.778 --> 30:44.078
Don't get worked up.

30:44.178 --> 30:46.645
What are you doing listening to us?

30:46.745 --> 30:49.510
Why would I do that?
I just went to the toilet.

30:49.644 --> 30:51.044
Come over here then!

30:52.043 --> 30:53.676
Come on.

31:02.807 --> 31:04.907
What's up guys? You need help?

31:05.573 --> 31:07.873
Kolya, don't you recognize authority

31:08.706 --> 31:10.772
when you see it?

31:12.639 --> 31:14.738
And what do you want, "Authority"?

31:15.671 --> 31:17.338
Just all of this.

31:19.304 --> 31:20.704
Come and get it.

31:21.203 --> 31:23.037
Will it all fit

31:23.169 --> 31:24.936
into your hearse?

31:26.269 --> 31:27.702
What else?

31:29.702 --> 31:33.035
You're all insects.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.766
You always have to make things
difficult, don't you?

31:38.200 --> 31:41.765
That's way you're all drowning in shit.

31:41.899 --> 31:43.932
Kolya,

31:44.032 --> 31:46.964
have you packed your suitcases?

31:47.098 --> 31:50.997
Look, sir, it's you
who's not supposed to be here now.

31:51.131 --> 31:54.096
The court ruling
hasn't taken effect yet.

31:55.196 --> 31:58.995
And your office doesn't entitle you
to come here. Do you have a warrant?

31:59.829 --> 32:01.328
Who are you?

32:01.428 --> 32:02.761
Dmitri Seleznev,

32:03.361 --> 32:06.494
Moscow Bar Association.

32:06.627 --> 32:09.593
Kolya's lawyer in litigation
with your gang.

32:10.993 --> 32:15.892
Oh, yeah, I heard someone
babbling about that.

32:16.025 --> 32:20.624
So what's up, Kolya?
Can't stand up for yourself anymore?

32:20.724 --> 32:22.990
Ignore him, man.
Take it easy, Kolya.

32:25.256 --> 32:27.156
I'll stand up to you, bitch.

32:28.289 --> 32:31.888
Please, no more, I just shit myself.

32:32.022 --> 32:33.954
Scary stuff.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.287
- Sir...
- OK.

32:38.453 --> 32:41.820
Maybe I just wanted to have
a friendly drink with you.

32:43.186 --> 32:45.585
By the way, where is it?
Give it here.

32:46.585 --> 32:47.885
Want some?

32:48.651 --> 32:49.684
No?

32:50.318 --> 32:51.418
Guess not.

32:52.050 --> 32:55.517
I'm not gonna offer him any.
I don't like his kind.

32:56.749 --> 33:00.982
Anyway, I wanted to tell you
something to bear in mind.

33:01.115 --> 33:03.081
Lilya, call the police.

33:03.181 --> 33:06.281
Go ahead, Lilya, call them!

33:06.381 --> 33:08.580
The police. Do it.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.980
What's your name, kid?

33:12.113 --> 33:15.312
Listen, Vadim,
why are you doing this?

33:15.445 --> 33:17.845
You're not so drunk
that you don't know...

33:17.978 --> 33:21.311
Shut your mouth, you courtroom rat.

33:21.444 --> 33:24.243
And you, listen up.

33:24.343 --> 33:26.610
- Fuck off.
- Remember my face!

33:26.743 --> 33:28.242
Ignore him, bro.

33:28.342 --> 33:30.109
You piece of shit.

33:30.975 --> 33:35.075
You've never had any fucking rights

33:35.741 --> 33:38.440
and never will!

33:39.440 --> 33:40.907
Where the fuck are you going?

33:41.407 --> 33:44.939
Listen, it would be best
if you go now.

33:45.572 --> 33:49.705
You are trespassing.

33:49.838 --> 33:52.437
And the owners are not happy
to see you.

33:52.604 --> 33:55.237
Vadim, let's not escalate the situation.

33:55.337 --> 33:57.036
What did you just say?

33:57.970 --> 33:59.736
I'm the owner.

34:00.335 --> 34:03.335
- Got it?
- Got it. I've got it.

34:03.468 --> 34:05.901
Let's talk about that tomorrow.

34:06.434 --> 34:07.634
Tomorrow.

34:07.734 --> 34:10.167
We have some business to discuss.

34:10.301 --> 34:13.400
Ivan has told me a lot about you.

34:17.665 --> 34:20.931
Ivan who?

34:21.065 --> 34:22.731
Ivan Kostrov.

34:23.730 --> 34:26.063
From the Committee. Kostrov.

34:27.663 --> 34:31.262
Just because we can't see them,
doesn't mean they're not there.

34:33.527 --> 34:37.027
Anyway, I'm tired of you all...

34:37.960 --> 34:39.726
So what about tomorrow?

34:40.726 --> 34:41.893
Tomorrow.

34:44.426 --> 34:47.059
Between 3 and 5pm.

34:48.391 --> 34:51.324
Office hours for constituent issues.

34:53.424 --> 34:55.257
I'm all right. I'm all right.

35:11.487 --> 35:13.987
Kolya, are you going out hunting
or something?

35:15.986 --> 35:17.552
Give me that.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.585
Bro,

35:20.685 --> 35:25.784
tomorrow we'll write a statement
about his abuse of office.

35:25.884 --> 35:27.984
We'll tear him to bits, Kolya!

35:28.084 --> 35:29.216
Dima...

35:31.449 --> 35:33.449
I won't go to Moscow.

35:34.449 --> 35:36.115
I'm staying here.

35:38.714 --> 35:40.048
Let's drink.

35:46.146 --> 35:50.012
"The actions of Vadim Shelevyat
caused great harm to my family.

35:50.645 --> 35:54.411
"He was not authorized to implement
a ruling yet to come into effect

35:54.511 --> 35:57.577
"and he committed a criminal act

35:57.677 --> 36:00.243
"as defined by Article 330
of the Criminal Code.

36:00.977 --> 36:04.742
"Pursuant to Articles 285 and 330

36:04.876 --> 36:07.108
"and Article 141

"I request an inquiry

36:09.875 --> 36:13.940
"and, pending evidence,

36:15.306 --> 36:17.040
Take that, arsehole.

36:36.935 --> 36:38.568
Here's another one, Kolya.

36:38.701 --> 36:39.935
What?

36:40.035 --> 36:41.234
Look.

36:41.768 --> 36:46.200
"Darwin's term for directional
and irreversible historical

36:46.300 --> 36:48.733
"development of life."

36:50.299 --> 36:51.566
9 letters.

36:52.665 --> 36:55.831
A prolonged leap
from the twat to the grave.

36:56.265 --> 36:59.197
What's with the swearing,
Sergeant Potty Mouth?

37:01.430 --> 37:04.296
- Takes one to know one.
- Sure does.

37:05.563 --> 37:08.062
"E-vo-lu-tion."

37:08.695 --> 37:09.928
It fits.

37:13.294 --> 37:14.361
Good morning.

37:16.393 --> 37:18.160
Are you almost done?

37:18.293 --> 37:19.560
Yeah, yeah.

37:20.192 --> 37:21.826
Another half hour or so.

37:22.925 --> 37:25.825
I've written it.
Just sign it, and we'll be off.

37:26.958 --> 37:28.558
Dima!

37:30.390 --> 37:34.156
I'm not sure if Kolya told you,
but I just had a birthday.

37:34.256 --> 37:35.289
Happy birthday.

37:35.423 --> 37:39.222
So I invite you to join us tomorrow.

37:39.322 --> 37:41.788
Campfire, kebabs, vodka,
a bit of shooting...

37:41.921 --> 37:43.554
My treat.

37:43.654 --> 37:45.554
Shooting - as in, hunting?

37:45.687 --> 37:47.320
Of course not.

37:47.986 --> 37:49.753
We're going with women and kids.

37:50.419 --> 37:53.952
We'll just do
a little target practice, for fun.

37:54.418 --> 37:55.852
Is it far?

37:55.985 --> 37:57.518
Hundred kilometers or so.

37:57.618 --> 38:00.084
We'll leave early, hit the booze,

38:00.184 --> 38:02.817
shoot a little and come back.

38:04.016 --> 38:05.882
- I'd love to.
- Excellent.

38:07.216 --> 38:08.549
Kolya, I'm ready when you are.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.914
Pardon me?

38:17.014 --> 38:18.080
Are you the victim?

38:18.580 --> 38:21.379
No, Mr. Sergeyev is the victim.
I'm his lawyer.

38:34.843 --> 38:36.076
Off he goes.

38:36.743 --> 38:38.775
Reporting to his superiors.

38:47.807 --> 38:49.906
Lilya, got any water?

38:57.738 --> 39:00.071
I have a feeling he won't accept it.

39:00.904 --> 39:03.137
- Can he do that?
- Sure.

39:03.270 --> 39:05.437
Even though he has to by law.

39:05.537 --> 39:07.269
So what then?

39:07.403 --> 39:10.436
We go to the prosecutor's office,
And then court.

39:10.568 --> 39:13.001
If necessary, we'll file a complaint
about this guy too.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.101
We'll need all the facts,
even the minor ones.

39:15.235 --> 39:17.567
Are you going to fight
the whole town?

39:18.567 --> 39:21.233
These animals are not
the whole town.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.899
Kolya, you know what I mean.

39:24.733 --> 39:26.799
Where did our lieutenant go?

39:26.932 --> 39:28.232
Just wait.

39:33.097 --> 39:35.230
Hey there, lieutenant!
Where are you?

39:35.330 --> 39:37.163
Sir, calm down!

39:37.263 --> 39:38.762
What's this racket?

39:38.896 --> 39:40.229
Everything's OK.

39:40.362 --> 39:42.829
- I'm not talking to you.
- Will it be long?

39:42.929 --> 39:44.995
What's this behavior?

39:45.095 --> 39:47.161
Why are you making trouble?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.427
Detain this one.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.493
Put him in custody!
Take him to a cell.

39:59.558 --> 40:03.324
The prosecutor is not here,
and I'm not authorized.

40:03.424 --> 40:04.857
I can't accept your statement.

40:04.957 --> 40:08.123
And there's not a soul
in the entire office besides you?

40:08.223 --> 40:10.189
No one who is authorized.

40:10.289 --> 40:12.755
Did they all get drafted?
You don't think it's strange?

40:12.889 --> 40:13.922
No.

40:14.022 --> 40:15.522
We only have two of them.

40:15.622 --> 40:19.387
The public prosecutor is off sick,
and the detective is out on a case.

40:19.487 --> 40:22.053
You can mail it in. Or go to court.

40:22.187 --> 40:24.020
OK, I get it.
Give me a refusal note in writing.

40:25.252 --> 40:28.585
I told you: I'm not authorized.

40:30.418 --> 40:32.251
Hello. I need to see the judge.

40:32.384 --> 40:33.918
No one's here.

40:34.050 --> 40:35.817
- No one at all?
- No one.

40:36.883 --> 40:38.883
No assistants or secretaries?

40:40.483 --> 40:43.382
- When will they be in?
- I've not been informed.

40:43.516 --> 40:45.548
- I see.
- Goodbye.

40:45.648 --> 40:46.815
Thanks.

41:01.344 --> 41:04.177
- Up the stairs, third floor.
- Thanks.

42:07.630 --> 42:11.229
Why aren't you answering your phone?
I called and called.

42:11.363 --> 42:13.762
Seriously?
That little devil Vitya

42:13.862 --> 42:15.796
must have been playing with it.

42:16.228 --> 42:17.628
Surrender!

42:17.762 --> 42:20.027
- Why try to kill me?
- 'Cause you're pretty!

42:20.127 --> 42:22.894
- Say hello to Lilya!
- Howdy!

42:23.027 --> 42:27.359
Men are all the same.
First, you're pretty. Next, they'll kill you.

42:27.493 --> 42:29.593
Angela, where's Pasha?

42:49.855 --> 42:51.321
I've already heard

42:51.421 --> 42:54.087
of your crusades earlier today.

42:54.220 --> 42:56.620
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

42:56.720 --> 42:59.819
- What's your name, I forget?
- Dmitry.

42:59.952 --> 43:05.685
Right. So, you're really trying
to stick it to me, aren't you?

43:05.818 --> 43:07.684
You asked for it.

43:08.151 --> 43:10.750
But that's nothing, Vadim,

43:10.850 --> 43:13.350
in comparison
to what's in this folder.

43:13.483 --> 43:15.515
Here, take a look.

43:17.415 --> 43:18.948
There's nothing
you don't already know,

43:19.048 --> 43:23.314
but it's good to refresh
your memory sometimes.

43:23.981 --> 43:26.280
This conversation is off
to a strange start.

43:26.447 --> 43:27.713
How so?

43:27.846 --> 43:30.679
I thought we were going to talk
about your friend.

43:30.779 --> 43:33.645
As in, about our litigation
or something else?

43:33.745 --> 43:34.878
Something else.

43:35.011 --> 43:37.144
You must mean his unlawful detention?

43:37.244 --> 43:40.844
Article 301
of the Russian Criminal Code.

43:42.143 --> 43:43.977
It's good you've been notified.

43:44.576 --> 43:48.476
Vadim, it would be great
if you saw to it that justice is served

43:48.608 --> 43:50.775
and those responsible
for this outrage are punished.

43:50.875 --> 43:52.275
I would be glad to help, but...

43:52.407 --> 43:56.507
But you don't see what's in it for you?
Just look in the folder.

43:56.640 --> 43:57.940
Take a look.

43:58.440 --> 44:02.173
You'll see that Kolya's release
is only the first step.

44:02.305 --> 44:03.905
Here's what I think we'll do,

44:05.238 --> 44:07.971
young man.

44:10.704 --> 44:14.903
I'll let your Kolya out,
and you'll gather your stuff

44:16.170 --> 44:18.169
and quietly go back

44:18.269 --> 44:20.401
to where you came from.

44:20.501 --> 44:23.201
- To Moscow?
- Yeah, back to Moscow.

44:23.334 --> 44:26.900
Vadim, I'm afraid
Ivan would not have that.

44:29.399 --> 44:31.699
He'd say,
"Dima, why didn't you do

44:31.833 --> 44:34.632
"everything in your power
to restore justice?"

44:38.198 --> 44:41.464
You know Ivan personally?

44:41.597 --> 44:42.597
Ivan Kostrov?

44:43.130 --> 44:44.996
We're talking about him, right?

44:45.130 --> 44:47.029
Of course I do. You bet.

44:47.729 --> 44:49.162
We're pals.

44:49.262 --> 44:50.895
He's a lawyer, I'm a lawyer.

44:51.562 --> 44:53.594
Moscow is a huge,
but close-knit city.

44:54.594 --> 44:57.461
No one is out of reach.

44:57.561 --> 45:00.560
And if I don't read this, then what?

45:00.693 --> 45:02.192
Doesn't matter.

45:02.292 --> 45:04.825
Take my word for it:
the facts in there are damning.

45:04.925 --> 45:08.558
You know what I'm talking about.
They are, after all, your handiwork.

45:08.658 --> 45:10.191
Horrible stuff.

45:10.824 --> 45:13.590
How do you sleep at night?

45:14.823 --> 45:16.023
So,

45:17.323 --> 45:18.622
let's make a deal, or else...

45:18.722 --> 45:20.122
Or else what?

45:21.488 --> 45:24.155
Oh, it's hard to even imagine
what would happen.

45:24.288 --> 45:27.487
All within the provisions of the law,
of course.

45:27.587 --> 45:31.153
Firstly, your name would be all over
the newspapers and the Internet

45:31.253 --> 45:34.319
and on TV, all over the news.

45:43.117 --> 45:45.783
You youngsters
like playing with fire.

45:45.883 --> 45:49.249
Vadim,
you're not exactly an old man either.

45:49.416 --> 45:51.549
Or is it time to retire? No?

45:51.615 --> 45:52.981
Have you thought of that?

45:54.781 --> 45:58.580
Come back with the tea later, Yulia.

46:03.313 --> 46:06.412
Right. Let's see it.

46:08.112 --> 46:11.411
Let's see what you're trying
to stick us with here.

46:11.511 --> 46:14.610
A horror movie with you in the lead.

46:14.710 --> 46:19.109
How did it go? They cuffed him
and threw him in the cage.

46:19.843 --> 46:21.542
What did he do? Nothing!

46:21.642 --> 46:25.674
Last night, the mayor barreled in,
drunk, told 'em to pack their things.

46:25.808 --> 46:27.541
They had
another court hearing yesterday.

46:27.674 --> 46:29.207
Yes, they're getting demolished.

46:29.973 --> 46:31.307
That's all.

46:31.440 --> 46:35.406
This morning, they went to the police
to drop off a statement

46:35.506 --> 46:37.239
and they took Kolya in.

46:39.805 --> 46:41.938
Lilya is sitting right here with me.

46:42.604 --> 46:45.970
Don't be dumb,
I'm not calling just for a chat.

46:46.070 --> 46:49.436
Tell Stepanych to get his arse
to the police department.

46:49.569 --> 46:51.536
We have to get Kolya out of there.

46:53.002 --> 46:54.168
Good.

46:54.635 --> 46:56.335
Yeah, you'd better go yourself.

46:57.967 --> 47:00.900
And call us right away.
We're stressing out here.

47:01.000 --> 47:05.233
And pick up when I call,
or I'll worry. OK then.

47:05.333 --> 47:06.333
What?

47:06.999 --> 47:08.099
Me too.

47:09.365 --> 47:11.564
OK, Pasha, go already. Bye.

47:13.231 --> 47:15.231
- Something like that.
- Thanks.

47:15.331 --> 47:17.530
Don't worry, they'll get him out.

47:17.663 --> 47:21.330
They got Vova out 5 times.
He was in for real stuff - fighting,

47:21.462 --> 47:23.196
theft...

47:23.329 --> 47:25.162
Mum, I'm hungry.

47:25.295 --> 47:26.895
Go play outside.
Dinner's not ready yet.

47:26.995 --> 47:29.094
- Can I?
- What?

47:29.194 --> 47:31.160
- Go outside?
- I just told you, go!

47:31.294 --> 47:34.759
But not too far. If you go
to building 9 again, I'll kill you!

47:34.859 --> 47:36.459
- OK, Mum!
- And put your hat on!

47:44.691 --> 47:45.924
Come on in.

47:55.855 --> 47:58.088
It's OK, honey. We'll pull through.

47:58.688 --> 48:02.387
We'll get all hands on deck
and do a great job.

48:03.920 --> 48:07.720
Won't be fancy, but it'll be homely.

48:07.819 --> 48:08.852
Won't it?

48:13.951 --> 48:15.751
Let's go look at the kitchen.

48:20.583 --> 48:22.549
There's even a radiator in here.

48:23.449 --> 48:24.516
You hear me?

48:30.515 --> 48:32.447
Let's say you got me. Now what?

48:32.880 --> 48:34.114
That depends on you.

48:34.247 --> 48:36.713
I got that much. What do you want?

48:39.545 --> 48:43.745
You're the second public official today
to use that tone with me.

48:43.845 --> 48:46.977
Don't beat around the bush.
Get to the point.

48:48.444 --> 48:50.943
I want Kolya to keep what's his.

48:55.442 --> 48:57.042
That's not possible.

49:00.041 --> 49:02.241
I thought there was
nothing impossible for you.

49:03.307 --> 49:05.707
Well, now you know better.

49:05.807 --> 49:08.473
You can't get 3.5 million?
I don't believe that.

49:08.606 --> 49:10.639
Oh, that's what you mean.

49:11.806 --> 49:13.272
That I can do.

49:13.372 --> 49:15.471
And, of course, release Kolya.

49:15.605 --> 49:17.005
It's a deal.

49:18.337 --> 49:20.070
Leave me your phone number.

49:20.704 --> 49:23.936
I'll call you in a couple of days.
We'll meet and discuss the details.

49:24.603 --> 49:25.635
You'll still be here?

49:25.735 --> 49:26.969
Yes, I'll be in town.

49:27.435 --> 49:29.202
Except what's there to discuss?

49:30.202 --> 49:33.667
We'll only need to meet
so you can hand me the money.

49:36.867 --> 49:40.366
Hey, are you baptized?

49:40.499 --> 49:41.499
What?

49:42.632 --> 49:44.299
Why do you ask?

49:44.799 --> 49:46.431
I'm just curious.

49:48.031 --> 49:50.297
I'm a lawyer, Vadim.
I believe in facts.

49:56.829 --> 49:57.129
OK. You got it.

49:57.129 --> 49:58.296
Goodbye.

50:02.461 --> 50:03.661
Bye.

50:36.520 --> 50:39.387
Is everything OK, Vadim?

50:40.753 --> 50:40.986
Yes.

50:41.453 --> 50:43.619
You never brought me that aspirin.

50:45.752 --> 50:48.351
Get me those three right away.

50:49.617 --> 50:50.684
Who?

50:50.817 --> 50:53.416
Tarasov, Goryunov and Tkachuk.

50:54.116 --> 50:56.383
Find them, I don't care how.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.515
And close the door.

51:01.648 --> 51:03.614
You think
he'll give us the 3 million?

51:03.748 --> 51:05.814
Not 3, but 3.5.

51:05.947 --> 51:07.247
We'll see.

51:07.781 --> 51:10.713
But he shit himself big time.
And that's a good sign.

51:12.280 --> 51:13.612
Right...

51:14.579 --> 51:17.911
What did I have here last time?

51:18.045 --> 51:19.978
Borscht, dumplings, beer.

51:20.111 --> 51:21.510
That's it.

51:21.644 --> 51:22.810
Have you decided?

51:22.877 --> 51:25.977
Yes, Tatyana.
Bring us two borschts, please,

51:26.443 --> 51:29.809
two servings of dumplings,
beer and fruit juice.

51:29.942 --> 51:31.508
Or are you having beer too?

51:31.642 --> 51:33.142
Fruit juice is fine.

51:33.275 --> 51:34.475
- Fruit juice then.
- Is that it?

51:34.608 --> 51:35.675
Yes, that's all.

51:35.775 --> 51:38.407
I have to go up to my room.

51:38.507 --> 51:40.973
Please wait 10 minutes
so the food doesn't get cold.

51:41.906 --> 51:43.773
- All right.
- Thanks.

51:46.172 --> 51:48.405
Can you wait a bit?
I'll be right back.

53:01.056 --> 53:02.122
Kolya?

53:02.256 --> 53:03.588
<i>Hello, where are you?</i>

53:03.722 --> 53:06.755
We're in the restaurant at the hotel.

53:06.855 --> 53:07.921
Well, of course.

53:08.055 --> 53:12.254
I'm behind bars - you're at a restaurant.
I should have known.

53:13.586 --> 53:15.286
Yes, they released me.

53:17.885 --> 53:22.518
Not on the phone.
Let's meet, and you'll tell me everything.

53:22.618 --> 53:24.317
Finish up.

53:24.451 --> 53:27.450
I'm headed there. See you.

54:00.743 --> 54:02.743
They've been keeping dirt on me!

54:02.876 --> 54:05.075
I've known it a long time.

54:05.209 --> 54:08.874
All I ever hear from you is
the same thing right, left and center:

54:08.974 --> 54:12.741
"Everything's fine, Vadim".

54:13.540 --> 54:15.773
"Everything's fine, perfect weather -

54:16.273 --> 54:18.172
"nothing to worry about!"

54:18.306 --> 54:20.872
But I'm fucking worried!

54:22.071 --> 54:26.138
Because I smell a rat.
Something bad is brewing!

54:26.304 --> 54:29.470
When did anything like this
ever happen? I crush some louse

54:29.603 --> 54:34.469
and he turns the tables on me!
Brings in a lawyer from Moscow!

54:34.602 --> 54:37.235
And that bastard starts
blackmailing me.

54:37.368 --> 54:39.368
And drops big names!

54:39.468 --> 54:41.234
What if he's bluffing?

54:41.334 --> 54:42.501
Bluffing?

54:42.601 --> 54:46.600
How about you stop doodling
and figure out who's paying him?

54:46.733 --> 54:48.333
You think it's that loser Kolya?

54:48.433 --> 54:50.665
You should know better, woman.

54:50.765 --> 54:55.664
Or do you think
that Moscow lawyer came here

54:55.798 --> 54:57.497
to bust his arse for free?

54:57.597 --> 54:58.897
More importantly,

54:59.031 --> 55:02.263
where did he get that information?

55:03.730 --> 55:07.062
I almost fucking lost it
when I opened that folder.

55:07.162 --> 55:09.695
So what was in that folder?

55:09.795 --> 55:12.728
You don't need to know that.

55:15.793 --> 55:20.126
So they have something on you
that we don't know about?

55:20.226 --> 55:22.558
We have an election in a year.

55:22.692 --> 55:23.892
Did you forget?

55:25.258 --> 55:27.291
If I don't get elected...

55:28.324 --> 55:29.757
Need I say more?

55:32.623 --> 55:34.856
You'll all go down.

55:35.489 --> 55:37.789
No holidays abroad, no mansions,

55:38.522 --> 55:39.555
no cash.

55:40.522 --> 55:42.888
We'll all be marching

55:42.988 --> 55:45.053
off to the monastery

55:45.153 --> 55:47.153
to a jolly tune.

55:47.253 --> 55:49.120
You're paranoid.

55:49.253 --> 55:52.186
You see enemies everywhere.
Ease up on the booze.

55:53.019 --> 55:56.418
Your head will roll first!

55:56.551 --> 56:00.050
Cut the drama.
And don't yell at me!

56:00.150 --> 56:02.183
Save that for your wife.

56:02.750 --> 56:04.816
Let's be constructive.

56:04.916 --> 56:06.182
Let's.

56:07.716 --> 56:10.215
Maybe I could lean on him a bit?

56:10.848 --> 56:13.547
Within lawful limits, of course.

56:13.681 --> 56:15.247
Absolutely not.

56:17.714 --> 56:22.045
First off, get me the story
on this Moscow lawyer.

56:23.379 --> 56:28.978
Use your own channels or work together,
but find out who he is

56:29.677 --> 56:32.177
and who he's working for.

56:32.943 --> 56:36.042
He was rubbing it in
about Kostrov,

56:36.176 --> 56:37.909
and you say "lean on him"?

56:38.042 --> 56:39.709
The Committee Chairman?

56:40.375 --> 56:45.108
That's right, sweetheart. Why do you
think I've been going on about it?

56:48.607 --> 56:50.039
So get to it.

56:51.039 --> 56:52.739
Tomorrow, I'll consult the bosses.

56:52.806 --> 56:57.538
They're going
to run their checks on him.

56:58.571 --> 57:01.770
Get to it, my good people,
and get cracking.

57:23.666 --> 57:24.666
Hello, Dad...

57:25.132 --> 57:26.632
But it's still early.

57:27.465 --> 57:31.198
Oh, I forgot...
Yeah, I'll be right there... Sure, OK.

57:31.864 --> 57:33.564
Yeah, I'm not far.

57:34.563 --> 57:36.463
OK, guys, I'm off.

57:37.563 --> 57:41.128
- Mummy calling you?
- We're going out shooting tomorrow.

57:41.262 --> 57:42.862
You're lucky!

57:43.728 --> 57:46.761
That's right,
go and watch your bedtime cartoons.

58:16.588 --> 58:18.120
Where is everyone?

58:18.654 --> 58:20.453
Mum is asleep.

58:20.553 --> 58:23.853
Dima's in the outhouse
with a magazine.

58:29.485 --> 58:30.751
So, mate,

58:32.717 --> 58:34.517
you like Dima?

58:34.950 --> 58:37.083
Sure. Seems like an all right guy.

58:39.883 --> 58:42.982
That "all right guy"
did a major deed today.

58:43.748 --> 58:44.882
What deed?

58:45.514 --> 58:46.948
He squeezed the mayor.

58:48.481 --> 58:49.547
What?

58:50.213 --> 58:52.080
Just like that, son.

58:52.180 --> 58:53.913
Took him by the balls

58:54.646 --> 58:57.246
and pulled ever so gently.

59:00.278 --> 59:01.645
I don't get it.

59:02.711 --> 59:04.744
You'll get it when you're older.

59:04.844 --> 59:06.010
Listen,

59:06.477 --> 59:08.410
you stink of fire.

59:08.543 --> 59:10.676
Hanging out
in the old church again?

59:10.809 --> 59:11.809
Well, yeah.

59:12.409 --> 59:14.075
Always looking for trouble.

59:15.342 --> 59:18.607
- What kind of trouble?
- Some kind or other.

59:19.841 --> 59:22.574
Stuffing your face right before bed?

59:24.006 --> 59:25.006
Well, yeah.

59:31.305 --> 59:32.671
Come over here.

59:33.404 --> 59:34.437
Sit down.

59:36.203 --> 59:37.503
What is it?

59:40.436 --> 59:41.836
Were you drinking beer?

59:43.502 --> 59:45.935
No. The other guys had some.

59:46.035 --> 59:47.801
I can smell it on you.

59:47.901 --> 59:49.001
Hey, Roma.

59:52.400 --> 59:53.700
What took you so long?

59:53.833 --> 59:55.633
Lay a cable out there?

59:56.299 --> 59:58.699
Interesting book
you've got out there.

01:00:00.198 --> 01:00:02.131
Couldn't put it down?

01:00:04.131 --> 01:00:05.197
Yeah...

01:00:08.696 --> 01:00:10.296
A couple of comedians, eh?

01:00:11.396 --> 01:00:15.962
Yeah, that's our shitty
northern sense of humour.

01:00:21.927 --> 01:00:23.560
What's so funny?

01:00:23.693 --> 01:00:26.926
It's all good, bro.

01:00:28.259 --> 01:00:29.992
It's all good.

01:00:30.525 --> 01:00:32.291
No, seriously, what am I missing?

01:00:34.325 --> 01:00:35.958
Whatever, you idiots...

01:03:04.758 --> 01:03:07.025
Can you do this?

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:09.391
I'll show you. Watch.

01:03:12.324 --> 01:03:14.390
Pasha, turn off that crap.

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:18.156
Dima!

01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:20.189
Come here for a moment.

01:03:23.921 --> 01:03:25.521
Pasha, what the hell?

01:03:25.621 --> 01:03:28.387
Angela, let's enjoy the silence.

01:03:28.487 --> 01:03:30.620
Not enough silence at your place?

01:03:32.352 --> 01:03:33.419
Dima,

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:36.719
- I'm trusting you with my rifle.
- Thanks.

01:03:36.885 --> 01:03:39.385
Every guy should have his own gun,

01:03:39.485 --> 01:03:41.418
so you don't have to share Kolya's.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:42.784
Agreed.

01:03:43.650 --> 01:03:45.317
What will you use then?

01:03:45.450 --> 01:03:46.983
I'll show you.

01:03:47.116 --> 01:03:48.283
You need help, Kolya?

01:03:48.416 --> 01:03:51.482
No, Dima, I've got this.
Relax, kick back.

01:03:51.615 --> 01:03:52.782
You're the guest.

01:03:55.048 --> 01:03:56.647
Wow, Stepanych!

01:03:56.781 --> 01:03:58.214
Someone's armed for war.

01:03:58.347 --> 01:04:01.346
Why not? I like shooting in style.
It's my birthday.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.479
- What, no grenade launcher?
- Show me the target, I'll get one.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:11.278
- Mum, I'm thirsty.
- It's in the car.

01:04:14.577 --> 01:04:17.343
Where are you going?
Out of the water, now!

01:04:17.410 --> 01:04:20.509
Vitya, are you deaf?
I said, get out of the water!

01:04:23.909 --> 01:04:25.141
So, Kolya,

01:04:26.341 --> 01:04:27.608
shall we?

01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.907
Sure.

01:04:33.639 --> 01:04:34.639
Dima,

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.506
Pasha, come on!

01:05:18.297 --> 01:05:19.529
Dima,

01:05:20.463 --> 01:05:23.662
one drink if you hit it,
three if you miss.

01:05:23.796 --> 01:05:25.262
Got it.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.027
One drink!

01:05:35.426 --> 01:05:36.693
Just one!

01:05:36.793 --> 01:05:39.192
To your health, Stepanych!
Cheers!

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:40.625
Same to you.

01:05:41.992 --> 01:05:44.358
Go, Pasha. Nail it.

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:46.091
Don't jinx me.

01:05:54.622 --> 01:05:55.655
Three drinks for him.

01:05:55.755 --> 01:05:58.454
He missed on purpose,
to get shitfaced.

01:05:59.154 --> 01:06:00.988
- Just pour it.
- Have a pickle.

01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.620
To you, Comrade Colonel.

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:05.919
Dima, you show them.

01:06:11.118 --> 01:06:13.251
Anyone can hit it with a sight.

01:06:14.351 --> 01:06:15.751
The sight was closed.

01:06:15.851 --> 01:06:17.650
Are you for me or against me?

01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:20.450
Stepanych.

01:06:20.516 --> 01:06:23.249
Pleasure to meet you,
happy birthday!

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:24.615
Pleasure's all mine.

01:06:30.081 --> 01:06:31.214
Stepanych, just don't...

01:06:35.213 --> 01:06:36.613
Enjoying the silence?

01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:38.379
What did you do that for?

01:06:38.479 --> 01:06:40.712
What do we use for a target now?

01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:43.645
Your hat? Are you fucking crazy?

01:06:43.745 --> 01:06:45.044
Kolya, the kids...

01:06:45.144 --> 01:06:48.110
What about the kids?
They just went deaf.

01:06:48.244 --> 01:06:49.443
No, I heard everything.

01:06:49.577 --> 01:06:53.043
Can't I shoot to my heart's content
on my birthday?

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.176
Well, now you have.

01:06:54.342 --> 01:06:57.342
I've got better targets still.

01:06:59.075 --> 01:07:00.341
Pasha!

01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:01.607
Go get them.

01:07:01.741 --> 01:07:04.240
Angela, shall we get started
on the kebabs?

01:07:06.406 --> 01:07:09.339
- Can I shoot the AK, please?
- Ask Stepanych.

01:07:09.439 --> 01:07:12.039
Stepanych, can I fire your AK?

01:07:12.139 --> 01:07:13.405
Sure.

01:07:13.872 --> 01:07:16.471
He's a grown boy. Let him.

01:07:16.604 --> 01:07:18.903
Stay with us, gals.
It's about to get interesting.

01:07:19.003 --> 01:07:21.137
Call us when it does.

01:07:22.736 --> 01:07:25.569
- I'll go and light the grill.
- Can you manage?

01:07:26.402 --> 01:07:27.435
I think so...

01:07:35.800 --> 01:07:38.067
Nice one, Stepanych!

01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:42.532
Got anyone more current?

01:07:42.632 --> 01:07:45.298
I've got all kinds of stuff.

01:07:45.431 --> 01:07:48.097
But it's too early
for the current ones.

01:07:48.164 --> 01:07:50.530
Not enough
of a historical perspective.

01:07:50.664 --> 01:07:53.030
Let them ripen up on the wall a bit.

01:07:54.229 --> 01:07:55.263
How do we stand them up?

01:07:55.396 --> 01:07:57.695
Nail them to the log.

01:07:58.362 --> 01:07:59.628
Do we have nails?

01:08:00.162 --> 01:08:01.228
No.

01:08:01.794 --> 01:08:03.594
I've got some screws in the car.

01:08:10.526 --> 01:08:12.059
Let's go have a drink.

01:08:12.192 --> 01:08:13.425
Let's.

01:08:19.258 --> 01:08:21.224
I've got Yeltsin, too.

01:08:23.023 --> 01:08:25.689
But he's more small-time.

01:08:26.788 --> 01:08:28.256
The drunken conductor...

01:08:29.587 --> 01:08:31.921
We forgot the nails...
Your fault.

01:08:32.055 --> 01:08:34.854
Look at you, girls!
There's a sight for sore eyes!

01:08:34.987 --> 01:08:37.386
Look at those honed,
precise movements!

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:38.886
Yeah.

01:08:39.020 --> 01:08:40.786
We're quite the roadside attraction!

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:52.051
- Any bread?
- In the bag.

01:08:52.151 --> 01:08:55.649
- What else is there?
- Pickles.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.515
- Help me.
- I'm busy.

01:08:57.616 --> 01:09:00.415
- I'm busy too.
- What are you busy with?

01:09:00.549 --> 01:09:01.747
With stuff...

01:09:04.314 --> 01:09:07.880
Kolya, come here! Let's drink.

01:09:17.377 --> 01:09:18.678
That's enough.

01:09:19.111 --> 01:09:22.477
My oh my, what a guy...

01:09:25.243 --> 01:09:26.809
Where are you off to, Lilya?

01:09:27.376 --> 01:09:29.375
Wouldn't you like to know?

01:09:29.509 --> 01:09:31.575
Did we bring the charcoal?

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:34.008
- What for?
- We'll run out of wood.

01:09:34.108 --> 01:09:37.707
Plenty of driftwood.
Go get some, but have a drink first.

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:39.340
Chase it down.

01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:43.339
Where's my drink?

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:44.606
Here you are.

01:09:46.005 --> 01:09:47.371
Thank you.

01:09:50.671 --> 01:09:52.770
Oh, this is nice!

01:09:54.503 --> 01:09:57.903
- Where is that wood, you say?
- Past the waterfall. You'll see it.

01:09:58.036 --> 01:09:59.202
Got it.

01:10:11.566 --> 01:10:13.933
Vitya, come down here.

01:10:14.033 --> 01:10:15.099
I'm scared.

01:10:15.233 --> 01:10:16.832
- Give me your hand.
- No, I'm scared.

01:10:18.565 --> 01:10:20.398
Suit yourself.

01:10:29.929 --> 01:10:31.429
Where's your kid?

01:10:31.529 --> 01:10:33.062
And where's yours?

01:10:37.794 --> 01:10:39.460
He'll break his neck.

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:41.427
He'll be fine.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.426
Let him run around and enjoy nature.
There are no animals here.

01:10:45.592 --> 01:10:48.158
Man is the most dangerous animal.

01:10:48.258 --> 01:10:50.891
- None of those here either.
- Well, we're here.

01:10:51.025 --> 01:10:54.490
- You calling yourself a man?
- Get a handle on your woman, Pasha.

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:56.324
Too late now.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:00.089
Mummy!

01:11:02.122 --> 01:11:03.655
What happened, Vitya?

01:11:03.755 --> 01:11:06.488
That man is choking Lilya.

01:11:06.588 --> 01:11:08.221
Roma saw it and started crying.

01:11:08.354 --> 01:11:10.453
What are you talking about? What man?

01:11:10.553 --> 01:11:12.453
The handsome one from Moscow.

01:11:19.385 --> 01:11:20.618
You coppers

01:11:20.718 --> 01:11:23.084
just gonna wait
for the mayhem to start?

01:11:23.651 --> 01:11:25.817
Mum, what's "mayhem"?

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.349
- You'll know when you're older.
- I want to know now.

01:11:30.483 --> 01:11:32.982
Let's put that gun away

01:11:33.716 --> 01:11:35.082
from harm.

01:11:40.314 --> 01:11:41.947
Mum, what's "harm"?

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:45.613
Stop annoying me.
Remember when you set the cat on fire?

01:11:46.213 --> 01:11:49.712
- Yeah. Who did it this time?
- Nobody.

01:11:49.845 --> 01:11:52.844
- Then where's the harm?
- Knock it off.

01:11:54.511 --> 01:11:55.877
Oh, God...

01:11:56.611 --> 01:11:58.877
You've got too anxious, Vadim.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:12:03.276
Worrying yourself and others
over nothing.

01:12:03.376 --> 01:12:05.442
As if you don't know

01:12:05.542 --> 01:12:08.874
we're all in God's hands.
It's His will.

01:12:09.008 --> 01:12:11.974
Of course I know, Father.

01:12:12.107 --> 01:12:13.740
So what troubles you?

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.473
Is your faith wavering?

01:12:17.339 --> 01:12:19.838
Do you take communion?
Go to confession?

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.471
Every Sunday, without fail.

01:12:24.437 --> 01:12:25.704
I try to.

01:12:26.404 --> 01:12:29.736
Of course I can't always make it.
I get so busy...

01:12:29.836 --> 01:12:31.370
But I try.

01:12:32.503 --> 01:12:34.602
Who's your confessor?

01:12:38.302 --> 01:12:42.301
Our local priest,
the one you referred me to.

01:12:42.401 --> 01:12:43.867
Father Alexei?

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.367
That's the one.

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.466
He's a good priest.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:50.732
Seems OK.

01:12:52.199 --> 01:12:54.265
Get a hold of yourself, Vadim.

01:12:54.365 --> 01:12:57.498
And don't worry,
you are doing God's work.

01:12:58.164 --> 01:13:00.797
It is said
that good deeds are done

01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:03.129
happily and with ease,

01:13:04.096 --> 01:13:05.829
but don't forget

01:13:05.928 --> 01:13:09.061
the enemy is ever ready
and does not sleep.

01:13:09.161 --> 01:13:10.927
That's the thing.

01:13:11.027 --> 01:13:13.094
You know...

01:13:13.627 --> 01:13:15.994
It's like everything is going wrong.

01:13:17.226 --> 01:13:17.959
I'm uneasy.

01:13:18.493 --> 01:13:19.459
I'm uneasy.

01:13:20.193 --> 01:13:21.292
What's happened is...

01:13:21.392 --> 01:13:24.792
Don't reveal anything to me.
You're not at confession.

01:13:26.624 --> 01:13:28.791
You and I may be working

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:30.957
for the same cause.

01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:35.522
But you've got your territory,
and I've got mine.

01:13:35.656 --> 01:13:37.622
I understand that.

01:13:40.388 --> 01:13:42.454
I just feel ill at ease...

01:13:43.454 --> 01:13:47.320
I told you a couple of days ago,
and I'll tell you again:

01:13:47.453 --> 01:13:49.619
all power is from God.

01:13:50.186 --> 01:13:52.552
Where there's power, there's might.

01:13:52.686 --> 01:13:56.651
If you hold power in your territory,

01:13:57.317 --> 01:14:01.484
solve your issues yourself,
with your might.

01:14:01.616 --> 01:14:04.416
Don't go looking for help,

01:14:04.516 --> 01:14:07.115
or the enemy will think
you are weak.

01:14:10.015 --> 01:14:13.048
Honestly, I have to lecture you
like a child.

01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:14.181
Vadim...

01:14:15.613 --> 01:14:17.480
I don't recognize you like this.

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.779
Everything OK with the wife?

01:14:22.646 --> 01:14:24.212
I think so.

01:14:24.345 --> 01:14:25.745
How are the kids?

01:14:26.478 --> 01:14:28.044
They're fine.

01:14:29.310 --> 01:14:30.777
You're not sick?

01:14:33.477 --> 01:14:34.909
No.

01:14:40.942 --> 01:14:42.908
That's a blessing.

01:14:51.906 --> 01:14:53.672
God bless you.

01:15:52.393 --> 01:15:54.626
It's all my fault.

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:56.659
No such thing.

01:15:57.659 --> 01:16:00.158
Each of us is guilty
of our own faults.

01:16:01.424 --> 01:16:03.624
Everything is everyone's fault.

01:16:05.457 --> 01:16:07.956
Even if we confess,

01:16:08.389 --> 01:16:11.356
the law doesn't hold it
to be a proof of guilt.

01:16:13.322 --> 01:16:16.321
We're innocent until proven guilty.

01:16:20.486 --> 01:16:23.653
But who's going to prove anything?
And to whom?

01:16:27.652 --> 01:16:29.418
Do you believe in God?

01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:33.551
Why do you all keep
asking me about God?

01:16:33.651 --> 01:16:35.183
I believe in facts.

01:16:35.317 --> 01:16:37.150
I'm a lawyer, Lilya.

01:16:46.248 --> 01:16:49.247
Don't. Please.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.947
No confessions.

01:16:57.778 --> 01:17:00.311
Because there's no proof?

01:17:02.744 --> 01:17:04.377
And there won't be any.

01:17:11.943 --> 01:17:14.075
Will you come with me?

01:17:22.007 --> 01:17:24.406
I don't understand you.

01:17:26.139 --> 01:17:28.305
I don't understand myself.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:13.562
I'd love to run away
with someone too.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:16.361
Women are dumb.

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:19.461
Why?

01:18:21.427 --> 01:18:23.727
Because you can't run away
from yourself.

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.226
Maybe not,

01:18:26.359 --> 01:18:29.126
but I sure can run away from you.

01:18:32.092 --> 01:18:33.658
Where to?

01:18:35.025 --> 01:18:36.757
To whore around in Moscow?

01:18:36.857 --> 01:18:38.890
- Why "whore around"?
- Because you're a whore.

01:18:42.923 --> 01:18:44.255
See that?

01:18:44.355 --> 01:18:45.555
Want me to smack you too?

01:18:45.689 --> 01:18:46.755
What?

01:18:47.522 --> 01:18:50.421
You guys can't take a joke?

01:18:52.287 --> 01:18:56.453
I think I'd run
all the way to America.

01:18:57.386 --> 01:19:00.119
Great. Why not the moon?

01:19:00.252 --> 01:19:02.851
Are you asking for another slap?

01:19:04.951 --> 01:19:06.718
Are the boys asleep?

01:19:07.318 --> 01:19:08.717
Yeah.

01:19:10.517 --> 01:19:12.249
Roma...

01:19:13.683 --> 01:19:14.849
he's...

01:19:16.016 --> 01:19:17.282
depressed.

01:19:17.815 --> 01:19:19.515
That's understandable.

01:19:20.947 --> 01:19:22.914
I'll talk to him tomorrow.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.180
Kolya,

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:27.680
don't drink so much again.

01:19:29.579 --> 01:19:32.878
Roma's traumatized enough as it is.

01:19:33.378 --> 01:19:34.844
I won't.

01:19:37.211 --> 01:19:38.244
Good.

01:19:58.973 --> 01:20:00.606
She's back.

01:20:02.272 --> 01:20:05.138
- Thank God.
- Maybe she's getting her things.

01:20:05.905 --> 01:20:10.037
Shut up, Pasha. Go get Vitya.

01:20:12.204 --> 01:20:13.970
Are you OK to drive?

01:20:15.469 --> 01:20:17.202
I'm a traffic cop, aren't I?

01:20:37.731 --> 01:20:39.064
Vitya...

01:20:47.929 --> 01:20:50.795
Well, we'll be off.

01:20:51.928 --> 01:20:53.761
So just, you know...

01:21:25.654 --> 01:21:26.854
Kolya...

01:21:39.251 --> 01:21:41.251
Do you want a child?

01:22:14.177 --> 01:22:16.343
Hello? Yes, Vadim.

01:22:17.476 --> 01:22:19.143
Yes, I recognized you.

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:25.141
Sure, let's meet.

01:22:27.141 --> 01:22:28.640
I'm at the hotel.

01:22:32.173 --> 01:22:33.939
Half an hour is good.

01:22:47.670 --> 01:22:49.370
Can I see those?

01:22:49.502 --> 01:22:50.702
These?

01:22:55.635 --> 01:22:57.134
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

01:23:23.562 --> 01:23:25.462
Well, get in.

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:28.694
I won't bite. Come on!

01:23:29.494 --> 01:23:30.593
You're a tough guy.

01:23:30.693 --> 01:23:32.160
If I'm not back here in two hours...

01:23:32.260 --> 01:23:34.393
You will be, don't worry.

01:23:45.724 --> 01:23:47.523
Rough night?

01:23:47.657 --> 01:23:49.323
You're all puffy.

01:23:49.423 --> 01:23:51.123
Where are we going?

01:23:51.223 --> 01:23:53.156
You'll see.

01:23:53.256 --> 01:23:55.022
You'll like it.

01:23:55.122 --> 01:23:56.888
We'll sit and talk things over.

01:23:57.021 --> 01:23:58.055
What things?

01:23:58.188 --> 01:24:01.654
What do you mean?
You want money, right?

01:24:02.687 --> 01:24:04.320
And I want guarantees.

01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:05.919
Guarantees of what?

01:24:06.053 --> 01:24:08.519
See, we're already talking.

01:24:11.585 --> 01:24:14.684
Just a quick tete-a-tete, you know.

01:25:37.366 --> 01:25:38.399
So,

01:25:39.099 --> 01:25:40.699
how does it feel?

01:25:42.798 --> 01:25:44.632
Why did you hit him in the face?

01:25:45.198 --> 01:25:46.198
Although...

01:25:46.331 --> 01:25:47.331
Ruslan!

01:25:49.197 --> 01:25:50.463
Nothing to say?

01:25:53.063 --> 01:25:56.029
No last words? No?

01:25:58.295 --> 01:26:01.828
Not even a few
for your daughter maybe?

01:26:02.928 --> 01:26:04.894
- What?
- That's enough.

01:26:04.994 --> 01:26:08.127
Fine. We'll honor your last wish.

01:26:47.618 --> 01:26:50.517
A public-private partnership.

01:26:50.584 --> 01:26:52.450
A spot with great potential.

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:55.483
Close to the center, by the sea.

01:26:57.582 --> 01:26:58.948
I'm very happy,

01:26:59.382 --> 01:27:02.115
because this is a brand of sorts.

01:27:02.248 --> 01:27:04.147
I mean, your brand.

01:27:04.247 --> 01:27:08.946
And people trust brands these days.
Officials hold high hopes for them.

01:27:13.045 --> 01:27:16.745
The main thing now is
to keep the momentum.

01:27:17.644 --> 01:27:21.777
The desire to make headway,
to work and move things forward.

01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:27.742
I'll send my guy over today.

01:27:27.842 --> 01:27:29.209
No, no, today.

01:27:29.742 --> 01:27:31.041
It's a deal then.

01:27:39.540 --> 01:27:41.773
What do you mean, "crystal"?

01:27:42.539 --> 01:27:44.639
That's your problem.

01:27:44.739 --> 01:27:48.105
I told you loud and clear:
you get going, whatever it takes.

01:27:48.205 --> 01:27:52.237
If you can't get going,
we'll find someone who can.

01:27:53.404 --> 01:27:54.636
All right, back to work.

01:32:28.344 --> 01:32:29.977
So, how's Kolya?

01:32:30.110 --> 01:32:32.344
He threatened to kill you both.

01:32:32.444 --> 01:32:35.176
Then had a few drinks
and calmed down.

01:32:37.309 --> 01:32:38.975
He loves you.

01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:44.741
What about the other one?

01:32:46.407 --> 01:32:48.307
Did he ask you to go to Moscow?

01:35:58.032 --> 01:35:59.832
OK, fine.

01:36:00.365 --> 01:36:03.264
Come pick it up.
But make it quick, OK?

01:36:13.462 --> 01:36:15.762
He's taking the boat tomorrow.

01:36:21.527 --> 01:36:23.794
I'm selling it all off for nothing.

01:36:29.725 --> 01:36:33.724
If that bastard builds himself
a palace here, I'll burn it down.

01:36:35.724 --> 01:36:37.523
Hey, wandering spirit!

01:36:39.123 --> 01:36:41.156
Why did you leave your phone?

01:36:44.622 --> 01:36:45.722
Roma!

01:37:08.684 --> 01:37:09.684
Listen...

01:37:09.850 --> 01:37:11.150
What do you want?

01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:14.949
You ruined everything!
It's all because of you!

01:37:15.015 --> 01:37:16.315
I hate you!

01:37:16.482 --> 01:37:17.982
What is it, Roma?

01:37:18.515 --> 01:37:21.614
I don't want to live with you
anymore! I'm sick of you!

01:37:21.681 --> 01:37:22.981
Son, calm down.

01:37:23.147 --> 01:37:25.913
- Stay away from me!
- Stop it...

01:37:26.613 --> 01:37:28.046
What's with you?

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:32.279
Get her out of here, Dad!

01:37:32.379 --> 01:37:33.845
Get out!

01:37:35.045 --> 01:37:36.311
Dad...

01:37:37.944 --> 01:37:40.377
It's going to be OK.

01:40:55.468 --> 01:40:56.967
What?

01:40:57.101 --> 01:40:59.200
Forgive her. She's...

01:41:02.133 --> 01:41:03.666
She's a good person.

01:41:03.799 --> 01:41:05.965
Have you forgiven her?

01:41:06.065 --> 01:41:07.465
I'm trying.

01:41:10.664 --> 01:41:12.431
OK, better get going.

01:41:38.792 --> 01:41:40.725
Put it down here.

01:41:49.956 --> 01:41:50.989
Hey.

01:41:51.156 --> 01:41:53.022
- Where's Lilya?
- She didn't come today.

01:41:53.155 --> 01:41:55.388
- What?
- I'm serious.

01:41:57.654 --> 01:42:00.354
I tried calling her too -
says "number unavailable".

01:42:00.454 --> 01:42:02.320
Isn't she home?

01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:05.053
Number unavailable.

01:42:05.153 --> 01:42:07.052
OK, I'll be off.

01:42:08.152 --> 01:42:09.652
Can you give me a lift?

01:42:10.151 --> 01:42:12.551
- What?
- Can I get a lift?

01:42:12.651 --> 01:42:14.651
Oh, sure, get in.

01:44:22.290 --> 01:44:25.022
She ran off to him. To Moscow.

01:44:25.122 --> 01:44:27.322
I don't doubt it for a second.

01:44:29.521 --> 01:44:31.721
What else could have happened?

01:44:31.821 --> 01:44:34.954
Anything. Do you know
how many people go missing?

01:44:35.087 --> 01:44:36.853
I don't believe in "anything".

01:44:36.953 --> 01:44:38.787
What about the cops?

01:44:39.486 --> 01:44:40.819
What about them?

01:44:41.919 --> 01:44:43.718
Have to wait three days.

01:44:43.818 --> 01:44:45.185
That's a bunch of shit.

01:44:45.285 --> 01:44:46.818
You can report it right away.

01:44:46.951 --> 01:44:51.084
Take it from the wife
of a law enforcement officer.

01:44:51.417 --> 01:44:52.350
OK,

01:44:52.850 --> 01:44:55.416
I go to the cops and tell them what?

01:44:55.549 --> 01:44:58.582
"My wife ran off to Moscow
to her lover.

01:44:58.715 --> 01:45:02.914
"Here's her name and number.
Get her back."

01:45:03.781 --> 01:45:06.447
Hey, if you want,
I can call him right now.

01:45:06.847 --> 01:45:08.513
I already tried over and over.

01:45:08.613 --> 01:45:09.780
And?

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.946
Nothing. No answer.

01:45:12.612 --> 01:45:14.645
We have to do something.

01:45:21.777 --> 01:45:23.243
And I wouldn't be surprised

01:45:23.377 --> 01:45:27.709
if he took my money
from that bastard and bailed.

01:45:27.809 --> 01:45:30.075
And she joined him later.

01:46:35.128 --> 01:46:36.627
Hi, Kolya.

01:46:37.827 --> 01:46:38.961
Where's Roma?

01:46:39.127 --> 01:46:40.893
He went home.

01:46:41.793 --> 01:46:44.592
- When?
- About 20 minutes ago.

01:47:46.512 --> 01:47:48.246
Get the door!

01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:16.372
They found her.

01:49:31.223 --> 01:49:32.923
Move away.

01:49:33.956 --> 01:49:35.489
Come on.

01:50:11.915 --> 01:50:13.181
Why?

01:50:18.046 --> 01:50:19.946
Why, Lord?

01:50:59.704 --> 01:51:00.870
What can I get you, Kolya?

01:51:01.004 --> 01:51:03.236
Vodka, what else? 2 bottles.

01:51:11.634 --> 01:51:13.101
Hello, Kolya.

01:51:13.834 --> 01:51:15.734
Hey, Father Vasily.

01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.194
Well?

01:51:50.026 --> 01:51:51.526
Where's your...

01:51:51.659 --> 01:51:54.692
merciful God Almighty?

01:51:56.425 --> 01:51:58.192
Mine is with me.

01:51:58.724 --> 01:52:00.757
As for yours, I wouldn't know.

01:52:02.623 --> 01:52:04.557
Who do you pray to?

01:52:06.056 --> 01:52:08.289
Haven't seen you in church.

01:52:09.922 --> 01:52:12.621
You don't fast, take communion
or go to confession.

01:52:12.721 --> 01:52:16.854
If I lit candles and all,
would things be different?

01:52:17.020 --> 01:52:19.820
Maybe it's not too late to start?

01:52:20.453 --> 01:52:22.686
Would I get my wife
back from the dead?

01:52:22.819 --> 01:52:24.652
And my house?

01:52:25.052 --> 01:52:26.785
Or is it too late?

01:52:27.485 --> 01:52:28.718
I don't know.

01:52:28.851 --> 01:52:31.251
Our Lord moves in mysterious ways.

01:52:31.351 --> 01:52:33.117
You don't know?

01:52:33.217 --> 01:52:36.883
Then why do you call me
to confession?

01:52:38.583 --> 01:52:40.282
What do you know then?

01:52:40.449 --> 01:52:42.515
- Want some?
- No.

01:52:47.114 --> 01:52:49.947
"Can you pull in Leviathan
with a fishhook

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.380
"or tie down its tongue with a rope?

01:52:54.012 --> 01:52:56.579
"Will it keep begging you for mercy?

01:52:56.679 --> 01:53:00.011
"Will it speak to you
with gentle words?

01:53:00.545 --> 01:53:02.978
"Nothing on earth is its equal.

01:53:03.677 --> 01:53:05.810
"It is king over all that are proud."

01:53:05.910 --> 01:53:07.409
Father Vasily...

01:53:08.609 --> 01:53:11.142
I'm talking to you
as a regular person.

01:53:11.276 --> 01:53:13.375
Why the fucking riddles?

01:53:13.475 --> 01:53:15.008
What for?

01:53:15.141 --> 01:53:18.041
Have you heard of a man called Job?

01:53:18.474 --> 01:53:21.973
Like you, he was preoccupied
with the meaning of life.

01:53:22.106 --> 01:53:24.806
"Why?" he asked.
"Why me of all people?"

01:53:24.939 --> 01:53:28.072
He worried so much
he became covered with scabs.

01:53:28.172 --> 01:53:31.971
His wife tried to talk some sense
into him; his friends told him

01:53:32.438 --> 01:53:34.104
to not evoke God's anger.

01:53:34.204 --> 01:53:38.070
But he kept kicking up dust
and sprinkling ash on his head.

01:53:38.136 --> 01:53:41.036
Then the Lord relented

01:53:41.169 --> 01:53:42.635
and appeared to him

01:53:42.769 --> 01:53:44.769
in the form of a hurricane

01:53:44.901 --> 01:53:48.034
and explained everything to him
in pictures.

01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:49.334
And?

01:53:49.834 --> 01:53:52.067
Job resigned himself to his fate

01:53:52.167 --> 01:53:54.633
and lived to be 140.

01:53:54.733 --> 01:53:58.766
Got to see 4 generations
of his family

01:53:59.398 --> 01:54:01.498
and died old

01:54:01.631 --> 01:54:02.797
and content.

01:54:02.931 --> 01:54:04.464
Is that a fairy tale?

01:54:08.030 --> 01:54:09.296
No,

01:54:09.696 --> 01:54:11.729
it's in the Bible.

01:54:11.863 --> 01:54:14.995
Let me help you carry that.
Come on.

01:54:27.659 --> 01:54:28.892
Thanks.

01:54:30.825 --> 01:54:34.558
The funeral service is tomorrow.
They just called.

01:54:48.955 --> 01:54:51.054
Yulia, there's some bread for you.

01:54:51.187 --> 01:54:52.454
God bless you.

01:54:52.587 --> 01:54:54.886
Glory be to God. Eat up.

01:55:11.216 --> 01:55:12.550
How terrible...

01:55:17.115 --> 01:55:19.981
Do you think she did this herself?

01:55:20.648 --> 01:55:22.447
The forensic tests will tell.

01:55:29.246 --> 01:55:30.646
Remember

01:55:31.512 --> 01:55:34.145
how Kolya threatened to kill her?

01:55:34.278 --> 01:55:36.677
- Come on now.
- He did.

01:55:36.844 --> 01:55:39.077
- So what?
- He could have done it.

01:55:39.177 --> 01:55:41.510
He's capable, I swear.

01:55:42.676 --> 01:55:44.309
- You hear me?
- What the hell?

01:55:44.443 --> 01:55:46.775
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.

01:55:46.875 --> 01:55:49.742
- And?
- You're the cop. You tell me.

01:55:51.474 --> 01:55:53.274
Use your brain.

01:56:14.769 --> 01:56:15.902
Dad...

01:56:18.035 --> 01:56:19.568
Will you ever stop drinking?

01:56:19.668 --> 01:56:20.868
I will.

01:56:21.935 --> 01:56:25.234
I'm quitting tomorrow.
You believe me?

01:56:28.766 --> 01:56:30.066
Son...

01:56:32.832 --> 01:56:35.464
Sit. Let's talk.

01:56:35.598 --> 01:56:37.798
Forget it. I'm going out.

01:56:46.462 --> 01:56:47.862
All right.

01:56:51.894 --> 01:56:53.094
Go.

01:57:01.093 --> 01:57:04.258
- Hello.
- Hi. Is your dad home?

01:57:04.392 --> 01:57:06.558
- He's asleep.
- I see.

01:57:07.025 --> 01:57:08.724
- Hey, where are you going?
- Easy, easy.

01:57:08.857 --> 01:57:11.490
- Dad! Some guys just barged in!
- Sit down and be quiet.

01:57:11.590 --> 01:57:13.456
- What?
- Sit down, I said.

01:57:13.590 --> 01:57:16.423
Get up. Homicide department.

01:57:16.556 --> 01:57:18.755
You ignored the court order.

01:57:18.889 --> 01:57:20.588
What court order?

01:57:21.122 --> 01:57:22.421
This one.

01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:29.420
Roma!

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.052
Sit down!

01:57:47.916 --> 01:57:49.116
Dad!

01:58:12.244 --> 01:58:15.710
We have every reason to believe
you killed your wife

01:58:15.843 --> 01:58:17.910
and then faked her drowning.

01:58:18.776 --> 01:58:19.809
What?

01:58:21.575 --> 01:58:22.575
Are you crazy?

01:58:24.474 --> 01:58:26.608
We discovered signs of violence
on the body.

01:58:26.674 --> 01:58:29.073
She was murdered,
then pushed into the water.

01:58:29.207 --> 01:58:31.906
She died from a blow
with a blunt object

01:58:32.039 --> 01:58:34.139
to the back of her head.

01:58:34.239 --> 01:58:37.705
Not long before that,
she had sexual intercourse.

01:58:37.838 --> 01:58:40.971
The investigation is looking
into the possibility of rape.

01:58:41.804 --> 01:58:44.737
We'll take your sperm for tests.
Something tells me

01:58:44.904 --> 01:58:46.970
it will be a match.

01:58:48.269 --> 01:58:49.603
Next,

01:58:50.735 --> 01:58:54.768
we have testimony
from Angela Polivanova

01:58:55.968 --> 01:58:59.301
and her husband, Pasha Polivanov

01:59:00.100 --> 01:59:03.532
to the effect that a few days
prior to the murder,

01:59:03.666 --> 01:59:05.432
while at a picnic,

01:59:05.566 --> 01:59:08.031
you had a fight with your wife

01:59:08.199 --> 01:59:10.565
and her lover in front of witnesses.

01:59:10.698 --> 01:59:13.098
after you caught them having sex.

01:59:13.264 --> 01:59:15.463
You beat up the lover,

01:59:15.597 --> 01:59:16.963
a man called Dmitri,

01:59:17.497 --> 01:59:19.363
whose identity
is currently being established,

01:59:19.463 --> 01:59:23.495
then hit your wife, and afterwards
threatened to kill them both.

01:59:24.128 --> 01:59:26.261
This testimony was confirmed

01:59:27.561 --> 01:59:29.660
by Ivan Stepanych Degtyaryev,

01:59:30.394 --> 01:59:33.060
Lieutenant Colonel
of the traffic police,

01:59:33.226 --> 01:59:36.459
who was also present.

01:59:37.492 --> 01:59:40.824
In addition,
the suspected murder weapon,

01:59:40.924 --> 01:59:44.624
a hammer with the shape matching
that of the Victim's head wound,

01:59:45.491 --> 01:59:50.090
was found in a building
on your property.

01:59:50.222 --> 01:59:52.222
It has been taken for testing.

01:59:52.689 --> 01:59:55.555
Would you like to comment
on any of this?

01:59:56.588 --> 01:59:59.620
Personally, I would advise you

02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:02.120
to write a full confession.

02:00:02.220 --> 02:00:04.486
We have more than enough evidence.

02:00:04.586 --> 02:00:07.352
A confession may reduce the sentence.

02:00:07.852 --> 02:00:10.052
Pursuant to Article 105 Part 1,

02:00:10.552 --> 02:00:13.684
you'll get up to 15 years

02:00:13.784 --> 02:00:16.250
unless there are
aggravating circumstances,

02:00:16.350 --> 02:00:19.450
in which case,
it'll be up to 20 years.

02:00:22.483 --> 02:00:23.849
Right...

02:00:24.782 --> 02:00:27.681
In any case,
we're detaining you for 48 hours

02:00:27.781 --> 02:00:29.781
as a murder suspect.

02:00:30.781 --> 02:00:33.947
I'll petition the court
for a warrant for your arrest

02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:39.145
as a flight risk and as someone
who might impede the investigation.

02:00:46.044 --> 02:00:47.244
Also...

02:00:47.810 --> 02:00:50.709
you have the right to a lawyer.

02:00:50.843 --> 02:00:53.209
If you don't have a lawyer,

02:00:53.309 --> 02:00:55.375
the state will appoint one for you.

02:00:56.275 --> 02:00:57.941
Do you understand?

02:01:01.241 --> 02:01:03.407
I don't understand any of this.

02:01:04.174 --> 02:01:06.406
You'll have plenty of time
to think it over.

02:01:56.029 --> 02:01:57.995
- Hello.
- Just one?

02:01:58.095 --> 02:01:59.528
Just one.

02:02:04.427 --> 02:02:05.627
Listen...

02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:10.492
My son's left all alone.

02:02:11.759 --> 02:02:13.191
We've got no relatives.

02:02:13.325 --> 02:02:14.725
Don't shit yourself.

02:02:15.425 --> 02:02:17.590
The state will take care of him.

02:03:13.978 --> 02:03:16.678
Roma, open up.
It's Angela and Pasha.

02:03:16.811 --> 02:03:18.377
Are you alone?

02:03:18.477 --> 02:03:19.644
Yes, it's just us.

02:03:25.576 --> 02:03:27.043
How are you?

02:03:27.543 --> 02:03:28.875
I'm all right.

02:03:29.542 --> 02:03:32.641
Why didn't you call me
when they took your dad?

02:03:33.574 --> 02:03:35.474
I don't have your number.

02:03:38.207 --> 02:03:40.406
How long have you
been here alone?

02:03:40.540 --> 02:03:41.740
I don't know.

02:03:42.606 --> 02:03:44.672
5 days, I think.

02:03:46.005 --> 02:03:47.205
Roma...

02:03:48.638 --> 02:03:50.638
A lawyer called.

02:03:51.737 --> 02:03:54.437
Your dad was accused
of murdering Lilya.

02:03:55.337 --> 02:03:59.436
He'll be in jail till the trial.
Then, they'll take him to prison.

02:04:00.668 --> 02:04:02.435
They have proof.

02:04:02.535 --> 02:04:03.901
That's not true.

02:04:04.001 --> 02:04:05.934
Why would I lie to you?

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:11.466
Why didn't he call me?
They must let him call me.

02:04:11.566 --> 02:04:13.166
Look, Roma,

02:04:13.965 --> 02:04:17.165
the lawyer said that
if there's no one to take care of you,

02:04:17.265 --> 02:04:18.964
they'll put you in an orphanage.

02:04:19.798 --> 02:04:21.897
I can take care of myself.

02:04:21.997 --> 02:04:25.030
By law, until you turn 18,

02:04:25.163 --> 02:04:28.496
you must live
in an orphanage or with a guardian.

02:04:29.429 --> 02:04:31.629
Pasha and I talked it over...

02:04:32.261 --> 02:04:34.561
We'd like to be your guardians.

02:04:34.661 --> 02:04:36.560
You've got no one else, right?

02:04:42.626 --> 02:04:44.026
Is it because of the money?

02:04:44.626 --> 02:04:45.958
What money?

02:04:46.058 --> 02:04:47.758
Won't you get paid for it?

02:04:47.858 --> 02:04:49.658
How should I know?

02:04:51.157 --> 02:04:54.624
But if you agree,
I'll definitely find out.

02:04:54.757 --> 02:04:57.723
I guess the state
would probably help out,

02:04:58.423 --> 02:05:00.455
but that's not why we're offering.

02:05:01.022 --> 02:05:02.655
Why then?

02:05:03.822 --> 02:05:05.188
I don't know.

02:05:06.521 --> 02:05:07.821
You're like...

02:05:08.521 --> 02:05:10.053
family to us.

02:05:10.753 --> 02:05:12.386
Your mum and I were friends.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:15.552
You were little when she died.

02:05:16.885 --> 02:05:20.984
I went to school with your parents.
And Lilya. She was a bit younger.

02:05:32.948 --> 02:05:34.582
I'll step out for a smoke.

02:07:34.422 --> 02:07:37.489
Pribrezhny Town Court
has ruled as follows:

02:07:37.621 --> 02:07:41.221
The Panel of Judges,

02:07:41.321 --> 02:07:46.887
presided over by Mrs. Tarasova,
examined Mr. Sergeyev's petition

02:07:46.987 --> 02:07:49.919
to appeal the ruling
on case No. 06-18.

02:07:50.052 --> 02:07:53.818
In the presence of Mr. Sergeyev,
the court has determined that:

02:07:53.951 --> 02:07:56.784
Mr. Sergeyev,
who has no previous convictions,

02:07:56.917 --> 02:08:00.284
is convicted in accordance
with Article 105 of the Criminal Code

02:08:00.384 --> 02:08:03.949
and sentenced to 15 years
in a maximum-security penitentiary.

02:08:04.083 --> 02:08:06.849
The ruling also addressed
evidence in the case:

02:08:06.949 --> 02:08:11.581
Mr. Sergeyev was convicted
of premeditated murder of his wife.

02:08:11.681 --> 02:08:15.380
The circumstances of the crime
are outlined in the ruling.

02:08:15.480 --> 02:08:18.013
Mr. Sergeyev refused
to confess to the crime.

02:08:18.146 --> 02:08:22.579
He filed an appeal requesting
that the ruling be repealed.

02:08:22.679 --> 02:08:26.778
Mr. Sergeyev claims that his guilt
in the case was not proven.

02:08:26.911 --> 02:08:31.843
The court considers the ruling
not subject to repeal.

02:08:32.277 --> 02:08:35.476
All circumstances
were thoroughly examined by the court

02:08:35.609 --> 02:08:37.808
and all evidence
given due consideration.

02:08:37.942 --> 02:08:41.475
The defendant's claim of innocence
was reviewed by the court

02:08:41.607 --> 02:08:42.807
and soundly rejected.

02:09:04.303 --> 02:09:05.602
Hello?

02:09:10.069 --> 02:09:11.701
15 years?

02:09:11.835 --> 02:09:13.601
Well, thank God.

02:09:13.734 --> 02:09:16.367
That'll teach him to know his place.

02:09:17.767 --> 02:09:19.566
Yeah, later.

02:09:25.498 --> 02:09:26.931
One more.

02:09:46.493 --> 02:09:51.660
We probably don't even realize yet
what is really happening.

02:09:52.426 --> 02:09:54.792
We are reawakening

02:09:55.592 --> 02:09:58.025
the soul of the Russian people.

02:09:59.058 --> 02:10:03.923
As the Great Prince
St. Alexander Nevsky

02:10:04.057 --> 02:10:06.356
wonderfully put it:

02:10:06.456 --> 02:10:10.156
"God dwells not in strength,
but in truth."

02:10:10.256 --> 02:10:14.021
And he was right:
not with strength, but with love;

02:10:14.121 --> 02:10:15.854
not with cunning,

02:10:15.954 --> 02:10:18.220
but with the Lord's wisdom;

02:10:18.320 --> 02:10:21.486
not with anger and hatred,
but with bravery

02:10:21.619 --> 02:10:26.019
have we overcome the many enemies
of our faith and our Motherland.

02:10:27.118 --> 02:10:30.351
But the most important thing today

02:10:31.184 --> 02:10:33.551
is that we must

02:10:33.683 --> 02:10:35.750
uphold the Orthodox faith

02:10:35.850 --> 02:10:38.050
and always speak truthfully.

02:10:38.549 --> 02:10:40.082
Truth

02:10:40.215 --> 02:10:42.681
is God's legacy.

02:10:42.781 --> 02:10:47.480
Truth reflects the world
as it really is, without distortion.

02:10:48.214 --> 02:10:53.346
But only he who knows God's truth
can find truth.

02:10:53.446 --> 02:10:57.245
And God's truth
is Christ Himself.

02:10:57.378 --> 02:10:59.878
This is why, when Apostle Paul said,

02:10:59.978 --> 02:11:03.410
"I no longer live,
but Christ lives in me"

02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:08.443
he meant that when a man
lets Christ into his soul -

02:11:09.143 --> 02:11:11.575
in other words,
begins to think like Christ,

02:11:11.675 --> 02:11:13.342
see like Christ

02:11:13.442 --> 02:11:16.674
and act like the Lord commanded -

02:11:16.774 --> 02:11:21.107
only then does this man
possess truth.

02:11:21.806 --> 02:11:24.372
And that means he can regard events

02:11:25.272 --> 02:11:27.572
and see their true meaning

02:11:27.672 --> 02:11:30.971
and tell good from evil.

02:11:31.104 --> 02:11:34.470
And that is the essence of truth.

02:11:34.570 --> 02:11:38.636
When people destroy crosses,

02:11:38.703 --> 02:11:42.568
break icons, defile the Crucifix

02:11:43.502 --> 02:11:46.501
and blaspheme by calling
demonic rites a prayer,

02:11:46.635 --> 02:11:49.467
when people try to convince others

02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:52.566
that they do this
out of good intentions,

02:11:52.666 --> 02:11:54.399
they are passing off lies

02:11:54.533 --> 02:11:56.865
as the truth.

02:11:56.965 --> 02:11:58.732
How can one

02:11:58.865 --> 02:12:02.698
preach freedom
while destroying the foundations

02:12:02.798 --> 02:12:04.864
of morality?

02:12:04.964 --> 02:12:08.763
Freedom is finding God's truth.

02:12:08.896 --> 02:12:11.562
The Bible teaches us this.

02:12:11.696 --> 02:12:15.728
Know God's truth,
and it shall set you free.

02:12:17.661 --> 02:12:21.694
Only man who knows God's truth,
who lives by it,

02:12:21.794 --> 02:12:23.759
who defends it -

02:12:23.859 --> 02:12:26.393
only that man is truly free.

02:12:27.626 --> 02:12:32.091
My beloved brothers and sisters
in Christ!

02:12:32.225 --> 02:12:37.690
The world today is constantly
changing its reference points.

02:12:38.324 --> 02:12:40.823
True values

02:12:41.356 --> 02:12:43.555
are being replaced with false ones.

02:12:43.689 --> 02:12:46.922
But even in this world,

02:12:47.854 --> 02:12:51.521
our path remains unchanged:
it leads to Christ.

02:12:51.653 --> 02:12:55.720
We know that the Church
will protect and guide us

02:12:55.853 --> 02:12:59.485
but the Church consists
of you and me.

02:12:59.585 --> 02:13:01.119
God is with us.

02:13:01.219 --> 02:13:04.018
Truth is with us.
The Lord's love is with us...

02:13:05.618 --> 02:13:07.850
God sees everything, son.

02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:12.782
And in defending our faith, we will
not liken ourselves to our enemies

02:13:12.882 --> 02:13:14.416
but just as Christ

02:13:14.549 --> 02:13:18.515
shed light on the truth
and unmasked the lies with one word,

02:13:18.648 --> 02:13:22.180
so will we,
enlightened by the Church,

02:13:22.714 --> 02:13:25.446
the World of God and saintly prayer

02:13:25.546 --> 02:13:27.713
defend the Orthodox faith.

02:13:29.013 --> 02:13:31.345
I'm so glad
that you're pleased, sir.

02:13:31.445 --> 02:13:33.644
Thanks a lot. We try.

02:13:37.411 --> 02:13:40.810
It's not quite finished yet,
but it will be soon.

02:13:41.576 --> 02:13:45.642
We'll do some landscaping,
maybe build a refectory.

02:13:45.742 --> 02:13:48.641
As soon as it's all finished,
I'll call you right away.

02:13:49.641 --> 02:13:52.607
- I have every faith in you.
- Thank you so much.

02:13:53.307 --> 02:13:54.673
Where's my family?

02:13:54.807 --> 02:13:57.107
Come on, sweetie, get in the car.
