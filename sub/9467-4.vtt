00:01.568 --> 00:01.634
.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.714
Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:14.714 --> 00:17.517
the show that brings you
stories from history...

00:17.517 --> 00:19.285
Fuck that horse.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.354
...as told by blind drunk comedians.

00:21.354 --> 00:22.589
(laughs)

00:22.589 --> 00:24.958
Our storytellers step back in time,

00:24.958 --> 00:27.927
but the time they're most interested
in is happy hour.

00:27.927 --> 00:29.929
You fucked your sister.

00:29.929 --> 00:31.931
(screams)

00:31.931 --> 00:34.768
Lads, lads, lads.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.770
I'm king of England.
I do what I want.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.805
You'll have the time of your lives.

00:39.773 --> 00:41.374
You fucking lightweight.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.721
We start tonight
with the story of Richard III

00:54.721 --> 00:57.524
who conspired to steal the throne
from his nephews.

00:57.524 --> 00:59.926
That sounds complicated,
but don't worry.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.762
If you've seen Game of Thrones,
you've got this.

01:02.762 --> 01:05.598
Tom Rosenthal tells this
having knocked back...

01:12.405 --> 01:13.706
Good luck, Tom.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.576
(crew laugh)

01:17.944 --> 01:19.345
Listen up.

01:19.345 --> 01:22.315
There are lots of creepy uncles
in this world,

01:22.315 --> 01:26.953
but let me tell you a story
of the creepiest uncle of all time.

01:26.953 --> 01:30.323
This be the story
of King Richard III.

01:30.323 --> 01:34.594
The year is 1483 anno donomoni

01:34.594 --> 01:38.198
and King Edward IV is seriously ill.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.733
He is about to die.

01:40.733 --> 01:44.804
Eddie V, Eddie Five, I named you
after myself cos you're my boy.

01:44.804 --> 01:49.309
I'm gonna give you this country. You
have it, do with it what you will.

01:49.309 --> 01:51.711
(groans)

01:52.712 --> 01:53.813
That's him dying.

01:53.813 --> 01:59.118
So Eddie V is technically the king,
but the country goes,

01:59.118 --> 02:02.489
"We can't give the country of England
to a 12-year-old."

02:02.489 --> 02:06.493
(slurs) He hasn't even got pubes,
ain't even kissed girls on the mouth.

02:06.493 --> 02:09.496
So Richard III,
who was Edward's uncle...

02:11.064 --> 02:13.233
He stepped up to the plate
and he said,

02:13.233 --> 02:15.768
"I will be the Lord Protector."

02:15.768 --> 02:20.707
It doesn't mean he's the king but
he is in charge of decision-making.

02:23.676 --> 02:26.513
But there comes a time
when Dickie III says,

02:26.513 --> 02:28.882
"Oh, listen,
I'm the head honcho there."

02:28.882 --> 02:31.451
"I'm the Alan Sugar
of this operation."

02:31.451 --> 02:34.120
"These little dweebs
are gonna get the power."

02:34.120 --> 02:36.356
"And look at them.
They don't do shit."

02:36.356 --> 02:39.092
"They just play cup ball
all the time." (laughs)

02:39.092 --> 02:41.294
Whatever they do in medieval times.

02:41.294 --> 02:45.365
So Dickie 3, he makes...
he makes a move for power.

02:46.866 --> 02:48.835
"I'm... I-I'm gonna be the king."

02:48.835 --> 02:51.671
So he goes, "Oi, Eddie V,
Richard of Shrewsbury,

02:51.671 --> 02:54.107
I've got a place for you to stay.
It's plush."

02:54.107 --> 02:58.278
"It's called the Tower of London.
Now, I know what you're thinking,

02:58.278 --> 03:01.681
you're thinking that normally
people get put in prison there

03:01.681 --> 03:04.684
and get killed. For you guys, nah."

03:04.684 --> 03:09.289
"I sorted you the finest medieval
toys, you can have medieval yoyos,

03:09.289 --> 03:11.824
medieval PlayStation,
whatever that is."

03:11.824 --> 03:14.527
Sticks, innit? I dunno.
What did they have?

03:14.527 --> 03:16.396
Really nice, really nice sticks.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.165
"You're gonna have
the time of your lives."

03:19.165 --> 03:22.969
So the two princes are in the Tower,
having a great time.

03:22.969 --> 03:25.505
Then after a while
the two little princes...

03:25.505 --> 03:27.907
Ooh, people, they stopped seeing 'em.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.944
Where they gone? Who knows?
Oh, I tell you what I think.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.346
Dickie III done murked 'em.

03:33.346 --> 03:35.682
(gurgles)

03:35.682 --> 03:38.084
(gurgles)

03:42.956 --> 03:48.227
Dickie III becomes the king
on the 6th July 1483.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.463
Big day for him.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.433
All the noblemen of Britain are
like,

03:53.433 --> 03:56.736
"Where's those two princes
who are entitled to the throne?"

03:56.736 --> 04:01.007
Richard III's like, "Oh, they're
busy. You'll never see 'em again."

04:01.007 --> 04:03.710
So all the noblemen
of the country, they're like,

04:03.710 --> 04:07.046
"Dickie III, you can't do this.
Show us the princes."

04:08.247 --> 04:12.251
So Dickie III's like, "Oh, sorry,
have you got a problem with that?"

04:12.251 --> 04:15.388
"Cos I think you're forgetting
I got 20,000 men."

04:15.388 --> 04:18.757
"I'll chop your fingers off
if you give it any more of that."

04:18.757 --> 04:22.495
"You wanna talk? You wanna... You
wanna talk to my asshole, bitches!"

04:24.864 --> 04:29.068
So obviously there is resentment.
All the noblemen are like,

04:29.068 --> 04:32.839
"Did you hear Dickie III?
He told us to talk to his asshole."

04:32.839 --> 04:34.474
"That ain't cool."

04:34.474 --> 04:39.345
So the lords of England
gather around and they say,

04:39.345 --> 04:42.248
"This Richard is pretty shit."

04:42.248 --> 04:47.053
"He's clearly killed those two
little princes whose only crimes

04:47.053 --> 04:49.288
were being related to Edward IV,

04:49.288 --> 04:51.891
having no pubes
and loving Panini stickers."

04:52.892 --> 04:58.464
"We are gonna avenge their deaths
and take England back to the people

04:58.464 --> 05:01.968
by backing your boy, Henry Tudor."

05:01.968 --> 05:05.304
So Tudor unites Britain and goes,

05:05.304 --> 05:09.676
"Dickie 3, that is fucking
straight-up bellend behaviour."

05:09.676 --> 05:13.479
"Let's have a war." (laughter)

05:16.649 --> 05:19.485
So, Henry and Richard, head to head.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.722
This is fucking revolution.
England going,

05:22.722 --> 05:25.992
"Bullshit behaviour, Dickie III.
Don't kill princes."

05:25.992 --> 05:29.562
Dickie III going, "I don't give
a fuck. I'm the king of England."

05:29.562 --> 05:30.763
"I do what I want."

05:30.763 --> 05:36.469
So the battle of Bosworth Field
kicked off on 22nd August 1485.

05:47.280 --> 05:50.083
The battle was going on,
for the future of England.

05:50.950 --> 05:54.353
However, on the sidelines
you've got this cheeky little cat

05:54.353 --> 05:56.889
called the Lord Stanley of Cheshire,
right?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.759
This guy's a weird old boy.

05:59.759 --> 06:04.931
He's just sat there with like, 4,000
soldiers, but he's just chilling.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.232
He's sitting on a fence

06:06.232 --> 06:09.569
cos he's loyal to
the king of England, Richard III,

06:09.569 --> 06:13.206
but he also... he fancies
a cheeky outside bet of Henry Tudor.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.874
All of Lord Cheshire's boys,

06:14.874 --> 06:17.510
they're on the sidelines
of the war, like,

06:17.510 --> 06:21.881
"Oh, mate, give us a war!
I'd love to do some war now."

06:21.881 --> 06:26.853
"You-You-You told me there'd be
some war and I-I'm not doing war."

06:26.853 --> 06:30.757
"I'm just watching war. I'm-I'm
like a spectator to this shit."

06:30.757 --> 06:33.392
"It's like fucking SeaWorld
or something."

06:33.392 --> 06:36.395
"I wanna get involved.
I wanna kill some men."

06:36.395 --> 06:38.664
He's just like, "Ah, chill, boys."

06:39.732 --> 06:42.769
"Just chill until it becomes obvious
who the winner is."

06:43.803 --> 06:45.204
Rou-Round seven.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.809
Dickie III,
he's bleeding under the eye.

06:49.809 --> 06:53.012
Henry Tudor is, let's face it,
gonna win the war.

06:53.012 --> 06:54.413
Look what happens then.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.116
I'll ask you, what happens then,
Drunk History?

06:57.116 --> 06:59.952
That little prick,
Lord Stanley of Cheshire,

06:59.952 --> 07:02.755
who didn't wanna nail his colours
to the mask, goes,

07:02.755 --> 07:06.225
"Oh, by the way,
I'm backing Henry T right now."

07:06.225 --> 07:09.128
"Yeah, I know I didn't wanna say
I liked him before,

07:09.128 --> 07:10.997
but I do. He's my favourite team."

07:13.966 --> 07:15.434
Dickie III is done!

07:16.469 --> 07:18.838
One of Dickie III's little servants
goes,

07:18.838 --> 07:22.475
"Oi, Dickie III, mate, do you want
a horse to fuck off out of here?"

07:22.475 --> 07:23.943
"Cos you are done, mate."

07:23.943 --> 07:28.815
And he goes, "Fuck that horse.
I don't wanna horse out of here."

07:28.815 --> 07:32.385
"I wanna...
I wanna charge at Henry Tudor."

07:32.385 --> 07:36.355
(belches) "I wanna give him
a piece of my mind."

07:36.355 --> 07:39.425
So Dickie, Dickie III
says this quote, he goes,

07:39.425 --> 07:42.595
"I will either die or be a king."

07:43.930 --> 07:45.731
That's... (man shouts)
What?

07:45.731 --> 07:47.266
(crew member) Try again.

07:47.266 --> 07:50.670
"I will either king or be a die."
(man) No!

07:50.670 --> 07:55.675
You don't tell me no. You're the no.
I will either king or be a die.

07:58.544 --> 08:01.047
So Richar... D-Dickie III says,

08:01.047 --> 08:04.350
"I will either die as a king
or win."

08:06.085 --> 08:08.554
So he bangs his old little crown on.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.757
And he's charged at him...

08:13.092 --> 08:14.927
(yells)

08:14.927 --> 08:17.597
(squelching)
...and he's died immediately.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.831
(sniggers)

08:23.436 --> 08:26.672
It's... Ha-ha, ha! He's just died.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.275
He died immediately!
He had no chance!

08:29.275 --> 08:30.409
(laughs)

08:30.409 --> 08:31.477
He... (laughs)

08:32.544 --> 08:35.815
He was so outnumbered he... (laughs)

08:35.815 --> 08:38.583
War ends. Tudor's the victor.

08:38.583 --> 08:42.288
To Henry T. What a fine war he did.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.626
(coughs) Oh!

08:48.194 --> 08:49.495
(groans)

08:49.495 --> 08:53.165
Who gets to put the crown
on Henry T's head?

08:53.165 --> 08:56.168
None other than
the Slick Rick wise guy,

08:56.168 --> 08:59.705
little pussyhole who couldn't
nail his colours to the mast,

08:59.705 --> 09:01.974
Lord Stanley of Cheshire.

09:01.974 --> 09:06.245
Lord Stanley approached Henry Tudor
and went,

09:06.245 --> 09:10.283
"Listen, boy that was some proper
top warring you just did."

09:10.283 --> 09:13.519
"You totally out-warred that dick,
Dickie III."

09:13.519 --> 09:16.455
"Sorry for not supporting you
a little bit earlier."

09:16.455 --> 09:18.624
"I am at nature a coward."

09:20.092 --> 09:24.664
And Henry T goes, "Are you serious,
mate? Are you taking the piss?"

09:24.664 --> 09:28.434
"Cos, like, literally, like 20
minutes ago, you were being a pussy,

09:28.434 --> 09:30.369
and not even backing me up."

09:30.369 --> 09:32.104
"Oh, I'm sorry, sir."

09:32.104 --> 09:34.840
"Shut up, mate.
Seriously, shut your mouth."

09:34.840 --> 09:37.076
"You had 4,000 men, mate."

09:37.076 --> 09:41.013
"You could have literally
sorted this out early doors."

09:41.013 --> 09:43.082
"My mate Gary, he's dead now."

09:43.082 --> 09:45.685
"He's dead.
But thanks for the crown."

09:45.685 --> 09:47.987
"Seriously, it looks pretty good
on me."

09:47.987 --> 09:51.691
"And I'm gonna make you...
Lord Cheshire of Stanley."

09:51.691 --> 09:54.794
"That's what I was anyway."
"Well, you're staying as it."

09:58.230 --> 10:00.933
I don't know what happened.
I'm quite drunk now.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.201
Can I have some water?

10:02.201 --> 10:04.870
Yeah, let's get you some water.
I've lost it.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.174
You haven't. You're there.
You're good, you're doing well.

10:08.174 --> 10:09.508
(laughs)

10:09.508 --> 10:11.444
I've lost it. What is this, water?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.446
Yeah, yeah. Here, here.

10:14.647 --> 10:17.650
Cheers, mate.
I've lost it. I'm... I'm fucked.

10:18.651 --> 10:20.720
Do you want a bit of fresh air?

10:22.588 --> 10:24.423
(thudding)
Ow.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.629
(retching)

10:32.565 --> 10:34.567
(retching)

10:35.568 --> 10:37.636
(retching)

10:39.005 --> 10:42.708
The good news is those two little
princes were eventually found.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.244
Albeit 200 years later. In a coffin.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.881
Time for a break.
We'll be back after the ads

10:48.881 --> 10:50.649
for 19th-century incest.

10:50.649 --> 10:53.686
Yeah, I fucked my sister.
I'm a bit scandalous.

10:53.686 --> 10:55.087
You can't handle this.

10:57.990 --> 10:58.190
.

11:00.726 --> 11:00.926
.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.965
Welcome back to Drunk History,
the show that brings history to life

11:05.965 --> 11:08.768
by pouring eight pints of Stella
down its neck.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.837
(squelching)
(gargles)

11:11.837 --> 11:15.207
Now Jessica Knappett tells us
about Frankenstein,

11:15.207 --> 11:19.211
a mixture of too much alcohol
and dead, limp, lifeless body parts.

11:19.211 --> 11:22.515
We all know that story, right, lads?
Lads?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.650
A delightfully leathered Jess had...

11:31.157 --> 11:33.692
This is the story

11:33.692 --> 11:38.664
of the most nightmarish holiday

11:38.664 --> 11:43.969
that became the most
artistically productive holiday

11:43.969 --> 11:48.974
in history, thanks to...
a teenage girl.

11:50.609 --> 11:52.278
It's 1816.

11:52.278 --> 11:56.849
Lord George Byron,
he's a very famous poet.

11:56.849 --> 11:58.317
Don't you know him?

11:58.317 --> 12:03.589
And he was suffering from infamy.

12:03.589 --> 12:07.827
Basically Lord George Byron
had fucked his sister.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.030
OK?

12:12.264 --> 12:17.236
Everyone said, "Lord George Byron,
get out of town."

12:17.236 --> 12:19.438
"No, we don't mean that
figuratively."

12:19.438 --> 12:25.478
"We mean, get out of town.
You fucked your sister."

12:25.478 --> 12:30.916
Lord George Byron goes,
"Half-sister, by the way."

12:30.916 --> 12:35.488
"OK, I'm a bit scandalous.
You can't handle this."

12:35.488 --> 12:36.989
"Yeah, I fucked my sister,

12:36.989 --> 12:40.993
but in years to come
you'll be studying me at GCSE."

12:41.827 --> 12:43.028
(blows raspberry)

12:44.930 --> 12:46.065
(titters)

12:47.433 --> 12:52.438
So Byron decided to flee England
and he's like,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.908
"Hang on a minute, I've gotta go
to the doctor and get my jabs."

12:55.908 --> 12:58.310
So Byron goes to see his doctor.

12:58.310 --> 13:03.015
He's called John William Polidori.

13:04.717 --> 13:08.120
Byron's like, "I'm going on holiday,
doc. I need my jabs."

13:08.120 --> 13:10.656
The doctor's like,
"Cool. I'll sort you out."

13:10.656 --> 13:14.793
"Hepatitis A, B, C, D, F G,"

13:14.793 --> 13:19.798
and he's like, "So, doc,
what you up to this weekend?"

13:19.798 --> 13:23.369
And the doctor goes,
"I dunno. Working."

13:23.369 --> 13:28.073
Byron goes, "Fuck work.
Come on holiday with me."

13:28.073 --> 13:33.245
And the doctor's like,
"Get in! I fucking love my life!"

13:33.245 --> 13:37.483
(laughs) Byron goes,
"Wanna bring some drugs, mate?

13:37.483 --> 13:40.085
"Some of them prescription ones
what you got?

13:40.085 --> 13:43.656
"Laudanum, which is
a liquefied form of opium."

13:43.656 --> 13:47.726
Polidor's like, "Where we going?"
Byron's like, "Geneva."

13:47.726 --> 13:49.795
Doctor goes, "All right."

13:49.795 --> 13:53.532
"Doesn't sound like the greatest
holiday vacation of my life,

13:53.532 --> 13:56.669
but the laudanum
should see to that."

13:56.669 --> 13:57.870
(laughs)

13:59.905 --> 14:04.443
So off they fuck.
They're on their way.

14:04.443 --> 14:07.479
"Lads, lads, lads,

14:07.479 --> 14:10.983
I do not know my doctor well enough
to invite him on holiday."

14:12.451 --> 14:17.823
Meanwhile, Percy Shelley,
another celebrated poet,

14:17.823 --> 14:23.295
he's married but he's got this lover,
Mary. Mary Godwin.

14:23.295 --> 14:26.232
She's what, 16?

14:26.232 --> 14:30.236
He's saying to Mary, "All right.
We need to spend some time together,

14:30.236 --> 14:35.074
away from the wife."
Mary's like, "We do, Percy, yeah."

14:35.074 --> 14:37.209
"Percy, what's your point?"

14:37.209 --> 14:39.878
Percy's like,
"I wanna take you on holiday."

14:39.878 --> 14:43.916
Mary's like,
"I am bang up for a holiday, Percy."

14:43.916 --> 14:48.687
"What I want out of this holiday,
Perce, is fish bowls,

14:48.687 --> 14:52.891
I want karaoke,
I want wet t-shirt competitions."

14:52.891 --> 14:57.296
Percy's like,
"Yeah, we can make all that happen,"

14:57.296 --> 15:03.168
thinking,
"No! It's just a villa in Geneva."

15:03.168 --> 15:07.273
"It's going to be shit!"

15:07.273 --> 15:11.610
So they all arrive
at the villas in Geneva.

15:12.611 --> 15:16.882
Mary's like,
"Oh, Geneva looks good(!) Urgh!"

15:16.882 --> 15:22.454
"In the future,
this is where people will go to die."

15:22.454 --> 15:26.959
Percy's like, "Come on, Mary,
it's not all bad."

15:26.959 --> 15:30.129
"Look at the beautiful view
and look..."

15:30.129 --> 15:33.966
"Hang on a minute, who's
this character coming up the drive?"

15:34.933 --> 15:39.705
"Oh, my God! I think that might be

15:39.705 --> 15:43.776
L... L... Lord George Byron."

15:43.776 --> 15:46.679
Mary's like, "Is he the guy
who fucks his sister?"

15:46.679 --> 15:49.281
Percy's like, "Half-sister."

15:50.282 --> 15:53.585
So Percy and Mary,
they knock on the next door villa.

15:53.585 --> 15:58.557
"Byron, it's me, Perce!"
"Come in, come in, come in."

15:58.557 --> 16:00.292
(yawns)

16:01.393 --> 16:06.832
Polidor's sitting in the corner.
He's got an array of drugs around.

16:06.832 --> 16:11.403
Powders, potions, he's got
two joints coming out of his nose!

16:11.403 --> 16:15.908
He's wearing a helmet that
says on it "Good Times."

16:20.145 --> 16:23.048
He's off his box!

16:23.048 --> 16:25.651
He's off... He's off his tits.

16:25.651 --> 16:31.190
He's in the corner going,
"This is what I trained for."

16:32.291 --> 16:33.926
(laughs)

16:33.926 --> 16:37.963
Mary's like, "Get in, my friend."

16:37.963 --> 16:40.432
"I wanna be mates with that guy."

16:40.432 --> 16:42.067
So... hang on.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.269
How are you feeling, by the way?

16:44.269 --> 16:47.806
I feel like I should be wearing
a helmet saying "Good Times".

16:47.806 --> 16:48.841
(laughs)

16:49.842 --> 16:53.545
So, one night,
everyone's off their tits.

16:53.545 --> 16:57.850
Lord George Byron is telling them
all a ghost story.

16:57.850 --> 17:00.886
Byron's like...
(wails in a ghostly manner)

17:04.890 --> 17:09.294
All of a sudden, Shelley puts
his hands over his face and screams.

17:11.630 --> 17:15.000
Mary's like, "What the fuck
is happening to my boyfriend?"

17:15.000 --> 17:18.904
And they chuck a load of water
on him. He's like... pfft.

17:18.904 --> 17:20.439
"I'm sorry."

17:20.439 --> 17:26.078
"I thought I saw a woman
with eyes for tits."

17:26.078 --> 17:31.650
Mary's like,
"You fucking lightweight."

17:31.650 --> 17:35.788
So, basically, Percy's been spooked,

17:35.788 --> 17:38.991
but he cracks on.
They get back into the party vibe.

17:38.991 --> 17:42.628
Byron's like,
"All right, OK, here's my idea

17:42.628 --> 17:47.199
of how we're gonna make this party
the best party it can possibly be."

17:47.199 --> 17:52.805
"You're gonna absolutely
love this game."

17:53.806 --> 17:58.310
"We... all... write..."

17:58.310 --> 18:00.946
"...a... book."

18:00.946 --> 18:03.248
(laughs)

18:06.251 --> 18:10.789
And Mary Shelley's like,
"Oh, for fuck's sake."

18:10.789 --> 18:15.828
"Have I actually gotta write a book
on holiday?"

18:15.828 --> 18:19.264
"This is, like, worse than school."

18:19.264 --> 18:23.435
Mary's like, "Fuck my life."

18:23.435 --> 18:25.771
"I'm going to sleep."

18:25.771 --> 18:28.640
Mary goes to sleep.

18:28.640 --> 18:33.212
It's, like, stormy outside and
it's thundering and it's night-time,

18:33.212 --> 18:35.614
and it's all, like, gothic.

18:35.614 --> 18:40.352
With a crack of lightning...
(imitates lightning)

18:40.352 --> 18:43.755
...Mary wakes up in the middle
of the night. (gasps)

18:43.755 --> 18:47.326
"What was that?"

18:47.326 --> 18:51.029
"I've just had a dream about
a monster

18:51.029 --> 18:53.065
with loads of different body parts

18:53.065 --> 18:56.568
and a doctor who can reassemble
the body parts,

18:56.568 --> 19:00.572
run electricity through them
and make it into another being."

19:01.573 --> 19:05.744
"Hang on a minute, that's a fucking
good idea for a story."

19:05.744 --> 19:07.546
And then she fell asleep again.

19:09.548 --> 19:14.920
The day has come for all four
of them to share their stories.

19:14.920 --> 19:19.424
"All right, story time.
Percy, shoot!"

19:19.424 --> 19:23.362
Percy's like,
"Well, once upon a time,

19:23.362 --> 19:29.001
there was a man who had a shoe."

19:29.001 --> 19:33.171
"You haven't done it." Percy's like,
"No, I'm really sorry. I haven't."

19:33.171 --> 19:38.143
Byron's like, "Thanks, Percy(!)
Polidor, what have you got?"

19:38.143 --> 19:41.113
Polidor's off his tits.
He's been up for four days.

19:42.114 --> 19:44.583
"Eggs." (laughs)

19:44.583 --> 19:47.753
"Mary Godwin, what have you got?"

19:47.753 --> 19:52.357
Mary's like, "Last night,
I had a bit of a mental dream

19:52.357 --> 19:55.561
and I just wrote that down.
So you can hear it, if you want."

19:57.596 --> 20:00.866
"Oh, there's a monster,
there's a load of body parts,

20:00.866 --> 20:03.669
that's been stuck together
by a doctor."

20:03.669 --> 20:06.238
They're enraptured by this story.

20:06.238 --> 20:11.410
"Then what happens, Mary? Then what
happens? Mary, then what happens?"

20:11.410 --> 20:17.215
She's like, "You wouldn't believe
the monstrosity of this story."

20:17.215 --> 20:19.685
"It's the dark tale."

20:19.685 --> 20:20.986
(laughs)

20:22.187 --> 20:25.691
Byron's like, "This
is a fucking great story, Mary."

20:25.691 --> 20:31.129
"No, more than that. This is
a better story than I could write."

20:31.129 --> 20:34.766
Mary's like, "Thanks, guys."

20:34.766 --> 20:37.603
"I mean, all right, yeah,
it's quite a good story,

20:37.603 --> 20:41.106
but I thought I was just coming here
to have a good time, but..."

20:42.474 --> 20:46.345
"I mean, maybe, yeah, maybe I did
come up with something quite good."

20:46.345 --> 20:51.249
Then Mary Godwin,
she married Percy Shelley.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.652
She went on to write...

20:54.953 --> 20:57.456
...all of that story into a book,

20:57.456 --> 21:00.759
which is what we now know
as Frankenstein.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.664
The moral of this story is,
if you go on holiday

21:05.664 --> 21:09.234
and you don't write
a best-selling book,

21:09.234 --> 21:13.572
then you've failed as a 16-year-old.

21:13.572 --> 21:14.606
(laughs)

21:17.776 --> 21:20.646
So Byron was in trouble
for fucking his sister.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.814
Didn't even know
he was from Norfolk.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.117
That's all for tonight.
See you next week

21:25.117 --> 21:27.786
for another history lesson
you'll never forget,

21:27.786 --> 21:30.555
and our comedians
will never remember. Goodnight.
