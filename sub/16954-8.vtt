{\an1}- We need one
with a seatbelt.

37:48.065 --> 37:49.467
{\an3}- Yeah.

37:51.435 --> 37:52.670
- She found
her way out.

37:52.737 --> 37:53.938
Just let her, she'll learn.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.706
She'll learn.
- Have three kids, they said.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.874
{\an3}It'll be fun,
they said.

37:56.941 --> 37:58.342
{\an1}- Yeah.

37:58.409 --> 37:59.877
- [baby crying]

38:07.084 --> 38:08.886
{\an3}- [sighs]

38:10.755 --> 38:12.890
- Ready for the big game?

38:12.957 --> 38:14.692
- Yeah.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.827
District championship.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.496
- If they'll win,
it will be back to back.

38:18.562 --> 38:20.431
- Yup.

38:20.498 --> 38:21.699
That'd be fun.

38:21.766 --> 38:23.634
- Well, I texted Ryan
to let him know

38:23.701 --> 38:25.436
but I haven't heard back.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.971
This is the biggest game.

38:27.038 --> 38:28.039
- Right.

38:28.105 --> 38:29.440
- Of the year.

38:29.507 --> 38:31.709
- But you haven't heard
from him at all?

38:31.776 --> 38:32.977
- No, I've not heard from him.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.380
I have not spoken
to him in weeks,

38:36.447 --> 38:39.784
so he hasn't seen
or met Maverick yet.

38:42.053 --> 38:45.056
{\an3}- This doesn't make
any sense.

38:45.122 --> 38:47.725
- It'll never make
any sense with him.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.529
{\an1}I love
watching Bentley

38:51.595 --> 38:52.997
{\an1}do what he
loves to do.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.366
Sat in a hundred
degree weather,

38:55.433 --> 38:56.934
pregnant as can be,

38:57.001 --> 38:59.670
and still showed up
to every single game.

38:59.737 --> 39:02.073
{\an1}And now I'm still
doing it

39:02.139 --> 39:03.607
with a one-year-old

39:03.674 --> 39:05.409
and a newborn, like,

39:05.476 --> 39:07.478
I don't understand.
Is there something wrong?

39:07.545 --> 39:09.080
Like, is there some sort of,

39:09.146 --> 39:11.949
{\an1}like, chemical
imbalance for him

39:12.016 --> 39:15.619
{\an1}to not feel
the same way?

39:15.686 --> 39:17.488
I don't know.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.557
But I'm no longer

39:19.623 --> 39:22.560
gonna force him to or...

39:22.626 --> 39:23.761
- Oh, I understand.

39:23.828 --> 39:25.463
I love seeing him play.
- Right.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.832
It's like, what else
are you doing?

39:27.898 --> 39:29.834
You have one child,

39:29.900 --> 39:33.037
you don't have a job.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.773
If he wanted to be there,
he'd be there.
