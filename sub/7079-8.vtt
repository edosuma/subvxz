WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:04.254
At 60% less fat
and 20% less price,

00:04.546 --> 00:07.883
the only thing Kolb Family's
Family Pack Ham Packs

00:08.175 --> 00:10.344
don't have less of is flavor.

00:10.636 --> 00:12.638
Ham, girl!

00:12.930 --> 00:14.806
Family Pack Ham
Packs from Kolb Family Farms,

00:15.098 --> 00:16.658
the family that's pleased
to "meat" you.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.228
Ham, girl!

00:19.520 --> 00:21.480
You don't know his name,
but you know what he says

00:21.730 --> 00:23.565
and you love how he says it.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.025
Ham, girl!

00:25.317 --> 00:27.361
Ham, girl!

00:31.240 --> 00:33.909
So, who is the man
who started it all?

00:34.201 --> 00:37.079
Ben Chang, and we have him
here with us today.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.039
You are the "ham, girl!" guy.

00:40.457 --> 00:42.000
Yes, I am the "ham, girl" guy.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.418
How did this happen?

00:43.710 --> 00:46.547
Well, I just kept auditioning,
you know, kept working hard.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.257
And now, Spielberg is calling.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.342
Not...

00:50.634 --> 00:54.096
You know, I don't go by phone calls.
I go by contracts.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.348
But Spielberg is
interested in you

00:56.640 --> 00:59.268
for The Color Blue
in the new Play-Doh movie.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.353
Is that right?
Well, maybe, you know, maybe,

01:01.645 --> 01:04.565
but like I always say, you know,

01:04.855 --> 01:06.233
life is a roller coaster.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.111
You were a teacher at a
community college in Colorado.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.029
Did you just,
one day in class, say,

01:11.321 --> 01:13.001
"Class dismissed.
I'm headed to Hollywood"?

01:13.240 --> 01:15.659
I mean, how did your
students react to that?

01:15.951 --> 01:17.995
Well, you know, I haven't
spoken to them really.

01:18.287 --> 01:21.164
I... there's not much
for me back there.

01:21.456 --> 01:22.456
No friends?

01:22.708 --> 01:24.501
Uh, you know,
I was kind of a loner.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.938
People, you know,
made fun of me for it,

01:28.088 --> 01:29.798
but, you know,
I just kept my head down

01:30.090 --> 01:31.290
and stayed focused on my work.

01:31.550 --> 01:33.885
Well, they're not making
fun of you now, are they?

01:34.177 --> 01:35.177
No, they are not.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.429
Can I get a "ham, girl"?

01:36.638 --> 01:39.433
Ham, girl!

01:39.725 --> 01:41.202
You know, I don't know
if that was a good one.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.562
And there it is,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:43.854 --> 01:47.149
From community college to
something a little bit better.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.151
Turn it off. Ben Chang
is on a rocketship

01:49.443 --> 01:50.902
to eternal validation.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.446
Turn it off.

01:52.738 --> 01:54.364
Thanks so much for...

01:57.492 --> 02:00.078
Well, it's been three weeks.
I'm having his car towed.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.833
♪ Give me some rope
Tie me to dream

02:05.125 --> 02:08.169
♪ Give me the hope
to run out of steam

02:08.461 --> 02:11.465
♪ Somebody said it can be here

02:11.757 --> 02:15.594
♪ We could be roped up,
tied up, dead in a year

02:15.886 --> 02:20.474
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay

02:20.766 --> 02:24.561
♪ One by one they all
just fade away ♪

02:32.903 --> 02:33.987
Here you go.

02:34.279 --> 02:36.156
To Chang.
May your success be brief

02:36.448 --> 02:37.528
and your colds last months.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.992
Jeff.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.444
Hey, you get out of Greendale

02:40.577 --> 02:41.929
or you get me in your corner.
You don't get both.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.121
Ham, girl. Mmm.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.457
Who would've predicted
Chang becoming famous?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.167
Technically, I did, remember?

02:47.459 --> 02:49.270
- Only I thought it would be for...
- Eating someone.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.921
Yeah.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.690
You think that Spielberg
stuff is really happening?

02:52.714 --> 02:53.840
How could that happen?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.593
That would mean
the world was insane.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.138
Ham, girl.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.641
Not to be crass, but there
is an upside to this,

03:02.933 --> 03:03.933
financially.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.396
Chang's absence lowers
our insurance premiums 6%.

03:07.688 --> 03:10.482
There's nothing
but upsides to him leaving.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.627
I think we all just feel
a little short-changed.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.362
We invested so much in him
when no one else would.

03:15.654 --> 03:17.197
Because we all assumed
he was so insane

03:17.489 --> 03:19.157
he would die
if we kicked him out.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.201
And this whole time,
it turns out

03:21.493 --> 03:24.746
we were holding him back.
We thought he was bedrock,

03:25.038 --> 03:26.665
but it turns out
he was the ceiling

03:26.957 --> 03:28.291
of a cavern filled with us.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.502
I've already forgotten his name.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.338
Did you ever really
know his name?

03:33.630 --> 03:34.756
The Chinese fellow, right?

03:35.048 --> 03:36.466
Whose name was
some kind of noise?

03:36.758 --> 03:37.843
Um, Clang? Blang? Meringue?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.255
Looks like I'm the only one
that's not glad he's gone.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.156
At least I can finally clear
some space on my hard drive.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.740
Oh, Leonard's been in there
for a while,

03:43.974 --> 03:47.310
but I can stand guard if you
want to use the women's room.

03:47.602 --> 03:49.163
No, I mean, I was shooting
a movie with Chang

03:49.187 --> 03:50.814
before he booked
"ham, girl." Oh.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.443
I haven't heard from since, so I
assume the footage is useless.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.778
Did he sign a release form?
Sure.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.006
I make all my actors sign
releases before we do anything.

03:59.030 --> 04:01.074
You never know
who is going to...

04:01.366 --> 04:04.661
The school owns a movie
starring the "ham, girl" guy.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.205
Soon to be Spielberg's
"ham, girl" guy.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.101
There's no way
to finish it though.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.252
Okay, Abed, what have I
told you about quitting?

04:12.544 --> 04:14.264
That it's sometimes
the only way to survive.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.173
Well...

04:16.464 --> 04:18.550
Don't forget I said "sometimes."

04:19.760 --> 04:22.095
Yolanda, the mayor's up my ass.

04:22.387 --> 04:25.098
I want justice. Get him in here!

04:27.726 --> 04:29.352
Is that right?
Should I be angry?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.964
The film's hero
is Police Justice.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.957
I had a real-life former cop
help me with the dialog.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.316
I'm gonna punch you
in the heart!

04:34.608 --> 04:36.448
Real-life former cops
aren't great with dialog.

04:36.568 --> 04:38.153
I don't think police
should be heroes.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.988
Britta, pay your rent.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.115
Sorry, Abed. Okay,
I need more information.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.647
You know, what's my motivation?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.119
Am I married?
I need more to go on.

04:46.411 --> 04:48.121
- Can we get lunch?
- Okay, cut.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.057
That's about all we got. Chang
found out the McRib was back

04:50.081 --> 04:51.225
and we lost the rest of the day.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.876
Great actor, huge McRib problem.

04:53.168 --> 04:54.836
Everybody,

04:55.128 --> 04:58.215
this is my friend
I told you about, Maury.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.509
He's a genuine Hollywood
film producer

05:00.801 --> 05:02.320
whose doctor ordered him
to live in Colorado

05:02.344 --> 05:04.504
due to a medical condition.
Tell them what you told me.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.407
Yeah, my blood nitrogen
levels are through the roof.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.551
Most of the time, I ca...
Oh, no, no, the other thing.

05:08.600 --> 05:09.600
Oh, right.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.520
If you can cut together
an 81 minute movie

05:11.812 --> 05:13.563
that arguably stars
the "ham, girl" guy,

05:13.855 --> 05:16.055
I can guarantee distribution
and a fast turnaround deal.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.818
People do it all the time
with old footage

05:18.109 --> 05:19.229
from recently famous actors.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.531
Have you seen Vin Diesel
in 1996's Happy Pants?

05:22.823 --> 05:23.865
No. Yeah, I have.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.700
Well, neither has Vin Diesel,

05:25.992 --> 05:28.662
but his roommate from film
school saw 500 grand.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.831
But I can't just
burn up my cop drama.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.934
It's my only chance at the
mainstream success I need

05:32.958 --> 05:34.769
before I'm allowed to make
weird stuff for money.

05:34.793 --> 05:36.353
It's my American Graffiti,
my Alpha Man,

05:36.378 --> 05:38.064
my Four Rooms,
the Robert Rodriguez segment.

05:38.088 --> 05:40.173
Well, why does it have to be
a police movie?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.785
People don't even like
police now.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.447
They like dinosaurs,
they like aliens,

05:43.718 --> 05:45.971
and anything else that Chris
Pratt can join forces with.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.074
I have three minutes of
footage, and he's clearly

05:48.098 --> 05:49.575
a police chief
behind a desk in New York.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.679
Is he? Or is it Space York?

05:50.809 --> 05:51.810
Or is it a dinosaur desk?

05:52.102 --> 05:53.895
How do I know? Just add some CG.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.939
That's what they do
with Chris Pratt.

05:56.231 --> 05:59.025
They put him in a regular scene
and then they add some gagoos.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.570
I have a few CG models
of some gagoos.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.655
I got fired
from a mouthwash commercial,

06:03.947 --> 06:05.427
but I successfully
won back the rights

06:05.532 --> 06:07.659
to my gingivitis monster.

06:07.951 --> 06:10.787
Also, I don't know if it helps,
but when I moved into my RV,

06:11.079 --> 06:12.664
I found this.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.236
Now, you notice
anything strange?

06:16.084 --> 06:17.919
There's no green 3 in billiards.

06:18.211 --> 06:20.005
Now, there's a green 6
and a green 14,

06:20.297 --> 06:21.631
but never a green 3.

06:21.923 --> 06:26.595
So, what sport is this from?
And why was it in my RV?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.893
Anyway, I can do some CG
for the movie.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.424
You'll need a Chris Pratt type.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.396
I'll do it if I have to.
I can slouch.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.207
I can't believe you guys
are the ones pitching me this

06:38.231 --> 06:39.566
and I can't believe
I'm saying no.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.359
You're not saying no.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.153
I mean, legally
I can't force you,

06:43.445 --> 06:44.905
but I can do
a morning announcement

06:45.196 --> 06:46.716
that'll make everyone
hate you forever.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.242
Technically, Abed, you would
be robbing the school

06:49.534 --> 06:51.745
for $1/2 million
by not making this movie.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.037
But what movie?

06:53.246 --> 06:54.414
Have you not been listening?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.066
The movie about
the "ham, girl" guy

06:56.249 --> 06:58.335
in his space office
fighting some gagoos

06:58.627 --> 06:59.711
led by a Chris Pratt type

07:00.003 --> 07:01.796
played by Jeffery
without his shirt.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.173
It shoots this weekend.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.883
Yeah.

07:05.175 --> 07:07.385
Okay, but I get final cut
and it has to be a good movie.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.638
Agreed, but you have to
finish that cut by Monday,

07:09.930 --> 07:11.157
even if it's bad.
I agree to that,

07:11.181 --> 07:12.491
but it has to be good
by my standards.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.184
Absolutely, and also,
if it's terrible,

07:14.476 --> 07:15.769
nobody will notice or care.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.330
And you guys are all
gonna help me?

07:17.354 --> 07:18.674
And we're gonna
make a good movie?

07:18.897 --> 07:20.657
Definitely, or a bad one.
Probably a bad one.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.259
I think we're all
on the same page.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.027
I guess so.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.155
So, let's crap out
this piece of crap.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.573
That attitude concerns me.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.749
I need more information.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.838
What's my motivation?

07:45.000 --> 07:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:54.349 --> 07:56.142
I need more to go on.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.687
My name is Chief-Starr!

07:58.979 --> 08:01.189
And I'm in the stars!

08:01.481 --> 08:03.024
And I'm the hero.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.986
I deserve better.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.697
You're a very gifted pilot,
Chief Starr.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.494
I'm the Mayor of Outer Space.
Why are we changing course?

08:14.786 --> 08:15.786
The Mayor's up my ass!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.914
Father, I love him!

08:21.710 --> 08:23.044
What in the space?

08:23.336 --> 08:25.880
Yooba dooba dooba!
We're under attack!

08:26.172 --> 08:27.549
By whom, GlipGlop?

08:28.216 --> 08:29.217
Okay, cut.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.509
Why are we cutting?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.345
Well, that felt good to me.
Moving on?

08:32.636 --> 08:33.679
Just a couple adjustments.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.472
You get two.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.284
You guys need to move
when the ship gets hit.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.707
It looks weird
when you stand still,

08:38.977 --> 08:40.371
and, Britta, it sounds weird
when you use good grammar.

08:40.395 --> 08:41.835
My character
can't have good grammar?

08:42.105 --> 08:43.273
Not in a space battle.

08:43.565 --> 08:45.459
Because everything else we're
saying sounds really natural,

08:45.483 --> 08:47.027
like I'm a space senator.
Space Mayor.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.130
I'm matching your dialog
to what I have from Chang.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.321
What are my lines?

08:50.613 --> 08:51.674
You don't have any lines.
You're the backup Chang.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.866
But we have Chang's footage.

08:53.158 --> 08:54.468
This shot from that angle
matches the back

08:54.492 --> 08:55.886
of Chang's shot.
Chang is Chief Starr.

08:55.910 --> 08:56.971
He's the pilot of a spaceship.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.222
Britta,
you're Princess Meridian.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.664
Brittana.
Okay. Jeff is her father,

08:59.956 --> 09:01.767
the Mayor of Space,
and you guys are under attack.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.791
Action.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.296
What in the space?

09:06.588 --> 09:09.424
Yooba dooba dooba!
We're under attack!

09:09.716 --> 09:11.509
Okay, cut. Where you
guys seeing GlipGlop?

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
You said GlipGlop
was a tennis ball.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.637
But Garrett's not GlipGlop?

09:14.929 --> 09:16.681
If I was GlipGlop,
why would I be holding

09:16.973 --> 09:18.141
a tennis ball on a stick?

09:18.433 --> 09:19.476
Why am I wearing a blouse?

09:19.768 --> 09:21.008
It's sci-fi. It doesn't matter.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.563
Please don't say that.
I know you don't mean that.

09:23.855 --> 09:24.935
The tennis ball is GlipGlop

09:25.023 --> 09:26.733
and please stumble
in the same direction.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.068
Go! Action! Bang!

09:29.778 --> 09:31.488
What in space?

09:31.780 --> 09:33.907
Gooba Gooba Gooba!
We're under attack!

09:34.199 --> 09:37.911
Who by? Who attack? Me princess.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.370
The Sporborfians!

09:44.375 --> 09:45.710
Okay.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.378
I'm ready. Are you ready?

09:50.465 --> 09:51.966
Are we rolling?

09:53.468 --> 09:54.468
Are we rolling?

09:54.636 --> 09:55.762
We're rolling-a!

10:05.438 --> 10:07.440
Get to the escape pods.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.150
For real?
You picked that outfit?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.962
Britta! I...
It's Meridian. Keep going.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.363
Insane. And what is your name,

10:13.655 --> 10:16.616
Exploitia? Scorpio Nine.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.493
I'm a pleasure droid.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.620
No. I'm an assassin?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.807
You're both. Keep going.
She was a pleasure droid.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.725
She got turned into an assassin.
She's my other daughter.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.959
That's your sister.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.378
Get to the escape pods!

10:28.670 --> 10:30.505
And then we go! This way.

10:32.423 --> 10:34.008
Check on Chief Starr, Jeff.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.803
Chief Starr? What?

10:37.095 --> 10:38.555
I'll see you in hell.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.181
What?

10:40.473 --> 10:42.767
Mayor, your ass is grass!

10:43.852 --> 10:45.311
Okay, cut.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.961
There are some things
that we could...

10:51.985 --> 10:53.278
Okay, moving on, people!

10:56.197 --> 10:57.365
Okay, moving on!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.659
Next shot...
Space station faculty lounge.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.536
- Thank you.
- Abed,

11:01.828 --> 11:03.428
we need to move
a little faster, I think.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.099
Can I just explain something
as a filmmaker?

11:05.123 --> 11:06.350
I wish you wouldn't.
I wish you would look

11:06.374 --> 11:07.768
at what I was wearing
and let that be

11:07.792 --> 11:09.377
all the explanation you need

11:09.669 --> 11:11.087
about where our standards
should be.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.065
But do you understand that
sci-fi films aren't usually

11:13.089 --> 11:14.090
improvised over a weekend

11:14.382 --> 11:15.967
with a cast and crew
that doesn't care?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.636
We care about finishing,

11:18.928 --> 11:20.408
and this has to be finished
by Monday,

11:20.513 --> 11:23.141
so you back into a level
of quality from there.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.810
Let me use a metaphor
I can understand.

11:26.102 --> 11:27.102
Every day, I work out.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.353
Really? Yes,

11:28.563 --> 11:29.923
because I'm not an artist
like you,

11:29.981 --> 11:32.525
but this is a kind of canvas.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.319
I work on it with equipment,

11:34.611 --> 11:37.071
but I will never really be done.
Could be if you wanted.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.324
I mean, you're fine...
This will never be done.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.096
Chris Pratt's never
gonna stop, is he?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.744
He'll always be out there
mocking me.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.996
So I can never stop, just
like you'll never stop

11:45.288 --> 11:46.581
making movies.

11:46.873 --> 11:49.792
But I don't stay on one
treadmill my entire life

11:50.084 --> 11:52.084
staring at commercials for
movies with Chris Pratt.

11:52.295 --> 11:54.380
I take my work into the world.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.424
I "premier" it.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.176
I share with the public.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.094
Don't stay in the gym, Abed.

12:00.386 --> 12:02.096
Get this session done,
get out there,

12:02.388 --> 12:03.628
and get your shirt off. Got it?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.433
Yes?

12:05.725 --> 12:06.725
Yes.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.606
I'm ready. Let's do this.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.797
I understand you're looking
for your friend.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.258
Yeah. I'm Minotaur Man.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.927
What?
Friends are hard to come by

12:41.219 --> 12:44.013
in space.
You'd better take this...

12:45.723 --> 12:46.849
For protection.

12:50.728 --> 12:52.688
The sound you hear coming
from that gun I gave you

12:52.772 --> 12:55.733
is 40,000 hyper watts of laser.

12:57.527 --> 12:58.927
Oh, don't...
Don't worry about that.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.112
I can put that back.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.074
Sometimes my eye falls off
because I'm a robot.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.034
- Ahh!
- Watch out!

13:06.035 --> 13:07.453
Ahh!

13:18.006 --> 13:19.507
How about this bar?

13:19.799 --> 13:23.094
Everyone here is so accustomed
to violence.

13:23.386 --> 13:25.638
I need... I need to know...

13:25.930 --> 13:27.765
Where your friends are? Yeah.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.697
I'm sorry, but you're
not gonna like this.

13:29.892 --> 13:32.437
Your friends have been
taken prisoner by Master...

13:32.729 --> 13:35.440
Master... Dracula.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.702
Wild West, baby, space
version of the Wild West.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.748
Cut.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.501
Okay.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.961
My eye fell off.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.254
But I covered.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.017
Perfect, moving on. Hallway!

14:11.309 --> 14:12.518
Yes!

14:19.108 --> 14:20.151
Ooh, take that!

14:20.443 --> 14:22.153
A yooba dooba!

14:22.445 --> 14:24.447
This is crazy.

14:24.739 --> 14:26.866
Here, let me do this.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.826
What are you doing?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.399
You make everything harder for
all women when you do that.

14:31.454 --> 14:32.622
I'm improvising!

14:32.914 --> 14:34.123
Improvise pockets!

14:34.415 --> 14:36.793
Pay your rent or shut up!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.340
Laser bomb!

14:54.519 --> 14:57.230
Yooba dooba dooba!
GlipGlop like!

14:58.064 --> 14:59.399
Yooba dooba dooba.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.130
Yooba dooba dooba.
Yooba dooba dooba.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.989
So the robot
also says "Yooba dooba"?

15:08.533 --> 15:10.052
I'm not complaining.
It's just that everyone

15:10.076 --> 15:12.370
who's not a person
is saying "Yooba dooba."

15:12.662 --> 15:14.831
Maybe it's because I'm a spy!

15:15.123 --> 15:17.083
He's a spy!

15:17.375 --> 15:19.210
I'm an evil spy!

15:19.502 --> 15:20.878
Shoot GlipGlop! He's a spy!

15:21.170 --> 15:23.047
Ahh!

15:23.339 --> 15:24.590
GlipGlop's a spy?

15:24.882 --> 15:26.342
We went with it.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.220
Okay. Shot. Shot.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.014
Okay, now that...
Now that's he's dead,

15:32.306 --> 15:35.393
and there's one robot left,
let's go through the thing!

15:35.685 --> 15:36.686
Go.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.397
Yooba dooba dooba.
Yooba dooba dooba.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.190
Yooba dooba dooba.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.070
Whoa! Ahh!

15:46.362 --> 15:48.698
Argh.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.203
Space garbage.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.330
Look!

15:56.622 --> 15:58.541
Oh, we're gonna get crushed.
Ahh!

15:58.833 --> 16:00.877
And is there a monster?

16:02.462 --> 16:04.714
Ahh.

16:05.006 --> 16:06.446
But so what?
We're gonna get crushed.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.219
Uh... I love you?

16:10.511 --> 16:11.679
I love you.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.931
That's your daughter.
You're my daughter.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.392
Yeah, you said
we were sisters, dumb-ass.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.852
That's hot.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.729
It's like "Chinatown" in space.
Oh.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.485
And I'm the hero?

16:25.776 --> 16:26.944
Yay!

16:27.236 --> 16:28.236
Let's do this.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.073
Yeah! They're saved!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.996
I feel the Force.

16:37.288 --> 16:38.289
What?

16:38.581 --> 16:41.125
I don't feel the Force.
I'm not allowed to.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.211
What do I feel?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.589
I feel Dracula Force.

16:48.216 --> 16:50.092
I feel Dracula signals.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.971
Your ass is mine!

16:57.433 --> 16:59.769
That last stunt you pulled
put six of my best guys

17:00.061 --> 17:01.479
in the hospital, maniac.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.606
I'm more than a maniac.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.275
I'm Dracula.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
Jesus Chr... Jesus Christ!

17:23.291 --> 17:25.711
Oh, my God! Jesus
Christ, they shot him!

17:27.463 --> 17:28.839
Who am I?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.883
What's my motivation?

17:31.175 --> 17:34.845
Why am I doing or saying
anything I'm saying or doing?

17:35.137 --> 17:36.305
I need more...

17:36.597 --> 17:38.474
I need more
than what I'm getting.

17:56.450 --> 17:57.743
- Oh! It's incredible!
- Oh.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.315
It's incredible!
Congratulations!

17:59.495 --> 18:01.122
Oh, how long is it?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.748
Uh, 87 minutes.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.209
Get it to 8-1. That means 81.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.628
I'll make some calls,
we'll premier this thing,

18:07.920 --> 18:09.240
and we'll get your school
a check.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.423
Whoa!

18:14.594 --> 18:16.012
So, which six minutes
should we cut?

18:16.304 --> 18:17.513
Hoo. Uh...

18:17.805 --> 18:19.157
Jeff's death scene
probably, right?

18:19.181 --> 18:20.391
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.869
Mine? Yeah, in the space dungeon?
There's no Chang in that.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.353
How long is Jeff's death scene?

18:24.645 --> 18:26.939
Yeah, how long is it? We're
really zeroing in on it.

18:28.399 --> 18:30.484
Do you think I'm frightened?

18:30.776 --> 18:34.113
These chains were forged
from the iron of Ganymede.

18:40.703 --> 18:42.622
I'm not gonna tell you
where he is.

18:42.913 --> 18:45.583
I'd rather die.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.086
Mmm, seems pretty important,
he doesn't give up Chang.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.340
I mean, otherwise the last thing he
says to him is, "I'll see you in hell."

18:52.632 --> 18:53.632
Uh...

18:53.758 --> 18:56.427
It's not really
a movie about him.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.596
Yeah. Well, what about
your steel drum solo?

18:58.888 --> 19:00.806
Oh. Oh, I don't think
we should lose that.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.576
Well, what about
the weird wedding ritual

19:02.600 --> 19:03.640
on GlipGlop's planet, huh?

19:03.851 --> 19:05.394
Um, okay,

19:05.686 --> 19:07.566
let's not throw out the
baby with the bathwater.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.774
We're not cutting
a frame of GlipGlop.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.443
I mean, that's like cutting
cowboy out of "Midnight Cowboy."

19:12.735 --> 19:15.780
Jeff's death scene is
6 minutes, 30 seconds.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.512
Oh, perfect.
There you go. That's it.

19:17.698 --> 19:18.698
Okay, cool. Easy enough.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.993
Um, should we,
before we finish editing,

19:21.285 --> 19:24.080
should we get those hornets
out of the garbage?

19:24.372 --> 19:25.998
The swarming hornets?

19:26.791 --> 19:27.917
Oh!

19:31.045 --> 19:33.005
Is that serious?
Is he doing a bit?

19:34.382 --> 19:35.883
That's a long bit.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.259
Oh, he's serious.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.886
I mean, let's face it.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.572
It's pretty obvious
when he's acting.

19:40.596 --> 19:41.596
Oh...

19:45.309 --> 19:46.769
Let's do this.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.396
Yo, yo, yo. Howdy.

19:48.688 --> 19:51.065
Welcome to Kyle Beiderman's
editing tutorials.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.984
I'm Kyle Beiderman.
Yeah, that Kyle Beiderman.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.696
Leave me alone, Abed.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.240
Once I watch this tutorial
on how editing works,

19:59.532 --> 20:01.992
I'm gonna save this movie
without removing its soul.

20:03.494 --> 20:06.038
Step one, how to correctly
label your files.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.165
No, no, who cares
about labeling files?

20:08.457 --> 20:09.917
Teach me to edit.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.629
What the hell was that?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.509
You stay away.
This is my movie too!

20:18.801 --> 20:20.487
It's not even a movie, Jeff.
It's a piece of crap.

20:20.511 --> 20:21.871
That doesn't mean
it can't be good.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.431
It's basically
exactly what it means.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.725
You stay away, Abed.
I'm not kidding.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.352
I'm huge and I have
zero blood sugar.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.187
I will kill you
in these Frisbees

20:30.479 --> 20:32.690
and nobody will ever find you!

20:32.982 --> 20:35.182
Okay, so now let's get familiar
with the user interface.

20:35.443 --> 20:37.111
No! Just teach me to edit!

20:37.403 --> 20:38.487
Bazinga!

20:39.613 --> 20:40.781
Ahh!

20:42.074 --> 20:45.119
Ahh! I'm going to kill you!

20:45.411 --> 20:48.372
You're killing me! I told you!

20:48.664 --> 20:50.184
No, I mean you're
literally killing me.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.417
For real? Yes.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.301
Are you nuts?
What is wrong with you?

21:00.593 --> 21:04.096
Every single one of you is gonna
leave here except for me.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.475
Troy, Shirley,
Annie's gonna be president.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.560
Even Pierce got to die.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.854
If Chang goes to Hollywood,

21:12.146 --> 21:14.607
so we force you to make the
crappiest movie of all time,

21:14.899 --> 21:16.668
and then we force you
to make it even crappier

21:16.692 --> 21:18.378
and we watch it and it's
still not even that bad.

21:18.402 --> 21:20.529
And the part I accidentally
got the most excited about

21:20.821 --> 21:22.364
is the seven minutes we can cut.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.158
Do you know what that means?

21:24.450 --> 21:26.330
It means I'm a genius,
but we already knew that.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.912
I finally know in my heart

21:28.204 --> 21:32.041
that I will literally be
the last one of us here.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.585
And I know they gave digital
muscles to Chris Pratt

21:34.877 --> 21:36.045
in Guardians of The Galaxy.

21:36.337 --> 21:37.817
I watched Parks and Rec.
I watched it.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.566
Hmm. There's no scientific
explanation for how...

21:39.590 --> 21:40.590
Jeff.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.572
You helped me learn something
about filmmaking today

21:45.596 --> 21:47.236
that I think we all need
to apply to life.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.946
It's okay to plan some stuff
and it's okay

21:48.974 --> 21:50.392
to figure out what we did wrong,

21:50.684 --> 21:52.204
but our plans are
randomly gonna fall apart

21:52.228 --> 21:54.063
and our lessons
are randomly gonna be wrong,

21:54.355 --> 21:56.208
and if we just keep the cameras
rolling and shoot a lot of crap,

21:56.232 --> 21:58.084
eventually, Annie is going
to reach down her shirt

21:58.108 --> 21:59.151
and pull out a laser bomb.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.612
I didn't write that.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.739
We didn't plan that.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.908
God made that happen.

22:06.200 --> 22:07.827
God made this movie.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.371
And it's dumb.

22:10.663 --> 22:12.456
And we're dumb for being in it.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.042
Life is a big, dumb, pointless
movie with no story

22:15.334 --> 22:17.479
and an abrupt ending where the
hero gets shot by Dracula

22:17.503 --> 22:20.005
in the middle of a lunch
order during an outtake,

22:20.297 --> 22:22.258
but somewhere in there,
every once in a while...

22:22.550 --> 22:24.218
Annie reaches down her shirt.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.520
So we keep the cameras rolling.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.372
And we edit out the parts
we don't like,

22:36.647 --> 22:38.041
and we stop thinking
about Chris Pratt so much

22:38.065 --> 22:39.108
because it is not healthy.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.411
Will you do me a favor?

22:50.703 --> 22:51.972
I never tell anybody about
our private conversations.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.076
I wouldn't really know how.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.370
Let's cut my stupid scene
out of this piece of crap.

22:57.418 --> 22:59.128
But then won't we need
to add 30 seconds?

22:59.420 --> 23:01.213
I have an idea about that.

23:01.505 --> 23:03.299
Who am I?

23:03.591 --> 23:04.800
What's my motivation?

23:05.092 --> 23:08.971
Why am I doing or saying
anything I'm saying or doing?

23:09.263 --> 23:10.306
I need more...

23:10.598 --> 23:12.558
I need more than
what I'm getting.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.108
Hello, Chief Starr.

23:24.862 --> 23:26.864
I told you I'd see you in hell.

23:28.866 --> 23:30.451
And look who else is here.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.994
Yooba dooba dooba!

23:45.382 --> 23:47.593
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

23:47.885 --> 23:50.012
Oh, great job, you guys,
on the new ending.

23:50.304 --> 23:53.307
I like that the guy
actually saw him in hell.

23:53.599 --> 23:55.559
Right?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.686
Whoa, whoa. Hold on, phone call,

23:57.978 --> 23:59.980
from the distributor.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.149
Get ready for a big check.

24:02.983 --> 24:04.360
Yellow?

24:04.652 --> 24:06.695
Wait. Calm down.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.155
What's Chapter 11?

24:09.239 --> 24:11.075
Wait, what's YouTube?

24:11.367 --> 24:12.576
Wait, what's broadband?

24:13.243 --> 24:14.495
What's digital?

24:14.787 --> 24:16.538
I don't have a good
feeling about that call.

24:16.830 --> 24:19.070
I don't have a good feeling
about Chang staying bankable.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.613
Did you guys see this new story?

24:20.876 --> 24:22.276
I'll never look
at a hot air balloon

24:22.503 --> 24:25.714
in the same way again
or James Franco's ball.

24:28.676 --> 24:31.095
I'll tell you what I do have
a good feeling about.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.554
- Bring it in.
- Aww.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.348
Come here, guys. Aww.

24:36.433 --> 24:39.269
- Do to thing.
- Dooba. Dooba. Dooba.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.188
Dooba. Dooba. Dooba.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.607
All right,
one more for safety, Ben.

24:43.899 --> 24:45.418
What do you mean,
"One more for safety"?

24:45.442 --> 24:48.320
I just don't know if we got
the line, "Hold on, Slinky."

24:48.612 --> 24:49.905
Let's move on.

24:50.197 --> 24:52.408
I think, can we get one more?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.618
You got it. Come on.

24:54.910 --> 24:56.912
Hold on, Slinky! Let's go.

24:57.204 --> 25:00.249
I think it was fine, but
Steven's kind of a stickler.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.751
Tell Steven Spielberg
to lick my butt.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.004
Well, he's right here, so...

25:07.256 --> 25:09.925
Hey, Steven... Spielberg.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.095
Can you give us a sec?

25:13.387 --> 25:14.387
Yes.

25:24.314 --> 25:25.816
Ben? Yup?

25:26.108 --> 25:28.027
So, I guess
we're good for today.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.528
Great job. You were right.

25:29.820 --> 25:30.860
We got everything we need,

25:31.113 --> 25:33.615
and there's a small door
in the back.

25:33.907 --> 25:36.660
Back of the booth there,
that will take you,

25:36.952 --> 25:39.872
you know, outside,
and we'll talk soon.

25:40.164 --> 25:41.540
I don't go the way I came?

25:41.832 --> 25:42.832
You do not.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.376
There's a little door
back there.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.755
And it goes right on out.
Thank you so much.

25:48.589 --> 25:49.590
Okay.

25:52.968 --> 25:53.969
Okay.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.321
Okay, Randall, are you ready?
Yup.

26:15.866 --> 26:17.618
Which brings us to the issue

26:17.910 --> 26:19.995
of our cosmetology department,

26:20.287 --> 26:21.789
who, once again,
find themselves...

26:40.349 --> 26:41.391
Who, once again,

26:41.683 --> 26:43.523
find themselves nearing
the end of the semester

26:43.560 --> 26:46.647
without any free haircut
volunteers.

26:55.614 --> 26:59.535
That may be due to last
semester's lice scare.

26:59.827 --> 27:01.328
Totally. Yep.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.376
Maybe if we put up a sign,
"Guaranteed: No lice."

27:07.668 --> 27:08.710
Something like that.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.088
That would open you up
to lawsuits.

27:11.380 --> 27:13.715
Son, we live in a world that
has walls, and those walls

27:14.007 --> 27:16.218
have to be guarded
by men with hair clippers.

27:19.847 --> 27:21.557
Pink Floyd. Ugh.

27:21.849 --> 27:22.891
You're the worst.

27:23.183 --> 27:24.685
What? Oh, she is the worst.

27:24.977 --> 27:26.788
Terrible. ELROY: I can't
believe she said that.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.480
Have you seen any movies?
Any one movie?

27:28.772 --> 27:30.083
- Unrelated thought.
- We're all enjoying...

27:30.107 --> 27:31.108
Britta's the worst!
