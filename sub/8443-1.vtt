00:16.636 --> 00:19.423
History teaches us
that men behave wisely...

00:19.681 --> 00:22.386
...once they've exhausted
all other alternatives.

00:22.643 --> 00:25.976
For most rock bands, the pursuit
of wisdom's a low priority...

00:26.229 --> 00:29.264
...compared to fame, fortune
and fornication.

00:29.523 --> 00:31.682
Such a band was "Strange Fruit. "

00:31.943 --> 00:35.526
- You said this is an important gig!
- It is!

00:35.780 --> 00:38.353
It's a waterlogged field
miles from anywhere.

00:38.616 --> 00:42.068
I was the road dog 20 years ago when
they played the Wisbech Rock Festival.

00:42.329 --> 00:45.081
There's 20,000 fans out there
waiting for you.

00:45.330 --> 00:47.822
They can't go anywhere.
They're up to their bollocks in mud.

00:48.083 --> 00:50.753
We should sing "Painted Lady"
as a tribute to Keith.

00:51.004 --> 00:52.249
Why? What's the point?

00:52.506 --> 00:54.913
It's two years since he
passed on.

00:55.175 --> 00:58.874
He didn't "pass on. "
He OD'd in a Little Chef.

00:59.136 --> 01:01.759
Nice thought, but it'll
bring everybody down.

01:02.015 --> 01:03.889
You told us we'd close the night.

01:04.141 --> 01:07.641
No, I didn't. I said you'd go on after
Blodwyn Pig and Uriah Heep.

01:07.894 --> 01:08.927
What about Mott the Hoople?

01:09.190 --> 01:11.182
I can't move that. It's a done deal.

01:11.442 --> 01:14.229
We're the Fruits, Neil.
We're the Fruits!

01:14.486 --> 01:16.894
- You should be on stage.
- Without Brian?

01:17.155 --> 01:19.647
Where is he?
And where's Karen?

01:19.908 --> 01:21.237
It's a question of stature.

01:21.493 --> 01:23.782
You have to consider where
we stand in the overall spectrum.

01:24.037 --> 01:25.151
Where do we, Ray?

01:25.413 --> 01:26.955
Above Mott the fucking Hoople.

01:27.206 --> 01:30.124
We're on at 3 a.m.
No one will be awake.

01:30.377 --> 01:31.787
Lindisfarne went on in daylight.

01:32.045 --> 01:34.915
So they should,
they're fucking folk singers!

01:35.173 --> 01:38.460
What's he on?
Horse tranquilizers?

01:38.719 --> 01:41.424
- You were to look after him, Karen.
- I never let him out of my sight.

01:41.681 --> 01:44.715
Forget about the album
and all that negative press stuff.

01:44.974 --> 01:46.005
Go out there.

01:46.267 --> 01:49.684
Remind them what the Fruits
were, are, will be!

01:49.938 --> 01:52.856
You've been very patient,
but it's worth waiting for.

01:53.108 --> 01:54.768
I know you want to see the guys.

01:55.027 --> 01:58.028
So let's hear it for Strange Fruit!

02:13.504 --> 02:14.914
Watch where you turn

02:15.172 --> 02:16.418
It might be today

02:20.053 --> 02:21.250
For fuck's sake!

02:21.512 --> 02:22.922
You lose your head

02:23.430 --> 02:24.711
Then just throw it away

02:34.650 --> 02:36.478
It was their last gig.

02:36.736 --> 02:38.016
Divine intervention...

02:38.279 --> 02:39.821
...pulled the plug on the Fruits.

02:40.614 --> 02:42.606
I think God just got sick of...

02:42.866 --> 02:44.409
...all that 70s excess.

02:44.661 --> 02:47.068
That's why He invented The Sex Pistols.

02:47.371 --> 02:48.866
That ought to tell us something.

03:00.300 --> 03:04.464
So they went their separate ways,
dragging their dwindling royalties...

03:04.722 --> 03:06.880
...and bruised egos behind them.

03:07.140 --> 03:08.421
Tony sold his Yamaha...

03:09.144 --> 03:12.726
...but he still puts "rock star"
as his job description.

03:12.981 --> 03:14.773
Mind you, for the last few years...

03:15.025 --> 03:18.191
...no one's been quite sure
what it is he actually does.

03:20.196 --> 03:21.109
Tony Costello?

03:22.782 --> 03:24.028
Maybe.

03:24.325 --> 03:25.274
Who wants to know?

03:26.494 --> 03:28.404
Strange Fruit, right?

03:28.830 --> 03:30.028
Steve Greenblatt.

03:30.289 --> 03:31.665
Big fan of yours, Tony.

03:31.917 --> 03:33.826
God, this is amazing.

03:34.085 --> 03:35.877
My dad put on the Wisbech Rock Festival.

03:36.088 --> 03:37.711
Yeah? No kidding?

03:37.964 --> 03:39.339
Can I buy you a drink?

03:40.091 --> 03:42.298
Maybe later.
I have some business.

03:43.761 --> 03:46.928
You live here?
Retired to the sun, eh?

03:47.182 --> 03:48.759
Lucky you.

03:52.979 --> 03:54.225
- How's business?
- Slow.

03:55.981 --> 03:58.057
English are not here.

03:58.817 --> 04:01.309
Bloody hell, things are slow.

04:07.201 --> 04:09.824
Karen still had ink on her fingers
from school...

04:10.081 --> 04:11.788
...when she went to work
for the Fruits.

04:12.041 --> 04:13.416
Started by sorting their laundry.

04:13.668 --> 04:16.418
By Wisbech,
she was sorting their lives.

04:16.668 --> 04:19.755
They treated her like crap,
but she loved the music...

04:20.007 --> 04:21.252
...and idolized Brian.

04:21.507 --> 04:23.715
That bastard was a near-genius...

04:23.969 --> 04:27.219
...but hell-bent on going
the way of his brother Keith...

04:27.472 --> 04:30.391
...already dead
from a drug overdose.

04:30.643 --> 04:31.674
Baby?

04:31.936 --> 04:33.051
Get some fucking help!

04:34.145 --> 04:38.309
So she did a complete 180:.
Marriage, mortgage, daughter, a divorce.

04:38.567 --> 04:40.358
Welcome to the Viking Hotel.

04:40.611 --> 04:42.484
Everything's set up for you
in the Collingwood Suite.

04:42.738 --> 04:45.691
You'll find tea and coffee,
leaded and unleaded.

04:45.949 --> 04:49.366
Lunch will be served at 12:30.
Thank you.

04:51.163 --> 04:53.285
Brilliant, Karen.
I'll buy you a drink later.

04:53.706 --> 04:55.534
Admiral's Locker at six?

04:58.503 --> 05:00.828
He brings 12
conferences a year here.

05:01.089 --> 05:02.833
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

05:03.092 --> 05:04.372
He tries it every time.

05:04.634 --> 05:07.553
What this job needs
is a people pleaser.

05:07.805 --> 05:09.216
Sometimes I think
you don't even like people.

05:09.473 --> 05:12.593
Pleasing people
is letting them touch my arse?

05:14.227 --> 05:18.179
- Can I have the Mitsubishi list?
- Hi, babe. What's happening?

05:22.653 --> 05:23.898
Tony!

05:24.280 --> 05:26.854
He's the son
of the original promoter...

05:27.117 --> 05:29.608
...of the Wisbech Rock Festival.

05:31.203 --> 05:33.409
He wants to set it up again.

05:33.663 --> 05:36.666
20th anniversary.
A lot of the original acts.

05:37.669 --> 05:40.290
- And he wants the Fruits.
- Sure.

05:41.630 --> 05:43.089
Come on. Come on!

05:43.340 --> 05:46.046
I'm at work, Tony.
What do you want?

05:46.303 --> 05:49.636
I've no idea how
to track the guys down.

05:49.846 --> 05:51.424
I could use a little help.

05:53.809 --> 05:56.845
Mitsubishi delegates are wandering
around reception like lost sheep.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.643
I'll be with you
in one minute.

06:02.318 --> 06:06.648
You can't see this happening?
You hated each other in the end.

06:06.865 --> 06:08.442
Hate's a bit heavy.

06:08.699 --> 06:10.775
I need a few phone numbers.
That's all.

06:11.285 --> 06:13.742
I owe it to the guys
to let them know about it.

06:13.997 --> 06:16.370
Some of them
may not be doing so well.

06:17.250 --> 06:19.456
Desperate times best forgotten.

06:20.628 --> 06:23.500
I had enough rock 'n' roll
to last a lifetime.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.506
So you gave it all up for this.

06:49.282 --> 06:52.533
Les Wickes was the most pissed off
when the band broke up.

06:52.786 --> 06:55.158
He'd been pissed off
since Keith died...

06:55.413 --> 06:57.287
...and Ray Simms replaced him.

06:57.624 --> 06:59.663
He swears he doesn't miss it.

07:00.085 --> 07:01.994
Well, his wife believes him.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.208
You could break your neck
in those heels.

07:05.757 --> 07:09.968
There's only two reasons to get you
to haul your ass up here.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.714
Either I owe you money...

07:13.307 --> 07:14.137
Or?

07:14.474 --> 07:16.966
Or you want to put
the band back together.

07:17.185 --> 07:18.680
We had a shot.

07:19.312 --> 07:21.472
A real shot for greatness.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.271
Don't tell me it hasn't
haunted you.

07:26.277 --> 07:27.309
Nope.

07:27.904 --> 07:31.605
I'm just glad I got out when I did.
Built up a decent business.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.284
That's Camille talking.

07:36.997 --> 07:38.954
Is it stickier going down?

07:39.376 --> 07:42.045
You wanted it as much as any of us.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.205
Money, hit records, being famous.

07:45.463 --> 07:48.298
Don't tell me this is a step up, Les.

08:00.312 --> 08:02.555
You frightened the life out of me.

08:03.273 --> 08:04.471
What are you doing?

08:05.776 --> 08:07.732
Look at all this stuff.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.315
Should've straightened it out years ago.

08:10.364 --> 08:11.562
Why didn't you?

08:13.910 --> 08:15.701
You might like to wear these.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.907
Oh, God.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.329
Costello Music. Good morning.

09:00.580 --> 09:01.991
Tony, it's me.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.994
Listen, I've just handed in my notice.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.581
You're in?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.536
Fantastic, man.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.343
Can't believe he managed
to hang on to this pile.

09:16.599 --> 09:18.722
Ray was always careful with his money.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.643
And I'm dossing down
at my sister's flat.

09:23.479 --> 09:26.267
The only thing I have of value
is this.

09:26.567 --> 09:27.942
What is it?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.816
Jimi Hendrix's tooth.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.480
There was a fight in a club
on Oxford Street.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.113
Somebody planked him and I picked it up.

09:36.702 --> 09:38.445
I knew he was a genius even then.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.696
You think it'd fetch
a fortune, right?

09:40.955 --> 09:43.625
Absolutely. No two ways about it.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.501
What's going on here?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.001
Ladies and gentlemen...

09:51.257 --> 09:54.378
...a toast by our host,
the father of the bride.

10:00.391 --> 10:01.968
One, two.

10:05.813 --> 10:07.142
Hello, Wembley.

10:12.614 --> 10:14.073
As you know, I'm a man of music...

10:14.866 --> 10:16.442
...and Tamsin...

10:16.950 --> 10:18.195
...is a child of song.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.790
She remains
one of the best songs I ever wrote.

10:24.041 --> 10:26.034
I think our timing's a bit off.

10:27.169 --> 10:30.004
Well, I should say, co-wrote...

10:30.256 --> 10:31.667
...with her mother...

10:31.925 --> 10:33.549
...June, who we're...

10:34.927 --> 10:37.714
...lucky enough to have
with us today.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.179
What was the name
of his band?

10:40.433 --> 10:44.181
Trying to remember.
It's driving me crazy.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.516
Strange Fruit.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.308
- Strange...?
- Fruit.

10:48.524 --> 10:50.517
I'd like to read this,
which is...

10:50.777 --> 10:55.188
...from my first solo album,
Taking Wing.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.936
Thank you.

10:57.907 --> 11:00.067
"Love is the heat...

11:00.703 --> 11:02.991
...that melts the wax of wings.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.241
Fly close to that heat...

11:06.500 --> 11:08.576
...dear girl, fly close.

11:09.504 --> 11:11.082
For when the smoke clears...

11:11.339 --> 11:13.213
...what remains?

11:13.467 --> 11:17.049
The sweet kissing breath
of lips and thighs...

11:17.303 --> 11:21.467
...and sky-blue eyes that love. "

11:41.119 --> 11:44.487
- You're ex-directory, obviously.
- No, it's cool.

11:44.747 --> 11:47.286
Why don't we talk in the crypt?

11:48.752 --> 11:51.456
Tony's trying to get the Fruits
together for a reunion.

11:53.464 --> 11:54.329
Really?

11:56.174 --> 11:58.050
Have you spoken to Les?

11:58.469 --> 12:01.921
We wanted to talk to you first,
naturally.

12:02.181 --> 12:05.265
It was always complex karma
between him and me...

12:05.518 --> 12:07.677
...from the moment I joined the band.

12:07.938 --> 12:10.429
It was long ago, Ray.
We've all moved on.

12:10.648 --> 12:14.777
He said you were a wanker, but he always
thought you had great pipes.

12:15.612 --> 12:18.282
What are you doing here? Please.

12:18.532 --> 12:20.110
Hello, baby.

12:20.826 --> 12:21.857
Hello, Astrid.

12:22.494 --> 12:25.698
Hello. I am forgetting.
Did we invite you?

12:26.165 --> 12:29.035
They're getting the Fruits together.

12:30.251 --> 12:32.493
Why would you want to?

12:32.754 --> 12:37.582
A lot of outfits are surfing
the nostalgia wave, cleaning up.

12:38.051 --> 12:40.625
Ray is in the middle of a solo album.

12:40.887 --> 12:42.465
- We work night and day.
- "We"?

12:42.723 --> 12:44.467
Ray plays every instrument himself.

12:44.725 --> 12:48.177
Sometimes I make
percussions on tinkerbells.

12:48.437 --> 12:51.354
This is very "happening now" music.

12:51.606 --> 12:53.183
Strange Fruit?

12:54.109 --> 12:57.359
It's passé. They're an old hat.

13:02.951 --> 13:06.652
- Without a singer, we're bollixed.
- But Astrid said no. Not Ray.

13:06.913 --> 13:09.450
His last solo album was in '89.

13:09.707 --> 13:11.367
Dying for a pee.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.372
- Hang on.
- Where are you going?

13:13.630 --> 13:17.045
I'm not going back in there.
I'm not dressed for the occasion.

13:19.927 --> 13:21.718
Come and look at this!

13:28.143 --> 13:31.263
He's got it on the market.
This is all a front.

13:31.521 --> 13:33.147
Bet he's as broke as I am.

13:41.866 --> 13:42.981
Mrs. Baggot?

13:44.577 --> 13:45.407
Who's asking?

13:45.869 --> 13:47.447
I'm Karen Knowles.

13:47.704 --> 13:49.862
This is Tony Costello.

13:51.250 --> 13:54.002
Do you remember us from years ago?
With the band?

13:54.294 --> 13:55.493
Yeah.

13:56.755 --> 13:59.294
Beano sold all his gold disks,
you know.

13:59.550 --> 14:01.590
Well, the wife took everything.

14:01.844 --> 14:04.680
The cow. Lives in Wales now.

14:04.930 --> 14:06.092
Serves her right.

14:06.348 --> 14:07.676
Does he still live with you?

14:07.933 --> 14:09.391
No. Moved away.

14:09.644 --> 14:10.640
Where to?

14:11.270 --> 14:12.598
Over there.

14:15.400 --> 14:18.354
Comes home for
his meals and his washing.

14:19.321 --> 14:20.864
Where can we contact him?

14:21.949 --> 14:24.355
You're the second lot
looking for him this morning.

14:24.576 --> 14:27.066
He's at work. At the nursery.

14:27.328 --> 14:29.120
He works in a nursery?

14:29.789 --> 14:31.118
Not with children?

14:31.542 --> 14:36.582
If you don't put these in today,
give them a drink before bedtime.

14:36.837 --> 14:38.214
Remember, they don't like lime.

14:38.465 --> 14:42.213
Excuse me, do you know if
David Baggot works here?

14:42.428 --> 14:44.917
Sometimes known as "Beano" Baggot?

14:47.639 --> 14:50.926
There was a Mr. Baggot
worked here a while back.

14:51.186 --> 14:54.187
Had to leave.
Allergic to azaleas, apparently.

14:54.439 --> 14:56.016
It turned his piss green.

14:56.273 --> 14:58.481
Where can we get in touch with him?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.773
One of the girls had a postcard
from Zimbabwe, I think.

15:02.029 --> 15:03.737
A call for you, Beano!

15:04.657 --> 15:08.276
I'll be straight there!
Just turn the hose off.

15:08.578 --> 15:09.408
Excuse me!

15:10.288 --> 15:12.327
If it's true that men
are from Mars...

15:12.582 --> 15:14.622
...and women are from Venus,
then drummers...

15:14.877 --> 15:16.420
...are from Pluto.

15:16.629 --> 15:19.203
The others were haunted by the past.

15:19.465 --> 15:21.920
Beano worried it may catch up with him.

15:27.890 --> 15:29.301
What you doing here?

15:29.683 --> 15:32.174
How do you feel about getting
together again?

15:32.436 --> 15:34.144
Not a moment too soon.

16:10.224 --> 16:12.015
Bastard. Please.

16:12.266 --> 16:15.969
Come on. Do me a fucking favor,
would you?

16:16.732 --> 16:19.352
You can do it. Come on, do that.

16:20.526 --> 16:22.269
Will you shut up?!

16:22.527 --> 16:25.446
Button it! Fucker.

16:25.698 --> 16:27.774
Yeah, come on, please.

16:32.622 --> 16:36.205
All I want is to watch the Brazilian
Grand Prix. Which button is it?!

16:36.459 --> 16:39.032
- There's a limousine outside.
- What?

16:39.295 --> 16:42.166
Obviously, Karen did this.
She must think we are so easy.

16:47.053 --> 16:48.167
Mr. Simms?

16:48.804 --> 16:50.085
Big fan, sir!

16:50.472 --> 16:52.881
The reunion lunch is at 12:30!

16:55.979 --> 16:57.603
Give me a few minutes!

16:58.147 --> 17:00.222
- This came for you.
- Thanks.

17:00.440 --> 17:04.439
Try to be back by four,
even if it is your last week.

17:38.521 --> 17:41.059
I'm not sure how long this will take.

17:41.275 --> 17:42.685
I'm not to take you back.

17:43.318 --> 17:46.272
Costello Music said
you'd be taking the train.

17:46.487 --> 17:49.193
Well, there's some mistake, surely.

17:51.577 --> 17:54.743
You were engaged to a
Guinness heiress, wasn't it?

17:55.120 --> 17:57.196
Yeah, but they paid me to go away.

17:57.957 --> 18:01.291
- Not enough, by the look of you.
- Never is, man.

18:09.719 --> 18:11.547
You old tosser!

18:13.972 --> 18:15.468
- How you doing?
- All right.

18:15.768 --> 18:18.520
I was reminding Tony about
that night in Air Studios...

18:18.729 --> 18:21.220
...we caught you shagging that
singer on an amp.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.354
Surely not.

18:24.818 --> 18:26.610
Why are we meeting here?

18:26.821 --> 18:28.778
We shot an album cover here
years ago.

18:29.031 --> 18:31.071
That was before Ray's time.

18:31.909 --> 18:35.242
We dropped some acid
in the Druids' Circle.

18:46.132 --> 18:48.290
Brian wrote
quite a good song.

18:48.509 --> 18:50.666
The last verse even rhymed.

18:51.303 --> 18:53.176
Do you want a beer, Ray?

18:54.723 --> 18:56.632
Jack Daniels, right?

18:57.226 --> 18:59.183
It's usually Evian nowadays.

18:59.478 --> 19:02.478
- And I don't touch those anymore.
- How about a sausage, then?

19:07.111 --> 19:08.391
Hey, Wicksey!

19:10.739 --> 19:12.197
Hey. Great.

19:12.407 --> 19:14.150
Still pounding them drums?

19:18.290 --> 19:21.041
- How are you, Ray?
- Cool. Thanks, Les.

19:21.876 --> 19:23.916
- Like the T-shirt.
- This?

19:24.588 --> 19:27.707
- What's that mean?
- It's a Zen quotation.

19:27.966 --> 19:32.093
Is it? I thought that was
Japanese for "Calvin Klein. "

19:33.680 --> 19:36.883
Are we getting a table,
or waiting for Brian?

19:37.308 --> 19:38.588
He won't be here.

19:39.269 --> 19:41.759
I've got news about Brian.

19:43.982 --> 19:47.316
I reckoned his song royalties
must be paid somewhere...

19:47.527 --> 19:49.685
...so I tried his publishers...

19:49.903 --> 19:53.320
...and I got a fax
just before I left work.

19:53.574 --> 19:55.282
But it was too late
to call you all.

19:55.493 --> 19:57.236
Call us all about what?

19:58.037 --> 20:01.870
His royalties have been paid to a
cancer foundation in the States...

20:02.084 --> 20:03.543
...for the last five years.

20:03.793 --> 20:05.418
He gave his royalties away?

20:05.629 --> 20:08.581
Gave his Rolls away once
to his window cleaner.

20:09.172 --> 20:10.667
This is a bequest.

20:11.550 --> 20:13.259
Something you leave in a will.

20:15.639 --> 20:17.715
You mean the silly sod's dead?

20:36.701 --> 20:40.616
It was always in the cards,
something like this. He was...

20:40.831 --> 20:42.990
...you know what I'm saying...

20:43.208 --> 20:44.867
...fragile.

20:46.127 --> 20:47.918
And we crushed him.

20:49.130 --> 20:52.582
Keith screwed himself up,
we screwed up Brian.

20:54.427 --> 20:56.420
So make it up to him.

20:56.804 --> 20:59.558
Do the gig and let people
hear his songs.

21:00.017 --> 21:04.642
If Wisbech works out, maybe the record
company will rerelease the old albums.

21:04.854 --> 21:05.684
Definitely.

21:06.105 --> 21:08.145
- What do you say?
- Can't see it.

21:08.608 --> 21:10.731
We'd bollix it all over again.

21:12.529 --> 21:14.984
Pretty pointless reunion.

21:15.282 --> 21:18.319
Suppose I might get
a shepherd's pie out of it.

21:21.956 --> 21:23.331
You hear that?

21:35.720 --> 21:38.839
- That's Brian.
- Yes. Tequila Mockingbird.

21:40.058 --> 21:41.173
Track one.

21:47.815 --> 21:49.724
Is that spooky, or what?

21:54.279 --> 21:55.738
It's a sign.

21:57.408 --> 22:00.195
A message from
the gods of rock 'n' roll.

22:12.423 --> 22:15.211
Oh you dangerous things

22:17.596 --> 22:19.754
I'm not sure of the vibe here.

22:20.139 --> 22:24.719
Maybe we should've rented in the
country. Somewhere more cloistered.

22:24.936 --> 22:28.601
What's wrong with your place?
You've got enough bedrooms.

22:28.815 --> 22:32.682
That would've been cool,
but we're having the lake drained.

22:38.074 --> 22:40.363
I'm very surprised you'd do this.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.984
I suppose you hope
to see Brian again.

22:44.706 --> 22:46.248
Doing it for all of us.

22:47.459 --> 22:50.709
Even though you married,
he was the love of your life.

22:50.961 --> 22:53.584
That's very sad
for a woman of your age.

22:54.550 --> 22:57.716
Astrid was wrong.
Age has got sod-all to do with it.

22:57.969 --> 23:02.429
And if they're putting their balls
on the block again, I won't miss it.

23:02.681 --> 23:05.054
Fuck me! I can't believe it!

23:05.268 --> 23:09.182
What've I strayed into here?
Night of the Living Dead!

23:12.401 --> 23:15.604
You big sack of shite!
Beano Baggot!

23:16.656 --> 23:18.362
Where's Tony?

23:18.740 --> 23:20.282
Tony-boy!

23:20.533 --> 23:21.529
Look at you!

23:21.786 --> 23:23.446
Big bollock!
Let me see.

23:23.662 --> 23:27.031
Cuban heels! He's been
walking downhill since 1969.

23:27.291 --> 23:31.419
I have made herb tea for everyone,
and also dried fruit.

23:31.671 --> 23:34.161
You'll get fat if you
just eat Mars bars.

23:34.757 --> 23:39.797
Well, Astrid, my wee Nordic charmer,
so you and Ray went the distance.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.427
Are you still a road dog, Hughie?

23:42.681 --> 23:47.142
The last tour I did was ten years ago,
with Aerosmith.

23:47.352 --> 23:50.139
But it's all wheatgrass juice
and pumpkin seeds now.

23:50.398 --> 23:53.813
Hope you're still crazy, or I'm out.
I have a surprise.

23:54.026 --> 23:55.188
Eat something.

23:55.443 --> 23:59.108
Strange Fruit!
Rock musicians, poets, legends!

23:59.614 --> 24:01.857
This is your life!

24:02.075 --> 24:03.949
Except for these. That's my life.

24:04.828 --> 24:06.405
Some memories in here.

24:06.663 --> 24:08.952
- Don't believe it.
- Hello.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.619
How did these get here?

24:11.043 --> 24:13.913
Groupies keep them on their mantelpiece.
Sent ours back.

24:14.837 --> 24:16.165
Look at this bugger.

24:16.422 --> 24:18.998
Hello? Testing. One, two, three.

24:19.218 --> 24:22.670
Ray! Ask Astrid
if she recognizes this.

24:22.889 --> 24:24.431
Give me my horns, man!

25:13.730 --> 25:14.679
No, no.

25:14.982 --> 25:17.355
That's not it. Just a minute.

25:21.156 --> 25:22.187
That's not it.

25:22.407 --> 25:25.028
- What's not it?
- The way you sing it.

25:25.285 --> 25:26.744
I'm sorry, Les.

25:26.996 --> 25:29.617
It's not a wimpy song, you know.

25:29.873 --> 25:32.707
It's got to be sung with balls.

25:32.959 --> 25:36.542
Given, Ray, but they
can't be borrowed balls.

25:36.796 --> 25:40.296
Recycled balls.
They have to be Fruit balls.

25:40.842 --> 25:44.887
What he's saying is Keith used to
sing it with more...

25:45.973 --> 25:46.838
...panache.

25:47.057 --> 25:50.888
You wouldn't know panache
if it bit you on the ass, Beano.

25:54.898 --> 25:56.974
- Pill break.
- Hand them around.

25:57.651 --> 26:00.521
From my herbalist.
They won't get you high.

26:00.779 --> 26:02.771
- Yeah, well, we can try.
- Here.

26:07.702 --> 26:10.406
Why don't I take the guitar break
on the synth...

26:10.663 --> 26:13.070
...so you can focus on the singing?

26:14.501 --> 26:17.917
It'd help if I could hear myself
over Beano's drumming.

26:18.797 --> 26:20.624
Sounds like he's building a shed.

26:20.883 --> 26:21.712
Steady.

26:23.929 --> 26:29.052
He should go back on the sauce.
Get some juice back in his voice.

26:29.349 --> 26:32.185
The guy's easing himself in.
We all are.

26:35.063 --> 26:39.891
In an uncertain world, it's good
to know some things never change.

26:40.111 --> 26:42.234
These stairs here?
Thank you.

27:05.802 --> 27:07.711
Where have you been hiding?

27:07.970 --> 27:09.714
Doing different things.

27:10.222 --> 27:14.056
Wanted to get back in the biz,
make sure the timing's right.

27:14.311 --> 27:15.591
Strange Fruit?

27:16.604 --> 27:20.390
There's a whole new audience
discovering 70s stuff.

27:21.444 --> 27:25.856
It's a great time to bring out
some reissues, maybe even a box set.

27:26.198 --> 27:28.191
Listen to you, sweetie.

27:28.408 --> 27:31.031
20 years ago, you were
Neil Gaydon's doormat.

27:31.871 --> 27:34.825
Well, you were a tea boy
at Virgin, Clive.

27:35.041 --> 27:38.327
- Came to you first.
- Only because I own their catalog.

27:39.796 --> 27:41.456
I used to fancy Brian.

27:41.715 --> 27:44.880
Had that dirty, sweet,
helpless Marc Bolan thing.

27:45.092 --> 27:48.461
- Where is he, rehab or ashram?
- We're tracking him down.

27:49.513 --> 27:51.341
The other guys are really juiced.

27:51.599 --> 27:53.010
Strange Fruit.

27:53.225 --> 27:54.221
Cool name.

27:54.436 --> 27:56.392
Tour them. That's my advice.

27:57.146 --> 27:59.519
Good idea. Maybe colleges?

27:59.774 --> 28:03.473
Not the U.K., sweetie.
Get them across the Channel.

28:04.403 --> 28:06.027
See what they've got.

28:14.455 --> 28:17.741
How do you feel about your mom
getting back into this?

28:18.001 --> 28:20.836
I hope we can pay
the mortgage next month.

28:22.547 --> 28:23.792
Tell me, Clare.

28:26.092 --> 28:28.714
What's the situation, boyfriend-wise?

28:28.971 --> 28:30.346
I've had a couple.

28:30.597 --> 28:32.008
Nothing serious.

28:32.849 --> 28:35.008
I'm talking about your mother.

28:36.020 --> 28:40.727
Why is a nice girl like you
putting herself through this crap again?

28:41.148 --> 28:44.150
- Revenge?
- If it's crap, why are you here?

28:44.652 --> 28:48.947
I seem to have this irresistible urge
to chronicle human folly.

28:49.199 --> 28:50.942
I still love their music.

28:52.327 --> 28:56.575
I want to stand in the dark and
see an audience feel the way I do.

28:57.291 --> 28:58.702
Panic-stricken?

29:01.336 --> 29:02.533
Just keep singing!

29:05.340 --> 29:07.048
You know why that is.

29:08.134 --> 29:10.755
There's a hole
in the middle of this band.

29:12.097 --> 29:13.923
It's called Brian Lovell.

29:14.225 --> 29:17.428
All we need is a guitarist
with a bit of charisma.

29:18.688 --> 29:20.430
Do you want a hit on this?

29:21.564 --> 29:23.807
Haven't done that in years.

29:28.906 --> 29:31.741
Now may be a very good time to start.

29:37.331 --> 29:39.240
Could you sign this, please?

29:40.333 --> 29:41.613
Sure, man.

29:44.213 --> 29:45.790
"Best wishes... "

29:46.840 --> 29:48.003
...to who?

29:48.801 --> 29:51.718
I need a signature for the pizzas.

30:01.479 --> 30:02.678
Dickhead.

30:24.712 --> 30:26.586
Are you sure about this one?

30:26.839 --> 30:30.210
He'll make you sound younger,
make you look younger.

30:35.848 --> 30:38.136
He's all show-off.
We don't need him.

30:38.392 --> 30:40.433
Clive's paying for these rehearsals.

30:40.645 --> 30:44.594
He may underwrite a tour, but
he'll notice that Brian's not there.

30:44.816 --> 30:47.935
There's got to be someone
brilliant in his place.

30:48.194 --> 30:50.401
Ray's doing this for the boys.

30:50.613 --> 30:53.484
We have many stoves in the fire.
We don't need it.

30:53.741 --> 30:56.066
How are Kirby, Steele and Oakes?

30:57.745 --> 30:59.370
I never listen to their music.

30:59.622 --> 31:04.450
Your estate agents.
So don't tell me you don't need this.

31:07.922 --> 31:10.496
You're a bloody nosy bitch.
Also a slut.

31:11.426 --> 31:12.802
I remember Isle of Wight.

31:13.051 --> 31:13.917
Come on, Ray.

31:39.788 --> 31:41.282
Is that all right?

31:43.250 --> 31:44.080
Call me.

31:44.334 --> 31:45.448
You know I'll call.

31:45.752 --> 31:48.505
I call you even when I'm up on a roof.

31:50.716 --> 31:52.708
But if this thing works out...

31:53.634 --> 31:55.710
...you won't see me up a ladder again.

31:58.932 --> 32:01.683
It took us a long time
to build this business.

32:06.649 --> 32:07.562
Yeah.

32:07.817 --> 32:09.477
And I hate it, Camille.

32:09.735 --> 32:11.726
I really hate it.

32:13.946 --> 32:16.652
Your train tickets
and your traveling checks.

32:16.909 --> 32:20.029
I faxed Karen about your vitamins,
how many and how often.

32:20.288 --> 32:21.319
Wish you were coming.

32:21.580 --> 32:26.492
I'm not going on a bus
with them all drinking beer and farting.

32:26.711 --> 32:30.161
Karen arrange flights for me.
Give her your credit card number.

32:30.422 --> 32:31.832
I don't know it.

32:34.468 --> 32:36.793
It's on your credit card.

33:02.246 --> 33:04.998
Feast your eyes on this
magnificent land yacht.

33:05.249 --> 33:08.913
Tinted windows, air conditioning,
and twin portaloos.

33:09.128 --> 33:12.497
Not to mention an extensive
library of pornography...

33:12.756 --> 33:17.502
...courtesy of the Psychedelic Furs'
world tour of 1988.

33:17.762 --> 33:20.597
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

33:21.892 --> 33:23.221
Pongs a bit in here.

33:23.477 --> 33:25.885
Think one of the Furs
is still in here?

33:26.604 --> 33:27.849
That's pedigree.

33:28.565 --> 33:32.016
Smell that
Dettol... fag-ends... vomit.

33:32.276 --> 33:36.405
Yes! I love the smell
of vomit in the morning!

33:50.212 --> 33:51.077
Wait!

33:57.260 --> 33:58.209
Wait!

33:58.469 --> 33:59.799
Karen, look!

34:00.013 --> 34:01.425
Harpoon that whale!

34:05.100 --> 34:07.306
Go, Beano, go! You can do it!

34:07.561 --> 34:10.266
- Peel rubber, Hughie!
- Paternity suit, eh?

34:13.568 --> 34:15.110
Wait! Wait!

34:15.360 --> 34:18.648
I bet she's bloody Inland Revenue,
come out of the woodwork.

34:21.619 --> 34:25.283
- What's the problem?
- I owe the buggers 33,000 pounds.

34:26.080 --> 34:26.911
How?

34:28.376 --> 34:30.202
Bad management.

34:30.585 --> 34:34.963
In the history of the Fruits, you're
our strongest link to the past.

34:35.215 --> 34:36.081
Thank you.

34:36.341 --> 34:41.253
In all the time I've known you,
there's been zero growth.

34:41.514 --> 34:43.920
You're what they call a "flatliner. "

34:45.641 --> 34:48.098
It's better than being a "wanker. "

35:00.825 --> 35:01.653
That's right.

35:01.908 --> 35:04.446
Astrid will join us
in a couple of days.

35:04.702 --> 35:08.286
Could somebody look into flights
and get some options?

35:08.540 --> 35:09.951
Sure. No problem.

35:10.208 --> 35:14.253
And when we get to wherever we're going,
I'll need a meeting.

35:14.504 --> 35:15.334
Band meeting?

35:16.131 --> 35:18.171
No. You know. A.A.

35:19.719 --> 35:21.343
- Right.
- No problem.

35:26.851 --> 35:30.220
So are you enjoying yourself,
doing wardrobe?

35:30.480 --> 35:35.023
Trying to get Beano to change
his socks? Yeah, I'm mad for it.

35:35.610 --> 35:37.270
Didn't you want to come?

35:37.779 --> 35:39.652
I didn't have much choice.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.028
Mom didn't want to leave me at home.

35:42.283 --> 35:44.442
Afraid of what I might get up to.

35:51.542 --> 35:54.663
America. That was the greatest,
weren't it?

35:54.921 --> 35:56.297
If you say so.

35:56.757 --> 35:59.328
We toured it on the back
of Sonic Handshake.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.173
That was like our Sgt. Pepper.
We were mega.

36:03.554 --> 36:05.048
Hollywood Bowl.

36:06.474 --> 36:08.134
That was a great gig.

36:08.392 --> 36:11.097
We never played the Hollywood Bowl.

36:13.189 --> 36:14.352
Didn't we?

36:16.567 --> 36:19.402
That's one of my
most vivid memories!

36:19.653 --> 36:21.361
And it never happened?

36:26.327 --> 36:28.237
I think this is us!

36:35.962 --> 36:37.242
It's a fucking boat.

36:45.931 --> 36:47.473
Grumbling ulcer.

36:50.102 --> 36:51.929
Torn cartilage.

36:55.981 --> 36:57.607
Dutch curry.

37:08.161 --> 37:10.996
My God!
It's Night of the Living Dead 2.

37:11.248 --> 37:14.699
I'll get some of them organ
donor cards. I'll be back.

37:14.959 --> 37:16.417
Sorry.

37:18.254 --> 37:20.081
And where's Tony?

37:20.340 --> 37:22.001
He's throwing up.

37:23.094 --> 37:25.845
- This place is a shithole.
- It's a happening shithole.

37:26.054 --> 37:29.922
Tell him that we started out
in places like this.

37:30.185 --> 37:33.470
He didn't. He waltzed in
when we were number one.

37:33.730 --> 37:36.516
It was all white wine
and chicken wings in the dressing room.

37:36.773 --> 37:40.819
Is that your idea of the highlife?
Warm bottle of Blue Nun?

37:41.070 --> 37:44.071
Actually, I prefer
a very dry Montrachet.

37:46.366 --> 37:50.116
If you spy any toothsome strumps,
bring them around.

37:50.371 --> 37:52.660
- Not my job.
- It always was!

37:56.834 --> 37:58.709
You are the man, Ray.

37:59.296 --> 38:01.004
You are the man.

38:01.631 --> 38:02.830
You are the man.

38:03.341 --> 38:05.915
You are the goddamn motherfucking man.

38:06.595 --> 38:08.505
Kick some ass!

38:18.398 --> 38:20.391
Strange Fruit!

38:21.736 --> 38:22.851
Hello, Belgium.

38:23.529 --> 38:25.107
Holland, you prick.

39:17.250 --> 39:19.289
One, two, three!

39:26.176 --> 39:27.754
Fuck me!

39:31.431 --> 39:33.056
I've got me a woman

39:33.642 --> 39:35.302
Twice my height and size

39:35.561 --> 39:39.059
She's a married woman
Comes to see me sometimes

39:39.314 --> 39:41.389
You don't believe I love you

39:41.816 --> 39:42.932
Magic, huh?

39:43.152 --> 39:47.445
Doctors, civil servants, moguls.
They got no idea what it's like.

39:48.114 --> 39:50.154
Stealing

39:52.870 --> 39:55.194
Go and have a word with him.

39:55.872 --> 39:57.034
I'm stealing

39:57.290 --> 40:00.291
Back to my same old used-to-be

40:05.174 --> 40:07.046
I didn't feel like...

40:07.425 --> 40:09.133
...I was happening tonight.

40:09.385 --> 40:11.010
What are you talking about?

40:11.221 --> 40:14.388
- I was shouting, not singing.
- Bollocks!

40:15.016 --> 40:17.139
- You were brilliant.
- Was I?

40:17.393 --> 40:19.137
You were like-

40:20.021 --> 40:21.481
Totally.

40:22.734 --> 40:24.109
Love you, man.

40:25.444 --> 40:27.732
I love you too, Tony.

40:29.155 --> 40:30.947
What do you think, Luke?

40:33.286 --> 40:35.029
I thought we were shit.

40:37.206 --> 40:38.783
Kill that racket.

40:39.416 --> 40:40.283
Come again?

40:42.211 --> 40:44.003
We were totally crap.

40:45.130 --> 40:46.921
Especially on "Heartbreaker. "

40:47.131 --> 40:50.217
- I think we should dump that.
- It's a classic!

40:50.470 --> 40:53.636
Maybe we should agree
what key it's in, then.

40:53.889 --> 40:54.885
- B flat.
- C.

40:55.098 --> 40:57.636
The sound was terrible,
and the stage-

40:57.893 --> 40:59.518
Sit down, Karen.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.141
Band stuff.

41:01.605 --> 41:02.886
Crap?

41:05.567 --> 41:07.524
You got no right in saying that.

41:07.944 --> 41:08.976
Sorry, man.

41:09.237 --> 41:11.645
We've been around the block,
you shit!

41:12.033 --> 41:14.654
We know who we are.
Been Fruits a long time.

41:15.076 --> 41:17.651
You can't go calling us crap!

41:17.956 --> 41:20.281
Listen.
I was out of order.

41:22.126 --> 41:24.118
And we weren't crap.

41:25.463 --> 41:28.215
We were seriously, diabolically...

41:28.717 --> 41:29.879
...shite.

41:44.982 --> 41:46.228
You're right.

42:24.690 --> 42:29.731
Clogface! There's more than 200 people
in here. This is not enough.

42:31.488 --> 42:32.402
Excuse me?

42:32.655 --> 42:35.029
You make me horny.
I'll buy you a drink.

42:35.284 --> 42:38.901
Pay what you owe me
and I'll buy you a drink, arsehole.

42:40.121 --> 42:42.956
Almost sounded like a band
a couple of times.

42:43.166 --> 42:46.120
People are finding their spaces,
you know?

42:46.962 --> 42:48.955
Our lead singer isn't.

42:49.756 --> 42:52.128
Same old fucking poseur.

42:52.467 --> 42:54.710
Only this time,
he doesn't have the chops.

42:54.971 --> 42:56.927
For chrissake, he'll get there.

42:57.181 --> 42:58.555
He should be there.

42:59.474 --> 43:01.715
Even if it's just
a pisshole in Hoogeven.

43:01.976 --> 43:03.257
Groningen.

43:03.521 --> 43:04.895
It's a pisshole in Groningen.

43:05.147 --> 43:07.602
The Hoogeven pisshole is tomorrow.

43:10.777 --> 43:13.150
I remember this old model.

43:18.451 --> 43:20.408
Going to get something to eat?

43:21.078 --> 43:22.324
Got other plans, have you?

43:34.177 --> 43:36.085
You should be so lucky.

43:41.183 --> 43:43.341
Haven't you got washing to collect?

43:44.270 --> 43:45.100
Sorry, Mum.

44:08.210 --> 44:10.120
No problem, mate.

44:10.964 --> 44:12.755
No problem.

44:13.840 --> 44:16.509
Fucking massacre them.

44:17.635 --> 44:20.591
Take no prisoners,
you know what I'm saying?

44:44.289 --> 44:47.540
Zoë Ball here in the Netherlands,
where Blind Fish begins their tour.

44:47.793 --> 44:50.414
Also present,
rock veterans Strange Fruit.

44:50.670 --> 44:52.164
All Over The World, remember?

44:52.422 --> 44:53.832
Ray Simms, you must be a
big follower of the boys.

44:54.090 --> 44:57.044
I got on their vibe
with their first album.

44:57.928 --> 44:58.959
Favorite track?

45:00.180 --> 45:01.460
The third one.

45:03.516 --> 45:07.645
Why do they always assume that
the singer is the voice of the band?

45:07.896 --> 45:09.095
How do you see your career?

45:09.356 --> 45:12.356
When I look at my career,
I feel it's like the universe.

45:12.566 --> 45:14.524
Unfolding on schedule.

45:15.779 --> 45:17.438
Sorry. We'll be back.

45:19.282 --> 45:22.448
- I don't know why we're here.
- Clive wants it.

45:23.119 --> 45:24.745
The Fish are on his label.

45:24.997 --> 45:27.037
We're in the same city.
It's a great P R. op.

45:27.375 --> 45:28.573
How big are these buggers?

45:28.834 --> 45:30.625
They're platinum in the States.

45:30.919 --> 45:33.042
They don't mean shite in my local.

45:42.514 --> 45:45.136
That was worth an hour
on the fucking autobahn.

45:45.393 --> 45:47.681
They need a few minutes. Obviously.

45:47.937 --> 45:51.850
Well, the chances of me
getting a shag around here is slim.

45:52.064 --> 45:53.690
I'm off to the bar.

46:20.844 --> 46:22.220
You okay?

46:24.056 --> 46:25.468
Yeah.

46:26.101 --> 46:27.558
I was, you know...

46:28.560 --> 46:30.767
...feeling a bit fragile.

46:31.564 --> 46:32.809
I needed a meet.

46:34.192 --> 46:36.184
I forgot it'd be in Dutch.

46:37.278 --> 46:39.271
I blew it last night.

46:40.198 --> 46:42.868
I shouldn't have
let Clive talk me into it.

46:44.703 --> 46:47.193
Just seeing them, you know...

46:48.372 --> 46:49.403
...soar...

46:51.250 --> 46:53.243
...it brought it all back.

46:55.004 --> 46:56.202
You know, what we were.

46:56.672 --> 46:58.960
What you'll be again.

47:02.304 --> 47:04.545
I've got a birthday tomorrow.

47:06.181 --> 47:08.340
Do you know how old I'll be?

47:08.558 --> 47:09.389
How old?

47:12.647 --> 47:13.761
Old.

47:18.027 --> 47:20.269
You haven't lost it, Ray.

47:20.530 --> 47:23.365
You need the big stage,
the great arena.

47:23.616 --> 47:25.942
That's the kind of artist you are.

47:28.872 --> 47:29.821
Sorry.

47:32.333 --> 47:33.365
Sorry.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.083
My name's Ray...

47:37.505 --> 47:38.502
...and...

47:39.883 --> 47:41.757
...and I'm an alcoholic.

47:43.219 --> 47:44.334
Alcoholic?

47:45.889 --> 47:47.632
We zijn overeaters.

47:48.934 --> 47:51.056
Dit is Overeaters Anonymous.

47:59.820 --> 48:01.101
Thank you.

48:06.910 --> 48:08.155
It's easy enough.

48:08.411 --> 48:10.203
Just name a band whose name...

48:10.455 --> 48:12.079
...corresponds with a body part.

48:12.332 --> 48:14.574
I'll give you one: The Faces.

48:15.459 --> 48:18.995
- Small Faces.
- Excellent. That's a point to you.

48:19.799 --> 48:21.172
I've got it:

48:21.424 --> 48:22.289
Badfinger.

48:22.508 --> 48:25.046
How about the Stones?
As in "kidney" stones.

48:26.138 --> 48:28.594
Find someone to share
the condom with?

48:30.226 --> 48:32.895
I only had that
out of a professional interest.

48:33.145 --> 48:36.479
- Run that by me again?
- That's what I did in Ibiza.

48:36.733 --> 48:39.650
It's not
something you boast about, but...

48:39.903 --> 48:42.772
...I had the condom concession
for the Balearics.

48:43.030 --> 48:46.399
I personally am in a
state of celibacy at this time.

48:46.658 --> 48:50.323
- It's of no interest to me.
- It obviously is.

48:50.579 --> 48:52.738
If not, you wouldn't be using
that snotty voice.

48:52.956 --> 48:53.787
What snotty voice?

48:54.041 --> 48:56.828
That voice you use on club owners
and waitresses.

48:57.045 --> 48:59.748
Really doesn't bother me,
all right?

49:00.881 --> 49:02.458
Then why did you ask me?

49:08.597 --> 49:10.637
Thumbscrew! First band I was in.

49:10.891 --> 49:13.976
Has to be a band
someone's heard of, Ray.

49:14.395 --> 49:15.427
Bollocks, then.

49:15.688 --> 49:16.969
You get two points for that.

49:17.231 --> 49:18.641
- Spooky Tooth.
- Good.

49:18.898 --> 49:19.929
Talking Heads!

49:20.150 --> 49:22.189
Now we're rolling.
Einsteins, every one.

49:22.402 --> 49:24.526
Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show!

49:26.032 --> 49:27.491
Objection, Your Honor.

49:27.742 --> 49:28.655
Sustained.

49:28.910 --> 49:30.452
Some people have hook
instead of hand.

49:30.703 --> 49:34.287
It's not a part of the body.
It's not anatomical.

49:34.541 --> 49:36.747
It is if you ain't got
a fucking hand.

49:42.715 --> 49:44.838
Only the footlights up first.

49:45.051 --> 49:47.542
When the drums kick in,
everything up.

49:47.804 --> 49:50.175
Hughie, I want to do
"Scream Freedom. "

49:50.431 --> 49:53.766
The way we always did it,
with the amps up full volume.

49:53.977 --> 49:55.352
Full? In this wee place?

49:55.603 --> 49:58.557
Karen feels I need scale.
What do you think?

49:58.814 --> 50:01.187
Sure, go for it.

50:01.442 --> 50:03.400
"Scream Freedom. "

50:12.537 --> 50:16.534
And the flame still burns

50:20.127 --> 50:21.788
It's there in my soul

50:23.547 --> 50:25.422
For that unfinished goal

50:26.718 --> 50:30.633
And the flame still burns

50:33.934 --> 50:35.557
From a glimmer, back then

50:37.186 --> 50:38.895
It lights up again

50:40.524 --> 50:41.722
In my life

50:48.615 --> 50:49.991
It's a good song.

50:50.326 --> 50:51.785
"The Flame Still Burns. "

50:52.036 --> 50:54.276
Les and Brian wrote it
after Keith's death.

50:54.537 --> 50:55.450
Why don't they play it?

50:56.455 --> 50:58.745
You're in murky waters there.

50:59.001 --> 51:01.622
For a while, Les stood in
as the lead singer.

51:01.878 --> 51:04.796
But he was never a frontman.
It was obvious to everybody.

51:06.174 --> 51:07.799
Is that why he's got it in for Ray?

51:08.010 --> 51:10.086
The song always meant
a great deal to Les...

51:10.346 --> 51:12.836
...but he always hated
the way Ray did it.

51:13.139 --> 51:15.262
Ray wouldn't let
anybody else do the lead...

51:15.517 --> 51:17.889
...so they stopped doing it forever.

51:18.144 --> 51:21.514
All part of the weird shit
that's the history of the Fruits.

51:22.107 --> 51:24.146
It'd be cool to see
them make it again.

51:25.902 --> 51:28.146
We wait with bated breath.

51:29.491 --> 51:34.151
Sounds a bit grandiose to me,
dry ice in a place like this.

51:34.411 --> 51:38.908
I saw a rat when I was taking a leak.
You don't get that in Albert Hall.

51:39.166 --> 51:42.500
- Les hates "Scream Freedom. "
- I don't give a flying dog's bollock.

51:42.753 --> 51:46.206
I've been doing this for years.
He's been whistling up a ladder.

51:46.424 --> 51:50.089
It's full and noisy. Lots of
headbangers. Rough crowd.

51:50.344 --> 51:53.178
Maybe we should cut
the Joni Mitchell tribute.

51:53.471 --> 51:55.179
- Any sign of Astrid?
- Not yet.

52:03.732 --> 52:04.847
Fuck.

52:07.195 --> 52:10.776
Tokyo, 23,000 people.
Anaheim, 44,000 people.

52:11.031 --> 52:13.901
Dallas, 67,000 people!

52:14.158 --> 52:16.781
And you bring me headbangers!

53:23.772 --> 53:24.887
Oh, go home!

53:47.378 --> 53:49.122
Forget this, man.

53:49.798 --> 53:51.791
It's supposed to be rock 'n' roll!

53:52.050 --> 53:55.135
Not the Phantom
of the fucking Opera!

54:06.356 --> 54:09.524
I know what you're up to.
I've known it since day one.

54:09.776 --> 54:12.315
I can feel your eyes on me
every time I'm onstage.

54:12.571 --> 54:17.197
Why can't you just get your notes right
and remember the lyrics?

54:17.450 --> 54:19.942
I hate your fucking lyrics!

54:20.245 --> 54:23.696
They're not meaningful poetry
like Brian's, right?

54:24.624 --> 54:28.920
For him, the music was enough.
Before the hair and the limos.

54:29.172 --> 54:32.622
All I remember about Brian
is missed cues, missed gigs...

54:32.884 --> 54:34.792
...brother OD'd in a Little Chef.

54:35.052 --> 54:37.545
You worshiped the ground he vomited on.

54:37.806 --> 54:40.676
It's not because they're great.
It's because they're dead!

54:41.518 --> 54:44.221
Maybe if I was dead,
I'd get some respect.

54:44.436 --> 54:45.635
It would be a start.

54:52.486 --> 54:54.110
I'm not fifty.

54:54.906 --> 54:56.983
I'm not fifty!

55:03.872 --> 55:05.070
Back off!

55:05.624 --> 55:07.867
You got a problem, pick on me.

55:11.922 --> 55:12.953
Where's Ray?

55:13.215 --> 55:14.758
No one's seen him.

55:14.967 --> 55:16.545
He's doing one of his moodies.

55:16.802 --> 55:19.175
Don't go after him,
that's what he wants.

55:19.430 --> 55:23.177
- Hope this isn't another Sunderland.
- What happened in Sunderland?

55:23.433 --> 55:26.221
He tried to slash his wrists
with my Swiss Army knife.

55:26.437 --> 55:27.766
He couldn't find the blade.

55:28.023 --> 55:30.395
This could be serious.
He's on Prozac.

55:30.609 --> 55:33.894
Prozac and alfalfa sprouts?
That could be lethal.

55:37.992 --> 55:40.778
I love playing the guitar,
you know?

55:42.203 --> 55:44.659
Ain't much joy
for me here tonight.

55:45.082 --> 55:47.703
I think I'll retire to my boudoir...

55:47.917 --> 55:50.076
...if the youngsters
will keep the noise down.

55:50.337 --> 55:52.792
Hell, you sound like their father.

55:53.048 --> 55:55.621
Might be.
We toured here 20 years ago.

55:55.884 --> 55:57.960
And I know I had a shag then.

55:58.302 --> 56:00.129
Know what your problem is?

56:00.387 --> 56:03.058
You see yourself
as keeper of the flame.

56:03.267 --> 56:05.258
All these reasons
for your anger.

56:05.477 --> 56:07.469
Ray's style, Ray's taste,
Ray's lyrics.

56:07.937 --> 56:09.561
His shoes piss me off.

56:09.814 --> 56:12.269
You had your shot.
You couldn't hack it.

56:12.526 --> 56:14.317
Dearie me, trouble in paradise?

56:14.570 --> 56:16.361
Fuck off, Hughie!

56:16.697 --> 56:18.818
Why'd you come on this ride?

56:19.573 --> 56:22.659
Just to watch us
bollix it all up again?

56:23.494 --> 56:26.910
Maybe the antique trade's
slow this time of year.

56:27.123 --> 56:28.583
Blood, Sweat and Tears!

56:29.168 --> 56:29.997
What?

56:30.711 --> 56:32.372
Name of a band.
Parts of the body.

56:33.089 --> 56:34.667
Triple whammy, right?

56:37.384 --> 56:39.091
The woman from the tax!

56:39.344 --> 56:41.836
I thought I saw her at the gig.

56:44.016 --> 56:46.637
- I want to go home. I'm sick of it.
- Not now.

56:46.851 --> 56:49.010
But this is stupid!

56:49.437 --> 56:50.553
Why don't we just pack it in?

56:50.815 --> 56:51.978
What's he saying?

56:52.191 --> 56:54.267
He wants the police
to impound your bus!

56:54.485 --> 56:58.316
Tell him we're well-established
on the British music scene...

56:58.571 --> 57:01.028
...and will live up
to their obligations.

57:01.659 --> 57:04.575
Why don't you live up to yours
and get us out of here?

57:07.872 --> 57:10.626
This isn't about me,
it's about him.

57:23.305 --> 57:26.223
Hey, Fruit. Want to get high?

57:30.188 --> 57:31.563
What you...

57:31.981 --> 57:33.061
No, I...

57:36.318 --> 57:38.026
What you got?

57:38.655 --> 57:41.655
You want to go up,
or you want to go down?

57:41.866 --> 57:43.657
Down. Definitely...

57:44.869 --> 57:46.113
...down.

57:52.627 --> 57:54.168
I heard you were here.

57:54.753 --> 57:55.951
You okay?

57:56.213 --> 57:58.206
No, not really, no.

57:59.425 --> 58:03.090
They want to hold the bus
till I get money wired for damages.

58:04.514 --> 58:06.638
What made me think I could do this?

58:06.892 --> 58:10.260
It's only you who's
held us together this long.

58:13.397 --> 58:16.933
You're going to need some help.
Financial.

58:17.901 --> 58:19.776
I want you to have this.

58:22.072 --> 58:25.857
No. This is your fallback,
your rainy day.

58:26.078 --> 58:27.452
It's yours now.

58:29.373 --> 58:31.115
Where's the tooth?

58:31.373 --> 58:33.947
Oh, shit. Oh, no! Where is it?

58:34.210 --> 58:36.084
- So tiny...
- Bollocks!

58:42.552 --> 58:44.794
Hold on, man! Quick, quick!

58:46.974 --> 58:47.969
Stop!

58:49.310 --> 58:54.434
Stop! You're about to violate
a piece of rock 'n' roll history!

59:04.909 --> 59:07.067
"They called him
the Prince of Darkness.

59:08.412 --> 59:11.827
And he ruled the Zuider Zee.

59:13.625 --> 59:15.333
And he had one mantra-"

59:20.549 --> 59:22.874
Bugger me.

59:27.847 --> 59:29.009
There we are.

59:33.270 --> 59:34.681
Bollocks.

59:41.195 --> 59:42.690
Fuck. Oh, no.

59:46.200 --> 59:49.070
Oh, no, no! Help, somebody!

59:50.036 --> 59:52.528
Jesus! Help! Somebody!

59:53.165 --> 59:54.446
Help!

59:55.334 --> 59:56.828
Oh, my God!

59:57.086 --> 59:59.411
Stay there! I'm coming!

01:00:19.233 --> 01:00:20.811
Oh, my God!

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:25.687
Somebody!

01:00:33.915 --> 01:00:35.325
Somebody...

01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.127
Oh, God!

01:00:55.811 --> 01:00:57.092
For God's sake, grab this!

01:00:58.857 --> 01:00:59.806
Pull!

01:01:04.945 --> 01:01:07.401
I think I had a near-death experience.

01:01:07.699 --> 01:01:10.451
It was almost a full-death experience.

01:01:10.701 --> 01:01:13.026
- I slipped.
- You're on a frozen canal.

01:01:13.287 --> 01:01:18.199
The tragedy for people like me is
our lives peak too early.

01:01:18.460 --> 01:01:19.373
Tragedy?

01:01:20.003 --> 01:01:24.213
Famine's a tragedy, Ray.
Or knocking down the rainforests.

01:01:24.465 --> 01:01:28.961
Anyway, some people's lives
never peak. Think about it.

01:01:29.387 --> 01:01:31.096
Happy birthday, by the way.

01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:32.427
I'm not fifty.

01:01:32.974 --> 01:01:34.516
Bollocks!

01:01:35.018 --> 01:01:37.937
Maybe it wasn't his tooth, anyway.

01:01:39.439 --> 01:01:43.389
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:01:44.027 --> 01:01:46.732
I'd do anything for you,
you know that?

01:01:47.656 --> 01:01:51.440
If you weren't so hung up on Brian,
I'd have married you years ago.

01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.617
I told you once. Remember?
In Detroit.

01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:56.327
- No, it was Cardiff.
- Close.

01:01:56.582 --> 01:01:57.578
Brian-

01:01:59.917 --> 01:02:00.913
Tony.

01:02:04.714 --> 01:02:06.754
Let's get back to the hotel.

01:02:14.057 --> 01:02:16.845
Why are you still chasing ghosts?

01:02:24.902 --> 01:02:26.182
Can you move?

01:02:32.034 --> 01:02:35.238
I am at Amsterdam at 3:00!
There is no limo.

01:02:35.455 --> 01:02:38.123
I wait an hour.
I don't know who to call!

01:02:38.415 --> 01:02:40.621
I get train to this terrible place!

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:44.744
The taxi driver's a fool!
He has not heard about the club.

01:02:45.005 --> 01:02:47.544
I have to tell you,
I'm bloody pissed off!

01:02:53.806 --> 01:02:55.431
Hello, baby.

01:02:55.683 --> 01:02:57.675
I'm okay now, thank you.

01:02:58.018 --> 01:02:59.299
Hello, baby.

01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:02.097
- What's happening?
- What happened to you?

01:03:02.314 --> 01:03:04.106
What have you taken?

01:03:04.358 --> 01:03:05.983
I love you, Momma.

01:03:08.529 --> 01:03:09.394
My God!

01:03:19.331 --> 01:03:20.160
What?

01:03:20.415 --> 01:03:23.998
Cockney Rebel! "Cock" and "knee, "
bonus points for that one.

01:03:24.253 --> 01:03:25.712
Who is this?

01:03:27.047 --> 01:03:28.589
Bastard!

01:03:29.633 --> 01:03:31.675
Sorry about that, darling.

01:03:39.185 --> 01:03:40.894
Who the fuck is this?

01:03:41.145 --> 01:03:42.973
Sorry, boss. I mean Karen.

01:03:43.231 --> 01:03:46.398
- Get your socks on. We're leaving.
- What? Now?!

01:03:57.119 --> 01:03:58.947
Come on, Tony-boy!

01:04:00.915 --> 01:04:02.030
Here we go!

01:04:04.168 --> 01:04:05.711
Easy, now!

01:04:09.091 --> 01:04:10.122
Here we go!

01:04:25.482 --> 01:04:28.103
Was this your tooth, Tony?

01:04:30.278 --> 01:04:32.153
Hilarious, Beano.

01:04:33.489 --> 01:04:35.529
Fucking hilarious.

01:04:44.335 --> 01:04:45.414
Hello, man.

01:04:47.047 --> 01:04:48.374
About last night...

01:04:49.215 --> 01:04:50.840
It's a heavy thought that...

01:04:51.175 --> 01:04:53.213
...I drove you to do
something that desperate.

01:04:54.094 --> 01:04:54.923
What?

01:04:57.014 --> 01:04:59.090
Well, you know, man.

01:04:59.475 --> 01:05:02.345
A dark night of the soul, I suppose.

01:05:02.686 --> 01:05:04.228
Yeah, well.

01:05:05.523 --> 01:05:08.440
There's maybe some things
I shouldn't have said.

01:05:09.193 --> 01:05:11.101
Shouldn't have said them
20 years ago.

01:05:11.361 --> 01:05:13.152
He says he's a very bastard pig.

01:05:15.199 --> 01:05:18.650
Does Les think
Ray was trying to kill himself?

01:05:19.328 --> 01:05:22.743
I may have given him
that impression, yes.

01:05:23.665 --> 01:05:26.453
Best for the band, I thought.

01:05:31.088 --> 01:05:32.500
You should know this.

01:05:33.133 --> 01:05:34.794
Last night...

01:05:35.136 --> 01:05:37.674
...as the icy waters closed over me...

01:05:39.098 --> 01:05:40.675
...I saw Brian.

01:05:45.189 --> 01:05:47.227
What was he wearing?

01:05:47.607 --> 01:05:49.266
I don't remember.

01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:51.731
But I saw him so clearly.

01:05:52.569 --> 01:05:56.022
Maybe he was on some
astral travel trip.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:06:00.024
I don't know,
but he was sending a message.

01:06:00.786 --> 01:06:03.741
And the message was positive, man.

01:06:27.771 --> 01:06:31.853
Better call the club.
Tell them we might not make it.

01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:34.737
The fates have conspired against us.

01:06:34.946 --> 01:06:37.069
It was that
old Scottish phrase again:

01:06:37.282 --> 01:06:40.699
- "If you don't succeed... "
- "... pull your foreskin over your head. "

01:06:40.953 --> 01:06:43.241
Is that how you all feel?
Is it?

01:06:43.497 --> 01:06:45.488
If it is,
we can all piss off home...

01:06:45.832 --> 01:06:48.120
...and get on
with the rest of our lives.

01:06:49.543 --> 01:06:51.122
Excuse me.

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:53.871
You go, maybe, to Antwerp?

01:06:55.091 --> 01:06:57.629
Hasn't been decided yet, my lovely.

01:07:01.932 --> 01:07:03.890
Where did you get that T-shirt?

01:07:04.142 --> 01:07:06.846
This? It belonged my father.

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:08.301
Look at that.

01:07:11.691 --> 01:07:13.684
Must've been through the wash
a few times.

01:07:13.985 --> 01:07:15.444
My father, he died.

01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:17.859
- Sorry.
- That's a shitter.

01:07:18.114 --> 01:07:19.941
They were his favorite band.

01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:23.367
He say, best band he ever saw.

01:07:23.911 --> 01:07:25.654
It's another sign.

01:07:27.123 --> 01:07:28.404
Brian sent her.

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.995
Thank you, Brian.

01:08:54.129 --> 01:08:55.372
Band sounds good.

01:08:56.048 --> 01:08:57.127
Wicked!

01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:58.810
Excuse me!

01:10:04.115 --> 01:10:06.986
Get lost, you slut!
He's mine!

01:10:55.208 --> 01:10:56.488
I love you!

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:09.385
A week later, a record deal.
Straight into the studio.

01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:11.929
And Ray let Les sing!

01:11:12.183 --> 01:11:14.721
Just one song,
but on the scale of miracles...

01:11:14.978 --> 01:11:18.348
...this rated at a level
with the Immaculate Conception.

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:59.681
Zoë Ball's program's on.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:01.524
In a minute.
There's money on this.

01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:06.190
I also caught up with
seminal 70s rockers, Strange Fruit.

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:08.488
Why play
such down-and-out venues?

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:11.156
This tour, we wanted to be...

01:12:11.410 --> 01:12:16.203
...more grassroots, you know,
with the audience right in your face.

01:12:16.791 --> 01:12:18.748
As a band, do you miss Brian?

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:21.285
If you want my opinion...

01:12:21.670 --> 01:12:24.163
...Brian Lovell
was as near to a genius...

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:26.631
...as you can get in this business.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:27.999
Don't remember this.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:30.087
You'd left.
She got them tanked up.

01:12:30.303 --> 01:12:32.343
People who remember the Fruits...

01:12:32.598 --> 01:12:35.007
...remember Keith and Brian.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:39.517
They don't remember Wicksey,
Ray, or me.

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:44.186
Except maybe when I fell off
the stage once, pissed as a bollock.

01:12:44.445 --> 01:12:48.905
No use kidding yourself we're
Strange Fruit, because we ain't.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:51.778
Not with Brian and Keith ten feet under.

01:12:52.119 --> 01:12:53.992
You dickhead, Beano!

01:12:54.246 --> 01:12:58.706
Maybe if we was to call ourselves
"Slightly Strange Fruit. "

01:12:58.958 --> 01:13:01.712
Or how about
"Fairly Ordinary Fruit"?

01:13:01.962 --> 01:13:05.082
Or "Canned Fruit. " I'm canned.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.048
Don't know about you.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:11.125
Ray, come here!

01:13:12.514 --> 01:13:14.756
- You fucking assholes!
- Hey!

01:13:14.975 --> 01:13:17.051
This is set point!

01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:21.095
- What's rattled your eyeliner?
- You two crapped all over this band!

01:13:23.734 --> 01:13:25.560
- That's enough!
- Get off me!

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.529
I'm sorry.

01:13:29.781 --> 01:13:31.156
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

01:13:36.748 --> 01:13:38.241
Leave it!

01:13:41.128 --> 01:13:44.910
You'll be hitting each other
with your handbags next.

01:13:45.172 --> 01:13:48.256
You never forgave me
for taking over from Keith!

01:13:49.969 --> 01:13:51.167
Well...

01:13:51.805 --> 01:13:55.008
...you can find yourself
another fucking singer.

01:14:02.857 --> 01:14:04.398
For chrissake!

01:14:05.609 --> 01:14:07.068
This was about us.

01:14:07.318 --> 01:14:09.193
This was our second shot.

01:14:10.114 --> 01:14:13.150
And it was working.
Anybody who was at Antwerp saw it.

01:14:13.409 --> 01:14:18.486
We were brilliant, better than
we ever were. We were a great band!

01:14:18.915 --> 01:14:20.788
Stupid bastards!
Why couldn't you...

01:14:21.042 --> 01:14:23.413
...bury the past before it buried us?

01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:14.835
Ironically...

01:15:15.097 --> 01:15:19.225
...a week later was the 25th
anniversary of Keith's death.

01:15:19.434 --> 01:15:22.184
Because she didn't
have a grave for Brian...

01:15:22.436 --> 01:15:24.560
...Karen went to pay her respects.

01:15:25.065 --> 01:15:27.104
God, look at them all!

01:15:28.818 --> 01:15:31.356
This one's written in Dutch.
Look!

01:15:37.662 --> 01:15:40.578
"Even after all this time,
the flame still burns.

01:15:40.830 --> 01:15:43.237
Love you, man. Brian. "

01:15:49.256 --> 01:15:50.999
Where is he, Hughie?

01:15:51.675 --> 01:15:53.467
He's alive, isn't he?

01:15:55.763 --> 01:15:58.514
We went to the cemetery.
He sent flowers.

01:15:58.723 --> 01:16:01.179
Probably a fan
with a twisted sense of humor.

01:16:01.392 --> 01:16:04.809
Or you, looking after him
like you always did.

01:16:05.439 --> 01:16:08.808
I thought he was dead!
Why did you put me through that?

01:16:09.443 --> 01:16:12.065
- I love the wee guy.
- You're not the only one.

01:16:12.279 --> 01:16:16.194
When he came back from the States,
he was a basket case.

01:16:16.409 --> 01:16:20.405
I couldn't let him go through
all that shit again.

01:16:20.662 --> 01:16:23.284
Maybe it wouldn't have been
all that shit again.

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:28.167
But wasn't it? There's no blinding
flash on the road to Damascus.

01:16:28.378 --> 01:16:31.879
Listen, Hughie.
The guys don't deserve this.

01:16:32.091 --> 01:16:33.834
You saw how close they were.

01:16:34.343 --> 01:16:37.047
- You were there.
- Did you tell him?

01:16:37.429 --> 01:16:38.592
How good they were?

01:16:39.848 --> 01:16:41.842
As a matter of fact, I did.

01:16:42.102 --> 01:16:44.639
I even let him hear a couple of tracks.

01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:50.610
- You'll find him just over there.
- Thanks.

01:16:58.658 --> 01:17:01.067
Maybe you should talk to him first.

01:17:45.123 --> 01:17:48.410
I was trying to picture
what you would look like.

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.003
Still look like yourself.

01:17:54.465 --> 01:17:56.043
You don't look much different.

01:17:57.385 --> 01:17:58.500
A few more lines.

01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:01.304
Less than you deserve.

01:18:04.433 --> 01:18:06.344
How long have you been working here?

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:08.477
Since I stopped being a patient.

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.358
Kind of handy if I have a relapse.

01:18:14.109 --> 01:18:15.854
But you're fine now, yeah?

01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:18.485
Tchaikovsky, when conducting...

01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.860
...used to cradle a hand on his head.

01:18:22.118 --> 01:18:24.574
He thought it might fall off.

01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:28.249
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.083
Is that how you felt?

01:18:31.752 --> 01:18:33.994
Is that why
you gave your royalties away?

01:18:34.798 --> 01:18:35.913
No.

01:18:38.469 --> 01:18:41.469
The only way I could get away
from the life I had...

01:18:41.764 --> 01:18:44.052
...was to start again with a new one.

01:18:47.895 --> 01:18:49.472
Do you like my garden?

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:51.476
It's beautiful.

01:18:51.731 --> 01:18:53.012
I write songs here.

01:18:53.483 --> 01:18:54.397
Yeah!

01:18:54.652 --> 01:18:59.360
I've got over a hundred of them
in a Sainsbury's plastic bag.

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:08.699
Did you play the Fruits' tracks?

01:19:10.333 --> 01:19:15.328
Too much reverb for my taste,
but they were definitely happening.

01:19:16.298 --> 01:19:17.673
They missed you.

01:19:18.509 --> 01:19:20.133
I miss them.

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:28.884
Anything in the rules
says I can't give you a hug?

01:19:30.019 --> 01:19:31.812
I don't think so.

01:20:01.178 --> 01:20:04.713
Why did you leave me
all those years ago?

01:20:10.353 --> 01:20:12.511
I didn't want to watch you die.

01:20:40.175 --> 01:20:41.884
The house has much history.

01:20:42.136 --> 01:20:45.503
Queen Victoria slept here,
and so did Steve Winwood.

01:20:50.811 --> 01:20:52.222
You cannot see Ray.

01:20:52.479 --> 01:20:55.645
He don't want to see you
bloody people again.

01:20:55.858 --> 01:20:56.972
That's nice.

01:20:58.194 --> 01:20:59.937
He'll see me.

01:21:02.238 --> 01:21:03.732
Brian, careful!

01:21:44.365 --> 01:21:47.531
I can see you, Brian.
So clearly.

01:21:48.494 --> 01:21:50.451
Do you have a message?

01:21:51.622 --> 01:21:53.579
Got a gig on Saturday, man.

01:21:56.044 --> 01:21:57.241
What?

01:21:57.504 --> 01:22:02.460
A record number of people, maybe
200,000. Wisbech is happening!

01:22:06.137 --> 01:22:07.465
Great to see you.

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.465
This is a great thrill for me.

01:22:09.724 --> 01:22:10.755
Brian Lovell?

01:22:11.016 --> 01:22:14.516
I'm pleased the rumors
of your demise were premature.

01:22:14.729 --> 01:22:17.481
I hope we're on
after Mott the Hoople this time.

01:22:17.690 --> 01:22:20.643
- After Mott and Little Feat.
- Little Feet, one point.

01:22:23.154 --> 01:22:24.316
Questions, please.

01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:26.114
So which Fruit's which?

01:22:26.782 --> 01:22:29.355
I'm Posh Fruit.
Les is Sour Fruit.

01:22:29.619 --> 01:22:32.654
Ray's the one with money.
He's Bread Fruit.

01:22:32.914 --> 01:22:35.583
What does that make you, Brian?
Bruised fruit?

01:22:35.916 --> 01:22:37.956
Brian, 20 years ago you said...

01:22:38.210 --> 01:22:41.330
..."I'll never walk on stage
with the Fruits again. "

01:22:41.589 --> 01:22:42.669
How do you feel about that now?

01:22:44.050 --> 01:22:46.837
Since when did anyone
believe what they read?

01:22:47.095 --> 01:22:51.389
Any new material on the tour,
or just golden oldies?

01:22:53.768 --> 01:22:55.596
Any punch-ups on the tour?

01:22:55.854 --> 01:22:58.973
- It was sweetness and light.
- Very mellow vibe.

01:23:10.118 --> 01:23:11.494
Oh, fuck!

01:23:11.787 --> 01:23:16.115
Did you plant the story of
Brian's death as a publicity stunt?

01:23:16.331 --> 01:23:17.162
Of course not.

01:23:17.416 --> 01:23:21.284
There are questions about your life.
Wasn't the pressure too much?

01:23:21.546 --> 01:23:23.539
Was that when you lost your plot?

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:26.799
- Were you in a mental home?
- Or in a clinic?

01:23:27.051 --> 01:23:30.966
- You used to be a patient-
- One question at a time, please.

01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:36.304
Was the breakdown chemically induced,
or brought about by Keith's death?

01:23:41.191 --> 01:23:42.353
Can you answer?

01:23:42.568 --> 01:23:43.599
Let's go. Come on.

01:23:43.944 --> 01:23:48.072
- You called a press conference!
- You've got a responsibility to answer.

01:23:48.324 --> 01:23:50.032
Are you going to answer?

01:23:50.284 --> 01:23:51.944
We need pictures, guys!

01:23:52.161 --> 01:23:53.489
You people are really something!

01:23:53.704 --> 01:23:58.164
All you want is a few free drinks
and a chance to tear people down.

01:23:58.458 --> 01:24:00.784
Those guys deserve
a bit more respect.

01:24:03.046 --> 01:24:05.418
You bunch of wankers!

01:24:12.431 --> 01:24:15.596
Find Beano, love.
I want everyone to hear this.

01:24:15.809 --> 01:24:17.183
Hear what?

01:24:18.729 --> 01:24:20.520
Brian's not going on.

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:24.433
We knew it might happen.

01:24:24.693 --> 01:24:26.685
With or without him, you'll be okay.

01:24:26.946 --> 01:24:31.157
He just feels he could do
without all that flack again, you know.

01:24:38.583 --> 01:24:40.042
Mr. Baggot!

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:45.088
Who are you?

01:24:49.677 --> 01:24:51.550
You were in the first band I ever saw.

01:24:51.845 --> 01:24:55.095
My father banned me from
seeing a rock concert again.

01:24:55.307 --> 01:24:56.137
He was a Methodist.

01:24:57.936 --> 01:25:01.470
- So what do you want from me?
- Quick, violent sex.

01:25:10.281 --> 01:25:13.067
You're not from
the Inland Revenue, then?

01:25:19.081 --> 01:25:21.488
What can I tell you?
I'm minus a drummer.

01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:26.045
Don't pull this stroke on me.
You're not going on after Quo.

01:25:26.297 --> 01:25:28.089
If you don't go on now,
they'll get ugly.

01:25:28.341 --> 01:25:30.214
Listen, they're baying for our blood.

01:25:30.467 --> 01:25:34.548
Let's find another drummer.
There's got to be a dozen here.

01:25:34.763 --> 01:25:38.263
- Thank you very much for the loyalty.
- Where have you been?

01:25:38.475 --> 01:25:43.388
- It doesn't matter. Are you okay?
- I'm very okay, as a matter of fact.

01:25:43.649 --> 01:25:45.227
Shall we do this then?

01:25:45.484 --> 01:25:48.733
All right, let's go.
Come on! Let's go, Fruits!

01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:51.477
Okay, everyone, it's been far too long.

01:25:51.739 --> 01:25:56.153
So let me hear you give a great welcome
to Strange Fruit!

01:27:03.938 --> 01:27:05.182
Come on!

01:27:40.767 --> 01:27:41.681
Go on!

01:27:44.728 --> 01:27:46.520
"The Flame Still Burns. "

01:27:58.952 --> 01:28:00.197
What key are we in?

01:28:00.453 --> 01:28:01.781
E. B.

01:30:33.857 --> 01:30:35.481
Don't you dare.

01:30:45.244 --> 01:30:46.738
I was wrong about God.

01:30:46.954 --> 01:30:49.743
Turns out He likes
that 70s stuff after all.

01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:53.664
So it didn't piss down,
and they played four encores.

01:30:53.919 --> 01:30:57.918
And with the Almighty in their corner,
who knows what might happen?

01:30:58.174 --> 01:31:02.753
And how will the Fruits conspire
to bollix things up this time around?

01:31:03.012 --> 01:31:05.716
We wait with bated breath.

01:35:24.193 --> 01:35:28.321
I've got one. Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers.

01:35:28.530 --> 01:35:32.907
Here, I had one with "heart. "
Gerry and the Pacemakers.
