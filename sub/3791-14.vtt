01:17.619 --> 01:20.747
Hey guys, it's Amanda...
again.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.915
Have we thought any more
about the Sam Mendes movie?

01:23.000 --> 01:24.459
He's called four times.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.753
I need an answer, so please
please call me back.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.755
It's her fourth call.
What do you wanna do?

01:28.839 --> 01:31.090
Call her back...
when we have an answer.

01:31.175 --> 01:32.842
Now let's talk
about the trip.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.178
- What about it?
- Just tell me why you hate Michelle.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.513
I don't hate Michelle. I just don't
wanna travel with her again.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.307
- Why?
- Why?

01:39.600 --> 01:42.226
Yeah, why? We didn't have
a great time in Tahoe?

01:42.311 --> 01:44.854
No, we didn't. She walked around
the condo naked the whole time, Vince,

01:44.938 --> 01:46.189
made Sloan totally
uncomfortable.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.524
- Sloan said she was uncomfortable?
- She didn't have to say it.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.152
It was obvious when she wanted to eat
all of our meals in the bedroom.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.946
- Okay, fine. I'll find someone else.
- No...

01:54.031 --> 01:55.990
you're not just gonna
find someone else, okay?

01:56.074 --> 01:58.284
Travel compatibility's
the most important part of a trip.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.953
I'll find someone
good to go, I promise.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.122
Go where?
- Yeah, where are we going?

02:03.207 --> 02:04.791
We're not
going anywhere.

02:04.875 --> 02:06.501
Vince?

02:06.585 --> 02:08.461
We're going up to Napa.
It's a couples weekend.

02:08.544 --> 02:10.505
- But you ain't a couple, Vin.
- I'm working on it.

02:10.589 --> 02:13.007
You're going to wine country,
and we're not invited?

02:13.383 --> 02:14.383
What the fuck?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.344
You know what, Drama?
Don't even worry about it.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.720
With Mom and Dad gone,

02:17.805 --> 02:19.680
we'll have the entire house
to ourselves for our bitches.

02:19.765 --> 02:21.641
- True.
- What bitches do you have, Turtle?

02:21.725 --> 02:24.477
We don't have them yet,
but we will by day's end, trust me.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.313
We're going to the Laurel Canyon
dog park.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.774
- What's over there?
- "LA Magazine"

02:29.858 --> 02:32.109
picked it as the hottest spot
in the city to pick up girls.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.986
Ah, that's why Arnold
looks so spiffy.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.279
You know it, baby.

02:35.364 --> 02:36.364
You guys should have
groomed yourselves.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.992
Please, E, in certain cultures
it's illegal to look this good.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.869
You're a regular
fucking felony, Drama.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.038
- Later.
- Come on, boy.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.754
- It's Amanda.
- Mmm-mm-mmm.

02:55.259 --> 02:56.801
There he is,
back from the wars.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.553
Hey, Ari!
- Love it.

03:01.056 --> 03:03.516
Tell Jason I need
that call, all right?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.644
Remind her.
Lloyd, don't fill up.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.771
I'm taking you to the Grill
for lunch today.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.360
Really?
Am I getting promoted?

03:14.444 --> 03:17.071
Don't be ridiculous.
You've been on my desk for 16 months.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.781
It's gonna be
at least another 24.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.368
- 24?
- Sacrifice, Lloyd.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.912
Like the kamikaze pilots
used to do, all right?

03:25.581 --> 03:28.541
Today you're gonna learn
how to sign a client.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.126
Oh... oh, exciting.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.919
- Who is it?
- Jay Lester.

03:32.004 --> 03:34.171
- The TV writer?
- The syndication machine.

03:34.256 --> 03:37.425
Fuck actors!
Too much heartache.

03:37.509 --> 03:41.387
You sign Jim Carrey so you can get
the guy that created Drew Carey.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.931
Right? Jay fired
his agency yesterday,

03:44.016 --> 03:45.933
and we have
to nail this guy.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.645
- S-so why am I going?
- Because he's a queen, just like you.

03:49.813 --> 03:52.398
He's never had a straight agent,
and if I'm going to be his first,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.650
I have to show him
that I am a friend to the gay man.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.237
But you're not a friend
to the gay man, Ari.

03:58.322 --> 03:59.739
Lloyd, this is the big one.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.116
So just go grab your best dress,
and know that today

04:02.200 --> 04:04.452
your love of cock is
a huge asset to this company.

04:09.833 --> 04:13.502
You're mad.
- I'm not mad. I'm surprised.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.588
I thought you wanted
to go away alone with me.

04:15.672 --> 04:17.757
- I did. I do.
- So what happened?

04:17.841 --> 04:19.341
Vince kind
of invited himself.

04:19.426 --> 04:20.927
I didn't wanna
insult him.

04:21.094 --> 04:23.429
Babe, I doubt Vince
is that sensitive.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.056
Oh, yes he is,
trust me,

04:25.140 --> 04:26.849
especially when
it comes to trips.

04:26.934 --> 04:29.101
When we were kids,
I never took one without him.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.228
My dad took us
to Epcot Center,

04:31.313 --> 04:33.105
Vince was there;

04:33.190 --> 04:35.274
Busch Gardens, Vince was there;

04:35.359 --> 04:37.401
Old Williamsburg,
Vince was there...

04:37.527 --> 04:40.029
and trust me, nobody wants to go
to Williamsburg.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.822
The guy, he gets
separation anxiety.

04:41.907 --> 04:44.492
He freaks out if I'm more than
100 miles away from him.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.535
I think it's mutual.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.871
- Oh, you do?
- Yup.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.456
You're a little
Vince's boy.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.792
What are you saying,
I don't wanna go away with you?

04:52.876 --> 04:54.251
I don't know.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.047
- What are you doing?
- Making sure you do know.

04:58.382 --> 05:01.175
Vince, let's grab
a coffee.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.094
You're so tough.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.652
Wow.
All these years,

05:19.736 --> 05:21.988
I been wondering where
girls hide during the day.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.490
Well, let's make up
for lost time, shall we?

05:24.574 --> 05:26.659
All right.
What do you say we start

05:26.743 --> 05:29.036
with Little Miss Fluffy-White-Poodle
over there?

05:29.496 --> 05:31.080
That's not
a poodle, Turtle.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.790
That's a Lhasa apso.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.501
Whatever. Check out the ass
on the broad walking it.

05:35.585 --> 05:38.796
She's not for us.
Lhasa apsos are very finicky dogs.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.257
And finicky dogs have finicky owners,
and finicky owners

05:41.341 --> 05:44.093
wait two weeks before they even
give you a tug.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.928
All right, Drama,
then you choose.

05:47.222 --> 05:49.682
I can't. There's too many
to choose from.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.517
- It's like Mardi Gras.
- Yeah.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.979
Oh my God, look at
that handsome devil.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.023
Looks like Arnold
chose for us.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.567
Oh... my... God,

05:59.651 --> 06:02.028
he is so beautiful.

06:02.320 --> 06:03.404
You too.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.200
Your puppy...
he's beautiful.

06:08.285 --> 06:09.952
I've had rotts
my whole life.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.662
- Us too.
- Really?

06:11.955 --> 06:14.040
Oh yeah.
- True dog people know

06:14.124 --> 06:17.293
that a Rott's tough exterior
is merely a protective shell

06:17.377 --> 06:19.920
that hides a wealth of sensitivity
they have within.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.592
I've never heard
that before.

06:24.676 --> 06:26.177
But I like it.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.849
I'm not suggesting
that you flirt with the guy, all right?

06:31.933 --> 06:33.059
Then what are you
suggesting?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.351
I'm suggesting that
you look at Jay Lester

06:34.436 --> 06:36.812
like you look at Brad Pitt,
'cause that's what he is...

06:36.980 --> 06:38.355
the Brad Pitt of TV writing.

06:38.482 --> 06:42.151
Brad Pitt is not my type, Ari.
I hate blue eyes.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.820
I like more of a brown-eyed
doe-eyed look.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.948
Pretend it's fucking Bambi you're eating
with then, Lloyd, but smile.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.658
There he is.

06:49.951 --> 06:52.203
- That does not look like Bambi.
- Smile, Lloyd.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.418
- Yo, how'd you get here?
- I cabbed it.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.212
- Thanks.
- See? I can cope.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.923
What did you want to talk about?
Sounded important.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.925
Nah, nothing. I just wanted to talk
about this weekend.

07:06.009 --> 07:07.802
Shit.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.261
- Amanda?
- Yup.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.597
I get it.
She's stressing you out

07:11.681 --> 07:13.599
'cause Mendes
is stressing her out.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.601
I don't wanna
be stressed.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.770
Let's go away this weekend.
We'll have some wine,

07:17.854 --> 07:20.356
think about "Glimpses"
and we'll tell her when we get back.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.109
- We need a nice vacation.
- Yeah, we do.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.736
I don't want you flipping
through your Rolodex looking for a girl.

07:25.821 --> 07:28.280
- Oh, no need. I got the perfect girl.
- Who?

07:28.406 --> 07:30.699
That girl Lindsay,
from Sloan's charity event.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.951
The one you fucked
in the coat-room?

07:32.035 --> 07:33.327
She was nice, right?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.121
I mean, you fucked her
in the coat-room.

07:35.205 --> 07:38.290
Don't be so judgmental. She's studying
labor law. She's very bright.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.667
You've never even been
on a date with her.

07:39.751 --> 07:43.504
That's what she said. Then she said,
"Wow, this would be a great first date. "

07:43.797 --> 07:45.548
- Is it cool?
- No, not really.

07:45.674 --> 07:48.259
- Sloan won't like her?
- It's not that Sloan won't like her,

07:48.343 --> 07:50.386
but Sloan doesn't wanna
go away on a first date with you.

07:50.846 --> 07:52.263
- Why not?
- 'Cause it'll annoy her.

07:52.556 --> 07:54.723
Last month, we went to Mastro's
with that girl Stacy.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.976
You guys were making out,
holding hands the whole time.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.562
- It totally freaked Sloan out.
- She was freaked out?

07:59.729 --> 08:01.313
Why didn't you tell me?
I would have apologized.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.983
Although, it was Sloan
who ordered all those shots.

08:04.067 --> 08:05.860
It's cool. You don't
have to apologize.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.570
God, I didn't realize
Sloan was so uptight.

08:07.654 --> 08:08.737
She's not uptight.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.490
But girls, they go away,
they don't wanna go with anyone.

08:11.575 --> 08:13.159
I don't have anyone else
I wanna go with.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.285
- Really?
- Really.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.078
Fuck, that sucks.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.414
Yeah, it does suck.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.126
We are in the clear.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.044
- Really?
- Yup.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.422
Heading over now to plan
our romantic getaway.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.882
Nice work.

08:46.610 --> 08:49.820
- What's wrong?
- Them.

08:53.617 --> 08:55.534
I get shy when
Maddy watches me.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.370
Arnold, beat it.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.587
Maybe, if I do this...

09:08.423 --> 09:10.299
Nice.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.888
Oh my God!

09:16.473 --> 09:18.307
Oh, shit.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.979
I don't need
another TV show, Ari.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.981
What I need
is my own network.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.318
Fuck ABC, NBC and CBS.
Why make them richer?

09:29.486 --> 09:31.695
I love it:
Jay TV.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.573
Prey on my vanity.
That's... that's priceless.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.537
- This one's shy, huh?
- Me? No.

09:40.622 --> 09:43.123
No? Would you like to try a sand dab,
Lloyd? They're delicious.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.418
- No, thank you.
- No? You don't like sand dabs?

09:46.628 --> 09:50.005
No, I do, I just have a rule I don't eat
food off other people's plates.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.634
- It's a pretty silly rule.
- It is.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.761
- Try a sand dab, Lloyd.
- Come on, Lloyd, you'll love 'em.

09:55.845 --> 09:57.429
You know what they say,
rules were meant to be broken.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.307
Oh, put that away.
Here we are. Open up.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.309
Aah...

10:06.523 --> 10:07.898
Yum!

10:09.317 --> 10:11.610
Look, Ari,
everyone knows

10:11.695 --> 10:13.612
you're a god when it comes to making
your clients rich,

10:13.697 --> 10:15.823
but guess what?
I'm already rich.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.742
So I ask you this...
can you make me happy?

10:18.910 --> 10:21.453
Eh... and if you can,

10:21.997 --> 10:23.330
can you keep me happy?

10:23.415 --> 10:26.542
- Jay, may I speak freely?
- Certainly, Lloyd. But project.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.794
Yeah, Lloyd, project.

10:29.963 --> 10:33.007
The Miller Gold Standard
is a full-service agency.

10:33.174 --> 10:35.384
I've been at three majors
over the past four years...

10:35.593 --> 10:36.885
- Wow.
... and I can assure you,

10:37.012 --> 10:40.306
none can provide the full
range of services that we can.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.808
I guarantee that all of your needs
will be handled.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.227
I guarantee
that you will be happy.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.688
Here comes the airplane.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.237
Oh, wow.
- This place looks incredible.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.781
Yeah.
Two or three nights?

10:58.241 --> 11:00.701
- How about four?
- Really?

11:00.785 --> 11:02.536
You can get away
that long?

11:02.620 --> 11:04.747
Come on,
I'm my own boss.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.500
It's Vince.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.503
- Yo, buddy.
- Yo, E, I just had a great idea.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.881
- Yeah?
- Yeah. The four of us go out tonight...

11:13.965 --> 11:15.591
that way we get the first date
out of the way.

11:16.634 --> 11:18.010
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.928
And if Sloan doesn't like Lindsay
for any reason,

11:20.096 --> 11:21.638
- no big deal, we're out.
- Yeah?

11:21.765 --> 11:25.434
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.563
What?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.733
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.528
Fucking Arnold.
I got blue balls so bad,

11:36.613 --> 11:38.572
my dick feels like
it's gonna break off.

11:38.656 --> 11:39.865
Yeah, me too.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.867
Dude, my girl has
the nicest tits in the world.

11:41.951 --> 11:43.994
Who knows if I'll ever
get to feel them again?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.289
- Fucking Arnold.
- Fucking Arnold.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.542
Here they come.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.213
Hey, how is
the little lady?

11:54.297 --> 11:56.673
She's all stitched up,
but they think she'll be fine.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.425
Oh, thank God.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.552
Shall we head back up
to the pool then?

12:00.637 --> 12:01.637
Oh, you guys can go.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.931
They want to observe Maddy
for a few more hours,

12:04.015 --> 12:06.225
and we just
don't wanna leave her.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.310
Aw... and we don't wanna
leave you girls.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.105
We feel just awful
about this.

12:11.481 --> 12:13.816
Thanks, that's sweet.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.735
Me too. I feel awful.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.654
I'm sorry.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.158
Hey, couldn't we at least try to wait
it out by the pool?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.202
Jesus, Turtle,
you reek of desperation.

12:25.286 --> 12:28.330
- How much longer can we stay here?
- However long it takes.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.999
If you wanna bust a nut today,
you might have to earn it.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.668
I always have to earn it.

12:33.545 --> 12:35.879
Ari, Ari...
- Lloyd, calm down.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.006
It sounds like you're having multiples,
for Christ's sakes.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.425
Jay Lester's on the line.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.969
Stop flapping your gums
and put him through.

12:44.347 --> 12:47.349
Jay... is this a happy call
or a sad one?

12:47.475 --> 12:49.476
I'm proud to say
it's a happy one, Ari.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.229
Congratulations,
I've decided to go with you.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.277
Excellent news,
excellent news, Jay.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.154
Yeah, I certainly
hope so, Ari.

13:00.363 --> 13:03.740
You know what? I'm gonna have Lloyd
send over the papers ASAP.

13:03.825 --> 13:06.577
Actually, I was kind of hoping that
Lloyd could deliver them himself.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.874
- ARl: Messenger's faster, Jay.
- It's a tradition, Ari.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.544
I always do a little signing ceremony
with my new agent's assistants.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.213
Shall we say, 9:00-ish?

13:20.717 --> 13:22.885
Let me get back to you
in five, Jay.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.600
Let's not jump
to conclusions, Lloyd.

13:29.684 --> 13:32.436
He just might want a pretty Mongolian
face to look at over dinner.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.022
- What if it's more, Ari?
- What if it's more what, Lloyd?

13:36.191 --> 13:38.859
All great men have had
to make great sacrifices

13:38.943 --> 13:40.736
at some point
in their lives.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.114
This means a lot
to you, huh, Ari?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.742
It means a lot to the agency.
You're a part of the agency.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.827
So it should mean
a lot to you as well.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.917
Okay.
Ari, I'll go.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.336
Thank you, Lloyd.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.921
All right!

14:01.591 --> 14:04.301
But I'm not going for me
and I'm not going for the agency,

14:04.385 --> 14:05.677
I'm going for you.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.554
Hey, whatever gets you
through the night.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.395
I can't believe you guys ordered in
from Locanda Veneta.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.356
Well, if we weren't
stuck here all night,

14:17.440 --> 14:20.317
we'd probably take you to one of
LA's finest restaurants.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.402
L'Orangerie, perhaps.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.946
Cheers.

14:24.322 --> 14:26.240
Have you thought
about what I said?

14:26.324 --> 14:27.449
A little bit.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.536
Yeah, because a behavior
modification class

14:30.620 --> 14:32.955
could really do
wonders for Arnold.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.249
- Yeah?
- Yeah, because...

14:35.333 --> 14:38.418
see, today he did
something bad.

14:38.503 --> 14:42.548
Next time, he might do
something really bad.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.093
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

14:46.177 --> 14:48.136
A word, ladies.
- Oh.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.392
How much longer do I have
to listen to this girl

14:53.476 --> 14:55.644
talk shit about my dog?

14:55.728 --> 14:59.189
- Just a little longer, Turtle.
- I don't know if I can take it.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.401
Look at those asses.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.486
You can take it.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.114
Maddy can go home.

15:07.198 --> 15:08.907
- Hey!
- Oh, thank God.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.201
Can we help you
carry her out?

15:11.286 --> 15:13.203
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.831
- It's gonna be okay.
Thank you.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.585
- Why won't you just tell him?
- 'Cause this is easier.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.336
What's easier?
Going to dinner

15:21.421 --> 15:22.754
and then saying we don't
wanna travel with you?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.548
Yeah.
He gave me an out.

15:24.632 --> 15:26.091
Said if I don't like her,
they won't go.

15:26.175 --> 15:28.051
- And if you do like her?
- Doesn't matter.

15:28.136 --> 15:30.637
- I'm saying I don't.
- All this to not upset Vince.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.347
How sad.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.349
- Do you wanna go away alone with me?
- Yes.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.310
- Then this girl's awful.
- Eric!

15:36.394 --> 15:37.894
She's awful, Sloan, stop.

15:37.979 --> 15:40.314
- Hey, there. Look who's on time.
Hey!

15:41.899 --> 15:43.984
- Lindsay, this is Eric.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.485
- Nice to meet you.
- And Sloan.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.404
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.656
- You have a beautiful dress.
- Thank you.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.033
Shall we sit?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.993
I love your dress.
Where'd you get it?

15:53.077 --> 15:55.203
- Off to a good start.
- We'll see.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.247
Oh, and I think you
should call Amanda now.

15:57.332 --> 16:00.542
- Why?
- Because she's not in.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.169
Good thinking.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.466
This is Amanda.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.054
- She's a hard worker.
- Try again after 10:00.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.329
Let me tell you something...

16:42.585 --> 16:44.086
Oh, Lloyd.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.838
Come here.
I'll see you later.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.590
Hi, Mr. Lester.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.636
Mr. Lester was my alcoholic father,
Lloyd. Call me Jay.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.847
Okay, Jay. I brought
the client agreements.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.099
We'll get to that
in a minute.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.393
Why don't you take
a load off first?

16:59.852 --> 17:02.062
Not there, here.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.785
Ari, are you okay?

17:17.994 --> 17:19.704
- Ari!
- What, baby, what?

17:19.789 --> 17:21.790
What's the matter?
You've been in a fog since dinner.

17:23.835 --> 17:25.794
I sold my soul today,
baby.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.630
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said, but for what?

17:28.756 --> 17:31.633
So we could have
two showerheads

17:31.718 --> 17:33.427
and a plasma
in every room.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.681
Tomorrow's a new day, Ari.
Remember...

17:37.765 --> 17:40.142
you always have a chance
to get it back.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.811
We're Jews, baby.
No, we don't.

17:43.646 --> 17:44.938
Ari.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.830
- I gotta make a stop.
- Where?

18:01.914 --> 18:04.040
Boys Town, baby,
buckle up.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.461
Ari, what are you doing?

18:07.545 --> 18:09.546
Fuck!

18:21.851 --> 18:23.810
Maybe we should think

18:23.895 --> 18:26.688
about neutering him.

18:27.732 --> 18:30.317
I don't know. I mean,
cutting a guy's nuts off,

18:30.401 --> 18:32.694
- you really think that's necessary?
- Yes.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.447
Turtle, I do. It will make him
less aggressive.

18:35.531 --> 18:38.700
I don't wanna see anyone else's dog
suffer the way Maddy did.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.535
Mm-hmm.
I hear ya.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.954
Look, I know that you
think that your dog

18:43.039 --> 18:45.290
is a good dog.

18:45.374 --> 18:48.460
No, honey, I know
my dog is a good dog.

18:48.544 --> 18:51.296
Well, maybe you're
just not a good owner.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.256
Ha.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.802
Maybe you shouldn't
be the one talking.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.136
I mean, after all,

18:58.221 --> 19:00.138
it is your fault
that your dog got chomped.

19:00.223 --> 19:03.058
If you wouldn't have thrown a $40 piece
of filet right in between them,

19:03.142 --> 19:06.186
maybe you wouldn't have spent
the entire day in the vet's office.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.104
You're blaming me?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.232
What the hell did you
think was gonna happen?

19:10.316 --> 19:13.068
And what about the insensitivity
of taking a piece of meat

19:13.152 --> 19:15.153
that Drama spent a day
and a half marinating

19:15.238 --> 19:17.280
and just throwing it
on the ground?

19:22.495 --> 19:23.787
Get out.

19:24.747 --> 19:28.041
- Come on, baby. Let's not fight.
- Get out!

19:36.926 --> 19:39.094
Oh, Allyson.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.764
Cheryl...

19:42.849 --> 19:45.350
- Do you hear that?
- No, I don't hear a thing.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.227
- Get out!
Stop yelling!

19:47.311 --> 19:49.688
Allyson!

19:49.772 --> 19:52.524
Oh, for the love of God,
not again!

19:58.948 --> 20:01.992
I mean, could this be
going any better or what?

20:02.076 --> 20:04.244
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

20:04.328 --> 20:05.787
I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

20:05.872 --> 20:08.707
They haven't let us say a word
all night. They're getting along great.

20:08.791 --> 20:11.001
That's 'cause Sloan's a nice girl.
She won't be rude.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.544
I can read
her body language.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.588
- What's it say?
- She's uncomfortable.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.256
I think she feels
threatened by Lindsay.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.177
Vince, how come you didn't tell me
that Sloan lived in Italy?

20:21.262 --> 20:23.805
Yeah, we just figured out
that we lived two blocks

20:23.890 --> 20:25.098
from each other
in Florence.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.767
Wow, that's a crazy
coincidence.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.060
Isn't it, E?

20:29.145 --> 20:31.187
A lot of people live in Florence.
It's not that crazy.

20:31.314 --> 20:33.565
- Right, Sloan?
- I don't know.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.317
I thought
it was interesting.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.741
- Are you okay, Sloan?
- Yeah, I'm great. Why?

20:42.825 --> 20:44.326
- No reason.
Should we get a check?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.119
We haven't even
had dessert.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.872
They have the best gelati
in the world here.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.333
Better than
at the Piazza Del Torta?

20:51.417 --> 20:52.584
On Via Roma?

20:52.668 --> 20:55.337
La Cantinetta Antinori!

20:56.088 --> 20:58.465
You girls
are like sisters.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.467
It's so beautiful.
Cheers.

21:02.553 --> 21:05.096
E, let's just cut
to the chase.

21:05.181 --> 21:07.599
Do we four wanna have
a wonderful weekend in Napa or what?

21:07.683 --> 21:09.684
- Well, I do.
- So do I.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.728
Come on, E.
It'll be fun.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.523
- Okay, then.
To Napa!

21:17.109 --> 21:19.361
This is gonna be
so much fun.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.448
- I'm so glad I passed your test.
- My test?

21:23.532 --> 21:25.075
Vince told me that you're
a little particular

21:25.159 --> 21:26.451
about what girls you travel with.

21:26.535 --> 21:29.537
And I'm the same way,
so I wasn't offended at all, really.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.374
I never said that, Vince.
Why would you think that?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.460
- 'Cause that's what E told me.
- Eric?

21:35.544 --> 21:37.462
I can't believe you told
Lindsay that, Vince.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.881
I had to give her a heads up.
I can't believe she told you.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.883
I'm sorry. I can't help
myself sometimes.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.551
I get so excited
I start rambling.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.553
I can't believe you're blaming this
on me, Eric.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.807
- Why, is it not true?
- No, it's not true. Tell him, E.

21:53.229 --> 21:54.396
Jesus, Ari!

21:54.480 --> 21:56.106
Be back in a flash,
baby!

22:18.629 --> 22:21.673
Coming through.
All right, civilian, no touching.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.258
That's all right.
Ow!

22:26.303 --> 22:27.762
Lloyd!

22:29.390 --> 22:31.182
- Ari.
- David.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.685
- I can't believe it. I'm shocked.
- That makes two of us.

22:33.769 --> 22:35.562
- What would the wife think?
- Probably the same as yours.

22:35.646 --> 22:37.647
- Mine's in the car.
- Ooh, interesting.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.691
Just here to take care
of a client, David.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.943
And I'm doing research
for a movie I'm producing.

22:42.069 --> 22:43.820
Let's just say your
secret's safe if mine is.

22:43.904 --> 22:45.363
Great.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.158
How about me, you, and that wife of
yours get together for a drink sometime?

22:48.242 --> 22:50.535
Maybe just the two of us alone,
see what's what.

22:50.619 --> 22:51.703
Let me get back
to you on that.

22:51.787 --> 22:55.290
David, my assistant's about to be
gang-raped by a gang of one.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.252
Here you go.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.879
Hope you guys
don't mind a third wheel.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.505
Hi, Ari.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.841
You drunk, Lloyd?

23:04.925 --> 23:06.676
Very very buzzed.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.054
Ari, what are
you doing here?

23:09.138 --> 23:11.056
I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd come by

23:11.140 --> 23:12.766
and see how my two
favorite people are doing.

23:12.850 --> 23:16.561
Your two favorite people
are just getting ready to leave, okay?

23:16.645 --> 23:18.813
Come on, Lloyd.
Time to hit the road.

23:19.815 --> 23:21.566
Why don't we
stay and dance?

23:21.650 --> 23:24.069
- We'll dance later, Lloyd.
- Dance here? That is a great idea.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.237
Why don't we go down there
and cut up a goddamn rug?

23:26.322 --> 23:29.991
No, Ari. This is my date.
We're gonna do what I want.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.743
I'm sorry, Jay. I can't let
you go anywhere with Lloyd.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.078
And why's that?

23:35.831 --> 23:37.874
I came down here tonight,

23:38.292 --> 23:40.710
to a part of town that I only drive
through fast,

23:40.961 --> 23:44.422
because I wanted to show you that I am
100% dedicated to being your agent.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.174
In fact, I will reserve
a center table,

23:46.467 --> 23:49.469
sit here with you,
hold your hand while you write

23:49.553 --> 23:51.721
or chase cock,
whatever it is you do.

23:52.098 --> 23:54.474
But I can't let you leave
with Lloyd. I'm sorry.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.935
Well, I'm very sorry
to hear you say that, Ari.

23:57.019 --> 24:00.105
Because I've wined him.
I've dined him.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.734
And if he's not coming
home with me tonight,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.569
these papers aren't
getting signed.

24:06.654 --> 24:08.363
That is actually
fine with me.

24:08.531 --> 24:10.156
Because you know what?

24:10.366 --> 24:13.201
We may be whores at my agency,
but we ain't pimps.

24:13.494 --> 24:15.036
Let's go, Lloyd.

24:17.164 --> 24:18.832
Ari Gold,
you're my hero.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.167
Come with me, Lloyd.
I'll buy you a car.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.629
I already have a car,
so I'm gonna have to pass.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.673
That's fine. That's fine.
And you know what?

24:26.757 --> 24:29.759
I'm better off.
You know the old saying:

24:29.844 --> 24:32.971
Fuck Chinese and you're horny
again a half hour later.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.474
I am an American
of Chinese descent,

24:36.559 --> 24:37.725
and you are what, Jay?

24:37.810 --> 24:40.937
Just another overweight
hack TV writer!

24:43.566 --> 24:45.650
Remind me never to get
on your bad side, Lloyd.

24:45.734 --> 24:49.237
- Ari Gold, you could never.
- Way to go, Ari.

24:49.321 --> 24:50.947
Way to go!

24:53.951 --> 24:55.577
Just relax.

25:04.086 --> 25:06.504
You couldn't let it die,
could you, Turtle?

25:06.964 --> 25:09.048
You just couldn't
keep your mouth shut.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.135
I can't take a girl over Arnold, Drama.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.511
He's like
a brother-in-arms.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.555
Was that brother gonna help you
with them blue balls?

25:15.639 --> 25:17.724
It's fine. You should
have just told me.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.142
I know.
You're right.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.936
But you gotta admit, you are a little
sensitive about this shit.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.939
- What shit?
- E doesn't want me to go on his trip.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.066
And he thought I'd be
insulted if he told me not to go.

25:27.193 --> 25:28.902
Why wouldn't he
want you to go?

25:28.986 --> 25:32.822
Seriously, E, we always have a good time
when we travel together, no?

25:34.116 --> 25:35.491
You mad?

25:36.327 --> 25:38.203
No, of course not.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.871
Have a good time.

25:39.955 --> 25:42.207
But you guys
got me thinking.

25:42.291 --> 25:44.292
Maybe we should do
a little trip together.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.461
Hell, yeah!
- Where to?

25:49.798 --> 25:52.091
Oh, you...

25:59.558 --> 26:01.559
Oh, Palmilla, Palmilla.

26:01.644 --> 26:04.270
Cabo San Lucas is beautiful this time of year.

26:04.355 --> 26:06.606
- Isn't it spring break?
Well, I hope not.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.108
E would be real upset
if he missed spring break.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.362
E always did appreciate a good
old-fashioned wet t-shirt contest.

26:12.446 --> 26:14.113
Nah, he's gonna
have a great time.

26:14.198 --> 26:16.074
Excuse me,
could I have another shot of Patron?

26:16.158 --> 26:18.243
Dos, por favor.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.119
All right,
get it in here.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.663
- Cabo.
- Cabo.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.207
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

26:35.344 --> 26:37.637
Only seven hours
from Napa.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.140
What, are you not gonna
talk to me the whole trip?

26:41.225 --> 26:43.893
Oh, I'll talk, but I wouldn't
expect much else.
