Come this way, come this way.

00:32.417 --> 00:34.019
Turn over.

01:04.128 --> 01:06.397
Mmm.

01:18.248 --> 01:21.385
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

01:22.287 --> 01:24.790
Was it okay for you?

01:24.825 --> 01:26.759
Yeah, of course.

01:27.696 --> 01:29.063
Are you sure?

01:29.097 --> 01:32.001
You're usually
a little more animated.

01:32.035 --> 01:34.069
It was a quiet one.

01:34.104 --> 01:35.705
Well, that's no fun.

01:35.740 --> 01:38.708
Come on, let's see if we
can make some noise, huh?

01:38.742 --> 01:42.479
Oh, honey.

01:42.514 --> 01:44.783
It's okay.

01:44.817 --> 01:47.719
Honey, not now.

01:49.923 --> 01:52.459
What is it?

01:52.493 --> 01:55.528
Nothing. I'm just...
I'm just a little spent.

01:59.302 --> 02:00.937
You're sure there's
nothing wrong?

02:00.972 --> 02:02.673
It's fine.

02:04.342 --> 02:06.979
I'm gonna grab
a glass of water.

Fuck!

05:07.348 --> 05:09.584
Hello.
Where's my fuckin' money?

05:09.618 --> 05:12.520
- I'm in a bit of a bind.
- <i>And you're calling me.</i>

05:12.554 --> 05:15.524
Am I the only one
detecting a pattern here?

05:15.558 --> 05:16.992
I'm on a take. I got boxed.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.796
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- State Museum, Harrisburg.

05:19.830 --> 05:21.816
- The State Museum. How
the mighty have fallen.

05:23.836 --> 05:26.839
I'll bet she could suck the
chrome off a trailer hitch.

05:26.873 --> 05:28.841
<i>It's a Modigliani exhibit.</i>

05:28.875 --> 05:30.327
I don't know which I find
harder to believe...

05:30.328 --> 05:31.778
that there's a Modigliani

05:31.813 --> 05:34.916
<i>in Harrisburg or that you got
boxed in a State Museum.</i>

05:34.951 --> 05:37.119
There was no box
in the schematics, Job.

05:37.153 --> 05:39.890
Well, not in the ones
you were looking at, baby.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.694
Oh, look, the alarm's
got a dialer.

05:42.728 --> 05:43.996
- State police are responding.
ETA... six minutes.

05:45.297 --> 05:47.366
I'm telling you,
you should ask her out.

05:47.401 --> 05:50.770
Job, I can barely hear you.
Can you turn this shit off?

05:52.374 --> 05:53.908
- <i>Is it off?</i>
- Yeah.

05:53.942 --> 05:55.443
Then I'm in there with you.

05:55.478 --> 05:57.112
<i>And I'm gonna get you out.</i>

05:57.146 --> 05:58.847
Okay. Is there
a manual release?

05:58.882 --> 06:01.951
<i>Not one that you can reach</i>
<i>without a blowtorch.</i>

06:01.986 --> 06:04.388
What's behind these walls?

06:04.422 --> 06:06.857
Solid stone. Someone knew
what they were doing.

06:28.418 --> 06:30.019
Hold on a second.

06:32.122 --> 06:33.823
- Hello?
<i>- Oh.</i>

06:33.858 --> 06:36.526
I figured I'd get
your voice mail.

06:36.561 --> 06:40.298
- I keep odd hours.
- <i>We need to talk.</i>

06:40.332 --> 06:42.134
Now is not really
an ideal time.

06:42.168 --> 06:44.169
Really? Well, it's the
middle of the night

06:44.203 --> 06:45.939
and I'm sneaking out
to my backyard

06:45.973 --> 06:48.141
because I haven't slept a single
night since you showed up.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.544
<i>You're putting me</i>
<i>and my family at risk.</i>

06:50.578 --> 06:51.945
Hold on.

06:51.980 --> 06:55.984
- <i>Job.</i>
- I know you did not just take a call

06:56.018 --> 06:57.953
<i>while I'm trying to save</i>
<i>your pasty, dumb ass.</i>

06:57.988 --> 06:59.455
Where are the cops, Job?

06:59.489 --> 07:00.923
Three minutes away.

07:00.958 --> 07:02.893
I am looking for an override.

07:02.927 --> 07:05.929
<i>Look harder!</i>

07:05.964 --> 07:09.434
Hey, Mama, you suck
any dick yet tonight?

07:09.468 --> 07:11.237
Yeah, like...
like maybe your own?

07:11.271 --> 07:13.038
Well, yeah, yeah.

07:13.073 --> 07:15.943
Wait, do you ever get bored
and tit-fuck yourself?

07:15.977 --> 07:18.312
<i>Ooh, she's gettin' pissy.</i>

07:18.346 --> 07:21.516
<i>- Oh, yeah.</i>
<i>- I think she's upset.</i>

07:21.550 --> 07:24.620
- I'll be right back.
<i>- What?</i>

07:24.654 --> 07:26.455
Job!

07:28.559 --> 07:30.059
Oh, we pissed him off.

07:30.094 --> 07:32.029
<i>Oh, yeah, we did piss her off.</i>

07:32.063 --> 07:33.864
I think she likes you.

07:33.899 --> 07:35.600
Hey, sweetie.

07:38.905 --> 07:41.875
Sit your bitch-asses down.

07:44.280 --> 07:48.150
Now I am going
back to my table.

07:48.184 --> 07:51.354
And the next one of you
that gets up out of this booth

07:51.388 --> 07:52.890
is gonna be pissing
sitting down

07:52.924 --> 07:55.860
for the rest of his life.

07:57.864 --> 07:59.582
- It's Zack's Diner, just
off the interstate...

07:59.583 --> 08:01.301
- Oh, sure, narc on a sister.

08:01.336 --> 08:03.337
She... I mean, he has a knife.

08:03.371 --> 08:04.772
<i>Job!</i>

08:04.806 --> 08:06.408
<i>Now we both on the clock.</i>

08:06.442 --> 08:08.476
Yeah, I'll be right back.

08:08.511 --> 08:09.945
<i>Ana.</i>

08:09.980 --> 08:11.713
- It's Carrie.
- <i>Listen,</i>

08:11.748 --> 08:13.115
we're gonna have to talk
some other time.

08:13.149 --> 08:14.885
No, I don't wanna have
another conversation with you.

08:14.919 --> 08:16.954
You need to stop this
for both of our sakes.

08:16.988 --> 08:18.356
Hold on.

08:18.391 --> 08:20.592
<i>Job, I need this door open now!</i>

08:20.626 --> 08:23.563
Job? You're talking to Job?

08:23.597 --> 08:25.231
Jesus Christ, you're on a take?

08:25.266 --> 08:26.734
Listen, I'm in a jam.

08:26.768 --> 08:29.503
You're on a take. Oh, my God.

08:29.537 --> 08:32.039
I got boxed. Fuck.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.582
<i>Okay.</i>

08:41.086 --> 08:43.221
<i>Okay.</i>

08:43.256 --> 08:45.357
<i>It's okay.</i>

08:45.391 --> 08:47.393
Just breathe.

08:50.932 --> 08:53.033
<i>Now, where are you?</i>

08:55.471 --> 08:58.573
State Museum, Harrisburg.

08:58.608 --> 09:02.077
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>Job will back-door it.</i>

09:02.145 --> 09:04.046
<i>Get back to him now.</i>

09:04.081 --> 09:06.249
Okay.

09:11.555 --> 09:14.591
Job, I hear sirens.

09:14.626 --> 09:16.794
One second.

09:16.862 --> 09:18.463
I've got an override.

09:19.765 --> 09:21.367
Nothing's happening. Come on.

09:21.401 --> 09:24.169
- Wait for it.
- <i>Come on!</i>

09:24.204 --> 09:25.772
Now would be good.

09:25.807 --> 09:27.541
Done.

09:31.547 --> 09:34.516
Dispatch, please advise
we're sweeping the east hallway.

10:02.250 --> 10:03.818
Ladies.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.658
Bitches.

10:31.687 --> 10:34.256
Miller, that you?

10:34.290 --> 10:35.758
Shots fired!

10:35.793 --> 10:37.593
<i>Suspect is on the move on foot,</i>

10:37.628 --> 10:39.930
<i>heading down North Street</i>
<i>to 83rd.</i>

10:39.965 --> 10:42.099
<i>He's wearing Miller's badge.</i>

10:54.115 --> 10:56.484
<i>Unit 3, respond.</i>

10:59.722 --> 11:02.191
<i>Right there! Right there!</i>

11:15.875 --> 11:19.045
<i>Cover the entrance.</i>

11:28.691 --> 11:30.026
Start moving through here.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.712
<i>Over there!</i>

11:50.486 --> 11:54.223
<i>We got the exits.
He's got nowhere to go.</i>

11:54.257 --> 11:57.294
<i>Over there! Go! Go!</i>

12:03.136 --> 12:07.006
<i>Move! Move! I see him.</i>

12:56.134 --> 12:58.570
I like that.

13:13.191 --> 13:14.658
<i>On three!</i>

13:14.727 --> 13:16.961
One, two...

13:21.301 --> 13:24.003
three, three, three!

13:35.986 --> 13:39.122
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:54.978 --> 13:56.545
How much does he know?

13:56.581 --> 13:58.348
Don't worry about Sugar.

13:58.382 --> 14:00.150
<i>He's one of us.</i>

14:00.218 --> 14:01.819
There is no us.

14:04.323 --> 14:06.492
That was some solid driving.

14:06.526 --> 14:08.360
You're still sharp.

14:10.564 --> 14:13.033
Hey, I didn't ask you
to come, you know?

14:13.067 --> 14:14.936
I didn't do it for you.

14:14.970 --> 14:17.438
If you go down, we both
end up on Rabbit's radar.

14:17.473 --> 14:19.575
Well, I guess we're
in it together, then.

14:24.015 --> 14:26.018
This is my life you're risking.

14:26.052 --> 14:28.204
- I had it handled.

14:28.205 --> 14:30.356
- Yeah, everything was
going right on schedule.

14:30.390 --> 14:31.857
Mm-hmm.

14:31.891 --> 14:34.626
What is it with you?

14:34.661 --> 14:38.330
You're still the same reckless
thrill junkie you were 15 years ago.

14:38.364 --> 14:40.633
<i>This whole sheriff thing</i>
<i>you're doing...</i>

14:40.667 --> 14:42.736
it's one long bungee jump
without a cord.

14:42.770 --> 14:44.071
- You're not so different.

14:44.072 --> 14:45.372
- I'm not out there risking
everything for the thrill.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.642
I wasn't the one
driving the getaway car.

14:52.682 --> 14:55.485
- Shut up.
- I'm serious.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.988
So am I. Shut the fuck up.

15:12.407 --> 15:14.709
What, sheriff wasn't
good enough?

15:14.743 --> 15:16.212
Now you want to be a statey?

15:16.246 --> 15:18.280
I had to improvise.

15:18.315 --> 15:20.950
You get the painting?

15:20.985 --> 15:23.186
Once a job goes south,

15:23.221 --> 15:25.122
always leave the take behind.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.994
So all that work for nothing.

15:29.028 --> 15:31.763
Maybe not.

16:11.314 --> 16:12.814
What?

16:15.852 --> 16:17.687
Nothing.

16:45.759 --> 16:48.796
- Sheriff.
- Miss Moody.

16:48.830 --> 16:51.766
Kat.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.770
Are we on a first-name
basis now?

16:56.440 --> 16:58.742
The Moody boys
are gunning for you.

16:58.776 --> 17:01.679
You killed their brother and
they're not gonna let that sit.

17:04.483 --> 17:07.286
Why would you warn me?

17:07.319 --> 17:08.887
That's not the right question.

17:08.922 --> 17:10.522
What is, then?

17:10.557 --> 17:13.794
The question is
why aren't you scared?

17:17.800 --> 17:20.034
You have a good morning, Kat.

17:24.207 --> 17:27.542
- What was that about?
- Just a friendly chat.

17:27.578 --> 17:29.612
With the widow
of the man you killed?

17:29.647 --> 17:31.415
Yeah.

17:31.450 --> 17:33.384
I'm funny that way.

17:33.418 --> 17:35.920
Sheriff, you sure you wanna be

17:35.955 --> 17:38.023
<i>showing up to work</i>
<i>looking like that?</i>

17:38.057 --> 17:40.259
Pick your battles, Brock.

17:40.294 --> 17:42.161
All right, fine.

17:42.196 --> 17:45.265
Tell it to the senator.
He's in your office.

18:01.554 --> 18:03.756
Senator Schumacher.

18:03.790 --> 18:06.725
There's a lacrosse stick
in my bed.

18:07.694 --> 18:09.296
Excuse me?

18:11.065 --> 18:13.468
Syracuse, Hopkins...

18:13.502 --> 18:17.305
all the schools
were all after Reed,

18:17.340 --> 18:19.841
offering him full rides.

18:20.944 --> 18:23.246
He was lightning on the field.

18:28.653 --> 18:31.390
Now he's dead, and my wife...

18:32.859 --> 18:35.896
<i>she's got his lacrosse
stick in our bed,</i>

18:35.931 --> 18:38.867
holding onto it
every night as she cries.

18:38.901 --> 18:41.571
I'm... sorry for your loss.

18:41.605 --> 18:44.007
I'm not here for your sympathy.

18:44.075 --> 18:45.776
I want justice.

18:48.413 --> 18:50.915
You made enough arrests that ATF
has practically closed the case,

18:50.950 --> 18:52.584
never mind that this
guy Hanson seems

18:52.585 --> 18:54.219
to have disappeared
into thin air.

18:54.253 --> 18:57.422
- It's federal jurisdiction.
- Fuck jurisdiction!

19:01.195 --> 19:05.099
This happened in your
town, Sheriff Hood.

19:05.133 --> 19:07.335
His blood is on your hands.

19:13.009 --> 19:15.845
You sleep with that
in your bed.

19:39.426 --> 19:41.077
- Alma, get me the number
of the high school.

19:47.886 --> 19:49.921
Who are you looking for again?

19:49.955 --> 19:53.592
Your telling us
about Hanson was helpful,

19:53.659 --> 19:55.293
but he's disappeared.

19:55.328 --> 19:58.164
So we're looking for anyone else
that might have been involved,

19:58.199 --> 20:01.235
someone who might be able
to lead us to Hanson

20:01.269 --> 20:03.804
or tell us where
that bad E came from.

20:03.838 --> 20:06.041
Hanson was getting
his stuff from somewhere.

20:06.075 --> 20:10.881
God, how can one town
have so many scumbags?

20:17.089 --> 20:19.158
Hey, him.

20:19.193 --> 20:21.829
- I know him.
- You know him how?

20:21.863 --> 20:25.565
Hanson and his guys beat
the crap out of this guy.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.002
I don't know why, but it was
the day before the rave.

20:29.070 --> 20:30.838
Arno Webber.

20:30.873 --> 20:32.907
I played Pop Warner with him.

20:32.941 --> 20:35.611
He's pretty small-time, but no
stranger to the penal system.

20:35.645 --> 20:37.112
He lives over
in Hitler's Bunker.

20:37.147 --> 20:39.750
- Hitler's Bunker?
- <i>It's just some run-down apartments</i>

20:39.784 --> 20:42.285
<i>where the Aryan Nation guys hang out.</i>

20:42.353 --> 20:44.455
What the hell is this?

20:44.523 --> 20:47.325
You have no right to bring her
in here without asking me.

20:47.359 --> 20:49.427
Chillax, Mom.
I'm not in trouble.

20:49.461 --> 20:50.995
Deva was just helping us with...

20:51.029 --> 20:54.566
If you want to see or speak to
my daughter, you ask me first.

20:59.907 --> 21:04.544
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hopewell.

21:06.013 --> 21:08.349
Come on, baby, let's go.

21:08.384 --> 21:10.384
<i>Not for nothing, Mom,</i>

21:10.419 --> 21:12.487
but we're trying
to catch a murderer.

21:12.555 --> 21:13.955
Now.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.765
Deva,

21:20.799 --> 21:22.700
thanks for your help.

21:24.002 --> 21:26.938
Sure. I hope
you catch the asshole.

21:32.713 --> 21:35.783
So, what was all that
with you and Mrs. Hopewell?

21:35.851 --> 21:37.786
She had a point, I guess.

21:37.820 --> 21:40.455
That was it, huh?

21:40.489 --> 21:43.859
- This the place?
- Yep.

21:43.894 --> 21:45.829
This is where the Master Race

21:45.863 --> 21:48.465
collect their
unemployment checks.

21:55.908 --> 21:57.309
They seem angry.

21:57.343 --> 21:59.412
They don't like to see
a black man with a badge

21:59.447 --> 22:01.147
stepping into
their white world.

22:01.182 --> 22:03.250
Oh.

22:03.285 --> 22:05.853
Hey, it's okay, guys.
He's one of us.

22:05.888 --> 22:08.457
His wife is white.

22:08.491 --> 22:10.760
- Nice.
- Just sayin'.

22:20.807 --> 22:24.277
- That's Arno's door.
<i>- Hey, cop!</i>

22:24.311 --> 22:26.412
What the fuck you doing here?

22:29.618 --> 22:32.020
Whatever the fuck I want.

22:37.327 --> 22:38.994
I'll go see Arno.

22:39.028 --> 22:42.231
You stay here
with the Hitler Youth.

23:03.558 --> 23:05.360
Hey, Arno.

23:24.785 --> 23:27.054
You stay the fuck back!

23:28.656 --> 23:30.089
Penn State, right?

23:30.124 --> 23:32.159
You're that all-star
nigger running back.

23:34.195 --> 23:37.665
Ah! Okay! Okay!
Fuck, what do you want?

23:37.700 --> 23:39.501
Why'd you run? Why'd you run?

23:39.536 --> 23:40.669
Instinct, man.

23:40.737 --> 23:42.806
Looking for a guy named Hanson.

23:42.840 --> 23:44.474
Seems to have gone
off the grid.

23:44.508 --> 23:45.809
I'm not telling you shit.

23:45.843 --> 23:49.314
Oh, God!

23:49.348 --> 23:51.851
You're a two-time loser, Arno.

23:51.885 --> 23:54.053
What are we gonna find
if we toss your apartment, huh?

23:54.087 --> 23:56.656
Possession? An attempt to distribute?

23:56.691 --> 23:58.158
Get a warrant, motherfucker.

23:58.192 --> 24:00.461
- Wrong answer.
- Oh, God!

24:01.863 --> 24:04.932
Off the grid.

24:04.967 --> 24:06.868
You wanna see Hanson?

24:06.902 --> 24:10.505
Well, there he is.

24:10.540 --> 24:12.475
That's Hanson's hand?

24:12.509 --> 24:14.410
Fuckin' "Addams Family," right?

24:17.149 --> 24:18.883
How do you know it's Hanson?

24:18.917 --> 24:21.019
From the tat, man.

24:21.053 --> 24:23.455
I inked him myself.

24:23.489 --> 24:25.558
<i>- A crab?</i>
- He was a Cancer, man.

24:25.593 --> 24:27.627
He was into all
this astrology shit.

24:27.662 --> 24:31.966
- Where'd you get it?
- That I can't tell you.

24:32.001 --> 24:35.003
Okay, then you're going down
for Hanson's murder.

24:35.038 --> 24:36.839
What the fuck, man?
I'm helping you.

24:36.906 --> 24:38.974
No. You're annoying me.

24:39.042 --> 24:41.277
Where'd you get
the goddamn hand?

24:41.311 --> 24:43.580
Okay, okay.

24:43.615 --> 24:47.319
<i>I work at the slaughterhouse on
the killing floor, all right?</i>

24:47.353 --> 24:49.521
Cleaning and shit.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.258
Well, one day last week,

24:51.293 --> 24:53.294
I sneak in a few pops
on the job,

24:53.328 --> 24:57.332
get a little loaded, and fall
asleep behind some crates.

24:57.367 --> 25:00.437
<i>I wake up around midnight,</i>
<i>hearing things.</i>

25:00.504 --> 25:03.708
I peek out and there's
the boss himself

25:03.742 --> 25:07.646
and that weird, quiet dude
with the bow ties

25:07.680 --> 25:09.982
carrying something
wrapped up in a tarp.

25:10.016 --> 25:12.819
I hid while they fed it
to the shredder.

25:12.854 --> 25:16.757
And when they left, I found
that down in the blood gutter.

25:16.791 --> 25:18.525
<i>I kept it.</i>

25:18.560 --> 25:20.395
Kind of like insurance.

25:20.430 --> 25:24.133
- You saw Proctor himself?
- Yeah, I did.

25:24.168 --> 25:26.770
- And you'll testify?
- Fuck, no!

25:26.804 --> 25:28.539
I'm kinda addicted
to breathing.

25:28.573 --> 25:30.708
- I can help you with that.
- Wait, wait.

25:30.742 --> 25:32.678
This is bullshit.
It's bullshit.

25:32.712 --> 25:34.079
Proctor would never
do it himself.

25:34.113 --> 25:36.015
- Cuff him.
- No, man! Wait, wait, wait!

25:36.050 --> 25:37.917
- Hey!
- Check it out! Check it out!

25:39.019 --> 25:43.123
Uh, modern technology
don't lie.

25:56.073 --> 25:59.475
<i>And the Oscar</i>
<i>for Best Picture goes to...</i>

25:59.510 --> 26:01.545
Arno Webber!

26:08.320 --> 26:10.055
You guys are gonna
protect me, right?

26:10.089 --> 26:12.023
You're a good citizen, Arno.

26:12.057 --> 26:14.092
Dude, seriously, man, you gotta
keep my name out of this.

26:14.127 --> 26:15.778
- He'll kill me.

26:15.779 --> 26:17.429
- What a loss that would
be to the Nazi gene pool.

26:17.464 --> 26:19.132
We'll be in touch.
Stay by the phone.

26:19.166 --> 26:20.700
You just took my fuckin' phone.

26:20.735 --> 26:24.172
<i>- Then stay here.</i>
- Ugh.

26:30.348 --> 26:32.850
Jesus Christ.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.753
And you confirmed
the hand's Hanson's?

26:34.787 --> 26:36.722
Prints match.

26:36.756 --> 26:39.292
So we don't get Proctor
for drugs or racketeering,

26:39.327 --> 26:42.329
but we get him on murder
of one of his own.

26:43.465 --> 26:45.200
Guess there's a poetry to that.

26:45.267 --> 26:46.768
So, we good to go?

26:46.802 --> 26:50.273
Well, it's not a slam dunk,
but it's actionable.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.076
Okay, then.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.579
Get your... get your
witness locked up tight.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.214
When his name goes
to the grand jury,

26:56.249 --> 26:57.716
he'll be an endangered species.

26:57.750 --> 27:00.286
You got it. Thanks.

27:00.320 --> 27:04.323
Sheriff, could I have a moment?

27:07.093 --> 27:08.661
It's good to see you, Gordon.

27:08.696 --> 27:10.897
Yeah, you, too. Thanks, Emmett.

27:19.175 --> 27:22.678
So this guy Webber...
Deva identified him?

27:22.712 --> 27:24.513
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:24.547 --> 27:27.784
But that's as far as her
involvement here goes.

27:28.887 --> 27:31.288
I don't see why it needs
to go further.

27:31.323 --> 27:33.691
My wife was pretty pissed.

27:37.564 --> 27:40.499
Well, I'm sorry about that.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.869
Poor judgment on my part.

27:42.903 --> 27:44.604
Don't get me wrong. I get it.

27:44.638 --> 27:47.708
The case was getting cold and...

27:47.742 --> 27:49.743
I appreciate what you did
for my daughter.

27:49.779 --> 27:51.246
Carrie and I both do.

27:51.281 --> 27:55.284
I just... I need to keep
Deva safe, you know?

27:55.319 --> 27:57.420
She's only 15.

28:01.125 --> 28:02.960
I understand.

28:04.629 --> 28:06.598
Okay.

28:07.767 --> 28:11.837
So, uh, go get him, huh?

28:39.205 --> 28:40.707
What are you thinking?

28:40.741 --> 28:43.243
I'm thinking we should
have brought backup.

28:43.277 --> 28:45.513
You are the backup.

29:19.823 --> 29:22.726
Sheriff, Deputy.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.394
What can I do for you?

29:26.931 --> 29:28.565
You're under arrest.

29:30.368 --> 29:31.802
What for?

29:31.836 --> 29:33.804
Murder.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.675
Who did I kill?

29:36.709 --> 29:39.378
Christopher Hanson.

29:46.588 --> 29:50.759
Yeah. I haven't seen
Hanson in quite some time.

29:50.794 --> 29:53.597
Yeah, that's one of the side
effects of killing someone.

29:56.502 --> 29:59.973
It saddens me that you continue
to hold me in such low regard.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.509
You'll get over it.

30:02.544 --> 30:05.780
Can we get on with this?
You stay right there.

30:17.229 --> 30:18.997
Can we get on with this?

30:56.177 --> 30:57.878
<i>So, Sheriff Hood,</i>

30:57.912 --> 31:01.249
how are you finding
the job so far?

31:01.283 --> 31:03.452
Never a dull moment, Kai.

31:03.486 --> 31:07.024
Yeah, you've been kind of
busy since you got here.

31:07.058 --> 31:09.026
I imagine things
were a bit quieter in...

31:09.060 --> 31:11.663
where was it, Oregon?

31:11.697 --> 31:15.600
Deputy Yawners mentioned
your right to remain silent.

31:15.635 --> 31:17.769
<i>Oh, come on, Sheriff.</i>

31:17.803 --> 31:20.774
If you're going to be arresting me
every time someone shows up dead,

31:20.808 --> 31:22.575
we might as well
get to know each other.

31:22.610 --> 31:24.746
I already know...

31:37.363 --> 31:38.964
Come on.

31:50.246 --> 31:51.780
Where's Emmett?

31:51.814 --> 31:54.217
The deputy fell out of the car.

31:54.251 --> 31:56.787
We got no business with him.

31:56.821 --> 31:59.457
If he's hurt
and you just left him...

32:02.629 --> 32:04.831
Right about now I'd be worried

32:04.865 --> 32:06.734
about my own ass if I was you.

32:06.768 --> 32:08.769
I got to admit...

32:10.140 --> 32:13.710
didn't count on Proctor
being with you.

32:14.646 --> 32:17.481
Two birds, one stone.

32:17.515 --> 32:19.484
Our lucky day.

32:19.518 --> 32:21.219
I don't think so, Marcus.

32:21.253 --> 32:23.088
You don't think so?

32:27.595 --> 32:31.799
You knocked every one
of my brother's teeth out.

32:31.833 --> 32:35.637
Looked like a fuckin' baby
when he opened his mouth.

32:35.671 --> 32:38.307
Yeah, and he cried
like a baby, too.

32:42.012 --> 32:46.016
Now I'm gonna take
your teeth out

32:46.050 --> 32:49.020
one by one

32:49.054 --> 32:53.158
real surgical.

32:53.192 --> 32:55.126
Then we'll see who's crying.

32:57.998 --> 33:00.533
What the fuck you laughing at?

33:00.568 --> 33:03.169
A dead man making threats.

33:03.203 --> 33:05.739
<i>Marcus, we need
to talk about this.</i>

33:05.773 --> 33:07.574
<i>You didn't say nothing</i>
<i>about messing with Proctor.</i>

33:07.642 --> 33:08.876
Shut up, Dex!

33:08.910 --> 33:10.344
We get the sheriff,
that's fair.

33:10.378 --> 33:11.678
An eye for an eye.

33:11.713 --> 33:16.084
But Proctor? We got families.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.522
What about our
brother's family?

33:18.556 --> 33:21.426
Huh? What about Cole's kids?

33:21.460 --> 33:23.695
You just didn't say nothing
about messing with Proctor.

33:23.729 --> 33:27.100
We got Proctor in the deal!

33:28.502 --> 33:31.039
God was just saving us a trip.

33:31.106 --> 33:32.974
Get him up.

33:33.008 --> 33:34.409
Get him up!

33:43.789 --> 33:45.924
Get him up, God damn it!

33:47.059 --> 33:49.127
- Ah!
- Ah!

34:02.945 --> 34:04.412
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

34:04.447 --> 34:06.749
You tore my fuckin' ear off!

34:13.891 --> 34:15.159
Don't!

34:18.898 --> 34:21.801
What, are you gonna
kill a cop, Dex?

34:21.835 --> 34:23.136
Huh?

34:23.170 --> 34:25.606
I mean, how do you
see this playing out?

34:25.641 --> 34:27.074
Shut up.

34:27.141 --> 34:29.744
What, you're...
you're gonna kill us both?

34:29.779 --> 34:32.547
And then just go home,

34:32.581 --> 34:35.784
kick back, fry up
some fuckin' venison?

34:35.818 --> 34:39.222
- I said shut up!
- No, you listen to me!

34:41.025 --> 34:43.860
I was taking Proctor in
when you guys showed up,

34:43.893 --> 34:45.963
<i>and that's what I'm gonna do.</i>

34:45.996 --> 34:47.864
You and your brothers,

34:47.899 --> 34:50.501
you came out
for some redneck justice.

34:50.536 --> 34:51.902
I get that.

34:51.937 --> 34:55.706
But you got only one shot
at getting out of this.

34:55.742 --> 34:58.512
<i>That's the one</i>
<i>I'm giving you right now.</i>

34:58.546 --> 35:02.117
Go home. Take your brothers.

35:02.151 --> 35:03.852
You do it now,

35:03.887 --> 35:05.655
<i>I might forget</i>
<i>this ever happened.</i>

35:05.689 --> 35:07.056
You'll let us go?

35:08.993 --> 35:11.562
How do I know you're
not bullshitting me?

35:11.596 --> 35:14.800
If I was,
you'd already be dead.

35:21.976 --> 35:23.809
I meant what I said.

35:23.844 --> 35:26.413
Get the fuck out of here.

35:49.274 --> 35:51.309
No, no, no. Sorry, boys.

35:51.344 --> 35:53.779
I'm gonna have
to keep the truck.

35:53.813 --> 35:56.449
You crashed my car.
Fair is fair.

35:56.483 --> 35:58.651
Once you hit the road,

35:58.686 --> 36:01.188
I'm sure you can catch
a ride to the hospital.

36:01.223 --> 36:05.427
You can come get the truck
from the Cadi tomorrow.

36:06.329 --> 36:08.631
Oh...

36:08.699 --> 36:10.300
Marcus...

36:12.136 --> 36:14.572
don't forget the rest of you.

36:19.712 --> 36:21.915
You're really gonna
let them go?

36:24.485 --> 36:26.387
I'm prioritizing.

36:26.421 --> 36:28.656
Help me get him down.

36:53.722 --> 36:55.858
Jesus Christmas.

36:55.892 --> 36:58.395
- What the hell happened to you guys?
<i>- Car trouble.</i>

36:58.430 --> 37:00.798
What the hell is this?
What did you do to my client?

37:00.832 --> 37:02.400
He's been assaulted? Kai, wait.

37:02.435 --> 37:04.002
Have you been assaulted?

37:04.037 --> 37:05.371
If you assaulted my client,

37:05.405 --> 37:07.140
I will have charges
brought up against you.

37:07.175 --> 37:08.442
You, too, Yawners.

37:08.476 --> 37:11.012
I'll bring the wrath of
God down on this whole...

37:13.616 --> 37:15.185
Quiet.

37:22.594 --> 37:24.463
He's all yours.

37:33.174 --> 37:35.809
Don't even ask.

38:37.087 --> 38:40.557
Wait.

38:40.592 --> 38:42.593
<i>I got you something.</i>

38:42.627 --> 38:44.129
<i>- Is it hot?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

38:44.163 --> 38:47.900
<i>I paid for this one.</i>

39:05.722 --> 39:07.356
It's our house.

39:09.260 --> 39:11.828
It's where we're going.

39:18.772 --> 39:21.008
Where is it?

39:22.110 --> 39:24.545
<i>Far from here.</i>

40:17.044 --> 40:19.045
What's the matter? What is it?

40:28.826 --> 40:32.129
Fuck me. Please, just fuck me.

41:14.615 --> 41:16.783
Big day for you.

41:18.020 --> 41:19.787
Why didn't you just shoot
the Moody boys?

41:19.822 --> 41:22.257
They gave you
the perfect excuse.

41:22.292 --> 41:25.995
Well, if I kill every dumb
redneck that crosses me,

41:26.029 --> 41:29.600
it won't be long before people
outside Banshee start looking at me.

41:29.634 --> 41:32.971
Yeah, you could lose your job.

41:35.976 --> 41:38.344
And speaking of jobs...

41:40.949 --> 41:42.783
I want in.

41:45.621 --> 41:47.290
You want in on what?

41:47.324 --> 41:49.692
Whatever comes next.

41:53.565 --> 41:55.199
No.

41:55.233 --> 41:58.504
- What do you mean no?
- I mean no.

41:58.572 --> 42:00.140
You've been good to me.

42:00.175 --> 42:01.642
You got a good thing
going here.

42:01.676 --> 42:03.277
I'm not gonna
screw that up for you.

42:03.311 --> 42:07.382
No, this is screwed up.

42:08.686 --> 42:10.620
You think I wanna spend
what's left of my life

42:10.654 --> 42:13.824
pouring beers
and breaking up brawls?

42:13.859 --> 42:16.695
I got my life savings
in this place.

42:16.730 --> 42:20.299
It's not gonna give it
back to me when I'm done.

42:20.333 --> 42:24.538
I'm 56 years old.
That's 70 for a fighter.

42:24.572 --> 42:26.507
I'm black, I got
a criminal record.

42:26.542 --> 42:29.111
You have an interesting way
of selling yourself.

42:29.145 --> 42:30.546
Fuck you.

42:32.482 --> 42:36.152
Look, I don't need much,

42:36.186 --> 42:39.422
but I need more than I got.

42:43.395 --> 42:45.729
You have a particular
skill set?

42:47.199 --> 42:50.535
You mean aside
from saving your ass?

44:41.643 --> 44:44.345
The doctors couldn't get
Marcus' ear back on his head.

44:45.714 --> 44:47.081
Well...

44:47.116 --> 44:50.852
I guess half deaf

44:50.887 --> 44:53.155
is better than all dead.

44:56.027 --> 44:58.462
Why didn't you kill them?

45:05.105 --> 45:06.873
I'm not a killer.

45:08.476 --> 45:11.846
I think my late husband
might disagree with that.

45:11.880 --> 45:14.016
I guess he would.

45:15.318 --> 45:17.153
They're gonna keep
coming, you know?

45:27.733 --> 45:29.968
Why are you here, Kat?

45:34.741 --> 45:37.510
I don't know.

45:46.955 --> 45:48.990
Oh, you...

45:49.024 --> 45:51.393
Ah!

46:56.308 --> 46:58.377
Mr. Proctor!

46:58.411 --> 47:00.345
Would you do me
the profound courtesy

47:00.380 --> 47:02.815
of shutting the fuck up?

47:02.850 --> 47:05.552
Oh, God.

47:23.409 --> 47:25.577
<i>Hello?</i>

47:25.645 --> 47:27.714
I'm in here.

47:29.517 --> 47:31.118
Got your babysitting duty, huh?

47:31.153 --> 47:32.587
Yeah.

47:32.622 --> 47:35.158
You mind if I have a quick
word with your prisoner?

47:35.192 --> 47:38.294
If it gets him to stop
singing, I'm all for it.

47:53.015 --> 47:55.149
The wunderkind mayor,

47:55.183 --> 47:58.120
<i>here to savor the moment.</i>

47:58.154 --> 48:00.924
Enjoy it, Mr. Mayor.

48:00.958 --> 48:03.193
Because a moment is
all you'll get.

48:10.369 --> 48:12.739
Is something on your mind, son?

48:12.773 --> 48:14.140
Don't call me "son."

48:15.076 --> 48:17.611
Ah. I'm sorry.

48:17.645 --> 48:20.247
Forgot about your daddy issues.

48:20.281 --> 48:23.050
Did you know I had
to put him in a home?

48:23.084 --> 48:25.287
And when I go
visit him there now

48:25.321 --> 48:28.656
in that place and I see him

48:28.690 --> 48:30.559
and I smell him...

48:30.593 --> 48:34.797
Enterprises fail, Kendall.

48:34.831 --> 48:38.334
Or it dissolves
to make way for progress.

48:38.369 --> 48:41.505
- I'm not respons...
- You broke him.

48:43.876 --> 48:45.644
And I'm gonna break you.

48:46.713 --> 48:49.916
As long as it takes.

48:49.950 --> 48:52.486
Hmm.

48:52.521 --> 48:54.856
I admire your gumption.

48:54.891 --> 48:57.592
Most men would just grab
a shotgun and come after me,

48:57.626 --> 49:00.663
but you... you ran for mayor.

49:02.065 --> 49:04.667
It's maybe a little...
I don't know... gutless,

49:04.702 --> 49:07.304
but for someone like you,

49:07.339 --> 49:09.973
a boy who will never
really be a man...

49:10.008 --> 49:12.410
You're a blight on this town.

49:13.745 --> 49:17.082
And I'm gonna... oh!

49:17.116 --> 49:19.919
I was building this town
before you were born.

49:19.953 --> 49:21.988
You have me to thank
for all of it.

49:22.022 --> 49:24.391
Your father was weak,
barely a man.

49:24.426 --> 49:25.826
And you're no different.

49:25.860 --> 49:27.327
Break me?

49:27.362 --> 49:29.297
You're a gnat on my ass.

49:29.332 --> 49:33.035
You have no idea what real
power is, you little prick.

49:36.140 --> 49:38.575
What the fuck is going on here?

49:38.610 --> 49:40.478
I think he needs
medical attention.

49:40.513 --> 49:43.782
What happened? Dan?

50:08.680 --> 50:11.950
Okay, the charge
is murder in the first.

50:11.984 --> 50:15.387
Will you be entering a plea now
or waiting on the grand jury?

50:15.455 --> 50:17.790
My client is pleading
not guilty, Your Honor.

50:17.858 --> 50:19.259
Very well.

50:19.293 --> 50:22.764
<i>I assume you'll want</i>
<i>to discuss bail now.</i>

50:22.798 --> 50:24.899
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Your Honor, this is a murder charge.

50:24.934 --> 50:26.869
We have an eyewitness
as well as physical evidence.

50:26.903 --> 50:28.037
- <i>Mr. Proctor's wealth is a
matter of public record.</i>

50:28.038 --> 50:29.171
- The DA pulls my client

50:29.206 --> 50:30.841
into this courtroom
on a regular basis.

50:30.875 --> 50:32.275
- If there was ever a flight risk...
- There's clearly

50:32.310 --> 50:34.477
<i>a larger political agenda</i>
<i>at work here.</i>

50:34.512 --> 50:36.314
We fully expect
this case to fall apart,

50:36.348 --> 50:39.317
as all the DA's cases against
my client have in the past.

50:39.352 --> 50:41.654
<i>Mr. Proctor has never</i>
<i>fled before.</i>

50:41.688 --> 50:44.324
- <i>He's not gonna start now.</i>
- It's murder, Judge.

50:44.358 --> 50:46.359
Mr. Proctor has
a business to run.

50:46.393 --> 50:48.228
He can't do that
from a jail cell.

50:49.197 --> 50:50.497
Okay,

50:50.532 --> 50:53.968
in light of the defendant's
legal history here

50:54.003 --> 50:56.205
and the fact that he's
never been convicted,

50:56.239 --> 50:59.877
<i>I'm not going to remand him</i>
<i>until after an indictment.</i>

50:59.911 --> 51:02.546
<i>Bail is set at $300,000.</i>

51:02.580 --> 51:05.416
<i>Defendant will surrender his
passport before being released.</i>

51:05.451 --> 51:08.420
<i>Thank you, Your Honor.</i>

51:12.560 --> 51:14.594
I brought a check with me.

51:14.629 --> 51:17.732
- Eyewitness?
- Already working on it.

51:44.866 --> 51:46.934
Fuck me.

51:49.605 --> 51:52.708
You don't write,
you don't call.

51:54.043 --> 51:55.979
What do you want?

51:57.081 --> 51:58.983
Hmm.

51:59.017 --> 52:01.819
What do I want?

52:01.853 --> 52:04.890
I want a steak, fries,
and a Diet Coke.

52:04.924 --> 52:08.694
<i>I want the entire Jean Paul
Gaultier fall collection.</i>

52:08.729 --> 52:14.001
Oh, and I want $750,000
for my blown-up business.

52:15.872 --> 52:18.106
I am sorry about that.

52:20.678 --> 52:22.412
What did you expect to happen?

52:22.480 --> 52:24.248
It's fuckin' Rabbit.

52:26.385 --> 52:30.357
Well, I can get you the steak.

52:31.826 --> 52:34.162
You can start with the steak,

52:34.196 --> 52:37.766
then you can take me
shopping for new digs.

52:37.801 --> 52:40.303
- Digs?
- Mm.

52:40.337 --> 52:43.339
That's right, baby, digs.

52:43.373 --> 52:44.508
You better brace yourself.

52:44.542 --> 52:47.177
Here come the motherfuckin'
neighborhood.

52:49.014 --> 52:52.716
- You know you're gonna hate it here.
- Not true.

52:52.751 --> 52:55.320
I already hate it here.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.930
<i>I know all about witness
protection and relocation.</i>

53:02.964 --> 53:05.433
I've seen it in shitloads of movies.

53:05.468 --> 53:08.103
You gotta set me up
with a whole new life

53:08.137 --> 53:10.272
in, like, Topeka

53:10.306 --> 53:13.642
where I get to be
whatever I want,

53:13.677 --> 53:17.280
like a master electrician...

53:18.684 --> 53:20.418
or a guidance counselor.

53:21.953 --> 53:23.889
Don't judge, bro.
I got shit to offer.

53:23.923 --> 53:26.125
You are shit.

53:30.097 --> 53:31.665
I'd make a great stone mason.

53:31.700 --> 53:34.068
Is it possible for you to draw
a breath without speaking?

53:34.102 --> 53:35.537
You're an uptight motherfucker.

53:35.571 --> 53:38.040
<i>What's your blood
pressure like, man?</i>

53:40.545 --> 53:43.615
Fuck.

53:45.551 --> 53:48.722
I gotta take a piss.

53:48.756 --> 53:51.726
Well, put it back
when you're done.

53:55.799 --> 53:57.666
Who's there?

54:00.137 --> 54:02.205
Hello?

54:04.542 --> 54:06.776
<i>What the fuck's going on?</i>

54:13.052 --> 54:15.219
<i>What is it?</i>

54:23.831 --> 54:25.599
They're here for you.

54:25.633 --> 54:27.734
Fuckin' hell.

54:36.881 --> 54:39.584
Wait, are you
just fuckin' with me?

54:39.618 --> 54:41.753
Ah!

54:51.668 --> 54:54.337
Wait, wait!
Get the fuck off me!

54:54.371 --> 54:55.872
Get the fuck away!

54:55.906 --> 54:59.310
<i>I didn't tell 'em anything!</i>
<i>Hey, cop, wake up!</i>

54:59.344 --> 55:00.945
<i>Help!</i>
