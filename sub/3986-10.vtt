00:13.580 --> 00:15.275
But if we...

00:34.901 --> 00:38.029
- But how can?
- Jesus Christ.

00:38.805 --> 00:40.295
So this means that...

00:43.977 --> 00:46.878
- What?
- So no one killed any homeless men.

00:46.913 --> 00:48.642
No serial killer.

00:50.116 --> 00:51.777
Some were random killings,

00:51.818 --> 00:54.582
some were natural deaths
that were likely manipulated.

00:54.621 --> 00:57.112
- But they're not linked in any way.
- But why?

00:57.157 --> 01:00.524
The detectives used the money to fund a case
against the drug traffickers responsible

01:00.560 --> 01:02.221
for the slayings in the vacants a year ago.

01:02.262 --> 01:05.025
Last week's arrests and seizures
were a direct result.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.057
So let me just understand this.

01:10.870 --> 01:13.361
So I've been going out there for weeks,

01:13.406 --> 01:16.068
slamming the Governor
for his neglect of the homeless

01:16.109 --> 01:17.770
and declaring how we will stop at nothing

01:17.811 --> 01:20.473
to find the person responsible
for preying on the homeless

01:20.513 --> 01:23.710
and all the while...
Hey, Norman, this is my ass here.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.116
That's true, boss.

01:26.152 --> 01:28.347
But it does have a certain charm to it.

01:28.788 --> 01:31.018
They manufactured an issue to get paid,

01:31.057 --> 01:34.720
we manufactured an issue
to get you elected governor.

01:34.761 --> 01:39.095
Everybody's getting what they need
behind some make-believe.

01:39.132 --> 01:42.795
The detectives involved will be suspended
and ultimately fired, at the least.

01:42.836 --> 01:47.000
Beyond that, a criminal prosecution
on fraud and perjury charges is probable.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.167
You're saying
we call a press conference and we say,

01:49.209 --> 01:51.939
"By the way, all that stuff
about homeless people getting killed

01:51.978 --> 01:54.242
"and the Governor cutting the safety net

01:54.280 --> 01:57.306
"and us doing everything
in our power to catch the guy,

01:57.350 --> 02:01.753
- "guess what, the joke's on us?"
- Not to mention that the evidence

02:01.788 --> 02:05.053
against the traffickers
arrested last week is tainted.

02:05.091 --> 02:07.184
That case could collapse as well.

02:07.227 --> 02:09.252
I don't fucking believe this.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.022
You two are on point here.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.727
Word of this gets down to Annapolis,
the Governor's gonna wreck me with it.

02:14.767 --> 02:18.203
And if it comes to that,
you guys drop on your swords, so help me.

02:18.238 --> 02:22.504
How does word not get out
once we suspend the detectives?

02:22.542 --> 02:25.739
Never mind sending it to the grand jury
for a criminal case?

02:25.778 --> 02:30.408
The cops that did this, they gotta go. You
cannot be telling me I have to live with this.

02:30.450 --> 02:32.543
Deputy, Counselor...

02:33.553 --> 02:36.078
if you two will excuse us,
we are going to discuss this first

02:36.122 --> 02:38.090
as a matter of public policy.

02:38.124 --> 02:40.149
Until we can reason
the best way to address this,

02:40.193 --> 02:43.754
do nothing and speak to no one
about any of this.

02:43.796 --> 02:46.594
If this becomes public in the wrong way,

02:46.633 --> 02:49.397
a lot of people who were legally responsible
for the situation,

02:49.435 --> 02:53.098
good people who were, nonetheless,
in a supervisory role here...

02:53.773 --> 02:55.400
are going to suffer.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.137
And that's not the outcome
that anyone wants.

02:59.412 --> 03:03.075
What Mike is saying is that we need to be
very careful about how to proceed.

03:13.493 --> 03:17.156
I wish I was still at the newspaper
so I could write on this mess.

03:18.665 --> 03:20.656
It's too fucking good.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.579
Lester. What brings you down?

05:14.614 --> 05:18.277
We don't have anything scheduled
from you today, I don't think...

05:24.123 --> 05:26.887
40,000 from the Showboat on the boardwalk.

05:26.926 --> 05:28.917
26 at the Borgata.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.422
80 over the last year at the Taj Mahal

05:32.465 --> 05:35.059
and that's just the Atlantic City casinos.

05:36.035 --> 05:37.900
I like to play. So what?

05:37.937 --> 05:41.270
You lost three times your salary
over the last two years.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.608
I ran you through Sentinel Title
and came back with seven pages of liens

05:46.646 --> 05:50.173
and a third mortgage you folded on
two months ago.

05:50.883 --> 05:52.612
Gary, you're done.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.414
What do you mean?

05:54.454 --> 05:57.946
We found sealed grand jury papers
in the houses of drug dealers

05:57.990 --> 05:59.981
and we've got people naming you on it.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.820
You have a problem, Gary.

06:06.065 --> 06:10.001
But you have friends in this courthouse,
lifelong friends.

06:10.036 --> 06:14.234
Cop to the problem, give up the names
of those that bought from you.

06:14.273 --> 06:16.264
Disbarred? Yeah, no doubt.

06:16.976 --> 06:19.376
But you play it clean from this moment on

06:20.079 --> 06:22.172
and we both know you'll probably walk.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.685
- Why did you look at me?
- I ran the finances

06:26.719 --> 06:29.187
on everyone who worked this unit
over the last couple years.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.248
You were the only bogie.
If the S.A.O. Weren't so screwed up,

06:32.291 --> 06:35.021
they'd have been running
background checks as a routine.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.653
But I guess you knew that.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.158
I always wondered
if they'd get their shit together.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.134
But that's Baltimore, isn't it?

06:46.706 --> 06:49.004
So what happens now?

06:49.041 --> 06:50.736
Well, for starters...

06:55.348 --> 06:57.339
you're gonna make a phone call.

06:59.318 --> 07:03.015
McNulty, Freamon, Sydnor...

07:03.055 --> 07:05.785
Any one who has the smell
of this on them should be gone.

07:05.825 --> 07:07.952
Before the close of business,
they should be suspended

07:07.994 --> 07:09.393
and, before the end
of the week, indicted.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.556
- I know, but...
- But what?

07:11.597 --> 07:14.794
We're gonna let this shit stand
because it'll hurt Carcetti to air it out?

07:14.834 --> 07:18.429
Instead of cleaning house like we need to,
he's up there figuring out how to hide the dirt.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.463
I got a mind to call the Governor myself
and just let it fly.

07:21.507 --> 07:23.941
- Cedric, you can't.
- Why not?

07:23.976 --> 07:27.036
If I let this thing stand, I might as well
just roll over and play dead

07:27.079 --> 07:29.070
for every police who knows about this.

07:31.617 --> 07:35.485
- We cover this up...
- Cedric, you can't do anything.

07:35.521 --> 07:36.920
Those are your detectives.

07:36.956 --> 07:39.390
They need someone to blame,
they will measure you for it.

07:39.425 --> 07:41.290
I don't give a fuck.

07:44.163 --> 07:46.097
And they'll fire me.

07:50.903 --> 07:52.871
You heard Steintorf.

07:55.274 --> 07:56.969
I was in charge of this thing.

07:57.009 --> 07:59.204
I was on that wiretap.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.113
This is my career.
This is everything.

08:09.121 --> 08:13.114
You go public and it hurts Carcetti.

08:14.060 --> 08:18.463
Maybe he doesn't get to be governor
but he is still the Mayor,

08:18.498 --> 08:20.557
and Bond is still my boss,

08:20.600 --> 08:23.068
and you know the weight will not fall on them.

08:23.102 --> 08:25.161
- It never does.
- Christ.

08:27.206 --> 08:31.040
Everything I worked for, all those years
in that courthouse...

08:37.984 --> 08:39.679
Please.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.150
25 cents. Baltimore Sun.

08:45.658 --> 08:47.489
Sir, Baltimore Sun. One quarter.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.253
- Keep it.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.529
People tip pretty good, don't they?

09:01.140 --> 09:03.040
"...paying him for what he had done to us.

09:03.075 --> 09:04.702
"I'm sorry for him, man, really,

09:04.744 --> 09:07.736
"but I still can't let him come up
from the basement."

09:11.117 --> 09:14.917
- You gonna put all that in the paper?
- That's the plan.

09:15.521 --> 09:17.955
Even the parts about Sherrod?

09:17.990 --> 09:19.582
Yeah.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.762
- What good is a story like that?
- Like what?

09:26.799 --> 09:28.767
Like me, Sherrod.
Gettin' high. Not gettin' high.

09:28.801 --> 09:30.462
My sister, all that shit in there.

09:30.503 --> 09:32.835
What good do any of that
do to put it in the newspaper?

09:32.872 --> 09:36.364
People read it, they think about it.
Maybe see things different.

09:36.409 --> 09:37.876
I don't know, man.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.743
Bubs, you don't want me
to do this, I won't do it.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.840
I don't know.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.846
Baltimore Sun. A little bit of sun. Sun paper.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.380
Look, Rupert, go public
with this thing if you want

09:52.425 --> 09:55.485
but your shop is gonna come out looking worse
for letting it happen in the first place.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.519
The better move is to shut it down quietly

09:57.563 --> 10:00.828
and then deal with those responsible
through back channels.

10:00.866 --> 10:03.858
We'll bury these guys softly
and in a hole so deep

10:03.903 --> 10:06.337
no one will ever get close
to digging them up.

10:10.042 --> 10:12.033
I can see that.

10:12.078 --> 10:14.546
Commissioner, do you agree?

10:15.681 --> 10:18.149
Well, it is a little more problematic for me.

10:19.085 --> 10:21.576
The offenders are in my shop,
are they not?

10:24.123 --> 10:26.591
Can I have a word with you in private, Bill?

10:28.260 --> 10:31.525
Hey, if Rawls isn't in, I'm not either.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.032
I wouldn't worry about Bill Rawls.

10:34.066 --> 10:38.628
I believe he's about to have
one of those road to Damascus moments.

10:40.539 --> 10:42.530
I can see what you're thinking in there.

10:42.575 --> 10:45.806
I can see the gears grinding
in that head of yours.

10:48.981 --> 10:52.542
You're thinking, "Hey,
I might have some wood on Carcetti here.

10:52.585 --> 10:54.951
"There's no way they can
pin the blame on me for this fiasco

10:54.987 --> 10:58.616
"without doing their boy Daniels, too."
You're thinking we'd have to fire Daniels

10:58.658 --> 11:02.788
to fire you and that wouldn't sit well,
given how much we've already sold Daniels.

11:02.828 --> 11:04.693
Isn't that what you're thinking?

11:04.730 --> 11:07.665
You're telling yourself maybe
there's a way for you to leverage this,

11:07.700 --> 11:09.964
to get yourself a full term as commissioner,

11:10.002 --> 11:13.529
to delay Daniels a few more years
in exchange for you shutting the fuck up

11:13.572 --> 11:15.301
and doing what you're told.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.605
And you know what, Bill?
You're not far off.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.669
You do have a little leverage here
but just a little.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.476
I wouldn't overplay your hand.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.074
How would you play it?

11:25.117 --> 11:26.982
I'd shut the fuck up and wait your turn

11:27.019 --> 11:29.886
and, when Tommy gets to the statehouse,
he brings you with him

11:29.922 --> 11:31.913
to be State Police Superintendent.

11:31.957 --> 11:35.222
Because while you may be a shade too white

11:35.261 --> 11:37.252
to run the Baltimore department,

11:37.296 --> 11:39.491
you're just about right for the M.S.P.

11:44.503 --> 11:47.131
- I have your word?
- And I have yours.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.514
Back channel is the way to go.

11:59.552 --> 12:03.682
See? The Police Commissioner
done fell off his ass.

12:10.062 --> 12:11.791
Can I help you?

12:13.365 --> 12:15.026
I need to see Mr. Prezbo.

12:16.168 --> 12:18.068
Someone will come down.

12:39.058 --> 12:42.357
- Are you a student here?
- Ms. Donnelly, it's me, Duquan.

12:43.529 --> 12:46.157
It's good to see you but
you're not a student here

12:46.198 --> 12:48.462
so I can't let you inside.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.026
I just came past to see Mr. Prezbo.

12:51.070 --> 12:52.731
Well, he's teaching right now.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.831
I know. I can wait.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.873
You're gonna have to stay outside.

12:57.910 --> 13:01.368
After the bell, I'll tell Mr. Pryzbylewski
you're out here for him, OK?

13:11.991 --> 13:14.459
I'm going to surprise you with something.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.017
You already have.

13:16.395 --> 13:21.059
I got a tip from an informant
about a leak out of the grand jury unit.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.091
Sad to say it's checked out.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.263
- We know about the leak.
- But do you know who it is?

13:26.305 --> 13:28.034
Gary diPasquale.

13:28.674 --> 13:31.643
Decent enough guy but he's got
a bear of a gambling problem

13:31.677 --> 13:34.942
and a bank of drug lawyers
who are willing to pay for their look-sees.

13:34.980 --> 13:37.642
Troy Sanders, Marvin Bronfman,

13:37.683 --> 13:40.709
Dennis Cray, Sid Silverstein.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.551
And the pick of the litter? Maurice Levy.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.187
I kid you not.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.887
Gary is their leak?

13:48.928 --> 13:52.864
He broke right away.
He was ready to give it up. Needed to.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.234
One-party consent call
implicating Maury Levy.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.764
- Where's Gary now?
- He went up to the second floor

14:00.806 --> 14:04.037
to hand in his letter of resignation
and went home to wait for the sword to drop.

14:04.076 --> 14:07.204
He's OK, he's better than you'd think.

14:08.881 --> 14:13.181
You know, if we can turn Levy
and some of these other drug lawyers,

14:13.219 --> 14:15.881
we can route the drug money all over town.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.188
It's sad business, I know,

14:19.225 --> 14:21.557
but at least we know the truth now, right?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.491
The truth, you say?

14:33.672 --> 14:35.333
Duquan, hello.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.807
Snatch-pops.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.276
Damien. You lost your mind?

14:39.311 --> 14:40.938
- But I said snatch-pops.
- I don't care.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.538
You're gonna buy him a new sandwich,

14:42.581 --> 14:45.414
and past that, you're gonna ask
Mr. Williams for a broom

14:45.451 --> 14:46.884
to clean that up, you understand?

14:46.919 --> 14:51.015
Right now or you're mine
for another week of detention.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.853
I don't want to hear another word.

14:55.828 --> 14:57.796
It looks like you got the hang of it.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.931
What's up with you?

15:00.966 --> 15:03.127
Ain't nothing.

15:03.168 --> 15:04.999
You still at Southwestern?

15:05.037 --> 15:08.495
Well, I'm, like, needing a semester off,
you know?

15:09.708 --> 15:11.505
I'm outdoors now.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.909
And...

15:14.947 --> 15:18.314
I was hoping maybe I could get with you

15:18.350 --> 15:21.877
and borrow some money,
so I can get a place and some clean clothes

15:21.921 --> 15:24.788
and get myself settled
so I can go back to school.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.422
You're on the street?

15:27.459 --> 15:30.019
I got people ready
to give me a really good place

15:30.062 --> 15:32.155
if I can come up
with some money for it.

15:36.168 --> 15:37.999
How much do you need?

15:38.037 --> 15:39.766
Couple of hundred.

15:39.805 --> 15:41.534
But if you could go one fifty more,

15:41.573 --> 15:45.703
I can enrol in the G.E.D. Program
down B.C.C.C.,

15:45.744 --> 15:48.542
then I could get my G.E.D.
Without having to go back to Southwestern.

15:48.580 --> 15:50.571
Then I can get my work permit.

15:52.084 --> 15:55.076
I don't think you're eligible
for a G.E.D. Program

15:55.120 --> 15:57.748
if you're still of age to attend high school.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.185
Yeah, you are.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.023
I'll tell you what.

16:04.063 --> 16:06.861
Give me a couple minutes,
I'll drive you down there.

16:06.899 --> 16:10.164
If you are eligible, I'll write a check
right to the bursar's office.

16:10.202 --> 16:12.136
No, Mr. P., you ain't got to go through all that.

16:12.171 --> 16:15.140
Besides, I ain't got the time
to go down there today.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.074
But, you know, I'm gonna.

16:20.045 --> 16:22.377
I can do it, if that's what you want.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.881
And I don't even care about the money.

16:26.919 --> 16:30.582
But understand I'm gonna go down
to B.C.C.C. In a few days

16:30.622 --> 16:32.613
and find out if you're enrolled.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.422
And if you are, I'm gonna say, "Great.

16:35.461 --> 16:38.624
"Duquan can come past
with his certificate when he gets it,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.894
"and we're still friends.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.924
"And he can still rely on me."

16:43.469 --> 16:45.562
But if you aren't enrolled, then...

16:47.339 --> 16:50.968
Well, I imagine I'm not gonna see you again,
am I?

16:51.010 --> 16:53.137
No, Mr. P.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.646
I'm definitely gonna enroll.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.342
You'll see.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.847
I'll get my stuff.
I'll meet you in the lot

17:03.889 --> 17:06.084
and we'll go find a bank machine.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.022
Jay, all I'm saying is we've run down
all the leads we had,

17:14.066 --> 17:16.159
all the office reports are in and, at this point,

17:16.201 --> 17:19.465
barring any new developments,
I don't need all this fucking manpower.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.837
Fuck me, Jimmy.
Last week you were crying

17:21.874 --> 17:24.104
for every swinging dick
you could get your hands on.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.509
The case has gone quiet.
There's no red ribbons,

17:26.545 --> 17:28.035
no bodies, no disappearances.

17:28.079 --> 17:30.708
Not a fucking word on the cellphone.
This thing's useless.

17:30.749 --> 17:32.546
You don't want the wiretap either, now?

17:32.584 --> 17:36.179
The judge gave us 60 days.
Once that runs out, then...

17:36.221 --> 17:38.553
Motherfucker, you were the one
who was all semper fi

17:38.590 --> 17:41.058
for this serial killer
and now you're fuckin' the dog.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.186
I'm ready to work the case.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.493
But short of any new leads,
what the fuck do you want me to do?

17:46.532 --> 17:48.363
I can't make shit up, can I?

17:51.136 --> 17:52.899
It is what it is.

17:52.938 --> 17:54.872
If I send the surveillance teams back,

17:54.907 --> 17:58.070
don't come crying for more
manpower tomorrow, you hear?

17:59.178 --> 18:01.009
Shit is like a war, ain't it?

18:01.046 --> 18:03.378
Easy to get in, hell to get out.

18:23.035 --> 18:27.062
Pearlman knows everything. Daniels, too.
They figured it out.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.404
- How?
- I don't know.

18:30.909 --> 18:33.377
- Jesus. What are they?
- I don't know.

18:34.146 --> 18:37.513
She made it clear there are not to be
any further homeless killings.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.540
Nothing more on this case whatsoever.

18:39.585 --> 18:44.147
- Does she know about Marlo, that our case?
- She knows everything. Daniels knows.

18:45.524 --> 18:47.958
They went to the E.C.U.,
dialed up the wiretap number

18:47.993 --> 18:50.655
and up pops Marlo's cellphone.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.221
Why aren't we fired?
Why aren't we in fucking bracelets?

18:53.265 --> 18:54.892
I don't know.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.498
Oh shit, Lester.

18:58.804 --> 19:02.262
We gotta get outta here.
We gotta think this thing through.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.797
Jesus fucking Christ.

19:03.842 --> 19:07.141
Look, meet me down at Kavanagh's
in ten minutes, all right?

19:41.880 --> 19:43.575
How much?

19:49.555 --> 19:50.817
200.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.984
Damn, boy. Teacher must love your black ass.

19:54.026 --> 19:58.395
C'mon with it. They gonna put out testers
up on Poplar Grove.

19:58.430 --> 20:00.125
We gonna be late for it.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.707
C'mon, boy. C'mon.

20:31.330 --> 20:32.854
Deputy.

20:55.554 --> 20:57.385
To be continued.

21:01.927 --> 21:04.987
- Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck.
- What's the matter?

21:05.030 --> 21:07.658
Cottage cheese for lunch
again there, Carl?

21:09.468 --> 21:12.733
Just because it happened
doesn't mean it's news.

21:13.805 --> 21:16.968
There's always a salmonella outbreak
somewhere.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.034
I don't see why we have to cover this one...

21:19.077 --> 21:21.375
What's the first rule of rewrite, Spry?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.381
Shoot it down.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.440
Did you read this?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.420
We are crediting our own coverage

21:29.454 --> 21:32.184
with changing the Governor's mind?

21:32.224 --> 21:33.691
I'm already to the jump

21:33.725 --> 21:35.750
and there's not a quote from anyone

21:35.794 --> 21:37.853
crediting us with anything of the sort.

21:37.896 --> 21:39.830
The guv is restoring funding, all right.

21:39.865 --> 21:43.266
That's 'cause Carcetti's been beating the shit
out of him on this issue.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.963
We're just an afterthought.

21:45.003 --> 21:47.267
Whiting can smell the public service Pulitzer?

21:47.306 --> 21:49.706
- Seems so.
- You get a chance yet?

21:49.741 --> 21:52.005
Yeah, yeah. I read it.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.602
And?

21:55.347 --> 21:57.247
Beautiful.

21:57.282 --> 21:58.772
No, no, no. I mean it.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.547
You got some real Joe Mitchell
stuff on the page there.

22:01.586 --> 22:04.487
Really makes me feel like
I know this guy and his world.

22:04.523 --> 22:06.889
You just pulled it all through the keyhole.

22:06.925 --> 22:08.051
Thanks, Gus.

22:08.093 --> 22:10.994
We get some good art,
I'm gonna push for the Sunday front.

22:11.029 --> 22:13.327
Well, I gotta make sure
the guy is good with it.

22:13.365 --> 22:14.525
What do you mean?

22:14.566 --> 22:16.090
The part of the story
about the kid bothers him.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.125
When he told me about it,
he was just talking...

22:18.170 --> 22:19.933
You told him you were
writing about him?

22:19.971 --> 22:22.531
I know, but...
I'm putting the guy's life out there.

22:22.574 --> 22:25.702
I wanna feel clean about it.
You know what I'm sayin'?

22:25.744 --> 22:27.439
I remember clean.

22:29.548 --> 22:33.450
Obviously, they're not in a hurry to go public
'cause we ain't cuffed.

22:33.485 --> 22:36.921
They're pretending on this case
like we're pretending. Why?

22:38.824 --> 22:41.816
Carcetti. He's exposed on this.

22:41.860 --> 22:45.159
How? Just blame it all on us,
on the department.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.563
To kill us, they'd have to kill Rawls, Daniels

22:47.599 --> 22:49.829
and half the chain of command.
And he made those guys.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.699
It's his police department.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.571
So he opens himself up
right when he's out there, running for governor.

22:56.208 --> 23:00.008
So they want us to do what?
Run it down quietly? That's no problem.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.070
Six months from now, after the election,

23:02.114 --> 23:04.639
they might decide to open up
and grand jury us.

23:04.683 --> 23:07.174
We could still go to jail and, if not,

23:07.219 --> 23:10.814
I expect to be back in the pawn shop unit
and you are gonna ride the boat.

23:10.856 --> 23:12.949
So what? It was worth it.

23:14.426 --> 23:16.087
Wasn't it?

23:16.628 --> 23:18.289
Depends.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.231
Are they gonna let the case against Marlo
and his people stand,

23:21.266 --> 23:22.995
knowing what they know?

23:23.034 --> 23:25.730
Why wouldn't they? It still works
on the seizures and cellphones.

23:25.771 --> 23:28.968
- It works without the illegal tap.
- Yeah, it does.

23:29.007 --> 23:31.407
And they made a big deal
about dropping Marlo.

23:31.443 --> 23:34.173
They called that press conference
and linked him to all the bodies.

23:34.212 --> 23:36.407
For them to drop the case now...

23:36.848 --> 23:38.611
You know, you think about it,

23:39.651 --> 23:42.643
we've got almost as much
on them as they do on us.

23:44.489 --> 23:45.649
That Tom Wolfe wannabe

23:45.690 --> 23:48.454
thinks he's gonna
get a phrase like that past me?

23:48.493 --> 23:50.518
No fuckin' way, motherfucker.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.727
It's like a sweater with
the threads hanging off.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.796
Pull any thread...

24:01.840 --> 24:04.570
Mostly exaggerations and too-perfect quotes,

24:04.609 --> 24:06.099
sometimes on the record.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.635
I called some of them back,

24:08.680 --> 24:11.240
asked if they really said those things.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.342
You know what the city
housing commissioner told me

24:13.385 --> 24:15.478
about the quotes in the flipping story?

24:15.520 --> 24:19.513
He wished he'd said some of them
but that he'd never been that smart in his life.

24:20.158 --> 24:23.059
Someone takes the time to...

24:23.094 --> 24:25.119
re-report this stuff, it'll get ugly.

24:25.931 --> 24:27.990
What're you gonna do?

24:28.033 --> 24:30.558
I don't know, Robert. I don't know.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.265
Keep my name out of it.

24:43.682 --> 24:45.274
No bail.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.253
They're claiming a propensity for violence
and witness intimidation at the bail review,

24:49.287 --> 24:50.982
trying to have you held as the kingpin.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.149
- They can do that?
- They can try.

24:53.191 --> 24:55.250
Depends on which judge they draw.

24:56.728 --> 24:59.891
So they ain't got no bail for Chris, right?
I mean, he got the murder one.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.296
Monk neither.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.234
Too much weight in his car
and he's on parole from the '04 charge.

25:04.269 --> 25:07.136
Best I could do was spring
Mr. Wagstaff on 300,000.

25:07.172 --> 25:09.106
- He show that kind of money?
- Put up his uncle's house

25:09.140 --> 25:13.008
on surety bond for a third of it.
Bondsman is fronting the rest on a fake lien.

25:15.113 --> 25:20.016
Right now, the important thing is not bail,
the important thing is this...

25:20.051 --> 25:22.849
I need you to tell me
who else knew your clock code.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.480
I told you.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.152
Me, Cheese, Monk, Chris

25:28.193 --> 25:30.923
- and the supply. That's it.
- No one else?

25:30.962 --> 25:33.522
No one else even had my cell number,
except you.

25:38.103 --> 25:40.128
What?

25:40.171 --> 25:42.571
- There's a lie in here somewhere.
- I ain't lying.

25:42.607 --> 25:44.575
I don't mean you.

25:44.609 --> 25:47.100
Look, the police say the source told them

25:47.145 --> 25:48.840
that you were re-upping on the day

25:48.880 --> 25:51.371
and word of that might have
slipped out. That's possible.

25:51.416 --> 25:53.577
If you were wholesaling all over town...

25:53.618 --> 25:57.850
They only grab your cells when they arrest you
and then they have to go get warrants

25:57.889 --> 26:00.221
before they can look at
the photos on the phones.

26:00.258 --> 26:02.317
And it's only when they get to the photos

26:02.360 --> 26:04.760
and break the code that they have enough

26:04.796 --> 26:07.424
to type a charging document
for you or Chris, right?

26:07.465 --> 26:09.490
I mean, you aren't caught with drugs.

26:10.869 --> 26:15.169
But they had the arrest warrants on both of you
within a couple hours.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.937
Which means that they broke
the code almost instantly,

26:18.977 --> 26:20.376
no time at all.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.541
They wiretapped me.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.175
My investigator thinks so.

26:25.216 --> 26:28.947
But he doesn't know for sure
which unit ran the tap or who manned it.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.949
It doesn't add up.

26:39.664 --> 26:41.689
You gettin' out.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.598
You ain't.

26:44.836 --> 26:47.862
You hit the streets, you round up
as much muscle as possible

26:47.906 --> 26:49.897
and get that boy.

26:49.941 --> 26:51.875
He did Snoop 'cause he knew we was on him.

26:51.910 --> 26:55.243
He knew we was on him 'cause
he the one talked about the re-up.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.980
Get your shit together, man.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.883
The bondsman came in with Levy.

27:02.587 --> 27:04.521
A'ight. I'm on it.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.092
Man, you got a dollar?

27:19.270 --> 27:20.931
C'mon.

27:45.196 --> 27:47.061
Pal.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.030
Pal, you all right?

27:54.839 --> 27:56.739
OK, here it comes,

27:57.242 --> 28:00.075
the dreaded crab claw.

28:01.379 --> 28:04.348
You know what happens
when crab claw goes...

28:05.517 --> 28:07.883
- It's all crab tonight...
- No crab claw!

28:07.919 --> 28:09.944
Yes, crab claw!

28:09.988 --> 28:12.821
Yeah! Crab claw does it again. Six!

28:13.591 --> 28:15.491
Six and I'm out...

28:18.430 --> 28:20.227
Yeah.

28:21.166 --> 28:22.758
Where?

28:23.802 --> 28:25.394
You're fucking kidding me.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.496
It's more bull...

28:27.539 --> 28:29.507
It's bogus, Jay. I'm telling you...

28:34.412 --> 28:36.175
OK.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.110
I gotta go.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.153
I have to keep running the string out.
I've no choice.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.213
You said the bosses know.

28:46.124 --> 28:50.220
Some do, some don't. The ones that do
want us to keep pretending.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.161
We stop pretending, then...

28:54.566 --> 28:57.399
Listen, we'll finish this tomorrow night, OK?

28:59.070 --> 29:00.799
I'll see you in a bit.

29:10.715 --> 29:12.444
What do you think?

29:14.619 --> 29:17.213
I mean, puttin' my shit in the streets?

29:20.191 --> 29:21.988
Well, it's you.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.359
He's got you.

29:24.395 --> 29:26.124
Yeah, well.

29:26.164 --> 29:28.132
I mean he's got what you're about.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.900
The guy likes you,
that shows through.

29:31.936 --> 29:35.667
I mean, you know, he's saying
this giving back that you're doing,

29:35.707 --> 29:38.403
he's putting that up against Sherrod.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.707
He ain't lettin' you
off the hook for shit

29:40.745 --> 29:43.714
but he's just puttin' it all out there.

29:43.748 --> 29:45.739
You know, the good and the bad.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.684
You know what?

29:49.354 --> 29:51.754
The bad don't bother me to have out there.

29:51.790 --> 29:55.351
Shit, I know the bad.
I ain't lyin' to no one about the bad.

29:56.394 --> 29:58.919
Scared of somebody callin' you good?

30:01.266 --> 30:04.758
A lot of folks volunteer places.
A lot of folks share at meetings.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.000
Plenty of motherfuckers wake up every day
and not get high.

30:08.039 --> 30:11.668
Man makin' me sound special
for doin' what the fuck I need to be doin'.

30:15.246 --> 30:16.975
Read it.

30:25.790 --> 30:28.258
"You can hold back
from the suffering of the world,

30:28.293 --> 30:30.284
"you have free permission to do so

30:30.328 --> 30:32.762
"and it is in accordance with your nature.

30:33.965 --> 30:35.830
"But perhaps this very holding back

30:35.867 --> 30:38.461
"is the one suffering you could have avoided."

30:39.470 --> 30:41.233
Fran-zee Kafka.

30:41.873 --> 30:43.465
Who's he?

30:43.508 --> 30:45.601
Some writer.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.577
You read his books?

30:47.612 --> 30:50.172
Fuck no. But you remember Flubber?

30:51.282 --> 30:54.547
He handed that to me
the night that he had me start leading

30:54.586 --> 30:56.577
the Saint Martin meeting.

30:57.622 --> 30:59.749
I kept it ever since.

31:01.025 --> 31:02.925
What it mean to you?

31:06.731 --> 31:08.528
You want these?

31:08.566 --> 31:12.297
Yeah, my man say he need it back
and not to make any copies.

31:13.504 --> 31:17.270
He say he ain't supposed to show it to me
before it goes in the paper.

31:17.308 --> 31:19.037
I mean, if I let him.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.669
You gonna?

31:24.349 --> 31:26.340
Thanks for the crabs.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.323
Gray van.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.394
- You get the tag?
- I couldn't see it from where I was.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.760
Describe the driver.

31:39.797 --> 31:41.560
White. Six foot.

31:41.599 --> 31:43.863
Not heavy, not skinny either.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.866
Clothes?

31:45.904 --> 31:47.872
Nothing I noticed. Kinda nondescript.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.101
Nondescript?

31:50.141 --> 31:53.668
I was surprised, I guess. I just thought,
"Whoa, what's he doing?"

31:53.711 --> 31:56.043
- Funny it being you to see this.
- It's weird.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.846
If an interview doesn't run late,
I'm not even here tonight.

31:59.884 --> 32:02.352
You mind if I get inside?
I gotta check in with my desk.

32:02.387 --> 32:04.514
You need anything else,
you got my number.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.284
Yeah.

32:11.162 --> 32:13.062
That guy's an asshole.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.292
This smokehound can't remember a thing.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.198
Only motherfucker
he remembers messing with him

32:17.235 --> 32:18.668
is the fella that found him.

32:18.703 --> 32:22.002
Whatever happened before that
is anyone's guess.

32:24.876 --> 32:28.334
Someone try to kidnap you,
drag you into a van?

32:28.379 --> 32:31.280
- OK.
- Who was trying to hurt you?

32:31.316 --> 32:34.046
My father. But he was a drunk.

32:34.085 --> 32:37.782
Detective, there's a vagrant over here
says he saw something.

32:40.792 --> 32:42.453
What did you see, fella?

32:48.399 --> 32:49.991
McNulty?

32:51.502 --> 32:54.232
- Johnny Weaver. Tactical.
- Fuck you. Why didn't you say so?

32:54.272 --> 32:56.263
J.W. Tryin' to keep your cover?

32:56.307 --> 32:59.765
It's better if everyone here
thinks I'm one of the regulars.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.574
Anyway, what's the ruckus with Petey?

33:01.612 --> 33:03.341
- The drunk?
- Yeah.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.046
Sun reporter says he's going into his building,

33:07.085 --> 33:09.747
he sees a guy trying to drag him
into a gray van.

33:09.787 --> 33:13.154
- It's bullshit, right?
- Yeah. Petey was laying there 45 minutes

33:13.191 --> 33:16.160
before that preppy cocksucker
even parks his car.

33:16.194 --> 33:17.718
- Thanks.
- No problem.

33:17.762 --> 33:19.525
Gimme a dollar, make it look right.

33:22.934 --> 33:24.799
Thank you, Jimmy.

33:26.337 --> 33:30.205
What about the reporter? You could charge
false statement, you know.

33:32.076 --> 33:35.773
You lock up every liar, there's no room
in B.D.C. For anyone else, right?

33:35.813 --> 33:37.747
More trouble than it's worth.

33:38.282 --> 33:40.182
Jay, it's horseshit. I'm going home.

33:40.218 --> 33:42.049
Yeah.

34:22.693 --> 34:24.888
Brought home some crabs.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.920
I already made dinner.

34:26.964 --> 34:29.694
Put 'em in the fridge.
Cold for lunch tomorrow, if you like.

34:29.734 --> 34:31.531
I can't eat 'em all.

34:43.447 --> 34:45.938
We don't run this shit,
especially not off the front.

34:45.983 --> 34:50.317
- I saw what I saw.
- Alma is on the phone with police P. I.O.

34:50.353 --> 34:52.344
And they are telling us on the record and off

34:52.389 --> 34:55.359
that they are discounting any report
of a possible abduction.

34:55.393 --> 34:58.226
That doesn't mean they're doing their job,
and it doesn't mean we...

34:58.262 --> 35:01.390
Our job is to report the news,
not to manufacture it.

35:01.432 --> 35:02.899
Fuck you, Gus.

35:04.802 --> 35:06.997
Nice.

35:13.277 --> 35:16.371
I know they're jealous of how much play
his stories get but the truth is...

35:16.414 --> 35:19.178
We cannot run this shit.

35:20.084 --> 35:23.053
Are you suggesting
that Scott made any of this up?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.418
You ever notice that the guys who do that,

35:28.926 --> 35:30.894
the Blairs, the Glasses, the Kelleys,

35:30.928 --> 35:32.828
they always start
with something small,

35:32.864 --> 35:36.595
just a little quote that they clean up.
And then it's a whole anecdote,

35:36.634 --> 35:39.569
and, pretty soon, they're seeing
some amazing shit.

35:40.138 --> 35:42.572
They're the lucky ones
who just happen to be standing

35:42.607 --> 35:46.202
on the right street corner in Tel Aviv
when the pizza joint blows up

35:46.244 --> 35:48.542
and the human head rolls down the street
with the eyes still blinking.

35:48.579 --> 35:51.980
The pictures were sent to him.
The police have confirmed...

35:52.016 --> 35:55.452
It always starts with something true,

35:55.486 --> 35:57.386
something confirmed.

35:57.421 --> 35:59.116
But then you've got a son of a bitch

35:59.157 --> 36:01.785
who just happens to be walking
in the Guilford entrance

36:01.826 --> 36:03.453
when the mysterious gray van comes...

36:03.494 --> 36:07.294
Gus, this has gotten personal
between you and Scott

36:07.331 --> 36:09.322
and it's affecting your judgment.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.233
I'm moving the story through the state desk.

36:12.270 --> 36:15.034
You should go home, think this through.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.501
We'll talk in the morning.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.281
Maybe you win a Pulitzer with this stuff

36:29.187 --> 36:31.121
and maybe you gotta give it back.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.782
It's in my notes, Gus.
Everything that happened,

36:35.826 --> 36:37.987
everything that guy said when I got to him.

36:38.029 --> 36:40.520
Every last word is in my notes.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.482
Home earlier than I thought.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.047
Yeah. Home.

37:22.039 --> 37:24.269
- He hit again.
- Who did?

37:24.308 --> 37:26.401
The serial killer.

37:26.444 --> 37:28.139
Get a grip, motherfucker.

37:28.179 --> 37:31.046
You don't believe me?
Check out his left wrist.

37:37.588 --> 37:39.579
You fuckin' with me again, Bunk?

37:41.192 --> 37:43.183
Copycat.

37:43.694 --> 37:45.594
Call McNulty. Get him down here.

37:54.972 --> 37:58.738
Been going over the charging documents
on the Partlow-Stanfield drug arrests.

37:58.776 --> 38:02.337
- Problematic to say the least.
- How so?

38:02.380 --> 38:04.007
They grab the phones and, minutes later,

38:04.048 --> 38:07.108
they've cracked an elaborate code
that implicates everyone.

38:07.151 --> 38:09.119
No one's that brilliant,

38:09.153 --> 38:10.780
not at the B.P.D., anyway.

38:12.223 --> 38:13.850
You don't know Lester Freamon.

38:13.891 --> 38:16.018
I know what I know.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.722
And this feels to me like an illegal wiretap.

38:19.397 --> 38:21.558
Your guys were on those phones,
tracking my clients

38:21.599 --> 38:24.625
- long before they went near any drugs.
- Untrue.

38:25.970 --> 38:28.097
We get into discovery
and I'm going to have no problem

38:28.139 --> 38:31.506
knocking down that bullshit
about a source of information.

38:31.542 --> 38:35.205
And my sources around here tell me that,
with all the budget cutbacks,

38:35.246 --> 38:37.737
the only wiretap
you all have had up this year

38:37.782 --> 38:40.273
has been on the homeless killer thing.

38:40.885 --> 38:43.217
Whatever else you're running is illegal.

38:44.055 --> 38:45.750
Sources?

38:45.790 --> 38:48.224
Title threes are supposed to be secret.

38:49.060 --> 38:52.689
Are you saying you have a source
of information inside the courthouse?

38:52.730 --> 38:54.721
It's a figure of speech.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.496
What I'm saying is that
there's shit in the blood of your case,

38:58.536 --> 39:01.232
and, if you wait until this goes past indictments,

39:01.272 --> 39:03.069
I'm gonna run wild with it.

39:04.675 --> 39:06.438
We should talk.

39:06.477 --> 39:08.001
Out of court.

39:11.482 --> 39:12.949
Fuck me.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.353
Is it enough? Do you have enough?

39:17.388 --> 39:20.016
It has to be. It should be.

39:20.057 --> 39:22.218
You can't look at everything
that Robert found,

39:22.259 --> 39:25.319
at the pattern, and not see
what this fucking guy's about.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.354
You know that. I know that.

39:28.399 --> 39:30.424
What, you don't think so?

39:30.468 --> 39:32.333
I think that if you do this,

39:32.370 --> 39:34.463
these son of a bitches will do you.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.431
Come.

39:37.475 --> 39:40.069
Sorry. There's been another homeless murder.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.806
South Baltimore.

39:43.848 --> 39:46.009
Careful, Gus.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.041
I can't protect you.

39:58.596 --> 40:01.224
- No fucking way.
- Dead for a while.

40:01.265 --> 40:04.826
And I can assume, Jimmy,
from the fact that the ribbon ain't red

40:04.869 --> 40:07.963
and the fact that you don't need another body
because Marlo is locked up...

40:08.005 --> 40:12.499
- I got nothing to do with this.
- Wonderful. We've eliminated one suspect.

40:12.543 --> 40:14.033
You see what you started here?

40:14.078 --> 40:16.808
The bosses are gonna toss it
back to you. No doubt.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.179
- The bosses know it's bullshit.
- What?

40:19.216 --> 40:22.549
- Daniels knows. Pearlman, too.
- How the fuck you?

40:25.256 --> 40:28.054
- How much longer does this...
- Can you give us a minute?

40:28.092 --> 40:30.993
You turning the world
upside down with your bullshit.

40:31.028 --> 40:32.893
- How are you not in jail?
- I don't know.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.989
The lie's so big, people can live with it.

40:35.032 --> 40:40.493
Jesus fucking Christ, Jimmy. I told you.
I fuckin' told you it was going to come to this.

40:41.272 --> 40:45.709
You played with fire, didn't you?
And now we're all getting burned...

40:46.777 --> 40:49.837
...reporting live from South Baltimore,
where police have found the body

40:49.880 --> 40:52.212
of what appears to be
another homeless man.

40:52.249 --> 40:55.616
This one killed and left in a vacant lot...

40:55.653 --> 40:58.053
...short while ago have refused so far...

40:58.088 --> 40:59.953
Did somebody not get the message?

41:38.462 --> 41:42.091
You're not killing them yourself, McNulty,
at least assure me of that.

41:46.237 --> 41:48.171
And the one you disappeared?

41:48.939 --> 41:51.271
He's OK, last I checked.

41:51.308 --> 41:55.438
Good. That's a start, I guess.

41:55.479 --> 41:58.971
- I thought you got a message.
- Copycat.

41:59.783 --> 42:01.774
I got nothing on this one.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.411
Jesus.

42:03.454 --> 42:07.049
How did you do it?
How did you get 'em by the medical examiner?

42:07.091 --> 42:10.219
Some were real and I just linked 'em
with the ribbons.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.092
Some I juked as strangle jobs.

42:15.132 --> 42:18.033
- If it matters, I know now...
- Fuck what you know now.

42:18.068 --> 42:22.402
This was all for money, McNulty?
You couldn't live without the O. T?

42:22.439 --> 42:25.306
The Stanfield case. It was that.

42:25.342 --> 42:28.334
I know where it went,
but you got paid, too.

42:28.379 --> 42:31.576
You and Freamon
and maybe a dozen other guys.

42:31.615 --> 42:33.606
It wasn't about the money.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.327
Down the road, when we settle on this,

42:44.361 --> 42:46.625
and we will settle on this,

42:46.664 --> 42:50.862
I don't expect any of you will ever see
another hour of O.T. Again.

42:50.901 --> 42:54.496
I don't expect any of you
will be doing police work ever again.

42:54.538 --> 42:57.268
And the only reason this isn't before
a grand jury right now

42:57.308 --> 43:00.175
is because our mayor can't live with that.

43:00.711 --> 43:03.874
Oh, yeah.
The Mayor knows your name.

43:03.914 --> 43:08.476
So this is your last case. Work it.

43:08.519 --> 43:10.612
If you're half the detective you think you are,

43:10.654 --> 43:13.782
you'll put this one down fast
and take us all off the hook.

43:13.824 --> 43:15.815
The longer this goes on,

43:15.859 --> 43:17.850
the worse the payback's gonna be.

43:35.946 --> 43:37.573
But what does he really know?

43:37.615 --> 43:41.346
What he knows now isn't half
of what he'll learn when we get to discovery.

43:41.385 --> 43:44.445
They won't be able to produce
a credible source of information.

43:44.488 --> 43:48.117
They don't have to if it's not a registered C. I.
A source is only...

43:48.158 --> 43:50.353
If he can raise doubts in a judge's mind,

43:50.394 --> 43:52.692
we could be compelled to reveal our source.

43:52.730 --> 43:54.925
At that point, we're giving up the wiretap.

43:54.965 --> 43:57.160
And he gets the paperwork
from the phone company.

43:57.201 --> 43:59.192
Which has Stanfield's number on it.

43:59.903 --> 44:01.962
God.

44:02.573 --> 44:05.303
The only thing we can do is barter.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.173
Then barter. This can't go to court.

44:07.211 --> 44:08.769
We do have some leverage.

44:09.713 --> 44:11.578
What?

44:12.516 --> 44:16.418
Let's just say Mr. Levy has problems
of his own to deal with.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.646
Make this go away...

44:20.324 --> 44:22.986
and the Mayor will not forget that you did so.

44:24.161 --> 44:25.856
Nor will I.

44:28.465 --> 44:30.933
Jimmy, ass up an' help us with this.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.334
Shit is funky.

44:38.609 --> 44:42.705
- We should take this into the box.
- Where's the pocket contents?

44:42.746 --> 44:46.182
We have questions
about the reported kidnapping...

44:46.216 --> 44:48.411
- Those two bags there.
- Yes, ma'am.

44:50.320 --> 44:52.788
Well, that would seem
to be the newspaper's problem.

44:54.158 --> 44:56.752
I get another fucking call about a gray van,

44:56.794 --> 45:00.195
I'm burning that fucking newspaper building
to the ground.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.696
What?

45:06.336 --> 45:09.169
Your homeless guy from days ago,
what was in his pockets?

45:09.206 --> 45:12.437
- Bullshit.
- You got business cards?

45:12.476 --> 45:14.137
Yeah, but every card has an alibi.

45:14.178 --> 45:16.840
- Let me see.
- I thought we were done with this.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.449
So, where you going with this?

45:31.762 --> 45:34.993
- I think it's down.
- Motherfucker, you ain't that good.

45:36.767 --> 45:39.065
McNulty, what's up with this?

45:42.406 --> 45:44.135
You OK, Gus?

45:46.944 --> 45:48.673
Yeah, I'm good.

45:57.187 --> 45:58.711
What?

46:01.458 --> 46:03.153
Alma, what's up?

46:05.496 --> 46:07.691
- It's empty.
- What's empty?

46:07.731 --> 46:11.462
The pad he waved at you,
saying it was all filled with notes.

46:12.636 --> 46:14.604
It's empty. Every page.

46:16.507 --> 46:18.236
Thanks.

46:38.862 --> 46:41.057
What the fuck is that about?

46:50.607 --> 46:52.905
Alma, TV has police on a sweep
of the homeless

46:52.943 --> 46:55.468
under Hanover street.

47:03.020 --> 47:04.783
I'll get right to the point.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.414
Please do.

47:10.527 --> 47:13.963
- You have Stanfield, right? He's your client?
- Yeah, him and his people.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.794
I have some stuff,
straight from the grand jury

47:15.833 --> 47:18.393
that you're gonna wanna
see sooner rather than later.

47:18.435 --> 47:21.233
- Is this a title three case?
- You'll find it interesting, I promise.

47:21.271 --> 47:24.934
- All right. When can you meet?
- Tomorrow, after work. Same money, right?

47:24.975 --> 47:27.136
- Yeah, the money's the same.
- Good.

47:30.414 --> 47:33.349
We can grand jury
Gary diPasquale tomorrow,

47:33.383 --> 47:36.147
along with that one-party consent call.

47:36.186 --> 47:37.312
Or...

47:38.856 --> 47:40.517
here's the deal.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.083
No court trials.

47:43.126 --> 47:47.460
Partlow pleads to all of the bodies
in the vacants and takes life, no parole.

47:47.497 --> 47:51.024
We'd want the second shooter, too,
but Pearson's beyond that now.

47:51.068 --> 47:54.526
Metcalf and Wagstaff plead
to possession with intent.

47:54.571 --> 47:56.801
Stanfield takes ten years on conspiracy.

47:58.742 --> 48:01.404
You're blackmailing an officer of the court.

48:01.445 --> 48:04.903
The moment you came in here
and offered that quid pro quo,

48:04.948 --> 48:07.382
you were guilty of obstruction of justice.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.282
You're right.

48:09.853 --> 48:11.980
I could get six to eight years.

48:13.423 --> 48:18.190
And for bribery of a state's attorney
and the violation of grand jury secrecy,

48:18.228 --> 48:19.991
you could see ten to twelve.

48:21.698 --> 48:24.667
I'll be out a couple years before you.

48:24.701 --> 48:27.499
You come home,
first round's on me, I guess.

48:27.537 --> 48:31.166
So you'll let me walk
to keep this case out of open court?

48:31.208 --> 48:34.371
That file must be dirty as hell.

48:34.411 --> 48:37.346
The conspiracy charge on Stanfield falls
without the cellphones

48:37.381 --> 48:40.043
and you and I both know
that if someone does some digging,

48:40.083 --> 48:43.575
they're gonna find an illegal wiretap
and you're gonna lose the phones.

48:43.620 --> 48:46.088
Everhart, 274,

48:46.123 --> 48:49.650
Maryland 459, Ceccolini, 435,

48:49.693 --> 48:51.354
US, 268.

48:53.330 --> 48:56.026
Lying cops don't automatically kill a case.

48:56.066 --> 48:58.125
But that's a lot of risk on appeal.

48:59.169 --> 49:01.330
And a lot of dirt for your office to show.

49:02.606 --> 49:05.473
No. You're scared of the light.

49:06.643 --> 49:09.840
Partlow takes his chances
on the legit murder charge only.

49:10.647 --> 49:14.014
The conspiracy count goes
and Stanfield and the rest walk.

49:14.451 --> 49:16.715
Stanfield walks

49:16.753 --> 49:20.780
but the case goes on the stet docket,
not dismissed outright.

49:20.824 --> 49:23.258
And, although I can tell you
there are people in this city

49:23.293 --> 49:25.955
who can't tolerate a scandal
at this particular moment,

49:25.996 --> 49:28.021
that dynamic changes after November.

49:28.065 --> 49:30.260
- The elections.
- After November,

49:30.300 --> 49:34.134
no one is going to care
as much about showing dirt.

49:34.571 --> 49:36.630
If Carcetti wins, he's in Annapolis.

49:36.673 --> 49:39.403
If he loses, he's an incumbent mayor
who can take a hit or two.

49:39.443 --> 49:43.846
So tell Mr. Stanfield that this is
his only window.

49:44.881 --> 49:47.645
Partlow pleads to all the murders

49:47.684 --> 49:50.585
and both lieutenants plead to the drugs.

49:50.620 --> 49:53.088
Then Stanfield retires.

49:53.123 --> 49:54.715
He's done.

49:54.758 --> 49:57.955
We even get the scent of him
on the street ever again,

49:57.995 --> 50:00.623
this case comes off stet and goes to trial.

50:01.064 --> 50:04.261
And if we have to put a few cops in jail
right behind him, so be it.

50:04.301 --> 50:06.462
We'll bring the evidence and take a hit.

50:07.437 --> 50:09.598
Your client walks away now...

50:10.807 --> 50:13.503
or the both of you don't walk at all.

50:37.934 --> 50:39.697
Let's go. Get up.

50:56.086 --> 50:57.678
That's mine.

50:58.922 --> 51:00.753
It's yours. I know.

51:13.403 --> 51:15.200
Do you have a card?

51:25.182 --> 51:27.013
That's not a card.

51:28.985 --> 51:31.783
We met before, d'you remember?

51:31.822 --> 51:33.517
Liar.

51:35.425 --> 51:37.222
Black liar.

51:37.961 --> 51:40.020
Why'd you kill your friend?

51:43.633 --> 51:45.658
He drinks.

51:45.702 --> 51:47.499
He's always drinking.

51:47.537 --> 51:50.233
But you put a ribbon around his wrist.

51:50.273 --> 51:52.002
Like the others.

51:52.943 --> 51:55.673
- Yeah.
- Did you see that on television?

51:56.746 --> 51:58.873
The ribbon on the wrist?

51:58.915 --> 52:01.110
Did you hear about that from other people?

52:01.618 --> 52:03.882
Why'd you do the thing with the ribbon?

52:03.920 --> 52:05.911
Nobody understands.

52:07.858 --> 52:09.849
You don't understand.

52:12.696 --> 52:14.721
I always know what I'm going to do...

52:16.733 --> 52:18.462
before I do it. OK?

52:20.237 --> 52:22.068
I always know what I'm going to do.

52:22.105 --> 52:25.131
Did you kill the others?
Did you kill all of them?

52:25.175 --> 52:27.143
Every one of them.

52:31.081 --> 52:33.709
I did it because I knew I was going to do it.

52:39.389 --> 52:40.947
I've killed millions.

52:42.692 --> 52:45.160
OK? And they all killed me.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.155
So you did all the murders?

52:53.236 --> 52:55.227
You're a coward.

52:57.541 --> 52:59.236
I can tell.

53:01.878 --> 53:03.402
Do you have a card?

53:09.719 --> 53:12.950
Jimmy, reporter's in there waiting
for a photo array.

53:13.990 --> 53:16.618
What? Jay, he's bullshit.

53:17.360 --> 53:20.124
I know he is but the newspaper
made such a fuss,

53:20.163 --> 53:23.257
the major wants us to jerk him off,
just to say we did.

53:37.347 --> 53:39.008
Hey, detective.

53:51.228 --> 53:53.025
No gray van either.

53:54.064 --> 53:56.555
- What?
- He doesn't have a gray van.

54:05.475 --> 54:09.036
No gray van. And he didn't call you
on the phone either, did he?

54:09.079 --> 54:13.641
He didn't call you the first time
and he didn't call you the second. I did that.

54:14.551 --> 54:17.645
Yew mortify me in fronta my fatha...

54:17.687 --> 54:19.416
And those pictures you got.

54:19.456 --> 54:20.946
I took those.

54:20.991 --> 54:23.687
And the missing guy?
He's my second cousin.

54:23.727 --> 54:27.527
We sent him up to Atlantic City
with a roll of quarters.

54:27.564 --> 54:29.759
And you know why I can tell you all this?

54:29.799 --> 54:31.733
Because, you lying motherfucker,

54:31.768 --> 54:34.328
you're as full of shit as I am.

54:34.371 --> 54:37.932
And you've got to live with it and play it out
for as long as it goes. Right?

54:39.142 --> 54:40.871
Trapped in the same lie.

54:42.078 --> 54:44.979
Only difference is I know why I did it.

54:45.015 --> 54:48.416
But fuck if I can figure out
what it gets you in the end.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.442
But hey, I ain't part of your tribe.

54:51.021 --> 54:53.387
- You're not serious? You can't...
- No.

54:54.357 --> 54:56.348
No, I'm a fucking joke.

54:57.661 --> 54:59.458
And so are you.

55:03.433 --> 55:05.697
Now get the fuck out of here.

55:42.105 --> 55:43.766
You walk.

55:44.774 --> 55:48.232
Chris eats the murders, every last one,
takes life without parole.

55:48.278 --> 55:50.007
- No parole?
- No shot.

55:50.046 --> 55:52.241
They've got him cold on the one
with the D.N.A.

55:52.282 --> 55:54.011
Can you sell that? Is Chris loyal?

55:54.050 --> 55:55.711
Yeah.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.151
As long as I take care of his people.

55:59.189 --> 56:02.647
Cheese and Monk are looking
at up to twenty for the drugs.

56:02.692 --> 56:06.924
But there's gonna be no assets investigation
and you come home with all your money.

56:07.864 --> 56:10.196
Why they letting me walk?

56:10.233 --> 56:13.100
They don't wanna
but there's some shit in their case

56:13.136 --> 56:15.400
and they'd rather not show it in court.

56:15.438 --> 56:19.033
But here's the rub.
If you stay in the game,

56:19.075 --> 56:21.009
they will. They definitely will.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.308
Right now, with an election going on,

56:23.346 --> 56:25.314
they're willing to give you a bye.

56:25.348 --> 56:29.045
But after November, if they even think
you're still a player,

56:29.085 --> 56:31.110
they can take this case down off the shelf

56:31.154 --> 56:34.555
and the shit in the case might not be enough
to keep you free.

56:35.191 --> 56:37.159
You understand?

56:37.193 --> 56:39.184
Give up the crown.

56:40.830 --> 56:43.697
Well, that's the deal, kiddo.

56:44.501 --> 56:47.561
There's not a lawyer
who could get better for you.

57:01.918 --> 57:03.909
How'd that go, boss?

57:04.988 --> 57:08.981
Kiddo, you are a gold mine to me.
You know that?

57:09.025 --> 57:11.323
You've taken this law firm
to a whole new level.

57:11.361 --> 57:14.091
- Me?
- You don't tip me to that bad wiretap,

57:14.130 --> 57:17.531
I've got all kinds of trouble.
But now, if Marlo takes the deal,

57:17.567 --> 57:21.833
he's gonna get a walk after being charged
in a multimillion-dollar drug seizure.

57:21.871 --> 57:23.566
That doesn't happen very often

57:23.606 --> 57:25.574
and, when it does happen,
the name and number

57:25.608 --> 57:30.204
of the defense attorney goes in the front pocket
of every respectable drug trafficker.

57:30.246 --> 57:32.373
You're a genius for what
you brought me on this.

57:32.415 --> 57:34.042
I'm just doing what I do, right?

57:34.083 --> 57:36.677
You need to know something,
all you gotta do is ask.

57:36.719 --> 57:38.710
That's what a detective is, right?

57:38.755 --> 57:41.656
Here. You should come over for dinner tonight.

57:42.225 --> 57:44.853
- Yvette's making brisket.
- Your house?

57:45.795 --> 57:47.786
You're mishpocha now.

57:54.237 --> 57:56.068
If you say so.

58:07.150 --> 58:08.708
It's down.

58:08.751 --> 58:12.448
Not that this thing is ever going to trial.
That guy has N.C.R. Written all over him.

58:12.489 --> 58:16.516
Can't argue. A padded room
at Clifton T. Perkins is definitely called for.

58:17.026 --> 58:19.722
- He go for all of them?
- No, sir. Just the last two.

58:19.762 --> 58:22.993
- He deny the others?
- He ain't exactly denying anything in there.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.432
I mean, he'll cop to anything we damn please.

58:25.468 --> 58:27.527
Then go back and get it.

58:27.570 --> 58:29.538
Excuse me?

58:29.572 --> 58:33.303
If he's N.C.R., what the fuck is the difference
if he cops to two or six?

58:33.343 --> 58:35.937
Either way, they tie his arms
and feed him green Jell-o.

58:35.979 --> 58:37.640
Sir, he did the last two.

58:38.948 --> 58:40.882
Motherfucker.

58:41.518 --> 58:45.249
You are a cunt hair away from indictment
and you see fit to argue with me?

58:47.924 --> 58:50.222
I did what I did. I know.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.694
And now I'm standing responsible
for two fresh murders.

58:52.729 --> 58:54.720
I know what I've done here.

58:55.398 --> 58:57.389
But I'm not doing this.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.971
This is over

59:09.012 --> 59:13.346
and all of our citizens can rest soundly
in the knowledge that the man responsible

59:13.383 --> 59:16.910
has been apprehended by
the diligent efforts of investigators.

59:16.953 --> 59:19.979
Mr. Mayor, is he being charged
with all of the murders

59:20.023 --> 59:24.756
- or just two?
- It is my understanding that...

59:27.697 --> 59:29.790
We are charging the last two incidents

59:29.832 --> 59:33.233
but it is my understanding that he is suspected
in all of the crimes.

59:33.269 --> 59:35.203
We're waiting for D.N.A. Test results.

59:35.238 --> 59:38.173
Indications are that he may be
mentally incapacitated

59:38.207 --> 59:42.735
and therefore additional prosecutions
would prove redundant.

59:42.779 --> 59:45.714
I would also like to credit
Deputy Commissioner for Operations Daniels

59:45.748 --> 59:49.206
with not only bringing these cases
to their proper conclusion

59:49.252 --> 59:53.712
but also for solving last year's slayings
in the vacant rowhouses.

59:53.756 --> 59:55.951
He has given us such excellent work

59:55.992 --> 59:58.859
that I think that now is as good a time
as any to announce

59:58.895 --> 01:00:01.591
that we will be sending
the deputy's name forward

01:00:01.631 --> 01:00:05.795
to the city council for confirmation
as Baltimore Police Commissioner.

01:00:08.671 --> 01:00:11.970
Acting commissioner Rawls,
to whom I am also extremely grateful,

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:16.001
will serve in an advisory capacity
pending new responsibilities at City Hall.

01:00:32.395 --> 01:00:34.727
You should be working the main bar
on the arrest with Alma.

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:35.788
I...

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.357
We're going to want
your byline in this coverage.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:41.833
Yeah, I don't feel so well. My stomach...

01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.532
I think I gotta go home.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:47.099
Sorry.

01:01:34.223 --> 01:01:35.986
Having ducked the bullet
on that homeless mess,

01:01:36.025 --> 01:01:40.724
I want you to know that the Mayor
and I both appreciate your discretion.

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:43.231
But right now we can't
take our eyes off the ball

01:01:43.266 --> 01:01:45.962
when it comes to crime overall.

01:01:46.002 --> 01:01:48.835
Looking at your weekly
U.C.R. S from the districts,

01:01:48.871 --> 01:01:52.398
I am not seeing the kind of decline
that's going to measure out

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:54.410
to a ten per cent drop in the quarter.

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:57.004
- They're clean.
- Excuse me?

01:01:57.046 --> 01:01:58.980
The stats are clean.

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:02.275
They're gonna stay clean.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:05.810
Either we fix this Police Department
and the crime goes down

01:02:05.855 --> 01:02:08.380
or we don't and the crime stays up.

01:02:08.424 --> 01:02:12.087
Commissioner, we're talking about a little help

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:14.494
in the next couple quarters. That's all.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.691
No. I can't.

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:21.164
You're quiet on the homeless fiasco
but this makes you squeal?

01:02:21.204 --> 01:02:24.537
Tell the Mayor his stats will be clean

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.305
before the election, after the election.

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.612
You're right. They can't fire you.

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:36.211
Not without it bouncing back on City Hall.

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:39.816
If you don't mind being buried
in some backroom unit,

01:02:39.856 --> 01:02:42.825
you can stay for as long as you can stand it.

01:02:44.227 --> 01:02:46.218
Or until you get the pension.

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:50.988
But, at the same time,
I can't let you do police work.

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:54.002
Not anything that's going to find its way
into a courtroom.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.936
I won't do that.

01:02:56.739 --> 01:02:58.798
For both of you,

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.399
that's over.

01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:10.350
So Marlo walks.

01:03:10.386 --> 01:03:12.217
Or you go to jail.

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.815
And you couldn't do any better with Levy?

01:03:15.992 --> 01:03:17.892
I mean, giving up the money...

01:03:18.728 --> 01:03:20.457
I got what I could.

01:03:24.267 --> 01:03:26.861
You lost the money trail, Lester,

01:03:26.903 --> 01:03:30.304
when you decided to start colouring
outside the lines.

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.409
This isn't on me.

01:03:40.883 --> 01:03:42.942
What the fuck you mean you selling?

01:03:42.985 --> 01:03:45.283
- I'm sellin' the connect.
- How much, yo?

01:03:49.025 --> 01:03:51.084
- Ten million.
- Goddamn.

01:03:52.094 --> 01:03:54.790
Or a high bid if I hear ten
from more than one of y'all.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.232
Y'all think it ain't worth that,
I stick that shit back in my pocket

01:03:58.267 --> 01:04:01.703
and y'all can go back to runnin'
that stepped-on New York shit.

01:04:02.405 --> 01:04:05.374
You don't mind me askin', why you sellin'?

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:10.974
I mean, even from inside here, you can
take a slice for just layin' in the cut, nigger.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.640
Ain't gonna be in here long.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:15.617
Case they got against me already fallin' apart.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:20.886
But the truth is,

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:23.391
I'm done with this gangsta shit.

01:04:23.426 --> 01:04:25.291
I've been there, done that.

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:28.161
You somethin' else other than a gangsta?

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.928
Businessman. Yeah, Tall Man,

01:04:31.968 --> 01:04:34.835
I can't get that shit
wrapped around my head neither.

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:41.909
Anyway, y'all can't get my price up,
maybe y'all pool your money.

01:04:43.079 --> 01:04:46.344
But supply only gonna deal with y'all

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:48.680
after I make the intro.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:51.854
Then I'm out.

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:56.953
You've got a problem.
I thought Daniels was your boy.

01:04:56.993 --> 01:04:59.553
We both got a problem if crime doesn't drop.

01:04:59.595 --> 01:05:02.723
Carcetti loses the statehouse
and you aren't mayor.

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.960
And even if he wins, Nerese, you're stuck

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:07.868
with a Police Commissioner
that won't work with you.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.462
I'm not stuck with anything.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.905
Daniels either comes around or he's done.

01:05:11.941 --> 01:05:15.570
We just anointed him.
We can't go back on that now. He knows it.

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:18.978
Either he learns his place
or he'll be offering to resign.

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:22.579
You ain't the only one
knows how to play this game.

01:05:32.228 --> 01:05:34.628
What to say about this piece of work?

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:39.226
Fucked if I don't find myself
without the right words.

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:42.567
Me, as gifted a golden throat
as any of you cocksuckers

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.403
being loosed from religion,
are ever likely to hear.

01:05:45.441 --> 01:05:47.773
What can I say about the dearly departed?

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:50.674
- I mean, really...
- He died young.

01:05:50.713 --> 01:05:52.704
- Too young.
- Not even 40 years old.

01:05:52.748 --> 01:05:55.546
Though, had it lived,
his dick woulda been 134.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:58.779
Shut up. It's coming to me.

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:04.222
He was the black sheep,

01:06:05.227 --> 01:06:07.161
the permanent pariah.

01:06:07.663 --> 01:06:10.427
He asked no quarter of the bosses
and none was given.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.400
He learned no lessons,

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:14.826
he acknowledged no mistakes.

01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:16.804
He was as stubborn a Mick as ever stumbled

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:19.967
out of the Northeast parishes
to take a patrolman's shield.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.704
He brooked no authority.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:25.441
He did what he wanted to do
and he said what he wanted to say

01:06:25.481 --> 01:06:29.008
and, in the end,
he gave you the clearances.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:33.545
- He's natural police.
- Yes, he was.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:36.888
I don't say that about many people,
even when they're here on the felt.

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:39.554
I don't give that one up
unless it happens to be true.

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:42.593
Natural poh-leece.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:54.204
But Christ, what an asshole.

01:06:57.913 --> 01:07:02.407
And I'm not talkin' about the ordinary,
gaping orifice that all of us possess.

01:07:02.451 --> 01:07:06.410
I mean an all-encompassing,
all-consuming,

01:07:06.455 --> 01:07:10.084
out of proportion to every other facet
of his humanity chasm.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:13.285
From whose borne,
if I may quote Shakespeare,

01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.126
no traveler has ever returned.

01:07:15.164 --> 01:07:17.689
- The fuck did I do?
- Shut the fuck up.

01:07:17.733 --> 01:07:19.724
You're dead to us now.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:24.029
Here's his partner in crime.

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:30.301
Now, now. Be gentle. Be gentle.

01:07:30.346 --> 01:07:32.337
I'm a civilian now. Be gentle.

01:07:32.381 --> 01:07:34.349
Your papers went in?

01:07:34.383 --> 01:07:37.944
- Yeah, this afternoon. 32 years.
- And four months.

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:42.520
Y'all did a fine job with him, you did.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:45.823
He look to be about ten years younger
than I remember.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:49.592
Well, c'mon, there's enough room
for both of you to be laid out.

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:54.293
One at a time.

01:07:54.336 --> 01:07:56.395
You don't crowd a man at his own wake.

01:07:57.773 --> 01:08:00.105
Come on, Lester. Come and snuggle.

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:04.911
Keep our secrets, Jimmy.
I got Shardene with me tonight.

01:08:04.947 --> 01:08:09.281
If you gentlemen will spare us
this unfortunate homoerotic lapse,

01:08:09.318 --> 01:08:11.377
I will conclude my elegiac remarks.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.786
Then do it, you gabby motherfucker.

01:08:14.824 --> 01:08:17.224
To conclude. To conclude,

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:20.386
I say he gave us 13 years on the line.

01:08:20.962 --> 01:08:24.729
Not enough for a pension
but enough for us to know that he was...

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.496
Put the fucking song on.

01:08:26.535 --> 01:08:29.002
...despite his negligible Irish ancestry,

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:31.063
his defects of personality,

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:34.542
and his inconstant sobriety and hygiene,

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.872
a true murder police.

01:08:42.218 --> 01:08:44.152
I say this seriously.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.645
If I was laying there dead
on some Baltimore street corner,

01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:50.557
I'd want it to be you standing over me,
catching the case.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:52.254
Bullshit.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:59.697
Because, brother, when you were good,
you were the best we had.

01:09:02.071 --> 01:09:06.599
Shit, if you was lying there dead on some
corner, it was probably Jimmy that done ya.

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.575
Fuck you! If you caught the case,

01:09:09.612 --> 01:09:11.876
you'd be standing there pissing in my ear.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:36.093
How did Nerese Campbell get it?

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:39.328
You think I asked?
Do you think it even matters?

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:43.065
She gave it to me because
she thought you'd listen to me.

01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:45.130
So now they want me to go.

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:48.571
The way she expressed it
is that she wanted you to stay

01:10:48.611 --> 01:10:50.442
if you could come to your senses.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:52.470
Come to my senses.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:58.119
She wants me to juke the stats for Carcetti,
this quarter and the next,

01:10:58.153 --> 01:11:00.451
hide the crime,
get him elected as governor

01:11:00.489 --> 01:11:03.049
and make her the Mayor.

01:11:03.092 --> 01:11:05.492
So do it.
Burrell juked them before you.

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.085
Warren Frasier before him.

01:11:07.129 --> 01:11:11.122
And, after you're gone,
Rawls or whoever will juke them. So what?

01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.657
I'll swallow a lie when I have to.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.795
I've swallowed a few big ones lately.

01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:21.642
But the stat games, that lie,
it's what ruined this department.

01:11:21.677 --> 01:11:23.804
Shining up shit and calling it gold,

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:26.576
so majors become colonels
and mayors become governors.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:30.016
Pretending to do police work
while one generation fucking trains the next

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.486
how not to do the job. And then...

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.150
I looked Carcetti in the eye.

01:11:39.862 --> 01:11:42.695
I shook his hand.
I asked him if he was for real.

01:11:44.099 --> 01:11:46.124
This is the lie I can't live with.

01:11:46.835 --> 01:11:50.396
If I do, then Nerese has me in her pocket
whenever she wants me.

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:53.408
And I'm no good to anyone like that.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:55.307
Then go.

01:11:55.344 --> 01:11:59.280
Withdraw for personal reasons
or health reasons.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:00.782
Whatever.

01:12:00.816 --> 01:12:03.808
You've got your law degree.
You're not gonna starve.

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.684
But if you don't go,
they'll wreck both of us.

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.919
There's not enough in here to indict me.

01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.756
And the joke of it is,

01:12:12.795 --> 01:12:16.287
I've seen enough the last few days
to have them indicted.

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.197
For what?

01:12:18.934 --> 01:12:22.165
Then use it, Cedric, or at least threaten to.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:24.172
People will get hurt.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.002
People I care about.

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:32.013
Then you're done.
There's enough in that file

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:34.379
that you'll never make it
through confirmation hearings.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:38.250
And enough so that my career is dead
before it even gets started.

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.992
The tree that doesn't bend breaks, Cedric.

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:48.595
Bend too far, you're already broken.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.434
Marlo on a walk.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:56.633
And the money,
she gave that away, too.

01:12:58.173 --> 01:13:00.141
Yeah.

01:13:00.175 --> 01:13:02.109
We don't get to follow the money.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.308
Hey, wonderin' where you was.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.648
I didn't know if I should come out on this here.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.745
Why the fuck not?

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.483
Was me who told Daniels.

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:20.450
I didn't want to do it behind your back but...

01:13:20.496 --> 01:13:22.293
it had to be done.

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:33.300
Anyway, it was great being on the job with y'all.

01:13:35.377 --> 01:13:37.470
I just wanted to say that too, I guess.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:40.310
So what?

01:13:40.349 --> 01:13:42.442
You ain't gonna drink with me?

01:13:44.319 --> 01:13:46.412
I am if you want.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:49.881
Detective,

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.753
if you think it needed doing...

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.524
I guess it did.

01:14:01.937 --> 01:14:03.768
You coming?

01:14:23.826 --> 01:14:25.657
Milton came with 600.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:28.359
And Little Glen is in for three.

01:14:28.397 --> 01:14:30.228
I got five from me

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:32.859
and I got five from Chinaman to cover.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:36.098
- We still short 900.
- I can go that. No thing.

01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:38.868
What? Motherfucker, where you get
that kind of scratch?

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.602
You don't think Cheese know this here game?

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:43.839
We sellin' dope an' coke in Baltimore, nigger,

01:14:43.879 --> 01:14:46.780
any of y'all ain't got that kind of money
need be ashamed.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:50.114
You still puttin' up more
than your share with that.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:53.885
The way I look at it,
we all gonna be more than paid

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:55.583
once we own the connect, so...

01:14:55.624 --> 01:14:58.286
Shit, nigger, we was good
when your uncle had it.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:15:00.591
You had to go ahead and put up with Marlo.

01:15:01.497 --> 01:15:03.590
See that? See now,

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:05.827
that's just the wrong way to look at it

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:09.497
'cause Joe had his time
and Omar put an end to that.

01:15:09.538 --> 01:15:12.063
Then Marlo had his time,
short as it was,

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.041
and the police put an end to that.

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.738
And now, motherfucker, it's our time.

01:15:16.778 --> 01:15:19.246
Mines and yours.

01:15:19.281 --> 01:15:21.943
But instead of just shutting up and kicking in,

01:15:21.984 --> 01:15:24.817
you gonna stand there cryin'
that back-in-the-day shit.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.946
There ain't no back in the day, nigger.

01:15:26.989 --> 01:15:29.355
Ain't no nostalgia to this shit here.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:33.858
There's just the street and the game

01:15:33.896 --> 01:15:35.625
and what happen here today.

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:37.461
You right.

01:15:41.970 --> 01:15:45.269
When it was my uncle,
I was with my uncle.

01:15:45.307 --> 01:15:47.935
When it was Marlo,
I was with him.

01:15:47.976 --> 01:15:49.841
But now, nigger...

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.950
What the fuck did you do that for?

01:15:57.986 --> 01:16:00.386
Now we short the nine.

01:16:00.422 --> 01:16:02.117
That was for Joe.

01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:07.393
This sentimental motherfucker
just cost us money.

01:17:46.728 --> 01:17:48.457
Hey, Alma...

01:17:56.538 --> 01:17:58.438
I just heard.

01:17:58.974 --> 01:18:01.943
The Carroll County bureau?
That's how they punish me?

01:18:01.977 --> 01:18:04.639
Why not just send my ass
all the way to Pennsylvania?

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.614
What'd they tell you?

01:18:06.648 --> 01:18:10.550
That I did an excellent job,
that this had nothing to do with anything

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:13.577
but trying to make
the county bureaus stronger.

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:19.291
Alma, I didn't tell them about the notepad.
I left that part out.

01:18:19.327 --> 01:18:23.229
I told them. When I heard you were in trouble,
I went to Whiting,

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:27.099
told him I thought you were right about Scott.
I told him about the notepad.

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.160
Did he make all of it up?

01:18:29.204 --> 01:18:33.504
- The calls from the killer? The pictures?
- Some, not all.

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:37.004
- Why?
- Look around.

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:40.238
The pond is shrinking.

01:18:40.282 --> 01:18:42.682
The fish are nervous.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:44.709
Get some profile, win a prize,

01:18:44.753 --> 01:18:47.449
maybe find a bigger pond somewhere.

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.719
Whiting, Klebanow, Templeton...

01:18:51.326 --> 01:18:55.626
They snatch a Pulitzer or two
and they are up and gone from this place.

01:18:56.064 --> 01:18:58.123
For them, that's what this is all about.

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:01.396
Me? I'm too fucking simpleminded for that.

01:19:02.671 --> 01:19:06.767
I just wanted to see
something new every day

01:19:06.808 --> 01:19:08.241
and write a story with it.

01:19:10.779 --> 01:19:14.909
Alma, you'll write your way
outta Carroll in no time, watch.

01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:18.852
About as fast as you edit your way
off the copy desk?

01:19:36.104 --> 01:19:38.095
Congratulations, Sergeant Goette.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.641
I know you'll do well in the Eastern.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:49.112
Glad I got to do this at least.
Congratulations, Lieutenant Carver.

01:19:49.151 --> 01:19:53.747
Thank you, sir. I'm just sorry
it won't be you I'm serving under.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.654
Word gets around?

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.817
It's on W.B.A.L. Today.

01:19:57.859 --> 01:20:00.726
They said you're leaving for family reasons.

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:04.129
I guess I got some kids
somewhere I don't even know about.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.031
They say on B.A.L. Who they're sending up

01:20:06.067 --> 01:20:08.399
- as acting commissioner?
- Say it ain't so.

01:20:13.341 --> 01:20:15.502
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:20:15.544 --> 01:20:20.174
as what may be my last official act
as a Baltimore police officer,

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:23.082
allow me to congratulate
all of the promoted officers,

01:20:23.118 --> 01:20:26.849
their families, their fellow officers
and their friends.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:39.094
You ain't careful, they may make you major,
then you'll be truly fucked.

01:20:39.134 --> 01:20:40.431
- Good job.
- Thanks.

01:20:40.468 --> 01:20:41.867
- Proud of you.
- Thanks.

01:20:58.486 --> 01:21:02.946
See now, there you go, giving a fuck
when it ain't your turn to give a fuck.

01:21:02.991 --> 01:21:05.619
- Lehman's squad was up.
- I needed the O.T.

01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:08.322
Yeah, now you got a shooting with no wits,

01:21:08.363 --> 01:21:11.696
no suspect and no prayer
of it going to black.

01:21:11.733 --> 01:21:13.701
Picking up the phone
like a goddamn rookie. Shame on you.

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:16.260
Stop squealin' like a bitch.

01:21:16.304 --> 01:21:18.636
An' make sure you don't step
on that shell casing behind you.

01:21:18.673 --> 01:21:21.301
I ain't gonna kick no shell casings behind me.
It's there on the side.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:25.803
I'm gonna step back and kick no shell casing
you don't mark with letters and numbers.

01:21:29.384 --> 01:21:32.376
I understand.
And you gotta be in the system.

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.446
- They sent you the form.
- They told me that wasn't good enough.

01:21:35.490 --> 01:21:37.481
They said they wanted the other paperwork.

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:40.619
- And you applied for S.S. I., Mr. Belton?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.426
Well, let's go inside
and look it up on the computer.

01:21:43.465 --> 01:21:44.864
Hey, you remember me?

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:51.035
I brought this guy in a few weeks back,
just wanted to see how he was.

01:21:51.072 --> 01:21:53.905
He wandered out after a couple nights.

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:55.534
Sorry.

01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:58.702
Where...

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:02.808
- Where do the homeless go around here?
- Different places. Down by the river,

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.842
over in the warehouse district.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:09.054
Some of the places I don't think
it would be safe for you to go.

01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.786
I'm police. Well, I used to be.

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:13.987
Wait here. I'll see if I can find you a map.

01:22:14.029 --> 01:22:16.293
- Thanks.
- Come on, Mr. Belton.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.966
...and if the major could find his ass
with his hand,

01:22:22.003 --> 01:22:24.972
he'd know that we have more than enough
to be up on a pen register.

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.667
Lieutenant Carver told him so.

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.836
But fuck if he isn't trying
to shut this thing down.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:37.107
Alls I'm sayin' is a phone call or two
and you're gonna find out

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:40.212
that they're getting some kinda pressure
from somewhere to sit on this thing,

01:22:40.255 --> 01:22:43.053
even though we've tied three killings
to this crew.

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:46.690
Does the Police Commissioner know?

01:22:46.728 --> 01:22:51.188
Him? He wouldn't know police work
if it took down his front door on a warrant.

01:22:56.004 --> 01:22:59.201
Just... keep my name out of it.

01:23:01.843 --> 01:23:04.937
New Westport is like Howard Street
ten years ago,

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.675
except the land's cheaper

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:09.707
and there's more potential for mixed use
because of the waterfront location.

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:13.187
- There you are.
- You can't put a price on a water view.

01:23:13.221 --> 01:23:15.246
Yes, you can.

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:17.155
You definitely can.

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:20.059
Andy, he's gotta meet Tommy
and they're leaving early

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.585
so let me borrow him for a moment.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:24.655
Sure, no problem.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Stanfield.

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:29.393
You know who you were talking to?

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.136
Andy Krawczyk.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.574
Very connected. Very big with development
around the harbour.

01:23:35.610 --> 01:23:37.942
He's someone you're gonna wanna know well.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:40.741
But kid, do not...

01:23:42.917 --> 01:23:45.147
Do not get in a room with him alone.

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:48.587
You want me in there with you, believe me,
otherwise guys like that will bleed you.

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:50.853
I want you to meet Tommy Flanagan
before he leaves.

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:53.793
Yeah, gimme a minute. I need to...

01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:55.318
- Bathroom?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:57.297
Down the hall to the right.

01:24:01.536 --> 01:24:04.528
Hey, watch that stuff. You'll put on weight.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.685
But next time, I want you to make sure

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.557
that you watch this money...

01:24:29.297 --> 01:24:30.958
Don't. Don't do it.

01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.531
Time to give that up.

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.634
Do you know who I am?

01:24:42.677 --> 01:24:45.237
Name's Vinson. Used to be Marlo's bank,

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:50.149
but Marlo ain't around no more
and you still moving money for other players,

01:24:50.185 --> 01:24:54.315
so I'm thinking some of that money
need to be mine.

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:57.518
Shit. You just a boy.

01:25:01.096 --> 01:25:03.291
That's just your knee.

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:05.196
That motherfucker shot me.

01:25:11.739 --> 01:25:13.798
Nice doing business, gentlemen.

01:25:19.647 --> 01:25:21.512
No way, that's bullshit.

01:25:21.549 --> 01:25:23.983
I heard it different.
The real story about Omar

01:25:24.018 --> 01:25:26.748
is that a bunch of cops made it look
like them New York boys killed him.

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:29.518
But it was them.
They're the ones that really killed him.

01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:32.151
Listen, motherfucker,
I know what happened to him.

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:36.027
Them police had nothing to do with it.
No New York boys neither.

01:25:36.064 --> 01:25:39.158
So Omar's got an A.K., right?
But he's surrounded.

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:42.966
It's like eight, nine motherfuckers up there
and they all got nines.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:46.462
- But he like, "You all think you..."
- Fuck you lookin' at?

01:25:47.108 --> 01:25:49.906
- You, nigger.
- Do you know who I am?

01:25:49.944 --> 01:25:51.536
Nigger, you know who I am?

01:25:54.015 --> 01:25:55.710
Shit!

01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:22.100
Yeah.

01:27:51.532 --> 01:27:54.126
...on me, all right?

01:28:20.395 --> 01:28:22.158
Thank you. Thank you.

01:28:24.599 --> 01:28:26.567
Thank you.

01:28:26.601 --> 01:28:28.296
This is a great day for Democrats

01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:30.770
and it's a great day for Maryland.

01:28:34.409 --> 01:28:35.933
I hope I get this by e-dot.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:40.209
OK, three minutes, for Christ's sake.
Don't get your panties in a knot.

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:57.757
Commissioner Valchek.

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:18.545
Madam Prosecutor, gentlemen...

01:29:20.321 --> 01:29:23.518
The first case up and I have to recuse myself.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.958
Your Honour, I appreciate your concern.

01:29:44.078 --> 01:29:46.205
Congratulations, Superintendent.

01:29:46.247 --> 01:29:48.442
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you, Governor.

01:29:48.483 --> 01:29:50.508
- Happy to be aboard.
- Thank you.

01:31:18.473 --> 01:31:20.270
Larry.

01:31:34.121 --> 01:31:36.112
Let's go home.
