<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.455 --> 00:07.208
Behold, the incorporated city of Majestic.

00:07.291 --> 00:11.295
A city experiencing a rate of growth
few people could have anticipated.

00:11.378 --> 00:13.339
- Thank you, Mr Groff.
- Sullivan.

00:13.422 --> 00:14.590
Dumb name.

00:14.673 --> 00:16.133
My name is Guillermo.

00:16.216 --> 00:19.762
Tell your friend U-Turn,
you tell him he's a lawn jockey now.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.764
- What the fuck is this?
- Your pot.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.350
You were supposed to pick up
a key of jack.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.517
Heroin?

00:25.601 --> 00:28.437
I'm gonna kill that
bean-farting motherfucker.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.856
- Heroin?
- Chop that shit up.

00:30.940 --> 00:32.357
Bring me back twelve-fi'.

00:32.441 --> 00:35.778
How am I supposed to put food on my table
if you keep upping my debt?

00:35.861 --> 00:37.780
Get a fucking job.

00:37.863 --> 00:39.240
You're a very beautiful woman.

00:39.323 --> 00:41.700
I bet you look good
rolling right out of bed in the morning.

00:41.784 --> 00:44.537
You know, if I hire you, I'll be paying
for the right to make comments like that.

00:44.620 --> 00:45.621
You OK with that?

00:45.704 --> 00:47.957
As long as you're OK
with being shot down every time.

00:48.040 --> 00:50.626
- Can you grow here?
- Hell, yeah, it's perfect.

00:50.709 --> 00:52.795
Fucking shame it's all gonna be for U-Turn.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.547
You let me worry about U-Turn.

00:54.630 --> 00:59.176
You know, this community service thing
is totally unsupervised.

00:59.260 --> 01:00.678
I will never let you deal.

01:00.761 --> 01:03.055
You don't have a choice. I know you don't.

01:03.138 --> 01:04.974
Sergeant That is your battle buddy!

01:05.057 --> 01:06.850
I can't wait to kill me some terrorists.

01:06.934 --> 01:10.145
- Are you kidding me?
- This is gonna be great.

01:20.864 --> 01:23.534
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:23.617 --> 01:26.203
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:26.287 --> 01:28.789
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:28.873 --> 01:31.417
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:31.500 --> 01:34.003
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:34.086 --> 01:36.755
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:36.839 --> 01:39.174
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:39.258 --> 01:42.136
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:43.262 --> 01:45.890
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:45.973 --> 01:48.517
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:48.601 --> 01:51.270
<i># Where they were put in boxes</i>

01:51.353 --> 01:53.939
<i># And they came out all the same</i>

01:54.023 --> 01:56.525
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:56.609 --> 01:59.153
<i># And business executives</i>

01:59.236 --> 02:01.822
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

02:01.906 --> 02:06.452
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:11.707 --> 02:14.251
OK, hold on.
Now point the camera at my ass. Hurry.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.755
I don't want to see your balls, man!
Tuck them away!

02:17.838 --> 02:21.967
All right. There. There. Fine. Ready? OK.

02:22.885 --> 02:24.929
It's coming. And it's a good one.
Here it comes.

02:25.012 --> 02:26.388
Hey, what is that?

02:26.472 --> 02:28.224
And show time.

02:30.976 --> 02:35.689
- Wow. That was Rodriguez?
- Yeah. And they fucking killed him.

02:35.773 --> 02:39.193
- For trying to light farts?
- They don't need a reason, Doug.

02:39.276 --> 02:41.070
It's Pat Tillman all over again.

02:41.153 --> 02:43.072
I gotta forward this
to my fraternity brothers.

02:43.155 --> 02:46.158
Forward it to Lowell Bergman, all right?
Forward it to Harry Reid.

02:46.242 --> 02:49.495
- Are they Beta Phi Omegas?
- OK, er, I love you.

02:49.578 --> 02:51.956
And I thank you for the pants
and the Chinese food

02:52.039 --> 02:55.125
and, what, 70, 80 bucks that you got here.

02:55.209 --> 02:58.504
But uninformed Doug,
Doug of the disengaged electorate,

02:58.587 --> 03:00.714
that Doug needs to remove
himself from the room,

03:00.798 --> 03:03.259
cos I'm riding the edge here.

03:05.803 --> 03:08.722
- Do you want me to answer it?
- That's how they track you.

03:08.806 --> 03:11.100
That's how they got Rodriguez.

03:13.143 --> 03:15.980
If you answer it,
I could be a dead man.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.901
<i>- Hello?
- Mr Botwin.</i>

03:20.985 --> 03:23.404
He's not available right now.
Who, may I ask, is calling?

03:23.487 --> 03:25.406
<i>You know who this is.</i>

03:26.448 --> 03:29.994
- Hmm. What? What?
- Scary. Deep voice.

03:30.452 --> 03:33.205
Very deep. Very scary.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.000
You can't stay here.

03:36.959 --> 03:39.461
They are going to kill you, Andy.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.344
I sold Jesus a quarter ounce
at the Fastmart.

03:47.428 --> 03:49.555
He's a Mexican guy
who's on road kill with me

03:49.638 --> 03:51.348
working off a DUl.

03:51.432 --> 03:54.894
He loves the Lord, and he loves weed.

03:54.977 --> 03:58.564
And so does his cousin Javier,
who works in the kitchen at Amici's.

03:58.647 --> 03:59.899
I only sold him a dime,

03:59.982 --> 04:02.484
but two of the delivery guys
bought a half-ounce each.

04:02.568 --> 04:04.570
Got a free meatball sub.
Does that happen to you a lot?

04:04.653 --> 04:06.864
- Free food?
- Not really.

04:06.947 --> 04:10.034
Happened to me twice today.
Want some jerky?

04:10.117 --> 04:11.327
Thank you, no.

04:11.410 --> 04:15.372
After the sub, I drove back
and checked in with my supervisor,

04:15.456 --> 04:18.334
- and he sent me to bingo.
- Bingo.

04:18.416 --> 04:22.963
At the retirement home, run by church
volunteers and misdemeanour felons.

04:23.047 --> 04:25.633
- Three customers there.
- Mr Mertes.

04:25.716 --> 04:29.303
- You sell to Mertes?
- Any cars follow you?

04:29.386 --> 04:30.512
No.

04:35.893 --> 04:39.063
- You sold $2,000 in a day.
- Impressive, huh?

04:39.146 --> 04:42.608
Temporary. This is not a career path.

04:42.691 --> 04:46.111
- This is a family in crisis.
- And I'm being the good son.

04:47.571 --> 04:50.074
I'm assuming you burned
through your client base.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.825
Kind of.

04:51.909 --> 04:54.745
OK. I'll make some calls.

04:55.538 --> 04:58.624
But if you sell to these people,
you're not the good son.

04:58.707 --> 05:01.627
You're some random punk
who sells for me.

05:01.710 --> 05:05.589
Pick an alias, work your deliveries
around your community service.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.132
Will do.

05:07.216 --> 05:09.552
Give some jerky to your brother.
He's mad at me.

05:09.635 --> 05:12.846
- Why this time?
- I put him in Majestic summer school

05:12.930 --> 05:16.141
to keep him off the streets,
away from drugs.

05:25.693 --> 05:29.321
I love that sound.
Hammer the nails, pour the cement down.

05:29.405 --> 05:32.616
Good men are gonna raise
their families here.

05:33.409 --> 05:38.581
Of course, it's that kind of missionary zeal
that's got us into this mess, isn't it?

05:41.041 --> 05:43.168
We need these sewer lines.

05:44.128 --> 05:46.255
We need these votes.

05:46.338 --> 05:50.801
And the word around town says,
"You get Doug Wilson's vote,

05:50.885 --> 05:53.470
"the rest will follow. "

05:53.554 --> 05:56.849
Well, that's beautiful.
I'm thinking a golf membership.

05:59.059 --> 06:02.146
OK. Now, I know a lot of you
are looking up at this board,

06:02.229 --> 06:05.024
and you're thinking to yourselves,
"Critical thinking?"

06:05.107 --> 06:08.402
That sounds kind of square.
Sounds kind of wack.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.613
OK.

06:10.696 --> 06:14.325
Who here can tell Bob
what critical thinking means?

06:15.910 --> 06:18.704
Anybody? Hit me.

06:18.787 --> 06:21.624
"Critical thinking is
the process of conceptualising

06:21.707 --> 06:23.500
"and analysing information

06:23.584 --> 06:26.170
"gathered from observation
or communication

06:26.253 --> 06:28.714
"as a guide to belief in action. "

06:30.424 --> 06:33.510
- You got a name, friend?
- Shane Botwin.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.387
Dap?

06:37.598 --> 06:38.974
Blow it up.

06:39.058 --> 06:41.060
Pow!

06:41.143 --> 06:43.145
Shane Botwin, let me ask you a question.

06:43.229 --> 06:45.147
Do you want to spend
the next couple weeks

06:45.231 --> 06:49.818
reading out of a textbook,
or would you rather keep it real?

06:49.902 --> 06:51.737
I guess keep it real.

06:51.820 --> 06:55.157
Because I can assign you pages
from the textbook,

06:55.241 --> 06:58.661
and you can copy them into your notebooks,
regurgitate them later for a test.

06:58.744 --> 07:01.747
I mean, I can do that
if that's what you want.

07:01.830 --> 07:03.249
Or...

07:04.625 --> 07:08.003
maybe you and I can solve a murder.

07:08.921 --> 07:10.756
Cool.

07:13.050 --> 07:14.718
Two G's.

07:16.887 --> 07:20.099
- That's right.
- The agreement was twelve-five.

07:20.182 --> 07:26.564
- You breaking a social contract.
- Well, I'm working with some new people.

07:26.647 --> 07:30.859
- It takes time.
- Ten grand light. Usually get a nigga shot.

07:30.943 --> 07:36.448
- Well, good thing I'm white.
- U-Turn, I've been shot! I've been shot!

07:36.532 --> 07:40.244
- What the fuck happened?
- Ow! I was getting the mail.

07:40.327 --> 07:43.622
Truck come by... Blam, blam, blam!
Shot in the ass!

07:43.706 --> 07:46.166
- Hi, Marvin.
- Hi, Nancy.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.586
Y'all two, go outside,
start rousting niggas.

07:48.669 --> 07:52.798
Find out who saw what.
Man, you think it was the Mexicans?

07:52.882 --> 07:55.801
Cucaracha motherfuckers
need to get stomped!

07:55.885 --> 07:58.596
Fuck, man, hey, hey,
you bleeding all over, man!

07:58.679 --> 08:02.099
Put your hand over your ass, man!
Blot that shit, man! Blot it!

08:02.182 --> 08:03.559
I need a doctor!

08:03.642 --> 08:07.104
Man, you ain't getting on
my leather seats with that ass.

08:10.482 --> 08:13.485
No. No, no. No way.

08:15.404 --> 08:17.323
- These one of these hybrids, huh?
- Yes.

08:17.406 --> 08:18.991
How are you doing back there, Marvin?

08:19.074 --> 08:23.120
Got a fucking bullet in my ass!
Take me to the hospital!

08:23.204 --> 08:25.247
Are we sure this is the way to the hospital?

08:25.331 --> 08:27.416
We ain't going to
no motherfucking hospital.

08:27.499 --> 08:29.210
Charge you 50 bucks for an aspirin,

08:29.293 --> 08:32.254
treat you like shit
if you don't have insurance. Make a right.

08:32.337 --> 08:36.467
We got our own guy. Dr Tupelo.
He don't ask no questions,

08:36.549 --> 08:38.802
and he real good at
taking bullets out of people.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.846
Lovely. Can't wait to meet him.

08:40.929 --> 08:44.600
Marvin, what's the gang sign
for those Tres Seis bitches?

08:45.517 --> 08:49.230
- Yeah, that's what I thought. Make a right.
- Who's Tres Seis?

08:49.313 --> 08:52.524
- The Three Sixes.
- Guillermo's crew.

08:52.608 --> 08:55.569
Little bitch is all moody because
he think I jacked his horse.

08:55.653 --> 08:56.695
You did.

08:56.779 --> 08:58.989
That don't give him permission
to shoot you in your ass!

08:59.073 --> 09:00.533
That motherfucker gonna get his.

09:00.616 --> 09:04.411
You don't mean horse like, like...
Horse like "neigh"?

09:05.913 --> 09:09.458
Don't play that doe-eye cute shit with me.
I know you know better.

09:10.876 --> 09:14.630
- Honey, it's going to be OK.
- You buy or lease this car?

09:14.713 --> 09:16.131
I bought.

09:17.132 --> 09:19.260
- How much?
- I don't really recall right now!

09:19.343 --> 09:22.429
There's a man bleeding in my back seat!
I have to pick up my son from summer school!

09:22.513 --> 09:24.682
Here, make another right.

09:25.975 --> 09:28.727
Er, I have to get this. Hello?

09:28.811 --> 09:31.397
<i>I just want to make sure
those packets went out this morning.</i>

09:31.480 --> 09:33.816
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.
- Liar!

09:33.899 --> 09:36.068
- Who's that?
- Who the fuck is you, nigga?

09:36.151 --> 09:39.154
Oh... Oh, sorry, I'm losing you. Bye!

09:39.238 --> 09:42.700
- Make another right and slow down.
- OK, now we're driving in a circle.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.036
Yeah, but we're about
to go straight in a second.

09:48.998 --> 09:50.791
Yeah, motherfucker!

09:54.587 --> 09:56.714
<i># Let's drive away</i>

09:56.797 --> 09:59.925
<i>- Drive, bitch, drive!
- # Let's hit the road</i>

10:02.136 --> 10:05.723
<i># Save our lives, save our lives</i>

10:05.806 --> 10:08.017
<i># Save our lives #</i>

10:08.100 --> 10:11.270
We need these sewer lines.
We need these votes.

10:12.605 --> 10:14.440
And the word around town says,

10:14.523 --> 10:17.985
"You get Celia Hodes' vote,
the rest will follow. "

10:19.403 --> 10:22.865
I hear Doug Wilson
is getting a golf membership.

10:24.617 --> 10:27.703
I love a woman who does her homework.

10:27.786 --> 10:30.331
Would you like a golf membership too?

10:30.414 --> 10:32.791
- I don't play golf.
- Oh, well...

10:33.959 --> 10:36.754
what is it you do play, Celia?

10:36.837 --> 10:39.215
I play house.

10:46.972 --> 10:48.515
Hey, sweetie.

10:49.016 --> 10:52.102
- How was your first day?
- Mostly sucky.

10:52.186 --> 10:56.106
- Oh, only mostly?
- Hello. You must be Shane's mother.

10:56.190 --> 10:57.858
- Hi.
- Yeah, hi.

10:57.942 --> 11:03.405
Eve Meriweather, education coordinator.
Well, Shane had a fabulous first day.

11:03.489 --> 11:06.867
- Bob really took a shine to him.
- Bob. That's great.

11:06.951 --> 11:09.537
- What happened to the back seat?
- Mom spilled some coffee.

11:09.620 --> 11:13.541
And this is for you.
It's just some forms and permission slips.

11:13.624 --> 11:15.251
It covers everything you'll need to know

11:15.334 --> 11:18.045
about the Absolute Truth Ministries
campus.

11:18.128 --> 11:23.050
We got some super-great programmes,
prayer-power meetings.

11:23.133 --> 11:26.470
And not just for Shane,
but for the whole family.

11:26.554 --> 11:29.056
You're a Jewish, right?

11:29.139 --> 11:31.433
Erm, no. I'm not.

11:31.517 --> 11:34.520
Shane's father was a Jewish.

11:34.603 --> 11:37.731
- Did he pass?
- Most people thought he was Italian.

11:39.567 --> 11:41.944
Yes! Yes, he's no longer with us!

11:42.027 --> 11:44.113
- Yes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:44.196 --> 11:47.408
- Losing your husband. I just can't imagine.
- Yeah.

11:47.491 --> 11:49.410
- Well, God bless you.
- Are these shell casings?

11:49.493 --> 11:52.162
Oh, Eve, in a rush!
Gotta go. Gotta make dinner.

11:52.246 --> 11:55.207
- Buckle up, honey.
- All right. See you. Bye!

11:56.709 --> 11:58.752
So, when you cast your vote tonight,

11:58.836 --> 12:01.213
rubber-stamping another
environmental holocaust

12:01.297 --> 12:02.756
in the name of urban renewal,

12:02.840 --> 12:06.927
I want you to remember
the San Acitos dirt shrew.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.015
How could we forget him?

12:11.098 --> 12:14.226
Their beauty was here long before we were.

12:14.310 --> 12:19.064
- This sewer is soaked in their blood.
- Thank you, Jane Chaffin,

12:19.148 --> 12:24.945
er, founder, president, and sole member
of the Agrestic Eco-Warriors.

12:25.654 --> 12:28.866
Your passion humbles us.

12:28.949 --> 12:32.786
And that concludes
the public debate on Motion 412,

12:32.870 --> 12:36.290
the proposal to expand the sewer
and water reclamation systems

12:36.373 --> 12:39.919
- of Greater Agrestic.
- Let's do this.

12:41.128 --> 12:43.672
- All of those...
- All in favour of more pipe, say aye.

12:43.756 --> 12:45.132
- Aye.
- Aye.

12:45.216 --> 12:47.009
- Aye.
- The ayes have it.

12:47.092 --> 12:49.762
Moment of silence for the dirt shrew.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.889
The motion is passed.

13:02.191 --> 13:06.111
<i># Nice day for a walk in the park</i>

13:08.864 --> 13:11.951
<i>- # Nice day for a drive through the city
- What the fuck did you get?</i>

13:16.121 --> 13:19.875
<i># This world is a warm, sunny park</i>

13:22.169 --> 13:25.839
<i># Ba-da ba, ba, ba ba-da,
ba-da ba, ba ba-da</i>

13:25.923 --> 13:28.467
<i># Ba-da ba, ba, ba-da-bam</i>

13:29.134 --> 13:32.888
<i># Ba-da ba, ba, ba ba-da,
ba-da ba, ba ba-da</i>

13:32.972 --> 13:35.432
<i># Ba-da ba, ba, ba-da-bam</i>

13:37.017 --> 13:40.271
<i>- # Nice day for a talk with your girl... #
- House still for sale?</i>

13:43.357 --> 13:44.650
Andy?

13:45.693 --> 13:49.780
Andy's dead. I'm Bill. Bill Sussman.
Here's your mail.

13:52.575 --> 13:55.077
- How's the army?
- They killed Rodriguez.

13:55.160 --> 13:58.080
Yeah, well, I think I killed a Hernandez.

13:58.831 --> 14:02.251
- That's a wig.
- Yeah, that's all they had at Rite Aid.

14:02.334 --> 14:05.838
Mostly, er, wigs for black women.
Are these bullet holes back here?

14:05.921 --> 14:11.135
What? Oh, those.
I was in a drive-by shooting yesterday.

14:11.218 --> 14:17.141
I was, ha ha, driving the car. This car.
I may be a murderer. Murderess.

14:17.224 --> 14:20.227
Actually, I think we only clipped him,
you know, hit him in the leg.

14:20.311 --> 14:23.063
- Hit who in the leg?
- One of the Mexicans. Tres Seis.

14:23.147 --> 14:25.149
- They shot Marvin.
- Who's Marvin?

14:25.232 --> 14:27.568
I'm scrubbing his blood
out of the back seat.

14:27.651 --> 14:31.113
It won't come out.
I tried everything! Nothing works!

14:32.615 --> 14:34.783
Are you OK?

14:34.867 --> 14:37.328
- Actually, Andy...
- Bill Sussman.

14:37.411 --> 14:39.288
I think I am OK.

14:39.371 --> 14:43.375
I mean, stuff keeps piling on,
piling on, piling on.

14:43.459 --> 14:45.502
And while tomorrow is another day,

14:45.586 --> 14:49.465
I'm pretty sure something even more
heinous is gonna happen to me,

14:49.548 --> 14:52.885
because that just seems
to be the way it rolls!

14:52.968 --> 14:55.554
I really think I'm finding myself.

14:57.473 --> 15:00.517
Look at my hand. Nerves of steel.

15:00.601 --> 15:04.063
- Pretty steady.
- That's what I'm talking about.

15:04.146 --> 15:06.982
Well, er, this is all good.

15:07.066 --> 15:10.528
Meanwhile, a reconnaissance drone
killed my battle buddy,

15:10.611 --> 15:13.239
and I'm going to die. I know too much.

15:13.322 --> 15:16.951
I was hoping for a shower,
maybe a little nap.

15:17.034 --> 15:19.328
Erm...

15:19.411 --> 15:23.666
But you obviously are having
a slow psychotic breakdown,

15:23.749 --> 15:26.585
so I'll just ask, do you have any money?

15:29.713 --> 15:32.925
No, I don't.

15:33.008 --> 15:37.054
Er, I have a back seat full of blood.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.766
I have two licence plates
I may have to remove.

15:40.849 --> 15:43.686
I have an assistant's job
that a monkey could do.

15:43.769 --> 15:46.021
I have a death wish.

15:46.105 --> 15:48.232
You're welcome to
any of those sparkly gems.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.818
But as far as money goes, Bill,

15:51.694 --> 15:54.488
everything that comes in goes out.

15:54.572 --> 15:56.448
I'm gonna go now.

15:57.491 --> 15:59.118
I like this new you.

15:59.201 --> 16:02.288
She's a winner.

16:05.958 --> 16:09.086
- Tell the kids I miss them.
- You betcha.

16:14.592 --> 16:16.844
Where you hear that?

16:17.553 --> 16:20.639
You sure about that? That's good news.

16:20.723 --> 16:21.891
Cool.

16:23.642 --> 16:26.437
- And?
- Gunfire in the streets.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.564
Brown fighting black, black fighting brown,

16:28.647 --> 16:31.692
all on account of somebody
went and shot Marvin in the ass.

16:31.775 --> 16:34.695
Something about a Mexican
in a tinted truck

16:34.778 --> 16:37.573
driving up, and pop, pop, pop.
Right in Marvin's ass.

16:37.656 --> 16:39.450
That's one big ass.

16:40.284 --> 16:44.038
Maybe if that Mexican had better aim,
he wouldn't have needed three shots.

16:44.121 --> 16:47.958
Maybe if he hadn't used his antique
snub-nose piece of shit, you'd be right.

16:48.042 --> 16:50.669
- Hmm.
- Still, war is on.

16:51.212 --> 16:52.838
War is on.

16:54.173 --> 16:58.010
- More males?
- I think that's the last of them.

17:00.971 --> 17:02.765
Now, why are you doing that?

17:02.848 --> 17:06.185
Gotta separate the males from the females,
or they'll fuck up the whole crop.

17:06.268 --> 17:09.730
How you know they males?
They got little plant dicks?

17:09.813 --> 17:12.233
No dicks, just sacks.

17:13.358 --> 17:17.780
- Plants looking good in there.
- That's cos it's a roomful of women.

17:21.325 --> 17:22.826
Stepping up.

17:25.996 --> 17:29.416
And we're sitting out there like lambs.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.919
And Rodriguez,
he's got the cell phone up in his hands,

17:32.002 --> 17:35.381
just like that, and that's when it struck.

17:37.174 --> 17:41.011
Right in the chest, into his heart. Tell them.

17:49.853 --> 17:52.231
- What did he say?
- He says, "Wow. Shocking. "

17:52.314 --> 17:54.191
Shocking, shocking.

17:54.275 --> 17:58.445
A naive kid, a great kid,
who only wanted to serve his country.

17:58.529 --> 18:04.076
My battle buddy. And shit like this,
these accidents going on all the time.

18:04.159 --> 18:07.454
And we sit here wrapped
in our blanket of apathy,

18:07.538 --> 18:11.250
eating our vindaloo,
watching Dancing With The Stars,

18:11.333 --> 18:13.460
and we don't wanna know about it.

18:15.629 --> 18:18.424
"No way. That stuff happens over there. "

18:22.052 --> 18:25.097
You tell that to Rodriguez.
Tell it to his fucking corpse.

18:33.439 --> 18:35.190
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, you.

18:38.986 --> 18:41.780
- Got a lot of calls from clients today.
- Yeah?

18:41.864 --> 18:45.576
People seem to like the new guy. Judah.

18:46.327 --> 18:48.662
Tip of the hat to the old man.

18:51.540 --> 18:55.544
- We're gonna need more product soon.
- I'm having homework issues.

18:55.628 --> 18:57.588
Come here, let me see.

18:59.340 --> 19:01.008
"The day after prom,

19:01.091 --> 19:04.011
"a murder has taken place
and blood has been found.

19:04.094 --> 19:07.806
"Principal Paul calls up
detective Dan to investigate. "

19:07.890 --> 19:09.767
It's like an episode of CSI.

19:09.850 --> 19:12.645
I have to use my powers of critical thinking
to solve a murder.

19:12.728 --> 19:14.355
- Who's that?
- That's Kyle.

19:14.438 --> 19:17.733
He disappeared right after the murder.
This is Jill.

19:17.816 --> 19:19.902
Her blood matches the blood
found at the crime scene.

19:19.985 --> 19:22.154
And this is Mia, the cheerleader.

19:22.238 --> 19:25.658
Kyle promised to take her to the prom,
then dumped her hard.

19:25.741 --> 19:27.243
Jealous Mia murdered Jill.

19:27.326 --> 19:29.662
- That's what I thought too.
- So what's the problem?

19:29.745 --> 19:33.332
Every day, we get new clues,
and today we got this one.

19:33.415 --> 19:37.795
"Two days later, Jill arrived at school. "

19:38.254 --> 19:41.590
- I thought Jill was murdered. That's bogus.
- No body, no murder.

19:42.716 --> 19:44.176
It doesn't add up.

19:45.594 --> 19:47.972
- W-W-V-M-D.
- W-W-V...

19:48.055 --> 19:50.224
What would Vic Mackey do?

19:50.307 --> 19:53.477
He'd plant evidence
and coerce a confession.

19:53.561 --> 19:56.564
OK, but what's Detective Dan gonna do?

19:56.647 --> 20:00.568
Drink myself into a stupor,
then sleep with my prostitute-slash-informer.

20:03.153 --> 20:05.114
No more cable for you.

20:06.031 --> 20:09.451
- Mr Botwin.
- This is my lawyer, Dean Hodes.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.912
Gentlemen, we called this meeting
because my client's tired of running.

20:11.996 --> 20:14.081
- We don't care.
- Go fuck yourself.

20:14.164 --> 20:16.876
You're in possession
of US military hardware, Mr Botwin.

20:16.959 --> 20:19.879
- Where's the phone?
- My client neither confirms nor denies...

20:19.962 --> 20:21.714
- Shut up.
- Suck yourself.

20:21.797 --> 20:23.465
I'm setting in front of you documents

20:23.549 --> 20:26.135
which, when signed,
will honourably discharge you

20:26.218 --> 20:31.307
- from the United States Army Reserves.
- You're the drone guy, right?

20:31.390 --> 20:33.267
Lawyer for the contractor?

20:33.350 --> 20:37.271
Your machine killed Rodriguez.
You forced him out in the field.

20:37.354 --> 20:41.108
We were gonna strap that cell phone to a
fucking mule till we found your two sorry asses.

20:41.192 --> 20:43.152
And then we figured,
why waste a good mule?

20:43.235 --> 20:46.697
Private Rodriguez died a hero.
Sign the documents, Mr Botwin.

20:46.780 --> 20:47.781
I'll need to look these over.

20:47.865 --> 20:49.533
There's no time to look over anything,
Mr Hodes.

20:49.617 --> 20:50.910
Suck yourself.

20:50.993 --> 20:54.413
You see that window washer outside,
cleaning the windows, Mr Botwin?

20:54.496 --> 20:58.000
- Notice anything unusual?
- I don't know. Should I?

20:58.083 --> 21:01.337
- He's a white guy?
- Actually, he's a Lithuanian.

21:01.420 --> 21:03.214
And that squeegee he's holding is a remote,

21:03.297 --> 21:06.342
currently erasing
your hard drive, Mr Wilson.

21:06.425 --> 21:08.719
Would you confirm that for me?

21:11.847 --> 21:13.057
Whoa.

21:13.140 --> 21:17.102
That's because that window washer
is not a window washer.

21:17.186 --> 21:18.896
He works for us.

21:19.939 --> 21:22.358
And that janitor in the hallway,
he works for us too.

21:22.441 --> 21:25.110
Turn on your vacuum, Ivan.

21:25.194 --> 21:27.238
Turn it off.

21:27.321 --> 21:28.906
Turn it on.

21:28.989 --> 21:30.741
Turn it off.

21:31.659 --> 21:35.454
- Two vans in the parking lot, helicopters.
- You're fucking surrounded, dipshit.

21:35.538 --> 21:39.041
And we can make you disappear
faster than a mule can shit itself.

21:39.124 --> 21:42.503
- What's with him and the mules?
- Do you think we're fucking around here?

21:42.586 --> 21:46.507
- You return our property pronto, dickhead!
- Give him the phone.

21:46.590 --> 21:48.926
Give him the phone, Doug!

21:49.885 --> 21:51.178
Doug.

21:53.347 --> 21:55.224
Erm, what am I signing here?

21:55.307 --> 21:58.227
You're not signing anything.
You're not here right now.

21:58.310 --> 22:01.522
You were never at Fort Irwin, and the only
man named Rodriguez you know

22:01.605 --> 22:04.108
is some asshole in the Yankees
who thinks he's better than Graig Nettles.

22:04.191 --> 22:05.609
Suck yourself.

22:09.488 --> 22:12.575
OK, you have walked the crime scene.

22:13.492 --> 22:17.454
You've interrogated your suspects.
You've gathered your evidence.

22:17.538 --> 22:21.584
Which one of you is ready
to put your critical mind

22:21.667 --> 22:23.752
to the ultimate test?

22:23.836 --> 22:29.091
Who here has solved
the strange case of Cordull High?

22:34.263 --> 22:39.435
Crimes are solved by hard evidence.
Blood samples point to Kyle and Jill,

22:39.518 --> 22:43.188
but since both of them
showed up at school later,

22:43.272 --> 22:45.649
there can be only one solution.

22:47.193 --> 22:49.111
There was no murder.

22:49.195 --> 22:54.450
Ah, but there was.
A murder of the worst kind.

22:54.533 --> 22:58.204
For, you see, Jill had an abortion.

23:03.876 --> 23:07.588
Jesus, have mercy on their souls.

23:07.671 --> 23:11.217
It's horrible, it's disgusting,
but I have no place else to put you.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.428
You're just gonna have to fake it for a bit.

23:31.278 --> 23:32.863
Hey, Mom.

23:33.155 --> 23:36.659
- What's up, Nance?
- What are you doing here?

23:36.742 --> 23:41.330
Er, just dropping off some business,
getting a rundown on the operation.

23:41.413 --> 23:44.583
- Meeting the family.
- Uncle Andy's back.

23:44.667 --> 23:47.086
And he has a bag of ice on his balls.

23:48.212 --> 23:50.339
- What's up, little man?
- Hey.

23:50.422 --> 23:52.508
Shane, go in the house with your brother.

23:52.591 --> 23:55.803
Listen to your mother, Shane.
She's a gangster. She'll keep you straight.

23:55.886 --> 23:57.930
U- Turn, why don't you and I
have a little walk and talk?

23:58.013 --> 24:01.308
You can't come to my house.
You're not welcome here.

24:01.392 --> 24:03.852
Come on, girl, we tight, you and me.

24:03.936 --> 24:06.647
- I'm not fucking kidding.
- Save it.

24:06.730 --> 24:09.567
I was just dropping off
some bricks for your boy.

24:09.650 --> 24:11.735
Oh, and I left you a package in the garage.

24:11.819 --> 24:14.780
I need you to hold on to it
for a spell, that's all.

24:14.864 --> 24:17.908
Things are starting to heat up over the hill.

24:19.702 --> 24:21.537
You bought a Prius?

24:22.496 --> 24:26.125
I bought seven of them.
I got my whole crew driving them.

24:26.208 --> 24:29.503
They're real quiet.
Good for sneaking up on motherfuckers.

24:32.214 --> 24:34.383
Check this out. Hands-free.

24:37.052 --> 24:39.889
<i>- What up, doe?
- Where you at, U-Turn? You late.</i>

24:39.972 --> 24:43.893
Your bitch ass gonna have to wait.
I got business going on. Fuck you.

24:44.935 --> 24:46.854
See the shit I'm surrounded by?

24:46.937 --> 24:50.107
That's why I need more bitches
like you, Nancy. Oh...

24:51.942 --> 24:53.652
and you could use this.

24:55.487 --> 24:57.198
Watch it tonight.

25:22.765 --> 25:24.600
Heroin.

25:33.317 --> 25:34.860
<i># One, two, three, four!</i>

25:39.740 --> 25:41.075
<i># Ohh!</i>

25:42.868 --> 25:44.411
<i># Ohh, ah!</i>

25:44.912 --> 25:48.207
<i># You can tell from the scars on my arms
And the cracks in my hips</i>

25:48.290 --> 25:50.709
<i># And the dents in my car
And the blisters on my lips</i>

25:50.793 --> 25:52.878
<i># That I'm not the carefullest of girls</i>

25:52.962 --> 25:56.215
<i># You can tell from the glass on the floor
And the strings that are breaking</i>

25:56.298 --> 25:58.968
<i># And I keep on breaking more
And it looks like I am shaking</i>

25:59.051 --> 26:01.053

But I don't think that you'd believe me</i>

<i># It's not the way I'm meant to be</i>

26:09.812 --> 26:12.147
<i># It's just the way the operation made me</i>

26:14.275 --> 26:16.861
