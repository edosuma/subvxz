WEBVTT

00:55.514 --> 00:58.176
(distant coughing)

01:09.737 --> 01:11.853
You found them like this?

01:16.369 --> 01:19.281
I came to see Karen...

01:20.957 --> 01:23.118
...and I saw the blood on the floor.

01:25.795 --> 01:28.081
Then I smelled them.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.505
Somebody dragged them out here

01:32.677 --> 01:35.919
and set them on fire.

01:36.097 --> 01:39.134
They killed them
and set them on fire!

01:43.104 --> 01:44.935
You're a cop.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.812
You find out who did this
and you bring 'em to me.

01:46.983 --> 01:48.974
You understand?
You bring 'em to me.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.483
We'll find out who--

01:51.654 --> 01:54.361
- I need to say it again?
- No. No.

01:54.532 --> 01:57.444
I know what you're feeling.
I've been there.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.200
You saw me there.
It's dangerous.

02:00.371 --> 02:01.611
- Karen didn't deserve this.
- No.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.620
David didn't deserve it.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.827
- Nobody does.
- All right, man, let's--

02:06.002 --> 02:08.709
Man, I ain't going nowhere
till I find out who did this!

02:14.093 --> 02:17.005
We're on the same side, man.

02:17.179 --> 02:18.794
Hey, look,

02:18.973 --> 02:21.385
I know what you're going through.

02:23.269 --> 02:25.601
We've all lost someone.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.477
We know what you're going
through right now,

02:27.648 --> 02:29.764
but you've got to calm down.

02:29.942 --> 02:31.773
You need to step the hell back!

02:33.988 --> 02:35.819
She wouldn't want you being like this.

02:35.990 --> 02:38.948
Stop! Stop!

02:39.952 --> 02:41.453
Carol:
Stop!

02:41.620 --> 02:43.997
(grunting)

02:44.165 --> 02:46.201
Daryl:
That's enough.

02:46.375 --> 02:47.831
That's enough.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.292
(grunts)

02:54.467 --> 02:55.456
- Daryl: Rick.
- ( Tyreese groans )

02:57.803 --> 02:59.304
- Stop.
- Let go of me!

02:59.472 --> 03:01.633
- No. No.
- Let go of me!

03:01.807 --> 03:03.308
No.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.723
(sobbing )

03:15.946 --> 03:17.777
(theme music playing )

03:54.318 --> 03:56.980
This is gonna be sprained
at least a week.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.145
(winces)

04:00.866 --> 04:04.529
Good news, none of these cuts
need stitches.

04:06.372 --> 04:09.910
lwouldn't plan on much
typing the next few days.

04:11.210 --> 04:13.201
You okay?

04:14.880 --> 04:17.041
It hurts.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.253
I wasn't talking
about the hand.

04:21.887 --> 04:25.050
We just went through
something terrible.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.011
Everything we've been
working so hard to keep out,

04:28.185 --> 04:31.393
it found its way in.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.021
No.

04:35.192 --> 04:37.569
It's always there.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.238
Council meeting tomorrow morning.

04:43.409 --> 04:46.242
Thought you should know.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.123
Wejust lost
12 of our own.

04:50.291 --> 04:53.124
Two more we killed in cold blood.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.626
We could be facing an outbreak.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.208
I think I've done
enough damage for one day.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.591
I've fallen off
the wagon before.

05:02.761 --> 05:06.094
- That's what this is?
- Pretty close.

05:06.265 --> 05:09.678
When it happened, I didn't stand around
feeling bad about it.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.717
I got back up.

05:11.896 --> 05:13.511
I had responsibilities.

05:13.689 --> 05:16.271
People to keep safe.

05:18.611 --> 05:21.273
(grunting)

05:36.670 --> 05:38.786
Let's get you cleaned up, man.

05:38.964 --> 05:42.081
You might even need
a couple stitches.

05:42.259 --> 05:45.467
Not until they're in the ground.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.754
You should at least let Hershel
or Dr. S. take a look at you,

05:47.932 --> 05:49.092
make sure nothing's broken.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.472
When they're in the ground.

05:55.481 --> 05:57.722
(grunting)

06:11.205 --> 06:13.036
I'm gonna be okay, though, right?

06:14.792 --> 06:17.454
I mean, Karen and David,
they were already sick.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.869
So if we were gonna get it,
we'd have had it by now.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.163
It doesn't happen on a timeline.

06:22.341 --> 06:25.128
It's different with everyone.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.673
But we could be okay.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.838
Yeah, we could be.

06:31.016 --> 06:33.803
Everything could be okay.

06:36.230 --> 06:38.471
If it's walkers,
if it's people,

06:38.649 --> 06:41.140
we can do something.
We can fight.

06:41.318 --> 06:44.481
But with this,
I'm just digging graves.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.856
(coughing)

06:59.003 --> 07:02.040
Got to see Dr. S.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.505
I'm gonna be okay.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.685
( panting )

07:28.907 --> 07:31.239
Dr. S....?

07:32.870 --> 07:36.408
(people moaning, coughing)

07:45.424 --> 07:48.416
(coughing)

07:55.434 --> 07:58.517
Dr. S.?

07:59.772 --> 08:02.479
(growling)

08:05.569 --> 08:07.400
Dr. S.:
We have to tell them.

08:10.783 --> 08:13.399
lt's starting.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.950
Hershel:
lt's spread.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.287
Everyone who survived
the attack in cell block D.

08:22.461 --> 08:25.624
Sasha, Caleb, and now others.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.459
Oh, Jesus.

08:27.633 --> 08:29.169
So what do we do?

08:29.343 --> 08:32.506
First things first.
Cell block A is isolation.

08:32.680 --> 08:36.013
We keep the sick people there
like we tried with Karen and David.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.172
What the hell we gonna do about that?

08:37.351 --> 08:38.761
Ask Rick to look into it.

08:38.936 --> 08:40.801
Try to make a timeline--
who was where when.

08:40.979 --> 08:43.140
But what are we gonna do
to stop this?

08:43.315 --> 08:44.851
There is no stopping it.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.687
You get it,
you have to go through it.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.352
- But itjust kills you?
- The illness doesn't.

08:50.531 --> 08:53.147
The symptoms do.
We need antibiotics.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.941
We've been through
every pharmacy nearby.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.485
And then some.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.370
That veterinary college
at West Peachtree Tech,

09:00.541 --> 09:04.159
that's one place people may not have
thought to raid for medication.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.043
The drugs for animals
there are the same we need.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.875
That's 50 miles.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.505
Too big a risk before.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.212
Ain't now.
I'm gonna take a group out.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.047
Best not waste any more time.

09:14.221 --> 09:15.210
I'm in.

09:15.389 --> 09:17.380
You haven't been exposed.

09:17.558 --> 09:19.298
Daryl has.
You get in a car with him...

09:19.476 --> 09:21.091
He's already given me fleas.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.511
( chuckles )
I can lead the way.

09:23.689 --> 09:25.099
I know where everything's kept.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.935
When we're out there,
it's always the same.

09:31.113 --> 09:32.774
Sooner or later we run.

09:34.283 --> 09:36.490
I can draw you a map.

09:36.660 --> 09:39.823
There are other precautions
| feel we should take.

09:39.997 --> 09:41.487
Carol:
Like what?

09:41.665 --> 09:45.624
There's no telling how long it'll be
before Daryl and his group return.

09:45.794 --> 09:48.581
Wouldn't it make sense for us
to separate the most vulnerable?

09:48.756 --> 09:50.712
We can use
the administration building.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.419
Separate office,
separate room.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.505
Who is the most vulnerable?

09:55.679 --> 09:57.920
The very young.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.347
What about the old?

10:02.895 --> 10:05.762
(squeaking )

10:05.939 --> 10:07.895
(gurgling)

10:08.901 --> 10:10.516
Give me another go at it.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.275
The whole line's mudded up.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.936
The end is dragging
the bottom again.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.400
We'll have to go out there and clear it.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.861
Set the bird,
go out through the tombs,

10:19.036 --> 10:20.697
swing around through
the forest route.

10:20.871 --> 10:24.329
We got enough for now.
That's tomorrow's problem.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.958
Rick, five more people have come down
with it since Sasha went in.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.789
There's not a lot of us left.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.124
What if you get sick?
What if I do?

10:32.299 --> 10:34.460
What if we get in trouble out there
and don't come back?

10:34.635 --> 10:36.671
Let's get this up
to the people who need it.

10:36.845 --> 10:39.086
Let's get what
we have to get done first.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.137
ls Carl pretty pissed about
going into quarantine?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.892
Of course.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.645
But it's better to be safe.

10:51.193 --> 10:53.605
Always better to be safe.

10:54.780 --> 10:56.736
You should talk to him.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.398
We should both pay our respects.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.738
I'll take this up first.
Meet you.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.979
I'm sorry about what happened.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.895
What I did to you.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.194
Everything.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.777
It's on both of us.

11:43.078 --> 11:45.569
You got to find who did this.

11:45.747 --> 11:48.159
I didn't know David much.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.824
Did you?

11:51.962 --> 11:54.704
Did anyone have a problem
with him or Karen?

11:54.882 --> 11:57.715
No. No way.

11:57.885 --> 11:59.591
l was with her
all the time, every day.

11:59.761 --> 12:02.798
She got along with everybody.
Same with David.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.803
They were the only two
who were sick.

12:09.187 --> 12:12.315
The person who did it might have trying
to stop this thing from spreading.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.734
They didn't.

12:20.198 --> 12:23.110
Now Sasha has it.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.623
Look, whoever it was who did this,

12:28.790 --> 12:31.327
they're not going anywhere.
We'll find them.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.366
Today? Right now?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.501
Because I'm not feeling the urgency.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.049
All | see you doing is pumping water.

12:39.426 --> 12:43.715
In fact, what I'm picking up is
murder is okay in this place now.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.005
No, it is not.

12:46.183 --> 12:47.889
But we have to save lives first.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.016
We have to keep this place going.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.052
You worry about that.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.391
l'll worry about what's right.

12:58.362 --> 13:00.694
(coughing)

13:26.598 --> 13:28.099
It's for your own good.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.767
I'm fine.

13:29.935 --> 13:31.641
I don't want to be locked
away with a bunch of kids.

13:31.812 --> 13:35.350
I need you in there keeping an eye
on Judith and everybody else.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.685
Making sure they're safe.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.731
If anybody gets sick,
you let me know.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.992
What if they've already
turned when | find them?

13:54.209 --> 13:58.122
You don't fire
unless you absolutely need to.

13:58.296 --> 14:01.834
But you know
I might need to, right?

14:15.439 --> 14:18.021
It's gonna be okay.

14:18.191 --> 14:21.103
(sighs)
It's gonna be okay.

14:22.112 --> 14:23.602
- Glenn?
- Don't.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.442
- Don't-- don't come in.
- What is it?

14:31.163 --> 14:33.779
l have it.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.510
Son of a bitch
is about a quart low.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.679
You still keep it in
the bottom of tower three?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.439
- Yeah.
- I'll go get one.

15:02.569 --> 15:03.854
Hey.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.111
I'm glad you're here.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.442
Where else would I be?

15:08.617 --> 15:10.858
Running off.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.118
You know I'm not running off.

15:25.092 --> 15:28.004
So it's just gonna be me
and you like in the old days?

15:29.513 --> 15:31.629
Yeah, and Bob.

15:31.807 --> 15:34.139
Still, feels like we
could use another person.

15:34.309 --> 15:36.675
- Who else isn't sick?
- We don't ask Rick.

15:36.853 --> 15:39.515
He wants to stay here
with Carl and Little Ass-Kicker.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.101
Keep them safe.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.982
Plus there's plenty
of stuff he could do here.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.269
So who else we got?

15:48.532 --> 15:50.648
(people coughing)

15:55.705 --> 15:57.445
Oh, there you are.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.036
Took me damn near forever to find you.

16:01.044 --> 16:02.079
Whatcha doing?

16:02.254 --> 16:05.337
Somebody needs to stand watch.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.998
Man, I want to find them, too.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.509
Put a bolt in them for what they did.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.262
(faint coughing)

16:15.976 --> 16:17.841
These people are cut off.

16:18.019 --> 16:19.429
Ain't no way anyone's getting in and out

16:19.604 --> 16:21.140
without a whole bunch
of people seeing 'em.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.021
Sasha's in there.
I ain't going nowhere.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.645
Standing guard ain't gonna do no good
unless we come back with them meds.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.659
All right.

16:36.830 --> 16:41.039
We're gassing up by the front gate
in case you change your mind.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.866
Carl:
Where are you going?

17:25.837 --> 17:27.577
I'm down here away from y'all

17:27.756 --> 17:32.125
'cause you kids are supposed
to stay away from me.

17:32.302 --> 17:35.419
I've been walking the halls.
My dad told me to look out for everyone.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.089
Well, you should keep your distance.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.929
You're walking towards the exit.

17:42.103 --> 17:44.480
- I need to go out there.
- To the cell blocks?

17:44.648 --> 17:46.764
To the woods.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.307
So you're sneaking out.

17:48.485 --> 17:50.817
Don't need anyone worrying about me

17:50.987 --> 17:53.649
and l damn sure don't want
someone telling me I can't go.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.688
l can'tjust let you go out
into the woods by yourself.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.368
Let me?

17:57.535 --> 18:00.197
I can't stop you.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.908
But I have to tell my dad.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.697
Go ahead, then.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.537
I'll be out there
by the time you find him.

18:08.838 --> 18:10.169
Hershel.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.086
If you have to go,
then I have to come with you.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.722
- Carl.
- l have to.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.937
(coughing)

18:28.024 --> 18:31.141
I swear, it's just allergies.

18:31.319 --> 18:33.275
- Jeanette.
- They come and go.

18:33.446 --> 18:35.277
- Jeanette.
- Ask anyone from Woodbury.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.439
Jeanette.

18:51.172 --> 18:53.379
( door squeaks)

18:53.550 --> 18:55.541
( bangs)

18:56.928 --> 18:59.044
Lizzy:
Carol...?

19:01.558 --> 19:03.094
Mica said you were here.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.309
I don't feel good.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.732
(coughs)

19:09.899 --> 19:11.730
It's okay.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.609
Don't worry.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.815
Hey, don't worry.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.197
We're gonna get you better.

19:19.367 --> 19:21.858
You just go in there and lie down.

19:22.037 --> 19:24.278
Will you tuck me in?

19:28.209 --> 19:30.165
You know my friend Glenn?

19:30.337 --> 19:32.202
He's the best tucker I know.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.872
And he'll make sure
that you feel toasty and warm, okay?

19:40.180 --> 19:43.468
(coughing within)

19:49.189 --> 19:50.895
Okay. It's okay.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.478
It's okay.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.142
It's all right. Go on.

20:11.169 --> 20:14.332
Thanks for being in there.

20:14.506 --> 20:15.837
I know you don't have to be.

20:16.007 --> 20:19.249
It means a lot you being
in there with Judith.

20:19.427 --> 20:22.089
Things okay out there?

20:23.515 --> 20:26.382
Glenn has it.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.185
Maggie.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.098
We don't get to be upset.

20:35.777 --> 20:38.689
We all got jobs to do.
That's what Daddy always says.

20:38.863 --> 20:42.071
Daryl and Michonne
will get the meds.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.575
You and Carol and Rick
will help everyone till they get back.

20:48.248 --> 20:50.409
And I'll take care of Judith.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.074
Just focus on what you have to do.

20:55.547 --> 20:58.334
No matter what happens,
we'll deal with it.

20:59.342 --> 21:02.049
We have to.

21:15.692 --> 21:17.774
When did your dad give it back?

21:19.404 --> 21:21.019
Yesterday.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.188
After everything happened.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.238
You've grown a lot
these last few months.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.576
There's a responsibility about you.

21:33.084 --> 21:37.248
I think it's done you good
to step back.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.413
Yeah.

21:39.591 --> 21:41.582
It was all right.

21:41.759 --> 21:43.010
Can't be like that all the time.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.261
I would have been fine on my own.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.927
lt's peaceful out here.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.639
These last couple days,

21:53.813 --> 21:57.271
we might be safer outside
those walls than in.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.482
No, we're not.

22:25.303 --> 22:28.591
(growling)

22:31.643 --> 22:33.554
( snarls )

22:47.325 --> 22:48.861
Let's wrap this up.

22:49.035 --> 22:52.527
( rattling )

23:04.467 --> 23:08.335
Don't.
You don't need to.

23:17.188 --> 23:19.304
It was so peaceful.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.143
It was.

23:22.527 --> 23:25.189
Can't be like that all the time.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.858
( growls )

23:37.166 --> 23:39.031
It's not as bad as it looks.

23:39.210 --> 23:42.122
( panting heavily )

23:42.297 --> 23:44.458
Don't do that.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.294
(sobbing )
Okay.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.595
I must be a sight to see.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.384
I'm so sorry.

23:54.892 --> 23:56.883
- I heard about Karen--
- Don't.

23:57.061 --> 23:58.312
Don't think about that now.

23:58.479 --> 24:01.971
Think about getting better.
Positive thoughts.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.232
Positive vibes.

24:05.903 --> 24:09.566
I don't know.
(sobbing )

24:10.575 --> 24:12.361
Daryl's got a group going out.

24:12.535 --> 24:14.446
They're getting medicine.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.577
Someplace Hershel knew about.

24:16.748 --> 24:19.330
That veterinary college?

24:20.835 --> 24:23.292
- It's far.
- But they feel sure about it.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.707
So we could have medicine
as early as tomorrow.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.592
We've got a chance.

24:38.561 --> 24:41.348
- Ty.
- Get some rest.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.353
I got to go.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.939
Everything look all right?

24:49.113 --> 24:50.944
Yeah.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.026
Zack kept this thing
running pretty good.

24:55.453 --> 24:57.489
This is Zack's car?

24:57.664 --> 24:59.905
Yeah, fastest one we got.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.159
You all right?

25:05.213 --> 25:08.296
You really want me coming along?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.297
What's that word?

25:14.472 --> 25:15.678
"Zanamivir."

25:15.848 --> 25:17.759
Yup, we need you.

25:20.478 --> 25:23.345
- What's up?
- Still got room for one more?

25:23.523 --> 25:25.309
- Hell, yeah.
- Good.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.474
Just got to get my gear.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.150
All right.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.322
(thumps)

26:00.351 --> 26:02.307
( gasps )
Oh, God, I didn't see you there.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.855
- Sorry to interrupt.
- It's okay.

26:05.022 --> 26:07.013
You okay?

26:07.191 --> 26:10.183
I'm going on the run with Daryl.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.693
But I was wondering--

26:12.864 --> 26:14.900
I know there's a lot
of people in trouble.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.065
Sick.

26:17.243 --> 26:20.656
It's just I know how you are.

26:20.830 --> 26:22.912
You care.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.947
Thank you.

26:25.126 --> 26:28.618
l was wondering if you could
look in on Sasha for me.

26:30.298 --> 26:32.710
It would make me feel better
knowing you were looking in on her.

26:32.884 --> 26:36.342
- If you can't--
- No.

26:36.512 --> 26:38.673
No, I'd be happy to.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.055
Thank you.

26:41.225 --> 26:45.935
Oh, what happened to Karen,
I'm so sorry.

27:01.329 --> 27:03.320
(thumps)

27:11.339 --> 27:13.455
(sobs)

27:35.905 --> 27:38.317
Why aren't you in quarantine?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.405
I'm no good to anyone in there.

27:47.583 --> 27:49.164
Daddy, please.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.951
Maggie, dear,
there are people in there suffering.

27:52.129 --> 27:55.041
I can bring their fever down
and keep them stable.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.831
Daryl's getting the antibiotics.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.840
Some of these people
won't last 12 hours.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.627
I can't let you do this.

28:01.806 --> 28:04.513
Maggie, Glenn's in there.

28:04.684 --> 28:07.801
What's going on?

28:07.979 --> 28:09.935
Elderberries.

28:10.106 --> 28:12.097
My wife used to make tea with them.

28:12.275 --> 28:13.981
They're a natural flu remedy.

28:14.151 --> 28:17.314
Caleb's too sick to help. I can.

28:17.488 --> 28:19.979
There's so many times

28:20.157 --> 28:23.570
we haven't been able to do anything
to change what was happening--

28:23.744 --> 28:25.359
what was happening to us.

28:25.538 --> 28:28.655
We wished we could,
but we couldn't.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.825
This time, I can.
I know I can.

28:32.003 --> 28:33.959
So I have to.

28:34.130 --> 28:36.667
Hershel, if you go in there,
you're gonna get sick.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.457
Wait, we don't know that.
What we do know

28:39.635 --> 28:42.126
is that these people's symptoms
need to be controlled.

28:42.305 --> 28:43.886
Hershel, please.
We can wait.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.047
Listen, damn it!

28:46.225 --> 28:48.887
You step outside,
you risk your life.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.098
You take a drink of water,
you risk your life.

28:52.273 --> 28:56.266
And nowadays you breathe,
and you risk your life.

28:56.444 --> 29:00.028
Every moment now
you don't have a choice.

29:00.197 --> 29:04.406
The only thing you can choose
is what you're risking it for.

29:04.577 --> 29:07.410
Now I can make these people feel better

29:07.580 --> 29:09.866
and hang on a little bit longer.

29:10.041 --> 29:12.623
I can save lives.

29:12.793 --> 29:15.830
That's reason enough to risk mine.

29:17.048 --> 29:19.380
And you know that.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.178
Dad.

29:36.651 --> 29:38.892
( creaking )

29:43.407 --> 29:45.068
( creaking )

29:50.081 --> 29:51.696
Maggie?

29:53.668 --> 29:56.250
Daddy's gone.
He left.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.036
I know.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.214
Did he tell you where he went?

30:02.385 --> 30:05.752
No, but... I know.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.763
How?

30:08.933 --> 30:11.424
Dr. S. is sick and...

30:17.108 --> 30:19.064
...we all gotjobs to do.

30:21.445 --> 30:23.936
We'll deal with it, right?

30:27.618 --> 30:30.655
We don't get to get upset.

31:31.182 --> 31:33.093
(growling)

31:33.267 --> 31:35.849
( metal rattling )

31:54.997 --> 31:57.909
(walkers snarling )

32:17.269 --> 32:19.100
(banging)

32:29.031 --> 32:30.271
Damn it.

32:44.839 --> 32:45.919
Shit.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.081
Carol! Run!

32:53.347 --> 32:54.462
Shit.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.726
Run!

33:11.157 --> 33:12.738
( splashes )

33:25.171 --> 33:27.207
(gunshot)

33:40.269 --> 33:42.430
Piece of cake.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.391
We decided to do that tomorrow.

33:44.565 --> 33:47.352
We don't know if we get a tomorrow.

34:01.540 --> 34:04.031
Daryl:
Hey, I know you weren't running off.

34:04.210 --> 34:08.169
The thing is,
that trail went cold.

34:09.173 --> 34:11.084
You know that, right?

34:15.054 --> 34:16.919
If it was any different,

34:17.097 --> 34:19.053
I'd be right out there with you.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.515
( radio static crackles )

34:32.655 --> 34:34.896
Would you hand me one
of them CDs right there?

34:37.117 --> 34:39.369
Faint voice:
...find sanctuary.

34:39.536 --> 34:41.197
- Was that a voice?
- Shh.

34:41.372 --> 34:44.535
...determined to survive...

34:46.669 --> 34:48.705
...Keep alive.

34:52.508 --> 34:54.749
(tires squeal )

35:27.293 --> 35:30.080
(growling)

35:30.254 --> 35:33.087
- Grab something!
- ( wheels screeching )

35:41.223 --> 35:42.588
Go to the left.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.927
We're jammed up.

35:48.105 --> 35:50.096
Make a run for the gaps right there.

35:50.274 --> 35:53.266
You two make a run for the woods
and don't stop for nothing, you hear me?

35:53.444 --> 35:54.650
Now!

35:59.283 --> 36:00.272
Move!

36:27.770 --> 36:29.601
Ty!

36:36.028 --> 36:37.984
Ty!

36:47.164 --> 36:49.246
Go! Come on!

36:49.416 --> 36:51.156
Come on and get me!

37:01.804 --> 37:03.294
Go! Go!

37:05.599 --> 37:06.679
Come on.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.057
Come on and get me!

37:25.744 --> 37:27.985
Daryl:
Go!

37:36.547 --> 37:38.538
Daryl:
Come on.

37:40.592 --> 37:42.503
Hold up.

37:53.564 --> 37:55.976
(growling)

38:09.580 --> 38:10.695
Come on.

38:22.426 --> 38:24.542
(distant coughing)

38:25.679 --> 38:27.715
Drink it.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.766
Hang in there, Doc.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.773
You shouldn't be here.

38:43.947 --> 38:45.562
Tell me you wouldn't be.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.197
(coughing)

38:48.952 --> 38:50.943
( cup clatters )

38:52.789 --> 38:55.747
(coughs)

39:22.861 --> 39:26.024
If you weren't in here already,

39:26.198 --> 39:28.564
you'd be in here.

39:36.833 --> 39:39.370
(coughs)

39:41.755 --> 39:44.121
I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.378
( groans )

39:53.976 --> 39:55.807
Keep this on your forehead.

39:55.978 --> 39:58.185
Veterinarian's orders.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.355
(sighs)

40:02.526 --> 40:04.733
This sucks.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.729
After everything,

40:08.907 --> 40:11.774
we just get taken out
by a glorified cold.

40:11.952 --> 40:14.694
Don't say things like that.

40:14.871 --> 40:17.533
Don't even think things like that.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.203
All I can do is stop saying them.

40:21.378 --> 40:23.414
No, you can do more.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.796
We got this far somehow,

40:25.966 --> 40:28.332
you can believe somehow.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.593
Now we all have jobs here.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.970
That one's yours.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.696
That was a stupid thing you did.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.906
Going out there like that.

41:02.336 --> 41:04.543
Yes, it was.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.013
You know, you do a lot for us,

41:17.184 --> 41:19.300
for the kids.

41:22.564 --> 41:24.555
You sacrifice a lot.

41:30.238 --> 41:33.366
Is there anything you wouldn't do
for the people here?

41:36.453 --> 41:38.739
No.

41:43.377 --> 41:45.413
Carol...?

41:52.969 --> 41:55.836
Did you kill Karen and David?

41:59.309 --> 42:01.470
Yes.
