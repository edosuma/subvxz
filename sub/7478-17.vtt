WEBVTT

00:19.643 --> 00:20.758
Yeah!

00:27.818 --> 00:29.075
No, I got you. I got you.

00:29.099 --> 00:30.737
- No worries.
- All right.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.305
Alvie, we're good.

00:39.329 --> 00:40.932
All bets are in.

00:40.956 --> 00:43.009
- Let's go!
- Okay.

00:43.033 --> 00:45.308
Orange car.
Come up. Come up. Come up.

00:45.332 --> 00:46.760
That's good.

00:46.784 --> 00:49.062
Silver car. Come up. Come up.

00:49.086 --> 00:51.226
You're good.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.465
Let's go. Let's go, baby. Let's go.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.563
Let's go, baby. Let's go.

01:08.151 --> 01:09.314
Come on.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.251
Let's get out of here!

02:00.998 --> 02:04.093
- Start taking the freeway.
- I like taking the streets.

02:04.117 --> 02:07.139
No, you like being late. The freeway
would have gotten us here faster.

02:07.163 --> 02:09.223
Oh, that parking lot they call the 10?

02:09.247 --> 02:11.190
It's also known
as the Santa Monica Freeway.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.391
They have names
as well as numbers.

02:12.415 --> 02:14.396
Mm-hm. Olympic's faster.

02:14.420 --> 02:17.240
You never take Olympic
before noon going west.

02:17.264 --> 02:18.605
What if it's a leap year?

02:18.629 --> 02:21.950
Sam here claims to know the name
of every freeway in California.

02:21.974 --> 02:24.658
- Oh, yeah? What about the 8?
- Ocean Beach Freeway.

02:24.682 --> 02:26.824
- The 2?
- Glendale Freeway.

02:26.848 --> 02:27.891
215?

02:29.569 --> 02:33.020
- Got him.
- Escondido Freeway. Bam!

02:37.327 --> 02:39.734
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

02:40.121 --> 02:41.295
Nice geek chariot.

02:41.319 --> 02:42.754
Mock away, bipeds,

02:42.778 --> 02:45.425
but I've managed to shave 43 minutes
of walking time

02:45.449 --> 02:47.263
that I can now apply to my work.

02:47.287 --> 02:48.683
Forty three minutes?

02:48.707 --> 02:50.540
- Bet he took the streets.
- Yeah, right.

02:52.509 --> 02:55.712
I'm a firm believer that what
you drive reflects who you are.

02:57.097 --> 02:58.567
- Exactly.
- Whatever.

02:58.591 --> 03:01.007
The way you drive.

03:01.268 --> 03:03.284
Naval Yeoman James Rush,

03:03.308 --> 03:05.661
home on leave
from San Diego Naval Base,

03:05.685 --> 03:07.659
died in an illegal street race

03:07.683 --> 03:10.752
in a stadium parking lot
early this morning.

03:10.776 --> 03:13.542
In our culture, some consider it
a rite of passage.

03:13.566 --> 03:15.957
Boys will be boys.

03:15.981 --> 03:17.439
Ouch!

03:18.995 --> 03:21.402
What was Rush's classification?

03:22.040 --> 03:23.178
Well, according to his file,

03:23.202 --> 03:26.102
he was working Admin Support
for the quartermaster's office.

03:26.126 --> 03:29.721
What's weird is Yeoman Rush's file
is heavily encrypted.

03:29.745 --> 03:31.891
What Admin division is encrypted?

03:31.915 --> 03:33.965
The ones used
to cover something confidential.

03:34.678 --> 03:36.611
Eric, find out
what he was really working on.

03:36.635 --> 03:38.820
Well, could just be
an unfortunate mishap.

03:38.844 --> 03:39.844
Maybe.

03:41.601 --> 03:43.237
But that encrypted personnel file
suggests

03:43.261 --> 03:45.346
he was working somewhere
classified.

03:46.523 --> 03:48.741
The other driver kept going.

03:48.765 --> 03:50.828
Never even tapped the brake.

03:50.852 --> 03:54.278
- You think he was running?
- Tinted windows, no plates, no ID.

03:56.909 --> 03:58.842
"TokkanOne"?

03:58.866 --> 04:02.761
Tokkan, it's Japanese.
It means a lightning bolt.

04:02.785 --> 04:05.222
We need to find the other driver.

04:05.246 --> 04:06.746
Let's check out the crash site.

04:07.128 --> 04:08.290
Take Kensi.

04:10.298 --> 04:11.305
Yeah, you heard me.

04:11.329 --> 04:13.642
I know you're taking PCH.
I'm not sitting in traffic.

04:13.666 --> 04:16.571
So I'll find out everything I can
about Yeoman Rush.

04:16.595 --> 04:19.027
You two suck exhaust
for the next two hours.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.026
Well, suit yourself.

04:21.050 --> 04:22.744
Come on, Kens.

04:22.768 --> 04:25.070
Hey, what do you say we, uh,
stop for some doughnuts?

04:25.094 --> 04:26.730
I love doughnuts.

04:28.149 --> 04:30.226
You didn't say anything
about doughnuts.

04:30.861 --> 04:35.108
There is nothing sexier
than an empty sea of pavement.

04:35.782 --> 04:37.917
Given the rain, I'll take a hammock,
a sunset,

04:37.941 --> 04:39.422
and a secluded cove somewhere.

04:39.446 --> 04:43.036
You kidding me? You know what the
sand would do to your brake drums?

04:43.540 --> 04:44.548
What?

04:44.572 --> 04:48.997
Some people find nothing hotter than
a racing engine and squealing tyres.

04:49.338 --> 04:50.898
Yeah, if you're dating
the Michelin Man.

04:52.049 --> 04:54.730
How are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

04:54.754 --> 04:56.184
Depends. Who are you?

04:56.208 --> 04:58.521
NCIS. Who are you?

04:58.545 --> 05:00.691
Allison Pritchett. Raydex Insurance.

05:00.715 --> 05:03.074
I've been assigned to this claim.

05:03.098 --> 05:05.202
What can you tell me
about what happened here?

05:05.226 --> 05:06.451
Nothing yet.

05:06.475 --> 05:08.118
Street racing's a growing problem.

05:08.142 --> 05:11.993
These kids spend more than
the car's worth making them go faster.

05:12.017 --> 05:13.998
And for what?

05:14.022 --> 05:17.815
Same reason people spend a mortgage
payment on their purse, I guess.

05:18.243 --> 05:20.674
I'd appreciate a copy
of the report when it's done.

05:20.698 --> 05:22.092
Don't you file your own?

05:22.116 --> 05:26.156
We like to be thorough
and professional.

05:31.298 --> 05:33.646
- What was that?
- I know, right?

05:33.670 --> 05:35.751
I mean you.

05:36.053 --> 05:37.053
Me?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.633
She was acting weird, Callen.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.298
I don't trust her.

05:43.686 --> 05:45.951
I'm gonna go talk to L.A.P.D.
About giving us the wreck.

05:45.975 --> 05:47.771
You breathe a little bit.

05:49.984 --> 05:52.060
You're really funny.

05:54.238 --> 05:56.456
There and back in just over an hour
on the PCH.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.914
Booyah!

05:57.938 --> 06:01.628
Ah! You got lucky.
Where's my doughnut?

06:01.652 --> 06:03.573
I thought you were watching
your figure.

06:04.457 --> 06:07.387
- Okay.
- Oh, Mr. Callen.

06:07.411 --> 06:11.345
It seems you've been spotted again
in a bit of a rush.

06:11.369 --> 06:13.873
Ooh, red light camera.

06:14.509 --> 06:16.466
Busted.

06:17.429 --> 06:18.757
I was chasing a suspect.

06:20.682 --> 06:22.734
Nope. That was our day off.

06:22.758 --> 06:25.199
You were late picking me up
for the Kings game.

06:25.223 --> 06:27.281
No doughnut, no love.

06:27.305 --> 06:30.292
Maybe our buddy Bernhart from
L.A.P.D. Can help you out with that.

06:30.316 --> 06:32.453
Oh, he most certainly will not.

06:32.477 --> 06:34.538
- You're gonna jeopardise this cover?
- Heh.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.881
You'll do what everybody else does
and go to traffic school.

06:37.905 --> 06:39.166
- Yeah, heh.
- It's no big deal.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.838
You can do it online. You'll love it.

06:40.862 --> 06:44.547
You can if you haven't had a conviction
in the previous 18 months.

06:44.571 --> 06:48.094
Unfortunately, this is number three
for Mr. Callen,

06:48.118 --> 06:53.062
which means 16 hours
of in-class study.

06:53.086 --> 06:54.396
Hetty, you're joking.

06:54.420 --> 06:57.106
Don't worry. Uh, maybe it'll be fun.

06:57.130 --> 07:01.740
I enrolled you in a comedy traffic
school for the next two days.

07:01.764 --> 07:04.579
You didn't.
Hetty, I'm working on a case.

07:04.603 --> 07:08.494
Sam and Kensi are more than capable
of covering for you

07:08.518 --> 07:10.268
- until you're finished.
- Mm-hm, yeah.

07:11.109 --> 07:16.162
It starts in one half hour in Culver City,
so you best be on your way.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.914
We don't want you breaking
the speed limit to get there.

07:18.938 --> 07:21.300
You might wanna take the 90.
Just saying.

07:21.324 --> 07:23.571
Which is the Marina Freeway.

07:25.207 --> 07:26.666
Booyah.

07:29.587 --> 07:31.140
What do you got, Eric?

07:31.164 --> 07:34.019
A lot of people posted videos
and photos of last night's action

07:34.043 --> 07:35.224
on their social websites.

07:35.248 --> 07:38.178
I'm just comparing the best of them.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.678
All right, a quick snap.

07:43.893 --> 07:44.948
Photo on the left.

07:44.972 --> 07:50.411
Okay.
Shake, rattle and we are rolling.

07:50.435 --> 07:53.075
Photosynth has stitched together
all these random photos

07:53.099 --> 07:54.285
from different sources

07:54.309 --> 07:57.583
and created one big
interactive 3-D image.

07:57.607 --> 07:59.881
We have a close-up
of the explosion?

07:59.905 --> 08:02.650
Ask and you shall receive.

08:03.205 --> 08:05.090
I pulled some audio
from a video cam.

08:05.114 --> 08:08.469
You can actually hear Rush activate
his pressurised NOS,

08:08.493 --> 08:11.100
but there's no blinding acceleration.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.728
- Just a blinding flash.
- Right.

08:13.752 --> 08:16.545
Which suggests the nitrous
never made it into the system.

08:17.094 --> 08:19.905
Rush ran a wet system
which mixes nitrous...

08:19.929 --> 08:22.090
Nitrous and fuel into the intake.
Right.

08:23.225 --> 08:26.155
Right, but when the system didn't
get what it was expecting...

08:26.179 --> 08:29.366
Engine pressure built, temp spiked,
blew the engine.

08:29.390 --> 08:30.704
Lady knows her stuff.

08:30.728 --> 08:33.082
The lady also knows
that a blown engine

08:33.106 --> 08:35.068
doesn't create this type of damage.

08:35.530 --> 08:38.078
To the naked eye, it looks like
the Mitsubishi explodes

08:38.102 --> 08:39.421
right after the Honda passes.

08:39.445 --> 08:42.534
But if we slow it down,

08:43.496 --> 08:46.746
it's actually a chain reaction
of two separate explosions.

08:47.125 --> 08:49.343
The first explosion is consistent
with a blown engine

08:49.367 --> 08:51.180
resulting in a mild flare-up.

08:51.204 --> 08:53.728
What caused the second explosion?

08:53.752 --> 08:55.145
Rush was a master mechanic.

08:55.169 --> 08:58.235
He wouldn't have made a mistake
fitting that fuel system.

08:58.259 --> 09:01.382
So are you saying that Rush's car
was sabotaged?

09:03.684 --> 09:07.219
Encrypted files, possible sabotage.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.434
I'm thinking this just became
a murder investigation.

09:33.738 --> 09:36.942
Good afternoon. I'm Mr. Loobertz.

09:37.409 --> 09:42.403
Welcome to
the Fun For All Traffic School.

09:45.083 --> 09:48.310
Now, I know some of you

09:48.334 --> 09:52.524
probably aren't real excited
to be here,

09:52.548 --> 09:55.468
but I guarantee you,
it's gonna be a great day.

09:55.803 --> 10:00.820
Because not only are we fun for all,
we're all for fun.

10:00.844 --> 10:05.975
We put the cool in school,
don't you know.

10:07.356 --> 10:08.767
Wouldn't that be "chool"?

10:09.317 --> 10:10.727
The "H" is silent.

10:12.945 --> 10:15.437
- Yeah.
- I'm in hell.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.965
Now, the garage is a family business.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.932
Older brother Keith,
younger sister Angela.

10:24.956 --> 10:28.102
Financial records show they're
one oil change away from foreclosure.

10:28.126 --> 10:29.729
A link on Rush's Facebook page

10:29.753 --> 10:33.586
redirects to a site dedicated
to his racing victories.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.277
Heh. Looks like Yeoman Rush
was a living legend.

10:37.301 --> 10:41.089
Yup. Now just a legend.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.287
What are we supposed to do?

10:49.311 --> 10:50.740
What am I supposed to do?

10:50.764 --> 10:52.746
You don't understand.
We don't have the money.

10:52.770 --> 10:54.664
- We gotta let him go.
- It's not right.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.879
What do you want?
We don't have a choice.

10:56.903 --> 10:59.755
Guys, guys, guys.
Don't worry about it.

10:59.779 --> 11:01.672
It's okay. All right?

11:01.696 --> 11:03.662
I'll be all right.

11:05.333 --> 11:06.554
Good luck.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.660
- I'm sorry, we're closed.
- No, we're not.

11:09.545 --> 11:10.980
What can I do for you guys?

11:11.004 --> 11:13.722
- Keith and Angela Rush?
- Yeah, why?

11:13.746 --> 11:17.045
NCIS. We're here to talk about
your brother James.

11:19.973 --> 11:21.692
James was an angel.

11:21.716 --> 11:24.537
I remember on my 11th birthday,
I wanted a new bike,

11:24.561 --> 11:26.032
but my dad couldn't afford it.

11:26.056 --> 11:28.851
So, James built me one from scrap.

11:29.691 --> 11:30.865
He could build anything.

11:30.889 --> 11:32.645
Sounds like a great brother.

11:33.529 --> 11:35.272
The best.

11:35.531 --> 11:38.543
No matter how bad the situation,
he was able to see the good in it.

11:38.567 --> 11:42.716
Even with this garage,
he somehow made it all worth it.

11:42.740 --> 11:45.559
Now that he's gone,
we should just sell it and move on.

11:45.583 --> 11:48.845
- That bad?
- We're barely staying afloat.

11:48.869 --> 11:52.769
My mom's gone, my father's in jail.

11:52.793 --> 11:57.354
James dies last night and Keith is
still acting as if it's business as usual.

11:57.378 --> 12:00.365
- This garage, street racing, it's cursed.
- Rough here lately.

12:00.389 --> 12:02.525
Sounds like your sister's
had enough.

12:02.549 --> 12:05.786
Well, this garage has been
family-owned for 15 years.

12:05.810 --> 12:07.330
- I mean, it's all we have.
- Hmm.

12:07.354 --> 12:09.372
If we sell it now, we'll have nothing.

12:09.396 --> 12:11.997
Angela doesn't see that
and I'm not ready to tap out yet.

12:12.021 --> 12:15.111
Sometimes you gotta stand
and fight for what you love.

12:15.947 --> 12:19.624
I've taken care of James and Angela
since my dad got locked up.

12:19.648 --> 12:22.993
You know, it hasn't always been great,
but we survived.

12:24.915 --> 12:27.216
Best thing I ever did was get James
to enlist in the Navy.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.706
Keep him from winding up like Dad.

12:30.337 --> 12:31.796
But he couldn't stay away.

12:32.298 --> 12:33.756
So, what happened with your father?

12:35.009 --> 12:38.235
He's six years into a dime
for vehicular manslaughter.

12:38.259 --> 12:39.568
During a race.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.020
So you disapprove?

12:41.044 --> 12:43.382
Hell, no. I used to race too.

12:44.018 --> 12:45.181
Why'd you give it up?

12:46.145 --> 12:48.636
I was planning on going pro,

12:49.649 --> 12:52.187
but one thing led to another
and here we are.

12:52.694 --> 12:55.125
You know, I'm fighting
to keep this garage alive for Angela,

12:55.149 --> 12:57.397
whether she sees it or not,
you know?

12:57.740 --> 13:01.074
I'm not gonna let my brother's murder
force me into selling.

13:01.619 --> 13:04.111
What makes you think
your brother was murdered?

13:04.331 --> 13:06.430
The guy who was dragging,
silver Honda?

13:06.454 --> 13:07.632
What about it?

13:07.656 --> 13:09.435
Tokkan.

13:09.459 --> 13:11.513
He's been gunning for James
for years.

13:11.537 --> 13:12.970
When James enlisted,

13:12.994 --> 13:14.940
- Tokkan became the guy to beat.
- Hmm.

13:14.964 --> 13:17.755
James returns, Tokkan's back
to being second best.

13:18.554 --> 13:20.273
Where can we find this guy,
Tokkan?

13:20.297 --> 13:21.942
Nobody knows who he is.

13:21.966 --> 13:25.225
He never shows his face.
Never sticks around after he wins.

13:26.145 --> 13:28.113
The guy's a mystery.

13:28.137 --> 13:31.623
Need to see your surveillance tapes,
see if anybody got to your brother's car.

13:31.647 --> 13:34.284
James wouldn't even let me
near his car.

13:34.308 --> 13:36.693
Sibling rivalry?

13:38.282 --> 13:40.690
Seems stupid now, right?

13:41.160 --> 13:42.215
Gotta admire their spirit.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.713
One tragedy after another
and they just keep moving on.

13:44.737 --> 13:48.010
You have to.
Otherwise it eats you alive.

13:48.034 --> 13:49.596
She's funny. Crazy.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.392
- Who?
- Hetty sent me a text.

13:52.416 --> 13:53.763
Hetty doesn't text.

13:53.787 --> 13:56.515
She may not hit you.
She hits me all the time.

13:56.539 --> 13:57.725
About what?

13:57.749 --> 13:59.398
Dirty jokes, mostly. In Latin.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.280
Should hear the one about
e pluribus unum.

14:01.304 --> 14:03.964
We're practically BFFs.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.204
BTW, on your left.

14:10.228 --> 14:14.123
This is exactly why Hetty took away
your pogo stick and your unicycle.

14:14.147 --> 14:17.523
Do you actually have something for us,
Ericus Annoyingus?

14:19.199 --> 14:20.908
I ran a check on Tokkan.

14:22.108 --> 14:24.967
The name is well-known
in the world of street racing,

14:24.991 --> 14:27.975
but the guy has never been
caught or arrested.

14:27.999 --> 14:32.223
Then we've got Ratchetheads
mechanic, Omar Alvarez,

14:32.247 --> 14:33.726
who's just been fired.

14:33.750 --> 14:36.271
He's not a street racer,
but he's got a criminal record

14:36.295 --> 14:39.113
for his involvement
in a chop shop in Inglewood.

14:39.137 --> 14:41.771
Get us a list of his known
associates and family members

14:41.795 --> 14:44.155
and any guys
he may have done time with.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.948
Rush senior's in prison
for killing someone in a street race.

14:46.972 --> 14:49.493
Maybe his son's murder
was some sort of payback.

14:49.517 --> 14:51.100
Need that file, too, Eric.

14:51.566 --> 14:53.998
Been there, done that.
Check your e-mail.

14:54.022 --> 14:56.899
I told you this thing's making me
more efficient. Tsk, tsk.

14:57.614 --> 15:01.173
They dropped off Rush's Mitsubishi
at the impound lot, or what's left of it.

15:01.197 --> 15:02.886
- You wanna work it?
- No, go ahead.

15:02.910 --> 15:05.343
I'll send Callen an e-mail,
make sure he's up to speed.

15:05.367 --> 15:06.678
Think he's having fun?

15:06.702 --> 15:09.222
Heh, oh, yeah.

15:09.246 --> 15:12.977
Now, as you can see,
the California Driver's Handbook

15:13.001 --> 15:14.476
is well over 90 pages.

15:14.500 --> 15:18.232
That's a lot of information
for anyone to remember.

15:18.256 --> 15:20.467
You know what isn't hard
to remember?

15:21.180 --> 15:22.615
Anyone?

15:22.639 --> 15:25.108
Anyone at all? That's a question.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.768
Need a hint?

15:28.104 --> 15:29.360
All right.

15:29.384 --> 15:31.853
That's right. That's right.
There you go.

15:33.860 --> 15:36.042
Go, music. Go, lyrics.

15:36.066 --> 15:38.669
Yeah, can you feel it? Fun For AII.

15:38.693 --> 15:42.210
Yeah, Fun For All has broken
each section down into songs,

15:42.234 --> 15:46.954
from rocking registration riffs
to insurance requirement raps.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.181
Yeah. So there's something here
for everybody.

15:51.205 --> 15:53.667
Someone shoot me, please.

15:54.172 --> 15:55.964
Give me a wrench.

15:58.635 --> 16:00.485
Whoa, careful there, cowboy.

16:00.509 --> 16:02.280
This baby's suffered enough.

16:02.304 --> 16:04.026
Sorry, I didn't know
you cared so much.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.446
Well, what can I say?

16:05.470 --> 16:07.719
Grease is my favourite perfume.

16:08.979 --> 16:11.162
So tell me.

16:11.186 --> 16:12.744
How do you know so much
about cars?

16:12.768 --> 16:15.148
Used to help my dad tune his Nova
on the weekends.

16:15.695 --> 16:19.503
In fact, ugh, I used to spend my
afternoons handing him tools

16:19.527 --> 16:21.086
and bringing him cold beers.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.965
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah.

16:23.989 --> 16:26.807
Every time he turned away,
I'd adjust the carburettor on my own,

16:26.831 --> 16:29.536
just so he could act surprised
when he came back.

16:31.127 --> 16:33.701
This is not gonna work.
Half-inch socket.

16:42.806 --> 16:44.431
Seriously?

16:45.392 --> 16:47.111
My dad and I
never really worked on cars.

16:47.135 --> 16:49.030
He was more of a Lego guy.

16:49.054 --> 16:50.889
Hold on.

16:51.940 --> 16:53.351
Oh, I feel something.

17:01.826 --> 17:03.462
Oh, my God.

17:03.486 --> 17:06.210
- What is it?
- I don't know.

17:06.233 --> 17:09.095
But I'm betting it's not supposed
to be in this car.

17:09.118 --> 17:10.952
Maybe Keith Rush
can tell us what it is.

17:26.935 --> 17:28.180
Looks like no one's home.

17:29.604 --> 17:31.348
No one friendly.

17:37.154 --> 17:39.028
I'll take the back.

17:51.710 --> 17:53.537
Stop. Federal agent.

17:57.466 --> 17:59.020
It's kind of late for an oil change.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.401
You mind telling us
what you're doing here?

18:01.425 --> 18:04.241
I'm Commander Garrison Timmons.

18:04.265 --> 18:07.468
James Rush's commanding officer.

18:18.003 --> 18:19.093
James was a good kid.

18:19.117 --> 18:21.229
I was trying to pay my respects
to the family.

18:21.253 --> 18:22.478
Yeah, okay.

18:22.502 --> 18:26.589
I wanna know exactly what this is
and how it works.

18:29.056 --> 18:30.301
Could not tell you.

18:31.308 --> 18:33.953
You dropped it in the garage
when you ran away.

18:33.977 --> 18:37.536
I'm sure there's all kinds
of fancy equipment inside there.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.107
It's a garage.

18:39.441 --> 18:42.205
All that other fancy equipment doesn't
have your prints all over it.

18:42.229 --> 18:43.862
That does.

18:44.488 --> 18:46.148
Excuse me.

18:55.583 --> 18:56.958
Hey, whoa. What are you doing?

18:57.335 --> 18:58.794
Give him what he came for.

19:09.055 --> 19:10.336
How about this?

19:10.807 --> 19:12.859
You wouldn't know what this is,
would you?

19:12.883 --> 19:15.515
As a matter of fact, yes.

19:16.688 --> 19:17.851
Where is the other one?

19:21.234 --> 19:25.043
James was working on an advanced
lithium-ion battery system.

19:25.067 --> 19:29.948
Ultra-lightweight, high-powered,
never needs to be replaced.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.654
Unstable, but if perfected,
worth billions.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.562
Two of the units went missing.

19:39.586 --> 19:41.307
When I heard about the crash,
I got worried.

19:41.331 --> 19:42.513
Why?

19:42.537 --> 19:43.854
James was the kind of R & D guy

19:43.878 --> 19:45.710
who liked to get his hands dirty.

19:46.260 --> 19:49.321
It wasn't unusual for him
to test stuff out on his own.

19:49.345 --> 19:51.032
The battery system.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.651
It dramatically increases efficiency
in the combustion cycle.

19:54.675 --> 19:57.522
In effect, it would have made the car
go quicker, okay?

19:58.648 --> 20:01.874
I didn't want the Navy to discover
they were missing.

20:01.898 --> 20:03.871
I've come to retrieve them.

20:03.895 --> 20:05.541
And this?

20:05.565 --> 20:06.937
It's a dosimeter.

20:07.741 --> 20:10.825
It picks up
the battery's lithium-ion signature.

20:17.960 --> 20:20.795
This technology isn't
just worth a fortune.

20:21.630 --> 20:25.438
It would revolutionise
our attack vehicles in the field.

20:25.462 --> 20:29.478
It's something we can't afford
to have fall into the wrong hands.

20:29.502 --> 20:32.361
Well, well, well.
If it isn't our resident scofflaw.

20:32.385 --> 20:34.693
Hope you had a nice day off.

20:34.717 --> 20:36.933
Don't even start.

20:38.481 --> 20:40.782
If someone did sabotage
Yeoman Rush's car,

20:40.806 --> 20:42.122
what was the motive?

20:42.146 --> 20:43.753
Could be a rival street racer.

20:43.777 --> 20:46.791
Which puts this TokkanOne character
at the top of our list.

20:46.815 --> 20:48.626
What about Rush's CO?

20:48.650 --> 20:50.864
He came clean too quick.
I think he's legit.

20:52.037 --> 20:53.555
The missing hi-tech battery?

20:53.579 --> 20:55.466
On our way to search the garage.

20:55.490 --> 20:57.052
Good morning.

20:57.076 --> 20:58.851
How long does it take a car

20:58.875 --> 21:03.765
travelling at 35 miles per hour
to stop, Mr. Callen?

21:03.789 --> 21:05.484
Two hundred feet.

21:05.508 --> 21:07.752
Hmm, try 210.

21:09.638 --> 21:11.108
How can someone so small be so...?

21:11.132 --> 21:13.595
It's just traffic school.
How bad can it be?

21:14.268 --> 21:16.283
Remember the Libyans
that took us off the trawler?

21:16.307 --> 21:18.827
- Really?
- The Libyans didn't sing.

21:18.851 --> 21:20.731
- There's singing?
- And puppets.

21:22.109 --> 21:23.461
I'm sorry.

21:23.485 --> 21:26.499
Oh, good morning, Speed Racer.

21:26.523 --> 21:28.132
Did you get my last text?

21:28.156 --> 21:30.613
OMG, Hetty. Hilarious.

21:32.286 --> 21:33.922
Hope you're watching the time.

21:33.946 --> 21:36.410
Uh, last day and all.

21:36.833 --> 21:40.747
Remember, hands at 9 and 3.

21:42.172 --> 21:43.714
Ten and 2.

21:46.259 --> 21:48.335
Hang in there, buddy.

21:51.097 --> 21:53.565
- It's a battery.
- I've never seen this before.

21:53.589 --> 21:55.652
Keith would know more
about this sort of thing.

21:55.676 --> 21:57.644
You can ask him
when he gets back.

21:59.356 --> 22:01.313
- Mind if I take a look around?
- No.

22:03.735 --> 22:05.894
You know where
we can find Omar Alvarez?

22:06.238 --> 22:09.607
Uh, South Central, always moving.

22:10.910 --> 22:13.614
This must be a lot for you guys
to handle on your own.

22:14.079 --> 22:15.466
I hate street racing.

22:15.490 --> 22:18.595
I begged James to stop,
but he wouldn't listen.

22:18.619 --> 22:19.955
Men are idiots.

22:20.878 --> 22:22.265
Sometimes.

22:22.289 --> 22:25.915
And after what happened to our father,
you'd think he would have...

22:26.384 --> 22:28.816
He just couldn't stop racing.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.589
Nothing here.

22:31.222 --> 22:32.681
Know where we can find Keith?

22:33.933 --> 22:36.068
He said he was making a parts run.

22:36.092 --> 22:37.360
A parts run for what?

22:37.384 --> 22:39.246
It's not like we've gotten
any customers.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.823
- Well, where do you think he went?
- I'm not sure.

22:41.847 --> 22:44.670
I tried calling his cell,
but he didn't answer.

22:44.694 --> 22:46.794
I'm worried he's out there
looking for Tokkan.

22:46.818 --> 22:49.277
And if he finds him...

22:49.908 --> 22:52.173
I can't lose another brother.

22:52.197 --> 22:55.489
Your brother needs to contact us
the moment he gets back.

22:57.082 --> 23:00.641
And so that is why it is essential

23:00.665 --> 23:04.881
that you carry them at all times.

23:05.216 --> 23:07.292
Isn't that right, Mr. Walinski?

23:09.345 --> 23:11.587
Mr. Walinski.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.882
Mr. Walinski!

23:16.561 --> 23:19.597
Essential. I got it.

23:21.482 --> 23:25.077
- So insurance...
- Mandatory, Mr. Walinski.

23:25.101 --> 23:26.997
Mandatory.

23:27.021 --> 23:29.498
What if you modified your car
for street racing?

23:29.522 --> 23:33.673
Anyone familiar with the California
Insurance Reference Manual

23:33.697 --> 23:37.464
knows that street racers
cannot be insured.

23:37.488 --> 23:41.556
As a matter of fact, street racing
or any other negligent act

23:41.580 --> 23:44.303
voids an insurance policy altogether.

23:44.327 --> 23:46.131
Yes, sir.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.675
I hope those are notes,
Mr. Walinski.

23:54.975 --> 23:57.988
Callen was right.
Rush didn't have a policy with Raydex.

23:58.012 --> 24:00.037
In fact, as far as I can tell,

24:00.061 --> 24:02.413
he didn't have a policy
with anyone outside the Navy.

24:02.437 --> 24:04.743
Well, what about the insurance agent
that we met?

24:04.767 --> 24:06.996
Doesn't exist.
Raydex has no one by that name

24:07.020 --> 24:09.081
and didn't have an agent
in the area yesterday.

24:09.105 --> 24:11.132
So, Alvarez's last-known address
was bogus,

24:11.156 --> 24:13.128
but his list of acquaintances
probably isn't.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.335
Who does Alvarez trust?

24:14.359 --> 24:17.763
Was cellmates with a guy for three
years by the name of Dwight Johnson.

24:17.787 --> 24:20.970
Cellmates tend to get close when
locked up if they don't kill each other.

24:20.994 --> 24:23.351
Wait, Johnson has a place
in Echo Park.

24:23.375 --> 24:25.206
What about the case against
James' father?

24:25.632 --> 24:30.021
Uh, let's see. The person Rush senior
killed was homeless and nameless.

24:30.045 --> 24:31.275
Body was never identified.

24:31.299 --> 24:33.357
Making the chances
of this being payback slim.

24:33.381 --> 24:35.775
I got him. I got him.

24:35.799 --> 24:37.695
- Alvarez?
- Tokkan's car.

24:37.719 --> 24:39.863
He just turned off the 105
into El Segundo.

24:39.887 --> 24:43.314
Kensi, separate cars.
Eric, talk us in. Don't lose him.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.214
Where is he, Eric? I don't see him.

24:48.238 --> 24:50.588
He's right in front of you.
Turning into the refinery.

24:50.612 --> 24:52.253
He's accelerating, Sam.

24:52.277 --> 24:54.029
I got him, but we've been made.

25:06.257 --> 25:07.586
I'll try and get ahead of him.

25:49.886 --> 25:52.721
Federal agents. Out of the vehicle.
Hands where I can see them, now.

25:53.347 --> 25:54.379
Now.

26:18.856 --> 26:20.623
"College student,

26:20.647 --> 26:23.936
wealthy family, no record.

26:24.236 --> 26:29.040
Allysia Takada, a.k.a. Insurance agent,
a.k.a. Tokkan."

26:29.064 --> 26:31.791
Basically you're just a spoiled rich kid
from Palos Verdes.

26:31.815 --> 26:34.283
The secret identity was all
part of the game, right?

26:35.998 --> 26:38.287
Except this isn't a game.

26:38.835 --> 26:40.210
A man is dead.

26:42.380 --> 26:44.147
Did the frustration
of losing to James Rush

26:44.171 --> 26:46.547
finally escalate to murder?

26:48.761 --> 26:50.838
You wanted the title.

26:53.099 --> 26:57.263
Top racer on the set.
TokkanOne. Lightning bolt, right?

26:58.522 --> 27:00.574
Except James was faster.

27:00.598 --> 27:03.241
So you or one of your buddies
rigged his car and killed him.

27:03.265 --> 27:04.265
No.

27:05.112 --> 27:08.563
No. James and I were competitive,
but I didn't kill him.

27:11.994 --> 27:13.785
I was in love with him.

27:17.374 --> 27:19.700
I was so happy
when James joined the Navy.

27:21.498 --> 27:23.639
He ever tell you
what he was working on?

27:23.663 --> 27:25.096
Not really.

27:25.120 --> 27:27.351
He liked that it was top-secret stuff.

27:27.375 --> 27:30.979
He told me he had a trick up his sleeve
and challenged me to race him.

27:31.003 --> 27:33.054
Was he the only one
who knew you were Tokkan?

27:33.349 --> 27:35.816
Tokkan was James' idea.

27:35.840 --> 27:38.568
None of the guys
would race a woman.

27:38.592 --> 27:40.147
You know guys and their egos.

27:40.690 --> 27:43.181
If you loved him, why didn't you stop
when he crashed?

27:43.526 --> 27:47.524
Because I knew he couldn't survive
something like that.

27:48.365 --> 27:50.417
I just kept driving around all night.

27:50.441 --> 27:52.610
I didn't wanna face
what had happened.

27:53.912 --> 27:56.403
I didn't go back until the next day.

27:57.666 --> 27:59.136
He have any enemies?

27:59.160 --> 28:02.430
If anyone wanted to make sure
James didn't finish a race,

28:02.454 --> 28:05.523
- it would be Stringer.
- Stringer?

28:05.547 --> 28:08.421
Drives a pearl-black Chevelle.

28:09.094 --> 28:13.306
He lost to James earlier
and was pretty pissed.

28:13.724 --> 28:16.452
There was a lot of bad blood
between them.

28:16.476 --> 28:17.924
He have a first name?

28:18.521 --> 28:21.664
Nick Stringer. Biker, car thief
and all-around badass.

28:21.688 --> 28:23.577
Moves around the country,
city to city.

28:23.601 --> 28:26.326
Stays long enough to show up
on the local law-enforcement radar

28:26.350 --> 28:27.880
before moving on.

28:27.904 --> 28:30.919
When he's not racing,
he's either betting on races

28:30.943 --> 28:32.753
or stealing cars to race.

28:32.777 --> 28:35.716
Warrants read like a Zagat guide
to illegal street racing.

28:35.740 --> 28:37.538
There. Pearl-black Chevelle.

28:38.750 --> 28:39.805
And there's Stringer.

28:39.829 --> 28:43.062
Unfortunately being at a race
isn't enough to charge him.

28:43.086 --> 28:45.247
Who's he talking to?

28:45.590 --> 28:46.753
Eric, step frame.

28:47.467 --> 28:48.962
Now blow it up.

28:49.386 --> 28:50.501
Right there.

28:51.179 --> 28:52.722
The reflection.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.560
Keith Rush?

29:06.320 --> 29:08.752
Two on one, huh? On the ground.

29:08.776 --> 29:11.593
- On the ground.
- No, no. Don't shoot.

29:11.617 --> 29:13.444
There's gasoline everywhere.

29:13.995 --> 29:16.367
Don't do it. Don't be stupid.

29:25.006 --> 29:26.121
Where's Angela?

29:28.051 --> 29:30.399
She said she wouldn't come
to the garage anymore.

29:30.423 --> 29:33.276
Well, she is the one with the brains
in the family, isn't she?

29:33.300 --> 29:36.534
- So who are they?
- They work for a guy named Stringer.

29:36.558 --> 29:38.269
The guy you were with at the race?

29:38.895 --> 29:41.825
Why didn't you tell us you were there
the night your brother got killed?

29:41.849 --> 29:43.328
You get jealous of the golden boy

29:43.352 --> 29:45.743
while you were stuck at home
taking care of the family?

29:45.767 --> 29:47.902
Maybe decided to do
something about it?

29:48.280 --> 29:50.332
Like maybe mess around
with your brother's engine?

29:50.356 --> 29:52.667
No way. I was there
because I wanted to bet Stringer

29:52.691 --> 29:54.255
that James would beat Tokkan.

29:54.279 --> 29:56.054
And it was a safe bet.

29:56.078 --> 29:58.998
- James had the fix in. He had this...
- Naval battery?

30:00.376 --> 30:04.101
Yeah. He said
it guaranteed him the win.

30:04.125 --> 30:05.957
Well, it didn't. It's what killed him.

30:06.632 --> 30:09.384
That in combination
with his NOS system.

30:10.303 --> 30:12.984
I was gonna use the money
to help fix this garage up,

30:13.008 --> 30:17.392
but now I owe the bank and Stringer
and I just don't have it.

30:17.936 --> 30:19.098
How much are you in for?

30:20.688 --> 30:21.993
Seventy K.

30:22.017 --> 30:23.471
Where's the other battery?

30:24.317 --> 30:25.811
I didn't know there was another one.

30:27.529 --> 30:28.880
- I swear to God.
- Okay.

30:28.904 --> 30:32.157
Your mechanic.
Where can we find Omar Alvarez?

30:32.784 --> 30:34.492
I don't know.

30:37.706 --> 30:40.434
Omar runs with
the Los Locos Lowriders.

30:40.458 --> 30:43.117
You find them, you'll find him.

30:43.545 --> 30:47.471
Eric? I need a list of known hangouts
for Los Locos Lowriders.

30:47.495 --> 30:49.643
Mr. Walinski,
you're approaching an intersection

30:49.667 --> 30:51.427
where the traffic signals
are malfunctioning.

30:52.471 --> 30:53.527
What will you do?

30:53.551 --> 30:54.730
- Yeah?
- Callen,

30:54.754 --> 30:55.987
Sam and Kensi

30:56.011 --> 30:58.615
are going after the Rachetheads'
mechanic, Omar Alvarez.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.198
Mr. Walinski!

31:00.222 --> 31:01.783
All right, great. Keep me posted.

31:01.807 --> 31:04.662
For shame, Mr. Walinski. For shame.

31:04.686 --> 31:06.733
Shouldn't he be wearing a seatbelt?

31:29.635 --> 31:32.838
I hope this
works. It's possible we're too late.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.015
Omar Alvarez?

31:40.187 --> 31:41.895
Calm down. Where you going?

31:42.398 --> 31:44.390
Put your hands on the hood.

31:45.901 --> 31:49.187
Federal agents. Stay back.
Don't get cute.

32:00.473 --> 32:02.596
What you got here, huh?

32:04.436 --> 32:06.475
- What is this?
- Whoa.

32:06.730 --> 32:08.330
Lot of cash for
an unemployed mechanic

32:08.354 --> 32:09.874
who hasn't been paid in weeks.

32:09.898 --> 32:12.000
Where's the Naval battery, Omar?

32:12.024 --> 32:13.771
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:20.744 --> 32:23.069
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Stay still.

32:24.581 --> 32:26.930
What is that thing, huh?

32:26.954 --> 32:28.975
How long do you think he's got?

32:28.999 --> 32:30.972
I'd say no more than three hours.

32:30.996 --> 32:32.963
I'm thinking closer to two.

32:33.340 --> 32:34.396
Yeah, right, man.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.062
Look, I want my lawyer, okay?

32:36.086 --> 32:38.359
Buddy, if I were you,
I'd want my doctor.

32:38.383 --> 32:40.737
Yeah. You've got radiation sickness

32:40.761 --> 32:43.659
from exposure to an experimental
Naval battery, Omar.

32:43.683 --> 32:45.784
You know
what radiation sickness does?

32:45.808 --> 32:49.205
Your hair falls out, your skin blisters,
you bleed from every orifice.

32:49.229 --> 32:50.620
Every orifice.

32:50.644 --> 32:54.043
Okay. Okay, so you're gonna take me
to the hospital, right?

32:54.067 --> 32:57.487
You gonna tell where the battery is and
who sabotaged James Rush's car?

32:58.783 --> 33:00.752
- I think he's starting to sweat.
- Huh?

33:00.776 --> 33:02.921
Yeah. It's hyperhidrosis.

33:02.945 --> 33:04.260
What do you mean?

33:04.284 --> 33:07.468
Your heart should be racing by now.
That's tachycardia setting in.

33:07.492 --> 33:08.723
You feel it?

33:08.747 --> 33:10.555
If we don't take him
to the hospital fast,

33:10.579 --> 33:13.648
his tongue's gonna swell,
they'll intubate, he won't able to talk.

33:13.672 --> 33:17.150
My tongue? Look, you gotta take me
to the emergency room, man.

33:17.174 --> 33:18.375
That's the law.

33:19.221 --> 33:22.566
Seriously, I don't know anything
about sabotaging James' car.

33:22.590 --> 33:24.735
Look, I liked James, man.

33:24.759 --> 33:27.319
Look, I worked for his family
for a long time.

33:27.343 --> 33:28.873
Even when they couldn't pay me.

33:28.897 --> 33:30.583
Is that why you stole the battery?

33:30.607 --> 33:33.538
Come on. Don't you think you owe it
to James to tell us where it is?

33:33.562 --> 33:37.187
Look, I sold it to this cat named
Stringer, okay?

33:38.074 --> 33:39.710
Stringer is probably a ghost by now.

33:39.734 --> 33:41.510
With billions in Naval technology.

33:41.534 --> 33:44.633
What about me, huh?
I got radiation poisoning.

33:44.657 --> 33:46.989
- Come on. I need medical attention.
- Hey, hey, hey.

33:47.459 --> 33:48.953
I'm gonna give you
two of these, okay?

33:49.878 --> 33:51.705
This will help you.

33:57.219 --> 33:58.547
All right. Better?

33:59.721 --> 34:01.405
Man, these are breath mints.

34:01.429 --> 34:04.361
Never underestimate the importance
of good oral hygiene.

34:04.385 --> 34:06.279
- Let's go.
- I got radiation poisoning?

34:06.303 --> 34:08.056
No. Make a path.

34:08.272 --> 34:10.205
That's it. Time's up.

34:10.228 --> 34:12.248
Pencils down.

34:12.273 --> 34:15.609
All the way down, Mr. Walinski.

34:16.112 --> 34:19.754
You'll be informed of your scores
via electronic mail.

34:19.777 --> 34:24.387
And hey, drive safely out there.

34:24.411 --> 34:27.534
Well, that was fun.

34:27.917 --> 34:30.752
Yeah, no kidding.

34:33.630 --> 34:36.205
Would you like to grab a bite to eat?

34:36.801 --> 34:40.312
Maybe a drink
to celebrate our graduation?

34:40.335 --> 34:43.135
I could do that. Definitely.

34:46.143 --> 34:49.157
Something just came up.
Tomorrow?

34:49.181 --> 34:52.248
I'm on the redeye tonight
for the Bahamas.

34:52.273 --> 34:54.078
Nice. Vacation?

34:54.101 --> 34:56.235
Swimsuit photo shoot.

34:58.156 --> 35:01.111
Could be a vacation
if I had some company.

35:04.038 --> 35:06.220
If he's smart, Stringer's moved on.

35:06.244 --> 35:10.305
Maybe. But he probably doesn't know
what that battery technology is worth.

35:10.329 --> 35:12.460
If he does, he'll sell it
to the highest bidder.

35:12.880 --> 35:15.181
Stringer's an adrenaline-addicted
personality

35:15.205 --> 35:16.687
who's got his hands on something

35:16.711 --> 35:18.900
that'll give him the edge
over anyone he races.

35:18.924 --> 35:20.814
He won't be able to resist.

35:20.838 --> 35:24.193
Trouble is we don't know
where the next street race takes place.

35:24.217 --> 35:27.322
We don't, but I believe we know
a certain female street racer

35:27.346 --> 35:28.599
who can find out.

35:29.898 --> 35:30.905
You're right.

35:30.929 --> 35:34.748
Stringer contacted Tokkan.
He wants to race her tonight.

35:34.772 --> 35:36.415
Very little time to set up.

35:36.439 --> 35:38.332
We're only gonna get one chance
at this.

35:38.356 --> 35:41.045
Then let's not screw it up.

35:41.069 --> 35:44.588
Having said that, I've made
some adjustments to the Challenger.

35:44.612 --> 35:47.931
- My Challenger?
- It may be your car, Sam,

35:47.955 --> 35:50.414
but Uncle Sam pays the gas.

35:51.086 --> 35:55.012
Anyway, it's not state-of-the-art
Naval technology,

35:55.036 --> 35:58.133
but it'll give it a little extra oomph
if you need it.

36:01.722 --> 36:03.073
My car?

36:03.097 --> 36:08.177
From what we've seen, Mr. Callen,
you don't seem to need any help.

36:09.480 --> 36:10.511
I figured.

36:45.434 --> 36:49.384
Federal agents. Nick Stringer,
get down on the ground now!

36:53.567 --> 36:54.788
I'd do what the lady says.

36:54.812 --> 36:57.025
Everybody stay cool.
We're only here for Stringer.

36:59.532 --> 37:02.023
- Don't do it.
- Don't. Stop!

37:19.511 --> 37:22.381
Clearly this guy hasn't read
the California Driving Manual.

37:30.147 --> 37:32.614
Failure to use a turn signal.
Running a red light.

37:32.638 --> 37:35.105
- At least ten points.
- I'm a little busy here, G.

37:41.575 --> 37:43.010
Thought you knew how to drive this.

37:43.034 --> 37:44.862
Maybe I should drop
some dead weight.

37:47.706 --> 37:48.714
This guy's good.

37:48.738 --> 37:50.220
- Yeah.
- He's good.

37:50.244 --> 37:51.960
- We're better.
- We?

38:03.473 --> 38:05.880
Come on, Hetty.
Show me what you got.

38:07.769 --> 38:09.073
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

38:09.097 --> 38:11.228
What did she do to this thing?

38:11.731 --> 38:13.309
Whoo!

38:47.935 --> 38:50.070
Down on the ground.

38:50.094 --> 38:51.302
Don't move.

38:52.690 --> 38:54.208
What the hell you got
in that thing, dude?

38:54.232 --> 38:56.535
So above your pay grade,
wouldn't recognise the view.

38:56.559 --> 39:00.271
How was your flight?
Turn over. Turn over!

39:00.532 --> 39:02.655
Put your hands behind your back.

39:05.286 --> 39:06.318
Get up.

39:07.706 --> 39:09.057
Jackpot.

39:09.081 --> 39:10.529
We got the battery.

39:16.673 --> 39:18.108
There you have it.

39:18.132 --> 39:22.108
Stringer copped to everything
except killing James Rush.

39:22.132 --> 39:24.818
- No surprises there.
- I don't think it's him.

39:24.842 --> 39:26.070
Neither do I.

39:26.094 --> 39:29.825
Well, if it's not him, it's not Keith,
it's not Alvarez,

39:29.849 --> 39:31.349
who would want Rush dead?

39:31.897 --> 39:33.830
We must have missed an enemy.

39:33.854 --> 39:36.350
Somebody else that didn't want him
on that track.

39:40.781 --> 39:43.070
- What do you got?
- Just a hunch.

39:56.214 --> 39:57.815
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:57.839 --> 39:59.751
Thought you weren't
coming back here.

40:00.343 --> 40:02.989
I had to get things sorted out
for Keith.

40:03.013 --> 40:06.655
As it is, this place is gonna be
a disaster by the end of the week.

40:06.679 --> 40:08.428
I have to move on with my life.

40:09.102 --> 40:10.988
Keith told me
that you caught Stringer.

40:11.012 --> 40:12.623
Yeah.

40:12.647 --> 40:16.764
Him and Alvarez went after the battery.
They thought they could sell it.

40:17.736 --> 40:23.157
But... that doesn't explain
who wanted your brother dead.

40:23.742 --> 40:25.819
And then it hit me.

40:26.871 --> 40:29.053
It wasn't about
who wanted your brother dead.

40:29.077 --> 40:32.035
It was about
who wanted him to stop racing.

40:34.045 --> 40:36.452
We were looking for an enemy,

40:37.757 --> 40:40.509
but we should have been looking
for a loved one.

40:41.010 --> 40:42.670
Someone he trusted.

40:43.471 --> 40:46.141
Someone with easy access
to his car.

40:49.436 --> 40:50.634
Angela?

40:54.858 --> 40:58.938
I just wanted it to end.

41:00.989 --> 41:03.029
I wanted him to stop racing.

41:10.040 --> 41:16.244
I disconnected his NOS injector
after he ran his pre-race inspection.

41:17.381 --> 41:21.082
It was just supposed to bleed out,
no harm done.

41:23.095 --> 41:27.093
He didn't tell me that he swapped out
his battery system.

41:29.310 --> 41:31.219
I was just trying to save him.

41:32.605 --> 41:35.440
I was just trying...

41:45.201 --> 41:48.202
Well, the Navy's relieved
to get their technology back.

41:49.039 --> 41:50.509
And they're not
gonna pursue charges.

41:50.533 --> 41:52.747
Good.
That family has suffered enough.

41:58.757 --> 42:00.642
- Where are you guys going?
- Nowhere.

42:00.666 --> 42:03.131
You're taking out the Challenger,
right?

42:03.971 --> 42:06.070
Zero to 60 before you can sneeze.

42:06.094 --> 42:07.925
Take me with you
or I'm telling Hetty.

42:08.559 --> 42:09.887
What is this, third grade?

42:11.437 --> 42:14.034
Okay. But you're not driving.

42:14.058 --> 42:15.476
Pfft!

42:18.569 --> 42:19.980
Going somewhere?

42:20.404 --> 42:21.733
- Boatshed.
- We got a lead.

42:22.156 --> 42:26.296
Uh, we have a lead and we
are questioning him in the boatshed.

42:26.320 --> 42:30.302
Oh, I hope you guys are better liars
out on the street.

42:30.326 --> 42:32.681
Hetty, I'm offended.

42:32.705 --> 42:34.262
Tough.

42:34.286 --> 42:37.462
I've removed the supercharger
from the Challenger.

42:37.881 --> 42:40.811
- Why would you do that?
- Oh, jeez. I wonder.

42:40.835 --> 42:42.645
You wanna
do something constructive?

42:42.669 --> 42:47.032
Take Mr. Callen out to a parking lot
and teach him how to drive.

42:47.056 --> 42:49.572
All right, I happen to be
a great driver.

42:49.596 --> 42:51.986
Not according to your traffic school.

42:52.010 --> 42:54.785
They just called your alias.
You failed.

42:54.809 --> 42:58.042
- How could you fail traffic school?
- What?

42:58.066 --> 43:00.583
I was working on a case.

43:00.607 --> 43:02.250
You need a note for your teacher?

43:02.274 --> 43:03.835
I'd settle for a little appreciation.

43:03.859 --> 43:05.459
Okay? I passed up the Bahamas
to be here.

43:22.552 --> 43:24.710
Whoo!

43:26.848 --> 43:29.932
I gotta get one of these.
