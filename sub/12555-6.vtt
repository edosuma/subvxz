00:08.300 --> 00:10.792
<i>BEYOND THAT

00:10.886 --> 00:13.469
<i>IT IS A DIMENSION
AS VAST AS SPACE</i>

00:13.555 --> 00:16.091
<i>AND AS TIMELESS AS INFINITY.</i>

00:16.183 --> 00:20.051

00:20.145 --> 00:22.603
<i>BETWEEN SCIENCE
AND SUPERSTITION,</i>

00:22.689 --> 00:26.023

00:28.904 --> 00:31.396
<i>THIS IS THE DIMENSION
OF IMAGINATION.</i>

00:31.490 --> 00:39.490

<i>THE LIFE AND WELLBEING

01:07.192 --> 01:09.433

<i>THAT IF WALTER BEDEKER

YOU A QUESTION.</i>

01:27.796 --> 01:29.332
HOW BAD IS IT?

01:29.423 --> 01:31.084
OH, IT ISN'T
BAD AT ALL.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.380
IT'S QUITE GOOD.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.938
WHAT ABOUT FOUR
SLEEPLESS NIGHTS IN A ROW?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.265
WHAT ABOUT THAT?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.941
<i>WHAT ABOUT THAT?</i>

01:51.028 --> 01:53.690
THAT, MR. BEDEKER,
IS PSYCHOSOMATIC.

01:53.780 --> 01:57.398
PSYCHO-- YOU MEAN THAT
I'M SICK ONLY IN MY MIND?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.620
THAT IS MY
CONSIDERED OPINION.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.445
MR. BEDEKER, THERE'S
NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU

02:02.539 --> 02:05.702
EXCEPT THESE AILMENTS

<i>YOUR PAINS ARE IMAGINARY.</i>

02:07.669 --> 02:10.286

<i>NOTHING MORE.</i>

02:12.215 --> 02:15.753
IN SHORT, MR. BEDEKER,
YOU'RE A VERY HEALTHY MAN.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.960
<i>YOU SEE,
THAT'S A DOCTOR.</i>

02:18.055 --> 02:20.592

02:24.478 --> 02:26.389
I ASK YOU, WHAT IS HE?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.970

04:09.040 --> 04:12.169
<i>(Walter) FREEZING AIR
BLASTING INTO THE ROOM.</i>

YOU KNOW HOW MANY
GERMS THERE ARE

04:14.963 --> 04:17.500
IN A CUBIC FOOT

04:17.591 --> 04:19.673
(both)
8,900,000.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.421
I KNOW YOU
WANT ME TO DIE.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.468
THAT'S WHY YOU
LEAVE WINDOWS OPEN.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.886
BUT, AS A POINT
OF DECENCY,

04:24.973 --> 04:26.759
COULDN'T YOU DO
IT MORE SUBTLY?

04:26.850 --> 04:29.342
THE DOCTOR SAID IT VVAS STUFFY.
YOU NEED FRESH AIR.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.177
WHAT HAVE
YOU GOT THERE?

04:31.271 --> 04:35.435
I'M VVELL, BUT HE GIVES
YOU PRESCRIPTIONS FOR ME.

04:35.525 --> 04:37.027
HE SAYS I'M NOT SICK

04:37.110 --> 04:38.976
BUT, WHILE I LIE
HERE HELPLESS,

04:39.070 --> 04:42.904
HE TELLS YOU I'VE GOT A LIFE
EXPECTANCY OF 2O MINUTES.

04:42.991 --> 04:45.858
DON'T DENY IT, ETHEL.
I COULD <i>SMELL</i> THE COLLUSION.

04:45.952 --> 04:48.535
IT WAS FOR VITAMINS,
WALTER, FOR ME.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.863
VITAMINS FOR <i>YOU?</i>

04:50.916 --> 04:53.408
HERE I LIE,

04:53.502 --> 04:55.288
WITH MY LIFE
EBBING AWAY,

04:55.378 --> 04:57.585
AND THAT QUACK PRESCRIBES
VITAMINS FOR YOU.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.801

BUT SHE GETS VITAMINS.

05:00.884 --> 05:04.752
STOP, ETHEL. GET OUT OF HERE.
LET ME DIE IN PEACE.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.632
ALL RIGHT, WALTER.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.225
WHAT?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.050
I SIMPLY MEANT
THAT I'D LET YOU ALONE

05:11.144 --> 05:13.636
SO YOU CAN TAKE A LITTLE NAP.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.721
I CAN'T NAP.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.184
WHY DOES A MAN HAVE TO DIE?

05:19.277 --> 05:20.563
I ASKED YOU
A QUESTION.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.774
WHY DOES A MAN HAVE TO DIE?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.980
THE WORLD GOES ON
FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS,

05:25.075 --> 05:26.907
AND HOW LONG
IS A MAN'S LIFE?

05:26.993 --> 05:29.826
THIS MUCH. A DROP.
A MICROSCOPIC FRAGMENT.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.405
WHY CAN'T A MAN
LIVE 500 YEARS,

05:32.457 --> 05:34.414
OR A THOUSAND? VVHY
DOES HE HAVE TO DIE

05:34.459 --> 05:36.166
ALMOST THE MOMENT
HE'S BORN?

05:36.253 --> 05:37.414
I DON'T KNOW, DEAR.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.915
OF COURSE
YOU WOULDN'T.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.837
GO ON. GET OUT

05:46.221 --> 05:47.427
<i>[grumbling]</i>

05:47.514 --> 05:49.004

05:49.099 --> 05:52.592
TO LIVE SUCH A SHORT
SPAN OF YEARS.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.973
WHY CAN'T A MAN LIVE
A DECENT NUMBER OF YEARS?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.474
200? 300?

05:56.565 --> 05:57.771
<i>(male)
WHY NOT 500? 600?</i>

05:57.858 --> 05:59.348

CADWALLADER'S MY NAM E.

06:22.257 --> 06:26.046
AT LEAST IT'S THE NAME

IT HAS A NICE FEELING

06:28.305 --> 06:29.386
"CADWALLADER."

06:37.314 --> 06:39.225
HOW'D YOU
GET IN HERE?

06:39.316 --> 06:40.898
I'VE NEVER BEEN GONE.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.474
I'VE BEEN HERE
FOR SOME TIME.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.310
I'LL MAKE IT BRIEF,
MR. BEDEKER.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.986
YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN

06:46.072 --> 06:47.574
WITH A NOSE
FOR A BARGAIN,

06:47.657 --> 06:49.568
SO I'D LIKE TO MAKE
YOU A PROPOSITION.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.696
WE EACH HAVE SOMETHING
THE OTHER WANTS.

06:51.786 --> 06:54.915
THAT SEEMS A RELATIVELY
SOLID BASIS FOR A BARGAIN.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.911
DOES IT?

06:58.001 --> 06:59.491
AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE

06:59.586 --> 07:01.327
THAT COULD POSSIBLY
INTEREST ME?

07:01.379 --> 07:03.666
A GREAT MANY THINGS.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.919
OH, YOU'D BE SURPRISED, MR.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.127
MANY THINGS,
VARIED AND DELIGHTFUL.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.597
AND WHAT DO I HAVE

07:10.680 --> 07:12.546
THAT COULD REMOTELY
INTEREST YOU?

07:12.641 --> 07:15.383
ACTUALLY, A MINOR ITEM.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.139
IN FACT,
SOMETHING LESS THAN MINOR,

07:18.229 --> 07:19.845
INSIGNIFICANT,

07:19.940 --> 07:24.104
INFINITESIMAL, MICROSCOPIC,
TEENSY-WEENSY.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.185
WHAT DID YOU SAY
YOUR NAME WAS?

07:26.279 --> 07:29.692
WHAT'S IN A NAME,
MR. BEDEKER, REALLY?

07:29.783 --> 07:32.070
IT'S A MERE QUESTION
OF SEMANTICS.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.321
JUST LANGUAGE.

07:33.411 --> 07:35.402
A MERE STRETCH OF WORDS.

07:35.497 --> 07:36.658
FOR EXAMPLE,

07:36.748 --> 07:38.113
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

07:38.208 --> 07:43.328
YOU WANT AN EXTENDED
LIFE-SPAN.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.537
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS
TO PLAY AROUND WITH.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.374
SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL
THAT IMMORTALITY.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.711
BUT WHY MAKE IT
SOUND SO IMPOSING?

07:51.763 --> 07:54.801
LET'S CALL lT--
JUST THE TWO OF US--

07:54.891 --> 07:56.632
LET'S CALL IT

07:56.726 --> 07:59.969
"SOME ADDITIONAL
FREE TIME."

08:00.063 --> 08:01.974
AFTER ALL, WHAT ARE
A FEW HUNDRED YEARS

08:02.065 --> 08:03.180
OR A FEW THOUSAND?

08:03.274 --> 08:04.435
A FEW THOUSAND?

08:04.526 --> 08:05.982
5,000, 10,000?

08:06.069 --> 08:07.730
WHAT IS IT IN
THE SCHEME OF THINGS?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.562
THE WORLD WILL GO ON
AD lNFINITUM.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.738
SO WHAT ARE A FEW
THOUSAND YEARS

08:11.825 --> 08:13.782
MORE OR LESS,

08:16.621 --> 08:18.362
THAT YOU WANT
IN RETURN

08:18.456 --> 08:21.665
WHAT DO WE
CALL THAT?

08:21.751 --> 08:26.120
WELL, WHAT COULD
WE CALL THAT?

08:26.214 --> 08:27.796
WE COULD CALL IT

08:27.882 --> 08:29.293
UH,

08:29.384 --> 08:31.751
A LITTLE PIECE
OF YOUR MAKEUP,

08:31.845 --> 08:35.087
A CRUMB OFF THE CRUST
OF YOUR STRUCTURE

08:35.181 --> 08:38.845
A FRAGMENT OF AN ATOM
OF YOUR BEING, OR,

08:38.934 --> 08:41.393
OR WHAT?

08:41.479 --> 08:42.934

09:12.677 --> 09:14.634
<i>CERTAINLY. WHY
NOT FOREVER?</i>

09:14.721 --> 09:17.634
