08:54.264 --> 08:56.706
Other than the tape, there's
really not a Mark on her.

08:56.707 --> 09:00.269
She has a rash on her
cheek and both of her wrists.

09:00.270 --> 09:01.611
Yes, I'm aware of the rash.

09:01.612 --> 09:05.575
I meant nothing obvious
to suggest cause of death.

09:05.576 --> 09:07.647
So how did you die?

09:07.648 --> 09:11.320
I've sat in this kitchen
a hundred times.

09:11.321 --> 09:14.884
Robyn over there at the stove,

09:14.885 --> 09:18.057
Mike at the counter,
cold beer in his hand...

09:18.058 --> 09:20.690
I can picture 'em right now.

09:20.691 --> 09:22.662
Mr. Kreger, uh,

09:22.663 --> 09:25.635
you and Mike were business
partners for ten years?

09:25.636 --> 09:27.697
(Sighs) Yeah, we,
uh... (Clears throat)

09:27.698 --> 09:30.700
We had the store together
for ten years, but, um...

09:30.701 --> 09:32.642
Our friendship
goes back forever.

09:32.643 --> 09:34.874
I'm the one who
introduced Mike and Robyn.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.046
He was honestly the most...

09:37.047 --> 09:39.879
Focused and driven
person I've ever known.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.811
Everything he did, he did right.

09:41.812 --> 09:43.654
Just look at that kid of theirs.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.588
Why didn't he just
open the damn safe?

09:50.090 --> 09:52.623
They'd be alive right now.

09:55.666 --> 09:57.768
Excuse me.

10:00.671 --> 10:01.802
Greg.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.634
You can't be here.

10:04.635 --> 10:07.336
I just... I just want
some of my things.

10:07.337 --> 10:10.240
Very soon. I promise.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.883
So what happens next?

10:13.884 --> 10:16.086
I mean, to me.

10:17.648 --> 10:20.319
My parents are dead.
What am I supposed to do?

10:20.320 --> 10:22.793
Child protective services
hasn't called you yet?

10:24.995 --> 10:26.325
(Sighs)

10:26.326 --> 10:28.097
Well, you got a place
to stay for now, right,

10:28.098 --> 10:29.759
with your buddy Travis?

10:29.760 --> 10:32.963
Yeah, but... but then what?

10:44.975 --> 10:48.117
(Exhales deeply)

10:48.118 --> 10:49.648
According to the
insurance records,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.782
there are six pieces of
jewelry unaccounted for.

10:52.783 --> 10:54.053
Could be in the safe.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.424
Won't know till it's opened.

10:55.425 --> 10:56.756
Just the same,
let's get these out

10:56.757 --> 10:58.327
to every pawnshop
and fence we know,

10:58.328 --> 11:00.761
just in case someone tries...

11:02.162 --> 11:04.864
What is it, bud?

11:04.865 --> 11:06.937
What is it?

11:09.700 --> 11:11.741
"L & p plumbing." So what?

11:11.742 --> 11:13.342
The other two home
invasion robberies nearby,

11:13.343 --> 11:16.806
both had work done by l & p
a week before they were hit.

11:16.807 --> 11:18.147
Anybody interview the guy?

11:18.148 --> 11:20.780
Yeah. They decided
it was a coincidence.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.712
But a third time?

11:22.713 --> 11:24.183
I don't buy it.

11:24.184 --> 11:25.855
(Megan) We have
sharp-force trauma

11:25.856 --> 11:29.388
from the anterior left to
the anterior right of the neck,

11:29.389 --> 11:31.160
serrated blade.

11:31.161 --> 11:33.723
From the angle and
position of the incision,

11:33.724 --> 11:35.965
the killer was right-handed

11:35.966 --> 11:38.828
and was positioned
behind the decedent

11:38.829 --> 11:41.871
when the laceration was made.

11:41.872 --> 11:43.733
Ethan, I need swabs.

11:43.734 --> 11:45.174
Oh, sorry.

11:45.175 --> 11:46.936
You find something?

11:46.937 --> 11:50.480
There are some cuts
right above the incision.

11:52.142 --> 11:54.313
Hesitation marks.
(Camera shutter clicking)

11:54.314 --> 11:55.845
The killer was unsure.

11:55.846 --> 11:57.046
Or the killer was threatening,

11:57.047 --> 11:58.748
holding the knife
to Mike's throat,

11:58.749 --> 12:00.750
demanding that he open the safe.

12:00.751 --> 12:03.422
There's something in them,
probably from the knife.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.924
Robyn Lux died
of simple asphyxia,

12:04.925 --> 12:06.725
but I still have a mystery.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.257
What do you mean?

12:08.258 --> 12:10.299
With tape over her mouth,
her nose was her only airway.

12:10.300 --> 12:13.402
But at some point, her sinuses
became inflamed or congested.

12:13.403 --> 12:14.904
The thing is, though,
there's no sign of acute

12:14.905 --> 12:16.235
or chronic sinus condition.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.808
So what made 'em close up?

12:18.809 --> 12:20.109
(Megan and Kate) The rash.

12:20.110 --> 12:21.841
She had an allergic reaction.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.913
Ethan, hand me... Thank you.

12:23.914 --> 12:25.074
You're welcome.

12:25.075 --> 12:26.515
(Kate) Yeah.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.077
See the wheals and flares?

12:28.078 --> 12:29.478
Yeah. It's contact urticaria.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.350
She had a reaction to something
she came in contact with.

12:31.351 --> 12:32.953
Maybe something from the killer.

12:35.155 --> 12:39.088
So, Lee, you did plumbing
work at both these houses

12:39.089 --> 12:40.890
and both were hit

12:40.891 --> 12:42.793
by home-invasion
robbers soon after.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.935
I work on a lot of houses.

12:45.936 --> 12:47.967
I've been over
this with the cops.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.199
Those were robbery cops, Lee.

12:50.200 --> 12:52.341
You're talking to homicide now.

12:52.342 --> 12:54.543
(Sam) Another home invasion.

12:54.544 --> 12:57.176
And guess whose card
we found on the fridge.

12:57.177 --> 12:58.948
I got nothing to do
with that. No way.

12:58.949 --> 13:00.109
Really?

13:00.110 --> 13:02.011
Because right now,

13:02.012 --> 13:04.914
our guys are turning
that house upside down.

13:04.915 --> 13:06.856
They're gathering every hair

13:06.857 --> 13:11.060
and every discarded skin
cell that doesn't belong.

13:11.061 --> 13:12.963
What do you think
they're gonna find, Lee?

13:15.966 --> 13:19.969
(People speaking indistinctly)

13:19.970 --> 13:22.271
You don't trust
Kate's work, huh?

13:22.272 --> 13:24.934
(Sighs) I trust Kate just fine.

13:24.935 --> 13:26.275
(Chuckles)

13:26.276 --> 13:27.937
I just wanted to see
the bodies side by side.

13:27.938 --> 13:29.939
Sometimes when I
look at the big picture,

13:29.940 --> 13:31.941
I find something that I missed.

13:31.942 --> 13:33.382
And?

13:33.383 --> 13:36.285
Look at the restraint
marks on Mike's wrists

13:36.286 --> 13:38.447
and then look at Robyn's.

13:38.448 --> 13:41.250
His are severe. Hers
are practically nonexistent.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.893
Well, he probably
struggled a lot harder.

13:43.894 --> 13:45.194
That would certainly
fit in with what we know

13:45.195 --> 13:46.825
about his personality.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.127
Right, but keep in mind

13:48.128 --> 13:51.060
that Robyn's death was
probably unintentional.

13:51.061 --> 13:52.932
Obviously, you have a theory.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.233
Yes, I do.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.834
Hmm? The killer

13:55.835 --> 13:57.836
loosely bound Robyn's
wrists so as not to hurt her

13:57.837 --> 14:00.870
and then put her in
the closet to protect her.

14:00.871 --> 14:03.072
Robyn Lux knew her killer.

14:03.073 --> 14:05.244
More than that.

14:05.245 --> 14:08.248
He cared about her.

14:17.387 --> 14:18.988
(Indistinct conversations)

14:18.989 --> 14:20.289
Ethan, have you
heard from the lab

14:20.290 --> 14:22.161
if they found out what
caused Robyn Lux's rash?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.392
They called.

14:23.393 --> 14:25.965
I-I just haven't had
time to call them back.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.898
Curtis has me pulling
cases for quality review.

14:28.899 --> 14:31.000
Some of them don't even qualify.

14:31.001 --> 14:32.301
It almost makes
me long for the days

14:32.302 --> 14:34.273
when you were in charge.

14:34.274 --> 14:37.406
Wow. And to think I was this
close to feeling sorry for you.

14:37.407 --> 14:39.108
Call the lab.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.010
Right.

14:41.011 --> 14:42.481
I'm watching you, you know?

14:42.482 --> 14:44.954
I do know, and
it's getting creepy.

14:44.955 --> 14:47.086
I got a delivery
for Dr. Brumfield.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.388
Uh, right here.

14:53.263 --> 14:56.926
(Cuts open box)

14:56.927 --> 14:58.998
What the hell? (Laughing)

14:58.999 --> 15:01.400
What... you think this is funny?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.272
This ain't no damn joke.

15:03.273 --> 15:05.304
Gloves are disappearing,
hundreds of 'em.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.137
Cases and cases gone, vanished.

15:08.138 --> 15:09.278
Curtis, I'm a little concerned

15:09.279 --> 15:11.010
that maybe the
pressure's getting to you.

15:11.011 --> 15:13.212
You damn right,
it's getting to me.

15:13.213 --> 15:16.215
And don't think
I'm not onto you.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.346
(Inhales)

15:17.347 --> 15:20.389
(High-pitched voice)
Viva la revolucion!

15:20.390 --> 15:21.420
(Laughs)

15:21.421 --> 15:25.654
I know, I know, call
the lab, call the lab.

15:25.655 --> 15:28.497
(People speaking indistinctly)

15:28.498 --> 15:30.029
Hey, I talked to Peter.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.360
He said you think, uh,

15:31.361 --> 15:33.202
the killer had
feelings for Robyn.

15:33.203 --> 15:34.433
You think I'm wrong.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.036
I think it's a theory.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.567
Her jewelry... it's pretty
nice stuff, high-end.

15:38.568 --> 15:41.140
Except for this
piece right here.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.441
Yeah, she wore that
under her clothes.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.313
We didn't even find it
till we had her undressed.

15:44.314 --> 15:46.376
I wonder what it meant to her.

15:49.679 --> 15:51.981
Uh, could we...

15:51.982 --> 15:55.124
Pick this up later?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.056
Ohh.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.028
That must be the gardener
Peter was talking about.

15:59.029 --> 16:01.461
(Lowered voice) Landscape
arch... just get out.

16:03.693 --> 16:06.536
Hi.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.301
(Chuckles)

16:12.302 --> 16:14.373
So what do you say to me
stealing you away for lunch?

16:14.374 --> 16:16.305
Oh, I can't. I can't. Not today.

16:16.306 --> 16:19.148
Work always comes
first with you, doesn't it?

16:19.149 --> 16:21.150
Well, I could say
no, but it seems

16:21.151 --> 16:23.352
a little bit too early
to be lying to you, so...

16:23.353 --> 16:24.513
(Both laugh)

16:24.514 --> 16:26.515
Okay. What about tonight?

16:26.516 --> 16:29.458
Oh, I've got Lacey all week.

16:29.459 --> 16:31.460
H-Honestly, I
just... I don't know

16:31.461 --> 16:34.493
when my schedule
is gonna lighten up.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.625
What are you doing, Megan?

16:36.626 --> 16:39.328
I'm being honest. I just...

16:39.329 --> 16:41.500
There's a lot going on
with Lacey right now,

16:41.501 --> 16:43.001
and... and like you
said, my job, and i...

16:43.002 --> 16:45.704
You know, I just don't know
when there's gonna be time

16:45.705 --> 16:47.236
for, you know, us.

16:47.237 --> 16:48.377
How often do you think
you've used that excuse

16:48.378 --> 16:49.578
to push someone away?

16:49.579 --> 16:51.240
(Chuckles)

16:51.241 --> 16:52.642
It's not an excuse.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.620
What are you so scared of?

17:01.621 --> 17:03.253
I'm not.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.401
Um... (Chuckles)

17:13.333 --> 17:14.534
Gonna go.

17:16.506 --> 17:18.167
(Clears throat)

17:18.168 --> 17:20.339
It seems I have a growing
talent for interrupting,

17:20.340 --> 17:22.341
but the lab has
I.D.'Ed the allergen

17:22.342 --> 17:24.173
that caused Robyn
Lux's urticaria rash.

17:24.174 --> 17:26.315
It was a mixture of sea
salt and lemon juice.

17:26.316 --> 17:28.447
Lemon juice is a pretty
common cause of urticaria.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.149
Have you never cleaned anything?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.351
Lemon juice and sea
salt is a metal Polish.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.183
Coin dealers use it
to remove deposits

17:34.184 --> 17:35.484
without scratching the coins.

17:35.485 --> 17:39.057
Dealers, as in
high-end jewelry stores.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.590
Like Mike's partner Owen kreger.

17:41.591 --> 17:44.593
Is this really what
we're gonna talk about?

17:44.594 --> 17:46.595
I-Is this why I'm here?

17:46.596 --> 17:49.468
We found lemon juice
on Robyn Lux's cheek.

17:49.469 --> 17:51.600
According to the m.E.,
it was transferred there

17:51.601 --> 17:54.473
very close to the
time that she died.

17:54.474 --> 17:57.146
(Sam) We also found these
documents in Mike's safe.

17:57.147 --> 17:59.208
They suggest that
your partnership

17:59.209 --> 18:00.679
in fact,

18:00.680 --> 18:02.451
Mike wanted to dissolve it.

18:02.452 --> 18:05.614
"We've been business partners
for ten years, friends forever."

18:05.615 --> 18:07.156
What happened?

18:07.157 --> 18:08.487
Were you stealing from him?

18:08.488 --> 18:09.459
Stealing?

18:09.460 --> 18:10.789
(Chuckles)

18:10.790 --> 18:13.192
We were 50/50 partners.

18:13.193 --> 18:15.125
I owned half of everything.

18:17.227 --> 18:19.868
What about Robyn?

18:19.869 --> 18:21.800
Did you want her?

18:21.801 --> 18:23.502
I'm beginning to think

18:23.503 --> 18:25.634
that this whole home invasion

18:25.635 --> 18:28.607
was really a plan to
have Robyn all to yourself.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.640
Okay, if I wanted Robyn,
why would I kill her?

18:31.641 --> 18:33.482
You didn't mean to.

18:33.483 --> 18:35.384
It was Mike you were after.

18:35.385 --> 18:38.487
You handled Robyn very gently.

18:38.488 --> 18:40.189
You bound her hands loosely.

18:40.190 --> 18:42.621
You put her in the
closet to protect her.

18:42.622 --> 18:47.196
You didn't know she was
going to have an allergic reaction.

18:47.197 --> 18:48.497
Did you caress her face?

18:48.498 --> 18:51.500
Is that how the
lemon juice got there?

18:51.501 --> 18:52.831
(Sighs)

18:52.832 --> 18:56.405
Robyn was wearing...

18:56.406 --> 18:58.637
This...

18:58.638 --> 19:01.240
When she died.

19:01.241 --> 19:03.643
Did you give that to her?

19:06.746 --> 19:09.219
I didn't think she
knew how I felt.

19:12.382 --> 19:13.853
Mike...

19:16.556 --> 19:18.357
He wasn't good to her.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.160
Well, that's not how
you described him before.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.694
She was so much more
before she married him.

19:25.695 --> 19:28.237
I mean... (Sighs)

19:28.238 --> 19:29.538
(Voice breaking)
She was ambitious

19:29.539 --> 19:32.901
and she was funny.

19:32.902 --> 19:36.905
And he just took the
life right out of her.

19:36.906 --> 19:38.607
(Normal voice) So...

19:38.608 --> 19:41.580
Yeah.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.553
I was in love with her.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.788
But I didn't do this.

19:50.860 --> 19:52.862
This wasn't me.

19:56.326 --> 19:58.828
(Sighs)

20:04.274 --> 20:06.205
Lace?

20:10.610 --> 20:12.341
(Jangles keys)

20:12.342 --> 20:14.343
I thought you had
work all day today. I do.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.914
And I have to get
back. (Jangles keys)

20:15.915 --> 20:18.747
But I was feeling bad

20:18.748 --> 20:21.250
about the way things
went down this morning.

20:21.251 --> 20:23.252
I haven't seen you in a week,

20:23.253 --> 20:25.624
and it wasn't a
good way to start.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.398
So I am sorry.

20:29.999 --> 20:31.760
Hmm.

20:31.761 --> 20:34.463
(Inhales deeply)

20:34.464 --> 20:36.406
What are those?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.771
They're for Tyler's band.

20:42.772 --> 20:44.313
I'm not done with them.

20:44.314 --> 20:45.644
I still need to
take some photos,

20:45.645 --> 20:47.716
but I really hope he likes them.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.949
Why wouldn't he?
Lace, these are great.

20:52.822 --> 20:55.884
You, um... (Clears throat)

20:55.885 --> 20:58.787
You do know that...

20:58.788 --> 21:00.629
Tyler is 16,

21:00.630 --> 21:03.632
and that boys, when they're 16,

21:03.633 --> 21:05.694
they're different than
boys that are your age...

21:05.695 --> 21:07.566
O-oh, my god, mom.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.670
Are you trying to
give me the talk?

21:11.641 --> 21:13.873
(Chuckles)

21:18.878 --> 21:21.810
(Laughs)

21:21.811 --> 21:23.452
Ahh.

21:23.453 --> 21:25.414
Do you know that
this was actually pink

21:25.415 --> 21:27.386
when you first got it? (Laughs)

21:27.387 --> 21:29.588
Oh, for whatever reason,

21:29.589 --> 21:31.720
out of all the toys
you got as a baby,

21:31.721 --> 21:33.522
this was the one.

21:33.523 --> 21:37.697
We could never go anywhere
without stinky, remember?

21:39.599 --> 21:40.899
And the only way you
could sleep at night

21:40.900 --> 21:42.401
is if

21:42.402 --> 21:44.773
she was tucked right there,

21:44.774 --> 21:46.576
right under your chin.

21:49.379 --> 21:50.709
Don't forget, tomorrow's

21:50.710 --> 21:53.742
parent-student-teacher
meetings, so...

21:53.743 --> 21:54.883
There's no school.

21:54.884 --> 21:56.485
Yeah, I know.

21:56.486 --> 21:58.517
1:30. Your dad's
gonna be there, too.

21:58.518 --> 21:59.948
And I'm going to Jenna's
tomorrow morning.

21:59.949 --> 22:01.950
I'll have to have
you pick me up.

22:01.951 --> 22:04.523
Fine.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.526
I'll get you right
before the meeting.

22:08.758 --> 22:10.660
(Exhales)

22:20.540 --> 22:21.710
(Elevator bell dings)

22:21.711 --> 22:23.011
(People speaking indistinctly)

22:23.012 --> 22:24.713
I was just calling you.

22:24.714 --> 22:26.745
We got the d.N.A. Results from
the duct tape on Robyn's mouth.

22:26.746 --> 22:27.916
And?

22:27.917 --> 22:29.618
And they found an
unknown sample.

22:29.619 --> 22:31.920
50% match to Robyn, 50% to Mike.

22:31.921 --> 22:33.622
So it's Greg's.

22:33.623 --> 22:35.624
It's not a shocker to find
his d.N.A. In the house.

22:35.625 --> 22:36.925
Except it doesn't match
the elimination sample

22:36.926 --> 22:38.857
we took from Greg.

22:38.858 --> 22:41.631
(People continue
speaking indistinctly)

22:48.768 --> 22:50.068
What's going on?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.070
When you did the
autopsy on Robyn,

22:52.071 --> 22:54.773
did you notice any
signs of multiple births?

22:54.774 --> 22:56.775
No. There was no
evidence of vaginal delivery

22:56.776 --> 23:00.108
and just the one
c-section scar, unless...

23:00.109 --> 23:01.650
Unless?

23:01.651 --> 23:03.612
Sometimes, o.B.S,
to minimize scarring,

23:03.613 --> 23:06.755
do a second c-section
on top of the first, and wow.

23:06.756 --> 23:08.817
This doctor was good.

23:08.818 --> 23:11.119
Yeah, so there is a second scar.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.123
The luxes have another
child out there somewhere.

23:23.673 --> 23:25.634
(Knock on door)

23:25.635 --> 23:28.638
(People speaking indistinctly)

23:31.040 --> 23:33.612
(Knocks)

23:33.613 --> 23:34.984
Travis.

23:36.586 --> 23:37.786
We need to talk to Greg.

23:37.787 --> 23:40.719
He's asleep, I think.

23:40.720 --> 23:42.521
He was up all night again.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.052
Can I help?

23:44.053 --> 23:45.423
Depends.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.425
How much do you know
about Greg's brother?

23:47.426 --> 23:48.897
Greg doesn't have a brother.

23:48.898 --> 23:50.829
We checked birth
and school records.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.831
Aaron Lux would be 20 years old.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.533
No, I've known Greg
since sophomore year.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.505
There isn't any
brother. (Door opens)

23:56.506 --> 23:59.808
No, no, there... there
is, actually, Travis.

23:59.809 --> 24:01.540
I'm sorry I-I never told you.

24:01.541 --> 24:05.143
It's just... We don't
talk about him.

24:05.144 --> 24:06.815
Aaron was a screw up.

24:06.816 --> 24:10.148
He had a real problem
living under my parents rules,

24:10.149 --> 24:11.780
so he took off,

24:11.781 --> 24:13.722
ran away about four years ago.

24:13.723 --> 24:15.584
Greg, I was in your house.

24:15.585 --> 24:17.856
I didn't see a hint of
your brother anywhere.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.990
(Sighs) That's how my dad
decided it was gonna be...

24:21.991 --> 24:23.993
Like he didn't exist.

24:25.635 --> 24:28.036
I think he just wanted it
to be easier for my mom.

24:28.037 --> 24:30.739
I-It broke her heart
when Aaron left,

24:30.740 --> 24:33.672
so he just took any trace of him

24:33.673 --> 24:35.504
and removed it from the house.

24:35.505 --> 24:37.506
That was it.

24:37.507 --> 24:38.877
Do you know where Aaron is now?

24:38.878 --> 24:40.709
Why? Do you think
he's the one that did this?

24:40.710 --> 24:43.713
We just want to find
him and talk to him, okay?

24:44.814 --> 24:46.656
Can you help us?

24:48.518 --> 24:49.818
Yeah, when... when he left,

24:49.819 --> 24:52.591
he s-supposedly
went up to Alaska

24:52.592 --> 24:54.492
to work on some boat.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.225
I never heard from him after.

24:58.628 --> 25:00.669
Okay. Thanks.

25:00.670 --> 25:02.771
(Curtis) Thanks, buddy.

25:02.772 --> 25:04.574
Uh, hey.

25:06.806 --> 25:10.679
You said you were
chief of something, right?

25:10.680 --> 25:12.611
Well, l-look, this... this
guy from social services

25:12.612 --> 25:13.942
keeps calling Travis' mom.

25:13.943 --> 25:15.684
He wants to take me outta here.

25:15.685 --> 25:17.015
I'm chief m.E., Greg.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.787
I really don't have a
lot to do about that.

25:18.788 --> 25:20.919
Please.

25:20.920 --> 25:23.121
Can't you do something?

25:23.122 --> 25:24.723
I-I just don't want
to go... Okay.

25:24.724 --> 25:25.924
To a place where there's
a bunch of s... okay.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.757
Okay, look, I can't
promise anything,

25:28.758 --> 25:30.859
but I'll see what I can do.

25:30.860 --> 25:32.862
Okay?

25:42.712 --> 25:44.713

That singer right there,

25:56.726 --> 25:58.226
that's Tyler.

25:58.227 --> 26:00.659
Lacey has a big crush on him.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.960
What makes you say that?

26:01.961 --> 26:04.833
Well, first of all, he
is the lead singer,

26:04.834 --> 26:06.935
so I probably don't need
to say anything more.

26:06.936 --> 26:09.097
♪ Lift me up ♪

26:09.098 --> 26:11.239
But she just lights up

26:14.203 --> 26:16.244

Mm-hmm.

26:18.778 --> 26:20.078
I don't know.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.250
I've never heard
her mention him.

26:25.584 --> 26:30.218

26:31.590 --> 26:33.662
(Song ends, indistinct
conversations)

26:33.663 --> 26:34.963
Hey, girl.

26:34.964 --> 26:37.295
Hey. Hey. Aren't they amazing?

26:37.296 --> 26:38.797
Yeah. And this isn't
even their best song.

26:38.798 --> 26:39.928
You should hear
the one Tyler wrote.

26:39.929 --> 26:41.770
He's, like, a musical genius.

26:41.771 --> 26:43.902
(Todd) Yeah, no, no, they sound
great, baby. They sound great.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.674
But we gotta go, though, okay?

26:45.675 --> 26:47.706
I know, but go grab your stuff.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.077
Okay. Come on.

26:49.078 --> 26:50.779
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

26:50.780 --> 26:52.180
Okay, stop gloating.

26:52.181 --> 26:54.082
(Chuckles) Why?
I'm so good at it.

26:54.083 --> 26:57.786
Oh... no.

26:57.787 --> 26:58.917
Oh, you have got to...

26:58.918 --> 27:00.248
Tyler has a girlfriend.

27:00.249 --> 27:02.751
Well, he is the lead singer.

27:02.752 --> 27:04.753
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

27:04.754 --> 27:05.854
(Girl) Bye, Lacey.

27:05.855 --> 27:06.995
Bye, guys.

27:06.996 --> 27:08.727
Bye.

27:08.728 --> 27:12.761
(Indistinct
conversations continue)

27:12.762 --> 27:13.932
All right.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.233
Aaron Lux...

27:15.234 --> 27:17.936
Photo's from Alaskan
fish and game.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.938
He applied for a crabbing
license back in '08.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.269
Mm-hmm.

27:21.270 --> 27:22.811
State database doesn't
have a current address.

27:22.812 --> 27:24.172
Considering his d.N.A.
Is on his dead mother,

27:24.173 --> 27:26.715
I got a feeling he's a
lot closer than Alaska.

27:26.716 --> 27:28.116
I've already got
his photo out wide.

27:28.117 --> 27:29.277
(Cell phone rings)

27:29.278 --> 27:31.419
Morris.

27:31.420 --> 27:32.781
Where?

27:32.782 --> 27:34.222
All right, just stall him.

27:34.223 --> 27:36.885
Uh, tell him you need
a second appraiser.

27:36.886 --> 27:38.827
Tell him that all the
cash is locked in the safe.

27:38.828 --> 27:40.689
Just keep him there.

27:40.690 --> 27:41.860
(Beep)

27:41.861 --> 27:45.093
Someone just walked in
to a pawnshop on belmont

27:45.094 --> 27:46.364
with Robyn Lux's jewelry.

27:46.365 --> 27:47.996
(Bell on door jingles)

27:47.997 --> 27:50.038
(Man speaks indistinctly)

27:50.039 --> 27:51.800
Hey, Aaron?

27:51.801 --> 27:53.371
Yeah. How's it going?

27:53.372 --> 27:54.743
(Grunts)

27:54.744 --> 27:55.875
(Handcuffs click)

28:05.114 --> 28:06.955
Come on, Aaron.

28:06.956 --> 28:08.456
Your d.N.A was on the tape
that covered your mother's mouth.

28:08.457 --> 28:09.958
You were pawning her jewelry.

28:09.959 --> 28:12.821
Tell me there's something
I'm not seeing here.

28:12.822 --> 28:15.093
(Sam) I'll tell you
what I'm seeing, bud.

28:15.094 --> 28:17.425
A kid who thought
he was a badass,

28:17.426 --> 28:19.968
thought he didn't
have to follow any rules.

28:19.969 --> 28:21.469
Only when he got
out into the real world,

28:21.470 --> 28:22.431
he couldn't hack it.

28:22.432 --> 28:26.304
So he came back to
prey on his own family.

28:26.305 --> 28:27.936
You don't know anything about me

28:27.937 --> 28:30.108
or my family.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.439
The only crime I committed

28:31.440 --> 28:33.041
was not being good
enough for my father.

28:33.042 --> 28:34.382
Old story, Aaron.

28:34.383 --> 28:37.185
All teenagers have
issues with their parents.

28:37.186 --> 28:39.848
Oh, and do they all get the
crap kicked out of them, too?

28:39.849 --> 28:41.349
So your father was abusing you?

28:41.350 --> 28:42.951
Why? You were a bad boy?

28:42.952 --> 28:45.223
No, because I was average,

28:45.224 --> 28:47.025
and he couldn't deal with that.

28:47.026 --> 28:49.928
I sucked at sports, I
struggled to make b's,

28:49.929 --> 28:51.760
so he beat me.

28:51.761 --> 28:54.102
He beat me until I finally left.

28:54.103 --> 28:55.804
(Blows air) I don't know, Aaron.

28:55.805 --> 28:57.265
I've been to your house.

28:57.266 --> 28:59.307
Everything there seems
pretty d... perfect, right?

28:59.308 --> 29:02.170
Because my mother was
scared to death of him.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.371
Greg, too.

29:03.372 --> 29:06.375
(Clattering)

29:08.818 --> 29:10.979
What? She gave it to me.

29:10.980 --> 29:13.481
Was that before or after
you tossed her in a closet

29:13.482 --> 29:15.523
and slit your father's throat?

29:15.524 --> 29:17.956
None of that!

29:17.957 --> 29:19.457
I was dead to my father,

29:19.458 --> 29:21.459
but my mother and I
kept in touch always,

29:21.460 --> 29:23.531
and secretly, so
he wouldn't know.

29:23.532 --> 29:25.493
And so she just
gave you her jewelry?

29:25.494 --> 29:27.195
She couldn't give me cash,

29:27.196 --> 29:28.837
'cause my dad watched
the finances too closely.

29:28.838 --> 29:30.839
He counted every penny.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.470
But he gave her tons of jewelry.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.072
I kissed her good-bye after.

29:34.073 --> 29:36.475
I mean, maybe that's
how my d.N.A. Got on her.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.248
Look...

29:40.249 --> 29:44.112
I admit, I wished my
father dead a million times,

29:44.113 --> 29:46.815
but I did not kill him.

29:46.816 --> 29:48.987
My only regret in this

29:48.988 --> 29:51.921
is leaving Greg behind
with that monster.

29:56.225 --> 29:58.827
Ethan, what are
you still doing here?

29:58.828 --> 30:00.869
I'm trying to I.D.
This substance

30:00.870 --> 30:03.101
that Megan found on
Mike Lux's wounds.

30:03.102 --> 30:05.073
Isn't the lab doing that?

30:05.074 --> 30:06.574
Theoretically, yes,
but... (Elevator bell dings)

30:06.575 --> 30:08.006
They're backlogged,

30:08.007 --> 30:12.581
and I don't think we'll
have it until tomorrow.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.844
It's odd.

30:15.845 --> 30:18.586
Initially, I thought
it was a paste.

30:18.587 --> 30:20.518
But now it seems
like it's sandings

30:20.519 --> 30:22.390
or filings from something.

30:22.391 --> 30:25.093
A little more work and a
little less talking, ladies.

30:25.094 --> 30:26.955
You feel me?

30:26.956 --> 30:28.456
(People speaking indistinctly)

30:28.457 --> 30:30.199
(Sputters)

30:34.163 --> 30:35.864
That's it.

30:35.865 --> 30:37.365
That's it!

30:37.366 --> 30:39.337
No more Mr. Nicey-nice.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.838
Heads are gon' roll.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.571
(Laughs)

30:44.013 --> 30:45.173
You. Don't look at me

30:45.174 --> 30:46.614
with those big,
dumb, sweet eyes.

30:46.615 --> 30:49.047
This has your name
written all over it.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.448
No, Curtis. You
gotta believe me.

30:50.449 --> 30:51.950
I had nothing to do with this.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.281
But big props to
whoever did, guys.

30:53.282 --> 30:54.923
This is awesome. (Laughter)

30:54.924 --> 30:56.354
I'll give you props
with my foot in your...

30:56.355 --> 30:58.226
Curtis, you don't even know
Ethan had anything to do...

30:58.227 --> 31:00.558
And I don't want you
undermining my authority, and...

31:00.559 --> 31:01.930
(Speaks indistinctly)

31:01.931 --> 31:04.092
What is he doing here?

31:04.093 --> 31:06.234
(Voice breaking)
They came for me.

31:06.235 --> 31:07.896
Child protective services,

31:07.897 --> 31:09.197
they said I can't stay
at Travis' anymore.

31:09.198 --> 31:10.538
That... that... that's nuts.

31:10.539 --> 31:11.869
Why do I have to go
to some foster home

31:11.870 --> 31:13.641
with a bunch of people
I don't even know?

31:13.642 --> 31:15.603
All right, Greg. Calm
down. You said you'd help!

31:15.604 --> 31:17.205
All right. Listen,
let's go in here

31:17.206 --> 31:18.446
and talk about it,
all right? (Groans)

31:18.447 --> 31:19.908
Are you all right?

31:19.909 --> 31:21.409
(Sniffles)

31:21.410 --> 31:22.650
Y-Yeah, I'm fine.

31:22.651 --> 31:24.983
Come on.

31:24.984 --> 31:26.554
Ow. Just please don't touch me.

31:26.555 --> 31:29.087
You are definitely not fine.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.359
What's going on?

31:35.364 --> 31:38.326
(Exhales deeply)

31:38.327 --> 31:39.668
(Sniffles)

31:42.972 --> 31:44.403
Who did this to you?

31:48.537 --> 31:50.940
My father.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.515
(Camera shutter clicking)

31:57.516 --> 31:59.187
Do we really have to do this?

31:59.188 --> 32:01.689
I told you I'd help
you, and I will.

32:01.690 --> 32:03.321
But you gotta trust me.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.224
Okay?

32:06.655 --> 32:09.598
I'll be right back. Promise.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.634
I want every Mark on
that kid documented.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.506
That is a hell of a beating.

32:18.507 --> 32:21.669
If his father did that,
that's motive for Greg.

32:21.670 --> 32:23.271
I don't even want
to think about that.

32:23.272 --> 32:24.712
You know bud's gonna
want to talk to him.

32:24.713 --> 32:26.944
I don't care what
bud's gonna want.

32:26.945 --> 32:29.177
Nobody's talking to him
till I can get him a lawyer.

32:29.178 --> 32:31.279
The kid's got no parents
to look out for his rights,

32:31.280 --> 32:32.621
so I'm stepping in.

32:52.041 --> 32:53.341
(People speaking indistinctly)

32:53.342 --> 32:54.472
Greg?

32:54.473 --> 32:56.474
(Elevator bell dings)

32:56.475 --> 32:58.206
You son of a bitch!

32:58.207 --> 32:59.707
How could you?!

32:59.708 --> 33:01.679
(Grunting)

33:01.680 --> 33:04.012
(All shouting at once)

33:04.013 --> 33:05.453
(Greg and Aaron grunting)

33:05.454 --> 33:06.554
Get him down to holding!

33:06.555 --> 33:08.616
(Curtis) Come here!

33:08.617 --> 33:10.018
Don't tell them anything.

33:10.019 --> 33:11.359
You hear me? Don't
say a word, Greg!

33:11.360 --> 33:12.591
No! Don't!

33:19.128 --> 33:20.428
What do you think Aaron
meant, "don't tell them anything"?

33:20.429 --> 33:22.430
I mean, they both suffered
the old man's abuse.

33:22.431 --> 33:24.302
So you think they
did it together?

33:24.303 --> 33:25.433
Ah, maybe.

33:25.434 --> 33:27.135
And by that, you mean maybe not.

33:27.136 --> 33:29.077
Do you care to tell me
what you're thinking?

33:29.078 --> 33:31.709
Curtis.

33:31.710 --> 33:36.784
I need to see the
photos of Greg's bruises.

33:36.785 --> 33:39.387
I'm not so much
interested in his bruises

33:39.388 --> 33:42.220
as the rash on his arm.

33:42.221 --> 33:44.492
You looking at Robyn Lux again?

33:44.493 --> 33:47.355
It's not Robyn.
It's her son Greg.

33:47.356 --> 33:49.427
Those are the same
wheals and flares

33:49.428 --> 33:50.399
I saw in Robyn's rash.

33:50.400 --> 33:51.629
That's contact urticaria.

33:51.630 --> 33:54.332
Well, urticaria is hereditary.

33:54.333 --> 33:56.734
That means that Greg had
the same allergic reaction

33:56.735 --> 33:58.266
as his mother.

33:58.267 --> 34:00.168
Wait a minute.
Greg isn't the killer,

34:00.169 --> 34:02.170
but he was touched
by the killer?

34:02.171 --> 34:03.441
(Peter) He's allergic
to lemon juice.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.414
Those photos were taken
before Greg saw Aaron,

34:06.415 --> 34:08.316
so Aaron didn't give him
the rash. (Door opens)

34:08.317 --> 34:09.777
(Ethan) Hey, am I interrupting?

34:09.778 --> 34:11.679
Whoa. Uh, hey, check this out.

34:11.680 --> 34:13.651
I think I identified
the substance

34:13.652 --> 34:15.453
in Mike Lux's neck wound.

34:15.454 --> 34:16.654
I-I was confused at first

34:16.655 --> 34:19.157
because it was
largely made up of talc,

34:19.158 --> 34:22.290
but there were also instances
of resin and pigment...

34:22.291 --> 34:24.632
Could you spit it out already?

34:24.633 --> 34:25.833
It's bondo.

34:25.834 --> 34:28.537
It's used to fill
in dents on cars.

34:33.502 --> 34:34.473
Travis.

34:34.474 --> 34:36.374
Do you have a few minutes?

34:36.375 --> 34:38.606
I have some questions
about the night

34:38.607 --> 34:39.707
the luxes died.

34:39.708 --> 34:41.749
Yeah, sure.

34:41.750 --> 34:44.212
I guess.

34:44.213 --> 34:45.513
Hey.

34:45.514 --> 34:47.185
(Objects clatter)

34:47.186 --> 34:48.386
Is there a problem?

34:48.387 --> 34:49.557
No.

34:49.558 --> 34:52.420
I just don't want anybody
messing with my stuff.

34:52.421 --> 34:55.523
Check it out.

34:55.524 --> 34:57.525
Grease cutter,
mostly lemon juice.

34:57.526 --> 34:59.727
Bud, look at this.

34:59.728 --> 35:01.330
Serrated blade.

35:11.740 --> 35:14.282
Everyone thought
they were so perfect.

35:14.283 --> 35:17.415
That's how they made it look.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.287
No one really knows.

35:19.288 --> 35:20.788
About the abuse?

35:20.789 --> 35:23.622
You try not to do
anything wrong, you know?

35:25.454 --> 35:28.656
You try to be perfect
so they won't get mad.

35:28.657 --> 35:32.361
And then sometimes,
they just... snap.

35:33.562 --> 35:36.635
You were abused,
too, weren't you?

35:38.607 --> 35:40.409
Who was it, your father?

35:42.241 --> 35:44.612
I was used to seeing
the marks on Greg.

35:44.613 --> 35:47.615
He told me to just let it go.

35:47.616 --> 35:51.320
But this last time, his dad...

35:53.252 --> 35:56.484
Went off like he was crazy.

35:56.485 --> 35:59.527
He just kept hitting
Greg with this hose

35:59.528 --> 36:03.531
over and over.

36:03.532 --> 36:05.663
(Exhales deeply)
He wouldn't stop.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.665
You were there?

36:07.666 --> 36:10.638
You saw it happen?

36:10.639 --> 36:13.601
I was right outside the door.

36:13.602 --> 36:16.544
I froze.

36:16.545 --> 36:19.508
I didn't stop it.

36:20.879 --> 36:22.680
But I stopped it now.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.682
Why didn't you
just tell someone?

36:24.683 --> 36:26.684
Who?

36:26.685 --> 36:29.957
Nobody cares.

36:29.958 --> 36:32.521
Nobody does anything.

36:35.724 --> 36:38.697
I had to do this to save Greg.

36:41.830 --> 36:46.804
I never meant to hurt Mrs. Lux.

36:46.805 --> 36:49.278
It was just supposed to be him.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.681
(Sniffles)

36:53.682 --> 36:57.285
I thought I could save them.

36:57.286 --> 36:58.916
(Morris) Come
on, Travis. Let's...

36:58.917 --> 37:00.589
Go talk to your mother.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.353
(Sniffles)

37:08.727 --> 37:10.998
Tell Greg I'm sorry.

37:10.999 --> 37:13.761
Will you?

37:13.762 --> 37:15.464
For me?

37:25.514 --> 37:27.915
(Sniffles)

37:27.916 --> 37:30.918
She just...

37:30.919 --> 37:33.582
She looks like she's asleep.

37:35.724 --> 37:38.327
I keep thinking I
could wake her.

37:41.990 --> 37:43.991
(Crying) I got nobody now.

37:43.992 --> 37:47.735
She's gone, and...
and... and Travis.

37:47.736 --> 37:49.497
(Sniffles)

37:49.498 --> 37:50.798
What am I gonna do?

37:50.799 --> 37:55.304
Maybe you're not
as alone as you think.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.556
(Sniffles)

38:09.988 --> 38:12.320
Greg, come on.

38:12.321 --> 38:14.292
Look at me.

38:16.325 --> 38:17.665
You should've been there.

38:17.666 --> 38:19.667
I wanted to.

38:19.668 --> 38:21.769
I just didn't know how.

38:21.770 --> 38:25.673
But I'm here now, Greg.

38:25.674 --> 38:27.874
And I'm never gonna leave
you again. I promise you that.

38:29.638 --> 38:32.740
We've got each other,
and we'll be a family now.

38:32.741 --> 38:34.612
That's what mom would've wanted.

38:34.613 --> 38:37.616
(Both crying)

38:49.097 --> 38:51.529
You know, you
impressed me, you know?

38:51.530 --> 38:53.761
The way you handled this.

38:53.762 --> 38:56.964
You really stepped up.

38:56.965 --> 39:00.738
Maybe you're not such
a bad chief after all.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.710
Thank you.

39:02.711 --> 39:04.813
That means something.

39:06.014 --> 39:08.015
Too bad the practical
jokers in the office

39:08.016 --> 39:10.918
don't feel your sentiments.

39:10.919 --> 39:12.480
Uh... (Clears throat)

39:12.481 --> 39:15.022
Actually, they, uh, they do.

39:15.023 --> 39:17.886
And I'm not
saying I did it, but...

39:19.728 --> 39:22.059
Okay, I am saying
it. I did it. I did...

39:22.060 --> 39:23.761
All of it...

39:23.762 --> 39:26.063
The delivery, the office.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.065
Why would you...

39:28.066 --> 39:29.898
I wasn't that bad, was I?

39:31.840 --> 39:33.741
(Clears throat)

39:33.742 --> 39:35.544
(Laughs)

39:37.876 --> 39:40.778
You do know it's
on now, don't you?

39:40.779 --> 39:42.009
(Laughs)

39:42.010 --> 39:44.381
All right. (Laughs)

39:44.382 --> 39:47.385
(Men speaking indistinctly)

39:56.825 --> 39:59.396
Okay. Yeah.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.569
You were right.

40:01.830 --> 40:03.501
What am I right about?

40:03.502 --> 40:04.832
(Clicks tongue)

40:04.833 --> 40:05.933
I'm terrified.

40:05.934 --> 40:07.635
Of what?

40:07.636 --> 40:09.937
What do you think?

40:09.938 --> 40:12.940
O-Of... of being
vulnerable, o-of getting hurt.

40:12.941 --> 40:15.112
And then there's
the age difference.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.945
Let's stop pretending
it doesn't matter.

40:17.946 --> 40:20.518
I happen to like older women.

40:20.519 --> 40:21.819
Right. You say that
now because you think

40:21.820 --> 40:23.821
that I'm strong and independent.

40:23.822 --> 40:27.825
Just wait till you find
out who I really am.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.827
And then there's Lacey

40:29.828 --> 40:31.529
and my job, and I
know you thought

40:31.530 --> 40:33.130
that I was just using
it as an excuse before,

40:33.131 --> 40:35.633
but it really doesn't leave me much
