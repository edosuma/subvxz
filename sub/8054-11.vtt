00:01.835 --> 00:03.589
- What's up?
- I'm gonna need you to go up

00:03.714 --> 00:06.088
to the bureau of motor vehicles
on the fourth floor.

00:06.367 --> 00:08.799
We got to talk ourselves out
of this late registration fee

00:08.967 --> 00:10.176
for the parks van.

00:10.454 --> 00:12.388
Come on. I don't want to go
to the fourth floor.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.714
That is the creepiest place
on earth.

00:14.839 --> 00:16.658
The fourth floor is awful...

00:17.194 --> 00:19.376
The DMV, divorce filings,

00:19.501 --> 00:20.901
probation offices.

00:22.436 --> 00:25.313
They put a popcorn machine up there
just to brighten things up,

00:25.489 --> 00:26.995
but they used the wrong kind of oil

00:27.120 --> 00:29.487
and a bunch of people
had to get their throats replaced.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.856
They'll only talk to you or me,

00:31.981 --> 00:33.231
and I can't go.

00:33.481 --> 00:34.700
Because I don't want to.

Hey, boo, you're pretty.

00:58.037 --> 00:59.287
Thank you, sir.

00:59.789 --> 01:01.123
Are you on probation?

01:01.248 --> 01:03.556
I got clean urine.
You need female, I got female.

01:03.681 --> 01:06.456
- I'm good. Thank you.
- Hey, you clean? I buy too.

01:26.710 --> 01:27.909
Tom and Wendy?

01:28.657 --> 01:29.657
Popcorn?

lestat78

01:52.994 --> 01:54.768
So, Tom...

01:54.893 --> 01:57.657
how's everything in your life,
generally?

01:58.035 --> 01:58.968
Amazing.

01:59.093 --> 02:01.564
Took a risk,
bought some shoes online.

02:02.837 --> 02:05.137
Paid off handsomely, as you can see.

02:07.967 --> 02:11.065
And how are your institutions

02:11.593 --> 02:12.882
that you're a part of?

02:13.695 --> 02:16.692
- You heard about my divorce?
- I saw you on the fourth floor.

02:16.817 --> 02:18.763
I'm so, so sorry.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.431
Honestly, it's fine.

02:21.123 --> 02:24.310
Lasted longer than Avril Lavigne
and the guy from Sum 41. Am I right?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.500
I don't know what those are.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.500
Look...

02:28.649 --> 02:29.731
stop working.

02:30.753 --> 02:33.474
- Would have been nice to have saved it.
- You should have auto-saved that.

02:33.599 --> 02:35.418
That kind of feels like your fault.

02:36.105 --> 02:38.717
Look, I've heard your voice
when she calls you on the phone.

02:38.842 --> 02:41.463
I've seen you look at her ass
when she leaves the room.

02:41.588 --> 02:42.703
You love her.

02:43.024 --> 02:45.094
I really appreciate
what you're trying to do,

02:45.219 --> 02:46.369
but I'm fine.

02:46.517 --> 02:48.867
Look. Look at my face.
Are you watching?

02:50.993 --> 02:52.296
I did a little research,

02:52.510 --> 02:55.290
and divorce is the number two

02:55.415 --> 02:57.760
most stressful event
in a person's life.

02:58.124 --> 03:00.424
Of course marriage is number seven.

03:00.870 --> 03:02.930
So watch out, everyone.

03:03.928 --> 03:05.078
It's all bad.

03:07.922 --> 03:10.272
We have to step up.
For Tom's sake.

03:10.479 --> 03:12.038
I think Tom seems fine.

03:12.163 --> 03:13.848
Well, that is the problem.

03:13.973 --> 03:16.409
Tom always seems like
Mr. Slickster cool guy,

03:16.534 --> 03:18.031
but he's hiding his emotions

03:18.156 --> 03:20.407
underneath a very thick layer
of axe body spray.

03:21.103 --> 03:22.273
We have to help him.

03:22.398 --> 03:24.954
- We are his safe bubble.
- She's kind of right.

03:25.256 --> 03:26.891
None of his family lives here,

03:27.016 --> 03:29.208
and all of his friends
are frat guys and morons.

03:29.593 --> 03:31.502
This seems like
none of our business.

03:31.763 --> 03:32.920
Be supportive, okay?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.423
Don't be all like,

03:35.447 --> 03:36.749
"I don't want to.

03:36.874 --> 03:37.967
"I am a guy,

03:38.135 --> 03:39.260
"and I like fire

03:39.495 --> 03:42.054
"and playing hockey and eating meat.

03:42.179 --> 03:44.533
"No, no, says I."

03:45.839 --> 03:48.269
- That was a really good Ron.
- Thank you.

03:48.481 --> 03:50.791
- I don't know how to explain...
- Hey, Mark.

03:50.916 --> 03:53.660
The shoeshine stand still doesn't have
that syphilis medication

03:53.785 --> 03:55.385
you were asking about.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.113
What a coincidence.

03:59.578 --> 04:01.574
Are you in this office

04:01.742 --> 04:03.519
purely for business reasons?

04:03.644 --> 04:05.094
Pleasure, actually.

04:05.267 --> 04:07.367
My boyfriend, Mark, works here.

04:07.492 --> 04:09.540
- He's sitting right next to me.
- Hey, Andy.

04:10.008 --> 04:12.771
What a surprise running into you
all day every day

04:12.896 --> 04:14.420
every single place that we are.

04:14.878 --> 04:15.878
Likewise.

04:16.373 --> 04:18.673
Well, I guess
I'll see you guys around.

04:18.841 --> 04:19.918
See ya.

04:20.684 --> 04:22.342
Also, Mark, again,

04:22.467 --> 04:25.556
we don't have those extra-small
condoms you ordered.

04:26.145 --> 04:29.042
I called the factory.
It's gonna take a special order.

04:29.167 --> 04:32.972
Not just because of the size,
but because of the weird shape as well.

04:33.097 --> 04:35.691
Something they've never
dealt with before. We'll talk.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.650
Mark never asked me for any small,
weirdly-shaped condoms.

04:38.775 --> 04:40.025
I made that up.

04:41.148 --> 04:44.248
Every day I subtly chip away
at their relationship,

04:44.657 --> 04:46.535
weakening it little by little.

04:50.066 --> 04:53.541
Where's Tom Haverford?

04:56.124 --> 04:57.421
For ******** sake.

04:57.682 --> 05:00.117
<i>So you had a divorce</i>

05:00.242 --> 05:01.364
<i>Of course of course</i>

05:01.489 --> 05:03.636
<i>And no one enjoys
a divorce of course</i>

05:03.804 --> 05:06.388
I don't know what to do.
I can't be like, "Hey, Leslie,

05:06.818 --> 05:08.599
it's a green-card marriage.
I'm fine."

05:08.767 --> 05:10.599
Leslie thinks
you're a wounded animal,

05:10.724 --> 05:12.937
so her female instincts
are kicking in.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.593
Here's what you do.

05:14.718 --> 05:15.648
Act sad.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.336
Let her pull the thorn out of your paw
and wrap a bandage around it.

05:19.461 --> 05:22.071
That'll make her feel better.
She'll get off your jock.

05:22.356 --> 05:25.305
You still can't tell anyone
about the green card thing.

05:25.450 --> 05:28.010
Apparently you can get in trouble
even after divorce.

05:28.135 --> 05:29.226
Damn the man.

05:29.351 --> 05:30.871
Your secret's safe with me.

05:31.255 --> 05:32.623
Thanks, Rondoleezza Rice.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.216
Okay, everyone...

05:34.341 --> 05:36.913
The rumors are true.
Wendy and I are splitting up.

05:37.466 --> 05:38.796
Yeah, I'm really hurt.

05:39.129 --> 05:41.590
I'm so sorry
you feel that way, little friend.

05:42.130 --> 05:44.837
Why don't we go out tonight,
hit the town after work, huh?

05:44.962 --> 05:47.763
We'll make it Tom's night.
You can go anywhere you want. Our treat.

05:48.601 --> 05:50.660
There's a really fun documentary

05:50.785 --> 05:53.285
about tandem bicycles
at the art house.

05:54.217 --> 05:56.313
Supposed to be pretty unapologetic.

05:56.735 --> 05:58.962
- Or we could go to a restaurant.
- Strip club?

05:59.087 --> 06:00.816
- Did somebody say strip club?
- No.

06:00.941 --> 06:02.541
- Somebody say strip club?
- You did.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.702
I definitely heard
someone say strip club.

06:04.827 --> 06:06.511
- You did.
- Would the glitter factory

06:06.636 --> 06:08.534
be okay with whoever
suggested strip club?

06:08.702 --> 06:10.379
I don't think that's a good idea.

06:10.504 --> 06:13.998
There is a great
dinosaur-themed restaurant in Patterson.

06:14.123 --> 06:15.666
It is called Jurassic Fork.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.337
I have gone there three times a week
for the last 15 years.

06:20.844 --> 06:22.420
Dinosaurs, huh?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.648
All right.
Sounds okay.

06:24.773 --> 06:26.626
Okay! It's gonna be
a crazy night, guys.

06:26.751 --> 06:28.220
I will see you at Jurassic Fork

06:28.388 --> 06:29.538
at 5:45 p. M.

06:33.184 --> 06:35.180
Hi, welcome to Jurassic Fork

06:35.305 --> 06:37.903
where the only thing that'll be extinct
is your appetite.

06:38.801 --> 06:40.424
- You ready to order?
- Yes.

06:40.549 --> 06:43.599
I will have the Jamaican
jerk chicken veloci-wrap.

06:44.122 --> 06:46.238
I'm gonna get the tricera-chops,
please.

06:46.444 --> 06:48.221
How do you want that cooked?

06:48.346 --> 06:49.867
Medium roar.

06:51.341 --> 06:52.441
Medium rare?

06:52.566 --> 06:53.866
No, medium roar.

06:54.613 --> 06:58.167
For legal reasons, wecan't make puns
about the temperature of the meats.

06:58.456 --> 07:00.906
I'll have the surf and turf-osaurus,

07:01.390 --> 07:03.540
and a couple of bottles of wine?

07:04.071 --> 07:06.467
I'm gonna need a lot of wine,
so keep it flowing.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.376
I'm not gonna be drinking anything.

07:08.501 --> 07:10.429
Just wanted everybody to know that.

07:10.632 --> 07:12.247
I'm not a big fan of group dinners

07:12.372 --> 07:15.387
where everybody splits the bill
no matter what they get.

07:15.512 --> 07:19.021
I ordered a tyranno-ceasar salad,
and that's all I'm paying for.

07:20.984 --> 07:22.384
Hey, check it out.

07:22.509 --> 07:23.742
They got pool.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.098
You want to play?

07:26.223 --> 07:29.406
Finally settle that debate
about who's the better pool player.

07:29.845 --> 07:31.658
I've never had
that debate with anyone.

07:31.995 --> 07:33.692
We'll put a little money on it.

07:33.817 --> 07:35.704
- Make it a little more interesting.
- Please.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.756
No, I figured
because pool is all about angles,

07:37.881 --> 07:40.638
and he's a failed architect,
that he might want to play pool.

07:40.763 --> 07:43.074
- Let's do it.
- Really? That worked?

07:43.666 --> 07:46.173
How to hustle somebody in pool
by Andy Dwyer.

07:46.505 --> 07:48.312
Step 1, find the person
you want to hustle.

07:48.437 --> 07:49.874
Invite them to play pool.

07:49.999 --> 07:51.449
Should they accept,

07:51.809 --> 07:52.809
you're in.

07:53.488 --> 07:55.849
Here's what I think we should do.
Everyone should go around

07:56.017 --> 07:58.112
and say one thing
that they love about Tom.

07:58.237 --> 07:59.237
I'll start.

07:59.504 --> 08:01.855
- I really wish I could have your body.
- What?

08:02.523 --> 08:04.725
Like, tied up, naked,
in your basement?

08:05.026 --> 08:08.362
No, I mean, you're in good shape,
and you can eat whatever you want.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.030
Well, that was weird, Jerry.

08:10.474 --> 08:11.589
Ann, you go ahead.

08:11.714 --> 08:13.524
I think Tom is really nice.

08:13.649 --> 08:15.332
Also, you can give me
your credit cards,

08:15.457 --> 08:17.788
- I'll divide it up. I don't mind.
- Don't worry about it.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.415
The restaurant'll divide it evenly.
Just enjoy yourself.

08:20.969 --> 08:22.262
April, go ahead.

08:23.196 --> 08:25.087
Tom is the only cool person
in the office.

08:27.025 --> 08:28.132
Ridiculous. Donna?

08:28.313 --> 08:31.051
I love you, Tom.
You're my little prince.

08:31.371 --> 08:33.928
Just want to put you
in a little cape and a little hat

08:34.053 --> 08:35.753
and just fly you around.

08:36.342 --> 08:37.432
Thank you, Donna.

08:38.294 --> 08:39.395
Hey, garcon?

08:40.102 --> 08:41.604
I'm still feeling pretty sad.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.008
Can I get two creme brulees

08:44.133 --> 08:46.692
and another glass
of "bronto" grigio?

08:47.095 --> 08:49.218
I thought I had Tom all figured out,

08:49.571 --> 08:52.043
but it's almost like
he's faking being sad.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.824
Why would he do that?

08:56.892 --> 08:58.192
And that's game.

08:58.638 --> 09:00.488
I think you now owe me $25.

09:00.832 --> 09:01.762
Shoot.

09:02.135 --> 09:04.068
Someone had a pool table
growing up, huh?

09:04.193 --> 09:05.754
What do you say we play again?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.552
We'll make it a little more interesting.
Go double or nothing?

09:09.308 --> 09:10.308
Why not?

09:11.119 --> 09:11.967
Step two,

09:12.668 --> 09:15.977
lose to your opponent intentionally,
so they gain confidence.

09:16.658 --> 09:18.396
Step two has been completed.

09:18.679 --> 09:19.558
Easily.

09:20.281 --> 09:21.381
Very easily.

09:21.846 --> 09:23.746
Mark is pretty good at pool.

09:25.034 --> 09:26.934
So how are you feeling, Tom?

09:27.059 --> 09:28.770
Are you feeling okay?

09:28.895 --> 09:30.558
I like pretending to be sad.

09:30.683 --> 09:32.029
I now see why girls do it.

09:32.649 --> 09:34.518
So your arrangement with Wendy,

09:34.643 --> 09:36.890
it really was completely platonic?

09:37.427 --> 09:39.461
Yeah, never so much as even kissed.

09:39.690 --> 09:42.372
Except for a little peck at the wedding
for appearances.

09:43.192 --> 09:45.066
Now that you're getting divorced,

09:45.191 --> 09:46.791
I sort of feel like...

09:47.402 --> 09:50.297
there may be some potential
with me and Wendy.

09:51.555 --> 09:54.301
Would it be okay with you
if I was to ask her out

09:54.426 --> 09:56.276
once the fake dust settles?

09:58.928 --> 09:59.932
Why not?
Sure.

10:00.541 --> 10:02.863
Looking at her, I... I feel like...

10:03.254 --> 10:05.836
She might be the perfect
spooning size for me.

10:06.307 --> 10:07.814
I'm gonna take a leak.

10:16.202 --> 10:18.263
That would be $6,400.

10:19.448 --> 10:21.954
I accept checks
and most major credit cards.

10:23.504 --> 10:25.813
Mark is way better than me.
I'm gonna...

10:25.938 --> 10:28.463
I'm gonna say
that there is at least...

10:28.738 --> 10:29.788
a chance...

10:30.930 --> 10:33.680
that I didn't think
this through completely.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.051
I think I'm done, Andy.

10:36.834 --> 10:40.149
Forget money.
We'll play for something else.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.834
- You have nothing else to give me.
- A t-shirt I tackled Eddie Vedder in.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.269
It's literally priceless.

10:45.437 --> 10:46.958
Okay, how about this.

10:47.237 --> 10:50.691
If you win, you don't owe me any money,
but if I win, stop bugging me and Ann.

10:51.134 --> 10:53.353
- What are you talking about?
- No more comments.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.328
No more showing up
when we're hanging out.

10:55.453 --> 10:56.829
You leave us alone.

10:56.954 --> 10:59.454
That doesn't seem
like a very fair bet.

11:01.068 --> 11:02.427
So if I win,

11:02.820 --> 11:04.162
I also get Ann.

11:04.911 --> 11:05.822
Okay, fine.

11:05.947 --> 11:08.291
If you win, then you get Ann.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.197
Rack 'em up.

11:10.322 --> 11:11.920
Somebody punch someone.

11:12.916 --> 11:14.486
So how you doing, buddy?

11:14.611 --> 11:16.550
Want some steak? Champagne?

11:16.718 --> 11:19.037
Think of something
and we'll get it. What do you want?

11:19.162 --> 11:20.262
A cheese fountain?

11:20.814 --> 11:21.722
A ruby?

11:23.226 --> 11:24.725
A goose heart?

11:25.138 --> 11:27.647
How about a marriage?
How about a non-divorce?

11:28.605 --> 11:30.770
I'm sorry.
Maybe you need some time apart,

11:30.895 --> 11:32.816
to remember
how much you care about each other.

11:33.470 --> 11:35.944
Think about it. Does our marriage
really make sense to you?

11:36.448 --> 11:38.739
She's a tall, beautiful surgeon.

11:38.907 --> 11:41.658
I'm a short,
beautiful government employee

11:41.783 --> 11:43.243
slash club promoter.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.703
You're a club promoter?

11:44.871 --> 11:45.871
Aspiring.

11:47.558 --> 11:50.308
The point is,
I never meant anything to her.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.377
It wasn't even a real marriage.

11:53.002 --> 11:55.452
Now the sadness
is pouring out of Tom.

11:55.794 --> 11:59.301
Like blood from a pterodactyl
after it's attacked by a T-Rex.

11:59.602 --> 12:03.202
I have to take him to a place
where he can't possibly be sad.

12:07.319 --> 12:08.212
Crap.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.563
- We are going to the Glitter Factory.
- What?

12:11.871 --> 12:14.304
I can't go back there.
But if you see Jasmine,

12:14.429 --> 12:17.235
tell her she can keep Anthony,
but I want my microwave back.

12:18.385 --> 12:20.322
Good.
You're gonna take April home.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.449
No, I want to go
to the Glitter Factory.

12:22.617 --> 12:24.701
Drop out of school
and start doing meth.

12:25.066 --> 12:26.566
Let's go, everybody.

12:28.316 --> 12:30.082
I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

12:30.250 --> 12:31.541
but once you go in there,

12:31.709 --> 12:33.964
you will see things
you cannot un-see.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.710
I'm a feminist. I would never,
ever go to a strip club.

12:36.835 --> 12:39.599
I've gone on record
that if I had to have a stripper's name,

12:39.724 --> 12:41.274
it would be Equality.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.720
But I'm willing to sacrifice
all that I've worked for

12:43.888 --> 12:47.140
just to put a smile on your perverted
little face. So don't blow this.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.521
- All right.
- Lap dances are on me.

12:49.646 --> 12:52.668
I mean, I'm paying for them.
They're not gonna actually be on me.

12:52.793 --> 12:53.605
Got it.

12:53.919 --> 12:56.668
I kind of feel like Jane Goodall
studying the chimps.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.610
'Cause there are
some feminist scholars

12:58.778 --> 13:01.279
who say that stripping
is a feminist act.

13:10.643 --> 13:13.522
There is a girl here
that also works at Quiznos.

13:13.647 --> 13:15.085
She's really nice to me here

13:15.253 --> 13:17.390
but really mean to me at Quiznos.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.967
Go put these in places
I do not approve of.

13:22.582 --> 13:25.347
I'm gonna put these in places
you've never heard of.

13:26.089 --> 13:27.998
Yeah, I've been a little down.

13:28.123 --> 13:30.573
Totally natural.
I'm getting divorced.

13:30.986 --> 13:34.229
But now I'm ready to pull myself up
by some g-strings.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.857
It's rough in here.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.006
- Is it always like this?
- I wouldn't know.

13:39.131 --> 13:40.781
Don't like strip clubs.

13:41.002 --> 13:42.612
Smells like a wet mop in here.

13:43.061 --> 13:46.408
And I get the feeling that these women
is running a low-grade fever.

13:47.163 --> 13:48.577
You're one of the good ones.

13:49.291 --> 13:50.491
Wait a minute.

13:51.432 --> 13:52.782
Hello, beautiful.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.251
Strippers do nothing for me.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.514
I like a strong, salt of the earth,

13:58.639 --> 14:01.085
self-possessed woman
at the top of her field,

14:01.210 --> 14:03.008
your Steffi Grafs,
your Sheryl Swoopes.

14:04.390 --> 14:06.873
But I will take
a free breakfast buffet

14:07.262 --> 14:09.264
any time, any place.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.190
Tom cat.
Pull up a mouth.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.317
This buffet is unstoppable.

14:20.790 --> 14:22.040
I'm not hungry.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.946
You're doing a bang-up job
of looking sad about Wendy.

14:27.425 --> 14:28.783
Does she make scrambled eggs?

14:31.609 --> 14:32.788
Take it down a notch.

14:33.341 --> 14:35.859
You already won your Oscar,
DiCaprio.

14:40.926 --> 14:43.089
Ann, in case I don't sink this,

14:43.257 --> 14:45.449
it's been a real pleasure
dating you.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.807
Scratch on the eight!

14:55.206 --> 14:56.228
I'm victorious.

14:56.713 --> 14:59.550
I'm awesome at pool,
and I hustled your ass.

15:01.913 --> 15:03.276
Take a moment to say good-bye.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.988
I don't even know how to say this.
I am so sorry,

15:07.156 --> 15:09.691
and I will do my best
to visit you on holidays.

15:10.470 --> 15:11.618
Thanks. You tried.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.245
I guess you're his now.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.705
- Do you want to get out of here?
- I do.

15:16.018 --> 15:17.119
Bye, Andy.

15:17.347 --> 15:19.000
I know that legally

15:20.113 --> 15:22.127
Ann is now mine,

15:22.653 --> 15:25.867
but,
it weirdly doesn't feel that way.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.388
- This is Seabiscuit.
- Sierra.

15:31.846 --> 15:33.223
Sorry, it's loud in here.

15:33.391 --> 15:36.851
And I gave her money
to writhe around on your parts.

15:37.205 --> 15:38.395
I don't want to do that.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.265
Well, I already paid her.
Can I get my money back?

15:41.390 --> 15:42.774
So let her do her writhing.

15:43.966 --> 15:46.903
I just got to say, Sierra,
I don't get why this cheers men up,

15:47.071 --> 15:48.864
because it's very insincere
and fleeting,

15:49.032 --> 15:51.649
but go crazy.
Give my friend here the works.

15:51.774 --> 15:54.062
- Really grind the sorrow out of him.
- You got it.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.538
And then afterwards,
reconsider your profession, but for now,

15:57.006 --> 15:58.056
grind away.

16:03.254 --> 16:05.190
Stripper dancing action.

16:08.043 --> 16:09.593
I don't want to do this.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.721
Is it because you have a strong,
positive, female figure watching you?

16:13.027 --> 16:14.723
No, it's because I'm miserable.

16:15.698 --> 16:18.560
Never mind.
Thank you, Seabiscuit. That'll be all.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.026
I don't know what's wrong with me.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.987
This is honestly
the saddest I've ever been.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.280
Glitter bomb!

16:40.976 --> 16:44.306
I've been to the Glitter Factory
a million times.

16:44.962 --> 16:46.087
That girl up there,

16:46.404 --> 16:48.006
she's my emergency contact.

16:49.045 --> 16:50.247
But right now,

16:50.372 --> 16:51.622
I hate it here.

16:52.247 --> 16:54.012
And I just want to see Wendy.

16:54.710 --> 16:58.145
It's perfectly normal to feel devastated
when something's over.

16:58.270 --> 17:01.269
It's exactly how I felt
when that planet earth series ended.

17:01.645 --> 17:02.645
60 days!

17:03.340 --> 17:05.397
And then she's free
to marry Ron Swanson.

17:06.469 --> 17:07.483
What? Ron?

17:07.858 --> 17:09.736
He's gonna ask her out.
He told me.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.112
But who cares?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.130
If it's not him,
it'll just be some other guy.

17:18.548 --> 17:20.829
Did you tell Tom
that you were gonna ask out Wendy?

17:21.782 --> 17:22.790
It's complicated.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.550
What is wrong with you?

17:24.675 --> 17:27.098
I wish I wasn't alive
to hear myself say this,

17:27.223 --> 17:28.697
but I am ashamed

17:29.507 --> 17:31.883
to be your deputy.
I don't get men.

17:32.235 --> 17:34.398
If they're not wagering
their girlfriends in pool,

17:34.523 --> 17:36.832
then they're trying to steal
each other's wives.

17:36.957 --> 17:40.288
It makes you question the whole notion
of those bromance movies.

17:44.079 --> 17:45.313
Great.
Good. Okay.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.491
Could you carry him out of here?

17:47.616 --> 17:50.219
And, you know, also maybe
not have sex with his wife?

17:50.344 --> 17:51.344
Thanks.

17:53.209 --> 17:54.295
From the knees.

17:54.420 --> 17:56.163
He weighs eight pounds.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.582
We took Tom out tonight,
and he had a bit too much to drink.

18:08.239 --> 18:09.289
Come on in.

18:13.212 --> 18:14.212
My God.

18:14.337 --> 18:16.344
You insensitive little hussy.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.440
Excuse me?

18:18.966 --> 18:19.683
Halt.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.517
You're not divorced yet
and you're inviting other men over?

18:23.273 --> 18:24.227
You're married?

18:25.504 --> 18:27.067
Technically, yeah.

18:27.881 --> 18:29.190
That's my husband.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.483
Who's he carrying?

18:30.651 --> 18:32.360
No. That's his boss.

18:32.788 --> 18:35.362
My husband's the one that's
being carried.

18:35.487 --> 18:36.573
By his boss.

18:36.929 --> 18:38.173
How's it going?

18:38.298 --> 18:39.024
Good.

18:39.149 --> 18:40.326
You know what?

18:40.494 --> 18:42.664
You and Ron will be perfect
for each other.

18:42.789 --> 18:46.777
You should get married and start a club
for people who betray Tom Haverford.

18:49.431 --> 18:50.920
You have a lovely home.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.300
So where do you want this?

18:57.203 --> 18:58.344
So how you feeling?

18:59.162 --> 19:00.096
Rough morning?

19:00.264 --> 19:03.314
You know those hangover pills
you can order on TV?

19:03.439 --> 19:06.077
I threw up a bunch of them this morning
and feel much better.

19:06.202 --> 19:07.645
Last night was really rough,

19:07.813 --> 19:10.065
but all I want for you
is to get over this.

19:10.447 --> 19:11.900
I need to tell you something.

19:13.628 --> 19:16.492
The reason
I was acting weird yesterday was,

19:16.617 --> 19:19.117
Wendy and I have
a green-card marriage.

19:21.137 --> 19:22.619
My God, because you're Libyan.

19:23.234 --> 19:24.954
No, damn it.
Wendy's from Canada.

19:28.285 --> 19:29.375
Wait. Start again?

19:31.360 --> 19:32.276
This...

19:35.088 --> 19:37.133
You guys got a second?
It's about last night.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.929
I hope I'm not gonna have
to explain to you that you don't own me.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.084
Of course not.

19:42.209 --> 19:44.808
I never for one second
thought that that was for real.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.871
You don't have to worry
about me bothering you anymore.

19:49.996 --> 19:51.955
You clearly have something going,

19:52.080 --> 19:53.650
and I should respect that.

19:55.737 --> 19:57.904
If you say "psych",
I'm gonna be really pissed.

19:58.612 --> 20:01.167
You remembered how much I like
to say "psych".

20:02.038 --> 20:04.493
But no, this is no "psych".

20:06.531 --> 20:08.581
Thank you
for saying all that just now.

20:09.095 --> 20:09.965
Sure.

20:11.157 --> 20:12.833
Goodbye, A-cakes.

20:13.300 --> 20:14.514
Hello, Ann.

20:15.516 --> 20:17.203
Good-bye, Ann.

20:18.610 --> 20:19.551
Good-bye, Andy.

20:26.136 --> 20:29.561
I thought for a second you were gonna
chase after me, but you didn't.

20:29.883 --> 20:31.354
I meant every word I said.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.776
You like your wife?
That's a bummer.

20:37.358 --> 20:40.780
Anyone knows that you like your wife?
Your wife knows that you like your wife?

20:41.111 --> 20:43.111
I didn't know until yesterday.

20:43.372 --> 20:45.305
So don't tell anyone.
Don't tell Ron.

20:45.430 --> 20:46.452
It's my problem.

20:49.141 --> 20:51.499
How could there possibly
still be glitter on me?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.349
Takes forever to get off.

20:53.474 --> 20:55.628
My crotch looks like a disco ball.

21:11.469 --> 21:13.271
<i>Sorry she called you selfish
of course</i>

21:13.491 --> 21:15.648
<i>She just didn't know
the full story of course</i>

21:15.816 --> 21:18.574
<i>But now that she does
she's sorry of course</i>

21:19.445 --> 21:21.154
<i>She loves being your deputy</i>
