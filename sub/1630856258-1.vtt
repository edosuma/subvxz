Hi.

03:34.634 --> 03:36.406
I'm Terry West.
What's your name?

03:37.975 --> 03:39.135
Priscilla Beaulieu.

03:39.237 --> 03:42.710
I see you come in here a lot.
Is your family stationed here?

03:42.812 --> 03:44.143
Yes.

03:44.245 --> 03:45.846
Where are you from?

03:45.949 --> 03:47.645
Uh, Texas.

03:47.747 --> 03:50.387
My dad just transferred here
in August.

03:50.854 --> 03:52.219
That so?

03:52.321 --> 03:53.951
Well, how do you like Germany?

03:54.857 --> 03:56.020
Mmm.

03:56.122 --> 03:59.792
I book the entertainment here.
My wife plays here sometimes.

04:00.765 --> 04:02.228
Neat.

04:02.330 --> 04:04.128
Do you like Elvis Presley?

04:06.202 --> 04:08.234
Of course. Who doesn't?

04:08.336 --> 04:09.703
Well, I'm a friend of his.

04:09.805 --> 04:11.935
My wife and I go to his house
when he has people over.

04:12.037 --> 04:14.607
He's always glad to see
folks from back home.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.578
We're going this weekend,
if you want to join.

04:21.217 --> 04:22.818
Have to ask my parents.

04:22.920 --> 04:24.047

04:50.615 --> 04:53.410
You wanna go with strangers
to Elvis Presley's house?

04:53.512 --> 04:55.251
Absolutely not.

04:55.353 --> 04:57.113
There'd be other people
there too.

04:58.652 --> 05:01.024
It's the weekend,
why can't I go?

05:01.127 --> 05:02.523
I'd be with Terry and his wife.

05:02.625 --> 05:04.626
- We don't know them.
- Who are these people?

05:05.763 --> 05:06.892
No.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.129
There's nothing
to do here.

05:19.277 --> 05:22.212
Hello, Captain.
I'm Terry West.

05:22.314 --> 05:24.379
Good to meet you.
This is my wife, Ann.

05:24.481 --> 05:26.613
- Hello.
- Hi. I book the music here.

05:26.716 --> 05:29.145
My wife Carol and I
are friends with Elvis.

05:29.247 --> 05:31.747
He's having people over.
Your daughter's welcome to come.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.754
She said I'd have to ask you.

05:34.221 --> 05:35.558
I see.

05:36.391 --> 05:37.524
What unit are you in?

05:37.626 --> 05:39.359
Stationed under
Sergeant Bryant, sir.

05:39.461 --> 05:41.030
- Bryant, huh?
- Yes, sir.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.794
Still tough as nails?

05:42.897 --> 05:45.431
Yes, sir.
If you have any tips...

05:45.533 --> 05:47.237
No, there's no shortcuts, son.

05:47.339 --> 05:49.038
Well, your daughter'd be
well chaperoned

05:49.140 --> 05:50.200
by my wife and myself.

05:50.302 --> 05:52.474
The house is just off base.
I could pick her up at 8:30

05:52.576 --> 05:54.944
and have her back
by any time you say, sir.

05:55.046 --> 05:56.172
We'll discuss it.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.785
That one's pretty.

06:06.887 --> 06:09.493
It's my Easter dress,
I can't wear this.

06:10.525 --> 06:12.355
I hope you have fun tonight.

06:13.058 --> 06:15.596
I'm sorry it's been so hard
on you here

06:15.699 --> 06:18.595
but I know you'll make
some new friends soon.

06:18.697 --> 06:20.537
I don't want new friends.

06:23.303 --> 06:24.574
I know.

06:26.045 --> 06:27.610
They'll be here soon.

06:52.467 --> 06:53.830
All right, let's go.

06:53.932 --> 06:55.937
C'mon, honey, c'mon.

06:56.039 --> 06:57.437

06:57.539 --> 06:59.741
Excuse me.

07:04.411 --> 07:05.776

07:05.878 --> 07:07.677
Hey, Terry!
Come on in. Carol.

07:07.779 --> 07:09.619
That's Elvis's dad.

07:10.186 --> 07:11.948

07:14.722 --> 07:16.290

Good to see you.
And who do we have here?

07:37.944 --> 07:40.644
Uh, Elvis, this is
Priscilla Beaulieu.

07:40.746 --> 07:42.312
I'm gonna go find Carol.

07:42.414 --> 07:44.321
Hey.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.623
Uh, would you
like to have a seat?

07:54.597 --> 07:56.193
So, what are you
doing over here?

07:57.095 --> 08:00.535
My dad's stationed in, uh, Wiesbaden.

08:00.637 --> 08:03.003
- Where do you come from?
- Austin, Texas.

08:03.338 --> 08:05.140
Austin, hmm...

08:05.242 --> 08:06.610
Do you like it here?

08:07.510 --> 08:10.006
- It's okay.

08:10.108 --> 08:12.347
What... What are you,
about a junior

08:12.449 --> 08:14.684
or a senior in high school?

08:16.286 --> 08:18.314
- Ninth.
- Ninth...

08:19.288 --> 08:20.917
Ninth what?

08:21.019 --> 08:23.324
- Grade.

08:23.426 --> 08:25.458
Ninth grade.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.224
Why, you're just a baby!

08:27.933 --> 08:28.929
Thanks.

08:30.061 --> 08:31.996
It seems the little girl
has spunk.

08:32.099 --> 08:34.570

- I... I'll be right back.

08:34.672 --> 08:36.440

There's meat,

09:37.402 --> 09:39.666
dairy, fruits and vegetables.

09:39.768 --> 09:41.837
They all make up
the food pyramid.

09:47.105 --> 09:49.306
- Hello?
<i>- Priscilla, it's Terry.</i>

09:50.609 --> 09:51.677

09:56.483 --> 09:57.721

09:58.784 --> 10:00.051

10:00.153 --> 10:03.089
<i>You want me to ask your father?</i>

10:07.192 --> 10:09.095

<i>Let me talk to him.</i>

10:12.598 --> 10:14.137
Okay.

10:14.239 --> 10:15.998
Thank you. Bye.

10:32.792 --> 10:34.522
Dodger, baby,
what would we do without you?

10:34.625 --> 10:36.556
I don't know.
Oh, thank you.

10:36.658 --> 10:38.256
Priscilla, come here.

10:42.067 --> 10:43.259
Oh, aww.

10:43.362 --> 10:45.399
This here is, uh,
this is my grandma, Dodger.

10:45.501 --> 10:46.966
- Hi.
- Hello.

10:47.069 --> 10:48.901
When I was a kid,
I hit a ball straight at her

10:49.003 --> 10:51.035
and she dodged it,
so ever since then

10:51.137 --> 10:53.103
she's always...
She's been Dodger.

10:53.205 --> 10:56.106
Yeah, you almost
got yourself a whippin'!

10:56.208 --> 10:57.845
This is my buddy, Joe,
from back home.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.812
- Nice to meet you.
- Always stuffing his face.

10:59.914 --> 11:02.214
- I don't like schnitzel.
- C'mon.

11:11.495 --> 11:13.423
So, uh, so what... What...

11:13.525 --> 11:16.096
What are the kids back home
listening to these days?

11:16.829 --> 11:19.695
Mmm... Bobby Darin.

11:19.797 --> 11:21.398
Oh, no.

11:22.339 --> 11:24.005
And Fabian...

11:25.344 --> 11:26.942
- And you.

11:28.512 --> 11:30.207
Well, that's good, I...

11:30.310 --> 11:32.178
I thought they might've
forgotten about me.

11:32.912 --> 11:34.551
- No.

11:34.653 --> 11:36.413
What about you,
you got a favorite song?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.055
What, you gonna make me guess?

11:42.327 --> 11:43.323
<i>Heartbreak Hotel.</i>

11:45.530 --> 11:47.094
The kids still like it, huh?

11:48.198 --> 11:49.800
Wow.

11:50.201 --> 11:51.802
Well...

11:53.367 --> 11:55.498
What do you say maybe
we go somewhere more quiet?

11:59.170 --> 12:00.910
Would you come up to my room?

12:01.811 --> 12:03.207
You don't have to
be scared, baby.

12:03.310 --> 12:06.443
I'd never do anything
to harm you. I'm just...

12:08.047 --> 12:09.820
I really like talking to you.

12:12.785 --> 12:13.989
All right.

12:14.921 --> 12:16.286
We just go up the stairs,

12:16.389 --> 12:18.692
it's gonna be
the first door on your right.

12:18.794 --> 12:20.391
I'll meet you up there, okay?

12:21.298 --> 12:22.393
Okay.

12:23.235 --> 12:24.527

12:30.541 --> 12:33.239

13:05.205 --> 13:07.075
So, what else is going on
back home?

13:10.949 --> 13:13.445
I don't think
things have changed that much.

13:13.547 --> 13:15.149
Hmm.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.188
It's really nice
to talk to someone from home.

13:22.322 --> 13:24.826
And, uh, I know
a lot of girls here and...

13:24.928 --> 13:27.194
And none of them
are from the States.

13:31.328 --> 13:33.398
I wish my mama could've met you.

13:34.669 --> 13:36.539
She, uh...

13:36.642 --> 13:38.403
She passed on just last August.

13:41.679 --> 13:43.243
She would've really liked you.

13:44.748 --> 13:47.410
I wish I could have met her.

13:47.512 --> 13:50.046
She's my whole world,
my mama, and, uh...

13:50.148 --> 13:51.922
I talk to her every day.

13:53.320 --> 13:55.484
And now Dee's got her grips
on my daddy.

13:55.587 --> 13:57.493
He's under her spell.
She's trying to turn him

13:57.595 --> 13:59.590
into something he's not.

13:59.692 --> 14:02.966
I don't know how I'm gonna go
back to Graceland without her.

14:03.068 --> 14:05.067
That's the... That's the home
that I bought for her.

14:07.339 --> 14:08.433
I'm just...

14:09.772 --> 14:11.337
I just really miss her.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.344

Well, thank you, ma'am.

16:34.679 --> 16:36.920
Just what is the intent here,
Mr. Presley?

16:37.022 --> 16:38.449
Well, let's face it,
you're Elvis Presley.

16:38.551 --> 16:41.520
You got women
throwing themselves at you.

16:42.626 --> 16:44.193
Why my daughter?

16:45.659 --> 16:48.392
Well, sir, I happen to be
very fond of your daughter.

16:48.494 --> 16:50.693
Uh, she's much more mature
than her age

16:50.795 --> 16:53.598
and I really do enjoy
spending time with her.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.970
I have to admit, you know,
it hasn't been easy for me

16:57.072 --> 16:59.075
being away from home and all.

16:59.177 --> 17:01.377
But you don't have to worry
about her, Captain.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.308
Look, son,

17:03.410 --> 17:05.214
you'll need to
pick her up yourself.

17:06.176 --> 17:07.348
Yes, sir.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.782
Have her home by 2200.

17:09.884 --> 17:11.246
I understand.

17:11.348 --> 17:13.156
All right.

17:30.905 --> 17:32.208
Thank you.

17:34.679 --> 17:37.113
- You in?
- Yes.

17:37.215 --> 17:38.774
<i>Aren't you a teeny bit afraid</i>

17:38.876 --> 17:41.344
<i>that your friend might use it
as an excuse</i>

17:41.446 --> 17:43.349
<i>to begin negotiations elsewhere?</i>

17:43.452 --> 17:46.782
<i>If my friend
were looking for an excuse,</i>

17:46.884 --> 17:48.889
<i>he'd find a better one
in the morning papers.</i>

17:48.991 --> 17:50.357
<i>What do you mean?</i>

17:50.459 --> 17:52.155
<i>I'm talking about
the untimely demise</i>

17:52.257 --> 17:53.559
<i>of Paul Vanmere.</i>

17:56.401 --> 17:58.630
<i>Look, here, Peterson, you don't
have to convince me of anything.</i>

17:58.732 --> 18:00.332
<i>You don't care what I think
as long as I don't</i>

18:00.434 --> 18:02.532
<i>do anything about it.
And I won't,</i>

18:02.634 --> 18:04.237
<i>unless you ever decide
to sic that</i>

18:04.339 --> 18:06.171
<i>knife-happy
little junkie on me.</i>

18:06.274 --> 18:08.042
<i>Watch yourself, laddie.</i>

18:08.144 --> 18:10.444
<i>Now, Jack,
behave yourself.</i>

18:10.945 --> 18:12.512
<i>Sit down.</i>

18:14.015 --> 18:15.615
<i>For shame, Billy.</i>

18:15.717 --> 18:18.921
<i>I think you owe an apology
to everybody in this room.</i>

18:19.023 --> 18:20.818
You ever see
<i>On The Waterfront?</i>

18:21.354 --> 18:24.189
- No.
- Oh, you gotta see it.

18:24.292 --> 18:26.128
There's no one else
like him.

18:26.230 --> 18:29.331
That's the kind of actor
that I wanna be...

18:30.296 --> 18:32.061
I'm sure you will be.

18:32.831 --> 18:36.900
I wanna study at
The Actors Studio in New York,

18:37.002 --> 18:40.606
and tell stories I can really
put myself into, you know?

18:41.440 --> 18:44.181
Like Brando and James Dean.

18:45.312 --> 18:46.976
Well, I think you'd be great.

18:51.784 --> 18:53.448
I don't even know
if I'll have a music career

18:53.550 --> 18:55.489
- when I get back.
- What?

18:56.287 --> 18:57.590
Sure you will.

19:00.791 --> 19:03.594
Well, I better go,
it's getting late.

19:03.696 --> 19:05.800
Hold on, they give us these
to stay awake

19:05.902 --> 19:07.501
for night maneuvers.

19:07.603 --> 19:10.438
You can take one in class
if you need to stay awake.

19:13.909 --> 19:15.545
Thank you.

19:22.184 --> 19:24.518
- Good night.
- Good night.

20:43.431 --> 20:45.368
I'm just afraid

I'm not gonna forget you, Cilla.

20:50.137 --> 20:51.704
Don't you worry.

21:01.045 --> 21:03.186
I know it's not gonna be easy
going back to

21:03.288 --> 21:05.355
being a schoolgirl, Cilla,
but you got to.

21:06.522 --> 21:09.258
Now, I want you to try
to have a good time,

21:09.360 --> 21:11.723
and write me letters
every chance you get.

21:11.825 --> 21:14.364
You get pink stationary
and address them to Joe.

21:18.832 --> 21:21.063
And promise me
you'll stay the way you are now?

21:24.808 --> 21:25.969
I will.

21:31.312 --> 21:32.877
I want you to have this.

21:39.486 --> 21:41.083
All right, baby,
this is it.

21:42.858 --> 21:45.694
Now, don't worry. I'll call you
as soon as I get there.

21:45.797 --> 21:47.790
I promise.

21:47.892 --> 21:49.491
Now, I don't wanna see
a sad face.

22:07.786 --> 22:09.386
Bye, baby.

22:13.021 --> 22:15.524
Elvis!

23:19.349 --> 23:22.725
So, the Robinsons invited us
over for dinner next week.

23:22.827 --> 23:24.188
Oh, good.

24:04.865 --> 24:08.099
Maybe it's time
to forget about him.

24:08.201 --> 24:09.433
Hmm?

24:09.535 --> 24:11.266
I know it's hard,

24:12.609 --> 24:15.974
but he's probably
with women his own age.

24:16.076 --> 24:20.044
What about boys at school?
Must be some handsome ones.

24:32.463 --> 24:34.828
- Hello?
<i>How's my little one?</i>

24:37.330 --> 24:38.700
Elvis?

24:43.337 --> 24:44.772
I'm fine...

24:45.407 --> 24:46.972
Only I... I miss you.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.976
I thought you'd
forgotten about me.

24:51.677 --> 24:53.980
My parents said you did.

24:54.082 --> 24:57.312
<i>Oh, baby, things just got
a little crazy being back.</i>

25:00.150 --> 25:02.421
Is it true
about you and Nancy Sinatra?

25:02.523 --> 25:03.888
<i>No, she's a friend.</i>

25:03.990 --> 25:06.256
<i>I'm appearing
on her father's show.</i>

25:06.358 --> 25:09.995
<i>You know, I miss you, baby.
I think about you all the time.</i>

25:12.137 --> 25:14.463
I've missed you so much.

25:14.565 --> 25:17.299
<i>I'd like to make arrangements
for you to visit me in Memphis.</i>

25:20.505 --> 25:21.710
What?

25:24.180 --> 25:25.813
Oh, God, um...

25:26.815 --> 25:29.884
I don't think
my parents will ever let me.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.048
<i>Well, leave that to me.</i>

26:49.530 --> 26:51.167
Come on in, honey.

26:53.870 --> 26:56.371
- Here, let me take your things.
- Thank you.

26:56.473 --> 26:58.572
- Well, you made it!
- Yeah.

26:58.674 --> 27:01.003
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes.

27:01.105 --> 27:03.574
I bet you would like
a lemonade.

27:05.143 --> 27:07.277
And the boys are just
right down there.

27:09.184 --> 27:10.549
Ooh!

27:10.651 --> 27:13.022
That's a good shot.

27:14.954 --> 27:17.392
I see her.
There she is!

27:17.494 --> 27:19.195
Let me get a good look at you.

27:19.297 --> 27:21.993
Hi. Come on. Mmm-mmm.

27:22.096 --> 27:23.895
Where you been all my life?
Let me see you.

27:23.997 --> 27:25.533
Let me see you.
You look beautiful.

27:25.635 --> 27:27.899
Oh, you look beautiful.

27:28.001 --> 27:29.531
- Thank you.
- You gotta meet the guys.

27:29.633 --> 27:32.671
This is Hog Ears. You know Joe.
And then the rest of 'em.

27:32.774 --> 27:35.108
- Nice to see you again.
- Hi.

27:35.477 --> 27:37.179
Jerry. A pleasure.

27:40.246 --> 27:42.413
O-Five, this here is, uh,
this here is Priscilla.

27:42.515 --> 27:43.916
Hello.

27:44.018 --> 27:46.348
Pleased to meet you, honey.
I'm Alberta.

27:46.450 --> 27:48.250
Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

27:48.352 --> 27:51.725
And we heard plenty about you.

27:51.827 --> 27:55.094
Boys, help yourselves.
Dig in, dig in.

27:55.861 --> 27:57.225
Leave some for Priscilla.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.629
- Hi. You hungry?
- It's beautiful here. No.

27:59.731 --> 28:01.331
You like it?

28:04.270 --> 28:06.742
I keep trying to tell him
to take me shopping.

28:06.844 --> 28:08.844
And he won't
take you shopping?
- Well...

28:08.946 --> 28:11.244
No, I take her,
I just... I just stand there.

28:11.347 --> 28:12.947
You tired?

28:13.481 --> 28:15.214
A little bit.

28:15.316 --> 28:16.719
Hmm.

28:16.821 --> 28:19.184
Why don't you go head upstairs?
I'll meet you.

28:19.286 --> 28:21.821
It's just, uh, it's just
the first door on your left.

28:32.299 --> 28:35.035
Oh, what up? What up?
Oh, this is serious.

28:35.137 --> 28:37.806
- Hey, boss, this is Evelyn.
- Evelyn? Who's Evelyn?

28:37.908 --> 28:40.205
Nice to meet you.

28:42.039 --> 28:43.846
Wow, she's young, huh?

28:44.880 --> 28:47.680
She's like a little girl.

29:23.284 --> 29:25.819
Don't let me sleep
no later than 3:00 tomorrow.

29:25.921 --> 29:27.549
You got it, boss.

29:31.496 --> 29:32.925
Where are you, baby?

29:33.027 --> 29:35.557
I'm here.
I'll be just a few minutes.

29:36.601 --> 29:37.893
All right. Don't take too long.

29:37.995 --> 29:39.869
I wanna see my girl.

30:10.097 --> 30:12.132
You don't know
how much I missed you.

30:14.435 --> 30:17.137
I haven't been able to get you
out of my head since Germany.

30:21.505 --> 30:23.308
You're the one thing
that kept me going.

30:41.262 --> 30:45.094
Wait, hold on, baby,
things can get out of hand.

30:45.197 --> 30:47.334
What? Is there something wrong?

30:47.436 --> 30:48.930
Just...

30:49.032 --> 30:50.632
Just not yet.

30:53.170 --> 30:54.944
There'll be a right time.

31:06.789 --> 31:09.318
Here, you can take one of these.

31:09.420 --> 31:11.488
It'll help you sleep
after your trip.

31:28.346 --> 31:29.473
Come here.

31:43.219 --> 31:44.961
Priscilla?

31:45.528 --> 31:46.721
Priscilla?

31:47.762 --> 31:49.593
Priscilla, hon.

31:49.928 --> 31:51.996
It's Grandma.

31:52.098 --> 31:53.429
What did you give this young'un?

31:53.531 --> 31:55.163
You've got no business
givin' her something

31:55.265 --> 31:56.772
that she's not used to.

31:56.874 --> 31:58.904
You know how long
she's been like this?

31:59.006 --> 32:01.043
You need to call the doctor.

32:02.141 --> 32:04.176
I dunno, she's wakin' up.

32:04.278 --> 32:06.609
- I'll get her some water.
Mmm...

32:07.816 --> 32:10.181
- Where am I?
- Hi, baby.

32:10.283 --> 32:12.285
Baby, we've been
trying to wake you up.

32:13.150 --> 32:14.749
I just went to bed.

32:15.926 --> 32:18.488
No, baby, you've been out
for two days.

32:18.590 --> 32:21.790
On a goddamn 500 milligram
Placidyl. I... I...

32:21.892 --> 32:24.729
I must have been out of my head
givin' it to you that way.

32:24.831 --> 32:26.497
Mmm, mmm...

32:27.097 --> 32:28.466
Mmm, two days?

32:32.107 --> 32:34.340
Well, that's two days
off my trip.

32:35.673 --> 32:37.513
It's fine, you don't
have to worry about it.

32:37.615 --> 32:39.180
We got plenty of time.

32:40.247 --> 32:42.051
So, how'd you
like to go to Vegas?

32:44.086 --> 32:45.883
- Vegas?

33:50.954 --> 33:53.782
- Twenty-one!

33:53.884 --> 33:57.524
I'm sorry, baby, that's 22.
That's 22. That's a bust.

33:59.092 --> 34:00.894
- Oh.
- Cilla, baby.

34:15.845 --> 34:17.479
- Whoo!
Oh!

34:20.917 --> 34:22.748
Good for you, young lady.

34:22.850 --> 34:24.450
Whoo!

35:12.666 --> 35:15.432
Baby, I hate to say it,
but our time is up.

35:15.534 --> 35:18.534
No, I'm not going back.

35:18.636 --> 35:20.236
I'll call my parents
and tell them

35:20.338 --> 35:21.637
that I missed the flight.

35:21.739 --> 35:23.773
You really think
they're gonna believe that?

35:24.574 --> 35:26.147
Then I'll tell them the truth.

35:26.249 --> 35:27.843
That I love you
and I'm not going back.

35:27.945 --> 35:31.318
Baby, that's just gonna
make it worse for next time.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.188
I gotta go do another film,
so, if you go back

35:34.290 --> 35:35.856
and you do well in school
maybe your parents

35:35.958 --> 35:37.556
will let you come back.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.125
Yes, but when?

35:40.227 --> 35:42.191
We'll sort it out. Come here.

36:01.915 --> 36:03.246
What?

36:56.069 --> 36:57.468
Why you?

36:57.570 --> 36:59.334
Why can't he find someone
his own age?

36:59.436 --> 37:01.040
You're only 17.

37:01.142 --> 37:02.971
He's not like you imagine.

37:04.574 --> 37:06.880
And he needs me, Mom!

37:06.982 --> 37:09.015
I won't get hurt.

37:09.117 --> 37:10.978
Please, just talk to Dad.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.883
I only have a few more
credits left to graduate.

37:16.189 --> 37:17.755
- Please.

37:20.556 --> 37:22.364
All right.

37:24.935 --> 37:26.500
Now help me with these.

37:27.903 --> 37:29.536
<i>Sir,</i>

37:29.638 --> 37:31.766
<i>I promise to enroll her
in a good Catholic school</i>

37:31.868 --> 37:34.637
<i>and I'll make sure
she graduates.</i>

37:34.739 --> 37:36.771
<i>She'll live with my father
and Dee</i>

37:36.873 --> 37:38.806
<i>and have a chaperone
at all times.</i>

37:38.908 --> 37:40.445
- Mmm-hmm <i>.
- And my grandmother</i>

37:40.547 --> 37:43.649
<i>and my cousin Patsy
are here, too.</i>

37:43.751 --> 37:46.014
<i>She'll be looked after
as part of the family here.</i>

37:47.424 --> 37:49.488
<i>I love your daughter
and I can assure you</i>

37:49.590 --> 37:52.324
<i>that my intentions
are honorable, sir.</i>

37:52.426 --> 37:53.925
Well, I appreciate
the call, son.

37:54.027 --> 37:55.623
Bye-bye.

38:00.999 --> 38:02.933
She's gotta forget about him.

38:03.035 --> 38:06.306
And what if she doesn't?
Then she'll never forgive us.

38:06.408 --> 38:08.105
She's gotta finish school.

38:08.207 --> 38:09.510
I know...

38:10.475 --> 38:12.014
But what are we gonna do?

38:12.116 --> 38:13.579
She said
if we don't let her go,

38:13.681 --> 38:15.746
she's going to find a way
to get there on her own.

38:15.848 --> 38:17.782
She's not gonna get there
on her own.

38:21.891 --> 38:23.219
Welcome.

38:33.562 --> 38:34.933
Oh, Priscilla.

38:35.035 --> 38:37.436
Sorry Elvis's shoot's delayed.
He'll be back soon.

38:37.538 --> 38:39.139
I'll take her
for school registration

38:39.241 --> 38:40.538
just as soon as she's settled.

38:40.640 --> 38:43.073
This girl will be
well looked after.

38:43.176 --> 38:44.743
Thank you.

38:53.484 --> 38:55.050
Please don't worry.

38:57.487 --> 38:58.823
I'll be fine.

40:11.698 --> 40:14.399
Okay, so we'll pick that up
on Friday?

40:14.502 --> 40:16.400
- Oh, hi, Priscilla.
- Hello.

40:16.502 --> 40:18.370
I'm Patsy, this is Becky.

40:18.472 --> 40:20.740
- Hi.
- We run the office here.

40:20.842 --> 40:23.338
It's nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

40:23.440 --> 40:24.907
Us too.

40:25.009 --> 40:27.815
Elvis left a gift for you
on the back patio.

40:27.917 --> 40:29.351
Oh, okay.

40:29.453 --> 40:31.613
You give us a holler
if you need anything.

40:31.715 --> 40:33.580
Okay, thank you. Bye.

40:37.191 --> 40:38.857
Hello!

40:39.325 --> 40:41.530
Who are you? Hi.

40:42.361 --> 40:43.928
Hey, little one!

40:44.429 --> 40:46.029
Happy dog.

40:52.903 --> 40:54.738
<i>How's my girl?</i>

40:54.840 --> 40:57.546
I just can't believe
I'm really here.

40:58.781 --> 41:01.280
<i>Yeah, I only have
a little longer on this shoot</i>

41:01.382 --> 41:02.845
<i>and then I'll be home.</i>

41:02.947 --> 41:04.549
<i>Is everyone
taking good care of you?</i>

41:04.651 --> 41:07.954
Yes. Everyone's been
really nice.

41:08.057 --> 41:10.051
<i>- All right, that's good.</i>
<i>Elvis,
they're ready for you!</i>

41:10.153 --> 41:12.561
<i>All right, baby,
I gotta get back to set.</i>

41:13.327 --> 41:15.663
Okay. I miss you.

41:16.495 --> 41:18.166
<i>Good night, baby.</i>

41:18.268 --> 41:20.129
- Bye.

41:34.144 --> 41:37.144
- Good luck, have a good day.
- Thank you.

41:37.247 --> 41:39.013
Now, you won't be able
to invite anyone over.

41:39.115 --> 41:40.682
Strangers aren't allowed
in Graceland.

41:42.486 --> 41:43.724
Okay.

41:54.198 --> 41:57.100
That's Priscilla,
the girl Elvis is seeing.

41:59.907 --> 42:02.340
And how does friendship
influence who we are

42:02.442 --> 42:04.406
and what we become?

42:04.508 --> 42:06.843
- Your reports are due Friday.
...with Elvis Presley.

42:06.945 --> 42:08.749
Remember to cite examples
from the text...

42:08.851 --> 42:11.716
If we make friends with her
maybe we can meet him.

42:11.818 --> 42:13.981
And you will be graded
on penmanship

42:14.083 --> 42:16.290
as well as
spelling and grammar.

42:33.604 --> 42:35.008
Oh, honey,

42:35.110 --> 42:38.075
you can't be out here
making a public display
of yourself.

42:38.710 --> 42:40.547
Oh, I didn't think it...

42:40.649 --> 42:42.618
Well, you had
better start thinking.

42:49.553 --> 42:50.791
Come on.

43:22.424 --> 43:23.789
<i>How elegant!</i>

43:23.891 --> 43:26.822
<i>The most elegant cake
of all: chiffon.</i>

43:26.924 --> 43:28.761
<i>Now dramatically different.</i>

43:28.863 --> 43:31.266
<i>New and deluxe
vanilla cream chiffon</i>

43:31.368 --> 43:33.328
<i>with an exotic new taste!</i>

43:33.430 --> 43:37.904
<i>It's vanilla, cream
and a French flavor secret.</i>

43:38.471 --> 43:40.642
<i>Tantalizing.</i>

43:40.744 --> 43:42.104
<i>I said
to the director today,</i>

43:42.207 --> 43:44.345
<i>"Why'd we come all the way
to Los Angeles</i>

43:44.448 --> 43:45.647
<i>"to film the Smoky Mountains?</i>

43:45.749 --> 43:47.145
<i>"Hell, you may know more
about movie makin',</i>

43:47.247 --> 43:49.283
<i>"but I know a thing or two
about the Smoky Mountains.</i>

43:49.385 --> 43:50.244
<i>"And I'll tell you what,</i>

43:50.347 --> 43:52.413
<i>"they ain't got no
coconut trees on 'em!"</i>

43:54.752 --> 43:56.355
<i>You there, baby?</i>

43:56.457 --> 43:58.056
Mmm-hmm, I'm here.

43:58.987 --> 44:00.256
<i>How're you doin'?</i>

44:01.230 --> 44:02.792
I'm great.

44:02.895 --> 44:05.333
It's all been really wonderful.

44:05.435 --> 44:07.129
<i>That's what I like to hear.</i>

44:07.231 --> 44:09.233
<i>Baby, do you have
everything you need?</i>

44:09.702 --> 44:11.333
<i>How you doin' on cash?</i>

44:12.342 --> 44:14.441
It's funny you should ask.

44:14.543 --> 44:16.442
Your daddy's pretty strict.

44:17.979 --> 44:20.749
<i>Yeah, that's my daddy.
He's always been tight.</i>

44:20.851 --> 44:23.076
<i>That's why I have him
taking care of the bills.</i>

44:23.178 --> 44:25.620
<i>I don't trust anybody else.</i>

44:25.723 --> 44:27.922
<i>Don't worry about it,
I'll talk to him.</i>

44:28.024 --> 44:31.123
There's a boutique that said
I could work there part-time.

44:31.225 --> 44:34.125
I thought I could work there
a few days a week after school.

44:36.766 --> 44:38.360
<i>Well, you'll have to
forget about that.</i>

44:39.501 --> 44:41.066
I thought it could be fun.

44:43.300 --> 44:45.135
<i>Well, it's either me
or a career, baby.</i>

44:45.237 --> 44:47.776
<i>When I call you,
I need you to be there for me.</i>

44:49.409 --> 44:50.645
Mmm-hmm.

44:50.747 --> 44:52.748
<i>Just a few more days
and we'll be home.</i>

44:54.513 --> 44:55.817
Okay.

44:56.879 --> 44:59.351
I love you. Bye.

44:59.453 --> 45:00.855
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

45:10.730 --> 45:13.227
Memphis, we're back, baby!

45:13.329 --> 45:16.169
It's good to be home!
Where's my Cilla?

45:16.271 --> 45:17.666
Hello.

45:17.768 --> 45:19.703
Hello. Hello.

45:24.673 --> 45:26.842
Dodger, you waited for me too.
Bless your little heart.

45:26.944 --> 45:28.783
I did. Welcome home, baby.

45:28.885 --> 45:30.944
Good to see you, baby.
O-Five, what's for dinner?

45:32.883 --> 45:34.284
Cilla, come here.

45:35.918 --> 45:37.254
How's school?

45:37.920 --> 45:39.321
Oh, it's okay.

45:39.423 --> 45:42.090
- I don't really talk
to anybody there.
- Hmm.

45:42.192 --> 45:44.195
Grandma and Patsy
have been nice.

45:44.729 --> 45:46.329
I missed you.

45:47.464 --> 45:49.637
I've been trying to
find things to do with my...

45:49.739 --> 45:51.365
You gotta keep up
with your schoolwork

45:51.467 --> 45:53.435
otherwise your father
won't let you stay.

45:54.778 --> 45:57.439
- I know, but...
- You sure do look pretty.

45:58.373 --> 46:00.145
C'mon, let's have
something to eat.

46:03.049 --> 46:04.748
O-Five, I sure did
miss you, baby!

46:04.850 --> 46:06.418
Let me see you.

46:06.520 --> 46:07.816
Hand me a plate.

46:09.454 --> 46:11.626
I'll tell you,
that Ursula was always around.

46:11.728 --> 46:13.856
Oh, goddamn man,
she was a big woman.

46:13.958 --> 46:15.422
- She was.

46:15.524 --> 46:18.127
- Was she pretty?
- She had a body like a man.

46:18.229 --> 46:19.868
No hips,
shoulders broader than mine.

46:19.970 --> 46:22.664
Goddamn, I was scared to
take my shirt off next to her.

46:23.905 --> 46:25.773
But, E,
she only had eyes for you.

46:25.875 --> 46:27.808
No way, man,
not with that John Derek

46:27.910 --> 46:29.572
just lurking around
with them beady eyes.

46:32.408 --> 46:35.246
Probably snores like a man.

46:35.348 --> 46:37.677
God, I tell you, man,
I can't stand that guy.

46:37.779 --> 46:40.453
What's that guy, 5'7"?
God, five-nothing.

46:40.555 --> 46:42.189
Five foot-nothing.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.462
Why are you taking those now?
You'll fall asleep.

46:55.564 --> 46:57.598
It'll take a while
for 'em to take effect.

47:08.681 --> 47:10.083
How's my girl?

47:12.887 --> 47:14.582
I'm just so happy
you're back.

47:32.636 --> 47:35.438
Baby, don't... Don't... Don't...
Don't get carried away.

47:37.409 --> 47:40.146
You gotta let me decide
when we take this moment.

47:41.818 --> 47:43.919
It's just this is
very sacred to me.

47:47.017 --> 47:49.086
What about Anita?

47:49.188 --> 47:50.724
You mean you didn't
make love to her

47:50.826 --> 47:52.222
the whole time
you were together?

47:52.324 --> 47:55.325
That was different.
I mean, she was older.

47:55.427 --> 47:57.091
That's just... That's just
the way that I feel.

47:57.193 --> 47:59.000
What about how I feel?

48:00.132 --> 48:02.036
That's asking a lot of someone.

48:03.302 --> 48:05.369
It doesn't mean
we can't do other things.

48:17.546 --> 48:19.083
Hop in.
I wanna take you shopping.

48:27.123 --> 48:28.455
Come on. Come on.

48:40.107 --> 48:41.941
Well, would you
look at that, huh?

48:42.043 --> 48:43.605
Yeah!

48:45.610 --> 48:48.182
I think these clothes
are too sophisticated for me.

48:48.284 --> 48:51.047
Honey, what's sophisticated?
You could go around in a feather

48:51.149 --> 48:52.480
and it'll be sophisticated.

48:52.582 --> 48:55.190
- Yeah, that's right.

48:59.025 --> 49:00.594
Yeah, how many we got?

49:03.832 --> 49:05.861
Oh...
Wow!

49:05.963 --> 49:07.431
Oh-ho-ho.

49:07.533 --> 49:10.069
- We have a winner right there!
Absolutely.

49:10.171 --> 49:12.766
I like you in blue, yeah.
Blue's your color.

49:22.452 --> 49:23.513
Oh. I like that.

49:25.614 --> 49:27.655
Prints take away
from your looks.

49:27.757 --> 49:29.220
Oh, it's like a forest.

49:29.323 --> 49:31.387
- I like this one.
- No, solids suit you better.

49:31.489 --> 49:34.458
And I hate brown.
It reminds me of the army.

49:41.997 --> 49:45.403
All right, the car's outside.
You got his in there too, right?

49:52.278 --> 49:55.982
Hmm... Black hair
and more eye makeup

49:56.084 --> 49:58.086
will make your eyes
stand out more.

49:58.987 --> 50:00.347
- Mmm-hmm.
It's 4:00, boys.

50:00.449 --> 50:02.116
We gotta go, barbecue's waiting.

50:02.218 --> 50:04.086
Come on.

50:04.188 --> 50:05.726
Come on, boys.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.728
Go, go, go!

51:35.782 --> 51:37.350
Mmm...

51:53.831 --> 51:55.902
I can't believe
she dyed her hair!

51:56.004 --> 51:57.570
Did she dye it just for him?

51:57.672 --> 51:58.767
Probably.

52:00.004 --> 52:01.275
Hello.

52:02.944 --> 52:04.443
What time is it?

52:05.109 --> 52:06.979
Almost 4:00.

52:07.081 --> 52:08.678
I brought breakfast for you.

52:11.314 --> 52:12.812
I got this for you.

52:15.618 --> 52:17.423
- Thank you!

52:18.223 --> 52:19.788
- Right there?
- Okay.

52:20.729 --> 52:22.296
All right.

52:24.260 --> 52:25.296
Very nice.

52:25.398 --> 52:27.466

Hello.

54:23.084 --> 54:24.715
Now, what is that dress?

54:26.517 --> 54:28.686
Uh, that doesn't suit you, baby.

54:30.293 --> 54:33.557
- It doesn't?
- No, it does nothin' for you.

54:33.660 --> 54:36.859
Takes away from your eyes
and from your face.

54:36.961 --> 54:39.166
Oh, man, it does nothing
for your figure. All you see

54:39.268 --> 54:40.902
- is a goddamn dress.
- You finished?

54:41.004 --> 54:42.566
Satnin, you're a small girl.

54:42.668 --> 54:44.732
You gotta keep away
from the prints, baby!

54:44.834 --> 54:47.172
Okay, I'll return
the fucking dress!

54:56.585 --> 54:58.746
Priscilla, final exams
are coming up.

54:58.848 --> 55:00.583
You will need to
keep your grades up

55:00.685 --> 55:02.753
in order to graduate
with your class.

55:03.618 --> 55:05.118
Yes, Sister Adrian.

55:10.663 --> 55:13.367
Dad, I'm doing great.
You don't have to...

55:13.469 --> 55:15.862
Y <i>ou still
doing well in school?</i>

55:15.964 --> 55:17.734
Yes, of course
I'm doing well in school.

55:17.836 --> 55:19.866
<i>Uh-huh. Do you know
we want you to graduate?</i>

55:19.968 --> 55:23.541
Yes, I will graduate.
Don't worry.

55:23.643 --> 55:25.512
<i>Your mother and I
miss you very much.</i>

55:26.179 --> 55:27.508
I miss you too.

55:27.610 --> 55:29.183
<i>Well, you stay in touch.</i>

55:29.285 --> 55:32.019
- Mmm-hmm, I will.
<i>- Well, we love you.</i>

55:32.121 --> 55:33.686
- Talk to you soon.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

55:33.788 --> 55:35.022
Bye.

56:18.397 --> 56:20.168
Pass that across.

01:12:38.807 --> 01:12:41.008
- Here.

01:13:36.305 --> 01:13:38.802
Daddy, I'm lonesome
and depressed.

01:13:38.904 --> 01:13:41.535
And the Colonel's meddling
in my music behind my back,

01:13:41.637 --> 01:13:43.309
telling me how to record,

01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:46.244
in the way that
RCA wants it to sound.

01:13:46.346 --> 01:13:47.644
I don't wanna record up front.

01:13:47.747 --> 01:13:49.475
I wanna do it the way
that I always done it,

01:13:49.577 --> 01:13:51.177
with the band.

01:13:54.421 --> 01:13:56.248
I feel like nobody understands.

01:13:58.988 --> 01:14:01.954
<i>When I was a girl
back in Tennessee,</i>

01:14:02.056 --> 01:14:04.823

01:14:04.925 --> 01:14:06.493

"Tickle Me." These scripts
are all fucking awful!

01:14:15.371 --> 01:14:17.609
And the Colonel just wants me to
keep doing these dumb musicals.

01:14:17.711 --> 01:14:20.107
When's he gonna send me
a goddamn decent script?

01:14:22.078 --> 01:14:24.279
Why don't you ask
for something more serious?

01:14:25.846 --> 01:14:27.653
It doesn't work like that.

01:14:29.050 --> 01:14:30.986
He's gotta send me
something better.

01:14:33.356 --> 01:14:40.260

01:14:43.471 --> 01:14:45.065

01:14:47.705 --> 01:14:49.708

- Listen to that.

01:14:59.781 --> 01:15:01.547

01:15:03.153 --> 01:15:05.889

01:15:07.261 --> 01:15:08.859
Cilla, what do you think?

01:15:11.397 --> 01:15:12.995
I don't know if I like it.

01:15:14.735 --> 01:15:16.603
What do you mean
you don't know if you like it?

01:15:19.439 --> 01:15:20.937
I don't know, there's just...

01:15:21.039 --> 01:15:24.241
Something about it,
a catchiness that it's missing.

01:15:24.343 --> 01:15:25.912
Watch out!

01:15:30.645 --> 01:15:33.147
I'm sorry, baby.

01:15:33.249 --> 01:15:36.519
Are you okay? I'm sorry, baby.
I got my mama's temper.

01:15:36.622 --> 01:15:38.220
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:39.890
Uh-huh.

01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:43.597

Elvis, do you think the woman
at the well was a virgin?

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.624
Well, honey, that's something
you're gonna have to

01:16:13.726 --> 01:16:15.455
come to a conclusion
for yourself.

01:16:15.557 --> 01:16:17.060
Uh...

01:16:17.162 --> 01:16:19.828
I personally believe that Jesus
was attracted to the woman

01:16:19.930 --> 01:16:23.635
but that is, uh,
that is just my opinion.

01:16:23.737 --> 01:16:25.936
Why do you think
they were brought together?

01:16:27.038 --> 01:16:29.643
Well, you could look at it
different ways, and...

01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:32.338
Well, what do you think, Elvis?

01:16:33.214 --> 01:16:35.107
I like your perfume.

What's that called?

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.985
- Chanel No. 5.

Man's place in the universe

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:09.412
is like a drop of water
in the ocean.

01:17:09.514 --> 01:17:11.112
Elvis, look at me.

01:17:11.214 --> 01:17:13.879
You are not just a drop of
water in the ocean,

01:17:13.981 --> 01:17:15.920
you are the entire ocean.

01:17:16.988 --> 01:17:19.589
Cilla, this here is Larry.
He did my hair

01:17:19.691 --> 01:17:21.153
- on the last shoot.
- Hi.

01:17:21.255 --> 01:17:23.125
He knows more
about the spiritual realm

01:17:23.227 --> 01:17:26.933
than all the preachers
and the priests put together.

01:17:27.035 --> 01:17:30.731
Well, I don't know about that
but I am here to ask questions.

01:17:30.833 --> 01:17:32.398
Alongside my friend here.

01:17:33.804 --> 01:17:35.805
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:17:35.907 --> 01:17:37.810
I'm going to start packing
to go home.

01:17:50.283 --> 01:17:52.451
Larry said it'll help us
go deeper.

01:18:43.508 --> 01:18:45.108
Oh, my God.

01:18:45.809 --> 01:18:47.913
Your shirt is breathing.

01:19:28.452 --> 01:19:32.188
"And his host of evil spirits

Cilla, why...

01:19:50.605 --> 01:19:54.540
Why me? What am I supposed to do
with all this influence?

01:19:57.714 --> 01:19:59.518
I don't know.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:01.821

01:20:01.923 --> 01:20:05.053

01:20:05.155 --> 01:20:07.586
I mean, there's no one else
like him.

01:20:28.046 --> 01:20:30.978
No, baby,
we have to control our desires

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.952
otherwise they'll control us.

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:41.454
Cilla, this is never gonna work

01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:44.062
if you don't share
my interests and philosophies.

01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:47.700
I mean, there are
a lot of women out there

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:49.496
that would wanna share
in this with me.

01:20:54.635 --> 01:20:56.635

01:21:16.630 --> 01:21:18.657
It's driving me crazy!

01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:22.430
I don't wanna hear it anymore!

01:21:26.804 --> 01:21:28.403

01:21:31.245 --> 01:21:33.010
No.

who needs to be desired.

01:26:28.835 --> 01:26:31.104
You could put a parachute

01:27:08.144 --> 01:27:09.510

- Oh, baby, you don't see...

01:29:16.007 --> 01:29:20.379
Well, you didn't do anything.
It's not you. It's just that...

01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:23.548
I've been going through
some things and I just...

01:29:26.081 --> 01:29:28.520
I just think it'd be best
if we took a little break.

01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:37.661

01:29:49.871 --> 01:29:51.906

Don't leave.

Go, go!

01:30:47.494 --> 01:30:48.930
Oh...

01:30:50.230 --> 01:30:53.972
Daddy, it's time.
You need to send a car up, okay?

01:30:55.704 --> 01:30:58.877
Oh.

01:31:42.689 --> 01:31:44.148

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:46.121
Mmm-hmm.

Elvis, it's been so long...

I know, I just don't
wanna hurt you, baby.

01:33:32.364 --> 01:33:33.963
Well, I'm okay.

01:33:36.567 --> 01:33:38.132
Let's just wait a little.

01:33:55.448 --> 01:33:58.350
- Hi, sweetie.

01:33:59.856 --> 01:34:01.760
- She's ready for her nap.
- Okay.

01:34:03.427 --> 01:34:05.027
Sweet dreams.

01:34:14.308 --> 01:34:15.936
Satnin, I don't know.

01:34:16.038 --> 01:34:18.239

But I'll be home soon as I can.

01:36:25.465 --> 01:36:28.068

Hi, Momma.

01:39:14.641 --> 01:39:16.371
I need you to lighten up.

a little too good

01:40:58.737 --> 01:41:01.606

straight in the nose.

because, um...

01:41:04.317 --> 01:41:07.479

a bit loose, but... No.

Okay, thank you.

He never goes to his room
between shows.

01:43:05.637 --> 01:43:08.202
Um, I'm gonna go see what's up
and I'll meet you guys after.

You don't mean that, Satnin.
You can't.

01:45:04.557 --> 01:45:06.952
You mean I've been so blind
I didn't see this coming?

01:45:08.259 --> 01:45:10.054
We're living separate lives.

01:45:14.398 --> 01:45:16.764
Have I lost you to another man?

01:45:18.766 --> 01:45:21.131
You're losing me
to a life of my own.

01:45:30.314 --> 01:45:32.516
I have to go.

01:45:36.155 --> 01:45:37.987
