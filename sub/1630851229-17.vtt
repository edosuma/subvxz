-the interns I told you about.
-I'm Zach,

-Primary Care.
-Let's get started, shall we?

00:07.675 --> 00:08.899
Listen, I'm not a man

00:08.917 --> 00:09.916
that you'll find
in Child's Pose,

00:10.011 --> 00:11.251
so I'm just gonna be
on my way to...

00:11.403 --> 00:13.420
AJ, I happen to know
from personal experience

00:13.572 --> 00:15.347
that you could really benefit
from a little extra flexibility.

00:15.574 --> 00:18.075
-(laughter)
-All right, come lie down
and grab a mat.

00:18.093 --> 00:19.743
I don't know if I want kids.

00:19.836 --> 00:20.927
At least not right now.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.004
What Padma wants
can help us both.

00:23.098 --> 00:25.357
I can give her the egg
she so desperately wants

00:25.584 --> 00:27.526
so she can have a baby,
and at the same time

00:27.753 --> 00:30.487
I can freeze some for us.

00:32.682 --> 00:34.733
-What about him?
-This guy?

00:34.960 --> 00:36.976
Yeah. He runs marathons,

00:37.129 --> 00:38.278
plays the cello and,

00:38.372 --> 00:42.524
Oh, Leela, look at that
chubby little face. Aww.

00:42.601 --> 00:45.936
Well, I wish we could meet
"Tall & Talented" in person.

00:45.954 --> 00:48.789
Or maybe see an adult photo,
not just a baby photo.

00:48.941 --> 00:50.440
Well, then these anonymous
sperm donors

00:50.459 --> 00:52.033
wouldn't be very anonymous,
would they?

00:52.053 --> 00:53.552
I just want the father
of your child

00:53.703 --> 00:54.702
to be as amazing as you.

00:54.797 --> 00:56.463

Grade A sperm.

00:56.615 --> 00:58.432
Thank you for
doing this for me.

01:00.043 --> 01:01.376
What, you think I'm doing this
for you? No.

01:01.395 --> 01:03.287
I'm only giving you my egg
so I can be an auntie.

01:03.305 --> 01:06.273
(laughs) Well, you're gonna be
the best one.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.443

01:12.073 --> 01:13.906
-"The Right Stuff"?
-Yeah.

01:14.057 --> 01:16.967
He loves yoga, travel
and Basquiat.

01:16.985 --> 01:18.893
No markers for genetic disease.

01:18.987 --> 01:20.913
And he's South Asian.

01:21.064 --> 01:22.472
I think it's a sign.

01:22.566 --> 01:24.583
Okay, well, why don't we
email the sperm bank

01:24.734 --> 01:28.312
-and try to get a voice sample?
-Leel, he is the one,
I can feel it.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.238
No, no, you don't need
to decide right now.

01:30.257 --> 01:33.650

-I am.

09:28.977 --> 09:31.144
I'm gonna chat with
your dad real quick.

09:32.147 --> 09:34.814
Thought a fun distraction
for Peter could be good.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.741
So his labs came back.

09:36.968 --> 09:39.226
White blood cell count was
normal, no sign of infection.

09:39.246 --> 09:42.080
Appendicitis, uh...
seems unlikely.

09:42.231 --> 09:44.398
Maybe it's psychological.

09:44.492 --> 09:46.993
You know,
he's been through a lot.

09:47.145 --> 09:49.813
My gut's telling me
it's more than anxiety,

09:49.906 --> 09:51.648
and I want to run
a few more tests.

09:51.741 --> 09:52.665
What's up?

09:52.818 --> 09:54.426
Did you fix his tummy, Daddy?

09:54.653 --> 09:56.410
It's always his tummy.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.838
What do you mean, "always,"
sweetheart?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.098
It happened before?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.842
How often does your
tummy hurt, Pete?

10:02.936 --> 10:04.844
A whole lot of times.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.755
Why didn't you tell me
anything, Pete?

10:07.774 --> 10:10.350
-I don't understand.
-I didn't want to stay at home.

10:10.444 --> 10:14.762
I wanted to come here,
with you.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.765
I'll never leave you, okay?

10:17.934 --> 10:20.160
I'll never leave you.

10:22.789 --> 10:23.955
Do you understand?

10:24.182 --> 10:26.182
Daddy, there's something else.

10:26.275 --> 10:28.852
It's weird, but maybe
I should tell you.

10:28.870 --> 10:30.703
This morning,
Peter and I were playing

10:30.797 --> 10:32.780
that we were on another planet.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.024
He kept saying that
I had two heads.

10:35.043 --> 10:37.043
Yeah, you told me that.
Pretending.

10:37.195 --> 10:38.803
No, he meant it.

10:39.030 --> 10:43.016
He said I really<i> was</i>
a space alien.

10:45.294 --> 10:49.022
Peter, does anyone else
have two heads?

10:49.816 --> 10:52.484
That nurse lady and you,

10:52.635 --> 10:54.468
kind of.

10:55.304 --> 10:57.447
Double vision. How many fingers
am I holding up?

11:00.218 --> 11:02.661
-What's going on?
-This could be neurological.

11:02.829 --> 11:05.372
We need to get him to CT.

11:07.242 --> 11:10.985
So this woman, who is 83,
kept chickens.

11:11.062 --> 11:13.079
And she loved her chickens.

11:13.231 --> 11:14.898
She named each one of them.

11:14.916 --> 11:18.418
The-the first day I spent
with her, she gave me eggs.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.996
Anyway, she had a problem
with worsening anemia.

11:22.090 --> 11:25.332
Fatigue, muscle weakness,
intestinal problems.

11:25.427 --> 11:29.762
She started forgetting things
and... falling.

11:29.915 --> 11:32.840
Now, any ideas what was
wrong with her?

11:32.934 --> 11:35.435
Likely more than one thing.

11:35.587 --> 11:38.922
Alzheimer's,
and possibly cancer?

11:38.940 --> 11:40.514
Or a recent stroke.

11:40.608 --> 11:41.941
I'll give you a hint.

11:42.093 --> 11:44.185
The key was the chickens.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.946
People who name their chickens
don't eat them.

11:47.098 --> 11:49.432
Exactly. He's smart.

11:49.525 --> 11:50.875
You-you could be
a gerontologist.

11:51.027 --> 11:52.377
I don't get it.

11:52.528 --> 11:55.529
Okay, it's a B12 deficiency,
common with age.

11:55.549 --> 11:58.032
Learned that from
Dr. Kravitz's book.

11:58.051 --> 12:02.779
So I'm guessing that
the patient was a... vegan,

12:02.872 --> 12:05.372
because she gave away the eggs.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.800
Bingo.

12:07.953 --> 12:11.120
The woman's vegan diet
was a good choice

12:11.139 --> 12:13.456
because it reduced her risk
of heart disease,

12:13.549 --> 12:14.974
Type 2 diabetes,
certain cancers.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.351
But she forgot to supplement
with B12,

12:17.462 --> 12:19.312
which was the source of
all of her symptoms.

12:19.464 --> 12:23.800
This is why gerontology is
a great profession.

12:23.893 --> 12:26.227
You spend time with patients.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.820
You talk with them, you get
to know the whole person,

12:27.897 --> 12:31.583
all the while keeping your eye
on the big picture.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.918
Which is the key to diagnosis.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.813
Oh! My lady awaits.

12:36.831 --> 12:40.316
And I see that they have put out
snacks, and I am peckish.

12:40.409 --> 12:42.510
-Excuse me.
-BELL: Thank you, Dr. Kravitz.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.991
Hi, sweetie.

12:48.009 --> 12:50.101
Hey, maybe gerontology is
an aphrodisiac.

12:50.328 --> 12:52.586
This old goat has
the prettiest lady in the place,

12:52.606 --> 12:55.515
-and I have not had a date
since high school.
-Oh...

12:55.667 --> 12:57.609
No, no, I'm kidding.

12:57.760 --> 13:00.503
KRAVITZ:
Gloria!

13:00.596 --> 13:01.687
Her pulse is thready.

13:01.782 --> 13:03.114
Call 911.
Let's get her to Chastain.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.507
Somebody grab these pills.
to take with us.

13:04.526 --> 13:06.326
we're gonna need to know
what she's been taking.

13:13.442 --> 13:15.609
I don't understand.
Are you telling me I fainted?

13:15.703 --> 13:16.686
Yes. And they're going to

13:16.779 --> 13:17.796
figure out why.

13:17.872 --> 13:19.947
I was probably just
dehydrated.

13:19.966 --> 13:21.633
I didn't ruin your event,
did I?

13:21.784 --> 13:23.709
No, we were winding down anyway.

13:23.862 --> 13:25.286
You added the drama.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.639
The good news is,
your wrist isn't broken.

13:27.790 --> 13:28.881
You just need a splint.

13:29.034 --> 13:30.700
And your EKG and your labs
look normal.

13:30.793 --> 13:33.052
So how did you feel
right before you passed out?

13:33.204 --> 13:36.372
I got dizzy.
A little lightheaded.

13:36.465 --> 13:38.224
A-A drop in blood pressure.
It's not uncommon

13:38.376 --> 13:40.318
among women on
blood pressure meds.

13:40.545 --> 13:41.561
But she's-she's not on any.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.030
Oh, well, yes, I am, dear.

13:45.567 --> 13:47.733
-You are?
-Mm-hmm.

13:47.886 --> 13:49.476
Why didn't you tell me?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.737
I did.

13:51.832 --> 13:54.574
Let's start here.

13:54.726 --> 13:57.151
My thought exactly.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.745
<i> CONRAD:</i>
<i> Houston to Rocket Nine Niner,</i>

13:59.898 --> 14:01.506
<i> do you read me?</i>

14:01.657 --> 14:04.250
<i> Copy, Rocket Nine Niner.</i>

14:04.402 --> 14:06.511
<i> Please keep your hands</i>
<i> and arms</i>

14:06.662 --> 14:08.662
<i> inside the spacecraft.</i>

14:08.740 --> 14:10.073
<i> We are go for liftoff.</i>

14:10.166 --> 14:13.518
Over and out.
(imitating static, beeping)

14:13.669 --> 14:14.835
(Billie laughs)

14:14.929 --> 14:17.522
Was that for him
or for you?

14:17.673 --> 14:19.932
A little bit of both.

14:20.085 --> 14:22.176
I'm worried about him.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.605
If Peter's abdominal issues
are caused by

14:25.699 --> 14:28.992
a neurological one, we could be
looking at a bleed.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.782
I don't see one.

14:36.859 --> 14:39.878
No evidence of a stroke, either.

14:40.029 --> 14:42.772
(sighs) But his ventricles are
a little...

14:42.774 --> 14:45.425
Too little.

14:49.114 --> 14:50.704
His brain is swelling.

14:50.798 --> 14:52.873
Now, if we don't figure out why
and the swelling worsens,

14:52.893 --> 14:54.117
I'll have to perform
a craniectomy

14:54.119 --> 14:55.209
to relieve the pressure.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.211
Cutting a six-year-old's head
open on an "if."

14:57.230 --> 14:58.971
Of course not, but if things
move south quickly,

14:59.065 --> 15:00.456
we have to be ready
to move to the OR.

15:00.549 --> 15:02.808
Fine, but let's keep in mind
the risks aren't just

15:02.961 --> 15:04.051
bleeding and infection.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.403
There could be permanent
brain damage.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.798
We need to figure out how
to avoid surgery altogether.

15:08.816 --> 15:10.909
Let's start Peter on meds
to lower the pressure

15:10.985 --> 15:12.485
on his brain immediately,

15:12.637 --> 15:14.095
hope they work
and move him to ICU.

15:14.155 --> 15:16.806
Yes, that sounds like a plan.

15:16.899 --> 15:20.660
Well, why didn't you tell me
you were taking all of these?

15:20.812 --> 15:21.920
Oh, I did, dear.

15:22.071 --> 15:23.922
Every time I added
a medication.

15:24.073 --> 15:26.907
But you can't be expected
to remember all these.

15:27.001 --> 15:29.076
I-I forgot all of them.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.929
Multiple medications,
called polypharmacy,

15:31.080 --> 15:33.765
is associated with
adverse outcomes,

15:33.934 --> 15:36.008
particularly as we age.
They interact,

15:36.161 --> 15:38.177
causing falls, drug reactions,

15:38.329 --> 15:41.164
and can even lead
to increased mortality.

15:41.182 --> 15:42.999
It all started with
the arthritis.

15:43.017 --> 15:44.943
The ibuprofen wasn't
doing anything,

15:45.094 --> 15:47.853
so a doctor put me on
prednisone.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.930
Well, that gave me heartburn,

15:49.950 --> 15:51.783
so he gave me omeprazole.

15:51.934 --> 15:53.192
But then that
made me nauseous,

15:53.361 --> 15:56.437
so they added ondansetron
for my stomach.

15:56.531 --> 15:59.940
That made my heart flutter,
so they gave me metoprolol,

15:59.960 --> 16:01.442
and then my legs started
to swell,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.035
so they gave me furosemide,
and that's when

16:03.129 --> 16:05.279
I stopped walking very much,

16:05.298 --> 16:08.207
and, uh, my blood pressure
shot up, so they--

16:08.359 --> 16:09.968
Should I keep going?

16:10.195 --> 16:11.711
<i>MAN (over P.A.): ...practitioner</i>
<i> to the ER, please.</i>

16:11.863 --> 16:13.721
<i> Nurse practitioner to the ER.</i>

16:17.702 --> 16:19.035
Double shift?

16:19.128 --> 16:22.538
(chuckles)
Actually, I'm just starting.

16:22.631 --> 16:24.373
Been having
a hard time sleeping.

16:24.467 --> 16:27.210
-Oh, that sucks.
-Yeah, tell me about it.

16:27.228 --> 16:32.381
Oh, um, Leela told me
about your mother.

16:32.475 --> 16:33.825
How is she?

16:33.976 --> 16:36.719
Sorry, it's...
it's none of my business.

16:36.738 --> 16:38.888
No, it isn't.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.999
But it's nice of you to ask.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.908
She just moved in with me
on Saturday.

16:43.061 --> 16:45.077
It's been good
having her close.

16:45.230 --> 16:46.671
And how are you?

16:46.898 --> 16:49.340
Well, I'm trying
to resist the urge

16:49.417 --> 16:51.734
to check my home security camera
every five minutes

16:51.827 --> 16:54.070
to see how she's doing.

16:54.163 --> 16:56.663
Okay, well, actually,
I'm not resisting.

16:56.758 --> 17:00.518
Would you look at this woman?
She's out there gardening.

17:00.669 --> 17:01.911
Are those rhododendrons?

17:01.929 --> 17:06.415
A little pink for my taste,
but she loves them.

17:06.434 --> 17:09.694
I'm leading a meditation
at 3:00.

17:09.921 --> 17:13.156
-Join us.
-Maybe I will.

17:14.776 --> 17:16.942
-So, how are you?
-Great.

17:17.095 --> 17:18.852
I just injected my sister
with hormones

17:18.930 --> 17:20.020
so she can donate her eggs to me

17:20.114 --> 17:21.947
and I can be a mom.
Hmm!

17:22.042 --> 17:25.293
Oh, wear something comfortable.

17:29.716 --> 17:34.052
DEVON:
So they put her on
hydrochlorothiazide...

17:34.203 --> 17:36.203
And that made Gloria
feel fatigued.

17:36.297 --> 17:38.038
So they gave her
methylphenidate.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.540
Which could have had
a negative interaction

17:39.634 --> 17:42.301
with the linezolid that she
was taking for that cellulitis.

17:42.453 --> 17:43.895
Or the zolpidem or quetiapine,

17:44.046 --> 17:46.397
which Gloria was also on.

17:49.294 --> 17:51.218
-(exhales sharply)
-What are we even doing,

17:51.312 --> 17:52.461
Dr. Pravesh?

17:52.480 --> 17:55.648
We're looking into
all contraindications.

17:55.742 --> 17:58.150
But she is a sick older lady
who needs these drugs.

17:58.303 --> 18:00.745
Like, which do you even stop?

18:00.896 --> 18:02.580
We move carefully,

18:02.807 --> 18:06.334
removing one by one.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.312
No.

18:09.330 --> 18:12.832
This is over my head
and, honestly, kind of boring.

18:12.984 --> 18:14.258
I need to find a surgery
to observe.

18:14.410 --> 18:17.987
I thought you were going into
primary care.

18:18.005 --> 18:20.005
No. I want to be a surgeon.

18:20.158 --> 18:21.415
It's exciting,
and you fix problems

18:21.509 --> 18:24.510
that are actually fixable,
not buff up old people

18:24.662 --> 18:25.845
until they die.

18:25.997 --> 18:27.588
You don't think people die
on the OR table?

18:27.682 --> 18:29.014
They do all the time.

18:29.167 --> 18:30.833
Not everything is fixable
with a knife.

18:30.926 --> 18:31.925
You get that, right?

18:31.945 --> 18:33.669
You can fix things
with your brain.

18:33.762 --> 18:35.095
Excuse me, have you met me?

18:35.189 --> 18:36.689
I read that surgeons
don't actually have

18:36.765 --> 18:40.284
the highest IQ, and I thought,
there, that's my specialty.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.452
Hmm.

18:41.679 --> 18:43.604
This woman needs us,

18:43.623 --> 18:46.532
and Dr. Kravitz needs her.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.794
So if you're not interested,
I say go hunt down Dr. Austin

18:50.021 --> 18:52.037
and see if he'll let you
into his OR.

18:52.190 --> 18:53.965
But be aware that
he will not consider it

18:54.116 --> 18:56.192
for one nanosecond

18:56.285 --> 18:59.512
when I tell him
you deserted this patient.

19:04.978 --> 19:07.311
Okay, I will stay.

19:07.480 --> 19:11.524
But don't tell him about
that IQ thing, either.

19:16.805 --> 19:18.305
I want to go with him.

19:18.399 --> 19:20.158
You can't, honey.
He needs special care

19:20.385 --> 19:21.975
in a special part
of the hospital.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.311
You mean he's really sick?

19:24.330 --> 19:25.646
You fix people.

19:25.665 --> 19:29.667
-You'll fix him,
can't you, Daddy?
-Spencer.

19:29.818 --> 19:32.086
I'll be right there.

19:33.898 --> 19:36.990
What's happening?
His daddy is scared.

19:37.010 --> 19:39.218
You have to save Peter.

19:42.907 --> 19:44.907
I got him.

19:44.926 --> 19:46.392
I got him, I promise.

19:51.432 --> 19:52.932
(Spencer sighs)

19:53.008 --> 19:54.192
He seems much worse.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.843
Please tell me
you have some news.

19:56.938 --> 19:58.178
We gave him another round
of meds

19:58.272 --> 20:00.013
to lower
the intracranial pressure,

20:00.033 --> 20:03.701
but it'll take time...
if it works.

20:06.355 --> 20:09.031
He was hurting,
and I totally missed it.

20:10.284 --> 20:13.336
I get guilt, believe me,
but it is not earned here.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.866
Help him. Please.

20:19.961 --> 20:23.370
We're doing everything we can.

20:23.464 --> 20:25.056
Uh, just...

20:25.283 --> 20:28.041
I don't want anybody
cutting his head open.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.376
Not if we can avoid it.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.062
Understood.

20:36.627 --> 20:37.526
You all right?

20:39.313 --> 20:41.647
Now<i> I</i> feel guilty,
about how lucky I am

20:41.799 --> 20:43.241
not to be in Spencer's shoes.

20:43.468 --> 20:44.891
Peter has to make it
through this.

20:44.986 --> 20:46.969
-I know.
-And Gigi, she lost her mother.

20:46.988 --> 20:47.987
She can't lose her best friend.

20:48.155 --> 20:49.080
We have to make sure
they both come

20:49.307 --> 20:50.322
-out of this.
-(retching)

20:50.458 --> 20:52.458
Uh, Dr. Hawkins!

20:55.404 --> 20:59.257
Vomiting means his intracranial
pressure must be rising.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.927
I'm a little confused.

21:03.078 --> 21:04.411
-I'm sorry.
-So the metoprolol

21:04.505 --> 21:05.654
helped your heart,

21:05.673 --> 21:07.265
but it also lowered
your blood pressure.

21:07.492 --> 21:08.991
ZACH:
And with all the water pills
you were on,

21:09.010 --> 21:10.268
plus the stimulants,
your heart rate sped

21:10.495 --> 21:12.937
and BP lowered, which caused you
to lose consciousness.

21:13.164 --> 21:14.830
Other doctors have been
telling me

21:14.923 --> 21:17.349
that these meds are saving
my life, and you're telling me

21:17.502 --> 21:19.926
-the opposite?
-No, just listen to them, hon.

21:19.946 --> 21:23.188
They want to take you off
medications you may not need,

21:23.341 --> 21:25.024
and-and keep you on
ones that are working.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.342
But we'd like to keep you here

21:26.360 --> 21:28.119
to monitor you
while we do it.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.937
But it's just for a day,
and then, um, you'll go home.

21:31.032 --> 21:34.517
-There's hope for him yet.
-Mm.

21:34.519 --> 21:36.109
Thank you both.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.704
We've given Peter
the maximum doses,

21:38.856 --> 21:41.281
but he's... he's not improving.

21:41.375 --> 21:42.949
Well, time to book an OR.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.469
No, let's just... (exhales)

21:45.621 --> 21:46.971
...start with a drain

21:47.122 --> 21:49.181
before you open his head.

21:52.628 --> 21:54.103
Okay, we can try it.

21:55.873 --> 21:58.149
I'll get an EVD monitor.

22:01.212 --> 22:04.046
-Talk to me.
-We're putting in a drain.

22:04.065 --> 22:06.657
It should help relieve
the pressure on his brain.

22:06.809 --> 22:08.284
It's a first step.

22:11.164 --> 22:14.540
I don't know how much longer
we can put off a craniectomy.

22:16.610 --> 22:18.419
It's my son.

22:22.233 --> 22:24.008
Let's take everything
one step at a time.

22:24.159 --> 22:27.845
Right now, we need to sedate
and intubate,

22:28.072 --> 22:30.573
and to protect his airway.

22:30.591 --> 22:34.093
I have to talk to him first,
before you, before you...

22:34.245 --> 22:37.271
Of course.
Of course.

22:45.423 --> 22:47.848
Hey, bud.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.941
(sighs)

22:49.035 --> 22:52.778
I just want you to know...

22:52.930 --> 22:57.023
I want you to know that
every second that you're asleep,

22:57.043 --> 22:59.860
I'm gonna be
right here beside you.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.296
Deal?

23:07.387 --> 23:08.869
Okay.

23:08.963 --> 23:10.346
(exhales sharply)

23:26.722 --> 23:28.572
Hey, there she is.

23:28.724 --> 23:30.466
So, how'd it go this morning?

23:30.484 --> 23:35.228
The hormone shot was fine,
but this is not. Look.

23:35.322 --> 23:36.897
Padma picked a donor,
but I did a little bit

23:36.991 --> 23:38.249
of digging
into this sperm bank.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.084
It's facing three lawsuits
from families who claim

23:40.235 --> 23:42.828
their donors misrepresented
themselves.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.313
In one case,
the family alleged

23:44.331 --> 23:46.090
that the donor had
an undisclosed history

23:46.317 --> 23:47.091
of schizophrenia.

23:47.318 --> 23:48.241
In another,

23:48.261 --> 23:50.152
a donor covered up
a criminal record.

23:50.171 --> 23:52.988
Some claim college degrees
when they're really dropouts.

23:53.007 --> 23:54.414
These families were lied to.

23:54.434 --> 23:57.435
Yes. About the biggest decision
they'll ever make.

23:57.586 --> 23:59.270
The genes their kids
will share with its father.

23:59.421 --> 24:02.589
Yeah, but, I mean,
this is just

24:02.667 --> 24:04.608
a few cases
out of how many, right?

24:04.760 --> 24:06.001
I mean, I had a lot of friends

24:06.170 --> 24:07.427
in med school who donated.
They were good guys,

24:07.447 --> 24:09.004
they just needed cash;
they wanted to help.

24:09.097 --> 24:10.689
Is this your way of saying

24:10.783 --> 24:12.950
there are little Devons
out there?

24:13.101 --> 24:16.178
If it helps, every single one
of these donors

24:16.271 --> 24:17.846
had to undergo genetic testing.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.683
There is no test to show whether
you're a pathological liar,

24:20.701 --> 24:22.293
have a mental illness
or a criminal record.

24:22.444 --> 24:24.203
-And you're missing the point.
-No, I get it.

24:24.279 --> 24:25.204
Sperm banks are unregulated.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.280
The FDA requires
that donors are tested

24:27.300 --> 24:30.617
for infectious diseases,
but beyond that, nothing.

24:30.636 --> 24:32.377
Their bios aren't even verified.

24:32.530 --> 24:33.787
That may work for some people.

24:33.881 --> 24:35.547
There are amazing kids out there
from anonymous donors,

24:35.700 --> 24:36.790
but that won't work for me.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.124
-This is my egg.
-Hey, babe...

24:38.293 --> 24:42.295
You have to accept
that this is Padma's choice.

24:43.374 --> 24:45.874
Well, I need to make sure
she knows what she's choosing.

24:45.893 --> 24:48.652
(pager vibrating, beeping)

24:48.804 --> 24:49.820
(scoffs)

24:49.989 --> 24:52.448
We'll talk later, okay?

24:57.663 --> 24:59.054
-Are you hot or cold?
-Both.

24:59.147 --> 25:00.146
Okay, don't worry,
we're gonna help you.

25:00.166 --> 25:02.148
She's in A-fib and hypotensive.

25:02.226 --> 25:03.834
A-fib could be because we took
her off metoprolol.

25:04.061 --> 25:05.227
Let me check
if her pressure dropped

25:05.246 --> 25:06.337
before she slipped
into arrhythmia.

25:06.488 --> 25:08.080
I-I was here. Her BP started
to fall first,

25:08.232 --> 25:09.732
then her heart rate spiked.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.008
Peritonitis?

25:11.159 --> 25:13.660
-Gloria, tell me where it hurts.
-(groans, cries out)

25:13.679 --> 25:16.071
-Rebound tenderness.
-This has nothing to do
with the meds.

25:16.164 --> 25:17.406
She has an acute abdomen
and she may need surgery.

25:17.499 --> 25:19.742
Let's get her
four of morphine.

25:19.760 --> 25:20.684
Hang pressors and page Bell.

25:20.877 --> 25:23.503
Hey, hang in there, okay?

25:23.597 --> 25:25.439
(gasps)

25:29.695 --> 25:31.011
Where to begin?

25:31.105 --> 25:33.531
Gloria has three lumbar
compression fractures

25:33.682 --> 25:34.698
from osteoporosis.

25:34.925 --> 25:37.017
And a hiatal hernia.
All incidental findings.

25:37.111 --> 25:38.427
Consequence of living
for eight decades.

25:38.520 --> 25:42.022
So here's today's problem.
Colonic perforation.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.098
No wonder she was
in so much pain.

25:43.117 --> 25:44.266
And no idea what caused this?

25:44.285 --> 25:46.285
It couldn't have been
the fall.

25:46.437 --> 25:47.770
We thought she passed out
from too many meds,

25:47.863 --> 25:49.288
but something else was going on.
We just don't know what.

25:49.440 --> 25:52.365
Well, what we do know
is that without surgery,

25:52.459 --> 25:53.884
Gloria won't make it.

25:54.036 --> 25:56.554
You're talking about a surgery
that's dangerous at any age,

25:56.705 --> 25:58.280
and with Gloria nearly 80...

25:58.449 --> 26:00.783
Well, we'll be sure to be
very clear with her

26:00.801 --> 26:02.542
about what we're facing here.

26:02.562 --> 26:05.729
But I agree with you.
It's the only option.

26:05.922 --> 26:08.381
Okay. At least
she's in the best hands.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.809
Well, I've had success
with patients older than her,

26:10.961 --> 26:12.127
much sicker.

26:12.146 --> 26:14.363
I really hope she's one of them.

26:19.227 --> 26:19.985
So you think "The Right Stuff"
is secretly

26:20.228 --> 26:21.728
-some sort of axe murderer?
-No.

26:21.822 --> 26:22.988
I'm just saying we can't

26:23.140 --> 26:24.990
-really be sure who he is.
-Okay, look,

26:25.142 --> 26:26.917
I really appreciate
you being protective of me,

26:27.069 --> 26:28.977
but there's no guarantees
with kids.

26:28.996 --> 26:30.254
I mean, look at us.

26:30.481 --> 26:31.663
What, there's
a one-in-a-million chance

26:31.816 --> 26:32.831
of having twins?

26:32.983 --> 26:34.666
One in 250.

26:34.743 --> 26:37.911
And we are proof that
a random genetic accident

26:37.988 --> 26:39.655
can be the best gift ever.

26:39.673 --> 26:42.749
Look, I can't give up
on being a mother

26:42.827 --> 26:43.750
just because there's risks.

26:43.844 --> 26:45.102
I don't want you to.

26:45.329 --> 26:47.587
I just want you to be aware
of what those risks are.

26:47.607 --> 26:52.351
Which is why I asked
Dr. Nolan to join us.

26:52.445 --> 26:53.593
What's up, ladies?

26:53.613 --> 26:55.337
Show her what you showed me.

26:55.356 --> 26:56.447
Oh.

26:59.193 --> 27:00.525
PADMA:
"Dream Doc"?

27:00.678 --> 27:02.694
I don't understand.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.455
-It's him.
-It's me.

27:05.941 --> 27:07.440
You're six-foot five?

27:07.460 --> 27:09.201
I do slouch some.

27:09.353 --> 27:10.628
And fluent in French?

27:10.779 --> 27:12.020
Yeah.

27:12.114 --> 27:14.089
(bad accent):
<i> Je suis</i> Rosetta Stone.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.026
-Trombone prodigy?
-I got a standing ovation

27:18.045 --> 27:19.637
at my ninth grade recital.

27:19.788 --> 27:21.713
(pager beeping)

27:21.790 --> 27:24.391
-Just think about it.
-Mm.

27:25.961 --> 27:27.886
Think about what?

27:28.038 --> 27:31.464
Surgery?
Sounds... dangerous.

27:31.484 --> 27:34.134
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.
It is.

27:34.153 --> 27:37.804
But it is the only option.

27:37.898 --> 27:42.384
And without it,
you may only have days.

27:42.403 --> 27:43.476
Maybe a week.

27:43.570 --> 27:46.054
I'm sorry.

27:46.073 --> 27:48.832
Y-You always say how

27:49.059 --> 27:52.169
e-easy choices are
your favorite.

27:53.564 --> 27:57.174
I wish I could offer you
more time

27:57.401 --> 27:58.992
to make this decision.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.903
But the sooner you operate,

28:00.921 --> 28:03.430
the better my chances are?

28:06.911 --> 28:09.002
Well, then, I'm ready.

28:09.021 --> 28:12.672
Arthur, I'm sure everybody
over at Brookhaven is worried.

28:12.766 --> 28:14.841
You think maybe you could
go call them

28:14.935 --> 28:17.436
-and fill them in?
-Oh, of course.

28:17.530 --> 28:18.862
Any-Anything, darling.

28:19.089 --> 28:20.923
Yes, Brookhaven.

28:21.016 --> 28:22.941
Update, update Brookhaven.

28:23.093 --> 28:26.370
Update Brookhaven.

28:26.597 --> 28:27.763
(sighs)

28:27.781 --> 28:29.022
I can't leave him.

28:29.116 --> 28:31.375
-He needs me.
-Oh, I...

28:31.526 --> 28:33.210
I get it.

28:33.361 --> 28:37.363
You have got to be better
than you have ever been.

28:38.125 --> 28:40.776
Neither one of us
have children.

28:40.869 --> 28:42.945
(sniffles)
Not even siblings.

28:42.963 --> 28:45.038
It's just the two of us.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.282
He has no one else.

28:47.301 --> 28:49.284
I have no one else.

28:50.471 --> 28:52.896
Do you know what it's like
to find the love of your life

28:53.065 --> 28:56.400
this late in the game?

28:56.477 --> 28:59.052
Actually, I do.

28:59.146 --> 29:01.630
And when the day comes,

29:01.723 --> 29:03.890
and he forgets my name,

29:03.984 --> 29:06.392
I won't even care.

29:06.561 --> 29:10.748
I'll fill in that blank,
'cause he'll still love me.

29:11.900 --> 29:13.399
And I'll love him.

29:13.419 --> 29:15.753
To the end.

29:15.904 --> 29:19.298
Just don't let it be today.

29:20.742 --> 29:22.426
Okay.

29:24.989 --> 29:27.389
(monitor beeping)

29:32.012 --> 29:34.679
His intracranial pressure
is still rising,

29:34.774 --> 29:36.681
and we're not sure
of the cause.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.591
The MRI didn't show
any tumors

29:38.611 --> 29:41.612
or blood clots in his brain.

29:41.839 --> 29:42.946
So what does this mean?

29:43.098 --> 29:44.764
That the drain wasn't enough.

29:44.858 --> 29:46.858
Mr. Shafer,
we have no choice but to

29:47.011 --> 29:48.176
proceed with the craniectomy

29:48.195 --> 29:49.769
to relieve the pressure
in Peter's brain.

29:49.863 --> 29:51.497
My God.

29:53.867 --> 29:55.367
I can't believe
this is happening.

29:55.519 --> 29:57.536
There must be something else
you can do.

29:57.688 --> 30:01.039
If we wait any longer,
he's at risk of brain damage.

30:01.191 --> 30:03.191
Treat him like he's your child.

30:03.285 --> 30:08.096
Would you agree to this
if it was Gigi?

30:12.052 --> 30:14.311
Spencer, give us a minute
to review.

30:18.133 --> 30:21.209
-Tell me there's another option.
-There isn't.

30:21.228 --> 30:23.153
What he just said in there
won't help Peter.

30:23.380 --> 30:26.048
Keeping your objectivity will.
You have to.

30:26.066 --> 30:27.473
I'm sorry to interrupt,

30:27.493 --> 30:29.493
but the preschool's been trying
to get in touch.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.745
Gigi needs you.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.750
Do what you have to do
to reduce the swelling.

30:46.737 --> 30:48.236
Hey. She's been like this

30:48.330 --> 30:49.588
since Peter left
this morning.

30:49.664 --> 30:52.432
She won't eat or talk.

30:53.093 --> 30:55.477
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.528
What is that?

31:04.679 --> 31:07.105
A space helmet for Peter.

31:07.257 --> 31:11.034
If he goes into space,
he can't die.

31:12.763 --> 31:16.039
Is he gonna die, like Mommy?

31:20.862 --> 31:23.255
(sighs)

31:25.867 --> 31:28.944
I'm fighting for Peter.

31:28.962 --> 31:31.780
-I'm scared.
-I know. That's okay.

31:31.798 --> 31:33.223
I knew he was sick when

31:33.375 --> 31:35.541
he didn't want to eat
my sandwich.

31:35.594 --> 31:39.287
We trade. He always
eats my sandwich.

31:39.289 --> 31:41.881
When his mommy left,
his daddy started

31:41.901 --> 31:45.385
making his lunch
with roast beef.

31:45.404 --> 31:49.364
After he ate it all,
his tummy started hurting.

31:55.397 --> 31:57.247
Did he eat your sandwich
this morning?

31:57.474 --> 31:59.249
No, Daddy.

32:06.833 --> 32:08.717
Craniotome to me.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.098
I've done this a hundred times,
but rarely on a child.

32:15.250 --> 32:19.144
You're more than qualified.

32:21.331 --> 32:23.832
Watch for bleeding,
be gentle.

32:23.925 --> 32:26.193
When I pass through bone,
I stop.

32:26.928 --> 32:30.338
Now, let's get started.

32:30.432 --> 32:31.673
(whirring)

32:31.766 --> 32:32.857
Wait!

32:33.010 --> 32:34.284
I think Peter has
urea cycle disorder.

32:34.511 --> 32:36.769
It's a genetic enzyme deficiency
that makes it hard

32:36.789 --> 32:38.363
for people to break down
protein.

32:38.457 --> 32:41.107
Whenever Spencer packs his son
roast beef, he trades it away

32:41.276 --> 32:42.701
because it makes
his stomach hurt.

32:42.853 --> 32:43.776
I think sharing his dad's

32:43.796 --> 32:45.187
protein shake this morning

32:45.280 --> 32:47.022
gave him more protein
than he could process,

32:47.191 --> 32:48.448
and his body was already under
stress from his recent cold.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.968
Talk about a zebra.
Urea cycle is extremely rare.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.377
But it would explain
all the symptoms.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.953
Let's get him back
to the ICU,

32:53.973 --> 32:55.973
start him on dialysis,
clear the ammonia.

32:56.200 --> 32:57.307
Yeah, but do we have
that kind of time?

32:57.459 --> 32:59.309
The odds you're right
are vanishingly small,

32:59.461 --> 33:00.644
and if you're wrong,
this boy's brain

33:00.871 --> 33:01.961
continues to swell,

33:01.981 --> 33:03.271
which will cause him
permanent damage.

33:05.133 --> 33:06.299
We need to operate now.

33:06.393 --> 33:08.134
CONRAD:
A craniectomy is a gamble, too.

33:08.228 --> 33:09.728
At the rate the swelling
is worsening,

33:09.804 --> 33:11.896
best-case scenario, what,
it buys Peter days?

33:12.049 --> 33:14.566
It doesn't fix the problem.

33:14.718 --> 33:16.159
That is true.

33:17.830 --> 33:20.405
So let's do both.

33:20.557 --> 33:23.316
Dialysis right here.
We can watch his ICP.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.577
If it doesn't drop,
I'm ready to

33:25.729 --> 33:27.129
start a crani immediately.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.166
I'll be right here
when you wake up.

33:40.227 --> 33:44.312
Okay, this is as far
as you can go.

33:52.013 --> 33:54.439
I love you.

33:54.608 --> 33:57.701
I love you more.

33:57.928 --> 34:00.412
(chuckles)

34:02.857 --> 34:04.332
Okay.

34:20.634 --> 34:23.185
Wire, please.

34:29.309 --> 34:31.276
Dilator.

34:35.799 --> 34:38.408
All right, we're almost there.

34:38.635 --> 34:40.243
All right, catheter in.

34:40.470 --> 34:42.913
If you're right,
the pressure should trend down

34:43.064 --> 34:44.322
once the proteins are
filtered out.

34:44.474 --> 34:46.541
Yeah, well, it's not gonna
happen immediately.

34:51.998 --> 34:53.465
If that number doesn't
come down soon, I start.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.094
Whether I want to or not.

35:00.006 --> 35:02.324
We're working through
some unexpected adhesions.

35:02.417 --> 35:04.843
Did Gloria mention anything
about prior surgeries?

35:04.995 --> 35:07.011
<i> None. Any sign</i>
<i> of the perforation?</i>

35:07.088 --> 35:08.254
Running the bowel now.

35:08.273 --> 35:11.349
There's no sign of
widespread ischemia.

35:11.501 --> 35:12.109
Oh, there it is.

35:12.260 --> 35:13.276
Can you repair it?

35:13.428 --> 35:15.112
Well, the surrounding bowel
is thickened

35:15.339 --> 35:18.340
with extensive lymphadenopathy.

35:18.433 --> 35:20.784
It sounds like
whatever's going on

35:20.935 --> 35:22.101
caused significant inflammation.

35:22.195 --> 35:24.121
I should be able
to repair the perf,

35:24.348 --> 35:26.030
but, you know,
this didn't happen overnight.

35:26.125 --> 35:27.607
It's been going on for years.

35:27.684 --> 35:30.185
Bowel inflammation is
extremely painful.

35:30.203 --> 35:33.046
Her daily steroids
must have been masking it.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.466
See the big picture.

35:36.618 --> 35:38.360
Dr. Kravitz told me
in geriatrics

35:38.378 --> 35:40.971
you always gotta keep your eye
on the big picture.

35:41.198 --> 35:43.289
What if the arthritis
and the bowel inflammation

35:43.308 --> 35:44.808
are all part of the same
disease process?

35:45.035 --> 35:47.269
It's possible.

35:48.388 --> 35:50.221
If the side effects
of her medications

35:50.315 --> 35:54.234
were actually symptoms of
the underlying issue.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.562
We've been looking at this
all wrong.

35:57.714 --> 36:00.215
Let's get back
to Gloria's prescriptions

36:00.308 --> 36:01.641
and see if we can't
get her some answers

36:01.660 --> 36:03.451
when she wakes up.

36:06.390 --> 36:07.922
BILLIE:
It just keeps rising.

36:07.924 --> 36:09.332
Can we dialyze faster?

36:09.409 --> 36:11.893
Any faster and his neurons
could shear from diffusion.

36:11.912 --> 36:13.152
Just give it a minute.

36:13.246 --> 36:14.504
Conrad, this is the brain.
A minute can be

36:14.731 --> 36:15.821
the difference between
life and death.

36:15.916 --> 36:17.065
Just give me one more minute.

36:17.158 --> 36:18.341
We don't have
good choices here.

36:18.568 --> 36:21.344
-Billie, we're on the same side.
-But this is my OR.

36:31.431 --> 36:33.005
(monitor beeps)

36:33.025 --> 36:35.108
-It dropped.
-Wait, Dr. Sutton.

36:36.253 --> 36:38.111
That number's still
dangerously high.

36:46.596 --> 36:48.279
(monitor beeps)

36:48.432 --> 36:49.998
(laughs)

36:52.769 --> 36:54.753
It worked.

36:57.532 --> 36:58.698
(exhales sharply)

36:58.866 --> 37:01.292
JESSICA:
You ready to close?

37:01.445 --> 37:04.346
Sure am.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.804
Focus on that still space

37:12.956 --> 37:15.881
between our inhale

37:15.959 --> 37:18.401
and our exhale.

37:18.553 --> 37:19.811
(phone chimes)

37:19.963 --> 37:21.646
Please remember
to silence your devices

37:21.740 --> 37:23.389
before we begin the class.

37:23.483 --> 37:25.700
(phone chimes)

37:27.487 --> 37:29.329
(phone chimes)

37:32.734 --> 37:34.459
(pager beeps)

37:50.327 --> 37:52.251
-I seem to have gotten
turned around.
-Okay.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.845
My wife is in surgery.

37:53.997 --> 37:55.755
Can you direct me
to the waiting room?

37:55.849 --> 37:58.316
Uh, here, let me show you.

38:00.928 --> 38:03.095
The cavalry has arrived.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.005
77-year-old woman
with a bowel perf.

38:04.024 --> 38:05.264
Pressure started tanking.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.616
At first I thought
it was peritonitis,

38:06.768 --> 38:08.676
then I saw her neck.

38:08.678 --> 38:09.786
I need ultrasound now.

38:10.013 --> 38:11.437
Any idea why
she might be in tamponade?

38:11.456 --> 38:13.105
No idea what the underlying
issue is.

38:13.125 --> 38:15.350
Right now, we just need
to get her off the table.

38:15.443 --> 38:17.443
Start another epi
and bolus a liter.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.871
There's fluid around her heart.
We need to prep her

38:19.965 --> 38:21.205
for pericardiocentesis.

38:21.300 --> 38:22.966
Okay, I'll finish up
so I can assist.

38:23.117 --> 38:24.208
All right, but if
she doesn't stabilize, Bell,

38:24.361 --> 38:25.710
I'm gonna have
to crack her chest open.

38:25.862 --> 38:28.263
Oh, God, let's hope not.

38:41.545 --> 38:43.878
Oh, man, I can't wait
to tell 'em.

38:43.971 --> 38:45.322
Hey, we figured it out.

38:45.473 --> 38:47.306
Gloria's medications
didn't cause her problems,

38:47.433 --> 38:48.842
but they masked
an underlying one:

38:48.844 --> 38:50.309
Whipple's disease.

38:50.329 --> 38:52.554
That's what caused her
arthritis, weight loss, fatigue.

38:52.572 --> 38:54.814
And steroids that her doctors
first thought was arthritis

38:54.908 --> 38:56.148
only made it worse.

38:56.242 --> 38:57.909
She told us that
they increased her dose,

38:58.061 --> 38:59.169
leading to the perf.

38:59.320 --> 39:00.503
ZACH: Now all Gloria needs
is an antibiotic.

39:00.655 --> 39:01.838
We can take her off of

39:01.989 --> 39:03.898
-almost everything else.
-She didn't make it.

39:03.917 --> 39:06.843
-I'm sorry.
-What? She...

39:07.070 --> 39:09.995
BELL:
She developed cardiac tamponade,

39:10.090 --> 39:12.407
which was probably
the final complication

39:12.576 --> 39:14.075
of her undiagnosed Whipple.

39:14.094 --> 39:16.594
And Austin was working to place
a pericardial drain

39:16.688 --> 39:18.521
when she coded.

39:18.673 --> 39:21.099
We did five rounds of CPR.

39:21.193 --> 39:23.751
More than I should have
on a woman her age.

39:23.753 --> 39:25.195
It was a tough one.

39:25.364 --> 39:26.863
BELL:
Now, if she'd been
treated properly,

39:27.014 --> 39:28.180
or if she'd gotten
to us sooner,

39:28.316 --> 39:30.758
maybe we could have
done something

39:30.777 --> 39:31.868
to turn it around.

39:32.095 --> 39:35.330
But today...
it was just far too late.

39:37.601 --> 39:39.292
Dr. Kravitz...

39:41.863 --> 39:43.621
Kit is his friend,

39:43.715 --> 39:46.549
so I will call her
to tell him.

39:57.545 --> 39:59.729
DEVON: Even if we had
diagnosed her sooner,

39:59.881 --> 40:01.973
Gloria's disease began
years ago.

40:02.125 --> 40:03.382
There's nothing
we could have done.

40:03.402 --> 40:06.903
Gloria wasn't just another
fragile old lady.

40:07.054 --> 40:09.964
She was strong, in love.

40:10.057 --> 40:12.575
She deserved more time.

40:12.727 --> 40:17.305
But every doctor looked at her
like just another lost cause.

40:17.398 --> 40:18.990
No one cared enough to see

40:19.084 --> 40:20.992
that by just treating
her symptoms,

40:21.144 --> 40:23.420
they were actually
making her worse.

40:28.260 --> 40:32.429
No one saw the bigger picture
until you did.

40:34.582 --> 40:37.825
Reconsider going into
gerontology, Zach.

40:37.844 --> 40:39.978

Hey.

So we'll continue dialysis until
we lower his ammonia levels,

41:37.478 --> 41:38.495

-That put the fear of God in me.
-Yeah, I bet.

42:36.796 --> 42:39.130
But the eggs are gonna be
retrieved in about two weeks,

You could do worse.

42:58.726 --> 43:01.152

43:01.228 --> 43:04.539
