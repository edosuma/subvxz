WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:03.233
All right, which do you
think is cooler for my date?

00:03.233 --> 00:05.567
Leather jacket
or this hoodie?

00:05.567 --> 00:07.967
Let's see.

00:07.967 --> 00:11.500
Nice leather, or...

00:11.500 --> 00:13.567
...what if we...

00:13.567 --> 00:15.133
Good.

00:15.133 --> 00:17.367
[exclaims]

00:17.367 --> 00:19.000
Yep, I'd go with the hoodie.

00:20.033 --> 00:22.600
Take it easy.
I'm a mouth-breather.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.000
[exhales]

00:25.000 --> 00:28.900
I can't believe you
let your WizTech buddies
set you up on a blind date,

00:28.900 --> 00:32.600
and all you know from her
is what you've learned from
her profile on WizFace.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.767
You haven't even
seen her. She's hot.

00:34.767 --> 00:36.700
And she's into all the
same things I'm into.

00:36.700 --> 00:39.867
Please. Listen,
everybody's hot on WizFace.

00:39.867 --> 00:42.900
They don't show their real
picture, and lie about
what they're into.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.734
What picture did
she see of you?

00:44.734 --> 00:47.734
Oh, I don't think pictures
really capture my essence.

00:47.734 --> 00:50.900
That's why I
posted a complicated
mathematical equation.

00:52.300 --> 00:53.867
Come check it out.

00:53.867 --> 00:57.100
[computer beeps]

00:57.100 --> 01:00.200
Oh. I get it. Because you're
hard to figure out

01:00.200 --> 01:01.967
nobody cares
enough to try.

01:01.967 --> 01:03.667
[sarcastic laugh]

01:03.667 --> 01:07.500
What other embarrassing
things do you have on
your embarrassing page?

01:07.500 --> 01:12.100
Oh my gosh. I can't believe
you posted that picture with
you and that centaur.

01:12.100 --> 01:15.100
[chuckles] Don't you wish she'd
told you she was half horse
and half girl

01:15.100 --> 01:17.867
before you asked her
to WizTech Prom?

01:17.867 --> 01:20.600
I saved a lot
on a limo.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.600
I'm just saying people,
or horses,

01:24.600 --> 01:26.967
are not always honest
on WizFace.

01:26.967 --> 01:28.100
[doorbell rings]

01:28.100 --> 01:29.767
OK, that's Isabella now.

01:29.767 --> 01:33.600
I guarantee you
she looks exactly like
her picture on WizFace.

01:33.600 --> 01:34.600
[clears throat]

01:34.600 --> 01:38.200
Is this the Russo residence?

01:42.900 --> 01:44.600
Hi.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.600
Here's your floral wristlet.

01:49.033 --> 01:50.567
Thanks.

01:50.567 --> 01:53.600
And here's some mail that came
to my apartment by accident.

01:56.734 --> 01:58.700
Oh, ma'am?
[chuckles]

01:58.700 --> 02:01.000
Take it easy.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.667
- Whew.
- Ah!

02:04.667 --> 02:09.100
I wouldn't "whew" so fast.
At least that lady
only had two legs.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.834
[doorbell rings]

02:10.834 --> 02:12.734
OK. I'm sure Isabella's normal.

02:12.734 --> 02:14.834
Oh! Forgot the floral wristlet.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.200
Hi, I'm Isabella.
Is Justin here?

02:22.200 --> 02:25.200
Oh, well you're cute.
Boo.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.500
Justin?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.567
Isabella?

02:32.834 --> 02:38.300
Wow, you're even prettier
than your pictures on WizFace.

02:38.300 --> 02:43.300
And you don't look anything like
"X equals Y squared
over cosine of pi."

02:43.300 --> 02:45.600
I know. Everyone says that.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.000
So nice to meet you.
And even nicer for
you to meet Alex,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.734
who thinks she
knows everything.

02:52.467 --> 02:55.900
Here, take a seat.
I'll go get you some of
your favorite Diet WizFizz.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.100
You know, the soda?

02:57.100 --> 02:59.667
I remembered
from your profile.

03:02.567 --> 03:06.300
Well, this was fun.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.500
Can you pass me
that sweater, please?

03:09.500 --> 03:11.200
[growling]

03:17.834 --> 03:19.567
OK.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.000
[growling]

03:22.000 --> 03:23.600
[barks]

03:23.600 --> 03:26.700
Now that was fun.

03:28.200 --> 03:29.934

was "awkward."

04:24.700 --> 04:26.734
Hey, Alfred. Are you ready
to go walk the dog?

04:26.734 --> 04:29.033
I don't know. There are
a lot of streets to cross

04:29.033 --> 04:33.100
between here and the park,
where a lot could go wrong.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.033
Hey, Mom, we're going
to walk the dog in the park.

04:36.033 --> 04:39.200
All right, honey.
Wait, wait, wait.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.767
We don't own a dog.

04:40.767 --> 04:43.834
This is Tucker,
Mrs. Covington's dog.

04:43.834 --> 04:46.000
She's gonna give us
five bucks a day to walk him.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.100
We're saving up to buy
those cups-on-a-chain

04:48.100 --> 04:50.667
so we won't have to keep
asking you guys for cups.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.700
Oh, you know, honey, it's really
not that much of a bother.

04:53.700 --> 04:56.834
We own a restaurant,
we've got hundreds of cups.

04:56.834 --> 05:00.233
We want cups-on-a-chain.
Are you in or are you out?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.767
All right, all right.
I guess I'm in.

05:02.767 --> 05:05.400
You know what? I'm gonna
bake some dog biscuits

05:05.400 --> 05:09.400
from a recipe I saw
on Dog Food Network. OK?

05:09.400 --> 05:12.033
Why do we want
cups-on-a-chain again?

05:12.033 --> 05:14.967
How many times has someone
offered you a beverage

05:14.967 --> 05:17.200
and you have nothing
to put it in?

05:17.200 --> 05:19.000
Never.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.834
Well, it'll never
happen again.

05:25.467 --> 05:28.867
Oh, hi. Are you
one of Alex's friends?

05:28.867 --> 05:31.100
No, Dad. She's with me.
[nervous laugh]

05:31.100 --> 05:33.767
A pretty girl
can be with me.

05:33.767 --> 05:38.367
Oh, right. Of course.

05:38.367 --> 05:42.233
I'm Isabella.
You must be Mr. Russo.

05:42.233 --> 05:43.300
Hi.

05:44.967 --> 05:47.300
Oh, hi. I'll get Alex.

05:48.767 --> 05:50.233
Theresa, please.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.934
A pretty girl
can be with Justin.

05:51.934 --> 05:55.033
Oh, of course.

05:55.033 --> 05:56.900
Justin and I were
set up by friends

05:56.900 --> 05:59.233
and we've been getting
to know each other on WizFace.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.800
WizFace. Really?

06:01.800 --> 06:05.300
Oh, yeah. I hear it's a fun,
social networking site

06:05.300 --> 06:06.967
where people from
the wizard world who

06:06.967 --> 06:09.867
don't know each other at all
can get to know each other.

06:11.900 --> 06:13.100
Can you come
in the kitchen?

06:13.100 --> 06:14.900
We need help with
the salami slicing.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.700
It's Max's turn for that.

06:16.700 --> 06:20.100
- Well, we need your help
with something else.
- [whispers] Yeah.

06:20.100 --> 06:23.834
- What?
- That thing.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.900
What thing?

06:25.900 --> 06:28.600
Justin, get in
the kitchen right now.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.467
All right. Come on, Isabella,
we're going in the kitchen.

06:31.467 --> 06:35.233
No, no! No, no. No, no,
Isabella needs to stay here, uh,

06:35.233 --> 06:37.967
because, um,
because of that thing.

06:37.967 --> 06:40.000
That thing with the...
Oh, what are we doing?

06:40.000 --> 06:42.834
Isabella, you stay here.
Justin, come on.

06:55.567 --> 06:58.834
Oh... Hi, Alex.

07:00.100 --> 07:01.700
I saw that.

07:02.800 --> 07:03.867
Saw what?

07:03.867 --> 07:06.400
I'm not sure what I saw,
but I saw that.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.467
Once again, we have
to discuss WizFace

07:12.467 --> 07:16.200
and how dangerous it is
because you never really
know who you're dealing with.

07:16.200 --> 07:20.300
And how you keep buying stuff
on the World Wide Wizard Web
that you don't need.

07:20.300 --> 07:23.600
Like the Submarine-
part-of-the-month Club?

07:23.600 --> 07:26.233
I know it seems
ridiculous right now,

07:26.233 --> 07:30.600
but in a 128,000 months,
I'll have a complete submarine.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.100
[sighs]

07:32.100 --> 07:35.600
And there's nothing
wrong with Isabella.
She's really nice.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.967
Well, at least this one's
not half horse.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.934
That centaur looked
beautiful in her prom dress.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.467
Honey, you are
missing the point.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.000
You didn't know
she was a centaur
before you met her.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.967
She ate all the carrots
in the sub shop.

07:50.967 --> 07:54.000
Our coleslaw was
flavorless for a week.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.600
Mom, Dad, I hear what you're
saying right now,

07:56.600 --> 07:59.400
but I think I'm
old enough to make
my own decisions.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.200
All right. Just do yourself
a favor

08:01.200 --> 08:04.400
and get to know her better
before you get serious.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.233
Don't worry. It's gonna be fine.
I'm going on a date with her.

08:07.233 --> 08:11.100
Everything's gonna be OK.
Look at her. She's fine.

08:13.734 --> 08:16.233
[chuckles] Hey.

08:16.233 --> 08:19.200
She totally just heard
everything we said.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.600
We should really shut this
when we're talking about people,

08:21.600 --> 08:23.700
and they're sitting right there.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.000
So, uh, where are
you guys going again?

08:29.000 --> 08:31.100
I'm taking Isabella
for a walk in the park.

08:31.100 --> 08:33.500
Oh. She'll like that.

08:46.967 --> 08:48.367
Hello! Hello!

08:48.367 --> 08:49.767
Hello! Hello!

08:49.767 --> 08:51.600
Hello! Hello!

08:51.600 --> 08:53.033
[squirrel chitters]

08:53.033 --> 08:54.600
Squirrel!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.734
[growling]

08:58.734 --> 09:00.834
[squirrel chitters]

09:00.834 --> 09:03.000
You see I almost
caught that squirrel?

09:03.000 --> 09:06.934
And that bus. And that cab.
And the guy on the bike.

09:06.934 --> 09:08.667
You almost caught
a lot of things.

09:08.667 --> 09:11.400
I know. Isn't this
the best walk ever?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.900
Yeah. I just thought
we'd walk together.

09:13.900 --> 09:16.567
Oh, OK. Let's walk
together.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.233
And listen, if I ever
get out of sight,

09:18.233 --> 09:19.967
all you have
to do is whistle.

09:19.967 --> 09:23.700
Hot. I like it.

09:23.700 --> 09:26.000
Can you believe
my sister and my parents

09:26.000 --> 09:28.467
think we don't know enough
about each other to go out?

09:28.467 --> 09:31.900
I know. I can tell from
your profile that we're
into all the same things,

09:31.900 --> 09:35.100
cozy blankets,
long naps, car rides.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.300
And neither one of us
likes thunder storms.

09:37.300 --> 09:38.800
Or vacuum cleaners.

09:38.800 --> 09:40.900
Vacuum cleaners
are the worst.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.467
If you don't wear
your shoes inside,

09:42.467 --> 09:44.100
there's no need
for a vacuum.

09:44.100 --> 09:47.100
I love shoes.

09:47.100 --> 09:49.767
Me, too! I wear them
everywhere.

09:51.300 --> 09:55.133
I can't wait for my parents to
see how perfect we are together.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.200
Ow.

10:06.200 --> 10:10.300
Hey, Alex, we're getting
cups-on-chains to wear
around our necks.

10:10.300 --> 10:14.567
[laughs] Well, Justin's
girlfriend's a dog.

10:16.300 --> 10:17.400
Watch.

10:17.400 --> 10:20.767
Hey, guys! Can I play?

10:20.767 --> 10:22.300
Thank you.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.867
Yo, Isabella!
Fetch!

10:27.734 --> 10:29.033
[growls]

10:32.000 --> 10:34.900
Hey, Alex.
Isn't Isabella great?

10:34.900 --> 10:38.300
She's so athletic
and friendly.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.700
She says "hello" to
everyone in the park.

10:41.700 --> 10:44.734
Yeah, your girlfriend's
a dog.

10:44.734 --> 10:48.400
What are you talking about?
She's beautiful.

10:48.400 --> 10:50.600
You just hate that we're
perfect for each other.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.133
She put my sweater
in her mouth

10:53.133 --> 10:54.667
and played tug-of-war with me.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.300
Isabella's hiding something.

10:56.300 --> 11:00.667
Oh, you just don't
like the fact that
I'm falling in love.

11:00.667 --> 11:04.400
Yeah. Yeah, I am.
I'm falling in love.

11:07.200 --> 11:11.233
She ate a dog biscuit like
it was a chocolate chip cookie
right out of the oven.

11:11.233 --> 11:13.033
- [scoffs]
- She jumped in the air

11:13.033 --> 11:15.400
and caught a plastic
flying disc in her mouth.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.834
We both love catching plastic
flying discs in our mouth.

11:23.033 --> 11:26.467
That's one of
the many things
that we have in common.

11:27.767 --> 11:30.400
You can't catch a plastic
flying disc in your mouth.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.934
You can't catch a plastic
flying disc in your hands.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.967
Oh, yeah?

11:34.967 --> 11:37.233
Hey, Gunnar, hit me.

11:42.734 --> 11:44.767
Good throw!

11:44.767 --> 11:46.667
Am I bleeding?

11:50.767 --> 11:53.600
OK, OK, the swelling's
going down,

11:53.600 --> 11:56.667
you've cried it out,
you're gonna live.

11:56.667 --> 12:01.600
Now, Isabella, did you leave out
one piece of crucial information

12:01.600 --> 12:04.800
on your WizFace page, like
the fact that you're a dog?

12:06.233 --> 12:07.734
That's ridiculous.

12:07.734 --> 12:10.000
I wouldn't be ready
to commit myself to Isabella

12:10.000 --> 12:12.867
without having a pretty
good idea of who she is.

12:12.867 --> 12:14.233
You're not a dog,
are you?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.000
- No.
- See?

12:16.000 --> 12:18.100
I'm a werewolf.

12:20.000 --> 12:24.000
Whoa. I did not
see that coming.

12:26.767 --> 12:29.500
So what?

12:29.500 --> 12:32.667
Not seeing things coming
is the roller coaster of love.

12:32.667 --> 12:35.033
And I am strapped in,
ready for the ride.

12:35.033 --> 12:38.500
Today, I found out
my girlfriend's a werewolf.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.767
Yay!

12:41.467 --> 12:43.500
How many other guys
can say that?

12:43.500 --> 12:45.300
Well, none, because
I'm guessing

12:45.300 --> 12:48.300
anybody else who
could say that
has been eaten.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.934
That's a stereotype.
We're actually very loving.

12:51.934 --> 12:53.667
I sensed that about you.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.200
Oh, Justin, come on!

12:55.200 --> 12:57.600
Just admit it.
You don't know
anything about her.

12:57.600 --> 13:00.600
Oh, Alex. I can't believe
your level of jealousy.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.800
I just hope that one day
you can be as happy as we are.

13:06.200 --> 13:09.700
Oh, Justin, there is
one more thing that
you should know about me.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.667
Yes, my love?

13:11.667 --> 13:16.400
When you kiss a werewolf,
you turn into a werewolf.

13:21.567 --> 13:25.300
Ah. Perfect.

13:29.400 --> 13:32.600
Oh my gosh, this is
gonna be so painful!

13:32.600 --> 13:34.467
As my genetic structure
is changing,

13:34.467 --> 13:36.200
as my spine shifts
from human to canine,

13:36.200 --> 13:37.967
as my hands elongate
and become lupine,

13:37.967 --> 13:41.400
waiting for the claws to shoot
out of my fingernails... [gasps]

13:41.400 --> 13:43.100
I love you, Isabella!

13:45.200 --> 13:48.767
That's another stereotype.
The change is pretty fast
and painless.

13:48.767 --> 13:51.000
Really?

13:55.600 --> 13:58.467
Oh. You're right.

13:58.467 --> 14:02.500
[growls] Nice coat.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.667
Thanks.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.900
Alex, what are
we gonna do?

14:09.900 --> 14:14.367
Well, don't ask me. I proved
you guys don't know each other.
My work is done.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.867
[barks]

14:24.834 --> 14:27.000
OK, so I'm a werewolf.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.867
There's a price to love.
Love hurts. But I didn't die.

14:30.867 --> 14:32.967
Just a werewolf.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.600
I'm not gonna die,
am I?

14:34.600 --> 14:39.467
No, you're good.
Just don't chase cars.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.734
All right, that's about as much
puppy love as I can take.

14:42.734 --> 14:45.000
Get it? Where do I
come up with these things?

14:45.000 --> 14:49.500
Wait. Alex, you're not
gonna tell Dad, right?

14:49.500 --> 14:51.500
No.

14:51.500 --> 14:53.467
Because Dad would want
to blame this all on WizFace

14:53.467 --> 14:55.300
and then say, "I told you so."

14:55.300 --> 14:57.734
And then he'd want
to change me back.

14:59.967 --> 15:04.000
And maybe I don't
want to get changed back.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.100
Maybe I like enjoy seeing
everything in black and white.

15:08.500 --> 15:10.767
Maybe I'm perfectly
happy now as a werewolf.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.100
With Isabella.

15:12.100 --> 15:15.900
- What is that smell?
- It's you, dude.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.300
- It comes with the fur.
- Oh.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.200
Well, then I like it.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.300
I love having fur.

15:25.300 --> 15:26.867
I'm enjoying my
new lease on life.

15:26.867 --> 15:30.000
Don't you mean leash on life?
Oh, man. That is good one.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.133
Up top. Oh, careful
with the claw, though.

15:32.133 --> 15:35.400
Stop judging us
with your hurtful jokes.

15:36.700 --> 15:39.700
Come on, Isabella. We're
obviously not accepted here.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.200
We have to do
what people in love

15:41.200 --> 15:42.900
have done since the
beginning of time.

15:42.900 --> 15:46.700
Run away to the only place
where animals can be free.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.200
The park!

15:49.867 --> 15:53.367
OK, don't forget your
collars. It's flea season!

15:53.367 --> 15:56.600
Another one.
I am on fire.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.100
OK, we're actually
going now.

15:59.100 --> 16:03.600
And like I said,
don't tell Dad that
we're going to the park, OK?

16:03.600 --> 16:07.767
I'm not. Why are you still here
and not chasing a cat?

16:07.767 --> 16:10.800
It's that kind of hatred
and prejudice

16:10.800 --> 16:14.133
that makes us unable to stay
here for one more moment.

16:14.133 --> 16:15.300
Come on, my love.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.400
- [growling]
- [howling]

16:24.100 --> 16:26.934
Hey, Alex, successful day
of dog walking.

16:26.934 --> 16:29.500
I got my
cup-on-a-chain.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.200
Yep. Livin' the dream.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.000
What's going on here?

16:34.000 --> 16:38.100
Well, Justin's WizFace girl
turned out to be a werewolf.

16:38.100 --> 16:40.033
They kissed,
he turned into a werewolf

16:40.033 --> 16:45.000
and they away to spend the
rest of their lives together.
So I guess it's just you and me.

16:45.000 --> 16:48.400
Well, hey, I got Justin
a cup-on-a-chain, but, uh...

16:48.400 --> 16:50.600
His loss is your gain,
right?

16:53.600 --> 16:56.500
Let's have a race
to see who can fill
theirs with spit first.

16:56.500 --> 16:57.700
Go!

16:57.700 --> 17:00.367
Oh, my goodness,
I can't live like this.

17:00.367 --> 17:02.033
Where are you
going?

17:02.033 --> 17:05.900
To tell Dad that Justin's
a werewolf and that I need
him back right away.

17:15.033 --> 17:17.400
[owl hooting]

17:17.400 --> 17:20.600
I'm so glad we're
out here starting
our new lives together,

17:20.600 --> 17:26.200
holding paws on this bench
with nobody stopping us,
including my parents.

17:26.200 --> 17:30.600
I don't even care
if they were looking for me
and even if they heard me.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.400
[howling]

17:33.400 --> 17:37.200
I'm Justin Russo!
[howling]

17:37.200 --> 17:40.000
Sitting on this
park bench!

17:40.000 --> 17:42.934
Next to the lamp post.
[howling]

17:52.800 --> 17:55.500
I'm getting
kind of hungry.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.734
We should go eat
some cats or something.

17:57.734 --> 18:01.300
Werewolves don't eat cats.
That's a stereotype.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.967
Just like how we only
change during a full moon.

18:03.967 --> 18:05.667
We change every night.

18:06.967 --> 18:09.834
Even better.

18:09.834 --> 18:12.500
It's like people watch
a couple of movies

18:12.500 --> 18:14.734
and suddenly they
know all about werewolves.

18:14.734 --> 18:17.500
Oh, I love those movies.
Like that one:<i>Hey, Werewolf?</i>

18:17.500 --> 18:21.200
about the inner-city school
guidance counselor who
understands the kids,

18:21.200 --> 18:23.600
because he knows
what it feels like
to be an outsider.

18:23.600 --> 18:27.100
I can't believe you
would watch those movies.
They're demeaning.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.700
I mean,<i>Hey, Werewolf?</i>

18:28.700 --> 18:31.033
I didn't believe
Ashton Kutcher for one minute.

18:31.033 --> 18:33.300
Those shows make us
look like animals

18:33.300 --> 18:36.200
instead of people with
a condition, with
proper diet and exercise,

18:36.200 --> 18:38.300
can live a normal,
healthy life.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.367
[growls, howls]

18:43.200 --> 18:45.467
I'm sorry.

18:45.467 --> 18:48.000
OK. I got
a little worked up.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.300
But I had no idea you
liked werewolf movies.

18:51.300 --> 18:54.900
That's the type of thing
you should've listed
on your WizFace profile.

18:54.900 --> 18:57.967
I mean, I don't
really care where
you went to chess camp.

18:59.667 --> 19:03.000
You're mad at me
because I left something out
of my WizFace profile?

19:03.000 --> 19:07.000
I think you left
something out of your WizFace
profile that's pretty big.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.367
What?

19:08.367 --> 19:11.200
Hmm... let me think
about what it is

19:11.200 --> 19:15.100
while I stroke my beard.
And my arms.

19:15.100 --> 19:18.400
And my whole body
because there's
hair all over it.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.667
[making kissing sounds]

19:22.667 --> 19:23.834
[ball squeaks]

19:25.667 --> 19:28.700
Most moms have to look
for their lost kids at
the department store,

19:28.700 --> 19:32.467
but no, I have to look
for my werewolf son
in the park!

19:32.467 --> 19:35.300
Hey. I said we'll get
pretzels when we find him.

19:35.300 --> 19:37.200
We can get
pretzels anywhere.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.100
Oh my gosh,

19:44.100 --> 19:47.500
do you smell your mom,
your dad and your sister?

19:47.500 --> 19:49.133
But mostly your dad?

19:50.867 --> 19:52.934
Yeah. And I see them.

19:52.934 --> 19:57.200
And after I
specifically told them
not to come after me!

19:57.200 --> 19:59.000
Boy am I mad at her.

19:59.934 --> 20:02.133
- Over here!
- Good.

20:02.133 --> 20:04.667
We'll lure them over and
then make a mad dash for it.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.200
Exactly.

20:06.200 --> 20:07.934
I'll go this way
and you go that way.

20:07.934 --> 20:09.467
And no stopping
and digging.

20:09.467 --> 20:10.500
Got it!

20:22.300 --> 20:26.734
Oh, guys, there's something
I have to tell you.

20:26.734 --> 20:30.100
You won best in show?
Congratulations.

20:31.500 --> 20:33.400
I don't have to say,
"I told you so," do I?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.200
No.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.467
Well, I do.

20:37.467 --> 20:39.567
I told you so.

20:39.567 --> 20:42.100
You cannot trust what
people say on WizFace.

20:42.100 --> 20:45.800
I thought we learned
that when your prom date had
matching shoes and saddle.

20:45.800 --> 20:49.867
But apparently someone has to
turn themselves into a werewolf
for the lesson to take.

20:49.867 --> 20:53.667
My poor baby's
a werewolf!

20:53.667 --> 20:55.300
What are we gonna do?

20:55.300 --> 20:57.667
Well, I'm not
shaving him.

20:59.500 --> 21:01.200
It's not about shaving Justin.

21:01.200 --> 21:03.867
I remember a recipe
to a potion.

21:03.867 --> 21:05.934
Thank you.
I'll drink anything.

21:05.934 --> 21:08.567
It's not exactly
a drinking potion.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.500
Dad, this is embarrassing.

21:16.500 --> 21:19.934
I know. It's a potion
and a punishment all in one.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.600
I don't think it's working.
He's still hairy.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.600
I'm cool as long as
he doesn't use my brush.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.967
Oh, maybe you do drink it.

21:30.967 --> 21:33.400
Yep, it's a drinking potion.

21:33.400 --> 21:35.467
[Theresa] What?!

21:35.467 --> 21:39.233
I didn't have to scrape
eggshells and coffee grounds
out of the bottom of that thing?

21:39.233 --> 21:42.767
Yeah, looks like we learned
a couple of things today.

21:42.767 --> 21:45.367
Yeah, Justin learned not
to trust people on WizFace,

21:45.367 --> 21:47.567
and you learned what
the word "ingest" means.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.667
I thought it meant joking.

21:51.033 --> 21:53.934
Am I supposed to drink
my own bath water?

21:53.934 --> 21:56.200
[both chanting]
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

21:56.200 --> 21:59.800
[continue chanting]

22:05.233 --> 22:07.867
Ugh. I think I swallowed
an eggshell.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.600
Hey, it's good
to see you again.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.867
Yeah. I felt bad that it didn't
work out so well with us.

22:19.867 --> 22:22.867
I guess we should have gotten
to know each other first.

22:24.967 --> 22:28.600
I know. We didn't even get to
slow dance together at the prom.

22:30.300 --> 22:31.734
I'm not doing
anything right now.

22:31.734 --> 22:33.000
Me neither.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.467
Cool.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.000
Later.
