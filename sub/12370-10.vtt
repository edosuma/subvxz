00:02.335 --> 00:03.920
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.003 --> 00:06.089
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.172 --> 00:09.092
- WELL, CROSS ANOTHER THING OFF
MY BUCKET LIST.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.136
I HAVE BEEN TO A NUDE BEACH.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.596
- I DIDN'T KNOW CLEVELAND HAD
A NUDE BEACH.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.392
- IT HAS ONE MORE
THAN IT SHOULD.

00:17.475 --> 00:20.311
- YOU SAID I WOULDN'T RUN
INTO ANYONE I KNEW THERE.

00:22.355 --> 00:23.648
- ELKA, I'M SORRY.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.442
HOW WAS I TO KNOW
THAT YOUR BUTCHER

00:25.525 --> 00:27.569
WAS GONNA BE
AT A NUDE BEACH?

00:27.652 --> 00:31.489
- I'LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ORDER
KIELBASA FROM THAT MAN AGAIN.

00:33.908 --> 00:35.702
- SO WHAT'S NEXT
ON YOUR BUCKET LIST?

00:35.785 --> 00:37.370
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.956
BUT NOW THAT I'M HEALTHY AGAIN,
I WANT TO DO EVERYTHING.

00:40.039 --> 00:41.750
- OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BECOME
ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE

00:41.833 --> 00:43.293
WHO LIVES LIFE TO THE FULLEST,
ARE YOU?

00:43.376 --> 00:46.838
BECAUSE EVERYONE HATES
THOSE PEOPLE.

00:46.921 --> 00:49.132
- I'M NOT SURE WHAT I'D PUT
ON MY BUCKET LIST.

00:49.215 --> 00:52.510
I SUPPOSE "FIND TRUE LOVE
AND GET MARRIED."

00:52.594 --> 00:56.556
- IT'S A BUCKET LIST, DEAR,
NOT A LETTER TO SANTA.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.310
- WHAT'S ON YOUR BUCKET LIST?

01:00.393 --> 01:03.521
- I WANT TO GET RICH OFF
MY POLISH POLISH.

01:03.605 --> 01:06.816
- THE CLEANER YOU INVENTED
THAT SMELLS LIKE POT?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.651
- YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN SELL
THAT STUFF?

01:08.735 --> 01:12.697
- IT WORKS ON GREAT ANYTHING
OLD AND TARNISHED.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.825
I'LL LET YOU LICK THE BOWL.

01:19.078 --> 01:21.372
- WELL, MY BUCKET LIST
HASN'T CHANGED.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.666
ONE THING--
WIN AN OSCAR.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
- REALLY?
THAT'S IT?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.170
NO REGRETS?
NO WRONGS YOU WANT TO RIGHT?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.006
- WELL, THERE IS
SOMEONE I WRONGED

01:30.089 --> 01:31.841
WHO I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT LATELY--

01:31.925 --> 01:34.177
MADDIE BANKS.
- OH, THE BROADWAY ACTRESS.

01:34.260 --> 01:36.137
- YEAH, WE WERE ROOMMATES
IN ACTING SCHOOL.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.348
AND ONE DAY
THIS CASTING DIRECTOR CALLED

01:38.431 --> 01:39.474
AND TOLD ME
TO HAVE MADDIE COME IN

01:39.557 --> 01:40.517
FOR A BIG AUDITION.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.060
IT WAS DOWN TO TWO ACTRESSES.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.020
AND I KNOW
I SHOULD'VE TOLD HER,

01:44.103 --> 01:45.563
BUT SHE HAD JUST STOLEN
MY BOYFRIEND,

01:45.647 --> 01:46.773
AND I WANTED TO GET BACK
AT HER.

01:46.856 --> 01:49.734
IT WAS <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE.</i>
- YOU WERE THAT TORN?

01:49.818 --> 01:51.820
- NO, THE MOVIE
WAS <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE.</i>

01:53.238 --> 01:55.198
AND THE ACTRESS
WAS MERYL STREEP,

01:55.281 --> 01:57.075
AND I NEVER TOLD MADDIE
ABOUT THE AUDITION,

01:57.158 --> 01:59.869
AND I'VE FELT GUILTY
EVER SINCE.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.830
- IT'S NEVER TOO LATE
TO APOLOGIZE.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.916
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S TRUE.

02:04.999 --> 02:07.544
AND RIGHTING A WRONG
WITH AN ACTRESS

02:07.627 --> 02:10.338
COULD HELP MY OSCAR KARMA.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.675
YOU KNOW, ACCORDING
TO MY "KARMOLOGIST"...

02:13.758 --> 02:15.510
I MADE A HUGE MISTAKE

02:15.593 --> 02:18.930
BY DONATING MY KIDNEY
SO FAR FROM THE VOTING SEASON.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.349
I AM GONNA CALL MADDIE.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.518
- YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY
HOW YOUR BUCKET LIST CHANGES.

02:23.601 --> 02:26.271
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,
IT WAS GET MARRIED, HAVE KIDS--

02:26.354 --> 02:28.231
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:28.314 --> 02:30.733
NOW I JUST WANT TO DO EVERYTHING
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DO.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.902
I JUST WANT TO BE BAD.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.530
- I KNOW WHAT WAS
ON MY BUCKET LIST BACK THEN.

02:35.613 --> 02:38.408
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS, BUT
WHEN I FIRST CAME TO AMERICA,

02:38.491 --> 02:40.285
I AUDITIONED
FOR THE ROCKETTES.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.203
[chuckles]
ONLY, I FROZE.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.789
I COULDN'T GET MY LEGS
IN THE AIR.

02:49.669 --> 02:53.006
- YOU SURE GOT OVER THAT ONE.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.218
- THIS IS PERFECT.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.762
MADDIE IS OUT OF TOWN
ON A CRUISE

02:59.846 --> 03:00.722
WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND,

03:00.805 --> 03:02.724
BUT SHE OFFERED
TO LET ME STAY AT HER PLACE.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.101
- AND DID YOU APOLOGIZE
FOR <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE?</i>

03:05.184 --> 03:06.477
- NO, THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THIS PERFECT.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.104
I'LL GO TO NEW YORK,

03:08.187 --> 03:11.399
WRITE THE APOLOGY,
LEAVE A NICE BOTTLE OF WINE,

03:11.482 --> 03:13.610
AND WON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH ALL THE DRAMATICS

03:13.693 --> 03:16.821
THAT SOME ACTRESSES
ARE GIVEN TO.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.575
- HEY, WHY DON'T WE ALL GO?

03:20.658 --> 03:22.452
NEW YORK IS THE PERFECT PLACE
TO BE BAD.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.747
I AM GONNA EAT AND SHOP
AND SLEEP AROUND.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.248
I WON'T EVEN BE
MELANIE MORETTI.

03:27.332 --> 03:30.084
I'M GONNA BE--
OH, I DON'T KNOW--

03:30.168 --> 03:33.171
SCARLETT DENEUVE.

03:33.254 --> 03:35.506
- THIS COULD END IN...

03:42.180 --> 03:44.390
- WELL,
IF CRAZY'S ON THE TABLE,

03:44.474 --> 03:45.892
RADIO CITY IS IN NEW YORK.

03:45.975 --> 03:48.436
I KNOW I'M TOO OLD
TO ACTUALLY BE A ROCKETTE,

03:48.519 --> 03:51.147
BUT MAYBE I CAN GET
ANOTHER SHOT AT AN AUDITION.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.650
- I COULD SELL MY POLISH
TO THE BIG MONEY BOYS

03:53.733 --> 03:54.817
IN MANHATTAN.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.527
- SO IT'S SETTLED.

03:56.611 --> 04:00.031
ELKA'S GONNA GO AND TRY TO SELL
HER RIDICULOUS INVENTION.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.783
JOY IS GOING TO FEED
HER DELUSIONS

04:01.866 --> 04:03.993
OF BECOMING A ROCKETTE.

04:04.077 --> 04:07.330

INTO A LUDICROUS ALTER EGO.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.500

AND A CLEAR PATH

{\an8}WELL, YOU KNOW, EX-BOYFRIEND.

{\an8}- OH. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE

05:29.203 --> 05:31.080
{\an8}OH, OH, OH, OH,
YOU MEAN THIS THING.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.206
{\an8}OH, YEAH, YEAH.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THIS.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.792
{\an8}THIS IS JUST SOME PROP I USED
IN AN OLD PLAY I DID.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.794
[gunshot, all screaming]

05:40.840 --> 05:42.759
OOPSIE.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.635
ARE YOU GONNA EAT THAT?

05:47.680 --> 05:49.807
I KNOW I JUST MET JASON
THREE WEEKS AGO,

05:49.891 --> 05:51.768
BUT IT WAS
AN INSTANT CONNECTION...

05:51.851 --> 05:54.312
TILL THIS MORNING
WHEN HE ROLLED OVER IN BED

05:54.395 --> 05:56.647
AND HE SAID,
"I FEEL LIKE HAVING

05:56.731 --> 05:59.192
"POACHED EGGS AND MIMOSAS...

05:59.275 --> 06:02.945
AND ANOTHER WOMAN."

06:03.029 --> 06:04.614
- SO HE BROKE UP WITH YOU
ON A YACHT

06:04.697 --> 06:06.741
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN?
- YEAH.

06:06.824 --> 06:08.701
YOU KNOW, FIRST,
I WAS DEVASTATED.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.495
THEN I JUST THOUGHT,
"YOU KNOW WHAT? FINE.

06:10.578 --> 06:12.163
"THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH
IN THE SEA.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.915
I'LL JUST LEAVE."

06:13.998 --> 06:16.084
SO I JUMPED
INTO THIS LITTLE DINGHY,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.127
AND I WAS TRYING TO ROW,
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

06:18.211 --> 06:21.255
IT FLIPPED OVER,
AND IT STARTED SINKING.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.591
AND I LOOKED AROUND,
AND THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

06:23.674 --> 06:25.760
THERE REALLY AREN'T PLENTY
OF FISH IN THE SEA.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.345

06:27.428 --> 06:28.930
- MADDIE...

06:29.013 --> 06:31.349
I'M SORRY.

06:31.432 --> 06:34.936
BUT MAYBE
HE DID YOU A FAVOR.

06:35.019 --> 06:38.022
YOU REMEMBER PROFESSOR KNOLL,
OUR GREAT ACTING TEACHER?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.316
NOW, HE WOULD TELL YOU
TO USE THIS GRIEF

06:40.399 --> 06:42.026
AS A SENSE MEMORY
FOR YOUR CRAFT.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.779
YOU KNOW, SHOULD YOU EVER
BE CALLED UPON

06:44.862 --> 06:46.697
TO PLAY A DRUNKEN ACTRESS
DUMPED BY HER BOYFRIEND

06:46.781 --> 06:50.159
WHOSE HEART IS STILL BIG ENOUGH
TO FORGIVE A FRIEND.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.078
- IF THEY WROTE
THAT PART YOUNGER AND SEXIER,

06:52.161 --> 06:53.162
I THINK I COULD PLAY IT.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.580
- YEAH.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.332
- OH, DID YOU KNOW

06:58.042 --> 06:59.168
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.505
- WELL, WHO WILL TEACH
INTRO TO EMOTIONS?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.883
- IS THAT THE SAME GUY
WHO TAUGHT YOU SCENERY CHEWING?

07:05.967 --> 07:08.052
- YEAH.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.762
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.681
AS LONG AS YOU'RE IN TOWN,
WHY DON'T WE THROW HIM A PARTY?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.432
- A PARTY IS A GREAT IDEA.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.018
- AND WE CAN ASK
A LOT OF HANDSOME MEN

07:16.102 --> 07:18.271
FROM THE THEATER WORLD.

07:18.354 --> 07:21.858
- YEAH, AND A FEW STRAIGHT ONES
JUST TO MIX THINGS UP.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.818
- WELL, THE ONLY STRAIGHT ONE
I KNOW IN THE THEATER

07:23.901 --> 07:25.027
IS KEVIN KLINE.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.696
AND EVERY TIME I SEE HIM,
IT REMINDS ME

WHAT SHOULD WE DO
FOR ENTERTAINMENT?

- "YOU REALLY BROUGHT HELL
TO LIFE FOR ME."

NOW THAT WE'RE BOTH FAMOUS,

08:22.793 --> 08:24.212
I BET WE COULD GET
OUR PLAY PRODUCED.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.880
- THAT'S BRILLIANT!

08:25.963 --> 08:27.381
AND I'LL INVITE THE PRESS.

08:27.465 --> 08:30.051

09:01.666 --> 09:04.293
THAT'S A TEMPTING COMBINATION.

09:04.377 --> 09:07.922

TO GIVE INTO TEMPTATION.

- AMONG OTHER THINGS.

09:16.722 --> 09:20.309

BUT THEY WERE JUST STARING
AT THE SURVEILLANCE CAMERA.

09:30.695 --> 09:31.404
- OH.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.823
I WAITED IN LINE
FOR THREE HOURS.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.324
WHEN I FINALLY GOT
TO THE FRONT,

09:35.408 --> 09:37.368
THEY SAID I WAS TOO OLD
TO EVEN AUDITION.

09:37.451 --> 09:40.329
IT WAS <i> AMERICAN IDOL</i>
ALL OVER AGAIN.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.790
- MY DAY WAS A BUST TOO.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.167
- ELKA MET WITH SOME
YOUNG VENTURE CAPITALISTS.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.003
THEY SAID HER POLISH
WAS TOO STRONG.

09:47.086 --> 09:51.340
- YOU MELT ONE ROLEX,
AND IT'S TOO STRONG.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.508
[cell phone beeps]

09:52.591 --> 09:53.342
- [gasps]
OOH.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.678
I JUST GOT ANOTHER RSVP
FOR THE PARTY.

09:55.761 --> 09:59.348
ANOTHER POTENTIAL INVESTOR
FOR <i> ETERNITY'S RAINBOW.</i>

09:59.432 --> 10:02.226
- INVESTORS COMING--
INTERESTING.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.561
[cell phone beeps]

10:03.644 --> 10:05.855
- OH!
RON TISCH IS COMING TOO.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.524
HE OWNS RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL.

10:08.607 --> 10:11.736
- HOME OF THE ROCKETTES--
ALSO INTERESTING.

10:14.613 --> 10:17.199
- GUESS WHO JUST HAD SEX
IN AN ELEVATOR.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.660
- THAT'S WHY THE ELEVATOR
WAS STOPPED.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.370
- YEAH, DID THE DEED
WITH A STRANGER,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.372
DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.167
- MELANIE,
I AM ASHAMED OF YOU.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.836
THAT'S JOY'S THING.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.758
- I AM EXHAUSTED.
I AM GONNA TAKE A PARTY NAP.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.552
- ME TOO.

10:36.635 --> 10:38.387
- OOH.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.348
HE'S CUTE.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.267
IS THIS GUY COMING
TO THE PARTY?

10:43.351 --> 10:45.561
- NO.
THAT'S JASON, MY EX.

10:45.644 --> 10:47.229
HE'S PROBABLY OUT THERE
RIGHT NOW

10:47.313 --> 10:48.731
SLEEPING WITH ANOTHER WOMAN.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.691
I HOPE SHE DIES
A HIDEOUS, TERRIBLE,

10:50.775 --> 10:53.402
HORRIBLE, DISFIGURING DEATH.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.905
I MISS YOU, BABY.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.578
- OH, MELANIE,

11:02.661 --> 11:04.080
THIS PARTY WAS SUCH
A GOOD EXCUSE

11:04.163 --> 11:05.373
TO COME TO NEW YORK.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.749
- YOU CAME TO NEW YORK

11:06.832 --> 11:09.085
TO APOLOGIZE TO MADDIE
FOR <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE.</i>

11:09.168 --> 11:11.253
- YES, BUT THEN I REALIZED
HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE

11:11.337 --> 11:12.463
FOR HER TO FORGIVE ME,

11:12.546 --> 11:15.216
SO I DID HER A FAVOR
AND FORGAVE MYSELF.

11:16.926 --> 11:20.137
AND IF THAT ISN'T KARMA,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.430
- THAT'S NOT KARMA.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.599
- THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

11:25.601 --> 11:28.104
MM. MADDIE, MY LOVE,
FABULOUS PARTY.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.605
- I KNOW.

11:29.688 --> 11:31.399
AND THERE'S TONS
OF POTENTIAL INVESTORS HERE

11:31.482 --> 11:32.441
FOR <i> ETERNITY'S RAINBOW.</i>

11:32.525 --> 11:34.860
I WAS EXPLAINING THE PLOT
TO A BUNCH OF THEM,

11:34.944 --> 11:37.154
AND I GOT ALL SORTS
OF ENCOURAGING NODS

11:37.238 --> 11:38.572
AND RESPECTFUL SILENCE.

11:38.656 --> 11:40.116
- FANTASTIC.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.494
OH, LOOK,
THERE'S PROFESSOR KNOLL.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.705
LET'S GO OVER AND SHOW HIM
FRIENDLY EXCITEMENT NUMBER ONE.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.749
- OH, YEP.

11:50.167 --> 11:53.629
- SO YOU INVESTED IN <i> GREASE.</i>

11:53.712 --> 11:57.967
HOW ABOUT INVESTING IN SOMETHING
THAT GETS RID OF GREASE?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.802
[glass clinking]
- EXCUSE ME.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.846
EXCUSE ME.
COULD I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION?

12:01.929 --> 12:03.806
I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU
ALL FOR JOINING US

12:03.889 --> 12:06.684
THIS EVENING TO HONOR
PROFESSOR ANDREW KNOLL,

12:06.767 --> 12:09.145
A GREAT TEACHER AND ARTIST.

12:09.228 --> 12:13.149
HE'S JUST INFORMED ME
THAT HE'S ON TOTAL VOCAL REST

12:13.232 --> 12:16.652
BECAUSE TOMORROW HE'S FILMING
A JACK IN THE BOX COMMERCIAL

12:16.735 --> 12:18.946
FOR THE NEW PANCAKE
CHICKEN SANDWICH!

12:19.029 --> 12:21.615
[applause]

12:23.451 --> 12:26.829
- WELL, OUR LOSS
IS JACK IN THE BOX'S GAIN.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.790
SO, EVERYONE, JUST EAT,
DRINK, BE MERRY,

12:29.874 --> 12:33.669
AND BE PREPARED FOR SOME
VERY SPECIAL ENTERTAINMENT.

12:38.340 --> 12:41.177
[applause]

12:41.260 --> 12:44.054
- STOP CLAPPING, EVERYONE.
THAT'S NOT THE ENTERTAINMENT.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.223
THAT'S JUST A CRAZY WOMAN.

12:46.307 --> 12:50.144
- FOR GOODNESS SAKES,
WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING?

12:50.227 --> 12:53.189
- WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO--
AUDITION TO BE A ROCKETTE.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.025
OH, THERE'S MR. TISCH.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.195
[shoes clicking]

12:59.278 --> 13:03.407
- THE DIRT ON THE TONY
IS GONE...

13:03.491 --> 13:06.452
AND SO IS THE ENGRAVING.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.163
- HELLO.
- [laughs]

13:09.246 --> 13:10.539
- JOY SCROGGS.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.875
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
RON TISCH.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.668
- OH, YOU HAVE A CRUMB
ON YOUR SHOULDER.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.047
- OH.
- OH, PLEASE, ALLOW ME.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.049
- [laughs]
THAT'S VERY IMPRESSIVE.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.927
- THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.554
- WOW.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.264
- HI, ELKA.
HAVING FUN?

13:27.348 --> 13:28.432
- NO.

13:28.516 --> 13:29.934
LOOK.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.352
- WHERE'S MADDIE'S NAME?

13:31.435 --> 13:34.230
- ON MY RAG.

13:34.313 --> 13:37.233
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- ELKA RUINED MADDIE'S TONY.

13:37.316 --> 13:38.817
- OH, MY GOD.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.278
[gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.905
THAT'S COLLIN BRETT--

13:42.988 --> 13:44.448
THE CASTING DIRECTOR
WHO GAVE ME THE MESSAGE

13:44.532 --> 13:45.783
ABOUT <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE.</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:48.035
UGH.
HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.537
- NEITHER IS HE.

13:49.620 --> 13:51.705
THAT'S THE GUY I SLEPT WITH
IN THE ELEVATOR.

13:51.789 --> 13:52.915
- THAT GUY?

13:52.998 --> 13:55.834
THAT'S MADDIE'S BOYFRIEND.
- WHAT?

13:55.918 --> 13:58.796
I SLEPT WITH MADDIE'S BOYFRIEND?
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.215
- I SABOTAGED HER CAREER.
SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.425
- I RUINED HER TONY.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.428
SHE'S GONNA USE IT
TO KILL ME.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.055
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

14:08.138 --> 14:11.892
- I'M SORRY, BUT THE CUTOFF AGE
FOR AUDITIONS IS 29.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.812
- BUT 40 IS THE NEW 20.
- [laughs]

14:14.895 --> 14:16.897
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY YOU'RE 40?

14:19.316 --> 14:20.484
- WE NEED TIME.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.444
- WE NEED A DIVERSION.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.114
- WELL, IF I WERE TOO OLD,
COULD I DO THIS?

14:25.197 --> 14:27.491
[shoes clicking]

14:27.575 --> 14:28.617
[thud]

14:28.701 --> 14:30.452
- WHOA!

14:30.536 --> 14:32.663
- YEP, THAT'LL DO.

14:39.169 --> 14:40.462
- OKAY, JOY IS IN THE KITCHEN
WITH MADDIE,

14:40.546 --> 14:41.922
PUTTING ICE ON HER FACE.
- OH, GOOD.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.257
OKAY, I'LL GET COLLIN
OUT OF THE ROOM,

14:43.340 --> 14:44.466
AND YOU TAKE CARE OF JASON.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.760
- AND I'M GONNA POLISH OFF
THIS VODKA.

14:46.844 --> 14:48.304
- STOP POLISHING THINGS!

14:48.387 --> 14:49.179
JUST--

14:49.263 --> 14:52.099
COLLIN BRETT,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:52.182 --> 14:53.976
- VICTORIA CHASE.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.312
WELL, I WAS INVITED
BY PROFESSOR KNOLL.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.689
WE DO PILATES TOGETHER.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.316
YOU LOOK WONDERFUL.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.984
- I KNOW, AND I'D LOVE
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT IT,

15:02.067 --> 15:02.985
BUT YOU COULD REALLY USE

15:03.068 --> 15:04.820
A LITTLE MOUTHWASH.
- OH.

15:04.903 --> 15:05.988
- THE BATHROOM IS RIGHT DOWN
THERE ON THE LEFT.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.823
TAKE YOUR TIME.
- AH.

15:07.906 --> 15:10.367
- JASON, WE HAVE TO TALK.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.869
- OH, MY GOD,
ELEVATOR PIZZA GIRL.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.037
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.663
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.
YOU NEED TO GO.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.998
- NO, NO, NO.
I NEED TO SEE MADDIE.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.124
I HEARD THE PARTY
FROM MY APARTMENT

15:17.207 --> 15:18.250
AND REALIZED HOW MUCH
I MISSED HER.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.376
I'VE COME TO GET HER BACK.

15:19.460 --> 15:21.962
- OH, THAT'S REALLY VERY SWEET,
BUT CAN YOU NOT MENTION

15:22.046 --> 15:23.631
THE WHOLE "WE HAD SEX" THING?

15:23.714 --> 15:27.551
AND DON'T MENTION MY NAME?
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW YOUR NAME.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.304
- SHE'S COMING.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.680
- OH, NO, I TOLD YOU
TO KEEP HER IN THE KITCHEN.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.140
- THERE'S ONLY SO LONG
YOU CAN KEEP

15:33.223 --> 15:35.726
A BROADWAY ACTRESS
AWAY FROM AN AUDIENCE.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.855
- JASON?
- MADDIE.

15:39.938 --> 15:42.650
I'M SO SORRY.
I MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

15:42.733 --> 15:43.817
I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.361
- OH, REALLY?

15:45.444 --> 15:46.987
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO SLEEP WITH OTHER WOMEN.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.657
- I DID.
IT WAS DISGUSTING.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.867
- WELL, THAT'S A STRONG WORD.

15:51.950 --> 15:53.202
- I HATED EVERY SECOND OF IT.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.538
- I THINK THERE WERE
A FEW SECONDS YOU LIKED.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.875
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M SAYING THAT.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.502
- WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?

16:01.585 --> 16:03.504
- BECAUSE THE LONGER YOU KEEP
A BETRAYAL A SECRET,

16:03.587 --> 16:04.838
THE WORSE IT GETS.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.050
- BETRAYAL, SECRETS--
NOW IT'S A PARTY.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.551
- COLLIN BRETT?

16:09.635 --> 16:11.553
- OH, HE--HE WAS JUST LEAVING.
- NO, HE WASN'T.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.723
OH, SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, MADDIE.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.725
OH, WOW.

16:16.809 --> 16:20.562
THE TWO OF YOU, 30 YEARS,
TOGETHER AGAIN.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.023
[chuckles] DIDN'T YOU USED
TO SHARE AN APARTMENT?

16:23.107 --> 16:24.858
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

16:24.942 --> 16:26.235
- OF COURSE WE DID, VICTORIA.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.820
- OH, LET'S NOT DWELL
ON THE PAST

16:27.903 --> 16:30.572
OR DWELL ON PLACES
WE DWELLED IN THE PAST.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.950
- NO, I REMEMBER, BECAUSE I GOT
MADDIE THAT MOVIE AUDITION,

16:33.033 --> 16:34.743
AND I CALLED
AND SPOKE TO VICTORIA.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.078
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.788
SOME LITTLE MOVIE
THAT WENT NOWHERE.

16:37.871 --> 16:40.416
- HARDLY.
IT WAS <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE.</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:42.042
I ALWAYS WONDERED
WHY YOU DIDN'T SHOW UP.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.420
- I GOT THE AUDITION?
- YES.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.422
- AND YOU NEVER TOLD ME?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.589
- THE ONLY REASON I DID IT

16:47.673 --> 16:49.591
WAS BECAUSE YOU SLEPT
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.801
- OH, PLEASE.

16:50.884 --> 16:52.219
THE ONLY REASON I SLEPT
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND

16:52.302 --> 16:53.595
IS BECAUSE HE SLEPT
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.931
- OH, LET'S NOT FIGHT.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.766
LET'S ALL JUST GET ALONG.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.103
TWO, THREE, FOUR...

17:03.397 --> 17:05.482
- THIS MUST BE THEIR PLAY.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.233
- NO, THIS ISN'T THE PLAY.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.737
I JUST FOUND OUT
I SHOULD'VE BEEN MERYL STREEP.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.114
- I THINK IT'S A COMEDY.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.907
- MADDIE, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT
YOU WOULD'VE GOTTEN THAT ROLE.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.452
- OF COURSE
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN THAT ROLE.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.412
I'M A FABULOUS ACTRESS.

17:18.494 --> 17:21.832
IF I WASN'T, MY NAME
WOULDN'T BE ON THIS TONY.

17:21.915 --> 17:23.791
OH!

17:23.876 --> 17:26.837
MY NAME ISN'T ON THIS TONY!

17:26.920 --> 17:30.466
- BUT LOOK HOW SHINY IT IS.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.676
- YOU RUINED MY LIFE!

17:32.760 --> 17:34.928
I WILL NEVER SPEAK
TO YOU AGAIN!

17:35.012 --> 17:36.847
- MADDIE, DIAL THE DIVA DOWN

17:36.930 --> 17:40.267
BEFORE WE ALL START PULLING OFF
EACH OTHER'S WIGS.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.644
MERYL STREEP WAS ALWAYS GOING
TO GET THAT PART.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.689
YOU WERE GOOD, BUT WE ALWAYS
BRING IN A SECOND ACTOR

17:45.773 --> 17:47.691
TO KEEP THE PRODUCERS HAPPY.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.486
IN SHORT, YOU WERE SECOND CHOICE
FOR <i> SOPHIE'S CHOICE,</i>

17:50.569 --> 17:52.488
JUST LIKE VICTORIA
WAS SECOND CHOICE

17:52.571 --> 17:54.031
FOR JESSICA LANGE
IN <i> TOOTSIE.</i>

17:54.114 --> 17:57.868
- WHAT?
I NEVER GOT THAT CALL.

17:57.951 --> 18:01.121
- BUT THE IMPORTANT PART...

18:01.205 --> 18:04.458
IS THAT YOU WENT ON TO HAVE
A GREAT CAREER.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.293
- YES.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.670
AND SO DID YOU.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.340
OH, MADDIE,
CAN YOU EVER FORGIVE ME?

18:11.423 --> 18:14.009
- YES, I CAN FORGIVE YOU,
VICTORIA.

18:14.092 --> 18:16.720
YOU WERE AWFUL TO ME.
- YEAH.

18:16.804 --> 18:19.515
- AND I WAS AWFUL TO YOU.
- YEAH.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.100
- AND YOU KNOW WHAT WE CALL
THAT IN THE THEATER?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.853
FRIENDSHIP.

18:24.937 --> 18:28.023
- MADDIE, I HOPE YOU CAN FIND
A WAY TO FORGIVE ME TOO.

18:28.106 --> 18:32.653
{\an1}LET'S NOT END OUR RELATIONSHIP
OVER ONE MISTAKE IN AN ELEVATOR.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.488
- OH.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.658
"ELEVATOR"?

18:37.741 --> 18:39.910
- SHE ERASED YOUR TONY!

18:39.993 --> 18:41.411
- SHUT UP, SCARLETT!

18:49.086 --> 18:52.130
- [Southern accent] OH.
WELL, FINALLY, SISTER WOMAN,

18:52.214 --> 18:55.759
THERE'S OUR BUS.

18:55.843 --> 18:59.096
- [Southern accent]
NEXT STOP, ETERNITY'S RAINBOW.

19:01.139 --> 19:04.059
- [normal voice]
AND CURTAIN.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.687
- [normal voice]
WELL, WHAT'D YOU THINK?

19:06.770 --> 19:09.565
- I'D GET OUT MY RAG,
BUT NOTHING COULD POLISH

19:09.648 --> 19:13.277
THAT PIECE OF [bleep].

19:22.160 --> 19:23.412
- OH, SHE'S RIGHT.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.248
IT WAS TERRIBLE--
SO PRETENTIOUS.

19:26.331 --> 19:27.082
- NO.
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.750
I KNOW THE PLAY IS AWFUL.

19:28.834 --> 19:30.294
BUT, WELL, I'M GLAD
TO HAVE YOU BACK IN MY LIFE.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.045
- YOU TOO.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.046
- WHAT ARE THESE?

19:33.130 --> 19:35.591
- PROFESSOR KNOLL
MUST HAVE LEFT HIS SIGNS.

19:35.674 --> 19:38.427
- "MORE WINE, PLEASE."

19:38.510 --> 19:41.889
"YOU WERE WONDERFUL IN THAT."

19:41.972 --> 19:43.599
"YOU DESERVE THE TONY."

19:43.682 --> 19:46.435
- AW.
THAT ONE'S FOR ME.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.270
- "YOU SHOULD WIN AN OSCAR."

19:48.353 --> 19:50.981
- AW.
THAT ONE'S FOR ME.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.609
- "I STILL THINK
ABOUT OUR NIGHT TOGETHER."

19:53.692 --> 19:55.736
both:
AW.
