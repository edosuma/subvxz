a demon and fall off the wagon...

I haven't learned my lesson.

00:19.937 --> 00:21.230
Well, have you?

00:24.233 --> 00:26.694
-I know you don't trust me.
-What are you saying?

00:26.944 --> 00:28.779
Maybe it's best

03:30.169 --> 03:33.130

06:19.505 --> 06:21.840
-What's Little Bastard?
-It's James Dean's car.

-The one he was killed in.
-Yeah, that's the one.

06:24.593 --> 06:27.846
Cal had been looking for it for years.
I mean, hell, we both had.

06:28.514 --> 06:31.141
But he found it first.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.562
We are definitely checking this out.

06:40.818 --> 06:43.862
So what? This is like Christine?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.532
Well, Christine is fiction. This--

06:46.740 --> 06:48.784
This is real.

06:50.369 --> 06:52.746
Okay, enlighten me.

06:53.580 --> 06:58.627
After James Dean died, his mechanic
bought the wreckage and he fixed it up.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.506
And it repaid him by falling on him.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.425
Then Tony McHenry was killed
when it locked up on the racetrack.

like exhaust.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.848

and comes away in one piece.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.436

it vanished off the back of a truck.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.273
Nobody's ever seen it since.

if this car is Little Bastard...

07:22.234 --> 07:25.487
...I will bet you dollars to doughnuts
it's what killed the guy.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.822
So how do we find out?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.700
Cal matched the VIN number
but the only real way to know...

07:29.908 --> 07:31.618
...is the engine number.

07:32.578 --> 07:36.498

-Any of them die bloody?
-Nope. In fact--

10:01.143 --> 10:02.519

14:53.935 --> 14:56.187
More than the, you know
non-famous kinds.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.481
I'm surprised
we haven't run into one.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.026
Now we got two?
Two extremely pissed-off ghosts?

15:01.109 --> 15:04.446
-Who are apparently ganking their fans.
-What do you mean?

15:04.696 --> 15:08.283
Professor Hill was a Civil War nut.
He dug Lincoln.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.493
And Cal must've been
a James Dean freak.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.580
He spent 17 years of his life
tracking down the guy's car.

15:13.663 --> 15:16.499
So you're saying
that we've got two super-famous...

15:16.708 --> 15:20.503
...super-pissed-off ghosts
killing their super-fans?

15:22.964 --> 15:25.133
That's what it looks like.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.761
That is muchos loco.

15:28.803 --> 15:32.349
"Muy," not "muchos."

15:33.683 --> 15:36.436
The big question is,
what the hell are they doing here?

15:36.519 --> 15:39.356
Yeah. Ghosts usually haunt
the places they lived.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.317
I mean, I get Abraham Lincoln
at the White House.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.944
Yeah, and James Dean at a racetrack.

15:45.153 --> 15:47.030
But what the hell they doing in Canton?

15:57.415 --> 15:59.042
You gotta be kidding me.

16:00.377 --> 16:01.961
What?

16:07.133 --> 16:08.927
You gotta be kidding me.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.158
DEAN:
Dude, he's short.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.202
Hey.

16:34.411 --> 16:35.578
Gandhi was a great man.

16:36.413 --> 16:37.997
Yeah, for a Smurf.

16:38.998 --> 16:43.461
Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting.
This is our busiest time of year.

16:45.714 --> 16:47.048
This is busy?

16:47.257 --> 16:49.426
Well, not right now but it's early.

16:50.093 --> 16:52.679
-It's 4:30.
-So, what can I do for you?

16:52.887 --> 16:55.306
Well, we are writing a piece
for Travel Magazine.

16:55.515 --> 16:59.269
Yeah, on how totally non-sucky
wax museums are.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.980
That's fantastic, a little press.
Just what we need.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.232
Great.
We're interested in a few exhibits.

17:04.441 --> 17:06.609
Specifically Abraham Lincoln
and James Dean.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.820
-Two of our most popular displays.
-Yeah?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.614
-They bring in a lot of visitors?
-We have our regulars.

17:11.823 --> 17:16.035
I don't suppose that William Hill and
Cal Hopkins were regulars, were they?

17:16.244 --> 17:18.663
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they were.

17:18.747 --> 17:22.584
I heard what happened to them.
It's tragic, just tragic.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.586
That's not gonna be in the article,
is it?

17:24.794 --> 17:26.254
No, no, no. Of course not.

17:26.463 --> 17:30.300
You know, I gotta tell you,
that Lincoln is so lifelike.

17:30.508 --> 17:34.512
I mean, you know, you can just
imagine him moving around.

17:34.929 --> 17:37.223
You ever see anything like that?

17:37.807 --> 17:40.685
-Uh-- No.
-No?

17:40.894 --> 17:43.021
Well, is there anything
you can think of...

17:43.229 --> 17:47.317
...that would make your museum
unusual? You know, for the article.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.944
I'll say. There isn't another place
like us anywhere.

17:50.153 --> 17:51.571
How so?

17:51.654 --> 17:53.907
Well, for one,
that's Honest Abe's real hat.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.743
It is?

17:56.951 --> 17:58.912
Almost like his remains.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.875
I guess.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.545
You wouldn't happen to have
any of James Dean's personal effects?

18:07.629 --> 18:10.006
Yeah. Got his keychain.
I got a bunch of stuff.

18:10.089 --> 18:13.092
Gandhi's bifocals, FDR's iron lung.

18:13.301 --> 18:14.719
This.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.555
Who did that belong to?

18:17.639 --> 18:20.809
The Fonz. Seasons two through four.

18:21.559 --> 18:24.521
Well, wow.
Yeah, that's really cool-ish.

18:24.729 --> 18:28.358
This? This is nothing. I've been working
on a new collection of figures.

18:28.566 --> 18:29.859
Stuff that will wow the kids.

18:30.068 --> 18:31.528
-The kids?
-Yeah, Gen Y.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.365
Computer games, cell phones, sexting.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.283
They're just fads.

18:37.492 --> 18:40.328
I'm gonna make wax museums
hip again.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.163
(DEAN CHUCKLING)

19:02.767 --> 19:06.563
DEAN: Yeah, Abraham Lincoln and
James Dean. Can you believe that?

19:06.771 --> 19:08.606
Why so kill crazy? I don't know.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.442
Maybe the Apocalypse
has got him all hot and bothered.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.403
Well, we all know whose fault that is.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.780
Well, I'm sorry, but it's true.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.620
I'll call you later. Bye.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.788
What's going on?

19:23.997 --> 19:26.708
-Did you get the trunk packed up?
-Yeah, trunk's packed.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.418
-Who was on the phone?
-Bobby.

19:28.626 --> 19:31.588
-And?
-Nothing.

19:32.046 --> 19:35.258
So we're just gonna pretend
I didn't hear what I just heard?

19:35.633 --> 19:37.760
Pretend or don't.
Whatever floats your boat.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.471
This was supposed to be a fresh start,
Dean.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.640
Well, this is about as fresh as it gets.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.767
Now, we going or not?

19:51.190 --> 19:52.775
(SIGHS)

20:19.552 --> 20:20.720
Check it out.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.973
(IMITATING LINCOLN'S VOICE)
Four score and seven years ago...

20:24.057 --> 20:27.477
-...I had a funny hat.
-Dean.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.895
DEAN:
I can't have any fun with this?

20:29.103 --> 20:32.774
Let's just torch the objects, torch
the ghosts, get out of here, okay?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.859
I'll grab East of Eden's keychain.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.447
Dean?

21:23.783 --> 21:25.535
Dean.

21:40.258 --> 21:41.926
(CLICKING)

22:05.825 --> 22:07.326
-Dean.
-Is that Gandhi?

22:07.535 --> 22:09.537
-Yeah.
-Dude, he's squirrely.

22:09.746 --> 22:11.372
Get-- Get the--

22:14.917 --> 22:16.127
DEAN:
Get the what?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.879
Glasses.

22:30.808 --> 22:33.102
(PANTING)

22:34.937 --> 22:37.523
You couldn't have been a fan
of someone cool?

22:38.983 --> 22:41.778
Really? Gandhi?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.704
You ready to blow this joint?

22:51.913 --> 22:57.293
Dean, didn't it strike you as strange
the way Gandhi just vanished?

22:57.502 --> 23:00.088
-Strange how?
-No screaming, no big flameout.

23:00.296 --> 23:02.507
I mean, that isn't the way
ghosts usually go.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.509
Still, I torched, he vanished.

23:04.717 --> 23:10.723
Yeah, but-- Also, I feel like
he was trying to take a bite out of me.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.975
-A bite?
-Yeah, like he was hungry.

23:13.184 --> 23:16.562
But the thing is, Gandhi--
Or the real Gandhi.

23:16.771 --> 23:18.606
He was a--

23:18.815 --> 23:20.483
A what?

23:21.734 --> 23:23.361
Spit it out.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.779
He was a fruitarian.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.157
(LAUGHS)

23:29.200 --> 23:30.910
Let me get this straight.

23:31.119 --> 23:34.372
Your ultimate hero
was not only a short man in diapers...

23:34.580 --> 23:36.624
...but he was also a fruitarian?

23:36.833 --> 23:39.919
-That's not the point.
-That is good. Even for you, that's good.

23:40.128 --> 23:42.964
I'm just saying,
I'm not so sure this thing is over.

23:43.631 --> 23:44.799
It was a ghost.

23:45.007 --> 23:48.553
It was a weirdly supercharged
fruitarian ghost, but it was still a ghost.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.388
Now, let's go.

23:50.596 --> 23:54.016
So first you drag me into town
and now you're dragging me back out?

23:54.225 --> 23:57.979
You ain't steering this boat.
Let's go. Chop-chop.

23:58.187 --> 23:59.856
You know, this isn't gonna work.

24:01.899 --> 24:04.068
-What isn't?
-Us.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.946
You, me, together.
I thought it could, but it can't.

24:07.029 --> 24:09.073
You're the one that wanted back in,
chief.

24:09.157 --> 24:11.033
You're the one who called me back in.

24:11.117 --> 24:13.327
I still think we got trust building to do.

24:13.536 --> 24:15.997
How long am I gonna be
on double-secret probation?

24:16.205 --> 24:18.207
Till I say so.

24:18.749 --> 24:22.003
Look, I know what I did.
What I've done.

24:22.211 --> 24:24.547
And I'm trying
to climb out of that hole. I am.

24:24.755 --> 24:28.843
-But you're not making it any easier.
-I'm supposed to let you off the hook?

24:29.051 --> 24:32.430
No. You can think whatever you want.
I deserve it and worse.

24:32.638 --> 24:36.017
Hell, you'll never punish me
as much as I'm punishing myself.

24:36.642 --> 24:40.897
But the point is,
if we're gonna be a team, you and I...

24:40.980 --> 24:43.107
...it has to be a two-way street.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.068
We go back
to the way we were before?

24:46.152 --> 24:49.155
No, because we were never that way
before. Before didn't work.

24:49.238 --> 24:50.990
How do you think we got here?

24:51.866 --> 24:53.409
What's that supposed to mean?

24:53.618 --> 24:56.537
Dean, one of the reasons
I went off with Ruby...

24:57.830 --> 24:59.999
...was to get away from you.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.210
What?

25:02.418 --> 25:06.214
It made me feel strong.
Like I wasn't your kid brother.

25:08.049 --> 25:09.800
Are you saying this is my fault?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.594
No, it's my fault.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.096
All I'm saying
is that if we're gonna do this...

25:14.305 --> 25:18.559
...we have to do it different.
We can't just fall into the same rut.

25:18.893 --> 25:20.311
What do you want me to do?

25:21.187 --> 25:23.689
You're gonna have to let me grow up,
for starters.

25:24.232 --> 25:26.817
(PHONE RINGING)

25:34.659 --> 25:36.285
Yeah.

25:40.331 --> 25:43.209
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

25:45.878 --> 25:48.923
I guess you were right
about this not being over.

25:54.929 --> 25:57.556
SAM: Sheriff Carnegie?
-Sheriff, what happened?

25:57.765 --> 25:59.850
I, uh....

26:00.268 --> 26:02.228
I don't know.

26:07.483 --> 26:12.071
-Excuse us, girls. Hi, we're with the FBI.
-Can you tell us what happened?

26:12.780 --> 26:15.116
-It was horrible.
-Way horrible.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.785
-What was horrible?
-I thought she'd be nice.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.370
I still can't believe it.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.998
-Believe what?
-She took Danielle.

26:22.373 --> 26:24.166
Who?

26:24.959 --> 26:28.879
It's okay, you're safe.
Just tell us, who took your friend?

26:30.131 --> 26:32.717
It was Paris Hilton.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.721
-Sorry?
-She looked really good though.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.639
-Skinny.
-Skinny and fast.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.309
Wha--? Huh?

26:43.019 --> 26:44.812
Where did they go?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.356
-We don't know.
-They just vanished.

26:47.898 --> 26:51.068
Would you excuse us
for just a minute?

26:52.737 --> 26:55.239
(WHISPERING) Paris Hilton's
not dead as far as we know, right?

26:55.323 --> 26:56.615
Pretty sure, no.

26:56.699 --> 26:59.410
-Which means it's not a--?
-Ghost. No.

26:59.660 --> 27:02.038
So either Paris Hilton
is a homicidal maniac--

27:02.121 --> 27:04.248
Or we missed something.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.542
What do you wanna do?

27:20.931 --> 27:22.224
(GRUNTS)

27:30.107 --> 27:31.817
That's ripe.

27:50.169 --> 27:51.879
What the hell?

27:55.591 --> 27:57.885
-I can't believe I missed it.
-Missed what?

27:58.094 --> 27:59.804
I went back over the other two vics.

28:00.012 --> 28:03.182
-There was blood loss, major.
-Being a gory smear will do that to you.

28:03.391 --> 28:07.186
No, more blood loss than a car crash or a
head wound should cause. Almost like--

28:07.395 --> 28:08.813
DEAN: Something's feeding.
-Yeah.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.482
DEAN: Awesome.
-And then there were these.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.988
-What are those, seeds?
-Yeah, they were in both vics' bellies.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.448
I hope you washed your hands.

28:19.657 --> 28:22.868
They're unlike any other seed
I've ever seen before, Dean.

28:23.077 --> 28:26.247
Wow, just when I thought
you couldn't get any geekier.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.591
Yahtzee.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.802
-What?
-The seeds aren't from around here.

28:40.010 --> 28:42.847
In fact, they're not from any tree
or plant in the country.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.807
-Where are they from?
-Eastern Europe.

28:45.015 --> 28:47.476
A forest in the Balkans
which is not there anymore.

28:47.685 --> 28:49.437
It was chopped down
like 30 years ago.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.648
-So?
-So local legend has it...

28:52.857 --> 28:56.402
...that the forest was guarded
by a pagan god whose name was Leshii.

28:56.610 --> 28:59.363
A mischievous god.
Could take on infinite forms.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.366
And let me guess,
he liked to munch on his fans.

29:02.950 --> 29:06.203
Yep. "Could be appeased only
with the blood from his worshippers."

29:06.412 --> 29:09.540
It would drain them, then
stuff their stomachs with the seeds.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.625
How does he do it?

29:11.917 --> 29:14.503
What, he touches
James Dean's keychain...

29:14.712 --> 29:17.089
...and then morphs into James Dean?

29:18.340 --> 29:21.135
Hm. As good a guess as any.

29:21.677 --> 29:24.388
Yeah, well, whatever.
How do we kill him?

29:24.472 --> 29:27.975
Says here to chop off his head
with an iron ax.

29:28.058 --> 29:32.480
All right.
Let's go gank ourselves a Paris Hilton.

30:20.945 --> 30:22.488
(WHISTLES)

30:49.056 --> 30:50.641
SAM:
Hey.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.186
She alive?

30:54.728 --> 30:56.397
Yeah, barely.

31:12.746 --> 31:13.998
Awesome.

31:50.826 --> 31:54.955
Oh, I'm so glad you're awake for this.

31:55.164 --> 31:57.541
This is gonna be huge.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.672
Super. I wouldn't wanna miss it.

32:03.881 --> 32:07.509
I mean, I've been stuffing myself
with fast food lately.

32:07.718 --> 32:10.346
So it's nice to do the ritual right.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.182
Prepare a nice slow meal for a change.

32:13.641 --> 32:16.393
Just like the good old days, huh?

32:16.477 --> 32:20.147
You have no idea. People adored me.

32:20.272 --> 32:24.276
They used to throw themselves at me
with smiles on their faces.

32:25.194 --> 32:29.948
I guess these days nobody gives a crap
about some backwoods forest god, huh?

32:33.952 --> 32:37.748
No, not since they cut down my forest
and built a Yugo plant.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.000
The march of progress, sister.

32:40.209 --> 32:43.379
For years now, I've been wandering.

32:43.587 --> 32:45.881
Hungry. Scared.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.592
Scrounging for scraps.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.219
So not sexy.

32:51.303 --> 32:55.474
But then,
the best thing ever happened.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.519
Someone tripped the Apocalypse,
and I thought:

32:58.727 --> 32:59.812
What the hell?

33:00.062 --> 33:02.439
I'm tired of watching what I eat.

33:02.523 --> 33:04.650
I wanna pig out.

33:05.442 --> 33:08.904
So I found this little place.
It's awesome.

33:09.113 --> 33:11.573
Adoring fans stroll right in the door.

33:11.907 --> 33:14.576
Yeah, but they're not your fans.

33:14.660 --> 33:18.747
So? They worship Lincoln,
Gandhi, Hilton.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.375
Whatever. I'll take what I can get.

33:21.583 --> 33:25.003
You know, I gotta tell you,
you are not the first god we've met.

33:25.212 --> 33:28.966
-But you are the nuttiest.
-No, you. You people.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.509
You're the crazy ones.

33:30.718 --> 33:35.180
You used to worship gods. But this?

33:35.389 --> 33:39.601
This is what passes for idolatry?
Celebrities?

33:39.810 --> 33:42.521
What have they got besides small dogs
and spray tans?

33:43.856 --> 33:46.442
You people used to have
old-time religion.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.360
Now you have Us Weekly.

33:48.861 --> 33:51.488
I don't know. I'm more of a
Penthouse Forum man myself.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.574
(CLICKS TONGUE)

33:55.576 --> 33:57.619
PARIS:
Maybe.

33:57.995 --> 34:01.373
But there's still a lot of yummy meat
on those bones, boy.

34:02.416 --> 34:07.588
I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you can't eat me.

34:07.796 --> 34:11.008
See, I'm not a Paris Hilton BFF.

34:11.216 --> 34:14.303
I've never even seen House of Wax.

34:15.220 --> 34:18.891
No. But I can totally read your mind,
Dean.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.977
I know who your hero is. Your daddy.

34:22.519 --> 34:25.189
Am I right?

34:26.982 --> 34:28.984
And this belonged to him.

34:30.194 --> 34:33.030
Didn't it? Poor little Dean.

34:33.238 --> 34:36.074
All you ever wanted
was to be loved by your idol.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.620
One distant father figure,
coming right up.

35:14.905 --> 35:17.115
-Not a word.
-Dude.

35:17.324 --> 35:21.370
You just got whaled on by Paris Hilton.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.288
Shut up.

35:30.254 --> 35:32.005
DEAN:
Uh-huh.

35:33.048 --> 35:36.009
All right. Thank you.

35:36.802 --> 35:40.055
Sheriff Carnegie.
Danielle's gonna be all right.

35:40.138 --> 35:43.058
She's sworn off The Simple Life,
but other than that--

35:43.141 --> 35:44.768
Glad she's okay.

35:44.852 --> 35:46.186
It gets better.

35:46.270 --> 35:49.356
The sheriff's putting out an APB
on Paris Hilton. Heh, heh.

35:49.439 --> 35:51.525
That ought to be good.

35:57.114 --> 36:00.158
Listen, I was thinking
about what you said yesterday.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.370
About me keeping
too tight of a leash on you.

36:04.371 --> 36:05.622
Maybe you're right.

36:07.666 --> 36:11.044
I mean, I'm not exactly Mr. Innocent
in this whole mess either, you know.

36:11.295 --> 36:12.671
I did break the first seal.

36:12.921 --> 36:15.048
-You didn't know.
-Yeah, neither did you.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.261
I'm not saying demon blood was
a great way to go but you did kill Lilith.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.347
-And start the Apocalypse.
-Which neither of us saw coming.

36:22.556 --> 36:25.851
Who would've thought killing Lilith
would've been a bad thing?

36:28.604 --> 36:31.440
Point is, I was so worried
about watching your every move...

36:31.648 --> 36:34.443
...that I didn't see
what it was actually doing to you.

36:36.862 --> 36:38.030
So for that, I'm sorry.

36:39.406 --> 36:41.158
Thanks.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.455
Where do we go from here?

36:46.663 --> 36:49.082
The way I see it,
we got one shot at surviving.

36:49.166 --> 36:51.168
-What's that?
-I am on deck for the devil.

36:51.251 --> 36:53.879
Same with you and Michael.
There's no changing that.

36:54.087 --> 36:55.088
Well, that's encouraging.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.966
But we can stop
wringing our hands over it.

36:58.175 --> 37:02.387
We gotta grab whatever's in front of
us, kick its ass, and go down fighting.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.894
-I can get on board with that.
-Okay.

37:09.102 --> 37:11.480
But we're gonna have to do it
on the same level.

37:15.484 --> 37:16.610
You got it.

37:21.615 --> 37:24.743
-What do you say we get out of here?
-Hell, yeah.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.496
Hey.

37:34.127 --> 37:35.253
You wanna drive?

37:38.090 --> 37:39.216
You sure?

37:40.092 --> 37:43.136
Yeah. I could-- I could use a nap.

38:15.043 --> 38:16.962
-You ready?
-Hit it, Mr. Wizard.

38:19.172 --> 38:20.257
Oh!

38:20.465 --> 38:21.925
Nutcracker!

38:22.884 --> 38:23.969
(TIRES SCREECHING)

38:27.889 --> 38:29.141
Hey, Sam. What's happening?

38:30.058 --> 38:31.518
Just the end of the world.

38:31.768 --> 38:32.978
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

38:33.061 --> 38:35.147
-Stay away from me.
-Mrs. Wright, wait.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.693
-You're not demons?
-How'd you know about demons?

38:39.943 --> 38:42.112
CASTIEL:
This child is half-demon and half-human.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.156
It's far more powerful than either.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.409
CASTIEL:
One word.

38:47.617 --> 38:51.204
This child will destroy
the host of heaven.

38:51.455 --> 38:54.249
And I can't take that chance.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.804
Poker. You play for years.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.181
DEAN:
That's 25 years.

39:09.264 --> 39:11.224
-You sure?
-Yes.

39:16.146 --> 39:17.230
SAM:
Who the hell are you?

39:17.481 --> 39:21.193
-Dude, relax, it's me.
-Dean?

39:21.401 --> 39:23.779
I see you met John McCain here.

39:34.331 --> 39:35.415
Ow!

39:44.841 --> 39:48.261
Well, I say jackpot.
