WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.609
Focus, Parker.
You can do this.

00:03.711 --> 00:06.329
- Level the ionic charge.
- Increase the temperature.

00:06.376 --> 00:08.494
Guys, I'm trying
to concentrate here.

00:08.626 --> 00:10.517
And if I mess up,
I won't win

00:10.634 --> 00:13.783
that giant Princess Strawberry
Rainbow Golden Hair doll!

00:13.947 --> 00:15.431
Yes! I win!

00:15.572 --> 00:18.775
Congratulations. But if you
want to win at the Stark Expo,

00:18.856 --> 00:20.965
then you'll help us
with our experiment.

00:21.134 --> 00:24.767
Max specifically said to give our
brains a rest today, and have fun.

00:24.931 --> 00:26.650
But this is
how we have fun.

00:26.787 --> 00:29.821
Well, maybe we can examine
a different kind of fun,

00:29.918 --> 00:32.314
like the ringtoss game.

00:32.439 --> 00:35.379
But the ring's circumference is smaller
than the diameter of the bottle.

00:35.526 --> 00:38.306
- It's impossible.
- Is it?

00:40.621 --> 00:42.208
Yes. It is.

00:42.298 --> 00:44.542
Okay.
But it was fun, right?

00:44.626 --> 00:47.926
Not as fun as unlocking
the secret of V-252.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.230
You brought our science
project to the beach?

00:50.301 --> 00:53.699
The clock is ticking. We need to
spend every waking moment on it.

00:53.754 --> 00:56.887
Sorry. The lab is closed. Come on.

00:57.016 --> 01:00.298
And to think at Midtown High,
I was the socially awkward one.

01:04.512 --> 01:07.137
Yes! I am the strongest.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.884
All who see me
tremble, like...

01:10.158 --> 01:11.652
Parker.

01:11.808 --> 01:14.173
Long time, no "sea."
Get it?

01:14.298 --> 01:16.543
"Sea"? 'Cause
we're at the ocean?

01:16.808 --> 01:18.174
Hey, Flash.

01:18.222 --> 01:19.722
Yeah, I get it.

01:20.902 --> 01:22.158
These are my friends

01:22.259 --> 01:24.332
- from Horizon High.
- What's up, nerds?

01:24.402 --> 01:26.301
Hmm?

01:26.441 --> 01:27.887
Typical alpha male.

01:28.018 --> 01:29.392
Classic power imbalancer.

01:29.517 --> 01:32.119
Surprised he's not
kicking sand in our faces.

01:32.532 --> 01:34.743
What'd you call me?
I'm not a...

01:34.871 --> 01:37.751
- Hey! What gives?
- Uh, chill out, Flash.

01:37.947 --> 01:41.431
The weather...
just took a dramatic turn.

01:45.584 --> 01:48.697
Never heard of a sandstorm
at Coney Island.

01:52.884 --> 01:55.407
And I've never heard
of a sandstorm with a face!

01:57.000 --> 02:03.074

02:12.584 --> 02:14.517
It passed right through us!

02:14.642 --> 02:16.743
And now it's headed
for the Ferris wheel!

02:16.829 --> 02:19.915
- Uh... My prize!
- Oops!

02:27.338 --> 02:29.472
Not as important as changingant?
Into Spider-Man.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.353
<i>[distorted voices
laughing on</i>

02:32.640 --> 02:35.749
Whoo! No more funnel cake
for me.

02:37.025 --> 02:38.895
Bad enough I got sand
in my shorts.

02:39.030 --> 02:41.811
Now this seems to be going
from bad to worse.

02:46.985 --> 02:50.539
Everyone,
take cover in the fun house!

02:50.652 --> 02:53.405
Go, Spidey! Hey!

02:53.461 --> 02:55.846
Spidey said get to safety!
So go then.

02:58.548 --> 03:02.586
One person's ride
is another person's rescue.

03:08.857 --> 03:11.708
Never doubt the strength
of the Spidey-go-round.

03:11.910 --> 03:13.776
<i>â™ª </i>

03:19.950 --> 03:24.277
Let's go! Let's go!
Head for the fun house! Unh!

03:25.925 --> 03:28.089
The science project!
Take cover!

03:28.213 --> 03:30.878
- Not without my project.
- I'll get it.

03:38.150 --> 03:39.644
Whoa! What was that?

03:39.692 --> 03:42.573
Felt like my whole body just got
jolted with pins and needles.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.667
Here. Put it in this.

03:45.108 --> 03:47.527
Here's your goo back.
Now get inside.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.159
Don't have to tell me twice.

03:56.654 --> 03:58.788
Let's see how you do
with a mouth full of webbing.

04:00.625 --> 04:02.792
Nothing.
If I can't stop it,

04:02.827 --> 04:04.947
might as well go along
for a ride.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.784
Whoa!

04:08.362 --> 04:10.400
Spidey's having
a hard time out there.

04:10.448 --> 04:13.151
How can he fight it when it
doesn't have any shape or form?

04:13.347 --> 04:14.378
We should help him.

04:14.534 --> 04:16.800
He said stay
by the carnival games.

04:16.928 --> 04:20.308
Doesn't mean we can't do both.
Grab some of those lava lights.

04:20.456 --> 04:22.558
Anya, unhook the water guns.

04:22.863 --> 04:25.997
Hey, wanna try
the new parachute ride?

04:26.205 --> 04:29.272
Fun, right? You don't have to answer.

04:31.009 --> 04:32.309
Now get to the safety
of the fun house.

04:32.344 --> 04:34.845
What are you supposed to be?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.523
Stand back, Spider-Man.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.271
We used parts
of the carnival games

04:38.319 --> 04:40.233
to create a coagulation gun.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.846
Now! How?

04:41.984 --> 04:44.422
Just to make these web shooters.

04:44.640 --> 04:47.038
Now watch me stop it
in its tracks.

04:47.265 --> 04:48.467
Sorry.

04:48.515 --> 04:50.545
You must be at least
this tall

04:50.593 --> 04:52.203
to fight
the sand creature.

04:53.047 --> 04:56.086
Hey! Don't worry.
You'll get the credit.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.110
I just want the big sandy prize.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.834
Huh?

05:04.898 --> 05:06.750
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

05:09.723 --> 05:11.089
Uh...
Whew.

05:11.179 --> 05:15.675
Help... me...

05:15.963 --> 05:18.198
- What did you say?
- Don't worry, Spidey.

05:18.269 --> 05:19.737
I got your back.

05:20.315 --> 05:21.818
No!

05:22.932 --> 05:24.228
I did it!

05:24.581 --> 05:26.162
Yeah, you did it,
all right.

05:26.385 --> 05:29.165
Ruined my chances of finding
out what that thing was.

05:32.265 --> 05:34.070
Couldn't sleep
at all last night.

05:34.296 --> 05:37.312
That plea for help sounded
more human than sand creature.

05:37.945 --> 05:40.217
And since we live in a world
where a kid like me

05:40.265 --> 05:41.913
can gain the powers
of a spider,

05:42.038 --> 05:44.398
it's worth checking out.

05:45.382 --> 05:48.952
Luckily, there was enough sand in my
costume to grab a sufficient sample.

05:49.031 --> 05:51.648
And since it's Sunday,
I'll have the lab all to mysel...

05:51.742 --> 05:53.406
What are you guys
doing here?

05:53.851 --> 05:55.926
Making up the time
we lost yesterday.

05:55.999 --> 05:58.226
Great social director
you turned out to be.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.334
Don't worry about it.
Just get over here

06:00.382 --> 06:02.382
and start logging
some hours on this thing.

06:02.515 --> 06:04.140
I will. I just...

06:04.252 --> 06:06.864
I just need to take care of
something else first.

06:06.912 --> 06:09.465
- Whoa! Look at this!
- Huh?

06:09.902 --> 06:13.293
Those readings are off the charts.
What did you do?

06:13.434 --> 06:16.504
Nothing. It was just
a sudden surge of activity.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.215
Gotta check something
in my lab.

06:20.691 --> 06:21.887
We lost it.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.120
Let's run
another full analysis.

06:26.109 --> 06:27.461
Okay, Sandy.

06:27.656 --> 06:30.250
Maybe if I can help you
become more cohesive,

06:30.601 --> 06:32.828
you can say
more than "help me."

06:33.531 --> 06:36.976
I need to ionize the granule
particles and get them to bond.

06:38.016 --> 06:40.172
Sure could use
some help with this,

06:40.281 --> 06:43.016
but the other are so focused
on the Stark Expo entry.

06:43.344 --> 06:44.367
Hmm?

06:47.523 --> 06:49.750
- Hey, Pete. What's going on?
- <i>Got a sec?</i>

06:49.906 --> 06:54.125
Sure. I'm just, uh, fiddling with
something new for the Stark Expo.

06:54.307 --> 06:55.311
- Us too.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

06:55.359 --> 06:58.121
How's it going over there
with the, uh...

06:58.750 --> 07:00.742
Uh, what did you call it again?

07:01.101 --> 07:04.242
Very funny. You're not getting
any secrets out of me.

07:05.320 --> 07:07.718
Then this is gonna
be a short conversation.

07:07.766 --> 07:10.555
Actually, I've got
a non-Expo-related question.

07:10.742 --> 07:13.226
What do you know
about cohesive materials?

07:26.312 --> 07:29.430
Keemia...

07:33.219 --> 07:34.751
Need to follow,

07:34.891 --> 07:38.555
but still
having trouble forming.

07:39.454 --> 07:42.962
Something's missing.

07:48.261 --> 07:49.839
Harry's a genius.

07:49.923 --> 07:53.758
The molecular polarity reacts to
the ions of an electrical charge.

07:54.454 --> 07:58.305
Given time, I might be able
to achieve cohesion.

07:58.508 --> 08:00.679
Yo, Earth to Pete.

08:01.008 --> 08:02.376
You forget something?

08:02.524 --> 08:04.040
The experiment!

08:04.165 --> 08:06.335
I'm so sorry, Miles.
I lost track of time.

08:06.383 --> 08:07.423
Well, jump to it.

08:07.524 --> 08:09.868
If we get this baby
to stabilize permanently,

08:09.938 --> 08:12.891
Horizon High gets to add it
to the periodic table.

08:13.024 --> 08:15.876
I'm thinking we call it
"Miles-Moralium."

08:16.024 --> 08:18.337
I think "V-252" will be fine.

08:18.680 --> 08:19.930
And I'll get on it.

08:20.023 --> 08:21.648
Later, Pete.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.984
Hey, Aunt May.
No, I won't be home for awhile.

08:25.032 --> 08:26.952
I need to let something
charge a few more hours.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.203
Yeah. I guess
I can bring it home.

08:32.407 --> 08:33.443
A jacket?

08:33.602 --> 08:35.508
It's the middle of summer.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.109
Sure. I can stop
at the grocery store.

08:39.469 --> 08:42.179
What do you need? Huh?

08:42.774 --> 08:44.438
No. I'm here.

08:44.963 --> 08:47.696
Thought I heard something.

08:48.524 --> 08:51.282
And you know what?
I will wear that jacket.

08:51.617 --> 08:53.164
I just got a chill.

08:56.489 --> 08:58.880
Hey, Aunt May.
As promised.

09:01.411 --> 09:03.911
Oh, Peter,
you're freezing.

09:03.989 --> 09:06.645
I told you to wear a jacket.
I did.

09:06.833 --> 09:10.122
You worry too much. I'll be
working in my room until dinner.

09:12.872 --> 09:15.114
Better get down to business.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.489
And now we wait.

09:25.364 --> 09:27.279
Dinner's almost ready,
Peter.

09:28.249 --> 09:29.513
Hmm?

09:31.015 --> 09:33.325
Yes! You're starting
to stack.

09:34.529 --> 09:37.220
Huh? Where do you think
you're going?

09:41.931 --> 09:43.043
Oh, no.

09:43.747 --> 09:44.891
Aunt May?

09:44.939 --> 09:46.523
I shouldn't have
brought this home.

09:48.464 --> 09:50.136
S-Sand creature!

09:51.405 --> 09:52.920
Get away from her!

09:56.876 --> 09:59.072
S-Spider creature!

10:00.474 --> 10:03.970
- No! I'm here to help!
- d to vacate the premises.

10:04.095 --> 10:07.556
Not without Peter!
Peter, are you okay?

10:08.696 --> 10:10.466
Give it to me!

10:10.549 --> 10:11.931
I'm fine, Aunt May.

10:12.126 --> 10:14.767
Run next door to Mrs. Watson's
and call the police.

10:14.923 --> 10:16.533
I'll head out the window.

10:17.514 --> 10:18.743
Gotcha!

10:18.791 --> 10:19.883
Whoa!

10:23.040 --> 10:26.438
Is this what you want?
Then come and get it!

10:30.850 --> 10:32.988
Ignore what
you're about to see.

10:34.097 --> 10:36.673
Help me! Stop!
Give it back!

10:36.709 --> 10:38.549
I've been hoping to get
to the beach this year.

10:38.596 --> 10:41.035
Never thought the beach
would come to me.

10:47.317 --> 10:49.535
Oh, look! A sandbox
that isn't attacking me.

10:49.722 --> 10:51.965
Whoa!
Let alone fought in one.

10:52.145 --> 10:54.412
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

10:54.533 --> 10:57.996
Actually, maybe I do.
I hope this is not a mistake.

10:59.580 --> 11:02.247
And since we're far enough away
from putting anyone at risk...

11:04.344 --> 11:06.980
Okay, maybe this was
a mistake.

11:12.542 --> 11:14.442
Now we're talking.

11:14.644 --> 11:15.645
What?

11:15.863 --> 11:18.651
I'm me again.
How did you...

11:18.699 --> 11:21.402
I ionized a sample of
your sand by charging it.

11:21.450 --> 11:23.816
Helped it coagulate. When it
reunited with the rest of you,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.738
the remaining particles
followed suit.

11:25.812 --> 11:29.781
Oh, I never thought I'd be
the old me ever again.

11:29.895 --> 11:33.126
And who would that be,
if you don't mind me asking?

11:34.438 --> 11:35.832
Flint Marko.

11:35.868 --> 11:38.283
What?
You're still made of sand,

11:38.331 --> 11:39.650
but by charging
the particles,

11:39.698 --> 11:42.398
now you're able to retain
a more human form.

11:42.608 --> 11:44.508
You'll get better
at controlling it.

11:44.642 --> 11:46.447
I can't believe you helped me

11:46.496 --> 11:48.275
when I was so out of control.

11:48.414 --> 11:50.448
It's what you asked for,
wasn't it?

11:50.630 --> 11:53.470
Of course, it would've
been easier to ask for help

11:53.607 --> 11:55.611
before you ravaged
Coney Island.

11:55.767 --> 11:58.861
I was trying to reach
my daughter...

11:58.996 --> 12:00.767
Keemia.

12:01.460 --> 12:04.345
The girl on the Ferris wheel.
The one you were chasing.

12:04.439 --> 12:06.056
Trying to protect.

12:06.168 --> 12:08.268
From the people
who did this to me.

12:08.490 --> 12:11.189
I should've never brought
those monsters into my home.

12:11.306 --> 12:14.736
Yeah. I understand more than you think.
What happened to you?

12:14.807 --> 12:17.345
I worked for this guy
named Hammerhead.

12:17.419 --> 12:21.142
I've heard of him. Not someone I'd
recommend doing business with.

12:21.494 --> 12:23.661
He gave me a job
when nobody else would.

12:23.821 --> 12:25.626
Helped me provide
for my daughter.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.644
When I messed up too many times,
he taught me a lesson.

12:31.757 --> 12:35.290
<i>Told me to meet him at a
chemical plant in New Jersey.</i>

12:35.946 --> 12:38.369
Wait here.
I won't be long.

12:45.314 --> 12:47.447
<i>And when I got inside...</i>

12:48.841 --> 12:51.908
You've disappointed me
for the last time, Marko.

12:52.072 --> 12:55.423
Lettin' my financial ledger
fall into the wrong hands...

12:55.747 --> 12:57.781
That was the last straw.

12:58.008 --> 13:00.541
Hammerhead,
it wasn't my fault.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.687
Let me explain.
Let me...

13:05.691 --> 13:07.390
No. No!

13:10.021 --> 13:13.729
<i>Buried me under a ton of sand
and toxic waste.</i>

13:14.520 --> 13:16.787
Hammerhead thought I was dead.

13:16.955 --> 13:20.338
Turns out, I was... this.

13:20.454 --> 13:22.291
Now things
have gotten worse.

13:22.355 --> 13:24.355
How's that
even possible?

13:24.610 --> 13:27.385
Because Hammerhead took Keemia.

13:27.508 --> 13:31.846
But now that you've helped me
retain my form, I can rescue her.

13:31.924 --> 13:35.111
Correction.
<i>We</i> can rescue her.

13:35.877 --> 13:38.722
Yep. That looks like
a Mob boss stronghold.

13:38.799 --> 13:41.491
Complete with thick-necked goons
and everything.

13:47.974 --> 13:49.055
Door's locked.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.226
Don't wanna draw any attention.
You wait here.

13:51.307 --> 13:54.275
I'll crawl up to the roof, see
if I can make my way in, and...

13:56.931 --> 13:58.231
You say something?

13:58.279 --> 14:00.251
Or we can do it your way.

14:00.556 --> 14:03.564
Let's get her and get
outta here before anyone notices.

14:05.033 --> 14:06.599
There she is.

14:06.883 --> 14:08.251
Keemia.

14:08.813 --> 14:09.879
Dad?

14:10.517 --> 14:11.923
Oh, it's me, Keemia.

14:12.110 --> 14:13.511
It's really me.

14:13.822 --> 14:15.953
I never thought I'd see
your face again.

14:16.001 --> 14:17.376
I'm sorry...

14:17.557 --> 14:22.033
So I'm glad I got the
chance to finally do that!

14:22.314 --> 14:23.954
What's the matter, Dad?

14:24.064 --> 14:27.599
You always said,
"Like father, like daughter!"

14:32.606 --> 14:35.923
Keemia?
But... But how?

14:36.105 --> 14:39.001
Actually, I would also like
to know what's going on here.

14:39.092 --> 14:42.165
Stay out of this, Spider-Man.
What's going on?

14:42.438 --> 14:44.826
This doesn't concern you.

14:46.554 --> 14:49.254
Uh, it does when you unleash
a sandstorm at my head.

14:55.409 --> 14:57.688
You haven't
figured it out, Dad?

14:57.833 --> 14:59.681
Oh, who am I kidding?

14:59.751 --> 15:02.845
You couldn't even figure out
how to form before now.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.970
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:05.059 --> 15:07.180
I came here to protect you.

15:07.305 --> 15:08.969
Protect me?

15:09.383 --> 15:11.376
You're a little late
for that, Dad.

15:13.492 --> 15:16.242
I'm stuck.

15:16.290 --> 15:19.414
If you were so
interested in my safety,

15:19.539 --> 15:23.547
you wouldn't have brought me with
you the night of the accident.

15:26.208 --> 15:29.060
<i>You know I didn't
approve of your line of work,</i>

15:29.176 --> 15:31.130
<i>but you brought me
along anyway.</i>

15:31.219 --> 15:34.120
<i>I hated what you did,
and I swore I'd use my brains</i>

15:34.232 --> 15:35.935
<i>to give myself a better life.</i>

15:35.998 --> 15:38.381
<i>But when I got creeped out
sitting alone in the dark,</i>

15:38.506 --> 15:41.303
<i>I did the one thing
I said I'd never do.</i>

15:42.076 --> 15:44.959
<i>I followed
in my father's footsteps.</i>

15:45.007 --> 15:47.637
<i>As a result,
all the studying I did,</i>

15:47.685 --> 15:50.162
<i>all the high grades I got
didn't matter...</i>

15:50.218 --> 15:53.178
You've disappointed
me for the last time, Marko.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.857
Let me explain. Let me... No.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.881
No! Nooooo!

15:59.226 --> 16:01.873
<i>Because my fate was sealed...</i>

16:03.590 --> 16:05.052
<i>in sand.</i>

16:08.170 --> 16:10.021
<i>When Hammerhead
found my body,</i>

16:10.073 --> 16:13.411
<i>he saw no reason why I should
pay for my father's mistakes,</i>

16:13.459 --> 16:15.373
<i>and he took pity on me.</i>

16:15.482 --> 16:18.029
<i>Together, with his money
and my knowledge of science,</i>

16:18.077 --> 16:21.810
<i>we found a way to charge my
particles so that I could live...</i>

16:23.599 --> 16:25.271
like this!

16:25.916 --> 16:28.396
You robbed me
of a better life, Dad.

16:28.498 --> 16:31.115
So if I can't be
a better person than you,

16:31.248 --> 16:33.458
I'll be a better sand person.

16:34.241 --> 16:37.296
Keep her talking, Flint.
Almost have an arm loose.

16:37.373 --> 16:39.724
Keemia, listen to me.

16:39.865 --> 16:43.459
Hammerhead is the one who's
to blame for this, not me.

16:43.553 --> 16:47.920
I took those jobs so that I could
provide you with a better life.

16:48.162 --> 16:50.123
But did you? No.

16:50.243 --> 16:53.044
Hammerhead is the only one
who's ever helped me.

16:53.168 --> 16:55.692
By making me the best version
of what's left of me.

16:55.841 --> 16:58.622
By doing the things
a father does.

16:59.278 --> 17:00.739
Oh, that's not gonna help.

17:02.606 --> 17:04.661
I hate to say it, Marko,

17:04.840 --> 17:07.092
but, uh, I think this sand

17:07.200 --> 17:09.426
has slipped
through your fingers.

17:09.598 --> 17:10.973
Hammerhead!

17:15.040 --> 17:18.101
Come on, Spidey.
Wriggle faster.

17:31.410 --> 17:33.191
Don't settle
for this life.

17:33.699 --> 17:36.308
You can still have
the future you want.

17:37.291 --> 17:39.566
That's impossible!

17:39.691 --> 17:41.588
Keemia, listen to him!

17:41.636 --> 17:45.894
Aaahh! I hate you!

17:46.106 --> 17:48.406
Why couldn't you be the father
you said y

17:49.652 --> 17:52.136
Keemia, stop!
Flint, fight back!

17:53.261 --> 17:55.113
I'm sorry, Keemia.

17:56.753 --> 17:59.611
Aaahh!

18:05.297 --> 18:07.695
You failed me!

18:08.498 --> 18:11.039
I love you, Keemia.

18:11.688 --> 18:13.781
I'm so sorry.

18:17.711 --> 18:19.164
No!

18:26.555 --> 18:28.727
All this sand's
clogged up my shooters.

18:28.961 --> 18:31.828
We can work this out, sand...
girl. Don't worry, boys.

18:32.009 --> 18:34.298
This one's mine.

18:36.578 --> 18:37.836
Whoa!

18:43.226 --> 18:46.023
You should've
stayed out of this.

18:46.187 --> 18:48.750
Good-bye, Spider-Man.

18:48.812 --> 18:51.256
Not good.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.434
Can't... breathe...

19:05.145 --> 19:06.445
- Huh?
- Huh?

19:08.622 --> 19:10.568
Hello, second wind!

19:10.802 --> 19:14.013
I'm as surprised as you, boys,
but I'm going with it.

19:16.423 --> 19:19.965
This looks and feels
just the like the V-252.

19:20.013 --> 19:21.919
But how did it
wind up on me?

19:22.208 --> 19:24.917
Well, don't look a gift
super-suit in the mouth.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.146
Unless you want a broken jaw,
that is.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.872
You ready
try this again?

19:45.083 --> 19:47.255
Aw, did that hurt?

19:47.396 --> 19:49.068
Sure sounded like it did.

19:49.711 --> 19:51.969
Now you're coming with me.

19:52.678 --> 19:54.645
No, no, no!

19:58.596 --> 20:01.245
That sand family
really can't keep it together.

20:06.507 --> 20:10.050
Well, at least
tonight wasn't a total loss.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.643
Very funny.

20:26.609 --> 20:30.655
Insurance agent says he's not sure
we're covered for sandstorms.

20:30.788 --> 20:32.593
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

20:33.062 --> 20:34.710
Oh, not your fault.

20:34.913 --> 20:37.929
You're not the one who brought
that sand thing here.

20:38.476 --> 20:40.069
Uh, right.

20:40.210 --> 20:41.780
<i>That was dumb of me.</i>

20:41.924 --> 20:45.197
<i>Have to remember that Spider-Man's
life is a dangerous one.</i>

20:45.304 --> 20:47.124
<i>I need to keep
my home life out of it.</i>

20:47.314 --> 20:49.202
<i>There's no telling
who could show up.</i>

20:49.353 --> 20:51.370
<i>Or if they'll return.</i>

20:51.562 --> 20:54.062
<i>But from what I've experienced
in the last few hours,</i>

20:54.312 --> 20:56.148
<i>I'd say I'd be ready for them.</i>

20:56.202 --> 20:58.323
Don't be late for school.

21:00.396 --> 21:02.007
I won't.

21:06.304 --> 21:07.757
Morning, guys.
What's up?

21:07.882 --> 21:09.726
You tell us, Parker.

21:09.851 --> 21:13.507
The V-252 is missing, and you
were the last one with it.

21:13.694 --> 21:15.562
Modell is gonna freak out.

21:15.687 --> 21:19.343
And we can forget about any
chance of winning the Stark Expo.

21:19.648 --> 21:23.101
Okay. Relax. I'm sure it'll show up.

If you're so sure, then why don't
you head up the investigation?

21:27.788 --> 21:29.999
I'm all over it.
