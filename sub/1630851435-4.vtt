WEBVTT

01:44.104 --> 01:47.023
Bastards! What are you, ladies?

01:47.107 --> 01:49.526
Getting ready for a party or something?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.319
Stop dilly-dallying!

01:51.402 --> 01:53.905
Do you want to be kicked, you slugs?

01:56.741 --> 01:58.409
All rooms report!

01:58.493 --> 01:59.953
Room one, present!

02:00.036 --> 02:01.162
Room two, present!

02:01.746 --> 02:03.039
Room three, present!

02:03.123 --> 02:04.165
Present!

02:04.249 --> 02:05.542
Present!

02:05.625 --> 02:07.168
It's like the military.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.922
Needless to say, you're all human scum!

02:11.506 --> 02:14.259
You've no right to talk.
Chatting is strictly prohibited!

02:14.342 --> 02:15.927
Violation is a serious crime.

02:16.010 --> 02:17.929
We'll shoot to kill without warning.

02:18.012 --> 02:20.598
Curse yourselves for being born stupid!

02:23.601 --> 02:24.435
It…

02:26.312 --> 02:29.941
was an unusual sight, unfit for prison.

02:31.025 --> 02:33.153
You have no freedom.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.946
That's your life!

02:35.530 --> 02:37.490
There's only one way to survive!

02:38.032 --> 02:39.826
Get used to the discomfort!

02:46.416 --> 02:47.709
Understood?

02:47.792 --> 02:49.169
Yes, sir!

02:49.794 --> 02:50.795
No way!

02:51.838 --> 02:53.715
Why is he smoking like it's normal?

02:57.844 --> 02:58.970
What's for breakfast?

02:59.846 --> 03:01.514
Pork and beans.

03:03.057 --> 03:05.685
I said no personal talk!

03:06.436 --> 03:07.729
Oh, man.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.773
I'm not very fond of pork.

03:11.441 --> 03:12.650
Move to the dining hall!

03:14.944 --> 03:19.365
The way the guards behaved
as if Mr. Second didn't exist

03:19.449 --> 03:20.783
only made it stranger.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.870
He was the only one with an omelette.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.956
There were a thousand prisoners there

03:27.457 --> 03:29.334
but no one complained about it.

03:30.543 --> 03:31.377
And…

03:33.755 --> 03:34.881
Hey.

03:35.632 --> 03:36.841
Did you change your gun?

03:42.222 --> 03:44.140
You had a revolver before.

03:44.849 --> 03:47.518
You switched to an automatic, huh?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.657
We can't have a fly in the dining hall.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.497
Let it go outside.

04:12.961 --> 04:15.546
And the decisive blow that day

04:16.297 --> 04:18.967
was given by the man
sitting across from Second.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.095
Look toward Second.

04:23.846 --> 04:27.558
The man sitting across from Second
plans on challenging him.

04:28.559 --> 04:29.602
He's big.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.439
He has a background
in your country's sumo wrestling.

04:34.148 --> 04:37.568
He switched to mixed martial arts
and in just a few matches,

04:37.652 --> 04:39.570
he climbed to the champion spot.

04:40.196 --> 04:43.574
He displayed that excessive power
in the streets.

04:43.658 --> 04:45.576
His crime was injury resulting in death.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.831
He's never lost in a fight
in Japan nor in the States.

04:49.914 --> 04:53.459
That's the case
for most of the ones in prison, though.

04:54.252 --> 04:55.586
Mr. Second,

04:55.670 --> 04:57.588
I hear that's what you're called.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.848
If you're called, "Second,"

05:06.931 --> 05:10.601
maybe I should call myself "First."

05:11.477 --> 05:12.520
This is hard to use.

05:24.699 --> 05:26.868
The reaction around him is muted.

05:27.535 --> 05:30.621
Everyone knows what's going to happen.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.583
This…

05:34.792 --> 05:35.626
See?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.670
See how pliable it is?

05:38.713 --> 05:40.131
It's jiggly.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.632
Hey.

05:43.217 --> 05:44.135
See?

05:47.972 --> 05:49.390
It's about to begin.

05:56.564 --> 05:57.398
Freeze!

05:59.984 --> 06:05.156
You'll have to use strength and
not magic tricks to get by, Mr. Second.

06:06.657 --> 06:09.744
What will you gain by defeating me?

06:11.329 --> 06:14.832
Some freedom
within this confinement at least.

06:15.750 --> 06:20.213
Mealtime is the one thing
those here look forward to.

06:20.296 --> 06:21.923
You've taken that away.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.925
That's a serious crime.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.932
I'm going to take your freedom away.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.518
I can't bear to watch.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.687
Good idea.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.691
If you give me a gun,
you'll have an excuse when you lose.

06:49.283 --> 06:51.369
Hold it tight.

06:51.869 --> 06:53.204
Aim to kill.

06:53.955 --> 06:54.956
Go ahead.

06:56.624 --> 06:57.959
Damn bastard.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.339
Do you think I won't shoot?

07:05.925 --> 07:07.260
Poor man.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.264
Other than pulling the trigger,
he has no freedom.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.016
It's just what Second wants.

07:15.643 --> 07:17.520
It's a good day to die.

07:18.312 --> 07:19.605
Is that Kenpo?

07:19.689 --> 07:20.523
No.

07:21.149 --> 07:23.401
Second follows no style of fighting.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.533
What did you use?

07:31.159 --> 07:32.285
What did I use?

07:38.124 --> 07:39.041
Sumo?

07:41.169 --> 07:42.545
You bastard.

07:43.129 --> 07:45.047
You think you beat me with Sumo?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.301
Of course that wasn't Sumo earlier.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.594
I kicked you, after all.

07:50.428 --> 07:51.262
But…

07:52.388 --> 07:56.058
I can fight you in Sumo if you wish.

07:58.644 --> 08:01.564
Guard, I'd like to get
some after-meal exercise with him.

08:02.231 --> 08:03.649
We're going to use the gym.

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
We have official approval.

08:08.154 --> 08:09.155
Shall we go?

08:14.410 --> 08:17.163
There's even a perfect circle.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.585
What an anxious group.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.841
Don't worry about them,
they're just bystanders.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.762
Arizona Grand Sumo Tournament, dosukoi!

08:33.930 --> 08:36.849
Does this mean we've started?

08:37.433 --> 08:39.644
"Hakkeyoi," was that the term?

08:42.230 --> 08:43.356
All right.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.866
I can't lift him?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.369
There's no way you can move me.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.872
Not when you're
just standing on the ground.

09:30.736 --> 09:32.154
I'm tipping over.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.156
I'm about to fall.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.742
I have to stay standing.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.664
Game over.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.421
I lost?

09:48.504 --> 09:50.673
I lost in Sumo?

09:51.716 --> 09:53.634
What kind of move was it?

09:53.718 --> 09:54.552
Slapping?

09:55.511 --> 09:58.514
There's something in my ear…

09:59.890 --> 10:01.517
I won't accept this!

10:36.427 --> 10:37.261
Hey.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.890
What are you doing here all alone?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.099
What?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.518
You see that sign, don't you?

10:46.437 --> 10:49.357
Normally, I'd shoot without warning,

10:49.982 --> 10:52.860
but since you're new, I'll overlook it.

10:58.949 --> 11:00.701
I gave you a warning.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.378
Oh, Mr. Baki.

11:10.461 --> 11:11.754
Terrible meal, right?

11:12.421 --> 11:13.339
I heard.

11:13.881 --> 11:18.177
I thought you were "Mr. Second"
because you were the number two,

11:18.260 --> 11:19.387
but that's not why.

11:20.221 --> 11:21.263
That's right.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.265
"Second" means second generation.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.727
Second generation to Mr. Unchained.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.771
The first generation is still here.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.732
Mr. Oliva's time is over.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.276
That's what everyone wants too.

11:34.985 --> 11:40.282
No one actually approves
of that ridiculous lifestyle of his.

11:40.950 --> 11:44.036
He continues to get what he wants
by just using force.

11:44.745 --> 11:49.041
Oliva and Bosch
are both Americans, after all.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.794
And you're different?

11:55.381 --> 11:58.300
You talk too much.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.802
Talking is prohibited!

12:05.349 --> 12:06.809
This baton…

12:09.311 --> 12:11.313
-Is jiggly.
-Don't move!

12:16.402 --> 12:17.570
Okay.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.218
Mealtime!

12:55.107 --> 12:55.941
Shh.

13:06.243 --> 13:09.246
Your meal is only bread and a cup of soup.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.208
There's no need for a fork or knife.

13:12.708 --> 13:16.879
Besides, you can't even
use a spoon in that state.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.759
Your first day
and you're getting quite the treatment.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.719
That man…

13:23.803 --> 13:25.387
Mr. Second.

13:26.055 --> 13:27.389
Who is he?

13:28.599 --> 13:30.142
He's a president.

13:31.685 --> 13:35.231
But of a country no one knows.

13:36.857 --> 13:40.402
It once used to be just an island
off South America.

13:40.486 --> 13:44.657
A tiny country
with a population of less than 20,000.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.159
True name, Jun Guevaru.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.829
A 21-year-old third generation Nikkei.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.998
I don't know Kanji characters,

13:53.082 --> 13:54.792
but the "Jun" was like this.

13:57.336 --> 13:59.004
The character meaning "pure"?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.175
He goes by J. Guevaru in English.

14:03.259 --> 14:09.181
He was originally a stealing,
blackmailing, out-of-hand hoodlum.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.475
That's a common story.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.519
No, it's not.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.022
Guevaru's mischiefs,

14:18.023 --> 14:19.525
weren't in the streets,

14:20.276 --> 14:21.110
but the ocean.

14:22.152 --> 14:24.154
It other words, he was a pirate.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.948
What? A pirate?

14:26.532 --> 14:28.742
His method was simple.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.453
He'd block the path
of a cruise ship to make it stop.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.455
Using ropes…

14:36.041 --> 14:39.420
he'd invade and suppress all at once,

14:40.588 --> 14:42.131
steal their money and goods.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.384
If the story ended there,

14:45.467 --> 14:48.971
he would've just been Guevaru,
the young hoodlum.

14:50.055 --> 14:53.100
But at seventeen,
a turning point came to Guevaru.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.938
What Guevaru saw

14:58.522 --> 15:01.859
was the sight of most people
using their money and power,

15:01.942 --> 15:04.987
to treat the islanders like slaves.

15:05.988 --> 15:11.619
On the island,
people of all ages  worked together.

15:12.161 --> 15:14.246
Necessities were divided equally,

15:14.330 --> 15:17.082
and experiences of joy
and sadness were shared.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.001
But now?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.712
For their meager earnings,

15:21.795 --> 15:24.632
not only were they not treated as equals,

15:25.215 --> 15:26.884
the islanders' pride and culture

15:26.967 --> 15:30.763
were being raped
by the capitalism of the great powers.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.766
That's when Guevaru

15:34.475 --> 15:36.769
aimed for the island's independence.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.689
Since a young age,
Guevaru had been receiving

15:40.773 --> 15:43.275
special martial arts training
from his grandfather.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.528
He began to teach it to his men.

15:47.237 --> 15:50.032
He forbade the use of weapons.

15:50.741 --> 15:54.662
He wasn't trying to impart
some naive sense of justice.

15:54.745 --> 15:59.041
Guevaru's project was backed
by his conviction in victory.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.753
Guevaru's training
intensified competition.

16:05.506 --> 16:06.632
Against bare fists.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.634
Against weapons.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.761
Against projectiles.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.805
Against explosives.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.308
The number of casualties increased,

16:17.101 --> 16:20.396
but they say no one chose to quit.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.649
That's how much Guevaru's plan

16:23.732 --> 16:26.568
gave them the taste of victory.

16:27.486 --> 16:31.073
Around the time the members
stopped getting scars on their bodies,

16:31.156 --> 16:34.410
Guevaru's weaponless army was completed.

16:35.160 --> 16:38.205
Guevaru immediately led
the movement for independence,

16:39.456 --> 16:43.335
but because he was so young,
the citizens only half-believed him.

16:43.919 --> 16:48.340
But the one who hated his action
more than anyone,

16:48.424 --> 16:50.342
was none other than George Bosch.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.931
Say, can't we do something
about that island?

16:56.557 --> 16:59.560
I hear there's talk of independence.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.355
That's when the incident happened.

17:03.439 --> 17:05.858
Can't we take out a carrier or something?

17:05.941 --> 17:08.277
Have it fly back and forth a few times?

17:08.360 --> 17:11.363
Then it could skim the ground and bam!

17:11.447 --> 17:14.366
A tiny island like that
would only take one shot.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.411
If I may, Mr. President.

17:17.494 --> 17:21.373
In general, independence
is something that should be respected.

17:21.999 --> 17:26.086
As long as the leader
and the people's goals are unified.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.379
Deputy James,

17:28.088 --> 17:32.342
we aren't in front of a camera
with the citizens watching.

17:32.426 --> 17:34.178
Read the room.

17:34.720 --> 17:39.391
Are you okay with a defector
from the United States?

17:40.392 --> 17:41.351
Defector?

17:42.478 --> 17:44.063
It's not independence.

17:44.146 --> 17:48.150
This is 20,000 people defecting.

17:48.776 --> 17:53.238
Is that really okay
for the world's greatest nation?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.408
Let's send troops into the island
for the time being.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.953
Under the pretext of suppressing a coup.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.916
We won't let them say otherwise.
We can control the media.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.669
I knew you had potential, Secretary Ray.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.507
Defense Secretary,
how long to get the military ready?

18:12.049 --> 18:14.426
If it's the President's order, by today.

18:14.510 --> 18:18.388
This is it! The frontier spirit!

18:20.182 --> 18:21.433
That's enough.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.685
Freeze!

18:25.813 --> 18:31.693
Move and the President's
cervical spine will do a 360 turn.

18:32.402 --> 18:36.949
The three guards will stand
facing the wall and raise your arms.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.451
Hurry up!

18:41.161 --> 18:42.454
Y-You're…

18:43.330 --> 18:45.082
Chamomile Lessen.

18:45.165 --> 18:48.961
Of course,
I'm on your personal security detail, and…

18:49.837 --> 18:53.882
I'm also a native of the current topic,
that tiny island.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.717
I am one of J. Guevaru's men.

19:00.806 --> 19:04.643
We just wish for our humble independence.

19:05.352 --> 19:07.479
We want you
to quietly stand by and watch.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.608
You're not using a weapon right now,

19:11.692 --> 19:14.236
you think you can get away with this?

19:14.903 --> 19:16.989
There are 50 US states.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.824
Currently, including myself,

19:18.907 --> 19:21.618
we've completed placing
two of us in every state.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.745
And all of us,

19:24.329 --> 19:27.040
can hijack a plane bare-handed,

19:27.124 --> 19:30.752
or seize a nuclear plant.

19:31.378 --> 19:33.755
Of course, that goes for me as well.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.017
Pardon me.

19:46.435 --> 19:50.522
The stubborn cold wave has gone silent.

19:51.190 --> 19:54.651
It finally feels like
there's a gentle breeze

19:54.735 --> 19:58.030
whispering in my ear, here in Califonia.

19:58.614 --> 19:59.865
That's my house!

20:00.574 --> 20:02.034
Today,

20:02.618 --> 20:05.287
I've come to visit
the home of George Bosch,

20:05.370 --> 20:08.540
a country boy from the farms of Alabama.

20:08.624 --> 20:11.043
What's going on?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.545
Thanks for having me.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.215
Oh, my.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.801
The missus and the family
are welcoming me with smiles.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.054
What an American smile.

20:22.638 --> 20:26.934
In the unnecessarily spacious living room,
sunlight filters in the atrium.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.520
It reminds me of
the Alabama sun and my parents.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.440
I'm grateful to my parents.

20:33.523 --> 20:34.942
I love my family.

20:35.484 --> 20:36.777
I love my country.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.655
I love humanity.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.573
Where's security?

20:42.532 --> 20:44.368
Son, do you love your dad?

20:44.868 --> 20:45.827
I love him!

20:47.204 --> 20:49.164
Me too!

20:51.917 --> 20:54.795
What did you think of the Bosch residence?

20:54.878 --> 20:57.256
Reflect on an overly arrogant life.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.342
Pause for a moment
and look back at your blind spot.

21:00.884 --> 21:03.136
I have a feeling it won't go to waste.

21:05.472 --> 21:06.932
All right, see you.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.602
Of course, this is live.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.398
We are on equal footing with the US.

21:15.774 --> 21:19.861
As long as our rights are not violated,
I will guarantee your safety.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.114
Please consider.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.326
I understand.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.578
Okay.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.372
Mission complete.

21:31.456 --> 21:34.418
Guevaru did what everyone
thought impossible,

21:34.501 --> 21:37.879
he won independence as equals.

21:38.630 --> 21:43.468
But why would
a man like that be in prison?

21:43.552 --> 21:44.886
It's simple.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.222
Who's here?

21:48.515 --> 21:49.641
That's right.

21:50.392 --> 21:53.353
The strongest fighter in America,

21:53.437 --> 21:55.397
Biscuit Oliva is here.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.319
A weaponless man
on equal ground as George Bosch.

22:00.944 --> 22:03.655
For Bosch, Oliva is a thorn in his side.

22:03.739 --> 22:07.242
So he's going to stop Oliva
with his bare hands.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.870
It's an attractive fight for Guevaru.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.664
He wants to fight Oliva.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.542
There are a multitude of men
like that in this prison.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.963
Same as you, Baki.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.179
