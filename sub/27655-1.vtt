00:39.289 --> 00:42.532
GERMANY, APRIL 1945

00:42.626 --> 00:48.542
TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THE END OF THE WAR

02:06.251 --> 02:07.833
Move!

02:07.919 --> 02:10.160
Where is that little piggy?

02:14.134 --> 02:15.966
Come on now!

02:16.136 --> 02:17.877
Where is he?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.230
Where is that little piggy?

05:28.870 --> 05:34.832
LOOTING WILL BE PUNISHED BY DEATH!

05:40.715 --> 05:42.422
Let's go.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.645
That just means
there's still something to be had.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.102
Do it!

06:39.149 --> 06:42.267
Thieves! Thieves! He's getting away!

06:42.444 --> 06:44.026
I'll kill you!

10:07.607 --> 10:12.602
<i>This is too good to be true</i>

10:12.779 --> 10:15.146
<i>Like a miracle</i>

10:15.323 --> 10:17.155
<i>Shines down upon us</i>

10:17.700 --> 10:22.035
<i>From paradise, a golden ray</i>

10:22.122 --> 10:25.285
Thank you.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.789
Thanks so very, very much.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.176
Just who do you think you are?

10:47.689 --> 10:50.101
Who do you think you are?

10:51.359 --> 10:53.225
What's this?

10:53.403 --> 10:55.189
Your pants are too long.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.145
Sorry.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.813
Sorry, Captain.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.367
What did you say?

11:06.457 --> 11:08.664
What did you say, huh?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.286
I want you to run.

11:12.380 --> 11:13.870
Run.

11:14.507 --> 11:18.171
Go on. You'll get your chance.
Run! I want you to run.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.169
Get going. Run!

11:20.305 --> 11:24.094
Run for your life, little piggy.
Get going, run.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.558
Private Walter Freytag
reporting for duty, Captain!

12:13.650 --> 12:15.311
Lost my unit.

12:15.526 --> 12:18.860
Requesting permission
to be attached to the Captain.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.659
The car is stuck?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.700
I'll get you out of that muck, Captain.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.605
Just who do you think you are?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.283
Let me see your papers.

14:05.219 --> 14:07.586
- I lost my unit...
- Keep quiet.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.895
You deserted.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.562
No, Captain.

14:25.656 --> 14:27.397
I got separated.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.567
We were engaged in heavy combat.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.739
Half of the...

14:50.848 --> 14:52.714
You look hungry.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.641
Haven't eaten in three days, Captain.
Very hungry.

15:14.539 --> 15:17.497
All right then. We'll give it a shot.

15:34.809 --> 15:36.720
Better find us an inn.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.303
Yes sir, Captain.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.121
Place is as dark as my asshole, Captain.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.838
All right, let's go.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.648
Don't take it personally, Captain.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.031
People just don't like uniforms anymore.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.656
- Especially not German ones.
- Parasites.

17:29.632 --> 17:34.092
We've heard troubling rumors
about conditions behind the front.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.968
But things appear worse than I feared.

17:57.285 --> 18:00.573
Name?

18:00.705 --> 18:02.946
Schnabel, Gerd, Captain.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.081
Party member since 1932.

18:16.637 --> 18:20.926
Listen, I know we are
in violation of certain regulations.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.513
The roast was a mercy killing.

18:24.604 --> 18:27.187
- The poor animal...
- Relax.

18:27.273 --> 18:31.141
I'm not here to make trouble.
Just tell me what you're owed.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.728
Because of the looting.

18:34.780 --> 18:37.363
What did the deserters steal
and what was it worth?

18:38.868 --> 18:41.075
Please. For your reimbursement.

18:48.044 --> 18:51.708
I'm here to make sure
that everyone gets their money.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.287
Money?

18:53.341 --> 18:58.381
The party still stands for law and order.
Heil Hitler!

19:03.059 --> 19:07.519
- I had two coach horses...
- You don't have horses!

19:07.605 --> 19:10.973
- As I said...
- Any food left? Breakfast was a while ago.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.775
There's even roast left.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.901
Freytag, roast!

19:16.822 --> 19:18.312
Freytag?

19:19.033 --> 19:22.116
There's roast. Give the innkeeper a hand.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.069
Go on now.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.046
They broke my crockery.

20:21.137 --> 20:22.502
My furniture!

20:22.596 --> 20:26.055
- Hope it's tasty, Captain.
- Enjoy, Captain.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.680
Splendid.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.224
This looks splendid.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.772
We'll take a little break.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.521
No worries. Everyone gets their due.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.940
Enjoy.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.907
Indeed.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.655
That I Will.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.647
Captain!

21:26.827 --> 21:28.613
Captain.

21:28.704 --> 21:29.819
We've got one.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.761
He stole food.

21:53.354 --> 21:56.142
- We need some order around here.
- Yes, sir!

22:08.661 --> 22:11.073
Time to earn your roast.

22:32.101 --> 22:33.717
Everyone gets their due.

23:07.177 --> 23:10.090
Here's a candle just in case, Captain.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.058
That was hard.

23:18.272 --> 23:21.890
- Wake me at 0530 sharp tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.895
And...

23:23.986 --> 23:25.772
What about breakfast?

23:26.363 --> 23:28.274
There's some real coffee left in the car.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.775
That's good.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.779
Starting the day
on an empty stomach is no fun.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.370
Thanks.

24:17.831 --> 24:25.831
THE CAPTAIN

24:58.288 --> 25:00.029
Which way, Captain?

25:00.124 --> 25:02.991
- The farm is to the right.
- Yes, Captain.

25:25.691 --> 25:28.683
LOOTING WILL BE PUNISHED BY DEATH!

25:55.220 --> 25:57.632
At attention! Let's go!

25:57.723 --> 25:58.884
Move it!

26:35.427 --> 26:38.761
Let's have a look-see
at your marching orders!

26:55.155 --> 26:57.317
<i>This is Radio Greater Germany.</i>

26:57.407 --> 27:00.240
<i>Our Wehrmacht request show has concluded.</i>

27:18.428 --> 27:21.966
- Your deployment zone is the other way.
- Deserters. I knew it!

27:22.432 --> 27:24.173
Answer!

27:24.268 --> 27:25.303
Spit it out!

27:31.066 --> 27:33.148
Captain, permission to report.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.856
We got separated from our unit.

27:41.118 --> 27:45.282
- And so you just settled in here?
- At my expense! Damn drunks!

27:45.372 --> 27:48.455
MPs are in the next village,
but our phone's out.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.328
He smashed it!

27:52.337 --> 27:53.827
Come on!

28:19.323 --> 28:22.156
You can't just roll over and take it all.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.732
Schnapps!

28:23.827 --> 28:25.613
Yes sir, Captain. Schnapps!

28:34.963 --> 28:37.045
- Captain...
- Did I ask you something?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.187
Well?

28:54.983 --> 28:57.315
Captain, permission to report.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.110
We respectfully request
to be attached to your command.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.236
Okay. Sit down.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.412
I have a mission here behind the front.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.032
I need help.

29:20.300 --> 29:22.917
DETACHMENT “H”

29:24.054 --> 29:25.510
You are going to help me.

29:43.740 --> 29:46.949
To Task Force Herold!
Together we are strong.

30:09.433 --> 30:10.969
Captain.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.766
What exactly is the mission?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.106
To get clarity
on the situation behind the front.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.853
I can give you clarity on that.

30:25.824 --> 30:28.566
The situation
is always what you make of it.

30:28.660 --> 30:29.946
Isn't that right, Captain?

31:31.848 --> 31:33.304
Stop!

31:37.145 --> 31:38.226
Aircraft!

31:52.202 --> 31:53.692
Again!

31:57.958 --> 31:59.619
Keep going.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.492
Captain!

32:44.588 --> 32:46.204
Where exactly is this going?

32:47.841 --> 32:49.957
Our area of deployment is straight ahead.

33:12.574 --> 33:16.192
Military police!
Everyone line up! Papers out!

33:21.333 --> 33:23.324
I won't say it again!

33:40.685 --> 33:42.050
Out!

33:47.150 --> 33:48.606
Just who do you think you are?

33:48.693 --> 33:52.937
As a decorated Luftwaffe captain,
I won't tolerate such disrespect!

33:53.406 --> 33:57.616
- I demand to speak to your CO immediately!
- Sure, right here.

34:04.876 --> 34:07.117
So you won't show your papers?

34:07.212 --> 34:12.252
- To a grunt who treats me like a criminal?
- Where are your marching orders?

34:12.300 --> 34:15.042
- We're on a special mission.
- Special mission?

34:15.136 --> 34:17.878
- To report on conditions behind the front.
- Uh-huh.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.132
- Under what authority?
- Under what authority?

34:22.518 --> 34:24.760
Under the highest authority.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.308
The highest authority.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.690
Under the authority of the Fuhrer himself.

34:36.533 --> 34:41.447
He has heard some alarming rumors
about what's happening around here.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.821
But who am I even talking to?

34:47.460 --> 34:49.201
Sichner, Josef.

34:51.172 --> 34:54.755
Now, if you'll show me your papers,
we can be done with this.

34:54.842 --> 34:57.083
Your paper's got to say something, right?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.427
Fine.

35:08.189 --> 35:10.521
If I may ask to see your papers?

35:11.401 --> 35:16.111
We're of equal rank. I have the same right
to check yours as you do to check mine.

35:16.740 --> 35:20.734
I'll note that in my report as well.
Believe you me, Captain Sichner.

35:32.505 --> 35:33.505
At ease.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.803
Well, you know,

35:42.682 --> 35:47.017
with all the deserters,
you never know who's wearing the uniform.

35:47.062 --> 35:48.348
A travesty.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.271
Freytag, give the men back their papers.

35:51.358 --> 35:56.444
That scum runs around here looting,
so we've set up strict checkpoints.

35:56.571 --> 35:58.278
The fuhrer will be pleased.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.732
You'll have your papers checked
a few more times.

36:12.253 --> 36:16.212
You're right. We need to
teach those looters some manners.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.758
Captain.

36:21.596 --> 36:26.136
I'll join you on your patrol
to get a firsthand view of the situation.

36:26.226 --> 36:29.184
And I'll gladly pitch in where necessary.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.610
Take the men along and tow the car!

37:02.595 --> 37:03.960
Papers!

37:05.056 --> 37:07.343
It's you, Captain Sichner. Heil Hitler!

37:07.434 --> 37:12.349
- We're taking deserters to Work Camp ll.
- Yes, sir! Open up!

37:17.360 --> 37:19.192
Hold on!

37:20.196 --> 37:21.561
Not so fast.

37:22.866 --> 37:25.153
Captain Junker. Heil Hitler!

37:25.702 --> 37:29.696
Captain Herold is on a special mission
to assess the situation behind the front.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.121
- For the Fuhrer himself.
- The Fuhrer?

37:32.917 --> 37:36.126
You can tell the fuhrer
the situation is for shit.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.670
- Work Camp ll?
- Get in.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.430
I brought some pals along.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.808
We've met before, right?

38:06.367 --> 38:07.367
Crete?

38:08.953 --> 38:12.196
- Narvik!
- 1940.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.872
Hairy.

38:14.667 --> 38:17.329
- What branch of the army?
- Airborne.

38:18.379 --> 38:21.087
- You?
- 1940? Poland.

38:22.759 --> 38:25.296
God, Poland in 1940!

38:32.101 --> 38:33.216
I loved it!

38:39.400 --> 38:41.016
I never forget a face.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.370
I'm sure we'll figure it out.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.018
Well, we've got a bit of time.

40:04.861 --> 40:06.727
I'll buy you a drink.

40:07.447 --> 40:10.656
Come on, as long as we're waiting for gas.

40:16.122 --> 40:18.489
It's an unbelievable luxury.

40:18.583 --> 40:22.292
Keeping prisons and work camps going
in times like these.

40:23.546 --> 40:27.756
Nine of ten prisoners are morally corrupt
and a burden to humanity.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.212
Right?

40:30.887 --> 40:33.049
Right. An unbelievable luxury.

40:33.139 --> 40:36.803
When we evacuated the other camps
due to the enemy approach,

40:36.893 --> 40:39.009
all prisoners were brought here!

40:39.103 --> 40:41.970
Now we get to feed them till the courts...

40:42.065 --> 40:43.851
This way.

40:43.900 --> 40:47.564
Until the courts finally see fit
to condemn them.

40:47.654 --> 40:49.190
What do the posters say?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.611
Hey?

40:51.532 --> 40:53.148
What does the party say?

40:54.327 --> 40:56.614
We need to make looters pay.

41:10.093 --> 41:11.379
Captain...

41:12.220 --> 41:16.009
- What was your name again?
- Herold. Captain Willi Herold.

41:16.933 --> 41:18.389
Right.

41:24.524 --> 41:26.515
“Captain Herold.”

41:27.777 --> 41:32.442
- I have to see to my men. My pleasure.
- We'll see to your men.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.499
SA Leader Schütte.

41:44.585 --> 41:48.169
He commands the camp guards.
This is Captain Herold.

41:48.256 --> 41:52.750
Heil Hitler. Am I glad to see you.
Finally, somethings happening.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.962
- We've waited weeks for a court-martial.
- He's not here for a court-martial.

41:57.265 --> 42:00.053
What? He's not?

42:00.727 --> 42:04.641
I... I heard “special mission”
and thought that meant business.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.849
He's reporting
on the situation behind the front,

42:07.900 --> 42:10.813
to the fuhrer himself.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.280
The Fuhrer?

42:15.366 --> 42:19.109
No other. So I've told Captain Herold
about our little “storage issue.”

42:30.089 --> 42:31.579
Oh, yes.

42:32.925 --> 42:35.007
Yes, you see,

42:35.762 --> 42:38.174
with all the escaped prisoners,

42:38.264 --> 42:41.427
we have our own war of sorts
here on the home front.

42:41.559 --> 42:44.267
Even if it's less glamorous
than it is for officers like you.

42:44.353 --> 42:47.345
We all struggle with the same problems.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.853
Just recently I came across a looter.

42:52.862 --> 42:55.570
- And?
- I made him pay.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.569
Yes, like I always say!

43:03.206 --> 43:05.493
Civilians are asking us for help,

43:05.583 --> 43:08.792
because prisoners
break into their homes and loot.

43:08.878 --> 43:13.793
An SA officer's pregnant wife
was mugged and robbed.

43:14.759 --> 43:18.593
Men who desert, steal, plunder
or rape must be condemned!

43:18.679 --> 43:22.513
Amnesty is no longer an option
for escaped inmates.

43:22.600 --> 43:27.515
And we have to make sure they don't fall
into the hands of the enemy.

43:28.856 --> 43:30.642
But the court-martial isn't convening.

43:30.733 --> 43:35.273
The Wehrmacht should call the shots here,
not the courts.

43:35.363 --> 43:39.527
They just talk in circles and assume
it'll all just pass locally.

43:39.617 --> 43:43.952
But where brave soldiers
die wretchedly on the front every day

43:44.038 --> 43:47.497
it's not right that known,
that convicted criminals,

43:47.583 --> 43:51.952
live off the fat of the land
because no one has the guts to end it.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.959
The scum here
is safer than any front soldier.

43:55.049 --> 43:58.292
It'd be so easy to sort out.
All it takes is the will.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.424
Yes, the Captain understands our dilemma.

44:03.641 --> 44:05.052
Right?

44:06.811 --> 44:08.017
Of course.

44:11.149 --> 44:13.186
Such an emergency cannot be ignored.

44:15.069 --> 44:18.687
- So you'll mention it to the Fuhrer?
- Put in a good word.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.605
It would take a load off our shoulders.

44:27.707 --> 44:29.493
Maybe I can do more.

44:35.923 --> 44:39.666
Yes? What do you have in mind?

44:43.639 --> 44:47.052
I don't want to promise anything.
First I need to assess the situation.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.977
And my men need
accommodation and provisions.

44:51.022 --> 44:54.560
You take care of the prisoners,
and we'll look after your men.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.564
All right, let's go.

45:02.658 --> 45:05.571
Take the Captain
to the detention barracks.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.203
I have to clear that with Hansen first.

45:08.289 --> 45:11.782
The warden for the inner sector,
where the inmates are held.

45:11.876 --> 45:16.336
I have no power there.
The Justice Department has authority.

45:26.307 --> 45:29.220
Then I'll have to grant you those powers.

45:29.977 --> 45:34.016
- The judiciary cannot mock the Wehrmacht.
- Excellent!

45:35.650 --> 45:39.814
Well, I have to go.
Schütte, you take over from here.

45:44.325 --> 45:45.235
Fantastic.

45:45.326 --> 45:47.567
Captain Junker!

45:49.247 --> 45:51.705
- Now I really do want to know.
- What?

45:51.791 --> 45:53.998
- Where we've met.
- Oh, yes!

46:03.928 --> 46:05.293
No.

46:06.222 --> 46:07.428
I just can't remember.

46:10.977 --> 46:12.718
Happens, right?

46:13.980 --> 46:15.345
Yes.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.159
If I may show you the way, Captain?

46:38.546 --> 46:40.332
To the detention barracks.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.634
Prisoners who've been recaptured
after escaping are kept separately.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.573
Everyone fall in.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.611
And hurry up!

47:16.625 --> 47:20.243
This scum needs to be taught
discipline and order.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.796
I'm going to see that you swine rot!

47:25.217 --> 47:29.757
I'll get the warden.
You can start interrogating the prisoners.

48:32.868 --> 48:34.700
Did you steal?

48:37.164 --> 48:38.654
Loot?

48:44.380 --> 48:45.711
Rape?

49:00.729 --> 49:03.517
Didn't you hear
what the Captain asked you?

49:05.693 --> 49:07.183
Crime?

49:07.278 --> 49:08.359
Desertion.

49:09.738 --> 49:11.399
Repeated desertion.

49:53.115 --> 49:54.947
Have them line up outside.

50:29.860 --> 50:32.067
All of you empty your pockets.

50:40.120 --> 50:42.578
If you've got nothing, you're next.

50:42.665 --> 50:44.952
Do you have anything?

50:45.042 --> 50:46.703
Do you?

50:46.794 --> 50:48.501
In with it!

50:48.587 --> 50:51.170
That'll do. That'll do too.

50:51.257 --> 50:54.670
Who has something?
You do. Give it here! Out!

50:55.553 --> 50:56.759
Give it here.

51:08.732 --> 51:10.188
You?

51:11.735 --> 51:13.191
You?

51:13.946 --> 51:15.857
You! Give it here!

51:17.324 --> 51:19.315
Give it here now!

51:23.789 --> 51:25.279
Captain!

51:29.086 --> 51:30.827
- Please!
- They're already dead.

51:32.298 --> 51:33.788
Either way.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.326
Yeah!

52:13.505 --> 52:15.246
What is it now?

52:15.341 --> 52:19.175
A Luftwaffe captain wants to see
the prisoners in the detention barracks.

52:20.721 --> 52:22.758
Does he have the necessary authorization?

52:22.848 --> 52:26.807
He has all the authorization he needs,
from the fuhrer.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.720
From the fuhrer himself?

52:36.820 --> 52:41.940
In the inner camp, he must be accompanied
by one of my prison guards.

52:42.034 --> 52:45.368
In the inner camp,
neither you, your SA guard units,

52:45.454 --> 52:48.697
nor the Wehrmacht
have any authority whatsoever.

52:48.791 --> 52:51.408
With your permission, <i>I'll</i> do that.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.084
Well.

52:53.545 --> 52:56.162
That certainly isn't regulation.

52:56.256 --> 52:59.044
- I hope we both know that.
- Of course.

52:59.635 --> 53:02.844
But considering I'm already effectively

53:03.639 --> 53:05.971
the liaison to the Captain.

53:10.354 --> 53:11.890
All right.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.639
I'll be right there.

53:16.527 --> 53:18.393
- Um, Schütte?
- Yes?

53:20.864 --> 53:25.028
Winkler's daughter would like this

53:25.119 --> 53:28.328
personally delivered
to her father in Barrack 4.

53:28.414 --> 53:32.453
- Can you do that for me?
- Certainly, I'm going that way anyway.

53:36.505 --> 53:37.995
Asswipe!

53:51.979 --> 53:54.095
Get out!

53:57.067 --> 53:58.853
I said out!

54:00.738 --> 54:02.194
What are you looking at?

54:03.198 --> 54:04.939
What's with you? Huh?

54:15.961 --> 54:18.248
So you'll convene
the court-martial yourself?

54:20.966 --> 54:24.880
My father always said,
“Finish what you've started.”

54:24.970 --> 54:28.338
Finally, somethings happening! Brockhoff!

54:28.432 --> 54:31.925
Confine all prisoners.
Don't let them near the windows.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.805
Shoot violators on sight!

54:33.896 --> 54:36.809
Post a man every 15 meters
along the barbed wire fence.

54:36.899 --> 54:41.143
And, Brockhoff, dig a trench.
These criminals don't need coffins.

54:41.236 --> 54:42.943
You got it.

54:44.907 --> 54:46.523
Come in.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.985
Heil Hitler! Just take a look at this.

55:30.452 --> 55:31.783
Move! Faster!

55:55.102 --> 55:57.719
What in the hell is going on here?

55:58.856 --> 56:02.440
Herr Hansen, may I present Captain Herold.

56:02.568 --> 56:05.651
Ah, Captain! Do you have papers for this?

56:07.155 --> 56:11.069
The Fuhrer has given me authority
to take all necessary measures

56:11.159 --> 56:13.321
whenever German combat forces are at risk.

56:14.162 --> 56:17.450
The soldier can die,
but the deserter must die.

56:17.541 --> 56:19.532
Yes. Yes, yes.

56:19.626 --> 56:21.913
All the same, I ask you

56:22.004 --> 56:25.622
not to take any further action
for the time being.

56:25.716 --> 56:29.175
Because I must contact my superior.

56:29.219 --> 56:34.055
Since I haven't received any orders
from the Justice Department for this.

56:35.350 --> 56:39.719
Obviously, as an officer,
that must make sense to you.

56:46.987 --> 56:48.193
I'm at your disposal.

56:58.332 --> 57:01.165
Dr. Thiel, it's Hansen from Camp ll.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.200
Yes.

57:03.295 --> 57:06.003
I have a Captain Herold here with me.

57:06.089 --> 57:09.423
He says he has authorization
from the Fuhrer,

57:09.551 --> 57:13.169
and he has already executed
five prisoners.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.381
Yes, within the inner sector.

57:19.061 --> 57:20.768
One moment.

57:20.854 --> 57:26.520
Deputy Special Emissary
for the Justice Department, Dr. Thiel.

57:27.027 --> 57:28.517
Captain Herold.

57:29.279 --> 57:33.739
Five prisoners, yes.
I know the judiciary has authority.

57:33.825 --> 57:36.237
They attacked me during interrogation.

57:36.995 --> 57:38.827
Yes, all five.

57:39.456 --> 57:41.572
Herr Schütte can confirm that.

57:44.169 --> 57:45.910
Indeed I can.

57:46.922 --> 57:49.380
Of course they're guilty beyond doubt

57:49.508 --> 57:52.296
or they wouldn't be
in the detention barracks.

57:53.136 --> 57:54.136
Yes.

57:54.930 --> 57:56.295
Yes.

57:59.309 --> 58:00.309
Yes?

58:02.896 --> 58:04.762
I see.

58:12.155 --> 58:14.442
Dr. Thiel says he would like you

58:14.574 --> 58:18.112
to wait until tomorrow
before taking further steps.

58:18.203 --> 58:21.537
Dr. Thiel says
the statutes are very clear on that.

58:21.623 --> 58:24.536
A court-martial
must be organized properly.

58:24.626 --> 58:30.417
Dr. Thiel will contact
the chief public prosecutor in Oldenburg

58:30.549 --> 58:36.090
and then come out here to discuss things
and check your papers.

58:36.179 --> 58:39.513
- He can check all he wants.
- And he will!

58:43.353 --> 58:46.311
You haven't grasped
the gravity of the situation, Herr Hansen.

58:47.733 --> 58:50.100
- That's for sure!
- I beg your pardon!

58:50.193 --> 58:54.903
It's got to be done properly.
Who wants to take responsibility for this?

58:54.990 --> 58:56.606
Captain Herold!

58:57.117 --> 58:58.699
Captain Herold.

58:58.785 --> 59:02.779
Captain, we can sort this thing out
so everyone is happy.

59:02.873 --> 59:05.490
I know the Gauleiter. If he's on our side,

59:05.584 --> 59:09.373
there'll be no more problems
with the Justice Department.

59:12.758 --> 59:16.217
We'll have no trouble
keeping Dr. Thiel out of this.

59:19.931 --> 59:22.093
Captain Herold.

59:22.726 --> 59:25.844
He has unlimited authority
from the Führer.

59:26.980 --> 59:30.518
That's right,
to put things in order here at the camp.

59:30.609 --> 59:34.398
Yes, the Captain has already
gotten rid of a few of prisoners.

59:35.447 --> 59:37.358
He says, “You've got to start somewhere.”

59:38.408 --> 59:42.367
I agree entirely.
The Justice Department is stonewalling.

59:42.454 --> 59:46.448
But we should definitely clear this
with the gestapo in Emden.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.742
You'll do that?

59:49.836 --> 59:51.372
That's great!

59:53.006 --> 59:57.591
He says, “If Herold is ready to take care
of the matter, it'll save time.”

59:57.677 --> 59:59.259
He'll call back.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.613
Schütte. The Gauleiter.

01:00:22.577 --> 01:00:24.989
Is someone coming from headquarters?

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.039
No, we'll manage on our own.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:35.629
He says, “Break a leg and smooth sailing.”

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:46.049
Dr. Thiel? Yes, Schütte from Camp ll.
Captain Herold wants to speak to you.

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.349
Dr. Thiel?

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:57.901
And entrusted the matter to me.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.690
Everything has been turned over
to the gestapo in Emden.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:11.123
He wants to check with the gestapo
and contact the prosecutor,

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:13.041
then he'll inform Hansen.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.504
<i>Sleep, baby, sleep</i>

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:24.212
<i>Hansen is a sheep</i>

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:34.106
Hansen.

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:37.234
Splendid.

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:42.855
So you're saying that the gestapo

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:47.864
has assigned the matter to Captain Herold
as a simplified court-martial

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:49.786
and is assuming full responsibility?

01:01:58.006 --> 01:01:59.588
I see.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:03.212
So Captain Herold
has the proper authority?

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:07.592
Yes, then nothing can be done.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:11.971
I see.
There is no doubt about his authority.

01:02:13.813 --> 01:02:15.178
Yep.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.353
Yes, I understand. Heil Hitler.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:45.000
All fall in!

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.378
Move!

01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:59.231
Hurry up!

01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:13.662
I was thinking three groups of 30?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.958
Then we'd better get going.

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.534
Let's go!

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.087
Left face!

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:26.212
March!

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:45.854
<i>Today we want to march along</i>

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:49.906
<i>March to a brand new song</i>

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.236
<i>In the Westerwood so old</i>

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:56.618
<i>Oh, the wind it blows so cold</i>

01:03:57.792 --> 01:04:01.126
<i>In the Westerwood so old</i>

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:04.295
<i>Oh, the wind it blows so cold</i>

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:08.341
<i>Oh, you beautiful</i>

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.136
<i>Westerwood!</i>

01:04:11.806 --> 01:04:15.049
<i>O'er your tops, the wind blows cold</i>

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:21.731
<i>Yet the tiniest ray of sunshine
warms our hearts</i>

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:43.999
<i>Because dancing is a delight
and makes your heart cheery and light</i>

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:48.173
<i>Oh, you beautiful</i>

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:50.796
<i>Westerwood!</i>

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:54.634
<i>O'er your tops, the wind blows cold</i>

01:04:54.724 --> 01:05:01.187
<i>Yet the tiniest ray of sunshine
warms our hearts</i>

01:05:02.190 --> 01:05:06.058
<i>And Gretel and Hans</i>

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:09.736
<i>On Sundays, they sure like to dance</i>

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:16.035
<i>Because dancing is a delight
and makes your heart cheery and light</i>

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:22.495
<i>Because dancing is a delight
and makes your heart cheery and light</i>

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:27.083
<i>Oh, you beautiful</i>

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.380
<i>Westerwood!</i>

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:33.218
<i>O'er your tops, the wind blows cold</i>

01:05:33.304 --> 01:05:39.926
<i>Yet the tiniest ray of sunshine
warms our hearts</i>

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:47.225
<i>When the dancing is all done
then usually a brawl is on</i>

01:05:47.318 --> 01:05:53.564
<i>Any lad not keen on that
has no pluck and that's a fact</i>

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:25.353
Reload.

01:06:42.415 --> 01:06:43.905
Jammed.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.339
Flak has shit the bed.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:07:00.631
Everyone, open fire!

01:07:00.725 --> 01:07:02.181
Let's go!

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:56.528
Captain, these proceedings are in no way
according to regulations.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:08:00.778
What you've done here
can only be called a disgrace.

01:08:00.868 --> 01:08:03.576
It's inhumane, and I shall report it.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.390
Back to work.

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.996
Going marvelously, isn't it?

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:27.216
Someone has to go in. You there!

01:10:39.152 --> 01:10:40.358
Freytag!

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:45.026
You get in there!

01:10:47.785 --> 01:10:49.367
Get moving!

01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.743
Get moving!

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:06.418
Make it snappy, damn it!

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.507
Move!

01:11:24.906 --> 01:11:27.318
Put an end to his unnecessary suffering.

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:02.702
Respectfully reporting.
Order executed, Captain.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:09.716
Yes, a complaint regarding
the improper disposal of 90 prisoners.

01:13:11.846 --> 01:13:13.962
- Ninety, Dr. Thiel.
- No. No way!

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.764
- What?
- I'm not cleaning this up.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:18.341
Oh, that.

01:13:18.436 --> 01:13:22.521
Captain Herold has organized
festivities to celebrate the day.

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:26.692
- With some inmates, actors and musicians.
- Pick up that shovel!

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:30.065
- You bastard! Follow orders!
- About the complaint...

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.897
I'll kill you!

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:38.779
- I'll send you into the trench!
- Yes. Yes, I understand.

01:13:38.873 --> 01:13:42.286
- I'm sick of your shit!
- Um, yes. Yes. Agreed.

01:13:42.376 --> 01:13:45.994
- You must be nuts!
- Refusing to obey an order!

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:49.251
- That means death!
- I'll stick this shovel...

01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:51.291
What's going on out there?

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:53.672
A horrible mess is what this is!

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.299
Shut up!

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.300
He can do this crap himself!

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:00.975
The digging detail
is refusing to fill in the trench!

01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:05.139
Then do it yourself!
I want peace and order around here!

01:14:12.907 --> 01:14:17.447
Dr. Thiel says give it to me in writing.
I'll submit it in due order.

01:14:17.578 --> 01:14:20.570
I have to insist
an official report is made.

01:14:20.665 --> 01:14:22.906
I'm powerless here as well.

01:14:24.251 --> 01:14:26.663
Come on. I'll take you into town.

01:14:26.754 --> 01:14:29.837
We can spare ourselves
Herold's festivities.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:33.792
I ask permission to stay away
until Captain Herold has left.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:37.754
Yes, as far <i>as</i> I'm concerned.
It's nearly over anyway.

01:14:37.848 --> 01:14:39.589
Oh, screw off!

01:14:46.941 --> 01:14:50.559
You'll regret this, you swine!
Go on. Get to work.

01:15:05.418 --> 01:15:10.834
- Hip hip...
- Hooray!

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:20.130
In celebration of this day,
there'll be enough schnapps to drown in.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:21.889
For everyone!

01:15:22.601 --> 01:15:25.719
Your hard work will be rewarded.

01:15:26.939 --> 01:15:28.395
Cheers.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:37.982
In two weeks, on April 20, 1945,
the fuhrer's birthday,

01:15:38.075 --> 01:15:41.784
a triumphant German offensive
will bring the turning point.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:44.784
The Fuhrer said it,
and the Fuhrer doesn't lie.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.998
Been with me since she was 15.
Can you believe it, Captain?

01:15:51.088 --> 01:15:54.080
For 20 years now, one heart and one soul.

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:58.590
Like all big cats, I mate only once.
And then it's for life.

01:16:03.267 --> 01:16:05.599
Look! A banana!

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:14.442
- How are you?
- I feel like a Jewish lawyer.

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.608
- How's that?
- I could tell you, but I'd get charged.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.658
- Hey, Rabbi!
- Yes?

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.364
I'd like to know what “relatively” means.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:27.038
- You don't know what “relatively” means?
- No.

01:16:27.124 --> 01:16:29.206
- Should I explain?
- Yes, explain.

01:16:29.293 --> 01:16:32.831
Fine, Moshe.
I'm going to pull my pants down now.

01:16:32.922 --> 01:16:35.004
- Then my underpants.
- And now?

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:37.753
- Now I'll bend forward.
- And what do I do?

01:16:37.843 --> 01:16:42.588
- Now stick your nose right up my ass.
- Do I have to, Rabbi?

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:45.844
Yes, Moshe,
or I can't explain “relatively” to you.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:51.062
- Is your nose right up my ass?
- Yes, my nose is right up your ass.

01:16:51.148 --> 01:16:54.686
Now the both of us have
a nose right up an ass,

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:58.771
but my situation
is “relatively” better than yours.

01:17:01.242 --> 01:17:02.983
Bravo!

01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.528
Oh, that was...

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:08.241
- Oh!
- I'm so hungry.

01:17:08.332 --> 01:17:09.993
- Really?
- Yes, I'm hungry.

01:17:10.084 --> 01:17:13.122
- Do you have food?
- I haven't... No!

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:16.375
A giant sausage.

01:17:18.259 --> 01:17:21.251
It's been so long! Boy, I'm so hungry!

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.882
I'm hungry!
Oh, I'm so hungry.

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.340
No! Oh, no! Oh, God!

01:17:26.433 --> 01:17:28.970
He sure is hungry, but I am too.

01:17:29.019 --> 01:17:31.511
I... Boy, am I hungry too.

01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:40.528
Now I can eat too.

01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.832
They are terrific.

01:18:32.666 --> 01:18:36.409
<i>Band of brothers! Band of brothers!</i>

01:18:38.172 --> 01:18:42.040
<i>It is so lovely and never more found</i>

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:46.803
<i>When a band of brothers is together as we</i>

01:18:47.389 --> 01:18:52.008
<i>The soul cries out
Not a word need be found</i>

01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:56.225
<i>They sense the sacred bond
By which they're bound</i>

01:18:57.191 --> 01:19:01.276
<i>Band of brothers! Band of brothers!</i>

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:06.531
<i>Anyone who's ever heard the grenades</i>

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:11.076
<i>Holds in his heart the brothers he's made</i>

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:16.329
<i>What could ever replace these ties?</i>

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:20.582
<i>They can see it in each other's eyes</i>

01:19:21.757 --> 01:19:25.091
<i>Band of brothers! Band of brothers!</i>

01:19:26.762 --> 01:19:31.006
<i>At last the hearts that beat so strong</i>

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:35.552
<i>And bear their brothers' burden along</i>

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:39.980
<i>Across the bitter years they stand</i>

01:19:40.859 --> 01:19:45.774
<i>The future of the Fatherland!</i>

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:51.359
<i>Band of brothers! Band of brothers!</i>

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.535
To Captain Herold. Hip hip...

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.165
Hooray!

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:13.014
Now I'd like to say a word
about our esteemed Captain Herold,

01:20:13.100 --> 01:20:18.266
who took this whole thing into his hands
so speedily, decisively

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:20.562
and so terrifically.

01:20:21.775 --> 01:20:23.516
It went smoothly.

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.521
Smooth! Smooth! Smooth!

01:20:37.124 --> 01:20:39.536
Firstly, thanks for the kind words.

01:20:43.297 --> 01:20:48.087
But I have to note
that our work here is far from done.

01:20:48.177 --> 01:20:51.420
None of the inmates,
the parasites in this camp,

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:56.049
may fall into British hands alive
to then collaborate with the enemy.

01:21:03.192 --> 01:21:05.809
To our sacred duty and obedience.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:10.697
- To Task Force Herold!
- To Task Force Herold!

01:21:12.368 --> 01:21:13.779
Hey!

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:15.909
What is it?

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.065
Have a seat.

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.652
Come on. We won't bite.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.077
Come on. Sit down.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:03.741
Come on.

01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:07.916
Come now.

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.169
Here.

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.335
- Cheers.
- Thanks.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.421
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:22:32.156 --> 01:22:34.898
- What's your name?
- Roger, Captain.

01:22:34.992 --> 01:22:37.609
- Crime?
- Oh, you know, nothing really.

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:41.029
Nothing really?
So you're not a criminal at all?

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:44.908
No way! An actor is what I am.

01:22:45.002 --> 01:22:48.540
- And a clever one at that.
- Right. “Nothing really.”

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:52.168
- I'll get your file, you dog!
- No need for that.

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:54.842
I want to ask you something,
purely hypothetically.

01:22:57.848 --> 01:22:59.885
We'll pretend as if.

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:02.634
- We'll pretend you did something.
- But I didn't.

01:23:02.728 --> 01:23:05.265
Yes, I know. But you're an actor, right?

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:10.100
- Yes, but...
- Then act. Pretend you've done something.

01:23:10.194 --> 01:23:13.437
- Yes, act.
- That's exactly what hypnothecally means.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.657
"Hypno" what?

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:21.202
“Hypothetically” is what you mean.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:27.451
So what would someone like you do
if he had done something wrong?

01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.878
I've got a nose for these things.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:33.706
Judging by his looks, he's a thief.

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.507
What do you say, Gerda?

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.927
I don't know.

01:23:42.518 --> 01:23:45.135
- Maybe a murderer.
- A murderer?

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.186
I've never murdered anyone.

01:23:47.272 --> 01:23:50.014
- Not me!
- What are you then?

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:56.021
- Now think of something. It's just...
- Hypothetical.

01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:59.607
You're just pretending to be a criminal,
so to speak.

01:24:06.041 --> 01:24:07.998
Um, well, I'm not a murderer.

01:24:09.127 --> 01:24:11.038
If anything, then...

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:15.001
then probably more of a...

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.709
- Probably a thief.
- What did I say?

01:24:18.512 --> 01:24:21.049
- What did I say?
- What was it you stole?

01:24:23.392 --> 01:24:25.349
I haven't thought that far yet.

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:27.972
This is no fun. A bit more effort.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:31.639
- Maybe you stole food. That happens.
- If you're hungry.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.189
When it's a matter of survival.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:37.895
A few eggs here, a bit of bread there.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:41.365
A few lies. Small ones, big ones.

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.825
Whatever gets you through the dark times.

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:51.368
If you're not fucking death,
death will fuck you.

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:02.715
I, for example, stole this uniform.

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:22.614
I stole the wine.

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:26.197
I... I stole these potatoes here.

01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:28.746
That is, purely hypothetically.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:30.914
I can steal this sausage.

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:39.085
Captain, you're quite the actor.

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:40.758
Seriously now, what is it you did?

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:48.303
I stole from a dead comrade.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:52.728
- Oh, he's a grave robber!
- Now that's a hell of a confession.

01:25:53.982 --> 01:25:58.101
- No, I only mean hypothetically.
- Do you know what that means?

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:02.070
Should I tell you?

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.899
What? Should I tell you?

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:07.030
Should I spell it out for you?

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.703
Should I? Should I? Huh?

01:26:18.215 --> 01:26:20.331
What in the Sam hell is going on here?

01:26:45.158 --> 01:26:46.740
Come on! Come on!

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:01.047
- Come here, you swine!
- Hey, what is this crap?

01:27:01.133 --> 01:27:04.922
Didn't want to dig, huh? I'll show you!
Out, you swine!

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:35.990
That's enough! Back into the mess hall!

01:27:37.002 --> 01:27:39.994
What kind of a mess is this?

01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:41.578
You swine!

01:27:42.048 --> 01:27:44.380
Into the mess hall! And right now!

01:27:59.608 --> 01:28:02.191
Not like animals! Brockhoff!

01:28:10.202 --> 01:28:12.068
Captain, this is no good.

01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:14.870
This is not the proper way to do this.

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:17.072
This isn't German!

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.494
Enough!

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:31.512
Everyone listen up when “the Captain”
gives a command.

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:33.930
Everyone listen up!

01:28:34.017 --> 01:28:37.135
- “The Captain” is speaking!
- Enough, I said!

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:42.690
Everyone listen up
when "the Captain” gives a command.

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.812
Everyone listen up...

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:47.273
How does he dare speak like that?

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:51.449
Captain, I implore you.
Get things back in order immediately!

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:55.535
...listen up when “the Captain” speaks!

01:28:57.874 --> 01:29:00.832
This has to be done in an orderly manner!

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:52.636
Run.

01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.072
No!

01:30:23.668 --> 01:30:25.409
No cowardice.

01:32:16.698 --> 01:32:18.564
Next round's on me.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:27.906
Welcome to Task Force Herold.

01:33:13.338 --> 01:33:14.828
Captain!

01:33:20.136 --> 01:33:22.002
Captain!

01:33:23.973 --> 01:33:26.840
- I have to speak to the Captain.
- He is busy.

01:33:26.935 --> 01:33:30.178
- It's urgent!
- As I told you, the Captain is busy!

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:36.897
Then tell him the local reserve corps
are ready to start combing the area.

01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:41.984
- Pleased to report...
- I heard. Go to the mess hall, old friend.

01:33:54.921 --> 01:33:57.333
Deserters loot and rape,

01:33:57.382 --> 01:34:02.092
terrorize the civilian population,
threaten our brothers-in-arms.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:05.007
We must put an end to that!

01:34:06.141 --> 01:34:09.259
It's not enough
to wait for the scum to act.

01:34:09.352 --> 01:34:12.640
We have to preempt
the crimes of such riffraff!

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:17.850
They are antisocial, worthless elements
that Germany cannot tolerate.

01:34:19.279 --> 01:34:23.864
I expect a quick, efficient resolution.
No pussyfooting around.

01:34:52.937 --> 01:34:54.928
About the pants...

01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:59.307
They were too long.

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:02.019
But, thank God, now they fit, Captain.

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:20.003
Yes, that I am. The Captain.

01:36:07.553 --> 01:36:09.169
Captain!

01:36:09.264 --> 01:36:11.221
The reserves are back.

01:36:54.934 --> 01:36:56.140
British artillery!

01:38:02.710 --> 01:38:04.417
All right, let's go.

01:38:07.173 --> 01:38:08.663
Fall in.

01:38:10.385 --> 01:38:13.047
Task Force Herold, fall in!

01:38:37.286 --> 01:38:40.119
I wouldn't have given
a cent for our lives this time around.

01:38:43.167 --> 01:38:45.249
Isn't that right, old friend?

01:38:48.798 --> 01:38:50.755
Hell of a party, boss.

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.592
But this joint's closed for good.

01:39:15.992 --> 01:39:18.905
I promote you both
to the rank of corporal.

01:39:21.289 --> 01:39:23.155
You are now a sergeant.

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:29.786
Get yourselves uniforms.

01:39:32.633 --> 01:39:34.249
We're done here.

01:39:38.014 --> 01:39:42.884
A BRICK POST FROM THE CAMP GATE
IS ALL THAT REMAINS OF CAMP ll.

01:39:42.977 --> 01:39:46.095
THE REST IS A FIELD.

01:39:57.950 --> 01:40:00.282
EXPRESS COURT HEROLD

01:40:23.392 --> 01:40:24.928
Stop!

01:40:41.869 --> 01:40:43.951
Traitor to the Fatherland!

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.164
- Oh, shit!
- Requisition supplies.

01:40:54.590 --> 01:40:56.172
I am Captain Herold,

01:40:56.259 --> 01:40:59.797
head of Special Detachment
and Express Court Herold,

01:40:59.887 --> 01:41:02.720
the avenging angel
of our sacred German honor!

01:41:02.807 --> 01:41:06.300
And I will ensure every traitor
to the Fatherland gets just punishment.

01:41:07.770 --> 01:41:12.014
This sentence will please
all honor-loving Germans,

01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:18.066
and be a warning to all cowards who betray
their Fatherland in these hard times.

01:41:18.155 --> 01:41:21.398
I will return law and order to this place.

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.575
Freytag-

01:41:26.747 --> 01:41:28.454
Find the best house in town.

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.204
Get your passage fees ready.

01:41:34.422 --> 01:41:36.038
Bag.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:38.043
Empty it! Empty it!

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.318
Erika!

01:42:12.001 --> 01:42:14.663
- My girlfriend Irmgard.
- My pleasure.

01:42:14.754 --> 01:42:16.495
Pleasure's mine.

01:42:18.507 --> 01:42:20.623
This is Captain Herold.

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:24.882
Decorated for his bravery
by the Fuhrer himself.

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:28.139
Thank you.

01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:05.343
Hey! Hey!

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:06.885
Hey!

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:10.093
- Come on!
- Let go! Let go!

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:11.891
Let me go!

01:43:15.106 --> 01:43:17.222
- Let go!
- You dog!

01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:19.683
Let go! Let me go!

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:05.937
You are accused of looting, burglary and...

01:44:08.325 --> 01:44:10.532
high treason.

01:44:11.704 --> 01:44:14.116
Private Kipinski has disgraced our outfit.

01:44:14.206 --> 01:44:20.122
Express Court Herold finds him guilty
and sentences him to death by...

01:44:23.340 --> 01:44:25.172
firing squad.

01:44:34.226 --> 01:44:37.435
I flew inside you
like the devil into the virgin.

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:41.306
And that's where I'll stay.

01:44:42.902 --> 01:44:44.609
In your heart.

01:44:48.616 --> 01:44:50.072
Let's go.

01:45:49.635 --> 01:45:51.046
Aim.

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:56.638
Fire!

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:24.705
- <i>Crying?
- Laughing?</i>

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:27.127
<i>- Dreaming?
- Waking?</i>

01:46:27.214 --> 01:46:30.752
<i>Today I know not how far I'll go</i>

01:46:32.011 --> 01:46:36.721
<i>Where I walk, where I stand</i>

01:46:36.807 --> 01:46:40.266
<i>People they smile at me, it's true</i>

01:46:41.437 --> 01:46:45.897
<i>Today, my fairy tales will all come true</i>

01:46:45.983 --> 01:46:48.771
<i>Today, I see it all so clear</i>

01:46:48.861 --> 01:46:53.731
<i>- Come here, doggy!
- It' happens just once in a lifetime</i>

01:46:53.782 --> 01:46:57.741
<i>It'll never happen again
This is too good to be true</i>

01:46:57.828 --> 01:47:02.197
<i>Like a miracle shines down upon us</i>

01:47:02.291 --> 01:47:05.955
<i>From paradise, a golden ray</i>

01:47:06.420 --> 01:47:10.709
<i>It happens just once in a lifetime
It'll never happen again</i>

01:47:10.799 --> 01:47:16.385
<i>Perhaps it is merely a dream</i>

01:47:20.976 --> 01:47:25.561
<i>Such a miracle
comes only once and not twice</i>

01:47:25.648 --> 01:47:29.733
<i>Tomorrow it may be over</i>

01:47:29.818 --> 01:47:34.563
<i>Such a miracle
comes only once and not twice</i>

01:47:34.657 --> 01:47:38.241
<i>For every springtime has just one May</i>

01:49:14.965 --> 01:49:16.376
Get up!

01:49:16.508 --> 01:49:18.499
- Move! Come on.
- Hands up.

01:49:18.594 --> 01:49:20.301
Military Police!

01:49:40.741 --> 01:49:42.652
Military Police!

01:49:47.831 --> 01:49:49.037
Open the door!

01:50:02.137 --> 01:50:03.923
PRIVATE

01:50:05.057 --> 01:50:07.094
You're a private!

01:50:13.649 --> 01:50:16.107
So you confess to the following crimes:

01:50:17.069 --> 01:50:19.436
impersonating an officer,

01:50:20.197 --> 01:50:23.280
organizing the massacre in Camp ll,

01:50:23.367 --> 01:50:27.235
and, finally, hanging a mayor
who was flying a white flag.

01:50:27.996 --> 01:50:29.532
Shooting.

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:32.581
Shooting a mayor
who was flying a white flag.

01:50:33.293 --> 01:50:35.409
My father always said,

01:50:35.504 --> 01:50:38.246
“if you've done something wrong,
then at least admit it.”

01:50:41.218 --> 01:50:43.550
Sorry, but legally the case is clear.

01:50:43.637 --> 01:50:47.380
This man must inevitably be sentenced
to death by hanging.

01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.216
I don't know.

01:50:50.894 --> 01:50:52.805
That seems extreme to me.

01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:56.188
Given the chaotic times...

01:50:57.609 --> 01:50:59.725
Herold didn't behave that unreasonably.

01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:04.189
He displayed
a no-nonsense military demeanor,

01:51:04.283 --> 01:51:08.277
but, ultimately,
he did no harm to the Wehrmacht.

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:11.237
Herold always behaved
like an officer around me.

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:14.790
Herold has stood at attention
throughout this hearing.

01:51:14.877 --> 01:51:17.369
And it's been over four hours now.

01:51:18.630 --> 01:51:21.042
And he's done it without complaint!

01:51:22.009 --> 01:51:26.970
He's one spirited fellow. He showed
tremendous military leadership qualities.

01:51:27.055 --> 01:51:29.763
- Such men impress me.
- I'd like to add something.

01:51:30.726 --> 01:51:35.141
My actions were guided by my determination
to do everything in my power

01:51:35.230 --> 01:51:39.224
in these last days of the war
to curb the defeatist mentality

01:51:39.318 --> 01:51:41.810
and to keep Germany fighting.

01:51:43.197 --> 01:51:46.781
I've seen plenty of evil
committed out of necessity,

01:51:46.867 --> 01:51:49.575
but this man cannot possibly be
in his right mind.

01:51:49.620 --> 01:51:52.408
Well, you know, when I think back...

01:51:53.665 --> 01:51:57.784
to our days as young Freikorps soldiers.

01:51:57.878 --> 01:52:01.416
We used to get
pretty trigger-happy ourselves.

01:52:03.008 --> 01:52:05.124
Surely you don't mean to acquit him?

01:52:09.014 --> 01:52:10.596
Restricted release.

01:52:11.099 --> 01:52:13.761
I recommend suspending the case

01:52:13.852 --> 01:52:17.015
and giving him
an administrative transfer to the front.

01:52:17.105 --> 01:52:18.937
He's a peppy son of a gun.

01:52:18.982 --> 01:52:22.725
A man like him is worth
his weight in gold, especially now.

01:52:23.237 --> 01:52:25.319
Let's not kid ourselves.

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.066
The war is over.

01:52:28.033 --> 01:52:29.899
The Reich has lost.

01:52:30.410 --> 01:52:33.072
But that does not mean
that we're giving up.

01:52:33.622 --> 01:52:39.038
We will establish an underground army
that will operate in occupied Germany

01:52:39.127 --> 01:52:42.665
and continue the armed struggle
against the enemy.

01:52:42.756 --> 01:52:48.502
Heil Hitler! We'll march to Berlin on foot
to free the Reich's fallen capital!

01:52:48.595 --> 01:52:49.595
Yes, sir!

01:54:24.066 --> 01:54:26.398
ON MAY 23, 1945
THE ROYAL NAVY ARRESTED WILLI HEROLD

01:54:26.526 --> 01:54:28.267
FOR STEALING A LOAF OF BREAD.

01:54:28.362 --> 01:54:31.070
AT THE INTERROGATION HEROLD
BECAME ENTANGLED IN CONTRADICTIONS.

01:54:31.156 --> 01:54:34.524
HE WAS TRIED
AFTER HIS WAR CRIMES WERE DISCOVERED.

01:54:34.618 --> 01:54:42.618
ON NOVEMBER 14, 1946 HEROLD AND
SIX OF HIS ACCOMPLICES WERE EXECUTED.

01:54:43.418 --> 01:54:45.500
HE WAS 21.
