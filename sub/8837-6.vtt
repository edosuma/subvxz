PROBLEM WITH YOUR MA.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.918
- YOU DO?
- OF COURSE I DO.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.711
MAKING ME
SETTLE DOWN--

18:08.879 --> 18:10.296
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T
MIND AT FIRST,

18:10.464 --> 18:15.051
BUT A MAN GETS
ITCHY TO MOVE ON,
LIKE YOU'RE DOING.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.261
GET AWAY FROM TOWN,

18:17.429 --> 18:20.223
SEE THE WORLD.

18:20.390 --> 18:22.350
YOU KNOW
SOMETHING,
CHARLES?

18:22.518 --> 18:25.353
YOU AND ME--
WE'RE IN THE
SAME BOAT!

18:25.521 --> 18:26.479
WE ARE?

18:26.647 --> 18:28.064
YES, BOY, WE ARE,
AND, BY GOLLY,

18:28.232 --> 18:29.941
THERE'S NO
REASON FOR IT.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.526
A MAN OUGHT NOT
TO BE DOING THINGS

18:31.693 --> 18:33.236
THAT HE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE DOING.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.154
HE SHOULD DO
JUST WHAT HE
WANTS IN THIS LIFE

18:35.322 --> 18:37.990
AND THE HECK
WITH THE REST
OF THE WORLD.

18:38.158 --> 18:41.786
BY GOLLY, BOY,
YOU'VE MADE UP
MY MIND FOR ME.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.079
I'M GOING
WITH YOU!

18:43.247 --> 18:44.247
WHAT?

18:44.414 --> 18:45.873
LISTEN, IT WON'T TAKE
ME MORE THAN AN HOUR

18:46.041 --> 18:47.250
TO THROW A FEW THINGS
INTO A KNAPSACK.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.710
YOU WAIT FOR ME
RIGHT HERE.

18:49.878 --> 18:51.838
- PA!
- YEAH, BOY?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.006
ARE YOU SURE
YOU KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE DOING?

18:54.174 --> 18:56.300
WELL, I DO NOW,
THANKS TO YOU.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.094
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT MA?

18:58.262 --> 18:59.428
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT HER?

18:59.596 --> 19:01.639
WELL, SHE LOVES YOU,

19:01.807 --> 19:03.724
AND SHE'LL MISS YOU
SOMETHING FIERCE.

19:03.892 --> 19:04.976
WELL, SHE
LOVES YOU,
TOO,

19:05.144 --> 19:06.686
BUT YOU'RE
NOT LETTING
THAT STOP YOU,

19:06.854 --> 19:07.895
SO NEITHER AM I.

19:08.063 --> 19:10.940
WELL, WHAT
ABOUT PETER

19:11.108 --> 19:13.651
AND LYDIA
AND POLLY?

19:13.819 --> 19:16.612
WELL, YOU JUST SAID
THAT PETER'S ALWAYS
ACTING LIKE ME.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.156
HE CAN TAKE CARE
OF YOUR SISTERS.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.449
HE'S NOT
LIKE YOU.

19:20.617 --> 19:22.285
HE AIN'T
NOTHING
LIKE YOU.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.661
YOU JUST
SAID HE WAS!

19:23.829 --> 19:27.748
OH, YOU SHOULDN'T
PAY NO MIND
TO WHAT I SAY.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.375
I'M JUST LITTLE.

19:29.543 --> 19:33.421
WELL, YOU'RE BIG
ENOUGH TO BE RUNNING
OFF, AREN'T YOU?

19:33.589 --> 19:35.590
AREN'T YOU?

19:35.757 --> 19:39.552
I WASN'T GOING
TO RUN OFF, PA...

19:39.720 --> 19:42.638
NOT REALLY.

19:42.806 --> 19:45.850
THINGS AREN'T
SO BAD,

19:46.018 --> 19:49.729
AND THERE'S STILL ROOM
IN THE BIG WOODS,

19:49.897 --> 19:54.901
AND MA DOESN'T MEAN
IT WHEN SHE'S BOSSY
SOMETIMES.

19:55.068 --> 19:59.155
Charles: IT'S
MOSTLY BECAUSE
SHE LOVES YOU.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.656
YOU THINK SO?

20:00.824 --> 20:02.408
I KNOW IT.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.410
Lansford: AND
YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO RUN OFF?

20:04.578 --> 20:07.205
SURE, I'M SURE.

20:07.372 --> 20:12.168
WELL...IF YOU'RE
MAN ENOUGH TO STAY,

20:12.336 --> 20:13.753
I WILL, TOO.

20:16.173 --> 20:19.467
BY GOLLY, ALL THIS
TALKING'S GIVEN
ME AN APPETITE.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.219
WHAT SAY WE GO HOME?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.845
I WOULDN'T BE
SURPRISED IF
YOUR MA'S GOT

20:23.013 --> 20:25.473
A FRESH PIE
IN THE OVEN.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.099
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.602
HOME SOUNDS GOOD.

20:50.707 --> 20:52.208
Ticket Inspector:
TICKETS, PLEASE.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.963
GOING A LONG WAY.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.464
YEAH.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.549
I'M GOING HOME.

21:04.513 --> 21:05.554
GOING HOME.

21:05.722 --> 21:09.558
[TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWING]

21:37.713 --> 21:39.088
ELIZA!

21:41.675 --> 21:43.009
CHARLES?

21:44.928 --> 21:47.763
ELIZA ANN!

21:47.931 --> 21:49.348
CHARLES!

21:53.854 --> 21:56.397
OH, DARLING,
LET ME LOOK
AT YOU.

21:56.565 --> 21:58.816
THE PRETTIEST GAL
AROUND EXCEPT FOR
YOUR SISTER.

21:58.984 --> 21:59.942
HOW IS CAROLINE?

22:00.110 --> 22:02.194
OH, SHE'S FINE.
SHE SENDS HER LOVE.

22:02.362 --> 22:03.571
WHAT AM I DOING,
HAVING YOU STAND
OUT HERE?

22:03.739 --> 22:04.613
COME ON INSIDE.

22:04.781 --> 22:06.073
I'LL START US
A GOOD SUPPER.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.868
ALL RIGHT. SOUNDS
GOOD. I HAVEN'T
SEEN PAPA YET.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.120
I'LL GO SEE HIM
AFTER SUPPER.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.455
HOW'S THAT
BROTHER OF MINE?

22:12.622 --> 22:14.498
OH, JUST AS
ORNERY AS THE DAY
I MARRIED HIM.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.334
HOW'S PAPA
FEELING?

22:16.501 --> 22:18.294
NOT TOO WELL,
I'M AFRAID.

22:18.462 --> 22:19.795
PETER SEEING
A LOT OF HIM?

22:19.963 --> 22:23.299
NO. THINGS
AREN'T TOO GOOD
BETWEEN THEM.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.884
WHY? WHAT'S
THE MATTER?

22:25.052 --> 22:27.970
I'D BEST LET
PETER TELL YOU
WHEN HE GETS HOME.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.769
Peter: YOU FINISHED WITH
YOUR SUPPER, AMELIA?

22:34.936 --> 22:36.145
YES, SIR.

22:36.313 --> 22:37.355
Peter: YOU MAY BE EXCUSED.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.565
CAN I WAIT UNTIL
JAMES IS THROUGH?

22:39.733 --> 22:41.484
Peter: HE'S
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.694
YOU'RE BOTH EXCUSED.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.365
Amelia: NICE TO SEE YOU
AGAIN, UNCLE CHARLES.

22:47.532 --> 22:49.283
IT'S NICE TO SEE
YOU AGAIN, AMELIA.

22:51.995 --> 22:53.120
CLOSE THE DOOR.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.663
Amelia:
YES, SIR.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.839
A FINE SUPPER,
ELIZA.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.049
THANK YOU.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.217
THERE'S
A BIT MORE.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.844
NO, NO. I'VE HAD
MY FILL, THANK YOU.

23:09.012 --> 23:13.849
WELL, I EXPECT
WE BETTER TALK
ABOUT PA NOW.

23:14.017 --> 23:15.684
I APPRECIATE YOUR
NOT SAYING ANYTHING

23:15.852 --> 23:18.437
UNTIL THE CHILDREN
WERE THROUGH.

23:18.605 --> 23:21.232
I DON'T LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT IT
IN FRONT OF THEM.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.860
GO ON.

23:26.530 --> 23:32.493
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HIM FOR
WHAT--4 YEARS?

23:32.661 --> 23:34.912
WELL, IT'S
ALMOST 5, YEAH.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.291
WELL, IF YOU THOUGHT
HE WAS BAD WHEN HE
LOST THE FARM,

23:39.459 --> 23:42.044
WAIT TILL YOU
SEE HIM NOW.

23:42.212 --> 23:44.255
HE JUST...

23:44.423 --> 23:47.925
DON'T DO NOTHING BUT
TALK ABOUT FAILING

23:48.093 --> 23:50.052
AND DYING--

23:50.220 --> 23:52.263
Peter:
MOSTLY DYING.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.558
WELL, IT'S ONLY BEEN
A MONTH SINCE MA DIED.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.643
IT TAKES A LITTLE TIME.

23:57.811 --> 24:01.230
I'M NOT SO SURE
IT'S GOOD FOR HIM
TO BE ALONE SO MUCH.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.858
IT'S WHAT HE WANTS.
IT'S HIS CHOICE.

24:05.402 --> 24:07.236
WELL, MAYBE WE
SHOULDN'T LET HIM
MAKE THAT DECISION.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.488
BUT WHAT IN
GOD'S NAME DO YOU
EXPECT ME TO DO?

24:09.656 --> 24:11.824
- PETER.
- NO!

24:11.992 --> 24:13.742
WHO DOES HE THINK HE
IS, COMING BACK HERE

24:13.910 --> 24:15.578
AND ACCUSING
ME OF...

24:15.745 --> 24:17.621
OF NOT TREATING
PA RIGHT?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.081
IT'S WELL AND
GOOD FOR HIM,

24:19.249 --> 24:20.624
LIVING HALFWAY
ACROSS THE WORLD
AWAY FROM ALL THIS!

24:20.792 --> 24:22.293
PETER, I'M NOT
ACCUSING YOU
OF ANYTHING.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.211
I'M JUST TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S BEST FOR PA.

24:24.379 --> 24:27.965
AND I'M TRYING TO
FIGURE OUT WHAT'S BEST
FOR ME AND MY FAMILY!

24:28.133 --> 24:29.758
I'M NOT GOING
TO HAVE HIM
AROUND HERE,

24:29.926 --> 24:31.635
WITH HIS TALKING
ABOUT FAILING,

24:31.803 --> 24:33.596
ABOUT BEING
USELESS.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.097
HE DID THAT TO
MA FOR YEARS,

24:35.265 --> 24:37.683
UP UNTIL THE DAY
SHE DIED!

24:37.851 --> 24:39.685
WELL, HE'S
NOT GOING TO
DO IT TO ME,

24:39.853 --> 24:41.812
OR TO MY FAMILY.

24:47.527 --> 24:51.405
WELL, I THINK
I'D BETTER GET ON
OVER AND SEE PA.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.408
I'LL STOP BY
AND SAY GOOD-BYE
ON MY WAY HOME.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.582
Peter: DON'T
GO AND SEE HIM,
LITTLE BROTHER.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.959
IT WON'T DO
NO GOOD.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.003
JUST GO ON HOME,

25:06.171 --> 25:08.964
REMEMBER HIM THE
WAY HE WAS WHEN
WE WERE LITTLE.

25:12.302 --> 25:14.762
THAT'S ALL I
DO, REMEMBER
HIM, PETER.

25:17.140 --> 25:18.974
AND SO I'VE GOT
TO GO SEE HIM.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.680
PAPA?

26:02.435 --> 26:05.854
CHARLES?
IS THAT YOU, BOY?

26:06.022 --> 26:08.524
YES, SIR.

26:08.692 --> 26:11.527
WHERE IN HEAVEN'S NAME
HAVE YOU BEEN, BOY?

26:11.695 --> 26:15.364
YOUR MA'S HAD
SUPPER ON THE
TABLE FOR AN HOUR!

26:15.532 --> 26:17.408
I CAME HOME AS
SOON AS I COULD.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.326
WELL, THAT'S
NO ANSWER.

26:19.494 --> 26:21.954
WHERE WERE YOU?
SPEAK UP.

26:22.122 --> 26:25.958
I WAS DOING
SOME PLOWING
FOR MR. HOLBROOK.

26:29.546 --> 26:30.921
I'LL NOT HAVE IT!

26:31.089 --> 26:33.507
PAPA, WE NEED THE MONEY!

26:33.675 --> 26:34.883
THE LOAN'S COME DUE!

26:35.051 --> 26:37.303
AS LONG AS YOU
LIVE IN MY HOUSE

26:37.470 --> 26:40.055
AND UNDER MY ROOF,
YOU'LL DO AS I SAY!

26:40.223 --> 26:43.142
AND I SAY THAT YOU'LL
NOT WORK FOR HOLBROOK

26:43.310 --> 26:45.227
OR FOR ANYONE ELSE!

26:47.355 --> 26:50.065
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS FAMILY.

26:50.233 --> 26:51.984
YOU AND YOUR MA THINK
THAT I CAN'T DO IT.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.944
WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU.

26:54.112 --> 26:56.488
HAD A BAD RUN OF
LUCK, THAT'S ALL.

26:56.656 --> 26:58.907
BUT THAT'LL CHANGE.
IT'S BOUND TO CHANGE.

26:59.075 --> 27:03.120
AND WHEN IT DOES,
OH, WE'LL BE LIVING
IN A FINE HOUSE,

27:03.288 --> 27:07.541
AND YOUR MA
WILL BE DANCING IN
STORE-BOUGHT SHOES.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.460
YOU HEAR ME, BOY?

27:16.009 --> 27:17.509
PAPA.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.221
I CAME AS
SOON AS I COULD.

27:32.442 --> 27:33.942
MY SON...

28:21.950 --> 28:24.076
[VIOLIN PLAYING]

28:47.809 --> 28:49.017
OH, LAND SAKES.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.310
WHEN I HEAR
MUSIC LIKE THAT,

28:50.478 --> 28:52.187
MY FEET WANT TO DANCE.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.189
THEN GO AHEAD.

28:54.357 --> 28:55.441
WHAT'LL IT BE?

28:55.608 --> 28:56.734
DON'T YOU DARE.

28:56.901 --> 28:58.736
I'LL END UP BY
DUNKING BOTH OF US.

28:58.903 --> 29:03.031
OH, YOU'RE
THE BEST DANCER IN
ALL OF WISCONSIN.

29:03.199 --> 29:04.992
WELL, I WAS...

29:05.160 --> 29:06.869
I GUESS.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.538
CAN'T DANCE LIKE
THAT ANYMORE, THOUGH.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.081
GUESS I'M GETTING OLD.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.208
OH, YOU'LL NEVER
GET OLD.

29:13.376 --> 29:15.502
YOU'RE JUST
OUT OF PRACTICE
IS ALL.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.674
WELL, WE HAVEN'T DANCED
IN A WHILE, HAVE WE?

29:20.842 --> 29:23.552
Charles:
NO, MA'AM.

29:23.720 --> 29:27.723
YOUR PA HAD GREAT
PLANS FOR US, CHARLES.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.559
HE WANTED TO
DO GOOD THINGS
FOR ALL OF US.

29:30.727 --> 29:32.811
WE DON'T NEED
SO MUCH.

29:32.979 --> 29:35.314
WE CAN ALWAYS
MAKE DO.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.107
OF COURSE WE CAN.

29:37.275 --> 29:41.320
THEN WHY DOESN'T HE
EVER SMILE ANYMORE?

29:41.488 --> 29:44.531
BECAUSE HE FEELS
HE LET US DOWN.

29:44.699 --> 29:48.410
BECAUSE HIS GREAT
DREAM DIDN'T COME TRUE.

29:48.578 --> 29:51.413
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT
WE LOST THE FARM.

29:51.581 --> 29:54.708
TWO CROPS LOST ON
ACCOUNT OF WEATHER.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.127
A MAN CAN'T TAKE
BLAME ON WEATHER.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.879
WELL, HE SHOULDN'T,

29:59.047 --> 30:01.089
BUT HE DOES!

30:01.257 --> 30:03.675
THAT'S THE TROUBLE
WITH DREAMS.

30:03.843 --> 30:06.512
THEY ONLY WORK OUT IF
THINGS GO JUST RIGHT.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.182
I WISH PA NEVER
HAD THOSE DREAMS.

30:10.350 --> 30:13.435
WISH WE'D JUST
STAYED IN ONE
PLACE AND MADE DO.

30:13.603 --> 30:17.856
OH, YOU SAY THAT NOW,
BUT JUST YOU WAIT.

30:18.024 --> 30:20.442
THERE'S A LOT OF YOUR
PA IN YOU, CHARLES.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.611
Mrs. Colby: IT WASN'T
YOUR PA'S DREAMS
THAT WERE WRONG.

30:22.779 --> 30:24.279
IT WAS JUST THAT
HE COUNTED TOO
MUCH ON THEM.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.949
THAT'S WHAT
WAS WRONG.

30:27.116 --> 30:29.493
YOUR OLDER
BROTHER'S
MORE LIKE ME.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.495
HE'S GOING TO
SETTLE IN ONE PLACE

30:31.663 --> 30:34.540
AND STAY PUT,

30:34.707 --> 30:35.791
MAKE DO.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.292
SO WILL I.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.003
I WANT TO BE LIKE
YOU AND PETER.

30:40.171 --> 30:43.966
THE GOOD LORD MIGHT
NOT WANT YOU TO BE.

30:44.133 --> 30:47.344
BUT DON'T YOU BE
AFRAID TO DREAM, SON.

30:47.512 --> 30:49.596
Mrs. Colby:
AND MORE IMPORTANT,

30:49.764 --> 30:52.266
DON'T YOU BE
AFRAID TO FAIL.

30:52.433 --> 30:55.102
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT
AFRAID AND YOU FAIL,

30:55.270 --> 30:57.729
WELL, IT DOESN'T
MAKE YOU WEAKER.

30:57.897 --> 30:59.690
IT JUST MAKES
YOU STRONGER.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.447
WISH ON A
WILDFLOWER...

31:07.615 --> 31:08.991
WHAT?

31:09.158 --> 31:11.118
I HAD A DREAM ONCE.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.621
ALL I HAD TO DO WAS
WISH ON A WILDFLOWER,
AND IT CAME TRUE.

31:14.789 --> 31:19.334
OH, CHARLES INGALLS,
YOU AND YOUR WISHES
AND YOUR DREAMS.

31:19.502 --> 31:22.004
YOU JUST SAID
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO DREAM.

31:23.298 --> 31:26.383
SEEMS TO ME I
DID SAY SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.687
THERE.

31:39.856 --> 31:42.274
GUESS WE'D
BETTER GO
HOME NOW.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.503
[THUNDER]

32:44.671 --> 32:46.838
GOT A GOOD
STORM GOING.

32:47.006 --> 32:49.216
MA ALWAYS DID
LIKE A GOOD STORM.

32:49.384 --> 32:53.512
REMEMBER? SHE SAID
IT WAS GOD'S WAY OF
SHOWING US HIS POWER.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.848
CHURCH ATTENDANCE
ALWAYS DID SEEM TO BE
UP AFTER A GOOD ONE.

33:00.603 --> 33:02.270
YOU KNOW, I
WAS TELLING YOU
ABOUT MY CROP.

33:02.438 --> 33:03.563
WELL, IT'S GOING
TO BE A DANDY.

33:03.731 --> 33:05.732
I WISH YOU
COULD SEE IT.

33:05.900 --> 33:07.109
GOING TO ADD ANOTHER
ROOM ON THE PLACE.

33:07.276 --> 33:08.527
I'VE BEEN WANTING TO
DO IT FOR A LONG TIME.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.029
AND NOW
WITH THIS CROP,
WE'LL BE ABLE TO.

33:11.197 --> 33:12.322
TAKE A LITTLE WHILE
TO GET IT FIXED,

33:12.490 --> 33:14.992
BUT WE COULD
MAKE A LITTLE
PLACE FOR YOU

33:15.159 --> 33:17.577
IN THE SODDY
TILL IT WAS READY.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.497
CAROLINE AND THE
GIRLS SURE ARE LOOKING
FORWARD TO SEEING YOU.

33:22.458 --> 33:23.709
NOT A BAD TRIP
NOW, EITHER.

33:23.876 --> 33:25.460
THINGS ARE A LOT
DIFFERENT NOW
WITH THE TRAINS.

33:25.628 --> 33:28.255
JUST EASY RIDE
ALL THE WAY.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.799
I CAN'T LEAVE
YOUR MA.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.935
[THUNDER]

33:46.149 --> 33:48.442
SHE'S GONE NOW, PA.
THERE'S NOTHING
FOR YOU HERE.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.570
SHE'S HERE.
I CAN'T LEAVE HER.

33:51.738 --> 33:54.156
IF SHE WERE HERE,
SHE'D TELL YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

33:54.323 --> 33:57.409
GO BACK TO
YOUR FAMILY
AND LEAVE ME BE.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.161
I CAN'T DO THAT.
YOU'RE MY FATHER.

33:59.328 --> 34:00.412
YOU'RE PART
OF MY FAMILY.

34:00.580 --> 34:04.708
GO HOME, AND LET
ME DIE IN PEACE.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.877
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
START TALKING
ABOUT DYING.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.128
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

34:08.296 --> 34:09.838
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
WHAT YOU WANT.

34:10.006 --> 34:11.465
WHENEVER THINGS
DIDN'T TURN
OUT JUST RIGHT,

34:11.632 --> 34:15.302
YOU SAW TO IT
EVERYBODY WAS JUST AS
MISERABLE AS YOU WERE.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.179
[THUNDER]

34:17.346 --> 34:19.181
YOU WATCH HOW YOU
TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

34:19.348 --> 34:21.475
WHY, PA?
AM I TELLING A LIE?

34:21.642 --> 34:23.435
YOU KNOW, YOU TOLD ME
ONCE A MAN COULD SAY
ANYTHING HE WANTED

34:23.603 --> 34:24.686
AS LONG AS HE WAS
SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

34:24.854 --> 34:26.605
WELL, THAT'S WHAT
I'M DOING NOW.

34:26.773 --> 34:28.148
YOU'RE STAYING
HERE, MOURNING,

34:28.316 --> 34:30.317
TALKING ABOUT DYING.
- I WANT TO BE WITH HER!

34:30.485 --> 34:32.235
YOU'RE
WITH HER NOW!

34:32.403 --> 34:34.154
IF YOU JUST HAD
THAT FAITH YOU WERE
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT,

34:34.322 --> 34:36.573
YOU'D KNOW THAT.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.241
GOD FORGIVE YOU
FOR SAYING THAT.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.661
OH, NO. NO, PA, GOD
FORGIVE YOU FOR WASTING
THE LIFE HE GAVE YOU

34:41.829 --> 34:45.665
FEELING SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

34:45.833 --> 34:47.751
[THUNDER]

34:51.464 --> 34:56.093
YOU KNOW, ALL MA
EVER CARED ABOUT
WAS YOU BEING HAPPY.

34:56.260 --> 34:59.554
I PRAY TO
GOD SHE CAN'T
SEE YOU NOW.

34:59.722 --> 35:17.656
[THUNDER]

35:37.552 --> 35:39.219
MAMA...

35:43.307 --> 35:45.433
I'M SORRY, MAMA.

35:47.436 --> 35:50.021
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT HIM.

35:53.109 --> 35:56.278
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

35:56.445 --> 35:57.779
[THUNDER]

35:57.947 --> 35:59.948
I LOVE HIM,

LET ME DIE?

37:38.881 --> 37:40.173
WHY?

37:42.009 --> 37:44.177
NOT THIS WAY, PAPA...

37:46.555 --> 37:48.014
NOT THIS WAY.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.394
Charles: YOU'VE
DONE ENOUGH TO
MAMA ALREADY.

37:55.022 --> 37:58.024
PA, WE'RE GOING HOME.

38:02.363 --> 38:04.114
WE'RE GOING HOME.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.312

38:39.692 --> 38:41.735
I GOT US A RIDE
WITH MR. HILYARD.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.946
OH. THAT'S
NEIGHBORLY
OF HIM.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.944
WE'RE GOING NOW, MA.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.156
I WISH THINGS
WERE DIFFERENT.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.658
I WISH YOU WERE
GOING WITH US.

39:30.826 --> 39:34.412
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WANTED
TO SEE THOSE GRANDKIDS
OF YOURS AGAIN.

39:36.499 --> 39:39.667
YOU'D BE PROUD
OF THEM, TOO, MA.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.503
YOU'D REALLY BE PROUD.

39:46.258 --> 39:50.387
PA DOESN'T WANT TO GO,
YOU KNOW. HE...

39:50.554 --> 39:53.765
JUST WANTS
TO STAY HERE AND DIE.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.605
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GOING TO DO ABOUT
IT, BUT I'M GOING TO TRY.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.819
I PROMISE YOU THAT
I'M GOING TO TRY.

40:10.032 --> 40:13.118
SO JUST BE HAPPY, MA...

40:13.285 --> 40:16.162

ABOUT ANYTHING.

EVERYTHING YOU COULD,

40:20.292 --> 40:22.460

41:58.057 --> 42:00.141
CARRIE, TURKEYS
DON'T GO FOR WALKS.

42:00.309 --> 42:02.560
THEN WHY DO
THEY HAVE LEGS?

42:02.728 --> 42:04.938
SO PEOPLE CAN
EAT DRUMSTICKS.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.898
YOU CAN'T EAT
TOM'S LEGS.

HE'S MY OWN TURKEY.
PA SAID SO.

42:10.027 --> 42:12.654
WELL, WHY DO YOU
THINK PA GAVE HIM
TO YOU TO RAISE?

42:12.821 --> 42:16.658
SO HE COULD EAT SUPPER

CARRIE THOUGHT HE
MEANT WE WERE GOING TO
HAVE HIM FOR SUPPER,

44:28.207 --> 44:30.249
SHE REMINDS ME
SO MUCH OF MAMA.

WHEN SHE WENT
TO DANCING,

44:31.710 --> 44:33.670
THERE WASN'T
A PARTNER

I REMEMBER.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.924
AH, LAURA.

44:38.092 --> 44:40.635
YOU CERTAINLY PICKED
THE RIGHT NAME

DIDN'T I?

44:42.971 --> 44:44.806
YOU INSISTED ON IT.

YOU SAID ANY BABE

ADMIT I WAS RIGHT!

44:52.314 --> 44:54.816
YOU WERE RIGHT.
