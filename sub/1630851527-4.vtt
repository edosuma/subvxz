WEBVTT

00:45.640 --> 00:46.680
Oh.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.960
I say, this is...

00:49.960 --> 00:52.440
Thought you'd like it.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.200
Like it?

00:54.200 --> 00:56.240
It's magnificent.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.760
This means a lot, Siegfried.
Thank you.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.240
Not at all.
Not at all.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.000
Happy birthday.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.480
Yes, Happy birthday, Triss.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.920
Right, more tea.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.440
Oh, I've...

01:11.440 --> 01:12.840
..one more present for you.

01:16.480 --> 01:18.640
You're giving me my own list?

01:18.640 --> 01:21.640
I have decided it's time to let you
stand on your own two feet.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.240
Oh.

01:23.240 --> 01:24.480
Right.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.600
So I'll be going out on my own?

01:27.600 --> 01:30.280
Well, to all intents and purposes.
I thought James could come along,

01:30.280 --> 01:33.080
just in case.
But it'll be your show.

01:33.080 --> 01:35.520
That is if you
think you can handle it?

01:35.520 --> 01:37.720
Oh, yes, yes, absolutely.
Excellent.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.320
Hang on does that say
"Sebright Saunders"?

01:47.320 --> 01:48.680
Are you sending me to the estate?

01:48.680 --> 01:50.080
Uh-huh.

01:50.080 --> 01:52.720
They've a number of horses need
tooth filing.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.320
They're valuable animals too,

01:54.320 --> 01:56.520
so make sure you've
got your wits about you.

01:56.520 --> 01:58.160
Of course.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.240
That bag won't be much
use to you empty.

02:04.640 --> 02:06.280
Right.

02:06.280 --> 02:08.120
Make sure you take a decent rasp.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.640
Will do.
And a spare.

02:10.640 --> 02:12.120
Tristan?

02:12.120 --> 02:14.280
Did you hear me?

02:17.280 --> 02:20.960
Tristan?!

02:24.720 --> 02:26.560
Good evening with Helen, were it?

02:26.560 --> 02:28.240
It was, thanks.

02:29.840 --> 02:32.080
She's a smashing lass.

02:39.120 --> 02:41.840
Have you had the chance to talk
over Glasgow with her?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.400
Not yet.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.440
I know.
I'll do it today.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.040
Candy's in foal so I said I'd go up
and take a look.

02:50.040 --> 02:51.760
I'll tell her about the job, then.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.640
Jacket.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.320
Are you sure you've got tweezers?
Yes.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.760
Both sizes?
Yes, and yes.

03:03.760 --> 03:05.320
I actually do know what I'm doing.

03:05.320 --> 03:07.520
Stop your fussing.
You'll make him nervous.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.400
Here...

03:14.720 --> 03:16.200
Very smart.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.080
Every inch the professional.

03:18.080 --> 03:20.280
Yes, well, come on,
don't be keeping them waiting.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.480
So will Mrs Brompton be joining us
at the Drovers for birthday drinks?

03:23.480 --> 03:25.440
I think she's planning to
drop in briefly.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.040
Hope you told her to come
before things get too rowdy.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.560
Oh, it's just a few drinks.

03:29.560 --> 03:32.400
Please try not to get
completely legless.

03:32.400 --> 03:36.000
I can assure you, I'm planning a
very civilised evening. Oh, yes?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.200
It's not like I'm a student any
more.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.600
Things have changed.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.120
In fact, I was half wondering

03:41.120 --> 03:44.160
if a little dinner might be
more appropriate.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.440
Oh, aye? I mean, it wouldn't have to
be anything fancy,

03:46.440 --> 03:48.400
but if it's too much trouble.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.880
Birthday dinner for six at less
than a day's notice?

03:50.880 --> 03:52.800
No, no, you're right, it's a
stupid idea...

03:52.800 --> 03:54.240
I'm sure I can rustle something up.

03:54.240 --> 03:56.600
Oh, Mrs H, you're an absolute star.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.560
That's one word for it.

03:58.560 --> 04:00.760
And actually, if you could make it
dinner for seven...

04:00.760 --> 04:02.000
Oh, for the love of God...

04:02.000 --> 04:04.040
I just thought I might want to
invite a guest.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.800
And who exactly might you
want to invite?

04:06.800 --> 04:09.400
I don't know yet,
but the day is still young.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.760
Good luck, Tristan.

04:29.760 --> 04:32.600
He doesn't need luck.
He just needs to concentrate.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.280
ENGINE WHINES

04:37.120 --> 04:38.920
ENGINE GRINDS

04:41.320 --> 04:43.200
Right, cheerio.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.640
He'll be fine.
'Course he will.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.160
Right, so, when we get to the
estate, I'll just introduce myself

05:07.160 --> 05:09.560
and explain that I'll be dealing
with the horses today.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.760
I'm fairly sure they'll know
who you are, Triss.

05:11.760 --> 05:13.680
You've been coming out to the
farms half your life.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.880
Yes, as Siegfried's little brother,
maybe.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.360
But now I'm here as a vet.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.200
It's a whole different
kettle of fish.

05:19.200 --> 05:21.800
You're going to do fine.
You know what he's doing, don't you?

05:21.800 --> 05:24.240
He's basically setting me
up to fail.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.920
I don't think that's true.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.080
He's giving me this big new chance.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.440
But he's just waiting for me
to mess it up.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.760
Where's Farnon?
Right here.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.360
You what?

06:13.360 --> 06:14.840
Tristan Farnon, Mr Monkham.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.160
Siegfried's brother.
And fully qualified vet.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.360
I'll be taking care of the tooth
rasping today.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.040
Mr Farnon always sees to the
horses himself.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.960
Well, he's asked me
to deputise on this occasion.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.480
Aye.
What you gonna be doing?

06:27.480 --> 06:28.960
I'm just here to observe.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.520
Right, well,
I can't say as I like it.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.760
But I haven't got all day.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.080
So, let's see what you've got.

06:36.640 --> 06:38.840
This way. Right...

06:42.480 --> 06:44.760
You wanted this?
Please.

06:44.760 --> 06:48.680
Poor Bonnie here had quite
a sizeable lipoma on her ribcage.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.480
Oh. Benign, but, still,
an ugly great mass.

06:51.480 --> 06:55.280
Luckily, I was able to remove it
with remarkable ease.

06:55.280 --> 06:59.240
Let's just, erm, lay her down on
that blanket, while she comes round.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.080
Might take an hour or so.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.800
That's the ticket.

07:06.800 --> 07:09.000
There we are.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.960
Yes.
Very nice, though I say so myself,
it should hardly leave a scar.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.600
DOG YELPS

07:17.600 --> 07:19.320
Should she be doing that?

07:19.320 --> 07:20.840
Oh, it's nothing to worry about,

07:20.840 --> 07:23.240
happens to some animals after
an anaesthetic.

07:23.240 --> 07:26.200
It's just the barbiturates
leaving the system.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.080
Well, I'm off to the butcher's.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.120
If I can get a decent enough joint,

07:31.120 --> 07:33.400
I might try my hand
at a beef Wellington.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.120
Goodness,
that's rather elaborate.

07:35.120 --> 07:37.160
Well, I don't want your young
ladies thinking

07:37.160 --> 07:39.040
we don't know how to entertain.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.320
I assume Mrs Brompton's still
joining us?

07:41.320 --> 07:44.600
Yes, yes, she was delighted with the
invitation.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.600
Well, in't that nice.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.800
Right, well, as I'm done, I think
I'll head out too.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.960
And see how Triss is getting on.

07:53.960 --> 07:57.120
You said he needs to
stand on his own two feet.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.480
So let him.

08:05.840 --> 08:07.280
Just don't let him rattle you.

08:07.280 --> 08:08.520
Absolutely.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.000
Just focus on the job in hand.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.960
HORSES NEIGH LOUDLY

08:19.120 --> 08:21.040
Who's that?

08:21.040 --> 08:24.320
Oh, yes.
Miss Margot Sebright Saunders.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.320
Might she be a suitable candidate?

08:26.320 --> 08:28.160
Rather out of my league, I fear.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.800
Margot's generally
squired by minor gentry.

08:30.800 --> 08:32.520
You're a man of means now.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.040
A respectable professional.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.240
She might see you in a whole
new light.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.160
See?

08:45.160 --> 08:47.360
You don't want to miss
out for a lack of confidence.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.400
Ah, you may have a point.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.800
Nothing ventured.

08:49.800 --> 08:52.680
It certainly worked for you
and Helen.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.840
Well, it's early days.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.040
I still have time to mess it up.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.720
Are you two coming?

09:10.840 --> 09:12.720
Excellent.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.240
There's another two need
doing, across the yard.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.040
Right, let's take a look, shall we?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.880
Hope he's not a kicker.

09:21.880 --> 09:24.280
Right, here we go, good lad.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.040
Ah yes, I can see there's quite
a sharp point just here.

09:29.040 --> 09:32.200
Should be able to file
that off nicely.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.240
If you could just hold him steady?

09:37.240 --> 09:39.240
Monkham? Yes, Miss Margot.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.440
I want to ride out to
Sennor Woods this afternoon.

09:41.440 --> 09:44.440
Will you see that my horse is ready?
Yes, Miss. Gosh.

09:44.440 --> 09:47.080
Are you an actual vet now, Tristan?
That's right.

09:47.080 --> 09:50.640
Tristan Sebastian Farnon, MRCVS,
at your service.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.120
Well, well done you.
Yes, I've got all the credentials.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.040
And the qualifications and the...

09:56.800 --> 09:58.200
Wonderful.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.800
I'm just going up to the house, but
I'll be back for him after lunch.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.200
Yes, Miss.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.280
Aye, I'll let you get on, then.

10:06.280 --> 10:09.080
Jolly good.
You're doing grand.

10:09.080 --> 10:11.720
HORSE NEIGHS LOUDLY
Easy, boy.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.160
Good Lord,
what's going on out there?

10:15.160 --> 10:16.880
That'll be Satan.

10:16.880 --> 10:19.360
Oh, yes?
Aye.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.760
He's another that needs raspin'.

10:30.720 --> 10:32.880
DOG WHIMPERS

10:35.000 --> 10:37.880
"Oh, what can ail thee,
dog-at-arms,

10:37.880 --> 10:39.880
"Alone and palely loitering?"

10:39.880 --> 10:42.600
There's nothing
physical that I can see.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.440
Just don't like being by yourself,
is that it?

10:44.440 --> 10:46.000
Perhaps you could play with Jess.

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
Are you sure she's not
sickening for something?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.200
Not in the least,
she's perfectly healthy.

10:50.200 --> 10:52.440
Probably just wants
a bit of company.

10:52.440 --> 10:53.880
And where are you off to?

10:53.880 --> 10:55.720
Oh, I found a spare
rasp for Tristan.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.880
He'll be almost done, won't he?

10:57.880 --> 11:00.040
Still, better safe than sorry.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.920
DOG WHIMPERS

11:14.680 --> 11:17.600
If you'd rather I...
No, of course not.

11:18.960 --> 11:21.120
In for a penny.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.520
Right.

11:29.520 --> 11:32.280
Let's take a look at your teeth,
then, shall we?

11:32.280 --> 11:34.680
HORSE NEIGHS LOUDLY

11:43.640 --> 11:46.760
That's it, that's it, old fella.
Come on.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.680
Nothing to worry about, that's it.

11:49.680 --> 11:52.760
I am just going to...
Ah!

11:55.040 --> 11:57.680
Are you all right, Triss?

11:57.680 --> 11:59.120
Did he get you?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.960
It's fine.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.520
He barely made contact.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.400
You sure?

12:06.400 --> 12:08.000
Uh-huh.

12:14.800 --> 12:17.440
He nearly broke my kneecap.
Seriously, Jim.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.640
I thought I was going to pass
out at one point.

12:19.640 --> 12:21.280
You should have let me take over.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.280
Oh, Siegfried would love that.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.800
"A man doesn't stop work
because of a bruise,

12:25.800 --> 12:28.000
"cuts and scrapes come with
the territory.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.200
"A good vet never puts his own
comfort before that of the animal."

12:32.920 --> 12:35.080
Caught you a good 'un, did he?

12:35.080 --> 12:38.040
Er, yes, yes.
It seems he did.

12:38.040 --> 12:41.000
Aye.
Evil bugger.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.640
HE CHUCKLES

12:46.960 --> 12:50.080
Well, he seems positively
delighted by the whole thing.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.400
They like to feel they're
getting their money's worth.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.120
What? So, the more pain and
suffering, the better?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.000
That's Dales folk for you.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
They're a sadistic bunch.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.920
Oh, I say, Mrs H, smells marvellous.
It really does.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.120
Yes, well, it's just bread
and cheese for now.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.480
So hands off.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.680
You really didn't need to
do all of this.

13:36.680 --> 13:38.920
Your birthday only comes
round once a year.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.240
Just eat up and then you can get
out from under me feet.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.640
Siegfried not around?

13:43.640 --> 13:45.840
Erm, no.
He, err, he went out.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.160
Out where?

13:51.160 --> 13:54.880
I think he, err,
was hoping to catch up with you.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.560
Something about a spare rasp.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.560
Seriously?
So he said.

13:59.560 --> 14:01.280
Unbelievable.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.760
He went to check up on me,
didn't he?

14:03.760 --> 14:06.520
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

14:06.520 --> 14:08.240
My apologies, Mrs Hall.

14:08.240 --> 14:10.680
You're all right.
Lunch is cold, anyway.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.200
Jolly good.

14:16.400 --> 14:19.760
I heard we missed you at the estate?
What?

14:19.760 --> 14:21.240
Oh, yes.
No matter.

14:21.240 --> 14:24.120
I just had a quick chat with
Monkham.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.160
So, what did Mr Monkham
have to say, then?

14:33.160 --> 14:34.440
Not a great deal.

14:34.440 --> 14:37.200
He did say you should learn to
move a bit quicker.

14:37.200 --> 14:40.200
You do have to watch yourself
with those stallions.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.440
Yes. I know.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.160
Nothing else?

14:45.160 --> 14:47.760
Should there have been?

14:47.760 --> 14:51.760
No, no, not at all.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.200
PHONE RINGS

14:54.200 --> 14:56.440
I'll get it.

14:58.840 --> 15:02.200
You know, I've been giving some
thought to those suggestions

15:02.200 --> 15:04.200
you made about the improvements.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.640
Oh, yes?

15:05.640 --> 15:08.680
We should sit down and start making
some plans together.

15:08.680 --> 15:11.320
That'd be great.
Thank you, Siegfried.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.000
All down to money, of course.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.760
But I think it's time.

15:16.520 --> 15:19.200
That was Dobson, his heifer's
in labour but it's not progressing.

15:19.200 --> 15:22.520
I said we'd head over to lend a
hand. Right, oh.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.640
James, weren't you going to
check on the Alderson's mare?

15:26.640 --> 15:29.320
I was but it's nothing that can't
wait. I can run by tomorrow.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.160
No, no.
You should go this afternoon.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.160
We mustn't let the Aldersons down.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.320
Tristan can manage at Dobson's.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.920
Can't you?

15:36.920 --> 15:40.880
Yes, yes, shouldn't be a problem.
That's settled, then.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.320
Except, how will I get there?

15:44.320 --> 15:47.280
You'll have to take the Rover.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.960
Oh, I, I think I'd probably be
better in the Vauxhall.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.400
James will need the Vauxhall.

15:54.400 --> 15:58.640
But still,
the Rover's your pride and joy.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.480
I can easily walk over to see
Hardwick's ewe.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.120
Besides, it'll go with the new bag.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.520
Now, just mind
the steering on the bends.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.440
Shut up.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.760
I'm sure you can handle it.

16:29.760 --> 16:31.920
Right.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.040
See you later.

16:51.560 --> 16:56.320
James, when you're done at the
Alderson's, perhaps you could call

16:56.320 --> 16:58.560
by and see how Triss is getting on?

16:58.560 --> 17:00.800
HORN BEEPS

17:03.640 --> 17:05.440
Wrong way.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.640
That might not be a bad idea.

17:11.120 --> 17:12.880
Oh, and...

17:12.880 --> 17:15.160
..I hope it goes well with Helen.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.040
HORSE NEIGHS

18:13.160 --> 18:15.360
Oh, hello again.
Hello.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.880
Just on my way to my next call.

18:16.880 --> 18:20.240
Thought I'd stop
and see how he's getting on.

18:20.240 --> 18:22.040
All right, there, boy?

18:22.040 --> 18:24.480
NEIGHS LOUDLY

18:24.480 --> 18:26.800
You know, I took extra special
care with his teeth.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.200
Thanks.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.720
Is that your car?

18:29.720 --> 18:31.040
Isn't she a beauty?

18:31.040 --> 18:32.600
It's very smart.

18:32.600 --> 18:35.040
Well, I'd best not keep this
one waiting...

18:35.040 --> 18:37.960
It's my birthday today.
Is it really?

18:37.960 --> 18:40.360
Well, many happy returns.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.600
Yes, well, I mean, I don't make a
big thing of them as a rule,

18:43.600 --> 18:46.760
but I am actually having a small
party, well, more of a dinner,

18:46.760 --> 18:48.920
a dinner party.

18:50.280 --> 18:52.960
Just a few close friends, erm,

18:52.960 --> 18:56.960
Helen Alderson will be there,
if you happen to be free.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.560
Oh, I haven't seen
Helen in an absolute age.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.040
I'm sure she'd be
thrilled to see you.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.280
So what d'you say?

19:04.280 --> 19:05.920
All right, then.

19:05.920 --> 19:07.920
I'll see you this evening.

19:07.920 --> 19:12.560
7:30, or 8:00,
or just, you know, come whenever.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.880
See you!

19:20.080 --> 19:21.960
GEESE CRY

19:31.560 --> 19:33.880
Mr Dobson, I got
here as fast as I could.

19:33.880 --> 19:36.320
Oh, aye?
You did the right thing calling.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.800
Has there been any progress?

19:37.800 --> 19:40.040
Well, no.
Not so's you'd notice.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.960
Then I shall begin with
a thorough examination.

19:42.960 --> 19:46.160
I'm afraid these things aren't
always as simple as they appear.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.440
I'll lead the way, shall I?

20:01.040 --> 20:03.440
Very good.
Nice and steady.

20:03.440 --> 20:05.440
I'll just check her...

20:05.440 --> 20:07.160
Such efficiency.

20:07.160 --> 20:09.000
We aim to please.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.840
RICHARD CLEARS THROAT

20:11.840 --> 20:13.760
Right.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.640
She's all right, then?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.320
Well, she's a way to go,

20:17.320 --> 20:22.120
but, yes, mother and foal are both
coming along very nicely.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.560
Heart-rate and....

20:27.680 --> 20:29.680
..temperature, all fine.

20:29.680 --> 20:32.440
In a few months' time,
you'll have your very own pony.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.000
Lucky girl.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.440
Candy were our mam's.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.080
Yeah, sort of like the next
generation.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.520
I see.
Besides, it's just practical.

20:40.520 --> 20:43.400
It takes forever to walk
up to the top field.

20:43.400 --> 20:46.480
'Course, if you'd let me drive the
tractor...

20:46.480 --> 20:50.080
Yeah, well, maybe's when your feet
reach the pedal's, you can.

20:50.080 --> 20:53.080
Dad, I've been tall enough for
months and you know it.

20:53.080 --> 20:56.560
Aye, annoying enough, you're
right...

20:56.560 --> 20:59.360
I'm practically an adult,
you know...

20:59.360 --> 21:02.920
She will be soon,
much as I hate to admit it.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.600
Come on, then.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.600
Thanks for coming up.
Not at all.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.840
Do I need to bring anything
this evening?

21:28.840 --> 21:31.120
I don't think so,
Mrs Hall has it all in hand.

21:31.120 --> 21:33.800
I didn't have Triss
down as the dinner-party sort.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.880
Ah, well, this is a whole new
Tristan we're talking about.

21:38.400 --> 21:40.960
Speaking of which...
I should get going.

21:40.960 --> 21:42.640
I said I'd check in on him.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.240
How's he getting on?

21:44.240 --> 21:47.040
Surprisingly well.
Good for him.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.920
It's good news for the rest of us,
too.

21:49.920 --> 21:53.080
Now he's out on calls,
we can split the night shifts.

21:53.080 --> 21:56.400
Up in, erm, Glasgow, I only had to
be on call once a week.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.200
I thought you liked being out
in the Dales under the moonlight?

21:59.200 --> 22:00.600
Oh, I do.

22:00.600 --> 22:03.160
It's just, I quite like a full
night's sleep, too.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.640
It's a good job you didn't
stay in Glasgow any longer, then,

22:05.640 --> 22:07.200
sounds like you'd have gone soft.

22:07.200 --> 22:09.360
Yeah.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.120
You're probably right.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.320
How you doing there, Tris?

22:41.320 --> 22:43.360
Thought I'd see
if you needed a hand.

22:43.360 --> 22:44.720
Mr Dobson.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.480
I'm managing as best I can
at the moment.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.240
Although, the presentation does...

22:52.080 --> 22:53.800
..present some serious difficulties.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.400
Both legs are back.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.320
It's got an incredibly long pelvis.

23:01.320 --> 23:03.320
It is long.

23:03.320 --> 23:05.800
Oh, God, here comes another!

23:05.800 --> 23:07.960
COW MOANS

23:15.440 --> 23:17.960
Erm, everything all right there,
Tris?

23:19.320 --> 23:20.560
I just need a moment.

23:25.400 --> 23:27.200
DOG WHINES

23:33.120 --> 23:35.440
WHINING STOPS

23:37.800 --> 23:39.040
Thank the Lord.

23:40.840 --> 23:43.640
DOG WAILS

23:43.640 --> 23:45.000
For the love of...

23:48.880 --> 23:52.480
What's wrong with you,
you daft ha'p'orth?

23:52.480 --> 23:54.000
Eh? Hmm?

23:55.360 --> 23:57.360
Oh, come on.

23:57.360 --> 24:00.680
Not nice, always being
on your own, is it? Mmm?

24:00.680 --> 24:02.120
Come on.

24:02.120 --> 24:04.880
But you so much as sniff at
my beef Wellington,

24:04.880 --> 24:06.160
you'll be out in the shed.

24:11.720 --> 24:13.440
Tris, do you want me to...?

24:16.280 --> 24:18.440
You poor lad.

24:18.440 --> 24:19.960
What can I do?

24:19.960 --> 24:21.600
Could you manage a sip of tea?

24:21.600 --> 24:22.640
Yes.

24:30.920 --> 24:32.920
Seriously,
you need to let me take over.

24:32.920 --> 24:35.720
I've come too far to stop now,
James.

24:35.720 --> 24:36.840
Can't be much longer.

24:42.840 --> 24:44.400
You brave lad.

24:44.400 --> 24:47.040
You've earned something much
stronger than a tea after this.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.160
Yes!

24:48.160 --> 24:49.680
Oh, God.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.640
Here we go again.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.160
COW AND TRISTAN GROAN

24:56.640 --> 24:58.440
Evening, Mrs Hall.

24:58.440 --> 25:01.200
Oh, don't worry, I'm early.
I thought you might need a hand.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.080
Oh, you are good.

25:03.080 --> 25:05.840
Well, those napkins need going on
the table.

25:05.840 --> 25:07.640
But take your coat off first.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.320
And will you call me Aud?

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
You've known me long enough.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.840
I can't believe what you've
pulled off here, Aud.

25:14.840 --> 25:17.320
If it were me, I'd have told Tris
he could have a cold buffet

25:17.320 --> 25:18.440
and count himself lucky.

25:18.440 --> 25:20.360
Oh, the cooking's no trouble.

25:20.360 --> 25:22.200
It's all the other madness.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.200
Siegfried up to his usual tricks,
is he?

25:25.200 --> 25:29.200
He's being...very nice. Oh.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.520
Even let Tristan drive the Rover.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.320
That's not like him. Well, no.

25:35.320 --> 25:38.360
I think Tristan's finding it
quite unnerving.

25:38.360 --> 25:40.520
To be honest, we all are.

25:40.520 --> 25:43.040
James says Tris is doing well,
though.

25:43.040 --> 25:44.400
So far, so good.

25:44.400 --> 25:48.640
He reckons it'll mean you can make
some changes around here. Seems so.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.920
I think he got used to the easy life
in Glasgow.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.120
To be honest,
I'm half surprised ever came back.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.320
I think his mother
was certainly keen for him

25:55.320 --> 25:57.040
to accept the permanent position.

25:59.800 --> 26:01.120
Did they offer him one?

26:05.840 --> 26:06.880
Apparently.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.520
I don't know all the details.

26:13.520 --> 26:14.560
Right.

26:16.040 --> 26:18.000
He didn't say anything. Did he not?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.360
Now, I think we're just about ready.

26:21.360 --> 26:25.280
Though, with that blessed Labrador
howling nonstop earlier,

26:25.280 --> 26:27.600
I'm just hoping I haven't put
peas in the blancmange.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.640
Good feeling, isn't it?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.680
It really is.

26:40.680 --> 26:41.720
First calf.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.360
And I didn't mess it up.

26:56.720 --> 26:59.040
Thanks again, Mr Farnon.

26:59.040 --> 27:01.200
You take care now. Will do.

27:01.200 --> 27:03.120
HE STRAINS
Good evening, Mr Dobson.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.920
You're sure you'll be all right,
driving with that shoulder?

27:07.920 --> 27:10.120
We can easily leave the Rover
and we could...

27:14.520 --> 27:16.760
You bugger!

27:19.080 --> 27:21.400
You were putting that on?

27:21.400 --> 27:24.440
You've got to admit,
it was an inspired performance.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.880
I'll tell you something,

27:25.880 --> 27:29.760
Siegfried is going to get a glowing
report from Mr Dobson.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.800
Yeah, I suppose.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.160
Siegfried really is proud of you,
you know.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.320
No, he's not.

27:37.320 --> 27:40.440
But maybe after today, he might stop
thinking I'm a hopeless case.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.000
Helen, you're here!

27:55.000 --> 27:57.320
Oh, happy birthday, Tris.

27:57.320 --> 27:58.520
James.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.120
Hello, there.

28:00.120 --> 28:02.960
Have you seen Siegfried?

28:02.960 --> 28:06.600
He said something about a telephone
call from Mr Dobson.

28:06.600 --> 28:08.560
Right.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.680
I'd better go change.

28:11.640 --> 28:13.280
Everything OK?

28:13.280 --> 28:14.960
Mmm-hmm.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.680
I should take these through.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.080
No, that's very helpful, Mr Dobson.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.160
Thank you. Yes, and you.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.760
Siegfried.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.040
Everything all right?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.840
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.160
Right, yes. All good.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.160
One calf delivered safe and sound.

28:33.160 --> 28:34.200
As one would hope.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.720
DOORBELL

28:37.720 --> 28:40.880
Well, go on, then, get yourself
dressed, you've guests arriving.

28:40.880 --> 28:43.520
I just thought you might want to...
I'll get it, shall I?

28:43.520 --> 28:44.760
Yes.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.160
No, I should.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.280
Mrs Brompton, hello.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.200
Thank you.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.360
I do hope I'm not too early.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.400
Not at all, you're right on time.

28:58.400 --> 29:01.480
Diana. Siegfried.

29:01.480 --> 29:04.000
My, how dashing you look. Thank you.

29:04.000 --> 29:08.240
A spot of blue ruin, for when you
boys huddle up with your port.

29:08.240 --> 29:11.600
No need for me and Mrs Hall to
miss out. Don't you agree?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.400
Very kind of you, I'm sure.

29:13.400 --> 29:16.040
Come in.
DOORBELL

29:16.040 --> 29:18.000
So, where's the birthday boy?

29:18.000 --> 29:21.320
I hope, changing into
less-odoriferous attire.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.640
Oh, Siegfried, you are dreadful.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.800
Good evening.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.200
Margot Sebright Saunders.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.400
Tristan did say to come at 7:30?

29:35.400 --> 29:37.400
Yes, of course.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.120
Please, do come in. Thank you.

29:45.680 --> 29:48.240
So lovely to finally meet you,
Mrs Farnon.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.400
These are for you.

29:49.400 --> 29:50.720
No, I'm not...

29:50.720 --> 29:53.040
Siegfried, honestly.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.360
Is something you haven't told me?

29:55.360 --> 29:57.640
I'm Mrs Hall, the housekeeper.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.600
Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.240
Erm, should I...?

30:02.320 --> 30:03.960
I'll just put these in water.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.360
Margot, do come in.

30:09.040 --> 30:13.880
Now, then, ladies, if this
amontillado is too dry for you,

30:13.880 --> 30:15.400
I do have something sweeter.

30:15.400 --> 30:18.400
Oh, I think we're sweet enough
already, don't you, Margot?

30:18.400 --> 30:19.560
Oh, yes, absolutely!

30:20.600 --> 30:24.160
Helen, I believe you know
Ms Sebright Saunders? Helen!

30:24.160 --> 30:25.560
So lovely to see you.

30:25.560 --> 30:26.920
Margot, how are you?

30:26.920 --> 30:28.560
Oh, I'm perfectly fine.

30:28.560 --> 30:29.760
But how are you?

30:29.760 --> 30:32.800
I was simply devastated about
you and Hugh.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.120
We all were.

30:36.240 --> 30:38.000
Oh, that's very kind of you.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.120
I'm so glad to see you out
and about, despite everything.

30:42.120 --> 30:44.400
Right, here we are. Thank you.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.680
What's all that about? Hmm?

30:50.680 --> 30:52.560
Oh, Margot was an old pal of Hugh's.

30:52.560 --> 30:54.440
Family friends or what have you.

30:54.440 --> 30:56.200
You didn't think
to mention that before?

30:56.200 --> 30:59.200
Has he said anything to you?
Who? Siegfried.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.200
I know he's spoken
to Dobson on the phone.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.840
If he thinks I've botched
it somehow,

31:02.840 --> 31:04.440
why doesn't he just say something?

31:04.440 --> 31:07.000
If you'd all like to come through,

31:07.000 --> 31:08.440
dinner is served.

31:25.080 --> 31:29.400
So, Margot, how's that
May mare of your father's?

31:29.400 --> 31:31.960
Will he be entering her
on the northwest circuit?

31:31.960 --> 31:35.200
I should think so.
She's showing excellent form.

31:35.200 --> 31:37.080
I look forward to seeing
her in action.

31:37.080 --> 31:39.680
Well, she'll be up against the
Hulton's new gelding.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.400
He's having a pretty good season.

31:43.280 --> 31:46.840
Just a shame Hugh's missing all
the events.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.200
Who's this?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.360
Erm, Hugh Hulton. Oh.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.840
I keep telling him,
should just come back from France.

31:52.840 --> 31:56.040
I'm sure he's having
a fine old time. I doubt it.

31:56.040 --> 31:59.160
He said he felt too ashamed to
show his face in Darrowby.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.240
Though what he's got to be
ashamed of, I really don't know.

32:03.240 --> 32:05.480
Hugh has nothing to be ashamed of.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.000
But I had to be honest with him.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.320
The longer I let it go on,

32:09.320 --> 32:11.080
the worse it would have
got for both of us.

32:11.080 --> 32:13.560
I agree.
Far better to make a clean break.

32:13.560 --> 32:15.720
No point in prolonging the agony.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.920
I suppose not.

32:27.320 --> 32:30.600
You know, Mrs Hall,
this soup is absolutely first-rate.

32:30.600 --> 32:32.600
ALL AGREE

32:32.600 --> 32:35.120
Best one yet, Mrs H.
Oh, it were no bother at all.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.280
No, that's going in the pantry...

32:40.280 --> 32:42.000
GENERAL CHATTER

32:44.280 --> 32:45.600
Especially for you, Tris.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.480
Oh, good choice, James.

32:50.160 --> 32:51.840
GLASS CHIMES

32:51.840 --> 32:55.840
If I might have your attention
for a moment, ladies and gentlemen.

32:55.840 --> 33:00.600
First of all, Mrs Hall, thank you
for making such a delicious meal,

33:00.600 --> 33:03.720
beef of which Wellington
would be proud.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.240
Hear, hear. Hear, hear.

33:05.240 --> 33:09.200
Now, as some of you know, today was
not only my brother's birthday,

33:09.200 --> 33:12.800
it was also his first day
out on call as lead vet.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.240
Goodness! How exciting.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.640
Now, to say that
I had my reservations...

33:17.640 --> 33:19.080
Would be putting it mildly.

33:20.520 --> 33:23.160
And I admit I thought
it prudent to keep a close eye

33:23.160 --> 33:25.680
on his progress
throughout the day.

33:25.680 --> 33:29.920
Having said all that,
to my surprise,

33:29.920 --> 33:34.200
and, dare I say it, delight,

33:34.200 --> 33:37.080
the reports of his work have been

33:37.080 --> 33:38.720
uniformly excellent.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.840
So, a toast.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.000
To Tristan.

33:45.000 --> 33:49.040
Many happy returns and my heartfelt
congratulations.

33:51.360 --> 33:52.680
ALL: To Tristan.

33:57.120 --> 33:58.240
Well done.

34:05.440 --> 34:06.480
That was lovely.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.760
You sound almost like a
proud father.

34:09.760 --> 34:14.240
Yes, well, I suppose in a way,
that's how I feel.

34:14.240 --> 34:15.760
DOG WHINES

34:15.760 --> 34:17.320
Oh, no. Good heavens, what's that?

34:17.320 --> 34:19.520
Oh, it's fine,
she'll calm down in a minute.

34:19.520 --> 34:21.080
It sounds like something's in pain.

34:21.080 --> 34:23.760
I almost wonder if it might
be a post-operative complication.

34:23.760 --> 34:26.440
It's not a complication, she just
doesn't like being on her own.

34:26.440 --> 34:28.280
I'll let her out as soon
as we've finished.

34:28.280 --> 34:29.760
I'd be more than happy to
take a look.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.960
I've already examined her
thoroughly, thank you.

34:31.960 --> 34:33.680
You know, the thing
I've realised today is,

34:33.680 --> 34:36.760
it doesn't matter how good a vet
you are, people only respect you

34:36.760 --> 34:38.960
once they see you putting in
the hard graft.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.840
Well, no-one could fault you there,
Tris. No.

34:40.840 --> 34:42.160
Because, at the end of the day,

34:42.160 --> 34:44.800
I'm not afraid to go the extra mile,
if that's what it takes.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.120
You certainly went all out.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.840
If it's sweat and tears they want,
I'll give it to them.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.920
If you've done anything to embarrass
this practice, Tristan...

34:53.920 --> 34:56.200
No, no, not at all.

34:56.200 --> 34:59.080
I may have exaggerated the effort
involved a little.

34:59.080 --> 35:00.520
No, really?

35:02.840 --> 35:06.120
A few well-placed groans,
some unnecessarily straining sinews

35:06.120 --> 35:08.720
and a final howl of pain.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.560
Goodness!

35:10.560 --> 35:11.880
A final what?

35:11.880 --> 35:16.120
Ah, I may have got slightly carried
away but it had the desired effect.

35:16.120 --> 35:17.160
What is wrong with you?

35:18.360 --> 35:21.360
For God's sake,
after that fiasco with the chickens?

35:21.360 --> 35:24.960
I thought you'd finally come to your
senses. And I have, absolutely...

35:24.960 --> 35:27.840
I thought you'd finally started to
take responsibly for your actions.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.640
Complete responsibility, totally.
But fair's fair, old chap,

35:30.640 --> 35:32.920
you're hardly averse
to putting on a show yourself.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.920
I would never resort to playacting
and tomfoolery.

35:35.920 --> 35:38.440
Oh, come off it.
You and your purple powder?

35:38.440 --> 35:41.120
Blinding the great unwashed with
the magic of science.

35:41.120 --> 35:43.320
That is entirely different.
I don't see how.

35:43.320 --> 35:45.760
Because I know what I'm doing.
Yes, well, so do I.

35:45.760 --> 35:49.000
I seriously doubt that. Well, I've
got the qualifications to prove it.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.160
So you think.

35:55.760 --> 35:56.800
Wait, what?

36:06.440 --> 36:08.240
Why don't we all go through,
everyone?

36:08.240 --> 36:10.520
I can make us some drinks
and see to that dog.

36:21.960 --> 36:23.440
Are you saying I didn't pass?

36:35.160 --> 36:37.120
You told me that I passed.

36:37.120 --> 36:39.880
You said categorically... I know.

36:39.880 --> 36:44.120
I may have...omitted one or two
of the finer details.

36:44.120 --> 36:45.240
So, I didn't pass.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.640
You narrowly missed the mark on
one paper, parasitology.

36:48.640 --> 36:52.720
But really, in the great scheme
of things, just a tiny, white lie.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.920
You're not serious.

36:54.920 --> 36:58.520
You tried so hard and I knew how
disappointed you'd be, so I just...

36:58.520 --> 37:01.000
I bent the truth a little.

37:02.880 --> 37:06.120
You let me think I was qualified
when I wasn't.

37:06.120 --> 37:10.040
And then you let me carry on showing
off like a complete idiot.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.240
All this time, I've been a
total laughing stock.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.720
Oh, for God's sake, you'd already
wasted so much time on those

37:14.720 --> 37:17.440
blasted exams, I thought you'd be
better off getting out there,

37:17.440 --> 37:20.840
getting your hands dirty, and I've
been proven right, haven't I?

37:20.840 --> 37:22.480
I don't believe you.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.840
Even now, you can't admit that
you're in the wrong.

37:24.840 --> 37:27.000
I don't see that I am, necessarily.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.440
Oh, well, there's a surprise.

37:37.720 --> 37:40.760
Well, thank you so much for dinner.

37:40.760 --> 37:43.320
It were very nice to meet you.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.760
Only, Tristan did say
he would drive me home.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.800
Not to worry,
I can give you a lift, Margot.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.200
That's awfully kind of you.

37:51.880 --> 37:55.120
I'm sorry about all this.
Please, don't apologise.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.680
We shall have to have that
gin sometime.

38:01.080 --> 38:02.160
Helen.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.040
I'm sorry.

38:06.040 --> 38:09.600
I appreciate now that it can't have
been easy for you either.

38:09.600 --> 38:12.400
It's fine, Margot. Really. Well...

38:13.920 --> 38:16.120
..I hope you'll both be very happy.

38:18.120 --> 38:19.600
Come on, Margot!

38:22.160 --> 38:23.200
Goodnight, ladies.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
You're sure
I can't help you tidy up?

38:29.000 --> 38:31.480
Oh, I think a discreet exit's
probably best.

38:33.600 --> 38:35.520
Thanks for this. Enjoy.

39:00.760 --> 39:03.120
I made you some blancmange.

39:03.120 --> 39:05.560
I'm sticking to liquids,
thanks all the same.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.760
Tris... Did you know?

39:18.360 --> 39:20.160
Why didn't you tell me?

39:20.160 --> 39:21.280
I'm so sorry.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.960
I only found out later.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.400
And your brother's intentions
weren't bad.

39:31.760 --> 39:34.000
Even if, perhaps, his methods were.

39:37.880 --> 39:40.280
Didn't even buy the bag, did he?

39:40.280 --> 39:43.000
He was still the one
who paid for it.

39:46.880 --> 39:51.640
You have no idea how much
he cares for you.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.080
And worries about you.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.760
It's just hard for him...
Hard for him?

40:01.760 --> 40:03.240
That's rich.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.760
I am truly sorry.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.760
Siegfried's outdone himself
this time.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.160
I mean, I'm sure he meant well...

40:53.160 --> 40:55.600
But the road to hell is paved
with good intentions.

41:00.560 --> 41:04.440
So, what will it mean for the
practice if Tris isn't stepping up?

41:04.440 --> 41:06.800
Well, I suppose any modernisation
will have to wait.

41:11.840 --> 41:16.320
Helen, there's something to talk
to you about. It's about Glasgow.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.040
They offered you a job.

41:19.280 --> 41:21.160
How did you...?
Audrey thought I knew.

41:23.560 --> 41:25.240
Right.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.120
I'm so sorry,
I've been wanting to tell you.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.040
Are you considering it?

41:34.040 --> 41:35.280
I see.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.320
It's not...

41:38.320 --> 41:41.240
The chap I was covering for
is leaving,

41:41.240 --> 41:43.800
so they need to replace him
and, well,

41:43.800 --> 41:45.680
Bill told my mum and next thing
I know,

41:45.680 --> 41:47.360
she told him I'm taking the job.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.520
Right.

41:50.720 --> 41:53.320
And are you? No, I...

41:53.320 --> 41:55.080
I don't know.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.320
I need to make a decision but
whatever I decide,

41:57.320 --> 41:58.720
I'll be letting people down.

41:58.720 --> 42:00.960
Oh, James,
why didn't you say something?

42:00.960 --> 42:03.920
I didn't want you to feel like I was
putting pressure on you.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.480
How do you mean?

42:08.720 --> 42:10.160
Helen...

42:11.720 --> 42:13.000
..I want to be with you.

42:16.640 --> 42:21.000
And that means staying in Darrowby,
and I love it here, I do.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.800
The place, the work, the people.

42:24.760 --> 42:26.320
But if I stay...

42:26.320 --> 42:27.960
You'll break your mother's heart.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.000
They've given up so much for me.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.000
I don't know what I'm going to do.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.480
Well then, we'll just have to work
something out, won't we?

42:57.280 --> 42:59.680
Stay for another brew.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.760
I'd love to.

43:02.160 --> 43:04.160
But I better get back
and check on Tris.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.680
DOOR OPENS

43:21.200 --> 43:22.560
Have the others turned in?

43:26.040 --> 43:27.080
Are you all right?

43:28.360 --> 43:30.360
Just dandy.

43:30.360 --> 43:32.280
I mean,
I've been publicly humiliated,

43:32.280 --> 43:33.840
shown up as a laughing stock...

43:33.840 --> 43:37.800
Tris... ..but I'm exacting
my revenge with a very fine malt.

43:39.400 --> 43:41.800
Is that Siegfried's special bottle?

43:41.800 --> 43:43.800
Certainly was.

43:43.800 --> 43:44.840
Here.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.440
Come on.

43:49.120 --> 43:50.880
Misery loves company and all that.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.720
Would it have made a difference
if you'd found out sooner?

43:57.720 --> 44:01.560
What, that I'm a complete failure?

44:01.560 --> 44:04.360
Don't know.
Maybe ignorance was bliss.

44:04.360 --> 44:07.040
There are plenty of fine vets with
no qualifications.

44:08.920 --> 44:12.040
You know you can do the work,
that's what matters.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.000
Come on.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.920
Where are we going?

44:19.920 --> 44:23.480
Unless I'm mistaken,
it's still my birthday,

44:23.480 --> 44:26.440
so I say we go and get blasted
at the Drovers.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.640
All right, then.

44:27.640 --> 44:29.440
And bring the whisky.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.360
You know, we should have just gone

44:31.360 --> 44:33.560
to the bloody pub in
the first place.

45:02.560 --> 45:04.600
