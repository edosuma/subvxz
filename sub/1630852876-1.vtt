00:08.275 --> 00:11.827
[Narrator] Reaching the other side
of the world has never been easier.

00:11.862 --> 00:15.931
But by flying over, are we
forgetting how to travel through?

00:19.758 --> 00:21.103
Mexico City,

00:21.137 --> 00:24.862
North America's
largest Metropolis,

00:24.896 --> 00:27.758
to ushuaia, Argentina,

00:27.793 --> 00:30.241
the most southerly
city in the world.

00:30.275 --> 00:32.724
Twenty hours by plane.

00:32.758 --> 00:35.758
But could you travel the
length of Latin America

00:35.793 --> 00:38.137
without boarding a single flight

00:38.172 --> 00:40.482
and all for the price
of the air fares?

00:40.517 --> 00:43.206
[Man] What have we got
ourselves into? [Woman chuckles]

00:43.241 --> 00:46.206
[Narrator] Five
pairs of ordinary brits

00:46.241 --> 00:48.896
are attempting just that.

00:48.931 --> 00:50.103
Let's go.

00:50.137 --> 00:53.206
They will cover over
25,000 kilometers

00:53.241 --> 00:55.241
at ground level...

00:55.275 --> 00:58.379
There are moments I guess you'll
remember for the rest of your life.

00:58.413 --> 00:59.586
[Narrator] And are demanding.

00:59.620 --> 01:00.896
Don't cry coz you get weak.

01:00.931 --> 01:02.724
[Narrator] And
challenging race...

01:02.758 --> 01:03.827
Let's all go there.

01:03.862 --> 01:06.344
[Narrator]... which
soars high into the andes

01:06.379 --> 01:08.586
crosses vast deserts

01:08.620 --> 01:10.206
and goes deep into the jungle.

01:10.241 --> 01:11.448
Come on. What's next?

01:12.689 --> 01:15.241
[Narrator] They must
negotiate volatile regions...

01:15.275 --> 01:16.827
We gotta be
careful with the gun.

01:16.862 --> 01:19.137
Without the help of smartphones.

01:19.172 --> 01:22.517
Bank cards and
with a limited budget.

01:22.551 --> 01:25.482
Got no Google maps,
got no mom, got nothing.

01:25.517 --> 01:29.034
[Narrator] Have they got
what it takes both physically

01:29.068 --> 01:31.517
- someone call an ambulance.
- If you were flying,

01:31.551 --> 01:33.734
you don't really meet the
real people of these countries.

01:33.758 --> 01:34.838
[Narrator] ...And emotionally.

01:34.862 --> 01:38.310
He's quite clearly
changing for the better.

01:38.344 --> 01:40.344
We need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:40.379 --> 01:42.724
I feel like this is has
brought us closer together.

01:42.758 --> 01:45.448
[Narrator] The
rewards are great.

01:45.482 --> 01:46.758
This is crazy good.

01:48.965 --> 01:50.896
[Narrator] The first
team to the finish line

01:50.931 --> 01:54.068

[man 1] Let's go, let's go.
[Man 2] Thomas, Thomas.

02:00.724 --> 02:03.310
Excitement, adventure trauma.

02:04.275 --> 02:05.275
Oh, my god.

02:12.965 --> 02:15.896
[Spanish song playing]

02:22.310 --> 02:24.344
[Narrator] Built on
an ancient lake bed

02:24.379 --> 02:27.551
almost 2,000 meters
above sea level

02:27.586 --> 02:30.896
and watched over
by an active volcano,

02:30.931 --> 02:33.275
Mexico City.

02:35.034 --> 02:38.689
Twenty one million people are
crammed into this megalopolis,

02:40.241 --> 02:42.965
one of the most densely
populated cities in the world.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.413
Think we're quite high up.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.379
- I'm already out of breath.
- [Chuckles]

02:48.413 --> 02:50.896
[Narrator] The race begins
in the heart of the city,

02:53.413 --> 02:54.896
chapultepec castle.

02:55.793 --> 02:57.586
This castle's beautiful.

02:58.517 --> 03:00.103
I'm not sure it's a castle, dom.

03:00.137 --> 03:01.517
[Man] I think it is.

03:01.551 --> 03:04.068
[Narrator] First to
arrive dom and Lizzie,

03:04.103 --> 03:06.034
siblings from Yorkshire.

03:06.068 --> 03:08.931
[Dom] I don't think I have a
picture doing this with my sister

03:08.965 --> 03:10.965
I think traveling around
the world was something...

03:11.000 --> 03:13.758
- something you do with your mates, yeah.
- Yeah.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.724
[Lizzie] When we were
younger, we were so close.

03:15.758 --> 03:17.137
We used to make plays together,

03:17.172 --> 03:19.034
dance, climb trees.

03:19.068 --> 03:21.241
Our village was our playground.

03:21.275 --> 03:23.827
[Lizzie] Can you see the
volcanoes over there? [Dom] Wow.

03:23.862 --> 03:25.482
[Lizzie] But we've grown apart.

03:25.517 --> 03:27.896
I would say we're siblings,
not friends anymore.

03:27.931 --> 03:29.493
- [Dom] You can say that.
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

03:29.517 --> 03:32.517
- There's no better way to save our relationship than this.
- Mm.

03:33.724 --> 03:35.034
[Narrator] Next
to join the race,

03:35.068 --> 03:38.517
couple of three years,
Michael and shuntelle.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.448
[Shuntelle] We were
brought together by tinder.

03:41.482 --> 03:43.344
- [Both chuckle]
- We swiped.

03:46.034 --> 03:48.965
She was hooked and
couldn't keep away from me.

03:51.620 --> 03:54.586
[Shuntelle] I work for a large
international accountancy firm

03:54.620 --> 03:57.172
I have to admit my first
business class travel trip,

03:57.206 --> 03:58.886
I was like, "oh, I
could get used to this."

03:59.965 --> 04:02.689
But Michael is ex-army.

04:02.724 --> 04:04.034
He loves a challenge.

04:04.068 --> 04:06.241
- This matches, yeah?
- Gotta.

04:06.275 --> 04:08.586
I've made him do
all-inclusive holidays

04:08.620 --> 04:10.596
coz he needs an adventure,
and that's the difference.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.379
[Man] Buenos dias.

04:12.413 --> 04:15.103
So this is our first test
of what an adventure

04:15.137 --> 04:16.137
together looks like.

04:17.241 --> 04:19.206
[Speaking Spanish]

04:25.586 --> 04:27.379
I would need your mobile phones,

04:27.413 --> 04:29.241
your credit cards and
all your cash, please.

04:29.275 --> 04:32.241
[Both] This is everything I
have. [Man] Put it here, please.

04:32.275 --> 04:34.655
[Narrator] Stripped of all the
trappings of modern day life,

04:34.689 --> 04:36.620
the teams receive in return

04:36.655 --> 04:40.896
a world map, a travel
guide, money belts

04:40.931 --> 04:44.068
and for their safety,
a GPS tracker.

04:44.103 --> 04:45.758
[Man] Good luck.

04:45.793 --> 04:49.068
I think it's gonna be fantastic
experience. I can't wait for it.

04:49.103 --> 04:50.931
[Narrator] Third
up, mother and son

04:50.965 --> 04:53.103
Jo and Sam from Manchester.

04:53.137 --> 04:55.724
- Are you nervous?
- Well, I am, but I don't admit it.

04:55.758 --> 04:57.724
[Woman chuckles] We'll be fine.

04:57.758 --> 04:59.217
[Sam] It's a perfect
time to go traveling now

04:59.241 --> 05:02.862
because my mum's getting
to the age where she's too old.

05:02.896 --> 05:04.862
- [Laughs]
- And...

05:04.896 --> 05:07.724
I think now, with the
state that she's in now,

05:07.758 --> 05:09.862
that she's just able to do it.

05:09.896 --> 05:11.596
[Jo] I'm so glad that I
brought you. [Chuckles]

05:11.620 --> 05:15.344
Probably I don't have many
backpacking years left in me.

05:15.379 --> 05:16.482
Thanks, love.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.620
I know he's always
wanted to travel.

05:18.655 --> 05:20.655
And I thought it would
be really good fun

05:20.689 --> 05:22.413
to watch Sam see the world

05:22.448 --> 05:24.631
and hopefully give you the
confidence to enable you to...

05:24.655 --> 05:26.862
Go on my own and do all myself.

05:26.896 --> 05:28.896
- Well, hopefully that's what we get out to.
- Yeah.

05:28.931 --> 05:31.068
[Man speaking Spanish]

05:31.862 --> 05:33.551
- I'm Jo.
- Sam.

05:33.586 --> 05:35.862
[Both speaking Spanish]

05:39.103 --> 05:41.758
[Man] Wow. OMG.

05:41.793 --> 05:43.620
Mexico.

05:43.655 --> 05:46.862
[Narrator] Recently reunited
after a family estrangement,

05:46.896 --> 05:50.517
uncle and nephew
emon and jamiul.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.724
[Man] I can't believe
we're starting in Mexico.

05:52.758 --> 05:55.793
[Jamiul] When I was younger,
we were really quite close.

05:55.827 --> 05:58.113
I used to look up to him quite
a bit. I still do look up to him.

05:58.137 --> 06:01.931
Let's do this. Come
on. We're here now.

06:01.965 --> 06:03.275
In the past ten years,

06:03.310 --> 06:06.448
I don't think we've
spent a full day together.

06:06.482 --> 06:09.413
[Emon] It's gonna be a
learning curve for both of us.

06:09.448 --> 06:11.413
He always was kind
of following me around

06:11.448 --> 06:12.931
when we he was like 12-13.

06:12.965 --> 06:15.068
[Man] See you soon.

06:15.103 --> 06:15.931
And it's happened now.

06:15.965 --> 06:18.310
He's pulling me
around the world.

06:21.379 --> 06:23.689
- Pretty scary, isn't it?
- I feel so nervous.

06:23.724 --> 06:25.344
- Now that it is real.
- I feel sick.

06:25.379 --> 06:27.586

06:31.034 --> 06:32.379
We've been married five years.

06:32.413 --> 06:33.931
Four years. It's four years.

06:35.413 --> 06:38.206
We've been married
for four and a half years.

06:38.241 --> 06:40.241
- Look at the size of this place.
- Oh my geez.

06:40.275 --> 06:44.448
How even gonna
get like out of the city?

06:44.482 --> 06:45.482
I don't know.

06:46.896 --> 06:50.000
We actually think that we're
quite awful travelers, don't we?

06:50.034 --> 06:51.206
[Rob chuckles] Yeah.

06:51.241 --> 06:53.251
[Jen] I just always think
everybody's trying to Rob me

06:53.275 --> 06:54.275
all the time.

06:55.103 --> 06:56.965
I do not speak any languages.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.079
You know a little
bit of Spanish.

06:58.103 --> 07:00.310
I don't know any Spanish.
He thinks I know Spanish.

07:00.344 --> 07:02.655
I don't know any Spanish. Non.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.275
I can say hi and
order a glass of wine

07:04.310 --> 07:05.355
if that's gonna get me far.

07:05.379 --> 07:06.620
Thank you.

07:06.655 --> 07:08.000
Thanks very much and good luck.

07:08.034 --> 07:10.689
Oh, god. Okay.
AdiÃ³s, amigos. Bye.

07:10.724 --> 07:11.655
[Both chuckle]

07:11.689 --> 07:12.931
Do we really have a game plan?

07:12.965 --> 07:16.000
We don't have a game plan.
Should we have a game plan?

07:16.034 --> 07:18.862
That panics me. Have other
people got a game plan?

07:18.896 --> 07:21.206
Teams fully equipped,

07:21.241 --> 07:23.827
it's time to find out where
the race will take them.

07:23.862 --> 07:25.448
So here it is.

07:26.793 --> 07:30.482
- So the race begins at 2:30.
- Oh.

07:30.517 --> 07:32.689
- The final destination is...
- Oh my god.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.275
You sure...

07:35.310 --> 07:37.689

- Ushuaia.

07:37.724 --> 07:39.137
Ushuaia.

07:41.655 --> 07:43.172
Ushuaia.

07:43.206 --> 07:44.793
I have no idea.

07:44.827 --> 07:46.137
We have got a map, yeah.

07:47.517 --> 07:49.448
[Emon] Let's have a look.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.034
This is it.

07:51.068 --> 07:52.862
Maybe flip the paper.

07:52.896 --> 07:55.413
I can't imagine
we're going that far.

07:55.448 --> 07:59.275
- Oh, there it is.
- No way, no way. No way.

07:59.310 --> 08:02.689
- Ushuaia.
- [Indistinct]

08:02.724 --> 08:08.103
[Narrator] The finish line and most
southerly city in the world, ushuaia.

08:08.137 --> 08:11.206
More than 25,000 kms away.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.724
To get there, for
each team member

08:13.758 --> 08:16.034
just over Â£1400.

08:16.068 --> 08:18.275
The equivalent cost of flying.

08:18.310 --> 08:20.482
Right so we've got...
Let's count it and see,

08:20.517 --> 08:21.862
and we got American.

08:21.896 --> 08:26.275
[Narrator] A budget of
around just Â£26 each, a day.

08:26.310 --> 08:28.448
I don't think it is
a lot for a week.

08:28.482 --> 08:30.862
That's food, travel

08:30.896 --> 08:33.079
-and accommodation. That's everything, innit?
-[Emon] Yeah.

08:33.103 --> 08:35.172
- Don't lose that, please.
- I won't, I won't.

08:35.206 --> 08:37.379
[Narrator] On the way,
they must pass through

08:37.413 --> 08:39.034
seven checkpoints

08:39.068 --> 08:42.551
spanning the length and
breadth of Latin America.

08:42.586 --> 08:43.931
Only when they reach one

08:43.965 --> 08:47.000
will they learn where
the next will be.

08:47.034 --> 08:49.655
The first checkpoint
is copÃ¡n ruinas.

08:49.689 --> 08:52.068
I haven't got the
foggiest idea where it is.

08:52.103 --> 08:53.344
Can I have a look?

08:53.379 --> 08:55.241
- No.
- Okay.

08:55.275 --> 08:56.424
I don't think it'd
be on the map.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.862
Why not? How are
we going to get there?

08:58.896 --> 09:00.931
We're just gonna have to
find someone who tells us.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.827
[Narrator] With the
race about to begin...

09:03.862 --> 09:05.827

to size up the opposition

09:15.241 --> 09:17.172

09:19.000 --> 09:21.344

09:36.103 --> 09:38.586
[Jo] The last time I did a
lot of traveling, I was 24.

09:40.655 --> 09:42.586
My body's got 30 years older.

09:44.793 --> 09:46.896
- Let's just grab the race by the balls.
- Dominique.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.724
[Shuntelle] Just so anxious.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.413
I've never even put
a pack on my back.

09:53.448 --> 09:54.488
You see, I'm known for me.

09:55.448 --> 09:58.172
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.931
[Emon] I won't go into something,
if I don't believe I could win it.

10:02.965 --> 10:04.241
No one remembers second place.

10:04.275 --> 10:05.555
I don't believe in second place.

10:14.068 --> 10:15.034
[Clock dings]

10:15.068 --> 10:18.103
[All] Let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

10:22.517 --> 10:24.137
- Why are you running?
- I don't know.

10:24.172 --> 10:26.113
[Rob] We'll have to find out
where the first checkpoint is.

10:26.137 --> 10:29.172
[Jen] Yeah. We can ask
some people to help us.

10:29.206 --> 10:31.344
[Cheers]

10:31.379 --> 10:33.172
[Dom] Oh god.

10:33.206 --> 10:36.206
I probably should have gone
to the toilet before starting.

10:43.758 --> 10:45.482
[Emon] Excuse me.
Do you speak English?

10:45.517 --> 10:48.000
[Narrator] Escaping from
this chaotic Metropolis

10:48.034 --> 10:50.689
has the potential to be
difficult and time consuming.

10:50.724 --> 10:52.689
- [Shuntelle] Hold on a minute.
- [Cars honking]

10:52.724 --> 10:54.448
[Michael] Oh, come on.

10:54.482 --> 10:56.689
[Dom] I'm sorry. Do
you speak English?

10:56.724 --> 10:57.689
[Man] No.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.586
[Narrator] Without
their mobile phones...

10:59.620 --> 11:03.275
[Emon] CopÃ¡n ruinas. You
know where that place is?

11:03.310 --> 11:05.206
[Speaks Spanish]

11:05.241 --> 11:07.344
[Narrator]
...Communication is key.

11:07.379 --> 11:09.103
[Emon] We're
very lost right now.

11:09.137 --> 11:12.620
Nobody really speaks English.
We don't speak Spanish either.

11:12.655 --> 11:13.931
Can't really speak to anyone.

11:19.620 --> 11:20.862
[Stutters]

11:20.896 --> 11:23.862
The taxi and the
Metro, which is...

11:23.896 --> 11:25.655
[Man speaking Spanish]

11:29.724 --> 11:31.310
[Sam] I'm struggling a bit.

11:31.344 --> 11:32.758
I didn't think it'd be this hard

11:32.793 --> 11:34.517
just to get somewhere.

11:37.034 --> 11:39.586
Sam, we need to get to the
traffic light so we can cross there.

11:40.689 --> 11:42.251
- [Jo] We're new right now.
- [Sam] Yeah.

11:42.275 --> 11:43.793
We'll be okay together.

11:43.827 --> 11:47.586
Sam is a complete pain in the
ass throughout his childhood.

11:47.620 --> 11:50.827
He really struggled at
school. He has adhd.

11:50.862 --> 11:52.724
So he started off in mainstream

11:52.758 --> 11:54.620
and then ended up in
special needs schools.

11:56.655 --> 11:58.758
Things like booking a ticket

11:58.793 --> 12:01.344
and actually going
at the right day or time

12:01.379 --> 12:03.379
will be interesting.

12:03.413 --> 12:05.241
[Jo speaking Spanish]

12:10.931 --> 12:13.206
- I think.
- We're going to check in the phone.

12:13.241 --> 12:14.482
Okay. Thank you.

12:14.517 --> 12:15.655
Oh, god. I've got my mom

12:15.689 --> 12:19.379
coz if I didn't have
her, then I'd be screwed.

12:20.655 --> 12:22.275
[Jo] So we're here.

12:22.310 --> 12:24.413
Honduras is...

12:24.448 --> 12:26.655
Wait, I've not got
my glasses on. Here.

12:26.689 --> 12:30.068
[Narrator] 1,600
kilometers from Mexico City

12:30.103 --> 12:31.965
and the republic of Honduras,

12:32.000 --> 12:34.965
the first checkpoint,
copÃ¡n ruinas.

12:35.000 --> 12:39.482
Once the center of
ancient Mayan civilization,

12:39.517 --> 12:40.827
now a bustling town

12:40.862 --> 12:45.758
welcoming tourists drawn
to the archaeological ruins.

12:45.793 --> 12:49.206
[Man] Can you fly? [Jo] No.

12:49.241 --> 12:52.413
- We have to go by train or...
- [Sam] Donkey.

12:52.448 --> 12:54.482
Yes. You know, I know
we're going to Honduras

12:54.517 --> 12:56.586
and guys told us to get a Metro.

12:56.620 --> 12:59.586
Nine stops to the bus station
and ask at the bus station...

12:59.620 --> 13:01.482
[Both speaking Spanish]

13:01.517 --> 13:03.896
and then we'll go from there!

13:03.931 --> 13:05.103
Can we go by... [vocalizes]

13:05.137 --> 13:06.206
No. Bus. He's saying bus.

13:06.241 --> 13:08.172
No go train? Only bus, yeah?

13:08.206 --> 13:11.310
[Narrator] The most
direct route to copÃ¡n ruinas,

13:11.344 --> 13:15.137
head south to Mexico's
spectacular pacific coast.

13:15.172 --> 13:17.068
Then through Guatemala,

13:17.103 --> 13:21.310
where travel is cheap
but can be unpredictable.

13:21.344 --> 13:25.000
Or teams could be tempted by
the more reliable transport system

13:25.034 --> 13:28.413
around tourist hot spots in
the northern Caribbean coast

13:28.448 --> 13:31.275
and then down through
the tiny nation of Belize.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.896
Others may be drawn
to the cultural treasures

13:34.931 --> 13:36.965
of Mexico's central highlands,

13:37.000 --> 13:39.034
which has the benefit
of flexible routes

13:39.068 --> 13:42.172
for their final push
to the checkpoint.

13:43.931 --> 13:46.172
[Jen] Guatemala
might be more direct,

13:46.206 --> 13:48.896
but we really fancy
Belize, don't we?

13:48.931 --> 13:51.344
I think we've got a
bit of a route forming.

13:51.379 --> 13:54.344
I want to visit everywhere
coz I am so not well-traveled.

13:54.379 --> 13:56.379
We'd like to go to Tanzania.

13:56.413 --> 13:57.827
I'd really love to
go to Dubrovnik.

13:59.206 --> 14:00.827
- Belize?
- Yes!

14:00.862 --> 14:02.493
- Yes, that's on our list.
- Really fancy Belize.

14:02.517 --> 14:05.862
[Jen] Hola! Is there like
a main coach station?

14:05.896 --> 14:07.655
[Narrator] Jan and
Rob have discovered

14:07.689 --> 14:10.172
their best bus
connections to Belize...

14:10.206 --> 14:11.310
[Rob] Gracias, gracias.

14:11.344 --> 14:15.206
Can be found in
puebla, two hours away.

14:15.241 --> 14:18.655
[Rob] So, we could
get a Metro to puebla.

14:18.689 --> 14:21.827
[Jen] Fantastic. Our
plan is to get from sevilla,

14:21.862 --> 14:23.206
which is where we are now.

14:23.241 --> 14:25.758
We're on the way to puebla,

14:25.793 --> 14:28.758
and we're hoping that
there is a coach station.

14:30.655 --> 14:32.965
Do you think we're
in the wrong location?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.448
I'm not sure it's
the right place.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.620
[Rob] Let's give it a go.

14:37.655 --> 14:39.275
Do you know what
we're better doing?

14:41.379 --> 14:42.896
He's ignoring me.

14:42.931 --> 14:45.137
Robbie, I'm trying
to speak to you.

14:45.172 --> 14:49.448
I lost my hearing in
my left ear in childhood.

14:49.482 --> 14:51.275
And then, recently,

14:51.310 --> 14:54.482
I recently lost my
hearing in my "good" ear.

14:54.517 --> 14:57.793
Kinda knocked me
and Jen for six, really.

14:57.827 --> 15:00.241
Rather than in a fast train
that gets there in three hours.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.034
We're not getting
in a train though.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.137
Well, whatever we get.

15:04.172 --> 15:07.689
With the hearing aid
in I'll hear most sounds.

15:07.724 --> 15:10.655
I can't hear you very
well. It's really noisy.

15:10.689 --> 15:12.482
I think this journey's
gonna be challenging.

15:12.517 --> 15:14.413
It will challenge our
communication, won't it?

15:14.448 --> 15:15.862
Absolutely. Yep.

15:15.896 --> 15:18.137
We do struggle with
that. From time to time.

15:18.172 --> 15:19.172
All the time.

15:20.862 --> 15:22.355
[Rob] I don't know
how we're gonna know

15:22.379 --> 15:24.034
if it is the right,
pueblo or not.

15:24.724 --> 15:25.655
It's got the same name,

15:25.689 --> 15:27.551
so let's just, let's
just give that a go.

15:28.931 --> 15:30.551
[Narrator] Eager
to leave the city

15:30.586 --> 15:32.655
dom and Lizzie
have jumped in a taxi

15:32.689 --> 15:34.586
hundred and twenty-eight pesos?

15:35.827 --> 15:38.689
I mean, I didn't
know if it was five.

15:38.724 --> 15:42.275
[Dom] And we've got to
re-evaluate where we actually go.

15:42.310 --> 15:45.517
[Lizzie] Oh, we got a bus
right down by Guatemala.

15:45.551 --> 15:47.551
I don't know. I'm not
too keen on that idea.

15:47.586 --> 15:49.965
Yeah, I just feel like
I wanna get there.

15:52.379 --> 15:53.734
- That's all I'm saying.
- [Dom] I know.

15:53.758 --> 15:55.665
We want to get there, but
we need to enjoy some of this.

15:55.689 --> 15:57.310
I know, I know.

15:57.344 --> 15:59.827
That's what you're saying.
I'm just putting across my point.

15:59.862 --> 16:02.931
[Dom] Okay. You may change your
mind when you're sat in a coach for...

16:02.965 --> 16:04.689
- Yeah, exactly. So, yes.
- 30 hours.

16:04.724 --> 16:05.689
- Yeah.
- Okay then.

16:05.724 --> 16:07.103
[Speaks indistinctly]

16:09.827 --> 16:12.310
I think mom and dad's
biggest worry about the race

16:12.344 --> 16:13.896
is us two falling out.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.827
[Lizzie] Yeah. Having
fights and bickering.

16:15.862 --> 16:18.551
You never know, maybe
we'll mature a little bit.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.689
Mature in this
experience, maybe.

16:21.931 --> 16:23.310
I'm looking at that meter,

16:23.344 --> 16:25.586
and it is just going up and up.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.724
[Narrator] As the
siblings sit in traffic,

16:31.758 --> 16:33.103
across town...

16:33.137 --> 16:34.758
[Jen] Puebla. Puebla.

16:34.793 --> 16:38.241
[Narrator] ...Jen and Rob
exit puebla Metro station.

16:38.275 --> 16:40.896
Uh, autobus international?

16:41.827 --> 16:43.793
Uh, where?

16:43.827 --> 16:46.034
Around here somewhere.

16:46.068 --> 16:48.103
This is like... oh, my god.

16:48.137 --> 16:49.827
Where is the bloody station?

16:50.482 --> 16:52.275
[Rob] We're very lost.

16:52.310 --> 16:56.000
Says, "puebla is also well-connected
for those who continue to..."

16:56.034 --> 16:56.931
- Yeah.
- "...To the south."

16:56.965 --> 17:01.103
But puebla, it's another
state from Mexico.

17:01.137 --> 17:03.413
Here's uh, subway station.

17:03.448 --> 17:04.827
[Crying]

17:04.862 --> 17:06.965
- So different places?
- Yeah.

17:07.344 --> 17:08.206
Ah.

17:08.241 --> 17:10.482
Now, if you go to puebla...

17:10.517 --> 17:11.655
- [Rob] Si.
- [Jen] Yeah.

17:11.689 --> 17:14.172
I can help you to
go to the station.

17:14.206 --> 17:15.286
- For me it's okay.
- That's kind.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.700
-Okay.
-That's kind. Well, let me let me.

17:16.724 --> 17:17.724
- Let me...
- Oh, yes.

17:17.758 --> 17:20.482
- Let me call my wife.
- [Both laugh]

17:20.517 --> 17:21.527
[Narrator] While Jen and Rob

17:21.551 --> 17:23.275
restart their
journey to Belize...

17:23.310 --> 17:24.965
See you. Nice to meet you guys.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
- Thank you. You're an angel.
- Bye-bye.

17:27.034 --> 17:29.517
[Narrator] ...By heading
to the correct puebla...

17:29.551 --> 17:31.965
- Oh, my goodness, a four seasons.
- We're going down.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.286
[Shuntelle] That's
where I want to go.

17:33.310 --> 17:34.793
[Narrator] Michael and shuntelle

17:34.827 --> 17:37.206
have already sorted
a different route.

17:37.241 --> 17:39.586
[Shuntelle] Going to the Gulf
of Mexico by the Caribbean.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.148
[Michael] That's a home
from home. [Laughs]

17:41.172 --> 17:44.586
So it's always good to go
back towards that way anyway.

17:44.620 --> 17:48.241
[Narrator] They've booked a
grilling 22-hour bus journey to Merida,

17:48.275 --> 17:51.724
taking the tourist trail
along the Gulf of Mexico.

17:51.758 --> 17:55.793
And from there, into
a race south to Belize.

17:55.827 --> 17:58.965
It's just fantastic. This
whole thing's great.

17:59.000 --> 18:02.034
I don't need a luxury five
star hotel to enjoy something.

18:02.068 --> 18:05.310
This is the experience, the
adventure that we were looking for.

18:05.344 --> 18:06.551
At least I was, anyway.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.034
[Crowd laughs]

18:08.965 --> 18:11.000
I don't take buses. So...

18:11.034 --> 18:13.344
Probably haven't done a bus
in about ten years.[Laughs]

18:13.379 --> 18:15.299
I thought that's what we
were gonna be coming in.

18:16.241 --> 18:18.379
For 22 hours.

18:18.413 --> 18:21.413
[Narrator] Having spent almost
one percent of their entire budget

18:21.448 --> 18:23.137
to travel just six miles...

18:23.172 --> 18:24.551
[Speaking Spanish]

18:24.586 --> 18:27.103
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie have
finally reached a bus terminal.

18:27.137 --> 18:28.344
- Hola.erm.
- [Woman] Hola.

18:28.379 --> 18:31.758
Can we get a bus
to oaxaca tonight?

18:31.793 --> 18:33.172
[Narrator] Aiming to head south,

18:33.206 --> 18:35.137
towards Mexico's
pacific coast...

18:37.206 --> 18:39.482
- Okay, that's worth it.
- [Lizzie laughs]

18:39.517 --> 18:41.551
That's worth the 200 pesos.

18:42.724 --> 18:44.620
What's this mode
of transport here?

18:44.655 --> 18:47.137
- [Jamiul laughs] - Good
luck getting us to copan ruinas.

18:47.172 --> 18:49.896
[Narrator] Still to settle on
a plan, emon and jamiul...

18:49.931 --> 18:51.562
[Emon] We need to figure
out where we're going.

18:51.586 --> 18:52.803
[Jamiul] Should we ask someone?

18:52.827 --> 18:54.793
I've always been
a keen adventurer.

18:54.827 --> 18:57.172
I've spent three
months traveling Africa.

18:57.206 --> 19:00.896
I've climbed Everest,
Kilimanjaro, mont blanc.

19:00.931 --> 19:02.103
To be honest with you,

19:02.137 --> 19:04.517
mount Everest is not as
tough as people make out.

19:04.551 --> 19:06.965
In which direction
should we start heading?

19:07.000 --> 19:09.344
Well, I know the
ruins of palenque are

19:09.379 --> 19:12.344
obviously something that I wanna
go see without a doubt, right?

19:12.379 --> 19:14.620
The Mayan architecture
is beautiful, man.

19:14.655 --> 19:18.827
[Narrator] Jamiul wants to head to the
world-famous Mayan ruins at palenque,

19:18.862 --> 19:22.241
780 kilometers away,
through central Mexico.

19:23.275 --> 19:24.413
It's fine.

19:24.448 --> 19:25.827
We'll settle in palenque.

19:25.862 --> 19:28.172
But we need to find out
how far it is in distance

19:28.206 --> 19:30.172
- and how far the bus trip is.
- Okay.

19:30.206 --> 19:32.251
- 'Cause we're still pushed for time right now.
- Yeah, we are.

19:32.275 --> 19:33.655
[Emon] I like to have his input.

19:33.689 --> 19:36.482
But it will be my
decision ultimately.

19:36.517 --> 19:38.448
At the end of the
day, I'm still his uncle.

19:38.482 --> 19:40.103
I think the route
that we've decided on

19:40.137 --> 19:41.862
is right up jamiul's street.

19:41.896 --> 19:45.068
This is for him.
This is for the kid.

19:45.965 --> 19:47.275
[Jen] We're really stupid.

19:47.310 --> 19:49.793
[Rob] We went to a
place with the same name.

19:49.827 --> 19:51.620
Today was always going
to be the hardest day.

19:51.655 --> 19:53.965
- Do you think?
- Yeah, getting into it.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.769
- Yeah, I guess.
- Right, this will become natural.

19:55.793 --> 19:57.793
-At some point -i hope so, yeah.

19:57.827 --> 19:58.827
In two months' time.

19:59.862 --> 20:01.862
[Jo] Maybe we just get
the first bus out of here

20:01.896 --> 20:03.862
that goes still further
towards Belize.

20:03.896 --> 20:05.482
[Sam] Yeah. Half
an hour to there.

20:05.517 --> 20:08.241
I'm getting stressed out just
trying to think of where to go.

20:10.103 --> 20:12.482
[Narrator] As day 1
comes to an end...

20:12.517 --> 20:14.896
[Michael] This is a hard
core way of traveling.

20:14.931 --> 20:16.517
Twenty-two hours on a coach.

20:16.551 --> 20:20.344
[Narrator] ...The last
teams escape Mexico City.

20:20.379 --> 20:22.862
-I'm so tired. I only want to sleep.
-You look stressed.

20:22.896 --> 20:24.655
You really do.

20:24.689 --> 20:25.769
[Sam] It's the most thinking

20:25.793 --> 20:27.033
I've ever had to do in my life.

20:31.724 --> 20:33.000
- [Lizzie] Dom?
- [Dom] What?

20:33.034 --> 20:34.413
[Lizzie] Look out the window.

20:34.448 --> 20:36.113
I didn't realize it looked
like that last night.

20:36.137 --> 20:38.586
[Dom] Ooh. That's
a nice vice, that.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.379
- Around the corner here, I think.
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.137
- Ah. There.
- [Both chuckle]

20:52.103 --> 20:54.137
[Narrator] After spending
the night at oaxaca,

20:54.172 --> 20:56.103
dom and Lizzie
are looking for a bus

20:56.137 --> 20:58.517
to speed them to the
border with Guatemala.

20:59.931 --> 21:01.551
- So...
- [Grunts]

21:01.586 --> 21:03.758
The only bus is at 7:00 tonight.

21:03.793 --> 21:06.482
- That's not ideal.
- No.

21:06.517 --> 21:08.838
[Lizzie] If we left tonight, what
time would we get to tapachula?

21:08.862 --> 21:12.448
Uh, 3:00 in the
afternoon the next day.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.896
[Lizzie] I think when we get
to Guatemala, we just gotta go.

21:14.931 --> 21:16.620
Yeah, let's get the tickets

21:16.655 --> 21:18.310
- and enjoy the day in oaxaca.
- Yeah.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.862
- Yeah? Okay, come on them.
- Yeah.

21:22.724 --> 21:24.758
[Narrator] The
conquistadors first came here

21:24.793 --> 21:26.793
in the search for aztec gold.

21:29.103 --> 21:31.068
[Speaking Spanish]

21:36.137 --> 21:39.000
[Narrator] Sitting 90 meters
above the oaxaca valley

21:41.379 --> 21:45.586
hierve El agua mineral Springs
form a natural infinity pool.

21:48.896 --> 21:51.000
- [Lizzie] Ready for a dip?
- [Dom] Absolutely.

21:53.482 --> 21:55.310
[Narrator] As they
run down the rock face

21:55.344 --> 21:58.793
the waters, saturated
with calcium carbonate,

21:58.827 --> 22:00.896
create large stalactites.

22:02.689 --> 22:03.689
Oh.

22:04.551 --> 22:05.827
The pasty bum's out.

22:05.862 --> 22:07.931
- [Lizzie] Oh, my god.
- Oh. Ah.

22:08.827 --> 22:09.827
Fini.

22:11.793 --> 22:13.137
I'm gonna jump in.

22:13.172 --> 22:15.572
- [Lizzie] Please don't do that, dom.
- [Dom] I'm gonna do it.

22:18.827 --> 22:20.113
- Oh!
- [Lizzie] Did you touch the bottom?

22:20.137 --> 22:21.137
No.

22:23.241 --> 22:25.241
I don't think I've
ever seen anything

22:25.275 --> 22:27.862
as beautiful is that
in my entire life.

22:27.896 --> 22:30.758
I think we're quite fortunate
that we couldn't get a bus.

22:30.793 --> 22:32.724
I'd be absolutely gutted
if I knew I'd miss this.

22:32.758 --> 22:36.103
Exactly. Like, we could've
easily just gone straight past this

22:36.137 --> 22:37.551
[laughs]

22:37.586 --> 22:39.275
[Dom] I've got a much
better understanding

22:39.310 --> 22:40.907
- of what this race is about.
- [Lizzie] Yeah.

22:40.931 --> 22:42.379
We want to win,

22:42.413 --> 22:44.551
but we don't miss out
on moments like this.

22:44.586 --> 22:46.551
How far are those?

22:46.586 --> 22:49.655
- It's just...
- [Dom] Ridiculous, isn't it?

22:49.689 --> 22:51.965
[Lizzie] We're both
gonna Cherish this.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.482
[Dom] Mum and dad will be happy.

22:53.517 --> 22:55.275
Especially us two
doing it together.

22:55.310 --> 22:58.103
- I think that's what they've always really wanted.
- Yeah.

22:58.137 --> 23:00.310
- And we're not at each other's throats either.
- No.

23:07.793 --> 23:09.413
[Emon] Doing this overnight bus,

23:09.448 --> 23:11.931
I personally think we're
way ahead of everybody else.

23:11.965 --> 23:13.245
But as soon as
we get a palenque,

23:13.275 --> 23:15.517
I say we give the teams a
chance to catch up to us.

23:15.551 --> 23:17.551
- Yeah. [Laughs]
- Make the race interesting.

23:17.586 --> 23:18.827
[Jamiul] Of course.

23:18.862 --> 23:21.103
I'm looking forward to
seeing the ruins, man.

23:21.137 --> 23:23.517
[Narrator] Emon and jamiul
still have their sights set

23:23.551 --> 23:26.379
on the Mayan ruins of palenque,

23:26.413 --> 23:28.896
but on an overnight
bus, to tonala.

23:32.482 --> 23:34.242
I'm just wondering if
you could help us, man.

23:34.275 --> 23:36.482
I mean, we're gonna
be going to tonala.

23:36.517 --> 23:39.655
And from tonala we
wanna get to palenque.

23:39.689 --> 23:41.448
Yeah, but that's up north.

23:41.482 --> 23:43.827
[Jamiul] That is up north.

23:43.862 --> 23:48.551
In terms of, like, miles
or kilometers of time.

23:48.586 --> 23:50.310
[Jamiul] Oh. It's
about six hours.

23:50.344 --> 23:51.976
- [Emon] Six hours?
- [Man] Six to eight hours.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.586
[Clicks tongue] Oh. Things that
we should've checked out, yeah?

23:55.724 --> 23:57.068
[Narrator] A comfort break...

23:57.103 --> 23:59.206
[Jamiul] You can't get
from tonala to palenque.

23:59.241 --> 24:00.827
[Narrator] ...And a rethink.

24:00.862 --> 24:03.517
If we wanna get to palenque,
we have to go from here.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.517
Let's go and get
our stuff. Come on.

24:05.551 --> 24:06.931
- Okay.
- [Jamiul] I'll get it.

24:08.103 --> 24:10.517
[Emon] Obviously, our plans
somewhat changed a bit.

24:11.172 --> 24:12.655
Ah!

24:12.689 --> 24:14.769
[Emon] Obviously I thought that we
were way ahead of everybody else.

24:14.793 --> 24:16.551
Let's just get to
palenque, and then...

24:16.586 --> 24:19.103
Uh, once we're in palenque,
we'll enjoy our time in palenque

24:19.137 --> 24:21.137
and then, we'll
take it from there.

24:21.172 --> 24:23.034
- [Jamiul] All right. Cool.
- [Emon] Yeah?

24:23.068 --> 24:27.068
[Narrator] Another bus
and another 600 pesos.

24:27.103 --> 24:29.965
[Jamiul] I'm assuming that is the
best decision that we made so far.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.448
But, uh, first class
buses aren't cheap.

24:33.482 --> 24:35.172
Right, this is gonna
last us two months.

24:36.655 --> 24:37.896
All of this/

24:37.931 --> 24:39.941
[jamiul] I feel like we spent
quite a bit of our budget.

24:39.965 --> 24:41.448
It's quite frustrating,
to be honest.

24:44.620 --> 24:47.620
[Narrator] Sixty kilometers
closer to the border,

24:47.655 --> 24:48.655
Jo and Sam.

24:50.137 --> 24:53.103
[Jo] Hola. We need
to go to Guatemala.

24:53.137 --> 24:54.379
[Man] This is the time.

24:54.413 --> 24:58.827
It leaves at, um, 5:40
and it arrives at 9:35.

24:58.862 --> 25:00.206
Oh, 9:35.

25:00.241 --> 25:01.793
- [Man speaks Spanish]
- [Jo] Si.

25:03.241 --> 25:06.551
Perfect. That gives us the
afternoon to explore the city.

25:06.586 --> 25:08.103
- Yeah. Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

25:08.137 --> 25:10.137
[Narrator] With
six hours to kill...

25:10.172 --> 25:13.103
- [Jo] Do you got your camera?
- [Sam] Yeah.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.137
[Narrator] ...An opportunity
to grab some time off the bus.

25:16.172 --> 25:18.344
Look at these buildings.
Aren't they stunning?

25:18.379 --> 25:20.079
[Narrator] With its narrow
cobblestoned streets

25:20.103 --> 25:22.206
and colorful painted facades...

25:22.965 --> 25:23.896
[Sam] Do you see that?

25:23.931 --> 25:25.965
[Narrator] San
Cristobal De las casas

25:26.000 --> 25:28.413
was colonial town
frozen in time.

25:28.448 --> 25:29.655
[Sam] That is amazing.

25:31.586 --> 25:34.379
I want to go and
travel the world,

25:34.413 --> 25:36.068
not just a couple of places.

25:36.103 --> 25:38.310
I mean, like, go
everywhere you can.

25:38.344 --> 25:40.068
You see absolutely everything.

25:40.103 --> 25:41.724
Different ways of life.

25:41.758 --> 25:44.793
Different food, smells, tastes.

25:44.827 --> 25:47.275
[Jo] Can we go in your car?

25:47.310 --> 25:49.103
[Sam] Hoping I'll
be eating street food.

25:49.137 --> 25:51.689
Not, like, road
kill, but street food,

25:54.655 --> 25:56.379
meet you at the top.

25:56.413 --> 25:58.620
- [Sam] I'll race you.
- [Jo] Okay.

25:58.655 --> 25:59.896
[Narrator] Overlooking the town

25:59.931 --> 26:01.827
is the cerro San Cristobal...

26:01.862 --> 26:03.896
- [Sam] Come on. Come on.
- [Jo] I'm not giving in.

26:03.931 --> 26:05.862
[Narrator] ...A hill
crowned by a church

26:05.896 --> 26:08.206
offering stunning views...

26:08.241 --> 26:10.137
[Jo] Think you're
first at the top.

26:10.172 --> 26:15.275
[Narrator] Only accessible
by claiming its 436 steps.

26:15.310 --> 26:16.965
- [Sam] Halfway up.
- [Jo panting]

26:18.310 --> 26:20.137
[Jo] I might just stop
here for a rest, son.

26:20.172 --> 26:22.758
[Sam] Okay, I'm
gonna take pictures.

26:22.793 --> 26:25.068
[Jo] I'm the oldest
competitor in the race.

26:25.103 --> 26:27.965
Hopefully, I will
still be a contender.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.413
Just need the odd break
when climbing stairs.

26:32.206 --> 26:33.172
[Sam] Beautiful.

26:33.206 --> 26:35.000
[Jo] Last time I did
a lot of traveling,

26:35.034 --> 26:36.931
went trekking in Nepal,

26:36.965 --> 26:40.206
had my 25th birthday in India.

26:40.241 --> 26:44.172
And I'll be having my
55th birthday on this trip.

26:44.206 --> 26:46.517
So I'm getting back in
the saddle, as it were.

26:47.241 --> 26:48.586
[Sam] How are your bloods?

26:48.620 --> 26:49.631
[Jo] They're dropping a bit.

26:49.655 --> 26:51.448
I just, I'll start my Insulin.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.482
So I've had type 1
diabetes since I was 12.

26:56.517 --> 26:58.896
And generally, you
know, I've been okay.

26:58.931 --> 27:01.206
But I just have to
keep an eye on things.

27:01.241 --> 27:03.551
And this this monitor
is my blood sugar,

27:03.586 --> 27:05.172
which is sort of attached to me.

27:05.206 --> 27:08.965
I hope I won't slow Sam down
and affect his trip adversely.

27:11.068 --> 27:12.827
Onwards and upwards.

27:12.862 --> 27:14.586
[Sam grunts] You ready, mum?

27:14.620 --> 27:17.137
- Yeah. Yeah, let's go.
- Let's get to the top.

27:17.172 --> 27:20.034
- Okay. Great.
- Let's go.

27:20.068 --> 27:22.827
Of course I'm gonna
keep an eye on my mum

27:22.862 --> 27:24.275
because I can't not, can I?

27:24.310 --> 27:26.068
She's the most
important person to me

27:26.103 --> 27:28.793
and I wouldn't want
anything bad to happen to her.

27:28.827 --> 27:30.758
Well, she's like the
strongest woman I ever met.

27:30.793 --> 27:33.068
Like, she just carries
on. No matter what.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.000
- Hey, we made it.
- Well, we made it.

27:37.862 --> 27:39.413
- Whoa.
- [Jo] Oh, wow.

27:40.655 --> 27:42.137
This is what we signed up for.

27:42.172 --> 27:44.068
I'm so glad I'm doing
this with you, love.

27:44.103 --> 27:46.241
Couldn't do it with
anyone better, to be honest.

27:46.275 --> 27:47.793
[Jo] Oh.

27:47.827 --> 27:49.758
And this is just the start.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.068
- [Sam] Day 2.
- [Jo] Yeah.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.896
- [Sam] Day 2.
- [Jo] I know. Amazing.

27:56.310 --> 27:58.000
[Bird cawing]

27:58.034 --> 27:59.655
[Snoring]

28:00.517 --> 28:02.172
[Laughing]

28:02.206 --> 28:04.965
Very tired. That's what
22 hours does to you.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.034
[Laughs]

28:07.068 --> 28:09.034
[Continues snoring]

28:09.068 --> 28:09.965
[Narrator] To the north,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.034
taking a costal route to Belize.

28:12.068 --> 28:15.586
Michael and shuntelle
have reached Merida,

28:15.620 --> 28:18.241
situated in the crater
formed by an asteroid

28:18.275 --> 28:21.034
that struck 66
million years ago,

28:21.068 --> 28:23.517
hastening the extinction
of the dinosaurs.

28:23.551 --> 28:26.206
[Shuntelle] Uh, may
we have, uh, two tickets

28:26.241 --> 28:28.827
from, uh, Merida to tulum.

28:28.862 --> 28:32.310
I don't even think that my mind is
functioning properly at the moment.

28:32.344 --> 28:35.103
Um, wanna get to tulum today.

28:35.137 --> 28:36.793
Didn't realize how
long it would take.

28:36.827 --> 28:39.551
We've done over
22 hours on a bus

28:39.586 --> 28:42.034
and then we're
back on another bus.

28:42.068 --> 28:45.758
Fingers crossed we end up in a
motel at some point this evening.

28:46.620 --> 28:47.940
[Michael] I'd
rather be doing this

28:47.965 --> 28:50.620
than going to Barbados
or Jamaica right now.

28:50.655 --> 28:51.586
I would.

28:51.620 --> 28:53.113
I'm just grateful for
the whole experience.

28:53.137 --> 28:55.896
- I don't really care...
- i find this more like cattle class.

28:55.931 --> 28:58.103
Michael and I are
very, very different.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.448
I think if you could
sleep outdoors, he would.

29:00.482 --> 29:01.758
This is quite useful.

29:01.793 --> 29:03.793
We used to use these
type of things in the military.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.379
That's very handy.

29:05.413 --> 29:07.275
You know, I joined the
military when I was 16.

29:07.310 --> 29:08.931
So, you see a lot of things.

29:08.965 --> 29:13.172
Like adventure, adventure
training, different countries.

29:13.206 --> 29:17.275
I could live off the contents within my
pockets of my, of my jacket if I had to.

29:17.310 --> 29:19.827
Those in the military.
Know what I'm talking about.

29:19.862 --> 29:22.275
We can survive in
any, in all terrains

29:22.310 --> 29:24.172
and get on with it, yeah.

29:24.206 --> 29:28.206
He literally has
moments of craziness.

29:28.241 --> 29:30.413
Emergency whistle, just in case.

29:30.448 --> 29:32.965
Shuntelle gets lost,
I'll be able to find her.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.965
"Oh, babe, I've bought a
motor home." You've done what?

29:36.000 --> 29:38.034
[Michael] Yeah, so this
is my, my baby, really.

29:39.137 --> 29:40.896
[Sighs] You coming in?

29:40.931 --> 29:44.137
Yeah, so this is
it inside. I love it.

29:44.172 --> 29:48.551
The plan is to travel
as much as I can do

29:48.586 --> 29:51.172
with shuntelle around
the countryside.

29:51.206 --> 29:52.344
You know?

29:52.379 --> 29:54.527
We definitely had our ups
and downs in the relationship.

29:54.551 --> 29:55.655
We don't live together.

29:55.689 --> 29:58.620
But we have talked about
moving in together and...

29:58.655 --> 30:01.586
So there is a
conversation we have had.

30:01.620 --> 30:04.275
So this is quite a
risk we're taking.

30:04.310 --> 30:07.000
I hope that even when
we do hit challenges,

30:07.034 --> 30:08.793
we're able to work
with each other

30:08.827 --> 30:10.275
rather than against each other.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.689
We'll see.

30:11.724 --> 30:14.655
If we find accommodation or
find somewhere to sleep tonight...

30:14.689 --> 30:16.724
[Michael] Why will
we be doing that?

30:16.758 --> 30:19.103
Say it. Go on. Say it.

30:19.137 --> 30:21.379
- I don't wanna say it.
- Say it.

30:21.413 --> 30:24.137
- Camp. [Groans]
- [Laughing]

30:24.172 --> 30:26.655
You know, you can give me
one day. Straight into camping.

30:26.689 --> 30:27.689
Oh, help me.

30:30.344 --> 30:32.206
[Sam] Oh, god, I'm hungry.

30:32.241 --> 30:33.448
[Jo] What fancies you?

30:34.137 --> 30:35.172
[Sam] Full English?

30:35.206 --> 30:37.620
[Jo laughing] No. Mexican.

30:37.655 --> 30:40.034
[Narrator] Back in San
Cristobal De las casas...

30:40.068 --> 30:41.355
[Sam] I don't think
it's very Mexican,

30:41.379 --> 30:44.758
but I might have pasta
bolognese and parmesan cheese.

30:44.793 --> 30:46.413
[Laughs]

30:46.448 --> 30:48.379
- A bit... yeah.
- [Man speaks]

30:48.413 --> 30:49.872
- Uh, Manchester, england.
- Manchester.

30:49.896 --> 30:50.827
- What country?
- [Jo] Yeah.

30:50.862 --> 30:51.724
[Sam] Manchester.

30:51.758 --> 30:53.448
[Narrator] A chance encounter...

30:53.482 --> 30:55.103
[Man] Where are you going?

30:55.137 --> 30:57.700
-[Jo] Well, we don't know. We're trying to get to Belize.
-Thank you very much.

30:57.724 --> 31:00.068
[Jo] We just need
to go fast, you see.

31:00.103 --> 31:01.827
[Narrator] And a change of plan

31:01.862 --> 31:02.862
[Jo] Can you...

31:02.896 --> 31:05.206
So I can recommend
you to take this other road.

31:05.241 --> 31:08.000
- It's quicker than to take on this.
- [Jo] Okay.

31:08.034 --> 31:10.862
[Jo] We thought we were going to
have to go Belize and then Honduras.

31:10.896 --> 31:13.586
And they told us you can go
just straight through Guatemala

31:13.620 --> 31:14.758
to the checkpoint.

31:14.793 --> 31:17.310
And they've given us the
route that we're best to take.

31:17.344 --> 31:19.068
I'm feeling like a
backpacker again,

31:19.103 --> 31:22.000
and it's great to be able
to interact with people.

31:22.034 --> 31:24.758
You can rely on the
kindness of strangers

31:24.793 --> 31:25.724
- because...
- Yeah.

31:25.758 --> 31:28.379
When you do, they
are there to help.

31:28.413 --> 31:30.413
- Really, really...
- Way more friendly than brits.

31:33.827 --> 31:37.000
[Jen] We get off
this in, like, an hour.

31:37.034 --> 31:39.379
We kind of need a
bit of a plan, I reckon.

31:39.413 --> 31:41.586
There's this place offering jobs

31:41.620 --> 31:43.758
at the border crossing.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.482
[Narrator] To
make it to ushuaia,

31:45.517 --> 31:48.551
the teams will need to
work to earn extra cash

31:48.586 --> 31:49.655
and have been provided

31:49.689 --> 31:52.724
with a directory of
local job opportunities.

31:52.758 --> 31:56.862
- But if we can negotiate better board...
- Better board. Yeah.

31:56.896 --> 31:58.413
- Then we're winning.
- [Rob] Yes.

31:58.448 --> 32:01.379
[Jen] And we actually get
a ride across the border.

32:01.965 --> 32:03.586
Woo-hoo.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.344
- We're making good progress, I think.
- Do you think?

32:06.379 --> 32:08.517
[Narrator] Having
motored across country,

32:08.551 --> 32:09.724
Jen and Rob arrive

32:09.758 --> 32:12.482
at the border town
of frontera corozal

32:12.517 --> 32:15.620
situated on the bank
of the usumacinta river

32:15.655 --> 32:18.724
with Guatemala a stone's
throw across the water.

32:20.827 --> 32:22.310
[Grunts]

32:22.344 --> 32:27.241
You, you show us how to,
what you want doing, a boat.

32:27.275 --> 32:30.068
Si? uh, for, for free.

32:30.103 --> 32:31.586
- If we work. Si?
- Oh, gosh.

32:31.620 --> 32:34.172
[Rob] Oh, muchas
gracias. Muchas gracias.

32:34.206 --> 32:36.448
[Jen] Are you comfortable
that you know what's going on?

32:36.482 --> 32:37.769
[Rob] We're doing
half day's work.

32:37.793 --> 32:39.758
We're getting free board.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.517
- [Jen] Yeah.
- [Rob] And a free canoe ride

32:42.551 --> 32:44.182
- to the border.
- [Jen] Tomorrow, at 7:00 A.M.

32:44.206 --> 32:47.172
[Narrator] All that no stands
between them and Guatemala

32:47.206 --> 32:48.827
is 50 meters of water

32:49.896 --> 32:52.517
on a mountain of
the hotel's laundry.

32:52.551 --> 32:54.620
[Woman speaking Spanish]

32:54.655 --> 32:56.896
Okay. Always fold inside.

32:56.931 --> 32:58.827
- Okay.
- [Rob] Ah.

32:58.862 --> 33:00.896
[Jen] Oh, it's sticky,
like high washing life.

33:01.655 --> 33:02.655
Okay.

33:04.448 --> 33:06.344
[Jen] How many
washes have you done

33:06.379 --> 33:08.068
since we've lived
together, Robbie?

33:08.103 --> 33:11.137
- Uh...
- You could count it on a person's hand

33:11.172 --> 33:14.241
who'd lost all their
fingers in a severe...

33:14.275 --> 33:16.000
Uh, again, I get...

33:16.034 --> 33:19.103
That's not...
mal.Bad. Mal.Again.

33:19.137 --> 33:22.413
[Narrator] Two years ago, Jen
and Rob's lives changed forever.

33:23.862 --> 33:25.000
[Blows whistle]

33:25.034 --> 33:27.206
If you hear that, it
means danger, danger.

33:28.241 --> 33:29.665
Can you hear that?
Can you actually hear?

33:29.689 --> 33:31.034
- I can. Now you...
- Oh, you can

33:31.068 --> 33:33.562
now that you stood right next to
me and knocked on my hearing aid.

33:33.586 --> 33:35.241
[Narrator] Following
a routine operation

33:35.275 --> 33:37.586
to remove a growth
in Rob's inner ear,

33:37.620 --> 33:41.517
doctors discovered the damage
was worse than first feared.

33:41.551 --> 33:43.827
So I'm completely
deaf in this ear.

33:43.862 --> 33:46.586
Um, got little bit of
hearing in this ear.

33:46.620 --> 33:48.275
This is my hearing aids.

33:48.310 --> 33:50.448
With this, I can
hear most sounds.

33:50.482 --> 33:53.724
Quality's not amazing.

33:53.758 --> 33:55.838
[Jen] We don't really kind of
socialize in groups anymore

33:55.862 --> 33:57.803
'cause it's a lot of effort to
kind of read people's lips.

33:57.827 --> 34:00.103
And when so many people
in the group are chatting,

34:00.137 --> 34:02.689
I see, yeah, his confidence
is definitely decreased.

34:02.724 --> 34:05.068
He likes to spend a
lot of time on his own.

34:05.103 --> 34:06.758
Right, communication
is key, isn't it?

34:06.793 --> 34:10.137
And... you're not the same
person after it's happened I guess.

34:10.172 --> 34:14.103
And you worry
whether your partner

34:14.137 --> 34:16.931
still feels the same
way about you after that.

34:16.965 --> 34:20.931
Because you're not the same
person that they knew and loved.

34:22.344 --> 34:23.344
But yeah.

34:25.517 --> 34:27.931
Okay. What are we
painting the tree with?

34:27.965 --> 34:29.241
- Okay.
- Oh, with paint.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.413
- Like here, down.
- Up to there.

34:31.448 --> 34:33.068
I've never done
this before in my life.

34:33.103 --> 34:35.241
This is a little bit fun.

34:35.275 --> 34:38.344
I just want to, like, reconnect.

34:38.379 --> 34:41.413
And I just really can't wait to
see you in this environment.

34:41.448 --> 34:44.034
Just having fun and just yeah,

34:44.068 --> 34:46.275
being you rather
than kind of deaf Rob.

34:46.724 --> 34:47.724
Mmm. Okay.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.172
It's not an instruction.
Okay, I will do that.

34:51.206 --> 34:52.827
Yes, yes.

34:52.862 --> 34:56.172
I just want to see him,
like, giggle and laugh,

34:56.206 --> 34:57.344
and god, I would just like

34:57.379 --> 34:58.793
to say to Robbie that, um...

35:00.724 --> 35:01.724
That I'm there.

35:02.793 --> 35:04.103
Like the old Robbie,

35:05.482 --> 35:06.655
because, like, it's...

35:07.344 --> 35:08.931
Oh, it's so sad. Um...

35:10.310 --> 35:11.310
It's just different.

35:15.137 --> 35:17.793
I think it was down to you that
we overcame the language thing.

35:17.827 --> 35:18.965
Well, we're both adults.

35:19.931 --> 35:21.000
[Robbie laughs] Yeah.

35:22.310 --> 35:23.206
That was good.

35:23.241 --> 35:25.103
How did the demonstrate work?

35:25.137 --> 35:27.172
You're really getting more
expressive. I love that.

35:29.379 --> 35:30.379
Yeah, it was fun.

35:41.655 --> 35:43.862
Just stay there just one minute.

35:43.896 --> 35:46.724
I just want to remember
you in this view.

35:46.758 --> 35:48.206
That is such a nice picture.

35:49.034 --> 35:50.034
Oh, Robbie.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.758
We're hoping to get a
ride over to Guatemala.

35:55.344 --> 35:56.379
Good morning.

35:57.241 --> 35:58.689
Boat.

35:59.551 --> 36:00.827
- Free ticket.
- Free ticket.

36:00.862 --> 36:02.034
- Si.
- Si.

36:03.551 --> 36:05.724
Oh, we just go.
You come with us.

36:05.758 --> 36:07.689
Great. I think
what he's saying is

36:07.724 --> 36:10.103
um, because we
worked last night,

36:10.137 --> 36:12.655
he now knows that we
can have a free ticket.

36:12.689 --> 36:13.689
Adios.

36:13.931 --> 36:14.931
What?

36:16.241 --> 36:18.068
Oh, no. We got to
do more work now?

36:18.517 --> 36:19.586
Really?

36:19.620 --> 36:21.793
Oh, my god, Robbie.
Is this even true?

36:23.241 --> 36:25.206
I have confidence that
this trip's gonna break me.

36:26.137 --> 36:27.137
Should we just pay?

36:27.896 --> 36:28.965
No, we're not paying.

36:29.758 --> 36:31.172
There's no way in hell like...

36:31.206 --> 36:32.586
Oh, oh.

36:33.827 --> 36:36.275
Oh, Robbie.

36:36.310 --> 36:39.071
So I thought because we did all
the work yesterday, we got a free ride.

36:39.758 --> 36:40.965
But that's not what happened.

36:41.241 --> 36:42.620
Um.

36:42.655 --> 36:44.103
So now we're doing more work.

36:44.137 --> 36:46.034
What was I expecting
to be doing though?

36:47.034 --> 36:48.034
Let's just crack on.

36:49.586 --> 36:51.551
We just kind of hope that

36:51.586 --> 36:54.310
we're nearer to the
border than everybody else.

36:54.344 --> 36:57.379
While Jen and Rob
struggle to pay the ferryman...

36:57.413 --> 36:59.034
- This is the bottom of it.
- Yeah, look.

36:59.068 --> 37:01.586
It says "welcome to Guatemala."

37:01.620 --> 37:05.000
Joe and Sam are the
first team to leave Mexico.

37:05.896 --> 37:07.448
Muchos gracias.

37:07.482 --> 37:09.827
After a long and
bloody civil war,

37:09.862 --> 37:11.965
today, Guatemala is becoming

37:12.000 --> 37:14.034
an economic
success in the region

37:14.068 --> 37:17.068
as a major exporter
of coffee and chocolate,

37:17.103 --> 37:18.758
the food of the Mayan gods.

37:20.551 --> 37:21.655
God, it's hot today.

37:21.689 --> 37:25.275
Sam, however, worships
some more savory deity.

37:25.310 --> 37:28.137
Hello, can I get a
packet of cheetos?

37:28.172 --> 37:31.137
Si. Si.I just spoke Spanish.

37:31.172 --> 37:34.000
I'm happy. I managed to get
what I wanted for the first time.

37:35.344 --> 37:36.758
Get in there. Get in there.

37:37.241 --> 37:38.241
Gracias.

37:41.689 --> 37:44.827
I can't wait to see some,
uh, Maya architecture.

37:44.862 --> 37:47.206
Stopping just
short of the border,

37:47.241 --> 37:49.793
emon and jamiul have
reached palenque.

37:53.931 --> 37:56.862
The westernmost city
of the Mayan civilization

37:56.896 --> 37:59.241
reached its peak in
the seventh century

37:59.275 --> 38:01.310
under the rule of
pakal the great.

38:02.413 --> 38:03.793
I think we can
go inside that one.

38:03.827 --> 38:04.827
Can we go inside here?

38:06.068 --> 38:09.241
He was buried along
with human sacrifices

38:09.275 --> 38:11.000
in the temple of inscriptions.

38:12.586 --> 38:15.000
I think it was a tomb, innit?

38:15.034 --> 38:18.275
After its decline, the city
was absorbed into the jungle.

38:20.655 --> 38:23.413
And over a thousand
structures remain unexplored.

38:25.206 --> 38:27.620
I've been studying architecture
for the past seven years,

38:27.655 --> 38:31.482
so to come to historical
archaeological sites like this,

38:31.517 --> 38:32.793
it gives you this understanding

38:32.827 --> 38:35.482
of how people back
in the day sort of lived.

38:36.655 --> 38:39.172
I'm definitely looking to
always expand my knowledge

38:39.206 --> 38:40.310
on what's out there.

38:41.103 --> 38:42.724
Want to feel it on...

38:42.758 --> 38:44.038
Want to feel it
in my fingertips.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.344
The reason I came
here was for him.

38:47.379 --> 38:49.724
I've been fortunate I've had
this experience in my life.

38:50.586 --> 38:52.586
Let him see what
he wants to see.

38:54.275 --> 38:55.827
I don't know where
we are in the race.

38:55.862 --> 38:57.724
But I think about these things,

38:57.758 --> 39:00.103
I'm thinking about
these things all the time.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.724
I guess I've always been
that frame of win, win, win.

39:02.758 --> 39:07.551
I know jamiul is not so much
about it, but well, it is what it is.

39:09.034 --> 39:10.758
Yes.

39:10.793 --> 39:12.103
Rocky couldn't do this.

39:13.931 --> 39:14.931
Stay there.

39:15.379 --> 39:16.379
Nice.

39:20.379 --> 39:22.241
Two days of traveling
through Mexico.

39:22.275 --> 39:23.655
That's it. We're done.

39:23.689 --> 39:25.206
And now it's time to play.

39:26.413 --> 39:27.413
To the north,

39:27.448 --> 39:30.137
Michael and shuntelle
have arrived in Belize

39:31.103 --> 39:33.310
on a very special day.

39:33.344 --> 39:35.724
Let's go have a party
on independence day.

39:37.827 --> 39:41.586
This former British colony
gained independence in 1981

39:42.620 --> 39:44.586
and has a distinct
Caribbean vibe.

39:46.172 --> 39:47.103
Brilliant.

39:47.137 --> 39:49.413
The couple head to caye caulker,

39:49.448 --> 39:51.793
one of its 450 islands,

39:51.827 --> 39:54.931
studying the world's
second largest body of reef,

39:54.965 --> 39:56.965
aiming to join the celebrations.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.931
What a brilliant day
to come to Belize.

39:58.965 --> 40:00.517
I'm so glad to have made it.

40:00.551 --> 40:02.137
Today is a holiday day.

40:02.172 --> 40:04.379
The race begins again tomorrow.

40:04.413 --> 40:05.413
Play the music.

40:05.448 --> 40:07.068
Yeah. Party vibe.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.448
Let's go.

40:09.068 --> 40:10.068
This is paradise.

40:11.793 --> 40:13.689
I'll tell you what
we're looking for

40:13.724 --> 40:15.655
is camp out here
for the night. Yeah?

40:15.689 --> 40:17.551
We want to camp
out on the beach.

40:17.586 --> 40:18.931
- On the beach?
- Yeah.

40:18.965 --> 40:20.182
All of you can stay
right over there.

40:20.206 --> 40:21.551
Tell you what.
You take me there,

40:21.586 --> 40:23.103
I'll give you ten dollars.

40:23.137 --> 40:24.586
Michael?

40:24.620 --> 40:27.275
Well, what's
happened in the space?

40:28.344 --> 40:30.344
Um, I was just
checking the times

40:31.206 --> 40:33.034
to go back, and
Michael's following

40:33.068 --> 40:35.034
a gentleman in some red shorts.

40:35.068 --> 40:36.379
That's as much as I know.

40:37.586 --> 40:38.517
What we can do here.

40:38.551 --> 40:39.620
Maybe talk to me.

40:39.655 --> 40:41.034
Outside.

40:41.068 --> 40:44.000
My man has seen a few
decent company here.

40:44.827 --> 40:46.724
Well, in this garden?

40:46.758 --> 40:50.275
Yeah, we just... He's
just gonna sort it out.

40:53.965 --> 40:54.965
[Sighs]

40:58.413 --> 41:00.448
If we're supposed
to be camping here,

41:00.482 --> 41:03.275
how we then supposed
to enjoy the island?

41:03.310 --> 41:05.241
We've got nowhere
to put our stuff.

41:05.275 --> 41:08.068
We haven't done
anything yet, you know?

41:08.103 --> 41:09.551
I mean, if I make, you know.

41:09.586 --> 41:12.217
Yes, I should have negotiated
straight away with you in the beginning,

41:12.241 --> 41:13.758
but I didn't. I had
it on my mind.

41:13.793 --> 41:16.833
I'm on the wrong. That's it. I'm sorry,
but I'm still in the competition here.

41:18.758 --> 41:19.758
[Sighs]

41:19.793 --> 41:21.551
I'm just speechless,
really, at the moment.

41:21.586 --> 41:23.275
On this island to
enjoy ourselves,

41:23.310 --> 41:24.827
we're going to be in
an accommodation

41:24.862 --> 41:26.724
where we can't
secure our belongings.

41:26.758 --> 41:28.379
A random person who
he doesn't even know

41:28.413 --> 41:30.275
is happy to leave
his luggage with

41:30.310 --> 41:31.430
just doesn't make any sense.

41:34.724 --> 41:37.586
Please, you know,
give us a little bit here.

41:39.000 --> 41:40.172
I want to win this race.

41:40.206 --> 41:42.034
And that's what I thought
we both wanted, too.

41:43.241 --> 41:45.758
Do I look like someone
who slept outside in my life?

41:45.793 --> 41:48.482
No, but this is about
opening up your mind.

41:48.517 --> 41:51.206
I think doing this trip will
make or break our relationship.

41:51.241 --> 41:55.310
I think, you know, we've gotta
argue for pure eight weeks

41:55.344 --> 41:57.689
that I think might
realize that actually,

41:57.724 --> 41:59.758
we are too different
to be together.

42:02.655 --> 42:04.310
Or at the end of
the eight weeks,

42:04.344 --> 42:06.310
we might be like,
"fantastic. Let's get married."

42:06.344 --> 42:07.344
Kind of thing, you know.

42:08.172 --> 42:09.172
I don't know.

42:16.379 --> 42:17.379
Adios.

42:18.034 --> 42:19.206
Look how clean...

42:19.241 --> 42:21.586
Oh, yeah. This is spotless.

42:21.620 --> 42:24.827
While two more teams
cross into Guatemala...

42:24.862 --> 42:28.310
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

42:28.344 --> 42:29.620
- Hola.
- Hola.

42:31.517 --> 42:33.103
We're just traveling.
We don't know yet.

42:34.275 --> 42:37.758
Another has opened
up a lead, but at a price.

42:38.517 --> 42:40.068
I've been keeping a budget.

42:40.103 --> 42:42.724
We gained at 25 pounds a day.

42:42.758 --> 42:47.448
But so far we've
spent 160 pounds.

42:47.482 --> 42:50.551
So we could do this job here.

42:50.586 --> 42:53.344
Organic farm. Fifteen
minutes from Antigua.

42:53.379 --> 42:55.827
We need to earn
some money, don't we?

42:55.862 --> 42:57.931
Well, we've spent way too much.

42:58.793 --> 43:02.034
We've got all that way to go.

43:02.068 --> 43:03.068
Oh, my god.

43:17.655 --> 43:18.793
The following morning,

43:20.931 --> 43:24.172
dom and Lizzie wake
up to a nasty surprise.

43:24.206 --> 43:26.758
So our room is
completely flooded

43:26.793 --> 43:29.862
and all our stuff
is soaking wet.

43:29.896 --> 43:32.103
I'm really quite
annoyed about it actually.

43:32.137 --> 43:33.517
A lot of our stuff's
been ruined.

43:33.551 --> 43:35.862
Our passports and where anything

43:35.896 --> 43:37.655
that was touching
the floor is now ruined.

43:38.758 --> 43:40.482
And this is supposed
to be a nice hotel.

43:41.413 --> 43:42.793
We've got a hole in the ceiling.

43:48.206 --> 43:49.827
Okay. Okay.

43:51.793 --> 43:53.344
Okay. Gracias.

43:53.379 --> 43:55.310
That helps a little bit.

43:56.586 --> 43:57.862
Silver lining.

43:57.896 --> 44:01.000
Actually can't be
bothered to stay.

44:01.034 --> 44:03.689
Well, we just have to pull
ourselves together, I'm afraid.

44:03.724 --> 44:06.655
Yeah, I think we
need to be positive.

44:06.689 --> 44:08.310
Yeah. Just let me
be angry sometimes.

44:08.344 --> 44:09.448
Give me two minutes.

44:10.034 --> 44:11.413
That is such a minor.

44:14.344 --> 44:16.224
Yeah, but don't you
think it's just frustrating?

44:16.965 --> 44:19.172
- Okay.
- Just let me be angry.

44:19.206 --> 44:20.758
Okay. Sorry. I'll leave you be.

44:23.103 --> 44:26.000
He just doesn't understand and I
feel like I don't have anyone to talk to.

44:26.034 --> 44:27.379
'Cause his way of comforting is,

44:27.413 --> 44:29.896
"be positive or I'm gonna
get annoyed at you."

44:29.931 --> 44:31.103
I can see it in his face.

44:31.137 --> 44:33.448
He just doesn't want... He
can't be bothered with me.

44:33.482 --> 44:34.724
I think that's really not fair.

44:35.758 --> 44:37.241
I don't really know
what I'm gonna do.

44:38.586 --> 44:40.655
If you're upset, I
can comfort you.

44:40.689 --> 44:42.655
Yeah, but when you're
looking at me angrily,

44:42.689 --> 44:44.320
the last person I want
to speak to is you.

44:44.344 --> 44:45.896
Okay.

44:45.931 --> 44:49.586
Sometimes I think I've
been quiet about brother.

44:50.000 --> 44:51.344
Um.

44:51.379 --> 44:55.586
My mom and my dad try to
remind me that that's not the case.

44:55.620 --> 44:58.172
But when Lizzie broke
up with her boyfriend,

44:58.206 --> 45:01.724
she was so upset
and I felt helpless.

45:01.758 --> 45:06.137
And I felt like she couldn't really
confide and speak to me naturally.

45:06.827 --> 45:08.793
- Honduras.
- Yeah.

45:08.827 --> 45:10.275
Let's ask.

45:10.310 --> 45:12.896
We haven't been really open
with each other for such a long time.

45:14.068 --> 45:15.068
That was there.

45:15.724 --> 45:17.551
[Speaking Spanish]

45:17.586 --> 45:19.586
- Oh, here.
- Si.

45:19.620 --> 45:20.965
The soaked-through siblings

45:21.000 --> 45:23.827
face a farther 500
km to the checkpoint.

45:30.275 --> 45:33.206
And Belize, after
yesterday's disagreement,

45:33.241 --> 45:36.000
Michael and shuntelle
splashed out on a hose-down.

45:39.034 --> 45:41.655
So, the way I kind
of organized it,

45:41.689 --> 45:44.000
and, you know, I
wouldn't do that again

45:44.034 --> 45:47.241
without having a
confrontation with you.

45:47.275 --> 45:51.172
I'm trying to enjoy this
experience with Michael,

45:51.206 --> 45:54.000
and I did say I was going to
try and give everything a go,

45:54.034 --> 45:57.068
but obviously the reality of
going for it just freaked me out.

45:57.103 --> 45:59.896
I'm finding living out
of a bag really hard.

45:59.931 --> 46:02.344
Um, yesterday just
took me over the edge.

46:03.827 --> 46:04.862
- You okay now?
- Yeah.

46:04.896 --> 46:05.896
- We friends?
- Yeah.

46:08.310 --> 46:09.310
All right, cool.

46:14.620 --> 46:16.655
Honduras.

46:16.689 --> 46:18.482
Off we go home straight.

46:19.827 --> 46:22.344
While Michael and shuntelle
head back to the mainland...

46:26.206 --> 46:28.068
- What was your name? Sorry.
- Earl.

46:28.103 --> 46:29.000
Earl.

46:29.034 --> 46:30.689
[Inaudible]

46:30.724 --> 46:32.275
Yeah, I'm a musician.

46:32.310 --> 46:33.448
Oh, nice.

46:33.482 --> 46:36.413
Newly arrived in
Belize, Jen and Rob...

46:36.448 --> 46:38.655
- So where you headed?
- Headed to Honduras.

46:38.689 --> 46:41.172
How much will it
cost us to get there?

46:41.206 --> 46:43.655
You look like a police
officer, taking down notes.

46:44.724 --> 46:46.931
Look at these men, just
like having a little dip.

46:46.965 --> 46:50.896
Emon and jamiul, however,
are only just crossing the border.

46:50.931 --> 46:53.827
It's mad how you're just
literally on this crossover bridge,

46:53.862 --> 46:55.827
- and see you're here in another country.
- Yeah.

46:55.862 --> 46:57.000
Belize.

46:57.034 --> 46:59.114
To be honest with you, I
never heard of this country.

47:00.344 --> 47:01.931
The teams heading through Belize

47:01.965 --> 47:05.000
will be unable to reach
Honduras by land.

47:05.034 --> 47:07.482
For the past month,
a state of emergency

47:07.517 --> 47:10.620
has been in operation
in central Guatemala

47:10.655 --> 47:13.689
imposed by the government
in response to the killing

47:13.724 --> 47:15.448
of three soldiers,

47:15.482 --> 47:17.862
cutting off the area
from any travel.

47:19.103 --> 47:21.068
The teams will have
to continue their journey

47:21.103 --> 47:23.310
towards the checkpoint by boat.

47:24.862 --> 47:27.965
This is us both. Placencia.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.586
I think that's crossed. We end up
on the boat tomorrow into Honduras.

47:31.620 --> 47:33.758
Just one boat is
available a day,

47:33.793 --> 47:36.965
leaving from the port of
placencia at 9:00 each morning.

47:37.000 --> 47:38.344
How much is this, Robbie?

47:38.379 --> 47:39.379
Fourteen Belize, I think.

47:40.379 --> 47:41.379
Winning.

47:44.793 --> 47:46.620
We're about to get to Antigua.

47:46.655 --> 47:48.413
Just out at the square.

47:48.448 --> 47:52.896
Antigua, 270 km
from the checkpoint.

47:52.931 --> 47:55.000
Joe and Sam aim
to boost their budget

47:55.034 --> 47:56.862
by working at an organic farm.

48:00.586 --> 48:03.413
[Speaking Spanish]

48:03.448 --> 48:05.793
Start moving a little bit of
soil and look at the chickens.

48:05.827 --> 48:06.758
They love this stuff.

48:06.793 --> 48:07.793
They're happy chicken.

48:13.655 --> 48:14.655
Tired already, mum?

48:15.896 --> 48:16.896
Not good.

48:20.241 --> 48:22.448
When I was at school,
I was never academic.

48:22.482 --> 48:24.896
Started working as
a brick lift two years

48:24.931 --> 48:29.620
and that's when I found
the love for working outside

48:29.655 --> 48:32.689
because I've attention
deficit hyperactive disorder.

48:32.724 --> 48:35.482
I'm a nutter, basically, and it
gets in the way of everything.

48:35.517 --> 48:36.896
Just been selling boxes,

48:36.931 --> 48:39.344
not been able to
burn my energy off.

48:39.379 --> 48:42.172
So far, we're halfway done
and doing a great job at that.

48:44.206 --> 48:45.448
- You all right, mum?
- Yes.

48:45.482 --> 48:46.965
Look at her. She's working hard.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.517
She's doing what I do.

48:49.896 --> 48:51.586
Oh, that's me.

48:51.620 --> 48:53.586
- You good?
- Blood sugar.

48:55.241 --> 48:56.862
I'm watching you
and the vultures, mum.

48:56.896 --> 48:58.965
- [Laughs]
- Yeah. See.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.413
Stop using your
diabetes as an excuse.

49:01.448 --> 49:02.448
[Both laugh]

49:08.517 --> 49:09.724
6:00 A.M.

49:10.931 --> 49:12.413
How much to the border?

49:12.448 --> 49:13.724
- To placencia.
- To placencia?

49:13.758 --> 49:15.931
- Yeah.
- That's 175 Euros.

49:15.965 --> 49:18.758
Determined to catch the
only boat to Honduras today...

49:18.793 --> 49:19.931
Sort me out.

49:19.965 --> 49:21.517
I was going to walk there today.

49:21.551 --> 49:22.827
One-sixty, yeah?

49:22.862 --> 49:24.068
- All right.
- Okay.

49:24.103 --> 49:26.793
Emon and jamiul
stump up five percent

49:26.827 --> 49:30.620
of the entire budget
to race across Belize.

49:30.655 --> 49:32.862
I just wanna make
sure we get on that boat.

49:32.896 --> 49:35.758
What do we do now? I think, uh,

49:35.793 --> 49:37.379
we can count ourselves
back in the race.

49:38.344 --> 49:39.655
Honduras, here we come.

49:41.931 --> 49:44.620
If we miss this boat, Robbie,
because we've not been doing anything.

49:44.655 --> 49:46.310
I'm sweating already. It's 8:00.

49:47.689 --> 49:48.689
Oh, look.

49:49.965 --> 49:51.413
Let's stop here.
Let's stop here.

49:51.448 --> 49:53.517
- Keep going. Keep going.
- Oh, my god.

49:53.551 --> 49:54.931
We need to get a move along.

49:55.517 --> 49:57.034
Oh, my days.

49:57.068 --> 49:58.931
Seeing that team
threw me off, man.

49:58.965 --> 49:59.965
This one here.

50:00.000 --> 50:02.413
Just go in, just
go in, just go in.

50:02.448 --> 50:03.448
Now stop here, please.

50:04.862 --> 50:06.034
You get yourself a ticket

50:06.068 --> 50:07.241
and let me pay this guy.

50:08.413 --> 50:09.827
Wanted to see you guys here.

50:09.862 --> 50:11.517
- How you doing?
- All right.

50:11.551 --> 50:12.551
How are ya?

50:12.586 --> 50:14.620
We did not think anybody
else would be here.

50:14.655 --> 50:16.758
- When did you get here?
- Literally just now.

50:16.793 --> 50:18.034
- Just now?
- Just now.

50:18.068 --> 50:19.896
Guys, I think we
have to get our tickets.

50:19.931 --> 50:21.827
Oh, you've not got
your tickets yet?

50:21.862 --> 50:23.241
Jesus. Okay.

50:23.275 --> 50:24.275
Jesus?

50:25.793 --> 50:27.103
Oh, my god.

50:31.551 --> 50:35.000
Have you got any more
spaces on your boat across?

50:35.034 --> 50:37.034
Guys, I'm sorry, we
don't have any more.

50:37.068 --> 50:38.241
- Oh.
- Jesus.

50:38.275 --> 50:39.275
All filled up.

50:40.206 --> 50:41.448
Oh, no.

50:41.482 --> 50:43.827
But you can purchase a ticket
now for your space tomorrow.

50:43.862 --> 50:45.172
[Sighs]

50:45.793 --> 50:46.793
Well done.

50:47.413 --> 50:48.413
Where are they?

50:49.482 --> 50:51.275
Babe, the couple, they're there.

50:51.310 --> 50:53.068
- [Gasps]
- Huh?

50:53.103 --> 50:54.896
We've got the husband and wife.

50:54.931 --> 50:56.965
Hey, guys. [Whistles]

50:57.344 --> 50:58.344
Hi!

50:58.931 --> 51:00.724
[Inaudible]

51:00.758 --> 51:02.206
You got your
tickets this morning?

51:02.241 --> 51:04.206
Yeah, we got our tickets
in the morning, yeah.

51:04.241 --> 51:05.965
- Oh, my god.
- Been here a while.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.344
- Have you?
- Been here a while?

51:07.379 --> 51:09.000
- Yeah.
- Oh. All right.

51:09.034 --> 51:11.862
Twenty-four hours behind now
because we missed the boat today.

51:11.896 --> 51:13.586
That's a big, big
problem for us.

51:16.206 --> 51:17.344
When did you guys arrive?

51:17.965 --> 51:19.103
Yesterday afternoon.

51:19.137 --> 51:20.517
- Goodness. That's tight.
- Yeah.

51:20.551 --> 51:23.137
We stayed in a hostel last night.
Never stayed in a hostel before.

51:23.172 --> 51:25.241
- We shared with how many people...
- You did a dorm?

51:25.275 --> 51:27.034
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you probably went.

51:27.068 --> 51:30.068
Okay. I've gotta
figure out dorm life.

51:30.103 --> 51:31.137
Yeah. More would be good.

51:31.172 --> 51:32.724
She can do it, so can I.

51:32.758 --> 51:34.344
There you go.

51:34.379 --> 51:35.275
I can do it.

51:35.310 --> 51:37.241
No holiday mode.
We're in competition.

51:40.310 --> 51:41.241
Okay.

51:41.275 --> 51:42.793
- Be strategic.
- Game on.

51:49.896 --> 51:52.034
The heat is really on now.

51:52.068 --> 51:53.206
Open my eyes.

51:53.241 --> 51:55.068
I can't say I haven't
tried already,

51:55.103 --> 51:57.931
but seeing them
in the boat with me

51:57.965 --> 51:59.448
it's official it's real.

52:01.137 --> 52:03.241
I'll bring out some reserves.

52:03.275 --> 52:05.172
I didn't know I had
but I'll find some.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.000
Jump in, man.

52:17.068 --> 52:19.620
Just proper gutted,
wounded about it.

52:19.655 --> 52:20.896
We want tickets for tomorrow,

52:20.931 --> 52:22.379
so we'll just chill out here.

52:22.413 --> 52:23.827
Yeah. What will you do?

52:25.758 --> 52:28.724
I was thinking that we could
potentially find some work to do here.

52:28.758 --> 52:30.586
I don't think we'll
find any. Just chill out.

52:32.758 --> 52:36.379
Of course, I have a lot of respect
for my uncle because he's an elder.

52:36.413 --> 52:38.758
Um, I know he's not all
that much older than me.

52:38.793 --> 52:40.413
But he's still an
elder nonetheless,

52:40.448 --> 52:42.379
and if he thinks that
his ways are better,

52:42.413 --> 52:44.241
I'll put it down to experience.

52:45.724 --> 52:48.586
As emon and jamiul sit tight

52:48.620 --> 52:51.034
and two teams head
across the Caribbean...

52:55.310 --> 52:57.172
Okay, guys. Well,
thanks for your work.

52:57.206 --> 52:59.827
So here's, uh,
60 each. It's 120.

52:59.862 --> 53:03.068
So, uh, that will
help your trip.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.517
Okay.

53:05.551 --> 53:07.344
Closing in from the south,

53:07.379 --> 53:08.793
Joe and Sam

53:08.827 --> 53:10.000
and dom and Lizzie.

53:13.551 --> 53:16.241
[Speaking Spanish]

53:25.931 --> 53:26.965
Okay.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.034
Uh, oh, god.

53:30.344 --> 53:31.896
I'm shaking with nerves now.

53:31.931 --> 53:33.689
We're getting through
the Honduran border,

53:33.724 --> 53:37.344
and that is in within touching
distance from the checkpoint.

53:37.379 --> 53:38.689
Yeah, I know.

53:38.724 --> 53:40.137
Another border bites the dust.

53:43.413 --> 53:44.965
Just across the border,

53:45.000 --> 53:48.275
the first checkpoint on
the epic journey to ushuaia.

53:49.103 --> 53:50.103
Copan ruinas.

53:52.724 --> 53:54.586
We're here. We are here.

53:58.275 --> 54:00.413
Oh. Okay.

54:00.448 --> 54:04.827
The GPS tracker tells them the
exact location of the checkpoint...

54:04.862 --> 54:07.517
Please proceed
to the clarion hotel.

54:07.551 --> 54:09.517
Three kilometers
outside the town.

54:10.379 --> 54:12.517
Turns that way.

54:12.551 --> 54:13.551
Okay, let's go.

54:15.034 --> 54:16.896
We are here.

54:16.931 --> 54:19.827
Where's the bus
station to copan?

54:19.862 --> 54:21.103
We need to get here tonight.

54:21.137 --> 54:22.448
- Is that achievable?
- Yeah.

54:22.482 --> 54:24.862
[Jo] We need to know
what time the bus goes there

54:24.896 --> 54:26.379
'cause I can't
obviously miss it.

54:27.655 --> 54:29.034
I think it should be up here.

54:31.551 --> 54:33.379
I think it's here, mum.

54:33.413 --> 54:35.620
Here, let's go through this.

54:36.275 --> 54:38.275
[Sam] Let's go here, mum.

54:38.310 --> 54:41.310
Senor, clarion hotel? Bueno.

54:45.482 --> 54:47.758
Okay, almost. Almost.

54:49.344 --> 54:52.482
[Sam] So, this is
a big movement.

54:57.275 --> 55:01.172
- [Jo] Right on.
- [Sam] Let's go, let's go.

55:01.206 --> 55:03.068
Oh. [Laughs]

55:05.310 --> 55:08.862
- Can you see it? [Panting]
- Nearly there, mum.

55:12.172 --> 55:15.586
- Hola.
- [Man] Hi, welcome to the the hotel clarion.

55:16.172 --> 55:17.931
[Speaks Spanish]

55:17.965 --> 55:19.517
If you could sign in, please.

55:19.551 --> 55:23.241
[Narrator] Each team must sign
in to find out its position in the race.

55:24.862 --> 55:27.965
- Your name and signature, please.
- Oh, my god, we're first!

55:28.000 --> 55:29.379
Oh, my god. [Laughing]

55:32.758 --> 55:35.620
I can't believe
that we're first.

55:35.655 --> 55:41.034
Right. [Laughs excitedly]

55:41.068 --> 55:45.137
I think the key strength was my
mum speaking a little bit of Spanish

55:45.172 --> 55:47.448
and being able to
ask the questions.

55:47.482 --> 55:49.931
The guys we met in
the bar gave us an idea

55:49.965 --> 55:51.344
of the route through Guatemala.

55:51.379 --> 55:53.724
Meeting them definitely
helps us massively.

55:54.551 --> 55:55.551
Really, well done, love.

55:56.068 --> 55:57.068
You did really well.

55:57.103 --> 55:58.482
[Laughs]

56:03.655 --> 56:04.655
[Dog whimpers]

56:09.137 --> 56:11.034
[Man] Going to be a
muddy scramble to the top.

56:11.068 --> 56:12.344
Nah.

56:12.379 --> 56:14.413
I'm not really dressed
for this type of weather.

56:16.724 --> 56:17.724
[Dom] Come on.

56:19.965 --> 56:23.034
Don't wait for me. We're
finishing this together.

56:23.551 --> 56:24.551
[Dom] Okay.

56:25.310 --> 56:27.000
Oh, my god, we're nearly there.

56:27.034 --> 56:28.931
- [Panting]
- Hola.

56:28.965 --> 56:29.827
[Woman] Hola.

56:29.862 --> 56:31.482
Okay. Do we want to open this?

56:31.517 --> 56:33.000
- Yeah.
- Okay.

56:34.689 --> 56:37.241
- Oh, we're second.
- Come on! [Laughs]

56:38.655 --> 56:41.551
- Oh, I'll take second any day.
- Yeah.

56:41.586 --> 56:42.586
No way.

56:42.965 --> 56:44.655
Oh, my god.

56:44.689 --> 56:46.310
[Dom] I think when
we opened that book,

56:46.344 --> 56:48.172
I was just like... I
even gave you a hug.

56:48.206 --> 56:50.000
I know that's like...
That means happiness.

56:50.034 --> 56:52.103
- Like, I don't do that often.
- [Laughs]

56:52.137 --> 56:55.241
[Dom] I'm starting to think may
be we could have come first now.

56:55.275 --> 56:57.976
-We've got a chance. Like, we've got a chance.
-We do. We're up there.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.758
It's set us up for
the rest of this race.

57:02.862 --> 57:07.172
This is awful. We just need to
find somewhere to stay asap.

57:07.206 --> 57:10.310
I think we're just gonna have
to take the hit 'cause look.

57:10.344 --> 57:13.206
[Narrator] As tropical
storm Karen lashes down

57:13.241 --> 57:16.103
Michael and shuntelle

57:16.137 --> 57:17.482
Look at that.

57:17.517 --> 57:19.517
[Narrator] Are
forced to take shelter

57:19.551 --> 57:21.896
70 kilometers shy
of the checkpoint.

57:21.931 --> 57:22.827
[Woman] What's the price?

57:22.862 --> 57:24.931
- Two-fifty.
- Two-fifty?

57:24.965 --> 57:26.517
Two-fifty.

57:26.551 --> 57:28.734
I'm not looking forward to staying
here, to be completely honest with you.

57:28.758 --> 57:30.310
Absolute dive.

57:30.793 --> 57:31.793
[Thunder rumbling]

57:33.413 --> 57:35.896
- What a lovely day.
- [Laughs]

57:35.931 --> 57:37.551
Everything's wet,
our trainers are wet,

57:37.586 --> 57:39.965
our socks are wet,
our coats are wet,

57:40.000 --> 57:42.310
our hair's wet... It's just wet.

57:44.000 --> 57:45.413
[Speaking indistinctly]

57:45.448 --> 57:46.931
[Speaking Spanish]

57:46.965 --> 57:48.034
[Sighs in exasperation]

57:51.034 --> 57:52.793
I would be at the check point.

57:52.827 --> 57:56.068
I thought I would be able to
wash my clothes, was my body,

57:56.103 --> 57:58.034
but instead, robby, guess
what's just happened,

57:58.068 --> 57:59.517
I've gone to turn t tap on,

57:59.551 --> 58:01.827
and it's broken off
in my hand. [Laughs]

58:01.862 --> 58:04.586
Um, I've had these pants
on now for three days.

58:07.862 --> 58:09.620
Come on!

58:09.655 --> 58:13.034
[Narrator] The 23,000
kilometers remaining to ushuaia.

58:13.068 --> 58:14.620
Are full of beauty...

58:14.655 --> 58:16.586
We can see it. We can see it.

58:16.620 --> 58:18.206
[Narrator] But full of dangers

58:19.586 --> 58:20.758
and conflict...

58:20.793 --> 58:22.482
- Get off me.
- Oops.

Next time...

58:28.275 --> 58:29.551
We've been to this jungle.

58:29.586 --> 58:31.310
[Woman] Where
did that come from?

58:31.344 --> 58:32.493
[Narrator] Dreams
are fulfilled...

58:32.517 --> 58:33.482
Beautiful.

58:33.517 --> 58:36.068
I've never seen that before.

58:36.103 --> 58:39.482
[Narrator] ...As the teams battle
across five countries of Central America...

58:45.724 --> 58:46.724
