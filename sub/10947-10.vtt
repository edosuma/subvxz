skills are great,</i>

00:34.830 --> 00:37.710

01:52.580 --> 01:53.580

01:54.080 --> 01:55.620
You can tell from the metalwork.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.580
We'd better pack up camp
and get moving.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.670
Uh-uh! No flying this time.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.540
What? Why wouldn't we fly?

02:03.630 --> 02:04.750
Think about it.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.210
Somehow Prince Zuko
and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

02:07.550 --> 02:09.970
It's because they spot Appa,
he's just too noticeable.

02:10.050 --> 02:12.430
What? Appa's not too noticeable.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.260
He's a gigantic fluffy monster
with an arrow on his head!

02:15.390 --> 02:16.520
It's kind of hard to miss him.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.230
( GROWLS )

02:18.310 --> 02:20.440
Sokka's just jealous
because he doesn't have an arrow.

02:20.770 --> 02:21.940
I know you all want to fly,

02:22.020 --> 02:23.110
but my instincts tell me

02:23.190 --> 02:24.860
we should play it safe
this time and walk.

02:25.150 --> 02:26.610
Who made you the boss?

02:26.690 --> 02:28.280
I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.610
You're the leader?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.660
But your voice still cracks.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.700
I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior!

02:34.780 --> 02:36.580
So I'm the leader.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.500
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.460
I mean, he is the Avatar.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.630
Are you kidding?
He's just a goofy kid.

02:43.790 --> 02:44.920
He's right.

02:45.420 --> 02:47.840
Why do boys always think
someone has to be the leader?

02:48.510 --> 02:50.840
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy
if you kissed a girl.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.340
I've kissed a girl!

02:52.430 --> 02:53.550
You just haven't met her.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.760
Who? Gran-Gran?

02:55.850 --> 02:57.310
I've met Gran-Gran.

02:57.390 --> 02:58.810
No, besides Gran-Gran.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.930
Look, my instincts tell me

03:01.020 --> 03:02.770
we have a better chance
of slipping through on foot,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.610
and a leader has to
trust his instincts.

03:04.690 --> 03:08.110
Ok, we'll try it your way,
O wise leader.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.030
Who knows? Walking might be fun.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.530
Walking stinks!

03:12.910 --> 03:15.120
How did people go anywhere
without a flying bison?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.660
I don't know, Aang.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.370
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts?

03:18.580 --> 03:20.370
They seem to know everything.

03:20.580 --> 03:21.910
SOKKA: Ha ha, very funny.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.040
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.540
You know who you should
ask to carry it for a while?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.000
Sokka's instincts!

03:28.210 --> 03:29.760
That's a great idea.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.970
Hey, Sokka's instincts,
would you mindâ€•

03:32.050 --> 03:33.760
Ok, ok, I get it!

03:33.840 --> 03:35.510
Look, guys, I'm tired, too.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.600
But the important thing is that
we're safe from the Fire Nation.

03:43.810 --> 03:44.810
Run!

03:47.230 --> 03:48.230
Huh!

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
We're cut off!

Sokka, your shirt!

03:51.650 --> 03:52.650
Aah!

04:00.700 --> 04:03.250
If you let us pass,
we promise not to hurt you.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.960
What are you doing?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.380

Unh.

Uhh...

04:12.170 --> 04:14.550
Nice work, Sokka. How did you do that?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.430
Uh... Instinct?

almost single-handed.

05:41.390 --> 05:42.720
Army?!

05:42.810 --> 05:45.020
There were only, like, 20 guys.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.850

05:46.930 --> 05:48.190
and these are my freedom fighters.

05:52.270 --> 05:53.980

06:23.600 --> 06:24.810
We're lucky you were there.

06:24.890 --> 06:26.520
I should be thanking you.

06:26.810 --> 06:29.020
We were waiting to ambush
those soldiers all morning.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.690
We just needed the right distraction.

06:30.770 --> 06:32.350
And then you guys stumbled in.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.480
We were relying on instincts.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.320
JET: You'll get yourself
killed doing that.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.950

06:41.450 --> 06:44.530
Hey, Jet, these barrels are filled
with blasting jelly.

That's a great score.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.950
And these boxes are filled
with jellied candy.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.710
Also good.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.040
Let's not get those mixed up.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.830
We'll take the stuff
back to the hideout.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.630
You guys have a hideout?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You want to see it?

06:57.090 --> 06:58.090
Yes, we want to see it!

07:02.180 --> 07:03.260

07:03.470 --> 07:04.970
Where? There's nothing here.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.220
Hold this.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.510
Why? What's this do?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.470
Aah!

07:09.560 --> 07:10.600
Aang?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.850
I'll get up on my own.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.320
Grab hold of me, Katara.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.830
Nice place you got!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.630
It's beautiful up here.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.840
It's beautiful, and more importantly,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.470
the Fire Nation can't find us.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.220
They would love to find you,

07:46.300 --> 07:47.600
wouldn't they, Jet?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.390
It's not going to happen, Smellerbee.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.520
KATARA: Why does the Fire Nation
want to find you?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.980
JET: I guess you could say

07:53.060 --> 07:54.560
I've been causing them
a little trouble.

07:54.650 --> 07:56.690
See, they took over a nearby
Earth Kingdom town

07:56.770 --> 07:57.770
a few years back.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.440
We've been ambushing their troops,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.110
cutting off their supply lines,

08:01.190 --> 08:03.570
and doing anything we can
to mess with them.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.410
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation

08:05.490 --> 08:06.490
out of here for good,

08:06.570 --> 08:07.570
And free that town.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.450
That's so brave.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.290
Yeah, nothing's braver
than a guy in a tree house.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.250
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.750
No problem. He probably
had a rough day.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.380
So, you all live here?

08:18.460 --> 08:19.460
That's right.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.920
Longshot over there,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.420
His town got burned down
by the Fire Nation.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.550
And we found The Duke
trying to steal our food.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.930
I don't think he ever
really had a home.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.510
What about you?

08:31.390 --> 08:32.980
The Fire Nation killed my parents.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.560
I was only eight years old.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.650
That day changed me forever.

08:37.730 --> 08:40.650

from the look on one soldier's face,

when The Duke dropped down
on his helmet

and rode him like a wild hog-monkey!

about a couple of kids
hiding in the trees.

09:18.190 --> 09:19.690

that you and Aang
can help in our struggle.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.870
( LAUGHING )

11:38.950 --> 11:41.080
Sokka, look what The Duke gave me.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.960
( HISSES )

11:48.460 --> 11:50.010
Ow, quit it!

11:50.670 --> 11:52.470
Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.550
Yeah, he's back. But we're leaving.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.720
What?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.510
But I made him this hat.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.970
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.060
What?!

12:01.140 --> 12:02.350
No, he's not.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.060
He's messed up, Katara.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.270
AANG: He's not messed up.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.020
He's just got a different way of life.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.570
A really fun way of life.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.030
He beat and robbed

12:10.110 --> 12:11.280
a harmless old man.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.280
I want to hear
Jet's side of the story.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.740
Sokka, you told them what happened,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.280
but you didn't mention
that the guy was Fire Nation?

12:19.370 --> 12:21.910
No, he conveniently
left that part out.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.210
Fine, but even if he was Fire Nation,

12:24.290 --> 12:25.580
he was a harmless civilian.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.210
He was an assassin, Sokka.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.840
See? There's a compartment
for poison in the knife.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.420
He was sent to eliminate me.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.430
You helped save my life, Sokka.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.390
I knew there was an explanation.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.180
I didn't see any knife.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.060
That's because he was concealing it.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.640
See, Sokka?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.850
I'm sure you just
didn't notice the knife.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.650
There was no knife!

12:47.850 --> 12:49.020
I'm going back to the hut

12:49.110 --> 12:50.440
and packing my things.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.860
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.400
I really need your help.

12:54.490 --> 12:55.530
What can we do?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.990
The Fire Nation is planning
on burning down our forest.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.330
If you both use waterbending
to fill the reservoir,

13:00.410 --> 13:01.700
we could fight the fires.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.330
But if you leave now,

13:03.410 --> 13:05.040
they'll destroy the whole valley.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.500
We can't leave now

13:10.590 --> 13:12.880
with the Fire Nation
about to burn down a forest!

13:12.960 --> 13:14.380
I'm sorry, Katara.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.470
Jet's very smooth,
but we can't trust him.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.470
You know what I think?

13:18.550 --> 13:21.260
You're jealous that he's a better
warrior and a better leader.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.520
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.720
It's just that my instinctsâ€•

13:24.810 --> 13:26.390
Well, my instincts tell me

13:26.480 --> 13:28.560
we need to stay here a little longer
and help Jet.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.230
Come on, Aang.

13:30.650 --> 13:31.650
Sorry, Sokka.

13:34.650 --> 13:36.070
( SNORING )

13:41.950 --> 13:42.950
JET: Let's go.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.040
Huh?

14:05.640 --> 14:06.770
Now listen.

14:06.850 --> 14:08.980
You're not to blow the dam
until I give the signal.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.770
If the reservoir isn't full,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.650
the Fire Nation troops could survive.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.110
But what about the people in the town?

14:15.190 --> 14:17.030
Won't they get wiped out, too?

14:17.240 --> 14:18.780
Look, Duke, that's the price

14:18.860 --> 14:20.860
of ridding this area
of the Fire Nation.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.740
Now don't blow the dam
until I give the signal.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.830
Got it?

14:25.330 --> 14:26.540
( RUSTLING )

14:26.950 --> 14:28.080
Ow!

14:28.580 --> 14:31.250
Where do you think
you're going, ponytail?

14:36.590 --> 14:37.670
JET: Sokka.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.920
I'm glad you decided to join us.

14:40.930 --> 14:43.510
I heard your plan
to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.010
Our plan is to rid the valley
of the Fire Nation.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.810
There are people living there, Jet,

14:47.890 --> 14:49.640
mothers and fathers and children.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.730
We can't win without
making some sacrifices.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.110
You lied to Aang and Katara
about the forest fire.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.440
Because they don't understand
the demands of war.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.940
Not like you and I do.

14:59.150 --> 15:00.490
I do understand.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.070
I understand that
there's nothing you won't do

15:02.160 --> 15:03.320
to get what you want.

15:03.910 --> 15:06.120
I was hoping you'd have an open mind.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.080
But I can see you've made your choice.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.000
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.330
Take him for a walk.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.670
A long walk.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.500
You can't do this!

15:16.590 --> 15:17.920
Cheer up, Sokka.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.670
We're going to win a great victory

15:19.760 --> 15:20.880
against the Fire Nation today.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.890
KATARA: Jet, I'm sorry about how
Sokka's been acting.

15:26.970 --> 15:29.350
No worries. He already apologized.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.940
Really? Sokka apologized?

15:32.310 --> 15:33.900
Yeah, I was surprised, too.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.690
I got the sense that maybe you

15:35.770 --> 15:36.770
Talked to him or something.

15:36.860 --> 15:37.980
Yeah, I did.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.730
I guess something you said
got through to him.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.070
Anyhow, he went out
on a scouting mission

15:42.150 --> 15:43.780
with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.950
I'm glad he cooled off.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.990
He's so stubborn sometimes.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.080
Uhh!

15:49.040 --> 15:50.290
All right, we're here.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.580
Underground water's trying
to escape from these vents.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.670
I need you guys to help it along.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.750
I've never used bending
on water I can't see.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.210
I don't know...

15:59.420 --> 16:01.880
Katara, you can do this.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.380
What about me?

16:03.590 --> 16:05.550
I know the Avatar can do this.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.740
JET: Yes! Good job.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.580
This river empties into the reservoir.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.370
A few more geysers
and it will be full.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Look, there's another steam vent.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.880
Ok, you two keep it up,

16:37.960 --> 16:39.460
I'll go check on things
at the reservoir.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.960
KATARA: When we're done,
we'll meet you over there.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.180
Actually, probably better
if you meet me

16:45.260 --> 16:46.550
back at the hideout when you're done.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.520
I bet that's enough.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.060
And I'm not just
saying that to be lazy.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.190
Let's catch up with Jet
at the reservoir.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.530
I thought we agreed
to meet Jet back at the hideout.

17:04.610 --> 17:06.150
Well, we finished early.

17:06.570 --> 17:07.910
I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.160
Come on, move along!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.790
How can you stand by and do nothing

17:14.870 --> 17:16.710
while Jet wipes out a whole town?

17:17.040 --> 17:19.330
Hey, listen, Sokka,
Jet's a great leader.

17:19.420 --> 17:23.090
We follow what he says,
and things always turn out ok.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.340
If that's how Jet leads,

17:29.760 --> 17:30.930
Then he's got a lot to learn!

17:31.010 --> 17:32.010
Hey!

17:34.020 --> 17:35.020
Unh!

17:36.310 --> 17:37.520
While you two are up there,

17:37.600 --> 17:39.690
you might want to practice
your knot work.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.150
Hey, Smellerbee.

17:42.230 --> 17:44.150
You going to eat your lychee nuts?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.360
Ooh.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.620
What are they doing?

17:53.700 --> 17:55.080
Hey, those are the red barrels

17:55.160 --> 17:56.330
he got from the Fire Nation.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.370
Why would they need blasting jelly?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.040
Because Jet's going to
blow up the dam.

18:01.460 --> 18:02.460
What?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.340
No, that would destroy the town.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.010
Jet wouldn't do that.

18:06.090 --> 18:07.630
I've got to stop him!

18:08.130 --> 18:09.430
Jet wouldn't do that.

18:09.930 --> 18:10.970
Unh!

18:12.600 --> 18:13.640
Yes, I would.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.970
Jet, why?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.600
Katara, you would, too,
if you just stop to think.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.900
Think about what the Fire Nation
did to your mother.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.520
We can't let them do that
to anyone else ever again.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.530
This isn't the answer.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.780
I want you to understand me, Katara.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.320
I thought your brother
would understand, butâ€•

18:30.700 --> 18:32.240
Where's Sokka?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.320
Katara.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.410
Unh!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.290
I need to get to the dam.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.210
You're not going anywhere
without your glider.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.710
Unh! Uhh! Unh!

18:48.840 --> 18:50.260
I'm not going to fight you, Jet.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.220
You'll have to
if you want your glider back.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.400

I can't believe I trusted you.

20:34.740 --> 20:36.030
You lied to me!

Unh!

20:54.220 --> 20:55.550
Sokka's still out there.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.340
He's our only chance.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.100
Come on, Sokka.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.100
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.180
Please...

21:09.770 --> 21:10.860
No.

All those people.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.130
Jet, you monster!

21:36.220 --> 21:37.840
This was a victory, Katara.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.090
Remember that.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.550
The Fire Nation is gone,

21:40.640 --> 21:41.720
and this valley will be safe.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.430
SOKKA: It will be safe,

21:43.510 --> 21:45.270
without you.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.020
Sokka!

21:47.230 --> 21:48.600
I warned the villagers of your plan,

21:48.690 --> 21:49.690
Just in time.

21:49.770 --> 21:52.110
- What?!
- At first, they didn't believe me.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.780
The Fire Nation soldiers
assumed I was a spy.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.150
But one man vouched for me,

21:56.240 --> 21:58.280
the old man you attacked.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.490
He urged them to trust me,
and we got everyone out in time.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.830
Mrs. Pretty!

22:09.580 --> 22:10.960
Sokka, you fool!

22:11.040 --> 22:12.130
We could have freed this valley!

22:12.210 --> 22:13.380
Who would be free?

22:13.750 --> 22:14.880
Everyone would be dead.

22:15.340 --> 22:16.340
You traitor!

22:16.420 --> 22:18.220
No, Jet. You became the traitor

22:18.300 --> 22:20.180
when you stopped
protecting innocent people.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.100
Katara, please, help me.

22:23.350 --> 22:24.850
Good-bye, Jet.

the wrong way, right?
