<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

00:34.830 --> 00:37.710

01:52.580 --> 01:53.580

01:54.080 --> 01:55.620
You can tell from the metalwork.

01:55.700 --> 01:57.580
We'd better pack up camp
and get moving.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.670
Uh-uh! No flying this time.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.540
What? Why wouldn't we fly?

02:03.630 --> 02:04.750
Think about it.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.210
Somehow Prince Zuko
and the Fire Nation keep finding us.

02:07.550 --> 02:09.970
It's because they spot Appa,
he's just too noticeable.

02:10.050 --> 02:12.430
What? Appa's not too noticeable.

02:12.550 --> 02:15.260
He's a gigantic fluffy monster
with an arrow on his head!

02:15.390 --> 02:16.520
It's kind of hard to miss him.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.230
( GROWLS )

02:18.310 --> 02:20.440
Sokka's just jealous
because he doesn't have an arrow.

02:20.770 --> 02:21.940
I know you all want to fly,

02:22.020 --> 02:23.110
but my instincts tell me

02:23.190 --> 02:24.860
we should play it safe
this time and walk.

02:25.150 --> 02:26.610
Who made you the boss?

02:26.690 --> 02:28.280
I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.

02:28.610 --> 02:30.610
You're the leader?

02:30.700 --> 02:32.660
But your voice still cracks.

02:32.740 --> 02:34.700
I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior!

02:34.780 --> 02:36.580
So I'm the leader.

02:36.660 --> 02:38.500
If anyone's the leader, it's Aang.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.460
I mean, he is the Avatar.

02:40.660 --> 02:42.630
Are you kidding?
He's just a goofy kid.

02:43.790 --> 02:44.920
He's right.

02:45.420 --> 02:47.840
Why do boys always think
someone has to be the leader?

02:48.510 --> 02:50.840
I bet you wouldn't be so bossy
if you kissed a girl.

02:51.130 --> 02:52.340
I've kissed a girl!

02:52.430 --> 02:53.550
You just haven't met her.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.760
Who? Gran-Gran?

02:55.850 --> 02:57.310
I've met Gran-Gran.

02:57.390 --> 02:58.810
No, besides Gran-Gran.

02:58.890 --> 03:00.930
Look, my instincts tell me

03:01.020 --> 03:02.770
we have a better chance
of slipping through on foot,

03:02.850 --> 03:04.610
and a leader has to
trust his instincts.

03:04.690 --> 03:08.110
Ok, we'll try it your way,
O wise leader.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.030
Who knows? Walking might be fun.

03:11.200 --> 03:12.530
Walking stinks!

03:12.910 --> 03:15.120
How did people go anywhere
without a flying bison?

03:15.200 --> 03:16.660
I don't know, Aang.

03:16.740 --> 03:18.370
Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts?

03:18.580 --> 03:20.370
They seem to know everything.

03:20.580 --> 03:21.910
SOKKA: Ha ha, very funny.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.040
I'm tired of carrying this pack.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.540
You know who you should
ask to carry it for a while?

03:26.750 --> 03:28.000
Sokka's instincts!

03:28.210 --> 03:29.760
That's a great idea.

03:30.170 --> 03:31.970
Hey, Sokka's instincts,
would you mind―

03:32.050 --> 03:33.760
Ok, ok, I get it!

03:33.840 --> 03:35.510
Look, guys, I'm tired, too.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.600
But the important thing is that
we're safe from the Fire Nation.

03:43.810 --> 03:44.810
Run!

03:47.230 --> 03:48.230
Huh!

03:49.320 --> 03:50.320
We're cut off!

03:50.400 --> 03:51.570
Sokka, your shirt!

03:51.650 --> 03:52.650
Aah!

04:00.700 --> 04:03.250
If you let us pass,
we promise not to hurt you.

04:03.710 --> 04:04.960
What are you doing?

04:05.040 --> 04:06.380

Unh.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.090
Uhh...

04:12.170 --> 04:14.550
Nice work, Sokka. How did you do that?

04:14.630 --> 04:16.430
Uh... Instinct?

04:16.840 --> 04:17.850
Look!

You just took out a whole army
almost single-handed.

05:41.390 --> 05:42.720
Army?!

05:42.810 --> 05:45.020
There were only, like, 20 guys.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.190

05:52.270 --> 05:53.980

06:23.600 --> 06:24.810
We're lucky you were there.

06:24.890 --> 06:26.520
I should be thanking you.

06:26.810 --> 06:29.020
We were waiting to ambush
those soldiers all morning.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.690
We just needed the right distraction.

06:30.770 --> 06:32.350
And then you guys stumbled in.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.480
We were relying on instincts.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.320
JET: You'll get yourself
killed doing that.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.950

06:41.450 --> 06:44.530
Hey, Jet, these barrels are filled
with blasting jelly.

That's a great score.

06:46.410 --> 06:48.950
And these boxes are filled
with jellied candy.

06:49.290 --> 06:50.710
Also good.

06:50.790 --> 06:52.040
Let's not get those mixed up.

06:52.370 --> 06:53.830
We'll take the stuff
back to the hideout.

06:54.330 --> 06:55.630
You guys have a hideout?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
You want to see it?

06:57.090 --> 06:58.090
Yes, we want to see it!

07:02.180 --> 07:03.260

07:03.470 --> 07:04.970
Where? There's nothing here.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.220
Hold this.

07:06.310 --> 07:07.510
Why? What's this do?

07:07.760 --> 07:09.470
Aah!

07:09.560 --> 07:10.600
Aang?

07:10.680 --> 07:11.850
I'll get up on my own.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.320
Grab hold of me, Katara.

07:31.460 --> 07:32.830
Nice place you got!

07:39.250 --> 07:40.630
It's beautiful up here.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.840
It's beautiful, and more importantly,

07:42.930 --> 07:44.470
the Fire Nation can't find us.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.220
They would love to find you,

07:46.300 --> 07:47.600
wouldn't they, Jet?

07:47.680 --> 07:49.390
It's not going to happen, Smellerbee.

07:49.680 --> 07:51.520
KATARA: Why does the Fire Nation
want to find you?

07:51.600 --> 07:52.980
JET: I guess you could say

07:53.060 --> 07:54.560
I've been causing them
a little trouble.

07:54.650 --> 07:56.690
See, they took over a nearby
Earth Kingdom town

07:56.770 --> 07:57.770
a few years back.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.440
We've been ambushing their troops,

07:59.520 --> 08:01.110
cutting off their supply lines,

08:01.190 --> 08:03.570
and doing anything we can
to mess with them.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.410
One day, we'll drive the Fire Nation

08:05.490 --> 08:06.490
out of here for good,

08:06.570 --> 08:07.570
And free that town.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.450
That's so brave.

08:09.530 --> 08:12.290
Yeah, nothing's braver
than a guy in a tree house.

08:12.580 --> 08:14.250
Don't pay any attention to my brother.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.750
No problem. He probably
had a rough day.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.380
So, you all live here?

08:18.460 --> 08:19.460
That's right.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.920
Longshot over there,

08:21.210 --> 08:23.420
His town got burned down
by the Fire Nation.

08:23.630 --> 08:25.550
And we found The Duke
trying to steal our food.

08:26.090 --> 08:27.930
I don't think he ever
really had a home.

08:28.260 --> 08:29.510
What about you?

08:31.390 --> 08:32.980
The Fire Nation killed my parents.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.560
I was only eight years old.

08:35.940 --> 08:37.650
That day changed me forever.

08:37.730 --> 08:40.650
Sokka and I lost our mother
to the Fire Nation.

from the look on one soldier's face,

when The Duke dropped down
on his helmet

and rode him like a wild hog-monkey!

about a couple of kids
hiding in the trees.

that you and Aang
can help in our struggle.

11:36.700 --> 11:38.870
( LAUGHING )

11:38.950 --> 11:41.080
Sokka, look what The Duke gave me.

11:44.290 --> 11:45.960
( HISSES )

11:48.460 --> 11:50.010
Ow, quit it!

11:50.670 --> 11:52.470
Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back?

11:52.840 --> 11:54.550
Yeah, he's back. But we're leaving.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.720
What?

11:55.800 --> 11:57.510
But I made him this hat.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.970
Your boyfriend Jet's a thug.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.060
What?!

12:01.140 --> 12:02.350
No, he's not.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.060
He's messed up, Katara.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.270
AANG: He's not messed up.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.020
He's just got a different way of life.

12:07.110 --> 12:08.570
A really fun way of life.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.030
He beat and robbed

12:10.110 --> 12:11.280
a harmless old man.

12:12.070 --> 12:14.280
I want to hear
Jet's side of the story.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.740
Sokka, you told them what happened,

12:16.820 --> 12:19.280
but you didn't mention
that the guy was Fire Nation?

12:19.370 --> 12:21.910
No, he conveniently
left that part out.

12:22.370 --> 12:24.210
Fine, but even if he was Fire Nation,

12:24.290 --> 12:25.580
he was a harmless civilian.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.210
He was an assassin, Sokka.

12:30.130 --> 12:32.840
See? There's a compartment
for poison in the knife.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.420
He was sent to eliminate me.

12:34.510 --> 12:36.430
You helped save my life, Sokka.

12:36.760 --> 12:38.390
I knew there was an explanation.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.180
I didn't see any knife.

12:40.640 --> 12:42.060
That's because he was concealing it.

12:42.140 --> 12:43.640
See, Sokka?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.850
I'm sure you just
didn't notice the knife.

12:45.940 --> 12:47.650
There was no knife!

12:47.850 --> 12:49.020
I'm going back to the hut

12:49.110 --> 12:50.440
and packing my things.

12:51.360 --> 12:52.860
Tell me you guys aren't leaving yet.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.400
I really need your help.

12:54.490 --> 12:55.530
What can we do?

12:55.900 --> 12:57.990
The Fire Nation is planning
on burning down our forest.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.330
If you both use waterbending
to fill the reservoir,

13:00.410 --> 13:01.700
we could fight the fires.

13:02.080 --> 13:03.330
But if you leave now,

13:03.410 --> 13:05.040
they'll destroy the whole valley.

13:09.210 --> 13:10.500
We can't leave now

13:10.590 --> 13:12.880
with the Fire Nation
about to burn down a forest!

13:12.960 --> 13:14.380
I'm sorry, Katara.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.470
Jet's very smooth,
but we can't trust him.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.470
You know what I think?

13:18.550 --> 13:21.260
You're jealous that he's a better
warrior and a better leader.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.520
Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.720
It's just that my instincts―

13:24.810 --> 13:26.390
Well, my instincts tell me

13:26.480 --> 13:28.560
we need to stay here a little longer
and help Jet.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.230
Come on, Aang.

13:30.650 --> 13:31.650
Sorry, Sokka.

13:34.650 --> 13:36.070
( SNORING )

13:41.950 --> 13:42.950
JET: Let's go.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.040
Huh?

14:05.640 --> 14:06.770
Now listen.

14:06.850 --> 14:08.980
You're not to blow the dam
until I give the signal.

14:09.060 --> 14:10.770
If the reservoir isn't full,

14:10.850 --> 14:12.650
the Fire Nation troops could survive.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.110
But what about the people in the town?

14:15.190 --> 14:17.030
Won't they get wiped out, too?

14:17.240 --> 14:18.780
Look, Duke, that's the price

14:18.860 --> 14:20.860
of ridding this area
of the Fire Nation.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.740
Now don't blow the dam
until I give the signal.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.830
Got it?

14:25.330 --> 14:26.540
( RUSTLING )

14:26.950 --> 14:28.080
Ow!

14:28.580 --> 14:31.250
Where do you think
you're going, ponytail?

14:36.590 --> 14:37.670
JET: Sokka.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.920
I'm glad you decided to join us.

14:40.930 --> 14:43.510
I heard your plan
to destroy the Earth Kingdom town.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.010
Our plan is to rid the valley
of the Fire Nation.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.810
There are people living there, Jet,

14:47.890 --> 14:49.640
mothers and fathers and children.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.730
We can't win without
making some sacrifices.

14:52.810 --> 14:55.110
You lied to Aang and Katara
about the forest fire.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.440
Because they don't understand
the demands of war.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.940
Not like you and I do.

14:59.150 --> 15:00.490
I do understand.

15:00.570 --> 15:02.070
I understand that
there's nothing you won't do

15:02.160 --> 15:03.320
to get what you want.

15:03.910 --> 15:06.120
I was hoping you'd have an open mind.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.080
But I can see you've made your choice.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.000
I can't let you warn Katara and Aang.

15:12.080 --> 15:13.330
Take him for a walk.

15:13.540 --> 15:14.670
A long walk.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.500
You can't do this!

15:16.590 --> 15:17.920
Cheer up, Sokka.

15:18.210 --> 15:19.670
We're going to win a great victory

15:19.760 --> 15:20.880
against the Fire Nation today.

15:24.140 --> 15:26.890
KATARA: Jet, I'm sorry about how
Sokka's been acting.

15:26.970 --> 15:29.350
No worries. He already apologized.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.940
Really? Sokka apologized?

15:32.310 --> 15:33.900
Yeah, I was surprised, too.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.690
I got the sense that maybe you

15:35.770 --> 15:36.770
Talked to him or something.

15:36.860 --> 15:37.980
Yeah, I did.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.730
I guess something you said
got through to him.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.070
Anyhow, he went out
on a scouting mission

15:42.150 --> 15:43.780
with Pipsqueak and Smellerbee.

15:43.860 --> 15:44.950
I'm glad he cooled off.

15:45.280 --> 15:46.990
He's so stubborn sometimes.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.080
Uhh!

15:49.040 --> 15:50.290
All right, we're here.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.580
Underground water's trying
to escape from these vents.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.670
I need you guys to help it along.

15:54.960 --> 15:57.750
I've never used bending
on water I can't see.

15:57.840 --> 15:59.210
I don't know...

15:59.420 --> 16:01.880
Katara, you can do this.

16:02.090 --> 16:03.380
What about me?

16:03.590 --> 16:05.550
I know the Avatar can do this.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.740
JET: Yes! Good job.

16:28.990 --> 16:30.580
This river empties into the reservoir.

16:30.660 --> 16:32.370
A few more geysers
and it will be full.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.040
Look, there's another steam vent.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.880
Ok, you two keep it up,

16:37.960 --> 16:39.460
I'll go check on things
at the reservoir.

16:41.170 --> 16:42.960
KATARA: When we're done,
we'll meet you over there.

16:43.050 --> 16:45.180
Actually, probably better
if you meet me

16:45.260 --> 16:46.550
back at the hideout when you're done.

16:57.060 --> 16:58.520
I bet that's enough.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.060
And I'm not just
saying that to be lazy.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.190
Let's catch up with Jet
at the reservoir.

17:02.570 --> 17:04.530
I thought we agreed
to meet Jet back at the hideout.

17:04.610 --> 17:06.150
Well, we finished early.

17:06.570 --> 17:07.910
I'm sure he'll be happy to see us.

17:11.120 --> 17:13.160
Come on, move along!

17:13.240 --> 17:14.790
How can you stand by and do nothing

17:14.870 --> 17:16.710
while Jet wipes out a whole town?

17:17.040 --> 17:19.330
Hey, listen, Sokka,
Jet's a great leader.

17:19.420 --> 17:23.090
We follow what he says,
and things always turn out ok.

17:27.720 --> 17:29.340
If that's how Jet leads,

17:29.760 --> 17:30.930
Then he's got a lot to learn!

17:31.010 --> 17:32.010
Hey!

17:34.020 --> 17:35.020
Unh!

17:36.310 --> 17:37.520
While you two are up there,

17:37.600 --> 17:39.690
you might want to practice
your knot work.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.150
Hey, Smellerbee.

17:42.230 --> 17:44.150
You going to eat your lychee nuts?

17:44.230 --> 17:45.360
Ooh.

17:52.530 --> 17:53.620
What are they doing?

17:53.700 --> 17:55.080
Hey, those are the red barrels

17:55.160 --> 17:56.330
he got from the Fire Nation.

17:56.580 --> 17:58.370
Why would they need blasting jelly?

17:58.960 --> 18:01.040
Because Jet's going to
blow up the dam.

18:01.460 --> 18:02.460
What?

18:02.540 --> 18:04.340
No, that would destroy the town.

18:04.420 --> 18:06.010
Jet wouldn't do that.

18:06.090 --> 18:07.630
I've got to stop him!

18:08.130 --> 18:09.430
Jet wouldn't do that.

18:09.930 --> 18:10.970
Unh!

18:12.600 --> 18:13.640
Yes, I would.

18:13.720 --> 18:14.970
Jet, why?

18:15.060 --> 18:17.600
Katara, you would, too,
if you just stop to think.

18:18.270 --> 18:20.900
Think about what the Fire Nation
did to your mother.

18:20.980 --> 18:23.520
We can't let them do that
to anyone else ever again.

18:23.820 --> 18:25.530
This isn't the answer.

18:25.610 --> 18:27.780
I want you to understand me, Katara.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.320
I thought your brother
would understand, but―

18:30.700 --> 18:32.240
Where's Sokka?

18:32.320 --> 18:33.320
Katara.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.410
Unh!

18:40.160 --> 18:41.290
I need to get to the dam.

18:43.250 --> 18:45.210
You're not going anywhere
without your glider.

18:45.300 --> 18:46.710
Unh! Uhh! Unh!

18:48.840 --> 18:50.260
I'm not going to fight you, Jet.

18:50.340 --> 18:52.220
You'll have to
if you want your glider back.

19:01.390 --> 19:02.400
Hah!

19:06.190 --> 19:07.190
Unh!

Unh!

Why, Jet?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.200
I can't believe I trusted you.

20:34.740 --> 20:36.030
You lied to me!

20:36.110 --> 20:38.070
You're sick, and I trusted you!

20:47.330 --> 20:48.330
No!

20:51.590 --> 20:52.760
Unh!

20:54.220 --> 20:55.550
Sokka's still out there.

20:55.760 --> 20:57.340
He's our only chance.

20:57.430 --> 20:59.100
Come on, Sokka.

20:59.430 --> 21:01.100
I'm sorry I ever doubted you.

21:01.180 --> 21:02.180
Please...

21:09.770 --> 21:10.860
No.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.170
Sokka didn't make it in time.

All those people.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.130
Jet, you monster!

21:36.220 --> 21:37.840
This was a victory, Katara.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.090
Remember that.

21:39.180 --> 21:40.550
The Fire Nation is gone,

21:40.640 --> 21:41.720
and this valley will be safe.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.430
SOKKA: It will be safe,

21:43.510 --> 21:45.270
without you.

21:46.020 --> 21:47.020
Sokka!

21:47.230 --> 21:48.600
I warned the villagers of your plan,

21:48.690 --> 21:49.690
Just in time.

21:49.770 --> 21:52.110
- What?!
- At first, they didn't believe me.

21:52.190 --> 21:54.780
The Fire Nation soldiers
assumed I was a spy.

21:54.860 --> 21:56.150
But one man vouched for me,

21:56.240 --> 21:58.280
the old man you attacked.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.490
He urged them to trust me,
and we got everyone out in time.

22:06.830 --> 22:08.830
Mrs. Pretty!

22:09.580 --> 22:10.960
Sokka, you fool!

22:11.040 --> 22:12.130
We could have freed this valley!

22:12.210 --> 22:13.380
Who would be free?

22:13.750 --> 22:14.880
Everyone would be dead.

22:15.340 --> 22:16.340
You traitor!

22:16.420 --> 22:18.220
No, Jet. You became the traitor

22:18.300 --> 22:20.180
when you stopped
protecting innocent people.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.100
Katara, please, help me.

22:23.350 --> 22:24.850
Good-bye, Jet.

you were going to the dam.

How come you went to the town instead?

Let me guess.

Your instincts told you.

Hey, sometimes they're right.

You know we're going
the wrong way, right?
