00:02.877 --> 00:04.754
- Previously, on  The Way Home

00:04.796 --> 00:06.673
- Oh, Nick, this is Alice.

00:06.715 --> 00:08.425
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:08.466 --> 00:10.760
- Someone tells me Monica wants
you to give me your number.

00:10.802 --> 00:12.846
- I was the one who told
those stories about the boat.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.556
- You need to stay out
of my business.

00:14.597 --> 00:16.766
By the way,
I'm not selling the boat.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.435
You need to fix it up.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.104
Why don't you trust
your daughter?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.440
(intriguing music)

00:25.483 --> 00:27.193
- Alice!

00:34.743 --> 00:36.703
(**)

00:36.745 --> 00:39.080
(birds chirping)

00:44.711 --> 00:46.379
(inaudible screaming)

00:46.421 --> 00:48.381
(indistinct conversations
from the past)

00:48.423 --> 00:50.842
- Keep your eye on the ball.
- Do you need some help?

00:50.884 --> 00:52.344
- Say cheese!

00:52.385 --> 00:53.803
(laughter)

00:56.848 --> 00:59.351
(tense music)

01:03.063 --> 01:05.357

01:06.733 --> 01:09.235

01:11.154 --> 01:14.449
(panting)

01:24.334 --> 01:26.586
(dog barking in distance)

01:26.628 --> 01:29.714
(soft ukulele music)

01:43.311 --> 01:46.564
Oh, thank God. Alice.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.817
- Alice! Hey.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.571
(sing together)

01:53.613 --> 01:55.532
* New Kids On The Block
had a bunch of hits *

01:55.573 --> 01:57.534
* Chinese food makes me sick *

01:57.575 --> 01:59.494
* And I think it's fly
when girls stop by *

01:59.536 --> 02:02.288
* For the summer
for the summer *

02:02.330 --> 02:05.542
* I like girls that wear
Abercrombie & Fitch *

02:05.583 --> 02:07.752
* I'd take her
if I had one wish *

02:07.794 --> 02:10.130
* But she's been gone
since that summer *

02:10.171 --> 02:11.923
* Since that summer *

02:11.965 --> 02:14.134
* Hip Hop, marmalade
spic and span *

02:14.175 --> 02:16.636
* Met you one summer
and it all began *

02:16.678 --> 02:19.180
* You're the best girl
that I ever did see *

02:19.222 --> 02:21.641
* The great Larry Bird
Jersey 33 **

02:21.683 --> 02:23.351
(laughing)

02:24.686 --> 02:26.688
- Ah, summer went by
way too fast.

02:26.730 --> 02:29.315
- Ugh, tell me about it.

02:29.357 --> 02:31.776
- So, what's up with Nick, huh?

02:31.818 --> 02:33.820
Have you talked to him since?

02:33.862 --> 02:35.572
- No, actually...

02:35.613 --> 02:39.159
Honestly, I don't even know
if it's really a thing.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.952
- Do you want it to be a thing?

02:40.994 --> 02:42.537
- I don't think it's just
up to me.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.998
- Oh, I saw you guys.
He's into it.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.875
(laughing)

02:46.916 --> 02:49.336
Now, ask if I have any news.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.088
- Okay, Kat,
do you have any news?

02:52.130 --> 02:53.757
- I do.
(laughs)

02:53.798 --> 02:55.008
Brady's coming this weekend.

02:55.050 --> 02:58.136
- Wait... like...
"Brady", Brady?

02:58.178 --> 02:59.888
I thought you were
keeping him a secret?

02:59.929 --> 03:02.057
- I was. Until Mom caught me

03:02.098 --> 03:04.434
talking to him
on the phone at 2 AM.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.020
- So, she's letting him
come visit?

03:07.062 --> 03:08.438
- Well, Dad is.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.107
He says that preventing me
from seeing him

03:11.149 --> 03:13.151
is only gonna drive me
away from them.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.196
So, Brady's coming this weekend
for an official introduction.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.614
(chuckles)

03:17.655 --> 03:19.449
He's staying at
the Port Haven Inn, though.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.743
I've tried for the couch,
but Mom was all like,

03:21.785 --> 03:23.203
"Not a chance!

03:23.244 --> 03:24.829
I was born at night,
but not last night!"

03:24.871 --> 03:26.039
(laughing)

03:26.081 --> 03:28.166
Do you think you're gonna
be here then?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.418
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
I'll definitely try.

03:31.711 --> 03:34.422
- Wait.
There's something on your back,

03:34.464 --> 03:36.800
like a bug or something.
- Ew, get it off! Get it off!

03:36.841 --> 03:38.009
- I can't! It keeps moving.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.344
(laughing)

03:39.386 --> 03:41.721
- You did not just do that!

03:41.763 --> 03:43.056
- Truce!

03:43.098 --> 03:44.891
I need to get back.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.226
You wanna stay for dinner?

03:46.267 --> 03:47.727
- I can't. I have to get going,

03:47.769 --> 03:49.896
but I'll definitely try
and be here for Brady, though.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.815
- Okay. See ya!

03:51.856 --> 03:53.733
- See ya.
(chuckles)

03:55.735 --> 03:57.946
(soft music)

04:02.992 --> 04:05.662
(insects and birds chirping)

04:17.298 --> 04:18.758
(sighing)

04:21.177 --> 04:22.762
(boy giggles)

04:22.804 --> 04:25.015
(footsteps pattering)

04:30.145 --> 04:32.564
(**)

04:47.829 --> 04:49.330
- Hey, there you are!

04:50.999 --> 04:52.625
Ready to practice?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.294
- Yeah, I sure am.
- Alright.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.628
Now remember, keep your eye
on the ball.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.297
(gasps)

04:57.339 --> 04:59.049
Sorry, bud.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.133
(chuckling)
- I missed it.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.344
- You did!
- Again.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.387
- Alright.
Show me what you got.

05:04.429 --> 05:06.723
- This one.
- Oof!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.558
Man, where did you learn
how to throw so hard?

05:08.600 --> 05:12.020
- Uh... I don't know!

05:12.062 --> 05:13.355
- There you go.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.148
Here's a high one!
Oh, move your feet!

05:15.190 --> 05:17.567
Move your feet!
Ah! Good hustle.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.194
- That was a high ball!

05:19.235 --> 05:21.112
- That was a high ball.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.157
(sobbing)

05:24.199 --> 05:26.576
(**)

05:28.495 --> 05:30.872
(birds chirping)

05:32.248 --> 05:33.875
- Afternoon, Old Miss!

05:33.917 --> 05:35.502
How are you doing?

05:37.128 --> 05:38.922
You know, I went through
labour twice

05:38.963 --> 05:40.840
and that was enough for me.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.843
And here you are about to have
calf number four.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.888
I think that deserves
a private suite.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.556
What do you think?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.227
- I understand why Del's making
you clean it up,

05:52.268 --> 05:54.854
but how did I get
roped into this?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.815
- Del says you know boats,
so you can file a complaint

05:56.856 --> 05:59.526
with her if you'd like.
- I'm smarter than that.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.069
You know what's cool?

06:01.111 --> 06:05.156
Boats are a perfect example
of Newton's third law.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.701
For every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

06:07.742 --> 06:10.203
The propeller pushes
the water backwards,

06:10.245 --> 06:13.456
thus the boat moves forward.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.418
- You have a very weird
definition of what's cool.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.130
- Clean.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.430
- What was my dad like
as a teenager?

06:29.431 --> 06:31.391
- Uh... I don't know.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.643
He wasn't from around here.

06:33.685 --> 06:36.604
- Yeah, but he visited Mom
when they were dating, right?

06:36.646 --> 06:38.565
In '99?

06:38.606 --> 06:40.567
- You just time-travelled,
didn't you?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.320
- So? Did you meet him?

06:44.362 --> 06:47.407
- I did.
But that was about it.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.368
It was the Captain Brady show
back then.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.454
- Did I meet him?

06:53.121 --> 06:55.123
- Yes.

06:55.165 --> 06:56.958
Look, you know I can't tell
you when to go back,

06:57.000 --> 06:58.460
right, to see him?

06:58.501 --> 07:00.754
I know when you were there,
not when you leave.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.757
- You really can't tell me
anything about him?

07:03.798 --> 07:06.176
- Even if I could,
it wouldn't matter.

07:06.217 --> 07:08.386
It's not 1999 anymore

07:08.428 --> 07:09.929
People change.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.473
- You didn't.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.225
- Wow! You're really doing it.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.436
- I'm a woman of my word.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.105
- You're also a woman
with a mess.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.524
- I'm gonna make dinner
while you clean this up.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.068
- I'm all over it.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.695
Come on, Finn!
(clicking tongue)

07:25.737 --> 07:28.615
- Oh, you are happy that
they're here, Del.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.034
- Convincing yourself?
- Reminding.

07:31.076 --> 07:32.535
And it's not just Alice.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.828
When Kat makes eggs,

07:33.870 --> 07:35.955
she puts the shells
back in the carton.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.290
It's madness.

07:37.332 --> 07:39.501
I should just stay out
in the field with the cow.

07:39.542 --> 07:41.127
It's calmer.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.754
(chuckling)

07:43.213 --> 07:44.923
I would invite you for dinner...

07:44.964 --> 07:47.801
but no one can see
my kitchen right now.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.470
- That bad, huh?
- Afraid so.

07:50.512 --> 07:52.722
Besides, Kat's not
gonna be there.

07:52.764 --> 07:55.475
She's uh...
off riding, I think.

07:55.517 --> 07:58.061
- Oh. That's not...

07:58.103 --> 08:00.480
- Some advice:

08:00.522 --> 08:02.524
play the long game.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.485
(soft music)

08:05.527 --> 08:07.654
(indistinct conversation)

08:11.491 --> 08:13.868
(laughing)

08:19.207 --> 08:20.875
- Say cheese!

08:21.960 --> 08:23.211
Perfect!

08:24.087 --> 08:25.380
(laughing)

08:25.422 --> 08:27.048
- You got it?
- Yep!

08:29.426 --> 08:30.802
(sighs)

08:31.761 --> 08:33.221
- Ugh...

08:34.764 --> 08:36.182
Alice!

08:37.726 --> 08:40.562
- Oh, I'm starving,
thank you for dinner.

08:40.603 --> 08:42.856
- Well, enjoy it.

08:42.897 --> 08:45.025
Because tomorrow, I'm not gonna
have time for meal planning.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.735
I've gotta get Old Miss
in the barn

08:46.776 --> 08:48.111
before the vet gets here,

08:48.153 --> 08:51.656
plus there's winter garden prep,
and of course,

08:51.698 --> 08:52.991
Lobster Social.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.701
- Yeah, I've been seeing
posters of that

08:54.743 --> 08:56.828
all over in town.
What is it?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.205
Like a Coachella
for crabs or something?

08:59.247 --> 09:00.790
(scoffs)

09:01.416 --> 09:03.126
Yeah, never mind.

09:03.168 --> 09:06.129
- Well, Lobster Social
is a celebration

09:06.171 --> 09:07.339
of our fishing industry.

09:07.380 --> 09:11.259
We have lobster rolls
and lemonade...

09:11.301 --> 09:14.137
It's fun and you should go.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.097
- Oh, uh, actually, I can't.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.767
I have plans tomorrow
to meet someone.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.478
- Okay, just know I'm busy

09:21.519 --> 09:23.271
and I need you and your mother
to keep things

09:23.313 --> 09:25.357
in better order around here.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.609
If you do a good job,
who knows,

09:27.650 --> 09:30.653
Rita and I might take you
to Burning Man next year.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.700
(chuckles)

09:35.742 --> 09:38.370
- I almost forgot,
I saw that dog again!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.414
- Jake, we get it.
You want a dog!

09:41.456 --> 09:43.875
- Look, I found his toy
in the field.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.835
- Honey, get that dirty
thing off the table.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.754
- Okay, I think it's time
to do the dishes, guys.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.339
- I don't like dishes.

09:49.381 --> 09:50.882
Pigs don't have to do dishes.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.676
- You're not a pig!
- Argh!

09:52.717 --> 09:54.386
(indistinct chatter, laughing)

09:58.682 --> 10:00.308
(clattering)

10:02.394 --> 10:03.770
- Who's there?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.107
- Oh no.
- Wait.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.316
Stop.

10:09.401 --> 10:10.610
(sighs)

10:10.652 --> 10:12.362
(soft music)

10:13.613 --> 10:15.031
Are you okay, ma'am?

10:16.157 --> 10:17.659
Do you need some help?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.495
- Uh...

10:20.537 --> 10:22.622
I'm so sorry.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.332
I should... I shouldn't be here.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.251
I-I'm sorry.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.836
- Ma'am?

10:38.430 --> 10:41.182
(sobbing)

10:42.183 --> 10:44.019

(sobbing)

11:12.213 --> 11:14.299
(birds chirping)

11:20.430 --> 11:22.349
- Where are you off to so early?

11:22.390 --> 11:24.225
- Meeting friends.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.685
Have you seen mom?

11:25.727 --> 11:27.437
Didn't even hear her
come in last night.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.940
- She's been like that
for ten minutes.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.403
If she keeps it up,
I can sell the scarecrow.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.118
- Mom.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.370
You okay?

11:43.411 --> 11:44.579
(sighing)

11:44.621 --> 11:46.081
- I love you.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.292
- Uh...

11:49.334 --> 11:50.794
I love you too?

11:52.754 --> 11:55.590
- Katherine!
We need to get going.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.133
- What? Where?

11:57.175 --> 11:59.678
- The Point!
I gotta deliver these tables!

11:59.719 --> 12:02.138
(sighing)
And don't you have to work?

12:02.681 --> 12:05.850
- Byron asked me
to interview Monica

12:05.892 --> 12:07.769
at the Lobster Social thing,
but I...

12:07.811 --> 12:09.771
I wanted to spend
the day with you.

12:09.813 --> 12:14.150
I-I think we really need
some time... to talk.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.904
Hey, you know what?
Come with me.

12:18.446 --> 12:20.240
What do you say?

12:20.281 --> 12:23.201
- Sorry. I have plans.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.744
- What plans?

12:24.786 --> 12:25.870
Hey, just...

12:25.912 --> 12:27.914
stay with me today. Please?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.083
Here, now.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.793
Great. I'll change my clothes.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.005
(upbeat music)

12:38.758 --> 12:40.593
- Welcome. Welcome.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.762
I'm ready for my closeup,
Miss Landry.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.556
So, where do you want me?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
- Actually, I...
If it's cool with you,

12:47.225 --> 12:49.602
Alice and I were gonna spend
a little time together first.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.396
- See? Told you
she'd come around.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.523
- Yeah.
- Well, say no more.

12:53.565 --> 12:55.191
Just find me later.
- Okay.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.736
So...

12:57.777 --> 13:00.447
Do you wanna grab a roll,

13:00.488 --> 13:02.323
or tear into a claw, or...

13:02.365 --> 13:03.742
- Don't you have to work?

13:03.783 --> 13:05.660
- It can wait. It can wait.

13:05.702 --> 13:07.620
This... us...

13:07.662 --> 13:10.623
You, me, this is more important.

13:10.665 --> 13:12.083
So, just talk to me.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.128
Not like a mom.
Talk to me like a friend, okay?

13:15.170 --> 13:16.796
What's going on
in your life right now?

13:16.838 --> 13:18.548
Are you happy here?

13:18.590 --> 13:21.426
- Yeah. Yeah,
school's good and...

13:21.468 --> 13:23.470
the farm's cool.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.096
- And... friends?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.973
Have you... have you made any?

13:27.015 --> 13:30.018
- I have. One.
A good one, actually.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.271
- That is so great.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.939
You know, to find somebody
who really gets you,

13:34.981 --> 13:38.485
just crack you open
and gets you out of your shell.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.570
- Heavy on the lobster metaphor,

13:40.612 --> 13:43.573
but yeah, it's been really nice.

13:43.615 --> 13:45.867
- Good.
- I just don't know how much

13:45.909 --> 13:48.787
time I'll have with her,
you know?

13:48.828 --> 13:51.664
People and friends...

13:51.706 --> 13:53.249
they can change.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.502
- Hey, Kat, Alice.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.420
- Hi.
- You made it.

13:57.462 --> 14:01.341
- Well, my real plans were
forcibly cancelled. So...

14:01.383 --> 14:02.801
I'll go get us drinks.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.887
- Yes. Lemonade and lobster
would be perfect.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.223
(sighs)

14:09.557 --> 14:11.518
- Rough night?
- Yeah.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.687
Yeah, you could say that.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.230
It's like...

14:15.271 --> 14:17.440
one of those nights where, um...

14:17.482 --> 14:19.776
nothing is as it seems

14:19.818 --> 14:22.862
and you find yourself
just redefining your...

14:22.904 --> 14:24.698
your whole world. You know?

14:24.739 --> 14:28.118
You ever have one of those?
- Uh... maybe?

14:28.952 --> 14:32.122
- I think I can really
reconnect with Alice.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.416
We have something in common

14:34.457 --> 14:36.626
that I didn't really
know about before.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.961
Um...

14:38.003 --> 14:39.546
I feel like we could really...

14:39.587 --> 14:42.298
really be best friends--

14:44.759 --> 14:46.469
Where did she go?

14:47.262 --> 14:49.514
- I think your new best friend
may have ditched you.

14:49.556 --> 14:51.182
(sighs)

14:54.644 --> 14:56.021
(birds chirping)

14:56.062 --> 14:58.231
(indistinct chatter)

15:00.233 --> 15:02.694
- Dhawan!
The Lobster's that way.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.612
- Uh... yeah. I was...

15:04.654 --> 15:07.615
I was just there, actually.
My mom kinda made me, so...

15:07.657 --> 15:09.200
- Yeah. That tracks.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.579
- Hey, um...

15:12.620 --> 15:14.122
About your birthday...

15:14.998 --> 15:17.834
I... didn't really
eat bad chicken.

15:17.876 --> 15:19.252
I wasn't sick.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.129
I just didn't come to your party

15:21.171 --> 15:23.298
because I'm really bad
at being the new kid.

15:23.340 --> 15:24.549
Sorry.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.676
- It's okay. I figured.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.637
The caf isn't even allowed
to serve chicken anymore.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.514
(chuckling)

15:31.556 --> 15:34.142
My friends are waiting on me.
You want to join us?

15:34.184 --> 15:37.312
I'm on break from
lobster rolling, so...

15:37.354 --> 15:40.148
- Oh, I-I... have to be
somewhere, so...

15:41.232 --> 15:42.817
- Okay.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.320
- Uh, wait, uh, no,
you're right.

15:45.362 --> 15:47.989
Olive branch extended
and accepted.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.949
(laughing)

15:49.991 --> 15:51.826
- I know this must all seem
pretty lame

15:51.868 --> 15:54.037
compared to Minneapolis.

15:54.079 --> 15:56.414
Mall of America versus
Seafood on Parade.

15:56.456 --> 15:59.501
- No, I... I really
like it here.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.088
And... I didn't really do
anything in Minneapolis anyway.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.423
Just... went to school,

16:05.465 --> 16:07.425
sat at home
and played the guitar...

16:07.467 --> 16:08.510
Yeah.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.011
- Oh yeah, you play?

16:10.053 --> 16:12.847
- Yeah. Self-taught.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.683
- Hashtag
humble-brag-no-big-deal.

16:14.724 --> 16:15.850
(chuckling)

16:15.892 --> 16:18.269
(upbeat fiddle music)

16:20.230 --> 16:21.773
- Can I give you
a hand there, Del?

16:21.815 --> 16:25.193
- Oh. No, Elliot.
I don't... I don't need help.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.404
- Your comments yesterday
would suggest otherwise.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.863
- It's not about needing help,

16:28.905 --> 16:30.240
it's about getting Kat and Alice

16:30.281 --> 16:32.200
to pick up after themselves.

16:32.992 --> 16:35.036
- Yup.
- You don't wanna eat that.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.538
Let me get that out of your way.

16:36.579 --> 16:39.541
Believe you me,
those bodies are no good.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.918
- Rita!
- Oh!

16:41.960 --> 16:43.378
- Let those people eat.

16:43.420 --> 16:44.879
- Oh...

16:44.921 --> 16:46.881
So, are we over the whole

16:46.923 --> 16:48.967
"selling the boat"
nonsense, then?

16:49.009 --> 16:51.594
- Thank you for stopping
your lobster pilfering

16:51.636 --> 16:54.222
long enough to ask.
- Tourists don't eat them.

16:54.889 --> 16:56.599
- No, I'm not gonna
sell the boat.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.726
- Hmm.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.060
- So, if you're expecting a cut,

16:59.102 --> 17:00.437
you're out of luck.

17:00.478 --> 17:01.646
- I can't imagine
that old clunker

17:01.688 --> 17:03.398
would have brought in
much cash anyway.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.691
(chuckles)

17:04.733 --> 17:06.484
Oh! That's a good one.

17:07.485 --> 17:09.779
What? You weren't gonna eat it.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.824
It's for my bisque.
- Ah.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.076
- So, the whole point

17:15.118 --> 17:17.162
of throwing
the Lobster Social now

17:17.203 --> 17:20.373
is to showcase local cuisine
outside of tourist season.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.625
- Sure, yeah, no,
that makes sense.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.835
(phone buzzing)

17:23.877 --> 17:25.462
- Hmm. Spencer.

17:25.503 --> 17:26.921
He's trying to get
out of his shift

17:26.963 --> 17:28.381
to hang with his friends.

17:28.423 --> 17:30.467
Ah, and Alice, apparently.

17:30.508 --> 17:33.678
- Wait, Alice met up
with Spencer?

17:33.720 --> 17:35.388
- For real, this time.

17:35.430 --> 17:38.558
Did you find out
where she was the other night?

17:38.600 --> 17:40.310
- Uh... yeah, yeah.

17:40.352 --> 17:42.604
I, um... I did, actually.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.649
- Okay, well, I'm happy
that she's making friends.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.943
Spencer and his crew
will be good for her.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.779
I promise.
- Yeah.

17:50.820 --> 17:52.405
- Now, where was I?

17:52.447 --> 17:55.533
Port Haven,
attractive year-round.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.327
Exactly.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.120
(upbeat fiddle music)

17:59.162 --> 18:01.164
(indistinct chatter)

18:07.003 --> 18:08.421
- Need a refill?

18:09.798 --> 18:11.466
- Hi.

18:11.508 --> 18:12.967
It's uh...

18:13.009 --> 18:14.803
Oh, let me see
if I can remember.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.513
Andy. Right?

18:16.554 --> 18:18.640
- Yeah. Yeah.
I saw you wandering,

18:18.682 --> 18:20.392
I thought maybe
I could wander with you.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.686
One of those's for you,
by the way.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.315
(scoffs)

18:27.357 --> 18:29.901
- So, Monica tells me
that you are a doctor?

18:29.943 --> 18:31.319
- Yeah.
- Oh, okay.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.445
Well, I'm curious.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.948
Um... what does
the Hippocratic Oath

18:34.989 --> 18:39.327
say about not calling women
who give you their numbers?

18:39.369 --> 18:40.787
- Depends. Are we talking
about women

18:40.829 --> 18:42.330
who just gave me
their number two days ago?

18:42.372 --> 18:45.000
(gasps)
- How dare you?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.252
Are you saying that I am not

18:47.293 --> 18:51.673
a "call immediately
or lose forever" kinda gal?

18:51.715 --> 18:52.716
I mean...

18:54.467 --> 18:56.136
- Truth is, I don't
live in town.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.554
I work the whole county

18:57.595 --> 18:59.723
and it's birthing season, so...
it's been hectic.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.683
- I didn't know
there was a season for that.

19:01.725 --> 19:04.894
- Hey, when I saw you
back there, you looked. uh...

19:04.936 --> 19:07.022
lost. Everything okay?

19:07.063 --> 19:09.441
- Phew... That...

19:09.482 --> 19:12.068
is a complicated question,
doctor.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.738
- Well, care to tell me
what ails you?

19:15.238 --> 19:16.698
- Your funeral.

19:16.740 --> 19:17.824
(scoffs)

19:19.409 --> 19:21.536
My daughter has no use for me.

19:21.578 --> 19:23.288
My ex-husband is living
with a younger woman.

19:23.329 --> 19:26.166
Meanwhile, my roommate...

19:26.207 --> 19:28.126
is my mother.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.586
- Hmm.
- Yesterday, I fell into

19:29.627 --> 19:34.007
a frickin' pond
and you would not believe

19:34.049 --> 19:35.300
what is down there.

19:35.342 --> 19:38.345
I mean, I don't know.
Maybe you would?

19:38.386 --> 19:39.888
But you know what I do know?

19:39.929 --> 19:44.059
Is that you never really know
who your friends are.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.810
Or were.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.188
- Wow. Mmm.

19:48.229 --> 19:49.856
That is, um...

19:49.898 --> 19:51.524
one long list of symptoms.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.943
- Unfortunately, there's more.

19:53.985 --> 19:55.904
But I am out of wine.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.744
* We do the best we can *

20:02.786 --> 20:04.079
* While we can *

20:04.120 --> 20:06.122
* At least we try to *

20:06.164 --> 20:08.541
- Oh, I'm so sorry,
I just thought...

20:08.583 --> 20:10.085
- No, no, no, no...
No, no, no...

20:10.126 --> 20:12.754
No, no.
It's not you, it's uh...

20:12.796 --> 20:14.464
It's me. Um...

20:14.506 --> 20:18.093
I-I... I haven't kissed anybody,

20:18.134 --> 20:22.764
um, except my ex
in over, like... 20 years.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.766
So... I'm just...

20:25.809 --> 20:27.435
Just thinking...

20:31.481 --> 20:33.400
Yeah, no, we're good.
We're good.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.151
* Hey love *

20:35.193 --> 20:37.654
* I can hear it ringing **

20:42.075 --> 20:43.159
(sighing)
- There she is!

20:43.201 --> 20:44.494
- Oh, gosh.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.538
- The make-out queen
of the Lobster Social.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.165
- Oh... I don't know
what got into me last night.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.542
- Besides the wine?

20:50.583 --> 20:51.835
- Funny.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.378
- What was that about?

20:54.462 --> 20:57.340
- Honestly, I don't know.

20:57.382 --> 20:59.217
I mean...
(sighing)

20:59.259 --> 21:01.011
I was a...

21:01.052 --> 21:03.430
really weird day.

21:04.389 --> 21:06.558
God, I hope I don't run
into him.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.435
- Dr. Andy?
- Mmm.

21:08.476 --> 21:11.021
- It's a small town.
It's gonna be hard not to.

21:11.062 --> 21:12.522
(chuckles)
- Yeah.

21:13.982 --> 21:15.400
- Hey, uh...

21:15.734 --> 21:18.236
Would you pick up the tables
from The Point for me?

21:18.278 --> 21:20.363
I'd really like to stay near
Old Miss.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.032
- Tables from The Point.

21:22.073 --> 21:23.742
(clicks tongue)
Gotcha.

21:24.284 --> 21:25.785
(phone ringing)

21:30.790 --> 21:33.543
- A call from my daughter?
Well, this is a nice surprise.

21:33.585 --> 21:35.378
- Yeah, well, you are my dad,
right?

21:35.420 --> 21:36.629
Had to call you
eventually.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.340
- And a vote of confidence
to boot.

21:38.381 --> 21:40.258
Hey, I'll take it.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.426
So, how are things?

21:41.468 --> 21:43.720
- Well, your last female
roommate,

21:43.762 --> 21:46.264
AKA Mom,
is kind of losing it.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.350
- You know, go easy on your mom.

21:48.391 --> 21:51.353
We've all been going through
a lot these days.

21:51.394 --> 21:53.480
- Yeah, I know.

21:54.314 --> 21:55.565
I miss you.

21:55.607 --> 21:57.400
- Yeah, I miss you too.

21:57.442 --> 21:59.110
- Do you ever miss this place?

21:59.611 --> 22:02.864
You used to visit Mom here,
like, back in the day, right?

22:02.906 --> 22:05.033
- Yeah, I sure did.

22:05.075 --> 22:06.576
It feels like yesterday.

22:06.618 --> 22:08.411
- What were you like back then?

22:08.453 --> 22:10.121
- It was me, you know?

22:10.163 --> 22:12.123
Less mature. Same handsome.

22:12.165 --> 22:13.500
(chuckling)

22:13.541 --> 22:15.168
- Come on, Dad, I'm serious.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.628
- I'm being serious.

22:16.670 --> 22:18.463
I'm basically the same.

22:18.963 --> 22:20.256
- Mom isn't.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.926
She's... totally changed.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.262
Anyway, I should go.

22:26.304 --> 22:27.681
- Oh yeah? Big plans?

22:27.722 --> 22:29.140
- You could say that.

22:29.557 --> 22:30.934
- Thanks for the call, kiddo.

22:30.975 --> 22:31.893
- Yeah.

22:31.935 --> 22:33.186
See you soon.

22:34.479 --> 22:35.814
(phone beeps)

22:37.023 --> 22:38.358
(soft music)

22:38.400 --> 22:41.361
- Your friend Alice from '99.
- Yeah.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.446
- Well, I can't say
I do remember her,

22:43.488 --> 22:45.115
but I'm not surprised.

22:45.156 --> 22:48.493
We had tons of kids coming in
and out of the house back then.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.829
- Right, but I mean, it's Alice.
Right?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.081
We'd hang out in the field,
we'd goof off,

22:53.123 --> 22:54.332
and she'd come home for dinner.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.875
- Well, that narrows it down.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.628
Kat, do you remember
how many kids

22:58.670 --> 23:00.797
came to our house for dinner?

23:00.839 --> 23:03.842
You know, I just
don't remember her.

23:04.551 --> 23:06.970
My memories at that time are of,
uh...

23:08.054 --> 23:09.597
...more important things.

23:10.140 --> 23:11.599
- Point taken.

23:12.934 --> 23:14.561
Aw, there she is.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.396
An... Andy?

23:16.438 --> 23:17.897
- Yeah, I believe you two
have met.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.191
- Hey!

23:20.233 --> 23:22.569
So this is weird, right?

23:22.610 --> 23:25.321
- Yeah, uh, you're a vet.

23:25.363 --> 23:26.906
- Uh, yeah.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.700
- I just thought you were
a real doctor.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.119
You know, I thought that
you were um,

23:31.161 --> 23:33.413
a people doctor for...

23:33.455 --> 23:34.497
...people.

23:34.539 --> 23:37.000
- Nope. I'm an animal doctor.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.793
For animals.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.630
- Yeah. That's... That's cool.

23:42.672 --> 23:44.507
(phone ringing)
- Uh, sorry, one sec.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.051
- Uh-huh.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.970
- Hello?
- Yeah, you enjoyed that,
didn't you?

23:49.012 --> 23:50.889
- I didn't hate it.
(laughing)

23:50.930 --> 23:52.515
(Andy): Okay, yeah,
I'll be right there.

23:52.557 --> 23:54.684
Sorry, Del. I've gotta bolt.

23:54.726 --> 23:56.895
I have an emergency.
But Old Miss should be good,
though.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.105
Shouldn't be any issues,
but if there are, you know
how to reach me.

23:59.147 --> 24:01.691
- Well, I appreciate it, doc.
- You got it.

24:02.067 --> 24:04.694
And Kat, I know this was weird,
but do you want to...

24:10.325 --> 24:11.701
- Is he here?!

24:13.578 --> 24:14.496
What are you wearing?

24:14.537 --> 24:16.456
- I have work in an hour.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.583
- Like, at a job?

24:18.625 --> 24:20.710
- If that helps, yes.
I work at the theater.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.213
- Sorry, off topic. Is he here?
- Who?

24:23.254 --> 24:25.173
- My dad.

24:27.509 --> 24:30.095
- Brady's your dad?
- Uh, yeah, Brady.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.971
Hey, are you okay?

24:32.555 --> 24:34.557
- Um, yeah, I'm just...

24:35.266 --> 24:38.103
...being told the future,
so getting used to that.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.896
Yeah, he was here.

24:39.938 --> 24:42.065
Um, I met him.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.901
Kat said that he's at
the hotel

24:44.943 --> 24:46.069
getting ready
for their date.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.405
- Wait, they're going
on a date tonight?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.573
Amazing, okay. So, my next
question is

24:50.615 --> 24:52.951
how are we going
to spy on said date?

24:53.368 --> 24:55.120
- We're not, we're...

24:55.161 --> 24:56.663
I have to work.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.584
- Elliot, I could literally
watch my parents'
love story begin.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.878
And you can't be there
to pick up the piece

25:03.920 --> 25:05.588
of my brain
when it explodes?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.674
- As tempting as that sounds,
no.

25:07.716 --> 25:10.093
- Fine. You're no fun.

25:10.135 --> 25:11.386
Okay!

25:11.970 --> 25:13.346
Oh!

25:13.388 --> 25:14.681
Almost forgot.

25:14.723 --> 25:16.725
Laundry day.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.853
(soft music)

25:22.063 --> 25:24.816
- I feel like I could hurl,
I'm so excited.

25:25.567 --> 25:29.320
I mean, at camp, Brady and I
were always around the other
counselors.

25:29.362 --> 25:32.991
We were never alone.
This is like our first
official date.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.368
- I love it.
Where are you guys going?

25:35.410 --> 25:38.496
- Probably to the beach
to make out!

25:38.538 --> 25:40.331
- Get out!
(laughing)

25:42.959 --> 25:44.169
(sighs)

25:45.670 --> 25:47.672
Honestly, I'd take that.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.799
We're actually doing dinner
and a movie.

25:51.426 --> 25:52.719
You should come with us.

25:52.761 --> 25:54.888
- Uh, what? No, no, no.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.681
I don't want to be
the third wheel.

25:56.723 --> 25:59.684
- Let's call Nick.
It'd be so much fun,
like a full on double date.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.644
- A date with Nick?

26:01.686 --> 26:03.480
I don't even know if
he'd say yes.

26:03.521 --> 26:04.606
We only kissed
like one time.

26:04.647 --> 26:05.982
- I'm calling him.
- Ugh, God,

26:06.024 --> 26:07.192
you're gonna put him
on the spot!

26:07.233 --> 26:09.277
- Shh! Hey, Nick?

26:09.319 --> 26:10.570
Hi, it's Kat.

26:10.612 --> 26:12.155
- What's he saying?

26:12.197 --> 26:14.199
- Just go pick out something
to wear, he's gonna say yes.

26:14.949 --> 26:17.911
It's about tonight.
Are you free?

26:19.537 --> 26:21.706
(birds chirping)

26:23.583 --> 26:25.085
(grunts)

26:25.126 --> 26:26.795
(exhales)

26:31.341 --> 26:33.093
(**)

26:33.551 --> 26:35.387
(cow mooing)

26:37.138 --> 26:38.848
- What's going on?

26:41.393 --> 26:42.644
Oh gosh.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.562
Okay, okay. Hold on.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.106
Hold on.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.401
(mooing)

26:49.442 --> 26:51.903
- You've reached Dr. Stafford,
please leave a message.

26:53.405 --> 26:54.906
(sighs)

26:56.241 --> 26:57.492
(mooing)

26:57.867 --> 26:59.452
- It's alright, girl.

27:01.246 --> 27:03.248
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.459
(light music playing)

27:10.255 --> 27:11.756
(sighs)

27:12.090 --> 27:13.133
- Hey!

27:16.386 --> 27:18.930
Wow. You look incredible.

27:18.972 --> 27:22.350
Like an Aerosmith music video.

27:22.392 --> 27:24.686
(chuckles)
- Dream on.

27:24.728 --> 27:26.980
- Good reference. You a fan?

27:27.022 --> 27:30.358
- Uh, no. My mom was. Or is?
I mean--

27:30.400 --> 27:32.402
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I love Aerosmith too,

27:32.444 --> 27:36.406
but my date doesn't start
until Brady "Walks This Way"
in here, so...

27:36.448 --> 27:37.574
(bells on door ringing)

27:37.615 --> 27:38.825
He's here.

27:39.993 --> 27:40.994
Brades!

27:41.619 --> 27:43.038
- Hey, baby.

27:45.415 --> 27:47.500
Mmm, you clean up nice.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.753
- Thank you.

27:49.794 --> 27:51.629
So, change of plans,

27:51.671 --> 27:53.757
these are my friends
Nick and Alice,

27:53.798 --> 27:55.550
and they're gonna join us
tonight.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.595
- But I thought it was just
gonna be us tonight.

27:58.636 --> 28:00.180
Like... special.

28:00.221 --> 28:02.432
- I-I know, but this is okay,
right?

28:02.474 --> 28:04.934
I mean, we're still together.
It'll be fun.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.520
- Sure. Not like it's gonna be
a romantic date

28:07.562 --> 28:09.064
in a place like
this anyway, right?

28:09.105 --> 28:10.523
(laughing)

28:10.565 --> 28:12.525
Welcome to Port Haven.

28:12.567 --> 28:13.902
(Brady chuckles)

28:13.943 --> 28:15.653
- He seems...

28:15.695 --> 28:17.155
...nice?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.287
(insects chirping)

28:24.329 --> 28:26.081
(soft music)

28:29.709 --> 28:31.336
- Kat, where are you?

28:32.337 --> 28:33.630
Pick up!

28:33.672 --> 28:34.631
(thunder rumbling)

28:34.673 --> 28:36.091
Ugh!

28:36.508 --> 28:37.801
(mooing)

28:37.842 --> 28:39.302
(exhales deeply)

28:41.304 --> 28:42.472
- Got your message.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.517
(mooing)
What's wrong?

28:45.558 --> 28:47.352
- I need your help.

28:54.693 --> 28:56.194
For yourself?

28:56.236 --> 28:58.613
- Just a half glass
of your house white.

28:58.655 --> 29:01.616
- Uh, may I ask you for some ID?

29:11.334 --> 29:14.004
Sorry, I can't accept this.

29:15.255 --> 29:17.257
- What do you mean? Why?

29:17.716 --> 29:18.675
- It's a fake.

29:19.843 --> 29:21.761
May I recommend a Shirley Temple
instead?

29:24.014 --> 29:26.141
- Coke is fine.
(chuckles)

29:27.100 --> 29:28.393
- Never happens back home.

29:28.435 --> 29:30.311
Guess I shouldn't expect
the same in the sticks.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.646
(Kat laughs)

29:32.981 --> 29:34.983
- So, you grew up
in Minneapolis, right?

29:35.358 --> 29:37.485
- You got it. The better half
of the Twin Cities.

29:37.527 --> 29:39.696
- And you go to school in Maine?
What's that about?

29:39.738 --> 29:41.448
Are you following your hopes
and dreams? And...

29:41.489 --> 29:43.742
What are your hopes and dreams,
like right now?

29:45.118 --> 29:47.746
- That was... aggressive.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.247
(laughing)
- It's okay.

29:49.289 --> 29:51.458
I'm an open book.
You want to know my blood type?

29:51.499 --> 29:53.543
AB. Super rare.

29:55.211 --> 29:57.172
No, Mom and Dad didn't want me
to go to Maine Prep.

29:57.213 --> 30:00.383
They tried to send me
to Harvard-Westlake in Cali.

30:00.967 --> 30:03.094
But LA, it's so pretentious,
man.

30:03.136 --> 30:04.888
It was so fake.

30:05.513 --> 30:07.932
But I wanted to stay grounded,
so here I am,

30:07.974 --> 30:10.685
two years later
with a 3.8 GPA,

30:10.727 --> 30:14.105
lacrosse championship,
and a bulletproof
five-year plan.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.067
- You have a five-year plan?

30:17.609 --> 30:19.736
(scoffs)
- You don't?

30:20.195 --> 30:21.946
- I don't even have a plan
for tomorrow.

30:22.489 --> 30:25.075
- To each their own.
As for mine, I--

30:25.116 --> 30:27.118
- His uncle's gonna get him
a job at his law firm.

30:27.160 --> 30:29.746
- Wow, that's a good plan.

30:29.788 --> 30:32.207
- Well, on top of that,
I'm dating

30:32.248 --> 30:34.626
the hottest girl
in camp.

30:34.668 --> 30:36.586
- Brades, don't exaggerate.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.465
- You're so cute.

30:41.049 --> 30:43.176
(**)

30:46.888 --> 30:48.890
(thunder rumbling)
- Let's see here.

30:48.932 --> 30:51.267
Oh, yeah.
There's a contraction.

30:51.309 --> 30:52.686
(mooing)

30:52.727 --> 30:54.354
I'm gonna see...

30:54.396 --> 30:56.481
I'm gonna see where
she is on this.

30:57.399 --> 30:59.776
Come on. I'm too old for this.

31:00.276 --> 31:02.737
- Nice and easy, it's okay.
- Oh, God.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.322
- Good girl.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.449
(thunder rumbling)

31:06.991 --> 31:08.660
- Elliot?
- Uh-huh?

31:08.702 --> 31:11.079
- We've got a problem.
- What? What's wrong?

31:11.121 --> 31:12.706
- It's breach.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.125
Gotta do this fast.

31:18.670 --> 31:19.921
(indistinct chatter)

31:19.963 --> 31:22.132
(Kat): This is gonna be so fun.

31:22.173 --> 31:23.800
I'm kind of nervous.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.803
- Man, I'm so psyched
for this movie.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.930
(indistinct chatter)

31:28.972 --> 31:31.224
Hey. What's wrong?

31:31.266 --> 31:32.851
- What do you mean?

31:33.435 --> 31:36.604
- This Brady clown,
he's got you all rattled.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.482
- Uh, yeah, he is a clown,
isn't he?

31:40.316 --> 31:43.278
Sorry, I just can't picture Kat

31:43.319 --> 31:45.405
ending up with this guy.
(Kat laughs)

31:46.448 --> 31:47.866
- Who's to say that she will?

31:48.825 --> 31:50.201
Listen...

31:51.119 --> 31:53.747
If you want to bail,
I'll bail with you.

31:53.788 --> 31:55.540
Or you can bail alone,

31:55.582 --> 31:57.792
though it is more fun
ditching as a team.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.753
(chuckles)
- So,

31:59.794 --> 32:02.130
you two just gonna stand
out here looking all cute,

32:02.172 --> 32:03.757
or are you gonna come in
and watch a movie?

32:05.050 --> 32:07.010
- This should be fun.

32:07.052 --> 32:10.055
Uh, parents, Alice.
Alice, parents.

32:10.096 --> 32:11.973
- Joyce.
- Jude.

32:12.015 --> 32:14.684
- Nice to meet you.
I-I didn't know that you'd be
joining us.

32:15.185 --> 32:17.103
- Do you think we would let
our son,

32:17.145 --> 32:19.647
he of rampant hormones
and changing body,

32:19.689 --> 32:21.399
date without chaperones?

32:21.441 --> 32:22.984
- Inappropriate.
- Really?

32:23.026 --> 32:24.361
- Yes!
- They're kidding.

32:24.402 --> 32:26.321
They own the theater.

32:26.363 --> 32:29.991
I work here too, I just took
the night off,

32:30.033 --> 32:32.952
so I think
we're done here.

32:33.745 --> 32:34.996
- It was nice to meet you.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.124
- Nice to meet you.
- Enjoy the movie, it's good.

32:38.166 --> 32:40.168
And it's all totally real.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.795
- Come on. Can you just...?

32:41.836 --> 32:43.963
- Okay, but I like her.

32:44.005 --> 32:45.882
(indistinct chatter)

32:51.096 --> 32:52.430
- Yeah, warning,

32:52.472 --> 32:55.225
the whole film is handheld,

32:55.266 --> 32:57.560
so make sure after
you're done your popcorn,

32:57.602 --> 33:00.271
keep the bucket. Makes it easier
to mop afterwards.

33:00.313 --> 33:02.565
- Okay, whatever you want.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.694
- Hey! You remember Brady.
Right, Elliot?

33:06.152 --> 33:08.738
- Yeah. Same Brady from
a few hours ago.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.490
I remember.

33:10.532 --> 33:11.449
(chuckles)

33:11.491 --> 33:13.201
So, what can I get you guys.

33:13.243 --> 33:14.744
- Hmm? What'll it be?

33:14.786 --> 33:15.829
Anything you want.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.664
(Kat laughs)
- Okay.

33:17.706 --> 33:19.708
Two popcorns.

33:19.749 --> 33:22.168
And two drinks,
one for each of us.

33:22.210 --> 33:24.212
And the pink cotton candy.

33:24.254 --> 33:26.006
(Brady): Pink cotton candy,
please.

33:27.882 --> 33:30.385
Oh, no, no, no. I got it.

33:31.845 --> 33:33.513
- Wow, thanks.

33:34.222 --> 33:36.391
- Yeah, thanks.
- Thanks.

33:39.019 --> 33:41.396
- Oh. Um, sorry,

33:41.438 --> 33:44.232
I can't, uh,
run your mom's credit card

33:44.274 --> 33:46.735
if she's not here, so...
- Hey, man. It's my card.

33:46.776 --> 33:49.779
It's just--
- Elliot. Can't' you make
an exception?

33:53.408 --> 33:55.660
- My parents own the place.

33:55.702 --> 33:57.912
Why don't we just say
snacks on the house?

33:58.496 --> 34:01.666
- Really? Great. Thanks, Nick.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.668
- Thanks.

34:04.711 --> 34:06.421
- Thanks, Nick.

34:07.505 --> 34:09.299
Sweet outfit, Elliot.

34:09.841 --> 34:11.301
(laughing)

34:13.720 --> 34:14.929
Alright, let's go.

34:14.971 --> 34:16.181
- Hey.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.390
You okay?

34:17.432 --> 34:18.933
- Uh, yeah, I'm fine.

34:18.975 --> 34:21.811
(Nick): Don't worry, it's a
summer thing. They won't last.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.439
Thanks for covering my shift.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.441
I owe you one.

34:28.318 --> 34:30.320
(**)

34:33.073 --> 34:35.283
(grunts)
- God, the shoulder's stuck.

34:35.325 --> 34:37.369
I don't have the strength,
Elliot.

34:37.410 --> 34:40.789
You're gonna have to help me.
Please, help me, please!

34:40.830 --> 34:42.332
- What do I do?

34:43.166 --> 34:45.835
- Okay. This is what
I need you to do.

34:46.294 --> 34:48.254
Put this on.
- Alright.

34:48.296 --> 34:50.256
- There you go. And...

34:50.674 --> 34:53.134
...put this chain around
your hand. That's it.

34:53.176 --> 34:55.303
Now, you're gonna put your hand
in there,

34:55.345 --> 34:56.971
and you're gonna look
for a hoof.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.140
It's better if it's a front
hoof, but it doesn't matter.

34:59.182 --> 35:00.558
Get in there.

35:00.600 --> 35:02.560
Take your time.
- Okay.

35:02.602 --> 35:04.979
- It's okay, it's okay.

35:05.021 --> 35:07.524
(grunts)
Okay.

35:07.565 --> 35:08.942
- Okay?

35:08.983 --> 35:11.986
I don't feel anything.
- Don't give up. Come on.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.447
- I-I...
- Look for it!

35:14.489 --> 35:16.074
- I-I feel it. I got it.

35:16.116 --> 35:17.409
I got the hoof.

35:17.450 --> 35:19.077
- Okay, good. Put the chain over
the hoof.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.454
- Okay. Got it. I'm gonna pull.

35:21.496 --> 35:23.373
- Come on, Missy.
- Come on.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.751
- Just take it easy, Elliot.

35:28.128 --> 35:29.462
(grunts)

35:34.384 --> 35:36.386
(tense music)

35:38.972 --> 35:41.433
- I can't lose her, Elliot.

35:42.350 --> 35:43.852
- Yeah.

35:43.893 --> 35:45.895
- Help!

35:47.188 --> 35:48.732
Please, help us!

35:48.773 --> 35:50.025
(Kat laughs)

35:50.066 --> 35:51.943
Help us!

35:51.985 --> 35:53.903
(woman): This is not the way
to get out of here.

35:54.738 --> 35:56.656
(soft music)

35:58.366 --> 36:00.076
(screaming)

36:00.118 --> 36:01.494
(chuckling)

36:07.500 --> 36:08.793
- I've gotta go to the washroom.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.678
(woman crying)

36:21.389 --> 36:23.516
- Yep, absolutely. Absolutely.

36:24.267 --> 36:25.393
(sighs)

36:25.435 --> 36:26.811
- So, what do you think
of your dad?

36:26.853 --> 36:29.647
- I can't process it, Elliot.
He's...

36:29.689 --> 36:32.525
Is this what he's like?
He's a jerk!

36:32.567 --> 36:34.819
- Just think, you're not even
a twinkle in his eye yet.

36:34.861 --> 36:37.238
- No, he's nothing like this
in Minneapolis.

36:37.280 --> 36:39.240
In my time, he's generous,

36:39.282 --> 36:41.409
and he's like, a really
good cook,

36:41.451 --> 36:44.079
and he's funny,
and he's a decent person!

36:44.120 --> 36:47.290
- Minneapolis? I thought you
said you were from Port Haven?

36:47.749 --> 36:49.959
- No, my parents
are splitting up.

36:50.418 --> 36:52.962
My mom and I came here,
and my dad stayed.

36:55.215 --> 36:57.967
- Um... Sorry, I didn't know.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.847
Look...

37:04.099 --> 37:05.934
He's a good dad, right?

37:05.975 --> 37:08.603
And isn't that what matters,
right? And Kat...

37:10.063 --> 37:11.856
I'm sure Kat's a great mom.

37:13.358 --> 37:16.277
- Yeah. You're right.

37:16.736 --> 37:18.571
I should get back in there.

37:22.409 --> 37:24.160
- Come on, come on.

37:25.495 --> 37:27.163
(grunting)
Come on, girl.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.749
Come on.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.127
- Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

37:32.168 --> 37:34.004
(grunting)

37:34.045 --> 37:35.839
(thudding)
Oh! Oh!

37:36.548 --> 37:38.675
Oh!
(laughing)

37:40.885 --> 37:43.013
(**)

37:47.017 --> 37:49.436
(laughing)

37:49.477 --> 37:51.479
- You did it! Oh, you did it!

37:51.521 --> 37:53.523
You did it!

37:55.525 --> 37:57.027
Thank you!

37:57.068 --> 37:59.154
(sobbing)

37:59.195 --> 38:00.905
Oh my gosh.

38:08.413 --> 38:09.831
- Hey.

38:09.873 --> 38:11.124
- Hey.

38:11.166 --> 38:12.876
- I need to talk to you.

38:21.134 --> 38:22.677
She's my daughter.

38:22.719 --> 38:24.429
I mean, you seriously thought
that not telling me

38:24.471 --> 38:28.016
that she's been travelling
through time was a good idea?

38:28.058 --> 38:29.309
- Wait, wait.

38:30.101 --> 38:31.186
You know?

38:31.227 --> 38:32.687
- Yes, I know.

38:32.729 --> 38:35.648
I saw her, El, in the field!

38:35.690 --> 38:37.525
At dinner,
at the movies.

38:37.567 --> 38:39.444
- Okay, start over.

38:39.486 --> 38:42.364
You went through the pond? Now?

38:42.405 --> 38:44.616
As in, like, travelled back
to 1999?

38:44.657 --> 38:47.327
Because if that's true,
that means...

38:47.369 --> 38:49.371
Oh, God.
What does that mean?

38:49.412 --> 38:51.373
- I don't even care
what that means.

38:51.915 --> 38:54.250
You have been lying to me

38:54.292 --> 38:57.128
since we were 15 years old!

38:57.796 --> 38:59.214
- I was helping Alice.

38:59.255 --> 39:01.591
Trying to walk her through
all of this. She's--

39:01.633 --> 39:03.927
- She's... She's my kid.

39:03.968 --> 39:06.638
Okay? I can take care
of my own family.

39:10.266 --> 39:11.351
- Really?

39:12.352 --> 39:13.895
Then why don't you?

39:13.937 --> 39:15.772
Alice has been travelling
through time

39:15.814 --> 39:17.649
for how long
without you noticing?

39:17.691 --> 39:18.942
And what about Del?

39:18.983 --> 39:21.069
I have been here
all night with her

39:21.111 --> 39:23.113
while you were off
navel-gazing in the past.

39:23.154 --> 39:24.447
Look at the house.

39:24.489 --> 39:26.241
Take a look at the boat, Kat.

39:26.282 --> 39:30.120
This place is falling apart,
and she is all on her own.

39:30.161 --> 39:33.415
You should be helping Del,
not making her life harder.

39:37.502 --> 39:39.170
(Del): Elliot!

39:45.260 --> 39:47.095
- Oh my gosh!

39:47.137 --> 39:48.346
(chuckling)

39:50.265 --> 39:53.393
- Colton gave me Old Miss's mama
as a gift.

39:54.436 --> 39:55.770
(sighs)

39:55.812 --> 39:58.106
After he died, I sold the herd.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.817
It was just way too much work
for me to do by myself.

40:04.779 --> 40:08.116
So, he is the last descendant.

40:08.158 --> 40:11.786
The last trace of what Colton
and I did here.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.956
I couldn't...

40:15.457 --> 40:17.500
I couldn't lose Old Miss.

40:17.542 --> 40:19.377
I couldn't bear for...

40:21.838 --> 40:23.840
...one more thing
to change here.

40:24.549 --> 40:25.925
(soft music)

40:25.967 --> 40:27.594
I want to thank you, Elliot.

40:27.635 --> 40:29.679
- You already did, Del.
It's okay.

40:29.721 --> 40:32.974
- No. Not just for tonight.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.060
I want to thank you
for everything.

40:36.269 --> 40:39.481
- Yeah. Thank you, El.

40:41.399 --> 40:42.942
Thank you.

40:44.235 --> 40:45.945
(vehicle approaching)

40:50.033 --> 40:54.079
* I've been waiting on my own *

40:54.746 --> 40:56.498
* Too long *

40:58.583 --> 41:02.128
* This year's love
had better last *

41:02.962 --> 41:04.839
Brady?

41:04.881 --> 41:07.008
What... What are you
doing here?

41:08.176 --> 41:09.302
(sighs)

41:09.344 --> 41:12.222
- I missed Alice,
so I booked a flight.

41:14.641 --> 41:16.476
Happy to see me?

41:19.562 --> 41:23.316
* Whoa, yeah *

41:23.942 --> 41:29.364
* This year's love
had better last *

41:33.952 --> 41:38.123
* When you hold me like you do *

41:38.164 --> 41:42.293
* It feels so right, oh now *

41:42.836 --> 41:49.509
* I start to forget
how my heart gets torn *

41:49.551 --> 41:53.930
* When that hurt gets thrown *

41:53.972 --> 41:58.560
* Feeling like you
can't go on **
