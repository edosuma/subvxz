Hundred percent.

02:47.702 --> 02:49.469

02:49.504 --> 02:51.338
-Infinite.
-Hundred percent.

02:51.371 --> 02:53.808
How many "Y"s do I put in "Hey"
at this time of night?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.342
-Is it before 2:00 a.m.?
-Yeah.

02:55.375 --> 02:56.811
-Two "Y"s.
-Okay.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.913
-Three is thirsty.
-Thirsty.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.948
And one is curt.

03:00.982 --> 03:02.282
<i>You know what</i>
<i>I was thinking about?</i>

03:02.315 --> 03:03.818
Cookie dough became so popular.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.920
It's 'cause it's not finished.
It could still be anything.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.622
Hundred percent.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.423
Making cookies out of cookie
dough is just a suggestion.

03:09.456 --> 03:10.758
<i>-Hundred percent.</i>
<i>-That's what they say</i>

03:10.792 --> 03:12.359
-you could do with it.
-Right.

03:12.392 --> 03:13.695
And the same thing--
like dating someone

03:13.728 --> 03:14.962
for more than a month.

03:14.996 --> 03:16.564
It's just a serving suggestion.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.432
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

03:18.465 --> 03:19.901
"Kara question mark."
That means I don't remember

03:19.934 --> 03:21.502
-where I met her.
-Okay.

03:21.536 --> 03:22.904
But it's a question mark
with an exclamation point,

03:22.937 --> 03:24.672
which means I should
want to follow up.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.674
<i>-Let's see what the options</i>
<i>are first though. -Yes.</i>

03:26.708 --> 03:28.843
Exactly that. That's the world
that we're living in.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.445
You can just see what
the options are for anything.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.847
Like with travel.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.347
You're not gonna just pick
the first flight you see.

03:34.381 --> 03:35.449
You want to see all the flights.

03:35.482 --> 03:36.751
-That's a good thing.
-Yeah.

03:36.784 --> 03:38.385
You get the best flight
that way.

03:38.418 --> 03:39.754
Why wouldn't you get
the best person

03:39.787 --> 03:41.689
by looking at all
the potential people?

03:41.723 --> 03:43.256
<i>And how could you even</i>
<i>expect to find one person</i>

03:43.290 --> 03:44.759
who could fulfill
all of your needs?

03:44.792 --> 03:47.929
It's easier just to find the
most supportive person here.

03:47.962 --> 03:49.797
-The funniest person here.
-Right.

03:49.831 --> 03:51.032
-The best sex here.
-Right.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.332
The best advice here.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.935
The second-best sex here.

03:53.968 --> 03:55.402
Hundred percent.

03:55.435 --> 03:56.771
<i>I don't ever want to go past</i>

03:56.804 --> 03:58.539
<i>knowing what someone's parents</i>
<i>do for a living.</i>

03:58.573 --> 04:00.007
If I know what someone's
parents do for a living...

04:00.041 --> 04:01.809
-Right. Right.
-I've hung too long.

04:01.843 --> 04:03.745
<i>Or, like, siblings. Like,</i>
<i>why does anyone want to know</i>

04:03.778 --> 04:05.580
about your siblings?
Especially so early.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.481
-Yeah. -"How many siblings
do you have?"

04:07.515 --> 04:09.050
Has that ever changed whether
you want to date somebody?

04:09.083 --> 04:10.752
It's like, "I have two sisters
and a brother."

04:10.785 --> 04:12.419
-Whoa. Hold on.
-Well, I'm out of here.

04:12.452 --> 04:13.755
-I'm out of here.
-You know what I just say?

04:13.788 --> 04:15.489
I only date only children
or the oldest of three.

04:15.523 --> 04:16.624
<i>They say,</i>
<i>"Exercise your options."</i>

04:16.656 --> 04:17.692
It's like a muscle.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.627
-Options are like a muscle.
-Yeah.

04:19.660 --> 04:21.796
Some people are weak
and atrophied,

04:21.829 --> 04:23.064
and they don't understand

04:23.097 --> 04:24.766
-how to exercise their options.
-Yeah.

04:24.799 --> 04:28.335
My options are burly
and strong and turgid.

04:28.368 --> 04:29.937
<i>Hundred percent.</i>

04:29.971 --> 04:32.339
<i>People say guys like us</i>
<i>are afraid of commitment.</i>

04:32.372 --> 04:33.908
No. We're afraid of commitment

04:33.941 --> 04:35.442
to something
we can't get out of.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.044
There's no such thing
as fear of commitment.

04:37.078 --> 04:39.479
Fear of commitment
is fear of regret.

04:39.514 --> 04:41.448
<i>Hundred percent.</i>
<i>Or fear of intimacy.</i>

04:41.481 --> 04:43.383
<i>Please, I'm intimate</i>
<i>with everybody.</i>

04:43.416 --> 04:45.485
<i>Do you ever wonder,</i>

04:45.520 --> 04:48.556
if you did find something
deeper with somebody,

04:48.589 --> 04:50.925
if that would somehow
be more meaningful?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.927
I do sometimes.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.361
Like right now,
I'm casually dating,

04:54.394 --> 04:55.797
like, six or seven
different women.

04:55.830 --> 04:57.965
But I do wonder, deep down,
what it would be like

04:57.999 --> 05:00.668
to seriously date two or three.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.770
Even when
I don't understand you,

05:02.804 --> 05:04.939
I understand you better
than I understand anybody.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.108
<i>-Hundred percent.</i>
<i>-I love when we hang out.</i>

05:07.141 --> 05:09.409
This is like,
if someone were recording this,

05:09.442 --> 05:10.878
that's what my podcast
should be.

05:10.912 --> 05:13.014
There should be, like,
the sound of a stand-up bass

05:13.047 --> 05:14.682
playing under me right now.

05:16.416 --> 05:17.450
<i>Okay, I got one.</i>

05:17.484 --> 05:19.620
"Brunette Random House Party."

05:19.654 --> 05:21.122
"Random House," the publisher?

05:21.155 --> 05:24.424
Or "random house,"
like a random house party?

05:25.560 --> 05:26.894
Oh, "Emily Vogue."

05:26.928 --> 05:28.930
<i>Uh, I'm gonna go</i>
<i>with "Kara question mark"</i>

05:28.963 --> 05:30.865
<i>'cause I feel like letting the</i>
<i>universe surprise me tonight.</i>

05:30.898 --> 05:32.700
<i>-What a time to be alive.</i>
<i>-Hundred percent.</i>

05:32.733 --> 05:33.901
-Hundred percent.
-Hundred percent.

05:33.935 --> 05:35.036
Hundred percent.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.369
-Hundred percent.
-Hundred percent.

05:37.972 --> 05:39.106
<i>I figured it out.</i>

05:39.140 --> 05:40.541
<i>Figured what out?</i>

05:40.575 --> 05:42.510
America.

05:42.543 --> 05:43.578
Okay.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.846
I know you're laughing,

05:44.879 --> 05:46.047
but I have a pitch
you're really gonna like.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.582
America is divided,

05:47.615 --> 05:49.817
but it's not for the reason
that we think.

05:49.851 --> 05:52.520
We think that America's
divided by geography:

05:52.553 --> 05:55.723
red state, blue state,
city, country.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.092
We're missing something
far more profound.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.994
America isn't divided by space.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.863
America is divided by time.

06:01.896 --> 06:03.764
-We don't live
in the moment anymore. -Mm.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.867
And why would we, when we can
live in any moment

06:05.900 --> 06:07.400
that's ever been recorded?

06:07.434 --> 06:09.537
And when we experience
something we really love,

06:09.570 --> 06:10.738
our overwhelming instinct

06:10.771 --> 06:12.139
is to somehow file it away
for later.

06:12.173 --> 06:13.608
That's interesting.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.543
We don't watch movies
in the theater.

06:15.576 --> 06:16.911
We don't watch TV when it airs.

06:16.944 --> 06:20.748
We don't even have
conversations at the same time

06:20.781 --> 06:21.549
because we text.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.751
And when you text,
I can say, "Hi,"

06:23.784 --> 06:25.620
and you could say "Hi" back
in a second,

06:25.653 --> 06:27.822
-or a minute.
-Or never.

06:27.855 --> 06:30.024
Or never 'cause it's you

06:30.057 --> 06:32.159
and you're too busy producing
the biggest podcast in America,

06:32.193 --> 06:34.128
which is kind of my point
because we're all living

06:34.161 --> 06:36.564
in our own individualized times.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.634
That's why we're living
in divided times.

06:39.667 --> 06:40.668
That's... I like that. Ooh.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.503
-You like that?
-Yeah.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.538
So, what do you think?
Do you think that's a story?

06:45.907 --> 06:47.508
It's a theory.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.043
-A theory is a story.
-No, a theory is not a story.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.177
Yes, it is
when it's about an idea.

06:50.211 --> 06:51.946
And America is an idea.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.581
That's what makes it so great.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.750
-So, if you're...
-No, America is its people.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.552
That's what makes it
so fucked up.

06:58.586 --> 07:01.522
Hey. Not every white guy
in New York

07:01.555 --> 07:02.957
needs to have a podcast.

07:02.990 --> 07:04.558
You have
the verified check mark.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.227
You got the <i>New Yorker</i> position.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.561
I want something more.

07:07.595 --> 07:09.530
I don't just want
to be a writer.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.666
I... I want to be a voice.

07:11.699 --> 07:14.702
As dorky as it sounds,
I care about America.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.671
And not in that faded
Lana Del Rey way.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.939
And now I see it falling apart,

07:17.972 --> 07:19.607
and we're just standing
in the corner,

07:19.640 --> 07:21.809
like, making fun of it,
you know?

07:21.842 --> 07:25.947
I'd like to try to tell
some story that... connects.

07:25.980 --> 07:29.216
Okay, okay. Well, then...
let me help you connect.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.218
With all your ideas
about America--

07:31.252 --> 07:33.054
even if they're good, right?--

07:33.087 --> 07:34.555
you gotta put 'em in a story

07:34.588 --> 07:37.058
'cause Americans
listen to stories.

07:37.091 --> 07:38.491
'Cause Americans are people.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.494
They're not... ideas.

07:41.529 --> 07:43.864
-You're-you're here.
-Yeah.

07:43.898 --> 07:45.700
You need to be here.

07:45.733 --> 07:48.069
Does that make sense?

07:48.102 --> 07:50.004
Hundred percent.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.507
I'm Robin Dillon,

07:53.541 --> 07:54.976
and this is <i>American Moment.</i>

07:55.009 --> 07:58.512
To the organizers of the
Western Montana fly-fishing...

08:19.133 --> 08:20.234
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:20.267 --> 08:21.602
You changed your hair.

08:21.635 --> 08:23.137
-Yeah, you noticed.
-Of course.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.739
How's the book world?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.007
The what?

08:26.040 --> 08:27.975
Uh, nothing.
Uh, can I get you a drink?

08:28.009 --> 08:29.110
-Yes.
-Great.

08:29.143 --> 08:30.745
Um, what can I make you?

08:30.778 --> 08:33.014
Um, can you do, like,
a white wine?

08:33.047 --> 08:34.248
Um, sure.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.683
I have to open a bottle
for that.

08:35.716 --> 08:37.018
Oh, that's okay. Open it.

08:37.051 --> 08:39.285
I only want, like, one glass.

09:03.077 --> 09:05.646
-Hello?
-Ben?

09:07.081 --> 09:09.283
Yeah. Hello?

09:09.316 --> 09:10.918
This is the worst phone call

09:10.951 --> 09:13.621
you're ever gonna get
in your life.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.023
Oh, my God.

09:17.191 --> 09:19.760
Your girlfriend's dead.

09:19.794 --> 09:23.164
I'm sorry.
Wh... What did you say?

09:23.197 --> 09:24.665
She's dead.

09:24.698 --> 09:26.300
No, no, the first part.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.935
Your girlfriend.

09:27.968 --> 09:28.803
Yeah, I'm sorry.

09:28.836 --> 09:31.072
Hey, I don't...
I don't understand.

09:31.105 --> 09:32.740
I know. I know, I know.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.842
We can't make no sense
of it either.

09:34.875 --> 09:37.378
Who is this?

09:37.411 --> 09:39.080
This is Ty Shaw.

09:39.113 --> 09:40.681
Abby's brother.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.818
Um, hey, I don't... I don't
really know what to say.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.320
Oh, I know, I know this must
be so hard to process.

09:46.353 --> 09:48.122
I'm so sorry.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.890
Abby told us so much about you.

09:49.924 --> 09:51.759
Abby.

09:52.393 --> 09:55.663
Oh, my God.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.098
Abby.

09:57.131 --> 09:59.200
Who's Abby?

09:59.233 --> 10:00.367
Uh, some girl. Um...

10:00.401 --> 10:03.204
-Who's that?
-Uh, some...

10:04.038 --> 10:06.140
We definitely hung out
a few times.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.109
I-I wouldn't have...

10:08.142 --> 10:09.343
Funeral's Sunday.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.045
Oh, my God. I'm, uh...

10:11.078 --> 10:12.913
Can you tell me
where I can send flowers?

10:12.947 --> 10:15.416
Oh, there's no need
to send flowers, Ben.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.851
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:16.884 --> 10:18.285
I'm absolutely
gonna send flowers.

10:18.319 --> 10:19.720
Just, uh, you tell me
the address.

10:19.753 --> 10:21.255
See if you can text it to me.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.190
If you really want, there's
a flower shop by the airport.

10:23.224 --> 10:26.127
We'll just swing by there
when I pick you up.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.062
When you pick me up?

10:29.196 --> 10:31.198
Uh, hey.

10:31.232 --> 10:32.867
I will be there in spirit.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.668
Spirit Airlines. Right, man.

10:34.702 --> 10:35.870
That's a great choice.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.404
You just let me know
what flight.

10:37.438 --> 10:40.774
Uh, hey, uh, I...

10:40.808 --> 10:42.309
This is just...

10:42.343 --> 10:43.444
I can't do this.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.212
None of us can do this.

10:45.246 --> 10:46.680
Not alone.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.718
Y'all had your whole future
ahead of you.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.119
Okay.

10:52.153 --> 10:53.354
Okay, don't cry.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.891
I mean, no, cry. Cry.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.459
-Um, of course.
-Oh, God.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.127
Be in touch
with your emotions. Um...

11:00.161 --> 11:02.863
I can't believe
we have to go through this.

11:02.897 --> 11:05.299
Okay. All right. Um, hey.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.301
Remind me where you guys
are exactly.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.138
Well,
you've been to Texas before?

11:14.041 --> 11:16.477
Texas.

11:16.511 --> 11:18.179
Okay, are you near Austin?

11:19.480 --> 11:22.449
No, we're not near Austin.

11:22.483 --> 11:25.219
-Dallas?
-Dallas ain't Texas.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.956
-Houston?
-Houston's another country.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.925
Why don't you just
tell me where...

11:30.958 --> 11:33.494
Have you heard of Abilene?
The city.

11:33.528 --> 11:35.930
Never heard of Abilene, no.

11:35.963 --> 11:38.933
Well, Abilene is about
three hours from Dallas.

11:38.966 --> 11:39.767
Okay.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.236
And we're five hours
from Abilene.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.880
Ladies and gentlemen...

11:55.983 --> 11:57.818
Hey. Hi.

12:15.069 --> 12:16.870
And while she could be
quite a handful

12:16.904 --> 12:18.906
when she was a girl...

12:22.276 --> 12:24.245
I can't believe I'm talking
about my daughter

12:24.278 --> 12:26.313
in the past tense.

12:32.052 --> 12:34.488
She was living in New York.

12:34.522 --> 12:37.391
She was finding her voice
in music.

12:37.424 --> 12:41.529
And she finally found love.

12:41.563 --> 12:43.565
Ben Manalowitz.

12:43.598 --> 12:45.165
A successful writer

12:45.199 --> 12:47.001
and a regular contributor
to <i>New York Magazine.</i>

12:47.034 --> 12:49.003
<i>The New Yorker.</i>

12:49.036 --> 12:50.938
But even with all his success,

12:50.971 --> 12:54.041
he always respected our girl
for who she was.

12:54.908 --> 12:56.176
"Mama," she said,

12:56.210 --> 12:59.113
"you know how he has me saved
in his phone?

12:59.146 --> 13:00.247
Texas."

13:01.081 --> 13:03.884
Well, as short as her life was,

13:03.917 --> 13:05.486
she found her voice,

13:05.520 --> 13:08.322
and she found love.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.525
And that's all there is, right?

13:10.558 --> 13:13.794
That's right.

13:26.641 --> 13:28.208
Let's hear from Ben.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.577
-Go ahead.
-Go on, Ben.

13:29.611 --> 13:31.045
No, I couldn't.

13:31.078 --> 13:32.580
-Thank you.
-You got it.

13:32.614 --> 13:34.315
-Brother, come up.
-Please say something.

13:34.348 --> 13:36.950
Get up there.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.824
Father. Sir.

13:50.632 --> 13:55.235
I never expected to be
in a situation like this.

13:56.671 --> 13:58.238
I'm sure none of us did.

14:00.374 --> 14:03.344
I wish I had known her better.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.081
I wish I had spent more time
with her.

14:07.948 --> 14:11.251
I'm sure all of us feel that...

14:11.285 --> 14:13.020
right now.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.288
Yes.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.060
She loved music.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.231
I know that. I know that.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.999
She loved music.

14:26.033 --> 14:28.202
Yeah.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.941
And...

14:35.677 --> 14:38.613
...she will always be a song
in our hearts.

14:52.560 --> 14:53.994
"Song in our hearts."

14:54.027 --> 14:56.598
Phew. You damn near broke me
with that one.

14:56.631 --> 14:58.432
♪ It's those
eight-second chances ♪

14:58.465 --> 15:00.267
♪ And cowgirl glances ♪

15:00.300 --> 15:04.672
♪ It's the blood and the glory,
baby, that's why we ride... ♪

15:07.307 --> 15:09.143
Now, I don't know about you,
but...

15:09.176 --> 15:11.078
I know it hasn't been long,
but I feel like me and you,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.280
we got a real bond.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.549
Kind of like family.

15:14.582 --> 15:16.417
Hundred percent.

15:18.218 --> 15:19.486
Wow.

15:19.521 --> 15:21.288
A hundred percent?

15:22.289 --> 15:23.223
Yeah.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.560
Yeah. I felt really close
to you guys today.

15:25.593 --> 15:28.128
Don't just say that to say it.

15:28.763 --> 15:31.198
-Yeah.
-I knew it.

15:39.473 --> 15:41.308
Abilene just didn't die.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.143
She was murdered.

15:43.177 --> 15:46.079
And the two of us
are gonna avenge her death.

15:47.414 --> 15:48.750
What?

15:48.783 --> 15:51.586
You and me, we're gonna
track her killer down

15:51.619 --> 15:53.454
and deliver vengeance.

15:55.255 --> 15:58.025
Okay, nobody said anything
about a killer.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.528
An overdose?

16:00.562 --> 16:02.229
At a party in an oil field?

16:02.262 --> 16:05.065
Yeah. The girl never took so
much as an Advil in her life.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.502
You know that. You know her
better than anybody.

16:09.203 --> 16:10.705
Did you call the police
about this?

16:10.738 --> 16:14.107
In Texas, we don't dial 911.

16:14.776 --> 16:16.109
Not even for, like, a fire?

16:16.143 --> 16:17.712
Fire or ambulance, fine.

16:17.745 --> 16:19.681
Who do you think did it?

16:19.714 --> 16:21.181
I got a couple theories.

16:21.215 --> 16:24.218
Cartels. Mexican gangbanger
I got my eyes on.

16:24.251 --> 16:25.787
I mean,
this is just the beginning.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.154
It goes deep.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.524
And what's this based on?

16:29.557 --> 16:30.692
Gut.

16:30.725 --> 16:33.360
Right.
What's behind that though?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.630
Ain't nothing behind gut.

16:35.663 --> 16:38.232
Gut's behind everything else.
Otherwise, who are you?

16:38.265 --> 16:40.200
I really think this is
something for the police.

16:40.234 --> 16:42.269
Yeah. You talk about the police

16:42.302 --> 16:44.171
like it's just the same
everywhere.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.107
Like the police is, um,
McDonald's

16:47.140 --> 16:48.810
and justice is an Egg McMuffin.

16:48.843 --> 16:50.612
We don't have the police.

16:50.645 --> 16:52.379
We got Mike and Dan.

16:53.480 --> 16:58.085
You and me,
we were the men in her life.

16:58.786 --> 17:01.255
And they fucked
with the wrong two guys.

17:02.155 --> 17:04.458
Okay. Um...

17:04.491 --> 17:08.530
So, as, like,
a personal boundary,

17:08.563 --> 17:10.130
like, everybody's different.

17:10.163 --> 17:11.665
Some people don't eat
certain foods.

17:11.699 --> 17:14.233
You know, everybody...

17:14.268 --> 17:17.436
-I don't avenge deaths.
-Mm-hmm.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.406
It's just who I am.

17:19.439 --> 17:22.644
I... You know, I don't live
in a Liam Neeson movie.

17:23.645 --> 17:26.280
But you kind of look like a guy
from a Liam Neeson movie though.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.549
Okay.

17:27.582 --> 17:29.216
Which one am I thinking about?

17:29.249 --> 17:30.718
It-it was a train.
No, i-it was...

17:30.752 --> 17:32.152
-It was just on TV.
-I don't know.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.187
<i>Schindler's List.</i>
Oh, my God.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.291
You look like a lot
of those guys in that movie.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.527
Yeah. Thanks.

17:39.561 --> 17:42.095
You know, that was my least
favorite Liam Neeson movie.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.665
Huge downer.

17:43.698 --> 17:45.465
It was a really sad movie.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.669
Ty, I know that
you're in a lot of pain.

17:47.702 --> 17:49.169
Oh, yes, sir. We both are.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.572
And you have a lot of anger.

17:50.605 --> 17:53.541
Goddamn it,
I'm asking you for your help.

17:53.575 --> 17:56.443
If we don't do this,
it's like leaving her body

17:56.476 --> 18:00.080
out in the middle of that desert
for the rest of our lives.

18:01.281 --> 18:04.184
I know it the minute I saw you.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.254
'Cause heart sees heart.

18:08.221 --> 18:11.224
Stay down here and avenge
Abby's death with me.

18:12.760 --> 18:15.630
Oh, what a story that would be.

18:24.672 --> 18:26.239
Is this a pocket dial?

18:26.273 --> 18:27.341
I have a story.

18:27.374 --> 18:28.743
-Can it wait?
-No.

18:28.776 --> 18:30.645
I'm in Texas. I'm on my way
back from a funeral.

18:30.678 --> 18:32.312
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

18:32.346 --> 18:35.115
It's okay. It's not someone
I was close to.

18:35.717 --> 18:37.719
But you flew to Texas for it?

18:37.752 --> 18:39.353
Uh, yes.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.689
Uh, it was a girl
I hooked up with a few times.

18:41.723 --> 18:43.390
You flew to Texas

18:43.423 --> 18:45.727
to attend the funeral
of a random hookup?

18:45.760 --> 18:48.630
Her family thought that we
were more serious than I did.

18:48.663 --> 18:49.797
Do you know what?

18:49.831 --> 18:51.498
This is a story.

18:51.532 --> 18:53.467
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

18:53.501 --> 18:54.301
It's you.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.336
The-the...
Your whole way of life.

18:56.370 --> 18:58.372
It's dating,
it's hookup culture.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.742
How it enables disconnectedness.

19:00.775 --> 19:02.644
-The selfishness.
-No.

19:02.677 --> 19:03.911
-The emptiness.
-No.

19:03.945 --> 19:04.912
-The hollowness.
-That's not what I meant.

19:04.946 --> 19:06.279
The lack of self-awareness.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.481
Okay, that's not
what I'm pitching.

19:07.515 --> 19:08.716
It's really how sad
your life is.

19:08.750 --> 19:09.951
Okay, now you're fucking
with me.

19:09.984 --> 19:12.920
Listen, I'm in West Texas

19:12.954 --> 19:14.555
where this family
just lost their daughter

19:14.589 --> 19:15.690
to an opioid overdose.

19:15.723 --> 19:17.525
That is sad but common.

19:17.558 --> 19:21.261
Except, her brother
won't accept it's an overdose.

19:21.294 --> 19:22.530
He says it was a murder.

19:22.563 --> 19:23.865
Based on what?

19:23.898 --> 19:25.566
Nothing.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.934
And that's the story.

19:26.968 --> 19:29.302
This is an existential
crime story.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.339
This is <i>In Cold Blood,</i>
but there are no killers.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.341
This is about
a new American reality

19:34.374 --> 19:35.810
that people can't accept.

19:35.843 --> 19:38.680
So instead, they invent
these myths and conspiracies

19:38.713 --> 19:42.684
so they can cast themselves
as heroes because...

19:42.717 --> 19:44.952
the truth is too hard to accept.

19:44.986 --> 19:48.956
The death of Abilene is about
the death of American identity

19:48.990 --> 19:50.525
and the need to find someone
to blame for it.

19:50.558 --> 19:54.461
This isn't just a story
about vengeance.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.330
It's a story about
the need for vengeance.

19:57.364 --> 20:01.602
The meaning of vengeance.

20:05.272 --> 20:06.808
Dead white girl?

20:06.841 --> 20:08.710
Holy grail of podcasts.

20:08.743 --> 20:12.479
Eloise, I wish my recorder
were already on.

20:12.513 --> 20:13.948
He's saying such
crazy things already.

20:13.981 --> 20:16.249
Her brother?

20:17.417 --> 20:19.486
He is such a character.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.421
And you can get close
to the family?

20:21.455 --> 20:23.490
Can I get close to the family?

20:23.524 --> 20:25.727
They think I was her boyfriend.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.428
I mean...

20:29.429 --> 20:31.666
...I went to her funeral,
for God's sake.

20:31.699 --> 20:32.900
That's good.

20:32.934 --> 20:34.836
I mean, it's fucked up, but...

20:34.869 --> 20:36.571
but it's good for this.

20:36.604 --> 20:38.506
So?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.709
Okay, let's give it a shot.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.645
Oh!

20:44.679 --> 20:45.980
Okay, talk to me.
Give me everything.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.447
Stay with the family,

20:47.481 --> 20:49.550
get as close as possible,
record everything.

20:49.584 --> 20:51.318
'Cause you never know
what will be important.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.487
I'll be your editor,
so I'll pull selects

20:53.521 --> 20:54.822
-and see what's there.
-Okay.

20:54.856 --> 20:56.691
I'll have Tracy overnight you
the equipment,

20:56.724 --> 20:58.893
but just use your phone
in the meantime

20:58.926 --> 21:00.995
and get the story, stay safe.

21:01.028 --> 21:02.429
You got it.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.297
-Not in that order.
-In that order.

21:13.508 --> 21:18.378
The dust in West Texas
settles like rain on a lake.

21:18.411 --> 21:21.716
I'm under a West Texas sky,
bright blue Texan sky,

21:21.749 --> 21:26.053
where I've just learned about
the death of Abilene Shaw.

21:26.087 --> 21:28.689
My...

21:28.723 --> 21:30.758
A person...

21:31.893 --> 21:33.861
...who lived here.

21:42.103 --> 21:44.605
Hell yeah, brother.

21:44.639 --> 21:46.941
All right.

21:46.974 --> 21:49.409
I'm gonna stay with you guys
for a couple of weeks.

21:49.442 --> 21:50.978
I'm gonna record everything

21:51.012 --> 21:52.547
that you think happened
to Abilene.

21:52.580 --> 21:54.582
-Okay?
-Hell yes. Then we kill him.

21:54.615 --> 21:55.550
No.

21:55.583 --> 21:58.451
I'm gonna put it on a podcast...

21:59.386 --> 22:04.959
...and it will be on
podcast platforms.

22:04.992 --> 22:06.894
That's fucking brilliant.

22:06.928 --> 22:08.996
-Yeah.
-You're fucking smart.

22:09.030 --> 22:10.463
All right.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.899
Once people on Reddit
find out...

22:13.400 --> 22:14.802
...they'll kill him for us.

22:23.878 --> 22:26.346
<i>All right.</i>

22:38.458 --> 22:39.594
<i>Hey, Mama.</i>

22:39.627 --> 22:41.494
<i>Guess who came back after all.</i>

22:42.163 --> 22:43.531
Ben.

22:43.564 --> 22:45.099
-Hi.
-Oh, my God. You came back.

22:45.132 --> 22:46.934
Ah... Oh. Thank you.

22:46.968 --> 22:49.937
Um, I hope I'm not imposing.

22:49.971 --> 22:51.438
Please.

22:51.471 --> 22:52.840
We have this empty seat
at the table.

22:52.874 --> 22:55.676
We can use all the distraction
we can get.

22:56.510 --> 22:58.145
Can I get you anything?

22:58.179 --> 22:59.647
Um...

22:59.680 --> 23:02.415
Uh, just, uh,
what's the Wi-Fi situation?

23:02.449 --> 23:03.885
Oh, it's a little
temperamental-- it'll kick in.

23:03.918 --> 23:06.120
Did you have a chance
to meet everybody before?

23:06.153 --> 23:07.487
Uh, no.

23:07.521 --> 23:08.789
I would love to.

23:08.823 --> 23:10.591
-Uh, this is Abilene's
sister, Paris. -Hi.

23:10.625 --> 23:12.760
-She's 24, fixin' to be 25.
-Yep.

23:12.793 --> 23:14.494
She's gonna be
a famous filmmaker.

23:14.528 --> 23:16.831
It is a pleasure
to meet you, Paris.

23:16.864 --> 23:18.799
Pleasure.
I've heard so much about you.

23:18.833 --> 23:21.434
I've-I've heard... Yeah.

23:21.468 --> 23:22.637
And this is Kansas City.

23:22.670 --> 23:24.572
She's 17, fixin' to be 18.

23:24.605 --> 23:26.774
And she's gonna be a famous...

23:26.807 --> 23:27.975
Just famous.

23:28.009 --> 23:29.476
KC, I told you.

23:29.510 --> 23:31.478
Those are not our values.

23:31.512 --> 23:34.115
You have to be
a famous something.

23:34.148 --> 23:36.984
A famous...

23:37.018 --> 23:38.619
celebrity.

23:39.954 --> 23:41.155
These are really your daughters?

23:41.188 --> 23:43.190
I mean,
you all could be sisters.

23:43.224 --> 23:44.659
Oh. You are so sweet.

23:44.692 --> 23:46.027
You think that I look
this fucking old?

23:47.228 --> 23:49.462
And this is El Stupido.

23:49.496 --> 23:51.599
-Sorry?
-This is El Stupido.

23:52.233 --> 23:54.068
That's what you call him?

23:54.101 --> 23:55.236
Oh. It's okay, Ben.

23:55.269 --> 23:57.004
He don't speak Spanish.

23:59.607 --> 24:02.810
And, uh, and how old are you?

24:02.843 --> 24:04.779
Nine.

24:04.812 --> 24:06.847
Fixin' to be ten?

24:11.085 --> 24:12.485
Yes, sir.

24:12.520 --> 24:13.788
Boys, come on.

24:13.821 --> 24:15.222
-Ben, come take a seat.
-Thank you.

24:15.256 --> 24:16.691
You have a lovely home,
by the way.

24:16.724 --> 24:18.259
-Thank you.
-It's really nice.

24:18.292 --> 24:19.560
-This is Granny Carole.
-Yeah.

24:19.593 --> 24:20.761
Granny for short.

24:20.795 --> 24:23.164
-Um, nice to meet you, Granny.
-Yeah.

24:23.197 --> 24:25.700
Thank you. Um...

24:25.733 --> 24:28.202
So, Ben, tell us about yourself.

24:28.235 --> 24:30.071
Do you come from a close family?

24:30.104 --> 24:31.973
Yes. Um, we're very close.

24:32.006 --> 24:35.475
We don't see each other much,
but we're very close.

24:36.177 --> 24:38.179
You from Texas?

24:38.212 --> 24:40.147
Oh. No, I'm not.

24:40.181 --> 24:41.248
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:41.282 --> 24:42.950
That you're not from Texas.

24:44.685 --> 24:46.654
-Have you been to Texas
before, Ben? -Yes, actually.

24:46.687 --> 24:48.189
I've been to Austin,
uh, for South By.

24:48.222 --> 24:49.790
For what?

24:49.824 --> 24:51.859
Uh, oh, South by Southwest
is an annual festiv...

24:51.892 --> 24:53.227
No, for what band?

24:53.260 --> 24:55.062
You don't just go to South By.

24:55.096 --> 24:57.031
You go see a band, don't you?

24:58.032 --> 24:59.233
Uh, well, true.

24:59.266 --> 25:01.135
I was part of a journalism panel

25:01.168 --> 25:02.703
about the future of new media.

25:02.737 --> 25:04.271
-Amazing.
-That's so cool.

25:04.305 --> 25:05.906
-Mm. -Thank you.
-You're welcome.

25:05.940 --> 25:07.875
Um, speaking of.

25:07.908 --> 25:10.277
Would you mind if I recorded
this dinner?

25:10.311 --> 25:11.645
-Oh.
-Record us now?

25:11.679 --> 25:12.279
-Yeah.
-Hell yeah.

25:12.313 --> 25:13.881
Would we mind?

25:13.914 --> 25:15.182
-I love being recorded.
-Great. Fantastic.

25:15.216 --> 25:16.283
Oh, my God.

25:16.317 --> 25:17.785
-Hey, smile. Okay?
-Great.

25:17.818 --> 25:19.120
Well, would you want to hear

25:19.153 --> 25:21.155
the story of Texas?

25:21.188 --> 25:23.157
-Absolutely. -Huh?
-Go, Granny.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.859
All right. Right here.

25:24.892 --> 25:26.660
-My goodness.
-Mm. Okay.

25:27.328 --> 25:28.662
1836.

25:28.696 --> 25:30.097
Texas is part of Mexico,

25:30.131 --> 25:33.300
made up of settlers and
English-speaking white folk.

25:33.334 --> 25:35.169
And, uh, they didn't
like the government.

25:35.202 --> 25:36.737
What else is new?

25:36.771 --> 25:38.305
Them Texans wanted to do things
their own way.

25:38.339 --> 25:39.807
What else is new?

25:39.840 --> 25:43.177
So, you take everybody's
two favorite things,

25:43.210 --> 25:46.147
government and Mexicans.

25:46.180 --> 25:48.049
And guess what happens.

25:48.082 --> 25:49.316
-Huh?
-Go on.

25:49.350 --> 25:50.618
-Guess.
-You should... In your words.

25:50.651 --> 25:51.786
All right. All right.

25:51.819 --> 25:54.188
Well, Generalissimo Santa Anna

25:54.221 --> 25:57.291
brung up 7,000 Mexican soldiers

25:57.324 --> 26:00.361
to fight against
186 Texan rebels

26:00.394 --> 26:02.930
at a place called the Alamo.

26:02.963 --> 26:04.765
And the Texans won.

26:04.799 --> 26:06.667
That's very inspiring.

26:06.700 --> 26:08.135
Say what?

26:09.837 --> 26:11.972
The Texans didn't win, Ben.

26:12.006 --> 26:13.641
Mm.

26:13.674 --> 26:16.177
They teach math where you from?

26:16.210 --> 26:19.346
186. 7,000.

26:19.380 --> 26:21.215
Um...

26:21.248 --> 26:23.684
7,000 is more, Ben.

26:23.717 --> 26:26.555
It was a massacre.

26:27.221 --> 26:29.623
It was unspeakable cruelty.

26:29.657 --> 26:31.125
Unspeakable cruelty.

26:31.158 --> 26:34.295
I'm sorry. I had no idea
you didn't win the Alamo.

26:34.328 --> 26:36.697
Um...

26:36.730 --> 26:38.833
I feel like you guys
talk about it a lot.

26:38.866 --> 26:41.268
Who's "Equinox Girl Cute"?

26:41.302 --> 26:42.970
Um, a friend.

26:43.003 --> 26:45.106
Who's "Paris Review Party
Asian"?

26:45.139 --> 26:46.941
-Excuse me. Um...
-Very good reading.

26:46.974 --> 26:49.376
Let me, uh... The Wi-Fi
must have just kicked on.

26:49.410 --> 26:51.011
Who's "Natalie Bumble"?

26:51.045 --> 26:53.380
-Um, let-let me just...
-Who's "Katie Raya"?

26:53.414 --> 26:54.748
-Let me put that on...
-Raya?

26:54.782 --> 26:56.217
Let me put that on
airplane mode.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.985
I thought Raya
was supposed to be exclusive.

26:58.018 --> 26:59.920
So what do you think
of this place, Ben?

26:59.954 --> 27:01.922
I love it.

27:01.956 --> 27:03.891
-Are you joking?
-Are you serious? You love it?

27:03.924 --> 27:05.259
You're from New York City.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.827
-Literally nothing
happens here. -Yeah.

27:06.861 --> 27:11.132
Well, um...
I mean, it is a little...

27:11.165 --> 27:13.400
-Hmm?
-You know.

27:13.434 --> 27:14.969
-Bleak. -Come on,
that's not fair.

27:15.002 --> 27:16.737
-We just got a Target.
-Excuse me? How dare you?

27:16.770 --> 27:18.772
Do you know how fucking good
our football team is?

27:18.806 --> 27:20.808
-This is our town. -Okay, look,
I don't know where to...

27:20.841 --> 27:22.176
where to land here. Um...

27:22.209 --> 27:24.145
Ben, there's probably
something you should know

27:24.178 --> 27:25.746
-about this place.
-Yeah.

27:25.779 --> 27:29.750
This is the most, uh, wretched,

27:29.783 --> 27:32.453
godforsaken stretch of land
on the face of the earth.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.088
And I'd never leave.

27:34.121 --> 27:36.090
You know what I mean?

27:36.123 --> 27:38.726
Yeah. That's how I feel
about Twitter.

27:38.759 --> 27:40.261
-Mm.
-See, Ben's a journalist.

27:40.294 --> 27:42.062
One of the finest there is.

27:42.096 --> 27:43.764
He writes for
the <i>New York Magazine.</i>

27:43.797 --> 27:45.032
<i>New Yorker.</i> Yep.

27:45.065 --> 27:46.800
And he's gonna help us find out

27:46.834 --> 27:49.770
what really happened to Abilene.

27:49.803 --> 27:51.939
I was saying we go out
and settle with a .45,

27:51.972 --> 27:56.110
but Ben gives a whole new
perspective to the situation.

27:56.143 --> 27:59.947
Ty, you can't solve something
like this with a .45.

27:59.980 --> 28:02.116
It's not as simple
as one person.

28:02.149 --> 28:04.318
It's a whole system, son.

28:04.351 --> 28:06.187
Tell us what you mean, Granny.

28:06.220 --> 28:08.088
It's the breakdown of society,
is what it is.

28:08.122 --> 28:09.790
It's the breakdown
of the school system,

28:09.823 --> 28:11.025
-the government.
-Mm.

28:11.058 --> 28:13.928
It's the pharmaceutical
companies.

28:13.961 --> 28:16.797
It's the breakdown of the family

28:16.830 --> 28:19.233
and tradition.

28:20.267 --> 28:22.937
Oh, there's a whole lot
of people responsible

28:22.970 --> 28:25.339
-for what happened to Abilene.
-That's true.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.508
-Yes, ma'am.
-Amen.

28:26.541 --> 28:28.042
I think that's very wise.

28:28.075 --> 28:29.977
You're gonna need a 12-gauge,
couple of ARs.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.412
-No. -Yep.
-A Wesson automatic.

28:31.445 --> 28:32.880
-No, no, no.
-And a sidearm for safety.

28:32.913 --> 28:34.481
-Yep. Exactly.
-We're not doing that.

28:34.516 --> 28:36.917
Oh, we're not? Yeah.

28:38.085 --> 28:41.121
I didn't think
you had the balls.

28:41.989 --> 28:44.725
Are you gonna help us, Ben?

28:46.427 --> 28:48.862
You know, um...

28:50.798 --> 28:54.802
There's some things I'm good at.

28:54.835 --> 28:57.104
I'm good at asking
the right questions.

28:57.137 --> 28:59.240
I'm good at getting people
to talk.

28:59.273 --> 29:02.876
And I'm especially good
at drawing thematic connections

29:02.910 --> 29:04.445
between seemingly
disparate elements

29:04.478 --> 29:06.347
and using that to illustrate

29:06.380 --> 29:08.916
a larger point or theory.

29:08.949 --> 29:13.187
So, whoever or whatever

29:13.220 --> 29:16.924
is responsible
for what happened to Abilene,

29:16.957 --> 29:20.828
I will find this person

29:20.861 --> 29:24.898
or this generalized
societal force,

29:24.932 --> 29:28.235
and I will define it.

29:29.236 --> 29:31.138
I'll define it.

29:34.174 --> 29:36.043
Bless your heart.

29:42.116 --> 29:45.185
I guess we have
a guest room now.

29:47.988 --> 29:49.256
Ty.

29:50.457 --> 29:51.992
Well, rest up good.

29:52.026 --> 29:54.161
We'll meet in the morning
and start to solve this.

29:54.194 --> 29:55.329
Yeah.

29:55.362 --> 29:56.964
See you in the morning.

29:56.997 --> 29:58.932
-Good night, Ty.
-Good night.

32:08.563 --> 32:10.330
Good morning.

32:11.131 --> 32:12.567
Yeah, that's it. What else...?

32:12.600 --> 32:14.168
-Can I say it proves a lot?
-Yeah.

32:14.201 --> 32:15.737
<i>I'm gonna take</i>
<i>a short break here,</i>

32:15.770 --> 32:17.438

<i>coffee mugs.</i>

32:31.653 --> 32:34.354
Well, Ben, there's really
two versions of life out here.

32:34.388 --> 32:37.157
Boom times,
everybody's rich and busy.

32:37.191 --> 32:39.493
It's like one big party
out here.

32:39.527 --> 32:41.328
And then the bust comes.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.030
It's really like two different
places out here.

32:43.063 --> 32:45.098
It's always boom or bust.

32:45.132 --> 32:46.668
Which is it right now?

32:48.068 --> 32:49.403
Kinda in between.

32:49.436 --> 32:50.304
Yeah.

32:50.337 --> 32:52.206
Kinda in between,
to tell you the truth.

32:52.239 --> 32:53.207
Okay.

32:55.108 --> 32:57.044
You son of a...

32:57.077 --> 32:58.613
-Get off.
-Crawl. There's our worm.

32:58.646 --> 33:00.481
Oh, you like being on top.

33:00.515 --> 33:03.551
-Get off. Yeah.
-Whoo!

33:03.585 --> 33:04.686
This the guy?

33:04.719 --> 33:06.086
Yep.

33:06.119 --> 33:07.354
Hmm.

33:07.387 --> 33:09.423
Let me save you some time:
Sancholo.

33:09.456 --> 33:10.758
Sancholo. Sancholo.

33:10.792 --> 33:12.159
What's Sancholo?

33:12.192 --> 33:14.428
The guy who killed Abilene.

33:14.461 --> 33:15.763
A Mexican drug dealer.

33:15.797 --> 33:17.732
Evil motherfucker.

33:17.765 --> 33:19.366
You name it, he's got it.

33:19.399 --> 33:20.735
Not crazy about
his prices though.

33:20.768 --> 33:23.237
So, you know who killed Abilene?

33:23.270 --> 33:24.037
Yes, sir.

33:24.071 --> 33:26.574
Did you call the police
about it?

33:26.608 --> 33:28.141
Mike and Dan?

33:28.175 --> 33:29.777
Those lazy fucktards.

33:29.811 --> 33:31.111
Everything's an accident.

33:31.144 --> 33:32.112
Gun accident.

33:32.145 --> 33:33.180
Uh, driving accident.

33:33.213 --> 33:35.215
I've known Abilene

33:35.249 --> 33:37.184
since we were knee-high
to a grasshopper.

33:37.217 --> 33:39.186
She never touched
so much as an Advil,

33:39.219 --> 33:41.255
and-and then, out of the blue,

33:41.288 --> 33:44.458
they find this angel,
this angel,

33:44.491 --> 33:47.662
dead of an oxy OD
at a party he threw!

33:47.695 --> 33:49.296
Ooh, you're getting me
warmed up.

33:49.329 --> 33:51.331
He's been obsessed
with her since middle school.

33:51.365 --> 33:53.333
Yep. He'd call the house
every night.

33:53.367 --> 33:55.335
They used to be on the phone
for hours.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.070
He's just a piece of it anyway.

33:57.104 --> 33:58.806
It's too big to understand.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.576
You got deep state
in bed with pill pushers,

34:01.609 --> 34:03.645
-cartels, pedos.
-Uh-huh.

34:03.678 --> 34:05.145
-The law.
-How, wha...

34:05.178 --> 34:06.179
Hey, shh. Hey.

34:06.213 --> 34:08.415
And you're a piece of it, too.

34:09.216 --> 34:11.118
So, um, I'd love to talk

34:11.150 --> 34:12.554
to some of the characters
you mentioned.

34:12.587 --> 34:14.420
Mike and Dan? Sancholo?

34:14.454 --> 34:15.857
Oh, he's gotta be at the rodeo
in Holliston.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.291
No doubt.

34:17.324 --> 34:18.826
There and the honky-tonk,
too, afterwards.

34:18.860 --> 34:21.428
-That's where a drug dealer can
do their best business. -Mm.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.565
'Cause everybody goes
to the rodeo.

34:23.598 --> 34:25.867
White, Mexicans.

34:25.900 --> 34:29.168
You really want
to avenge her with him?

34:29.202 --> 34:30.804
I'm like a brother to you.

34:30.838 --> 34:33.306
Well, he's like
a brother-in-law.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.208
Oh, come on.

34:35.242 --> 34:37.612
Ben, you ever been in a fight?

34:37.645 --> 34:39.146
You mean like a physical fight

34:39.179 --> 34:40.581
or like an online skirmish?

34:42.884 --> 34:44.484
I got him.

34:44.518 --> 34:47.387
Crawl wouldn't hurt a fly,
would you, Crawl?

34:47.420 --> 34:50.489
I never understood
that expression about flies.

34:50.525 --> 34:52.594
Yeah, I'd kill a fly,

34:52.627 --> 34:56.263
but what kind of sick fuck
would hurt a fly?

34:56.295 --> 34:59.099
Make it feel pain? Hmm?

35:01.234 --> 35:06.340
You don't have any idea
where you are, do you?

35:06.373 --> 35:07.341
Hmm?

35:07.374 --> 35:10.110
Want me to show you a map?

35:10.878 --> 35:13.514
Welcome to Texas.

35:13.548 --> 35:15.917
You are here.

35:31.966 --> 35:33.635
Morning, KC.

35:33.668 --> 35:34.769
Hey.

35:34.802 --> 35:36.771
Uh, would you like some coffee?

35:36.804 --> 35:39.206
-Sure.
-How do you take it?

35:40.775 --> 35:42.409
In the mouth?

35:46.547 --> 35:47.915
All right, tell me something

35:47.949 --> 35:49.651
that you love
about where you live.

35:49.684 --> 35:51.786
-Whataburger!
-Whoo.

35:51.819 --> 35:53.186
-Oh. -Yeah.
-Okay, great.

35:53.220 --> 35:54.454
Um, tell me about it.

35:54.488 --> 35:55.890
-You want to go right now?
-Yeah, let's go.

35:55.923 --> 35:57.525
-Uh... Uh...
-I'm ready.

35:57.558 --> 35:59.393
-You want... -Just, no, just,
uh, tell me about it.

35:59.426 --> 36:01.529
You're gonna love Whataburger,
Ben.

36:01.562 --> 36:04.264
-Oh, it's the best.
-What makes it the best?

36:04.297 --> 36:06.934
Wherever you are,
there's a Whataburger.

36:06.968 --> 36:09.336
Yeah. It's always right there.

36:10.004 --> 36:12.272
Okay. And then
when you get there,

36:12.305 --> 36:13.941
what do you like about it?
What do you get?

36:13.975 --> 36:15.475
-Whatever you want.
-It's always right there.

36:15.510 --> 36:17.310
You could order
whatever you want, Ben.

36:17.344 --> 36:20.280
Right, but there are a lot
of places like that.

36:20.313 --> 36:22.550
So, let's say
there is a McDonald's,

36:22.583 --> 36:25.485
a Burger King, a Sonic
and a Whataburger

36:25.520 --> 36:26.721
all lined up.

36:26.754 --> 36:27.889
Which one do you go to?

36:27.922 --> 36:28.890
Whataburger!

36:28.923 --> 36:30.457
Right, right. Why?

36:30.490 --> 36:32.560
Because it's right there!

36:32.593 --> 36:34.595
Yes, but they're all
right there.

36:35.563 --> 36:39.499
In this scenario,
they're all right there.

36:39.534 --> 36:43.437
So, what do you get
out of Whataburger?

36:43.470 --> 36:45.405
What makes it better to you?

36:45.439 --> 36:47.542
-What are you getting...
-Ben.

36:48.408 --> 36:49.844
Asking why you love Whataburger

36:49.877 --> 36:51.579
is like asking
why you love Christmas

36:51.612 --> 36:54.982
or a summer night
or why you love your dog.

36:55.016 --> 36:57.284
I mean, you could point
to the reasons,

36:57.317 --> 36:59.587
but the reasons
aren't really the point.

36:59.620 --> 37:04.224
You just love it,
and that's how love works.

37:16.771 --> 37:18.039
<i>I'm on my way to get</i>

37:18.072 --> 37:20.742

38:42.957 --> 38:45.593
Yeah, that's right.

38:47.394 --> 38:50.363
Let's take a step back.

38:50.397 --> 38:52.533
I want to share an idea
with you.

38:53.433 --> 38:57.104
There's no argument
more profound

38:57.138 --> 39:00.440
than how the universe
came into existence.

39:00.473 --> 39:02.143
-Oh, God.
-Are we here because of God

39:02.176 --> 39:03.544
or science?

39:03.578 --> 39:06.848
I mean, it is,
by its very nature,

39:06.881 --> 39:09.482
the most fundamental question.

39:10.417 --> 39:14.822
But there's one thing
that everyone agrees on.

39:16.123 --> 39:19.760
And that is whether
it was God declaring,

39:19.794 --> 39:22.597
"Let there be light,"

39:22.630 --> 39:25.633
or an infinite
particle of energy

Everyone,

39:31.906 --> 39:34.542
and I mean everyone,

39:34.575 --> 39:38.913
agrees that the universe

39:38.946 --> 39:41.649
started with a sound.

39:44.785 --> 39:47.088
Why do I call myself
a record producer?

39:47.121 --> 39:49.590
I don't know.

39:49.624 --> 39:51.859
Yeah, I mean, we don't even
make records anymore.

39:53.527 --> 39:57.064
What we're recording here
isn't your record.

39:57.098 --> 39:59.499
It's your sound...

39:59.533 --> 40:03.537

40:03.571 --> 40:06.841
with the very first moment
in time.

40:07.675 --> 40:10.578
So when you sing this song...

40:12.647 --> 40:17.518
...I want you to think about
how what you're making

40:17.551 --> 40:23.490
is the record of your time
here on this earth.

40:24.592 --> 40:29.163
It's the sound that you scratch

40:29.196 --> 40:32.533
with your life...

40:33.200 --> 40:35.870
...on the record

41:24.018 --> 41:25.987
<i>I call this place the Factory.</i>

41:26.020 --> 41:28.689
-You know, after Andy Warhol's
Factory. -Hmm.

41:29.690 --> 41:31.292
Most people around here
think it's a reference

41:31.325 --> 41:33.094
to C+C Music Factory.

41:33.127 --> 41:37.298
Which, honestly, I-I think
Warhol would've loved, but...

41:37.331 --> 41:39.600
Yeah, actually. Yeah.

41:39.633 --> 41:40.768
I'm from out here.

41:40.801 --> 41:42.203
I went to college in New Haven.

41:42.236 --> 41:43.871
Oh, I went to school in Boston.

41:43.904 --> 41:45.706
Yeah, I thought about
staying there,

41:45.740 --> 41:47.842
but this is the place
that needs something like this.

41:47.875 --> 41:50.144
The problem isn't that people
aren't smart.

41:50.177 --> 41:52.246
The problem is that they are.

41:52.279 --> 41:54.048
If the landscape is like this,

41:54.081 --> 41:57.151
a-and people were just boring,
you wouldn't have this problem.

41:57.184 --> 42:00.287
The problem is, you get all
these bright, creative lights

42:00.321 --> 42:03.024
and nowhere to plug in
their energy.

42:03.057 --> 42:05.226
And so it gets channeled
into conspiracy theories

42:05.259 --> 42:07.061
and drugs and violence.

42:07.094 --> 42:09.630
Who are your favorite
music artists right now?

42:09.663 --> 42:10.931
Um...

42:10.965 --> 42:12.299
-Can I take a guess?
-Yeah.

42:12.333 --> 42:13.701
You're a playlist guy.

42:13.734 --> 42:15.302
What does that mean?

42:15.336 --> 42:16.904
When some computer
recommends you a bunch of songs

42:16.937 --> 42:19.206
based on your favorites,
and a bunch more

42:19.240 --> 42:20.741
-based on your favorites
of those. -Right.

42:20.775 --> 42:22.343
So you're listening
to a bunch of music that,

42:22.376 --> 42:24.645
-I mean, you genuinely like...
-Yeah.

42:24.678 --> 42:26.147
...but you have no idea
who sings it.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.783
Now, these playlists, it's
like the dating app for music.

42:28.816 --> 42:30.785
You're not hearing
other people's voices.

42:30.818 --> 42:33.287
You're just hearing your voice
get played back at you.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.823
How are you supposed
to fall in love?

42:36.891 --> 42:39.794
Art used to be in charge of us.

42:39.827 --> 42:41.062
You used to buy a whole album

42:41.095 --> 42:43.831
not even knowing
what songs would be on it.

42:44.765 --> 42:47.168
Now we have everything
on demand.

42:48.202 --> 42:50.805
At your fingertips.

42:50.838 --> 42:52.907
In pieces.

42:53.841 --> 42:55.810
You think half the people
that are posting quotes

42:55.843 --> 42:58.345
from Oscar Wilde have ever
actually read one of his plays?

42:58.379 --> 42:59.680
No.

42:59.713 --> 43:01.082
Or posting photos
of Audrey Hepburn

43:01.115 --> 43:03.784
have actually seen
the film that it's from?

43:03.818 --> 43:05.619
-No.
-Not a chance, right?

43:05.653 --> 43:06.954
What is that about, huh?

43:06.987 --> 43:09.824
It's the same in culture
as it is in archaeology.

43:09.857 --> 43:11.959
When a civilization collapses,

43:11.992 --> 43:14.361
only the tiniest fragments
remain.

43:14.395 --> 43:16.297
But we can build it back again.

43:16.330 --> 43:18.365
How?

43:18.399 --> 43:20.301
Make recordings.

43:20.334 --> 43:22.837
Real people.

43:22.870 --> 43:25.039
Not what people think
that they already know

43:25.072 --> 43:26.407
and want to hear.

43:26.440 --> 43:28.109
Real people.

43:28.142 --> 43:33.013
Not some generic stereotype
or generic song.

43:34.014 --> 43:36.817
Real people.

43:38.419 --> 43:40.254
What's this podcast
about anyway?

43:40.287 --> 43:42.022
Well, um, it's about America.

43:42.056 --> 43:43.057
Okay.

43:43.090 --> 43:47.128
It's about the myths
that we tell ourselves.

43:47.161 --> 43:48.195
Who is it about?

43:49.697 --> 43:51.098
All of us.

43:51.132 --> 43:54.735
Every story we tell
is ultimately about a person.

43:56.036 --> 43:57.371
Abilene Shaw.

43:57.404 --> 43:59.340
Abilene.

43:59.373 --> 44:01.142
Yeah.

44:01.175 --> 44:04.011
You're making a podcast
about Abilene.

44:04.044 --> 44:05.713
Well, it's a little
about Abilene.

44:05.746 --> 44:07.414
-I'm trying to make it
more about... -No.

44:07.448 --> 44:09.283
It's about Abilene.

44:09.316 --> 44:10.284
The person.

44:10.317 --> 44:11.719
That's all you need.

44:11.752 --> 44:13.154
What did you think
about her music?

44:13.187 --> 44:14.355
I haven't really heard it.

44:14.388 --> 44:15.890
Shut the front door.

44:15.923 --> 44:18.792
-I mean, I have...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

44:21.061 --> 44:23.664
Come with me.

44:24.298 --> 44:25.799
Here it is.

44:25.833 --> 44:27.168
Everything we ever recorded.

44:27.201 --> 44:29.069
-Thank you so much.
-You're in for a treat.

44:30.104 --> 44:32.773
Doesn't she have a sister
who wants to be a singer?

44:32.806 --> 44:34.341
Wants to be famous.

44:34.375 --> 44:36.343
Means she knows she's somebody.

44:36.377 --> 44:38.379
Just doesn't know who yet.

44:38.412 --> 44:40.814
She needs to find her voice.

44:41.482 --> 44:42.917
What about my voice?

44:42.950 --> 44:44.785
I'll put you in the studio.

44:44.818 --> 44:46.287
What do you want to do?

44:46.320 --> 44:49.089
I-I, you know...

44:49.123 --> 44:53.427
If I came here for advice
about my voice, my...

44:53.460 --> 44:56.397
you know,
my writing, my podcast,

44:56.430 --> 44:58.699
what would you tell me?

45:00.267 --> 45:04.972
I'd probably say
that nobody writes anything.

45:06.240 --> 45:08.342
All we do is translate.

45:08.375 --> 45:11.845
So if you ever get stuck and
you don't know what to say...

45:12.547 --> 45:14.715
...just listen.

45:15.282 --> 45:17.885
Even to the silences.

45:19.053 --> 45:23.924
Listen as hard as you can
to the world around you and...

45:23.958 --> 45:27.194
repeat back what you hear.

45:28.195 --> 45:30.397
That translation,

45:30.431 --> 45:32.800
that's your voice.

45:40.140 --> 45:42.243
I gotta say,
this is not anything

45:42.276 --> 45:44.111
like what I expected to find.

45:44.144 --> 45:46.347
You came here to make fun
of me, didn't you?

45:47.982 --> 45:49.416
-No, no. No.
-No, I get it's...

45:49.450 --> 45:51.118
It's... I get it.

45:51.151 --> 45:53.555
Record producer
in the middle of nowhere.

45:53.588 --> 45:56.290
You thought I'd be sillier,
smaller.

45:56.323 --> 45:58.158
I get it.

45:58.192 --> 46:00.828
Hey, look.

46:00.861 --> 46:02.363
It's already working.

46:02.396 --> 46:04.832
You listened.

46:04.865 --> 46:06.133
You learned.

46:09.370 --> 46:11.138
Welcome to Texas.

46:16.844 --> 46:19.046
Thank you.

46:30.190 --> 46:34.194
The setting sun sets Texas
afire with a glow.

46:35.062 --> 46:36.397
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

46:36.430 --> 46:39.099
It's fucking beautiful.

46:47.509 --> 46:48.976
Well, hi.

46:51.912 --> 46:53.480
Thank you.

46:53.515 --> 46:56.116
Uh, when I told my mama that
I was gonna move to New York

46:56.150 --> 46:57.918
and try and make it in music,

46:57.951 --> 47:00.921
she looked at me and she just
said, "Bless your heart."

47:00.954 --> 47:04.491
Which is Texas for, "Fuck you."

47:04.526 --> 47:06.327

Vengeance
is a unique phenomenon.

48:35.717 --> 48:37.351
<i>Texas invented vengeance.</i>

48:37.384 --> 48:40.187
<i>It makes no sense</i>
<i>if you think about it.</i>

48:40.220 --> 48:41.689
<i>Every other primal</i>
<i>human instinct</i>

48:41.723 --> 48:44.091
<i>leads to a clear</i>
<i>evolutionary reward.</i>

48:44.124 --> 48:46.093
<i>But vengeance is different.</i>

48:46.126 --> 48:47.461
<i>It's not about the future.</i>

48:47.494 --> 48:49.363
<i>It's only about the past.</i>

48:49.396 --> 48:51.498
When that massacre
happened, we didn't retreat.

48:51.533 --> 48:55.570
We didn't say, "Let's all make
sure we don't get Mexiphobia."

48:55.603 --> 48:58.071
<i>We said, "Remember the Alamo."</i>

48:58.105 --> 48:59.541
<i>It's not about hope.</i>

48:59.574 --> 49:01.275
<i>It's about regret.</i>

49:01.308 --> 49:03.444
Abby
was always creatively minded.

49:03.477 --> 49:05.580
She would make movies
with her sisters.

49:05.613 --> 49:07.114
<i>Music, of course.</i>

49:07.147 --> 49:10.384
Oh, she had such
a beautiful voice.

49:10.417 --> 49:12.486
<i>I really wish more people</i>
<i>could've heard it.</i>

49:12.520 --> 49:13.621
<i>You're a writer.</i>

49:13.655 --> 49:15.489
Anything I'd know?

49:16.591 --> 49:18.392
None of this.

49:18.425 --> 49:20.194
The desperation
that you see around here,

49:20.227 --> 49:23.063
it's not from a lack of
intelligence or creativity.

49:23.096 --> 49:24.364
It's an excess.

49:24.398 --> 49:26.200
We're not really a gun family.

49:26.233 --> 49:28.368
We have a few rifles
for shooting targets,

49:28.402 --> 49:30.204
a couple handguns
for safety, and...

49:30.237 --> 49:32.206
-And that doesn't concern you?
-Why would it concern me?

49:32.239 --> 49:34.107
There's this playwright,
Anton Chekhov,

49:34.141 --> 49:36.477
and he says that if there's
a gun in act one of a play...

49:36.511 --> 49:39.446
There's no guns in any one
of his plays I can think of.

49:39.480 --> 49:41.281
<i>Cherry Orchard,</i> no.
<i>Uncle Vanya,</i> no.

49:41.315 --> 49:42.650
I'm not actually that familiar
with his plays.

49:42.684 --> 49:44.418
Uh, I'm more familiar
with his theory.

49:44.451 --> 49:48.088
<i>But the stakes of these</i>
<i>feelings aren't hypothetical.</i>

49:48.121 --> 49:49.757
<i>They're all too real.</i>

49:49.791 --> 49:53.227
I'm your host, Ben Manalowitz,
from American Radio Collective.

49:53.260 --> 49:55.128
This is <i>Dead White Girl.</i>

49:55.162 --> 49:56.564
<i>Hey.</i>

49:56.598 --> 49:58.533
So, this is great.

49:58.566 --> 49:59.767
Really?

49:59.801 --> 50:01.168
Yeah.

50:01.201 --> 50:02.637
I'm, like, dorking out
over this family.

50:02.670 --> 50:04.171
Their family's like my family.

50:04.204 --> 50:05.507
Great. Great.

50:05.540 --> 50:06.608
Do you have any notes?

50:06.641 --> 50:08.141
Yeah. I got a couple.

50:08.175 --> 50:09.376
Thought you said you loved it.

50:09.409 --> 50:11.779
You asked if I had notes,
and I got notes,

50:11.813 --> 50:13.280
okay, first-timer?

50:13.313 --> 50:14.816
Okay. All right, all right,
what do you got?

50:14.849 --> 50:17.084
Okay, you're stepping on
people's lines,

50:17.117 --> 50:19.353
-and we need it clean, so...
-Yep, yep.

50:19.386 --> 50:21.689
Just like what you're doing
right now. Don't do that.

50:21.723 --> 50:23.090
Right.

50:23.123 --> 50:24.792
Don't talk
while they're talking.

50:24.826 --> 50:27.662
Just listen...
or pretend to listen.

50:27.695 --> 50:29.263
Okay. What else?

50:29.296 --> 50:30.698
And you know what would
help some people?

50:30.732 --> 50:33.400
If you... if you...
if you do, like, a silent laugh

50:33.433 --> 50:34.434
to egg them on.

50:34.468 --> 50:36.336
You know, like, um...

50:37.170 --> 50:39.106
Like what? I lost you.

50:39.139 --> 50:40.508
Like-- No, I'm doing it.

50:40.542 --> 50:42.142
Right, okay.

50:42.175 --> 50:44.411
Where are you going to next,
the... the rodeo?

50:44.444 --> 50:45.747
Yep, my first rodeo.

50:45.780 --> 50:47.381
I'm really excited.

50:47.414 --> 50:48.816
Apparently, it's a real
socioeconomic cross section.

50:48.850 --> 50:52.152
Yeah, and horses and bulls
and stuff.

50:54.889 --> 50:56.089
You're doing it?

50:56.123 --> 50:57.424
Yeah, could you tell?

50:57.457 --> 50:58.726
Good luck.

51:02.797 --> 51:04.431
All right, Ben.

51:04.464 --> 51:05.833
-You're gonna love this place.
-Yeah.

51:05.867 --> 51:07.467
A whole lot to see,
lot to take in.

51:07.502 --> 51:10.137
"Fourth Annual Bull Bash
Cowboy Protection."

51:10.170 --> 51:12.406
Cowboy protection
for, uh, bullfighting

51:12.439 --> 51:14.374
-in Oyster Creek, Texas.
-Cool. Excellent.

51:14.408 --> 51:16.310
<i>And, uh, you're a pitmaster.</i>

51:16.343 --> 51:17.177
Yes, sir.

51:17.210 --> 51:18.445
And what is the secret
to your success?

51:18.478 --> 51:20.748
Time and more time.

51:21.448 --> 51:24.384
--Bingo!
-Ten points!

51:26.353 --> 51:27.889
<i>Oh, hell yes!</i>

51:27.922 --> 51:29.122
<i>-Ben, you're gonna love this.</i>
<i>-All right.</i>

51:29.156 --> 51:30.223
Deep-fried Twinkies.

51:30.257 --> 51:31.291
Ben, you gotta try one of these.

51:31.325 --> 51:32.492
-Hello, beautiful.
-Oh! Hi.

51:32.527 --> 51:34.596
Can I get, uh, one, two,
three, four, five

51:34.629 --> 51:35.797
deep-fried Twinkies?

51:35.830 --> 51:37.632
Uh, can we get one
of those grilled?

51:40.233 --> 51:41.335
It's fucking good.

51:41.368 --> 51:42.870
-Fucking good.
-Yeah.

51:42.904 --> 51:44.672
Just keep a low profile, Ben.

51:44.706 --> 51:45.840
We'll find our man. No doubt.

51:45.873 --> 51:47.474
Hundred percent.

51:47.508 --> 51:50.344

Not bad, brother. Not bad.

52:46.701 --> 52:48.636
Nobody ever gets five.

52:51.438 --> 52:52.807
Right.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.475
So Six Flags, the theme park...

Exactly.

52:56.978 --> 52:58.980
-Is a Texas company.
-Right.

53:05.953 --> 53:08.221
you know what to do
when this song plays.

53:13.861 --> 53:15.863
Did you really
just try to Shazam

53:15.897 --> 53:17.899
-"Deep in the Heart of Texas"?
-Uh...

53:17.932 --> 53:19.000
No.

53:20.668 --> 53:22.704
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
who here is a die-hard fan

53:22.737 --> 53:24.839
of the University of Texas?

53:24.872 --> 53:26.774
Whoo!

53:28.609 --> 53:31.746
And who here
is a fan of Texas Tech?

53:36.818 --> 53:39.352
Okay, let's hear
from both sides.

53:39.386 --> 53:41.321
Can we have the UT fan
come down?

53:41.354 --> 53:42.590
-Good luck, buddy.
-Give them hell, Ben.

53:42.623 --> 53:44.525
Is this for real?
Are you seriou...

53:44.559 --> 53:46.326
Do you think we're joking?

53:46.359 --> 53:49.396
And let's get a Texas Tech fan.

54:00.041 --> 54:03.010
Okay, let's start with
Mr. University of Texas.

54:04.579 --> 54:06.013
Now, what's your name, son?

54:06.047 --> 54:07.481
Ben Manalowitz.

54:07.515 --> 54:09.617
What the whosit?

54:11.384 --> 54:12.920
And what do you do, son?

54:12.954 --> 54:14.589
I'm a writer.

54:14.622 --> 54:15.489
A rider?

54:15.523 --> 54:16.758
You don't look like a rider.

54:16.791 --> 54:17.859
What do you ride, son?

54:17.892 --> 54:19.493
Huh?

54:19.527 --> 54:21.028
Well, there's lots
of kinds of riding.

54:21.062 --> 54:23.798
You can ride horses,
steer, tractors.

54:23.831 --> 54:24.999
No.

54:25.032 --> 54:27.668
I'm not a rider. I'm a writer.

54:28.669 --> 54:31.304
I'm a writer.

54:31.338 --> 54:33.941
So, like, you know, uh...

54:33.975 --> 54:38.813
when... when you come across
a book or a magazine...

54:39.781 --> 54:43.450
...or even an article
that you read online.

54:44.085 --> 54:45.653
Somebody has to...

54:45.686 --> 54:48.388
has to actually think about
what those words...

54:48.421 --> 54:50.658
I know what a writer is,
you condescending asshole.

54:53.127 --> 54:54.729
Well, tell me, Shakespeare,

54:54.762 --> 54:57.932
what do you like so much about
the University of Texas?

55:01.434 --> 55:04.404
Well, I like that
it's a state school.

55:04.437 --> 55:07.407
So, it gives
financial opportunities

55:07.440 --> 55:10.511
to local people
who could use the help.

55:10.545 --> 55:14.849
And I know that it has
a very good film department.

55:14.882 --> 55:17.051
Some of the graduates include,

55:17.084 --> 55:18.786
I believe, Richard Linklater.

55:18.820 --> 55:20.988
Uh-huh. Okay.

55:21.022 --> 55:23.758
And what do you like
about Texas Tech?

55:23.791 --> 55:26.828
Quarterback Matt Harris!

55:29.597 --> 55:30.430

55:30.463 --> 55:31.933

-You going over there?
-Yeah.

56:28.022 --> 56:29.023

Excuse me, are you Sancholo?

56:50.211 --> 56:51.779
I was hoping to talk to you
for a second.

56:51.812 --> 56:53.180
You a cop?

56:53.214 --> 56:54.815
Not a cop.

56:54.849 --> 56:56.550
Cop don't have to say
he's a cop.

56:56.584 --> 56:58.619
Then why did you ask?

56:58.653 --> 57:00.187
-Right?
-'Cause you're wasting my time.

57:00.221 --> 57:02.857
Figured I might as well
waste yours.

57:02.890 --> 57:04.091
Look, I'm a journalist.

57:04.125 --> 57:05.860
I'm doing a story.

57:05.893 --> 57:07.628
I was really only hoping to
ask you a couple of questions.

57:07.662 --> 57:09.196
-I'm just trying to...
-Just trying to what?

57:09.230 --> 57:10.865
-Fucking killer!
-Hey, Ty. Relax!

57:10.898 --> 57:14.502
Guys, guys, guys, guys.
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

57:14.535 --> 57:17.538
Go easy on him.
He just lost his sister.

57:18.539 --> 57:20.473
Most beautiful girl in Texas.

57:20.508 --> 57:22.475
So what I heard was
that you were at the party

57:22.510 --> 57:23.911
where she died.

57:23.945 --> 57:25.579
Lucky me.

57:25.613 --> 57:27.748
She took her last breath

57:27.782 --> 57:29.583
on my shoulder.

57:32.086 --> 57:33.688
My name is Ben Manalowitz.

57:33.721 --> 57:35.589
I'm doing a podcast
about Abilene.

57:35.623 --> 57:38.726
I would love to hear
your side of the story.

57:39.593 --> 57:40.594
Hey.

57:40.628 --> 57:42.697
We got a regular Joe Rogan here.

57:42.730 --> 57:45.166
Joe Rogan meets Seth Rogen.

57:50.004 --> 57:51.939
Just you.

58:27.174 --> 58:29.744
When I was in middle school,

58:29.777 --> 58:33.314
my mom wouldn't let me
read <i>Harry Potter</i>

58:33.347 --> 58:35.683
because of church stuff.

58:35.716 --> 58:41.122
So I would call Abby
every night.

58:41.155 --> 58:43.124
She would read it to me.

58:47.728 --> 58:50.064
I don't know what made her
care about me.

58:50.097 --> 58:51.599
I was like, "Why me?

58:51.632 --> 58:54.168
I'm just an effing
dropout drug dealer."

58:54.201 --> 58:57.838
She'd say, "Heart sees heart."

58:57.872 --> 58:59.740
Right.

58:59.774 --> 59:01.042
She used to text that to me

59:01.075 --> 59:05.846
every day on that dumbass
little Razr phone.

59:05.880 --> 59:07.281
-You remember those?
-Yeah.

59:07.314 --> 59:09.750
5-4-5.

59:11.018 --> 59:12.820
Heart sees heart.

59:12.853 --> 59:14.889
It was, like, her little code.

59:17.391 --> 59:19.060
I miss her so much.

59:20.694 --> 59:23.697
You told me that her last
breath was on your shoulder.

59:23.731 --> 59:24.932
And other people told me

59:24.965 --> 59:26.367
that you threw the party
where she died.

59:26.400 --> 59:29.103
I wasn't even there.

59:30.104 --> 59:32.039
Okay.

59:32.073 --> 59:34.108
Where were you?

59:39.980 --> 59:41.782
Look at the date.

59:48.089 --> 59:49.190
Where is this?

59:49.223 --> 59:52.093
Tulsa. I went to see Adele.

59:53.761 --> 59:55.096
I was there with my niece.

59:55.129 --> 59:56.831
She... She loves her.

59:56.864 --> 59:57.932
Adele?

59:57.965 --> 59:59.834
Obviously,
I'm gonna have to kill you

59:59.867 --> 01:00:00.835
if you tell anyone about that.

01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:02.703
No, it's...

01:00:03.304 --> 01:00:04.905
Yeah.

01:00:04.939 --> 01:00:06.907
I'm a fan.

01:00:09.143 --> 01:00:11.679
So...

01:00:11.712 --> 01:00:12.980
you have an alibi,

01:00:13.013 --> 01:00:15.316
but you want people to think
you killed her?

01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:17.118
These fucking cartels, man.

01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:18.886
They're gonna control
everything pretty soon.

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:21.856
-You're the cartels.
-No, sir.

01:00:21.889 --> 01:00:24.024
It kills me to claim her,

01:00:24.058 --> 01:00:26.727
but I don't know.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:29.396
If they don't actually think
I killed someone,

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.233
then I might have
to kill someone...

01:00:33.434 --> 01:00:34.835
...to prove myself.

01:00:34.869 --> 01:00:36.403
That's not really
how it works, is it?

01:00:36.437 --> 01:00:37.872
It's what I heard.

01:00:37.905 --> 01:00:39.406
Go on Snopes.
It's not a real thing.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:40.908
Excuse me?

01:00:41.942 --> 01:00:44.278
So, let me piece this together.
She OD'd...

01:00:44.311 --> 01:00:46.147
The fuck? This is Abby
we're talking about here, okay?

01:00:46.180 --> 01:00:47.948
She wouldn't touch the stuff.

01:00:47.982 --> 01:00:49.917
Girl wouldn't touch an Advil.

01:00:51.385 --> 01:00:54.955
Listen, they found her two and
a half miles from the party,

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:56.690
at a spot where
all the deaths happen

01:00:56.724 --> 01:00:58.025
called "the Afterparty."

01:00:58.058 --> 01:01:01.162
You don't just wander off
like that by yourself.

01:01:01.195 --> 01:01:02.997
Someone takes you there.

01:01:04.465 --> 01:01:06.333
This was no OD.

01:01:06.367 --> 01:01:07.868
No fucking way.

01:01:10.204 --> 01:01:12.273
Who goes to these parties?

01:01:12.306 --> 01:01:13.774
Everybody.

01:01:13.807 --> 01:01:15.943
-Everybody goes. Nobody went.
-Yeah.

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:19.146
-Same people every time?
-Yes.

01:01:20.881 --> 01:01:22.716
When's the next one?

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.686
Whenever I want.

01:01:34.128 --> 01:01:36.197
You're at 11%, bro.

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:38.732
You might want to switch
to low power mode.

01:01:39.333 --> 01:01:41.235
Thank you.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:55.916
Hello?

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.818
What if she was murdered?

01:01:59.286 --> 01:02:00.955
What?

01:02:00.988 --> 01:02:02.089
We dismissed
the first theory presented

01:02:02.122 --> 01:02:03.490
without even thinking about it.

01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:05.259
What if we're not taking
them seriously?

01:02:05.292 --> 01:02:10.231
Wait, so are you saying
the Mexican drug dealer did it?

01:02:10.264 --> 01:02:11.498
Definitely not that.

01:02:11.533 --> 01:02:13.000
But that was
the first theory presented.

01:02:13.033 --> 01:02:16.103
I'm just sure it wasn't that.

01:02:16.136 --> 01:02:18.239
Why are you so sure?

01:02:18.272 --> 01:02:19.773
Gut.

01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:21.509
-Gut?
-Look,

01:02:21.543 --> 01:02:23.143
I know we liked
what we had before.

01:02:23.177 --> 01:02:26.247
Something about America
and fantasy and regret

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.515
and the meaning of vengeance.

01:02:27.549 --> 01:02:31.018
No, no. This... this is better.

01:02:32.186 --> 01:02:34.154
This just keeps getting
bigger and bigger.

01:02:35.122 --> 01:02:36.257
Right?

01:02:36.290 --> 01:02:37.358
Okay.

01:02:37.391 --> 01:02:39.126
Stay safe.

01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:40.461
Get the story.

01:02:40.494 --> 01:02:41.862
Not in that order.

01:02:41.895 --> 01:02:43.831
No. In that order.

01:03:12.560 --> 01:03:14.529
What are you watching?

01:03:14.562 --> 01:03:18.932
Um, videos of Abilene.

01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:23.904
Do you see my phone?

01:03:24.539 --> 01:03:26.440
How it's, like, cracked.

01:03:26.473 --> 01:03:27.941
Yeah.

01:03:27.975 --> 01:03:31.145
It makes me look
the way that I feel.

01:03:32.614 --> 01:03:35.382
Um...

01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:39.353
<i>Where do I know you from?</i>

01:03:39.386 --> 01:03:40.588
Rodeo.

01:03:40.622 --> 01:03:42.256
It's the Longhorns fan.

01:03:42.289 --> 01:03:44.592
Indeed it is, Mike.
Indeed it is.

01:03:44.626 --> 01:03:46.594
Actually,
that was a misunderstanding.

01:03:46.628 --> 01:03:48.329
I'm sorry.
I'm not even a football fan.

01:03:48.362 --> 01:03:50.331
Um, I was just trying to fit in.

01:03:50.364 --> 01:03:52.199
Funny way to fit in around here.

01:03:52.232 --> 01:03:53.233
Point taken.

01:03:53.267 --> 01:03:55.969
I didn't know there
was gonna be another team.

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:58.038
I was cheering for Texas.

01:04:00.107 --> 01:04:00.974
Um...

01:04:01.008 --> 01:04:02.876
I'd love to ask you
a couple questions

01:04:02.910 --> 01:04:04.478
about the death of Abilene Shaw.

01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:06.080
-OD'd.
-Accident.

01:04:06.113 --> 01:04:07.348
I know that was
the official report.

01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:09.483
I was wondering,
were you able to talk to anyone

01:04:09.517 --> 01:04:11.151
who was there
the night she died?

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:14.622
You ever go to a party
out by the pump jacks?

01:04:14.656 --> 01:04:17.958
Everybody goes
and nobody was there.

01:04:17.991 --> 01:04:19.426
I wasn't there.

01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:20.528
I wasn't there.

01:04:22.564 --> 01:04:25.165
Why are you so interested
anyway?

01:04:25.199 --> 01:04:27.401
You her, uh, boyfriend
or something?

01:04:28.402 --> 01:04:31.372
Uh, we hung out.

01:04:31.405 --> 01:04:33.240
Yeah. Yeah, I was her boyfriend.

01:04:33.273 --> 01:04:35.677
Well, you know, 90% of the time
it's the boyfriend who did it.

01:04:35.710 --> 01:04:37.378
Okay, I wasn't...
I wasn't really her boyfriend.

01:04:37.411 --> 01:04:39.980
His story's starting to sound
a little inconsistent.

01:04:40.013 --> 01:04:41.982
Swiss cheese.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:44.686
Yeah, um, I'm not trying
to cause any problems here.

01:04:44.719 --> 01:04:46.353
I'm really just trying
to help the family.

01:04:46.387 --> 01:04:48.656
You know, this isn't even
our jurisdiction anyways.

01:04:50.157 --> 01:04:51.458
Party happened outside
city limits.

01:04:51.492 --> 01:04:53.460
-Mm.
-That's county, not city.

01:04:53.494 --> 01:04:55.062
-County sheriff.
-Sheriff'll talk.

01:04:55.095 --> 01:04:56.430
Sheriff's a politician.

01:04:56.463 --> 01:04:58.232
Ain't that a fact.

01:04:58.265 --> 01:05:00.934
I'd love to help you, son, but
our policy is we can't comment

01:05:00.968 --> 01:05:03.003
on our process or cases.

01:05:03.036 --> 01:05:06.106
Well, I was interviewing people
for a podcast

01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.675
that could be heard
by millions of people.

01:05:07.709 --> 01:05:10.911
But I guess that's
not a possibility.

01:05:11.579 --> 01:05:12.647
These are oxy sticks.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.281
See how the pills
are squared off?

01:05:14.314 --> 01:05:16.551
That way, they can pack 'em
in boxes to the corners

01:05:16.584 --> 01:05:18.686
-without wasting any space.
-Mm-hmm.

01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.555
That's how big this business is.

01:05:20.588 --> 01:05:22.156
We don't know who's shipping it.

01:05:22.189 --> 01:05:23.725
All we know is they're coming
along the interstate

01:05:23.758 --> 01:05:25.259
right along the border.

01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:27.428
And that route
cuts right by the oil field

01:05:27.461 --> 01:05:29.029
where the party was.

01:05:29.062 --> 01:05:30.532
The most common
overdose spot in the county.

01:05:30.565 --> 01:05:32.667
We call it "the Afterparty."

01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:34.968
Very common thing, sad to say.

01:05:36.036 --> 01:05:37.572
What's this right here?

01:05:37.605 --> 01:05:40.307
Looks like two pairs of prints.

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:41.341
Cowboy boots.

01:05:42.544 --> 01:05:45.312
Calling out an APB to find
two men wearing cowboy boots.

01:05:48.348 --> 01:05:50.050
-Okay.
-What the fuck?

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:52.186
Stand down.

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:54.556
Son, I wish you well,
I really do.

01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:56.056
And bless your little heart,

01:05:56.089 --> 01:05:58.225
but this ain't even
our jurisdiction, though.

01:05:59.059 --> 01:06:00.160
-It's not?
-No, sir.

01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:02.062
This was along the highway.

01:06:02.095 --> 01:06:04.131
You want to talk
to highway patrol.

01:06:05.332 --> 01:06:07.067
Well, ain't that just like
a sheriff to puff his hot air

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:09.236
and blow you
straight into my office.

01:06:09.269 --> 01:06:10.738
If there's a drug overdose
at a party

01:06:10.772 --> 01:06:12.339
in some fucking field off 29,

01:06:12.372 --> 01:06:14.709
I'm sorry,
but we got shit to do.

01:06:14.742 --> 01:06:16.511
We're not a bunch
of Army rejects

01:06:16.544 --> 01:06:18.412
just gazing at the Rio Grande.

01:06:18.445 --> 01:06:20.548
-I never said that you were.
-I wasn't talking about us.

01:06:20.582 --> 01:06:23.283
Oh, is that what they told you
over at highway patrol?

01:06:23.317 --> 01:06:25.185
Well, you can go tell
Junior Brown

01:06:25.219 --> 01:06:27.221
and the rest of them
glorified meter maids

01:06:27.254 --> 01:06:29.757
that if they spent more time
with their real guns

01:06:29.791 --> 01:06:31.492
and less with their radar guns,

01:06:31.526 --> 01:06:34.261
we might not have to chase
the goddamn Texas syndicate

01:06:34.294 --> 01:06:36.230
up and down the Trans-Pecos!

01:06:36.263 --> 01:06:36.898
Got it?

01:06:36.931 --> 01:06:39.099
Yes. If I find a natural way

01:06:39.132 --> 01:06:40.702
to work that into
the conversation with them,

01:06:40.735 --> 01:06:41.736
I will do that.

01:06:41.769 --> 01:06:43.638
-DRT.
-DRT.

01:06:43.671 --> 01:06:45.507
-DRT.
-Dead right there.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.475
Law
enforcement was no help at all.

01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:51.779
You're learning a lot
down there, aren't you?

01:06:51.813 --> 01:06:54.181
The murder or overdose
happened where a lot

01:06:54.214 --> 01:06:55.650
of these things happen.

01:06:55.683 --> 01:06:57.652
At the intersection of four
overlapping jurisdictions.

01:06:57.685 --> 01:06:59.152
So they all kicked it
to each other.

01:06:59.186 --> 01:07:01.054
What are the odds?

01:07:01.088 --> 01:07:03.758
What are the odds?

01:07:03.791 --> 01:07:05.527
Okay, I'm gonna kick this around

01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:08.161
with the team for a little bit,
shake up the Boggle board,

01:07:08.195 --> 01:07:11.131
and then I'm gonna hit up Robin
to get her thoughts.

01:07:11.164 --> 01:07:13.133
All right. Thanks, Eloise.
Thanks, everybody.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:15.369
-Bye, Ben.
-Bye, Ben.

01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:23.477
Um, you're probably not even
gonna watch this,

01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:29.249
but I'm back home in Texas,
and I'm bored.

01:07:29.283 --> 01:07:31.084
This is my little brother,
Mason.

01:07:31.118 --> 01:07:32.352
He sleeps on my floor

01:07:32.386 --> 01:07:34.087
because he's afraid of ghosts.

01:07:34.121 --> 01:07:36.290
And I tried to tell him

01:07:36.323 --> 01:07:38.492
there's no such thing
as ghosts, but whatever.

01:07:38.526 --> 01:07:40.728
It keeps him close to me.

01:07:41.629 --> 01:07:44.331
So I guess it's not all bad
being here.

01:07:45.399 --> 01:07:47.100
That's, um...

01:07:47.134 --> 01:07:49.136
Well, that's it.

01:07:56.476 --> 01:07:58.211
Mason.

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:00.515
Yes, sir?

01:08:04.752 --> 01:08:06.754
Just saying good night.

01:08:06.788 --> 01:08:10.490
You woke me up
just to say good night?

01:08:11.626 --> 01:08:13.427
Yes, sir.

01:08:17.599 --> 01:08:20.334
I love you mucho.

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:43.917
Hey.

01:09:43.951 --> 01:09:45.886
Guess who's on the line.

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.421
Hey. It's Robin.

01:09:47.453 --> 01:09:48.723
I produce <i>American Moment.</i>

01:09:48.756 --> 01:09:50.725
Yeah. I-I know who you are.

01:09:50.758 --> 01:09:52.492
It's-it's, um...
It's great to meet you, Robin.

01:09:52.527 --> 01:09:54.361
-How are you?
-Great to talk to you.

01:09:54.394 --> 01:09:56.698
I love what you're doing
with <i>Dead White Girl.</i>

01:09:56.731 --> 01:09:58.733
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:09:58.766 --> 01:10:00.968
Eloise pitched that
we use some of the story

01:10:01.002 --> 01:10:03.004
as a segment on <i>American Moment,</i>

01:10:03.037 --> 01:10:04.906
and that would help promote
your series.

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.974
Wow. So it'd be
on <i>American Moment.</i>

01:10:07.008 --> 01:10:08.976
Everything you're getting
is great.

01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:10.611
The characters are amazing.

01:10:10.645 --> 01:10:12.379
Yeah. No, I mean, the
characters are unbelievable.

01:10:12.412 --> 01:10:13.715
Ty is just a total firecracker.

01:10:13.748 --> 01:10:15.850
And Granny
deserves her own show.

01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:18.452
And then Abilene, I mean...

01:10:18.485 --> 01:10:20.487
The more people hear her voice,

01:10:20.521 --> 01:10:22.456
the more they're gonna
fall in love with her.

01:10:22.489 --> 01:10:24.659
So if you think you can
tighten up what you have,

01:10:24.692 --> 01:10:27.695
we can work it
into Sunday's episode.

01:10:28.663 --> 01:10:30.631
Yeah. I... Absolutely.

01:10:30.665 --> 01:10:31.866
I'd love to.

01:10:31.899 --> 01:10:33.668
Wow. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that.

01:10:33.701 --> 01:10:35.937
Can I ask what you're eating?

01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:37.772
This is, um, Frito pie.

01:10:37.805 --> 01:10:38.906
It's great sound.

01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:40.273
What is that?

01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:41.943
Uh, Frito pie

01:10:41.976 --> 01:10:44.344
is when they cut open
a bag of Fritos

01:10:44.377 --> 01:10:45.613
and they pour chili in it.

01:10:45.646 --> 01:10:46.948
Then you eat it out of the bag
with a fork.

01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:48.049
Ugh. That is disgusting.

01:10:48.082 --> 01:10:49.517
Yeah, in a good way.

01:10:51.384 --> 01:10:53.688
Ben, are you there?

01:10:53.721 --> 01:10:56.791
Ben, did I lose you?

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.633
What happened to you, son?

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:08.803
My Prius exploded.

01:11:08.836 --> 01:11:10.303
Mm-hmm.

01:11:14.374 --> 01:11:15.977
Oh, thank heavens.
Are you all right?

01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:17.578
Hey.

01:11:17.612 --> 01:11:19.080
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at that.

01:11:19.113 --> 01:11:20.648
-Oh, hey.
-What happened?

01:11:20.681 --> 01:11:23.450
-I'm fine.
-His car blew up, Mom!

01:11:23.483 --> 01:11:24.786
Oh, it's so fucked up! This...

01:11:24.819 --> 01:11:26.386
-Tyler Clayton!
-Sorry.

01:11:26.419 --> 01:11:27.755
We're just so grateful
you're all right.

01:11:27.789 --> 01:11:30.323
Oh, my God. What if you were
driving a real car

01:11:30.357 --> 01:11:31.526
with gas and stuff?

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:34.529
Yeah.

01:11:34.562 --> 01:11:36.831
Ben, this is a message
that we're getting close.

01:11:36.864 --> 01:11:41.301
Or it's kids fucking around
for no reason with Tannerite.

01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.608
I can't believe you're all here.

01:11:47.642 --> 01:11:50.477
Well, where else would we be?

01:11:50.511 --> 01:11:52.847
Come on. The girls are waiting
in the car.

01:11:53.848 --> 01:11:55.382
Let's go.

01:11:55.415 --> 01:11:56.483
-Hey, are you limping?
-No.

01:11:56.517 --> 01:11:57.819
You sure about that?

01:11:57.852 --> 01:11:59.587
-Come on, Mama.
-Yeah. His face looks all right.

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:01.656
-He's gonna be all right.
-Yeah, I seen worse.

01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:03.490
Come on, buddy.

01:12:03.524 --> 01:12:04.992

<i>-So good.</i>

01:12:06.594 --> 01:12:08.830
And this is his first time
at Whataburger.

01:12:11.132 --> 01:12:12.700
-Let's have a toast.
-Thank you.

01:12:12.733 --> 01:12:14.434
-To Ben. -Come on, to Ben.
-To Ben.

01:12:14.467 --> 01:12:15.570
-Whataburger, Whataburger.
-To a good milkshake.

01:12:15.603 --> 01:12:16.871
-Whoopah.
-Over there.

01:12:16.904 --> 01:12:17.905
Thanks.

01:12:18.973 --> 01:12:22.076
Well, what do you think?

01:12:22.109 --> 01:12:23.845
I love this.

01:12:23.878 --> 01:12:25.146
You do?

01:12:25.179 --> 01:12:28.850
And it's always right there.

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:36.691
-Excuse me, Mama.
-Ooh.

01:12:36.724 --> 01:12:38.391
Mm.

01:12:38.425 --> 01:12:39.961
It's a Texas thing.

01:12:39.994 --> 01:12:41.629
You're not supposed to do it,
but you're supposed to do it.

01:12:41.662 --> 01:12:43.731
You're supposed to take
your lucky number,

01:12:43.764 --> 01:12:46.000
but we figure every number's
lucky to somebody,

01:12:46.033 --> 01:12:47.602
so we take all of 'em.

01:12:47.635 --> 01:12:49.103
I won't tell Mike and Dan.

01:12:49.136 --> 01:12:50.403
Like they'd do anything.

01:12:50.437 --> 01:12:51.906
They'd say it was an accident.

01:12:53.174 --> 01:12:54.642
Party tonight.

01:12:54.675 --> 01:12:56.878
-Oh, what's the dress code?
-Ugh.

01:12:56.911 --> 01:12:58.846
Broncos and buckle bunnies.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.548
Ugh. You know,
they're seriously phoning it in

01:13:00.581 --> 01:13:01.916
with the themes nowadays.

01:13:01.949 --> 01:13:03.150
You want to come tonight?

01:13:03.184 --> 01:13:04.151
You can borrow something
from my closet.

01:13:04.185 --> 01:13:05.686
You're okay to go?

01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:08.455
It doesn't stir up
too many feelings for you?

01:13:10.157 --> 01:13:12.059
You gotta keep living life.

01:13:12.093 --> 01:13:13.694
Like Catherine the Great said,

01:13:13.728 --> 01:13:15.930
"You gotta get right back
under the horse."

01:13:16.797 --> 01:13:18.733
Tyler Clayton.
-What?

01:13:18.766 --> 01:13:22.169
I-I listened to that history
podcast you recommended.

01:13:22.203 --> 01:13:23.638
I've got a question for you.

01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:26.040
Have you got family in Texas?

01:13:26.073 --> 01:13:27.675
No.

01:13:27.708 --> 01:13:29.510
You do now.

01:13:29.543 --> 01:13:31.579
-Isn't that right, everybody?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:13:31.612 --> 01:13:34.081
Careful what you wish for, Ben.

01:13:37.952 --> 01:13:39.654
One second.

01:13:39.687 --> 01:13:41.454
Who's got a honey thing
over there?

01:13:41.488 --> 01:13:43.991
-Um, I got some right here.
-Anybody? Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:13:44.025 --> 01:13:46.527
-Hey. What's up?
-Hey.

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.929
Your car blew up?

01:13:47.962 --> 01:13:49.664
Are you okay?

01:13:49.697 --> 01:13:50.731
Yeah. Yes.

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:53.200
I mean, I wish I got
that extra rental insurance

01:13:53.234 --> 01:13:55.468
that no one ever gets,
but I'm fine.

01:13:55.503 --> 01:13:57.238
Good. Well, listen,
I finished it,

01:13:57.271 --> 01:13:58.639
and everyone loves it.

01:13:58.673 --> 01:14:00.207
Thanks. What do you mean
"finished it"?

01:14:00.241 --> 01:14:01.809
You're clearly in danger,

01:14:01.842 --> 01:14:04.679
and you've already got
everything you need.

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:08.082
Well, I didn't solve the murder.

01:14:08.115 --> 01:14:09.850
It's better this way.

01:14:09.884 --> 01:14:12.887
You know, an ambiguous ending
without resolution.

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.158
That's... that's the secret
weapon with a story like this.

01:14:17.191 --> 01:14:18.526
It gnaws at you.

01:14:18.559 --> 01:14:21.162
It haunts you forever.

01:14:21.195 --> 01:14:22.563
You never let it go.

01:14:22.596 --> 01:14:23.698
No, there's more to it, Eloise.

01:14:23.731 --> 01:14:24.966
I-I'm getting so close.

01:14:24.999 --> 01:14:26.701
As much as we'd love to see you

01:14:26.734 --> 01:14:28.703
-blown up for a story...
-No, no.

01:14:28.736 --> 01:14:30.237
...my conscience tells me

01:14:30.271 --> 01:14:32.173
I have to choose a person
over a story.

01:14:32.206 --> 01:14:33.908
No.

01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:35.009
No, no.

01:14:35.042 --> 01:14:38.713
Otherwise, it would take,
like, two years of therapy

01:14:38.746 --> 01:14:41.115
to justify it, and...

01:14:41.148 --> 01:14:43.551
I can't afford that on my plan.

01:14:43.584 --> 01:14:46.020
Look, you're gonna be huge
from this.

01:14:46.053 --> 01:14:47.188
Okay?

01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:48.255
Come home.

01:14:52.827 --> 01:14:54.996
-You remember?
-Hey, you.

01:14:55.029 --> 01:14:56.764
Hey. Sorry about that.

01:14:56.797 --> 01:14:58.265
Who was that?

01:14:58.299 --> 01:15:00.267
Friend.

01:15:00.301 --> 01:15:02.003
Was it Equinox Girl Cute?

01:15:02.036 --> 01:15:03.804
Or was it Natalie Bumble?

01:15:03.838 --> 01:15:05.740
Uh, it was, uh,
my podcast producer.

01:15:05.773 --> 01:15:08.743
Uh, and everything's on track.

01:15:08.776 --> 01:15:10.277
You're very sweet to ask.

01:15:10.311 --> 01:15:12.213
I love you mucho.

01:15:12.246 --> 01:15:14.715
We're so lucky
you found Abilene.

01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:18.085
I really don't know
what she saw in me.

01:15:18.119 --> 01:15:19.286
I do.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:21.655
I get it. I totally get it.

01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:24.558
-Heart sees heart.
-Oh.

01:15:25.359 --> 01:15:30.064
You know, when I came down here
to spend time with Abby's...

01:15:30.097 --> 01:15:31.632
"Crazy Texan family," right?

01:15:31.665 --> 01:15:32.967
Yeah.

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:37.038
Uh, I never thought
it would be like this.

01:15:37.071 --> 01:15:38.773
People can surprise you.

01:15:38.806 --> 01:15:40.174
Yeah.

01:15:40.207 --> 01:15:41.642
Like Abilene.

01:15:41.675 --> 01:15:43.077
I mean,
she was full of surprises.

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:44.712
-Like Abilene.
-Mm-hmm.

01:15:44.745 --> 01:15:48.182
Great reputation,
but a huge pill-popper.

01:15:53.254 --> 01:15:55.189
What?

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:56.724
What'd you just say?

01:15:56.757 --> 01:15:59.060
Mm. Put that in
your podcast, maybe.

01:15:59.093 --> 01:16:00.361
Where'd you hear that?

01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:02.630
The girls told me.

01:16:08.135 --> 01:16:10.805
Ty told us not to say anything.

01:16:24.685 --> 01:16:26.854
Are you fucking serious?

01:16:27.755 --> 01:16:30.357
I thought you wouldn't
do this with me

01:16:30.391 --> 01:16:32.093
if you knew that she was using.

01:16:32.126 --> 01:16:33.761
You think?

01:16:33.794 --> 01:16:35.029
Drugs was something Abilene did.

01:16:35.062 --> 01:16:36.297
It's not who she was.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:37.765
But it is how she died,

01:16:37.798 --> 01:16:39.867
which is what
we were investigating.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:41.268
I thought there was more
to this.

01:16:41.302 --> 01:16:42.770
I thought that you and I
would get to know each other,

01:16:42.803 --> 01:16:44.071
and that would be cool.

01:16:44.105 --> 01:16:46.373
I... Maybe it was part
of the grieving process.

01:16:46.407 --> 01:16:47.975
Denial?

01:16:48.008 --> 01:16:50.044
Isn't that one of the 12 steps
of grief?

01:16:50.077 --> 01:16:52.379
It's five stages of grief,
12 steps to recovery,

01:16:52.413 --> 01:16:54.148
but I understand
that everyone here

01:16:54.181 --> 01:16:55.282
is more familiar
with the latter.

01:16:55.316 --> 01:16:56.650
It's complicated.

01:16:56.684 --> 01:16:58.018
It's not.
It's actually very simple.

01:16:58.052 --> 01:17:01.288
Everything here
is actually really simple,

01:17:01.322 --> 01:17:03.190
and maybe that's why
it took me so long

01:17:03.224 --> 01:17:04.758
to understand it.

01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:07.328
Well, I was following my heart,

01:17:07.361 --> 01:17:09.130
and that's what we do
around here.

01:17:09.163 --> 01:17:11.031
You follow your heart.

01:17:11.065 --> 01:17:12.633
Yeah.

01:17:13.334 --> 01:17:15.269
Well, maybe
it's time to look around

01:17:15.302 --> 01:17:18.305
and ask yourselves
how that's working out for you.

01:17:18.339 --> 01:17:21.742
Maybe you should try following
your brain for a change.

01:17:21.775 --> 01:17:24.011
Because when you follow
your heart,

01:17:24.044 --> 01:17:25.679
the Earth is flat,

01:17:25.713 --> 01:17:27.281
climate change is a hoax,

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:30.151
vaccines contain microchips,

01:17:30.184 --> 01:17:33.754
and Mexican drug dealers
killed your sister.

01:17:33.787 --> 01:17:36.891
You invent these insane
fucking narratives

01:17:36.924 --> 01:17:39.160
to explain why your lives
are such shit shows

01:17:39.193 --> 01:17:42.096
because the truth
is too scary for you to face,

01:17:42.129 --> 01:17:44.899
which is that you did it
to yourselves.

01:17:44.932 --> 01:17:47.735
Do you know what people say
about you guys where I'm from?

01:17:47.768 --> 01:17:50.304
-Let me guess. Bad things.
-No. Worse.

01:17:50.337 --> 01:17:52.273
We say good things.

01:17:52.306 --> 01:17:53.474
"We took them seriously

01:17:53.508 --> 01:17:54.708
when we should've
taken them literally."

01:17:54.742 --> 01:17:55.876
You're neither.

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:57.444
You're not serious people.

01:17:57.478 --> 01:17:59.780
And maybe it's time for you all

01:17:59.813 --> 01:18:01.815
to take us seriously
and literally

01:18:01.849 --> 01:18:04.885
because where I'm from
is fun and interesting.

01:18:04.919 --> 01:18:07.855
And the people are rich
and diverse,

01:18:07.888 --> 01:18:12.793
and, meanwhile,
your town looks like this!

01:18:12.826 --> 01:18:14.228
Bless your heart.

01:18:14.261 --> 01:18:15.429
Oh, and I know what that means.

01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:17.498
So you know what?
Bless your heart.

01:18:17.532 --> 01:18:20.100
Bless your heart.
Bless all your hearts.

01:18:20.134 --> 01:18:22.203
All your hearts
can go bless themselves.

01:18:22.236 --> 01:18:24.471
Who are you to talk to us?

01:18:24.506 --> 01:18:28.175
I had to drag you
to her fucking funeral!

01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:34.014
Who are you?

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:36.083
If your car would've blown up
in Brooklyn,

01:18:36.116 --> 01:18:40.955
would anyone--
anyone come to help you?

01:18:40.988 --> 01:18:43.324
First of all, I wouldn't have
needed a car in Brooklyn.

01:18:43.357 --> 01:18:46.360
Second, if I had one, I doubt
it would've been blown up

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:48.862
by God knows who.

01:18:48.896 --> 01:18:50.898
I don't understand you people.

01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:52.866
"You people"
is a microaggression.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.802
My apologies. Y'all.

01:18:54.835 --> 01:18:57.137
"Y'all" is a cultural
appropriation.

01:18:57.171 --> 01:18:59.139
Paris...

01:18:59.173 --> 01:19:02.476
you accusing someone
of cultural appropriation

01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:04.478
is cultural appropriation.

01:19:04.512 --> 01:19:07.381
Why wouldn't you look after her?

01:19:07.414 --> 01:19:09.250
Check in on her?

01:19:09.283 --> 01:19:11.785
You wouldn't do anything
for her, would you?

01:19:11.819 --> 01:19:14.021
That's right. I wouldn't.

01:19:14.054 --> 01:19:16.558
I was hooking up
with different people,

01:19:16.591 --> 01:19:18.993
and I assumed she was, too,

01:19:19.026 --> 01:19:22.296
because I live
in the real world,

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:25.032
and that's what everybody does.

01:19:25.065 --> 01:19:27.835
I tried to tell you this
when you called.

01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:29.803
She wasn't my girlfriend.

01:19:29.837 --> 01:19:32.940
She was just a girl in my phone.

01:19:40.948 --> 01:19:43.050
Now you've been in a fight.

01:19:56.063 --> 01:19:58.065
I don't know the whole story...

01:19:59.466 --> 01:20:01.201
...but life is complicated.

01:20:01.235 --> 01:20:04.204
Even around here,
if you can believe that.

01:20:05.472 --> 01:20:07.341
I'll tell you what I think.

01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:12.012
I think people don't do drugs
for no reason.

01:20:12.046 --> 01:20:14.315
They do drugs
because they're in pain.

01:20:14.348 --> 01:20:16.183
Pain like...

01:20:16.216 --> 01:20:19.219
like maybe caring for someone
who hardly knows your name.

01:20:20.622 --> 01:20:22.956
So, I don't know, Ben.

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:25.326
But if you're still looking
for someone to blame

01:20:25.359 --> 01:20:27.928
for what happened...

01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:31.231
you may not have needed
to come all this way.

01:20:35.269 --> 01:20:37.204
Bless your heart.

01:21:40.167 --> 01:21:42.236
<i>You were right, Eloise.</i>

01:21:42.269 --> 01:21:45.005
<i>I was the story.</i>

01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:47.575
A self-absorbed know-it-all

01:21:47.609 --> 01:21:52.246
thinks he's gonna figure out
the meaning of America,

01:21:52.279 --> 01:21:55.916
and all he learns
is how empty he is.

01:21:57.752 --> 01:22:00.320
I was the one living a myth.

01:22:03.023 --> 01:22:06.193
They say you regret
the things you don't do.

01:22:07.595 --> 01:22:09.963
I didn't love.

01:22:13.066 --> 01:22:15.570
I have no story.

01:22:15.603 --> 01:22:18.238
I guess that's the story.

01:22:18.272 --> 01:22:21.975
I am the story,
and the story sucks.

01:22:22.009 --> 01:22:25.012
The story is nothing.

01:22:25.647 --> 01:22:28.182
I'm coming home.

01:22:32.486 --> 01:22:34.589
I'm scared.

01:22:34.622 --> 01:22:36.558
What are you scared of?

01:22:36.591 --> 01:22:38.492
Ghosts.

01:22:38.526 --> 01:22:40.394
Ghosts aren't real.

01:22:40.427 --> 01:22:44.164
If they're not real, how come
everyone knows what they are?

01:22:44.198 --> 01:22:48.101
They're real as an idea,
but they're not real, real.

01:22:48.135 --> 01:22:52.039
That's what's scary about
ghosts, that they aren't real.

01:22:52.072 --> 01:22:53.340
If ghosts were real,

01:22:53.373 --> 01:22:55.209
they wouldn't be scary at all,
right?

01:22:55.242 --> 01:22:58.680
We would just smile
and say, "Hi, ghosts."

01:22:58.713 --> 01:23:00.080
Hi, ghosts.

01:23:01.482 --> 01:23:03.283
Hi, ghost.

01:23:04.251 --> 01:23:06.353
Wouldn't that be cool?

01:23:06.386 --> 01:23:08.222
If when someone
wasn't there anymore,

01:23:08.255 --> 01:23:11.024
there was still
a little piece of them

01:23:11.058 --> 01:23:13.628
that could surprise you
sometimes?

01:23:13.661 --> 01:23:15.763
Yeah.

01:23:15.797 --> 01:23:18.766
But there's not,
there's nothing.

01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:21.134
And that's what's scary
about ghosts.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:25.507
That the little piece of someone

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:28.510
that feels like
it might still be there

01:23:28.543 --> 01:23:31.011
isn't there at all.

01:23:34.549 --> 01:23:36.250
Do you feel better?

01:23:36.283 --> 01:23:38.252
No.

01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:41.188
Me neither.

01:23:44.759 --> 01:23:46.561
Thanks for listening.

01:23:49.096 --> 01:23:52.032
I'm leaving tomorrow, Mason.

01:23:52.734 --> 01:23:54.569
I love you mucho.

01:23:54.602 --> 01:23:56.571
1-4-3-5.

01:23:56.604 --> 01:23:58.272
What?

01:23:58.305 --> 01:23:59.072
1-4-3-5.

01:23:59.106 --> 01:24:01.408
It's what Abby
used to say to me.

01:24:01.441 --> 01:24:04.612
She used to say,
"I love you mucho,"

01:24:04.646 --> 01:24:05.813
but then she shortened it.

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:08.081
So it was kind of like
a secret code

01:24:08.115 --> 01:24:09.283
'cause that's the number
of letters

01:24:09.316 --> 01:24:11.318
in "I love you mucho."

01:24:12.152 --> 01:24:14.656
1-4-3-5.

01:25:42.810 --> 01:25:45.245
Hello?

01:25:45.278 --> 01:25:46.714
This is beautiful.

01:25:46.748 --> 01:25:48.382
What is?

01:25:48.983 --> 01:25:50.551
What you just recorded.

01:25:50.585 --> 01:25:52.687
Your concluding piece.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:55.288
It's what we talked about
from the beginning.

01:25:55.322 --> 01:25:58.158
It's disconnection, myth...

01:25:58.893 --> 01:26:02.162
Uh, stories are always
personal, but...

01:26:03.564 --> 01:26:05.399
...this is you.

01:26:06.333 --> 01:26:08.402
You know, it's so you.

01:26:08.435 --> 01:26:11.405
It's kind of... everyone.

01:26:11.438 --> 01:26:13.407
You didn't lock that yet,
did you?

01:26:13.440 --> 01:26:14.942
No, not till the morning.

01:26:14.976 --> 01:26:16.577
It's on the server if you
want to check it out.

01:26:16.611 --> 01:26:18.680
Great, great. Uh, just-just
don't touch it tonight.

01:26:18.713 --> 01:26:21.314
There's, uh... It's not 100%.

01:26:21.348 --> 01:26:23.551
There's a tiny piece
I'm gonna add.

01:26:23.584 --> 01:26:26.253
No, don't touch it. It's great.

01:26:26.286 --> 01:26:27.755
You're only gonna
fuck it up. Don't.

01:26:29.924 --> 01:26:31.626
Where are you right now?

01:26:31.659 --> 01:26:33.661
Uh, I'm in an Uber.

01:26:34.461 --> 01:26:37.699
Well, anyway, good job.

01:26:37.732 --> 01:26:40.702
People are gonna love this.

01:26:40.735 --> 01:26:42.804
I didn't know you had it in you.

01:26:42.837 --> 01:26:44.839
Or maybe I did.

01:26:44.872 --> 01:26:46.941
Heart sees heart, right?

01:26:46.974 --> 01:26:48.609
Okay, all right.

01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:51.244
All right, just wait till
the morning, okay? Okay, bye.

Texas Tech fireworks, bitch.

Red and black, baby.

01:27:59.013 --> 01:28:00.648

01:28:00.681 --> 01:28:03.017
I told you black fireworks
ain't gonna show, you jackass.

01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:04.652
I can see 'em.

01:28:04.685 --> 01:28:05.820
Oh. Hey.

01:28:05.853 --> 01:28:07.922
It's the Longhorns fan.

01:28:07.955 --> 01:28:09.924
How's your car, man?

01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:11.526
You like what we did to it?

01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:13.561
That was about football?

01:28:13.594 --> 01:28:14.929
Jesus Christ.

01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:22.069
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:28:22.103 --> 01:28:23.938
I got an invite.

01:28:23.971 --> 01:28:25.338
-Oh, you're wearing my shit.
-Yeah.

01:28:25.372 --> 01:28:26.607
What the fuck?

01:28:26.641 --> 01:28:28.643
Okay, well, it's his hat, so...

01:28:30.745 --> 01:28:31.913
You better be careful.

01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:33.114
That's a loaded gun.

01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:34.582
You keep your gun loaded?

01:28:34.615 --> 01:28:36.483
You keep your phone charged?

01:28:36.517 --> 01:28:38.519
-How'd you even get here?
-Mason drove me.

01:28:38.553 --> 01:28:40.555
Who in the fuck is Mason?

01:28:40.588 --> 01:28:41.956
Mason's your fucking brother.

01:28:41.989 --> 01:28:43.925
I'd watch your back.

01:28:43.958 --> 01:28:45.660
You don't have friends here.

01:28:45.693 --> 01:28:47.695
Look who it is.

01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:50.097
Look who it is.

01:28:50.131 --> 01:28:51.999
-My friend.
-Look at you, bud.

01:28:52.033 --> 01:28:53.901
How you doing?

01:28:53.935 --> 01:28:55.837
How's that podcast coming?

01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:57.738
I sent it in last night.

01:28:59.073 --> 01:29:00.708
You're still here?

01:29:00.741 --> 01:29:02.710
Still here.

01:29:05.478 --> 01:29:07.949
Texas has a pull, doesn't it?

01:29:08.983 --> 01:29:10.651
Kinda gets under your skin.

01:29:10.685 --> 01:29:12.520
Hundred percent.

01:29:12.553 --> 01:29:15.089
Why don't you turn
that thing on?

01:29:15.122 --> 01:29:16.924
Got a story for you.

01:29:16.958 --> 01:29:18.926
Fellas.

01:29:23.731 --> 01:29:29.103
First drug law in the
United States passed in 1875.

01:29:29.136 --> 01:29:30.504
The Chinese rail workers

01:29:30.538 --> 01:29:32.472
-brought in the opium den.
-Mm.

01:29:32.506 --> 01:29:36.476
And this country
was so anti-immigrant

01:29:36.510 --> 01:29:39.747
that they banned the opium den.

01:29:40.548 --> 01:29:42.083
-Not the opium.
-Hmm.

01:29:42.116 --> 01:29:43.618
Right?

01:29:43.651 --> 01:29:45.620
You ever hear anything
more American than that?

01:29:45.653 --> 01:29:47.622
I mean, now we got
an opium epidemic

01:29:47.655 --> 01:29:49.557
breaking out across
the heartland

01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:52.894
with all the ceremony,
majesty, glamour

01:29:52.927 --> 01:29:54.095
and fun's removed.

01:29:54.128 --> 01:29:56.429
And-and that's what
people yearn for.

01:29:56.463 --> 01:29:58.766
You see what I'm saying?

01:29:59.901 --> 01:30:02.937
Do you think Gary Webb
would've won a Pulitzer today?

01:30:04.538 --> 01:30:07.508
You know, I think you were
smart for staying here.

01:30:07.541 --> 01:30:09.677
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:30:09.710 --> 01:30:14.081
That story about Abilene,
it's nice.

01:30:15.049 --> 01:30:18.451
I think you were meant
to tell a bigger story.

01:30:18.485 --> 01:30:21.656
Ask yourself,
what part of the country today

01:30:21.689 --> 01:30:24.191
is it in certain
people's interest

01:30:24.225 --> 01:30:26.928
to keep devastated, demoralized,

01:30:26.961 --> 01:30:29.664
dependent and divided?

01:30:29.697 --> 01:30:31.498
You got the opioid crisis,

01:30:31.532 --> 01:30:33.901
nation in divide, civic unrest.

01:30:33.935 --> 01:30:37.505
Why are all these things
happening at the same time?

01:30:37.538 --> 01:30:39.807
What do you really think
is going on here?

01:30:43.678 --> 01:30:46.479
Told you I had a story for you.

01:30:55.623 --> 01:30:57.091
So what are you saying?

01:30:57.124 --> 01:30:58.526
That it all connects?

01:30:58.559 --> 01:31:01.662
That the conspiracy theories
are true?

01:31:01.696 --> 01:31:03.564
What I'm saying is

01:31:03.597 --> 01:31:07.101
people can sense the truth,

01:31:07.134 --> 01:31:09.704
but they're grasping
for the facts.

01:31:09.737 --> 01:31:13.607
See, a myth is just
a truth without facts.

01:31:13.641 --> 01:31:15.977
That's why it comes out
all abstract, gnarled,

01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:17.745
wrong.

01:31:18.546 --> 01:31:19.880
Easy to dismiss and ridicule.

01:31:19.914 --> 01:31:22.149
Nobody listens to them

01:31:22.183 --> 01:31:24.852
because they don't have
the facts.

01:31:26.554 --> 01:31:28.155
But I do.

01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:29.256
And you, Ben...

01:31:29.290 --> 01:31:30.958
Yeah.

01:31:32.626 --> 01:31:35.096
...the whole damn
world will listen to you.

01:31:42.303 --> 01:31:44.005
Where are they going?

01:31:44.038 --> 01:31:45.873
Afterparty.

01:31:47.308 --> 01:31:48.876
The Afterparty.

01:31:48.909 --> 01:31:50.711
Tell me about that.

01:31:50.745 --> 01:31:54.015
I mean, people overdose
a hundred times a day, Ben.

01:31:54.048 --> 01:31:55.649
That's a fact.

01:31:55.683 --> 01:31:57.018
But they can't do it in
a place where it's gonna be

01:31:57.051 --> 01:31:59.653
a problem for people
like you and I. Hmm?

01:32:01.055 --> 01:32:03.057
That's what happened to Abilene.

01:32:04.792 --> 01:32:06.327
Abilene?

01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:10.031
I mean, she died
at a party like this.

01:32:11.799 --> 01:32:13.667
I thought you finished
that story.

01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:15.569
Oh.

01:32:15.603 --> 01:32:17.738
This is just for us.

01:32:17.772 --> 01:32:20.341
Well, it's not a very good
story anyway.

01:32:20.374 --> 01:32:22.576
Oh, she was a drug addict.

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:24.211
She OD'd.

01:32:24.245 --> 01:32:26.947
Then she tried to call 911.

01:32:27.815 --> 01:32:30.951
Oh. In Texas, we don't call 911.

01:32:30.985 --> 01:32:32.953
Yeah, I've heard that.

01:32:33.821 --> 01:32:35.956
They record all those calls.

01:32:35.990 --> 01:32:39.126
We gotta be very careful
about what gets recorded.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.062
Yeah. You do.

01:32:41.095 --> 01:32:44.031
It's all that's left of us.

01:32:44.065 --> 01:32:45.666
The recordings.

01:32:46.367 --> 01:32:49.670
And people like you
and I, Abilene,

01:32:49.703 --> 01:32:54.175
everybody posting photos
of every part of their day,

01:32:54.208 --> 01:32:58.012
we trade in our entire lives

01:32:58.045 --> 01:33:02.016
for the tiny pieces
that get recorded of us.

01:33:04.318 --> 01:33:05.820
Abilene tried to call 911.

01:33:05.853 --> 01:33:07.688
You didn't let her. Then what?

01:33:10.424 --> 01:33:11.826
Oh, boy.

01:33:11.859 --> 01:33:13.894
Don't get distracted.

01:33:13.928 --> 01:33:16.230
You gotta admit,
that's a hell of a distraction.

01:33:16.263 --> 01:33:18.999
That is... That's kind of like

01:33:19.033 --> 01:33:20.701
the very definition
of distraction.

01:33:20.734 --> 01:33:23.270
-Abilene.
-♪ Abilene. ♪

01:33:23.304 --> 01:33:26.240
-Abilene.
-♪ Abilene. ♪

01:33:26.273 --> 01:33:28.075
What happened to Abilene?

01:33:28.876 --> 01:33:30.911
Do you believe in ghosts, Ben?

01:33:30.945 --> 01:33:33.981
I got a call
from a ghost earlier.

01:33:35.349 --> 01:33:38.219
Kind of thought
I'd be seeing you today.

01:33:40.688 --> 01:33:42.389
What happened to her?

01:33:42.423 --> 01:33:44.625
Why do you care so much?

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.063
Why do you care so little?

01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:54.268
She overdosed.

01:33:54.301 --> 01:33:55.736
Instead of helping her,

01:33:55.769 --> 01:33:58.405
you dragged her
to the Afterparty,

01:33:58.439 --> 01:33:59.807
which is a spot
with no cell reception

01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.008
at the exact intersection

01:34:01.041 --> 01:34:04.044
of four overlapping
law jurisdictions

01:34:04.078 --> 01:34:05.412
where you knew her death

01:34:05.446 --> 01:34:09.150
would just become
an anonymous statistic.

01:34:09.183 --> 01:34:11.819
Hmm.

01:34:16.323 --> 01:34:18.159
It's well said.

01:34:18.192 --> 01:34:19.660
Very succinct.

01:34:22.930 --> 01:34:26.100
Yes. That's exactly
what happened.

01:34:33.407 --> 01:34:36.177
Brilliant.

01:34:36.210 --> 01:34:38.112
You got it.

01:34:38.145 --> 01:34:39.747
You got it all.

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:43.117
That's a story about America.

01:34:43.150 --> 01:34:45.920
Let me know if you need me
to rerecord anything.

01:34:45.953 --> 01:34:47.788
Or, like, rephrase things.

01:34:47.821 --> 01:34:49.924
I can do that, too.

01:34:50.925 --> 01:34:51.992
What?

01:34:52.026 --> 01:34:53.227
Oh, come...

01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.929
You and I are gonna
be sitting on a panel

01:34:54.962 --> 01:34:56.430
talking about this.
I want it to be great.

01:34:56.463 --> 01:34:59.133
We both know
how this works. Right?

01:34:59.166 --> 01:35:00.467
Yeah, I-I mean, at first,

01:35:00.502 --> 01:35:05.239
everyone's gonna think
you got your bad guy.

01:35:07.074 --> 01:35:09.410
Nobody's gonna let it be
that simple.

01:35:09.443 --> 01:35:10.878
Everyone's gonna have
to have their take

01:35:10.911 --> 01:35:13.814
'cause that's how it works now.

01:35:13.847 --> 01:35:16.016
Everyone has a take.

01:35:16.050 --> 01:35:17.918
See, if you don't have a take,
you don't have a voice.

01:35:17.952 --> 01:35:19.887
If you don't have a voice,
you don't exist.

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:25.025
So yeah, at first,
everyone's gonna blame me.

01:35:25.059 --> 01:35:29.096
But then someone's gonna say,
"Wait a second."

01:35:29.129 --> 01:35:33.767
There's a big difference
between leaving somebody to die

01:35:33.801 --> 01:35:36.136
and killing somebody.

01:35:37.838 --> 01:35:39.773
Then they're gonna turn to you.

01:35:40.575 --> 01:35:43.844
What were you doing here
in the first place?

01:35:43.877 --> 01:35:46.013
What was your relationship
with her?

01:35:46.046 --> 01:35:50.451
Why would you exploit
her grieving family?

01:35:50.484 --> 01:35:52.253
Those...

01:35:52.286 --> 01:35:53.954
Those characters.

01:35:53.988 --> 01:35:57.391
I mean... I mean,
that's what they're gonna be.

01:35:57.424 --> 01:35:59.493
Famous characters.

01:35:59.527 --> 01:36:01.161
Not famous people.

01:36:01.195 --> 01:36:03.797
And then they're gonna blame
the family.

01:36:03.831 --> 01:36:06.166
Oh, I hope they're ready
for that.

01:36:07.901 --> 01:36:09.537
They'll blame the president.

01:36:09.571 --> 01:36:11.573
The last president.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.109
And then they'll start in
with the conspiracy theories.

01:36:15.142 --> 01:36:17.545
You know, and someone will
refute the conspiracy theories,

01:36:17.579 --> 01:36:23.217
and then one side will make
their version like their cause.

01:36:23.250 --> 01:36:25.919
And the other side
will take the other side

01:36:25.953 --> 01:36:30.024
just to take the other side
and on, and on.

01:36:30.057 --> 01:36:33.561
Until your story proves

01:36:33.595 --> 01:36:37.298
the defining truth of our time.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.602
Which is what?

01:36:40.635 --> 01:36:45.607
Everything means everything.

01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:50.244
So nothing means anything.

01:36:53.981 --> 01:36:56.917
Some things mean something.

01:36:58.485 --> 01:37:00.054
Yeah?

01:37:00.087 --> 01:37:01.221
Like what?

01:37:02.222 --> 01:37:03.957
Abilene?

01:37:04.626 --> 01:37:06.460
You didn't care about her.

01:37:06.493 --> 01:37:09.129
You came here for yourself.

01:37:09.163 --> 01:37:11.999
For recording.

01:37:12.032 --> 01:37:14.935
And then you heard her music.

01:37:14.968 --> 01:37:16.236
And you saw her photos.

01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:19.006
The record of her.

01:37:19.641 --> 01:37:22.242
And that's what you care for.

01:37:23.243 --> 01:37:25.112
A recording.

01:37:26.246 --> 01:37:28.182
Not a person.

01:37:31.519 --> 01:37:34.388
We are all...

01:37:34.421 --> 01:37:37.458
just inspirations

01:37:37.491 --> 01:37:40.094
for the record of ourselves.

01:37:40.127 --> 01:37:41.629
You and I both know it.

01:37:41.663 --> 01:37:43.997
You got your opus.

01:37:44.031 --> 01:37:46.634
And that's what matters.

01:37:46.668 --> 01:37:48.469
But Abilene?

01:37:48.503 --> 01:37:50.371
The person?

01:37:51.639 --> 01:37:54.007
Come on.

01:37:54.041 --> 01:37:56.009
She was just some girl.

01:37:56.043 --> 01:37:58.613
That's the truth, Ben.

01:39:51.659 --> 01:39:53.427
Bullshit.

01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:54.562
People.

01:39:54.596 --> 01:39:55.730
Got a report.

01:39:55.763 --> 01:39:57.231

Yeah.

01:40:41.275 --> 01:40:45.112
And I understand that was
quite a party last night.

01:40:46.748 --> 01:40:49.082
I wasn't there.

01:40:49.717 --> 01:40:51.686
That's right, you weren't.

01:40:51.719 --> 01:40:53.320
But...

01:40:53.353 --> 01:40:56.423
I heard it was
a pretty good party.

01:40:59.627 --> 01:41:05.365
I've... very much enjoyed
being in your home.

01:41:08.536 --> 01:41:10.705
You're gonna need a ride.

01:41:10.738 --> 01:41:11.839
That's true.

01:41:11.873 --> 01:41:15.208
My car is, uh...

01:41:16.310 --> 01:41:19.146
What are your plans
when you get back?

01:41:19.179 --> 01:41:21.448
Guess I have to find
a new story.

01:41:21.481 --> 01:41:23.518
After all that?

01:41:23.551 --> 01:41:26.253
What about all that stuff
with Abby?

01:41:26.286 --> 01:41:29.524
I think that story's
just for us.

01:41:29.557 --> 01:41:31.526
Oh.

01:41:33.761 --> 01:41:36.564
That's nice, too.

01:41:36.598 --> 01:41:38.600
No regrets.

01:41:38.633 --> 01:41:39.901
I never understood that.

01:41:39.934 --> 01:41:41.468
No regrets.

01:41:41.502 --> 01:41:44.237
I mean, how do you...

01:41:45.907 --> 01:41:49.476
In my life, everything starts
with a regret,

01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:50.812
ends with a regret.

01:41:50.845 --> 01:41:53.581
In between, regrets.

01:41:53.615 --> 01:41:56.216
It's all regrets.

01:41:56.249 --> 01:41:58.385
You run as fast as you can
from the last regret

01:41:58.418 --> 01:41:59.854
and, of course,
you're just running

01:41:59.887 --> 01:42:01.789
<i>straight into the next one.</i>

01:42:01.823 --> 01:42:03.758
<i>That's life.</i>

01:42:03.791 --> 01:42:05.225
<i>It's all regrets.</i>

01:42:05.258 --> 01:42:07.662
<i>That's what they should say.</i>

01:42:07.695 --> 01:42:09.564
<i>No other way to be alive.</i>

01:42:10.865 --> 01:42:13.200
<i>It's all regrets.</i>

01:42:14.234 --> 01:42:16.169
<i>Make 'em count.</i>
