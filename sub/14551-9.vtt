00:12.945 --> 00:14.943
Previously on Powers...

00:14.945 --> 00:16.944
- Johnny.
- Wolfe, sir.

00:17.598 --> 00:20.597
You made a drug out of me, didn't you?

00:20.598 --> 00:22.597
I am void that must be filled.

00:22.598 --> 00:27.016
And you, you have given me
a chance to fill that void.

00:27.249 --> 00:30.705
You stupid fucking idiot.

00:30.706 --> 00:33.705
How many of them can I suck dry?

00:33.706 --> 00:34.706
What did he say to you?

00:36.706 --> 00:39.705
I need your help to kill Wolfe.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.916
Allow me to explain.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.458
You made this shit from Wolfe's blood?

00:43.583 --> 00:44.705
And you took that drug

00:44.706 --> 00:46.790
to try and get your powers back.

00:49.082 --> 00:50.225
I was there.

00:50.234 --> 00:51.233
I saw you.

00:51.234 --> 00:52.233
I have powers.

00:52.337 --> 00:53.421
What exactly do you have?

00:53.588 --> 00:55.336
You should be afraid of me.

00:55.337 --> 00:57.618
Who's the one witness we have
never been able to question?

00:58.338 --> 00:59.463
Can I interrupt?

00:59.588 --> 01:01.336
The kid with her.

01:01.337 --> 01:03.336
Krispin, it's my old partner's kid.

01:03.337 --> 01:04.336
They ran the GPS on his phone.

01:04.337 --> 01:05.504
He's at the Temple Theater.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.336
This is the Powers' world.

01:07.337 --> 01:09.336
And 100% fake.

01:09.337 --> 01:11.337
Zora!

01:15.380 --> 01:17.336
No, can somebody help?

01:17.337 --> 01:18.337
Shit...

01:25.337 --> 01:27.336
Like old times.

01:27.337 --> 01:28.337
You can count on it.

01:40.172 --> 01:41.337
Jesus.

01:46.337 --> 01:47.380
We can do it.

01:47.547 --> 01:49.337
You take your powers back.

01:50.337 --> 01:51.337
You kill him.

01:52.337 --> 01:53.964
And I'll get us out.

01:57.337 --> 01:59.337
Whenever I try to trace it back,

02:00.337 --> 02:03.297
work out who's to blame for what,

02:03.337 --> 02:05.463
who owns which dead bodies,

02:05.588 --> 02:09.336
I've never been able to get past
blaming myself for all of it.

02:12.337 --> 02:15.336
Which is just ego, you know?

02:15.337 --> 02:20.337
It's like, I'm responsible
for the weight of the world.

02:23.337 --> 02:24.839
Now, I...

02:24.964 --> 02:26.337
I can see now,

02:27.337 --> 02:29.336
whoever's to blame for not killing him,

02:29.337 --> 02:32.005
it's beside the point.

02:32.130 --> 02:35.463
All the dead bodies belong to Wolfe.

02:39.172 --> 02:40.337
So...

02:44.337 --> 02:49.336
I'm going to help Johnny Royalle,

02:49.337 --> 02:54.337
break into the Shaft and
kill Wolfe, once and for all.

02:58.337 --> 03:00.256
Why are you telling me this?

03:01.713 --> 03:03.336
Because I need your help.

03:03.567 --> 03:05.566
You don't even know what you're doing.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.693
I do. I have a plan.

03:07.818 --> 03:10.110
You've given me no choice, Walker.

03:10.235 --> 03:11.566
I need your help.

03:11.567 --> 03:13.566
You have invited me to join a conspiracy

03:13.567 --> 03:14.860
to commit first degree murder!

03:14.985 --> 03:17.985
I have to report this. I
should be arresting you.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.567
Royalle did it first.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.566
What?

03:25.567 --> 03:30.567
Royalle invited me to join a
conspiracy to commit murder.

03:33.319 --> 03:35.567
- We got him. Yeah.
- Jesus, shit, we got him.

03:36.567 --> 03:37.566
You got him.

03:37.567 --> 03:39.486
You got his ass, Walker.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.567
We got him. We got him.

03:47.567 --> 03:49.985
Now...

03:50.110 --> 03:52.566
We just have to help
him break into the Shaft

03:52.567 --> 03:54.567
to make it stick.

04:41.567 --> 04:43.360
You still have a way with an entrance.

04:43.486 --> 04:45.651
Says the man who rose from the dead.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.566
I'm going to have to...

04:50.567 --> 04:52.566
Oh Johnny, where's the trust?

04:52.567 --> 04:54.235
In the past.

04:56.567 --> 05:00.567
If you are wearing a
wire, it's now useless.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.566
Can we get down to business now?

05:03.567 --> 05:06.610
My sense of urgency is no less than yours.

05:06.735 --> 05:09.566
I'm trying to save the
lives of over 100 innocents.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.194
Yeah, none of whom would be in any danger

05:11.319 --> 05:12.639
if you hadn't given them all Sway.

05:13.567 --> 05:15.777
Are we going to keep wasting time

05:15.943 --> 05:19.360
pointing the finger of
blame at one another?

05:21.567 --> 05:23.566
Look, Johnny,

05:23.567 --> 05:25.566
I want to save Calista and
these kids as much as you.

05:25.567 --> 05:27.566
I'm tired of being a cop.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.566
Ineffectual.

05:29.567 --> 05:32.567
I want to be able to help people again.

05:39.610 --> 05:42.566
There are things I'm going to need.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.444
Like what?

05:44.902 --> 05:47.566
If I keep popping around that place,

05:47.567 --> 05:50.566
it's like I'm signing the crime.

05:50.567 --> 05:53.566
With circumstantial evidence.

05:53.567 --> 05:56.566
I want to be invisible.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.567
You need to get new powers.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.567
Can you handle it or not?

06:05.567 --> 06:08.566
Okay, what else?

06:08.567 --> 06:10.444
I'm going to need blueprints.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.567
Complete and up to date.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.567
You've been teleporting
into his cell for months.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.567
I need the plans.

06:24.567 --> 06:26.566
Have you recorded any of your meetings?

06:26.567 --> 06:30.566
No, he always teleports
me to fry any electronics.

06:30.567 --> 06:32.566
I could shield the recorder
against that effect.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.566
The recording isn't enough.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.566
We need to catch him in the act.

06:35.567 --> 06:36.566
No, if we catch him on tape...

06:36.567 --> 06:38.985
No, Walker's right.
Evidence isn't the issue.

06:39.384 --> 06:40.798
Custody is the issue.

06:40.799 --> 06:42.039
How do you arrest a teleporter?

06:42.092 --> 06:43.798
You have to disable him like that.

06:43.799 --> 06:44.799
Or he...

06:45.799 --> 06:46.799
Drainer.

06:47.799 --> 06:50.798
Yes, it's the only way to be sure.

06:50.799 --> 06:53.799
Will that thing be ready? Can
you shoot him with it and...

06:54.799 --> 06:56.798
It's single use.

06:56.799 --> 06:59.798
If the timing isn't
perfect, if he saw me...

06:59.799 --> 07:01.175
It isn't even finished yet.

07:01.301 --> 07:02.798
You need a drainer trap.

07:02.799 --> 07:06.798
He can get caught in one
step and zap, it's on.

07:06.799 --> 07:09.798
The Drainer pod is self-contained,
for transporting prisoners.

07:09.799 --> 07:11.798
It won't project a beam
unless I overload it.

07:11.799 --> 07:12.798
What will that do?

07:12.799 --> 07:15.798
Probably kill any Power caught in it.

07:15.799 --> 07:17.798
Drain them forever, at the least.

07:17.799 --> 07:19.799
We have a Drainer trap

07:20.799 --> 07:23.799
that Royalle is planning
to walk right into.

07:24.799 --> 07:25.798
- Wolfe's cell.
- No.

07:25.799 --> 07:27.718
- No, Christian. No.
- Harley...

07:27.799 --> 07:29.426
We have to find another way, Christian.

07:29.592 --> 07:32.301
Harley. They need to understand why.

07:39.799 --> 07:41.798
I'm sorry about this.

07:41.799 --> 07:44.799
But the world as you know
it is going to end soon.

07:57.799 --> 08:00.798
- Fuck.
- We should have practiced more.

08:00.799 --> 08:02.883
I'm good. I'll be fine.

08:03.009 --> 08:04.798
Come on, this way.

08:04.799 --> 08:06.799
No, no, it's this way.

08:06.883 --> 08:10.799
Are you questioning my sense of direction?

08:12.799 --> 08:15.925
Or is that where your friends
have set the trap for me?

08:16.092 --> 08:17.798
There is no trap.

08:17.799 --> 08:19.799
And it's this way.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.134
The system upgrade should be
completed about the same time

08:30.259 --> 08:32.798
we finish repairs on level eight and nine.

08:32.799 --> 08:35.798
Do you still have blind spots
down there from Wolfe's escape?

08:35.799 --> 08:36.799
We do.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.798
That sounds dangerous.

08:38.799 --> 08:41.799
It could be if anybody knew about them.

08:46.799 --> 08:48.798
Okay.

08:48.799 --> 08:50.799
So this is the end of the blind zone.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.799
Where's the panel?

08:56.799 --> 08:57.967
Shit.

08:59.799 --> 09:03.551
Show Commander Cross and Detective
Pilgrim how the repairs are going.

09:07.799 --> 09:09.798
What now?

09:09.799 --> 09:12.799
Well, if I go, I'm busted.

09:13.883 --> 09:16.050
So, you can just...

09:16.175 --> 09:18.798
My teleportation powers
will blind the cameras.

09:18.799 --> 09:19.800
How convenient.

09:19.925 --> 09:20.925
What?

09:21.799 --> 09:24.799
Give me the widget.

09:26.384 --> 09:28.798
Teleportation is instantaneous, Christian.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.798
I know, so hurry up already.

09:30.799 --> 09:34.798
If this is a trap, it better
be a very fast one indeed,

09:34.799 --> 09:37.799
to keep me from popping back
here and taking your head off.

09:38.799 --> 09:40.551
Like Bug?

09:40.718 --> 09:41.799
I never said that.

09:44.115 --> 09:45.904
Level nine is still a mess.

09:45.905 --> 09:48.154
But repairs on eight have reached
segment four in the outer ring.

09:48.165 --> 09:50.698
- Segment four?
- Yes, sir.

09:50.865 --> 09:52.323
The crew was able to move
ahead of schedule today.

09:52.448 --> 09:53.905
Details on your desktop.

09:56.905 --> 09:58.905
Okay. You ready?

10:01.905 --> 10:02.905
Go.

10:03.905 --> 10:05.904
That looks like a teleport pulse.

10:05.905 --> 10:06.905
I see it.

10:07.905 --> 10:09.657
Is Wolfe secure?

10:09.782 --> 10:10.905
Wolfe's cell, now.

10:17.824 --> 10:19.905
Okay. Show me segment four again.

10:22.905 --> 10:23.905
Done.

10:38.615 --> 10:39.905
Cycle all cameras, all levels.

10:43.905 --> 10:46.240
When I say the Black Swan
can destroy the world,

10:46.407 --> 10:47.904
I'm not being metaphorical.

10:47.905 --> 10:49.904
It's only a matter of time,

10:49.905 --> 10:51.407
and very little time,

10:51.623 --> 10:53.995
before a Power of that scale manifests.

10:53.996 --> 10:54.995
It may already be here.

10:54.996 --> 10:56.122
Like Wolfe?

10:56.247 --> 10:57.995
He's the frontrunner.

10:57.996 --> 10:59.995
I will not let Royalle near him.

10:59.996 --> 11:01.995
It's too dangerous.

11:01.996 --> 11:02.996
Really?

11:06.289 --> 11:07.996
You know what Sway is?

11:09.996 --> 11:10.996
It's Wolfe.

11:11.996 --> 11:14.995
That's what he was doing here.

11:14.996 --> 11:18.331
He was taking Wolfe's blood
and turning his DNA into a drug,

11:18.456 --> 11:19.996
and giving it to Kidz.

11:26.996 --> 11:28.995
How would we start?

11:29.109 --> 11:31.777
I need to make him think
that he can trust me.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.108
How?

11:33.109 --> 11:35.108
I promised him that I could
get blueprints to this place.

11:35.109 --> 11:37.108
Holy Christ. Why didn't
you just promise my leg?

11:37.109 --> 11:38.527
He didn't ask for it.

11:38.652 --> 11:40.109
Guys, come on, come on.

11:44.109 --> 11:46.108
It could work.

11:46.109 --> 11:50.108
Yes. Just... Deena. Just the four of us.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.109
Too many possible leaks
if your whole staff knows.

11:54.109 --> 11:59.360
I wouldn't want anyone implicated
in something so extra-legal.

11:59.485 --> 12:02.109
Okay. Well, look at this.

12:05.109 --> 12:09.108
These are the three
unrepaired blind segments.

12:09.109 --> 12:10.110
And this is Wolfe's cell.

12:14.109 --> 12:18.109
So these segments won't be fully
repaired for at least a week.

12:20.109 --> 12:23.108
So we teleport into the blind segments.

12:23.109 --> 12:26.108
Then what? How do we move around?

12:26.109 --> 12:28.193
All the levels are almost identical.

12:28.319 --> 12:33.611
So we patch this into
the surveillance system.

12:33.777 --> 12:36.108
It'll hack into the cameras,

12:36.109 --> 12:38.108
and then the screens that
are supposed to be showing

12:38.109 --> 12:42.108
levels eight and nine will
actually be showing level seven.

12:42.109 --> 12:44.108
No.

12:44.109 --> 12:46.108
My teleport pulse will fry it.

12:46.109 --> 12:49.108
No, because Triphammer

12:49.109 --> 12:51.108
shielded this against that.

12:51.109 --> 12:52.108
What?

12:52.109 --> 12:55.108
I told him it was for you, Johnny.

12:55.109 --> 13:00.444
I had to. I told him,
Cross and my partner that

13:00.611 --> 13:04.108
I'm helping you break into
the Shaft to kill Wolfe.

13:04.109 --> 13:05.902
I had to. Okay?

13:06.028 --> 13:08.108
We can't do this without their help.

13:08.109 --> 13:10.108
And they'll only help me if they think

13:10.109 --> 13:13.108
this is all an elaborate plan to catch you.

13:13.109 --> 13:15.819
But of course, it's not.

13:15.944 --> 13:20.109
Johnny, do you ever wonder
what the world would be like

13:21.944 --> 13:23.109
if it hadn't all gone wrong?

13:24.109 --> 13:26.109
If we had killed him back then, man,

13:29.109 --> 13:33.109
if I hadn't lost my powers, you think
the world would be a better place?

13:34.109 --> 13:35.444
I say it would be.

13:38.109 --> 13:42.109
Your ego, Christian, is dumbfounding.

13:47.109 --> 13:49.108
Tell me what else your compatriots

13:49.109 --> 13:51.109
are going to do to ease our passage.

13:54.109 --> 13:56.108
My uncle got me this job.

13:56.109 --> 13:58.109
Family is a wonderful thing.

13:58.152 --> 14:01.108
Wolfe killed him when he got loose.

14:01.109 --> 14:02.108
Asshole storage.

14:02.109 --> 14:04.109
If you're ever looking for a place to stay.

14:05.109 --> 14:06.319
Five minutes.

14:06.444 --> 14:08.444
I'll give you some privacy.

14:16.360 --> 14:18.109
Simons.

14:23.109 --> 14:24.189
Why haven't you got me out?

14:25.109 --> 14:26.277
I can't.

14:26.402 --> 14:29.108
I'm stuck inside myself.

14:29.109 --> 14:30.819
I can't get out. The walls are too close.

14:32.109 --> 14:36.109
Simons, I need someone I can trust.

14:37.109 --> 14:38.444
You could always trust me.

14:38.569 --> 14:40.193
I know.

14:40.319 --> 14:43.109
That's why I need you to stay in here.

14:43.611 --> 14:45.109
What?

14:53.360 --> 14:55.108
It's the way it's got to be.

14:55.109 --> 14:56.109
It's gold-plated bullshit.

14:58.109 --> 15:00.109
It's in order.

15:06.109 --> 15:09.108
How much longer is my
client expected to wait?

15:09.214 --> 15:10.214
Detective.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.298
Deena.

15:21.465 --> 15:24.213
I'd appreciate it, Detective Pilgrim,

15:24.214 --> 15:27.049
if you'd stop breaking into my club

15:27.174 --> 15:30.213
- and harassing young innocents like Ms. Secor.
- Okay.

15:30.214 --> 15:32.213
Saucer eyes here has been
everywhere she shouldn't be

15:32.214 --> 15:34.213
since the day I got here.

15:34.214 --> 15:36.799
Dead body? There she is.

15:36.924 --> 15:39.966
Powers gangster comes back
from the dead. There she is.

15:40.091 --> 15:42.257
Power gets her throat
slit. There she fucking is.

15:42.424 --> 15:47.213
And yet, other than a trumped
up threat to use Powers,

15:47.214 --> 15:50.214
you've failed to charge her with anything.

15:53.214 --> 15:54.214
I can't do this.

16:23.214 --> 16:25.716
Well, that went perfectly.
What the hell was that?

16:25.841 --> 16:27.213
I was playing my part.

16:27.214 --> 16:29.213
Your part was to let Calista out.

16:29.214 --> 16:31.213
No.

16:31.214 --> 16:34.214
My part is to play the detective
that thinks this is bullshit.

16:36.214 --> 16:39.213
This is how we get Royalle.
This is what we agreed.

16:39.214 --> 16:41.213
So the kid gets out because he wants it?

16:41.214 --> 16:42.213
Yeah.

16:42.214 --> 16:44.213
- Well, what else does he get?
- I don't know.

16:44.214 --> 16:47.091
When does all the shit that
he wants get to be too much?

16:47.214 --> 16:49.214
Deena, it's worth it to bust him.

16:50.214 --> 16:53.213
It's getting more fucked up by the minute.

16:53.214 --> 16:55.414
I don't know who it is I'm
supposed to be trusting here.

16:57.214 --> 16:58.214
We're partners.

16:59.882 --> 17:01.482
We're supposed to be trusting each other.

17:02.214 --> 17:04.589
Or so you keep telling me.

17:06.214 --> 17:08.632
Death is always senseless.

17:08.757 --> 17:11.049
There is no meaning in the end of life.

17:12.214 --> 17:16.674
Meaning, comfort comes from
beyond death's threshold.

17:16.799 --> 17:19.213
And it is this blankness,

17:19.214 --> 17:23.213
this vast impossibility of understanding,

17:23.214 --> 17:27.213
that causes so much confusion and grief

17:27.214 --> 17:29.213
in those of us who are left behind.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.590
This is your fault.

17:32.214 --> 17:35.716
If you did your job, she'd still be alive.

17:42.340 --> 17:45.213
This was a bad idea.

17:45.214 --> 17:46.213
You wanted to come.

17:46.214 --> 17:47.213
If you want to leave...

17:47.214 --> 17:48.799
- Hey, Krisp.
- No.

17:48.924 --> 17:51.213
- Krispin.
- I want to try and talk to him.

17:51.214 --> 17:53.214
What was that about, man?

17:57.214 --> 17:58.214
You know...

17:59.214 --> 18:01.213
We put Red Hawk down the Shaft.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.214
He's never gonna see daylight again.

18:04.298 --> 18:06.214
- And the others?
- The others?

18:06.298 --> 18:09.213
Zora and Retro Girl.

18:09.214 --> 18:10.757
They should be in the
Shaft right next to him.

18:10.882 --> 18:14.049
- Krispin...
- It was a publicity stunt.

18:14.174 --> 18:15.213
It was a game.

18:15.214 --> 18:18.213
She died because they were fucking around.

18:18.214 --> 18:21.213
Look, there will be an investigation.

18:21.214 --> 18:24.091
No, three Powers killed my mom.

18:24.214 --> 18:26.213
The only difference between
them is that Zora and Retro Girl

18:26.214 --> 18:28.674
look a lot better on
camera than Red Hawk does.

18:28.799 --> 18:31.213
No, no. It's more complicated than that.

18:31.214 --> 18:33.213
The world is more complicated
than that, Krispin.

18:33.214 --> 18:34.214
Come on, you know that.

18:42.214 --> 18:43.214
Look, uh...

18:44.214 --> 18:46.214
We need to talk, man.

18:47.632 --> 18:52.213
This Kaotic Chic, whatever that is...

18:52.214 --> 18:54.214
It's not going away.

18:54.215 --> 18:57.257
You're implicated in a murder.

18:57.382 --> 18:59.213
I'm trying to make things better.

18:59.214 --> 19:01.213
- You want to make this better?
- Yeah.

19:01.214 --> 19:02.214
Well, you go into the Shaft,

19:02.257 --> 19:05.213
and you put a bullet in Red Hawk's eye.

19:05.214 --> 19:07.214
Then it will be better.

19:07.424 --> 19:08.424
Krispin?

19:16.214 --> 19:17.340
I'm sorry.

19:18.214 --> 19:20.213
I'm so sorry.

19:20.214 --> 19:23.214
I'm sorry, Krispin. I'm so sorry.

19:24.214 --> 19:27.214
You're not alone, okay? I'm here.

19:30.214 --> 19:31.214
Okay?

19:36.841 --> 19:38.213
What the fuck?

19:38.214 --> 19:40.213
You brought a fucking
Power to my mom's funeral?

19:40.214 --> 19:43.213
He's my friend. I didn't
want to come alone, so...

19:43.214 --> 19:44.413
Get the fuck away from me.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.465
- Krispin.
- Get the fuck away!

19:46.590 --> 19:47.590
Please...

19:52.882 --> 19:55.213
Jesus. What are you doing here?

19:55.214 --> 19:57.924
It was important to her.

19:59.214 --> 20:00.213
I didn't come here to piss you off.

20:00.214 --> 20:01.924
I want you to choose.

20:02.049 --> 20:04.213
What are we doing, Johnny?

20:04.214 --> 20:06.213
Saving her life.

20:06.214 --> 20:07.213
Protecting his.

20:07.214 --> 20:09.214
You need to calm down a little bit. No.

20:09.257 --> 20:11.214
Heroes at last.

20:12.214 --> 20:14.213
Does it always feel this good?

20:14.214 --> 20:15.966
There's no in-between.

20:17.424 --> 20:20.214
How would I know?

20:38.507 --> 20:40.214
Hey.

20:42.257 --> 20:44.213
May I?

20:44.214 --> 20:46.213
Yes, please, come in.

20:46.214 --> 20:48.214
- Come in. Welcome.
- Thank you.

20:51.214 --> 20:55.007
Not much redecorating in
the past eight years, I see.

20:55.133 --> 20:58.213
Yeah. Well, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.

20:58.214 --> 21:00.213
Right?

21:00.214 --> 21:02.214
Is that your new philosophy, is it?

21:05.214 --> 21:07.213
It could be.

21:07.214 --> 21:11.214
It's just I have a talent
for breaking shit, so...

21:12.214 --> 21:14.214
You're not the only one. Obviously.

21:14.257 --> 21:16.213
I went to the funeral.

21:16.214 --> 21:18.213
How's her son?

21:18.214 --> 21:19.214
Shattered.

21:20.716 --> 21:22.966
You're not...

21:23.133 --> 21:25.213
The reason she died, okay?

21:25.214 --> 21:27.213
As soon as I discovered
what they were doing,

21:27.214 --> 21:29.213
I should have shut them down.

21:29.214 --> 21:30.213
There was no reason to think that

21:30.214 --> 21:33.174
it would all go sideways, Janice.

21:33.214 --> 21:37.213
It wouldn't have if Red
Hawk hadn't been on Sway.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.632
If you want someone to
blame, we know who it is.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.213
You did your job.

21:45.214 --> 21:48.213
You saved Red Hawk,

21:48.214 --> 21:53.214
and you kept Zora from ruining her life.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.214
Why didn't you call?

21:58.716 --> 22:02.213
It's only been a couple days.

22:02.214 --> 22:04.590
It was eight years, Christian.

22:07.214 --> 22:11.213
You lost your powers and you hid from me.

22:11.214 --> 22:13.214
Jesus, Janice.

22:15.214 --> 22:17.214
No small talk.

22:21.353 --> 22:22.811
What was I going to say?

22:24.769 --> 22:27.768
What did we have to talk about?

22:27.769 --> 22:30.768
Once I lost my powers, what
did we have to talk about?

22:30.769 --> 22:32.767
Everything.

22:32.768 --> 22:34.768
Like we always did.

22:42.769 --> 22:46.768
I didn't want you to see me like this.

22:46.769 --> 22:50.769
Okay? I didn't want to be this with you.

22:53.769 --> 22:56.769
I didn't want you because you had powers.

22:57.769 --> 23:00.769
I just wanted you.

23:06.769 --> 23:11.768
I've been playing you guys for
a chance to get my powers back.

23:11.769 --> 23:12.768
- Fucking knew it.
- I fucking knew it.

23:12.769 --> 23:13.768
You never change.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.768
Well, hear me out. Hear me out, okay?

23:16.769 --> 23:18.768
I caught Wolfe.

23:18.769 --> 23:19.769
What?

23:20.770 --> 23:24.768
I caught him. Not Zora, not Retro Girl.

23:24.769 --> 23:25.768
Christian, I was there.

23:25.769 --> 23:28.768
Listen to me. I took Sway.

23:28.769 --> 23:30.768
And somehow, I don't know how,

23:30.769 --> 23:33.229
it strengthened my connection to Wolfe.

23:33.396 --> 23:36.768
And I got my powers back
long enough to lock him up.

23:36.769 --> 23:38.979
What, you got your powers
back? Do you have them?

23:39.769 --> 23:41.437
I don't have them now.

23:41.562 --> 23:44.769
They got sucked back
when the drainer came on.

23:45.769 --> 23:47.769
Anyway, the point is...

23:49.187 --> 23:50.769
Royalle knows.

23:51.769 --> 23:56.768
I told him that I'm playing you guys.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.768
Which is the only reason why he trusts me.

23:58.769 --> 23:59.768
How do we even keep it straight?

23:59.769 --> 24:02.768
Why don't you tell me
why we ought to trust you?

24:02.769 --> 24:04.229
Everyone who took Sway is at risk.

24:04.396 --> 24:06.768
If Wolfe gets out, he will drain them all,

24:06.769 --> 24:09.768
and kill them, no matter where they are.

24:09.769 --> 24:14.768
We need to bust Royalle
before he fucks this up again.

24:14.769 --> 24:17.562
Before or after he kills Wolfe?

24:18.769 --> 24:21.312
Now, listen, Christian just described

24:21.437 --> 24:23.768
the perfect Black Swan scenario.

24:23.769 --> 24:25.770
Now, are we just supposed to ignore that?

24:25.895 --> 24:29.770
No. If we let Royalle kill Wolfe,

24:29.937 --> 24:32.768
then we remove two threats at once.

24:32.769 --> 24:33.768
That's fucking murder.

24:33.769 --> 24:35.768
- It's murder.
- Yes. Technically, technically.

24:35.769 --> 24:38.768
We need to drain Wolfe.

24:38.769 --> 24:41.768
We need the effective and
permanent threat of the drainer,

24:41.769 --> 24:43.768
to quell disruptive Powers.

24:43.769 --> 24:46.768
We bust Royalle and drain Wolfe.

24:46.769 --> 24:48.768
That is the plan.

24:48.769 --> 24:50.768
The only plan.

24:50.769 --> 24:52.768
He's right. Royalle murdering Wolfe

24:52.769 --> 24:55.768
is another signal that
we're not in control.

24:55.769 --> 24:58.768
We're not in control.

24:58.769 --> 25:00.769
Wait, I have a question.

25:01.769 --> 25:03.769
What about your powers?

25:07.769 --> 25:09.768
I have to let them go. Bullshit.

25:09.769 --> 25:11.769
It's too risky to go for them.

25:12.769 --> 25:14.769
I only had them temporarily.

25:15.769 --> 25:17.769
I'm a cop now.

25:19.769 --> 25:22.145
Doing cop shit, and I want to bust Royalle

25:22.271 --> 25:24.769
before anybody else dies.

25:25.769 --> 25:27.768
I don't know, man.

25:27.769 --> 25:29.187
- Come on.
- Thank you.

25:30.770 --> 25:34.770
The plan will work. You
just have to trust me.

25:34.937 --> 25:40.768
Uh, this back room shit, it
sickens me on a cellular level.

25:40.769 --> 25:43.768
Look, we tried it your way. It didn't work.

25:43.769 --> 25:46.768
If we want him, he has to
think that he's one step ahead.

25:46.769 --> 25:49.688
We can't play by the rules.

25:49.769 --> 25:51.768
The only difference between
us and the Powers is that

25:51.769 --> 25:53.768
we have to play by the rules.

25:53.769 --> 25:57.768
And this plan breaks so many of
them, no one can know about it?

25:57.769 --> 26:01.768
That speaks volumes so
loud, I'm fucking deaf.

26:01.769 --> 26:03.768
So then what are you even doing here?

26:03.769 --> 26:06.768
Because I don't believe
you pretend to do good

26:06.769 --> 26:09.354
so you can get away with
fucked up shit, Walker.

26:09.479 --> 26:10.959
You want to do the right thing so bad,

26:11.062 --> 26:13.769
you don't know how to stop
from jumping off a building.

26:16.229 --> 26:18.104
And I'm your partner.

26:18.334 --> 26:20.874
If I don't have your back, no one does.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.874
Thank you.

26:24.874 --> 26:26.874
I won't let you down.

26:29.874 --> 26:32.873
You wanted to be
invisible, you're invisible.

26:32.874 --> 26:34.874
From the cameras anyway.

26:35.874 --> 26:37.873
Just don't let anyone see you.

26:37.874 --> 26:41.042
Yeah, invaluable advice indeed.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.873
Excuse me a moment.

26:42.874 --> 26:43.874
No.

26:44.874 --> 26:47.459
What the fuck?

28:02.874 --> 28:03.873
Mayhem?

28:03.874 --> 28:04.958
As much as you can cause.

28:05.874 --> 28:07.873
Simons.

28:07.874 --> 28:10.874
Trusting you was never in doubt.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.874
Is Calista okay?

28:16.874 --> 28:17.874
She is.

28:19.874 --> 28:21.874
Then the family is intact.

28:29.874 --> 28:30.874
What the fuck were you doing?

28:30.917 --> 28:32.873
I gave your friends
something to think about,

28:32.990 --> 28:35.617
in case they're not as
gullible as you believe.

28:35.742 --> 28:36.742
What?

28:37.200 --> 28:38.990
Level nine awaits.

28:44.990 --> 28:47.989
Shit, they're on level seven.

28:47.990 --> 28:49.658
They're on level two.

28:50.990 --> 28:52.990
I've got them on level three.

28:54.990 --> 28:56.110
Level six has been breached.

28:56.990 --> 28:58.989
Suppression units deploy to all levels.

28:59.235 --> 29:00.234
Deployed.

29:00.235 --> 29:03.234
We have got to get down to level nine, now.

29:03.235 --> 29:05.112
We are about to be blown.

29:05.235 --> 29:08.737
Sir, we have reports of Simons
on all levels, but look...

29:08.862 --> 29:11.234
They've hacked all the cameras.

29:11.235 --> 29:13.234
I'll initiate shutdown protocol.

29:13.235 --> 29:14.275
We will handle level nine.

29:15.235 --> 29:17.235
Keep level 13 secure.

29:24.070 --> 29:26.236
All units, level 13 protocols are in place.

29:28.235 --> 29:29.235
Thirteen?

29:42.235 --> 29:44.154
What the fuck?

30:05.235 --> 30:06.234
What did you do to them?

30:06.235 --> 30:08.234
I took care of it.

30:08.235 --> 30:10.234
You teleported them all away?

30:10.235 --> 30:12.234
Look, you let me handle the details.

30:12.235 --> 30:14.445
You just focus on getting what you want.

30:14.570 --> 30:16.235
That's where you excel.

30:17.235 --> 30:20.234
This is what I've been
able to come up with so far

30:20.327 --> 30:23.326
but I think it will do just what we need.

30:23.327 --> 30:25.326
This is the Master Drainer control panel.

30:25.327 --> 30:27.326
Royalle will not enter the cell

30:27.327 --> 30:29.327
unless this has been deactivated.

30:30.327 --> 30:32.037
But it's just a prop.

30:32.162 --> 30:34.326
- Pull out all the wires you like.
- Okay.

30:34.327 --> 30:35.912
Don't drop this.

30:38.327 --> 30:40.326
So, pull out some wires...

30:40.327 --> 30:42.326
The door opens, green light goes out.

30:42.327 --> 30:45.326
Yeah, we walk in, press the button.

30:45.327 --> 30:48.326
Door closes. Green light comes on.

30:48.327 --> 30:49.326
Click-click.

30:49.327 --> 30:51.326
By which time, we'll be on level nine.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.326
Right outside the door.

30:52.327 --> 30:55.326
But it has to happen fast.
No time for Royalle to think.

30:55.327 --> 30:57.326
And Wolfe's going to be heavily sedated.

30:57.327 --> 30:59.327
But once that green light turns off,

30:59.453 --> 31:01.326
he'll begin to wake almost immediately.

31:01.327 --> 31:04.326
Click-click. Get the Drainer back on.

31:04.327 --> 31:06.287
Sure. Click-click.

31:28.327 --> 31:30.246
Anything you want to do in there?

31:31.327 --> 31:32.327
No.

31:33.327 --> 31:35.327
Don't move. Face the wall!

31:37.327 --> 31:38.326
Fuck.

31:38.327 --> 31:40.327
Support unit incoming.

31:49.327 --> 31:50.327
Oh shit. What's he...

31:51.327 --> 31:53.326
You killed me.

31:53.327 --> 31:54.487
And now he's helped free you.

32:00.327 --> 32:04.326
I cleared the level. Guards incapacitated.

32:04.327 --> 32:05.453
Get yourself together.

32:05.578 --> 32:07.870
We'll pick you up when we're finished.

32:18.162 --> 32:19.327
Nothing to stop us now.

32:43.327 --> 32:44.453
Think that's going to keep me locked in?

32:44.620 --> 32:47.327
Simons was not part of the plan.

32:47.328 --> 32:49.326
Oh, he was.

32:49.327 --> 32:50.912
I just didn't tell you about it.

32:51.327 --> 32:52.327
I trusted you.

32:52.912 --> 32:54.326
And I you.

32:54.327 --> 32:58.326
But I'm not sure your
friends share that same faith.

32:58.327 --> 33:01.327
I released Simons to give them
something unexpected to deal with.

33:03.327 --> 33:04.703
Do you trust me?

33:07.327 --> 33:10.120
It's now or never.

33:10.246 --> 33:13.453
We walk in together, or I go in alone.

33:13.578 --> 33:15.327
Bullshit.

33:19.327 --> 33:20.870
Go ahead.

33:23.327 --> 33:24.327
Go in there.

33:27.327 --> 33:29.326
Shoot him in the head.

33:29.327 --> 33:32.327
Watch his brains splatter.

33:34.327 --> 33:35.327
Go on.

33:39.327 --> 33:42.326
I knew it. Fuck.

33:42.327 --> 33:43.327
Give me the gun.

33:44.703 --> 33:46.287
What?

33:46.327 --> 33:48.326
I'm not going to go in
there and have you hesitate.

33:48.327 --> 33:50.327
Give me the gun. I'll do it.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.327
We're running out of time, Johnny.

34:00.370 --> 34:03.327
I can do it. Give me the gun.

34:05.327 --> 34:08.326
When he got loose,

34:08.327 --> 34:10.327
I had my hand on his throat.

34:13.327 --> 34:14.327
I couldn't do it.

34:17.327 --> 34:18.453
I can do it for both of us.

34:23.327 --> 34:24.745
Come on.

34:44.327 --> 34:45.326
Shit.

34:45.327 --> 34:47.326
He wasn't supposed to lock the door.

34:47.327 --> 34:48.326
If he goes for his powers...

34:48.327 --> 34:51.326
If he goes for his powers,
we stick with the plan.

34:51.327 --> 34:53.327
No, he won't. There's too much at risk.

35:22.327 --> 35:23.327
Okay.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.327
Fucking...

36:05.870 --> 36:07.326
So do it!

36:07.327 --> 36:09.327
My affairs are in order.

36:13.327 --> 36:15.327
Look after Calista.

36:19.787 --> 36:21.954
Get on your knees.

36:22.079 --> 36:24.954
Put your hands on your head.
You're under arrest, Johnny.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.327
Fuck.

36:40.327 --> 36:43.326
There's still time.

36:43.327 --> 36:45.326
You can still kill him, Christian.

36:45.327 --> 36:46.327
Before they get here.

36:47.327 --> 36:49.326
Blame it on me.

36:49.327 --> 36:51.326
I don't care anymore.

36:51.327 --> 36:52.326
You can be the hero again.

36:52.327 --> 36:54.327
I was never a hero.

36:55.327 --> 36:56.326
I was a Power.

36:56.327 --> 36:58.327
No, Christian, there's no time. Kill him!

37:08.327 --> 37:10.327
Here we go, old man.

37:13.327 --> 37:14.328
Here we go.

37:17.327 --> 37:18.327
What the fuck?

37:24.495 --> 37:26.327
Fuck.

37:30.662 --> 37:32.326
What the hell did you... what did you do?

37:32.327 --> 37:34.829
Covered your back.

37:34.954 --> 37:37.326
I wasn't going to let you
go off the roof this time.

37:37.327 --> 37:39.326
Where's Wolfe? What did you do?

37:39.327 --> 37:41.328
- We have Wolfe in hand.
- Where?

37:41.453 --> 37:43.453
Level 13 status?

37:43.578 --> 37:45.327
Level 13 is secure.

37:47.327 --> 37:48.327
Wolfe is secure.

37:50.327 --> 37:53.326
Prepare for transfer to level
nine. Support unit on its way.

37:53.327 --> 37:55.326
Wait. Level 13?

37:55.327 --> 37:57.327
We couldn't leave him in here, Walker.

37:57.662 --> 37:59.327
We couldn't trust you.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.327
Let's get this battery hooked up.

38:23.327 --> 38:24.367
Is this why Johnny's here?

38:25.037 --> 38:26.327
I'm why Johnny's here.

38:28.148 --> 38:29.481
Johnny can kill 20 birds with one stone.

38:29.606 --> 38:33.437
Hey, level 13, get the news.
Johnny Royalle is in custody.

38:33.438 --> 38:36.522
I repeat, Johnny Royalle is in custody.

38:38.438 --> 38:39.648
Level 13?

38:40.438 --> 38:42.438
Level 13, do you read?

38:44.438 --> 38:45.438
Yeah, we read.

38:47.438 --> 38:49.398
Everything is secure down here.

38:50.438 --> 38:51.437
Over.

38:51.438 --> 38:52.438
What are we going to do?

38:56.856 --> 38:58.606
What the fuck you doing?

39:05.438 --> 39:06.438
I'm afraid.

39:24.106 --> 39:25.273
Hello.

39:25.439 --> 39:27.148
They caught Johnny.

39:27.438 --> 39:28.438
Did they?

39:29.438 --> 39:31.437
You're free.

39:31.438 --> 39:32.438
Now, help me get him out.

39:41.438 --> 39:43.438
But I have a question.

39:46.065 --> 39:48.438
Why do you smell like me?

39:59.273 --> 40:00.438
I don't wanna die alone.

40:01.438 --> 40:05.438
You are not alone.

40:30.438 --> 40:32.437
Take Wolfe back to his cell.

40:32.438 --> 40:35.437
Stick Royalle in a pod until
I have a cell ready for him.

40:35.438 --> 40:37.437
I did what I said I would do.

40:37.438 --> 40:39.438
We saved your ass from
making another huge mistake.

40:48.522 --> 40:51.648
I'd rather not have
blood on myself anymore.

40:54.438 --> 40:55.438
Mine or yours.

40:59.814 --> 41:00.814
Gracious of you.

41:03.438 --> 41:04.438
And...

41:05.438 --> 41:06.438
I could kill you.

41:07.438 --> 41:09.438
Finally lick the plate clean.

41:11.438 --> 41:15.438
But there doesn't seem to
be anything left to lick.

41:20.898 --> 41:22.940
Christian, get Johnny.

41:23.438 --> 41:26.648
I want to talk to you boys.

41:26.814 --> 41:28.438
We're going to have words.

41:37.084 --> 41:42.028
