WEBVTT

00:06.556 --> 00:08.888
Hello? What?

00:10.660 --> 00:12.218
I can't understand you.

00:12.295 --> 00:13.387
Who is it?

00:13.463 --> 00:15.226
I don't know. Some woman crying.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.991
Hold on. Charlie?

00:19.235 --> 00:20.827
- What?
- Phone for you.

00:22.839 --> 00:24.898
- Who is it?
- A hysterical woman.

00:26.843 --> 00:30.301
Are you insane?
I don't take calls from hysterical women.

00:30.413 --> 00:31.778
Here he is.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.748
You are very insensitive.

00:37.921 --> 00:40.446
Hello? Oh, hey. How are you?

00:41.091 --> 00:42.854
She's crying. Duh.

00:43.593 --> 00:47.256
Okay, calm down. I can't understand you.

00:49.032 --> 00:51.626
Omelet? What is "omelet"?

00:53.036 --> 00:54.799
Oh, I'm late.

00:56.506 --> 00:58.303
What are you late for, hon?

01:01.044 --> 01:03.877
- Get him out of here.
- Jake, go watch TV.

01:03.980 --> 01:06.881
What's the big deal?
I don't cry when I'm late.

01:10.687 --> 01:13.155
Okay, are you sure? Don't yell.

01:13.923 --> 01:16.357
How did this... Scratch that.

01:17.227 --> 01:19.991
Okay. Just stay calm, I'm here for you.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.590
We'll deal with this together.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.364
You didn't happen
to catch her name, did you?

01:34.477 --> 01:36.968
Okay, the instructions sound pretty clear.

01:37.547 --> 01:39.071
You pee on the stick,

01:40.583 --> 01:43.677
and if it turns blue
it means you're pregnant.

01:45.054 --> 01:46.851
The stick turns blue.

01:50.326 --> 01:53.227
Yes, sweetheart,
first go into the bathroom.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.389
Not exactly a rocket scientist.

01:56.466 --> 01:59.697
As opposed to the Nobel Prize winners
you usually bring home.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.865
I'm still here. Go ahead, let her rip.

02:07.944 --> 02:09.604
What do you mean you can't?

02:11.214 --> 02:12.442
Hold on.

02:19.055 --> 02:20.249
How's that?

02:22.258 --> 02:26.126
Yeah, I'm a genius.
Now we wait 30 seconds.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.055
Please, God. Please, God, please.

02:30.133 --> 02:32.158
Isn't it a little late for prayer, Charlie?

02:32.268 --> 02:34.099
Hey, don't mock my faith.

02:35.471 --> 02:37.996
Yeah, I'm here. Did it change colors?

02:39.275 --> 02:41.835
No? That's good, right?

02:43.279 --> 02:46.442
Sure, in a strange way
I'm a little disappointed, too.

02:48.685 --> 02:51.153
Hold on a sec. Yes!

02:59.329 --> 03:00.819
So, what else is new?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.865
Hey, congratulations.
When's the wedding?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.703
Isn't that nice?

03:08.972 --> 03:10.963
Best of luck. Bye-bye.

03:13.309 --> 03:16.437
Boy, don't you just hate
when that happens?

03:16.512 --> 03:20.209
Wait, so this is a common occurrence?
Don't you take precautions?

03:20.383 --> 03:21.850
Of course.

03:22.118 --> 03:26.111
But, come on, you've never found yourself
in a slow elevator without a condom?

03:28.024 --> 03:29.685
Look who I'm asking.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.854
Okay, so we need soap,

03:34.964 --> 03:37.956
razor blades, cotton balls.

03:38.034 --> 03:40.867
- Cotton balls, that reminds me.
- Reminds you of what?

03:41.537 --> 03:43.198
Ribbed, for her pleasure.

03:45.008 --> 03:46.669
Ultra thin, for mine.

03:47.977 --> 03:51.071
Fiesta colors for, I suppose, fiestas.

03:52.181 --> 03:56.880
And extra-strength, double latex,
for coyote Tuesdays.

03:59.255 --> 04:01.689
Boy, if women knew the trouble we go to.

04:01.758 --> 04:03.851
Why don't you just get snipped?

04:04.193 --> 04:05.888
- You mean a vasectomy?
- Yeah.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.395
Then say "vasectomy. "
Don't say "snipped. "

04:08.598 --> 04:11.032
- What's wrong with "snipped"?
- It's demeaning.

04:11.100 --> 04:13.830
Snipped is what you get
for $12 at Supercuts.

04:14.370 --> 04:16.565
Fine. Why don't you get a vasectomy?

04:16.873 --> 04:18.204
I've considered it.

04:18.408 --> 04:22.367
In fact, a couple of years ago
I believe there was a petition circulating.

04:22.879 --> 04:24.471
So, what's holding you back?

04:24.814 --> 04:27.044
I don't know,
it's kind of a permanent move.

04:27.216 --> 04:29.810
What happens if one day
I finally meet the right woman

04:29.919 --> 04:31.750
and decide I want to raise a family?

04:33.923 --> 04:35.823
Don't cry. Look.

04:37.927 --> 04:41.055
You want to see Daddy dance?
You like to see Daddy dance.

04:41.264 --> 04:43.061
Look at Daddy dance.

04:44.567 --> 04:45.829
Who am I kidding?

04:48.938 --> 04:50.735
Sweetheart, I have to go. I've a patient.

04:51.507 --> 04:54.908
No, you just stay off your feet.
Remember, you're very pregnant.

04:55.445 --> 04:56.503
Huge.

04:56.612 --> 04:58.307
Yeah, I love you, too.

04:58.648 --> 05:01.845
I know. We're going to have a baby.

05:02.151 --> 05:05.848
Yes, we are. Okay, sweetie, bye-bye.

05:06.022 --> 05:08.490
So, Mr. Harper, you want a vasectomy?

05:08.925 --> 05:11.155
Yes. You do that, right?

05:11.260 --> 05:14.252
Of course we do.
In the exam room next door. Snip, snip.

05:16.032 --> 05:19.092
Great. I just have a couple of
pre-snip questions.

05:19.168 --> 05:22.035
Shoot. Which, by the way,
you'll still do post-snip,

05:22.138 --> 05:23.969
if that was one of your questions.

05:24.640 --> 05:25.868
Good.

05:25.975 --> 05:29.502
Of course, if I've done my job right,
you'll be shooting blanks. Yeah?

05:29.612 --> 05:31.102
Yeah, I got that.

05:32.215 --> 05:35.048
What I was wondering is
if there's any permanent effects.

05:35.151 --> 05:36.982
You mean like sexual impairment?

05:37.220 --> 05:38.687
No. Wait a minute.

05:40.556 --> 05:42.353
There can be sexual impairment?

05:42.959 --> 05:45.689
No, I just wanted to see
the look on your face.

05:45.828 --> 05:49.059
No, actually, you'll be able to perform
exactly as you did before.

05:49.165 --> 05:50.359
Great.

05:50.867 --> 05:53.199
But what about like creativity?

05:53.970 --> 05:57.701
See, I write music for a living.
Will I still be able to do that?

05:58.875 --> 06:00.672
Do you write with your testicles?

06:04.647 --> 06:05.773
No.

06:05.848 --> 06:09.306
Then it shouldn't be a problem.
Now, let me ask you a question.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.376
- Do you have children already?
- No.

06:11.487 --> 06:14.285
Then you might want to
think about freezing some sperm

06:14.357 --> 06:15.847
in case you ever change your mind.

06:15.992 --> 06:18.290
- Frozen sperm? I don't know.
- Why not?

06:18.694 --> 06:22.494
You know, you freeze shrimp,
it's never as good as fresh.

06:23.332 --> 06:25.323
That's really not the same thing.

06:25.635 --> 06:29.662
So you know for a fact that frozen kids
are just the same as the regulars?

06:30.540 --> 06:32.064
Yeah, pretty much.

06:32.241 --> 06:35.733
Of course, when they grow up
they do tend to migrate to the Sunbelt.

06:37.413 --> 06:40.610
Nothing? Wow. That one kills
at urology conventions.

06:42.251 --> 06:44.082
Excuse me. Yes?

06:44.921 --> 06:46.582
Put her on. It's my wife.

06:47.090 --> 06:48.387
Hi, honey.

06:48.724 --> 06:51.591
No kidding, she's really
kicking up a storm, huh?

06:51.694 --> 06:53.127
Yeah, we know it's a girl.

06:53.596 --> 06:55.029
- Good.
- Hang on.

06:55.531 --> 06:57.795
Do you like Brittany or Allison for a name?

06:58.234 --> 07:00.532
- They're both nice.
- Yeah.

07:00.603 --> 07:04.266
Okay, honey, let me get this guy
out of here and I'll call you back.

07:04.774 --> 07:06.207
Okay, Mommy.

07:06.542 --> 07:08.533
Yeah, you're going to be a mommy.

07:08.778 --> 07:10.211
Yes, you are.

07:12.081 --> 07:13.742
So, frozen sperm.

07:15.218 --> 07:18.676
I'm just not really sure
I want to go into some little room

07:18.754 --> 07:20.244
with a bunch of magazines
and you know...

07:20.323 --> 07:22.450
Actually, we have videos now. Kind of hot.

07:23.759 --> 07:26.660
You don't have to do it here.
We'll give you a container,

07:26.762 --> 07:28.923
you can go home,
make yourself comfortable,

07:28.998 --> 07:31.466
dim the lights,
put on a little sweet soul music...

07:31.567 --> 07:33.091
I know the procedure.

07:33.169 --> 07:37.071
Then just bring it back here while
the little fellas are still swimming,

07:37.140 --> 07:39.040
and we'll turn them into Popsicles.

07:39.108 --> 07:40.336
Popsicles?

07:40.443 --> 07:42.638
You know, in case
someday you want to be a pop.

07:44.347 --> 07:47.316
Yeah. Very clever.

07:47.416 --> 07:52.115
You deal with prostates and penises
all day, you better have a sense of humor.

07:52.588 --> 07:53.816
And warm hands.

07:53.923 --> 07:55.823
That's good, I'll use that.

07:55.925 --> 07:57.950
Warm hands. That's good. Yeah.

08:01.797 --> 08:03.856
I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

08:04.967 --> 08:08.528
Jake, Grandma came all the way
over here to spend some time with you.

08:08.604 --> 08:12.506
Alan, don't use guilt
as a control mechanism.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.969
He should only spend time with me
if he wants to.

08:22.018 --> 08:23.679
So I can go, right?

08:26.155 --> 08:27.349
Run.

08:29.892 --> 08:30.984
Good morning.

08:31.060 --> 08:33.323
- Good morning, darling.
- Morning, Charlie.

08:33.563 --> 08:36.030
Charlie, what's wrong with your pee-pee?

08:38.868 --> 08:40.028
What?

08:40.135 --> 08:43.572
A little birdie told me you were in
a urologist's office yesterday.

08:43.673 --> 08:45.163
Thanks a lot, Tweety.

08:45.841 --> 08:47.331
I didn't say anything.

08:47.410 --> 08:51.540
Coincidentally, your doctor has a suite
in the same building as Dr. Shankman.

08:51.647 --> 08:55.242
The man responsible for one
out of three tight tushies in Beverly Hills.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.876
So, Dr. Shankman saw me and told you?

08:57.987 --> 09:00.421
No, you left your appointment card
on the table here.

09:00.523 --> 09:05.051
I just brought up Dr. Shankman because
no one has noticed my new tushie.

09:07.897 --> 09:09.228
Very nice, Mom.

09:09.332 --> 09:11.527
Of course. It's a Shankman.

09:14.203 --> 09:16.262
So, Charles, back to your pee-pee.

09:17.506 --> 09:19.599
I'm done. Can I go play in my room?

09:20.509 --> 09:23.603
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm just getting a vasectomy.

09:25.514 --> 09:27.379
You must really hate me.

09:28.884 --> 09:30.545
Are we changing the subject?

09:31.387 --> 09:34.584
How can you have a vasectomy
without consulting me?

09:34.690 --> 09:37.523
You're selfishly robbing me
of grandchildren.

09:37.693 --> 09:40.685
- You've got grandchildren.
- Oh, big whoop, one.

09:42.965 --> 09:46.298
If it makes you feel any better,
I'm going to do the freezing thing.

09:46.402 --> 09:47.596
Really?

09:48.104 --> 09:50.368
I suppose that's better than nothing.

09:51.440 --> 09:54.273
You know, I'm doing a freezing thing, too.

09:54.744 --> 09:56.268
- What?
- Excuse me?

09:56.345 --> 09:59.803
At death, I plan to have my head
removed and frozen until such time

09:59.915 --> 10:02.179
as it can be revived
and put on a monkey body.

10:06.455 --> 10:08.923
What? Everybody's doing it.

10:10.000 --> 10:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:19.101 --> 10:21.035
Charlie, you got somebody in there?

10:21.671 --> 10:22.933
No.

10:23.773 --> 10:25.764
I need to get your towels.

10:26.809 --> 10:28.538
I really wish you wouldn't.

10:28.644 --> 10:32.671
Come on, I'm doing laundry.
I want to finish a load before I go.

10:33.883 --> 10:35.976
Yeah. Well, me, too.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.621
- What?
- Never mind, just go away.

10:41.791 --> 10:44.988
All right. If it helps, you can think of me.

10:51.801 --> 10:53.200
Charlie, wait a second.

10:53.302 --> 10:55.532
I don't have to pick up Jake
till after dinner.

10:55.638 --> 10:57.037
You want to catch an early movie?

10:57.139 --> 11:00.540
Maybe. But I gotta make one stop first.
Come on.

11:05.414 --> 11:06.881
So, what's in the bag?

11:07.917 --> 11:10.545
- Sperm.
- No, really.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.311
Sperm.

11:16.359 --> 11:19.886
- Whose sperm?
- Seabiscuit's. Who do you think? Mine.

11:22.164 --> 11:23.927
I thought we were going to a movie.

11:25.034 --> 11:28.367
Yeah, but first I'm having my sperm frozen
and getting a vasectomy.

11:31.907 --> 11:34.102
I could've met you at the theater,
you know.

11:34.677 --> 11:36.008
Just hold the bag.

11:40.015 --> 11:43.178
There is another container
inside this bag, right?

11:44.019 --> 11:47.011
Of course.
You just gotta keep it out of the sunlight.

11:47.356 --> 11:50.450
Why? Is it vampire sperm?

11:54.730 --> 11:57.756
Jeez. He's gonna want to look in the bag.

11:57.867 --> 11:59.027
God.

11:59.902 --> 12:01.028
No!

12:02.571 --> 12:05.631
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I don't know, I panicked.

12:14.884 --> 12:17.580
- Hey, Charlie!
- What?

12:17.653 --> 12:20.087
Are you nuts?
You can't put that in the freezer.

12:20.389 --> 12:21.947
It's ice cream.

12:23.626 --> 12:25.617
Store-bought, not hand-cranked.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.429
Yeah, you're hilarious.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.292
You're lucky I'm still talking to you

12:31.367 --> 12:33.699
after tossing my swimmers
on the Coast Highway.

12:34.703 --> 12:36.170
- What?
- It's nothing.

12:36.272 --> 12:39.469
Thanks to you, I got to reschedule
the whole deal for this afternoon.

12:39.542 --> 12:41.476
- What whole deal?
- It's not important, Jake.

12:41.544 --> 12:43.011
Why shouldn't he know?

12:43.112 --> 12:45.444
Okay, go ahead. Explain it to him.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.483
Well, Jake,

12:50.352 --> 12:52.684
your uncle Charlie is getting a vasectomy.

12:56.125 --> 12:58.116
What's wrong with the car you have now?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.666
Well done.

13:07.336 --> 13:09.327
All right, let me try again.

13:10.639 --> 13:12.903
A vasectomy is a very simple operation.

13:13.008 --> 13:16.307
- Are you sick?
- No. I'm perfectly healthy.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.337
It's a procedure so that
I don't have babies by accident.

13:20.983 --> 13:23.178
Yeah, like we had to do with Scout.

13:24.386 --> 13:25.648
Scout?

13:25.721 --> 13:28.053
The dog we had. Couldn't keep it in his fur.

13:29.558 --> 13:31.219
Keep going, you're doing great.

13:32.495 --> 13:35.362
Jake, it's not exactly the same
with people as with dogs.

13:35.431 --> 13:36.591
I know.

13:41.370 --> 13:43.065
Why don't you just use a condom?

13:52.948 --> 13:55.439
I guess he knows more than he lets on.

13:58.454 --> 14:00.752
- You do, don't you?
- I hear things.

14:03.893 --> 14:05.520
Thanks for babysitting, Rose.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.119
My pleasure. Is Charlie gonna be okay?

14:08.230 --> 14:10.596
Yeah. He's just having
a little procedure done,

14:10.699 --> 14:12.724
and I need to be there to drive him home.

14:12.801 --> 14:15.269
- What kind of procedure?
- It's personal.

14:16.038 --> 14:18.131
I understand. Where is he?

14:18.741 --> 14:22.768
Upstairs, getting ready.
Throwing a few things in a bag.

14:23.746 --> 14:26.078
- I'll tell Jake you're here.
- Okay.

14:38.994 --> 14:41.087
- Charlie?
- Rose, for God's sake!

14:42.197 --> 14:45.689
- You need a hand?
- No, get out.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.998
- Charlie?
- What?

14:54.043 --> 14:57.444
- What's the little cup for?
- Go away, Rose.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.478
Don't be embarrassed.

14:59.548 --> 15:02.540
That's a perfectly natural way
to relieve stress.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.142
You know what I do? Jumping jacks.

15:05.621 --> 15:07.111
Rose, please.

15:07.556 --> 15:11.788
The only downside is, when I exercise,
I get all hot and sweaty,

15:11.860 --> 15:14.556
and my clothes start clinging to my body.

15:14.663 --> 15:18.190
So then I have to go
and take a nice, hot, soapy shower.

15:21.070 --> 15:22.298
Then what?

15:24.740 --> 15:25.968
Rose?

15:27.643 --> 15:28.837
Oh, damn.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.076
Look, I'm sorry I walked in on you.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.345
I thought you were finished
with the video and everything.

15:36.418 --> 15:38.978
- Forget it, Alan.
- I wish I could.

15:40.823 --> 15:43.417
Why didn't you hang a sock
on the doorknob?

15:43.525 --> 15:44.719
It wouldn't have helped.

15:44.827 --> 15:47.261
Obviously, a power
much greater than myself

15:47.363 --> 15:49.160
doesn't want me to freeze my sperm.

15:49.231 --> 15:51.825
If you don't, and you go ahead
with this vasectomy,

15:51.900 --> 15:53.731
you'll never be able to have children.

15:53.836 --> 15:57.772
What difference does it make?
We both know I'm not daddy material.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.331
No, not now, or any time soon,

16:01.410 --> 16:04.379
but who knows,
maybe in the distant monkey-body future.

16:05.948 --> 16:08.712
Look, this is my life.
I know what's best for me.

16:09.685 --> 16:12.745
Okay, Mr. Harper.

16:12.855 --> 16:14.846
Why don't you jump up on the table,

16:14.923 --> 16:17.858
put your legs in the stirrups
and we'll get you shaved.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.865
Damn, I didn't bring the camcorder.

16:25.868 --> 16:28.393
- Thanks, Alan. I'll see you later.
- Yeah. Good luck.

16:28.470 --> 16:32.964
Don't forget to put a cone around his head
so he doesn't bite at the stitches.

16:36.645 --> 16:37.771
All right,

16:39.181 --> 16:40.910
let's have a look.

16:42.651 --> 16:45.085
Okay, in my defense,
it's a little cold in here.

16:46.188 --> 16:48.986
Boy, if I had a nickel
for every time I heard that.

17:07.309 --> 17:10.506
So, what's your name?

17:11.646 --> 17:12.840
Naomi.

17:13.214 --> 17:15.444
Let me ask you something, Naomi.

17:15.517 --> 17:19.476
Does doing this make you want
to have dinner with me more or less?

17:19.555 --> 17:23.958
Just a reminder, Mr. Harper,
I'm holding a razor to your genitals.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.054
I know, but how "meet cute" is this?

17:28.329 --> 17:30.560
What a great story to tell our...

17:33.535 --> 17:34.832
Our what?

17:36.004 --> 17:37.232
Never mind.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.966
- Okay, all done.
- That was quick.

17:42.044 --> 17:45.207
You got a little mirror
so I can check out the back?

17:45.848 --> 17:47.145
Not that little.

17:49.351 --> 17:52.548
Come on, honey. I know. Breathe with me.

17:53.922 --> 17:55.253
All right, that's good.

17:55.357 --> 17:58.520
I gotta do one quick snip
and then I'll meet you at the hospital.

17:58.594 --> 18:00.721
- Excuse me, quick snip?
- No, thanks, I'm fine.

18:00.829 --> 18:04.094
Yeah. I love you, too.
Breathe, honey. Just breathe.

18:04.399 --> 18:07.994
Okay, bye-bye. It's getting exciting now.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.998
Okay, let's see what we're up against here.

18:11.106 --> 18:12.767
Woof. That's quite a haircut.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.901
Looks like my grandma in a bathing cap.

18:19.214 --> 18:21.205
Okay, Mr. Harper,

18:21.884 --> 18:23.852
I'm gonna give you
a local anesthetic here

18:23.919 --> 18:25.614
so you're gonna feel a little sting.

18:25.721 --> 18:28.781
Just let me know when you're about to.
Holy Mother of God!

18:30.559 --> 18:33.892
Okay, here it comes. Kidding.

18:35.464 --> 18:36.624
I got you.

18:36.732 --> 18:39.394
Now, we'll just give it a minute
till we're nice and numb.

18:39.468 --> 18:42.631
You know, we're thinking Juliet now,
or maybe Julianne.

18:42.738 --> 18:44.069
Both good names.

18:44.139 --> 18:48.132
Yeah, you want a name that fits a child,
but also is appropriate for an adult.

18:48.243 --> 18:49.608
Can you feel my finger?

18:50.412 --> 18:52.972
What finger? Why? What are you doing?

18:53.081 --> 18:55.242
Okay, let's start snipping.

18:58.253 --> 19:00.585
Naomi, could you get that for me?

19:03.292 --> 19:07.160
Hello? Hi, honey. No, I can talk.

19:08.997 --> 19:12.660
What, you're kidding, already?
Okay, don't panic, I'm on my way.

19:12.768 --> 19:15.328
Okay, this is a little embarrassing,
but I have to go.

19:15.437 --> 19:18.531
Why don't you see to it that
Mr. Harper has another appointment?

19:18.640 --> 19:20.835
And no charge for the haircut. Yeah.

19:21.543 --> 19:23.135
I'm gonna be a daddy.

19:28.684 --> 19:30.675
Man, he looks really happy.

19:30.786 --> 19:33.346
Yeah, they've been trying for a long time.

19:34.723 --> 19:36.623
You can put your legs down now.

19:37.893 --> 19:39.952
Yeah, that's one option.

19:48.303 --> 19:50.737
- Unbelievable.
- Let it go, Alan.

19:50.839 --> 19:54.366
Who goes in for a vasectomy
and comes out with a date?

19:55.177 --> 19:57.168
What? I'm a man, she's a woman.

19:57.246 --> 19:59.373
A woman who two minutes
after you met her

19:59.481 --> 20:00.880
was shaving your scrotum.

20:01.316 --> 20:02.908
So we skipped ahead a little.

20:05.721 --> 20:08.713
- You feeling any calmer, Uncle Charlie?
- What do you mean?

20:08.824 --> 20:11.554
When Scout had his operation,
he got real calm.

20:12.194 --> 20:15.061
Then he got fat and only wanted
to sleep behind the dryer.

20:16.698 --> 20:19.098
Okay, first of all,
it's not the same operation.

20:19.201 --> 20:21.169
And second of all, I didn't even have it.

20:21.236 --> 20:25.036
- So you're gonna have kids?
- I don't know. Maybe some day.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.038
I hope so, because you'd be a cool dad.

20:29.611 --> 20:30.669
Really?

20:34.917 --> 20:36.782
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

20:37.352 --> 20:39.411
So, you're not gonna have the vasectomy?

20:39.521 --> 20:42.183
I tried my best,
but it just wasn't meant to be.

20:42.257 --> 20:43.690
What do you mean?

20:43.759 --> 20:47.388
Do you think it was a coincidence
that my urologist was having a baby

20:47.462 --> 20:50.397
at the very moment
I was about to get snipped?

20:50.465 --> 20:52.865
I mean, I'm not
a particularly religious guy,

20:52.935 --> 20:56.063
but clearly a power
much greater than myself

20:56.605 --> 20:58.903
wants me to
knock somebody up some day.

21:01.743 --> 21:02.869
You called?

21:31.773 --> 21:32.967
English
