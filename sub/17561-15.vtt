00:08.007 --> 00:09.884
There's just one
problem with it.

00:09.968 --> 00:11.344
What's that, baby?

00:11.428 --> 00:14.597

blacked out,
and woke up married to you.

09:17.682 --> 09:20.476
She looked like Martin Short.

09:20.559 --> 09:22.144
Okay. 8 O'clock sharp.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.146
My house.
Chick flicks. Movie candy.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.898
Naked wrestling!

09:27.525 --> 09:29.735
Just tops.

09:31.320 --> 09:33.322
You know, I would have
been okay with everything.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.075
Eh, you're a whore.

09:38.869 --> 09:41.622
Excuse me.
I'm lookin' for Holly Tyler.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.833
- Cute purse.
- Oh, thank you, ma'am,

09:43.916 --> 09:46.419
But it's not mine.
It belongs to Holly Tyler.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.879
Oh, my God. That's
the purse the mugger stole?

09:48.963 --> 09:50.464
Yes, um, no sign
of the lip gloss

09:50.548 --> 09:52.800
but we've got our
best man on it.

09:52.883 --> 09:55.386
- You're funny.
- Thank you, ma'am.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.014
It's not a crime
to make you laugh.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.807
I'm Tina.
I'm Holly's friend.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.059
Nice to meet you.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.769
I interrogated
Holly extensively

10:03.853 --> 10:05.313
but she said nothing
about being friends

10:05.396 --> 10:08.065
with the most beautiful
girl in New York City.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.608
[gagging]

10:12.445 --> 10:15.114
So, listen, this might be
a little forward of me

10:15.197 --> 10:16.282
but I thought, maybe--

10:16.365 --> 10:17.950
Pick me up here.
8 O'clock?

10:18.034 --> 10:20.119
I'll see you then. Okay.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.290
Hey. What is wrong
with you?

10:24.373 --> 10:26.167
You can't go out
with him tonight.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.377
Tonight is our,
"We have no men in our lives

10:28.461 --> 10:29.920
so we have to be
with Holly" night.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.757
Ah, correction.
You have no men in your life.

10:32.840 --> 10:36.635
Well, I think your
behavior is awful.

10:37.720 --> 10:41.057
I can't even look
at you right now.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.725
Hey, Marcus.

10:42.808 --> 10:43.851
What's the matter, muffin?

10:43.934 --> 10:46.854
You seem a little down.

10:46.937 --> 10:49.899
It's that girl.
She's so cold.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.735
Our friend
is deeply depressed

10:52.818 --> 10:54.904
so we made plans to have
a girls' night tonight

10:54.987 --> 10:56.781
and that one just bails.

10:56.864 --> 10:58.074
Oh.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.658
Damn, I was hoping
you were free.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.410
I came here to ask
you out tonight.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.537
I'm in. What time?

11:04.330 --> 11:06.874
[instrumental music]

11:11.212 --> 11:12.463
You know what?

11:12.546 --> 11:14.256
I'm sorry I ever went
down to five kids.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.094
I want 19 kids,
and 2 dogs.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.470
And I don't even
want two anymore.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.305
In fact, I'm getting
my tubes tied.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.015
Oh, well, it's not like

11:23.099 --> 11:24.642
it's really gonna matter
because, apparently

11:24.725 --> 11:26.060
we're never gonna do it.

11:26.143 --> 11:28.479
Oh, God knows why,
I mean look at you.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.940
You are such an incredible
turn-on right now.

11:31.023 --> 11:32.983
Oh, yeah, and you
should see you.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.152
I mean, you're making
me real hot, baby.

11:35.236 --> 11:37.279
Real hot.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.532
Oh, so you don't
want to do it?

11:39.615 --> 11:41.909
Oh, I'd still do it.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.998
Now, are you gonna
come meet my brothers?

11:48.082 --> 11:50.292
No. What is the point?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.962
Why bother memorizing
all those names?

11:53.045 --> 11:54.964
So you're just gonna sit
in the car the whole night?

11:55.047 --> 11:57.007
Yes.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.473
You want me to bring
you a plate of ziti?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.559
Do you know
nothing of me?

12:06.642 --> 12:08.853
I do not allow eating
in my car.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.941
[instrumental music]

12:15.901 --> 12:19.280
I like Thelma so much
better than Louise.

12:19.363 --> 12:20.739
Don't you, Tina?

12:24.869 --> 12:27.121
Lauren, can you believe her?

12:36.213 --> 12:38.799
Tina, I'd like
to speak to you.

12:40.342 --> 12:42.428
Tina.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.763
- Tina! Come over here!
- What?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.099
We are supposed to be
having a girls' night.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.851
We are supposed
to be having fun

12:48.934 --> 12:50.352
laughing, watching a movie.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.729
I'm having fun

12:51.812 --> 12:53.355
and you're watching
a movie.

12:54.732 --> 12:57.359
This was supposed to be
about not men.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.486
You were supposed
to help me

12:58.569 --> 13:00.571
get through my
Vince thing.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.239
I mean, God, you're
my best friend.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.532
When Rubin breaks
up with you

13:03.616 --> 13:06.785
I'm gonna be your
support system.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.622
I'm sorry. You're right.
I'm so selfish.

13:09.705 --> 13:11.707
- I'll get rid of Rubin.
- Thank you.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.543
Okay, Rubin.
I am so sorry

13:14.627 --> 13:17.671
but I am gonna have
to say goodnight.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.389
[dialing]

13:27.473 --> 13:29.725
Val, you left me a message
telling me where you'd be

13:29.808 --> 13:31.393
in case of an emergency

13:31.477 --> 13:33.145
and I'm having one.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.481
I'm on my way.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.739
Oh, oh, oh, muffin.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.996
[instrumental music]

13:55.000 --> 13:57.002
What is that?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.921
I didn't think you should
be out here alone.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.757
No, that, that
red saucy stuff

14:01.840 --> 14:04.093
on the plate in my car.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.054
It's baked ziti.
Okay. Come on.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.931
- You want a taste?
- Aah, no, no!

14:09.014 --> 14:12.768
Get that I-talian food
out of my interior.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.895
I told you,
no food in the car.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.814
I'm sorry. What?
I couldn't hear you.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.649
I was chewing.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.193
Oh, my God,
this is so good.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.195
And I was so, so hungry.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.947
I bet, I bet you're
hungry too.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.992
But you know what,
I understand.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.327
You made a decision,
no eating in the car.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.580
And once Val makes
a decision..

14:32.663 --> 14:34.707
...it's the law.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.626
I know what you're
trying to do.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.546
You're trying to compare the
ziti to the children situation.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.339
Oh, come on, don't
be ridiculous.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.466
I would never eat
our children.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.219
[instrumental music]

14:48.679 --> 14:49.930
- Come on
- You see what he's doing?

14:50.014 --> 14:51.599
He's cheating.
He gets that from Ma.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.142
Oh, you always complain
every time we play.

14:53.225 --> 14:56.020
Excuse me. Um, do you
guys know Vic Meladeo?

14:59.356 --> 15:01.066
Who's asking?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.737
I'm Holly Tyler.
I'm looking for my sister

15:04.820 --> 15:06.280
and she's married to Vic.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.823
Well, sort of.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.575
Hey, we're Vic's brothers.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.076
Val's a little tied up
with Vic right now

15:11.160 --> 15:12.828
but perhaps we can help.

15:12.911 --> 15:15.164
Well, you're kind
of family

15:15.247 --> 15:19.501
and two of you look
a little like Vic.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.670
God, I think I made
a terrible mistake

15:21.754 --> 15:23.213
breaking up
with my boyfriend.

15:23.297 --> 15:25.382
and I thought that the drive
over here would cheer me up

15:25.466 --> 15:27.593
but then...my
radio didn't work

15:27.676 --> 15:29.511
and I ran over a bunny.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.430
- Aw.
- Aw.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.973
A bunny?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.436
Come on.

15:37.519 --> 15:39.521
I'm just asking you
to bend the rules.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.982
Alright, take one
stinking bite.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.902
Come on. Compromise, Val.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.737
Come on. I'm Mr. Ziti.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.155
Eat me.

15:49.448 --> 15:52.368
No. No, I can't.

15:52.451 --> 15:55.162
I want to,
but I can't, okay?

15:55.245 --> 15:56.830
See, this is what I've
been trying to tell you.

15:56.914 --> 15:59.458
I can't compromise.

15:59.541 --> 16:00.542
I can't go with the flow.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.544
I can't leave the DVD
player running

16:02.628 --> 16:05.381
if nobody's watching it,
I'm a mess.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.675
I don't even know why you
would want to marry me.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.385
I mean I was <i> so</i>
happy for you

16:09.468 --> 16:10.719
when I found out that
we weren't married

16:10.803 --> 16:14.098
because I thought,
"Yay! Vic has an out! Ha-ha!"

16:15.057 --> 16:16.684
But you wouldn't go. No.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.186
I even showed you my crazy
but that didn't work, either.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.354
I mean you still wanted
to marry me.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.939
You wanted to have
six kids with me.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.357
Are you insane?

16:23.440 --> 16:25.859
Can you imagine six little
me's running around?

16:27.111 --> 16:29.571
Less and less.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.407
I'm sorry.
I really wanted us to work.

16:31.490 --> 16:34.326
I did. But I, I tried to warn
you, I tried to show--

16:34.410 --> 16:36.245
Val, look, would you
just stop it, okay?

16:36.328 --> 16:38.247
I'm not going anywhere.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.873
'Alright? How could I?'

16:39.957 --> 16:43.919
I mean come on, we
got 2 out of 10 right

16:44.002 --> 16:46.255
on that marriage
pamphlet, didn't we?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.758
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

16:55.222 --> 16:58.892
And that is a great foundation
to build a marriage on.

17:00.269 --> 17:02.938
And I don't believe
that you can't compromise

17:03.021 --> 17:04.647
or that you're not
capable of change

17:04.732 --> 17:06.900
because you said you would
never eat in the car

17:06.983 --> 17:09.111
and look at what you're
doing right now.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.948
Oh, my God.

17:13.031 --> 17:16.117
I'm eating I-talian
in the car.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.454
Yeah. See? See?

17:18.537 --> 17:20.289
Honey, you can do anything.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.249
I can. I can.

17:22.332 --> 17:23.834
Oh, my God, baby.

17:23.916 --> 17:25.877
- I just changed.
- Mm-hm.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.463
Do you think maybe I could
change other things

17:27.546 --> 17:32.176
like, um, like my, ah,
premarital break up fears

17:32.259 --> 17:34.470
or my post marital
break up fears?

17:34.553 --> 17:35.679
'Ooh, maybe'

17:35.763 --> 17:36.930
I can have three kids

17:37.014 --> 17:38.182
or maybe even four.

17:38.265 --> 17:39.808
Oh, well, actually,
I'm thinking that

17:39.892 --> 17:45.481
two of you running
around is <i> plenty.</i>

17:45.564 --> 17:47.649
Oh, whoops! Ha-ha!

17:50.402 --> 17:51.737
[instrumental music]

17:51.820 --> 17:53.781
So what if Vince
doesn't believe me

17:53.864 --> 17:55.365
about that stupid
Robyn girl?

17:55.449 --> 17:57.284
I should be able to
get past that, right?

17:57.367 --> 17:59.119
I mean, is it really
worth throwing my

17:59.203 --> 18:00.579
whole relationship away?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.581
Why would you want to be
in a relationship

18:02.664 --> 18:04.583
with a man who thinks
you're a liar?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.127
Personally,
I couldn't do it.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.547
So you guys think I made
the right decision

18:10.631 --> 18:11.840
by breaking up with him?

18:11.924 --> 18:12.841
Definitely.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.510
But I love him.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.804
This is why you're
so conflicted.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.723
Exactly.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.850
Sis, this Vince guy

18:21.934 --> 18:23.519
should be making
you feel loved

18:23.602 --> 18:25.562
and safe and cherished.

18:25.646 --> 18:27.481
And does he make you
feel that way?

18:27.564 --> 18:30.400
God, no, I feel crazy
and obsessed

18:30.484 --> 18:32.027
and I hate it.

18:32.110 --> 18:35.781
Oh, this is not what
love should be.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.826
Love should be warm
and exciting.

18:38.909 --> 18:41.161
It'll make the hair
on your back stand up.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.540
The way I see it

18:44.623 --> 18:46.625
the whole problem is trust.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.669
You're right.
He doesn't trust.

18:48.752 --> 18:52.714
No, you...don't trust yourself.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.425
Oh..

18:57.386 --> 18:59.471
Wait, what does that mean?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.479
- Holly?
- Hey, Val.

19:07.563 --> 19:08.814
Hey, what are doing here?

19:08.897 --> 19:11.358
Oh, wait, did you not
get my message?

19:11.441 --> 19:14.361
No. No, we were
eating in the car.

19:14.444 --> 19:18.156
- You?
- Yeah, I've changed.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.409
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I am now.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.578
Thanks to my big brothers.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.248
- So, you're Val?
- Yeah, ah, this is Val.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.083
Val, these are three
of my brothers.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.376

19:29.459 --> 19:30.460
Nice to meet you, Val.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.838
Why do you hate babies?

19:32.921 --> 19:34.798
She doesn't hate babies.

19:34.882 --> 19:38.260
I don't know. Where you come up
with this stuff?

19:38.343 --> 19:39.845
Okay, well, what are
you doing here?

19:39.928 --> 19:42.097
Well, I was upset,
and I needed to talk to you

19:42.180 --> 19:44.224
but then my new big
brothers filled in.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.767
They're very sensitive.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.103
I'm an artist.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.772
They made me feel better
about breaking up with Vince

19:50.856 --> 19:52.774
because my feelings
are totally valid.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.067
And I'm not crazy.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.904
Oh, well, he made me
see that I am crazy

19:56.987 --> 19:58.739
but he's into it.

19:58.822 --> 20:01.617
And Vic and I are
going to have

20:01.700 --> 20:03.118
two to four kids.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.370
- Alright!
- Alright!

20:05.454 --> 20:07.289
Tell 'em what else, baby.
Tell 'em what else

20:07.372 --> 20:08.999
Uh, Vic and I are--

20:09.082 --> 20:11.043
We're not married, but we're
getting married for real.

20:11.126 --> 20:14.296
- Alright!
- Vic, congratulations!

20:14.379 --> 20:15.839
Tell 'em where, baby.
Tell 'em where.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.507
We decided to have
the ceremony--

20:17.591 --> 20:19.635
Not at City Hall but at
some big, giant ballroom.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.678
Yeah!

20:21.762 --> 20:24.556
Okay, tell 'em why, baby.
Tell 'em why.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.141
Well, I thought
it would be--

20:26.224 --> 20:27.517
Nice to have the whole
family there.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.810
Aw.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.312
What he said.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.399
- We love you!
- You're not a baby hater.

20:34.483 --> 20:36.360
Oh.

20:36.443 --> 20:39.029
[instrumental music]

20:43.033 --> 20:46.453
Ah, now, this is love.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.498
Check out the hairs
on my back.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.708
I'd rather not.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.877
[music continues]

20:57.339 --> 20:59.716
