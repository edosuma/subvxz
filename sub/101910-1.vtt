01:12.865 --> 01:15.701
<i>Of all my childhood memories,</i>

01:15.735 --> 01:17.770
<i>there is one sound
I remember the most.</i>

01:17.803 --> 01:20.006
<i>¡Papá!</i>

01:52.538 --> 01:54.640
<i>But if you think
we were the typical</i>

01:54.674 --> 01:56.809
<i>father and son... think again.</i>

02:21.834 --> 02:23.035
- Oh!
- Ooh.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.641
<i>Dad and I were never
bored together</i>

02:29.674 --> 02:33.545
<i>because, to my dad,
life was a big game.</i>

02:38.017 --> 02:41.887
<i>And our favorite game
was solving Dad's riddles.</i>

03:37.376 --> 03:39.044
<i>And then it happened.</i>

03:54.959 --> 03:56.928
Hey.

04:41.873 --> 04:44.142
<i>¡Mijo!</i>

05:33.024 --> 05:34.993
Oh, Renato.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.232
First of all,
I want to thank you

06:14.265 --> 06:16.033
for doing this interview.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.801
Mr. Murguia, you have built

06:17.834 --> 06:20.037
one of the most successful
aviation companies

06:20.070 --> 06:21.905
here in your hometown
of San Miguel.

06:21.939 --> 06:24.975
How did you do it? What was
the key to your success?

06:25.008 --> 06:27.978
I learned early in life
that no one's gonna help you.

06:28.011 --> 06:29.247
You got to work your ass off.

06:29.280 --> 06:30.248
And, of course,
having a brilliant CEO

06:30.281 --> 06:32.250
by my side doesn't hurt.

06:32.283 --> 06:34.818
Ay, he's saying that because
you are here.

06:34.851 --> 06:36.787
- Yes, I am. I'm kidding.
- Thank you.

06:36.820 --> 06:38.188
She's great. She's the best.

06:38.223 --> 06:40.225
I was speaking with Perla
earlier, and she mentioned

06:40.258 --> 06:42.226
you'll be expanding
into the U.S. soon.

06:44.828 --> 06:46.964
Oh, no, I think
you misunderstood her.

06:46.997 --> 06:50.133
We have no plans of doing
business in the United States.

06:50.167 --> 06:52.903
Well, why wouldn't you want
to do business with the U.S.?

06:52.936 --> 06:54.938
Uh, so h-here's the thing.

06:54.972 --> 06:57.241
Wh-Why do you guys always think

06:57.274 --> 06:59.243
the United States is
the symbol of success? Hmm?

06:59.276 --> 07:01.812
Maybe now is
a good time to take

07:01.845 --> 07:03.213
- a tour of the facility.
- No, it's a good time

07:03.247 --> 07:04.948
- to discuss this.
- Yes.

07:04.982 --> 07:06.116
Let's talk about this,
because I think there's

07:06.149 --> 07:07.985
a big problem there, you know?

07:08.018 --> 07:10.020
You want to know what the real
problem with Americans is?

07:10.053 --> 07:11.922
They're entitled.
They're ignorant.

07:11.955 --> 07:13.223
They think Mexico is just

07:13.257 --> 07:14.992
a bunch of drug cartels
and Cancún.

07:15.025 --> 07:16.994
Why don't we talk
about the planes?

07:17.027 --> 07:18.228
They're idiots.
And you know what else?

07:18.262 --> 07:19.997
- They're fat.
- Now we're all fat?

07:20.030 --> 07:22.132
- No, he means full of life.
- No, I mean full of fat.

07:22.165 --> 07:24.001
Like, supersized, okay?

07:24.034 --> 07:25.570
- A-And you know what really annoys me?
- What?

07:25.603 --> 07:28.105
When you guys see
we are from another country,

07:28.138 --> 07:30.874
you just speak louder
and slower to us.

07:30.907 --> 07:32.843
Maybe you guys should learn
another language.

07:32.876 --> 07:34.378
You know what I mean, partner?

08:21.925 --> 08:22.893
Aw.

08:36.006 --> 08:37.441
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.447 --> 08:44.947
Emilio.

09:07.504 --> 09:08.871
Okay?

09:39.034 --> 09:41.003
Okay, um...

10:25.782 --> 10:27.550
Okay.

10:49.271 --> 10:51.373
- Hey.
- Hola.

10:53.642 --> 10:55.277
Okay.

10:58.113 --> 11:00.115
Hi. This is Renato Murguia.

11:00.149 --> 11:02.051
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:02.084 --> 11:03.352
Uh, this is Katherine.

11:03.385 --> 11:05.254
Hi, Katherine.
How can I help you?

11:05.287 --> 11:07.256
I'm your father's wife.

11:10.459 --> 11:12.595
I'm calling because...

11:12.628 --> 11:17.266
well, I know your relationship
with him is complicated,

11:17.299 --> 11:21.136
but you should know
your father's very ill.

11:23.272 --> 11:25.241
Are you still there?

11:25.274 --> 11:27.243
Yes.

11:27.276 --> 11:29.545
It would mean so much
to your dad

11:29.578 --> 11:34.316
if you could come see him
here in Chicago.

11:34.350 --> 11:37.553
Um... listen, not to be rude,

11:37.586 --> 11:40.222
but I haven't heard
from him in years,

11:40.256 --> 11:43.225
and to be honest with you, um,

11:43.259 --> 11:46.362
I don't even see your husband
as my father anymore, so...

11:46.395 --> 11:50.266
Renato, he really needs
to see you.

11:58.507 --> 12:01.277
<i>¿Mamá?</i>

12:09.150 --> 12:10.519
No. No...

13:31.967 --> 13:33.534
Hey.

13:58.426 --> 14:01.229
<i>Welcome to
the United States of America.</i>

14:02.697 --> 14:05.400
"Ree-nae-doe"?

14:07.568 --> 14:10.304
It's pronounced "Re-naht-o."

14:10.338 --> 14:13.241
Oh, your accent is adorable.

14:13.274 --> 14:16.277
Welcome to America, friend.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.212
Where you from?

14:18.246 --> 14:19.681
Uh, from Mexico.

14:19.714 --> 14:22.350
- Oh, Mexico.
- Yes.

14:22.383 --> 14:24.485
I love that Cancún.

14:24.519 --> 14:26.988
The zip-lining down there,
it's amazing.

14:27.022 --> 14:29.490
If I lived in Mexico,
I'd zip-line every day.

14:29.524 --> 14:31.759
- Oh, yeah?
- You do a lot of zip-lining down there?

14:31.793 --> 14:33.461
I-I... No, I don't zip-line.

14:33.494 --> 14:35.229
- What?
- Yeah.

14:35.263 --> 14:38.232
Why do you live in Mexico, then?

14:45.540 --> 14:48.009
Mmm.

14:48.042 --> 14:49.444
Boomerang!

14:49.477 --> 14:51.579
Hold on, hold on. Boomerang!

14:53.748 --> 14:55.349
I can do this.

14:55.383 --> 14:56.684
Boomerang!
There we go. Hey.

14:56.718 --> 14:58.286
What's up, guys?
Asher is back.

14:58.319 --> 14:59.687
I'm live here
at the Boiler Monkey,

14:59.721 --> 15:02.623
and we're checking out
all these delish treats.

15:02.657 --> 15:04.726
But who is this?

15:04.759 --> 15:06.360
What's your name, partner?

15:06.394 --> 15:08.296
Please just don't film me.

15:08.329 --> 15:09.864
Oh, that's a cool accent, man.
Where you from?

15:09.897 --> 15:11.766
- From Mexico.
- Mexico?

15:11.799 --> 15:13.701
- Yes.
- Oh, that's dangerous. Is that why you fled here?

15:13.735 --> 15:15.436
I didn't flee here.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.304
Could you please take
that thing out my face?

15:17.338 --> 15:19.440
Yeah, okay,
you don't... Be calm, man.

15:19.474 --> 15:21.375
- I am calm.
- You don't need to be tense anymore.

15:21.409 --> 15:23.276
You're safe now.
You're in America.

15:23.310 --> 15:24.479
Next customer.

15:24.512 --> 15:25.513
All right.

15:26.514 --> 15:27.615
Hey there, "Beat-rice."

15:27.648 --> 15:28.816
It's Beatrice.

15:28.850 --> 15:31.552
Sure.

15:31.586 --> 15:33.755
I checked in on Yelp, so that
means that if I buy a coffee

15:33.788 --> 15:35.456
I can get anything else
for free, right?

15:35.490 --> 15:36.691
You can get another coffee
for free.

15:36.724 --> 15:38.826
Damn.

15:38.860 --> 15:40.695
Those doughnuts
look good, though.

15:41.729 --> 15:43.498
- What do you think?
- Just order.

15:43.531 --> 15:45.066
Okay. You know what?
I'll just have the two coffees,

15:45.099 --> 15:47.367
- and make one of them with almond milk.
- Okay.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.870
- That comes to $1.87.
- Great.

15:48.903 --> 15:51.072
Amigo, spot me two bucks?

15:51.105 --> 15:52.907
- What?
- Spot me two bucks?

15:52.940 --> 15:55.475
- No.
- You don't have two bucks?

15:55.509 --> 15:57.377
I do have two bucks, but I'm
not giving you any money.

15:57.410 --> 15:59.379
Ooh, what's your deal, man?
You know I'm good for it.

15:59.412 --> 16:00.882
- What's my deal? You don't carry any money on you?
- Yeah.

16:00.915 --> 16:03.316
Not even a-a credit card?

16:03.350 --> 16:04.819
No, all my liquid's tied up
in investments.

16:04.852 --> 16:06.888
Listen, if you can't afford
something, you can't buy it,

16:06.921 --> 16:09.456
so please move.

16:09.489 --> 16:11.692
Hi. I'm gonna have
a large coffee, please.

16:11.726 --> 16:13.761
Man, I-I didn't even
want the wall.

16:15.797 --> 16:17.664
You know what? I'm gonna buy

16:17.698 --> 16:19.499
all of these doughnuts,
and then I want you

16:19.533 --> 16:20.902
to throw them in the trash.

16:22.435 --> 16:24.471
You're-you're a monster.

16:24.504 --> 16:26.774
Yeah.
You can keep the change.

16:28.810 --> 16:30.510
Excuse me.

16:39.854 --> 16:41.388
Hi.

16:41.421 --> 16:43.657
I'm here to see Flavio Murguia.

16:43.690 --> 16:45.458
Renato?

16:50.998 --> 16:53.667
Hi. I'm Katherine.

16:53.700 --> 16:55.402
Thank you so much for coming.

16:58.605 --> 17:01.608
It's gonna mean so much
to your dad.

17:01.641 --> 17:03.777
He's been waiting for you.

17:16.690 --> 17:18.925
- I'll leave the two of you alone.
- Yes.

17:45.785 --> 17:47.520
Renato.

17:48.655 --> 17:51.524
Hola.

18:27.661 --> 18:30.497
Okay. Okay. Um...

18:31.731 --> 18:34.801
I want you to remember
this name,

18:34.834 --> 18:37.804
because it's gonna clear
a lot of things in your life.

18:39.572 --> 18:41.574
Eloise.

18:41.608 --> 18:43.977
It's all about Eloise.

18:46.913 --> 18:48.248
So, I was at the coffee shop,

18:48.281 --> 18:49.849
but they were all out
of coffee, so...

18:49.883 --> 18:51.517
- Are-are you following me?
- What are you doing here?

18:51.550 --> 18:53.053
- No. Why would I...
- What is wrong with you?

18:53.086 --> 18:53.820
- Are you following me?
- Dad, is-is this guy bothering you?

18:53.853 --> 18:55.755
Dad?

18:55.789 --> 18:59.726
Renato, meet your brother Asher.

19:01.527 --> 19:03.562
What? What do you...

19:03.595 --> 19:04.798
Wh-What do you mean, "brother"?
Th...

19:04.831 --> 19:06.565
This-this guy's a bully.
He is not nice.

19:06.598 --> 19:08.567
Please just-just...
just leave us for a second.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.036
No, no, why do I have to...
I'm not going.

19:10.070 --> 19:11.738
- Please just leave us. Leave.
- Dad, do I have to go?

19:11.771 --> 19:13.539
Please, I need you both
to hear this.

19:13.572 --> 19:15.607
Yeah.

19:16.642 --> 19:18.610
Look in my robe, my son.

19:27.653 --> 19:29.889
Ay, Renato.

19:29.923 --> 19:34.560
I wish I could just sit here
and explain everything to you,

19:34.593 --> 19:36.997
but they would just be words.

19:37.030 --> 19:39.732
You wouldn't understand.

19:39.765 --> 19:43.569
Certain things have to be seen
from a different perspective.

19:43.602 --> 19:46.039
Ah, I don't care about
your perspective at all.

19:46.072 --> 19:47.740
I just want to know
what happened.

19:47.773 --> 19:49.742
And you will.

19:49.775 --> 19:52.611
I promise you.

19:52.644 --> 19:57.716
All you need to do
is deliver this envelope.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.785
No.

19:59.818 --> 20:02.755
I'm not playing any of your...
of your games.

20:02.788 --> 20:04.023
If you don't want to tell me

20:04.057 --> 20:05.624
what happened,
I-I'm gonna leave.

20:05.657 --> 20:08.627
No. No, no, Renato.

20:08.660 --> 20:12.631
I know you hate me,
a-and I don't blame you,

20:12.664 --> 20:17.002
but I promise you
it will all make sense.

20:17.036 --> 20:19.004
I just need both of you
to promise me

20:19.038 --> 20:20.639
that you will deliver this.

20:20.672 --> 20:21.907
Why would I promise you
anything?

20:21.940 --> 20:23.776
I promise you, Dad.

20:24.810 --> 20:26.078
Renato, please.

20:26.111 --> 20:28.580
Please, there is so much
I want to tell you.

20:28.614 --> 20:30.682
Oh...

20:30.716 --> 20:33.052
I-I think...
I think I know enough.

20:33.085 --> 20:35.921
No. No, <i>mijo.</i>

20:36.922 --> 20:38.624
Goodbye, Flavio.

20:38.657 --> 20:40.360
<i>Por favor.</i>

20:40.393 --> 20:43.629
Renato, <i>mijo.</i>

20:52.704 --> 20:54.606
<i>¡Papá!</i>

21:05.184 --> 21:07.086
<i>Bueno.</i>

21:08.421 --> 21:10.789
Oh. Hi.

21:41.253 --> 21:42.955
Did you know Frank?

21:44.223 --> 21:45.991
- Sorry. Who?
- Frank.

21:46.024 --> 21:48.961
Katherine's husband.
Did you know him?

21:51.029 --> 21:53.132
No, I guess I didn't.

21:53.165 --> 21:56.201
Oh, he was a great man.

21:56.235 --> 21:58.904
So generous and caring, and...

21:58.937 --> 22:01.006
and he loved his family so much.

22:01.039 --> 22:02.640
Yeah.

22:04.276 --> 22:07.212
Uh, I'm sorry. I need to go.

22:09.982 --> 22:11.150
Hey.

22:12.251 --> 22:14.685
You know, I've been thinking
a lot about it,

22:14.719 --> 22:17.688
and I just want to let you know
I'm not mad at you anymore

22:17.722 --> 22:20.225
and I'm gonna give you
a second chance.

22:20.259 --> 22:23.095
Are you freaking kidding me
right now?

22:23.128 --> 22:25.830
- What? I'm apologizing here.
- Oh, yeah?

22:25.863 --> 22:28.033
Look, I guess it's kind of cool
I have a brother.

22:28.066 --> 22:29.301
Maybe I'll come down
to Mexico sometime

22:29.334 --> 22:30.969
and we can check out
these zip lines

22:31.003 --> 22:32.070
you guys keep bragging about.

22:32.104 --> 22:34.173
Shut up.

22:34.206 --> 22:36.008
I don't like you, okay?

22:36.041 --> 22:37.875
I don't want to be close to you.

22:37.909 --> 22:41.079
You're not my brother, so
please just stay away from me.

22:43.915 --> 22:46.218
- What are you doing, man?
- Oh, my God.

22:46.251 --> 22:48.220
We got to do this thing for Dad.

22:48.253 --> 22:50.322
Don't you even want to know
what the letter says?

22:50.355 --> 22:52.690
- No, I don't.
- I do.

22:55.793 --> 22:57.895
"My dear sons...

22:57.929 --> 23:00.165
"I know you have
many unanswered questions,

23:00.199 --> 23:01.999
"so you must go see
my friend Evaristo.

23:02.033 --> 23:04.303
"He will provide you with
the answers you are seeking.

23:04.336 --> 23:06.737
He will lead you to Eloise."

23:06.771 --> 23:08.773
Eloise. Holy shit, dude.
Do you think we have a sister?

23:08.806 --> 23:10.242
I really don't care.

23:10.275 --> 23:11.943
Hey, there's another envelope
in here. It's like a...

23:11.976 --> 23:13.811
It's like a clue.
I don't know if you know this,

23:13.844 --> 23:15.079
but Dad loved riddles.

23:15.112 --> 23:17.216
- Yeah.
- Hey!

23:18.149 --> 23:19.951
- Wait. Come on, man.
- "Ren-a-doo"?

23:19.984 --> 23:21.953
We're supposed to do this
together as brothers.

23:21.986 --> 23:23.522
You promised Dad
that we would do this.

23:23.555 --> 23:25.756
- No, I didn't promise him anything, okay?
- Yes.

23:25.790 --> 23:28.125
And do you really think
I want to go on a road trip

23:28.159 --> 23:31.796
with some stupid,
entitled shithead like you?

23:32.797 --> 23:34.899
Is this a trick question?

23:36.234 --> 23:38.970
Come on!

23:39.003 --> 23:40.304
What's your problem, man?

23:42.306 --> 23:43.975
<i>Bueno.</i>

24:28.085 --> 24:29.887
Okay.

24:38.429 --> 24:40.197
Come back to apologize?

24:40.231 --> 24:42.867
Pick me up tomorrow,
7:00 a.m., my hotel.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.402
Hell yeah. Road trip.

24:44.435 --> 24:47.038
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No road trip.

24:47.071 --> 24:48.306
Day trip, okay?

24:48.339 --> 24:50.875
7:00 a.m., my hotel, sharp.
You got it?

24:50.908 --> 24:52.143
- I got it.
- You got it?

24:52.176 --> 24:53.311
I got it. 7:00 a.m.

24:53.344 --> 24:55.212
- Jesus.
- Let's go.

25:10.494 --> 25:12.263
Yeah!

25:17.368 --> 25:19.370
Hey, hey.
What's up, <i>mi amigo?</i>

25:19.403 --> 25:21.939
- We said 7:00.
- I-I thought we said 8:00.

25:21.972 --> 25:23.140
No, I said 7:00.

25:23.174 --> 25:24.874
It must be the language barrier.

25:24.908 --> 25:26.843
I don't know.

25:36.354 --> 25:37.921
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

25:37.954 --> 25:39.190
You're wondering what those

25:39.223 --> 25:40.990
huge jugs of fuel are
back there, huh?

25:41.991 --> 25:44.128
They're carbon-based
alternative fuel.

25:44.161 --> 25:45.962
Okay. I'm assuming ethanol?

25:45.995 --> 25:47.931
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:47.964 --> 25:50.434
Hey, man, are you, like, smart?

25:50.468 --> 25:52.969
- I'm an engineer.
- Dude!

25:53.002 --> 25:54.305
Dad was an engineer.

25:54.338 --> 25:55.972
Did you know that?

25:56.005 --> 25:57.408
Yeah, man.

25:57.441 --> 25:59.943
Dad wanted me to be
an engineer, but I was like,

25:59.976 --> 26:01.679
"Yeah, no, thanks.
I'm not a loser."

26:01.712 --> 26:03.247
- Oh.
- I'm-I'm an ideas guy.

26:03.280 --> 26:05.316
- Oh, yeah? Yeah.
- You know what I mean? Yeah.

26:05.349 --> 26:06.983
I see.

26:07.016 --> 26:08.519
You're one of these
lazy Americans, right?

26:08.552 --> 26:11.121
No, I'm not... I'm not lazy.
I'm a... I'm a thoughts guy.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.456
Yeah, I can see. I can see.

26:12.490 --> 26:15.158
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:15.191 --> 26:17.328
- Do you have a job?
- What do you mean?

26:17.361 --> 26:19.262
I mean, do you have a job?
What do you do?

26:19.296 --> 26:20.398
I'm a brand ambassador.

26:20.431 --> 26:22.031
That's bullshit.

26:22.065 --> 26:23.933
Have you ever had a real job

26:23.967 --> 26:25.935
where someone actually paid you
for something?

26:25.969 --> 26:27.505
- Yeah, I've had a real job.
- Yeah? What?

26:27.538 --> 26:30.073
Yeah. I was a product
distribution specialist.

26:31.074 --> 26:33.377
What the hell is that?
What did you distribute?

26:33.411 --> 26:34.712
Hmm?

26:34.745 --> 26:36.146
Lots of stuff, man.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.281
Trip Dips, Awesome Blossoms,

26:38.314 --> 26:41.251
baby backs, ranch.
Lot of ranch.

26:41.284 --> 26:42.520
Are you talking about Chili's?

26:42.553 --> 26:44.287
Yeah.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.457
- You were a waiter at Chili's?
- Yeah.

26:46.490 --> 26:48.726
- Cool, huh?
- And what happened to that job?

26:48.759 --> 26:50.427
They had no vision.

26:50.460 --> 26:52.362
Oh, Chili's had no vision? Wow.

26:52.395 --> 26:54.164
- Yeah, they couldn't keep up, man.
- Yeah, that's great. Okay.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.965
It wasn't the right environment
for someone like me,

26:55.999 --> 26:57.167
with my talent and my ideas.
You know what I'm saying.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.035
- Can I ask you a huge favor?
- Yeah.

26:59.068 --> 27:00.437
Shut up! Okay?

27:00.470 --> 27:02.272
I don't want to
get to know you at all.

27:02.305 --> 27:04.274
I don't care about
your likes or dislikes

27:04.307 --> 27:06.142
- or your favorite Netflix show.
- <i>Umbrella Academy.</i>

27:06.176 --> 27:07.745
I don't care!

27:07.778 --> 27:10.513
I really enjoy the silence,
so please just shut up.

27:13.483 --> 27:15.185
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

27:15.218 --> 27:18.288
Do not wake me up
until we get there.

27:38.475 --> 27:41.211
Start the car, dude!

27:41.244 --> 27:42.512
Start the car! Start the car!

27:42.545 --> 27:44.113
Get that boy!

27:44.147 --> 27:45.415
- Get back here!
- Yeah, shoot! Shoot!

27:45.448 --> 27:47.217
What the...

27:47.250 --> 27:48.785
Get back here with that goat!

27:50.053 --> 27:51.354
Get him! Get him!

27:51.387 --> 27:53.556
- What the hell?!
- Pick it up. Pick it up.

27:55.391 --> 27:57.260
What are you doing? Start the car, man!

27:57.293 --> 27:58.795
- We got to get out of here!
- Oh, my God!

28:00.230 --> 28:02.031
- It's okay.
- Oh, my God!

28:02.065 --> 28:04.100
Holy shit!

28:04.133 --> 28:05.502
Jesus!

28:07.504 --> 28:09.539
Son of a bitch!

28:09.572 --> 28:11.441
- What the hell was that?!
- I know.

28:11.474 --> 28:14.244
I saved you, man. I've never
saved someone's life before.

28:14.277 --> 28:15.478
What the hell
were you doing there?!

28:15.512 --> 28:17.280
- I was taking the tour.
- What?!

28:17.313 --> 28:19.249
I saw this little guy,
and he was looking at me like,

28:19.282 --> 28:20.650
"Asher, you got to get me
out of here, man."

28:20.683 --> 28:22.285
You were taking a tour?

28:22.318 --> 28:23.486
- Why were you taking a tour?
- I saw the sign.

28:23.520 --> 28:26.122
"World-famous goat farm."

28:28.157 --> 28:29.626
Get it out of the car.

28:29.659 --> 28:31.194
What are you talking about?

28:31.227 --> 28:32.529
- Get it out of the car!
- What? No.

28:32.562 --> 28:34.264
Get it out of the car now!

28:34.297 --> 28:35.431
No.

28:35.465 --> 28:36.599
Oh, no? Okay.

28:36.633 --> 28:39.269
Hey! Hey!

28:39.302 --> 28:40.670
What are you doing, man?

28:40.703 --> 28:42.305
What are you doing?
You're-you're scaring him.

28:42.338 --> 28:44.139
- Get it out of the car.
- No, I'm not...

28:44.173 --> 28:45.275
- Get it out of the car now!
- What's your problem, man?

28:45.308 --> 28:46.209
- Out! Get it out!
- You get out.

28:46.242 --> 28:47.410
Get it out!

28:49.445 --> 28:51.146
- What the hell, man?
- Bitch!

28:51.179 --> 28:52.448
Get off me!

28:56.184 --> 28:57.320
Who are you?!

28:57.353 --> 28:59.322
What do you mean, man?

28:59.355 --> 29:01.357
I'm your brother.

29:06.261 --> 29:08.196
Wait a minute.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.232
300 miles?

29:10.265 --> 29:13.302
When we left, it was 240 miles.

29:13.336 --> 29:14.537
Yeah, so?

29:14.571 --> 29:17.205
So, how are we
even farther away?!

29:17.239 --> 29:20.208
- I told you, I saw the sign.
- Oh, my God!

29:20.242 --> 29:21.711
Where else are you gonna see
goats roaming around freely?

29:21.744 --> 29:23.479
I don't know. All of Mexico!

29:23.513 --> 29:26.683
Hey. Stop bragging
about Mexico, okay?

29:26.716 --> 29:29.217
I get it...
it's a super cool place.

29:29.251 --> 29:30.385
Now, get in the car!

29:33.623 --> 29:35.324
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

29:35.357 --> 29:37.459
It's okay. Brothers fight.
Brothers fight.

29:37.493 --> 29:40.228
It's okay.
Brothers fight. I know.

29:48.571 --> 29:51.506
You coming or what, Bubba?

30:00.182 --> 30:02.217
- Maybe you shouldn't take any more naps.
- Just drive.

30:41.790 --> 30:43.492
<i>So, who is this Evaristo guy?</i>

30:43.525 --> 30:45.227
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>

30:49.431 --> 30:51.333
Where are we?
What is this place?

30:51.366 --> 30:53.468
I think this is
my dad's factory.

30:53.502 --> 30:54.971
Oh, you think it is?

30:55.004 --> 30:56.772
Yeah, I think
he used to run this place.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.542
I'm glad you know him so well.

31:02.411 --> 31:03.779
Hey, no, dude,
that's for Evaristo.

31:03.812 --> 31:05.313
Shut up.

31:08.316 --> 31:10.686
- What the hell is this?
- Huh.

31:10.719 --> 31:12.454
Maybe it's the key to his heart.

31:13.522 --> 31:15.223
What?

31:16.591 --> 31:18.393
Señor Renato, come on.

31:18.427 --> 31:20.796
Come on, Señor Renato.
Come on.

31:20.829 --> 31:22.531
What?

31:22.564 --> 31:24.566
I named him after you
so you guys would bond.

31:24.599 --> 31:26.702
Do not call him that, okay?

31:28.737 --> 31:31.306
Renatito. Renatito.

31:31.339 --> 31:33.008
Yes, that a boy.

31:33.041 --> 31:35.577
So, what are you planning
on doing with Bambi here, huh?

31:35.610 --> 31:37.446
What are you talking about?

31:37.479 --> 31:39.581
He's family now, man, and he
needs to feel close to you.

31:39.614 --> 31:41.550
You need to show him
that you care about him.

31:41.583 --> 31:42.784
I do not care about him.

31:42.818 --> 31:44.419
Dude.

31:44.453 --> 31:45.854
He can hear you, man.

31:45.887 --> 31:47.856
- Just put him in the car.
- No.

31:47.889 --> 31:49.691
Put him in the car now!

31:49.725 --> 31:51.460
Engineering, line two.

31:51.493 --> 31:53.395
What does this factory make,
anyway?

31:53.428 --> 31:56.298
- High-end remote controls.
- Oh, of course.

31:56.331 --> 31:58.734
God forbid you guys get off
your couch to turn on the TV.

31:58.767 --> 32:00.569
And then you wonder why
you're all fat-asses.

32:00.602 --> 32:02.871
- I'm not a fat-ass.
- You will be.

32:02.904 --> 32:04.706
I don't think those are
the remotes they make.

32:04.740 --> 32:06.708
Oh, well, what kind, then?

32:06.742 --> 32:09.611
Testing. Two, three, five.

32:27.394 --> 32:29.263
How do you not know about this?

32:30.397 --> 32:32.567
Dad tried to get me down here.
It's just...

32:32.601 --> 32:34.870
- It's not my jam.
- Not your jam?

32:35.871 --> 32:37.672
What kid doesn't love
remote-control airplanes?

32:37.706 --> 32:39.373
I don't know.

32:39.406 --> 32:40.709
But Dad was huge into airplanes.

32:40.742 --> 32:42.510
He loved them, man.

32:42.543 --> 32:44.311
He bought me a remote-control
plane once, you know?

32:44.345 --> 32:45.747
And he tried to make it
our thing, but I wasn't...

32:45.781 --> 32:47.581
It was our thing. I would have
killed to have this.

32:47.616 --> 32:49.785
- Okay, well, go buy one.
- You entitled little...

32:49.818 --> 32:51.820
I'm not entitled, dick. Ow!

32:51.853 --> 32:52.888
- Stupid...
- I'm not entitled.

32:52.921 --> 32:54.656
You guys okay?

32:54.689 --> 32:56.524
- Yes, we're-we're fine.
- Yeah, we're-we're cool.

32:56.557 --> 32:58.592
You must be here for Evaristo.

33:00.461 --> 33:01.696
He's been waiting for you.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.765
He's across the street.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.869
Ow!

33:13.674 --> 33:15.476
"Ja-lis-co."

33:15.509 --> 33:16.677
It's "Ha-lease-co."

33:16.710 --> 33:18.947
It's "Ja-lis-co."
There's no "H."

33:24.685 --> 33:26.587
How you doing?

33:28.522 --> 33:30.357
Oh, dude.

33:30.391 --> 33:31.725
I could smoke those guys.

33:31.759 --> 33:33.761
Just try to behave, okay?

33:35.830 --> 33:37.531
Hey. Got any citrusy brews?

34:06.727 --> 34:09.663
That son of a gun.

34:09.697 --> 34:12.366
Sit down.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.836
To Flavio Murguia.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.404
A great man.

34:17.438 --> 34:19.006
Listen, Flavio sent us
all the way here

34:19.039 --> 34:20.407
to get some answers, so...

34:20.441 --> 34:22.877
You were always a fiery kid.

34:22.910 --> 34:24.612
Do... do I know you?

34:24.645 --> 34:25.913
No, but I know you.

34:30.584 --> 34:32.720
That was us in San Miguel.

34:32.753 --> 34:34.722
When the economy collapsed,

34:34.755 --> 34:36.657
my cousin called us
about jobs here.

34:36.690 --> 34:39.493
So, you were the one
who convinced him to come here.

34:39.526 --> 34:41.996
No. Look, your dad tried

34:42.029 --> 34:44.765
to stay with you
as long as he could,

34:44.798 --> 34:47.735
but when there were
no jobs left,

34:47.768 --> 34:51.205
Flavio no longer had a choice.

34:51.238 --> 34:52.940
And saying goodbye to you was

34:52.973 --> 34:55.442
the hardest thing
he ever had to do.

35:18.766 --> 35:20.634
<i>See, coming to America,</i>

35:20.668 --> 35:22.236
<i>we didn't have many choices:</i>

35:22.269 --> 35:24.838
<i>picking fruit
or working in the factories.</i>

35:24.872 --> 35:28.642
<i>Back home, your dad was
a skilled engineer,</i>

35:28.676 --> 35:31.946
<i>but that didn't matter here.</i>

35:31.979 --> 35:33.881
Let's go! Let's go!

35:33.914 --> 35:36.549
<i>They just wanted
cheap foreign labor.</i>

35:36.582 --> 35:40.486
<i>People willing to work
longer hours for half the pay.</i>

35:45.591 --> 35:48.528
<i>And to work in conditions</i>

35:48.561 --> 35:51.065
<i>that no one else would.</i>

36:04.610 --> 36:06.612
- <i>¿Papá?</i>
- <i>Mijo.</i>

36:42.882 --> 36:44.884
<i>Because he knew
he would have to</i>

36:44.917 --> 36:48.055
<i>work many years to earn enough
to be able to come back home.</i>

36:48.088 --> 36:51.991
<i>He knew he had to find
a faster way.</i>

36:52.025 --> 36:54.961
<i>A faster way to earn money.</i>

36:54.994 --> 36:59.599
<i>He knew what the factory was
making would soon be obsolete.</i>

37:00.900 --> 37:02.835
<i>So he took a chance.</i>

37:05.038 --> 37:07.740
<i>It was a big risk
if he got caught.</i>

37:13.746 --> 37:16.616
<i>But she was different
than the others.</i>

37:17.750 --> 37:21.621
<i>She believed great ideas
could come from anyone.</i>

37:22.155 --> 37:23.723
Hey, where are you going?

37:23.756 --> 37:25.091
I got to... I got to go
to the bathroom.

37:25.124 --> 37:26.592
Relax.

37:26.626 --> 37:29.929
So, what happened next?

37:29.962 --> 37:32.932
<i>Your father
finally found an ally,</i>

37:32.965 --> 37:36.936
<i>and soon, they found an ally
in each other.</i>

37:38.104 --> 37:40.173
<i>Together, they created</i>

37:40.206 --> 37:43.609
<i>a whole new product
for the company.</i>

37:44.977 --> 37:47.914
<i>After years of struggling,</i>

37:47.947 --> 37:52.618
<i>Flavio would soon be able
to come back home.</i>

37:52.652 --> 37:54.754
<i>And to celebrate their success,</i>

37:54.787 --> 37:59.125
<i>he took her to the one place
where he felt safe and welcome.</i>

38:17.910 --> 38:20.179
<i>But he knew
he made a grave mistake.</i>

38:24.784 --> 38:26.853
<i>If he had stayed here
a little bit longer,</i>

38:26.886 --> 38:29.822
<i>he could have saved
all the money he needed.</i>

38:30.790 --> 38:33.793
<i>But that didn't matter
to him anymore.</i>

38:37.230 --> 38:40.199
<i>The only thing
that mattered to him</i>

38:40.233 --> 38:43.269
<i>was getting back to you.</i>

38:43.302 --> 38:46.439
Then what happened?
He never came back.

38:46.472 --> 38:48.241
That's all I can tell you.

38:48.274 --> 38:50.843
Oh, come on, please.
I-I-I came all the way here.

38:50.877 --> 38:53.745
- Please.
- But your father did say...

38:54.313 --> 38:55.915
...that you would figure it out.

39:08.860 --> 39:11.230
All right, my brothers,
$500 I sink this shot...

39:11.264 --> 39:12.932
...right now.

39:16.269 --> 39:18.137
Come on, please.
Evaristo, <i>por favor,</i>

39:18.171 --> 39:21.140
just-just tell me,
who is this Eloise?

39:21.174 --> 39:26.045
Eloise is everything
you're looking for.

39:28.980 --> 39:30.283
Hey, dude.
Help me. Help me.

39:30.316 --> 39:33.919
Aah! Ah, shit!

39:33.952 --> 39:36.788
Hey!

39:36.821 --> 39:38.491
- Hey, what happened?
- I was hot. I couldn't miss.

39:38.524 --> 39:40.159
- Yeah, well, you did, right?
- No, they're just overreacting.

39:40.193 --> 39:42.161
Just spot me $500.
Double or nothing.

39:42.195 --> 39:43.329
I'll win it back right now.

39:43.362 --> 39:44.930
- What? Give me the keys.
- For what?

39:44.963 --> 39:47.098
I left the wallet in...
Give me the keys.

39:47.133 --> 39:48.267
See ya.

39:54.906 --> 39:56.074
Oh...

40:15.260 --> 40:16.761
Go! Go!

40:16.795 --> 40:18.230
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:21.199 --> 40:23.101
You're welcome.

40:23.134 --> 40:26.104
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Dude, I saved you 500 bucks.

40:26.137 --> 40:27.872
I should kill you!
You're so...

40:27.906 --> 40:29.307
- s-stupid!
- Hey! Easy!

40:31.876 --> 40:33.111
What is wrong with you?

40:33.144 --> 40:34.312
What-what do you mean?

40:34.346 --> 40:35.947
What is wrong with you?!
You're a nutcase!

40:35.981 --> 40:38.016
No, I'm not.

40:40.819 --> 40:42.821
There's nothing wrong with me.

40:42.854 --> 40:45.156
Yeah, okay. Whatever.

40:49.294 --> 40:52.130
Well, did you find out
who Eloise is?

40:52.163 --> 40:54.032
Don't talk to me.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.335
<i>Look, I'm sorry, man.</i>

40:57.369 --> 41:00.171
<i>I just get excited, you know?</i>

41:13.618 --> 41:16.288
Yo! They got Animal Planet!

41:16.321 --> 41:18.890
Renatito's loving this shit!

42:13.345 --> 42:16.281
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

42:16.314 --> 42:18.083
It'll be okay.

42:19.084 --> 42:20.318
Hey.

42:22.387 --> 42:24.988
What's up?

42:25.022 --> 42:28.093
Um... listen, um...

42:28.126 --> 42:29.394
you're a good guy, okay?

42:29.427 --> 42:31.396
You have some issues,
of course, but...

42:31.429 --> 42:32.963
I already know
what you're gonna say.

42:32.996 --> 42:35.065
Oh. Really?

42:35.099 --> 42:36.368
What am I gonna say?

42:44.509 --> 42:48.213
Listen, I...
I didn't mean what I said.

42:48.246 --> 42:50.415
Don't give up on me, man.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.251
What do you mean?

42:53.284 --> 42:55.286
Everybody always gives up on me.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.122
It's exactly what Dad did,
and now you're doing it, too?

42:59.189 --> 43:00.692
Come on, man, we're brothers.

43:00.725 --> 43:02.427
No, we're not brothers, okay?

43:02.460 --> 43:04.228
I... That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

43:04.261 --> 43:05.996
This is a very personal trip
for me,

43:06.029 --> 43:07.998
- and I cannot do it with you, man.
- Please.

43:08.031 --> 43:11.301
- Like...
- I promise, I won't annoy you anymore, okay?

43:11.335 --> 43:13.405
I won't be weird. I promise.

43:13.438 --> 43:15.373
Let me prove to you
that I can do this.

43:15.407 --> 43:18.108
Whatever... whatever brother
you want me to be,

43:18.142 --> 43:20.478
that's the brother
I'm gonna be for you.

43:21.479 --> 43:23.981
Just...

43:24.014 --> 43:26.150
don't ditch me, man.

43:30.320 --> 43:31.989
Okay.

43:33.157 --> 43:35.259
Okay, let's see what's
the next stop on the trip.

43:35.292 --> 43:36.427
Yes!

43:36.460 --> 43:37.995
You're not gonna
regret this, man.

43:38.028 --> 43:39.363
This doesn't mean
I like you now.

43:39.396 --> 43:40.532
- Okay?
- No, no, I know.

43:42.332 --> 43:45.436
Okay. Okay.

43:45.469 --> 43:47.237
"Mr. B."

43:51.041 --> 43:53.177
What is this?
It's a claim ticket.

43:53.210 --> 43:55.212
Yeah, for a pawnshop.

43:57.014 --> 43:58.982
I cannot even look at you
like that.

43:59.016 --> 44:01.318
- Oh. Sorry.
- Do not, okay?

44:01.351 --> 44:03.220
Jesus.

44:03.253 --> 44:05.055
Okay, it says:

44:05.088 --> 44:07.524
"P.S. I put all my effort
into going home."

44:07.558 --> 44:09.359
- Yes.
- "I made it okay."

44:10.527 --> 44:12.262
"I made it okay."
"I made it okay."

44:12.296 --> 44:15.098
"I-I put all my effort
in-into going home.

44:15.132 --> 44:16.300
I made it okay."

44:16.333 --> 44:18.001
Bam!

44:18.035 --> 44:21.205
There are six
Mr. B's Pawnshops in America.

44:21.238 --> 44:23.073
We're just gonna have to go
to every single one of them.

44:23.106 --> 44:24.575
- That's your plan?
- Yes.

44:24.608 --> 44:25.576
Okay.

44:25.609 --> 44:27.177
Uh, "I made it okay."

44:27.211 --> 44:29.480
Maybe... maybe that's
an abbreviation.

44:29.513 --> 44:31.048
"OK."

44:31.081 --> 44:32.349
O-Oklahoma.

44:32.382 --> 44:34.518
Yes!
Google pawnshops in Oklahoma.

44:36.487 --> 44:39.156
- What?
- There's a Mr. B's Pawnshop

44:39.189 --> 44:40.290
in Oklahoma City.

44:40.324 --> 44:42.125
I knew it.

44:50.567 --> 44:54.404
So, who's this Emilio guy?

44:56.406 --> 44:57.808
Anger management therapist?

44:57.841 --> 44:59.810
He's ten, okay?

44:59.843 --> 45:01.578
He's...

45:01.612 --> 45:03.313
He's my fiancée's son.

45:05.415 --> 45:06.583
What?

45:06.617 --> 45:08.819
What? What's so funny?

45:08.852 --> 45:10.654
You're gonna be a father?

45:10.687 --> 45:12.054
Yeah. So?

45:13.624 --> 45:15.526
- What?
- Oh, my God, man.

45:15.559 --> 45:17.160
You're gonna be
the worst father.

45:17.194 --> 45:19.229
You don't know me, okay?
Shut up.

45:19.263 --> 45:21.063
I know that
you're kind of a dick

45:21.097 --> 45:22.299
and you have zero empathy.

45:22.332 --> 45:24.167
I have lots of empathy, okay?

45:24.201 --> 45:25.335
All right, let's play a game.

45:25.369 --> 45:26.537
No, I don't want to play
any games.

45:26.570 --> 45:28.137
Yeah, we're gonna play a game.
Come on.

45:28.171 --> 45:29.406
I'm Emilio,
and I'm having trouble

45:29.439 --> 45:31.173
with the kids at school.

45:31.208 --> 45:33.544
Dad, they keep picking on me
and calling me names.

45:33.577 --> 45:35.144
What do I do?

45:35.177 --> 45:36.547
This is very...
I'm not playing this.

45:36.580 --> 45:38.315
This is stupid.

45:38.348 --> 45:40.250
I prefer your horrible music
to this.

45:43.353 --> 45:45.422
Okay, okay. Whatever. Ah.

45:45.455 --> 45:48.458
Listen, Emilio. If you don't
want people to pick on you,

45:48.492 --> 45:51.695
then just don't give them
a reason to make fun of you.

45:51.728 --> 45:53.162
There you go.

45:53.195 --> 45:55.164
- Wow. Goose bumps.
- Yeah.

45:55.197 --> 45:56.333
Goose bumps from the compassion.

45:56.366 --> 45:57.501
- Whatever.
- That was loving, man.

45:57.534 --> 45:58.869
- You have no idea.
- That was...

45:58.902 --> 46:00.303
Wha-What do you know?
What do you know

46:00.336 --> 46:02.104
about parenthood, man?
You have no idea.

46:02.138 --> 46:03.105
- I'm gonna bring out the big guns.
- Yeah, whatever.

46:04.140 --> 46:06.510
What the hell is that?
Why do you have a puppet?

46:06.543 --> 46:08.144
- You don't?
- No, I don't.

46:08.177 --> 46:09.446
I'm not seven, okay?

46:09.479 --> 46:10.714
Okay, well, you should get one.

46:10.747 --> 46:11.882
It really helps
externalize emotions.

46:11.915 --> 46:13.149
Oh, yeah? Who told you that?

46:13.182 --> 46:14.317
Rebecca, my online therapist.

46:14.350 --> 46:15.318
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

46:15.351 --> 46:16.453
Is it working for you?

46:16.486 --> 46:17.588
Well, just listen, okay?

46:17.621 --> 46:19.221
This is Emilio, all right?

46:19.255 --> 46:21.123
<i>Papá.</i>

46:21.157 --> 46:23.493
Math is super hard.
I never get the answers right,

46:23.527 --> 46:25.394
and the kids call me <i>estúpido.</i>

46:25.428 --> 46:27.296
So, what, my-my kid
is Russian now?

46:27.330 --> 46:29.098
Come on. Take care of him.

46:33.770 --> 46:35.672
Okay, listen, Emilio.

46:35.706 --> 46:37.473
- No, no, to the puppet.
- Okay, listen, Emilio.

46:37.506 --> 46:39.508
The only reason
kids are making fun of you

46:39.542 --> 46:41.544
is because you let them, okay?

46:41.577 --> 46:43.379
And math is all about practice.

46:43.412 --> 46:45.481
You just need to buckle up
and do the work. That's it.

46:45.514 --> 46:47.350
But will you
help me do the work, Papá?

46:47.383 --> 46:49.619
No! No, you-you need to learn
to do everything by yourself

46:49.653 --> 46:51.387
because no one's gonna help you.

46:51.420 --> 46:53.122
No one is gonna help you ever.

46:56.359 --> 46:57.693
Hey, stop. No.

46:57.728 --> 46:59.595
<i>¡Papá!! Ay, no!</i>

47:01.530 --> 47:04.300
Wow. Your
stepson was just hit by a semi.

47:04.333 --> 47:05.401
I don't care.

47:07.771 --> 47:09.438
<i>You excited to meet our sister?</i>

47:09.472 --> 47:11.240
<i>Shut up.</i>

47:16.479 --> 47:19.348
Are you Eloise?

47:20.750 --> 47:22.652
Uh, hi.

47:22.685 --> 47:25.454
Uh, Flavio Murguia sent us.

47:27.490 --> 47:28.658
Mm, great.

47:28.691 --> 47:30.593
He doesn't like you, either.

47:30.626 --> 47:32.261
Excuse me. Sir?

47:33.295 --> 47:35.531
Your dad's had me hold on
to this for a while now.

47:35.564 --> 47:37.700
Said one day
somebody would come for it.

47:42.838 --> 47:44.640
This is my father's
wedding ring.

47:45.608 --> 47:48.344
I'm here to see
that he pawned it off?

47:48.377 --> 47:50.279
No.

47:50.312 --> 47:52.748
You're here to understand how
it got here in the first place.

47:54.283 --> 47:56.385
- Did you know our dad?
- I did.

47:56.419 --> 47:58.688
He was an easy man to like.

47:58.721 --> 48:00.690
We've stayed in touch
over the years.

48:00.723 --> 48:03.993
Oh. I'm glad to see
that he kept in touch with you.

48:04.026 --> 48:05.795
Listen, it's been a long ride,

48:05.828 --> 48:07.563
and I really need
some answers, so...

48:07.596 --> 48:09.532
Maybe you ought to learn
to shut your mouth

48:09.565 --> 48:11.333
and listen to the story.

48:11.367 --> 48:13.502
Ooh-wee, I like this guy.

48:13.536 --> 48:17.606
Must've been
at least 20 years ago now.

48:17.640 --> 48:20.276
One day, that front door opens,

48:20.309 --> 48:22.778
and this man comes stumbling in
all beat to hell.

48:22.812 --> 48:25.014
Hey, hey.

48:25.047 --> 48:26.782
You looking for trouble,
you've come to the wrong place.

48:26.816 --> 48:27.817
You understand?

48:27.850 --> 48:29.418
No, no, no. I'm sorry, sir.

48:29.452 --> 48:32.421
Please.
I-I'm not here to rob you.

48:32.455 --> 48:35.357
I just need enough
for a bus ticket, please.

48:35.391 --> 48:37.727
I-I'll sell you
everything I have.

48:37.760 --> 48:39.729
Okay? Just take it.

48:39.762 --> 48:43.231
I can't sell any of this.
No, no, no, don't. I...

48:44.700 --> 48:46.502
- Take it.
- No, I-I can't sell any of this.

48:49.605 --> 48:50.740
Please.

48:50.773 --> 48:53.476
Take it all.

48:53.509 --> 48:56.311
The ring.
I can sell the ring.

48:59.782 --> 49:01.784
So, what happened to him?

49:01.817 --> 49:03.418
What you need to know

49:03.452 --> 49:05.386
is that all your father
cared about

49:05.420 --> 49:07.656
was getting back
to his family in Mexico.

49:07.690 --> 49:10.659
<i>So, with the little money
he had,</i>

49:10.693 --> 49:14.329
<i>he bought a bus ticket to
the border in El Paso, Texas.</i>

49:14.362 --> 49:16.866
Bus leaves in 15 minutes.

49:16.899 --> 49:20.803
<i>That bus stopped
here in Oklahoma City.</i>

49:37.720 --> 49:39.487
Get the money.

49:39.521 --> 49:40.455
Get the money.

49:40.488 --> 49:41.757
Here, go.

49:47.695 --> 49:49.364
Where you going?

49:50.665 --> 49:51.867
<i>But then they took the thing</i>

49:51.901 --> 49:53.668
<i>that he cared about the most.</i>

49:54.904 --> 49:56.738
His only way home.

49:59.942 --> 50:02.677
The ring.
I can sell the ring.

50:07.983 --> 50:09.818
No. No, no, no.

50:09.852 --> 50:11.120
Please.

50:12.587 --> 50:14.322
I beg you.

50:15.557 --> 50:17.358
Okay, look.

50:17.392 --> 50:19.727
I'll make a deal with you,
all right?

50:19.761 --> 50:22.463
I will personally buy
the ring from you.

50:23.498 --> 50:24.766
Just me.

50:24.799 --> 50:27.702
And I will hold on to it
for you for 90 days.

50:27.735 --> 50:29.470
Okay?
I promise I won't sell it.

50:29.504 --> 50:30.605
No one.

50:30.638 --> 50:31.873
Promise.

50:31.906 --> 50:34.843
You come back
and bring me the money...

50:34.876 --> 50:37.645
the-the same price
as the ring, okay?

50:37.679 --> 50:39.547
And it's yours.

50:43.751 --> 50:46.821
<i>And once he finally got
all the way to El Paso,</i>

50:46.855 --> 50:50.692
<i>it was just a long walk home
to the border.</i>

50:55.530 --> 50:57.799
You're about to enter Mexico.

51:16.517 --> 51:18.820
Hold it right there, sir.
Don't move.

51:18.853 --> 51:20.989
Hands in the air.
Hands in the air, sir.

51:21.022 --> 51:22.757
Please.

51:22.790 --> 51:24.959
I-I'm just trying to get back
to my family.

51:24.993 --> 51:26.794
- Why is there blood on you?
- Whose blood is that?

51:26.828 --> 51:28.997
Please, I-I just want
to see my son.

51:29.030 --> 51:31.399
I said keep your hands up.

51:38.239 --> 51:40.041
I'm coming for you, boy!

51:40.074 --> 51:41.609
What you looking at?

51:43.544 --> 51:46.047
<i>They put your dad
in general population.</i>

51:53.955 --> 51:56.658
<i>Your father was stuck there.</i>

51:56.691 --> 51:58.226
<i>No one was coming for him,</i>

51:58.259 --> 52:01.796
<i>because no one even knew
he was there.</i>

52:01.829 --> 52:03.965
And he was in there a long time.

52:05.532 --> 52:08.036
<i>And that's when he got sick.</i>

52:08.069 --> 52:09.804
<i>Real sick.</i>

52:13.741 --> 52:15.542
Dump him. Dump him.

52:26.754 --> 52:28.723
This is the second time

52:28.756 --> 52:31.525
I've had to hold on
to this ring.

52:31.558 --> 52:32.961
It belongs to you now.

52:32.994 --> 52:36.764
But... but what happened
after that?

52:36.798 --> 52:38.800
Why didn't he come back?

52:43.570 --> 52:45.006
I'm done with this.

52:54.548 --> 52:56.516
Yo, what are you doing, man?

52:56.550 --> 52:58.585
I'm going home.
I'm done with this.

52:58.618 --> 53:00.587
Dude, you can't leave now.
Look.

53:00.620 --> 53:02.522
- Eloise.
- Oh, wow.

53:02.556 --> 53:04.025
Don't you want to know
how the story ends?

53:04.058 --> 53:06.995
Oh, I know how it ends.
I know how it ends.

53:07.028 --> 53:09.763
He doesn't come back.

53:09.796 --> 53:12.733
He cheats on me and my mom
with some American woman,

53:12.766 --> 53:15.036
has you and starts
a whole new life here.

53:15.069 --> 53:16.837
- That's it.
- No, that can't be the whole story.

53:16.870 --> 53:18.006
Come on, don't you want
the real answer?

53:18.039 --> 53:20.741
I got the answer, okay?!

53:20.774 --> 53:22.642
He forgot about me.

53:22.676 --> 53:25.012
That's it. He didn't die.

53:25.046 --> 53:28.316
Everything we're hearing about
was 25 years ago.

53:28.349 --> 53:29.916
What was he doing since then?

53:29.950 --> 53:31.952
Because he-he certainly wasn't
thinking about me.

53:31.985 --> 53:33.887
That whole story was
about him trying

53:33.920 --> 53:35.922
- to get back to you. He didn't...
- Oh, whatever.

53:35.956 --> 53:37.991
- He didn't forget about you.
- Excuses, excuses, man.

53:38.025 --> 53:40.761
I don't care, okay?
I-I have a life to go back to.

53:40.794 --> 53:42.863
I-I have a family.

53:42.896 --> 53:44.598
What's that supposed to mean?

53:44.631 --> 53:46.099
That means that
you're not my family.

53:46.133 --> 53:49.102
Okay? You're not my brother.
You mean nothing to me.

53:51.738 --> 53:53.073
Move, please. Move!

53:53.106 --> 53:54.641
Hey, don't bully him. He's...

53:54.674 --> 53:56.843
Move, Asher! Jesus.

53:56.877 --> 53:58.979
Hey, I meant what I said.

53:59.012 --> 54:00.881
You're gonna be
a terrible father.

54:00.914 --> 54:02.916
And you know what else?
You're a terrible son.

54:02.949 --> 54:04.985
Yeah, have a nice life.

54:12.159 --> 54:13.960
So, where you from?

54:17.398 --> 54:19.699
Hi. I'm gonna take
the first flight to Mexico City

54:19.733 --> 54:21.868
or whatever gets me the hell
out of this goddamn country.

54:23.770 --> 54:25.072
You're gonna have to
try that again.

54:25.105 --> 54:26.907
Is that how you speak
to your mother?

54:26.940 --> 54:29.042
I'm getting married
tomorrow, okay?

54:29.076 --> 54:31.678
And you better watch your tone
when you're talking to me.

54:31.711 --> 54:32.979
Okay.

54:33.013 --> 54:34.147
Now apologize.

54:34.181 --> 54:36.216
Fuck. What?

54:36.249 --> 54:38.085
Apologize.

54:39.786 --> 54:41.855
Apologize.

54:43.824 --> 54:45.892
I... I apologize.

54:45.926 --> 54:48.095
I apologize. I apologize.

54:48.128 --> 54:49.763
- Now, passport, please.
- Yes.

54:49.796 --> 54:51.731
Whatever you need, ma'am.
Whatever you need.

54:54.134 --> 54:55.836
Shit.

54:55.869 --> 54:58.705
I... I left it in the car.

54:58.738 --> 55:00.207
But I-I have a photo

55:00.240 --> 55:01.842
of my passport in my phone here.

55:01.875 --> 55:03.210
I would really love
to help you, but, honey,

55:03.243 --> 55:04.845
you ain't flying nowhere
without a passport.

55:04.878 --> 55:06.146
I need to get into that flight.

55:06.179 --> 55:08.748
Please, please
help me out here. Please.

55:10.817 --> 55:12.986
All right.
Here's what you do.

55:13.019 --> 55:14.821
- Yeah.
- Take out your phone.

55:14.855 --> 55:16.189
- Okay.
- Dial this number.

55:16.223 --> 55:18.725
- 1-800...
- Yeah?

55:18.758 --> 55:20.727
I don't give a shit!

55:20.760 --> 55:22.229
Find someone who cares.

55:22.262 --> 55:24.965
- Next customer.
- Shit!

55:29.803 --> 55:32.906
I can't, I can't,
I...

55:36.042 --> 55:38.777
Assholes Anonymous.
How may I help you?

55:40.147 --> 55:42.282
You're very funny.
That was very funny.

55:42.315 --> 55:44.084
Sometimes you're very funny.

55:44.117 --> 55:47.686
Listen, uh, I have
a small problem here, and, um,

55:47.720 --> 55:50.257
I...

55:50.290 --> 55:52.858
I really need your...
I really need your help.

55:52.892 --> 55:54.027
You're gonna have to speak up.

55:54.060 --> 55:55.228
I can't...
No, I can't hear you.

55:55.262 --> 55:57.696
I said I...
I really need your help.

55:57.730 --> 55:59.299
Can you hear him? I can't hear him.

55:59.332 --> 56:02.302
I really need your help, man.

56:14.813 --> 56:16.283
Okay, uh, I'm sorry.

56:16.316 --> 56:19.319
Okay? I-I...
I owe you an apology.

56:19.352 --> 56:22.222
The things I said back there,
I didn't mean it, okay?

56:22.255 --> 56:24.324
I'm sorry, and...

56:24.357 --> 56:27.026
I'm actually surprised
you-you come to pick me up.

56:27.059 --> 56:28.295
What are you talking about?

56:28.328 --> 56:30.062
What I'm...
what I'm talking about?

56:30.095 --> 56:31.298
Yeah.

56:31.331 --> 56:33.866
Well, why did you come
pick me up?

56:33.899 --> 56:35.935
'Cause, man,

56:35.968 --> 56:37.703
we're brothers.

56:39.038 --> 56:40.839
And don't you worry, bro.

56:40.873 --> 56:42.309
We're gonna get you to El Paso,

56:42.342 --> 56:45.512
and we're gonna re-sneak you
across that border.

56:45.545 --> 56:48.147
You'll be back for your wedding
in no time.

56:48.180 --> 56:49.949
Ain't that right, Renatito?

57:03.128 --> 57:04.830
You want something?

57:04.863 --> 57:06.265
Seaweed crisps.

57:08.968 --> 57:11.036
Come on. Come on.

57:11.070 --> 57:12.137
Come on.

57:12.171 --> 57:14.340
Hey.

57:14.373 --> 57:16.008
Hi.

57:16.041 --> 57:17.843
Look at this freak show.

57:17.876 --> 57:20.980
Hey. That your dog,
or is you just playing with it?

57:21.013 --> 57:23.282
It's okay. Don't worry.

57:23.315 --> 57:25.384
- Don't worry.
- Hey, you deaf, boy? Hey.

57:25.417 --> 57:27.353
They got the same calves.

57:27.386 --> 57:29.855
- You deaf?
- What you doing with that goat?

57:29.888 --> 57:31.257
Oh, that's love right there.

57:31.290 --> 57:32.992
Aw, aren't they cute?

57:33.025 --> 57:34.293
Run, boy, run.

57:34.326 --> 57:37.229
- Looks like he's gonna cry.
- Hey. Hey.

57:38.397 --> 57:41.166
Hey!

57:41.200 --> 57:42.801
Freak.

57:42.835 --> 57:43.936
Oh!

58:02.855 --> 58:04.957
What happened back there?

58:06.191 --> 58:08.227
What were those guys
saying to you?

58:08.260 --> 58:10.162
It was nothing, man.

58:10.195 --> 58:12.197
Didn't look like nothing.

58:13.299 --> 58:16.835
You shouldn't let people
treat you like that, you know?

58:16.869 --> 58:18.337
- It doesn't bother me.
- Oh, really?

58:18.370 --> 58:20.205
- No.
- Okay.

58:20.239 --> 58:22.074
People always make fun
of other people

58:22.107 --> 58:24.877
because they think
they're different.

58:24.910 --> 58:26.879
But they're not.

58:26.912 --> 58:29.448
I'm not different.

58:29.481 --> 58:33.952
Well, being different is not
a bad thing, you know?

58:35.154 --> 58:37.423
Nah, I know.

58:37.456 --> 58:39.958
All right.

58:43.162 --> 58:44.829
Oh.

58:45.464 --> 58:47.166
You didn't open this.

58:47.199 --> 58:49.201
We always open 'em together.

58:49.234 --> 58:51.836
- Can I?
- Yeah.

58:53.038 --> 58:56.141
Huh. Saint Mary's Convent.

58:56.175 --> 58:57.409
- Look at this.
- Whoa.

58:57.443 --> 58:59.144
Dude, do you think
our sister's a nun?

58:59.178 --> 59:01.380
Hey, wait.
What does that make us?

59:01.413 --> 59:02.947
Um, nothing.

59:02.980 --> 59:04.316
Oh.

59:04.350 --> 59:06.285
El Paso, Texas.

59:06.318 --> 59:08.187
El Paso?

59:08.220 --> 59:10.021
Come on, dude. Come on.

59:10.054 --> 59:12.023
Let's see if you can
take us there in time.

59:12.056 --> 59:13.958
Watch this.

59:29.408 --> 59:32.378
What's that? What's happening?

59:32.411 --> 59:35.012
What's happening?

59:37.282 --> 59:39.016
We're out of gas.

59:42.554 --> 59:45.056
- Are you kidding me right now?
- Hmm-mm.

59:46.057 --> 59:47.359
We are in the mid...
That was your only

59:47.393 --> 59:48.993
responsibility, dude.

59:49.026 --> 59:50.261
Why are you laughing?
Are you stupid?

59:50.294 --> 59:52.096
I love watching you
freak out, man.

59:52.130 --> 59:54.298
This is why I keep extra fuel
in the back.

59:54.332 --> 59:56.402
I'm pretty responsible, man.

1:00:00.238 --> 1:00:03.274
Oh, Renatito, no.

1:00:03.307 --> 1:00:04.443
Renatito, no.

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:06.177
- That is a naughty boy.
- Ah!

1:00:06.210 --> 1:00:08.012
- Oh, my God, I knew it!
- Hold on.

1:00:08.045 --> 1:00:09.715
- Hold on.
- Hold on?!

1:00:09.748 --> 1:00:11.550
I'm gonna kill that thing
when you're not looking, okay?!

1:00:11.583 --> 1:00:13.217
Don't bully him, man.

1:00:13.251 --> 1:00:15.019
I'm not joking!
I'm gonna kill that thing!

1:00:15.052 --> 1:00:17.054
We eat those things in Mexico.
They're very tasty!

1:00:17.088 --> 1:00:19.290
- Hey, he can hear you, asshole.
- You stupid...

1:00:20.592 --> 1:00:22.293
Okay, okay.

1:00:22.326 --> 1:00:23.529
You're stronger.
You're stronger.

1:00:26.397 --> 1:00:28.366
I'm sorry I punched you, okay?

1:00:28.399 --> 1:00:30.968
Ah, it's all right.
Brothers fight, man.

1:00:31.002 --> 1:00:33.271
- That's how we show love.
- Don't start with that, please.

1:00:33.304 --> 1:00:34.405
Hey, look.

1:00:34.439 --> 1:00:36.541
Oh, my God. Oh...

1:00:36.574 --> 1:00:38.943
Please have a phone.

1:00:41.078 --> 1:00:42.580
Jesus.

1:00:55.460 --> 1:00:57.428
Yes!

1:00:57.462 --> 1:00:59.497
Oh, shit. It's death.

1:00:59.530 --> 1:01:00.565
"It's death"?

1:01:00.598 --> 1:01:02.200
I mean...

1:01:02.233 --> 1:01:04.035
it's dead.
I mean it's-it's not working.

1:01:05.069 --> 1:01:07.371
Ooh, well, what do we have here?

1:01:08.473 --> 1:01:10.241
What are these things?

1:01:10.274 --> 1:01:11.409
I don't know.

1:01:11.442 --> 1:01:12.477
It smells like Grandma.

1:01:12.510 --> 1:01:14.245
It's moonshine.

1:01:15.379 --> 1:01:16.581
It's-it's pure alcohol.

1:01:16.614 --> 1:01:18.349
Oh, keep it away from me.

1:01:18.382 --> 1:01:20.551
One sip of pinot,
and whoo-wee, I'm out.

1:01:20.585 --> 1:01:23.287
That's it.

1:01:23.321 --> 1:01:26.090
We can make ethanol out of this.

1:01:26.123 --> 1:01:27.592
All we got to do is purify it,

1:01:27.625 --> 1:01:30.194
and then we can use that
to fuel your car.

1:01:30.228 --> 1:01:33.130
See? You are
a great engineer, man.

1:01:33.164 --> 1:01:35.032
Stop doubting yourself.

1:01:41.272 --> 1:01:43.508
Okay. That's it.

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:45.343
Okay. Okay, here we go.

1:01:45.376 --> 1:01:48.179
Why are you sweating so much?

1:01:48.212 --> 1:01:49.480
I'm a little nervous.

1:01:49.514 --> 1:01:51.382
Okay, give me that.

1:01:51.415 --> 1:01:53.184
Where'd you...
where'd you find these, anyway?

1:01:53.217 --> 1:01:54.519
In the creepy drawer
next to the animal teeth.

1:01:54.552 --> 1:01:56.153
Okay. Listen.

1:01:56.187 --> 1:01:58.389
We need to be very fast
with this, okay?

1:01:58.422 --> 1:02:01.057
None of the ethanol vapors
can get out.

1:02:01.091 --> 1:02:02.827
- You got it? You got it?
- I got it.

1:02:02.860 --> 1:02:04.829
- The ethanol. The vapors.
- Yes.

1:02:04.862 --> 1:02:06.430
It's gonna be very strong, okay?

1:02:06.464 --> 1:02:09.132
It's pure alcohol,
so please don't inhale it.

1:02:10.535 --> 1:02:11.636
You don't need
to hold your breath.

1:02:11.669 --> 1:02:13.404
- No, I know.
- Okay.

1:02:13.437 --> 1:02:15.406
- Are you ready for this?
- Yeah, yes. Yes.

1:02:15.439 --> 1:02:17.140
- Okay.
- Don't be nervous.

1:02:17.173 --> 1:02:18.476
- I'm not. No, I'm...
- Just concentrate, okay?

1:02:18.509 --> 1:02:19.677
- Yeah, I'm excited.
- Okay.

1:02:19.710 --> 1:02:22.112
- And go.
- Yes. Yes.

1:02:25.383 --> 1:02:27.150
Tie it off. Tie it off.
Quickly.

1:02:28.886 --> 1:02:30.621
Dude, what are you doing?!

1:02:31.589 --> 1:02:33.524
- Jesus! Tie it off! Tie it off!
- Dude, that is...

1:02:33.558 --> 1:02:35.393
- Hey, that is strong, man.
- Yes, it's-it's strong

1:02:35.426 --> 1:02:37.193
- because it's pure alcohol!
- Oh, my God. Are you hot?

1:02:37.227 --> 1:02:38.563
What are you doing?!

1:02:38.596 --> 1:02:40.230
- I'm super hot.
- What are you doing?!

1:02:40.263 --> 1:02:41.432
What are you doing?!
Tie it off!

1:02:41.465 --> 1:02:43.434
- Tie it off, you idiot!
- Oh, man.

1:02:43.467 --> 1:02:44.569
Oh, shit.

1:02:44.602 --> 1:02:46.369
What are you doing?

1:02:46.404 --> 1:02:48.706
- Control yourself! Jesus!
- I'll get the next one.

1:02:48.739 --> 1:02:51.141
Oh, shit!

1:02:53.477 --> 1:02:54.712
Oh, my God, look at it.

1:02:54.745 --> 1:02:57.213
Whoa. Very big.

1:02:57.247 --> 1:02:58.381
It's very big.

1:02:59.617 --> 1:03:02.319
You got us both
completely wasted.

1:03:04.922 --> 1:03:06.591
Hey. Focus.

1:03:06.624 --> 1:03:08.458
- Don't... don't hit me.
- Okay, let me do it. I got it.

1:03:08.491 --> 1:03:10.160
- I got it.
- Don't...

1:03:19.436 --> 1:03:21.672
So, how we doing, man?

1:03:21.706 --> 1:03:22.740
We get enough balloons or what?

1:03:22.773 --> 1:03:24.374
Yeah, I think so.

1:03:24.407 --> 1:03:26.176
Yeah, now we just got to
wait for the ethanol

1:03:26.209 --> 1:03:28.646
to cool itself, but I-I think
it-it should work. Yeah.

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:30.614
Look at us, man.

1:03:30.648 --> 1:03:33.283
The Murguia brothers.

1:03:33.316 --> 1:03:34.618
Kicking ass.

1:03:38.288 --> 1:03:39.489
Can I ask you something?

1:03:39.522 --> 1:03:41.625
- Yeah.
- What did you mean

1:03:41.658 --> 1:03:44.628
when you said
Dad gave up on you?

1:03:44.661 --> 1:03:46.630
- That was nothing, man.
- No, no, no.

1:03:46.663 --> 1:03:49.165
I'm, uh... I'm intrigued.

1:03:49.199 --> 1:03:51.401
It looked to me like
you guys were very close.

1:03:51.434 --> 1:03:54.371
I don't know.
Dad and I never really clicked.

1:03:54.404 --> 1:03:56.172
You know?

1:03:56.206 --> 1:03:59.409
And then, when I was 12...

1:03:59.442 --> 1:04:02.245
I guess he realized I wasn't
the son he really wanted.

1:04:06.449 --> 1:04:08.953
And then, when I dropped out
of college and...

1:04:08.986 --> 1:04:12.288
messed up with all those jobs,

1:04:12.322 --> 1:04:14.557
Dad was like,

1:04:14.591 --> 1:04:17.460
"That's it. I'm done with you."

1:04:18.795 --> 1:04:21.966
Then he asked me if I wanted
to go on a road trip,

1:04:21.999 --> 1:04:24.300
and I was like,

1:04:24.334 --> 1:04:26.603
"Yeah, I love road trips.
Of course."

1:04:27.604 --> 1:04:29.239
Then he took me to this...

1:04:31.307 --> 1:04:33.777
...mm, place.

1:04:33.810 --> 1:04:37.380
These guys,
they put me in a room.

1:04:37.414 --> 1:04:39.549
But I could hear Dad arguing
with the doctor.

1:04:39.582 --> 1:04:42.318
He kept saying,

1:04:42.352 --> 1:04:45.288
"No, there's something wrong
with him.

1:04:45.321 --> 1:04:47.524
There has to be
something wrong with him."

1:04:49.292 --> 1:04:51.761
I don't know.

1:04:51.795 --> 1:04:54.397
Maybe there is.

1:04:54.431 --> 1:04:56.700
There's nothing wrong with you.

1:04:56.733 --> 1:04:58.468
No, I know.

1:04:58.501 --> 1:05:01.571
You know. It's just...

1:05:01.604 --> 1:05:03.406
It's-it's kind of like

1:05:03.440 --> 1:05:05.775
what you've been feeling,
though, you know?

1:05:07.477 --> 1:05:09.345
Like he ditched us.

1:05:10.346 --> 1:05:12.449
Yeah.

1:05:13.516 --> 1:05:15.518
Yeah, I thought...

1:05:16.786 --> 1:05:19.823
I thought, if I came here,
I could just

1:05:19.856 --> 1:05:23.393
look him in the eye
and ask him...

1:05:23.426 --> 1:05:25.462
why.

1:05:31.534 --> 1:05:35.638
Why didn't he come back
to us, hmm?

1:05:36.773 --> 1:05:38.641
That's why we got to see Eloise.

1:05:38.675 --> 1:05:40.043
Yeah.

1:05:40.076 --> 1:05:41.611
She's gonna give you
that answer.

1:05:41.644 --> 1:05:44.848
I would love to, man,
but I can't.

1:05:44.881 --> 1:05:48.685
I'm getting married tomorrow,
you know, so I have no time.

1:05:50.419 --> 1:05:52.889
Maybe if I hadn't lost
my passport.

1:05:52.922 --> 1:05:54.490
Yeah, I shouldn't
have trashed it.

1:05:55.625 --> 1:05:57.459
What?

1:05:57.493 --> 1:05:59.562
I shouldn't have trashed it
back at the motel.

1:05:59.596 --> 1:06:01.698
You're kidding me right now.

1:06:01.731 --> 1:06:03.298
No.

1:06:04.634 --> 1:06:06.401
You're not kidding me right now?

1:06:06.435 --> 1:06:07.837
I promised Dad I'd get you
all the way to Eloise.

1:06:07.871 --> 1:06:09.371
- You stupid... Who...
- You threatened to go home.

1:06:09.404 --> 1:06:10.472
- I...
- Who do you think you are?

1:06:10.506 --> 1:06:11.775
You stupid man.

1:06:11.808 --> 1:06:13.643
You're messing with my life now.

1:06:15.410 --> 1:06:17.080
You're-you're sitting here
wondering

1:06:17.113 --> 1:06:18.782
why everyone gives up on you.

1:06:18.815 --> 1:06:20.817
This is why, asshole.

1:06:20.850 --> 1:06:22.484
You are a fuckup!

1:06:31.627 --> 1:06:34.463
Hey. Um...

1:06:34.496 --> 1:06:37.699
look, you are totally right
to be sore at me, man.

1:06:37.733 --> 1:06:39.803
You know, I-I-I just got
so caught up

1:06:39.836 --> 1:06:41.871
in us doing this thing together,

1:06:41.905 --> 1:06:44.808
I-I didn't think about
your side of it, and...

1:06:44.841 --> 1:06:46.910
I'm really sorry, man.

1:06:46.943 --> 1:06:48.811
- I mean that.
- It's fine.

1:06:48.845 --> 1:06:50.546
- I'm over it.
- Are you sure?

1:06:50.579 --> 1:06:52.347
- Yeah.
- Because that-that wasn't cool.

1:06:52.381 --> 1:06:54.449
Yeah. I just want to go home.

1:06:54.483 --> 1:06:55.818
All right, well, let me...

1:06:55.851 --> 1:06:57.686
let me just use the bathroom,
all right?

1:06:57.719 --> 1:06:59.421
Yeah. Please just
hurry up, okay?

1:06:59.454 --> 1:07:00.489
Yeah, yeah.

1:07:11.733 --> 1:07:13.569
Don't judge me.

1:07:16.505 --> 1:07:17.472
Hey, man, is it just me,

1:07:17.506 --> 1:07:19.374
or is the door stuck?

1:07:19.408 --> 1:07:20.943
I need help, dude. Dude?

1:07:46.735 --> 1:07:48.904
That's weird.

1:07:48.937 --> 1:07:50.505
Dude?

1:07:51.506 --> 1:07:52.741
Yo, where'd he go, bro?

1:07:58.947 --> 1:08:01.917
There you are.
I was worried you...

1:08:32.814 --> 1:08:34.650
Hi.

1:08:36.685 --> 1:08:38.921
Good evening. How are you?

1:08:38.954 --> 1:08:40.789
I-I'm just try...
I'm just trying

1:08:40.822 --> 1:08:42.456
to-to get back to my friend.

1:08:42.490 --> 1:08:43.825
License and registration.

1:08:44.960 --> 1:08:47.629
Yes. Uh...

1:08:47.663 --> 1:08:50.899
listen, Officer, this is gonna
sound completely crazy to you,

1:08:50.933 --> 1:08:53.702
but I lost my passport.

1:08:53.735 --> 1:08:55.837
- I'm just trying to go back...
- What's that smell?

1:08:55.871 --> 1:08:58.006
Oh, that, um...

1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:00.742
It's... it...
it-it's not what you think.

1:09:00.776 --> 1:09:02.811
- That's ethanol.
- Step out of the car, sir.

1:09:04.713 --> 1:09:06.480
You can give me a Breathalyzer.

1:09:06.514 --> 1:09:07.548
I'm not a cop.
I'm border patrol.

1:09:07.581 --> 1:09:08.549
Now, step out of the car.

1:09:09.785 --> 1:09:11.552
Listen, I've seen
a lot of TV shows,

1:09:11.585 --> 1:09:12.921
and when the Mexican steps out
of the vehicle, it...

1:09:12.955 --> 1:09:14.689
Get out of the car now!

1:09:14.723 --> 1:09:16.691
Okay, yes. I'm not resisting.
I'm not resisting!

1:09:16.725 --> 1:09:18.827
Please, okay, this is a mistake.

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:21.863
- Is there anyone I can talk to?
- That would be the judge.

1:09:21.897 --> 1:09:23.731
Well, then just deport me.

1:09:23.765 --> 1:09:25.499
Don't you people love
doing that?

1:10:13.981 --> 1:10:15.616
Murguia!

1:10:15.649 --> 1:10:17.585
You're free to go.

1:10:18.619 --> 1:10:20.788
Let's go.

1:10:47.982 --> 1:10:49.683
<i>Dear Renato,</i>

1:10:49.717 --> 1:10:51.085
<i>You were right.</i>

1:10:51.118 --> 1:10:52.920
<i>I guess I do screw up
everyone's lives.</i>

1:10:52.953 --> 1:10:54.955
<i>And I'm sorry
I screwed up yours.</i>

1:10:54.989 --> 1:10:56.857
<i>The cops called me,</i>

1:10:56.891 --> 1:10:58.692
<i>told me a Mexican guy
with huge ears stole my car,</i>

1:10:58.726 --> 1:11:00.895
<i>but I cleared everything up
for you.</i>

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:03.197
<i>I really hope it gets you back
home in time for your wedding.</i>

1:11:03.230 --> 1:11:05.766
<i>Your little brother, Asher.</i>

1:11:17.778 --> 1:11:19.947
How'd you find me?

1:11:21.816 --> 1:11:23.084
What-what happened to your face?

1:11:23.117 --> 1:11:24.218
Who did that to you?

1:11:24.251 --> 1:11:25.753
Yeah.

1:11:25.786 --> 1:11:27.688
It was kind of crazy.

1:11:27.721 --> 1:11:29.890
It turns out
that cabin actually belonged

1:11:29.924 --> 1:11:31.659
to those guys
from the rest stop.

1:11:31.692 --> 1:11:32.893
You're talking about those...

1:11:32.927 --> 1:11:34.695
those rednecks
from the gas station?

1:11:34.728 --> 1:11:36.831
Yeah. They-they remembered
me, too.

1:11:36.864 --> 1:11:38.999
Oh, man, we need to get
some ice for your face.

1:11:39.033 --> 1:11:41.001
- No, I'm fine.
- No, we need to get some ice.

1:11:41.035 --> 1:11:42.069
I'm fine.

1:11:42.103 --> 1:11:44.004
Wait.

1:11:46.740 --> 1:11:48.142
Where's Renatito?

1:11:48.175 --> 1:11:49.844
Yeah...

1:11:49.877 --> 1:11:52.847
I got out of there
by the skin of my teeth.

1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:54.115
I couldn't save him.

1:11:54.148 --> 1:11:55.883
What do you mean, you...

1:11:55.916 --> 1:11:57.251
He's still there?

1:11:57.284 --> 1:11:58.986
- With those guys?
- Hey, look.

1:11:59.019 --> 1:12:01.889
Señor Renatito was
a good man, you know,

1:12:01.922 --> 1:12:03.424
and he really did
care about you.

1:12:03.457 --> 1:12:05.192
And I think what he'd want
more than anything

1:12:05.226 --> 1:12:07.627
is for you to get
to your wedding in time.

1:12:09.130 --> 1:12:10.965
Bullshit.

1:12:10.998 --> 1:12:14.201
I didn't pay for the doughnuts.

1:12:14.235 --> 1:12:16.237
Dude, you're never gonna
make it to your wedding.

1:12:16.270 --> 1:12:19.240
I don't get it. You always said
he was just a dumb goat.

1:12:19.273 --> 1:12:22.176
Hey. He's not a dumb goat.

1:12:44.031 --> 1:12:46.467
Now you're talking!

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.036
Goat sliced up. Tasty.

1:12:49.069 --> 1:12:52.306
Yeah, I like it! Yes, sir!

1:12:58.212 --> 1:13:01.148
Gonna have some nice
goat stew, too.

1:13:04.285 --> 1:13:06.920
Whoa!

1:13:08.755 --> 1:13:10.890
Shh.

1:13:21.067 --> 1:13:22.503
What the...?

1:13:23.970 --> 1:13:25.738
You...

1:13:25.772 --> 1:13:27.308
Ethanol, baby.

1:13:43.990 --> 1:13:45.225
Yes!

1:15:01.200 --> 1:15:03.202
All right.

1:15:05.438 --> 1:15:07.440
Are you ready to meet Eloise?

1:15:07.473 --> 1:15:09.808
Yeah.

1:15:12.879 --> 1:15:15.048
Maybe our sister's
married to Jesus.

1:15:15.081 --> 1:15:17.317
Well, at least someone
made it to their wedding.

1:15:21.287 --> 1:15:23.022
Can I help you?

1:15:23.056 --> 1:15:27.826
Uh, yes.
Uh, we're here to see Eloise.

1:15:32.031 --> 1:15:34.200
Well, there goes that trip.

1:15:44.677 --> 1:15:46.845
Wait here.

1:15:48.013 --> 1:15:49.382
All right.

1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:55.954
Oh, God.

1:15:55.987 --> 1:15:57.989
She even has Dad's nose.

1:16:06.031 --> 1:16:08.166
How I prayed for a sister.

1:16:08.201 --> 1:16:11.036
Eloise, it's so great
to finally hold you.

1:16:11.069 --> 1:16:13.004
I'm not Eloise.

1:16:13.038 --> 1:16:14.374
I'm Sister Marisa.

1:16:14.407 --> 1:16:17.976
Oh. Well, where's Eloise?

1:16:18.977 --> 1:16:20.912
If you want to see Eloise,

1:16:20.946 --> 1:16:22.914
you need to give me
the combination.

1:16:22.948 --> 1:16:25.951
- What-what do you mean?
- What combination?

1:16:38.263 --> 1:16:40.265
We have specific instructions.

1:16:40.298 --> 1:16:43.268
Anyone asking about Eloise
must have the code to the safe.

1:16:43.301 --> 1:16:45.036
Goddamn it!

1:16:45.070 --> 1:16:47.339
Dad with his goddamn riddles!

1:16:47.372 --> 1:16:49.040
Jesus Christ!

1:16:49.074 --> 1:16:50.510
What he means is

1:16:50.543 --> 1:16:52.144
he's really excited.

1:16:56.281 --> 1:17:00.051
Did Dad ever say something
to you about a combination?

1:17:00.085 --> 1:17:01.319
No.

1:17:03.188 --> 1:17:05.023
There's-there's got to be
something, you know?

1:17:05.056 --> 1:17:07.959
Some-some clue,
something we're not seeing.

1:17:07.993 --> 1:17:09.461
Oh. I got it.

1:17:09.494 --> 1:17:11.096
- Duh.
- What?

1:17:11.129 --> 1:17:12.998
It's my birthday.

1:17:19.271 --> 1:17:22.073
Then it's my birthday.

1:17:26.344 --> 1:17:28.146
Jesus, all of this for nothing!

1:17:28.180 --> 1:17:29.749
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:17:29.782 --> 1:17:31.149
- All these days, all these...
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:17:31.183 --> 1:17:33.051
Hold on. Hold on.

1:17:33.084 --> 1:17:34.319
We can figure this out.

1:17:36.254 --> 1:17:38.423
"Jesus said to them,
'Did you never read

1:17:38.457 --> 1:17:40.559
in the Scriptures, the s...'"
I don't know how to...

1:17:40.592 --> 1:17:42.427
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

1:17:42.461 --> 1:17:45.230
Give me my... give me
my passport. Give me...

1:17:46.598 --> 1:17:50.235
Oh, God! That's...
Stop it! Stop it!

1:17:52.103 --> 1:17:53.772
I-I... I can't do this anymore.

1:17:53.805 --> 1:17:55.273
- I need to go.
- What?

1:17:55.307 --> 1:17:57.442
- Yeah.
- Come on, man. We're so close.

1:17:57.476 --> 1:17:59.144
We are so close.

1:17:59.177 --> 1:18:01.613
I-I'll never make it home
in-in time.

1:18:01.646 --> 1:18:03.482
I need to go. I'm sorry.

1:18:03.515 --> 1:18:07.085
I totally understand if-if
you want to stay, but I can't.

1:18:07.118 --> 1:18:08.487
I'm sorry, man.

1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:11.022
Ah, at least we saw life
through Dad's eyes.

1:18:11.056 --> 1:18:12.791
- Yeah.
- As he used to say,

1:18:12.824 --> 1:18:14.392
"It's always good
to look at things

1:18:14.426 --> 1:18:16.461
from a different perspective."

1:18:19.231 --> 1:18:20.398
Wait.

1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:24.503
What does this say?

1:18:24.536 --> 1:18:26.371
- Eloise.
- Mm.

1:18:26.404 --> 1:18:29.040
And from a different
perspective?

1:18:31.376 --> 1:18:33.111
Son of a bitch.

1:18:54.199 --> 1:18:56.434
I hope this is recording
and I'm not just sitting here

1:18:56.468 --> 1:18:58.270
talking to myself like an idiot.

1:19:00.438 --> 1:19:04.141
If you've made it this far,
you're near the end.

1:19:04.174 --> 1:19:06.545
I hope it's been
a fun trip for you both.

1:19:08.178 --> 1:19:10.315
I apologize
for the long journey.

1:19:10.348 --> 1:19:13.183
And now that you've heard
a lot of things,

1:19:13.217 --> 1:19:16.555
I want you to hear
the rest from me.

1:19:16.588 --> 1:19:19.624
The first thing
you should know is...

1:19:22.192 --> 1:19:24.194
...I've not been a good man.

1:19:25.497 --> 1:19:29.300
I feel like all I've ever done
all my life is

1:19:29.333 --> 1:19:31.703
hurt the ones I love the most.

1:19:31.736 --> 1:19:34.338
Now, I'm not asking
for your forgiveness...

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:39.076
...but you deserve to know
the truth about everything.

1:19:40.545 --> 1:19:43.380
<i>That night, outside the prison,</i>

1:19:43.414 --> 1:19:45.215
I knew I was about to die.

1:19:46.216 --> 1:19:48.419
<i>But then, I swear...</i>

1:19:49.420 --> 1:19:52.524
<i>...I saw angels above me.</i>

1:19:52.557 --> 1:19:55.627
<i>The sisters said
I was barely conscious.</i>

1:19:56.628 --> 1:19:59.163
<i>I was so sick,</i>

1:19:59.196 --> 1:20:02.132
<i>they took care of me for months.</i>

1:20:02.166 --> 1:20:04.335
I owe my life to them.

1:20:05.604 --> 1:20:08.472
<i>And then, finally,</i>

1:20:08.505 --> 1:20:10.675
<i>I could go home.</i>

1:20:10.709 --> 1:20:13.310
<i>I made it all the way
to the border.</i>

1:20:13.344 --> 1:20:15.346
<i>I was so close to home,</i>

1:20:15.379 --> 1:20:18.282
<i>but then, at that moment,</i>

1:20:18.315 --> 1:20:20.217
<i>I got this feeling.</i>

1:20:20.250 --> 1:20:22.252
<i>Uh, something inside me</i>

1:20:22.286 --> 1:20:25.489
just couldn't let me
cross over for good

1:20:25.522 --> 1:20:28.325
<i>until I apologized to her.</i>

1:20:28.359 --> 1:20:31.295
<i>I had no idea how my life
was about to change.</i>

1:20:55.753 --> 1:20:58.656
<i>This baby was in danger.</i>

1:21:06.230 --> 1:21:08.732
<i>I could never blame her
for not accepting my apology.</i>

1:21:08.766 --> 1:21:12.302
But I already went through the
pain of leaving one son behind.

1:21:13.470 --> 1:21:15.272
<i>I couldn't do it to another.</i>

1:22:02.319 --> 1:22:04.253
Flavio.

1:22:40.924 --> 1:22:42.659
<i>This was all my fault,</i>

1:22:42.693 --> 1:22:44.828
not hers.

1:22:44.862 --> 1:22:47.296
You have to realize

1:22:47.330 --> 1:22:49.465
your mother was just trying
to protect you.

1:22:49.499 --> 1:22:51.501
And I thought it would be
easier for you

1:22:51.534 --> 1:22:53.269
if you just slowly...

1:22:54.537 --> 1:22:56.707
...forgot about me.

1:22:57.875 --> 1:23:00.276
<i>I should have done more.</i>

1:23:02.512 --> 1:23:06.349
<i>I should have just found a way
to come see you.</i>

1:23:07.350 --> 1:23:09.820
<i>Ay, Renato, mijo.</i>

1:23:11.554 --> 1:23:14.323
I want you to know
how special you were to me.

1:23:16.392 --> 1:23:18.728
You were the love of my life.

1:23:21.564 --> 1:23:24.567
And I have to live
with this guilt every day.

1:23:24.600 --> 1:23:26.103
But you,

1:23:26.136 --> 1:23:28.738
<i>you are the one
who has suffered the most.</i>

1:23:28.771 --> 1:23:32.876
In some kind of way, I...
I tried to make up for it

1:23:32.910 --> 1:23:36.813
by putting all my energy
into you, Asher.

1:23:36.846 --> 1:23:40.416
I wanted to be
such a good father to you,

1:23:40.449 --> 1:23:44.687
but I failed you, too, didn't I?

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:47.690
<i>In my small, simple mind,</i>

1:23:47.723 --> 1:23:51.594
<i>I tried to recapture with you
what I had with Renato.</i>

1:23:51.627 --> 1:23:54.430
<i>But, Asher, you were so...</i>

1:23:54.463 --> 1:23:55.598
unique.

1:24:04.006 --> 1:24:07.510
<i>And I didn't know
how to connect with you.</i>

1:24:09.979 --> 1:24:14.450
<i>So, instead, I pulled away...</i>

1:24:14.483 --> 1:24:16.586
<i>for far too long.</i>

1:24:21.490 --> 1:24:22.625
<i>Asher,</i>

1:24:22.658 --> 1:24:25.695
my sweet, beautiful boy,

1:24:25.728 --> 1:24:28.164
I am so sorry it took me so long

1:24:28.198 --> 1:24:30.867
to see there was never
anything wrong with you.

1:24:34.804 --> 1:24:36.839
I want you to know

1:24:36.873 --> 1:24:38.908
I never gave up on you.

1:24:39.909 --> 1:24:41.611
Never.

1:24:42.612 --> 1:24:45.815
Asher, you have
such a caring heart.

1:24:46.816 --> 1:24:49.485
This world needs you so much.

1:24:49.518 --> 1:24:53.589
You're going to do so much good
with everybody you touch.

1:24:54.991 --> 1:24:57.660
I made both of you feel

1:24:57.693 --> 1:24:59.896
like you were not
the son I wanted,

1:24:59.929 --> 1:25:01.797
but in truth...

1:25:03.599 --> 1:25:05.701
...I was not the father
you deserved.

1:25:05.735 --> 1:25:10.039
And I know there's nothing
I can do to make up for it...

1:25:11.641 --> 1:25:13.676
...but I still felt
I had to try.

1:25:14.677 --> 1:25:18.413
<i>So, when life decided to
throw me one last curveball...</i>

1:25:20.482 --> 1:25:23.619
<i>...I decided to put
this whole trip together.</i>

1:25:25.554 --> 1:25:28.523
<i>To put my two boys together.</i>

1:25:29.959 --> 1:25:31.661
Because my hope is

1:25:31.694 --> 1:25:34.830
<i>that even though
it might seem like I'm gone,</i>

1:25:34.864 --> 1:25:38.566
<i>we could still do this together.</i>

1:25:39.902 --> 1:25:42.604
My biggest regret
is not being able

1:25:42.638 --> 1:25:46.809
to share this final journey
with you.

1:25:46.842 --> 1:25:50.012
And even though
I'm no longer here,

1:25:50.046 --> 1:25:53.950
please know I am always with you

1:25:53.983 --> 1:25:57.720
and I am always
watching over you both.

1:26:01.958 --> 1:26:03.692
Wait.

1:26:03.725 --> 1:26:05.962
What-what last journey?

1:26:05.995 --> 1:26:08.563
What is he talking about?

1:26:08.596 --> 1:26:10.066
With Eloise.

1:26:11.067 --> 1:26:13.102
- What?
- What? S...

1:26:13.135 --> 1:26:15.037
So, there is an Eloise?

1:26:16.038 --> 1:26:17.672
Would you like to see her?

1:27:24.039 --> 1:27:25.874
What are you thinking about?

1:27:28.176 --> 1:27:31.079
The way I left him
in the hospital.

1:27:34.115 --> 1:27:36.584
I didn't even
say goodbye to him.

1:27:38.987 --> 1:27:41.089
I didn't... I didn't even...

1:27:41.122 --> 1:27:42.724
- tell him...
- He knew.

1:27:44.826 --> 1:27:46.161
He knew.

1:27:46.194 --> 1:27:47.929
Yeah.

1:27:59.741 --> 1:28:02.811
Well...
you got a wedding to catch.

1:28:02.844 --> 1:28:05.814
- Yeah. Yes, I do.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:28:21.096 --> 1:28:22.997
Thanks, Asher.

1:28:23.031 --> 1:28:24.833
For everything.

1:28:42.150 --> 1:28:43.785
Fly safe, amigo.

1:29:27.794 --> 1:29:30.231
I know.

1:29:32.100 --> 1:29:34.202
Hey!

1:29:35.936 --> 1:29:37.272
What's wrong?
What's going on?

1:29:37.305 --> 1:29:39.006
Uh...

1:29:39.040 --> 1:29:40.941
We need to get you a suit.

1:29:42.177 --> 1:29:44.978
I can't get married
without my brothers.

1:31:03.156 --> 1:31:05.292
<i>If you were to ask me now</i>

1:31:05.325 --> 1:31:07.894
<i>if a father and son
should be best friends,</i>

1:31:07.928 --> 1:31:09.796
<i>I would say...</i>

1:31:09.830 --> 1:31:11.965
<i>of course they should.</i>

1:31:41.028 --> 1:31:42.863
Ooh.
