00:33.616 --> 00:38.872
<i>When everyone lies,</i>
<i>telling the truth isn't just rebellion.</i>

00:40.540 --> 00:42.208
<i>It's an act of revolution.</i>

00:44.627 --> 00:49.466
<i>So think carefully when you speak it,</i>
<i>because the truth is a weapon.</i>

00:49.549 --> 00:50.925
So how'd she die?

00:53.303 --> 00:56.431
Did she fall

00:58.308 --> 00:59.476
Was she fucking pushed?

01:00.810 --> 01:02.937
Who?

01:04.355 --> 01:07.984
Just a little bubblefab street whore
named Mary Lou Henchy.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.944
I never heard of her.

01:20.747 --> 01:24.459
From that height,
it's the impact on the water killed her.

01:25.168 --> 01:29.464
But when the cops went to spin her up,
they found out she was coded Neo-C.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.549
Maybe she kept it secret.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.676
Not from me. We grew up together.

01:38.890 --> 01:43.561
You're a senior sys op,
interplanetary record and coding.

01:44.020 --> 01:47.732
Listen, you got root access
to the entire Protectorate database.

01:48.608 --> 01:52.195
I'm just a systems tech.
I don't handle religious conversions.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.781
But you didn't do a religious conversion.

01:55.865 --> 01:57.158
You faked her code.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.702
You can't fake religious coding
on a stack.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.496
What the hell do you want from me?

02:05.375 --> 02:06.376
How did she die?

02:06.459 --> 02:08.586
Oh, God, I don't know.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.174
-I don't know.

02:13.258 --> 02:16.261
I don't know!

02:16.344 --> 02:19.264
Put the gun down.
Step away from him.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.895
There's no witness
on Mary Lou's conversion,

02:25.979 --> 02:28.773
no personal statement,
no four levels of fucking protocol.

02:28.857 --> 02:33.236
-Just his office writing the re-code.
-I don't know what he's talking about.

02:33.903 --> 02:35.196
Someone runs you.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.742
And you're gonna tell me who.

02:41.953 --> 02:44.664
Hey, think about this.

02:45.623 --> 02:50.128
CTAC doesn't handle religious coding.
That's domestic systems jurisdiction.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.007
They only touch DHF
when someone's shipping between worlds,

02:54.090 --> 02:57.552
and I don't think Mary Lou
ever got close to jumping planets.

02:59.179 --> 03:03.433
The reason why he has no answers
is because what you are talking about

03:04.225 --> 03:05.560
is not real.

03:06.477 --> 03:08.563
There's no conspiracy.

03:14.777 --> 03:16.196
Just a dead friend.

03:19.449 --> 03:23.578
And you and me. You and me.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.081
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh...

03:28.666 --> 03:30.210
Ah...

03:35.506 --> 03:37.842
Go, go. Go. Go.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.693
Hey.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.157
She's all alone in there.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.409
I know, Ryker.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.995
I know.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.042
I'm wearing your fucking boyfriend?

04:11.125 --> 04:13.711
-I have trust issues.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.964
Yeah

04:16.130 --> 04:19.008
With you. You don't find a killer,
you go back on ice.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.178
-Little conflict of interest there.
-Bancroft sleeves me in a crooked cop.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.305
Might as well have "shoot me"
branded on my forehead.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.557
And you don't say anything
because you want me to fail

04:26.641 --> 04:29.227
-so you can get Ryker back.
-Ryker wasn't crooked.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.188
In case you hadn't realized.
When are you gonna get it?

04:32.272 --> 04:33.773
Bancroft wasn't murdered.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.068
So you've been following me to make sure
this sleeve doesn't get damaged

04:37.151 --> 04:39.195
because you knew
people wanted to damage it.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.990
You ever think some of them
might be gunning for me, not Ryker?

04:42.073 --> 04:43.866
I followed you because you're a terrorist.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.952
Dimi 1 came after me at the Raven.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.621
Ever wonder why he was here?
Why he knew my real name?

04:48.705 --> 04:52.250
Then we got Dimi the Second,
Mr. Disembodied.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.920
Works me over in virtual,
only he doesn't know my real name.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.880
Just sees the skin, calls me Ryker.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.465
But here's the best part.

05:00.049 --> 05:03.594
He thinks that Ryker killed
his so-called brother, Dimi the First.

05:03.678 --> 05:06.639
-Just get to the point.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.351
Because Dimi the Second framed Ryker
for the murder of a CTAC.

05:11.227 --> 05:14.397
Dimi's a real fucking talker
when he's chopping your body parts off.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.149
Dimi the Twin framed Ryker?

05:16.232 --> 05:19.777
Ryker's conspiracy,
Bancroft's murder, they're connected.

05:19.861 --> 05:20.695
How?

05:21.988 --> 05:23.406
Fuckin' ask him.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.206
I want to go in and see her.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.626
-Lizzie's getting better.
-No thanks to you.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.588
-This is not your decision.
-Oh, it most certainly is.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.466
You empowered me to make
medical decisions for Miss Elizabeth.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.134
That is what I'm talking about.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.178
No one's ever called her Elizabeth
in her life.

05:49.932 --> 05:52.143
-Kovacs.
Not now.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.521
I need to talk to you about Lizzie
and this megalomaniac you call a hotel.

05:55.605 --> 05:57.231
I don't have time for this.

05:57.857 --> 06:01.736
I told you before, we're not friends.
I don't owe you a goddamn thing.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.363
I'm chasing down my fucking leads
to get what I need.

06:04.447 --> 06:08.576
Which, in case anyone is interested,
is my freedom.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.205
-If I may...

06:12.288 --> 06:14.290
No, your speech was quite clear,

06:14.373 --> 06:16.876
-if a trifle laden with obscenities.
-That's not what he meant.

06:16.959 --> 06:20.505
Don't talk to me again unless you have
something useful to say, okay?

06:40.817 --> 06:43.569
That is a piece of rare,
antique linen that...

06:46.739 --> 06:49.242
you obviously are going to have
dry

06:50.993 --> 06:52.161
Professionally!

07:10.430 --> 07:13.015
Hey, Kovacs.
How'd you get in here?

07:13.307 --> 07:16.853
The guards'll be fine. Well, except for
the broken jaw and shattered leg.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.272
Yeah, well, I'm gonna
have to ask you to leave. Hey!

07:19.355 --> 07:21.607
Takeshi...

07:22.233 --> 07:23.734
stop damaging the help.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.419
-I asked you a question.

07:42.962 --> 07:48.092
Laurens has gone to the Old City
to minister to the masses.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.429
I could get you a car if you'd like.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.142
Or you could stay a while. With me.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.190
Did you like what we did together?

08:02.773 --> 08:04.192
Seems like a long time ago.

08:05.359 --> 08:06.986
It was night before last.

08:07.778 --> 08:12.366
Well, I've been in virtual for a while.
Busy screaming and dying.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.910
Because of the case?

08:14.619 --> 08:17.288
Not a lot of other reasons
for people to wanna kill me.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.790
Takeshi-<i>san,</i> listen to me.

08:20.666 --> 08:22.585
I want you to drop the case.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.379
I'll double whatever he's offering you.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.799
Buy you a new identity anywhere
in the Protectorate. A new life.

08:29.425 --> 08:30.801
He'll never find you.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.723
My husband dragged you here
and he locked you into a deal

08:35.806 --> 08:37.350
you had no choice but to accept.

08:37.975 --> 08:40.061
Do you really think he'll set you free?

08:40.478 --> 08:44.565
That's what the lease says.
I expect him to honor it.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.026
Mmm. Honor.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.655
He threw you into a fight pit.

08:53.115 --> 08:57.203
No. When you learn the truth,
the only possible truth,

08:57.537 --> 09:00.122
that Laurens pulled the trigger,
that he was weak and he gave up,

09:00.206 --> 09:03.042
he's a coward,
he won't forgive you for that.

09:04.752 --> 09:08.172
Your freedom, that thing you want so much,

09:09.215 --> 09:10.550
he'll make sure you never see it.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.474
You have no idea what he's capable of.

09:19.225 --> 09:20.726
You're terrified.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.647
He will want someone to punish.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.860
And my family means everything to me.

09:32.446 --> 09:36.409
Laurens will not allow what he loves
to grow and change.

09:37.493 --> 09:42.164
Our children, he's trapped them in kind of
a benevolent dependence forever.

09:42.248 --> 09:45.668
And when a Meth says "forever,"
it isn't hyperbole.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.421
So you're afraid of what he'll do
to all of you.

09:48.504 --> 09:50.256
I don't believe in punishment.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.759
I believe in reward.

09:55.761 --> 10:00.349
I have an island. It's mine.
Not even Laurens knows about it.

10:00.808 --> 10:05.605
Built a complex there, with a clone tank,
resleeving facilities...

10:07.607 --> 10:11.068
Sometimes I decant the clones
and let them play.

10:17.825 --> 10:20.494
Do you understand what I'm offering you?

10:25.249 --> 10:26.792
Imagine more of me.

10:29.420 --> 10:31.172
<i>A pack of bodies,</i>

10:31.672 --> 10:36.344
<i>orchestrated by the same mind, </i>
<i>with a singular focus.</i>

10:39.096 --> 10:40.181
You.

10:40.848 --> 10:42.308
<i>I'm multi-sleeved.</i>

10:43.309 --> 10:44.727
That could get you erased.

10:44.810 --> 10:48.105
Mmm. Uncountable, my sins.

10:48.189 --> 10:51.734
<i>And you can have all of me, </i>
<i>for as long as you'd like.</i>

10:51.817 --> 10:55.321
And when you're finished, your freedom.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.158
I'm not here to save you, Miriam.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.373
I believe I'm the one
offering to do the saving.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.208
Think about it.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.752
But don't take too long.
We're running out of time.

11:40.408 --> 11:44.078
Hey, Mickey... I have another job for you.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.041
You're gonna have to keep it quiet.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.461
Whatever you say, Lieutenant.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.008
Number two.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.808
Thanks.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.240
Officer Levine.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.122
Faith, Officer.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.124
You wear it openly.

12:31.208 --> 12:34.920
Ah. It's just a ring, man.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.423
I see a proud artifact of your heritage.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.427
Forgive me.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.054
You meet too few of the Chosen
in this city.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.015
Hey.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.017
You a believer?

12:56.942 --> 12:58.569
This is a restricted area.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.906
I work for Bancroft.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.867
<i>Warning. You are entering...</i>

13:04.950 --> 13:05.910
You're gonna need these.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.246
No prolonged skin contact.
You touch them, you die.

13:24.011 --> 13:27.014
City Father!
City Father! City Father!

13:32.728 --> 13:34.271
Want chocolate?
Yeah.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.982
Who wants to play
rock Yes!

13:37.066 --> 13:40.903
Rock, paper, scissors.

13:42.154 --> 13:43.823
What are you doing here, Kovacs?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.158
I didn't send for you.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.661
You put me in this body
just to punish Ortega.

13:50.454 --> 13:54.208
Go wait for me by the truck, little ones.
Go on. Run along.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.503
Keep your hands covered
or risk getting infected.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.300
You needed an effective sleeve.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.387
She needed to be taught some respect.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.430
Two birds, one stone.

14:08.514 --> 14:13.227
Petty move. Wasted my time.
Childish for someone your age, isn't it?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.648
What could you possibly know
about my age, Kovacs?

14:17.731 --> 14:20.568
Good point. I'd have chosen
a younger sleeve. Something more virile.

14:20.651 --> 14:22.319
Oh. Yes.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.154
No doubt.

14:24.738 --> 14:30.369
But then a young man sees himself
as a fighting and fucking machine, huh?

14:31.579 --> 14:36.542
But the truth is, it's at this age
that a man achieves real respect,

14:37.126 --> 14:42.423
for he has battled many times
and clearly triumphed.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.216
Who...

14:44.592 --> 14:47.970
Who are the most potent gods
after all, huh?

14:48.053 --> 14:50.556
Thank you.
-Odin.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.684
Jupiter. Zeus.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.771
A colossus is rarely a young man.

14:57.855 --> 15:01.984
He is father. With many children.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.284
You're infected.

15:10.868 --> 15:15.122
Well, no one from the outside world
will touch them.

15:15.205 --> 15:20.878
So this is my sacrifice
to help them feel noticed.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.379
It's spreading fast.

15:23.047 --> 15:24.548
Is it some kind of bio

15:24.840 --> 15:29.637
A contagion bomb went off by accident.

15:30.846 --> 15:34.308
These are the survivors?
They're descendants.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.145
The plague killed thousands within hours.

15:41.899 --> 15:44.902
But left these carriers, you see.

15:45.986 --> 15:50.366
And they were sealed off
in hundreds of camps like these.

15:53.702 --> 15:55.746
This isn't sacrifice. It's theater.

15:55.829 --> 15:59.041
If you care so much,
why don't you buy them new sleeves?

16:00.042 --> 16:02.836
You're saying
because I cannot fix everything,

16:03.545 --> 16:06.173
I should fix nothing at all.

16:11.762 --> 16:14.098
Where is it

16:14.682 --> 16:16.976
Jesus. You, coffee. Hot.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.103
Hey, hey.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.522
-Working on it.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.857
Gonna get you to stop asking me
to do things off the books?

16:23.941 --> 16:24.775
Nope.

16:26.860 --> 16:27.903
God damn it.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.615
It's Dimi the Twin.
I need to spin him up in virtual.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.660
Then we got him? The double-sleever,
that's great for erasure.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.580
I need to ask him a few questions.
About Ryker.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.208
-You don't want this logged.
-I don't want this logged.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.877
There's no way that we spin him up
in virtual without logging him.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
-We'd have to sleeve him in the real.
-Fine. Then we sleeve him.

16:46.714 --> 16:49.425
Okay. All right.
I'll open a personality-fragged sociopath

16:49.508 --> 16:51.969
with several decades' worth
of counter-infiltration firmware

16:52.052 --> 16:53.637
and a reputation for wanton real death,

16:53.721 --> 16:55.389
and throw him in the first available body.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.890
Great. You're the best, Mickey.

16:57.474 --> 16:58.475
Ow.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.394
-You really are the best.
-I'm pretty good.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.440
Mm-hmm. Mmm! Oh, my God,
this is cold, God damn it!

17:05.941 --> 17:07.443
Call me when you're done.

17:12.823 --> 17:15.409
I give them
something to believe in.

17:16.994 --> 17:19.079
It's just another display of power.

17:19.455 --> 17:24.209
Then you have misunderstood me.

17:27.254 --> 17:32.468
For power, true power, is... is hidden.

17:33.510 --> 17:36.388
Like a mammoth sea creature

17:36.472 --> 17:41.477
just beneath the surface of the ocean.

17:41.560 --> 17:46.523
Nothing but the faintest of ripples.

17:49.359 --> 17:54.281
I'd love to stay and debate
the finer points with you.

17:55.074 --> 17:58.410
I-- I'm gonna cast out soon.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.913
How long do we have?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.639
Are you stealing his liquor now?

19:01.014 --> 19:03.433
It's only stealing if you get caught.
See any cops?

19:10.357 --> 19:12.234
Oh, I'm sorry. Is this a bad time?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.617
Nope.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.390
Because I'm her partner.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.352
And because you wearing that face
is tearing her apart.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.396
So she told you I found out?

19:50.397 --> 19:52.733
This gonna be one of those
friendly warnings?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.443
It started friendly.

19:58.071 --> 20:00.908
Ryker and Kristin, they were close.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.203
After he went down,
she came apart at the seams.

20:04.995 --> 20:09.708
She believed she was responsible,
so she convinced herself he was set up.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.919
But the man had demons.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.378
And enemies.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.298
You know she's been paying
his sleeve mortgage?

20:17.507 --> 20:20.302
And on a lieutenant's pay.
That's not an easy thing to do.

20:20.719 --> 20:25.599
She never figured on an overbid
like Bancroft pulled. It was terrible.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.809
I know what you are.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.564
And I know that men and women
in harm's way grow closer.

20:36.485 --> 20:41.198
Promise to treat her
with decency and fairness.

20:41.531 --> 20:46.078
And whatever this insanity is
with Bancroft, you keep her away from it.

20:53.460 --> 20:55.045
So what's my word worth to you?

20:57.214 --> 20:59.132
Then I'll make my own promise.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.845
Hurt her, and I kill you.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.974
-I do.

21:17.526 --> 21:21.238
You will take care of Kristin
or you will answer to me.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.865
I'm not here to save anyone.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.702
Not even yourself?

21:37.838 --> 21:40.590
I brought you something
you can actually use.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.050
I spoke with a member of my union.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.846
-The AI Management Association.

21:45.929 --> 21:47.764
We manage a plethora of establishments.

21:47.848 --> 21:52.978
Music performance halls, restaurants,
and various entertainment venues.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.896
The point,
before the next fuckin' ice age.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.149
Ah, yes, well. It's Madison.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.612
The AI who manages Fightdrome.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.165
<i> Welcome home.</i>

22:39.691 --> 22:42.819
Calm down.

22:45.989 --> 22:47.199
Oh!

22:47.282 --> 22:48.658
You're an abomination!

22:48.742 --> 22:49.993
Don't shoot!

22:50.077 --> 22:51.620
Mom, give me that.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.121
The hell's going on?

22:53.205 --> 22:54.831
I've got this. Give me that.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.959
Okay, well, that explains everything.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.297
Yeah, well.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.758
You know, it's getting easier
to imagine putting holes in you

23:04.841 --> 23:06.343
every time you open your mouth.

23:13.725 --> 23:16.728
-I got a lead on Bancroft's murder.
Oh, yeah?

23:20.857 --> 23:23.318
He was at Fightdrome
the night he was killed. AI that manages the place
says there's footage.

23:27.405 --> 23:30.826
Fightdrome doesn't do footage.
That's the whole point.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.453
People pay top dollar
for once-in-a-lifetime bloodlettings.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.413
Just trust me.

23:36.331 --> 23:38.333
You sound just like Ryker.

23:39.751 --> 23:40.877
You guys used to be partners.

23:41.878 --> 23:43.213
Okay.

23:44.714 --> 23:46.174
What are you getting at?

23:52.055 --> 23:55.475
Ryker have any mannerisms
or speech patterns I should be aware of?

23:55.559 --> 23:59.813
Well, I did the talking and Ryker
mostly stood there looking angry.

23:59.896 --> 24:01.481
-I can do angry.
-Yeah, no shit.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.483
Just cross your arms or something.

24:04.025 --> 24:07.696
My, my.

24:07.779 --> 24:09.865
Elias Ryker.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.993
So the rumors are true.

24:13.451 --> 24:18.957
You're back from the rack
and riding your old skin.

24:19.749 --> 24:22.836
-None of your business, Carnage.

24:23.295 --> 24:27.007
Is that a new synth sleeve?
Thought the whole point was

24:27.090 --> 24:29.259
you could rearrange the face
into whatever you want.

24:29.676 --> 24:30.677
It is. And I did.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.934
Ah. Sorry. Private property.

24:38.018 --> 24:41.646
I think my all-access pass is that
you have cameras recording the fights.

24:44.900 --> 24:48.862
I built my brand on never broadcasting,
never recording anything--

24:48.945 --> 24:51.031
Laurens Bancroft was here
the night he died.

24:51.114 --> 24:54.242
We're following up.
We'd like to look at what happened.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.084
Hmm.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.340
Take it down a little bit.

25:08.423 --> 25:09.591
What?

25:10.759 --> 25:12.385
Stocked up on inventory.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.679
Ever expanding.

25:14.763 --> 25:17.307
We have a humiliation bout coming soon.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.142
-Very exclusive.
Oh, yeah?

25:19.226 --> 25:23.063
Still working out the details.
But we do have our subject matter.

25:23.146 --> 25:25.690
Oh, bit of both.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.985
So, who talked?

25:29.861 --> 25:32.948
We have data rats.
Rats dig. They dug something up.

25:33.031 --> 25:36.910
Does your rat have a name?
I'd like to meet him. Or her.

25:36.993 --> 25:39.829
-Or it.
Sure. I'll introduce you.

25:45.919 --> 25:51.675
Hot rod Envoy flesh,
with all the modern accoutrements.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.720
Taken from DNA harvested
on Harlan's World.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.806
You like it?

25:57.889 --> 26:00.350
Yeah. I can tell.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.311
I found a single cloning facility
in Edmonton

26:03.395 --> 26:05.772
willing to stitch together
something ancient and illegal

26:05.855 --> 26:07.524
for a one-time bloodletting.

26:08.149 --> 26:12.737
Cost me a king's ransom to grow him,
but people love the classics.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.867
Would you like to see it fight?

26:20.328 --> 26:21.871
Would you like to see it die?

26:22.455 --> 26:24.791
Or maybe you'd like to wear it?

26:24.874 --> 26:26.626
This old thing's worn out.

26:26.710 --> 26:27.961
Come back Friday.

26:28.753 --> 26:30.380
I'll put on a private show.

26:30.797 --> 26:31.715
Come on, Ryker.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.811
Pre

26:45.645 --> 26:46.604
Old-school.

26:46.688 --> 26:50.275
Practically pre-school
and thus unhackable.

26:50.775 --> 26:54.279
But apparently still whispered about
in the datastream.

26:57.282 --> 27:00.118
Hmm. That's Isaac.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.206
And here comes Bancroft.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.012
Bancroft was clearly on something.

27:19.095 --> 27:22.098
Or clearly wanted
to kill the shit out of his son.

27:36.946 --> 27:37.822
There.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.866
I've given you a free show,

27:39.949 --> 27:42.660
which is more than anyone else alive
has ever gotten from me.

27:42.744 --> 27:43.578
Show's over.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.801
You know I can read lips, right?

27:59.469 --> 28:02.764
-See, Bancroft kept saying,

28:02.847 --> 28:06.518
"You're not me. You never will be,"
over and over again.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.811
What do you make of that?

28:08.144 --> 28:11.064
Look, you want to believe
the guy was murdered, so...

28:11.481 --> 28:13.775
father attacked son. That goes to motive.

28:13.858 --> 28:16.569
But Isaac and just about
everyone else on Earth

28:16.653 --> 28:17.987
didn't have the means.

28:18.363 --> 28:21.199
No one can open that gun safe
except Miriam or Bancroft.

28:21.282 --> 28:22.659
It's gene-locked.

28:24.953 --> 28:27.163
I was trying to get Ryker
to quit this shit.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.998
Jeez.

28:46.516 --> 28:47.934
This is it.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.737
I could call for a search warrant,

28:58.820 --> 29:00.530
but it may be faster to go
for a knock and--

29:02.907 --> 29:06.578
Or Kovacs. We could Kovacs.

29:20.508 --> 29:21.384
What?

29:21.885 --> 29:25.472
Security alarms all call the police.
And I am the police.

29:48.328 --> 29:49.954
Bills of sale.

29:51.664 --> 29:52.957
These are real.

30:11.726 --> 30:12.769
Emitters.

30:17.023 --> 30:18.483
They're ONI-keyed.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.447
I can override the security seals.

30:29.410 --> 30:30.954
Why is he watching this?

30:31.871 --> 30:33.081
He hates his father.

30:40.046 --> 30:42.423
How do I know you are who you are?

30:43.383 --> 30:47.887
Before stacks, yeah. A face is a face.
But now, could be anyone in there.

31:01.484 --> 31:02.986
It's up to you.

31:04.070 --> 31:05.530
Kovacs.

31:09.158 --> 31:10.451
There you go.

31:13.746 --> 31:14.914
Wow.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.668
Portable 3-D bio-organic printer.

31:20.044 --> 31:22.922
Do you have any idea
how illegal and expensive these are?

31:23.548 --> 31:25.884
The cell mass you need to print is just...

31:26.801 --> 31:27.802
Wow.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.930
Even Bancroft slow-grows his clones.

31:31.639 --> 31:33.516
This must have cost Isaac
everything he had.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.852
Guess we know why
he was selling art.

31:52.535 --> 31:53.745
Bancroft.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.501
The Japanese didn't deal with Bancroft
in Osaka.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.837
Bancroft wasn't Bancroft.

32:03.755 --> 32:04.881
It was Isaac.

32:05.381 --> 32:07.800
Japanese told me they'd been dealing
with Bancroft for months.

32:07.884 --> 32:10.219
Then Bancroft closes the deal
in less than 48 hours?

32:10.303 --> 32:12.555
Doesn't let Isaac use an older sleeve,

32:13.348 --> 32:15.224
keeps him young
so no one takes him serious.

32:16.059 --> 32:17.894
But if Bancroft dies...

32:18.853 --> 32:20.605
the kids get nothing.

32:21.814 --> 32:23.399
So he can't die.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.237
Isaac didn't have to compete
with his father. He could be his father.

32:29.697 --> 32:33.493
Replace him, take everything he had.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.833
So how does it feel...

32:42.502 --> 32:44.629
to be a few hours away from freedom?

32:51.427 --> 32:53.596
-I have to call this in.

32:54.305 --> 32:55.473
It's Ortega.

32:56.516 --> 33:00.144
I need a team for a gene-mat sweep
and transport for an unlicensed sleeve.

33:01.729 --> 33:02.897
3-D printed.

33:05.942 --> 33:08.152
Yeah, might as well pick up
the printer, too.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.239
Sure. I'll wait here.

33:26.212 --> 33:30.258
<i>Finding truth is more </i>
<i>than a search for data. </i>

33:31.050 --> 33:33.052
<i>It's an excavation of self.</i>

33:33.803 --> 33:37.056
<i>You have to keep going, </i>
<i>no matter where it takes you.</i>

33:37.515 --> 33:39.976
<i>Because nothing can stay hidden forever.</i>

33:51.988 --> 33:54.157
You're coming with me. Now.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.498
You're gonna need this.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.851
-It's our place.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.521
Or was gonna be.

34:30.109 --> 34:31.319
Take that off.

34:34.530 --> 34:35.656
Sit down. This is gonna hurt.

34:55.802 --> 34:57.929
I guess you stitched up Ryker a lot, too?

34:59.722 --> 35:01.140
Someone had to.

35:09.690 --> 35:10.942
Where's this from?

35:12.777 --> 35:16.447
A dealer in the Mariposa district,
high on synamorphesterone.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.117
It's a male aggression enhancer.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.035
They call it Stallion.

35:24.789 --> 35:28.000
Guy killed half his family
by the time Ryker got there.

35:29.710 --> 35:32.421
This is what it took
to save the other half.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.346
What about this one?

35:43.141 --> 35:45.560
Steel-tipped boot with a toe blade.

35:46.435 --> 35:49.730
Right Hand of God martyr,
resisted arrest in New Haight.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.674
When you look in my eyes...

36:20.511 --> 36:21.888
what do you see?

36:24.891 --> 36:26.601
They're not your eyes.

36:33.149 --> 36:34.609
What about this?

36:37.403 --> 36:38.905
That one's from me.

36:39.822 --> 36:42.450
I forget why, but you deserved it.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.126
This is a mistake.

36:57.256 --> 37:00.718
When I look into his eyes,
I see you looking back at me, and...

37:03.679 --> 37:06.474
it's been a long time
since someone looked at me like that.

37:07.475 --> 37:09.227
I'm sorry I'm not Elias.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.981
Just shut the fuck up.

39:12.892 --> 39:13.934
Wake up.

39:19.231 --> 39:21.359
-Hey.
-Hey.

39:28.574 --> 39:29.742
Who's this?

39:31.077 --> 39:32.370
Mary Lou Henchy.

39:36.999 --> 39:40.544
Someone offed the CTAC
and pinned it on Ryker.

39:48.302 --> 39:51.889
BCPD! Open the door! Ryker!

39:56.394 --> 39:59.397
-Ryker, you're under arrest

39:59.480 --> 40:01.315
for the murder of Leonid Kye Harris,

40:01.399 --> 40:03.442
a senior sys op and CTAC administrator.

40:03.526 --> 40:06.404
-Kristin, stay out of this.

40:06.487 --> 40:08.823
Captain, I didn't kill anyone.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.202
Then you won't mind coming in.

40:15.579 --> 40:16.622
They got to you.

40:16.705 --> 40:18.332
-Whoa! Whoa!
-They get to everyone.

40:18.874 --> 40:20.835
-Elias...
-Nobody got to me, son.

40:20.918 --> 40:22.086
This doesn't have to happen.

40:22.169 --> 40:24.296
-Elias.
Now just put the gun down.

40:26.799 --> 40:28.050
You fucked me.

40:28.134 --> 40:31.011
Elias, put the gun down.

40:31.846 --> 40:34.014
You gonna arrest me
for doing my fucking job?

40:34.098 --> 40:37.476
Elias. Put it down. Put it down.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.438
Just... look at me. Look at me.

40:43.774 --> 40:44.859
If this is a mistake...

40:45.860 --> 40:46.902
If?

40:47.278 --> 40:49.155
-You have nothing to--

40:55.661 --> 40:56.495
If?

41:02.042 --> 41:02.877
Go.

41:07.131 --> 41:11.719
How could you not fucking believe me?
How could you not fucking believe me?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.853
Don't fucking...

41:27.443 --> 41:30.571
Mary Lou's mother came to the station.
She was...

41:31.238 --> 41:33.991
She was desperate, so...

41:35.409 --> 41:38.037
I made sure
she got Mary Lou's sleeve back.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.038
But I kept her,

41:39.121 --> 41:42.583
just in case by some fucking miracle
we get to ask her what happened to her.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.006
Look at all these people.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.761
All my answers are right here
and I just can't have them.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.596
I've got nothing.

41:56.722 --> 41:58.307
You will not be forgiven.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.558
I've seen these two before.

42:01.519 --> 42:02.686
They were murdered?

42:03.229 --> 42:04.104
Yeah.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.106
Every one of them sleeve-dead

42:06.190 --> 42:08.817
and every one of them
supposedly converted Neo-C.

42:10.027 --> 42:11.820
You believe the conversions are fake?

42:14.073 --> 42:15.199
Ryker did.

42:16.450 --> 42:18.786
-Be a hell of a market for that.
-Mmm-hmm.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.997
Except it's impossible,
like a lot of things right now.

42:23.165 --> 42:25.459
There's this man who doesn't exist.

42:25.543 --> 42:29.088
Mickey calls him the Ghostwalker.
I saw him at Bancroft's party,

42:29.171 --> 42:32.925
but somehow he wipes his image
from all recordings on the fly.

42:33.008 --> 42:33.842
How?

42:34.718 --> 42:35.636
What does it look like?

42:45.813 --> 42:47.898
I'm not sure about the mustache.

42:48.566 --> 42:52.486
This guy and Dimi are the only leads
I have left on the Mary Lou Henchy case.

42:53.529 --> 42:57.366
So you figure if he can cover his tracks,
then maybe he covered hers?

42:58.075 --> 43:01.996
Erased information on how she fell,
where she fell from?

43:02.079 --> 43:05.833
Yeah. I mean, maybe.
I need to question him.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.544
Mickey's trying to put together
an algorithm

43:08.627 --> 43:11.422
to trace the untraceable man,
but so far, no luck.

43:11.505 --> 43:14.967
Ryker's case.
Bancroft's murder. Ghostwalker.

43:17.177 --> 43:18.804
-They're connected.
-Yeah.

43:20.055 --> 43:23.017
-But they fucked up.

43:23.809 --> 43:26.103
Because they haven't killed me yet.

43:30.733 --> 43:32.693
Hey, Mickey. What you got?

43:47.082 --> 43:48.167
I take lead.

43:51.879 --> 43:55.257
You had to put me
in sleeve with a fucking hangover?

43:55.341 --> 43:57.593
Tastes like cat vomited in my mouth.

43:57.676 --> 43:58.927
I'm glad you like it.

44:03.474 --> 44:06.518
I see you grew your legs back
since we parted. That's nice.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.276
I have rights, you know.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.903
Who do you work for, Dimi?

44:15.986 --> 44:19.198
Hoping for a confession, Lieutenant?
Elias Ryker? Or whoever you are.

44:24.119 --> 44:26.538
You could be anyone.

44:26.622 --> 44:28.832
A cunning CTAC agent, huh?

44:30.376 --> 44:32.252
Oh, the crudity!

44:33.087 --> 44:35.047
This man

44:35.130 --> 44:37.633
Even a dog could be trained
to say as much as he has, given the right tranquilizers, of course.

44:40.302 --> 44:43.430
They do tend to go pitifully insane
when you decant them if not.

44:43.514 --> 44:46.225
But, yes, even a dog.

44:46.767 --> 44:49.228
She's got you cold
for double sleeving, Dimi.

44:49.311 --> 44:51.688
Limited vision.

44:53.524 --> 44:54.858
Where is the voice

44:54.942 --> 44:59.613
that said altered carbon would free us
from the cells of our flesh?

44:59.696 --> 45:03.492
The visions that said we would be angels.

45:06.120 --> 45:11.917
Instead, we became hungry for things
that reality could no longer offer.

45:12.626 --> 45:14.086
The lines blurred.

45:17.089 --> 45:19.758
You want to know who I work for?

45:21.427 --> 45:23.762
The people who understood that,

45:24.304 --> 45:27.474
who used it to become wealthy
beyond words

45:27.558 --> 45:31.770
in the only currency that truly matters:

45:31.854 --> 45:34.481
the appetites of the immortal.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.359
Just tell me who had you frame Ryker.

45:38.277 --> 45:41.363
Come on, Dimi.
Give him up, you skip real death.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.740
A hundred years in the dark instead.

45:44.700 --> 45:48.078
Oh, this is hilarious.

45:50.164 --> 45:53.041
I know police
do the real thing in virtual.

45:54.501 --> 45:56.003
There is no deal on the table.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.838
There's a fucking gun on the table!

45:57.921 --> 45:59.590
-Talk and I don't blow your stack out.
-Ortega...

45:59.673 --> 46:01.842
Know the difference
between virtual and life?

46:01.925 --> 46:03.677
Where are they?
-One's real.

46:04.720 --> 46:09.516
In a construct, you know everything
is being run by an all-powerful machine.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.895
-He's stalling.
-Reality doesn't offer the same assurance,

46:12.978 --> 46:16.064
so it's very easy
to develop the mistaken impression

46:16.148 --> 46:17.774
that you are in control.

46:17.858 --> 46:21.320
-I want a name! I want a fucking name!
-Okay. Okay.

46:21.403 --> 46:23.071
Ortega, where the hell are you?

46:24.865 --> 46:26.241
Bob.

46:27.785 --> 46:29.745
-Kill him. Blow his fuckin' stack out.
-Yeah.

46:29.828 --> 46:31.997
Ortega? This is over!

46:32.623 --> 46:34.958
Grab the Envoy.
Get this fucking guy out of here.

46:36.335 --> 46:37.920
No. Tanaka!

46:38.712 --> 46:41.423
No!
-I should not be surprised.

46:43.425 --> 46:46.386
-Tanaka, just please, let me--
-I should fire you.

46:46.470 --> 46:49.181
-He framed Ryker, God damn it!
Who is he?

46:49.264 --> 46:50.557
Dimi the Twin.
-Yeah.

46:52.017 --> 46:54.561
Are you out of your mind?
Okay.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.647
Give me five minutes in virtual,
that's all.

46:56.730 --> 46:59.024
You partnered up with an Envoy
and he played you.

46:59.107 --> 47:02.027
-I will keep my promise.
-You don't have a clue what's happening.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.278
Kovacs, shut up.

47:03.362 --> 47:05.364
Let me ride down with Dimi.

47:05.447 --> 47:07.282
A few more questions. Please.

47:07.366 --> 47:09.243
-All right. Go.
-Thank you.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.453
Not without me you don't.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.997
Get the fuck out of my station.

47:14.081 --> 47:16.583
I know what I'm doing.
You're out of control.

47:16.667 --> 47:17.626
Samir...

47:17.709 --> 47:20.796
I'm done covering for you. Never again.

47:20.879 --> 47:22.881
-Samir...
Stop.

47:24.091 --> 47:24.967
Ortega!

47:31.723 --> 47:33.100
Are you a believer?

47:58.542 --> 48:00.627
I appreciate that you are no quitter.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.130
But there is a time for letting go.

48:32.284 --> 48:34.161
We have to go.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.214
May the Lord, in his love and mercy,

48:47.215 --> 48:50.052
help you with the grace
of the Holy Spirit.

48:50.135 --> 48:53.555
You're doing this
in a fucking police precinct?

48:54.848 --> 48:57.434
May the Lord who frees you from sin...

49:02.731 --> 49:05.776
save you and raise you up.

49:17.037 --> 49:17.996
Amen.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.796
We have to go now!

49:25.879 --> 49:26.880
Come.

49:37.808 --> 49:40.644
Abboud. Abboud.

49:41.812 --> 49:42.896
Abboud.

49:45.315 --> 49:47.943
Abboud. Abboud.

50:18.306 --> 50:19.599
Help him.

50:24.604 --> 50:25.439
Help Abboud.
