[Brian] Leave me alone, will ya? You think you're so smart.

00:45.294 --> 00:47.149
[Stephen] Would you stay still already?

00:47.214 --> 00:49.069
[Stephen] What a geek!

00:49.134 --> 00:50.989
- I'm not a geek!
- You're doing it wrong!

00:51.054 --> 00:52.909
- Shut up!
- You're doing it wrong.

00:52.974 --> 00:54.917
- It doesn't go like that.
- Who asked you?

00:54.990 --> 00:57.838
- Who's your brother?
- You are, Stevie!

00:57.902 --> 01:00.357
You do it like this, it'll open up in a fire,

01:00.430 --> 01:03.430
you'll get burned and die.

01:03.503 --> 01:05.543
[Fire Bell]

01:05.615 --> 01:07.076
Let's go!

01:07.150 --> 01:09.484
What d'you got, Adcox, a big deal?

01:09.551 --> 01:11.405
Medium deal, Captain.

01:11.471 --> 01:13.740
Hey, Brian, want to come along?

01:13.807 --> 01:16.490
- Dad...
- Stephen, you've come a dozen times.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.947
Give your brother a chance. What d'you say?

01:19.022 --> 01:20.964
We'll be back in a minute. How about it?

01:21.039 --> 01:22.795
- Sure!
- Come on!

01:32.847 --> 01:35.978
- Pull the cord, Brian!

01:38.351 --> 01:41.165
[Siren]

01:52.463 --> 01:54.405
- Give it a yank, a good pull.
- [Horn Blast]

01:54.479 --> 01:56.900
You've gotta get these cars outta the way.

01:56.974 --> 01:59.243
- Give it another yank!
- [Horn Blast]

[Horn Blast]

02:17.167 --> 02:19.109
Well, there it is, right over there. See it?

02:31.598 --> 02:33.453
Okay.

02:33.518 --> 02:35.373
You stay near the truck now.

02:36.367 --> 02:38.221
That doesn't look too bad.

02:38.287 --> 02:40.588
Drop two lines and hold the squad.

02:40.655 --> 02:42.542
Everything I own in the whole world is up there.

02:42.606 --> 02:45.192
All my stuff's up there!

02:53.102 --> 02:55.949
Adcox! Ladder up!

02:56.015 --> 02:57.924
Hey, that's your old man up there, Brian.

03:20.527 --> 03:22.381
Nice grab, Captain!

03:24.430 --> 03:27.015
Take it easy. You'll be okay.

03:38.067 --> 03:40.369
We got it! Come on.

04:01.844 --> 04:03.054
Dad!

04:03.123 --> 04:06.123
Hold on, Adcox. Is that a gas line?

04:06.867 --> 04:08.656
- [Scream]
- Dad!

05:42.410 --> 05:44.712
Hey, Brian! Brian McCaffrey, got some I.D.?

05:44.778 --> 05:47.495
Hey, Willie! I'll give you I.D.!

05:47.562 --> 05:49.449
- The littlest McCaffrey!
- How you doin'?

05:49.513 --> 05:52.645
Hot off the presses, boys! Station assignments!

05:52.714 --> 05:54.601
Hey, McCaffrey! Station assignments!

05:54.665 --> 05:56.673
Why don't you hold onto that for me, huh?

05:56.746 --> 05:59.331
Something wrong with my eyesight?

05:59.402 --> 06:01.257
You really trying this fireman thing again?

06:01.322 --> 06:04.835
- Quitting once wasn't good enough?
- It's in the blood.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.761
- Is that right?
- Willie, you owe me a brew!

06:06.826 --> 06:08.735
Hold on! I'm talking to the fire chief!

06:08.809 --> 06:11.111
Let's look and see what else was in your blood.

06:11.178 --> 06:13.066
I always looked forward to getting these.

06:13.130 --> 06:17.320
- You hold onto those, huh?
- Whoa! I got station 17!

06:17.386 --> 06:21.826
"Aspen Snowmobile Tours. Brian McCaffrey, Sales."

06:21.897 --> 06:24.069
It didn't offer the growth and challenge that I needed.

06:24.138 --> 06:25.796
Uh-huh.

06:25.866 --> 06:27.906
"Cattle Drive Mobile Log Cabins."

06:27.978 --> 06:30.531
- That was in your blood six months?
- The coffee sucked.

06:30.602 --> 06:34.311
"Brian's Sound Spectrum, Direct Hi-end Stereo Sales."

06:34.377 --> 06:36.352
This is your own company. This was a big step, huh?

06:36.426 --> 06:40.681
I was ahead of my time, Willie.

06:40.745 --> 06:42.087
McCaffrey!

06:42.153 --> 06:45.001
What's the matter with you? Aren't you even curious?

06:46.953 --> 06:49.670
Engine 115, right?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.537
How'd you know, you prick? These are supposed to be sealed.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.749
Lucky guess.

06:59.818 --> 07:03.811
And a case of Scotch to the captain at station assignments.

07:03.881 --> 07:05.736
You crooked son-of-a-bitch!

07:18.985 --> 07:20.840

[Sirens]

07:52.522 --> 07:54.377
Make us proud, guys!

07:54.442 --> 07:56.297
McCaffrey, that's my cousin's company.

07:56.362 --> 07:58.217
Come on!

07:58.282 --> 08:04.960
[Speaking Lithuanian]

08:05.033 --> 08:07.750
Calm down, Mrs. Vaitkus.

08:07.818 --> 08:11.462
[Speaking Lithuanian]

08:11.530 --> 08:13.832
Mrs. Vaitkus, please, calm down.

08:13.898 --> 08:16.320
[Speaking Lithuanian]

08:16.393 --> 08:18.466
McCaffrey, I think it's a box, or a 211, at least.

08:18.538 --> 08:21.854
- Just give me one minute.
- Hurry, we can't miss this one!

08:23.977 --> 08:25.887
- Hey.
- Hi, Jen.

08:25.962 --> 08:29.278
- I see your grandma's still--
- Yeah, she still hates you.

08:32.265 --> 08:36.039
- You look great.
- Thanks, how long you been in town?

08:36.105 --> 08:37.054
Four months.

08:37.130 --> 08:39.399
- Oh, really.
- But I, uh...

08:39.466 --> 08:41.669
I've been really busy at the academy.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.039
I graduated today.

08:44.106 --> 08:46.048
I can see that.

08:46.122 --> 08:48.096
So what have you been up to?

08:48.169 --> 08:51.715
Well, uh... I work at city hall, actually.

08:51.786 --> 08:55.201
No kidding? That's great!

08:55.274 --> 08:58.372
So... I don't know what--

09:02.121 --> 09:06.180
Maybe you and I could... could get together for a beer.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.257
A beer?

09:10.345 --> 09:12.200
Beer... that's--

09:12.265 --> 09:15.462
It's funny. You're acting like I just saw you last week.

09:15.530 --> 09:18.148
When I haven't seen you in what... six years?

09:20.650 --> 09:22.505
You son-of-a-bitch!

09:22.570 --> 09:24.512
Don't want ya overheatin', Brian!

09:24.586 --> 09:26.757
I'll give you overheatin'!

09:33.162 --> 09:35.649
Easy, man. I don't have time for this bullshit.

09:35.721 --> 09:38.438
Well, you've certainly matured.

09:42.025 --> 09:44.742
Well, it's nice to know we can still be friends.

09:47.689 --> 09:51.235
Come on, Brian. We got a fire to go to.

09:52.553 --> 09:54.975
Engine 17, your pressure's fine.

09:55.050 --> 09:56.905
Get out of the way here, please.

09:56.970 --> 09:59.174
Officers, you're standing around with your thumb up your asses.

09:59.242 --> 10:01.096
- Where you going?
- I'm a fireman.

10:01.162 --> 10:02.438
Go!

10:02.505 --> 10:04.894
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

10:04.969 --> 10:06.791
Need a second lead-out?

10:06.857 --> 10:08.712
What the fuck are you talking about?

10:08.777 --> 10:10.304
- Get out of here!
- Brian!

10:12.905 --> 10:14.727
This is the real shit, man!

10:14.794 --> 10:16.648
The real thing!

11:05.034 --> 11:06.889
Well, what do we got here?

11:06.954 --> 11:08.809
A fireman's costume, huh?

11:08.874 --> 11:11.492
[Coughing] Where'd you rent it?

11:11.561 --> 11:14.496
Thanks for coming to my graduation today, brother.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.424
You're a real inspiration to me.

11:16.490 --> 11:19.653
I'm sorry, man.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.944
You're really ready to fight fire this time, huh, Brian?

11:24.009 --> 11:26.530
[Chuckle]

11:26.602 --> 11:28.609
It just doesn't work on you, little brother.

11:28.682 --> 11:31.431
- I'll see you around.
- Not likely.

11:31.498 --> 11:35.010
You see, that's where you're wrong already.

11:35.081 --> 11:37.503
I talked to Chief Fitzgerald.

11:37.578 --> 11:40.742
He decided maybe you shouldn't be way on the other side of town...

11:40.810 --> 11:42.665
where I'd never get to see you.

11:42.730 --> 11:44.585
Starting tomorrow, you're going to be...

11:44.650 --> 11:47.465
with the toughest company in the city.

11:47.530 --> 11:49.919
17... my company.

11:52.265 --> 11:54.502
One case of Scotch, Brian?

11:54.569 --> 11:56.958
Man, you're gettin' cheap in your old age.

11:57.033 --> 12:00.197
[Adcox] Get oughta here, girls.

12:00.265 --> 12:05.382
You should learn not to box when the 17's on the job.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.100
Hey, Inspector Rimgale, she's all yours.

12:52.298 --> 12:54.152
Hey, give me a shot of that, will ya?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.535
[Stephen] Hey, Shadow.

13:13.609 --> 13:15.846
So, you gotta cause there?

13:17.801 --> 13:19.724
Mice with matches.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.523
Well, the glory boys are going to have to...

13:24.588 --> 13:27.403
wait a few days on this one.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.555
[Dog Barking]

13:35.053 --> 13:36.460
Sean?

13:36.524 --> 13:37.636
Sean!

13:39.884 --> 13:42.405
Hey, buddy. What's goin' on?

13:45.292 --> 13:47.147
It's Uncle Brian.

13:48.460 --> 13:50.315
You'll remember this.

13:50.380 --> 13:52.235
Spinach?

13:52.300 --> 13:55.595
We don't need no stinkin' spinach!

13:55.660 --> 13:57.319
- Mom! Mom!
- Hey...

13:57.389 --> 13:59.461
Hey, what's--

13:59.532 --> 14:01.190
Come here. It's okay.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.944
- Hello?
- Yeah?

14:05.388 --> 14:08.203
- Brian...
- Hey, Helen.

14:08.268 --> 14:10.373
God, I'd about written you off.

14:10.444 --> 14:12.778
I know, well--

14:12.844 --> 14:14.699
So, uh... What's goin' on?

14:14.765 --> 14:16.619
- Can I come in for a second?
- Sure.

14:17.516 --> 14:19.425
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.355
Good to see you.

14:22.732 --> 14:24.554
So that's Sean, huh?

14:24.621 --> 14:26.409
Geez, he's a little giant now.

14:26.476 --> 14:30.600
You'd be surprised what a few years can do to a kid.

14:30.668 --> 14:33.570
- Remember your Uncle Brian?
- No.

14:33.644 --> 14:35.913
You don't remember him?

14:35.980 --> 14:39.941
Hey, Sean-man. Where's your daddy today?

14:43.244 --> 14:46.954
Uh... Stephen's not staying here anymore.

14:48.876 --> 14:51.014
He moved out last April.

14:54.732 --> 14:56.587
Uh... huh.

14:56.652 --> 14:58.595
I'm sorry, Helen, I uh--

14:58.668 --> 15:02.825
You guys should try picking up the phone once in a while.

15:10.252 --> 15:15.303
# [Rock]

15:15.372 --> 15:17.227
Hey!

15:19.949 --> 15:21.672
Hey.

15:21.740 --> 15:25.602
I, uh... talked to Helen.

15:29.549 --> 15:31.883
I thought Dad's boat was finally retired...

15:31.948 --> 15:33.803
to the old family graveyard.

15:36.140 --> 15:38.660
Don't you worry about falling out of this thing?

15:41.196 --> 15:43.051
I've gotta tell you,

15:43.116 --> 15:45.571
I love what you've done with the place.

15:45.644 --> 15:47.717
Yeah, it's comin' along.

15:52.844 --> 15:54.437
You want a beer?

15:54.509 --> 15:56.647
Yeah, why not?

15:56.716 --> 15:59.913
What, you been rippin' off fire stations again?

15:59.980 --> 16:01.835
Just some old stuff...

16:01.900 --> 16:04.355
that Adcox gave me that the department was gonna throw out.

16:04.428 --> 16:06.762
But it's good enough for this tub.

16:06.828 --> 16:08.421
What is this?

16:08.492 --> 16:11.176
"Iron Butterfly," "Cream"?

16:11.244 --> 16:13.895
You gotta be kidding! This isn't an actual operating 8-track!

16:13.964 --> 16:15.818
What do you want, Brian?

16:15.884 --> 16:18.055
What are you doin' here?

16:21.900 --> 16:24.453
I wanna know why you messed with my station assignment.

16:24.524 --> 16:26.727
I mean, does this really have to be...

16:26.796 --> 16:29.130
one of those big brother, little brother...

16:29.196 --> 16:31.618
you broke my G.I. Joe and I'm still pissed games?

16:31.692 --> 16:33.667
Man, how do you do it, huh?

16:33.740 --> 16:35.682
How d'you keep coming up with...

16:35.756 --> 16:37.643
new and amazing ways to fuck up?

16:37.708 --> 16:39.563
I mean, that Scotch bullshit?

16:39.628 --> 16:42.825
Am I really supposed to believe you came home...

16:42.892 --> 16:44.997
because you felt heartstrings moan for the family biz?

16:45.068 --> 16:46.923
You were bankrupt! The scary thing is...

16:46.988 --> 16:50.283
you probably coulda got away with it for awhile.

16:50.348 --> 16:52.202
Hang back a little bit at the fires--

16:52.268 --> 16:54.210
You know the drill.

16:54.284 --> 16:57.186
The only problem is, that in this job...

16:57.260 --> 16:59.148
there's just no place to hide.

16:59.212 --> 17:02.027
It's not like having a bad day selling log cabins.

17:02.092 --> 17:04.645
You have a bad day here, somebody dies.

17:04.715 --> 17:07.815
And that's just not fucking good enough.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.617
You know something?

17:12.684 --> 17:14.538
I musta told myself a million times...

17:14.604 --> 17:16.675
I didn't even want to be a damn fireman.

17:16.748 --> 17:19.236
Look, I know I quit the academy before.

17:19.308 --> 17:22.308
- And I know how you musta felt.
- Oh, you do?

17:22.380 --> 17:24.267
You know how I felt?

17:24.332 --> 17:26.665
I gotta do this, Stephen.

17:28.684 --> 17:30.539
I need to know.

17:30.604 --> 17:34.281
Yeah, I think you're going to find out, Brian.

17:37.036 --> 17:39.970
Try not to be late tomorrow, huh?

17:57.484 --> 18:00.550

18:24.171 --> 18:26.114
Oh, shit!

18:27.403 --> 18:29.738
- My car wouldn't start!
- What are you doin', man?

18:33.004 --> 18:34.859
Atta boy!

18:36.492 --> 18:38.347
Damn!

18:42.444 --> 18:44.899
Come on, man. You can make it!

18:53.964 --> 18:56.615
Well, Baby McCaffrey, how you doin'?

18:56.684 --> 18:58.440
How you doin', John?

18:59.435 --> 19:01.607
[Horn Blast]

19:01.676 --> 19:04.065
Hey, Axe, you know this rug rat?

19:04.140 --> 19:06.212
Know him? I practically raised him.

19:06.284 --> 19:09.284
He never calls. He never writes.

19:09.356 --> 19:11.243
I'm Brian.

19:11.308 --> 19:13.730
I'm sorry.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.785
[Horn Blast, Siren]

19:27.980 --> 19:30.664
All right! Garment factory.

19:30.732 --> 19:34.474
Shake and bake, boys! I think we got a barbecue.

19:34.540 --> 19:38.250
Got yourself a hot one first time out, kid.

19:38.316 --> 19:41.545
[Horn Blast, Siren]

19:53.963 --> 19:56.200
Oh, yeah, this is gonna taste like shit.

19:56.268 --> 19:58.635
- All right, let's go!
- Shit!

20:01.772 --> 20:05.733
I hate it when we gotta fucking go look for it.

20:05.804 --> 20:08.619
Call in a box, Otis. We're gonna need some back-up.

20:08.684 --> 20:10.888
Brian, inch-and-a-half.

20:10.956 --> 20:13.411
Get the high-rise jet.

20:21.452 --> 20:24.867
- These moments do try me.
- Be gentle now, Axe.

20:26.284 --> 20:27.691
[Car Alarm]

20:27.755 --> 20:29.610
Holy shit!

20:34.956 --> 20:36.811
Coming through!

20:42.796 --> 20:44.840
Heh, Probie, how about it, huh?

20:46.183 --> 20:47.077
Yo!

20:50.631 --> 20:52.486
- You ready?
- Yeah.

20:53.832 --> 20:56.253
You're doin' it wrong.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.183
Stay beside me. I mean, right beside me.

21:01.256 --> 21:03.973
Come on, man. Kick it in.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.654
Show time!

21:24.168 --> 21:25.859
Got it!

21:45.095 --> 21:48.576
- Let's take it from the side.
- No, let's hit it head-on!

21:48.647 --> 21:52.095
It's gonna flash on us, Bull. We gotta back out!

21:52.167 --> 21:54.501
She'll steam on us a little, but she won't flash.

21:54.568 --> 21:56.902
Here comes your water.

22:01.000 --> 22:02.822
Here it comes!

22:15.079 --> 22:16.902
All right, let's go for the throat!

22:31.720 --> 22:34.175
Hey, Nightengale! Save your fucking air, man.

22:34.248 --> 22:36.833
Pull down that wall!

22:38.536 --> 22:40.478
I gotta ventilate this heat.

22:51.880 --> 22:54.498
All right, hook us up to a standpipe!

22:54.567 --> 22:56.542
Come on, Brian!

23:07.111 --> 23:08.835
Shit!

23:14.535 --> 23:18.463
It's in the walls!

23:25.416 --> 23:27.270
- How about it, Probie?
- Coming!

23:29.608 --> 23:31.996
Come on, Brian. We're going to lose this!

23:32.071 --> 23:33.762
Shit!

23:35.303 --> 23:37.158
Charge it!

23:43.720 --> 23:46.403
- Hey, Otis is it--
- [Otis] It's jumpin' floors.

23:46.471 --> 23:48.326
Where's the second-in companies, huh?

23:48.391 --> 23:50.726
Sorry, man, John Wayne time. You're on your own, boss.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.541
- No back-up.
- Shit!

23:53.608 --> 23:55.974
Dig in.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.553
- Dig in, goddamn it!
- All right, come on!

24:01.383 --> 24:04.034
What the hell's goin' on? What was that, goddamn it?

24:04.103 --> 24:06.492
Slow down, it's jumpin' floors to us.

24:06.567 --> 24:09.055
Relax, put your mask on. It's gonna be the real deal.

24:19.975 --> 24:22.015
Down!

24:22.087 --> 24:24.837
Cover up, Lieutenant!

24:29.800 --> 24:31.971
Jesus Christ!

24:36.872 --> 24:38.279
I'm burning up!

24:38.344 --> 24:41.191
Put him out!

24:41.799 --> 24:42.814
Bull!

24:44.839 --> 24:47.392
All right, go get it!

24:49.448 --> 24:50.909
Hey!

24:50.983 --> 24:53.700
Sorry, kid. I thought you were dead.

24:56.007 --> 24:57.862
We got it. Let's go!

25:01.863 --> 25:03.270
Oh, shit!

25:03.335 --> 25:06.183
Man down!

25:12.519 --> 25:14.210
Look out!

25:25.863 --> 25:28.035
I'm going!

25:28.104 --> 25:30.559
You go, we go!

25:32.647 --> 25:33.989
Come on!

25:38.343 --> 25:39.685
Pull!

25:42.152 --> 25:44.006
Brian, let's go!

25:47.208 --> 25:49.062
Hey, Stephen!

25:49.128 --> 25:53.503
The chief thinks we got one left behind downstairs, a civilian.

25:53.576 --> 25:55.234
Axe!

25:56.327 --> 25:58.596
Take--

25:58.663 --> 26:00.736
[Stephen] Down to two probies, perfect!

26:00.807 --> 26:04.156
- Take Tim and do a search!
- Let's go, kid!

26:04.232 --> 26:07.134
- Stay with him.
- Okay, I will.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.728
Come on. Let's move it, Brian. Stay on this line.

26:14.599 --> 26:16.868
Ow! You son-of-a-bitch!

26:18.184 --> 26:20.038
More line!

26:31.527 --> 26:32.639
Shit!

26:32.711 --> 26:35.297
Help!

26:36.455 --> 26:38.365
Stephen! Over here!

26:38.440 --> 26:39.683
Someone's over here!

26:39.752 --> 26:42.305
Help!

26:48.296 --> 26:51.841
Where's my brother?

26:51.911 --> 26:54.300
I don't know. I ain't seen him, Bull.

26:59.111 --> 27:00.966
Is anybody in here?

27:33.160 --> 27:34.720
My God!

27:34.791 --> 27:36.798
I got one!

27:36.871 --> 27:38.726
I got one!

27:42.791 --> 27:44.646
I got one!

27:45.607 --> 27:47.462
Somebody, give me a hand!

27:50.663 --> 27:55.103
[Coughing]

27:55.175 --> 27:57.030
Is she going to be all right?

27:57.095 --> 28:00.478
I'm afraid you're a little too late with this one.

28:04.583 --> 28:08.707
[Laughter]

28:14.247 --> 28:17.116
Sorry to hear about the mannequin.

28:17.191 --> 28:20.224
I heard you two were close.

28:39.777 --> 28:41.850
You all right?

28:41.921 --> 28:44.026
You didn't get burned, did you?

28:44.097 --> 28:47.196
Look, I'm a little busy right now.

28:52.801 --> 28:55.768
You've got an awful short memory for direct orders.

28:55.841 --> 28:58.656
- I told you to stay beside me.
- I heard somebody call.

28:58.721 --> 29:00.609
What was that bullshit with the standpipe?

29:00.673 --> 29:01.883
The cap was stuck!

29:01.953 --> 29:04.888
I told you to stay right be-fucking-side me, Brian!

29:04.961 --> 29:08.376
Hey, look, I was doing it!

29:08.449 --> 29:10.904
I was up there doing it!

29:10.977 --> 29:13.049
You don't know, man. You don't know what I did!

29:13.121 --> 29:17.344
What you did was drop the ball, Probie.

29:17.409 --> 29:21.468
You split the team up. Get that part right...

29:23.745 --> 29:26.812
if you wanna.

29:45.569 --> 29:48.798
- Let me get one of those.
- Here you go.

29:50.785 --> 29:53.567
[Grindle] I don't know, Axe. I don't know.

29:53.633 --> 29:55.902
That Stephen, man.

29:55.969 --> 29:58.686
What goes through that guy's head?

29:58.753 --> 30:00.761
Never wears his mask.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.965
Making us take it on in the first room like that.

30:04.033 --> 30:07.328
This shit's happening too often, man.

30:07.393 --> 30:10.689
- Could've flashed. Should've flashed!
- Yeah, but it didn't.

30:10.753 --> 30:14.877
- Stevie knows.
- The guy's lucky.

30:14.945 --> 30:18.425
[Dispatch Radio]

30:20.289 --> 30:22.711
- Alderman.
- Inspector Rimgale.

30:22.785 --> 30:25.403
- I... need to get in that trunk.
- Oh, excuse me.

30:25.473 --> 30:27.360
Thanks.

30:30.337 --> 30:33.633
Pretty fancy shoes you're wearing for a fire scene.

30:33.697 --> 30:36.086
Guess you haven't been to many fires.

30:36.161 --> 30:38.495
We wanted to talk to you about Alan Seagrave's death.

30:38.561 --> 30:40.765
We still haven't gotten a fire report.

30:40.833 --> 30:43.419
You'll get that answer as soon as I do, ma'am.

30:43.489 --> 30:46.303
A man gets stuffed through the windshield of his own car.

30:46.369 --> 30:48.223
Is that an accident or arson?

30:48.289 --> 30:52.217
[Swayzak] People are asking me. I gotta tell 'em something.

30:52.289 --> 30:55.158
We're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case...

30:55.233 --> 30:58.975
to embarrass the alderman because of his fire department cutbacks.

30:59.041 --> 31:02.936
I have an uncomplicated job: to decide if a fire is arson.

31:03.009 --> 31:05.376
If so, to catch the son-of-a-bitch doing it.

31:05.441 --> 31:07.830
If my investigative methods happen to muck up...

31:07.905 --> 31:10.720
the campaign of certain mayor wanna-be's,

31:10.785 --> 31:12.792
I gotta tell you,

31:12.865 --> 31:15.353
I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

31:15.425 --> 31:18.686
I'm sure you're gonna have that report on my desk as soon as it's ready.

31:18.753 --> 31:20.957
- You'll have it.
- Thank you.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.078
That guy better not make any rights on reds in my district.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.047
Hey, Swayzak?

31:30.657 --> 31:32.283
You missed it.

31:32.353 --> 31:34.906
Get over there. Keep 'em busy.

31:34.977 --> 31:39.003
You should've been there. It was fucking great!

31:39.073 --> 31:42.334
We almost lost a whole goddamn company for you.

31:42.401 --> 31:46.427
Since you shut down 33, there's no fucking backup.

31:46.497 --> 31:48.471
We appreciate it. I don't know about the rest,

31:48.545 --> 31:52.342
- but you got my vote for mayor.
- If you have a problem, help us.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.806
- Work with the task force.
- The task force?

31:54.880 --> 31:58.426
Three guys have died because of cuts made by your fucking task force!

31:58.497 --> 32:02.872
Know that little glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye?

32:02.945 --> 32:05.596
That's your career dissipation light. It went into overtime.

32:05.665 --> 32:07.672
- Come on, man.
- No.

32:07.745 --> 32:10.779
If anybody's lights are about to go out,

32:10.849 --> 32:13.085
believe me, they're yours.

32:14.913 --> 32:16.855
Thanks a lot, fellas.

32:16.929 --> 32:19.318
You did a great job today, by the way.

32:19.393 --> 32:22.076
Alderman, will this affect your task force findings?

32:22.145 --> 32:24.796
No more today. Good-bye.

32:24.865 --> 32:27.734
So this is that big city job you were talking about.

32:27.809 --> 32:31.071
Yeah. Welcome home, Brian.

32:34.337 --> 32:37.120
Where's that fucking guy buy his shoes?

32:37.185 --> 32:39.934
Did you check those out? They're like fucking butter.

32:40.001 --> 32:41.975
Yoo-hoo! Hey, G-man!

32:42.049 --> 32:43.904
Get outta here.

32:46.305 --> 32:48.160
[Gargling]

32:52.129 --> 32:54.234
Do you have to do that?

32:54.305 --> 32:57.785
Yeah. Could you believe that fire?

32:57.857 --> 33:01.206
There we were, Adcox and me...

33:01.281 --> 33:05.143
pulling that lady right out of the fire's fucking throat.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.900
We saved a life, man!

33:07.969 --> 33:09.944
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

33:10.017 --> 33:12.504
I love it here! Fighting 17th!

33:12.577 --> 33:14.552
Goddamn!

33:14.625 --> 33:16.534
Stephen's amazing.

33:16.609 --> 33:19.806
You see how he took that fire? By the balls!

33:19.873 --> 33:22.906
I'm gonna be that good someday.

33:22.977 --> 33:26.043
You watch. You'll see.

33:26.113 --> 33:29.888
You know what Stephen said to me?

33:29.953 --> 33:32.342
When the shit was coming hard,

33:32.417 --> 33:35.352
he said, "You never know...

33:35.424 --> 33:38.327
till the moment the fire stares you down...

33:38.401 --> 33:41.947
- if you're just gonna do this job--"
- Or be great at it, right?

33:42.017 --> 33:45.400
He using that line of shit on you now?

33:45.473 --> 33:48.539
You think he made that little gem up?

33:48.609 --> 33:52.537
My old man used to use that line every other day.

33:52.608 --> 33:55.543
It's no line, man!

33:55.617 --> 33:57.919
That's no line.

33:57.985 --> 34:00.057
[Fire Bell]

34:00.129 --> 34:02.496
Hey, kid, we ain't waitin'!

34:03.745 --> 34:05.687
Go, go, go!

34:05.761 --> 34:10.201
Let's go! No, no, not that way!

34:10.273 --> 34:12.128
What's going on?

34:12.193 --> 34:14.047
Come on. Let's go!

34:14.112 --> 34:16.960
It's lunch, Probies! Let's get started!

34:17.025 --> 34:20.636
Ooo, caw, caw! A couple of crows, man!

34:20.705 --> 34:23.835
[TV] That money will probably end up coming from--

34:23.905 --> 34:27.549
- This better be good.
- Or we feed you to the thing.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.077
Shut up. You got something against dalmatians?

34:34.145 --> 34:35.998
[TV] Accident or murder?

34:36.063 --> 34:38.399
That's the question arson investigators are struggling with...

34:38.465 --> 34:42.010
after a freak explosion known by firefighters as a backdraft--

34:42.081 --> 34:45.592
Hey, Pengelly, you're on TV.

34:45.665 --> 34:48.795
- I saw you too!
- Look, that's me.

34:48.864 --> 34:53.304
[TV] He's been identified as Alan Seagrave, a prominent Chicago C.P.A.

34:53.377 --> 34:56.312
Despite pressure from the city council,

34:56.385 --> 34:58.773
fire officials refuse to speculate on the cause,

34:58.848 --> 35:01.183
saying only that their investigation is continuing.

35:01.249 --> 35:04.598
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.
- Here he goes again.

35:04.673 --> 35:06.582
As 17th's official toastmaster--

35:06.657 --> 35:10.072
- And bullshitter.
- Thank you, Santos.

35:10.145 --> 35:12.382
Did I mention you were cut out of my will?

35:12.448 --> 35:14.391
I think it appropriate...

35:14.464 --> 35:18.490
that we recognize the two asswipes... probationary firemen,

35:18.561 --> 35:22.073
among us today, who were officially baptized...

35:22.145 --> 35:24.283
into the world of old man fire.

35:24.353 --> 35:26.655
First, to Tim.

35:26.721 --> 35:30.070
Despite the fact he was born with a dull expression...

35:30.145 --> 35:33.309
and a really hideous pair of ears,

35:33.377 --> 35:35.613
he not only took on the beast,

35:35.680 --> 35:37.535
but pulled from its clutches,

35:37.600 --> 35:41.081
assisted by a more famous and brilliant firefighter... me,

35:41.153 --> 35:44.022
a kicking and screaming civilian...

35:44.097 --> 35:46.944
who'll probably wind up suing us for breaking her fingernails.

35:47.009 --> 35:49.212
And to Brian.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.801
Help me, Santos.

35:51.873 --> 35:55.102
[Laughter, Whistling]

35:59.617 --> 36:01.527
Whose own contribution...

36:01.600 --> 36:04.022
was both more beautiful and less likely to sue us.

36:04.097 --> 36:06.071
Son-of-a-bitch.

36:06.144 --> 36:08.697
When I heard that both McCaffrey brothers...

36:08.769 --> 36:13.406
were being assigned here at this station at the same time,

36:13.472 --> 36:17.302
my heart was filled with a... sudden desire to transfer.

36:18.945 --> 36:21.181
So raise a glass, lads,

36:21.249 --> 36:24.991
to funny-looking Tim and the McCaffrey brothers.

36:25.056 --> 36:26.966
For despite the fact...

36:27.041 --> 36:29.462
they've gotten on each other's nerves for years,

36:29.537 --> 36:32.766
have managed with great effort to still be pissed off at each other.

36:32.833 --> 36:35.254
Gentlemen...

36:35.329 --> 36:37.631
[Everybody] Fuck you!

36:39.796 --> 36:42.698

36:42.773 --> 36:46.221
#What is it good for Absolutely nothing#

36:46.292 --> 36:50.929
#Say it again, y'all War, look out#

36:50.997 --> 36:54.542

36:54.612 --> 36:57.133

36:57.204 --> 37:00.521
#I despise 'cause it means--#

37:07.380 --> 37:09.998
Thanks for the ride.

37:12.788 --> 37:15.341
Hey, Brian.

37:18.133 --> 37:20.173
I'll see you tonight, huh?

37:22.900 --> 37:25.551
Yeah, I'll see you tonight.

37:30.068 --> 37:33.199
I've known Jack Fitzgerald since he was a candidate.

37:33.268 --> 37:35.210
They had fire engines then?

37:35.284 --> 37:39.757
- Get that man's name!
- I gotta say, he was just as ugly then.

37:41.812 --> 37:43.917
Can I have a beer, please?

37:43.988 --> 37:46.956
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hey.

37:47.029 --> 37:50.957
- ...home of the real firemen.
- [Groaning]

37:51.029 --> 37:53.298
Enough of us stroking each other.

37:53.364 --> 37:55.785
Here's the man we're here to honor,

37:55.860 --> 37:59.438
- Chief Jack Fitzgerald.
- [Applause]

37:59.509 --> 38:03.338
I know I speak for everybody here.

38:03.413 --> 38:06.162
It's about time you retired...

38:06.229 --> 38:08.684
and made a promotion for somebody else.

38:08.757 --> 38:11.626
Think I oughta change the view.

38:11.700 --> 38:14.547
[Fitzgerald] I couldn't have wished for a better life.

38:14.613 --> 38:16.979
Thank you much.

38:27.124 --> 38:30.353
- I don't believe this shit!
- Pretty boy, get a load of this.

38:30.420 --> 38:33.104
Bull, wait'll you listen to this shit.

38:33.173 --> 38:35.180
- Let me see.
- Hey-hey-hey.

"Probationary Fireman, Brian McCaffrey,

38:38.325 --> 38:41.554

when he risked life and limb to...

38:44.693 --> 38:48.108
- double-check a burning floor, alone.

of a 1972 Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken...

- That's me.

39:04.916 --> 39:06.891
What are we gonna do about this?

39:06.964 --> 39:08.907
- Hey, 17, what's going on?
- Well...

39:08.980 --> 39:12.177
I think that it's union bylaw...

39:12.244 --> 39:15.473
that if you get your picture in the paper, even if it's bullshit,

39:15.540 --> 39:18.257
- you buy the whole company a drink.
- All right!

39:18.324 --> 39:22.001
I know I'm gonna have another double... on the hero!

39:22.068 --> 39:24.719
- Give him a hand over here.
- What's this?

39:24.788 --> 39:27.057

# [Irish Jig]

39:38.228 --> 39:40.083
Brian McCaffrey, huh?

39:40.148 --> 39:44.523
Brian, this is my boss, Alderman Swayzak. He wanted to meet you.

39:44.596 --> 39:46.985
You should be proud of helping to save that woman's life.

39:47.060 --> 39:49.907
- That was a hell of a job.
- Don't believe everything you read.

39:49.973 --> 39:53.104
Don't be so modest, Brian.

39:53.172 --> 39:55.561
See that?

39:55.636 --> 39:58.124
That's a mannequin.

40:08.372 --> 40:10.227
Look, Brian,

40:10.292 --> 40:13.521
let me just get down to it, okay?

40:13.588 --> 40:17.003
I've been checking you out. Jennifer can't say enough.

40:19.508 --> 40:21.548
I need your help.

40:21.620 --> 40:24.784
- I'm gonna offer you a job.
- I've already got a job.

40:24.852 --> 40:27.885
The great thing about this job, it's still with the fire department.

40:27.957 --> 40:31.404
One of your best investigators, Don Rimgale, is working a really tough case.

40:31.476 --> 40:33.811
He needs an extra pair of hands.

40:33.876 --> 40:36.397
If that name is gonna come from my office,

40:36.468 --> 40:38.573
- I want it to be you.
- Why is that?

40:38.644 --> 40:42.834
I want someone from a real traditional fire-fighting clan.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.249
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions...

40:46.324 --> 40:49.106
like dying young. Thanks anyway.

40:54.900 --> 40:59.340
Took you all of 30 seconds to blow that off.

40:59.412 --> 41:03.373
Brian, I know it's not my place to say this,

41:03.444 --> 41:07.121
but I think you're passing on a great opportunity.

41:07.188 --> 41:10.701
- You're smarter than that.
- Look, Jen.

41:10.772 --> 41:14.928
I'm trying to do something here. Can't you see that?

41:14.996 --> 41:17.135
I'm trying to be a fireman,

41:17.204 --> 41:19.692
not some kind of poster boy for Swayzak.

41:19.764 --> 41:22.797
There's gotta be at least 500 other smoke eaters here...

41:22.868 --> 41:25.585
that do that shit for real every day.

41:25.652 --> 41:28.718
Why don't you tell Swayzak to talk to one of them?

41:48.724 --> 41:52.717
#Lost the wanted driver#

Helen, can I talk to you for a minute?

42:31.188 --> 42:34.188
- What about?
- It's about Sean.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.424
Right here, right now, you wanna talk about Sean?

42:37.492 --> 42:39.947
- How you doin', Stephen?
- Hey, Jackson.

42:40.020 --> 42:43.184
You don't have to stop dancing.

42:43.252 --> 42:46.099
It's only our son, for Christ's sake.

42:46.164 --> 42:49.066
- Stephen, you don't have to remind me.
- Stephen,

42:49.140 --> 42:53.547
- what about your dumbass brother?
- Wait a second.

42:53.620 --> 42:57.875
Saving a mannequin. How fuckin' stupid can a guy get?

42:57.940 --> 43:00.907
- Stephen, relax.
- Let go.

43:02.900 --> 43:05.039
Stephen!

43:05.108 --> 43:08.424
You got anything else you want to say about my brother?

43:08.500 --> 43:10.834
Goddamn you, McCaffrey!

43:16.212 --> 43:19.060
Atta boy, Brian!

43:22.196 --> 43:24.083
Take it outside!

43:24.148 --> 43:27.825

- Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!

Ow-ow-ow. Oh, I'm bleeding.

43:35.796 --> 43:38.000

43:38.068 --> 43:40.489
Knock it off. Come on, eh?

43:40.564 --> 43:42.604
Hey! Knock it off.

43:42.676 --> 43:45.458
Hey, hey, I'm fine.

43:45.524 --> 43:47.979
Jesus, Stevie, you never know when to quit, do you?

43:48.052 --> 43:49.995
Do you ever wonder why...

43:50.068 --> 43:53.811
you're stuck a fucking lieutenant for life?

43:53.876 --> 43:56.047
No.

44:02.676 --> 44:04.847
Come on. Let's get a drink.

44:04.916 --> 44:07.055
- [Brian] You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

44:07.124 --> 44:08.946
Hey, whoa!

44:10.228 --> 44:13.644
- Get him outta here!
- I just wanna get a drink.

44:13.716 --> 44:17.197
You need to get the hell outta here. Let's go.

44:17.268 --> 44:19.685
The whole family's crazy.

44:19.812 --> 44:22.081
[Brian] You nailed him.

44:22.148 --> 44:24.090
He's all right. He said something.

44:24.164 --> 44:26.684
- What'd he say?
- I don't remember.

44:26.757 --> 44:28.698
Listen, I can walk by myself.

44:28.772 --> 44:31.456
Ow! I hurt my ankle, man.

44:31.525 --> 44:34.721
Don't stand and laugh. Get me up!

44:34.789 --> 44:38.498
Yeah. Oop. Photographer.

44:38.564 --> 44:41.859
- Think I can get on the cover of "Life"?
- Let's go.

44:41.925 --> 44:44.313
- Is Axe a great guy?
- Huh?

44:44.388 --> 44:47.356
He doesn't know shit about what I want.

44:47.428 --> 44:50.014
[Stephen] I've got news for everybody. I'm not my old man.

44:50.084 --> 44:54.754
A fire won't get me. I know more than he did.

44:54.821 --> 44:57.668
I know more about fire than all of 'em.

44:57.732 --> 45:00.799
Time for bed, Sugar Ray.

45:00.868 --> 45:02.811
Let me get those for you.

45:02.885 --> 45:05.088
Get outta my way. I can get my shoes off.

45:05.156 --> 45:07.971
You're such a pain in the ass.

45:08.036 --> 45:10.208
You always were.

45:10.277 --> 45:14.052
What are you talkin' about? I saved your ass tonight.

45:17.253 --> 45:21.377
Why don't they trust me anymore, huh, Brian?

45:21.445 --> 45:26.179
Really, the guys just don't trust me anymore.

45:35.364 --> 45:39.707
Hey, this boat could be great, don't you think?

45:42.148 --> 45:44.156
Maybe I'll just...

45:46.948 --> 45:50.593
just take it out on weekends.

45:51.620 --> 45:55.198
Sean and me.

- You did it, man.

52:33.839 --> 52:37.668
You did it all the way. You were really a hero.

52:40.590 --> 52:43.885
Brian... it's not about being a hero.

52:45.134 --> 52:47.752
I went in because there was a kid up there.

52:47.822 --> 52:52.197
I do what I do because that's my way. And it was Dad's way.

- Maybe it's not everybody's way.
- Dad's way?

52:55.758 --> 52:58.660
He tell you that in a fucking seance, huh?

52:58.734 --> 53:01.189
You said you needed to know something.

What did you learn today, huh?

53:04.334 --> 53:07.847

Oh, I don't know.

What do you think, Brian?

53:16.174 --> 53:18.727
Time to move on?

53:27.694 --> 53:29.669
You're right.

53:30.862 --> 53:34.211
You win, Stephen. You're the best.

53:39.406 --> 53:41.446
Hey, Brian?

53:50.895 --> 53:52.323
Brian.

53:52.398 --> 53:54.732
Hi.

53:54.798 --> 53:58.343
Listen, Jen, I--

53:58.414 --> 54:01.731
I've been thinking about what you said.

54:01.806 --> 54:04.741
If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.

54:08.175 --> 54:10.084
Well, great!

54:10.158 --> 54:12.841
That's great, really great news.

54:12.910 --> 54:16.685
The alderman'll be thrilled that you're working with us.

54:18.446 --> 54:20.649
Marty's a good man, Brian.

54:20.718 --> 54:23.587
Yeah.

54:48.994 --> 54:51.645
[Rimgale] So stop me if I got this wrong.

54:51.714 --> 54:54.747
The fire's almost out, you're upstairs on the unburned floor...

54:54.818 --> 54:56.989
- checkin' for heat. Correct?
- Yes, sir.

54:57.058 --> 54:59.327
- Messages for you.
- Thank you.

54:59.394 --> 55:01.303
You've been told by your battalion chief, your captain...

55:01.378 --> 55:03.931
and by me not to do nothin', right?

55:04.002 --> 55:06.107
- Do nothin' until ordered, correct?
- Yes, sir.

55:06.178 --> 55:09.178
Now the itch starts. The glory boy flash starts.

55:09.250 --> 55:11.105
"I'm a hero. Heroes don't stand around."

55:11.170 --> 55:13.242
- You can tell me. That's what it was?
- Yes, sir.

55:13.314 --> 55:16.314
So you punched out a window for ventilation.

55:16.386 --> 55:19.550
Was that before or after you noticed you were standing in a lake of gasoline?

55:19.618 --> 55:22.073
Was that before or after you noticed...

55:22.146 --> 55:25.048
you were standing in a lake of gasoline, you idiot?

55:25.122 --> 55:28.286
Before, sir.

55:28.354 --> 55:31.420
You could have burned, killed, or crispered half that company.

55:31.490 --> 55:35.768
You wrecked the physical evidence that I use to prove that it's arson.

55:35.842 --> 55:39.672
You know how goddamn hard it is to determine the cause.

55:39.746 --> 55:42.746
Now go home and you think about that.

55:45.026 --> 55:47.808
- I'll have to call him back.
- Excuse me.

55:47.875 --> 55:49.784
- Yeah?
- Brian McCaffrey, your new assistant.

55:49.858 --> 55:52.989
Oh, Dennis' kid. Why don't you go find a corner to hide in?

55:53.058 --> 55:55.294
I'll get to you later. I don't wanna deal with you now.

56:01.250 --> 56:02.526
Great.

56:24.194 --> 56:26.104
You still standing there?

56:28.354 --> 56:31.354
I think we should get something straight here now.

56:31.426 --> 56:33.281
I was assigned to this office by the city.

56:33.346 --> 56:35.518
- You better get used to me.
- I know who you were assigned by.

56:35.585 --> 56:38.236
I knew your father too. He was a hell of a fireman.

56:38.306 --> 56:40.161
He had a hell of a reputation.

56:40.226 --> 56:42.561
But it don't cut slack here as far as I'm concerned.

56:42.626 --> 56:45.822
Swayzak sends you here, fine. I gotta eat you. Those are rules.

56:45.890 --> 56:47.778
I got nothin' to say about that.

56:47.842 --> 56:50.777
Swayzak or no, you work for me now.

56:50.850 --> 56:53.271
Step outta line, make one false move, you're outta here.

56:53.346 --> 56:56.958
Don't think you're the first.

56:57.026 --> 56:59.131
- Let's go.
- Where we goin'?

56:59.202 --> 57:00.314
Pest control.

57:06.882 --> 57:10.427
#Shadow, shadow#

57:10.498 --> 57:11.927
Hi, Shadow.

57:12.002 --> 57:14.336
Hi, Ronald. How ya doin'? Stayin' comfortable?

57:14.402 --> 57:18.744
- I didn't think you would make it.
- I wouldn't miss this.

57:18.818 --> 57:20.989
- Who's that?
- He works for me.

57:21.057 --> 57:23.163
Is he a fireman? I like firemen.

57:23.234 --> 57:25.088
You like everybody, Ronald.

57:25.154 --> 57:29.431
Brian McCaffrey. Yeah, sure. No, that's Stephen.

57:31.682 --> 57:34.016
He's the little one with the hat.

57:34.082 --> 57:36.733
Oh, what a treat!

57:36.802 --> 57:40.217
- Hey, do I know you?
- Your dad did.

57:41.825 --> 57:43.833
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Nah, put it away.

57:43.906 --> 57:47.070
Come on, Shadow. He lost his dad to the animal and...

57:47.138 --> 57:50.683
you didn't even tell him who he was coming to see? Tell him.

57:50.754 --> 57:54.715
Let me tell you about Ronald. Ronald likes telephones.

57:54.786 --> 57:57.153
Likes to tape wooden matches to the bell strikers...

57:57.218 --> 58:00.033
and then wrap it in cotton with gasoline.

58:00.098 --> 58:02.968
Had a whole little thing goin', huh? And when you got bored?

58:03.042 --> 58:04.897
What'd you do?

58:04.962 --> 58:09.337
- He started makin' calls.
- Never proved.

58:09.410 --> 58:11.582
Tell him about us down on State Street.

58:11.650 --> 58:15.578
Nah. Nobody cares about that one.

58:15.650 --> 58:19.327
It was your basic warehouse torch I was doin' for the owner.

58:19.394 --> 58:22.111
I mean, they were a cakewalk. I just--

58:22.178 --> 58:26.848
I just lost my concentration and my animal turned on me.

58:26.914 --> 58:28.954
Got the whole place going like hell.

58:29.026 --> 58:32.190
My hair was on fire, my hands,

58:32.258 --> 58:34.429
everything. I was dead.

58:34.498 --> 58:36.440
Then suddenly I was alive. I was pulled out of there...

58:36.514 --> 58:39.896
by my hero, my Shadow here.

58:39.970 --> 58:42.970
Except, he didn't see this big tub of phosphorous, did you?

58:43.042 --> 58:47.232
Explosion lit him up so bright, left his shadow on the wall.

58:47.298 --> 58:50.527
Still shy about rolling up your sleeves, Shadow?

58:50.593 --> 58:52.503
Show him your stomach.

58:52.578 --> 58:56.920
The funny thing about firemen,

58:56.994 --> 58:59.198
night and day, they're always firemen.

58:59.266 --> 59:02.648
[Guard] Ronald Bartel.

59:02.721 --> 59:06.038
All right, the parole board has received...

59:06.114 --> 59:08.318
Mr. Bartel's fitness report,

59:08.386 --> 59:12.990
his I.D. 44, endorsement from his section warden.

59:13.058 --> 59:14.945
Dr. Norris?

59:15.010 --> 59:17.213
As supervising psychiatrist, I would describe...

59:17.281 --> 59:19.737
Mr. Bartel's progress as remarkable.

59:19.810 --> 59:21.719
Taking into account his disability and the six years...

59:21.794 --> 59:24.860
he's already served, I recommend a parole.

59:24.930 --> 59:27.199
Mr. Bartel,

59:27.266 --> 59:29.633
do you regret your crimes?

59:29.697 --> 59:33.691
Yes, and--

59:33.762 --> 59:38.497
and I'm aware of the pain that I have caused.

59:38.562 --> 59:40.929
If released, will you commit these crimes again?

59:40.994 --> 59:42.881
No. No, I won't.

59:42.946 --> 59:46.077
Do you consider yourself ready for society?

59:46.146 --> 59:48.033
Yes, I do.

59:48.098 --> 59:52.091
Yeah, right, Ronald. You're ready, all right.

59:52.162 --> 59:54.650
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

59:54.722 --> 59:57.721
- Shadow.
- Remember this?

59:57.793 --> 59:59.866
Remember this, Ronald?

59:59.938 --> 01:00:01.913
- Remember who it belonged to?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:01.985 --> 01:00:04.320
What did you do to that little girl?

01:00:04.386 --> 01:00:07.069
It's not fair, Shadow.

01:00:07.137 --> 01:00:09.406
What did you do to that little girl?

01:00:18.114 --> 01:00:22.336
I burned her.

01:00:22.401 --> 01:00:24.311
You burned her.

01:00:24.385 --> 01:00:28.728
What do you do to old ladies, Ronald?

01:00:28.802 --> 01:00:30.809
Burn them.

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:33.403
And what about the world, Ronald?

01:00:33.474 --> 01:00:35.994
What would you like to do with the whole world?

01:00:36.066 --> 01:00:40.703
Burn it all. [Laughing]

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.039
See ya next year, Ronald.

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:20.704
[Screams]

01:01:26.978 --> 01:01:30.273
[Lieutenant] We figured the body's the owner, some guy named Cosgrove.

01:01:30.338 --> 01:01:33.272
Weird blast, though, like that other guy...

01:01:33.345 --> 01:01:35.385
who went through the windshield of his own car.

01:01:35.457 --> 01:01:38.523
Explosion blew out the flame before the engine got here.

01:01:38.593 --> 01:01:42.172
Good for us; not too good for him.

01:01:53.090 --> 01:01:55.294
Bring the toolbox.

01:02:00.898 --> 01:02:03.036
Tim, get the hot spots.

01:02:03.105 --> 01:02:06.717
You in the cheap seats, watch it.

01:02:07.649 --> 01:02:09.078
There's Brian.

01:02:09.154 --> 01:02:12.537
Well, let's go.

01:02:12.610 --> 01:02:15.871
[Rimgale] Hey, McCaffrey, need a special invitation? Come on.

01:02:17.505 --> 01:02:19.872
Charge the line, Axe.

01:02:21.666 --> 01:02:25.659
- What do you want me to do with this?
- Shhh.

01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:28.414
We got heavy smoke stains observed in entry room.

01:02:28.481 --> 01:02:30.783
[Rimgale] Smoke demarcation line is very low.

01:02:30.849 --> 01:02:34.145
Fire never got hot enough here to cook the soot off.

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:39.862
Come on, you sneaky little son-of-a-bitch.

01:02:39.937 --> 01:02:43.286
Come on. Tell me where you came from.

01:02:43.362 --> 01:02:45.729
Point me where you started.

01:02:45.793 --> 01:02:47.833
Come on.

01:02:52.002 --> 01:02:54.424
Burn indicators distended toward northern wall.

01:02:54.498 --> 01:02:58.327
Less soot here, more heat.

01:02:58.402 --> 01:03:00.507
Lack of discoloration in shattered glass...

01:03:00.578 --> 01:03:03.000
indicates slow burn before explosion.

01:03:05.857 --> 01:03:08.279
There's some little dead rat critters here.

01:03:09.857 --> 01:03:14.200
Fire originated in this room. Took its time.

01:03:14.274 --> 01:03:16.129
Hung out.

01:03:16.194 --> 01:03:20.253
The air ran out. It couldn't breathe. It was snuffed.

01:03:20.322 --> 01:03:22.842
But it wasn't dead.

01:03:22.946 --> 01:03:25.433
Must have been all that trapped heat lying low,

01:03:25.505 --> 01:03:28.604
waiting for some sucker to give it one big gulp of air.

01:03:28.674 --> 01:03:31.543
Another backdraft.

01:03:35.617 --> 01:03:39.676
This is our point of origin. Let me have a crowbar.

01:03:46.273 --> 01:03:49.240
No sign of accelerants.

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:56.353
Well, if it's arson, somebody figured a new way to hide it.

01:03:58.465 --> 01:04:02.043
[Ricco] Okay, we got Alan Seagrave...

01:04:02.113 --> 01:04:05.561
and Donald Cosgrove.

01:04:05.632 --> 01:04:07.487
Both deaths due to close encounters...

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:10.901
with stationary objects.

01:04:10.977 --> 01:04:13.824
We have an office door for Cosgrove...

01:04:13.889 --> 01:04:16.027
and, oh, an '87 Porsche for Seagrave.

01:04:16.096 --> 01:04:19.806
No nonrelevant traumas.

01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:23.582
No significant blood toxicology.

01:04:23.649 --> 01:04:27.642
Attitude of both trajectories are consistent with explosion.

01:04:27.745 --> 01:04:30.811
They ran the residue you scraped from both front doors.

01:04:30.881 --> 01:04:33.696
It's a combination of plumber's putty and rayophene gum.

01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:35.648
It burns almost completely away when you light it.

01:04:35.713 --> 01:04:37.622
- So it was on both doors?
- Yeah.

01:04:37.697 --> 01:04:41.046
Something else I want to show you. You're gonna have to help me.

01:04:41.121 --> 01:04:44.382
McCaffrey, why don't you come over and help us?

01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:46.870
No, I don't think so. Not in my contract.

01:04:46.945 --> 01:04:49.149
I just rewrote your contract.

01:04:49.217 --> 01:04:51.519
Come on over and help us.

01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:55.163
Anyway, here, we're gonna have to lift him.

01:04:55.233 --> 01:04:58.048
Great.

01:04:58.113 --> 01:05:01.561
Christ, he's not gonna sell you insurance. Just lift him up.

01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:06.012
Hold on.

01:05:06.081 --> 01:05:08.252
You see that patch of shirt right there?

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.208
We wondered about the discoloration.

01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:12.662
So I scraped a piece off and ran a spectro on it.

01:05:12.736 --> 01:05:16.598
On a lucky shot, we picked up traces of something.

01:05:16.672 --> 01:05:18.560
What was it?

01:05:18.625 --> 01:05:21.080
Ah, trychtichlorate.

01:05:21.153 --> 01:05:23.389
[Ricco] Nobody around here ever heard of it.

01:05:23.457 --> 01:05:25.912
[Rimgale] Yeah, trychtichlorate. It eats magnesium.

01:05:25.984 --> 01:05:28.253
It's an absorption catalyst used in toxic waste accidents.

01:05:28.321 --> 01:05:30.906
It's rare. They stopped making it a couple of years ago.

01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:34.293
We figured it got in his clothes in a gas state from the fire.

01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:36.223
What was it doing in the fire?

01:05:36.288 --> 01:05:38.809
That's your job. Okay!

01:05:38.881 --> 01:05:42.230
[Gurgling]

01:05:43.744 --> 01:05:47.225
[Helen] Stephen, what-- What are you doing here?

01:05:47.296 --> 01:05:49.718
Just fixin' my roof.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:53.469
You've gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.

01:05:53.537 --> 01:05:56.220
Look, I just-- I wanted to, I don't know, not exactly...

01:05:56.288 --> 01:05:58.263
apologize for the other night, especially since...

01:05:58.337 --> 01:06:00.192
- I don't remember much.
- You remember.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:03.257
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to say, I don't know, something.

01:06:03.329 --> 01:06:06.558
The great communicator.

01:06:10.977 --> 01:06:14.839
So what's going on, Stephen?

01:06:17.537 --> 01:06:22.239
You only bang on the roof when you got something on your mind.

01:06:22.304 --> 01:06:24.573
How's Brian doing?

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.375
- He's out. He quit.
- He just up and quit for no reason?

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:32.059
I don't care what you heard, Helen, I treated him better...

01:06:32.128 --> 01:06:34.496
than any other probie I ever had. All right?

01:06:34.561 --> 01:06:36.568
He probably hates my guts...

01:06:36.641 --> 01:06:39.062
but at least he finally took a look in the mirror.

01:06:39.136 --> 01:06:41.983
So once again, Stephen's right and somebody else is wrong.

01:06:42.049 --> 01:06:43.904
You always gotta be right.

01:06:43.969 --> 01:06:46.238
- That's such bullshit.
- Yeah? Why?

01:06:46.304 --> 01:06:49.338
Because I'm the first to admit it when I'm wrong.

01:06:49.408 --> 01:06:51.263
Yeah? How often does that happen?

01:06:51.328 --> 01:06:53.303
In a fire? Never!

01:06:55.968 --> 01:06:58.423
He would have bought it, Helen.

01:06:58.497 --> 01:07:01.879
I'm telling ya, maybe not today, maybe not next year;

01:07:01.953 --> 01:07:05.269
but it would have happened. All right? He's my brother.

01:07:05.344 --> 01:07:07.231
I couldn't just--

01:07:07.296 --> 01:07:09.784
You just couldn't live with that.

01:07:14.881 --> 01:07:16.736
McCaffrey.

01:07:19.904 --> 01:07:21.791
Yeah?

01:07:23.552 --> 01:07:25.657
Take the top off.

01:07:29.441 --> 01:07:30.815
Holy shit!

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.750
That's it. That's it.

01:07:33.824 --> 01:07:37.174
Son-of-a-bitch! This guy is different. He don't love fire.

01:07:37.248 --> 01:07:38.459
- Who?
- The killer.

01:07:38.529 --> 01:07:41.212
He used magnesium to make it look like an accident.

01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:42.971
I got it after we went to see Ronald.

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:45.309
Torchers want to fry the whole goddamn world.

01:07:45.376 --> 01:07:48.671
But the fires that killed those guys never burned up that much.

01:07:48.737 --> 01:07:52.282
The trychtichlorate hid the magnesium in the plug, but it burned slow.

01:07:52.352 --> 01:07:54.360
And he made his burns backdrafts.

01:07:54.433 --> 01:07:57.880
- But he killed these guys.
- Could have killed everybody.

01:07:57.952 --> 01:08:01.018
Backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.

01:08:01.088 --> 01:08:05.049
- What reason?
- Why backdrafts.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:07.030
Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove...

01:08:07.104 --> 01:08:09.755
went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire.

01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.996
They also made sure that the fire blew itself out.

01:08:12.064 --> 01:08:14.552
So that's why they used the putty in the doors.

01:08:15.744 --> 01:08:17.599
What do we got? A torch with a conscience?

01:08:17.663 --> 01:08:21.493
No. We got a stone killer trying to make a point.

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:23.673
You can make the call now. It's arson, right?

01:08:23.745 --> 01:08:26.745
I'm not calling anyone yet.

01:08:26.816 --> 01:08:29.183
You can't rush this. I've seen it too many times before.

01:08:29.249 --> 01:08:31.801
I wanna make sure this torch doesn't walk.

01:08:31.872 --> 01:08:34.938
We're gonna wait.

01:08:35.008 --> 01:08:37.277
[Boat Horn]

01:08:39.488 --> 01:08:42.335
Well, well, Mr. McCaffrey.

01:08:42.399 --> 01:08:45.183
- Welcome aboard.
- Nice boat you got here.

01:08:45.247 --> 01:08:47.223
What? You mean mine?

01:08:47.296 --> 01:08:51.191
Well, not yet. Glad to have you as part of the team, Brian.

01:08:51.264 --> 01:08:53.850
Let's get a picture with Mr. McCaffrey and myself.

01:08:56.511 --> 01:08:59.098
You look good. Yeah, there you go.

01:08:59.169 --> 01:09:02.714
Thanks. Hi.

01:09:02.783 --> 01:09:04.923
Yeah, have fun now. Great night, isn't it?

01:09:04.992 --> 01:09:07.447
[Swayzak] Who is that?

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:10.008
- Larry Dewaay.
- Come on. Larry, how are ya?

01:09:10.081 --> 01:09:14.456
[Siren]

01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:33.151
Hey.

01:09:33.216 --> 01:09:35.934
- Yeah.
- How's the job going?

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:39.163
Okay.

01:09:39.232 --> 01:09:42.810
Yeah? ls Rimgale getting any better?

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.077
Rimgale's Rimgale. He's just doing his job.

01:09:46.145 --> 01:09:48.631
Doing his job? He hasn't done anything.

01:09:48.703 --> 01:09:51.038
At this rate, he won't declare it's arson before he retires.

01:09:51.104 --> 01:09:54.847
[Laughing And Screaming]

01:09:54.912 --> 01:09:58.425
Will you get me out of here?

01:09:58.497 --> 01:10:01.279
Otherwise I'm gonna have to go and pick her up.

01:10:05.856 --> 01:10:09.501
This is it, one of the oldest fire stations in the city.

01:10:09.568 --> 01:10:11.608
What do you think?

01:10:11.681 --> 01:10:13.536
- It's homey.
- Shhh!

01:10:13.601 --> 01:10:16.634
The guys are sleeping upstairs. You're gonna get me in trouble.

01:10:16.704 --> 01:10:20.119
This is my office. Impressive, huh?

01:10:20.192 --> 01:10:23.291
Yes, it's very nice.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.229
Lot of tradition locked up in this old house.

01:10:26.304 --> 01:10:28.191
See those doors?

01:10:28.256 --> 01:10:31.868
They lead to the hay loft when they used to have the old horse-drawn engines.

01:10:31.937 --> 01:10:35.253
Lot different then.

01:10:35.329 --> 01:10:37.696
But kind of the same, you know?

01:10:43.105 --> 01:10:45.374
Do you miss it?

01:10:47.201 --> 01:10:49.143
You seem like you do.

01:10:49.217 --> 01:10:53.046
Well,

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.975
when I came back,

01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.836
I, uh-- I knew.

01:10:58.913 --> 01:11:01.459
I knew that I really wanted to be a fireman.

01:11:01.587 --> 01:11:04.304
Then why'd you quit?

01:11:05.812 --> 01:11:10.285
I should have said I wanted to be a good one.

01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:21.361
So show me your fire truck.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.835
Shhh!

01:11:39.539 --> 01:11:42.921
[Siren]

01:11:46.932 --> 01:11:50.761
[Pengelly] Mask up, lads. Bring that sledge.

01:11:50.836 --> 01:11:55.091
[Alarm Ringing]

01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:57.992
Where is it?

01:11:58.068 --> 01:12:00.719
I don't know. There's alarms goin' off on three floors.

01:12:09.364 --> 01:12:12.015
This alarm system's been screwing up since they built--

01:12:12.083 --> 01:12:15.378
- 10? 29?
- Yeah.

01:12:26.804 --> 01:12:30.579
How do we know if the floor's gonna be on fire?

01:12:30.644 --> 01:12:32.585
Well, when the doors open,

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:34.602
if it's hot,

01:12:34.676 --> 01:12:37.294
- don't get out.
- [Snickering]

01:12:42.547 --> 01:12:45.002
We're gonna start on this side. I'll meet you down at the end.

01:12:50.419 --> 01:12:54.413
- All right, come on. Come on.
- High-rise gigs give me the creeps.

01:12:56.179 --> 01:12:58.732
Bull, we're early on this one again...

01:12:58.804 --> 01:13:01.554
and it ain't even broke out yet. We're one short with Brian gone.

01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:04.435
- Wait for the next-in engines.
- Let's catch it before it breaks out.

01:13:06.771 --> 01:13:10.001
- You want to learn something?
- Yeah, I do.

01:13:10.068 --> 01:13:12.370
Axe, go with Pengelly. Take the other side.

01:13:12.436 --> 01:13:16.113
- Don't split us up again. It ain't safe.
- I haven't got time for this.

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:20.817
- Then let me take the lead.
- Do your job; they need a line.

01:13:22.835 --> 01:13:24.723
Come on. Come on, Axe.

01:13:35.988 --> 01:13:39.566
Oh, you're so very sly; but, so am I.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.638
She's hot and smoky...

01:14:02.708 --> 01:14:04.683
but she's not rollin' yet.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.475
- [Fire Bell]
- Shit!

01:14:20.948 --> 01:14:24.690
[Dispatcher] Hello, 51. You follow 17 in the truck.

01:14:24.755 --> 01:14:28.617
[Dispatcher] 11201 South Clark. It's a cancel.

01:14:28.691 --> 01:14:31.179
[Dispatcher] 11021 South Clark.

01:14:31.251 --> 01:14:35.986
- South Clark.
- What time is it, anyway?

01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:41.616
[Siren]

01:14:44.436 --> 01:14:46.410
[Truck Horn And Siren]

01:14:52.243 --> 01:14:54.861
All right, take it.

01:15:00.147 --> 01:15:02.286
Wait, wait. Make sure you check it first.

01:15:02.355 --> 01:15:04.210
Oh, yeah.

01:15:08.691 --> 01:15:10.863
[Siren]

01:15:23.956 --> 01:15:27.272
- Howdy, boys.
- Brian!

01:15:27.348 --> 01:15:29.737
- Here we go. Now get that mask back on.
- Right.

01:15:29.812 --> 01:15:32.626
Clear!

01:15:32.691 --> 01:15:34.546
Stay here.

01:15:51.796 --> 01:15:53.835
Check that door for heat, Tim?

01:16:00.147 --> 01:16:02.001
Tim!

01:16:06.100 --> 01:16:09.166
[Screams]

01:16:15.475 --> 01:16:17.842
Watch out, Steve. I got him. Move off.

01:16:19.091 --> 01:16:22.407
Put it out!

01:16:22.483 --> 01:16:24.588
Stretcher!

01:16:24.659 --> 01:16:26.928
[Pengelly] Get the goddamn stretcher.

01:16:26.995 --> 01:16:31.272
Everybody over here. Through here. Through here.

01:16:31.347 --> 01:16:33.551
Get that stretcher over here.

01:16:33.619 --> 01:16:35.506
What the hell happened?

01:16:38.036 --> 01:16:39.978
Tim! Tim! How'd it happen?

01:16:40.052 --> 01:16:42.223
Breathe, Tim, breathe.

01:16:44.148 --> 01:16:45.806
Get him in there!

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:48.079
Come on!

01:16:48.147 --> 01:16:51.442
- You're all right.
- Come on! Hang on, kid!

01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:33.389
- Hey, Shadow, I got one here.
- Oh, Christ.

01:17:35.412 --> 01:17:37.266
Some guy named Holcomb.

01:17:42.452 --> 01:17:45.103
Steve.

01:17:45.171 --> 01:17:47.593
[Pengelly] Steve.

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:49.642
Steve, you all right?

01:18:09.332 --> 01:18:12.496
- How is he?
- He's alive.

01:18:18.195 --> 01:18:21.511
- Is he gonna make it?
- They're not saying.

01:18:22.995 --> 01:18:24.850
He's in there.

01:18:26.931 --> 01:18:28.786
I'm sorry. You can't come in now.

01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:30.760
Please stay outside.

01:18:34.996 --> 01:18:36.883
I should have been there.

01:18:36.947 --> 01:18:38.736
None of us should have been there, Brian.

01:18:41.683 --> 01:18:43.657
Don't tell me about the chance I'm taking.

01:18:43.731 --> 01:18:45.836
- You were costing me time.
- You didn't wait for back-up.

01:18:45.907 --> 01:18:49.485
- You were wrong.
- What the hell is your trouble?

01:18:51.891 --> 01:18:53.865
- This part of your investigation?
- You had to do it.

01:18:53.939 --> 01:18:56.111
You had to be myth man, taking another fire bare-handed...

01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:58.219
- instead of looking out for the probie.
- We need space.

01:18:58.291 --> 01:19:00.975
- Is that what happened?
- I had that fire. He didn't listen.

01:19:01.042 --> 01:19:03.115
He's a candidate, your responsibility.

01:19:03.187 --> 01:19:05.042
You shouldn't have had him up there in the first place.

01:19:05.107 --> 01:19:06.995
You burned him, Stephen.

01:19:07.059 --> 01:19:09.928
- Fuck you.
- Don't you walk away from me.

01:19:22.739 --> 01:19:24.627
Yo, Brian. Let's go.

01:19:24.691 --> 01:19:27.593
Goddamn it! Get him off!

01:19:27.667 --> 01:19:29.936
Come on!

01:19:30.003 --> 01:19:31.563
Easy, man.

01:19:31.636 --> 01:19:33.522
Loosen up! You're just making things worse.

01:19:33.587 --> 01:19:35.529
- Relax. Forget about it.
- Come on. Come on.

01:20:01.933 --> 01:20:05.315
- Inspector.
- Alderman.

01:20:10.797 --> 01:20:12.651
Chinese sponge cake?

01:20:12.717 --> 01:20:15.083
When are you gonna catch the prick that's doing this, Don?

01:20:15.149 --> 01:20:18.116
- Don?
- Don't you have any leads?

01:20:18.188 --> 01:20:20.643
No, Marty, I don't.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:23.399
We haven't found any connection between the victims at all.

01:20:23.469 --> 01:20:26.884
Jesus Christ. Open your eyes.

01:20:26.957 --> 01:20:28.931
You got Seagrave, Cosgrove...

01:20:29.004 --> 01:20:31.241
- and now Holcomb.
- Holcomb?

01:20:31.309 --> 01:20:34.375
Put 'em together. It's a goddamn list.

01:20:34.445 --> 01:20:36.299
I didn't know the name of that victim had been released?

01:20:53.708 --> 01:20:55.563
Hey, John.

01:20:55.628 --> 01:20:57.483
[Fireman] Morning.

01:21:00.172 --> 01:21:03.238
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

01:21:06.156 --> 01:21:09.571
I want to help you nail that son-of-a-bitch that burned Tim.

01:21:09.645 --> 01:21:13.060
Show me how.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:25.512
Thought old Marty was acting a little strange.

01:21:25.581 --> 01:21:30.152
He's right. There's residue.

01:21:30.221 --> 01:21:32.522
Holcomb is the third victim.

01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:37.544
The backdraft was set up somewhere in there.

01:21:37.612 --> 01:21:39.881
Fried Holcomb when he opened the inner door.

01:21:42.220 --> 01:21:44.554
But the outer door held and it waited for Tim.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:50.789
In a word, Brian,

01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:53.282
what is this job all about?

01:21:53.356 --> 01:21:54.949
Fire.

01:22:11.597 --> 01:22:13.702
It's a living thing, Brian.

01:22:13.773 --> 01:22:17.155
It breathes, it eats,

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:19.137
and it hates.

01:22:19.212 --> 01:22:22.595
The only way to beat it...

01:22:22.668 --> 01:22:25.090
is to think like it;

01:22:25.164 --> 01:22:28.295
to know this flame will spread this way across the door...

01:22:28.364 --> 01:22:30.219
and up across the ceiling;

01:22:30.284 --> 01:22:32.619
not because of the physics of flammable liquids,

01:22:32.684 --> 01:22:35.367
but because it wants to.

01:22:35.437 --> 01:22:39.747
Some guys, fire owns 'em. Makes 'em fight it on its level.

01:22:39.820 --> 01:22:43.268
The only way to truly kill it...

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:47.367
is to love it a little, just like Ronald.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:05.348
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:23:05.421 --> 01:23:09.479
- I heard your friend's gonna be okay.
- Thanks.

01:23:09.548 --> 01:23:11.556
We checked and your boss was partners...

01:23:11.628 --> 01:23:14.531
with all the murder victims in a company called Lakeside Dynamics.

01:23:14.604 --> 01:23:18.052
He's keeping that a secret. I wanna know why.

01:23:21.708 --> 01:23:26.148
- I don't know anything about that.
- You might be able to find out.

01:23:26.221 --> 01:23:29.701
- Get me his files.
- Do you know what you're asking?

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:31.049
Yeah.

01:23:31.116 --> 01:23:34.313
Four years ago I was punching a cash register.

01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:36.801
Two years ago, Marty Swayzak didn't even know my name.

01:23:36.876 --> 01:23:38.731
I was bringing the guy coffee.

01:23:38.796 --> 01:23:41.218
I practically run that office now.

01:23:41.292 --> 01:23:44.708
And Marty-- He believes in me.

01:23:44.781 --> 01:23:47.202
I just don't--

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:51.051
You're asking me to throw that all away.

01:23:51.116 --> 01:23:53.505
Your boss is a liar.

01:24:13.964 --> 01:24:17.739
Stephen?

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:21.481
I'm sorry, Helen. I just couldn't sleep.

01:24:24.749 --> 01:24:27.334
Well, what's wrong?

01:24:27.404 --> 01:24:30.251
It used to be real clear.

01:24:30.316 --> 01:24:32.170
When I was a kid,

01:24:34.444 --> 01:24:37.893
what meant most to me about this job was...

01:24:37.964 --> 01:24:40.266
no "ifs."

01:24:40.332 --> 01:24:43.627
Somebody called the fire department, we came.

01:24:43.692 --> 01:24:46.376
We just showed up.

01:24:50.572 --> 01:24:53.354
Those guys, they just don't know how much I love 'em.

01:24:59.276 --> 01:25:02.124
You don't leave people hangin'.

01:25:05.421 --> 01:25:08.355
It holds everything up, doesn't it?

01:25:08.428 --> 01:25:11.330
Loyalty.

01:25:11.404 --> 01:25:13.313
I don't get it.

01:25:13.388 --> 01:25:17.163
"Till death do us part." Isn't that what you heard, Helen?

01:25:17.229 --> 01:25:20.392
You go, we go. It's all the same...

01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:22.402
piece of shit without that, isn't it?

01:25:22.476 --> 01:25:26.535
It's the end of everything.

01:25:32.044 --> 01:25:34.946
I'm sorry I came.

01:25:37.036 --> 01:25:39.906
There's just nobody I can talk to.

01:25:44.621 --> 01:25:48.417
I really miss you.

01:26:32.556 --> 01:26:37.062
[Stephen] You sure you really want to put grape jelly in the eggs?

01:26:37.132 --> 01:26:40.547
Yeah, it's part of my formula. It's an experiment.

01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:42.507
- It's an experiment?
- Yeah.

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:44.427
Let's get these eggs going.

01:26:44.492 --> 01:26:46.467
- Hey, I want to do that.
- Can you do it?

01:26:46.540 --> 01:26:50.282
That's good.

01:26:52.268 --> 01:26:54.952
I'll put that in the formula.

01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:57.027
- You gonna leave the shells?
- Yeah.

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:00.067
- They're part of the formula?
- Yeah.

01:27:00.140 --> 01:27:03.456
I guess you know what you're doing.

01:27:03.532 --> 01:27:07.242
- I know what I'm doing.
- Uh-oh.

01:27:07.308 --> 01:27:09.163
Mom!

01:27:09.228 --> 01:27:11.748
I didn't know you'd be up so early.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:15.268
Mom, go back to bed. We're making you breakfast in bed.

01:27:20.939 --> 01:27:23.493
- Stephen, can I talk to you a minute?
- Yeah.

01:27:23.564 --> 01:27:26.019
You keep going there. You're doing good.

01:27:26.091 --> 01:27:27.978
He knows what he's doin'.

01:27:28.104 --> 01:27:32.229
He told me he likes those piano lessons you got him taking.

01:27:32.297 --> 01:27:35.875
It's just I don't want to confuse him, you know.

01:27:35.945 --> 01:27:39.839
I knew who you were when we got married.

01:27:39.913 --> 01:27:42.018
I knew how you did things.

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.280
And--

01:27:47.337 --> 01:27:50.632
I mean, you haven't--

01:27:50.697 --> 01:27:52.802
I just can't anymore.

01:27:52.873 --> 01:27:55.840
I just-- you know,

01:27:55.913 --> 01:27:59.972
I gotta worry about Sean.

01:28:00.041 --> 01:28:02.823
- Yeah.
- I mean, you're the best.

01:28:02.889 --> 01:28:05.158
You really are.

01:28:05.225 --> 01:28:09.055
But the chances that you take just--

01:28:11.561 --> 01:28:13.448
You scare me now.

01:28:21.961 --> 01:28:24.001
Sean.

01:28:24.073 --> 01:28:26.626
Listen, I, uh--

01:28:26.697 --> 01:28:28.584
I blew it.

01:28:28.649 --> 01:28:31.169
I forgot that I gotta work this morning.

01:28:31.241 --> 01:28:34.056
So, um--

01:28:34.121 --> 01:28:36.936
That's all right. We'll just do it again next Saturday.

01:28:37.001 --> 01:28:39.684
- All right?
- Mom's crying.

01:28:53.193 --> 01:28:56.259
The latest polls came in, Marty.

01:29:00.873 --> 01:29:02.728
Marty?

01:29:11.528 --> 01:29:13.383
Jesus Christ, Marty.

01:29:13.448 --> 01:29:16.929
What's going on?

01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.197
We have a city planners meeting in 15 minutes.

01:29:20.266 --> 01:29:23.200
Marty.

01:29:28.712 --> 01:29:32.607
You've gotta level with me, Marty.

01:29:32.681 --> 01:29:36.478
Is there something about these deaths you're not telling me?

01:29:36.553 --> 01:29:40.579
No.

01:30:03.081 --> 01:30:06.376
- What's this?
- Just take it.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.362
Rimgale's gonna wanna talk to Swayzak about this.

01:30:27.433 --> 01:30:31.142
I'm sorry.

01:30:31.208 --> 01:30:34.754
That's a dumb thing to say.

01:30:34.825 --> 01:30:37.246
You're right.

01:30:37.321 --> 01:30:41.380
Good-bye, Brian.

01:30:46.985 --> 01:30:49.472
What the hell you do with this thing?

01:30:49.545 --> 01:30:51.618
What do you mean? I drove it, Joe.

01:30:51.688 --> 01:30:54.503
This is a copy of Swayzak's report that we know is bullshit;

01:30:54.568 --> 01:30:57.536
but we could never argue with the numbers because they're airtight.

01:30:57.609 --> 01:31:00.326
This file she gave you proves it's phoney.

01:31:00.393 --> 01:31:03.709
I checked on the firm that recommended the cuts to Swayzak's task force.

01:31:03.785 --> 01:31:06.054
They've done exactly one job, a manpower study.

01:31:06.122 --> 01:31:08.936
I checked further and it's not even a company. No employees... nothing.

01:31:09.001 --> 01:31:12.449
- Just a P.O. box.
- I wonder who wrote that report.

01:31:12.521 --> 01:31:15.555
- Someone who knows how to work numbers.
- Exactly.

01:31:15.624 --> 01:31:19.137
Like a bunch of dead financial wizards.

01:31:19.208 --> 01:31:22.885
- Seagrave, Holcomb, Cosgrove--
- And Swayzak.

01:31:22.953 --> 01:31:25.952
Why did he go through this trouble to cut firehouses?

01:31:26.025 --> 01:31:29.320
When a firehouse closes, Swayzak converts it into a community center.

01:31:29.385 --> 01:31:31.905
- That's sweet.
- Lakeside Dynamics, remember them?

01:31:31.977 --> 01:31:34.181
They get all the expensive construction work.

01:31:34.249 --> 01:31:36.551
I'm telling you, this is a total scam.

01:31:36.617 --> 01:31:39.650
These guys were making a ton of money.

01:31:39.721 --> 01:31:44.628
It's time we had a little talk with Mr. Swayzak. Let's go.

01:32:02.739 --> 01:32:04.976
Mr. Swayzak?

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.852
Gas. Check in there.

01:32:14.483 --> 01:32:17.550
[Hissing]

01:32:29.619 --> 01:32:31.474
Aaah!

01:32:33.363 --> 01:32:36.430
[Screaming]

01:32:54.516 --> 01:32:56.523
Come on. Come on!

01:33:11.155 --> 01:33:13.905
- Let's go. Come on!
- [Coughing]

01:33:36.436 --> 01:33:40.396
- [Coughing]
- Hey, kid.

01:33:40.467 --> 01:33:42.409
I think I've got a problem here.

01:33:50.356 --> 01:33:53.487
Is it true that you were rescued by the fire department's arson team?

01:33:53.555 --> 01:33:55.922
That's quite a bunch of guys, huh?

01:33:58.355 --> 01:34:01.389
I'm so goddamn helpless here.

01:34:01.459 --> 01:34:03.532
I can't do a fucking thing.

01:34:03.604 --> 01:34:06.734
[Sighs]

01:34:06.804 --> 01:34:10.994
- What do you want me to do?
- I've been lying here thinkin'.

01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:15.794
For hours... thinkin' and thinkin' and thinkin'.

01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:19.405
We're close. We're close.

01:34:19.475 --> 01:34:21.330
But we're not lookin' in the right place,

01:34:21.395 --> 01:34:23.250
not in the right place.

01:34:26.515 --> 01:34:31.338
So, you've come to pick Ronald's brains...

01:34:31.411 --> 01:34:35.470
because nobody knows the animal like Ronald.

01:34:42.099 --> 01:34:44.750
It must've looked like it was going to be...

01:34:44.820 --> 01:34:48.398
a medium deal, didn't it, when your father bought it?

01:34:48.467 --> 01:34:50.704
What?

01:34:50.771 --> 01:34:56.238
Did you watch him when he made that ballsy jump and saved--

01:34:56.307 --> 01:34:58.379
I didn't come to talk about my father.

01:34:58.452 --> 01:35:01.648
I sent away for a copy of that "Life Magazine"...

01:35:01.715 --> 01:35:04.530
with your picture on the cover.

01:35:04.595 --> 01:35:06.864
It's a collectible.

01:35:06.931 --> 01:35:09.899
- Who's doing this, Ronald?
- Wrong question.

01:35:09.971 --> 01:35:12.306
Who isn't?

01:35:12.371 --> 01:35:14.378
It isn't a spark, is it? Because there isn't enough damage...

01:35:14.452 --> 01:35:16.720
and he wouldn't have had any fun.

01:35:16.788 --> 01:35:20.465
It isn't an insurance pro because there isn't any profit.

01:35:20.532 --> 01:35:22.920
- Who does that leave us with?
- What's his tool?

01:35:22.995 --> 01:35:26.792
How does he do it? How does he talk to the fire?

01:35:26.867 --> 01:35:30.282
- The outlets.
- No.

01:35:30.355 --> 01:35:33.486
That's a probie. That's beneath you, Brian.

01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:39.598
Trychtichlorate.

01:35:39.667 --> 01:35:43.050
Very good. Very good.

01:35:43.124 --> 01:35:47.280
You still haven't put it together?

01:35:47.347 --> 01:35:49.486
- I have.
- Then who, Ronald?

01:35:49.555 --> 01:35:53.516
You wanna know who?

01:35:55.540 --> 01:35:58.703
I wanna know...

01:35:58.771 --> 01:36:02.699
if this kid really wanted to be...

01:36:02.771 --> 01:36:04.876
just like his dad.

01:36:09.043 --> 01:36:12.109
Did he?

01:36:16.724 --> 01:36:18.578
Okay.

01:36:18.644 --> 01:36:21.033
I'm outta here.

01:36:21.107 --> 01:36:25.036
All right! I wanted to be him, okay?

01:36:31.028 --> 01:36:33.166
I wanted to be him more than anything.

01:36:33.235 --> 01:36:35.504
You loved him.

01:36:35.572 --> 01:36:38.768
Yeah.

01:36:38.835 --> 01:36:43.243
You watched him dance with the animal. You saw your dad burn.

01:36:43.315 --> 01:36:46.544
Fuck you, Ronald! Who the hell's doin' this?

01:36:46.611 --> 01:36:49.546
Did it look at you?

01:36:51.507 --> 01:36:53.678
[Whispering] Did the fire look at you?

01:36:56.436 --> 01:36:59.337
It did.

01:37:08.883 --> 01:37:10.738
Ohhh.

01:37:16.115 --> 01:37:20.271
Our worlds aren't that far apart, are they?

01:37:20.339 --> 01:37:23.122
So...

01:37:23.187 --> 01:37:28.522
whoever did this, really knows the animal well, don't they?

01:37:28.595 --> 01:37:32.076
They know him real well but they won't let him loose.

01:37:32.147 --> 01:37:34.481
They won't let him have fun so they don't love him.

01:37:34.547 --> 01:37:37.198
Who doesn't love fire...

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:40.715
and is around trychtichlorate all day long?

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:43.504
Oh, my God!

01:37:48.467 --> 01:37:52.144
That wasn't such a long walk after all, was it?

01:38:05.012 --> 01:38:07.663
Oh, God.

01:38:07.731 --> 01:38:12.336
Goddamn it, Stephen.

01:38:12.403 --> 01:38:15.021
[Door Shutting]

01:38:20.179 --> 01:38:24.914
Hey, what's goin' on?

01:38:24.979 --> 01:38:29.419
I just came by to see how you were doing?

01:38:30.387 --> 01:38:33.485
How am I doin'?

01:38:33.556 --> 01:38:36.938
Well, I'm sellin' Dad's boat.

01:38:39.668 --> 01:38:43.377
Guy comin' by in a few minutes to take a look at it.

01:38:45.299 --> 01:38:47.154
What are you gonna do?

01:38:47.219 --> 01:38:50.568
I mean, where you going?

01:38:53.523 --> 01:38:56.425
I didn't say I was goin' anywhere.

01:38:58.899 --> 01:39:00.972
Look, I gotta-- I gotta get back.

01:39:01.044 --> 01:39:03.531
- There's somethin' I'm supposed to do.
- What?

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:06.287
What do you gotta do?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.866
Look at you.

01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:15.154
Look at your face! All the things you must be thinkin'.

01:39:15.219 --> 01:39:18.765
You really hate my guts, don't you?

01:39:18.835 --> 01:39:22.250
You know something, Brian? That's all right.

01:39:22.323 --> 01:39:24.625
- Maybe we should talk abou--
- You don't like me...

01:39:24.691 --> 01:39:27.758
because I was no genius in the way I raised you. Is that it?

01:39:27.827 --> 01:39:30.827
Dad was gone! What was I supposed to do?

01:39:30.899 --> 01:39:33.649
- You tell me.
- Forget it. It's okay.

01:39:33.715 --> 01:39:36.912
I tried. I wanted so many things for you...

01:39:36.979 --> 01:39:39.793
that I couldn't even hope for.

01:39:39.859 --> 01:39:43.568
Because after that, I had no choices!

02:05:55.594 --> 02:05:57.863
#Maybe something mattered#

02:05:57.931 --> 02:05:59.873
#It's not just for you#

02:05:59.946 --> 02:06:02.368
#Some are gonna go for broke#

02:06:02.443 --> 02:06:04.810
#Some will lay down#

02:06:04.875 --> 02:06:09.348
#I've been too long standing still#

02:06:09.419 --> 02:06:14.470
#All I know is whenever you need me#

02:06:14.538 --> 02:06:20.255
#You reach out and set me in motion#

02:06:29.835 --> 02:06:34.275
#Lookin' out on that lonely valley#

02:06:34.346 --> 02:06:39.431
#You're tellin' me I've come so far#

02:06:39.498 --> 02:06:44.103
#You're the reason I finally got there#

02:06:44.170 --> 02:06:49.091
#You're the reason it's been so hard#

02:06:49.162 --> 02:06:51.813
#Been livin' in the shadows#

02:06:51.882 --> 02:06:54.337
#Now you hear the call#

02:06:54.410 --> 02:06:56.614
#Now you're in the saddle#

02:06:56.682 --> 02:06:59.049
#You got to ride or fall#

02:06:59.114 --> 02:07:01.602
#Now you push a little harder#

02:07:01.675 --> 02:07:04.009
#Like I showed you to#

02:07:04.074 --> 02:07:08.449
#'Cause the day'll be comin' they will look to you#

02:07:08.522 --> 02:07:10.694
#Some are gonna go for broke#

02:07:10.763 --> 02:07:13.218
#Some will lay down#

02:07:13.291 --> 02:07:17.960
#I've been too long standing still#

02:07:18.027 --> 02:07:22.980
#All I know is whenever you need me#

02:07:23.050 --> 02:07:28.287
#You reach out and set me in motion#

02:07:47.339 --> 02:07:49.892
#Some are gonna go for broke#

02:07:49.962 --> 02:07:52.352
#Some will lay down#

02:07:52.426 --> 02:07:57.282
#I've been too long standing still#

02:07:57.355 --> 02:08:02.145
#All I know is whenever you need me#

02:08:02.218 --> 02:08:06.975
#You reach out and set me in motion#

02:08:07.051 --> 02:08:09.440
#Some are gonna go for broke#

02:08:09.515 --> 02:08:12.035
#Some will lay down#

02:08:12.106 --> 02:08:16.776
#I've been too long standing still#

02:08:16.842 --> 02:08:21.632
#I will pick you up whenever you stumble#

02:08:21.707 --> 02:08:27.751
#You reach out and set me in motion#
