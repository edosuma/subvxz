Frankie, what are we doing here?

00:55.972 --> 01:00.101
What's it look like? We're taking
fat rips off my new toilet bong.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.771
Yes, but what are we really doing?

01:02.854 --> 01:05.815
JM, this is a classic invention pivot.

01:06.191 --> 01:11.279
Did you know that Tesla started
as a robot girlfriend for Elon Musk?

01:11.362 --> 01:13.073
And this has nothing to do

01:13.156 --> 01:15.658
with what happened with Grace
on <i>Shark Tank?</i>

01:16.201 --> 01:20.038
I've already forgotten
about Grace's unforgivable betrayal.

01:20.830 --> 01:23.917
I'm a toilet disruptor now.
Get the lighter.

01:24.167 --> 01:30.340
Frankie, you are literally setting fire
to the thing that you and Grace made.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.342
Do you want to get fucked up or not?

01:33.301 --> 01:35.095
Let's fire this baby up.

Well, old friend, this is why
you're my new best friend.

Hey, don't bogart that toilet. Let me...

[Frankie coughs slightly]

01:55.990 --> 01:57.117

01:57.200 --> 01:58.243
I've got the munchies.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.161
Oh, it's a little quick
to get the munchies.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.038
Well, I was starving before I got here.

02:02.413 --> 02:03.706
I could eat.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.833
[both chuckle]

02:05.792 --> 02:08.086
Oh, my God. We could go anywhere we want.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.630
Grace would never go out with me
after I smoked.

02:10.713 --> 02:13.216
She always got real paranoid
when I was high.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.635
[gasps] What about that place

02:15.718 --> 02:18.847
where they dump the seafood
right on the tables?

02:18.930 --> 02:21.683
Oh, perfect.
It'll make up for all the times

02:21.766 --> 02:24.435
Grace wouldn't let me eat chili
off the counter.

-But I'm too wasted to drive.

[chuckles]

02:37.740 --> 02:39.284
-Hey.
-Hello.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.787
So, how'd it go on <i>Shark Tank?</i>

02:42.871 --> 02:43.746
Not well.

02:44.372 --> 02:47.125
The only offer we got was from Mark Cuban.

02:47.625 --> 02:48.459
You're kidding me.

02:48.543 --> 02:49.544
[scoffs]

02:50.461 --> 02:51.296
And?

02:51.379 --> 02:53.381
Well, I... I didn't make the deal.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.925
And Frankie may never speak to me again.

02:56.009 --> 02:56.968
Oh.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.303
I'm sorry.

02:58.386 --> 03:02.557
[exhales] I need more than that.
I-I-I need to know this was worth it.

03:03.349 --> 03:05.810
What on Earth did Cuban do to you?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.395
Oh. [exhales]

03:07.478 --> 03:09.314
-It's complicated.
-Simplify it.

03:09.939 --> 03:11.524
He bought a basketball team.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.152
-Complicate it.
-It was the Mavericks.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.947
And what terrible thing
did he do to you to get them?

03:18.031 --> 03:20.116
He outbid me! Publicly!

03:21.451 --> 03:22.869
-What?
-Yeah.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.370
[grunts loudly]

03:24.787 --> 03:26.581
I can do it myself!

03:26.664 --> 03:30.919
Don't tell me I sold out my best friend
for a basketball team!

03:31.002 --> 03:32.879
No, it's not just that!

03:34.964 --> 03:36.925
He's got more money than me!

I do my thing, you do your thing.

our honeymoon money.

bad to the bone!

-Nailed him.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.301
Uh, Barry is back
from his backwoods emotional journey,

05:01.384 --> 05:04.721
and he is ready to punish you
with his feelings.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.057
Okay, that's my cue. Good luck.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.643
Why? There's not gonna be a fight.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.729
As soon as I tell him
I turned down the job,

05:12.812 --> 05:16.316
he'll be back to being
my beautiful beta Barry.

Can we have the room, please?

05:28.286 --> 05:29.662
-[Adam clears throat]
-Yeah.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.749
Okay. Before you say anything,

05:32.832 --> 05:36.085
you should know that I turned down
the San Francisco job

05:36.169 --> 05:38.713
because I consider you...

05:39.630 --> 05:40.923
above all things.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.800
I think you should take the job.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.137
I mean, you'd be--
you'd be great at it. [chuckles]

05:46.721 --> 05:48.097
This feels like a trap.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.433
No, no, no. It's-It's not.
It's not a trap.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.809
I... [inhales]

05:51.893 --> 05:55.063
[exhales] Look, I realized something
from my journaling.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.065
[exhales]

05:57.148 --> 05:58.149
This is all my fault.

05:58.232 --> 05:59.734
Oh, thank God.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.199
Wait. Was that a decoy trap,
and this is the real trap?

06:06.282 --> 06:08.242
You've always been
completely clear with me.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.869
You don't want any kind
of commitment.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.163
I never said "any."
We bought a mattress together.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.623
That has a seven-year guarantee.

06:13.706 --> 06:15.333
I think I need more than a mattress.

06:15.416 --> 06:16.334
Fine.

06:17.085 --> 06:18.544
We can get a memory foam topper.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.673
I don't think we...

06:25.093 --> 06:26.719
can be "we" anymore.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.806
You're breaking up with me?

06:31.432 --> 06:33.518
I think it's best for both of us
in the long run.

06:33.601 --> 06:34.769
Well, I disagree.

06:36.104 --> 06:38.147
And don't I have a say in this?

06:39.982 --> 06:41.317
You've had your say.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.654
I just haven't been listening.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.032
[Barry exhales]

06:50.326 --> 06:52.495
I better go before one of us cries.

[Barry exhales]

07:00.503 --> 07:01.504

07:02.004 --> 07:03.631
Who am I kidding? It's gonna be me.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.347
I'm sorry.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.603
[indistinct restaurant chatter]

07:17.687 --> 07:22.150
You know, people have shells, too.

07:22.817 --> 07:25.778
Only ours are on the inside.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.322
I was thinking the exact same thing.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.909
I mean, it would be nice to have
an outer shell sometimes.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.787
But I guess that's what raincoats are for.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.581
This is unbelievable!

07:36.664 --> 07:39.417
It's like we have one mind,
but two accents.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.418
[laughs]

07:40.501 --> 07:42.336
I'm paying for dinner, JM.

07:42.420 --> 07:45.465
No, no, no, you pay. I insist.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
[both laughing]

07:53.264 --> 07:55.516
Oh, no. I forgot my purse.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.726
Oh, dear.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.687
You forgot mine, too.

08:00.521 --> 08:01.439
Uh-oh.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.526
Frankie, I think we're at that point
in our misadventures

08:05.610 --> 08:07.904
where we usually call Grace to save us.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.532
Well, that's not happening,
because I'm not speaking to her.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.326
Oh.

08:13.409 --> 08:15.328
And I left my phone at home.

08:15.411 --> 08:17.079
[scoffs] Great.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.082
And you left mine, too.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.584
[both laughing]

08:23.586 --> 08:27.632
Well, no worries. We'll just borrow one
and call somebody else.

08:28.049 --> 08:31.594
Oh, I-I can't remember
anyone's number anymore.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.888
Except my lawyer's.

08:33.971 --> 08:37.016
Uh, 1-800-ACCIDENTES.

08:37.099 --> 08:40.937
It's okay, I just need to flip
through my mental Rolodex.

08:41.020 --> 08:41.979
Nope.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.523
Nope.

08:43.898 --> 08:46.776
911, she moved...

08:47.235 --> 08:48.277
[exhales]

08:48.361 --> 08:50.238
Damn it. I got nothing.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.157
Not a single number you can recall?

08:53.449 --> 08:54.450
[exhales]

08:55.368 --> 08:56.577
Only one.

08:56.661 --> 09:00.957
God, I can't believe I betrayed
my best friend for nothing.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.333
Well, it wasn't for nothing.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.919
I asked you to do something as my wife,
and you did it,

09:05.253 --> 09:06.462
which I appreciate.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.839
-That's not the point!
-Well, it is to me.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.758
It was all because of a pissing contest.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.134
I get it. You're not happy.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.929
But you're also a businesswoman.
Deals come and go.

09:15.012 --> 09:16.681
You don't get emotionally involved.

09:16.764 --> 09:20.059
Oh, like you didn't
with that stupid basketball team?

09:20.476 --> 09:24.313
What are you getting so upset for?
This is just a crazy Frankie invention

09:24.397 --> 09:27.275
so she could reach her Fig Newtons
in the bathroom.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.611
It was for me.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.822
You wanted Fig Newtons in the bathroom?

09:32.905 --> 09:33.864
No!

09:36.325 --> 09:40.162
Frankie invented the Rise Up
because I got...

09:40.830 --> 09:42.582
stuck on our toilet.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.585
-What? When did this happen?
-When I first moved in.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.379
And I'm just hearing about this now?
Why didn't you tell me?

09:48.462 --> 09:49.797
Because it was humiliating.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.882
Oh, so what? I'm your husband.

09:51.966 --> 09:52.800
If you'd told me,

09:52.883 --> 09:55.052
-I would've gotten rid of it immediately.
-[scoffs]

09:55.136 --> 09:58.556
Like you got rid of that couch
you know I can barely get off of?

09:58.639 --> 09:59.724
[cell phone rings]

10:00.182 --> 10:01.684
Let me guess. Frankie?

10:01.767 --> 10:04.478
I wish. It's a number I don't recognize.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.856
Hello? Yeah-- Oh.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.649
Joan-Margaret. Yeah.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.068
Uh-huh.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.528
Is Frankie with you?

10:13.487 --> 10:14.697
Oh, I'll be right there.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.199
So you're just gonna go to her?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.161
In case you hadn't noticed,
we're in the middle of a conversation.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.746
I'd call it a fight.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.332
That's why I'm slamming the door.

10:25.916 --> 10:26.917
[door slams]

10:34.425 --> 10:35.384
What's this about?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.762
The board thought you deserved
to be honored...

10:37.845 --> 10:40.056
[rumbling and clattering]

10:40.723 --> 10:41.766
What the hell is that?

10:41.849 --> 10:43.601
The toilet Grace and Frankie gave us.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.728
It doesn't even rise up anymore.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.147
I had to get off the toilet all by myself.

10:48.564 --> 10:49.398
You were saying?

10:50.316 --> 10:51.275
Right.

10:51.817 --> 10:53.944
The board thought
you deserved to be honored

10:54.028 --> 10:57.365
for your incredible contribution
to the New Lear Theater. [gasps]

10:59.909 --> 11:03.412
"The Rob Hanson Concession Stand"?
Is that supposed to be me?

11:03.496 --> 11:04.872
My name is Robert.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.374
You pay by the letter, Rob.

11:07.833 --> 11:12.046
So 20 grand got me a concession stand
where we only sell coffee and water?

11:12.129 --> 11:13.839
Oh, we're not selling coffee this season.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.967
Great. I ruined my marriage,
and I can't even get three extra letters?

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
[door opens]

11:18.344 --> 11:19.970
[whispers] Get that thing
out of here, now.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.599
-What's that?
-What's what?

11:24.392 --> 11:27.937
The thing you just flipped around
when I walked in here.

11:29.855 --> 11:33.192
It's a plaque that we're putting up
at the theater to honor--

11:33.275 --> 11:34.193
Us.

11:35.486 --> 11:39.281
For giving scholarships
to theater-deprived youth. [chuckles]

11:39.782 --> 11:41.200
Oh, well...

11:42.034 --> 11:45.621
if we're being honored,
I'd like to see it then.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.124
[scoffs] Show some humility, man!

11:51.001 --> 11:53.337
Is this what we got for our money?

11:54.880 --> 11:56.006
You know what?

11:56.590 --> 11:59.051
-Ooh.
-I'm hopping on my hog,

11:59.510 --> 12:01.554
and I'm just gonna go, man.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.015
Just me, the lonely highway,

12:05.641 --> 12:07.435
and Miss Janis Ian,

12:07.518 --> 12:13.774
who I can hear
with my wildly expensive Bluetooth helmet!

12:20.197 --> 12:22.450
Good to see you boys are back to normal.

12:22.533 --> 12:25.035
-[motorcycle engine turns over]
-Give me my damn plaque.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.830
You could be a little more grateful.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.874
It could have just said "Consesh Stand."

12:30.541 --> 12:32.084
-[crash]
-[Sol cries out]

12:32.710 --> 12:33.586
Sol?

12:36.922 --> 12:38.215
Sol!

12:40.509 --> 12:41.510
Sol.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.888
She's got some giddyup.

12:51.979 --> 12:53.689
Oh, I'm not talking to you.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.233
Frankie, I'm here to pay your check
and get you out of here.

12:56.317 --> 12:57.693
I'd rather wash dishes.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.654
It turns out they don't pay
their dishwashers enough to eat here.

13:01.697 --> 13:03.365
There goes the middle class.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.993
-Can I please get a credit card?
-Absolutely.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.245
-Thank you.
-But only after she listens to me.

13:08.329 --> 13:10.664
God, have any of you
ever dined out before?

13:10.748 --> 13:12.750
It's really simple. You eat, you pay.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.960
Oh, bloody hell,
I'm not going down for this.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
You two work it out.

13:17.129 --> 13:17.963
[scoffs]

13:18.881 --> 13:21.759
I'd like a vodka martini,
very dry, extra olives.

13:21.842 --> 13:23.302
We only serve wine and beer.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.555
Then bring me a glass
and a shrimp cocktail, hold the shrimp.

13:27.264 --> 13:29.809
I will DIY a Bloody Mary.

13:31.352 --> 13:34.355
Can you just pay so I can get out of here?

13:34.897 --> 13:35.898
Frankie...

13:37.775 --> 13:41.654
I am truly sorry
for what happened on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

13:41.737 --> 13:44.740
So tell me why you couldn't be straight
with me about the Cuban thing.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.158
Have you met me?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.662
I avoid all hard conversations.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.164
It's... It's why I carry hard liquor.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.457
It's bad enough you did it,

13:53.541 --> 13:56.460
but then you made it worse
by not having the guts to tell me.

13:56.544 --> 14:00.130
Well, what do you want me to say?
[stutters] That I regret it? Because I do.

14:00.214 --> 14:02.007
That it was stupid? It was.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.928
That even when I was doing it,
it didn't feel like me? It didn't.

14:06.011 --> 14:08.013
Then why in the hell did you do it?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.890
Because it's what a good wife does!

14:11.892 --> 14:12.977
Oh, God.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.229
[exhales] What did I just say?

14:15.312 --> 14:16.689
"That's what a good wife does."

14:16.772 --> 14:21.151
Yeah, I know what I said.
I'm just horrified that I said it.

14:24.572 --> 14:28.409
I couldn't find the breakup kit,
so I brought the PMS kit instead. Okay?

14:29.618 --> 14:30.870
Yeah. [clears throat]

14:31.662 --> 14:34.623
Why doesn't Barry understand
what I gave up for him?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.126
I mean, Taneth offered me a dream job.

14:37.209 --> 14:41.380
Now I'm gonna have to report to some
stupid supervisor in San Francisco.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.009
Doesn't he understand
how I feel about supervisors?

14:45.092 --> 14:48.262
And what did he really give up
for me, anyway?

14:49.638 --> 14:51.432
Marriage and kids.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.601
-Cuddling and foreplay.
-Yeah.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.644
Right.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.898
I just thought we'd both made peace
with his compromises.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.612
What's taking so long
with that fucking Toblerone?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.452
I know this is awful. Okay?

15:11.535 --> 15:15.122
But does any part of you
think that maybe Barry is right?

15:15.205 --> 15:16.081
[Brianna exhales]

15:16.165 --> 15:19.126
I mean, you two
really do want different things.

15:19.209 --> 15:20.044
[exhales]

15:20.461 --> 15:22.588
Oh, my gosh, this is really happening.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.799
Okay. I need a Toblerone.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.969
No. You don't get PMS chocolate
for letting this happen.

15:29.845 --> 15:31.805
-Why not?
-Okay.

15:31.889 --> 15:32.932
[clears throat]

15:33.515 --> 15:36.727
I'm your real sister here, okay?
In feelings.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.897
And we don't show them to people,

15:39.980 --> 15:42.858
because then they'd know
you're really a softy.

15:43.359 --> 15:44.526
And so am I.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.696
Yeah. Being a heartless slut
is just a role I play.

15:48.197 --> 15:50.449
I have to say, you play it really well.

15:50.532 --> 15:51.492
Thank you.

15:51.575 --> 15:54.995
But the truth is I'd rather be
snuggling up with my boyfriend,

15:55.079 --> 15:57.456
watching Hallmark movies
about ladies who marry Santa.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.917
Have you ever seen <i>Loving Mrs. Kringle?</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:02.586
-Own it. With extras.
-[gasps]

16:02.670 --> 16:03.671
It has extras?

16:03.754 --> 16:06.340
Hi. How does Santa help me?

16:06.423 --> 16:10.427
Is he gonna bring me a Barry who doesn't
want to get married or a Brianna who does?

16:12.096 --> 16:13.138
[Brianna exhales]

16:13.555 --> 16:14.640
What do I do?

16:15.474 --> 16:16.642
You find a third option.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.937
[gasps]
Like Santa did in <i>Ho Ho Holy Matrimony.</i>

16:20.020 --> 16:21.021
Exactly.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.107
That reference means nothing to me.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.441
Oh.

16:24.525 --> 16:27.861
It's okay. You would need
a magical cookie oven anyway.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.948
-Yeah.
-So...

16:31.532 --> 16:35.077
When you married Nick, I knew things
were gonna change between us,

16:35.160 --> 16:37.454
but I never thought you were gonna change.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.498
Just like I did
when I was married to Robert.

16:39.581 --> 16:40.582
Hmm.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.587
I really thought
it would be different with Nick,

16:46.630 --> 16:48.424
but I lost me again.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.094
You know, the real me,
the me I am with you.

16:52.970 --> 16:55.347
-I like that you.
-Yeah, me too.

16:55.431 --> 16:56.390
[exhales]

16:57.725 --> 16:59.643
And no matter how sweet Nick is,

16:59.727 --> 17:02.688
you're always gonna be
the first person I want to call.

17:03.105 --> 17:05.024
You're my first person, too.

17:06.525 --> 17:09.987
In fact, the only number
I know by heart is yours.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.071
[exhales]

17:12.031 --> 17:12.948
What?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.118
-[Grace] Oh, God.
-What?

17:19.830 --> 17:23.000
I'm starting to wonder
if I ever should have married Nick.

17:23.917 --> 17:27.337
What kind of scam are you ladies running?
Your card was declined.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.423
What? It can't be.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.885
Well, here, try this.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.138
Thank you.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.684
I don't know what kind of scam
you're running either,

17:41.226 --> 17:44.313
but if you need it,
I've got access to a "wet floor" sign.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.065
[both laugh]

17:48.692 --> 17:51.737
So, it turns out I'm not a Son of Anarchy.

17:51.820 --> 17:55.324
[chuckles] Yes, but the good news is
someone named Rob Hanson

17:55.407 --> 17:57.785
has a concession stand named after him.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.829
I can't believe
I bought that stupid thing.

18:01.872 --> 18:06.627
I thought surviving cancer was supposed
to make you savor every moment

18:06.710 --> 18:10.172
and be less petty and wiser.

18:10.255 --> 18:15.302
[exhales] And somehow, your cancer
even managed to make me stupider.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.929
What's wrong with us, Rob?

18:17.012 --> 18:17.971
[chuckles]

18:18.764 --> 18:21.850
We forgot to savor every moment
with each other.

18:23.936 --> 18:28.732
I can't believe I blew
all of our honeymoon money.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.319
I really wanted
to go on that cruise with you.

18:32.402 --> 18:35.531
Ah, we don't need that boat.
We can still have a honeymoon.

18:35.614 --> 18:38.283
-How?
-Right here. In our beautiful home.

18:38.367 --> 18:41.453
We'll shut everything off.
We'll tell everyone we've left town.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.497
We'll order every meal in.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.416
[rumbling and clattering]

18:48.168 --> 18:49.086
Go on.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.255
[exhales] I lost it.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.258
Anyway, let's stay home.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.968
I love that idea.

18:56.051 --> 18:57.344
[Robert chuckles]

19:02.516 --> 19:03.642
Oh, shit!

19:03.725 --> 19:06.395
I knew they should have stuck
to vibrators.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.688
Oh, jeez!

19:08.939 --> 19:12.234
["You'll Lose A Good Thing"
by Barbara Lynn plays]

19:23.704 --> 19:26.290
What's going on? Adam said
you got attacked by a squirrel?

19:26.373 --> 19:29.376
Yeah, a squirrel named "I Want You Back."

19:30.210 --> 19:31.962
[exhales] Look, I really don't--

19:32.045 --> 19:34.131
Please just let me say what I need to say.

19:34.798 --> 19:38.427
I don't want to lose you,
so here's what I'm willing to do:

19:38.760 --> 19:40.512
We combine finances
like you always wanted.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.599
I give you another shelf in the closet,
and you can eat my leftovers

19:43.682 --> 19:46.351
when we order Ethiopian, ramen,
and Mexican.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.733
Look, you know
I hate thinking about the future.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.028
But the only thing I hate more is thinking
about a future without you in it.

19:58.488 --> 19:59.698
[inhales]

20:00.532 --> 20:02.242
So... [exhales]

20:04.328 --> 20:05.412
[sighs]

20:10.626 --> 20:11.668
[gasps]

20:12.169 --> 20:13.378
Oh, my God.

20:13.921 --> 20:16.965
I don't understand.
Are you-- Are you proposing to me?

20:17.299 --> 20:18.675
Yes.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.635
And no.

20:19.968 --> 20:20.844
Uh...

20:21.720 --> 20:25.974
So I'm proposing that we get engaged
and stay that way.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.185
Forever.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.232
I love you.
I know this is less than you want,

20:33.315 --> 20:37.027
but it's so much more than I thought
I could ever give anyone.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.322
[exhales]

20:41.114 --> 20:42.658
Is it enough for you?

20:53.293 --> 20:54.544
Yes.

20:54.628 --> 20:57.422
I would love to spend
the rest of my life...

20:58.340 --> 21:00.050
engaged to you.

21:05.764 --> 21:06.640
[chuckles]

21:06.723 --> 21:09.476
[soft sob]
I knew I was gonna cry today. [chuckles]

21:14.398 --> 21:16.149
What am I gonna tell Nick?

21:16.775 --> 21:18.735
You know, I don't want to lose him.

21:19.194 --> 21:22.572
I just want things to go back
to the way they were with us.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.157
I'm gonna be honest.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.119
It's going to be a very hard conversation.

21:27.202 --> 21:28.078
Yeah.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.205
So I think you should fake your own death.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.790
Oh, Frankie.

21:32.332 --> 21:34.835
You're right. Fake his death.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.378
That's never been done.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.673
Oh, there's definitely shrimp in this.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.385
I got your text
about not being able to pay.

21:43.468 --> 21:46.054
I understand the crab is market price,

21:46.138 --> 21:48.890
but you are married to a billionaire.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.143
For some reason,
none of my cards are working.

21:51.518 --> 21:52.894
Thanks for coming.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.354
No problem.

21:54.646 --> 21:57.274
It's not like anything important
was going on in my life,

21:57.357 --> 21:59.901
except I was proposing to Barry.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.778
You what?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.071
You're getting married?

22:03.155 --> 22:05.615
Even better. We're never getting married.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.368
-What?
-I know.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.786
Isn't it wonderful?

22:10.662 --> 22:13.248
We're just gonna be engaged forever.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.374
Genius.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.585
And Barry's okay with this?

22:16.668 --> 22:19.338
Please. He's already
on the phone with his mom.

22:19.755 --> 22:22.758
Oh, she must be so confused for you both.

22:22.841 --> 22:24.468
I had to come up with something.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.928
I know it's unconventional,
but it works for us.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.638
That's what you need to do.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.307
Get engaged to Barry?

22:30.390 --> 22:33.602
No, come up with something unconventional
for you and Nick.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.023
Please tell me you've either
come to pay the check or kill me.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.191
I don't care anymore.

22:39.274 --> 22:42.194
-So I just got engaged today.
-Okay.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.279
Thank you.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.408
Um, so I don't know if that entitles me
to a special discount or anything.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.827
I know some places do stuff like that.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.496
It's classy.

22:52.579 --> 22:56.124
Yeah, because that's what we're
known for here at The Crab Barrel.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.047
Yeah, I understand.

23:02.422 --> 23:03.507
Oh, she's home.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.467
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:05.550 --> 23:06.676
Thank God you're back.

23:07.094 --> 23:08.804
Yeah, I'm sorry I left like that.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.472
I was being stupid.

23:10.972 --> 23:15.102
I'm sorry I keep making Frankie an issue.
I... I know you love me.

23:15.477 --> 23:18.021
And I have absolutely no reason
to be insecure.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.147
Oh, boy.

23:19.523 --> 23:20.649
Um...

23:20.732 --> 23:22.651
Nick, it's-it's not all on you.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.404
I should have told you
about that day in the bathroom.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.322
Look, I get it.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.324
The longer you don't
tell someone something,

23:29.408 --> 23:31.368
the harder it is to ever say.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.120
And then when you tell them,

23:33.203 --> 23:35.664
it may not be exactly
what they want to hear.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.166
But if-if they can deal with it,

23:38.250 --> 23:43.922
then the relationship can maybe turn
into a different kind of relationship.

23:44.005 --> 23:47.008
-Right. You can't fear change.
-Yeah.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.637
The important thing is,
no matter how crazy things get,

23:51.138 --> 23:53.598
-you get through them together.
-[knocking on door]

23:53.682 --> 23:56.017
-Who's that?
-It's change.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.525
-Oh, my God!
-Mrs. Skolka,

24:03.608 --> 24:06.194
-I'm Agent Fenmore with the FBI.
-What the hell?

24:06.820 --> 24:08.905
Nick Skolka, you're under arrest.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.031
Hi, Karin.

24:10.574 --> 24:12.701
What...? What's happening?

24:12.784 --> 24:14.494
Remember how we were just talking about

24:14.578 --> 24:16.830
the longer you don't
say something to someone,

24:16.913 --> 24:18.540
the harder it is to say?

24:18.623 --> 24:19.875
[whispers] Say what?

24:19.958 --> 24:22.377
Things like securities fraud
and tax evasion.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.505
Allegedly. Really, Karin? Handcuffs?

24:26.006 --> 24:28.800
-Nick?
-Call Miriam. She knows what to do.

24:29.759 --> 24:31.970
Could I have a second
with my wife, please?

24:34.723 --> 24:36.391
I'm really sorry about this.

24:37.767 --> 24:40.729
I swear, it's all a misunderstanding,
and it's all gonna work out.

24:40.812 --> 24:41.980
Is it?

24:42.731 --> 24:43.565
Let's go.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.360
And Grace...

24:48.278 --> 24:50.113
sit on that couch you hate,

24:50.197 --> 24:52.782
and you might just figure out
how to rise up.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.202
Well, what does that mean?

24:55.744 --> 24:57.078
Don't give up on me.

24:58.371 --> 24:59.456
I love you.

25:11.426 --> 25:14.429
[Grace] I can't believe
I didn't see this coming.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.056
The trip to the Caymans,

25:16.348 --> 25:19.559
selling off his art,
the credit cards being declined.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.562
And he did brag a lot about evading taxes.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.272
-Yeah, he really did, didn't he?
-Hmm.

25:26.107 --> 25:27.776
What am I gonna do now, Frankie?

25:27.859 --> 25:29.986
Oh, that's the easy part.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.488
-I'm taking you home.
-Oh.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.406
[scoffs]

25:33.490 --> 25:35.951
[grunts] What is it with this couch?

25:36.451 --> 25:39.579
Nick said something really weird
before they took him away.

25:39.663 --> 25:42.874
Yeah. Was it, "You'll never take me alive,
you dirty copper"?

25:43.291 --> 25:45.126
No, because he isn't Jimmy Cagney.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.296
He said, if I sat
on this stupid couch long enough,

25:48.380 --> 25:51.633
I'd figure out how to solve
our... our Rise Up problem.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.427
Wait a minute.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.888
He said this couch?

25:57.430 --> 25:59.224
Well, it's the only one here.

25:59.599 --> 26:05.021
This very couch that you've hated
since the day you moved in?

26:05.105 --> 26:07.566
Well, actually, I hated it
before I moved in.

26:07.941 --> 26:12.028
The couch he mysteriously
never got rid of?

26:12.404 --> 26:14.698
I find that interesting, Grace.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.783
Very interesting.

26:17.284 --> 26:22.789
Is it possible this couch is uncomfortable
for a reason?

26:22.872 --> 26:25.125
Yeah. Poor Italian design.

26:26.042 --> 26:27.085
Step aside.

26:27.168 --> 26:29.379
[scoffs] I can't even get off it.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.089
-[Frankie chuckles]
-[Grace stammers]

26:31.172 --> 26:33.091
Oh, yeah. I can step aside.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.595
God, Frankie.
Why do you have a box cutter?

26:36.886 --> 26:39.973
I grabbed it this morning.
I thought it was a pack of gum.

26:40.724 --> 26:41.891
No, no, Frankie, don't!

26:41.975 --> 26:43.268
What? Stop!

26:43.351 --> 26:46.771
Frankie, what are you doing?
Frankie, no! Stop it.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.857
I sure hope I'm right.

26:48.940 --> 26:49.941
[Grace] God.

26:52.360 --> 26:53.737
[gasps] Oh!

26:54.154 --> 26:55.947
-My God!
-[laughs]

26:56.948 --> 27:00.285
I used to be excited
when I found nickels in the couch.

27:00.368 --> 27:01.620
[whispers] Frankie!

27:01.703 --> 27:03.413
[Frankie laughs]

27:03.496 --> 27:07.417
Oh, my God. I think we've got
our funding for the Rise Up!

27:08.710 --> 27:09.961
Thank you, Nick!

27:10.045 --> 27:11.880
I'm gonna go see what's in the mattress.

27:11.963 --> 27:14.132
Yeah, no, Frankie! Stop.

27:16.885 --> 27:17.969
[exhales]

27:18.720 --> 27:21.681
Well, we're definitely registering
for a shit-ton of gifts.

27:21.765 --> 27:23.808
Can we do that if we know we're
never gonna get married?

27:23.892 --> 27:26.311
Well, we can if you want
that nine-and-a-half quart

27:26.394 --> 27:28.563
Le Creuset Dutch oven in matte navy.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.482
That'll complete my set. [chuckles]

27:30.565 --> 27:32.025
Come here. Mmm.

27:34.402 --> 27:36.738
Well, look at you two canoodling
on the couch.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.074
We're engaged and registering, bitch!

27:41.743 --> 27:44.454
I can't believe I said that.
Uh, forgive me?

27:44.788 --> 27:48.792
Hmm. Well, seeing you guys so happy
is a beautiful thing.

27:50.085 --> 27:51.044
Especially you.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.420
Thank you.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.508
Crazy thing. I got a call from Taneth.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.218
She called you?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.513
Yeah. We've actually talked a few times.

28:01.596 --> 28:03.973
Of course, she's so upset
you didn't take the job.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.601
Oh, man. Is she sulking?

28:07.018 --> 28:08.436
Yeah.

28:09.229 --> 28:11.898
But I've been getting her
to focus on other stuff.

28:11.981 --> 28:15.735
And she really appreciated it and, um...

28:16.861 --> 28:17.862
offered me a job.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.531
That's incredible!

28:19.614 --> 28:21.825
The one she offered you
in San Francisco, and I'm taking it.

28:21.908 --> 28:24.703
-Incredibly bad for everyone in this room.
-Wait.

28:28.832 --> 28:30.083
You took my job?

28:31.835 --> 28:34.796
And so now you're my boss?

28:34.879 --> 28:35.964
No.

28:36.047 --> 28:37.757
No, no, no, no, no, not boss.

28:38.341 --> 28:40.218
-Not boss at all.
-Okay.

28:41.177 --> 28:42.303
Supervisor.

28:50.562 --> 28:51.813
[Grace] I feel so guilty.

28:51.896 --> 28:56.609
Why? Because you wanted to be back
at the beach house with me so bad,

28:56.693 --> 28:59.195
you manifested your husband's arrest?

28:59.279 --> 29:00.447
[slight chuckle] No.

29:01.364 --> 29:05.493
Because this is what I wanted. I...
I just didn't want it this way.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.621
Oh, Grace, Nick is white-collar.

29:09.205 --> 29:11.875
In three years,
he'll probably be president.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.293
[both laugh]

29:13.376 --> 29:15.920
In the meantime, let's enjoy what we have.

29:16.713 --> 29:19.632
-It is good to be back.
-Oh.

29:19.716 --> 29:20.967
[both chuckle]

29:23.803 --> 29:25.096
Ah, hey, look.

29:26.222 --> 29:28.975
What are you two jabronis doing here?

29:30.185 --> 29:31.394
Funny story.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.189
Our entire house flooded.

29:34.564 --> 29:37.317
-Oh, not funny "ha-ha."
-What happened?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.111
What happened was your Rise Up exploded.

29:40.195 --> 29:41.446
Oh, God.

29:41.529 --> 29:45.700
But the best part is,
our insurance says they won't cover it.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.828
But they did recommend
going after the people who gave it to us.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.456
-Oh, God.
-And since I now own

29:51.539 --> 29:55.752
the most expensive concession stand
in America, and he's a hog man,

29:56.628 --> 29:59.088
we can't even afford to stay in a hotel.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.424
We've got 50 grand in the freezer.

30:01.508 --> 30:04.928
Peel off a hundy,
get yourself a motel for the night.

30:05.011 --> 30:08.890
Oh, our house is going to be
a construction site for months.

30:10.225 --> 30:11.309
Roomies.

30:12.602 --> 30:13.686
Oh, God.
