WEBVTT

00:49.383 --> 00:50.509
Hey.

00:50.592 --> 00:51.593
Hey, man.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.720
-Good to see you.
-Yeah.

00:53.804 --> 00:55.681
All good. Put them there. Right there.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.432
Yeah.
Prince said he called for reinforcements.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.395
-Yeah, just here to help out.
-Welcome to hell, brother.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.067
How's our boy?

01:07.776 --> 01:09.903
Yeah. I think he wants to stay with us.

01:30.924 --> 01:31.925
Fuck.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.303
-You want some?
-Yeah.

01:37.806 --> 01:38.932
All right.

01:39.016 --> 01:42.936
Your brother seems to want you back.
Can we trust him?

01:43.645 --> 01:44.730
All I know is…

01:45.564 --> 01:48.483
Tariq is not gonna lift a finger
to save me. Okay?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.320
This will be another way
that I have embarrassed him,

01:51.403 --> 01:53.447
and you don't know him, you know?
You don't know him.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.283
He's not a good person.
He's a piece of shit.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.577
So, you have to take me back, okay?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.955
Just-- I swear.
Just take me back and I forget you.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.499
I ever-- I have money.
I have a lot of money.

02:04.583 --> 02:07.002
If you want money, I have a lot of money,
bro. Please, no, don't!

02:07.085 --> 02:10.881
No!

02:11.715 --> 02:15.469
No!

02:19.681 --> 02:20.682
Fuck!

02:25.395 --> 02:26.480
How long we gonna wait

02:26.563 --> 02:28.440
-for this fucking call?
-They'll call.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.444
We've been here all day, Eric.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.656
And what he told me, I…

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
Tariq will call.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.954
All right.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.316
Hey, Roy. Morning. Wakey-wakey.

03:59.698 --> 04:03.076
Hey, man. Come on. Just get up.

04:06.413 --> 04:07.539
Oh, God.

04:22.721 --> 04:26.350
It's taking too long, man.
Something's wrong.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.687
Just saying,
Tariq would have called by now.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.190
He knows we have his brother.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.153
I'd say this plan is clearly not working.

04:38.237 --> 04:39.571
He ain't playing, man.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.491
Just because it's taking longer
doesn't mean it's not working.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.786
He wants his brother back, trust me.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.206
You guys are all over Twitter.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.170
Shit.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.891
Hi.

06:31.517 --> 06:32.726
Hi.

06:32.809 --> 06:33.685
How are you?

06:36.146 --> 06:37.147
Fine.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.319
Can we please talk?

06:59.294 --> 07:00.838
Why are you here?

07:02.005 --> 07:02.881
Sorry?

07:04.174 --> 07:05.843
Why aren't you at work?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.722
Is Gloria okay?

07:11.682 --> 07:12.641
Yes.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.019
I just dropped her off at school.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.272
I came back to get some documents.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.315
Okay.

07:21.441 --> 07:24.236
She's also worried about you, you know.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.075
I am not going to pretend

07:31.952 --> 07:34.121
-that I understand what you went through.
-No.

07:34.830 --> 07:36.248
I appreciate that.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.250
But…

07:40.335 --> 07:42.296
can you help me understand?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.840
I'm not a psychiatrist.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.551
But I am your husband and I love you.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.730
-Violeta.
-What?

08:03.358 --> 08:06.653
Look, I'm glad we're finally
talking about this.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.532
I spoke to the General.
He explained everything to me.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.416
What is that?

08:21.877 --> 08:23.253
Where are you going?

08:24.129 --> 08:25.547
To work.

08:25.631 --> 08:26.757
To work?

08:29.676 --> 08:33.013
You've barely said 10 words to me
or your daughter since you got back.

08:33.764 --> 08:36.265
You were in a firefight
and almost got killed.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.518
But you don't want my help,

08:37.601 --> 08:39.394
you won't talk to anyone,
you won't see a therapist.

08:39.477 --> 08:40.645
Look, your American friends.

09:34.366 --> 09:38.745
Ms. Matíz, I have read
your articles with great interest.

09:39.538 --> 09:42.749
It was very brave of you
to help that American woman.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.546
I don't know
that I could have done the same.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.425
We had hoped for
a different outcome. I'm not that brave.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.054
In this office
we all think you were very brave.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.432
Ms. Matíz, it's an honor, truly.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.934
The President is waiting for you inside.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.357
Violeta Matíz.

10:07.858 --> 10:08.817
Nice to see you again.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.445
Mr. President, thank you for having me
on such short notice.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.988
I have been looking forward to seeing you.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.448
This way, please.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.326
Now, let me say, first

10:17.409 --> 10:19.536
that despite our best efforts,
there are still those

10:19.620 --> 10:22.080
in our country who would perpetuate
this kind of violence.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.376
I will be the first to admit,
if something had happened to you

10:26.460 --> 10:27.544
it would have been a tragedy.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.630
You are the most important journalist
in the country.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.632
Thank you very much, sir.

10:31.715 --> 10:35.052
A lot of young Colombian women admire
and look up to you.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.680
Too bad our political views
are not completely in sync.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.934
You're not exactly a supporter
of my party.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.436
My personal political beliefs
are irrelevant, sir.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.563
Yes, of course, you're objective.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.107
In fact, that's what I'm counting on,
an objective observation.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.317
That is the job.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.362
So, what can I help you with?

10:54.196 --> 10:56.907
There's a story I have been working on
for The Times

10:56.990 --> 10:58.825
and I would like your opinion about it.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.453
It's about the kidnapping in Medellín.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.248
It's likely that Americans were behind it.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.167
Here are some images

11:07.251 --> 11:09.419
from the surveillance cameras
at the stadium.

11:10.796 --> 11:11.797
I know who they are.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.298
I had one of them on my show.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.677
They're U.S. Special Forces.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.347
Yes, this is being investigated.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.643
My guess is that if I have access
to these images

11:24.726 --> 11:27.479
the intelligence services
must have briefed you.

11:28.272 --> 11:31.525
Did you give the DNI any special
instructions on how to handle them?

11:31.608 --> 11:33.318
Sir, why weren't they arrested?

11:33.402 --> 11:35.279
Why haven't they been questioned at least?

11:35.362 --> 11:38.115
You know I can't speak about an
ongoing investigation.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.200
If you'll excuse me.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.578
My aide will put you in touch with
somebody from the military

11:42.661 --> 11:44.872
who can answer any further questions
or concerns.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.331
Yes, of course.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.917
Now, there's a small matter
that needs my attention.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.544
Thank you very much for your time.

11:50.627 --> 11:52.087
-Nice to see you.
-Excuse me.

11:57.801 --> 12:00.262
-Times. Lindgren.
-Hey. It's Violeta.

12:01.513 --> 12:02.931
Hey, V. What's up?

12:03.015 --> 12:05.767
The president was evasive.
That's to be expected.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.394
Well, yes, I suppose.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.271
At this point, I am almost certain

12:09.354 --> 12:11.565
the CIA is involved with these guys.

12:13.817 --> 12:17.654
I mean, how else will you explain
why they are not being arrested?

12:19.698 --> 12:22.826
What I still don't know
is where my country pans out in this.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.620
Are they helping or not?

12:26.121 --> 12:27.706
I have to admit…

12:28.290 --> 12:30.751
I'm afraid we're slipping back in time

12:30.834 --> 12:33.754
to when the US
did whatever they wanted to in Colombia.

12:35.047 --> 12:37.090
Yeah, well, you may be on to something.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.261
There may be dangerous times ahead,
but you just keep digging, okay?

12:42.179 --> 12:43.305
Hang in there, champ.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.422
The famous Violeta Matíz.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.175
You've been busy lately.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.594
Are you tracking me?

13:24.680 --> 13:25.722
I don't track you.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.603
We get reports from the Colombian side.
They track the shit out of you.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.650
I'm writing about the American SF guys.

13:37.442 --> 13:41.572
I know them,
and I know what they're doing.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.033
That sounds like an interesting story.

13:45.617 --> 13:47.619
Yeah. It is.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.792
They have help.

13:57.796 --> 13:58.881
It's you, right?

14:04.303 --> 14:07.389
Yeah. It's you.

14:08.974 --> 14:10.851
Hey. So where we at?

14:10.934 --> 14:12.102
Still waiting.

14:13.395 --> 14:14.563
You decided what you wanna do?

14:14.646 --> 14:17.107
We can't do that here.
We need to be more remote.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.233
I'll make it happen.

14:18.734 --> 14:19.735
Copy that.

14:22.237 --> 14:28.577
Listen, slight complication.
Your mother-in-law's here.

14:28.660 --> 14:29.745
What?

14:32.956 --> 14:35.083
Give your mama some sugar.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.255
Why are you here?

14:41.423 --> 14:44.468
Well, you know, that's just what I said
to you when you were born.

14:45.052 --> 14:46.512
But you turned out all right.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.682
I'm sorry, Mom, but--
Listen, I don't understand.

14:51.225 --> 14:56.188
What's to understand, son? You're here,
Amber's here, my son-in-law is here.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.399
When y'all left we were family.
That hasn't changed, right?

15:00.192 --> 15:01.068
Right.

15:01.151 --> 15:04.404
Hey, don't worry about me, son,
I can be useful.

15:05.614 --> 15:06.615
I know, Mom.

15:07.241 --> 15:10.661
I'm just saying, it'd be nice if
you gave me a little heads-up, that's all.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.704
I texted you, didn't I?

15:13.455 --> 15:16.750
Jesus, everybody but me
needs to be coddled all the time.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.169
Thank you.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.100
Okay.

15:33.642 --> 15:35.269
-This is home.
-Okay.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.860
-Hi, Maggie.
-Hi.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.324
Come here.

15:58.542 --> 15:59.418
Hi.

15:59.501 --> 16:01.295
Roy, this is my mother-in-law,

16:01.378 --> 16:02.838
Margaret Chesborough. Mom, Roy.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.174
-Hi.
-Extremely charmed to meet you, ma'am.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.425
Roy works with Eric.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.761
You must be thirsty.
Can I get you a drink?

16:10.345 --> 16:13.765
I suppose I would take a beer.
If it's not too much trouble.

16:13.849 --> 16:17.394
-And one for my son too.
-No, thank you. I'm on the wagon.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.106
Good for you, buster.

16:22.691 --> 16:23.734
It won't last.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.867
-Would you like a glass?
-Thank you. No, this is great.

16:33.577 --> 16:34.745
Right. Perfect.

16:40.209 --> 16:43.170
Well, cheers, boys.

16:43.754 --> 16:44.796
Cheers.

16:48.008 --> 16:49.051
Oh, man.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.222
All right. Bathroom's on the left.

16:53.722 --> 16:56.058
There's a bad guy
tied up in the bedroom on the right.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.269
This is our bedroom.
This is where we're gonna sleep.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.358
What's all this?

17:06.527 --> 17:07.903
It's a small arsenal.

17:08.612 --> 17:10.364
What are you planning, son?

17:15.702 --> 17:19.705
Amber was taken to a black site
facility near the border of Venezuela.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.417
I tracked her there but

17:24.586 --> 17:28.339
it was very heavily guarded,
and a straight-up extraction is tricky.

17:29.424 --> 17:30.801
And the CIA isn't gonna help.

17:31.426 --> 17:33.262
Well, there's a fucking surprise.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.098
But Prince did find out

17:36.181 --> 17:39.852
that the guy that runs the prison system
in Venezuela has a younger brother.

17:40.978 --> 17:43.605
So, we grabbed him and brought him here.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.483
Straight-up hostage swap, then?

17:48.193 --> 17:49.194
Yeah.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.657
Then why all the hardware?
That your plan B?

17:54.366 --> 17:56.410
No, plan B is something else.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.999
Look, Mom, I--

18:02.082 --> 18:03.584
I gotta go run a little errand.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.626
You gonna be okay?

18:04.710 --> 18:06.920
Yeah. I need a little rest anyway.

18:07.504 --> 18:11.884
Yeah, course. It's a long trip.
You must be tired. All right.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.093
Thank you.

18:15.554 --> 18:16.555
Prince?

18:18.849 --> 18:20.225
Hey, Roy. You seen Prince?

18:20.309 --> 18:21.518
Yeah, he left already.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.020
All right.

18:25.022 --> 18:26.190
I'll see you later.

18:26.273 --> 18:27.274
Okay.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.489
You fancy watching some rugby?

18:44.625 --> 18:47.085
Go, go, go! There we go.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.712
There you go. Yes!

18:49.213 --> 18:51.798
That's a try. Like a touchdown.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.428
My team's playing after this game.
The All Blacks.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.263
They're all Black?

18:58.347 --> 18:59.932
No, we wear the black jerseys.

19:00.015 --> 19:01.642
-From New Zealand.
-Okay.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.435
But these guys are tough.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.147
Very good.

19:07.231 --> 19:09.399
…Argentinean defense. Here they go again.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.235
Goes short to Samu that time, Beale.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.279
On they come, Argentina.
There's Tupou making another tackle.

19:14.363 --> 19:15.197
Cleaned up by…

19:15.280 --> 19:19.910
You know, I think I'm gonna go freshen up.

19:19.993 --> 19:22.162
-Yeah. You go. I'll be here.
-All right.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.414
…having a chat with Jaco Peyper is all.

19:24.498 --> 19:27.501
That's going on. Boffelli says,
"Look, skit, I'll whip through the three."

19:27.584 --> 19:29.545
We're off to the sheds.

19:30.671 --> 19:34.967
And at the break, the Wallabies
lead Argentina 15 points to 3.

19:38.512 --> 19:41.765
Slipper looking to Tupou,
then going himself.

20:02.828 --> 20:03.954
How you doing?

20:06.331 --> 20:07.332
Okey dokey.

21:09.853 --> 21:10.854
Bang.

21:25.661 --> 21:26.995
I'm gon' take a bath.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.289
Enjoy!

21:56.483 --> 22:00.112
Dragged down on the tackle of Mapimpi.
But it's there for Perenara.

22:00.904 --> 22:03.115
Change of tactics from Beauden Barrett.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.840
Take the kick, take the kick.

22:29.224 --> 22:32.436
…this match
have come from tries and conversions.

22:32.519 --> 22:36.773
The Springboks, 49% of their points
have been coming from penalty goals.

22:36.857 --> 22:38.483
So that says it all really.

22:43.322 --> 22:47.201
Just over ten minutes remaining.
And there's been a fair bit of space.

22:47.284 --> 22:48.202
I--

24:34.766 --> 24:35.767
Fuck.

25:00.792 --> 25:01.793
Hey, Mom.

25:03.045 --> 25:06.673
Goddamn great beer they have
in this country. It's just delicious.

25:07.674 --> 25:08.717
Yeah.

25:11.053 --> 25:11.970
Mom.

25:16.141 --> 25:18.185
You wanna tell me what happened here?

25:31.657 --> 25:32.658
What happened?

25:35.619 --> 25:36.787
I killed a guy.

25:40.749 --> 25:43.210
Mom. I'm sending you home.

25:47.756 --> 25:48.632
Plan B.

26:27.462 --> 26:32.801
I always wanted his nod.
You know, respect.

26:35.179 --> 26:36.555
Maybe more than my old man.

26:40.726 --> 26:42.769
He was fucking stingy with that. You know?

26:44.688 --> 26:45.731
He had family?

26:48.150 --> 26:49.610
Me and my dad were his family.

26:55.866 --> 26:59.453
He loved Amber.
He treated me differently after her.

27:01.330 --> 27:06.251
Like, kid's a man now. He finally found
a woman who will put up with him.

27:08.629 --> 27:09.713
Then he died for her.

27:26.313 --> 27:27.439
Then he died for her.

27:31.318 --> 27:32.819
Well, this isn't over, man.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.113
More people are gonna die.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.169
Hi, Hugo. What's up?

27:49.670 --> 27:51.880
Listen, V. I hate to make this call,

27:51.964 --> 27:54.466
-but we can't publish your story.
-What?

27:54.550 --> 27:56.093
You wrote an incredible piece.

27:56.176 --> 27:58.053
Obviously,
we think you're an amazing journalist.

27:58.136 --> 28:01.348
-Are you kidding me? Who killed it?
-The truth? I don't know.

28:01.431 --> 28:03.016
No, tell me. Who killed it?

28:03.100 --> 28:06.270
Publisher wouldn't tell me.
Did you poke the CIA?

28:06.353 --> 28:07.688
Fuck.

28:07.771 --> 28:10.190
I'm sorry. Good luck. Okay?

28:15.654 --> 28:16.697
Fuck.

29:25.390 --> 29:26.600
All right, buddy.

29:27.184 --> 29:28.268
Step down.

34:09.882 --> 34:10.884
Hi.

34:12.052 --> 34:13.971
-What do we have so far?
-Nothing.

34:24.106 --> 34:26.483
This ain't the Four Seasons,
I can tell you that.

34:31.196 --> 34:32.531
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

34:33.114 --> 34:36.243
You're gonna need to hear this.
Everyone is right where we want them.

34:36.994 --> 34:39.454
Tariq is on edge 'cause he knows
we're serious, and we have his brother.

34:39.538 --> 34:41.998
Now, this shouldn't take much.
Use a light touch.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.543
I ain't doing any of it. You're the pro.

34:48.380 --> 34:49.755
Don't believe everything you hear, man.

34:50.799 --> 34:52.717
Especially when it's coming from
other people at the Agency

34:52.801 --> 34:54.844
who are just trying to cover
their own asses.

34:56.722 --> 34:59.016
Right. Well, let's just get it over with,
shall we?

34:59.683 --> 35:01.435
-How's this?
-This is perfect.

35:02.436 --> 35:04.229
I'll call Tariq. You get him warmed up.

35:27.127 --> 35:29.463
-Hello.
-Listen, I got your brother nearby.

35:29.546 --> 35:31.131
He wants to talk to you.
Wanna talk to him?

35:36.637 --> 35:37.846
Here's what I'm gonna do.

35:41.141 --> 35:43.268
I'm gonna set the phone down right here.

35:43.769 --> 35:45.896
I tried to simplify this for you,
my brother.

35:45.979 --> 35:46.980
What's going on?

35:47.856 --> 35:48.857
Hello?

35:49.608 --> 35:50.859
Hello?

35:59.868 --> 36:00.869
Where the fuck's he going?

36:22.224 --> 36:23.308
All right.

36:23.809 --> 36:25.477
This is going the wrong way, Tariq.

36:26.436 --> 36:27.521
Three of your men are dead.

36:28.105 --> 36:29.773
I hope you're proud of yourself.

36:30.357 --> 36:33.527
Kidnapping a harmless puppy
like my brother and then torturing him.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.655
Is this what they teach you
in your Special Forces?

36:37.155 --> 36:38.532
What you should be concerned about

36:38.615 --> 36:40.868
is that this is only the beginning
of what they teach us.

36:41.451 --> 36:43.370
Either way, it will do you no good.

36:43.453 --> 36:46.456
As far as Amber is concerned,
my hands are tied.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.210
-The decision is over my head now.
-Bullshit.

36:50.961 --> 36:54.047
You control the prisons,
you control the facility.

36:54.631 --> 36:58.177
You're Maduro's second in command.
Everyone knows it. You can let her go.

36:58.677 --> 37:02.389
You're wrong. You're hurting
an innocent man for nothing.

37:02.973 --> 37:04.016
We're just getting started.

37:05.017 --> 37:06.602
I need you to agree

37:06.685 --> 37:08.979
to let Amber go
or this is gonna get far worse.

37:10.272 --> 37:11.773
-Momo.
-Tariq!

37:11.857 --> 37:13.775
-Brother. Please.
-Momo.

37:14.568 --> 37:15.611
This is serious, brother.

37:15.694 --> 37:16.862
They are animals.

37:16.945 --> 37:18.530
I don't think you get it.

37:18.614 --> 37:22.910
If I attach this wire, he's ruined.
You understand what that means?

37:22.993 --> 37:26.580
This is pointless. Don't you think
I would release her if I could?

37:26.663 --> 37:28.415
She means nothing to me at all.

37:28.916 --> 37:33.212
But I cannot help her
because your wife was spying for the CIA.

37:33.795 --> 37:36.423
Part of their new school
of the America's program.

37:37.007 --> 37:40.427
You can pretend all you want,
but you know this is true.

37:41.345 --> 37:44.348
My brother.
My brother is a foolish performer

37:44.431 --> 37:46.725
-whose family has disowned him.
-No, no, no.

37:47.893 --> 37:52.356
I'm not the villain in this story, Eric.
You are.

37:53.023 --> 37:55.400
You have no idea
how much of a villain I can be.

37:56.527 --> 37:58.570
Tell me you'll let her go.

37:59.321 --> 38:01.907
No, I will not let her go…

38:01.990 --> 38:03.617
-Please!
-…because I don't wish to.

38:03.700 --> 38:07.287
-Please, brother.
-Momo. Momo!

38:07.371 --> 38:09.665
This is happening
because you are a traitor.

38:09.748 --> 38:11.208
I am not a traitor.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.335
I have always been loyal to you
and to the regime.

38:13.418 --> 38:17.005
Please help me, forgive me.

38:17.089 --> 38:18.632
What the fuck do you want, huh?

38:18.715 --> 38:22.761
For the government and your brother
to save your ass?

38:22.845 --> 38:24.221
Is that what you want?

38:24.304 --> 38:25.305
Well, no.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.642
As far as I'm concerned,
they can kill you like a dog.

38:29.226 --> 38:30.936
I don't care how much you hate him.

38:31.019 --> 38:34.147
He's still your brother.
You think I don't know what that means?

38:34.231 --> 38:39.862
I think that like every spoiled American,
you think that everyone is just like you.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.448
Don't test me! That's a mistake.
I know what I am.

38:43.532 --> 38:48.412
And I know what you are too, Eric.
A rich, arrogant boy.

38:48.912 --> 38:52.499
Had you come to me with just
a small amount of humility or respect,

38:52.583 --> 38:55.586
this could be different.
But you are all the same.

38:56.170 --> 38:59.047
You think you can frighten us
into doing anything you want?

38:59.923 --> 39:05.345
But now, Amber is going to rot
in that prison

39:05.429 --> 39:07.431
for the rest of her life.

39:07.514 --> 39:11.435
And I will double, triple
my forces surrounding it.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.937
And I will let them do
whatever they wish to her,

39:14.021 --> 39:17.357
until she will be unrecognizable.

39:18.400 --> 39:23.322
I'm not testing you, Eric.
I'm beating you.

39:24.615 --> 39:27.367
I will torture him, then I will kill him.

39:27.451 --> 39:31.371
And then, then I'll come for you.

39:31.455 --> 39:38.003
Yeah, and I will leave the door open.

39:38.921 --> 39:41.924
-No, no.
-Is this what you want, you motherfucker?

39:42.007 --> 39:44.092
Please, don't.

39:45.677 --> 39:47.221
-Eric!
-What?

39:51.141 --> 39:52.184
Momo.

39:53.268 --> 39:54.269
Momo.

40:31.515 --> 40:32.724
It's all right.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.144
You're gonna be fine.

41:02.045 --> 41:04.173
-Well, that didn't work.
-Nope.

41:05.132 --> 41:07.009
Well, we got here eventually.

41:07.509 --> 41:09.178
I guess we go to war, then.

41:10.012 --> 41:11.054
Yep.

42:32.803 --> 42:34.513
I know you can do it.

42:35.264 --> 42:38.767
You can jam comms from that black site
back to the Venezuelan army.

42:39.518 --> 42:41.562
Just scramble the radio for two hours.

42:41.645 --> 42:43.605
First, I wanna talk about Medellín.

42:44.189 --> 42:46.733
Please don't tell me
that Mitch did that to help you.

42:46.817 --> 42:48.235
Why else would he do it?

42:51.071 --> 42:53.574
Do you really think
that a guy at his level,

42:54.157 --> 42:55.409
just below the seventh floor,

42:55.492 --> 42:57.452
comes down here
to help you with a kidnapping?

43:00.122 --> 43:01.540
Who did you kidnap?

43:01.623 --> 43:04.668
The brother of a minister
who runs a black site, sure,

43:04.751 --> 43:08.130
but that's not all.
What else does he control?

43:09.590 --> 43:11.842
He's got his fingers in the military,
the presidency.

43:13.677 --> 43:15.179
Think about the bigger picture.

43:19.558 --> 43:20.559
Come on, let's walk.

43:26.231 --> 43:27.900
I'm gonna hit this facility,

43:28.525 --> 43:31.862
and I need you to jam their satellites
and slow down the VZ air support.

43:32.362 --> 43:33.363
I need two hours.

43:35.115 --> 43:36.533
But what would it achieve?

43:37.659 --> 43:39.828
-I'd get her out.
-What else?

43:39.912 --> 43:41.330
What is Mitch doing here?

43:42.414 --> 43:44.917
And what will it serve
if you jack up that minister?

43:45.000 --> 43:46.418
If you do a cross-border raid?

43:47.544 --> 43:48.670
Think about the history.

43:50.297 --> 43:51.507
Go back 50 years.

43:54.426 --> 43:59.932
United States Objectives and Programs
for National Security, NSC 68.

44:00.015 --> 44:02.643
The document that President Truman signed

44:02.726 --> 44:05.896
made rolling back communism
the single highest priority.

44:08.232 --> 44:10.692
I mean,
can you imagine how fucking hard that is?

44:12.319 --> 44:15.280
Replacing left-wing leaders
with right-wingers.

44:16.156 --> 44:20.327
Military takeovers. Coups.
Protect American business interests.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.873
I mean, do you understand
how invested we are down here?

44:25.374 --> 44:26.750
It's a lifetime commitment.

44:27.793 --> 44:34.132
We're the ones who did Argentina, Bolivia,
Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Cuba,

44:34.216 --> 44:38.971
Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Nicaragua,
Paraguay, Panama and Venezuela.

44:40.389 --> 44:44.309
The CIA's number one client is the CIA.
Never forget that.

44:45.435 --> 44:48.730
Mitch wants a war. The agency needs one,

44:48.814 --> 44:50.732
-and you're gonna give it to them.
-I don't care.

44:50.816 --> 44:52.484
They don't give a shit if you live or die.

44:53.819 --> 44:55.571
We're gonna
do this cross-border operation.

44:56.405 --> 44:57.906
We're gonna hit their black site.

44:59.408 --> 45:01.702
Fuck up the cocaine, steal a prisoner.

45:02.828 --> 45:05.414
It's an instigation.
The Venezuelans will overreact.

45:06.623 --> 45:07.624
They'll hit Colombia,

45:08.834 --> 45:11.503
and it'll spiral
into a low-intensity conflict.

45:12.504 --> 45:13.672
Pretty soon, it's a war.

45:14.423 --> 45:16.884
I don't give a fuck.
I'm pretty good at war.

45:19.261 --> 45:22.973
And how many Venezuelan lives
are you willing to trade for your sister?

45:23.599 --> 45:26.185
I don't know.
How many you got? A million?

45:30.856 --> 45:32.482
-It was a shitty question.
-Yeah.

45:34.151 --> 45:35.485
I'm sorry for the lecture.

45:36.904 --> 45:39.156
I just needed to know
that you were self-aware.

45:44.369 --> 45:46.747
Listen, I'm not officially
part of Mitch's program,

45:46.830 --> 45:49.750
so I haven't been read into everything
you've been doing for him.

45:50.542 --> 45:51.543
But I have a job.

45:52.461 --> 45:57.591
My op is a hostage rescue for my wife,
and take down a black site.

45:57.674 --> 45:59.551
-It's complicated and dangerous…
-Okay.

46:00.469 --> 46:01.803
…but it pays very well.

46:02.387 --> 46:03.931
Need about 20 men total.

46:04.014 --> 46:06.016
Now, how well do you men know the border?

46:06.099 --> 46:09.144
Well enough to know
if we are doing something on their side.

46:09.228 --> 46:12.105
The Venezuelan army
will be problem if they come.

46:12.606 --> 46:14.650
Are you gonna give me the two hours?

46:14.733 --> 46:17.361
No. The best I can do is 48 minutes.

46:18.362 --> 46:19.738
Forty-eight minutes.

46:21.573 --> 46:25.410
You have 48 minutes before
Caracas receives word you're attacking.

46:26.995 --> 46:29.498
Forty-eight minutes?
That's the best you can do?

46:30.791 --> 46:31.959
You gotta give me more time.

46:32.042 --> 46:35.003
In 1970
on the way home from the moon landing,

46:35.087 --> 46:38.382
an oxygen tank blew up
on the Apollo spacecraft.

46:38.465 --> 46:42.344
The crew found themselves
60 miles off course from planet Earth.

46:42.427 --> 46:44.972
They were hurtling toward destruction.

46:45.055 --> 46:47.641
Power was out.
They had no navigation equipment.

46:48.559 --> 46:53.105
When they calculated the fuel burn
to readjust their flight path,

46:53.689 --> 46:57.734
