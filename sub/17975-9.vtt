I WANT TO HELP.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.181
I JUST...

13:27.223 --> 13:28.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE MY LIFE

13:27.223 --> 13:28.767
RIGHT NOW, YOU KNOW?

13:28.807 --> 13:30.143
I FUCKED UP SO BAD

13:28.807 --> 13:30.143
WITH LARA,

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
AND YOU GUYS ARE ALL

13:30.184 --> 13:31.686
LAUGHING AT ME.

13:31.728 --> 13:33.438
I JUST...

13:31.728 --> 13:33.438
I CAN'T HANDLE IT.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.855
OKAY.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.855
ALL RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

13:34.897 --> 13:39.277
I FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.819
I HAVE AN IDEA.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.819
READY?

13:40.861 --> 13:42.489
LISTEN TO ME.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.489
I'M GOING TO COME WITH YOU.

13:42.530 --> 13:43.698
I CAN'T DO IT.

13:43.740 --> 13:44.907
NO, I'M COMING.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.409
I'M GOING

13:44.949 --> 13:46.409
TO BE WITH YOU,

13:46.451 --> 13:47.661
AND YOU'RE GONNA

13:46.451 --> 13:47.661
TELL YOUR MOM AND DAD

13:47.702 --> 13:49.788
BEFORE YOUR MOTHER

13:47.702 --> 13:49.788
GETS THE AWARD, OKAY?

13:49.828 --> 13:52.081
JUST BLAM, "MOM, DAD,

13:49.828 --> 13:52.081
I'M A LESBIAN."

13:52.123 --> 13:54.751
NO BIG DEAL, JUST LIKE THAT,

13:52.123 --> 13:54.751
BECAUSE THERE'S NO WAY

13:54.793 --> 13:56.002
YOUR PARENTS ARE GOING

13:54.793 --> 13:56.002
TO MAKE A SCENE

13:56.043 --> 13:58.797
IN FRONT OF

13:56.043 --> 13:58.797
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

13:58.837 --> 14:00.965
I CAN LOOK REPUBLICAN.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.925
WHO THE HELL DOES SHE

14:01.007 --> 14:02.925
THINK SHE IS?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.843
I MEAN, I'M A TOTAL

14:02.967 --> 14:04.843
STRANGER TO HER.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.805
SHE KNOWS NOTHING

14:04.885 --> 14:06.805
ABOUT MY RACE POLITICS,

14:06.845 --> 14:08.682
NOTHING ABOUT

14:06.845 --> 14:08.682
MY SELF-IDENTIFICATION,

14:08.723 --> 14:09.848
NOTHING.

14:09.890 --> 14:14.395
SHE'S A WRITER.

14:09.890 --> 14:14.395
YOLANDA WATKINS.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.939
I GOOGLED HER.

14:14.437 --> 14:16.939
TEACHES AT UCLA.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.192
SHE'S PUBLISHED

14:16.981 --> 14:19.192
THREE VOLUMES OF POETRY

14:19.233 --> 14:21.319
AND TWO BOOKS

14:19.233 --> 14:21.319
OF NON-FICTION,

14:21.361 --> 14:22.945
INCLUDING, UH,

14:22.987 --> 14:25.323
SISTAH, STAND UP.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.950
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

14:25.365 --> 14:27.950
SOME FUN WITH HER.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.410
WE?

14:29.452 --> 14:32.539
YOU'RE NOT THE ONE

14:29.452 --> 14:32.539
SHE JUMPED ALL OVER.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.833
I WAS JUST AS UPSET ABOUT IT

14:32.580 --> 14:34.833
AS YOU WERE, BABY.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.209
I DON'T THINK SO, TINA.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.878
IT WAS MY WHOLE LIFE

14:36.250 --> 14:38.878
SHE WAS ATTACKING.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.839
MY LIFE.

14:44.175 --> 14:45.926
SO, JEN,

14:45.968 --> 14:47.970
WERE YOU ALWAYS A LESBIAN?

14:48.012 --> 14:50.849
I NEVER SAID

14:48.012 --> 14:50.849
I WAS A LESBIAN.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.434
SO IT JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE

14:50.890 --> 14:53.434
AND BIT YOU ON THE ASS?

14:53.476 --> 14:55.895
JUST LIKE THAT?

14:55.936 --> 14:59.315
BECAUSE ME, YOU KNOW,

14:55.936 --> 14:59.315
I LOVE WOMEN.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.401
YEAH, FOR COMPANIONSHIP,

15:01.442 --> 15:05.071
I FIGURE I COULD DO WITHOUT

15:01.442 --> 15:05.071
THE COMPANY OF MEN ENTIRELY,

15:05.112 --> 15:07.824
EXCEPT, DUDE,

15:07.866 --> 15:09.116
I CAN'T GET DOWN

15:07.866 --> 15:09.116
WITH THE PUSS.

15:09.158 --> 15:10.410
I LOVE A DICK.

15:10.451 --> 15:12.203
I THINK I'M BISEXUAL.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.371
OH, BROTHER.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.748
I DO.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.748
I REALLY DO.

15:14.789 --> 15:17.083
JENNY, IS THIS JUST YOUR WAY

15:14.789 --> 15:17.083
OF TELLING ME

15:17.124 --> 15:18.668
THAT YOU HAD

15:18.710 --> 15:20.920
A HUGE CRUSH ON ME

15:18.710 --> 15:20.920
IN COLLEGE?

15:20.961 --> 15:22.881
ANNETTE...

15:25.091 --> 15:26.509
NO.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.635
YOU'RE LYING.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.136
YOU'RE MADLY IN LOVE WITH ME.

15:29.178 --> 15:30.597
WELL,

15:30.638 --> 15:32.891
I'VE GOT TO GET A LOOK

15:30.638 --> 15:32.891
AT THIS MARINA,

15:32.932 --> 15:33.892
SEE IF SHE'S WORTH IT.

15:33.933 --> 15:34.934
NO.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.352
YEAH.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.352
OH, NO.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.896
YEAH, NO, WE'VE GOT

15:36.394 --> 15:37.896
TO STALK HER.

15:37.937 --> 15:38.897
WE JUST STALK HER

15:37.937 --> 15:38.897
A LITTLE BIT,

15:38.938 --> 15:40.314
JUST SO I CAN SEE.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.524
NO, NO.

15:40.356 --> 15:41.524
NO STALKING.

15:41.566 --> 15:42.901
WHY?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.903
BECAUSE, UM,

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
HER GIRLFRIEND'S

15:44.944 --> 15:46.946
BACK IN TOWN.

15:46.987 --> 15:47.947
HER GIRLFRIEND?

15:47.988 --> 15:49.616
I KNOW.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.284
DOES THIS

15:49.657 --> 15:51.284
JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER?

15:51.325 --> 15:52.660
SHE TOLD ME

15:51.325 --> 15:52.660
THAT SHE HAD A GIRLFRIEND

15:52.702 --> 15:54.746
AFTER TIM LEFT ME,

15:54.788 --> 15:56.414
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.665
I WOULD HAVE

15:56.456 --> 15:57.665
DONE EVERYTHING

15:57.707 --> 15:59.876
IN THE EXACT SAME WAY

15:57.707 --> 15:59.876
I DID IT NOW.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.878
I WOULD HAVE.

16:01.920 --> 16:04.213
OKAY, IS THERE

16:01.920 --> 16:04.213

16:04.255 --> 16:05.381
NO.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.549
FINE.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.593
THIS IS WHAT I THINK.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.177
I'VE GOT TO SEE THIS WOMAN,

16:10.219 --> 16:11.429
AND YOU'VE GOT

16:10.219 --> 16:11.429

YOU DON'T ALWAYS MAKE

17:58.160 --> 17:59.412
THE BEST DECISIONS.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.999
WELL, IN THIS CASE,

18:13.885 --> 18:14.886
SAW YOU SITTING

18:13.885 --> 18:14.886
AT THE BAR,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.888
HAVING A DRINK,

18:14.928 --> 18:16.888
AND HE LEFT.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.472

18:18.514 --> 18:20.433
YOU WERE THERE.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.433
YOU KNOW I WASN'T DRINKING.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.477
I MUST HAVE BEEN IN THE BATHROOM

18:20.474 --> 18:23.477
WHEN HE CAME.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.230
YOU KNOW I WASN'T DRINKING.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.648
OH, NICE.

18:27.690 --> 18:28.816
YOU'VE ALWAYS

18:28.858 --> 18:30.192
GOT TO TAKE ME

18:28.858 --> 18:30.192
DOWN A NOTCH,

18:30.234 --> 18:31.193
YOU KNOW, WHY CAN'T

18:31.235 --> 18:32.403
"WELL DONE, KIT.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.654
"SLIM DADDY

18:32.445 --> 18:33.654
WANTS TO SAMPLE

18:33.696 --> 18:34.906
"ONE OF YOUR SONGS

18:34.948 --> 18:36.950
"AND YOU GOT THROUGH

18:34.948 --> 18:36.950
A TERRIBLE SITUATION

18:36.991 --> 18:38.034
"THE OTHER NIGHT

18:38.076 --> 18:39.410
WITHOUT A DRINK."

18:39.452 --> 18:40.912
YOU CAN'T EVEN

18:39.452 --> 18:40.912
GIVE ME THAT,

18:40.954 --> 18:42.872
CAN YOU?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.892
OH, HELLO.

I WAS JUST LOOKING

19:05.853 --> 19:10.108
FOR A CIGARETTE.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.943
GUESS I SHOULD

19:10.149 --> 19:11.943
HAVE ASKED, HUH?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.611
YEAH.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.279
HEY, CLIVE,

19:13.653 --> 19:15.279

19:15.321 --> 19:17.364
ALL THOSE BANNERS THAT

19:15.321 --> 19:17.364
ARE AROUND THE HOUSE

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
THAT SAY

19:17.406 --> 19:19.199
"SMOKING KILLS WOMEN"?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.410
IF I'M RIGHT, I THINK

19:19.241 --> 19:21.410
THERE'S ONE OVER THE TOILET, NO?

19:21.452 --> 19:23.412
