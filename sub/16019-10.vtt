WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:04.087
OKAY, SO CARDS ON THE TABLE--

00:01.710 --> 00:04.087
I'M NOT THAT GREAT AT DATING.

00:04.129 --> 00:06.924
MY EX-FIANCE AND I WERE TOGETHER

00:04.129 --> 00:06.924
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,

00:06.966 --> 00:09.217
SO I JUST HAVEN'T HAD

00:06.966 --> 00:09.217
A TON OF EXPERIENCE AT IT.

00:09.259 --> 00:12.304
MY ROOMMATE SAYS YOU SHOULD

00:09.259 --> 00:12.304
TREAT DATING AS A GAME.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.097
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:12.346 --> 00:14.097
I'M TALKING TO THIS GUY.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.767
NO, WHY ARE YOU SAYING

00:14.139 --> 00:16.767
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING? IT'S BORING.

00:16.809 --> 00:18.101
WHAT? IT'S NOT BORING.

00:18.143 --> 00:21.104
I'M SORRY. MY FRIEND WANTS

00:18.143 --> 00:21.104
TO APOLOGIZE FOR HER BORINGNESS.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.982
I DO NOT WANT TO APOLOGIZE

00:21.146 --> 00:22.982
FOR MY BORINGNESS.

00:23.022 --> 00:24.859
TO MAKE UP FOR IT,

00:23.022 --> 00:24.859
SHE'LL SHOW YOU HER TATERS.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.067
MY WHAT?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.067
YOU KNOW, YOUR RACK.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.237
YOUR GUNS. YOUR GEEGAWS.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.237
YOUR JILK MUGS.

00:29.279 --> 00:32.950
SEE?  SO  BORING.

01:05.649 --> 01:07.735
THAT SHE DIDN'T PICK SEAN.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.111
OH, ME, TOO.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.111
HE'S  SUCH  A KISS-ASS.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.906
"YOU'RE SO STRONG, MAY!"

01:17.411 --> 01:18.913
THAT SHOW SUCKS.

01:18.954 --> 01:20.205
JAMES IS SUPER JUDGY

01:18.954 --> 01:20.205
ABOUT TV HOSTS.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.499
(exhales) LOOK AT THAT CLOWN.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.125
I'M A WAY BETTER HOST

01:22.541 --> 01:24.125
THAN HE IS.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.127

THE DATING SHOW

01:27.337 --> 01:28.547
I JUST HOSTED IN BELGIUM.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.924
AND THE LOVERS ARE SPINNING.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.800
DIEDRICK, ARE YOU READY

01:29.965 --> 01:31.800
FOR YOUR CHANCE

01:31.842 --> 01:33.134
AT UNIMAGINABLE LUST?

01:33.176 --> 01:34.177
JA!  (laughs)

01:34.219 --> 01:35.387
WONDERBAAR!

01:37.973 --> 01:41.309
AHH. GREAT TASTE.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.309
ALWAYS ONE-OF-A-KIND.

01:41.351 --> 01:42.310
IT WAS A LITTLE

01:41.351 --> 01:42.310
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.812
I MEAN, THE--THE WHEELS

01:42.352 --> 01:43.812
WERE DANGEROUS.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.147
BUT I HAD SOME

01:43.854 --> 01:46.147
REALLY GOOD IDEAS.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.858
IF THE PRODUCERS

01:46.189 --> 01:47.858
HAD JUST LISTENED TO ME--

01:47.900 --> 01:49.234
QUIET!

01:47.900 --> 01:49.234

01:55.240 --> 01:57.325
CHLOE, WE'RE TRYING

01:55.240 --> 01:57.325
TO WATCH SOMETHING.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.661
AND I AM TRYING

01:57.367 --> 01:59.661
TO DO SOMEONE.

01:59.703 --> 02:02.330
NOW STOP WATCHING

01:59.703 --> 02:02.330
THESE STUPID DATING SHOWS

02:02.372 --> 02:04.666
AND GET IN THE GAME, JUNE.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.666
GO OUT AND MEET SOMEBODY.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.418
I HAVE VERY TOUGH CRITERIA.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.963
HE CAN'T BE FROM

02:06.460 --> 02:08.963
YOUR WORK OR YOUR GYM,

02:09.004 --> 02:10.171
OR LIVE IN YOUR BUILDING.

02:10.213 --> 02:12.215
(lowered voice) WE DON'T

02:10.213 --> 02:12.215
WORK TOGETHER ANYMORE.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.175
AND HE CAN'T BE SOMEONE

02:12.257 --> 02:14.175
THAT CHLOE SLEPT WITH,

02:14.217 --> 02:15.552
WHICH IS REALLY HARD TO FIND.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.471
HELLO? HOW DO

02:15.594 --> 02:17.471
YOU THINK I FEEL?

02:17.512 --> 02:20.181
I ONLY SLEEP WITH GUYS

02:17.512 --> 02:20.181
I HAVEN'T SLEPT WITH BEFORE.

02:20.223 --> 02:22.476
YOU KNOW

02:20.223 --> 02:22.476
MY SCORCHED EARTH POLICY.

02:22.517 --> 02:24.770
UM, WE'VE ACTUALLY

02:22.517 --> 02:24.770
HAD SEX BEFORE.

02:24.812 --> 02:28.065
OH. GET OUT.

02:28.107 --> 02:29.190
(man) YOU HAVE JUST ENOUGH

02:28.107 --> 02:29.190
COIL POINTS TO MAKE

02:28.107 --> 02:29.190
THAT HAPPEN...

02:29.232 --> 02:30.191
(door opens and closes)

02:30.233 --> 02:34.195
JUNE, THERE ARE TONS OF GUYS

02:30.233 --> 02:34.195
IN NEW YORK.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.364
I'M GONNA TAKE YOU OUT

02:34.237 --> 02:36.364
AND HELP YOU MEET ONE.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.491
(lowered voice)

02:36.406 --> 02:37.491
RIGHT HERE.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.200
A GOOD ONE.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.079
(mouth full) I MEAN,

02:39.242 --> 02:42.079
I WAS RIGHT THERE.

02:42.121 --> 02:43.998
WHY DOESN'T JUNE

02:42.121 --> 02:43.998
EVER CONSIDER  ME

02:44.039 --> 02:45.206
AS SOMEONE

02:44.039 --> 02:45.206
SHE MIGHT WANNA DATE?

02:45.248 --> 02:46.458
DUDE, YOU'RE IN

02:45.248 --> 02:46.458
THE FRIEND ZONE.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.085
THAT'S NOT

02:46.500 --> 02:48.085
ONE OF HER CRITERIA.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.378
THAT'S AN UNSPOKEN CRITERIA.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.380
THE FRIEND ZONE WAS ALSO

02:50.420 --> 02:52.380
ONE OF THE IDEAS I HAD

02:52.422 --> 02:54.215
TO IMPROVE THAT BELGIAN

02:52.422 --> 02:54.215
GAME SHOW THAT I HOSTED.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.843
SEE, ALL THE CONTESTANTS

02:54.257 --> 02:55.843
WOULD PUT THEIR FRIENDS

02:55.884 --> 02:58.553
IN AN AREA, OR "ZONE."

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
THAT SOUNDS...

03:00.514 --> 03:03.224
GREAT, MAN.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.309
RIGHT?

03:04.351 --> 03:05.686
(dance music playing)

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
OKAY, SO WE ARE NOT HERE

03:05.727 --> 03:07.228
TO SIT AT THE BAR

03:07.270 --> 03:08.689
AND COMPARE TAMPONS

03:07.270 --> 03:08.689
ALL NIGHT.

03:08.730 --> 03:09.690
WE ARE HERE TO TALK TO GUYS.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.692
AND STOP USING

03:09.731 --> 03:11.692
YOUR STUPID CRITERIA

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
AS AN EXCUSE

03:11.733 --> 03:13.234
TO LAY ON THE COUCH

03:13.276 --> 03:14.528
AND EAT MEXICAN SANDWICHES.

03:14.569 --> 03:16.237
(LMFAO's "Sexy and I Know It"

03:14.569 --> 03:16.237
playing)

03:16.279 --> 03:18.115
(speaking inaudibly)

03:16.279 --> 03:18.115
(whistles)

03:18.157 --> 03:19.533
(June, thinking)

03:18.157 --> 03:19.533
HIS NOSE IS WHISTLING.

03:18.157 --> 03:19.533
(whistles)

03:19.574 --> 03:21.242
HIS NOSE IS WHISTLING.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.243
(whistles)

03:22.285 --> 03:23.411
(speaking inaudibly)

03:23.453 --> 03:25.122
THIS GUY LOOKS

03:23.453 --> 03:25.122
SO ANGRY WHEN HE TALKS.

03:25.164 --> 03:28.167
HE'S NOT SAYING ANGRY WORDS,

03:25.164 --> 03:28.167
BUT HE LOOKS SO MAD.

03:28.207 --> 03:31.294
I MEAN, HE'S TALKING

03:28.207 --> 03:31.294
ABOUT RAINBOWS.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.255
(speaking inaudibly)

03:31.336 --> 03:34.255
THIS GUY HAS

03:31.336 --> 03:34.255
ORANGE MOUTH CORNERS.

03:34.297 --> 03:35.549
HE'S BEEN EATING A SLOPPY JOE,

03:35.590 --> 03:37.926
AND HE HASN'T EVEN

03:35.590 --> 03:37.926
WIPED HIS FACE.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.261
I'M JUST GONNA WIPE HIS MOUTH

03:37.968 --> 03:40.261
AND GET OUT OF HERE.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.850
HEY, YOU JUST DID

03:42.305 --> 03:44.850
A GOOD DEED THERE.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.351
OH, YOU SAW THAT?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.351
OH, YEAH.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.437
I CAN'T STAND IT WHEN PEOPLE

03:46.393 --> 03:49.437
HAVE FOOD ON THEIR FACE.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.731
IT'S SO...

03:50.772 --> 03:52.524
DISGUSTING. I KNOW!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.942
EXCEPT WHEN

03:52.566 --> 03:53.942
IT'S MY GREAT AUNT.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.653
SHE'S OLD, SO I LIKE

03:53.984 --> 03:56.653
HELPING HER WIPE HER FACE.

03:56.695 --> 03:57.863
AW, THAT'S SWEET.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.698
ANYWAY, I'M DANIEL.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.117
HI, I'M JUNE.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.535
OKAY, THIS IS GONNA

04:02.159 --> 04:03.535
SOUND WEIRD,

04:03.577 --> 04:05.079
BUT YOU JUST LIKE

04:03.577 --> 04:05.079
WHAT I IMAGINED

04:05.120 --> 04:07.288
HARRY POTTER WOULD LOOK LIKE

04:05.120 --> 04:07.288
WHEN I WAS READING THE BOOKS.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
ONLY THE--THE GROWN-UP

04:07.330 --> 04:09.666
MAN VERSION.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.918
BOTH MY PARENTS

04:09.708 --> 04:10.918
WERE ALSO KILLED,

04:10.959 --> 04:13.087
BUT NOT BY A WIZARD.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.755
I'M KIDDING.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.755
THEY'RE IN CONNECTICUT...

04:14.796 --> 04:16.548
(exhales)

04:14.796 --> 04:16.548
LEADING VERY ACTIVE LIVES.

04:16.590 --> 04:17.758
(laughs)

04:17.799 --> 04:19.342
CAN I BUY YOU A DRINK?

04:19.384 --> 04:21.261
YEAH. SURE. THANK YOU.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.100
OH, GOD, YOU'RE NEVER

04:24.431 --> 04:26.100
GONNA BELIEVE THIS.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.184
OKAY.

04:27.226 --> 04:29.310
NO, NO, I THINK

04:27.226 --> 04:29.310
I JUST MET SOMEONE.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.105
HE'S CUTE AND HE'S SINGLE,

04:31.146 --> 04:33.565
AND HE HAS A GOOD RELATIONSHIP

04:31.146 --> 04:33.565
WITH HIS GREAT AUNT.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.900
GOOD. ASK HIM OUT.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.984
REALLY? JUST LIKE THAT?

04:36.026 --> 04:36.985
OF COURSE.

04:36.026 --> 04:36.985
YOU'RE GORGEOUS.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.112
HE'LL BE

04:37.027 --> 04:38.112
THE LUCKIEST GUY HERE.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.738
JUST TOUCH UP

04:38.153 --> 04:39.738
YOUR LIP GLOSS A BIT.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.156
YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.156
I'LL DO IT.

04:41.198 --> 04:42.199
OKAY.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.208
HEY, DO YOU WANNA

04:49.831 --> 04:51.208
GO OUT SOMETIME?

04:51.250 --> 04:53.627
WOW. YOU'RE ASKING ME OUT?

04:53.668 --> 04:54.753
YEAH. IS THAT WEIRD?

04:54.795 --> 04:57.172
NO, NO. IT'S AWESOME.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.632
THE ONLY WEIRD THING

04:58.673 --> 05:00.341
IS THAT TWO DIFFERENT GIRLS

04:58.673 --> 05:00.341
JUST ASKED ME OUT

05:00.383 --> 05:02.010
IN THE SPAN OF ONE MINUTE.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.804
WHAT OTHER GIRL

05:02.052 --> 05:03.804
ASKED YOU OUT?

05:03.845 --> 05:05.889
UH, THAT GIRL

05:03.845 --> 05:05.889
RIGHT OVER THERE.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.522
(door opens)

05:14.564 --> 05:16.524
(exhales)

05:16.566 --> 05:18.652
YOU WALK FAST

05:16.566 --> 05:18.652
FOR YOUR LEG LENGTH.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.361
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

05:18.693 --> 05:20.361
HELPING ME MEET A GUY,

05:20.403 --> 05:21.863
NOT FINDING ONE

05:20.403 --> 05:21.863
FOR YOURSELF.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.406
WHEN DID YOU EVEN

05:21.905 --> 05:23.406
HAVE TIME TO ASK HIM OUT?

05:23.448 --> 05:24.783
WHEN YOU WERE

05:23.448 --> 05:24.783
PUTTING ON YOUR LIP GLOSS.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.660
THAT WAS A DIVERSION TACTIC

05:24.825 --> 05:26.660
ON MY PART.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.870
FRANKLY, YOU WERE KIND OF

05:26.701 --> 05:28.870
ALREADY WEARING TOO MUCH.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT

05:28.912 --> 05:30.371
TO ME?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED

05:30.413 --> 05:32.040
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE WANT.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.417
YOU TAKE SOMETHING THAT'S

05:32.082 --> 05:34.417
AVAILABLE--WHO WANTS THAT?

05:34.459 --> 05:35.961
TAKE SOMETHING  FROM  SOMEONE--

05:36.003 --> 05:37.171
VALUE.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.173
UNBELIEVABLE.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.173
THIS IS NOT A GAME.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.174
(chair creaks)

05:40.215 --> 05:41.800
BUT IT COULD BE.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.970
OOH. JAMES HAS BEEN SITTING

05:41.842 --> 05:44.970
IN THAT CHAIR THE WHOLE TIME?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.429
I'M INTRIGUED, JAMES.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.974
YOU TWO COULD COMPETE

05:46.471 --> 05:48.974
FOR THIS GUY. WHAT'S HIS NAME?

05:49.016 --> 05:50.600
DANIEL.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.600
NO EARTHLY IDEA.

05:50.642 --> 05:52.102
I'LL SET THE RULES,

05:50.642 --> 05:52.102
INCORPORATING THE IDEAS

05:52.144 --> 05:53.854
THAT I WANTED TO USE

05:52.144 --> 05:53.854
IN BELGIUM.

05:53.895 --> 05:55.438
AND IF IT WORKS,

05:55.480 --> 05:56.481
I'LL PITCH IT AS A TV SHOW

05:55.480 --> 05:56.481
AND HOST IT MYSELF.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.859
NO! YOU CAN'T TOY

05:56.523 --> 05:58.859
WITH A PERSON LIKE THAT.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.237
BESIDES, I WOULD NEVER COMPETE

05:58.900 --> 06:02.237
AGAINST CHLOE FOR A GUY.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.489
THE FIRST THING SHE'D DO

06:02.279 --> 06:04.489
IS JUST SLEEP WITH HIM.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.573
YOU KNOW IT.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.408
WELL, JUNE,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.408
AS IT JUST SO HAPPENS,

06:07.450 --> 06:09.661
ONE OF MY RULES IS NO SEX

06:07.450 --> 06:09.661
FOR THE FIRST FIVE DATES.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.496
THAT WAY CHLOE CAN'T GAIN

06:09.703 --> 06:11.496
AN UNFAIR ADVANTAGE.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.664
BOO.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.415
SO BASICALLY,

06:12.706 --> 06:14.415
EITHER I DON'T PLAY,

06:14.457 --> 06:17.669
IN WHICH CASE CHLOE SLEEPS WITH

06:14.457 --> 06:17.669
DANIEL AND MAKES HIM UNDATABLE,

06:17.711 --> 06:20.339
OR I ACTUALLY PLAY, AND I HAVE

06:17.711 --> 06:20.339
A CHANCE TO DATE HIM.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.923
GREAT. YOU'RE IN.

06:20.379 --> 06:21.923
YEAH, WELL, I'M OUT.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.259
NO SEX FOR FIVE DATES

06:21.965 --> 06:24.259
SOUNDS LIKE TORTURE.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.802
AWESOME. SO I GET DANIEL.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.679
NO. YOU WANT HIM? HE'S MINE.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.679
I'M BACK IN. VALUE!

06:27.721 --> 06:29.264
PERFECT! OKAY.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.433
(deep voice) LET'S MINGLE

06:29.306 --> 06:32.433
WHILE WE'RE SINGLE.

06:33.518 --> 06:34.435
THAT'S HOW THE GAME STARTS.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.520
THE GAME

06:34.477 --> 06:35.520
JUST OFFICIALLY STARTED.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.064
THAT WASN'T CLEAR.

06:37.105 --> 06:38.106
(door slams)

06:43.278 --> 06:45.446
OKAY, SO HERE ARE

06:43.278 --> 06:45.446
THE BASIC RULES OF THE GAME--

06:45.488 --> 06:47.657
DANIEL CANNOT KNOW

06:45.488 --> 06:47.657
YOU'RE COMPETING FOR HIM.

06:47.699 --> 06:49.910
YOU WILL EACH GO

06:47.699 --> 06:49.910
ON FIVE PLATONIC DATES.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.619
YOU WILL EACH GET

06:49.951 --> 06:51.619
AN INTERRUPTION CARD,

06:51.661 --> 06:54.039
A COOL-DOWN CARD,

06:51.661 --> 06:54.039
AND A MONKEY WRENCH CARD

06:54.081 --> 06:55.456
WHICH CAN BE PLAYED

06:54.081 --> 06:55.456
AT ANY TIME.

06:55.498 --> 06:56.499
YOU HAD CARDS MADE UP?

06:56.541 --> 06:57.500
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?

06:57.542 --> 06:58.752
I CAN'T TAKE ALL THE CREDIT.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.129
THE WOMAN AT KINKO'S

06:58.793 --> 07:01.129
HAD SOME GREAT THOUGHTS.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.130
QUESTION.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.130
YES.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.257
CAN WE PUNCH LUTHER?

07:03.298 --> 07:05.508
NO.

07:03.298 --> 07:05.508
SO AT THE END OF EACH DATE,

07:05.550 --> 07:07.468
I WILL COUNT OUT THE NUMBER

07:05.550 --> 07:07.468
OF TRUE CONNECTION MOMENTS

07:07.510 --> 07:09.054
YOU EACH HAVE WITH DANIEL.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.264
WHOEVER HAS THE MOST

07:09.096 --> 07:10.264
WINS THE ROUND,

07:10.305 --> 07:12.349
AND GETS... BEEK BUCKS

07:12.391 --> 07:13.850
TO USE ON THEIR NEXT DATE.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.476
THESE ARE FROM

07:13.892 --> 07:15.476
THE VAN DER BEEK MONOPOLY SET

07:15.518 --> 07:16.477
I MADE LAST EASTER.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.272
LUTHER, YOU ARE ON IT TODAY.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.147
I GOT GREAT SLEEP

07:18.313 --> 07:19.147
LAST NIGHT.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.859
(knocking on door)

07:22.901 --> 07:24.861
I WANNA PLAY. I DON'T EVEN CARE

07:22.901 --> 07:24.861
WHO THE GUY IS.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.363
I JUST WANNA

07:24.903 --> 07:26.363
PLAY A GAME WITH CHLOE.

07:26.405 --> 07:27.739
GREAT. DIVERSITY. GET IN HERE.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.657
EEE! (whispers) YES!

07:29.699 --> 07:30.658
(giggles)

07:30.700 --> 07:31.534
FORM AN ALLIANCE?

07:30.700 --> 07:31.534
NO.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.744
THIS IS GREAT.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.870
FOR THE FIRST ROUND,

07:33.912 --> 07:34.871
I NEED YOU TO WRITE DOWN

07:33.912 --> 07:34.871
YOUR IDEAL DATE

07:34.913 --> 07:35.872
ON THAT SHEET OF PAPER.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.957
(click)

07:36.998 --> 07:39.167
("Think!" from "Jeopardy!"

07:36.998 --> 07:39.167
playing)

07:39.209 --> 07:41.920
(clipboards clacking)

07:41.962 --> 07:43.504
SO...

07:43.546 --> 07:46.174
FOR YOUR FIRST DATE, JUNE,

07:46.216 --> 07:48.343
YOU WILL BE GOING...

07:46.216 --> 07:48.343
TO A DUNGEON.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.510
WAIT. I-I DIDN'T

07:48.385 --> 07:49.510
WRITE DOWN "DUNGEON."

07:49.552 --> 07:50.678
I WROTE DOWN "PICNIC."

07:50.720 --> 07:51.888
YOU AND CHLOE

07:50.720 --> 07:51.888
ARE SWITCHING DATES.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.889
NO!

07:52.931 --> 07:54.515
GOD. I'M WEIRDLY INTO THIS.

07:54.557 --> 07:55.683
I KNEW THE WHOLE THING

07:54.557 --> 07:55.683
WAS CRAZY,

07:55.725 --> 07:58.103
BUT I REALLY LIKED DANIEL.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.147
I MEAN, WE ONLY CHATTED

07:58.145 --> 08:00.147
FOR A FEW MINUTES IN THE BAR,

08:00.188 --> 08:01.815
BUT I HADN'T FELT

08:00.188 --> 08:01.815
A CONNECTION LIKE THAT

08:01.856 --> 08:04.401
WITH SOMEONE IN A LONG TIME.

08:04.443 --> 08:07.446
SO I GUESS

08:04.443 --> 08:07.446
I'M GOING ON A DATE...

08:07.487 --> 08:08.571
IN A DUNGEON.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.031
I HAVE A VENT

08:08.613 --> 08:10.031
IN MY APARTMENT

08:10.073 --> 08:12.826
THAT LETS ME HEAR EVERYTHING

08:10.073 --> 08:12.826
GOING ON IN APARTMENT 23.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.535
IT'S WEIRD THEY NEVER ASK ME

08:14.577 --> 08:16.704
HOW I ALWAYS KNOW

08:14.577 --> 08:16.704
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

08:16.746 --> 08:20.459
OR HOW I'VE TRAINED MY BODY

08:16.746 --> 08:20.459
TO GET ON CHLOE'S CYCLE.

08:20.500 --> 08:25.005
(techno music playing)

08:26.173 --> 08:29.134
SO... THIS IS A DUNGEON.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.551
YEAH.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.554
I KNOW, IT'S...

08:30.593 --> 08:33.554
IT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.724
NO. I'M JUST SURPRISED

08:33.596 --> 08:36.724
YOU CHOSE THIS PLACE.

08:36.766 --> 08:38.226
GOOD SURPRISED?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.560
MORE LIKE

08:39.602 --> 08:42.063
"WHY DID I WEAR LOAFERS

08:39.602 --> 08:42.063
TO A DUNGEON?" SURPRISED.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.190
(laughs)

08:43.231 --> 08:44.565
HEY, ARE YOU READY

08:43.231 --> 08:44.565
FOR ANOTHER ONE?

08:44.607 --> 08:46.443
YES, PLEASE.

08:48.487 --> 08:50.571
CARD. CARD. MONKEY CARD.

08:50.613 --> 08:52.240
I INTERRUPT

08:50.613 --> 08:52.240
YOUR DATE WITH CARDS.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.450
GET OUTTA HERE.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.618
DANIEL AND I JUST GOT HERE.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.618
I AM NOT LEAVING.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.412
UM, THOSE ARE THE RULES

08:55.660 --> 08:57.412
OF THE GAME, JUNE.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.039
DO YOU REALLY WANNA

08:57.454 --> 08:59.039
BREAK THE RULES OF THE GAME?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.248
I DIDN'T KNOW

08:59.080 --> 09:00.248
THE RULES OF THE GAME.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.583
I JUST WANTED

09:00.290 --> 09:02.583
TO SLAM DOWN THE CARDS AND YELL.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.419
I HATE GAMES.

09:06.505 --> 09:07.588
(gasps) DANIEL.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.257
CHLOE.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.010
WOW. THAT IS SO WEIRD

09:09.299 --> 09:12.010
RUNNING INTO YOU HERE.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.095
WE'RE SEEING EACH OTHER

09:12.052 --> 09:14.095
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

09:14.137 --> 09:15.596
YEP, AND THE GIRL

09:14.137 --> 09:15.596
THAT YOU WERE WITH,

09:15.638 --> 09:17.516
SHE ASKED ME TO TELL YOU

09:15.638 --> 09:17.516
SHE HAD AN EMERGENCY.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.642
SHE RAN OUT OF HERE

09:17.557 --> 09:19.642
HOLDING HER MOUTH AND HER BUTT.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.643
OH, MY GOD.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.853
ANYWAY, ENOUGH ABOUT HER.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.398
I'M HERE NOW,

09:21.895 --> 09:24.398
AND THIS COUNTS AS A DATE.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.233
ONLY FOUR MORE UNTIL SEX.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.446
MY MAN!

09:34.241 --> 09:36.826
SO... IT'S GOING WELL.

09:36.868 --> 09:38.619
IT'S A LITTLE PREDICTABLE.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.621
I JUST... (sighs) IT'S GOOD.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.621
IT'S NOT GREAT.

09:40.663 --> 09:41.706
I FEEL LIKE I NEED

09:40.663 --> 09:41.706
TO SHAKE THINGS UP, YOU KNOW?

09:41.748 --> 09:44.501
THROW A CURVEBALL AT 'EM

09:41.748 --> 09:44.501
OR SOMETHING.

09:44.543 --> 09:45.668
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.879
DATING SHOW I'M WORKSHOPPING

09:45.710 --> 09:47.879
WITH JUNE AND CHLOE.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.131
I'M REALLY ON TO SOMETHING

09:47.921 --> 09:50.131
WITH THIS SHOW IDEA,

09:50.173 --> 09:51.632
I JUST--

09:50.173 --> 09:51.632
I'M MISSING SOMETHING.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.301
YOU WATCH DATING SHOWS.

09:51.674 --> 09:53.301
ANY IDEAS?

09:53.343 --> 09:55.470
YOU WANT ME TO HELP

09:53.343 --> 09:55.470
SET JUNE UP ON DATES?

09:55.512 --> 09:58.432
THAT'S THE EXACT OPPOSITE

09:55.512 --> 09:58.432
OF SOMETHING I'D BE INTO.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.807
WAIT, YOU STILL HAVE

09:58.473 --> 09:59.807
A CRUSH ON HER?

09:59.849 --> 10:01.101
IT HASN'T BEEN THAT LONG.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.643
IT'S BEEN, LIKE,

10:01.142 --> 10:02.643
THE LONGEST CRUSH OF ALL TIME.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.979
I'VE HAD ABOUT TEN CRUSHES

10:02.685 --> 10:04.979
SINCE YOURS STARTED.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.482
11.

10:08.691 --> 10:10.444
(dog barks)

10:10.485 --> 10:13.613
(people shouting playfully)

10:16.074 --> 10:18.826
THIS SUCKS.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.828
THIS PICNIC

10:18.868 --> 10:20.828
WAS YOUR IDEA.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.663
WHY'D YOU ONLY BRING

10:20.870 --> 10:22.663
ONE CHAIR?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.250
DANIEL, I DON'T...

10:25.292 --> 10:26.667
I DON'T KNOW, DANIEL.

10:26.709 --> 10:29.379
DO YOU WANT

10:26.709 --> 10:29.379
SOME FOOD OR SOMETHING?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.673
WHISKEY?

10:32.715 --> 10:33.674
AN EGG?

10:33.716 --> 10:36.677
AN EGG, I GUESS.

10:36.719 --> 10:37.762
(exhales deeply)

10:39.598 --> 10:40.681
(cracks)

10:39.598 --> 10:40.681
OH!

10:40.723 --> 10:43.143
GOD! IT'S NOT EVEN

10:40.723 --> 10:43.143
HARD-BOILED!

10:43.184 --> 10:44.060
WHAT?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.187
ANYWAY, THIS COUNTS

10:44.102 --> 10:46.187
AS A DATE.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.898
ONLY THREE MORE

10:46.229 --> 10:48.898
UNTIL SEX.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.691
OH, AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE,

10:50.733 --> 10:53.694
THIS CHAIR HAS TO BE RETURNED

10:50.733 --> 10:53.694
TO TONY'S PARTY RENTALS.

10:53.736 --> 10:54.904
YOU OWE HIM 50 BUCKS.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.616
HIS PRICES

10:54.946 --> 10:57.616
ARE PRETTY UNREASONABLE.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.703
OKAY, LADIES,

11:02.745 --> 11:04.122
NOW AT THIS POINT

11:02.745 --> 11:04.122
IN THE GAME,

11:04.164 --> 11:05.373
NONE OF YOU HAVE SCORED

11:04.164 --> 11:05.373
ANY TRUE CONNECTION MOMENTS

11:05.415 --> 11:06.583
WITH DANIEL.

11:06.625 --> 11:07.708
I WOULD'VE HAD ONE

11:07.750 --> 11:09.210
IF CHLOE HADN'T

11:07.750 --> 11:09.210
INTERRUPTED MY DATE.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.712
NOW, ROBIN, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN

11:09.252 --> 11:11.712
TRIED TO MEET DANIEL YET.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.755
UH, I KNOW.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.757
I'VE GOT DUDES

11:12.797 --> 11:14.757
COMIN' OUT OF MY EARS.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.883
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

11:15.925 --> 11:18.011
I AM THE ONLY ONE

11:15.925 --> 11:18.011
WHO LIKES THIS GUY.

11:18.052 --> 11:19.720
WELL, NOW HERE IS

11:18.052 --> 11:19.720
YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.306
OUR NEXT CHALLENGE

11:19.762 --> 11:21.306
IS A QUIZ ROUND,

11:21.348 --> 11:23.766
SPONSORED BY

11:21.348 --> 11:23.766
DIET DR. PEPPER.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.726
DR. PEPPER LOVES EVERYTHING

11:23.808 --> 11:25.726
I GET INVOLVED WITH.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.187
JAMES VAN DER BEEK

11:25.768 --> 11:27.187

11:27.228 --> 11:29.189
D.D.P., J.V.D.B.

11:29.230 --> 11:31.191
THIS CHALLENGE IS DESIGNED

11:29.230 --> 11:31.191
TO DETERMINE

11:31.232 --> 11:33.151
WHICH OF YOU HAS

11:31.232 --> 11:33.151
THE BRAINS TO BE WITH DANIEL.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.029
THE WINNER WILL GAIN

11:33.193 --> 11:36.029
A VERY SPECIAL ADVANTAGE

11:36.070 --> 11:37.364
OVER THE OTHER CONTESTANTS.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.782
THIS IS MY CONCEPT

11:37.405 --> 11:39.782
THAT JAMES HAS AGREED TO TRY.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.034
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

11:41.075 --> 11:42.369
IT'S CALLED

11:42.410 --> 11:44.745
"THINGS LUTHER KNOWS,

11:42.410 --> 11:44.745
BUT WANTS TO SEE IF YOU KNOW."

11:44.787 --> 11:46.039
(clacks)

11:44.787 --> 11:46.039
THE MOVIE "THE HELP"!

11:50.460 --> 11:52.795
OKAY. FIRST QUESTION.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.381
WHICH PLANET

11:52.837 --> 11:54.381
IN OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
GETS HIT

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
WITH THE MOST ASTEROIDS?

11:55.798 --> 11:56.757
(clacks)

11:55.798 --> 11:56.757
I HAVE NO IDEA!

11:56.799 --> 11:57.634
(clacks)

11:56.799 --> 11:57.634
I HAVE NO IDEA, EITHER.

11:57.676 --> 11:58.759
WE ARE THE SAME.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.220
ONLY BUZZ IN

11:58.801 --> 12:00.220
IF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER.

12:00.261 --> 12:01.137
OKAY.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.347
WHO WAS THAT GUY

12:02.389 --> 12:03.806
IN THE BLACK-AND-WHITE

12:02.389 --> 12:03.806
JANET JACKSON VIDEO

12:03.848 --> 12:06.767
IN THE DESERT WHO BALANCED

12:03.848 --> 12:06.767
ON THAT BIG HALF-CIRCLE THING?

12:06.809 --> 12:07.768
(clacks)

12:06.809 --> 12:07.768
I HAVE NO IDEA!

12:07.810 --> 12:08.769
(clacks)

12:07.810 --> 12:08.769
I DON'T KNOW, EITHER.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.021
DJIMON HOUNSOU.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.021
I KNEW THAT!

12:10.063 --> 12:11.772
JAMES ANSWERED

12:10.063 --> 12:11.772
BEFORE I HAD A CHANCE.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.773
TOUGH TO PROVE.

12:12.815 --> 12:14.025
OKAY, LET'S WRAP

12:12.815 --> 12:14.025
THIS ROUND UP.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.485
WHOEVER ANSWERS

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
(clacks)

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
THE MOVIE "THE HELP."

12:19.489 --> 12:20.365
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT!

12:20.407 --> 12:21.658
CHLOE WINS THE GAME.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.658
YES!

12:21.700 --> 12:23.159
MINNY PUT POOP IN THE PIE.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.161
DAMN IT. I TOOK OUT

12:23.201 --> 12:25.161

12:25.203 --> 12:26.787
CHLOE, AS WINNER

12:25.203 --> 12:26.787

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
YOU WILL RECEIVE

12:26.829 --> 12:28.789
THE VALUABLE...

12:28.831 --> 12:30.458
MIND FORK.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.377
(gasps)

12:30.500 --> 12:32.377
IN A MUCH-NEEDED TWIST,

12:32.419 --> 12:34.295
THE MIND FORK

12:32.419 --> 12:34.295
WILL ALLOW YOU ACCESS

12:34.337 --> 12:35.963
TO ONE PIECE

12:34.337 --> 12:35.963
OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

12:36.005 --> 12:38.717
DESIGNED TO BLOW

12:36.005 --> 12:38.717
ONE OF THE CONTESTANT'S MINDS.

12:38.757 --> 12:41.052
I GIVE IT TO JUNE RIGHT NOW.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.387
(laughs) OKAY!

12:42.429 --> 12:43.888
ALL RIGHT. I LIKE IT.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.183
JUNE, YOUR MIND-BLOWING PIECE

12:43.930 --> 12:47.183
OF INFORMATION IS,

12:47.225 --> 12:49.436
MARK...

12:49.477 --> 12:50.978
HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.855
(gasps) OOH.

12:52.897 --> 12:55.275
YOU JUST GOT

12:52.897 --> 12:55.275
MIND FORKED.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.401
(imitates explosion)

12:56.443 --> 12:57.444
(door slams)

13:01.864 --> 13:03.700
WHAT? NO.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.118
MARK DOESN'T HAVE

13:03.742 --> 13:05.118
A CRUSH ON ME.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.035
YOU GUYS MADE THAT UP

13:06.077 --> 13:07.704
AS PART OF

13:06.077 --> 13:07.704
A TWIST IN THE GAME.

13:07.746 --> 13:08.829
I MEAN, RIGHT?

13:08.871 --> 13:11.207
OOH, THE MIND FORK

13:08.871 --> 13:11.207
IS WORKING!

13:11.249 --> 13:12.709
(knock on door)

13:14.335 --> 13:17.213
HEY. UH, YOU LEFT

13:14.335 --> 13:17.213
YOUR WALLET AT BEANS.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.214
AH. YES, I DID.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.508
ON PURPOSE? TOUGH TO PROVE.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.009
POINT IS, YOU'RE HERE.

13:22.051 --> 13:24.845
JUNE. MARK'S HERE.

13:24.887 --> 13:26.514
HEY, MARK.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.099
FUNKY MARK.

13:28.141 --> 13:29.559
I WAS JUST LEAVIN'.

13:29.601 --> 13:31.936
OUT THE DOOR,

13:29.601 --> 13:31.936
FOUR-ON-THE-FLOOR.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.314
OKAY. UH, ARE--

13:31.978 --> 13:34.314
ARE WE STILL ON

13:34.355 --> 13:35.856
FOR THE "SPRING INTO MAY"

13:34.355 --> 13:35.856
FINALE TOMORROW?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.651
(squeals) YEAH!

13:37.692 --> 13:38.859
NASTY!

13:38.901 --> 13:40.695
(slaps)

13:40.737 --> 13:42.656
BUTTOCKS.

13:42.697 --> 13:43.864
MIND FORKED.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.325
I WAS FLUSTERED.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
IF MARK REALLY DID

13:45.366 --> 13:46.867
HAVE A CRUSH ON ME--

13:46.909 --> 13:48.911
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

13:46.909 --> 13:48.911
IS A BIG "IF"--

13:48.953 --> 13:50.789
I COULDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT

13:48.953 --> 13:50.789
RIGHT THEN.

13:50.829 --> 13:51.872
I HAD TO FOCUS ON DANIEL

13:51.914 --> 13:52.873
AND THE NEXT CHALLENGE.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.875
WE WERE MEETING

13:52.915 --> 13:54.875
DANIEL'S GREAT AUNT.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.753
WE HAD TO GET HER

13:54.917 --> 13:56.753
TO SAY WHICH GIRL

13:56.795 --> 13:58.879
SHE THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR DANIEL.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.175
BUT I WAS JUST HAPPY

13:58.921 --> 14:02.175
TO SPLIT A POTPIE WITH CHLOE.

14:02.216 --> 14:03.884
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

14:02.216 --> 14:03.884
WE CAN'T SPLIT IT?

14:03.926 --> 14:05.679
MA'AM. IT'S A POT PIE.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.138
ALL THE STUFF INSIDE IT

14:05.720 --> 14:07.138
WILL SPILL OUT.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.682
WHY IS IT

14:07.180 --> 14:08.682
JUST PROBLEMS WITH YOU?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.809
SO DANIEL SEEMS

14:08.723 --> 14:10.809
LIKE A REALLY GREAT GUY,

14:10.849 --> 14:13.311
AND HE LOVES YOU VERY MUCH.

14:10.849 --> 14:13.311
(oxygen tank hisses)

14:13.353 --> 14:15.563
I LIKE YOUR... FACE HAT.

14:15.605 --> 14:16.939
(hisses)

14:16.981 --> 14:18.775
I'D REALLY LIKE THE CHANCE

14:16.981 --> 14:18.775
TO GET TO KNOW HIM BETTER,

14:18.817 --> 14:20.610
SO IF YOU COULD JUST--

14:18.817 --> 14:20.610
OKAY.

14:20.652 --> 14:21.902
ARE YOU READY

14:20.652 --> 14:21.902
FOR THE NEXT TWIST?

14:21.944 --> 14:25.198
BECAUSE HERE COMES

14:21.944 --> 14:25.198
THE DOUBLE MIND FORK.

14:25.239 --> 14:26.949
DANIEL.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.368
AUNT AGGIE, ARE YOU OKAY?

14:28.409 --> 14:30.495
YOU CAN'T EAT ANYTHING HERE.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.413
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU TWO?

14:32.455 --> 14:36.083
I-I GET A PHONE CALL

14:32.455 --> 14:36.083
FROM JAMES VAN DER BEEK,

14:36.125 --> 14:37.960
TELLING ME THAT YOU STOLE

14:36.125 --> 14:37.960
MY GREAT AUNT

14:38.002 --> 14:39.754
FROM HER RETIREMENT HOME?

14:39.796 --> 14:41.798
I-I HAD NO IDEA

14:39.796 --> 14:41.798
YOU TWO EVEN KNEW EACH OTHER.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.550
AND NOW I FIND OUT

14:41.840 --> 14:43.550
YOU'RE PLAYING

14:43.591 --> 14:46.177
SOME SICK,

14:43.591 --> 14:46.177
REAL-LIFE DATING GAME?

14:46.219 --> 14:49.138
HI. I'M ROBIN.

14:46.219 --> 14:49.138
I'M COMPETING FOR YOU, TOO.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.558
P.S., I'M NOT

14:49.180 --> 14:51.558
ATTRACTED TO YOU.

14:52.559 --> 14:53.393
DANIEL, I'M SO SORRY.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.811
I THOUGHT THIS WAS

14:53.434 --> 14:54.811
THE ONLY WAY

14:54.853 --> 14:56.521
THAT I'D HAVE

14:54.853 --> 14:56.521
A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.565
WELL, THEN, YOU'RE CRAZY.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.942
THIS IS CRAZY.

14:58.606 --> 15:01.942
YOU'RE ALL INSANE.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.027
OH, MY GOSH.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.738
I SHOULD HAVE

15:03.069 --> 15:04.738
NEVER LISTENED TO YOU.

15:04.779 --> 15:06.947
I LIKE THIS GUY,

15:04.779 --> 15:06.947
AND NOW IT'S ALL RUINED,

15:06.989 --> 15:08.949
BECAUSE OF YOU.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.949
HEY.

15:08.991 --> 15:09.950
I LIKED HIM, TOO.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.952
ONLY BECAUSE  I  LIKED HIM.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.204
AND ROBIN'S HERE

15:11.994 --> 15:13.204
BECAUSE OF YOU,

15:13.246 --> 15:15.623
AND JAMES IS HERE

15:13.246 --> 15:15.623
BECAUSE OF HIS STUPID GAME.

15:15.665 --> 15:17.375
IT IS STUPID.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.959
I'M SORRY, JAMES,

15:19.001 --> 15:21.003
BUT IT IS A DUMB GAME.

15:21.045 --> 15:25.966
THIS ISN'T CONNECTED

15:21.045 --> 15:25.966
TO ANYTHING. (cries)

15:26.008 --> 15:27.468
OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

15:27.510 --> 15:28.969
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER LET YOU

15:27.510 --> 15:28.969
TALK ME INTO SOMETHING

15:29.011 --> 15:32.807
SO DISHONEST AND MEAN.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.975
(exhales deeply)

15:36.477 --> 15:39.647
OKAY, AUNT AGGIE,

15:36.477 --> 15:39.647
EVERYTHING IS FINE NOW.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.982
BLAH! WHOA. IT SMELLS

15:39.689 --> 15:41.982
LIKE NUTS IN HERE.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.569
WHAT? I THOUGHT

15:42.024 --> 15:44.569
I MADE MYSELF CLEAR.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.029
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING

15:44.611 --> 15:47.029
TO DO WITH YOU.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.573
FIRST OF ALL,

15:47.071 --> 15:48.573
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.618
AND SECOND, I'M NOT HERE FOR ME.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.618
I'M HERE FOR JUNE.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.995
LOOK, SHE DIDN'T WANT ANYTHING

15:51.659 --> 15:54.995
TO DO WITH THIS STUPID GAME.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.832
SHE JUST WANTED TO DATE YOU

15:55.037 --> 15:57.832
IN A NORMAL, BORING WAY,

15:57.874 --> 15:59.793
AND JAMES AND I

15:57.874 --> 15:59.793
DIDN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

15:59.834 --> 16:01.001
SO SHE DESERVES

15:59.834 --> 16:01.001
ANOTHER CHANCE.

16:01.043 --> 16:04.004
DON'T BE MAD AT HER

16:01.043 --> 16:04.004
FOR WHAT WE DID.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.214
LOOK, I'M SORRY,

16:05.256 --> 16:06.841
BUT JUNE DIDN'T HAVE TO

16:05.256 --> 16:06.841
GO ALONG WITH IT

16:06.883 --> 16:07.842
IF SHE DIDN'T WANT TO.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.009
NOW PLEASE LEAVE

16:09.051 --> 16:11.011
SO I CAN FORGET

16:09.051 --> 16:11.011
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

16:11.053 --> 16:12.639
(Aggie speaks indistinctly)

16:12.680 --> 16:14.014
WHAT?

16:14.056 --> 16:15.015
OH, THAT THING TALKS?

16:16.058 --> 16:19.646
JUNE'S A GOOD GIRL.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.646
GO TO HER.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.232
CAN YOU BELIEVE

16:20.980 --> 16:23.232
THE OLD LADY SAID "GO TO HER"?

16:23.274 --> 16:26.026
I MEAN...

16:23.274 --> 16:26.026
THAT'S GREAT TELEVISION.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.028
I DON'T KNOW

16:26.068 --> 16:28.028
WHAT LUTHER'S TALKING ABOUT.

16:28.070 --> 16:29.906
MY SHOW'S INCREDIBLE.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.034
(door opens)

16:32.659 --> 16:34.034
MARK,

16:34.076 --> 16:36.412
I GOT A HIT ON MY HANDS.

16:36.454 --> 16:37.831
ALL THE TWISTS AND TURNS...

16:37.872 --> 16:40.500
THE MIND FORK REALLY TOOK

16:37.872 --> 16:40.500
THE WHOLE GAME TO ANOTHER LEVEL

16:40.541 --> 16:42.961
WHEN I TOLD JUNE

16:40.541 --> 16:42.961
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON HER.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.045
YOU TOLD JUNE

16:43.002 --> 16:45.045
I HAVE A CRUSH ON HER?

16:45.087 --> 16:46.756
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

16:46.798 --> 16:49.049
OH, DUDE...

16:49.091 --> 16:50.259
IT HELPED MY GAME.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.761
WELL, THAT'S MESSED UP, MAN!

16:51.803 --> 16:53.220
YOUR GAME

16:51.803 --> 16:53.220
ISN'T EVEN REAL.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.431
I...

16:53.262 --> 16:55.431
WH-WHAT DID SHE SAY?

16:55.473 --> 16:56.891
WELL, NOT MUCH, REALLY.

16:56.933 --> 16:59.059
I MEAN, SHE GOT BACK

16:56.933 --> 16:59.059
ON DANIEL PRETTY QUICK.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.060
(scoffs)

16:59.101 --> 17:00.060
SHE'S FINE.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.939
OH, GOOD,

17:00.102 --> 17:02.939
'CAUSE I'M FINE, TOO.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.107
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO WATCH

17:02.981 --> 17:05.107
THE FINALE OF "SPRING INTO MAY"

17:05.149 --> 17:08.695
TOGETHER TONIGHT,

17:05.149 --> 17:08.695
AND THAT'LL BEFINE...  TOO.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.070

17:10.112 --> 17:11.948

17:11.990 --> 17:15.159
TRIVIA... FORK."

17:16.494 --> 17:19.079
I DON'T HAVE IT YET.

17:16.494 --> 17:19.079
I DON'T HAVE THE NAME, MARK.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.582
I'M GONNA GO FOR A RUN.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.960
(bells jingle)

17:26.838 --> 17:28.589
(cell phone chimes and vibrates)

17:36.138 --> 17:37.390
(clatters)

17:37.431 --> 17:38.975
(knock on door)

17:41.435 --> 17:44.104
DANIEL.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.104
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.272
CHLOE AND AUNT AGGIE

17:45.314 --> 17:47.107
CONVINCED ME

17:45.314 --> 17:47.107
TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.360
CHLOE?  MY  CHLOE?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.111
I WAS UPSET.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.531
I DON'T APPRECIATE BEING A PAWN

17:51.153 --> 17:53.531
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S GAME.

17:53.573 --> 17:56.743
BUT I LIKE YOU, AND YOU SEEM

17:53.573 --> 17:56.743
LIKE A GOOD PERSON.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.160
I'M SORRY.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.829
NO MORE GAMES.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.749
JUST ME AND YOU,

17:59.871 --> 18:02.749
I PROMISE.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.625
COME IN. I'M ACTUALLY

18:02.790 --> 18:04.625
WATCHING THE SEASON FINALE

18:04.667 --> 18:05.919
OF "SPRING INTO MAY,"

18:05.960 --> 18:08.922
AND MAY IS ABOUT TO GIVE OUT

18:05.960 --> 18:08.922
HER FINAL GOLDEN SPRING.

18:08.963 --> 18:10.590
I KNOW IT'S STUPID,

18:08.963 --> 18:10.590
BUT IT'S FUN.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.299
DO YOU WANT A BURRITO?

18:12.341 --> 18:14.134
OH, GOD, NO.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.134
I HATE BURRITOS.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.135
WHY WOULD I LIKE A FOOD

18:15.177 --> 18:16.804
THAT HIDES ALL ITS INGREDIENTS

18:15.177 --> 18:16.804
FROM VIEW?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.848
IT'S LIKE, LET'S BUY

18:16.846 --> 18:18.848
A PAIR OF SHOES

18:18.890 --> 18:21.141
AND JUST KEEP 'EM

18:18.890 --> 18:21.141
IN THE BOX.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.852
IT'S REALLY NOT

18:21.183 --> 18:22.852
THE SAME THING.

18:22.894 --> 18:23.937
IT KIND OF IS.

18:23.978 --> 18:25.145
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY...

18:25.187 --> 18:26.522
IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO...

18:26.564 --> 18:28.066
YOU KNOW, WHY AM I

18:26.564 --> 18:28.066
DEFENDING BURRITOS?

18:28.107 --> 18:29.984
WE ARE MISSING THE SHOW.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.235
(DVR bloops)

18:30.026 --> 18:31.235
SO, MAY,

18:31.277 --> 18:32.612
YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE

18:31.277 --> 18:32.612
TO THINK IT ALL THROUGH.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.780
WHO'S IT GONNA BE?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.155
(pounding)

18:35.197 --> 18:38.158
IT'S KIND OF FUN IF YOU DO THIS,

18:35.197 --> 18:38.158
GET INTO IT.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.535
THAT'S PRETTY WEIRD.

18:39.577 --> 18:41.871
♪♪♪

18:41.913 --> 18:44.373
COULD HE HAVE WARNED MAY

18:41.913 --> 18:44.373
ANY DIFFERENTLY?

18:44.415 --> 18:46.166
SO IS THAT

18:44.415 --> 18:46.166
HER BOYFRIEND OR SOMETHING?

18:46.208 --> 18:47.752
NO, THAT--THAT'S THE HOST.

18:47.794 --> 18:50.964
IT STARTED AS 24 MEN,

18:47.794 --> 18:50.964
THEN DOWN TO...

18:51.005 --> 18:53.633
SO IS SHE, LIKE,

18:51.005 --> 18:53.633
A FAMOUS PERSON OR...

18:53.674 --> 18:55.551
SHE'S--SHE'S A REGULAR GIRL.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.178
BUT CAN YOU JUST BE QUIET,

18:55.593 --> 18:58.178
THOUGH, SO WE CAN HEAR?

18:58.220 --> 19:00.014
RIGHT. GOT IT.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.182
...MAKE HER FINAL DECISION

19:00.056 --> 19:02.182
AS TO WHO...

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
HEY, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
TO EAT BESIDES BURRITOS?

19:04.310 --> 19:06.395
AND OBVIOUSLY

19:04.310 --> 19:06.395
NOT AN EGG ROLL,

19:06.437 --> 19:07.855
'CAUSE... SAME ISSUE.

19:07.897 --> 19:09.565
COMING UP NEXT,

19:09.607 --> 19:12.151
WE'LL SEE WHICH LUCKY GUY

19:09.607 --> 19:12.151
SHE CHOOSES.STAY TUNED.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.239
I'M SORRY, DANIEL.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.785
I JUST REALIZED THERE'S

19:17.281 --> 19:20.785
SOMEWHERE ELSE I NEED TO BE.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.787
WHAT?

19:22.829 --> 19:24.831
I JUST DON'T THINK

19:22.829 --> 19:24.831
WE'RE GONNA WORK OUT.

19:26.415 --> 19:28.001
HI!

19:28.042 --> 19:29.877
WELL, HELLO, LOVEBIRDS.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.796
NO. (sighs) NO LOVEBIRDS.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.255
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK OUT.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.299
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH

19:33.297 --> 19:35.299
FOR HAVING A CHAT WITH HIM.

19:35.341 --> 19:36.592
THAT WAS VERY COOL OF YOU.

19:36.634 --> 19:38.218
I'M PRETTY COOL.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.223
SO...

19:43.265 --> 19:45.143
YOU WANNA DO STUFF?

19:45.184 --> 19:46.268
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:46.310 --> 19:49.229

19:46.310 --> 19:49.229

19:51.732 --> 19:53.442
EVEN THOUGH JUNE DOESN'T

19:51.732 --> 19:53.442
WANT TO ANYMORE.

19:53.484 --> 19:55.153
(gasps) THAT'S GROWTH.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.655
(Robin, voice echoing) THAT  IS

19:55.194 --> 19:57.655
GROWTH. I'M PROUD OF YOU, CHLOE.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.239
THANKS, GOD!

19:59.281 --> 20:00.950

20:10.168 --> 20:12.252
YEAH. OF--OF COURSE.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.838
I COULDN'T WATCH THE FINALE

20:12.294 --> 20:13.838
WITHOUT YOU.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.256
IT JUST WOULDN'T BE THE SAME.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.634
MARK, WILL YOU ACCEPT...

20:18.676 --> 20:21.137
MY SILVER BURRITO?

20:21.179 --> 20:22.889
(laughs)

20:22.930 --> 20:24.891
I WILL. YES.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.894
(laughs)

20:27.935 --> 20:29.187
DID I MISS ANYTHING?

20:29.228 --> 20:32.148
YEAH, LIKE, 14 COMMERCIALS

20:29.228 --> 20:32.148
FOR FABRIC SOFTENER.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.316
SO MAY HASN'T GIVEN OUT

20:32.190 --> 20:34.316
HER FINAL GOLDEN SPRING?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.527
NO. THEY DRAG

20:34.358 --> 20:36.527
THESE THINGS OUT SO MUCH.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.363
YEAH. IT'S OKAY.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.199
I KIND OF

20:39.405 --> 20:41.199
NEVER WANT IT TO END.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.077
YEAH. ME, TOO.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.703
(chuckles)

20:45.745 --> 20:47.371
(man) DON'T FORGET

20:45.745 --> 20:47.371
TO TUNE IN THIS SEPTEMBER

20:47.413 --> 20:49.165
FOR THE PREMIERE

20:47.413 --> 20:49.165
OF "FALL INTO AUTUMN."

20:49.207 --> 20:50.208
(door slams)

20:53.794 --> 20:55.004
SO I DIDN'T BRING UP

20:55.046 --> 20:56.463
THE WHOLE "MARK HAVING

20:55.046 --> 20:56.463
A CRUSH ON ME" THING

20:56.505 --> 20:59.175
'CAUSE I FIGURED HE COULD

20:56.505 --> 20:59.175
TELL ME WHEN HE'S READY.

20:59.217 --> 21:02.970
FOR NOW, I JUST ENJOYED WATCHING

20:59.217 --> 21:02.970
THE SHOW WITH MY FRIEND.

21:03.012 --> 21:06.348
AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.143
I LITERALLY DIDN'T NEED

21:06.390 --> 21:09.143
ANY OF THAT INFORMATION.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.563
NONE OF IT.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.563
FROM ANY OF YOU.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.356
YOU'RE ALL HERE

21:12.605 --> 21:14.356
BECAUSE I WANNA KNOW

21:14.398 --> 21:16.316
WHAT HAPPENED TO DANIEL'S AUNT.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.318
NOW WHERE IS AGNES WHIPPLE?

21:18.360 --> 21:20.029
DANIEL TOOK HER BACK

21:18.360 --> 21:20.029
TO THE NURSING HOME,

21:20.071 --> 21:21.530
AND THAT'S THE LAST TIME

21:20.071 --> 21:21.530
WE SAW HER.

21:21.572 --> 21:23.323
WELL, SHE'S NOT THERE NOW.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.784
AGNES WHIPPLE IS MISSING.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.327
(pounding on window)

21:24.825 --> 21:27.327
(Daniel) WHERE IS SHE,

21:24.825 --> 21:27.327
YOU MONSTERS?!

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
THAT'S A WEIRD

21:27.369 --> 21:29.329
RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

21:29.371 --> 21:32.166
I MEAN,

21:29.371 --> 21:32.166
THEY'RE WAY TOO CLOSE.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.001
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
