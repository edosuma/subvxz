00:02.560 --> 00:05.400
Would you want to grow up here?
I have to.

00:05.400 --> 00:06.760
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.760 --> 00:10.880
I was just an average kid
until my first day of Junior High.

00:13.040 --> 00:16.920
One minute I'm walking home,
the next, there's a crash

00:16.920 --> 00:20.000
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:21.240 --> 00:24.480
And since then...
nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.840 --> 00:40.960
My best friend Ray
think it's cool.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.480
And my sister Annie
thinks I'm a science project.

00:45.040 --> 00:47.840
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.800
Not even my parents.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.160
I know the chemical plant
wants to find me

00:54.160 --> 00:56.080
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.400
But you know something?

00:57.400 --> 01:01.240
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:07.120 --> 01:09.720
When certain materials
dissolve in water

01:09.720 --> 01:14.320
they will dissociate into positively
and negatively charged ions.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.000
What do you call this solution?

01:17.480 --> 01:19.200
Mr. Alvarado?

01:22.440 --> 01:29.040
Um... I call this solution
beyond my comprehension.

01:29.040 --> 01:31.120
[students laughing]

01:31.120 --> 01:33.160
[bell rings]

01:33.160 --> 01:36.880
Projects in electricity
are due tomorrow.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.000
If it's late, you lose.

01:39.000 --> 01:43.440
Electricity is so insignificant
when you think about the big picture.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.240
I can't believe Krantz
carries a leather briefcase.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.520
Just another soldier in the war
against defenseless cows.

01:51.520 --> 01:54.080
I thought projects
were due Thursday.

01:54.080 --> 01:58.120
- Tomorrow is Thursday.
- Oh.

02:02.680 --> 02:05.320
Do you guys know
what you're doing yet?

02:05.320 --> 02:08.360
- Yep, mine's almost finished.
- Mine is, too.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.960
- Nicole hates it.
- Of course I do.

02:10.960 --> 02:13.920
- It's a killing machine.
- Hey, Don't tell them.

02:13.920 --> 02:17.240
Ray, please tell me you're as
lost as I am with this project.

02:17.240 --> 02:19.400
Sorry, Alex, no can do.

02:19.400 --> 02:24.320
I've got an idea just haven't
decided on the presentation.

02:24.320 --> 02:27.160
I wonder if Krantz
grades on a curve.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.760
- Krantz does not.
- And why should he?

02:30.760 --> 02:32.440
Oops!

02:32.440 --> 02:36.040
Your sister Annie's first
project was a phenomenon.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.360
She created
an electromagnetic field

02:38.360 --> 02:41.200
and floated metal objects in midair.

02:43.160 --> 02:47.960
[chemical solutions bubbling]

02:47.960 --> 02:49.160
Big deal!

02:49.160 --> 02:53.520
Your sister Annie did
the same experiment only better.

02:53.520 --> 02:57.160
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about this, Mr. Krantz?

02:57.160 --> 02:58.360
[whirring]

03:05.440 --> 03:07.880
[bird squawks]

03:15.840 --> 03:17.680
[crashes]

03:19.920 --> 03:23.120
[stammering]
I think I'm impressed.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.960
Your sister's magnificent.

03:26.960 --> 03:30.880
You can all learn a thing
or two from Alex's sister.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.880
- Thanks.
- What?

03:35.880 --> 03:38.840
- It's not my fault.
- Yeah, right.

03:49.800 --> 03:53.400
And the students are
enjoying the microscopes?

03:53.400 --> 03:54.880
That's great.

03:54.880 --> 04:00.200
Oh, please, helping young minds
grow is thanks enough.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.200
Oh, you did hire my two friends.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.600
Thanks so much.

04:04.600 --> 04:08.280
Yes, they'll be here
later this morning.

04:08.280 --> 04:11.680
That's right.
It's all set.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.520
Very good, Ms. Atron.

04:14.520 --> 04:17.839
- I agree with Vince.
- Very good.

04:18.600 --> 04:23.160
Vince, explain to me one more
time why this man is necessary.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.800
He drove the truck.

04:24.800 --> 04:29.320
And he's the only one who
can possibly identify the kid.

04:29.320 --> 04:32.720
I'm hoping something
will jog his mind.

04:34.560 --> 04:38.080
He's talking to a fake plant.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.000
- Mom?
- Hmm?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.040
If you had a choice
between losing your job

05:01.040 --> 05:03.360
and asking for help from someone

05:03.360 --> 05:07.520
who will use it against you
for the rest of your life...

05:07.520 --> 05:11.000
- what would you do?
- Hmm...

05:11.000 --> 05:14.720
I'd ask Annie to help me.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.800
Thanks.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.520
My very first science book.

05:23.520 --> 05:27.320
I haven't looked at this since
I was in the sandbox.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.600
Don't you have anything
with bigger print?

05:34.600 --> 05:36.440
Maybe a couple pictures...?

05:36.440 --> 05:38.920
It's boring if you don't
challenge yourself.

05:40.200 --> 05:44.400
Getting this done by tomorrow is
going to be enough of a challenge.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.280
It's so typical that you
waited until today to start.

05:50.200 --> 05:51.720
Never mind.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.840
Wait.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.280
Let's take a look
at some of my old projects.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.880
For inspiration.

06:10.440 --> 06:12.840
Um, hmm-- fourth grade:

06:12.840 --> 06:17.400
it demonstrates that
gravity is absolute.

06:18.480 --> 06:21.840
And, uh, this...
this is a mock-up of what atoms

06:21.840 --> 06:24.960
thrown together during
fusion would look like.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.600
It's not real, mind you.

06:26.600 --> 06:29.680
It's just what I think
they would look like.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.480
One day I'm going to prove it.

06:31.480 --> 06:35.840
- These are all great, Annie...
- Are you getting any ideas?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.480
Yeah, maybe.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.120
[Ray]
Hey, Alex... you in there?

06:45.120 --> 06:46.440
Coming. I got to go.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.880
Thanks for your help.

06:47.880 --> 06:51.520
- I'm going to the mall, want to come?
- She can't.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.320
She has to do
her science project tonight.

06:55.440 --> 06:58.800
- Well... I do need to buy supplies.
- That's great.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.160
You've decided
which one you're doing?

07:01.160 --> 07:07.120
Um, yeah...
it's one of your... earlier ones.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.520
Oh, that's so sweet.

07:09.520 --> 07:13.400
My project is perfection
in it's ingenious simplicity.

07:13.400 --> 07:17.800
- Wait till you see it.
- Ooh, I'm on pins and needles.

07:18.400 --> 07:20.520
Don't stay out too long, Alex.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.920
- You have a lot of work to do.
- Yes, Mom.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.000
Hey, I'm just warning you.

07:26.000 --> 07:28.960
Don't sweat me, Annie.
I'll be ready.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.160
[dog barking]

08:08.960 --> 08:12.640
[tape playing backwards]

08:13.760 --> 08:17.360
You should be very grateful
to Miss Atron, Dave.

08:17.360 --> 08:18.520
Why?

08:18.520 --> 08:22.600
Because she's given you this
oppoortunity to redeem yourself.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.280
That accident you were responsible for

08:25.280 --> 08:27.680
caused her a great deal of anguish.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.920
The fact that you're still here

08:29.920 --> 08:32.679
is testament to her
enormous generosity.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.240
What is she going to do, kill me?

08:35.240 --> 08:36.799
[laughs]

08:36.799 --> 08:40.360
[stops laughing]
Thank you, Vince.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.039
This isn't a gift, Dave.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.200
We're going to Atron Junior High
disguised as janitors.

08:46.200 --> 08:48.360
Once we infiltrate the premises

08:48.360 --> 08:51.040
we'll go on watch
to find the child.

08:51.040 --> 08:53.920
To be honest,
I don't know the first thing

08:53.920 --> 08:55.320
about being a janitor.

08:55.320 --> 08:58.600
You didn't know anything
about being a truck driver

08:58.600 --> 09:01.400
- but that didn't stop you.
- That's true.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.680
Okay, I'll take a shot.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.200
This isn't a matter of choice, Dave.

09:06.200 --> 09:10.040
What does a... janitor... do?

09:10.040 --> 09:11.400
It doesn't matter!

09:11.400 --> 09:14.520
Once we get there,
just keep your eyes open

09:14.520 --> 09:16.000
for something unusual

09:16.000 --> 09:19.480
any display of extraordinary
behavior or power.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.000
This child that we are looking for

09:22.000 --> 09:26.440
could possibly hold the secrets
to our future on this planet.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.640
Wow.

09:27.640 --> 09:31.920
I didn't know being a janitor
was such an exciting job.

09:31.920 --> 09:35.720
Just...
Get dressed, Dave.

09:57.080 --> 10:00.000
- Look at that!
- Do you see something?

10:00.000 --> 10:03.240
I can't believe they'd do that.

10:12.760 --> 10:14.480
Splendid, Miss Wilson.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.760
But wouldn't, uh, wood
be more aerodynamic?

10:17.760 --> 10:20.160
I'm sorry, but I don't believe

10:20.160 --> 10:26.240
that trees should suffer
unnecessarily nor should cows.

10:26.600 --> 10:29.840
I see. B-plus.

10:31.280 --> 10:32.840
[electric humming]

10:32.840 --> 10:36.120
And, uh, what have
we here, Miss Russo?

10:36.120 --> 10:39.920
It's an electrically powered
insect death-trap.

10:39.920 --> 10:43.320
Once the insects smell
the grains of sugar

10:43.320 --> 10:45.200
they enter through here

10:45.200 --> 10:49.080
and when they cross
the charged pad-- zap!

10:49.080 --> 10:55.400
- They move on to their next life.
- Creative use of current.

10:55.400 --> 10:55.880
A.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.520
It's a demonstration
of static electricity.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.960
- See.
- [class giggling]

11:06.960 --> 11:08.760
C-minus.

11:15.320 --> 11:18.920
- They're light bulbs.
- Are they really?

11:18.920 --> 11:23.080
- Where's your project?
- This is it.

11:23.080 --> 11:26.240
Annie Mack's sister brings me a...

11:26.240 --> 11:29.520
flashlight on wood?

11:29.520 --> 11:31.400
What depth.
What originality.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.120
You must have spent
minutes on this.

11:34.120 --> 11:36.360
How did you ever think of it?

11:36.360 --> 11:38.200
Did it come to you in a dream?

11:38.200 --> 11:40.440
Or did you steal it from a museum?

11:40.440 --> 11:43.080
Oh, and, and look!

11:43.080 --> 11:46.040
Class, it goes on, and off!

11:46.040 --> 11:48.240
[chuckles]

11:49.680 --> 11:52.520
It does more than that, Mr. Krantz.

11:54.040 --> 11:57.280
[electric popping and snapping]

11:57.280 --> 12:01.040
[class cheering]

12:07.560 --> 12:09.200
Whoa, check that out!

12:09.200 --> 12:12.680
- Which kid did that?
- A kid did that?

12:12.680 --> 12:14.040
[applause]

12:14.040 --> 12:21.000
Well, very interesting,
Miss Mack, and, uh, surprising.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.120
How, exactly,
did you make that happen?

12:24.720 --> 12:25.720
How?

12:28.760 --> 12:31.520
Well... how.

12:31.520 --> 12:34.040
Yes.
Well, it wasn't easy.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.120
Yes, I'm sure.

12:35.120 --> 12:39.600
Let me remind you that students
who don't do their own work--

12:39.600 --> 12:43.120
Say, by getting a sibling
to do it for them--

12:43.120 --> 12:45.000
Get an automatic F.

12:50.080 --> 12:50.880
Let's go.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.280
That's what's known in the
business as a clue worth pursuing.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.680
I just got to get this last piece.

12:56.680 --> 13:00.000
It'll be here
when you bet back.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.640
But I've almost got...
[yelling]

13:03.640 --> 13:05.600
Vince, I got it!
I got it!

13:05.600 --> 13:09.160
- [school bell rings]
- Vince, oh, Vince, Vince, Vince?

13:09.160 --> 13:14.640
I'll expect a detailed explanation
tomorrow in class, Miss Mack.

13:14.640 --> 13:19.000
I'll reserve the first
20 minutes just for you.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.640
Did you get the stuff?

13:35.040 --> 13:39.240
You are going to
owe me big for this.

13:39.240 --> 13:42.280
I know.
I mean, huge.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.920
- Like what?
- Like our room.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.840
- What about it?
- I want it--

13:48.840 --> 13:53.200
To myself, for a week.
But where will I sleep?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.800
Not in my room.
That's really not fair.

13:59.400 --> 14:02.680
But who said life is fair?

14:02.680 --> 14:05.680
Just help me get out of this mess.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.600
[sighs]

14:09.880 --> 14:13.000
You know, I wish I could
have seen Krantz's face

14:13.000 --> 14:15.040
when you shot off those fireworks.

14:15.040 --> 14:17.600
I bet his little bow tie
started to spin.

14:17.600 --> 14:20.080
It was pretty funny.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.880
It was still a stupid thing to do.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.840
And my first grade project--
How original.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.360
Ahh, don't you just love
the smell of bunsen burners?

14:42.360 --> 14:48.160
- They smell like knowledge.
- Yeah.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.040
Oh, boy, this takes me back.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.680
Back when I still thought

14:51.680 --> 14:54.440
electromagnetically induced
force fields

14:54.440 --> 14:57.240
had only a positive or
negative component.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.920
Was I ever that young?

14:58.920 --> 15:02.440
Maybe we should get started.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.840
Predictable.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.520
- It electrocutes insects.
- Hmm, I can see that.

15:14.520 --> 15:18.640
Of course, at this voltage
she's only confusing them.

15:18.640 --> 15:22.320
I hate to rush you, Annie
but we've got a lot of work to do.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.640
Wrong--
you have a lot of work to do.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.120
I'm just here to
guide and supervise.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.880
So guide me, supervise me.

15:29.880 --> 15:32.200
What do I fo first?

15:32.480 --> 15:34.560
First, you open the book,
and you read.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.120
Read?
I don't have time to...

15:38.720 --> 15:42.400
- Read.
- Right.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
- Lollipop?
- Dave?

15:52.600 --> 15:53.840
Yeah, Vince?

15:53.840 --> 15:57.240
Do you know what
our purpose is here?

15:57.240 --> 16:00.440
To make the grounds look tidy?

16:02.320 --> 16:03.480
[pops]

16:03.480 --> 16:06.080
No! We're here
looking for the kid

16:06.080 --> 16:08.760
you dumped the Chemical on,
remember?

16:08.760 --> 16:12.080
The custodian thing,
that's just make-believe.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.040
Your entire reason for living
is to help me find that kid.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.920
Otherwise,
you're totally useless to me.

16:18.920 --> 16:23.640
- [electric buzzing]
- No, try the other post.

16:23.640 --> 16:26.400
I know, I'm doing it.

16:27.800 --> 16:30.520
- [Vince whispering] Dave...
- Shh!

16:30.520 --> 16:33.920
...you're asking too many questions.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.240
[Dave]
Vince, is there something wrong?

16:39.240 --> 16:42.240
My neck hurts
and you're annoying me.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.960
Now, let's go.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.600
[whispering]: It's Vince and
the truck driver from the plant.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.360
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know.

16:54.360 --> 16:57.000
I'll get rid of them.
Stay and finish up.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.200
They found me.
I'm dead!

17:00.200 --> 17:03.720
- Forget about the science project.
- Alex, calm down.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.040
I'll be back, okay?
Just do your work.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
[Vince]
I'm sorry, Dave.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.

17:16.000 --> 17:19.240
- Did you guys just see that kid?
- What kid?

17:19.240 --> 17:22.160
Some kid, he just--
he just ran past here.

17:22.160 --> 17:24.079
He was acting really weird.

17:24.079 --> 17:26.839
His skin was changing colors
and he was shaking

17:26.839 --> 17:28.920
he didn't know what he was saying.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.800
He couldn't talk.
Probably something he ate.

17:31.800 --> 17:35.520
- [Vince] Which way did he go?
- That way.

17:51.800 --> 17:54.800
[electric popping and humming]

18:22.320 --> 18:25.680
I'm sure I saw him here somewhere.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.280
- Wait, there he is!
- [neck cracks] Oh!

18:31.280 --> 18:32.920
[groaning]

18:34.200 --> 18:38.000
[electric buzzing and snapping]

18:40.440 --> 18:43.520
[keys jangling]

19:16.040 --> 19:17.840
What the...?

19:17.840 --> 19:20.640
Mr. Krantz! Hi.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.880
[Krantz]
If it isn't Annie Mack!

19:22.880 --> 19:25.480
- [Vince] And who are you?
- I'm Mr. Krantz

19:25.480 --> 19:29.360
the head of the science department...
Ron.

19:29.360 --> 19:33.040
And somebody's in my room.
I need you to open this door.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.880
No problem.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.520
Probably some kid stuffed
chewing gum in the door jamb.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.600
As custodians,
we see a lot of this.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.280
On three.

19:44.680 --> 19:47.680
One... two...

19:47.680 --> 19:50.040
three! Whoa!

19:50.040 --> 19:52.360
- [buzzing]
- [groaning]

19:52.360 --> 19:53.200
Ah! Oh!

19:55.480 --> 19:58.120
Kids. If it's not milk
in the water fountain

19:58.120 --> 20:00.280
it's water on the classroom floor.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.480
- Be right back.
- [Alex] Ow!

20:02.480 --> 20:03.760
Ouch!

20:03.760 --> 20:07.320
That--
that looked like it really hurt.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.520
Very odd.
Mr. Krantz?

20:10.520 --> 20:12.840
Are you sure
someone was in here?

20:12.840 --> 20:16.280
I thought so, but, uh, maybe not.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.960
Now, this will only take a minute.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.880
Ow!

20:55.880 --> 20:57.440
Dave!

20:59.200 --> 21:02.000
What are you doing?
Ow!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.120
[splashing]

21:05.320 --> 21:07.720
There we go-- all tidy.

21:07.720 --> 21:12.160
- [sighing]
- [applause]

21:12.160 --> 21:14.200
No more questions?

21:14.200 --> 21:16.960
Well, here's one question
you didn't ask.

21:16.960 --> 21:19.640
The principle of current transference...

21:19.640 --> 21:22.680
Miss Mack, I think
you've explained it enough

21:22.680 --> 21:25.160
- to earn your A-plus.
- Excellent.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.440
It really was, Alex.

21:26.440 --> 21:29.080
This project brings back fond memories.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.960
I can see the Mack Torch

21:30.960 --> 21:33.440
has been passed
into very able hands.

21:33.440 --> 21:38.000
I'll obviously expect nothing less
from you in the future.

21:46.240 --> 21:50.080
No, Miss Atron.
We've turned up nothing here.

21:50.080 --> 21:53.880
Okay, on our way.

21:54.760 --> 21:58.000
We're going to Greenfields
Junior High next.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.880
My old school.
I went to Greenfields, too.

22:00.880 --> 22:04.240
Did you have Collins for shop?
I was kick out of shop.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.360
A difference of opinion
I'd rather not talk about.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.680
Greenfields, huh?
I don't remember you.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.960
There was this kid,
Vinny, though

22:12.960 --> 22:15.720
that was always getting beat up on.

22:16.480 --> 22:19.200
Must have been somebody else.

22:30.040 --> 22:31.200
Thanks.

22:31.200 --> 22:33.440
And I left my milk
on the coffee table.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.960
By the way, Alex, how did
your science project turn out?

22:36.960 --> 22:38.160
A-plus.

22:38.160 --> 22:40.640
Oh, not you, sweetie,
I was talking to Alex.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.480
Oh, right.
Alex got an A-plus.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.720
That's wonderful!
Congratulations--

22:44.720 --> 22:47.120
Uh, maybe we'll have a
third scientist in the family.

22:47.120 --> 22:52.040
Don't count on it, Dad.
[chuckling]

22:52.040 --> 22:55.240
Tell me again why
Alex is sleeping on the couch.

22:55.240 --> 22:59.120
- I'm not exactly sure.
- [Annie] Alex!

22:59.120 --> 23:01.840
Did you forget my glass of milk?

23:11.440 --> 23:17.520
- [Annie] Alex!
- Good night, Annie.

23:17.520 --> 23:18.600
[buzzing]
