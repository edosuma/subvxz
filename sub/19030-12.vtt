00:00.636 --> 00:02.541
<i>Now that Dr. Cox was
the Chief of Medicine,</i>

00:02.661 --> 00:04.541
<i>I had become the guy
everyone counted on</i>

00:04.661 --> 00:06.613
<i>to fight for the things
the hospital needed.</i>

00:06.733 --> 00:09.776
<i>Yep, I was the one person
who would get him to say...</i>

00:09.896 --> 00:10.586
No.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.674
You need to hire
a few more nurses.

00:12.794 --> 00:14.797
Look, Tammy.
We don't have the money.

00:14.917 --> 00:17.796
If you want to go out and raise
the cash yourself, feel free.

00:17.916 --> 00:20.366
Maybe you could sell
your eggs to a fertility clinic, or

00:20.486 --> 00:22.933
sell that beard of yours
to the Ridiculous Museum.

00:23.053 --> 00:26.220
Better yet, you could make a list
of all the people you drive insane

00:26.340 --> 00:30.364
and tell them that for a nominal fee,
you'll never speak to them again.

00:30.484 --> 00:32.859
You of course offer them
a monthly subscription

00:32.979 --> 00:34.972
at a reduced rate,
just to reel them in.

00:35.092 --> 00:38.252
And then after a while
of you not talking to them,

00:38.372 --> 00:40.604
people will forget just
how annoying you are

00:40.724 --> 00:43.084
and they'll let their
subscription run out.

00:43.204 --> 00:45.800
And, bang! That's when
you show up at their house,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.458
and you drive them
insane all over again,

00:48.578 --> 00:51.469
by speaking to them.
And here's the kicker.

00:51.589 --> 00:54.024
When everyone's trying
to re-subscribe,

00:54.144 --> 00:57.504
you lay it on them that
the price is now quadruple.

00:57.624 --> 01:01.108
And I'm predicting and
that's a low-end guesstimate,

01:01.386 --> 01:04.715
You're looking at about
$100,000,000 a quarter, easy.

01:04.834 --> 01:06.725
You give the hospital
a hundred thou,

01:06.845 --> 01:08.390
we hire a few nurses.

01:08.510 --> 01:10.240
But, until then,

01:10.531 --> 01:13.200
you go tell Carla
it ain't happening.

01:14.485 --> 01:16.451
- That was super fun.
- Get out!

01:16.571 --> 01:17.429
Nice seeing you.

01:17.549 --> 01:20.870
<i>Still, I knew Dr. Cox heard me.
Sometimes he came around.</i>

01:20.990 --> 01:23.257
Nice job, J.D.
We're wearing him down.

01:23.765 --> 01:25.003
<i>Plus, with my new role,</i>

01:25.123 --> 01:27.729
<i>people were treating me
with a new found respect.</i>

01:28.179 --> 01:29.544
I don't like how you're
trying to make people

01:29.664 --> 01:31.624
treat you with a new
found sense of respect.

01:31.744 --> 01:33.774
I'm not making people do anything.

01:33.894 --> 01:36.167
How else do you explain it?
Did you hypnotize them?

01:36.287 --> 01:38.559
Are you trying to hypnotize me?
'Cause that's not gonna work.

01:38.679 --> 01:40.198
I'm already hypnotized.

01:40.318 --> 01:43.437
15 years ago, I'm in Vegas,
I volunteer to be part of this guy's act.

01:43.557 --> 01:45.539
Half way through the show,
fire alarm goes off

01:45.659 --> 01:47.172
and I never get snapped out.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.877
There's some word
out there floating around

01:48.997 --> 01:51.241
like an on/off switch for me
that if I ever hear it,

01:51.361 --> 01:52.717
I'll just go completely unconscious.

01:52.837 --> 01:55.440
- Is it "sassafras"?
- It is "sassafras", you're right.

01:55.560 --> 01:57.526
It's amazing, of all the words
in the English language...

01:57.646 --> 01:59.225
Boondoggle.

01:59.345 --> 02:00.851
Yes! That was it?

02:00.971 --> 02:02.963
You're such an ass.
Here's your warning.

02:03.083 --> 02:05.066
If you start walking around here
like you're the big cheese,

02:05.186 --> 02:06.900
I'm gonna have to punish you.
Okay?

02:09.720 --> 02:10.976
"Pernicious".

02:11.652 --> 02:12.908
"Albatross".

02:13.829 --> 02:14.839
Nice try.

02:16.570 --> 02:19.011
Alright, guys. I'm gonna
introduce you to a new intern now,

02:19.131 --> 02:21.979
- This is Derek Hill.
- "Welcome to the team" five.

02:23.338 --> 02:25.321
Always use your non-cutting hand.

02:26.983 --> 02:28.015
Told you.

02:28.588 --> 02:30.708
Guys, if I could have a second to...

02:32.347 --> 02:33.871
"Quiet down" five.

02:36.868 --> 02:38.359
Thank you, Todd.

02:38.439 --> 02:39.785
You're all dismissed.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.694
Listen, if you need
anything, I'm here, okay?

02:45.814 --> 02:48.218
- I think I'll be fine.
- I like you.

02:49.250 --> 02:50.941
I am so mad at you.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.068
<i>He must have found out I tracked
down the testicle he had removed</i>

02:54.188 --> 02:56.200
<i>and turned it to
a tiny disco ball.</i>

02:56.320 --> 02:58.288
<i>Wait a second.
You dreamed that, you're fine.</i>

02:58.408 --> 03:00.512
Listen to me. You are
the man around here now

03:00.632 --> 03:03.158
You gotta get your strut on.
You know what I'm saying?

03:08.846 --> 03:10.239
Haven't you had this fantasy before?

03:10.359 --> 03:13.761
Yeah. Except I've been working out.
So this time, I get to be shirtless.

03:13.881 --> 03:15.775
- What's that?
- What's what?

03:15.895 --> 03:18.085
Did you make a disco ball
out of my testicle?

03:18.205 --> 03:20.722
Get out of the fantasy!
Get out of the fantasy!

03:20.842 --> 03:22.247
Hell no!

03:24.169 --> 03:25.496
<i>That was close.</i>

03:25.616 --> 03:27.247
Get your strut on!

03:31.104 --> 03:34.400
Behold King Cheese.
I warned you about this.

03:34.520 --> 03:37.056
And now, my liege, I'm afraid
it's time for your punishment.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.693
Let me just put down my popsicle.

03:39.733 --> 03:42.657
Fifteen years and
no one said "popsicle"?

03:43.231 --> 03:45.293
- Okay. Let's do this.
- Popsicle.

03:45.712 --> 03:46.853
Popsicle.

03:46.973 --> 03:49.328
- I had the craziest dream.
- Popsicle.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.099
I can believe he's buying this.

03:56.219 --> 03:57.859
It's gonna be a fun day.

Season 8 Episode 12
<i>Their Story II</i>

04:12.622 --> 04:16.242
And lastly, let's not forget
to get a patient's full history, okay?

04:16.362 --> 04:18.788
Especially medical allergies.

04:18.908 --> 04:20.004
You can go.

04:20.124 --> 04:22.036
<i>It's been so long
since I was an intern.</i>

04:22.157 --> 04:23.622
<i>I wonder what they're thinking.</i>

04:23.789 --> 04:25.682
<i>Notice me.
Notice me...</i>

04:29.904 --> 04:31.757
<i>'Cause I'm gonna hit that.</i>

04:32.598 --> 04:36.172
<i>Time to start yet another day
in the suckhole of all suckholes.</i>

04:36.292 --> 04:38.949
<i>I'm in such a good mood.
I think I'll do a little dance.</i>

04:40.369 --> 04:42.595
What did you think
of your first...

04:42.715 --> 04:45.003
John Dorian presentation
as it were?

04:45.352 --> 04:47.050
I imagine it's what people
felt like the first time

04:47.170 --> 04:48.935
they heard Dr. King speak.

04:49.187 --> 04:50.313
<i>What are you doing?</i>

04:50.433 --> 04:52.548
<i>That wise ass crap always
get you in trouble.</i>

04:52.668 --> 04:53.900
<i>Just keep your mouth shut.</i>

04:56.201 --> 04:58.446
For like a week now, I had
a really bad blurred vision

04:58.566 --> 04:59.674
and a stiff jaw.

04:59.895 --> 05:02.296
Sounds like my dad
after a couple martinis.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.609
Looks like you may
have a case of "WASPiness".

05:06.341 --> 05:09.064
<i>And you may have a touch
of the "self-laughies".</i>

05:09.913 --> 05:11.305
Okay. I'm back.

05:11.472 --> 05:14.022
Look, we are gonna
figure this out, I promise.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.064
Thanks.

05:16.211 --> 05:18.722
<i>Still, Dr. Reid
has been super-supportive.</i>

05:18.842 --> 05:20.840
<i>Toss her a compliment
as a thank you.</i>

05:21.075 --> 05:23.872
Even though that dress is
totally inappropriate for a doctor,

05:23.992 --> 05:25.959
- You're so rocking it.
- That's awesome

05:26.079 --> 05:28.060
because I actually have a policy
that if I don't get three compliments

05:28.180 --> 05:29.876
the first time I wear it,
I have to return it.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.210
Now, I've got you...

05:31.330 --> 05:34.465
J.D. he said this morning
that I looked "scrumpdelicious".

05:34.585 --> 05:36.758
Yeah, he actually
does talk like that.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.311
The meth addict from this morning
said he want to eat my eyeballs,

05:39.431 --> 05:42.561
which I'm counting because
the dress really make them pop.

05:42.928 --> 05:44.429
So, I've been thinking
about her a lot.

05:44.549 --> 05:46.336
And with the blurry vision
and the jaw thing,

05:46.456 --> 05:48.539
I bet Paige has
temporal arteritis.

05:48.659 --> 05:50.224
We should do a temporal
artery biopsy on her.

05:50.590 --> 05:53.102
Yeah, I'm not doing that. At her age,
it's probably neurological.

05:53.557 --> 05:54.458
<i>Crap.</i>

05:54.578 --> 05:55.652
Now,

05:55.772 --> 05:59.229
I just gotta remove the price tag,
because this little dressy is a keeper.

06:01.863 --> 06:02.862
Frick!

06:03.280 --> 06:04.280
<i>Good.</i>

06:05.518 --> 06:08.243
<i>Denise, Charlie, Derek, Elliot,</i>

06:08.363 --> 06:11.734
<i>Walter, John, Birdy,
Katie and Howie. 31.</i>

06:12.673 --> 06:15.213
I've made 31 new friends
since I started here.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.190
Hey, Howie, there's mints.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.560
Yes please.

06:20.729 --> 06:22.081
- Watch out!
- Move!

06:22.893 --> 06:25.843
- Move! Move! Move!
- Get out of the way!

06:26.310 --> 06:27.469
Relax people.

06:28.568 --> 06:30.056
Remote control.

06:30.863 --> 06:32.680
A patient once complained
that his room wasn't clean,

06:32.800 --> 06:34.978
so I stole the motor
from his wheelchair.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.397
- What are you guys doing?
- I'm using a mint.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.510
Those aren't mints. Those are highly
concentrated mini urinal cakes.

06:40.630 --> 06:41.751
Patent pending.

06:41.871 --> 06:42.819
They're good.

06:42.939 --> 06:45.082
Not a huge selling point
for urinal cakes, but thank you.

06:45.249 --> 06:48.079
Say, glasses. Who told you
you could touch my cart?

06:49.617 --> 06:50.936
<i>You can fix this.</i>

06:51.056 --> 06:52.500
Hi, I'm Sunny.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.414
Don't want to shake?

06:54.534 --> 06:57.497
That's okay. I'll just do a little
wave then. Hi, I'm Sonny.

06:57.992 --> 07:00.920
Come on. You can't stay angry in
such a beautiful day.

07:01.672 --> 07:02.829
Apology accepted.

07:02.949 --> 07:04.695
<i>And that's 32 new friends.</i>

07:04.862 --> 07:07.322
<i>Plus, he's not as weird as they say.</i>

07:08.017 --> 07:09.467
Cart, come.

07:15.064 --> 07:17.344
- Everything alright?
- Yeah, I'm good.

07:17.574 --> 07:21.253
<i>Crap, it's his Camp Counselor face.
Please don't try to make me open up.</i>

07:21.488 --> 07:24.913
Come on, Grumpy Bear. You see these
little things on the sides of my head?

07:25.080 --> 07:27.277
They're not just for
holding up my shades.

07:27.397 --> 07:28.277
Fine.

07:28.397 --> 07:30.188
I wanted to do a
temporal artery biopsy

07:30.308 --> 07:32.118
on a patient and
your girlfriend ignored me.

07:32.238 --> 07:33.595
Classic Elliot.

07:33.715 --> 07:35.557
She's totally
supportive and nurturing,

07:35.677 --> 07:37.675
but she'll never take
an intern's medical opinion.

07:37.795 --> 07:39.851
It's just not her way.
She's not proud of it.

07:40.256 --> 07:42.258
Just like I'm not
proud of the fact that

07:42.378 --> 07:46.047
just because I stand up to Dr. Cox,
oddly everyone thinks I'm so special.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.932
- You've heard about that right?
- I have.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.136
Sucks.

07:51.565 --> 07:53.422
- Hey, friend.
- Best friend.

07:53.806 --> 07:56.839
I'm so happy for him.
I'm so happy for him!

07:57.584 --> 07:59.981
You know what's annoying?
We all started out at the same time

08:00.101 --> 08:02.892
and now Dorian is
so far ahead of us, career-wise.

08:03.012 --> 08:04.493
That doesn't bother me.

08:04.613 --> 08:05.443
<i>Really?</i>

08:05.693 --> 08:07.578
This guy wants his spleen removed?

08:08.536 --> 08:09.994
I got his spleen now.

08:10.114 --> 08:11.324
Incoming!

08:12.100 --> 08:13.120
You know what?

08:13.240 --> 08:16.072
Why don't we take everything out?
How about that?

08:24.020 --> 08:25.245
I got a heart!

08:25.365 --> 08:26.733
I got his heart!

08:26.853 --> 08:30.476
I... got... his... heart!

08:32.293 --> 08:33.684
<i>It bothers him a little.</i>

08:35.890 --> 08:38.102
Hey, smiley intern.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

08:38.222 --> 08:39.222
Sure.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.101
- See you around.
- Wait.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.434
I thought you wanted to talk.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.786
No, I just wanted to punish
those two for touching my cart.

08:45.906 --> 08:47.860
So I rigged the elevator to
give them a little bit of a scare.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.536
It's all in good fun.

08:56.656 --> 08:58.262
Get me out of here!

08:58.615 --> 09:00.688
See and as long as
I wear my lab coat,

09:00.808 --> 09:02.376
you can't even see
the duct tape at all.

09:02.496 --> 09:04.412
The neck line is so cute.

09:04.532 --> 09:06.430
<i>This girly talk
is driving me insane.</i>

09:06.550 --> 09:10.108
And thanks so much. I love this
lip gloss, what flavor is it?

09:10.228 --> 09:11.995
Apri-gotchee-gotcha.

09:12.115 --> 09:14.613
Oh my go, we get it.
You have vaginas.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.461
On that note, I guess we'll go.

09:17.581 --> 09:19.782
A nurse is going to come by
and take some more blood work.

09:21.268 --> 09:23.168
Denise, if you'd studied
her case history,

09:23.288 --> 09:26.270
you'd know that Paige has
Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.752
She was born without a vagina.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.377
Oh my god. Are you serious?

09:30.497 --> 09:32.008
No, but if
you're gonna act weird

09:32.128 --> 09:34.056
around my patients,
I'm gonna have to torture you.

09:34.176 --> 09:36.360
I'm pissed right now,
but that was pretty awesome.

09:36.480 --> 09:37.483
Thank you.

09:37.603 --> 09:38.598
I'm just frustrated.

09:38.718 --> 09:41.223
I really think we should do
the biopsy, it can't do any harm.

09:41.343 --> 09:42.670
Oh please, not this again.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.554
If Paige really does
have temporal arteritis

09:44.674 --> 09:46.667
and we don't catch early,
she could go blind.

09:47.217 --> 09:49.484
I'm not good at mustering up
this whole over-the-top

09:49.604 --> 09:51.986
puppy dog sentiment thing
that you just eat up, but...

09:52.263 --> 09:55.406
What if I started telling people that
I wished you were my older sister?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.394
- Do you?
- No. Not really.

09:58.514 --> 09:59.920
I still take it.

10:14.521 --> 10:16.900
There he is.
You're ready to go?

10:17.020 --> 10:19.009
I just gotta go check
my messages at the front desk.

10:19.129 --> 10:21.712
I'd give up my cell phone number,
but it'd be ringing like crazy.

10:21.832 --> 10:23.890
Everybody wants a piece
of the big dog.

10:25.722 --> 10:27.300
I know what you're thinking.

10:27.420 --> 10:30.474
You're thinking J.D.
is a ridiculous arrogant tool.

10:30.594 --> 10:32.446
He didn't ask for this position.

10:32.566 --> 10:34.159
So cut him some slack, okay?

10:36.597 --> 10:38.512
- Did you guys see that?
- See what?

10:40.883 --> 10:42.009
Good cart.

10:44.168 --> 10:45.652
- Yeah?
- We did it.

10:45.772 --> 10:48.319
Dr. Cox is hiring more nurses.

10:48.439 --> 10:51.719
Forced overtime for the
nursing staff is now over.

10:51.839 --> 10:54.559
And it's all thanks
to this guy right here!

10:56.325 --> 10:58.090
Stop it everyone.

10:58.387 --> 11:00.629
Okay, keep it going
a little bit longer.

11:00.749 --> 11:03.374
And now you can stop it.
That was nice.

11:03.843 --> 11:05.662
<i>Come on, man.
Hold it together.</i>

11:06.625 --> 11:08.353
If we do hook up tonight,

11:08.473 --> 11:11.592
for once, you won't be
the only one thinking about J.D.

11:12.016 --> 11:13.208
<i>That did it.</i>

11:17.255 --> 11:19.388
- You're bigger than I remember.
- Thanks.

11:19.508 --> 11:20.690
I have to know.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.876
Why did you keep me
from getting on the elevator?

11:22.996 --> 11:24.569
I touched your cart too.

11:24.689 --> 11:27.601
It's simple. I don't mess with you
because I don't think you can take it.

11:28.162 --> 11:29.904
You're not strong enough.

11:38.145 --> 11:39.937
He said we were gonna die.

11:40.057 --> 11:41.442
We still might.

11:42.218 --> 11:44.512
<i>What does he mean,
I'm not strong enough?</i>

11:44.752 --> 11:47.305
<i>I hate this day!
This day stinks.</i>

11:47.728 --> 11:49.355
<i>This day rules.</i>

11:49.902 --> 11:52.254
Paige, I want to do
a temporal artery biopsy.

11:54.399 --> 11:58.038
<i>Just stay quiet. Don't get
sucked into their petty mess.</i>

11:58.158 --> 12:01.282
- Come on, buddy. Let's go get a beer.
- What? I thought we were going out.

12:01.696 --> 12:04.441
Because ever since you lucked into
the hospital do-gooder role,

12:04.561 --> 12:07.273
you've been acting like
a ridiculous arrogant tool.

12:07.393 --> 12:10.146
- No, I haven't.
- I'm not the only one who thinks it.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.072
<i>Please don't look at me.</i>

12:12.192 --> 12:14.458
<i>I'm invisible, I'm invisible!</i>

12:15.256 --> 12:16.149
<i>Perfect.</i>

12:19.979 --> 12:22.413
<i>Yesterday wasn't great.
But stick with the plan,</i>

12:22.533 --> 12:24.127
<i>and keep your mouth shut.</i>

12:25.327 --> 12:26.691
What are you being so pissy?

12:26.811 --> 12:29.671
Is that because Izzy pointed at the TV
at Al Roker and called him "daddy"?

12:29.791 --> 12:31.424
I don't want to talk about it, baby.

12:31.544 --> 12:34.537
<i>You do not want to get
mixed up in a lover's quarrel.</i>

12:34.657 --> 12:36.726
So how was your night with Turk?

12:37.570 --> 12:39.105
You know what?
I don't want to hear it.

12:41.056 --> 12:42.502
I can't believe
you hooked up with Howie.

12:42.622 --> 12:45.892
I just gave him the sideboob.
I give anybody the sideboob.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.454
You want some sideboob?

12:47.842 --> 12:49.295
I'm in a good mood.

12:51.937 --> 12:54.231
My results are in from the biopsy.
Watch my food.

12:58.645 --> 12:59.695
The hell are you doing?

13:00.099 --> 13:02.995
He won't do anything to me.
He thinks I'm too weak.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.086
You shouldn't throw produce,
it's very dangerous.

13:05.206 --> 13:07.726
I had a cousin that was
killed by a head of lettuce.

13:07.846 --> 13:10.288
It's a true story. Well, actually
not the head of lettuce so much

13:10.408 --> 13:12.625
as the pack of sewer
rabbits that he stole it from.

13:12.875 --> 13:13.838
Sewer rabbit!

13:15.221 --> 13:18.051
I'd be impressed, young lady,
but I can do the same thing.

13:18.218 --> 13:19.027
Observe.

13:26.593 --> 13:27.431
Popsicle.

13:31.865 --> 13:32.978
Popsicle.

13:36.823 --> 13:40.387
As it turned out, the janitor lied
to me about being hypnotized.

13:41.938 --> 13:43.738
<i>Paige's biopsy is negative.</i>

13:43.858 --> 13:44.965
<i>Great.</i>

13:45.085 --> 13:46.851
<i>You know what's gonna happen next.</i>

13:47.201 --> 13:48.672
I told you so!

13:52.766 --> 13:54.375
And now in French.

13:54.495 --> 13:57.446
<i>Je te l'ai dit.
Oui c'est ça, je te l'ai dit.</i>

13:57.566 --> 13:58.966
You want some German,
Denise, huh?

13:59.086 --> 14:02.612
<i>Ich hab's gesagt, ja das
stimmt, ich hab's gesagt.</i>

14:02.732 --> 14:05.111
I told you so.

14:08.092 --> 14:09.601
<i>Maybe she won't rub it in my face.</i>

14:10.233 --> 14:11.843
I told you so!

14:18.147 --> 14:19.428
I'm not gonna do the splits here.

14:19.548 --> 14:21.349
This floor's disgusting
and I'm wearing a thong,

14:21.469 --> 14:23.476
But I can bring it home
with a little robot for you.

14:23.596 --> 14:24.613
Robot.

14:25.036 --> 14:27.091
Told... you... so.

14:28.356 --> 14:29.818
Fine. You were right.

14:29.938 --> 14:31.996
But at least we know now.
No harm done.

14:36.108 --> 14:38.922
I have to have this scar
on my face for nothing.

14:39.981 --> 14:43.524
I know that it seems big now,
but it will get smaller as it heals.

14:45.859 --> 14:47.394
Paige, what are you doing?

14:47.514 --> 14:49.772
I know it's silly, but I just...

14:51.760 --> 14:53.216
I like my eyes.

14:55.504 --> 14:56.906
It's not fair.

14:59.571 --> 15:01.400
Can I just have a minute, please?

15:01.866 --> 15:02.901
Of course.

15:05.459 --> 15:06.459
Crap.

15:08.060 --> 15:09.813
Please do not do the robot again.

15:10.533 --> 15:11.327
Fine.

15:11.964 --> 15:13.891
This is why I don't listen
to interns, okay?

15:14.011 --> 15:16.922
It's not because you're young
or because I'm stubborn.

15:17.089 --> 15:18.934
It's because you're not accountable.

15:19.101 --> 15:20.803
If there's a mistake
or a misdiagnosis,

15:20.923 --> 15:23.455
or even a tiny little scar
on someone's face,

15:23.575 --> 15:24.667
it's on me.

15:24.787 --> 15:26.315
And that's how it should be.

15:26.435 --> 15:29.385
Interns need a little safety
net at first just to survive.

15:30.237 --> 15:32.890
So don't feel guilty
about her, okay?

15:33.010 --> 15:35.935
It was my decision.
I'm the one who has to feel guilty.

15:39.975 --> 15:41.886
I can't believe you did this to me.

15:42.515 --> 15:45.141
<i>Oh my god. Is anyone
in more hell than I am?</i>

15:48.566 --> 15:50.118
It's Derek, right?

15:50.628 --> 15:53.041
<i>Last time you talked to this guy,
you compared him to M.L. King,</i>

15:53.161 --> 15:54.898
<i>so he hates you.
Unless...</i>

15:55.018 --> 15:57.786
<i>his ego is so big
he thought you were serious.</i>

15:57.906 --> 15:59.501
Derek, I too have a dream.

16:00.821 --> 16:04.668
That one day, Turk will
be able to deal with my...

16:04.885 --> 16:08.616
Well, let's just call it what it is,
meteoric rise to prominence.

16:08.736 --> 16:11.308
It's hard for him, because
he's used to being the big shot.

16:11.428 --> 16:13.227
Oh my god.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.588
Is that why Turk is being such a pain?
He can be the biggest baby.

16:17.430 --> 16:19.488
I'm Carla.
You're handsome.

16:19.816 --> 16:22.612
Be careful, she likes
brown men. We both do.

16:22.935 --> 16:23.921
<i>Kill me.</i>

16:24.854 --> 16:26.490
What are you doing
sitting with them?

16:26.610 --> 16:27.991
<i>And now it's worse.</i>

16:28.111 --> 16:30.234
Hi. Eavesdropping.

16:30.354 --> 16:32.193
Now, I'm not exactly clear
on the details,

16:32.313 --> 16:33.785
but, from what I can gather,

16:33.905 --> 16:36.670
my new promotion and
subsequent interaction with you

16:36.790 --> 16:40.357
seems to have caused
a rift in your relationship.

16:40.988 --> 16:42.840
Well quite frankly,
I think it's fantastic.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.250
You're being an idiot.

16:44.370 --> 16:46.400
And the wife is
upset too. Hot diggity.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.071
You could try and empathize

16:48.191 --> 16:50.579
instead of giving Derek
over here the googly eyes.

16:52.198 --> 16:53.517
- Carla.
- What?

16:53.637 --> 16:56.466
Give her a break, man!
He's like a male Halle Berry.

16:56.586 --> 16:58.838
So what do you say, new guy?
What do you make of all this?

16:58.958 --> 17:01.252
<i>God I want to answer that.</i>

17:01.372 --> 17:03.284
<i>But don't. Don't.</i>

17:03.404 --> 17:04.800
Scintillating. Get out!

17:07.566 --> 17:08.984
<i>Free at last!</i>

17:09.563 --> 17:11.593
<i>It still feels a
little crappy though.</i>

17:11.713 --> 17:14.401
<i>You always prided yourself
on saying what you think.</i>

17:14.784 --> 17:16.973
<i>But it's about the job, right?</i>

17:17.141 --> 17:19.315
<i>Who is the janitor to judge me?</i>

17:19.435 --> 17:20.896
<i>He doesn't know me.</i>

17:21.016 --> 17:22.974
<i>Maybe I should just be happy
I'm the one person here</i>

17:23.095 --> 17:24.690
<i>he isn't going to hassle.</i>

17:24.810 --> 17:26.800
<i>I never asked Elliot
to take the blame.</i>

17:26.921 --> 17:28.859
<i>Still, I'm glad
I didn't have to talk to Paige.</i>

17:28.979 --> 17:30.606
<i>That would have sucked.</i>

17:31.006 --> 17:32.142
<i>The hell with it.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:36.263
Hey, jackasses!

17:38.372 --> 17:40.067
Hey, Mopingstein!

17:41.682 --> 17:42.811
Hey, Paige.

17:44.724 --> 17:46.068
I just wanted you
to know that

17:46.188 --> 17:48.655
even though Dr. Reid
took the blame,

17:49.557 --> 17:51.931
I was the one that really
pushed for that biopsy.

17:52.235 --> 17:54.475
I was just trying
to look out for you.

17:55.339 --> 17:56.339
Anyway...

17:57.538 --> 17:58.827
I'm really sorry.

17:59.808 --> 18:00.788
Thank you.

18:07.811 --> 18:09.025
Listen, you know...

18:11.706 --> 18:12.706
Little lemonade.

18:15.699 --> 18:16.820
Too sweet.

18:19.881 --> 18:20.891
Hey, you were saying?

18:21.509 --> 18:25.064
You know how hard it is to
walk around this hospital like this

18:25.979 --> 18:29.605
when sometimes inside
I feel like this?

18:30.146 --> 18:31.944
- It didn't change.
- It did a little.

18:33.275 --> 18:34.400
Bottom line,

18:35.675 --> 18:37.259
I am a strong person.

18:38.017 --> 18:39.850
I know, I sized you up right away.

18:40.151 --> 18:41.959
Then why don't you get me back?

18:42.079 --> 18:44.016
Have you been obsessing about this?

18:44.136 --> 18:45.583
Maybe unable to sleep?

18:45.703 --> 18:48.826
All you can think about is the fact
that I think you're a weak person?

18:48.946 --> 18:49.639
Yeah.

18:50.516 --> 18:51.699
Consider yourself gotten.

18:59.017 --> 19:00.626
Much better. Thank you.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.349
It's learning.

19:04.312 --> 19:05.667
You guys really
want to know what I think?

19:05.787 --> 19:08.321
Let me start with you,
Martin Luther King?

19:08.441 --> 19:10.816
He changed the nation.
Dial it down a notch.

19:11.656 --> 19:14.181
And you!
Way to have your husband's back.

19:14.534 --> 19:16.287
Way to represent for your man.

19:16.407 --> 19:18.467
The guy is obviously
going through something.

19:18.587 --> 19:22.097
And what type of sick,
twisted, insecure person

19:22.217 --> 19:25.430
do you have to be to get your
jollies off other people's misery?

19:26.019 --> 19:27.585
And finally, my man.

19:28.025 --> 19:30.582
You know how excited I was
when I found out that my new boss

19:30.702 --> 19:32.029
was a black surgeon?

19:32.423 --> 19:33.760
Finally a role model.

19:33.880 --> 19:34.671
Right?

19:34.934 --> 19:35.545
Wrong,

19:35.665 --> 19:38.055
because I don't want to become
a giant bald seven year old

19:38.175 --> 19:39.943
who's obsessed with his best friend.

19:40.171 --> 19:41.583
So thanks everyone.

19:41.703 --> 19:43.875
You guys have made
these first few days

19:44.299 --> 19:45.514
very special.

19:46.498 --> 19:49.702
<i>As we all sat there gathering the
nerve to apologize to each other...</i>

19:52.030 --> 19:53.164
<i>Well most of us...</i>

19:53.856 --> 19:56.116
<i>I couldn't help but
remember my own internship,</i>

19:56.236 --> 19:59.726
<i>and all the different things you had
to do to be accepted here as a doctor.</i>

20:00.269 --> 20:02.654
- <i>You have to be accountable.</i>
- Let me diagnose the next one.

20:02.774 --> 20:04.535
If I'm wrong,
I'll just apologize again.

20:04.655 --> 20:05.918
God you're so annoying.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.462
- I am Dr. Reid.
- And I'm Dr. Mahoney and I'm sorry.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.068
Just getting it out of the way.

20:12.261 --> 20:13.483
<i>You have to prove your strength.</i>

20:13.650 --> 20:14.834
Hey, giggle face.

20:17.024 --> 20:18.407
Still owed you for the tomatoes.

20:18.527 --> 20:19.527
Thank you.

20:22.002 --> 20:25.318
<i>But in the end, all you can do is
be yourself and hope it works out.</i>

20:26.967 --> 20:28.330
It's good, buddy.

20:30.093 --> 20:31.228
New guy.

20:32.401 --> 20:33.482
Hey, Derek.

20:39.730 --> 20:41.311
Good cart.

20:41.742 --> 20:44.411
Good cart.
Who is a good cart?

20:48.076 --> 20:49.168
Fetch.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.832
Good boy.

20:53.415 --> 20:54.645
Who's a good boy?

20:55.082 --> 20:56.131
It sucks.

20:56.519 --> 20:59.174
Having everyone here look up to you.

21:00.270 --> 21:02.670
- I don't think everyone.
- Of course not everyone.

21:04.498 --> 21:08.077
Is there someone in particular
who is not looking to me? 'Cause...

21:08.973 --> 21:10.009
