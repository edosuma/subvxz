Good people of Atlanta,

01:04.731 --> 01:06.733
we must never forget...

01:07.734 --> 01:09.611
that Anthony Bourdain...

01:10.320 --> 01:11.154
Yeah!

01:11.237 --> 01:12.906
...killed himself.

01:16.785 --> 01:20.288
Anthony Bourdain had the greatest job
that show business ever produced.

01:20.371 --> 01:23.583
This nigga flew around the world...

01:25.210 --> 01:29.631
...and ate delicious meals
with outstanding people.

01:30.131 --> 01:33.218
That man with that job

01:33.593 --> 01:36.596
hung himself in a luxury suite in France.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.493
I knew a nigga in high school
that was an urban genius.

01:58.827 --> 02:00.870
This motherfucker's grades was so good,

02:00.954 --> 02:04.165
he got all the way from the hood
to an Ivy League school

02:04.249 --> 02:06.459
with a full scholarship.

02:07.085 --> 02:09.170
From there, the motherfucker got himself

02:09.254 --> 02:11.631
into one of the best law schools
in the country.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.466
And when he was in law school,

02:13.842 --> 02:16.636
he met a woman and they fell in love.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.763
And they were gonna get married.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.224
I remember him telling me about it.
He was home for Christmas,

02:21.307 --> 02:23.977
and I told him, I said, "My man, my man...

02:24.644 --> 02:27.438
save that bitch for late in your life."

02:36.239 --> 02:37.574
But he's in love.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.367
He didn't listen to me.

02:39.450 --> 02:42.412
He married her while he was in law school,

02:42.495 --> 02:45.248
and sadly, they got divorced,

02:45.331 --> 02:47.125
while he was in law school.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.587
He was a street nigga from the hood.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.380
This man had nothing...

02:53.047 --> 02:55.091
and that bitch took half of that.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.306
And then, I just never saw him again
for years,

03:01.389 --> 03:04.601
and then, two years ago,
I was home in DC doing some shoppin',

03:04.684 --> 03:07.270
tryin' to buy my sons some socks
at Foot Locker.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.106
I go to Foot Locker.
Guess who's the manager?

03:10.648 --> 03:11.608
That nigga.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.486
Dressed like a referee, the whole shit.

03:17.238 --> 03:20.450
This motherfucker is 45 years old!

03:22.619 --> 03:26.122
We went out drinking that night
just tryin' to catch up, and...

03:26.206 --> 03:27.165
and he told me.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.876
He said he's been living
with his mother for, like, ten years,

03:29.959 --> 03:31.711
just trying to get back on his feet.

03:31.794 --> 03:35.173
But that's not the point of the story.
The point of the story is...

03:35.882 --> 03:38.176
never occurred to this nigga
to kill himself.

03:40.428 --> 03:42.513
He's alive and well in D.C.

03:50.438 --> 03:52.857
I even suggested to him
that he should try it out.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.776
Like, "I don't know, maybe..."

04:02.200 --> 04:03.660
Nobody's life is perfect.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.870
No matter what it looks like
from the outside,

04:05.954 --> 04:08.373
you don't know what the fuck's
going on inside.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.874
I have a great life,

04:09.958 --> 04:12.418
but it's not a perfect life,
but it's good. It's...

04:12.502 --> 04:15.630
My shit's like an above ground pool.
You ever seen one of them?

04:19.717 --> 04:21.302
It's a pool.

04:29.143 --> 04:32.480
So, in that spirit, tonight I thought
I'd start my show a little differently.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.731
Tonight I'm gonna do something

04:33.815 --> 04:36.651
that I'm not particularly good at
but that I like to do.

04:36.734 --> 04:38.861
Tonight I'm gonna try
some impressions out.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.454
I only got two.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.959
Aight, the first impression's
kind of dumb, but I like it.

04:53.042 --> 04:54.919
This... This is my impression, you ready?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.379
This is my impression...

04:57.005 --> 04:59.590
of the Founding Fathers of America...

05:01.009 --> 05:03.261
when the Constitution was being written.

05:03.970 --> 05:04.804
You ready?

05:05.388 --> 05:06.264
Here it goes.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.476
Hurry up and finish
that Constitution, nigger.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.020
I'm trying to get some sleep.

05:17.817 --> 05:18.985
It's not bad, right?

05:22.864 --> 05:24.407
All right, the next one...

05:30.455 --> 05:32.040
The next one's a little harder.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.877
I want to see if you can guess who it is
I'm doing an impression of.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.755
All right? Let me get into character.
You gotta guess who it is, though.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.590
Okay, here it goes.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.008
Uh, duh.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.468
Hey! Durr!

05:43.551 --> 05:47.513
If you do anything wrong in your life,
duh, and I find out about it,

05:47.597 --> 05:49.766
I'm gonna try to take everything
away from you,

05:49.849 --> 05:51.184
and I don't care when I find out.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.145
Could be today, tomorrow,
15, 20 years from now.

05:54.228 --> 05:57.440
If I find out,
you're fucking-duh-finished.

05:58.441 --> 05:59.859
- Trump.
-Who... Who's that?

05:59.942 --> 06:00.985
- Trump
- Trump.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.820
That's you!

06:05.615 --> 06:08.034
That's what the audience
sounds like to me.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.166
That's why I don't be coming out
doing comedy all the time,

06:15.249 --> 06:17.502
'cause y'all niggas
is the worst motherfuckers

06:17.585 --> 06:19.087
I've ever tried to entertain

06:19.170 --> 06:21.798
in my fucking life.

06:24.759 --> 06:25.593
Ugh.

06:27.470 --> 06:28.513
I'm goddamn sick of it.

06:28.596 --> 06:30.598
This is the worst time ever
to be a celebrity.

06:30.681 --> 06:32.892
You're gonna be finished.
Everyone's doomed.

06:34.143 --> 06:37.021
Michael Jackson has been dead
for ten years

06:37.105 --> 06:39.774
and this nigga has two new cases.

06:46.781 --> 06:49.117
And if you haven't watched
that documentary...

06:49.367 --> 06:51.035
uh, then I'm begging you,

06:51.619 --> 06:52.578
don't watch it.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.581
It's fucking gross.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.294
I felt like HBO was sticking
baby dicks in my ears

07:00.378 --> 07:01.838
for four hours straight.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.049
Really nasty shit.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.760
I don't want to know all these things.

07:10.263 --> 07:15.852
Turns out, uh, Michael Jackson allegedly
likes a long gander at the anus.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.649
They said he stares at people's buttholes.
That's what they said.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.860
That's how gross the documentary was.

07:34.203 --> 07:36.831
I'm gonna say something
that I'm not allowed to say.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.501
But I gotta be real. Uh...

07:41.461 --> 07:43.379
I don't believe these motherfuckers.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.592
I do not believe them.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.595
But...

07:51.471 --> 07:53.347
let me qualify the statement.

07:53.431 --> 07:57.560
I... I am what's known on the streets
as a victim blamer.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.940
You know what I mean? If somebody
come up to me like, "Dave, Dave,

08:03.024 --> 08:04.567
Chris Brown just beat up Rihanna."

08:04.901 --> 08:06.777
I'll be like, "Well, what did she do?"

08:13.659 --> 08:16.621
"Dave, Michael Jackson
was molesting children."

08:16.704 --> 08:19.332
"Well, what were those kids
wearing at the time?"

08:26.839 --> 08:28.049
I don't think he did it.

08:29.258 --> 08:31.886
But you know what? Even if he did do it...

08:33.387 --> 08:34.514
You know what I mean?

08:39.268 --> 08:40.728
You know what I mean?

08:41.604 --> 08:42.522
Eh...

08:43.064 --> 08:44.774
I mean, it's Michael Jackson.

08:47.693 --> 08:50.071
I know more than half the people
in this room

08:50.154 --> 08:52.323
have been molested in their lives.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.494
But it wasn't no goddamn Michael Jackson,
was it?

09:00.289 --> 09:02.875
This kid got his dick sucked
by the King of Pop.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.798
All we get is awkward Thanksgivings
for the rest of our lives.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.975
You know how good it must've felt to go
to school the next day after that shit?

09:19.517 --> 09:20.851
"Hey, Billy, how was the weekend?"

09:20.935 --> 09:22.395
"How was my weekend?

09:24.021 --> 09:26.816
Michael Jackson sucked my dick!

09:30.319 --> 09:32.405
And that was my first sexual experience.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.992
If I'm starting here,
then sky's the limit!"

09:45.835 --> 09:49.338
I know it seems harsh, but, man,
somebody's gotta teach these kids.

09:50.298 --> 09:52.633
There's no such thing
as a free trip to Hawaii.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.556
He's gonna want to look
at your butthole or something.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.693
You know why I don't believe it?
You know why I don't believe it?

10:10.776 --> 10:13.404
Because if Michael Jackson's out here
doing all this molesting,

10:13.487 --> 10:16.407
then-- then why not Macaulay Culkin? Hmm?

10:17.408 --> 10:19.160
Macaulay Culkin stated in an interview

10:19.243 --> 10:22.830
that Michael Jackson
never did anything inappropriate with him

10:22.913 --> 10:24.457
or even around him.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.167
Think about that shit.

10:28.085 --> 10:29.003
You know...

10:30.212 --> 10:31.380
I'm not a pedophile.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.844
But if I was...

10:40.222 --> 10:43.893
Macaulay Culkin's the first kid
I'm fucking, I'll tell you that right now.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.858
I'd be a goddamn hero.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.319
"Hey, that guy over there
fucked the kid from <i>Home Alone.</i>

10:53.402 --> 10:56.072
And you know how hard he is to catch."

11:06.832 --> 11:09.251
<i>♪ My mind's telling me, "No"</i> ♪

11:09.335 --> 11:11.462
- Oh!

11:14.757 --> 11:16.050
R. Kelly!

11:16.133 --> 11:18.969
Well, okay. R. Kelly is different.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.265
I mean, you know, if I'm a bettin' man,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.726
I'm gonna put my money on
"He probably did that shit."

11:27.645 --> 11:31.440
I'm pretty sure he did that shit.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.277
You know, it was bad,
okay, so a couple years ago,

11:35.361 --> 11:37.113
I was doing a show in Detroit.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.073
And I'm sitting backstage
in my dressing room

11:39.156 --> 11:41.575
and a friend of mine comes by,
this chick, Dream Hampton.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.787
Dream, uh, tells me,
right before I'm going on stage,

11:44.870 --> 11:48.708
she goes, "Dave, I'm working
on a documentary about R. Kelly.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
"Would you like to be in it?"

11:50.209 --> 11:52.169
And I was like, "Nah, bitch, I'm cool."

11:58.384 --> 12:00.428
I went onstage,
I just forgot about the shit,

12:00.511 --> 12:01.762
and then two years later,

12:01.846 --> 12:04.390
the documentary comes out,
<i>Surviving R. Kelly.</i>

12:04.473 --> 12:05.599
And when it comes out,

12:06.183 --> 12:08.728
Dream's promotin' shit
and she keeps bringing me up.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.856
She said, "I asked Dave Chappelle
to be in my documentary,

12:12.314 --> 12:15.401
and he said it was too hot for TV."

12:15.735 --> 12:17.695
Bitch, I did not say that.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.866
That does not even sound like how I talk.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.910
"Oh, that's too hot for TV."
I would never say that shit.

12:32.376 --> 12:35.921
But I'm gonna tell you guys
why I wasn't in the documentary.

12:36.213 --> 12:37.548
It's a very simple reason,

12:37.631 --> 12:41.594
and, uh, I cannot stress
this point enough.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.346
The only reason that I didn't do it

12:44.430 --> 12:46.557
was because, and this is very important...

12:48.517 --> 12:52.855
I don't know this nigga at all!

12:56.317 --> 12:57.193
I don't know anything!

12:57.276 --> 12:59.487
I don't know anything
that they don't tell me about.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.864
I don't hang out with this nigga.
Nothing.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.576
So what the fuck do I got to be
in the documentary for?

13:09.246 --> 13:11.665
This guy, R. Kelly,
got another sex tape out now.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.294
Can you believe that shit?
This guy makes more sex tapes

13:15.377 --> 13:16.504
than he does music.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.216
He's like the DJ Khaled of sex tapes.

13:20.883 --> 13:21.967
"Another one."

13:22.051 --> 13:23.427
Like, damn, nigga!

13:26.305 --> 13:27.598
That's a lot of tapes.

13:30.434 --> 13:32.937
The new one's so bad
that they didn't even show it.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.523
I've never seen anything like this.

13:35.606 --> 13:39.527
The prosecutor in Chicago
came out in a press conference

13:39.610 --> 13:43.989
and read to the media
a transcript of a sex tape.

13:44.073 --> 13:48.244
Have you ever heard of such a thing?
This nigga <i>read </i>the sex tape.

13:49.078 --> 13:54.959
And it was so bad that R. Kelly
sounded guilty in the transcripts.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.962
It's fucking amazing.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.590
Sixteen times
the girl's age was mentioned.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.633
Isn't that crazy?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.844
This motherfucker is an idiot.
He was fuckin' her like,

14:04.927 --> 14:08.848
"Yeah, this is the best 14-year-old pussy
I've ever had in my life."

14:08.931 --> 14:10.766
She was like,
"You like this 14-year-old pussy?"

14:10.850 --> 14:14.687
Like, "Oh, yeah, I love this." I'm like,
"Man, you need to shut the fuck up."

14:16.021 --> 14:18.482
You gotta give your lawyer
something to work with.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.570
You supposed to be on the tape like,
"This is the best...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.739
36-year-old pussy
I've ever had in my life."

14:27.658 --> 14:28.784
Then your lawyer can be like,

14:28.868 --> 14:31.954
"Your Honor, clearly my client
thought that this woman was 36,

14:32.162 --> 14:34.790
as he mentioned some 16 times
in the tape."

14:38.043 --> 14:41.755
They gonna know you lying, though,
you know what I mean. Everybody knows...

14:42.047 --> 14:44.592
no such thing as good 36-year-old pussy.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.400
Doesn't matter what I say.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.694
And if you at home
watching this shit on Netflix,

15:03.777 --> 15:06.196
remember, bitch, you clicked on my face.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.880
Celebrity hunting season.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.925
Doesn't matter what I say, they're going
to get everybody eventually.

15:26.008 --> 15:28.677
Like, look, I don't think
I did anything wrong, but...

15:29.219 --> 15:30.137
but we'll see.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.227
They even got poor Kevin Hart.

15:37.978 --> 15:40.981
Can you imagine such a thing?
Kevin Hart, let me tell you something.

15:41.065 --> 15:45.778
It was... It was Kevin Hart's dream
to host the Oscars.

15:46.403 --> 15:47.571
That's what he told me.

15:48.072 --> 15:51.033
And I remember when he told me,
'cause I was thinking to myself,

15:51.116 --> 15:54.286
"Well, that's an awfully strange dream
for an African American."

15:57.915 --> 16:00.376
What kind of nigga dreams
of hosting the Oscars?

16:01.752 --> 16:03.128
Kevin did, that's who.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.755
And he did it.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.384
Against all the odds, Kevin became
the most famous comedian

16:08.467 --> 16:10.135
this world has ever seen,

16:10.219 --> 16:13.347
and he got the job that only one black man
before him had had.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.058
He was gonna host the 80th Oscars.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.768
And I don't know what you know
about Kevin,

16:17.851 --> 16:21.230
but I know
Kevin Hart is damn near perfect.

16:21.313 --> 16:24.316
As close to perfect
as anybody I've ever seen.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.401
In fact,

16:25.693 --> 16:31.323
Kevin is precisely four tweets shy
of being perfect.

16:36.036 --> 16:37.162
Ten years ago,

16:37.246 --> 16:40.791
Kevin had made
some very homophobic comments.

16:41.166 --> 16:43.877
And I'm not gonna repeat what he said...

16:45.295 --> 16:46.505
because this is Atlanta.

16:55.222 --> 16:56.807
You know what I mean.

16:57.933 --> 17:01.186
I'm sure there's a lot of gay men
here tonight...

17:01.520 --> 17:02.646
with their wives.

17:14.241 --> 17:16.618
Far be it from me to offend anybody.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.706
All right, I'll tell you what he said.

17:22.458 --> 17:24.960
But just remember, these are not my words.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.920
These were Kevin's words.

17:27.504 --> 17:28.922
And it was a long time ago.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.676
And I'm paraphrasing, 'cause I'm not good
at telling other people's jokes.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.470
Okay, Kevin said...

17:37.681 --> 17:41.560
that if his little son was demonstrating
or-or-or exhibiting,

17:41.643 --> 17:44.938
uh, homosexual behavior around the house,
that he'd chastise him.

17:45.022 --> 17:46.440
He'd say, "Hey, that's gay."

17:46.523 --> 17:49.359
And then he said
he would smash a dollhouse

17:49.443 --> 17:50.986
over that child's head.

17:53.113 --> 17:55.824
Ooh, the gay community was furious.

17:56.700 --> 17:57.826
And I don't blame 'em.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.704
I got a lot of gay friends.

18:01.872 --> 18:03.165
And all of them, 100% of them,

18:03.248 --> 18:07.211
all have told me fuckin' horror stories
about the shit they had to go through

18:07.294 --> 18:08.504
just to be themselves.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.214
Crazy, crazy stories.

18:10.297 --> 18:12.049
And in all those stories, I gotta say,

18:12.132 --> 18:14.635
not one of them
has ever mentioned anything like...

18:15.427 --> 18:21.475
their father smashing a fucking dollhouse
over their head.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.145
'Cause, clearly, Kevin was joking.

18:25.646 --> 18:28.273
Think about it. You would have to buy
this nigga a dollhouse

18:28.357 --> 18:30.109
to break it over his head
in the first place.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.820
Does that sound right?
Is anybody gonna do that?

18:37.324 --> 18:40.369
The gay community was upset,
and then they put so much pressure

18:40.452 --> 18:42.412
on the Academy
of Motion Pictures and Sciences

18:42.496 --> 18:46.375
that they went to Kevin and said,
"If you don't apologize to that community,

18:46.458 --> 18:48.585
then you cannot host these Oscars."

18:48.669 --> 18:51.964
And then Kevin said, "Fuck it, I quit."

19:00.389 --> 19:04.143
And then he went on every talk show
in America and apologized for six weeks.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.484
Kevin fucked up.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.737
I understand the mistake he made

19:15.821 --> 19:18.031
because I've made the same mistake
early in my career.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.825
This is many years ago, 15 years ago.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.077
It was when I was doing <i>Chappelle's Show.</i>
There's a--

19:22.161 --> 19:23.537
Thank you. Thank you.

19:29.960 --> 19:30.878
On network television,

19:30.961 --> 19:34.298
they have a department
that's called Standards and Practices.

19:34.506 --> 19:39.011
This is the department that tells you
what you can and cannot say on television.

19:39.094 --> 19:42.181
And if you're doing your job well,
you should never hear from 'em.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.891
But if you're making <i>Chappelle's Show,</i>

19:43.974 --> 19:47.561
you'll hear from these motherfuckers
all the time.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.274
And remember, this was 15 years ago.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.985
I made a mistake. I didn't even know
I'd done anything wrong.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.112
I had written a sketch...

19:57.738 --> 19:59.323
that had the word...

20:01.033 --> 20:02.242
"faggot "in it.

20:11.793 --> 20:14.463
So I had to go to Standards and Practices.
They call me up.

20:14.546 --> 20:17.674
I don't know why they're calling me, but
I like the lady that runs the department.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.134
She's usually really fair

20:19.218 --> 20:21.511
and was one of my favorite people
I've ever worked with.

20:21.595 --> 20:23.972
So she sits me down.
We have a nice conversation.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.849
She tells me,
"Oh, the sketches are great."

20:25.933 --> 20:28.435
I go, "Oh, fantastic.
Well, then... well, then, why am I here?"

20:28.894 --> 20:30.479
She said, "Because, David,

20:30.771 --> 20:32.022
there's no way...

20:32.731 --> 20:34.441
that you can ever say the word...

20:35.359 --> 20:39.363
"faggot" on our network.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.574
I didn't know I did anything wrong.
I didn't try to defend myself.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.327
I said, "All right. Fuck it,
I'll take it out. Have a good afternoon."

20:45.410 --> 20:47.120
And as I was leaving, it occurred to me.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.248
"Hey. Hey, Renée, quick question.

20:51.458 --> 20:53.210
It's just a question.
Seriously, I wanna know.

20:53.293 --> 20:55.170
Like, wh-why is it... why is it

20:55.254 --> 20:59.800
that... that I can say the word "nigger"
with impunity...

21:10.269 --> 21:12.813
...but I can't say the word "faggot"?"

21:15.107 --> 21:17.317
And she said, "Because, David,

21:17.609 --> 21:20.237
you are not gay."

21:22.114 --> 21:23.532
I said, "Well, Renée...

21:26.827 --> 21:28.203
I'm not a nigger either."

21:45.095 --> 21:47.597
But, you see,
what I didn't realize at the time

21:47.681 --> 21:49.516
and what Kevin had to learn the hard way

21:49.599 --> 21:54.146
is we were breaking an unwritten
and unspoken rule of show business.

21:54.521 --> 21:57.149
And if I say it, you'll know
that I'm telling you the truth.

21:57.232 --> 22:00.986
The rule is that no matter what you do
in your artistic expression,

22:01.069 --> 22:06.366
you are never, ever, allowed to upset...

22:07.617 --> 22:08.827
the alphabet people.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.541
You know who I mean.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.379
Those people that took
20% of the alphabet for themselves.

22:23.675 --> 22:26.928
I'd say the letters,
but I don't want to conjure their anger.

22:28.138 --> 22:29.306
Ah, it's too late now.

22:29.389 --> 22:33.185
I'm talking about them L's
and them B's and them G's

22:33.268 --> 22:35.687
and the T's.

22:37.522 --> 22:40.275
People would be surprised.
I have friends of all kinds of letters.

22:40.359 --> 22:42.361
Everybody loves me and I love everybody.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.113
I got friends who are L's.
I got friends who are B's.

22:45.197 --> 22:47.115
And I got friends who are G's.

22:47.324 --> 22:51.370
But the T's hate my fuckin' guts.

22:56.708 --> 22:57.834
And I don't blame 'em.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.628
It's not their fault. It's mine.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.256
I can't stop telling jokes
about these niggas.

23:04.633 --> 23:07.844
I don't want to write these jokes,
but I just can't stop!

23:14.101 --> 23:16.436
You know, you hear all those letters
together all the time.

23:16.520 --> 23:20.982
"LBGT, LBGT," and you think
it's just one big movement.

23:21.066 --> 23:21.983
It's not.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.529
All those letters are their own movement.

23:25.779 --> 23:28.240
They just travel in the same car together.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.035
And...

23:32.702 --> 23:33.954
my guess is...

23:37.457 --> 23:39.793
Oh!

23:41.420 --> 23:44.381
What is this, high school? This nigga
probably got a babysitter or something.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.925
Go and answer your phone, nigga.
Get that shit out of here.

23:47.008 --> 23:49.261
I'm... I'm in the middle
of something important.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.226
Wouldn't it be funny if we made fun
of him and he's like, "Ha, ha,"

23:56.309 --> 23:58.979
and he went outside like, "Hello?"
"Mama's dead." "Oh, no!"

24:02.315 --> 24:03.191
"Mama's dead."

24:20.208 --> 24:22.544
That was a weird-timed phone call,
wasn't it?

24:24.087 --> 24:25.464
It's like his phone is gay.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.733
Like I was saying...

24:47.903 --> 24:49.196
my guess is...

24:50.363 --> 24:52.199
the G's are driving that car.

24:54.701 --> 24:55.911
That makes sense to me.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.413
'Cause there's white men in the G's.

24:58.914 --> 25:02.751
And these people are trying to get around,
uh, discrimination and oppression,

25:02.834 --> 25:04.419
and you know how white dudes are.

25:04.503 --> 25:05.962
"We know these roads.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.883
In fact, we built these roads.

25:12.886 --> 25:15.680
"The rest of you, buckle up.
We'll get you to where you want to go."

25:17.682 --> 25:19.559
So the G's are just driving the car.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.855
Of course,
next to the G's in the passenger seat...

25:24.356 --> 25:25.440
is the L's.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.527
Everybody likes the L's,

25:29.778 --> 25:31.112
except for the G's.

25:35.784 --> 25:36.993
I don't know what that's about.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.412
I just know the G's don't like them
that much.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.625
The G's always say, like,
little subliminal digs on 'em.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.127
It's unnecessary shit.
It's not mean, but you know what I mean?

25:46.211 --> 25:47.212
They just be like...

25:47.963 --> 25:49.297
"I wouldn't wear that."

25:53.343 --> 25:56.805
And the only thing that breaks the tension
between the L's and the G's

25:56.888 --> 25:58.598
are the B's in the backseat.

25:59.641 --> 26:01.142
That's right. There you go.

26:01.810 --> 26:04.187
Everybody scream out
when you hear your letter.

26:15.949 --> 26:19.494
If there's one thing that the L's
and the G's agree on,

26:19.869 --> 26:22.914
is it's that the B's are fuckin' gross.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.003
They seem greedy to the L's and the G's.
You know what I mean?

26:28.086 --> 26:30.463
'Cause they're just sittin'
in the back seat like, "Yeah, man,

26:30.547 --> 26:34.050
I'll fuck anybody in this car.
What's going on, man?"

26:42.601 --> 26:44.227
And sitting next to the B's,

26:44.311 --> 26:47.939
all the way in the backseat by themselves
looking out the window...

26:50.942 --> 26:52.485
that's the T's.

26:54.779 --> 26:57.741
Everybody in the car respects the T's,

26:57.824 --> 26:59.534
but everyone also...

26:59.993 --> 27:01.578
resents the T's.

27:02.078 --> 27:04.873
It's not the T's' fault,
but everyone in the car just feels like

27:04.956 --> 27:07.917
the T's are making the trip take longer.

27:16.301 --> 27:18.762
Anything the T's say
gets on everybody's nerves.

27:18.845 --> 27:20.764
And then, the T's don't even
say anything bad.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.224
They just be in the back
talking to themselves. "Hm...

27:23.308 --> 27:24.601
"I'm hot."

27:24.684 --> 27:28.313
"Shut up. Shut the fuck up, okay?

27:28.688 --> 27:30.649
You should roll the window down, you...

27:31.358 --> 27:32.984
Bitch, I don't know what you..."

27:35.278 --> 27:37.364
"What?

27:38.406 --> 27:39.949
I just said I was hot.

27:42.410 --> 27:45.830
Can you pull over at the next exit?
I need to use the restroom."

27:47.165 --> 27:50.460
"There is not a restroom for you
for four states, nigga!

27:50.543 --> 27:54.297
Will you just shut the fuck up
so we can get where we're going?"

28:05.392 --> 28:07.894
And just when that car
can't get any more tense,

28:07.977 --> 28:11.272
the Q's are a hitchhiker
that they pick up on the road.

28:11.356 --> 28:14.317
Some white dude in booty shorts
just walking in the freeway.

28:24.077 --> 28:26.621
The G's see him.
"Hm, that guy might be one of us.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.916
Hey, are you okay? You need some help?"

28:29.999 --> 28:32.836
And he come over there with them
booty shorts, leaning on the window.

28:33.294 --> 28:35.088
"Hey, what's going on, fellas?"

28:35.755 --> 28:36.756
Lady.

28:38.258 --> 28:41.010
Whatever pronoun
makes you feel comfortable in the back.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.894
Yeah.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.856
I don't really know where I'm going.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.360
I don't know if I'm gay or I'm straight
or whatever.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.864
All I know for sure is that, um...

29:02.741 --> 29:04.826
I really want to get in this car."

29:12.625 --> 29:16.045
And they make him get in
and sit between the B's and the T's.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.049
I feel bad for T's.

29:20.717 --> 29:22.469
But they're so confusing.

29:23.511 --> 29:24.763
And it's not all my fault.

29:24.846 --> 29:28.057
I-I feel like they need to take
some responsibility for my jokes.

29:30.435 --> 29:32.896
'Cause I didn't come up with this idea
on my own,

29:33.605 --> 29:36.483
this idea that a person can be born
in the wrong body.

29:37.192 --> 29:40.278
But they have to admit
that's a fucking hilarious predicament.

29:41.946 --> 29:43.406
It's really fucking funny.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.659
If it happened to me, you'd laugh.
Wouldn't you?

29:47.744 --> 29:49.579
That wouldn't be funny
if it happened to me?

29:49.662 --> 29:50.955
I think it would be.

29:51.039 --> 29:53.082
What if... What if it did?
What if... What if I was...

29:53.166 --> 29:54.751
What if I was Chinese?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.962
But... But born in this nigga body.
That's not funny?

30:02.592 --> 30:05.428
And for the rest of my life,
I had to go around making that face.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.139
"Hey, everybody, I'm Chinese!"

30:09.140 --> 30:12.268
And everyone gets mad.
"Stop making that face. That's offensive."

30:12.352 --> 30:13.728
-"What?"

30:14.103 --> 30:17.774
"This is how I feel inside."

30:30.370 --> 30:32.997
It's hard not to write these jokes.
It's hard not to think about it.

30:33.081 --> 30:35.875
Even when I watch sports, I'd be thinking
about it. Like, think about it.

30:35.959 --> 30:38.711
Okay, say... say LeBron James,

30:38.962 --> 30:40.755
uh, changed his gender.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.633
You know what I mean? Okay.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.885
Can he stay in the NBA,

30:46.094 --> 30:48.346
or, because he's a woman,

30:49.222 --> 30:51.683
does he have to go to the WNBA

30:51.975 --> 30:55.812
where he will score 840 points a game?

31:00.233 --> 31:04.445
What does it actually mean to be equal?
You know what I mean?

31:05.446 --> 31:07.615
Like, if women are actually equal to men,

31:07.699 --> 31:10.326
then there would be no WNBA, would there?

31:10.952 --> 31:14.956
You would just be good enough
to play in the NBA with us.

31:15.999 --> 31:19.127
Or, here's another idea
that's going to be very controversial,

31:19.419 --> 31:20.420
you could...

31:20.920 --> 31:22.255
shut the fuck up.

31:34.142 --> 31:37.020
I'm sorry, ladies. I just...
I got a fucking Me Too headache.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.605
Y'all is killing me right now.

31:39.689 --> 31:42.233
It's really fuckin' tough
to watch what's going on.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.402
You know, ladies,
I said it in my last special,

31:44.485 --> 31:47.780
and I got in a lot of trouble for this.
I told you, you were right.

31:47.864 --> 31:52.243
But the way you're going about it
is not going to work.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.078
But I'm biased. I said it.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.539
Louis C.K. was a very good friend of mine

31:56.915 --> 31:59.959
before he died
in that terrible masturbation accident.

32:04.923 --> 32:08.468
And it was his room. You read the story.
He was masturbating in his own room.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.136
That's where you supposed to masturbate.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.472
Then he said, "Hey, everybody,
I'm gonna pull my dick out."

32:12.555 --> 32:14.349
Nobody ran for the door
or nothing like that.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.685
They all just kind of hung out, like,
"I wonder if this guy is serious."

32:20.021 --> 32:21.981
And he came on his own stomach.

32:22.065 --> 32:23.107
There it is.

32:24.150 --> 32:25.652
What is the threat?

32:27.403 --> 32:30.531
Have any women ever seen a guy
that just came on his own stomach?

32:30.615 --> 32:33.868
This is the least threatening motherfucker
the Earth has ever seen.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.580
All you see is shame in their face and...

32:38.456 --> 32:40.875
cum dripping down like pancake butter.

32:51.135 --> 32:54.430
He didn't do anything that you can
call the police for. I dare you to try.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.766
Call the police on him.
"Hello? Police, yes.

32:56.849 --> 33:00.395
I am... I am on the other line
with comedian Louis C.K.,

33:00.478 --> 33:06.484
and I think that he is masturbating
while I'm on the phone."

33:07.402 --> 33:09.487
You know what the police are gonna say
in Atlanta?

33:09.988 --> 33:12.115
"Well, what are you guys talking about?

33:14.492 --> 33:16.411
Mm-hm. Mm-hmm."

33:23.793 --> 33:27.171
They ruined this nigga's life, and now
he's coming back playing comedy clubs,

33:27.255 --> 33:30.717
and they acting like if he's able
to do that, that's gonna hurt women.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.385
What the fuck is your agenda, ladies?

33:32.802 --> 33:34.178
Is-- Is sexism dead?

33:34.262 --> 33:36.305
No, in fact, the opposite happened.

33:36.389 --> 33:38.975
I said it was gonna get worse,
and they said I was tone deaf.

33:39.058 --> 33:42.603
But eight states, including your state,

33:43.146 --> 33:48.317
have passed the most stringent
anti-abortion laws

33:48.401 --> 33:51.279
this nation has seen since Roe v. Wade.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.365
I...

33:54.449 --> 33:56.659
I told you. I told you.

33:57.326 --> 34:01.122
I'll be real with you, and I know nobody
gives a fuck what I think anyway.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.623
-Uh...

34:02.707 --> 34:04.250
I'm not for abortion.

34:05.043 --> 34:06.961
-Oh, shut up, nigga.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.932
I'm not for it,
but I'm not against it either.

34:23.311 --> 34:25.271
It all depends...

34:25.855 --> 34:27.190
on who I get pregnant.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.240
I don't care-- I'll tell you right now.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.826
I don't care what your religious beliefs
are or anything.

34:38.910 --> 34:43.247
If you have a dick, you need
to shut the fuck up on this one.

34:43.331 --> 34:44.499
Seriously.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.255
This is theirs.

34:52.507 --> 34:55.635
The right to choose
is their unequivocal right.

34:55.718 --> 34:57.845
Not only do I believe
they have the right to choose,

34:57.929 --> 35:00.807
I believe that they shouldn't
have to consult anybody,

35:01.140 --> 35:03.810
-except for a physician...

35:03.893 --> 35:06.979
...about how they exercise that right.

35:07.355 --> 35:09.190
Gentleman, that is fair.

35:10.066 --> 35:12.443
And ladies, to be fair to us,

35:13.444 --> 35:16.948
I also believe
if you decide to have the baby,

35:18.032 --> 35:19.700
a man should not have to pay.

35:25.706 --> 35:26.624
That's fair.

35:27.250 --> 35:30.461
If you can kill this motherfucker,
I can at least abandon 'em.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.258
It's my money, my choice.

35:40.930 --> 35:43.975
And if I'm wrong,
then perhaps we're wrong.

35:44.517 --> 35:46.644
So, figure that shit out for yourselves.

35:56.279 --> 35:58.614
I mean, really, uh,
what the fuck are we doing?

35:59.448 --> 36:02.076
I can't live in this new world
you're proposing.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.537
And meanwhile, while we're worrying
about this other shit,

36:04.620 --> 36:05.621
look at what's happening.

36:05.705 --> 36:09.083
They just killed another 12 people
in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.668
This shit's happening every week.

36:10.751 --> 36:13.462
It happens so much, I'm almost--
I don't care anymore.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.257
I came home early from the road.

36:17.675 --> 36:20.720
I had a $12,000 suit on,
'cause life's been going good.

36:23.431 --> 36:26.017
And I got home early,
and dinner was cookin'.

36:26.100 --> 36:28.811
You ever come home when dinner's cookin'?
Doesn't that smell good?

36:28.895 --> 36:32.648
And my son saw me, and he was like,
"Dad's home."

36:32.732 --> 36:35.234
And he got up from the table
and ran over to give me a hug,

36:35.318 --> 36:37.486
but he had chicken grease
all over his face,

36:37.570 --> 36:40.406
so I stiffed on him,
like, "Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, my man, my man.

36:41.407 --> 36:43.576
Watch these threads, son.
This is an expensive suit.

36:43.659 --> 36:46.287
I don't want you
to get that chicken grease all over me."

36:46.370 --> 36:47.997
A-And he was like,
"What the f...

36:48.080 --> 36:49.248
Chicken grease?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.626
Dad, this is duck."

36:56.380 --> 36:57.215
Hmm.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.383
A tear came out of my eyes.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.303
I never dreamt I'd do so well in life

37:02.386 --> 37:06.098
that I'd raise a nigga
with duck grease all over his face.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.735
And we sat down,
we just talked about everything.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.363
I was telling my wife
about how my shows were going,

37:20.446 --> 37:23.407
and I told her my trans jokes,
and she was like, "Oh, I hate that joke."

37:23.491 --> 37:26.244
And you know why she hates the joke?
'Cause she's Asian.

37:27.995 --> 37:31.040
But you know what I mean?
I don't make that face at the house,

37:31.123 --> 37:33.000
u-unless we're really fightin'.

37:41.676 --> 37:44.011
And me and her, we weren't arguing,
but you know what I mean?

37:44.095 --> 37:47.265
She's like, "You need to stop doing that."
And then, I tried to change the subject.

37:47.348 --> 37:48.766
"Oh, how is school going, boys?"

37:48.849 --> 37:52.103
And my son's telling me, "Well,
we didn't have school today, technically."

37:52.186 --> 37:53.604
I'm like, "What... What's going on?"

37:53.688 --> 37:56.440
He said, "Well there was, like,
a school shooting drill."

37:56.524 --> 37:58.734
I never heard of this.
You know what this is?

37:58.818 --> 38:01.654
They have drills that they make kids do,

38:01.737 --> 38:03.406
uh, where they practice what to do

38:03.489 --> 38:05.116
if somebody comes
to shoot up their school.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.493
I'd never heard of that before.
I was like, "What the fuck?"

38:08.411 --> 38:11.080
I had to tell my sons the truth.
I didn't want to tell them this shit.

38:11.163 --> 38:12.039
"Son...

38:13.040 --> 38:14.500
Son, listen to me.

38:15.668 --> 38:16.794
Fuck that drill.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.465
If somebody comes to your school
and wants to shoot it up,

38:21.549 --> 38:23.259
I'm just gonna be honest with you.

38:25.177 --> 38:27.930
You probably gonna get shot, nigga.
I'm just being real.

38:29.807 --> 38:32.226
You got a famous dad.
I talk a lot of shit.

38:32.476 --> 38:34.895
They gonna be gunning for you,
little buddy.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.859
Just stay low and run in a zigzag pattern,

38:39.942 --> 38:43.863
and don't try to save anybody, son.
Do you understand me?"

38:49.660 --> 38:53.164
Why would you have kids rehearse
for some shit they have no control over?

38:53.247 --> 38:55.374
All you're doing is training these kids
to worry.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.126
It's the stupidest drill
I've ever heard of.

38:57.209 --> 39:00.546
And while you're in there training 'em
during these drills,

39:02.214 --> 39:04.216
well, aren't you
training the shooter, too?

39:04.300 --> 39:07.345
This nigga's in here listening
and learning like the other kids.

39:07.428 --> 39:08.596
Sittin' in the back...

39:10.639 --> 39:12.516
"So, where are we supposed to meet?

39:14.268 --> 39:15.144
Okay."

39:15.811 --> 39:16.896
All right.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.323
If you're a parent,
this shit is terrifying.

39:27.615 --> 39:28.699
This shit is real scary.

39:28.783 --> 39:31.327
All the parents
is looking at each other crazy,

39:31.911 --> 39:35.373
because we know, as parents,
that one of us

39:35.456 --> 39:36.999
is raising the shooter.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.463
We just don't know which one of us it is.

39:44.048 --> 39:45.800
All we know for sure...

39:47.093 --> 39:50.179
is that if you're a white parent,
the chances that it's you...

39:53.891 --> 39:56.936
...it's exponentially higher
than the rest of us.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.899
Shooting up school is a white kids' game.

40:04.985 --> 40:07.196
It's fuckin' crazy.
You know, I hated school, too.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.697
It never occurred to me...

40:09.824 --> 40:12.118
kill everybody in school?

40:13.494 --> 40:14.870
It's fuckin' crazy.

40:16.288 --> 40:18.416
Just do what I did, nigga.
Try some things.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.709
"Have you skipped school, nigga?
Skip school!

40:22.336 --> 40:25.297
Take a walk and meet some other kids.
Fuck school, nigga.

40:26.799 --> 40:29.677
Try drugs. Have you tried drugs out?
Nigga, that might..."

40:37.184 --> 40:38.436
Some scary shit.

40:39.895 --> 40:41.522
I've given this a lot of thought.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.816
I don't see any peaceful way

40:44.316 --> 40:46.318
to disarm America's whites.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.794
There's only one thing that's going
to save this country from itself.

41:04.128 --> 41:06.839
Same thing that always saves
this country from itself,

41:07.339 --> 41:09.175
and that is African Americans.

41:12.303 --> 41:13.137
Right.

41:14.763 --> 41:18.017
And I know the question
that a lot of y'all have in your minds is,

41:18.476 --> 41:19.518
"Should we do it?"

41:22.730 --> 41:24.231
Yeah. Fuck yeah, we should do it.

41:24.315 --> 41:27.776
Listen, no matter what they say
or how they make you feel,

41:27.860 --> 41:31.989
remember, this is your country, too.

41:32.615 --> 41:35.451
-It is incumbent upon us...

41:36.035 --> 41:38.537
to save our country.

41:39.413 --> 41:41.332
And you know what we have to do.

41:41.415 --> 41:44.043
This is a fuckin' election year.
We gotta be serious.

41:44.126 --> 41:46.879
Every able-bodied African American

41:46.962 --> 41:48.881
must register

41:48.964 --> 41:51.008
for a legal firearm.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.981
That's the only way
they'll change the law.

42:16.325 --> 42:18.077
I hate guns, personally.

42:19.119 --> 42:20.287
I can't stand 'em.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.040
Yeah, but I have several.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.337
I don't want 'em,
but I feel like I need 'em.

42:28.420 --> 42:31.048
Don't forget where I live. I live in Ohio.

42:31.131 --> 42:35.302
And anyone that knows anything about Ohio
knows that even the word "Ohio"

42:35.386 --> 42:38.430
is an old Native American word.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.599
It means, literally,

42:41.100 --> 42:43.894
uh, "land of poor white people."

42:49.984 --> 42:51.902
And I don't know
what's going on down here,

42:51.986 --> 42:53.988
but in my experience, uh,

42:54.071 --> 42:55.864
poor white people love,

42:56.240 --> 42:59.159
and, I mean, they fucking <i>love...</i>

42:59.743 --> 43:00.744
heroin.

43:03.789 --> 43:05.624
They can't seem to get enough of it.

43:06.166 --> 43:08.711
I didn't know what I was looking at
at first. I was driving, like,

43:08.794 --> 43:11.380
"Why are all these white people
so sleepy out here?"

43:17.011 --> 43:18.429
It's really bad.

43:19.221 --> 43:21.265
Matter of fact,
I was coming out of the nightclub

43:21.348 --> 43:24.351
the other night in Dayton,
and I had parked my car in the alley,

43:24.435 --> 43:26.729
and no one was out.
I didn't have no bodyguards or nothing.

43:26.812 --> 43:28.439
I was home. I figured everything was fine.

43:28.522 --> 43:30.774
And as soon as I open my car door,

43:31.066 --> 43:32.026
all by myself,

43:32.109 --> 43:33.027
suddenly,

43:33.110 --> 43:36.530
uh, one of these heroin-addicted whites
just pops out of a trash can.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.240
It scared the shit out of me. I screamed.

43:38.324 --> 43:39.742
"Aah!"

43:44.079 --> 43:46.373
And then, I realized it was a woman.
She was fucked up.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.916
She was like...

43:48.000 --> 43:49.335
"Hey, man.

43:49.668 --> 43:51.587
Hey, man. Relax, okay?

43:52.671 --> 43:54.006
I'm sick, all right?

43:54.089 --> 43:56.508
I need some drugs, man.

43:56.592 --> 44:01.805
Please? I'll suck your dick
for five dollars, man."

44:01.889 --> 44:03.265
I was like, "Ick...

44:05.017 --> 44:05.851
Two."

44:24.119 --> 44:25.496
Obviously, I'm joking.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.875
This opioid crisis is a crisis.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.670
I see it everyday.
It's as bad as they say.

44:33.671 --> 44:35.297
It's ruining lives, it's...

44:35.756 --> 44:37.091
destroying families.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.510
Sadly, you know what it reminds me of?
Seeing it?

44:40.511 --> 44:42.096
Reminds me of us.

44:43.055 --> 44:47.643
These white folks look exactly like us
during the crack epidemic.

44:48.852 --> 44:50.813
You know, it's really crazy to see.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.732
And all this shit
they talk about on the news

44:53.816 --> 44:55.567
about how divided the nation is,

44:55.651 --> 44:57.361
I don't believe it. I feel like, nowadays,

44:57.444 --> 45:00.030
we're gettin' a real good look
at each other.

45:01.740 --> 45:05.619
It's wild, because I even have insight
into how the white community

45:05.703 --> 45:10.499
must've felt watching the black community
go through the scourge of crack...

45:11.458 --> 45:12.960
because I don't care either.

45:17.464 --> 45:19.007
"Hang in there, Whites.

45:20.968 --> 45:24.388
Just say no. What's so hard about that?"

45:36.984 --> 45:39.695
Remember when y'all said that to us?
But it's okay.

45:39.778 --> 45:42.156
There's no grudges.
Now you finally got it right.

45:42.239 --> 45:45.534
Once it started happening to your kids,
you realize it's a health crisis.

45:45.617 --> 45:46.910
These people are sick.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.412
They are not criminals.

45:48.495 --> 45:50.372
They are sick.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.921
Be that as it may,

45:59.339 --> 46:00.674
I'm armed to the teeth.

46:05.220 --> 46:07.890
First gun I bought was a 12-gauge shotgun.

46:09.349 --> 46:11.894
I didn't want the gun.
Remember, though, I'd moved to a farm

46:11.977 --> 46:13.437
and I was sittin' on the porch,

46:13.520 --> 46:16.398
and I see a white dude
walking across my property,

46:16.482 --> 46:18.192
entitled, like he's supposed to be there.

46:18.275 --> 46:20.611
He had a rifle over his shoulder, too.
Ain't that a bitch?

46:24.656 --> 46:27.910
I said, "What the fuck is this guy doing
on my property?"

46:27.993 --> 46:29.369
I was mad as shit,

46:29.828 --> 46:31.789
but I was unarmed.

46:32.539 --> 46:35.584
So, I ended up just waving
to this motherfucker like a bitch.

46:35.667 --> 46:36.627
I was just, like...

46:44.676 --> 46:46.553
And as soon as he got far enough away,

46:46.637 --> 46:49.223
I ran to my car and sped to Kmart.

46:51.934 --> 46:53.852
This is in a rural white area.

46:53.936 --> 46:57.064
And remember, I was nervous,
'cause the guy was on my property,

46:57.147 --> 46:59.191
I'm black, and I was sweating.

46:59.274 --> 47:01.860
You know what I mean?
And I ran to the gun counter.

47:01.944 --> 47:03.111
Black and sweaty,

47:03.487 --> 47:04.738
sweating and black,

47:04.822 --> 47:06.907
and I looked up and I was like...

47:06.990 --> 47:08.742
I looked like a slave or something.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.081
I said, "I need a gun. Immediately."
Like that.

47:14.581 --> 47:15.457
Just like that.

47:16.124 --> 47:18.085
The guy didn't ask no questions,
he just...

47:18.168 --> 47:20.671
grabbed a 12-gauge shotgun,
handed it to me.

47:20.754 --> 47:23.423
I'd never even held a gun before.
I'm like...

47:24.383 --> 47:26.510
"Well, I need...
I need some bullets, too."

47:27.219 --> 47:30.848
And the guy reached under the counter,
put two boxes of shells on the counter.

47:30.931 --> 47:33.433
He said, "All right, buddy.
Which box do you want?"

47:33.892 --> 47:34.935
I didn't know.

47:35.769 --> 47:38.021
One box had a picture of some ducks on it.

47:39.314 --> 47:41.400
The other box had a picture of some deer.

47:42.317 --> 47:45.445
I said, "Well, what's that box
with them ducks?"

47:46.864 --> 47:49.366
He said, "Oh, that there's bird shot."

47:50.200 --> 47:52.953
And then he goes just like this,
I'm not exaggerating, he goes,

47:53.787 --> 47:55.038
"That won't kill a man."

48:03.088 --> 48:05.465
He said,
"It'll just pepper him up nicely."

48:05.549 --> 48:07.551
I said, "What the fuck? Pepper?"

48:11.805 --> 48:14.349
You know what it means
to pepper a motherfucker up?

48:14.433 --> 48:17.269
It means that when the shell explodes,

48:17.352 --> 48:20.647
hot BBs will shoot out
of the barrel of the gun,

48:20.731 --> 48:22.065
not killing a motherfucker,

48:22.149 --> 48:24.902
but penetrating their skin
and shallow flesh.

48:24.985 --> 48:26.653
Boy, that's gotta hurt.

48:26.737 --> 48:27.696
Hot BBs?

48:29.114 --> 48:30.616
"Aah! Aaaah!"

48:32.200 --> 48:34.953
Remember when Dick Cheney
shot a motherfucker in the face

48:35.037 --> 48:36.079
and he lived?

48:36.163 --> 48:37.497
That was bird shot.

48:39.791 --> 48:42.044
I said, "Well, what's that box
with the deer on it?"

48:42.127 --> 48:44.421
He goes, "Oh, that there is buckshot.

48:44.963 --> 48:47.925
That'll put a hole in a goddamn truck
if you wanted to.

48:50.302 --> 48:52.012
So, which box do you want?"

48:52.095 --> 48:54.681
And he picked the one with the deer up
and shook it.

49:01.271 --> 49:04.775
I thought he was trying to trick me.
I was like, "Do you have a box, uh,

49:04.858 --> 49:08.070
with a picture of a white dude trespassing
on it? 'Cause...

49:09.613 --> 49:11.990
....that's exactly
the strength I'm looking for.

49:15.786 --> 49:19.581
But I didn't know that if you're defending
your home with a shotgun,

49:19.665 --> 49:22.876
the formula dictates that you're supposed
to buy both boxes.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.295
This was not a formula
that I was familiar with.

49:25.379 --> 49:28.507
It goes like this: there's six shots
in a 12-gauge shotgun.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.842
So when you load the gun,
you load it like this.

49:30.926 --> 49:32.803
First shot, bird shot.

49:32.886 --> 49:34.888
Next shot, buckshot.

49:34.972 --> 49:38.141
Bird shot, and then after that,
gun's Jamaican.

49:38.225 --> 49:39.726
Buckshot, buckshot, buckshot.

49:45.857 --> 49:48.902
But you gotta picture it. Okay, like,
say I'm in bed and I'm sleepin',

49:49.695 --> 49:51.238
and suddenly, my wife wakes me up.

49:51.321 --> 49:53.281
"David. David, wake up!"

49:53.699 --> 49:55.158
And I'm like, "Uh, oh.

49:55.575 --> 49:56.868
Look who's come around."

49:56.952 --> 50:00.205
And I pull my dick over the top
of my pajamas.

50:09.047 --> 50:11.800
And she's says, "No, I hear somethin'."

50:11.883 --> 50:13.301
I go, "Oh, this bitch."

50:13.385 --> 50:14.636
So I get up out of bed...

50:16.471 --> 50:18.473
Uh, grab the gun.

50:19.307 --> 50:21.101
I say, "Wait here, baby.
I'll go check it out.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.561
Just lock the door behind me."

50:24.563 --> 50:26.273
Oh, my God, she's right.

50:26.732 --> 50:30.402
Right there in the kitchen
is a heroin-addicted white and...

50:32.988 --> 50:35.657
he's digging through the change jar
by the door.

50:36.867 --> 50:39.286
"I work really hard for that change.
I gotta do something."

50:39.369 --> 50:41.163
So, first, I rack the shotgun.

50:41.246 --> 50:43.123
"Hey, motherfucker!" Click-clack.

50:44.750 --> 50:45.834
That's a test.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.087
That click-clack sound will stop

50:49.421 --> 50:52.758
a rational human being in their tracks.

50:53.341 --> 50:55.677
But, sure enough,
this person is not rational.

50:55.761 --> 50:58.096
They're sick on drugs.
They're digging in the change.

50:59.222 --> 51:01.975
I gotta act fast.
This nigga's almost got $1.50.

51:06.229 --> 51:07.564
"I warned you."

51:07.647 --> 51:08.815
Bird shot!

51:08.899 --> 51:10.150
And there it goes.

51:10.233 --> 51:15.614
Hot BB's will permeate
his yellow heroin skin.

51:15.697 --> 51:19.159
Remember, I'm not killing him,
I'm just "peppering him up nice."

51:21.036 --> 51:23.205
He lets out a heroin scream.

51:23.413 --> 51:25.415
No!

51:32.506 --> 51:34.007
And that should be the end of it.

51:34.674 --> 51:35.842
But... Uh-oh.

51:36.259 --> 51:37.427
I miscalculated.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.429
While he's on the ground screaming,

51:39.513 --> 51:42.849
I notice that his teeth
are horribly miscolored.

51:43.725 --> 51:45.435
That's not heroin at all, is it?

51:45.519 --> 51:46.728
That's crystal meth.

51:46.812 --> 51:48.855
He pops right back up, unscathed.

51:54.736 --> 51:55.862
Time for the heavy stuff.

51:55.946 --> 51:56.905
Clack-clack.

51:56.988 --> 51:58.323
Buckshot!

52:00.826 --> 52:04.329
And then, if he got a friend with him,
I got one more bird shot left.

52:04.579 --> 52:05.872
And I repeat the cycle.

52:05.956 --> 52:08.416
After that nigga,
it's slugs for everybody.

52:10.043 --> 52:12.754
And I'll be in a kitchen
full of dying heroin addicts,

52:13.338 --> 52:15.423
saying stupid heroin last words.

52:17.717 --> 52:20.095
"You shot me, bro."

52:21.179 --> 52:24.141
"Oh, it hurts, man.

52:24.432 --> 52:25.934
It hurts. Ah."

52:26.017 --> 52:29.146
Their last words are always
the dumbest words, like...

52:29.521 --> 52:30.730
"Why is your dick out?"

52:45.412 --> 52:48.331
I'm just afraid of being attacked.

52:49.249 --> 52:50.417
It happens to the best of us.

52:50.500 --> 52:52.836
Don't ever forget what happened
to that French actor.

52:54.921 --> 52:56.214
You know who I'm talking about.

52:56.298 --> 52:59.050
Jussie Smollett, he's a very French...

52:59.134 --> 53:00.886
A very famous French actor.

53:09.603 --> 53:11.521
Y'all never heard of Jussie Smollett?

53:14.316 --> 53:17.360
Jussie Smollett is an actor from France.

53:25.160 --> 53:29.998
A-And he became famous
on a show called <i>Empire.</i>

53:33.585 --> 53:34.544
And one night,

53:35.295 --> 53:37.214
he was in Chicago late at night,

53:38.340 --> 53:39.716
and was the victim...

53:49.351 --> 53:53.730
He was the victim of a racist
and homophobic attack.

53:53.813 --> 53:56.358
You see, Jussie Smollett is...

53:58.443 --> 54:00.654
gay, and he is black,

54:00.737 --> 54:01.947
not just French.

54:08.328 --> 54:09.913
Oh, it was a crazy story.

54:10.789 --> 54:13.959
Apparently, when he's walking
down the street late at night,

54:14.042 --> 54:16.169
two white men came out of the shadows,

54:16.253 --> 54:17.462
uh...

54:17.545 --> 54:19.547
with MAGA hats on and beat him up.

54:20.674 --> 54:23.969
Tied a rope around his neck,
called him all kinds of niggas and...

54:24.052 --> 54:24.886
and...

54:25.262 --> 54:27.722
put some bleach on him
and ran off into the night.

54:29.766 --> 54:32.769
This shit was, like, international news.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.230
And everybody was furious,

54:35.313 --> 54:36.690
especially in Hollywood.

54:36.773 --> 54:39.442
It's all over everybody's Twitter feed
and Instagram page.

54:39.526 --> 54:41.486
"Justice for Jussie" and all this shit.

54:46.074 --> 54:47.450
The whole country was up in arms.

54:47.534 --> 54:49.452
We was talking about it all the time
on the news,

54:49.536 --> 54:51.246
and... and, for some reason,

54:51.746 --> 54:55.750
uh, African Americans,
we were like oddly quiet.

54:59.504 --> 55:01.464
We were so quiet about this shit

55:02.257 --> 55:05.885
that the gay community started accusing
the African American community

55:05.969 --> 55:08.888
of being homophobic
for not supporting him.

55:08.972 --> 55:13.143
But what they didn't understand
is that we were supporting him

55:13.226 --> 55:14.894
with our silence.

55:16.479 --> 55:18.773
Because we understood

55:19.149 --> 55:22.694
that this nigga was clearly lying.

55:30.493 --> 55:34.039
None of these details added up at all.

55:35.206 --> 55:37.292
He said he's walking down the street
in Chicago

55:37.375 --> 55:40.545
and-and, uh, white dudes
come up to him and say,

55:40.628 --> 55:43.965
"Hey, man, aren't you that faggot nigger
from <i>Empire?"</i>

55:44.215 --> 55:45.342
What the fuck?

55:45.717 --> 55:48.261
Does that sound like
how white people talk?

55:49.971 --> 55:52.015
I know white people.
They don't talk like that.

55:52.098 --> 55:55.185
"Are you that faggot nigger from <i>Empire?"</i>
They would never say that.

55:55.268 --> 55:57.062
It sounds like something...

55:58.063 --> 55:59.314
that I would say.

56:08.406 --> 56:10.325
If you're racist and homophobic,

56:10.408 --> 56:13.536
you don't even know who this nigga is.
You can't watch <i>Empire.</i>

56:19.459 --> 56:21.169
Black people never feel sorry
for the police,

56:21.252 --> 56:23.129
but this time,
we even felt sorry for the police.

56:23.213 --> 56:25.799
Can you imagine
if you was a police veteran

56:25.882 --> 56:27.384
taking this kid's police report?

56:27.467 --> 56:30.053
"Okay, Mr. Smollett.
Please, tell me what happened."

56:31.221 --> 56:33.973
"All right, you... 2:00 a.m.

56:34.307 --> 56:37.394
You left the house at 2:00 a.m.
It was minus 16 degrees and...

56:37.477 --> 56:39.062
-All right.

56:41.106 --> 56:44.192
You were walking? You were walking.
All right.

56:48.029 --> 56:50.031
And... and where were you going?

56:51.074 --> 56:51.908
Subway?

56:52.992 --> 56:54.202
Sandwiches?

57:04.337 --> 57:05.922
That's when the men approached you?

57:06.005 --> 57:07.590
Did you see them? Do you have any--

57:07.674 --> 57:09.134
Okay, what did they have on?

57:09.467 --> 57:10.718
MAGA hats?

57:11.845 --> 57:13.805
MAGA hats on in Chicago?

57:14.639 --> 57:16.099
Excuse me, one second, Mr. Smollett.

57:16.182 --> 57:17.684
Frank, come here for a second.

57:21.855 --> 57:23.982
Find out where Kanye West was last night."

57:37.454 --> 57:39.914
Such a fucking outrageous story.

57:39.998 --> 57:43.001
He said they put a rope around his neck.

57:43.084 --> 57:45.003
Has anyone here ever been to Chicago?

57:45.086 --> 57:45.920
Yes!

57:46.337 --> 57:48.631
All right. All right,
so you've been there.

57:48.715 --> 57:52.010
Now, tell me, how much rope
do you remember seeing?

57:53.803 --> 57:55.180
Who the fuck is carrying rope?

57:55.263 --> 57:57.974
Like, when did you get mugged, nigga,
in 1850?

57:58.057 --> 57:59.809
-Who's got rope?
<i>-</i>

57:59.893 --> 58:01.269
Who's got rope?

58:06.065 --> 58:07.358
Man, that shit was awful.

58:07.442 --> 58:08.860
So, okay.

58:09.277 --> 58:12.071
I'm doing a show somewhere,
and I'm on stage,

58:12.155 --> 58:14.282
and I was a little drunk, you know.

58:16.034 --> 58:18.495
I figured, "Fuck, let me talk
about that nigga a little bit."

58:18.578 --> 58:22.081
I figured it'd be safe, 'cause, you know,
everybody's phones are locked up...

58:24.876 --> 58:27.462
And I went in on this kid.
I was talking all kinds of shit.

58:27.545 --> 58:29.005
Now, I didn't know

58:29.297 --> 58:32.175
that there was a journalist
in the audience.

58:32.675 --> 58:34.344
And unfortunately for me,

58:34.761 --> 58:35.929
that motherfucker...

58:37.013 --> 58:38.973
took impeccable notes.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.063
He told everybody everything I said.

58:45.146 --> 58:46.940
He was even puttin' the jokes
in the headline.

58:47.023 --> 58:49.734
The headline said, "Dave Chappelle Says

58:49.817 --> 58:53.988
He Wants To Smash A Dollhouse
Over Jussie Smollett's Head."

59:04.082 --> 59:06.209
I thought for sure
when I read that headline, I said,

59:06.292 --> 59:08.461
"Well, that's it for me. I'm canceled."

59:10.630 --> 59:11.798
But lucky for me,

59:11.881 --> 59:13.550
that very same day,

59:13.633 --> 59:17.303
the Chicago police caught
the motherfuckers that actually did it,

59:17.679 --> 59:22.141
and, hilariously,
they were both, uh, Nigerian.

59:23.393 --> 59:26.521
Not only were they not white,
they were very, very black.

59:26.604 --> 59:29.148
They were Nigerian,
which is the funniest shit.

59:29.232 --> 59:31.276
The whole story is funnier now.

59:31.359 --> 59:32.944
"This is MAGA country,

59:33.027 --> 59:35.363
you faggot nigger."

59:38.491 --> 59:40.702
"You faggot nigger."

59:47.125 --> 59:50.169
If... If you're in a group
that I made fun of,

59:50.253 --> 59:53.214
then just know that I probably will only
make fun of you

59:53.298 --> 59:55.008
if I see myself in you.

59:55.091 --> 59:56.968
I make fun of poor white people

59:57.051 --> 59:59.470
because I was once poor.

1:00:00.638 --> 1:00:02.432
And I know that the only difference

1:00:02.515 --> 1:00:05.476
between a poor black person
and a poor white person

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:07.145
is that a poor white person

1:00:07.228 --> 1:00:10.315
feels like it's not supposed
to be happening to them.

1:00:14.444 --> 1:00:15.695
Yeah!

1:00:16.863 --> 1:00:18.531
Everything else is the same.

1:00:19.616 --> 1:00:21.534
I know what it's like
to have a cold house.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:25.496
I wasn't allowed to touch the thermostat
growing up without asking my father,

1:00:25.580 --> 1:00:27.415
and it would be fuckin' freezing
in the house.

1:00:27.498 --> 1:00:30.501
I'd be like, "Dad, please.
Can I please just turn the heat up

1:00:30.585 --> 1:00:33.630
to, like, I don't know, 32, nigga?
It's really cold."

1:00:38.343 --> 1:00:41.429
And my dad would say,
"Just put more clothes on, David."

1:00:42.263 --> 1:00:44.057
"I got all three of my outfits on, nigga.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.267
Will you look at me?
I'm freezing up here."

1:00:47.769 --> 1:00:50.647
And he said, "Just don't think
about how cold you are, David."

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:53.066
And I said this. I didn't say it to him,

1:00:53.149 --> 1:00:55.318
but I said it in front of him
so he could hear.

1:00:55.401 --> 1:00:58.154
I said, "I fuckin' hate being poor."

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:01.199
And my dad got really upset.

1:01:01.449 --> 1:01:03.576
He didn't scream or howl.
That wasn't his way.

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:07.413
He just threw his newspaper on the floor,
and he said, "David, David, David.

1:01:08.414 --> 1:01:10.708
You are not poor."

1:01:11.501 --> 1:01:15.046
He said, "Poor is a mentality."

1:01:18.007 --> 1:01:23.346
He said, "It's a mentality
that very few people ever recover from.

1:01:23.429 --> 1:01:25.098
Don't you forget it, son.

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:27.558
You are broke."

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:37.276
He said, "These are just
financial circumstances

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:40.071
that I hope to overcome
one day very soon."

1:01:40.154 --> 1:01:42.615
And I said, "Well, Dad,
whatever you want to call this,

1:01:42.699 --> 1:01:44.784
uh, it's wildly uncomfortable."

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:50.707
There was a big dance coming up
in the middle school.

1:01:50.790 --> 1:01:53.126
I was 12 years old.
I said, "Dad, can I go to the dance?"

1:01:53.209 --> 1:01:54.419
He said, "Of course you can go.

1:01:54.502 --> 1:01:56.295
I want you to get out
and meet some more kids."

1:01:56.379 --> 1:01:59.507
I said, "Great. Uh, it costs three dollars
to get in."

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:01.509
And my dad said, "Ooh...

1:02:03.636 --> 1:02:05.388
Sorry, son, uh...

1:02:06.055 --> 1:02:07.056
I don't have it."

1:02:07.515 --> 1:02:12.186
I was like, "What the fuck?
You don't have three dollars?

1:02:13.187 --> 1:02:15.106
Well, then, how are we alive, Dad?

1:02:20.236 --> 1:02:22.613
Wish I found some way
out of this hell!

1:02:23.030 --> 1:02:24.490
I'd do anything to not be poor.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:27.869
I will show Michael Jackson my anus
if I get a chance.

1:02:29.036 --> 1:02:30.872
I just gotta get out of this hell."

1:02:35.251 --> 1:02:38.421
Dad said, "If you want to go to the dance
bad enough, I'll tell you what.

1:02:38.504 --> 1:02:41.591
There's some money in the change jar,
get the money from there."

1:02:41.674 --> 1:02:43.217
I was 12 years old. That's what I did.

1:02:43.301 --> 1:02:44.677
I showed up to the dance early.

1:02:44.761 --> 1:02:46.721
There's a long line of kids
waiting behind me

1:02:46.804 --> 1:02:50.308
while I'm at the door, trying to count out
300 pennies to get inside.

1:02:50.683 --> 1:02:54.479
I will never forget this shit
as long as I fuckin' live.

1:02:54.562 --> 1:02:57.398
Oh, man, you know. If you've been poor,
you know what that feels like.

1:02:57.482 --> 1:02:58.775
You ashamed all the time.

1:02:58.858 --> 1:03:00.151
Feels like it's your fault.

1:03:00.234 --> 1:03:02.403
And all them kids was laughing,
"Ha, ha, ha,

1:03:02.487 --> 1:03:03.780
look how poor Dave Chappelle is."

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:04.697
Oh.

1:03:05.239 --> 1:03:06.449
Like, when I think back at it,

1:03:06.532 --> 1:03:10.328
that was really the only time in my life
that I ever thought to myself,

1:03:11.245 --> 1:03:13.790
"I should kill everybody at school."

1:03:20.254 --> 1:03:21.964
Thank you very much, everybody,

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:23.007
and good night.
