01:44.400 --> 01:45.400
Hey, dog!

01:45.480 --> 01:47.608
I caught us some dinner!

01:50.720 --> 01:52.688
Pancakes?

01:57.880 --> 01:58.927
Aah!

02:03.800 --> 02:06.371
Pancakes!

03:03.040 --> 03:04.326
Now, you're gonna love it.

03:04.327 --> 03:07.319
There's no professors,
there's no papers,

03:07.320 --> 03:09.687
there's just peace and relaxation,
the entire time.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.971
And relentless pounding
for, like, six days.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.559
Gross. And beer!

03:17.560 --> 03:19.439
Don't forget about the beer.

03:19.440 --> 03:22.250
And how can we forget about beer
with you in the car?

03:49.800 --> 03:50.847
Rise and shine!

03:51.360 --> 03:54.170
Aah, such an asshole.

04:04.720 --> 04:06.961
I gave up two weeks
in Belize for this?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.240
Oh, come on.

04:08.560 --> 04:09.480
You're gonna like it.

04:09.481 --> 04:11.401
The cabin's gonna be great.
You're gonna love it.

04:11.600 --> 04:12.886
Mm-hm.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.731
Creepy.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.525
Hey, there, little man.

04:39.640 --> 04:40.880
Dammit!

04:41.040 --> 04:42.087
- God!
- Oh!

04:43.723 --> 04:45.927
The hell's goin' on out here?

04:47.480 --> 04:48.766
Dennis!

04:49.240 --> 04:51.843
Goddammit! What'd I tell you
about biting city folk?

04:51.844 --> 04:53.729
Hey, it's not his fault.
Take it easy on him.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.839
Take it easy?

04:57.840 --> 05:01.322
Don't you tell me
how to raise my boy, boy.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.930
Dennis isn't like
the other children.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.568
Everybody knows
you don't talk to 'em.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.770
Maybe you should make a sign,
for the rest of us.

05:11.760 --> 05:12.921
Come on, get outta here.

05:16.440 --> 05:18.920
There's a hose around back,
you wanna wash that hand up.

05:19.120 --> 05:20.963
It's the best I can offer.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.770
- Paul, you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

05:24.960 --> 05:26.405
Hey, "Deliverance"!

05:27.320 --> 05:28.765
Think it's smart
leaving your kid out here

05:28.766 --> 05:30.603
knowing he's a danger to people?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.959
What are you trying
to say exactly?

05:33.960 --> 05:34.960
What I'm saying is...

05:35.360 --> 05:36.441
that such an incident

05:36.442 --> 05:38.761
were to result in a lawsuit,
you may be held liable.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.928
We don't know nothin'
about that around here.

05:41.640 --> 05:43.165
Come on, Tommy.

05:48.520 --> 05:51.599
Peace and relaxation, remember?

05:51.600 --> 05:53.443
God.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.606
What just happened?

06:08.240 --> 06:10.481
Aah, shit.

06:14.720 --> 06:17.326
Freakin' hillbilly vampires.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.599
I'd be careful with that.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.959
What is it?

06:33.960 --> 06:35.962
This is... fox piss.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.679
You'd even drop that on ya,

06:38.680 --> 06:41.204
you'll have every animal in the county
wanting to hump your leg.

06:41.205 --> 06:42.205
Hmm.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.609
You should get some of that
for your mom.

06:44.880 --> 06:45.880
Hmm.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.327
I'm gonna go get the beer.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.966
You kids here on vacation
or you just passin' through?

06:52.200 --> 06:53.200
Vacation.

06:53.440 --> 06:55.886
Ah. Well.

06:56.080 --> 06:59.527
I hope you enjoy our little slice
of heaven as much as we do.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.486
- You okay?
- Yeah.

07:03.487 --> 07:05.244
I'll be fine.
Just, just kids.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.486
Uh, I have a first-aid kit in the car.
I'll grab it.

07:07.487 --> 07:08.487
Thanks.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.204
Uh, seeing
as you're such a fine group,

07:10.680 --> 07:12.364
I feel it's my...

07:12.840 --> 07:14.524
...civic duty to warn ya.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.560
Be careful out there.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.844
Especially...

07:22.400 --> 07:24.129
...you go hiking in those woods?

07:24.920 --> 07:25.921
What's in the woods?

07:26.240 --> 07:27.401
Bad stuff.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.171
It's nothing we can't handle.

07:30.400 --> 07:31.401
I'm sure.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.809
Lyme Disease
is pretty bad in these parts.

07:35.720 --> 07:38.007
All I can say is check for ticks.

07:38.440 --> 07:39.726
Why? What happened?

07:40.240 --> 07:44.529
Few hikers
got real sick last week.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.610
Uh, doctors took care of 'em,

07:48.320 --> 07:50.482
I guess.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.323
What do you mean, uh,
what do you mean you guess?

07:56.324 --> 07:58.288
Hey, hey!
Hey, hey! Hey!

08:00.120 --> 08:01.120
What?

08:01.160 --> 08:02.885
You wanna give me
one good reason

08:02.886 --> 08:04.564
why you'd steal a Snicker's bar?

08:04.920 --> 08:05.726
Huh?

08:05.727 --> 08:07.967
Would you believe me
if I told you it was for the nougat?

08:08.440 --> 08:10.010
The nouga-what now?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.525
Never mind.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.961
Look, I'm sorry. Really.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.440
Seriously, I, sometimes I just
take things, I don't know why.

08:16.441 --> 08:17.441
Get the hell outta here!

08:17.442 --> 08:19.442
Yeah, okay.

08:19.960 --> 08:21.007
Goes for the rest of you, as well.

08:21.008 --> 08:24.083
Get outta here,
before I call the sheriff.

08:24.520 --> 08:28.639
What?
It was an accident.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.959
An accident?

10:02.480 --> 10:03.970
Hey, listen to this.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.682
"Welcome and enjoy your stay.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.088
Real remote mountain getaways.

10:09.760 --> 10:14.288
If you're looking for fun,
you've come to the wrong place."

10:15.120 --> 10:16.929
I think w... we'll have fun.

10:17.280 --> 10:20.039
Wow, this place is amazing.

10:20.040 --> 10:24.682
Your mom really hooked this up,
except, uh, I can't find the TV...

10:25.560 --> 10:26.721
You coming?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.644
I'm not getting any bars.

10:32.800 --> 10:33.801
Um...

10:34.360 --> 10:35.805
So no phone, and I'm...

10:35.806 --> 10:37.723
guessing no Internet there.

10:38.520 --> 10:40.679
Whoa, wa-wa-whoa-oh-oh.

10:40.680 --> 10:41.727
No internet?

10:42.160 --> 10:44.766
No weed.

10:45.160 --> 10:47.447
No GTA V, no Black Ops II,

10:47.600 --> 10:50.331
no Stimpy, no Minecraft, no...

10:50.640 --> 10:51.679
weed?

10:51.680 --> 10:53.091
You mentioned weed twice.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.248
Yeah, I know. On purpose.

10:55.400 --> 10:58.051
What, we're talking a whole week
here, there's no way.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.925
Dude, my clan needs me.

10:59.926 --> 11:02.685
Just think of this as gamer rehab,
you'll get over it.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.966
But I don't wanna go
to gamer rehab.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.171
You brought a gun?

11:43.320 --> 11:45.482
Okay, firstly, it's not a gun.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.285
It's a rifle.

11:47.840 --> 11:50.730
More specifically,
an assault... rifle.

11:51.720 --> 11:52.881
Second, we're in the woods,

11:52.882 --> 11:55.645
so... I thought I'd practice
my survival skills.

11:55.800 --> 11:57.564
Don't you think
that's a little overkill?

11:58.160 --> 11:59.525
No.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.043
Fully upgraded.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.204
Barely legal.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.569
I won't even go into the tech specs
on this beast

12:06.570 --> 12:07.839
'cause you couldn't handle it.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.203
You're gonna accidentally shoot
one of us.

12:09.204 --> 12:10.724
Never happen.
I have years of training.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.250
Video games don't count.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.205
Will you just be careful
with that thing?

12:15.206 --> 12:16.439
Okay, will you relax?

12:16.440 --> 12:17.885
I am perfectly responsible.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.319
Jesus, dude.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.687
My bad. My bad.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.400
Just keep that thing
away from me.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.170
Cool.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.891
Whoa! Oh!

13:14.480 --> 13:16.005
Epic.

13:22.920 --> 13:25.605
I'm about to go HAM
on some indigenous species.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.084
What happened to no signal?

13:57.840 --> 13:59.649
I can still post stuff.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.241
It'll upload,
it'll just take longer.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.449
You could just put that down
and enjoy this.

14:17.280 --> 14:18.770
So, Karen...

14:19.960 --> 14:22.247
...how long have we
known each other for?

14:22.520 --> 14:23.681
That's a weird question.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.928
What do you mean?

14:27.560 --> 14:29.210
I don't know,
I was just thinkin'.

14:29.920 --> 14:30.999
Just thinkin'?

14:32.920 --> 14:34.251
Um...

14:35.400 --> 14:37.562
...gosh, I don't know.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.566
4th grade?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.206
That's a long time.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.448
It's a long time.

14:46.640 --> 14:49.319
<i>I find it strange, find it strange</i>

14:49.320 --> 14:52.403
<i>That you're wandering in this place</i>

14:53.920 --> 14:55.285
We gonna go swimming?

14:55.640 --> 14:58.405
<i>I thought it'd change
Thought it'd change</i>

14:58.406 --> 15:02.239
<i>But the more it stays the same</i>

15:03.720 --> 15:04.846
I'll race you to the island!

15:05.040 --> 15:07.361
<i>Some things are made
Yeah, they're made</i>

15:07.362 --> 15:10.842
<i>To never separate</i>

15:14.120 --> 15:20.082
<i>Have I</i>

15:23.520 --> 15:25.363
<i>...cars... I need everything</i>

15:25.364 --> 15:27.328
<i>Those clothes
I need everything</i>

15:27.329 --> 15:29.399
<i>Flat kicks
I need everything</i>

15:29.400 --> 15:31.359
<i>Them hoes I need everything</i>

15:31.360 --> 15:33.359
<i>Yo bitch
I need everything</i>

15:33.360 --> 15:35.519
<i>That gold
I need everything</i>

15:35.520 --> 15:37.363
<i>That work
I need everything</i>

15:37.364 --> 15:39.442
<i>That dough
I need everything</i>

15:45.720 --> 15:47.802
You know Toby Brown?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.520
Yeah.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.402
Greasy Toby,
the guy with the OCD?

15:54.160 --> 15:57.642
Yeah. That and ADD.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.891
He tried to kiss me.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.119
He did?

16:05.120 --> 16:06.719
Mm-hm.

16:06.720 --> 16:08.051
Two days ago.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.131
It's weird, it's like...

16:10.720 --> 16:13.200
...this family friend
I've had for 12 years.

16:13.600 --> 16:18.079
Just... he put his hands on my face
and tongue down my throat,

16:18.080 --> 16:20.242
and it was, was gross,
it was just bad.

16:21.480 --> 16:26.566
What, was it... gross because
you'd known him for so long or...

16:27.080 --> 16:28.411
because he's gross?

16:28.640 --> 16:31.769
Mmm... it was definitely him.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.759
You know, like,

16:37.760 --> 16:41.162
sometimes you've known someone
a really long time,

16:41.400 --> 16:43.960
and you just wanna kiss 'em just
to see if they're a good kisser?

16:49.760 --> 16:50.760
Yeah.

16:53.880 --> 16:56.690
I don't think there's
anything wrong with that.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.364
Where are you going?

17:11.839 --> 17:13.523
Swimming.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.169
Thought we were kissing!

17:21.760 --> 17:23.285
We were.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.565
Oh, shit.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.361
Janny, I'm coming up
on your seven.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.085
Fraggo!

17:57.040 --> 17:58.121
Poof!

17:58.360 --> 17:59.280
Aah!

17:59.281 --> 18:01.248
I think I just got a team killed
to save you guys.

18:01.440 --> 18:02.566
It's all good, move it up!

18:07.720 --> 18:09.210
Ninja3609...

18:09.600 --> 18:11.602
...do you copy?

18:12.160 --> 18:13.160
Agent36?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.485
Shit, they got him.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.448
Shit, of course, now it's on.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.606
Whoo!

18:28.560 --> 18:29.799
God, that smells good.

18:30.723 --> 18:32.085
Aah!

18:33.680 --> 18:35.842
Oh, no! Oh, no.

18:40.920 --> 18:41.920
Oh, no.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.599
You shot me!

18:43.600 --> 18:44.959
No fucking way!

18:44.960 --> 18:46.086
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, man.

18:46.087 --> 18:47.366
I am so sorry!

18:50.160 --> 18:51.241
Help me!

18:51.720 --> 18:52.926
Okay, okay.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.764
Don't come near me, man, okay?
Stay back.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.291
- Help me!
- Okay, okay, stay back.

18:57.292 --> 18:58.566
Hey, stay back!

18:58.840 --> 19:00.285
I said, stay back!

19:02.120 --> 19:03.610
I said, stay back!

19:03.800 --> 19:05.882
I'll get you some help,
just stay there!

19:06.480 --> 19:07.641
Please!

19:10.520 --> 19:11.965
Holy shit.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.606
Fuck.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.168
Help me!

19:19.240 --> 19:21.242
Help me!

19:37.600 --> 19:38.886
Oh, my God.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.171
The... fuck?

19:53.040 --> 19:54.040
Bert.

19:54.400 --> 19:55.481
Hey.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.686
Bert, come here.
Come here.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.046
Holy shit.

20:00.240 --> 20:01.600
What are you doin'?

20:01.760 --> 20:03.760
What, were you trying
to burn the whole place down?

20:03.960 --> 20:05.928
What's wrong with you?

20:06.280 --> 20:08.089
What are you?
Smokey the Clown?

20:09.720 --> 20:11.290
You mean Smokey the Bear?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.279
Seriously, though,
how old are you?

20:13.280 --> 20:14.486
We can't leave you alone
for five minutes

20:14.487 --> 20:16.164
without you burning the place down?

20:16.760 --> 20:17.921
And he brought a gun.

20:18.320 --> 20:19.970
Great, so,
what were you shooting at?

20:21.440 --> 20:22.440
Squirrels.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.962
Shootin' some squirrels.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.409
- Okay.
- What is wrong with him?

20:29.720 --> 20:31.768
Video game
withdrawals maybe.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.048
What are you gonna roast
on that thing?

20:47.120 --> 20:48.406
Squirrel, if we can get one.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.601
I'm a vegetarian.

20:54.840 --> 20:56.604
So, Paul, tell your story.

20:57.760 --> 21:00.639
No, no, man, it's...

21:00.640 --> 21:02.927
It's too traumatic.
I don't want to talk about it.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.679
I like traumatic stories.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.524
I mean, not about me,
but... in general.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.131
Plus, trauma bonds people,

21:09.280 --> 21:11.122
so you can totally
talk to us about it.

21:11.123 --> 21:13.039
Trauma bonds the people
who experience it,

21:13.040 --> 21:14.216
not the people
that you tell the story...

21:14.240 --> 21:17.039
- Just tell the story!
- Fine. Fine.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.448
We used to go to this...

21:23.680 --> 21:25.523
bowling alley...

21:25.960 --> 21:28.167
Lenny Meads Brighton Bowl,
you remember it?

21:28.168 --> 21:30.208
It's in Brighton, right?

21:30.480 --> 21:32.767
Yeah, that's why it's called
"Brighton Bowl".

21:34.000 --> 21:35.599
Okay, guys.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.079
Anyway, every weekend
I would go there

21:38.080 --> 21:41.129
either with my dad or for a birthday
party or whatever.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.247
Well, one weekend I asked my dad
if we were going.

21:44.440 --> 21:46.886
He said, no.
He said the alley was closed.

21:48.640 --> 21:51.839
Apparently, some
disgruntled employee

21:51.840 --> 21:54.320
was holding all the other
employees at gunpoint.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.446
The police said
that he tied each hostage

21:58.447 --> 22:01.569
to a chair and arranged them
in a circle.

22:02.320 --> 22:05.449
That way everyone was forced
to look at one another.

22:06.400 --> 22:08.444
Then after that they've been
gagged and beaten,

22:08.445 --> 22:10.886
this maniac breaks out
a ball-peen hammer,

22:10.887 --> 22:13.451
and one by one...

22:14.760 --> 22:17.445
...smashes in the back
of their heads.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.609
Can you imagine dying like that?

22:22.960 --> 22:25.167
Just watching
all of your friends dying,

22:25.360 --> 22:26.599
knowing you're next?

22:26.600 --> 22:27.600
I can't.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.644
That's not all.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.201
This guy doesn't stop,
he breaks out the fire axe.

22:32.202 --> 22:34.407
The alarm sounds,
but he doesn't care.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.127
He hacks off all their limbs,
dismembers them completely.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.924
When the police arrived...

22:40.080 --> 22:42.439
they just found six bloody torsos

22:42.440 --> 22:45.444
tied to those colored
bowling chairs, remember?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.570
Blood everywhere.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.604
No sign of the killer, though.

22:50.200 --> 22:51.200
Poof.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.488
And that was your childhood
playground?

22:56.880 --> 22:58.405
Yeah.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.921
True story.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.685
Oh, my God, you were lying?

23:07.686 --> 23:09.444
No, it's true.
You can look it up.

23:09.680 --> 23:12.479
- You fuckers.
- It's not a funny story.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.925
It's Jeff's face
that's making me laugh.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.809
Oh, shit!

23:16.200 --> 23:17.725
Where the fuck
did you come from?

23:19.960 --> 23:22.361
- You spyin' on us?
- No, not at all.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.488
Just saw your campfire.

23:26.160 --> 23:30.163
I was out on a midnight hike,
I thought I'd come and say hello.

23:30.164 --> 23:32.204
I haven't seen anybody up here
in a week.

23:32.205 --> 23:33.770
Um, can you do something about...

23:33.771 --> 23:36.240
Dr. Mambo.
His name's Dr. Mambo.

23:36.960 --> 23:38.525
At least, that's what I call him.

23:38.526 --> 23:39.646
He seems to like it.

23:39.647 --> 23:42.484
Psychiatrist or pediatrician?

23:43.280 --> 23:44.850
Little of both, I guess.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.406
What are you doing out here?

23:47.320 --> 23:49.129
Same thing you guys are.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.762
Enjoying nature.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.891
Some of the best free climbing
is right here in this valley.

23:55.280 --> 23:56.805
Yeah, I hate heights.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.041
It's definitely not for everybody.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.647
So you don't mind if I sit here
and chill out with you guys

24:02.648 --> 24:03.919
for a bit, do you?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.725
Actually we're having
a... private conversation,

24:06.726 --> 24:07.846
so if you don't mind...

24:08.240 --> 24:11.050
No worries. I get it.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.639
I guess I'll just take
this big bag of weed

24:14.640 --> 24:16.085
and smoke it all by myself.

24:16.086 --> 24:17.959
- Oh, hey...
- No, no, no!

24:17.960 --> 24:19.041
- Sit down.
- Sit down. What are you...?

24:19.042 --> 24:21.719
- Are you sure?
- Hey, no...

24:21.720 --> 24:23.563
I'm so sorry.
What's your name?

24:23.840 --> 24:24.840
Connor.

24:25.560 --> 24:27.005
But you can call me Grim.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.959
Grim, like, uh, Grimace or...?

24:28.960 --> 24:29.961
No.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.647
Just Grim.

24:36.840 --> 24:38.808
Like Death...

24:38.960 --> 24:40.883
Like the Grim Reaper.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.839
I figure I'm gonna die
up in these mountains anyways,

24:44.840 --> 24:46.285
so...

24:47.360 --> 24:48.771
I don't know...

24:49.280 --> 24:52.250
Just a nickname.
I didn't pick it.

25:00.840 --> 25:03.207
I just came up here
from Berkeley.

25:04.760 --> 25:06.000
Now, that's a party town.

25:06.840 --> 25:10.447
- Karen was just there.
- Oh, yeah?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.722
Yeah.

25:13.120 --> 25:15.851
Oh, my gosh,
I met these guys in...

25:16.160 --> 25:17.764
They wouldn't let me drink
anything but beer

25:17.765 --> 25:20.206
for, like, five days, just solid.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.808
I've done that.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.725
I got drunk.

25:26.240 --> 25:28.129
Actually, sounds
like a pretty cool idea.

25:28.520 --> 25:31.364
- Only drinking beer.
- I could do it.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.484
I don't know if you could.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.206
If that is a challenge, sir,
then, I accept.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.121
All right, fine, from here on out,
we'll only drink beer.

25:39.520 --> 25:41.761
Deal.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.882
Looks like rain
is headed our way.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.082
It's gonna be a wet one.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.603
Yeah. Party's over.

25:55.920 --> 25:59.049
Why don't you, uh, come up
for a minute and hang out?

25:59.640 --> 26:02.722
That's cool, but, uh,
I gotta get back to my tent.

26:02.723 --> 26:03.959
I left all my gear out,

26:03.960 --> 26:07.601
and if it gets wet,
that's $4,000 destroyed.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.529
How far is your campsite?

26:10.760 --> 26:12.922
It's about 20 minutes,
give or take,

26:12.923 --> 26:14.959
but, uh, I can come back.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.200
Can you bring the weed?

26:16.640 --> 26:17.799
Absolutely.

26:18.924 --> 26:20.843
All right, Dr. Mambo.
Let's hit it.

26:27.080 --> 26:29.447
Huh?

26:29.600 --> 26:30.886
That was pretty weird.

26:31.040 --> 26:32.246
He was okay.

26:38.360 --> 26:39.691
So how did you do it?

26:42.200 --> 26:44.199
What do you mean, "how"?

26:44.200 --> 26:47.204
It... It was...

26:47.960 --> 26:51.362
Okay, I had different settings, like...

26:52.280 --> 26:55.090
pulse, power, stream,

26:56.080 --> 26:58.765
all different kinds of speeds,
and, uh...

26:59.360 --> 27:01.484
that was on this length of hose
that I could reach

27:01.485 --> 27:02.845
when I lay down in the tub.

27:05.160 --> 27:07.208
Wait, did you come every time?

27:09.200 --> 27:10.964
Absolutely.

27:11.440 --> 27:12.405
Yeah.

27:12.406 --> 27:14.406
Imagine my disappointment
the first time I had sex.

27:16.200 --> 27:17.964
Tell me about it.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.840
What's that supposed to mean?

27:20.920 --> 27:22.285
Wait, I have a better story
than that.

27:22.286 --> 27:23.964
Nah, bullshit, you do.

27:24.400 --> 27:26.924
Nothing beats stories about Karen
and her parents' shower massage.

27:26.925 --> 27:27.925
Thank you.

27:28.922 --> 27:31.439
Ah, it must be the weed guy.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.759
Okay. All right.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.844
<i>Oye, Grimace, we're comin '.</i>

27:36.845 --> 27:39.571
- It's Grim.
- Yup, whatever.

27:41.600 --> 27:44.251
- Help me. Help me, please.
- Oh, my God.

27:44.252 --> 27:45.685
I'm burnin'.

27:45.840 --> 27:47.410
Help me.

27:49.200 --> 27:50.690
I need a doctor.

27:50.920 --> 27:52.649
Uh, ge... get him a blanket.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.166
Oh, shit!

27:55.800 --> 27:57.768
You...

27:58.640 --> 28:00.079
It's you!

28:00.080 --> 28:01.519
No, no, no, no, no!

28:01.520 --> 28:04.479
No, no, no, no way...

28:04.480 --> 28:06.448
I'm letting
that contagious freak in.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.282
No, no, Bert, he's sick,
and he needs help, okay?

28:09.440 --> 28:11.522
What? No, look at him.

28:11.800 --> 28:13.961
I mean, he's got something.
He's got something bad.

28:13.962 --> 28:16.440
But we need to call him a doctor
or call someone.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.440
Okay, no, no, no,
we don't have any reception.

28:19.440 --> 28:22.125
Oh, shit.
That freak is going to the car.

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
What?

28:23.480 --> 28:24.561
Oh, wait, what?
What's he doing? What?

28:24.562 --> 28:27.404
<i>- Oh, fuck!
- Oh, my God.</i>

28:30.240 --> 28:31.999
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

28:32.000 --> 28:33.805
Hey! Get the fuck out!

28:33.806 --> 28:35.290
Hey, get the fuck out
of the car!

28:35.680 --> 28:36.966
Get the fuck out of the car!

28:36.967 --> 28:38.879
Hey! Hey! Hey!

28:40.880 --> 28:42.239
Oh, what the fuck!

28:42.240 --> 28:43.279
He's melting...

28:43.280 --> 28:44.600
Paul, come here and get him.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.839
- Paul!
- Hey, hey, hey.

28:51.323 --> 28:52.523
- Hey!
- Hey, freeze!

28:52.524 --> 28:54.601
Look at me!
Look at the guy with the gun!

28:54.602 --> 28:56.011
Hey, get out of the car!

28:56.440 --> 28:59.171
No! Shoot the crazy guy,
not the car!

28:59.480 --> 29:01.562
Jeff, do something!

29:02.480 --> 29:04.323
No, no, stay back!
Stay back!

29:06.640 --> 29:07.999
Get the fuck...!

29:10.960 --> 29:12.166
Go!

29:15.440 --> 29:16.680
Oh, my God!

29:18.400 --> 29:19.686
Help me.

29:54.760 --> 29:55.760
Look...

29:56.600 --> 29:58.762
What were we gonna do?

29:59.600 --> 30:01.319
I mean, this guy,
he gets in the car,

30:01.320 --> 30:02.845
he gets this shit
all over the inside of the car,

30:02.846 --> 30:05.119
he comes at us...

30:05.120 --> 30:07.487
I don't want him to touch me.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.848
I don't want him
to touch any of us.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.568
It was self-defense.

30:17.240 --> 30:21.928
And... it's raining,
so... it probably put him out.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.091
This is some serious real shit.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.211
Yeah, or worse.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.446
I mean, it looked like something
was eating his skin...

30:35.000 --> 30:37.367
...like biohazard style.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.199
Like quarantine.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.851
I think we should tell the police
it wasn't our fault.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.968
We should tell them... now.

30:47.320 --> 30:49.641
We have... we have to go
tell them right now. Please.

30:49.642 --> 30:53.167
That's where reality comes in.
We can't.

30:53.440 --> 30:56.171
I'm not about to ride in that car
with that dude's blood all over it.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.484
Come on.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.410
Tomorrow we can clean it up,
fix the tire,

31:05.000 --> 31:09.085
whatever else is wrong with it,
and report the accident.

31:09.840 --> 31:12.889
The keyword here is "accident".

31:14.640 --> 31:16.563
That guy's skin...

31:18.640 --> 31:20.563
Holy shit.

32:05.720 --> 32:07.051
What's the plan?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.841
Divide and conquer.

32:12.760 --> 32:14.091
You better leave me the rifle.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.763
He's right.

32:18.320 --> 32:19.685
What? Wait a second.

32:19.920 --> 32:22.161
I'm not the one
who went ballistic last night.

32:22.480 --> 32:23.640
What's that supposed to mean?

32:24.000 --> 32:24.728
It means...

32:24.920 --> 32:27.161
you raged out of control,
that's what.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.799
Well, that's fucked up.

32:28.800 --> 32:30.484
No, what's fucked up is you
beating the shit out of my car

32:30.485 --> 32:31.527
with your fuckin' bat.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.080
What about Captain Jack-off
over here with the assault rifle,

32:34.081 --> 32:35.047
you forget about him?

32:35.048 --> 32:37.281
All right, look,
we all fucked up the car.

32:37.282 --> 32:40.921
You guys just gonna keep arguing
or maybe do somethin' about it?

32:42.640 --> 32:45.120
- Where you going?
- To get help.

32:50.600 --> 32:52.682
She's right.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.088
I brought you some water.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.449
- Jeff and Bert have...
- I know.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.478
I know you know it.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.925
Look, last night, we...

34:15.926 --> 34:19.399
Paul, somebody came to our door
and asked for help,

34:19.400 --> 34:21.918
and we lit him on fire... okay?

34:21.920 --> 34:24.366
He could be anywhere out there,
and I just wanna go home.

34:24.367 --> 34:26.726
Karen, it wasn't our fault.

34:27.360 --> 34:29.201
We didn't mean to do it.
Everything happened so fast.

34:29.202 --> 34:30.201
It was an accident.

34:30.202 --> 34:31.326
Was it?

34:32.719 --> 34:36.327
I don't know about you,
but every time I close my eyes,

34:36.560 --> 34:39.163
I see him burning,
I can see him screaming,

34:39.164 --> 34:42.527
and his skin crackling,
and the smell of his burning hair.

34:43.120 --> 34:44.849
You saw him when he came
to the door last night.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.161
He was very sick.
He was going to die anyway.

34:47.161 --> 34:49.288
You don't know that.
Oh, my God.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.924
Look...

34:55.400 --> 34:57.721
Look, I can't change
what happened last night.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.202
I wish I could, but I can't.

35:02.600 --> 35:05.843
But if we just work together,
we can fix this.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.364
Okay?

35:11.560 --> 35:12.721
- Okay.
- All right, then.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.809
Better?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.809
Yeah.

35:28.840 --> 35:31.241
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:51.440 --> 35:52.851
I feel like we're gonna get lost.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.690
We're not gonna get lost.

36:13.760 --> 36:16.001
That place has gotta
have a phone.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.200
Uh, yeah...

36:19.440 --> 36:21.408
It looks kinda creepy.

36:21.840 --> 36:24.639
Don't be a wuss.
Let's go check it out.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.969
<i>Damn it!</i>

36:54.800 --> 36:57.201
Goddamn, rotten!

37:01.360 --> 37:02.959
You see this?

37:02.960 --> 37:04.724
You see this shit?

37:05.080 --> 37:08.971
This is the third sick hog
this month!

37:09.480 --> 37:12.563
You tell Marie I can't eat this!

37:13.080 --> 37:16.084
There's some goddamn animal
runnin' around here

37:16.240 --> 37:17.480
infecting everything!

37:17.880 --> 37:21.879
Now, what am I supposed
to do with a sick hog, huh?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.006
Huh?

37:23.200 --> 37:25.567
I'm not about to eat this meat!
Would you?

37:25.880 --> 37:29.168
N... no. No, I... I...
I'm a vegetarian.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.369
That has nothin' to do with it

37:31.560 --> 37:35.246
because you know
all this stuff is no good.

37:35.520 --> 37:39.047
It's all sick.
It all has to go back.

37:39.200 --> 37:42.090
I want me a new hog.

37:44.400 --> 37:46.919
Yeah, um, we just need
a mechanic,

37:46.920 --> 37:47.921
and we're just wondering...

37:47.922 --> 37:49.524
A mechanic?

37:50.560 --> 37:51.843
You're not gonna find one here.

37:51.844 --> 37:53.365
You got to go into town for that.

37:54.520 --> 37:55.839
Uh, yeah, right.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.079
But that... that's the, um...

37:57.080 --> 37:58.366
...the problem.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.959
Our car is busted,
so we can't... get into town.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.325
We need someone
to take us to town

38:03.480 --> 38:04.811
to get a mechanic.

38:05.400 --> 38:08.768
I already been in town
already today. Sorry.

38:11.320 --> 38:14.125
Uh, well, if you're going to town again,
can you let us know?

38:14.126 --> 38:16.771
We're just stayin' at a cabin
a few miles down the road.

38:21.480 --> 38:23.050
I'm sorry.

38:24.280 --> 38:26.965
Of course, of course.

38:27.320 --> 38:30.688
Heck, why didn't you just come
right out with it?

38:31.280 --> 38:34.045
Here I am,
prattlin' on about my hog,

38:34.200 --> 38:37.839
and you just wanna find somebody
who's gonna find you a mechanic.

38:38.800 --> 38:41.642
Come on up to the house.
I got a radio inside.

38:41.643 --> 38:44.007
We'll call Ricky.
Uh, he's got a tow truck.

38:44.960 --> 38:47.486
- That would be great.
- Yeah, great.

38:47.720 --> 38:49.961
Thank you. Ricky...

38:58.080 --> 39:00.970
Sorry to bother you,
but we really appreciate this.

39:01.520 --> 39:03.807
Some crazy guy came out
of the woods,

39:04.040 --> 39:07.328
just tryin' to trash our car
or break into it or somethin'.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.079
Sounds terrible.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.684
Uh, you two want
somethin' to drink?

39:10.920 --> 39:13.810
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes, please, thank you.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.489
Uh, you said this person
damaged your car?

39:17.840 --> 39:20.645
Yeah, it was this crazy hermit guy,
like, really dangerous.

39:20.646 --> 39:23.482
We just scared him off with bats
and everything.

39:23.483 --> 39:26.051
Crazy hermit guy?
I... It wasn't Henry, was it?

39:31.320 --> 39:33.679
- Um, Henry...
- Nah!

39:33.680 --> 39:37.207
Uh, my Cousin Henry.
Uh, he knows better than that.

39:37.640 --> 39:39.529
Did you say you hit him
with bats?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.439
- No.
- No.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.846
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

39:42.847 --> 39:44.205
What he means is, uh, no.

39:44.400 --> 39:46.719
It wasn't Henry.
It was our friend.

39:46.720 --> 39:47.605
Walter.

39:47.606 --> 39:48.806
It was Walter.
Our friend... Walter.

39:48.807 --> 39:51.087
This crazy friend Walter.
He's... He was drunk.

39:51.088 --> 39:52.650
Oh, that's not good.

39:52.800 --> 39:55.246
Uh, y... you know what?
Let's forget the tow truck.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.336
It's turning into such
a nice day. We'll just walk.

39:57.360 --> 39:59.010
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
we'll fix it ourselves.

39:59.011 --> 40:00.799
- Yeah.
- Are you sure?

40:00.800 --> 40:02.844
Yeah, absolutely.
Thank you so much.

40:02.845 --> 40:04.001
Thank you, really.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.571
Well, uh, suit yourselves, I... I...

40:09.160 --> 40:11.367
Now, I can't believe
we burned Cousin Henry.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.563
I know.

40:47.000 --> 40:49.526
Fuck.
Did you find anybody?

40:51.040 --> 40:54.249
Nothing. Nobody's home.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.160
Place is locked up pretty tight.

40:59.088 --> 41:01.003
Do you think the police
know about this yet?

41:01.280 --> 41:02.805
I doubt it.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.006
If they did, they'd be
at the cabin already.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.279
Whoa, whoa!
Easy, easy.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.124
Town boy, that's how people
get themselves shot around here.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.959
Deputy Winston, Bunyan County
Sheriff's Department.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.961
What can I do for ya?

41:42.320 --> 41:44.607
Eh, I'm just out here on patrol.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.206
It's my jurisdiction.

41:46.960 --> 41:50.079
I understand you guys had
a little commotion here last night.

41:50.080 --> 41:52.120
I was hopin' you could tell me
somethin' about that.

41:52.720 --> 41:54.324
Sure, sure. Uh, some...

41:55.000 --> 41:56.968
...guy tried to get
into our cabin.

41:56.969 --> 41:59.559
Uh, he was sick, really sick.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.005
I don't know what kind
of disease he had,

42:01.006 --> 42:02.809
but he was a mess, and...

42:05.280 --> 42:06.723
Yeah.

42:06.724 --> 42:08.484
I kinda have to report this.

42:09.800 --> 42:12.084
My friends are out lookin'
for a neighbor right now,

42:12.085 --> 42:13.159
so we could call you.

42:13.160 --> 42:14.241
We don't have a phone up here.

42:14.242 --> 42:17.767
No, most people got radios.
That's what I got.

42:21.000 --> 42:25.369
It looks like you guys were having
some kinda party last night, huh?

42:26.160 --> 42:27.965
Yeah, you know,
w... we were drinking,

42:27.966 --> 42:29.803
and then this guy came along
and tried to...

42:30.040 --> 42:32.319
He tried to break into our cabin,
and, you know,

42:32.320 --> 42:33.763
uh, we had no choice,
but to get rough with him.

42:33.764 --> 42:35.285
- And we didn't know what to do.
- Stop talkin'.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.327
Yes.

42:37.960 --> 42:40.084
Look, man, I already told you,
makin' a report.

42:40.085 --> 42:42.321
That guy's not gonna come back
and bother you.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.048
I'll bet you scared him off
pretty good, huh?

42:46.960 --> 42:48.166
Besides...

42:49.320 --> 42:51.800
I wouldn't let him ruin the fun.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.365
Thanks, 'cause...

42:59.440 --> 43:00.719
My friend's inside,

43:00.720 --> 43:02.480
and she's pretty upset
about the whole thing.

43:02.960 --> 43:05.008
She wants to go home.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.281
We all do.

43:07.120 --> 43:09.726
Hmm, lady friend, huh?

43:11.280 --> 43:13.681
I'll bet you like to party.

43:13.840 --> 43:16.650
I bet you like to party
with the ladies.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.968
Paul?

43:25.320 --> 43:27.561
Hey. Is everything okay?

43:28.080 --> 43:30.560
Oh, hey there, sugar.

43:30.720 --> 43:34.088
Oh, everything is, uh,
it's just fine.

43:34.600 --> 43:37.604
Why don't you take
your pretty little self back inside,

43:37.960 --> 43:42.409
just relax, put your feet up,
and, uh, pop open another 40.

43:42.960 --> 43:45.167
<i>- It's all good.
- Okay.</i>

43:45.760 --> 43:47.842
Okay, then.

43:55.440 --> 43:58.171
Shit.

43:59.680 --> 44:02.411
Now, that girl... is hot.

44:03.840 --> 44:06.650
If you're askin' me,
you gotta stay and party.

44:08.720 --> 44:11.485
Well, you know, that's why
we came here in the first place.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.446
Yeah, boy...

44:15.480 --> 44:19.166
...ain't this some kind
of wonderful... shit?

44:19.400 --> 44:23.359
I'd say that creep really did
a number on your Jeep here.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.360
Do you think you can get
someone up here to fix it?

44:25.800 --> 44:27.962
'Course. I'm not an idiot.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.639
I'll take care of you.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.722
I could probably have
someone here by, uh,

44:32.723 --> 44:35.087
I don't know,
tomorrow afternoon?

44:36.120 --> 44:39.647
I want you to know
you're in my top priority...

44:39.800 --> 44:41.768
...'cause you're my party man...

44:42.480 --> 44:44.528
...and this is party town.

44:45.040 --> 44:47.486
We are are gonna party, right?

44:49.440 --> 44:50.487
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

44:50.640 --> 44:51.801
Yeah.

44:52.080 --> 44:54.048
You know how to find me?

44:56.040 --> 44:58.042
Dial 910?

44:58.920 --> 45:00.649
That's right.

45:01.440 --> 45:03.681
Yeah, that's right.

45:04.400 --> 45:06.448
So take care of that little peach
in there.

45:07.160 --> 45:09.561
She sure looks sweet.

45:46.600 --> 45:47.886
This is bullshit.

45:52.400 --> 45:53.890
Oh, shit.

45:54.280 --> 45:57.011
So is she gonna report it
or not report it?

45:57.880 --> 45:59.609
I don't think she is.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.121
But she didn't make it sound
like we did anything wrong.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.722
She said she'll have a tow truck
up here by tomorrow.

46:05.560 --> 46:07.449
Sounds...

46:07.640 --> 46:09.290
...weird.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.806
It was.

46:12.960 --> 46:14.801
How's Karen? Has she
come out of her room yet?

46:14.802 --> 46:15.882
No, I think she's sleeping.

46:17.480 --> 46:19.164
Dude, I don't know
what's up with her,

46:19.960 --> 46:22.040
but she wants to get out of here
as soon as possible.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.406
Well, that kinda screws up
your plan, doesn't it?

46:26.800 --> 46:27.961
What plan?

46:28.520 --> 46:31.251
Uh, the plan you're being
trying to execute since...

46:31.800 --> 46:33.802
...what, eighth grade?

46:34.520 --> 46:36.568
There's no plan.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.408
Not anymore.

46:40.960 --> 46:41.960
All right.

46:42.200 --> 46:43.929
Well, she's a head case, anyway.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.930
All chicks are.

46:47.040 --> 46:48.087
What makes you say that?

46:48.600 --> 46:50.279
Look at her.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.009
I mean, you like her
'cause she's nice to you,

46:52.010 --> 46:54.401
and she likes you
'cause she can control you.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.211
Bert, don't move.

47:01.600 --> 47:04.171
Man, it's that freak's dog.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.086
Hey, pooch.

47:07.440 --> 47:08.646
Hey, Mister Tango.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.770
What the...?

47:12.120 --> 47:14.121
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't, don't piss it off.

47:14.122 --> 47:15.122
Should I hit it?

47:15.400 --> 47:17.846
If you hit it,
you better hit it hard.

47:32.920 --> 47:34.524
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

47:34.525 --> 47:36.204
I have two brothers.

47:37.360 --> 47:39.203
Also, you're not
the only gamer here.

47:39.480 --> 47:41.439
Whoa, cool!

47:41.440 --> 47:42.566
What the fuck?

47:42.720 --> 47:44.163
Did you see how messed up
that dog was?

47:44.164 --> 47:45.164
Yeah.

47:46.600 --> 47:48.170
So where's Grim?

47:50.000 --> 47:51.000
Thank you.

47:53.280 --> 47:54.805
I'll tell you where he is.

47:56.440 --> 47:59.523
He's out there rotting.

47:59.920 --> 48:02.685
There's some shit in that woods.

48:03.200 --> 48:05.248
And cousin Henry's
spreading it around.

48:05.440 --> 48:07.044
And I'm not waiting
for the deputy to get back.

48:07.045 --> 48:08.724
I say, we leave right now.

48:09.480 --> 48:10.925
Shouldn't we maybe mention
on the way out

48:10.926 --> 48:12.283
that we burned someone alive?

48:12.284 --> 48:13.441
<i>- Yes.
- No.</i>

48:13.442 --> 48:14.851
Jeff.

48:20.480 --> 48:21.480
Fine.

48:22.000 --> 48:23.199
Fuck it.

48:23.200 --> 48:25.726
We'll tell 'em some sick guy came by,
so we set him on fire.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.201
They'll figure it out.

48:27.680 --> 48:29.284
The deputy knows
something happened.

48:29.285 --> 48:31.399
We're the only outsiders here.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.129
They'll trace it back to us.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.130
I feel really nauseous.

48:44.720 --> 48:46.370
Karen.

48:53.360 --> 48:55.283
How soon can you
get us out of here?

49:09.480 --> 49:11.687
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:12.040 --> 49:13.530
Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.

49:13.531 --> 49:14.726
It's okay.

49:15.200 --> 49:16.919
Are you hungry?

49:16.920 --> 49:18.365
No.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.164
I'll let you get back to sleep.

49:22.800 --> 49:24.609
Don't go.

49:48.120 --> 49:50.296
I think it's smart we're doing this now
and not waiting.

49:50.320 --> 49:52.279
Yeah, I could fix
the tire pretty quickly,

49:52.280 --> 49:54.400
but I still have no idea
what's wrong with the engine.

49:55.600 --> 49:57.011
Well, hurry up.

49:57.440 --> 49:59.807
I can't listen
to Marcy whine for ano...

49:59.808 --> 50:01.599
<i>- Oh, shit!
- What?</i>

50:01.600 --> 50:02.886
Just don't move,
don't turn around,

50:02.887 --> 50:04.484
just keep doing
what you're doing.

50:04.640 --> 50:06.280
Can you hit it from here?

50:11.040 --> 50:12.040
Aw, fuck!

50:12.800 --> 50:13.879
It didn't even flinch.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.803
There's something seriously
wrong with this dog.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.803
- Just quick scope the fucker.
- What?

50:17.960 --> 50:19.485
Just shoot it.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.479
Just keep going.

50:24.480 --> 50:25.766
- Really?
- Yeah, just do it!

51:41.440 --> 51:43.839
Ow, ow, ow!

51:43.840 --> 51:45.842
Stop, stop, stop! Ow!

51:52.480 --> 51:54.482
Holy shit!

51:59.400 --> 52:01.971
Marcy! Jeff! Bert!

52:08.720 --> 52:09.960
Oh, my...

52:16.600 --> 52:18.045
Holy shit!

52:18.520 --> 52:19.851
Oh, my God!

52:21.400 --> 52:22.683
Oh, my God!
She's got it.

52:22.684 --> 52:23.920
No, please don't leave, Paul!

52:24.120 --> 52:26.120
No, no, no, Karen. Stay in bed.
Don't come near me.

52:26.320 --> 52:27.443
Calm down, take it easy.

52:27.444 --> 52:29.681
No, no, no, get out,
get out, get out.

52:29.682 --> 52:31.804
Bert, please, I'm bleeding! Bert!

52:31.805 --> 52:34.167
You stay in bed.
You're not going anywhere.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.002
- Dude, she's bleeding.
- No!

52:37.160 --> 52:39.839
I'm not letting you go!
It hurts!

52:39.840 --> 52:43.279
Karen, you got it, dude.
You're infected.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.439
Oh, shit!

52:44.440 --> 52:46.799
Please! Don't leave me! Paul!

52:46.800 --> 52:48.609
Just leave her alone,
goddamnit!

52:48.610 --> 52:51.524
Paul, don't leave!

52:52.160 --> 52:56.239
Paul, Paul, Paul.
She's sick, okay?

52:56.240 --> 52:57.844
I'm doing this for you.

52:57.845 --> 52:59.763
I'm doing this for all of you.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.243
I'm not dying like that.

53:01.244 --> 53:02.571
What do you mean, "dying"?

53:02.572 --> 53:05.439
Karen, Karen,
you stay in that bed!

53:05.440 --> 53:07.010
<i>Don't leave!</i>

53:09.560 --> 53:11.642
Marcy!

53:14.200 --> 53:15.319
Please.

53:15.320 --> 53:18.403
We're not gonna leave you.
The car is busted. Just...

53:18.840 --> 53:19.887
Ow!

53:20.480 --> 53:23.006
Stay in the bed
until we can get help, okay?

53:23.240 --> 53:24.730
<i>Please!</i>

53:25.080 --> 53:26.286
Please!

53:31.240 --> 53:32.240
Oh, shit.

53:43.400 --> 53:46.244
What the fuck is going on?

53:57.720 --> 53:59.404
We need to find her help.

53:59.600 --> 54:00.681
The sooner, the better.

54:00.682 --> 54:03.365
No, we have to move her first.

54:03.680 --> 54:04.886
Where?

54:06.200 --> 54:07.531
The boat shed.

54:08.200 --> 54:09.959
What? Come on!

54:09.960 --> 54:11.802
No, if she's infected
with whatever it is,

54:11.803 --> 54:13.165
we have to quarantine her.

54:13.320 --> 54:15.401
We have to get her away from us,
separate from us.

54:15.402 --> 54:16.890
Just let me go
and check up on her.

54:17.080 --> 54:18.879
Look, they're probably right, okay?

54:18.880 --> 54:19.879
She'll be safe out there.

54:19.880 --> 54:21.086
We can get her a mattress
and a light.

54:21.087 --> 54:22.969
- She'll be fine.
- I get it, but I don't...

54:23.800 --> 54:25.723
- Holy shit!
- Fuck!

54:28.320 --> 54:29.606
Don't bother.

55:20.200 --> 55:22.521
Ah, fuck you, guys!

55:23.600 --> 55:26.604
I'm sorry, Karen.
We just don't wanna get sick.

55:27.640 --> 55:29.085
I'm gonna die out here.

55:29.280 --> 55:31.726
You're not going to die.

55:31.727 --> 55:33.165
What about that dog?

55:33.480 --> 55:35.608
Hey, don't worry, I got this.
I'm gonna watch you.

55:36.120 --> 55:38.566
Somebody will be outside.
We're not gonna leave you.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.163
Are you hungry?
Can I bring you some food?

55:44.640 --> 55:46.759
I just wanted to go home.

55:46.760 --> 55:48.762
Hey, it's only one night.

55:49.600 --> 55:51.841
I'm gonna go to try to find help
in a cabin, you know,

55:51.842 --> 55:53.365
with a phone or something,
okay?

55:53.720 --> 55:55.245
You're gonna be just fine.

56:01.160 --> 56:02.525
Please, don't...

56:09.840 --> 56:11.166
I'll take first watch.

56:11.167 --> 56:12.204
I'm gonna go find help.

56:12.205 --> 56:13.440
Where are you gonna go?

56:13.720 --> 56:15.399
We checked this entire area
this morning.

56:15.400 --> 56:17.971
- There's no one around for mile...
- Well, I've got to do something.

56:17.972 --> 56:19.371
What about the dog, Paul?

56:19.640 --> 56:21.881
Screw the dog.
I'll take my chances.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.045
Hey, wait.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.211
We'll hold down the fort.

56:27.840 --> 56:30.002
This is so fucked up.

56:33.680 --> 56:35.250
Let's go.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.523
Come out here,
you fucking mutt!

57:12.160 --> 57:13.969
Where are you?

57:14.200 --> 57:15.440
Where you at?

57:16.640 --> 57:18.449
Where are you?

57:18.840 --> 57:20.171
Where are you?

57:20.840 --> 57:23.002
Oh! Oh! Come on!

57:27.920 --> 57:29.729
Come on, where are you?

57:51.160 --> 57:53.731
You got to eat something,
please.

58:06.120 --> 58:10.728
You let me know if I can get you
anything or do anything, okay?

58:16.280 --> 58:18.282
You better shut the door.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.721
I don't wanna infect everyone.

58:58.360 --> 58:59.766
What the hell are you doing?

58:59.767 --> 59:01.719
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Get off my land!

59:01.720 --> 59:02.607
I'm sorry.
You know what, you see,

59:02.608 --> 59:03.803
my... my friend, she's sick.

59:03.804 --> 59:05.279
She's very, very sick, and I...

59:05.280 --> 59:06.280
You're sick!

59:06.400 --> 59:08.199
Spying on our love making.

59:08.200 --> 59:09.536
No, no, no,
I'm... I'm sorry, I... I...

59:09.560 --> 59:11.050
That's my husband.

59:11.840 --> 59:14.366
Okay, but my...
Please, my friend, she's dying.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.096
We need a phone, like, right now.
We need help.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.885
- Get off my property!
- Bullshit!

59:32.240 --> 59:33.240
Hey!

59:33.880 --> 59:36.639
Oh... Jesus!

59:36.640 --> 59:37.926
Where you been?

59:38.560 --> 59:40.050
Did you find anybody?

59:40.400 --> 59:41.400
No.

59:43.240 --> 59:44.810
At least you tried.

59:46.200 --> 59:48.646
Come on, everybody's
waiting for you.

01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.120
Nobody's hungry?

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.922
Karen may have used those bowls.

01:00:14.923 --> 01:00:16.359
Jesus, Jeff! I washed them.

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.361
No, he's right.

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:21.368
I'm not eating anything
until we get to town.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.360
Now, anyone of you could have it.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.241
I... I know we checked,
but I'm not gonna risk it.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.725
- I'm not sleeping next to you.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:00:34.726 --> 01:00:36.051
I don't know what the fuck
you've been doing.

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:37.679
I don't watch you
24 hours a day.

01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:38.804
So, then,
go sleep in the car, please.

01:00:38.805 --> 01:00:39.767
Do us all a favor.

01:00:39.768 --> 01:00:41.489
The car is a fucking Petri dish.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:42.839
I'm not gonna ride in it.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.171
My mom will just
give me a new one.

01:00:44.172 --> 01:00:46.288
- Oh, my God.
- I cleaned it, it's fine.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.084
- Why don't you sleep in it?
- Maybe I will.

01:00:48.085 --> 01:00:49.570
All right.
You guys are right.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.679
We should all just
prepare our own meals

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.320
'cause I'm not cooking
for you guys again.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.925
Hey, you're all mine.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.163
- What the fuck is wrong with you?
- Hey!

01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.879
Sit down! Chill out!

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.451
I can't take this shit anymore.
I can't do this by myself.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:13.206
And I'd prefer if we didn't
fucking argue about everything!

01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.240
Bert, you just lost the bet.

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.680
What?

01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:24.010
Never mind.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.328
Karen is dying out there.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:32.686
And we're acting
like a bunch of fucking pricks.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.969
If we don't start working together,
we're all doomed.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.529
- He's right.
- Oh, of course, he's right.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.210
- I'm just saying...
- Not another word!

01:01:45.211 --> 01:01:47.851
I can't handle any more
of this shit!

01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:50.682
We can eat alone,
we can sleep alone.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.809
But we have to stick together.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:01.561
All right.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.285
I'm with ya.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.765
Good.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.882
Does anybody got
anything else to say?

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.725
What the hell is that?

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.483
Jesus Christ, look at it.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.811
He's going for Karen.

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.808
Bert, you got the gun.
Shoot that thing.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.560
What if I miss?

01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:38.401
I mean, wounded animals
are twice as dangerous.

01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.211
He's gone.

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:44.921
What...

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.601
We gotta make sure that thing
can't get to her.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.242
Where the hell did it go?

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.405
Holy shit.

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.330
Look at that.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.399
Hey, Karen.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.850
Karen?

01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.929
Hey. He's gone.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.602
I'm gonna keep
an eye on you, okay?

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.569
- Oh, my God.
- Holy shit.

01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.846
Oh, my God.

01:05:05.280 --> 01:05:07.203
Oh, my God.

01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:11.407
Fuck!

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.211
Yes, baby, come on, now. Yes.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:25.602
Yes. Yes!

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:28.446
Woo-hoo!

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.006
All right, let's go!

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.122
Come on, can you help us?
You gotta sit up!

01:05:32.123 --> 01:05:34.248
We're getting you
out of here, okay?

01:05:34.249 --> 01:05:37.199
- Oh, my God. Can you stand?
- No.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.168
- Come on. We got you.
- Okay.

01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.290
Jeff. Jeff.

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.082
We're leaving, let's go. Now.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.443
Come on. Come on.

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.599
Let's put her in the back.

01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:10.896
I'm not getting
in a car with her.

01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:12.285
Okay, then, put her in the front
with me, then.

01:06:12.286 --> 01:06:14.647
You okay?
Well, what is it?

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.559
Oh, my God.
She's dying.

01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.880
We need to get her to a hospital.

01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:21.610
- She's not gonna die.
- Okay. Come on, come on!

01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.680
- Let's go, let's go!
- What, are you fucking stupid?

01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:25.246
She's infected the whole car.

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:27.561
<i>- I'll take my chances.
- We're not leaving her.</i>

01:06:27.562 --> 01:06:29.721
Hey, Bert, are you okay?
You don't look so hot.

01:06:29.722 --> 01:06:31.324
Yeah, I... I don't feel so hot.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.440
The more we argue,
the more she rots, so let's go.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:36.410
Hey, how sick are you?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.684
That hermit guy touched you,
huh?

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.445
Well, did he or didn't he?

01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.371
Oh! Fuck this shit.
I'm getting help.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:46.806
Bert!

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.839
It's okay. Okay.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:18.006
Where are you going?

01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:20.679
Jeff? Jeff!

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.330
Hey, don't come near me.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:25.642
I told you not to move her
because I don't wanna get sick.

01:07:25.643 --> 01:07:27.199
I don't want
any of us to get sick,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:28.920
but you fucking idiots
insist on moving her,

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.411
and now you're covered
in her blood.

01:07:30.412 --> 01:07:32.528
So the two of you can fucking rot,
for all I care.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.159
All right, I'm fucking out.
That's it. I'm gone.

01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:37.527
You are a fucking asshole!

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:23.008
We're all gonna get it.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.880
We're all gonna get sick.

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.770
And Jeff's out in the woods
getting wasted.

01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:30.966
We're not gonna get it.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.207
Yes, we are.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.689
Bert will find help,
and Karen will be fine...

01:08:35.691 --> 01:08:37.408
- Paul...
- I promise.

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.131
It's like being on a plane
that you know is gonna crash.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:49.926
And everyone around you
is just... screaming,

01:08:49.926 --> 01:08:52.321
"We're going down.
We're going down."

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:59.201
And all you wanna do is just
grab the person next to you...

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.970
...and fuck the shit out of 'em.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:06.890
Because you know you'll both
be dead soon anyway.

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:09.124
Won't matter.

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.319
What the hell happened to you?

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.599
My friend, she's sick.

01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:48.090
You hold it,
you hold it right there now.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.760
I need a doctor, please.
She's really sick.

01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:51.609
You stop, all right?
You don't look too good.

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.039
Yeah, I know.

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.804
I just... I need a doctor, please.

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:56.651
Don't come any closer.

01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:58.323
I'll call you a doctor.

01:10:58.324 --> 01:10:59.523
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10:59.524 --> 01:11:00.885
Stay right there.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:09.241
Pancakes.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:11.679
Pancakes.

01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:13.091
No, no, no, no!

01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.159
Aah! Aah!

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:16.160
- Dennis!
- Ow!

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:18.204
What the fuck
is wrong with that kid?

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.888
- Oh...
- Oh, God. Why?

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.039
Why did you come here, huh?

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.929
Now look what you've gone
and done?

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.399
<i>- I'm sorry.
- My poor boy.</i>

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.004
<i>- What'd he done to you?
- Hey, hey, hey.</i>

01:11:28.005 --> 01:11:30.048
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- I already lost one boy!

01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:32.039
- I ain't losing another!
- Oh, fuck.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:33.929
Gettin' my boy sick
is the same as killin' 'em.

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:35.159
It's murder!

01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:37.719
Boy, you come in here,
you getting sick and all,

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.720
that was your problem.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.161
But now Dennis is sick,
that's my problem!

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.359
God Almighty.

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:46.970
No, we gotta
stop the problem.

01:11:46.971 --> 01:11:48.605
We're gonna stop
the problem right now.

01:11:48.606 --> 01:11:50.090
Fenster, get me the gun.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:54.008
Ho... hold on, hold on, okay,
I'm goin'. I'm goin'. I'm goin'!

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.490
I'm goin'!

01:11:55.491 --> 01:11:56.811
Oh, fuck!

01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:04.969
Them kids got disease.

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.961
They just gave it to Dennis.

01:12:06.962 --> 01:12:08.405
Well, take it easy, Tommy.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.605
When cattle gets sick...

01:12:11.606 --> 01:12:14.285
...you gotta kill it before it spreads
to the rest of the herd.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.807
Just like a dying dog.

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.729
We gotta put him down.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.962
We gotta put 'em all down.

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:26.123
Fenster, get in there
and call the sheriff.

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:28.851
Tell him we're having
big problems over that cabin.

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:31.719
Baily.

01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:34.405
Baily, get the truck.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:52.931
I brought you some water.

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.569
Karen?

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.839
- Yeah!
- Come on!

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:40.808
Get that boy!

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.170
What the fuck, you guys?!

01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.366
Jesus, Paul, you really did
a number on my back.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:03.486
I'm gonna find Jeff.
We're walking out of here.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.330
- What about Bert?
- We're not gonna wait for 'em.

01:14:05.331 --> 01:14:07.084
- Let's go.
- What about Karen?

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.325
Jeff!

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.164
Jeff!

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.846
Hey, Jeff!

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:52.239
Fuck!

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.921
No.

01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:25.170
Jeff!

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.966
Jeff!

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.000
It's in the water.

01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:05.408
It's in the water.

01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:07.004
It's in the fucking water.

01:18:07.005 --> 01:18:08.286
Don't drink the water!

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.684
It's in the water!

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.006
You missed.

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:34.045
Shut your pie hole.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.328
Geez. Jesus.

01:19:08.520 --> 01:19:09.567
Okay, okay, okay.

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.683
This way, boys.

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:37.609
I know exactly
where he's headed.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:45.400
Jeff!

01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.404
Jeff! Help me!

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.210
Come on!

01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:18.839
Come on! Fuckin' do it!

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:21.646
Go!

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.400
What?

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.200
Kill me.

01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:38.201
Kill me, please.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.046
I can't.

01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:44.405
Please! Please! Please!

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.245
Shoot me. Please.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.323
You gotta be fucking
kidding me!

01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:03.685
Please!

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.611
Please.

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:42.851
Try again.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.127
You kill me! Paul!

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.566
Please!

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.446
Kill me!

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.170
Bert!

01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:08.165
They, they're coming.
They're coming.

01:24:08.166 --> 01:24:09.207
They're gonna kill us.

01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:10.319
Who?

01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.482
The guy... the guys...
from the...

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:21.480
Bert.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.919
Wooh! Did you see that?

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:26.649
<i>- Goddamn bull's-eye.
- Uh-huh.</i>

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.725
No, you got the safety on.

01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:39.399
Thank you.

01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.725
No, no, no, no!

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.441
Can I get a fucking break here?

01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:39.165
Oh, shit.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:41.365
Oh, shit.

01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.844
Hey!

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:06.289
The tow truck?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.806
What happened to the tow truck,
Winston?

01:27:11.807 --> 01:27:13.802
You said you were gonna help us!

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:15.929
All right, just relax.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.964
Would you believe it,
the mechanic had car trouble?

01:27:17.965 --> 01:27:20.884
I had to send a tow truck
to get his fucking tow truck.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.524
Man, you're not looking so good.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800
No?

01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:26.759
I don't look so good?

01:27:26.760 --> 01:27:27.999
Need some help?

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.480
Yeah, a ride would be good.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:33.041
- Will you give me a ride?
- All right.

01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.170
Take it fucking easy, all right?

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:39.166
A ride? Sure.

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.090
I'll get you a ride.

01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:43.681
<i>Winston, Winston,
you copy?</i>

01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.725
I copy, Sheriff. Go ahead.

01:27:45.726 --> 01:27:47.119
<i>Some kids are up in the cabin,</i>

01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:48.724
<i>apparently on some type
of killing spree.</i>

01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:50.682
<i>Probably three casualties.</i>

01:27:50.683 --> 01:27:52.565
<i>They're armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

01:27:52.566 --> 01:27:54.759
<i>I repeat, do not go
anywhere near them.</i>

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:55.807
<i>They have some kind
of skin disease</i>

01:27:55.808 --> 01:27:57.479
<i>that'll eat you alive.</i>

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:00.479
<i>So if you see them, don't hesitate
to shoot them on sight.</i>

01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:01.480
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.604
Say that last part again.

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:08.202
<i>I said, if you see the kids,
shoot them on sight.</i>

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:12.325
Copy that.

01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:14.491
You give me that ride, Winston.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.205
What are you fucking nuts?
Shoot him.

01:28:16.206 --> 01:28:17.690
Shut up and back off.

01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.123
I need that ride, Winston.

01:28:19.124 --> 01:28:21.646
- Stay back.
- Oh, Jesus. You did this?

01:28:21.647 --> 01:28:22.879
Stay back.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:24.679
Fuck you! You did this!

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.966
Stay back.

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.729
Great party, Winston.

01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:43.559
One more step, I will kill you.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.528
You don't have to do that.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.284
You heard the sheriff.

01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.250
No one else has to die.

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.119
No one else has to
fucking die right now!

01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.885
You wanna fucking kill me?
Then, fucking kill everyone!

01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.922
No one else has to die!

01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.089
We're gonna make a deal.

01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:09.806
This is what's gonna fucking
happen, you bitch.

01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.407
You're gonna go look for me
at the cabin...

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.280
...and I'm gonna go look
for a doctor.

01:29:18.440 --> 01:29:20.204
Please!

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:25.969
Oh, goddammit, party man.

01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:27.440
All right.

01:29:28.440 --> 01:29:30.124
I'm not gonna kill you.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.326
Take that path.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.766
It's a shortcut.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.525
Takes you straight
to the main road.

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:38.248
Thank you, Winston.

01:29:38.480 --> 01:29:40.528
Thank you.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.366
Don't touch anything at the cabin.

01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:46.486
It's all infected.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.601
No.

01:30:14.080 --> 01:30:15.519
There's no road.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:17.568
Where is it?

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:19.445
The road, Winston.

01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:21.525
There's no fucking road.

01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:27.482
