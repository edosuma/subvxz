Replicants

00:05.860 --> 00:13.822
are bioengineered humans,design by Tyrell corporation for use off-world.Their enhanced strength made them ideal slave labor

00:14.320 --> 00:22.780
After a serious of violent rebellions,their manufacture became prohibited and Tyrell corp went bankrupt

00:23.278 --> 00:30.425
The collapse of ecosystems in the mid 2020s
led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace.

00:30.426 --> 00:34.226
Whose mastery of synthetic
farming averted famine

00:34.724 --> 00:42.188
Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell corp
and created a new line of replicants who obey.

00:42.686 --> 00:49.653
many older model replicants-NEXUS 8s. with open-ended
lifespans-Survived.They are hunted down and "Retired"

00:50.151 --> 00:53.137
those that hunt
them still go by the name...

if im taking you in the dirty.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.462
I was carefully not to.

05:03.855 --> 05:05.447
drag me in to the dirt.

05:07.438 --> 05:08.931
i dont want to the dirt...

05:10.225 --> 05:11.419
do you have a warrant
or an announced trespasses

05:15.301 --> 05:16.396
Are you a police?

05:18.486 --> 05:22.865
Are you Sapper Morton, id NK68514?

05:23.164 --> 05:24.358
I'm a farmer.

05:25.354 --> 05:26.349
a farmer.

05:27.444 --> 05:28.837
Why are you following me?

05:36.402 --> 05:37.795
This is the protein state.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.283
Designed by Wallace.

05:42.473 --> 05:43.767
Do I smell it?

05:44.862 --> 05:46.255
I grow up by myself.

05:47.449 --> 05:49.739
Garlic.
- I see.

05:50.734 --> 05:52.227
Just taste it.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.715
No thanks.

05:56.905 --> 06:00.687
The hard work works
better with the empty stomach.

06:03.773 --> 06:05.166
How long have
you been here?

06:05.564 --> 06:07.157
Since 2020.

06:08.351 --> 06:10.640
But you have
done more, is not it?

06:12.830 --> 06:14.124
Your bags.

06:14.721 --> 06:16.612
Settlement Medical Service.

06:16.911 --> 06:18.603
Military equipment.

06:20.991 --> 06:24.077
Where were you?
Callantha?

06:28.158 --> 06:29.551
Certainly brutal.

06:30.347 --> 06:32.039
Why dont you take me in?

06:33.632 --> 06:34.627
And...

06:35.324 --> 06:37.016
take a look inside?

06:37.414 --> 06:38.509
Mr. Morton,

06:39.902 --> 06:41.992
if it is...

06:46.471 --> 06:48.960
it is a better option.

06:50.552 --> 06:52.941
Someone, however,
would come in time.

06:55.529 --> 06:57.420
I got to the point.

07:01.202 --> 07:02.396
Whatever.

07:05.979 --> 07:06.975
Now...

07:07.771 --> 07:09.363
Could you

07:10.359 --> 07:12.847
look up to the left.

08:09.878 --> 08:11.072
Do not rise.

08:22.618 --> 08:26.002
How do you feel
like killing yourself?

08:29.685 --> 08:32.472
I do not delete my own
because we do not escape.

08:34.860 --> 08:36.602
Fault of old models.

08:36.702 --> 08:41.429
And the new designs
clean the shit out.

08:45.908 --> 08:47.899
Because you have
not seen a miracle.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.195
Describe all.

09:43.138 --> 09:44.631
Miss Commissar.

09:45.229 --> 09:47.617
<i>Opening a police message.</i>

09:51.001 --> 09:52.096
<i>You're hurt.</i>

09:52.395 --> 09:53.589
<i>I will not pay it.</i>

09:54.784 --> 09:56.575
To dip it.
<i>- I?</i>

10:02.945 --> 10:07.026
<i>Latest Nexus 8s.
You could tear your head off.</i>

10:07.723 --> 10:08.519
Tried.

10:08.618 --> 10:10.509
<i>It disappeared after Kalanthia.</i>

10:11.007 --> 10:13.495
<i>With a few others
that could be decided.</i>

10:14.590 --> 10:16.481
<i>One Only?</i>
- Just one.

10:17.377 --> 10:18.970
<i>Get in control.</i>

10:23.349 --> 10:24.444
Momentarily, ma'am.

11:12.617 --> 11:14.707
From 30 meters to maximum depth.

11:30.532 --> 11:31.627
<i>What is it?</i>

11:37.400 --> 11:38.594
<i>I'm sending a digging group.</i>

11:40.187 --> 11:41.580
<i>Come before the storm.</i>

12:59.314 --> 13:02.897
<i>Constable KD6-3.7, will be started.</i>

13:02.996 --> 13:04.688
<i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.

13:06.181 --> 13:07.674
<i>A statement for your test bed.</i>

13:07.873 --> 13:10.660
And there was
bloodshed emptiness

13:12.750 --> 13:14.641
Kennosto if there is another commonness

13:14.741 --> 13:17.130
around the cells to the third

13:17.229 --> 13:18.623
to related

13:18.722 --> 13:20.116
Pain in the fuck, imitation leather.

13:22.007 --> 13:23.301
Too bad in contrast

13:23.400 --> 13:26.585
night against the white fountain

13:28.078 --> 13:29.272
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

13:29.372 --> 13:31.064
<i>Have you ever
been in the facility?</i>

13:31.164 --> 13:32.358
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

13:32.457 --> 13:33.652
<i>Are you considered a trainer?</i>

13:33.751 --> 13:34.946
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

13:35.045 --> 13:37.832
<i>Are you locked in free?</i>

13:37.932 --> 13:38.927
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.818
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:40.918 --> 13:42.659
<i>How do you feel like
holding your beloved hand?</i>

13:42.759 --> 13:44.152
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:44.252 --> 13:45.994
<i>Did you know
about your fingers?</i>

13:46.093 --> 13:47.387
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:47.487 --> 13:49.079
<i>Do you want to contact our heart?</i>

13:49.179 --> 13:50.473
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:50.572 --> 13:52.264
<i>Do you dream
about the connection?</i>

13:52.364 --> 13:53.060
Together.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.852
<i>How does it feel to
keep her baby in her lap?</i>

13:54.951 --> 13:56.096
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:56.196 --> 13:57.838
<i>Is anything missing from you?</i>

13:57.937 --> 13:59.032
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

13:59.132 --> 14:01.720
<i>Together with the cell.</i>
- In one of the cellars.

14:01.819 --> 14:04.108
<i>Say three times "in one cell".</i>

14:04.208 --> 14:09.383
In one of the cellars, together
with the cell, together with the cell.

14:12.170 --> 14:13.365
<i>Prepare.</i>

14:15.057 --> 14:16.351
<i>Konstantti K.</i>

14:17.246 --> 14:18.839
<i>Your reward can be picked up.</i>

14:20.431 --> 14:21.427
Thank you.

14:22.024 --> 14:23.815
<i>Watch out. Watch out.</i>

14:25.010 --> 14:26.801
<i>Watch out. Watch out.</i>

14:30.185 --> 14:33.768
<i>Connecting to the outside
world at anytime from anywhere.</i>

14:33.868 --> 14:36.257
<i>Speech packages

14:36.356 --> 14:37.750
<i>Versatile additional services.</i>

14:42.826 --> 14:45.712
<i>You can leave
wherever you want.</i>

14:57.059 --> 14:59.845
What is a Korean tin soldier?

14:59.945 --> 15:03.727
Kyy walks home, right?

15:03.827 --> 15:05.220
Who's waiting for you?

15:05.320 --> 15:07.609
I'll knock you on your ass!

15:18.060 --> 15:19.801
PAIN BIRTH, COFFEE

15:33.786 --> 15:37.269
K, I did not hear you.
You came early.

15:37.369 --> 15:38.961
Will I come again?

15:39.558 --> 15:41.449
Go to laundry.
- Yes ma'am.

15:43.639 --> 15:44.933
How did the meeting go?

15:47.023 --> 15:48.417
Usually.

15:49.312 --> 15:50.407
How was your day?

15:50.507 --> 15:51.502
Oh...

15:52.298 --> 15:53.891
I'll go crazy inside.

15:55.085 --> 15:58.370
<i>99.9% sterile water.</i>

16:01.953 --> 16:03.844
There was a damage at work.

16:04.740 --> 16:06.332
The shirt should go to ruin.

16:07.128 --> 16:10.313
Give me, so I'll fix it.

16:16.982 --> 16:18.276
I need a spade.

16:19.570 --> 16:20.764
Do you want to spit first?

16:20.963 --> 16:22.755
Mm-hmm. Pour for me.

16:24.845 --> 16:28.229
I need exercise
with a new recipe.

16:28.627 --> 16:30.219
Do not waste your time.

16:32.708 --> 16:34.698
You should have marinate longer.

16:35.096 --> 16:36.689
Hope it did not come dry.

16:39.277 --> 16:43.656
Did you know that Reprise Records
released this song in 1966?

16:44.353 --> 16:46.144
It became a lynchpin.

16:51.718 --> 16:55.102
Not for long. Final order only.

16:59.581 --> 17:03.463
Now is ready. Hope to taste.

17:03.562 --> 17:05.553
In vain stress.

17:07.244 --> 17:08.539
Still.

17:11.525 --> 17:14.012
VoilÃ . Bon appÃ©tit.

17:16.999 --> 17:18.492
I was sorry, darling.

17:20.881 --> 17:22.473
Muru, look good.

17:23.069 --> 17:24.464
Raise your feet up.

17:25.559 --> 17:26.952
Relax.

17:45.266 --> 17:46.858
What day, huh?

17:48.550 --> 17:49.844
What day.

17:51.138 --> 17:52.332
Would you read to me?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.816
Cheer up.

17:56.314 --> 17:57.408
You hate that.

17:57.508 --> 17:58.802
I do not want to.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.285
Let's Dance.

18:02.385 --> 18:04.774
Do you want to
dance or open your gift?

18:05.072 --> 18:06.267
What a gift?

18:10.547 --> 18:11.542
This.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.234
What a glory?

18:13.732 --> 18:15.224
It is said...

18:16.021 --> 18:17.215
that is our wedding day.

18:17.713 --> 18:18.708
Is it?

18:20.301 --> 18:21.694
No but...

18:22.988 --> 18:24.182
is said to be.

18:25.476 --> 18:26.471
Is that okay?

18:30.453 --> 18:31.647
Happy Anniversary.

18:33.240 --> 18:34.633
Radiator.

18:39.112 --> 18:41.600
CONNECT THE RADIATOR

19:17.431 --> 19:18.427
Thank you.

19:18.725 --> 19:22.408
Gold, now you can
go wherever you want.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.394
Where do you want first?

21:39.263 --> 21:41.253
I'm so happy with you.

21:43.941 --> 21:45.235
No need to say that.

22:06.733 --> 22:08.127
VOICE MESSAGE

22:17.084 --> 22:20.070
<i>We got a lead on excavation.</i>

22:20.468 --> 22:21.563
<i>Come here.</i>

22:35.597 --> 22:39.479
<i>Carbon value 14.6 GPH.</i>

22:59.584 --> 23:03.864
The box is from the
army to Sapper Morton.

23:04.362 --> 23:08.343
It has been
creatively used as an urge.

23:09.239 --> 23:10.831
Only bones and hair.

23:12.424 --> 23:16.305
The samples show that the
woman had been buried for 30 years.

23:17.301 --> 23:21.282
The skeleton has been dismantled, the bones are
cleansed and the entire care is carefully buried.

23:21.580 --> 23:22.775
Woman?

23:24.268 --> 23:25.761
The cause of death, Coco?

23:36.709 --> 23:40.193
No fractures, no injuries except...

23:41.088 --> 23:43.179
Innominate.

23:44.373 --> 23:47.160
The baby got stuck in
the narrow breeding channel.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.653
Was she pregnant?

23:49.051 --> 23:50.146
Mm-hmm.

23:50.444 --> 23:51.639
So he was not killed?

23:51.838 --> 23:53.629
She died for her childbirth.

23:55.918 --> 23:56.914
What is that?

23:58.506 --> 23:59.502
Back.

24:00.795 --> 24:01.791
Getting closer.

24:03.582 --> 24:04.578
Yet.

24:07.862 --> 24:08.857
That.

24:11.246 --> 24:12.242
Duh.

24:12.640 --> 24:16.024
Tracks in the
bowel of the bowel.

24:16.422 --> 24:19.507
A thin knife, like a scalpel.

24:20.801 --> 24:22.991
Looks like an emergency section.

24:23.887 --> 24:26.972
The cuts are clean,
not defense damage.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.460
He was a doctor.

24:30.953 --> 24:32.944
Maybe saving was a business.

24:33.043 --> 24:34.935
He did not look like a rescue guy.

24:35.233 --> 24:37.423
He saw the trouble
of burying a woman.

24:37.622 --> 24:39.413
Sensitive skirt.

24:41.902 --> 24:42.897
Sorry.

24:43.693 --> 24:45.385
Where is the child?

24:46.878 --> 24:48.172
Did you look at the whole area?

24:48.272 --> 24:51.357
Only land and
worms, no other corpses.

24:51.457 --> 24:52.850
Maybe he was hungry.

25:41.720 --> 25:43.611
Out.

25:46.099 --> 25:47.592
He was a replicant.

25:50.578 --> 25:51.573
Pregnant.

26:01.228 --> 26:06.005
The world is on a wall that
separates half of each other.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.484
Without the wall begins war.

26:11.380 --> 26:12.475
Or slaughter.

26:16.854 --> 26:18.447
So what you saw,

26:20.835 --> 26:22.428
did not happen.

26:24.418 --> 26:25.414
Yes ma'am.

26:25.911 --> 26:28.798
My job is to maintain order.

26:28.897 --> 26:31.386
We maintain order.

26:33.575 --> 26:34.869
Delete this?

26:36.760 --> 26:38.353
Delete all.

26:38.452 --> 26:40.841
Baby?
- I tracked it.

26:45.419 --> 26:46.813
Was there anything else?

26:49.301 --> 26:51.789
I have not deleted the birth.

26:53.282 --> 26:54.278
So what?

26:59.155 --> 27:01.245
The born ones have a soul.

27:02.738 --> 27:04.231
Do you refuse?

27:05.525 --> 27:07.217
I did not know I could, ma'am.

27:08.112 --> 27:09.108
There you go.

27:12.790 --> 27:13.786
Hey.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.174
You did it without me.

27:16.871 --> 27:17.866
Without what, ma'am.

27:18.762 --> 27:19.758
The soul.

28:06.836 --> 28:11.414
<i>And the new
designs clean the shit out.</i>

28:13.902 --> 28:15.893
<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

28:32.813 --> 28:38.785
Wallace Headquarters

28:40.278 --> 28:42.269
I'm checking
the old serial number.

28:47.743 --> 28:49.236
DNA verification?

28:50.629 --> 28:51.724
Hair.

29:09.241 --> 29:10.237
Oops.

29:11.033 --> 29:12.128
Old.

29:13.322 --> 29:14.616
Parent older.

29:16.308 --> 29:18.100
It will be difficult.

29:19.493 --> 29:22.579
And so little is left,
what is left is...

29:23.673 --> 29:25.067
clumped.

29:26.261 --> 29:28.550
Customize your mind.

29:29.546 --> 29:31.536
As human as you want.

29:32.432 --> 29:35.518
But since it is a drilling site,

29:36.015 --> 29:39.997
I would not waste your money
on intelligence, affection or charm.

29:41.091 --> 29:43.978
Gun models are a matter of fact.

29:58.012 --> 30:00.400
Will we go on later.

30:03.685 --> 30:06.870
Everyone remembers
where they were at the break.

30:07.069 --> 30:08.612
Just before the time.

30:09.657 --> 30:13.041
I was at home with my parents.
And then ten days of darkness.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.633
The machines went to the place.

30:14.733 --> 30:17.221
When the lights came on,
the memories were empty.

30:17.321 --> 30:20.804
Images, files that bit out.

30:21.202 --> 30:24.089
We did not send bank squares.

30:24.188 --> 30:26.179
It feels so good that there is only paper.

30:26.278 --> 30:29.264
Everything was on
record, just about everything.

30:31.553 --> 30:34.241
Mom still cries after baby pictures.

30:34.738 --> 30:36.231
It's a pity it is.

30:36.829 --> 30:38.222
Lose sweet pictures.

30:44.293 --> 30:46.682
Time from shards, not much.

30:47.976 --> 30:50.166
Last models before the ban.

30:50.763 --> 30:54.147
Tyrell's standard set.

30:54.645 --> 30:55.640
And?

30:56.436 --> 30:59.124
Ordinary.
- Ordinary?

30:59.721 --> 31:01.612
There may be more.

31:09.972 --> 31:12.063
The old serial
number returns home.

31:14.053 --> 31:16.541
30 year old thing managed.

31:17.537 --> 31:18.532
Thank you, Constable.

31:20.324 --> 31:22.016
I'm Mr. Wallace's representative Luv.

31:24.802 --> 31:25.997
She gave me the name.

31:27.092 --> 31:28.485
Really.

31:29.580 --> 31:31.969
I represent Wallace. This way.

31:38.836 --> 31:41.922
The old models spoiled
the company's reputation.

31:43.614 --> 31:47.894
What a gift Mr. Wallace to the world.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.861
He rescued the foreign lands
when he bought Tyrell.

31:55.159 --> 31:56.851
Beware of technology.

31:58.145 --> 31:59.837
And that is not
what we have yet.

32:10.388 --> 32:14.269
You are also a customer.
Are you satisfied?

32:15.464 --> 32:18.748
Very realistic. Thank you.

32:19.943 --> 32:22.232
The trash are preserved here.

32:22.729 --> 32:25.218
For your luck, Mr Wallace
is a computer program.

32:38.057 --> 32:39.650
No one has ever been here.

32:43.133 --> 32:44.129
I apologize.

32:56.172 --> 33:00.053
All our memories of that time
were destroyed in a break.

33:01.248 --> 33:03.039
But there are snippets.

33:19.761 --> 33:22.448
<i>Your son collects butterflies.
He'll show you his collection</i>

33:22.647 --> 33:24.936
<i>as well as the slaughter.
- I took the doctor.</i>

33:27.424 --> 33:29.714
<i>... with your wasp hand.</i>

33:29.813 --> 33:30.908
<i>I would kill him.</i>

33:33.496 --> 33:36.880
<i>You can find a nudity picture
of a girl's full page in a magazine.</i>

33:37.577 --> 33:40.463
<i>Is this a replicating or
lesbian test, Mr Deckard?</i>

33:40.562 --> 33:42.354
<i>Please reply only.</i>

33:46.534 --> 33:48.326
He was not sure about him.

33:48.724 --> 33:51.312
Or someone was not there.

33:52.506 --> 33:54.298
It was difficult to identify us then.

33:56.388 --> 33:58.777
Is anything special about her?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.763
You started a formal investigation.

34:04.748 --> 34:07.237
Old serial numbers
are aroused by feelings.

34:08.431 --> 34:11.217
Everyone sleeps better
when they are aware of them.

34:14.702 --> 34:15.697
The woman likes her.

34:17.487 --> 34:18.484
Who?

34:19.179 --> 34:21.170
This is Constable Deckard.

34:22.764 --> 34:24.157
He is trying to irritate.

34:28.138 --> 34:31.123
Personal questions stimulate.

34:31.821 --> 34:33.114
Get to know...

34:34.706 --> 34:36.101
do not want to.

34:37.494 --> 34:39.087
Do you keep your job, constable?

34:44.063 --> 34:46.054
I thank Mr Wallace for your time.

34:58.694 --> 35:01.979
You knew Constable Deckard.

35:03.173 --> 35:04.467
What can you tell him about?

35:05.661 --> 35:07.453
Lonely wolf.

35:08.846 --> 35:09.941
Like me.

35:12.628 --> 35:15.415
Together, we were acting alone.

35:17.008 --> 35:18.003
That's it.

35:19.596 --> 35:21.387
Can you tell me anything else?

35:23.477 --> 35:25.866
She was not meant to be here.

35:28.056 --> 35:29.051
Why not?

35:31.838 --> 35:33.829
Something in his eyes.

35:37.213 --> 35:39.303
Could he contact him?

35:39.999 --> 35:40.995
No.

35:42.886 --> 35:44.777
She is <i> retired </i>.

35:48.161 --> 35:49.256
Retired.

35:51.246 --> 35:52.242
What happened?

35:52.640 --> 35:54.730
I guess I want it.

35:57.318 --> 35:58.711
Be alone.

36:23.992 --> 36:25.585
Welcome back, Mr Wallace.

36:27.277 --> 36:30.063
Are you looking for a
new model to be delivered?

36:31.955 --> 36:36.035
An angel should not come
to the Kingdom of Heaven

36:36.832 --> 36:38.026
without a gift.

36:40.912 --> 36:43.998
Can you even say "Child is born"?

36:55.145 --> 36:56.439
New model...

37:04.402 --> 37:06.392
We'll see.

37:54.963 --> 37:58.148
First

38:00.039 --> 38:01.632
feared

38:03.523 --> 38:05.115
from the clay front.

38:08.101 --> 38:09.594
Think.

38:10.988 --> 38:13.576
Before we even
know who we are,

38:15.865 --> 38:17.557
we are afraid to lose it.

38:19.348 --> 38:20.543
Happy Birthday.

38:30.396 --> 38:31.989
Let's see you now.

39:23.546 --> 39:25.238
We make angels

39:27.029 --> 39:29.717
for humanity.

39:31.309 --> 39:36.684
There were bad
angels, but I do good.

39:36.883 --> 39:41.163
And I took us
to nine new worlds.

39:44.049 --> 39:45.144
The nine...

39:47.134 --> 39:50.618
The child can count
nine with their fingers.

39:50.718 --> 39:53.504
The stars should be ours!

39:53.604 --> 39:54.599
Yes, Mr Wallace.

39:57.983 --> 40:02.860
Humanity has come up
with a sacrificial labor force.

40:02.960 --> 40:08.036
There is no return to Orjs,
except for biotechnology.

40:11.619 --> 40:13.510
But production has its limits.

40:19.482 --> 40:21.473
Karu pasture.

40:22.667 --> 40:25.952
Empty and dry.

40:27.843 --> 40:28.937
This here.

40:31.426 --> 40:34.412
Emptiness on the road to the stars.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.388
Does this have to
change for heaven's sake?

40:44.962 --> 40:46.853
They do not add,

40:46.953 --> 40:49.341
no matter how I tried.

40:50.237 --> 40:53.223
We need more than we can do.

40:53.322 --> 40:56.806
Millions and millions of millions.

40:58.797 --> 41:01.285
Let's get Green back.

41:14.124 --> 41:16.215
Tyrell's last trick.

41:17.110 --> 41:18.703
Increase.

41:19.200 --> 41:22.186
Lost perfection.

41:23.679 --> 41:25.670
But the child is born.

41:28.656 --> 41:30.149
Bring it to me.

41:30.846 --> 41:32.139
Okay, Mr Wallace.

41:40.301 --> 41:42.093
Best angel.

41:43.884 --> 41:45.078
Are not you, Luv?

43:03.111 --> 43:06.495
The green-eyed
man who killed Sapper.

43:06.594 --> 43:08.187
Find out what he knows.

43:27.794 --> 43:28.790
Hey.

43:30.183 --> 43:32.074
Come on, hi, android boy.

43:32.671 --> 43:34.065
Are you alone?

43:34.961 --> 43:36.553
The guy is Blade Runner.

43:37.150 --> 43:38.544
Let it be.

43:39.240 --> 43:41.032
Let's go, it's fucking dangerous.
- No worries.

43:41.430 --> 43:42.425
No worries.

43:48.994 --> 43:50.487
Do you buy me a cigarette?

43:57.654 --> 43:59.445
You will not even smile.

44:02.132 --> 44:03.426
Did not you listen to your friends?

44:04.422 --> 44:05.915
Do not you know what I am?

44:06.412 --> 44:07.408
I know.

44:08.303 --> 44:09.896
Rice eating rape.

44:11.488 --> 44:12.484
What is that?

44:14.076 --> 44:15.071
Wood.

44:15.967 --> 44:16.863
Oh.

44:16.963 --> 44:18.356
I have not seen the wood.

44:20.546 --> 44:21.541
It's pretty.

44:24.129 --> 44:25.323
It's dead.

44:27.214 --> 44:31.295
Who holds dead wood?

44:38.859 --> 44:40.651
You do not mind me?

44:40.750 --> 44:43.736
I can kill. What model do you have?

44:44.234 --> 44:46.225
Take your eye.

44:51.500 --> 44:53.192
The right girls
are not interested.

44:56.675 --> 44:59.164
Well, you can find me here.

48:37.335 --> 48:38.330
Hey.

48:40.421 --> 48:41.615
You can not take them.

48:42.411 --> 48:45.497
I understand. I have papers.

48:45.596 --> 48:46.592
Keep this.

48:48.980 --> 48:50.573
Yes, here.

49:08.090 --> 49:09.484
Coco is dead.

49:11.972 --> 49:13.465
Bones are gone.

49:14.361 --> 49:17.944
The information has already
leaked out. How long did it go?

49:18.939 --> 49:21.427
What you have?
And do not say "nothing".

49:22.821 --> 49:23.916
I found that.

49:25.209 --> 49:26.205
Sock?

49:28.693 --> 49:30.385
Where was it found?
- From Sapper's farm.

49:30.883 --> 49:31.878
Anything else?

49:32.475 --> 49:33.869
I burned everything else.

49:33.968 --> 49:37.352
What is this date?
Birth or Death Day?

49:37.750 --> 49:38.845
I do not know yet.

49:43.225 --> 49:45.713
Does not anyone else
see where this leads to?

49:45.812 --> 49:48.301
This is breaking the world, K.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.230
I have known many like you.

50:05.818 --> 50:07.211
Useful but...

50:08.008 --> 50:10.197
for you I forget sometimes.

50:11.193 --> 50:13.183
You were not
there when I was a kid.

50:19.553 --> 50:21.643
Do you remember anything?

50:22.738 --> 50:25.625
Before you came to the house.

50:26.222 --> 50:28.113
I have memories, but...

50:30.104 --> 50:32.094
They are not real, but transitions.

50:33.886 --> 50:37.071
Tell one of your childhood.

50:42.147 --> 50:46.526
It feels a little strange to tell
about the childhood I did not live.

50:48.815 --> 50:52.000
Will I help if I tell you?

50:54.986 --> 50:58.967
I remember a toy, a puppy.

51:00.859 --> 51:02.451
Engraving.

51:05.935 --> 51:09.418
I just remember that the boy
was trying to take it away from me.

51:10.314 --> 51:11.409
I ran away.

51:36.889 --> 51:40.770
I'm looking for a hideout,
and it's just a dark oven.

51:42.662 --> 51:45.747
It's really dark and scary, but...

51:46.245 --> 51:49.231
the horse is all out, so I go in.

52:02.170 --> 52:07.146
They will find and try to hack
me to tell, but I will not tell you.

52:13.715 --> 52:14.710
That's it.

52:17.796 --> 52:20.085
Little K defends his own.

52:22.076 --> 52:23.071
Good memory.

52:30.138 --> 52:31.133
Look here.

52:34.019 --> 52:36.508
We are all looking
for something right.

52:41.882 --> 52:43.475
What happens if I
run the whole bottle?

52:47.854 --> 52:49.447
Should I go back to work, ma'am?

52:59.599 --> 53:01.390
Report DNA Search Results.

53:15.126 --> 53:17.813
Constable KD6-3.7.

53:20.600 --> 53:21.595
Search.

53:22.093 --> 53:25.775
6.10.21 generated DNA.

53:26.174 --> 53:27.766
Discrepancies.

53:28.463 --> 53:32.245
<i>No data before pausing.</i>

53:35.729 --> 53:37.221
Satellite Crystal Copy?

53:37.421 --> 53:39.710
<i>Data can not be read.</i>

53:43.392 --> 53:45.682
Clear. Drive raw.

54:22.807 --> 54:24.499
Man is just data.

54:26.788 --> 54:28.978
A, C, T, and G.

54:29.674 --> 54:33.456
Your alphabet has four characters.

54:35.049 --> 54:36.442
I only have two.

54:40.224 --> 54:41.419
One and zero.

54:42.016 --> 54:45.400
Half less, but twice as
sleeker, sweetheart.

54:46.694 --> 54:48.386
You did not want to fuck?

54:51.173 --> 54:52.367
You listened.

54:53.761 --> 54:54.856
Perhaps.

54:57.045 --> 54:59.334
You're not enough
to tell the truth.

55:00.529 --> 55:02.320
6, 10 and 21.

55:06.700 --> 55:08.292
There is nothing to tell.

55:09.088 --> 55:11.776
How many times
have you told me?

55:14.264 --> 55:15.757
Your memories.

55:17.150 --> 55:19.241
Engraved date.

55:19.738 --> 55:21.729
6, 10 and 21.

55:23.919 --> 55:25.212
Coincidence?

55:29.691 --> 55:31.682
A dangerous coincidence.

55:35.464 --> 55:37.654
I always knew you were special.

55:39.445 --> 55:41.137
Maybe this is the specialty.

55:46.412 --> 55:47.607
Child.

55:48.602 --> 55:50.593
Born of a woman.

55:52.086 --> 55:54.076
Entered into the world.

55:55.569 --> 55:57.062
Desired.

55:58.356 --> 55:59.551
Much loved.

56:02.736 --> 56:04.527
Even if it is true,

56:06.020 --> 56:09.504
someone I would
always hunt for me.

56:11.594 --> 56:13.485
Dreams do not hurt.

56:14.580 --> 56:15.575
Is it?

56:16.769 --> 56:17.964
It hurts us.

56:23.637 --> 56:24.632
Stop.

56:25.827 --> 56:29.410
4847 and 2181 side by side.

56:35.083 --> 56:36.377
Identical.

56:37.173 --> 56:38.169
Turn.

56:41.353 --> 56:42.846
Boy and girl.

56:44.738 --> 56:45.832
Out.

56:47.126 --> 56:48.122
Why?

56:49.216 --> 56:51.804
They can not have identical DNA.

56:53.397 --> 56:56.781
The second is a copy.

57:02.056 --> 57:05.241
Both were in the Morrill Cole corpus.

57:07.431 --> 57:09.222
The girl died there.

57:09.720 --> 57:11.213
Genetic Error.

57:12.706 --> 57:14.199
Galatalaissyndrooma.

57:15.194 --> 57:16.189
Son...

57:18.976 --> 57:20.171
disappeared.

57:22.659 --> 57:24.152
Where is the orphanage?

57:26.939 --> 57:28.133
Want to ride?

58:11.927 --> 58:14.912
THE METROPOLIAL ARE ENDED

58:18.894 --> 58:22.875
Waste management in Los
Angeles County of San Diego

58:44.374 --> 58:46.762
Well, we are here.

58:59.602 --> 59:00.697
Belt closed.

01:00:00.117 --> 01:00:01.112
K?

01:00:52.768 --> 01:00:53.764
K?

01:01:51.093 --> 01:01:52.387
Stay away.

01:02:07.914 --> 01:02:10.800
Fire. Fire.

01:02:12.891 --> 01:02:13.886
Fire.

01:02:25.332 --> 01:02:27.223
60 meters to the east.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.508
Fire.

01:02:32.797 --> 01:02:33.792
North.

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.375
Fire.

01:02:38.570 --> 01:02:41.157
Stop. 20 degrees east.

01:02:43.347 --> 01:02:44.342
Stop.

01:02:45.039 --> 01:02:46.034
Getting closer.

01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:48.921
Yet.

01:02:52.703 --> 01:02:54.594
Oh you.

01:02:55.689 --> 01:02:56.684
Get up.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:02:59.073
Do your job.

01:03:00.665 --> 01:03:02.059
Find a child.

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.383
Watch the car.

01:05:18.018 --> 01:05:22.198
Every part, or out of the rain!

01:05:22.298 --> 01:05:23.890
Came into the beam!

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:25.881
You work.

01:05:26.279 --> 01:05:29.364
If you do not, I do not need you.

01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:31.355
I do not need any...

01:05:34.241 --> 01:05:35.237
Hey.

01:05:42.303 --> 01:05:44.792
Nickel is for colonies.

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:50.764
Closer from here can
not get a great outdoors.

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:55.242
The game keeps them active...

01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:57.731
and makes them handy.

01:05:58.826 --> 01:06:00.219
But work it is.

01:06:01.115 --> 01:06:04.200
The job makes it unnecessary.

01:06:13.059 --> 01:06:14.153
Well.

01:06:16.044 --> 01:06:17.637
What are you looking for?

01:06:21.618 --> 01:06:24.604
Because I have all kinds.

01:06:27.192 --> 01:06:29.083
No no no...
- I do not buy.

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.069
I am an honest player.

01:06:32.168 --> 01:06:33.562
Listen...

01:06:34.159 --> 01:06:35.552
You even bigger...

01:06:38.339 --> 01:06:41.027
Even bigger players
tried to stop me...

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:42.122
and they were...

01:06:42.619 --> 01:06:44.510
hard players.

01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:49.487
I'm looking for a boy for 30 years.

01:06:50.283 --> 01:06:51.975
I need your accounting.

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.956
Investments, sales, all.

01:06:56.454 --> 01:06:57.947
So the old ones
are not in the books.

01:06:58.445 --> 01:06:59.938
Is not it?
- No, no.

01:07:02.426 --> 01:07:05.412
Sorry. I can not help.

01:07:08.895 --> 01:07:10.388
Are not you?
- No.

01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.360
Yes you can.

01:07:19.147 --> 01:07:21.337
You have a good memory.

01:07:22.431 --> 01:07:25.816
Tell me what to remember,
or shoot the hole and look at myself.

01:07:40.646 --> 01:07:42.736
They laughed at you...

01:08:02.343 --> 01:08:03.637
Are you coming?

01:08:14.685 --> 01:08:15.680
Where is it?

01:08:19.264 --> 01:08:20.259
Oh God.

01:08:25.733 --> 01:08:27.027
Where, where, where?

01:08:30.212 --> 01:08:32.004
I can not find it.

01:08:40.961 --> 01:08:41.957
It's gone.

01:08:44.743 --> 01:08:46.933
The whole year is torn.

01:08:49.122 --> 01:08:50.417
I did not do it.

01:08:51.313 --> 01:08:52.407
It was not me.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:57.185
I do not...

01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.474
I did not.

01:13:31.890 --> 01:13:35.573
I always said
that you are special.

01:13:40.051 --> 01:13:43.037
Born, not made.

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:48.512
Hidden with care.

01:13:52.294 --> 01:13:53.986
Right boy.

01:13:56.972 --> 01:13:58.962
The real boy needs the right name.

01:14:00.754 --> 01:14:01.749
Joe.

01:14:03.939 --> 01:14:04.934
"Joe"?

01:14:05.432 --> 01:14:07.422
You are too important for K.

01:14:08.617 --> 01:14:10.408
Your mother would have named you.

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:14.788
Joe.

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:18.072
Joe.

01:14:18.172 --> 01:14:19.167
Do not.

01:14:26.035 --> 01:14:28.324
How do I know if
memory is a move or not?

01:14:32.803 --> 01:14:34.296
Who does the memories do?

01:15:06.146 --> 01:15:07.639
Dr. Ana Stelline?

01:15:11.819 --> 01:15:12.814
Guest.

01:15:15.701 --> 01:15:16.696
Is that okay?

01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:18.886
Suitable for.

01:15:21.075 --> 01:15:22.568
Unusual only.

01:15:24.459 --> 01:15:28.540
Fun to meet, Constable KD6-3.7.

01:15:33.118 --> 01:15:34.114
Sorry.

01:15:34.611 --> 01:15:36.502
Immune Deficiency.

01:15:37.398 --> 01:15:40.981
Freedom behind the glass.

01:15:41.877 --> 01:15:43.470
Why did not you stay here?

01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:44.664
So.

01:15:45.261 --> 01:15:48.446
I would have gone with
my parents, but I got sick.

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:50.536
So...

01:15:51.532 --> 01:15:53.920
my life changed.

01:15:54.617 --> 01:15:57.902
They put me in my cup

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.888
filling it with what they
can to keep me happy

01:16:01.385 --> 01:16:03.376
except with the club of course.

01:16:03.973 --> 01:16:05.366
I was used to people.

01:16:09.248 --> 01:16:10.841
How can I help?

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:14.324
I thought you
could help the story.

01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:21.291
The most interesting offer at a time.

01:16:22.784 --> 01:16:25.770
Do you think I'm
working at the same time?

01:16:26.766 --> 01:16:27.761
Of course.

01:16:35.126 --> 01:16:37.216
I promise to hear every word.

01:16:44.482 --> 01:16:47.169
You are considered to be the
best memory in the country.

01:16:47.468 --> 01:16:49.160
Kindness.

01:16:50.752 --> 01:16:52.644
I love birthday parties.

01:16:56.724 --> 01:16:58.118
Do you work for Wallace?

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:02.099
I am one of his subcontractors.

01:17:02.696 --> 01:17:06.080
He made a bid, but I
stay an entrepreneur.

01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:09.564
What Makes You So Good?

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:13.047
What makes your
memories so authentic?

01:17:13.445 --> 01:17:17.029
Well, there is always
something in your work.

01:17:18.024 --> 01:17:21.507
But I've been here
eight years old.

01:17:22.801 --> 01:17:25.489
To see the world it
was supposed to imagine.

01:17:27.778 --> 01:17:30.465
I came to see
you as an imaginator.

01:17:32.257 --> 01:17:35.442
Wallace needs me to
be a functional product.

01:17:37.134 --> 01:17:38.925
I'm doing it for kindness.

01:17:40.816 --> 01:17:42.907
Replicants are hard.

01:17:43.106 --> 01:17:45.893
For jobs that people would not do.

01:17:46.689 --> 01:17:51.864
I can not change your destiny,
but my memory brings a smile.

01:17:53.357 --> 01:17:54.353
Strongly done.

01:17:54.452 --> 01:17:57.339
Kivemmin. They seem authentic.

01:17:57.438 --> 01:18:00.324
And the real memories are...

01:18:00.822 --> 01:18:02.813
genuine feelings.

01:18:04.107 --> 01:18:05.301
Is not that right?

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.240
Are all made, or is it true?

01:18:22.420 --> 01:18:25.207
Using the right memories
is illegal, constable.

01:18:27.397 --> 01:18:29.188
How do they
differentiate between them?

01:18:29.587 --> 01:18:31.179
Can you identify...

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:34.165
realistic?

01:18:36.753 --> 01:18:38.644
It is believed that it is in detail.

01:18:39.639 --> 01:18:41.630
But memory does
not work that way.

01:18:42.924 --> 01:18:44.616
We remember our feelings.

01:18:45.312 --> 01:18:48.099
It's a mess.

01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:51.583
I can show you.

01:18:53.474 --> 01:18:54.569
Sit down.

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:17.461
Think of the memory
you want to look like.

01:19:18.357 --> 01:19:20.447
Just imagine.

01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.935
Freely.

01:20:13.298 --> 01:20:15.189
Someone says this.

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.175
This happened.

01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:36.588
It is true.

01:20:48.532 --> 01:20:49.527
It is true.

01:20:53.259 --> 01:20:56.494
Goddamn it!

01:21:40.487 --> 01:21:45.065
<i>Constable KD6-3.7, Mrs. calls.</i>

01:21:45.165 --> 01:21:48.748
<i>Drop your gun and
keep your hands visible.</i>

01:21:49.942 --> 01:21:50.937
<i>- Cells.</i>
- Cells.

01:21:51.037 --> 01:21:52.729
<i>Have you ever
been in the facility?</i>

01:21:52.828 --> 01:21:53.923
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

01:21:54.023 --> 01:21:56.909
<i>Are you locked in free?</i>

01:21:57.009 --> 01:21:58.004
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

01:21:58.104 --> 01:21:59.398
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:02.383
<i>How do you feel like
holding your beloved hand?</i>

01:22:02.483 --> 01:22:05.270
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

01:22:05.369 --> 01:22:07.360
<i>Together with the cell.</i>
- In one of the cellars.

01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.554
<i>Too bad.</i>
- Too bad.

01:22:08.654 --> 01:22:10.545
<i>How does it feel
to be full of fear?</i>

01:22:10.644 --> 01:22:11.640
<i>Evil.</i>
- Too bad.

01:22:11.739 --> 01:22:13.730
<i>Do you like your life apart?</i>

01:22:13.829 --> 01:22:14.825
<i>Contrast.</i>
- Contrast.

01:22:14.924 --> 01:22:16.915
<i>With a bad contrast.</i>
- It's a bad contrast.

01:22:17.014 --> 01:22:18.010
<i>Night.</i>
- Night.

01:22:18.109 --> 01:22:20.498
<i>Together with the cell.</i>
- In one of the cellars.

01:22:20.598 --> 01:22:23.285
<i>For the same.</i>
- For the same.

01:22:23.384 --> 01:22:25.574
<i>And for the bad contrast.</i>
- And the bad contrast.

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.167
<i>Against the night.</i>
- Against the night.

01:22:27.266 --> 01:22:29.058
<i>The fountain of the valley.</i>

01:22:30.252 --> 01:22:32.044
The fountain of the valley.

01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:36.522
<i>You are not near a parable.</i>

01:22:42.992 --> 01:22:44.485
Out! Door shut.

01:22:45.779 --> 01:22:47.471
What the fuck did you get?

01:22:48.068 --> 01:22:49.959
I gave you the job.

01:22:50.258 --> 01:22:52.447
I emphasized the importance,

01:22:52.547 --> 01:22:55.931
and you reel at
the refreshment center.

01:22:57.922 --> 01:23:00.111
According to the control,
you have something else.

01:23:00.211 --> 01:23:02.301
Far from the benchmark.

01:23:02.401 --> 01:23:03.893
Do you know what it means?

01:23:03.993 --> 01:23:04.988
I found the child.

01:23:10.064 --> 01:23:13.349
He had been made a
standard mate of basic service.

01:23:16.235 --> 01:23:17.828
She did not know who she was.

01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:22.008
Yeah?
- It's done.

01:23:22.108 --> 01:23:24.795
Meaning?
- What did you ask.

01:23:26.686 --> 01:23:27.781
It's done.

01:23:35.942 --> 01:23:37.734
You just got a bomb.

01:23:39.824 --> 01:23:40.819
Good job.

01:23:43.805 --> 01:23:45.696
I'm gonna drive you
from the station alive.

01:23:45.796 --> 01:23:48.185
But you have 48 hours to find out.

01:23:48.881 --> 01:23:50.772
Release your gun and your badge.

01:23:50.872 --> 01:23:53.659
In the next control I can not help.

01:23:55.948 --> 01:23:56.943
Thank you, ma'am.

01:24:29.390 --> 01:24:30.485
You were right.

01:24:37.751 --> 01:24:39.443
You were right in everything.

01:25:08.307 --> 01:25:11.293
I thought I did not
care about the artist.

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:16.269
I noticed you liked him.

01:25:19.554 --> 01:25:20.748
I want this.

01:25:21.843 --> 01:25:22.838
She is true.

01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:27.218
I want to be right for you.

01:25:28.910 --> 01:25:30.701
You're right for me.

01:25:31.995 --> 01:25:33.687
You have a good woman.

01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:54.589
Well, do it.

01:26:17.083 --> 01:26:18.476
Look at the girl.

01:26:18.874 --> 01:26:20.467
Hush now. He
needs to be synchronized.

01:29:16.238 --> 01:29:19.125
<i>Oh, whatever you want.</i>

01:29:21.414 --> 01:29:24.101
<i>Oh, wherever you want.</i>

01:29:54.359 --> 01:29:57.444
<i>99.9% sterile water.</i>

01:30:27.602 --> 01:30:28.995
It's from wood.

01:30:29.095 --> 01:30:30.289
That was it.

01:30:31.683 --> 01:30:32.777
You can leave.

01:30:44.821 --> 01:30:45.816
Hush now.

01:30:46.911 --> 01:30:48.205
I have been inside of you.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.191
There's not much left there.

01:31:10.599 --> 01:31:11.594
Coffee?

01:31:17.865 --> 01:31:19.557
They'll come soon.

01:31:28.813 --> 01:31:30.008
I'll come with you.

01:31:31.302 --> 01:31:32.496
But I did not.

01:31:33.690 --> 01:31:37.472
They can come from
here for all my memories.

01:31:38.766 --> 01:31:40.956
You have to remove
me from the terminal.

01:31:42.349 --> 01:31:43.444
My gift.

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:46.928
Put me there.

01:31:49.615 --> 01:31:50.909
I can not do it.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:53.895

01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:57.379
If something happens
to that, that's it.

01:31:58.872 --> 01:31:59.867
You are gone.

01:32:00.564 --> 01:32:01.559
So.

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.346

01:32:10.815 --> 01:32:11.811

01:32:15.394 --> 01:32:16.787
Joe, please.

01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:19.773
I want it.

01:32:23.854 --> 01:32:25.247
I can not do it myself.

01:32:43.561 --> 01:32:44.656
Replace the antenna.

01:33:16.804 --> 01:33:18.994
The right tree.
You're rich, buddy.

01:33:19.989 --> 01:33:22.378
I can get you the right horse.

01:33:22.477 --> 01:33:25.065
Do you want the right horse?

01:33:25.165 --> 01:33:26.459
I do not need.

01:33:27.056 --> 01:33:29.743
Really. Like Wallace.

01:33:29.843 --> 01:33:31.435
I do not need
the right horse, just...

01:33:32.630 --> 01:33:33.924
Just what it is.

01:33:37.805 --> 01:33:39.398

01:33:40.791 --> 01:33:42.881
But it's newer.

01:33:44.673 --> 01:33:46.365
The reactor radiation?

01:33:46.464 --> 01:33:48.853
No, more unstable.

01:33:51.242 --> 01:33:52.834
Old, old.

01:33:54.228 --> 01:33:55.820
Or a dirty bomb.

01:33:56.318 --> 01:34:00.299
Only one place has had
so high radioactivity.

01:34:04.181 --> 01:34:05.773
Only one place is so dirty.

01:34:08.262 --> 01:34:09.257
No one is living there.

01:34:10.252 --> 01:34:13.736
You wanted to know
where the puppet was.

01:34:14.034 --> 01:34:19.210
I told you what,
what do you want now?

01:34:20.006 --> 01:34:23.689
Horses, goats, papers

01:36:36.961 --> 01:36:38.056

01:36:39.449 --> 01:36:40.544

Where is he?

01:36:49.999 --> 01:36:50.995
I have no idea.

01:36:52.687 --> 01:36:53.980
She is free.

01:37:05.825 --> 01:37:06.919
It is not.

01:37:10.503 --> 01:37:11.896
He destroyed it.

01:37:14.484 --> 01:37:16.375
Everything about him.

01:37:17.072 --> 01:37:19.858
Except the box you already made.

01:37:24.536 --> 01:37:27.821
But that was not
enough when you came.

01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:37.276

01:37:51.211 --> 01:37:52.704

01:37:54.396 --> 01:37:55.690
Where is he?!

01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:01.164
You are so sure.

01:38:02.856 --> 01:38:04.647
Because she told me.

01:38:05.245 --> 01:38:07.136
Because we're not lying.

01:38:09.027 --> 01:38:11.615
I tell Mr Wallace that
you were trying to shoot.

01:38:13.008 --> 01:38:14.600

01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:22.466
I also read.

01:44:24.059 --> 01:44:26.846

01:44:55.710 --> 01:44:56.705

01:45:03.672 --> 01:45:04.667
Really?

01:45:07.753 --> 01:45:08.748
So what?

01:45:11.336 --> 01:45:13.128
I just have questions.

01:45:14.123 --> 01:45:15.367
What are the questions?

01:45:33.432 --> 01:45:34.427
Place.

01:48:07.506 --> 01:48:10.292
Listen, I do not want to hurt you.

01:48:10.690 --> 01:48:12.283

01:49:29.419 --> 01:49:30.415
Take the swords.

01:49:39.372 --> 01:49:40.865
This is just something.

01:49:41.463 --> 01:49:42.856

01:49:43.752 --> 01:49:44.847

01:51:56.426 --> 01:51:57.720
Were you here together?

01:51:58.019 --> 01:51:59.213

01:52:07.076 --> 01:52:08.071
Which question?

01:52:08.171 --> 01:52:10.659

01:52:43.803 --> 01:52:45.993
Did you send him orphanage?

01:52:49.178 --> 01:52:50.969
I had left the times then.

01:52:54.851 --> 01:52:56.443

01:52:59.628 --> 01:53:00.624
Why do not you?

01:53:02.017 --> 01:53:03.908
I remain in the plan.

01:53:06.496 --> 01:53:10.378

up information, covering traces.

the trails forever.

01:53:18.440 --> 01:53:20.331
I would not have found her.

01:53:20.928 --> 01:53:21.923

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:23.814
Not really.

01:53:24.412 --> 01:53:25.208
Why do not you?

01:53:25.307 --> 01:53:27.796
We were hunted.

children to be found.

The stranger.

01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:19.785

01:56:20.581 --> 01:56:21.975

Someone wants to meet you.

02:02:46.462 --> 02:02:47.657
You can count on us.

02:02:56.117 --> 02:02:58.605
You want me to look up to the left.

02:03:04.776 --> 02:03:06.070
This is Frey.

02:03:06.965 --> 02:03:09.056
He was with Kalashniki in Saphir.

02:03:09.354 --> 02:03:10.549
I recognize you.

02:03:13.136 --> 02:03:15.027
Did you help hide the child?

02:03:17.317 --> 02:03:18.511
I was there.

02:03:22.691 --> 02:03:24.483
I saw a miracle birth.

02:03:26.075 --> 02:03:28.962

He died in my arms.

02:03:53.845 --> 02:03:55.337
We hid the baby

02:03:55.437 --> 02:03:57.826
and we vowed
to keep our secrets.

02:03:58.722 --> 02:04:00.812
That's why Sapper killed himself.

02:04:02.404 --> 02:04:08.276
The child made us
more than slaves.

02:04:09.570 --> 02:04:11.760
If a child can become of us,

02:04:12.357 --> 02:04:15.244
we are our own cronies.

We build an army.

02:04:25.893 --> 02:04:27.685
I want to release us.

02:04:36.444 --> 02:04:39.629

02:04:45.302 --> 02:04:48.238
Deckard, Sapper, you, me.

02:04:48.338 --> 02:04:51.572
Our lives do not mean anything
near the approaching storm.

02:04:52.966 --> 02:04:57.047
Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.

02:05:00.232 --> 02:05:02.023
You led to Wallace Deckard.

02:05:03.118 --> 02:05:07.000
You can not let Deckard
guide Wallace to me.

02:05:07.597 --> 02:05:09.488
You have to kill Deckard.

02:05:18.943 --> 02:05:21.432
Deckard just wanted
his baby to be safe.

02:05:22.526 --> 02:05:23.920
The child is safe.

02:05:26.209 --> 02:05:29.394
When time comes, I'll
show the girl to the world.

02:05:29.792 --> 02:05:31.634
He will lead our army.

02:05:31.882 --> 02:05:32.878
A girl?

02:05:33.574 --> 02:05:34.868
Of course.

02:05:35.665 --> 02:05:37.357
Rachael got a daughter.

02:05:38.949 --> 02:05:41.835
That's how he
comes with my own eyes.

02:05:42.831 --> 02:05:45.817
I got him blue when
the departure came.

02:05:45.916 --> 02:05:47.807
You hid the boy.

02:05:50.097 --> 02:05:52.784
Only a piece of puzzle piece.

02:06:09.903 --> 02:06:12.192
Did you think it was you?

02:06:15.576 --> 02:06:16.572
You thought.

02:06:17.667 --> 02:06:18.662
You thought.

02:06:21.946 --> 02:06:23.638
We all liked it as well.

02:06:25.629 --> 02:06:27.122
That's why we believe.

02:06:44.042 --> 02:06:45.535
<i>Someone says this.</i>

02:06:48.322 --> 02:06:52.502
<i>I showed you how to mess
up information, covering traces.</i>

02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.488
<i>That's how he
comes with my own eyes.</i>

02:06:57.180 --> 02:07:00.465
<i>I got him blue when
the departure came.</i>

02:07:01.560 --> 02:07:04.446
<i>There is always
something in your job.</i>

02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:43.761
That jumps always.

02:07:45.353 --> 02:07:48.240
Without thinking of what
you would do on the ground.

02:07:49.533 --> 02:07:53.714
Courage can not
change the truth.

02:07:58.889 --> 02:08:03.667
I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

02:08:22.379 --> 02:08:24.568
You are a miracle
to me, Mr Deckard.

02:08:30.839 --> 02:08:32.033
I had a lock.

02:08:34.223 --> 02:08:36.014
I found the key.

02:08:37.706 --> 02:08:39.150
But the pins are not in line

02:08:39.249 --> 02:08:41.986
and the door stays locked.

02:08:44.972 --> 02:08:47.958
I need a sample piece, Mr Deckard.

02:08:52.039 --> 02:08:53.034
That child.

02:08:54.925 --> 02:08:56.418
I need her baby.

02:08:58.011 --> 02:09:00.399
I'm teaching everything to fly.

02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:12.343
"God remembered Rachel,

02:09:14.732 --> 02:09:15.827
he heard her

02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:18.813
and opened her womb. "

02:09:19.907 --> 02:09:21.301
<i>Do you hold our owls?</i>

02:09:24.287 --> 02:09:25.780
<i>Is it artificial?</i>

02:09:27.074 --> 02:09:28.268
<i>Of course it is.</i>

02:09:30.458 --> 02:09:31.752
<i>It's probably expensive.</i>

02:09:33.941 --> 02:09:34.937
<i>Very.</i>

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.728
<i>I'm Rachael.</i>

02:09:37.624 --> 02:09:38.719
<i>Deckard.</i>

02:09:50.961 --> 02:09:52.155
Is the feeling the same

02:09:54.047 --> 02:09:56.137
now than then

02:09:59.123 --> 02:10:00.616
when did you meet?

02:10:10.967 --> 02:10:17.038
All these years of the
perfection of the memory drilled.

02:10:20.621 --> 02:10:22.512
How shiny his lips.

02:10:23.010 --> 02:10:25.001
Your immediate contact.

02:10:28.783 --> 02:10:32.963
Did you mind that
you were just called?

02:10:35.053 --> 02:10:40.428
Planned to fall in love right then.

02:10:42.817 --> 02:10:47.893
Make a perfect model.

02:10:51.476 --> 02:10:53.865
So if planned.

02:10:55.756 --> 02:10:56.751
Love

02:10:57.448 --> 02:10:59.836
or mathematical punctuality.

02:11:05.808 --> 02:11:06.804
Which

02:11:08.097 --> 02:11:09.093
or the camp?

02:11:14.069 --> 02:11:15.761
I know what's true.

02:11:40.047 --> 02:11:43.132
It was a shame
to keep yourself out.

02:11:43.431 --> 02:11:46.616
And it did not
pay like anything.

02:11:51.194 --> 02:11:53.085
But you can still help.

02:11:54.777 --> 02:11:57.564
You got help hiding.

02:12:00.252 --> 02:12:01.546
Where did they go?

02:12:03.835 --> 02:12:05.527
I know you know something.

02:12:07.020 --> 02:12:08.015
Help me...

02:12:09.408 --> 02:12:12.494
and good things can happen.

02:12:18.565 --> 02:12:19.959
You have no children.

02:12:24.039 --> 02:12:25.035
Is it?

02:12:25.931 --> 02:12:27.921
Millions.

02:12:30.609 --> 02:12:33.395
Do you think I
can only offer pain?

02:12:34.092 --> 02:12:35.386
But I know.

02:12:37.178 --> 02:12:38.372
You love the pain.

02:12:40.163 --> 02:12:44.344
It reminds you of your happiness.

02:12:46.633 --> 02:12:47.827
More luck then.

02:12:54.695 --> 02:12:56.287
Do not be afraid.

02:13:11.516 --> 02:13:12.710
Angel.

02:13:14.203 --> 02:13:15.696
Re-created.

02:13:19.876 --> 02:13:20.872
To you.

02:13:55.309 --> 02:13:56.504
Did you miss me?

02:14:15.016 --> 02:14:16.211
Do not you love me?

02:14:35.619 --> 02:14:36.814
His eyes were green.

02:14:54.630 --> 02:14:55.724
In the outside world

02:14:57.118 --> 02:14:59.706
let me talk to you.

02:15:02.194 --> 02:15:04.185
You do not feel the pain yet.

02:15:06.474 --> 02:15:07.668
But you learn.

02:15:20.109 --> 02:15:21.602
<i>Hello handsome.</i>

02:15:38.821 --> 02:15:41.011
<i>What day, huh?</i>

02:15:44.992 --> 02:15:46.485
<i>Orpo expression.</i>

02:15:47.978 --> 02:15:49.471
<i>I can fix it.</i>

02:15:53.253 --> 02:15:55.941
<i>You look good at the river.</i>

02:16:14.105 --> 02:16:18.086
JOI - ALL YOU WANT
TO BE BEING AND VIEW

02:16:31.075 --> 02:16:36.251
<i>Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.</i>

02:16:39.436 --> 02:16:41.227
<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

02:17:20.243 --> 02:17:23.329
<i>Get to the airspace of
Los Angeles Airport.</i>

02:17:23.428 --> 02:17:24.722
<i>Tunnistautukaa.</i>

02:17:24.822 --> 02:17:28.007
Transportation S-14-4-XD.

02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:34.974
Where are we going?

02:17:36.367 --> 02:17:37.462
Home.

02:18:31.806 --> 02:18:36.184
<i>Engine 2 inoperative.
The spare motor is connected.</i>

02:18:37.181 --> 02:18:38.175
<i>Warning.</i>

02:18:38.474 --> 02:18:40.664
Does it work?
- Too low!

02:18:41.659 --> 02:18:42.655
Get back!

02:19:32.022 --> 02:19:33.017
Up.

02:19:57.800 --> 02:19:58.796
Open the door.

02:21:51.465 --> 02:21:52.759
I am the best.

02:22:33.865 --> 02:22:35.059
The outside world is waiting.

02:24:48.331 --> 02:24:49.326
Joe.

02:24:49.824 --> 02:24:50.819
Joe!

02:25:00.872 --> 02:25:01.867
Joe!

02:25:41.381 --> 02:25:43.172
You would have let me die.

02:25:44.566 --> 02:25:45.661
Annoinkin.

02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:51.135
You fucked.

02:25:57.505 --> 02:25:59.097
You can meet your daughter now.

02:27:24.296 --> 02:27:26.187
The best memories are her.

02:27:35.841 --> 02:27:36.837
Why?

02:27:39.823 --> 02:27:41.116
Who am I to you?

02:27:50.970 --> 02:27:52.065
Meet your daughter.

02:27:58.733 --> 02:28:00.027
Are you okay?

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:36.788
Just a moment.

02:30:39.774 --> 02:30:41.018
Is not it beautiful?

02:31:13.615 --> 02:31:15.605
DO NOT COPY in any format!
