08:06.010 --> 08:07.568
YOU ARE UNDER OATH.

I ATE AN OLD-SCHOOL
SALISBURY STEAK TV DINNER,

08:10.790 --> 08:12.189
BUT I ATE THE BROWNIE FIRST.

08:12.220 --> 08:13.687

08:26.430 --> 08:29.228
I DON'T THINK JUROR NUMBER FIVE
LIKES YOU AT ALL.

08:29.270 --> 08:32.603
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE ME?

08:32.640 --> 08:35.370

BECAUSE I AM SENSING THAT
WE BECOME VERY MUCH INVOLVED.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.277

SHAWN.

10:17.310 --> 10:18.800

YOUR CORN-SILK HAIR NESTLED
ON THIS GENTLEMAN'S SHOULDER,

10:25.790 --> 10:27.758
RIGHT IN THE CROOK.

BUT YOU'RE ADORABLE
WHEN YOU'RE IN DENIAL.

10:36.500 --> 10:37.762
- DO NOT TALK TO HIM.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.598
- SHAWN, GUS!
THANK YOU AGAIN.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.494
OH, BUT NOW I HAVE
SO MUCH WORK TO DO.

10:42.540 --> 10:44.804
ALL THESE DEPOSITIONS AND
WITNESS REPORTS TO COMB OVER.

10:44.840 --> 10:47.434
I HAVEN'T EVEN CRACKED OPEN
THE RUBEN LEONARD FILE.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.277
CAN I COUNT ON YOUR HELP?
- SORRY, HORNSTOCK.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.244
IT'S JUST, UH,

TASTE THINGS, AND SMELL THINGS.

10:53.220 --> 10:54.539

11:35.390 --> 11:37.278
- NOW, NOT TO BE A SKEPTIC,

11:37.330 --> 11:38.786
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK

11:38.830 --> 11:40.297
I'VE HEARD
OF A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE BEFORE.

11:40.330 --> 11:41.524
HAVE YOU, MORTY?
- NO, NO, I HAVE NOT.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.549
NO, CONNIE, NO.
- YEAH.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.227

MAYBE.

11:46.330 --> 11:48.389

11:48.440 --> 11:50.408

SANDRA PANITCH, SHE IS FACING
SOME VERY SERIOUS CHARGES,

AND I CERTAINLY
DON'T WANNA TRY HER

11:54.710 --> 11:56.405
IN THE COURT OF PUBLIC OPINION.
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

11:56.440 --> 11:57.748
- BUT I WILL SAY THIS.

11:57.780 --> 11:59.372
THINGS DO NOT
LOOK GOOD FOR HER.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.412
- NO, THEY DO NOT.
- RIGHT? OH, MY GOD.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.589
NOT TO MENTION THE SHENANIGANS
OF HER ATTORNEY.

12:03.620 --> 12:04.882
- OH, YEAH.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.649
- ADAM...

12:06.690 --> 12:08.248
HORNSTOCK.
HE IS AN ODD DUCK, ISN'T HE?

12:08.290 --> 12:09.552
- YEAH.
- ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

12:09.590 --> 12:11.455
WOULDN'T YOU SAY THAT
ABOUT HIM?

12:11.490 --> 12:12.889

HAVE YOUR WORK CUT OUT FOR YOU.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.397

OH, DOOGIE HOWSER.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.503

12:23.540 --> 12:25.405
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
JACKSON HALE WAS A COLLEAGUE,

12:25.440 --> 12:27.431
BUT HE WAS ALSO A DEAR FRIEND.

12:27.480 --> 12:28.970
AND I THINK WE ALL
JUST WANT JUSTICE.

12:29.010 --> 12:30.602
- MM-HMM,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE WE WANT

12:30.650 --> 12:31.969
IS TO SEE YOU GUYS
WHEN WE COME BACK...

12:32.010 --> 12:34.478
- HEY!

12:34.520 --> 12:35.839
- AND WE'RE CLEAR.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.609

12:37.650 --> 12:39.481
- SO...

12:39.520 --> 12:42.182
- SHAWN,
I WOULD GET A HUGE KICK

12:42.220 --> 12:44.757
OUT OF YOU USING
YOUR PSYCHIC POWERS

12:44.790 --> 12:49.124
TO TELL ME
WHAT I AM THINKING RIGHT NOW.

12:49.160 --> 12:50.491
- OH.

12:50.530 --> 12:52.088
- YEAH, SURE, I CAN DO THAT.

12:52.130 --> 12:53.563
THERE'S A BIT
OF PAGEANTRY INVOLVED, SO...

IT'S A PHYSICAL PROCESS.

12:58.710 --> 12:59.734
[laughs]
- MM.

12:59.770 --> 13:02.944
AND HERE IT IS.

13:02.980 --> 13:04.641
I THINK I'VE GOT IT.

13:04.680 --> 13:05.977
THE THOUGHTS THAT YOU'RE HAVING
ABOUT MY PARTNER

13:06.010 --> 13:07.875
NOT SUITABLE
FOR A MORNING SHOW.

13:10.520 --> 13:11.782
YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING
SOMETHING ELSE RIGHT NOW TOO.

13:11.820 --> 13:13.481
IT'S PRETTY JUICY.

13:13.520 --> 13:15.385
YOU GUYS AREN'T EVEN TOGETHER
RIGHT NOW.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.887
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?
- [laughs] I DON'T THINK SO.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.557
- MORTY'S NOT EVEN STAYING
AT THE HOUSE, GUS.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.421
YEAH, HE'S CHILLING AT A MOTEL.
- REALLY?

13:20.460 --> 13:22.826
- THAT CAN'T BE GOOD, SO
YOUR RELATIONSHIP'S A SHAM THEN,

13:22.870 --> 13:25.327
WHICH MEANS THAT THIS WHOLE SHOW
IS A SHAM.

13:25.370 --> 13:26.598
- IT'S A SHAM. HEY, GET OFF!
- HEY, COME ON.

13:26.630 --> 13:27.858
- YOU GET OFF!
- MORTY, HEY!

13:27.900 --> 13:29.299

ALL RIGHT!
- STOP!

13:36.410 --> 13:37.877
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

13:37.910 --> 13:40.242
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FIGURED OUT
ANY OF THAT,

13:40.280 --> 13:41.941
BUT IT IS NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.744
- EVERYTHING IN THE PSYCHIC
REALM IS MY BUSINESS, JACK.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.679
- AND IT'S TRUE, ALL RIGHT?
OUR MARRIAGE IS ON THE BENDS.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.951
BUT THE NETWORK

13:50.990 --> 13:52.457
FOR THE SAKE OF THE SHOW.

13:52.490 --> 13:54.492
- THERE IS MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

13:54.530 --> 13:55.929
WE'RE WORKING IT OUT.
- WE REALLY ARE.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.393

- I WARNED HIM.
- IT GETS HIM KILLED.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.004
[whispering]
IT GETS HIM KILLED.

14:08.040 --> 14:09.803
ALSO, I DON'T MIND SAYING,

14:09.840 --> 14:11.444
BEING SINGLE II/INWTHIS TOWN...

14:11.480 --> 14:13.619
- IS WORSE THAN DEATH,
YOU KNOW?

14:13.650 --> 14:15.675
AND I HAVE STARTED

I CAN JIM CAVIEZEL MY WAY

WHAT IS THIS?

15:06.030 --> 15:09.090
- THIS IS A GREEN SCREEN,
SO WE CAN SUPERIMPOSE

15:09.140 --> 15:11.199
ANY IMAGES OF THE WEATHER
WE WOULD LIKE ONTO IT.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.401
- HE WOULD BRING A GIRL BACK
TO WHERE HE DOES THE WEATHER?

15:13.440 --> 15:14.907
WAS THIS A TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT
FOR HIM?

15:14.940 --> 15:17.147
- I DIDN'T REALLY
KNOW HIM ENOUGH TO SAY.

15:17.180 --> 15:21.116
RUMOR HAS IT HE WAS
INTO SOME PRETTY KINKY STUFF.

15:21.150 --> 15:24.039
I GUESS SOME GIRLS
LIKE A WEATHER SET AND A CAMERA.

15:24.090 --> 15:26.650
- GUS DOES THE SAME THING, BUT
HE'S THE ONLY ONE IN THE VIDEOS.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.555
- MY TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT
IS ALONE ON MY COUCH

15:28.590 --> 15:31.423
EATING LEI-TOVER SHISHITO PEPPERS
AND WATCHING JERICHO.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.951
- REALLY?
- FOLLOW ME.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.399
- GUESS THERE'S A LID
FOR EVERY POT.

15:35.430 --> 15:37.159
- YEAH.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.667
- THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP
ALL OUR NEWSCASTERS' OFFICES,

15:38.700 --> 15:40.395
OUR EDITING BAYS ALSO.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.738
SEVERAL NOTICES FOR CAT-SITTERS
IF YOU NEED ANY.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.658
- HEY, HO, HO!

15:44.710 --> 15:46.701
THIS HERE IS THE BREAK ROOM?

15:46.740 --> 15:47.729
- ARE THOSE SNACKS?
- MAY WE PARTAKE?

15:47.780 --> 15:48.974
- ARE THEY FREE?
I CALL IT FIRST.

15:49.010 --> 15:49.829
- JUST NEED A LITTLE SOMETHING
TO HOLD ME OVER.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.939
- VISITORS DON'T GET SNACKS.

15:51.980 --> 15:53.709
THIS ALSO DOUBLES
AS RUBEN LEONARD'S OFFICE.

15:53.750 --> 15:55.911
HE IS OUR ROVING
HUMAN INTEREST REPORTER.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.884
- OH.
- ALTHOUGH MOST OF HIS STORIES

15:57.920 --> 16:00.150
ARE USUALLY NEITHER
OF THOSE THINGS.

16:00.190 --> 16:03.580
RUBEN IS TAKING OVER
AS OUR TEMPORARY WEATHERMAN.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.757
- I HAVEN'T EVEN CRACKED OPEN
THE RUBEN LEONARD FILE.

16:05.790 --> 16:08.657
- PRISCILLA, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE RUBEN IS ROVING

16:08.700 --> 16:11.089
AT THIS VERY MOMENT?

16:13.000 --> 16:15.560
GUS, THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT IT FEELS LIKE

16:15.600 --> 16:17.739
TO WALK ON THE MOON
IF THE MOON WAS BLACK.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.738
- THE MOON IS BLACK, SHAWN.
- WHAT?

16:19.770 --> 16:21.408
- THE MOON IS BLACK,
AEGEUS IS BLACK,

16:21.440 --> 16:23.169
AND GRIMACE IS BLACK.
END OF STORY.

16:23.210 --> 16:25.849
- WHOA, GUS!
I THINK THAT'S RUBEN LEONARD.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.370
- IS HE DEAD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.911
RUBEN?

16:29.950 --> 16:32.612
RUBEN!

16:32.650 --> 16:34.083
RUBEN!

16:34.120 --> 16:36.213
[both shout]

16:37.330 --> 16:38.786
RUBEN!
RUBEN LEONARD!

16:38.830 --> 16:41.424
- [groaning]
- HE'S ALIVE, HE'S ALIVE!

16:41.460 --> 16:44.429
- HOO!

16:44.470 --> 16:46.324
I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

16:46.370 --> 16:47.689
I JUST HAVE A SCOLIOSIS ROD
IN MY BACK,

16:47.740 --> 16:49.867
SO UNEVEN SURFACES
ARE NOT MY FRIEND.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.232
- OH, OKAY.
I SEE.

16:52.270 --> 16:53.976
WELL...

16:54.010 --> 16:55.773
MY NAME IS SHAWN SPENCER.
I AM A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

16:55.810 --> 16:58.142
THIS IS GUS.
HE'S MY BLACK CAMERON.

16:58.180 --> 16:59.670
WE ARE LEGAL CONSULTANTS

16:59.710 --> 17:01.371
ON THE JACKSON HALE
MURDER TRIAL.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.739
- WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A FEW QUESTIONS.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.645
- OH, UH, I'M ABOUT TO GO
ON THE AIR LIVE,

17:04.690 --> 17:06.112
AND I NEED TO PRACTICE THIS,

17:06.150 --> 17:07.811
SO I DON'T LOOK LIKE
A COMPLETE IDIOT.

17:07.860 --> 17:08.884
- DO YOU HAVE UNTIL 2007?

17:08.920 --> 17:10.626
[Shawn and Gus laughing]

17:10.660 --> 17:14.152
- WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH JACKSON HALE?

17:14.200 --> 17:16.327
- I ADMIRED HIM GREATLY.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.634
- BUT ISN'T IT TRUE
THAT YOU TOO

17:22.670 --> 17:24.809
WANTED TO BE A WEATHERMAN?

17:24.840 --> 17:26.865
OH, I LOVE THE WEATHER, BUT I
COULD NEVER DO WHAT HE DID.

17:26.910 --> 17:29.003
- SO YOU REALLY ENJOY
GETTING UP AT 4:00 AM.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.838
AND COVERING GOLETA SENIORS'
BAKEOFF AND POETRY JAM?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.677
- YOU KNOW, I DO,
BUT WHAT CAN I SAY?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.018
I'M A FAN OF THE ARTS.
- RUBEN?

17:36.050 --> 17:36.971
WE'RE READY.
- OKAY.

17:37.020 --> 17:38.749
- GUS.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.712
WE GOT THIS GUY.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.284
- HELLO, I'M RUBEN LEONARD,

17:42.320 --> 17:44.584
AND ALL THESE KIDS
ARE JUMPING FOR CHARITY.

17:44.630 --> 17:45.654
OH!

17:45.690 --> 17:47.157
both: OH!
- BOY!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.724
CONNIE, DID YOU SEE
THAT DIRECT HIT?

17:48.760 --> 17:49.988
- OOH!

17:50.030 --> 17:52.362
- [groans]

17:58.010 --> 17:59.898
- YOUR WITNESS,
MR. HORNSTOCK.

17:59.940 --> 18:01.373
- LET'S GO.

18:01.410 --> 18:05.346
- YOU GOING TO QUESTION HIM
OR NOT?

18:05.380 --> 18:07.348
- OH, SHAWN, MY FATHER'S HERE.
HE'S COME TO WATCH ME FAIL.

18:07.380 --> 18:08.779
- HUH?

18:08.820 --> 18:10.071
- WAIT, YOU DON'T THINK
RUBEN LEONARD

18:10.120 --> 18:11.519
HAD ANYTHING TO DO
WITH THE MURDER, DO YOU?

18:11.550 --> 18:12.915
- NOT REALLY, NO.

18:12.950 --> 18:14.656
BUT IF WE CAN GET ONE MEMBER
OF THAT JURY

18:14.690 --> 18:16.009
TO ASK THE SAME QUESTION,
WE'RE IN BUSINESS.

18:16.060 --> 18:17.425
START WITH THIS.

18:17.460 --> 18:18.927
- MR. LEONARD,

18:18.960 --> 18:21.155
YOU ARE A METEOROLOGIST,
AREN'T YOU?

18:21.200 --> 18:24.920
- I AM INDEED.
- BUT NOT ON THE AIR.

18:24.970 --> 18:25.994
- NO, NOT THUS FAR.

18:26.030 --> 18:28.737
- WELL, MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE...

18:28.770 --> 18:31.068
YOU DON'T HAVE
A METEOROLOGIST'S NAME.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.203
- I DON'T FOLLOW.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.003
- WELL, IF I WAS TO LOOK UP
THE NAME LEONARD

18:35.040 --> 18:36.439
IN, SAY, A WEATHER GLOSSARY,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.300
WOULD I SEE A DEFINITION?

18:38.350 --> 18:41.171
- NO, YOU WOULDN'T.
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

18:41.220 --> 18:43.074
- YES, MR. HORNSTOCK,
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

18:43.120 --> 18:44.917
- OH, I'M SORRY,
YOUR HONOR,

18:44.950 --> 18:47.418
IT'S JUST THAT EVERY SUCCESSFUL
WEATHERMAN THAT I KNOW

18:47.460 --> 18:49.189
HAS A REAL WEATHERMAN'S NAME.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.586
JACKSON HALE, FOR EXAMPLE.

18:51.630 --> 18:52.824
- THAT ISN'T EVEN
HIS REAL NAME.

18:52.860 --> 18:54.225
- PRECISELY!

18:54.260 --> 18:55.750
HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED
GOING BY THE NAME

18:55.800 --> 18:57.768
CUMULUS JACOTT?

18:57.800 --> 18:59.290
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- IS IT THOUGH?

18:59.330 --> 19:03.130
HOW ABOUT AURORA BOREALIS?

19:03.170 --> 19:04.762
HUMID LAZENBY?

19:04.810 --> 19:07.028
FROZEN DIAMOND DOPPLER DEWEY?

19:07.070 --> 19:09.903
- I'M JUST FINE WITH MY NAME.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.044
HURRICANE CARTER?

19:12.080 --> 19:13.047
LEIF GARRETT?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.775
HOW ABOUT BLIZZARDO?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.845
OR MAYBE TSUNAMI ALI?

19:16.880 --> 19:19.019
PUDDLES TAKAHAMA!

19:19.050 --> 19:21.985
DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HIGH TIDE!

19:22.020 --> 19:24.557
DICK ICELUGE!

19:24.590 --> 19:26.854
- I HAVE A DEGREE
IN METEOROLOGY

19:26.890 --> 19:29.029
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA,

19:29.060 --> 19:33.099
AND I WAS JUNIOR TORNADO WATCH
CAPTAIN FOR SEVEN YEARS.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.928
JACKSON HALE HAD A DEGREE
IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION

19:35.970 --> 19:40.134
FROM A JUNIOR COLLEGE
AND A MASTER'S IN GRAB-ASS!

19:40.170 --> 19:43.173
HE WAS WORTHLESS!
HE WAS WORTHLESS!

19:43.210 --> 19:45.701
AND HE WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT

19:45.750 --> 19:48.969
TO EVERY REAL METEOROLOGIST
LIKE MYSELF,

19:49.020 --> 19:50.942
AND HE SHOULD'VE BEEN STABBED
IN THE HEART A LONG TIME AGO.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.517
[crowd murmuring]

19:54.560 --> 19:56.289
- THANK YOU.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.355
- OBJECTION!

19:57.390 --> 19:58.527
- A LITTLE LATE FOR THAT.

19:58.560 --> 20:00.699
DON'T YOU THINK, COUNSELOR?

20:00.730 --> 20:02.288
- THAT'S THE KIND OF CONFIDENCE
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

20:02.330 --> 20:04.195
WE ARE ON OUR WAY
TO WINNING THIS THING.

20:04.230 --> 20:05.891
- THAT WAS AWESOME!

20:05.930 --> 20:07.192
- WHAT?

20:13.980 --> 20:15.800
- FIRST, WE MAKE NICEY-NICE
WITH RUBES,

20:15.840 --> 20:17.603
AND THEN WE FIND EVIDENCE
THAT SENDS HIM TO THE CHAIR.

20:17.650 --> 20:18.469
- BOOM.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.512
- HAPPY MONDAY, PRISCILLA.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.939
- IT'S THURSDAY.
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S TRUE.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.744
DID I MENTION THAT GUS HERE
IS SINGLE AND READY TO MINGLE?

20:25.790 --> 20:27.553
- IT'S TRUE.
- WHERE'S RUBEN?

20:27.590 --> 20:28.909
- HE'S ABOUT TO DO
THE WEATHER.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.825
HE SHOULD BE
ON THE SOUNDSTAGE BY NOW.

20:30.860 --> 20:32.350
NO, YOU CANNOT
JUST GO IN THERE.

20:32.390 --> 20:34.529
- IT'S OKAY.
WE'RE ON-AIR PERSONALITIES.

20:34.560 --> 20:37.768
THANK YOU!

20:51.310 --> 20:52.902
PROBABLY A BUCKLE.
- OH, YEAH.

20:52.950 --> 20:54.349
IT'S KINDA HEAW,
IT'S KINDA HEAW.

20:54.380 --> 20:55.938
- DOESN'T WANNA BUDGE AT ALL!

20:55.980 --> 20:59.711
[both struggling]

20:59.750 --> 21:02.514
UH-OH, GUS.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.254
- "UH-OH" WHAT?

21:10.300 --> 21:12.723
- UH-OH, RUBEN.

21:12.770 --> 21:14.294
UH-OH.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.069
- THIS BETTER BE GOOD, SPENCER.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.533
- TRUST ME, LASSIE,
THIS WAS WELL WORTH THE TRIP.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.265
- SEAN?
- DAD?

21:19.310 --> 21:21.175
- GET OVER HERE NOW.

21:21.210 --> 21:23.075
- HE'S PROBABLY LOST.
HA.

21:23.110 --> 21:25.408
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND,
YOU GUYS.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.543
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:27.580 --> 21:29.047
- NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
AT SUN UP SANTA BARBARA,

21:29.080 --> 21:30.945
MAKING AN ASS
OUT OF YOURSELF?

21:30.990 --> 21:32.946
WHAT, DO YOU GUYS THINK
YOU'RE LAWYERS NOW?

21:32.990 --> 21:34.753
- YEAH, MINUS THE LAW DEGREE
AND WHATEVER ELSE IS REQUIRED.

21:34.790 --> 21:37.258
NOTE TO SELF, THAT WOULD MAKE
A HECK OF A TV SHOW.

21:37.290 --> 21:38.826
- THAT IS MY NAME YOU'RE
THROWING AROUND OUT THERE,

21:38.860 --> 21:40.054
AND I'VE GOT A REPUTATION
IN THIS TOWN.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.352
- WOULD YOU RELAX?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.992
WE ARE DOING
WHATEVER WE HAVE TO DO

21:43.030 --> 21:44.463
TO FIND OUT WHO REALLY KILLED
JACKSON HALE.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.990
- SPENCER,
I DON'T HAVE ALL DAY.

21:46.030 --> 21:48.089
- I'M SPEAKING WITH MY MAKER.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.232
- FINE.

21:49.270 --> 21:51.135
THIS IS NOT SOME SILLY GAME,

21:51.170 --> 21:53.900
AND YOU BETTER NOT TREAT IT
LIKE ONE.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.805
- I'M DOING MY DAMNEDEST HERE
TO MAKE YOU PROUD

21:55.840 --> 21:59.298
IN AS SUBDUED AND CIVILIZED
MANNER AS I KNOW HOW.

21:59.350 --> 22:01.147
AI-TER ALL...

22:01.180 --> 22:05.116
WHO TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW?

22:05.150 --> 22:08.017
- OKAY, THANKS.
1--

22:08.060 --> 22:09.857
I APPRECIATE THAT.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.983
- GOOD TALK, POP.

22:12.030 --> 22:13.952
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.425
PSYCHIC VISION TIME, BABY!

22:18.470 --> 22:20.529
I AM SENSING THAT RUBEN LEONARD
HATED JACKSON HALE

22:20.570 --> 22:22.492
BECAUSE HE WAS
AN UNTOUCHABLE WEATHERMAN

22:22.540 --> 22:26.533
WHO LIKED TO BE TOUCHED
BY THE LA-LA-LA-LADIES.

22:26.570 --> 22:28.902
- RUBEN KNEW HE WOULD NEVER
GET A CHANCE TO BE WEATHERMAN

22:28.940 --> 22:30.840
AS LONG AS JACKSON
WAS STILL AROUND.

22:32.110 --> 22:33.611
AT THE STATION

22:33.650 --> 22:36.244
ON THE NIGHT
THAT HE WAS PUMPERNICKELING

22:36.280 --> 22:37.986
SANDRA PANITCH.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.817
AND THAT...

22:39.850 --> 22:43.217
IS WHEN HE KILLED HIM...
IN COLD BLOOD.

22:43.260 --> 22:45.626
- THAT IS EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT
KIND OF STUFF THERE, SPENCER,

22:45.660 --> 22:47.890
BUT YOU HAVE NO EVIDENCE.

22:49.700 --> 22:50.792
[thump]

22:53.370 --> 22:54.894
- [gaSPSJ

22:56.570 --> 22:58.299
- IS THAT THE MURDER WEAPON?

22:58.340 --> 23:00.103
- [inhales]
- WHERE'S RUBEN NOW?

23:00.140 --> 23:02.131
- HE'S GETTING READY
TO DO THE WEATHER.

23:02.180 --> 23:04.102
- CRAP!

23:06.280 --> 23:09.647
- SO, SANTA BARBARA,
IF YOU'VE GOT--

23:14.060 --> 23:17.484
LIKE I WAS SAYING,
IF YOU'VE GOT, UM, BIG PLANS

23:17.530 --> 23:20.749
THIS WEEKEND,
KEEP THOSE FINGERS CROSSED...

23:20.800 --> 23:23.223
'CAUSE RAIN...

23:23.260 --> 23:26.320
IT'S COMING.

23:26.370 --> 23:28.065
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

23:28.100 --> 23:31.308
- THE GUILT
IS EATING HIM ALIVE.

23:31.340 --> 23:33.501
- STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.508
IT'S ALL LIES.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.098
- HE'S GONNA MAKE
A RUN FOR IT.

23:37.140 --> 23:38.300
HE CAN'T MAKE A RUN FOR IT,
CAN HE?

23:38.350 --> 23:39.908
- NO WAY.
I DON'T THINK SO.

23:39.950 --> 23:41.417
- I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE IS LIES.

23:41.450 --> 23:44.180
TH ESE ACCUSATIONS
THAT I KILLED JACKSON HALE.

23:44.220 --> 23:45.812
[coughing]
LIES!

23:45.850 --> 23:47.408
- SHOULD I DO SOMETHING?
- LIES!

23:47.460 --> 23:48.984
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU GONNA DO?

23:49.020 --> 23:51.022
- I DID NOT KILL
THAT SILVER-HEADED MAN-SLUT.

23:51.060 --> 23:52.880
[coughing]
- SURE, YOU DIDN'T.

23:52.930 --> 23:54.454
- AND NEITHER
DID SANDRA PANITCH.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.559
[panﬁng]

23:56.600 --> 24:00.468
BUT I'LL TELL YOU--
I'LL TELL YOU WHO DID DO IT.

24:03.840 --> 24:04.966
[both gasp]

24:05.010 --> 24:07.035
OOF.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.708
[all murmuring]

24:08.740 --> 24:10.708
- UM, WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.812
- ALL RIGHT, THERE'S ONE THING
HERE WE KNOW FOR CERTAIN.

24:18.850 --> 24:21.182
- THIS PROVES
THAT SANDRA ISN'T OUR KILLER.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.517
- GUS IS RIGHT.
SHE'S IN CUSTODY.

24:22.560 --> 24:23.925
NO WAY SHE COULD'VE
POISONED RUBEN.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.279
- SLOW YOUR ROLL THERE,
DETECTIVE.

24:25.330 --> 24:26.627
WE DON'T KNOW THAT RUBEN
WAS POISONED.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.525
FOR ALL WE KNOW,
THIS MAN DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.028
- ALL I KNOW IS THAT JACKSON
HAD A LOT OF GIRLFRIENDS.

24:31.070 --> 24:33.368
HA, AND TRUST ME,
I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE,

24:33.400 --> 24:34.765
YOU CAN'T
KEEP THEM ALL HAPPY.

24:34.800 --> 24:35.835
[laughing]

24:35.870 --> 24:37.337
YOU FEEL ME?
[laughing]

24:37.370 --> 24:39.338
ANYONE?
AMEN.

24:39.370 --> 24:42.271
[laughing]

24:42.310 --> 24:43.641
- GUS JUST MADE US ALL
FEEL VERY AWKWARD,

24:43.680 --> 24:45.500
BUT HE COULD BE RIGHT.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.199
MAYBE WE SHOULD BE
LOOKING AT ALL THE OTHER WOMEN

24:47.250 --> 24:48.410
THAT JACKSON WAS--

24:48.450 --> 24:50.782
- HI.

24:50.820 --> 24:54.654
- DID I MENTION THAT GUS HERE
IS SINGLE AND READY TO MINGLE?

24:54.690 --> 24:56.885
DUDE, YOU WERE DEAD WRONG.

24:56.920 --> 24:58.285
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING
AT THE ONE WOMAN

24:58.330 --> 25:00.286
THAT JACKSON WASN'T HALING ON.
- WHAT?

25:00.330 --> 25:02.753
- THE ONE GAL HE WASN'T PLAYING
"PANTS OFF, DANCE OFF" WITH.

25:02.800 --> 25:03.721
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
SHAWN?

25:03.770 --> 25:05.260
- CALL HORNSTOCK AND TELL HIM

25:05.300 --> 25:07.461
WE WANNA MOVE PRISCILLA

25:07.500 --> 25:11.106
TO THE TOP
OF THE WITNESS LIST.

25:13.510 --> 25:16.229
- PRISCILLA,
ISN'T IT TRUE

25:16.280 --> 25:20.000
THAT YOU PINED
FOR JACKSON HALE?

25:20.050 --> 25:21.415
- [clears throat]
NO.

25:21.450 --> 25:23.008
- REALLY CHAPPED YOUR CHASSIS

25:23.050 --> 25:25.041
THAT HE LIKED A LOT OF WOMEN
BUT NOT YOU.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.512
- OBJECT ION.
LEADING.

25:26.550 --> 25:28.256
- OVERRULED.

25:28.290 --> 25:29.757
- MADE YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU WEREN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.655
- NO.

25:31.690 --> 25:34.193
- AND JACKSON HALE WASN'T
VERY PICKY EITHER, WAS HE?

25:34.230 --> 25:37.290
AND THAT JUST DROVE YOU NUTS,
DIDN'T IT?

25:37.330 --> 25:39.560
- NO.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.739
- [sighs]

25:41.770 --> 25:43.965
- TALK ABOUT HIS HAIR OR THE WAY
HE SMELLED OR SOMETHING.

25:44.010 --> 25:46.069
[slams table]
- PRISCILLA!

25:46.110 --> 25:48.578
JACKSON HALE'S SILVER LOCKS
REALLY REWED YOUR ENGINE,

25:48.610 --> 25:50.908
DIDN'T THEY?
AND YOU...

25:50.950 --> 25:53.714
WANTED TO BE
THE LONE LADY OF HIS DESIRES.

25:53.750 --> 25:56.310
BUT HE ACTED LIKE
YOU WEREN'T A HUMAN PERSON

25:56.350 --> 25:58.147
WITH FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS

25:58.190 --> 26:01.250
AND PASSIONS AND DREAMS
AND LOTS OF LOVE IN YOUR HEART.

26:01.290 --> 26:03.554
YOU HAVE SO MUCH TO GIVE,

26:03.590 --> 26:05.649
AND JACKSON HALE
WAS JUST TOO FOOLISH

26:05.690 --> 26:07.999
TO SEE HOW AMAZING YOU ARE

26:08.030 --> 26:09.497
AND WHAT LIFE
COULD'VE BEEN LIKE

26:09.530 --> 26:12.522
IF HE HAD TAKEN
A CHANCE ON YOU

26:12.570 --> 26:15.289
INSTEAD OF ALL THOSE
OTHER LADIES WITH FLAMING EAGLES

26:15.340 --> 26:17.262
TATTOOED
JUST ABOVE THEIR SEAT CUSHION!

26:17.300 --> 26:18.938
- YES! YES! YES!

26:18.970 --> 26:20.369
[all gasp]

26:20.410 --> 26:22.173
I WAS HIS DREAM GIRL.
I WAS!

26:22.210 --> 26:26.271
WHAT ELSE DID I HAVE TO DO
TO SHOW HIM I WAS THE ONE?

26:26.310 --> 26:29.677
THE ONE!

26:29.720 --> 26:32.644
- PROSECUTION REQUESTS A RECESS,
FRANKLY, TO REGROUP.

26:32.690 --> 26:34.317
- YEAH, THEY DO.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.214
- I THINK
THAT THE PROSECUTION

26:36.260 --> 26:38.455
SHOULD DISMISS
ALL THE CHARGES, YOUR HONOR.

26:38.490 --> 26:41.391
- BOTH COUNSELS
APPROACH THE BENCH.

26:41.430 --> 26:45.161
- TOUGH BREAK, PHELPSY.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.464
[clears throat]

26:47.500 --> 26:50.594
- GET YOUR BONEY ELBOWS
OFF MY BENCH.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.403
- YES, SIR.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.705
JUDGE, WHAT WE WERE THINKING
IS MAYBE, UH, 250 GRAND

26:55.740 --> 26:57.332
WOULD BE ENOUGH
TO MAKE THIS GO AWAY, YEAH?

26:57.380 --> 26:58.472
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS,
SHAWN.

26:58.510 --> 26:59.579
- HOW ABOUT...
- HEY!

26:59.610 --> 27:00.645
- GIFT CARDS?
- OBJECT ION!

27:00.680 --> 27:01.977
UH, WHISPERING TO THE WITNESS.

27:02.020 --> 27:03.544
- YEAH, WHAT--
- MR. PHELPS...

27:03.580 --> 27:05.184
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE
IN CONTEMPT?

27:05.220 --> 27:06.915
- NO, JUDGE.

27:06.950 --> 27:08.611
BUT THERE WILL BE NO DROPPING
OF ANY CHARGES

27:08.660 --> 27:10.457
BECAUSE PRISCILLA
DIDN'T DO IT.

27:10.490 --> 27:11.923
- YEAH, SURE, SHE DIDN'T.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.825
- ARE YOU READY TO GO THERE?
- YEAH.

27:13.860 --> 27:16.454
- THE PROSECUTION IS READY
TO QUESTION THE WITNESS.

27:16.500 --> 27:18.661
- IT'S YOUR FUNERAL, PHELPSY.
- OKAY.

27:18.700 --> 27:20.861
- PRISCILLA, ISN'T IT TRUE

27:20.900 --> 27:22.367
THAT YOU WERE AT
THE SANTA BAR-BAR-BARA PUB

27:22.400 --> 27:23.901
THE NIGHT
OF JACKSON HALE'S MURDER?

27:23.940 --> 27:25.305
- YES.

27:25.340 --> 27:27.706
- AND IS THERE SOMEONE
WHO COULD VOUCH

27:27.740 --> 27:30.072
FOR YOUR WHEREABOUTS
THE ENTIRE NIGHT?

27:30.110 --> 27:33.341
- YEP.

27:35.480 --> 27:36.742
- MR. STRODE, COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THE COURT WHERE YOU WERE

27:36.780 --> 27:38.509
THE EVENING OF MARCH 5TH?

27:38.550 --> 27:40.415
- UH,
THE SANTA BAR-BAR-BARA PUB,

27:40.450 --> 27:43.010
LOOKING FOR THE PERSON
WHO SLIPPED A MICKEY

27:43.060 --> 27:44.220
INTO MY SLOE GIN FIZZ
THE WEEK BEFORE.

27:44.260 --> 27:45.852
- I SEE.

27:45.890 --> 27:47.448
- THAT WAS THE BEST MICKEY
I'VE EVER BEEN SLIPPED.

27:47.490 --> 27:49.526
I GOTTA FIND THAT GUY
AND THANK HIM.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.892
- MR. STRODE,
DID YOU MEET ANYONE

27:51.930 --> 27:53.420
ON THAT NIGHT IN QUESTION?

27:53.470 --> 27:54.698
- OH, YES.

27:54.740 --> 27:56.765
HOPEFULLY MY FUTURE BRIDE.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.337
AND WHERE DID THAT NIGHT
TAKE YOU EXACTLY?

27:59.370 --> 28:00.598
- TO MY AIRSTREAM
FOR SOMETHING

28:00.640 --> 28:03.438
THE LOCALS
Ol-TEN REFER TO AS "SEX."

28:03.480 --> 28:05.004
- FANTASTIC.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.199
- [laughing]
IT WAS.

28:06.250 --> 28:07.672
- NOW, MR. STRODE,

28:07.720 --> 28:11.212
CAN YOU POINT TO THAT LADY
HERE TODAY?

28:11.250 --> 28:15.482
- I BELIEVE I CAN.

28:15.520 --> 28:16.953
- PLEASE NOTE THE WITNESS
IS POINTING

28:16.990 --> 28:19.026
TO PRISCILLA MORGENSTERN.

28:19.060 --> 28:21.255
- [groans]
- SHE STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.689
WHICH IS RARE FOR ME.
SLEPT LIKE AN ANGEL.

28:23.730 --> 28:26.722
THE SHAl-T OF MORNING LIGHT
GRAZING HER BOSOM,

28:26.770 --> 28:29.091
UNTIL SHE BOLTED UPRIGHT
AND RAN TO THE BATHROOM

28:29.140 --> 28:30.664
WHERE SHE SHOWERED
THREE TIMES,

28:30.700 --> 28:32.258
BRUSHED HER TEETH
FOR ALMOST AN HOUR,

28:32.310 --> 28:35.575
AND LEI-T LIKE A BLAZE
OF BEAUTIFUL GLORY.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.475
- YOU SEE, PRISCILLA WENT
TO THE BAR THAT NIGHT

28:37.510 --> 28:39.603
TO MAKE HER MOVE
ON JACKSON

28:39.650 --> 28:42.517
AND FINALLY LET HIM KNOW
HOW SHE FELT ABOUT HIM.

28:42.550 --> 28:46.418
BUT JACKSON ALREADY
HAD HIS EYES

28:46.450 --> 28:49.248
ON HIS NEXT CONQUEST,
SANDRA PANITCH!

28:49.290 --> 28:51.485
- UH, UM, OBJECTION.
SPECULATION.

28:51.530 --> 28:52.952
- OVERRULED.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.799
- SO PRISCILLA
GOT BLEARY-EYED DRUNK

28:54.830 --> 28:57.321
WITH THIS MAN,
MR. STRODE,

28:57.360 --> 29:00.591
WHO IS LITERALLY
THE LAST GUY LEI-T IN THE BAR,

29:00.630 --> 29:02.598
AND SHE SLOPPILY MADE

29:02.640 --> 29:06.667
ONE OF THE GREATEST BEER-GOGGLE
MISTAKES OF ALL TIME.

29:06.710 --> 29:10.430
SANDRA PANITCH LEI-T THE BAR
THAT NIGHT WITH JACKSON HALE

29:10.480 --> 29:12.607
AND KILLED HIM
IN COLD BLOOD.

29:12.650 --> 29:16.142
THE EVIDENCE SAYS
THAT IT IS SO!

29:16.180 --> 29:19.741
IS THIS--IS THIS IT?
- HERE YOU GO.

29:19.790 --> 29:20.814
- [grunts]

29:20.860 --> 29:22.714
- WHAT'S ON THE TAPE?

29:22.760 --> 29:23.954
- WHAT'S ON THE TAPE?
- WHAT'S ON THE TAPE?

29:23.990 --> 29:25.389
- WHAT'S ON THE--

29:25.430 --> 29:27.489
- YOUR HONOR,
THE PROSECUTION

29:27.530 --> 29:29.794
WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT
SOME NEW EVIDENCE.

29:29.830 --> 29:31.661
YOU SEE, THE HEAD TV TECHNICIAN
AT THE STATION

29:31.700 --> 29:33.861
HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETRIEVE
A BACKUP COPY

29:33.900 --> 29:35.891
OF THE VIDEO FOOTAGE
FROM THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER

29:35.940 --> 29:38.602
OFF HIS HARD DRIVE
AND ONTO THIS VHS.

29:38.640 --> 29:41.905
THIS TAPE, PEOPLE,
RIGHT HERE...

29:41.940 --> 29:44.306
TELLS THE STORY

29:44.350 --> 29:47.069
AND IS THE FINAL NAIL

29:47.110 --> 29:52.047
IN SANDRA PANITCH'S COFFIN.

29:53.820 --> 29:55.583
- SO THIS IS
WHERE THE NEWS HAPPENS?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.713
- OH, FORGET ABOUT THE NEWS.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.923
THIS IS ALL ABOEJ); THE WEATHER.

30:09.670 --> 30:13.800
[stabbing, man screaming]

30:17.340 --> 30:19.240
- HORNSTOCK.

30:19.280 --> 30:22.340
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU'RE READY
TO PLEA TO MURDER TWO.

30:29.720 --> 30:31.278
- SANDRA, THE BEST ADVICE
I CAN GIVE YOU AS A LAWYER

30:31.330 --> 30:32.854
IS TO TAKE THE PLEA.

30:32.890 --> 30:35.620
- SHAWN, IF IT WERE YOU,
AND YOU DIDN'T DO IT,

30:35.660 --> 30:36.854
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

30:36.900 --> 30:40.893
- LOOK, SANDRA...

30:40.940 --> 30:42.669
- DON'T FILL HER HEAD
WITH FALSE HOPES.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.634
SHE'S LOOKING AT LIFE.
TAKE THE PLEA.

30:44.670 --> 30:46.262
- LIFE?
- DO NOT TAKE THE PLEA!

30:46.310 --> 30:47.538
HORNSTOCK,
GET BACK IN THERE.

30:47.570 --> 30:48.776
BUY US ANOTHER HOUR
WITH THE JUDGE.

30:48.810 --> 30:51.472
PLEASE.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.842
SANDRA, DON'T WORRY, OKAY?
I'M GONNA FIND SOMETHING.

30:53.880 --> 30:55.370
SOMEWHERE.

30:55.420 --> 30:58.412
YOU HAVE
MY HAND-TO-HEAD PROMISE.

31:04.260 --> 31:06.182
I GOT NOTHING.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.686
- THE ONLY PROBLEM
IS HORNSTOCK

31:07.730 --> 31:09.425
IS DUE BACK IN COURT
ANY MINUTE NOW.

31:09.460 --> 31:10.597
- THERE'S GOTTA BE
A HIDDEN CLUE SOMEWHERE.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.063
GO DOWN THERE AND STALL!

31:12.100 --> 31:13.169
- I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT, SHAWN.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.690
- YOU ARE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY,

31:14.740 --> 31:16.492
AND THIS IS YOUR TIME TO KILL.
NOW, GO!

31:16.540 --> 31:17.962
- MAN!

31:18.010 --> 31:21.173
- KEEP YOUR SHIRT ON THOUGH.

31:21.210 --> 31:23.030
COME ON.

31:23.080 --> 31:26.004
- MY PATIENCE
IS RUNNING THINNER, COUNSELOR.

31:26.050 --> 31:28.314
IF YOUR CONSULTANTS
DON'T SHOW UP HERE SOON,

31:28.350 --> 31:30.568
I'M GOING TO SEND THIS JURY OFF
FOR DELIBERATIONS.

31:30.620 --> 31:32.679
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, SIR, I--

31:32.720 --> 31:35.052
I REALLY DON'T--
- WHY ARE YOU FIDGETING?

31:35.090 --> 31:37.308
- OH, I DID HAVE, UM, A LITTLE
ISSUE DURING THE BREAK, SIR,

31:37.360 --> 31:39.089
BUT I CLEARED IT UP
WITH A MYLANTA.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.950
- YOUR HONOR,
THE STATE IS STILL WILLING

31:41.000 --> 31:42.422
TO ACCEPT THE PLEA.

31:42.460 --> 31:43.961
OBVIOUSLY COUNSEL
IS CRUMBLING.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.763
AND FRANKLY,
IT'S HARD TO WATCH.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.394
- AH, WELL,
HERE COMES ONE OF THEM.

31:48.440 --> 31:49.634
- HOW'D SHAWN DO?
- NOTHING.

31:49.670 --> 31:50.830
HE'S STILL ON IT.
- WHAT? NO!

31:50.870 --> 31:52.906
NO, IT'S TOO LATE!

31:52.940 --> 31:55.374
I DON'T HAVE ANY WITNESSES.
I DON'T HAVE ANY MOTIONS.

31:55.410 --> 31:58.470
SANDRA...
I'M SORRY.

32:11.990 --> 32:13.480
- I GOT IT.

32:13.530 --> 32:16.351
[phone vibrates]

32:18.200 --> 32:20.566
- YOUR HONOR,
AT THIS JUNCTURE, I--

32:20.600 --> 32:22.898
- NOT JUST YET, YOUR HONOR.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.135
IF I MAY,
I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COURT.

32:25.170 --> 32:28.571
- OBJECTION. THIS MAN
CANNOT ADDRESS ANY COURT.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.168
- YOUNG MAN, HAVE YOU EVER
ATTENDED A LAW SCHOOL?

32:30.210 --> 32:32.075
- JUST MS. FINKELMAN'S
SIXTH-GRADE CLASS, SIR,

32:32.110 --> 32:34.010
"ME, YOU, AND THE LAW."

32:34.050 --> 32:35.972
- WELL,
IT IS UNDER MY DISCRETION

32:36.020 --> 32:38.909
TO ALLOW ANY TESTIMONY
THAT MAY SPEAK TO THE TRUTH

32:38.950 --> 32:42.056
IN THIS CASE--
TINY LEASH. GO.

32:42.090 --> 32:45.389
- OH, UH--
[clears throat]

32:45.430 --> 32:46.749
THANK YOU, SIR.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.929
UH, EXCUSE ME.
[clears throat]

32:48.960 --> 32:50.791
EXCUSE ME.

32:50.830 --> 32:51.865
EXCUSE ME.
[clears throat]

32:51.900 --> 32:53.367
EXCUSE ME.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.628
I WOULD LIKE TO, UH,
JUST, UH---

32:54.670 --> 32:56.638
- JUST WHAT?
SPEAK!

32:56.670 --> 32:59.639
- EXCUSE ME, SIR,
BUT YOU ARE BEING RUDE.

32:59.670 --> 33:01.001
IS IT BECAUSE I'M A YUTE?

33:01.040 --> 33:02.837
- A WHAT?
- WHAT'S A YUTE?

33:02.880 --> 33:05.405
- OH, A YUTE, A YUTE.
IT'S A YOUTH.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.247
IT'S FROM MY COUSIN VINNY.
TERRIFIC FILM, SIR.

33:07.280 --> 33:10.078
- OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
IT'S OKAY, DECENT AT BEST.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.917
- I DON'T CARE WHAT COUSIN
IT'S COMING FROM.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.679
I'M ABOUT TO HOLD YOU TWO
IN CONTEMPT.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.450
- SO THE PLEA BARGAIN
IS JUST OUT?

33:16.490 --> 33:17.787
[phone vibrates]
WE CAN'T GO BACK NOW

33:17.820 --> 33:19.378
AND GET THE--

33:19.430 --> 33:20.522
DO SOMETHING.

33:20.560 --> 33:24.997
- UH...

33:25.030 --> 33:28.158
TH EY--THEY--
THEY BEAT UP ON A WEAKLING.

33:28.200 --> 33:31.465
THE REST IS JUST SMOKE-FILLED,
COFFEEHOUSE CRAP!

33:31.510 --> 33:34.570
THEY TORTURED AND TORMENTED
A WEAKER KID, AND WHY?

33:34.610 --> 33:36.475
BECAUSE HE COULDN'T RUN
VERY FAST.

33:36.510 --> 33:37.602
- A FEW GOOD MEN!
- EXACTLY.

33:37.640 --> 33:39.107
- I'M WARNING YOU.

33:39.150 --> 33:40.708
- YOU THINK YOU HAVE A MONOPOLY
ON THE TRUTH?

33:40.750 --> 33:42.741
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.
YOU ARE IN CONTEMPT.

33:44.350 --> 33:46.386
YOU NEED ME ON THAT WALL.

33:46.420 --> 33:48.012
[gavelbangs]
-ENOUGH!

33:48.060 --> 33:51.826
BAILIFF, PLEASE REMAND
THIS YUTE INTO CUSTODY.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.521
- COME ON, SON.

33:53.560 --> 33:55.198
- DON'T YOU
"COME ON, SON" ME.

33:55.230 --> 33:58.688
I AM A LAWYER AND AN OFFICER
IN THE UNITED STATES NAW.

33:58.730 --> 34:01.164
AND YOU, SIR,
ARE UNDER ARREST,

34:01.200 --> 34:03.395
YOU SON OF A BITCH.

34:03.440 --> 34:04.532
- HEY.

34:04.570 --> 34:06.208
DO BONFIRE.

34:06.240 --> 34:07.764
- WHAT DOES IT MATTER
THE COLOR OF A MAN'S SKIN

34:07.810 --> 34:09.971
IF MEN OF THE CLOTH,
MEN OF GOD

34:10.010 --> 34:11.773
TAKE THE PRIME CUTS?

34:11.810 --> 34:12.970
- I LIKED THAT ONE.
- ME TOO.

34:13.010 --> 34:14.819
I HOPE THEY DON'T REMAKE IT.

34:14.850 --> 34:17.045
DR. TOWLER TOLD ME
TO CHANGE THE FORM.

34:17.080 --> 34:19.583
HE TOLD ME TO CHANGE THE "1"
TO A "9."

34:19.620 --> 34:22.851
HE SAID I'D NEVER WORK AGAIN.
WHO WERE THESE MEN?

34:22.890 --> 34:24.323
WHO WERE THESE MEN?

34:24.360 --> 34:25.952
I WANTED TO BE A NURSE!

34:25.990 --> 34:29.153
[fake crying]

34:29.200 --> 34:31.464
- YO, WHAT WAS THAT LAST ONE?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.092
- THE VERDICT.
PAUL NEWMAN.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.030
- NEVER SAW IT, BUT I LIKE
THAT DUDE'S POPCORN.

34:35.070 --> 34:36.992
- SHAWN, I DID IT!
I DID IT!

34:37.040 --> 34:39.964
- GOOD JOB, BUDDY.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM HERE.

34:40.010 --> 34:41.637
- [struggling]

34:44.150 --> 34:45.799
- MISS ME?

34:45.850 --> 34:46.976
HEY, JULES.

34:47.010 --> 34:48.944
- [sneezes]
- BLESS YOU.

34:48.980 --> 34:50.709
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE COURT,

34:50.750 --> 34:54.652
JUROR NUMBER FIVE,
AND THE HONORABLE JUDGE H. LEES,

34:54.690 --> 34:56.555
THE DEFENSE WOULD LIKE TO CALL
TO THE STAND

34:56.590 --> 34:58.649
MR. MORTIMER CAMP.

34:58.690 --> 34:59.987
- OBJECTION!

35:00.030 --> 35:01.395
MR. CAMP IS NOT ON TRIAL HERE,

35:01.430 --> 35:04.024
AND A PSYCHIC
CANNOT SPEAK TO WITNESSES.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.721
- JUDGE, I NOW HAVE EVIDENCE

35:05.770 --> 35:07.089
THAT WILL SHINE A SHOCKING

35:07.130 --> 35:10.566
AND VIBRANT LIGHT
ON THIS CASE.

35:10.600 --> 35:12.636
- YOUR HONOR,
AI-TER WHAT WE JUST SAW,

35:12.670 --> 35:14.206
YOU COULDN'T POSSIBLY
ALLOW THIS.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.505
- YOUR HONOR!

35:20.310 --> 35:22.949
MR. CAMP,
YOUR WIFE WANTED A DIVORCE.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.789
YOU DID NOT.
TRUE?

35:24.820 --> 35:27.345
- SHE WAS UNHAPPY.
I UNDERSTOOD.

35:27.390 --> 35:29.187
- SOMETIMES THINGS
ARE A LOT MORE ONE-SIDED

35:29.220 --> 35:31.825
THAN WE WOULD LIKE THEM TO BE,
AREN'T THEY, MR. CAMP?

35:31.860 --> 35:36.422
FOR EXAMPLE, I CAN RELATE
BECAUSE I'M A PSYCHIC.

35:36.460 --> 35:38.928
WHICH MEANS LOVE
IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR ME

35:38.970 --> 35:40.722
THAN IT IS FOR YOU.

35:40.770 --> 35:44.092
BUT THERE IS A WOMAN
IN THIS COURTROOM RIGHT NOW,

35:44.140 --> 35:46.108
A LITTLE SLICE
OF BLONDE PERFECTION,

35:46.140 --> 35:48.131
A PERFECT LY FORMED BEIGNET

35:48.180 --> 35:50.774
LIGHTLY DUSTED
WITH POWDERED SUGAR

35:50.810 --> 35:52.675
AND A BADGE.

35:52.710 --> 35:54.211
THE FIRST TIME
THAT I SAW HER,

35:54.250 --> 35:56.741
I HAD A VISION
THAT WE WOULD BE MARRIED,

35:56.780 --> 36:00.318
AND WE WOULD HAVE
SO MANY KIDS

36:00.350 --> 36:02.250
THAT MOST OF THEM WOULD HAVE
TO BE PUT UP FOR ADOPTION.

36:02.290 --> 36:05.657
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING
WITH THIS, MR. SPENCER?

36:05.690 --> 36:07.021
- JUDGE, I CAN'T ANSWER
THAT QUESTION FOR YOU.

36:07.060 --> 36:08.322
I MEAN, WE WORK TOGETHER.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.191
IT'D BE LIKE THE TWO OF YOU

36:10.230 --> 36:12.266
HAVING A CONNECTION
AND WONDERING IF IT'S REAL OR...

36:12.300 --> 36:14.165
- [sighs]
- IS IT REAL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

36:14.200 --> 36:17.658
YOU DON'T.

36:17.700 --> 36:20.533
MR. CAMP, YOU COULDN'T
MAKE YOUR WIFE LOVE YOU,

36:20.570 --> 36:22.879
SO THAT MADE YOU
EVEN MORE JEALOUS, DIDN'T IT?

36:22.910 --> 36:24.377
- NO MORE JEALOUS
THAN ANY OTHER MAN WOULD BE

36:24.410 --> 36:25.707
IN THE SAME POSITION.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.048
- SHE WAS LYING TO YOU!

36:28.080 --> 36:31.345
SHE TOLD YOU SHE WAS TAKING
TENNIS LESSONS Al-TER WORK.

36:31.390 --> 36:33.688
DID YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

36:33.720 --> 36:35.358
- OF COURSE I DID.
SHE'S MY WIFE.

36:35.390 --> 36:37.255
I MEAN, LOOK, I KNOW I'M
A REALLY GOOD-LOOKING NEWSCASTER

36:37.290 --> 36:39.554
AND I COULD AARON ECKHART
MY WAY AROUND TOWN IF I--

36:39.590 --> 36:41.228
- NO, NO, NOT AARON ECKHART.

36:41.260 --> 36:43.797
- I COULD PATRICK WILSON
MY WAY AROUND TOWN.

36:43.830 --> 36:45.263
- BETTER.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.292
- YOU WERE DECEIVED!

36:48.340 --> 36:50.558
HERE'S THE IRONY--
SHE WAS ACTUALLY

36:50.600 --> 36:52.500
GOING TO SEE
A MARRIAGE THERAPIST INSTEAD.

36:52.540 --> 36:55.429
- YOUR TENNIS LESSON'S
BEEN CHANGED TO 5:00 P.M. TODAY.

36:55.480 --> 36:59.769
- SHE WAS SEEING DR. ROSEN,
THE MARRIAGE THERAPIST, INSTEAD,

36:59.810 --> 37:01.209
AND IF SHE'D
ONLY TOLD YOU THAT,

37:01.250 --> 37:03.115
PERHAPS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN MATTERS

37:03.150 --> 37:05.983
INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.

37:06.020 --> 37:08.147
- YOU WERE CONVINCED THAT SHE
WAS CHEATING ON YOU WITH HALE,

37:08.190 --> 37:10.511
SO YOU DECIDED TO CATCH THEM
IN THE ACT.

37:17.230 --> 37:19.198
ON THE SET...

37:19.230 --> 37:22.734
'CAUSE YOU KNEW JACKSON
LIKED TO TAKE HIS LADIES THERE

37:22.770 --> 37:26.866
TO SEDUCE THEM,
TO...

37:26.910 --> 37:28.468
FILM HIS TRYSTS.

37:28.510 --> 37:31.138
- I GUESS SOME GIRLS
ARE TURNED ON BY A WEATHER SET.

37:31.180 --> 37:33.102
- YOU HEARD JACKSON ENTER
THAT NIGHT.

37:33.150 --> 37:35.015
IT WAS DARK, SHADOWY.

37:35.050 --> 37:37.371
YOU PREMEDITATED THIS MURDER,

37:37.420 --> 37:39.718
BUT YOU WERE CONVINCED
IT WAS YOUR WIFE.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.854
AND YOU KNEW HE'D BRING HER BACK
TO THE STUDIO

37:41.890 --> 37:43.755
WHERE HE SECRETLY FILMS
HIS TRYSTS.

37:43.790 --> 37:46.054
USING THE TECHNICIAN'S
GREEN SCREEN SUIT,

37:46.090 --> 37:47.751
YOU KNEW
YOU'D REMAIN UNDETECTED.

37:47.790 --> 37:50.020
YOU WAITED FOR THEM
TO DROP OUT OF FRAME--

37:50.060 --> 37:51.925
- AND YOU KNOCKED
THAT POOR GIRL OUT COLD

37:51.970 --> 37:53.824
AND STABBED YOU
SOME JACKSON HALE.

37:53.870 --> 37:56.236
- THEN YOU NOTICED
IT WASN'T CONNIE AT ALL,

37:56.270 --> 37:58.135
IT WAS MY CLIENT
SANDRA PANITCH,

37:58.170 --> 38:00.331
AN INNOCENT GIRL WHO WALKED
INTO A DEADLY LOVE TRIANGLE.

38:00.370 --> 38:02.770
- I DID, I DID.
I WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.

38:02.810 --> 38:04.277
BUT I HAD ONE DRINK,

38:04.310 --> 38:05.948
AND YOU KNOW,
MY FRIENDS WERE TEASING ME

38:05.980 --> 38:07.447
BECAUSE I NEVER HAD
A ONE-NIGHT STAND.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.970
SO I THOUGHT, LIKE,
OH, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT.

38:09.020 --> 38:10.749
MAYBE I SHOULD DO IT.
- SANDY, SHH, SHH.

38:10.780 --> 38:14.147
- AND HIS TEETH WERE SO WHITE,
AND HIS HAIR WAS SHIN--

38:14.190 --> 38:16.249
- SINCE JACKSON HALE
WAS NOT SLEEPING WITH YOUR WIFE,

38:16.290 --> 38:18.451
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD STILL
PUT YOUR MARRIAGE BACK TOGETHER.

38:18.490 --> 38:20.481
- AND YOU TRIED
TO PIN IT ON SANDRA PANITCH.

38:20.530 --> 38:23.522
- AND YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD GET
AWAY WITH FIRST-DEGREE MURDER.

38:23.560 --> 38:26.028
- THAT IS
A COMPELLING COURTROOM DRAMA

38:26.070 --> 38:28.595
YOU'VE WRITTEN THERE.
GOOD LUCK PROVING IT.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.733
- OH, WE'RE ABOUT To PROVE IT...
[glggleSJ

38:30.770 --> 38:33.739
RIGHT NOW.

38:33.770 --> 38:36.000
OFFICER,
THE MONITOR, PLEASE.

38:38.240 --> 38:40.447
I PRESENT--

38:40.480 --> 38:42.209
- SO THIS IS
WHERE THE NEWS HAPPENS?

38:42.250 --> 38:43.945
- OH, FORGET ABOUT THE NEWS.

38:43.980 --> 38:45.117
THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE WEATHER.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.118
- THIS PROVES NOTHING.

38:47.150 --> 38:50.017
I'M NOT THERE.
[laughing] I'M NOT THERE.

38:50.060 --> 38:52.187
- MR. SPENCER,
I SEE NO EVIDENCE OF MR. CAMP

38:52.230 --> 38:53.481
IN THIS VIDEO AT ALL.

38:53.530 --> 38:55.191
- PRECISELY, JUDGE.

38:55.230 --> 38:58.097
YOU SEE, MR. CAMP WORE
A GREEN SUIT THAT NIGHT.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.018
HE KNEW WE WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO SEE HIM ON THIS TAPE,

39:00.070 --> 39:01.992
BECAUSE HE KNEW
HIS GREEN SUIT

39:02.040 --> 39:05.862
WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE IN FRONT
OF THE GREEN SCREEN BACKGROUND.

39:05.910 --> 39:07.662
BUT HIS PINKIE WOULD.

39:07.710 --> 39:09.200
- WHAT IS HE EVEN
TALKING ABOUT?

39:09.240 --> 39:10.468
- LOOK, THERE YOU ARE,
STANDING UP,

39:10.510 --> 39:12.307
STILL INVISIBLE
AFTER THE DIRTY DEED.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.944
BUT THERE'S ONE THING
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

39:14.980 --> 39:17.175
ALL OF YOUR DIRTY STABBING

39:17.220 --> 39:18.983
CAUSED YOU TO TEAR
ONE OF THE FINGERS

39:19.020 --> 39:21.284
OF YOUR GREEN-SUITED GLOVE.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.413
THAT...

39:23.460 --> 39:26.827
IS YOUR PINKIE STICKING OUT
FROM BEHIND THAT LARGE BUILDING.

39:26.860 --> 39:28.179
- OBJECTION!

39:28.230 --> 39:29.424
HOW WOULD THE DEFENSE
POSSIBLY PROVE

39:29.460 --> 39:31.519
THAT IT'S MR. CAMP'S PINKIE?

39:31.570 --> 39:33.959
- I FOUND MYSELF
WONDERING THAT VERY SAME THING

39:34.000 --> 39:38.130
AS I STARED OUT INTO
THE TWINKLING SANTA BARBARA SKY.

39:38.170 --> 39:42.334
BUT THEN I REALIZED ONE
OF THOSE TWINKLES ISN'T A STAR.

39:42.380 --> 39:44.473
I KNOW WHAT TORE THAT SUIT.

39:44.510 --> 39:48.002
IT'S AN OPAL STONE
FROM A PINKIE RING.

39:48.050 --> 39:50.644
BUT NOT JUST
ANY PINKIE RING...

39:50.680 --> 39:51.942
- AH!
- SORRY.

39:51.990 --> 39:54.185
THAT'S WHAT I GET
FOR NOT LOOKING.

39:54.220 --> 39:55.414
- WHAT ARE YOU--

39:55.460 --> 39:57.985
- THAT...
PINKIE RING.

39:58.020 --> 40:02.593
[crowd murmuring]

40:02.630 --> 40:07.363
GAME, SET, MATCH.

40:07.400 --> 40:11.131
ANY FINAL WORDS,
MR. CAMP?

40:12.340 --> 40:14.069
- [scoffs]

40:15.510 --> 40:17.068
I LOVE YOU, CONNIE.

40:17.110 --> 40:18.998
I JUST WANTED US
TO BE HAPPY TOGETHER.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.439
I WOULD'VE DONE
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

40:21.480 --> 40:23.209
- INCLUDING MURDER.

40:23.250 --> 40:25.241
- YES, INCLUDING STABBING
AND MURDERING, I MEAN--

40:25.290 --> 40:27.019
- DOUBLE,
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.

40:27.050 --> 40:29.018
'CAUSE YOU KILLED
THAT POOR SCHLEP RUBEN LEONARD

40:29.060 --> 40:31.016
RIGHT BEFORE HE DID
THE WEATHER, ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

40:31.060 --> 40:32.152
- TWO-FOR-ONE DAY.

40:32.190 --> 40:34.158
- TWO-FOR-ONE DAY, JUDGE.

40:34.190 --> 40:35.418
- GOD.

40:35.460 --> 40:37.496
[applause]

40:37.530 --> 40:39.589
- AH, COME HERE.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.858
- WE DID IT.
YEAH.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.134
COME ON.

40:47.840 --> 40:48.636
- YEAH.

40:48.680 --> 40:53.049
[indistinct chatter]

40:58.520 --> 41:00.078
- [laughing]

41:03.690 --> 41:05.521
- H-STOCK!
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, GUYS?

41:05.560 --> 41:07.152
I JUST WANTED TO STOP BY,

41:07.190 --> 41:09.226
SAY THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR HELPING ME.

41:09.260 --> 41:10.921
AND I GOT GUS
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

41:10.960 --> 41:13.360
- OH, DUDE! MY TIE.
- CLASSY.

41:13.400 --> 41:14.890
- YEAH, GAVE ME THE CONFIDENCE
TO WIN THE CASE,

41:14.940 --> 41:16.760
BUT, UH, I DON'T NEED IT
ANYMORE.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.290
- I THINK THERE'S A STAIN
ON THIS TIE.

41:18.340 --> 41:20.968
- EH, NO STAIN.
I DON'T MEAN TO BE COCKY,

41:21.010 --> 41:22.432
BUT, UH, I FEEL LIKE
I CAN DO ANYTHING NOW.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.232
- I THINK IT'S KETCHUP.
WHO DOES THAT?

41:24.280 --> 41:26.271
WHO BORROWS A TIE
AND RETURNS IT WITH A STAIN?

41:26.310 --> 41:27.402
- HEY, SHAWN, CAN I BROACH
SOMETHING PERSONAL WITH YOU?

41:27.450 --> 41:29.475
- BROACH AWAY.

41:29.520 --> 41:31.249
- YOU KNOW THAT JUNIOR DETECTIVE
THAT YOU'RE SO SMITTEN WITH?

41:31.280 --> 41:33.043
- JULES. SURE.
- JULES.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.409
IF THINGS AREN'T GONNA GO
ANYWHERE IN THE FUTURE,
