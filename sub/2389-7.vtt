00:00.787 --> 00:03.875
<i>Kids, as you know,</i>
<i>Lily and Marshall had decided</i>

00:03.876 --> 00:06.360
<i>to move to Rome after</i>
<i>Barney and Robin's wedding.</i>

00:06.362 --> 00:07.545
We're going to Italy.

00:07.547 --> 00:09.029
<i>Si.</i>

00:09.031 --> 00:10.381
<i>But without telling Lily,</i>

00:10.383 --> 00:12.866
<i>Marshall had then accepted</i>
<i>a judgeship in New York.</i>

00:12.868 --> 00:15.319
Good luck with that...
Your Honor.

00:15.321 --> 00:17.721
<i>Until his always-helpful</i>
<i>road trip companion</i>

00:17.723 --> 00:20.591
<i>Daphne had selflessly</i>
<i>come to his aid.</i>

00:20.593 --> 00:22.676
You texted Lily
that I took the job?

00:22.678 --> 00:23.877
You're welcome.

00:23.879 --> 00:24.929
You were torturing yourself

00:24.931 --> 00:26.230
figuring out how to tell her,

00:26.232 --> 00:27.648
I just broke the ice for you.

00:27.650 --> 00:29.316
I was standing on that ice.

00:29.318 --> 00:31.068
Now I'm gonna be bobbing,

00:31.070 --> 00:33.404
facedown on a frigid creek.

00:33.406 --> 00:36.157
I do not need to know the nasty
way you apologize to your wife.

00:36.159 --> 00:39.944
And frigid? Maybe you're
just doing it wrong.

00:42.247 --> 00:43.664
Hi, baby.

00:43.666 --> 00:45.583
I can't believe you did this
behind my back.

00:45.585 --> 00:47.501
I know, I should
have talked to you.

00:47.503 --> 00:48.953
Thanks to you, we are stuck

00:48.955 --> 00:52.173
all weekend in the room
with a ghost in it.

00:52.175 --> 00:54.258
Room with a...?

00:54.260 --> 00:56.510
We got 13?

00:56.512 --> 00:59.079
The room that's haunted by
the ghost of Captain Dearduff?

00:59.081 --> 01:01.201
Who got the who
with the what now?

<i>Marshall had</i>
<i>recently discovered</i>

01:15.998 --> 01:17.931
<i>that the Farhampton Inn</i>
<i>was featured</i>

01:17.933 --> 01:20.701
<i>in an episode of The Ghost</i>
<i>Network's original series,</i>

01:20.703 --> 01:23.487
True & Real Ghost Stories
of the Supernatural.

01:23.489 --> 01:25.039
Ooh, there, see?

01:25.041 --> 01:26.407
The Farhampton Inn.

01:26.409 --> 01:27.774
I told you it sounded familiar.

01:27.776 --> 01:29.610
<i>In 1843,</i>

01:29.612 --> 01:32.546
<i>the streets of Farhampton,</i>
<i>Long Island</i>

01:32.548 --> 01:34.281
<i>were stalked</i>
<i>by a vicious killer</i>

01:34.283 --> 01:37.084
<i>named Captain Blazeby Dearduff.</i>

01:37.086 --> 01:40.638
<i>Dubbed "Dearduff the Hooker,"</i>
<i>he murdered dozens</i>

01:40.640 --> 01:43.807
<i>of unwary travelers</i>
<i>with his sharpened hook.</i>

01:43.809 --> 01:46.143
<i>Ironically that hook</i>

01:46.145 --> 01:48.062
<i>would prove Dearduff's</i>
<i>own undoing</i>

01:48.064 --> 01:50.964
<i>one wintry night in room 13</i>

01:50.966 --> 01:53.434
<i>of the Farhampton Inn.</i>

01:59.275 --> 02:01.408
Uh-oh.

02:01.410 --> 02:04.111
<i>He was found the next morning,</i>
<i>frozen to death.</i>

02:04.113 --> 02:06.497
Boom!

02:06.499 --> 02:10.366
<i>Some say you can still hear</i>
<i>Captain Dearduff's cries coming</i>

02:10.369 --> 02:11.818
<i>from room 13.</i>

02:11.820 --> 02:13.003
Cold.

02:13.005 --> 02:15.756
So cold.

02:15.758 --> 02:19.460
Help me... help me...

02:20.462 --> 02:23.247
We can see you, Ron.

02:23.249 --> 02:25.999
<i>Some say you can still hear</i>
<i>the thump of his peg</i>

02:26.001 --> 02:28.835
<i>and the scrape of his hook.</i>

02:28.837 --> 02:30.638
<i>Others say</i>
<i>Dearduff the Hooker was just</i>

02:30.640 --> 02:33.507
<i>a popular male prostitute</i>
<i>who murdered no one</i>

02:33.509 --> 02:37.011
<i>and died of syphilis in 1848.</i>

02:37.013 --> 02:38.479
<i>Let's hear</i>
<i>from some people who have</i>

02:38.481 --> 02:40.948
<i>actually survived</i>
<i>a night in room 13.</i>

02:42.118 --> 02:43.684
Did I see a ghost?

02:43.686 --> 02:45.402
- Of course...
<i>- Yes.</i>

02:45.404 --> 02:46.520
There's...
<i>Are.</i>

02:46.522 --> 02:48.289
...such thing as ghosts.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.745
So, have you seen the ghost?

02:54.747 --> 02:56.997
Not yet, but that might just be

02:56.999 --> 02:59.917
because ghosts
don't exist, Marshall!

02:59.919 --> 03:01.752
So explain the night shirt

03:01.754 --> 03:04.672
we saw flying around our cabin
in the Poconos.

03:04.674 --> 03:06.974
An owl got stuck in it.

03:06.976 --> 03:09.710
We saw it fly out the neck hole.

03:09.712 --> 03:12.212
Yeah, the ghost of an owl
that died in that cabin.

03:12.214 --> 03:15.882
Plus it's a crappy room,
but when I tried to complain...

03:15.884 --> 03:18.652
The thermostat in
my room is broken.

03:18.654 --> 03:20.254
The AC won't turn off.

03:20.256 --> 03:22.523
Ooh!

03:22.525 --> 03:24.608
Sounds like the work
of Captain Dearduff.

03:24.610 --> 03:27.411
He brings with him
the icy chill of death.

03:27.413 --> 03:31.165
So... bad luck there.

03:31.733 --> 03:33.233
Night-night.

03:33.235 --> 03:35.919
It sounds like you're
using Captain Dearduff

03:35.921 --> 03:38.672
as an excuse for a crappy room.

03:38.674 --> 03:39.757
I beg your pardon.

03:39.759 --> 03:41.959
I did not get to be
a 40-year-old night clerk

03:41.961 --> 03:43.711
by making excuses.

03:43.713 --> 03:45.346
Now, if there is anything
wrong with your room

03:45.348 --> 03:46.463
that isn't ghost-related,

03:46.465 --> 03:48.048
I'm more than happy
to address it.

03:48.050 --> 03:51.301
Okay, the Wi-Fi doesn't work.

03:51.303 --> 03:52.886
Ghosts interfere
with electronic devices.

03:52.888 --> 03:54.054
The shower's leaking.

03:54.056 --> 03:55.639
Dearduff likes
the sound of dripping.

03:55.641 --> 03:58.475
Reminds him
of his bleeding victims.

03:58.477 --> 03:59.977
And the door won't lock.

03:59.979 --> 04:01.612
Captain Dearduff
doesn't want to...

04:01.614 --> 04:03.280
you know,
be locked out of his room.

04:03.282 --> 04:05.149
Why would a locked door
keep a ghost out?

04:05.151 --> 04:07.601
Can't he just walk
through walls?

04:07.603 --> 04:08.952
Maybe he's afraid of rats.

04:08.954 --> 04:11.071
There are rats in the walls?

04:13.074 --> 04:15.492
No.

04:15.494 --> 04:17.661
And the inn's booked up
because of the wedding,

04:17.663 --> 04:19.380
so we can't change rooms.

04:19.382 --> 04:22.616
Oh, that sucks.

04:22.618 --> 04:24.251
I'm sorry, baby.

04:24.253 --> 04:25.419
Hey...

04:25.421 --> 04:26.637
but if Dearduff does manifest,

04:26.639 --> 04:28.055
you know the proper way
to harvest ectoplasm, right?

04:30.259 --> 04:32.142
Hey, good news-- we're all set
for the dove release.

04:32.144 --> 04:33.960
The what?
When we leave the church,

04:33.962 --> 04:35.629
they're gonna release
a hundred doves.

04:35.631 --> 04:38.065
It's gonna be
avi-wait-for-it-ary.

04:38.067 --> 04:39.349
Aviary!

04:39.351 --> 04:40.467
Oh.

04:40.469 --> 04:42.486
That might be a problem.
Why?

04:42.488 --> 04:43.937
Because when
we leave the church,

04:43.939 --> 04:46.139
a few of the gun enthusiasts
in my family

04:46.141 --> 04:48.442
are gonna fire a 21-gun salute.

04:48.444 --> 04:50.778
Hey, man.

04:56.701 --> 04:59.086
Oh, look-- one got away.

05:00.823 --> 05:02.656
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

05:02.658 --> 05:04.875
At a wedding?

05:04.877 --> 05:07.127
Yeah, that's romantic.

05:30.518 --> 05:32.018
Ted!

05:32.020 --> 05:34.321
What the hell are
you doing in my room?!

05:34.323 --> 05:35.372
Uh...

05:35.374 --> 05:36.957
<i>There was an explanation.</i>

05:36.959 --> 05:39.877
<i>You see, after Marshall</i>
<i>got off the phone with Lily,</i>

05:39.879 --> 05:41.411
<i>he'd called me.</i>

05:43.082 --> 05:44.498
Hey, buddy. What's up?

05:44.500 --> 05:46.750
Ted, listen, I need you
to sneak into Lily's room,

05:46.752 --> 05:49.169
find her phone, and delete
the last text she got.

05:49.171 --> 05:49.887
Why? What's...

05:49.889 --> 05:51.638
Ted, I need you to do this

05:51.640 --> 05:52.890
no questions asked.

05:52.892 --> 05:56.727
And as we both know, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

05:57.612 --> 05:59.179
Hey.

05:59.181 --> 06:01.515
Hey. Listen, I need you
to do something for me

06:01.517 --> 06:03.684
no questions asked, okay?
What is it?

06:03.686 --> 06:06.052
Meet me at the corner
of 53rd and 8th.

06:06.054 --> 06:08.856
Bring your drill.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.444
Marshall.

06:15.446 --> 06:17.614
What the hell?

06:17.616 --> 06:19.166
How did you...

06:19.168 --> 06:20.601
No...

06:20.603 --> 06:23.137
questions... asked.

06:23.139 --> 06:25.672
I broke federal law drilling you
out of that mailbox.

06:25.674 --> 06:27.508
Hey, I was a man in need.

06:27.510 --> 06:30.344
I know.
You were a "Priority Male."

06:30.346 --> 06:31.345
You said you'd

06:31.347 --> 06:33.380
stop doing that joke
after the editor

06:33.382 --> 06:35.516
of Bazooka Joe comics
rejected it.

06:35.518 --> 06:37.134
That man is a comedy snob.

06:37.136 --> 06:38.468
The point is,

06:38.470 --> 06:39.970
you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

06:39.972 --> 06:41.889
Okay, okay!
I'll delete the text.

06:41.891 --> 06:43.106
Thank you.

06:43.108 --> 06:44.608
I just have to figure out

06:44.610 --> 06:46.143
how to get into Lily's room.

06:46.145 --> 06:48.645
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted, so...

06:48.647 --> 06:50.096
The drainpipe!
What?

06:50.098 --> 06:51.982
There's a drainpipe that
runs up near her window,

06:51.984 --> 06:54.034
and, no big deal,
I can totally climb it.

06:54.036 --> 06:55.202
I'll call you when it's done.

06:55.204 --> 06:56.320
Her door is unlock...

06:58.073 --> 06:59.406
Uh...

06:59.408 --> 07:01.625
Marshall wanted me
to check on you.

07:01.627 --> 07:03.627
He was worried
that you might be scared

07:03.629 --> 07:05.379
all alone in the ghost room.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.130
Remind me to call
you next time

07:07.132 --> 07:09.416
Marvin has a nightmare--
you can calm him

07:09.418 --> 07:13.303
by bursting into his room with
a chain saw and a hockey mask!

07:13.305 --> 07:15.589
Sorry, I didn't want to knock
in case you were already asleep,

07:15.591 --> 07:17.791
so I just climbed the drainpipe
up to your window.

07:17.793 --> 07:19.560
No big deal.
Mm, opened the latch

07:19.562 --> 07:21.595
with this here coat hanger.

07:21.597 --> 07:23.847
I would have called,
but, uh...

07:23.849 --> 07:26.850
well, I didn't know if
you'd have your phone handy.

07:26.852 --> 07:28.986
Say, where is
that old phone of yours?

07:28.988 --> 07:30.604
Ted, I am
not scared,

07:30.606 --> 07:32.806
so why don't you head back
to your room...

07:32.808 --> 07:33.941
Oh...

07:33.943 --> 07:35.692
kay...

07:35.694 --> 07:38.862
Why, I guess you can stay
until I fall asleep,

07:38.864 --> 07:40.914
if it'll make <i>you</i> feel better?

07:40.916 --> 07:43.250
A-And...

07:43.252 --> 07:45.285
maybe if it'll
make you feel even better,

07:45.287 --> 07:48.589
you can sing me a version
of Marvin's lullaby?

07:48.591 --> 07:50.040
Okay.

07:50.042 --> 07:52.042
Okay.

Oh, God, the Hooker's here!
Ted,

08:36.422 --> 08:39.039
I am not gonna cheat on Robin.

08:39.041 --> 08:42.125
But you're a hell of a best man
for getting me one, buddy.

08:42.126 --> 08:43.543
Where is she?

08:43.544 --> 08:44.895
All right,
I'll take a lap dance.

08:44.897 --> 08:47.097
Can I borrow some sweatpants?

08:51.697 --> 08:53.149
Barney, what
are you doing in there?

08:53.150 --> 08:54.250
Marshall asked me

08:54.252 --> 08:56.702
to do something for him,
no questions asked.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.654
Sidebar-- I forgot
to get my cousin David

08:58.656 --> 09:00.356
something for his bar mitzvah
last week.

09:00.358 --> 09:02.374
Could you send the hooker
to his room?

09:02.376 --> 09:04.510
Wait, Marshall called you, too?

09:04.512 --> 09:07.263
<i>Turns out I wasn't</i>
<i>Marshall's first call.</i>

09:07.265 --> 09:08.897
Can't you guys just fire blanks?

09:08.899 --> 09:11.033
At a wedding?

09:11.035 --> 09:12.685
Yeah, that's romantic.

09:12.687 --> 09:13.819
I just wish I would've

09:13.821 --> 09:15.154
known about the guns.
Well,

09:15.156 --> 09:16.555
I wish I'd known
about the doves.

09:16.557 --> 09:18.190
That's the problem with
us-- we don't think

09:18.192 --> 09:21.026
about checking in with the other
person before doing something.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.278
Honestly, I think

09:22.280 --> 09:24.229
that's what broke us up
the first time.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.198
We're both... lone wolves--

09:26.200 --> 09:28.534
always off in our own worlds.

09:28.536 --> 09:31.203
That's not gonna work.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.188
Not in a marriage, no.

09:33.190 --> 09:35.324
What? Sorry, I was thinking
about getting the doves

09:35.326 --> 09:37.293
little Kevlar tuxedos,
but that's not gonna work--

09:37.295 --> 09:39.211
there's no time for a fitting.

09:39.213 --> 09:40.629
Hey.

09:40.631 --> 09:42.498
Listen, I need you
to get to Lily's phone

09:42.500 --> 09:44.667
without her seeing, and delete
the last text she got.

09:44.669 --> 09:45.751
Why? What did you...

09:45.753 --> 09:47.035
And I need you to do it

09:47.037 --> 09:48.420
no questions asked.

09:48.422 --> 09:52.558
As you'll recall, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

09:53.677 --> 09:56.228
Hello?

09:56.230 --> 09:58.714
Marshall, I need you to rush
to the Macy's in Herald Square,

09:58.716 --> 10:00.549
find the utility closet
on the third floor,

10:00.551 --> 10:01.984
and bring me
the following things:

10:01.986 --> 10:04.436
a clean pair of underwear,
a clean pair of pants,

10:04.438 --> 10:06.939
a box of moist towelettes,
hand sanitizer,

10:06.941 --> 10:10.526
and a garbage bag,
no questions asked.

10:10.528 --> 10:11.860
You deuced your pants.

10:13.930 --> 10:16.365
Never mind.

10:16.367 --> 10:19.752
Ha. You didn't wind up
helping me, so it doesn't count.

10:19.754 --> 10:21.069
Yes, I'm the one
Face!

10:21.071 --> 10:22.788
who should be embarrassed
by that story.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.540
But that wasn't
the time I meant.

10:24.542 --> 10:26.074
This was last fall.

10:26.076 --> 10:28.293
Hey, I got here as
fast as I could.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.678
Are you okay?
Yeah, fine.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.513
Th-These quacks said I was...

10:31.515 --> 10:34.383
unfit to leave on my own.
Blah, blah, blah.

10:34.385 --> 10:36.418
"Danger to myself."
Blah, blah, blah.

10:36.420 --> 10:38.754
"Whoever signs me out is legally
responsible for my actions."

10:38.756 --> 10:40.255
I just need you to sign me out.

10:40.257 --> 10:41.273
What the hell happened?

10:41.275 --> 10:42.558
Uh-uh!

10:42.560 --> 10:44.476
I said no questions asked.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.278
W...

10:46.280 --> 10:50.032
Star, clover, horseshoe.

10:50.034 --> 10:52.067
Barney, did you swallow
real versions

10:52.069 --> 10:53.786
of all the Lucky Charms items?

10:54.621 --> 10:57.706
No... questions... asked.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.291
Now come on. Let's hit
the bar. I'm buying.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.710
I just won 50 bucks from
a little Irish guy on a dare.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.880
Fine, I'll delete the text.

11:04.882 --> 11:06.498
But how am I supposed to get
into Lily's room?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.801
Easy. The lock on her door
is busted...

11:08.803 --> 11:10.552
Air ducts!
What?

11:10.554 --> 11:12.721
I'll use the system of air ducts
to get in her room,

11:12.723 --> 11:14.956
just like the bad guy
in <i>Die Hard.</i>

11:14.958 --> 11:17.309
Barney, Bruce Willis is not
the bad guy in <i>Die H...</i>

11:17.311 --> 11:20.396
Not important. The point is,
the door is not lock...

11:20.398 --> 11:22.130
I'll call you when it's done.

11:22.132 --> 11:23.932
Anyway, I was saying,

11:23.934 --> 11:26.018
I think we need to be better
about talking to each other

11:26.020 --> 11:27.236
before doing stuff.

11:27.238 --> 11:28.404
Can't talk. Doing stuff.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.992
What is going on?

11:36.447 --> 11:38.330
Barney, what are you doing
in there?

11:38.332 --> 11:42.534
Uh, well, there is
a story there.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.821
It involves a trained
Guatemalan kinkajou,

11:45.823 --> 11:47.840
a Bolshoi Ballet
prima ballerina

11:47.842 --> 11:50.459
and Olympic gold medalist
Duke Kahanamoku's surfboard.

11:50.461 --> 11:52.628
Tell her, Ted.

11:53.379 --> 11:55.130
Uh...

11:55.132 --> 11:57.015
uh...

11:57.017 --> 11:58.517
uh...
The kinkajou...

11:58.519 --> 12:01.136
the kinkajou...

12:01.138 --> 12:04.640
Oh, God, what is it now?

12:04.642 --> 12:06.508
Good evening,
Ms. Aldrin.

12:06.510 --> 12:08.811
I didn't order room service.

12:08.813 --> 12:10.679
It says right here, room 13.

12:10.681 --> 12:12.815
Lobster, caviar, champagne.

12:12.817 --> 12:14.650
$400?!

12:14.652 --> 12:16.702
I didn't order any of this.

12:16.704 --> 12:19.020
Maybe Dearduff the Hooker
ordered it.

12:19.022 --> 12:22.040
Well, I'm not paying for room
service the Hooker ordered!

12:22.042 --> 12:24.960
- I've been there.
- Okay,

12:24.962 --> 12:28.163
you know what? I need to
talk to the manager.

12:29.132 --> 12:32.301
All right,
where's that damn phone?

12:32.303 --> 12:34.470
You, too?!

12:38.675 --> 12:39.842
- Hey.
- Robin,

12:39.844 --> 12:41.510
I need you to delete
the last text

12:41.512 --> 12:43.011
that Lily got
before she sees it.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.097
Bro, it's my wedding weekend.

12:45.099 --> 12:46.431
Just because
you didn't know better

12:46.433 --> 12:47.883
than to take a naked selfie

12:47.885 --> 12:49.735
while you were in the coldest
part of the country...

12:49.737 --> 12:51.270
First, I'm an Eriksen.

12:51.272 --> 12:53.555
Cold has a plumping effect.

12:53.557 --> 12:56.775
Second, you owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

12:56.777 --> 13:00.028
All right, I'm-I'm at the alley
near 22nd and 2nd. Now what?

13:00.030 --> 13:01.947
No questions asked. Tell me
about that giant trout

13:01.949 --> 13:04.500
you and your dad caught
ice-fishing that one time.

13:04.502 --> 13:07.119
Well, it was more beast
than trout.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.705
Fought us for three hours
and nearly dragged us both

13:09.707 --> 13:11.406
into Lake Winnibigoshish.

13:11.408 --> 13:13.091
It was this big, and...

13:13.093 --> 13:14.793
Hey.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.712
Run!

13:22.602 --> 13:24.636
I never asked you
who those weirdos were,

13:24.638 --> 13:26.421
why they kept calling you
Night Falcon

13:26.423 --> 13:28.941
or even what was in those darts
that they were blowing at us.

13:28.943 --> 13:30.592
Your vision came back,
didn't it?

13:30.594 --> 13:32.594
Wuss.

13:32.596 --> 13:34.196
Fine, I'll take care of it.

13:34.198 --> 13:36.698
Just have to figure out
how to get into Lily's room.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.200
Her door doesn't lock.
You can just...

13:38.202 --> 13:39.902
Room service!

13:39.904 --> 13:41.119
Night Falcon, you're a genius.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.322
I'll call you when it's done.

13:44.774 --> 13:46.158
Why would he call

13:46.160 --> 13:48.243
you guys before me?
Well, dude,

13:48.245 --> 13:49.545
you're not great in a crisis.

13:49.547 --> 13:51.663
What was that story
you were prattling on about?

13:51.665 --> 13:53.048
What the hell
is a kinkajou?

13:53.050 --> 13:54.466
Okay, let's just find it
before she gets back.

13:54.468 --> 13:55.584
<i>I'm sorry, ma'am.</i>

13:55.586 --> 13:57.586
You ordered it,
so you have to pay for it.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.955
Not to mention the room damage
you're responsible for.

13:59.957 --> 14:01.406
I've got
a report here:

14:01.408 --> 14:03.308
broken lock, faulty Wi-Fi,

14:03.310 --> 14:05.727
you've taken several items
from the minibar...

14:05.729 --> 14:07.379
There is no minibar.

14:07.381 --> 14:08.814
Stolen minibar.

14:09.766 --> 14:10.649
It's not here.

14:10.651 --> 14:12.517
Well, where else would it be?

14:12.519 --> 14:13.652
Okay.

14:13.654 --> 14:16.822
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

14:16.824 --> 14:18.273
Uh-oh.

14:20.850 --> 14:23.662
Okay, we need to get to Lily's
phone before she sees that text.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.112
I'm on it.
Night Falcon is on it.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.914
Good thing I packed my unitard.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.764
This is exactly
what we always do, isn't it?

14:34.789 --> 14:35.357
Yeah.

14:35.358 --> 14:37.624
We were both gonna bolt off
and lone wolf it

14:37.626 --> 14:40.127
without telling
the other person a thing.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.180
Why do we do that?
I don't know.

14:43.182 --> 14:46.567
Maybe we're just incapable
of working as a unit.

14:49.437 --> 14:51.906
You know...

14:51.908 --> 14:55.442
I bet even lone wolves
can learn to work together.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.028
I'd like to think so.

14:58.030 --> 15:02.149
They could build their little
woodland den together.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.335
Roam together.

15:04.337 --> 15:05.753
Hunt together.

15:05.755 --> 15:08.155
Lure prey into
a tight corner and...

15:08.157 --> 15:10.507
Snap its limbs
with our powerful jaws

15:10.509 --> 15:13.043
and watch the life drain
from its eyes.

15:13.045 --> 15:15.129
Aw...

15:15.131 --> 15:18.498
Point is, we're gonna
make a great team.

15:18.500 --> 15:20.684
We'll just need
some practice.

15:20.686 --> 15:24.305
Yeah. Yeah, let's prove
that we believe in marriage

15:24.307 --> 15:25.672
by working together

15:25.674 --> 15:28.442
to help Marshall
hide something from his wife.

15:31.913 --> 15:35.282
<i>First, we take position</i>
<i>in the lobby.</i>

15:37.819 --> 15:40.237
<i>Then you cause a distraction.</i>

15:42.024 --> 15:45.826
<i>Then you send in a trained dove</i>
<i>to grab Lily's phone.</i>

15:45.828 --> 15:47.828
<i>The dove drops the phone</i>
<i>into your hand.</i>

15:47.830 --> 15:49.363
<i>You delete the text</i>

15:49.365 --> 15:51.498
<i>and toss it back</i>
<i>on the counter.</i>

15:55.020 --> 15:56.703
Wait.

15:56.705 --> 15:58.672
It's absolutely insane...

15:59.707 --> 16:01.842
...how foolproof this plan is!

16:01.844 --> 16:03.894
Sometimes it's best
to just go simple.

16:03.896 --> 16:05.813
Yep.

16:08.351 --> 16:09.817
Wh-Why do you have a gun?

16:09.819 --> 16:11.435
Why do you always have a gun?

16:11.437 --> 16:12.519
Where's Lily?

16:12.521 --> 16:13.904
She went up 20 minutes ago.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.356
You're kidding.

16:15.358 --> 16:17.491
Courtney Dove, no!

16:17.493 --> 16:19.109
I already lost Kurt Coo-bain!

16:19.111 --> 16:21.228
I can't lose you as well.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.414
Great. How are we gonna
get Lily's phone back now?

16:23.416 --> 16:24.948
Oh, I already took care of that.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.400
And now I'm rewarding myself

16:26.402 --> 16:28.369
with some of the inn's
finest brandy.

16:28.371 --> 16:29.286
Bottoms up.

16:29.288 --> 16:30.287
Well, thank you.

16:30.289 --> 16:31.338
No, no, that's a warning.

16:31.340 --> 16:32.373
The dove's about to...

16:34.543 --> 16:35.709
What happened?

16:35.711 --> 16:37.378
Well...

16:37.380 --> 16:40.631
I think it's time
I call my lawyer.

16:46.054 --> 16:47.921
Hi, baby.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.441
You are never gonna
believe this, but...

16:50.443 --> 16:53.143
Uh, someone sent me a text.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.946
Lily, stop!

16:56.481 --> 16:57.448
Why?

16:57.450 --> 16:59.116
Because...

16:59.118 --> 17:01.435
because...

17:01.437 --> 17:02.820
<i>And that's when I realized</i>

17:02.822 --> 17:05.605
<i>that the answer</i>
<i>had been there all along.</i>

17:05.607 --> 17:07.991
Throw your phone on the ground
and smash it with your foot.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.159
What? No.
I need you

17:09.161 --> 17:11.127
to do this no questions asked.

17:11.130 --> 17:14.248
You owe me
a "No Questions Asked."

17:15.133 --> 17:16.633
Hey, Lil. What's...
Ted, I need you

17:16.635 --> 17:18.385
to come
to my classroom right now

17:18.387 --> 17:20.002
with two dozen cupcakes
and a box cutter.

17:20.005 --> 17:21.771
No questions asked.

17:21.773 --> 17:23.790
Lily, I brought the...

17:23.791 --> 17:25.342
Oh-oh, my God.

17:25.344 --> 17:26.593
Ted,

17:26.595 --> 17:28.795
put the cupcakes at the feet
of their leader,

17:28.797 --> 17:30.130
then cut me loose.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.815
Don't make eye contact!

17:34.103 --> 17:35.319
Ted...

17:35.321 --> 17:39.773
No... questions... asked.

17:45.448 --> 17:48.782
Well, interesting that I was
the one who fixed everything

17:48.784 --> 17:51.251
even though Marshall
called me...

17:51.253 --> 17:53.120
- third.
<i>- Ninth,</i>

17:53.122 --> 17:55.706
<i>as I found out later,</i>
<i>but I won't go into it.</i>

17:55.708 --> 17:57.291
<i>The important thing</i>
<i>is what happened</i>

17:57.293 --> 18:00.377
<i>right after the untimely death</i>
<i>of Lily's phone.</i>

18:00.379 --> 18:02.463
So you're saying
you didn't order room service

18:02.465 --> 18:05.132
and you didn't order
<i>Prison Sluts Nine?</i>

18:05.134 --> 18:09.520
I am saying I did not order
room service.

18:10.138 --> 18:11.939
It is done. By me.

18:11.941 --> 18:14.691
Your third call.

18:14.693 --> 18:16.343
Actually, you were...

18:16.345 --> 18:18.562
Thank you. H-How did you do it?

18:18.564 --> 18:20.564
I called in a "No Questions
Asked" with Lily.

18:20.566 --> 18:21.848
But, wait,
why didn't you do that?

18:21.850 --> 18:23.283
You must have, like,
a million of those.

18:23.285 --> 18:25.202
<i>And Marshall thought back.</i>

18:25.204 --> 18:26.520
Hello?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.571
Hey, baby, it's me.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.456
Um, can you come bail me
out of jail?

18:29.458 --> 18:31.858
I thought I saw Bigfoot
in Central Park

18:31.860 --> 18:33.193
and so I tackled him,

18:33.195 --> 18:36.547
but it turned out
to be Russell Brand.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.549
Hey...

18:38.551 --> 18:41.919
Oh, do you mind looking up
our vaccination records?

18:41.921 --> 18:45.556
I tried to hug a raccoon.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.724
Hey, babe, um,

18:47.726 --> 18:49.042
could you dig up our warranty?

18:49.044 --> 18:51.711
I took the TV apart, and I made

18:51.713 --> 18:53.981
a robot out of it.

18:53.983 --> 18:55.182
Hello?

18:55.184 --> 18:56.433
Hey.

18:56.435 --> 18:58.735
I tackled
Russell Brand again.

18:58.737 --> 19:01.655
I've never asked Lily to do
anything no questions asked

19:01.657 --> 19:03.490
because...

19:03.492 --> 19:05.993
I've never wanted to.

19:05.995 --> 19:07.727
She's the love of my life.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.532
I never keep anything from her.

19:11.534 --> 19:14.585
Ted, put Lily on the phone.

19:15.403 --> 19:18.071
Hey. It's Marshall.

19:19.707 --> 19:22.593
Want to tell me what's going on?

19:22.595 --> 19:24.411
Yes.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.264
I was offered a judgeship
in New York.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.966
And I took it.

19:28.968 --> 19:32.886
Even though we already agreed
to move to Rome.

19:32.888 --> 19:35.055
I'm gonna be a judge.

19:37.141 --> 19:39.109
Lily?

19:40.195 --> 19:43.447
You know, Marshall,
I don't believe in ghosts,

19:43.449 --> 19:47.150
and I'm not sure anyone died
in our room,

19:47.152 --> 19:49.536
but someone's going to.

20:00.281 --> 20:02.860
"And I see in your eyes
the emerald reefs

20:02.861 --> 20:05.228
"of the primordial seas afroth

20:05.230 --> 20:06.947
"with the first stirrings
of life,

20:06.949 --> 20:09.650
"infinite in mystery
and miracle.

20:09.652 --> 20:11.034
"Forever yours,

20:11.036 --> 20:13.520
"the guy you met
at the drugstore an hour ago.

20:13.522 --> 20:15.539
"I heard you give your address
to the pharmacist

20:15.541 --> 20:18.191
while I was buying foot powder."

20:18.193 --> 20:20.377
Yeah.

20:25.199 --> 20:27.050
Mailed it.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.423
No! No! No, no!
