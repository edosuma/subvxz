WEBVTT

00:00.443 --> 00:02.775
I need you to find a way to
move to the Cabinet Office.

00:02.975 --> 00:03.908
Why?

00:05.133 --> 00:06.497
It's the heart of government.

00:06.522 --> 00:09.000
Don't you want to be at
the centre of it all?

00:09.133 --> 00:10.627
Priscilla Garrick.

00:10.652 --> 00:12.707
I think she was having
an affair with Jarvis.

00:12.732 --> 00:15.148
When I asked her she denied it,
but she did a little thing

00:15.173 --> 00:17.348
that made me think she was lying.

00:17.373 --> 00:19.478
She cleared her throat.

00:19.503 --> 00:20.755
She does that when she's nervous.

00:20.755 --> 00:22.008
But why would she be nervous?

00:22.033 --> 00:23.497
Can I tell you a secret?

00:23.522 --> 00:26.258
Russians have placed a
fellow in our department.

00:26.283 --> 00:28.108
He doesn't want to say anything anyway,

00:28.133 --> 00:29.548
and he's not on to me.

00:29.573 --> 00:31.918
I'll take it from here.

00:31.943 --> 00:32.586
Please.

00:32.886 --> 00:35.228
It's nothing for you to worry about, comrade.

00:38.003 --> 00:39.675
The politician you were dancing with...

00:39.675 --> 00:41.348
- We're barely acquainted.
- Change that.

00:41.373 --> 00:43.377
The Americans want us to
let 100,000 Jews into what

00:43.402 --> 00:45.148
they allege is their homeland.

00:45.173 --> 00:48.827
The Arabs, understandably,
would prefer we did no such thing.

00:48.852 --> 00:50.338
I want to know more about her.

00:50.363 --> 00:51.988
Compromise? Coercion?

00:52.013 --> 00:55.268
Her brother's probably a homosexual.

00:56.772 --> 00:58.118
I met someone today.

00:58.143 --> 00:59.778
His name is Nicholas Sullivan.

00:59.803 --> 01:02.738
He's MI5 and I want to
tell him what's going on.

01:03.163 --> 01:05.288
We know the Russians
accessed information shared at

01:05.313 --> 01:08.088
two private Cabinet Office meetings.

01:08.113 --> 01:12.208
Someone who was at both of those
meetings is working for Stalin.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

02:35.263 --> 02:37.727
A colleague was asking me about Jarvis.

02:37.752 --> 02:39.128
Asking what? I

02:39.153 --> 02:41.977
About my relationship with him.

02:42.002 --> 02:43.998
You think he knows something?

02:45.193 --> 02:47.648
Probably just office gossip.

02:47.673 --> 02:49.408
But I'm looking into him.

03:15.942 --> 03:17.418
Hello.

03:19.952 --> 03:21.967
You were talking in your sleep.

03:21.992 --> 03:24.528
Was I? What was I saying?

03:24.553 --> 03:26.258
You were just mumbling.

03:30.033 --> 03:31.998
Are you all right?

03:32.023 --> 03:34.727
You were having a nightmare, I think.

03:34.752 --> 03:36.288
I don't remember.

03:44.543 --> 03:46.438
May I...

03:48.033 --> 03:49.857
...distract you from your troubles?

03:53.513 --> 03:56.758
I'm sorry. I have an early meeting.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.937
I can't sit in the fucking back.

04:17.962 --> 04:21.208
I need to be able to talk to
someone, connect with someone.

04:21.233 --> 04:22.727
We both work for the same guy.

04:22.752 --> 04:26.057
It would be nice to have a friend
who knows, you know, everything.

04:30.303 --> 04:32.338
Generally speaking,,
my friends are more chatty,

04:32.363 --> 04:33.697
but I'll take what I can get.

05:35.433 --> 05:36.758
Good morning. I

05:42.862 --> 05:44.957
Will you be joining me in the back,

05:44.982 --> 05:46.957
or shall we all try to
squeeze in up front?

06:04.253 --> 06:06.448
So, you wrote a long speech.

06:06.473 --> 06:08.628
It should be enough to
keep her busy for a while.

06:10.752 --> 06:14.047
Does it sound like a speech
a minister would say? Mm-hm.

06:14.072 --> 06:16.088
Well, will she notice
if he never gives it?

06:16.113 --> 06:17.618
She's just a secretary.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.778
Mm, except likely not.

06:19.803 --> 06:21.847
We know she has access.

06:21.872 --> 06:24.258
Is she passing documents
on to a larger network?

06:26.353 --> 06:28.498
I'll need to take a look in her flat.

06:28.523 --> 06:29.618
Keep her there until eight.

06:31.023 --> 06:33.258
I need you to work late tonight.

06:33.283 --> 06:34.778
Tonight?

06:34.803 --> 06:36.898
We're all working late.
There's a lot to do.

06:36.923 --> 06:41.057
Then why are you standing around
and not helping to nationalise coal?

06:41.082 --> 06:43.568
She needs me to work late
and I have an appointment.

06:43.593 --> 06:45.448
Well, use Jane. I

06:47.443 --> 06:49.778
I find Mrs Savitt
particularly efficient.

06:49.803 --> 06:51.338
And there's so much to do,

06:51.363 --> 06:53.498
we have to nationalise coal and steel.

06:53.523 --> 06:55.008
Oh, all right.

07:08.603 --> 07:11.298
Working late? Extra points for you.

07:14.513 --> 07:17.368
Miss Garrick invited me to a
dinner party at her home next week.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.578
She has these, you know, salons.

07:21.822 --> 07:23.618
Were you invited?

07:23.643 --> 07:25.177
I wasn't.

07:25.202 --> 07:27.057
Well, you're new.

07:28.793 --> 07:30.288
Goodnight.

09:16.373 --> 09:19.798
Ah! I brought you a cup of tea.
I'm sorry to keep you so late.

09:19.823 --> 09:21.548
This is taking longer
than I thought it would

09:21.573 --> 09:23.348
and I actually need to go home now.

09:23.373 --> 09:26.488
I'm sorry, but the minister
does need this for tomorrow.

09:26.513 --> 09:27.967
It's inconvenient for me too.

10:07.103 --> 10:08.688
There we are.

10:10.393 --> 10:12.818
OK. Take your coat off.

10:14.313 --> 10:16.328
And I'll get you something to eat.

10:30.283 --> 10:32.298
Jacob! Get back!

10:33.723 --> 10:35.778
Jackob, nazadt!

11:12.513 --> 11:14.418
Thank you so much.

11:14.443 --> 11:16.408
Where are you off to in such a rush?

11:18.952 --> 11:21.047
My son's coming home tonight.

11:21.072 --> 11:22.328
Tonight?

11:22.353 --> 11:24.488
He's been...

11:24.513 --> 11:26.468
You know.

11:26.493 --> 11:28.418
He was evacueed.

11:28.443 --> 11:30.288
How long was he away for?

11:30.313 --> 11:32.458
Four years.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.927
In America.

11:33.952 --> 11:36.097
So, yeah, I gotta get back home.

11:36.122 --> 11:38.057
I want to cook him supper.

11:38.082 --> 11:40.937
I'm sorry. Go. Go.

11:40.962 --> 11:42.368
Thank you.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.177
What happened to you?

12:14.502 --> 12:15.857
Burglar!

12:15.882 --> 12:18.268
But the door's not broken or anything!

12:23.132 --> 12:24.658
Jackob!

12:26.002 --> 12:29.488
My mum says it's OK if I
don't really remember you.

12:47.313 --> 12:48.218
Have you eaten?

13:08.663 --> 13:10.038
What happened to your face?

13:11.533 --> 13:13.888
The mother was supposed
to be out playing whist.

13:13.913 --> 13:16.508
The mother came home early.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.398
The mother did that to him!

13:18.423 --> 13:22.768
Russian women are famously strong.
This one now has a broken nose.

13:22.793 --> 13:26.357
I took some money.
She thinks I was a burglar.

13:26.382 --> 13:29.788
You broke her nose? She's fine.
And what about her son? Is he hurt?

13:29.813 --> 13:33.158
Everybody made it out alive.

13:33.183 --> 13:36.528
Good. Because Miss
Savitt's not a Communist.

13:36.553 --> 13:38.408
She's a Jew.

13:38.433 --> 13:41.838
I'd say that makes her more likely.
Lots of Jews are Communists.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.918
Some are Communists. Some are not.

13:43.943 --> 13:46.888
And I have to assume the ones
who carry prayer books are not.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.908
"Religion is the opium of
the people," said Marx.

13:49.933 --> 13:51.998
Uh, if I may interrupt the
expert for a minute, I'm the one

13:52.023 --> 13:55.318
who's been to Miss Savitt's
house and there I confirmed - A,

13:55.343 --> 13:59.158
she's Russian, B, she stashes away
more money than a secretary should

13:59.183 --> 14:03.477
have and C) - and this is definitive
- she has two pills hidden.

14:03.502 --> 14:05.567
Cyanide pills, suicide pills.

14:05.592 --> 14:08.427
What agents take when their cover
is blown. I must get you one.

14:10.793 --> 14:14.068
We need to figure out if the
secretary is working with Miss Garrick.

14:14.093 --> 14:17.148
I think she is.

14:17.173 --> 14:19.638
Jarvis came to me a terrified man.

14:19.663 --> 14:22.918
We were supposed to meet
again. He was killed.

14:22.943 --> 14:26.718
Why was he killed?
He must've confided in someone.

14:26.743 --> 14:31.638
But, like I said,
he was a terrified man, meaning...

14:31.663 --> 14:34.628
Meaning? Meaning? He would only
confide in someone he loved,

14:34.653 --> 14:37.628
Miss Garrick, and she had him killed!

14:37.653 --> 14:39.918
Look, I think it's very unlikely.

14:39.943 --> 14:42.687
That's because you've been at
this job five fucking minutes!

14:44.452 --> 14:46.427
Sentiment's clouding your judgement.

14:51.863 --> 14:54.557
You need proof.

14:54.582 --> 14:55.758
Exactly.

14:57.823 --> 15:01.168
The big five get here next week.

15:01.193 --> 15:06.528
Maybe you should be taking this
secretary for a ride and using some...

15:06.553 --> 15:08.908
"special methods of questioning.

15:12.943 --> 15:15.717
I would be so grateful...

15:15.742 --> 15:19.087
...if the two of you would stop
telling me how to do my job.

15:25.512 --> 15:27.386
Who are the big five?

15:27.411 --> 15:28.847
You don't need to know yet.

15:28.872 --> 15:32.157
Do they approve of torture?
The Russian army raped women, you said.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.396
You said they were barbarians
and now Jimmy's talking about

15:34.421 --> 15:35.947
"special methods of questioning"?

15:35.972 --> 15:38.287
He misspoke. Don't worry about Jimmy.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.887
I don't want to do this any more.

15:44.112 --> 15:45.957
Excuse me?

15:45.982 --> 15:47.646
Honestly...

15:47.671 --> 15:49.566
...I don't think Miss Savitt's the mole.

15:49.591 --> 15:51.597
I don't think Miss Garrick's a
killer, and I don't think I can

15:51.622 --> 15:53.957
possibly be of any use to you -

15:53.982 --> 15:56.656
any good for you and your mission
- when I don't believe in it.

16:05.182 --> 16:07.927
This is... absolutely my fault, but...

16:09.162 --> 16:11.077
...I only got into
this because of Peter,

16:11.102 --> 16:13.157
and to be honest with you it
hasn't felt right since then.

16:13.182 --> 16:15.157
No offence... to you.

16:18.182 --> 16:20.687
A needlepoint on the wall
of my grandparents' house.

16:22.312 --> 16:23.766
"Know thyself.".

16:25.742 --> 16:27.597
Exactly.

16:27.622 --> 16:30.396
And you have a whole agency behind you.

16:30.421 --> 16:31.927
You must have people with
more experience than me.

16:33.471 --> 16:34.766
I understand.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.247
Shall we shake hands or something?

16:42.822 --> 16:44.566
Thank you.

16:47.302 --> 16:48.957
Jackson.

16:50.152 --> 16:51.847
Bye.

16:51.872 --> 16:52.797
See ya.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.597
Go and get my insurance policy.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.916
You're in an awfully good mood!

17:20.942 --> 17:22.776
My good mood? It's awful!

17:58.591 --> 18:01.316
What's wrong? Did I hurt you?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.127
No, um...

18:03.152 --> 18:05.766
Just... just go slowly, OK?

18:05.791 --> 18:06.997
OK.

18:17.242 --> 18:20.316
No, stop, stop, stop.

18:20.341 --> 18:22.007
I'm sorry. It's OK. I'm sorry.

18:23.942 --> 18:24.947
It's OK.

18:24.972 --> 18:26.407
It's OK.

18:26.432 --> 18:27.566
I'm sorry.

18:30.791 --> 18:32.526
It's OK.

18:36.581 --> 18:37.947
I don't know what's wrong.

18:37.972 --> 18:39.157
It's OK.

18:46.992 --> 18:48.517
Who's that?

18:48.542 --> 18:49.536
It's me, Dad.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.517
Is it tea-time?

18:52.542 --> 18:54.336
I have to make it first, don't I?

18:58.621 --> 18:59.737
Can I have a biscuit?

19:01.581 --> 19:04.157
There aren't any biscuits.
You can have a butcher's rusk.

19:11.262 --> 19:13.957
My... bum hurts!

19:13.982 --> 19:16.977
Come on. All uncooked joints
off the table, soldier.

19:27.162 --> 19:28.636
Sullivan.

19:28.661 --> 19:30.857
You're working late.
Hm, I'm going away for a few days.

19:30.882 --> 19:33.127
I feel guilty about it.

19:33.152 --> 19:37.137
Well, I just wanted to ask you
about Fiona Symonds, the new girl.

19:37.162 --> 19:38.957
A couple of things.

19:38.982 --> 19:41.095
For a start, I'm pretty sure
she lied about why

19:41.095 --> 19:43.207
she wanted to work in the
Cabinet Office.

19:43.232 --> 19:44.646
She's not who she seems.

19:57.982 --> 19:59.597
Hey...

20:06.152 --> 20:09.000
OK... Who's he?

20:15.232 --> 20:17.776
Have you heard from your husband?

20:17.801 --> 20:21.566
Just to say he made
it and it's beautiful.

20:21.591 --> 20:23.857
Oh, also, I swapped with Jane.

20:23.882 --> 20:27.007
I'm taking notes for
the Palestine Committee.

20:27.032 --> 20:30.247
They still haven't got a clue about me.

20:46.642 --> 20:47.867
That's all?!

20:47.892 --> 20:50.077
I know, we were burgled.

20:50.102 --> 20:51.666
Need to find a better hiding place.

20:51.691 --> 20:52.627
I will.

20:54.052 --> 20:56.067
I can off-load a triple share this week.

20:56.092 --> 20:57.967
I found another shopkeeper.

20:57.992 --> 21:01.027
Anything to do with women's
clothing he'll buy. Instant cash.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.999
Good. Because they are fleecing us

21:02.999 --> 21:04.947
on submachine guns and explosives.

21:13.312 --> 21:16.766
Maybe he's her handler.

21:16.791 --> 21:19.047
Follow him.

21:19.072 --> 21:21.077
Find out who he is.

21:32.072 --> 21:34.446
And give the girl the photographs.

21:39.491 --> 21:40.786
Be sweet.

21:41.892 --> 21:43.747
She trusts you.

23:08.362 --> 23:10.097
Talk to your people in New York.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.347
We need more stockings in
London. Yeah, you got it.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.497
You reckon at some point
the post office will realise

23:16.522 --> 23:18.377
it's no longer Passover?

23:18.402 --> 23:19.627
No.

23:27.761 --> 23:31.377
I tell you, these Jews are terrorists!

23:31.402 --> 23:33.627
They're freedom fighters!

23:33.652 --> 23:37.217
I thought we agreed to
approach this calmly!

23:37.242 --> 23:39.547
That was before Jewish
terrorists disguised themselves

23:39.572 --> 23:42.057
as British soldiers,
bombed British intelligence offices

23:42.082 --> 23:43.656
and killed seven policemen!

23:43.681 --> 23:46.347
They're fighting a British
police state! Curfews, cordons...

23:46.372 --> 23:48.134
Booby traps, ambushes...
..raids, arbitrary arrests!

23:48.134 --> 23:49.896
..snipers, IEDs, shootings.

23:49.921 --> 23:52.337
The real truth is you British
are deliberately causing

23:52.362 --> 23:54.976
conflict between the Jews and
the Arabs to prolong your rule

23:55.001 --> 23:56.417
in the Middle East.

23:56.442 --> 24:04.017
Might I remind you chaps that in
1941, Britain was fighting alone?

24:04.042 --> 24:08.177
Is Britain willing to concede
she's finally too weak to make

24:08.202 --> 24:10.487
the Middle East her military monopoly?

24:10.512 --> 24:13.417
Exactly, John. Will she share control?

24:13.442 --> 24:16.746
Or is she conspiring to get
all that oil for herself?

24:16.771 --> 24:17.986
Says the oil man.

24:19.572 --> 24:21.057
Oh, very funny!

24:25.172 --> 24:28.106
How can we put the
humanity back into labour?

24:28.131 --> 24:31.776
Why should drudgery and
exploitation be inevitable?

24:31.801 --> 24:33.497
I want to encourage all of you to...

24:35.242 --> 24:36.137
Welcome, friend.

24:37.522 --> 24:40.347
I encourage all of you to
look at Marx's early writings.

24:40.372 --> 24:42.707
His starting place was very relatable.

24:42.732 --> 24:45.377
He's asking basic questions
about how to make the world

24:45.402 --> 24:47.976
a better place.
Then he offers some solutions.

25:07.011 --> 25:09.827
John. What brings you here, friend?

25:12.931 --> 25:16.497
Looking for some answers,
I guess. Right.

25:16.522 --> 25:18.427
The world's a bastard, isn't it?

25:20.732 --> 25:22.137
You know that, don't you?

25:23.962 --> 25:26.337
If you want to fix it,
you came to the right place.

25:28.572 --> 25:30.267
Have a cup of tea, comrade.

25:31.612 --> 25:32.866
Have a sandwich.

25:32.891 --> 25:35.267
Zoe, get John something
to eat and drink.

25:54.492 --> 25:56.267
Relax.

25:58.572 --> 26:00.507
You're with friends.

26:08.292 --> 26:10.297
Excuse me.

26:10.322 --> 26:12.187
Good weekend?

26:12.212 --> 26:15.187
Well, I worked through most of it.

26:15.212 --> 26:17.537
Although I did take the time
to listen to a lovely symphony

26:17.562 --> 26:20.786
on BBC. Mm. I'm more of a jazz girl.

26:20.811 --> 26:22.357
Why doesn't that surprise me?

26:26.402 --> 26:28.906
The National Trust is a
repellent institution.

26:33.921 --> 26:36.817
Pris, the minister wants to go
over the Bank of England speech.

26:36.842 --> 26:40.507
He's concerned the phrase "state
control" sounds too Soviet.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.187
Well, then I'll take it out.

26:45.412 --> 26:47.866
He's the one who said he wanted
to lay out to the public exactly

26:47.891 --> 26:49.147
what we were trying to do.

26:58.891 --> 27:00.747
You doing this to everyone? Yes, sir.

27:00.772 --> 27:02.976
We've been instructed to issue
bag checks, pocket checks.

27:03.001 --> 27:05.147
Please form a queue.

27:05.172 --> 27:07.547
We're trying to get through
this as quickly as we can.

27:10.322 --> 27:12.017
Oh.

27:12.042 --> 27:14.417
Oh, is this because of the
Russian they caught in Canada?

27:14.442 --> 27:16.577
Excuse me. Presumably.

27:16.602 --> 27:17.986
What's the hold up?

27:19.452 --> 27:20.547
They're checking bags.

27:22.042 --> 27:23.776
So sorry for this, everybody.

27:23.801 --> 27:25.417
Just a precaution.

27:37.402 --> 27:38.916
Thank you. Next, please.

27:46.652 --> 27:48.257
Oh, it's silly.

27:48.282 --> 27:49.627
What?

27:49.652 --> 27:52.147
I've forgotten my umbrella
and it's supposed to rain.

28:38.752 --> 28:40.517
Oh, fuck.

29:25.801 --> 29:28.477
Could you put me through
to Nicholas Sullivan?

29:28.502 --> 29:30.547
MI5

30:15.772 --> 30:17.427
What do you want?

30:19.372 --> 30:20.866
It's not me.

30:23.222 --> 30:24.786
I don't want anything.

30:30.302 --> 30:32.697
Freddie.

30:32.722 --> 30:34.986
Oh, Freddie, Freddie, Freddie.

30:35.011 --> 30:36.986
You fucking idiot, Freddie.

30:39.962 --> 30:41.337
I'm sorry.

30:44.572 --> 30:45.986
Freddie!

31:18.822 --> 31:21.267
You were right. It's Miss Garrick.

31:21.292 --> 31:23.547
She panicked at a bag check.
She pretended to go back

31:23.572 --> 31:25.877
to get an umbrella.
She returned with no umbrella.

31:25.902 --> 31:27.427
And it wasn't even raining outside.

31:27.452 --> 31:29.186
Now, I want the fucking negatives.

31:29.211 --> 31:31.316
Miss Garrick wasn't at the meetings.

31:31.341 --> 31:33.267
Someone gave her those documents.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.267
Presumably, the secretary.

31:35.292 --> 31:39.066
Jackson found out nothing following
her handler, so you're all I have.

31:39.091 --> 31:41.467
Just help me find a link, Then go.

31:41.492 --> 31:43.037
If you want.

31:43.062 --> 31:44.877
With the negatives.

31:47.442 --> 31:48.967
I love my brother.

31:50.202 --> 31:53.495
Yes. He's your twin.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.855
I have to go to work.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.214
Yes, you do.

32:04.109 --> 32:07.815
The Jews went to the West
and came back something else.

32:07.840 --> 32:11.575
We're not quarrelling with
anybody who comes from the West.

32:11.600 --> 32:15.575
But our old Jewish cousin has
come back with imperialistic ideas

32:15.600 --> 32:19.885
and is trying to enforce them,
first by British pressure...

32:19.910 --> 32:22.245
...then by American pressure.

32:22.270 --> 32:24.084
And now by terrorism.

32:26.229 --> 32:30.655
Nearly 30 years ago,
the British Government have promised to

32:30.680 --> 32:34.204
facilitate the establishment of
Jewish national home in Palestine.

32:35.950 --> 32:37.495
The Nazi plan

32:37.520 --> 32:40.785
to exterminate the Jewish
population of Europe have given new

32:40.810 --> 32:41.885
urgency to this promise.

32:43.189 --> 32:47.044
He pretends he has a particular
civilising mission for our

32:47.069 --> 32:48.365
"degenerate race".

32:48.390 --> 32:52.245
Well, that has been the pretension
of every power that wanted to

32:52.270 --> 32:54.525
colonise, that aimed at domination.

32:55.710 --> 32:58.135
My father,

32:58.160 --> 32:59.615
my mother...

33:01.480 --> 33:06.094
...my wife and my three
children were gassed in Belsen.

33:08.069 --> 33:12.284
You think we could ever
again think of Europe as home?

33:12.309 --> 33:14.535
Jews are from Palestine.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.505
And we will return.

33:16.530 --> 33:19.805
With or without your permission.

33:19.830 --> 33:23.735
The excuse has always been
that the people are backward.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.815
That one has a human
mission to elevate them.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.034
But we stand here and say no.

33:31.040 --> 33:36.414
It is hypocrisy to try to
alleviate the suffering of one people

33:36.439 --> 33:38.685
at the expense of another.

33:56.910 --> 34:01.294
Well, chaps, I think we'll
have this solved before lunch.

34:09.270 --> 34:11.414
Oh, it's funny? It's fucking funny?

34:14.710 --> 34:17.204
I don't know who you
think you are, Miss,

34:17.228 --> 34:19.043
but I know what you're going to do next.

34:19.069 --> 34:20.775
Get your things, and get out.

34:20.800 --> 34:23.083
And I don't just mean out of the
room, I mean out of the building.

34:23.109 --> 34:24.645
Now, hang on a second.

34:24.670 --> 34:26.855
I think perhaps just apologise.

34:26.880 --> 34:28.804
Yeah, just let her apologise.

34:28.830 --> 34:31.324
It's been a long day.
We've heard horrible stories.

34:32.600 --> 34:35.054
It's tough for a woman to take, right?

34:35.080 --> 34:36.804
I will not bloody apologise.

34:36.830 --> 34:38.804
You're in charge of this whole...

34:38.830 --> 34:40.605
You men.

34:40.630 --> 34:43.005
You're just waiting for
lunchtime, aren't you?

34:43.030 --> 34:45.574
Then you're waiting for dinner
time, so you can go home.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.925
And there are people,
skeletons, with no fucking homes.

34:48.949 --> 34:52.125
And they've seen things,
they've lived things and...

34:52.150 --> 34:54.245
Oh, what's the fucking point?

34:54.270 --> 34:56.804
What's the fucking point of any of you?!

34:56.830 --> 34:58.315
Go on, keep running the country.

34:58.340 --> 35:00.775
Keep running the world. Keep laughing.

35:00.800 --> 35:02.455
Don't stop fucking laughing!

35:02.480 --> 35:04.964
Listen... No, you listen.

35:04.989 --> 35:07.214
You don't know what the world is.

35:07.239 --> 35:10.575
Every time you get up,
get dressed and tie your tie in front of

35:10.600 --> 35:14.245
the mirror, just remember, the world
you move around in is imaginary.

35:15.800 --> 35:17.685
You don't know anything at all.

35:22.160 --> 35:25.765
Now what are we going to do for money?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.765
I don't want to work for the bloody
government anyway. I could get work.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.225
It would've been no better
in England, you know -

35:33.250 --> 35:34.665
if the Nazis had landed.

35:34.690 --> 35:38.194
We'd have had to take the
fucking cyanide pills, Mum.

35:38.219 --> 35:39.835
You don't know that.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.954
There were three Jews in
Guernsey, weren't there?

35:43.979 --> 35:46.605
Three Jews in Guernsey.

35:46.630 --> 35:48.224
And the Nazis got there, and

35:48.249 --> 35:50.525
the good English
people of Guernsey said,

35:50.550 --> 35:53.685
"Our three Jews live on this
street. Go and get them."

35:55.700 --> 35:59.414
So, they're dead in
Auschwitz, aren't they?

35:59.439 --> 36:02.044
Those fucking islanders
couldn't protect three women.

36:04.119 --> 36:07.495
They fucking hate Jews here,
same as everyone else.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.935
What did you do?

37:03.960 --> 37:05.214
I don't want to die.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.855
No-one is going to die.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.954
She made me feel like a total idiot.

37:45.979 --> 37:48.964
I mean, we were just
letting off steam, but...

37:53.270 --> 37:55.135
I heard she got herself fired.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.964
What does that mean?

37:57.989 --> 38:01.135
Uh, if she'd apologised,
they'd have let her stay.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.414
Oh. Lucky her, in a way.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.245
Some people are just trapped.

38:10.270 --> 38:11.785
I'm glad she's not one of them.

38:15.359 --> 38:16.605
Are you...

38:16.630 --> 38:18.214
..one of them?

38:43.800 --> 38:45.344
Hugh...

38:47.160 --> 38:48.354
I'm sorry.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.455
I'm sorry.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.885
It's OK.

38:59.560 --> 39:03.164
There is... something else we could try.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.585
I mean, I mean, only if you want to.

39:06.610 --> 39:08.945
It's... it's quite embarrassing.

39:49.010 --> 39:51.214
Anything I can do for you?
I haven't quite finished

39:51.239 --> 39:53.445
nationalising coal,
but hopefully by this afternoon.

39:55.319 --> 39:56.945
Come into my office for a second.

40:22.449 --> 40:24.455
You work so hard.

40:24.480 --> 40:26.375
I could've used you during the war.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.344
Where were you?

40:30.369 --> 40:32.935
I was at Cambridge.
I think I've already mentioned.

40:34.610 --> 40:37.855
I heard you trained with the SOE.
Who did you hear that from?

40:37.880 --> 40:40.055
Mr Sullivan mentioned it.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.065
Oh, I just...

40:42.090 --> 40:45.084
They told us not to say
anything after the war, so...

40:45.109 --> 40:47.975
We're not meant to
broadcast it, you know? Hm.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.495
But MI5 know everything.

40:49.520 --> 40:50.865
I hope.

40:54.760 --> 40:58.505
It's just awfully
impressive, that's all.

40:58.530 --> 41:00.414
I wanted to serve my country.

41:00.439 --> 41:02.865
But in such an interesting way.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.375
You must be very ambitious.

41:08.080 --> 41:09.945
Well, why else would you have lied

41:09.970 --> 41:12.015
about David Hennessey
making passes at you?

41:14.319 --> 41:15.655
David likes boys.

41:19.490 --> 41:22.655
I am ambitious.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.535
I wanted to be in the
Cabinet Office. I'm very sorry.

41:33.170 --> 41:34.635
All is forgiven.

41:37.920 --> 41:39.344
OK.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.525
Listen, I wonder if
you'd come to dinner?

41:45.550 --> 41:48.775
I put together these
little evenings at my house,

41:48.800 --> 41:50.245
and I'd love to include you.

41:50.270 --> 41:52.055
We talk a little politics.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.575
Not so neutral.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.294
Get to know each other properly.

41:58.010 --> 41:59.294
Well, I'd love to.

42:22.830 --> 42:25.245
I feel her eyes on me.

42:25.270 --> 42:27.535
Maybe she is just... ambitious.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.985
Quite a few girls work for the SOE.
It doesn't mean anything.

42:32.010 --> 42:33.935
Doesn't have to mean anything.

42:36.800 --> 42:39.294
I'm probably just being paranoid.

42:41.280 --> 42:43.495
Job makes you paranoid. I hate it.

42:43.520 --> 42:45.855
God, I hate it.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.575
Sick of it.

42:50.910 --> 42:54.995
Though I joked with Sullivan,
"She's not one of yours, is she?"

42:56.449 --> 42:57.655
He said she wasn't.

42:59.109 --> 43:00.725
He wouldn't tell me if she was.

43:08.160 --> 43:10.055
It's fine.

43:10.080 --> 43:14.065
She'll come to dinner,
and if she's MI5, she won't be very

43:14.090 --> 43:16.294
experienced
- she'll start snooping around.

43:16.319 --> 43:20.375
And she'll slip up. And if she
slips up, I can tell him, can't I?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.495
There's nothing wrong with that.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.815
It's just... self-preservation.

43:27.840 --> 43:29.525
It's preserving the cause.

43:31.199 --> 43:33.665
Because you know the
minute I mention it to him,

43:33.690 --> 43:35.535
he'll have no reservations
about getting rid of her.

43:36.840 --> 43:38.135
Just like that.

43:40.680 --> 43:42.815
And a whole...

43:42.840 --> 43:44.695
...person...

43:46.100 --> 43:50.065
...a whole characterful life and soul"
