00:01.417 --> 00:03.651
Attention, Cloud 9 shoppers,

00:03.653 --> 00:05.553
the store has been
closed for 20 minutes.

00:05.555 --> 00:07.822
Many of us would like to leave.

00:07.824 --> 00:10.258
So, if you're still in the store,

00:10.260 --> 00:11.926
you're being a dick.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.762
Don't be a dick.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.430
It's tough, because I have to live

00:15.432 --> 00:16.931
with this trash can, you know?

00:16.933 --> 00:18.066
Right. No, I get it.

00:18.068 --> 00:20.602
It's a very big decision.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.838
So, you know, maybe you could
go home tonight, sleep on it,

00:23.840 --> 00:25.840
and decide tomorrow?

00:25.842 --> 00:30.779
No, "decide tomorrow"
is what I said yesterday.

00:30.781 --> 00:33.014
If I don't get home and
study for my midterm,

00:33.016 --> 00:35.150
I'm totally screwed.

00:35.152 --> 00:36.651
Oh, hey, you look so cute.

00:36.653 --> 00:38.219
Thank you.

00:38.221 --> 00:39.954
It's my senior dance recital tonight.

00:39.956 --> 00:42.190
What? Why didn't you tell us?

00:42.192 --> 00:45.393
Well, I can't perform
because of, you know, this.

00:45.395 --> 00:45.728
Oh.

00:45.828 --> 00:48.378
But I'm gonna go and
cheer on the other girls.

00:48.449 --> 00:51.783
Yeah, if this bozo
ever leaves the store.

00:51.785 --> 00:55.587
Hey, Myrtle, go bust out
your hysterectomy story.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.556
It's all right. I got it.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.894
It was 1953,

01:02.896 --> 01:06.565
and medical science was all the rage.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.402
The thing is, you just sent
us the shipment of signs now,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.471
and I'd hate to keep people late

01:12.473 --> 01:15.440
on a Friday evening to hang them all up.

01:15.442 --> 01:19.645
So, if anyone gets this message,
could you call me back, please?

01:19.647 --> 01:21.013
It's Glenn.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.514
- Sir...
- Oh, sorry.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.882
Oh, oh, so sorry, sir.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.217
- Sir, I can't quite...
- Oh, I am in the way.

01:25.219 --> 01:26.652
- Yeah.
- Duty calls.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.153
- Sorry.
- I can't seem to...

01:28.155 --> 01:29.688
There's a spot right over there.

01:29.690 --> 01:30.756
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.391
Hey, is that "Die Hard 2"?

01:32.393 --> 01:33.392
That is the best "Die Hard."

01:33.394 --> 01:34.626
Have a heavenly night.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.439
Okay.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.366
- Whoo
- Hoo!

01:41.368 --> 01:45.270
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

01:45.272 --> 01:47.773
Oh, great job, Mateo. Great job.

01:47.775 --> 01:51.309
Hey, we're all staying
late to do more work.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.511
I'm so sorry.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.279
I just found out about it.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.315
I feel terrible about this.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.883
Whoo-hoo!

02:04.028 --> 02:06.679
I'm stuck at work for an
hour or two, but save my seat.

02:06.713 --> 02:08.279
I'll be there as soon as I can.

02:08.281 --> 02:10.048
You have to get here, bitch.

02:10.050 --> 02:11.716
I know, bitch.

02:11.718 --> 02:14.352
Birds, it's Mommy. Listen up.

02:14.354 --> 02:19.057
Scout, Taffy, FDR, Pikachu,
you guys are in charge,

02:19.059 --> 02:21.159
so act like the leaders
I know that you are.

02:21.161 --> 02:25.229
Now, cockatoos, I assume
you can't hear me right now

02:25.231 --> 02:27.465
since you should all be asleep already.

02:27.467 --> 02:30.168
Okay, heads down.

02:33.506 --> 02:37.742
♪ Too la loo ra loo ral ♪

02:37.744 --> 02:42.580
♪ Too la loo ra li ♪

02:42.582 --> 02:44.215
Ooh, corporate messed up.

02:44.217 --> 02:46.417
Those are the same
signs we just took down.

02:46.419 --> 02:47.986
I don't think so.

02:47.988 --> 02:50.054
Mm-Hmm.

02:50.056 --> 02:51.923
Nope, they say the old signs

02:51.925 --> 02:55.360
were this pale, outdated
color called "Glossy Dolphin."

02:55.362 --> 02:57.962
The new ones are a bold, exciting color

02:57.964 --> 03:00.131
called "Glossy Dolphin B."

03:03.069 --> 03:04.435
This is kind of fun, right?

03:04.437 --> 03:06.037
Being up high like this?

03:06.039 --> 03:08.506
Reminds me of my indoor
rock-climbing days.

03:08.508 --> 03:11.910
I just need to get home
to study for my midterm.

03:11.912 --> 03:13.745
Midterm.

03:13.747 --> 03:15.747
- That takes me back.
- Mm-hmm.

03:15.749 --> 03:18.483
Cramming for tests... or trying to.

03:18.485 --> 03:20.351
Half the time, I'd just
end up getting drunk

03:20.353 --> 03:21.819
in someone's dorm room

03:21.821 --> 03:25.256
and spend the whole night
having "deep conversations."

03:25.258 --> 03:28.293
That's so fun.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.762
Did I ever tell you the
story about that one time

03:30.764 --> 03:32.363
when I went to college as a grown-up

03:32.365 --> 03:35.400
and I had to go work and I
had all these responsibilities?

03:35.402 --> 03:37.302
It's a laugh riot.

03:39.438 --> 03:41.239
You don't have to hold
the ladder, you know.

03:41.241 --> 03:43.374
I'm not gonna let you fall...

03:43.376 --> 03:45.243
not on my watch.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.551
What?

03:57.958 --> 03:59.924
- Oh, hey, look at that.
- Ooh.

03:59.926 --> 04:01.326
Ooh, cool move, cowboy.

04:01.328 --> 04:02.360
What, this?

04:02.362 --> 04:04.696
I was born with a drill in my hand.

04:04.698 --> 04:07.799
My family used to own
a hardware store...

04:07.801 --> 04:09.367
Sturgis and Sons?

04:09.369 --> 04:10.468
Oh.

04:10.470 --> 04:12.136
Yeah, for 59 years,

04:12.138 --> 04:15.139
the name "Sturgis" was
synonymous with tools...

04:15.141 --> 04:17.875
Well, until Cloud 9
moved in up the street,

04:17.877 --> 04:19.944
and then a month later,
we lost everything.

04:19.946 --> 04:21.946
Hey, has anyone seen the laser level?

04:21.947 --> 04:25.049
Doesn't it make you a little
angry to be working for them?

04:25.051 --> 04:28.586
Oh, I don't waste my time with anger.

04:28.588 --> 04:30.254
Oh.

04:30.256 --> 04:32.724
Look at that. I hit my finger.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.294
That looked pretty serious.

04:36.296 --> 04:37.528
Did the lights go out?

04:37.530 --> 04:39.731
Oh, come on.

04:39.733 --> 04:41.766
Glenn, what's up with the lights?

04:41.768 --> 04:43.067
I'm kind of in a rush.

04:43.069 --> 04:45.603
Actually, the lights are
controlled by corporate.

04:45.605 --> 04:46.704
What?

04:46.706 --> 04:47.905
Every night at a certain time,

04:47.907 --> 04:51.009
the lights dim, and the
doors automatically lock.

04:51.011 --> 04:52.210
All the doors lock?

04:52.212 --> 04:54.012
Yep.

04:54.014 --> 04:56.014
Excuse me.

04:56.016 --> 04:58.349
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

04:58.351 --> 05:01.586
Oh, no, no, no, no. Are you kidding me?

05:01.588 --> 05:03.488
No!

05:04.300 --> 05:07.502
Oh, God.

05:08.369 --> 05:11.771
Okay, the bad news is we're locked in.

05:11.773 --> 05:13.673
Dina and I will go to my office

05:13.675 --> 05:15.741
and look for the lock override code.

05:15.743 --> 05:18.878
In the meantime, you guys
keep putting up signs.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.513
You can make a game out of it.

05:20.515 --> 05:24.884
You can call the game "Signage Fever."

05:24.886 --> 05:26.853
I am not playing that game.

05:26.855 --> 05:28.788
- Guys...
- No.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.056
You don't even know
what I was gonna say.

05:30.058 --> 05:32.125
I know that every time
you start a sentence

05:32.127 --> 05:33.626
with, "Guys," you end it with,

05:33.628 --> 05:36.028
"Let's make the best of
this," or, "Let's have fun."

05:36.030 --> 05:39.732
You never say, "Guys,
this really sucks."

05:39.734 --> 05:41.701
Guys, we have the entire
store to ourselves.

05:41.703 --> 05:43.369
We could do whatever we want.

05:43.371 --> 05:45.104
If we decide that this is gonna be fun,

05:45.106 --> 05:47.173
then this is gonna be fun.

05:47.175 --> 05:50.710
So, if you're with me,
I will see all of you

05:50.712 --> 05:53.062
in the fun zone.

05:53.948 --> 05:55.148
"Fun zone"?

05:55.150 --> 05:57.683
Sometimes I just
really want to slap him.

05:57.685 --> 06:01.020
I think it was on one of
these memos from corporate.

06:01.022 --> 06:02.221
Here.

06:02.223 --> 06:04.991
"Union buzzwords."
"How to spot a union."

06:04.993 --> 06:06.259
"Anti-union activity."

06:06.261 --> 06:07.693
"What to do if you
hear the word 'union.'"

06:07.695 --> 06:09.662
"Reporting union activity."

06:09.664 --> 06:12.598
"List of toxic food recalls"?

06:12.600 --> 06:15.835
I don't remember doing any food recalls.

06:15.837 --> 06:17.737
What?

06:17.739 --> 06:20.473
"Addendum of policy changes
to employee handbook...

06:20.475 --> 06:22.408
Relationships between
supervisors and subordinates

06:22.410 --> 06:26.045
no longer forbidden, now
just strongly discouraged."

06:26.047 --> 06:28.181
Yeah, words. Oh, here it is.

06:28.183 --> 06:30.316
"Please detach the accompanying card

06:30.318 --> 06:31.417
and keep in a safe place."

06:31.419 --> 06:33.753
And, look, I wrote, "Like in your car,"

06:33.755 --> 06:35.521
and then I underlined "car."

06:35.523 --> 06:37.523
Oh, that means it's just outsi...

06:37.525 --> 06:38.725
Oh.

06:38.727 --> 06:40.159
Okay, the bad news

06:40.161 --> 06:43.129
is I left the card with the
code in my glove compartment.

06:43.131 --> 06:45.364
So I called my wife to come get it,

06:45.366 --> 06:47.099
but we only have one car,

06:47.101 --> 06:49.769
so she has to wait for
her sister to come get her.

06:49.771 --> 06:51.070
You guys, there's someone out there.

06:51.072 --> 06:53.239
Oh, my God. Hey! Hey!

06:53.241 --> 06:56.409
Oh! Oh!

06:56.411 --> 06:59.879
Can you get something from my car?

07:01.616 --> 07:04.183
Boop-boop-boop... we
need a boop-boop-boop-boop.

07:05.587 --> 07:07.653
Whoo!

07:07.655 --> 07:10.456
- You guys are missing out.
- Mm.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.692
What a unique experience it must be,

07:12.694 --> 07:15.361
moving around a store on wheels.

07:15.363 --> 07:18.097
The key's above the tire.

07:18.099 --> 07:21.868
Get card from glove compartment.

07:21.870 --> 07:23.836
Bring card here.

07:28.209 --> 07:32.178
Whoo! We're gonna get out of here!

07:32.180 --> 07:34.080
- Yes!
- Yes!

07:34.082 --> 07:35.548
- Is it there? Is it there?
- Wait, wait... oh, good.

07:35.550 --> 07:36.749
Look, he's got the key.

07:36.751 --> 07:38.918
Why is he getting in the driver's seat?

07:38.920 --> 07:41.220
No, you don't need to start the engine

07:41.222 --> 07:43.256
to open the glove compartment.

07:43.258 --> 07:45.625
No, you don't need to move the car.

07:45.627 --> 07:47.426
Wait. Where are you going?

07:47.428 --> 07:48.795
Where's he going?

07:48.797 --> 07:51.731
What the... where is the...

07:55.836 --> 07:58.738
Cruising through the fun zone...

07:58.740 --> 07:59.972
Hey, can you maybe...

07:59.974 --> 08:03.209
Whoo! Ha ha!

08:03.211 --> 08:05.444
Okay.

08:12.286 --> 08:14.754
Part of me's glad I missed the recital.

08:14.756 --> 08:16.856
I've been looking
forward to my senior dance

08:16.858 --> 08:18.191
since sixth grade,

08:18.193 --> 08:21.294
and it would've sucked to
just sit there and watch.

08:21.296 --> 08:23.696
I'm not saying that I regret this baby.

08:23.698 --> 08:25.505
I just wish that I'd had it later...

08:25.605 --> 08:28.740
or sooner, like a lot of my friends.

08:28.742 --> 08:29.841
You know what I mean?

08:30.038 --> 08:31.786
Uh, I do, yes,

08:31.788 --> 08:34.522
and I think each and every
one of us has regrets.

08:34.524 --> 08:36.091
I'll go next.

08:36.092 --> 08:38.360
I regret doing Semester at Sea

08:38.361 --> 08:40.128
instead of just picking one country

08:40.130 --> 08:42.330
and really absorbing the culture.

08:42.332 --> 08:43.732
Who else?

08:43.734 --> 08:45.433
Well, my only regrets are the
times I over thought things

08:45.435 --> 08:47.402
and didn't go for what I wanted.

08:47.404 --> 08:49.704
- There you go.
- I mean, why fight nature?

08:49.706 --> 08:51.273
We're all just animals, right?

08:53.476 --> 08:56.744
I regret not rescuing my
twin brother from that wave.

08:58.081 --> 08:59.948
So there you have it, guys.

08:59.950 --> 09:04.519
We are learning lots about each other.

09:04.521 --> 09:05.921
What about you, Ame?

09:05.923 --> 09:09.157
What are you... What's
your biggest regret?

09:09.159 --> 09:11.326
I guess I regret not going to college

09:11.328 --> 09:14.095
when I was younger so that
I could have lots of stories

09:14.097 --> 09:16.665
to annoy my coworkers with.

09:16.667 --> 09:18.133
Hey, well, at least it's quiet.

09:18.135 --> 09:20.910
We don't have to listen to that
stupid Muzak they make us play.

09:20.988 --> 09:24.122
I actually kind of like the music.

09:24.125 --> 09:27.227
It makes me feel like
I'm on hold all day.

09:27.229 --> 09:29.329
Glenn, you like everything
about this store.

09:29.331 --> 09:31.030
- That's weird, man.
- Well...

09:31.032 --> 09:34.457
I don't like everything
about this store.

09:35.470 --> 09:39.672
Truth be told, the backslash
in the employee's bathroom...

09:39.674 --> 09:42.408
It's, like, B-minus, at best.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.204
That's the only thing that
bugs you about this company?

09:46.214 --> 09:51.618
Well, I guess the aisles are
a bit too close together...

09:51.620 --> 09:53.419
and sometimes the folks in charge

09:53.421 --> 09:56.456
don't treat me like I'm a
human being with feelings.

09:56.458 --> 09:58.625
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah,
that's a bummer.

09:58.627 --> 10:02.161
Sturgis and Sons was a community.

10:02.163 --> 10:04.430
Customers would be like, "Hi, Glenn."

10:04.432 --> 10:06.766
"Do you have a screw in
such-and-such a size?"

10:06.768 --> 10:09.068
And I'd say, "I think so."

10:09.070 --> 10:11.170
"Maybe ask my dad."

10:11.172 --> 10:12.539
It was paradise.

10:12.541 --> 10:14.774
You know what else
I regret? That time...

10:14.776 --> 10:17.143
And then this chain moves in.

10:17.145 --> 10:19.979
I mean, where do they get
off? Keep us late in...

10:19.981 --> 10:21.581
locked in the dark, you know,

10:21.583 --> 10:23.983
all in service of the bottom line.

10:23.985 --> 10:25.919
Yeah. Go.

10:25.921 --> 10:28.555
- I hate this tie.
- Yeah.

10:28.557 --> 10:30.223
I hate this shirt!

10:30.225 --> 10:32.659
- Okay.
- Isn't that his shirt?

10:32.661 --> 10:34.027
Oh, you're going a little too far now.

10:34.029 --> 10:38.531
And I hate Regional
Manager Dicky Larson,

10:38.533 --> 10:41.801
but you know what I hate most of all?

10:41.803 --> 10:43.870
I hate Cloud 9.

10:43.872 --> 10:45.872

10:58.620 --> 11:01.654
Oh, no, this is damaged.

Okay, but... You know, like that,

"Never have I ever eaten human flesh."

11:31.316 --> 11:32.448
Oh, no, no, no.

11:32.450 --> 11:34.317
You drink if you have done it.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.819
Mm-hmm. I understand.

11:36.821 --> 11:37.954

11:37.956 --> 11:40.923

hooked up in the store.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.027
Really?

11:45.029 --> 11:46.829
You remember last week

11:46.831 --> 11:50.299
when Jerusha came by to
talk about the mortgage?

11:50.301 --> 11:51.434
Oh.

11:51.436 --> 11:52.835
- In my office?
- Yeah, boy.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.606
- Gross.
- Wait, wait. There's more.

11:56.608 --> 11:57.907
We had sex.

11:57.909 --> 11:59.542
Yeah, man.

lab is a great spot.

12:07.986 --> 12:09.886
- Yeah.
- What? Really?

12:09.888 --> 12:11.687
Yeah, it's dark. It's private.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.323
Sometimes you get to see
people's naked photos.

12:14.325 --> 12:15.491
When I first started here,

12:15.493 --> 12:17.627
we just called the lab the "bang room"

12:17.629 --> 12:18.761
because, you know...

12:18.763 --> 12:20.563
the banging.

12:20.565 --> 12:21.964
I banged in there.

12:21.966 --> 12:24.367
Okay.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.769
- Really?
- I did.

18:09.748 --> 18:12.178
- That's great.
- I just got pregnant.

18:12.319 --> 18:15.954
And then I got married,
and then Adam had dreams,

18:15.956 --> 18:17.756

18:17.758 --> 18:19.291
