01:47.767 --> 01:50.333
- There's all kinds
of slang words for prison.

01:50.400 --> 01:53.667
The joint, the slammer,
the big house.

01:53.734 --> 01:57.433
But my personal favorite
is the clink.

01:58.967 --> 02:00.400
That's because
the word comes from

02:00.467 --> 02:03.567
the sound the chains made
back in the 1400s.

02:03.633 --> 02:07.233
They had these big-ass,
motherfucking iron chains.

02:07.300 --> 02:09.200
The prisoners
weren't allowed to talk,

02:09.266 --> 02:10.834
so when they moved
around the dungeon,

02:10.900 --> 02:13.567
all you heard was "clink".

02:14.667 --> 02:15.967
- Listen up!

02:16.033 --> 02:17.934
The following are
being transferred

02:18.000 --> 02:20.300
out of Emerald City.

02:20.367 --> 02:24.333
96G333, Guccione.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.100
91H481, Harden.

02:30.166 --> 02:34.834
94S727, Schirner.

02:34.900 --> 02:38.166
Get your stuff
and follow Officer Titon.

02:39.433 --> 02:41.767
- Yo, so long, suckers!

02:43.133 --> 02:44.266
- Psst!

03:18.834 --> 03:20.934
- Blow me.

03:42.166 --> 03:44.767
- You gotta fix this
damn thing by noon.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.000
- Querns.

03:47.066 --> 03:49.600
How can you condone
what Adebisi is doing?

03:49.667 --> 03:52.100
The drugs, the sex?

03:52.166 --> 03:55.133
He even has a curtain across
his cell to hide his sins.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.533
- I don't have to explain
why I condone,

03:57.600 --> 04:00.300
what I condone to you.

04:00.367 --> 04:02.834
- No, you don't.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.800
But I can go to the warden.

04:04.867 --> 04:07.900
- I can send you
to the Hole.

04:07.967 --> 04:11.066
- You know, others have
tried to silence me.

04:11.133 --> 04:13.667
- Others ain't me, Said.

04:13.734 --> 04:15.533
If you wanna move
to another unit,

04:15.600 --> 04:17.200
I can arrange that.

04:17.266 --> 04:19.467
If not,
do what you do best--

04:19.533 --> 04:21.300
pray to Allah.

04:21.367 --> 04:23.800
The rest of the time,
keep your mouth shut.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.700
- Arif...

04:56.834 --> 04:58.500
Look out there.

05:03.133 --> 05:04.667
Look!

05:06.567 --> 05:08.100
Can you see
what's going on?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.500
- Yes.

05:09.567 --> 05:11.834
- Then how can you
just sit there?

05:11.900 --> 05:14.734
You said you wanted to lead.

05:14.800 --> 05:19.567
Well, in the name
of all that's holy...

05:19.633 --> 05:21.367
lead.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.433
- All right, okay,
bye-bye.

05:25.500 --> 05:27.767
Bye.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.667
- You're on.

05:37.667 --> 05:40.000
- I been trying to get five
minutes with you for days.

05:40.066 --> 05:41.667
- Well, you got 'em now.

05:41.734 --> 05:43.400
Don't waste 'em
by complaining.

05:43.467 --> 05:46.100
- First off, when you
set up this new system,

05:46.166 --> 05:48.300
why wasn't I named
one of the trustees?

05:48.367 --> 05:52.066
The Muslim population
constitutes 18% of Oz.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.367
As their leader,

05:53.433 --> 05:55.600
I expect some sort
of representation.

05:55.667 --> 05:59.133
- I know the Muslim
population is large,

05:59.200 --> 06:03.233
but as a force,
you all seem...

06:03.300 --> 06:04.867
rudderless.

06:04.934 --> 06:07.333
- You wait, Querns.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.233
You'll feel the full
force of our power.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.734
- Are you threatening me?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.533
Hmm?

06:16.600 --> 06:18.900
Hmm?

06:18.967 --> 06:21.100
Huh?

06:21.166 --> 06:26.266
Huh? Are you
threatening me?

06:26.333 --> 06:28.433
Get your ass out of here.

06:49.266 --> 06:51.667
- But me and Supreme,
we was just talkin'.

06:51.734 --> 06:53.967
- I don't want you
anywhere near him.

06:54.033 --> 06:55.700
- But I was just listening
to what he had to say.

06:55.767 --> 06:58.000
- That's an order.

06:58.066 --> 07:00.166
- Yes...sir.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.066
- Now go.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.800
I must pray.

07:30.467 --> 07:32.967
- And just then,
I heard a voice,

07:33.033 --> 07:34.800
a thunderous voice
with like an easy E

07:34.867 --> 07:36.900
type of nasalness saying,

07:36.967 --> 07:39.000
"Truth casts no shadows

07:39.066 --> 07:42.400
"because it soaks sun
like fava sponges.

07:42.467 --> 07:45.633
"Do bungee-cord jumpings
into the abyss.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.533
Hold truth
tightly in your fist."

07:51.467 --> 07:54.266
- What I tell you,
Ketchum?

07:54.333 --> 07:56.100
- My name's Supreme Allah.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.100
- Your name is Kevin Ketchum.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.700
You're nothing but
a low-life corner boy.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.467
- What are you, Arif?

08:03.533 --> 08:07.066
Other than a...
Kareem Said wannabe?

08:07.133 --> 08:09.300
- I'm not warning
you again.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.066
- Adebisi.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.600
- That's me.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.834
- We need to talk about
this guy Ketchum.

08:22.900 --> 08:25.200
- Oh, yeah,
what about him?

08:25.266 --> 08:27.166
- He's a danger
to us both.

08:27.233 --> 08:29.633
- Yeah?
How so?

08:29.700 --> 08:32.233
He's making all these converts
of my people, yours.

08:32.300 --> 08:34.000
- No worry.

08:34.066 --> 08:35.233
- You should be.

08:35.300 --> 08:37.533
Pretty soon, they'll
be following his orders.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.133
- Well, me and Supreme,
we have an understanding.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.300
- You can't trust him.

08:41.367 --> 08:43.700
- What are you suggesting?

08:43.767 --> 08:45.633
- You should do
what you usually do

08:45.700 --> 08:47.667
when you face an enemy.

08:47.734 --> 08:49.467
- You mean kill him?

08:53.066 --> 08:56.433
I thought you Muslims
were against murder.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.000
Ah, yeah, but it's okay
if I kill him for you, eh?

09:01.533 --> 09:04.266
- Adebisi!
- No.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.633
My answer is no.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.900
You want him dead,
grab a knife, eh?

09:35.033 --> 09:36.200
- Morning.

09:36.266 --> 09:38.300
- Hey, Sean, what
are you doing here?

09:38.367 --> 09:40.200
- The new guy running
Em City, Querns,

09:40.266 --> 09:43.834
well...he and I came
to a parting of the ways.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.500
- Oh, yeah?
- The warden reassigned me

09:45.567 --> 09:47.000
to reception,
but I'll tell ya,

09:47.066 --> 09:48.433
I'm not cut out
for desk work.

09:48.500 --> 09:51.900
My guess?
I'll be gone in a week or two.

09:51.967 --> 09:53.667
- Hey, listen.

09:53.734 --> 09:57.467
You know what I said
about being mad at you

09:57.533 --> 09:59.200
because you didn't quit
when I was fired?

09:59.266 --> 10:00.467
That's bullshit.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.967
Given my behavior
at the time,

10:03.033 --> 10:04.166
how could I possibly
pass judgment

10:04.233 --> 10:05.967
on what anyone
else did?

10:06.033 --> 10:09.100
- Tim, you...
you sound so enlightened.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.166
You find God?

10:10.233 --> 10:13.333
- Better.
An affordable shrink.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.467
Let's have dinner tonight.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.734
- Okay, but you're buying.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.066
- Okay.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.667
Hey, Andrea.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.233
It's morning already?

10:29.300 --> 10:31.100
- Quiet night?

10:31.166 --> 10:34.533
- If you count two fistfights
and some anal penetration

10:34.600 --> 10:36.900
as quiet, yeah.

10:36.967 --> 10:39.100
- Who got in the fights?

10:39.166 --> 10:42.800
- That biker Hoyt and one
of those Irish boys, Keenan.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.400
- Cocksucker!

10:52.467 --> 10:54.633
- Fuck you,
fucking rapist!

11:04.200 --> 11:06.567
- All right, all right,
quiet down, come on!

11:08.567 --> 11:10.967
- Martin, what's up?

11:11.033 --> 11:12.967
- As you know,
Sean Murphy has been asked

11:13.033 --> 11:14.867
to transfer out of Em City,

11:14.934 --> 11:17.567
and I've made Travis Smith
my new C.O. Supervisor.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.200
The problem is, some of the
officers are loyal to Murphy.

11:20.266 --> 11:23.266
So I'm asking you
to move these C.O.s out

11:23.333 --> 11:25.000
and bring these in.

11:26.233 --> 11:28.700
- Okay, done.
Um, Mobay!

11:30.033 --> 11:31.800
I need these transfers
taken care of right away.

11:31.867 --> 11:33.367
- Yes, sir.

11:34.467 --> 11:35.967
- So how's
the campaign going?

11:36.033 --> 11:37.533
- Great.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.133
- I say we talk to the warden.

11:39.200 --> 11:42.900
- Nah, he's got his head
up Devlin's ass.

11:42.967 --> 11:46.233
He's not paying attention
to our problems here.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.100
We oughta
go to the union.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.934
- Huh? Go to
the union about what?

11:50.000 --> 11:51.266
- My pal Querns

11:51.333 --> 11:53.667
is replacing
all the C.O.s in Em City

11:53.734 --> 11:55.166
with people of
his own choosing.

11:55.233 --> 11:56.800
- That's his right.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.200
- Yeah, only he's choosing
all black guys.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.900
- Oh.

12:01.967 --> 12:03.567
Well, good news is,

12:03.633 --> 12:05.934
you can come work
for me in Unit B.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.867
- Really?

12:07.934 --> 12:09.834
- Yeah, I could use
the muscle, believe me.

12:09.900 --> 12:11.633
I'll go to Glynn,
I'll make the transfers.

12:11.700 --> 12:14.033
- Thanks, Tim.
- Hey, were a great team,

12:14.100 --> 12:15.767
right?
- Yeah.

12:17.734 --> 12:19.500
- Okay.

12:19.567 --> 12:21.967
I'll put
the paperwork through.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.567
- Good.
Hey, Leo.

12:23.633 --> 12:25.600
- What?

12:25.667 --> 12:27.700
- Doesn't it bother you that
Querns is putting together

12:27.767 --> 12:29.667
an exclusively
black staff?

12:29.734 --> 12:31.834
- Look, I told the man
he could run his unit

12:31.900 --> 12:34.967
any way he wanted as long
as the violence was kept down.

12:35.033 --> 12:37.066
Okay? You know,
since Querns took over,

12:37.133 --> 12:39.467
there's been no significant
nonsense in Em City.

12:39.533 --> 12:42.900
- Yeah. how long
is that gonna last?

12:46.633 --> 12:49.433
- There's that Romanian place
around the corner.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.700
It's a dump
but the food's delicious.

12:51.767 --> 12:54.200
Especially
that ciulama de miel.

12:54.266 --> 12:57.333
- Well, well,
Frick and Frack.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.300
I hear you two choir boys

12:59.367 --> 13:01.233
are working together
again in Unit B.

13:01.300 --> 13:02.667
- That's right.

13:02.734 --> 13:04.433
- I just got
a transfer myself.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.900
Seems the warden
was in a tizzy

13:05.967 --> 13:09.066
'cause Querns has
all black C.O.s in Em City.

13:12.066 --> 13:13.700
- You're gonna work
in Emerald City?

13:13.767 --> 13:15.400
- Yeah.

13:15.467 --> 13:17.066
Life's full of ironies,
isn't it?

13:37.433 --> 13:39.166
- For Christ's sake,
Ginzburg,

13:39.233 --> 13:40.800
I can't take it anymore!

13:40.867 --> 13:42.900
All day, all night
with the vomiting.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.233
Why don't you
hurry up and die?

13:45.300 --> 13:47.166
Jesus!

13:47.233 --> 13:50.000
- I just came from
seeing Nat Ginzburg.

13:50.066 --> 13:51.433
- What's he want?

13:51.500 --> 13:53.133
- You know he has AIDS.

13:53.200 --> 13:56.633
- Yeah, but he refuses to
move to the AIDS ward.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.633
- Gloria tells me
he hasn't got long to live,

13:58.700 --> 14:00.900
but he's tired of
fighting the disease,

14:00.967 --> 14:04.567
so
he asked me to ask you

14:04.633 --> 14:08.233
if it would be possible
to move up the execution.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.300
- Move up the execution?

14:10.367 --> 14:11.867
- Yeah.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.834
- No one's ever asked
to be executed early.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.934
I mean, the court
set a specific date.

14:19.000 --> 14:20.700
There's no legal
precedent to change it.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.233
- So let's start a precedent.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.867
-  You're encouraging
me to do this,

14:25.934 --> 14:27.734
given your position against
capital punishment?

14:27.800 --> 14:30.734
- The man is dying, Leo.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.967
I believe,
in this particular case,

14:33.033 --> 14:36.333
ending his life would be a...
a blessing.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.233
- That's euthanasia.

14:38.300 --> 14:41.667
I thought your church
was against euthanasia.

14:41.734 --> 14:44.200
- My church is against
a lot of things I'm not.

14:46.867 --> 14:50.266
- Okay...
I'll call the lawyers.

14:50.333 --> 14:52.433
- Good.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.266
- State troopers closed
Bear Mountain this morning

14:54.333 --> 14:55.767
after a reported sighting

14:55.834 --> 14:58.000
of escaped convict
Miguel Alvarez.

14:58.066 --> 15:00.266
An extensive search
was launched, but Alvarez,

15:00.333 --> 15:01.800
who has been missing
for three weeks,

15:01.867 --> 15:04.066
once again evaded capture.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.500
In a related story,

15:05.567 --> 15:07.900
Superior Court Judge
Mason Koessler today

15:07.967 --> 15:09.333
granted the unusual request

15:09.400 --> 15:11.800
of convicted murderer
Nathaniel Ginzburg

15:11.867 --> 15:14.000
who asked to be executed
two months earlier

15:14.066 --> 15:15.900
than the court had ordered.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.233
The execution will
take place next Thursday

15:18.300 --> 15:21.367
at the Oswald State
Correctional Facility.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.100
- Sister Pete's
here to see you.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.000
- How do I look?

15:36.967 --> 15:38.433
- You look like
Susan Hayward.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.834
- Bingo. That's what
I was going for.

15:40.900 --> 15:44.400
Sister,
I'm so grateful to you

15:44.467 --> 15:45.834
for everything you've done,

15:45.900 --> 15:48.467
but I've gotta ask
you one more favor.

15:48.533 --> 15:50.900
- Anything.

15:50.967 --> 15:52.433
- My nails.

15:52.500 --> 15:56.200
I'm so excited, can't
hold the damn brush still.

15:56.266 --> 15:57.300
Will you do me?

15:57.367 --> 15:58.400
- Sure.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.934
Sit down.
- Yeah.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.967
- Okay.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.667
Now, keep your hands still.

16:08.734 --> 16:10.934
Okay, that's it.

16:13.767 --> 16:15.400
Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

16:15.467 --> 16:17.100
- You know what?
No, no, no, no.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.266
You'd better lie down.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.700
We'll finish your
nails later, okay?

16:24.600 --> 16:26.700
5:00 a.m.

16:26.767 --> 16:29.934
I got me a date
with an angel.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.100
- You rest.

16:35.600 --> 16:37.333
- Ginzburg's dead tomorrow

16:37.400 --> 16:38.700
'cause he killed
Antonio Nappa.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.600
- Yeah?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.300
- You wanted him
to do it.

16:43.367 --> 16:44.867
- Yeah.

16:44.934 --> 16:47.133
- Doesn't that
bother you a little?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.834
He's dying 'cause of you.

16:49.900 --> 16:53.266
- No. This is
the life we chose.

16:53.333 --> 16:57.000
- Sure, but Chuckie,
are you afraid of dying?

16:58.633 --> 16:59.800
- No.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.367
- What the fuck you doing

17:02.433 --> 17:04.166
with a cigarette, Pancamo?

17:04.233 --> 17:05.834
- Smoking it?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.867
- Put it out...now,

17:08.934 --> 17:10.400
or I'm coming in there!

17:14.600 --> 17:17.934
- Now, her I'm afraid of.

17:18.000 --> 17:20.533
- I heard Ginzburg
picked the gas chamber

17:20.600 --> 17:23.266
as a way to die.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.300
- That'd be all right.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.934
One minute you're sitting there
breathing in and out,

17:28.000 --> 17:32.500
the stuff fills your lungs,
the next thing you know,

17:32.567 --> 17:34.133
you don't know nothin'.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.066
- A blow job.

17:36.133 --> 17:37.200
- What?

17:37.266 --> 17:39.800
- Instead of a last meal,

17:39.867 --> 17:43.734
they should give you
one last blow job.

17:43.800 --> 17:46.200
Yeah.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.600
- Ginzburg, it's time.

18:04.767 --> 18:07.433
Ginzburg?

18:10.100 --> 18:11.867
- Nat?

18:11.934 --> 18:13.600
Oh, my God, he's cold.

18:17.133 --> 18:19.467
He's dead.

18:19.533 --> 18:21.667
- Get a doctor.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.200
- Go figure.

18:24.266 --> 18:28.433
He dies in his sleep
of natural causes.

18:30.333 --> 18:33.000
- He looks so beautiful.

18:36.900 --> 18:38.400
- What are you doing?

18:38.467 --> 18:41.100
- I'm going to
finish his nails.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.734
- Count!

19:07.734 --> 19:09.233
- Mobay...

19:17.033 --> 19:18.433
Mobay!

19:18.500 --> 19:20.300
Get your ass
in the air!

19:43.500 --> 19:46.300
- yeah, yeah, coming.

19:58.600 --> 20:01.800
- Mobay, pay attention.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.533
- Tomorrow,
we get healthy.

20:03.600 --> 20:04.567
- Healthy?

20:04.633 --> 20:05.834
What does that mean,
healthy?

20:05.900 --> 20:08.100
- Means we getting
a new shipment in.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.233
- Where?

20:09.300 --> 20:11.300
- None of your business.

20:11.367 --> 20:13.934
So Mobay, Tidd, Browne,

20:14.000 --> 20:16.166
I want each of you to
bring me five new babies.

20:16.233 --> 20:17.533
- Babies?

20:17.600 --> 20:19.400
- Some new customers,
brother.

20:19.467 --> 20:21.166
- Babies, okay.

20:21.233 --> 20:24.633
- Poet, you supervise.

20:24.700 --> 20:26.400
- I don't need supervising.

20:31.734 --> 20:36.533
- What you need is to
learn to take an order.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.834
- Yes...sir.

20:43.166 --> 20:44.467
- Mobay!

20:44.533 --> 20:47.767
You know Detective McGorry
from Homicide?

20:47.834 --> 20:48.767
- Sure.

20:48.834 --> 20:50.900
Hi, Guinevere.
- John.

20:50.967 --> 20:52.834
- You're here about
the death of Bruno Goergen.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.500
- Goergen may have
been a bad cop,

20:54.567 --> 20:57.400
but he turned state's evidence
in the gun smuggling case.

20:57.467 --> 20:59.333
The D.A. is pissed
that his prime witness

20:59.400 --> 21:01.400
didn't last a week in OZ.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.500
- Any idea who killed him?

21:03.567 --> 21:05.400
- I thought him falling
down the elevator shaft

21:05.467 --> 21:06.533
was an accident.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.667
- Aah!

21:07.734 --> 21:10.166
- No, my gut says otherwise.

21:10.233 --> 21:12.200
- You think somebody
whacked Goergen

21:12.266 --> 21:14.033
'cause they found out
he was a cop?

21:14.100 --> 21:15.900
- No, this is something else.

21:15.967 --> 21:17.500
I just can't
figure out what yet.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.166
- Wait, Mobay,
please, man, please!

21:19.233 --> 21:21.834
- Aah!

21:21.900 --> 21:24.700
- Well, if I can help your
investigation in any way...

21:24.767 --> 21:26.233
- Yeah, well,
keep your ears open.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.800
You hear boasting,
you call me.

21:27.867 --> 21:29.700
Warden, I'm gonna
set up some interviews

21:29.767 --> 21:31.266
starting with Goergen's
cellmate.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.367
- Okay.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.900
- Later.

21:40.166 --> 21:43.700
So...you in good with
Adebisi and the boys?

21:43.767 --> 21:45.233
- Yes.

21:45.300 --> 21:47.934
They've got a fresh supply
showing up tomorrow,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.400
only I can't find out
which door.

21:49.467 --> 21:52.500
They also want me to
recruit some new buyers.

21:52.567 --> 21:55.967
- As a police officer,
you can't sell drugs.

21:56.033 --> 21:57.700
- I know.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.667
I'll use the cash I have and
pretend I found my "babies".

22:09.266 --> 22:11.600
- Hey, there's your boy.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.333
- Oh. Got him, got him.

22:16.333 --> 22:17.834
Where you been?

22:17.900 --> 22:20.266
- Recruiting.
I got two babies.

22:20.333 --> 22:23.367
- Who?
- I don't know their names.

22:23.433 --> 22:24.867
- Well, point 'em
out to me, man.

22:24.934 --> 22:28.233
- They already left.
- Shit.

22:28.300 --> 22:29.533
Well, give me
that money, man.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.266
Come on, come on,
come on...

22:31.333 --> 22:32.834
- I want the tits.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.200
- A'ight.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.533
Here you go.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.834
Keep on selling, baby.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.633
Keep oooon selling.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.200
- Hey, Mobay,
give it a rest, man.

22:49.266 --> 22:52.066
You been shoving that shit up
your nose since lights out.

22:52.133 --> 22:53.266
I wanna get some sleep.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.066
So, sleep.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.367
- What'd you say?

23:04.433 --> 23:06.433
Nothing, sorry.

23:31.834 --> 23:33.100
- Sister Peter Marie,

23:33.166 --> 23:35.000
Um...

23:35.066 --> 23:38.033
I'm glad the warden
told you who I really am.

23:38.100 --> 23:39.867
Um...

23:39.934 --> 23:43.500
I need to talk, and I need
this to be confidential.

23:43.567 --> 23:45.400
- Of course.

23:47.633 --> 23:51.100
- Oz is my first big
undercover assignment.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.233
A lot of the guys
I work with in Narcotics

23:53.300 --> 23:54.867
didn't think I could
handle the job,

23:54.934 --> 23:57.633
but I knew I could.
I thought I could.

23:59.500 --> 24:02.533
I left my wife and son.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.433
Told them I'd be gone
I don't know how many months.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.967
Abby, that's my wife,

24:07.033 --> 24:13.100
um...
she's worried, naturally,

24:13.166 --> 24:16.567
that I'll be found out,
that I'll be killed.

24:18.467 --> 24:20.767
Today's Robbie's birthday.

24:21.133 --> 24:23.567
Ohh...

24:23.633 --> 24:27.667
I thought I was close
to busting the drug ring,

24:27.734 --> 24:29.633
but...I'm not.

24:31.233 --> 24:33.734
Only I've got to.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.433
I blow this, my career's over.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.533
I'm back to riding
the subways arresting bums,

24:38.600 --> 24:41.700
so I gotta stay,
I gotta see this through.

24:41.767 --> 24:42.867
But...

24:50.166 --> 24:52.066
Sister...

24:53.967 --> 24:55.900
I-I'm an addict.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.667
- People in love sometimes say

25:04.734 --> 25:06.834
that they're head over heels,

25:06.900 --> 25:09.867
but if they knew
what the phrase really meant,

25:09.934 --> 25:12.033
I'm not sure that
they'd make the claim.

25:12.100 --> 25:14.100
Back in the bad old days,

25:14.166 --> 25:16.633
as a warning to criminals,

25:16.700 --> 25:20.567
judges would order malcontents
to be hung by their ankles,

25:20.633 --> 25:22.834
heels over head.

25:22.900 --> 25:26.133
The phrase came to mean
a state of helplessness,

25:26.200 --> 25:29.433
confusion.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.033
Now that I think of it,

25:31.100 --> 25:34.033
that is being in love.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.800
- What should I do

25:35.867 --> 25:37.667
if I ever find out
who killed Gary?

25:37.734 --> 25:40.100
- You whack him.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.834
- Yeah?

25:42.900 --> 25:45.133
That'd be my pleasure.
- What the fuck?

25:45.200 --> 25:47.900
Aah!
- You murdered my son!

26:05.000 --> 26:08.100
- My son is dead.
Nothing can change that.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.200
And Keller had Gary killed.

26:10.266 --> 26:11.834
Nothing's gonna
change that either.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.800
- Beecher, killing Keller

26:13.867 --> 26:17.467
is no way to
mourn your child.

26:17.533 --> 26:19.266
- What, now you're defending
that cocksucker?

26:19.333 --> 26:23.567
- No, he must be punished.

26:23.633 --> 26:24.734
But not by you.

26:26.900 --> 26:31.033
- Tobias, the FBI
found your daughter.

26:31.100 --> 26:32.367
Holly's alive.

26:48.700 --> 26:50.567
- We investigated
the lead you gave us.

26:50.633 --> 26:52.033
Bob "Big Butt" Toland

26:52.100 --> 26:53.700
had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.266
He'd been arrested
two days before

26:55.333 --> 26:57.367
and was sitting in the
Crown and Shield Holding Center

26:57.433 --> 26:59.333
awaiting arraignment.

26:59.400 --> 27:01.100
- But if he didn't do it,
that means...

27:01.166 --> 27:04.200
- Chris Keller is...innocent.

27:04.266 --> 27:07.600
- Oh, Christ.

27:07.667 --> 27:11.734
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

27:11.800 --> 27:13.967
- We arrested the real
kidnapper this morning.

27:14.033 --> 27:17.100
- Tobias...

27:17.166 --> 27:18.633
it's Hank Schillinger.

27:25.633 --> 27:27.467
- Sit down, Vern.

27:27.533 --> 27:30.800
We got a couple of
items to discuss.

27:32.233 --> 27:34.133
- Oh, do we now?

27:53.233 --> 27:58.266
- I got a file just full of
fights between you two.

27:58.333 --> 28:03.367
Plus, I'm told you like to
fuck each other up the ass.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.433
Now, I'm not wild
about either practice,

28:06.500 --> 28:09.600
so, Keller, I'm moving
you to another pod.

28:09.667 --> 28:11.533
But if either of
you touches the other,

28:11.600 --> 28:13.233
in love or war,

28:13.300 --> 28:16.934
I will transfer
both of you to Gen Pop.

28:17.000 --> 28:18.100
Understood?

28:18.166 --> 28:19.834
- Yes.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.100
- Yes.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.533
- Keller, go pack.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.800
Beecher, I have
other business with you.

28:29.633 --> 28:32.266
The warden tells me that
an inmate from Unit B,

28:32.333 --> 28:33.800
Vern Schillinger,

28:33.867 --> 28:36.834
may be responsible
for your son's death.

28:36.900 --> 28:38.633
So we've decided
for the time being

28:38.700 --> 28:41.467
to restrict your movements
through the rest of Oz.

28:41.533 --> 28:43.300
No library or gym privileges,

28:43.367 --> 28:46.433
and you'll eat your meals
here at Em City.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.967
- He killed my son,
and I get punished for it?

28:49.033 --> 28:52.266
- Well, given the fact
that I have transferred

28:52.333 --> 28:54.567
all the Aryans out of Em City,

28:54.633 --> 28:56.867
this is the safest
place for you.

28:56.934 --> 28:58.400
- Safe?

28:58.467 --> 29:01.667
- Relatively speaking.

29:08.767 --> 29:10.867
- Chris?
- Don't.

29:10.934 --> 29:12.200
Don't even.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.600
- My son...died horribly.

29:18.667 --> 29:20.867
I was out of my mind
with grief.

29:20.934 --> 29:22.166
- You actually thought
in your heart

29:22.233 --> 29:24.066
that I could do
such a thing?

29:24.133 --> 29:27.200
Order the murder
of a child?

29:28.333 --> 29:29.867
Your child?

29:29.934 --> 29:33.000
Yeah, you've got
plenty of reasons

29:33.066 --> 29:35.100
to assume
the worst about me.

29:35.166 --> 29:37.800
But I worked very hard...

29:40.800 --> 29:44.266
To regain your trust,
your love.

29:44.333 --> 29:46.867
I thought I had, but
this proves that I haven't.

29:46.934 --> 29:48.633
- Chris...
- I don't, I can't...

29:48.700 --> 29:50.133
- Please.
- I never will.

29:50.200 --> 29:51.500
- Please!
- No, we're over.

29:51.567 --> 29:52.900
We're finished,
we're done.

29:52.967 --> 29:55.133
- Chris,
you gotta forgive me.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.834
- No.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.233
- I forgave you.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.567
- Well, I guess that
makes you the better man.

30:09.934 --> 30:13.066
- Howdy.
I's your new neighbor.

30:22.533 --> 30:25.934
- This is my bunk.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.834
- It ain't no more.

30:28.967 --> 30:33.667
- Hey, Mondo,
play nice.

30:33.734 --> 30:36.233
- Lunch detail!

30:36.300 --> 30:37.800
- Follow me.

30:47.233 --> 30:49.467
- Feds arrested Hank?

30:49.533 --> 30:51.033
- Yeah.

30:51.100 --> 30:54.333
After letting the girl go,
the Feds surrounded him.

30:56.633 --> 30:57.700
- Push comes to shove,

30:57.767 --> 30:59.700
with the federal boys
leaning on him,

30:59.767 --> 31:02.500
think your son'll
give you up?

31:02.567 --> 31:05.633
- Honest to Christ,
I don't know.

31:08.333 --> 31:09.900
- Hey, Vern.

31:09.967 --> 31:13.233
Four marriages...
I never had any kids.

31:13.300 --> 31:16.367
So I don't know dick
about parenting, but you--fuck.

31:16.433 --> 31:19.166
You deserve
some sort of prize.

31:19.233 --> 31:21.166
One son, you give him drugs
knowing he'll O.D.

31:21.233 --> 31:23.066
The other you set up
for lethal injection.

31:23.133 --> 31:24.333
You're father
of the fucking year.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.900
But you know what
the best news is?

31:25.967 --> 31:28.000
When both your sons are dead,
that'll be the end of it,

31:28.066 --> 31:30.767
'cause you ain't making
any more children--not in here.

31:30.834 --> 31:33.767
So that when you die,
your name dies with you.

31:33.834 --> 31:36.500
Everything you are
dies when you do.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.800
And the world'll
be a better place.

31:49.600 --> 31:52.467
- Well, well, well.
What have we got up in here?

31:52.533 --> 31:55.700
Oh, I see, my man, Keller.
What's up, dog?

31:55.767 --> 31:57.767
Hey, Keller, man, I gotta
ask you a question, man.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.900
You mind if I fuck your
girlfriend Beecher?

31:59.967 --> 32:01.934
You mind
if she sucks my cock?

32:03.633 --> 32:06.433
- I don't give a fuck
what you do or what he does.

32:06.500 --> 32:07.900
- You heard that, Leroy?

32:07.967 --> 32:09.600
- I did, Mondo, I did.

32:09.667 --> 32:11.734
- All right, 'cause we don't
want no problems in Em City,

32:11.800 --> 32:15.467
so it goes on record
that I got Keller's permission

32:15.533 --> 32:17.233
to fuck Beecher up the yazoo.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.600
- Yes, you do.

32:25.300 --> 32:26.633
- Peace.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.667
- What happened
to your hand?

32:55.133 --> 32:58.000
- I was remembering
what hell felt like.

32:59.767 --> 33:02.500
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

33:02.567 --> 33:03.900
In the past year or so,

33:03.967 --> 33:06.400
I've committed numerous
homosexual acts.

33:08.533 --> 33:09.700
Do you want me to elaborate?

33:09.767 --> 33:11.467
- No.

33:11.533 --> 33:16.333
- Before coming to Oz,
I had sex with several men...

33:23.033 --> 33:25.600
And then I whacked them.

33:25.667 --> 33:27.934
- What?

33:28.000 --> 33:31.900
- After sex,
I murdered them.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.567
- Why?

33:36.533 --> 33:38.000
- I didn't want 'em to tell.

33:38.066 --> 33:40.300
I didn't want 'em
to speak my name.

33:40.367 --> 33:44.700
- You have to go to
the authorities and confess.

33:44.767 --> 33:46.333
- What?

33:49.500 --> 33:50.867
You can't absolve me?

33:50.934 --> 33:52.967
- I can absolve you,
but the only way to show God

33:53.033 --> 33:55.467
that you're truly sorry
is to go to the police.

33:59.500 --> 34:01.000
- Look...

34:03.567 --> 34:05.500
I'm truly sorry, okay?

34:05.567 --> 34:07.600
So just fucking absolve me.

34:09.934 --> 34:11.033
- No.

34:17.433 --> 34:20.467
Give me my fucking penance.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.166
- No.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.433
- God damn you.

34:32.500 --> 34:34.433
God damn you to
fucking hell,

34:34.500 --> 34:36.633
you Goddamn hack in black.

34:44.066 --> 34:46.066
-  Oh, no.

34:59.767 --> 35:02.700
- Come on, Beecher,
suck my dick.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.567
- Jesus,
you're such a romantic.

35:05.633 --> 35:07.934
That the way you
talk to your women?

35:08.000 --> 35:13.233
- Well, when I'm horny,
the less talk, the better.

35:16.834 --> 35:19.066
- Okay, lover boy.

35:22.333 --> 35:24.000
Pucker up.

35:40.300 --> 35:44.834
- For centuries, part of any
punishment was humiliation.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.333
In England,
they'd hang a criminal

35:47.400 --> 35:49.734
inside a cage
a few feet off the ground

35:49.800 --> 35:52.200
in the middle
of the town square.

35:52.266 --> 35:56.533
The guilty fuck sat in his cage
looking like a canary,

35:56.600 --> 35:58.567
like a parakeet,

35:58.633 --> 36:02.767
so people started
calling them jailbirds.

36:02.834 --> 36:06.233
Only the kind of
chirping we do in Oz

36:06.300 --> 36:07.467
ain't all that pretty.

36:09.033 --> 36:12.200
- Ahh!

36:22.800 --> 36:24.000
- Ahhhhhh....

36:27.533 --> 36:29.300
Ahhhh....

36:35.000 --> 36:37.900
- Mr. Morales.
- Mr. Rebadow.

36:37.967 --> 36:40.000
- My request.

36:40.066 --> 36:41.967
You said you needed time
to think it over.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.433
- Ah, yes.

36:43.500 --> 36:45.767
- Well?

36:45.834 --> 36:48.133
- When you asked me
to kill Raoul Hernandez,

36:48.200 --> 36:51.633
you said I could have
anything I wanted in return.

36:56.734 --> 36:59.233
- And now you want me to
let you kill someone else?

36:59.300 --> 37:00.600
- Yes.

37:04.233 --> 37:06.900
Oddly enough, there's no one
I need exterminated

37:06.967 --> 37:08.467
at the present time.

37:08.533 --> 37:11.333
Besides, as a newly
appointed trustee,

37:11.400 --> 37:13.133
I have promised Querns

37:13.200 --> 37:16.133
that there will be
no violence in Emerald City.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.767
- You're going
against your word.

37:18.834 --> 37:20.633
- Ask for something else.

37:20.700 --> 37:22.934
Cigarettes, money, drugs.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.934
- I want to kill somebody.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.900
- If you have your
heart set on it,

37:26.967 --> 37:28.600
why do you need
my permission?

37:28.667 --> 37:30.800
- Not permission, protection.

37:30.867 --> 37:32.266
- That you can have.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.567
- No matter who I kill?

37:37.600 --> 37:41.467
- You aren't gonna do
anything crazy, are you?

37:41.533 --> 37:42.533
Like waste Pancamo?

37:42.600 --> 37:44.667
- Certainly not.

37:44.734 --> 37:47.266
- Then who are
you gonna kill?

37:47.333 --> 37:49.633
- Who, indeed?

38:33.600 --> 38:35.200
May I join you?

38:35.266 --> 38:38.100
May I join you,
Busmalis?

38:38.166 --> 38:40.033
- You're talking to me?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.700
You're actually saying words
intended for my ears?

38:42.767 --> 38:45.066
- Yes.

38:45.133 --> 38:47.934
I've been treating you badly,
and I'm sorry.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.533
- You mean all's forgiven?

38:49.600 --> 38:53.734
- That's right,
all's forgiven.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.700
Would you like my pie?

38:55.767 --> 38:59.533
- Yes!
Yes!

39:05.834 --> 39:08.367
- I'm tired but happy.

39:08.433 --> 39:11.100
You're speaking to me again.

39:11.166 --> 39:14.166
The chicken
at dinner was edible.

39:14.233 --> 39:17.867
All in all, life is good.

39:17.934 --> 39:19.867
I'm the happiest of men.

39:21.100 --> 39:22.433
- Lights out!

39:24.800 --> 39:27.767
- I've been reading
"The Art of War" by Sun-Tzu.

39:30.100 --> 39:31.500
Fascinating stuff.

39:31.567 --> 39:34.633
The instinct to kill
is as common

39:34.700 --> 39:38.000
as the need to procreate.

39:38.066 --> 39:42.567
Those of us in Oz are
actually the normal ones,

39:42.633 --> 39:45.100
following nature's lead.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.033
Funny, huh, Busmalis?

39:52.567 --> 39:54.967
Busmalis?

40:30.667 --> 40:33.734
- Aah! Aah!
Jesus, Bob!

40:33.800 --> 40:35.667
Help!
What are you doing?

40:35.734 --> 40:37.533
Get him off me! Help!

40:37.600 --> 40:38.934
He's trying to kill me!

40:39.000 --> 40:41.066
Jesus Christ, he cut me!

40:44.867 --> 40:47.100
What the fuck
did he do that for?!

40:47.166 --> 40:48.900
God damn it...
- It's okay!

40:48.967 --> 40:50.934
- I'm all cut up here!

41:27.567 --> 41:31.200
- Eddie, hey, yeah,
no, it's me.

41:31.266 --> 41:33.033
That's why I'm calling.

41:33.100 --> 41:35.000
Yeah, right.

41:35.066 --> 41:36.433
You'll get it
done by next week?

41:36.500 --> 41:37.700
Good.

41:37.767 --> 41:39.433
No later than
next week, right?

41:39.500 --> 41:42.333
Okay, all right, see ya.

41:57.700 --> 41:59.667
- You called for me?

41:59.734 --> 42:01.433
- Did you put
Hoyt into Solitary?

42:01.500 --> 42:02.867
- No.

42:02.934 --> 42:04.934
- He tried to kill me.
- I know.

42:05.000 --> 42:07.900
But so far neither
of you will tell me why.

42:07.967 --> 42:09.900
- It's personal.

42:09.967 --> 42:11.934
- Fine.

42:12.000 --> 42:13.567
You asked for
protective custody,

42:13.633 --> 42:14.900
I set you up here.

42:14.967 --> 42:17.100
But sooner or later,
I'm bringing you back,

42:17.166 --> 42:19.166
and Hoyt or one
of his biker buddies

42:19.233 --> 42:20.567
will finish the job on you.

42:20.633 --> 42:24.066
So go ahead...
keep it personal.

42:25.400 --> 42:26.900
- Wait!

42:32.367 --> 42:35.633
I will tell you...

42:35.700 --> 42:36.767
everything.

42:38.633 --> 42:41.266
Gulino had the cell phone.

42:41.333 --> 42:43.834
After he died,
I got hold of it.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.066
Now O'Reilly's got it.

42:46.133 --> 42:48.266
He's hidden it
somewhere in Em City.

42:56.433 --> 42:58.834
- Where is it?

42:58.900 --> 43:00.133
The cell phone.

43:00.200 --> 43:01.633
- What cell phone,
Mr. Querns?

43:01.700 --> 43:03.000
- You know
which cell phone.

43:03.066 --> 43:05.000
- They're against
the rules, sir.

43:08.033 --> 43:09.133
- Mm-hmm.

43:11.834 --> 43:13.033
- You didn't find it?

43:13.100 --> 43:15.467
- No, and without
that cell phone,

43:15.533 --> 43:17.800
I have no way of proving
your story is true.

43:17.867 --> 43:19.166
- So what happens now?

43:19.233 --> 43:22.333
- Well, I leave you here
a couple more days,

43:22.400 --> 43:24.767
then I'm sending you back.

43:24.834 --> 43:26.200
- To die.

43:28.333 --> 43:32.767
All right, Mr. Querns,
I have two requests.

43:32.834 --> 43:35.900
I would like to see
my girlfriend

43:35.967 --> 43:38.266
and a rabbi.

43:38.333 --> 43:39.934
- I'll set it up.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.867
- I am soon very
likely going to die.

43:46.934 --> 43:48.233
- Nikolai.

43:48.300 --> 43:49.567
- There is one thing
you must do for me.

43:49.633 --> 43:50.633
- Anything.

43:51.934 --> 43:53.667
- Tonight at 5:00 p.m.,

43:53.734 --> 43:57.233
I want you to dial
this phone number.

43:58.633 --> 44:01.266
It must be 5:00 p.m. sharp.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.800
- In my proudest moment
as your governor,

44:11.867 --> 44:14.967
I signed the law that
reinstated the death penalty.

44:15.033 --> 44:16.834
Together,
we've made great strides

44:16.900 --> 44:19.867
in the war on crime,
but there's much more to do.

44:19.934 --> 44:21.834
Let's finish the job.

44:21.900 --> 44:24.934
- The courage to lead.
James Devlin, Governor.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.867
- A long time ago,

44:27.934 --> 44:31.700
if a man stole another man's
cow or lamb or pig

44:31.767 --> 44:34.000
and butchered it

44:34.066 --> 44:37.967
and was found with the animal's
blood on his fingers,

44:38.033 --> 44:42.867
he was Said to be caught
"red-handed".

44:42.934 --> 44:46.300
Of course, if the robber
was too cocky to wash his hands,

44:46.367 --> 44:48.600
maybe he deserved
to get busted.

44:50.700 --> 44:52.567
- Count!

45:01.133 --> 45:03.266
- Fuck that.
- Yeah.

45:13.200 --> 45:14.867
- Shit.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.867
Fuck.

45:41.667 --> 45:43.467
- I never touched
the cell phone.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.266
- He never
let me touch it.

45:45.333 --> 45:47.066
- I didn't kill Gulino.

45:47.133 --> 45:48.333
- Stanislofsky did.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.667
- It's his word against mine.

45:49.734 --> 45:52.333
- I got five guys
that'll back me up.

45:54.734 --> 45:57.066
- I want Stanislofsky dead.

45:57.133 --> 46:00.266
- Protective custody?
No can do.

46:00.333 --> 46:02.033
- I thought you had some clout
in this fucking place.

46:02.100 --> 46:04.000
- Sorry, O'Reilly.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.867
Your brother,
he sleep all day?

46:08.934 --> 46:11.700
- No, they just got him
on this new medication

46:11.767 --> 46:13.467
to calm him down and stuff.

46:13.533 --> 46:17.667
-  You ask me,
he's, uh, too calm.

46:26.633 --> 46:29.266
- Cyril, psst!

46:29.333 --> 46:32.700
Cyril?

46:32.767 --> 46:34.467
Cyril, wake up.

46:34.533 --> 46:35.834
Cyril!

46:35.900 --> 46:37.000
Cyril, wake up!

46:37.066 --> 46:38.400
Cyril, wake the fuck up!

46:38.467 --> 46:40.700
Cyril...fuck!

46:40.767 --> 46:42.133
Officer Smith,

46:42.200 --> 46:44.033
there's something
the matter with my brother.

46:44.100 --> 46:45.433
- What do you mean?
- I don't know!

46:45.500 --> 46:46.600
Hurry up,
call a fucking doctor!

46:46.667 --> 46:48.867
Let's go!
- Central, this is 16.

46:48.934 --> 46:50.467
We got a possible
O.D. here.

46:54.333 --> 46:55.834
- BP's 80 over 60.

46:55.900 --> 46:58.066
- Let's start two large IVs
with normal saline

46:58.133 --> 46:59.200
running wide open.

46:59.266 --> 47:00.500
We'll need to tube him.

47:00.567 --> 47:03.266
- What happened?
- He ODed on the Haldol.

47:10.300 --> 47:12.233
- O'Reilly?
- What?

47:12.300 --> 47:13.567
- Any news on your brother?

47:13.633 --> 47:17.166
- No. The fucking hacks,
they tell me to wait here

47:17.233 --> 47:19.467
and I'm fucking waiting here,
and there's nothing.

47:19.533 --> 47:21.266
What's going on in there?

47:21.333 --> 47:23.166
- I'm sure he'll be fine.

47:23.233 --> 47:26.033
- You know, she did this.
This fucking Dr. Nathan.

47:26.100 --> 47:28.133
She gives him too much
of the drugs on purpose.

47:28.200 --> 47:30.133
It's her way of trying
to get back at me.

47:30.200 --> 47:31.767
- I don't think she's capable of
something like that.

47:31.834 --> 47:33.033
- Hey, Gloria
fucking hates me.

47:33.100 --> 47:34.734
Wake up.
I mean, she thinks

47:34.800 --> 47:36.200
I hired Keenan to rape her.

47:36.266 --> 47:38.266
Now she's got my brother
back there in her clutches

47:38.333 --> 47:40.633
and there's not a fucking
thing I can do about it.

47:40.700 --> 47:42.500
I fucking
hate this place!

47:42.567 --> 47:44.467
Fuck!
Cyril!

47:45.500 --> 47:48.000
- Gloria, how's Cyril?

47:48.066 --> 47:49.400
- Well, they pumped
his stomach.

47:49.467 --> 47:50.834
He's breathing normally.

47:50.900 --> 47:53.033
Problem is, we don't know
how long he was unconscious

47:53.100 --> 47:54.367
before they
brought him in,

47:54.433 --> 47:56.333
so the next few hours
will be dicey.

47:56.400 --> 47:58.033
But I think he'll be fine.

47:58.100 --> 48:00.734
- How does that
make you feel?

48:00.800 --> 48:02.367
- Are we suddenly
in session?

48:02.433 --> 48:04.900
- No, no, I just
want to be sure

48:04.967 --> 48:07.000
that he gets the best
care that he can.

48:07.066 --> 48:09.467
- Oh, and you don't think
that I'm capable

48:09.533 --> 48:11.166
of separating my
professional obligations

48:11.233 --> 48:12.700
from my anger?

48:12.767 --> 48:14.934
- I think that right now,
you're so turned around,

48:15.000 --> 48:16.934
you can't see
which way to go.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.233
- I have other patients--

48:18.300 --> 48:19.700
- Gloria, Gloria.

48:19.767 --> 48:22.834
Ryan O'Reilly did not
hire that man to rape you.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.600
- He admitted that he did.

48:24.667 --> 48:28.200
- He told you what
you wanted to hear.

48:28.266 --> 48:31.266
- Keenan raped me
because of O'Reilly.

48:31.333 --> 48:33.266
- The attack on you
was random.

48:33.333 --> 48:35.133
If Keenan hadn't
raped you,

48:35.200 --> 48:37.900
he would've
raped someone else.

48:47.867 --> 48:49.200
- Hey, Keenan.

48:49.266 --> 48:50.533
- Hey.

48:50.600 --> 48:53.000
- Hey, luck of
the Irish, right?

48:53.066 --> 48:54.834
- Uhh...
- All right.

48:54.900 --> 49:00.633
Hey, I, uh, want you
to do something for me.

49:00.700 --> 49:02.000
- Anything.

49:02.066 --> 49:04.033
- I want you to tell me.

49:04.100 --> 49:05.867
- About what?

49:05.934 --> 49:08.400
- When you raped
Dr. Nathan,

49:08.467 --> 49:10.934
I want to know what
it was like to fuck her.

49:13.967 --> 49:15.467
- Okay.

49:17.266 --> 49:19.667
She was headed
into her apartment.

49:19.734 --> 49:22.000
Looking so hot.

49:22.066 --> 49:23.100
- Yeah.

49:25.300 --> 49:27.100
- How you feeling?

49:27.166 --> 49:28.934
- My head hurts.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.033
- That'll go away.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.033
- Where's Ryan?

49:33.100 --> 49:35.700
- I don't know,
probably Em City.

49:35.767 --> 49:38.367
- And then I just
slammed my cock into her.

49:38.433 --> 49:40.066
I slammed her.

49:40.133 --> 49:42.500
- You don't like us,
do you?

49:42.567 --> 49:45.133
I like you.

49:45.200 --> 49:47.100
- Until she couldn't
scream no more.

49:47.166 --> 49:49.266
Couldn't
breathe no more.

49:49.333 --> 49:53.467
- My brother...

49:53.533 --> 49:56.266
he does bad things,

49:56.333 --> 49:58.600
but deep down
he's not bad.

50:00.233 --> 50:03.900
- I came inside her,
and she was moaning.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.934
Ohh...

50:06.000 --> 50:10.266
- He loves you...

50:10.333 --> 50:12.433
with all his heart.

50:17.233 --> 50:21.266
- Jesus, you sure did
a job on her, huh?

50:21.333 --> 50:22.667
- Oh, yeah.

50:22.734 --> 50:24.834
- Yeah.

50:24.900 --> 50:28.967
So...you say you wanna
work for me?

50:29.033 --> 50:30.467
- Definitely.

50:30.533 --> 50:32.600
- I do things
different here in Oz

50:32.667 --> 50:34.467
than the way
we worked on the street.

50:34.533 --> 50:38.300
For instance,
when I want someone dead,

50:38.367 --> 50:40.400
I never grease 'em
myself.

50:40.467 --> 50:44.700
I always talk someone else
into doing the deed for me.

50:44.767 --> 50:46.867
I make them believe
the person I want dead

50:46.934 --> 50:48.533
is their enemy.

50:48.600 --> 50:50.900
That way the kill
can't be traced back to me.

50:50.967 --> 50:52.500
- That's so cool.

50:52.567 --> 50:54.400
- You got, what,
seven years till parole?

50:54.467 --> 50:55.667
- Uh-huh.

50:55.734 --> 50:57.033
- You think
you'll go the distance?

50:57.100 --> 50:58.300
- Sure, I'll get out.

50:58.367 --> 51:00.834
- Yeah, that's good.

51:00.900 --> 51:02.533
You keep believing
that, Patrick.

51:02.600 --> 51:04.300
You know how I said

51:04.367 --> 51:05.900
I always get someone
to kill for me?

51:05.967 --> 51:07.266
- Yeah.

51:07.333 --> 51:10.934
- Well...

51:11.000 --> 51:12.867
in your case,

51:12.934 --> 51:14.867
I'm gonna make an exception.

51:14.934 --> 51:16.600
Aah!

51:46.133 --> 51:48.000
- Take him down
to the morgue.

52:18.133 --> 52:20.567
My only real memory
from that night

52:20.633 --> 52:23.600
was this shamrock.

52:23.667 --> 52:25.767
I remember the light
from the street lamp

52:25.834 --> 52:27.433
kept bouncing off it.

52:30.700 --> 52:32.667
When they brought
Keenan into the E.R.,

52:32.734 --> 52:35.700
I thought...

52:35.767 --> 52:38.967
"Good.

52:39.033 --> 52:40.867
He's dead. Good."

52:43.667 --> 52:45.367
You were right.

52:46.900 --> 52:49.033
I came back too soon.

52:50.900 --> 52:55.200
I need to take
some time, you know.

52:55.266 --> 52:59.734
Just put my anger back
in its proper place.

53:01.600 --> 53:06.100
Maybe then I can
learn to forgive...

53:06.166 --> 53:08.500
myself more than anyone.

53:14.667 --> 53:18.333
- The job will be here whenever
you decide to come back.

53:21.500 --> 53:24.333
- If I come back, Leo.

53:25.834 --> 53:28.133
- To seal one's fate.

53:28.200 --> 53:30.633
Years ago,
the death sentence

53:30.700 --> 53:33.567
could not be carried out
unless the death warrant

53:33.633 --> 53:37.700
had the judge's official
seal affixed to the bottom.

53:37.767 --> 53:43.000
Imagine...the only thing
standing between you and death

53:43.066 --> 53:46.600
is a little lump
of melted wax.

53:50.800 --> 53:54.166
But that's
the thing about life.

53:54.233 --> 53:55.567
The big changes all come

53:55.633 --> 53:57.667
because of
little lumps of wax.
