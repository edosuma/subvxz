ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:48.423 --> 00:49.507
YEAR 1978

00:49.591 --> 00:53.887
<i>That place was much more terrible
than you think it was.</i>

00:56.890 --> 00:57.891
<i>It wasn't</i>

00:58.641 --> 01:00.769
<i>our decision to go live there.</i>

01:04.355 --> 01:05.607
<i>That's why</i>

01:06.608 --> 01:08.943
<i>those people were not going to stop.</i>

01:10.070 --> 01:15.658
<i>They starved us, abused us,
and locked us in a cold room.</i>

01:16.659 --> 01:19.579
<i>They were probably waiting
for us to die from the cold.</i>

01:22.373 --> 01:23.666
<i>I knew that.</i>

01:25.251 --> 01:27.587
<i>That’s why I had no choice but to do that.</i>

01:30.006 --> 01:31.007
<i>I knew</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:35.345
<i>it was going to end like that.</i>

01:37.388 --> 01:39.724
<i>So you just have to do as I say.</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:43.353
<i>Just follow what I tell you.</i>

02:01.746 --> 02:03.832
YEAR 1999

02:14.759 --> 02:16.010
Who are you?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.268
Hey, don't you think
your cult is going too far?

02:23.351 --> 02:25.019
This is a residential neighborhood.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.856
I don't want to create a scene,
so beat it.

02:29.315 --> 02:30.441
Excuse me.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.909
Hello, Detective Choi.

02:49.794 --> 02:53.006
Sorry for coming
without calling you first.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.385
That's all right. No worries.

02:57.969 --> 02:59.095
Thank you.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.351
How have you been lately?

03:06.019 --> 03:08.938
I don't know. It's hard to answer that.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.734
I don't know
how I've been holding up these days.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.304
Actually…

03:44.265 --> 03:45.934
I went to see him.

03:47.435 --> 03:48.353
Jo Kyung-ho.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.274
I'm certain he's involved
with the kidnapping of Jae-young.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.443
It became clear after I met him.

03:56.152 --> 03:58.655
So I've been searching for Jae-young.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.407
I'm going to follow
every possible lead to find her.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.159
Detective Choi,

04:04.535 --> 04:06.996
do you believe that Jae-young is dead?

04:07.622 --> 04:08.873
I don't have

04:10.708 --> 04:12.460
anything to say about that.

04:15.713 --> 04:17.590
I don't think she's dead, Detective Choi.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.426
I met her.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.596
Her face was covered in a veil,
but I could tell it was her.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.390
She was standing a few feet away from me.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.058
You met Jae-young?

04:27.725 --> 04:28.935
You did?

04:30.853 --> 04:32.021
Is that a fact?

04:33.314 --> 04:35.566
It was a remote building
hidden in the mountains.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.360
When I went back to the place,

04:37.443 --> 04:39.779
-A building in the mountains…
-it was shuttered.

04:39.862 --> 04:41.864
And Jae-young was nowhere to be found.

04:41.948 --> 04:43.032
When was this?

04:43.700 --> 04:46.244
Do you remember the location?

04:51.040 --> 04:52.500
So you don't want to tell me.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.544
I'm sorry.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.504
I'm determined

04:57.255 --> 04:59.007
to find her by myself.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.842
Do you think

05:01.718 --> 05:05.221
getting the police involved
will pose a threat to Jae-young's safety?

05:05.805 --> 05:07.473
When I met Jae-young there,

05:08.766 --> 05:10.351
I felt like

05:11.602 --> 05:14.272
she had chosen to be with them.

05:15.523 --> 05:17.608
If that's the case, I want to know why.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.027
I'm going to find the truth

05:20.153 --> 05:21.321
while I search for her.

05:21.404 --> 05:23.573
I'm not quite following.

05:24.657 --> 05:28.453
Why are you even telling me these things?

05:31.539 --> 05:33.458
I feel like my life could be in danger

05:34.709 --> 05:37.045
while I search for Jae-young.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.173
If something bad were to happen,

05:40.923 --> 05:42.633
I would like you to at least know

05:44.218 --> 05:45.928
that Jae-young is alive.

05:47.764 --> 05:48.848
That's the reason…

05:50.433 --> 05:51.601
why I came.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.901
You don't have to see me out.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.819
I'll give you a ride home.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.362
I'm really fine.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.531
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.078
Well…

06:12.830 --> 06:14.332
If you need to see him

06:15.750 --> 06:18.002
because of the ongoing
police investigation,

06:18.086 --> 06:21.380
I strongly urge you not to meet him.

06:22.381 --> 06:25.301
He's much more dangerous
than you think he is.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.974
You mean, Jo Kyung-ho?

06:33.684 --> 06:36.354
Yes. I hate saying that name.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.314
That's not his real name.

06:39.273 --> 06:40.817
After our dad passed,

06:41.609 --> 06:43.945
he said he'd take the same name.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.905
So he had his name changed.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.532
I always hated

06:49.534 --> 06:50.993
calling him by that name.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.746
He changed his name to his father's?

06:53.830 --> 06:54.997
Yes.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.167
Jo Kyung-ho

06:59.585 --> 07:01.087
is my late dad's name.

07:03.214 --> 07:04.674
I didn't know that.

07:07.468 --> 07:10.430
It's not something that people
are interested in knowing about.

07:11.013 --> 07:13.433
I'll get going now. Bye.

07:13.516 --> 07:15.017
I presume I'll see you

07:15.643 --> 07:17.979
at the memorial ceremony
for Shi-jung and his wife.

07:18.646 --> 07:19.981
I'll see you then.

07:21.482 --> 07:23.401
-What memorial ceremony?
-Well…

07:24.152 --> 07:27.572
You said Shi-jung's wife, Choi Kyung-joo,
was a high school friend of yours.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.083
I see you didn't know

07:41.085 --> 07:42.795
what happened to them.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.629
Hey, hold up.

08:25.171 --> 08:26.756
I think she fell because of us.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.635
Excuse me. Are you okay?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.970
-Why did you bump into her?
-Aunt!

08:38.017 --> 08:40.061
MISSING PERSON: JO JAE-YOUNG

08:44.815 --> 08:46.234
We're sorry.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.778
We've been posting these posters
and we heard that

08:48.861 --> 08:51.030
someone's been after us because of this.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.366
That's why we were running
after posting one.

08:53.449 --> 08:54.867
See, I told you so.

08:55.409 --> 09:00.289
The poster we put up here fell off
after it got soaked in the rain.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.084
Okay, I heard you.
How many times have you said that?

09:04.669 --> 09:06.879
So we coated the posters this time.

09:07.672 --> 09:08.798
Isn't it better, Aunt?

09:11.050 --> 09:14.387
MISSING PERSON: JO JAE-YOUNG

09:17.431 --> 09:21.727
We used a different photo
instead of the one you gave us.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.563
Jae-young looks

09:24.605 --> 09:26.524
a whole lot better in this one.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.821
Thanks. Jae-young looks so pretty.

09:31.904 --> 09:32.947
Don't you think so?

09:33.030 --> 09:35.491
You should have blurred your faces though.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.076
See, I told you so.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.079
We knew that would have been better.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.332
But we didn't want to blur out our faces.

09:44.542 --> 09:45.710
Why not?

09:45.793 --> 09:48.629
When we blurred our faces in the photo,

09:49.463 --> 09:51.299
Jae-young looked lonely in the picture.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.176
That's why we didn't do it.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.800
<i>Yes, it's me.
Why weren't you answering your phone?</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:37.595
I just got home after going somewhere.

10:38.220 --> 10:39.597
Is there something urgent?

10:39.680 --> 10:41.057
<i>He agreed to do the interview.</i>

10:43.059 --> 10:44.935
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

10:45.019 --> 10:46.270
<i>He said he'd do it.</i>

10:46.812 --> 10:48.064
Yes, I'm here.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.775
<i>You just have to coordinate the schedule.</i>

10:51.442 --> 10:55.696
<i>You'll finally get to meet
the infamous terrorist, Jo Kyung-ho.</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:05.498
Hey, let's take a short break.
You'll catch a cold.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.499
Okay, Aunt.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.959
We posted a poster over there too.

11:11.462 --> 11:14.090
Hey, do we need to post another one here?

11:14.173 --> 11:15.841
-It's shielded from the rain.
-You're right.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.718
Yes! We saved some.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.805
Did you bring anything?

11:23.557 --> 11:25.267
JUST DIE

11:25.351 --> 11:26.644
Can you give me some more?

11:30.106 --> 11:31.482
I just want the broth.

11:33.067 --> 11:35.569
It's still steaming hot.

11:39.865 --> 11:40.908
Aunt.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.120
Here, have some.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.585
JUST DIE

11:52.920 --> 11:53.921
What is this?

11:55.673 --> 11:58.300
How could someone write that?
People are horrible.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.808
Aunt.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.114
If you forgive men their trespasses,

12:21.115 --> 12:24.869
your heavenly Father
will also forgive you.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.967
Everyone, please be quiet.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.678
I shall continue.

12:44.388 --> 12:48.517
But if you don’t forgive men
their trespasses…

12:49.435 --> 12:51.103
Do you know what I'm holding?

12:51.979 --> 12:53.105
This is one of the rocks

12:53.189 --> 12:56.150
that was thrown
through the window of my mom's restaurant.

12:56.233 --> 12:59.987
This rock was thrown
at my mother with deadly intent.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.239
She's a person who decided to lead

13:02.323 --> 13:05.868
a quiet life running a restaurant.
She's sorry for the victims.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.038
Why does she have to be treated like this?

13:09.121 --> 13:12.124
Is it okay to do this
to the family members of a terrorist?

13:12.791 --> 13:14.126
Is it fair

13:15.002 --> 13:16.545
to despise and scorn

13:16.629 --> 13:18.464
my niece, Jae-young?

13:18.547 --> 13:19.965
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun!

13:20.049 --> 13:21.300
I understand your pain.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.887
But why did you come to
our congregation to say that?

13:26.430 --> 13:27.848
I agree, Father.

13:30.601 --> 13:33.854
This isn't the only place in town
where you can find a rock like this.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.940
Such a round, black rock.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.650
But I've only spotted

13:38.234 --> 13:41.529
this kind of rock
in the parking lot of this church.

13:41.612 --> 13:46.659
I truly want to believe
that it's just a coincidence.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.161
So I'd like to ask you all.

13:49.245 --> 13:52.331
You all believe that Jae-young,
my mother, and I

13:52.414 --> 13:54.500
have not committed any sin, right?

13:54.583 --> 13:56.794
And you all pray that Jae-young

13:57.419 --> 14:00.005
will return home safely, don't you?

14:04.093 --> 14:07.680
Let me speak for all of us, if I may.

14:08.514 --> 14:10.432
I agree with what you said, Ms. Jo.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.935
But many members of my congregation

14:13.018 --> 14:16.397
have lost a loved one due to your brother.

14:17.731 --> 14:22.152
So do not test the limits
of their patience.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.362
Do not accuse them

14:24.196 --> 14:26.490
of committing such an act.

14:26.574 --> 14:28.617
Don't hurl fabrications at them

14:28.701 --> 14:31.328
that will further deepen
their hatred towards your family.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.998
I implore you.

14:34.081 --> 14:35.249
Please

14:36.250 --> 14:37.751
leave this town.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.630
That will be the best for everyone.

14:48.846 --> 14:49.930
No.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.478
No. Father. What you said is wrong.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.232
Not my entire family.

15:00.858 --> 15:04.612
The person you should direct your hate ti
is Jo Kyung-ho and me.

15:05.237 --> 15:06.488
Just the two of us.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.866
So hate me if you want.

15:10.034 --> 15:14.663
Go ahead and curse me and say vile things.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.625
If you could for even a brief moment,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.047
pray for Jae-young.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.467
Please pray for her.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.929
Pray for her safe return

15:31.722 --> 15:34.308
so that she can go back to school

15:35.726 --> 15:37.436
and see her friends.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.522
That's all…

15:43.901 --> 15:45.778
I wanted to say to you today.

16:20.437 --> 16:22.272
Mom, I'm home.

16:48.132 --> 16:49.383
Is it…

16:54.304 --> 16:55.431
Jae-young.

16:57.224 --> 16:58.600
There you go again.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.520
Is that all you ever have to say?

17:03.731 --> 17:04.815
Kyung-joo?

17:04.898 --> 17:05.941
Jung-hyun.

17:06.775 --> 17:07.943
You know what?

17:09.820 --> 17:12.114
I had a good marriage.

17:14.074 --> 17:16.243
Although we weren't living comfortably,

17:17.369 --> 17:20.372
my husband and I were very happy together.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.584
Are you Kyung-joo?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.134
Why?

17:34.720 --> 17:36.055
Why did it have to be us?

17:41.101 --> 17:42.811
Why did it have to be me?

17:44.605 --> 17:45.898
Because we were your friend?

17:48.817 --> 17:50.652
Kyung-joo. I'm really…

17:52.696 --> 17:55.449
I didn't want anything in life.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.118
I just wanted to live happily

17:58.869 --> 18:01.038
with my husband. That was all.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.165
I didn't need anything else.

18:03.248 --> 18:04.416
Kyung-joo…

18:05.167 --> 18:06.710
I didn't want to die.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.003
I'm sorry.

18:08.754 --> 18:09.963
I'm sorry, Kyung-joo…

18:10.589 --> 18:11.673
No.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.967
It's too late.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.436
What happened to us

18:25.229 --> 18:27.272
shouldn't happen to other people.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.532
MYSTERY MAP: VACATION HOME
AMONG THE SEVEN SECRET SPOTS

19:23.370 --> 19:24.746
I'm sorry. But…

19:26.248 --> 19:28.834
What? What are you sorry about?

19:29.543 --> 19:33.088
Well, I told the boss
I would go by myself.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.466
But he brought me along
because we have to collect a debt.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.760
I'm sorry for bothering you two.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.512
I can't take hints well sometimes.

19:40.596 --> 19:43.432
Hey, why are you saying unnecessary stuff?

19:43.515 --> 19:45.684
Oh, I really appreciate your help.

19:45.767 --> 19:48.103
Both of you are helping me
despite being busy.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.898
That's really kind of you to say that.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.692
After we do the job, you can drop me off.

19:53.775 --> 19:55.402
Have dinner together.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.655
There's a terrific grilled eel restaurant
near Namgang Bridge.

19:58.739 --> 20:02.201
The boss can grill eel
really well, you know.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.285
Pig.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.120
Yes, Boss.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.082
What do you think I'll do
if you keep on talking?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.877
I think you'll grab my mouth again.

20:11.960 --> 20:14.046
Let's try to be quiet, okay?

20:14.129 --> 20:15.297
All right. Get some rest.

20:20.177 --> 20:21.553
Are you feeling all right?

20:22.179 --> 20:24.014
Yes. I'm fine, Yong-tak.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.328
This is it, right?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.665
It's exactly how it looks in the picture.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.667
I don't think anyone lives here anymore.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.013
Anyone home?

21:10.102 --> 21:12.521
It seems like the doorbell is broken.
I don't hear anything.

21:14.147 --> 21:15.315
What is this place?

21:17.442 --> 21:18.485
Beats me.

21:20.195 --> 21:23.865
-I don't remember ever coming here before.
-It's my first time here too.

21:24.825 --> 21:27.244
Boss, the door is open.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.178
You know the brother
who lives in Samcheonggol?

21:45.262 --> 21:48.140
The place where he lives
looks just like this place.

21:50.225 --> 21:52.644
Is it okay for us to come inside?

21:53.895 --> 21:55.605
This place looks like a battlefield.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.358
It seems like
they cut off the electricity.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.446
It looks abandoned to me. Let's leave
after we take a quick look around.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.826
What are these stains?

22:07.909 --> 22:08.910
Aren't these

22:09.619 --> 22:10.954
bloodstains?

22:11.705 --> 22:13.081
Oh, gosh.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.293
I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.129
What's strange is that

22:19.755 --> 22:22.132
this place looks different
from how it looks in the photo.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.176
Is that so? What does it look like there?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.220
Everything looks darker.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.515
Come over here. Both of you.

22:37.731 --> 22:38.899
Pig.

22:39.941 --> 22:42.569
-We have a flashlight in the car, right?
-Yes.

22:51.244 --> 22:54.623
Boss, if anything happens,
holler for help.

22:54.706 --> 22:55.874
Otherwise, I might not hear you.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.336
Just stand watch, man.

22:59.419 --> 23:02.297
Okay, Boss. Be careful down there.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.229
This is it.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.566
What is all of this?

23:25.529 --> 23:27.489
What a mess.

23:28.698 --> 23:31.034
What the heck happened here?

23:40.377 --> 23:42.087
Well, we finally found it.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.047
There's not much to it.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.300
No, there is.

23:48.009 --> 23:48.969
This is impossible.

23:50.512 --> 23:54.683
No one gave the school magazine club
tips on the location of the secret spots.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.602
It was only after
the magazine article became popular

23:58.270 --> 23:59.855
that people began submitting tips.

24:00.772 --> 24:01.815
So?

24:02.482 --> 24:04.234
This is a remote private property.

24:05.277 --> 24:09.030
It's impossible for anyone
to find this place by themselves

24:09.739 --> 24:10.907
without a tip.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.620
-Then…
-One member of the magazine club

24:17.414 --> 24:18.999
already knew about this place.

24:20.000 --> 24:23.336
And they knew
who drew that symbol there and why.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.343
Jung-hyun.

24:31.595 --> 24:34.514
Let's get out of here. Now.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.552
Yong-tak.

25:19.601 --> 25:20.560
Yong-tak?

25:21.228 --> 25:22.354
Yong-tak.

25:34.115 --> 25:37.535
This is maddening.
I think I have an upset stomach.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.621
I'm getting nervous because of you.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.625
Why were we picked for this duty?

25:43.708 --> 25:45.585
Just follow the procedure
and it'll be all right.

25:47.003 --> 25:48.255
Sir,

25:48.338 --> 25:51.508
I'm absolutely certain
he's behind the prison warden's death.

25:51.591 --> 25:52.634
Don't you think so?

25:53.843 --> 25:56.179
-It's just a baseless rumor.
-Damn it.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.931
You did hear what to do.

25:58.014 --> 26:00.684
If you just follow two rules,
you'll be fine.

26:00.767 --> 26:03.895
If he says anything to you,
don't answer him.

26:03.979 --> 26:07.440
And don't ever meet his eyes.

26:08.525 --> 26:09.567
Understand?

26:10.318 --> 26:11.194
Yes, sir.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.113
Let's get going now. We'll be late.

26:14.614 --> 26:15.782
Damn it.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.916
Please escort the prisoner.

27:13.673 --> 27:14.799
This way.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.565
Stop right there.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.777
Read it and then sign it.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.007
Excuse me.

27:59.511 --> 28:02.180
Can I borrow your pen? I don't have one.

28:06.851 --> 28:07.977
That pen.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.662
OCTOBER 4, 1999
JO KYUNG-HO

29:00.780 --> 29:02.490
Oh, I forgot the cap.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.626
Do I go in now?

29:32.187 --> 29:34.522
Hello Jo Kyung-ho. Nice to meet you.

30:11.976 --> 30:13.019
Oh, gosh.

30:14.395 --> 30:15.480
Are you awake?

30:18.024 --> 30:19.317
Who are you people?

30:19.400 --> 30:22.111
You're confused, aren't you?
Sorry about that.

30:23.112 --> 30:26.074
Your friends seem to be gangsters.

30:26.157 --> 30:28.868
So we had to take some extreme measures.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.245
What are you doing to them?

30:32.539 --> 30:34.290
The fumes are really strong.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.042
I can smell the gasoline from here.

30:41.089 --> 30:42.298
What are you doing?

30:42.882 --> 30:44.384
No! Stop!

30:47.262 --> 30:48.346
Look.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.015
I need you to make a promise.

30:51.599 --> 30:54.269
If you comply,
we'll stop what we're doing.

30:55.895 --> 30:58.106
I have a plan, you see.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.025
And I need you for this plan to work.

31:01.651 --> 31:03.027
What are you talking about?

31:03.945 --> 31:06.531
You're not in a position
to negotiate, you know.

31:07.323 --> 31:10.618
Don't try to strategize.
Just focus on the present situation.

31:11.619 --> 31:13.246
Make a decision.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.333
Ms. Jo Jung-hyun, what will it be?

31:17.417 --> 31:20.461
Will you be a part of my plan?

31:22.088 --> 31:23.089
Yes?

31:25.174 --> 31:27.886
All right. I'll do it.

31:27.969 --> 31:28.970
You will?

31:31.431 --> 31:32.974
But can I trust you?

31:33.725 --> 31:35.727
I'm a very busy person.

31:35.810 --> 31:38.146
I don't want to use
such cruel methods again.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.107
I'm busy.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.734
I'll keep my promise.

31:43.526 --> 31:44.861
So spare their lives.

31:55.246 --> 31:56.414
I'm not sure about this.

31:57.123 --> 31:58.499
I'll believe you anyway.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.795
A partnership begins
by trusting each other's words, right?

32:03.421 --> 32:04.505
Isn't that so?

32:05.506 --> 32:09.093
Jung-hyun, we've got
a strong karmic connection.

32:09.844 --> 32:11.095
Don't you agree?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.723
This is all thanks to him.

32:14.682 --> 32:16.351
Even how we're both here right now.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.103
What are you talking about?

32:20.730 --> 32:22.357
We've met before?

32:22.440 --> 32:24.943
Oh my goodness. I almost forgot.

32:25.693 --> 32:27.779
I see that you might not recognize me.

32:32.367 --> 32:33.868
It'll be all right.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.329
Because you and I

32:36.412 --> 32:39.916
might have to go through
a life-and-death situation. Right?

32:44.253 --> 32:47.465
Do you remember
the One Family Welfare Center?

32:49.884 --> 32:50.969
I'm

32:52.053 --> 32:53.805
Lim In-gwan.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.228
All right.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.356
So come to the address
on my business card.

33:03.439 --> 33:04.774
Let's have tea, okay?

33:06.234 --> 33:07.735
Let's go home, boys.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.122
Lim In-gwan…

33:20.206 --> 33:23.084
Could you elaborate on that
in more detail?

33:27.046 --> 33:29.841
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho,
I'll repeat the question.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.052
What kind of experiment is it?

33:37.306 --> 33:39.267
You're not going to answer that?

33:51.612 --> 33:52.864
Mr. Jo Kyung-ho.

33:56.534 --> 33:58.244
This is a good lighter.

34:01.706 --> 34:02.874
Don't you think so?

35:20.952 --> 35:23.454
You're back? How are your friends?

35:24.372 --> 35:25.748
They're getting better.

35:25.832 --> 35:28.209
Luckily, they weren't seriously
injured or anything.

35:28.292 --> 35:30.128
Gosh, that's a relief to hear.

35:31.045 --> 35:33.464
How about you? Have you eaten?

35:33.548 --> 35:36.634
I fixed lunch for you.
Do you have time to eat?

35:37.260 --> 35:39.470
I have to return to the hospital.
I came to pick up some stuff.

35:39.554 --> 35:40.680
Oh, really?

35:42.014 --> 35:44.767
You need to hurry back then.

35:48.729 --> 35:51.149
No, I think I'll eat lunch first.

35:51.232 --> 35:52.400
You will?

35:52.483 --> 35:53.901
I need to eat to have energy.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.821
Wow.

35:57.780 --> 35:59.907
-Thanks for the meal.
-Sure.

36:02.952 --> 36:04.453
-Mom.
-Yes?

36:04.537 --> 36:06.497
I met that person today.

36:06.581 --> 36:07.707
Who?

36:07.790 --> 36:08.916
Lim In-gwan.

36:10.001 --> 36:11.085
Do you remember him?

36:11.169 --> 36:12.753
He was the director of
the One Family Welfare Center.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.423
But I had no memory of him.

36:16.465 --> 36:17.884
So I didn't recognize his face.

36:18.509 --> 36:19.886
I have something to ask.

36:19.969 --> 36:23.264
Did something happen to me
when I was at the welfare center?

36:23.347 --> 36:27.185
Can you tell me
anything you remember from that time?

36:28.769 --> 36:32.523
Jung-hyun, this is what I think.

36:33.399 --> 36:34.400
There are

36:35.735 --> 36:37.403
some things in the past

36:38.029 --> 36:39.697
that are better to be forgotten.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.657
I've decided

36:42.909 --> 36:44.410
to bury that past.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.330
Don't you think you should forget things

36:48.080 --> 36:49.665
that need to be forgotten?

36:52.335 --> 36:53.669
Mom, I…

36:59.133 --> 37:00.176
Okay.

37:00.843 --> 37:02.386
I understand what you're saying.

37:04.764 --> 37:05.806
All right.

37:11.395 --> 37:14.732
But don't you remember that?

37:15.316 --> 37:17.276
The director's daughter

37:17.360 --> 37:19.612
would visit the welfare center
with her dad

37:19.695 --> 37:23.532
and she was particularly nice to you
out of all the other kids.

37:26.202 --> 37:27.245
She was?

37:28.079 --> 37:29.413
I don't remember.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.290
Oh, I see.

37:33.834 --> 37:36.921
She was pretty and very nice.

37:37.797 --> 37:42.593
I didn't see her much after I quit
working at the welfare center.

37:44.011 --> 37:45.513
I saw her once

37:46.639 --> 37:48.015
after she was all grown up.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.143
You did? When was this?

37:52.353 --> 37:53.437
It was…

37:57.650 --> 37:59.068
in 1987.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.738
A few days before the terrorist attack,

38:04.782 --> 38:06.659
she came to my restaurant.

38:09.704 --> 38:12.456
This isn't a simple interview, is it?

38:13.874 --> 38:15.584
What is the question
you really want to ask?

38:16.877 --> 38:18.879
Should I say it out loud for you?

38:21.173 --> 38:23.718
Am I involved in
the kidnapping of my daughter?

38:24.427 --> 38:28.014
Do I have anything to do with
the murders or the Youngjin sect?

38:28.681 --> 38:32.268
What is the real purpose
behind these incidents?

38:32.852 --> 38:33.894
Am I right?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.150
Or maybe not?

38:41.694 --> 38:44.405
What you're really curious
about is this, isn't it?

38:46.657 --> 38:48.034
Who is Guru?

38:48.784 --> 38:51.078
Could I be Guru?

38:51.746 --> 38:53.205
Then please answer the question.

38:53.831 --> 38:54.999
Mr. Jo.

38:56.250 --> 38:57.418
Are you Guru?

38:58.085 --> 39:00.588
I guessed it correctly.
That was it all along, right?

39:02.006 --> 39:03.215
Mr. Jo.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.220
It's amusing.

39:09.930 --> 39:14.185
You already picked an answer,
but you keep asking the same question.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.317
You're right.

39:22.985 --> 39:24.362
I'm Guru.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.163
Isn't that what you want to hear?

39:39.543 --> 39:42.505
But there's something I have to tell you
before we get into that.

39:43.172 --> 39:46.717
I didn't come here to tell you
what you want to hear.

39:46.801 --> 39:47.843
What do you mean?

39:47.927 --> 39:51.055
Let's stop wasting each other's time.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.599
I don't have anything else to say to you.

39:53.682 --> 39:55.017
What do you think about that?

39:56.018 --> 39:57.103
Detective Choi.

39:58.479 --> 40:01.732
You're the one
who wants to talk to me, right?

40:02.733 --> 40:04.527
Now that will be more interesting.

40:06.070 --> 40:08.072
Because I have a lot of stories

40:08.155 --> 40:12.118
to tell about you
that you're not aware of.

40:14.870 --> 40:16.163
Look here, Mr. Jo.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.665
So are you ready to hear it?

40:17.748 --> 40:19.333
What do you mean?

40:19.417 --> 40:20.793
Listen to what I say.

40:24.004 --> 40:26.757
It's about your late wife, Lim Se-yoon.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.053
I didn't know

40:31.679 --> 40:34.557
she was the director's daughter
when she came to our restaurant.

40:35.808 --> 40:37.726
She told me when she was paying the bill.

40:42.356 --> 40:44.150
Did you enjoy the food?

40:44.233 --> 40:45.317
That'll be 2,000 won.

40:54.910 --> 40:57.413
I was minding the restaurant
while carrying Jae-young on my back.

40:57.496 --> 40:59.081
So it was a hectic day.

41:00.207 --> 41:01.333
But she was

41:02.293 --> 41:03.502
acting weird.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.005
She came by herself at a very late hour.

41:06.630 --> 41:10.342
So I asked a couple of questions.
How her life was and such.

41:10.426 --> 41:14.305
She told me she got married
and lived in Seoul.

41:14.388 --> 41:16.640
But she recently moved back to our town.

41:17.558 --> 41:19.018
Her husband was a police officer.

41:20.394 --> 41:21.729
A police officer?

41:22.771 --> 41:24.106
What kind of nonsense

41:25.316 --> 41:27.151
are you talking about?

41:27.234 --> 41:28.319
Detective Choi.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.825
After your wife died, you've lived
with regrets all your life, right?

41:35.493 --> 41:37.244
You hated me.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.331
You hated the world.
You're barely hanging on.

41:40.414 --> 41:42.833
-Hey, Kyung-ho.
-But what's funny is…

41:44.126 --> 41:47.296
you don't know
the source of the rage within you

41:48.172 --> 41:51.675
that keeps growing day by day.
Why is that?

41:52.384 --> 41:53.511
It's because

41:54.303 --> 41:55.971
you don't know anything.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.933
You don't know why your wife left you

41:59.016 --> 42:02.561
and why she was at Saju Station
on that particular date and time

42:03.479 --> 42:05.689
when the attack occurred.

42:07.525 --> 42:08.692
That's enough.

42:08.776 --> 42:10.319
That day, you were…

42:11.237 --> 42:13.531
I mean, I'm talking
about the day your wife died.

42:15.199 --> 42:19.161
Do you think you could have stopped it
if you were able to go back in time?

42:20.663 --> 42:23.415
Do you think you could have saved her?

42:23.499 --> 42:24.583
Damn it.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.671
Shut up, you bastard.

42:28.754 --> 42:30.214
I'll answer that for you.

42:32.091 --> 42:34.385
You could

42:36.011 --> 42:38.055
never have saved your wife.

42:38.138 --> 42:39.348
You bastard.

42:39.431 --> 42:41.892
Do you know why your wife left you?

42:41.976 --> 42:43.811
The unborn baby you had with her…

42:45.854 --> 42:46.897
You named it Gureum.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.983
After your wife's miscarriage,

42:49.066 --> 42:52.278
she wanted to start
a whole, new life with me.

42:52.778 --> 42:55.406
She and I went to Japan together.

43:00.452 --> 43:02.246
But later on,

43:04.999 --> 43:06.750
it occurred to me.

43:10.296 --> 43:12.715
I think she came to the restaurant

43:15.884 --> 43:18.554
to see Jae-young.

43:20.222 --> 43:21.682
I think she might have been

43:23.976 --> 43:25.352
Jae-young's mother.

43:34.862 --> 43:38.616
So her death wasn't in vain.

43:38.699 --> 43:40.492
She had a baby before she died.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.620
To start a new life with me
and to usher in a new beginning.

43:42.703 --> 43:43.996
Understand?

43:44.496 --> 43:46.498
It wasn't you.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.960
I was the one she loved in the end.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.507
-Hold him down!
-Detective Choi.

43:55.591 --> 43:58.302
-Detective Choi, calm down.
-Let go!

43:58.385 --> 44:01.221
-Please calm down.
-You bastard!

44:01.305 --> 44:03.515
-Detective Choi, calm down.
-Let go!

44:03.599 --> 44:05.142
Let go of me!

44:05.225 --> 44:07.728
-Please calm down.
-Please!

44:07.811 --> 44:10.314
You bastard! Let go.

44:10.397 --> 44:12.024
Let go of me!

44:15.611 --> 44:18.322
Master, I brought you your meal.

44:18.405 --> 44:20.741
Okay.

44:42.429 --> 44:46.016
I'll wait outside the door.
After you're done eating--

44:46.100 --> 44:47.184
You know…

44:48.686 --> 44:50.646
-I'm sorry, but…
-Pardon?

44:50.729 --> 44:53.065
we're the same age, aren't we?

44:53.816 --> 44:55.317
I think we are.

44:56.110 --> 44:58.362
Yes, I also think so.

44:59.696 --> 45:00.781
You know…

45:00.864 --> 45:05.119
Could you just talk to me
without saying, "Master?"

45:05.202 --> 45:07.413
You're always serving me food like this.

45:07.996 --> 45:10.499
Oh, I wouldn't dare to.

45:10.582 --> 45:14.378
Do it as a favor. Can we just be friends?

45:18.882 --> 45:22.553
The representative gave me orders
to always address you respectfully.

45:22.636 --> 45:25.097
How about only when
nobody is around except us?

45:28.767 --> 45:31.228
Okay. When there's nobody around, I'll…

45:34.106 --> 45:34.940
Thanks.

45:35.023 --> 45:37.151
I really need someone to talk to.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.446
What's your name? I'm Jo Jae-young.

45:41.029 --> 45:43.574
I… I'm Yoon Shi-young.

45:44.241 --> 45:46.869
Oh, nice to know you, Shi-young.

45:48.078 --> 45:49.204
And

45:49.830 --> 45:52.583
can you just talk freely

45:54.084 --> 45:56.044
if it's not too much of a trouble?

45:58.755 --> 45:59.840
All right, I guess.

45:59.923 --> 46:01.175
Yes!

46:03.886 --> 46:06.805
I was nervous that you might say no.

46:08.849 --> 46:10.809
-But you know what.
-Yes?

46:10.893 --> 46:12.144
I think the representative is here.

46:18.525 --> 46:19.985
Is the successor in?

46:20.611 --> 46:22.821
I just served the master her meal.

46:22.905 --> 46:24.239
Can I come in?

46:24.323 --> 46:26.158
Yes, come in.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.422
I've told you many times before.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.967
You must address the successor properly.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.513
I'm sorry.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.475
And when she is eating,
you're supposed to wait outside.

46:52.100 --> 46:55.312
I needed to ask him about my meals.
That's why he's here.

46:55.896 --> 46:56.980
I see.

47:00.651 --> 47:01.818
Raise your head.

47:02.903 --> 47:05.697
You have a great responsibility
in serving the successor.

47:05.781 --> 47:06.823
Please take it seriously.

47:07.699 --> 47:08.575
Okay.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.877
I have something to tell you.

47:30.055 --> 47:31.014
I heard that

47:31.640 --> 47:33.892
you failed in attaining
enlightenment again today.

47:37.020 --> 47:37.896
Yes.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.693
Yes? That's not the proper answer.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.611
How can you say that so easily?

47:44.695 --> 47:48.198
Do you know what position you occupy
in our religious movement?

47:48.282 --> 47:50.158
He'll be very disappointed.

47:50.242 --> 47:52.244
Guru will be very dismayed
when he hears this.

47:53.161 --> 47:57.457
If this continues,
I won't be able to keep my promise.

47:57.541 --> 48:01.336
The promise I made
to protect your family members.

48:03.672 --> 48:05.340
I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.426
You've been saying that for months!

48:09.094 --> 48:10.387
I'm very scared.

48:11.221 --> 48:15.267
I don't sense it from you, Successor.
The energy that he emanates.

48:22.065 --> 48:25.360
Please don't forget
that you're his bloodline, Successor.

48:25.444 --> 48:27.654
Please take time

48:28.572 --> 48:30.866
to reflect on yourself.

48:31.491 --> 48:35.454
Today, I wish you'll focus on
practicing Kundalini.

48:36.204 --> 48:37.331
Do you understand?

48:39.374 --> 48:40.292
Yes.

48:47.758 --> 48:49.593
Then please eat your meal, Successor.

49:41.728 --> 49:43.563
You girls already got here.

49:43.647 --> 49:45.691
I thought I would get here sooner.

49:45.774 --> 49:47.275
Hi Aunt.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.237
Seung-hyun's dad gave us a ride.
So it didn't take long.

49:51.947 --> 49:54.116
How are you feeling?

49:54.199 --> 49:55.909
Oh my. Don't worry about me.

49:55.992 --> 49:58.912
I'm fit enough to win an Olympic
gold medal if I were competing right now.

49:58.995 --> 50:00.789
Mister, stop eating it all.

50:00.872 --> 50:03.291
Leave some for him.
He hasn't tried it yet.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.668
You should stop eating it.

50:06.294 --> 50:07.295
Hi.

50:08.380 --> 50:09.506
What are you doing?

50:10.173 --> 50:12.801
She asked me to help her with this.

50:12.884 --> 50:15.470
Darn. It's not easy.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.723
-What is it?
-Turning a tape inside-out.

50:19.641 --> 50:21.226
-Inside-out?
-Yes.

50:21.309 --> 50:23.395
You can listen to
the reverse side this way.

50:25.313 --> 50:28.400
They were interviewing him and then…

50:29.860 --> 50:31.987
It happened so quickly.

50:59.431 --> 51:00.932
Let's leave this room first.

51:01.016 --> 51:03.393
Seung-dae, go and gather our equipment.

51:12.486 --> 51:15.697
It was still recording this whole time.

51:23.955 --> 51:26.708
How did you find this magazine issue?

51:27.584 --> 51:29.961
There was one copy left
at the school library.

51:30.045 --> 51:32.798
Jae-young told us to check the 1987 issue.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.802
So we read the entire magazine.

51:38.386 --> 51:39.304
And?

51:39.387 --> 51:40.806
At first, we thought Jae-young

51:41.473 --> 51:44.643
was telling us to read the article
about the mysteries.

51:44.726 --> 51:47.479
But that wasn't it.

51:47.562 --> 51:50.816
If you look at the very back,
you'll understand.

51:52.234 --> 51:54.528
GYEONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL
SCHOOL MAGAZINE CLUB

51:54.611 --> 51:55.737
What about this?

51:56.738 --> 51:58.865
No, the last page.

52:00.867 --> 52:02.619
There's nothing on the last page.

52:05.497 --> 52:06.665
What is this?

52:06.748 --> 52:08.041
THIS IS OUR SECRET.
PLAY THE CASSETTE TAPE IN REVERSE

52:09.167 --> 52:12.045
We don’t know who wrote that.

52:13.171 --> 52:17.175
But I think Jae-young
is talking about that.

52:18.260 --> 52:22.389
We couldn't figure out
how to play a tape in reverse.

52:23.098 --> 52:24.891
But a few days ago, we found the solution.

52:25.559 --> 52:28.353
You have to flip the tape upside down.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.231
Which tape?

52:32.274 --> 52:36.111
The cassette tape you gave to the police?

52:36.194 --> 52:37.237
Yes.

52:37.320 --> 52:41.366
Someone left it in front of
the broadcasting room and then ran away.

52:42.284 --> 52:46.037
Actually, I made a copy

52:47.330 --> 52:48.707
when I had it.

52:49.624 --> 52:50.876
Just in case.

52:52.627 --> 52:54.838
Hey, I sure put my skills to work today.

52:56.172 --> 52:57.215
I'm done.

52:58.300 --> 52:59.676
Are you both ready to listen to it?

53:19.613 --> 53:21.156
I remember putting it in my bag.

53:21.907 --> 53:23.742
I knew you'd forget.

53:24.409 --> 53:26.244
Then why didn't you bring yours?

53:26.328 --> 53:29.623
My sister uses my cassette player
to study English.

53:30.415 --> 53:31.833
What now?

53:31.917 --> 53:33.501
We can't listen to it?

53:34.836 --> 53:36.212
Maybe we can ask a nurse.

53:36.296 --> 53:39.049
They must have a cassette player
somewhere in this hospital.

53:40.050 --> 53:41.134
Girls.

53:42.010 --> 53:46.264
Could I take this with me
and listen to it at home?

53:47.057 --> 53:48.266
Well, that's…

53:49.935 --> 53:51.102
Please.

53:53.021 --> 53:55.690
Okay, Aunt. You can borrow it.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.609
Aunt should be the one
to listen to it first.

53:57.692 --> 53:58.860
See.

53:58.944 --> 54:01.071
It worked out fine, right?

54:01.696 --> 54:03.323
No, not really.

54:04.074 --> 54:06.368
Why? You forgot to bring the player.

54:06.910 --> 54:09.746
-Look, because I didn't bring it…
-It's your fault.

54:16.878 --> 54:18.880
I'm sorry for
getting you involved in this.

54:18.964 --> 54:22.384
It's okay. I've seen worse things happen
during interviews with inmates.

54:22.467 --> 54:24.052
Don't let this bother you.

54:24.135 --> 54:26.346
Let's talk again after you get some rest.

54:27.180 --> 54:29.975
I'll give you the interview recordings
when I meet you next time.

54:30.684 --> 54:32.769
Could you please do that? Thanks.

55:59.981 --> 56:02.025
Hey, make sure you lock the door
when you leave.

56:05.070 --> 56:06.905
-Thanks.
-Sure.

56:09.324 --> 56:10.492
All right.

56:14.162 --> 56:16.498
Let's see if we recorded everything.

56:22.545 --> 56:23.797
Number three.

57:09.467 --> 57:10.844
What's that?

57:32.115 --> 57:33.992
-Are you heading home?
-Yes. Good night.

57:34.075 --> 57:35.618
-Good night.
-Good night.

57:39.998 --> 57:43.960
PROFESSOR KOO BYUNG-MIN
DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY

57:56.139 --> 57:57.265
Yes, Honey.

57:58.641 --> 58:00.268
I'm going home soon.

58:01.394 --> 58:03.021
I'll arrive sooner, I guess.

58:04.147 --> 58:06.399
I bought all the items
in the list you texted me.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.151
Is there anything else you need?

58:09.360 --> 58:11.446
I'll see you later, Honey.

59:02.121 --> 59:05.291
<i>I keep seeing a lady.</i>

59:06.584 --> 59:10.547
<i>She's crouched inside the bathtub.</i>

59:12.423 --> 59:15.802
<i>She keeps following me.</i>

59:18.179 --> 59:19.305
<i>If…</i>

59:20.014 --> 59:21.558
<i>If I weren't you,</i>

59:21.641 --> 59:23.685
<i>I would've never gone to that cram school.</i>

59:24.602 --> 59:25.562
<i>Guru…</i>

59:26.229 --> 59:28.523
<i>And I wouldn't have
listened to him either.</i>

59:30.316 --> 59:32.110
<i>If you hadn't come to this town,</i>

59:32.819 --> 59:35.029
<i>this wouldn't be happening to me.</i>

59:37.532 --> 59:40.243
<i>Now the lady is</i>

59:41.703 --> 59:43.371
<i>coming closer.</i>

59:47.083 --> 59:50.044
<i>They're going to take you away.</i>

59:52.046 --> 59:55.300
<i>I wonder if you can escape.</i>

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:03.433
<i>Now the lady</i>

1:00:04.225 --> 1:00:05.810
<i>is right in front of me.</i>

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:13.860
<i>It's because of you that I'll die.</i>

1:00:26.789 --> 1:00:29.417
<i>Jo Jae-young,</i>

1:00:30.376 --> 1:00:31.753
<i>you killed me.</i>

1:01:02.367 --> 1:01:06.245
<i>I've been waiting for you for a long time.</i>

1:01:06.954 --> 1:01:10.416
All of the places we've visited so far
are connected to one person.

1:01:11.793 --> 1:01:13.670
He won't stop. There'll be more victims.

1:01:13.753 --> 1:01:15.880
You're not making any sense, damn it.

1:01:15.963 --> 1:01:19.050
-I'm willing to help you.
-You're part of the cult too.

1:01:19.133 --> 1:01:20.468
Why did you do that?

1:01:20.551 --> 1:01:21.761
Yong-tak.

1:01:21.844 --> 1:01:24.931
<i>Whoever watched the videotape
won't survive.</i>

1:01:25.890 --> 1:01:28.893
<i>You can't change a predetermined future.</i>
