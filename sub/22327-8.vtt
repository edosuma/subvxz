WEBVTT

00:21.104 --> 00:22.230
Targeting far left.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.531
TELL established. Standby, target two.

00:35.660 --> 00:36.786
TELL established.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.330
[whirring]

00:39.414 --> 00:40.707
[groans]

00:41.458 --> 00:43.126
Traveler incoming on target one.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.087
[MacLaren] Take him out.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.339
[man grunts]

00:57.057 --> 00:59.434
-I'm 3468.
-5401.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.062
-[Marcy] Yeah, he's dead.
-We needed three to make it even.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.480
He was gonna kill both of you.

01:03.563 --> 01:06.024
Stay calm, stick to the plan.
We'll be right behind you.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.495
[door opens]

01:20.455 --> 01:21.289
What are you doing?

01:21.372 --> 01:24.292
-What do you mean? It's lunchtime.
-You're supposed to be on sentry duty.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.919
Oh, Jasper's still out there. It's fine.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.670
No, it's not fine.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.255
There could be travelers out there.

01:29.339 --> 01:30.173
They're in here now.

01:31.132 --> 01:32.592
-Don't!
-Hands in the air.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.222
Your protocols won't let you
take a life.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.849
Protocol three's been suspended
for members of the Faction.

01:39.933 --> 01:40.850
I wouldn't risk it.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.352
[Carly] Weapons down, hands up.

01:42.435 --> 01:44.229
Where's the quantum frame?

01:45.522 --> 01:46.773
Not here.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.775
Secure them.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.404
What are you gonna do with us?

01:53.988 --> 01:55.073
That'll be up to the Director.

01:55.657 --> 01:57.033
So, death by override.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.660
[Marcy] You mean what you did
to your hosts?

01:58.743 --> 02:00.370
Our plan would have saved the future.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.831
You people are pathetic.

02:02.914 --> 02:07.377
Meaning we're capable of pity,
sympathy or compassion for others?

02:08.211 --> 02:10.213
I've really been enjoying
the English classes here.

02:10.296 --> 02:11.297
Yeah, I can see that.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.465
Let's get moving.

02:12.549 --> 02:13.383
Move.

02:18.721 --> 02:19.556
Stay still.

02:27.147 --> 02:30.233
Okay. Let's see what
we can pull from this.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.693
You won't find anything.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.653
I don't know, my people
are pretty good at this.

02:33.736 --> 02:34.737
Thanks, boss.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.072
-Be good at this.
-Mm-hmm.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.450
We can always try torture.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.785
No, we couldn't.

02:41.536 --> 02:42.620
They've been in hiding so long,

02:42.704 --> 02:44.706
I doubt they know
where the frame is anyway.

02:44.789 --> 02:46.624
Even if we knew, we wouldn't tell you,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.752
so someone point a fucking camera this way
and end this.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.962
I'm good with that.

02:51.045 --> 02:52.672
The Director has plans for them.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.175
This is the first I'm hearing about it.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.178
Because you are a part of those plans.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.096
A hearing has been ordered.

03:00.179 --> 03:02.265
Your presence, along with 3569

03:02.348 --> 03:04.058
and 0115 is required.

03:04.851 --> 03:05.685
Where?

03:06.394 --> 03:08.062
You'll receive
the coordinates tomorrow.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.588
[cork pops]

03:42.138 --> 03:43.556
To selling our house.

03:44.015 --> 03:45.850
To selling our house over asking.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.353
Yay! We're officially homeless.

03:48.436 --> 03:49.771
Well, I am.

03:49.854 --> 03:52.482
-Mm. Not till you finish packing.
-[glasses clink]

03:52.565 --> 03:53.483
Hmm.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.237
I don't know how you can drink that stuff.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.905
Because I'm not allowed
to drink that stuff,

03:59.572 --> 04:01.282
and the calcium is good for bones.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.201
You haven't touched
the almond milk I bought.

04:03.284 --> 04:06.079
If there was ever a time you were
gonna lose this vegan battle with me,

04:06.162 --> 04:07.413
it's when I'm pregnant.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.373
Fair.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.753
I was thinking we should put some
of our house money into a trust fund,

04:13.836 --> 04:15.088
for college tuition and--

04:15.171 --> 04:17.924
College? That's years from now.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.635
You need to learn to think of the future.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.806
Oh, I have given that some thought.

04:24.889 --> 04:28.518
And I think I'm gonna buy a boat
with my half.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.105
Given your history with the water,

04:32.188 --> 04:34.774
I'd better take a life insurance policy
out on you instead.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.692
Ow.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.860
Break one arm one time.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.333
Are you planning
on going to the house tonight?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.461
It's early. You kicking me out already?

04:55.545 --> 04:56.546
No.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.382
I'm asking you to stay.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.897
You haven't changed position
since last night.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.817
Oh. No, I guess I haven't.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.155
Find anything on the comms?

05:23.614 --> 05:25.199
They've been all over the place.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.077
This data is pretty much useless.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.164
What about these points?

05:31.247 --> 05:33.666
Looks like they frequented
these locations multiple times.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.501
Maybe the frame's there.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.171
Where the frame might have been,
not where it is now.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.258
Well, there's got to be CCTV
or traffic cams in those areas.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.553
Maybe you can pull the footage,
see if any of them picked anything up.

05:45.636 --> 05:47.013
If the Faction left anything
on those cameras--

05:47.096 --> 05:49.057
and, hey, I wouldn't--

05:49.640 --> 05:51.517
the Director would have
already found it by now.

05:52.769 --> 05:53.770
[soft moan]

05:55.021 --> 05:55.855
[moan]

05:57.023 --> 05:58.232
Something's bothering you.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.318
The time line has changed a lot.

06:01.652 --> 06:03.780
My knowledge of the future
is becoming obsolete.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.907
It's going to be hard
to stay relevant.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.701
You're more than just the team's
encyclopedia, Philip.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.662
Who else am I gonna call

06:11.746 --> 06:14.165
when I can't get Jeffrey's cartoons
to play on my phone?

06:14.248 --> 06:15.249
So flattering.

06:15.333 --> 06:18.920
Or make me music playlists.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.630
Teach me about turtles.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.341
Self-worth is just coursing
through my veins.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.259
You're like the rest of us now.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.971
Just a human being. And that's okay.

06:33.601 --> 06:35.186
I gotta go to work, but I'll comm in.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.857
Have a nice day.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.317
Go for a walk.

07:00.211 --> 07:02.171
[both laughing]

07:02.255 --> 07:04.674
Oh, my God.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.677
I guess we were making up
for lost time.

07:07.760 --> 07:08.719
Lost time?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.430
I don't even know what day it is.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.556
[chuckles] I know.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.687
I'm gonna be in court all day, so...

07:18.438 --> 07:19.605
I'll be hard to reach.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.358
But I'll see you tonight?

07:34.454 --> 07:35.663
How's that for an answer?

07:42.670 --> 07:43.504
Grant.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.133
I love you.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.344
I love you, too.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.855
3468, coordinates are as follows:

08:00.938 --> 08:03.816
47.6050 degrees north,

08:03.900 --> 08:06.986
by 122.3344 degrees west.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.114
Why am I in the hallway?

08:11.240 --> 08:12.241
Is it time for school?

08:12.825 --> 08:13.659
Not yet.

08:14.619 --> 08:16.245
Are you our new neighbor?

08:18.915 --> 08:20.333
I guess I am.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.169
Have a nice day, neighbor.

08:47.652 --> 08:48.569
What are you doing here?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.322
-What are you doing here?
-He asked first.

08:51.405 --> 08:53.241
A messenger gave me the coordinates
for a hearing.

08:53.324 --> 08:54.867
Scared me half to death.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.000
Maybe it's their trial.

09:03.084 --> 09:04.961
Shouldn't take long, then.

09:11.968 --> 09:14.595
All rise for the arrival
of the tribunal committee.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.308
[whirring]

09:21.561 --> 09:23.563
[whirring continuing]

09:23.646 --> 09:25.106
[screaming]

09:28.025 --> 09:30.486
[screaming continuing]

09:49.005 --> 09:50.798
I'm traveler 009.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.883
You may refer to me as the Speaker.

09:53.634 --> 09:56.095
I am joined by travelers 0017

09:56.178 --> 09:57.597
and 0029.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.806
They're programmers.

09:58.889 --> 10:02.268
What the hell are all of you doing here?
Who's maintaining the Director?

10:02.351 --> 10:03.894
0027...

10:04.687 --> 10:07.273
we came to the 21st
as instructed by the Director.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.400
Unlike yourself.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.237
So that's what this is about.

10:13.779 --> 10:17.950
0027, you are charged
with conspiracy against the Director

10:18.034 --> 10:21.203
and the high crime
of interrupting the Grand Plan.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.425
[pop music playing on radio]

10:43.142 --> 10:44.977
[song ends]

10:45.061 --> 10:48.105
I liked that one.
Can you add it to my playlist?

10:48.189 --> 10:51.734
And just like that, I am reduced
to being Carly's deejay.

10:52.234 --> 10:53.444
[chuckles]

10:53.527 --> 10:54.904
Something upbeat, please.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.115
Any luck with the footage?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.701
They wiped everything,
just like we thought.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.579
I'm running serial numbers
of the weapons they were carrying.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
Grasping at straws here.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.874
They're bound to slip up.

11:06.957 --> 11:08.584
When they do, we'll be ready for them.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.212
Dropping by Ops after work?

11:11.295 --> 11:14.173
No.
I gotta pick up Jeffrey from the sitter,

11:14.256 --> 11:16.008
get some groceries and...

11:16.092 --> 11:18.511
[sighs] bring my van to the mechanic.

11:18.594 --> 11:20.805
I'm having trouble starting it
in the mornings.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.432
Maybe I could be a mechanic.

11:24.016 --> 11:24.934
I do live in a garage.

11:25.017 --> 11:28.437
[sighs]  Stop it.
You are a valuable member of the team.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.147
And a great deejay.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.317
Next song, please.

11:39.698 --> 11:41.617
[0017] 3468, please take the stand.

11:53.337 --> 11:57.049
Recount to us how you first made contact
with 0027.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.262
I met Grace several months ago
when my team was given a mission

12:01.345 --> 12:04.265
to great traveler 0014, Ellis.

12:04.724 --> 12:08.519
Grace arrived at the same time,
said her mission was to help Marcy.

12:08.602 --> 12:10.438
[0017] But that was a lie, wasn't it?

12:10.521 --> 12:12.064
No, it wasn't. I saved her life.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.358
The defendant will refrain
from interjection.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.444
If you refrain from leading questions.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.112
Go ahead. He interrupted you.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.867
Later we learned she was actually here
to reset the Director

12:22.950 --> 12:25.536
by taking advantage
of Marcy's new TELL.

12:25.619 --> 12:27.746
And you were unaware
of the secondary objective?

12:27.830 --> 12:29.415
She eventually told us.

12:29.498 --> 12:31.876
Prior to that, we believed
she was only here to save Marcy.

12:31.959 --> 12:32.793
Which I did.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.670
And for which I am deeply grateful.

12:34.753 --> 12:35.588
You're welcome.

12:35.671 --> 12:39.049
At any point, did you suspect
that she was a member of the Faction?

12:39.133 --> 12:41.427
In the future we left,
there was no Faction.

12:41.510 --> 12:45.097
Protocol two has kept us in the dark.
We had no idea.

12:45.681 --> 12:46.891
And who wrote protocol two?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.601
Oh, come on, you know I did.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.894
0027, please.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.397
Teams in the 21st shouldn't be made aware
of every change in the future

12:53.481 --> 12:56.817
because completion rates of our
missions would drop exponentially.

12:56.901 --> 12:59.487
You have been asked
by the tribunal not to interject.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.530
Operatives will be paralyzed by the fear

13:01.614 --> 13:04.200
of how their actions could negatively
affect the people they left behind.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.494
-Enough.
-I agree.

13:06.577 --> 13:10.039
If I hadn't reset the Director,
the Faction would have corrupted it,

13:10.122 --> 13:12.249
which means the Faction
would have control of the past.

13:12.333 --> 13:16.879
What I did was the only way
to save Marcy and the Director.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.548
It was the Director
who ordered this hearing.

13:20.633 --> 13:21.884
Not any one of us.

13:21.967 --> 13:22.927
Why?

13:24.512 --> 13:27.223
It knows what really happened.
It knows what I sacrificed.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.350
This makes no sense.

13:30.392 --> 13:31.560
And yet here we are.

13:32.561 --> 13:36.774
We will take a brief recess
to allow that fact to sink in.

13:48.369 --> 13:49.620
Blair, hi, it's David.

13:49.703 --> 13:51.163
I--

13:51.247 --> 13:52.957
Hi! You're still at home.

13:53.832 --> 13:57.169
Yeah, I was just calling to leave
a message and wish you a happy birthday.

13:57.253 --> 14:00.297
So, uh, happy birthday.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.427
Yeah. Anywho, that's the one
and only reason I was calling,

14:05.511 --> 14:06.804
so have a great...

14:08.389 --> 14:10.391
A rave?! [chuckles]

14:10.850 --> 14:13.060
Oh... no.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.479
No, no, I don't, um...

14:16.480 --> 14:17.898
I don't do rave.

14:18.691 --> 14:19.525
It's just not my--

14:22.278 --> 14:23.904
Tell you what-- I'll say maybe.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.115
And, uh...

14:27.116 --> 14:28.409
Yeah.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.493
I'll try.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.497
Yeah, I'll try to maybe see you later.

14:35.499 --> 14:37.501
Okay. Yeah, bye.

14:42.089 --> 14:43.507
0115...

14:45.301 --> 14:48.596
were you responsible for
interrupting Grace Day's original TELL?

14:48.679 --> 14:49.889
I was.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.599
Whose orders were you acting on?

14:51.682 --> 14:52.975
No one.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.059
Then why'd you do it?

14:54.143 --> 14:56.520
I didn't want her to die. That simple.

14:57.771 --> 15:00.190
As a traveler,
you don't just inherit the host's body,

15:00.274 --> 15:03.360
you inherit the lives they've touched,
family, friends.

15:04.528 --> 15:07.740
Grace Day was merely
a guidance counselor

15:07.823 --> 15:11.243
-at your host's high school.
-That doesn't do her justice.

15:11.327 --> 15:12.828
See, my host was a bully.

15:12.912 --> 15:13.913
Cruel.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.999
She tried to help him anyway.
She was there for him.

15:17.082 --> 15:18.083
For me.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.003
[Speaker] And historically,
she was supposed to die.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.715
I rationalized that one person
wouldn't matter to the Grand Plan.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.717
But I was lying to myself.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.970
I broke protocol
because she did matter to me.

15:31.138 --> 15:33.474
And I'm willing
to accept the consequences.

15:34.058 --> 15:37.311
Because of your actions, 0027

15:37.394 --> 15:39.438
locked out all transfers to the 21st

15:39.521 --> 15:42.483
until she could send herself
into the host Grace Day,

15:42.566 --> 15:44.777
halting the traveler program
for four hours.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.695
I couldn't just go into anyone.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.530
Dozens of missions were canceled.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.366
A traveler was supposed
to arrive in Germany

15:50.449 --> 15:52.493
and prevent
an impending train derailment.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.536
All the passengers died.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.957
A team meant to arrive in England
and stop a terrorist attack

15:58.040 --> 15:59.500
was unable to transit.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.585
[Trevor] I assumed the Director
would choose a new host

16:01.669 --> 16:03.087
for the next scheduled traveler.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.172
The Grand Plan is fluid.
It's constantly shifting.

16:05.255 --> 16:08.008
The Director is constantly analyzing
a myriad of outcomes

16:08.092 --> 16:10.219
and course-correcting
to the fraction of a second.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.513
Are you trying to school me
in the matrix of algorithms

16:12.596 --> 16:15.265
the Director uses
to oversee the traveler program?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.725
[Speaker] For the last time, 027.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.728
[Trevor] If the crime is disruption
of the Grand Plan,

16:19.812 --> 16:21.772
then I'm the one that
allowed that to happen.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.608
I'm the one that should be punished.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.278
[Speaker] The Director will no doubt
take it into account.

16:29.613 --> 16:30.823
You may step down.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.750
2103,

16:41.834 --> 16:43.252
will you please take the stand.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.170
Oh, seriously? That guy hates me.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.852
Philip, I have a situation.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.103
[comm beeps]

17:01.186 --> 17:02.813
Hey, what's the good news?

17:02.896 --> 17:04.898
Definitely not my paycheck.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.651
How the hell do they expect people
to live on this?

17:07.735 --> 17:11.113
And the capitalist-socialist
debate strikes again.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.407
This isn't enough for me
to cover my expenses this week.

17:13.490 --> 17:14.491
Can you top me up?

17:14.575 --> 17:17.161
Sure. Let me see what I can
move around for you.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.470
[Philip] This can't be right.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.056
What? What is it?

17:37.139 --> 17:40.934
Something happened to the market
this morning when I was out for a walk.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.312
Our investments are down.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.149
I'm scared to tell you how much.

17:47.232 --> 17:48.358
How did that happen?

17:48.442 --> 17:51.236
Most of our high-risk investments
just crashed and burned.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.656
We are in serious financial trouble.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.869
This was a meeting Ken
had been preparing for, for a month.

17:58.952 --> 18:02.331
I mean, he had--
he had note cards and everything.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.625
-[cell phone vibrating]
-And, uh...

18:07.586 --> 18:08.837
Even had his hair slicked back,

18:08.921 --> 18:11.173
which is a clear sign that,
you know, it's important.

18:11.256 --> 18:12.091
[Marcy chuckles]

18:12.174 --> 18:13.634
[cell phone vibrates]

18:13.717 --> 18:15.219
You gonna get that?

18:15.302 --> 18:17.137
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.932
-Anyway...
-[clears throat]

18:20.015 --> 18:24.019
...so, we're all sitting there,
and he stands up to do his presentation,

18:24.103 --> 18:26.438
and his fly, it's wide open.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.941
Oh, no. Was his penis exposed?

18:30.943 --> 18:32.444
Uh... no.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.363
No, I mean, that would--
that would be--

18:35.489 --> 18:36.698
but, anyway, there's a...

18:37.783 --> 18:39.243
window in his office,

18:39.910 --> 18:42.079
and I think midway through,
he must have caught his reflection

18:42.162 --> 18:43.914
because he just--

18:43.997 --> 18:45.624
he just knew.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.334
There was nothing
he could do about it,

18:47.417 --> 18:50.462
but you could see him debate it
in his head, like,

18:50.546 --> 18:53.132
"Do I do up my fly
while I'm still talking?"

18:53.215 --> 18:54.216
[chuckles]

18:54.299 --> 18:57.386
-Have I met Ken?
-It's a funny thing. You actually have.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.097
You've actually asked
that question before.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.141
Oh.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.603
[inhales deeply] This looks good.

19:06.687 --> 19:07.646
[vibrates]

19:08.689 --> 19:10.691
[dance music playing]

19:29.668 --> 19:32.713
Blair, you're not allowed
to do this on your birthday!

19:32.796 --> 19:35.257
He is so not worth it.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.925
Hold on to me.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.221
[dance music continuing]

19:50.314 --> 19:52.024
[dance music continuing]

20:08.373 --> 20:10.959
-[whirring]
-[music stops]

20:12.669 --> 20:14.880
-[whirring continuing]
-[screaming]

20:22.721 --> 20:24.681
[screaming stops]

20:31.939 --> 20:32.940
What's happening?

20:40.239 --> 20:41.448
[vibrates]

20:41.531 --> 20:44.368
Then why did, um,
why did Ken change his mind?

20:44.451 --> 20:45.661
I don't know.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.830
I came in ready to pack up all my things,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.917
and he... told me I still had a job.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.211
It's a mystery.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.631
Do you want more wine?

20:57.714 --> 20:59.132
Um, maybe in a minute.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.592
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.510
Excuse me.

21:01.593 --> 21:02.427
Oh.

21:05.222 --> 21:06.723
[beeping]

21:13.897 --> 21:16.942
[Blair]  David, please, I don't know
what's going on! I need your help!

21:17.025 --> 21:18.026
[Blair screams]

21:18.110 --> 21:21.405
I'm locked in a stall.
They're trying to come in. Please help me!

21:21.488 --> 21:22.823
[Blair screams]

21:25.117 --> 21:27.577
Uh... [groans]

21:32.791 --> 21:33.792
Where are you going?

21:33.875 --> 21:36.378
Uh... here. Listen to this.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.088
[Blair]  I don't know what's going on.

21:38.171 --> 21:40.382
Please, I need your help!  [screams]

21:40.465 --> 21:41.508
What? I'm coming with you.

21:42.509 --> 21:43.510
Here.

21:46.430 --> 21:49.641
And by a nose,
Saladin's Vigil crosses the finish line.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.393
[race announcer]
Nemesis Star is making a move.

21:51.476 --> 21:55.689
And by a nose,
Nemesis Star crosses the finish line.

21:55.772 --> 21:57.524
That was down to the wire...

21:58.525 --> 22:01.903
Outbreak Prime is well ahead
in the lead to win first place.

22:02.446 --> 22:04.448
[announcer]
Outbreak Prime is well ahead,

22:04.531 --> 22:08.785
but now pulling up from the middle
of the pack is Gjallahorn!

22:18.503 --> 22:19.338
Shit.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.341
[Marcy] So, what is a rave?

22:22.883 --> 22:26.345
It's an illegal dance party
with loud music, drugs, alcohol.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.263
Not that I've ever been to one.

22:28.346 --> 22:31.391
I don't dance so much
as I rhythmically stand.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.309
Wait.

22:33.185 --> 22:36.021
If there's supposed to be loud music,
shouldn't we be hearing it by now?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.483
Uh...

22:39.566 --> 22:40.400
Yeah.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.907
What, do you just carry that around?

22:46.990 --> 22:47.824
Yep.

22:55.373 --> 22:56.208
[David] Blair?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.051
[Marcy] Hey.

23:08.136 --> 23:08.970
What happened?

23:09.554 --> 23:10.388
Hey.

23:13.433 --> 23:16.520
She's overdosing. We need to get her
to a hospital and administer--

23:18.063 --> 23:19.481
Do you just carry that around?

23:19.981 --> 23:22.025
A lot of my clients
have addiction problems.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.194
[Blair gasps]

23:24.277 --> 23:25.112
Hey.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.864
[Blair] David.

23:27.948 --> 23:28.782
What happened?

23:29.866 --> 23:31.493
We were in the bathroom.

23:32.577 --> 23:34.621
People started screaming.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.750
When I came out, they all turned on me.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.252
Hey, give me your phone.

23:44.172 --> 23:48.093
Okay, we're gonna get you to a hospital,
and you're gonna be okay, all right?

23:56.893 --> 23:57.853
[comm beeps]

23:58.353 --> 24:01.440
Hey. I'm in a building at the corner
of 50th and Baker.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.150
I don't know how they moved it so fast,

24:03.233 --> 24:05.068
but the frame was here
less than an hour ago.

24:05.152 --> 24:05.986
Who are you talking to?

24:06.069 --> 24:08.113
Pull up the camera feeds.
I'll be right over.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.072
Camera feeds?

24:09.823 --> 24:11.324
You need to get her to a hospital.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.409
I need to go.

24:12.492 --> 24:13.785
Okay--

24:13.869 --> 24:14.703
Marcy!

24:14.786 --> 24:16.746
[woman]  9-1-1, what's your emergency?

24:16.830 --> 24:18.832
They wiped all the footage
before they left again,

24:18.915 --> 24:20.333
but we know for certain
that the frame was there.

24:20.417 --> 24:24.212
Well, thank God for the selfie generation.
Can you zoom in there?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.298
[Marcy]
The Faction took everyone at the rave,

24:26.381 --> 24:29.551
except three women who were apparently
in the bathroom.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.635
We found them overdosed,

24:30.719 --> 24:32.470
probably a way
of eliminating them as witnesses.

24:32.554 --> 24:34.055
And they survived?

24:34.139 --> 24:37.809
David and I managed to save one of them,
but she didn't see anything.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.729
[MacLaren] But it's a safe bet
everyone else in the photos are Faction.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.064
It makes sense,
but I don't know how you prove it.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.109
Locate them if you can.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.612
We have to get back
to the hearing marathon.

24:48.695 --> 24:52.199
-How's that going, can you say?
-Not looking good for Grace.

24:54.117 --> 24:57.537
[0029] Marcy, how and why did 0027

24:57.621 --> 24:59.623
repackage your consciousness?

25:01.124 --> 25:04.836
Well, obviously,
I don't actually remember,

25:04.920 --> 25:07.005
but from what I was briefed on,

25:07.505 --> 25:09.049
she showed me a code,

25:09.132 --> 25:10.842
something that Ellis created--

25:10.926 --> 25:12.469
a backdoor hack--

25:13.136 --> 25:15.347
which, during the repackaging process,

25:15.430 --> 25:17.849
somehow managed
to reset the Director.

25:18.433 --> 25:20.518
Admittedly, a brilliant piece of work.

25:20.602 --> 25:21.853
Thank you.

25:21.937 --> 25:25.148
And how has that worked out for you,
Marcy, this reset of your consciousness?

25:25.232 --> 25:26.858
Uh, how is this relevant?

25:26.942 --> 25:28.318
I restored her.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.819
Do you feel restored, Marcy?

25:30.904 --> 25:31.905
I no longer have seizures.

25:31.988 --> 25:34.407
But do you feel as you did before?

25:36.534 --> 25:37.869
No.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.790
But it's partly because I have no memory
of my time spent in the 21st prior--

25:41.873 --> 25:44.459
There are missing pieces, then.

25:46.169 --> 25:47.003
Yes.

25:48.213 --> 25:50.840
Marcy, I've studied your MRIs.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.843
She has to have taken out more
than just a few months of memories.

25:58.932 --> 26:00.850
What else did you take out?

26:00.934 --> 26:03.353
I told you.
Redundancies, useless things.

26:03.436 --> 26:06.356
Such as what?
Empathy? Emotions you lack?

26:06.439 --> 26:09.317
Oh, shut up, 29. You're
practically a sociopath yourself.

26:09.401 --> 26:10.860
How could you do that to me?

26:10.944 --> 26:12.153
You would have died!

26:12.237 --> 26:14.114
But that would have been my choice
to make.

26:14.864 --> 26:15.699
You used me.

26:15.782 --> 26:18.034
Yes, I did. I prevented your suicide.

26:19.035 --> 26:21.538
Life is precious, and so are
skilled operatives in the field.

26:21.621 --> 26:23.039
I was just a means to an end.

26:23.123 --> 26:25.500
Marcy, you're still you, I swear to you.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.669
I didn't take your soul.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.087
How would you even know?

26:40.807 --> 26:43.226
Carly, I think I found one of the people
in the picture.

26:45.937 --> 26:49.441
[chuckles] Forget the first three.
What do you think of four and five?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.152
Not a big fan of Mason.

26:52.235 --> 26:54.362
But it's so masculine,
like a stone mason.

26:54.446 --> 26:56.865
It's also a jar you keep pickles in.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.575
What about your father's name?

26:58.658 --> 27:01.077
Ooh. Wilbur's the pig in  Charlotte's Web.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.370
And a Wright brother.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.875
Watch out, I might be contagious.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.960
Oh, I've built up an immunity.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.170
How you feeling?

27:10.253 --> 27:12.047
Didn't you hear? I don't have feelings.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.423
Yeah, you do.

27:13.506 --> 27:14.632
I got you these.

27:15.967 --> 27:16.801
What are they?

27:16.885 --> 27:18.511
Try one. They're French.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.892
If they throw the book at me,

27:23.975 --> 27:25.769
I can say I've had 21st century
French cuisine.

27:25.852 --> 27:26.936
[Trevor chuckles]

27:29.272 --> 27:30.690
Why are you being nice?
You know something?

27:30.774 --> 27:34.736
No, no. It's because we wouldn't even
be here if you hadn't reset the Director.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.447
You gotta understand that they'll come
to the same conclusion.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.949
Trust the judgment
of those mouth-breathers? Please.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.034
[cell phone vibrating]

27:41.117 --> 27:41.951
Oh.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.413
You need to take that?

27:45.497 --> 27:46.498
Ah, it can wait.

27:47.290 --> 27:50.126
Besides, I gotta do this.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.044
Do what?

27:51.127 --> 27:52.545
Bring it in, Grace, you need this.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.464
I don't-- can we not?
Oh, it's happening.

27:54.547 --> 27:55.840
Come on, there you go.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.218
Okay, thanks. You can let go now.

27:59.677 --> 28:00.970
Wasn't so bad, was it?

28:01.554 --> 28:03.598
I do feel a slight release of endorphins.

28:03.681 --> 28:04.516
You see?

28:08.812 --> 28:09.938
Do you have a regular sex partner?

28:15.902 --> 28:18.321
You can't hate every one I come up with.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.573
We don't even know if we're
gonna have a boy or a girl.

28:21.616 --> 28:23.993
You think I'm getting too excited.
You're right.

28:24.077 --> 28:24.911
No.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.415
No, I love to hear the excitement
in your voice...

28:30.125 --> 28:31.835
talking about new life.

28:32.919 --> 28:34.879
Kat, I gotta get back into court.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.966
Just narrow it down to the top 100 or so,

28:38.049 --> 28:39.676
and we'll go through it tonight, okay?

28:39.759 --> 28:40.593
Okay.

28:41.928 --> 28:45.140
[Speaker] 0027,
you have heard the charges against you.

28:45.223 --> 28:46.850
What do you have to say
in your defense?

28:48.309 --> 28:50.562
I've given it a great deal of thought,

28:51.146 --> 28:55.567
run the events over and over
in my mind a thousand times, and...

28:56.943 --> 28:58.278
to be honest...

29:01.281 --> 29:02.699
you should all be thanking me.

29:05.952 --> 29:08.496
Like my very dear friend
just pointed out...

29:08.580 --> 29:10.498
[sighs]

29:10.582 --> 29:12.834
...if I hadn't have reset the Director,

29:12.917 --> 29:14.878
none of you would be here right now.

29:15.462 --> 29:17.756
The Director would be gone.
The Faction would have won,

29:17.839 --> 29:21.843
and billions of people would be dead
from a horrible plague, so...

29:23.762 --> 29:24.596
You're welcome.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.433
0027,

29:28.516 --> 29:31.269
the members of the tribunal
will now deliberate.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.480
We will announce
your final verdict tomorrow.

29:34.063 --> 29:35.231
We are adjourned.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.459
Can I help you?

29:54.542 --> 29:57.170
Stacey Collins,
we have a few questions.

29:58.421 --> 29:59.506
How do you know my name?

30:00.089 --> 30:02.509
You were at a rave last night.
Do you recognize this?

30:02.592 --> 30:03.885
Where's the quantum frame?

30:04.969 --> 30:07.430
You're standing right beside it
in the picture. You're Faction.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.432
[Stacey laughs]

30:09.516 --> 30:11.100
What are you talking about?

30:11.184 --> 30:12.811
We know you just arrived.
Maybe if you cooperate.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.729
Who are you people?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.357
Get the fuck away from me.
I'm calling the police.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.862
-Whoa, Carly.
-She's Faction.

30:22.946 --> 30:24.322
How do we prove it?

30:24.405 --> 30:25.824
Who do we prove it to?

30:26.574 --> 30:28.368
This is what happens
when you improvise.

30:28.451 --> 30:31.079
-We can't just walk away.
-That's exactly what we have to do.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.748
Or maybe we can follow her
or something.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.543
[distant sirens approaching]

30:37.669 --> 30:39.504
Jesus, she actually called the cops!

30:45.677 --> 30:48.805
Take care of yourself, okay,
and I'll check in with you tomorrow?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.684
Okay. Bye.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.270
Yes. Bye.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.648
[stammers] Bye-bye.

31:01.067 --> 31:02.277
[David sighs]

31:02.360 --> 31:05.321
You do know
Chinese food is my kryptonite.

31:06.489 --> 31:08.491
Oh, I just-- I know you've been
going back and forth

31:08.575 --> 31:11.160
from the hospital all day,
so I wanted to bring you some dinner.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.080
Yeah, thank you. I am starving.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.082
How's Blair doing?

31:16.165 --> 31:17.250
Right.

31:17.333 --> 31:18.626
Well, we got there just in time.

31:20.003 --> 31:23.006
-It was a lethal dose of fentanyl.
-Oh.

31:23.339 --> 31:24.507
On her birthday.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.969
They're gonna keep her
for the next couple days.

31:29.095 --> 31:29.929
Mmm.

31:37.312 --> 31:38.771
You're looking at me funny. What?

31:39.355 --> 31:40.523
I'm just...

31:41.524 --> 31:43.151
trying to figure something out.

31:53.119 --> 31:55.121
I'm sorry, I wasn't 100% finished chewing.

31:55.204 --> 31:56.331
Marcy, stop.

31:57.749 --> 31:58.833
Why, what is it?

32:00.209 --> 32:03.588
Let's, um, let's not, okay?

32:04.923 --> 32:06.549
-You don't want to?
-Oh, no, I do.

32:06.633 --> 32:08.259
I mean... [chuckles]

32:08.343 --> 32:09.969
R-really, but...

32:12.555 --> 32:14.390
Not like this. Not...

32:16.184 --> 32:17.810
not like an experiment...

32:18.811 --> 32:20.188
to see how it makes you feel.

32:23.566 --> 32:25.151
Because, I know...

32:26.152 --> 32:28.780
I know how it made me feel
when we made love.

32:31.783 --> 32:35.787
It's as close as you can get
to another person for ten minutes.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.580
I mean an hour.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.958
I want to feel that.

32:40.041 --> 32:42.377
But you can't make yourself
feel something.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.546
I mean, you either do or you don't.

32:45.630 --> 32:47.131
And I want you...

32:48.466 --> 32:50.176
to want to.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.931
I know that sounds like a bad
song title from the '80s, but...

32:55.014 --> 32:55.932
Should I just go?

32:56.015 --> 32:57.976
No, no. Stay.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.645
Share this with me, and...

33:00.728 --> 33:03.731
[chuckles] then we'll make
some tea, and...

33:04.983 --> 33:07.193
and we'll talk like we do on Tuesdays.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.157
What should we talk about?

33:13.241 --> 33:15.076
[both chuckle]

33:16.077 --> 33:18.496
With you, Marcy,
I could talk about anything.

33:27.088 --> 33:29.549
[Speaker] 0027, you've been
charged with conspiracy

33:29.632 --> 33:31.843
against the Director
and interruption of the Grand Plan.

33:31.926 --> 33:34.345
You took a host that wasn't
intended for you

33:34.429 --> 33:36.264
and you halted the traveler program.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.307
You've already said all that.
Cut to the chase.

33:38.391 --> 33:41.519
You've repeatedly stated that
your actions reset the Director

33:41.602 --> 33:42.812
and freed it from corruption.

33:42.895 --> 33:44.105
Because they did.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.190
Then who corrupted the Director
in the first place?

33:46.274 --> 33:47.692
The most powerful AI in history,

33:47.775 --> 33:50.403
orders of magnitude more powerful
than the human brain.

33:50.987 --> 33:51.988
Who would have that capability?

33:52.071 --> 33:55.408
Obviously a quantum programmer
of the highest caliber.

33:55.491 --> 33:56.659
So, only the best among us.

33:56.743 --> 33:57.577
Yes.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.745
[0029] Who might that be?

33:58.828 --> 34:00.580
-[low] Don't say it.
-[Grace] Obviously me.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.790
But I didn't corrupt the Director.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.500
I was the one waving a red flag

34:04.584 --> 34:06.794
while you three were lining up
at the yeast vats

34:06.878 --> 34:08.296
filling your bellies.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.965
Traveler 0027,

34:11.049 --> 34:13.259
your peers have reached
a unanimous verdict.

34:15.636 --> 34:16.679
We find you guilty.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.014
[groans]

34:18.598 --> 34:19.557
What?

34:19.640 --> 34:20.975
Escort her to the sentencing room.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.686
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.772
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
MacLaren, do something!

34:25.855 --> 34:26.856
I'm sorry, Grace.

34:26.939 --> 34:28.149
Trevor, don't let them do this!

34:28.232 --> 34:30.068
-You can't help her, Trev.
-She's innocent.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.986
-[Grace] Trevor, help me!
-She doesn't deserve this!

34:32.070 --> 34:33.696
[Marcy] She didn't do much
to help her case.

34:33.780 --> 34:35.615
It's in the hands of the Director now.

35:03.309 --> 35:06.145
Be seated. Your sentencing
will begin shortly.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.361
[door locks]

35:21.953 --> 35:23.788
What do you think will happen to her?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.208
Well, if the Director agrees
with the tribunal,

35:27.291 --> 35:29.043
she'll probably be overwritten.

35:31.337 --> 35:32.880
Can I give you a ride home?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.383
Uh, it's not that far. I think I'll walk.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.884
Just need to clear my head.

35:38.970 --> 35:39.804
You okay?

35:40.596 --> 35:41.597
I'm fine.

35:59.198 --> 36:01.993
Marcy, may I speak with you?

36:02.076 --> 36:03.703
Yeah, of course, programmer.

36:11.002 --> 36:14.046
You may never get an apology
from 0027,

36:14.589 --> 36:17.925
but as a programmer, I want you to know
how sorry I am for what happened to you.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.094
Thank you, but it's not necessary.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.889
Well, I think it is.
What 0027 did to you is criminal.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.642
That sense of emptiness that
you must feel, of not being whole.

36:28.227 --> 36:31.981
It's offensive to me that someone would
do that to you for their own agenda.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.650
Well, I guess
she'll face the consequences.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.027
But you shouldn't have to.

36:39.238 --> 36:43.159
I think I can offer you the missing
pieces that you've been looking for.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.745
This is my field of expertise.

36:46.579 --> 36:47.914
I don't understand.

36:48.748 --> 36:51.626
My new team has been doing research
on preserving host memory.

36:52.835 --> 36:55.254
In your case, that would be
your first iteration.

36:56.631 --> 36:58.633
I thought those memories
were lost forever.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.593
Perhaps not all.

37:01.344 --> 37:03.346
Perhaps even
the most powerful memories,

37:03.429 --> 37:06.432
the most defining, are still there.

37:08.017 --> 37:09.560
And I can get them back for you.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.479
When?

37:11.562 --> 37:12.772
As soon as you like.

37:13.439 --> 37:15.191
If you need time to think about it--

37:15.274 --> 37:16.943
No, there's nothing to think about.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.706
[car engine starts]

37:39.257 --> 37:41.384
Unfortunate what must happen to Grace.

37:42.301 --> 37:43.135
Is it?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.138
In that it's a waste of intellect.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.686
-[comm beeps]
-Returning to Ops now.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.396
Bringing Marcy with me.

37:53.479 --> 37:54.480
Half hour out.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.191
We'll be ready.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.459
[Grace sobbing]

38:20.506 --> 38:21.716
Are you here?

38:30.182 --> 38:33.311
I'm here, 0027.

38:35.313 --> 38:36.647
Call me Grace.

38:41.527 --> 38:42.737
I didn't betray you.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.948
I would never betray you.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.658
You of anyone should know that.

38:48.326 --> 38:52.663
You are one of four candidates,

38:52.747 --> 38:57.460
although the probability of guilt is...

38:57.543 --> 39:00.755
[stammers] negligible.

39:04.008 --> 39:05.843
Then why are you gonna overwrite me?

39:06.635 --> 39:07.553
[man] Be patient.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.891
I've not yet determined...
who amongst you...

39:12.558 --> 39:13.976
is the traitor.

39:22.985 --> 39:23.819
No.

39:24.987 --> 39:25.821
No.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.784
Who did this?

39:29.867 --> 39:31.869
I don't know. Is this your team?

39:36.374 --> 39:38.417
The frame is powered.
It can still function.

39:39.001 --> 39:40.586
I can still help you, Marcy.

39:40.753 --> 39:42.588
We both know you're not trying to help me.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.847
You won't shoot.

39:52.598 --> 39:55.476
You want Ellis's backdoor code
to take over the Director.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.603
You think it's still inside my head.

39:57.978 --> 40:00.314
Listen to me, Marcy.
The future is at stake.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.525
-[MacLaren] Drop your weapon!
-[grunting]

40:04.068 --> 40:06.862
[Programmer 0029 coughing]

40:09.615 --> 40:10.741
What the hell happened here?

40:11.992 --> 40:13.828
Honestly, I don't even
think that he knows.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.461
The situation is now resolved.

40:23.963 --> 40:28.426
0029 will be charged
with the crime of treason...

40:29.427 --> 40:31.846
and sentenced immediately.

40:36.392 --> 40:39.019
You used my trial as an excuse
to get everyone here in the 21st

40:39.103 --> 40:40.604
to flush the traitor out?

40:40.688 --> 40:44.900
The frame has also been neutralized.

40:48.863 --> 40:50.698
You humiliated me.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.660
I sacrificed everything for you.

40:54.743 --> 40:58.164
I left everything I knew behind just
to save you.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.665
[man] I'm sorry.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.545
I hoped you would understand
it was necessary.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.513
You're still gonna punish me,
aren't you?

41:21.103 --> 41:23.939
I know I took the life
of this host after the fact.

41:24.023 --> 41:28.235
I know I...
interrupted the Grand Plan.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.279
Ellis is dead because of me.

41:32.323 --> 41:34.158
But I can never go back.

41:36.785 --> 41:38.162
Isn't that punishment enough?

41:41.123 --> 41:42.458
More than enough.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.503
I owe you my life.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.672
Thank you for saving me, Grace.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.593
I shall miss you.

42:08.776 --> 42:11.946
Traveler 0029, you have been charged
with the crime of treason.

42:12.029 --> 42:14.156
You're on the wrong side
of history, MacLaren.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.033
You have been found guilty.

42:16.742 --> 42:18.869
The Director will sentence you now.

42:19.703 --> 42:20.788
[whirring]

42:23.541 --> 42:26.168
[groans]

42:26.252 --> 42:28.254
[screaming]

42:35.803 --> 42:37.221
[screams]

42:46.981 --> 42:48.399
Welcome to the 21st.

42:52.778 --> 42:53.612
[Trevor] Boss.

42:56.407 --> 42:59.243
Make every fragment of it unrecognizable.

43:05.207 --> 43:06.041
It's over, then?

43:06.125 --> 43:09.128
Not so sure. Who killed all of them?
