Whoo-hoo!

00:45.543 --> 00:48.013
Whoo-hoo!

00:59.625 --> 01:01.892
Greetings, Pup Scouts.

01:01.894 --> 01:03.993
Hey, General Hot Dog.

01:03.995 --> 01:06.495
Hey, General Hot Dog.

01:06.497 --> 01:08.864
Piper, Boobear,
it's time for

01:08.866 --> 01:11.567
the annual Pup Scouts
of the World contest,

01:11.569 --> 01:13.603
where teams compete
for the chance to win

01:13.605 --> 01:16.840
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

01:16.842 --> 01:20.977
and all the bones
you can eat for a year.

01:22.613 --> 01:25.448
Your job is to chase,
fetch and report

01:25.450 --> 01:27.951
all there is
to know about

01:27.953 --> 01:29.785
dogs, puppies,

01:29.787 --> 01:32.022
and everything in between.

01:32.024 --> 01:35.124
You will travel
all over the world,

01:35.126 --> 01:38.561
across time,
space and beyond.

01:38.563 --> 01:40.996
You must keep your nose
to the wind,

01:40.998 --> 01:42.966
your ears perked,

01:42.968 --> 01:46.870
and your paws to the wheel
at all times.

01:46.872 --> 01:51.707
We depend on you to do
the best job possible.

01:51.709 --> 01:54.543
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

01:54.545 --> 01:57.713
Tail wiggling.

01:57.715 --> 02:00.183
Ears flappin'.

02:00.185 --> 02:03.587
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

02:03.589 --> 02:05.522
This is sure to be

02:05.524 --> 02:08.758
a challenging mission,
little ones.

02:08.759 --> 02:10.993
Succulent wishbones!

02:10.995 --> 02:13.529
I love challenging missions.

02:13.531 --> 02:16.999
Slappin' tails, me too!

02:17.001 --> 02:18.767
I'm sending you two

02:18.769 --> 02:23.240
on a mission
to learn about

02:23.242 --> 02:26.575
the evolution of dogs!

02:26.577 --> 02:28.545
The evolution of dogs?

02:28.547 --> 02:31.146
- How cool!
- Can't wait!

02:31.148 --> 02:34.283
It's up to you to learn

02:34.285 --> 02:38.521
all about it, and report back to
me with what you've discovered.

02:38.523 --> 02:40.757
Sweet barbecue sauce!

02:40.759 --> 02:44.093
This is going to be
an incredible adventure!

02:44.095 --> 02:47.963
What can you tell us about
evolution, General Hot Dog?

02:47.965 --> 02:49.932
Evolution is the process

02:49.934 --> 02:54.136
that allows an organism
to develop and diversify

02:54.138 --> 02:56.573
from earlier life forms.

02:56.575 --> 02:59.842
You see, us dogs have not always
looked like we do today.

02:59.844 --> 03:03.312
We have evolved over time.

03:03.314 --> 03:07.217
Wow! I can't wait
to find out more!

03:07.219 --> 03:10.886
The evolution of dogs
sounds so interesting!

03:10.888 --> 03:14.658
As you know,
Boobear and Piper,

03:14.660 --> 03:18.193
to win the annual
Pup Scouts of the World,

03:18.195 --> 03:22.032
you must find out
and learn tons

03:22.034 --> 03:24.668
of amazing facts
about dogs.

03:24.670 --> 03:26.068
We will.

03:26.070 --> 03:28.805
Awesome!

03:28.807 --> 03:31.241
You must also know
there is a question

03:31.243 --> 03:34.343
that all the brightest
canine minds

03:34.345 --> 03:39.015
all over the world
have not been able to answer

03:39.017 --> 03:41.818
about the evolution of dogs.

03:41.820 --> 03:45.588
We need you two Pup Scouts
to help us

03:45.590 --> 03:49.192
answer the
"what the woof" question

03:49.194 --> 03:50.894
about the evolution of dogs.

03:50.896 --> 03:54.063
"What the woof" question?

03:54.065 --> 03:57.166
How cool.
What is the question?

03:57.168 --> 04:00.170
What is the most
ancient breed of dogs

04:00.172 --> 04:02.237
in existence today?

04:02.239 --> 04:04.807
That's a great question,
General Hot Dog.

04:04.809 --> 04:07.377
Yes, General Hot Dog,

04:07.379 --> 04:11.213
we'll sniff out the answer
in the wag of a puppy's tail.

04:11.215 --> 04:12.382
You'll see.

04:12.384 --> 04:14.818
I will assign you
the best

04:14.820 --> 04:17.853
Pup Scout helper in the world:
Scuzzy Bot.

04:17.855 --> 04:21.624
He's a robotic encyclopedia
of canine knowledge.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.627
He will assist you
on your mission.

04:24.629 --> 04:26.663
Scuzzy Bot!

04:26.665 --> 04:29.132
We love Scuzzy Bot!

04:29.134 --> 04:32.769
Be sure to ask a lot
of questions, Pup Scouts.

04:32.771 --> 04:34.771
You have a prestigious

04:34.773 --> 04:37.374
Smartest Pooch award to win...

04:37.376 --> 04:40.776
and all the bones
you can eat for a year!

04:40.778 --> 04:44.346
Have an amazing adventure,
you two.

04:44.348 --> 04:46.315
All right!

04:46.317 --> 04:49.119
Pup Scouts...

04:49.121 --> 04:50.420
Hurray!

04:58.696 --> 05:00.430
Pup Scouts!

05:00.432 --> 05:02.298
Ready to get started
on your next adventure?

05:02.300 --> 05:03.899
Super ready.

05:03.901 --> 05:06.336
Is a Frisbee ready to fly?

05:06.338 --> 05:08.137
Remember, Pup Scouts,

05:08.139 --> 05:10.839
any and all questions you have,
I'm here to answer them.

05:10.841 --> 05:12.911
Where do we begin?

05:14.780 --> 05:17.447
Six million years ago,
the Earth's climate

05:17.449 --> 05:20.083
was getting
gradually colder.

05:20.085 --> 05:22.384
This is what eventually led
to the glaciations

05:22.386 --> 05:25.422
of the Pliocene
and the Pleistocene.

05:25.424 --> 05:29.059
This was also known
as the Ice Age.

05:29.061 --> 05:32.829
Sweet pork chops!
That's amazing!

05:32.831 --> 05:36.398
I'll be a kitty cat.
I didn't know that.

05:36.400 --> 05:38.468
Now, look down there.

05:38.470 --> 05:40.836
That's the southern part
of North America,

05:40.838 --> 05:43.740
today's southwestern
United States and Mexico,

05:43.742 --> 05:45.475
six million years ago.

05:45.477 --> 05:47.877
There is where
small woodland foxes

05:47.879 --> 05:50.213
<i>started getting
a lot larger and faster.</i>

05:50.215 --> 05:54.050
<i>By the late Miocene,
about five million years ago,</i>

05:54.052 --> 05:56.185
the first ancestors
of coyotes, wolves,

05:56.187 --> 05:57.886
and domestic dogs
had emerged.

05:57.888 --> 06:00.122
All members
of this family,

06:00.124 --> 06:03.358
which also includes modern-day
jackals, hyenas and foxes,

06:03.360 --> 06:05.795
are known as canids.

06:05.797 --> 06:08.098
Incredible!

06:08.100 --> 06:12.268
Hit my puppy brain with more
incredible facts, Scuzzy Bot.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.403
From America,
a group of canids

06:14.405 --> 06:16.773
made their way
into Europe and Asia.

06:16.775 --> 06:20.175
<i>The first canids were small-
to medium-sized meat eaters,</i>

06:20.177 --> 06:23.879
<i>but they were not the top
predators wolves are today.</i>

06:23.881 --> 06:25.882
But all that was about to change
with the emergence

06:25.884 --> 06:28.451
of a large creature
the size of a wolf

06:28.453 --> 06:31.887
around three to four
million years ago.

06:31.889 --> 06:34.023
Totally rip-tastic!

06:34.025 --> 06:37.226
Now, Boobear and Piper,
the mighty wolf as we know them today

06:37.228 --> 06:39.963
<i>didn't appear until
much later...</i>

06:39.965 --> 06:43.365
<i>800 thousand years ago,
in modern-day Alaska.</i>

06:43.367 --> 06:47.772
The time period is known
as the Middle Pleistocene.

06:48.939 --> 06:50.807
Amazing!

06:50.809 --> 06:54.144
Did dogs evolve
from wolves?

06:54.146 --> 06:56.045
Great question, Boobear.

06:56.047 --> 06:58.947
<i>The answer is yes.
And no.</i>

06:58.949 --> 07:01.250
<i>You see, Pup Scouts,
although dogs</i>

07:01.252 --> 07:04.386
<i>are of the same species
as modern wolves,</i>

07:04.388 --> 07:07.557
<i>they did not evolve
from the wolves you see today.</i>

07:07.559 --> 07:10.459
<i>It is believed
that dogs have evolved</i>

07:10.461 --> 07:13.829
from a wolf species
which is now extinct.

07:13.831 --> 07:16.165
Whoa!

07:16.167 --> 07:19.134
Cool factoid.
How did they know that?

07:19.136 --> 07:22.338
One way to learn about
evolution is to use DNA.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.374
What is DNA, Scuzzy Bot?

07:24.376 --> 07:27.377
DNA is short for...

07:27.379 --> 07:29.379
<i>deoxyribonucleic acid.</i>

07:29.381 --> 07:32.247
<i>I know.
It's a mouthful, isn't it?</i>

07:32.249 --> 07:34.184
<i>DNA is a thin molecule</i>

07:34.186 --> 07:37.319
<i>in the shape
of a winding curved ladder</i>

07:37.321 --> 07:39.189
<i>made up of nucleotides.</i>

07:39.191 --> 07:41.324
<i>Animal bodies
are made of cells,</i>

07:41.326 --> 07:45.495
<i>and DNA is a complicated
and pretty cool mechanism</i>

07:45.497 --> 07:48.264
<i>that tells cells
what to do.</i>

07:48.266 --> 07:51.033
In other words,
the cells of your body

07:51.035 --> 07:54.269
take orders from DNA,
just like young dogs

07:54.271 --> 07:58.040
take orders from
the alpha dog of the pack.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.343
Without the directions
of the alpha dog,

08:00.345 --> 08:02.444
younger dogs wouldn't
know how to behave.

08:02.446 --> 08:06.014
That's the same relationship
cells and DNA have.

08:06.016 --> 08:09.552
When did the first dogs
appear, Scuzzy Bot?

08:09.554 --> 08:11.553
Excellent question, Boobear.

08:11.555 --> 08:14.389
Dogs have separated
from their wolf ancestors

08:14.391 --> 08:17.192
<i>over 30,000 years ago.</i>

08:17.194 --> 08:20.230
<i>The earliest known fossil
of a domestic dog</i>

08:20.232 --> 08:23.432
is from 31,700 years ago

08:23.434 --> 08:26.903
and was found in
what is today's Belgium.

08:26.905 --> 08:29.372
So dogs
and modern-day wolves

08:29.374 --> 08:32.107
don't have anything
in common, Scuzzy Bot.

08:32.110 --> 08:34.509
Very good observation,
Boobear.

08:34.510 --> 08:37.312
Seems as if it would be so,
but it is not.

08:37.313 --> 08:39.916
There has been,
throughout time,

08:39.918 --> 08:42.118
mixing of dogs
with modern-day wolves.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.120
<i>So even if dogs
don't descend</i>

08:45.122 --> 08:47.090
<i>from modern-day wolves,</i>

08:47.092 --> 08:50.225
<i>they have mixed with them
in the very recent past.</i>

08:50.227 --> 08:53.528
<i>All this makes it
very difficult for scientists</i>

08:53.530 --> 08:57.200
to pinpoint the exact
origin of dogs.

08:57.202 --> 09:00.403
Can they tell us when dogs
become man's best friend?

09:00.405 --> 09:03.005
They can approximate
when that happened by using

09:03.007 --> 09:05.207
archeological evidence.

09:05.209 --> 09:08.510
Whoa! Archeological evidence?

09:08.512 --> 09:10.113
What is that?

09:10.115 --> 09:12.615
Archeology is
the study of the past

09:12.617 --> 09:14.517
based not on
written evidence,

09:14.519 --> 09:16.619
such as books
or ancient writing,

09:16.621 --> 09:18.587
but on physical evidence.

09:18.589 --> 09:20.523
Most of the archeological
evidence

09:20.525 --> 09:23.393
comes from
digging in the ground

09:23.395 --> 09:26.495
for ancient bones
or artifacts.

09:26.497 --> 09:29.197
Digging?
I'm an ace at digging,

09:29.199 --> 09:31.701
especially for
delicious bones!

09:31.703 --> 09:34.537
Follow me, Pup Scouts.
Let's head to the site

09:34.539 --> 09:37.240
where the first domesticated dog
was discovered.

09:37.242 --> 09:39.174
Whoo-hoo!

09:39.176 --> 09:41.277
Yay-hay-hay-hay!

09:41.279 --> 09:45.114
Here we are, Pup Scouts.
Below us is Germany.

09:45.116 --> 09:48.985
<i>It was here that the skeleton
of a domesticated dog was found.</i>

09:48.987 --> 09:51.653
<i>Its DNA identifies it as</i>

09:51.655 --> 09:54.090
<i>Canis lupus familiarus,</i>

09:54.092 --> 09:57.192
<i>which is the fancy name
for... dog!</i>

09:57.194 --> 09:59.062
<i>The remains date to around</i>

09:59.064 --> 10:02.565
13,000 to 14,000 years ago,

10:02.567 --> 10:06.469
and he was one of the earliest
examples of man's best friend.

10:06.471 --> 10:08.004
How do we know?

10:08.006 --> 10:10.005
We know because his skeleton

10:10.007 --> 10:12.374
was found in the same
burial site

10:12.376 --> 10:14.576
as a man and a woman,

10:14.578 --> 10:16.479
so he was a domesticated,

10:16.481 --> 10:19.448
and possibly well-loved
family dog.

10:19.450 --> 10:22.485
Where else were ancient dogs
found, Scuzzy Bot?

10:22.487 --> 10:26.221
Let's see. Uh, remains
of Canis lupus familiarus

10:26.223 --> 10:29.091
were found in Iraq, China,

10:29.093 --> 10:31.661
Siberia and Denmark.

10:31.663 --> 10:34.163
Were they all domesticated dogs?

10:34.165 --> 10:37.265
It's hard to tell
with all of them, although

10:37.267 --> 10:39.534
when dogs are found
in human burial grounds,

10:39.536 --> 10:42.205
<i>it's a good indication
that their lives</i>

10:42.207 --> 10:45.541
<i>and that of humans
have become very close.</i>

10:45.543 --> 10:48.076
<i>There are examples
in the Baikal region</i>

10:48.078 --> 10:51.313
<i>in modern-day Russia of dogs'
ceremonial burials.</i>

10:51.315 --> 10:53.115
<i>Archeologists have found dogs</i>

10:53.117 --> 10:56.085
buried lying
on their right side

10:56.087 --> 10:59.288
and facing towards the east,
just like humans.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.657
Some dogs were even
buried with artifacts,

11:01.659 --> 11:03.793
like stone
and bone carvings.

11:03.795 --> 11:08.096
Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit.
That's incredible!

11:08.098 --> 11:12.034
Did all those ancient dogs
look the same?

11:12.036 --> 11:14.269
That's a great question, Piper!

11:14.271 --> 11:17.506
The answer is,
probably not.

11:17.508 --> 11:21.210
There is evidence that multiple
breeds of primitive dogs existed.

11:21.212 --> 11:24.614
Many earlier forms of
domesticated dogs went extinct

11:24.616 --> 11:28.116
and were replaced by other
primitive dogs.

11:28.118 --> 11:31.620
All these dogs had different
coat lengths and color,

11:31.622 --> 11:34.157
and even their faces
and muzzles were different.

11:34.159 --> 11:38.628
Sweet barbecue bones!
I had no idea.

11:38.630 --> 11:41.364
What about breeds?
When did people begin to create

11:41.366 --> 11:43.732
all the dog breeds
we see today?

11:43.734 --> 11:45.768
Excellent question, Piper.

11:45.770 --> 11:48.504
I see you're paying
close attention.

11:48.506 --> 11:50.572
<i>The process of breeding dogs
to look like</i>

11:50.574 --> 11:53.842
<i>some of the breeds we see today
has been a long one,</i>

11:53.844 --> 11:56.611
<i>probably dating
back thousands of years</i>

11:56.613 --> 11:58.681
<i>since prehistoric times.</i>

11:58.683 --> 12:03.186
Why did people breed dogs to look
so different from each other?

12:03.188 --> 12:05.620
Normally, dogs are bred
to make sure certain traits

12:05.622 --> 12:08.658
that people like about them
are produced,

12:08.660 --> 12:11.394
like size, color,
temperament and shape.

12:11.396 --> 12:13.663
For example,
livestock guardian dogs

12:13.665 --> 12:17.133
were bred more than
2,000 years ago to protect

12:17.135 --> 12:20.536
flocks or herds of domesticated
animals, like sheep.

12:20.538 --> 12:23.572
Whoa!
Beagle brain blast!

12:23.574 --> 12:27.210
- That's incredible!
- I have a question.

12:27.212 --> 12:29.778
What's the most ancient
dog breed, Scuzzy Bot?

12:29.780 --> 12:34.583
It's believe the most ancient
dog breed in existence today

12:34.585 --> 12:37.486
is the New Guinea
Highland Wild Dog.

12:37.488 --> 12:39.522
They were believed
to have gone extinct,

12:39.524 --> 12:41.557
but a pack
of healthy and happy

12:41.559 --> 12:44.693
New Guinea highland wild dogs
have been discovered recently

12:44.695 --> 12:47.697
in the highest island
mountain peak in the world:

12:47.699 --> 12:51.200
the summit of Mount Carstensz
in New Guinea.

12:51.202 --> 12:53.302
Hey, Piper,

12:53.304 --> 12:56.304
I think we just found the answer
to General Hot Dog's

12:56.306 --> 12:59.142
"what the woof" question.

12:59.144 --> 13:01.376
You're right, Boobear.

13:01.378 --> 13:04.379
The most ancient dog breed
in existence today

13:04.381 --> 13:07.682
is the New Guinea
highland wild dog.

13:07.684 --> 13:10.519
Congratulations
on finding the answer

13:10.521 --> 13:13.322
to this mission's "what the
woof" question, Pup Scouts.

13:13.324 --> 13:15.390
General Hot Dog
will be proud of you.

13:15.392 --> 13:17.695
No bones about it.

13:21.933 --> 13:24.767
Fantastic work,
Pup Scouts.

13:24.769 --> 13:27.870
Your mission was
a great success.

13:27.872 --> 13:29.839
You're well on your way

13:29.841 --> 13:33.708
to winning the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

13:33.710 --> 13:36.312
and all the bones

13:36.314 --> 13:39.447
you can eat
for a year!

13:39.449 --> 13:41.817
Tail-waggin' awesome!

13:41.819 --> 13:46.188
Say, were you able to find
the answer to this mission's

13:46.190 --> 13:48.658
"what the woof" question?

13:48.660 --> 13:51.726
Yes, General Hot Dog.
We sure did.

13:51.728 --> 13:54.496
The most ancient dog breed
in existence today

13:54.498 --> 13:57.933
is the New Guinea
highland wild dog.

13:57.935 --> 14:00.302
They were believed
to have gone extinct,

14:00.304 --> 14:03.505
but a pack of New Guinea
highland wild dogs have been

14:03.507 --> 14:05.674
recently discovered.

14:05.676 --> 14:08.211
That's great! Ha!

14:08.213 --> 14:10.580
Good job, Pup Scouts!

14:10.582 --> 14:12.948
What's our next mission,
General Hot Dog?

14:12.950 --> 14:17.419
Your next mission is going to be
your most awesome yet.

14:17.421 --> 14:20.889
We want you to learn about...

14:20.891 --> 14:23.225
puppies!

14:23.227 --> 14:24.927
Puppies?

14:24.929 --> 14:27.263
Wow! Cool!

14:27.265 --> 14:29.764
I'll be a bacon strip!

14:29.766 --> 14:32.268
Can't wait to get started.

14:39.544 --> 14:40.909
Whoo-hoo!

14:40.911 --> 14:43.247
Whoo-hoo!

14:52.256 --> 14:54.490
Greetings, Pup Scouts.

14:54.492 --> 14:56.591
Hey, General Hot Dog.

14:56.593 --> 14:58.927
Hey, General Hot Dog.

14:58.929 --> 15:01.563
Piper, Boobear,
it's time for

15:01.565 --> 15:03.999
the annual Pup Scouts
of the World contest,

15:04.001 --> 15:06.302
where teams compete
for the chance to win

15:06.304 --> 15:09.471
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

15:09.473 --> 15:13.609
and all the bones
you can eat for a year.

15:15.045 --> 15:17.879
Your job is to chase,
fetch and report

15:17.881 --> 15:20.582
all there is
to know about

15:20.584 --> 15:22.418
dogs, puppies,

15:22.420 --> 15:24.653
and everything in between.

15:24.655 --> 15:27.756
You will travel
all over the world,

15:27.758 --> 15:30.993
across time,
space and beyond.

15:30.995 --> 15:33.629
You must keep your nose
to the wind,

15:33.631 --> 15:35.597
your ears perked,

15:35.599 --> 15:39.501
and your paws to the wheel
at all times.

15:39.503 --> 15:44.340
We depend on you to do
the best job possible.

15:44.342 --> 15:46.975
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

15:46.977 --> 15:50.346
Tail wiggling.

15:50.348 --> 15:52.748
Ears flappin'.

15:52.750 --> 15:55.951
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

15:55.953 --> 15:57.887
This is sure to be

15:57.889 --> 16:01.389
a challenging mission,
little ones.

16:01.391 --> 16:03.558
Succulent wishbones!

16:03.560 --> 16:05.927
I love challenging
missions.

16:05.929 --> 16:09.631
Slappin' tails,
me too!

16:09.633 --> 16:11.499
I'm sending you two

16:11.501 --> 16:13.735
on a mission to learn

16:13.737 --> 16:17.539
all about puppies!

16:17.541 --> 16:20.676
Puppies! How cool!

16:20.678 --> 16:22.077
Can't wait!

16:22.079 --> 16:25.413
It's up to you to learn
all about it

16:25.415 --> 16:29.118
and report back to me
with what you've discovered.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.620
That's cooler
than a cooled T-bone.

16:31.622 --> 16:35.023
This is going to be
an incredible adventure!

16:35.025 --> 16:38.793
What can you tell us about
puppies, General Hot Dog?

16:38.795 --> 16:40.562
Well, Piper,

16:40.564 --> 16:43.432
a puppy is
a juvenile dog.

16:43.434 --> 16:46.369
At birth,
puppies can weigh anywhere

16:46.371 --> 16:48.770
from less than a pound

16:48.772 --> 16:52.874
up to about 23 pounds
for larger breeds.

16:52.876 --> 16:56.111
Dogs give birth
to multiple offspring,

16:56.113 --> 16:58.847
and puppies are born
in groups

16:58.849 --> 17:01.884
of anywhere
from three to eight.

17:01.886 --> 17:05.453
They call these groups
of newborns "litters."

17:05.454 --> 17:07.923
Puppies also don't waste time,

17:07.925 --> 17:10.791
and they grow up fast.

17:10.794 --> 17:13.596
Other changes can also
occur as they grow,

17:13.598 --> 17:15.798
like changes
in fur color.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.499
Wow!

17:17.501 --> 17:20.102
I can't wait
to find out more!

17:20.104 --> 17:22.605
Puppies sound
so interesting.

17:22.607 --> 17:25.173
As you know,
Boobear and Piper,

17:25.175 --> 17:29.178
to win the annual
Pup Scouts of the World,

17:29.180 --> 17:32.114
you must find out
and learn tons

17:32.116 --> 17:34.115
of amazing facts
about dogs.

17:34.117 --> 17:36.719
Yes, General Hot Dog.

17:36.721 --> 17:38.953
We will.

17:38.955 --> 17:40.890
Awesome! Ha!

17:40.892 --> 17:44.192
You must also know
there is a question that

17:44.194 --> 17:48.431
all the brightest canine minds
all over the world

17:48.433 --> 17:51.767
have not been able to answer
about puppies.

17:51.769 --> 17:54.737
We need you two Pup Scouts
to help us

17:54.739 --> 17:58.941
answer the "what the woof"
question about puppies.

17:58.943 --> 18:02.478
"What the woof" question?
How cool!

18:02.480 --> 18:04.579
What is the question?

18:04.581 --> 18:06.781
I'm glad you asked, Piper.

18:06.783 --> 18:10.118
This time, the "what the woof"
question is,

18:10.120 --> 18:12.922
"What was the largest

18:12.924 --> 18:16.892
litter of puppies ever born?"

18:16.894 --> 18:19.862
That's a great question,
General Hot Dog.

18:19.864 --> 18:23.097
We'll sniff out the answer
in the wag of a puppy's tail.

18:23.099 --> 18:24.633
You'll see.

18:24.635 --> 18:26.801
I will assign you the best

18:26.803 --> 18:30.739
Pup Scout helper in the world:
Scuzzy Bot.

18:30.741 --> 18:34.242
He's a robotic encyclopedia
of canine knowledge.

18:34.244 --> 18:38.012
He will assist you
on your mission.

18:38.014 --> 18:40.516
Scuzzy Bot!

18:40.518 --> 18:42.550
We love Scuzzy Bot!

18:42.552 --> 18:45.520
Be sure to ask a lot
of questions, Pup Scouts.

18:45.522 --> 18:49.157
You have a prestigious
Smartest Pooch award to win,

18:49.159 --> 18:52.560
and all the bones

18:52.562 --> 18:55.530
you can eat for a year!

18:55.532 --> 18:58.834
Have an amazing adventure,
you two.

18:58.836 --> 19:00.169
All right!

19:00.171 --> 19:03.571
Pup Scouts...

19:03.573 --> 19:05.074
Hurray!

19:18.889 --> 19:22.991
Pup Scouts, ready to get started
on your next adventure?

19:22.993 --> 19:25.193
- Super ready!
- Ha, ha!

19:25.195 --> 19:27.663
Is a Frisbee
ready to fly?

19:27.665 --> 19:30.268
Remember, Pup Scouts,
any and all questions you have,

19:31.299 --> 19:33.635
- I'm here to answer them.
- Where do we begin?

19:33.637 --> 19:36.704
<i>Let's begin
with all the ways in which</i>

19:36.706 --> 19:40.209
<i>puppies are born
all over the world, shall we?</i>

19:40.211 --> 19:43.278
Down there is
the United States of America.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.713
Let's go check out
some puppies who live there.

19:45.715 --> 19:49.250
<i>Some puppies get lucky
and are born into good homes</i>

19:49.252 --> 19:52.788
<i>with families who are interested
in breeding their animals.</i>

19:52.790 --> 19:54.690
<i>This is one of the best ways</i>

19:54.692 --> 19:57.058
<i>to introduce a little puppy
into the world...</i>

19:57.060 --> 20:00.162
surrounded by loving people
and a support system

20:00.164 --> 20:02.830
for the big learning curve
that comes with being born.

20:02.832 --> 20:05.200
Puppies grow fast
and can achieve

20:05.202 --> 20:07.201
full-grown height
and weight

20:07.203 --> 20:09.771
in just a few weeks,
depending upon their breed.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.775
Sweet pork chops!
That's amazing!

20:12.777 --> 20:16.144
I'll be a kitty cat.
I didn't know that.

20:16.146 --> 20:19.882
Chances are good that most
puppies will be taken care of,

20:19.884 --> 20:21.951
as one in three
American households

20:21.953 --> 20:24.088
currently have
a dog or puppy.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.826
Cool!
Hit my pup brain

20:30.828 --> 20:33.596
with more totally cool
facts, Scuzzy Bot.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.330
Dogs gestate
in the womb

20:35.332 --> 20:37.932
at a much shorter rate
than human babies,

20:37.934 --> 20:40.035
and mommy dogs
carry their puppies

20:40.037 --> 20:43.905
for only about 60 days,
or two months, before they're born.

20:43.907 --> 20:46.342
Totally woof-tastic.

20:46.344 --> 20:49.010
I know, right?
And people who own dogs

20:49.012 --> 20:52.615
treat those animals like members
of the family, which they are.

20:52.617 --> 20:55.084
Seventy percent of dog owners
sign their pet's name

20:55.086 --> 20:57.720
on holiday cards
for friends and loved ones.

20:57.722 --> 20:59.721
Amazing!

20:59.723 --> 21:03.625
Do puppies also go to school,
just like a human family's can?

21:03.627 --> 21:05.961
<i>Great question, Boobear.</i>

21:05.963 --> 21:08.130
<i>While puppies don't
go to school for reading,</i>

21:08.132 --> 21:10.399
<i>writing or arithmetic,
like human children,</i>

21:10.401 --> 21:13.102
they sometimes go do go
to behavior training

21:13.104 --> 21:15.104
and housebreaking classes.

21:15.106 --> 21:17.806
So, yes, they kind of do
go to school.

21:17.808 --> 21:21.343
Whoa!
Cool factoid.

21:21.345 --> 21:24.413
So what is the best way
for a good family

21:24.415 --> 21:26.749
to find a puppy
that's right for them?

21:26.751 --> 21:29.384
There's more than one way
to do that, Piper.

21:29.386 --> 21:32.721
In fact, there's a wide
variety of ways,

21:32.723 --> 21:35.790
depending on the family,
the puppy, and the situation.

21:35.792 --> 21:37.726
Wow!

21:37.728 --> 21:39.994
Can you tell us some of these
ways, Scuzzy Bot?

21:39.996 --> 21:43.665
I sure can.
Unfortunately for puppies,

21:43.667 --> 21:47.368
the world currently has a real
homeless-animal problem,

21:47.370 --> 21:51.373
and homeless animals outnumber
homeless people five to one.

21:51.375 --> 21:53.942
That's a bad ratio.
But luckily,

21:53.944 --> 21:56.278
more people are animal lovers
than not,

21:56.280 --> 21:59.682
so many homeless puppies
find their way off the streets

21:59.684 --> 22:01.717
<i>and into good
and loving homes.</i>

22:01.719 --> 22:05.820
<i>Whoa, Scuzzy Bot.
They're very lucky.</i>

22:05.822 --> 22:08.222
I'm so happy these poor
little guys get a chance

22:08.224 --> 22:11.125
to meet their forever person,
who will love them.

22:11.127 --> 22:13.394
Totally.
How else can someone

22:13.396 --> 22:15.698
meet the puppy of their
dreams, Scuzzy Bot?

22:15.700 --> 22:17.865
Excellent question, Boobear.

22:17.867 --> 22:20.234
A person can also find
their perfect puppy

22:20.236 --> 22:23.105
through a variety
of reputable breeders,

22:23.107 --> 22:25.339
like the ones who are
endorsed by groups

22:25.341 --> 22:29.111
like the American Kennel Club or
the Westminster Kennel Dog Club.

22:29.113 --> 22:32.047
Wow! There are big organizations

22:32.049 --> 22:34.415
that care that much
about little puppies?

22:34.417 --> 22:37.452
That's amazing,
Scuzzy Bot!

22:37.454 --> 22:39.755
<i>Very good
observation, Boobear.</i>

22:39.757 --> 22:42.057
<i>There are actually
many organizations</i>

22:42.059 --> 22:45.928
<i>that focus on helping puppies
and animals of all kinds.</i>

22:45.930 --> 22:47.762
Really?
Who are they?

22:47.764 --> 22:50.132
The Humane Society
of the United States

22:50.134 --> 22:54.169
and Humane Society International
are just two who do a lot of good.

22:54.171 --> 22:56.505
Then there's People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals,

22:56.507 --> 22:59.307
Friends of Animals,
and Petfinder.

22:59.309 --> 23:01.410
The A.S.P.C.A.
is another one.

23:01.412 --> 23:03.912
It stands for
"The American Society

23:03.914 --> 23:06.315
for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals."

23:06.317 --> 23:09.351
Whoa! What types
of stuff do they do?

23:09.353 --> 23:12.320
They're a longtime leader
in rescue, adoption and welfare

23:12.322 --> 23:14.388
for puppies
and other animals

23:14.390 --> 23:17.291
who sometimes don't have people
who want to take care of them.

23:17.293 --> 23:19.294
I don't know who wouldn't
want to take care

23:19.296 --> 23:21.529
of a cute, cuddly
little puppy.

23:21.531 --> 23:23.798
Who wouldn't want
to do that?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.800
Good question, Boobear.

23:25.802 --> 23:28.936
The unfortunate truth is,
some people don't have the time,

23:28.938 --> 23:31.507
skills, or interest
in raising a puppy.

23:31.509 --> 23:34.876
<i>Puppies are a lot of work,
in case you don't know.</i>

23:34.878 --> 23:38.313
And luckily for them,
there are a lot more people

23:38.315 --> 23:41.817
<i>and organizations that do care
and want to help.</i>

23:41.819 --> 23:44.252
And I've got a surprise
for you guys.

23:44.254 --> 23:46.821
We're about to drop in
on some wonderful groups

23:46.823 --> 23:49.090
who do great jobs
training puppies

23:49.092 --> 23:51.192
to grow up big
and strong and good,

23:51.194 --> 23:53.895
and live long lives
with their people.

23:53.897 --> 23:56.967
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yay!

23:59.904 --> 24:03.806
Here we are, Pup Scouts...
puppy class 101.

24:03.808 --> 24:06.942
<i>This is just one place where
puppies learn the basics...</i>

24:06.944 --> 24:10.211
<i>basic training, if you will...
of behavior and communication.</i>

24:10.213 --> 24:14.115
Look at all the toys and the treats!
Where are we?

24:14.117 --> 24:17.219
<i>Welcome to a
dog-training center, Piper.</i>

24:17.221 --> 24:20.888
<i>Wow! What do they do here?</i>

24:20.890 --> 24:25.259
<i>Well, some places
offer grooming, training, boarding,</i>

24:25.261 --> 24:28.864
daycare and adoption services
for recent puppy parents.

24:28.866 --> 24:31.165
That sounds like
they cover it all.

24:31.167 --> 24:34.068
Pretty much, Piper.
Some of these places offer

24:34.070 --> 24:37.839
puppy and adult dog training
classes at affordable prices.

24:37.841 --> 24:40.142
They are run by
a staff of experts

24:40.144 --> 24:42.243
for interested
pet owners.

24:42.245 --> 24:44.346
After just a few classes,

24:44.348 --> 24:47.082
any wild and wooly puppy
can transform into

24:47.084 --> 24:50.551
a well-behaved and good-mannered
member of the family.

24:50.553 --> 24:54.088
Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit.
That's incredible!

24:54.090 --> 24:56.391
Exactly what kinds of things
do puppies learn

24:56.393 --> 24:58.861
in puppy schooling,
Scuzzy Bot?

24:58.863 --> 25:01.096
That's a great question,
Piper.

25:01.098 --> 25:03.365
Puppies learn everything
they need to join

25:03.367 --> 25:05.534
a human owner
or family's home,

25:05.536 --> 25:08.303
but also the basics
of how to behave

25:08.305 --> 25:11.240
and be good dogs
all by themselves.

25:11.242 --> 25:14.209
As we know, some of the biggest
issues with puppies

25:14.211 --> 25:16.979
<i>occur when they're
left alone.</i>

25:16.981 --> 25:19.981
<i>Hyperactivity, boredom,</i>

25:19.983 --> 25:22.284
<i>confusion and fear</i>

25:22.286 --> 25:26.255
<i>can lead to all kinds
of behavioral problems,</i>

25:26.257 --> 25:28.257
especially if the puppy
has access

25:28.259 --> 25:30.592
to delicate things
or breakables.

25:30.594 --> 25:34.596
Sweet barbecue bones!
I had no idea.

25:34.598 --> 25:38.366
Sounds like schooling can come
in handy in more ways than one.

25:38.368 --> 25:40.568
How long do puppy classes
usually last?

25:40.570 --> 25:43.137
Excellent question,
Piper.

25:43.139 --> 25:45.274
I see you're paying
close attention.

25:45.276 --> 25:48.076
It depends on the puppy,
but experts recommend

25:48.078 --> 25:50.511
keeping puppy training
sessions short...

25:50.513 --> 25:52.681
no more than 15 minutes,

25:52.683 --> 25:55.917
or even shorter, if the puppy
has a short attention span.

25:55.919 --> 25:57.920
If training runs too long,

25:57.922 --> 25:59.954
energetic puppies
stand a good chance

25:59.956 --> 26:02.324
of getting distracted
or bored,

26:02.326 --> 26:04.660
and that's when
most mistakes happen.

26:04.662 --> 26:08.462
How long do people train puppies
before the training takes effect

26:08.464 --> 26:11.967
and becomes their new behavior,
Scuzzy Bot?

26:11.969 --> 26:15.103
It usually takes
four to six months to train,

26:15.105 --> 26:18.006
but sometimes takes as long
as a year, Boobear.

26:18.008 --> 26:21.108
Whoa! Beagle brain blast!
That's incredible!

26:21.110 --> 26:23.077
<i>I have a question!</i>

26:23.079 --> 26:25.713
<i>If puppies are born in litters
of multiple numbers,</i>

26:25.715 --> 26:30.352
<i>that could make for a whole
class full of rowdy puppies.</i>

26:30.354 --> 26:34.990
What's the biggest litter of
puppies ever born, Scuzzy Bot?

26:34.992 --> 26:37.192
The biggest litter
of puppies

26:37.194 --> 26:40.429
ever born is 24,

26:40.431 --> 26:43.198
to a Neapolitan mastiff
named Tia

26:43.200 --> 26:47.068
on November 29, 2004,
in the United Kingdom.

26:47.070 --> 26:49.403
And Tia's full name is

26:49.405 --> 26:51.440
Abellatino Arabella.

26:51.442 --> 26:54.041
Hey, Piper, I think
we just found the answer

26:54.043 --> 26:56.744
to General Hot Dog's
"what the woof" question.

26:56.746 --> 27:00.115
You're right, Boobear.
The largest litter of puppies

27:00.117 --> 27:02.049
ever born is 24.

27:02.051 --> 27:04.618
Congratulations
on finding the answer

27:04.620 --> 27:08.022
to this mission's "what the
woof" question, Pup Scouts

27:08.024 --> 27:10.525
General Hot Dog
will be proud of you,

27:10.527 --> 27:12.597
no bones about it.

27:16.232 --> 27:18.733
Fantastic work,
Pup Scouts.

27:18.735 --> 27:21.502
Your mission was
a great success.

27:21.504 --> 27:23.438
You're well on your way
to winning

27:23.440 --> 27:26.274
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

27:26.276 --> 27:28.743
and all the bones

27:28.745 --> 27:31.179
you can eat
for a year!

27:31.181 --> 27:33.414
Tail-waggin' awesome!

27:33.416 --> 27:37.451
Say, were you able to find
the answer to this mission's

27:37.453 --> 27:40.021
"what the woof" question?

27:40.023 --> 27:42.524
Yes, General Hot Dog.
We sure did.

27:42.526 --> 27:47.128
The largest litter of
puppies ever born is 24,

27:47.130 --> 27:51.133
to Tia, a Neapolitan mastiff
in the U.K.

27:51.135 --> 27:54.435
They were born
on November 29, 2004,

27:54.437 --> 27:58.373
and Tia's full name is
Abellatino Arabella.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.275
That's great!

28:00.277 --> 28:02.544
Good job, Pup Scouts.

28:02.546 --> 28:05.279
Your next mission
is going to be

28:05.281 --> 28:07.649
your most awesome yet.

28:07.651 --> 28:09.718
We want you
to learn about

28:09.720 --> 28:12.721
how dogs help man.

28:12.723 --> 28:15.323
How dogs help man?

28:15.325 --> 28:17.558
Wow! Cool!

28:17.560 --> 28:19.594
I'll be a bacon strip!

28:19.596 --> 28:21.462
Can't wait
to get started.

28:21.464 --> 28:24.132
Ears flappin'!

28:24.134 --> 28:27.372
Tail wiggling.

28:33.409 --> 28:35.242
Whoo-hoo!

28:35.244 --> 28:37.614
Whoo-hoo!

28:44.221 --> 28:47.122
Greetings, Pup Scouts.

28:47.124 --> 28:49.124
Hey, General Hot Dog.

28:49.126 --> 28:51.159
Hey, General Hot Dog.

28:51.161 --> 28:54.162
Piper, Boobear,
it's time for

28:54.164 --> 28:57.268
the annual Pup Scouts
of the World contest,

28:58.299 --> 28:59.835
where teams compete
for the chance to win

28:59.837 --> 29:04.239
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

29:04.241 --> 29:06.641
and all the bones

29:06.643 --> 29:09.277
you can eat for a year.

29:09.279 --> 29:12.279
Your job is to chase,
fetch and report

29:12.281 --> 29:14.849
all there is
to know about

29:14.851 --> 29:16.550
dogs, puppies,

29:16.552 --> 29:19.221
and everything in between.

29:19.223 --> 29:22.857
You will travel
all over the world,

29:22.859 --> 29:26.627
across time,
space and beyond.

29:26.629 --> 29:29.330
You must keep your nose
to the wind,

29:29.332 --> 29:31.165
your ears perked,

29:31.167 --> 29:35.336
and your paws to the wheel
at all times.

29:35.338 --> 29:38.906
We depend on you to do
the best job possible.

29:38.908 --> 29:41.742
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

29:41.744 --> 29:44.613
Tail wiggling.

29:44.615 --> 29:46.847
Ears flappin'.

29:46.849 --> 29:50.384
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

29:50.386 --> 29:51.920
All right!

29:51.922 --> 29:53.888
This is sure to be

29:53.890 --> 29:56.258
a challenging mission,
little ones.

29:56.260 --> 29:59.560
Succulent wishbones!
I love challenging missions.

29:59.562 --> 30:02.163
Slappin' tails,
me too!

30:02.165 --> 30:03.832
I'm sending you two

30:03.834 --> 30:06.667
on a mission
to learn about

30:06.669 --> 30:09.637
how dogs help man.

30:09.639 --> 30:12.840
How dogs help man.
How cool!

30:12.842 --> 30:14.576
Can't wait.

30:14.578 --> 30:18.212
It's up to you learn
all about it

30:18.214 --> 30:21.215
and report back to me
with what you've discovered.

30:21.217 --> 30:23.617
Sweet barbecue sauce!

30:23.619 --> 30:27.288
This is going to be
an incredible adventure!

30:27.290 --> 30:31.192
What can you tell us about how
dogs help man, General Hot Dog?

30:31.194 --> 30:35.529
Dogs are the first domesticated
species in history,

30:35.531 --> 30:39.267
and they've been purposely bred
over the centuries

30:39.269 --> 30:41.269
for various
desirable traits.

30:41.271 --> 30:45.906
Physical traits,
behavioral traits and sensory traits

30:45.908 --> 30:48.576
all endear dogs to humans

30:48.578 --> 30:51.212
and strengthen the bonds
between them,

30:51.214 --> 30:53.882
historically making
the dog valued,

30:53.884 --> 30:56.218
revered and loved.

30:56.220 --> 30:59.587
Wow! I can't wait
to find out more.

30:59.589 --> 31:02.824
How dogs help man...
sounds so interesting.

31:02.826 --> 31:05.594
As you know,
Boobear and Piper,

31:05.596 --> 31:08.630
to win the annual
Pup Scouts of the World,

31:08.632 --> 31:11.633
you must find out
and learn tons

31:11.635 --> 31:14.336
of amazing facts
about dogs.

31:14.338 --> 31:17.806
- Yes, General Hot Dog!
- We will!

31:17.808 --> 31:19.641
Awesome!

31:19.643 --> 31:22.876
You must also know
there is a question

31:22.878 --> 31:25.547
that all the brightest
canine minds

31:25.549 --> 31:29.317
all over the world
have not been able to answer

31:29.319 --> 31:32.586
about how dogs help man.

31:32.588 --> 31:35.557
We need you two Pup Scouts
to help us answer

31:35.559 --> 31:38.326
the "what the woof"
question

31:38.328 --> 31:41.796
about how dogs
help man.

31:41.798 --> 31:44.332
"What the woof" question."

31:44.334 --> 31:47.402
How cool.
What is the question?

31:47.404 --> 31:50.672
Well, for some time,
dogs have been used

31:50.674 --> 31:53.407
to aid man in medical areas.

31:53.409 --> 31:56.278
One of the most prominent
and helpful of these

31:56.280 --> 31:59.446
have been dogs that are
specifically trained

31:59.448 --> 32:02.349
to help the blind to see.

32:02.351 --> 32:05.920
Today's "what the woof"
question is this:

32:05.922 --> 32:09.057
"Who was history's very first

32:09.059 --> 32:11.026
Seeing Eye dog?"

32:11.028 --> 32:13.662
That's a great question,
General Hot Dog.

32:13.664 --> 32:17.798
We'll sniff out the answer in the
wag of a puppy's tail. You'll see.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.301
I will assign you
the best

32:20.303 --> 32:23.438
Pup Scout helper in the world:
Scuzzy Bot.

32:23.440 --> 32:27.942
He's a robotic encyclopedia
of canine knowledge.

32:27.944 --> 32:31.445
He will assist you
on your mission.

32:31.447 --> 32:33.381
Scuzzy Bot!

32:33.383 --> 32:35.349
We love Scuzzy Bot!

32:35.351 --> 32:39.586
Be sure to ask a lot
of questions, Pup Scouts.

32:39.588 --> 32:41.588
You have a prestigious

32:41.590 --> 32:44.358
Smartest Pooch award to win...

32:44.360 --> 32:48.563
and all the bones
you can eat for a year!

32:48.565 --> 32:51.900
Have an amazing adventure,
you two.

32:51.902 --> 32:53.468
All right!

32:53.470 --> 32:55.436
Pup Scouts...

32:55.438 --> 32:56.637
Hurray!

33:08.819 --> 33:10.617
Pup Scouts!

33:10.619 --> 33:12.721
Ready to get started
on your next adventure?

33:12.723 --> 33:14.955
Super ready.

33:14.957 --> 33:16.891
Is a Frisbee ready to fly?

33:16.893 --> 33:18.692
Remember, Pup Scouts,

33:18.694 --> 33:21.663
any and all questions you have,
I'm here to answer them.

33:21.665 --> 33:24.365
- Where do we begin?
- I'm glad you asked.

33:24.367 --> 33:27.836
<i>Let's begin with some of the most
feel-good stories we can find</i>

33:27.838 --> 33:32.073
<i>where dogs haven't only helped
humans, they've saved lives.</i>

33:32.075 --> 33:34.776
It's no secret that
dog and man form a bond

33:34.778 --> 33:39.047
as strong... and at times greater...
than people do with each other.

33:39.049 --> 33:41.715
Humans can sometimes be
complicated creatures,

33:41.717 --> 33:44.451
but dogs, not so much.

33:44.453 --> 33:47.588
With dogs, you always know
where you stand.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.923
The dog is a natural
companion animal,

33:49.925 --> 33:53.627
and if a dog likes you,
you'll be inseparable.

33:53.629 --> 33:57.432
Likewise, if a dog doesn't like
you, you'll know that too.

33:57.434 --> 33:59.834
Dogs wear their hearts
on their s...

33:59.836 --> 34:03.837
um... sleeves,
and in times of distress,

34:03.839 --> 34:07.674
it's not uncommon for dogs to risk
their lives for their human families.

34:07.676 --> 34:09.444
Incredible.

34:09.446 --> 34:12.045
My little puppy mind
is officially blown.

34:12.047 --> 34:15.014
I'll be a burger patty.
I didn't know that!

34:15.016 --> 34:18.018
Oh, it's true, Boobear.
It's all true.

34:18.021 --> 34:20.754
In emergencies,
natural disasters,

34:20.755 --> 34:23.857
or just instances
of plain, old trouble,

34:23.859 --> 34:27.562
dogs have come up big
for the people in their lives.

34:27.563 --> 34:30.165
<i>Let's take a look at some
downright heroic dogs</i>

34:30.167 --> 34:33.033
<i>and the amazing things
they've done to help man</i>

34:33.034 --> 34:35.502
<i>in times of need
or distress.</i>

34:35.504 --> 34:40.040
Incredible. Hit me with more super
facts, Scuzzy Bot.

34:40.042 --> 34:43.043
Life can be unpredictable

34:43.045 --> 34:46.679
and sometimes dangerous when
things happen beyond our control.

34:46.681 --> 34:48.616
Natural disasters like fire,

34:48.618 --> 34:51.185
floods and earthquakes
can't be controlled,

34:51.187 --> 34:53.719
<i>only dealt with
as best people can.</i>

34:53.722 --> 34:56.024
<i>And sometimes they need
a little extra help</i>

34:56.025 --> 34:59.026
<i>dealing with problems
that arise.</i>

34:59.028 --> 35:01.830
This is where dogs have come up
big over the years,

35:01.832 --> 35:03.698
alerting man to danger

35:03.700 --> 35:07.100
and even saving the lives
of their loved ones.

35:07.102 --> 35:09.571
Totally incredible!

35:09.573 --> 35:12.040
<i>Dogs have woken sleeping
people up to alert them to trouble,</i>

35:12.042 --> 35:15.509
<i>and in some really bad cases,
they've led man to safety.</i>

35:15.511 --> 35:19.247
<i>Without their dogs,
these people might have died.</i>

35:19.249 --> 35:23.484
<i>Amazing!
How do dogs possess the quality</i>

35:23.486 --> 35:27.120
<i>to lead people of of,
say, a burning building?</i>

35:27.122 --> 35:29.156
<i>Great question, Boobear.</i>

35:29.158 --> 35:31.258
<i>There are a few
different answers.</i>

35:31.260 --> 35:33.895
Dogs have better eyesight
than humans do,

35:33.897 --> 35:36.497
with large pupils
and a better ability

35:36.499 --> 35:38.933
<i>to process light,
or the lack thereof.</i>

35:38.935 --> 35:42.904
If it's dark, or if smoke from
a fire makes it hard to see,

35:42.906 --> 35:47.174
a wide-eyed dog
can come in real handy.

35:47.176 --> 35:49.544
Whoa. Cool factoid.

35:49.546 --> 35:51.845
What other super senses
do dogs have?

35:51.847 --> 35:53.781
I'm glad you asked, Piper.

35:53.783 --> 35:56.149
Along with their
exceptional eyesight,

35:56.151 --> 35:58.752
<i>dogs can also hear
much better than humans.</i>

35:58.754 --> 36:01.823
<i>With super sensitive ears,
dogs can register sounds</i>

36:01.825 --> 36:04.926
<i>way before man's
audio spectrum,</i>

36:04.928 --> 36:07.194
<i>and they have mobile ears</i>

36:07.196 --> 36:11.131
<i>that are able to pinpoint
the exact source of any sound</i>

36:11.133 --> 36:14.736
<i>by using an array of muscles
that lift, lower,</i>

36:14.738 --> 36:17.037
<i>tilt and pivot their ears.</i>

36:17.039 --> 36:19.908
And dogs are also able
to pick up sounds

36:19.910 --> 36:23.977
at four times the distance
that a human can.

36:23.979 --> 36:26.948
Sounds like dogs practically
have super powers.

36:26.950 --> 36:30.984
What other special senses do dogs
possess, Scuzzy Bot?

36:30.986 --> 36:34.154
A supercharged
sense of smell

36:34.156 --> 36:38.892
also helps dogs to do all
kinds of cool things, Boobear.

36:38.894 --> 36:41.930
<i>Smell receptors dominate
a dog's brain,</i>

36:41.932 --> 36:45.633
<i>much like visual receptors
dominate man's brain.</i>

36:45.635 --> 36:48.736
<i>Dogs have approximately
40 times</i>

36:48.738 --> 36:51.272
<i>more smell sensitivity
than humans do,</i>

36:51.274 --> 36:54.042
<i>allowing them to detect
a scent's direction</i>

36:54.044 --> 36:56.144
<i>and track its source.</i>

36:56.146 --> 36:59.113
<i>But how does
strength of smell allow a dog</i>

36:59.115 --> 37:02.015
<i>to track down the source
of that smell?</i>

37:02.017 --> 37:04.084
Excellent question,
Boobear.

37:04.086 --> 37:07.721
A dog's wet nose
allows it to detect

37:07.723 --> 37:11.625
the air breeze that contains
a particular scent.

37:11.627 --> 37:14.729
Does that explain
why so many lost dogs

37:14.731 --> 37:17.631
are able to find
their ways home, Scuzzy Bot?

37:17.633 --> 37:21.935
Very good observation, Boobear.
That's exactly why.

37:21.937 --> 37:25.238
If a dog gets out of its yard
and wanders its neighborhood,

37:25.240 --> 37:29.711
it can still use the scent
of home to find its way back,

37:29.713 --> 37:33.314
provided the dog hasn't roamed
so far that it loses that scent.

37:33.316 --> 37:37.185
<i>That's never fun, and usually
requires a good Samaritan</i>

37:37.187 --> 37:39.886
<i>to find and return
the dog to its owner.</i>

37:39.888 --> 37:42.390
<i>What about tracking
people, Scuzzy Bot?</i>

37:42.392 --> 37:44.691
<i>Do dogs ever do that?</i>

37:44.693 --> 37:47.328
<i>They sure do. Dogs track</i>

37:47.330 --> 37:49.830
<i>all kinds of people,
and things too.</i>

37:49.832 --> 37:53.167
<i>In the law-enforcement world,
dogs are often used</i>

37:53.169 --> 37:55.203
<i>to track down
escaped prisoners</i>

37:55.205 --> 37:58.105
<i>and return them to jail
to finish their sentences.</i>

37:58.107 --> 38:03.076
<i>Whoa!
Do dogs ever track good people too?</i>

38:03.078 --> 38:06.814
They do indeed, Piper.
They've tracked missing children,

38:06.816 --> 38:09.183
helped guide lost hikers
out of the woods,

38:09.185 --> 38:12.787
and even gotten medical help
for injured people.

38:12.789 --> 38:16.189
Dogs track everything,
all the time,

38:16.191 --> 38:18.692
for all kinds
of reasons.

38:18.694 --> 38:21.229
It's a skill
they don't really turn off.

38:21.231 --> 38:23.897
Like a basic instinct.

38:23.899 --> 38:26.968
- Or a super power.
- Absolutely.

38:26.970 --> 38:29.370
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yay!

38:29.372 --> 38:33.774
<i>Here we are, Pup Scouts.
Take a look around.</i>

38:33.776 --> 38:37.310
<i>This is where dogs
help man the most.</i>

38:37.312 --> 38:40.180
Looks like any other city
on any other day to me.

38:40.182 --> 38:42.917
<i>That's because it is, Piper.</i>

38:42.919 --> 38:45.352
<i>Most dogs share
their lives with man,</i>

38:45.354 --> 38:48.321
<i>so when trouble arises
or help is needed,</i>

38:48.323 --> 38:51.993
who's usually the first
on the scene? Dogs!

38:51.995 --> 38:53.995
Makes sense, Scuzzy Bot.

38:53.997 --> 38:56.730
But-But how many
emergencies

38:56.732 --> 38:58.933
do average people
face in a day?

38:58.935 --> 39:02.770
Uh, it depends on what we
consider emergencies, Boobear.

39:02.772 --> 39:06.473
Some people just need a little
help finding their lost car keys.

39:06.475 --> 39:09.142
Enter,
one sensitive-snouted canine.

39:09.144 --> 39:13.080
That's crazy. No wonder they
call dogs "man's best friend."

39:13.082 --> 39:14.982
Indeed, Piper.

39:14.984 --> 39:17.084
<i>Guard dogs have also
come in handy for humans,</i>

39:17.086 --> 39:20.354
<i>protecting homes and businesses
from break-ins and theft.</i>

39:20.356 --> 39:23.491
<i>Then, on the other hand,
someone might need help</i>

39:23.493 --> 39:25.859
escaping a dangerous flood.

39:25.861 --> 39:30.131
A heroic dog can certainly come
in handy there too, and has.

39:30.133 --> 39:31.933
<i>Wow!</i>

39:31.935 --> 39:34.201
<i>I'll be a dog biscuit.
That's incredible!</i>

39:34.203 --> 39:38.171
<i>Fires, floods,
and lost car keys.</i>

39:38.173 --> 39:42.075
<i>That covers a lot of the ways
someone can be helped.</i>

39:42.077 --> 39:44.444
<i>Just how did dogs
and humans develop</i>

39:44.446 --> 39:47.915
<i>such a strong bond anyway?</i>

39:47.917 --> 39:50.051
That's a great question, Piper.

39:50.053 --> 39:53.488
The domestic relationship
between dog and man

39:53.490 --> 39:57.924
has been traced back
about 13,000 years.

39:57.926 --> 40:00.495
Based on archeological
findings, including

40:00.497 --> 40:04.432
<i>dog bones buried near,
and sometimes with, human remains,</i>

40:04.434 --> 40:08.236
<i>it's been concluded that the
relationship between dogs and man</i>

40:08.238 --> 40:12.372
<i>has been developing almost
from the very beginning.</i>

40:12.374 --> 40:16.076
Sweet barbecue bones!
I had no idea.

40:16.078 --> 40:19.279
Do you think a dog's instinct
to be a part of a pack

40:19.281 --> 40:22.082
<i>figures into their close
relationship with humans?</i>

40:22.084 --> 40:25.520
<i>Do they actually see man
as a member of their pack?</i>

40:25.522 --> 40:28.455
<i>Excellent
question, Piper.</i>

40:28.457 --> 40:30.424
I see you're paying
close attention.

40:30.426 --> 40:34.194
It's true that dogs instinctively
want to bond with a pack.

40:34.196 --> 40:37.298
<i>The inborn desire to bond
could be a reason</i>

40:37.300 --> 40:40.301
<i>why they express such
unconditional loyalty</i>

40:40.303 --> 40:42.403
<i>and affection
for humans.</i>

40:42.405 --> 40:46.073
<i>Wow!
Do dogs think man is like them?</i>

40:46.075 --> 40:49.209
Just another
weird-looking dog?

40:49.211 --> 40:52.546
Interesting question, Boobear.

40:52.548 --> 40:55.582
Dogs know the difference
between themselves and man,

40:55.584 --> 40:58.986
but research suggests that
the closer the relationship,

40:58.988 --> 41:01.288
like a single owner
with a dog who gets

41:01.290 --> 41:04.524
all their attention, for
instance, the more likely it is

41:04.526 --> 41:08.196
that the dog views itself
as equal to man.

41:08.198 --> 41:10.598
Whoa!
Beagle brain blast!

41:10.600 --> 41:14.167
- That's incredible!
- I have a question.

41:14.169 --> 41:18.605
We heard that dogs are often
used in medical rehabilitation,

41:18.607 --> 41:21.209
like helping
the blind to see.

41:21.211 --> 41:23.910
<i>Do you know,
who was the very first</i>

41:23.912 --> 41:25.946
Seeing Eye dog,
Scuzzy Bot?

41:25.948 --> 41:29.015
<i>As a matter of
fact, I do, Boobear.</i>

41:29.017 --> 41:31.352
<i>The world's first
Seeing Eye guide dog</i>

41:31.354 --> 41:34.321
<i>was a female German shepherd
named Kiss,</i>

41:34.323 --> 41:38.225
<i>but renamed Buddy after training
to assist her new owner,</i>

41:38.227 --> 41:40.227
<i>a man named Morris Frank.</i>

41:40.229 --> 41:42.964
Buddy helped Mr. Frank to get
around in the world again,

41:42.966 --> 41:45.866
with activities like
crossing busy streets,

41:45.868 --> 41:49.035
<i>using staircases,
and opening doors...</i>

41:49.037 --> 41:52.205
things that had been previously
un-doable by a blind man.

41:52.207 --> 41:55.042
Hey, Piper,
I think we just found the answer

41:55.044 --> 41:58.245
to General Hot Dog's
"what the woof" question.

41:58.247 --> 42:00.915
You're right, Boobear.
The world's first

42:00.917 --> 42:05.319
Seeing Eye guide dog was Buddy,
belonging to Mr. Morris Frank.

42:05.321 --> 42:07.520
Congratulations
on finding the answer

42:07.522 --> 42:10.591
to this mission's "what the
woof" question, Pup Scouts.

42:10.593 --> 42:13.394
General Hot Dog
will be proud of you.

42:13.396 --> 42:15.932
No bones about it.

42:19.301 --> 42:22.169
Fantastic work,
Pup Scouts.

42:22.171 --> 42:26.274
Your mission was a great success.

42:26.276 --> 42:28.276
You're well on your way
to winning

42:28.278 --> 42:31.279
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award...

42:31.281 --> 42:35.082
and all the bones

42:35.084 --> 42:37.151
you can eat for a year!

42:37.153 --> 42:39.419
Tail-waggin' awesome!

42:39.421 --> 42:42.957
Say, were you able to
find out the answer

42:42.959 --> 42:45.625
to this mission's
"what the woof" question?

42:45.627 --> 42:48.328
Yes, General Hot Dog.
We sure did.

42:48.330 --> 42:52.198
The world's first Seeing Eye
guide dog was named Buddy.

42:52.200 --> 42:55.703
And Buddy helped a blind man
named Morris Frank.

42:55.705 --> 42:58.538
That's great!

42:58.540 --> 43:00.707
Good job, Pup Scouts!

43:00.709 --> 43:03.711
What's our next mission,
General Hot Dog?

43:03.713 --> 43:07.147
Your next mission
is going to be

43:07.149 --> 43:09.283
the most awesome yet.

43:09.285 --> 43:12.053
We want you to learn about

43:12.055 --> 43:14.120
different dog breeds.

43:14.122 --> 43:17.691
Dog breeds?
Wow! Cool!

43:17.693 --> 43:20.727
I'll be a bacon strip.
Can't wait to get started.

43:20.729 --> 43:23.296
Ears flappin'.

43:23.298 --> 43:25.165
Tail wiggling.

43:25.167 --> 43:28.234
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

43:37.412 --> 43:39.479
Whoo-hoo!

43:39.481 --> 43:42.116
Whoo-hoo!

43:42.118 --> 43:45.586
Greetings, Pup Scouts.

43:45.588 --> 43:47.187
Hey, General Hot Dog.

43:47.189 --> 43:49.357
Piper, Boobear, it's time

43:49.359 --> 43:51.725
for the annual Pup Scouts
of the World contest,

43:51.727 --> 43:54.428
where teams compete
for the chance to win

43:54.430 --> 43:57.765
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

43:57.767 --> 44:02.502
and all the bones
you can eat for a year.

44:02.504 --> 44:05.071
Your job is to chase,

44:05.073 --> 44:06.707
fetch and report

44:06.709 --> 44:09.576
all there is to know
about dogs,

44:09.578 --> 44:12.513
puppies, and everything
in between.

44:12.515 --> 44:16.350
You will travel
all over the world,

44:16.352 --> 44:19.520
across time,
space and beyond.

44:19.522 --> 44:22.790
You must keep your nose
to the wind,

44:22.792 --> 44:24.457
your ears perked,

44:24.459 --> 44:27.660
and your paws to the wheel
at all times.

44:27.662 --> 44:32.500
We depend on you to do
the best job possible.

44:32.502 --> 44:35.736
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

44:35.738 --> 44:38.738
- Tail wiggling.
- Ears flappin'.

44:38.740 --> 44:42.343
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

44:42.345 --> 44:44.444
This is sure to be

44:44.446 --> 44:46.379
a challenging mission,
little ones.

44:46.381 --> 44:48.314
Succulent wishbones!

44:48.316 --> 44:50.551
I love challenging
missions.

44:50.553 --> 44:52.453
Slappin' tails,
me too!

44:52.455 --> 44:56.189
I'm sending you two
on a mission to learn about

44:56.191 --> 44:58.292
dog breeds!

44:58.294 --> 45:01.462
- Dog breeds. How cool.
- Can't wait!

45:01.464 --> 45:04.230
It's up to you to learn
all about it,

45:04.232 --> 45:07.368
and report back to me
with what you've discovered.

45:07.370 --> 45:09.236
Sweet barbecue sauce!

45:09.238 --> 45:12.807
This is going to be
an incredible adventure!

45:12.809 --> 45:15.743
What can you tell us about dog
breeds, General Hot Dog?

45:15.745 --> 45:18.178
Now, that's

45:18.180 --> 45:20.413
a broad question, Piper.

45:20.415 --> 45:24.317
There are many different
dog breeds in the world,

45:24.319 --> 45:28.189
all distinguishable
by types

45:28.191 --> 45:31.191
and their unique traits
and characteristics.

45:31.193 --> 45:34.194
There are way too many
to list

45:34.196 --> 45:36.196
off the top of my head,
actually.

45:36.198 --> 45:39.767
Wow! I can't wait
to find out more.

45:39.769 --> 45:43.837
Lots and lots of different dog breeds.
Sounds so interesting.

45:43.839 --> 45:46.707
As you know,
Boobear and Piper, to win

45:46.709 --> 45:49.509
the annual Pup Scouts
of the World,

45:49.511 --> 45:52.879
you must find out
and learn

45:52.881 --> 45:56.216
tons of amazing facts
about dogs.

45:56.218 --> 45:59.252
- Yes, General Hot Dog.
- We will.

45:59.254 --> 46:01.221
Awesome!

46:01.223 --> 46:05.526
You must also know
there is a question

46:05.528 --> 46:08.162
that all the brightest
canine minds

46:08.164 --> 46:11.265
all over the world

46:11.267 --> 46:16.236
have not been able to answer
about dog breeds.

46:16.238 --> 46:17.904
We need
you two Pup Scouts

46:17.906 --> 46:19.673
to help us answer

46:19.675 --> 46:24.245
the "what the woof"
question about dog breeds.

46:24.247 --> 46:26.814
"What the woof" question?
How cool!

46:26.816 --> 46:28.515
What is the question?

46:28.517 --> 46:31.185
The question is,
"What dog

46:31.187 --> 46:35.689
was the world's first
mixed-breed dog?"

46:35.691 --> 46:37.758
By "mixed-breed," I mean

46:37.760 --> 46:40.560
a dog born from mating

46:40.562 --> 46:43.763
two different
purebred dogs

46:43.765 --> 46:46.466
to make a new breed

46:46.468 --> 46:50.303
containing characteristics
of both the mother

46:50.305 --> 46:52.540
and the father dog!

46:52.542 --> 46:55.743
That's a great question,
General Hot Dog.

46:55.745 --> 46:58.645
We'll sniff out the answer
in the wag of a puppy's tail.

46:58.647 --> 46:59.747
You'll see.

46:59.749 --> 47:03.183
I will assign you
the best

47:03.185 --> 47:06.787
Pup Scout helper in the world:
Scuzzy Bot.

47:06.789 --> 47:11.258
He's a robotic encyclopedia
of canine knowledge.

47:11.260 --> 47:15.662
He will assist you
on your mission.

47:15.664 --> 47:18.566
Scuzzy Bot!
We love Scuzzy Bot!

47:18.568 --> 47:23.236
Be sure to ask a lot
of questions, Pup Scouts.

47:23.238 --> 47:28.341
You have a prestigious
Smartest Pooch award to win,

47:28.343 --> 47:30.877
and all the bones

47:30.879 --> 47:32.613
you can eat for a year!

47:32.615 --> 47:36.584
Have an amazing adventure,
you two.

47:36.586 --> 47:37.750
All right!

47:37.752 --> 47:39.653
Pup Scouts...

47:39.655 --> 47:41.221
Hurray!

47:48.798 --> 47:52.966
Pup Scouts, ready to get started
on your next adventure?

47:52.968 --> 47:55.301
- Super ready!
- Ha, ha!

47:55.303 --> 47:57.303
Is a Frisbee
ready to fly?

47:57.305 --> 47:59.772
Remember, Pup Scouts,
any and all questions you have,

47:59.774 --> 48:02.776
- I'm here to answer them.
- Where do we begin?

48:02.778 --> 48:06.613
Where else? Let's begin
at the most fun place to see

48:06.615 --> 48:09.015
different dog breeds
on parade

48:09.017 --> 48:12.752
and one of the big three
major competitive dog shows

48:12.754 --> 48:15.723
in the United States,
the National Dog Show!

48:15.725 --> 48:19.359
I'll be a hot dog without mustard.
I didn't know that.

48:19.361 --> 48:23.430
Starting way back in 1879,

48:23.432 --> 48:26.933
it was originally known as the
Kennel Club of Philadelphia Dog Show.

48:26.935 --> 48:28.968
the Kennel Club
of Philadelphia

48:28.970 --> 48:31.772
was one of the founding clubs
of the American Kennel Club,

48:31.774 --> 48:35.008
who we previously learned about,
if you recall.

48:35.010 --> 48:37.910
In 2002, NBC began airing

48:37.912 --> 48:40.913
the annual the Kennel Club
of Philadelphia Dog Show

48:40.915 --> 48:42.616
every Thanksgiving Day,

48:42.618 --> 48:45.653
and they renamed it
the National Dog Show.

48:45.655 --> 48:48.622
Sweet pork chops!
That's amazing!

48:48.624 --> 48:51.524
I'll be a kitty cat.
I didn't know that.

48:51.526 --> 48:53.694
Oh, well,
there you go, Boobear.

48:53.696 --> 48:55.729
The show has been
put on every year

48:55.731 --> 48:58.732
since its inception
in 1879,

48:58.734 --> 49:01.901
with the exception of a break
during America's Great Depression

49:01.903 --> 49:05.471
from 1928 through 1932.

49:05.473 --> 49:07.441
And the show traditionally
features

49:07.443 --> 49:09.575
a dazzling array
of dog breeds...

49:09.577 --> 49:12.312
more dog breeds
than I can even remember.

49:12.314 --> 49:13.881
You name the breed,

49:13.883 --> 49:16.716
and it's probably appeared here
throughout the years.

49:16.718 --> 49:18.718
Incredible!

49:18.720 --> 49:22.423
Hit my puppy brain with more
incredible facts, Scuzzy Bot.

49:22.425 --> 49:25.792
The National Dog Show has hosted
some of the most fun

49:25.794 --> 49:28.761
and funniest dog breeds ever
displayed to the public.

49:28.763 --> 49:31.799
Every breed's traits,
strengths,

49:31.801 --> 49:35.935
endearing qualities and quirks
are on full display at this show.

49:35.937 --> 49:39.740
And with an impressive
network TV audience of over

49:39.742 --> 49:43.076
20 million viewers,
the dog breeds that compete

49:43.078 --> 49:46.113
at the National Dog Show
get a lot of attention.

49:46.115 --> 49:49.816
- Totally woof-tastic.
- It sure is, Piper.

49:49.818 --> 49:51.884
And just some of the dogs that
have won the competition

49:51.886 --> 49:54.555
in recent years reads like
a who's who

49:54.557 --> 49:56.089
of barking superstars.

49:56.091 --> 49:58.892
Breeds like
the American foxhound,

49:58.894 --> 50:01.761
the bloodhound, Skye terrier,
the greyhound,

50:01.763 --> 50:05.399
the wire fox terrier,
the Irish setter, Scottish setter,

50:05.401 --> 50:08.569
the pointer,
Australian shepherd and toy poodles

50:08.571 --> 50:11.939
have all claimed the dog show's
highest prize: Best in Show.

50:11.941 --> 50:14.107
Amazing!

50:14.109 --> 50:16.576
Have any mixed dog breeds
ever won

50:16.578 --> 50:19.113
Best in Show at
the National Dog Show?

50:19.115 --> 50:21.482
Great question, Boobear.

50:21.484 --> 50:23.917
But no. Mixed-breed
or crossbreed dogs

50:23.919 --> 50:28.522
are specifically banned from
competing in the National Dog Show,

50:28.524 --> 50:30.691
which showcases only the best

50:30.693 --> 50:33.593
100% purebred dogs
it can find.

50:33.595 --> 50:36.095
You don't say?
That sounds great

50:36.097 --> 50:38.999
for purebred dogs,
but not so much for crossbreeds,

50:39.001 --> 50:42.636
who surely are
just as beautiful, impressive,

50:42.638 --> 50:45.772
talented and lovable,
right, Scuzzy Bot?

50:45.774 --> 50:49.410
Right, Piper. And funny
you mention it, because

50:49.412 --> 50:52.613
dog lovers the world over
recognized exactly that,

50:52.615 --> 50:56.450
which is why there are now
mixed-breed dog show competitions,

50:56.452 --> 50:58.519
showcasing
the best mutts

50:58.521 --> 51:00.421
from around the world.

51:00.423 --> 51:02.189
Whoa!

51:02.191 --> 51:04.892
Tell us about some
of these dog shows.

51:04.894 --> 51:08.127
And who are the dogs
who've won them, Scuzzy Bot?

51:08.129 --> 51:12.131
Absolutely, Boobear.
The mixed-breed dog clubs of America

51:12.133 --> 51:14.801
have made great strides
in including

51:14.803 --> 51:17.203
some amazing crossbred dogs

51:17.205 --> 51:19.740
in high-level
competitions.

51:19.742 --> 51:22.743
Some prominent groups,
events, and championship games

51:22.745 --> 51:25.678
that now focus on
mixed-breed dogs

51:25.680 --> 51:28.214
are the United Kennel Club,
Classic Canine Games,

51:28.216 --> 51:30.817
the Mixed-Breed Clubs
of America,

51:30.819 --> 51:33.986
and the North American
Flyball Association.

51:33.988 --> 51:36.723
Whoa, Scuzzy Bot,
that factoid is cooler

51:36.725 --> 51:38.459
than a popsicle after a run.

51:38.461 --> 51:41.727
So, do the major dog clubs
now recognize

51:41.729 --> 51:45.165
these previously ignored
mixed breeds, Scuzzy Bot?

51:45.167 --> 51:47.734
Great question, Boobear.

51:47.736 --> 51:50.970
And the answer is, yes.
Since 2010,

51:50.972 --> 51:53.607
the American Kennel Club
has included

51:53.609 --> 51:56.176
clearly mixed breeds
in its competitions,

51:56.178 --> 51:59.513
delighting dog lovers
the world over.

51:59.515 --> 52:01.747
That's awesome!
After all,

52:01.749 --> 52:04.517
a dog's skill,
beauty and intelligence

52:04.519 --> 52:07.888
shouldn't be confined only to
pure breeding, right Scuzzy Bot?

52:07.890 --> 52:11.558
Very good point, Boobear.
That's right.

52:11.560 --> 52:14.528
In fact, some very notable
and popular dog breeds

52:14.530 --> 52:17.029
have appeared as a result
of crossbreeding,

52:17.031 --> 52:19.700
and many of these dogs
are actually healthier

52:19.702 --> 52:21.968
than the strictly
purebred ones.

52:21.970 --> 52:24.604
Yowza! Can you tell us
about some of them?

52:24.606 --> 52:28.075
I can do better than that, Piper.
Why don't we take a look?

52:28.077 --> 52:31.544
- Whoa! Can we?
- Sure, we can.

52:31.546 --> 52:33.212
Here we go!

52:33.214 --> 52:35.281
Uh, it kinda feels

52:35.283 --> 52:38.151
like we're heading into
Frankenstein's laboratory.

52:38.153 --> 52:41.087
Nothing to worry about, Boobear.

52:41.089 --> 52:44.124
Designer dogs,
as some people call them,

52:44.126 --> 52:46.826
are every bit as loyal
and lovable as pure breeds.

52:46.828 --> 52:49.529
Come on.
Let's check 'em out and see.

52:49.531 --> 52:52.533
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yay!

52:52.535 --> 52:56.904
Here we are, Pup Scouts:
designer dog paradise.

52:56.906 --> 52:58.839
A crossbreeding
wonderland.

52:58.841 --> 53:00.908
Holy burger balls.

53:00.910 --> 53:02.975
What's that one
over there?

53:02.977 --> 53:06.279
Ah, that's the Frankenstein
terrier, Piper.

53:06.281 --> 53:08.247
The what?

53:08.249 --> 53:10.049
I'm only kidding,
Boobear.

53:10.051 --> 53:12.151
These dogs are
some of the cutest,

53:12.153 --> 53:14.754
most unique mutts
you'll find anywhere.

53:14.756 --> 53:17.223
- Let's meet them, shall we?
- As long as they don't bite.

53:17.225 --> 53:20.026
They don't bite, right?

53:20.028 --> 53:22.129
No, they don't bite,
Piper.

53:22.131 --> 53:23.897
Take this little guy,
for instance.

53:23.899 --> 53:27.066
<i>This one's lovingly
referred to as a dorgi.</i>

53:27.068 --> 53:30.636
<i>That's a Dalmatian and a corgi,
for your information.</i>

53:30.638 --> 53:34.941
And we have here a pitsky...
pit bull and husky.

53:34.943 --> 53:39.046
And while we're here, we mustn't ignore
the chusky... chow chow and husky.

53:39.048 --> 53:41.714
And look over there
at that one.

53:41.716 --> 53:44.951
<i>That's a Labsky...
Labrador retriever and husky.</i>

53:44.953 --> 53:47.754
Wow! I'll be a chew toy.
That's amazing!

53:47.756 --> 53:50.723
It looks like huskies are
popular in crossbreeding.

53:50.725 --> 53:53.359
Are any other dog breeds
mixed often?

53:53.361 --> 53:56.729
That's a great question,
Piper! Truth is,

53:56.731 --> 53:59.131
the combinations
are endless.

53:59.133 --> 54:03.303
There we have the absolutely
adorable Chug... Chihuahua and pug...

54:03.305 --> 54:07.774
<i>and the cuddle-icious Dalmuchsund...
Dalmatian and dachshund,</i>

54:07.776 --> 54:09.709
<i>Then there's the Yorkiepoo,</i>

54:09.711 --> 54:12.245
the corman shepherd,
and on and on.

54:12.247 --> 54:15.314
Amazing bouncing balls!
I had no idea!

54:15.316 --> 54:19.019
Is it safe to cross breed
any dog, Scuzzy Bot,

54:19.021 --> 54:21.187
or are there
health risks involved?

54:21.189 --> 54:24.156
Excellent question, Piper.
I see you're paying close attention.

54:24.158 --> 54:27.394
Studies have actually
found a few more

54:27.396 --> 54:30.663
genetic defects in purebreds
than in mixed breeds.

54:30.665 --> 54:33.299
But overall, there seems to be
no recurring trends

54:33.301 --> 54:36.403
in the genetic health
or illness of a dog

54:36.405 --> 54:38.805
based on
crossbreeding alone.

54:38.807 --> 54:43.009
So by all accounts,
it is not dangerous to mix dog breeds.

54:43.011 --> 54:45.845
Leftover-licious,
that's great!

54:45.847 --> 54:48.048
By contrast,
some pure breeds

54:48.050 --> 54:50.917
experience negative health
trends that are quite unpleasant

54:50.919 --> 54:53.819
and sometimes even
life-threatening.

54:53.821 --> 54:56.323
Great Danes' hearts
sometimes struggle

54:56.325 --> 54:58.091
to support
their giant bodies.

54:58.093 --> 55:00.394
King Charles spaniels
are sometimes born

55:00.396 --> 55:03.430
with heads too small
for their brains,

55:03.432 --> 55:07.801
and a reported 60% of golden
retrievers contract cancer.

55:07.803 --> 55:11.138
So while purebreds remain
as popular as ever at dog shows,

55:11.140 --> 55:15.241
there can be risks in maintaining
those perfect breed standards.

55:15.243 --> 55:19.111
Whoa, I'm just blown away.
I didn't realize that.

55:19.113 --> 55:20.980
I have a question.

55:20.982 --> 55:23.850
What was the first-ever
mixed-breed dog, Scuzzy Bot?

55:23.852 --> 55:27.988
Good question. And I have a
two-part answer for you, Boobear.

55:27.990 --> 55:31.258
The very first mutt,
or mixed-breed dog,

55:31.260 --> 55:33.125
is actually impossible
to know.

55:33.127 --> 55:36.830
From the beginning,
dogs have crossbred

55:36.832 --> 55:40.232
and been intentionally crossbred
to create stronger breeds

55:40.234 --> 55:43.970
more suited to particular tasks
with specific desired traits.

55:43.972 --> 55:48.274
Even purebred dogs are the
result of early crossbreeding,

55:48.276 --> 55:52.845
and only designated pure
by modern sanctioning bodies,

55:52.847 --> 55:55.781
like the American Kennel Club,
who applied what they called

55:55.783 --> 55:58.785
a breed standard
to the animal.

55:58.787 --> 56:01.721
By those modern standards,
I can tell you who the first

56:01.723 --> 56:03.490
mixed-breed dog show
champion was.

56:03.492 --> 56:05.892
Her name was Katie Lee,

56:05.894 --> 56:09.830
a former shelter dog who,
in April 2010,

56:09.832 --> 56:13.399
became the first-ever mutt
to win an AKC title.

56:13.401 --> 56:16.136
Hey, Piper,
I think we just found the answer

56:16.138 --> 56:19.004
to General Hot Dog's
"what the woof" question.

56:19.006 --> 56:22.209
You're right, Boobear. There's no way
to know the first mixed-breed dog,

56:22.211 --> 56:26.979
but Katie Lee was the first one to
win a championship under modern rules.

56:26.981 --> 56:29.182
Congratulations
on finding the answer

56:29.184 --> 56:32.285
to this mission's "what the
woof" question, Pup Scouts.

56:32.287 --> 56:36.392
General Hot Dog will be proud of
you, no bones about it.

56:38.961 --> 56:42.095
Fantastic work,
Pup Scouts.

56:42.097 --> 56:45.799
Your mission was
a great success.

56:45.801 --> 56:50.136
You're well on your way
to winning the prestigious

56:50.138 --> 56:54.040
Smartest Pooch award
and...

56:54.042 --> 56:56.509
all the bones

56:56.511 --> 56:59.212
you can eat for a year!

56:59.214 --> 57:01.180
Ball-bouncin' awesome!

57:01.182 --> 57:04.484
Were you able to find
the answer to this mission's

57:04.486 --> 57:06.953
"what the woof" question?

57:06.955 --> 57:09.055
Yes, General Hot Dog.
We sure did.

57:09.057 --> 57:12.926
There's no way to know who was
the first mixed-breed dog.

57:12.928 --> 57:15.162
But a former shelter dog
named Katie Lee

57:15.164 --> 57:18.365
was the very first American
Kennel Club-certified

57:18.367 --> 57:20.332
mixed-breed champion.

57:20.334 --> 57:22.201
That's great!

57:22.203 --> 57:25.205
Good job, Pup Scouts.

57:25.207 --> 57:27.473
What's our next mission,
General Hot Dog?

57:27.475 --> 57:30.075
Your next mission
is going to be

57:30.077 --> 57:33.546
your most awesome yet.

57:33.548 --> 57:36.816
We want you
to learn about

57:36.818 --> 57:40.520
Chinese chow chows
and pugs!

57:40.522 --> 57:43.924
Chinese chow chows
and pugs?

57:43.926 --> 57:46.826
- Super awesome! -Cool.
Can't wait to get started.

57:46.828 --> 57:48.528
Tail wiggling.

57:48.530 --> 57:51.163
Ears flappin'.

57:51.165 --> 57:54.033
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

58:07.216 --> 58:10.950
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoo-hoo!

58:10.952 --> 58:14.321
- Greetings, Pup Scouts.
- Hey, General Hot Dog.

58:14.323 --> 58:18.225
- Hey, General Hot Dog.
- Piper, Boobear,

58:18.227 --> 58:20.526
it's time for the annual
Pup Scouts of the World contest,

58:20.528 --> 58:23.263
where teams compete
for the chance to win

58:23.265 --> 58:26.566
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

58:26.568 --> 58:30.636
and all the bones
you can eat for a year.

58:32.274 --> 58:35.508
Your job is to chase,
fetch and report

58:35.510 --> 58:38.310
all there is to know
about dogs,

58:38.312 --> 58:41.348
puppies,
and everything in between.

58:41.350 --> 58:45.151
You will travel
all over the world,

58:45.153 --> 58:48.321
across time,
space and beyond.

58:48.323 --> 58:50.957
You must keep your nose
to the wind,

58:50.959 --> 58:53.192
your ears perked,

58:53.194 --> 58:56.529
and your paws to the wheel
at all times.

58:56.531 --> 59:01.334
We depend on you to do
the best job possible.

59:01.336 --> 59:03.904
Are you ready for
your first assignment?

59:03.906 --> 59:05.504
Tail wiggling.

59:05.506 --> 59:07.573
Ears flappin'.

59:07.575 --> 59:11.044
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.

59:11.046 --> 59:15.214
This is sure to be a challenging
mission, little ones.

59:15.216 --> 59:17.216
Succulent wishbones!

59:17.218 --> 59:19.419
I love challenging missions.

59:19.421 --> 59:21.321
Slappin' tails, me too!

59:21.323 --> 59:24.557
I'm sending you two
on a mission to learn about

59:24.559 --> 59:26.459
chow chows and pugs!

59:26.461 --> 59:31.031
- Chow chows and pugs? How cool!
- Can't wait!

59:31.033 --> 59:33.600
It's up to you to learn
all about it

59:33.602 --> 59:36.937
and report back to me
with what you've discovered.

59:36.939 --> 59:38.604
Sweet barbecue sauce!

59:38.606 --> 59:41.374
This is going to be
an incredible adventure!

59:41.376 --> 59:46.111
What can you tell us about chow
chows and pugs, General Hot Dog?

59:46.113 --> 59:49.348
The chow chow is a dog breed
from northern China.

59:49.350 --> 59:53.486
In China, it's referred to
as <i>songshi quan,</i>

59:53.488 --> 59:56.355
which means
"puffy lion dog."

59:56.357 --> 01:00:00.526
The pug is also from China,
and it was brought to Europe

01:00:00.528 --> 01:00:03.395
way back in the 16th century,

01:00:03.397 --> 01:00:07.100
where it achieved great popularity
through the royal families,

01:00:07.102 --> 01:00:11.537
particularly the United
Kingdom's Queen Victoria.

01:00:11.539 --> 01:00:15.274
Wow! I can't wait
to find out more.

01:00:15.276 --> 01:00:18.444
Chow chows and pugs?
Sounds so interesting.

01:00:18.446 --> 01:00:20.613
As you know,
Boobear and Piper,

01:00:20.615 --> 01:00:24.183
to win the annual
Pup Scouts of the World,

01:00:24.185 --> 01:00:27.553
you must find out
and learn

01:00:27.555 --> 01:00:30.689
tons of amazing facts
about dogs.

01:00:30.691 --> 01:00:33.660
- Yes, General Hot Dog.
- We will.

01:00:33.662 --> 01:00:35.595
Awesome!

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:40.033
You must also know that
there is a question

01:00:40.035 --> 01:00:42.468
that all the brightest
canine minds

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.404
all over the world

01:00:44.406 --> 01:00:46.473
have not been able
to answer about

01:00:46.475 --> 01:00:49.042
chow chows and pugs!

01:00:49.044 --> 01:00:51.778
We need
you two Pup Scouts

01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:55.115
to help us answer the
"what the woof" question

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:58.183
about dog breeds!

01:00:58.185 --> 01:01:01.587
"What the woof" question?
How cool. What is the question?

01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:04.723
The "what the woof"
question is this:

01:01:04.725 --> 01:01:08.761
"Can you name
one physical trait

01:01:08.763 --> 01:01:12.698
that is found in both
chow chows and pugs?"

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:15.368
That's a great question,
General Hot Dog.

01:01:15.370 --> 01:01:18.671
We'll sniff out the answer
in the wag of a puppy's tail.

01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:20.240
You'll see.

01:01:20.242 --> 01:01:22.441
I will assign you
the best

01:01:22.443 --> 01:01:27.247
Pup Scout helper in the world:
Scuzzy Bot.

01:01:27.249 --> 01:01:31.584
He's a robotic encyclopedia
of canine knowledge.

01:01:31.586 --> 01:01:36.189
He will assist you
on your mission.

01:01:36.191 --> 01:01:39.091
Scuzzy Bot!
We love Scuzzy Bot!

01:01:39.093 --> 01:01:43.595
Be sure to ask a lot
of questions, Pup Scouts.

01:01:43.597 --> 01:01:45.631
You have a prestigious

01:01:45.633 --> 01:01:48.667
Smartest Pooch award to win,

01:01:48.669 --> 01:01:53.105
and all the bones
you can eat for a year!

01:01:53.107 --> 01:01:57.076
Have an amazing adventure,
you two.

01:01:57.078 --> 01:01:58.243
All right!

01:01:58.245 --> 01:02:00.145
Pup Scouts...

01:02:00.147 --> 01:02:01.513
Hurray!

01:02:09.290 --> 01:02:11.357
Pup Scouts!

01:02:11.359 --> 01:02:13.459
Ready to get started
on your next adventure?

01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:15.662
Super ready.

01:02:15.664 --> 01:02:17.596
Is a Frisbee ready to fly?

01:02:17.598 --> 01:02:20.399
Remember, Pup Scouts,
any and all questions you have,

01:02:20.401 --> 01:02:22.502
I'm here to answer them.

01:02:22.504 --> 01:02:25.839
- Where do we begin?
- We're going on a journey, Pup Scouts.

01:02:25.841 --> 01:02:28.674
Today, we'll begin
where both of these

01:02:28.676 --> 01:02:31.379
great dog breeds began:
China.

01:02:33.147 --> 01:02:34.848
Here we are, Pup Scouts...

01:02:34.850 --> 01:02:38.183
the homeland of both
chow chows and pugs...

01:02:38.185 --> 01:02:39.819
the country of China.

01:02:39.821 --> 01:02:44.256
With a huge population
of over one billion people,

01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:46.558
it's big and busy.

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:50.796
Chow chows and pugs
go back a long way,

01:02:50.798 --> 01:02:54.334
as both of them are
considered ancient dog breeds.

01:02:54.336 --> 01:02:57.236
Sweet pork chops!
That's amazing!

01:02:57.238 --> 01:03:00.707
I'll be a hot dog without mustard.
I didn't know that.

01:03:00.709 --> 01:03:04.810
Oh, there's a lot to know about
chow chows and pugs, Boobear.

01:03:04.812 --> 01:03:07.747
- So let's get to learning.
- Incredible!

01:03:07.749 --> 01:03:11.216
Hit my puppy brain
with more info, Scuzzy Bot.

01:03:11.218 --> 01:03:12.852
Let's find out more.

01:03:12.854 --> 01:03:15.354
Both of these dogs have
such interesting

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:18.223
and varied histories,
yet in some ways,

01:03:18.225 --> 01:03:20.792
they're not as different
as they look.

01:03:20.794 --> 01:03:22.694
Both chow chows and pugs
were big favorites

01:03:22.696 --> 01:03:25.865
of the early monarchies
and royal families.

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:28.200
Amazing!

01:03:28.202 --> 01:03:31.270
Why did kings and queens
like them so much, Scuzzy Bot?

01:03:31.272 --> 01:03:34.473
Great question, Boobear.
As we know,

01:03:34.475 --> 01:03:37.243
every dog is a loyal friend
to someone in their life.

01:03:37.245 --> 01:03:39.812
But chow chows are known
for their loyalty

01:03:39.814 --> 01:03:42.814
above most else...
so much so,

01:03:42.816 --> 01:03:44.683
that they were used
as palace guards

01:03:44.685 --> 01:03:47.620
in ancient China,
Mongolia and Tibet.

01:03:47.622 --> 01:03:50.622
Wow. Cool bit
of chow info.

01:03:50.624 --> 01:03:53.593
Can you tell us what cool stuff
pugs have done?

01:03:53.595 --> 01:03:56.763
I sure can. Whereas
chow chows have a reputation

01:03:56.765 --> 01:03:59.832
for being fierce to strangers,
pugs have a reputation

01:03:59.834 --> 01:04:03.602
for being gentle, sociable,
and intuitive to their owners' moods.

01:04:03.604 --> 01:04:07.339
Early Chinese emperors valued
their pugs so greatly

01:04:07.341 --> 01:04:09.676
that the dogs had
their own palace guards.

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:11.511
Jumpin' jerky treats!

01:04:11.513 --> 01:04:14.714
So, chow chows
worked as guards,

01:04:14.716 --> 01:04:17.216
and pugs had guards.

01:04:17.218 --> 01:04:19.752
Did a chow chow ever guard
a pug, Scuzzy Bot?

01:04:19.754 --> 01:04:22.654
I'm not sure, Boobear,

01:04:22.656 --> 01:04:24.624
but it's certainly possible.

01:04:24.626 --> 01:04:26.758
Although the pug
was also employed

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:30.229
as a guard dog throughout
the 16th and 17th centuries,

01:04:30.231 --> 01:04:32.631
after one famous pug named
Pompeii saved the life

01:04:32.633 --> 01:04:35.267
of Europe's Prince of Orange
in 1572

01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:37.870
by warning him
of approaching assassins.

01:04:37.872 --> 01:04:42.575
Chow chows and pugs sure sound
loyal, and smart too!

01:04:42.577 --> 01:04:44.310
<i>Do they do well
in training?</i>

01:04:44.312 --> 01:04:46.011
<i>Excellent question, Boobear.</i>

01:04:46.013 --> 01:04:48.814
<i>Chow chows are actually known
for being resistant to training</i>

01:04:48.816 --> 01:04:52.685
<i>and kind of stubborn unless they're
taught well from a very young age.</i>

01:04:52.687 --> 01:04:55.654
<i>As they get older,
they're known to become attached</i>

01:04:55.656 --> 01:04:58.558
<i>and overly protective
of one family member,</i>

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:01.828
<i>unless they receive dedicated
and regular socialization.</i>

01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:06.299
Interesting.
And what about pugs, Scuzzy Bot?

01:05:06.301 --> 01:05:09.701
They seem too cute and cuddly
to be antisocial.

01:05:09.703 --> 01:05:11.904
Very good observation,
Boobear.

01:05:11.906 --> 01:05:15.341
Pugs actually have a reputation
for being lazy

01:05:15.343 --> 01:05:17.609
and can spend a lot
of time napping

01:05:17.611 --> 01:05:20.046
<i>if they don't have
the proper stimulation.</i>

01:05:20.048 --> 01:05:24.283
A big family with lots of action
and attention suits them well.

01:05:24.285 --> 01:05:26.019
Unlike chow chows,
they're great with children

01:05:26.021 --> 01:05:28.654
and the perfect size to play

01:05:28.656 --> 01:05:30.490
without anyone getting
accidentally hurt.

01:05:30.492 --> 01:05:33.792
That's awesome. Pugs sound
pretty low-maintenance.

01:05:33.794 --> 01:05:35.895
In some ways
they are, Piper,

01:05:35.897 --> 01:05:38.897
but in some other ways,
they require a lot of maintenance.

01:05:38.899 --> 01:05:41.433
You see, pugs have some
unique physical traits

01:05:41.435 --> 01:05:43.669
that make them prone
to health problems

01:05:43.671 --> 01:05:45.837
that other dogs
don't have to worry about.

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:48.040
Whoa. Like what,
Scuzzy Bot?

01:05:48.042 --> 01:05:51.678
Well, on account of
their short, mashed snouts,

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.513
pugs are subject to
breathing problems, allergies,

01:05:54.515 --> 01:05:57.015
and something called
"reverse sneezing."

01:05:57.017 --> 01:05:59.017
Reverse sneezing?

01:05:59.019 --> 01:06:02.654
You mean, they sneeze
into their own mouths?

01:06:02.656 --> 01:06:05.957
No, Boobear. Reverse sneezing

01:06:05.959 --> 01:06:08.560
is characterized
by loud gasping and snorting

01:06:08.562 --> 01:06:11.397
that makes it look like
a dog's choking.

01:06:11.399 --> 01:06:13.366
These episodes
usually aren't harmful,

01:06:13.368 --> 01:06:16.468
but other genetic pug issues
could lead to blocked airways

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.538
that make the dog pass out
or overheat.

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.441
With a little regular
care and maintenance,

01:06:21.443 --> 01:06:23.109
these conditions
can be overcome,

01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:25.645
allowing the pug to lead
a normal lifespan

01:06:25.647 --> 01:06:27.446
of about 11 years,

01:06:27.448 --> 01:06:29.915
though the oldest known pug
lived to be 20.

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:32.954
Look at those chow chows.
Let's check 'em out.

01:06:34.689 --> 01:06:36.089
Here we are, Pup Scouts...

01:06:36.091 --> 01:06:38.857
a genuine Chinese
chow chow kennel,

01:06:38.859 --> 01:06:42.095
complete with oodles of the cute
little buggers, and big buggers!

01:06:42.097 --> 01:06:46.765
They do it all here, from breeding
to training to competitive showing

01:06:46.767 --> 01:06:49.102
to finding these dogs
their forever homes.

01:06:49.104 --> 01:06:52.772
Wow. I can see a lot of the
traits you mentioned, Scuzzy Bot.

01:06:52.774 --> 01:06:54.573
Chow chows really are loyal,

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:57.542
playful and ferocious,
all at once.

01:06:57.544 --> 01:07:00.046
That they are,
and then some, Piper,

01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:03.915
all rolled up in a cute,
super-fuzzy ball of impressive canine.

01:07:03.917 --> 01:07:06.718
Hopping hot hamburger patties,
look at that one!

01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.721
What's that chow doing
over there?

01:07:09.723 --> 01:07:12.924
It looks like he's
ready to go play, Boobear.

01:07:12.926 --> 01:07:16.928
Chow chows sure can
be funny when they want to be.

01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.933
Oh, don't let their stoic
guard-dog traits fool you, Piper.

01:07:20.935 --> 01:07:25.004
Chows can be downright goofy.
Take a look at that crazy one.

01:07:25.006 --> 01:07:28.841
Wow! I'll be a dog biscuit.
That's incredible!

01:07:28.843 --> 01:07:31.843
Are there pug kennels too,
where pugs can be bred,

01:07:31.845 --> 01:07:34.613
<i>raised, trained
and adopted?</i>

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:38.618
That's a great question, Piper!
Yes, there sure are pug kennels.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:40.685
As a matter of fact,
turn around.

01:07:40.687 --> 01:07:43.122
There happens to be one
right over there.

01:07:43.124 --> 01:07:46.426
Sweet bones of delight!
You're right!

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:48.428
Mighty marrow bone chews!

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:51.531
Pugs are so darn cute
and cuddly.

01:07:51.533 --> 01:07:53.933
I almost can't stand it!

01:07:53.935 --> 01:07:58.069
Say, why are some pugs beige
while others are black?

01:07:58.071 --> 01:08:01.908
Are those the only two colors
a pug comes in?

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:06.044
Excellent question, Piper!
I see you're paying close attention.

01:08:06.046 --> 01:08:08.513
Those two colors,
known as black and fawn,

01:08:08.515 --> 01:08:11.116
<i>are generally the most common
pug coat colors,</i>

01:08:11.118 --> 01:08:15.754
<i>and also the only two colors recognized
by the the American Kennel Club,</i>

01:08:15.756 --> 01:08:18.758
although pug coats can and do
span a spectrum of colors,

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.827
including shades
of silver and gold.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:24.796
Cool! So do chow chows also

01:08:24.798 --> 01:08:28.733
come in more colors than the black
and golden brown we often see?

01:08:28.734 --> 01:08:30.603
Absolutely, Boobear.

01:08:30.604 --> 01:08:33.906
Chows generally appear
in five different coat colors:

01:08:33.908 --> 01:08:37.577
black, cinnamon, red,
blue and cream.

01:08:37.578 --> 01:08:41.546
<i>They're usually just as fluffy,
though, no matter what color they are.</i>

01:08:41.548 --> 01:08:44.884
Whoa! Total brain blast.
That's incredible!

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:47.953
I have a question.
Besides hailing from China

01:08:47.955 --> 01:08:50.956
and being loyal
to their families,

01:08:50.957 --> 01:08:54.527
do chow chows and pugs have any
specific traits in common, Scuzzy Bot?

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.895
Hmm. You bet they do,
Boobear.

01:08:56.897 --> 01:08:59.564
Both chow chows and pugs

01:08:59.566 --> 01:09:02.734
share the common trait of
a blue, black or spotted tongue.

01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:06.706
Thirty percent of purebred dogs
share this distinctive trait,

01:09:06.707 --> 01:09:09.675
and the chow chow and pug
are within that percentage.

01:09:09.676 --> 01:09:12.111
Hey, Piper,
I think we just found the answer

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:15.214
to General Hot Dog's
"what the woof" question.

01:09:15.216 --> 01:09:18.518
You're right, Boobear.
Chow chows and pugs both

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:22.188
both share the tendency for
blue, black or spotted tongues.

01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:24.223
Congratulations
on finding the answer

01:09:24.225 --> 01:09:27.559
to this mission's "what the
woof" question, Pup Scouts.

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.895
General Hot Dog
will be proud of you.

01:09:29.897 --> 01:09:31.600
No bones about it.

01:09:33.901 --> 01:09:37.103
Fantastic work,
Pup Scouts.

01:09:37.104 --> 01:09:40.872
Your mission was
a great success.

01:09:40.874 --> 01:09:43.843
You're well on your way
to winning

01:09:43.845 --> 01:09:47.880
the prestigious
Smartest Pooch award

01:09:47.881 --> 01:09:50.282
and...

01:09:50.283 --> 01:09:54.219
all the bones you can eat
for a year!

01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:56.221
Tail-waggin' awesome!

01:09:56.223 --> 01:09:59.724
Were you able to find
the answer to this mission's

01:09:59.726 --> 01:10:01.993
"what the woof" question?

01:10:01.995 --> 01:10:04.130
Yes, General Hot Dog,
we did.

01:10:04.132 --> 01:10:06.999
Chow chows and pugs
both share the tendency

01:10:07.001 --> 01:10:09.201
for blue, black
or spotted tongues.

01:10:09.203 --> 01:10:12.971
Thirty percent of pure breeds
have this characteristic,

01:10:12.973 --> 01:10:16.008
including the chow chows
and the pugs.

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.876
That's great!

01:10:17.878 --> 01:10:20.880
Good job, Pup Scouts!

01:10:20.882 --> 01:10:23.215
What's our next mission,
General Hot Dog?

01:10:23.217 --> 01:10:28.054
Your next mission is going to be
your most awesome yet.

01:10:28.056 --> 01:10:30.590
We want you
to learn about

01:10:30.592 --> 01:10:33.725
French bulldogs
and poodles!

01:10:33.727 --> 01:10:37.028
French bulldogs and poodles?
Wow, cool!

01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:40.866
I'll be a squeaky toy.
Can't wait to get started.

01:10:40.868 --> 01:10:44.804
- Tail wiggling.
- Ears flappin'.

01:10:44.806 --> 01:10:49.108
Pup Scouts are ready for
the chase, General Hot Dog.
