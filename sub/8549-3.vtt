SUPPOSED TO DO,

TO DINNER?

CARL IS MY SON,

08:10.524 --> 08:14.161
AND IN MY EYES,
HE CAN DO NO WRONG.

08:14.227 --> 08:15.462
BUT HE'S
YOUR HUSBAND.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.930
YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOCKED HIM

08:16.997 --> 08:20.534
INTO THE MIDDLE
OF NEXT WEEK.

08:20.601 --> 08:23.537
LOOK, I'D LIKE CARL
TO BE MORE ROMANTIC,

08:23.604 --> 08:26.807
BUT I CAN'T FORCE IT
OUT OF HIM.

08:28.909 --> 08:32.045
YOU KNOW, HE USED
TO SEND ME FLOWERS

08:32.112 --> 08:33.847
FOR NO REASON AT ALL,

08:33.914 --> 08:37.484
AND HE'D LEAVE ME FUNNY LITTLE
NOTES AROUND THE HOUSE.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.853
HE'D EVEN CALL ME
FOUR TIMES A DAY

08:39.920 --> 08:41.288
JUST TO SAY
HE LOVED ME.

08:44.558 --> 08:47.160
HE DOESN'T DO
THOSE THINGS ANYMORE.

08:47.227 --> 08:51.131
WELL, HARRIETTE, DOESN'T
THAT MAKE YOU ANGRY?

08:51.198 --> 08:53.133
NO.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.535
IT MAKES ME SCARED.

GO ANYWHERE.

STEVE, DID YOU EAT
THAT MOLDY CHEESE?

13:17.530 --> 13:19.199
DON'T HOLD BACK.

13:19.266 --> 13:21.068
LET YOURSELF GO.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.271
DO WHAT YOU FEEL.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.078
OOH! I FELT
THE EARTH MOVE.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.916
STEVE, WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GRADE
EACH OTHER ON THIS ASSIGNMENT,

13:35.983 --> 13:39.019
AND RIGHT NOW YOU'RE STARING
DOWN THE BARREL OF AN "F."

13:40.020 --> 13:42.789
ONE KISS.
A PECK ON THE CHEEK.

13:42.856 --> 13:46.359
A MOMENTARY
OSCULATION.

13:46.426 --> 13:48.996
I HAVE A HEADACHE.

13:49.062 --> 13:52.432
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT SAY THAT,
SO I CAME PREPARED.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.001
ASPIRIN, BABY.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.373
STEVE,
I WANT A DIVORCE.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.442
GO HOME TO YOUR MOTHER.

14:03.810 --> 14:06.346
MY MANLY ARDOR
HAS FRIGHTENED YOU.

14:13.153 --> 14:15.255
THAT'S OKAY. IT
WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

14:15.322 --> 14:18.691
I'M PREPARED TO WAIT
FOREVER IF NEED BE.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.727
I HOPE YOU'LL
ACCEPT THIS GIFT

14:20.793 --> 14:24.064
AS A MEMENTO OF OUR
TWO GLORIOUS WEEKS.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.636
STEVE, THIS IS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.471
1/3 KARAT DIAMOND

14:31.538 --> 14:34.975
WITH 1/10 THE SPARKLE
OF YOUR LOVELY EYES.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.747
THIS IS REAL? WHERE DID YOU
GET THE MONEY?

14:40.813 --> 14:42.015
FROM MY
STAY-AWAY FUND.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.816
EVERY YEAR, MY RELATIVES
SEND MONEY

14:43.883 --> 14:46.053
IN HOPE THAT I
WON'T VISIT THEM.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.357
STEVE,
I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.791
IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE.

14:51.858 --> 14:53.426
BUT MY
LITTLE BAGUETTE,

14:53.493 --> 14:56.029
IT WAS A MERE $800.

14:56.096 --> 14:59.632
$800? ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?

14:59.699 --> 15:01.234
THIS IS
A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT.

15:01.301 --> 15:03.636
IT'S PRETEND.
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.638
WE'RE NOT
EVEN DATING,

15:05.705 --> 15:07.540
AND WE NEVER
WILL BE.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.575
BUT I THOUGHT
YOU'D LIKE--

15:08.641 --> 15:11.678
WHAT I'D LIKE IS FOR YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

15:23.023 --> 15:26.893
LAURA, I KNOW
I'M NOT WORTHY OF YOU,

15:26.960 --> 15:29.896
BUT I JUST CAN'T
HELP LOVING YOU.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.299
IT'S LIKE WANTING
TO TOUCH A STAR.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.467
YOU KNOW YOU'LL
NEVER REACH IT,

15:34.534 --> 15:37.237
BUT YOU'VE JUST
GOT TO KEEP TRYING.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.478
STEVE,

15:45.545 --> 15:49.182
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS
SAY THINGS LIKE THAT?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.219
THESE LAST TWO WEEKS
HAVE BEEN WONDERFUL FOR ME.

15:52.285 --> 15:55.522
IT'S THE CLOSEST I'LL EVER GET
TO MARRYING YOU.

15:55.588 --> 15:58.291
THAT'S WHY I WANTED YOU
TO HAVE THIS.

15:58.358 --> 16:02.029
NO STRINGS ATTACHED.
JUST THE ONE TO MY HEART.

16:16.843 --> 16:17.977
BUSY, MOM?

16:18.045 --> 16:21.648
NO. JUST PRUNING
YOUR FATHER...

16:21.714 --> 16:23.350
FERN.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.852
SOMETHING
ON YOUR MIND?

16:25.918 --> 16:27.187
YEAH. STEVE.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.955
HE DID A GOOD JOB
ON MY OVEN.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.791
TELL HIM WE'RE
OUT OF EASY-OFF.

16:31.858 --> 16:33.626
I CAN'T.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.495
HE JUST WENT HOME.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.632
MOM, I THINK
I HURT STEVE'S FEELINGS.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.902
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.704
HE'S SMOTHERING ME.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.973
HE SENT ME
A ROOMFUL OF ROSES.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.675
HE CALLS ME EVERY HOUR.

16:48.741 --> 16:50.477
HE WAITS ON ME
HAND AND FOOT.

16:50.543 --> 16:53.846
A PERSON CAN ONLY TAKE
SO MUCH DEVOTION.

16:53.913 --> 16:56.183
YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW LUCKY YOU ARE.

16:56.249 --> 16:58.585
STEVE MAY NOT BE
YOUR DREAM MAN,

16:58.651 --> 17:02.055
BUT IT'S WONDERFUL WHEN SOMEBODY
LOVES YOU THAT MUCH.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.494
MOM, HE SENT ME
AN 8-FOOT GIRAFFE.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.232
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.936
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.606
BUT YOU GOT TO
ADMIT ONE THING--

17:19.672 --> 17:23.009
STEVE SURE NEVER
TAKES YOU FOR GRANTED.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.677
I WISH HE WOULD.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.779
I'M ALL URKELED OUT.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.216
WELL...

17:29.282 --> 17:31.251
STEVE IS A PEST.

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.188
BUT HE ADORES YOU, LAURA,

17:35.255 --> 17:36.889
AND HE SHOWS IT.

17:36.956 --> 17:40.293
BEING ROMANTIC IS A GOOD QUALITY
FOR A HUSBAND TO HAVE.

17:51.871 --> 17:56.276
MARK HEALY IS SELFISH,
CONCEITED, AND INCONSIDERATE.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.779
HE CHEATED ON ME

17:59.846 --> 18:03.383
WITH
AN OLDER WOMAN.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.652
I CAUGHT HIM AT THE MOVIES
WITH A NINTH GRADER,

18:06.853 --> 18:09.356
SO I DIVORCED HIM.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.259
MARK, I GIVE YOU
AN F-MINUS.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.264
WELL...

18:17.330 --> 18:20.733
WE'VE LEARNED THAT
NOT EVERYONE IS COMPATIBLE.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.669
BUT I'M GLAD TO SEE
MAXINE AND MARK

18:22.735 --> 18:25.872
HAVE RESOLVED THEIR
DIFFERENCES MATURELY.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.743
JERK!

18:30.810 --> 18:32.145
DWEEB!

18:33.680 --> 18:37.950
ALRIGHT. LET'S MOVE ON
TO OUR LAST COUPLE.

18:38.017 --> 18:41.554
OH. STEVEN,
YOU MAY BEGIN.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.696
OBVIOUSLY, LAURA
WAS THE PERFECT WIFE,

18:49.762 --> 18:53.132
BRILLIANT MOTHER,
HELPMATE, AND MANAGER.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.434
I'LL ALWAYS BE PROUD

18:54.501 --> 18:55.902
SHE WAS THE FIRST
MRS. URKEL.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.174
SHE'S AN "A"
ALL THE WAY.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.377
THANK YOU.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.215
LAURA, YOUR GRADE
FOR STEVEN.

19:15.488 --> 19:16.789
WELL...

19:18.225 --> 19:23.263
STEVE IS INCREDIBLY
ANNOYING AND A PEST.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.633
WELL, YOU JUST WANT TO
SLAP HIM ALL THE TIME.

19:30.403 --> 19:35.742
BUT HE'S ALSO
HARD-WORKING AND CARING.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.779
HE REALLY TRIED
TO MAKE ME HAPPY.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.980
HE WAS A GOOD HUSBAND.

19:41.047 --> 19:43.250
I GAVE HIM AN "A+."

19:45.985 --> 19:48.321
SNOOKUMS!

19:49.856 --> 19:51.824
YOU DO LOVE ME.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.563
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

20:04.571 --> 20:05.738
HI, HON.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.976
DO I KNOW YOU?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.712
OKAY.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.381
I DESERVE THAT.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.717
HARRIETTE, LAST NIGHT...

20:19.419 --> 20:22.555
WELL, I OVERHEARD
YOU TALKING TO LAURA.

20:22.622 --> 20:25.057
AND WHAT YOU SAID TO HER,

20:25.124 --> 20:26.158
IT MADE ME REALIZE

20:26.225 --> 20:28.995
THAT I'VE BEEN ACTING
LIKE A JERK,

20:29.061 --> 20:31.764
AN IDIOT, A FOOL,
AN IGNORAMUS.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.501
STOP ME WHENEVER
YOU LIKE, HARRIETTE.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.438
OH, NO,
YOU'RE DOING FINE.

20:39.606 --> 20:44.210
HARRIETTE, YOU ARE
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON

20:44.277 --> 20:46.279
IN THE WORLD TO ME,

20:46.346 --> 20:48.481
AND YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.784
I THANK GOD EVERYDAY
THAT WE'RE TOGETHER.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.654
BUT NOW IT'S TIME I START
THANKING YOU.

20:58.691 --> 21:01.828
I WANT YOU TO PUT ON
THAT BEAUTIFUL NEW DRESS

21:01.894 --> 21:05.865
BECAUSE WE HAVE AN 8:00
RESERVATION AT CHEZ JOSEPHINE'S.

21:05.932 --> 21:09.168
AND, SWEETHEART,
WHEN YOU WALK IN THERE,

21:09.235 --> 21:11.471
I'D LIKE YOU TO WEAR THIS.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.475
OH, CARL.

21:17.477 --> 21:20.547
IT'S A LITTLE
"I LOVE YOU" PRESENT.

21:21.914 --> 21:23.683
OH, CARL.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.285
THANK YOU.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.522
BUT, SWEETHEART,

21:29.589 --> 21:32.525
NOT AS BEAUTIFUL AS YOU.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.298
OOH. SPARKLE CITY!

21:42.234 --> 21:45.338
I KNOW I SHOULDN'T ASK,
BUT HOW MUCH?

21:45.405 --> 21:48.040
WELL, I GOT A GOOD DEAL.

21:48.107 --> 21:50.643
I BOUGHT IT OFF URKEL.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.280
HE TRIED TO BARGAIN,

21:54.347 --> 21:56.048
BUT THE KID
WAS OVERMATCHED.

21:56.115 --> 21:59.452
HE CAVED IN AT 1,000.

21:59.519 --> 22:03.490
OOH, CARL,
THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.992
BUT HE THREW IN A LITTLE
SOMETHING EXTRA.

22:11.464 --> 22:14.367
[STRANGERS IN
THE NIGHT PLAYS]

22:31.884 --> 22:34.454
WORTH EVERY PENNY.
