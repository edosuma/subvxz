WEBVTT

00:20.813 --> 00:22.273
Can you keep
the wallowing down?

00:22.273 --> 00:23.858
Can you keep
the homeschooling down?

00:23.858 --> 00:26.152
Justin, if I don't find
some environmental super-job,

00:26.152 --> 00:28.779
my parents will find out my
entire summer has been a lie,

00:28.779 --> 00:31.198
- and my life is over.
- Billie, my life IS over.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.409
I got dumped, I got exiled
from my family cottage,

00:33.409 --> 00:34.785
and now
my sweet daughter,

00:34.785 --> 00:36.245
who should be
going on a chip run

00:36.245 --> 00:37.997
for her
unjustly accused bio-pop,

00:37.997 --> 00:40.249
is obsessing over her CV,
on her summer vacation.

00:40.249 --> 00:41.792
Well, I just got
my boating license

00:41.792 --> 00:43.002
and hunting safety certification.

00:43.002 --> 00:44.378
This could change
the game for me.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.796
All right,
I didn't want to do this,

00:45.796 --> 00:47.631
but you've left me
no choice.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.592
- Who are you texting?
- Maisy invited us to dinner,

00:49.592 --> 00:51.218
and we're going.
I need snacks,

00:51.218 --> 00:52.803
and you need
to chill the fuck out.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.680
But I still have
my wayfinding exam!

00:54.680 --> 00:56.432
Well, I hate to pull
the "dead dad" card here,

00:56.432 --> 00:58.309
but it is the anniversary
of my dad's death,

00:58.309 --> 01:00.770
and Maisy wants to celebrate
his life by spreading his ashes.

01:00.770 --> 01:02.521
Where? The outhouse?
You hated him.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.648
Yeah, but I didn't hate
his favourite foods.

01:04.648 --> 01:08.194
Pigs in a blanket,
Nana's bean dip, Dirty Bananas.

01:08.194 --> 01:10.488
- Huh?
- It's a delicious rum cocktail

01:10.488 --> 01:12.573
that's gonna take
Mama's mind off work.

01:12.573 --> 01:15.326
Okay, well, Mama is underaged
and needs a job!

01:15.326 --> 01:17.161
Oh, Maisy can help
with that.

01:17.161 --> 01:19.205
She probably knows some, like,
obnoxious greenfluencer

01:19.205 --> 01:21.373
who can hook you up.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.507
Fine. I'll go.

01:29.507 --> 01:31.425
- Yeah?
- If Maisy can get me a job.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.427
Just wait till you get
a Dirty Banana in your mouth.

01:33.427 --> 01:34.678
- Ugh.
- Heard it!

01:34.678 --> 01:37.139
Too late to stop it.

01:38.307 --> 01:39.558
Hello!

01:40.267 --> 01:41.852
Why'd you bring
those fruit turds?

01:41.852 --> 01:43.813
'Cause you never come
to a dinner empty-handed.

01:43.813 --> 01:45.523
Plus, every time
I go to Gas 'n Go,

01:45.523 --> 01:47.650
they spit in my slushie.
Marcus smokes,

01:47.650 --> 01:49.276
- and I can taste it.
- Ew.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.111
Thank you so much
for coming.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.404
Dad would've been
so happy.

01:53.239 --> 01:55.074
Except for the part
where he's dead.

02:03.249 --> 02:05.251
- Oh, baby.
- Oh.

02:05.251 --> 02:07.962
I know how hard
today is for you.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.047
Uh, um,

02:10.047 --> 02:11.215
we brought dates.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.343
I didn't think
today could get any sadder.

02:14.343 --> 02:16.470
Mom, why don't you and Billie
sit down and relax,

02:16.470 --> 02:18.597
and Justin and I
can finish up in the kitchen?

02:18.597 --> 02:21.267
Perfect.
We can arrange the shrine.

02:21.267 --> 02:23.185
- Help me!
- I'm sorry.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.562
Mmm, my God.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.815
- Where's Opal and Victor?
- In the city.

02:28.399 --> 02:30.734
Opal took Derrick's death
really hard.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.361
He wore black
for six months.

02:32.361 --> 02:34.071
Oh, hey.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.281
Do you know
any environmental CEO types

02:35.281 --> 02:36.657
who'd be willing
to hire a student?

02:36.657 --> 02:38.242
'Cause Billie
really needs a job.

02:38.242 --> 02:39.493
What happened
to tree planting?

02:39.493 --> 02:40.452
Didn't pan out.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.746
I was so caught up
with Riley,

02:42.746 --> 02:44.665
I completely missed
that she was flailing.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.292
- I can make some calls.
- Yeah?

02:46.292 --> 02:47.126
For a favour.

02:50.045 --> 02:52.548
We talking smuggling, fraud,
or straight-up extortion?

02:52.548 --> 02:55.217
Get my mom to admit
she burnt down the Boathouse.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.219
- Come on, Maisy.
- You were right,

02:57.219 --> 02:59.013
there is an arsonist among us.
It's my mother.

02:59.013 --> 03:00.848
The quads' footage
proves it.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.267
No, I already told you,
I am done playing with fire.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.060
The only reason that I even

03:05.060 --> 03:07.146
came over here tonight was
to try and get Billie a job.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.439
She stayed
on the lake for me...

03:08.439 --> 03:09.690
And got fired
on your watch.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.191
So if you want me
to help Billie,

03:11.191 --> 03:13.110
help me prove
my mom set the fire.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.571
Think about it.

03:16.113 --> 03:19.283
Mom only said that she was dying
after you announced the wedding.

03:19.283 --> 03:21.160
Then, she made Jayne
get the Boathouse

03:21.160 --> 03:23.245
for the ceremony,
then she sneaks in

03:23.245 --> 03:24.622
wearing someone else's shirt

03:24.622 --> 03:26.165
just before
the fireworks go off!

03:26.165 --> 03:28.250
All to get the payout
from the land sale.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.085
Do you have any proof?

03:30.085 --> 03:31.462
I will with a confession,

03:31.462 --> 03:33.213
and your messy
drama queen energy

03:33.213 --> 03:34.506
is our best shot
at getting one.

03:34.506 --> 03:35.966
Mimsy does love a spectacle.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.885
The conditions
couldn't be more perfect.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.637
It's the anniversary
of Dad's death,

03:39.637 --> 03:41.388
and in a low light,
you share a passing,

03:41.388 --> 03:43.140
anemic resemblance
to Derrick.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.975
With Billie here,
my mom might actually feel guilt

03:44.975 --> 03:46.185
for the first time
in her life.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.105
Oh, God, I don't know.
I don't know, Maisy.

03:50.105 --> 03:52.650
The last time
that I did this, Riley left.

03:53.192 --> 03:54.944
Prove that it's arson,

03:54.944 --> 03:56.528
and the board gets
the insurance money

03:56.528 --> 03:58.697
and the payout.
Riley comes home to a hero.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.032
What's in it for you?

04:00.908 --> 04:02.910
Ammunition to blackmail
my mother with.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.203
She hands over
the cottage to me

04:04.203 --> 04:05.913
and is out
of my life forever.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.998
I feel like I should
just float the idea

04:07.998 --> 04:10.376
of family therapy
as an option before blackmail.

04:10.376 --> 04:11.543
Think of Billie.

04:11.543 --> 04:13.587
I know DiCaprio's people,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.673
and they work
with baby sea turtles.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.220
Fine. I'll do it.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.138
For Billie.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.141
For all the leftovers.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.685
Are you sure
you want to eat mayonnaise?

04:27.685 --> 04:30.187
I don't know.

04:31.313 --> 04:34.817
<i>♪ Daytime rider ♪</i>

04:34.817 --> 04:38.737
<i>♪ Ridin' on a lonely trail ♪</i>

04:38.737 --> 04:42.449
<i>♪ Waitin' for the day...</i>

04:42.449 --> 04:44.868
Derrick's been dead
for eight years,

04:44.868 --> 04:48.414
and I've had so many
more creative lovers since,

04:48.414 --> 04:49.915
but I still do miss him.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.917
I wish you could have met.

04:52.876 --> 04:54.003
Yeah, what was he like?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.923
A lot like Justin.
He was always running.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.343
Doctors called it
marathon training,

05:01.343 --> 05:03.804
but who needs
to put 42 kilometres

05:03.804 --> 05:05.305
between them
and their wife?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.018
How's your
intern thingy going?

05:09.018 --> 05:09.893
Uh...

05:10.894 --> 05:13.689
I actually decided to stay here
and plant trees instead,

05:14.273 --> 05:18.235
- but, um, I was let go.
- Oh, yeah.

05:18.235 --> 05:22.156
I've been "let go"
heaps of times.

05:22.156 --> 05:24.116
But I always managed
to turn it my way

05:24.116 --> 05:25.826
or into a settlement.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.830
If you're short,
I could loan you some cash

05:29.830 --> 05:31.540
after I get my cut
of the Boathouse sale.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.751
It's not the money.
It's my parents.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.795
- If they find out...
- Hopefully they're air signs.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.422
Oh.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.053
Job didn't come through?

05:44.678 --> 05:46.180
Not quite yet.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.806
Shall we find out when?

05:51.685 --> 05:54.980
Hi. Dirty Banana
to celebrate Daddy Deadest.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.566
Oh, I only drink
Angel Tits now,

05:57.566 --> 05:59.443
to give me a taste
of what's to come.

05:59.443 --> 06:03.280
What's the day, time, and place
of Billie's birth?

06:03.280 --> 06:04.114
You were there.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.408
Yeah,
but you weren't keeping her.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.826
I didn't wanna
over-invest.

06:07.826 --> 06:10.370
- Have you seen my iPad?
- Uh...

06:10.370 --> 06:12.456
I wanna do
Billie's birth chart.

06:15.793 --> 06:16.627
Uh, why?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.838
Because she's 50% you,

06:19.838 --> 06:24.093
and I think if I show her
that she's starred unluckily,

06:24.093 --> 06:25.385
might take the sting out.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.433
- God, this day, right?
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.186
So brutal.
Just comes in big ol' waves.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.771
I miss your dad too, hon.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.356
No, it's not that.
It's just the...

06:37.356 --> 06:39.149
- Oh, Billie getting fired?
- No, it's...

06:39.149 --> 06:41.193
- Riley leaving for good?
- No, uh...

06:41.193 --> 06:42.694
That you can't form
lasting relationships

06:42.694 --> 06:44.154
'cause you're in love
with your own trauma?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.697
- No! It...
- Well, then spit it out.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.163
They've been looking
into the Boathouse fire,

06:53.163 --> 06:55.290
and the authorities
suspect arson,

06:55.290 --> 06:57.876
and all the evidence, Mimsy,
it all points to me.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.670
It's crazy.
Like, I'm being set up.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.797
Well,
your eyes are shifty,

07:01.797 --> 07:03.507
and your posture's
very loose.

07:03.507 --> 07:05.300
I didn't do it!
I'm innocent.

07:05.300 --> 07:07.010
And, like, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.221
I can't go to jail,
and I can't lose any more time

07:09.221 --> 07:11.598
with Billie, I just got
her back into my life.

07:12.141 --> 07:13.350
You won't have to.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.353
- I did it.
- You did?

07:18.397 --> 07:20.858
- How was I? Convincing?
- Very.

07:20.858 --> 07:23.193
Perfect.
Call the authorities!

07:23.819 --> 07:25.445
Wait... I should call
the authorities

07:25.445 --> 07:27.197
- because you did it?
- Happy to say I did.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.365
Because you did.

07:28.365 --> 07:29.908
That's what
I'll tell the fuzz.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.995
So you'll say
you did do it,

07:32.995 --> 07:34.955
but you didn't do it,
or you did do it, but...

07:34.955 --> 07:36.248
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.709
Arson is not worth
the dermal distress.

07:39.585 --> 07:41.295
But even if I didn't burn down
the Boathouse,

07:41.295 --> 07:43.547
I am happy
to be your fall gal.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.424
I'll be dead
before it gets to trial.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.887
But I do want Opal to note
my bravery in his eulogy.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.472
I want Lily James
for my biopic.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.683
She was tremendous
as Pamela Anderson.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.311
Yeah, maybe we'll just wait
for the fuzz to make their move.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.730
You should think
about confessing.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.399
Prison would be
great for you.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.942
- You'd finally get in shape.
- What?

08:03.942 --> 08:05.277
Meet someone.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.738
Do you prefer
the top or bottom bunk?

08:07.738 --> 08:09.489
Don't know, depends on
what I ate that morning.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.251
Need help with anything?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.587
Can you help bury my mother
and bring my son back?

08:24.254 --> 08:25.464
Heh. I'm kidding.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.719
So, uh, how is Killian doing?

08:30.719 --> 08:33.013
He's interning with
Hong Kong's Naomi Campbell.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.765
If all goes well,
he may end up in Milan

08:34.765 --> 08:36.308
- for Fashion Week.
- Wow.

08:36.308 --> 08:37.851
Yeah, no, that's cool.
Cool, cool.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.686
Internships
are just cool, right?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.313
How many did you beat
to get yours

08:41.313 --> 08:42.814
at the National
Climate Institute?

08:42.814 --> 08:44.483
Oh, you know,
it was just, like...

08:45.275 --> 08:46.985
- nationwide.
- Oh.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.029
The runner-up really
owes you a gift basket.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.490
I know it seems weird
to give up a killer internship

08:51.490 --> 08:53.408
to plant trees,
but deforestation is real,

08:53.408 --> 08:55.244
and I wanted to make
a difference this summer.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.370
By getting fired?

08:56.995 --> 08:58.789
Well, lucky for you,
I have been consulting

08:58.789 --> 09:00.749
for a carbon-neutral
swag bag startup,

09:00.749 --> 09:03.043
and they could always use
some help. Is that my mom's?

09:03.043 --> 09:05.420
- Yeah, she didn't do it.
- Didn't do what?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.839
Billie, could you please
give this back to her?

09:07.839 --> 09:08.715
Yeah.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.431
Mom played you.
Go. Try again.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.600
No, Maisy, she didn't.
Listen for yourself.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.519
That woman is
practically an angel.

09:20.519 --> 09:22.271
She was ready
to be my fall guy.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.357
So what's Billie gonna do
with Leo's sea turtles, anyway?

09:25.357 --> 09:27.776
Is she gonna teach 'em to swim,
or teach 'em how to avoid soup?

09:27.776 --> 09:30.195
Nope, no confession means
no Leo for Billie,

09:30.195 --> 09:31.405
and no mayonnaise salad
for you.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.198
But my dad died today!

09:33.198 --> 09:35.367
Oh, please, you didn't even
come back for the funeral.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.868
You didn't send
a save the date!

09:36.868 --> 09:38.578
Because it was a funeral,
and I ended up

09:38.578 --> 09:40.789
having to do everything myself,
like always.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.582
I guess I'm gonna have to
get this confession myself.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.543
Oh, lord, Maisy,
the woman is dying.

09:44.543 --> 09:47.546
She's literally dying.
There is no long con.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.464
Mimsy doesn't have the time
or attention span.

09:49.464 --> 09:50.674
Enough with the Nancy Drew.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.092
Sweater sets
have frumped you out.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.885
From the guy
who spent half the summer

09:53.885 --> 09:56.388
playing <i>CSI: Muskoka</i>
to get his boyfriend back.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.807
I was trying
to bring the Boathouse back

09:58.807 --> 10:00.475
to make Riley want me back.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.269
Learn from my selfless example,

10:02.269 --> 10:04.271
and stop trying to steal
a cottage from a dying woman.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.606
From the guy who tried
to steal it from me last summer.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.609
Oh, my God,
you are so impossible!

10:09.609 --> 10:12.112
Screw Leo, I'm gonna
find Billie a job myself.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.780
- Okay.
- I know people!

10:13.780 --> 10:15.824
Take your diabetic raisins
and go.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.534
No!
I'm not going anywhere.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.870
Billie and I are gonna
mourn my dad the right way.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.705
We are gonna eat
this mayonnaise salad,

10:21.705 --> 10:23.832
we are gonna drink
those dirty-ass bananas,

10:23.832 --> 10:25.417
and we are gonna
spread his ashes

10:25.417 --> 10:26.960
in the outhouse
where they belong,

10:26.960 --> 10:28.545
and we are gonna
have a great time

10:28.545 --> 10:30.088
while we do it!

10:30.088 --> 10:32.215
This is
just stimulating.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.925
Explain it to me. Slowly.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.844
Even though
Billie's birth chart

10:35.844 --> 10:38.388
puts her Sun in Capricorn,
she has to be very careful...

10:38.388 --> 10:40.140
Because I'm a Taurus rising.
Right?...

10:40.140 --> 10:42.476
Which is very easy
for the bullheadedness

10:42.476 --> 10:44.061
to trigger
the impulsiveness.

10:44.061 --> 10:46.188
Yes, but that I get
from being an Aries Moon.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.981
Why is that so funny?

10:47.981 --> 10:52.319
Billie is a Capricorn,
Aries, and Taurus.

10:52.319 --> 10:56.531
Sea goat. Bull. Ram.
You guys, all horns!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.158
She's horny!

10:59.576 --> 11:01.703
Uh, have you been drinking that
this whole time?

11:01.703 --> 11:03.663
Mama needed
a little pick-me-up.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.207
She's underage, Mom.

11:05.207 --> 11:08.251
Ugh. A Canadian 17
is a European six,

11:08.251 --> 11:10.754
when they introduce drinking
to children responsibly.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.589
Mmm, yeah, did you poison that
or something?

11:12.589 --> 11:14.174
Poison a drink
meant for my mother?

11:14.174 --> 11:15.050
Wait, that does track.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.553
She did spike my coffee
with cream last summer

11:18.553 --> 11:19.888
even though
she knew I had EBS.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.681
The only poison
in that drink is rum.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.351
Nope, not buyin' it.
You're gonna have to drink that.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.644
Ugh, fine.

11:28.480 --> 11:30.107
- Happy?
- No!

11:30.107 --> 11:32.401
My daughter is dangerously
inebriated and all hopped up

11:32.401 --> 11:34.820
on a lethal concoction of
caffeine and rum, and we should

11:34.820 --> 11:36.571
probably go detox at home.
Billie, come on, let's go.

11:36.571 --> 11:38.198
But it's storming out!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.783
We're stormin' out!

11:42.536 --> 11:44.996
That said, electrocution
might solve my problems.

11:44.996 --> 11:49.376
Wait! No. No one is leaving
until the storm is over.

11:49.376 --> 11:53.171
Now, let's get
the ceremony started.

11:53.171 --> 11:54.965
Tonight's about Derrick,

11:54.965 --> 11:57.467
not your vagina monologues, Justin.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.594
It's been a hard day
for all of us.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.722
Why don't we start
by each sharing a memory of Dad?

12:03.348 --> 12:05.142
Okay. I'll start.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.394
Oh, no, no, no. You don't
have to be strong for us.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.146
Let me carry
this burden for you.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.065
Dad died so suddenly,

12:12.065 --> 12:14.359
he never got
to clear his conscience.

12:14.359 --> 12:16.403
But I know he would
want that for all of us

12:16.403 --> 12:17.529
before it's too late.

12:18.655 --> 12:21.700
Mom, it's no secret
you had a wandering heart,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.118
and Dad did too.

12:24.161 --> 12:27.956
I apologize for the many,
many, many, many,

12:27.956 --> 12:32.419
many, many summer flings
he had at the Boathouse.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.087
I know that's why
you burnt it down.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.089
Oh, God! Maisy.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.674
The woman is innocent.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.384
Why is this so hard
for you to believe?

12:39.384 --> 12:42.012
I just want her to die
with a clear conscience.

12:42.012 --> 12:43.805
I'm a two-timer, too!
I kissed two people.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.390
I just can't help
my horny energy, okay?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.017
I once made out
with an entire cricket team.

12:47.017 --> 12:48.685
- It's all right. Relax.
- Okay.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.605
Why do you think I burnt down
the Boathouse, Maisykins?

12:51.605 --> 12:53.106
The quads filmed you
going back in

12:53.106 --> 12:54.065
just before it caught fire.

12:55.066 --> 12:59.404
Oh. There is no investigation
to the fire, is there?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.281
She put me up to it!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.158
She's the one that thinks
you burned down the Boathouse

13:03.158 --> 13:04.534
- for a payout.
- You were wearing

13:04.534 --> 13:06.495
Claire's plaid,
the same plaid as Riley,

13:06.495 --> 13:08.038
because you thought
it would protect you

13:08.038 --> 13:09.873
from detection,
just like you think

13:09.873 --> 13:11.541
that dying
from a mysterious illness

13:11.541 --> 13:13.210
protects you
from suspicion.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.504
Fine! You caught me.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.547
Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:18.340 --> 13:19.716
I went back

13:19.716 --> 13:21.551
into the Boathouse...

13:25.680 --> 13:28.767
...to get the Vitamix
I gave Justin for his wedding.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.644
That's my Vitamix
in the kitchen?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.854
A wedding present for a wedding
that didn't happen.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.564
- Almost!
- Wait, wait! That's true.

13:34.564 --> 13:36.024
I saw her outside
the Boathouse with it.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.692
And a duvet. SodaStream.

13:37.692 --> 13:40.570
- Air fryer. Fondue set...
- Enough confessing now, sweets.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.031
Did she put you up to this
with her star witch bullshit?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.659
God, Maisy, stop! No!
Your mother is a lot of things.

13:45.659 --> 13:49.120
She's a thief, and she's a liar,
but she's not magic!

13:49.120 --> 13:51.039
And as much as
we all want it to be true,

13:51.039 --> 13:52.999
nobody burned down
the Boathouse.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.294
It was an accident.
It was a really awful accident.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.171
We all need to stop
running from the truth.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.134
We all run.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.972
Oh, my God,
I think I'm having an epiphany.

14:10.433 --> 14:13.687
You ran from me
when I came out

14:13.687 --> 14:15.230
and I gave Billie up,

14:15.230 --> 14:17.774
and now I run
from everyone who loves me

14:17.774 --> 14:19.859
so that they don't have to
run from me first!

14:19.859 --> 14:22.737
Oh, my God,
that's why I ran from Riley!

14:22.737 --> 14:24.614
I'm so wise!

14:24.614 --> 14:27.325
We need to go to the outhouse.
We gotta spread his ashes now.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.828
The only thing that is
spreading here is bullshit.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.580
Okay, maybe you didn't
burn down the Boathouse,

14:31.580 --> 14:33.290
but you are not
sick and dying,

14:33.290 --> 14:34.874
and you have to
stop hiding that!

14:34.874 --> 14:36.376
Maisy, as someone
who's done the work

14:36.376 --> 14:38.253
to resolve
deep parental trauma...

14:38.253 --> 14:40.130
- Twenty seconds ago?
- Long enough to know

14:40.130 --> 14:42.716
that you need to release
your mom like I released my dad.

14:44.092 --> 14:46.261
Dad stays in the bottle
until I get the truth!

14:46.261 --> 14:47.887
Well, the truth is that
you bottle everything up.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.556
I do not bottle
everything up!

14:49.556 --> 14:51.391
When she was nine,
she kept her appendix

14:51.391 --> 14:52.892
from bursting for hours.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.061
Because I was waiting
for you to take me

14:55.061 --> 14:57.147
- to the hospital.
- I left money for a cab!

14:57.147 --> 14:59.649
Maisy, this is your thing.
You just keep everything inside

14:59.649 --> 15:01.735
until one day,
it just, pfft, explodes.

15:01.735 --> 15:04.362
Exactly. That's why
her appendix burst.

15:04.362 --> 15:06.156
You're blaming me
for that?

15:06.156 --> 15:09.242
I'm just saying, you might
still have one if you just,

15:09.242 --> 15:11.578
you know, swallowed your pride
and let things go.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.997
Swallow my pride? Easy.

15:13.997 --> 15:16.041
I have been swallowing
your shit for years.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.336
You wanna see me let go?
Bottom's up, bitches!

15:19.336 --> 15:20.420
Dad!

15:25.216 --> 15:27.302
Not your dad.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.013
Did you just eat
Grandpa Derrick?

15:34.142 --> 15:35.810
It's Victor's protein powder.

15:36.728 --> 15:38.229
You lied about his ashes?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.649
And about poisoning
your drinks.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.400
It's spiked with
Mom's kava kava.

15:42.400 --> 15:44.319
- Kava kava?
- Kava kava?

15:44.319 --> 15:47.280
Just a mild psychoactive
that I use for pain management.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.990
Makes her super chatty.

15:48.990 --> 15:51.117
I thought it would help you
get a confession.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.453
Oh, you should've
cut it with hash!

15:53.453 --> 15:55.747
I can't believe
you poisoned me again.

15:55.747 --> 15:57.332
You? What about me?

15:57.332 --> 15:58.708
You were supposed
to get me a job,

15:58.708 --> 15:59.876
and instead
I've been drugged.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.295
We all make whoopsies.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.882
Do you know
I once casually asked someone

16:05.882 --> 16:08.802
if Maisy slept with Derrick
to get the cottage?

16:08.802 --> 16:11.221
And that rumour went crazy.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.806
What?

16:12.806 --> 16:15.433
Oh,
that's where that came from.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.645
Well, it looks good.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.147
The outage
must be lake-wide.

16:21.147 --> 16:22.691
All right, well,
we should probably

16:22.691 --> 16:24.484
- fire up the generator.
- No, no.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.444
As soon as they see light,
the neighbours will be over

16:26.444 --> 16:28.113
asking to store
their weird freezer meat.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.115
- Ew.
- Check those boxes

16:30.115 --> 16:32.325
for flashlights. My mom
keeps moving everything.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.954
You haven't seen where
your mom moved a fondue set

16:35.954 --> 16:37.247
or a duvet cover, did...

16:37.789 --> 16:39.332
yeah, right,
we can talk about that later.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.442
Well, I like your style.

17:06.109 --> 17:08.653
Ignoring them.
Keeps them hungry.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.488
I can't do it
for much longer.

17:10.488 --> 17:11.406
Sure you can.

17:12.115 --> 17:14.909
I once kept Murakami
and Johnny Ramone

17:14.909 --> 17:16.828
on tenterhooks for a month
with the promise

17:16.828 --> 17:18.913
of a clandestine trip
to Majorca.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.999
Yeah, well,
they weren't brother and sister.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.960
I can see
how that could get icky.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.338
How am I supposed to pick one
without hurting the other?

17:28.089 --> 17:31.509
Following your heart
can leave casualties.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.012
Good or bad,
that's the fun.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.389
What's not fun
is living with regret.

17:37.182 --> 17:39.851
Is that why you confessed to
starting the rumour about Maisy?

17:39.851 --> 17:42.020
I don't regret that.
That taught her how

17:42.020 --> 17:44.314
to rise above
the dumb shit people say,

17:44.314 --> 17:45.482
made her a killer.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.108
Made her insane.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.402
She literally planned
this whole night

17:49.402 --> 17:51.112
just to get you
to confess to a crime

17:51.112 --> 17:52.572
- you didn't even commit.
- Mmm.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.450
You, um,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.536
didn't do it, right?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.708
Wish I did.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.627
Just to make her happy.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.963
Oh, I married a boring doctor

18:08.963 --> 18:11.007
and spent every summer
on this puddle

18:11.007 --> 18:13.051
instead of
touring with The Kinks!

18:13.718 --> 18:16.095
All for her.

18:17.889 --> 18:19.224
What else could she want?

18:19.891 --> 18:21.684
An apology, maybe?

18:23.561 --> 18:25.897
Derrick left the cottage
to his stepdaughter

18:25.897 --> 18:28.942
instead of to his wife.
She should apologize to me.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.903
He left the cottage
to his family.

18:32.445 --> 18:33.988
I think that means you too.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.994
Bovine collagen?

18:39.994 --> 18:41.412
You repping livestock?

18:41.412 --> 18:42.831
It's for Victor's
protein powder.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.708
So where did you end up

18:45.708 --> 18:48.253
sprinkling dear old Dad's
real embers, huh?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.713
Along his favourite
5K on the lake.

18:51.506 --> 18:53.591
Dad did like to manspread.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.635
Ooh, my wedding present!

18:56.553 --> 18:57.846
Oh, hey, um...

18:58.346 --> 18:59.889
um,

18:59.889 --> 19:01.766
are you okay, by the way?

19:01.766 --> 19:04.352
Your mom's
weird rumour thing.

19:05.019 --> 19:07.355
Oh, I should be asking
you the same thing.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.274
Me sleeping with Dad
to get the cottage

19:09.274 --> 19:10.859
was your favourite victim card.

19:10.859 --> 19:12.944
Well, yeah,
but I never believed it.

19:12.944 --> 19:14.904
- I mean, not much.
- Yeah, don't worry about me.

19:14.904 --> 19:17.699
I've spent my life
cleaning up after Mom's lies.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.494
Well, you know, as
someone who's done the work...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.746
- Twenty minutes ago?
- ...I know how hard

19:23.746 --> 19:26.416
it can be to
let go of our stories.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.543
That's the rum
and the kava talking.

19:28.543 --> 19:30.336
We don't judge
the great teachers.

19:30.962 --> 19:32.422
Me looking for an arsonist

19:32.422 --> 19:34.340
was just me looking anywhere
but myself,

19:34.340 --> 19:36.092
and I'm humble enough
to admit...

19:36.092 --> 19:38.052
- High enough.
- ...that if I really want

19:38.052 --> 19:39.345
another shot at love,

19:39.345 --> 19:40.972
I'm gonna have to
work on myself.

19:42.015 --> 19:44.392
I mean,
I blew it with Riley,

19:44.392 --> 19:46.311
but you've still got
a shot with your mom.

19:48.771 --> 19:51.024
You're right!
I did the work.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.276
That's why I'm so much better
than everybody else!

19:53.276 --> 19:54.944
Oh, I think you skipped a step.

19:54.944 --> 19:57.113
I overcame my mother's
rumour to become

19:57.113 --> 19:59.365
the Boathouse's
longest-serving president.

19:59.365 --> 20:01.993
She only has the power
I give her.

20:01.993 --> 20:05.496
It is time for me to take back
what is rightfully mine

20:05.496 --> 20:07.707
and become
the fucking goddess I am.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.084
And she said
"Let there be light!"

20:19.344 --> 20:20.970
I got this for Derrick.

20:20.970 --> 20:23.348
He had the sweat glands
of a Bolivian burro!

20:23.348 --> 20:24.933
He never used it.
Maybe if he had,

20:24.933 --> 20:26.100
he'd be here now.

20:26.976 --> 20:28.478
- I pass it to you.
- Oh.

20:30.188 --> 20:33.274
May it help you
see more clearly when you run.

20:35.693 --> 20:37.445
- It's not your best.
- Ow, ow, ow!

20:37.445 --> 20:39.197
- Just a little bit, it's...
- This was Derrick's.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.032
Use it,

20:41.991 --> 20:43.242
to listen to your heart.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.827
And to Justin's.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.496
Derrick had an arrhythmia.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.331
If his running doesn't get him,
his ticker will.

20:50.917 --> 20:53.002
Well, if only the wizard
had a heart for you.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.464
Oh! Oh, my,
that's in the way.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.591
- How about I move it?
- No, no, no, it's fine,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.843
- I got it, I got it.
- I can call my clients

21:00.843 --> 21:02.679
at Brown Bag Swag tomorrow
about Billie's job.

21:02.679 --> 21:04.514
What about Leo's
baby sea turtles?

21:04.514 --> 21:07.183
Actually, I think I'll just
enjoy the rest of summer.

21:07.183 --> 21:09.143
But thank you,
appreciate it.

21:09.143 --> 21:10.979
Opal hates writing
recommendation letters anyway,

21:10.979 --> 21:11.980
so...

21:13.231 --> 21:15.358
Well!
I guess we should...

21:15.358 --> 21:16.776
Do you wanna grab
that fondue set?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.569
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you so much

21:18.569 --> 21:20.989
for a great night,
and for celebrating Dad

21:20.989 --> 21:22.573
the way that
he would've wanted:

21:22.573 --> 21:24.158
drunk and resentful.

21:24.701 --> 21:25.535
Good night.

21:26.119 --> 21:26.953
Good night.

21:33.543 --> 21:35.128
I've gotta
clean out the fridge.

21:35.128 --> 21:37.088
Whoreen's gonna be here
with a meatloaf from 2011.

21:37.088 --> 21:39.048
I have a present
for you too, darling.

21:40.049 --> 21:40.883
Okay.

21:45.555 --> 21:47.140
I'd like to apologize.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.601
For that rumour I started.
I'm sorry it hurt you.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.020
But if it spread that fast,

21:52.020 --> 21:53.646
people were
probably thinking it.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.649
And I also forgive you
for thinking

21:56.649 --> 21:58.276
I burnt down the Boathouse.

21:58.276 --> 21:59.861
I know you're bummed
because I'm not leaving

21:59.861 --> 22:01.654
in the back of a squad car.

22:01.654 --> 22:04.032
But now you don't have to
waste time on all those people

22:04.032 --> 22:05.992
who thought
you slept with my husband.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.202
We can focus
on what matters.

22:08.202 --> 22:09.120
Me.

22:09.954 --> 22:12.457
- And you.
- There is no "you and me."

22:12.457 --> 22:14.792
There's only you
and what you want.

22:14.792 --> 22:17.128
Maybe your little sick act
convinced the lake

22:17.128 --> 22:20.006
to get rid of the Boathouse,
but I will bring it back.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.800
And I am sick of you
always taking what is mine.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.302
If I learned
one thing from you...

22:25.344 --> 22:26.345
it's how to win.

22:28.306 --> 22:30.308
And Maisy
always fucking wins.

22:37.356 --> 22:38.441
Hmm.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.402
You're sure you're cool
with me bailing on the job?

22:41.944 --> 22:44.572
You kidding me?
Never been prouder.

22:44.572 --> 22:46.824
Working with Maisy
comes with a price.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.409
Usually tax fraud.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.453
What are we gonna
tell your parents, though?

22:50.453 --> 22:52.413
Well, they still think
I'm working for Parks Canada,

22:52.413 --> 22:54.165
so until one
of my job applications

22:54.165 --> 22:56.292
comes through,
we stay quiet.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.045
Or else I'll have another set
of parents running from me.

23:01.214 --> 23:03.174
You know that
you're not the reason

23:03.174 --> 23:05.176
that my dad
ran from me, right?

23:05.176 --> 23:07.678
- We ran from each other.
- I know.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.806
I mean, you were, what,
like, a year older than me?

23:09.806 --> 23:12.517
Physically.
Emotionally? Soft 14.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.772
No more running
from the people I love

23:17.772 --> 23:19.440
just 'cause I'm scared
they'll run from me first.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.609
Unless it's a zombie apocalypse
and they've been bit.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.028
- You wouldn't try to amputate?
- Rookie mistake.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.988
See?
It's what I love about you.

23:25.988 --> 23:28.908
You know when to run, you know
when to stand your ground.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.493
Till it bites me
in the ass.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.495
We don't judge
the great teachers.

23:36.457 --> 23:38.459
- I'm gonna go get the mail.
- Sure.

23:44.006 --> 23:45.800
I would never run from you.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.940
Okay, I haven't figured out what

24:00.940 --> 24:03.526
this weird metal ring thing
is yet, but I did find all

24:03.526 --> 24:05.278
these colour-coded dippers.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.238
We got little individual
containers for all the stuff

24:07.238 --> 24:09.574
that we might wanna dip
in chocolate or cheese

24:09.574 --> 24:11.784
or whatever it is you can
throw through a fondue machine.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.661
I haven't had one of
these since college.

24:13.661 --> 24:15.997
I forget how to use it, but
this ring looks really nice.

24:15.997 --> 24:18.666
It's, like, heavy.
Oh, God, that pot's massive too!

24:18.666 --> 24:20.126
Think about all the things
