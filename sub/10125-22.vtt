WEBVTT

00:12.300 --> 00:13.300
MATTHEWS...

00:13.300 --> 00:14.900
THE TEACHERS
GOT TOGETHER,

00:14.900 --> 00:17.100
AND WE HAVE
A FEW THINGS FOR YOU.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.233
OH, THANKS, GUYS.
GRADUATION GIFT?

00:19.233 --> 00:20.400
CONFISCATION
GIFT.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.734
YOU GET YOUR
STUFF BACK
AS PROMISED.

00:22.734 --> 00:27.000
HEY, MY GIANT
UNDERPANTS!

00:27.000 --> 00:29.033
THESE ALWAYS
GOT A LAUGH.

00:29.033 --> 00:33.133
AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE--
THE FEENY PUPPET.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.700
AW, LITTLE GEORGE!

00:35.700 --> 00:37.800
WE'LL LEAVE
YOU TWO ALONE.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.200
[AS FEENY]
DETENTION, MR. MATTHEWS.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.233
DETENTION, MR. MATTHEWS.

00:47.667 --> 00:51.200
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THIS
RIDICULOUS THING?

00:51.200 --> 00:52.667
IT'S JUST A DUMMY.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.700
I'M NOT TALKING
TO YOU.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.200
YOU'LL MISS ME,
WON'T YOU, MR. FEENY?

00:59.200 --> 01:01.600
WILL I? HAVE
YOU HEARD FROM
MORE COLLEGES?

01:01.600 --> 01:05.033
I GOT TURNED DOWN
FROM PENN STATE AND B.U.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.100
LOOKS LIKE I'LL END UP

01:06.100 --> 01:08.200
AT NORTH SOUTHWESTERN
SAN DIEGO STATE.

01:08.200 --> 01:16.100
AH, YES...
OLD NSWSDS...U.

01:16.100 --> 01:19.300
I SHOULD GET MY
OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE
ANY DAY,

01:19.300 --> 01:21.600
THEN IT'S GOODBYE,
PHILA-MA-DELPHIA.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.600
ANY SUMMER PLANS?

01:23.600 --> 01:27.600
TRAVEL. I'M SPENDING
TWO MONTHS IN MY CAR--
SEEING ALL 50 STATES.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.567
HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO DRIVE TO HAWAII?

01:30.567 --> 01:33.200
I'LL DRIVE TILL THEY
START SPEAKING CHINESE,

01:33.200 --> 01:34.600
THEN HANG A U-EE.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.300
TOPANGA.

01:38.300 --> 01:40.233
SO, HERE WE ARE,
ME AND YOU,

01:40.233 --> 01:42.834
LAST DAY OF SCHOOL,
BACK TOGETHER.

01:42.834 --> 01:44.033
BACK TOGETHER.

01:44.033 --> 01:46.000
DID I MENTION WE'RE
BACK TOGETHER?

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
REFRESH MY MEMORY.

01:48.000 --> 01:52.400
LISTEN, I'M COMPLETELY SECURE
WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP,

01:52.400 --> 01:54.500
AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR SUMMER AWAY AT CAMP,

01:54.500 --> 01:56.233
I AM TOTALLY O.K.
WITH IT...

01:56.233 --> 01:58.000
THAT IS SO MATURE.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.700
'CAUSE I'M GOING WITH YOU.

01:59.700 --> 02:02.800
CORY, IT'S
AN ALL-GIRLS CAMP.

02:02.800 --> 02:05.367
WHAT TIME'S SWIMMING?

02:05.367 --> 02:06.600
IT'S ONLY
ONE SUMMER.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.200
WE'LL HAVE PLENTY
MORE TOGETHER.

02:08.200 --> 02:11.500
BUT THIS IS THE
MOST IMPORTANT SUMMER
OF OUR LIVES.

02:11.500 --> 02:14.734
OUR 15TH YEAR. IF WE DON'T
SPEND IT TOGETHER,

02:14.734 --> 02:16.233
WE'LL NEVER GET IT BACK.

02:16.233 --> 02:19.233
THAT'S SWEET,
BUT IT'LL ONLY
MAKE NEXT SUMMER

02:19.233 --> 02:20.367
ALL THE MORE
SPECIAL.

02:20.367 --> 02:23.000
I'LL PAY YOU $1,000
TO HANG OUT WITH ME.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.667
CORY, IT'S ONLY
TWO MONTHS.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.367
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
WE WILL BE BACK
TOGETHER.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.000
BACK TOGETHER.

02:31.000 --> 02:34.200
WHICH IN SPANISH
IS "BACK TOGETHER,
<i>MUCHACHA." </i>

02:39.767 --> 02:41.934
WELL, THAT WAS
A BRAVE FRONT.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.767
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
MR. MATTHEWS?

02:50.767 --> 02:52.100
YOU SEEM A LITTLE DOWN.

02:52.100 --> 02:57.500
PERHAPS SOME MORE...
HISTORY HOMEWORK
WOULD CHEER YOU UP?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.500
KNOCK IT OFF, ERIC.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.867
I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF
YOUR FEENY PUPPET.

03:01.867 --> 03:02.934
COME ON, COR.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.800
I THOUGHT
EVERYTHING WAS GREAT

03:04.800 --> 03:06.400
NOW THAT YOU
AND TOPANGA

03:06.400 --> 03:08.300
ARE BACK TOGETHER,
BIG KISS.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.600
BACK TOGETHER,
BIG KISS.

03:09.600 --> 03:12.400
HEY, HEY, STAY OUT OF
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.900
TOPANGA'S LEAVING
FOR THE SUMMER,
AND I'M SORRY.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.567
I GOT ONE WEEK
LEFT HERE. LET'S
MAKE IT GREAT,

03:19.567 --> 03:20.700
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

03:23.033 --> 03:24.600
WHAT OLD TIMES?

03:28.300 --> 03:31.000
O.K., FINE, TOPANGA'S
GOING TO CAMP...

03:33.400 --> 03:35.200
AND IT'S
AN ALL-GIRL CAMP,

03:35.200 --> 03:37.400
BUT NO THREAT THERE.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.600
MORE TIME FOR US--
THE <i>BOYS </i>OF SUMMER.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.600
I'M SPENDING THE NEXT
TWO MONTHS TRAVELING
WITH MY DAD.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.100
THE BOY OF SUMMER.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.800
ALL RIGHT.
JUST ME. FINE.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.300
YOU SAID YOU
WERE STAYING HOME
THIS SUMMER.

03:50.300 --> 03:52.934
I AM. THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF A MOBILE HOME--

03:52.934 --> 03:54.667
WHEREVER YOU GO,
YOU'RE HOME.

03:55.867 --> 03:57.600
SO YOU'RE
LEAVING, TOO.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.200
NOT FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.600
ARE YOU O.K., COR?

04:01.600 --> 04:02.867
YEAH, YEAH, FINE.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.600
I CAN DO WITHOUT
MY BEST FRIEND
AND MY GIRLFRIEND

04:06.600 --> 04:08.133
FOR A COUPLE
MONTHS, RIGHT?

04:08.133 --> 04:10.400
IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN'T MAKE
NEW FRIENDS.

04:17.033 --> 04:18.100
SEE?

04:21.467 --> 04:25.600
MOM, DAD, I'VE DECIDED
I'M SPENDING MY SUMMER
IN ATLANTA

04:25.600 --> 04:28.133
SELLING
INTERNATIONAL FLAGS AT
THE OLYMPIC VILLAGE.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.500
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

04:30.500 --> 04:33.200
WELL, THEN
THIS SUMMER BLOWS.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.200
CORY, THE SUMMER'S
BARELY STARTED.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.100
AND ALREADY I
GOT NO TOPANGA,

04:37.100 --> 04:39.367
I GOT NO SHAWN,
I GOT NOTHING.

04:39.367 --> 04:41.400
YOUR BROTHER'S HERE
FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

04:41.400 --> 04:43.100
YEAH. COME SIT
WITH US.

04:43.100 --> 04:45.000
ERIC'S TELLING US
ABOUT HIS TRIP.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.100
I'M NOT REALLY
INTERESTED IN
ERIC'S TRIP.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.300
LET'S PUT MY ENTIRE
CROSS-COUNTRY TRIP
ON HOLD

04:51.300 --> 04:53.734
SO YOU CAN TELL US
HOW GREAT THE PARK IS.

04:53.734 --> 04:56.500
HOW IS THAT MONKEY BAR
RESTORATION COMING?

04:56.500 --> 04:59.133
IT'S A JUNGLE GYM, ERIC.

04:59.133 --> 05:03.500
WHY NOT TELL US HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO SEE THE GRAND CANYON

05:03.500 --> 05:06.200
IN 4 1/2 MINUTES...
BY DONKEY?

05:06.200 --> 05:09.500
GUYS, STOP
THE SNIPING.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.500
IT'LL STOP
FOR GOOD
WHEN I LEAVE.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.667
THERE'S ERIC.
ALWAYS LEAVING.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.367
WHY SHOULD I BE
SURPRISED?

05:14.367 --> 05:16.400
"COR, WANT TO SHOOT
SOME HOOPS?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.000
WAIT, HERE COMES JANICE."

05:18.000 --> 05:19.100
"COR, WANT A RIDE?

05:19.100 --> 05:21.000
WAIT. MY FRIENDS
WANT RIDES. SORRY."

05:21.000 --> 05:23.300
I'D LOVE TO STAY
AND TAKE MORE ABUSE,

05:23.300 --> 05:25.000
BUT, OOPS, I GOT
MORE PACKING TO DO.

05:27.734 --> 05:30.600
CORY, I'LL BE
YOUR FRIEND
THIS SUMMER.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.300
THANKS, MORGAN.

05:34.767 --> 05:38.700
OOPS, I FORGOT.
I HAVE DAY CAMP.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.900
YOU SEE?

05:42.900 --> 05:44.467
COR, WHAT ARE YOU
REALLY UPSET ABOUT?

05:44.467 --> 05:48.400
I'M UPSET
THAT TOPANGA'S
GOING TO CAMP.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.300
YOU THINK
THAT'S IT, HUH?

05:50.300 --> 05:53.367
YEAH. HOW COULD
SHE DO THAT?

05:53.367 --> 05:56.200
SHE HAS A RIGHT
TO GO TO CAMP.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.500
YOU GUYS NEVER
SENT ME TO CAMP.

05:58.500 --> 05:59.400
ARE YOU INSANE?

05:59.400 --> 06:01.934
WE TRIED TO
WHEN YOU WERE 8,

06:01.934 --> 06:04.200
BUT WE HAD TO
BRING YOU HOME.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.600
YOU SENT US
DAILY LETTERS

06:05.600 --> 06:09.100
SAYING THEY WERE
CONDUCTING MEDICAL
EXPERIMENTS ON YOU.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.967
AND THEY WERE.

06:11.967 --> 06:14.734
OH, COR, THIS WILL
BE A GREAT SUMMER.

06:14.734 --> 06:17.300
THINGS WILL WORK OUT
FOR THE BEST.

06:17.300 --> 06:18.967
YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT?

06:18.967 --> 06:21.033
YEAH, I DO.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.367
ERIC, I--I--
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU

06:27.367 --> 06:32.200
I KNOW THIS WEEK
HASN'T BEEN EASY
FOR ANY OF US,

06:32.200 --> 06:33.300
BUT, UH...

06:34.800 --> 06:36.734
OH, MAN, LOOK
AT THIS MESS.

06:36.734 --> 06:39.233
YEP. A LOT OF YEARS
TO PACK AWAY.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.867
YEAH, BUT LOOK AT MY BED.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.567
THAT'S HOW YOU LEFT IT
THIS MORNING.

06:43.567 --> 06:47.200
I DON'T THINK
IT WAS ANYWHERE
NEAR THIS BAD

06:47.200 --> 06:48.967
TILL YOU LEFT
YOUR MESS ON IT.

06:48.967 --> 06:51.767
FINE. I WILL
MOVE MY SOCK.

06:51.767 --> 06:54.100
THANK YOU.

06:54.100 --> 06:57.133
LOOK, I KNOW
YOUR SUMMER'S OFF
TO A ROUGH START,

06:57.133 --> 06:58.300
BUT LOOK
AT THE GOOD--

06:58.300 --> 07:01.467
I'LL BE OUT OF HERE
IN A WEEK.

07:01.467 --> 07:03.500
YOU'LL HAVE THE ROOM
TO YOURSELF.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.867
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
THIS ROOM TO MYSELF.

07:05.867 --> 07:07.400
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

07:07.400 --> 07:09.667
COME ON.
THE WAY YOU TREAT ME,

07:09.667 --> 07:12.300
AND YOU GOT TO ASK?
YOU IGNORE ME.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.467
WE DO STUFF TOGETHER.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.967
ONLY WHEN YOU'RE STUCK.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.367
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY
DID ANYTHING WITH ME
'CAUSE YOU WANTED TO.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.000
WHAT CAN I SAY
TO THAT?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.734
YOU'RE THREE YEARS
YOUNGER THAN ME.

07:21.734 --> 07:23.200
I HAVE
MY OWN FRIENDS.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.934
YEAH? WHERE WILL
YOUR FRIENDS BE
NEXT YEAR?

07:25.934 --> 07:28.233
YOU'LL ALL BE OFF AT
DIFFERENT COLLEGES,

07:28.233 --> 07:30.100
BUT I'LL STILL BE
YOUR BROTHER.

07:30.100 --> 07:34.000
YOU'RE RIGHT, CORY.
I AM A TERRIBLE BROTHER,

07:34.000 --> 07:36.100
BUT IN A WEEK I'LL BE GONE,

07:36.100 --> 07:38.033
AND I'LL BE
THE BEST BROTHER
YOU'VE EVER HAD.

07:42.300 --> 07:44.667
WHOA! WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THIS?

07:44.667 --> 07:45.800
TAKING IT
TO COLLEGE.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.300
THIS IS MY MIKE SCHMIDT
AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALL.

07:48.300 --> 07:50.000
HE SIGNED IT
TO BOTH OF US.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.400
JUST GIVE IT TO ME.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.500
CUT IT OUT.

07:52.500 --> 07:53.800
ERIC, STOP
BEING A JERK.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.500
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
THIS IS YOUR BALL.

07:56.500 --> 07:57.734
YOU WANT IT?
YES.

07:57.734 --> 08:00.100
YEAH. HERE, CATCH!

08:00.100 --> 08:01.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU JUST DID THAT.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.767
DON'T DO THAT.
YOU'LL GET HURT.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.600
I DON'T THINK
SO, O.K.?

08:08.400 --> 08:10.834
HEY! HEY, ERIC,
CUT IT OUT!

08:10.834 --> 08:12.300
GET OFF OF HIM!
STOP IT!

08:12.300 --> 08:14.400
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

08:14.400 --> 08:16.967
I TRIED TO BE
THE NICE GUY.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.567
OH, COME ON,
GUYS!

08:18.567 --> 08:21.133
THIS IS OUR LAST WEEK
ALL TOGETHER,

08:21.133 --> 08:24.767
AND IT'S YOUR LAST WEEK
SHARING THIS ROOM.

08:24.767 --> 08:26.967
I DON'T HAVE
TO SHARE IT FOR
ANOTHER WEEK.

08:26.967 --> 08:29.500
I DON'T NEED
THIS ANYMORE.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.600
I'M OUT OF HERE
TOMORROW.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.000
ERIC, YOU ARE NOT
LEAVING TOMORROW.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.200
YEAH, I AM.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.734
MAYBE YOU
DIDN'T HEAR ME.

08:47.734 --> 08:49.900
YOU ARE NOT
LEAVING TOMORROW.

08:49.900 --> 08:53.700
YOU HAVEN'T GOT YOUR
LETTER OF ACCEPTANCE
TO COLLEGE YET.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.100
OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE
COMES A DAY BEFORE CLASSES.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.367
I'M NOT GIVING
THIS TRIP UP.

08:57.367 --> 08:59.233
YOU'RE UPSET
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER,

08:59.233 --> 09:01.667
AND YOU'RE NOT
THINKING THIS THROUGH.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.300
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE,
A WEEK HERE OR THERE?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.200
ERIC, MAYBE WHEN
YOU'RE A PARENT,

09:06.200 --> 09:09.000
AND YOUR FIRST CHILD
IS ABOUT TO LEAVE HOME,

09:09.000 --> 09:12.000
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND
THAT EVERY MINUTE
MAKES A DIFFERENCE.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.900
YOU DON'T THINK
I'M NOT FREAKED OUT
ABOUT LEAVING?

09:14.900 --> 09:18.600
GOING TO COLLEGE?
BEING ON MY OWN?
DOING LAUNDRY?

09:18.600 --> 09:19.834
I'M HAVING
NIGHTMARES!

09:19.834 --> 09:21.467
WHITES, EASY.
DARKS, EASY.

09:21.467 --> 09:24.834
WHAT ABOUT MY
WHITE SHIRT WITH
BLACK STRIPES?

09:24.834 --> 09:26.500
WHAT THEN?

09:26.500 --> 09:29.567
SO? THIS IS TOUGH
ON ALL OF US.

09:29.567 --> 09:34.500
THAT'S WHY I THINK
IT'LL JUST BE EASIER
IF I TAKE OFF NOW.

09:34.500 --> 09:38.133
WE HAVE THIS
GOODBYE DINNER
PLANNED FOR YOU.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.600
IF YOU CAN MOVE THE DINNER
TO TOMORROW NIGHT,

09:40.600 --> 09:42.500
I'LL STAY
AN EXTRA DAY.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.200
PLEASE.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.200
WE'LL THINK
ABOUT IT.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
THANK YOU.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.500
ANOTHER LITTLE BIT
OF ADVICE.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.967
YOU TAKE
THAT EXTRA DAY,

09:53.967 --> 09:57.100
AND TRY AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS BOTHERING
YOUR BROTHER.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.400
WE'VE SHARED THAT ROOM
FOR 15 YEARS.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.600
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S BOTHERING HIM.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.734
WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER.

10:10.567 --> 10:11.967
WE'RE GLAD
YOU STAYED.

10:11.967 --> 10:13.900
SO AM I.
THIS PARTY'S COOL.

10:13.900 --> 10:16.400
IT WAS A GOOD IDEA
HAVING CORY'S FRIENDS.

10:16.400 --> 10:18.233
WELL, CONSIDERING
HOW HE FEELS

10:18.233 --> 10:20.400
ABOUT SHAWN
AND TOPANGA LEAVING,

10:20.400 --> 10:22.200
WE THOUGHT IT'D BE
A GOOD IDEA.

10:22.200 --> 10:24.567
TAKE YOUR ARM
OFF ME, MAN.

10:24.567 --> 10:26.367
YOU'RE MAKING
ME NERVOUS.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.867
TOPANGA, AM I
MAKING YOU NERVOUS?

10:28.867 --> 10:30.300
UH-HUH.

10:30.300 --> 10:34.300
IF I MAY, I HAVE
SOMETHING MORE TO SAY.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.300
OH, NO.

10:37.300 --> 10:40.300
SHH. HE'LL BE YOUR
PRINCIPAL ONE DAY.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.467
OH, NO.

10:42.467 --> 10:46.734
EARLIER THIS YEAR,
IT WAS DOUBTFUL THAT
YOU WOULD GRADUATE,

10:46.734 --> 10:50.867
BUT YOU RESPONDED
TO THE PRESSURE,
APPLIED YOURSELF,

10:50.867 --> 10:53.600
AND NOT ONLY GREW
AS A STUDENT,

10:53.600 --> 10:54.767
BUT AS A PERSON.

10:54.767 --> 10:58.000
AND I, FOR ONE,
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.934
THANK YOU, MR. FEENY.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.934
ALSO, I BROUGHT
A LITTLE GIFT.

11:03.734 --> 11:06.700
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
TO PULL THIS AND
HAVE IT FRAMED.

11:06.700 --> 11:08.767
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL
DIPLOMA.

11:12.734 --> 11:13.967
OH, MR. FEENY,
THANK YOU.

11:13.967 --> 11:17.300
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU
HATE TO BE TOUCHED,

11:17.300 --> 11:18.867
BUT, UH,
GIVE ME THIS ONE.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.033
ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ERIC.

11:23.033 --> 11:26.500
HEY, BUDDY, DON'T YOU
WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?

11:26.500 --> 11:27.567
NO, THAT'S O.K.

11:27.567 --> 11:29.400
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.
SAY SOMETHING.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.100
I DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING PLANNED.

11:31.100 --> 11:34.567
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK
I COULD'VE DONE THIS

11:34.567 --> 11:38.100
WITHOUT EVERYONE
IN THIS ROOM
BELIEVING IN ME.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.834
THAT'S WHY THIS DIPLOMA,

11:39.834 --> 11:42.400
WHICH SIGNIFIES
MY INTELLIGENCE,

11:42.400 --> 11:44.600
BELONGS AS MUCH TO YOU

11:44.600 --> 11:47.200
AS IT DOES TO...I.

11:49.200 --> 11:50.400
"ME."

11:50.400 --> 11:52.300
I INCLUDED YOU.

11:52.300 --> 11:53.600
OH, DEAR.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.367
I DO HAVE
A TOAST TO MAKE.

11:57.367 --> 11:58.567
ATTENTION,
EVERYBODY.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.600
TO MY BROTHER ERIC...
WHO'S MOVING OUT.

12:08.600 --> 12:12.834
AND NOT JUST
FOR FOUR YEARS.
PROBABLY FOREVER...

12:12.834 --> 12:15.033
AND I DON'T
EVEN KNOW HIM...

12:15.033 --> 12:17.200
AND NOW I PROBABLY
NEVER WILL.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.500
15 YEARS IN
THE SAME ROOM, ERIC.

12:25.567 --> 12:26.967
15 YEARS.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.600
GOODBYE.

12:33.100 --> 12:38.100
I--I HOPE YOU
HAVE A NICE LIFE.
I REALLY DO.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.767
I'M SORRY, EVERYONE.

12:49.467 --> 12:51.834
THAT'S THE LAST BAG.
CAR'S ALL LOADED.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.834
YEAH, I GUESS
THIS IS IT.

12:53.834 --> 12:57.133
OH, ERIC, YOU'RE
SURE YOU CAN'T STAY
FOR BREAKFAST?

12:57.133 --> 12:59.033
I COULD FIX YOU
AN OMELET.

12:59.033 --> 13:03.100
TOAST, PANCAKES,
MUFFINS...PIZZA.

13:03.100 --> 13:06.033
YOU JUST WANT ME TO
STAY TILL THE FREEZER'S
EMPTY, DON'T YOU?

13:06.033 --> 13:07.834
DOES IT SHOW?

13:07.834 --> 13:09.700
JUST 'CAUSE I KNOW YOU.

13:09.700 --> 13:11.700
SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR BROTHER.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.767
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

13:12.767 --> 13:15.033
HE SLEPT ON
THE COUCH.

13:15.033 --> 13:18.200
HE'S PRETTY
EMBARRASSED
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.500
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE
EMBARRASSED ABOUT.

13:22.967 --> 13:25.100
HEY, CORY, GET UP.
YOUR BROTHER'S LEAVING.

13:27.467 --> 13:30.000
HE SAID HE WAS GOING
TO THE PARK TO SAY
GOODBYE TO TOPANGA.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.467
MAYBE HE
ALREADY LEFT.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.367
UH, YEAH,
YOU KNOW, UM...

13:35.367 --> 13:38.900
JUST TELL HIM
GOODBYE AND GIVE HIM
A HUG FOR ME.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.500
ERIC, WE'LL HUG HIM,

13:40.500 --> 13:42.967
BUT THAT WON'T MAKE
CORY FEEL ANY BETTER.

13:42.967 --> 13:45.400
I'M JUST GOING
OFF TO COLLEGE.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.734
NOW IT'S "JUST
GOING OFF TO COLLEGE."

13:47.734 --> 13:51.133
THEN IT'LL BE
"JUST GETTING MARRIED.
JUST HAVING KIDS,"

13:51.133 --> 13:54.600
BUT YOU KNOW YOU WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME BROTHERS

13:54.600 --> 13:56.300
YOU WERE UPSTAIRS,
SHARING THAT ROOM.

13:56.300 --> 14:00.233
I'M THE OLDER BROTHER.
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

14:00.233 --> 14:02.967
BUT IT'S NOT
CORY'S FAULT HE'S
THE YOUNGER BROTHER

14:02.967 --> 14:05.834
WHO NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY YOUR BUDDIES
AND GIRLFRIENDS

14:05.834 --> 14:09.000
ALWAYS SEEMED TO
BE MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU THAN HIM.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.767
HE'S THREE YEARS
YOUNGER THAN ME.

14:10.767 --> 14:13.600
HE'S GOT
HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND,
HIS OWN BUDDIES.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.734
I BET HE'D UNDERSTAND
ME BETTER NOW.

14:16.734 --> 14:20.667
WELL, SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'VE GOT A LOT MORE
IN COMMON NOW.

14:20.667 --> 14:22.467
YEAH, I GUESS WE DO.

14:22.467 --> 14:26.600
AND THREE YEARS ISN'T
THAT BIG A DIFFERENCE
ANYMORE.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.600
NO. I GUESS I NEVER
REALLY LOOKED AT IT
LIKE THAT.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.734
I GUESS WE COULD
BE FRIENDS NOW.

14:32.734 --> 14:35.033
HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
LEAVING HIM FOR
THE SUMMER,

14:35.033 --> 14:37.834
HIS BEST FRIEND'S
LEAVING FOR THE SUMMER,

14:37.834 --> 14:39.400
AND NOW HIS BROTHER,

14:39.400 --> 14:43.200
WHO'S HE'S NEVER HAD
A CHANCE TO GET TO
KNOW AS A FRIEND,

14:43.200 --> 14:45.100
IS LEAVING...
FOREVER.

14:45.100 --> 14:48.367
BUT, NOW, WHY AREN'T
YOU GUYS UPSET?

14:48.367 --> 14:52.000
UH, WELL,
WE GOT TO KNOW YOU.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.367
IT'S O.K.
YOU CAN LEAVE.

14:54.367 --> 14:57.100
YOUR FATHER AND I
KNOW YOU'RE
A GOOD GUY,

14:57.100 --> 14:59.133
AND YOU HAVE
A GOOD HEART.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.100
YOU'VE ALWAYS
MADE US PROUD.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.400
SO, I GUESS
THIS IS GOODBYE.

15:07.400 --> 15:10.000
UH...UH, YEAH.
UM, YOU KNOW...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.500
I WASN'T VERY GOOD
AT THIS, SO...

15:12.500 --> 15:15.734
A FEW BUCKS. YOU KNOW,
EMERGENCIES, WHATEVER.

15:15.734 --> 15:18.100
UH, WHAT ABOUT
THE GOLD CARD?

15:18.100 --> 15:20.300
NO.
OH, ALL RIGHT.

15:20.300 --> 15:22.367
OH, GOOD. YOU
DIDN'T LEAVE YET.

15:22.367 --> 15:24.967
I WANTED TO GIVE
YOU SOMETHING.

15:24.967 --> 15:28.000
OH, FLUFFERS!
YOUR FAVORITE BEAR.

15:28.000 --> 15:31.300
YOU GIVING HIM
TO ME FOR LUCK,
MORGAN?

15:31.300 --> 15:32.900
NO. I'M 8 YEARS OLD.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.000
WHAT DO I NEED
A STINKING BEAR FOR?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.300
YOU GOING TO
MISS ME, MORGAN?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.000
I ALREADY DO.

15:42.300 --> 15:48.467
UM...SO, I GUESS
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT TO SAY,

15:48.467 --> 15:50.600
BUT, UH...GOODBYE.

15:50.600 --> 15:54.300
I LOVE YOU ALL
VERY MUCH.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.100
WE LOVE YOU,
TOO.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.033
WE LOVE YOU, TOO.
ALL RIGHT?

15:59.734 --> 16:00.800
GO ON,
GET OUT OF HERE.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.233
YOU WANT TO BEAT
THE RUSH HOUR.

16:03.233 --> 16:04.233
YEAH.
GO ON.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.400
I DON'T KNOW IF
I WANT TO GO.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.367
BUT YESTERDAY,
YOU COULD HARDLY
WAIT TO GO.

16:26.367 --> 16:28.834
I KNOW. USUALLY,
I LOOK FORWARD
TO CAMP.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.800
THIS TIME,
I FEEL I'M TOO OLD
FOR THAT.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.934
I'D RATHER SPEND
SUMMER WITH YOU,

16:33.934 --> 16:35.233
AND THAT SCARES ME.

16:35.233 --> 16:37.100
LOOK, IF THAT'S
HOW YOU FEEL,

16:37.100 --> 16:41.300
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME AT CAMP, O.K.?

16:41.300 --> 16:43.300
I AM COMPLETELY SECURE.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.900
YOU SWEAR ON YOUR LIFE
IT'S AN ALL-GIRLS CAMP?

16:47.300 --> 16:50.133
CORY, I WANT YOU TO
HAVE A GREAT SUMMER.

16:50.133 --> 16:52.734
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT ME.

16:52.734 --> 16:54.033
I'LL BE PLENTY BUSY

16:54.033 --> 16:56.133
DOING THE THINGS
I TRULY LOVE TO DO.

17:02.500 --> 17:06.500
OH, CORY,
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
LIKE THIS, MAN.

17:06.500 --> 17:10.033
SHAWN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:10.033 --> 17:13.867
ME AND MY DAD ARE
HITTING THE ROAD,
SO GOODBYE.

17:13.867 --> 17:16.300
[HORN HONKS]

17:16.300 --> 17:17.300
THAT'S MY BUS.

17:17.300 --> 17:21.767
[HORN HONKS
<i>LA CUCARACHA] </i>

17:21.767 --> 17:24.200
AND THAT'S MY HOUSE.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.934
I SHOULD GET GOING.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.500
I'LL MISS YOU.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.934
ME, TOO.

17:31.667 --> 17:35.033
SO, BUDDY, I'LL SEE
YOU IN A COUPLE OF
MONTHS, O.K.?

17:35.033 --> 17:38.300
YEAH. TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, SHAWN.

17:38.300 --> 17:39.400
YEAH. YOU, TOO.

17:41.767 --> 17:43.700
IT'S JUST
THE SUMMER, RIGHT?

17:43.700 --> 17:45.867
IT'LL GO BY QUICK.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.133
BYE.

17:56.667 --> 18:00.066
CORY MATTHEWS...
DRIBBLES AT THE
TOP OF THE KEY.

18:00.066 --> 18:02.100
HE LOOKS FOR THE OPEN MAN.
IT'S...

18:02.100 --> 18:03.967
CORY MATTHEWS.
HE PASSES TO MATTHEWS.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.867
MATTHEWS SEES MATTHEWS
SET UP FOR THE THREE.

18:06.867 --> 18:09.834
HE FEEDS MATTHEWS.
MATTHEWS SHOOTS!

18:14.300 --> 18:17.934
LOOKS LIKE
YOUR TEAM COULD
USE SOME HELP.

18:17.934 --> 18:19.100
ERIC.

18:19.100 --> 18:20.500
HEY, COR.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.934
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE HALFWAY
TO JERSEY BY NOW.

18:22.934 --> 18:25.967
YEAH, I WAS.
THEN I REALIZED

18:25.967 --> 18:29.300
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
A PROPER GOODBYE
FROM MY BROTHER.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.000
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME BACK?
TO SAY GOODBYE?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.767
YEAH.

18:33.767 --> 18:36.367
LISTEN, ERIC, I'M
GLAD YOU'RE HERE, TOO

18:36.367 --> 18:40.400
BECAUSE I NEVER GOT TO
TELL YOU I'M SORRY...

18:40.400 --> 18:41.900
FOR THE WAY
I'VE BEEN ACTING.

18:41.900 --> 18:43.600
IT'S NO BIGGIE.
WE'RE BROTHERS.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.200
BROTHERS FIGHT.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.734
YEAH, BUT I
DON'T LIKE IT WHEN
WE FIGHT, YOU KNOW?

18:48.734 --> 18:54.500
AND I ALSO DON'T LIKE IT
WHEN I DO THINGS LIKE THIS.

18:54.500 --> 18:56.200
IT'S MY LETTER FROM
NORTH SOUTHWESTERN.

18:56.200 --> 19:00.200
I KNOW. I TOOK IT FROM
THE MAILBOX YESTERDAY.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.867
I GUESS I JUST WASN'T
READY TO LET YOU GO.

19:05.400 --> 19:08.934
ERIC, I FEEL LIKE I'M
JUST GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

19:08.934 --> 19:13.200
I MEAN, I'VE ALWAYS
LIKED YOU AS A BROTHER,
YOU KNOW?

19:13.200 --> 19:16.233
BUT I'M JUST STARTING
TO LIKE YOU AS A FRIEND.

19:18.300 --> 19:20.100
I DIDN'T GET IN.

19:21.467 --> 19:22.734
WHAT?

19:24.667 --> 19:26.233
THEY REJECTED ME.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.600
MAYBE IT WAS A MISTAKE.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.300
IT WAS MY MISTAKE

19:33.300 --> 19:36.133
FOR THINKING I
COULD SLACK OFF
FOR 3 1/2 YEARS,

19:36.133 --> 19:39.200
WORK HARD
FOR TWO MONTHS,
AND GET IN.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.400
MAN, I REALLY WANTED
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.233
HEY, ERIC, YOU WILL.

19:43.233 --> 19:45.767
TAKE SOME COURSES
OVER THE SUMMER,
REAPPLY,

19:45.767 --> 19:46.967
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

19:46.967 --> 19:49.233
I BET YOU'LL
GET INTO AN EVEN
BETTER SCHOOL.

19:49.233 --> 19:51.200
YOU THINK SO?

19:51.200 --> 19:53.300
HEY, YOU'RE
MY BROTHER.

19:53.300 --> 19:56.000
COR, MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:56.000 --> 20:00.300
MAYBE I CAN FIND
A SCHOOL A LITTLE
CLOSER TO HOME.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.767
I KNOW WHERE
THERE'S AN OPEN BED.

20:03.100 --> 20:04.133
THANKS, COR.

20:04.133 --> 20:06.400
THINK ABOUT IT
WHILE YOU'RE GONE.

20:06.400 --> 20:07.734
WHERE AM I GOING?

20:07.734 --> 20:09.834
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.567
THAT TRIP
WAS TO CELEBRATE.

20:12.567 --> 20:14.200
ARE YOU KIDDING?

20:14.200 --> 20:17.100
A TRIP LIKE THAT
IS SOMETHING YOU
NEVER FORGET.

20:17.100 --> 20:19.700
YOU KNOW, CORY,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.834
MAYBE THERE IS
SOMETHING TO CELEBRATE.

20:22.834 --> 20:24.467
I WILL TAKE THAT TRIP...

20:24.467 --> 20:26.133
FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

20:26.133 --> 20:27.834
WHY WAIT?

20:27.834 --> 20:29.734
I GOT TO WAIT FOR YOU
TO GO HOME AND PACK.

20:33.133 --> 20:34.600
ME?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.300
YEAH. TWO MONTHS
ON THE ROAD.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.100
CAN'T THINK
OF ANYBODY ELSE

20:39.100 --> 20:40.200
I'D RATHER SHARE
THE CAR WITH.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.300
IT'LL BE A SUMMER
WE'LL NEVER FORGET.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.600
THINGS ALWAYS
SEEM TO WORK OUT
FOR THE BEST.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.000
I'VE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT.

20:58.567 --> 21:01.600
ON DAY TWO WE SEE
WASHINGTON, D.C.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.900
GIVE YOURSELVES
AT LEAST A DAY
IN BOSTON.

21:04.900 --> 21:09.200
THE <i>CHEERS </i>BAR.
MAYBE THEY'LL
"KNOW MY NAME."

21:09.200 --> 21:11.567
I WAS THINKING MORE
ALONG THE LINES

21:11.567 --> 21:14.033
OF BUNKER HILL,
OLD NORTH CHURCH.

21:14.033 --> 21:16.033
REMEMBER, WE'RE
ON A STRICT BUDGET.

21:16.033 --> 21:21.300
TRUE, BUT WE
COULD ALWAYS SLEEP
IN LINCOLN'S LAP.

21:21.300 --> 21:22.133
ALAN.

21:22.133 --> 21:25.867
UH...OH, WELL...

21:25.867 --> 21:27.233
SEE WASHINGTON.
