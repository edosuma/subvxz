00:33.440 --> 00:34.851
He's a madman!

00:37.819 --> 00:39.645
I must warn the President!

00:42.656 --> 00:44.483
Giant spider!

00:55.834 --> 00:59.665
And they say you scientists
are supposed to be smart.

03:18.161 --> 03:21.162
The legendary Captain James West.

03:21.956 --> 03:24.411
And I finally got him all to myself.

03:24.625 --> 03:27.993
And surely you should feel
free to treat him just...

03:28.753 --> 03:30.082
...bad.

03:42.140 --> 03:43.420
Darling...

03:44.517 --> 03:47.636
Hold on to that for me
for one second, would you?

03:52.857 --> 03:55.015
General McGrath's boys.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.813
Waiting for y'all for
a week, you show up now.

03:58.528 --> 04:01.445
You wouldn't be working up
here tonight, now, would you?

04:01.990 --> 04:06.117
Working? Now would you be working
if you were up here with you?

04:06.493 --> 04:08.071
I didn't think so.

04:10.163 --> 04:11.787
Wagon's coming!

04:18.462 --> 04:20.916
Come on, McGrath's
waiting on this stuff.

04:31.097 --> 04:32.805
Pack it up good, Virgil.

04:33.057 --> 04:34.635
Next stop, New Orleans.

04:50.071 --> 04:51.863
I'm not working!

04:52.740 --> 04:53.903
Problem solved.

04:54.116 --> 04:58.825
You can't just ram a man's personal
things into some hole like that.

04:59.079 --> 05:00.703
Is that so?

05:01.122 --> 05:02.865
I didn't mean it like that.

05:03.416 --> 05:05.124
Damn, this crate's heavy!

05:09.379 --> 05:11.122
Oh, Jim!

05:11.548 --> 05:15.461
Much as I'd like to take credit for
that, you might wanna hand me my gun.

05:39.696 --> 05:44.108
That was fun! Which one of you boys
wants to strip down and go next?

05:44.742 --> 05:46.153
Bet you do.

05:50.247 --> 05:51.741
Sure could use some clothes here!

05:57.169 --> 05:58.165
Well, well.

05:58.587 --> 06:00.081
We got us a shy nig...

06:08.178 --> 06:09.008
Pants!

06:44.167 --> 06:46.455
There was blood on the saddle

06:46.711 --> 06:48.370
And blood on the ground

06:48.587 --> 06:51.292
And a great big puddle of blood

06:51.506 --> 06:53.131
All around

07:02.808 --> 07:06.591
Oh, I'm so sorry. That
won't be possible. I have...

07:06.853 --> 07:08.133
...tonsillitis.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.976
I'm still waiting on
my guns and ammunition.

07:18.195 --> 07:20.401
I see my men have
brought your merchandise.

07:21.281 --> 07:22.195
General McGrath...

07:22.407 --> 07:24.980
...your weapons are being
delivered as we speak.

07:25.201 --> 07:28.367
Now, shall we go upstairs
and check the merchandise?

07:29.080 --> 07:31.368
Direct me to the poot, sir.

07:31.790 --> 07:34.162
I want something young and creamy.

07:34.417 --> 07:37.620
A gamer that takes to
the crop and the spur.

07:37.837 --> 07:40.327
You drive a hard bargain.
All right, 50 cents.

07:40.589 --> 07:43.839
I'm very flattered, but
I'm just not interested.

07:44.092 --> 07:46.380
You gotta be interested.
You're a whore!

07:47.970 --> 07:50.840
I may be a whore, but I work alone!

08:11.282 --> 08:12.562
Now I'm working.

08:24.042 --> 08:24.955
Ma'am.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.168
Nitro!

08:33.091 --> 08:37.171
This is not the way
you transport nitro!

09:23.175 --> 09:25.048
What's your name, missy?

09:25.343 --> 09:26.624
Dora.

09:27.345 --> 09:28.969
My mother's name was Dora.

09:29.222 --> 09:30.764
Oh, really?

09:31.640 --> 09:33.798
What kind of lady are you?

09:35.894 --> 09:37.602
She's mine!

09:40.022 --> 09:41.896
I feel like a ditty.

09:42.274 --> 09:44.017
Go on, girl! Sing!

09:45.652 --> 09:47.063
Okay, it's a ditty.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.648
"Sons of the South."

09:50.198 --> 09:51.608
Here you are.

09:58.997 --> 10:00.076
Tempo.

10:21.390 --> 10:22.553
Back on up, now.

10:36.028 --> 10:38.732
General "Bloodbath" McGrath.

10:39.072 --> 10:42.523
Sons of the South, come to glory

10:42.783 --> 10:44.361
Sons of the South

10:44.618 --> 10:46.160
Arise

11:08.680 --> 11:12.048
That's a lot of ham for these
skinny legs, let me tell you!

11:18.313 --> 11:20.352
That's a new one. Look!

11:22.900 --> 11:24.809
Let me out! Please!

11:25.027 --> 11:27.518
-This room's occupied.
-I'll say.

11:34.702 --> 11:36.741
Don't let the ear frighten you.

11:36.995 --> 11:38.537
I lost it at Chickamauga.

11:38.997 --> 11:40.491
Really? One can hardly notice.

11:40.707 --> 11:44.620
Would you help me undress? I always
have trouble undoing this clasp.

11:44.835 --> 11:46.294
Thank you.

11:50.256 --> 11:51.122
What's this?

11:51.341 --> 11:53.712
Why, it's a deep, deep pool.

11:54.051 --> 11:58.298
Maybe it's your old swimming hole,
general. Are you feeling sleepy?

11:58.638 --> 11:59.836
Yes, I'm sleepy.

12:00.432 --> 12:02.424
Now you'll be my little doggy.

12:02.642 --> 12:05.678
When I say "speak," you'll
tell me everything. Understood?

12:06.603 --> 12:07.552
Very good.

12:07.813 --> 12:11.762
Which scientist is in that sack in
the other room. Dr. Escobar? Speak.

12:14.485 --> 12:16.691
You can speak words, you stupid mutt.

12:17.154 --> 12:19.823
Who do you work for? Who
paid you to kidnap Escobar?

12:20.824 --> 12:23.112
No, watch the swirling
spiral. Watch the...

12:23.326 --> 12:24.405
Bad dog!

12:24.619 --> 12:25.863
Bad dog! Watch...

12:26.120 --> 12:27.068
Damn!

12:27.329 --> 12:28.740
Stay! Stay!

12:29.289 --> 12:30.202
Bad dog!

12:35.503 --> 12:38.289
Didn't mean to startle you.
Looked like you could use help.

12:38.505 --> 12:40.877
Looks can be deceiving,
dark stranger. I'm fine.

12:41.132 --> 12:42.461
I'm sure you are, ma'am.

12:42.842 --> 12:46.341
Big, sturdy gal like you
probably gets top dollar too.

12:47.388 --> 12:48.585
Here you go.

12:49.431 --> 12:52.965
Run along. I'm gonna sing my
old friend McGrath a lullaby.

12:53.184 --> 12:54.595
I need him!

12:55.269 --> 12:58.602
You got your money. Run
along! Have a little dignity.

12:58.814 --> 12:59.928
West!

13:14.285 --> 13:16.028
That'd be an awful career decision.

13:25.711 --> 13:28.167
West! West! Go! Go get him!

13:42.225 --> 13:43.505
Get Escobar out of here!

13:43.768 --> 13:45.013
Stop or I'll squeeze.

13:49.314 --> 13:50.974
U.S. Army! Stay out of my way, lady!

13:51.399 --> 13:52.977
I'm not a lady! I'm a U.S. marshal!

13:53.485 --> 13:55.062
Stay out of my way!

13:55.278 --> 13:58.812
"Get out of my way, get out of my way.

13:59.198 --> 14:00.905
U.S. Army.

14:01.158 --> 14:02.486
U.S. marshal."

14:02.701 --> 14:04.195
Oh, dear!

14:05.912 --> 14:07.821
Federal agents inside, sir.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.828
So Miss Lippenreider
informs me, Mr. Hudson.

14:16.003 --> 14:18.245
Still, I believe good
manners dictate...

14:18.506 --> 14:21.257
...that we should send
out the welcome wagon.

14:30.807 --> 14:31.721
Now what?

15:25.895 --> 15:27.555
Whoa, there, partner!

15:27.772 --> 15:30.097
The war may have got you
40 acres and a mule...

15:30.316 --> 15:34.182
...but you can't just traipse into the
President's office. Give me that gun.

15:34.736 --> 15:36.278
What, that one?

15:37.363 --> 15:38.442
What about that one?

15:43.869 --> 15:45.908
-That'll get you killed.
-Gentlemen!

15:46.162 --> 15:49.613
Don't make Captain West any
later than he already is.

15:54.586 --> 15:56.329
There've been a lot of death threats.

15:56.588 --> 15:59.422
The Cabinet made me hire
these damned detectives.

16:00.257 --> 16:01.288
Drink?

16:01.550 --> 16:02.499
Cigar?

16:02.759 --> 16:04.551
Don't mind if I do, sir.

16:04.845 --> 16:07.679
So I understand you let
General McGrath get away.

16:08.014 --> 16:10.136
That's not exactly
the way it happened.

16:10.391 --> 16:13.676
-Some half-a-sissy masquerading
as... -Artemus Gordon.

16:14.061 --> 16:14.890
You know him?

16:15.103 --> 16:18.721
Of course. He's the best marshal
I've got. A kind of genius.

16:18.981 --> 16:23.643
Gordon has proven himself as a cunning
operator, with a rapacious intellect.

16:23.860 --> 16:26.529
Nothing will stop him from
completing a mission...

16:26.780 --> 16:30.314
...except maybe the impulsive
actions of a headstrong cowboy.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.446
Who are you, mister?

16:32.701 --> 16:34.740
What do you mean, who am I?

16:35.078 --> 16:37.070
I am the President
of the United States.

16:37.622 --> 16:38.571
Wrong answer.

16:42.376 --> 16:43.621
Who are you?

16:45.128 --> 16:47.998
I am the President of
the... I'm Artemus Gordon.

16:48.923 --> 16:50.298
How did you know?

16:52.259 --> 16:54.964
The President went to West
Point. That says Harvard.

16:55.178 --> 16:56.803
Very observant.

16:59.974 --> 17:02.215
Somebody mind telling
me what's going on?

17:02.685 --> 17:04.060
President Grant...

17:05.729 --> 17:07.472
Sir, these are perilous times.

17:07.981 --> 17:11.431
I was merely demonstrating how
someone, using the art of disguise...

17:11.692 --> 17:15.771
...could penetrate into the very
bowels of the White House, sir.

17:16.029 --> 17:19.397
You're clever, Gordon. One day
it's going to get you killed.

17:20.282 --> 17:21.825
Like today.

17:23.368 --> 17:27.864
And, West, not every situation calls
for your approach of "shoot first...

17:28.123 --> 17:29.866
...shoot later, shoot some more...

17:30.083 --> 17:33.249
...then when everybody's dead,
try to ask a question or two."

17:33.877 --> 17:35.252
Working together will be good.

17:35.462 --> 17:37.620
-Working together?
-With all due respect...

17:37.881 --> 17:40.751
You'll work the way your
Commander in Chief tells you to.

17:41.175 --> 17:43.464
Well, I was coming to that, sir.

17:52.226 --> 17:55.310
Gentlemen, America's top scientists...

17:55.562 --> 17:58.313
...in the fields of physics,
hydraulics, explosives...

17:58.565 --> 18:03.142
...all kidnapped in the last year, and
all by General McGrath, it now appears.

18:03.527 --> 18:06.563
You two have been working on
the same case the whole time.

18:07.239 --> 18:09.361
Why did it take so
long to figure it out?

18:09.616 --> 18:13.482
One of us was trying to catch McGrath,
and the other was trying to marry him.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.119
We don't have time for this.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.371
Only one week, if we believe this.

18:19.541 --> 18:21.865
"General Grant, the
scientists you seek...

18:22.126 --> 18:24.664
...are in my employ
creating a weapons system...

18:24.878 --> 18:27.334
...beyond the pale of
contemporary imagination.

18:27.589 --> 18:29.996
I suggest you put
your affairs in order.

18:30.216 --> 18:33.881
You have one week before you will
surrender the U.S. government."

18:34.261 --> 18:37.178
The letter was delivered
today with that cake.

18:39.933 --> 18:42.221
-It's marzipan, isn't it?
-Careful.

18:44.979 --> 18:46.259
It's McGrath, sir.

18:46.480 --> 18:49.729
McGrath may be a vicious killer,
but a mastermind he is not.

18:50.358 --> 18:53.193
So whom do we seek? After
consulting with Intelligence...

18:53.444 --> 18:56.361
McGrath is on his way to New
Orleans. The longer we stay here...

18:56.613 --> 18:58.985
...the farther he gets.
I don't need Intelligence.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.865
You'd rather rely on stupidity.

19:01.117 --> 19:02.944
I am leaving today for Utah...

19:03.160 --> 19:07.074
...where the transcontinental railroads
will be joined at Promontory Point.

19:07.789 --> 19:09.580
You two are the best I've got.

19:09.791 --> 19:11.783
Put aside your differences...

19:12.001 --> 19:15.535
...and find this madman,
whoever he is, and stop him.

19:16.296 --> 19:17.874
You have one week.

19:18.465 --> 19:19.414
Dismissed.

19:27.514 --> 19:28.545
Gentlemen.

19:28.890 --> 19:30.847
The Wanderer is at your disposal.

19:31.142 --> 19:33.218
Engine number five, track six.

19:33.477 --> 19:36.431
Mr. Gordon, the item you requested.

19:37.189 --> 19:38.268
Thank you.

19:43.611 --> 19:44.441
Figures.

19:44.695 --> 19:45.691
My new invention.

19:45.905 --> 19:50.815
The Bi-Valve Interior Combustion
Twice-Exhausted Bi-Axle Nitro-Cycle.

19:51.076 --> 19:52.486
Save it. Got a train to catch.

19:56.955 --> 19:58.995
Not if I catch it first.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.602
Nice horse!

20:44.704 --> 20:45.783
Gordon!

20:51.668 --> 20:53.826
Stop the train!

21:00.342 --> 21:02.548
Hey! I'm warning you!

21:02.802 --> 21:04.261
Gordon! Stop the train!

21:04.887 --> 21:06.880
Come in. Have a seat.

21:07.139 --> 21:08.966
Stop the train!

21:09.224 --> 21:11.300
Stop smiling at me!

21:21.193 --> 21:23.434
How nice of you to drop in.

21:24.195 --> 21:25.393
All right...

21:27.031 --> 21:30.945
Let's drop the beards, the
bikes, the fake boobies.

21:31.201 --> 21:34.320
Let's set that needlepoint
aside and handle this like men.

21:34.579 --> 21:37.864
As a matter of clarification,
this is not needlepoint.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.160
This is needlepoint.

21:40.834 --> 21:43.503
I'm putting the final touches
on my latest invention.

21:43.753 --> 21:45.829
I call it The Impermeable.

21:46.088 --> 21:47.880
It's a vest. When
worn under clothing...

21:48.132 --> 21:51.216
...it can stop any bullet,
fired even at close range.

21:51.468 --> 21:53.923
-Is that so?
-But I haven't tested it fully yet.

21:54.179 --> 21:55.008
Guns.

21:55.471 --> 21:59.682
I find them primitive and unnecessary
if one's done one's proper planning.

21:59.933 --> 22:04.345
I have always felt that allowing any
situation to degenerate into violence...

22:04.604 --> 22:06.643
...constitutes a failure on my part.

22:06.898 --> 22:07.977
Well, Mr. Gordon...

22:08.524 --> 22:09.686
...you failed.

22:15.446 --> 22:17.937
All right, Mr. West,
we'll settle this...

22:18.574 --> 22:20.068
...like men.

22:41.843 --> 22:43.468
I love this train.

22:46.764 --> 22:47.879
Cheers!

22:48.974 --> 22:51.382
While you're down there,
feel free to make use...

22:51.643 --> 22:54.560
...of my Sub-Carriage
Inter-Rail Vehicular Egressor.

22:55.021 --> 22:56.764
I designed it myself!

23:00.317 --> 23:03.187
I've been thinking. Maybe
the President's right.

23:03.445 --> 23:07.193
We should put aside our
differences and work together.

23:09.366 --> 23:11.442
Fight each other all you
please. Harm my train...

23:11.702 --> 23:13.077
...I'll douse you like dogs.

23:13.328 --> 23:15.285
That's my truffle reduction sauce.

23:15.747 --> 23:19.162
Let's get on about our
President's business, shall we?

23:19.708 --> 23:21.119
-Where to?
-New Orleans.

23:21.418 --> 23:23.707
Why don't we let
Professor Morton decide?

23:23.962 --> 23:27.247
I don't need some nobody
professor telling me where to head.

23:28.299 --> 23:32.378
Meet Professor Thaddeus Morton,
kidnapped from M.I.T. six months ago.

23:32.636 --> 23:37.262
Expert in the field of metallurgy.
Discovered in a field of alfalfa.

23:37.515 --> 23:39.424
That's a man's head.

23:39.934 --> 23:44.145
This magnetic collar was found
about six feet away, near his body.

23:44.396 --> 23:46.187
Still trying to figure that out.

23:46.439 --> 23:47.554
That's a man's head.

23:48.191 --> 23:52.353
According to the Retinal Terminus
Theory, a dying person's last image...

23:52.611 --> 23:55.896
...burns into his eyeball like
a photo. Perhaps there's a clue.

23:56.156 --> 23:59.275
I give you Morton's last image.

23:59.533 --> 24:03.032
That's a man's head.

24:11.168 --> 24:15.746
Refraction of the lenses causes the
image to appear upside down, so we...

24:24.721 --> 24:25.752
That...

24:26.473 --> 24:28.714
...is a man's...

24:31.894 --> 24:32.925
...head.

24:34.187 --> 24:35.017
Voilà!

24:37.065 --> 24:37.930
McGrath.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.818
Something's in his pocket.
It's too fuzzy to see.

24:41.068 --> 24:43.310
Mortification of the aqueous
humor's led to a loss...

24:43.570 --> 24:44.649
Glasses.

24:50.951 --> 24:55.245
"Friends of the South, come to a
costume ball, April 14, half past 8.

24:55.497 --> 24:57.121
346 Pine Court, Garden District."

24:58.124 --> 24:59.666
New Orleans.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.634
Gypsy queen...pirate...

25:17.432 --> 25:19.804
How about this? Come as my manservant.

25:20.476 --> 25:22.385
Why, yes'um, Master Gordon!

25:22.645 --> 25:26.558
I swears I'd be delighted!
I sing, I dance for you, sir.

25:26.815 --> 25:30.942
I swears none of the white folks'll
know I'd rather shoot myself...

25:31.193 --> 25:33.269
...than play your damn manservant.

25:33.487 --> 25:35.526
You must wear something.
It's a costume party.

25:35.739 --> 25:37.482
This is all I need to wear.

25:37.741 --> 25:39.733
If you insist on a
firearm, I have something...

25:39.993 --> 25:42.661
...you'll find intriguing.
I designed it to go...

25:42.953 --> 25:44.495
...with this.

25:45.789 --> 25:47.781
Jim West does not wear costumes.

25:48.083 --> 25:49.660
Very well. What's your plan?

25:49.918 --> 25:52.953
I was thinking I'd go
as a government agent...

25:53.212 --> 25:55.335
...who'll kill General
Bloodbath McGrath.

25:55.589 --> 25:59.538
An armed, Negro cowboy costume in a
room full of white former slave owners.

25:59.801 --> 26:01.129
You'll win first prize.

26:01.344 --> 26:04.926
Listen, the art of disguise is what
we need to get into the party...

26:05.180 --> 26:07.137
...to find the kidnapped scientists...

26:07.390 --> 26:10.925
...before they're forced to create
something that'll destroy the U.S.

26:11.185 --> 26:13.937
You and I have been
handpicked by the President.

26:14.188 --> 26:17.888
Our freedom is at stake,
and this is our duty as men.

26:18.149 --> 26:20.901
You go as a riverboat captain,
and I'll be a saloon girl.

26:21.694 --> 26:24.363
Let me tell you something
about your art of disguise.

26:24.613 --> 26:27.982
That night at Fat-Can's, it wasn't
difficult to see you weren't a woman.

26:28.700 --> 26:30.075
I was propositioned by three men.

26:30.326 --> 26:31.737
You looked nasty.

26:31.994 --> 26:33.619
Just butt-ugly.

26:33.871 --> 26:36.492
I mean, your breasts
were hard and stiff...

26:36.748 --> 26:39.868
...and stuck out like a couple
of rusty cannons on a sunken ship.

26:40.126 --> 26:42.498
These breasts are a work of art.

26:42.753 --> 26:45.125
Aesthetically and
scientifically perfect.

26:45.547 --> 26:46.828
They look like shit.

26:49.092 --> 26:50.586
-Touch them.
-I'm not touching those!

26:50.843 --> 26:52.635
Afraid you're wrong? Touch my breasts!

26:52.887 --> 26:54.678
Just one. Touch one!

26:56.306 --> 26:57.587
Happy? I'm touching them.

26:57.849 --> 26:58.964
I knew it!

26:59.226 --> 27:00.636
Squeeze it gently.

27:00.977 --> 27:04.345
Not that hard! Now you've
shifted all the buckwheat around.

27:04.772 --> 27:06.230
Buckwheat? That's your problem.

27:07.774 --> 27:08.604
What are you doing?

27:19.909 --> 27:21.072
Now touch my breast.

27:26.165 --> 27:28.204
That's what a breast should feel like.

27:28.458 --> 27:29.573
Very nice.

27:29.960 --> 27:33.375
-Now touch yourself.
-Oh, my God, I'm hard!

27:37.841 --> 27:39.549
I was just gonna jot down a note.

27:42.887 --> 27:44.630
You could put a gun on that.

27:44.847 --> 27:46.804
Then where would I keep my pencil?

27:47.433 --> 27:51.050
I think you underestimate
the convenience of a pocket.

28:19.876 --> 28:22.332
What are you doing here, boy?

28:23.296 --> 28:24.624
I sorry, sir.

28:25.131 --> 28:26.293
I was hoping...

28:27.424 --> 28:28.835
I was hoping I wouldn't...

28:29.843 --> 28:32.049
...have to break your nose.

28:47.816 --> 28:49.191
White folks.

28:51.069 --> 28:52.777
Get your hands off me!

28:52.987 --> 28:56.771
Put me in the dungeon with those smelly,
bearded men, but I won't get on that!

28:56.991 --> 28:59.149
-You applied for the
position. -A standing-up one!

28:59.743 --> 29:01.320
I'm an entertainer.

29:04.372 --> 29:07.325
Stop complaining. You'll enjoy it.

29:19.051 --> 29:23.344
An authentic cowboy outfit,
complete with six-guns.

29:23.721 --> 29:27.054
What a terribly clever costume, Mr...?

29:27.266 --> 29:28.096
West.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.007
Jim West.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.313
West meets East.

29:34.522 --> 29:36.182
Mae Lee East.

29:36.399 --> 29:37.229
Ma'am.

29:38.359 --> 29:40.932
Are you here alone, Mr. West?

29:41.194 --> 29:46.069
I'm looking to surprise an old friend,
General McGrath. You haven't seen him?

29:46.324 --> 29:50.024
I don't think that name was on
our guest list. And I would know.

29:50.327 --> 29:53.197
I am Dr. Loveless' personal assistant.

29:53.413 --> 29:55.121
Dr. Arliss Loveless?

29:55.373 --> 29:57.164
Funny how some folks think he's dead.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.749
Tonight is his coming-out party.

30:04.547 --> 30:07.713
See anybody that looks familiar?

30:08.968 --> 30:10.759
Matter of fact, I do.

30:11.011 --> 30:12.256
I am jealous.

30:12.512 --> 30:13.675
Don't be.

30:18.517 --> 30:21.387
Meet me later in the foyer.

30:26.733 --> 30:31.192
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord

30:31.570 --> 30:36.065
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

30:36.324 --> 30:40.784
He has loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword

30:41.078 --> 30:45.704
His truth is marching on

31:03.096 --> 31:06.928
Don't you just hate that song?

31:15.065 --> 31:18.433
Why, y'all look like
you've seen a ghost.

31:19.110 --> 31:21.896
It's me, dear friends.

31:22.654 --> 31:24.647
Alive and kicking.

31:25.699 --> 31:27.987
Well, alive, anyway.

31:28.910 --> 31:30.320
We may have lost the war...

31:30.744 --> 31:34.195
...but heaven knows we haven't
lost our sense of humor.

31:36.291 --> 31:38.746
No, not even when we lost a lung...

31:39.043 --> 31:40.585
...a spleen...

31:40.836 --> 31:42.378
...a bladder...

31:42.629 --> 31:44.586
...two legs...

31:44.798 --> 31:47.798
...35 feet of small intestine...

31:48.051 --> 31:52.759
...and our ability to reproduce,
all in the name of the South!

31:53.013 --> 31:56.346
Do we ever lose our sense of humor?

31:59.018 --> 32:02.019
Now, I owe a deep debt of gratitude...

32:02.271 --> 32:05.307
...to our friends from across
the sea for their comfort...

32:05.524 --> 32:07.397
...and kindness.

32:08.818 --> 32:11.190
So mi casa es su casa!

32:14.114 --> 32:17.482
Let the party begin!

32:20.286 --> 32:21.863
Mr. West.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.284
How nice of you to join us...

32:28.543 --> 32:31.377
...and add color to these
monochromatic proceedings.

32:31.629 --> 32:33.123
When one comes back from the dead...

32:33.380 --> 32:36.001
...I find that an occasion
to stand up, be counted.

32:37.133 --> 32:41.593
Miss East informs me that you
expected to see General McGrath here.

32:41.846 --> 32:43.126
I knew him years ago...

32:43.347 --> 32:46.929
...but I haven't seen
him in a coon's age.

32:48.017 --> 32:50.389
It'd be difficult for
a man of your stature...

32:50.645 --> 32:52.886
...to keep in touch with
even half the people you know.

32:53.731 --> 32:58.308
Perhaps Miss East will keep you from
being a slave to your disappointment.

32:58.818 --> 33:01.487
Beautiful women encourage
you one minute...

33:01.737 --> 33:03.694
...then cut the legs
out from under you.

33:03.947 --> 33:05.987
Quite. Will you excuse me?

33:07.701 --> 33:08.780
Thank you.

33:46.775 --> 33:50.060
You're in for a big surprise when
you get this one in the saddle.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.487
Stupid cowboy!

33:53.989 --> 33:55.863
He mistake you for me.

34:03.539 --> 34:06.112
Dr. Loveless, our cause
is in a grave situation.

34:06.333 --> 34:10.710
Since the nitro and guns were destroyed,
lice and demoralization has set in...

34:10.962 --> 34:13.083
General McGrath, if I may interrupt.

34:13.380 --> 34:16.085
Your men will have
their weapons tonight...

34:16.341 --> 34:21.132
...and they will be part of the greatest
military victory of this century.

34:21.387 --> 34:23.214
So have your men...

34:23.639 --> 34:24.670
...here...

34:27.559 --> 34:28.934
...at 10:00 tonight.

34:31.020 --> 34:33.013
You, sir, are a pip.

34:33.481 --> 34:36.054
I'd follow you into the
jaws of Cerberus hisself.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.274
And so you shall.

35:15.599 --> 35:18.268
Please! Somebody help me out!

35:44.040 --> 35:47.159
I said to meet me in the foyer.

35:47.584 --> 35:48.782
Foyer?

35:49.169 --> 35:51.457
I've never been much good with French.

35:57.092 --> 35:58.467
Au contraire.

36:00.512 --> 36:02.718
So let's see, Mr. West.

36:03.681 --> 36:06.884
Are you a dangerous
spy of some sort...

36:07.142 --> 36:09.894
...or just a handsome cowboy...

36:10.312 --> 36:11.177
...who likes to...

36:12.021 --> 36:13.397
...poke around?

36:14.482 --> 36:16.439
I believe I'm that second one.

36:19.444 --> 36:21.353
East and West.

36:24.323 --> 36:27.158
Never the twain shall meet.

36:55.892 --> 36:59.426
First, I'd like to reiterate
that you make one ugly woman.

37:01.021 --> 37:04.057
Second, while you were out
here, I found out Dr. Loveless...

37:04.315 --> 37:06.722
...is meeting McGrath
and his troops in an hour.

37:06.984 --> 37:08.941
You go right ahead, enjoy the party.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.819
I'm gonna save the Republic.

37:11.071 --> 37:14.024
By the way, boobies look
great tonight. Nice and perky!

37:18.369 --> 37:19.827
Hang him!

37:29.336 --> 37:33.914
We need to teach y'all a lesson
about how to behave in polite society.

37:34.174 --> 37:38.005
Never drum on a white lady's boobies
at a big redneck dance. Got it.

37:38.219 --> 37:40.543
Sure am glad we got that cleared up.

37:55.775 --> 37:57.269
My God!

37:57.985 --> 38:00.108
Excuse me, am I intruding?

38:01.363 --> 38:03.023
I feel I know you from somewhere.

38:03.448 --> 38:04.693
Nice try, buster.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.694
I look like something out
of James Fenimore Cooper...

38:07.910 --> 38:09.784
...but I mean you no harm.

38:10.037 --> 38:11.780
My name is Artemus Gordon...

38:11.997 --> 38:15.200
...and if I'm not mistaken,
you're in trouble. Allow me.

38:17.376 --> 38:18.455
I'm Rita.

38:18.878 --> 38:20.621
I was hired as an entertainer.

38:20.879 --> 38:23.204
Not that I'm complaining,
but why are you here?

38:23.757 --> 38:27.968
I'm looking for some missing
scientists, not that I'm complaining.

38:33.265 --> 38:36.882
I'm a special U.S. marshal on
assignment from the President.

38:37.101 --> 38:39.639
If you're so special, how
come you're looking up here...

38:39.854 --> 38:41.893
...when Loveless has
them in the dungeon?

38:42.147 --> 38:43.974
The dungeon has been cleared out.

38:44.191 --> 38:48.603
I checked it after sampling the gumbo,
which was a bit heavy on the okra.

38:50.321 --> 38:51.731
There you are.

38:52.281 --> 38:53.775
Thank you. Artemus, was it?

38:54.032 --> 38:55.312
It was.

38:55.700 --> 38:57.942
I don't forget a face that easily.

39:01.038 --> 39:02.864
Like to have everybody's attention.

39:03.915 --> 39:07.284
We've had a series of major
misunderstandings this evening...

39:07.543 --> 39:10.579
...and I'd like to take a
minute to clear a few of them up.

39:11.422 --> 39:12.964
First of which...

39:13.215 --> 39:15.836
...the whole drumming
on the boobies thing.

39:16.468 --> 39:17.547
In my native land...

39:17.802 --> 39:19.925
-Georgia?
-Africa.

39:20.513 --> 39:24.095
...my ancestors used drums to
communicate between villages.

39:24.349 --> 39:26.223
I'm sure y'all can see how...

39:26.434 --> 39:29.803
...with this gal, we can communicate
all the way to Baton Rouge.

39:31.397 --> 39:34.066
On a clear night, we
might even get Galveston.

39:34.316 --> 39:37.352
All I was saying to the gal
was, "Nice dress, darling.

39:37.610 --> 39:40.527
Good to see you. My name's
Jim. How's your mama?"

39:40.863 --> 39:43.104
Then there was the redneck comment.

39:43.323 --> 39:46.240
And I'm getting the sense that
y'all took that negatively.

39:46.743 --> 39:48.201
But let's break down that word.

39:48.870 --> 39:50.150
"Redneck."

39:50.454 --> 39:54.403
First word: Red. Color
of passion, fire, power.

39:54.666 --> 39:56.742
Second word: Neck.

39:59.253 --> 40:00.831
Neck...

40:04.633 --> 40:08.381
I can't think of anything for
"neck," but y'all still got "red."

40:08.594 --> 40:10.634
That's something to be proud of.

40:11.222 --> 40:13.593
And between us, the
whole slavery thing...

40:13.849 --> 40:16.553
...I don't understand what
the big deal was anyway.

40:16.768 --> 40:19.887
Who wouldn't want folks
running around doing chores?

40:20.146 --> 40:22.767
Are you gonna get your
big, fat ass out of bed...

40:23.023 --> 40:25.395
...and pick your own damn cotton?

40:25.609 --> 40:26.604
I don't think so.

40:26.860 --> 40:30.109
So let's head on inside,
knock us back some shine.

40:30.363 --> 40:32.320
IKick this shindig off the right way!

40:32.573 --> 40:35.242
Come on! Put this thing away.

40:35.826 --> 40:37.734
Come on! Let's go inside!

40:37.952 --> 40:38.983
Let's hang him!

40:39.203 --> 40:41.409
All right, hold on. Hold on!

40:42.456 --> 40:46.405
I stand before you as a man realizing
that I've done something wrong.

40:47.210 --> 40:49.617
I'd like the opportunity
to make it right.

40:51.339 --> 40:52.881
Will you marry me?

40:53.090 --> 40:55.129
That means "no." Darling, listen.

40:55.342 --> 40:57.500
Would it help if I said
I thought you were a man?

41:09.896 --> 41:11.639
Something's funny about that rope!

41:15.359 --> 41:17.102
Thank you! We had a lovely time!

41:22.239 --> 41:25.323
"Hang him! Hang him!" I
ought to shoot you right now.

41:25.534 --> 41:29.697
Allow me to introduce you to my
trigger-happy partner, James West...

41:29.954 --> 41:32.789
...who doesn't realize that
my Expanding Rope invention...

41:33.040 --> 41:37.333
...was a diversion allowing me to
search for the missing scientists.

41:37.586 --> 41:39.080
Scientists?

41:39.838 --> 41:43.965
This is Rita. I found her in
a cage in Loveless' bedroom.

41:44.216 --> 41:45.379
She's an entertainer.

41:45.634 --> 41:48.588
I'm afraid I haven't been
quite honest with you.

41:48.845 --> 41:50.125
My name is Rita Escobar.

41:50.346 --> 41:54.260
I came to find Guillermo
Escobar, the scientist. My father.

41:54.516 --> 41:57.387
Sorry to interrupt, but I
gotta get to Malheureux Point.

41:57.811 --> 41:59.009
Malheureux Point?

42:02.732 --> 42:04.938
He's so impetuous.

42:06.276 --> 42:07.984
Yes, he's an idiot.

42:13.574 --> 42:17.239
Well, general, it's been a
long journey from New Liberty.

42:17.494 --> 42:20.163
Not a day goes by that
I don't contemplate it.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.201
So do I.

42:21.456 --> 42:26.033
If I'd had the scientific understanding
of gunpowder and primers I have today...

42:26.251 --> 42:27.710
...I might've been standing here.

42:27.961 --> 42:28.992
That's not what I meant.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.786
You meant the
stomach-churning carnage...

42:32.090 --> 42:35.540
...that earned you your
unfortunate nom de guerre.

42:35.759 --> 42:38.676
What was that nickname again?

42:42.348 --> 42:44.471
Bloodbath McGrath.

42:46.268 --> 42:48.675
The Butcher of New Liberty.

42:52.982 --> 42:54.773
They ought to be here by now.

42:54.984 --> 42:57.272
Maybe we're in the wrong place.

42:57.736 --> 43:01.603
We're supposed to wait
exactly on this here spot.

43:52.323 --> 43:55.194
You sawed-off sadistic
bastard! You betrayed us!

43:55.409 --> 43:59.620
Having donated half my being to create
a weapon capable of doing this...

43:59.830 --> 44:02.320
...how did you and General
Lee repay my Ioyalty?

44:02.582 --> 44:05.915
You surrendered at Appomattox!
So who betrayed whom?

44:06.252 --> 44:09.418
Munitia, make note the turret
speed must be accelerated.

44:09.713 --> 44:12.417
Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8.

44:13.216 --> 44:14.793
Scream...scream...

44:15.009 --> 44:16.171
"Help me."

44:16.427 --> 44:17.707
"Do not pull my arm!"

44:17.928 --> 44:20.715
I demand you give the order
to stop this slaughter now!

44:20.931 --> 44:24.429
We'll need more loading drills. I
hear too much time between screams.

44:25.434 --> 44:27.178
Give them the order to desist!

44:27.394 --> 44:32.186
I understand your distress, but
these men are not dying senselessly.

44:32.440 --> 44:35.773
It is for a far greater cause
than you can possibly imagine.

44:36.068 --> 44:38.440
You go straight to hell, sir!

44:38.654 --> 44:40.029
After you, sir.

44:46.160 --> 44:47.535
Bloodbath McGrath...

44:47.745 --> 44:49.571
...indeed.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.665
That concludes the festivities.

44:52.999 --> 44:55.537
Ladies, feed him to the crabs.

44:55.793 --> 45:00.122
Since the beginning of written history,
a nation's power has been determined...

45:00.380 --> 45:03.665
...by the size of its army.
Tonight, that chapter will be closed.

45:04.008 --> 45:08.883
The traditional army, to say nothing of
the United States, will become extinct.

45:09.096 --> 45:11.254
Laid low by a cripple...

45:11.473 --> 45:13.928
...as the general so
amusingly implied...

45:14.142 --> 45:16.514
...and "mechanology."

45:17.228 --> 45:19.979
But that tank is just
a little hors d'oeuvre...

45:20.189 --> 45:23.604
...compared to what the country's
scientists are cooking up.

45:23.817 --> 45:26.105
So, if I have piqued your interest...

45:26.319 --> 45:28.394
...bring 1000 kilograms of gold...

45:28.612 --> 45:31.945
...to Spider Canyon
within the next four days.

45:32.157 --> 45:35.905
And now, if you'll excuse
me, I have a tank to catch.

47:19.538 --> 47:21.910
Judging from the position
of these bodies...

47:22.166 --> 47:26.210
...it laid down a 360-degree
pattern of cannon fire.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.372
I think I'm gonna be sick.

47:28.629 --> 47:29.660
My God!

47:30.506 --> 47:32.831
What kind of weapon did this?

47:33.300 --> 47:36.503
It rolls on and on, screeching
like a wounded animal.

47:36.720 --> 47:39.210
It has a cabin on top with a cannon.

47:39.430 --> 47:41.304
It swivels around
like an eagle's head.

47:41.640 --> 47:42.470
You saw it?

47:43.433 --> 47:46.719
Heard about it. I thought it
was crazy survivors' stories.

47:47.896 --> 47:49.306
Survivors?

47:49.689 --> 47:50.519
Not here.

47:50.773 --> 47:54.640
New Liberty, Illinois, a free
slave town just over the border.

47:55.694 --> 47:59.821
A week before the war ended in
'65, I was with the 9th Cavalry.

48:00.114 --> 48:04.194
We discovered old folks,
women and children slaughtered.

48:04.701 --> 48:06.907
They used them for target practice.

48:25.218 --> 48:29.216
That's when I vowed to chase
this yellow devil to his grave.

48:32.641 --> 48:34.219
What's wrong, West?

48:34.726 --> 48:36.932
I thought you'd be glad
to see me like this.

48:37.145 --> 48:39.268
Actually, I'm kind of disappointed.

48:39.522 --> 48:42.392
I was hoping to kill the
Butcher of New Liberty myself.

48:43.651 --> 48:45.310
Well, go on, shoot.

48:45.527 --> 48:47.566
Send me on to hell.

48:48.863 --> 48:52.196
But if you want the devil that's
responsible for New Liberty...

48:52.450 --> 48:54.109
...it's Loveless.

48:55.410 --> 48:57.201
He manned the machine there.

48:57.412 --> 49:00.531
He killed all them
children, old folks...

49:01.040 --> 49:03.578
...just like he killed my boys here.

49:07.504 --> 49:08.749
Where is he?

49:10.423 --> 49:11.881
Where did he go?

49:17.179 --> 49:18.886
Where's he going?!

49:19.597 --> 49:20.925
I know that.

49:23.100 --> 49:25.176
I'll tell you if you take me along.

49:25.436 --> 49:27.392
You'll tell me, or
I'll leave you here.

49:29.439 --> 49:32.642
The girls at the mansion,
you know, they talk.

49:32.900 --> 49:36.518
"I wonder if my hair will
get frizzy in the desert."

49:36.737 --> 49:40.070
"Where is this Oo-tah anyway?"

49:41.574 --> 49:43.033
Utah.

49:45.828 --> 49:47.405
Let's go, Coleman. Utah.

49:47.746 --> 49:48.991
Aye, sir.

49:54.251 --> 49:57.999
Why couldn't we give her a ride
home to Texas? It's on the way.

49:58.213 --> 50:00.205
On our way to Utah,
where our President is.

50:00.423 --> 50:02.083
How you feel about that coincidence?

50:23.025 --> 50:26.228
We wouldn't have known where
Loveless was going if not for her.

50:26.445 --> 50:28.686
Seems a bit ungracious,
if not perilous.

50:28.947 --> 50:33.324
She'd have been in our way. She
and I'd have wound up in the saddle.

50:33.909 --> 50:37.360
That's funny, I got the feeling
she was more interested in me.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.714
I've tried to place
myself in Loveless' shoes.

50:55.302 --> 50:56.880
Good luck with that one.

50:57.137 --> 51:00.054
What could a maniac with no
reproductive organs want with Rita?

51:00.890 --> 51:04.093
Which is not to say that Rita
doesn't possess a beauty...

51:04.310 --> 51:07.263
...worthy of a Shakespeare
sonnet or a Botticelli painting.

51:07.479 --> 51:09.139
The curvature of her buttocks...

51:09.398 --> 51:12.517
...and the swell of
that magnificent bosom!

51:13.067 --> 51:14.775
So full, so sumptuous...

51:15.027 --> 51:19.356
So...what were all those foreign
ministers doing at Loveless' party?

51:19.614 --> 51:22.152
This is what really puzzles me.

51:22.408 --> 51:24.697
Did you have any idea
there were so many?

51:24.952 --> 51:28.652
-How long has she been here?
-Somewhere around Botticelli's buttocks.

51:29.790 --> 51:31.284
I am profoundly sorry.

51:31.541 --> 51:35.075
I'll spare you the embarrassment.
Make a sandwich. You're getting off.

51:35.294 --> 51:38.248
I know why those foreign
guys were at Loveless' party.

51:40.257 --> 51:42.130
This is fantastic. How do you cook it?

51:42.425 --> 51:44.085
I mean, you can cut it with a fork.

51:44.343 --> 51:47.297
In a daubière. It's a clay
pot. It's a French method.

51:47.554 --> 51:49.096
Foreign ministers.

51:49.389 --> 51:52.141
They were mad about
something, you know, like...

51:52.392 --> 51:55.262
...there was some real bad
deal in Louisiana on purpose.

51:55.519 --> 51:56.634
The Louisiana Purchase.

51:57.062 --> 51:59.102
And Queen somebody of
France got swindled.

51:59.481 --> 52:00.477
Queen Isabella of Spain.

52:00.732 --> 52:03.768
This is ridiculous.
Coleman, stop the train.

52:04.027 --> 52:07.027
-Miss Escobar's getting off.
-Who the hell is Miss Escobar?

52:07.279 --> 52:11.146
A frightened, starving, half-naked
woman who wants to find her father.

52:11.533 --> 52:12.731
Half-naked?

52:12.992 --> 52:14.451
Coleman, stop the train!

52:14.702 --> 52:17.952
We're not putting anybody off
here in the middle of nowhere!

52:18.205 --> 52:19.913
Especially if they're half-naked!

52:20.791 --> 52:24.289
Please, Jim. My father's
the only family I've got.

52:24.544 --> 52:28.790
Am I to sit at home and wait for news
that he's been killed, or do something?

52:29.006 --> 52:30.001
What would you do?

52:30.215 --> 52:32.172
I don't have anything against you.

52:32.384 --> 52:36.546
What happens when we find Loveless
and you're still on this train?

52:38.180 --> 52:40.967
I know you'd never
let him take me back.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.259
I've seen you shoot.

52:44.435 --> 52:48.219
I'll assure you any attack by Loveless
would be an exercise in futility.

52:48.480 --> 52:50.888
I'll demonstrate how
my design suggestions...

52:51.149 --> 52:54.066
...have made the Wanderer
completely impervious to attack.

52:54.319 --> 52:58.268
Over here, three seemingly
innocent billiard balls, yes?

52:59.281 --> 53:04.156
Depress the number, it's a sleeping-gas
bomb effective in under three seconds.

53:04.410 --> 53:07.945
So put your mind at ease. You
are safe within these walls.

53:08.247 --> 53:10.535
I don't know about you,
but I'll sleep better...

53:10.791 --> 53:13.577
...assuming Loveless
barges in here to play pool.

53:13.793 --> 53:17.660
And speaking of sleeping,
I'm really tired, Artie.

53:17.922 --> 53:19.713
Could I borrow something to wear?

53:19.965 --> 53:22.538
-I have just...
-I got something you can wear.

53:22.801 --> 53:25.635
It ain't stylish, but it won't
explode when you put it on.

53:25.887 --> 53:27.594
That would be nice.

53:38.105 --> 53:40.394
Loveless kidnapped a
few metallurgists, so...

53:40.649 --> 53:42.855
...whatever he's
building will have armor.

53:43.109 --> 53:44.603
He kidnapped a couple chemists...

53:45.528 --> 53:46.903
...so it'll have explosives.

53:47.155 --> 53:51.068
According to you, Rita's father's the
world's foremost expert in hydraulics...

53:51.617 --> 53:53.609
...so the thing's gonna move.

53:53.827 --> 53:57.694
What could he build that'd make the
President surrender the government?

53:58.414 --> 53:59.742
A bedside heater.

54:00.916 --> 54:01.746
What?

54:02.668 --> 54:05.787
Rita needs a bedside
heater. It gets quite chilly.

54:06.004 --> 54:08.577
That's what I was talking
about. The distraction.

54:09.590 --> 54:10.752
What?

54:13.760 --> 54:17.342
Good night, and thank
you for saving me.

54:17.930 --> 54:18.879
Good night.

54:22.267 --> 54:23.097
That outfit...

54:23.310 --> 54:26.761
-Is most becoming.
-Lovely. I hope it's not too breezy.

54:26.980 --> 54:28.972
-Back there.
-But if there's anything...

54:29.190 --> 54:30.020
Anything at all...

54:30.274 --> 54:31.104
I'm right here.

54:31.317 --> 54:33.309
Aren't you boys nice?

54:33.527 --> 54:35.400
Well, sweet dreams.

54:40.741 --> 54:42.401
I told you she'd be a distraction.

54:43.243 --> 54:44.951
She's not a distraction.

54:45.203 --> 54:48.322
It's nice having her on board.
She's a breath of fresh ass.

54:49.832 --> 54:50.911
Pardon me?

54:52.167 --> 54:53.495
You said "ass."

54:53.960 --> 54:57.874
No, I said, "It's nice having her on
board. She's a breast of fresh air."

55:00.049 --> 55:01.792
Let's just get some shut-ass.

55:27.739 --> 55:29.114
We have Loveless.

55:29.574 --> 55:32.064
Seven hundred yards and closing.

55:32.576 --> 55:34.153
Maintain this speed. I'm coming up.

55:37.455 --> 55:38.830
-What's that?
-I took the liberty...

55:39.040 --> 55:41.162
...of installing that while you slept.

55:42.793 --> 55:44.999
Don't take liberties with my things!

55:45.253 --> 55:46.451
Very good.

55:46.713 --> 55:49.001
I've only made one or two
additions to your wardrobe.

56:09.482 --> 56:11.807
Am I missing something here?
