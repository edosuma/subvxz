[MOON] I did it! I'm finished!

00:33.879 --> 00:35.320
-Already?
-Yes!

00:35.480 --> 00:37.640
Ollie! Ollie, Ollie! Come here and see!

00:37.800 --> 00:40.559
Whoa! Oh, wow, Moon!

00:40.720 --> 00:43.120
It's amazing! It's perfect!

00:43.280 --> 00:46.000
I'm so glad we saved up for all this clay!

00:46.160 --> 00:49.199
It'll be so fun to have statues
of us in the garden!

00:49.360 --> 00:50.720
Are you almost finished, too?

00:50.879 --> 00:51.760
-[Gasps]
-Yay!

00:51.919 --> 00:55.360
I'm getting there!
Still have a little work to do!

00:55.800 --> 00:57.960
You know, some final touches but --

00:59.000 --> 01:00.919
[Gasps] Ollie!

01:01.080 --> 01:04.759
-You haven't even started yet?
-But I have! A bunch of times.

01:04.920 --> 01:05.800
[Sighs]

01:05.960 --> 01:07.560
Moon, I'm having trouble.

01:07.720 --> 01:11.360
I keep starting over
because I want your statue to be amazing!

01:11.520 --> 01:14.320
-As amazing as these!
-Wow!

01:14.479 --> 01:16.560
-What are those?
-They're called mo'ai.

01:16.720 --> 01:20.720
They're really old, huge statues
in a place called Easter Island.

01:20.880 --> 01:24.080
But it's kind of hard to tell
from a picture

01:24.240 --> 01:26.560
what exactly makes them so amazing.

01:26.720 --> 01:29.360
Yeah... Well, I'll get this.

01:29.520 --> 01:30.560
What? Why?

01:30.720 --> 01:33.200
Because I'm having a brainstorm!

01:33.360 --> 01:36.360
We'll go to Easter Island and
check out the mo'ai up close.

01:36.520 --> 01:37.800
I don't know, Moon.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.520
Maybe I should try my way a little longer.

01:40.679 --> 01:42.839
But you don't have much longer, Ollie.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.160
When the clay dries out,

01:44.320 --> 01:46.000
you'll be stuck with what you've got!

01:46.160 --> 01:48.759
[Gasps] How long do I have
before it dries?

01:50.880 --> 01:53.119
The package says... 12 hours.

01:54.360 --> 01:57.399
Eeep! Still I'm not sure if...

01:57.559 --> 01:59.839
-Let's go!
-OK, then.

02:06.119 --> 02:07.479
Whoo!

02:07.960 --> 02:09.519
Whee!

02:16.760 --> 02:21.560
[Stewardess]
<i>Now arriving on Easter Island. Yay!</i>

02:27.560 --> 02:30.200
-Whoa!
-Would you look at that!

02:30.359 --> 02:31.840
They're so strong-looking!

02:32.480 --> 02:34.920
Hi, mo'ai? Why the long face?

02:35.079 --> 02:37.920
Somehow they really show
what's special about the island,

02:38.079 --> 02:38.959
don't they?

02:39.120 --> 02:41.079
[Gasps] Moon! That's it!

02:41.239 --> 02:43.000
That's what my statue is missing!

02:43.160 --> 02:45.640
It needs to show what's special about you!

02:45.959 --> 02:48.880
I'll set up here. And, Moon,
could you pose for me?

02:49.040 --> 02:51.760
I think it would help me find
that special thing fast,

02:51.920 --> 02:54.959
-before the clay dries!
-You got it, Ollie!

02:57.000 --> 02:58.280
Hmm.

02:58.440 --> 03:02.359
Aw, look Ollie!
There's a little statue, too.

03:02.519 --> 03:05.320
Look how realistic the horn was sculpted.

03:05.480 --> 03:06.840
And it's so cute!

03:07.000 --> 03:09.560
-Thank you!
-Aaah!

03:10.840 --> 03:13.120
Sorry to startle you! I'm Sofia.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.840
I'm Moon and this is Ollie.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.320
We came here to see the mo'ai

03:16.480 --> 03:19.079
'cause Ollie's making
a giant statue of me.

03:19.239 --> 03:22.280
Fun! But you know
what would be even more fun?

03:22.440 --> 03:24.679
Watching the big race this afternoon!

03:24.840 --> 03:28.200
-There's a race today?
-There's a whole festival!

03:28.359 --> 03:30.920
It's called Tapati, and we dance and sing

03:31.079 --> 03:32.760
and have picnics and races!

03:32.920 --> 03:34.799
I'm just heading over
to the dance party now.

03:34.959 --> 03:36.679
-Want to come?
-We'd love to!

03:37.040 --> 03:39.799
We'd love to after I finish my statue.

03:39.959 --> 03:42.239
OK! But I'll warn you.

03:42.399 --> 03:46.079
My ukulele playing is hard to resist!

03:46.239 --> 03:47.679
See you later!

03:47.840 --> 03:49.519
But maybe not that much later!

03:49.679 --> 03:51.799
[Giggles] Bye, Sofia!

03:51.959 --> 03:53.720
She's fun. OK, Ollie.

03:53.880 --> 03:57.280
Let's do this before we run out of time.

03:57.440 --> 03:59.480
[Chuckles] You make great faces, Moon.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.320
That's what'll give my statue
that special something!

04:03.480 --> 04:04.959
Hmm.

04:08.399 --> 04:09.280
[Music starts]

04:09.440 --> 04:12.119
Uh-oh! What's that sound?

04:12.280 --> 04:14.760
[Gasps] It must be the dance party!

04:14.920 --> 04:18.440
Oh, don't you just love ukulele music?

04:18.599 --> 04:22.240
Um, Moon? Could you stay still, please?

04:22.400 --> 04:24.320
Oh. Sorry, Ollie.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.599
Um...

04:27.760 --> 04:29.640
Oops! Sorry again!

04:31.880 --> 04:32.800
You know what?

04:32.960 --> 04:35.640
Maybe you should just go dance
for a minute and come back.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.560
Really? OK!

04:42.479 --> 04:43.560
Nope.

04:44.760 --> 04:47.320
It doesn't have that special
something the mo'ais have.

04:47.479 --> 04:48.800
I'd better start over.

04:48.960 --> 04:49.880
[Sighs]

04:50.560 --> 04:53.400
OK. I'm back! That was so much fun!

04:53.560 --> 04:56.760
-Sofia's a great dancer!
-Uh-huh.

04:56.919 --> 04:58.599
Did you get all your wiggles out?

04:58.760 --> 05:01.080
Yep! Wait, hold on...

05:01.240 --> 05:03.680
Wiggle-wiggle. There was one left.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.800
I'm ready to stand still now!

05:06.159 --> 05:08.960
Thanks! Ooh! I just made a perfect ear!

05:09.120 --> 05:10.560
This is going great!

[Party sounds]

05:12.440 --> 05:14.120
What's that?

05:14.280 --> 05:18.599
Moon? If you could just
stay still and look at me?

05:18.760 --> 05:20.440
I don't have much time left.

05:20.599 --> 05:22.599
[Laughing]

05:24.719 --> 05:27.080
Drop everything! Big waves coming in!

Everybody's taking
a surfing break! Let's go!

05:30.919 --> 05:33.080
Oh! Really? Amazing!

05:33.240 --> 05:34.680
-But...
-Come on!

05:34.840 --> 05:37.200
You can sculpt down at the beach, Ollie!

05:37.359 --> 05:39.359
You can't miss this!

05:39.520 --> 05:41.640
Mmm...

05:42.760 --> 05:43.719
OK.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.640
Yay!

05:50.359 --> 05:52.120
Ollie! Ollie!

05:52.280 --> 05:54.560
Make a statue with me like this!

05:58.840 --> 06:00.520
OK. I'll try!

06:00.680 --> 06:03.240
Hmm. Moon is awfully athletic.

06:03.400 --> 06:06.000
Maybe that's something special
that I could sculpt!

06:06.159 --> 06:09.880
Hey, Moon! Bet you can't do this one!

06:10.760 --> 06:11.680
Bet you I can!

06:13.120 --> 06:16.479
[Both exclaim]

06:21.880 --> 06:24.159
She won't stay still even for a second!

06:24.320 --> 06:25.799
Not with Sofia around!

06:29.039 --> 06:30.799
How was that, Ollie? Did you get it?

06:30.960 --> 06:33.560
Not exactly.

06:33.719 --> 06:37.159
Then why don't you take a break
and come to the festival feast?

06:37.320 --> 06:41.400
-It's gonna be so yummy!
-Ooh! Feast!

06:41.560 --> 06:45.880
No! I have to get this statue
just right <i>before</i> the clay sets!

06:46.039 --> 06:49.159
And so far Moon hasn't
been still for even a minute

06:49.320 --> 06:51.680
and time's running out and I've...

06:51.840 --> 06:53.599
[Gasps] Hold on.

06:53.760 --> 06:56.680
At this feast, will everybody
be sitting still eating

06:56.840 --> 06:59.640
-for like half an hour?
-Or longer!

06:59.799 --> 07:00.880
Then what are we waiting for?

-Yay! Feasting!
-Yay! Sculpting!

07:12.039 --> 07:15.760
Now you're getting somewhere.
That's really good, Ollie.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.400
Moon has a super-special smile.

07:18.560 --> 07:21.479
All I need is for her to stay in one place

07:21.640 --> 07:23.560
long enough for me to get it right.

07:23.719 --> 07:27.000
Have you tried the yams, Moon?
They're so good!

07:29.479 --> 07:31.680
Mmm. These are deelish!

07:31.840 --> 07:35.120
They make me want to jump up
and down and shout for joy!

07:35.280 --> 07:38.200
Really? Are you sure they're that good?

07:38.359 --> 07:41.000
Maybe you could just wave your arms.

07:41.159 --> 07:43.880
-I've finished your arms.
-OK!

07:44.039 --> 07:46.359

made from banana-tree trunks!

-Oh, no! Moon's statue!
-I'm sorry, you guys!

09:13.160 --> 09:15.800
I hit a bump and lost control! Are you OK?

09:17.280 --> 09:20.280
I'm fine. But Ollie's statue isn't.

09:20.439 --> 09:23.760

and totally wrecked it.
