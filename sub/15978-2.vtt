00:03.604 --> 00:05.573
Mom, you said
you wanted to just stop by

00:05.606 --> 00:07.108
and drop something off
for Mykayla.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.209
God, we've been here so long,

00:08.242 --> 00:09.343
I feel like I need
to shave again.

00:09.377 --> 00:12.446
The something I wanted
to drop off was my knowledge.

00:12.480 --> 00:15.116
I may be retired
from teaching,

00:15.149 --> 00:17.218
but you're never really
retired from teaching.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.153
It's like the CIA.

00:19.187 --> 00:20.454
Yeah, and leave her alone.

00:20.488 --> 00:21.522
I need Mom here.

00:21.555 --> 00:24.292
The last project I helped
Mykayla with, we got a C.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.426
I don't know what it is.

00:25.459 --> 00:28.562
We dominated second grade,
but I must have gotten cocky.

00:28.596 --> 00:31.065
Third grade is...

00:31.099 --> 00:32.300
(groans)
I was trying to think

00:32.333 --> 00:34.735
of a word better than "hard"
and I can't.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.504
Why don't you guys go
down to the basement

00:36.537 --> 00:39.307
and look for an old box of
mine that says "felt props."

00:39.340 --> 00:42.276
Hopefully finding them
won't be too hard.

00:42.310 --> 00:46.114
Or difficult or
challenging or arduous.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.448
Look, Mom, I'm sorry,
but I've already been

00:47.481 --> 00:48.582
through the third grade.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.551
Twice, so...

00:50.584 --> 00:53.187
you're just gonna need
to find your own ride home.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.256
I get it; you have
a life of your own.

00:55.289 --> 00:58.226
A life I gave you,
but no one ever said

00:58.259 --> 01:00.861
that entitled me
to a ride somewhere.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.097
Oh, God.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.301
Are you seriously having
a mound of tater tots

01:07.335 --> 01:08.602
at 4:00 in the afternoon?

01:08.636 --> 01:11.539
Yup, third mound of the day.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.141
Wait a second, I'm
driving Mom around

01:13.174 --> 01:14.475
and you're eating
tater tots all day?

01:14.508 --> 01:15.709
How did we
switch lives?

01:15.743 --> 01:18.779
More importantly,
how do we switch back?

01:18.812 --> 01:21.182
If you're hungry, the garage
freezer's full of them.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.317
No, no, no! What are you doing?

01:23.351 --> 01:24.752
We're gonna have dinner in...

01:24.785 --> 01:26.454
Dad said I could!

01:26.487 --> 01:28.456
Great, I was gonna make
dinner for him at 6:00,

01:28.489 --> 01:29.557
but now our
schedule's all off.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.558
Ah-ah!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.160
These are mine.

01:32.193 --> 01:33.394
I just want one.
I'm gonna get hungry.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.329
Which would've been my concern

01:35.363 --> 01:37.331
when we were married,
but we're no longer married.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.733
So I'm no longer
invested in your hunger.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.369
They're overcooked anyway.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.603
Listen.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.806
I can make my tots
as crispy as I want,

01:45.839 --> 01:49.477
because they aren't our tots,
they're my tots.

01:49.510 --> 01:53.781
In the words of Jerry Steinfeld,
"No tots for you!"

01:59.420 --> 02:00.721
(coughs)

02:03.591 --> 02:05.393
(coughs quietly)

02:07.961 --> 02:09.463
(coughs quietly)

02:14.402 --> 02:15.903
What?
Got something on my shirt?

02:15.936 --> 02:17.205
Oh, God, oh, you...!

02:17.238 --> 02:18.539
Oh, my God, Mom!

02:22.710 --> 02:24.712
Stay away from my tots.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.221
Oh, my God,
I almost died.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.322
Yup.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.857
You gave me life,
I gave you life.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.559
Enjoy the walk home.

03:06.954 --> 03:08.822
Running out of time
for my segment.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.858
Why hasn't Janice introduced me?

03:10.891 --> 03:11.959
The weather's running long.

03:11.992 --> 03:13.761
Janice and Storm Staliano

03:13.794 --> 03:16.830
are trying to one-up each other
telling thunderstorm jokes.

03:16.864 --> 03:17.965
She's never gonna throw to me.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.967
One thing I learned about Janice
when we were married,

03:20.000 --> 03:21.835
she's always got
to have the last word.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.836
And Storm Staliano?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.406
The guy never runs out
of precipitation jokes.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.808
I got stuck in an elevator
with the guy once.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.344
Funniest five hours of my life!

03:30.378 --> 03:31.379
(laughs)

03:31.412 --> 03:32.880
She's got to throw to me.

03:32.913 --> 03:33.881
Don't worry, she will.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.048
But keep things professional.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.618
I know she's your ex-wife,
but she's also your anchor.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.953
And people are starting
to notice some tension.

03:39.987 --> 03:40.954
There's no tension on my end.

03:40.988 --> 03:41.955
(wheezing laugh)

03:41.989 --> 03:42.956
There's no tension.

03:42.990 --> 03:44.658
If there was tension on my end,

03:44.692 --> 03:46.260
I'd be weirdly laughing
right now.

03:46.294 --> 03:47.595
(crowd cheering)

03:47.628 --> 03:49.963
She's got to throw to me!
Come on, she's got to...

03:49.997 --> 03:51.465
Okay, here we go!

03:51.499 --> 03:54.034
Four, three, two...

03:54.067 --> 03:55.469
You're on!

03:55.503 --> 03:56.870
(cheering stops)

03:56.904 --> 03:57.805
Thank you, Janice.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.673
If your weather jokes
were half as fast

03:59.707 --> 04:01.342
as the bike riders
who just whizzed by,

04:01.375 --> 04:02.643
our viewers would have
gotten a glimpse

04:02.676 --> 04:04.412
of the Tour de Leesburg.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.447
Maybe there's a straggler
or two though.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.320
Nope.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.856
Oh, I'm sorry, Nathan,
if I stole your thunder.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.559
Didn't mean
to rain on your parade.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.528
(man laughing)

04:20.561 --> 04:22.463
That's hilarious, Janice.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.064
Those of our viewers
who tuned in

04:24.097 --> 04:26.634
for the Bazooka Joe-caliber
puns instead of the news

04:26.667 --> 04:27.868
must be quite excited.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.804
Maybe you and Storm should take
your act out on the road.

04:30.838 --> 04:32.873
Well, I'm sure if we do,
you'll be there

04:32.906 --> 04:35.809
to report about it
seconds after we drive by.

04:35.843 --> 04:37.711
Anything else out there?

04:37.745 --> 04:39.380
Nope.

04:39.413 --> 04:42.950
This is Nathan Miller, walking
your now empty streets.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.852
See?

04:44.885 --> 04:46.487
No tension.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.056
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

04:51.058 --> 04:53.994
I want to thank you all for
coming to this family meeting.

04:54.027 --> 04:56.764
As some of you know,
I had a scary incident recently

04:56.797 --> 05:00.434
where I was almost assassinated
by an overcooked tater tot.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.771
Which got me thinking.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.507
I no longer want to be buried
next to your father.

05:06.540 --> 05:08.008
Oh, that's too bad.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.679
I just ordered a gravestone
that says, "I'm with stupid."

05:11.712 --> 05:13.447
Um, could you guys talk
about this another time?

05:13.481 --> 05:15.349
I'm not... I'm not very good
with this topic.

05:15.383 --> 05:17.050
Yeah, Adam's a little
squeamish when it comes

05:17.084 --> 05:17.985
to the subject of death.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.052
Death bothers him.

05:19.086 --> 05:21.655
Who doesn't it bother?

05:21.689 --> 05:23.023
I'll keep it brief.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.427
A few years ago, I bought
us all cemetery plots

05:26.460 --> 05:28.496
next to each other.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.097
Please tell me those are
grandfather clocks.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.399
Uh, I'm sorry, wait.

05:31.432 --> 05:32.933
You-you got us cemetery plots?

05:32.966 --> 05:34.034
Without asking us?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.703
I thought it'd be
a nice surprise

05:35.736 --> 05:37.671
that would unfold
with every death.

05:37.705 --> 05:40.808
I went through the album
and found pictures

05:40.841 --> 05:43.977
where everybody's
eyes were closed.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.846
She's got dead dolls
of us, honey.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.981
She's got dead dolls of us!

05:48.015 --> 05:50.551
As of right now, your father
and I are in the middle.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.720
He's on the left,
I'm on the right.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.022
Because that's the way we slept
for the last 43 years.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.991
And I'm sure he smells
just about the same.

05:58.025 --> 06:00.661
And as always,
I'm sure you'll just lay there.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.433
Uh, Nathan is
obviously next to me.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.067
Obviously.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.602
CAROL:
Now, when I bought these,

06:08.636 --> 06:10.037
Janice and Nathan
were still married,

06:10.070 --> 06:12.406
so I had Janice next to him.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.475
And Debbie and Adam
are bunked up

06:14.508 --> 06:16.076
down there in the hole by Tom.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.078
Well, wait a second,
Adam and I were married

06:18.111 --> 06:20.080
five years before
Nathan and Janice.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.615
Why do we have to share?

06:21.649 --> 06:23.150
Well, I could only
buy five together.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.619
And you still brag about
the time you flew economy plus,

06:25.653 --> 06:27.921
so this should feel
luxurious to you.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.790
But it doesn't
matter now,

06:29.823 --> 06:31.892
'cause all that is
changing anyway.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.026
Okay, can we seriously
change the subject, please?

06:33.060 --> 06:35.095
Because I just...
just, death makes me...

06:35.128 --> 06:36.063
very, very uncomfortable.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.165
Yeah, man, it makes
everybody uncomfortable.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.167
What makes you think
you're special?

06:40.200 --> 06:41.635
Because I know people
that have died.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.036
Okay, my high school
principal, dead.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.138
My-my childhood mailman is dead.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.607
All my great-grandparents

06:46.640 --> 06:48.842
except for, uh,
Nanny Bananny and, uh...

06:48.876 --> 06:50.611
Could I-I please
just finish this?!

06:50.644 --> 06:52.145
Now...

06:52.179 --> 06:55.983
I want to be as far away
from your father as possible.

06:56.016 --> 06:56.950
Ditto.

06:56.984 --> 06:58.919
After that, I don't
care where anyone is.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.988
You can all decide
on your own.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.924
But it only makes sense
that Nathan's next to me.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.192
And Debbie's
next to Tom.

07:05.225 --> 07:08.061
And now Adam can have Janice's

07:08.095 --> 07:10.698
after Nathan gets her
to sign this paperwork.

07:10.731 --> 07:12.800
Uh, uh, you know what?
Mom, Janice and I

07:12.833 --> 07:14.768
have a real delicate balance
going at work right...

07:14.802 --> 07:17.204
I-I don't feel comfortable
asking her about this.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.071
I understand.
I'll do it.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.508
I haven't seen her
since the divorce.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.943
We never got a chance to
do our exit interview.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.211
You know what?
I'll talk to her.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.212
That's all right.
I got it, I got it.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.514
I'll talk to her.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.948
Great.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.182
There we are.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.253
One big, dead, happy family.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.254
Uh, okay, you know what?
That's it.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.556
I-I can't do this anymore.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.090
My babysitter's father, dead.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.560
Three of the four Golden Girls.

07:39.593 --> 07:42.129
And those ladies
practically raised me.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.834
That's amazing footage
of the newborn panda

07:46.867 --> 07:48.201
at the National Zoo.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.104
Oh, what a cute little sneeze.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.541
Hope he survives the week.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.843
Well, that's it
for this Thursday.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.010
Good night, Leesburg.

07:57.044 --> 07:59.212
Keep smiling.

07:59.246 --> 08:02.115
Can't believe my mother
got me into this.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.751
There's no way
that Janice doesn't

08:03.784 --> 08:05.218
turn this into
a big fight.

08:05.252 --> 08:06.286
I'll tell you what.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.756
Janice and I are both training
for the D.C. marathon.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.223
I'll go over there
and chat her up.

08:10.257 --> 08:12.125
You come over there,
act like you're on the phone,

08:12.159 --> 08:14.562
swoop in, get the paper signed
and swoop out.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.796
I do love a good swoop.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.832
Oh, yeah, a good swoop'll get
you out of all kinds of trouble.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.200
I once broke
my buddy's bowling trophy.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.202
Told him in a swoop,
he didn't even react.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.203
That's crazy!

08:23.236 --> 08:25.573
Somebody broke my
bowling trophy once, too.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.074
(laughs)

08:27.107 --> 08:29.176
Jansport!

08:29.209 --> 08:30.911
Ray-Ban!

08:30.944 --> 08:32.045
(laughs)

08:32.079 --> 08:33.146
How's that marathon
training going?

08:33.180 --> 08:34.882
Oh, I'm crushing the long runs.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.249
It's those midweek eight-milers

08:36.283 --> 08:38.018
I am having trouble
motivating for.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.087
Mm-hmm, you got to add
a little danger.
Okay.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.089
Put a potpie in the oven
before you leave.

08:42.122 --> 08:44.592
Make it back in 55 minutes,
you got dinner.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.026
Mm.
Drag ass,

08:46.059 --> 08:47.628
and your whole apartment
burns to the ground.

08:47.661 --> 08:48.729
(both laugh)

08:48.762 --> 08:50.230
Do not want that.
You don't want that!

08:50.263 --> 08:51.565
No! Again...

08:52.733 --> 08:53.934
Oh, hey, guys,
sorry to interrupt.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.135
This is gonna be really quick.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.705
I'm actually on the phone
right now with my chiropractor

08:57.738 --> 09:00.040
'cause I-I know
this will only take a second.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.009
Uh, back when we were married,
my crazy mom

09:02.042 --> 09:04.011
bought us all cemetery plots
without telling us.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.647
Oh, another one of your mom's
weirdly practical gifts.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.348
Is that a candy cane
in my stocking?

09:08.381 --> 09:11.184
Nope, just another rape whistle.

09:12.385 --> 09:14.354
Anyway, uh, listen.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.289
I just need to get you
to sign this...

09:16.323 --> 09:17.825
th-this form here,
releasing the plot...

09:17.858 --> 09:18.959
One second. Yeah.

09:18.992 --> 09:19.827
No, I'm still here.

09:19.860 --> 09:23.130
Sure, Wednesday at 3:30
should be fine.

09:23.163 --> 09:26.634
Isn't that just like crazy Carol
to do something crazy?

09:26.667 --> 09:28.201
Here's some advice
on those short speed runs.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.003
Okay.
What you want to do is

09:30.037 --> 09:32.039
start your bathtub
before you leave.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.240
(laughs)
I like it. I like it.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.142
You got to get back fast!
Right.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.343
Oh, sorry,
right there... ah.

09:36.376 --> 09:38.879
What?
Let's just do that.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.213
What are you doing?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.248
Just giving you
a little cushion there

09:41.281 --> 09:42.883
so you don't scratch your desk.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.719
No.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.855
What? I'm-I'm sorry, you're...

09:47.888 --> 09:50.323
Are you mad that I didn't
want you to scratch your desk?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.359
Everything always
has to be your way.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.294
Why do you always
have to be so controlling?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.363
Uh, well, I'm sorry,
Mr. Chiropractor.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.131
I'm gonna have to call you back.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.400
I don't know
what the hell's going on.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.637
Wednesday at 3:30
I'm watching Judge Judy.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.174
What are you
talking about?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.342
Oh, you always had
to control everything.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.311
Where we vacationed,
when we were gonna have kids.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.815
And the towels-- don't even
get me started on the towels.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.816
It's a perfect system.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.785
"Janice, how many times
do I have to tell you?

10:17.818 --> 10:19.419
"The most recently washed towels
have to be put

10:19.452 --> 10:21.188
"at the bottom of the stack
so each towel's used

10:21.221 --> 10:22.189
"in an even rotation.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.390
"And don't use my mousse.

10:23.423 --> 10:24.324
I ordered it from Japan."

10:24.357 --> 10:26.159
(scoffs) Look.

10:26.193 --> 10:28.128
I only do that thing
with the towels

10:28.161 --> 10:30.230
so that they wear out
at the same time.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.799
It's like the same thing
you do with underwear.

10:31.832 --> 10:32.866
Back me up
on this, Ray.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.201
Well, actually,

10:34.234 --> 10:36.369
I let my mood dictate
my underwear choice.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.404
For example,

10:37.437 --> 10:38.706
today...

10:38.739 --> 10:40.373
I'm mood-free.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.709
(laughs)

10:41.742 --> 10:43.176
Okay.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.411
You know what though?

10:44.444 --> 10:45.746
That-that thing I do
with the towels

10:45.779 --> 10:47.414
is-is the right way
to do things.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.116
You always think
your way's the right way.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
God, you are just
like your mother.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.386
I bet you even got
that towel thing from her.

10:53.420 --> 10:54.321
(scoffs):
No!

10:54.354 --> 10:56.089
We got it from
Good Housekeeping.

10:56.123 --> 10:57.290
Look, this is ridiculous.

10:57.324 --> 10:58.358
Okay?
This is ridiculous.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.727
I am not like my mother.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.729
Would you please
just sign the document?

11:01.762 --> 11:02.930
Admit you're
like your mother.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.431
No, wait.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.133
Admit we got divorced because
you're like your mother,

11:06.166 --> 11:07.334
and I'll sign it.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.202
Yeah, well,
that's never gonna happen.

11:09.236 --> 11:10.670
Well, then neither is this.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.709
(exhales)

11:15.743 --> 11:17.745
Swoop, there it ain't.

11:26.854 --> 11:29.056
Well, I'm sorry,
but I agree with Janice.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.457
You're controlling, like Mom.

11:30.490 --> 11:32.025
Even Adam calls you
Carol Jr.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.161
Well, how is being
like me a bad thing?

11:34.194 --> 11:35.162
It's a bad thing.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.797
Wait, how am I like her?

11:36.830 --> 11:37.597
Give me one specific.

11:37.630 --> 11:39.099
Okay, uh...
you and your mother

11:39.132 --> 11:40.433
are the only two
people I know

11:40.467 --> 11:41.869
who will grab
the steering wheel

11:41.902 --> 11:43.270
when you don't like
my route to the mall.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.938
BOTH: Yeah, because my way's
the right way.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.174
Oh, my God.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.743
Oh, my God, I...
I am like you.

11:49.777 --> 11:52.780
The calls were coming
from inside the house.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.083
(doorbell rings)

11:56.116 --> 11:57.985
I don't know what everyone's
complaining about.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.820
The world would be
a better place

11:59.853 --> 12:01.021
if everyone was like me.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.856
You wouldn't have
to take your shoes off

12:02.890 --> 12:06.126
at the airport,
I can tell you that.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.961
Hello.
Can I help you?

12:07.995 --> 12:09.429
I'm here for Tom.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.064
I met him through his ad.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.165
His ad?

12:12.199 --> 12:13.867
Mom, play nice.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.936
I'm just surprised
your father's dating already.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.337
Oh, I'm...

12:17.370 --> 12:20.874
Wait, are you Nathan
Miller from the news?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.976
(chuckles)
I am.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.812
You walk our streets.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.780
Yeah. I... I do.

12:26.814 --> 12:27.815
I, uh, I do.

12:27.848 --> 12:29.382
I walk your streets.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.518
Is that what
you do, sweetheart?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.055
You a bit of
a streetwalker?

12:35.088 --> 12:36.556
Mom. Mom.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.258
Are you Sylvia?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.828
Tom? Oh, it's nice
to meet you.

12:40.861 --> 12:42.329
Tom, don't be rude.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.831
Invite your date
to sit down.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.833
She's not my date, Carol.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.000
(door closes)

12:47.034 --> 12:49.002
After watching you
bully everyone around,

12:49.036 --> 12:50.938
I decided to sell
my cemetery plot.

12:50.971 --> 12:52.439
Sylvia's here
to sign the papers.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.007
Out of the question.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.408
There's where you're confused.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.910
I wasn't asking you.

12:56.944 --> 12:57.945
I see.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.080
And exactly where
are you going to be buried?

13:00.113 --> 13:03.483
As far away from you
as possible.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.019
Hawaii.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.587
You're allergic to pineapple.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.823
Maybe your ghost
will leave me alone.

13:10.891 --> 13:12.192
Ooh, Hawaii sounds nice.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.460
Adam, you love Hawaii.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.627
Yeah, well, I've
never actually been,

13:14.661 --> 13:17.164
but I have this weird thing
where I really want to go.

13:17.197 --> 13:19.166
You know, not for business,
but just for pleasure.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.001
You know, call it fate,
but my screensaver

13:21.034 --> 13:22.970
has a picture of
a beach on it

13:23.003 --> 13:24.171
that could very
easily be Hawaii.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.941
Hey, man, everybody
has that screensaver.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.876
Okay?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.410
It comes with the machine

13:30.443 --> 13:32.579
because everybody
wants to go to Hawaii.

13:32.612 --> 13:33.914
You're not special.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.983
(chuckles):
I don't know why...

13:36.016 --> 13:37.184
You two want to join me?

13:37.217 --> 13:38.451
I'll get you plots
right next to mine.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.053
Yeah. We're in.

13:40.087 --> 13:41.288
How is this happening?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.990
Sylvia...

13:43.023 --> 13:44.992
you're this apple.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.326
Come on.
Paperwork's over here.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.228
No one's signing
anything.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.897
Has everyone gone mad?

13:49.930 --> 13:51.231
Oh, come on, Mom, stop it.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.900
You see, this is why
I don't want to be like you.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.067
Because you're always
trying to force

13:54.101 --> 13:55.402
everybody to do
things your way,

13:55.435 --> 13:57.370
and it inevitably ends up
in a big fight.

13:57.404 --> 13:58.571
Well, don't blame me.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.207
They're the ones
going to Hawaii,

14:00.240 --> 14:02.375
leaving us with Janice
and this stranger.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.077
We don't even
know who she is.

14:04.111 --> 14:05.445
Who are you?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.114
I'm Sylvia Peters.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.248
I'm a seamstress.

14:08.281 --> 14:10.383
I live alone,
just me and my dogs.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.919
I foster rescues.

14:11.952 --> 14:12.920
Aw.
Aw.
Aw.

14:12.953 --> 14:13.853
Oh, relax.

14:13.887 --> 14:16.223
There's got to be
something wrong with her.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.959
What kind of person
buys a single cemetery plot?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.961
Why aren't you being
buried with your family?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.930
Well, my children live
in North Carolina.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.164
I don't see them very much.

14:24.197 --> 14:27.567
Plus, they have their own lives,
and I don't like to intrude.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.469
Aw.
Aw.
Aw.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.404
Just stop it!

14:31.438 --> 14:32.906
I wouldn't have
to control everyone

14:32.940 --> 14:34.975
if you weren't always
doing everything wrong!

14:35.008 --> 14:36.676
Buried in Hawaii?

14:36.709 --> 14:38.278
Have fun!

14:38.311 --> 14:41.614
They can't even participate
in most sweepstakes.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.351
My, she is loud.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.953
Yeah, she is, isn't she?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.955
Maybe a little too loud
to be laying next to

14:47.988 --> 14:49.622
when you're trying
to rest in peace.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.292
Don't you dare.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.527
Maybe I want to be
a little further away,

14:54.561 --> 14:56.964
next to Sylvia.
(gasps)

14:56.997 --> 14:58.098
Maybe she'll rub off on me,

14:58.131 --> 15:00.667
and I'll be a little less
controlling on the other side.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.503
I give, and I give,

15:03.536 --> 15:05.538
and this is what
I get in return?

15:05.572 --> 15:09.309
An empty grave, an
ex-daughter-in-law,

15:09.342 --> 15:11.711
an apple?

15:11.744 --> 15:15.048
An apple.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.283
Shame on you!

15:16.316 --> 15:18.318
Shame on all of you!

15:19.752 --> 15:22.422
She seems upset.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.124
Should we go after her?

15:24.157 --> 15:26.159
OTHERS:
Aw.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.433
"And that is why I think
Rihanna's dancing, singing

15:33.466 --> 15:34.968
"and lopsided hair

15:35.002 --> 15:36.736
"makes her the swaggiest
of the swaggy.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.571
"Hashtag, I just wish

15:38.605 --> 15:41.208
she wouldn't tweet so much
about smoking weed."

15:41.241 --> 15:42.475
All right.
Yay!

15:42.509 --> 15:43.476
Good, good.

15:43.510 --> 15:44.544
(phone ringing)

15:44.577 --> 15:46.179
Okay, why don't
you go upstairs

15:46.213 --> 15:48.448
and show everybody
what you're gonna wear.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.449
(clears throat)

15:49.482 --> 15:50.717
Hello?

15:50.750 --> 15:51.751
Yeah, just a second.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.986
Dad?

15:53.020 --> 15:54.221
Somebody from the cemetery.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.388
CAROL:
Oh, tell them

15:55.422 --> 15:57.024
I'm selling my plot, too.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.758
Just bury me where I drop.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.693
I don't want to bother anyone.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.395
Hello?

16:02.429 --> 16:04.064
What?

16:04.097 --> 16:05.332
No, no, no. Not related.

16:05.365 --> 16:07.667
She's just a woman
I sold my plot to.

16:07.700 --> 16:08.701
Oh.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.171
Yeah, bye.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.143
Sylvia died.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.045
Tom.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.012
Are you serious?

16:19.046 --> 16:20.680
I'm afraid so.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.016
You see that?
I knew it. I knew it.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.318
You talk about death enough,
and death will find you.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.520
Well, we have certainly
got death's attention now.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.189
I hope that you are very happy.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.591
Get ready to meet three-fourths
of the Golden Girls!

16:34.061 --> 16:35.528
Do you think Sylvia was sick?

16:35.562 --> 16:36.563
CAROL:
Of course.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.498
That's why she was buying

16:38.531 --> 16:40.133
any cemetery plot
she could find.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.134
(Debbie sighs)

16:41.168 --> 16:42.769
That poor woman.

16:42.802 --> 16:44.171
Buried alone,

16:44.204 --> 16:46.173
surrounded by people
she didn't even know.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.174
Yeah.

16:47.207 --> 16:49.309
She knew me.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.079
She knew my work.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.580
She was a fan.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.048
(chuckles)

16:55.082 --> 16:57.084
I'm surprised they
called you, Dad.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.520
She must not have been
close with her family at all.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.355
You know what?
Maybe she didn't have

17:02.389 --> 17:04.557
anybody to force them
to be close.

17:04.591 --> 17:07.060
Mom, I know that
we give you a lot of grief

17:07.094 --> 17:09.762
about being so controlling,

17:09.796 --> 17:12.165
but maybe because you're
so active in our lives,

17:12.199 --> 17:14.334
it forces us to be
closer together, and...

17:14.367 --> 17:15.668
I like that.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.737
Yeah, I like it, too.

17:17.770 --> 17:18.771
Thank you.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.475
I'll try to be
less controlling.

17:22.509 --> 17:25.178
I only do it 'cause
I love you guys so much.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.147
Aw, I love you too, Mom.
Me, too.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.448
We're saying our good-byes?

17:28.481 --> 17:29.749
(sighs)

17:38.791 --> 17:40.627
Oh, Nathan.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.495
Aw, hell, Debbie.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.264
Put us back up there.

17:44.297 --> 17:46.733
Plot's already paid for,

17:46.766 --> 17:49.602
and family should be together.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.273
Well, wait a minute.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.641
There's no room
for me and Adam.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.776
Unless Nathan can get
Janice to sign the papers.

17:56.809 --> 17:58.711
Yeah, that's not happening
any time soon.

17:58.745 --> 18:00.747
Or we could do this.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.761
We got divorced
because I'm like my mother.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.696
Could you say it one more time,
but this time,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.299
just turn and face camera.

18:19.332 --> 18:20.767
You're filming this?
Yeah.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.902
Ray?!

18:22.935 --> 18:23.770
I'm sorry, man.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.738
She offered to pay
my marathon fees.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.341
And she's throwing in
a pair of nipple guards.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.711
These puppies are
way too pretty to get raw.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.780
Action!

18:33.813 --> 18:36.683
Uh, we got divorced
because I'm like my mother.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.151
Oh.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.920
I can't wait to show this
to my therapist,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.856
my life coach,
my pharmacist-- whole team.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.794
You know what's funny, Janice?

18:47.827 --> 18:49.596
Ray, keep rolling on this.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.630
You know, I was...
I was thinking about

18:50.663 --> 18:52.465
some of the arguments
we used to have.
Mm-hmm.

18:52.499 --> 18:54.167
And as stubborn
as I might have been,

18:54.201 --> 18:55.435
you were pretty
stubborn yourself.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.770
Nah, only about little things
that you were trying to control.

18:57.804 --> 18:58.871
Like the towels.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.407
Well, it's actually
a good system...

19:00.440 --> 19:01.608
Uh, where we went on vacation.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.211
Well, you wanted to go to Haiti
during revolution season.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.279
You tried to control my uterus.

19:06.313 --> 19:07.614
Okay, you wanted
to freeze your eggs

19:07.647 --> 19:09.682
and hire a surrogate
when we were 60. 60!

19:09.716 --> 19:12.419
I read an article
that said 60 is the new 50.

19:12.452 --> 19:13.786
That's today.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.655
By the time I'm 60,
it's gonna be the new 30,

19:15.688 --> 19:16.789
and that's the perfect age
to have a baby.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.559
(laughs): I don't know why
people think that's crazy.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.827
Okay.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.729
Just admit it, Janice:
we're both stubborn.

19:22.762 --> 19:25.265
And I may be like my mother,
but so are you.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.833
And that's why we got divorced.

19:26.866 --> 19:27.934
Two Carols!

19:27.967 --> 19:30.637
And two Carols
who are never wrong

19:30.670 --> 19:31.638
don't make a right.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.939
I am not a Carol.

19:32.972 --> 19:34.741
Oh, you're a Carol.

19:34.774 --> 19:36.743
We both are. Okay?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.778
The difference is,
I'm glad I am,

19:38.811 --> 19:40.547
because if I wasn't,
I'd just roll over

19:40.580 --> 19:41.814
and be miserable my whole life,

19:41.848 --> 19:43.816
doing everything
you wanted me to do.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.853
I'd be a 63-year-old man
sitting in a hotel

19:46.886 --> 19:48.388
in a war-torn
Third World country,

19:48.421 --> 19:50.690
trying to wrestle
my toddler out of a bathtub

19:50.723 --> 19:53.893
while reaching my hand into
a stack of unevenly-aged towels!

19:55.695 --> 19:57.864
Why would our towels
be at the hotel?

19:57.897 --> 19:58.965
'Cause I was trying
to pull together

19:58.998 --> 20:01.501
a lot of specifics and it didn't
work out perfectly!

20:01.534 --> 20:02.702
Ray, tell me
you're getting this.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.537
I'm getting it!
You are on fire!

20:04.571 --> 20:05.538
Wipe your upper lip!

20:05.572 --> 20:06.873
I'm zooming in for a close-up!

20:06.906 --> 20:09.709
Okay.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.644
I'll tell you something else
about my mother.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.480
At least she has
the courage to admit

20:13.513 --> 20:15.282
that she's
too controlling sometimes.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.517
And she's trying
to turn over a new leaf.

20:17.550 --> 20:19.886
We could all learn
a little something from her.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.824
Thanks for faking your death.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.760
I know it was a hassle.

20:27.794 --> 20:28.761
No.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.463
Thank you for tracking me down

20:30.497 --> 20:32.632
after I left your house
and convincing me

20:32.665 --> 20:35.034
a real mom needs to be
more involved with her children.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.035
You were right.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.704
Of course
I was right.

20:37.737 --> 20:38.771
I'm always right.

20:38.805 --> 20:39.772
(laughs)

20:39.806 --> 20:41.474
But it was a pretty crazy plan.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.042
How did you know
it was gonna work?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.745
Sweetheart, I've been
controlling this family

20:45.778 --> 20:47.480
for 43 years.

20:47.514 --> 20:50.317
I know how these
puppets work.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.918
You're looking
at Geppetto.

20:51.951 --> 20:54.821
My daughter is gonna
be so surprised

20:54.854 --> 20:57.457
when I show up
in North Carolina.

20:58.958 --> 21:02.061
The first thing we're doing
is going to church on Sunday.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.796
I've been sitting
on the sidelines

21:03.830 --> 21:04.931
watching her and her husband

21:04.964 --> 21:08.801
monkey around with this
Judaism nonsense long enough.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.970
(engine starts)
Go get 'em, Sylvia.
