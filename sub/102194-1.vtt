If Captain Starks knew
he was impaired before duty,

12:01.590 --> 12:02.896
then this becomes
a criminal case.

12:02.939 --> 12:04.114
- Right, well, Captain Starks

12:04.158 --> 12:05.289
is currently
with his physician,

12:05.333 --> 12:06.595
but once we're done,
I'll let you know.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.292
- We'd like to test
his blood alcohol level--

12:08.336 --> 12:09.772
- Unfortunately,
you can't interrupt

12:09.816 --> 12:12.340
a patient's evaluation--
- Evaluation?

12:12.383 --> 12:14.124
So then the pilot's
not actually injured?

12:14.168 --> 12:15.822
- Look, Agent--
- Investigator.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.041
- See, that makes sense because
it's your job to investigate,

12:18.085 --> 12:20.783
and it's our job to heal.

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
So once we're done--
- Dr. Goodwin.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.395
To clarify,

12:24.439 --> 12:27.877
you're blocking access
to a key witness.

12:27.921 --> 12:30.184
- I'm helping a patient.

12:48.071 --> 12:50.334
You know, sometimes
when people are having

12:50.378 --> 12:51.901
a hard time talking,

12:51.945 --> 12:54.208
it's not because
they are scared.

12:54.251 --> 12:56.036
It's because
they're distracted.

12:56.079 --> 12:57.341
You know, their brain
keeps wandering off

12:57.385 --> 12:59.735
into the most random
pockets of life.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.825
They try to focus,
but they can't.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.088
You ever feel like that?

13:06.611 --> 13:08.831
Yeah.
We all do.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.485
But that's--
that's only part of it.

13:10.528 --> 13:13.227
The other part is that

13:13.270 --> 13:15.446
right when your brain
gets into a groove--

13:15.490 --> 13:16.621
bam!

13:16.665 --> 13:18.058
It--it's right back there.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.973
It's in Indiana.
It's in the crash.

13:20.016 --> 13:21.713
All over again.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.150
But then those
memories disappear.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.979
And you--
you try to go back to them,

13:26.022 --> 13:27.545
but your brain
wanders off again,

13:27.589 --> 13:30.244
and you can't focus,
and round and round you go.

13:30.287 --> 13:33.247
And you start to wonder
if this is what it's like

13:33.290 --> 13:35.162
to go insane.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.865
But it's not.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.562
It's trauma.

13:44.606 --> 13:48.349
And trauma is a beast.

13:48.392 --> 13:49.741
It's invisible.

13:49.785 --> 13:52.483
It's not gonna show up
on your CT, but it's real.

13:52.527 --> 13:55.095
It's as real as cancer.

13:55.138 --> 13:57.619
And just like cancer,
if it goes untreated,

13:57.662 --> 13:59.926
it'll get worse.

13:59.969 --> 14:01.797
That is a fact.

14:04.147 --> 14:05.366
But you know, Dane,

14:05.409 --> 14:08.064
all of these things
that you're feeling,

14:08.108 --> 14:10.240
I can help them go away,

14:10.284 --> 14:13.548

17:17.732 --> 17:19.473

17:19.516 --> 17:22.084

restart the elective procedures

from their doctor,

18:00.209 --> 18:01.558
violating HIPAA rules and--

18:01.602 --> 18:04.039
- As a matter of fact, we do.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.261
- What is this?
- A federal order.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.524
Issued by the United States
Department of Justice,

18:10.567 --> 18:13.918

mirror that back for you.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.296
Um, you're in treatment.
It's working.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.950
You know your dosage

Well, I'm sorry.
That sounds awful.

20:24.135 --> 20:25.789
He didn't take me
to the hospital

20:25.833 --> 20:28.052
because I was having
a delusion.

20:28.096 --> 20:30.881
It was because my response
to the delusion

20:30.925 --> 20:33.319
was to grab his gun.

And to point it at my head.

What if--
