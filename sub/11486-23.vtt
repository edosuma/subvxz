00:01.359 --> 00:04.477
Hey, Jake, why don't you tell Grandma
about your spring break.

00:04.680 --> 00:06.511
- Bad idea.
- What?

00:06.680 --> 00:10.036
Nothing. I just saw that they're moving
the L.A. Gardening Exposition...

00:10.200 --> 00:15.115
...to the Convention Center,
which I think is a very bad idea.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.232
Thanks for the update.
Go ahead, Jake, tell Grandma.

00:18.440 --> 00:20.715
- It was really cool, l...
- Hang on a second, Jake.

00:20.880 --> 00:24.270
I'm not sure you understand
how serious this gardening thing is.

00:24.440 --> 00:26.874
It's a really bad idea.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.877
I get it. Bad idea.

00:29.080 --> 00:30.672
Go ahead, Jake.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.596
I went camping
with Grandma and Grandpa.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.955
We slept in a tent,
we cooked on an open fire.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.758
And we went hiking and saw a bear.

00:37.960 --> 00:41.032
You let him spend an entire vacation
with his other grandparents...

00:41.200 --> 00:42.918
...and I haven't had him for a night?

00:43.120 --> 00:45.350
Oh, bad idea.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

01:11.360 --> 01:13.590
This is unfair and unacceptable.

01:13.760 --> 01:15.716
From the moment
that boy was born...

01:15.880 --> 01:18.474
...Judith's parents squeezed me out.
And you let them.

01:18.680 --> 01:20.238
Interesting point.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.271
Excuse me, Mom,
but when Jake was born...

01:22.440 --> 01:25.159
...Judith's mother stayed with us,
cooking and cleaning...

01:25.320 --> 01:28.118
...and taking care of him.
- Valid counterpoint.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.437
Exactly. She's a pushy, pushy woman.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.596
Personal opinion.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.597
No, no. You went on a cruise.

01:35.800 --> 01:37.870
But Judith was two days late.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.076
And I had nonrefundable reservations.

01:40.240 --> 01:42.913
Like it would have killed her
to get a C-section.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.914
Self-obsessed psychotic rant.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.271
- Mom, are you listening to yourself?
- Stupid question.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.751
Awkward silence.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.677
You wanna spend more time
with your grandson, he's right here.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.559
No. He goes to visit
his other grandparents.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.073
He should come to visit me.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.477
- So you wanna spend a week with him?
- A week?

02:08.479 --> 02:10.471
Alan, I do have a life.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.675
I'm confused.
What exactly do you want?

02:13.880 --> 02:17.919
The same quality time Jake spends
with his other grandparents.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.433
But, you know, less.

02:20.880 --> 02:24.077
I'll tell you what. Bring him
to my place around 6-ish tonight.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.470
I'll make him dinner,
we'll have a fun sleepover.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.148
- Gee, Mom, I don't know.
- Well, why not?

02:29.320 --> 02:33.359
Are you afraid one night with me
will irreparably damage him?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.234
- Yeah.
- A little.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.554
Excuse me. I didn't hear any complaints
when I was raising you two.

02:44.760 --> 02:48.878
The teenage drinking and constant
running away wasn't a slight tip-off?

02:49.080 --> 02:52.789
Oh, you were just
a little drama queen, Charlie.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.110
And let's not forget,
you always came back.

02:55.320 --> 02:58.357
Kind of hard to find steady work
when you're 9.

02:58.560 --> 03:01.120
Whatever. My place, 6-ish.

03:08.800 --> 03:13.078
Judith! I can't just leave him with you
without discussing it with his mother.

03:13.280 --> 03:16.477
Are you telling me you need to get
your ex-wife's approval...

03:16.640 --> 03:19.438
...to let your own son spend time
with your own mother?

03:19.640 --> 03:21.198
He had a really bad lawyer.

03:24.600 --> 03:28.036
You know what your problem is, Alan.
You let women walk all over you.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.270
You get that from your father.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.713
Well, nevertheless,
I still have to clear it with Judith.

03:34.920 --> 03:37.115
- Well, fine, call her.
- Right now?

03:37.880 --> 03:40.758
Well, why not?
Unless you'd rather I make the call.

03:51.840 --> 03:56.755
Probably not home. I'll just...
I'll leave a message.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.156
Yeah. Hi, Judith.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.788
Listen, it's Alan.
Call me back when you get a chance.

04:10.280 --> 04:15.912
Hello? Oh, hi, Judith,
you old call-screener, you.

04:16.440 --> 04:18.714
Listen, I just wanted
to run something past you.

04:18.920 --> 04:22.629
Jake was telling my mom about
the fun time he had with your parents...

04:22.800 --> 04:24.916
...and she thought that...

04:25.440 --> 04:28.159
What do you mean, "no"?
I haven't even asked yet.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.190
Oh, really?
Well, I've got news for you, lady.

04:31.360 --> 04:33.510
You can't say no,
she's his grandmother.

04:34.800 --> 04:37.030
Well, she may be that too...

04:37.200 --> 04:40.636
...but she's still his grandmother
and this is my weekend with him.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.191
Charlie and I turned out fine.

04:43.400 --> 04:45.470
We did too.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.189
Look, he's going, and that's that.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.679
All right then, goodbye.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.716
- It's settled. He'll be there at 6.
- Thank you.

04:54.240 --> 04:56.310
Of course, it is rather short notice.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.354
- Mom!
- Okay. Fine.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.829
But don't get used to this.

05:03.120 --> 05:05.350
I'm not your full-time babysitter.

05:10.120 --> 05:11.917
I played that wrong, didn't I?

05:12.080 --> 05:15.197
No, no. You called mom's bluff
and you stood up to your ex-wife.

05:15.360 --> 05:17.669
You maintained your self-respect,
I'm proud of you.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.674
- Yeah, but what about Jake?
- Oh, Jake.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.671
Jake's screwed.

05:26.160 --> 05:30.278
This has been the greatest day of
my life. Movies, laser tag, video arcade.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.318
Well, that's good.
I wanted today to be special.

05:33.520 --> 05:37.991
- How come?
- Just because I love you.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.792
I love you too, Dad.

05:39.960 --> 05:42.474
You know how people say
you can't buy love?

05:42.640 --> 05:44.232
I think they're wrong.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.358
You hold on to that sentiment.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.313
What's the plan for tonight?
Is it gonna be special too?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.556
Oh, God, I can't watch this.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.554
- What?
- Nothing.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.631
Oh, hey, here's $20.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.679
Wow, thanks.

06:01.880 --> 06:06.237
- You're spending tonight at Grandma's.
- Great. Wait, what?

06:07.040 --> 06:08.519
You're gonna have lots of fun.

06:08.680 --> 06:11.274
- Right, Charlie?
- This is the first I'm hearing of it.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.600
I don't want to go to Grandma's.
Here, take your money.

06:16.760 --> 06:18.671
Come on, buddy.
She loves you very much.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.319
And it's just for one night.

06:20.760 --> 06:23.638
But we were having so much fun.

06:23.840 --> 06:26.957
Think it through, Jake.
Why were you having so much fun?

06:28.560 --> 06:31.313
- You tricked me.
- Attaboy.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.996
What did I ever do to you?

06:35.360 --> 06:37.078
It's not a punishment.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.032
It's not a prize.

06:39.680 --> 06:42.194
- I'm calling Mom.
- No. No, no calling Mom.

06:42.400 --> 06:44.755
I know my rights. I get one phone call.

06:45.760 --> 06:49.196
- I've already told your mother.
- She agreed?

06:49.880 --> 06:51.916
She knows about it.

06:52.080 --> 06:54.355
Uncle Charlie,
can you get me out of this?

06:54.520 --> 06:57.910
It depends. Are you willing to live
in Mexico for a few years?

06:59.880 --> 07:03.111
Jake, please. Do it as a favor
to your grandmother, who loves you.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.073
For me. For Uncle Charlie.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.556
But most of all, for me.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.392
What do I get?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.673
What do you mean?
I spent a fortune on you today.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.838
That was because you love me.
Now you need me.

07:19.160 --> 07:22.038
Oh, God, this is a great kid.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.359
Okay. What do you want?

07:25.560 --> 07:28.120
A motorized Razor scooter,
the new Dragon Ball Z game...

07:28.280 --> 07:31.590
...an iPod mini
and not to go to Grandma's.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.550
- I'll give you three out of four.
- Okay.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.790
Forget the iPod.

07:38.120 --> 07:42.636
- This is the worst day of my life.
- Come on.

07:42.840 --> 07:45.912
You're gonna eat your dinner,
watch some videos, play some games...

07:46.080 --> 07:49.595
...and you're gonna go to bed and
we'll pick you up tomorrow. Promise.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.712
Your word means nothing to me.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.911
Hey, give your dad a break.
So he lied.

07:55.120 --> 07:59.750
You don't get the virgin to the volcano
by telling her you're gonna push her in.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.079
- Can't we just go home?
- No. Now, enough of this.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.789
- I am the adult and you are the child.
- And this is the volcano.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.197
Now, you're gonna go in there
and you're gonna have a nice evening.

08:10.360 --> 08:12.669
- Do we understand each other?
- Yes.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.914
Thank you. Now, ring the bell.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.150
So exactly what time are you...? Hey!

08:34.080 --> 08:36.674
We've done a terrible thing.

08:37.520 --> 08:42.913
Yeah. If only there was a magical liquid
that could erase bad memories.

08:46.120 --> 08:48.111
I am absolutely racked with guilt.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.838
Alan, don't beat yourself up.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.120
You're a good dad who, in a moment
of weakness, betrayed his only son.

08:55.760 --> 08:57.512
Come on, he's not in any real danger.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.711
Not physically,
but you know as well I do...

08:59.880 --> 09:04.237
...that Mom has the ability
to say things that stick with you.

09:04.680 --> 09:07.638
Yeah, forever and ever.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.951
My favorite was, " They must have
mixed you up with another baby...

09:11.120 --> 09:14.317
...because I could never have given birth
to such a hateful child."

09:14.880 --> 09:17.474
Who writes that on
a fifth-grader's birthday card?

09:18.240 --> 09:21.152
How about, " It's no wonder
your father stays at work.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.834
If I could get out of here,
I would too."

09:24.960 --> 09:28.032
Did I ever tell you about the time
I wrote my first jingle?

09:28.640 --> 09:32.349
Pepsi. I invited Mom over to watch
the prime-time network debut.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.635
For 30 seconds, 20 million people
were listening to my music.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.756
And at the end,
Mom turned to me and said:

09:38.920 --> 09:41.036
"You couldn't get Coke to hire you?"

09:41.920 --> 09:43.751
- Nice. But I can top it.
- Go.

09:43.920 --> 09:46.434
It's the day of my wedding.
She's sitting there crying.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.477
And I think it's because she's happy.

09:48.640 --> 09:51.473
Turns out it was because she was,
and I quote:

09:51.640 --> 09:55.838
"So relieved you finally found
someone who could love you."

09:58.320 --> 10:01.357
- We gotta go get Jake.
- You're right. Come on.

10:01.520 --> 10:03.272
Great game, ladies.

10:08.680 --> 10:09.954
- He'll be fine.
- Who?

10:10.120 --> 10:12.156
- Jake.
- Oh, yeah. He'll be fine.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.713
- Who?
- Jake.

10:13.880 --> 10:15.552
He'll be fine.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.472
I thought we'd eat Japanese-style.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.879
Good Lord, are you picking your nose?

10:31.080 --> 10:32.593
I had to. There was stuff in it.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.995
And where were you planning
to put it?

10:35.200 --> 10:37.873
I really didn't have a plan.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.948
Don't you dare wipe that
on my furniture.

10:41.160 --> 10:44.391
And not on your clothes either.

10:46.080 --> 10:49.277
- What are you doing now?
- Putting it back.

10:50.680 --> 10:53.752
Here, just wipe your hands.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.753
- Why?
- Because we're going to eat dinner.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.434
And you've been rooting around
in your nostril.

10:59.640 --> 11:02.234
It's okay. I don't eat with my hands.
I use a fork.

11:02.640 --> 11:05.552
- Wipe your hands.
- Okay.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.837
Thank you.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.914
Has your mother or father
ever taken you out for sushi?

11:11.080 --> 11:12.832
No. I don't like raw fish.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.798
- Well, have you ever had it?
- No.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.552
How do you know you don't like it?

11:18.000 --> 11:20.230
It's an educated guess.

11:20.440 --> 11:23.159
Well, why don't you just try it.

11:23.320 --> 11:26.232
Let's start with the tuna, shall we?
There you go.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.799
That's not tuna.

11:28.400 --> 11:29.549
Oh, yes, it is.

11:29.760 --> 11:31.876
I've had tuna.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.110
Jake, it's tuna.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.510
Now, why don't you just take
a little bite. Here.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.678
Dip it in the soy sauce first.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.269
There you go. Have a bite.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.320
You know, there's a girl at school,
Elizabeth Kurzner...

11:45.480 --> 11:48.040
...and her mom ate a bunch of sushi,
and it had worms.

11:48.200 --> 11:50.668
And they grew in her
and crawled out of her eyes.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.718
- Oh, no, they didn't.
- How do you know?

11:56.840 --> 12:00.879
- Just take a little bite.
- Okay.

12:03.840 --> 12:07.833
- Jake!
- It's gross. It tastes like worms.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.309
Jake, stop spitting on my rug.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.199
- Where do you want me to spit?
- Don't spit at all.

12:13.360 --> 12:15.476
- I gotta get the taste out.
- Have some ginger.

12:17.280 --> 12:19.396
- No, Jake, that's wasabi.
- What?

12:19.560 --> 12:21.915
Are you trying to kill me?

12:22.120 --> 12:24.111
No, Jake, don't.
That's an expensive pillow.

12:24.280 --> 12:26.396
Let... Give me that!

12:32.360 --> 12:34.157
Okay, here.

12:35.680 --> 12:36.954
I've just gotta ask.

12:37.120 --> 12:41.557
Playing volleyball on the beach every day,
don't you worry about melanoma?

12:42.160 --> 12:44.435
Alan, walk with me.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.831
Be right back.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.715
- What?
- Listen closely:

12:49.880 --> 12:54.670
No man has ever gotten into a woman's
pants chitchatting about skin cancer.

12:54.880 --> 12:57.075
You can't possibly know that.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.598
Nevertheless.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.709
Let's steer the conversation away
from tumors, okay?

13:07.920 --> 13:13.153
- Okay. So which one do you like?
- One?

13:15.560 --> 13:19.348
God, in his infinite wisdom, has given us
a big box of assorted chocolates...

13:19.520 --> 13:21.715
...and you're just gonna try one?

13:21.880 --> 13:25.839
So are you thinking, like, two?

13:26.040 --> 13:28.474
I was thinking, like, nine.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.235
- But we'll see what happens.
- You're not serious.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.599
His will be done.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.039
What else do we have to eat?

13:38.240 --> 13:41.357
You mean other than the $50 worth
of sushi in my carpet?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.312
Yeah.

13:46.160 --> 13:49.197
- I don't suppose you'd eat squab.
- No.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.116
- Do you even know what it is?
- No.

13:52.280 --> 13:56.239
But it sounds pretty creepy. "Squab."

13:56.440 --> 13:58.749
Well, what would you eat?

13:58.920 --> 14:02.037
Pretty much anything,
except sushi and squab.

14:02.200 --> 14:03.679
Squab, squab.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.910
Squab, squab, squab,
squab, squab, squab...

14:06.080 --> 14:08.548
- Stop it.
- Sorry.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.078
Squab.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.278
Would you eat spaghetti?

14:16.480 --> 14:18.277
- I love spaghetti.
- Great.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.000
Would you prefer vermicelli or linguine?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.472
Spaghetti.

14:24.600 --> 14:28.070
All right. What would you like on it?

14:28.240 --> 14:32.870
Puttanesca, Bolognese, Milanese,
olive oil with truffles?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.271
How about squab?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.991
I'm just kidding. Ketchup.

14:39.680 --> 14:41.955
- Of course.
- And sliced-up hot dogs.

14:42.640 --> 14:45.791
Unbelievable.
My grandson is a hillbilly.

14:51.080 --> 14:54.868
You know, I'm thinking we should
move this party over to my place.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.036
But we've been playing
volleyball all day.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.679
We're all sweaty and sticky.

14:59.200 --> 15:02.033
No problem.
<i>Mi</i> shower <i>es su</i> shower.

15:02.680 --> 15:06.195
- What?
- I have a shower.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.672
- Good. You live alone?
- Pretty much.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.389
My brother stays with me and he's got
a kid, but he's at his grandmother's.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.636
Oh, that is so sweet.

15:16.840 --> 15:18.512
Yeah, well, we're sweet people.

15:19.760 --> 15:23.150
I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.558
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

15:25.720 --> 15:28.837
I was raised by my grandma.
I called her Nana.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.752
Oh, yeah.
She was a big influence on me.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.798
She raised me. I called her Nana.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.471
Oh, Jake, what have we done to you?

15:46.560 --> 15:49.757
Dinner, such as it is, is served.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.276
Jake? Where are you?
Come into the dining room!

15:53.960 --> 15:56.030
Squab!

16:09.160 --> 16:12.277
Alan. Alan, I'm worried about the kid.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.597
What kid?

16:15.760 --> 16:18.752
Your kid. Our kid. I think we should
go to Mom's and get him.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.117
Oh, come on, he's fine.
And it's just for one night.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.750
Which, by the way, is rapidly becoming
one of the best nights of my life.

16:27.440 --> 16:30.671
And grind, and grind.
And step and step and turn.

16:30.840 --> 16:32.990
Alan. Alan, please.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.111
Hey, if you're worried,
why don't you call.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.909
And grind, and grind.
And grind and grind and grind.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.839
- What's her number?
- You don't have her on speed dial?

16:42.040 --> 16:45.555
Hey, if I can't eat it, bang it
or bet on it, it's not in my phone.

16:47.920 --> 16:49.638
It's ringing.

16:49.840 --> 16:54.072
And grind, and grind.
And I'm a lucky boy.

16:55.720 --> 16:57.073
Hello? Mom?

16:57.280 --> 16:59.396
I can't talk to you now, Charlie.

16:59.560 --> 17:02.711
Get that out of your mouth.
Are you an animal?

17:03.440 --> 17:06.113
Mom? Hello? Hello?

17:06.319 --> 17:10.632
And grind, and grind.
And step and step and...

17:13.280 --> 17:14.679
You don't understand, Charlie.

17:14.880 --> 17:18.839
It was a women's volleyball team
and I could've been the volleyball.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.555
- Get your priorities straight, will you?
- I've got my priorities straight.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.832
I've had a kid for 11 years,
but I've never had group sex.

17:26.520 --> 17:29.398
Alan, you didn't miss anything.
It's an overrated male fantasy.

17:29.600 --> 17:32.558
- Really?
- No, are you kidding?

17:38.440 --> 17:40.351
He'd better be scarred for life.

17:45.160 --> 17:48.277
- Mom?
- Oh, hello, boys.

17:49.040 --> 17:50.951
What happened? Where's Jake?

17:51.160 --> 17:52.479
I sent him up to take a bath.

17:52.640 --> 17:54.790
He had hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair.

17:56.120 --> 17:58.998
Why would he have hot dogs
and spaghetti in his hair?

17:59.200 --> 18:01.430
Because he wouldn't eat squab.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.077
Squab.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.111
- What are you guys doing here?
- We wanted to see how things were.

18:09.680 --> 18:12.274
- They're okay.
- See, he's fine.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.749
- Let's go back to the bar.
- And take me with you.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.070
- Jake?
- Yeah?

18:26.680 --> 18:29.069
Did you turn the water off
in the bathtub?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.270
- Say goodbye to Grandma.
- Goodbye, Grandma.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.959
Night, Mom.

18:52.320 --> 18:56.871
You realize that in one night,
he did what we couldn't do in a lifetime.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.477
He broke her.

19:00.000 --> 19:03.037
He chewed her up and spit her out.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.356
It was a beautiful thing.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.752
I'm gonna be truthful here, Alan.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.639
I always thought your kid
was a little bit of a simpleton.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.359
Me too.

19:13.560 --> 19:17.189
But clearly, he is the chosen one.

19:18.120 --> 19:19.394
Hey, guys, check it out.

19:19.560 --> 19:20.629
Pull my finger.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.313
Okay.

19:25.520 --> 19:28.239
And they shall call him Jake.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.831
