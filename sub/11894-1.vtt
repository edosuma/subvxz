00:55.960 --> 00:58.793
- Whoa.
- What a wild kickflip wallplant!

00:58.920 --> 01:01.036
It takes me back to my boarding days.

01:01.120 --> 01:03.873
Funny. Cos I feel like
the only boarding you did

01:03.960 --> 01:07.077
was with Charlie and Henry
and the horrid biscuit game.

01:07.160 --> 01:08.878
Oh, OK, yeah, fair point.

01:09.560 --> 01:12.279
The competition has been amazing.
The girls were great.

01:12.360 --> 01:15.796
But the one everyone is talking about,
Kim Matthews, is still missing.

01:15.880 --> 01:20.158
We've actually got some footage of her
as an early skateboarding prodigy.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.356
Kim started competing
when she was seven.

01:22.440 --> 01:24.271
She won the National
Mixed Under-16s

01:24.360 --> 01:26.112
when she was just 11 years old.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.156
I mean, attractive girl even then.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.118
- Really? Because I said 11.
- Yeah, objectively.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.792
Two years ago, aged 17,

01:32.880 --> 01:34.154
she won the London Trials.

01:34.240 --> 01:37.232
Mum and Dad supported her

01:37.320 --> 01:38.639
with parental pride

01:38.720 --> 01:40.676
and simplistic homemade signs.

01:40.760 --> 01:43.638
Then nothing. We haven't seen her since.

01:43.720 --> 01:45.676
There was an accident, Rick.

01:45.760 --> 01:48.558
The car crash, when she lost her mum.

01:48.640 --> 01:51.518
We're thinking of you, Kim.
Wherever you are,

01:51.600 --> 01:55.912
whatever you're doing, we hope
you're riding high and living the dream.

01:56.000 --> 01:59.072
two for one on onion rings.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.559
Onion rings, two for one.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.995
Please don't push.

02:10.240 --> 02:13.118
- I thought it was junk mail.
- Big red letters.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.668
"Not junk mail."
It says "Urgent Demand" on it.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.150
- They always say that. It's hardly...
- It's nearly a grand.

02:21.920 --> 02:24.593
Dad, you can't just ignore it.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.229
But, hey, we're big hitters, right?
We'll just sell the Bentley.

02:28.320 --> 02:32.518
Oh, no, someone's stolen the Bentley.
Plan B?

02:32.600 --> 02:35.239
They're bluffing.
I'll think of something.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.118
How are you getting on?

02:40.200 --> 02:43.192
No. Nothing yet.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.995
- I'll talk to Les. Sort something out.
- What would I do without you?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.593
Fester.

02:51.120 --> 02:52.792
Hmm!

02:52.880 --> 02:58.034
My rota is... full.

02:58.120 --> 03:02.079
Maybe if you're extra nice to me? Hmm?

03:02.160 --> 03:05.357
Oh, Les, don't be a cock all your life.

03:05.440 --> 03:07.396
That's your extra nice?

03:07.480 --> 03:10.677
How did my summer job
become the rest-of-my life job?

03:10.760 --> 03:14.116
A friend of my cousin's
just got into this well-good scam.

03:14.200 --> 03:20.036
Catering agencies. Serving champagne
and tiny food to toffs. £12.50 an hour.

03:20.920 --> 03:26.119
Hmm. Toffs and champagne
or Les and... Urgh.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.988
I can get the number if you want.
You gotta be posh, though.

03:30.080 --> 03:34.278
Posh? Trace, I can do posh.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.716
- Hi, I'm Arabella.
- I'm Henrietta.

03:37.800 --> 03:41.110
- Isabella.
- Petronella.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.389
Kim.

03:43.480 --> 03:46.153
White wine? Yes.

03:46.240 --> 03:47.798
Red wine?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.871
Yes.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.036
Dessert wine?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.269
No.

03:54.360 --> 03:57.875
§  Is it true what they say
about posh girls?

03:59.160 --> 04:02.596
§  Is it true what they say
about posh girls?

04:04.680 --> 04:06.079
Shit.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.398
You're a lovely girl,
but I'm just not sure.

04:11.480 --> 04:13.710
Let me try. You're just not sure

04:13.800 --> 04:16.154
I'm the right kind of girl
for your clients.

04:16.240 --> 04:18.435
It's hard to say why exactly,

04:18.519 --> 04:21.796
but it's probably to do with the fact
that I'm not called Arabella

04:21.880 --> 04:24.030
or Isabella or anything-bella.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.839
I don't have hundred-quid highlights,
perfect nails

04:26.920 --> 04:30.151
or, I'm just guessing here,
expensively trimmed pubes.

04:30.240 --> 04:31.992
So even though I'm the only person

04:32.080 --> 04:35.356
with actual experience of actual work
in the actual real world,

04:35.440 --> 04:40.116
and you know
I'd try really, really hard,

04:40.200 --> 04:43.112
I'm just not the right kind of girl.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.752
- Is that about the size of it?
- About there, yes.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.679
This is Bella.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.910
She did what?

04:58.000 --> 05:01.390
Oh, for God's sake, the silly cow.

05:01.480 --> 05:05.678
Yes, it's the day after tomorrow.
Everyone's booked out.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.077
Wait there,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.789
er,... Kim.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.836
- It sounds great.
- I said no.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.115
- What was the job?
- Cooking and cleaning.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.430
Same as I do at work.
Same as I do here.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.592
- Was the pay rubbish?
- No, it's better. Double, plus tips.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.478
But... But still...

05:25.560 --> 05:27.516
But still what?

05:27.600 --> 05:31.149
It's in a ski chalet. In Austria.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.959
For four months.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.749
- Right. Well, I'm sure I could...
- You couldn't.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.753
I'd come home and find a skeleton
on the couch holding the remote.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.353
That's a bit harsh.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.193
- Totally the right decision.
- You think so?

05:47.280 --> 05:52.115
Yeah. What's a luxury chalet with hot,
rich clients in a beautiful ski resort

05:52.200 --> 05:54.668
got on this place? It's a no-brainer.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.548
- Oi, I found this toenail in my...
- Don't even try.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.474
See? Would you get that kind of
quality entertainment in Austria?

06:02.560 --> 06:04.437
I don't think so.

06:12.480 --> 06:16.029
Hi, it's Kim Matthews from yesterday.
I was wondering if you're still...

06:16.120 --> 06:18.998
Still desperately seeking
a chalet girl? Yes, I am.

06:19.080 --> 06:20.718
- You are?
- Could you do it?

06:20.800 --> 06:24.076
You have to be there tomorrow.
It's ten hours on the overnight train.

06:26.880 --> 06:29.633
Right. I'm making freezer food
to last until April.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.472
You know how the microwave works?

06:31.560 --> 06:34.199
It's a magnetron
that converts electricity...

06:34.280 --> 06:37.431
- No, no, no. Like on, off?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:37.520 --> 06:40.956
What am I doing? I'm packing you off
to some mountainous wasteland,

06:41.040 --> 06:43.349
while I'm stuck here looking for a job.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.079
It'll happen,
as long as you keep trying.

06:46.160 --> 06:48.833
- But you're only 19.
- Exactly! I'm 19.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.717
It's Austria. Hardly a wasteland.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.792
Austria. Famous for
"The Sound of Music", breaded food

06:53.880 --> 06:56.633
and the invention of psychoanalysis.
You join the dots.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.553
You're such a freak.
No wonder nobody will hire you.

07:01.280 --> 07:04.272
- And you won't forget to have a bath?
- Every month.

07:04.360 --> 07:06.396
I give up.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.595
And what exactly am l
supposed to do with this?

07:37.680 --> 07:39.989
- What is it?
- You can't live on beans on toast.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.913
We won two world wars
and one World Cup on beans on toast,

07:43.000 --> 07:44.069
so don't knock 'em.

07:44.200 --> 07:47.078
I've set it up online,
so you'll get a delivery every week.

07:47.160 --> 07:50.311
Lexi, this is my health-freak dad, Bill.
Bill, this is Lexi.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.960
I'm trusting you to keep him alive
till I get back, OK?

07:53.040 --> 07:55.190
Shit.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.157
My pay goes into the mortgage account.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.390
I'll send any tips back.
Any envelopes...

07:59.480 --> 08:02.631
Big red letters. I know.
Now hurry up, you'll miss your train.

08:04.160 --> 08:08.278
- Maybe this isn't a great idea.
- Go, now.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.312
- I love you, Kimberley.
- I love you, William.

08:18.240 --> 08:19.719
Bye, Dad.

08:24.840 --> 08:27.877
See you later. Auf Wiedersehen.

08:40.240 --> 08:43.994
Oh, my God, I'm never doing that again!
I can't remember the whole night.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.798
Honestly.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.316
Oh, my God, did you see that guy
staring at my tits the whole night?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.674
It was so awkward.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.753
He was such a perv. And he had a hairy
chest and everything. Can you imagine?

08:54.840 --> 08:57.638
Yeah.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.631
Can I call you back, babes?

09:04.600 --> 09:07.558
- Seriously?
- Yep.

09:08.800 --> 09:12.031
OK, let's go. Put your bags
in the back and get in.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.276
Shit.

09:27.880 --> 09:30.553
Oh, my God, they're huge.

09:30.640 --> 09:34.997
Yeah, they're mountains.
Huge is part of the concept.

09:35.080 --> 09:38.117
You don't even ski, do you?
What are you doing here?

09:38.200 --> 09:43.877
- It's a job. I need to earn money.
- Earn? What, as in, like, "save"?

09:57.160 --> 09:59.628
- Oh.
- Thought I recognised that arse.

09:59.720 --> 10:03.235
- Alright, ugly. You coming out?
- Yeah. Just dumping the new girl off.

10:03.320 --> 10:06.630
- The new girl! Let me see.
- Kim, Jules. Jules, Kim.

10:06.720 --> 10:08.870
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.309
- I'll see you later, babes.
- See you later, babes.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.557
It's a bit poky, isn't it?

10:35.640 --> 10:38.438
So is this guy
head of some evil criminal empire?

10:38.520 --> 10:40.909
- He's a banker.
- That's a yes, then.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.877
- You don't get it, do you?
- Get what?

10:42.960 --> 10:44.916
This is the best job in the Alps.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.470
They use the place to entertain clients
plus a few family weekends.

10:48.600 --> 10:50.955
Apart from that,
they're hardly ever here.

10:51.040 --> 10:55.556
I had 30 girls texting me after Milly
broke her leg, begging me for the job.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.313
But the agency said it had to be
someone they'd seen.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.631
You know what's really funny is,
I wasn't going to take it at first.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.678
OK, maybe not really funny but...

11:04.760 --> 11:08.116
Do what I tell you and if
you're not up to it, I will tell them.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.953
Listen, a week ago I was
mopping up puke in a burger bar.

11:11.040 --> 11:16.558
No, you listen, little Miss Essex
no-coat, non-skiing freak show.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.358
I'm not actually from...

11:18.440 --> 11:21.830
The Madsens fly in at five.
They expect perfection from the start.

11:21.920 --> 11:26.198
Now, if you screw up or, more
importantly, if you make me look bad,

11:26.280 --> 11:30.956
then clearing up puke will be a fond
memory of the good old days. Got it?

11:31.040 --> 11:32.951
Oh!

11:34.000 --> 11:35.228
Got it.

11:37.080 --> 11:39.116
So I'll just make myself at home, then.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.758
§  Farmer in my own farm

11:58.840 --> 12:01.593
§  In, out and far

12:02.600 --> 12:05.478
§  From the high ceilings

12:59.000 --> 13:01.230
- Look out!
- Hey!

13:27.240 --> 13:28.753
It's a total nightmare.

13:28.880 --> 13:31.519
It's not like you've got to spend
the next four months

13:31.600 --> 13:33.192
sharing a room with her.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.193
- Oh, no, wait, you have.
- I'm serious, babes.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.193
It's like she's never seen snow before.
It's like she's from Africa.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.556
A chalet girl who can't ski.
That's classic.

13:44.640 --> 13:48.349
- Tell me about it. Later, babes.
- Later, babes.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.709
The three golden rules
of chalet-girling.

13:55.800 --> 13:57.836
One, no friends up in the chalet.

13:57.920 --> 14:02.232
Two, party all you like, as long as
breakfast is on the table at eight.

14:02.320 --> 14:05.995
- You oversleep, you pack your bags.
- Friends, breakfast, check.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.435
Three, no sleeping with the clients.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.399
Unless they're fit. Or minted.
Or hitting on you.

14:12.480 --> 14:17.759
- Basically, there's only two rules.
- Basically, yeah.

14:18.320 --> 14:20.629
We're just going to get
the essentials for now.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.631
Right, so shall I go and get the veg?

14:22.720 --> 14:25.837
Six tins of caviar, please. Beluga.

14:25.920 --> 14:29.196
Caviar, right. Of course.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.477
I'm more front-of-house type,
you're more back office.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.278
Because I know how to talk to them.

14:34.360 --> 14:37.352
Yeah, I don't speak much posh.
Dropped it after GCSEs.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.073
- Do you want to prep the veg?
- I live to prep veg.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.549
Right, carrots,
we've got a big game coming up.

14:43.640 --> 14:46.950
I want to see each and every one of you
giving 110 per cent.

14:47.040 --> 14:48.712
Are you done?

14:48.800 --> 14:51.155
Yeah. I thought you said
they landed at five.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.073
I did. But the pilot called.
They ran into some headwind.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.391
Oh, right... The who called?

14:58.600 --> 15:00.875
- God, he's here already.
- Who?

15:01.000 --> 15:04.037
The owners' all-round ski guide,
fixer and gimp.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.159
Kim, meet the very handsome,
very powerful Bernhardt.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.956
- You're late.
- Did I mention very charming too?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.918
- Is this the new Hausmädchen?
- Hi.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.913
Hey, welcome!

15:25.680 --> 15:30.151
- So, who is everyone?
- Oh, you'll figure it out.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.915
You know, you're going to have to stop
being so helpful all the time.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.557
Rule three. Anyway, he's taken.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.030
- Turned you down, did he?
- No.

15:46.120 --> 15:50.193
So, what's the deal?
How do l, you know, talk to them?

15:51.480 --> 15:55.268
You don't talk to them.
You don't look them directly in the eye.

15:56.720 --> 15:59.518
- And curtsey when you meet them.
- Oh.

15:59.600 --> 16:02.558
- Alright, needle cock?
- You old slapper.

16:02.640 --> 16:06.349
- You OK down there?
- Yeah, yeah, just... stretching.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.796
- Right. Is this the new helper?
- Er, something like that.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.472
Hi, I'm Kim.

16:12.560 --> 16:15.154
Jonny. And I don't actually have
a needle cock.

16:15.240 --> 16:18.789
- He did when he was ten.
- Hey.

16:18.880 --> 16:20.836
I'm so excited to be back! Hi!

16:20.920 --> 16:23.150
- Hey, Chloe.
- How are you?

16:23.240 --> 16:25.834
- This is Milly's replacement, Kate.
- Kim.

16:25.920 --> 16:28.150
This heartbreaker is her brother Nigel.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.438
- Nigel. The famous Nigel.
- He really does have a tiny cock.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.513
Hey, it's not what you got,
it's about where you put it in...

16:39.080 --> 16:41.150
Please ignore him.

16:41.240 --> 16:43.515
This is my dad Richard,
"Call me Dickie."

16:43.600 --> 16:44.999
Are you following this?

16:45.080 --> 16:47.719
- Dad, this is Kim.
- Call me Dickie.

16:47.800 --> 16:50.872
Thank you for stepping in.
Just do whatever Georgie does.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.598
Except that thing with her chin.

16:52.720 --> 16:55.029
- We liked that, didn't we?
- That was a one-off.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.759
- Speaking of one-offs...
- Hey!

16:57.840 --> 16:59.319
Hello.

16:59.400 --> 17:01.834
This is my wife Caroline.

17:03.760 --> 17:06.637
Who apparently has a throat infection.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.392
- Help us with the bags?
- Ah, yes.

17:11.280 --> 17:13.077
- Ahem.
- Give her a chance.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.594
I didn't say anything.

17:22.040 --> 17:25.749
And lovingly topped off
with gravy, à la me.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.317
Back office.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.232
Wouldn't want to steal your thunder
with the sprouts.

17:37.240 --> 17:39.037
Oh, brilliant. Look at that!

17:50.240 --> 17:56.349
Ibble dibble number one, with 12 ibble
dibbles calls ibble dibble number...

18:01.280 --> 18:03.589
There. Right there.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.671
Mmm! I want to be a profiterole.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.637
So these guys fly in on a private jet

18:10.720 --> 18:14.076
and their idea of fun is rubbing
a burnt cork on each other's faces?

18:14.160 --> 18:15.718
That's insane.

18:15.800 --> 18:19.509
Sanity's overrated.
Tried it once, didn't get it.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.792
Join in. We don't bite.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.395
Well, my mum bites a bit. The rest of us
just nibble ibble dibble...

18:27.480 --> 18:28.913
Talking crap.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.434
- You! It's time.
- No, there's absolutely no way.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.750
- Yes! Yes!
- I don't want to!

18:35.640 --> 18:38.438
Georgie! Georgie! Georgie! Georgie!

18:38.560 --> 18:40.551
OK, OK.

18:40.640 --> 18:42.039
Hark! The Herald.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.309
Ooh.

18:57.960 --> 19:00.599
- Go, go, go.
- Oh, Nigel.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.999
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.397
See now, this is my idea of fun.
You should join in.

19:08.520 --> 19:11.318
§  Hark! The herald angels sing

19:11.400 --> 19:15.234
Unfortunately I'm only grade one
at... whatever that is.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.038
Yeah!

19:19.120 --> 19:22.669
- You eating alright?
- Five a day. How's it going?

19:22.760 --> 19:25.320
- It's fine.
- What are the people like?

19:25.400 --> 19:27.311
They're...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.197
Who wants more champagne?

19:29.280 --> 19:30.872
..fine.

19:30.960 --> 19:34.191
If it doesn't work out, I can
always nick one of their paintings.

19:34.280 --> 19:36.236
What's that noise?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.629
Oh, nothing, er...

19:38.720 --> 19:42.474
No, it's next door.
There's a truck reversing,

19:42.560 --> 19:44.118
I think.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.990
Listen, Kimmy,

19:48.080 --> 19:49.593
I really miss you, you know?

19:49.680 --> 19:52.911
I know, Dad. Me too.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.792
Georgie? Georgie?

20:03.840 --> 20:05.353
It's seven.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.194
Rule two?

20:17.400 --> 20:19.960
- Is this caviar?
- Sure looks like it.

20:20.040 --> 20:24.830
Well, dig in, everyone,
and enjoy your $300 omelettes.

20:26.560 --> 20:31.680
Jesus, Kim. You have to wake me.
I don't need you making me look bad.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.115
No kidding.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.760
So what am I supposed
to do all day, then?

20:36.840 --> 20:42.039
I don't know. I'm sure
you'll find something. Look around.

21:10.040 --> 21:11.268
Oh, shit.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.311
Wait! Stop!

21:31.360 --> 21:33.874
- Georgie, this cake is supreme.
- Thank you, Jonny.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.871
Hm-hmm! Sure is.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.878
- This place is so magical.
- It is when you're here.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.997
Enjoy it. You won't ski this much
when you're starting a family.

21:42.080 --> 21:45.197
- Do I get a say in any of this?
- No, snoogles, you don't.

21:45.280 --> 21:48.750
I'm not sure I'm ready for any of this.
Do I look like a grandfather?

21:48.840 --> 21:51.115
Don't answer that!

21:52.480 --> 21:54.914
Thank you. Ooh.

21:57.920 --> 21:59.399
That's hot!

22:14.520 --> 22:19.389

Watch where you're going!

22:51.680 --> 22:53.398
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

22:53.480 --> 22:56.313
Stay safe, Betty Boop.
Hang outside on the ripside!

22:56.400 --> 23:00.916
- Yeah, and in English?
- Hang outside on the ripside.

§  Come on and try a little topsy-turvy
back-to-front the right way round

23:38.840 --> 23:41.354
You blow at boarding.
But you sure are styley.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.908
I'll take it you're not
into pink all-in-ones?

23:48.640 --> 23:53.953
- Mikki. Single guy from Finland.
- Kim. Not interested from England.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.913
- You know the skateboarding?
- A bit.

23:58.040 --> 24:00.395
Same, same, but different.
You want some help?

24:02.480 --> 24:05.074
- Yeah.
- OK, come on, get up.

24:07.800 --> 24:12.271
OK, in skateboarding, weight back.
In snowboarding, weight centred.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.790
OK. Right.

24:15.880 --> 24:17.518
- Knees.
- OK.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.953
Turn with your shoulders,
not the knees.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.876
You're a natural.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.718
It's like skateboarding, huh?

24:27.840 --> 24:29.114
Whoo-hoo!

24:31.960 --> 24:34.679
- That was pretty cool.
- That was nothing, Betty.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.512
Let's get high.

24:36.600 --> 24:38.079
Up.

24:38.200 --> 24:41.317
Oh. No, I can't. I'm on the budget tour.

24:41.400 --> 24:43.914
Betty... Follow me.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.996
Hey, look. That's the biggest
snowboarding competition in Tyrol.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.755
Every year I enter,
every year I face-plant.

25:01.840 --> 25:03.910
But this year I rock it!

25:04.000 --> 25:06.150
Hey, we'll enter together.

25:06.280 --> 25:08.475
Why? Because I'm such a pro boarder?

25:08.560 --> 25:10.676
Three months, maybe.

25:10.760 --> 25:13.399
Maybe, maybe not.

25:13.480 --> 25:17.234
Come on. $25,000. It's easy for you.
You're a skateboarder.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.198
I pulled a 360 my first day on a board.

25:20.320 --> 25:23.392
- And broke your neck, right?
- No. My leg.

25:24.800 --> 25:27.394
Just so you know,
I've given Jonny your mother's ring.

25:27.480 --> 25:31.155
That's a coincidence. I've given him
one of her dresses. He'll look lovely.

25:31.240 --> 25:33.879
It is not funny.
The marquee is pencilled for June.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.713
It was quite funny.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.997
Didn't you get the message?
You're joining us. Dress up.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.478
I... did.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.437
Don't worry. She made me change too.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.752
Drainpipe jeans and winkle-pickers
aren't very this season apparently.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.671
You were never a style guru.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.478
I was.

25:56.720 --> 25:58.870
Lippy.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.399
Liner.

26:00.480 --> 26:01.993
Lashes.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.991
Accessories.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.433
I want those back.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.557
And... hair gum. Use sparingly.

26:08.640 --> 26:10.358
Hair gum?

26:19.160 --> 26:20.752
And like that, she became a swan.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.751
So I used to be an ugly duckling, then?

26:22.840 --> 26:25.400
Someone needs to learn
how to take a compliment.

26:26.960 --> 26:30.396
- Ah, it all makes sense now.
- Yeah. I'm just back office.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.872
- It's a shoelace.
- Er, it's bow tie.

26:39.000 --> 26:42.356
No, it's a shoelace knot. Come here.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.436
Didn't think you'd be the kind of girl
who knew how to tie a bow tie.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.432
And here's me thinking
you were the kind of boy who would.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.035
Big night for you, then?

27:08.360 --> 27:10.590
There.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.671
Licensed to kill.

27:14.280 --> 27:16.919
Or be killed.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.515
Right, who needs a drink?

27:30.200 --> 27:34.910
- Oh, Georgie. What are these?
- Mini-burgers. Don't blame me.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.713
They are sensational.

27:37.800 --> 27:40.394
- Trying to get me drunk?
- Just helping you on your way.

27:40.480 --> 27:42.357
Greasing your nuts, as it were.

27:42.440 --> 27:45.193
- Rule three?
- Oh, shut up.

27:46.240 --> 27:48.151
What are you grinning at?

27:48.280 --> 27:51.397
Nothing. Just think
I'm starting to get the hang of this.

27:51.480 --> 27:55.314
The cake's on the oven. The beef
is nearly done. And the mousse has set.

27:55.400 --> 27:57.231
Oh, thank you.

27:59.440 --> 28:01.396
Thank you.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.119
- Wow. Did you hear what...
- Yeah, don't get used to it.

28:04.240 --> 28:06.151
Get a fresh one of these.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.708
Such responsibility.
Do I get a performance star?

28:08.800 --> 28:10.791
- What?
- Doesn't matter.

28:20.520 --> 28:22.476
Chloe, you look wonderful.

28:28.640 --> 28:33.111
Oh, look. Looks like the new girl's
putting on pre-dinner entertainment.

28:33.200 --> 28:35.634
Oh, dear, stand back.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.869
Kim, wait. Kim...

28:40.960 --> 28:43.315
What a waste. That's vintage.

28:49.240 --> 28:52.516
Doctor's orders. The good news is,
you've already got the headache,

28:52.600 --> 28:54.318
so you can drink as much as you like.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.789
- I should go and help Georgie.
- I wouldn't worry.

28:56.880 --> 28:59.838
- I think Nigel has her covered.
- Thanks.

29:04.600 --> 29:09.151
- Hit the spot.
- Yeah, it should. '62 Dom.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.437
- Dom?
- It's 500 quid a bottle.

29:12.520 --> 29:16.638
500? Think I'll just take the cash
next time.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.228
Why am I here?
I'm stuck in a parallel reality

29:21.320 --> 29:24.039
where people drink my monthly salary
every ten minutes.

29:24.120 --> 29:28.477
You're right. We're aliens.
My mother has a tail. Did you see it?

29:28.560 --> 29:30.755
Your mum is the scariest woman
I've ever met.

29:30.840 --> 29:34.071
You want to know how she met
my dad? Air stewardess. Concorde.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.833
Your dad was an air stewardess?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.628
She's not that scary.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.197
Well, look, I should be getting back.

29:44.280 --> 29:48.592
Yeah, of course. Thanks for the Dom.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.558
Yeah.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.717
Can we talk about this later?

30:06.800 --> 30:09.872
She won't wait forever, Jonny.

30:09.960 --> 30:12.554
I feel so sorry for her.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.433
See?

30:18.120 --> 30:19.872
- Thank you.
- Everything alright?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.549
Yeah, everything's fine.
We'll be back out in February.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.871
See if you can figure out the whole
champagne-bottle thing by then.

30:26.960 --> 30:30.509
- Yep, I will practise daily.
- Knock yourself out.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.678
Trying to shake your hand,
punch you in the stomach. Not cool.

30:34.760 --> 30:37.115
So, I'll put the photos on Facebook.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.230
Well,... poke me.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.149
Right. OK, girls.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.596
This is for all your hard work.
Thank you so much.

30:47.680 --> 30:50.558
And, Kim, you know you get
a lift pass too, don't you?

30:50.640 --> 30:55.031
Just charge it to the chalet.
Unless you'd prefer the cash.

30:55.120 --> 30:57.270
- Lift pass would be great.
- OK.

30:57.360 --> 31:00.158
- Alright, let's go.
- It's a private plane. It can wait.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.874
- It will. I won't.
- Desperate to get back to work.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.679
OK, maybe I'll quit,
and next time we can hitchhike here.

31:05.760 --> 31:08.558
A father-son adventure.
I like the sound of that. Bye.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.714
- "Poke me"?
- Piss off.

31:16.840 --> 31:18.319
Slut.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.234
200-euro tip for one week?

31:22.320 --> 31:24.072
Are you sure you're just cooking?

31:24.160 --> 31:27.869
I'll put it in the bank when I can.
You OK?

31:28.640 --> 31:30.392
- Yeah. Solid.
- Huh?

31:30.480 --> 31:32.311
I mean sound, yeah.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.870
- Don't let them work you too hard.
- I won't.

31:47.360 --> 31:50.079
Right, Finland, let's do this.
Where do we start?

31:50.160 --> 31:55.075
Well, in slopestyle, you are scored
on your tricks on the rails,

31:55.160 --> 31:56.798
and the jump you pull at the end.

31:56.880 --> 32:00.555
- You smell me?
- Yes, I smell you. Unfortunately.

32:02.080 --> 32:05.868
Think about the run. Only the run.
Be the board.

32:09.080 --> 32:11.230
Let's get tricky with Mikki!

32:17.520 --> 32:19.556
Right, come on, Kim.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.356
Yes!

32:45.000 --> 32:47.434
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:47.520 --> 32:51.559
You do realise you're riding a beginner
board from, like, the 16th century?

32:51.640 --> 32:55.030
I thought the 16th century
was the golden age of snowboarding.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.873
Go to the rental shop
and pick yourself up a park board.

32:57.960 --> 33:00.030
You'll have more fun on that, trust me.

33:00.120 --> 33:04.113
And ask for Willy. Tell him
Tara sent you. He'll hook you up.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.395
Stay safe out there.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.399
Thanks.

33:20.760 --> 33:21.954
Kann ich dir helfen?

33:23.280 --> 33:25.555
Oh, I'm just looking, thanks.

33:25.640 --> 33:29.679
Rentals are only 80 euros a week,
and half-price for staff.

33:30.360 --> 33:34.433
Well, I'm staff. And actually,
Tara told me to come by.

33:34.520 --> 33:37.239
OK, fine. 30.

33:37.320 --> 33:41.074
Freestyle board, boots and helmet.
You get top end for that.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.991
Cool. Deal.

§  For such a long time

33:59.440 --> 34:02.796

we're hanging on

- Hey!

34:18.679 --> 34:20.511
Check it out! That's your buddy, Kim.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.998
Whoo!

34:23.120 --> 34:25.953
I thought you said she hadn't been
in the mountains before.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.638
She hadn't.

34:27.719 --> 34:28.708
§  Far away with me

34:28.800 --> 34:30.710
§  You will never know

34:30.840 --> 34:33.592
Hey, Kimmy.
I've got my first interview tomorrow.

34:33.679 --> 34:37.958
And, well, I'm being a good boy and
going through the statements, but I saw

34:38.040 --> 34:40.873
that tip money hasn't gone in.
It's probably their fault

34:40.960 --> 34:42.632
but I just thought I'd let you know.

34:42.719 --> 34:47.714
And, hey, Kimmy, aubergines. Whoo!
My new favourite food. Who knew?

34:47.840 --> 34:49.239
Alright, Kimmy, love you.

35:04.560 --> 35:07.074
- Didn't hear you get up.
- I haven't.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.598
Level nine! Yeah, baby.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.595
You really think
you're going to win that pro?

35:43.680 --> 35:45.159
N-N-No.

35:45.240 --> 35:47.151
Hallo!

35:47.240 --> 35:50.118
Abend. Fräulein.

35:50.200 --> 35:53.272
- Hey, Bernie.
- What's with the towel, Bernie?

35:53.440 --> 35:57.399
My name is Bernhardt. Mr Madsen,
he asked me to test the hot tub.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.630
- Did he now?
- Jawohl.

36:00.520 --> 36:04.957
There is, you must know,
room for more than just one.

36:05.080 --> 36:07.640
That is so funny,

36:07.720 --> 36:09.915
because Kim and I were just saying

36:10.000 --> 36:12.594
how much we would love
to share a hot tub with Bernhardt.

36:12.680 --> 36:16.070
- For sure?
- Yeah.

36:16.160 --> 36:19.436
But the problem is,
we don't have our swimsuits.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.511
Who needs swimsuits?

36:22.320 --> 36:24.993
Yeah, Kim, who needs swimsuits?

36:25.120 --> 36:26.712
You are so right.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.519
Maybe when we're out there
you could give me a back rub.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.592
And then we can, like,
frolic naked in the snow!

36:33.440 --> 36:35.237
Yeah.

36:39.800 --> 36:45.079
Ah! I understand.
The famous English humour.

36:45.160 --> 36:46.798
I forget.

36:54.960 --> 36:56.473
Stop snowing!

36:59.520 --> 37:02.990
§  We are not going back

37:04.280 --> 37:05.554
§  Yeah

37:20.560 --> 37:22.437
Yes!

37:28.240 --> 37:30.037
It's your birthday?

37:30.120 --> 37:32.680
What makes you think that?

37:40.760 --> 37:44.070
You want to look at anything else?
Bank statements, knicker drawer?

37:44.160 --> 37:47.232
- Bertie's. Now.
- I'm can't, I'm saving.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.709
I thought you were
just about to win $25,000.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.995
I don't think you need to save.
Come on.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.592
No, Georgie. I'm not going.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.477
Betty in the house!

37:57.600 --> 38:00.239
You owe me ten euros, G.
She bet me you'd never come in.

38:00.320 --> 38:04.518
She says you were too much of a...
How you say? Chav? What is a chav?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.477
Yeah, Georgie, what is a chav?

38:06.560 --> 38:09.438
I didn't... His English is awful.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.590
Buy yourself some vegetables.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.438
Hey, Willy. This is Kim.

38:13.520 --> 38:17.115
We already met. Tara says
you look sweet on the freestyle.

38:17.200 --> 38:19.316
Do you know who that is?

38:19.400 --> 38:21.960
- Yeah. It's Tara.
- Tara Dakides!

38:22.040 --> 38:24.474
She won, like,
1,000 X Games medals.

38:24.560 --> 38:27.632
First chick in the world
to pull a backside rodeo, right, Willy?

38:27.720 --> 38:29.756
Broke her back
in three places learning it.

38:29.840 --> 38:32.149
Now she needs a painkiller
every time she rides.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.437
- Insane. What is she doing here?
- The Roxy. Her big comeback.

38:35.520 --> 38:37.238
She reckons this girl has game.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.432
I taught her everything she knows!

38:41.840 --> 38:43.512
- Alright.
- Yeah.

38:43.600 --> 38:46.239
Happy birthday! Blow out your candles!

38:48.440 --> 38:50.271
Whoo-hoo!

- But it's rule number one.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.910
The night is young, and so are we.

39:53.240 --> 39:55.310
Just a few.

40:02.280 --> 40:04.840

- You are welcome.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.313
Oh, come on!

40:09.080 --> 40:13.790
- Little Finnish lunatic.
- How long have you been together?

40:13.880 --> 40:17.316
- Oh, we're not together.
- My balls are ice cream!

40:23.200 --> 40:26.317
Argh.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.675
Chill out.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.917

You here all season?

41:19.720 --> 41:21.756
- Jimmy's going home.
- Don't tempt me.

41:21.840 --> 41:26.152
There's a broken coffee table in
the hall, the speaker system is kaput,

41:26.240 --> 41:28.674
and vomit on the yucca plant.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.069
Excellent work, girls.

41:31.160 --> 41:35.472
Just as long as nobody painted
a comedy moustache on the...

41:43.360 --> 41:46.397
OK, look, just clean up the mess,
I'll replace the kit,

41:46.520 --> 41:49.080
you pay me back later.
We'll take it out of your tips.

41:49.160 --> 41:51.879
- But what's happened...
- They don't need to know.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.509
I don't understand why they would
do this if they knew we were coming.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.511
- You told them, right?
- Ja, sicher.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.673
Jawohl. I say Mr Jonny come early
because of the good snow.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.637
- No, no, no, he didn't!
- You didn't!

42:03.720 --> 42:05.790
- I did.
- Awesome sauna, bro.

42:08.560 --> 42:12.075
OK, erm... You do not get
to call me needle cock ever again.

42:12.160 --> 42:15.948
And you, next time you have a birthday
party, do it at your own house.

42:16.040 --> 42:18.031
Yeah, yeah, a few rounds of Twister,

42:18.120 --> 42:20.429
a couple of games of gin rummy
and we're away.

42:20.520 --> 42:22.556
- Great.
- Pop round if you're in the area.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.631
- Maybe I will.
- Cool.

42:28.480 --> 42:31.040
Er, breakfast at eight. OK?

42:34.480 --> 42:36.869
Better luck next time, Scheisskopf.

You're really going to have
to win that competition now.

42:48.840 --> 42:51.354
Yep.

Come on, babes.

First day of the season.

43:04.800 --> 43:08.793

We are crazy for it.

44:02.680 --> 44:04.318

44:04.400 --> 44:06.436
The windows steam up
if you do it right.

44:06.520 --> 44:10.479
Yep. On this one you only have
90 seconds. No time for foreplay.

44:10.560 --> 44:12.391
90 seconds is Nige's record.

- Wow.

44:20.640 --> 44:22.870
- The Yeti.
- The who?

44:22.960 --> 44:25.474
Not really a Yeti.
Just some local mystery guy.

44:25.560 --> 44:28.279
He's always first to put fresh tracks
down the powder.

- Local mystery person.

- Of course it fricking hurts, idiot!

46:38.280 --> 46:41.556
OK, give her some more
of that strong stuff. Yeah.

46:43.520 --> 46:45.909

- So you should. It's all your fault.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.433
I'm joking. It's really not.

46:47.520 --> 46:50.876
I'll get her back to London
this afternoon. We know a good surgeon.

46:50.960 --> 46:53.474

50:01.120 --> 50:03.156
You guys ready? Let's go.

50:05.600 --> 50:08.034
Right, come on, buster.

50:08.120 --> 50:10.714
It's been a long day, Betty.
Take it easy.

50:23.960 --> 50:26.349
Hey, watch and learn, my friend!

50:26.440 --> 50:28.271
Betty, wait up! It's too soon!

50:35.080 --> 50:36.433
Whoa!

50:53.560 --> 50:55.915
I think that's enough carrots.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.673
Why give up now
after you've worked so hard?

51:00.760 --> 51:04.753
- Because I don't feel like it, OK?
- It's just a sprain.

51:04.840 --> 51:07.400
This time. Then next time
I break my neck. Then what?

51:07.480 --> 51:09.072
People die doing this stuff.

51:09.160 --> 51:11.037
- I thought you needed the money.
- I do.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.190
Maybe if I hadn't spent it
renting ski kit

51:13.280 --> 51:16.590
and replacing stupid speakers,
which we haven't paid for yet...

51:16.680 --> 51:20.468
Jesus, Kim,
we're meant to be having fun.

51:28.120 --> 51:32.750
Hello, this is Kim Matthews's phone.
Leave a message after the tone. Bye!

51:34.480 --> 51:36.835
Cheer up, babe. It might never happen.

51:36.920 --> 51:40.310
It has. It continues to.

51:40.400 --> 51:43.153
Do you know what you need to do?

51:43.240 --> 51:44.753
Drink bleach? Good idea.

51:44.840 --> 51:47.195
Two capfuls. Bucket. Hot water.

51:47.280 --> 51:51.114
You know what they say, don't you?
Tidy kitchen, tidy mind.

51:56.080 --> 51:58.310
I just feel like I'm losing her.

51:58.400 --> 52:01.517
People change. Change is good.

52:02.600 --> 52:04.556
Where's her mum, then?

52:05.600 --> 52:09.434
Sutton Row Cemetery.
Change isn't always good.

52:15.440 --> 52:16.668
Two capfuls?

52:19.480 --> 52:22.392
Yo-ho, snow-ho!

52:24.040 --> 52:27.237
- How's your arm?
- It's alright. It's getting there.

52:27.320 --> 52:29.311
The doctor said it'll be fine
in a few days.

52:29.400 --> 52:32.437
Oh. Wow, she can talk to me now,
right?

52:32.520 --> 52:35.273
Now that Captain America
isn't calling her 50 times a day.

52:35.360 --> 52:39.069
I need my training buddy. They started
building the course for the pro.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.118
- You wanna take a sneaky peeky?
- No, I can't.

52:42.200 --> 52:44.794
We've got corporate guests.
Big weekend.

52:44.880 --> 52:48.350
One hour? You've got to do this.

52:50.560 --> 52:54.473
Betty, you on a board,
it's where you're meant to be.

52:54.560 --> 52:58.075
You've got so much talent
it's unfair on the rest of us, so why...

53:00.280 --> 53:01.998
Betty...

53:03.960 --> 53:06.349
Sorry, Mikki. I can't.

53:15.600 --> 53:16.794
Bye.

53:21.400 --> 53:23.356
- Thank you, Kate.
- Dad, her name's Kim.

53:23.440 --> 53:27.035
Where's that one from last year, Dickie?
Really big tits, big arse?

53:27.120 --> 53:29.270
Henry Goodwin?
He went bust, didn't you hear?

53:29.360 --> 53:31.828
- You prick! The chalet girl.
- Milly broke her leg.

53:31.920 --> 53:33.990
- What, skiing?
- Après-skiing.

53:34.080 --> 53:37.436
You're too lean for my taste.
We'll have to fatten you up, love.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.353
Yeah, a bit more cushion
for the pushin'.

53:42.440 --> 53:44.396
- They tip well.
- They'd better.

53:44.480 --> 53:46.232
We need Malcolm to come in first.

53:46.320 --> 53:48.914
40 mill, 50 maybe.
The others will follow.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.150
- You worry too much.
- You don't worry enough.

53:51.240 --> 53:54.357
- Dickie, shift your arse!
- Right. Let's get going.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.908
Georgie, you're coming with us
to dish up lunch?

53:57.040 --> 54:00.077
Erm, actually I've come down
with something.

54:00.160 --> 54:04.950
It's like a little tickle.
It's like...

54:05.040 --> 54:07.713
Oh. Well, you'd better come,
then, erm...

54:07.800 --> 54:10.030
- Oh, Dad, for God's sake, it's Kim.
- Kim.

54:10.160 --> 54:12.549
No, I should be...

54:12.640 --> 54:13.993
Ow.

54:15.240 --> 54:19.153
Fine. I'll get changed
and get my lift pass.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.435
You don't need a lift pass.

54:21.520 --> 54:23.795
How can you not need a lift pass?

54:26.760 --> 54:29.115
Ah.

54:29.240 --> 54:30.958
You ever been
in one of these things?

54:31.040 --> 54:33.713
Yeah, we got one at home.
This one's pretty small.

54:33.800 --> 54:36.917
- Do we pay extra for irony?
- No, the irony's free.

54:37.000 --> 54:39.468
It's the sarcasm you're paying for.

54:39.560 --> 54:41.198
Ironically.

54:57.560 --> 54:58.959
Oh, wow.

54:59.040 --> 55:02.476
- How long have you been on that thing?
- About eight weeks.

55:02.640 --> 55:04.551
Jesus. Dickie...

55:04.640 --> 55:07.108
You can fly back on the bird
if you're not sure.

55:07.240 --> 55:10.789
- She's fine. Trust me.
- I don't want her holding us up.

55:25.280 --> 55:29.398
The global financial meltdown
just happened to other people, right?

55:29.480 --> 55:33.234
I warned you about sub-primes. Greed
is only good when it comes to lunch.

55:33.320 --> 55:35.834
Speaking of which, what is this?

55:35.920 --> 55:40.675
Special Austrian food.
Strudel, nudel and... knödel.

55:40.760 --> 55:44.958
I wouldn't mind a "canoodle"
with this one in fact.

55:45.080 --> 55:48.197
Right, nearest the pin, lads.
It's 50s in and it's...

55:48.280 --> 55:50.032
I'm going to go 32C.

55:50.120 --> 55:52.873
It's hard to tell. The jumper
might be bulking her up.

55:52.960 --> 55:54.757
Put me down for a 30B.

55:54.840 --> 55:57.912
Miles off. I'm thinking 30D,
the Holy Grail of bra sizes.

55:58.000 --> 56:00.912
Controversial. Go on, Kimmy,
put us out of our misery.

56:01.000 --> 56:02.797
No, Kim, don't answer that.

56:03.920 --> 56:07.390
I'm sorry. I was under the impression
that we were enjoying ourselves.

56:07.480 --> 56:11.075
Unlike most women you know, Malcolm,
Kim keeps her clothes on for a living.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.275
Oh.

56:12.360 --> 56:14.237
It's alright.
You know what they say.

56:14.320 --> 56:16.390
The bigger the chat,
the smaller the chap.

56:18.920 --> 56:21.388
New game. Waistlines.
Malcolm?

56:24.520 --> 56:26.476
Fantastic weekend, Dickie.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.790
Flattery will get you nowhere

56:28.880 --> 56:33.874
but some fresh powder and a couple of
tasty chalet tarts will get you 40 mill.

56:35.120 --> 56:38.271
- Dad, wait.
- Forgotten your hair-care products?

56:39.480 --> 56:43.109
Actually, I was thinking about staying
a couple more days if it's OK.

56:43.200 --> 56:47.637
Hey, do your thing.
Back for the weekend, obviously?

56:47.720 --> 56:49.551
Yeah, of course.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.918
I'll see you guys soon.

56:54.640 --> 56:58.349
There's, like, 400 euros here.
Should think so too. Bloody perverts.

56:58.440 --> 57:00.590
Jonny didn't ask us
to pay him back for...

57:00.680 --> 57:03.877
Thanks for reminding me.

57:06.760 --> 57:11.151
Oh, and you. Yes.

57:13.120 --> 57:16.954
OK, so that you can earn yours back,
I want to hire you.

57:17.040 --> 57:18.917
50 euros an hour.

57:20.240 --> 57:22.549
Not like that.

57:25.040 --> 57:27.315
- Need a hand? The meter's running.
- No.

57:27.400 --> 57:30.198
That's three euros right there.
Well, it's your money.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.475
Actually, it's mine now. Again.

57:32.600 --> 57:35.592
Show me what's so great
about boarding. Let's get gnarled.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.319
- Gnarly.
- Whatever. Sick, phat, ill.

57:38.400 --> 57:40.038
You sound like a doctor.

57:42.720 --> 57:46.030
- Holy shit, I'm a natural.
- Shut up, snoogles.

57:49.680 --> 57:51.511
Move back into position.

57:51.600 --> 57:54.273
- Watch this one.
- Now concentrate.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.590
- OK.
- Idiot.

57:56.680 --> 58:00.673
I think you mean, "Concentrate, please,
valued paying customer."

58:01.840 --> 58:05.071
- Oops.
- Ow!

58:05.200 --> 58:10.035
- OK, that was an accident.
- I'm not going to be your bit of fun.

58:11.520 --> 58:15.229
- Go on, then.
- Yes, yes, yes.

58:16.440 --> 58:18.749
Come on, loser.
I'll show you how it's done.

58:27.360 --> 58:28.952
Yes!

58:29.040 --> 58:32.077
So you have a pretty rough life, huh?

58:32.160 --> 58:35.072
- Hideous, isn't it?
- I don't know how you stand it.

58:35.200 --> 58:36.838
It's not all it's cracked up to be.

58:36.920 --> 58:39.912
I've heard that having loads of money
can be a real let-down.

58:41.600 --> 58:44.068
You think I could do
anything I want to?

58:45.120 --> 58:49.557
Truth is, my dad's been saving a place
for me on the board since I was two

58:49.640 --> 58:52.234
and my mother won't be happy
until I've married Chloe

58:52.320 --> 58:55.198
and have nine children
with perfect teeth.

58:55.280 --> 58:57.077
They've got it all planned out for me

58:57.160 --> 59:00.038
and I'm, like,
"This is it? This is my life?"

59:02.800 --> 59:05.519
No, nice try, but not quite.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.398
Oh, angst. The rich kid's alternative
to real problems.

59:08.480 --> 59:12.553
Sarcasm. The chalet girl's alternative
to real humour. I know I'm lucky...

59:12.680 --> 59:14.716
"But I'm stuck in this caged existence

59:14.800 --> 59:17.030
of vintage champagne
and luxury ski chalets

59:17.120 --> 59:19.111
when I just want to be a pop star."

59:19.240 --> 59:21.310
Rock star.

59:27.520 --> 59:30.830
- Why don't you just do it, then?
- It's just not that simple.

59:33.400 --> 59:36.198
- What?
- It's nothing.

59:36.280 --> 59:38.714
No, what? Go on.

59:38.840 --> 59:41.115
It's just a bit silly.
My mum always used to say,

59:41.240 --> 59:44.516
"You've got brains in your head,
feet in your shoes."

59:44.600 --> 59:47.512
"You can steer yourself
in any direction you choose."

59:50.520 --> 59:51.839
Clever girl, your mum.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.316
Yeah. We should get going.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:01.879
Yeah.

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.396
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.439
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:12.433
The season ends, he goes back
to his world, you go back to yours.

01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.788
What are you left with?

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:17.714
My world?
Where exactly is that? Pluto?

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:20.917
- No, that's not what I meant.
- Don't judge me by your standards.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.195
You'd rather be with a rich idiot
like Nigel

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.999
instead of Mikki
who you are clearly in love with.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:29.709
- I'm going for a beer.
- There's something you need to know.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.509
I think I'm done
on the friendly advice for now, thanks.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.956
It'd be better
if you just stay out of it, OK?

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:43.711
Do you want to talk about it?
A barman's cheaper than a shrink.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.631
A beer's cheaper than a barman.

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.274
- I'm pretty cheap.
- Beer doesn't talk back either.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.317
Hey. Are you OK?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:19.473
- She told you where I was, then?
- I'm staying out of it.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.071
Look, about us...

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:24.999
Night, Jonny.

01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:30.070
What I really came to say was
I booked the helicopter again.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.070
I need someone to serve me lunch.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.672
You are so annoying.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:51.873
§  I feel sweet

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.315
§  Do you feel sweet?

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.072
§  It's amazing

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:03.719
§  I have no skin,
and I feel everything

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.438
§  It's amazing

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.510
§  I've wanted this for so long

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.955
§  Now the deed has been done

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.838
§  We shall rise with the sun

01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:19.150
§  Spend our time as one

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.834
§  Now there is no sin in anything

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.672
§  It's life-changing

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.234
§  This feeling

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.592
§  This feeling

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:56.791
§  This feeling

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.311
§  It's amazing

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:06.878
§  From now on

01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.069
§  From now on

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.549
§  We are one

01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:14.710
§  It's amazing

01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:17.553
§  It's in the stars, in the sun

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.596
§  It's everywhere, in everyone

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.229
§  And it will be every day

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.720
§  From now on

§  It's amazing

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.031
It's like pass the parcel.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.270
34B. Knew it.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.353
What?

01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:01.678
Nothing.

01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:17.196
Would it freak you out if I said
that was the best day of my life?

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.070
OK, maybe not the best,
but certainly top... five.

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:27.919
What is with you people
walking in on me naked?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.515
I think the idea was
you stayed below stairs, young lady.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:35.673
And you, don't you have
an engagement party to go to?

01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:39.235
For a second there
I thought she meant...

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.877
Oh.

01:04:57.560 --> 01:04:59.710
- I did try to tell you.
- It's not hard.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.836
"Did you hear
Jonny proposed to Chloe?"

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.951
"No. Thanks for letting me know, chum."

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:05.758
I didn't want to see you get hurt.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.992
Yeah, you just did a spiffing job
all round, didn't you?

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:13.834
She's a chalet girl.
My God, it is such a cliché.

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:16.354
I wouldn't have minded so much
if you were discreet

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:19.910
but Bernhardt said you were all over
each other, on the beginner slope!

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.310
Bernhardt could learn a few things
about being discreet himself.

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:25.868
Honey, do you realise
what you're risking here?

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.951
You have to stop this right now,
or I will.

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.510
This isn't Jane Austen, Mum.
Look, when you and Dad met...

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.591
Enough, Jonathan.

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.157
I just think you can do better.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.595
Well, I don't think
Dad could have done better.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.872
Look, your father and l, we got lucky.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.952
But believe me,
this girl is only after one thing.

01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:48.951
Yeah. And it was great.

01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:52.350
- Is there a reason you're still here?
- Look, Kim, can we just...

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:57.070
There's a noise. I can't quite...
Oh, that's right, it's a lying bastard.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.515
Yeah. OK.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:03.878
Erm, well, look, I owe you...
three hours.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.629
Shit.

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:13.030
Kim! Kim, wait! Kim!

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:17.358
Kim!

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.557
About 8:30 tomorrow.
I'll cook you a nice tea to celebrate.

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:37.234
- What about the competition?
- I was never going to win.

01:06:37.320 --> 01:06:39.390
It's fine. I can come back
and sort you out.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:42.438
I've lasted three months.
I'm sure I can manage another week.

01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:45.512
Dad, I looked online
at your latest order. 24 tins of beans?

01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.391
Are you giving up
the chance of a lifetime

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.436
because I'm eating
too many baked beans?

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.511
Someone's got to take care of you.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.717
Oh, no, you don't.
Don't you dare do that, Kimmy.

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:59.394
Don't you put this on me.
This is your decision.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:03.109
Anyway, since when did my Kimmy
ever say there was no way

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:04.952
she was gonna win something?

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.031
I'll tell you something else, Kimberley.

01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.994
What, William?

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.195
It's what she would have wanted.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:18.035
Hallo. Was bekommst du?

01:07:19.080 --> 01:07:20.752
Erm, what do you want?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:34.112
It's a beautiful spring morning
here in St Anton,

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.794
perfect conditions
for the open qualifiers!

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:39.989
Come on! Come on!

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.833
..ranks with a kicker.

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.596
Mixing things up

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:52.875
and finishing off
with a super styley 540

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:56.157
that should see him through
to the weekend's final.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:00.597
And there it is, a 73!.
That sends Hampton through.

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.356
Next up, from Finland, Mikki Niemenan!

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.637
- That's you, champ.
- Is Georgie out there?

01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.315
Well, don't think about her.
Think about the run. Only the run.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.470
Be the board.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:19.872
Go!

01:08:20.399 --> 01:08:23.631
Here he goes,
the Finnish freak now going down,

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.915
hammers those rails!

01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:30.069
Niemenan
showing some impressive skills.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:34.432
Switch 50-50, backside 180.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.394
Sweet! Coming up to the booter
where he fell last year.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:40.755
Hits it, going for broke!

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.590
Whoa!

01:08:45.840 --> 01:08:47.353
And broke it is!

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:51.479
He's up, but he's going to have
a monster headache in the morning.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:54.356
- You sure you want this?
- Just do it.

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:57.432
And in the ladies' qualifiers now...

01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:59.475
Don't worry, it's legal.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.511
- Better than sex too.
-.. Tara Dakides!

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:10.071
A solid 50-50 on the goalpost. Boom!

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:14.518
She spread some butter on the box!

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:18.756
And a frontside seven lean!

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.470
A master class from the master!

01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.835
The Greek goddess!

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:28.707
Whatever, man! She is awesome!

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:31.394
The Queen of Scream is back!

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:34.198
- Ow!
- Now, last up, strapped in,

01:09:34.279 --> 01:09:37.908
trying to follow an amazing run,
newcomer Kim Matthews.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.591
Let's see what she has got!

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.149
Drei, zwei, eins. Go!

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.751
A front 180 to switch tail, a 180 out!

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.515
Textbook awesomeness!

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:54.433
A silky tail press. Nice one, Matthews!

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.311
Throwing an indy grab
coming off the box!

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:05.150
And here she goes now,
coming up to the big booter!

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:12.959
What's happened there?

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.992
She's stopped short
and takes the lame line down.

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:20.798
Kim might have done just enough on the
top section to get into the main event.

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.237
Oh, no. 59, just outside qualification.

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.470
Kim will be back on finals day,

01:10:27.560 --> 01:10:29.949
but she'll have to wait and see
if she gets a ride.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.600
I came 21st. Yay!

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:34.716
That's great. How many qualify?

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:38.634
The top 20. So, suddenly, not so yay.
I am first reserve though.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.395
- I get a chance if someone pulls out.
- You gave it your best shot though.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:47.671
- Dad, I've got to go.
- OK, bye.

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.318
Bye.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.829
Finland!

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.911
Morphine rules!

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.639
It's just ligaments, thank God.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:03.920
Oh, piss off! Again.

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:18.713
Hi.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.748
So you are the Yeti.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:28.399
Must be the hair.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.552
Want to talk about it?

01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.235
No.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.551
It's just something that...

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.471
Er...

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:28.312
We were...

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.960
We were driving home, and, erm...

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.598
I'd just won the London Trials

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.353
and... all of us in the car,

01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.839
me and my mum and dad,

01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:39.115
were singing at the top of our voices

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.431
and we were all laughing
cos none of us can sing for shit.

01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:44.476
And, erm...

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.717
Er...

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:50.189
My dad had to swerve, and...

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:54.190
And he skidded off the road.

01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.919
And my...

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.319
My mum was on the side
that got hit, and...

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:10.310
And she died.

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.196
My mum died.

01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:20.311
I just really miss her.

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.197
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.440
I always get like this
when I'm around Yetis.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:46.392
Let's ride.

01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:54.314
I always tell the mountains
my problems. They're good listeners.

01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:43.236
Two minutes. I'm going to go
and tell the caterers.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.879
Jonathan!

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:53.190
Deidre and I would like to say...

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:55.794
Lord and Lady Marberry,
can I get you another drink?

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.872
Well, why not? Good to see you.

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.117
If you've got to do it, do it now.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:12.188
He had it the entire time we were there
and I had no idea. Such a surprise.

01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.033
- Excuse me. Can I have a word?
- Yeah.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:16.917
Thanks.

01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.638
What's up?

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.033
What?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.996
- What is it?
- Erm...

01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.913
I have an idea
that I wanted to run by you.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:35.838
How-How would you feel
if we didn't get married?

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:37.871
How would that sit with you?

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:46.073
- Good idea.
- Really? You're OK with this?

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.396
Of course I'm not OK with it.

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.992
- Look, I understand it's bad timing.
- Do you really?

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.914
Ending a five-year relationship
in the middle of our engagement party?

01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.037
Yes, I think that constitutes
bad timing!

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.794
- I'm sorry, I'm...
- An asshole is what you are!

01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.555
Exactly right. I am.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.315
You're in love with her, aren't you?

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:25.717
Exactly right. I am.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.234
Someday I will probably
thank you for this,

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.835
for not going through with it
just to please your mother.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.831
But today...

01:17:53.440 --> 01:17:56.637
Today, it's not quite how I'm feeling.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.237
Here, I got you some ice
for the swelling.

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.556
They're gonna blow up.

01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.236
Come on, let's go.

01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.235
- And for your next trick...
- You're not upset?

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.629
She's lovely, but I trust you.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:20.598
Your mother, on the other hand...

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:26.396
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the happy couple.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:28.750
In the unlikely event
of an emergency landing,

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.991
the cabin crew will direct you
to the nearest available exit.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:33.997
It was like love at first sight.

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:37.436
They were kids,
if you can believe that.

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.150
OK, baby. Let's get you drunk.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:47.309
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.719
Yeah, laters, babe. Yeah.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.360
Oh, my God!
You guys are never going to believe

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.032
what happened to Jonny and Chloe.

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:56.954
Apparently there was this major
showdown at their engagement party.

01:18:57.040 --> 01:18:59.600
Hattie says Chloe dumped Jonny
in front of everyone

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.352
and Jonny stormed out.

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.432
But Pips also tweeted that it was
Jonny who broke up with Chloe

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.795
and Chloe just passed out, right there.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.713
Either way,
it was just super-dramatic, right?

01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.712
What?

01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:19.791
I couldn't care less.

01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:28.879
Welcome to Channel 419, broadcasting
live from St Anton, Austria.

01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:31.474
Let's go to our girl on the scene,
Jasmine Kendal.

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:34.916
So it's finals day here in St Anton,
and one shot is all they get.

01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.956
Come on, y'all. Let's make some noise!

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.789
The Roxy Slopestyle Pro! Whoo!

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.476
Come on, let this be the best event in
the history of snowboarding! Let's go!

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:48.676
Whoo!

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:51.320
Good luck, Kim.
I hope you get a ride.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:54.392
Yeah, well, fingers crossed.

01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:56.272
Thanks, Günter.

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.556
Whoa, whoa, this area is reserved.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.676
- Well, I'm the reserve.
- Oh, yes?

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.274
- Your tick here?
- Does it really matter?

01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.796
- You're not listening.
- Enough. I'm doing it already.

01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:12.518
Thanks.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:16.115
20th qualifier, Anja Schmidt!

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.919
By my count, nice. That's an 84!.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.798
Bethany Loux, getting high!
She's looking good!

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:26.917
Uh-oh, that bump's gonna cost her.

01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:31.471
Halfway through the competition now,
and this thing is still wide open.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:34.313
What's this? A front flip! Yes!

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:37.073
Awesome-tacular!

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:44.233
Some major amplitude on that hit! Sick!

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.630
Deep in the final stages.
It is getting tense!

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:53.038
Oh. And a super-smooth 720.

01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:56.157
That takes Kjersti Buaas
into top spot!

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.240
Final three competitors
to the gate, please.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.348
Howson, Beal and... Dakides.

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.910
You see, you must have a system
or else everything fails.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.719
Now, my friend, my work here is done.

01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.795
- Hey.
- Just wanted to say good luck.

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:18.359
Thanks.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:22.155
Hey, you killed it in qualifying,
you know that?

01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.074
- Up to the point where I screwed up.
- Yeah. Up until then.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.991
OK, Tara, it's ready.

01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.756
- Well, I'll leave you to it.
- Thanks.

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.828
Pretty near perfect yesterday, babe.
What's left to prove?

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:53.798
Hey, Kim. Come back.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.758
- You're riding.
- But no one's dropped out.

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:14.270
Try not to screw up this time, huh?

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:19.309
Hey, clipboard guy. I'm pulling out.
I gave my bib to Kim.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:29.030
- Last up, lead qualifier...
- Hold on.

01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:34.797
Wait... I'm being told that
Tara Dakides has had to pull out.

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:38.919
Her place is being taken
by Kim Matthews from the UK.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.952
- Hello?
- Channel 419.

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:54.190
I'm on. Now.

01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:04.712
Ready?

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:13.756
§  Oh, take these storms away,
start a brand-new story

01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:17.230
§  I'll make it through each day,
singing death or glory

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.271

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:22.352
- §  I won't let it bring me down
- Zwei, eins...

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:23.509
Go!

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.875
What channel? Now?

01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.712
Cheers, Bill. Les!

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.709
Kim's coming up to the table.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.275
- Come on.
- §  Hold on

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.312
§  Hold on

01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:48.910
On the goalpost,
backside boardslide. Nice!

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:55.829
Yes!

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:59.071
Now what has she saved up for last?

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.317
§  Hold on, hold on

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.676
§  Where we belong

01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:25.515
§  My heart, my song

01:24:31.560 --> 01:24:32.834
§  Where we belong

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.718
Switch rodeo 900!.

01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:38.155
She is so sweet, my teeth hurt!

01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:41.829
Yes!

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.750
Hey, whoa! Let's stay professional!

01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:54.718
I'm her agent. All offers to me!

01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.636
Ow. Ooh. Ow.

01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:00.631
You were amazing, Betty.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:03.276
Pull your chequebooks and follow me.

01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:06.033
She's my friend!
I saw her first!

01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:12.952
Congratulations.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:16.919
So I guess your hourly rate
just shot through the roof.

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.629
Oh, right. It's the lying bastard.

01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:25.635
- Technically, I never lied to you.
- Withholding-the-truth bastard.

01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.595
You hurt me, you know.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:34.074
Look...

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.352
I'm sorry. I really am.
You know it's over...

01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:42.955
Things are gonna have to change
now I'm a global snowboarding megastar.

01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:49.272
You're right. You're completely
out of my league.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:50.952
Hm-hmm.

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:55.079
It would be really awkward
if I was always paying for everything.

01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.196
I could be a kept man.

01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.512
Come here!

01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:06.228
I've never kissed a girl
in a helmet before.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.952
Safety first.

01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:18.079
Oh, God.

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:20.515
We don't have a licence for that stuff!

01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.069
Alright.

01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.071
Kim, come up here and get your prize!

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.712
That was so beautiful.

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.549
Georgie, from the moment
I laid eyes on you,

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.796
I knew that one day
we would be together

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.110
and now seeing you here l...

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.030
Shitballs.

01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:56.272
How about you?
Want to catch a gondola?

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.157
- OK.
- Really?

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:05.236
And in first place, winning $25,000,

01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:09.717
please welcome to the podium
Kim Matthews!

01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:25.356
What a future
this girl has ahead of her! Amazing!

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.434
§  You say everything's alright

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.229
§  I say nothing can go right, yeah

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:01.117
§  Oh, what a game you can play

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.680
§  Sad days add to confusion

01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.469
§  Sad ways end in delusion, yeah

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:11.152
§  That's the name of the game

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.148
§  Well, I know your love is rough

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.913
§  And the road you take is tough

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:20.116
§  But I just can't get enough

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.673
§  Chequered love

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:25.469
- Erm...
- I'm trying a bit of the old gourmet.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.154
Oh, yeah? Who's the lucky lady?

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.468
You are?

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.672
I mean, only if you want to.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.318
I mean, I only said that

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.231
cos I thought it sounded cool.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:41.472
- I finish work at six.
- Six is good.

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.028
See you at six, then.

01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:48.035
§  Well, I know your love is rough

01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:50.634

01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:54.791
§  Chequered love

01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:57.070
Kim, this is big.

01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:01.034
You know, pro snowboarder,
sponsorship deals all over the place.

01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:03.793
And you totally rocked up
with some hot guy.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.839
- So that's brilliant.
- He just keeps following me around.

01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.310
If you want me to take him off your
hands, that is something I could do.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.153
Yeah. We could sort of share him.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:16.869
§  Chequered love

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:24.280

§  I say nothing can go right, yeah

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.359
§  Oh, what a game you can play

01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.193
Oh! Nigel!

01:29:32.280 --> 01:29:34.748
Jules, we did it!
It's under 90 seconds!

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.273
Well done, babes.

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:40.319
§  Oh, I can't let go

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:42.032
§  Cos I need you so tonight

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:02.795
Whoo-hoo!

- This is your fault.
- You are welcome.

01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.549
