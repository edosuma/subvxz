08:57.837 --> 08:58.871
SHE'S OUR FRIEND.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.873

11:15.674 --> 11:16.976
AN EYE PATCH THAT YEAR?

11:17.043 --> 11:17.410
&gt;&gt; IT WASN'T

11:17.476 --> 11:20.079
BECAUSE SHE LOVED PIRATES.

11:20.146 --> 11:20.980
&gt;&gt; FINE, I DON'T HAVE TO PLAY

11:21.047 --> 11:22.882

14:22.861 --> 14:23.896
THAT I DELIVERED A PIECE OF MAIL

14:23.963 --> 14:25.331

17:02.287 --> 17:02.855
KISSER'S ROCK

17:02.921 --> 17:04.189
ISN'T EVEN A REAL PLACE.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.457

21:22.981 --> 21:23.649
&gt;&gt; WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

21:23.715 --> 21:24.149
I WAITED OUTSIDE

21:24.216 --> 21:24.850
THE STUPID MOVIE THEATRE

21:24.916 --> 21:25.384
FOR AN HOUR

21:25.450 --> 21:26.718
AND YOU NEVER SHOWED UP.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.020
&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

21:28.086 --> 21:29.054
WE WENT TO THE MOVIE TOGETHER,

21:29.121 --> 21:29.921
MET JOHN CENA,

21:29.988 --> 21:30.756
WATCHED HIM BLOW UP

21:30.822 --> 21:32.057
A TRUCK OF MUMMIES AND THEN

21:32.124 --> 21:33.225
WENT TO A CELEBRITY HOCKEY CLUB

21:33.291 --> 21:33.859
WHERE HE ASKED

21:33.925 --> 21:37.763
IF WE WANTED TO BE MOVIE STARS.

21:37.829 --> 21:39.898
&gt;&gt; OH.

21:39.965 --> 21:43.368
CATCH YOU LATER.

21:43.435 --> 21:43.902
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T BELIEVE

21:43.969 --> 21:44.569
THE BEST NIGHT OF MY LIFE

21:44.636 --> 21:47.606
WAS JUST A DREAM.

21:47.673 --> 21:49.007
&gt;&gt; HEY, RYAN.

21:49.074 --> 21:50.542
&gt;&gt; HEY, YOU LIKED THE MOVIE?

21:50.609 --> 21:51.243
&gt;&gt; I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE

21:51.309 --> 21:52.077
TALKING ABOUT IT.

21:52.144 --> 21:52.878
&gt;&gt; SLEPT THROUGH IT, HUH?

21:52.944 --> 21:53.478
&gt;&gt; YEP.

21:53.545 --> 21:54.646

21:54.713 --> 21:55.113
&gt;&gt; GREAT.

21:55.180 --> 21:56.148
AND WE PLAYED LLAMA-LLAMA LAND.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.315
&gt;&gt; OH, YOU'RE THE BEST.

21:57.382 --> 21:58.483
YOU ARE UNBEATABLE AT THAT GAME.

21:58.550 --> 21:59.151
&gt;&gt; SHE KNOWS.

21:59.217 --> 21:59.685
&gt;&gt; REALLY?

21:59.751 --> 22:01.453
&gt;&gt; YES, AND I'M FINE.

22:01.520 --> 22:01.887
FROM NOW ON,

22:01.953 --> 22:02.487
NO ONE HAS TO LET ME

22:02.554 --> 22:03.255
WIN ANYMORE.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.056
IF I'M GONNA WIN,

22:04.122 --> 22:05.490
I'LL DO IT ON MY OWN.

22:05.557 --> 22:06.658
&gt;&gt; YA, LIKE THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

22:06.725 --> 22:07.359
&gt;&gt; WATCH IT.

22:07.426 --> 22:09.828
&gt;&gt; I'M KIDDING, YOU'RE THE BEST.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.196
&gt;&gt; TRUE, HAVE YOU SEEN KOPELMAN?

22:11.263 --> 22:11.797
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO PUT

22:11.863 --> 22:12.731
HIS REPORT ON MAX'S DESK

22:12.798 --> 22:13.732
THIS MORNING.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.399
&gt;&gt; NO, I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

22:14.466 --> 22:15.167
AT ALL.

22:15.233 --> 22:16.134
&gt;&gt; WELL, THAT'S ODD.

22:16.201 --> 22:18.070
I WONDER WHERE HE IS?

22:18.136 --> 22:22.040
[PHONE BEEPS]
