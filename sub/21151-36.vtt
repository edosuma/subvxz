"BIG BROTHER," JALEX WAS MIND
SIDED IN THE DOUBLE EVICTION.

01:07.235 --> 01:14.642
>> UNFORTUNATELY, AT THIS TIME I
HAVE TO VOTE TO EVICT JASON.

01:14.675 --> 01:17.345
>> Announcer: BUT ALEC STILL
CONTINUED TO TRUST PAUL.

01:17.378 --> 01:20.948
>> I'M PRETTY SURE THAT RAVEN
AND JOSH VOTED JASON OUT.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.583
I STILL TRUST PAUL RIGHT NOW.

01:22.616 --> 01:25.153
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO AT THIS

HOUSE.

01:32.793 --> 01:38.532
>> Announcer: EMOTIONS WERE
HIGH FOR THE FINAL FIVE.

01:38.566 --> 01:45.606
BUT WHEN PAUL REVEALED HIS TEARS
WERE ALL FOR SHOW, JOSH WAS LEFT

01:45.639 --> 01:46.674
QUESTIONING HIS FRIENDSHIP.

01:46.707 --> 01:50.711
>> THIS KID GOES FROM CRYING
WHERE I'M THINKING HE'S

01:50.744 --> 01:55.283
EMOTIONAL TO INSTANTLY SMILING.

01:55.316 --> 01:57.285
I FELL LIKE I JUST SAW THE DEVIL
OR SOMETHING.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.419
>> WHAT?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.988

HOUSEHOLD.

02:21.309 --> 02:23.977
>> Announcer: THE MEATBALL
CONTEMPLATED A BIG MOVE.

02:24.011 --> 02:30.518
>> I LOVE PAUL, BUT I GOT TO
SEPARATE PERSONAL, AND I GOT TO

02:30.551 --> 02:31.652
PLAY THE GAME.

02:31.685 --> 02:35.088
>> Announcer: BUT ULTIMATELY
DECIDED TO KEEP HIS ALLIANCE

02:35.122 --> 02:36.056
SAFE.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.626
>> I AM NOT INDICATED YOU KEVIN
AND YOU ALEX.

02:38.659 --> 02:42.363
I NOMINATED ALEX AND KEVIN THIS
WEEK, BUT I HAVE A LOT TO THINK

02:42.396 --> 02:43.564
ABOUT.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.466
LISTEN, PAUL, YOU NEED TO BE
VERY CAREFUL, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT

02:45.499 --> 02:49.002
BE SITTING ON THE BLOCK SOONER
THAN YOU THINK.

02:49.036 --> 02:52.373
>> Announcer: TONIGHT WILL THE
POWER OF VETO SAVE KEVIN OR

02:52.406 --> 02:53.441

02:53.474 --> 02:56.577
PLUS SOMEONE IS GOING HOME,
BECAUSE IT'S A SURPRISE

02:56.610 --> 02:57.578
EVICTION, BABY.

02:57.611 --> 03:00.814
AND THE NEW HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD

03:00.848 --> 03:04.918
ALL THIS RIGHT NOW ON "BIG

03:18.065 --> 03:19.733
>> Julie: GOOD EVENING.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.701
I'M JULIE CHEN.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.002
WELCOME TO "BIG BROTHER."

03:22.035 --> 03:26.139
JUST MOMENTS AGO THE HOUSEGUESTS
LEARNED ABOUT TONIGHT'S SURPRISE

03:26.173 --> 03:27.408
EVICTION.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.011
THAT MEANS ONE OF THE FINAL FIVE
WILL SOON BE EVICTED AND BECOME

03:31.044 --> 03:35.483
JURY NUMBER SEVEN, LEAVING THE
OTHERS IN PLACE AS THE FINAL

03:35.516 --> 03:36.717
FOUR.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.020
THESE FOUR WILL BATTLE AGAINST
EACH OTHER TONIGHT IN A CRITICAL

03:40.053 --> 03:41.322
HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD COMPETITION.

03:41.355 --> 03:45.326
THE WINNER WILL PUNCH THEIR
TICKET TO FINALE NIGHT AND BE

03:45.359 --> 03:50.531
ELIGIBLE TO COMPETE IN THE FINAL
AND MOST IMPORTANT H.O.H.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.666
COMPETITION OF THE SUMMER.

03:52.700 --> 03:56.437
SO WHO WILL SURVIVE THE NIGHT
AND WHO WILL GUARANTEE THEIR

03:56.470 --> 03:58.238
SPOT IN THE FINAL THREE?

03:58.272 --> 04:00.774
WE'LL FIND OUT BEFORE THE HOUR
IS UP.

04:00.808 --> 04:06.714
BUT FIRST, ALEX IS ON THE BLOCK
ON HER OWN AND COMPLETELY IN THE

04:06.747 --> 04:08.115
DARK.

04:08.148 --> 04:12.553
>> THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS
ADJOURNED.

04:12.586 --> 04:16.957
>> I NOMINATED ALEX AND KEVIN
THIS WEEK, BUT I'M ALSO THINKING

04:16.990 --> 04:21.862
OF MAKING A HUGE MOVE AND BACK
DOORING PAUL.

04:21.895 --> 04:26.667
IF I GET TO FINAL TWO WITH HIM,
I WON'T VETO HIM, AND I DON'T

04:26.700 --> 04:27.868
KNOW IF I GET THE FINAL SHOT.

04:27.901 --> 04:33.006
>> I THINK IF ALEX DOESN'T WIN
THE POV, I WILL BE GOING HOME,

04:33.040 --> 04:36.243
WHEN I WIN H.O.H. AND I PUT JOSH
UP TWICE.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.913
>> JOSH NOMINATES ALEX AND KEVIN
AND I COULD NOT BE HAPPIER

04:39.947 --> 04:43.116
BECAUSE WE NEED TO GET ALEX OUT
THIS WEEK, SO I WOULD HAVE DONE

04:43.150 --> 04:48.288
THE SAME EXACT THING, ONLY I
DON'T HAVE TO GET BLOOD ON MY

04:48.322 --> 05:02.870
HANDS THIS WAY.

05:02.903 --> 05:07.107
>> I HAVEN'T FELT THIS BETRAYED
IN A WHILE.

05:07.140 --> 05:11.211
I KNOW MY SPOT IN THE GAME IS
JEOPARDIZED, AND THE ONLY THING

05:11.244 --> 05:18.218
I CAN DO AT THIS POINT IS FAKE
IT.

05:18.251 --> 05:22.923
IT'S TIME THE PLAY DIRTY.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.392
I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO YOU.

05:24.425 --> 05:32.332
I KNOW IT'S A GAME, BUT LIKE
YOU'RE MY FRIEND, DUDE.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.568
>> PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

05:34.602 --> 05:39.139
PLEASE DON'T SAY THAT.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.842
YOU HAVE PERFORMED EVERY SINGLE
TIME.

05:41.875 --> 05:46.079
>> JOSH I'LL PLAY IN THE VETO...

05:46.113 --> 05:48.982
>> LISTEN TO ME.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.952
I'M PLAYING THE VETO, TOO.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.456
WE'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION WHEN
YOU'RE READY, OKAY?

05:55.489 --> 05:57.224
WE HAVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.059
DO YOU TRUST ME?

05:59.092 --> 06:01.094
>> I DID.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.732
>> LISTEN, ALEX, I'M TRYING THE
SHAKE YOU UP AND HELP YOU HERE.

06:04.765 --> 06:09.870
I CAN'T TELL YOU, HEY, I'M
TARGETING SOMEBODY ELSE ALSO

06:09.903 --> 06:11.405
WITHOUT EXPOSING MY GAME.

06:11.439 --> 06:15.308
YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAY
IN THE VETO -- WIN.

06:15.342 --> 06:16.810
HOW DO YOU NOT GET IT?

06:16.844 --> 06:21.381
>> I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT, OKAY?

06:21.415 --> 06:32.225
LOVE YOU, ALEX.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.043
>> I FEEL LIKE AN AWFUL PERSON.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.546
>> JOSH, COME ON, BUDDY.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.617
>> I GOT RID OF JASON AND SHE
TRUSTED ME.

06:56.650 --> 06:59.019
>> SHE'S A GAME PLAYER, FOOL.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.320
YOU'RE BEING DUPED.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.789
STOP IT.

07:01.822 --> 07:05.358
>> SHE'S GOING TO WEAKEN YOU FOR
TOMORROW SO SHE CAN WIN THAT

07:05.392 --> 07:06.426
VETO AND RETALIATE.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.995
I KNOW THIS GIRL.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.597
WE'RE VERY SIMILAR
PERSONALITIES.

07:09.630 --> 07:14.434
YOU DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD
HIDE UNDER A ROCK AND STRUCK THE

07:14.468 --> 07:18.839
OUT OF YOU IF YOU
CROSSED ME?

07:18.872 --> 07:24.111
WE'RE A FAMILY.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.515
>> YOU'RE SCARING ME.

07:27.548 --> 07:40.694
OKAY.

07:44.297 --> 07:52.573
>> I ALREADY TOLL YOU I CAN CRY
ON COMMAND.

07:52.606 --> 07:57.110
I'M CRYING AND MAKING HIM FEEL
BAD.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.478
HE WANTS TO TALK TO ME.

07:58.512 --> 08:01.882
I THINK HE WANTS TO WIN VETO AND
TRY THE PULL ME OFF, BUT THEN

08:01.915 --> 08:03.551
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

08:03.584 --> 08:07.655
IF HE PULLS ME OFF, I THINK HE
WILL BACK DOOR YOU.

08:07.688 --> 08:09.790
>> ALEX, YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
ME?

08:09.823 --> 08:14.995
YOU GOT TO WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF,
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE TARGET.

08:15.028 --> 08:21.835
>> WE ARE IN DANGER RIGHT NOW.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.404
>> WILL YOU PROMISE ME
SOMETHING?

08:24.437 --> 08:30.043
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO
PROMISE?

08:30.077 --> 08:33.480
>> I'M GOING TO BE HONEST, I
HAVE NOT MADE THAT DECISION.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.117
YOU HAVE A VERY SOCIAL GAME.

08:37.150 --> 08:40.721
YOU HAVE BEEN AN AMAZING GAME
PLAYER AND YOU HAVE GROWN AND I

08:40.754 --> 08:41.955
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

08:41.989 --> 08:46.093
I DON'T WANT THAT DECISION.

08:46.126 --> 08:51.231
I TO BELIEVE THAT IF ME AND JOSH
GO TO FINAL TWO,LY PROBABLY WIN

08:51.264 --> 08:57.537
OVER JOSH, BUT IT REALLY
DISTURBS ME THAT I MIGHT CHOOSE

08:57.571 --> 08:58.639
BETWEEN MY TWO GUYS.

08:58.672 --> 09:00.908
THEY HAVE BOTH BEEN MY RIDE-OR
DIE.

09:00.941 --> 09:08.081
I'M NOT READY TO GO THERE YET.

09:08.115 --> 09:11.451
>> HONESTLY I'M JUST
HEARTBROKEN, BECAUSE THE WHOLE

09:11.484 --> 09:14.688
TIME I'M LIKE I'M GOING TO GO TO
FINAL TWO WITH HER, AND SHE

09:14.722 --> 09:15.889
CAN'T GIVE ME THAT BACK IN
RETURN.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.458
I FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT CHEATED
BY MY GIRLFRIEND.

09:18.491 --> 09:20.360
I FEEL LIKE I JUST GOT PLAYED.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.563
AT THIS POINT I DON'T KNOW WHO
DO I TRUST.

09:23.597 --> 09:27.868
>> I DON'T CARE.

09:27.901 --> 09:34.007
>> NO.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.690
>> WHAT?

09:49.723 --> 09:53.193
>> SHE JUST SAID THE ME, DID I
EVER TELL YOU I CAN CRY ON

09:53.226 --> 09:55.729
COMMAND?

09:55.763 --> 10:03.637
>> NO SHE DIDN'T?

10:03.671 --> 10:08.408
>> SHE SAID, I'M GOING TO CRY
AND MAKE JOSH FEEL BAD.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.343
SHE PLAYED YOU.

10:10.377 --> 10:13.146
>> WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.682
>> I'M NOT A ROBOT.

10:14.715 --> 10:17.918
I DON'T NEED YOU GUYS TO COME
AND THIS ALL THIS BRAIN WASHING

10:17.951 --> 10:19.152
THAT YOU WANT TO DO.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.222
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I NEED TO GET
IN GAME MODE AND GUN FOR THAT

10:22.255 --> 10:27.895
VETO.

10:27.928 --> 10:31.799
>> Julie: COMING UP, IT'S THE
POWER OF VETO COMPETITION.

10:31.832 --> 10:35.002
KEVIN AND ALEC'S "BIG BROTHER"
LIVES ARE ON THE LINE.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.705
CAN THEY SAVE THEMSELVES FROM
THE CHOPPING BLOCK?

10:37.738 --> 10:39.506
FIND OUT NEXT.

10:39.539 --> 10:44.644
THEN ANOTHER "HOUSE'S" DREAM OF
WINNING IT ALL COMES TO AN END.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.680
STAY WITH US.

11:00.593 --> 11:01.929
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

11:01.962 --> 11:06.199
IT'S BB COMICS WEEK, BUT THIS
VETO COMPETITION IS NO LAUGHING

11:06.233 --> 11:07.467
MATTER.

11:07.500 --> 11:20.613
EVERYONE HAS A DIFFERENT AGENDA,
AND EVERYONE IS GUNNING TO WIN.

11:20.647 --> 11:24.517
>> BB COMICS IS ABOUT THE
RELEASE 16 NEW SUPERHERO, BUT

11:24.551 --> 11:27.855
THE WORLD CAN'T WAIT, SO IT'S
YOUR JOB AS A BB SUPERFAN TO GET

11:27.888 --> 11:30.057
THE SCOOP ON WHO THEY ARE.

11:30.090 --> 11:32.425
BECAUSE CHRISTMAS WAS NOT
MEDICALLY CLEARED, ONLY FOUR OF

11:32.459 --> 11:33.927
YOU WILL BE COMPETING.

11:33.961 --> 11:37.630
HERE'S HOW THE GAME WORKS: HIT
THE BUTTON TO START YOUR CLOCK.

11:37.664 --> 11:42.002
THEN FLY DOWN THE ZIP LINE TO
PEEK INSIDE THE BB COMICS

11:42.035 --> 11:43.236
STUDIO.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.538
GRAB THE MATCHING COMIC BOOKS
FROM YOUR BIN AND PLACE THEM ON

11:45.572 --> 11:48.809
YOUR COMPUTER SO IT EXACTLY
MATCHES THE BB COMICS STUDIO

11:48.842 --> 11:49.676
WALL.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.444
BUT BEWARE, THERE ARE DECOY
COMICS.

11:51.478 --> 11:55.648
WHEN YOU THINK YOU HAVE ALL 16
CORRECT, HIT YOUR BUTTON.

11:55.682 --> 12:00.520
IF INCORRECT, A BUZZER WILL
SOUND, YOUR CLOCK WILL KEEP RUB

12:00.553 --> 12:02.589
RUNNING, AND YOU MUST FIGURE OUT
WHAT IS WRONG.

12:02.622 --> 12:06.393
IF YOU FAIL TO MATCH THE COMIC
BOOK COLLECTION PERFECTLY WITHIN

12:06.426 --> 12:08.061
45 MINUTES, YOUR TURN WILL BE
OVER.

12:08.095 --> 12:11.031
THE PLAYER WHO MATCHES THE COMIC
STUDIO WALL IN THE SHORTEST

12:11.064 --> 12:14.134
AMOUNT OF TIME WILL WIN THE
POWER OF VETO.

12:14.167 --> 12:22.142
ARE YOU READY TO PLAY BB COMICS?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.011
THIS VETO IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
FOR MY GAME.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.947
IF I WIN AND KEEP THE
NOMINATIONS THE SAME, I GET TO

12:26.980 --> 12:30.683
GET OWL ALEX, ONE OF THE BIGGEST
ME OR THES IN THIS GAME, AND I

12:30.717 --> 12:36.623
GET THE SET MYSELF UP FOR A
RELATIVELY EASIER END GAME.

12:36.656 --> 12:38.859
THESE COMIC BOOK COVERS HAVE
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES.

12:38.892 --> 12:45.665
FOR EXAMPLE, MATT'S COMIC HAVE A
RAVING FACING TO THE LEFT AND

12:45.698 --> 12:47.500
RAVING FACING TO THE RIGHT.

12:47.534 --> 12:50.838
KEVIN'S COMIC HAS A STARFISH ON
HIS CROWN AND A SHELF FISH ON

12:50.871 --> 12:51.438
HIS CROWN.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.406
THESE COMICS ARE BIZARRE.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.343
JOSH THE MEATBALL IS BREAKING
DOWN CITIES AND DOMINIQUE THE

12:56.376 --> 12:58.378
DEMEANOR INDICATOR FIGHTING OFF
THOSE SNAKES.

12:58.411 --> 13:01.281
I'M SURPRISED THEY DON'T HAVE
BEARDS THAT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE

13:01.314 --> 13:02.049
ME.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.452
WHY IS IT SO MEAN TO ME THIS
TIME?

13:05.485 --> 13:06.486
POTTY MOUTH?

13:06.519 --> 13:07.955
DOES MY BREATH STINK?

13:07.988 --> 13:13.360
IT DOESN'T SMELL GOOD, BUT POTTY
MOUTH?

13:13.393 --> 13:22.235
HOW DID I NOT SEE THAT?

13:22.269 --> 13:31.044
COWBOY IS ON THE RIGHT.

13:31.078 --> 13:31.711
ORANGE.

13:31.744 --> 13:32.579
MALE, MALE.

13:32.612 --> 13:35.048
THAT'S NOT MALE, THAT'S A
MONSTER, PAUL.

13:35.082 --> 13:35.849
THE HEX.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.784
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN WHAT'S
DIFFERENT?

13:37.817 --> 13:38.919
I DON'T GET IT.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.422
OH, WAIT, JESSICA IS ACTUALLY
READING A BOOK.

13:42.455 --> 13:49.129
THAT'S IT.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.698
>> I WANT TO WIN THE VETO

13:51.731 --> 13:54.134
BECAUSE I WANT TO HAVE THE
OPTION OF SENDING PAUL HOME THIS

13:54.167 --> 13:55.635
WEEK OR TAKING A SHOT AT PAUL.

13:55.668 --> 14:00.507
THIS MIGHT BE MY ONLY CHANCE TO
GET HIM OUT.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.142
WHAT THE HELL?

14:02.175 --> 14:03.410
I'M THE MEATBALL.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.978
I DON'T GET IT.

14:05.012 --> 14:08.815
MARK AND CODY ARE THE MEATBALL,
BUT I'LL TAKE IT.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.083
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

14:10.117 --> 14:14.654
I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER HAVE TO
SEE CODY AGAIN, AND HE'S GIVING

14:14.687 --> 14:16.123
ME THE LOOK.

14:16.156 --> 14:16.990
I HAD ENOUGH.

14:17.024 --> 14:23.630
I'M DONE WITH THE KID.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.733
FA LA LA LUNATIC.

14:26.766 --> 14:30.737
IT'S CREEPY CHRISTMAS CHASING ME
ON THAT SCOOTER TO GIVE ME ONE

14:30.770 --> 14:31.972
OF HER HUGS.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.741
IT'S HILARIOUS.

14:34.774 --> 14:43.283
THE BOOK IS OPEN.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.719
ELENA WOULD MESS ME UP.

14:46.753 --> 14:50.157
SO I GO BACK.

14:50.190 --> 14:55.128
I'M LOOKING AT EACH ONE, AND IT
JUST HAS TO BE MARK.

14:55.162 --> 14:59.766
MARK!

14:59.799 --> 15:01.501
>> I GOT TO WIN THAT VETO.

15:01.534 --> 15:02.569
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.104
I DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT ON THE
BLOCK.

15:04.137 --> 15:06.806
I WANT THE CONTROL MY OWN
DESTINY.

15:06.839 --> 15:11.244
SO I SEE CAMERON UP THERE, A
SUPER FAN, A LITTLE SKINNY KID.

15:11.278 --> 15:16.216
CAME IN AND STRIPPED THE FIRST
NIGHT.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.319
THIS IS KILLING ME.

15:19.352 --> 15:22.622
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHICH ONES
ARE RIGHT, WHICH ONES ARE WRONG.

15:22.655 --> 15:23.356
I'M TRYING THE BEST I.

15:23.390 --> 15:27.427
CAN I'M HUFFING AND PUFFING.

15:27.460 --> 15:36.036
AN AMATEUR MISTAKE.

15:36.069 --> 15:39.872
AS A YOUNG KID I DIDN'T READ

15:39.906 --> 15:40.940
MANY COMIC BOOKS.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.677
I WAS DOWN SHINING SHOES A AT
THE NEIGHBORHOOD BAR.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.081
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.283
>> PAUL AND I HAVE THIS SECRET
ALLIANCE.

15:50.317 --> 15:53.053
SO I HAVE BEEN PRAYING ALL DAY
AND ALL NIGHT THAT ME OR PAUL

15:53.086 --> 15:58.058
WINS THAT VETO SO THAT BOTH OF
US ARE SAFE, AND I HAVE TO

15:58.091 --> 16:00.293
BELIEVE HE'LL GO WITH ME TO THE
END OF THIS GAME.

16:00.327 --> 16:03.696
I'M NOT BUZZING IN UNTIL I GET
THEM ALL RIGHT AND I KNOW WHAT

16:03.730 --> 16:08.735
DIFFERENCES ARE IN THIS PICTURE.

16:08.768 --> 16:10.837
HE'S WRITING OLY.

16:10.870 --> 16:11.804
COME ON, GUYS.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.906
ENOUGH WITH THE WEINER JOKES.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.776
EACH TIME I GO I MAKE SURE TO
REMEMBER THREE TO FOUR COMICS AT

16:16.809 --> 16:19.412
A TIME.

16:19.446 --> 16:28.255
CODY IS A SCARECROW, WHICH IS
TOTALLY ACCURATE.

16:28.288 --> 16:32.892
NOW THAT WE HAVE ALL THE DECOYS
FIGURED OUT, IT'S TIME TO RING

16:32.925 --> 16:35.928
MY BUZZER.

16:35.962 --> 16:39.532
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS, LET'S SEE
HOW YOU DID WITH BB COMICS.

16:39.566 --> 16:44.904
ALEX, YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME
OF...

16:44.937 --> 16:47.107
>> WOW.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.510
>> 14:34.

16:50.543 --> 16:55.082
>> WHOA, HOPEFULLY I BEAT ALEX
AND I CAN WIN THAT VETO.

16:55.115 --> 17:01.521
>> KEVIN, YOU'RE NEXT.

17:01.554 --> 17:07.394
45.

17:07.427 --> 17:13.733
ALL RIGHT, JOSH, LET'S SEE IF
YOU CAN BEAT ALEX'S TIME OF

17:13.766 --> 17:14.967
14:34.

17:15.001 --> 17:23.843
>> I HOPE I FINISH FASTEST TO
MAKE A MOVE AND BACK DOOR PAUL.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.380
>> OH, THANK GOD
>> 24:36.

17:27.414 --> 17:28.348
>> ALL RIGHT.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.251
LET'S SEE IF PAUL CAN BEAT YOUR
TIME OF 14:34.

17:31.284 --> 17:33.120
PAUL?

17:33.153 --> 17:42.562
YOU FINISHED WITH A TIME OF...

17:42.595 --> 17:51.604
12:10, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU WIN
THE POWER OF VETO.

17:51.638 --> 17:56.209
>> OH, WHY AM I POTTY MOUTH.

17:56.243 --> 18:00.280
NOW THAT I HAVE THIS VETO, I GET
TO CONTINUE WITH MY PLAN TO NOT

18:00.313 --> 18:04.217
USE IT, LEAVE ALEX ON THE BLOCK,
AND GET HER OUT THIS WEEK.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.385
WHY AM I POTTY MOUTH?

18:05.418 --> 18:08.988
>> IT SUCKS BECAUSE I DID WIN
THE VETO, AND PAUL WINS IT

18:09.021 --> 18:11.824
BECAUSE NOW HE CAN PULL ME OFF
THE BLOCK AND WE'LL BOTH BE SAFE

18:11.858 --> 18:12.625
FOR THE WEEK.

18:12.659 --> 18:14.461
NOW I'M HERE TO STAY.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.463
TOP TWO, TOP TWO, TOP TWO!

18:16.496 --> 18:18.331
>> STRAIGHT UP THAT LOOKS LIKE
YOU.

18:18.365 --> 18:22.802
>> MY PLAN IS TO BACK DOOR PAUL.

18:22.835 --> 18:27.940
BACK TO PLAN "A" TO GET ALEX, A
BEAST OF A COMPETITOR OUT THIS

18:27.974 --> 18:29.276
WEEK.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.645
>> Julie: PAUL HAS WON THE
POWER OF VETO, SO IS ALEX IN FOR

18:32.679 --> 18:34.547
YET ANOTHER BLINDSIDE?

18:34.581 --> 18:35.648
FIND OUT WHEN WE RETURN.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.684
STAY WITH US.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.301
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHERRER."

18:54.334 --> 18:56.636
WHEN YOU'VE GOTTEN SO USED TO
LYING AND DECEIVING, SOMETIMES

18:56.669 --> 19:05.612
THE TRUTH CAN BE THE HARDEST
PART OF THE GAME.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.979
>> COME WITH ME.

19:07.013 --> 19:09.115
I GOT TO TALK TO YOU.

19:09.148 --> 19:13.320
>> WHEN YOU DEVELOP A REAL
FRIENDSHIP WITH SOMEONE, IT'S

19:13.353 --> 19:17.290
HARD THE TAKE SOMETHING AWAY
FROM THEM.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.392
BUT I REALLY DON'T HAVE A
CHOICE.

19:19.426 --> 19:25.332
I'D RATHER BE HONEST WITH HER
ABOUT IT NOW THAN SCREW HER OVER

19:25.365 --> 19:26.499
AT THE VERY END.

19:26.533 --> 19:32.305
>> I TRUST YOU, AND I'VE MADE AN
INSANE CONNECTION WITH YOU

19:32.339 --> 19:33.172
THROUGHOUT THIS GAME.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.408
I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I'M
THINKING.

19:35.442 --> 19:39.679
IF I USE THE VETO AND PULL YOU
OFF, SHE'S PISSED, SHE'S PISSED.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.914
I LOSE JOSH, CHRISTMAS AND KEVIN
AS A VOTE.

19:41.948 --> 19:48.621
YOU HAVE JASON, MARK, AND CODY,
SO I THINK THAT IF I USE THE

19:48.655 --> 19:54.561
VETO ON YOU, I'M PRETTY MUCH
THROWING MY GAME IN THE TRASH.

19:54.594 --> 20:04.170
>> REALLY?

20:04.203 --> 20:09.175
>> IF I MAKE THIS MOVE, I'M
SECURING MY LOSS IN THE GAME.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.244
YOU WOULD WIN.

20:11.278 --> 20:14.547
I HAVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS
WATCHING, AND THEY'D LOOK AT ME

20:14.581 --> 20:17.216
AND GO, YOU MADE THE SAME
MISTAKE AS LAST YEAR.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.488
IF I DIDN'T TAKE NICOLE TO THE
END, I MIGHT HAVE WON.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.291
IF I MAKE THIS MOVE, I LOSE.

20:24.324 --> 20:28.961
BUT IF I DON'T, I THINK THAT I
ACTUALLY HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN

20:28.995 --> 20:36.102
THIS YEAR.

20:36.135 --> 20:40.473
>> REALLY?

20:40.507 --> 20:43.643
THERE'S IN WAY THEY'RE GOING TO
KEEP ME?

20:43.676 --> 20:44.811
I'M SORRY.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.348
I FEEL LIKE I LISTENED TO
EVERYTHING YOU SAID AND NOW IT'S

20:48.381 --> 20:54.954
JUST LIKE... YOU THINK IT'S EASY
FOR ME TO THROW COMPS FOR YOU.

20:54.987 --> 20:55.988
IT'S HARD.

20:56.022 --> 20:58.090
LIKE I'M SO STUPID.

20:58.124 --> 21:01.160
I SET MYSELF UP FOR THIS.

21:01.193 --> 21:07.033
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK
THAT I'M SELFISHLY  YOU

21:07.066 --> 21:08.000
OVER BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.436
>> I FEEL LIKE THAT.

21:09.469 --> 21:13.039
I'M GOING TO BE 100% HONEST, IT
SUCKS.

21:13.072 --> 21:18.745
YOU HAVE YOUR TEAM, YOU TRUST
THEM, YOU TALK ALL SEASON ABOUT

21:18.778 --> 21:21.681
GOING TO THE END WITH THEM, AND
IT'S LIKE NO.

21:21.714 --> 21:26.185
I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I WOULD
STILL TAKE YOU IF I KNEW I WAS

21:26.218 --> 21:29.188
GOING TO LOSE.

21:29.221 --> 21:33.460
>> PAUL CAN SAY WHATEVER HE
WANTS, BUT IF I WAS IN THE SAME

21:33.493 --> 21:35.895
POSITION AS HIM, I WOULDN'T
SCREW PAUL, EVER.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.897
FRIEND.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.298
FRIENDSHIP, NO.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.900
GUMPY, YES.

21:40.933 --> 21:44.637
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT
YOU'RE ONE OF THE COOLEST PEOPLE

21:44.671 --> 21:44.971
I'VE EVER MET.

21:45.004 --> 21:47.306
>> THANKS.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.676
I HELD YOUR HAND THROUGH THIS
WHOLE GAME.

21:49.709 --> 21:54.514
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT ME
AND YOU SHOT ME IN THE BACK.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.314
NO HUGS.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.082
I'LL CRY.

21:56.115 --> 21:56.983
>> I NEED A HUG.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.217
>> NO, NO.

21:58.250 --> 22:10.730
I'LL CRY.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.865
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:12.899 --> 22:17.203
>> I ACTUALLY RESPECT AND LIKE
ALEX, SO IT SUCKS.

22:17.236 --> 22:30.650
I DON'T EVER WANT PEOPLE THE
FEEL HURT BY ME.

22:30.683 --> 22:36.288
I'VE HAD THE CHOOSE ME OVER
EVERYONE THIS ENTIRE GAME,

22:36.322 --> 22:50.102
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THEY
WOULDN'T CHOOSE ME OVER THEM.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.270
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE I CAN DO.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.138
I CAN'T HELP EVERYONE.

22:52.171 --> 22:56.843
I CAN'T SAVE EVERYONE.

22:56.876 --> 23:06.986
I HAVE TO TRIP SOMEBODY ELSE'S
CHANCES OF WINNING FOR MY OWN.

23:06.986 --> 23:15.428
I HAVE TO TRIP SOMEBODY ELSE'S
CHANCES OF WINNING FOR MY OWN.

23:15.462 --> 23:22.134
EVERYBODY, IT'S TIME FOR THE
VETO MEETING.

23:22.168 --> 23:25.404
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

23:25.438 --> 23:28.074
ALEX AND KEVIN HAVE BEEN
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

23:28.107 --> 23:30.577
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF
THE NOMINATIONS.

23:30.610 --> 23:33.946
I WANT TO GIVE BOTH NOMINEES A
CHANCE TO TELL ME WHY I SHOULD

23:33.980 --> 23:35.815
USE THE VETO TO SAVE YOU.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.249
ALEX, YOU GO FIRST.

23:37.283 --> 23:41.454
>> PAUL, YOU'RE MY LAST FRIEND
IN THE HOUSE.

23:41.488 --> 23:44.256
, YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON I TRUST
AND MY ONE CHANCE AT STAYING IN

23:44.290 --> 23:45.458
THIS HOUSE.

23:45.492 --> 23:47.827
WE ALL KNOW THAT IF YOU LEAVE ME
ON THE BLOCK I'M DEAD IN THE

23:47.860 --> 23:50.129
WATER.

23:50.162 --> 23:53.432
I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT JURY
VOTES, BUT I DON'T THINK ANY OF

23:53.466 --> 23:56.135
THESE PEOPLE WOULD HONESTLY VOTE
FOR ME AT THE END.

23:56.168 --> 24:00.873
SO I'M ASKING YOU ONE LAST TIME
TO USE THE POWER OF VETO ON ME.

24:00.907 --> 24:03.109
>> THANK YOU, ALEX.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.276
KEVIN, IT'S YOUR TIME.

24:04.310 --> 24:07.213
>> PAUL, IT'S BEEN A LONG
SUMMER, SO I'M GOING TO SAY, YOU

24:07.246 --> 24:08.414
MAKE THE DECISION.

24:08.447 --> 24:12.519
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE, I'M GOING
TO LIVE BY.

24:12.552 --> 24:16.022
>> ALEX, AS DIFFICULT AS THIS
JOURNEY HAS BEEN, THIS MOMENT

24:16.055 --> 24:18.925
RIGHT NOW IS PROBABLY THE MOST
DIFFICULT, BUT IN ORDER FOR ME

24:18.958 --> 24:23.395
TO HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE, I
HAVE TO MAKE THIS DECISION.

24:23.429 --> 24:30.903
I'M SORRY THAT I LET YOU DOWN
THIS WEEK, BUT I CHOOSE NOT TO

24:30.937 --> 24:42.849
USE THE POWER OF VETO.

24:42.882 --> 24:51.090
THIS VETO MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

25:01.634 --> 25:09.041
>> I
>> NEVER QUESTIONED ANYTHING

25:09.075 --> 25:12.478
PAUL SAID.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.314
NOW WHEN HE CAN MAKE A
FRIENDSHIP MOVE, HE'S NOT GOING

25:15.347 --> 25:16.015
TO.

25:16.048 --> 25:17.183
HE'S WORRIED ABOUT HIS OWN GAME.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.552
HE'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT I
WIN NOTHING, WHICH IS NOT

25:19.586 --> 25:24.624
FRIENDSHIP.

25:24.657 --> 25:27.660
>> Julie: UP NEXT, IT'S NOT
LOOKING GOOD FOR ALEX, BUT IT'S

25:27.694 --> 25:28.728
NOT OVER YET.

25:28.761 --> 25:32.799
PAUL AND CHRISTMAS CAST THEIR
VOTES WHEN WE RETURN.

25:32.832 --> 25:36.168
BUT FIRST, ONE WEEK FROM
TONIGHT, ONE HOUSEGUEST WILL

25:36.202 --> 25:40.673
WALK AWAY WITH A HALF MILLION
DOLLARS, BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY

25:40.707 --> 25:42.474
PRIZE WE'RE GIVING AWAY THAT
NIGHT.

25:42.508 --> 25:47.780
WE'RE ALSO HANDING SOMEONE A
CHECK FOR $25,000.

25:47.814 --> 25:53.252
TO VOTE FOR AMERICA'S FAVORITE
HOUSEGUEST, GO TO

25:53.285 --> 25:53.653
CBS.COM/BBVOTE.

25:53.686 --> 25:59.158
STAY WITH US.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.772
>> Julie: WELCOME BACK TO "BIG
BROTHER."

26:12.805 --> 26:15.708
KEVIN OR ALEX, WHO WILL BECOME
THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF THE JURY?

26:15.742 --> 26:19.912
LET'S HEAD BACK TO THE WILL
LIVING ROOM TO FIND OUT.

26:19.946 --> 26:22.148
>> Julie: HELLO, HOUSEGUESTS.

26:22.181 --> 26:24.583
KEVIN, ALEX, IN JUST A FEW
MOMENTS POWELL AND CHRISTMAS

26:24.617 --> 26:27.754
WILL CAST THEIR VOTES TO EVICT,
BUT BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH

26:27.787 --> 26:31.090
HAVE ONE FINAL CHANCE TO PLEAD
YOUR CASE WITH ONE BRIEF

26:31.123 --> 26:32.424
STATEMENT.

26:32.458 --> 26:33.592
KEVIN, YOU'RE FIRST.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.962
>> EVENING, JULIE, HOW ARE YOU
DOING?

26:35.995 --> 26:38.464
FIRST I'D LIKE THE SAY HI TO
EVERYONE BACK HOME, TO MY

26:38.497 --> 26:39.732
FAMILY.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.934
I MISS THEM AND I LOVE THEM AND
I THINK ABOUT THEM ALL THE TIME.

26:41.968 --> 26:44.637
TO THE HOUSEGUESTS, IT'S BEEN A
LONG SUMMER.

26:44.671 --> 26:47.306
IT'S MY THIRD STRAIGHT TIME FOR
BEING A LIVE EVIFNLINGS I'VE

26:47.339 --> 26:49.776
BEEN FIGHTING AS HARD AS I CAN
TO GET HERE.

26:49.809 --> 26:52.244
WHEN YOU GROW UP IN BOSTON, YOU
HAVE THE FIGHT.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.079
THAT'S HOW IT IS.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.881
I WANT TO KEEP FIGHTING TO GET
THROUGH.

26:54.914 --> 26:58.550
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN GREAT, ALL OF
YOU, YOU GET TO THIS SPOT.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.652

38:58.169 --> 38:59.538
AND FINALE NIGHT FOR SURE.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.940
WE SAW YOU LOOKING VERY
EMOTIONAL OUT THERE.

39:01.973 --> 39:03.208
YOU STILL LOOK EMOTIONAL RIGHT
NOW.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.342
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

39:04.376 --> 39:08.414
>> WORDS CAN'T EXPLAIN HOW
BIZARRE AND INSANE IT IS TO BE

39:08.447 --> 39:11.049
IN THIS SPOT AGAIN FOR THE
SECOND YEAR IN A ROW.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.620
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD DO IT.

39:14.653 --> 39:18.089
>> Julie: WELL, YOU DID.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.691
KEVIN, THREE TIMES ON THE BLOCK.

39:19.725 --> 39:22.628
>> THREE TIMES IN A ROW, IN SIX
DAYS.

39:22.661 --> 39:23.962
>> Julie: IN SIX DAYS.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.196
THAT'S STRESSFUL.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.599
ARE YOU SURPRISED, KEVIN, THAT
YOU SURVIVED ONCE AGAIN AND THAT

39:27.633 --> 39:29.501
YOU MADE IT TO THE FINAL FOUR?

39:29.535 --> 39:31.803
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED.

39:31.837 --> 39:36.207
IT'S SURPRISING THAT I'M HERE,
THE AGE DIFFERENCE.

39:36.241 --> 39:37.409
IT'S BEEN REALLY DIFFICULT.

39:37.443 --> 39:42.247
BUT I'M HAPPY I'M HERE WITH
THREE OTHER HOUSEGUESTS THAT

39:42.280 --> 39:42.948
DESERVE TO BE HERE.

39:42.981 --> 39:43.982
I'M VERY HAPPY.

39:44.015 --> 39:44.483
VERY EXCITED.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.418
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

39:46.452 --> 39:46.818
JOSH.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.019
>> HEY, JULIE.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.722
>> Julie: WE SAW A LOT OF
TEARS FROM YOU THIS WEEK.

39:50.756 --> 39:51.723
>> YEAH.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.192
>> Julie: WHY WAS THIS WEEK SO
EMOTIONAL FOR YOU?

39:54.225 --> 39:56.762
>> I'VE GROWN TO LEFT EVERYBODY
THAT WAS LEFT IN THE HOUSE.

39:56.795 --> 39:59.431
THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT WERE
WITH ME SINCE DAY ONE, SO

39:59.465 --> 40:02.167
LETTING GO OF ALEX WAS ONE OF
THE HARDEST THINGS.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.670
SHE'S BEEN NOTHING BUT A GREAT
FRIEND, SO IT'S GOTTEN DOWN TO

40:04.703 --> 40:08.474
THE POINT WHERE IT'S JUST A GAME
MOVE, BUT I LOVE HER TO DEATH

40:08.507 --> 40:11.643
AND I HOPE WE CAN BE FRIENDS
OUTSIDE OF THIS.

40:11.677 --> 40:12.243
>> Julie: CHRISTMAS.

40:12.277 --> 40:13.411
>> HELLO.

40:13.445 --> 40:16.214
>> Julie: I'M GOING TO LIGHTEN
THE MOOD A LITTLE BIT.

40:16.247 --> 40:18.617
LET'S THINK BACK TO BB COMICS.

40:18.650 --> 40:24.389
WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE BB COMIC
CHARACTER THIS YEAR?

40:24.422 --> 40:26.124
>> I DON'T KNOW.

40:26.157 --> 40:28.393
THEY WERE ALL REALLY AMAZING.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.797
I REALLY LOVED THE MEATBALL ONE
BECAUSE HE THINKS HE CALLS

40:31.830 --> 40:34.766
EVERYBODY ELSE MEATBALL, BUT
REALLY HE'S THE MEATBALL, BUT I

40:34.800 --> 40:37.869
LOVE THE FACT THEY MADE ME A
LUNATIC.

40:37.903 --> 40:40.806
I DON'T KNOW, THEY WERE ALL
REALLY PRETTY SPOT ON.

40:40.839 --> 40:42.040
>> Julie: ALL RIGHT.

40:42.073 --> 40:45.744
WELL, PAUL, I DON'T FOE IF YOU
LIKED HEARING THAT, BECAUSE

40:45.777 --> 40:49.114
PAUL, YOU WERE NOT HAPPY AT ALL
WITH YOUR COMIC BECOME

40:49.147 --> 40:50.081

40:50.115 --> 40:54.520
SO WHAT CHARACTER WOULD YOU

GUMBY.

41:03.328 --> 41:04.295
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

41:04.329 --> 41:07.733
>> DREW: ARE YOU SAYING
PRESIDENTY MOUTH WASN'T

41:07.766 --> 41:11.169
ACCURATE -- POTTY MOUTH WASN'T
ACCURATE?

41:11.202 --> 41:14.205
>> WE LLL...

41:14.239 --> 41:15.273
>> Julie: OKAY.

41:15.306 --> 41:17.008
WE'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT.

41:17.042 --> 41:20.011
CONGRATULATION, FINAL FOUR AND
GOOD NIGHT, HOUSEGUESTS.

41:20.045 --> 41:23.081
WE'RE JUST ONE WEEK AWAY FROM
