Hey, Bundy!
I had steak tonight.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.701
What are you havin'?

01:41.701 --> 01:45.767
If I was the mailman,
I'd be having your wife.

01:49.100 --> 01:50.834
Don't worry
about me, Donnelly.

01:50.834 --> 01:51.834
I'll have supper.

01:52.834 --> 01:55.133
I better have supper.

01:55.133 --> 01:57.334

[RINGING]

02:00.734 --> 02:02.567
Oh!

Oh, God.
The idiot'll be home soon.

02:08.434 --> 02:11.133
Oh. Ha-ha-ha.

02:11.133 --> 02:13.400
Hi, idiot.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.567
Peg, in the privacy
of our own home,

02:15.567 --> 02:17.634
could you call me
Mr. Idiot?

02:17.634 --> 02:19.467
Peg, you're not gonna
bother me tonight,

02:19.467 --> 02:20.634
because you know why?

02:20.634 --> 02:23.400
I know you cooked me supper,
didn't ya?

02:26.234 --> 02:27.501
Dessert?

02:30.934 --> 02:33.000
Oh, honey, what
do you want from me?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You're at work
10 hours a day.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.167
Can't you find something
to eat in all that time?

02:38.167 --> 02:42.067
God! This is a home,
not a restaurant.

02:42.067 --> 02:43.534
I know, Peg.

02:43.534 --> 02:47.234
If it was a restaurant,
we'd have a clean bathroom.

02:47.234 --> 02:49.234
Can't you be
like other husbands?

02:49.234 --> 02:51.300
Just come home,
go upstairs

02:51.300 --> 02:54.834
and sit there
quietly till morning.

02:54.834 --> 02:55.968
Excuse me a second, Peg.

03:02.567 --> 03:06.701
What's this? Beef stew?
Made from scratch?

03:09.434 --> 03:12.534
Whoa ho-ho-ho-ho-ho.
What a wife!

03:14.767 --> 03:17.200
Peg, I'm starving to death.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.000
I can't live like this.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.200
Now, I'm telling you,
Peg,

03:20.200 --> 03:21.968
I want you to put
something in that oven,

03:21.968 --> 03:24.467
either food or my head.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.901
Either way, the neighbors'll
smell something cookin'.

03:26.901 --> 03:29.133
Now, Peg, I'm making
a stand here. I'm not kidding.

03:29.133 --> 03:30.834
I want a meal.
I want it now. Get it?

03:30.834 --> 03:32.968
Huh?

03:32.968 --> 03:35.434
What'd you say, Al?
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

03:35.434 --> 03:37.868
Jeez, I don't know.
Just something
about me being a man.

03:37.868 --> 03:39.534
It wasn't important.

03:41.868 --> 03:43.467
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.901
Kids, I'm glad you're home
because I'm taking a poll.

03:45.901 --> 03:48.133
Where are we
gonna put a pole?

03:50.133 --> 03:51.701
Well, we can, uh,
put it in your head

03:51.701 --> 03:55.567
so we have a place to hang
the sign that says "duh."

03:57.968 --> 03:59.167
Oh, thanks.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.901
You wouldn't let me
get a nose earring,

04:00.901 --> 04:02.968
but you're gonna put
a pole in my head?

04:06.868 --> 04:09.133
Peg, are you sure
you didn't have
a one-night stand

04:09.133 --> 04:11.067
with Abbott and Costello?

04:14.467 --> 04:18.233
No. I'm a one-stooge
woman, honey.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.367
All right, we're
going to have a vote.

04:20.367 --> 04:21.868

gonna have a po--

your mother cook...

04:28.133 --> 04:30.267
None.

04:30.267 --> 04:31.968
Well, that's it, Peg.
You're cookin'.

04:31.968 --> 04:34.100
I don't care if it's
breakfast, lunch or dinner,

04:34.100 --> 04:36.367
but I want it hot.
And I'll tell
you something else.

04:36.367 --> 04:37.667
I want it on a plate.

04:40.667 --> 04:43.300
Boy. If I'd known
it was gonna be like this...

04:43.300 --> 04:45.634
Well, Peg, the neighbors
are laughing at me.

04:45.634 --> 04:49.267
And everyone at school,
too, Dad.

04:49.267 --> 04:50.300
Well, that's it.

From now on,
this family is gonna be

we're gonna eat!

04:55.200 --> 04:57.534
Yes, food!
All right!

04:57.534 --> 04:59.934
Okay, I'll make
one meal.

04:59.934 --> 05:02.133
But it's not
gonna be good.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.601
That's all we ask.

05:04.601 --> 05:05.734
Oh, Mom,
one more thing.

05:05.734 --> 05:06.801
Oh.

05:06.801 --> 05:10.834
You're spinning me
right into PMS.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.300
It's the school nurse,
Mom.

05:12.300 --> 05:14.701
She said it's time to get
our annual dental checkups.

05:14.701 --> 05:15.767
Oh.

05:15.767 --> 05:18.534
Okay. We'll make
an appointment.

their dental checkups.

your dental forms
in the morning.

Ah. Well,
that wasn't so bad.

Yeah. Thank God we didn't
need tetanus shots.

that little pin.

but doesn't anybody know

this is against
the law?

05:56.334 --> 05:59.767
So is dressing up a chicken
and calling it your wife.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.367
I am not a chicken.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.534
Why does he keep
calling me a chicken?

06:17.667 --> 06:19.234
Now, Marcie.

06:19.234 --> 06:20.934
Don't get
your feathers ruffled.

06:23.601 --> 06:25.534
Look, guys,
I don't mean to be rude,

06:25.534 --> 06:27.868
but we've got some
x-rays to sketch.

06:27.868 --> 06:30.234
This is a disgrace.

06:30.234 --> 06:32.567
Don't you understand?
You are robbing your children

06:32.567 --> 06:35.167
of one of life's
great experiences.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.200
I love to go
to the dentist.

06:37.200 --> 06:40.200
A man in white
hovering over me

06:40.200 --> 06:44.000
while I'm trapped
helpless in a chair.

He cleans me.

06:45.501 --> 06:46.667
He flosses me.

06:46.667 --> 06:49.934
His instrument's
alive in my mouth.

06:52.734 --> 06:55.267
And just when I think
I can't take anymore,

06:55.267 --> 06:57.434
he says,
"Good girl, Marcie.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.767
You can spit now."

to the dentist.

Well, you should.

see their dentist

07:12.667 --> 07:14.100
at least twice a month.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.167

a cavity my whole life.

to the dentist.

that delightful breath.

you've never had a cavity?

known for one thing.

07:39.634 --> 07:42.133
The sex drive
of a carbuncle?

07:44.634 --> 07:47.634
Well, actually, we were known
for two things.

07:47.634 --> 07:52.067
One: always having
the knack of finding
just the right woman...

07:54.501 --> 07:57.033
And teeth.
Big strong choppers.

the teeth, will ya?

Well, the green one
looks pretty good.

08:13.400 --> 08:15.901
And some might be bothered
by that black one.

08:15.901 --> 08:17.767
But the one that's
actually bleeding

08:17.767 --> 08:19.801
could be a problem
starting.

08:19.801 --> 08:21.434
Al, you should go
to the dentist.

If my teeth don't hurt,

but it's almost
1:00 in the morning,

kissing my daughter.

Oh, darn, Bill.

It's so late,
I thought that'd be open.

We've got a real problem
here, Kelly.

09:34.767 --> 09:37.000
I know, Daddy.
We were just doing our homework.

I'm a good girl.

It's just that
my teeth are killing me.

that darn Marcie voodooed me.

and see if my teeth are okay?

that's fizzing.

go to the dentist?

10:03.300 --> 10:04.300
No dentist.

10:04.300 --> 10:06.701
What I need
is an ice-cold beer.

10:12.868 --> 10:13.868
That's cold.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.634
Mm-hm.

10:25.634 --> 10:29.868
Nothing like a cold beer
on a hot night.

10:29.868 --> 10:31.033
That's good.

10:31.033 --> 10:34.167
Are you afraid
of the dentist, Daddy?

Kelly, I'm
a grown man.

So, yes, of course,
I'm deathly afraid
of the dentist.

10:39.934 --> 10:43.100
Fear is nothing
to be ashamed of, Daddy.

10:43.100 --> 10:45.133
Let me tell you
a little story.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.000
I was afraid once.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.734
It was two years ago,
so I was, um...8.

10:53.100 --> 10:56.367
Anyway, I missed the bus
back from school,

10:56.367 --> 10:57.801
so I had to walk home.

10:57.801 --> 10:59.934

pretty dark.

Oops.

11:12.067 --> 11:14.100
Anyway, I cut
through this alley.

11:14.100 --> 11:16.167
And I heard this noise.

11:16.167 --> 11:18.601
I turned,
and there they were.

Oh, God, it was great.

and we limboed.

Then we had cake.
And we painted
each other's toenails.

have long to live.

of the fear.

I was wearing my pink dress
with the little sparkles
on the collar,

12:00.334 --> 12:03.634
and I was afraid it would
clash with the toenails
I just painted.

over his face
