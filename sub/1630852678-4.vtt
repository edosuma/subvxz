11:44.855 --> 11:46.421
- Okay.

11:46.423 --> 11:49.257
I'm sorry I ruined your dinner.
Can I sit?

11:49.259 --> 11:51.259
- No, no, you got your
watch.

11:51.261 --> 11:53.128
So...

11:53.130 --> 11:54.496
- Okay.

11:54.498 --> 11:56.931
I was just telling my friend
you are a very

11:56.933 --> 11:59.601
beautiful woman, and I
would always see you

11:59.603 --> 12:01.636
at the bank and admire
you.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.605
- Okay, thank you.
- So, I just wanted to say hi.

12:03.607 --> 12:07.275
- Yeah.
Hi.

12:07.277 --> 12:08.777
- And if he made you feel
bad,

12:08.779 --> 12:11.413
I will gladly kick his ass
again.

12:11.415 --> 12:12.714
- That's not funny.

12:12.716 --> 12:17.118
- You are right, too soon.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.586
Can I buy you a drink?

12:18.588 --> 12:21.189
- No, I'm surprised they
even let you back in here

12:21.191 --> 12:23.858
after that fight.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.794
- Well, I have a confession.

12:28.265 --> 12:30.465
It's my restaurant.

12:31.902 --> 12:34.702
- [chuckles]
Yeah okay, whatever.

12:34.704 --> 12:38.006
They have a ton of these
around the country.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.541
So whatever.

12:39.543 --> 12:41.576
- Yeah, I know.

12:44.815 --> 12:46.948
- Why didn't you tell me?

12:46.950 --> 12:50.518
- I didn't want your boyfriend
to sue me.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.354
- He's not my boyfriend.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.824
- Well, whoever he is.

12:59.229 --> 13:00.795
- I see.

13:03.433 --> 13:06.201
Congratulations on all your
success.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.570
- Thank you.

13:08.572 --> 13:10.572
Are you sure you don't
want that drink?

13:10.574 --> 13:14.409
- No, no, I should probably
be going anyway.

13:14.411 --> 13:19.380
- Well, here's my number,

13:19.382 --> 13:21.983
if I can ever make it up
to you.

13:21.985 --> 13:24.018
- No, thank you.

13:24.020 --> 13:26.921
- Sabrina, just take it.

13:26.923 --> 13:29.591
Just take it.

13:29.593 --> 13:31.593
I can have valet get your car.

13:31.595 --> 13:34.162
- No, I'm gonna take a
rideshare.

13:34.164 --> 13:36.931
- Oh, well, in that case,
I can take you home.

13:36.933 --> 13:39.100
- No.

13:39.102 --> 13:42.203
- Okay, I get it.

13:42.205 --> 13:44.172
- Goodnight.

13:44.174 --> 13:45.573
- Goodnight.

13:48.278 --> 13:51.913
- Dammit, Gary.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.482
I should call him and say
thank you.

13:54.484 --> 13:56.885
Thank you for the
Rolls Royce, Gary.

13:56.887 --> 13:59.587
No.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.322
Thank you for all the...

14:01.324 --> 14:03.091
-- that!

14:03.093 --> 14:05.860
I'm gonna block you,
that's what I'm gonna do.

14:05.862 --> 14:09.230
- [phone buzzing]
Oh.

14:12.536 --> 14:14.636
Hi.
- ROBIN: Hi.

14:14.638 --> 14:16.638
Can you hear me?
I'm on the plane.

14:16.640 --> 14:18.773
- ANDI: Yeah, I can hear
you fine.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.409
I'm glad everything worked
out.

14:21.411 --> 14:24.345
- Yeah, it did.

14:24.347 --> 14:26.247
- How's the flight?

14:26.249 --> 14:29.150
- It would be a lot better
if you were here with me.

14:29.152 --> 14:30.818
- That's sweet.

14:30.820 --> 14:33.621
- ROBIN: I'm being honest.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.590
- I'm sure you had several
other women

14:35.592 --> 14:37.625
you could have called.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.661
- Yes, there are.
But I don't want to be

14:39.663 --> 14:41.462
with anyone but you.

14:41.464 --> 14:46.534
- Hmm.
Thanks for saying that.

14:46.536 --> 14:48.169
How are you?

14:48.171 --> 14:50.538
- I'm really good.

14:50.540 --> 14:52.106
I'm just thinking about you.

14:54.578 --> 14:57.278
- What are you thinking
about?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.981
- Just thinking about how
beautiful you are

14:59.983 --> 15:03.718
and how much I enjoy
kissing you.

15:06.256 --> 15:10.892
- Can you be more specific?

15:10.894 --> 15:14.796
- I love the way I feel
when we're together

15:14.798 --> 15:18.399
and you're looking into
my eyes.

15:18.401 --> 15:21.636
- Yeah, that feels amazing.

15:21.638 --> 15:24.973
- What are you doing now?

15:24.975 --> 15:28.409
- Nothing.
Just chilling at home,

15:28.411 --> 15:30.411
thinking about you.

15:30.413 --> 15:34.782
I'm sorry, I know you're on
a plane, is your team there?

15:34.784 --> 15:37.986
- There's no one on this
jet but me, the pilots,

15:37.988 --> 15:41.022
and the flight attendant,
who's up front.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.292
- Oh, that's right,
you're on a private jet.

15:44.294 --> 15:48.029
[giggles]
- ROBIN: Mmhmm.

15:48.031 --> 15:53.267
So tell me what you want
me to do for you right now.

15:53.269 --> 15:57.605
- I would really love it if
you were kissing all over me.

15:57.607 --> 15:58.906
- Yeah?

15:58.908 --> 16:01.509
- ANDI: And if you were
putting your hands

16:01.511 --> 16:06.514
all over my--
- [phone buzzing]

16:06.516 --> 16:09.083
- Don't stop.

16:09.085 --> 16:12.820
- Um, I think I should,
actually.

16:12.822 --> 16:14.922
- Oh, she's a tease.

16:14.924 --> 16:18.826
- No, she's a woman who's
tired and should go to bed.

16:18.828 --> 16:23.831
- Okay, so when will I see
you again?

16:23.833 --> 16:26.968
- Next time you're stateside.

16:26.970 --> 16:28.636
- So you're not gonna come?

16:28.638 --> 16:31.105
- ANDI: I'm sorry, not this
time.

16:31.107 --> 16:36.110
But it gives us something
to look forward to.

16:36.112 --> 16:39.847
- Yeah, I agree.

16:39.849 --> 16:43.685
- I'm gonna say goodnight now.

16:43.687 --> 16:47.121
- Yeah, go call him.

16:47.123 --> 16:48.589
- What?

16:48.591 --> 16:51.793
- I heard the phone, Andi.

16:51.795 --> 16:53.361
- Robin--

16:53.363 --> 16:56.297
- ROBIN: Hey, you know what?
It's fine, I get it.

16:56.299 --> 16:58.866
You don't belong to me.

16:58.868 --> 17:01.536
- No, I don't.

17:01.538 --> 17:04.472
- Not yet.

17:04.474 --> 17:07.208
- Goodnight, Robin.

17:07.210 --> 17:08.843
- Goodnight.

17:08.845 --> 17:10.778
- [chuckles]

17:13.817 --> 17:16.250
I'm definitely not
calling Gary.

17:20.090 --> 17:25.993
- [talking indistinctly]

17:27.363 --> 17:30.565
- Ahhh.
- Let's go, let's go.

17:34.170 --> 17:36.738
- Ooh.
- Alright, alright.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.506
- Hey, hey, I'm out.

17:38.508 --> 17:41.576
Sub in for me, bruh.

17:41.578 --> 17:43.211
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.681
- Who won?

17:46.683 --> 17:48.649
- We did.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.418
- Y'all play late.

17:50.420 --> 17:52.920
- Yeah, it's the only time
we can all get away.

17:52.922 --> 17:55.623
- I see.
- And it's good exercise.

17:55.625 --> 17:58.326
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

17:58.328 --> 18:00.361
I mean, they'll play until,
like, one or two

18:00.363 --> 18:02.730
in the morning.
- Oh wow, anyone can play?

18:02.732 --> 18:04.832
- Yeah.
- Mmm.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.768
- What's up, Karen?
How you doing?

18:06.770 --> 18:09.036
- Hi.
- You look nice.

18:09.038 --> 18:12.707
- Thank you.

18:12.709 --> 18:15.042
- Umm...
- You can go, yeah.

18:15.044 --> 18:16.811
- GARY: Okay, it's good
to see you.

18:16.813 --> 18:18.412
- Okay, I'll get back to
you later.

18:18.414 --> 18:19.947
Yeah.
- Alright, well we need

18:19.949 --> 18:21.415
you over here, bro.
- Got you.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.650
- Alright?
- Yeah.

18:22.652 --> 18:26.921
Alright, copy that.
- Good seeing you, Karen.

18:26.923 --> 18:28.823
- Um... [clearing throat]

18:28.825 --> 18:31.726
Like I said, I wanted to
talk to you.

18:31.728 --> 18:33.294
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:33.296 --> 18:34.929
- What's up?

18:34.931 --> 18:36.430
- Well, I have something to
tell you,

18:36.432 --> 18:40.034
but I don't want to tell you
here with everybody.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.303
- Okay, uh...

18:42.305 --> 18:44.372
Well, where do you want to go?

18:44.374 --> 18:46.440
- Not my house.

18:46.442 --> 18:49.177
- Why not?

18:49.179 --> 18:50.945
- I think I know
what'll happen

18:50.947 --> 18:52.313
if I take you home.

18:52.315 --> 18:54.382
And that would not be
good.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.350
- Wouldn't be good for
who?

18:56.352 --> 18:59.020
- I don't wanna add any
more confusion to all this.

18:59.022 --> 19:01.122
- What if I told you I can
be the strong one

19:01.124 --> 19:03.057
for us tonight?
- You'd have to be very,

19:03.059 --> 19:05.660
very strong.
- I will be.

19:08.665 --> 19:11.666
- No. [coughs]

19:11.668 --> 19:13.901
- You sure?

19:13.903 --> 19:15.536
- [sighs]

19:15.538 --> 19:17.839
No, I'm not sure.

19:17.841 --> 19:20.041
- Okay, then I'm coming.

19:20.043 --> 19:22.343
I'll follow you.

19:22.345 --> 19:24.011
[chuckles]

19:24.013 --> 19:26.948
- Okay.
- Yeah, let me get my things.

19:26.950 --> 19:28.482
- [sighs]

19:28.484 --> 19:29.717
- Shit.

19:31.855 --> 19:34.956
- Zac?
- Karen.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.390
- You play with him?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.693
- No, I don't.

19:38.695 --> 19:41.195
I'm on the opposite side.

19:41.197 --> 19:42.930
- I never actually saw
you here before.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.800
- I know.

19:45.802 --> 19:48.002
[unintelligible]
- AARON: Okay.

19:48.004 --> 19:49.937
You ready?
- Yeah.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.172
- Okay.
- Yeah.

19:51.174 --> 19:53.007
- Let's get out of here.

19:56.179 --> 19:58.546
- AARON: Hey Gary, I'll check
you later, brother.

20:05.755 --> 20:08.856
- Yo, I'm tapping out, man.
Y'all. Good game, man.

20:08.858 --> 20:12.260
Good game.
Ah, dog.

20:12.262 --> 20:14.328
- Yo, what's your name, yo?
- I'm Gary.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.330
- Yo, Zac, bro.
- Nice to meet you, brother.

20:16.332 --> 20:18.599
- Yeah, bro,
- Good game.

20:18.601 --> 20:19.800
Oh--

20:19.802 --> 20:20.935
- He good, he good,
he good.

20:20.937 --> 20:22.136
- You nice too.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.371
- Little bit, little bit
other something.

20:23.373 --> 20:26.240
- Yeah.
- So, what do you do?

20:26.242 --> 20:28.376
- Oh man, I'm a hedge
fund manager, man.

20:28.378 --> 20:30.077
What about yourself?
- I do stocks.

20:30.079 --> 20:31.879
- Stocks?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:31.881 --> 20:33.080
How long you been
doing that?

20:33.082 --> 20:34.482
- Long time.

20:34.484 --> 20:35.950
- Shit, you got a card or
something? Like--

20:35.952 --> 20:38.719
- Yeah man, we'll go to the
car, I'll get you my card.

20:38.721 --> 20:40.021
- That's your car?

20:40.023 --> 20:42.156
- Yeah, that's my, that's
my one right there.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.191
- That's, that's nice, yo.
- Car nice too.

20:44.193 --> 20:46.460
- I mean, it ain't as nice
as yours, but I'm doing aight.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.030
You know what I'm saying?
- It's good, it's all good.

20:49.032 --> 20:50.564
- I appreciate it, 'cause you
know I...

20:50.566 --> 20:52.733
Can I ask some questions?
You know what I'm saying?

20:52.735 --> 20:54.802
I'd rather ask a brother
'cause I be asking

20:54.804 --> 20:57.004
white boys and I don't
know what a damn thing

20:57.006 --> 20:58.339
they saying.
- I already understand,

20:58.341 --> 21:00.374
man, I already understand.
That's why I'm here.

21:00.376 --> 21:01.876
- I appreciate you.
- I got you, man.

21:01.878 --> 21:04.078
Hey listen, next time we play,
you're on my team again.

21:04.080 --> 21:05.680
Alright?
- Say less.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.482
- Aight, cool, cool, cool.
- That shit is nice, though.

21:10.453 --> 21:15.890
- ♪

21:18.962 --> 21:21.595
- Good morning.

21:21.597 --> 21:25.166
- I told you to stop
watching me sleep.

21:25.168 --> 21:29.070
- I can't, I love it.
You look so beautiful.

21:29.072 --> 21:33.074
- Not in the morning.
- [chuckling]

21:33.076 --> 21:35.609
I like you like this.

21:35.611 --> 21:38.179
- Well, thank you, but I
need to pull it together

21:38.181 --> 21:41.882
a little bit.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.051
- Okay.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.821
- How was the game?

21:46.823 --> 21:49.390
- It was good.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.658
- Good.

21:53.196 --> 21:55.196
- That's all you wanna
know?

21:55.198 --> 21:57.965
- Yeah.
Zac, I said I'm all in.

21:57.967 --> 22:00.935
I trust you and your word
is your word,

22:00.937 --> 22:05.639
I'm gonna believe you until you
give me a reason not to.

22:08.578 --> 22:10.011
- I like that.

22:10.013 --> 22:13.080
- Yeah.
- That's good.

22:13.082 --> 22:14.882
- Mmhmm, yeah.

22:14.884 --> 22:16.584
But also deadly.

22:16.586 --> 22:18.052
- Stop.

22:18.054 --> 22:19.520
- No, I'm serious.

22:19.522 --> 22:24.258
You had just better been
where you said were.

22:24.260 --> 22:26.694
- I was.
- Okay.

22:26.696 --> 22:28.996
- Just had to stop and pick
something up.

22:28.998 --> 22:31.799
- Oh, where?

22:31.801 --> 22:33.501
- This chick's house.

22:38.074 --> 22:40.875
- You didn't mention that.

22:40.877 --> 22:43.010
- I didn't?

22:43.012 --> 22:46.113
Oh.

22:46.115 --> 22:47.882
- And that's a lie.

22:47.884 --> 22:50.317
- Is it? Really?

22:50.319 --> 22:54.355
- Really? Yes.
Omission, Zac.

22:54.357 --> 22:59.193
And that's a problem for me.

22:59.195 --> 23:01.362
- That's interesting.

23:01.364 --> 23:03.097
Omission is [unintelligible].

23:03.099 --> 23:05.366
- Zac, I'm telling you right
now,

23:05.368 --> 23:08.536
if you -- with my heart,
you will lose.

23:08.538 --> 23:10.938
- Alright, calm down.
Just relax.

23:10.940 --> 23:13.007
- [unintelligible]

23:13.009 --> 23:16.077
- Wait, wait, wait, Fatima.
Fatima.

23:16.079 --> 23:17.411
Are you serious?
- Yes.

23:17.413 --> 23:22.516
- You see the frustration?
You see the frustration?

23:22.518 --> 23:25.152
You seriously mad?
- Yes!

23:25.154 --> 23:26.687
- Come on, Fatima, don't
be like that.

23:26.689 --> 23:29.924
- No Zac, go to hell.
- Come on, Fatima. Fatima!

23:35.031 --> 23:36.897
Two...one...

23:41.003 --> 23:42.636
- Zac!

23:47.977 --> 23:51.045
My gosh, wow!

23:51.047 --> 23:52.680
Really?

23:52.682 --> 23:55.282
- This is what I went to get.

23:55.284 --> 23:58.986
- Oh my goodness.

23:58.988 --> 24:01.188
- She's a photographer.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.390
There's nothing going on
between us.

24:03.392 --> 24:06.093
[unintelligible]
- Yeah.

24:06.095 --> 24:07.661
Wow.

24:07.663 --> 24:10.030
- Yeah, she gave me that
camera,

24:10.032 --> 24:14.835
I learned how to use it,
she printed these for me.

24:14.837 --> 24:16.070
- Wow.

24:16.072 --> 24:17.838
- You always say that you
all in,

24:17.840 --> 24:21.976
but, um...I wanted to show you
that I was all in.

24:21.978 --> 24:25.880
And thank you for trusting me.

24:25.882 --> 24:31.852
And just know that I'm
never gonna -- you over.

24:31.854 --> 24:34.155
- Don't say that.

24:34.157 --> 24:37.558
- I mean it.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.794
- Let's, let's do this.
- Mmhmm.

24:40.796 --> 24:45.166
- If you are ever feeling
like that, you'll tell me.

24:45.168 --> 24:46.700
- I promise.

24:46.702 --> 24:51.205
If you promise to do the
same.

24:51.207 --> 24:52.873
- I would never -- over
you.

24:52.875 --> 24:55.709
I'm not gonna do that.

24:55.711 --> 24:58.979
- I believe you.

24:58.981 --> 25:01.282
- I can't believe you took all
these pictures.

25:01.284 --> 25:03.350
[chuckling]
- Look at you.

25:03.352 --> 25:04.752
- This is crazy.

25:04.754 --> 25:09.089
This is like the sweetest,
most creepy thing

25:09.091 --> 25:10.624
anybody's ever done for me.

25:10.626 --> 25:13.227
- Look at how beautiful you
look.

25:13.229 --> 25:14.495
With your mouth open.

25:14.497 --> 25:16.297
- Yeah, see, drooling.

25:16.299 --> 25:17.765
I told you.

25:17.767 --> 25:21.969
Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

25:21.971 --> 25:23.771
- [moaning]

25:23.773 --> 25:26.507
- Do not start that.
No, I gotta shower.

25:26.509 --> 25:27.808
- Come on!
- No.

25:27.810 --> 25:31.145
- Yes, come on.
- No, I gotta go--

25:31.147 --> 25:33.147
- Come on, come on, come on...

25:39.589 --> 25:42.056
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
- You see?

25:46.362 --> 25:48.329
- What?

25:48.331 --> 25:51.198
- We didn't do anything last
night.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.934
- Thank you.

25:53.936 --> 25:56.570
- How are you?

25:56.572 --> 25:59.807
- I'm okay.
Yeah.

25:59.809 --> 26:05.412
- You said you had something
to tell me, right?

26:05.414 --> 26:07.214
- Oh, um...

26:09.385 --> 26:13.420
No, actually.

26:13.422 --> 26:15.656
- Are you sure?

26:15.658 --> 26:20.494
- I'm just not ready to talk
about it yet.

26:20.496 --> 26:22.529
- Okay.

26:22.531 --> 26:24.732
- I'm sorry.

26:30.573 --> 26:34.174
- Is it about Zac?
- No, no.

26:34.176 --> 26:37.344
- Are you sure?

26:37.346 --> 26:42.016
- Well, kind of, actually.

26:42.018 --> 26:45.119
- Okay.
- Aaron,

26:45.121 --> 26:46.620
I don't want to be on

26:46.622 --> 26:48.989
this emotional roller coaster
with you.

26:48.991 --> 26:51.992
So it's good.

26:51.994 --> 26:54.928
Everything's all good.

26:54.930 --> 26:58.499
- What does "it's all good"
mean?

26:58.501 --> 27:01.402
- Just that. You know?

27:01.404 --> 27:06.640
I'm, I'm, I'm processing
a lot and it's fine.

27:06.642 --> 27:12.112
And you know, I know I
ain't been the easiest to--

27:12.114 --> 27:17.985
- Karen, I love you.

27:17.987 --> 27:20.120
Okay? I love you whether
it's easy or hard.

27:20.122 --> 27:22.890
Let's just be clear.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.858
- You love me?

27:24.860 --> 27:28.696
- Yes. I do.

27:30.966 --> 27:33.834
- You love me, and this is
not fair to you.

27:33.836 --> 27:35.402
- What do you think isn't
fair?

27:35.404 --> 27:37.805
- All of this, this situation
that I'm in.

27:37.807 --> 27:40.674
- Can we just say that I'll
be here

27:40.676 --> 27:43.043
until I can't anymore?

27:43.045 --> 27:45.646
- Yeah, well, you've come
close a few times.

27:45.648 --> 27:51.218
- And yet I'm still here.

27:51.220 --> 27:55.556
- Yeah, you are.

27:55.558 --> 27:59.526
- So we'll figure it out.

27:59.528 --> 28:01.228
- How are you so sweet?

28:09.538 --> 28:11.638
- You make me that way.

28:14.176 --> 28:16.210
- Thank you.

28:18.881 --> 28:22.716
- Alright, I gotta get to work.

28:22.718 --> 28:27.788
So can we speak later when
I get off?

28:27.790 --> 28:30.524
- Maybe.

28:30.526 --> 28:33.761
- If you feel like it.

28:33.763 --> 28:35.662
- I promise I will tell you.

28:35.664 --> 28:37.865
I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm,

28:37.867 --> 28:39.299
processing.
- Processing.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.301
Processing, yeah.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.870
- Yeah.

28:42.872 --> 28:45.239
- Okay.

28:45.241 --> 28:48.976
I completely understand.

28:48.978 --> 28:51.512
- Right.

28:51.514 --> 28:53.514
- What?

28:53.516 --> 28:58.051
- Nothing, I'm just waiting
for you to flip.

29:00.122 --> 29:02.055
- Flip how?

29:02.057 --> 29:04.191
- You kind of seem too
good to be true.

29:04.193 --> 29:05.659
- [chuckles]

29:05.661 --> 29:07.761
I am definitely not.

29:07.763 --> 29:10.264
- No, I kind of think you are.

29:10.266 --> 29:13.100
Might be, uh, missing something.

29:13.102 --> 29:14.668
Let's see...

29:14.670 --> 29:16.303
- Karen, you know I'm an
open book.

29:16.305 --> 29:19.206
So...

29:19.208 --> 29:20.974
- Yeah, I know.

29:20.976 --> 29:24.478
- So how about we don't
try to make this about me?

29:24.480 --> 29:25.946
- That's not what I was
doing.

29:25.948 --> 29:28.282
- Really? 'Cause it kind of
seems like you are.

29:28.284 --> 29:32.953
- I'm just saying.
You know?

29:32.955 --> 29:35.722
Maybe...

29:35.724 --> 29:38.792
there is something somewhere.

29:41.163 --> 29:43.664
- Well, you keep waiting on
that something.

29:43.666 --> 29:46.433
- Go to work.
Go to work, okay?

29:46.435 --> 29:49.303
- Alright.

29:49.305 --> 29:51.238
I'mma call you later.

29:51.240 --> 29:55.209
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

29:55.211 --> 29:56.810
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:12.995 --> 30:18.665
- Okay, drive your car that
you paid for.

30:18.667 --> 30:21.702
Andi, drive your car that
you paid for.

30:23.172 --> 30:26.006
- [phone buzzing]

30:26.008 --> 30:27.808
- Oh, shit.

30:27.810 --> 30:29.510
I'm not in it!

30:29.512 --> 30:31.712
- Don't do it.

30:31.714 --> 30:33.514
- Are you watching me or
something?

30:33.516 --> 30:34.982
Where are you?

30:34.984 --> 30:37.684
- No, but I know you.

30:37.686 --> 30:41.388
- I'm just looking at it.
Ugh.

30:41.390 --> 30:43.423
- KAREN: Oh, okay.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.158
Well, don't do it.

30:45.160 --> 30:47.294
- I won't.

30:47.296 --> 30:50.697
- 'Cause you know that
would be him winning.

30:50.699 --> 30:54.034
- I know.
- KAREN: Okay, good.

30:54.036 --> 30:57.871
You know, I, um...
I saw him last night.

30:57.873 --> 31:02.209
- What?
- KAREN: Yeah, and Zac.

31:02.211 --> 31:05.445
- Karen, what are you
talking about?

31:05.447 --> 31:08.382
- Apparently Aaron plays
basketball with all the guys.

31:08.384 --> 31:14.121
They play for hours,
just skins and shirts.

31:14.123 --> 31:16.657
Gary and Zac, they were there.

31:16.659 --> 31:19.126
- Wait, they all know
each other?

31:19.128 --> 31:24.565
- No, no, they just play,
I guess?

31:24.567 --> 31:25.933
- Wow.

31:25.935 --> 31:28.535
- KAREN: Yeah, Gary was
playing with Zac.

31:31.407 --> 31:33.173
- How is that possible?

31:33.175 --> 31:35.876
- Well, you know, Atlanta's
such a small place.

31:35.878 --> 31:37.177
- ANDI: Ugh, right!

31:37.179 --> 31:38.979
- Especially for straight men.

31:38.981 --> 31:40.347
- Hmm.

31:40.349 --> 31:43.717
So what did he say to you?

31:43.719 --> 31:46.820
- KAREN: Who?
- Any of them!

31:46.822 --> 31:49.289
- Well, I went there
for Aaron, of course.

31:49.291 --> 31:51.725
Gary tried to talk to me,
but you know...

31:51.727 --> 31:53.594
- I know you shut that
down.

31:53.596 --> 31:55.228
- I sure did.

31:55.230 --> 31:57.097
- [laughing]

31:57.099 --> 31:59.433
So, did Zac say anything?

32:01.971 --> 32:04.204
- He didn't say much.

32:04.206 --> 32:07.374
- Hmm, okay.

32:07.376 --> 32:09.042
- So you can go ahead
and tell your friend

32:09.044 --> 32:11.745
that he ain't try to come at me.
- Don't do me like that.

32:11.747 --> 32:13.380
You know I wouldn't do
that.

32:13.382 --> 32:15.916
- Yeah, well I know you
gonna do that, so...

32:15.918 --> 32:17.517
- I wouldn't!

32:17.519 --> 32:19.886
I learned my lesson, okay?

32:19.888 --> 32:22.756
- Anyway, I need to talk
to you girls tonight.

32:22.758 --> 32:24.958
- Well, you know Danni's
pissed at you.

32:24.960 --> 32:28.295
- Okay.
Well, I need to talk to y'all.

32:28.297 --> 32:31.098
- Okay, my house?
- KAREN: Yeah.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.867
- Alright, I will call them.

32:33.869 --> 32:36.470
- Alright, see you tonight.

32:36.472 --> 32:39.106
- Is everything okay?

32:39.108 --> 32:42.075
- Yeah, I'm fine.
I just need to talk.

32:42.077 --> 32:44.511
- ANDI: Okay.
- KAREN: Alright, bye.

32:44.513 --> 32:46.346

It's uh, Zachary Taylor.

33:11.473 --> 33:13.240
I met you at the basketball
game.

33:13.242 --> 33:15.242
- Oh, hey. What's up, man?
What's going on?

33:15.244 --> 33:17.377
- Hey, what's up?
Um, you got a second?

33:17.379 --> 33:19.312
- Yeah, just at work.
What's up?

33:19.314 --> 33:23.717
- Um, a couple weeks ago,
I invested like 19k

33:23.719 --> 33:27.421
into a stock and it hit.

33:27.423 --> 33:30.891
So right now it's about at
like 1.5.

33:30.893 --> 33:33.060
- Damn!
- ZAC: Yeah, it's crazy.

33:33.062 --> 33:34.661
- What stock was this?

33:34.663 --> 33:36.697
- Um, Bellanista.

33:36.699 --> 33:38.899
- Bellanista.

Okay, man, that's a...

You a lucky dog.

33:45.708 --> 33:48.775
- ZAC: Thanks.
- Yeah, um...

33:48.777 --> 33:52.345
How'd you know to buy
that stock?

33:52.347 --> 33:55.982
- I, I didn't know to buy it.

33:55.984 --> 33:57.918
This is my first time and

33:57.920 --> 34:00.053
I was guessing
and I just hit.

34:00.055 --> 34:01.955
I guess I'm just lucky,
like you say.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.624
- GARY: I'll say.
- Yeah, well, anyway.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.494
Recently I've been reading
a bunch of different stuff

34:07.496 --> 34:11.331
and I hear people saying
that the stock may tank

34:11.333 --> 34:14.401
and I'm not sure if I should
leave it in or take it out.

34:14.403 --> 34:16.269
What you think?
- I don't know, man.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.171
I think it still has some legs
on it.

34:18.173 --> 34:19.639
- ZAC: Really?
- Yeah.

34:19.641 --> 34:24.845
Hey listen, you can sell if
you don't think it may.

34:24.847 --> 34:27.347
- But if I sell it, then I can
miss out

34:27.349 --> 34:30.851
on, like, a whole bunch of
money, right?

34:30.853 --> 34:32.319
- How about this?

34:32.321 --> 34:34.421
I'll have my guy Jake look
at it for you

34:34.423 --> 34:36.590
and have him give you a call.

34:36.592 --> 34:38.492
