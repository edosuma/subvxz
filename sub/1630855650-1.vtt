WEBVTT

01:06.631 --> 01:08.111
<i> Magic.</i>

01:08.111 --> 01:09.808
<i>It has been a part
of my son's life</i>

01:09.808 --> 01:11.897
<i>for as long as I can remember.</i>

01:11.897 --> 01:15.292
<i>I swear, he just could never
get enough of that stuff.</i>

01:15.292 --> 01:17.729
<i>He was always setting
shit on fire,</i>

01:17.729 --> 01:19.166
<i>cutting things in half.</i>

01:19.166 --> 01:22.604
<i>When he was ten, he had
my tired ass driving him</i>

01:22.604 --> 01:24.432
<i>to every novelty shop
and garage sale</i>

01:24.432 --> 01:26.086
<i>to find whatever
little thingamajig</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:28.392
<i>that he could use for a trick.</i>

01:28.392 --> 01:31.047
<i>He even had me buy him
a damn rabbit.</i>

01:31.047 --> 01:33.397
<i>Where I come from, we eat them.</i>

01:33.397 --> 01:35.747
<i>Can anyone say rabbit stew?</i>

01:35.747 --> 01:37.053
<i>When he was 15,</i>

01:37.053 --> 01:38.750
<i>he decided
to become a magician.</i>

01:38.750 --> 01:41.405
<i>'Cause there's only two things
in life he's crazy about.</i>

01:41.405 --> 01:44.147
<i>One is magic and
the other, Robin.</i>

01:45.148 --> 01:47.237
Presto!

01:47.237 --> 01:48.543
Stop messing around, Merlin.

01:48.543 --> 01:50.110
I'm not messing around.
I'm stuck.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.894
Can you help me out, please?
The key's beside Poof.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.156
Just here, over there.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.549
Why do trick handcuffs
need a key?

01:54.549 --> 01:56.812
Ouch! Okay, okay,
I got it. Okay.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.118
You better figure it out.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.337
You don't want to blow it
in the show.

02:01.295 --> 02:02.644
I'm so not ready for this.

02:02.644 --> 02:03.862
Don't say that.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.734
You've wanted this
since we were kids.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.518
You always said one day
you'd performed in Vegas.

02:07.518 --> 02:08.867
Okay. Let's see.

02:10.652 --> 02:12.958
Am I ready for this?

02:15.700 --> 02:16.788
I guess you're right.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.182
This really never does lie.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.141
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.054
Let me check.

02:23.404 --> 02:25.536
Will Robin marry Merlin one day?

02:26.929 --> 02:29.410
Okay, no, no. Okay, I doubt
that that will happen now

02:29.410 --> 02:30.715
because you're literally
going away to college.

02:30.715 --> 02:33.065
Julliard is not just college.

02:33.065 --> 02:35.633
If I'm going to be a dancer,
it's where I need to be.

02:35.633 --> 02:37.244
The only time I'll see you
is what?

02:37.244 --> 02:38.636
Holidays and summer breaks.

02:38.636 --> 02:39.637
You'll forget about me.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.468
You just... You just...

02:44.468 --> 02:46.601
You just...
You put your lips on my...

02:46.601 --> 02:48.080
Why'd you do that?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.647
I could never forget you, Merlin.

02:50.648 --> 02:52.302
Now you got something good
to think about.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.783
And try not to lose
that key again.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.219
Wait. You got...

02:56.219 --> 02:57.568
You got something on your...

02:57.568 --> 02:58.961
on your...
on your...

03:01.790 --> 03:03.313
How did you do that?

03:04.749 --> 03:06.229
Hope you're ready, Merlin.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.535
Time to go.
- That's my mom! Go!

03:07.535 --> 03:08.927
You gotta hide.
You know how she is.

03:08.927 --> 03:10.277
She's crazy.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.930
Whatchu doing, Son?

03:11.930 --> 03:14.324
Lord, I hope you ain't in there
jerking your johnson.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.325
No!

03:15.325 --> 03:16.761
Come on. We'll be late.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.720
We got... I don't
want to be late.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.244
What?

03:21.244 --> 03:22.811
What is that?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.682
Robin, is that you
on your knees over there?

03:24.682 --> 03:25.509
Get up!

03:25.509 --> 03:27.903
Hi...
Yes, ma'am.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.732
Your little narrow ass hiding
behind the bed. What the hell?

03:30.732 --> 03:31.994
How did you know?

03:31.994 --> 03:33.561
'Cause it smells like
Now and Laters

03:33.561 --> 03:34.866
and ProStyle in here.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.172
Smell like hood rat pudding.

03:36.172 --> 03:38.174
I mean, we weren't doing
nothing. I swear.

03:38.174 --> 03:39.523
Oh, honey, I know.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.482
He wouldn't know what to do
with a girl anyways,

03:41.482 --> 03:43.092
unless she was in a catalog.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.268
Victoria may have its secrets,

03:45.268 --> 03:47.879
but Merlin, he ain't got none.

03:47.879 --> 03:49.664
- Mom!
- Now, look, we got to go.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.535
- Okay.
- I don't want to be late.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.102
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

03:54.190 --> 03:55.974
What's that she said
about jerking?

03:55.974 --> 03:58.107
Get your little
fresh ass out of my house!

03:58.107 --> 03:59.456
You gotta go.
You gotta go.

04:00.631 --> 04:02.503
<i> See,
everywhere Merlin went,</i>

04:02.503 --> 04:03.765
<i>Robin went too.</i>

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
<i>They were ride or die
from day one.</i>

04:05.245 --> 04:07.943
<i>So when my son decided
to enter the talent show,</i>

04:07.943 --> 04:10.815
<i>there was no doubt who
his assistant would be.</i>

04:10.815 --> 04:13.514
Just try to relax, Merlin.
Nothing to worry about.

04:13.514 --> 04:14.993
Except the routine.

04:14.993 --> 04:16.821
- Routine. The routine.
- Yeah.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.432
The routine...
The routine!

04:18.432 --> 04:21.304
Oh, I forgot my extra boxers
for the endless ribbon trick.

04:21.304 --> 04:23.698
And that's a whole punch line.
- Okay. Wait. Wait.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.569
How about you just use
the ones that you have on?

04:25.569 --> 04:27.223
No one will be able
to tell the difference.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.616
- You really don't think so?
- No.

04:28.616 --> 04:30.574
You're all set.
And you guys are going on last

04:30.574 --> 04:32.228
because you had
the best audition.

04:32.228 --> 04:33.534
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:33.534 --> 04:34.578
Best audition?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.188
Must be talking about us, right?

04:36.188 --> 04:38.147
Ghetto Gangstas in da house!

04:38.147 --> 04:40.454
We ain't just rappers.
We gangstas!

04:40.454 --> 04:43.152
Alright, we about that life.
We come from the streets.

04:43.152 --> 04:46.198
The streets of Beverly Hills.
That's what it must be.

04:46.198 --> 04:48.331
Because there's no ghetto
gangsters here honestly.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.246
You guys are straight
out of the cul-de-sac.

04:50.246 --> 04:52.161
Wait a second.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:52.161 --> 04:54.729
That's definitely Armani.
- Is that Armani?

04:54.729 --> 04:56.383
Yeah, my dad has the same... yes.

04:56.383 --> 04:57.732
Ah, y'all got tricks!

04:57.732 --> 04:59.690
Man, we oughta smoke
this fake-ass clown!

04:59.690 --> 05:03.172
I'm not a clown.
Okay, I'm a magician.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.174
And you ain't smoking nobody, honey.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.307
Oh, whatchu gonna do
about it, old lady?

05:07.307 --> 05:09.961
Pour some hot coffee on me?
Bitch, please.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.049
Oh!

05:11.049 --> 05:13.182
Oh well, since you asked nicely.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.358
Sit your ass down somewhere!

05:15.358 --> 05:17.273
Talking to me crazy like that.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.753
Y'all, come on. Go on.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.363
Look here, baby.

05:20.363 --> 05:22.278
You forget about them dumbasses, okay?

05:22.278 --> 05:25.107
You either go big
or you go home, Merlin.

05:25.107 --> 05:26.848
Got that?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.415
- Go knock them out.
- I got you.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.590
All right.

05:29.590 --> 05:31.374
Y'all thirsty?
Hmm?

05:31.374 --> 05:33.420
You obviously like
your coffee black.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.423
Behold, just an ordinary
deck of cards.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.512
Now, watch closely,
very intently.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.991
That's my baby.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.558
This is gonna be
the most remarkable thing

05:41.558 --> 05:42.994
you've ever seen
in your entire life.

05:42.994 --> 05:45.649
Now, I can make them turn
into something

05:45.649 --> 05:47.477
that's kind of big, like that.

05:48.565 --> 05:49.827
Whoa!

05:49.827 --> 05:51.568
There's no way he's gonna win.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.224
<i> And with Robin
by his side on that stage,</i>

05:55.224 --> 05:56.573
<i>he finally found his passion.</i>

05:58.053 --> 05:59.968
Oh! Oh my God!

06:01.143 --> 06:03.841
<i>I was so proud of him,
I damn near pissed myself.</i>

06:03.841 --> 06:06.975
<i>Okay, I did, but I had an extra
pair of panties in my purse.</i>

06:09.238 --> 06:13.677
<i>Anyway, he had everyone inside
that gym feeling the magic,</i>

06:13.677 --> 06:16.114
<i>except for a few stupid
ass haters.</i>

06:16.114 --> 06:21.076
For my last trick, I will be
escaping these handcuffs here

06:21.076 --> 06:23.252
before this candle
burns this rope

06:23.252 --> 06:26.603
and drops this water balloon
over my amazing assistant.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.649
As you guys can see,
she is a black woman

06:28.649 --> 06:29.954
who just got her hair done.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.869
So if I screw this up,
I'm screwed.

06:33.218 --> 06:36.657
Alrighty, let's get this show
on the road.

06:39.573 --> 06:41.357
And... we're lit.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.533
Can you guys actually help me

06:43.533 --> 06:44.839
get this on?
- Yeah.

06:44.839 --> 06:46.231
Give it up for
the Ghetto Gangsters.

06:46.231 --> 06:47.711
They from the streets.
They know what's going on.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.713
They know about some handcuffs.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.063
It's on there, right?
It's on there.

06:52.063 --> 06:52.977
Oh, it's on there.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.239
So I know what y'all thinking.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.981
These are impossible
to get out of.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.592
I guarantee, he ain't
getting out of that.

06:58.592 --> 07:03.684
But that is why they call me
the Amazing Merlin!

07:04.902 --> 07:08.253
And, oh, presto!

07:10.168 --> 07:12.301
Presto! Prest...

07:12.780 --> 07:14.651
Presto.
- Merlin!

07:14.651 --> 07:15.826
<i> Them fools
was so salty</i>

07:15.826 --> 07:17.480
<i>about losing to a magician,</i>

07:17.480 --> 07:20.483
<i>they decided to let
the rabbit out of the hat.</i>

07:23.399 --> 07:26.707
<i>Except for my son,
it was more like a snake.</i>

07:26.707 --> 07:29.274
<i>It's a good thing
Robin had her blindfold on</i>

07:29.274 --> 07:31.799
<i>because some tricks
ain't for kids.</i>

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
Oh, Lord have mercy!

07:33.627 --> 07:36.630
That boy is blessed!

07:37.108 --> 07:39.154
Merlin!
- What do you want, Robin?

07:39.154 --> 07:40.982
- What's going on?
- I have a situation.

07:40.982 --> 07:42.113
I literally have a situation.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.375
Y'all stop!

07:43.767 --> 07:45.116
Oh my God!

07:45.116 --> 07:47.641
That's a freak show, man.
Not a magic show.

07:47.641 --> 07:48.685
It's a clown.

07:48.685 --> 07:52.123
I told you, I am not a clown!

07:53.821 --> 07:56.171
Really? You need
to tell your face!

07:56.171 --> 07:58.042
Very funny, little girl.

07:58.042 --> 08:01.481
But I can assure you all,
I am not a clown.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.700
I'm a magician. Now watch.

08:03.700 --> 08:04.962
You see this ball here?

08:04.962 --> 08:06.921
Alright, so I'm gonna put it
in this hand.

08:06.921 --> 08:10.707
Where'd it go?
Where did the ball go?

08:14.058 --> 08:15.843
Yeah, yeah, thank you!

08:16.844 --> 08:19.063
It's in the other hand, dummy!

08:19.063 --> 08:22.327
Now, shut up and
make a balloon animal.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.418
A orangutan basically
snuck me.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.290
Do you guys know about
me and orangutan?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.510
No? Baby, you ever talk
about me and orangutan?

08:31.249 --> 08:32.381
Turn her on.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.991
Haha, stupid clown.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.253
Stupid?

08:36.211 --> 08:37.386
Why would you...

08:37.386 --> 08:38.779
So, when he get me
in the chokehold,

08:38.779 --> 08:40.084
I can't breathe.

08:40.084 --> 08:41.999
I basically took
the orangutan here, right?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.261
Dropped down this left leg.

08:44.698 --> 08:46.569
Right? I drop it down.
Took that like that.

08:47.483 --> 08:48.571
When I dropped to here,

08:48.571 --> 08:49.441
I pivoted.

08:50.051 --> 08:52.662
Orangutan on his back.
I showed him mercy.

08:52.662 --> 08:54.534
Orangutan obviously
didn't want no more.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.144
You guys do know I'm...
What is it?

08:56.144 --> 08:57.841
Second degree black belt, baby?
Second degree.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.462
You got to be kidding me.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.681
Hey, man.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.815
Get yo ass down!
Get down off of that, man!

09:14.815 --> 09:16.251
What are you doing?

09:16.251 --> 09:18.166
- The wig is...
- I don't want to hear it.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.472
Tell me, who did I hire?
'Cause you must be confused.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.692
Did I hire Trixie the Clown
or Dixie the Clown?

09:22.692 --> 09:24.520
'Cause right now you got
your dick all on display.

09:24.520 --> 09:26.130
I'm not actually a clown.
I'm a magician.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.480
Okay. Let me try to find
some give a fuck.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.699
'Cause I don't care.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.701
I don't care what you are
or who you are.

09:31.701 --> 09:33.616
All this flipping and flopping

09:33.616 --> 09:36.053
and your goddamn elephant trunk acting.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.577
You can't do that here, man.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.969
If I wanted my daughter
to see that,

09:38.969 --> 09:40.188
I'll take her to the zoo.

09:40.188 --> 09:42.103
But instead she got
to look at this now.

09:42.103 --> 09:43.539
Now I turn around, she crying.

09:43.539 --> 09:45.236
Now you got my sweet daughter crying.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.151
She's actually not that sweet.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.110
- What? Boy...

09:49.110 --> 09:51.765
If I take off this watch,
you gonna know it's time.

09:51.765 --> 09:53.549
Time to whoop your ass.
Is that what you want?

09:53.549 --> 09:55.551
- No, I don't...
- You want it off?

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
Alright, brother,
I really apologize.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.249
But I mean,
you know how it is.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.686
I mean,
it's not a big deal, right?

09:59.686 --> 10:02.558
We all got one. Right?

10:02.558 --> 10:03.820
That's your shot at me?

10:04.255 --> 10:05.605
Hmm?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.171
That's a shot at me and
my personal situation?

10:07.171 --> 10:11.349
We don't all have one, brother.
Some of us got skipped.

10:11.349 --> 10:14.918
Me, my dad, Earl, Rob.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.180
None of us have it.

10:16.180 --> 10:18.052
If I had one, you think
I'd be in his house?

10:18.052 --> 10:19.880
You think I spent this type
of money on a house

10:19.880 --> 10:21.664
for my goddamn wife?
A Tesla?

10:21.664 --> 10:24.014
If I had a dick that big,
you think I'd have to do this?

10:24.014 --> 10:25.712
I'm obviously overcompensating.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.365
So this little thing that
you're talking about,

10:27.365 --> 10:28.323
that you bragging about,

10:28.323 --> 10:30.325
it's something that you have.

10:30.325 --> 10:32.936
With that being said,
you're done. You're done.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.112
Get your ass up out of here.
- I really need this gig.

10:35.112 --> 10:37.941
I said get up out of here!
Now! It's coming off.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.640
Get your dick dragging ass
up out of here.

10:41.379 --> 10:42.859
Honey, if you don't pick
your eyes up,

10:42.859 --> 10:44.600
I'll put them down.
God damn!

10:45.166 --> 10:46.297
<i> I'm done with this.</i>

10:46.297 --> 10:47.559
<i>Time to hang up
my bag of tricks.</i>

10:47.559 --> 10:49.866
What? You can't quit.

10:49.866 --> 10:52.260
I thought you were gonna
take the act to Vegas.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.697
Does it look like
I'm ready for Vegas?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.090
Look at me, man.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.136
God, it's just time
to give up on the dream.

11:00.355 --> 11:02.313
Bubbles, FX, do you mind?
Like I'm serious. Okay?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.576
Ever since I was a kid, there's
only one thing in this world

11:04.576 --> 11:05.969
I love more than magic.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.580
And her plane is landing
right now.

11:11.192 --> 11:13.716
So I'm gonna go clean up

11:13.716 --> 11:15.370
and I'm gonna tell her
how I feel.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.720
Alright. Alright.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.984
Ladies and gentlemen, sounds
like we got true love here.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.334
Alright. Alright.

11:23.334 --> 11:26.773
Let's get Trixie
to go see his girl!

11:28.992 --> 11:31.429
Go on. Pick all this stuff up.
Close the door. Let's go.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.562
<i> So Merlin was ready
to give up one passion</i>

11:33.562 --> 11:35.433
<i>to chase after another one.</i>

11:35.433 --> 11:37.174
<i>And after not seeing Robin
in years,</i>

11:37.174 --> 11:39.611
<i>he finally planned
to speak his truth.</i>

11:39.611 --> 11:41.309
<i>Funny thing about plans.</i>

11:41.309 --> 11:43.354
<i>They don't always go
as planned.</i>

11:43.354 --> 11:46.183
<i>Just like I never planned
on being pregnant at 23,</i>

11:46.183 --> 11:48.098
<i>but I'm allergic
to condoms, y'all.</i>

11:49.143 --> 11:50.710
Okay. I'm gonna get out.
I'm gonna change.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.102
Okay. Alright. Alright.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.364
I'll be right back.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.844
I just gotta get something
out of the car.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.281
- Robin?
- Merlin?

11:57.281 --> 11:58.326
Is that you?

11:58.326 --> 12:00.023
Do you still believe
in magic?

12:00.676 --> 12:02.069
Oh my God!

12:02.069 --> 12:03.984
Oh my God! I was trying
to surprise you,

12:03.984 --> 12:05.420
but you beat me here!

12:05.420 --> 12:06.769
I was going to change but, yo,

12:06.769 --> 12:07.988
I got something big to tell you.

12:07.988 --> 12:10.773
Well, I have
a big surprise too.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.427
What's up, babe? Oh.

12:12.427 --> 12:13.384
Oh.

12:13.384 --> 12:14.864
Who's this clown?

12:15.386 --> 12:17.258
Don't let the clown makeup
fool you.

12:17.258 --> 12:19.173
I'm a serious magician.
Not a clown.

12:19.173 --> 12:21.305
You having trouble
over there, Trix?

12:24.221 --> 12:25.527
Um...

12:25.527 --> 12:27.877
I don't know them.
- Oh. Yeah.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.618
Anyways, I'm a Merlin.

12:29.618 --> 12:31.272
Grew up with Robin.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.230
She'd been my girl
since back in the day.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.929
Oh, well, I'm Blaze.

12:35.929 --> 12:37.800
And while you were
at circus school,

12:37.800 --> 12:42.326
Robin got a new boyfriend.
So she's kind of my girl now.

12:42.326 --> 12:43.980
Surprise!

12:43.980 --> 12:45.025
Hold still.

12:49.812 --> 12:51.640
Can I get everybody's
attention?

12:51.640 --> 12:54.382
Thank you everyone so much
for coming out to see me

12:54.382 --> 12:55.687
and meet Blaze.

12:56.340 --> 12:59.430
Though some of you know him
already from his viral videos.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.564
"You just got blazed!"

13:03.304 --> 13:05.436
And now I can finally
share the secret

13:05.436 --> 13:07.482
of why I've come back to LA.

13:07.482 --> 13:10.050
I'm a mentor dancer
on Hollywood and Grind.

13:12.487 --> 13:14.532
We're so excited. It's a black
Dancing with the Stars.

13:14.532 --> 13:16.926
And Blaze is my celebrity
dance partner.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.234
Please, everybody
go vote for us.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.933
Hi, Verna. How are you?
- Excuse me?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.108
- Miss Owen.
- Thank you.

13:25.108 --> 13:26.675
Hope you're doing great.

13:26.675 --> 13:29.852
You still smell like Now and
Laters and ProStyle, huh?

13:31.245 --> 13:32.202
Hey, girl!

13:32.855 --> 13:34.726
- Hey!
- Wow, he looks amazing.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.555
See, I told you
everyone would love him.

13:37.555 --> 13:39.035
You really hit the jackpot.

13:39.035 --> 13:43.083
First with the great job
and then the hot boyfriend.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.607
Yeah, all 'cause my friend
took me to her audition.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.174
- Yeah.
- I still can't believe this.

13:47.174 --> 13:48.958
Yeah, you and me both. Yeah.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.831
Remind me why I did that again?
It was crazy.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.006
You know I'm just
playing with you.

13:54.224 --> 13:57.967
Anyway, he's really
fine and funny.

13:57.967 --> 13:59.534
And making bank.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.883
Who wouldn't love that?

14:00.883 --> 14:02.232
Well...

14:03.233 --> 14:04.495
I can think of one person.

14:05.496 --> 14:07.150
That old Humpty Dumpty
over there?

14:07.150 --> 14:10.545
Okay, forget the nerdy neighbor
and go dance with your star.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.113
Okay, because if you don't,
I will.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.377
Okay. I'm gonna go talk
to Merlin.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.508
Yeah. Okay.

14:17.987 --> 14:20.250
Hey, everybody. Y'all okay?

14:20.250 --> 14:22.165
Hey!
- Hey!

14:22.165 --> 14:24.907
Oh my God,
what a wonderful surprise!

14:24.907 --> 14:27.649
Sorry, I didn't tell you
about the show, Merlin.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.781
But they wanted me
to keep it a secret.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.653
You know, spending all
that time with Blaze,

14:31.653 --> 14:33.437
rehearsing and dancing closely,

14:33.437 --> 14:36.484
sometimes stuff
just sort of happens.

14:36.484 --> 14:39.095
Yeah, I just don't get
what you see in him.

14:39.095 --> 14:41.141
All his jokes are put downs
and insults.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.794
I've seen his videos.

14:42.794 --> 14:44.535
- That's just an act.
- Really?

14:44.535 --> 14:46.407
Well, he's not that good
an actor.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.191
Wow.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.891
Alright. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that, okay?

14:51.891 --> 14:55.198
And I never even told you that
I was proud of you for the show.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.765
That's so amazing. Like...

14:56.765 --> 14:58.941
I couldn't imagine dancing
in front of all those folks.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.247
You never know.

15:00.638 --> 15:02.640
Yo, look who it is!

15:02.640 --> 15:03.815
It's the magic man.

15:03.815 --> 15:04.947
It's magic. He's goofy.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.036
Hey. Doesn't he look goofy?

15:07.036 --> 15:09.038
I bet you when you take the
rabbit out your hat,

15:09.038 --> 15:10.257
the rabbit's like,
"Put me back in!"

15:10.257 --> 15:11.780
- Stop. Blaze.
- I'm just clowning.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.521
Nah, I'm gonna stop.
I'm not gonna clown you anymore

15:13.521 --> 15:15.218
because you already clowned yourself.

15:15.218 --> 15:16.611
Guys, look at this picture.
- Stop!

15:16.611 --> 15:18.482
- Do you see it?
- Stop.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.919
Blaze. Blaze. Stop.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.050
Okay.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.965
Merlin is so much
more than that.

15:22.965 --> 15:24.967
What was that big news you were
gonna tell me out front?

15:24.967 --> 15:26.577
Yeah, yeah, drop that scoop, Brodini.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.188
I'm going to Vegas
for a magic gig.

15:28.579 --> 15:30.538
- Las Vegas?

15:30.538 --> 15:32.061
Merlin, that's terrific!

15:32.061 --> 15:34.194
Oh my God,
this is so unbelievable!

15:34.585 --> 15:36.065
So much to celebrate.
- Yeah.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.111
- Who wants to see us dance?
- Yeah, let's dance.

15:38.111 --> 15:39.590
Come on, let's make
some space, everybody.

15:39.590 --> 15:41.114
You're gonna want to see this.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.421
<i> Now, I knew
my boy was lying.</i>

15:44.421 --> 15:47.816
<i>But I also knew that every lie
hides a little truth.</i>

15:50.993 --> 15:52.603
Why are they cheering?
Is it over?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.431
No. It's only just beginning.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.911
What are you doing?

15:56.825 --> 15:58.000
Oh my God.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.393
I just want to keep dancing, baby.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.919
So with your family watching,
all your friends watching

16:03.919 --> 16:05.181
and these cameras watching,

16:05.181 --> 16:06.661
I want to know;

16:06.661 --> 16:07.662
will you marry me?

16:07.662 --> 16:09.577
- What?
- Yeah?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.276
Okay. Okay, yes!

16:14.016 --> 16:16.584
<i> And I knew the truth
was if he lost Robin,</i>

16:16.584 --> 16:20.414
<i>he'd have to find a way
to get the magic back.</i>

16:20.414 --> 16:23.286
<i>The Amazing Merlin!</i>

16:24.461 --> 16:25.375
<i>And presto!</i>

16:26.681 --> 16:28.770
Is it too late for me and Robin?

16:43.132 --> 16:45.047
I figured you'd be here.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.267
Back where it all started.

16:47.658 --> 16:50.139
My baby's first performance.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.446
I'll never forget it.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.752
That day didn't end well
for me.

16:55.623 --> 16:56.624
No.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.930
You got a chance to do it over.

16:59.757 --> 17:01.063
You know, mom, it's fine.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.284
Okay, don't worry about me.
It's cool.

17:04.849 --> 17:08.027
Boy, I'm worried about me.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.680
When you moving out?

17:09.680 --> 17:11.334
You 24 years old.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.729
I am tired of sneaking men in
late at night.

17:14.729 --> 17:17.210
The last one I had there
was so loud,

17:17.210 --> 17:19.386
when I let him come
in my back door,

17:19.386 --> 17:20.909
I was scared he was gonna
wake you up.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.432
We ain't got no back door.

17:22.432 --> 17:23.390
Hmm!

17:26.132 --> 17:28.917
Anyways, it's time
for you to move on.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.572
Okay? Follow your dreams.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.487
Okay, no, I get that.
But if I leave,

17:33.487 --> 17:34.879
Robin will forget all about me.

17:34.879 --> 17:37.273
And I've always imagined us
being together.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.970
Boy, I always thought
me and your daddy

17:38.970 --> 17:41.060
would end up being together.
But ta-da!

17:41.060 --> 17:43.018
That didn't happen.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.933
Look.

17:45.716 --> 17:49.068
I opened up my Expedia app

17:49.068 --> 17:51.635
and I got you something
you needed.

17:53.681 --> 17:55.683
Wait, seriously?
That's...

17:55.683 --> 17:57.511
Mom, thanks, but it's
a one-way ticket though.

17:57.511 --> 17:59.687
Exactly.
'Cause there's only one way

17:59.687 --> 18:01.210
you're going to do this, Merlin.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.385
Your way.

18:02.385 --> 18:03.995
<i>So he made his flight</i>

18:03.995 --> 18:06.128
<i>and I made his room
into a rec room.</i>

18:06.128 --> 18:08.130
<i>'Cause Lord knows
I had a few men</i>

18:08.130 --> 18:09.305
<i>I've been waiting to wreck.</i>

18:09.871 --> 18:13.831
<i>Meanwhile, I told Merlin to go
find Rita at the Hotel Moxie.</i>

18:13.831 --> 18:15.355
Hey, are you sure
this is Hotel Moxie?

18:15.355 --> 18:16.791
This place is supposed
to be history.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.141
It is. Ancient history.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.370
<i> Rita is my homegirl</i>

18:30.370 --> 18:32.372
<i>from back when I used
to work in Vegas</i>

18:32.372 --> 18:33.721
<i>inside The Cookie Club.</i>

18:33.721 --> 18:35.679
<i>The hottest spot on the strip.</i>

18:35.679 --> 18:38.943
<i>Sadly, it has seen better days
and so had Rita.</i>

18:38.943 --> 18:43.339
Only way I leave here is
with a fat check or a pine box.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.819
You can tell those vultures

18:44.819 --> 18:47.648
they can kiss
Rita's big white juicy ass.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.312
For my glaucoma.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.010
Welcome to the Vagrant Inn,
Las Vegas.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.185
How many nights you need?

19:03.968 --> 19:05.579
You know,
I'm actually not sure

19:05.579 --> 19:06.710
how long I'll be here.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.886
Well, that makes
two of us, honey.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.628
Well, I'm Jason Owens,

19:11.628 --> 19:13.717
but everybody
just calls me Merlin.

19:15.676 --> 19:16.894
I'm Verna's son.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.635
I guess she used
to work for you years ago.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.463
I'll be damned!

19:20.463 --> 19:24.119
She was one terrific lady
and a great waitress.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.990
She stood by me through
some tough times

19:25.990 --> 19:26.904
after my daddy passed.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.995
If you are Verna's child,

19:30.995 --> 19:32.867
I got a room for you

19:32.867 --> 19:34.608
and it overlooks the pool.

19:35.478 --> 19:36.784
It ain't much to look at now,

19:36.784 --> 19:38.568
but once upon a time,
it sure was something.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.048
This was my daddy's pride
and joy

19:40.048 --> 19:41.963
and I ran it
for a good 28 years.

19:41.963 --> 19:45.053
Billionaire owners are trying
to just take Rita's ass

19:45.053 --> 19:46.402
for less to nothing.

19:46.402 --> 19:48.187
Motherfucker bloodsuckers.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.754
But we do have happy hour
every day at six

19:50.754 --> 19:52.452
in the Cookie Club out back.

19:56.238 --> 19:57.935
It's not called
the Hotel Moxie anymore.

19:57.935 --> 20:00.808
It's called The Vagina?

20:01.330 --> 20:02.375
Wait, that's...

20:02.375 --> 20:03.767
<i> That sounds cozy.</i>

20:03.767 --> 20:05.856
Is it moist in there?

20:05.856 --> 20:07.249
Okay, Mama, don't.

20:07.249 --> 20:08.816
Are the people there nice,

20:08.816 --> 20:10.426
or is it mostly dicks?

20:10.426 --> 20:11.906
<i>You tell me.</i>

20:11.906 --> 20:13.429
Does it smell funny in there?

20:13.429 --> 20:14.909
<i>Mom! Really?</i>

20:14.909 --> 20:16.824
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

20:16.824 --> 20:18.217
That was a little too much.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.522
Yeah, whatever. I mean,

20:19.522 --> 20:20.697
I got some auditions tomorrow,

20:20.697 --> 20:22.264
which is kind of cool,

20:22.264 --> 20:25.267
but I don't know.
I feel like I'm wasting my time.

20:25.267 --> 20:27.704
<i>Boy, you been wanting this
since you was in diapers,</i>

20:27.704 --> 20:30.098
watching Merlin the Magician cartoons.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.318
Now I know you was
full of shit then.

20:32.318 --> 20:35.408
You have to ask yourself;
are you full of shit now?

20:35.408 --> 20:36.539
You right.

20:37.497 --> 20:39.150
It's now or never.

20:39.150 --> 20:42.328
Now, never call me with
this bullshit again.

20:43.546 --> 20:45.548
You ready for round two?
- Uhn-uhn! Uhn-uhn!

20:45.548 --> 20:47.507
Oh, no, you ready
for round two.

20:47.507 --> 20:50.771
Stop crying! Stop crying!
Shut up.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.689
This is my first audition.
I'm really excited.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.824
Just get right into it then.

21:08.049 --> 21:09.833
<i> So Merlin took
his first step</i>

21:09.833 --> 21:12.967
<i>to becoming a real
Las Vegas magician.</i>

21:12.967 --> 21:15.491
<i>Unfortunately,
his first audition</i>

21:15.491 --> 21:17.319
<i>kind of was like
the first time I had sex.</i>

21:17.319 --> 21:18.538
<i>Y'all know what I mean.</i>

21:18.538 --> 21:21.454
<i>Awkward, messy,
a little painful.</i>

21:21.454 --> 21:24.892
<i>And for some reason,
there was glitter in my ass.</i>

21:24.892 --> 21:26.589
<i>But I digress.</i>

21:30.724 --> 21:32.856
<i>And just like bad sex,</i>

21:32.856 --> 21:36.164
<i>the only way to get good at it
is to keep trying</i>

21:36.164 --> 21:38.297
<i>and trying and trying.</i>

21:38.993 --> 21:42.344
<i>And Merlin, well,
he wasn't ready to give up yet.</i>

21:49.090 --> 21:51.571
No, no! Shit!

21:52.441 --> 21:54.008
Jesus.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.452
Oh...

22:03.452 --> 22:05.062
It's for my arthritis.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.890
- Don't you mean glaucoma?

22:06.890 --> 22:08.239
What, are you my doctor now?

22:08.239 --> 22:09.502
No, but...

22:09.502 --> 22:11.242
You're a little early
for happy hour.

22:11.242 --> 22:13.375
Yeah, well, I just bombed
my audition,

22:13.375 --> 22:16.247
so it's gonna take a lot longer
than an hour to get me happy.

22:16.247 --> 22:17.771
Yeah, well, you ain't
the only one unhappy.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.468
Look at this.
It's my busiest night

22:19.468 --> 22:21.644
and this damn karaoke machine
broke down.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.429
Can I get you anything?

22:24.212 --> 22:26.867
Yeah. Uh, what's the hardest
stuff you got?

22:26.867 --> 22:28.738
My private stash.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.393
I get it from the local Paiutes.
It's straight firewater.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.048
- Okay.
- You ain't ready for that.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.355
But we do have some
Crown Royal apple.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.399
How about that?

22:37.399 --> 22:39.270
- Crown Royal apple.
- Oh, yeah.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.490
Miss Rita, I am kind
of tight for money.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.666
So you know,
I got a deck of cards,

22:43.666 --> 22:45.799
so how about you draw for it?

22:45.799 --> 22:47.888
But if you win, I owe you.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.412
But if I win, you owe me.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.936
So pick a card, Miss Rita.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.418
- This is so dumb.
- Hmm!

22:56.418 --> 22:57.985
That's a good card.
I know it is.

22:57.985 --> 23:00.204
I know it is a good card.
Oh, I can't look at it.

23:00.204 --> 23:02.076
I can't look at it.
- No, you cannot look it.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.034
Go ahead. Put that thing back
in the deck. Anywhere.

23:04.034 --> 23:05.427
That is beautiful, Miss Rita.

23:06.428 --> 23:07.908
That's so good, Miss Rita.

23:07.908 --> 23:09.344
That's so lovely.

23:09.344 --> 23:11.346
Okay.
- Testing. Testing.

23:11.346 --> 23:12.869
Was this your card?

23:12.869 --> 23:15.394
This had to be your card, right?
- No, it's not my card.

23:16.743 --> 23:18.440
All right, um...

23:18.440 --> 23:19.920
Was that your card?
This had to have been.

23:19.920 --> 23:22.139
No. I don't have time
for this.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.185
I have a whole group
of single ladies coming in.

23:24.185 --> 23:25.534
It's their busiest night
in town.

23:25.534 --> 23:28.624
And with no karaoke to keep
them eating my wings

23:28.624 --> 23:30.452
and drinking my liquor...
- Yeah.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.149
...what am I gonna do
for entertainment?

23:32.149 --> 23:34.456
Will you stop playing?
I need to make some dough, kid.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.763
Have any ideas? What?

23:36.763 --> 23:38.460
Jesus, what is that?

23:38.460 --> 23:41.202
That's your card, right?
That's your card, right?

23:42.899 --> 23:44.640
Wow.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.642
<i>These ladies ain't
the magic show type.</i>

23:46.642 --> 23:48.992
But if you keep the bar flowing,
I'll pay you 50 bucks.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.473
Cool. This is a nice place
you got here.

23:51.473 --> 23:54.694
Nice place?
The Cookie Club was famous.

23:54.694 --> 23:57.653
We used to pack the house.
Believe it. Once upon a time,

23:57.653 --> 24:00.221
we had the finest male
dancing troupe in town.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.527
The Chocolate Chips.

24:01.527 --> 24:04.225
Look, Mr. Face, Mr. Body,

24:04.225 --> 24:06.749
Mr. Slim Sexy, Dr. X.

24:06.749 --> 24:09.360
And the one and only Mr. Big.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.884
It was a goddamn goldmine.

24:10.884 --> 24:12.581
So what happened?
Why'd it stop?

24:12.581 --> 24:16.324
Egos. Too much success.
They argued all the time.

24:16.324 --> 24:17.717
And then they just split up.

24:17.717 --> 24:19.414
They talked about
going back together,

24:19.414 --> 24:21.329
but Mr. Big suffered
a big depression

24:21.329 --> 24:24.593
and crashed his car,
almost lost his leg.

24:24.593 --> 24:27.161
The Cookie Club was over
just like that.

24:27.161 --> 24:30.773
We lost our biggest draw.
And when I say big I mean big.

24:30.773 --> 24:32.601
Now why don't you just go
get ready?

24:32.601 --> 24:34.516
You got a tough crowd
waiting for you.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.344
Miss Rita, you talking
about the lonely bunch

24:36.344 --> 24:38.259
of happy hour ladies?

24:38.259 --> 24:39.521
They do not scare me.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.481
Bet you didn't expect flowers!

24:42.481 --> 24:44.700
<i> Now my baby
was fearless for sure,</i>

24:44.700 --> 24:46.833
<i>but sometimes, fear is good.</i>

24:46.833 --> 24:49.618
<i>There are things
you should be afraid of.</i>

24:49.618 --> 24:51.446
Give him a chance.

24:51.446 --> 24:54.144
This guy sucks!
We want karaoke!

24:54.884 --> 24:56.451
- You want karaoke?
- Yeah.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.497
You want karaoke? Well, have
y'all heard of that one song

24:58.497 --> 25:00.237
about the guy who liked
chicken wings with two thumbs

25:00.237 --> 25:02.936
because you know who wrote that?
- No.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.286
Who wrote it? It was me!
I wrote it 'cause it's me.

25:06.766 --> 25:09.464
<i> Like doing magic
for some thirsty hoes</i>

25:09.464 --> 25:12.380
<i>who'd rather be getting drunk
or getting laid.</i>

25:12.380 --> 25:14.382
You real feisty. Now you been
giving me problems all night.

25:14.382 --> 25:16.123
What you sipping on?
'Cause I'm trying to get loose.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
Oh, I'm drinking
on that firewater, baby.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.170
- Oh, that firewater?
- Yeah.

25:20.170 --> 25:21.563
Firewater? She's sipping
on that firewater.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.434
Y'all want to see some
entertainment, right?

25:23.434 --> 25:25.480
Give me some firewater.
Jesus Christ

25:25.480 --> 25:27.830
Y'all want to see some
entertainment? Y'all want it?

25:27.830 --> 25:29.310
We're gonna get some
entertainment in the house!

25:29.310 --> 25:31.486
We're gonna get some
entertainment! Okay?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.053
This is a disaster.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.533
Mm-hmm! Mm-hmm!

25:34.533 --> 25:38.145
<i> Or like trying
his fire-breathing trick</i>

25:38.145 --> 25:40.582
<i>for the first time
in front of the Cookie Club's</i>

25:40.582 --> 25:42.584
<i>biggest star of all time.</i>

25:43.585 --> 25:46.370
<i>Luther "Mr. Big" Ellis.</i>
- Goddamn.

25:46.370 --> 25:47.676
Oh, my god!

25:47.676 --> 25:49.199
Oh, my god, no!

25:50.636 --> 25:52.289
I don't know how to...

25:53.334 --> 25:55.075
It's on my shirt too!

25:55.989 --> 25:58.557
It's on my leg! It's on my leg!

25:58.861 --> 26:01.429
Oh, wait! Wait! Yes!

26:04.258 --> 26:06.565
- Um...
- Shake that magic rod, yes!

26:09.002 --> 26:10.569
That's my kind of trick!

26:10.569 --> 26:11.918
Oh!

26:12.745 --> 26:14.094
Good Lord.

26:14.094 --> 26:17.010
Luther, are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

26:17.837 --> 26:19.012
We back in business.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.406
Man!

26:27.586 --> 26:29.500
Hello?
<i> Hey, Merlin.</i>

26:29.500 --> 26:31.328
Robin. Oh, hey, Robin!

26:31.328 --> 26:32.852
You left without saying
goodbye the other day.

26:32.852 --> 26:33.722
Is everything okay with you?

26:33.722 --> 26:35.768
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.378
It's great. It's great.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.598
In fact, I just had
my first Vegas gig

26:39.598 --> 26:42.122
<i>and I got a standing ovation.</i>

26:42.122 --> 26:44.037
Wow! Sounds like it
was a hot show!

26:44.037 --> 26:48.694
Yep, it was fire, but not
as surprising as the party was.

26:48.694 --> 26:53.481
Yeah, I had no idea
he was going to propose.

26:54.047 --> 26:55.918
Yeah, um...

26:55.918 --> 26:58.791
I guess you and Blaze
will be dancing together

26:58.791 --> 26:59.966
for a long time.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.969
Yeah.

27:07.190 --> 27:10.367
Merlin, there's someone
out here I want you to meet.

27:10.367 --> 27:11.760
I actually got to go.

27:12.674 --> 27:13.980
Me too.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.637
Bye.

27:23.424 --> 27:25.165
Wait, so you want me
to be a stripper?

27:25.165 --> 27:28.168
A stripper? No, a Chip.

27:28.168 --> 27:29.996
But I can't dance.
I'm a magician.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.694
Can't, can't, can't.
Ain't no can't in Vegas.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.566
Boy, Vegas, you got to be
whatever you got to be
to survive.

27:35.566 --> 27:37.786
Them women gave you more tips
than you ever made

27:37.786 --> 27:39.614
doing all of
that magic bullshit.

27:39.614 --> 27:43.009
That's right. And after
you jiggled your jewels tonight,

27:43.009 --> 27:46.186
those horny bitches ran out
my highest bar tab in weeks.

27:46.186 --> 27:48.710
You see? Everybody wins.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.060
Rita gets to pay her bills

27:51.060 --> 27:54.150
and you get more cash
for your stash.

27:54.150 --> 27:58.807
Okay, so you want me
to go out there alone

27:58.807 --> 28:02.028
and shake my ass for money
every night?

28:02.028 --> 28:03.769
Of course not.

28:03.769 --> 28:05.248
You've got Sundays off.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.949
Boy, you ain't gonna be alone.

28:09.949 --> 28:11.646
So, what, you gonna hire
more dancers?

28:11.646 --> 28:13.866
Fuck no, we ain't got
no money for that.

28:13.866 --> 28:17.391
No, you and The Chips.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.655
The Chips? You haven't talked
to The Chips in years.

28:21.525 --> 28:22.744
How are you going to find them?

28:24.137 --> 28:26.313
<i> So my son left LA
looking for magic,</i>

28:26.313 --> 28:29.011
<i>but now the one and only
Mr. Big</i>

28:29.011 --> 28:31.274
<i>was about to teach him
some new tricks.</i>

28:31.274 --> 28:32.493
God dang, man,

28:32.493 --> 28:34.103
I just hope you got AC
up in this place.

28:34.103 --> 28:35.757
I'm sweating my balls off
out here in this heat.

28:35.757 --> 28:38.455
Ain't no hotter than
you lighting your ass on fire.

28:38.455 --> 28:40.153
You're lucky
you still got balls.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.241
- Yeah.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.157
How a young kid like you
get into magic anyway?

28:44.157 --> 28:46.289
My mom let me try a bunch
of different things

28:46.289 --> 28:48.161
and magic was just
the best path for me.

28:49.684 --> 28:51.991
Well, every path has a detour.
Thank God.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.167
Yeah, no kidding.

28:54.167 --> 28:56.647
I mean, I'm already lying
to Robin about my magic working.

28:56.647 --> 28:59.041
Now I gotta fool her about me
being a stripper too.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.173
Who is that, Robin?

29:00.173 --> 29:01.261
Robin, who is that,
your girlfriend?

29:01.261 --> 29:05.091
No, she's...
she's a girl, and...

29:05.091 --> 29:08.094
Okay, well, she's a girl
and she's like a friend.

29:08.094 --> 29:10.618
She would be my girlfriend too,

29:10.618 --> 29:12.751
but she's got this
stupid fiancé so I'm...

29:12.751 --> 29:15.275
- Oh, she got a fiancé?
- Yeah.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.799
- Your girl got a fiancé?
- Hm-hmm.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.845
Well, it seems to me the only
person that you're fooling

29:19.845 --> 29:20.759
is yourself.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.892
- Whatever, man.

29:23.892 --> 29:26.068
Glad you got a big ding-ding, boy.

29:30.986 --> 29:31.987
All right.

29:33.902 --> 29:34.816
Yeah.

29:35.643 --> 29:38.341
Des. Look at that body.
Still in shape!

29:41.562 --> 29:44.521
Baby, I need...
No, two more 255 on seven!

29:44.521 --> 29:48.787
Oh, so, I guess the shape
you meant was round.

29:48.787 --> 29:50.049
Des?

29:52.312 --> 29:55.968
Luther Ellis? Oh, man!

29:55.968 --> 29:58.013
It's been like 20 years, baby!

29:58.013 --> 29:59.972
You still look good,
look at you!

29:59.972 --> 30:01.364
You sure as hell don't!

30:01.364 --> 30:02.888
Oh, I gained a little weight.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.628
I mean, look, just a smidge.

30:04.628 --> 30:06.500
- Des!
- What, baby?

30:06.500 --> 30:08.154
This is good living, baby.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.808
And the shirt's too small.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.287
Who's your compadre right here?

30:11.287 --> 30:13.724
- I'm Merlin.
- Did you say breakfast?

30:14.160 --> 30:15.291
Who said pancakes?

30:15.814 --> 30:17.467
Well, shit, let's go.
Let me wash up.

30:17.467 --> 30:18.860
Shit, you're looking good, baby!

30:18.860 --> 30:22.646
Grits, you a grits guy.
I know you like grits.

30:23.038 --> 30:25.475
So, you thinking about putting
the band back together, huh?

30:25.475 --> 30:28.000
Do you think he'd be here
if he wasn't?

30:28.000 --> 30:29.784
Who the fuck is you?

30:30.741 --> 30:32.439
And are you eating
this right here?

30:33.092 --> 30:34.223
Nah.

30:34.223 --> 30:35.311
What about your leg?

30:35.311 --> 30:37.400
My dancing days
is over, buddy.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.446
But I got a ringer.

30:39.446 --> 30:41.883
So, Luther done found himself
a new Mr. Big, huh?

30:41.883 --> 30:43.798
Yeah, yeah, I guess.

30:43.798 --> 30:46.409
Oh, the boy's talented.
So talented.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.543
Well, we had fun back then, man.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.892
Didn't we?

30:50.892 --> 30:52.894
I don't think that group
would work out now.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.201
It ain't the group
that needs to work out, Des.

30:55.201 --> 30:57.159
Listen, I'm still
the same body

30:57.159 --> 30:58.857
underneath all of this, baby.

30:58.857 --> 31:01.076
Well, stop acting like
you don't miss it.

31:01.076 --> 31:03.557
I mean, the women, the cheers.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.168
The tips! The tips?

31:06.168 --> 31:10.216
I do. But look, business
is booming, baby.

31:10.216 --> 31:12.087
Did you know that Pahrump,

31:12.087 --> 31:14.176
the place you in right now, Pahrump,

31:14.176 --> 31:17.484
is the number one city
to kill yourself?

31:17.484 --> 31:18.702
Get me out of here, man.

31:19.660 --> 31:21.140
I'm so God damned bored.

31:22.097 --> 31:23.664
I got you.

31:23.664 --> 31:25.884
Where's the party?
Where's the party?

31:25.884 --> 31:27.842
Where's the party at, uh!

31:27.842 --> 31:29.757
That's right!

31:29.757 --> 31:31.541
- I'm in.
- All right. Good.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.413
You know where to find
the rest of the guys?

31:33.413 --> 31:35.545
Hell no, especially
that crotch-stuffing,

31:35.545 --> 31:37.156
no-talking Dr. X.

31:37.156 --> 31:39.593
And you know I don't talk
to Slim!

31:39.593 --> 31:41.029
After he took my girl.

31:41.638 --> 31:42.944
Get over it, baby!

31:42.944 --> 31:44.424
Well, I might have
Face's number.

31:44.424 --> 31:45.686
He came here last year
wanting me

31:45.686 --> 31:47.644
to customize his car
for his girls.

31:47.644 --> 31:51.474
My man Tyriq, huh?
Still pampering the ladies?

31:52.345 --> 31:53.824
He's pampering, all right.

31:53.824 --> 31:55.087
Quadruplets?

31:56.392 --> 31:57.741
Brother!

31:57.741 --> 31:59.743
A lot has changed since
the last time I saw you

31:59.743 --> 32:02.877
with four girls in one bed,
but this right here?

32:02.877 --> 32:05.445
I never pictured you
settling down.

32:05.445 --> 32:07.664
- Does it look like I settled?
- No!

32:07.664 --> 32:09.318
He got you there, Luther.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.277
I mean, yo,
your home is beautiful.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.627
- It's not mine, it's my lady's.

32:14.280 --> 32:17.152
When the Chips closed, I applied
for every type of job.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.327
I got nothing.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.720
So, I went back to stripping.

32:20.416 --> 32:22.941
I actually did a party here
for this rich chick.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.899
Next thing I know,
spent the night,

32:24.899 --> 32:27.641
she said I could spend
another day, a week,

32:27.641 --> 32:29.773
a month, a year.

32:29.773 --> 32:31.775
Then she just woke up
one morning and she said,

32:31.775 --> 32:34.691
"You can stay here as long
as you want if we have a baby."

32:35.083 --> 32:37.694
And we started using
fertility drugs

32:37.694 --> 32:40.610
and, as you can see, it worked!
- No shit!

32:41.916 --> 32:43.918
So, you finally
got them to sleep?

32:46.181 --> 32:49.576
Oh, that's a nice pic of you
and your girls, man.

32:49.576 --> 32:51.056
Check you out, flexing the guns!

32:51.056 --> 32:52.971
Those are not mine,
those are my lady's.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.886
She's a top ranked
mixed martial arts fighter.

32:55.886 --> 32:57.149
While she's out there
kicking ass,

32:57.149 --> 32:59.281
I'm stuck up in here wiping ass.

32:59.281 --> 33:02.458
Damn, Face,
your girl is jacked!

33:02.458 --> 33:04.330
Two-time champ,

33:04.330 --> 33:06.593
and she'd put me
in a four-legged oomoplata

33:06.593 --> 33:09.248
if she knew I was two-timing her
with the Chips.

33:09.248 --> 33:11.772
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You ain't cheating, now.

33:11.772 --> 33:12.642
You dancing.

33:14.035 --> 33:16.690
And it looks like she spends
a lot of time out of town, right?

33:16.690 --> 33:18.126
True.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.172
Well, how she going to know?

33:20.868 --> 33:23.436
You think you guys could hook
me up with some daycare
or something?

33:23.436 --> 33:26.178
- Brother!
- Oh, baby, come on!

33:28.136 --> 33:30.399
- Don't wake up the babies.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

33:30.399 --> 33:31.226
I'm sorry.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.662
Look, do you got any idea

33:32.662 --> 33:34.664
how the hell we could find
the rest of the guys?

33:34.664 --> 33:36.231
Dr. X is a mystery to me.

33:36.231 --> 33:38.190
I don't know what happened
to his flat ass.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.148
But I do know how
you can get to Slim.

33:40.148 --> 33:42.498
And he's a long way from hell.

33:49.418 --> 33:53.640
I see today we got
a lot of empty pews

33:53.640 --> 33:57.078
in this church of God.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.211
Oh, you've got
to be shitting me.

33:59.211 --> 34:03.084
Because people spent the night
partying in the club.

34:03.084 --> 34:05.521
I see a few people
missing right now!

34:05.521 --> 34:08.524
Where is Joseph?
Where is Corinne?

34:09.960 --> 34:11.049
I don't see Bernadette.

34:12.180 --> 34:14.313
Where's Jimmy? Jimmy!

34:16.358 --> 34:19.666
But couldn't find it
in their will or in their soul

34:19.666 --> 34:21.363
or in their presence

34:21.363 --> 34:24.627
to get up and make their way
to church

34:24.627 --> 34:26.716
to praise the Lord.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.067
Man, I thought you said
he was the sexy one.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.026
That ain't the Slim
I used to know.

34:32.853 --> 34:34.507
Church ain't popping!

34:34.507 --> 34:37.336
You mean to tell me
the Lord ain't popping?

34:37.814 --> 34:39.773
You think church can't turn up?

34:39.773 --> 34:43.342
Well, they say the Lord
will help you find the way...

34:44.473 --> 34:46.171
...but you got to meet
the Lord halfway.

34:47.694 --> 34:49.957
Can I get an amen?
- Amen!

34:51.437 --> 34:53.395
What's happening
in them clubs?

34:53.395 --> 34:55.354
You know what they doing
in the club?

34:55.354 --> 34:57.095
Bumping and grinding
all over each other!

34:57.095 --> 35:00.010
They're in that club last night.
Oh!

35:00.010 --> 35:02.665
They're shaking, they bumping

35:02.665 --> 35:04.537
and they grinding
all over each other.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.714
Hey, what's going on in here?
This ain't for us!

35:07.714 --> 35:10.108
They teabagging!
They teabagging!

35:10.108 --> 35:13.502
You don't get no tea.
The Lord ain't in them!

35:13.502 --> 35:15.765
Boom, bang, boom,
pow, boom, pow!

35:15.765 --> 35:17.550
Do the washing machine!

35:17.550 --> 35:19.160
Damn, he's still got it!

35:24.209 --> 35:26.428
Bumping and grinding,
bumping and grinding,

35:26.428 --> 35:28.126
bumping and grinding
all over each other!

35:30.128 --> 35:32.260
So, you fools are really
thinking about

35:32.260 --> 35:34.175
putting the Chips back together?

35:34.175 --> 35:35.829
Oh!
- Here you go, dear.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.048
Thank you, sweetie.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.400
It's so nice to see you all.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.402
Have a blessed day.

35:43.402 --> 35:44.794
Thank you, sweetie.

35:48.189 --> 35:50.365
Are you out of
your God damn mind?

35:50.365 --> 35:51.801
Excuse me, Lord.

35:51.801 --> 35:54.195
But that's got to be
the stupidest motherfucking idea

35:54.195 --> 35:55.370
I ever heard in my life!

35:55.370 --> 35:58.634
Oh, it's stupid, is it?
It's stupid?

35:58.634 --> 36:01.768
Man, I just saw you do
half your old dance moves.

36:01.768 --> 36:04.727
You had these church ladies
about to make it rain, baby.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.338
I'm just using my calling

36:06.338 --> 36:08.427
to excite these ladies
about the gospel.

36:08.427 --> 36:10.385
That is all.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.996
And also release some
pent-up tension I got going on.

36:12.996 --> 36:14.346
Yeah, no offense, Pastor,

36:14.346 --> 36:16.043
but if you get them
any more excited,

36:16.043 --> 36:17.784
your church is going
to need a champagne room.

36:18.350 --> 36:20.700
Well, if it's sexual tension
you mean,

36:20.700 --> 36:22.223
then maybe I need
to talk to your wife.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.616
Hey, don't you go near
my wife!

36:23.616 --> 36:24.878
Don't you go near my wife.

36:24.878 --> 36:26.184
I done told you about
that before.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.056
I done told you!
Leave my wife alone.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.974
I need some sugar.

36:38.979 --> 36:40.546
There's some sugar.

36:40.546 --> 36:42.069
Desmond?

36:42.069 --> 36:43.113
Eve!

36:43.113 --> 36:46.204
- Oh my goodness!
- Oh, wow!

36:46.204 --> 36:47.683
- Um...
- Whoa!

36:47.683 --> 36:48.858
You look...

36:48.858 --> 36:50.599
I grew a beard.

36:50.599 --> 36:52.906
It's a little different for me.

36:52.906 --> 36:54.777
But you look lovely as ever.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.172
Oh, thank you.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.610
So, how are you?
- Amazing.

37:01.610 --> 37:06.136
I have a little auto body place
out in Pahrump, you know.

37:06.136 --> 37:07.529
Still single, though.

37:07.964 --> 37:10.663
Still haven't found anybody
to treat me as well as you did.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.449
That's very sweet.

37:14.449 --> 37:17.539
Listen, Desmond,
I need to apologize to you.

37:17.539 --> 37:21.021
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No. Please.

37:22.240 --> 37:25.808
For years, I was very judgmental
of your work.

37:25.808 --> 37:28.637
And now, in hindsight,

37:28.637 --> 37:30.596
I see how women may enjoy it.

37:32.859 --> 37:36.645
Listen, no need to apologize.
As long as you're happy.

37:40.083 --> 37:42.564
- Amos and I are very happy.
- Hmm!

37:42.564 --> 37:46.046
We are blessed and he always
treats me with the utmost...

37:46.046 --> 37:47.526
Respect!

37:47.526 --> 37:49.267
I would never do anything
inappropriate to my wife.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.312
He'd never do anything
inappropriate to me.

37:51.312 --> 37:55.142
But after 25 years,
things can feel a little too...

37:55.142 --> 37:58.363
Tame! My wife's an angel.
I'm a lucky man to have her.

37:58.363 --> 38:02.192
But sometimes you just want
to get wild!

38:02.192 --> 38:06.109
...so mild. In private,
he's the perfect gentleman.

38:06.109 --> 38:09.330
Too gentle! I just want
to go crazy!

38:09.330 --> 38:10.766
You know me!

38:10.766 --> 38:13.769
I'll tell you what's crazy is...

38:13.769 --> 38:15.858
Slim Sexy is now a preacher.

38:15.858 --> 38:18.339
I can't even look at you.

38:18.339 --> 38:21.734
I'll tell you what you can't
look at is your feet, big man.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.866
What about you,
Reverend Gyrate?

38:23.866 --> 38:26.304
I don't know if you born again
or porn again.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.827
- Oh!
- Huh?

38:27.827 --> 38:31.570
I don't care what you say.
I'm satisfied with who I am.

38:31.570 --> 38:33.528
Are you, big man?

38:33.528 --> 38:36.052
The question is; is your wife?

38:36.052 --> 38:38.316
- Oh Lord.
- Hold this.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.884
Hey, come on. I done told you
about my wife.

38:47.281 --> 38:48.587
Yo, are you going
to do something?

38:48.587 --> 38:50.328
I brought him here
to work this shit out.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.895
- Well, it ain't working! Yo!
- Keep on calling!

38:52.895 --> 38:54.375
All right, all right,
all right.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.855
You all in the Lord's house now.

38:55.855 --> 38:58.292
- Sit your ass down!
- Pushing it!

38:59.424 --> 39:01.121
Dignified.
You're in the church.

39:02.383 --> 39:04.603
Luther, I don't care
how you say it, nothing,

39:04.603 --> 39:06.300
I mean, nothing,

39:06.300 --> 39:08.302
is going to change my mind.
I'm good!

39:08.302 --> 39:10.086
- Oh, is that right?
- That's right.

39:10.086 --> 39:11.784
Hey, Rita, are you there?

39:11.784 --> 39:13.002
<i> Yes, I am.</i>

39:13.002 --> 39:14.613
<i>Are you fuckers going
to help or not?</i>

39:14.613 --> 39:18.094
Now, look here, The Moxie's in
trouble and it needs money ASAP.

39:18.617 --> 39:20.401
Now, if you ain't going
to do it for us,

39:20.401 --> 39:22.447
then do it for Rita.

39:22.925 --> 39:25.537
Oh, you remember when
she found your homeless ass

39:25.537 --> 39:28.148
on the bus stop
and made you a Chip.

39:28.148 --> 39:30.280
And Face is already in.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.935
Come on, man,
what would Jesus do...

39:32.935 --> 39:34.197
if he was an old ass stripper?

39:35.155 --> 39:39.289
Look, even if I did say yes,
you're still down a Chip.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.291
And no one's seen that
mask-wearing mute

39:41.291 --> 39:42.597
Dr. X anywhere.

39:42.597 --> 39:44.077
<i> Well, I saw him.</i>

39:44.077 --> 39:46.732
<i>I got lucky and found him
on a medical database.</i>

39:47.428 --> 39:49.299
You mean, X became
a real doctor?

39:49.299 --> 39:51.693
<i>Plastic surgeon.
I just called his office.</i>

39:51.693 --> 39:55.044
<i>He's exactly where you'd expect
to find a doctor on a Sunday.</i>

39:55.654 --> 39:59.440
We do have some special gifts,
and I want to say--

39:59.440 --> 40:00.963
Rita must have gave us
the wrong address,

40:00.963 --> 40:03.183
because the only brothers
I see here are the waiters.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.011
And we're going
to go ahead now

40:05.011 --> 40:06.229
and give our final award.

40:06.229 --> 40:07.840
I think you know who
I'm talking about.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.582
Let's give it up
for Dr. Xander Pike.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.681
I know you Harvard men
really wanted this,

40:22.681 --> 40:24.422
just like you guys want my wife.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.249
I see you looking, she's mine.

40:28.469 --> 40:29.731
Xander's white?

40:29.731 --> 40:31.298
Thus the mask.

40:31.298 --> 40:34.083
- And the flat ass.
- And the small dick.

40:35.345 --> 40:36.956
I'm sure you guys got
a lot of questions.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.827
Um, back in the day,

40:38.827 --> 40:40.394
I was trying to get through
medical school,

40:40.394 --> 40:42.570
and the Chippendales rejected me
because I danced too big.

40:43.745 --> 40:45.138
Saw the Chip auditions.

40:45.138 --> 40:46.966
So, I went to the tanning bed,

40:46.966 --> 40:49.838
shaved my head, got a mask
and, bam, Dr. X!

40:49.838 --> 40:52.275
And, bam, you lied
about being black.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.495
Did not lie, I never said
I was black. You just assumed.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.975
You know what they say
when you assume.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.890
Yeah, you make an ass
out of you

40:57.890 --> 40:59.761
and some dumbass
black strippers.

40:59.761 --> 41:02.111
Doc is out for the reunion.

41:02.111 --> 41:04.723
Why am I out? That was
the best time of my life.

41:04.723 --> 41:08.074
I loved being black.
Being white is so boring!

41:08.074 --> 41:12.382
Between the food, the music,
the dance and the TV shows.

41:12.382 --> 41:13.732
You ever tried to stay awake

41:13.732 --> 41:15.298
to watch an episode
of The Crown?

41:15.298 --> 41:16.778
You know what
it was like for me?

41:16.778 --> 41:18.650
I couldn't get a job anywhere
when the Chips broke up.

41:18.650 --> 41:21.174
Now, you, you're a doctor?

41:21.174 --> 41:22.784
I did get into
a top medical school.

41:22.784 --> 41:25.091
I'm sure you got in
the top everything.

41:25.091 --> 41:26.745
You know how easy it is
to get in

41:26.745 --> 41:28.834
when your name's Alexander
and not Tyriq?

41:28.834 --> 41:31.140
I didn't name you that,
blame your parents!

41:31.140 --> 41:34.230
Could we at least take a vote?
I am an original Chocolate Chip.

41:34.230 --> 41:37.364
No! You was just
chocolate dipped.

41:37.364 --> 41:38.452
The conditions have changed.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.106
Okay, you know,
you all changed!

41:40.106 --> 41:42.630
All right, Face, look,
you got four kids.

41:42.630 --> 41:44.458
Amos is a preacher.
- I'm a damn good preacher.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.329
I know, I know. And Des, Des...

41:46.329 --> 41:47.853
I gained a smidgen of weight.

41:47.853 --> 41:49.376
He got a smidgen
of weight, exactly.

41:49.376 --> 41:52.074
Look, look, look,
it's all or nothing, okay?

41:52.074 --> 41:54.033
You got it?
Look, if you down with us,

41:54.033 --> 41:56.601
meet us at the Cookie Club
at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.559
I'll be there 4:45.

42:00.866 --> 42:02.389
Okay, I guess I'm in.

42:02.389 --> 42:04.522
Now, you said you had daycare,
so who is it?

42:06.567 --> 42:08.874
Oh, come on, man,
you can't expect me

42:08.874 --> 42:12.225
to leave Ella, Della, Bella,
and Stella with Rita!

42:12.225 --> 42:13.879
She can't handle
all these babies!

42:13.879 --> 42:15.489
Well, let me get
this straight.

42:15.489 --> 42:17.012
After I washed all your mankinis

42:17.012 --> 42:19.798
and then I cleaned all the crabs
out of the champagne room

42:19.798 --> 42:22.061
that I could handle
all you babies,

42:22.061 --> 42:24.498
but I can't handle those babies?

42:25.934 --> 42:27.501
Get the fuck out of here.

42:27.501 --> 42:30.025
- We got it, Luther, we got it.
- It's been a minute.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.549
Everybody remember
the steps, right?

42:32.201 --> 42:35.944
Here we go.
Five, six, seven, eight!

42:41.863 --> 42:43.735
- <i>
- So,
after two decades,</i>

42:43.735 --> 42:45.519
<i>the Chocolate Chips
were finally back on stage</i>

42:45.519 --> 42:47.608
<i>to show Merlin their routines.</i>

42:47.608 --> 42:50.829
<i>Too bad these old motherfuckers
couldn't remember them!</i>

42:51.351 --> 42:52.613
- What you doing?
- I'm doing...

42:52.613 --> 42:53.919
I can't move that fast, man!

42:53.919 --> 42:56.138
Y'all, get this shit right.

42:56.138 --> 42:58.184
You know how we do this.
Set this mother off.

42:58.184 --> 43:01.013
Five, six, seven, eight!

43:02.231 --> 43:04.364
Bring it down, bring it down.

43:14.766 --> 43:16.376
Terrible!

43:20.946 --> 43:22.600
- Come on, man.
- The women...

43:22.600 --> 43:25.994
- This is not a Lil Nas X video!
- Good God!

43:25.994 --> 43:28.562
Man, do you think
they'll ever get it together?

43:29.563 --> 43:32.435
Don't know, kid.
Could go either way.

43:33.349 --> 43:35.177
Lot of issues to work through.

43:35.177 --> 43:37.179
Yeah, tell me about it.

43:37.179 --> 43:39.617
No wonder y'all split up
with all that drama.

43:40.095 --> 43:41.923
I could see why
you're still pissed off

43:41.923 --> 43:43.751
about losing all that money.

43:43.751 --> 43:45.492
I could see why you're
so depressed.

43:47.233 --> 43:49.191
Rita tell you that?

43:49.191 --> 43:50.845
Rita don't know shit.

43:51.324 --> 43:53.065
Nobody knows what
really went down.

43:55.807 --> 43:56.851
All right!

43:58.679 --> 43:59.724
Let's try it again.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.598
Work for it! Sexy, let's go!

44:04.598 --> 44:06.905
Go on. You don't want it.
You don't want success.

44:06.905 --> 44:08.602
I can tell you don't want it.

44:08.602 --> 44:10.343
One, to the right.

44:12.084 --> 44:14.826
To the right, to the left!

44:14.826 --> 44:16.697
Crush again, crush again!

44:16.697 --> 44:18.612
Merlin, I expect more of you.

44:18.612 --> 44:20.832
Bang-bang,
or bang-bang bang-bang?

44:20.832 --> 44:22.529
The bang's up, you pop
your bangs up too high!

44:22.529 --> 44:23.530
Yeah, he over-banging.

44:23.530 --> 44:26.707
Push it! Push high, push high!

44:26.707 --> 44:29.057
Roll with it, roll with it.

44:29.057 --> 44:32.104
<i>Suck it up.
Five, six, seven, eight!</i>

44:32.104 --> 44:35.194
Three... four... go!

44:35.194 --> 44:39.372
Tea bag! Tea bag! Tea bag!
Tea bag! Tea bag! Tea bag!

44:39.372 --> 44:40.939
Sexy, that's what
you're going to give me?

44:40.939 --> 44:42.636
Shut up!

44:42.636 --> 44:44.594
This is how you
make champions, guys!

44:59.740 --> 45:01.089
How do you even eat a salad?

45:02.090 --> 45:04.397
All right, all right.

45:04.397 --> 45:07.487
Now they started looking
like the way it used to. Yeah!

45:08.488 --> 45:10.185
Searching for music.

45:10.185 --> 45:11.665
Picking out costumes.

45:12.666 --> 45:13.798
And X pretending to be black.

45:13.798 --> 45:15.147
It's not black, it's caramel.

45:15.147 --> 45:16.975
Well, it looks
like shit to me.

45:16.975 --> 45:18.541
This is bullshit, Luther.

45:18.541 --> 45:20.805
Hey, hey, hey,
it's a reunion show.

45:20.805 --> 45:22.937
He's supposed to look
the way he did before.

45:22.937 --> 45:25.374
What's Des going to do?

45:25.374 --> 45:28.116
Unless you got a time machine,
that ain't going to happen.

45:28.726 --> 45:30.075
See, that's a fat joke.

45:30.075 --> 45:31.990
I'm getting tired of these
God damned fat jokes!

45:31.990 --> 45:34.427
Matter of fact, you know what?
Give me this piece of pie.

45:34.427 --> 45:36.342
Hey, don't you touch
that pizza now!

45:36.342 --> 45:37.691
- It's him!
- Yo, yo, guys!

45:37.691 --> 45:38.866
I think I found
my showcase song,

45:38.866 --> 45:40.955
and it's one of my mom's
favorite jams.

45:45.351 --> 45:47.788
- Yo.
- Turn it off, kid.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.659
All right, God damn it,
enough of this.

45:49.659 --> 45:51.487
No more bitching
about X's colour

45:51.487 --> 45:53.228
and no more touching the pizza.

45:53.228 --> 45:55.535
And nobody plays that song!

46:01.846 --> 46:03.369
You know what?

46:04.849 --> 46:06.546
I'm going to work
on my wardrobe.

46:07.808 --> 46:10.158
I'm going to go look
for a gym.

46:15.424 --> 46:17.122
I almost smacked you with
the black hand side.

46:17.122 --> 46:18.819
Don't ever play that song again!

46:19.428 --> 46:23.737
That song you just played
was Mr. Big's closing song.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.349
Oh, boy!

46:27.349 --> 46:30.744
Help me, Lord! Help!

46:36.489 --> 46:38.926
<i> Now, Merlin had
performed for crowds before,</i>

46:38.926 --> 46:40.493
<i>but never like this.</i>

46:40.493 --> 46:43.670
<i>So, he was nervous about
showing his ass, literally.</i>

46:43.670 --> 46:46.673
<i>But with Robin and magic
both out of the picture,</i>

46:46.673 --> 46:48.806
<i>he figured he had
nothing to lose.</i>

46:48.806 --> 46:51.460
<i>And the only person
he could talk to about it</i>

46:51.460 --> 46:54.507
<i>was a man who had
lost everything.</i>

46:54.507 --> 46:56.248
Oh, wow!

46:57.684 --> 46:59.381
I know what I'm doing here late

46:59.381 --> 47:00.992
trying to fix
this doggone sound system,

47:00.992 --> 47:02.602
but what you doing here so late?

47:02.602 --> 47:04.517
I'm still trying to figure out
my solo, okay?

47:04.517 --> 47:06.954
I have no idea what it should
be. Luther, I can't do this!

47:06.954 --> 47:09.652
Here you go with that can't
again. Ain't no can't in Vegas!

47:10.479 --> 47:12.307
Boy, you good,
don't worry about it.

47:12.307 --> 47:15.136
You just have to figure out
what your alter-ego is.

47:15.136 --> 47:16.790
Yeah, your special identity!

47:16.790 --> 47:20.881
Find something that's unique
to you, that makes you unique.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.535
Okay, well, that's easy
for you to say!

47:22.535 --> 47:24.842
It's not like you have to get
up here and dance anymore.

47:24.842 --> 47:26.539
- Oh, you think I don't want to?
- No!

47:26.539 --> 47:28.019
I would if I could.

47:28.019 --> 47:30.543
But I can't, so that's
why they got you!

47:30.543 --> 47:32.501
- All right, well, I didn't
mean nothing by that.

47:32.501 --> 47:34.939
I just know you had to stop
dancing because of your leg.

47:34.939 --> 47:37.680
Well, it wasn't just
my leg that got broke.

47:37.680 --> 47:39.421
But that's, you don't know
nothing about that.

47:39.421 --> 47:42.772
We ain't worried about it.
Tomorrow is a big night!

47:43.251 --> 47:44.513
Been a while since
the Chips danced

47:44.513 --> 47:45.732
in front of a live audience,

47:45.732 --> 47:48.213
so we're going to have
a little preview.

47:59.485 --> 48:00.878
Back the fuck up.

48:02.488 --> 48:03.619
Sorry.

48:04.098 --> 48:06.318
You're a doctor! Why don't you
just create a bigger cock?

48:06.318 --> 48:07.754
Well, that's why I became one.

48:07.754 --> 48:09.930
Women got a lot of options
for body enhancements

48:09.930 --> 48:11.453
and men, we just don't.

48:11.453 --> 48:12.759
But I plan to change that.

48:12.759 --> 48:15.370
- Like, dick implants?
- Close.

48:15.893 --> 48:18.417
I know one woman who'd like
a little something extra.

48:19.157 --> 48:20.506
I just can't give it to her.

48:21.072 --> 48:23.813
How did we not know
this dude was white?

48:24.597 --> 48:27.339
<i> And as my baby looked
into the crowd,</i>

48:27.339 --> 48:29.907
<i>he couldn't believe how much
his world had changed.</i>

48:29.907 --> 48:32.213
<i>But what the Chips
didn't realize</i>

48:32.213 --> 48:34.781
<i>was that the world
had changed on them, too.</i>

48:36.304 --> 48:38.176
Oh, shoot!

48:38.176 --> 48:40.874
What's wrong, kid, you nervous?
- Yes, man!

48:40.874 --> 48:42.093
There's so many people
out there!

48:42.093 --> 48:43.616
It's a small crowd,
just work out!

48:43.616 --> 48:45.618
Yeah, so if you mess up,
nobody is going to know!

48:45.618 --> 48:49.187
You about to pop your cherry!

48:49.187 --> 48:51.406
You old and stuff, but haven't
you all heard of the internet?

48:51.406 --> 48:54.105
They record one mistake,
and it's on there forever.

48:54.105 --> 48:55.454
- He's scared!

48:56.281 --> 48:57.586
This is DJ St. Aubyn.

48:57.586 --> 49:00.198
It's been a long time,
but guess who's back?

49:00.198 --> 49:01.721
The Chocolate Chips!

49:03.331 --> 49:05.290
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

49:05.290 --> 49:06.465
Let's go!

49:06.465 --> 49:08.336
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

49:12.906 --> 49:14.429
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

49:14.429 --> 49:16.518
Des The Body,
Dr. X,

49:16.518 --> 49:18.912
Slim Sexy, The Face,

49:18.912 --> 49:21.523
and Merlin.
The Chocolate Chips!

49:29.357 --> 49:30.793
We fucking froze, man!

49:30.793 --> 49:32.752
Ain't nobody said it
was going to be easy.

49:32.752 --> 49:34.014
All right, just shake it off!

49:34.014 --> 49:35.885
We looked like fools
out there, man!

49:35.885 --> 49:38.149
But that's what tonight
is for, right?

49:38.149 --> 49:39.237
To work the kinks out.

49:39.237 --> 49:41.326
Face, you up next, baby.
- What?

49:41.326 --> 49:44.372
Man, there's somebody's babies
out there, go be they daddy.

49:44.372 --> 49:47.506
- You got it, Face.
- Come on, man, come on, baby!

49:47.506 --> 49:49.638
- Give them the Face!
- Bring it home, Face.

49:50.117 --> 49:53.338
Ladies, welcome to the stage
your new daddy,

49:53.338 --> 49:55.035
The Face.

50:13.184 --> 50:16.100
Face out here trying
to be your father figure.

50:16.839 --> 50:18.841
Hey, hey, wait, wait, what?

50:18.841 --> 50:20.539
Is the stripper
brushing her hair?

50:21.627 --> 50:24.021
That's kind of weird!

50:24.021 --> 50:25.805
And kind of sexy.

50:25.805 --> 50:28.025
Oh, hell. Dang it, Face,

50:28.025 --> 50:30.157
I didn't literally mean
be their daddy.

50:33.117 --> 50:34.466
Uh-oh.

50:35.510 --> 50:37.686
Looks like someone
needs a spanking.

51:00.361 --> 51:03.756
Watch out, ladies, he's about
to put you in time-out!

51:04.365 --> 51:05.975
Shit!

51:07.412 --> 51:09.631
<i> And even though
my son's new path</i>

51:09.631 --> 51:12.199
<i>was drifting away
from one of his passions,</i>

51:12.199 --> 51:14.114
<i>Merlin never let his journey</i>

51:14.114 --> 51:16.551
<i>take him too far away
from the other,</i>

51:16.551 --> 51:18.118
<i>Robin.</i>

51:18.118 --> 51:19.467
<i>Quick, turn on your TV!</i>

51:19.467 --> 51:21.469
<i>A Different World marathon
is on right now.</i>

51:21.469 --> 51:24.081
Remember how your mom would let
us watch reruns with her

51:24.081 --> 51:25.473
when we were kids?

51:25.473 --> 51:27.867
You know I'm watching it
already!

51:27.867 --> 51:29.303
Dwayne Wayne's about
to crash the wedding,

51:29.303 --> 51:30.304
it's about to go down!

51:30.304 --> 51:31.392
I know.

51:34.700 --> 51:36.745
<i>You do know he's
the bad guy, right?</i>

51:37.137 --> 51:38.747
Byron was going to be like Obama

51:38.747 --> 51:40.140
and Whitley could
have been his Michelle.

51:40.140 --> 51:42.142
Robin, you can't be serious
right now.

51:42.142 --> 51:43.578
He's literally saving her.

51:43.578 --> 51:45.406
Whitley is Dwayne's true love.

51:45.406 --> 51:47.756
Yet he waits for
the last second to speak up?

51:47.756 --> 51:49.932
<i>He should have left her
with Olivia Pope's daddy</i>

51:49.932 --> 51:51.108
<i>and sat down.</i>

51:51.108 --> 51:52.848
Yeah, all right.

51:52.848 --> 51:55.112
All right, it's about
to go down.

51:55.547 --> 51:58.071
<i>Whitley, I love you,
and if you'll have me,</i>

51:58.071 --> 52:00.552
<i>I want you to be my wife.
- What the hell are you doing?</i>

52:00.552 --> 52:01.944
<i>Hey, I'm sorry, Byron,
I love her!</i>

52:01.944 --> 52:03.511
<i>Die! Yes, die!</i>

52:03.511 --> 52:05.513
<i>- Let him go, man!
- Will you have me, Dwayne,</i>

52:05.513 --> 52:07.907
<i>as your lawfully wedded husband
from this day forth,</i>

52:07.907 --> 52:10.431
<i>to have and to hold
in richer, for poorer?</i>

52:10.431 --> 52:12.955
<i>Baby, please? Please?</i>

52:12.955 --> 52:14.392
<i>I do!</i>

52:17.612 --> 52:20.137
It's iconic, Robin.
It's iconic!

52:20.528 --> 52:21.747
<i>It gets me every time.</i>

52:22.182 --> 52:25.185
See? Dwayne is the true hero.

52:25.185 --> 52:27.666
Nope, still the bad guy.

52:27.666 --> 52:29.058
<i>What if somebody
wanted to stop you</i>

52:29.058 --> 52:30.234
<i>from marrying the wrong person?</i>

52:30.234 --> 52:32.323
I'd hope he'd have
the courage to do it

52:32.323 --> 52:33.933
before my damn wedding day.

52:33.933 --> 52:36.718
<i>This is real life,
not a TV show.</i>

52:37.197 --> 52:38.677
Yeah...

52:39.982 --> 52:41.854
I guess it is a different world.

52:43.812 --> 52:46.337
<i>Is anybody
getting married here today?</i>

52:46.337 --> 52:47.990
<i>Oh, hey, hey!</i>

52:47.990 --> 52:51.559
Hey, Slim Sexy.
You ready for your big night?

52:53.170 --> 52:55.650
Look, man, I'm not sure.

52:55.650 --> 52:59.219
Look, yesterday, those ladies
were way more handsy

52:59.219 --> 53:01.569
than even in our day!
- Yes, they were.

53:01.569 --> 53:02.962
They got me pacing
back and forth

53:02.962 --> 53:04.572
talking to the Lord right now!

53:04.572 --> 53:07.445
Look, look, I want to help Rita,
believe me.

53:07.445 --> 53:10.709
But I love my wife, man.
I can't be in no room

53:10.709 --> 53:14.930
playing grab ass with a room
full of horny women like that!

53:14.930 --> 53:16.584
- Okay, okay!
- I'm missing my birthmark!

53:16.584 --> 53:18.586
Look, put it in your solo.

53:18.586 --> 53:20.414
All right, just pick a song.

53:20.414 --> 53:23.069
Pick a song that tells them
what to do.

53:23.069 --> 53:24.853
And, Luther, I'm sorry to
interrupt, I'm sorry Slim,

53:24.853 --> 53:26.159
but I asked you about the name,

53:26.159 --> 53:27.813
but you didn't tell me
if it was cool yet.

53:27.813 --> 53:29.206
Like, it sounded
good in my head,

53:29.206 --> 53:30.685
but I didn't know
if it was too much

53:30.685 --> 53:31.991
or if it was too...

53:33.122 --> 53:34.689
- Look.
- Nah.

53:35.777 --> 53:36.778
Nah!

53:38.302 --> 53:39.172
I'm a Chip?

53:41.000 --> 53:42.393
You a Chocolate Chip.

53:45.309 --> 53:48.486
You have anything mocha-brown
and sugar-sweet?

53:53.142 --> 53:56.058
Good choice.
It's the best in town.

53:56.058 --> 53:57.756
Eve!

53:57.756 --> 53:59.714
So, what are you doing here?
You're not in Pahrump?

53:59.714 --> 54:01.716
Are you doing some body work
here in Vegas?

54:01.716 --> 54:03.805
Yeah, you could say that.

54:03.805 --> 54:05.546
Well, I'm happy to see you.

54:05.546 --> 54:06.982
What are you doing here?

54:06.982 --> 54:09.158
I always stop in here
after I drop Amos off

54:09.158 --> 54:11.160
at our sister chapel
to teach Bible study.

54:14.425 --> 54:16.078
Hands off, ladies,

54:16.078 --> 54:18.342
Slim's about to take you
to church.

54:19.604 --> 54:21.519
Hallelujah.

54:24.609 --> 54:26.306
I hope I didn't give you
the wrong idea

54:26.306 --> 54:28.265
the last time we spoke.
- No!

54:28.656 --> 54:29.962
Amos and I are fine,

54:29.962 --> 54:32.486
I just think
we've lost that spark.

54:33.008 --> 54:34.706
Well, you can always
get that back.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.708
You know what they say
about a spark;

54:36.708 --> 54:39.624
it doesn't take much
to turn into a flame.

54:41.190 --> 54:43.236
Guess that depends on
who's lighting it.

54:46.326 --> 54:47.849
Do you like what you see?

54:47.849 --> 54:49.982
Yes, Lord.

54:50.461 --> 54:52.245
I'm talking about
the menu, silly.

54:52.245 --> 54:55.335
I was talking about the same
thing you were talking about!

54:55.335 --> 54:57.163
It's like we were reading
the same menu.

54:57.163 --> 54:58.904
- Exactly. Pie. Menu.
- It's weird.

54:59.687 --> 55:01.689
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

55:01.689 --> 55:03.691
Um...

55:04.953 --> 55:06.738
Um! Um!

55:08.479 --> 55:11.090
Forget church, this is heaven.

55:11.090 --> 55:14.311
Come on, a little cheating
ain't so bad. Little bit?

55:14.311 --> 55:17.401
No, I got to watch what I eat.

55:21.579 --> 55:24.973
Look at that big old handsome
block of chocolate.

55:28.237 --> 55:30.588
Whipped cream,
rainbow sprinkles,

55:30.588 --> 55:32.285
maraschino cherries!

55:32.285 --> 55:35.462
We're going to change your name
from Big Des to Big Diabetes!

55:39.336 --> 55:43.340
Yo, we're going to need some
more money to cover that body.

55:48.345 --> 55:49.694
Hey, baby.

55:49.694 --> 55:51.783
Ladies.

55:51.783 --> 55:53.524
You all ladies looking good.

55:53.524 --> 55:55.656
You all looking real good
out there.

55:55.656 --> 55:59.094
I'm Mr. Big,
and it has been 25 years

55:59.094 --> 56:00.226
since we've been on this stage.

56:00.226 --> 56:03.098
And I want to say,
it is so good,

56:03.098 --> 56:05.753
it is so good...

56:07.929 --> 56:09.322
...to be back on the strip!

56:12.020 --> 56:14.240
All right, well,
without further ado, ladies,

56:14.240 --> 56:16.503
I'm going to give you
what you all been waiting for,

56:16.503 --> 56:19.506
Mr. Black Magic!

56:36.610 --> 56:40.222
<i> And abracadabra!
Just like that, my Merlin...</i>

56:40.222 --> 56:42.007
<i>I mean, Black Magic,</i>

56:42.007 --> 56:43.922
<i>made all his fears disappear</i>

56:43.922 --> 56:47.578
<i>and kept his fans coming back
for more. For real!</i>

56:47.578 --> 56:50.232
<i>Them crazy ladies went lining
up every night</i>

56:50.232 --> 56:53.410
<i>hoping to get a look at what
my baby had up his sleeve.</i>

57:02.810 --> 57:04.899
Shake your booty!

57:07.293 --> 57:08.860
Oh, that's right,
the Chips are back

57:08.860 --> 57:10.122
and they've never been bigger.

57:27.008 --> 57:30.316
Hold on just a second.
Yeah, credit card, hold on.

57:37.105 --> 57:38.542
All right, there you go.

57:51.946 --> 57:54.079
But I don't want
any threesomes in the bathroom.

57:54.079 --> 57:55.297
The last time you did this,

57:55.297 --> 57:57.299
we needed a spackle knife
to take it off.

58:00.041 --> 58:01.042
<i> Hey, Merlin!</i>

58:01.042 --> 58:02.391
Hey, Robin, what's up?

58:02.391 --> 58:03.741
I have something to tell you,

58:03.741 --> 58:06.178
but it sounds super loud there.

58:06.178 --> 58:08.528
Oh, yeah, yeah, well,
I'm about to do a show.

58:08.528 --> 58:10.399
Wow, they sure do love magic!

58:10.399 --> 58:12.532
Magic is really big out here.

58:12.532 --> 58:14.142
<i> Show us your dick!</i>

58:14.926 --> 58:16.101
Wait, what was that?

58:16.101 --> 58:18.538
They said,
"Show us your tricks!"

58:18.538 --> 58:19.931
<i>I'm a magician.</i>

58:19.931 --> 58:21.585
They're actually
calling me now, Robin,

58:21.585 --> 58:23.108
<i>so I'm sorry!
We can talk later.</i>

58:23.108 --> 58:23.935
Wait, wait, Merlin...

58:23.935 --> 58:25.502
Okay. Bye, bye.

58:25.850 --> 58:26.807
Bye.

58:31.246 --> 58:34.641
I knew this shit would work.
I knew it would work! I knew it.

58:39.516 --> 58:41.256
What's that new move called?

58:41.256 --> 58:42.954
I call it the Apple Pie.

58:42.954 --> 58:44.695
I like that. Yeah.

58:48.437 --> 58:50.091
That's a nice ride.

58:50.091 --> 58:52.703
You working that white man
privilege stereotype.

58:52.703 --> 58:54.835
Stereotype?
Look who's talking, dude.

58:54.835 --> 58:56.489
You've got four kids
and a baby momma.

58:56.489 --> 58:57.838
Says the man
that wears blackface.

58:57.838 --> 58:59.057
Never painted my face.

58:59.057 --> 59:00.319
Says the man
that wears black ass!

59:00.319 --> 59:01.712
I only do it for the show,

59:01.712 --> 59:03.365
it's not like I walk around town
like that.

59:03.365 --> 59:05.106
Dude, there's nothing
you could say

59:05.106 --> 59:06.325
to convince me
that I'm privileged!

59:06.325 --> 59:08.066
Agreed. There's nothing else
to say.

59:08.066 --> 59:10.503
You ever heard of a place
called Duke's Diner?

59:11.852 --> 59:13.898
I got some of Eve's receipts.

59:13.898 --> 59:15.508
And I call over there,
and they says

59:15.508 --> 59:19.077
she's been having coffee
every week with her husband,

59:19.077 --> 59:20.774
but I've never been there
before!

59:20.774 --> 59:22.471
Maybe he's a friend.

59:22.471 --> 59:25.300
If there's a male friend
who has the audacity

59:25.300 --> 59:28.565
to take his ass over there
and sit with my wife

59:28.565 --> 59:30.436
and have coffee every damn week,

59:30.436 --> 59:32.786
he deserves an ass whooping!

59:33.482 --> 59:35.093
Come on, you're overreacting.

59:35.093 --> 59:36.747
Eve wouldn't do you like that, man,

59:36.747 --> 59:38.357
she's not that kind of woman!

59:39.358 --> 59:40.489
I don't know, man.

59:41.839 --> 59:43.710
The romance has cooled.

59:44.581 --> 59:46.191
And it's crazy,
because I'm out here

59:46.191 --> 59:47.932
shaking my ass for strangers,

59:47.932 --> 59:50.761
but I can't do it
with my own damn wife!

59:50.761 --> 59:52.632
I feel like a damn hypocrite!

59:52.632 --> 59:54.591
I may need to practice
what I preach.

59:54.591 --> 59:57.681
Maybe you should preach
what you practice.

59:57.681 --> 59:59.421
If you like shaking ass in
front of women,

59:59.421 --> 01:00:01.075
maybe you should do it
in front of your wife.

01:00:02.076 --> 01:00:04.383
If you don't,
somebody else will.

01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:06.907
And they ain't going to want
no coffee.

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:09.257
That's for damn sure.

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:11.608
They're going
to want that pussy.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:17.875
<i> So, as the Chips
blew up again,</i>

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:19.224
<i>word started to spread</i>

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:21.748
<i>and Rita got calls
for some big money gigs.</i>

01:00:21.748 --> 01:00:23.228
It's going to be worth it.

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:28.755
<i>So, Rita dug up some
old ass superhero costumes</i>

01:00:28.755 --> 01:00:31.671
<i>and booked Merlin and the guys
for a bachelorette party.</i>

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.810
All right, everyone!

01:00:43.117 --> 01:00:46.730
<i>And while my baby was
up there bumping and grinding,</i>

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.601
<i>they brought in
the bachelorette.</i>

01:00:48.601 --> 01:00:49.950
Night Man!

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.910
<i>And y'all never going
to guess who it was.</i>

01:00:52.910 --> 01:00:55.303
<i>Aw, shit, y'all already know!</i>

01:00:55.913 --> 01:00:58.698
Robin? Robin, oh sh...

01:00:58.698 --> 01:01:00.657
Oh my! Oh, it's so big!

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:03.355
I'm sorry, sir.

01:01:03.355 --> 01:01:06.053
It's fine,
it's fine, it's fine.

01:01:06.053 --> 01:01:08.316
Look, I'm sorry
to alarm you, ma'am.

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:11.058
Hey, wait one second,
Night Man.

01:01:11.885 --> 01:01:16.498
Come on, Gia! All I asked
for was spa time, massage,

01:01:16.498 --> 01:01:19.110
and to hang with my girls.
I mean, what is this?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:20.677
But we did all that, sweetie!

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.504
Now it's time to hang
with the guys.

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.115
When I mean hang, it's like...

01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:26.421
Okay, music, thank you!

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.690
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:44.265
Wait, where do I put this?

01:01:46.137 --> 01:01:48.792
Oh... Um...

01:01:51.272 --> 01:01:53.448
It's not like that...

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.850
Oh my God, I'm so random!

01:02:03.850 --> 01:02:05.896
Wait, what the hell?
Gia, what are you doing?

01:02:05.896 --> 01:02:07.375
You need to take these off!

01:02:07.375 --> 01:02:09.334
No, you two need
to get a room.

01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:11.379
You guys are
a regular dynamic duo.

01:02:11.379 --> 01:02:12.772
Okay? All right,

01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:14.905
I'm going to lock you in a room
until you get laid

01:02:14.905 --> 01:02:17.429
or we run out of stripper tips,
whoever comes first.

01:02:17.429 --> 01:02:18.604
Um, great.

01:02:25.916 --> 01:02:27.656
I'm sorry about all that.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:29.484
So, you have no keys, huh,
do you?

01:02:30.442 --> 01:02:33.488
I guess it's time for plan B.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:36.622
Oh, uh-uh! Sorry, we are not
having sex, no.

01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:40.017
No, no, no, no.
I just meant for the cuffs.

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:41.540
For the handcuffs.

01:02:41.540 --> 01:02:44.586
Do you happen to have
a bobby pin or...

01:02:44.586 --> 01:02:48.025
Oh, no. But I know where
we can find one.

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:52.246
I just thought you should know
Robin just left

01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:54.988
with one of
these stripper brothas.

01:02:54.988 --> 01:03:00.254
Damn, I can't believe
she would do me like that!

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.952
<i>Yeah, Rob's my girl,</i>

01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.998
but I would hate to see a good,
fine man like you get played.

01:03:05.694 --> 01:03:07.174
Good looking, I'm on it.

01:03:07.174 --> 01:03:08.480
Of course, B, any time!

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.438
You know I am here
for you for whatever...

01:03:10.438 --> 01:03:11.831
I'm on it, thank you,
good looking.

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.790
Literally what...

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:14.660
Blaze?

01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:17.489
I think we're in
this room right over here.

01:03:18.359 --> 01:03:20.666
- I'm Night Man!
- Right here.

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.931
Oh, nice place.

01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:27.586
- As soon as Gia said

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:28.892
she was giving me
a bachelorette party,

01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:30.328
I booked this room.

01:03:30.328 --> 01:03:32.069
I'm not into that kind
of thing. No offense!

01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:34.158
I just don't think
it's appropriate

01:03:34.158 --> 01:03:35.376
if you already found
the right guy.

01:03:35.376 --> 01:03:37.726
I see. Um...

01:03:37.726 --> 01:03:39.641
But are you sure
he's the right guy?

01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:42.470
Huh... Yeah!

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.081
I mean, he's handsome.

01:03:44.995 --> 01:03:46.910
His career is on fire.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.391
And everyone says I'd be crazy
not to marry him anyway.

01:03:50.391 --> 01:03:52.393
So, yeah.

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:56.397
But are you in love...

01:03:59.009 --> 01:04:00.314
...with him?

01:04:01.968 --> 01:04:05.276
What? Damn it!
I can't do this.

01:04:05.276 --> 01:04:07.234
Why don't you just
call it off?

01:04:08.192 --> 01:04:09.367
Um...

01:04:10.194 --> 01:04:14.111
No, the handcuffs.
I can't open them.

01:04:14.111 --> 01:04:15.590
The handcuffs.

01:04:17.462 --> 01:04:18.855
Silly Night Man!

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.074
911? There's an emergency.

01:04:21.074 --> 01:04:24.730
There's a young innocent woman
being taken advantage of

01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:26.340
by some strippers
in a hotel room.

01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:28.952
Did I mention that
they're all...

01:04:28.952 --> 01:04:29.996
Black?

01:04:29.996 --> 01:04:31.650
Yeah.

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:34.087
I'll take one of these.
Hold tight, hold tight.

01:04:36.176 --> 01:04:38.744
It's not my first time in cuffs.

01:04:38.744 --> 01:04:40.441
Right.

01:04:40.441 --> 01:04:42.182
Guess that's part of your job.

01:04:42.182 --> 01:04:44.054
Nice work. Thank you.

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:53.063
I want them to think
they got their money's worth.

01:04:53.063 --> 01:04:54.891
Can you stay a while
before you go?

01:04:57.850 --> 01:04:59.896
- Sure, sure.
- Thanks.

01:05:01.071 --> 01:05:03.464
- I can give you a hand.
- Yeah, I think I need that.

01:05:03.464 --> 01:05:04.465
Yeah, okay.

01:05:12.386 --> 01:05:14.040
You think Merlin's
all right, man?

01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.607
Oh, he's good, man.

01:05:15.607 --> 01:05:18.044
He's probably somewhere butt
naked with the bride-to-be!

01:05:18.044 --> 01:05:19.872
- He did leave his cape.
- I got it!

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:22.179
Why are they searching
the cars?

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:23.354
What?

01:05:23.354 --> 01:05:24.616
Why are they checking
inside the cars?

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:25.747
Can't be for us, right?

01:05:25.747 --> 01:05:27.488
We the only brothers out here.

01:05:27.488 --> 01:05:30.535
- Dr. X, you better drive.
- Why, it's your car?

01:05:30.535 --> 01:05:31.362
You're white.

01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:34.365
We all know the routine.

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:36.802
We all get in the back
and we all hide.

01:05:36.802 --> 01:05:38.369
Yeah, but what
are we hiding for?

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.761
We didn't do anything wrong.

01:05:39.761 --> 01:05:42.242
Come on, guys, I'm not scared
of the police.

01:05:42.242 --> 01:05:44.679
That's 'cause they're
not looking for you, Exy.

01:05:44.679 --> 01:05:46.290
Right.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:49.815
Help us out, X.
Drive the car.

01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:52.209
- I'm just saying.
- Son of a bitch!

01:05:52.209 --> 01:05:54.124
- What?
- It's you!

01:05:54.124 --> 01:05:56.996
You're the one who's been
going out with my wife!

01:05:58.128 --> 01:05:59.303
It's you!

01:05:59.303 --> 01:06:00.478
You dropped my fucking cigarette.

01:06:00.478 --> 01:06:02.306
No, you backstabbing bastard!

01:06:02.306 --> 01:06:05.396
- She likes pie!
- Guys, guys, chill out!

01:06:05.396 --> 01:06:07.615
It's him! He needs
to chill out!

01:06:07.615 --> 01:06:09.922
Tell that snake ass right there
to chill out!

01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.097
Somebody going down.

01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:12.925
According to your wife,
it ain't you!

01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:14.144
That's all I'm saying.

01:06:14.144 --> 01:06:15.232
What did you say?

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:17.060
I said, "According
to your wife..."

01:06:19.018 --> 01:06:21.020
God! Jesus Christ, Amos!

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:26.112
I'm going to snatch your beard
off your fucking face!

01:06:32.118 --> 01:06:33.641
Hello, Officer,
what's the problem?

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:36.383
Oh, just looking for some
thug male dancers.

01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:37.776
You are free to go.

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:41.258
Um, hold on, why did you
call them thugs?

01:06:41.258 --> 01:06:42.999
Because they fit
the description.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:45.218
Really?

01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.700
Just some ghetto stripper motherfuckers.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.311
I'll have you know, Officer,

01:06:51.311 --> 01:06:54.836
I am one of those
ghetto strippers...

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:56.099
motherfucker!

01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:58.710
Keystone cop, shit,
you got me fucked...

01:06:58.710 --> 01:07:00.581
Sorry, I'm sorry!

01:07:00.581 --> 01:07:02.496
My name is Dr. Alexander Pike,
I work at Memorial Health.

01:07:02.496 --> 01:07:03.758
I'm sorry, I'm insured!

01:07:03.758 --> 01:07:05.673
I give to the Policeman's Ball
every year!

01:07:06.065 --> 01:07:08.111
I guess you feel
pretty black now.

01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:10.983
- Hey, man, I never understood

01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.767
all this shit you guys
go through every day

01:07:12.767 --> 01:07:14.682
that I don't have
to worry about.

01:07:14.682 --> 01:07:16.902
I'm really sorry.
- Don't be.

01:07:16.902 --> 01:07:18.773
You know what, it's just like
you said the first time;

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.297
we didn't do anything wrong.

01:07:20.297 --> 01:07:21.385
It's just how it is.

01:07:21.385 --> 01:07:22.951
You know what?

01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.605
I got an idea
to get us out of here.

01:07:25.911 --> 01:07:27.956
All right, do your thing,
Baby Jesus.

01:07:27.956 --> 01:07:30.307
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:31.873
- We're good!
- What are you doing?

01:07:31.873 --> 01:07:34.050
Officer, excuse me,
can I speak to you for a minute?

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:35.964
Slim, pray, pray for us, Slim.

01:07:35.964 --> 01:07:37.488
We going to jail.

01:07:37.488 --> 01:07:39.925
I got a thong on,
we going to jail.

01:07:39.925 --> 01:07:41.927
- We going to jail, bro.
- I got a thong...

01:07:41.927 --> 01:07:44.234
- Hey, you four are free to go.
- What?

01:07:45.235 --> 01:07:47.019
What did you show him
in your phone?

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.499
I showed him a picture
of Bambi,

01:07:48.499 --> 01:07:51.763
and then I offered him
a free boob job for his wife.

01:07:51.763 --> 01:07:55.027
I got to do it for free,
but now we're free!

01:07:55.027 --> 01:07:56.159
So...

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:57.334
All right, well, hey!

01:07:57.334 --> 01:07:59.771
Oh God, oh God!

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:01.903
He's talking to you.

01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:04.950
I am privileged! Oh God!

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:06.647
Well, you got the privilege
of driving now.

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.649
- Yeah.
- Least I could do.

01:08:17.658 --> 01:08:18.833
<i> Next thing you know,</i>

01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.574
<i>my son woke up
in a strange bed,</i>

01:08:20.574 --> 01:08:22.141
<i>unsure where he was,</i>

01:08:22.141 --> 01:08:25.144
<i>wearing a mask
and some torn leopard panties.</i>

01:08:25.144 --> 01:08:27.146
<i>But we all been there,
am I right?</i>

01:08:27.146 --> 01:08:29.148
Oh, just me?

01:08:37.156 --> 01:08:39.463
I'm Night Man. Night Man.

01:08:40.986 --> 01:08:43.031
I can't go out there like this.

01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:48.689
<i>A stripper
in a superhero outfit?</i>

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:50.169
I can't believe
you just let them run off.

01:08:50.169 --> 01:08:51.692
I didn't know she
had another room!

01:08:51.692 --> 01:08:53.216
And what's up with security?

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.305
When I called, they treated it
like it was some big joke.

01:08:55.305 --> 01:08:57.176
Okay, well, you do have
a prank show, B.

01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:01.354
Hold on!

01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:04.401
Well, look who has
their own room.

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:07.273
So what? I just needed
to be alone. I mean...

01:09:07.273 --> 01:09:09.362
And... are you?

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:11.843
Alone?
- What?

01:09:11.843 --> 01:09:14.150
Of course I'm alone, I swear!

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:15.716
Why would you ever
think otherwise?

01:09:15.716 --> 01:09:17.327
Good morning, guys,
welcome to Vegas!

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:18.371
What?

01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:19.503
Yo...

01:09:19.503 --> 01:09:20.982
Why is the clown in your room?

01:09:20.982 --> 01:09:21.983
Magician!

01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.637
Why are you in my room?

01:09:23.637 --> 01:09:25.509
Well, momma said that
you were out here,

01:09:25.509 --> 01:09:28.686
so I asked the maid to let me in
to surprise you!

01:09:28.686 --> 01:09:31.863
Okay, then what's up with
the outfit, Mervin?

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.081
It's Merlin.

01:09:33.952 --> 01:09:36.476
And a charity magic show
at the hospital.

01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:40.741
The kids love The King,
so I'm Black Elvis.

01:09:40.741 --> 01:09:42.961
Blelvis!
- You satisfied?

01:09:42.961 --> 01:09:46.182
How is this going to work
if we don't have trust, Blaze?

01:09:46.573 --> 01:09:47.792
Not cool, Blaze.

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.228
That's really not cool, man.

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:53.014
Anyway, if you don't mind,

01:09:53.014 --> 01:09:55.016
I just came to take
my old friend out on the town.

01:09:55.016 --> 01:09:57.932
Yeah, I don't think so,
because we got other plans.

01:09:57.932 --> 01:10:00.544
Right, baby? We got other plans.
- No, not anymore.

01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:03.416
I think I'd rather go be
with someone who truly knows me.

01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:04.852
Okay, it's like that?

01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:07.420
It's like that,
so I should just...

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.900
I should leave then, huh?

01:10:09.422 --> 01:10:11.729
All right. Let's go.

01:10:11.729 --> 01:10:13.078
- Oh, yeah. Okay.
- Let's go.

01:10:14.688 --> 01:10:16.473
He's an asshole sometimes.

01:10:16.473 --> 01:10:19.258
I know. Yeah,
I sense it, I sense it.

01:10:21.782 --> 01:10:25.308
Hey, man, that's my sign!
Don't worry about the door.

01:10:25.308 --> 01:10:28.441
First room service,
now a limo. How do you do it?

01:10:28.441 --> 01:10:30.182
A magician never reveals
his tricks.

01:10:30.182 --> 01:10:33.707
Hey, man! Hey, man,
that's my suit, that's my car!

01:10:33.707 --> 01:10:34.926
Blelvis has left the building!

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:37.233
Drive, drive, sir, please!

01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:40.236
So, you said
he was the only one

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.976
in and out of Robin's room
all night?

01:10:42.977 --> 01:10:45.458
Whoa, so the clown
is the stripper?

01:10:46.198 --> 01:10:47.852
Humpty is hung!

01:10:49.506 --> 01:10:51.290
And he's playing my girl
for a fool.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:52.813
I better text her.

01:10:52.813 --> 01:10:54.162
Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:55.903
I know a better way

01:10:55.903 --> 01:10:57.688
you and I could show her
who's the real fool.

01:10:58.515 --> 01:11:00.386
So, when can I see
your magic show?

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:02.345
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:11:02.345 --> 01:11:04.085
So, this is actually
my week off.

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:06.174
But this trip isn't about me,

01:11:06.174 --> 01:11:08.655
it's about you and
your bachelorette party.

01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.005
Not really. This trip
is about Blaze.

01:11:11.005 --> 01:11:12.746
We came to see Blaze's
first comedy show.

01:11:12.746 --> 01:11:15.793
He's been blowing up ever since
he announced our engagement.

01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:17.055
But are you, um...

01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:18.448
Are you ready to marry him?

01:11:20.145 --> 01:11:22.278
I have to be.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.583
He made a deal

01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:25.150
to livestream the wedding online
as a big event.

01:11:25.933 --> 01:11:27.195
Blaze's dream wedding.

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:29.023
Wait, you're livestreaming
your wedding?

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:30.329
Yeah.

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:31.983
That does not sound like
your dream wedding!

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:34.594
I pictured your wedding
as something smaller,

01:11:34.594 --> 01:11:36.857
just people you know
and a little less planned.

01:11:36.857 --> 01:11:38.990
More free, like you and...

01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:42.385
Damn, that does sound like me.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:45.388
But the publicity helps him,
so it's all good.

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:48.304
I just wish he knew me
like you do, you know?

01:11:48.826 --> 01:11:51.916
For the wedding, he wants me
to wear my hair straight.

01:11:51.916 --> 01:11:54.266
But I don't know,
I'd rather go natural.

01:11:54.266 --> 01:11:57.443
He's buying me a Chanel gown, yeah.

01:11:57.443 --> 01:12:00.533
But I prefer something simple. He...

01:12:01.969 --> 01:12:04.711
He literally wants trap music
for our first dance.

01:12:05.364 --> 01:12:06.452
I mean, really?

01:12:06.452 --> 01:12:08.498
Why don't you just
tell him that?

01:12:08.498 --> 01:12:09.760
Don't you want him to know?

01:12:10.326 --> 01:12:13.067
I want him to want to know.
You know?

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:16.767
Like I just try to be positive,
one day he will.

01:12:16.767 --> 01:12:18.551
How do you do that?

01:12:19.204 --> 01:12:20.727
No, seriously,
ever since we were kids,

01:12:20.727 --> 01:12:22.468
I ain't ever seen you mad.

01:12:23.077 --> 01:12:24.340
Why bother?

01:12:24.992 --> 01:12:27.473
If I trust you,
I can't be mad at you.

01:12:28.474 --> 01:12:32.043
And if I don't trust you,
why are we even together?

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:36.221
<i> But just as
Robin was wondering</i>

01:12:36.221 --> 01:12:38.615
<i>if her fiancé
really had her back,</i>

01:12:38.615 --> 01:12:41.661
<i>turns out it was Merlin
who needed to cover his ass.</i>

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.664
- There's my Robin.
- Hey, babe.

01:12:44.664 --> 01:12:47.145
I'm sorry about what happened
this morning. I just...

01:12:47.145 --> 01:12:48.712
The thought of you being
with another man,

01:12:48.712 --> 01:12:49.713
it just drives me crazy.

01:12:49.713 --> 01:12:50.931
Blaze,
don't even trip, man,

01:12:50.931 --> 01:12:52.324
we're just friends.
- Yeah, no, no,

01:12:52.324 --> 01:12:53.847
I wasn't talking about you, Melvin.

01:12:53.847 --> 01:12:55.458
I was talking about someone
who could be competition.

01:12:55.458 --> 01:13:01.028
But listen, my warm-up comic
dropped out of my show tomorrow,

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.378
and I need a new act.

01:13:03.074 --> 01:13:04.641
What?

01:13:04.641 --> 01:13:06.207
You want me to be...

01:13:06.207 --> 01:13:07.470
Tomorrow, do my magic act?

01:13:07.905 --> 01:13:10.603
Yeah. You don't do
another act, do you?

01:13:10.603 --> 01:13:12.692
- No, man, of course not!
- So, you're free?

01:13:12.692 --> 01:13:15.782
- I'm all free, man, thank you!
- I appreciate you, bro.

01:13:15.782 --> 01:13:18.263
I want to catch up with my girl,
but bring your A-game tomorrow.

01:13:18.263 --> 01:13:19.525
No problem, Mr. Blaze, sir.

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:20.570
I'll be there early, too.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.093
Congrats. Congrats, Merlin!

01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:24.008
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:26.271
Yo, can I get some of
this Bulleit bourbon, please?

01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:27.577
Man!

01:13:27.968 --> 01:13:29.448
Thank you.

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:30.667
Um!

01:13:34.453 --> 01:13:36.977
Okay, you heard Merlin.

01:13:36.977 --> 01:13:38.283
This is a huge shot for him

01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.198
that could lead to a lot
of really big things.

01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:43.810
And it could also be
the end of the Chips.

01:13:43.810 --> 01:13:46.030
So, I say, fellas,
we go out there tonight,

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.075
perform like it's our last show.

01:13:48.075 --> 01:13:49.642
Hey, let's go out
with a bang, guys.

01:13:49.642 --> 01:13:52.210
Bang, bang!
- Bang!

01:13:52.210 --> 01:13:55.256
Wait, guys, so...
Where's Luther at?

01:13:56.083 --> 01:13:59.217
Honestly, he wasn't too happy
when he heard

01:13:59.217 --> 01:14:01.262
that the Chips might be
breaking up again.

01:14:01.785 --> 01:14:03.700
Oh, look, guys,
let's wrap this up,

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.180
because I got a private show
with a lady.

01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:07.791
Oh!

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.314
Okay, all right!

01:14:09.314 --> 01:14:10.794
Let me get the room, okay?

01:14:10.794 --> 01:14:12.404
All right, guess we better go.

01:14:12.404 --> 01:14:15.276
Mr. X here a lot of time
to put on that spray tan.

01:14:16.843 --> 01:14:19.629
Nope, not anymore.
I threw all that stuff out.

01:14:19.629 --> 01:14:22.545
From now on, I'm 100 % me.

01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:25.199
What about
stuffing your crotch?

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.331
Okay, 95 %.

01:14:26.331 --> 01:14:27.767
I've got to keep
the schlong, man.

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.508
Got to keep a big schlong,
you know?

01:14:29.508 --> 01:14:30.553
Get out of here, man!

01:14:30.553 --> 01:14:32.555
- Dr. X!
- Yeah.

01:14:32.555 --> 01:14:35.471
Get them, kid. Oh, man!

01:14:36.384 --> 01:14:38.909
Put on something sexy,
a little...

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:41.346
...thong-thong.

01:14:41.346 --> 01:14:44.784
Wow, this should
be a good night.

01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:50.137
We ought to dim these lights,
give it the right setting.

01:14:51.399 --> 01:14:53.358
Cookie Club!

01:14:53.967 --> 01:14:55.882
Going to miss the guys
being together.

01:14:55.882 --> 01:14:58.145
Cookie Club in pink.

01:14:58.145 --> 01:14:59.669
Back at it again.

01:14:59.669 --> 01:15:01.801
Some things never change.

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:04.108
Know what'd be a good
color to put this in?

01:15:04.108 --> 01:15:06.023
Black and blue.
- Black and blue?

01:15:06.023 --> 01:15:07.807
Yeah, uh-huh.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.461
What's up with that, huh?

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.115
You think I'm a bitch
or something?

01:15:11.115 --> 01:15:13.944
You think I'm going to sit here
while you seduce my wife?

01:15:13.944 --> 01:15:15.728
You think that's going
to happen, Playboy?

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:19.079
First of all, I wasn't trying
to seduce your wife, okay?

01:15:19.079 --> 01:15:22.387
I set up your solo

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:24.563
so she could see you dance.

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:28.001
She... loves you, okay?

01:15:33.354 --> 01:15:35.182
Tired, ain't you?

01:15:40.274 --> 01:15:43.408
I want you to share
the spirit that you have

01:15:43.408 --> 01:15:45.715
with these other women
with your wife, man!

01:15:45.715 --> 01:15:48.239
When I was choking you...

01:15:48.239 --> 01:15:49.153
did you feel anything?

01:15:49.153 --> 01:15:50.458
No.

01:15:50.807 --> 01:15:51.764
Boop!

01:15:56.813 --> 01:15:58.336
Desmond, I came as you asked,

01:15:58.336 --> 01:15:59.642
but I think you got
the wrong impression.

01:15:59.642 --> 01:16:01.992
I love my husband
very, very much.

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.604
And your husband loves you.

01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:07.345
Amos, what...

01:16:08.955 --> 01:16:09.956
Do you work here?

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:12.655
Yeah.

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.875
We've been helping Rita out
with the hotel.

01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:18.051
But the truth is,

01:16:18.051 --> 01:16:21.054
a part of me was gone
and I had to find it.

01:16:22.447 --> 01:16:26.886
Look, now, I know you're upset,
but I needed an outlet.

01:16:29.323 --> 01:16:30.586
Yeah.

01:16:32.239 --> 01:16:33.458
I'm sorry.

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:37.375
I'm not upset
at what you're doing!

01:16:37.375 --> 01:16:39.507
I'm upset at who
you're doing it for.

01:16:40.508 --> 01:16:41.814
It should be me.

01:16:42.685 --> 01:16:44.425
I didn't think
that's what you wanted.

01:16:45.252 --> 01:16:47.515
You're a virtuous woman, Eve.

01:16:47.515 --> 01:16:49.039
I ain't a nun!

01:16:49.039 --> 01:16:51.215
All you had to do was ask.

01:16:51.215 --> 01:16:53.609
Whatever it is
you've been looking for,

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.611
you can share it with me!

01:16:59.310 --> 01:17:00.616
So...

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.140
...what do we do now?

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:10.060
I said,
"Share it with me, damn it!"

01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:11.452
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:13.672
I just happen
to have an opening.

01:17:15.674 --> 01:17:17.807
DJ, how about a little
something?

01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:19.765
I got you, Slim!

01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:21.288
Oh...

01:17:22.246 --> 01:17:23.551
Oh!

01:17:24.596 --> 01:17:25.641
Come on!

01:17:27.077 --> 01:17:28.121
Oh, oh!

01:17:28.905 --> 01:17:30.080
Pray for me.

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.908
That's a good thing you did, Des.

01:17:32.604 --> 01:17:34.519
Yeah, I guess I'm just
a regular old saint.

01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:38.088
Good looking out for me, too.
I see you called my wife.

01:17:39.393 --> 01:17:41.613
Come on, give me
some big brown sugar!

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.225
I didn't call your wife.

01:17:45.225 --> 01:17:48.315
Listen, it doesn't matter
who she came for.

01:17:48.315 --> 01:17:51.231
All that matters is
who she's going home with.

01:17:51.231 --> 01:17:54.408
Now, go out there and give her
a reason to want to go home.

01:17:54.931 --> 01:17:56.889
Easy for you guys to say,
you both got brown sugar!

01:17:56.889 --> 01:18:00.240
Come on, this brown sugar,
white sugar, it's just sugar!

01:18:02.939 --> 01:18:04.897
I'm about to put her
in a diabetic coma!

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:13.514
Ladies, I hope you all are
ready for some white chocolate!

01:18:40.977 --> 01:18:44.371
Go, white boy, go,
white boy, go!

01:18:47.157 --> 01:18:49.115
Guess whose credit score
just went up?

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.050
Uh-uh, girls, put your money
back in your purses.

01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:12.878
That there is my man!

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:39.035
All right, all right,
all right.

01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:42.821
Now a man with something big
in front of him.

01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:47.086
No, not that.
I'm talking about his future.

01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:51.134
Yes, coming to the stage for
his final performance

01:19:51.134 --> 01:19:52.700
with the Chocolate Chips...

01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.398
Jesus!

01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.966
Mister...

01:19:56.966 --> 01:19:58.750
Mr. Black Magic.

01:20:09.848 --> 01:20:13.286
Shake those jewels, baby,
the crown jewels!

01:20:13.286 --> 01:20:15.245
Oh, God!

01:20:36.266 --> 01:20:40.574
Go, Mr. Black Magic, go!
Go, Mr. Black Magic, go!

01:20:40.574 --> 01:20:42.663
Go, Mr. Black Magic, go!

01:20:46.885 --> 01:20:48.931
<i> So, as my baby gave
his last dance</i>

01:20:48.931 --> 01:20:50.628
<i>with the Chocolate Chips,</i>

01:20:50.628 --> 01:20:52.717
<i>it was clear that
he had finally learned</i>

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.632
<i>how to do things his way.</i>

01:20:57.243 --> 01:20:59.985
<i>Like I've been telling him
all his life,</i>

01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:02.901
<i>you have to decide if you are
going to go big or go home.</i>

01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.468
Shake 'em, shake 'em,
shake 'em!

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:09.168
<i>And for Merlin,
there was only one choice.</i>

01:21:10.213 --> 01:21:11.649
<i>Go big!</i>

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:34.759
Wow!

01:21:36.761 --> 01:21:38.328
Haven't been this excited
for your show

01:21:38.328 --> 01:21:39.372
since I was your assistant.

01:21:39.372 --> 01:21:42.680
Yo, me too! Man!

01:21:43.811 --> 01:21:45.988
God, I just hope
I don't blow it.

01:21:45.988 --> 01:21:47.685
Now, Merlin, stop.

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:49.817
You know what I'm going to say.
- What?

01:21:49.817 --> 01:21:51.558
Clearly you can do this.

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:54.344
You believe me, don't you?

01:21:56.346 --> 01:21:57.913
I do.

01:21:59.305 --> 01:22:01.003
Oh my fucking...
Everything is so unprofessional.

01:22:01.003 --> 01:22:03.570
You all, can I have the stage?
- Hey, babe.

01:22:03.570 --> 01:22:05.790
Babe, I do love you,
but I need y'all to leave.

01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:06.965
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:22:06.965 --> 01:22:08.706
- So that I can rehearse.
- See you.

01:22:08.706 --> 01:22:10.055
Okay, I'll catch you
later, babe.

01:22:10.055 --> 01:22:11.970
Blaze? Sorry, I know
you're kind of busy.

01:22:11.970 --> 01:22:13.972
But I just wanted to say thank
you again

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:15.539
for looking out for me.
- Yeah.

01:22:15.539 --> 01:22:17.976
And I just wanted
to return the favor

01:22:17.976 --> 01:22:19.978
by looking out for you,
so listen, okay.

01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:22.372
So, about that wedding
you're planning.

01:22:22.372 --> 01:22:24.026
Robin not feeling it.
- She told you that?

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:25.636
How do you know that?
- I just know her.

01:22:25.636 --> 01:22:27.768
And she's not into all the hype,
you know what I mean?

01:22:27.768 --> 01:22:30.293
Like, she's all about small and...

01:22:30.293 --> 01:22:31.859
- Small.
- ...personal at her wedding.

01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:34.036
And, dude, about the designer
gowns and all that stuff?

01:22:34.036 --> 01:22:35.951
She's not really into it,
it don't really float her boat.

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:38.518
Go more like, cultural.
- Cultural.

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:40.346
Cultural. I'm telling you,
it's the move, it's the move.

01:22:40.346 --> 01:22:41.957
That's the move. All right.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:44.002
And she really prefers
old school R&B over trap music.

01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:46.352
Yeah, good looking out.

01:22:46.352 --> 01:22:47.963
Good looking out,
I'll keep that in mind.

01:22:51.575 --> 01:22:53.707
<i> Finally,
my baby's big night.</i>

01:22:53.707 --> 01:22:56.362
<i>I even flew my ass in
to see Merlin shine.</i>

01:22:56.362 --> 01:22:58.364
<i>And he was ready
to leave stripper life,</i>

01:22:58.364 --> 01:23:02.020
<i>but he still had another
big dick to deal with.</i>

01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.500
What's up, y'all?
You all know me.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.676
You just got Blazed,
you know me.

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:07.808
Blazed.

01:23:08.287 --> 01:23:10.898
Welcome to Blaze's house,
y'all.

01:23:13.162 --> 01:23:15.729
And when you're in my house,
it's all about fun, okay?

01:23:15.729 --> 01:23:18.036
So, I have a special treat
for you tonight.

01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:19.298
A special treat!

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:20.473
I want to introduce you

01:23:20.473 --> 01:23:23.824
to start the show off
to my main man,

01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:27.263
the Amazing Marlow!

01:23:27.263 --> 01:23:29.047
Come out here, Marlow.

01:23:30.483 --> 01:23:34.922
Did he just call him Marlow?
Internet jackass.

01:23:36.272 --> 01:23:37.490
His name is Merlin.

01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:38.665
Hey, what's up, everybody?

01:23:38.665 --> 01:23:40.189
- That's my baby.
- Is this thing on?

01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:44.062
Okay, so, it's actually
the Amazing Merlin.

01:23:44.062 --> 01:23:46.978
I'm actually here
to perform the art

01:23:46.978 --> 01:23:50.677
of presta-digitation!

01:23:50.677 --> 01:23:53.289
Hey, whoa, enough with
the big words, buddy, okay?

01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:55.682
But you're here, yes?
- Yeah.

01:23:55.682 --> 01:24:00.296
Because you have
an impressive gift, yes?

01:24:00.296 --> 01:24:02.733
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's quite impressive.

01:24:02.733 --> 01:24:04.517
But let me just tell you
a little backstory.

01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:06.693
It's always been a big part
of me since I was a kid

01:24:06.693 --> 01:24:10.871
and it just kind of kept
growing as I got older.

01:24:10.871 --> 01:24:12.786
Wow, yeah, well,
yeah, yeah, that's crazy.

01:24:12.786 --> 01:24:15.920
Well, I'm glad
that you hung in there.

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.661
I've been hanging.

01:24:17.661 --> 01:24:19.315
Yeah, well, yeah, yeah,
'cause it's clear to see

01:24:19.315 --> 01:24:22.361
that you are
the total package.

01:24:22.361 --> 01:24:24.363
- That shit ain't funny.
- Come on, man.

01:24:24.363 --> 01:24:26.670
You're like a natural.
Like me.

01:24:26.670 --> 01:24:30.413
Like I consider myself like
the Michael Jordan of comedy.

01:24:30.413 --> 01:24:32.415
Whereas with you, I feel like

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:35.374
you're more of a Magic Johnson!

01:24:36.593 --> 01:24:39.117
That's literally
what I've been saying.

01:24:39.117 --> 01:24:41.859
I've been saying that
the whole time!

01:24:41.859 --> 01:24:43.513
My mom been telling me that,
too!

01:24:43.513 --> 01:24:45.297
Your mom told you that?
Your mom told you that.

01:24:45.297 --> 01:24:46.429
Well, look at the screens.

01:24:46.429 --> 01:24:47.952
Like, what do the screens
tell you?

01:24:48.735 --> 01:24:49.997
That's you, yeah?

01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:54.698
That's you, that's you, right?
Yeah?

01:24:58.919 --> 01:25:00.704
Oh my God.

01:25:00.704 --> 01:25:02.445
That's you, right?

01:25:04.142 --> 01:25:06.579
It looks like you, so.

01:25:13.064 --> 01:25:17.373
You just got Blazed!

01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:27.209
Did homie just trip
on his third leg?

01:25:28.601 --> 01:25:30.647
Lady and gentleman,

01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:33.911
it's time for us
to suit up. Come on!

01:25:38.394 --> 01:25:39.569
Merlin!

01:25:42.615 --> 01:25:45.140
You spent that whole night
with me and didn't tell me?

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.533
I don't believe this!

01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.415
I think he just did that.
I know you're not laughing.

01:25:59.806 --> 01:26:01.852
I know you're not laughing,
Mr. Narcos.

01:26:01.852 --> 01:26:04.333
You know what? You're kind
of like a knockoff Narcos.

01:26:04.333 --> 01:26:06.378
You probably put baking soda
in that shit?

01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:16.954
<i> After seeing
that video,</i>

01:26:16.954 --> 01:26:19.217
<i>I realized that my son
had a big secret</i>

01:26:19.217 --> 01:26:21.437
<i>he was too afraid to tell me.</i>

01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:24.222
<i>But it was hard for me
to be mad at him</i>

01:26:24.222 --> 01:26:26.790
<i>since I kept a big secret
from him too.</i>

01:26:27.312 --> 01:26:30.576
Merlin, you know I would
never judge you.

01:26:31.708 --> 01:26:33.362
Why didn't you tell me?

01:26:33.362 --> 01:26:35.146
I was tired
of being a big joke.

01:26:35.886 --> 01:26:37.322
I just wanted
to do things my way.

01:26:37.757 --> 01:26:39.063
But you did.

01:26:39.063 --> 01:26:40.804
You came to Vegas,
you pursued your dreams...

01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:43.198
Mom, but it's still
just a dream.

01:26:43.198 --> 01:26:44.808
Blaze exposed me in front
of everybody

01:26:44.808 --> 01:26:46.984
like a kid
at a talent show and...

01:26:46.984 --> 01:26:49.247
The point is;
I'm not a magician!

01:26:49.247 --> 01:26:50.988
Okay, I'm...

01:26:50.988 --> 01:26:52.119
It's just time to wake up.

01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:53.686
No, it's not!

01:26:53.686 --> 01:26:56.341
You have to see it if you're
going to achieve it, baby.

01:26:56.341 --> 01:26:57.734
Forget about him, he's a hater.

01:26:57.734 --> 01:26:59.257
Well, that's easy for you
to say.

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:01.259
I just lost the girl
and the job of my dreams.

01:27:01.259 --> 01:27:02.652
I can't see nothing good
about it.

01:27:02.652 --> 01:27:04.828
Hey, kid, you need to get back
on that stage

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:06.438
before this fool crash and burn.

01:27:06.438 --> 01:27:08.092
You can still save
this shit show!

01:27:08.092 --> 01:27:10.225
- Wait, for real?
- Yeah, come on!

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:12.488
Luther! Um!

01:27:12.488 --> 01:27:14.838
Good to see you again, baby.

01:27:14.838 --> 01:27:17.580
Verna? God damn, that's you?

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.059
How do y'all two know
each other?

01:27:20.409 --> 01:27:24.456
Well, the truth is me and
Luther used to get it in

01:27:24.456 --> 01:27:26.763
back in the day until
he fucked it all up.

01:27:26.763 --> 01:27:28.460
Well, that's because
you ran out on me

01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.767
when you caught me
with the waitress.

01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:32.812
Look, Verna, you had the flu,
it was...

01:27:32.812 --> 01:27:36.468
It wasn't the flu, stupid,
it was morning sickness!

01:27:36.468 --> 01:27:40.080
And don't try to blame me
for your cheating ass ways.

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.475
Merlin, I have something
I need to tell you.

01:27:44.824 --> 01:27:47.044
That's your daddy.
- What?

01:27:47.044 --> 01:27:50.047
Now, I sent you to Rita so
that you could find yourself

01:27:50.047 --> 01:27:53.137
and potentially find him,

01:27:53.137 --> 01:27:55.008
and you guys could meet
on your own terms.

01:27:55.008 --> 01:27:57.881
This is your son?
This is your boy?

01:27:57.881 --> 01:28:01.319
That's our son.
Happy Father's Day.

01:28:03.321 --> 01:28:05.367
You funny, mom, that's...

01:28:07.543 --> 01:28:09.327
You're being serious.
You're being serious?

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.677
Yes. But we don't have time
to talk about this right now.

01:28:11.677 --> 01:28:13.505
We do have time for it!
What the hell?

01:28:13.505 --> 01:28:15.028
Can I get a minute
to process this?

01:28:15.028 --> 01:28:17.074
I mean, I've been with this man
for a whole month,

01:28:17.074 --> 01:28:18.989
I don't even understand why...
- Merlin!

01:28:18.989 --> 01:28:20.295
It's time for you to get
on stage

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:21.470
and live out your dream.

01:28:21.470 --> 01:28:24.124
Now, go and do it your way.

01:28:24.124 --> 01:28:25.387
You can cuss me out later.

01:28:30.696 --> 01:28:32.698
- My way.
- Your way.

01:28:32.698 --> 01:28:35.310
Yeah, okay. Okay.

01:28:36.702 --> 01:28:37.964
All right.

01:28:37.964 --> 01:28:39.270
And make that magic.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:43.666
Okay.

01:28:45.276 --> 01:28:46.451
That's my boy?

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:49.280
That's your son.

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.195
Especially from the waist down.

01:28:56.505 --> 01:28:58.507
Give Drake his jacket back.

01:28:58.507 --> 01:29:00.204
- Hey, hey, what's up?
- I know Drake!

01:29:00.204 --> 01:29:01.988
No, no, he doesn't know Drake,
it's fine.

01:29:01.988 --> 01:29:04.295
Hey, I'm about to save the show.
I'm going to save the show.

01:29:04.295 --> 01:29:06.297
Hey, what's up, guys?

01:29:06.297 --> 01:29:08.560
I hope you remember me.
I'm the Amazing Merlin.

01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:09.953
And I'm going to perform a trick

01:29:09.953 --> 01:29:11.868
that I've never performed
in my entire life,

01:29:11.868 --> 01:29:14.479
and Blaze here is
my little assistant, okay?

01:29:14.479 --> 01:29:17.743
And basically, I'm going to
make him disappear! All right?

01:29:17.743 --> 01:29:19.615
So, I actually need
your guys' help,

01:29:19.615 --> 01:29:21.834
and on the count of three.

01:29:22.487 --> 01:29:24.402
One...

01:29:24.402 --> 01:29:26.230
two...

01:29:26.230 --> 01:29:27.144
three.

01:29:27.710 --> 01:29:29.886
Get the fuck out!

01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:32.976
Man...

01:29:34.281 --> 01:29:35.370
Yeah!

01:29:37.676 --> 01:29:40.810
All right, so, now that
that's out the way,

01:29:40.810 --> 01:29:42.725
I think it's time
to get some real magic.

01:29:42.725 --> 01:29:44.509
What you all think?
You all think that's cool?

01:29:46.642 --> 01:29:47.904
All right.

01:29:50.602 --> 01:29:52.474
<i> And just like that,
my baby performed</i>

01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:54.389
<i>his first Vegas magic show.</i>

01:29:54.824 --> 01:29:57.479
<i>Meanwhile, outside,
Blaze was about to get clowned.</i>

01:29:57.479 --> 01:29:59.045
Boim!

01:30:00.090 --> 01:30:01.352
Boim!

01:30:02.135 --> 01:30:02.919
Boink!

01:30:05.704 --> 01:30:07.314
Hey, look, guys,
I don't do free handouts.

01:30:07.314 --> 01:30:10.666
We don't want your money.
We just saw your act.

01:30:11.188 --> 01:30:13.190
Let me tell you, it sucked.

01:30:13.190 --> 01:30:16.019
I just wanted to come out here
and give you a joke.

01:30:16.019 --> 01:30:21.111
What did the bowling pin
say to the balls?

01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:22.852
I don't... I don't know.

01:30:22.852 --> 01:30:24.984
Welcome to the club!

01:30:26.551 --> 01:30:28.118
That's clown life, baby!

01:30:40.173 --> 01:30:42.828
<i> I'm telling you,
my baby was a star.</i>

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:46.179
<i>It was a night
he always dreamed of.</i>

01:30:46.179 --> 01:30:48.268
<i>Everybody was feeling the love!</i>

01:30:52.403 --> 01:30:54.579
<i>Well, everybody except Merlin.</i>

01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:58.191
<i>Because even though
he killed it onstage,</i>

01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:00.280
<i>he had lost Robin</i>

01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:02.195
<i>and found out who his dad
really was</i>

01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:03.501
<i>all in one night.</i>

01:31:05.503 --> 01:31:07.679
<i>So, the whole thing
was kind of bittersweet.</i>

01:31:10.290 --> 01:31:13.903
<i>And so, by the next morning,
he was just...</i>

01:31:13.903 --> 01:31:14.773
<i>bitter!</i>

01:31:22.520 --> 01:31:24.522
Let me guess;
it's for your migraines?

01:31:24.522 --> 01:31:26.611
No, I'm getting high.

01:31:26.611 --> 01:31:29.309
I invited the guys here
to celebrate.

01:31:29.309 --> 01:31:30.833
I'm selling the hotel.

01:31:30.833 --> 01:31:33.575
When my buyer saw us packing in
that house,

01:31:33.575 --> 01:31:35.185
they stopped lowballing me.

01:31:35.185 --> 01:31:37.317
I'm going to be
a rich old bitch!

01:31:38.841 --> 01:31:40.625
That's good, Miss Rita.
That's real good.

01:31:40.625 --> 01:31:43.019
I'm glad reviving the Chips
worked out for you,

01:31:43.019 --> 01:31:45.935
because it sure came back
to bite me in my ass.

01:31:45.935 --> 01:31:49.242
Yeah, I heard what happened.
I'm sorry.

01:31:49.242 --> 01:31:52.985
But I heard your magic show
kicked ass.

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.640
I also heard about
your little family reunion.

01:31:56.293 --> 01:31:57.903
You better go talk to Luther.

01:31:57.903 --> 01:32:00.210
You've been around him enough
to know that he's a good man.

01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:01.864
Yeah, he is.

01:32:03.735 --> 01:32:06.172
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

01:32:20.926 --> 01:32:23.320
<i> Hey, baby,
we need to talk.</i>

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.191
<i>I know you're hurting,
so don't shut me out.</i>

01:32:25.191 --> 01:32:26.584
<i>Okay, look...</i>

01:32:26.976 --> 01:32:28.630
Don't take it out
on your momma, Son.

01:32:29.021 --> 01:32:30.545
Oh, so, what, it's Son now?

01:32:30.545 --> 01:32:32.372
Okay, whatever
you want it to be, kid.

01:32:33.330 --> 01:32:36.638
Listen, I'm just saying don't
take it out on Verna, all right?

01:32:37.639 --> 01:32:39.597
I was wild when
we started dancing.

01:32:39.597 --> 01:32:42.426
The Chips started blowing
up and blew up quick!

01:32:42.426 --> 01:32:45.603
I mean, temptation
was everywhere.

01:32:45.603 --> 01:32:47.257
And I fell all in it.

01:32:49.172 --> 01:32:52.567
Your momma, she was, you know...
She got hurt and so she left me,

01:32:52.567 --> 01:32:54.917
took off to LA
I wanted to find her.

01:32:55.526 --> 01:32:58.311
I wanted to say, you know,
"Verna, give me another chance."

01:32:58.311 --> 01:32:59.574
- Yeah, sure you did.

01:32:59.574 --> 01:33:01.271
Oh, if I'm lying, I'm dying.

01:33:01.271 --> 01:33:02.707
Lookie here.

01:33:02.707 --> 01:33:04.013
I even got her a proper ring.

01:33:05.101 --> 01:33:06.842
She deserved it,

01:33:06.842 --> 01:33:09.801
and I wanted to make up
for my past mistakes.

01:33:09.801 --> 01:33:12.674
You know, I wrecked
my car and my leg, and...

01:33:13.936 --> 01:33:15.415
...it took a lot out of me.

01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:18.462
I mean, I was young and dumb.

01:33:19.942 --> 01:33:21.770
Well, age ain't made you
no smarter.

01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:26.644
Okay, I'll take that.
I'll take that.

01:33:26.644 --> 01:33:29.734
But who's being
the dumb one now?

01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:32.041
Hm?

01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:35.392
I know what a mistake it is
to lose the right woman.

01:33:36.132 --> 01:33:38.656
I just don't want that
to happen to you.

01:33:38.656 --> 01:33:41.224
So, you think I should chase
after Robin?

01:33:41.659 --> 01:33:43.443
Well, she ain't chasing
after you.

01:33:44.009 --> 01:33:46.316
<i> Merlin, there's a girl
in the Cookie Club</i>

01:33:46.316 --> 01:33:47.622
<i>here for you.</i>

01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:52.278
Don't be so sure
about that, Pops.

01:33:54.933 --> 01:33:56.848
Hey, hey, hey, guys.

01:33:56.848 --> 01:33:58.284
Uh, what's up?

01:33:58.284 --> 01:34:00.112
Is there like a girl here
or something, for me?

01:34:00.112 --> 01:34:01.461
Yep, right there.

01:34:05.727 --> 01:34:07.859
- Hi, Merlin.
- Hey, Gia.

01:34:07.859 --> 01:34:09.861
Look, I don't have
a lot of time,

01:34:09.861 --> 01:34:13.473
but I wanted to say I'm sorry
about last night.

01:34:14.605 --> 01:34:15.780
I took the video,

01:34:15.780 --> 01:34:18.261
but I didn't know
what he was up to.

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:21.699
You seem really nice,
and I know you care about Robin,

01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:25.660
so I felt like
you should know...

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:26.922
they're getting married today.

01:34:28.358 --> 01:34:30.534
Seems Blaze got it in his head

01:34:30.534 --> 01:34:32.579
to surprise her
with some resort wedding

01:34:32.579 --> 01:34:33.711
away from the strip.

01:34:34.973 --> 01:34:37.497
Unless someone wants
to speak up.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.283
So, what you going to do,
Mr. Magic?

01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:42.024
What you going to do?
- I don't know, Luther,

01:34:42.024 --> 01:34:43.199
I can't stop a wedding
by myself.

01:34:43.199 --> 01:34:44.156
Can't, can't, boy!

01:34:44.156 --> 01:34:45.418
I told you about
that word can't!

01:34:45.418 --> 01:34:46.419
There's no such thing.

01:34:46.419 --> 01:34:48.378
And you're not by yourself.

01:34:48.378 --> 01:34:50.554
Your brothers got your back.
Boop!

01:34:50.554 --> 01:34:51.729
All right, well, thanks, guys,

01:34:51.729 --> 01:34:52.948
but it's not like
we got invited.

01:34:52.948 --> 01:34:54.776
How are we going to get them
to let us in?

01:34:54.776 --> 01:34:58.301
I wonder;
have they hired a pastor yet?

01:34:58.301 --> 01:34:59.737
Yeah, it wasn't hard in Vegas.

01:34:59.737 --> 01:35:01.391
I'm about to confirm one
for Blaze now.

01:35:01.391 --> 01:35:04.829
Ah, ah, ah, baby girl!
You just found one!

01:35:04.829 --> 01:35:06.570
And a security team,

01:35:06.570 --> 01:35:08.877
like we used to do
for Luther's old routine.

01:35:08.877 --> 01:35:11.227
But only if Mr. Big is in.

01:35:11.227 --> 01:35:13.664
How about it?
Ready to get back on your feet?

01:35:13.664 --> 01:35:15.797
Huh? Well, it has been a long time

01:35:15.797 --> 01:35:17.581
since I've been out the game, so...

01:35:17.581 --> 01:35:20.279
Hell yeah, I'm in!
Let's go do what we do.

01:35:24.501 --> 01:35:26.198
Please just put that away, okay?

01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:28.113
I'm only coming to whatever
this surprise is

01:35:28.113 --> 01:35:31.116
because I feel bad you got
jumped by a motorcycle gang.

01:35:31.116 --> 01:35:33.031
I'm still mad at you for
what you did to Merlin.

01:35:33.031 --> 01:35:34.772
<i>Hey, it wasn't me who
lied to you, okay?</i>

01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:37.383
<i>Now, trust me,
you're going to love this!</i>

01:35:37.383 --> 01:35:40.082
Get in. After you. After you,
my love, come on.

01:35:40.082 --> 01:35:41.692
<i>She's going to love this.</i>

01:35:42.214 --> 01:35:43.259
It's going to be great!

01:35:45.783 --> 01:35:48.220
Mom, hey, hey, mom.
<i> You okay, baby?</i>

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.569
I'm riding back to the airport,

01:35:49.569 --> 01:35:51.136
but I can turn around
if you need me to.

01:35:51.136 --> 01:35:52.747
No, it's fine. And you know,

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:54.226
I can't even really talk
about that right now.

01:35:54.226 --> 01:35:55.924
The guys are waiting
for me outside.

01:35:55.924 --> 01:35:57.752
<i>But Robin is getting
married today...</i>

01:35:57.752 --> 01:36:02.147
and look, I'm thinking about
trying to stop it.

01:36:02.582 --> 01:36:03.888
What the hell, Merlin?

01:36:03.888 --> 01:36:06.238
Yeah, I know it sounds crazy,
right? I know.

01:36:07.022 --> 01:36:09.024
Ain't nothing crazy
about love.

01:36:09.502 --> 01:36:11.809
Hell, I've been feeling
a little crazy

01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:13.680
after seeing Luther last night.

01:36:14.072 --> 01:36:16.640
<i>We all need a little
crazy sometimes.</i>

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:18.555
Go get your girl.

01:36:19.295 --> 01:36:22.124
I will. Yeah, I will.
I will, mom.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:24.779
I love you.
I love you, thank you.

01:36:27.172 --> 01:36:28.217
Uh...

01:36:28.217 --> 01:36:30.393
Driver.
Can you pull over

01:36:30.393 --> 01:36:31.829
so I can change clothes?

01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:32.961
Close your eyes, though.

01:36:32.961 --> 01:36:34.440
You know what?

01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.920
You ain't got
to close your eyes.

01:36:38.096 --> 01:36:40.098
<i>So, Merlin texts me
the address</i>

01:36:40.098 --> 01:36:42.361
<i>and then got ready
to go get his girl back</i>

01:36:42.361 --> 01:36:45.060
<i>while Blaze had other plans.</i>

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:46.713
<i>But just like
I been telling y'all,</i>

01:36:46.713 --> 01:36:48.846
<i>plans don't always come true.</i>

01:36:48.846 --> 01:36:51.849
<i>Because it was
about to pop off!</i>

01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:53.808
- Oh my God!
- Mm-hmm!

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:57.289
- Blaze, what is this?
- Yep. Surprise.

01:36:57.289 --> 01:36:58.987
It's your dream wedding,
girl, right?

01:36:59.988 --> 01:37:01.467
Oh my God!

01:37:01.467 --> 01:37:03.513
This is a little more you,
you know what I mean?

01:37:03.513 --> 01:37:05.123
- Yeah.
- It's, like, intimate.

01:37:05.123 --> 01:37:08.300
I even had a gown
made by a local designer

01:37:08.300 --> 01:37:10.868
because I wanted to match
your spiritualness...

01:37:10.868 --> 01:37:12.609
- Oh my God!
- ...and your natural beauty.

01:37:12.609 --> 01:37:14.698
Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, it's...

01:37:14.698 --> 01:37:17.135
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:37:17.701 --> 01:37:19.007
Surprise.

01:37:19.007 --> 01:37:20.747
Blaze, I never knew
you knew me this well.

01:37:20.747 --> 01:37:22.837
Oh, I know you.
Hell, yeah.

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:24.403
Now all you gotta do
is get dressed,

01:37:24.403 --> 01:37:26.231
and walk down that aisle

01:37:26.231 --> 01:37:27.754
and say those two magic words.

01:37:27.754 --> 01:37:29.800
There's the dress. Look at that.

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:32.890
Gia! What are you doing here?
I am absolutely shocked!

01:37:32.890 --> 01:37:34.370
I need to take
a picture of that.

01:37:34.370 --> 01:37:35.762
This is beautiful!

01:37:35.762 --> 01:37:37.503
Oh, girl, you ain't seen
nothing yet.

01:37:37.503 --> 01:37:38.722
Let's go, come on.

01:37:38.722 --> 01:37:40.289
- Where are we going?
- To go get ready.

01:37:40.289 --> 01:37:41.551
I'm going to see
you later, baby.

01:37:41.551 --> 01:37:42.639
- Bye, babe!
- Yeah.

01:37:42.639 --> 01:37:43.553
Where are we going?

01:37:43.553 --> 01:37:44.641
Hey! Where's my suit at?

01:37:44.641 --> 01:37:45.860
You sure I look good?

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.774
This look good?
- You look great.

01:37:51.474 --> 01:37:52.867
Okay, um...

01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:56.218
I'm going to need some
time alone with Robin,

01:37:56.218 --> 01:37:58.176
but I can't get to her
with Blaze around.

01:37:58.176 --> 01:38:00.178
So, look, I'm going
to need a distraction.

01:38:00.178 --> 01:38:02.572
Listen, boy, the one thing the
Chips know how to do

01:38:02.572 --> 01:38:04.269
is distract people.

01:38:04.269 --> 01:38:06.489
Hell yeah, let's do it!
Look at us!

01:38:06.489 --> 01:38:08.752
We got on Luther's old outfits.

01:38:08.752 --> 01:38:10.406
And Luther's old music.

01:38:12.538 --> 01:38:14.671
Yeah, but do we get
the old Luther?

01:38:15.498 --> 01:38:18.109
Hell, yeah.
It's showtime, fellas.

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:21.504
Luther's back!

01:38:23.985 --> 01:38:26.204
Let them through,
please, okay?

01:38:26.204 --> 01:38:28.990
This is the Pastor and
the groom's personal security.

01:38:28.990 --> 01:38:30.469
Blaze is expecting them.

01:38:30.469 --> 01:38:32.384
That's all you have to say.
All right, let's go.

01:38:36.171 --> 01:38:37.476
Thank you.

01:38:38.608 --> 01:38:40.175
- We back.
- We back.

01:38:45.484 --> 01:38:47.095
You can do this, Robin.

01:38:47.095 --> 01:38:49.445
All you have to do is say
those two magic words.

01:38:50.968 --> 01:38:53.666
It's only magic if it's true.

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:57.453
Merlin?
What are you doing here?

01:38:57.453 --> 01:38:59.672
Look, I'm stopping you
from marrying the wrong guy.

01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:01.239
You're about to make
a big mistake, Robin.

01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:04.286
No, the only mistake I made
was believing you.

01:39:04.286 --> 01:39:05.809
Here I was doubting Blaze,

01:39:05.809 --> 01:39:07.811
but it turns out it's you
I can't trust.

01:39:07.811 --> 01:39:09.247
You can't trust me?

01:39:09.247 --> 01:39:11.510
Meanwhile, Blaze knew me
better all along.

01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:12.729
I mean, look at this wedding.

01:39:13.556 --> 01:39:15.166
No, he didn't.

01:39:18.561 --> 01:39:21.781
Where were you,
and why are you so hot?

01:39:21.781 --> 01:39:24.349
I'm cool, I'm cool!
Super cool.

01:39:24.349 --> 01:39:25.829
Yeah, but it's about
to get hotter.

01:39:25.829 --> 01:39:27.091
Well, hello. Hello.

01:39:28.179 --> 01:39:30.703
Hey, now. Hey, people.

01:39:31.704 --> 01:39:32.923
Who's this guy?

01:39:32.923 --> 01:39:35.926
Hold up. Hello, hello.

01:39:35.926 --> 01:39:37.710
- He's the pastor.
- This the person you hired?

01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:39.495
Yes, yeah, no, trust me,
he's huge in Vegas.

01:39:39.974 --> 01:39:42.454
Hello! Girl...

01:39:43.803 --> 01:39:45.936
He does not look
like a Pastor.

01:39:45.936 --> 01:39:47.982
Yeah, hey.

01:39:47.982 --> 01:39:50.506
Good people, we came together
today so that we can join

01:39:50.506 --> 01:39:52.943
two people who are destined
to be together.

01:39:53.509 --> 01:39:56.947
That's a love
that cannot be denied.

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.124
It's a beautiful thing,
it's a special thing.

01:40:00.124 --> 01:40:01.647
It's a special day.

01:40:01.647 --> 01:40:03.954
It's a special day for me,
it's a special day for her.

01:40:03.954 --> 01:40:05.477
It's a special day for him.

01:40:05.477 --> 01:40:07.610
It's a special day for you!

01:40:08.872 --> 01:40:10.004
It's a special day for humans!

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.701
- Amen!
- Amen!

01:40:11.701 --> 01:40:13.442
- Yeah!

01:40:14.269 --> 01:40:16.619
Yeah, because, you know,
make no mistake about it.

01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:19.100
I done made some big mistakes,
let me tell you.

01:40:19.100 --> 01:40:21.493
Let me tell you,
I lost the woman

01:40:21.493 --> 01:40:23.017
that I cared for the most.

01:40:23.887 --> 01:40:25.062
It's terrible when
you make a mistake

01:40:25.062 --> 01:40:26.281
and you lose your soulmate.

01:40:26.281 --> 01:40:29.240
If you got somebody
that you love,

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.850
hold on to them tight!

01:40:31.938 --> 01:40:33.288
Tight!

01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:36.552
You understand me?
Make sure you...

01:40:37.727 --> 01:40:40.034
Make sure you find somebody
that got your back.

01:40:40.773 --> 01:40:41.992
Yeah.

01:40:42.514 --> 01:40:44.690
Because when the chips are down,

01:40:44.690 --> 01:40:46.257
the Chips are never out.

01:40:46.257 --> 01:40:48.085
So, listen here, good people.

01:40:48.085 --> 01:40:49.826
When you find somebody,

01:40:49.826 --> 01:40:52.742
and if you're lucky enough
to find somebody that loves you,

01:40:52.742 --> 01:40:55.049
you better jump on it!

01:40:55.658 --> 01:40:56.963
Jump on it!

01:41:10.847 --> 01:41:12.892
I told him everything,
I told him what you like!

01:41:12.892 --> 01:41:14.938
This is me. This wedding is me.

01:41:14.938 --> 01:41:16.418
Wait...

01:41:16.418 --> 01:41:17.506
Wait, wait, wait.
So, you're saying

01:41:17.506 --> 01:41:19.377
all of this was your idea?
- Yes.

01:41:19.377 --> 01:41:21.118
- You told Blaze for me.
- Yes, Robin!

01:41:21.118 --> 01:41:22.554
So, who am I supposed
to marry, you?

01:41:22.554 --> 01:41:23.990
Yeah.

01:41:26.428 --> 01:41:29.387
It's not a damn TV show.
You got to go!

01:41:29.387 --> 01:41:31.128
So, I'm the bad guy now?

01:41:31.128 --> 01:41:33.913
How can I believe
anything you say anymore?

01:41:33.913 --> 01:41:35.741
I'm done, like,
I'm done with this. No, don't.

01:41:35.741 --> 01:41:37.787
Robin, come on.

01:41:39.745 --> 01:41:40.877
Robin.

01:41:50.016 --> 01:41:51.888
Can you stop?
Can you all stop?

01:41:51.888 --> 01:41:53.498
Can you all stop?
Can you stop this?

01:41:55.457 --> 01:41:57.328
Come on, Robin,
let me just talk to you!

01:41:57.328 --> 01:41:58.634
Son of a bitch!

01:42:07.773 --> 01:42:09.819
I don't even mean it
like that!

01:42:09.819 --> 01:42:11.473
Well, I did mean it
like that, but just...

01:42:11.473 --> 01:42:13.039
- Robin!
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:42:13.649 --> 01:42:15.868
Hey, Frank, film this.

01:42:15.868 --> 01:42:17.522
I'm about to kick
this motherfucker's ass.

01:42:17.522 --> 01:42:19.263
Get me in the shot, come on.

01:42:19.263 --> 01:42:20.569
I'm going to kick
this motherfucker's ass

01:42:20.569 --> 01:42:21.570
for crashing my wedding!

01:42:33.190 --> 01:42:35.714
You know how it is.
You remember?

01:42:39.805 --> 01:42:41.590
I got you smiling again.

01:42:43.069 --> 01:42:45.115
Why don't you tell her
who told you what she wanted?

01:42:45.115 --> 01:42:47.204
Man, shut, man, shut up.
Get this. Shut up, okay?

01:42:47.204 --> 01:42:49.293
No one's going to believe you,
because he's a clown, okay?

01:42:49.293 --> 01:42:52.253
I'm a clown. Who gives...
Yo, I'm a stripper, too.

01:42:52.253 --> 01:42:53.732
Hell, I'm even a liar!

01:42:53.732 --> 01:42:55.821
But you know what I'm not?
I'm not a fake!

01:42:55.821 --> 01:42:58.215
You don't love her like I do.
- I'm the one she's marrying.

01:42:58.215 --> 01:43:00.609
Boy, you got these cameras
going all the time.

01:43:00.609 --> 01:43:01.653
It's all just one big act!

01:43:01.653 --> 01:43:03.394
You about to hear my vows, bro.

01:43:03.394 --> 01:43:05.831
Wedding vows? Let me tell you
the wedding vows that I wrote.

01:43:05.831 --> 01:43:09.052
"Do you, Robin,
take me, Merlin...

01:43:09.052 --> 01:43:10.880
<i>to be my first kiss?</i>

01:43:11.663 --> 01:43:15.319
<i>To make magic with me,
to watch old tv shows together?</i>

01:43:15.319 --> 01:43:17.800
<i>To always make
each other laugh,</i>

01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:19.758
<i>to always have
each other's backs?"</i>

01:43:20.803 --> 01:43:23.371
See, because she is my Whitley.

01:43:23.371 --> 01:43:24.502
And I'm in love with her.

01:43:24.502 --> 01:43:26.156
I'm in love with you, too,
Merlin!

01:43:26.678 --> 01:43:27.810
Wait,
what did she just say?

01:43:30.639 --> 01:43:32.728
- Merlin.
- Did you mean it?

01:43:32.728 --> 01:43:34.208
Of course.

01:43:38.124 --> 01:43:42.216
I love you, Merlin, so much.
- Yeah, I know.

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:43.739
And unlike him...

01:43:43.739 --> 01:43:45.741
I was going to Blaze her
ass at the altar, anyway.

01:43:45.741 --> 01:43:48.700
...I know you.

01:43:52.791 --> 01:43:54.402
You know?

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:06.762
Will Robin marry Merlin?

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.635
I mean, is this what
you want, Merlin?

01:44:11.549 --> 01:44:13.203
I want a different world.

01:44:14.378 --> 01:44:15.640
Do you?

01:44:16.075 --> 01:44:17.251
I do.

01:44:18.687 --> 01:44:21.080
Wow, those words
really are magic.

01:44:22.734 --> 01:44:25.084
Well, then...

01:44:25.084 --> 01:44:29.132
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:31.526
You may kiss the bride.

01:44:38.707 --> 01:44:41.013
<i> See, just like
when I get a massage,</i>

01:44:41.013 --> 01:44:43.320
<i>my tale had a happy ending.</i>

01:44:43.320 --> 01:44:44.800
<i>Merlin got his girl,</i>

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:47.455
<i>somehow Robin magically
got my damn wedding ring</i>

01:44:47.455 --> 01:44:49.413
<i>with that little ass diamond,</i>

01:44:49.413 --> 01:44:51.154
<i>Luther finally got to be a dad,</i>

01:44:51.154 --> 01:44:52.808
<i>and we buried the hatchet.</i>

01:44:52.808 --> 01:44:56.681
<i>And by hatchet,
I mean his dick in my vagina!</i>

01:44:56.681 --> 01:44:58.030
We're going to go ahead

01:44:58.030 --> 01:44:59.597
and make you a little sister
or brother, okay?

01:44:59.597 --> 01:45:01.077
Momma, really?

01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:02.818
I got about four eggs left.

01:45:02.818 --> 01:45:03.949
I'm going to scramble
everything!

01:45:03.949 --> 01:45:06.996
So, husband,
are you retired now?

01:45:06.996 --> 01:45:09.346
From stripping?
Yeah, absolutely.

01:45:10.391 --> 01:45:12.044
What if I want you
to dance for me?

01:45:12.044 --> 01:45:13.437
What you mean, like...

01:45:13.437 --> 01:45:14.612
I mean, that can be arranged.

01:45:14.612 --> 01:45:15.918
Back in the hotel room, later?

01:45:15.918 --> 01:45:18.790
Uh-uh! Uh-uh!
What if I want it right now?

01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:20.618
- Right now?
- DJ!

01:45:21.358 --> 01:45:23.404
Robin, don't do this to me.

01:45:23.404 --> 01:45:26.145
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like
to bring to the stage right now

01:45:26.145 --> 01:45:31.107
Dr. X, Mr. Body, Mr. Face,

01:45:31.107 --> 01:45:34.632
Mr. Slim Sexy, Mr. Big,

01:45:34.632 --> 01:45:38.723
and the one and only
Mr. Black Magic!

01:45:38.723 --> 01:45:42.336
Ladies and gentlemen, I bring
to you the Chocolate Chips!

01:45:55.610 --> 01:45:57.307
<i> Like I said,
Merlin and Robin</i>

01:45:57.307 --> 01:46:00.092
<i>have been crazy about
each other from day one.</i>

01:46:00.092 --> 01:46:01.964
<i>So, while we get our dance on,</i>

01:46:01.964 --> 01:46:04.532
<i>it's time to let them get to
the best part of the wedding,</i>

01:46:04.532 --> 01:46:06.142
<i>the honeymoon!</i>

01:46:06.142 --> 01:46:08.405
<i>You all know I meant fucking,
right?</i>

01:46:08.405 --> 01:46:11.103
So, come on, here's to love.

01:46:11.103 --> 01:46:12.757
<i>Here's to the future.</i>

01:46:12.757 --> 01:46:14.455
<i>Here's to magic.</i>

01:46:20.156 --> 01:46:22.158
Raise your hand
if you fought a tiger.

01:46:26.597 --> 01:46:28.512
- Bam!
- Hit them with it.

01:46:28.512 --> 01:46:30.253
- Bam!
- Double it up.

01:46:30.253 --> 01:46:31.863
Who's talking? Who's talking?

01:46:34.779 --> 01:46:36.390
Well, come on in here.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:39.697
By the time you get in here,
I'll be on the stage butt naked.

01:46:46.617 --> 01:46:47.792
I heard it.

01:46:57.454 --> 01:47:00.501
Good living and good pussy.

01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:04.853
Stop messing around, Merlin.

01:47:04.853 --> 01:47:06.550
Okay. I'm not messing
around! I'm stuck.

01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:08.944
Oh, shit. Robin?

01:47:08.944 --> 01:47:09.858
Help!

01:47:12.817 --> 01:47:14.645
Amen, talk about the Lord!

01:47:18.301 --> 01:47:20.390
Get... wrong way!

01:47:21.957 --> 01:47:23.088
Cut!

01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:25.395
Yo, how do you open this door?

01:47:25.395 --> 01:47:26.527
Use your dick.

01:47:31.575 --> 01:47:33.664
Earl said, "Well, yeah,
I'm not where I should be."

01:47:33.664 --> 01:47:35.013
I said, "Don't show me,

01:47:35.013 --> 01:47:36.667
but if you could give me
an example."

01:47:36.667 --> 01:47:38.800
Well, Earl sent me
a goddamn cup!

01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.411
Yeah. So Earl's dealing
with a fucking sardine.

01:47:42.107 --> 01:47:44.414
Shake it, shake it,
shake it, shake it.

01:47:44.893 --> 01:47:48.200
Huh! Baby,
talk about the Lord!

01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:50.986
You see these calves?
Ladies love them.

01:47:50.986 --> 01:47:52.553
Can't get them at the gym.

01:47:52.553 --> 01:47:54.424
Literally you can't.
They're implants.

01:47:54.424 --> 01:47:56.557
Talking, who's talking?
I'm talking.

01:47:56.557 --> 01:47:58.602
Who's working?
I'm working.

01:47:58.602 --> 01:48:00.343
It should be two, then slide.

01:48:00.343 --> 01:48:01.605
That's what I was trying
to tell...

01:48:01.605 --> 01:48:04.434
See? Perky, right?

01:48:05.348 --> 01:48:07.393
Maybe you need
a second opinion.

01:48:07.916 --> 01:48:11.702
Jesus, Bambi! Stop having guys
put their hands on your tits!

01:48:11.702 --> 01:48:13.530
Took that orangutan! Huh!

01:48:19.754 --> 01:48:21.451
You wanna come back
to the party with me?

01:48:21.451 --> 01:48:23.584
Hell, nah. I got plans.

01:48:23.584 --> 01:48:26.935
Huh? They want to do
all that right there? Huh?

01:48:26.935 --> 01:48:28.937
Get the hell up out
of my back door!

01:48:28.937 --> 01:48:30.765
The fuck do you think this is?

01:48:30.765 --> 01:48:32.157
Did we get it right?

01:48:34.333 --> 01:48:35.552
All right, all right,
all right.

01:48:35.552 --> 01:48:36.814
Sit your asses down!

01:48:36.814 --> 01:48:38.424
Say it again.

01:56:07.525 --> 01:56:09.614
difuze
