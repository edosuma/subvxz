WEBVTT

00:01.653 --> 00:02.741
Previously on All Rise...

00:02.785 --> 00:04.874
You were
working for my campaign.

00:04.917 --> 00:06.702
It looked like
you were trying to buy votes.

00:06.745 --> 00:08.399
- Oh.
- "Oh" is right.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.749
Emily Lopez, working
for the biggest pro bono

00:10.793 --> 00:12.403
- law firm in the world?
- No pressure. None.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.231
The Southland
Women's Reentry Center.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.059
Many women live there
with their children.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.800
Louise and Harry Collins?
What's happening?

00:17.843 --> 00:19.758
You must be
Charlotte Collins.

00:19.802 --> 00:21.673
Excuse me,
you can't just take them.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.066
Please, you've got
to help me fix this.

00:23.110 --> 00:25.025
I will, I will,
I will, I will.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.724
Ah, peekaboo.

00:29.768 --> 00:32.162
Peekaboo.
Oh, what you got there?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.468
What you got there?

00:36.384 --> 00:37.472
Yeah.

00:37.907 --> 00:41.693
Oh, what did
your daddy do?

00:43.086 --> 00:44.131
Okay.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.486
Okay.

01:00.495 --> 01:01.757
Yep.

01:03.889 --> 01:07.502
Mm-hmm. Okay.
Okay. It's okay.

01:07.545 --> 01:09.373
You do know
that babies tend

01:09.417 --> 01:12.550
to stop wearing diapers
before the age of four, right?

01:12.594 --> 01:14.030
You've got
enough pampers in there

01:14.074 --> 01:16.206
to last Bailey
until her senior prom.

01:16.250 --> 01:17.381
Very funny.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.122
Robin Taylor,

01:19.166 --> 01:22.256
you have got our home looking
like a wholesale warehouse

01:22.299 --> 01:23.866
with all these coupons.

01:23.909 --> 01:26.303
So, would you prefer
I not pay lower

01:26.347 --> 01:27.522
than low-low prices?

01:27.565 --> 01:28.827
All right.
Start talking.

01:28.871 --> 01:30.177
Who's your supplier.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.962
I get
my coupons from Nancy.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.399
Nancy Adler?

01:35.443 --> 01:37.140
From your
little mommy social club?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.534
Nancy's got you
all hopped up?

01:39.577 --> 01:41.884
On deals
and discounts, yes.

01:42.624 --> 01:43.973
You're welcome.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.411
Wait a minute.

01:47.455 --> 01:50.327
Mmm. I think I know
what's going on here.

01:50.371 --> 01:52.460
You think I'm jealous?

01:52.503 --> 01:55.071
Oh, no, no.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.768
I've got
to get to work.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.944
Anything new
on the Sherri assistant drama?

01:58.988 --> 02:01.904
Oh, Sherri kept her word.

02:01.947 --> 02:04.080
She transferred
to Delgado's courtroom.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.865
But I
have already decided

02:06.909 --> 02:08.867
that she ain't
going out like that.

02:08.911 --> 02:11.131
All right.
Handle your business.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.958
- Good day, sir.
- Okay.

02:13.002 --> 02:14.656
Bye, Bailey.
Oh, wait, wait.

02:14.699 --> 02:16.788
I got you
a value sausage biscuit

02:16.832 --> 02:18.834
for your car ride.

02:18.877 --> 02:20.662
I don't want
your little discount biscuit.

02:20.705 --> 02:23.143
- Thank you.
- Okay, well I'll eat it.

02:27.843 --> 02:28.931
Bye!

02:33.892 --> 02:36.765
<i>â™ª 'Cause it hurts my mind</i>

02:36.808 --> 02:38.810
<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

02:38.854 --> 02:40.943
Damn,
did that just happen?

02:40.986 --> 02:43.206
Did Mark Callan just
outrun Luke Watkins? Dude.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.816
Dude.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.297
Did Mark Callan just
refer to us in third person?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.081
Because Watkins
really hates that.

02:49.125 --> 02:50.648
So, what's your excuse?

02:50.692 --> 02:52.302
What, you got
a pebble in your shoe?

02:52.346 --> 02:54.304
Didn't get enough
sleep last night? What's up?

02:54.348 --> 02:57.046
Well, that and I just
haven't worked out in a while.

02:57.525 --> 02:58.961
- How about you?
- Yeah,

02:59.004 --> 03:01.050
I've had
my share of sleepless nights.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.792
It's not every day
you go up against your buddy

03:03.835 --> 03:05.228
in a murder trial.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.361
Let's make a pact.

03:08.100 --> 03:10.668
We keep up
our weekly jogs as usual.

03:10.712 --> 03:12.409
No matter who wins?

03:12.453 --> 03:13.932
No matter who loses.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.499
Deal.

03:16.370 --> 03:19.764
Like the saying goes,
"Bros before..."

03:20.374 --> 03:21.418
Litigation?

03:21.462 --> 03:23.072
Bros before litigation.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.075
Hey, no fair, man.
You're getting a head start.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.295
I've got a new trick,

03:28.338 --> 03:29.731
guaranteed to knock
your Barbie socks off.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.211
Zachary,
I am not in the mood.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.213
You know,
I'm good with the 101 tricks

03:33.256 --> 03:34.649
you showed me
over the weekend.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.172
Oh, girl, real quick.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
Now,
do you have a quarter?

03:38.957 --> 03:41.917
No? Okay, look,
I have one right here.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.094
Okay,
so what I'm going to do,

03:45.137 --> 03:46.835
I'm going to
take this quarter,

03:46.878 --> 03:48.358
and magically
put it inside of this balloon.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.534
When it happens,
it's going to instantaneously

03:50.578 --> 03:52.710
turn into
a bunch of dollars, yeah?

03:52.754 --> 03:54.843
So, you're
going to be my assistant.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.237
You hold this.
There you go.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.416
Woah! Oh, my God.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.722
Zachary, what the hell?

04:04.766 --> 04:06.115
I'm so sorry.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.682
You know,
it appears that I purchased

04:07.725 --> 04:09.597
the confetti bomb
version by mistake.

04:09.640 --> 04:10.859
Okay,
do you have one of those

04:10.902 --> 04:12.382
cute
little vacuum things

04:12.426 --> 04:14.341
- that we can just clean up--
- You get away.

04:14.384 --> 04:15.864
Oh, fine, fine.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.169
Oh, my God. What?

04:21.130 --> 04:22.914
Where'd the quarter go?

04:25.787 --> 04:26.918
Hey, Wilson.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.803
All right, Kansky.
This is how it's going down.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.021
You're
coming back to my court

04:43.065 --> 04:44.588
at least for the week

04:44.632 --> 04:46.677
and if you want
to leave after that, then fine,

04:46.721 --> 04:48.070
but for right now
it's you and me,

04:48.113 --> 04:49.463
so snatch up
your hot tea,

04:49.506 --> 04:50.855
gather your little
meditation crystals,

04:50.899 --> 04:52.379
and be at my courtroom

04:52.422 --> 04:54.294
before they start calling
morning calendar. Got it?

04:54.903 --> 04:56.383
Good.

04:57.993 --> 05:00.300
Fine.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.390
But I'm bringing
this chair with me.

05:07.045 --> 05:09.439
What's happening today
is evidentiary hearing.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.180
The judge is going to
rule on the motion

05:11.223 --> 05:12.834
that I filed
to throw out the statements

05:12.877 --> 05:14.139
- you gave to police.
- Look,

05:14.183 --> 05:16.141
I know
the strongest evidence

05:16.185 --> 05:18.361
the DA got against me
is about DNA

05:18.405 --> 05:19.623
so I've been reading up.

05:19.667 --> 05:21.582
They say
one to four percent

05:21.625 --> 05:23.497
all DNA matches are false.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.629
- Carl, listen to me--
- You need to tell the jury

05:25.673 --> 05:26.717
about all of that.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.153
There is this legal thing

05:28.197 --> 05:29.677
called
the presumption of innocence.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.418
Yeah, I know,
innocent until proven guilty.

05:31.461 --> 05:34.072
Right, it exists
in theory, but I promise you,

05:34.116 --> 05:36.336
from the moment that you step
in front of those jurors,

05:36.379 --> 05:39.643
they're already pegging you
as a cold-blooded murderer

05:39.687 --> 05:41.079
who shot
a woman in the head

05:41.123 --> 05:43.038
and dumped
her body in the trash bin.

05:44.039 --> 05:45.649
But I can persuade them

05:45.693 --> 05:47.477
that their
preconceived notions are wrong,

05:47.521 --> 05:49.349
but I need you
to stop fighting me.

05:51.525 --> 05:54.963
Do you believe
I'm innocent Mr. Watkins?

05:55.485 --> 05:56.747
It doesn't matter
what I think.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.314
Nah, nah, nah.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.142
I need you
to answer my question.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.147
My job
is to show how weak

06:05.190 --> 06:07.018
the prosecution's case
is against you.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.498
That's
the only thing that matters.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.068
Yeah, I was
going to represent myself.

06:13.111 --> 06:14.983
My sister said no.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.376
She told me
it'd be stupid

06:16.419 --> 06:19.814
not to ask for a--
a public defender.

06:28.910 --> 06:30.302
Please.

06:31.303 --> 06:32.957
I don't want to be
one of those guys

06:33.001 --> 06:34.437
that gets old in prison

06:34.481 --> 06:36.570
before someone finally
proves they're innocent.

06:38.093 --> 06:41.966
Please. Please, Mr. Watkins.

06:42.576 --> 06:44.882
I'm putting
my life in your hands.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.981
Today's
calendar, Your Honor.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.070
Thank you, Sherri.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.899
This case is already
working my last nerve.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.466
It feels
like it's been 100 years

07:03.510 --> 07:05.294
and we haven't even
started the trial yet.

07:05.337 --> 07:08.297
I just hate the thought
of seeing Mark and Luke

07:08.340 --> 07:09.951
go at each other's
throats in court.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.474
I would posit
that if the trial had gone

07:11.518 --> 07:13.302
to someone like Lasky,
the punisher would be

07:13.345 --> 07:14.956
eating Luke Watkins
alive right about now.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.871
Lasky
does have an appetite

07:16.914 --> 07:19.569
for new public defenders,
that's for sure.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.744
But I see your point.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.878
See, that's why
we work well together.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.401
You're the Yin
to my Yang.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.143
- Ping to my pong.
- If you say so, Your Honor.

07:31.102 --> 07:34.584
Aw, that sneaky
husband of mine.

07:34.628 --> 07:38.066
He snuck my favorite
shea butter into my briefcase.

07:38.109 --> 07:40.198
It's the little things.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.245
Wait a minute.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.162
Looks like
the only reason he got me

07:47.205 --> 07:50.513
this hand cream
is 'cause he had a coupon.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.776
Does this man not think
I'm worth full price?

07:57.738 --> 07:59.174
Emily?

07:59.827 --> 08:00.958
Amy, hey.

08:01.002 --> 08:02.525
Hi...

08:02.569 --> 08:04.440
- what are you doing here?
- What?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.616
I mean, not that I mind
the surprise visit.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.226
Oh, well, that's-- Okay.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.100
Okay, so I ran
into Ness in court

08:12.143 --> 08:13.710
and I mentioned
that there's still

08:13.754 --> 08:15.973
no desk available for me
at Free Council Initiative.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.714
And Ness
offered you Rachel's office

08:17.758 --> 08:19.150
until she gets back.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.543
Obviously
without your knowledge.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.849
I am so sorry.

08:21.892 --> 08:23.633
I can-- I can find
someplace else, honestly--

08:23.677 --> 08:25.983
No, absolutely not.
Her instincts are spot on.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.681
I would've
invited you myself.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.511
I really,
really appreciate it.

08:31.554 --> 08:33.948
So, what case
are you working on?

08:33.991 --> 08:35.471
Charlotte Collins.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.604
Single mom
in the country on a green card.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.997
She caught a mayhem case
and I got it reduced

08:40.041 --> 08:41.738
to felony,
false imprisonment,

08:41.782 --> 08:43.131
so she is set up

08:43.174 --> 08:44.524
at the reentry
center on probation,

08:44.567 --> 08:47.178
but DCFS
still took her two kids.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.832
When's the hearing?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.007
In a couple days.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.705
I dropped the ball.

08:51.748 --> 08:53.663
Like, I should have
been in front of this.

08:53.707 --> 08:56.492
You were focused on keeping
Charlotte out of custody

08:56.536 --> 08:59.626
and in the country,
and you did exactly that.

09:00.322 --> 09:03.064
And you will
get her kids back, too.

09:03.717 --> 09:07.068
In the meantime,
make yourself at home.

09:09.070 --> 09:10.375
Thank you so much.

09:10.419 --> 09:11.681
You're welcome.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.642
All right.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.687
Olani Broadnax,
am I pronouncing that

09:17.731 --> 09:19.384
- correctly?
- Yes.

09:19.428 --> 09:21.125
You are a stenographer
at Elite Deposition Solutions,

09:21.169 --> 09:22.953
Riverside County
Superior Court.

09:22.997 --> 09:24.389
Oh, goodness.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.261
- Excuse me?
- It's strong.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.958
Very, very strong.

09:28.002 --> 09:29.438
My boss gave--

09:29.481 --> 09:31.222
It is
a little strong, isn't it?

09:31.266 --> 09:33.660
No, dear.
Your energy is strong.

09:33.703 --> 09:36.271
I feel it
emanating from your aura.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.620
You see, I'm a psychic.

09:37.664 --> 09:39.143
I'm looking for this job

09:39.187 --> 09:40.623
as a court reporter
to supplement my income.

09:40.667 --> 09:44.409
Oh. I sense someone
well above your pay grade

09:44.453 --> 09:45.759
seeking your forgiveness.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.067
- Oh.
- Someone very close to you.

09:50.546 --> 09:52.766
Well, you are not going to
win me over that easily.

09:52.809 --> 09:54.419
What's that, dear?

09:54.855 --> 09:56.421
Miss Olani Broadnax.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.598
Welcome to courtroom 802.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.512
Of course.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.123
Did you know
that was coming?

10:02.166 --> 10:03.690
I saw that, too.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.824
Hi, Darius?

10:07.868 --> 10:09.565
Hi, I-- I'm Sara Castillo,

10:09.609 --> 10:11.523
I'm the victim's advocate
assigned to this case.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.047
Uh, right. Right.
Hi-- hi, Miss Castillo.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.614
Oh, no, please.
Call me Sara.

10:17.747 --> 10:19.749
I'll-- Sorry,
you'll have to

10:19.793 --> 10:21.359
excuse me appearance.

10:22.578 --> 10:25.450
Anyway I'm here
to offer any support I can.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.365
I-- I also want
to offer my condolences.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.715
You know,
I know it must be tough

10:28.758 --> 10:30.151
just sitting
through this trial

10:30.194 --> 10:31.456
and hearing
all the details--

10:31.500 --> 10:33.720
All due respect,
Miss Castillo,

10:33.763 --> 10:35.330
my mom was the victim.

10:35.722 --> 10:36.810
Not me.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.987
So, I'm going to
head in there now.

10:40.030 --> 10:42.250
Oh, yeah.
Yes. Please.

10:49.561 --> 10:51.302
<i>Did you pick up</i> <i>
Brenda Fletcher</i>

10:51.346 --> 10:52.826
<i>from the bar</i> <i>
she worked at?</i>

10:56.003 --> 10:57.439
<i>You know, maybe I--</i>

10:57.482 --> 10:58.527
<i>maybe</i> <i>
I should get a lawyer.</i>

11:00.007 --> 11:02.531
<i>I keep telling you</i> <i>
I didn't kill nobody.</i>

11:02.574 --> 11:04.315
<i>We found your DNA</i>

11:04.359 --> 11:05.969
<i>on her dead body, Carl.</i>

11:06.013 --> 11:09.669
<i>It's like your signature</i> <i>
is all over her corpse.</i>

11:12.367 --> 11:13.847
Thank you, Judge.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.675
Very well, Mr. Watkins.

11:15.718 --> 11:18.503
I will hear you one last time
before I rule in the evidence.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.331
Your Honor,
detectives relentlessly

11:20.375 --> 11:24.292
interrogated Carl Brewer
for 21 continuous hours.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.163
He was not
in his right state of mind.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.122
Even more outrageous,

11:28.165 --> 11:29.819
his statements
were made involuntarily.

11:29.863 --> 11:33.475
He continuously asked
the detectives for an attorney

11:33.518 --> 11:34.737
and they denied him.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.434
Your Honor,
the techniques

11:36.478 --> 11:37.827
used by the detectives
during the interrogation

11:37.871 --> 11:40.047
were not coercive,
and for Mr. Watkins

11:40.090 --> 11:41.744
to suggest otherwise is--

11:41.788 --> 11:43.398
Look, I'll borrow

11:43.441 --> 11:45.530
one of his own dramatic terms,
here, "outrageous."

11:45.574 --> 11:47.968
Mr. Brewer clearly
stated that he understood

11:48.011 --> 11:50.013
he had a right
to retain appointed council,

11:50.057 --> 11:53.016
and yet he never definitely
asked for an attorney.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.671
- He waived his Miranda rights.
- He absolutely did not.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.759
Stop.

11:56.803 --> 11:58.021
I'm ready to rule.

11:58.065 --> 11:59.370
Mr. Watkins,
as to your motion

11:59.414 --> 12:01.677
to suppress
Mr. Brewer's statements,

12:01.721 --> 12:03.723
I believe detectives
had an affirmative duty

12:03.766 --> 12:07.248
to confirm whether Mr. Brewer
was exercising his right

12:07.291 --> 12:08.640
against self-incrimination.

12:08.684 --> 12:10.381
With all
due respect, Your Honor,

12:10.425 --> 12:12.253
the law says the officers
do not have to clarify--

12:12.296 --> 12:13.863
It is good
police practice to do so.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.778
I believe the detectives
should have asked

12:15.822 --> 12:17.780
further questions
to clarify.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.827
I'm granting the defense's
motion to suppress.

12:20.870 --> 12:24.047
Now, as for
the people's 402 motion,

12:24.091 --> 12:25.440
relevance regarding

12:25.483 --> 12:26.833
the defendant's
medical condition.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.791
Mr. Callan,
it is your position

12:28.835 --> 12:30.924
that the jury
should not hear

12:30.967 --> 12:33.317
Mr. Brewer's suffers
from acute myeloid leukemia,

12:33.361 --> 12:34.928
correct?
Yes, Your Honor.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.756
It's clear
that the defense is only trying

12:36.799 --> 12:38.758
to gain the jury's sympathy
by mentioning that--

12:38.801 --> 12:40.760
Mr. Brewer has suffered from
leukemia his entire adult life,

12:40.803 --> 12:42.370
he would not have
the physical ability,

12:42.413 --> 12:44.459
nor the energy,
to commit such a murder.

12:44.502 --> 12:46.330
Well, it doesn't take
much vim and vigor

12:46.374 --> 12:48.811
- to pull a trigger, Your Honor.
- The victim wasn't just shot.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.682
Her hair was ripped out,
her wrists bound,

12:50.726 --> 12:52.510
he body dumped like trash.
That takes energy.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.077
Energy
that Mr. Brewer does not have.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.079
Mr. Watkins.
Take a breath.

12:59.343 --> 13:03.086
I find that the defense
as a proponent of the evidence

13:03.130 --> 13:05.697
regarding your client's
current medical condition

13:05.741 --> 13:07.787
has not met its burden.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.571
Your Honor,
you cannot be serious,

13:09.614 --> 13:11.094
the jury needs to hear--
The probative value

13:11.138 --> 13:12.922
of your client's
medical condition is outweighed

13:12.966 --> 13:14.837
by the risk
of undue prejudice.

13:14.881 --> 13:17.448
I agree with the people
that this evidence would elicit

13:17.492 --> 13:19.102
more sympathy
than it would tend

13:19.146 --> 13:20.625
to disprove identity.

13:20.669 --> 13:22.279
My client has an absolute
constitutional right

13:22.323 --> 13:23.759
to present a--

13:23.803 --> 13:25.456
But not
with inadmissible evidence.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.503
I have excluded
the evidence on 352 grounds,

13:28.546 --> 13:31.158
and do not
interrupt me again.

13:31.201 --> 13:32.724
I apologize, Your Honor.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.989
The trial
will begin in a couple days.

13:49.176 --> 13:50.351
Good morning, Your Honor.

13:50.394 --> 13:51.831
I'm hoping it will be.

13:52.396 --> 13:54.050
Tea for you,
two for me.

13:54.094 --> 13:56.966
I might need
to triple up on the caffeine.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.838
I did so much tossing
and turning last night.

13:58.881 --> 14:01.449
- Is it the trial?
- If the evidentiary hearing

14:01.492 --> 14:03.538
is any indication,
it's about to get

14:03.581 --> 14:05.148
- brutal out there.
- This must be an immense amount

14:05.192 --> 14:07.672
of pressure for Luke,
I can't think of any new PD

14:07.716 --> 14:09.979
who got
a murder case so soon.

14:10.023 --> 14:11.459
He has come a long way

14:11.502 --> 14:13.026
in a short amount
of time, Your Honor.

14:13.896 --> 14:14.941
Sherri.

14:16.246 --> 14:18.509
How are you and I doing?

14:18.553 --> 14:21.208
Are we making
any bit of progress here?

14:21.773 --> 14:24.776
Your Honor,
I will be returning

14:24.820 --> 14:26.866
to Judge Delgado's
court on Monday.

14:31.566 --> 14:32.741
I want to see my kids.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.786
- Now!
- Ma'am, calm down.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.353
- Don't tell me to calm down!
- Ma'am--

14:36.397 --> 14:37.920
Charlotte, hey,
I have been looking

14:37.964 --> 14:40.314
- all over the town for you.
- Louise is sick.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.794
They say she's in the hospital
but they won't tell me where!

14:42.838 --> 14:44.579
- Charlotte--
- Where is my daughter?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.233
You need
to get her out of here.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.061
I got it. Thank you.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.976
Charlotte, look at me.
Your daughter is fine.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.368
No, I spoke to the doctor

14:51.412 --> 14:52.892
after
the reentry center called me.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.632
She is fine,
she had an ear infection.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.330
She's okay.
She's okay.

14:58.723 --> 15:00.421
I need
to see my children.

15:00.464 --> 15:01.901
I understand,
but right now

15:01.944 --> 15:03.685
we need
to get you back to the center

15:03.728 --> 15:05.774
- because you cannot afford to--
- Oh, God.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.560
Officers, hi,
we had a young lady

15:09.604 --> 15:11.736
who was distraught,
but it's fine.

15:11.780 --> 15:13.913
- I'm her attorney.
- We need to talk to her.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.566
Okay, look,
she found out her kid was sick

15:15.610 --> 15:17.133
and she panicked,
all right?

15:17.177 --> 15:19.396
We are on our way out
right now, I promise.

15:21.964 --> 15:25.141
The murder trial
of 56-year-old Carl Brewer

15:25.185 --> 15:26.708
begins in about an hour.

15:26.751 --> 15:28.666
The forklift operator
is accused

15:28.710 --> 15:30.581
of shooting
a woman to death.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.888
This morning,
the victim's 20-year-old son,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.411
Darius Fletcher...
I join you

15:34.455 --> 15:35.760
with someone today
who is concerned

15:35.804 --> 15:37.066
about
the dangerous effects

15:37.110 --> 15:39.068
of under-policing
in our communities.

15:40.461 --> 15:42.854
So many women
in the past three decades

15:42.898 --> 15:45.248
have gone missing
or been murdered,

15:45.292 --> 15:46.771
the cases unsolved.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.556
So, in the spirit
of calling for justice

15:48.599 --> 15:51.689
for my mom,
and other women,

15:51.733 --> 15:54.910
I ask that you join me
in saying their names.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.914
Sheila James.
Sheila James!

15:58.958 --> 16:01.569
Harriet Boyd.
Harriet Boyd!

16:01.612 --> 16:04.267
Martina Sanchez.
Martina Sanchez!

16:04.311 --> 16:07.444
I'm not saying I disagree,
I just wonder if the push

16:07.488 --> 16:08.968
for more policing
doesn't get lost

16:09.011 --> 16:11.927
behind the argument
for defunding the police.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.408
Police reform
can walk the fine line

16:14.451 --> 16:16.453
between maintaining
public safety

16:16.497 --> 16:17.889
and decreasing
police brutality.

16:17.933 --> 16:19.804
This murder trial
I'm handling right now

16:19.848 --> 16:21.371
has me thinking
about all of it.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.286
Clearly,
black and brown communities

16:23.330 --> 16:24.809
are suffering
the worst of it.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.420
The problem
is either aggressive policing

16:26.463 --> 16:27.899
or not enough policing.

16:27.943 --> 16:29.945
Or both, you know,
it's a complex issue,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.165
and one which probably
isn't going to be solved

16:32.208 --> 16:34.297
over coffee and fruit
in the judge's lounge.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.952
Oh, here we go.
I'll say this.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.085
Most police officers
in this country...

16:39.868 --> 16:41.826
are selfless,
patriotic citizens.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.524
No one is disputing that.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.656
Yes, we must curtail

16:45.700 --> 16:47.310
the authority
for police officers

16:47.354 --> 16:49.921
to use deadly force,
but not to the extent

16:49.965 --> 16:51.662
that their
actions are frozen

16:51.706 --> 16:53.273
when confronting
violent crime.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.840
Since you chimed in
with the pitch of the problem,

16:55.884 --> 16:57.581
why don't you hit us
with a solution?

16:57.625 --> 16:58.843
I'll
hit you with several.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.715
De-escalation training.

17:00.758 --> 17:02.586
The tearing down
of the blue wall of silence

17:02.630 --> 17:04.153
which protects
abusive policing,

17:04.197 --> 17:06.503
more effective training
for police officers

17:06.547 --> 17:08.418
dealing
with crisis intervention.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.594
I want to bring this
back around to the dangers

17:10.638 --> 17:12.248
of under-policing.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.903
Grassroots organizations
have long offered up

17:14.946 --> 17:16.948
solutions to these issues.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.951
Real progress would be
city and police leaders

17:19.995 --> 17:22.650
- sitting down with them.
- Not just every other quarter.

17:22.693 --> 17:25.044
And that's something
on which we all agree.

17:26.132 --> 17:27.307
I'm not bad.

17:28.090 --> 17:30.527
We should
have this chat every week.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.268
We'll be here.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.016
Mr. Slimms.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.192
- Jimmy Slimms.
- That's me.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.064
Luke Watkins,
we consulted on the Brewer case

17:45.107 --> 17:46.717
over the phone,
I was supposed

17:46.761 --> 17:48.763
- to meet you here.
- Oh, yes. Forgive me.

17:48.806 --> 17:50.634
Most days, I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.506
But right now
I am going.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.898
I'm sorry.
I've got to get to trial.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.552
I-- I just
need two seconds.

17:55.596 --> 17:56.945
Have you found

17:56.988 --> 17:58.555
any discrepancies
on how the police

17:58.599 --> 18:00.079
collected the evidence?

18:00.122 --> 18:02.907
Compromised DNA?
Contamination testing issues?

18:02.951 --> 18:05.171
I haven't spotted
any inconsistencies,

18:05.214 --> 18:06.868
and we may not
find any, Mr. Watkins.

18:06.911 --> 18:08.130
That's just the reality.

18:08.826 --> 18:11.177
Trust me, I've seen
DNA specimen techniques

18:11.220 --> 18:13.353
as messed up
as a Hogan's goat.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.964
But not here.

18:16.791 --> 18:18.009
If you could just
take another look

18:18.053 --> 18:19.446
at the case file
I sent you.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.925
I'll try
and grab some time

18:20.969 --> 18:22.536
- over the next couple days.
- Great.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.669
- I will call you.
- I will call you.

18:26.148 --> 18:27.584
There were
rope burns

18:27.628 --> 18:29.064
on the victim's wrists.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.935
And we could see
that a lock of her hair

18:30.979 --> 18:32.459
had been ripped
from the scalp.

18:32.502 --> 18:34.374
And where did you
apprehend the suspect?

18:34.417 --> 18:36.245
In
the backyard of his home.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.160
He never asked
why he was being arrested,

18:38.204 --> 18:39.466
which I found odd.

18:39.509 --> 18:41.381
Yo, can he even say that?

18:41.424 --> 18:42.817
You should object.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.079
...you
found in the alley,

18:44.123 --> 18:46.429
what kind of
bullet was it?

18:46.473 --> 18:48.431
The casing we found
was from a silver colored

18:48.475 --> 18:49.824
nine-millimeter bullet,

18:49.867 --> 18:51.173
it's a very
particular piece of ammo.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.088
And what
more did you find?

18:53.132 --> 18:55.003
Using
the automated firearm system

18:55.046 --> 18:56.744
we were able
to find out that Mr. Brewer

18:56.787 --> 18:58.789
- owns a nine-millimeter.
- He's lying.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.661
I'm telling you to object.

19:00.704 --> 19:02.663
And I'm
telling you to be cool.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.404
...from
the shell casing

19:04.447 --> 19:06.232
found at the scene,
we determine that Mr. Brewer

19:06.275 --> 19:09.017
owns the same type of gun
used to murder the victim.

19:09.496 --> 19:11.454
Thank you, detective Blair.

19:11.498 --> 19:12.847
Mr. Watkins.

19:16.155 --> 19:18.679
You led a search
of Mr. Brewer's home,

19:18.722 --> 19:20.071
correct?
Correct.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.812
But you
didn't find any firearms

19:21.856 --> 19:23.292
in the house, correct?

19:23.336 --> 19:25.381
As I already stated,
we knew Mr. Brewer had

19:25.425 --> 19:26.991
the same type of gun.

19:27.035 --> 19:30.169
- Is that a yes, or no?
- No. We didn't find a gun.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.127
In fact,
Mr. Brewer filed a report

19:32.171 --> 19:33.955
years ago
that a nine-millimeter gun

19:33.998 --> 19:35.217
that he owned was stolen,

19:35.261 --> 19:36.827
- isn't that right?
- Correct.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.177
It's funny,
I didn't hear you tell

19:38.220 --> 19:39.787
- the prosecution that.
- Objection.

19:39.830 --> 19:41.223
Withdrawn.

19:41.267 --> 19:44.052
Did you find
any of Mr. Brewer's DNA

19:44.095 --> 19:45.706
in the alley
where you believe

19:45.749 --> 19:47.229
Mrs. Fletcher
was shot to death?

19:47.273 --> 19:49.362
Just
Mr. Brewer's DNA on her body.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.277
And you testified
earlier that you didn't find

19:51.320 --> 19:53.888
any scratches, bruises
or cuts on Mr. Brewer,

19:53.931 --> 19:55.281
correct?
Correct.

19:55.324 --> 19:56.717
Yet, you found,

19:56.760 --> 19:58.197
or you say
you found his DNA

19:58.240 --> 20:00.373
under
the victim's fingernails?

20:00.416 --> 20:02.853
Right, again,
I stated that I personally

20:02.897 --> 20:04.768
didn't observe
any injuries on your client.

20:04.812 --> 20:06.074
That doesn't mean
he didn't have any.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.380
That's all, Your Honor.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.253
Redirect, Mr. Callan?
- No, Your Honor.

20:11.819 --> 20:15.214
Your Honor,
I'd like to address the court.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.390
I'd like
to fire my lawyer.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.913
Carl.
Excuse me?

20:18.956 --> 20:20.654
Bailiff, remove this man
from my courtroom.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.699
Mr. Watkins is not
following any of my directions.

20:22.743 --> 20:24.310
I demand new council.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.703
Members of the jury,
we will take a break.

20:26.747 --> 20:28.357
Disregard
Mr. Brewer's statement.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.054
- I demand new council.
- Mr. Watkins,

20:30.098 --> 20:31.404
you need
to control your client.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.667
- Bailiff.
- Mr. Watkins is not adequate

20:33.710 --> 20:34.798
for my defense.

20:34.842 --> 20:36.496
My sixth amendment right...

20:44.243 --> 20:46.245
You showed a lack
of respect for this court,

20:46.288 --> 20:47.550
for council,
and most significantly,

20:47.594 --> 20:48.812
for the jury.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.423
Any more
outbursts like that

20:50.466 --> 20:53.121
and I will have you removed
for the rest of trial.

20:53.164 --> 20:55.993
- Am I clear?
- Yes, Your Honor.

20:56.037 --> 21:00.041
I will say, I considered
your request for new council,

21:00.084 --> 21:02.086
and since you
did not make this request

21:02.130 --> 21:03.566
before trial began,
and we are already

21:03.610 --> 21:06.874
deep into testimony,
I am denying your request

21:06.917 --> 21:08.049
for a Marsden hearing.

21:08.092 --> 21:11.095
I know
Mr. Watkins well,

21:11.139 --> 21:12.923
and he
is an excellent attorney.

21:12.967 --> 21:14.838
It would
behoove you to trust him

21:14.882 --> 21:16.275
in representing you.

21:17.972 --> 21:20.844
We will pick up again
tomorrow morning. Bailiff?

21:20.888 --> 21:21.976
Thank you, Your Honor.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.295
I miss my kids.

21:36.904 --> 21:37.992
I know you do.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.386
But you get
to see the judge tomorrow.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.126
I'll be
right there with you.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.304
I'm a screwup.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.567
And the judge
is going to know that.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.918
Well, then you
must be screwup number two

21:50.961 --> 21:53.790
because I hold the title.

21:53.834 --> 21:55.357
Oh no.

21:55.401 --> 21:57.185
You should have seen me
when I was a teenager.

21:57.228 --> 22:00.144
You could
not tell me anything.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.973
I had all the answers,
I knew it all.

22:03.017 --> 22:06.150
If there was a rule,
I just broke it, you know?

22:06.194 --> 22:07.978
I spent time in juvey.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.502
You were in juvey?
Mm-hmm.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.808
And then I just--

22:11.852 --> 22:13.941
I turned things
around for myself.

22:14.768 --> 22:17.553
Look at you now. A lawyer.

22:17.597 --> 22:19.294
And look at you.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.515
A fearless mom
who has raised

22:22.558 --> 22:26.257
two beautiful,
amazing kids on her own.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.347
That doesn't look
like a screwup to me.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.265
Can I tell you something?

22:34.309 --> 22:35.789
Yeah.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.747
They tried
to take away my kids

22:37.791 --> 22:39.967
before I came
to the States.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.840
Sherri?

22:45.712 --> 22:47.975
Oh, what
are we smiling at?

22:48.018 --> 22:49.672
It looks like our
new stenographer slash psychic

22:49.716 --> 22:51.021
has earned her keep.

22:51.065 --> 22:52.414
She predicted
that an admirer

22:52.458 --> 22:54.198
would give me
a gift and here it is.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.852
A gift card to Cycle City.

22:55.896 --> 22:57.114
Someone just
left it on my desk.

22:57.158 --> 22:58.942
Sherri,

22:58.986 --> 23:01.205
Robin actually
got me that gift card.

23:01.249 --> 23:02.685
It must have
fallen out of my bag

23:02.729 --> 23:04.557
and someone accidentally
placed it on your desk,

23:04.600 --> 23:08.212
but, no, no, no, no, no,
Sherri, you-- you keep it.

23:08.256 --> 23:09.997
No, thank you.
It's yours.

23:10.040 --> 23:11.390
Come on, Sherri.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.435
When would I
even have the time?

23:13.479 --> 23:16.482
I suggest
you make the time, Your Honor.

23:20.964 --> 23:24.620
Mr. Watkins.
I'm sorry to disturb you.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.274
I'm Carl's sister, Mildred.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.711
I met you when you
first took on his case.

23:28.755 --> 23:31.279
Yes. I-- I remember.

23:32.715 --> 23:36.153
I'm so sorry
about my brother's outburst

23:36.197 --> 23:37.503
today in court.

23:37.546 --> 23:39.113
That should
not have happened.

23:39.156 --> 23:40.941
Please,
have a seat.

23:40.984 --> 23:44.684
He has had
challenges his whole life.

23:44.727 --> 23:48.949
When we were kids,
Carl got into a lot of trouble.

23:48.992 --> 23:51.125
I've been trying
my whole life

23:51.168 --> 23:54.041
to restore him to Christ.

23:54.084 --> 23:57.000
It may be true
he's trapped in sin,

23:57.044 --> 24:00.613
but my brother
is not a murderer.

24:04.617 --> 24:07.533
You said that your
grandparents raised you two?

24:07.576 --> 24:10.884
- What happened to your parents?
- Momma, well...

24:11.754 --> 24:13.277
she had a hard time.

24:13.321 --> 24:16.498
- And I didn't mean to--
- No. No, it's fine.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.459
I think about
how sick my brother was

24:20.502 --> 24:22.896
with leukemia
and everything.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.246
I was his only caretaker

24:25.289 --> 24:27.335
after our grandparents passed.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.817
I've seen
that cancer come and go

24:30.860 --> 24:34.168
and come back again,

24:34.211 --> 24:38.564
but because
of God's grace and mercy,

24:38.607 --> 24:40.479
my brother is still here.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.394
I went
to Howard University.

24:43.438 --> 24:46.354
Mom helped me enroll
using some outrageous money.

24:47.094 --> 24:49.270
She sounds
like a wonderful lady.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.490
When I was a kid...

24:53.187 --> 24:55.102
my mom,
she got this tattoo

24:55.145 --> 24:57.321
on her arm
of her favorite bible verse,

24:57.365 --> 25:00.020
and I'm not
such a religious guy myself,

25:00.063 --> 25:02.152
but I want
to do something special

25:02.196 --> 25:03.937
to remember her by
so I actually ended up

25:03.980 --> 25:07.027
getting the same tattoo.

25:08.594 --> 25:13.033
"Love does not delight in evil,
but rejoices with the truth."

25:14.208 --> 25:15.949
That's a beautiful verse

25:15.992 --> 25:18.429
and a great tribute
to your mom.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.608
Thank you.

25:25.567 --> 25:28.701
<i>â™ª We just got</i> <i>
To rise up, hoo â™ª</i>

25:28.744 --> 25:30.659
<i>â™ª Rise up, hoo</i>

25:30.703 --> 25:33.053
<i>â™ª Rise up</i>

25:34.010 --> 25:35.534
Come on,
believe in yourself!

25:35.577 --> 25:37.448
You can do anything
you put your mind to!

25:38.188 --> 25:39.842
If you see it,
you can achieve it.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.235
- Let's go!
- Excuse me.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.846
- Lola Carmichael?
- Yeah.

25:43.890 --> 25:47.023
I'm officer Bernard.
My partner, officer Cohen.

25:47.067 --> 25:48.634
We'd like to talk
about the gift card

25:48.677 --> 25:49.852
you used for this class.

25:49.896 --> 25:51.419
Would you come
with us, please?

25:51.941 --> 25:53.116
Yeah.

26:02.343 --> 26:05.607
Tomorrow the prosecution
will call more witnesses,

26:05.651 --> 26:08.088
including the criminalists
that worked with investigators

26:08.131 --> 26:09.698
on your case--
Let me guess,

26:09.742 --> 26:12.092
you grew up
in an upper-middle class home,

26:12.135 --> 26:13.528
went to one of them

26:13.572 --> 26:16.487
highfalutin
private schools, hmm?

26:16.531 --> 26:20.274
Probably only dated
rich white women, huh?

26:20.317 --> 26:23.669
Your mommy and daddy
spoil you rotten, I can tell.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.106
Look.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.761
Carl, I get it.

26:29.544 --> 26:31.502
I get that
you had it rough growing up.

26:31.546 --> 26:33.287
Your sister,
she told me about your--

26:34.244 --> 26:35.594
the troubles you faced.

26:36.290 --> 26:37.552
It's a lot.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.336
Your father's
untimely death...

26:40.207 --> 26:42.775
your mom leaving you
with your grandparents--

26:44.211 --> 26:47.475
Don't talk about
my mother, you understand?

26:48.998 --> 26:51.087
Don't ever talk about her.

26:53.046 --> 26:54.525
It's okay, deputy.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.353
Just give us
a minute, please.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.625
I don't know
if my sister told you...

27:07.887 --> 27:10.541
but after our mother left,

27:10.585 --> 27:13.588
she came back,
years later,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
when she
found out about my cancer.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.245
She was a match

27:18.288 --> 27:20.769
and she wanted
to donate her bone marrow.

27:20.813 --> 27:24.643
Yeah,
and I was so happy.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.471
My momma
came back to save me.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.301
Then she took off again.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.522
Right before my surgery.

27:35.349 --> 27:36.785
I never knew why.

27:37.438 --> 27:41.224
All I knew was my momma
had left me a second time.

27:44.358 --> 27:45.751
She left me.

27:48.014 --> 27:51.974
That bitch
left me to die.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.087
Thanks.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.741
And thanks
for showing up.

28:19.785 --> 28:22.657
You think I wouldn't?
I wasn't-- I'm not--

28:26.139 --> 28:27.575
Can I
ask you a question?

28:28.228 --> 28:29.359
You ever worry
about charging

28:29.403 --> 28:30.839
the wrong guy with murder?

28:30.883 --> 28:32.275
Just curious.

28:32.319 --> 28:34.016
I tend to worry
about the guilty guy

28:34.060 --> 28:35.322
getting away with it.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.499
Look, I've been doing this
long enough to know

28:38.542 --> 28:41.894
that restorative justice
doesn't work for everybody.

28:41.937 --> 28:43.722
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

28:44.287 --> 28:45.724
I can't
tell you everything,

28:45.767 --> 28:47.856
but we are learning
new information--

28:47.900 --> 28:49.728
New information like...
I can't tell you.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.555
Are you planning
to drop a bombshell in trial?

28:51.599 --> 28:53.732
This has nothing
to do with trial, Luke.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.517
And maybe
I shouldn't have said anything,

28:56.560 --> 28:58.432
- but I am your--
- But you sure as hell did.

28:58.475 --> 29:01.565
I'm giving you a heads up
that there is something

29:01.609 --> 29:03.785
coming down the pike, okay?

29:03.829 --> 29:06.092
And there might be
more to Carl Brewer

29:06.135 --> 29:07.397
than you think.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.095
You know
what I think, Callan?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.837
I think this is you
trying to get into my head

29:11.880 --> 29:13.099
and knock me off my game

29:13.142 --> 29:14.796
because your case
is getting weaker

29:14.840 --> 29:16.929
by the minute
and you cannot handle

29:16.972 --> 29:19.453
the thought of losing
to a public defender

29:19.496 --> 29:20.802
in his first murder trial.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.238
Are you
serious right now?

29:22.282 --> 29:23.457
Your ass
can't handle it, Callan.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.632
Wow, man. Okay.

29:24.675 --> 29:26.068
I'll see you in court.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.784
- Bailey's down.
- Mhm.

29:48.351 --> 29:49.613
Thank you, husband.

29:49.657 --> 29:50.963
You're welcome, wife.

29:52.616 --> 29:53.966
Rough day, huh babe?

29:55.924 --> 29:57.926
Well, at least they
didn't throw you in the clink.

29:57.970 --> 29:59.841
You should've let me
come down to help you.

29:59.885 --> 30:01.321
No, it was fine

30:01.364 --> 30:03.453
once I explained
everything to the officers.

30:03.497 --> 30:05.629
The point is
I got embarrassed

30:05.673 --> 30:07.414
in front of my
entire spin class

30:07.457 --> 30:09.546
because of your
little girlfriend, Nancy.

30:10.156 --> 30:13.028
I can't believe that gift card
she gave you was counterfeit.

30:13.072 --> 30:14.769
Nancy.

30:15.248 --> 30:16.727
A wanted scammer.

30:16.771 --> 30:18.947
I didn't see that one coming. Yeah.

30:18.991 --> 30:22.733
I'm as surprised
as you are, Mr. F.B.I. agent.

30:23.734 --> 30:26.912
Guess this puts a huge dent
in me and Nancy's relationship.

30:28.000 --> 30:30.350
It's too soon, Robin.

30:30.393 --> 30:32.874
Too soon.

30:34.876 --> 30:36.138
I'm sorry, baby.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.619
I guess I've got
some making up to do.

30:38.662 --> 30:43.102
Mhm,
but this prime rib feast

30:43.145 --> 30:44.973
is a good start.

30:45.017 --> 30:46.322
It looks delicious.

30:46.366 --> 30:47.671
Mm.

30:52.894 --> 30:53.895
Wait.

30:56.376 --> 30:59.422
Did you buy this dinner
with one of Nancy's coupons?

30:59.901 --> 31:01.424
I plead the fifth,
Your Honor.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.662
- Appreciate you coming.
- Are you kidding?

31:21.705 --> 31:23.490
I live with my brother
in his very crowded home.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.795
Of course I was coming.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.624
Congrats
on the new place, Em,

31:27.668 --> 31:29.278
- I'm happy for you.
- Oh, thank you.

31:31.585 --> 31:33.543
I mean...

31:33.587 --> 31:34.893
...I move in a week or so,

31:34.936 --> 31:37.199
and I-- I just,
I cannot wait.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.506
I look forward to my
invitation to the housewarming.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.116
Well, I look
forward to having you.

31:42.291 --> 31:45.381
So, what's up with this
new adventure of yours

31:45.425 --> 31:47.514
- they call Holistic Law?
- Yeah.

31:48.036 --> 31:50.778
I-- I told you
about the case I'm working.

31:50.821 --> 31:53.128
Single mom trying
to get her kids back.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.738
She's young, you know?

31:54.782 --> 31:57.393
And she's had
a really tough life.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.701
She-- she shared
some stuff with me...

32:01.310 --> 32:04.792
about something she experienced
that was extremely difficult.

32:05.793 --> 32:07.186
Then you share
that with the judge,

32:07.229 --> 32:08.796
and if the judge
is empathetic...

32:08.839 --> 32:11.059
It's Judge Taylor.
Judge Needum Taylor?

32:11.103 --> 32:13.061
I appeared before him
before he was transferred

32:13.105 --> 32:14.497
over to juvenile court.

32:14.541 --> 32:15.890
I'm not going to lie,
he was tough.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.457
Great.
Maybe think about

32:17.500 --> 32:18.937
holding your
most compelling argument

32:18.980 --> 32:21.069
to the very end
right before he rules.

32:21.113 --> 32:23.376
- That worked for me.
- Duly noted.

32:24.986 --> 32:27.989
- So, Luke Watkins...
- Mm.

32:28.033 --> 32:29.904
What's up with this
new adventure of yours

32:29.948 --> 32:31.775
they call public defense?

32:31.819 --> 32:33.473
I'm not going to lie.

32:34.953 --> 32:36.432
It's been tough.

32:36.476 --> 32:39.131
The trial... Callan.

32:40.654 --> 32:42.786
My client,
he shared something

32:42.830 --> 32:45.137
very painful with me
today about his mother.

32:50.055 --> 32:52.274
I could feel...

32:52.318 --> 32:54.233
the misery...

32:54.276 --> 32:55.799
that he was living with.

32:57.105 --> 32:59.629
How haunted he was,
it was--

33:07.811 --> 33:11.293
It was almost like
I could feel that misery, too.

33:15.036 --> 33:16.995
<i>Mr. Slimms,</i> <i>
thanks for getting back.</i>

33:17.038 --> 33:19.171
<i>Did you have a chance to look</i> <i>
at the case file again?</i>

33:19.214 --> 33:22.609
Bottom line, the prosecution
is saying Carl Brewer's DNA,

33:22.652 --> 33:24.045
and only his DNA,

33:24.089 --> 33:25.829
was found
on this woman's body.

33:25.873 --> 33:28.571
A lot of it. <i>
Like, too much to ignore.</i>

33:28.963 --> 33:30.660
You're going
to argue something else.

33:30.704 --> 33:32.271
The DNA is solid.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.447
Hey, listen,
I wanted to ask you again

33:34.490 --> 33:37.885
about my client's, uh,
transplant from 35 years ago.

33:37.928 --> 33:39.626
I thought you weren't allowed
to mention that in trial.

33:39.669 --> 33:41.019
<i>I'm not allowed to talk about</i>

33:41.062 --> 33:42.846
my client's current
medical condition,

33:42.890 --> 33:44.674
but no one said I can't refer
to his medical history.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.024
<i>Well,</i> <i>
you're the lawyer.</i>

33:46.807 --> 33:47.851
Wait a minute.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.593
What kind of transplant
did you say your client had?

33:54.554 --> 33:56.947
I've heard all that
I'm going to hear, Miss Lopez.

33:56.991 --> 33:58.688
I would just like
to say one more thing

33:58.732 --> 34:00.125
on behalf of Miss Collins.

34:00.168 --> 34:02.127
She recently
shared with me something

34:02.170 --> 34:04.346
that she experienced that was
very tough for her to handle

34:04.390 --> 34:06.870
back in British Columbia,
Canada, where she's from.

34:09.134 --> 34:12.224
There was a certain
practice called a birth alert.

34:12.267 --> 34:15.401
It allowed social workers
to flag an expecting parent,

34:15.444 --> 34:17.011
without their consent,

34:17.055 --> 34:19.666
as being unfit
to care for their child.

34:19.709 --> 34:21.407
Tell me how this
relates to the case

34:21.450 --> 34:22.756
- before me?
- Yes, Your Honor.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.888
These birth alerts
were often issued

34:24.932 --> 34:26.629
without regulation,

34:26.673 --> 34:29.067
disproportionately against
indigenous women,

34:29.110 --> 34:31.939
but also low-income
women like Charlotte.

34:32.461 --> 34:35.247
In fact, she received them
during both of her pregnancies.

34:35.290 --> 34:38.206
She spent years
on the run for fear

34:38.250 --> 34:40.904
that her children were
going to be taken from her.

34:41.383 --> 34:44.734
Judge Taylor,
please do not add to the trauma

34:44.778 --> 34:46.649
that Charlotte
has had to endure.

34:46.693 --> 34:49.174
She is a loving...
a loving mother.

34:49.957 --> 34:51.915
And she deserves
to have her children back.

35:18.812 --> 35:21.945
Sherri,
you are a lifesaver.

35:21.989 --> 35:23.643
Very welcome, Your Honor.

35:28.517 --> 35:29.823
It was a look.

35:30.345 --> 35:31.912
This incredulous look

35:31.955 --> 35:33.783
you gave me at
the Public Integrity hearing.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.959
The same look
you give to guilty defendants

35:36.003 --> 35:37.483
before you sentence them.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.834
And in that moment,
it hit me.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.707
The woman
that I have come to respect.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.448
Idolize, even.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.797
And care for.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.843
Would think
that I would steal

35:49.886 --> 35:52.585
half a million dollars
from her campaign.

35:52.628 --> 35:56.284
And though I did nothing
wrong I carry tremendous guilt,

35:56.328 --> 35:58.330
as though I had
somehow betrayed you.

35:58.765 --> 36:01.463
And for that I am angry.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.030
It really hurt.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.207
Sherri.

36:07.513 --> 36:10.733
The look I gave you
wasn't a look of scorn;

36:10.777 --> 36:13.171
it was one of concern.

36:13.214 --> 36:14.737
For the first time,
something nefarious

36:14.781 --> 36:16.478
had happened
in my backyard,

36:16.522 --> 36:19.916
and while
I never for one second

36:19.960 --> 36:22.049
believed that
you had stolen that money,

36:22.092 --> 36:23.659
someone in my camp did,

36:23.703 --> 36:26.401
and I was
worried sick about it.

36:26.445 --> 36:30.013
So, for what seemed
like an accusatory glance

36:30.057 --> 36:33.887
that I gave you,
I am truly sorry.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.066
But this look?

36:40.676 --> 36:42.112
This look right here

36:42.156 --> 36:43.940
that I'm giving you right now

36:43.984 --> 36:47.422
is a look of...

36:47.466 --> 36:50.773
admiration and appreciation

36:50.817 --> 36:52.384
and of respect.

36:53.298 --> 36:56.779
It is a look of love
and of apology.

37:01.306 --> 37:02.524
Thank you.

37:09.139 --> 37:12.099
Miss Collins,
you've missed court-mandated

37:12.142 --> 37:13.883
therapy sessions,
you've missed A.A. meetings,

37:13.927 --> 37:16.364
you're someone
who does not obey rules.

37:16.408 --> 37:17.670
That is a problem.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.412
Having said all that,
I strongly believe

37:20.455 --> 37:23.241
in a concerted effort
to strengthen the relationship

37:23.284 --> 37:26.287
between parents involved in
the system and their children.

37:27.332 --> 37:29.290
Miss Lopez is right,
you've been through a lot

37:29.334 --> 37:32.380
and I'm convinced you never put
your children in harm's way.

37:33.076 --> 37:35.209
I'm ruling that your
children be returned to you

37:35.253 --> 37:37.820
while you serve out the terms
of your plea agreement.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.257
Thank you.

37:39.300 --> 37:41.781
Thank you so much.

37:59.015 --> 38:00.756
We sent
the blood for processing

38:00.800 --> 38:02.323
and we found that
the genetic profile

38:02.367 --> 38:05.021
generated from the blood
found on the victim's body

38:05.065 --> 38:07.894
was consistent
with Carl Brewer's DNA profile.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.332
Thank you.

38:11.376 --> 38:12.812
Mr. Watkins.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.294
Miss Reed.

38:16.337 --> 38:18.470
Just to be clear,
you told this Jury

38:18.513 --> 38:21.473
that the DNA from the victim
and the DNA from my client

38:21.516 --> 38:24.084
matched to a certainty of,
what was it,

38:24.127 --> 38:26.478
- one in 19 billion?
- Correct. Right.

38:26.521 --> 38:28.784
19 billion,
that's a big number.

38:28.828 --> 38:30.438
Three times
the total population

38:30.482 --> 38:32.310
of humans on the planet.

38:33.006 --> 38:35.269
Even with that certainty,
wouldn't you say that

38:35.313 --> 38:38.011
there are circumstances
in which DNA can change?

38:38.054 --> 38:39.404
Change? Uh.

38:39.447 --> 38:41.797
It's possible,
but extraordinarily rare.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.277
I want to
show you something.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.413
Know what this is,
Miss Reed?

38:49.849 --> 38:50.937
It's a Chimera.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.678
A Chimera.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.549
Comes from
Greek mythology,

38:54.593 --> 38:55.985
right?
Yes.

38:56.029 --> 38:57.857
A fire-breathing monster.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.163
A hybrid creature
made up of three different

39:00.207 --> 39:03.166
animal parts:
A lion, the body of a goat,

39:03.210 --> 39:04.690
and a snake's head for a tail.

39:05.212 --> 39:07.345
- Beautiful, actually.
- Your Honor, relevance.

39:07.388 --> 39:10.478
Overruled, I want to see
where this is going.

39:10.522 --> 39:12.480
But we're not
talking about Greek mythology,

39:12.524 --> 39:13.873
are we Mrs. Reed.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.310
Tell us how
this beautiful creature

39:16.354 --> 39:18.791
connects
to the medical definition.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.227
In medicine,

39:20.270 --> 39:23.186
Chimera refers
to a hybrid human.

39:23.230 --> 39:25.363
Someone who could be
carrying two totally different

39:25.406 --> 39:27.408
sets of DNA
inside their body.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.368
So, let's say
if someone received a procedure

39:30.411 --> 39:33.414
like, say,
a bone marrow transplant,

39:33.458 --> 39:35.503
that person
could be a Chimera, yes?

39:35.547 --> 39:37.810
They could be carrying
two distinct sets of DNA,

39:37.853 --> 39:40.813
one of the recipient
and one of the donor, right?

39:43.163 --> 39:44.860
Sorry,
I didn't hear you, Miss Reed.

39:44.904 --> 39:47.036
- Human Chimerism is rare.
- Rare, yes,

39:47.080 --> 39:49.038
but it is possible
under these circumstances.

39:49.082 --> 39:51.214
Objection, relevance.
352 in foundation.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.434
Overruled.
Continue, Mr. Watkins.

39:53.478 --> 39:56.742
Miss Reed,
if you learned that Mr. Brewer

39:56.785 --> 40:00.485
had a bone marrow transplant,
would that change your opinion

40:00.528 --> 40:03.575
regarding the probability
of the DNA evidence.

40:04.402 --> 40:05.881
Your Honor,

40:05.925 --> 40:07.927
marking defense exhibit W.

40:08.754 --> 40:12.540
Carl Brewer's medical records
from 1987 showing he received

40:12.584 --> 40:14.237
a bone marrow transplant

40:14.281 --> 40:16.022
from the California
Cancer Organization.

40:16.065 --> 40:18.633
Your Honor,
objection on prior grounds.

40:18.677 --> 40:21.288
The defense just violated
the court's rulings to prohibit

40:21.331 --> 40:23.333
the mention of the defendant's
medical record.

40:23.377 --> 40:25.466
The court didn't tell me
not to present evidence from

40:25.510 --> 40:28.295
a medical procedure that my
client received 35 years ago.

40:28.338 --> 40:30.471
You serious, Watkins?
- Bailiff, remove the jury.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.778
I ask that the evidence be
excluded and that the jurors--

40:32.821 --> 40:34.519
be instructed to disregard it.
Those records include

40:34.562 --> 40:36.259
recurrent medical records
as well as the fact that

40:36.303 --> 40:37.957
Mr. Brewer received a bone
marrow transplant.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.480
Watkins,
are you serious right now?

40:39.524 --> 40:41.264
I complied with the court's
discovery rules

40:41.308 --> 40:43.136
as well as
the court's 402 rulings.

40:43.179 --> 40:46.313
Council,
you are both out of order.

40:46.356 --> 40:47.923
I want to see you
in my chambers.

40:47.967 --> 40:49.098
Now.
