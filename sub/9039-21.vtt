WEBVTT

00:05.233 --> 00:06.500
- OH, HI, DEAR.
- HEY.

00:06.500 --> 00:08.033
- YA HUNGRY?

00:08.033 --> 00:09.700
- NAH, I'M GOOD.
DEBRA MADE LUNCH.

00:09.700 --> 00:11.833
[both laugh]

00:11.833 --> 00:13.567
I'M HUNGRY. COME ON.

00:13.567 --> 00:17.633
- OH, A WONDERFUL
SENSE OF HUMOR.

00:17.633 --> 00:21.433
ROBBIE, I'M GONNA DO A LOAD
OF YOUR SOCKS AND UNDERPANTS.

00:21.433 --> 00:25.833
ARE YOU WEARING TODAY'S
UNDERPANTS OR YESTERDAY'S?

00:25.833 --> 00:27.300
- THEY'RE FINE, MA.

00:27.300 --> 00:28.500
- NO, NO. LET ME SEE.
- NO, NO, NO.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.567
NO, NO, NO, NO!
- NO, NO, NO!

00:30.567 --> 00:33.000
- NO. COME ON!

00:33.000 --> 00:34.500
- ROBERT!

00:34.500 --> 00:36.467
YOU KNOW THE MOST IMPORTANT
PANTS A PERSON HAS?

00:36.467 --> 00:38.267
UNDERPANTS.
- I KNOW, MA.

00:38.267 --> 00:40.400
- YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU RAN OUT
OF UNDERPANTS THAT TIME?

00:40.400 --> 00:43.200
- IT WAS THE FIFTH GRADE, MA.

00:43.200 --> 00:44.633
- AND YOU HAD TO WEAR

00:44.633 --> 00:46.533
A PAIR OF RAYMOND'S UNDERPANTS
TO SCHOOL?

00:46.533 --> 00:50.267
- EW!
YOU NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.667
- I'M CHECKING YOUR DRESSER.

00:53.433 --> 00:55.133
- HEY, RAY, YOU HEAR
MY IMITATION

00:55.133 --> 00:56.767
OF ROBERT'S TUSHY CUSHION?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.667
"HOW ABOUT A SALAD, FATSO?"

01:03.500 --> 01:04.567
A SALAD.

01:07.700 --> 01:08.767
OH, MAN.

01:11.833 --> 01:15.200
- TALKING TUSHY CUSHION.
THAT'S CLEVER.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.467
- YEAH, YOU SHOULD
HEAR HIS NEW BIT

01:16.467 --> 01:19.267
ABOUT THE TOILET SEAT
TALKING TO ME.

01:19.267 --> 01:21.700
- HOW DO YOU DO IT?
HOW DO YOU LIVE WITH THEM?

01:21.700 --> 01:24.333
IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE
WIPING OFF MY FINGERPRINTS

01:24.333 --> 01:26.300
AND REHEARSING MY 911 CALL.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.167
- WELL, YOU GET USED TO 'EM,
YOU KNOW?

01:33.167 --> 01:36.100
IT'S LIKE AN IMPACTED
WISDOM TOOTH.

01:36.100 --> 01:38.967
WITHOUT THE WISDOM.

01:38.967 --> 01:40.600
- MY TV GUIDE IS MISSING.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.267
I LEFT IT ON ARMREST
OF THE SOFA,

01:42.267 --> 01:44.233
AND NOW IT'S NOT
ON ARMREST OF THE SOFA.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.900
WHERE IS MY TV GUIDE?

01:46.900 --> 01:48.600
- MA HAD IT LAST.

01:48.600 --> 01:50.400
- MARIE, TV GUIDE!

01:54.100 --> 01:57.567
- YEAH.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.600
GOT TO HAVE
A LITTLE FUN, RIGHT?

02:03.800 --> 02:07.133
- DID YOU DO THAT YOURSELF?

02:50.400 --> 02:51.367
- SO THIS IS GOOD, HUH?

02:52.333 --> 02:54.633
YOU AND ME WATCHING
THE BALL GAME.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.833
- OH, YEAH.
YEAH, THIS IS NICE.

02:57.833 --> 02:59.767
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
ANOTHER GAME NEXT WEEK.

02:59.767 --> 03:03.367
- SHUT UP. IT'S BACK ON.

03:03.367 --> 03:06.367
- HEY.
LISTEN, IS ROBERT AROUND?

03:06.367 --> 03:08.800
- MARIE TOOK HIM TO HIS
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.000
- OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU GUYS.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.467
- AH, GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY.
WHAT?

03:14.467 --> 03:15.667
- NOW, LISTEN. LISTEN UP.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.000
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

03:17.000 --> 03:18.433
WHAT TO GET ROBERT
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

03:18.433 --> 03:21.333
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL I HAVE IS A TEN.

03:21.333 --> 03:25.200
CAN THIS BE FOR
CHRISTMAS TOO?

03:25.200 --> 03:28.733
- HEY, CAN I GO
HALVSIES WITH YA?

03:28.733 --> 03:30.567
- OKAY, YOU KNOW,
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY

03:30.567 --> 03:32.233
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING
NICE FOR ROBERT.

03:32.233 --> 03:33.767
BECAUSE NOT ONLY DID
HE GET GORED BY A BULL,

03:33.767 --> 03:35.833
BUT HE'S HAD TO PUT UP
WITH THAT KIND OF STUFF

03:35.833 --> 03:38.300
FOR THREE MONTHS.

03:38.300 --> 03:43.133
- WHAT DOES SHE WANT,
ANOTHER TEN?

03:43.133 --> 03:45.533
- HEY, HOW DID ROBERT'S
APPOINTMENT GO?

03:45.533 --> 03:46.567
- NOT GOOD.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.333
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.600
- WELL, I ASKED THE DOCTOR
ABOUT THE CLICKING IN MY JAW

03:50.600 --> 03:52.067
WHEN I CHEW SOMETIMES...

03:52.067 --> 03:55.933
AND HE SAID THERE ISN'T MUCH
I COULD REALLY DO ABOUT IT.

03:55.933 --> 03:58.567
- I HAVE A SUGGESTION.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.633
- WHAT ABOUT ROBERT?

04:01.633 --> 04:04.267
- OH, NO, HE'S GOOD.
HIS THERAPY'S GOING VERY WELL.

04:04.267 --> 04:05.567
IN FACT, HE CAN MOVE

04:05.567 --> 04:07.667
BACK INTO HIS APARTMENT
IN THREE WEEKS.

04:07.667 --> 04:10.367
- OH, MY GOD,
ANOTHER THREE WEEKS?

04:13.933 --> 04:16.433
- HEY, ROBERT.
- HEY, ROBERT!

04:16.433 --> 04:18.700
- WELL, I SUPPOSE YOU HEARD
MY WONDERFUL NEWS.

04:18.700 --> 04:22.200
- YEAH, THREE MORE WEEKS.
- THREE MORE WEEKS.

04:22.200 --> 04:25.733
- OH, LISTEN--[in a perky tone]
THREE MORE WEEKS.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.600
- WELL, IF YOU SAY IT LIKE THAT.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.100
HERE, LET ME TRY...

04:29.100 --> 04:31.167
[in a mock perky tone]
BUBONIC PLAGUE.

04:37.767 --> 04:42.100
- HEY, WHAT DO YOU GOT?
IS THAT A NEW CUSHION?

04:42.100 --> 04:45.133
WHOO.
BOY, I WISH I HAD ONE OF THOSE.

04:45.133 --> 04:47.600
MAN, THAT IS...SWEET.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.433
- ROBBIE, THREE MORE WEEKS
IS NOT SO BAD.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.833
YOUR FATHER AND I WILL HELP YOU
WITH YOUR STRETCHING.

04:54.833 --> 04:56.733
- I JUST WANT TO SAY,
IF YOU DO THE ONE

04:56.733 --> 04:58.633
WHERE YOU THROW
YOUR LEGS OVER YOUR HEAD,

04:58.633 --> 05:01.600
ALL BAGGAGE MUST BE
COMPLETELY STOWED.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.600
- ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD AND LAUGH.
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE ELSE DOES.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.100
- ROBERT, LISTEN, WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT YOUR BIRTHDAY.

05:11.100 --> 05:13.333
- OH, YEAH, YEAH, MY BIRTHDAY.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.767
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
TO THE MIDDLE-AGED MAN

05:14.767 --> 05:18.867
WHO'S BACK LIVING
WITH HIS PARENTS.

05:18.867 --> 05:20.600
- [singing]
AND MANY MORE

05:31.500 --> 05:33.033
- OH, YOU DRANK
ALL THE COFFEE.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.433
[muttering]

05:38.800 --> 05:41.600
- RAYMOND.
- HELLO, SON.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.433
- HEY.

05:42.433 --> 05:43.667
WE WERE JUST
HAVING SOME COFFEE.

05:43.667 --> 05:45.133
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO MAKE YOU SOME?

05:45.133 --> 05:46.133
- NO, NO, THANKS.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.533
- UH, HOW ARE YOU?

05:48.533 --> 05:51.267
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:51.267 --> 05:52.833
- WHY'D YOU TELL ME
TO COME OVER?

05:52.833 --> 05:55.067
- WHAT?
WE LIKE YOU.

05:55.067 --> 05:58.833
CAN'T WE JUST WANT TO SEE YOU?
I MEAN, IS THAT SUCH A CRAZY--

05:58.833 --> 06:00.100
ROBERT'S KILLING US.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.967
- I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

06:01.967 --> 06:03.300
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:03.300 --> 06:05.200
- YOUR BROTHER.
HE'S A JERK.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.467
- NO, HE'S NOT A JERK, FRANK.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.900
- HE'S ACTS LIKE
IT'S SO HORRIBLE

06:07.900 --> 06:09.233
HAVING TO STAY HERE WITH US.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.400
IT'S NOT PONY RIDE
FOR US, EITHER.

06:11.400 --> 06:13.100
- HE WON'T EVEN
DO HIS EXERCISES.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.233
HE JUST SITS AROUND
THE HOUSE INSULTING US.

06:15.233 --> 06:19.433
THIS MORNING, HE TOLD ME
THAT MY PANCAKES WERE...DRY.

06:19.433 --> 06:22.633
- AND YESTERDAY, HE TOLD ME
I SMELLED LIKE A BILLY GOAT.

06:22.633 --> 06:27.000
- WHICH WASN'T TRUE
YESTERDAY.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.333
RAYMOND,
PLEASE TALK TO HIM.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.500
- WHAT?
NO, NO. NO WAY.

06:30.500 --> 06:31.867
- COME ON.
HE'S YOUR BROTHER.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.367
- HE'S YOUR SON!

06:33.367 --> 06:35.267
- YOU'RE GONNA THROW THAT
IN MY FACE?

06:35.267 --> 06:37.000
- RAYMOND, WE DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE TO DO.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.700
- WELL, LOOK, HE'S PROBABLY JUST
GOING STIR CRAZY HERE, HUH?

06:40.700 --> 06:45.067
I HAVE AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS MOVE?

06:45.067 --> 06:49.100
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

06:49.100 --> 06:51.100
- HMM...

06:51.100 --> 06:52.600
I'LL TALK TO HIM.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.867
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WOULD WANT US TO--

06:54.867 --> 06:57.033
- I'M TALKING TO HIM!

06:59.967 --> 07:01.333
HEY. WHAT, ARE YOU STRETCHING?

07:01.333 --> 07:05.333
- NO, I DROPPED A FRUIT LOOP
UNDER THE COUCH.

07:17.533 --> 07:20.000
- AH...

07:20.000 --> 07:23.900
SO, MOM AND DAD
STARTING TO GET TO YOU?

07:23.900 --> 07:26.433
- STARTING TO GET TO ME?

07:26.433 --> 07:28.067
THEY'VE
BURROWED INTO MY HEAD,

07:28.067 --> 07:31.133
AND THEY SIT ON MY BRAIN,
POKING THE BACKS OF MY EYES.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.300
- YEAH, THEY'LL DO THAT.

07:40.633 --> 07:44.567
BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CUT 'EM SOME SLACK.

07:44.567 --> 07:45.867
- WHAT?

07:45.867 --> 07:49.600
- YEAH, 'CAUSE THEY
MEAN WELL, YOU KNOW?

07:49.600 --> 07:52.533
WELL, MOM MEANS WELL.
DAD'S JUST MEAN.

07:55.133 --> 07:57.100
- WHAT, THEY SEND YOU
IN HERE TO TALK TO ME?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.567
- NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

07:59.567 --> 08:00.967
- COME ON, RAY.

08:00.967 --> 08:04.300
EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE
MA'S LITTLE LAP DOG.

08:04.300 --> 08:05.800
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

08:05.800 --> 08:08.000
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE GIVES YOU TREATS,

08:08.000 --> 08:12.400
AND YOU SCAMPER AROUND DOING
TRICKS LIKE A TRAINED POODLE.

08:12.400 --> 08:17.033
I THINK I'LL START
CALLING YOU PRINCESS.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.267
- I'M NOT A POODLE, ROBERT.

08:19.267 --> 08:22.267
- PRINCESS
WANT A FRUIT WOOP?

08:22.267 --> 08:23.500
- WHAT, ARE YOU JUST GONNA BE,

08:23.500 --> 08:25.900
LIKE, A PAIN IN THE ASS
TO EVERYBODY?

08:25.900 --> 08:29.067
- AH, YEAH, YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
PAIN THE ASS. I GET IT.

08:29.067 --> 08:31.900
- THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT, HUH?
COME ON!

08:31.900 --> 08:33.300
- DON'T ACT SO INNOCENT, OKAY?

08:33.300 --> 08:36.900
YOU WERE THE FIRST ONE
TO FIND HUMOR IN MY...

08:36.900 --> 08:40.200
DISCOMFORTURE.

08:40.200 --> 08:43.467
YEAH, YEAH, THANKS FOR
THE LAUGHS, FUNNY MAN.

08:43.467 --> 08:45.033
- WHAT, SO NOW YOU'RE
GONNA BE MAD AT ME NOW

08:45.033 --> 08:47.733
JUST 'CAUSE YOU GOT TO
SPEND THREE MORE WEEKS HERE?

08:47.733 --> 08:54.200
- OH, HOW COULD I BE MAD
AT YOU...PRINCESS?

08:54.200 --> 08:55.433
- GOD, YOU ARE A JERK.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.733
- HOW'D IT GO IN THERE?

09:12.733 --> 09:16.800
- YEAH, I STUCK MY FINGERS
IN HIS FRUIT LOOPS.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.800
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?
GET BACK IN THERE.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.200
- NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, HE'S OUT OF HIS MIND.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.733
- NO, DON'T LEAVE,
RAYMOND, PLEASE.

09:22.733 --> 09:25.400
HERE, HAVE A BROWNIE.

09:25.400 --> 09:27.567
- ONE.

09:27.567 --> 09:32.800
- AH, A TWEAT
FOR MOMMY'S SCHNOOKUMS.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.000
- MA, TELL HIM
I'M NOT YOUR LAP DOG.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.800
- HE'S NOT MY LAP DOG,
ROBERT.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.000
- I JUST WAN TO THANK EVERYBODY
FOR BEING SUCH A LOVING FAMILY.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.367
I'M IN THERE
WITH A BULL HOLE IN ME,

09:42.367 --> 09:44.033
AND YOU'RE ALL IN HERE
CALLING ME JERK.

09:44.033 --> 09:45.933
THAT'S NICE.

09:45.933 --> 09:48.267
- HEY, IF YOU'RE HAVING SUCH
A BAD TIME LIVING HERE,

09:48.267 --> 09:49.867
THEN DON'T.

09:49.867 --> 09:50.933
- YOU WANT ME OUT?

09:50.933 --> 09:53.200
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO FINISH YOUR REHAB HERE, MAN.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.200
JUST MOVE OUT.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.667
- THAT'S RIGHT.

09:55.667 --> 09:58.533
YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH BACK
ON YOUR BIG CLOWN FEET.

09:58.533 --> 10:02.800
- MY FEET ARE PROPORTIONATE
TO MY HEIGHT,

10:02.800 --> 10:03.800
AND MAYBE I WILL MOVE OUT.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.233
WOULD YOU LIKE THAT, MA?

10:05.233 --> 10:08.200
- WHATEVER MAKES YOU HAPPY,
DEAR.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.033
- OKAY, FINE,
I'M GOING RIGHT NOW.

10:10.033 --> 10:11.300
- GOOD!

10:11.300 --> 10:13.200
- I'LL BE BACK FOR
MY PERSONAL EFFECTS TOMORROW.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.200
- TAKE YOUR TIME.

10:14.200 --> 10:15.433
- I'M OUT OF HERE!

10:19.767 --> 10:22.000
YOU GOT TO MOVE YOUR CAR.
IT'S BLOCKING ME.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.900
- MY PLEASURE!
MARIE, MOVE THE CAR.

10:24.900 --> 10:26.400
- I DON'T HAVE YOUR KEYS.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.267
- I DON'T HAVE THEM.
YOU'RE ALWAYS HIDING THEM.

10:28.267 --> 10:29.633
- NOBODY HIDES YOUR KEYS, FRANK.

10:29.633 --> 10:31.633
IF YOU'D JUST PUT 'EM
ON THE HOOK WHERE THEY BELONG.

10:31.633 --> 10:33.167
- DON'T TELL ME
TO PUT 'EM ON THE HOOK.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.333
I HATE PUTTING THEM ON THE HOOK.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.600
- ARE THEY IN
YOUR PANTS UPSTAIRS?

10:35.600 --> 10:37.600
- I DON'T LEAVE MY KEYS
IN MY PANTS.

10:37.600 --> 10:41.667
HOW ABOUT THE TIME YOU LEFT 'EM
IN THE FRONT DOOR, SENILE?

10:41.667 --> 10:43.467
- HOW ABOUT THE TIME
YOU HAD 'EM IN YOUR HANDS?

10:43.467 --> 10:46.433
"WHERE ARE MY KEYS?
WHERE ARE MY KEYS?"

10:46.433 --> 10:49.200
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, WAIT. I FORGOT.

10:51.933 --> 10:54.133
I HAD 'EM.

10:54.133 --> 10:59.033
AND HERE'S YOUR TV GUIDE,
AND HERE'S YOUR BIG SPOON.

10:59.033 --> 11:01.167
[door slams]

11:03.033 --> 11:04.733
- I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA
BOIL THAT SPOON.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.467
[knocks at door]

11:15.467 --> 11:17.233
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ROBERT.

11:17.233 --> 11:20.300
WE JUST WANTED TO STOP--
- WE?

11:20.300 --> 11:23.067
- COME BACK HERE!

11:23.067 --> 11:25.233
THEY'RE JUST KIDDING,
YOU KNOW.

11:25.233 --> 11:27.900
GET OVER HERE.

11:27.900 --> 11:28.900
[chuckles]

11:28.900 --> 11:30.033
- HI.

11:30.033 --> 11:31.100
- HEY. WHAT'S UP?

11:31.100 --> 11:35.067
- HAPPY...HELLO.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.267
- LET'S GO INSIDE.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.400
- OOH.
- [gasps]

11:39.400 --> 11:42.567
- AAH! OH, GOD!
WHAT THE HELL'S THAT SMELL?

11:42.567 --> 11:45.733
- I LEFT A CARTON OF MILK OUT
THE DAY I GOT GORED BY THE BULL.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.467
APPARENTLY, IF YOU LEAVE
MILK OUT FOR 12 WEEKS,

11:51.467 --> 11:53.367
IT GOES BAD
AND THEN EXPLODES.

11:56.700 --> 12:02.100
HOWEVER, THIS
IS LAVENDER BOUQUET.

12:02.100 --> 12:05.100
- CAN WE USE IT
TO LIGHT THE APARTMENT ON FIRE?

12:05.100 --> 12:06.767
- ROBERT, DO YOU HAVE
ANY MORE CANDLES?

12:06.767 --> 12:11.067
- OR AN OLD SNEAKER
I CAN BURY MY FACE IN?

12:11.067 --> 12:14.000
- MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.167
OR NOT.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.933
- I SAY NOT.

12:18.933 --> 12:20.533
- I HAVE MY PERFUME.

12:20.533 --> 12:24.467
- UH, YEAH,
THAT'S GOOD, MA.

12:24.467 --> 12:27.233
NOW IT SMELLS LIKE A COW
DIED IN A WHOREHOUSE.

12:31.900 --> 12:34.233
- OKAY, WHY DON'T WE OPEN
A WINDOW, HUH?

12:34.233 --> 12:37.633
- YEAH.
AND JUMP OUT.

12:37.633 --> 12:42.333
- OH, IS THAT
THE CAKE YOU MADE?

12:42.333 --> 12:45.100
- YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD'VE MADE ONE, MARIE.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.467
- THE WAY ROBERT'S
BEHAVING?

12:46.467 --> 12:48.567
NO, HE DOESN'T DESERVE
ONE OF MY CAKES.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.600
THIS IS PERFECT.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.300
- OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.100
I THINK WE ALL NEED TO BE

12:56.100 --> 12:57.767
A LITTLE MORE UNDERSTANDING
OF ROBERT.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.000
THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

13:00.000 --> 13:04.200
IS THAT SOME OF YOUR "I'M OKAY,
YOU'RE OKAY" HIPPY CRAP?

13:05.967 --> 13:08.033
- NO. IT'S JUST RIGHT.

13:08.033 --> 13:10.200
- PEACE, MAN.

13:12.267 --> 13:15.000
- OH, YOU'RE STILL HERE.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.933
- WE'RE NOT GONNA LEAVE, ROBERT.
IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY!

13:17.933 --> 13:20.500
AND BY THE WAY,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.333
IT'S FROM ALL OF US.
HUH?

13:23.333 --> 13:25.367
IT'S A GYM MEMBERSHIP.

13:25.367 --> 13:26.767
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.
LET'S GO.

13:26.767 --> 13:28.100
- RAY...

13:28.100 --> 13:29.433
WAIT A MINUTE.

13:29.433 --> 13:31.033
- AH, PICTURES
OF BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE

13:31.033 --> 13:33.567
RUNNING AND ROWING
AND LIFTING WEIGHTS.

13:33.567 --> 13:34.900
- NICE, HUH?

13:34.900 --> 13:37.200
- YEAH, YEAH, EVERYBODY CAN
BUILD UP THEIR ARM MUSCLES

13:37.200 --> 13:41.200
POINTING AND LAUGHING
AT SERGEANT CHUBSY-UBSY.

13:41.200 --> 13:43.733
- ROBERT, WE JUST THOUGHT
THAT IT MIGHT HELP YOU.

13:43.733 --> 13:45.800
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, DEB--
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT, HUH?

13:45.800 --> 13:49.033
YOU CAN GO AND EXERCISE
AND LOSE, LIKE, HALF A POUND

13:49.033 --> 13:51.333
AND THEN OFFICIALLY
BE PERFECT.

13:51.333 --> 13:54.100
[singing]
PERFECT DEBRA, SITTING IN A TREE

13:54.100 --> 13:58.133
P-E-R-F-E-C-T

13:58.133 --> 14:01.333
- HEY,
THAT RHYMES.

14:01.333 --> 14:03.733
- LOOK, ROBERT,
WE WERE JUST--

14:03.733 --> 14:06.133
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, LISTEN,
THANKS FOR THE PRESENT.

14:06.133 --> 14:07.400
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

14:07.400 --> 14:09.200
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING,
EVERYBODY, OKAY?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.233
YOU MAY JUST WANT TO GO NOW,
BECAUSE THE BIRTHDAY BOY

14:11.233 --> 14:12.733
IS GONNA BLOW OUT
THE CANDLE.

14:19.833 --> 14:21.367
- JUST FOR THE RECORD,

14:21.367 --> 14:25.133
I SAID WE SHOULD GET HIM
A STRIP-O-GRAM.

14:25.133 --> 14:27.200
- I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.167
- OH, DEB, JUST STOP IT
WITH THE UNDERSTANDING BIT.

14:30.167 --> 14:32.667
- IT'S NOT A BIT, RAY.

14:32.667 --> 14:34.667
- YOU KNOW, IF DEBRA REALLY
UNDERSTOOD PEOPLE,

14:34.667 --> 14:36.433
SHE WOULDN'T
SERVE THAT CAKE.

14:42.133 --> 14:44.867
- HEY!

14:44.867 --> 14:46.267
- OKAY, ROBERT, LISTEN.

14:46.267 --> 14:47.733
STOP FEELING SO SORRY
FOR YOURSELF.

14:47.733 --> 14:49.833
- I'M NOT FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF.

14:49.833 --> 14:51.267
- YES, YOU ARE.

14:51.267 --> 14:53.333
SPOUTING OFF AT THE FAMILY
AND INSULTING EVERYBODY.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.233
YOU JUST LOVE PLAYING
THE VICTIM, DON'T YOU?

14:55.233 --> 14:56.667
- OKAY, THANK YOU, DEBRA.

14:56.667 --> 14:59.400
YOU CAN GO BACK TO BEING
PRINCESS FABULOSA NOW.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.700
- HEY, YOU BETTER
BE NICE TO ME, PAL,

15:01.700 --> 15:03.400
BECAUSE I'M THE LAST PERSON
IN THE FAMILY

15:03.400 --> 15:04.900
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO
CLIMB UP THERE

15:04.900 --> 15:06.800
AND STRANGLE YOU!

15:06.800 --> 15:09.367
- OH, A HEIGHT JOKE.
THANK YOU, YOUR MAJESTY.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.733
YEAH, IT'S VERY REFRESHING

15:10.733 --> 15:13.767
AFTER ALL
THE BULL-IN-THE-ASS JOKES.

15:13.767 --> 15:17.467
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
I THINK YOU LOVE THAT BULL.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.267
I THINK YOU WERE SO HAPPY
HE FOUND YOU,

15:19.267 --> 15:21.400
BECAUSE HE'S A TWO-TON EXCUSE
FOR YOUR LIFE!

15:21.400 --> 15:23.367
THAT'S RIGHT, YOU WERE
A VICTIM BEFORE THAT BULL.

15:23.367 --> 15:24.933
YOU'VE BEEN A VICTIM
YOUR WHOLE LIFE,

15:24.933 --> 15:26.433
BECAUSE THERE'S
NOTHING EASIER

15:26.433 --> 15:28.967
THAN PLAYING THE VICTIM,
IS THERE, ROBERT?

15:28.967 --> 15:31.267
- WHY ARE YOU PICKING ON ME?

15:31.267 --> 15:32.833
- SEE?
AGAIN.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.367
"WAH-WAH-WAH.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.233
MY MOTHER DOESN'T
PAY ENOUGH ATTENTION TO ME.

15:36.233 --> 15:38.100
"I BROKE UP WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

15:38.100 --> 15:40.000
"RAYMOND HAS A BETTER LIFE
THAN ME.

15:40.000 --> 15:43.867
WAH-WAH-WAH."

15:43.867 --> 15:45.267
- I DON'T SAY, "WAH-WAH-WAH."

15:45.267 --> 15:46.767
- YOU'RE SOUNDING
LIKE THAT RIGHT NOW.

15:46.767 --> 15:50.333
- THAT'S BECAUSE I JUST SAID,
"WAH-WAH-WAH."

15:50.333 --> 15:52.000
LISTEN,
BAD STUFF HAPPENS TO ME, OKAY?

15:52.000 --> 15:53.167
I DON'T IMAGINE
THESE THINGS.

15:53.167 --> 15:54.300
I'M JUST REPORTING THE FACTS.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.533
- THE FACT IS,
YOU LOVE TO SUFFER.

15:55.533 --> 15:56.733
THAT'S WHY YOU WERE SO MAD

15:56.733 --> 15:59.100
ABOUT HAVING TO LEAVE
YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

15:59.100 --> 16:00.400
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

16:00.400 --> 16:01.900
I COULDN'T
WAIT TO GET OUT OF THERE.

16:01.900 --> 16:03.167
- OH, REALLY?

16:03.167 --> 16:04.467
YOU DON'T SEEM SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE.

16:04.467 --> 16:08.200
- I HAVE A MILK SITUATION.

16:08.200 --> 16:09.900
- ADMIT IT, ROBERT.

16:09.900 --> 16:11.800
YOU LOVE BEING AT
YOUR PARENTS' HOUSE,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.333
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE HOLY LAND OF SELF-PITY.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.867
YOU WEREN'T UNHAPPY
BECAUSE YOU HAD

16:15.867 --> 16:17.067
THREE MORE WEEKS
TO STAY THERE.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.500
YOU WERE UNHAPPY BECAUSE

16:18.500 --> 16:20.433
YOU ONLY HAD THREE MORE WEEKS
TO STAY THERE!

16:25.700 --> 16:28.300
- [sobbing] OH, MY GOD!

16:33.500 --> 16:37.367
OH, MY GOD!

16:37.367 --> 16:39.867
- ROBERT--
- MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, DEBRA!

16:39.867 --> 16:44.133
- NO, I'M NOT. I'M NOT RIGHT.
STOP CRYING.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.867
- SURE, I PUT ON A BIG SHOW

16:45.867 --> 16:49.933
ABOUT HOW MA LOVES RAYMOND
BETTER AND DAD'S AN OGRE,

16:49.933 --> 16:53.700
BUT THEY DO TAKE CARE OF ME!

16:53.700 --> 16:55.433
- OKAY.

16:55.433 --> 16:57.533
- I GOT A PLACE TO SLEEP,

16:57.533 --> 16:59.067
LAUNDRY,

16:59.067 --> 17:02.467
THE FOOD IS UNBELIEVABLE.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.633
HER LASAGNA.
HER PIE.

17:06.633 --> 17:08.800
EVEN SOMETHING AS SIMPLE
AS CREAM OF WHEAT,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.800
WHICH YOU WOULDN'T THINK
WOULD BE DIFFERENT

17:10.800 --> 17:12.433
FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER,

17:12.433 --> 17:15.567
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
BUT HERS IS BETTER.

17:18.767 --> 17:20.667
- ROBERT, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SUGGEST--

17:20.667 --> 17:22.533
- OH, MY GOD.

17:22.533 --> 17:25.367
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I NEVER WANTED
TO MOVE OUT OF THERE.

17:25.367 --> 17:28.367
WHAT KIND OF A NUT JOB AM I?
NUT JOB! NUT JOB!

17:28.367 --> 17:30.367
- NO, NO, NO, ROBERT,
YOU'RE NOT!

17:30.367 --> 17:32.600
- YOU'RE RIGHT, DEBRA.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:32.600 --> 17:35.200
MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO
GET BETTER.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.067
I MUST LOVE
BEING THE VICTIM.

17:37.067 --> 17:39.200
OH, MY GOD!
I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.633
LOOK AT ME.
I DON'T THINK I CAN STOP, DEBRA.

17:41.633 --> 17:44.667
I DON'T THINK
I'M EVER GONNA STOP!

17:44.667 --> 17:46.767
HELP ME OUT OF THIS!

17:46.767 --> 17:49.167
PLEASE HELP ME OUT OF THIS.

17:49.167 --> 17:51.233
- ROBERT, YOU'RE CRUSHING ME.

17:51.233 --> 17:53.467
- OH, MY GOD!

17:53.467 --> 17:55.900
I AM A NUT JOB!

17:55.900 --> 17:57.567
[blubbering]

18:02.033 --> 18:06.267
- I'M A LOSER.
I AM SUCH A LOSER.

18:06.267 --> 18:09.533
- OH, ROBERT, NO. COME ON.
ROBERT, LOOK. NO, LISTEN.

18:09.533 --> 18:10.833
YOU'RE NOT SO--

18:10.833 --> 18:14.000
LISTEN, I FEEL SORRY
FOR MYSELF TOO, SOMETIMES.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.367
- NOT LIKE ME.
I GOT ISSUES.

18:17.367 --> 18:18.867
- NO, I HAVE MY MOMENTS.

18:18.867 --> 18:22.167
- YEAH, YOU.
LIKE WHAT?

18:22.167 --> 18:25.133
- LIKE, OKAY,
FOR INSTANCE,

18:25.133 --> 18:27.400
YOU KNOW, I GREW UP IN
A NICE, NORMAL FAMILY.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.400
I WAS USED TO PEOPLE
BEING A CERTAIN WAY.

18:29.400 --> 18:33.967
AND THEN I MARRIED YOUR BROTHER,
WHICH IS GREAT, BUT...

18:33.967 --> 18:36.867
THEY ARE OVER
EVERY DAY...A LOT.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.667
"HELLO, DEAR." "HOLY CRAP."
"HELLO, DEAR." "HOLY CRAP."

18:43.367 --> 18:45.500
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, ON FRIDAY,

18:45.500 --> 18:48.500
YOUR MOTHER WAS OVER NINE TIMES
IN ONE DAY.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.700
NINE TIMES.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.200
AND AT TIMES LIKE THAT,

18:51.200 --> 18:53.500
IT'S HARD FOR ME
NOT TO SAY, "WHY ME?"

18:53.500 --> 18:58.633
YOU KNOW? WHY ME? WHY? WHY?
WHY? WHY? WHY?

19:00.833 --> 19:03.067
- WHY ME?
IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.

19:03.067 --> 19:05.400
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY
I'VE BEEN THE ONLY ONE

19:05.400 --> 19:07.133
WHO'S BEEN ABLE
TO PUT UP WITH YOU LATELY--

19:07.133 --> 19:10.867
'CAUSE WE'RE
A LITTLE BIT ALIKE.

19:10.867 --> 19:13.533
- YOU THINK SO?

19:13.533 --> 19:15.067
- SURE.

19:19.733 --> 19:23.233
OH, ROBERT.
I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU.

19:23.233 --> 19:25.600
- NO, NO. I DESERVED IT.

19:25.600 --> 19:30.633
I'M SORRY
I CALLED YOU PERFECT.

19:30.633 --> 19:32.800
- IT'S OKAY.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.367
DO YOU FEEL BETTER?

19:34.367 --> 19:39.100
- YEAH. A LITTLE DEHYDRATED.

19:39.100 --> 19:43.100
- COME ON,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

19:43.100 --> 19:45.233
- OKAY.

19:45.233 --> 19:47.467
THANKS, DEBRA.

19:47.467 --> 19:49.567
YOU'RE A GOOD
SISTER-IN-LAW.

19:49.567 --> 19:51.067
- THANKS.

19:51.067 --> 19:53.167
YOU'RE A PRETTY GOOD
BROTHER-IN-LAW.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.600
- SO WE REALLY ARE KIND
OF ALIKE, AREN'T WE?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.167
I MEAN, YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR YOURSELF TOO

20:00.167 --> 20:01.200
WHEN MOM AND DAD
BUG YOU.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.400
- OH, ABSOLUTELY.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.367
- YEAH, BUT THEN,
DEEP DOWN,

20:04.367 --> 20:07.000
YOU REALLY KIND OF
LIKE IT, RIGHT?

20:08.933 --> 20:10.200
- YES.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.933
YES, I DO.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.267
- YEAH.

20:13.267 --> 20:15.433
YOU'RE SICK, TOO.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.867
HEY, EVERYBODY.

20:28.867 --> 20:33.333
JUST WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THE WAY I'VE BEEN LATELY.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.067
DEBRA TALKED TO ME,

20:35.067 --> 20:36.933
AND I'M ACTUALLY
FEELING BETTER NOW,

20:36.933 --> 20:40.500
SO IF YOU CAN ALL FORGIVE ME,
I'M GLAD YOU CAME OVER,

20:40.500 --> 20:42.033
AND LET'S HAVE SOME CAKE.

20:42.033 --> 20:45.133
- WAS THAT YOU
CRYING IN THERE?

20:45.133 --> 20:48.000
- OH, FRANK.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.133
NO, IT'S ALL RIGHT, ROBBIE.

20:51.133 --> 20:53.167
YOU'RE NEVER
TOO BIG TO CRY.

20:53.167 --> 20:55.333
- ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT
BE GETTING CLOSE

20:55.333 --> 20:56.467
TO THE CUTOFF POINT.

21:03.633 --> 21:04.833
- YOU KNOW WHAT, ROBBIE?

21:04.833 --> 21:07.033
YOU NEED TO AIR THIS PLACE
OUT OVERNIGHT,

21:07.033 --> 21:09.367
AND TOMORROW, I'LL COME IN
AND GIVE IT A GOOD ONCE-OVER.

21:09.367 --> 21:10.800
SO TONIGHT,
YOU'LL SLEEP AT OUR HOUSE,

21:10.800 --> 21:14.733
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY ARGUMENT FROM YOU.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.533
- ALL RIGHT,
IF THAT'S WHAT WANT.

21:18.533 --> 21:20.067
- COME ON,
LET'S GO HOME,

21:20.067 --> 21:21.633
AND WE CAN HAVE
THE CAKE THERE.

21:21.633 --> 21:24.267
- OH, NO, NO, NO, DEAR.
I HAVE SOME CAKE AT HOME.

21:24.267 --> 21:26.200
WHY DON'T WE LEAVE
YOUR CAKE HERE?

21:26.200 --> 21:28.267
IT GOES SO WELL
WITH THIS APARTMENT.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.233
- HURTS SO GOOD, HUH?
