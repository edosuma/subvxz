Kyle, this is Malcolm Bryce.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.729
My brother Kyle.

00:19.786 --> 00:23.097
So you're the high school teacher
we've heard about. Welcome!

00:26.627 --> 00:29.164
My nephew says you look like a Protestant.

00:29.229 --> 00:31.732
Oh, by birth. I'm not really religious.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.610
No matter.

00:33.767 --> 00:36.043
Let's get you set up with a Protestant drink.

00:36.103 --> 00:37.138
Come on.

00:45.979 --> 00:49.620
Oh, you look so pretty today, Fiona.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.723
Is that him? Is that the teacher?

00:57.925 --> 00:59.871
What does your Mr. Bryce teach?

00:59.927 --> 01:04.102
He's not "my" Mr. Bryce, but he
teaches geography and history.

(CHUCKLES)

01:07.634 --> 01:09.875
Well, the friendliest one
was your cousin, Aidan.

01:09.937 --> 01:11.473
Mary and Paddy's eldest, right?

01:11.538 --> 01:12.846
Poor Aidan.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.580
He likes talking to people who
don't know about his accident.

01:15.642 --> 01:17.781
He was hit by a horse when he was a kid.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.187
Lost the family jewels.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.418
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.823
That's why he's never been married.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.257
You think they suspected anything?

01:26.553 --> 01:27.691
No.

01:29.356 --> 01:31.802
Wallach. Hold on.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.570
It's your office.

01:35.295 --> 01:36.831
This is Lawson.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.537
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.206
I'll be there as soon as I can.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.682
How could you involve her
in something like this?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.912
And you, Fiona, you're 12 years old.

01:47.975 --> 01:49.477
You have your whole life ahead of you.

01:49.543 --> 01:50.920
It doesn't always seem like it.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.286
Don't be smart.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.758
They're not charging her, but only
because it's her first arrest.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.522
- You're a different story.
- Come on, girl, get in.

01:56.583 --> 01:58.995
Please, this time let me take her.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.430
She belongs with the family.

02:02.222 --> 02:03.565
Get off your high horse, Ann.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.763
Fiona and me ain't the only ones with trouble.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.362
What are you talking about?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.237
It's known.

02:11.298 --> 02:12.402
What?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.079
It's known.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.782
Yeah, 10:00.

We'll work it out.

I have to, Malcolm, for everyone's sake.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.013
I thought this was important to you.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.955
I'm sorry, Malcolm. I have to go.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.606
Ann Lawson, probation officer
for juveniles in Manhattan.

04:24.364 --> 04:27.834
Just a guess, but it probably won't
match the tread marks on her chest.

04:33.306 --> 04:34.478
Oh, God.

04:35.876 --> 04:39.016
By my count, she's been run
over at least 3 times.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.719
And that accounts for all the abrasions.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.058
The door's ajar on the driver's side.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.223
Yeah. These bruises on her front.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.701
She was standing right by the door.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.496
She heard, she turned.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.370
Wham. She didn't have time
to get out of the way.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.804
Or she didn't try.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.413
Maybe she recognized the car.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.107
Or she was drunk?

05:07.340 --> 05:09.946
No, I don't smell any alcohol or food.

05:25.358 --> 05:28.362
Ah. Hot peppers,

05:29.396 --> 05:30.739
blue cheese.

05:31.431 --> 05:32.842
Buffalo wings?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.171
Well,

05:36.603 --> 05:39.982
someone who ate Buffalo wings held her hand.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.947
The left hand, actually.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.146
It wasn't a handshake.

05:45.278 --> 05:46.313
No.

05:47.314 --> 05:49.453
It was someone who knew her well.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.097
Sure, we're famous for them.
Best wings south of Buffalo.

05:54.154 --> 05:55.690
You see her in here last night?

05:55.755 --> 05:57.462
With somebody who ordered your famous wings?

05:57.524 --> 05:59.162
Yeah. Booth 17, back here.

05:59.226 --> 06:01.729
She was with an older guy.
He got here before she did though,

06:01.795 --> 06:03.069
did all the eating and drinking.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.666
Did she seem anxious or nervous to you?

06:05.732 --> 06:08.178
Yeah, all of that. She
didn't even take off her coat.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.613
Sounds like older guy
was getting the brush-off.

06:11.404 --> 06:12.781
How did it end?

06:13.240 --> 06:15.220
She left after half an hour.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.118
He did a couple minutes after that.

06:17.177 --> 06:19.350
I guess he thought he could
still change her mind.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.157
Is that what he looked like he
was doing outside with her,

06:22.215 --> 06:23.785
trying to change her mind?

06:23.850 --> 06:26.694
Well, he came back 20 minutes
later and he looked upset.

06:26.753 --> 06:29.324
Then he asked for directions
to the E train and took off.

06:33.059 --> 06:36.666
If he came here by subway, why would
he need directions back to the subway?

06:36.730 --> 06:39.973
Unless he took a cab, or
drove and had car trouble.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.875
No. He would have had to have a tow.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.281
No, maybe his car trouble
was that his car disappeared.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.016
Maybe he filed a report.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.686
You said your car was parked
across the street from Benson's?

06:56.750 --> 06:59.458
Yes. As a matter of fact,
I was there last night.

06:59.519 --> 07:02.728
Well, as a matter of fact, we knew
that. What were you doing there?

07:02.789 --> 07:04.325
I was meeting a friend.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.563
What's this?

07:06.893 --> 07:09.066
"To Daddy, love, Paul." That's adorable.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.369
- Your son?
- Yes. He's very adorable.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.372
So you're married?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.915
Uh, divorced.

07:18.071 --> 07:21.211
This friend with no name is just a friend?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.413
Her name's Ann. Ann Lawson.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.179
We had a date, very casual.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.685
I don't see what this has to do with my car.

07:28.748 --> 07:31.354
How did your paths cross in the first place?

07:32.385 --> 07:35.423
We met at a conference
on juvenile delinquency.

07:35.488 --> 07:39.061
It's an interest of mine and, you
know, she's a probation officer.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.804
You're an anthropologist, aren't you?

07:41.861 --> 07:45.570
Well, I have PhD's in
anthropology and sociology.

07:45.899 --> 07:49.813
Fearsome Gods. That's a South American tribe.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.340
Wasn't this a bestseller?

07:52.405 --> 07:55.045
Oh, yeah, for non-fiction, years ago.

07:55.275 --> 08:00.088
You participated in blood rituals and warfare.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.717
I didn't participate. I observed.

08:05.752 --> 08:07.629
Uh, The Jukes.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.158
Another best seller?

08:11.224 --> 08:13.602
Well, it was in 1877.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.972
Uh, I'm getting the feeling you're
really not interested in my car.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.971
No, see, we're very interested.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.277
Your casual date was run over last night

08:24.337 --> 08:26.476
in a parking lot near Benson's.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.417
My God, I...

08:32.178 --> 08:35.886
We're especially interested in the
fact that your car was stolen

08:35.948 --> 08:38.828
just around the time Miss Lawson was killed.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.294
And you think...

08:45.725 --> 08:48.228
I'd better, uh, talk to a lawyer.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.836
Make sure he has our card.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.940
The woman dumps him, he runs her over,

08:56.336 --> 08:59.010
reports his car stolen, then ditches it.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.551
That's not much of a plan.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.314
He's not much of a liar, either.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.912
His interest in juvenile delinquency?

09:05.478 --> 09:07.617
No. He has no background in criminology.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.058
DEAKINS: Then maybe it's about her
work, one of her probationers?

09:10.116 --> 09:14.223
She had 43 open cases. She hadn't
violated anyone in over 3 months.

09:14.521 --> 09:18.435
All right. The DMV record on Bryce's car.

09:19.359 --> 09:21.600
It shows an accident 3 months ago.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.243
The driver was Paul Bryce.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.701
The adorable kid was driving?

09:29.035 --> 09:32.881
Bryce was happy to let us believe
that he was still a little kid.

09:33.940 --> 09:36.443
Let's see if he has an adorable record.

09:37.811 --> 09:41.418
He's got a sealed juvie record.
He might be one of her probationers.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.654
Maybe Bryce met Lawson through his kid.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.856
Or maybe not. The kid isn't
one of her current cases.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.365
(PHONE RINGING)

09:49.889 --> 09:52.096
Deakins. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

09:52.625 --> 09:54.627
Which exit? Thanks.

09:55.695 --> 09:58.505
Bryce's car just turned up off
the Whitestone Expressway.

09:58.565 --> 09:59.669
Look.

09:59.732 --> 10:02.440
Ann Lawson was Paul Bryce's
probation officer

10:02.502 --> 10:03.981
for over a year.

10:04.504 --> 10:08.452
6 weeks ago she transferred his
case to another probation officer.

10:09.909 --> 10:11.718
There's no explanation.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.461
- Where you going?
- To Mom's.

10:17.650 --> 10:20.256
Paul, I heard about Ann. You
wanna... you wanna talk?

10:20.320 --> 10:23.164
Talk? I know where you were last night.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.494
You just couldn't leave her alone, could you?

10:26.559 --> 10:28.129
You just couldn't.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.540
(DOOR CLOSES)

10:34.300 --> 10:35.643
Hotwired?

10:37.137 --> 10:40.118
No. That's what they wanted it to look like.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.848
But these wires are for the wipers.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.355
This was definitely an amateur.

10:51.284 --> 10:54.857
I mean, first he reports the car
stolen then gets it washed.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.663
Then goes back to the car theft scenario,

10:58.158 --> 11:01.298
ditches the car and pulls the wrong wires.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.766
How tall do you think Malcolm Bryce is?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.472
6'5", give or take.

11:09.536 --> 11:11.846
The last person to sit in this car

11:13.473 --> 11:14.850
was 5'10" at the most.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.990
5'10". What an adorable height.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.158
Ann asked me to reassign Paul
Bryce to lighten her caseload.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.890
How'd Paul end up on probation?

11:25.952 --> 11:28.933
Uh, when he was 15, he stole
a car with another kid.

11:28.988 --> 11:30.899
There was a firearm found in the vehicle.

11:30.957 --> 11:34.302
It was Paul's first offense.
He got 18 months’ probation.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.998
Here, this is hers.

11:36.062 --> 11:37.871
Did he get along with Miss Lawson?

11:37.931 --> 11:40.605
She never said otherwise.
There's nothing in the file.

11:40.667 --> 11:43.807
The file. Do you... do you
mind if I have a look?

11:43.870 --> 11:45.110
It's locked.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.344
She didn't like people poking in her things.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.886
Ann was very private.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.822
These kids, they often form attachments
to their PO's, isn't that right?

11:52.879 --> 11:54.881
No. We intervene before
things get out of hand.

11:54.948 --> 11:58.020
In any event, we don't
arbitrarily reassign kids.

11:58.084 --> 12:01.395
Did Miss Lawson ever talk
to you about Paul's mother?

12:02.789 --> 12:03.824
No.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.535
Her phone logs show only one
phone call from Mrs. Bryce,

12:07.594 --> 12:10.336
the day before Miss Lawson
had Paul transferred.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.575
JANET: It was about something Paul told me.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.809
He said Ann was taking him to an
exhibit at the Whitney on a Saturday.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.646
It was wishful thinking on his part?

12:20.707 --> 12:23.984
Yes. I called Ann.
Apparently she had no idea.

12:24.377 --> 12:25.754
He had a crush on her.

12:25.812 --> 12:28.122
Is that why she transferred him?

12:28.848 --> 12:32.261
She said that he would do better
with a male probation officer.

12:32.318 --> 12:33.820
How did Paul take it?

12:33.886 --> 12:36.093
I think he suspected that I
had something to do with it,

12:36.155 --> 12:39.364
because a few days later
he moved in with his father.

12:39.425 --> 12:44.374
Your ex-husband, he told us that he had
an interest in juvenile delinquency.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.376
Is that because of what happened to Paul?

12:46.432 --> 12:49.413
Well, that's how Malcolm
deals with personal problems.

12:49.469 --> 12:50.573
He studies them.

12:50.637 --> 12:54.210
There would have had to been some
kind of sociological force at work?

12:54.274 --> 12:55.344
Yes.

12:55.541 --> 13:00.047
By the way, do you know where your son
was the night Ann Lawson was killed?

13:00.246 --> 13:01.452
He was at Malcolm's.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.824
First the good news. We found your car.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.695
Oh, good. Was there anything in it?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.235
We'll get to that.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.334
And now the bad news.

13:13.426 --> 13:16.464
About your casual date with Ann Lawson,

13:17.030 --> 13:21.001
we were told it would have been
inappropriate for her to date you.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.813
Well, she did. I met her at this bar...

13:23.870 --> 13:26.680
It wasn't a date. It's about work, your work.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.978
What? What are you talking about?

13:29.075 --> 13:33.217
Your study of criminal
behavior among juveniles.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.983
Ann was helping you.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.890
She...

13:40.486 --> 13:43.490
Maybe she gave you sealed records.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.435
You didn't want to get her
in trouble so you lied to us.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.802
That was before you found out she was killed.

13:48.861 --> 13:51.603
With all your sneaking around,

13:52.765 --> 13:56.645
it's no wonder we got the wrong impression
about you and Ann. Anybody would.

14:00.773 --> 14:06.223
Especially someone with a juicy adolescent
crush on their probation officer.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.362
Oh, I get it. Paul ran her over.

14:12.785 --> 14:14.287
With his... with his skateboard?

14:14.354 --> 14:17.062
No, with your car.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.367
You see this damage?

14:21.728 --> 14:25.335
Ann's blood and hair
were found in the radiator.

14:25.565 --> 14:28.603
And then there's the rear
view mirror and the seat,

14:28.668 --> 14:32.912
which was adjusted for someone
roughly around 5'10...

14:34.574 --> 14:35.848
Paul didn't do this.

14:35.908 --> 14:37.888
I had the car, I drove it to the bar.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.421
But he knew you were meeting with her.

14:41.848 --> 14:44.488
And seeing how smitten he was over her,

14:45.585 --> 14:47.326
once he saw the two of you together,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.230
he just had to vent. He had to.

14:49.288 --> 14:53.259
He had the extra set of keys,
he took your car and Wham.

14:53.659 --> 14:54.933
Paul is not a criminal.

14:55.628 --> 14:57.539
His rap sheet says otherwise.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.076
He made one mistake.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.604
There's a big difference between one
bad judgment and a criminal mindset.

15:03.669 --> 15:06.707
Paul does not have the predisposition
for antisocial behavior.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.913
That's learned over years and
years through generations.

15:15.314 --> 15:16.691
I went out and I got my own copy.

15:16.749 --> 15:18.422
It's The Jukes Family of New York State.

15:18.484 --> 15:22.261
"The true story of a genetically-linked
clan of paupers, harlots,

15:22.822 --> 15:25.029
"misfits and petty criminals."

15:26.959 --> 15:29.667
It's inspired a whole
generation of behaviorists,

15:31.330 --> 15:33.332
and maybe it inspired you.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.737
Look, Professor,

15:37.503 --> 15:40.609
now, maybe it's just hit home
now that your son was...

15:40.673 --> 15:42.346
Paul didn't do it.

15:42.809 --> 15:43.981
I did.

15:45.678 --> 15:49.182
I was in love with Ann and I
begged her not to break it off.

15:49.248 --> 15:50.659
But she wouldn't listen.

15:50.716 --> 15:53.322
She walked away. She just walked away.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.322
And I killed her.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.304
He just took the rap for his kid.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.334
What a good Dad.

16:04.397 --> 16:08.072
What it did was it gave us an open
invitation to search his place.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.774
Make sure the warrant covers the kid's room.

16:14.240 --> 16:18.450
Other than a pair of moldy shoes in
the kid's closet, it's slim pickings.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.655
This is a family tree that Bryce
has been putting together.

16:22.715 --> 16:26.253
It's pretty rough, and it's
got his own shorthand.

16:27.520 --> 16:30.000
But there's one name here,

16:30.923 --> 16:32.231
L. Devlin.

16:33.793 --> 16:37.969
Now, there was a Devlin on the
list of Ann's open cases.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.112
Yeah. "Devlin, Lane."

16:42.468 --> 16:45.074
This docket number, it's a criminal case,

16:46.372 --> 16:48.750
but not a delinquency file.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.982
Well, this might be why.

16:53.679 --> 16:57.320
If L. Devlin is the same person,
he or she was born in 1975.

16:57.383 --> 16:59.454
One of her old probationers?

17:00.086 --> 17:01.861
Back for an encore?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.726
Aunt Trina will be claiming
her this afternoon.

17:06.791 --> 17:09.102
Dad wants the viewing tomorrow night.

17:09.161 --> 17:11.471
The last time I saw her, we fought.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.977
I shouldn't have. She didn't deserve it.

17:14.032 --> 17:15.239
Oh, now.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.569
You didn't know.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.519
Dad, he wants to know
on account she was run over.

17:21.574 --> 17:22.746
Open casket?

17:24.277 --> 17:28.349
Daddy, we need to see her to say goodbye.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.627
Listen to me, cousin.

17:37.056 --> 17:38.694
Ann was a sister.

17:39.458 --> 17:42.769
She'll have pride of place,
so everyone can see her.

17:43.095 --> 17:45.473
Now, you'll have to use your skills
on the left side of her face

17:45.531 --> 17:47.772
but you will make her pretty.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.614
Now, you can do that, can't you, cousin?

17:53.172 --> 17:55.482
MAN: Lane Devlin was
picked up for shoplifting.

17:55.541 --> 17:56.815
Her and her 12-year-old.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.753
They tag-teamed the store?

17:59.345 --> 18:00.847
It was cute.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.860
Kid's up front, spilling her
Slurpee, making a diversion,

18:03.916 --> 18:06.522
while Mom's stuffing
battery packs into her purse.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.163
The kid's got a hell of a role model.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.097
Her mom's got priors for bad checks.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.464
What we can't figure,

18:11.524 --> 18:15.233
is why her file was with a juvenile
probation officer in Manhattan.

18:15.294 --> 18:18.275
You mean Ann Lawson. She's Lane Devlin's aunt.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.340
Lane called her when she
and the kid got popped.

18:22.902 --> 18:24.575
And she came and bailed them out?

18:24.637 --> 18:26.139
Apparently, it wasn't the first time.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.616
The little girl, where did she end up?

18:27.673 --> 18:30.984
Back with her mom. Lawson told us
she was going to seek custody.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.250
Her and the mom had a real squabble about it.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.815
Lane Devlin's other relatives, uh,

18:36.315 --> 18:38.818
you wouldn't happen to have
run across any of them?

18:38.884 --> 18:42.195
We've had dealings with two of her brothers
for possession of stolen property,

18:42.254 --> 18:45.531
and she's got a cousin doing
time for a short-dollar scheme.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.600
I gotta get back in.

18:48.094 --> 18:51.871
This clan of misfits and petty
criminals Professor Bryce was studying

18:51.931 --> 18:53.239
was Ann Lawson's.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.371
Yeah, a study that he was
afraid to tell us about.

18:56.435 --> 18:59.416
Maybe one of these criminals isn't so petty.

19:04.110 --> 19:05.885
I didn't talk all that much to her,

19:05.945 --> 19:08.482
her being down in the city, busy with her job.

19:08.547 --> 19:10.288
She was in law enforcement.

19:10.349 --> 19:13.421
That must have made for some
tense moments at family dinners.

19:13.552 --> 19:16.226
She got along with everybody.
She was all for the family.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.962
EAMES: A family she never
mentioned to her co-workers.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.766
Why would she?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.431
What do you people want from me?

19:24.063 --> 19:25.633
I'd like a glass of water.

19:26.365 --> 19:27.742
Is that okay?

19:28.334 --> 19:29.972
No, no, that's okay. I can get it myself.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.982
I need to run some names by you,

19:32.038 --> 19:34.040
starting with your brother Evan.

19:35.541 --> 19:36.679
Hi.

19:38.644 --> 19:40.214
You're Fiona, right?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.387
I'm Bobby.

19:49.221 --> 19:51.462
I'm sorry about your Aunt Annie.

19:54.827 --> 19:56.272
What are you reading?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.767
A schoolbook.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.211
Atlantic County School District.
That's South New Jersey.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.912
You went to school there?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.982
Just for a semester.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.517
Bucks County, Pennsylvania.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.620
You went to school there, too?

20:20.086 --> 20:21.360
Last year.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.035
Is that why your Aunt wanted
you to move in with her,

20:31.097 --> 20:32.804
because you move around so much?

20:35.801 --> 20:38.645
Would you have liked that,
to live with your Aunt?

20:39.805 --> 20:43.014
I wouldn't have liked
living away from the family.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.581
Well, wasn't your Aunt family?

20:48.781 --> 20:50.488
She didn't live with the family.

20:50.549 --> 20:53.291
She went to live outside, with them.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.290
You mean outsiders,

20:59.558 --> 21:00.798
like me?

21:04.997 --> 21:08.001
Being an outsider is not such a hot thing.

21:09.702 --> 21:12.683
They're suckers. Outsiders are suckers.

21:17.042 --> 21:20.546
I can't imagine Ann being
killed over a custody battle.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.925
Even with her criminal record, Lane
had nothing to worry about from Ann.

21:25.718 --> 21:28.756
Unless you factor in the
family's criminal record.

21:28.821 --> 21:31.165
You see them all checking us out?

21:31.357 --> 21:32.995
I'll bet you that every one of them,

21:33.058 --> 21:36.403
either by blood or marriage,
is related to the Devlins.

21:37.029 --> 21:39.270
These RV's, campers, trailers.

21:39.965 --> 21:42.036
This is their winter camping ground.

21:42.101 --> 21:44.445
Come spring, they'll hit the road.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.415
They're Travellers.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.892
Travellers. I can't say that
I know that much about them.

21:58.951 --> 22:01.329
That's how they like it. They're insular.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.123
They have their own language, Shelta.

22:04.824 --> 22:07.828
They're like a tribe. They're
scattered across the country

22:07.893 --> 22:10.396
in family groups maintaining
a nomadic lifestyle.

22:10.462 --> 22:12.874
With the rep of being scam artists.

22:13.465 --> 22:15.809
Roof and driveway repair
fraud, that sort of thing.

22:15.868 --> 22:18.974
They also do seasonal work, anything
to support life on the road.

22:19.038 --> 22:22.679
And one of them used Professor
Bryce's car to kill her

22:23.042 --> 22:25.852
over the custody of this little girl?

22:25.911 --> 22:29.654
Well, one thing the Travellers
are not known for is violence.

22:30.549 --> 22:34.691
Well, depends on how far
Ann would go to get custody.

22:35.721 --> 22:37.166
I mean, she was telling Bryce everything.

22:37.223 --> 22:40.227
Not just names and birth dates,

22:41.026 --> 22:44.405
but financial arrangements,
their frauds, their travels,

22:44.463 --> 22:47.239
the kids' neglected education.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.211
That's a powerful piece of
evidence in a custody fight.

22:50.269 --> 22:54.376
That might be what she intended to
use it for when it was finished.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.852
But it could also link the Devlins

22:57.142 --> 23:00.817
to hundreds of crimes across the
country from here to Missouri.

23:01.280 --> 23:05.194
If someone wanted to stop
Miss Lawson from talking,

23:05.684 --> 23:09.359
can you tell who would have the
authority to order such a thing?

23:09.521 --> 23:11.467
Well, this symbol here...

23:13.492 --> 23:18.066
here, it indicates a tribute
being paid to a K. Devlin

23:18.130 --> 23:20.406
by other members of the family.

23:21.967 --> 23:24.004
It means he could be the alpha dog.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.015
Ann's older brother Kyle.

23:26.739 --> 23:29.618
Bryce likes to get up close to his subjects.

23:29.675 --> 23:33.418
He lived with this South American tribe.

23:36.382 --> 23:39.386
He would have insisted on meeting Ann's tribe.

23:42.421 --> 23:46.267
For a pair of cops investigating a
murder all the way down in the city,

23:46.325 --> 23:50.569
you're spending a lot of time bothering
the very people who loved my sister.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.109
She was a part of our family too, Mr. Devlin,

23:53.165 --> 23:55.111
her being a probation officer.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.243
If you have any ideas,

23:57.303 --> 23:59.943
like about this boyfriend
of hers, Malcolm Bryce...

24:00.472 --> 24:02.315
I don't know much about him.

24:02.841 --> 24:05.583
He drove up here with Ann. Didn't he?

24:06.645 --> 24:11.025
He charged some gas about 3 weeks…
ago, last Saturday, right?

24:11.083 --> 24:13.495
At a station about a mile from here.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.094
Yeah. Ann brought him
around for a cup of coffee.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.692
Seemed a decent sort.

24:18.757 --> 24:20.794
What did Ann tell you about him?

24:20.859 --> 24:23.772
Just a guy she fancied. High school teacher.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.607
Why do you suspect him?

24:25.764 --> 24:29.211
Well, let's just say we're
not not suspecting him.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.850
- This your truck?
- That's my son's.

24:33.906 --> 24:36.011
Yeah, it looks like there's
a little mix-up here.

24:36.075 --> 24:39.420
These packages say,
"50-year-warranty shingles."

24:39.478 --> 24:41.151
- Yeah.
- They look a little thin to me.

24:41.213 --> 24:43.090
- He's using a new amalgam.
- More like 20 years.

24:43.148 --> 24:44.889
That's a spun glass core and the like.

24:44.950 --> 24:47.726
And the like? This roofing tar?

24:47.786 --> 24:49.356
Is that new too?

24:49.421 --> 24:52.994
Because, I don't know,
it feels like crankcase oil.

24:53.058 --> 24:55.095
I'll mention that to my son.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.808
Hey, you know, it's kind of odd

25:02.267 --> 25:06.272
that you called Bryce a high school teacher.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.379
That's what he said he was.

25:08.440 --> 25:12.252
Really? Because he's a college
professor. Teaches anthropology.

25:13.545 --> 25:16.151
They study social groups. Tribes, clans.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.126
Even extended families. How tall are you?

25:18.450 --> 25:19.588
What's that to you?

25:19.651 --> 25:22.723
Don't make us look it up
on your driver's license.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.561
5'11...

25:24.623 --> 25:26.102
You're all legs.

25:26.158 --> 25:27.933
That's why you sit so low in the seat.

25:27.993 --> 25:30.371
You don't mind, do you,
getting out of my truck?

25:38.404 --> 25:40.816
You know, it might interest you to know

25:40.873 --> 25:43.285
that Malcolm Bryce wrote
a book a few years ago

25:43.342 --> 25:46.084
about a tribe of fierce warriors.

25:47.279 --> 25:49.782
He's writing a new book about a new tribe.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.058
It's no matter to me.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.598
He started drawing a family tree,

25:56.922 --> 25:59.926
and it looks like a clan of modern day nomads.

26:00.192 --> 26:05.005
You know, itinerant tradesmen,
roofers and the like.

26:07.833 --> 26:10.404
This isn't your tribe,
is it, here, you think?

26:14.139 --> 26:17.018
You know, because, look, it says KD.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.056
That could be you,

26:19.111 --> 26:22.991
and then PD, ED. That must be your sons.

26:23.949 --> 26:27.487
And then there's these little
squiggles next to the names.

26:28.053 --> 26:32.468
You know, I think that's Bryce's
shorthand for criminal records.

26:32.691 --> 26:37.606
Professor Bryce was putting you and
your kin under the microscope.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.669
You know, like bugs on a pin?

26:43.469 --> 26:47.281
Yeah, well, he should study his own tribe,

26:48.107 --> 26:49.586
with that kid,

26:49.942 --> 26:52.889
that car thief that was
panting after my sister.

26:53.112 --> 26:54.614
Where'd you hear about that?

26:55.214 --> 26:57.717
From Ann. He was trouble.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.389
And we're finished talking.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.859
Right?

27:07.459 --> 27:11.532
If I understand you, you no longer
consider Paul a murder suspect?

27:11.597 --> 27:12.701
Yes.

27:12.764 --> 27:16.007
We believe Paul was home the
night Ann Lawson was killed.

27:16.802 --> 27:20.944
But he needs to tell us about any
contact he had with her family.

27:21.507 --> 27:26.354
This call to Rockland County from your
mother's phone on a Saturday 3 weeks ago.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.991
How'd you get this number?

27:31.850 --> 27:35.491
I found it at my Dad's place,
on some driving directions.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.096
He was going somewhere with Miss Lawson?

27:41.426 --> 27:42.598
Yes.

27:46.298 --> 27:48.972
Some guy answered. He said
he was a friend of Ann's.

27:49.034 --> 27:50.172
Kyle something.

27:51.236 --> 27:54.479
He said that her and my Dad had just left.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.314
What else did you talk about?

27:57.843 --> 28:00.915
He asked me if I was one of Ann's kids.

28:01.747 --> 28:04.819
He just... he kept talking. He was funny. I...

28:04.883 --> 28:07.693
Told him all about how you feel about Ann.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.093
And about your Dad.

28:10.589 --> 28:11.761
Yeah.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.796
I think he was a little drunk.

28:14.860 --> 28:16.703
Why do you think that?

28:17.229 --> 28:19.971
They were having some party.
I heard music in the back,

28:20.032 --> 28:22.239
lots of people laughing and singing.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.072
Kyle told us it was just a cup of coffee.

28:26.638 --> 28:30.279
Might be something about that party
he doesn't want us to know about.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.252
Here's the first one.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.484
It prides me to know that we'll
be one blood from now on.

28:38.684 --> 28:40.891
It's good for everyone, cousin.

28:41.119 --> 28:43.463
(SPEAKING IN SHELTA)

28:52.531 --> 28:53.703
TED: Sheriff Mulroney's right.

28:53.765 --> 28:56.405
There must have been over
100 people at the Devlin's.

28:56.468 --> 28:57.913
Lots of Indiana plates.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.610
The Sheriff said he had his
deputies keeping an eye on things.

29:00.672 --> 29:03.516
Yeah, well, you always got to
keep an eye on the Devlins.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.852
Kyle hired you to take pictures.
It must have been a special occasion.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.654
Uh-huh. Yeah, he said it was
for a confirmation party.

29:09.715 --> 29:11.558
It was a very nice affair.

29:11.817 --> 29:12.921
Right.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.591
It was for his granddaughter, Fiona,

29:15.654 --> 29:20.228
and a friend's grandson, a kid
from Indiana, Eric Brennan.

29:20.826 --> 29:23.397
It looks over the top for a confirmation.

29:23.462 --> 29:25.339
The flowers are all wrong.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.934
Roses, rhododendrons, foxgloves.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.638
The flowers of Ireland.

29:31.403 --> 29:34.646
In the girl's hair. Ivy, faithfulness.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.243
The blue dress, the lavender bouquet.

29:38.443 --> 29:40.923
All that's traditional for an Irish bride.

29:41.913 --> 29:44.450
This was an engagement
party for these two kids.

29:46.618 --> 29:50.293
An arranged marriage. That's what
Ann wanted Malcolm to see.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.633
An arranged marriage, between children?

29:57.062 --> 29:58.905
This is just a betrothal.

29:59.131 --> 30:02.544
The actual marriage will take place
when they reach a legal age.

30:02.601 --> 30:05.775
Until then, the boy, Eric Brennan,
will live with the Devlins.

30:05.837 --> 30:09.910
The whole idea's so primitive. An
arranged marriage in this day and age.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.922
Yes, especially in light of the
stunning success people have

30:12.978 --> 30:15.891
choosing their own mates in this day and age.

30:15.947 --> 30:19.622
It doesn't matter what we think.
It's what Ann Lawson thought.

30:20.786 --> 30:24.529
She had a history of intervening
on behalf of the little girl.

30:26.558 --> 30:30.233
It might be what finally pushed her
into spilling her guts to Bryce.

30:31.330 --> 30:34.277
I don't know anything about the
Devlins. Ann never told me anything.

30:36.902 --> 30:38.381
She told you.

30:40.005 --> 30:41.416
She showed you.

30:42.407 --> 30:45.581
And then she took you
right into the heart of it.

30:46.778 --> 30:51.386
The last free-living tribe of
nomads in America. What a subject.

30:52.417 --> 30:55.193
What a book. Might even get you
back on the bestseller list.

30:55.253 --> 30:56.357
Look! Just stop!

30:56.421 --> 31:00.927
All Ann wanted to do was to save a little
girl from the life of petty crime.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.268
Come on, what'd you do?
You just kept on pressing her.

31:03.328 --> 31:05.706
Look, I swear I had no
idea they'd go that far.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.744
I wanted to understand my son.

31:07.799 --> 31:09.437
Ann started telling me about her family.

31:09.501 --> 31:11.845
I encouraged her, maybe I pushed her too far.

31:11.903 --> 31:14.281
Did you push her to take you
to this engagement party?

31:14.339 --> 31:17.149
Well, I told her there'd be no book
without firsthand observation.

31:17.209 --> 31:18.882
Did anyone threaten her?

31:18.944 --> 31:21.515
Well, she was worried about Kyle's temper.

31:21.580 --> 31:26.086
You know, she found out, you know, that he
knew and, you know, her niece told her.

31:35.160 --> 31:37.902
You got no cause taking my daughter away.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.874
I make sure she goes to school, I
make sure no one is harming her.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.173
I am a good mother.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.545
This is what they're worried about.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.678
That's a good-looking
son-in-law you'll have there.

31:52.878 --> 31:54.755
I know what you think.

31:55.847 --> 31:59.420
Nothing indecent goes on.
This is just a promise.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.299
Anybody even ask Fiona if
is this is what she wanted?

32:04.456 --> 32:06.026
Fiona's a child.

32:06.591 --> 32:10.004
It's up to her elders to decide
what's best for her for her future.

32:10.061 --> 32:13.008
Well, maybe she had some little dream

32:14.299 --> 32:16.506
about what her future might be.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.613
Something that she talked
to your Aunt Annie about.

32:21.006 --> 32:22.576
This is our tradition.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.812
It's served us well. There's
no reason to change it.

32:25.877 --> 32:27.686
How'd it do for you?

32:28.213 --> 32:31.319
The husband your Dad chose
for you, where is he?

32:32.751 --> 32:34.424
He's in prison, isn't he?

32:35.086 --> 32:36.827
Five-to-ten for burglary?

32:38.590 --> 32:41.366
This kid from Indiana,
how'd your Dad pick him?

32:41.893 --> 32:43.702
He just pull his name out of a hat?

32:45.464 --> 32:47.444
He does what's best.

32:47.499 --> 32:51.345
Hey, Kyle found out who Professor Bryce was.

32:51.403 --> 32:53.144
He found out that Ann was talking to him.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.785
Dad would not harm his own sister.

32:58.076 --> 32:59.453
She was family.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.992
Even in death I heard him
making the arrangements.

33:05.050 --> 33:07.257
He wanted her to be beautiful.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.865
He wanted her to have pride of place.

33:10.856 --> 33:12.767
He wanted her to be beautiful.

33:13.892 --> 33:15.371
What did he say exactly?

33:17.896 --> 33:19.967
The left side of her face.

33:20.098 --> 33:23.307
He told them to use their
skills to make her pretty.

33:27.839 --> 33:29.841
There was a police report filed last summer

33:29.908 --> 33:31.683
with the Indiana State Troopers

33:31.743 --> 33:34.019
by Eric's grandfather, Colin Brennan.

33:34.079 --> 33:38.357
Mr. Brennan reported the theft of 7
RV's owned by the Brennan family.

33:38.416 --> 33:40.828
When the police recovered the
vehicles 3 months later,

33:40.886 --> 33:43.162
they traced them back to Kyle Devlin.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.757
Mr. Devlin stole them?

33:44.823 --> 33:47.201
The state cops never had a chance to find out.

33:47.259 --> 33:51.230
Brennan dropped his complaint. He
said it was all a misunderstanding.

33:51.296 --> 33:53.708
To be settled amongst themselves?

33:53.765 --> 33:54.869
No, it's not that simple.

33:54.933 --> 33:56.378
The outside world is fair game,

33:56.434 --> 33:57.936
but not the family.

33:58.370 --> 34:00.316
Devlin wouldn't want anyone
in the family to know

34:00.372 --> 34:02.249
that he stole from a fellow Traveller.

34:02.307 --> 34:05.447
Ah, I see. Restitution would
have to be done quietly.

34:05.544 --> 34:09.253
$200,000 doesn't change hands
without the family noticing.

34:09.313 --> 34:10.793
He'd have to disguise it.

34:10.849 --> 34:14.295
Yeah. It's tradition
for the family of the bride

34:14.351 --> 34:16.831
to pay a dowry to the family of the groom.

34:18.188 --> 34:20.396
Devlin arranged this marriage

34:20.458 --> 34:23.563
and used his granddaughter
to cover up his crime.

34:24.129 --> 34:26.871
If they were confronted
with what Devlin did...

34:26.931 --> 34:29.572
Why would they believe us? We're outsiders.

34:31.168 --> 34:32.944
But they'd believe Ann.

34:33.638 --> 34:35.549
You said there's no evidence she knew.

34:37.208 --> 34:40.417
Well, maybe Professor Bryce
misplaced some of his notes.

34:44.616 --> 34:47.755
First of all, I want to say
thank you to Colin Brennan

34:47.819 --> 34:50.857
for entrusting young Eric to our care.

34:51.656 --> 34:53.465
ALL: Here, here.

34:53.525 --> 34:55.163
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

34:55.726 --> 34:58.731
Now just one more word, if I may,

34:58.797 --> 35:02.939
about our sister, Annie Devlin.

35:03.001 --> 35:05.538
She didn't always agree with our way,

35:05.870 --> 35:07.907
but her love was always true.

35:07.973 --> 35:10.180
You're back in our arms, Annie,

35:10.875 --> 35:12.650
never to leave again.

35:12.844 --> 35:14.755
Here, here.

35:14.813 --> 35:16.724
And one final wish here.

35:19.517 --> 35:24.466
That the man who killed her be met
with justice, merciful and swift.

35:24.889 --> 35:26.766
This is a private function.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.732
Yes. We're sorry about that.

35:32.430 --> 35:35.502
But we have some news that we
need to share with your family.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.012
We took your advice

35:37.068 --> 35:39.639
and took a closer look at Malcolm Bryce.

35:40.038 --> 35:42.917
We arrested him for the murder of your sister.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.751
Well, that is good news. And I appreciate
your coming down here to tell us.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.087
There are just a few loose ends to tie up.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.559
We never got a formal ID by the family.

35:51.616 --> 35:54.722
There's a picture for you to look
at and then a form for you to sign.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.198
This might not be a good idea
for your daughter to see.

35:57.255 --> 36:00.828
You saw her after the mortician
did his work, isn't that right?

36:00.892 --> 36:03.168
You had no idea it was this bad.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.998
No, I didn't. But that's her.

36:06.364 --> 36:08.275
GOREN: It's pretty shocking

36:08.867 --> 36:11.143
if you see it for the first time.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.680
Especially what happened to the...

36:14.205 --> 36:16.116
to the left side of her face.

36:17.776 --> 36:18.880
Thanks.

36:18.943 --> 36:24.484
Last thing. We need some help
deciphering some notations

36:24.883 --> 36:29.957
that we found on these
papers in Bryce's office.

36:30.388 --> 36:33.733
You remember he was writing
a book about your family?

36:33.825 --> 36:37.136
Well, it looks like your sister was helping.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.672
It might even be the reason why he killed her.

36:40.398 --> 36:42.844
Anybody can snoop through county records,

36:42.901 --> 36:44.505
make up stories.

36:44.569 --> 36:47.982
The Devlins don't go talking
family business with outsiders.

36:48.039 --> 36:49.643
I should hope not.

36:51.609 --> 36:54.920
Well, maybe he made it up. Let's see.

36:55.513 --> 36:58.756
It concerns someone named Aidan. Is he here?

36:59.017 --> 37:00.655
I'm Aidan Devlin.

37:01.886 --> 37:04.765
And next to your name, there's a notation.

37:04.823 --> 37:06.962
It says, "sine prole."

37:07.992 --> 37:10.131
Now, that's Latin.

37:10.595 --> 37:12.939
It means you have no children. Is that right?

37:13.431 --> 37:14.637
It is.

37:14.699 --> 37:19.011
Next to it is a symbol.
I think it means an injury.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.681
You have no children
because of an injury.

37:23.074 --> 37:25.076
Annie was a good girl and all,

37:25.577 --> 37:28.456
but she shouldn't have been
gossiping to strangers.

37:29.447 --> 37:30.824
It isn't right.

37:33.885 --> 37:37.230
Well, at least, we know now
that Bryce wasn't making it up.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.368
What about this? It's next to your name.

37:41.693 --> 37:44.936
It says, "debere." That's more Latin.

37:45.563 --> 37:48.339
It means a debt.

37:48.633 --> 37:52.479
Next to it, there are
initials, “CB.” who's that?

37:52.537 --> 37:55.245
That would be me. I'm Colin Brennan.

37:55.306 --> 37:56.478
Oh.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.587
And this debt?

38:00.979 --> 38:04.119
It's a dowry. It's nothing to worry about.

38:05.884 --> 38:09.798
Actually, anthropologists, they
have a special symbol for dowry.

38:10.688 --> 38:13.931
Bryce would have used it.
So no, this is definitely a debt.

38:14.259 --> 38:18.571
Underneath it there's another
notation. It's the number 7.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.070
And it's got this little
circle thing next to it.

38:22.133 --> 38:25.342
Bryce used this symbol in his other book.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.009
It meant that...

38:29.174 --> 38:31.882
A pig was stolen from a member of the tribe.

38:32.911 --> 38:36.757
Which just means that the debt
is about 7 stolen pigs.

38:38.850 --> 38:41.160
You're not a pig farmer are you, Mr. Brennan?

38:41.219 --> 38:42.960
No, I ain't.

38:43.021 --> 38:45.228
I sell recreational vehicles.

38:46.491 --> 38:50.268
So, maybe the debt is about 7 stolen RV's?

38:51.229 --> 38:54.836
Is that why he owes you money,
because he stole 7 RV's from you?

38:54.899 --> 38:57.072
I told you, it's a dowry.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.040
Yes, you did. What about it, Mr. Brennan?

39:01.172 --> 39:03.243
Your cousin here steal from you?

39:03.308 --> 39:04.582
He did.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.016
Well, how much does he owe you?

39:07.345 --> 39:10.224
$220,000.

39:10.548 --> 39:14.792
I'm guessing it's as much as the
dowry for your grandson's wedding?

39:15.386 --> 39:18.833
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.028
Colin, listen...

39:20.091 --> 39:24.164
I only agreed to help you save
your honor before your family.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.732
But your family can't
keep their mouths shut.

39:28.333 --> 39:31.246
Come on, Eric. The marriage is over.

39:33.304 --> 39:37.047
The Devlins won't be welcome
in our parts anymore.

39:37.976 --> 39:40.650
And you still owe us the money.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.116
I should have known.

39:44.782 --> 39:46.523
I should have known it!

39:46.584 --> 39:48.825
You can't trust those Brennans!

39:48.887 --> 39:51.197
This is all a misunderstanding.

39:53.157 --> 39:56.934
I'm sorry, Lane. I never
wanted this to happen.

39:57.495 --> 39:59.441
But Ann wanted it.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.538
To stop the marriage.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.278
Haven't you caused enough hurt?

40:06.337 --> 40:07.816
No, haven't you?

40:08.473 --> 40:12.478
When you discovered
that Ann was telling Bryce

40:12.543 --> 40:15.285
the history of the Devlin family,

40:15.346 --> 40:19.886
or maybe I should say the
terrible misdeeds of Kyle Devlin.

40:20.184 --> 40:23.495
That she was going to throw
a wrench into your deception,

40:23.888 --> 40:28.337
stop you from marrying off your
granddaughter to hide your thievery.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.403
Don't listen to this cop.

40:31.329 --> 40:33.400
No, you're right. He's right.

40:33.798 --> 40:35.539
Don't listen to me.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.274
Listen to Ann,

40:41.472 --> 40:44.180
who only ever tried to help her beloveds.

40:45.610 --> 40:49.251
Tried to keep them out of
trouble, keep them in school,

40:50.315 --> 40:52.693
help them to have a good future.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.027
Ann, who got in his way.

40:59.190 --> 41:03.605
Ann, who you disposed of as casually as you
disposed of your granddaughter's future.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.106
This is nonsense.

41:05.163 --> 41:10.340
You said that you never saw
the injuries to Ann's face.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.707
But before the family could claim the body,

41:13.771 --> 41:17.378
you described those
injuries to the mortician,

41:17.442 --> 41:21.117
telling him to use his skill
to make her pretty.

41:22.914 --> 41:24.257
That is not true.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.919
Yes, it is. It's true.

41:27.118 --> 41:28.563
I heard it.

41:30.188 --> 41:32.225
I was told about her injuries.

41:32.290 --> 41:35.533
No, you saw her when you ran her down.

41:37.395 --> 41:40.137
It wasn't me. I didn't do it!

41:40.198 --> 41:43.338
You weren't there that night,
Kyle, the night Ann died.

41:43.401 --> 41:46.109
I came by with your supper. You weren't there.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.172
You stop these hysterics.

41:48.406 --> 41:50.079
I didn't kill Annie.

41:50.141 --> 41:52.849
But she is the one who turned her back on us!

41:52.910 --> 41:55.948
The car that killed Annie wouldn't
happen to be a Buick, would it?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.853
Yes, it was.

41:58.583 --> 42:02.429
Kyle, you old car thief, that set of
master keys you borrowed from me.

42:02.487 --> 42:04.023
Am I ever getting them back?

42:05.523 --> 42:09.335
Is that it? That's it? That's the loyalty?

42:09.394 --> 42:11.340
Huh? You side with them?

42:12.130 --> 42:16.078
You side with the bitch that brought
people in here to spy on us!

42:16.367 --> 42:19.007
To kill the life, our life!

42:19.370 --> 42:21.372
It was you or her.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.078
Your ways or hers.

42:25.977 --> 42:28.457
It was self-defense. My beloveds...

42:28.513 --> 42:30.288
Shut your yap, Kyle!

42:31.349 --> 42:33.522
Take him. Get him away from here.

42:33.584 --> 42:37.896
Our pleasure. Kyle Devlin,
you're under arrest for murder.

42:38.256 --> 42:41.169
Come on now, you're not going to stand
there and let them do this to me?

42:41.225 --> 42:43.262
Paddy! Joseph! Save me!

42:43.761 --> 42:46.367
(KYLE SPEAKING IN SHELTA)

42:47.632 --> 42:51.045
Maeve, for God's sakes, I'm your brother!

42:51.936 --> 42:54.610
Lane, be a girl! Help your father!

42:56.040 --> 42:59.044
Bronson, save me. Maeve! Hey!

42:59.110 --> 43:00.646
You know, I just realized something.

43:00.711 --> 43:01.951
What's that?

43:03.581 --> 43:05.390
All that Ann gave up?

43:07.385 --> 43:09.524
It must have been hard for her.
