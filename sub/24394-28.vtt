And Anupama Verma,
the former face
of Fair & Lovely.

23:57.458 --> 24:01.166
Now what is happening,
actually, is in the country,

24:01.250 --> 24:06.667
uh, psychologically,
is that, maybe it's
Anglo of the British Raj.

24:06.750 --> 24:10.542
But generally,
a fair complexion
is looked up upon.

24:10.625 --> 24:14.750
But the dark complexion
is not so looked upon.
So especially for marriage.

24:14.834 --> 24:17.250
Toboni:
What was sort of
your standard storyline

24:17.333 --> 24:18.834
for these advertisements?

24:18.917 --> 24:21.125
Surendranath:
An arranged marriage
is being fixed.

24:21.208 --> 24:25.333
The boy comes to see the girl,
maybe finds her too dark.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.542
The next time, she's used
Fair & Lovely,

24:27.625 --> 24:30.375
another boy comes
to see the girl,
and marries her.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.083
It's a prerequisite
to get married.
(laughs)

24:33.166 --> 24:36.291
The scripts used
to be standard,
and very weird.

24:36.375 --> 24:40.166
Like, it was always about,
you can't get a job
unless you're fair.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.458
You can't get married
unless you're fair.

24:42.542 --> 24:44.959
As a model, I was cast
because I was fair,

24:45.041 --> 24:46.917
not because I was really
using the product.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.667
The Indians, they feel
fair and beautiful.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.500
Everyone is so beautiful.

24:51.583 --> 24:53.542
If you see the
matrimonial ads,
it'll always--

24:53.625 --> 24:56.667
It won't say, "Beautiful,
educated girl."
It will always say,

24:56.750 --> 24:59.583
"Wanted: Fair,
intelligent girl."

24:59.667 --> 25:04.417
In fact, you know,
a lot of people
give this for the dowry.

25:04.500 --> 25:07.041
They give her saris,
they give her, uh,

25:07.125 --> 25:10.417
you know, whatever jewelry
and stuff that she's gonna
take with her,

25:10.500 --> 25:12.041
and the fairness cream.

25:12.125 --> 25:15.000
Was there a moment
when you both felt like,

25:15.083 --> 25:17.291
maybe I should stop
endorsing this stuff.

25:17.375 --> 25:19.166
Well, when I did feel
that way, I stopped.

25:19.250 --> 25:21.750
I decided not to sell
stupid scripts, you know,

25:21.834 --> 25:25.000
which promise
the world to you
because you're fair.

25:25.083 --> 25:27.792
That's just,
I think that's
in Indian, like,

25:27.875 --> 25:30.458
you know, like a hangover
over the West is,

25:30.542 --> 25:32.583
because they feel
fair and beautiful.

25:32.667 --> 25:34.333
Fair, they think
that's beautiful.

25:34.417 --> 25:37.417
Toboni:
Having to fit into a
cultural definition of beauty

25:37.500 --> 25:40.166
to be a movie star is not
an unfamiliar concept.

25:40.250 --> 25:42.083
Hollywood basically
invented it.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.834
But skin color bias permeates
all layers of society here.

25:45.917 --> 25:50.000
And it's causing some women
to go to extreme lengths
to become lighter.

25:57.959 --> 25:59.625
(clicking)

26:00.959 --> 26:03.125
Is that smell
her skin burning?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.458
(Shah speaking)

26:23.125 --> 26:24.875
Toboni:
So it basically destroys
that pigment.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.750
Shah:
It destroys the pigment
temporarily.

26:26.834 --> 26:29.250
How popular has this
treatment been?

26:29.333 --> 26:31.083
From last year, there's
a 100 percent increase

26:31.166 --> 26:34.125
in the number of people
who are coming in
for this treatment.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.875
Wow. You've seen
100 perfect growth

26:35.959 --> 26:37.250
in this part
of your business.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.792
Yes, yes.
In this part
of the business.

26:38.875 --> 26:41.834
And Neha,
how did you decide
to get this treatment?

26:42.333 --> 26:44.834
(speaking foreign language)

26:56.750 --> 26:58.375
Toboni:
You know, if you're
applying to a job,

26:58.458 --> 27:01.208
will an employer say,
"I'm sorry,
you're too dark?"

27:12.041 --> 27:14.458
Do you feel a sense of guilt
for, in some ways,

27:14.542 --> 27:16.041
perpetuating
that narrative?

27:16.125 --> 27:19.625
Yeah. You feel that
it's not the right thing
which you're doing,

27:19.709 --> 27:21.792
Because she is
beautiful as is.

27:21.875 --> 27:23.834
I'm not helping her
getting a job,

27:23.917 --> 27:26.125
but that is what
the industry demands.

27:26.208 --> 27:28.458
Toboni:
Celebrities endorsing
these products,

27:28.542 --> 27:31.542
commercials broadcasted
to hundreds of
millions of people,

27:31.625 --> 27:36.750
contributes to an already
deeply rooted prejudice
that goes back generations.

27:36.834 --> 27:39.959
Kavitha Emannuel
has been working
to change this for years

27:40.041 --> 27:42.667
with a campaign called,
"Dark Is Beautiful."

27:42.750 --> 27:47.583
This is a belief that is
embedded deep in our minds.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.333
It is part of our culture.

27:49.417 --> 27:51.041
Where did this
all begin?

27:51.125 --> 27:55.417
I think there are several
reasons as to why we have
this issue today.

27:55.500 --> 27:58.208
And people,
especially here in India,

27:58.291 --> 28:01.375
people always ask me,
"Is it because of
colonialism?"

28:01.458 --> 28:03.959
And then there is
the caste issue,
of course we have.

28:04.041 --> 28:09.291
And the general belief
is that the higher up
you are in the caste system,

28:09.375 --> 28:10.917
you are lighter.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.667
The whole idea of,
the ruler was white.

28:14.750 --> 28:18.667
Is this just, sort of,
in certain parts of society,
every now and then,

28:18.750 --> 28:20.875
or is this something that
people face every day?

28:20.959 --> 28:24.083
There are things
that we do
at home every day,

28:24.166 --> 28:27.583
that tell you that
we are biased
when it comes to skin color.

28:27.667 --> 28:31.250
When a baby is born in India,
the first thing, of course,

28:31.333 --> 28:33.625
people want to know
if it's girl or a boy.

28:33.709 --> 28:36.917
But then the next thing
people look for
is the color of the skin.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.375
-Just when the baby is born?
-Just when the baby is born.

28:39.458 --> 28:44.875
From day one, parents start
speaking negative stuff
about the baby's skin.

28:44.959 --> 28:47.333
Just imagine
how the child grows up.

28:47.417 --> 28:52.041
I saw how it affected
the confidence level,
um, in girls.

28:52.125 --> 28:54.083
That really
kind of shocked me.

28:54.166 --> 28:58.458
I thought, "Wow, this is
a big issue, and no one's
talking about it."

28:59.458 --> 29:00.875
Toboni:
Campaigns like Emmanuel's

29:00.959 --> 29:04.041
have helped to spur others
to join in and speak out.

29:04.125 --> 29:07.041
A youth group called Kranti
is helping young girls

29:07.125 --> 29:09.959
reclaim their self-esteem.

29:10.041 --> 29:11.542
-I love my skin.
-It's brown.

29:11.625 --> 29:12.917
-Dark brown.
-Orange-ish.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.667
-My mom gave me this skin.
-And I'm proud of it.

29:15.750 --> 29:19.083
Kranti operates as a home
for daughters of sex workers,

29:19.166 --> 29:23.875
and their mission is to empowr
their girls to combat class
and skin color discrimination.

29:24.834 --> 29:26.875
(girl speaking)

29:46.166 --> 29:49.333
How many of you
have used a
skin-lightening cream?

29:54.166 --> 29:56.500
(girl speaking)

30:21.375 --> 30:23.417
Emmanuel:
It's out there every day,
in your face,

30:23.500 --> 30:25.792
it's shown on the television,
every other product

30:25.875 --> 30:27.959
is talking about
whitening your skin,

30:28.041 --> 30:30.208
and we've seen
how it affects children.

30:30.291 --> 30:34.750
We are a diverse nation
with diverse languages
and ethnicities.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.834
I think we should
look forward and see,

30:36.917 --> 30:40.500
why are we still
entertaining this
toxic belief?
