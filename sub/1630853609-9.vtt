WEBVTT

00:49.967 --> 00:55.430
Okay. So, these go in Mary-Kate's mouth,
and these go in Ashley's butt.

00:55.931 --> 00:59.393
If you get this wrong, Marisol,
they'll both die.

01:18.871 --> 01:19.872
David Chang,

01:19.955 --> 01:23.458
the quality of your work has really been
declining in the last six months.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.543
I'm sorry.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.963
I'm opening a restaurant in Macau tonight,
and I'm pretty overwhelmed.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.341
Does that sound like a me problem
or a you problem?

01:31.425 --> 01:33.302
You're right. I'll start over again.

01:33.385 --> 01:34.428
That's what I thought.

01:49.985 --> 01:52.613
Good morning, Nicholas.
When did you get in?

01:53.197 --> 01:54.281
Just a couple minutes ago.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.783
I found you some Japanese flame lilies.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.620
They're Asian, beautiful
and a little bit toxic.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.079
Just like me.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.373
Cute. That's so thoughtful.

02:04.541 --> 02:07.878
Wow. Look at this beautiful blue number.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.006
Yeah. I thought
a little Alexander McQueen for my queen.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.759
This will be perfect
for your big premiere tonight.

02:13.842 --> 02:15.844
Oh, my God.
It doesn't even count as a premiere.

02:15.928 --> 02:20.474
It's a tiny part in a tiny play
in a tiny theater in North Hollywood.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.893
North Hollywood?
Didn't that all burn down in the '70s?

02:22.976 --> 02:25.646
Yeah, that's what I thought too.
But apparently, it's still there.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.857
Well, I will go to this
alleged North Hollywood

02:28.941 --> 02:31.318
just to see you in Cahoga Lake.

02:32.194 --> 02:34.738
What a great name for a play.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.991
I hope they say the title in the dialogue.
I love it when that happens.

02:38.075 --> 02:39.785
I won't spoil if we do or not.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.996
And I am bringing
a giant bottle of champagne

02:43.080 --> 02:44.081
for us to get drunk on after.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.583
Oh, my God.
The 2007 Louis Roederer Cristal?

02:47.584 --> 02:49.169
-2006.
-No--

02:49.253 --> 02:51.880
No. You're saving that
for when Brad and Jennifer

02:51.964 --> 02:53.966
finally come to their senses
and get back together.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.175
We can't.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.012
This is more important than that.

03:46.476 --> 03:50.564
Good morning, everyone. Big day today.
I have a huge surprise!

03:51.064 --> 03:53.984
As a child of divorce,
I do not like surprises.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.777
I can't switch schools again.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.571
This is a good surprise, Howard.
A really good one.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.742
The board of supervisors
are voting on our zoning proposal.

04:06.872 --> 04:09.124
Okay. I mean,
when are you gonna get to the surprise?

04:09.208 --> 04:12.878
But that is the surprise.
They're going to vote yes!

04:12.961 --> 04:15.506
The Alameda Street housing project
is officially a go!

04:16.923 --> 04:17.966
Wow! That's great.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.677
And actually,
they want us to come to the vote

04:20.761 --> 04:22.053
to celebrate our hard work.

04:22.137 --> 04:23.931
-Oh, my God. So like a party?
-Kind of.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.226
There won't be food or drinks
or any talking allowed.

04:27.309 --> 04:29.436
But they will clap for a few seconds.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.814
Well, that's amazing, Sofia.
Congratulations.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.858
-Right? To you.
-Yeah.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.944
-And to all of us.
-Yeah.

04:37.027 --> 04:40.864
And believe it or not,
I actually have a surprise too.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.116
Jean-Pierre, come on in!

04:43.200 --> 04:44.451
Hey.

04:45.035 --> 04:46.245
I was hiding in a kitchen.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.706
It's funny what American think
croissants taste like.

04:49.790 --> 04:50.791
Not even close.

04:51.708 --> 04:56.713
I asked Jean-Pierre here today to help me
make a very special announcement.

04:59.591 --> 05:03.303
Poverty. Famine. Climate change.

05:03.804 --> 05:06.223
The world's problems continue to mount.

05:06.723 --> 05:11.728
But as human beings, our greatest strength
is our ability to cooperate.

05:12.229 --> 05:14.815
Our greatest asset is each other.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
At the Silver Moon Summit,
located in Corsica, France,

05:18.402 --> 05:22.114
the world's foremost leaders in business,
politics, and thought

05:22.197 --> 05:27.160
will convene to mobilize new policies
and challenge old assumptions.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.581
Together, we can overcome any obstacle.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.417
Together, we can change the world.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.254
Shit! We made the Silver Moon Summit?

05:37.337 --> 05:41.216
Last year they had Rihanna
do a duet with hologram John Lennon.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.385
We are all going, guys.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.555
All-expenses-paid.
It's going to be amazing.

05:46.638 --> 05:48.557
It's on the same day as my wedding.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.350
That's okay. I can push it.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.227
It's only 600 people.

05:52.311 --> 05:56.481
Plus, Jean-Pierre and I will be presenting
something super special there this year.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.026
I haven't told you guys about it yet.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.238
It's called
the Arroyo water filtration machine.

06:03.322 --> 06:04.489
Don't ask me how it works.

06:04.573 --> 06:07.409
But Jean-Pierre and his science nerds
are really excited about it.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.829
Basically, it takes dirty water
and makes it safe to drink.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.457
We can make a huge difference.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.668
I love how you say "difference."

06:16.752 --> 06:18.253
Okay. Thank you, Howard.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.256
That's good too. Say my name again.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.258
Howard.

06:27.262 --> 06:30.599
…And, I mean-- Yeah. No, no.
That's an incredible opportunity.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.226
I would love to.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.103
No. No. Thank you.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.773
Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you soon.

06:42.778 --> 06:45.030
So, who was that on the phone?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.241
Are we talking now?
I thought we were fighting.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.785
We are fighting. Forget it.
I don't even wanna know. Don't tell me.

06:49.868 --> 06:53.288
I'm gonna tell you because you don't wanna
know. That was the director of the play.

06:53.372 --> 06:58.168
The actor who plays Dylan is dropping out
because he got a role on Young Sheldon.

06:58.252 --> 06:59.378
Young Sheldon?

06:59.461 --> 07:01.797
I mean, comedy, drama,
that show has it all.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.132
And now they want me to play Dylan.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.134
But Dylan's the lead.

07:07.052 --> 07:08.470
I mean, that's huge.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.514
That's potentially life-changing!

07:12.307 --> 07:13.392
Not that I care.

07:15.185 --> 07:16.353
Good luck.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.437
With nothing.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.613
Hey. I just wanted to touch base.

07:27.447 --> 07:30.242
Those were some pretty big bombs
you dropped this morning.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.870
Corsica. Some magic water machine.

07:32.953 --> 07:35.581
And your clapping surprise,
which was also cool.

07:35.664 --> 07:37.082
But we don't need to compare them.

07:37.165 --> 07:40.002
Well, I just wish we would've talked
about this beforehand.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.253
We're supposed to be partners.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.172
Well, Jean-Pierre
wanted to keep it hush-hush.

07:43.255 --> 07:45.757
-Jean-Pierre.
-I know secrets can be bad.

07:45.841 --> 07:48.552
But they are kind of sexy sometimes,
don't you think?

07:48.635 --> 07:50.512
I don't love the idea of a conference

07:50.596 --> 07:53.849
where ten billionaires get into a room
to decide how the world should be fixed.

07:53.932 --> 07:58.020
Well, nine. Elon can't make it.
He fell off his skateboard.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.939
You know our mission. Stay local.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.942
Give money to people in the communities
who are doing the work.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.945
And we'll keep doing that.
But we can also think bigger.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.991
We can do it all. There's nothing wrong
with increasing our ambition.

08:12.242 --> 08:13.452
Okay.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.538
If you believe in this,
let's see how it goes.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.416
Great.
Then I am going to head out for the day.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.584
I will see you tomorrow.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.920
We have a zoning meeting.
We have my surprise.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.964
Yes, of course. Sitting down and waiting.

08:26.673 --> 08:27.883
Both equally great.

08:28.467 --> 08:29.468
Hooray!

08:34.640 --> 08:35.682
I forgot.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.101
Are you listening to me?

08:38.184 --> 08:39.645
Yes, of course I'm listening.

08:39.727 --> 08:41.438
I need you to go to the Rite Aid
in Van Nuys.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.148
That's where they have
the frozen shrimp I like.

08:43.232 --> 08:44.775
And don't be wandering down
the candy aisle.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.568
Yeah, baby, Van Nuys. I'm on it.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.738
Then I need you to go to the airport
to pick up my cousin in Orange County.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.949
Then come back here,
cook us dinner, take the trash out--

08:52.032 --> 08:54.952
Hey, baby, will you hold on for a second?
There's some type of IT emergency.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.080
What? Someone hacked the database?

08:58.163 --> 09:01.542
It's probably China again.
Look, I have to call you back, okay?

09:04.837 --> 09:08.715
Listen, I'd love to be a bitch to you now,
but I'm sort of dealing with something.

09:08.799 --> 09:10.259
No. I didn't come here to fight.

09:10.342 --> 09:12.386
It's just,
I already bought a ticket to the play,

09:12.469 --> 09:14.555
so I need to know if it's worth the $8.

09:14.638 --> 09:16.181
So, what's going on?

09:16.265 --> 09:18.225
I don't know. This part is really intense.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.393
There's so many lines.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.312
And then there's all this physical stuff
when I'm sanding a canoe.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.773
I know you can sand.
You got the shoulders for it.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.441
The real problem is,

09:26.525 --> 09:29.111
is that Dylan cries
at the end of the play,

09:29.194 --> 09:30.696
and I can't cry on cue.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.282
I've been trying my whole life.
I've never been able to make it happen.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.616
Which is really confusing

09:34.700 --> 09:37.661
because I can be dishonest
in literally every single other way.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.290
I mean, well, that's okay.
We can work on it together.

09:41.373 --> 09:45.002
No, it's fine. I'm just gonna tell them
to find somebody else for the part.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.837
No. I'm not gonna let you do that.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.089
Vegeta and Goku.

09:50.132 --> 09:51.258
One last ride.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.427
Then we're back to being mortal enemies.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.682
Okay. Where do we start?

09:58.765 --> 10:02.519
By asking Sharon if we can reserve this
conference room for the rest of the day.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.690
God willing, she'll say yes.

10:14.323 --> 10:18.493
Rezoning measure 14B passes 6-3.

10:18.577 --> 10:21.663
The Alameda Street housing
initiative can move forward.

10:21.747 --> 10:25.334
A special thanks to Molly Wells
and her team for all of their hard work.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.880
We look forward
to breaking ground in 2026.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.132
Really? 2026?

10:32.216 --> 10:34.718
Yeah. It used to be 2028,
but we sped it up.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.679
Okay. Now we'll open the floor
to public comments.

10:40.933 --> 10:44.102
Hi. I have a question for Ms. Wells.

10:44.186 --> 10:45.812
Yes, of course. Ask me anything.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.899
Why do you decide
what happens to our neighborhood?

10:49.441 --> 10:51.193
Is it because you have more money?

10:52.319 --> 10:56.573
Why don't you tear down one of those
mansions and build the housing there?

10:57.366 --> 10:59.368
This is disgusting.

11:00.160 --> 11:01.453
And so are you.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.540
Thank you for your time.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.921
-That was more than one question.
-Hey, don't worry about her.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.423
Yeah. There's always
a negative Nancy in the bunch.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.636
I also think Ms. Wells is disgusting.
Here's a list of reasons why.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.304
What?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.014
You are decreasing the value of our homes.

11:21.098 --> 11:24.351
Have you even considered the
environmental impacts of this high-rise?

11:24.434 --> 11:28.355
You call this housing affordable?
You don't even know what that word means.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.275
You don't have a response to any of this?

11:31.358 --> 11:33.193
You are ruining Los Angeles.

11:33.277 --> 11:34.945
This lady is the reason I'm bald.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.071
You fascist!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.074
Look at her over there,
looking down at us.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.869
I see why your husband left you.

11:41.952 --> 11:44.162
Okay, you can cut the shit right there.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.415
I am trying to help you pieces of--

11:47.124 --> 11:48.500
Molly. Just…

11:50.335 --> 11:51.920
Pieces of Los Angeles.

11:54.298 --> 11:59.136
Beautiful pieces of beautiful Los Angeles.
Our home.

12:00.095 --> 12:05.392
Home of beaches and Hollywood.

12:05.976 --> 12:10.314
Filled with sunshine and rockin' tunes…

12:10.397 --> 12:11.690
on the radio.

12:13.984 --> 12:15.444
-Is that enough?
-I think so. I--

12:16.028 --> 12:17.070
Bye.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.076
All right.

12:23.160 --> 12:25.996
Well, that concludes the public comments.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.583
And now we'll be presenting
the key to the city

12:29.666 --> 12:32.294
to YouTube sensation JoJo Siwa.

12:40.802 --> 12:43.347
His owner's dead,
but little Buster won't leave him.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.016
Not now, not ever.

12:46.892 --> 12:48.519
Man, we do not deserve dogs.

12:48.602 --> 12:51.438
We know you miss her, honey.
That's a good girl. Come on.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.106
How are you not crying right now?

12:53.690 --> 12:56.401
Sorry. I'm not really a dog person.

12:56.485 --> 12:59.696
If you're gonna lick your own butt,
you should be on a lot of drugs.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.990
Okay. Well, what about this?

13:05.369 --> 13:07.496
She's hearing for the first time.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.165
Nothing?

13:10.249 --> 13:12.668
Yeah, no. I don't really like kids.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.753
They all remind me of my niece.

13:14.837 --> 13:16.088
What a bitch.

13:16.755 --> 13:22.594
Okay. Well, here's a soldier just back
from Afghanistan surprising his family.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.058
Oh, my God.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.520
I know, I know, I know…

13:31.603 --> 13:33.146
I think I've hooked up with him.

13:34.648 --> 13:35.774
Yeah. Oh, my God.

13:35.858 --> 13:39.152
I thought he ghosted me,
but he went to Afghanistan?

13:39.862 --> 13:40.904
Lame.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.991
Can we watch something else?

13:44.908 --> 13:48.453
Okay. What the fuck was that?
I mean, I don't expect a parade,

13:48.537 --> 13:51.415
but I would also prefer not be called
a "money-shitting ass-witch."

13:51.498 --> 13:53.750
Was that a pun off the word "sandwich"?
Doesn't matter.

13:53.834 --> 13:55.002
Okay. That was a little rough,

13:55.085 --> 13:57.462
but we know this isn't a job
where you're going to get thanks.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.090
I'm not asking for thanks.
I would just like not to be attacked.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.759
Well, this isn't about you.
This is about the people you're helping.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.136
Everyone has their own struggle.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.221
I know. I know.
Everyone has their own struggle.

14:06.305 --> 14:08.265
I just wish my struggle
were a little bit easier.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.017
Eat shit, billionaire!

14:10.100 --> 14:11.018
Hey, hey, hey!

14:11.101 --> 14:13.770
-Eat shit!
-My sweater!

14:14.438 --> 14:16.690
-Sir!
-You okay? Are you okay?

14:18.150 --> 14:19.026
Sir. Sir!

14:19.109 --> 14:20.277
What the fuck!

14:30.037 --> 14:32.372
Look. Okay,
I didn't wanna have to go down this road,

14:32.456 --> 14:34.208
but we're gonna start talking
about your past.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.126
It's a waste of time.
There's nothing there.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.629
Come on,
everyone's got some childhood trauma.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.131
Not me. My family was very normal.

14:41.215 --> 14:42.841
Fine. I'll go first.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.926
When I was eight,

14:44.009 --> 14:47.679
my uncle used me as collateral
in a game of dominoes and lost.

14:47.763 --> 14:49.681
My mom had to drive
all the way out to Bakersfield

14:49.765 --> 14:51.600
to buy me back from a guy named Tim,

14:51.683 --> 14:53.685
and she was mad at me!

14:54.269 --> 14:58.815
Okay. Well, my parents were very nice
Midwestern people, you know?

14:58.899 --> 15:03.111
We just worked on the farm all day,
had dinner at 4:00, went to bed at 7:00.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.613
It was very peaceful.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.740
You know,
there was no screaming, no fighting,

15:06.823 --> 15:10.035
no crying, no hugging, no "I love yous,"

15:10.118 --> 15:12.871
no touching, no birthdays, no holidays.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.332
It was a nice, normal life.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.087
That is way darker than what I thought
you were gonna say.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.089
You need therapy immediately.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.966
Oh, no. Bad idea. I tried it once.

15:24.049 --> 15:26.927
He fell in love with me,
and I had to get a restraining order.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.680
Wow. Okay.
Well, we don't have time anyways.

15:29.763 --> 15:32.724
So, why don't I just look up
some chemicals that will make you cry

15:32.808 --> 15:34.768
and maybe we can put some onions
up your sleeve.

15:34.852 --> 15:35.894
Onions don't make me cry.

15:35.978 --> 15:38.939
Okay. Will you meet me halfway here?
You're not even trying!

15:51.618 --> 15:53.579
Found some paper towels
for us in the bathroom.

15:54.246 --> 15:55.163
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.088
Am I making it better?

16:04.673 --> 16:06.717
Kind of just spreading it around
a little bit,

16:06.800 --> 16:08.719
but honestly, it's working.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.305
Yeah, you were totally
my bodyguard back there.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.559
I've actually always kinda felt
like I had a Kevin Costner vibe.

16:16.226 --> 16:20.105
Yeah. I actually dressed up as him once
for Halloween.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.607
From what movie?

16:21.690 --> 16:24.151
No movie. Just dressed up as him.

16:24.234 --> 16:26.737
Yeah. I wore a shirt and slacks.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.865
But I carried myself, you know,
with his energy.

16:29.948 --> 16:30.991
Yeah.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.701
Well…

16:33.452 --> 16:35.329
Thank you again for being so brave.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.040
Yeah. I don't know what came over me.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.543
I saw that second pie,
and I just felt like I had to protect you.

16:42.544 --> 16:43.921
Well, it was really sweet.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.047
Yeah.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.717
Molly. I was worried.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.302
Thanks for coming.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.221
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm fine.

16:52.304 --> 16:56.016
I'm just mad and frustrated and sticky.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.309
Look at you.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.478
You need to rest. Come with me.
My helicopter's standing by.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.688
-Okay.
-Thank you so much, Arthur.

17:01.772 --> 17:02.648
Sure.

17:03.315 --> 17:04.316
Sure.

17:04.398 --> 17:06.401
You can take my car to go home
if you want.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.279
Yeah. You should take his car.
We're not using it.

17:09.363 --> 17:10.948
No, no. You don't have to do that.

17:11.031 --> 17:14.034
I think there's plenty
of Bird scooters out there I can grab.

17:14.535 --> 17:15.953
That'll take me to my bike.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.829
-Okay.
-All right.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.748
-Thank you again so much, huh?
-Sure.

17:45.107 --> 17:48.485
Okay. So I couldn't find
any menthol sticks to make you cry,

17:48.569 --> 17:51.113
but I did find some strawberry lip balm
and some Fritos.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.614
If we mix them together, it might work.

17:52.698 --> 17:54.741
Forget it.
I don't know why I'm doing this play.

17:54.825 --> 17:56.493
I'm gonna go out there
and embarrass myself.

17:56.577 --> 17:57.578
No, you're not.

17:57.661 --> 18:02.207
Listen,
could you just leave me alone, please?

18:13.010 --> 18:14.219
Hey, Tanya. Listen, I'm--

18:14.303 --> 18:16.388
I better be talking
to a motherfucking ghost right now,

18:16.471 --> 18:19.349
because you being dead is the only excuse
for you not answering the phone.

18:19.433 --> 18:21.560
Come on, baby. Just calm down.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.104
Go open yourself up a nice lime La Croix.
Take your shoes off.

18:24.188 --> 18:25.189
I'll be right there.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.357
Why the hell haven't you been answering
my calls?

18:27.441 --> 18:30.819
'Cause I've been busy helping Nicholas.
He's really needed me today.

18:30.903 --> 18:32.362
Nicholas? What about me?

18:32.446 --> 18:33.530
I asked you to do something,

18:33.614 --> 18:35.240
and you're running around
with some traitor.

18:35.324 --> 18:37.868
Howard, if you do not get off this phone,
get in the car

18:37.951 --> 18:40.287
-and drive to Orange County--
-Baby, this is really important to me.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.164
Did you just interrupt me
while I was talking?

18:42.247 --> 18:43.665
You are in a world of trouble.

18:43.749 --> 18:45.918
-If you don't get your ass--
-Tanya. Stop.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.252
I'm done with you.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.923
We're over. Goodbye.

19:14.613 --> 19:17.991
Wow. That's a perfect omelet. Thank you.

19:21.453 --> 19:24.331
This is nice. Really nice.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.458
You need to be more careful.

19:26.542 --> 19:27.584
I know.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.586
Sofia says it's important
to be there in person

19:29.670 --> 19:31.630
so the community can get to know us.

19:32.381 --> 19:33.757
And she says it makes sense

19:33.841 --> 19:36.635
that the public is suspicious
of someone like me.

19:36.718 --> 19:40.013
But that doesn't mean I deserve
to be called "Scrooge McFuckface."

19:41.348 --> 19:42.766
I know Sofia means well.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.979
But there are parts of our lives
she will never understand.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.023
No matter what we do,
some people will resent what we have.

19:50.107 --> 19:53.986
Then what am I doing every day?
I just feel like I can never win.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.822
No, there are ways we can help
without getting attacked.

19:57.447 --> 19:58.699
Think about the conference.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.243
No pies in the face,
and you can do great things there.

20:02.286 --> 20:05.330
Molly,
there is more than one way to be good.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.168
I like that.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.752
Let's go to Corsica early.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.797
You're gonna love it there.
It's so beautiful.

20:13.881 --> 20:18.385
And I don't know how it's possible,
but the sun sets for five hours.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.053
It never stops!

20:20.888 --> 20:22.347
That sounds pretty good.

20:23.015 --> 20:25.100
Now, can you make me
three more of these burrito omelets

20:25.184 --> 20:26.810
so I can take them on the plane?

20:27.311 --> 20:28.437
Anything for you.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.189
Thanks.

20:32.357 --> 20:35.068
"What are you doing here?
I told you I don't--"

20:35.152 --> 20:36.153
"Are you alone?"

20:42.159 --> 20:43.160
"I just thought that--"

20:44.661 --> 20:47.039
-Hey, is everything okay?
-Everything's fine.

20:47.122 --> 20:50.167
It's just that, before you go out there,
there's something I wanted to tell you.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.127
Okay.

20:52.211 --> 20:55.005
I know things have been weird
between us the past few weeks.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.759
But now I know those things you were
trying to tell me about Tanya, you--

20:59.259 --> 21:00.886
you were just trying to help me.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.056
I'm sorry I haven't been there for you.

21:04.139 --> 21:05.599
-It's okay. We're okay.
-Well, no!

21:05.682 --> 21:07.935
Before you go out there
and you fuck everything up,

21:08.018 --> 21:09.811
I need you to know you are good at this.

21:10.771 --> 21:11.939
I'm proud of you.

21:12.439 --> 21:13.815
And I love you.

21:13.899 --> 21:16.401
And I'm not saying this
as some co-worker or a fan.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.070
I'm saying this as your best friend.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.914
Places, everyone. Break legs! Break legs!

21:31.917 --> 21:33.210
You got this.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.128
-Thanks, man.
-Go get 'em.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.101
Everything's all right?

22:04.700 --> 22:06.201
Mom, what are you doing here?

22:06.994 --> 22:08.620
I said I wanted to be alone.

22:08.704 --> 22:10.706
He would have been so proud.

22:10.789 --> 22:14.459
Star quarterback in high school.
Top salesman in your firm.

22:14.543 --> 22:17.254
-Everything he always wanted for you.
-Yeah, then why is he gone?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.756
Dylan, do you think your father
chose to have cancer?

22:19.840 --> 22:22.134
I think he chose not to have the chemo.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.552
It's complicated!

22:23.635 --> 22:26.930
I'm so sick of hearing that!

22:27.806 --> 22:31.310
I'm so sick of living in his shadow.

22:31.894 --> 22:34.313
You don't think I don't see his face
everywhere I go?

22:35.439 --> 22:37.357
I don't hear what this town
says about him?

22:37.441 --> 22:40.944
"Mayor Moretti, the man who
brought the town back after the fire!"

22:41.028 --> 22:44.031
Well, none of that matters in the end.

22:45.699 --> 22:48.243
The only thing he ever did
that matters is die.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.414
And I didn't even get a chance
to say goodbye.

22:53.540 --> 22:59.171
Mom, that's all I want…
is just one more minute. With him.

23:00.589 --> 23:04.343
Just the two of us, in this old canoe.

23:06.303 --> 23:10.807
Watching the geese
make patterns in the sky…

23:12.643 --> 23:16.563
at our place on Cahoga Lake.

23:22.319 --> 23:23.320
Bravo!

23:32.496 --> 23:35.165
Bravo! Bravo.

23:43.006 --> 23:45.884
-Come here, superstar!
-Hey!

23:45.968 --> 23:47.928
Oh, my God.
Thank you guys so much for coming.

23:48.011 --> 23:49.137
You were amazing!

23:49.221 --> 23:52.516
Oh, my God. When you said
the title of the play in the play,

23:52.599 --> 23:56.019
-I didn't know you could do that!
-It was so emotional.

23:56.103 --> 23:57.479
The way you were sanding the canoe,

23:57.563 --> 24:00.148
it was like you were shaving away
all the fear and resentment that--

24:00.232 --> 24:02.067
Yeah. Yeah, no.
That's not what that meant, Ainsley.

24:02.150 --> 24:04.653
Okay. I also liked the costumes.

24:05.404 --> 24:09.825
You know, I liked the sexual tension
between your character and Linda.

24:09.908 --> 24:11.243
So intense.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.287
Rhonda, Linda was his mom.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.705
No, I know.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.374
Okay. Well, I wouldn't have even been here
today if it wasn't for this guy.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.834
He's the one who got me up there.

24:18.917 --> 24:22.379
Come on, I already cried tonight.
Don't get these waterworks going.

24:22.462 --> 24:25.465
Hi. I have a delivery from Molly Wells.

24:25.549 --> 24:26.550
Thanks.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.468
Weird.

24:29.803 --> 24:32.681
It says, "So sorry I couldn't make it.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.309
I'm sure you were amazing.
Enjoy this on me."

24:36.185 --> 24:37.186
Wow.

24:38.353 --> 24:42.441
2006 Louis Roederer Cristal.
That's really nice.

24:45.194 --> 24:47.863
All right. Well, let's head to the bar.
Crack that baby open.

24:47.946 --> 24:49.781
All the rest of the drinks
are on me tonight.

24:49.865 --> 24:50.908
-Okay.
-Thank you.

24:50.991 --> 24:53.076
-Sofia!
-All right. Let's go!

24:56.246 --> 24:57.539
What are you gonna order?

24:57.623 --> 24:59.541
I think I'm gonna have a gin and tonic.

25:15.182 --> 25:16.683
We'll be landing soon.
