All right.
Let's see what he's got.

14:46.351 --> 14:49.186
<i>[ Donatello ]</i>
<i>Carter says he can get us</i>
<i>inside Dregg's tower, April.</i>

14:49.220 --> 14:52.189
That's some trick
to get through that
state-of-the-art security.

14:52.256 --> 14:54.692
This I gotta see.
I'll be there.

15:00.598 --> 15:03.300
[ Leonardo ]
This place could stand
a little sprucing up.

15:05.103 --> 15:07.872
- [ Carter ]
Lookin' for me?
- Okay, Carter. Let's go.

15:08.807 --> 15:10.341
[ Michelangelo ]
The Hi-Tech!

15:10.409 --> 15:12.276
You deviant scum
aren't going anywhere--

15:14.880 --> 15:17.014
except as my prisoners.

15:17.082 --> 15:19.016
Dudes, can it be that--

15:19.084 --> 15:22.253
I'd say
our so-called friend
just sold us out.

15:26.991 --> 15:30.094
Come on! Let's take
these mecha-maniacs!

15:30.162 --> 15:33.097
[ Leonardo ]
There's too many of 'em!

15:33.998 --> 15:35.699
Hit the deck!

15:44.242 --> 15:46.076
[ All Shouting ]

15:47.312 --> 15:48.946
What the--

15:52.650 --> 15:54.451
Well done, Carter.

15:54.519 --> 15:58.556
You have proven your worth
to our master, Lord Dregg.

15:58.623 --> 16:01.759
I can't believe it.
Carter set us up.

16:07.465 --> 16:10.134
[ Car Approaching ]

16:13.805 --> 16:16.607
[ April ]
Could things
get any worse?

16:16.675 --> 16:19.310
[ Screeching ]

16:19.377 --> 16:23.614
Oh, if I'm gonna help
the Turtles expose Dregg
for the fraud he really is,

16:23.681 --> 16:25.583
I've gotta follow them.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.321
Oh, here goes nothing!
[ Grunts ]

16:55.012 --> 16:57.481
[ Gasps, Screams ]

16:57.549 --> 16:59.616
[ Grunting ]

17:00.751 --> 17:04.054
Looks like there's no place
to go but... down!

17:06.723 --> 17:09.693
Where's Carter?
How did you get him
to betray us, Dregg?

17:09.761 --> 17:12.863
You should
choose your friends
more wisely, mutant.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.032
The lad was only too happy
to sell you out.

17:16.099 --> 17:19.069
And you might consider
following his example.

17:19.137 --> 17:23.607
- What?
- You're mutants, freaks,
outcasts of society.

17:23.674 --> 17:26.743
You have no loyalty
to those... humans.

17:26.810 --> 17:29.113
You're better than they are.

17:29.180 --> 17:31.382
Why not join me?

17:31.450 --> 17:35.453
And together
we will rule this world!

17:35.520 --> 17:38.856
Are you through?
Go suck an egg,
space scum!

17:38.923 --> 17:41.825
If you will not join me,

17:41.893 --> 17:44.161
you will be destroyed!
[ Beeps ]

17:46.931 --> 17:49.166
[ Power Humming ]

17:49.234 --> 17:51.568
[ Michelangelo ]
Oh, man. Not that thing again!

17:52.970 --> 17:55.205
We've gotta get out
of these clamps somehow.

17:55.273 --> 17:59.410
There's something
on the side of these slabs.
It could be a release switch.

17:59.477 --> 18:01.912
Try and reach it.

18:01.979 --> 18:05.482
[ Raphael ]
Make it fast, dudes,
before we get fricasseed!

18:05.550 --> 18:08.385
[ Grunts ]
Can't quite reach it.

18:10.455 --> 18:11.955
What in the--

18:12.023 --> 18:14.691
My arm?
What's happening to it?

18:14.759 --> 18:18.361
Guys, I think our mutations
are changing!

18:18.429 --> 18:20.864
As if we didn't have
enough problems.

18:23.634 --> 18:26.437
I'd say maybe we just got
a preview of our future.

18:26.504 --> 18:29.406
Dude, if we don't
get out of here, we aren't
gonna have a future.

18:30.541 --> 18:33.677
- Hang on, guys!
- Carter, what are you doing?

18:33.744 --> 18:36.346
Getting you out of here.

18:42.253 --> 18:45.489
What's the matter, Carter?
Have a sudden attack
of conscience?

18:45.623 --> 18:48.225
Yeah. You nearly got
our shells roasted.

18:48.292 --> 18:50.995
Sorry, guys.
Things didn't go
exactly as I planned.

18:51.062 --> 18:53.097
But I got you inside
the building, didn't I?

18:53.164 --> 18:55.665
You mean, you didn't
really switch sides?

18:55.733 --> 18:59.436
You think I'd join
that space creep,
betray the whole human race?

18:59.504 --> 19:02.773
No way! Besides, I found out
what Dregg's up to.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.475
And we gotta work fast.

19:04.542 --> 19:08.778
All right, Carter.
But from now on,
be a team player.

19:08.846 --> 19:10.614
You got it.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.184
Dregg's turning
this whole building
into a fortress.

19:14.251 --> 19:17.154
We got to shut down
the weapons system
before he gets it online.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.723
But this place
is like a maze.
How are we gonna find it?

19:19.790 --> 19:21.725
[ Communicator Chirps ]

19:21.792 --> 19:23.827
<i>It's April, guys.</i>
<i>I'm in the basement.</i>

19:23.895 --> 19:26.163
There's some kind of
huge arsenal down here.

19:26.231 --> 19:28.065
Does that answer
your question?

19:28.132 --> 19:30.000
Hang on, April.
We're on our way.

19:30.068 --> 19:32.736
Now, what's the fastest way
to the basement?

19:32.803 --> 19:34.204
Try the elevator, dude!

19:37.942 --> 19:39.943
Cowabunga!

19:41.378 --> 19:43.380
[ Donatello ]
If we can link
the systems together,

19:43.448 --> 19:45.849
a single explosion
should take
all the weapons out.

19:45.917 --> 19:48.719
Great! But how do we
set off the explosion?

19:48.786 --> 19:52.622
Uh, that part I haven't
figured out yet.

19:52.690 --> 19:54.391
I've got the whole arsenal
on tape.

19:54.525 --> 19:58.228
This will show the world
what a warlord Dregg really is.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.097
[ Beeps ]
The systems
are all linked.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.467
Now to set them off...
somehow.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.536
You won't be setting
anything off.

20:05.603 --> 20:07.705
Destroy them!

20:07.772 --> 20:12.075
Dudes, we are
way outnumbered!

20:12.143 --> 20:13.611
But not out-weaponed.

20:16.814 --> 20:18.849
Back off, metal mouth.

Yaah! Aah! Yaah!

20:22.087 --> 20:23.520
[ Grunts ]

20:25.223 --> 20:28.525
You will pay dearly for
deceiving Lord Dregg, human.

Carter's in trouble!

20:35.433 --> 20:37.934
Gotta... get... free.

is Carter!

Wow. That kid's
just full of surprises.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.427
Whoa. Way to go, Carter!

21:10.601 --> 21:14.571
You fool!
A stray blast could destroy
this whole building!

21:14.639 --> 21:16.940
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

21:17.008 --> 21:19.309
Yeah. If we could
get Dregg mad enough...

21:19.377 --> 21:21.845
and lure him over
near those missiles--

21:26.284 --> 21:28.952
[ Whistles ]
Hey, fish face!
Over here!

21:29.019 --> 21:33.156

of your shell!

21:36.427 --> 21:38.361
Come on, space cadet.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.597
Yeah, hit us
with your best shot.

21:40.665 --> 21:42.732
That I will!

21:42.800 --> 21:44.401
[ Grunts ]

21:45.736 --> 21:47.971
You will pay for this, deviants!

21:48.039 --> 21:52.609
I am Dregg,
Supreme Warlord of the Galaxy!

21:52.677 --> 21:55.279
Oh, yeah?
You look like
a big loser to me.

21:55.346 --> 21:59.082
I'll show you.
I'll show the world!

No! No!

Weapons systems overload.
To the <i> Dreggnaught.</i>

22:10.861 --> 22:12.595
We must flee.

22:20.271 --> 22:22.305
No time, April.
We gotta book!

22:22.373 --> 22:24.808
But it's got the record
of Dregg's evil.

22:24.876 --> 22:26.876
We gotta go!

22:47.966 --> 22:50.433
And when I spilled a drop
of that mutagen on me,

22:50.501 --> 22:53.103
I had no idea
anything like this
would happen.

22:53.170 --> 22:57.207
Whoa. That means
the mutagen's even more
unstable than we thought.

22:57.275 --> 22:59.610
That might explain
the bizarro arm trick.

22:59.677 --> 23:01.611
I don't know
if I can handle all this.

23:01.679 --> 23:05.348
Your mutation can be
a great boon... or a curse.

23:05.416 --> 23:07.250
The choice is up to you.

23:07.318 --> 23:11.488
But, Sensei,
your mutation could
be changing too.

23:11.556 --> 23:14.191
The future is fraught
with mystery for all of us.
