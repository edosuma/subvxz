01:17.040 --> 01:18.712
Last week on Married With Children...

01:18.920 --> 01:22.356
...Kelly got her own talk show
on public-access TV.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.878
Who do you think
has the cutest butt?

01:27.120 --> 01:28.348
Mel Gibson.

01:28.560 --> 01:32.473
Lethal Weapon opening tomorrow!

01:32.680 --> 01:35.911
It was a success,
and everyone auditioned.

01:54.160 --> 01:57.072
Kelly said she'd think about it.

01:58.160 --> 02:02.597
But she went it alone.
And that strategy paid off, because. ;

02:02.800 --> 02:04.995
A real network wants
to put my show on primetime.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.553
- I'm going to Hollywood!
- What?

02:06.760 --> 02:07.749
- Hollywood?
- Yes! Yes!

02:07.960 --> 02:12.078
And now,
Married With Children continues.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.430
I can't believe
we're going to Hollywood.

02:15.640 --> 02:17.119
It's a dream come true.

02:17.360 --> 02:20.670
The place where any guy with a cheap
chain can call himself a producer...

02:20.880 --> 02:24.156
...to dumb babes getting off the bus
from Des Moines.

02:25.480 --> 02:29.678
Dad, your little boy's going home.

02:31.040 --> 02:35.716
I'm sure that Grumpy, Dopey, Sleepy
and Doc will be glad to have you back.

02:35.960 --> 02:39.350
Now, kids, before we go
to the land of broken dreams...

02:39.560 --> 02:43.678
...and cheap bikini love,
I want you to be prepared.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.793
Because Hollywood is not like
our quaint little hometown of Chicago.

02:52.560 --> 02:55.279
People in Hollywood are
always out for the quick buck.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.516
They're nothing
but a bunch of brownnosers.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.073
Now, I want you to remember...

02:59.280 --> 03:04.400
...that the only people who really care
about you as a person is your family.

03:05.440 --> 03:09.194
Hi, everyone. I hear you're going to
Hollywood and I wanted to come by...

03:09.400 --> 03:12.551
...and give you my best wishes.
And I don't want anything.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.268
Well, that's nice,
but you're blocking the door.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.155
Oh, really? Oh, well, I didn't mean to.

03:22.040 --> 03:23.314
Goodbye.

03:23.880 --> 03:27.475
Oh, but before you go,
there's just one thing I wanna say.

03:29.080 --> 03:34.029
I am willing to leave my husband
if you will just take me with you.

03:34.280 --> 03:35.508
I will do anything for you.

03:35.720 --> 03:41.989
I will procure for your little brother,
I will brush your father's teeth.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.792
Hey, I will even be your bodyguard.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.468
Let me prove myself
by killing someone.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.070
Just point to someone you don't like
and I'll happily kill him.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.630
- Kiss him goodbye.
- Now, Marcie, just a second, here!

03:56.880 --> 04:00.668
Now, why don't you just... out of here.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.071
I mean, we got a plane to catch.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.754
Oh, please, take me with you.

04:10.000 --> 04:14.471
I'm a pregnant banker jet-skiing
towards 40, for God's sake!

04:14.680 --> 04:17.069
I was voted Most Likely to Succeed
in high school...

04:17.279 --> 04:18.872
...and I have a reunion coming up.

04:19.079 --> 04:22.709
At least let me be able to say
that I slept with Chuck Woolery.

04:24.080 --> 04:27.277
Ease by her carefully, kids.
They say the mad have strength.

04:30.880 --> 04:32.916
Hey, hey, at least let me be
Slut of the Week.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.429
I'm already pregnant!

05:01.440 --> 05:05.069
Take a deep breath, kids,
and smell that show biz.

05:08.080 --> 05:11.152
I can't believe we're at the hub
of the NBS network.

05:11.360 --> 05:13.191
This is where it all happens.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.674
Did you see the bathroom?

05:14.880 --> 05:17.997
I tell you, I'm still giddy
with the thought that just possibly...

05:18.200 --> 05:21.351
...I might have sat on
the same toilet seat as Bob Hope.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.238
Yeah, Dad, but I'm sure Bob Hope
didn't walk out of the stall...

05:25.440 --> 05:29.353
...with his pants around his ankles
proudly singing "That's Entertainment."

05:30.320 --> 05:31.912
You loved it when you were 3.

05:32.880 --> 05:36.873
I can't believe we're actually here.
And it's all because of my little girl.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.756
It's times like this that I wish
I'd stayed home nights and studied...

05:40.960 --> 05:43.349
...so I could make something
of myself, like Bud.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.431
Okay, kids, enough fun.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.437
We don't wanna miss
the big picture here.

05:50.640 --> 05:51.914
We are in the loop.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.712
Just look at those walls.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.229
Kids, we can be among the first...

05:56.440 --> 06:00.638
...to see the new, exciting shows
on the fall schedule.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.398
Gaze proudly, kids.

06:02.600 --> 06:03.828
Oh, just think.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.749
Someday my picture will be hanging
next to such exciting shows as...

06:08.480 --> 06:11.597
"Ellen and Her Dog"?

06:11.800 --> 06:15.315
"Spik e Le Bee,
New York City School Teacher"?

06:16.920 --> 06:19.957
"Art Allante, PI."

06:20.920 --> 06:23.878
"Black Cop, White Girl."

06:28.240 --> 06:30.754
"Me and the Shiksa"?

06:33.120 --> 06:36.157
"The Homeless Detective."

06:39.200 --> 06:40.474
Oh, come on.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.876
Daddy, do they
have to hang my picture here?

06:44.080 --> 06:46.116
- It's Gig!
- Gig, can I have your autograph?

06:46.320 --> 06:50.916
Oh, my God. It's Gig Fontaine,
star of Tugboat Danger.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.639
Gig, please, please.

06:52.840 --> 06:57.152
I love you. I love you all.
But I'll love you first.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.753
I can't believe this.

06:58.960 --> 07:01.269
- Give us a smile, Gig.
- Just an autograph, please?

07:01.480 --> 07:04.199
Gig! Gig!

07:05.760 --> 07:07.637
What's that guy got that I don't?

07:07.840 --> 07:10.673
Shall I start above
or below the waist?

07:10.880 --> 07:13.553
Daddy, did you see how
those people were surrounding him...

07:13.760 --> 07:16.877
...just so he'd sign his name?
Do you think that'll happen to me?

07:17.320 --> 07:20.995
Well, probably not until
you learn how to spell your name.

07:21.240 --> 07:23.117
Well, I have something to say.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.673
If I become rich and famous...

07:24.880 --> 07:27.440
...I am gonna share it
with everyone that I love.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.835
Oh, and you guys too.

07:30.560 --> 07:34.519
Daddy, I am gonna get you a car
with door handles and a gas cap.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.517
And a rear-view mirror...

07:36.720 --> 07:39.837
...not just one of Mom's old compacts
glued to the window.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.789
- And windshield wipers?
- You got it, big guy.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.030
And I'm gonna get Mom
what she's always wanted.

07:47.240 --> 07:49.674
Maybe that young guy
down the block who paints houses.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.351
And, Bud, get me a Coke, will you?

07:57.520 --> 08:00.876
Hi, I'm Jeff Littlehead. Now...

08:02.920 --> 08:05.753
Which one of you is Kelly Bundy?

08:06.480 --> 08:07.595
That would be I.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.917
Welcome to NBS,
where we say quality counts.

08:13.120 --> 08:15.156
We don't believe it, but we say it.

08:17.120 --> 08:19.680
You reek of avocado.

08:19.880 --> 08:23.555
Now, be nice, Bud.
They eat vegetables in Hollywood.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.671
And we are a stranger in his land.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.797
Now, there are no strangers
here at NBS...

08:28.000 --> 08:31.959
...if you don't mind me kissing
a little heinie for a moment.

08:32.159 --> 08:34.150
We're like a big family.
That's what we are.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.989
A big, happy family. Living, loving,
nurturing and supporting our talent.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.236
Here we never forget your name.

08:40.440 --> 08:42.078
Mr. Littlehead?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.949
- Who are you?
- Rock Turboman.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.237
Oh, glad to meet you.
I'll have a hamburger.

08:48.480 --> 08:51.597
No, I'm the star of your new series,
Young Ben Franklin.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.957
Yes, yes, I know.
Well, what can I do for you?

08:55.200 --> 08:57.031
Well, I know the ratings
have been low...

08:57.240 --> 08:59.708
...but I'm kind of thinking
of buying a new house.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.434
You think I should?
We're not being cancelled, are we?

09:02.680 --> 09:05.148
Oh, son, son, damn the ratings.
We love the show.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.510
America loves the show.
It'll be on forever.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.153
You, you buy that house.

09:09.360 --> 09:12.238
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- All right. All right, Ben Franklin.

09:12.440 --> 09:15.910
Electricity! Bifocals! Kites!

09:16.120 --> 09:19.157
He's gone.
I cancelled him this morning.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.155
You'll have his time slot.

09:22.480 --> 09:25.040
Hey, Dad, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:25.240 --> 09:28.516
- That he can get both of us chicks?
- Yeah.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.556
Well, are you ready to see your set?

09:32.080 --> 09:34.514
Lead on, Mr. Littlething.

09:37.040 --> 09:42.478
Well, it's Littlehead,
but, well, you can call me anything.

09:42.680 --> 09:46.229
Just don't call me late
to a Dick Chamberlain miniseries.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.910
Oh, Daddy, we're gonna
go look at my set.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.439
I really feel like a star.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.989
Pumpkin, to me
you've always been a star.

09:58.200 --> 10:01.988
Oh, please. Just the other day you
were saying when you were a boy...

10:02.200 --> 10:05.158
...you used to water things
smarter than her.

10:05.400 --> 10:08.915
Well, you said, "What's the difference
between Kelly Bundy and an elephant?

10:09.120 --> 10:12.396
One is grey, has four legs and a tail,
and the other's a moron."

10:13.400 --> 10:16.278
- Well, you told me that joke about...
- Okay, now, time-out, guys.

10:16.480 --> 10:20.439
Let's not fight. This should be
a happy moment. Okay?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.599
I'd like my checks
sent to me directly.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.400
I'll deliver them personally.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.117
Right this way, Miss Bundy.

10:37.080 --> 10:39.548
Arigato, gentlemen.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.958
This, Miss Bundy, is all yours.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.517
Yes!

11:22.960 --> 11:28.956
Oh, God, I don't believe this.
I mean, all this for me.

11:29.360 --> 11:33.797
I just want you to know that if I become
a success, I will never change.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.672
Great.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.957
Are you really the guy
in Home Alone?

11:46.120 --> 11:47.872
Yes!

11:48.080 --> 11:53.234
Now, listen, if you two lovely young
ladies would like to be in the sequel...

11:53.440 --> 11:56.193
...Home Alone With Sex Toy...

11:57.320 --> 12:00.278
...just write down your names
and numbers here.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.236
I also wrote down my special talents.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.396
There's five minutes to rehearsal,
Miss Bundy.

12:14.880 --> 12:17.075
Oh, God. Oh, God.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.473
- Daddy?
- Oh, just a second, pumpkin.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.233
Now, Jeff, I've been thinking.

12:22.440 --> 12:26.479
Just in case this new fall season,
you know, shall we say, blows...

12:26.680 --> 12:29.274
...I've been fooling around
with some ideas for new shows.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.517
Let's run this up the flagpole,
see if it waves. Stay with me here.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.073
There's this mystic guy...

12:34.280 --> 12:37.317
...wandering across the West
in search of his long-Iost brother.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.078
Now, instead of guns...

12:39.280 --> 12:40.679
Get this.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.759
- He's fitted with an assortment
of fighting footwear.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.755
It's called Kung Shoe.

12:54.760 --> 12:57.115
- Now, Daddy?
- Not quite yet, pumpkin.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.231
I think I got him hooked.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.953
Okay, here's another idea.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.833
Let's toss this in the oven,
see if it bakes.

13:04.920 --> 13:11.473
Now, there's a shoe salesman
in the 23rd century, called Shoe Trek.

13:15.760 --> 13:17.113
Okay, I got another idea.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.630
Let's toss this in the bed with Madonna
and see if she sleeps with it.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.353
Now, this has nothing
to do with shoes...

13:24.560 --> 13:27.950
...but it's a hot idea
and I'd like to be personally involved.

13:28.160 --> 13:30.276
It's called Breasts.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.671
I just don't feel it.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.555
What a surprise, huh?

13:39.560 --> 13:41.516
All right, pumpkin, I want a five.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.515
Daddy, I'm scared.
I mean, what if I'm not any good?

13:45.720 --> 13:47.438
What if my intellectual bons mots...

13:47.640 --> 13:51.633
...and witty little intersections
are only appreciated in Chicago?

13:51.840 --> 13:55.594
I mean, back there
I was a big fish in a small bottle...

13:55.800 --> 13:59.793
...but now I'm in Los Angeles,
the Big Apple.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.308
What if I stink?

14:02.720 --> 14:06.759
Pumpkin, I want you to have
as much confidence in yourself...

14:06.960 --> 14:08.837
...as I had in my own self.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.554
Of course, my present lack
of faith is understandable...

14:11.760 --> 14:15.036
...since your average parking meter
makes more a day than I do.

14:15.240 --> 14:16.753
But don't you worry.

14:16.960 --> 14:21.272
You can be a huge success because
you have what every Bundy has:

14:21.480 --> 14:23.038
Cute.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.550
We're irresistible.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.310
So you can succeed at anything.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.074
- Because I'm special?
- No! Because it's show business.

14:32.280 --> 14:34.316
You don't need talent or brains.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.150
Thank you, Daddy.

14:40.040 --> 14:41.871
We're ready for rehearsal,
Miss Bundy.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.835
- Wish me luck.
- Pumpkin, I wish you more than luck.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.794
I wish you satisfaction and success.

14:53.320 --> 14:55.880
Because if you are a success,
I'll be so rich...

14:56.080 --> 14:59.629
...I'll be able to hire somebody else to
put their hands down my pants for me.

15:05.040 --> 15:09.636
Rehearsal in three, two, one...

15:09.840 --> 15:12.638
Welcome to
Vital Social Issues 'N Stuff with Kelly.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.717
I'm Kelly.

15:15.960 --> 15:18.394
Okay, be cool. We're on TV.

15:18.600 --> 15:22.832
Now, as you know if you were watching
channel 99 in Chicago last week...

15:23.040 --> 15:25.156
...our topic was men's butts.

15:25.360 --> 15:28.989
Now, we all felt that we didn't
explore men's butts sufficiently.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.909
In fact, one butt
was left totally uncovered.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.199
So to make it up to him...

15:35.400 --> 15:39.313
...the Vital Social Issues 'N Stuff
with Kelly Butt of the Year is...

15:41.720 --> 15:43.392
...Jason Priestley.

15:43.600 --> 15:47.275
Beverly Hills, 90210!

15:49.240 --> 15:51.515
Two palms up.

16:01.240 --> 16:05.233
And if he is watching, we are staying
at the fabulous Motel Two...

16:05.440 --> 16:08.318
...on the corner of Ghetto and Gang.

16:08.920 --> 16:13.436
Oh, turn left at the hobo
who calls himself Moondoggie.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.349
And now, on to an issue and stuff
that really sticks in my drawer.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.312
Bad dates.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.597
Roberta, why don't you tell us
and the entire nation...

16:22.800 --> 16:26.429
...the story you told us after we all
swore that we would never tell anyone?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.717
Sure.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.674
Johnny DiBedetto.
He takes me to a movie...

16:32.880 --> 16:34.757
...and you know how he likes
to put his tongue in your ear?

16:35.000 --> 16:37.150
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's right.

16:39.200 --> 16:41.919
Well, he goes at it,
and the next thing I know...

16:42.120 --> 16:45.032
...he sucked my earring
down his throat.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.150
Not the blue ones
with the chains that hang?

16:49.760 --> 16:53.912
He can't do anything right.
He once stuck his tongue in my eye.

16:54.720 --> 16:58.998
Me too. He swallowed my contacts.

16:59.440 --> 17:03.513
He missed my entire head
and got my dog, Wilbur.

17:04.079 --> 17:07.914
Well, girls, what we've learned here is
that if you ever go out with Johnny...

17:09.440 --> 17:12.829
...don't wear anything that'll fit down
his throat. You stink, Johnny.

17:17.520 --> 17:20.512
- He is kind of cute, though, isn't he?
- Yeah.

17:20.720 --> 17:23.791
Okay. Now I would like
to introduce our band:

17:24.000 --> 17:26.355
Joanie and the Slashettes.

17:29.040 --> 17:30.439
Girls?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.995
Two, three, four...

17:34.280 --> 17:36.077
Sex!

17:42.000 --> 17:43.956
Well, I'm jelly.

17:45.360 --> 17:49.433
We'll be right back with our resident
bad-perm victim, Jeannie.

17:53.920 --> 17:57.310
This week, Jeannie has agreed
to let us shave her head.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.393
Might as well. It's ruined.

18:03.400 --> 18:04.799
Cut!

18:06.160 --> 18:09.550
That was great. God, it was fabulous.

18:09.760 --> 18:13.070
It was now, brown cow.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.788
Thank you, Mr. Littlepants.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.315
And thank you for
letting me do my own vision.

18:19.520 --> 18:23.069
My own creation.
The fruit of my own loins.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.271
- You really liked it?
- Oh, it was great.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.233
You stepped up to the plate
in the bottom of the ninth...

18:28.440 --> 18:31.750
...with the bases loaded, trailing
4-1 in St. Louis on a hot afternoon...

18:31.960 --> 18:34.394
...100 degrees,
120 on the natural turf.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.114
And the wind-up,
and here's the pitch. It's a hit!

18:37.320 --> 18:40.312
That ball's going back, back,
way back, to the back of the wall.

18:40.520 --> 18:44.638
Grand slam! And look!
Some lucky fan's got the ball right now.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.071
And he wants your autograph!
Where's your pen?

18:56.920 --> 18:59.593
Daddy, what the hell
is he talking about?

19:00.040 --> 19:02.918
Just smile at the suit, pumpkin.

19:03.920 --> 19:07.549
What I'm saying is, we love what
you're doing. Don't change a thing.

19:07.760 --> 19:12.276
But before you go on, we just have
a few tiny little suggestions.

19:16.760 --> 19:19.957
I can't believe they ruined
then cancelled my show.

19:20.160 --> 19:24.358
Now, pumpkin, they just used research
and testing to mould the show...

19:24.560 --> 19:27.074
...into something they felt
really related to the teens.

19:27.280 --> 19:29.396
As we shall see,
research is never wrong.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.358
And now, here's Kelly Bundy.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.270
Hi. Welcome to my show. I'm Kelly.

19:41.480 --> 19:46.031
Today we're gonna talk about
making our parents' lives easier.

19:46.720 --> 19:49.678
- Neat.
- Keen.

19:49.880 --> 19:51.757
Dy-no-mite.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.912
You kids aren't just whistling Dixie.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.157
Now let's hear a number
from our band.

19:59.960 --> 20:02.428
Two, three, four...

20:07.720 --> 20:09.278
Milk.

20:11.680 --> 20:14.831
Thank you, Joanie and the Hepcats.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.508
Now, let's talk seriously
for a moment.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.438
We all wanna make
our parents happy...

20:19.640 --> 20:22.393
...because they gave us
this precious gift of life.

20:22.600 --> 20:25.034
Isn't that right,
fellow virgin teens just waiting...

20:25.240 --> 20:27.151
...for the right man to come along?

20:28.960 --> 20:31.315
- Neato.
- Right.

20:31.560 --> 20:36.475
We'll be right back with library books,
the perfect Friday-night date.

20:36.680 --> 20:37.954
Band?

20:44.280 --> 20:45.474
Book.

20:56.280 --> 21:00.273
- I didn't like my hair.
- Please.

21:00.480 --> 21:04.473
You know something?
There is a bright side to all of this.

21:04.680 --> 21:08.878
- What's that, Daddy?
- It's that nothing bad happened to me.

21:09.880 --> 21:13.236
I mean, it's possible
that the Bundy cloud of failure...

21:13.440 --> 21:17.558
...passed through me onto my children,
as I only dared to dream.

21:18.080 --> 21:21.197
I mean, imagine,
nothing bad happened to me.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.190
Next week, NBS presents
a new, exciting miniseries. ;

21:25.400 --> 21:28.790
Joe Piscopo in Shoe Trek.

21:31.520 --> 21:34.193
The shoe sizes are down, captain.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.796
Mr. Sock, heels on stun.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.754
Well, that's it. From now on,
nothing but cable for me.

21:42.960 --> 21:45.952
Send money for the children.

21:46.800 --> 21:51.237
Loofa the wrinkles away
the Ernest Borgnine way.

21:51.440 --> 21:56.958
Hey, senior citizens,
are you losing your hearing?

21:57.400 --> 22:01.439
Are you man enough
for a penile implant?
