WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:03.829
[clock ticking]

00:18.061 --> 00:19.889
Ow!

00:20.063 --> 00:21.412
What happened? Are you okay?

00:22.587 --> 00:23.501
Yeah,

00:23.675 --> 00:25.112
nothing a
little sleep

00:25.286 --> 00:26.635
can't fix.

00:26.809 --> 00:28.245
Here, let me heal that.No.

00:28.419 --> 00:30.726
Come on.I said no.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.075
Piper, this is ridiculous.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.250
We have to talk about this.

00:33.424 --> 00:34.860
Actually, what we need to do

00:35.035 --> 00:36.906
is find where the next
demon attack is gonna be.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.039
And I think I just did.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.259
Pentagram...
naturally.

00:42.433 --> 00:44.044
What do you want from me?

00:44.218 --> 00:45.610
What do I have to do to prove
that I've changed?

00:45.784 --> 00:47.047
That I'm okay?

00:51.703 --> 00:53.792
Did Phoebe and Paige
finish making the dye?

00:53.966 --> 00:55.142
You didn't answer my question.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.491
Oh, I have to answer
your questions,

00:56.665 --> 00:57.970
but you don't
have to answer mine?

00:58.145 --> 00:59.276
What question?The same question I've been

00:59.450 --> 01:01.017
asking you for several days now.

01:01.191 --> 01:02.497
What aren't you telling me?

01:02.671 --> 01:03.715
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:03.889 --> 01:07.415
Oh, right. Excuse me.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.115
I can't get into this
with you right now, okay?

01:12.289 --> 01:14.204
I've got an
invisible demon

01:14.378 --> 01:15.771
killing Innocents
and for all we know,

01:15.945 --> 01:17.512
they could be working
with the Avatars.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.340
They're not working
with the Avatars.

01:19.514 --> 01:21.037
Oh, yeah? How
do you know?

01:21.211 --> 01:22.865
I don't! I mean-- I just...

01:23.039 --> 01:24.084
I don't think
they're the threat

01:24.258 --> 01:25.389
everyone thinks
they are.
Why?

01:25.563 --> 01:26.869
Because if they're so

01:27.043 --> 01:28.740
powerful, wouldn't they
have attacked by now?

01:28.914 --> 01:30.916
Uh, sending a demon
to possess you doesn't count?

01:31.091 --> 01:33.223
Still, I think
that was their way

01:33.397 --> 01:35.747
of communicating
with me... with us.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.533
Why didn't they
just try calling you, Leo?

01:39.925 --> 01:41.231
Are you hiding something?

01:41.405 --> 01:43.233
No.Yes.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.802
Are you sure
those are gonna work?

01:46.976 --> 01:49.239
Yeah, as sure as I can be
at 5:00 a.m.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.111
Before you go...
PHOEBE:
Do you know where
the demon is

01:51.285 --> 01:53.069
gonna attack?They're making a pentagram

01:53.243 --> 01:54.418
and there's only one point left,

01:54.592 --> 01:56.551
so we need to get there
before sunrise.

01:56.725 --> 01:57.987
Piper, you can't
walk out on this.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.816
You're right.
We should orb.

02:00.990 --> 02:01.947
16th and Mission.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.123
PAIGE:
Got it.

02:05.081 --> 02:06.865
Damn it.

02:07.039 --> 02:09.172
I said no!

02:16.658 --> 02:18.399
Ow!

02:18.573 --> 02:19.443
What happened?

02:20.531 --> 02:21.837
Nothing a
little sleep

02:22.011 --> 02:22.881
won't fix. It's fine.

02:23.055 --> 02:24.274
Didn't you just say that?

02:24.448 --> 02:25.275
What?

02:25.449 --> 02:27.756
Nothing.

02:27.930 --> 02:30.628
I think I found where the next
demon attack is gonna be.

02:30.802 --> 02:34.632
A pentagram...
naturally.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.246
Did Phoebe and Paige
finish that dye yet?

02:39.420 --> 02:41.291
I don't know.

02:42.814 --> 02:43.989
Excuse me.

02:50.431 --> 02:52.694
Why did you do this?

02:52.868 --> 02:55.218
We didn't.
You did.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.526
You need to be more careful

02:58.700 --> 03:01.006
about your new powers, Leo.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.835

03:04.009 --> 03:06.490

Our powers are not
meant to be used

04:41.019 --> 04:43.500
for personal reasons, Leo.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.807
You know that.

04:45.981 --> 04:48.200
I know.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.767
I didn't mean to.
It just happened.

04:49.941 --> 04:53.162
Yes, because you
wanted it to happen.

04:53.336 --> 04:56.339
You must be more careful
in the future.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.472
Learn to control your emotions.

04:58.646 --> 05:02.650
ALPHA:
Control is the first
discipline of an Avatar.

05:02.824 --> 05:05.696
Otherwise our powers
can become dangerous

05:05.870 --> 05:09.004
to others as well
as to ourselves.

05:09.178 --> 05:11.049
What do you mean?Reversing time

05:11.223 --> 05:13.225
the way you did
requires great power.

05:13.400 --> 05:16.098
It drains the collective
and it puts us at risk.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.622
And we must remain
at full strength

05:18.796 --> 05:22.104
if we are to defeat
the forces of evil,

05:22.278 --> 05:25.542
if we are to implement
the change.

05:25.716 --> 05:26.804
I get that.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.111
But Piper's my wife.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.417
She knows something's up.

05:30.591 --> 05:31.809
I can't keep lying to her.

05:31.983 --> 05:34.551
We understand
your position, Leo.

05:34.725 --> 05:35.987
But to tell
her outright

05:36.161 --> 05:37.728
might cause her
to overreact

05:37.902 --> 05:39.774
and mistakenly view us
as a threat.

05:39.948 --> 05:42.080
As might her
sisters as well.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.692
They must come to the truth
in their own time

05:44.866 --> 05:46.520
and in their own way.

05:46.694 --> 05:47.738
Just as you did.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.349
What if they don't?

05:50.959 --> 05:53.004
What if Piper never sees
the future you promised?

05:53.178 --> 05:55.311
You must help her
to see it, Leo.

05:55.485 --> 05:58.227
You must gently
guide her to it.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.620
This is the burden

05:59.794 --> 06:02.013
that you took
upon becoming an Avatar.

06:02.187 --> 06:03.363
I'm not just an Avatar.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.234
I'm a husband

06:05.408 --> 06:06.583
and I'm a father.

06:07.845 --> 06:09.281
And I joined you
to get that back.

06:09.456 --> 06:10.674
And you will
get it back, Leo.

06:10.848 --> 06:13.329
You will,

06:13.503 --> 06:14.983
once we have ended

06:15.157 --> 06:18.116
this perpetual battle
between good and evil,

06:18.290 --> 06:22.817
once we have brought forth
a better way.

06:34.002 --> 06:38.615
PHOEBE:
Okay, it's almost dawn
and nothing is happening.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.182
Can we go home
and go to sleep now?

06:40.356 --> 06:43.315
Shh. Just
stay focused.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.753
PAIGE:
Right, focused.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.755
Maybe you drew
the pentagram wrong.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.410
I know how to draw a
pentagram. Thank you.

06:50.584 --> 06:52.194
Yeah, but did you
use a felt marker?

06:52.368 --> 06:54.544
'Cause maybe
the thickness of the tip

06:54.718 --> 06:57.025
led us astray a couple
of blocks, huh?

06:57.199 --> 06:58.374
We are not going home.

06:58.548 --> 06:59.854
What's the matter
with you guys?

07:00.028 --> 07:01.029
Do you want to save
an Innocent or not?

07:01.203 --> 07:04.162
Of course we do.
It's just, uh...

07:04.336 --> 07:06.469
What? It's just what?

07:07.862 --> 07:09.559
Now you're not
telling me something?

07:09.733 --> 07:11.300
Leo's what.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.389
What?We just think that

07:13.563 --> 07:15.957
you may have been
so eager to avoid Leo

07:16.131 --> 07:18.133
that you miscalculated
the demon attack.

07:18.307 --> 07:19.395
What she said.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.353
All right, fine.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.268
I admit it:
I may be avoiding Leo,

07:23.443 --> 07:25.183
but that does not mean
I am wrong about this.

07:25.357 --> 07:26.968
Why? Why are you
so upset with him?

07:27.142 --> 07:28.186
He's been...

07:28.360 --> 07:29.318
an angel lately.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.928
Yeah, well, that's the problem.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.540
He's been too perfect
even for him.

07:33.714 --> 07:36.325
And I just keep waiting
for the other shoe to drop.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.936
Why don't you just
talk to him about it?

07:39.110 --> 07:40.764
I have about a dozen times

07:40.938 --> 07:42.418
and he just thinks
I'm crazy or something,

07:42.592 --> 07:44.638
which is why I am channeling

07:44.812 --> 07:46.944
my frustration
into something useful.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.380
I just want
this demon

07:48.555 --> 07:50.426
to attack soon, so I can make

07:50.600 --> 07:52.123
my breakfast date with Kyle.

07:52.297 --> 07:53.908
Yeah, see breakfast
is not a date.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.475
Dinner's a date.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.694
Lunch is definitely
maybe a date.

07:57.868 --> 07:59.479
Breakfast is always
just breakfast.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.219
As long as he doesn't talk
about the Avatars,

08:01.393 --> 08:02.917
it can be breakfast,
lunch or dinner,

08:03.091 --> 08:04.919
and I will consider it a date.[cell phone rings]

08:06.094 --> 08:08.270
Who is calling you at this hour?

08:08.444 --> 08:09.663
[phone rings and beeps off]

08:09.837 --> 08:10.751
No one.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.274
Avoiding someone?

08:14.450 --> 08:16.104
Is that our Innocent?

08:17.453 --> 08:19.542
We're about to find out.
Get the dye.

08:21.457 --> 08:24.504
They have to become visible
to attack. Let's go.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.159
Who the hell are you?

08:28.333 --> 08:30.422
It won't matter.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.079
Hey!

08:36.994 --> 08:38.300
Ah!

08:39.170 --> 08:41.085
Kill them.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.046
Throw the dye.

Heads up, guys.
Heads up.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.578
[screams]

08:58.973 --> 09:00.409
Well, that didn't
go too well,

09:00.583 --> 09:02.150
they were a lot more
powerful than I thought.

09:02.324 --> 09:05.109
He's still alive.

09:05.283 --> 09:06.284
Okay, let's get him
to Magic School

09:06.458 --> 09:07.634
and we'll find out
who they are.

09:07.808 --> 09:08.852
And make more potions.

09:11.899 --> 09:13.988
The Innocent has been marked...

09:15.380 --> 09:17.861
the territory staked.

09:18.035 --> 09:21.038
Soon, every mortal
within the pentagram

09:21.212 --> 09:23.780
will be ours alone
to prey upon.

09:23.954 --> 09:25.913
But the Innocent lives.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.915
Our rivals...
Can no more
easily kill

09:28.089 --> 09:29.177
than we can.

09:31.527 --> 09:33.747
Now that the Charmed Ones
are protecting him.

09:33.921 --> 09:36.184
Then how is
the territory staked?

09:36.358 --> 09:37.968
As long as he lives,
the Sokols could still

09:38.142 --> 09:39.317
try to claim it for themselves.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.885
And we want them to try.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.670
Or at least make it
look like they did.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.674
Witches don't know
who we are, right?

09:47.848 --> 09:49.153
Right.

09:49.327 --> 09:52.026
So we put them
on our rivals' trail...

09:52.200 --> 09:55.682
by making them think
the Sokols attacked them.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.473
Excuse me.
Here you are.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.782
Thank you.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.480
So, this place is great.

10:11.654 --> 10:12.873
Yeah? Are you sure?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.614
I mean, you
like the place?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.616
Well, I've never
had breakfast here,

10:16.790 --> 10:19.967
but I'm-- I'm sure
it's terrific. Yeah.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.405
I guess I should have asked you
out to dinner, huh?

10:23.579 --> 10:26.103
It's fine. I'm up
this early anyway.

10:26.277 --> 10:27.975
Well, you know,
I figured since we got

10:28.149 --> 10:29.846
the first kiss out
of the way and everything.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.848
Out of the way?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.241
Sorry.

10:33.415 --> 10:35.417
I didn't mean that.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.592
I did not mean that.

10:36.766 --> 10:38.159
I just... you know, I'm rusty.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.856
All Avatars, all the time?

10:40.030 --> 10:42.380
Yeah, something like that.

10:42.554 --> 10:44.600
It's just that I've been chasing
them for so long, you know.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.950
It hasn't... it hasn't left
much time for a social life.

10:47.124 --> 10:49.083
Well, maybe it's time

10:49.257 --> 10:50.432
you start changing that,
don't you think?

10:50.606 --> 10:52.739
Yes, I think.

10:55.524 --> 10:56.743
It's just that
they're so close, Paige.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.048
I mean, I know it.

10:58.222 --> 10:59.267
You know,
I can feel it...Eh!

11:00.181 --> 11:01.138
You promised.

11:01.312 --> 11:03.010
You're right.

11:03.184 --> 11:04.185
You're right. That's it.

11:04.359 --> 11:07.144
No more Avatar talk. I swear.

11:08.145 --> 11:09.973
[cell phone rings]

11:16.371 --> 11:18.634
Hmm?

11:18.808 --> 11:19.853
[sighs]

11:20.027 --> 11:22.116
Good. That's a
good start.

11:24.727 --> 11:25.685
What?

11:26.816 --> 11:28.818
It's, uh... it's vibrating.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.428
It just tickles a little bit,
that's all.

11:30.602 --> 11:31.734
[clears throat][phone beeps]

11:31.908 --> 11:33.910
It's off.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.042
I promise.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.565
No more distractions.

11:36.739 --> 11:37.566
[clears throat]

11:37.740 --> 11:39.481
[cell phone rings]

11:39.655 --> 11:41.439
That's my emergency line.

11:41.613 --> 11:42.571
I gotta take this.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.747
Sorry.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.183
Brody.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.099
What?

11:49.273 --> 11:50.666
All right,
as soon

11:50.840 --> 11:52.233
as you get those numbers,
you call me, all right?

11:55.149 --> 11:58.761
Intel just detected another
unusual power spike in the area.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
Paige,

12:00.458 --> 12:03.679
this could mean some
serious Avatar activity,

12:03.853 --> 12:05.333
What... don't you know
what this means?

12:05.507 --> 12:07.770
Yeah, yeah, I do.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.077
It means that you eat alone.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.861
I'm sorry.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.909
Paige, come on.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.782
Uh...

12:19.956 --> 12:21.436
Idiot.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.789
Yeah, the good thing
about getting up so early

12:26.963 --> 12:28.312
is how much you
can get done.

12:28.486 --> 12:30.314
I mean, already today,
I've made demon dye,

12:30.488 --> 12:32.795
I've saved an Innocent,
I emailed in my column.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.971
[laughing]:
Plucked my eyebrows.

12:35.145 --> 12:37.147
If it wasn't for sleep
deprivation, I would be okay.

12:37.321 --> 12:38.366
What about the demons?

12:38.540 --> 12:39.889
Yeah, I couldn't
find anything

12:40.063 --> 12:41.848
in The Bookto
help identify them,

12:42.022 --> 12:44.154
but I did get to read up
on the family history.

12:44.328 --> 12:45.895
Did you know that
Beatrice Warren

12:46.069 --> 12:47.462
only had one leg?

12:47.636 --> 12:48.942
What's this?

12:49.116 --> 12:50.117
You're making
spaghetti sauce?

12:50.291 --> 12:52.075
No, that's, uh, demon blood.

12:53.642 --> 12:54.948
I got it
from the salvage yard.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.776
I was gonna use it
to scry for them

12:56.950 --> 12:58.821
after I make
the vanquishing potion.

12:58.995 --> 13:01.955
Wow, jacklebeet.

13:02.129 --> 13:06.263
So, exactly which state are you
trying to blow off the map?

13:06.437 --> 13:07.569
I don't want
to take any chances.

13:07.743 --> 13:08.918
We need two kitchens.

13:09.092 --> 13:11.181
Do you know
where the beetle toe is?

13:11.355 --> 13:12.574
I think it's up in the attic.

13:14.619 --> 13:15.882
Boy, when you're
avoiding something,

13:16.056 --> 13:17.797
you really do a number,
don't you?

13:17.971 --> 13:21.278
I seem to remember someone
doing some avoiding

13:21.452 --> 13:23.237
a little while back.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.457
Yeah, if you're talking about
Leslie, you're absolutely right.

13:26.631 --> 13:28.198
But my big sister
gave me some advice

13:28.372 --> 13:29.591
that I'm gonna give back to you.

13:29.765 --> 13:31.288
Stop dodging.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.942
Just talk to Leo.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.466
On the subject of dodging,
who called this morning?

13:37.120 --> 13:38.730
Yeah, see, your
"I'm covering something" look

13:38.905 --> 13:40.602
hasn't worked

13:40.776 --> 13:42.734
since the sixth grade,
so spill.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.606
Okay, but you can't tell Paige

13:44.780 --> 13:46.434
'cause I don't want her
to get all paranoid.

13:46.608 --> 13:48.044
Why would she get all paranoid?

13:48.218 --> 13:50.220
Darryl actually thinks Brody

13:50.394 --> 13:52.396
had something to do
with Sheridan's disappearance.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.876
[sighs quietly]

13:54.050 --> 13:55.008
Yeah, that's why I'm keeping it
low-key.

13:55.182 --> 13:56.836
Darryl's on his way over.

13:57.010 --> 13:58.272
We're gonna talk about it
while Paige is on her date.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.839
Oh, he's talking to us again?

14:00.013 --> 14:01.753
Kind of.

14:01.928 --> 14:02.885
Baby steps.

14:04.104 --> 14:05.453
[orbing]

14:06.497 --> 14:07.847
Hi.

14:08.021 --> 14:09.022
Hi.

14:11.285 --> 14:13.940
I'll be in the attic.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.596
Well, go talk to her, would you?

14:18.770 --> 14:20.729
Hurry up, go.Right.

14:20.903 --> 14:24.124
[doorbell rings]

14:28.650 --> 14:29.781
Hey.
Hey.

14:29.956 --> 14:31.174
Is this a good
time to talk?

14:31.348 --> 14:32.306
Well, actually, yeah.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.264
Paige is out on a date.

14:34.438 --> 14:36.005
What'd you find out?
Nothing.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.702
Nothing?

14:37.877 --> 14:39.356
Okay, well,
nothing is good, right?

14:39.530 --> 14:42.490
No, I mean I can't
find anything.

14:42.664 --> 14:43.578
It's like Sheridan's
disappeared

14:43.752 --> 14:44.796
off the face of the earth.

14:44.971 --> 14:46.276
What are you saying?

14:46.450 --> 14:47.974
I think that maybe
Brody did something

14:48.148 --> 14:51.238
to make Sheridan
disappear.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.630
Something bad maybe.

14:52.804 --> 14:54.458
No, I don't believe that.

14:54.632 --> 14:56.156
That's because you don't want
to believe that.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.158
Brody may have
saved your butts.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.334
I get that.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.989
But if he did something
to hurt Sheridan...

15:03.163 --> 15:04.555
Wrong is wrong.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.688
Okay, well, maybe I can get
a premonition

15:06.862 --> 15:07.732
and see where she is.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.820
No.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.431
No magic.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.128
[scoffs]I told you.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.651
I've done some soul-searching.

15:13.825 --> 15:15.175
I want to help again,

15:15.349 --> 15:16.480
but I don't want to
go there anymore.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.526
Darryl, you gotta get over this.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.049
I mean, really.

15:20.223 --> 15:22.051
One bad experience with magic

15:22.225 --> 15:24.967
can't outweigh six years
of good, can it?

15:25.141 --> 15:26.229
[door opens]

15:26.403 --> 15:27.796
Hey.
Hey.

15:27.970 --> 15:29.145
Hi, Paige.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.060
Hey, Darryl.

15:31.234 --> 15:33.541
I thought you were on your date.PAIGE:
Yeah, so did I.

15:33.715 --> 15:34.977
DARRYL:
Look, um,

15:35.151 --> 15:36.892
tell Piper I said
hello, okay?

15:38.285 --> 15:39.590
Take care.

15:39.764 --> 15:40.940
Take care.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.076
We're friends again?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.644
Yeah... weird.

15:49.818 --> 15:51.776
Bygones.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.604
[sighs]

15:54.954 --> 15:56.085
Leo,

15:56.259 --> 15:58.044
please, this is not
the time or place.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.784
I just want my
family back, Piper.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.177
I just want you back.

16:01.351 --> 16:02.874
I don't want to talk
about this right now.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.354
Why not?

16:04.528 --> 16:05.965
Because this is
a little dicey here, okay?

16:06.139 --> 16:07.618
I know that
and that's why we need to talk.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.403
No, not that... this.

16:09.577 --> 16:12.406
If I make one mistake, I can
blow up the entire house, okay,

16:12.580 --> 16:14.234
so this is a bad time.

16:14.408 --> 16:16.497
I just wish you'd trust me.

16:16.671 --> 16:19.326
Yeah, well, maybe you should
try telling me the truth.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.197
This is so frustrating.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.772
This can't
keep happening, Leo.

16:30.946 --> 16:33.122
We've had this
conversation.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.602
I can't help it.

16:34.776 --> 16:35.864
I can't keep doing this.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.257
You must keep
up pretenses.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.475
There's no other way.

16:38.649 --> 16:39.563
There is another way.

16:39.737 --> 16:40.956
I could tell her the truth.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.088
Leo...
You don't understand.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.828
I know Piper.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.787
She doesn't want to live
like this any more than I do.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.571
She hates hunting demons
all the time.

16:47.745 --> 16:49.138
She wants nothing but the best

16:49.312 --> 16:52.533
for herself, for her family,
for all of us.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.448
She can handle the truth;
I know she can.

16:54.622 --> 16:55.579
But if she can't...

16:55.753 --> 16:56.754
If she's not open

16:56.928 --> 16:59.409
to our way,

16:59.583 --> 17:01.629
it would risk everything
we hope to achieve,

17:01.803 --> 17:03.370
everything we covet...

17:03.544 --> 17:06.634
And cause her to lose
perspective in the process,

17:06.808 --> 17:08.288
ignore what shouldn't
be ignored.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.290
Which would put her
at risk as well.

17:10.464 --> 17:13.206
There's too much
at stake, Leo.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.077
She can handle it.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.434
He needs to see for himself.

17:24.608 --> 17:25.914
But what of the risk?

17:26.088 --> 17:28.177
It's no greater
than that of him

17:28.351 --> 17:30.745
tapping into
the collective

17:30.919 --> 17:32.051
without intending to.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.748
Very well.

17:33.922 --> 17:37.186
But if anything goes wrong,
everything may be lost.

17:37.360 --> 17:38.970
Our powers are not
inexhaustible.

17:46.587 --> 17:47.936
What is the matter?

17:48.110 --> 17:50.591
I, uh...

17:50.765 --> 17:51.983
I need to tell
you something.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.116
I'm listening.

17:56.379 --> 17:57.859
Well, the reason I know

17:58.033 --> 18:00.818
the demons aren't working
with the Avatars...

18:00.992 --> 18:03.343
is because I'm an Avatar.

18:03.517 --> 18:05.388
[laughs]:
What?

18:08.435 --> 18:09.871
Oh, my God.

18:10.045 --> 18:12.482
[screams]

18:15.268 --> 18:17.008
Piper.

18:17.183 --> 18:19.533
No! You stay away from me.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.327
PHOEBE:
What happened?

18:31.501 --> 18:32.676
Let me help.Don't.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.417
Piper, please.

18:34.591 --> 18:36.289
Could someone please just
tell us what happened?

18:36.463 --> 18:40.075
The potion blew up and,
uh, Leo's an Avatar.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.729
What?

18:41.903 --> 18:43.339
What?

18:43.513 --> 18:45.167
Oh, you know, the gathering
storm, looming threat.

18:45.341 --> 18:47.082
That would be Leo.

18:47.256 --> 18:49.128
We're not a threat; we're trying
to save the world from itself.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.259
PHOEBE:
Wait.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.696
Did he just say "we"?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.263
I think he just said "we."

18:54.437 --> 18:55.830
You know, you wanted the truth
and I told you.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.136
They said you had
to come to it on your own.

18:57.310 --> 18:58.137
I said you could handle it.

18:58.311 --> 18:59.834
Handle what?

19:00.008 --> 19:01.531
That you're what everybody
is afraid of? Even the Elders?

19:01.705 --> 19:03.359
They're afraid
because they don't understand.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.144
They can't understand.

19:05.318 --> 19:06.841
The Avatars
are beyond good and evil.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.059
They're everything we've been
searching for,

19:08.234 --> 19:09.409
a life without demons.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.459
Okay, he's cracked.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.287
Absolutely.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.941
No, I have never been more clear
about anything in my life.

19:20.115 --> 19:21.725
Piper, I beg you not
to be closed to this.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.074
It's everything we've
been searching for,

19:23.249 --> 19:25.164
everything we wanted, I promise.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.949
I think you need to take
the boys to Magic School.

19:28.123 --> 19:30.778
But...Please, I need time
to think about all of this.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.520
Are you sure you can trust him?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.609
I can trust my husband
with our children.

19:35.783 --> 19:36.958
Now, please go.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.575
Do you think
he's telling the truth?

19:45.749 --> 19:49.144
It would be a really stupid lie
if he wasn't, don't you think?

19:51.102 --> 19:52.495
Sorry.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.410
It's okay.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.978
What are you
gonna do?

19:57.152 --> 20:00.199
I don't know, but we have
a demon to vanquish first

20:00.373 --> 20:01.765
and an Innocent
to protect, so...

20:01.939 --> 20:03.245
Yeah, but...

20:03.419 --> 20:04.551
Look, just re-make
the potion for me

20:04.725 --> 20:06.596
and I'll go get cleaned up
and...

20:06.770 --> 20:08.642
Be careful of the beetle toe.

20:11.732 --> 20:12.820
Okay, we have
bigger things

20:12.994 --> 20:14.648
to worry about
than potions.

20:14.822 --> 20:15.823
I agree.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.477
We have to save Leo.

20:17.651 --> 20:20.436
You know, we're gonna have
to ask for Kyle's help.

20:32.492 --> 20:33.319
Now what?

20:33.493 --> 20:35.582
Put them on.
Why?

20:35.756 --> 20:39.325
Because we're going to attack
the Charmed Ones next.

20:39.499 --> 20:40.500
Malvoc, that's suicide.

20:40.674 --> 20:42.763
Only if we die.

20:42.937 --> 20:44.417
But I only plan
to fight long enough

20:44.591 --> 20:47.115
for them to identify us...
as Sokols.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.813
Then our enemies
become their enemies.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.859
Fine, they'll vanquish them,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.340
but others will still come to
challenge us for the territory.

20:54.514 --> 20:56.385
They won't be able to
after we kill the Innocent.

20:56.559 --> 21:01.303
Those ancient rules
are etched in... brimstone.

21:01.477 --> 21:03.958
And after they vanquish
our rivals,

21:04.132 --> 21:06.439
they'll think the threat
to the Innocent has passed.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.354
And then return him.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.273
We'll need more of these.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.191
Something's happened, Leo.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.932
Look, I don't have time for
this; I have to get back to...

21:22.106 --> 21:23.412
We've detected
a power surge,

21:23.586 --> 21:24.761
a time shift.

21:24.935 --> 21:26.459
That could only
mean one thing.

21:26.633 --> 21:28.112
The Avatars are
making their move.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.766
How do you know
it's them?

21:29.940 --> 21:31.594
Because no demon has
this kind of power.

21:31.768 --> 21:32.813
Not since the Source.

21:32.987 --> 21:34.293
So...

21:34.467 --> 21:35.903
[scoffs]:
what do you want from me?

21:36.077 --> 21:38.166
We want you to alert
the Charmed Ones.

21:38.340 --> 21:41.343
We expect that the
Avatars will be coming
after them first.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.129
What is it?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.609
Nothing.
I just don't know

21:46.783 --> 21:47.958
how much we know about 'em,
that's all.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.090
We know they're a threat.

21:49.264 --> 21:50.700
Why, because they have power?

21:50.874 --> 21:53.094
Yes, the kind of power
that, in the wrong hands,

21:53.268 --> 21:54.487
could be a danger to us all.

21:54.661 --> 21:56.097
Okay, so are we a threat?

21:57.707 --> 21:58.534
I'm sorry.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.666
Elders.

21:59.840 --> 22:00.971
I mean, we have a great power,

22:01.145 --> 22:02.495
but we're only a threat
to demons.

22:02.669 --> 22:04.192
And your point is?

22:04.366 --> 22:05.846
My point is:
is that we don't know enough

22:06.020 --> 22:07.326
about them to fear them.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.458
How do we know they're not
a benevolent power?

22:09.632 --> 22:11.634
I mean, who are we to judge them
before even meeting them?

22:11.808 --> 22:13.680
If they were benevolent,
they wouldn't lurk,

22:13.854 --> 22:15.421
insidiously
waiting to make their move.

22:15.595 --> 22:16.726
They would show themselves.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.209
This is no time
to lose your faith

22:21.383 --> 22:23.385
in all that
we're about, Leo.

22:23.559 --> 22:26.606
Despite all that's
happened in the past,

22:26.780 --> 22:29.043
we need you
on our side.

22:34.178 --> 22:37.573
[exhales]

22:47.931 --> 22:49.106
Have you seen
Phoebe and Paige?

22:49.280 --> 22:51.326
Aren't they upstairs
making potions?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.936
No.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.068
How are the boys?

22:54.242 --> 22:56.418
They're fine.

22:56.592 --> 22:57.854
Miss Donovan's with them.

22:58.028 --> 22:59.465
And the Innocent?

22:59.639 --> 23:00.944
Sleeping.

23:01.118 --> 23:02.816
Still under the effects
of the potions.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.733
How are you?

23:06.907 --> 23:08.125
How am I?

23:08.299 --> 23:09.126
I mean, with all this.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.390
I don't know.

23:11.564 --> 23:12.695
I have questions.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.915
Well, you can ask me.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.003
I can answer them now.

23:16.177 --> 23:18.571
What are they exactly?

23:18.745 --> 23:21.008
Or should I say,
what are you exactly?

23:21.182 --> 23:24.794
I'm the same man
you married, Piper.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.840
Someone who wants nothing
but the best for his family.

23:27.014 --> 23:30.234
And the Avatars are
gonna give us that how?

23:30.409 --> 23:32.454
By using their powers.

23:32.628 --> 23:35.239
Our powers, to change
what has always been.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.024
To remake what is.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.418
That sounds like a load of crap.

23:39.592 --> 23:40.723
I know it does, but it's not.

23:40.897 --> 23:42.551
You know, for all we know,

23:42.725 --> 23:44.379
they're exactly like everything
else we've been fighting.

23:44.553 --> 23:45.728
They want to end everything
we've been fighting against,

23:45.902 --> 23:46.729
put an end to the struggle

23:46.903 --> 23:48.165
once and for all.

23:48.339 --> 23:49.558
That's impossible.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.125
I know, I used to think
it was, too.

23:51.299 --> 23:52.866
But now I know
it's not.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.389
They want to make the world
better for everybody.

23:54.563 --> 23:56.652
And those floating heads
that tormented you,

23:56.826 --> 23:58.132
they made your life better?

23:58.306 --> 24:01.135
That was just a way to...

24:01.309 --> 24:03.180
get my attention.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.747
Make me open to a new idea.

24:04.921 --> 24:05.879
Leo...

24:06.053 --> 24:06.923
Piper,

24:07.097 --> 24:07.837
think about it.

24:08.795 --> 24:10.623
A demon-free world.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.363
It's everything
we always dreamed about.

24:14.061 --> 24:15.845
Don't you think we should
at least consider that,

24:16.019 --> 24:17.194
after everything
we've been through?

24:23.723 --> 24:24.332
[grunts]

24:26.769 --> 24:27.378
[grunts]

24:30.599 --> 24:32.340
[screams]

24:33.994 --> 24:35.517
[screams]

24:39.042 --> 24:40.435
[panting]

24:41.523 --> 24:43.569
It's just a graze.

24:43.743 --> 24:45.440
Oh!

24:45.614 --> 24:46.659
[panting]

24:48.095 --> 24:49.749
[screams]

25:04.546 --> 25:07.331
They really want that Innocent.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.855
I just wish I knew why.

25:09.029 --> 25:09.986
There'll be more of them.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.513
Yeah, well, at least
we have a way to find them now.

25:14.687 --> 25:15.775
I don't mean

25:15.949 --> 25:17.472
just them, Piper,
I mean demons.

25:17.646 --> 25:19.779
And they'll just keep
coming back over and over,

25:19.953 --> 25:21.171
just like they always have,

25:21.345 --> 25:22.999
unless we let
the Avatars stop it.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.261
Forever.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.225
Oh, Paige! I was, uh...

25:31.399 --> 25:33.096
Hey.

25:33.270 --> 25:34.184
Okay.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.316
I'm sorry about breakfast.

25:35.490 --> 25:36.404
Okay, I didn't handle it well.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.623
And-and, look,

25:37.797 --> 25:39.407
I know what you're gonna say.

25:39.581 --> 25:40.800
I'm obsessed about
the Avatars, I know...

25:40.974 --> 25:42.541
That's not it,
it's just that...

25:42.715 --> 25:44.194
It's not gonna happen again.

25:44.368 --> 25:45.979
All right? I promise.

25:46.153 --> 25:47.502
It's not that--
Leo's an Avatar!

25:47.676 --> 25:49.635
He told us
this morning.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.898
What?

25:52.072 --> 25:52.942
How?

25:53.116 --> 25:54.509
We don't know.

25:54.683 --> 25:56.598
He-he didn't say, he just
kind of dropped the bomb

25:56.772 --> 25:58.034
on us this morning.

25:58.208 --> 25:59.514
We don't know
exactly what it means.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.866
Where are you going?

26:06.042 --> 26:07.217
Parking sucks in this city.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.523
How's he taking it?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.749
[cell phone ringing]

26:16.923 --> 26:17.880
Hello?

26:18.054 --> 26:18.881
DARRYL:
Hey, it's Darryl.

26:19.055 --> 26:20.491
I'm stumped.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.232
Maybe you could use a little

26:22.406 --> 26:24.626
hocus pocus to find out
what Brody did with Sheridan.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.672
Okay, uh, but now's
not really a good time.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.717
So can I call you back
in a little bit?

26:28.891 --> 26:30.371
All right, bye.

26:32.416 --> 26:34.549
PAIGE:
What are you
looking for?

26:34.723 --> 26:36.682
This.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.248
Does he know
where the others are?

26:38.422 --> 26:39.249
Others who?

26:39.423 --> 26:40.468
The other Avatars!

26:41.600 --> 26:43.427
No, he didn't say.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.472
Why?

26:44.646 --> 26:47.040
What is that?

26:47.214 --> 26:48.563
It's a potion.

26:48.737 --> 26:49.956
For what?

26:51.871 --> 26:53.046
For killing Avatars.

27:02.359 --> 27:03.447
Where is he?

27:03.622 --> 27:04.710
Kyle, would you
stop please?

27:04.884 --> 27:06.886
We're not gonna
let you kill Leo.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.583
You don't understand.

27:08.757 --> 27:10.367
He's an Avatar now.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.978
PAIGE:
No, he's actually
our brother-in-law.

27:12.152 --> 27:14.154
How can you be so sure
the potion's even gonna work?

27:14.328 --> 27:15.938
Because they killed my parents
over it, that's why.

27:16.112 --> 27:17.461
One potion, that's all you have.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.898
You cannot get even
with them all.

27:19.072 --> 27:20.116
The hell I can't.

27:20.290 --> 27:21.988
Their powers are
all tied together.

27:22.162 --> 27:23.772
You kill one of them,
it weakens them all.

27:23.946 --> 27:24.991
They become vulnerable.

27:25.165 --> 27:26.209
PAIGE:
This is ridiculous!

27:26.383 --> 27:27.602
Leo did not kill
your parents.

27:27.776 --> 27:29.082
If he's one of them, he did.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.475
He just became one of them.

27:31.650 --> 27:33.608
Look, we didn't come to you
so you can kill Leo.

27:33.782 --> 27:35.784
We came to you to help us
get rid of them.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.657
Thisis the only way
to get rid of them.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.660
When my parents uncovered this,

27:41.834 --> 27:43.487
they didn't just discover
a potion, they discovered

27:43.662 --> 27:45.664
a battle that happened 5,000
years ago over our very future.

27:46.926 --> 27:48.318
They fought the Avatars then.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.016
And we got to fight them now.

27:54.585 --> 27:56.196
What happened in here?

27:57.371 --> 27:58.459
Piper?

27:58.633 --> 27:59.547
PIPER:
Upstairs.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.288
At least we know
she's okay.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.072
Well, looks like the
demons didn't wait

28:03.246 --> 28:05.118
for us to go after them,
they came here first.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.294
How do you know the Avatars
didn't do it, huh?

28:07.468 --> 28:09.252
You know, he'll
kill you first.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.167
You won't even be able to get
that bottle out of your hand.

28:11.341 --> 28:13.082
We'll see.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.389
Look, I get that this is about
your parents. I do, really.

28:15.563 --> 28:17.304
Yes, it is about my parents,
and, no, you don't get it.

28:17.478 --> 28:18.871
The hell I don't.

28:19.045 --> 28:20.568
My parents were
killed, too, remember?

28:20.742 --> 28:22.788
Paige, my parents were murdered.

28:22.962 --> 28:26.443
Look, Leo is not
the bad guy here.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.315
For all we know,
he was brainwashed

28:28.489 --> 28:29.316
or possessed or something.

28:29.490 --> 28:31.448
Just, please,

28:31.622 --> 28:33.755
give us a minute,
just wait down here.

28:36.889 --> 28:38.151
Please?

28:38.325 --> 28:40.457
Just don't let him go,
all right?

28:42.024 --> 28:43.330
I spent 20 years
looking for the Avatars,

28:43.504 --> 28:44.723
I'm not about to lose them now.

28:50.598 --> 28:51.991
Piper, what happened?

28:52.165 --> 28:53.035
Are you okay?

28:53.209 --> 28:54.558
No thanks to you.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.256
What is that
supposed to mean?

28:56.430 --> 28:58.127
What it means is
it would have been nice

28:58.301 --> 29:00.216
to have a vanquishing potion
when we were ambushed--

29:00.390 --> 29:01.652
a vanquishing potion
that you were

29:01.827 --> 29:03.089
supposed to make,
by the way.

29:03.263 --> 29:04.264
Oops.Yeah, oops.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.526
Were the hell were you?

29:05.700 --> 29:06.919
I was at Kyle's.

29:07.093 --> 29:08.747
What were you
doing there?

29:08.921 --> 29:09.748
Frankly, trying
to save you.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.749
Trying to save me?

29:10.923 --> 29:12.011
I don't need saving.

29:12.185 --> 29:13.839
I know what I'm doing.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.101
Do you know Kyle's parents
were killed by the Avatars?

29:15.275 --> 29:16.842
That's impossible.

29:17.016 --> 29:18.539
It goes against everything
they believe in.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.236
PHOEBE:
Well, you're gonna
have to come up with

29:20.410 --> 29:22.412
a better argument than
that if you go downstairs.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.762
Why is that?

29:23.936 --> 29:25.285
He's downstairs?

29:25.459 --> 29:26.677
Why is he downstairs?

29:26.852 --> 29:27.766
You don't want to know.

29:29.115 --> 29:30.029
He thinks you're
a threat, Leo,

29:30.203 --> 29:31.204
to all of us.

29:31.378 --> 29:32.205
Well, he's wrong.

29:32.379 --> 29:33.206
How do you know?

29:33.380 --> 29:34.773
Because!

29:34.947 --> 29:36.426
Look, I know this is
a shock to everyone,

29:36.600 --> 29:38.428
but he didn't have
to tell us the truth.

29:38.602 --> 29:40.561
He wouldn't have,
if it was a bad thing.

29:40.735 --> 29:42.781
Piper, everything,
and I mean everything,

29:42.955 --> 29:44.173
points to them
being bad.

29:44.347 --> 29:45.392
Even the Elders
think so.

29:45.566 --> 29:47.263
Because they
don't understand.

29:47.437 --> 29:49.396
So, what, we're just supposed
to take your word for it?

29:49.570 --> 29:50.963
How do we know

29:51.137 --> 29:52.138
you're not possessed
or something right now?

29:52.312 --> 29:53.574
[chuckles]:
Come on.

29:53.748 --> 29:54.618
No, Leo, I'm serious!

29:54.793 --> 29:55.706
How do we know?

29:55.881 --> 29:57.317
Because they haven't threatened

29:57.491 --> 29:58.492
anything we believe in.

29:59.449 --> 30:00.711
It's all good.

30:02.278 --> 30:03.714
We at least need
to think about it.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.761
Since when did you
jump on this Avatar train?

30:06.935 --> 30:08.154
When I started thinking about

30:08.328 --> 30:09.982
what my kids' lives
would be like

30:10.156 --> 30:12.419
fighting the battles we've been
fighting our entire lives.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.595
But it's what we do,
it's what we were born to do.

30:14.769 --> 30:16.858
That does not mean
we have to die doing it.

30:17.032 --> 30:18.468
PAIGE:
Yeah, maybe you should try

30:18.642 --> 30:19.774
to talk to Kyle,
hear his side of the story.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.036
I don't need to.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.082
I need to vanquish demons again.

30:27.260 --> 30:29.305
Now what?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.789
How is it you're the only one
who still lives?

30:34.963 --> 30:36.008
I wasn't with them.

30:36.182 --> 30:37.444
I swear!

30:37.618 --> 30:39.098
I don't know what
happened to them!

30:43.058 --> 30:44.277
[gagging]

30:45.582 --> 30:46.627
[screams]

30:46.801 --> 30:48.977
Something... is not right!

30:49.151 --> 30:51.153
Why would Malvoc
attack only to retreat?

30:51.327 --> 30:53.112
How would that help him
get to the Innocent?

30:54.156 --> 30:55.201
Lose something?

30:58.204 --> 30:58.944
[screaming]

30:59.901 --> 31:01.642
[screaming]

31:06.865 --> 31:09.563
What was that?

31:09.737 --> 31:11.870
All part of the package.

31:12.044 --> 31:14.611
That was a
lot of power.

31:14.785 --> 31:18.093
Yeah, but it's used wisely.

31:18.267 --> 31:19.703
See, the Avatars
could destroy us

31:19.878 --> 31:22.793
or force us to change,
but they don't.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.883
Isn't that enough
reason to trust them?

31:28.408 --> 31:30.062
How could you let them go?

31:30.236 --> 31:31.585
How could you let
the Avatar go?

31:31.759 --> 31:33.500
Okay, he's
still Leo.

31:33.674 --> 31:35.894
So would you stop referring to
him as "the Avatar," please?

31:36.068 --> 31:38.070
All right, we got to fix this,
and we got to fix it fast.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.375
Now, where did he go?

31:39.549 --> 31:41.203
I don't know.
He orbed out with Piper.

31:41.377 --> 31:42.813
But how do you know he didn't
go to alert the others?!

31:42.988 --> 31:43.771
How are we supposed
to stop them?

31:43.945 --> 31:45.251
He didn't, I promise.

31:45.425 --> 31:47.079
How do you know? Huh?
How can you be so sure?

31:47.253 --> 31:48.950
I cannot believe you guys
let him get away!

31:51.083 --> 31:53.172
Okay, something
is wrong.

31:53.346 --> 31:54.738
He's not acting
like himself.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.436
I think you need to orb
that potion away from him

31:56.610 --> 31:57.524
before he does
something stupid.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.047
What if he flips out?

31:59.221 --> 32:00.309
I think he already has
flipped out...[grunts]

32:05.010 --> 32:06.054
What did you do?!

32:06.228 --> 32:09.188
It's just a tranq.

32:09.362 --> 32:11.103
She'll be fine.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.713
What are you doing?

32:12.887 --> 32:15.803
I'm killing an Avatar.

32:15.977 --> 32:19.546
And nobody's gonna stop me.

32:25.595 --> 32:28.250
He should wake up
in a couple minutes.

32:28.424 --> 32:29.730
Thanks, Piper.

32:29.904 --> 32:30.861
For?

32:31.036 --> 32:32.515
For believing in me.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.257
I always have.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.346
I always will,
it's the only way...

32:37.520 --> 32:38.521
I know.

32:38.695 --> 32:39.827
[moans softly]

32:42.656 --> 32:43.744
[screams]

32:48.314 --> 32:50.446
Thanks for helping.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.534
What just happened?

32:51.708 --> 32:52.535
We vanquished them.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.536
No, we didn't.

32:53.710 --> 32:55.408
Yeah, we did.

32:55.582 --> 32:56.452
No, we vanquished the wrong
ones. He had different markings.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.454
Wha... what do you mean?

32:58.628 --> 33:01.022
We were tricked.

33:01.196 --> 33:04.417
Yeah, well, we wouldn't
have been if Paige and Phoebe

33:04.591 --> 33:07.333
weren't off chasing Avatars
instead of helping me.

33:13.687 --> 33:14.775
Paige.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.734
She's fine.

33:18.953 --> 33:20.433
You are I are going to
have a little chat.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.919
All right, let's just
take a deep breath here,

33:29.094 --> 33:30.269
we can talk this out.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.444
Uh-uh.
Leo.

33:31.618 --> 33:32.706
I don't want
to hurt her,

33:32.880 --> 33:34.360
but I will
if I have to.

33:34.534 --> 33:35.752
Your kind is
responsible

33:35.926 --> 33:38.016
for a nightmare that
won't go away.

33:38.190 --> 33:39.887
For all those nights

33:40.061 --> 33:41.671
waking up in a sweat begging

33:41.845 --> 33:43.586
that the flashbacks
were just a dream.

33:43.760 --> 33:44.979
Kyle, please.

33:45.153 --> 33:46.633
It's not a dream though,
is it, Leo?

33:46.807 --> 33:48.591
You Avatars

33:48.765 --> 33:51.507
are as real as the air that
we breathe and just as vacant.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.596
My parents were viciously
murdered by them.

33:53.770 --> 33:57.252
So if I were you, Leo,
I'd do what I say.

33:57.426 --> 33:58.688
The Avatars

33:58.862 --> 33:59.950
couldn't have killed
your parents, Kyle.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.996
They believe in peace.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.432
I'm going to give
you three seconds

34:03.606 --> 34:04.520
to summon one of
your buddies here,

34:04.694 --> 34:05.652
so I can kill him.

34:06.783 --> 34:07.610
If you don't,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.047
I'm going to kill you.

34:10.309 --> 34:11.788
I can't do that.One...

34:11.962 --> 34:13.181
Avatars aren't the enemy, Kyle.

34:13.355 --> 34:14.574
Two...Leo.

34:14.748 --> 34:15.488
Three.No!

34:35.247 --> 34:37.379
Oh. Leo.

34:37.553 --> 34:39.294
Piper.

34:39.468 --> 34:40.904
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.212
No, it's okay. It's okay.

34:44.386 --> 34:46.171
Oh, God, no.

34:46.345 --> 34:48.260
Not now, please.

34:54.657 --> 34:58.052
Leo. Leo, come on.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.240
I don't understand,
how did this happen?

35:12.414 --> 35:14.590
The potion is real, Leo.

35:16.940 --> 35:19.987
It kills Avatars.

35:21.380 --> 35:22.685
The collective weakens

35:22.859 --> 35:24.774
with every last breath you take.

35:25.906 --> 35:27.690
We told you,

35:27.864 --> 35:30.867
the truth must come to them
in their own time, not yours.

35:31.041 --> 35:32.260
Yeah, but Piper, she...

35:32.434 --> 35:34.654
Understood... yes.

35:35.829 --> 35:38.614
But the others were not able to.

35:38.788 --> 35:41.487
And so we became the enemy.

35:41.661 --> 35:45.099
Out of fear, and ignorance.

35:45.273 --> 35:47.797
And an Innocent was lost
because of it.

35:47.971 --> 35:50.322
Everything was lost.I was

35:50.496 --> 35:51.714
just trying to make things
right with Piper.

35:51.888 --> 35:53.281
Of course.

35:53.455 --> 35:55.153
But you've learned...

35:55.327 --> 35:57.285
and now you can
save yourself.

35:57.459 --> 36:00.114
You have it in you
to rewind time

36:00.288 --> 36:02.464
to just before
you told Piper the truth.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.683
If you hurry.

36:03.857 --> 36:05.554
If we all hurry.

36:25.008 --> 36:27.272
It worked.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.535
Yes.

36:29.709 --> 36:31.624
But at a price.

36:31.798 --> 36:36.498
All that's happened has taken
a great toll on our power.

36:36.672 --> 36:37.673
As it is,

36:37.847 --> 36:38.892
we may not have enough

36:39.066 --> 36:40.198
to implement our plan.

36:40.372 --> 36:42.896
BETA:
To rid the world
of demons...

36:43.070 --> 36:45.159
to end the duality
requires all that we had.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.769
But if the sisters
come to the truth,

36:46.943 --> 36:48.162
won't their powers
add to the collective?

36:48.336 --> 36:49.642
Yes.

36:49.816 --> 36:52.035
But it may not be enough.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.951
You must not try
this ever again, Leo.

36:55.125 --> 36:56.126
You can never

36:56.301 --> 36:57.911
tell Piper about us.

36:58.085 --> 37:00.783
Not until she's truly ready.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.357
Leo, please.

37:09.531 --> 37:10.924
This is not the time
or place, okay.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.447
I don't want to get
into this right now.

37:12.621 --> 37:13.492
This is a little dicey.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.058
Okay.

37:15.233 --> 37:16.190
Thank you.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.758
You're distracted.
Please.

37:18.932 --> 37:20.716
Don't tell me how to demon hunt.

37:20.890 --> 37:23.502
I'm not. I didn't mean to.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.721
Let's just focus
on getting the demons.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.811
Not too much beetle toe,

37:28.985 --> 37:29.725
you don't want to blow
up the place, do you?

37:29.899 --> 37:31.161
No.

37:31.336 --> 37:33.512
Why are you being
so nice all of a sudden?

37:33.686 --> 37:36.166
I don't know.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.430
I guess I just...

37:38.604 --> 37:40.606
realize I can't force
things on you.

37:40.780 --> 37:42.129
If you're going to trust me,

37:42.303 --> 37:43.522
you're going to come
to it in your own time.

37:43.696 --> 37:44.827
Hmm.

37:45.001 --> 37:46.916
There may be hope for you yet.

37:47.090 --> 37:49.484
Bottle up the potions,

37:49.658 --> 37:52.444
I think I know where the demons
are going to attack next?

37:58.754 --> 38:00.582
LEO:
Now.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.411
[yells]

38:03.585 --> 38:05.979
That was easy.

38:06.153 --> 38:07.763
Wait.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.293
Hey.

38:19.645 --> 38:20.994
All right,

38:21.168 --> 38:22.691
now all we have to do
is get rid of the

38:22.865 --> 38:25.128
other gang and we can
bring the Innocent back.

38:25.303 --> 38:26.521
All right, I give up.

38:26.695 --> 38:27.957
How did you figure
all this out?

38:28.131 --> 38:30.960
You don't want to know.
Believe me.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.725
What?

38:56.899 --> 38:59.293
Nothing.

38:59.467 --> 39:00.947
Just, uh...

39:01.121 --> 39:03.558
glad you gave me another
shot, that's all.

39:03.732 --> 39:05.778
You didn't
think I would?

39:05.952 --> 39:08.302
Well, I didn't
hear from you

39:08.476 --> 39:09.956
after I botched breakfast.

39:10.130 --> 39:13.829
Well, breakfast isn't really
a date anyway, right?

39:14.003 --> 39:15.048
A dinner...

39:15.222 --> 39:16.223
much better.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.442
And dessert?

39:17.616 --> 39:20.314
Dessert, too.
Dessert is good.

39:20.488 --> 39:23.839
Now Agent Brody, you
are a damn fine cook.

39:24.013 --> 39:26.625
Any other secrets I
should know about you?

39:26.799 --> 39:30.542
Other than my crazed
obsession with Avatars...

39:30.716 --> 39:32.848
Nah, you're not
so crazed.

39:33.022 --> 39:34.676
No?

39:34.850 --> 39:37.113
Wait till I meet one.

39:39.594 --> 39:41.291
Forget that.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.598
Let's, uh...
rewind.

39:43.772 --> 39:45.426
And you can, uh...

39:45.600 --> 39:48.298
Ask me the secrets
questions again, okay?

39:48.473 --> 39:54.000
Do you, Kyle Brody,
have any secrets?

39:57.743 --> 39:59.135
No.

40:28.643 --> 40:30.993
Are they asleep?

40:31.167 --> 40:33.387
Yeah.

40:33.561 --> 40:34.562
Finally.

40:34.736 --> 40:35.650
Piper?

40:35.824 --> 40:37.304
Hmm?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.088
Look, I know you think

40:39.262 --> 40:40.916
there's something I
haven't been telling you.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.092
Leo, not now.

40:43.266 --> 40:44.267
Just hear me out.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.574
There actually is something

40:46.748 --> 40:49.621
I'm not telling you but not
because I don't want to.

40:49.795 --> 40:51.057
It's because I can't.

40:51.231 --> 40:53.581
What do you mean you can't?

40:53.755 --> 40:55.148
The Elders won't let you?

40:55.322 --> 40:57.585
Oh, I can't even tell you that.

41:00.327 --> 41:01.937
I can tell you you're
going to find out soon.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.723
And you're going
to be okay with it.

41:04.897 --> 41:07.421
Oh, yeah?
How do you know?

41:07.595 --> 41:10.424
I know you.
