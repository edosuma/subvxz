WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:02.785
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.439
WONKRU IS WEAK,

00:04.482 --> 00:06.006
AND THEIR GUNS WERE STOLEN.

00:06.049 --> 00:08.008
MY GUESS--IT WAS
THE ELIGIUS PRISONERS.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.574
THERE WAS A BREAK-IN
LAST NIGHT.

00:09.618 --> 00:11.359
AND YOU THINK
WE'RE RESPONSIBLE?

00:11.402 --> 00:14.057
RUSSELL: YOU AND
THE PRISONERS SHARE AN ENEMY.

00:14.101 --> 00:17.104
YOU MAKE ALLIES OF THE MURDERERS
AND THE THIEVES.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.801
DIYOZA: GABRIEL,
OPEN THE DOOR.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.324
GABRIEL:
I CAN'T LET YOU RISK IT.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.648
MAN: COME ON.

00:39.691 --> 00:42.042
- WHAT IS IT?
- UP. COME.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.739
LET'S GO.

00:46.089 --> 00:47.917
GABRIEL: WHERE ARE WE GOING?

00:47.960 --> 00:49.310
LOOK, MY FRIENDS--
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM?

00:49.353 --> 00:51.094
DOUBT THEY'D
CALL YOU A FRIEND

00:51.138 --> 00:52.748
SINCE YOU GOT THEM
CAPTURED.

00:52.791 --> 00:55.185
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
ECHO! HOPE! I'M SORRY!

01:00.756 --> 01:03.106
CONDUCTOR: THE FIRE
THAT CONSUMED...

01:03.150 --> 01:05.456
ANDERS: DR. SANTIAGO.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.546
COME. PLEASE.

01:08.590 --> 01:10.983
...WAR TO END ALL WARS...

01:13.464 --> 01:15.553
MIRACULOUS,
ISN'T IT?

01:15.597 --> 01:18.339
A GIFT FROM THOSE
WHO HAVE TRANSCENDED,

01:18.382 --> 01:21.081
OR SO WE BELIEVE.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.648
LORENZA,
WE CAN PROCEED.

01:23.692 --> 01:25.476
TRANSCENDED?

01:25.520 --> 01:28.044
THE SHEPHERD TEACHES US
THAT WINNING THE LAST WAR

01:28.088 --> 01:30.612
BRINGS UPON THE FINAL
EVOLUTION OF A SPECIES.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.093
I THOUGHT ORLANDO
WOULD HAVE TAUGHT YOU THAT.

01:35.312 --> 01:37.662
HE HANGED HIMSELF
IN THE CABIN.

01:39.186 --> 01:43.190
IT APPEARS WE NEED TO
RETHINK OUR PENAL SYSTEM.

01:43.233 --> 01:47.150
WE LOST 25 DISCIPLES
THANKS TO YOU AND YOURS.

01:47.194 --> 01:50.371
I JUST SENT THE OTHERS
OFF TO NAKARA,

01:50.414 --> 01:56.159
BUT I THOUGHT THAT
YOU MIGHT LIKE TO
SAY GOOD-BYE.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.161
I'M SURE HOPE
AND ECHO WOULD, TOO.

01:58.205 --> 02:02.034
WE HAVE DIFFERENT
PLANS FOR THEM.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.645
PLEASE.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.284
IS NAKARA YOUR HEAVEN?

02:34.328 --> 02:36.765
HE LEFT THAT OUT,
TOO, DID HE?

02:38.506 --> 02:41.465
NO, WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN HEAVEN, DOCTOR.

02:41.509 --> 02:46.166
LIKE I SAID, WE BELIEVE
IN TRANSCENDENCE.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.821
TRANSCENDENCE
THROUGH THE STONE?

02:49.865 --> 02:51.693
CORRECT. FROM
THE LITTLE WE'VE

02:51.736 --> 02:53.782
GATHERED ABOUT YOU
FROM OCTAVIA,

02:53.825 --> 02:55.784
I BELIEVE THAT YOU
CAN HELP US GET THERE.

02:55.827 --> 02:58.743
REALLY? AND WHY
WOULD I HELP YOU?

02:58.787 --> 03:02.530
BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE EXECUTED.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.272
I DON'T WANT MY FRIENDS
TO BE EXECUTED EITHER.

03:05.315 --> 03:06.882
WELL, THAT'S UP TO THEM.

03:06.925 --> 03:09.450
YOU'VE BEEN STUDYING
THE STONE FOR
150 YEARS.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.930
WE'VE BEEN DOING SO
FOR NEARLY 1,000,

03:11.974 --> 03:15.325
AND STILL, ITS TRUE POWER
REMAINS LOCKED AWAY.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.632
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO
HELP US UNLOCK IT.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.938
WE'LL SHARE OUR
KNOWLEDGE, YOU'LL
SHARE YOURS,

03:19.982 --> 03:21.984
AND ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS SAY, "YES,"

03:22.027 --> 03:24.900
AND TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW
ABOUT CLARKE GRIFFIN.

03:24.943 --> 03:28.556
CLARKE? WHAT DOES CLARKE
HAVE TO DO WITH
ANY OF THIS?

03:28.599 --> 03:32.299
SHE'S THE KEY
TO EVERYTHING.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.738
JOIN OUR CIPHER TEAM

03:36.781 --> 03:39.306
AND YOU'LL
UNDERSTAND WHY.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.488
DO I GET A ROBE?

04:25.482 --> 04:27.397
RISE AND SHINE,
ERRAND BOY.

04:27.441 --> 04:30.748
THE DARK COMMANDER
NEEDS HIS BREAKFAST.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.665
NO ONE ELSE IS ALLOWED
TO TALK TO HIM,

04:34.709 --> 04:37.102
AND IF YOU WAIT TOO LONG,
SOMEONE MIGHT.

04:37.146 --> 04:39.627
LAST THING WE NEED IS FOR HIM
TO GET INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S HEAD.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.716
MURPHY:
FINE. I'M GOING.

04:41.759 --> 04:43.283
SHOULD HAVE GONE
WITH INDRA, THOUGH.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.067
SHE GOT TO GO LOOKING
FOR OUR FRIENDS

04:45.110 --> 04:47.809
WHILE WE'RE STUCK
HERE BABYSITTING
THE FANATICS.

04:47.852 --> 04:52.422
INDRA LEFT US IN CHARGE
BECAUSE THE FAITHFUL
FOLLOW US BOTH.

04:52.466 --> 04:55.033
YOU'RE NOT WORRIED
ABOUT OUR FRIENDS?

04:55.077 --> 04:57.340
WELL, OUR FRIENDS CAN
TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES.

04:57.384 --> 05:00.343
I HAVE TO GET
BACK TO WORK.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.783
WELL, CLEARLY YOU'RE NOT
WORRIED ABOUT THE MISSING GUNS,

05:05.827 --> 05:08.569
OR YOU WOULDN'T STILL
BE PLANNING THIS LITTLE
PARTY OF YOURS.

05:08.612 --> 05:12.094
IT'S NOT A PARTY.
IT'S A REUNIFICATION
CEREMONY.

05:12.137 --> 05:13.356
RIGHT.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.271
KAYLEE'S DREAM
OF UNIFYING

05:15.315 --> 05:16.751
THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL WITH
THEIR FAMILIES--

05:16.794 --> 05:18.405
IT'S THE KEY
TO REAL PEACE,

05:18.448 --> 05:20.842
AND I'M WORRIED THAT
YOU'LL BE LATE FOR IT.

05:20.885 --> 05:23.105
ME? NO.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.237
NO WAY. THIS IS
YOUR DEAL, KAYLEE PRIME.

05:25.281 --> 05:28.023
AND IF I COULD,
I WOULD BE TALKING YOU
OUT OF IT.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.330
LOOK, DANIEL
SUPPORTED IT, TOO.

05:30.373 --> 05:33.333
I NEED YOU THERE
FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
FAVOR HIM.

05:33.376 --> 05:36.336
THE ROAD OUT OF
HELL IS PAVED WITH
GOOD DEEDS, JOHN.

05:38.773 --> 05:41.689
YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO HELL.

05:43.517 --> 05:46.041
FINE.
I WILL BE THERE

05:46.084 --> 05:48.260
RIGHT AFTER I BRING
SHEIDHEDA HIS POUND OF FLESH.

05:48.304 --> 05:52.221
AH! REFRESHMENTS.
THANK YOU FOR
REMINDING ME.

05:52.264 --> 05:53.962
YOU LIKE THIS.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.401
BEING THE QUEEN
OF THE CASTLE,
BEING WORSHIPPED.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.796
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.886
'SIDES, YOU'VE
WORSHIPPED ME FOR YEARS.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.284
JACKSON:
THIS ONE'S INTERESTING.

06:12.328 --> 06:13.677
WHAT IS IT?

06:17.768 --> 06:20.945
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETHING DANGEROUS?

06:20.989 --> 06:23.208
ARE YOU SURE?

06:23.252 --> 06:25.254
IT'S KIND OF BEAUTIFUL.

06:25.297 --> 06:26.429
WHO ARE THEY?

06:26.473 --> 06:27.996
I DON'T KNOW.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.218
DO YOU ALWAYS DRAW PICTURES
OF PEOPLE YOU DON'T KNOW?

06:33.262 --> 06:36.439
NO. LATELY, I GUESS.

06:37.832 --> 06:40.182
DOES THAT MEAN
I'M CRAZY OR SOMETHING?

06:40.225 --> 06:42.227
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, NO.

06:42.271 --> 06:43.664
YOU'RE NOT CRAZY.

06:43.707 --> 06:46.754
AND SECOND OF ALL,
WE DON'T LIKE THAT TERM.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.974
BUT YOU DID HAVE
A PANIC ATTACK
YESTERDAY WITH INDRA.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.629
LET'S GET BACK TO WHAT'S
REALLY BOTHERING YOU.

07:03.466 --> 07:06.513
DO YOU PLAY SOCCER,
MADI?

07:06.556 --> 07:10.647
NO. MY PARENTS
NEVER LET ME.

07:10.691 --> 07:14.999
TOO AFRAID I'D SCRAPE
A KNEE AND THEY'D
SEE MY BLOOD.

07:16.566 --> 07:19.874
AND WHEN THE FLEIMKEPAS
CAME, THEY HID YOU?

07:25.053 --> 07:28.883
SO...WHEN BELLAMY ASKED YOU
TO TAKE THE FLAME,

07:28.926 --> 07:31.581
HOW DID THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

07:31.625 --> 07:33.888
I WAS SCARED...

07:36.194 --> 07:39.154
BUT I HAD TO DO IT
TO SAVE CLARKE.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.114
THAT'S WHAT BELLAMY
TOLD YOU,

07:43.158 --> 07:45.160
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT,

07:45.203 --> 07:46.683
EVEN IF IT WAS TRUE.

07:49.686 --> 07:52.602
SO WHEN INDRA ASKED YOU
TO BE THE COMMANDER AGAIN,

07:52.646 --> 07:54.474
IT BROUGHT ALL THAT
BACK UP?

07:56.040 --> 07:57.955
MADI...

08:00.654 --> 08:04.266
YOU HAVE BEEN
THROUGH A LOT,

08:04.309 --> 08:07.487
AND YOU ARE SO STRONG,

08:07.530 --> 08:12.970
BUT YOU GOTTA CUT
YOURSELF SOME SLACK. OK?

08:13.014 --> 08:15.320
YOU'RE NOT
THE COMMANDER ANYMORE.

08:15.364 --> 08:18.236
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE
IT ALL ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.545
RIGHT?

08:22.589 --> 08:24.242
RIGHT.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.157
AND DO YOU MIND
IF I HANG ONTO THIS?

08:26.201 --> 08:29.030
DO YOU MIND IF I GO
PLAY SOCCER?

08:29.073 --> 08:31.293
YOU'D BE CRAZY NOT TO.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.732
THANKS, DR. JACKSON.

08:35.776 --> 08:38.300
ANOTHER SESSION
TOMORROW, RIGHT?

08:38.343 --> 08:40.258
RIGHT!

08:40.302 --> 08:42.522
GREAT. YOU'RE HERE.
SAVES ME A STOP.

08:42.565 --> 08:44.741
- HI, MADI!
- PASS IT.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.179
- MADI LOOKS BETTER.
- YEAH.

08:48.223 --> 08:50.312
COME HERE. I'VE GOT
ALMOST ALL THE DNA SAMPLES

08:50.355 --> 08:51.792
FROM THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL.

08:51.835 --> 08:54.011
THAT'S GREAT, BUT MAYBE
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT

08:54.055 --> 08:56.579
WHY YOU'RE DOING THIS
INSTEAD OF DOING IT.

08:56.623 --> 08:59.713
HA! OH, YOU REALLY ARE
IN SHRINK MODE TODAY,
AREN'T YOU?

08:59.756 --> 09:02.585
YOUR PARENTS LEFT YOU
OUT TO DIE, EMORI,

09:02.629 --> 09:04.456
JUST LIKE THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.024
IF I CAN GIVE THESE
PEOPLE PEACE,

09:07.068 --> 09:11.507
AND, YES, HEAL MYSELF
AT THE SAME TIME,

09:11.551 --> 09:13.683
HOW IS THAT
A BAD THING?

09:13.727 --> 09:17.557
MURPHY: MAYBE HE CAN DO
A BETTER JOB TALKING YOU
OUT OF IT THAN I DID.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.167
HE CAN'T!

09:19.210 --> 09:21.386
YEAH, YEAH.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.301
I'LL GET YOU
THE REST OF THE DNA.

09:23.345 --> 09:25.347
YOU GET ME THE NAMES
OF THEIR PARENTS.

09:31.658 --> 09:33.398
BLESSED IS DANIEL.

09:33.442 --> 09:35.487
I'D BE HAPPY TO
TAKE IT TO HIM,
MY LORD.

09:35.531 --> 09:38.273
I WOULD BE, TOO,
BELIEVE ME.

09:58.598 --> 10:02.123
INDRA HAS A NEW
SERVING BOY.

10:02.166 --> 10:05.692
NOT HUNGRY, SERVING BOY.
BE GONE.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.609
MY PLANS EXACTLY.

10:09.652 --> 10:13.134
MUST SUCK GOING
FROM THE PENTHOUSE
TO THE OUTHOUSE.

10:15.310 --> 10:18.922
I'M ENJOYING IT, THOUGH.
COMFORTABLE BED.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.795
JO JUICE
FLOWING FROM THE TAPS.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.928
INDRA MUST TRUST YOU
TO SEND YOU IN HERE WITH ME.

10:24.972 --> 10:29.498
OH, TRUST ME?
NO ONE TRUSTS ME.

10:29.541 --> 10:33.676
SHE DOES, OR SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU WHO I WAS.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.290
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT, RUSS?

10:39.334 --> 10:42.206
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SCARED.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.599
I CAN FEEL IT.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.601
YOU DON'T NEED TO BE.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.256
WELL, FEAR'S ALWAYS
WORKED PRETTY WELL
FOR ME, SO...

10:48.299 --> 10:50.475
BEING FEARED
WORKS BETTER.

10:55.524 --> 10:57.787
SIT, PLEASE.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.963
I'LL TEACH YOU
HOW TO PLAY CHESS.

11:00.007 --> 11:02.183
BE NICE TO HAVE
A CONVERSATION

11:02.226 --> 11:07.710
WITH SOMEONE IN WHICH
I DON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
TO BE A HAND-WRINGING FOOL.

11:07.754 --> 11:10.539
WELL, AS MUCH FUN
AS THAT SOUNDS, I'VE
GOT THINGS TO DO.

11:10.582 --> 11:12.933
I SAVED YOU FROM
BEING BURNED ALIVE.

11:12.976 --> 11:14.848
ONE GAME.

11:14.891 --> 11:18.112
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.
IF YOU WIN,

11:18.155 --> 11:19.940
I'LL GIVE YOU WHAT
YOU WANT MOST OF ALL.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.724
AND WHAT IS THAT
EXACTLY?

11:21.768 --> 11:23.508
ENLIGHTEN ME, PLEASE.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.206
A CHANCE TO BE A HERO.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.774
YEAH, YOU DON'T
KNOW ME VERY WELL.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.428
I KNOW YOU WENT INTO
THAT TAVERN TO SAVE A CHILD

11:30.472 --> 11:32.169
AT GREAT RISK TO YOURSELF.

11:32.213 --> 11:35.042
WERE YOU SCARED WHEN THEY
WERE PREPARING YOU TO BURN,

11:35.085 --> 11:37.435
AS SCARED AS YOU ARE
RIGHT NOW?

11:37.479 --> 11:38.785
I'M NOT SCARED.

11:38.828 --> 11:41.091
GOOD. THEN LET'S PLAY.

11:44.486 --> 11:46.662
HOW CAN YOU
MAKE ME A HERO?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.882
I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

11:48.925 --> 11:52.929
I JUST ASSUME IT MEANS
YOU KNOW SOMETHING BAD
IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.583
BAD DEPENDS
ON YOUR PERSPECTIVE,

11:54.626 --> 11:57.064
BUT FROM YOUR
PERSPECTIVE, YES.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.675
SOMETHING BAD IS
ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.852
YOUR MOVE.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.854
AND IF I LOSE?

12:04.898 --> 12:08.379
ONLY LOSERS THINK
LIKE THAT, JOHN.

12:10.251 --> 12:12.688
BUT THE ANSWER IS
PEOPLE WILL DIE.

12:15.735 --> 12:18.694
NO RUSH. IT'S NOT AS
IF LIVES DEPEND ON IT.

12:32.316 --> 12:34.275
THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT.

12:34.318 --> 12:35.755
AGGRESSIVE.

12:35.798 --> 12:37.147
SHUT UP AND MOVE.

12:41.064 --> 12:42.457
PLEASE.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.776
BELLAMY:
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:56.819 --> 12:59.866
CAN'T HANDLE FINALLY
BEING FORCED TO TAP?

12:59.909 --> 13:01.781
ECHO: TOOK YOU 3 YEARS.

13:01.824 --> 13:05.088
COME BACK. MURPHY
WANTS A SHOT
AT THE TITLE.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.177
YOU CAN COACH HIM
ON MY WEAKNESSES.

13:07.221 --> 13:09.919
I DON'T THINK
YOU HAVE ANY.

13:16.143 --> 13:20.060
NO. EVERYBODY HAS
THEIR WEAKNESSES.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.497
MY SISTER IS MINE.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.326
YOUR SISTER
IS YOUR STRENGTH.

13:25.369 --> 13:26.936
THE REASON WHY YOU
WON'T GIVE UP

13:26.980 --> 13:28.808
UNTIL WE GET
BACK DOWN THERE.

13:31.462 --> 13:33.334
SO WHAT'S MY WEAKNESS?

13:33.377 --> 13:37.686
HA! YOURS IS TRICKY.

13:37.729 --> 13:41.646
NOW, YOU DON'T
TALK ABOUT YOURSELF MUCH,

13:41.690 --> 13:43.823
AND YOU'RE A SHAPESHIFTER.

13:46.303 --> 13:51.004
LOYALTY. LOYALTY
IS YOUR WEAKNESS.

13:51.047 --> 13:53.310
LOYALTY IS NOT
A WEAKNESS.

13:53.354 --> 13:56.748
IT IS WHEN IT CAUSES
YOU TO DO SOMETHING
YOU KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.274
NEARLY KILLING
OCTAVIA...

14:03.059 --> 14:05.496
BETRAYING YOU
AT MOUNT WEATHER.

14:05.540 --> 14:09.761
ECHO. ECHO, WE HAVE
ALL DONE BAD THINGS,

14:09.805 --> 14:13.330
SOME OF THEM
TO EACH OTHER.

14:13.374 --> 14:16.420
BUT WE ARE A TEAM NOW.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.987
A UNIT.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.860
THAT'S THE REASON WE'LL
GET BACK TO THE GROUND.

14:22.339 --> 14:24.515
THINK YOU COULD
BE LOYAL TO US?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.562
I'D LIKE THAT.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.306
BELLAMY,
THIS ISN'T REAL.

14:32.349 --> 14:35.352
AS SOON AS WE GET
BACK TO THE GROUND,
ALL OF THIS--

15:05.992 --> 15:07.428
OCTAVIA:
I MISS HIM, TOO.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.560
I DON'T WANNA TALK.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.783
I KNOW YOU'RE
IN PAIN, ECHO.

15:14.826 --> 15:16.524
I FEEL IT.

15:19.396 --> 15:23.923
SO, WHAT?
ARE WE FRIENDS NOW?

15:23.966 --> 15:28.405
I'M THE MONSTER FROM
HOPE'S BEDTIME STORIES,
REMEMBER?

15:28.449 --> 15:32.583
ECHO, WE'VE ALL DONE THINGS
WE WISH WE COULD TAKE BACK.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.847
WHEN LINCOLN DIED,
I BEAT MY BROTHER.

15:35.891 --> 15:39.547
HE LET ME...

15:39.590 --> 15:42.376
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
I NEEDED IT.

15:42.419 --> 15:46.946
I WISH I COULD
TAKE THAT MOMENT BACK.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.951
I WISH I'D
HUGGED HIM INSTEAD.

15:51.994 --> 15:55.215
LET GO OF ME.
LET GO OF ME.

15:55.258 --> 15:58.392
NO. NO. NO WAY. NO.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.437
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

16:03.136 --> 16:07.401
I'VE BEEN THERE.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.845
YOU'RE MY FAMILY, TOO.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.944
ECHO!

16:33.079 --> 16:35.603
ECHO THE ONE
WHO TAUGHT YOU TO FIGHT?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.344
NO. MY FATHER DID THAT.

16:37.387 --> 16:38.998
DID HE NOW?

16:39.041 --> 16:41.826
DEV, A DISCIPLE PRISONER
WHO SHOWED UP

16:41.870 --> 16:44.525
6 MONTHS AFTER YOU LEFT.

16:44.568 --> 16:47.180
I SUPPOSE I SHOULD
BE GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

16:47.223 --> 16:49.051
HE WAS A GOOD MAN.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.140
WAS?

16:51.184 --> 16:55.536
NEXT TIME THIS
DOOR OPENS, WE ATTACK
FROM EACH SIDE.

16:55.579 --> 16:59.192
THEY'LL COME IN HOT
AND WITH NUMBERS.
BAD PLAN.

16:59.235 --> 17:01.368
OK, THEN TELL ME HOW
THE HELL YOU GOT UP
THE LAST TIME.

17:01.411 --> 17:02.543
THAT'S DISHES,
YOUNG LADY.

17:02.586 --> 17:03.979
MOM, I'M SERIOUS.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.415
HOW DID YOU DO IT?

17:05.459 --> 17:08.157
I RIPPED A MAN'S JUGULAR
OUT WITH MY TEETH,

17:08.201 --> 17:11.769
THEN SCOOPED HIS EYE OUT AND
USED IT ON THE RETINAL SCANNER.

17:14.381 --> 17:16.774
IT WON'T WORK AGAIN.

17:16.818 --> 17:20.039
I WAS ON MY WAY
TO OCTAVIA AND THEN
BACK TO SKYRING.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.084
WHY DID YOU COME HERE?

17:22.128 --> 17:23.781
TO SAVE YOU.

17:23.825 --> 17:25.653
I KNOW YOUR HEART WAS
IN THE RIGHT PLACE, BUT--

17:25.696 --> 17:28.308
- BUT?
- BUT YOU'RE MY CHILD!

17:28.351 --> 17:30.092
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO
RESCUE ME.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.746
I WAS COMING FOR YOU.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.009
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA
ROT IN HERE WITH ME

17:34.053 --> 17:35.576
UNTIL THEY EXECUTE US,
BUT HEY,

17:35.619 --> 17:37.752
AT LEAST WE GET TO
DIE TOGETHER.

17:37.795 --> 17:41.147
YOU'RE JUST MAD BECAUSE
I TURNED OUT TO BE
A KILLER LIKE YOU.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.295
SO WHAT'S YOUR
ENDGAME, NIKKI?

17:59.339 --> 18:01.341
WELL, GEE, NELSON,
I DON'T KNOW.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.734
DOES REVENGE COUNT?

18:03.778 --> 18:05.258
YOU LOST YOUR HUSBAND.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.217
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.089
BUT THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL HAVE A MISSION,

18:10.132 --> 18:13.701
AND IT DOES NOT INVOLVE
GETTING INNOCENT PEOPLE KILLED.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.703
DON'T KID YOURSELF,
HONEY.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.792
THERE'S NO INNOCENT
PEOPLE AT THE END
OF THE WORLD.

18:17.835 --> 18:20.099
I DON'T CARE WHAT
PLANET YOU'RE
STANDING ON.

18:22.710 --> 18:26.105
LOOK, YOU'VE
HAD IT ROUGH.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.890
BUT FROM WHERE I SIT,
OUR MISSION IS OVER.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.370
YOU SAID RUSSELL IS DEAD

18:30.413 --> 18:33.329
AND SO ARE DANIEL
AND KAYLEE.

18:33.373 --> 18:35.288
WHAT DOES DEATH
TO PRIMES MEAN

18:35.331 --> 18:38.421
IF THERE ARE NO MORE
PRIMES TO MAKE DEAD?

18:38.465 --> 18:40.293
JOIN US.

18:40.336 --> 18:43.122
A LITTLE DEPROGRAMMING,
SOME REVENGE.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.559
WE'LL SPLIT THIS PLACE
50/50,

18:45.602 --> 18:47.952
BUT I GET THE PALACE.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.563
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.391
PARTNERS?

18:54.655 --> 18:56.613
NELSON!

18:56.657 --> 18:59.355
THERE YOU ARE.

18:59.399 --> 19:01.879
WELL, LOOK AT YOU!

19:01.923 --> 19:03.664
ALL PERKY AND PRETTY.

19:03.707 --> 19:06.971
I GUESS RAVEN KNEW YOU'D
BOUNCE RIGHT BACK, HUH?

19:07.015 --> 19:10.627
OR IS IT PALACE LIFE
THAT'S GIVING YOU THAT GLOW?

19:10.671 --> 19:13.543
WE'RE IN THE PALACE
TO MAINTAIN PEACE.
THAT'S ALL.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.633
OH! WELL, YOU ARE
DOING A BANG-UP JOB.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.897
MY OFFER'S GOOD TILL LUNCH.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.774
MIND IF I SIT?

19:26.817 --> 19:28.167
WHY WOULD I MIND?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.474
I'M NOT HERE.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.824
- WAIT--
- DON'T TOUCH ME, PRIME!

19:35.826 --> 19:37.741
MY PEOPLE ARE WATCHING.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.352
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT?

19:41.049 --> 19:44.748
WHAT I WANT
IS TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.229
ALL OF THEM.

19:47.273 --> 19:50.624
NOT JUST THE CHILDREN
OF GABRIEL.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.974
AND I KNOW
YOU DO, TOO.

19:53.017 --> 19:56.195
YOU KNOW NOTHING
ABOUT ME.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.241
MMM.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.896
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL,

20:01.939 --> 20:03.898
'CAUSE I FELT IT,
TOO.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.422
YOU BETTER
GET TO THE POINT.

20:12.123 --> 20:15.083
WHEN I WAS A CHILD
ON EARTH,

20:15.126 --> 20:19.043
PEOPLE LIKE ME WERE
SEEN AS A STAIN
ON THE BLOODLINE.

20:19.087 --> 20:22.133
THEY CALLED US
FRIKDREINA,

20:22.177 --> 20:24.788
NOT NULLS, BUT IT'S
THE SAME THING.

20:24.832 --> 20:28.270
I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO BE THROWN OUT
LIKE GARBAGE

20:28.314 --> 20:32.274
BY THE PEOPLE WHO SHOULD
LOVE YOU THE MOST.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.755
I'M STILL WAITING
ON THAT POINT.

20:37.236 --> 20:42.893
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING
FOR THE CHANCE
TO SEE THEM AGAIN,

20:42.937 --> 20:46.157
ASK THEM WHY,
SHOW THEM

20:46.201 --> 20:47.811
HOW WRONG THEY
WERE ABOUT ME.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.857
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN
ABOUT ANY OF THAT.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.424
THEN WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

20:51.467 --> 20:53.382
GO BACK TO WHATEVER
CAVE YOU LIVED IN.

20:53.426 --> 20:56.907
I'M DONE
LIVING IN CAVES.

20:56.951 --> 20:59.954
THIS IS MY HOME.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.782
YES, IT IS.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.871
THE CEREMONY
IS THIS AFTERNOON.

21:03.914 --> 21:09.224
I CAN REUNITE YOU
WITH YOUR FAMILY,
NELSON.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.617
LET ME DO THAT.

21:15.752 --> 21:17.624
THEY CAN BURN
FOR ALL I CARE.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.541
NELSON: LET'S GO.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.421
MURPHY: OH, NOW
I REMEMBER WHY
I HATE CHESS.

21:32.465 --> 21:33.901
WHY?

21:33.944 --> 21:35.511
TOO MUCH THINKING.
MAKE YOUR MOVE.

21:37.905 --> 21:39.646
SOMEWHERE ELSE
YOU NEED TO BE?

21:39.689 --> 21:42.344
SOMEBODY ELSE I NEED
TO NOT DISAPPOINT.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.912
AH, YES.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.524
THE FRIKDREINA.

21:50.700 --> 21:53.268
THAT'S IT?
20 MINUTES FOR THAT?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.749
YOU COULD HAVE
TAKEN MY CASTLE.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.360
OH, I'LL GET IT
SOON ENOUGH.

21:59.709 --> 22:02.712
MUST BE HARD SETTLING
FOR ONE WOMAN,

22:02.756 --> 22:06.368
WHEN AS A GOD YOU COULD
HAVE AS MANY AS YOU WANT.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.891
YOU DON'T KNOW EMORI.

22:07.935 --> 22:10.633
PERHAPS NOT,
BUT FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN,

22:10.677 --> 22:13.723
SHE'S TAKING A LIKING
TO BEING WORSHIPPED.

22:16.770 --> 22:18.380
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

22:18.424 --> 22:21.383
WHAT ABOUT ME WHAT?

22:21.427 --> 22:23.820
I MEAN, I ASSUME
YOU DON'T LIKE WOMEN
VERY MUCH,

22:23.864 --> 22:26.214
BUT THEN AGAIN,
HOW COULD YOU?

22:26.257 --> 22:28.564
MOTHER GAVE YOU UP
TO FIGHT IN THE CONCLAVE

22:28.608 --> 22:32.568
AND BECOME COMMANDER,
THEN THERE'S THE
WHOLE LEXA THING.

22:32.612 --> 22:37.094
KNOWING THAT SHE IS
EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE
WHEN THEY HATED YOU.

22:37.138 --> 22:38.792
THEN AGAIN, SHE DID
UNITE THE CLANS.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.881
I UNITED THE CLANS!

22:40.924 --> 22:43.753
PLEASE. THE ONLY
PEOPLE YOU UNITED
WERE THE FLAMEKEEPERS

22:43.797 --> 22:47.104
WHO BANDED TOGETHER
TO KILL YOU.

22:47.148 --> 22:50.586
THEY KILLED ME BECAUSE
THEY WERE AFRAID OF MY IDEAS.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.502
JUST LIKE THEY KILLED LEXA.

22:53.546 --> 22:56.026
BUT DON'T WORRY.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.681
I WON'T LET THAT
HAPPEN AGAIN.

22:58.725 --> 23:00.770
AGAIN.

23:00.814 --> 23:04.252
SO THAT IS WHAT YOU
WANT, TO BE BACK IN
POWER, BIG MAN?

23:04.295 --> 23:07.908
WELL DONE, JOHN.
YOU JUST FIGURED OUT
WHAT INDRA KNEW

23:07.951 --> 23:11.390
THE MOMENT SHE REALIZED
THAT I WAS ALIVE.

23:12.956 --> 23:17.004
SO MUCH FOR
THE QUEEN'S GAMBIT.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.527
AHH...

23:20.616 --> 23:24.794
THERE ARE LEADERS,
AND THERE ARE FOLLOWERS.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.101
HOW YOU RESPOND TO
THE LOSS OF YOUR QUEEN

23:27.144 --> 23:29.408
WILL TELL ME
WHAT YOU ARE.

23:29.451 --> 23:31.671
WELL, I'M GONNA
TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.282
THE ANSWER'S "C,"
NONE OF THE ABOVE.

23:34.325 --> 23:36.371
A REBEL, THEN.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.894
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

23:39.505 --> 23:41.681
I DO WHAT I HAVE TO
TO SURVIVE, YEAH.

23:41.724 --> 23:44.248
THEN WHY ARE YOU HERE?

23:44.292 --> 23:46.555
PLAYING CHESS WITH
A MAN WHO COULD KILL YOU

23:46.599 --> 23:48.427
MORE WAYS THAN
CAN BE COUNTED

23:48.470 --> 23:52.169
IN ORDER TO SATISFY
AN INNER NEED TO BE LOVED

23:52.213 --> 23:54.737
IS NOT THE MOVE
OF A SURVIVOR.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.437
LET'S JUST PLAY THE GAME.

24:00.264 --> 24:02.658
CHESS IS MORE
THAN A GAME, JOHN.

24:02.702 --> 24:07.402
IT'S STRATEGY
AND UNCERTAINTY

24:07.446 --> 24:10.057
GOVERNED BY CHOICES.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.500
AVENGING YOUR QUEEN.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.110
PREDICTABLE.

24:20.154 --> 24:21.503
ENOUGH WITH
THE CHESS METAPHORS!

24:21.547 --> 24:23.287
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
TO EMORI--

24:23.331 --> 24:26.377
BEFORE YOU THREATEN ME,
THINK CAREFULLY.

24:31.687 --> 24:33.646
I LIKE YOU, JOHN.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.386
YOU AMUSE ME.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.957
BUT A REAL SURVIVOR
WOULD CHOOSE TO STAY
ON MY GOOD SIDE

24:41.001 --> 24:44.091
IN THE OFF CHANCE
I ESCAPE THIS CAGE

24:44.134 --> 24:47.921
AND TAKE MY RIGHTFUL
PLACE ON THE THRONE.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.054
ARE YOU WILLING
TO BET AGAINST THAT?

24:53.927 --> 24:55.755
IF YOU KNEW
WHAT I WAS PLANNING,

24:55.798 --> 24:57.365
I DON'T THINK
YOU WOULD BE.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.541
TELL ME WHAT IT IS,
AND I'LL DECIDE.

24:59.585 --> 25:02.457
WIN THE GAME...

25:02.501 --> 25:04.633
AND I WILL.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.555
WHAT ELSE DID
GABRIEL TELL YOU?

25:13.599 --> 25:15.688
I TAKE IT HE SAID
I WAS A KILLER.

25:15.731 --> 25:18.473
I'M ASKING
HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.215
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

25:21.258 --> 25:22.912
IT DOES TO ME.

25:33.227 --> 25:37.536
HE SAID YOU WERE
A NAVY SEAL AND
A DECORATED HERO

25:37.579 --> 25:41.931
WHO SAVED THOUSANDS
OF LIVES IN THE
BATTLE OF SAN FRANCISCO

25:41.975 --> 25:45.239
BEFORE BECOMING
A FREEDOM FIGHTER.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.590
YOU MEAN TERRORIST?

25:50.026 --> 25:52.551
HE SAID TERRORIST,
RIGHT?

25:52.594 --> 25:54.291
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

25:54.335 --> 25:55.858
ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

25:57.773 --> 25:59.819
GOD, I HATE THAT
YOU KNOW THAT.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.171
YOU WEREN'T GONNA
TELL ME?

26:04.214 --> 26:06.434
SURE, EVENTUALLY,
WHEN YOU WERE OLD ENOUGH.

26:06.477 --> 26:07.609
I'M 25.

26:10.177 --> 26:13.049
TO ME, YOU'RE NOT.

26:13.093 --> 26:15.399
FROM THE FIRST TIME
YOU LOOKED AT ME

26:15.443 --> 26:17.140
WITH THOSE
BIG BROWN EYES,

26:17.184 --> 26:19.752
YOU ONLY SAW MOMMY.

26:19.795 --> 26:23.233
BUT OTHER PEOPLE,
THEY SEE A KILLER,

26:23.277 --> 26:25.453
A MASS MURDERER,

26:25.496 --> 26:27.150
A TERRORIST.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.326
I KNEW IF YOU EVER
LOOKED AT ME LIKE THAT,

26:29.370 --> 26:31.241
MY HEART WOULD BREAK
INTO 1,000 PIECES.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.547
I DON'T.

26:33.940 --> 26:36.159
NOW I KNOW YOU WERE TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

26:36.203 --> 26:40.511
DOING THE RIGHT THING
THE WRONG WAY ISN'T
DOING THE RIGHT THING.

26:40.555 --> 26:42.470
I KNOW THAT NOW.

26:42.513 --> 26:45.386
INNOCENT PEOPLE DIED
FROM MY RIGHT THING.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.301
CIVILIANS.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.737
CHILDREN.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.305
AND FOR WHAT?
NOTHING!

26:51.348 --> 26:53.220
EARTH IS GONE,
BLOWN UP.

26:53.263 --> 26:55.744
TWICE.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.485
YOU CAN THANK YOUR
REAL FATHER

26:57.528 --> 26:59.008
FOR THAT,
BY THE WAY.

26:59.052 --> 27:00.793
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
MY FATHER BEFORE.

27:00.836 --> 27:03.186
HOW MUCH DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW?

27:03.230 --> 27:05.667
EVERYTHING.

27:05.711 --> 27:07.756
HE WAS A PSYCHOPATH

27:07.800 --> 27:09.453
AND A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

27:09.497 --> 27:11.630
I HAD SEX WITH HIM
TO GET HIM ON MY SIDE

27:11.673 --> 27:13.719
IN AN UPRISING
ON THE MINING SHIP.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.721
NOT MY BEST DECISION,

27:15.764 --> 27:21.509
BUT IT LED TO
THE BEST THING THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

27:21.552 --> 27:24.207
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.
THE LAST THING I WANT

27:24.251 --> 27:26.079
IS FOR YOU TO FOLLOW
IN MY FOOTSTEPS.

27:26.122 --> 27:28.690
EVERYONE I EVER LOVED
WAS KILLED FIGHTING IN WARS,

27:28.734 --> 27:31.127
SOME THAT DIDN'T NEED
TO BE FOUGHT,

27:31.171 --> 27:33.695
AND I'M NOT GONNA LET
THAT HAPPEN TO YOU.

27:33.739 --> 27:36.219
SO, WHAT,
WE STAY HERE?

27:36.263 --> 27:38.265
DO NOTHING?

27:38.308 --> 27:41.442
I TRAINED FOR 15 YEARS
UNDER 2 DISCIPLES.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.574
THE LAST 5 OF THEM
WERE WITH ECHO.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.578
I DID THAT TO SAVE YOU
AND AUNTY O.

27:47.622 --> 27:48.841
HELL OF A JOB YOU DID.

27:48.884 --> 27:50.320
YOU'RE ALIVE,
AREN'T YOU?

27:50.364 --> 27:51.539
SO IS SHE.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.367
SURE, UNTIL WE'RE NOT!

27:53.410 --> 27:54.890
IF THEY WANT TO KILL US,
THEN LET THEM TR--

27:54.934 --> 27:56.326
HOPE, DON'T BE STUPID.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.719
WHAT ARE WE
GONNA DO?

27:57.763 --> 27:59.547
TAKE ON AN ENTIRE ARMY?

27:59.590 --> 28:02.071
IF WE HAVE TO.

28:02.115 --> 28:03.856
WITH OCTAVIA, ECHO,
YOU, AND ME,

28:03.899 --> 28:05.814
I LIKE OUR CHANCES.

28:05.858 --> 28:08.556
YOU SAY YOU'RE NOT
A CHILD. STOP
TALKING LIKE ONE.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.125
YOU WANT TO
TAKE ON AN ARMY?

28:14.301 --> 28:16.695
TELL YOU WHAT...

28:16.738 --> 28:19.262
PUT ME ON MY ASS,
AND I'LL LET YOU.

28:19.306 --> 28:21.134
HELL, I'LL EVEN
HELP YOU.

28:23.092 --> 28:25.268
GO AHEAD.
TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT.

28:25.312 --> 28:26.661
I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

28:28.097 --> 28:30.621
IT'S OK.
I CAN TAKE IT.

28:33.102 --> 28:34.669
- UHH!
- OH, COME ON.

28:34.713 --> 28:35.975
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT?

28:39.326 --> 28:41.720
COME ON, LITTLE ONE.

28:41.763 --> 28:44.244
NEXT TIME THAT DOOR OPENS,
WE GOTTA ATTACK, RIGHT?

28:44.287 --> 28:46.768
- UHH!
- AAH!

28:52.382 --> 28:53.862
ARE WE HAVING
FUN YET?

28:56.691 --> 28:59.302
- NO!
- STOP!

28:59.346 --> 29:02.088
VIOLENCE AND RAGE
WILL ONLY DESTROY
YOUR SOUL.

29:02.131 --> 29:05.091
REVENGE IS A GAME
WITH NO WINNERS.

29:05.134 --> 29:08.181
AND WE'VE LOST
TOO MUCH ALREADY.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.844
JUST DISAPPEARED.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.849
JUST LIKE THAT,
YOU WERE GONE.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.245
OUT OF NOWHERE.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.161
JUST GONE.

29:35.338 --> 29:40.822
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS GO BACK TO THE WAY
THINGS WERE, BUT WE CAN'T.

29:43.346 --> 29:46.523
THEY TOOK MY MOMMY AWAY.

29:46.567 --> 29:49.048
THEY TOOK MY MOMMY.

29:51.093 --> 29:53.226
I KNOW, LITTLE ONE.

29:55.968 --> 29:59.580
THAT'S WHY I CAN'T
LOSE YOU AGAIN.

29:59.623 --> 30:01.060
I CAN'T...

30:03.323 --> 30:04.933
AND I WON'T.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.548
OCTAVIA:
SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT.

30:11.592 --> 30:14.813
THERE'S PLENTY OF CELLS,
BUT THEY PUT US TOGETHER.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.903
THEY'RE FEEDING US.
WE HAVE BLANKETS.

30:17.946 --> 30:19.948
WHY?

30:19.992 --> 30:22.124
DO YOU KNOW WHY
AZGEDA WARRIORS

30:22.168 --> 30:24.300
SCARRED
THEIR OWN FACES?

30:26.737 --> 30:28.348
E-ECHO?

30:33.092 --> 30:36.399
WE DO IT TO SYMBOLIZE
THAT THE PAIN IS OVER,

30:36.443 --> 30:39.272
THE WOUND IS HEALED,

30:39.315 --> 30:41.230
SO THAT WE
NEVER FORGET.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.189
SIT DOWN AND LET
ME CALL YOU A--

30:43.232 --> 30:47.846
NO. ORLANDO TOLD US
THAT ALL THEY CARE
ABOUT IS THEIR LAST WAR.

30:50.283 --> 30:51.893
THEY WANT US TO
FIGHT WITH THEM.

30:51.937 --> 30:53.895
THAT'S WHY
IT'S DIFFERENT.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.985
WE'RE NOT PRISONERS.

30:57.029 --> 30:58.726
WE'RE RECRUITS.

31:01.468 --> 31:02.730
WE'RE READY TO
FIGHT WITH YOU!

31:02.773 --> 31:04.210
PLEASE,
THIS IS CRAZY.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.952
WOMAN, OVER INTERCOM:
...PURITY OF MIND,

31:06.995 --> 31:08.214
PURITY OF PURPOSE.

31:08.257 --> 31:09.911
WE ARE BLESSED
TO LIVE IN AN AGE

31:09.955 --> 31:13.523
WHERE WE HAVE CONQUERED
OUR LESSER EMOTIONS.

31:15.221 --> 31:16.918
THE GREAT BATTLE
THAT IS TO COME
WILL BE RECORDED

31:16.962 --> 31:19.660
IN THIS LIFE OR THE NEXT.

31:19.703 --> 31:26.275
WAR, PESTILENCE,
FAMINE, DEATH.

31:26.319 --> 31:28.364
EVENTUALLY, IT DOES...

31:28.408 --> 31:29.713
ECHO: THIS IS HOW
MY PEOPLE SHOW

31:29.757 --> 31:31.367
THEY'RE READY
TO GO TO WAR.

31:31.411 --> 31:33.021
ANDERS: MMM.
I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

31:33.065 --> 31:35.110
DO THE REST OF YOU
AGREE WITH ECHO?

31:35.154 --> 31:38.984
OCTAVIA:
ALL RIGHT. FREE US,
AND WE'LL FIGHT YOUR WAR.

31:40.420 --> 31:43.466
THE LAST WAR WILL
FREE US ALL, MISS BLAKE.

31:43.510 --> 31:45.251
TRAINING STARTS TOMORROW.

31:45.294 --> 31:48.428
WE'LL MAKE DISCIPLES
OF YOU YET.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.344
WOMAN: THERE WILL COME
A TIME AGAIN, SOON,

31:51.387 --> 31:53.999
WHERE WE WILL BE
TESTED TO A MAN,

31:54.042 --> 31:57.872
AND WE WILL BE VICTORIOUS
FOR ALL MANKIND!

32:09.623 --> 32:11.930
IT'S PRETTY COOL
WHAT YOU'VE DONE HERE.

32:13.627 --> 32:15.934
NOW ALL WE NEED
IS JOHN.

32:21.896 --> 32:23.811
WELCOME. I'M GLAD YOU CAME.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.595
MAY I ASK? OUR BOY...

32:25.639 --> 32:29.338
NOT EVERYONE IS HERE
YET, BUT I AM SURE
HE WILL BE.

32:29.382 --> 32:33.386
JEREMIAH, PLEASE SHOW
NELSON'S PARENTS
TO THEIR TABLE.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.823
IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

32:35.866 --> 32:37.999
I THINK I MIGHT
FEEL BETTER
ABOUT THIS

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
WITH DANIEL PRIME'S
BLESSING.

32:40.045 --> 32:42.090
DANIEL WILL BE HERE
MOMENTARILY.

32:42.134 --> 32:43.962
YOU KNOW HOW HE IS
WITH TIME.

32:45.398 --> 32:48.053
JEREMIAH: WELCOME.

32:48.096 --> 32:49.968
ENJOY.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.553
YOU'RE LESS
CONFIDENT NOW.

33:10.597 --> 33:13.643
PERHAPS THAT'S
BECAUSE YOU'VE SEEN
HOW THIS ENDS.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.254
IT'S NOT OVER YET.

33:15.297 --> 33:18.605
MOST DANGEROUS
WHEN I'M CORNERED.

33:18.648 --> 33:20.520
THAT MAKES TWO OF US.

33:30.965 --> 33:32.532
CHECK.

33:32.575 --> 33:34.577
WHY? YOU COULD HAVE
WON WITH YOUR QUEEN.

33:34.621 --> 33:36.405
THAT WAS
THE CHECKMATE MOVE.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.146
YOU JUST WANT
TO KEEP ME HERE.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.192
KAYLEE'S ALWAYS BEEN
TOO SOFT.

33:40.235 --> 33:42.977
ONLY DANIEL'S WORDS
HOLD WATER WITH
THE TRUE FANATICS.

33:43.021 --> 33:45.936
WITHOUT HIM,
YOUR FRIKDREINA'S
CEREMONY

33:45.980 --> 33:48.287
WILL ALMOST
CERTAINLY FAIL.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.333
AAH! AAH!

33:51.377 --> 33:52.639
AAH!

33:52.682 --> 33:54.771
IF YOU MAKE A SOUND,
I'LL KILL YOU.

33:55.946 --> 33:57.383
CHECKMATE.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.092
NELSON: THIS WAS
A BAD IDEA.

34:11.136 --> 34:12.528
EMORI: AND YET,
YOU'RE HERE.

34:12.572 --> 34:15.705
IF I HAD THE CHANCE,
I'D HAVE COME, TOO.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.709
SO HOW DO WE DO IT?

34:19.753 --> 34:23.278
I ALREADY HAVE.
DON'T BE MAD.

34:23.322 --> 34:26.803
I KNOW YOU SAID NO,
BUT I TOOK YOUR GLASS

34:26.847 --> 34:32.331
AND I MATCHED YOUR DNA
BECAUSE I HOPED YOU'D
CHANGE YOUR MIND.

34:32.374 --> 34:35.116
YOUR PARENTS ARE HERE

34:35.160 --> 34:37.075
IF YOU WANT TO MEET THEM.

34:41.122 --> 34:42.471
THEY'RE NERVOUS, TOO.

34:42.515 --> 34:43.733
COME ON.

34:43.777 --> 34:47.781
EMORI: PAULA? ZAHIR?

34:47.824 --> 34:51.132
THIS IS YOUR SON
NELSON.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.445
SACHIN.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.188
THAT'S WHAT WE CALLED YOU.

35:04.798 --> 35:06.713
IT MEANS "PURE."

35:37.135 --> 35:38.571
NO.

35:40.921 --> 35:43.619
WE DID THE RIGHT THING.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.361
YOU ARE AN ABOMINATION.

35:46.405 --> 35:47.884
ALL OF YOU ARE!

35:49.582 --> 35:51.671
PAULA: ZAHIR, NO!

35:51.714 --> 35:54.500
EMORI: GUARDS! GUARDS!

35:54.543 --> 35:57.459
GUARDS! ZAHIR, STOP!

36:31.711 --> 36:33.669
YOU CAN CALL FOR
HELP NOW.

36:33.713 --> 36:36.237
HELP! GUARDS,
LET ME OUT OF HERE!

36:42.809 --> 36:46.508
ISN'T THIS A LOVELY PARTY?

36:46.552 --> 36:48.684
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

36:48.728 --> 36:50.773
UHH!
SHUT UP!

36:53.776 --> 36:55.213
PARTNERS?

36:55.256 --> 36:57.040
I'M WITH YOU.

36:58.694 --> 37:00.130
AND SO ARE MY PEOPLE.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.784
GOOD CHOICE.

37:01.828 --> 37:03.438
ALL COGs GET GUNS.

37:06.615 --> 37:09.052
NELSON, DON'T DO THIS.

37:09.096 --> 37:11.794
YOU DID THIS,
AND NOW

37:11.838 --> 37:15.711
YOU GET TO DIE FOR
IT, KAYLEE PRIME.

37:15.755 --> 37:18.888
NIKKI: OH! OH!

37:18.932 --> 37:21.587
OH, SLOW DOWN, COWBOY.

37:21.630 --> 37:24.503
FIRST WE MAKE DEMANDS,

37:24.546 --> 37:26.853
AND THEN WE GET
TO KILL PEOPLE.

37:29.986 --> 37:32.554
THERE'S NO NEED TO
RUSH THE GOOD STUFF.

37:44.610 --> 37:45.872
BEEN ENTERING CODES
FOR 3 MONTHS,

37:45.915 --> 37:47.700
AND I'M LOSING MY MIND.

37:47.743 --> 37:50.790
WHEW. HOW DO YOU
STAND IT?

37:50.833 --> 37:52.531
I KNOW IT'S NOT
EXCITING,

37:52.574 --> 37:54.968
BUT GOOD SCIENCE
TAKES TIME.

37:55.011 --> 37:56.709
THIS ISN'T SCIENCE.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.363
IT'S TRIAL AND ERROR.

37:58.406 --> 38:01.322
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE
YOU FOUND A NEW FUNCTION?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.237
IT WAS BEFORE
I JOINED THE TEAM,

38:03.281 --> 38:04.978
BEFORE I WAS BORN,
ACTUALLY,

38:05.021 --> 38:07.328
BUT IT WAS A GOOD ONE.

38:07.372 --> 38:10.288
THE 10-DIGIT CODE THAT
ALLOWS US TO HARNESS
THE POWER

38:10.331 --> 38:13.203
OF WHAT YOU CALL
THE "ANOMALY."

38:14.814 --> 38:17.730
HAYDEN: HOLD THE WORK.
SOMEONE'S COMING THROUGH.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.080
GABRIEL: FROM WHERE?

38:20.123 --> 38:22.909
LOOKS LIKE NAKARA.

38:24.214 --> 38:26.391
WE NEED SOME
DISCIPLES IN HERE.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.393
CLARKE: DON'T MOVE!

38:28.436 --> 38:30.046
CLARKE.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.312
THEY'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR YOU.

38:34.355 --> 38:35.704
WOMAN: THE KEY. IT'S HER.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.445
GABRIEL?

38:37.489 --> 38:39.360
- IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- WHERE ARE THE OTHERS?

38:39.404 --> 38:41.754
BELLAMY? OCTAVIA? ECHO?

38:41.797 --> 38:43.973
OCTAVIA AND ECHO ARE HERE.

38:44.017 --> 38:46.889
BUT I'M SORRY.

38:46.933 --> 38:48.413
BELLAMY'S DEAD.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.351
SEPULCHER CHAMBER.

39:15.918 --> 39:17.833
COMPUTER VOICE:
ACCESS GRANTED.

39:45.731 --> 39:50.083
FROM THE ASHES,
THROUGH THE BRIDGE

39:50.126 --> 39:52.564
THE SHEPHERD WILL RISE.

40:19.895 --> 40:21.114
YOU AGAIN?

40:21.157 --> 40:24.683
ANDERS, MY SHEPHERD.

40:25.858 --> 40:27.816
PLEASE CALL ME BILL.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.339
BILL.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.432
UHH!

40:37.043 --> 40:38.740
IF YOU'VE WOKEN ME
THIS EARLY,

40:38.784 --> 40:41.395
I SUSPECT
YOU HAVE NEWS.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.615
HAVE WE CRACKED
THE CODE?

40:43.658 --> 40:44.964
HAS THE WAR BEGUN?

40:45.007 --> 40:47.357
NO, NOT YET, SIR.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.881
BUT...

40:48.924 --> 40:51.666
WE HAVE THE KEY.
