01:43.233 --> 01:44.669
Hey.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.281
I told you we'd get
up here together.

01:47.324 --> 01:50.762
And it only took an entire
lifetime of training.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.242
Told ya.

01:52.286 --> 01:54.114
All right.
We are lucky enough

01:54.157 --> 01:55.593
to be the crew that puts
the first piece

01:55.637 --> 01:57.508
of the International
Space Station in orbit.

01:57.552 --> 01:59.162
Stratton,

01:59.206 --> 02:00.424
you ready to take us
to our coordinates?

02:00.468 --> 02:01.730
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.166
You're showing good GPCs
in your OP 2s?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.646
- Yep.
- Will you be ready

02:04.689 --> 02:06.778
to start the maneuver
for payload bay door opening?

02:06.822 --> 02:08.345
Reynolds,

02:08.389 --> 02:10.173
do you have any idea
how many times

02:10.217 --> 02:11.783
I've practiced this
in the simulator?

02:11.827 --> 02:14.134
Hey, we are not
in the simulator anymore.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.613
I got it.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.661
Sorry.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.315
Once a pilot.

02:21.358 --> 02:22.968
I promise,

02:23.012 --> 02:25.406
I'm gonna make you proud
up here.

Addison?

03:07.883 --> 03:08.840
both: Addison.

03:08.884 --> 03:11.016
Hello? Addison?

03:11.060 --> 03:13.018
Are--hi.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.672
Oat milk, three sugars.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.718
- Did you locate Ben?
- No.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.328
But the system is back up
and running,

03:18.372 --> 03:21.244
so it should only be a matter
of time before--

03:21.288 --> 03:22.854
what--what happened?

03:22.898 --> 03:24.378
Did somebody break in?

03:24.421 --> 03:25.944
You don't think that
the people who did this--

03:25.988 --> 03:28.077
No, I did this.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.557
- You?
- Yeah.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.254
W-why?

03:31.298 --> 03:33.213
I found Ben's phone.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.649
He left me a message
before he leaped.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.041
Telling you
to trash your apartment?

03:36.085 --> 03:38.261
No. Telling me that
there were gonna be things

03:38.305 --> 03:39.654
that I found out
about what he did

03:39.697 --> 03:40.785
that wouldn't make sense to me.

03:40.829 --> 03:42.831
Like any of this
actually makes sense.

03:42.874 --> 03:45.050
Okay. Okay, okay.
But--but then why this?

03:45.094 --> 03:46.661
Well, I figured if he could
be hiding one thing,

03:46.704 --> 03:48.097
then he could be
hiding another.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.359
And is he?

03:49.403 --> 03:51.448
I found this flash drive
in the bookshelf.

03:51.492 --> 03:53.450
- So what's on it?
- I was about to find out.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.847
Password encrypted.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.370
I mean, not really
a surprise there.

04:00.414 --> 04:01.937
Can you crack it?

04:01.980 --> 04:03.373
Maybe, but I don't know.

04:03.417 --> 04:05.593
That's--that's really
more of a Jenn thing.

04:07.377 --> 04:09.249
Did you get any sleep
at all last night?

04:09.292 --> 04:10.380
God, I just don't understand.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.381
I thought we were
in this together.

04:11.425 --> 04:14.254
- We are.
- No, me and Ben.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.472
Right. Yeah, sorry.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.387
We met at Quantum Leap.

04:17.431 --> 04:18.562
We fell in love.

04:18.606 --> 04:22.262
We worked side by side
for years.

04:22.305 --> 04:25.613
We had to try to not talk
about work when we came home.

04:25.656 --> 04:29.399
It felt like our entire
life was this project.

04:30.792 --> 04:35.318
And now there's this
whole other part to it,

04:35.362 --> 04:37.538
this whole other part
of himself

04:37.581 --> 04:39.757
that he kept from me.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.021
And I'm just really
having a hard time

04:43.065 --> 04:44.414
coming to terms
with the fact that maybe

04:44.458 --> 04:46.590
this was never really ours.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.288
Uh, I don't know. It--

04:48.331 --> 04:50.246
it's hard to explain.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.682
I mean, I think you did

04:51.726 --> 04:53.467
a pretty good job
of explaining it.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.386
Magic found something.

04:59.429 --> 05:00.561
Okay.

05:03.128 --> 05:05.000
I was able to recover
this image last night.

05:05.043 --> 05:08.046
The woman helping Ben
is Janis Calavicci.

05:08.090 --> 05:09.134
Calavicci?

05:09.178 --> 05:10.266
Like Al Calavicci's daughter?

05:10.310 --> 05:11.746
Wait, you knew
about this last night

05:11.789 --> 05:13.313
and you didn't say anything?
- You had a lot going on.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.445
- Did Ben ever mention her?
- No.

05:15.489 --> 05:16.751
What else aren't
you telling me?

05:16.794 --> 05:18.143
Addison.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.798
Janis Calavicci is
a brilliant astrophysicist.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.844
Her father ran Quantum Leap
for years.

05:22.887 --> 05:25.803
She knows as much
about this project as anyone.

05:25.847 --> 05:27.936
It makes sense Ben would go
to her if he needed help.

05:27.979 --> 05:30.634
But, okay, what if it's
the other way around?

05:30.678 --> 05:32.680
Maybe Janis is the one
that's behind all of this.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.335
Exactly. Okay, I'll ask Ben
as soon as you locate him.

05:35.378 --> 05:36.988
It actually might
help jog his memory.

05:37.032 --> 05:38.642
No.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.863
Ben not remembering anything
right now is a good thing.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.081
Come again?

05:43.125 --> 05:44.953
We need to--
and I don't believe it,

05:44.996 --> 05:46.650
but we have
to at least consider

05:46.694 --> 05:49.044
the possibility that Ben
has been co-opted by Janis.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.481
We have to at least
consider it.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.004
And if his memory
suddenly comes back

05:53.048 --> 05:55.093
and his plan was to do
terrible things the whole time,

05:55.137 --> 05:56.747
there's not a lot we could do
to stop it.

05:56.791 --> 05:59.837
The only safeguard we have
is him not remembering

05:59.881 --> 06:02.013
why he leaped
or what his agenda is.

06:02.057 --> 06:05.103
So until we figure out
what the hell is going on,

06:05.147 --> 06:07.149
you have to go out
of your way to make sure

06:07.192 --> 06:09.194
we don't jog his memory, okay?

06:09.238 --> 06:11.414
No. Not okay.

06:11.458 --> 06:14.243
I do not agree
with this plan of attack.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.027
I'm sorry you feel that way.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.595
But I'm not asking.
- Okay, um, look.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.205
None of us really got
a lot of sleep last night,

06:20.249 --> 06:22.033
so maybe we should
just put a pin in this.

06:22.077 --> 06:24.427
I've got a lock on Ben.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.646
Where is he?

06:25.689 --> 06:28.518
Well--holy ship.

06:28.562 --> 06:30.477
You're not gonna believe this.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.914
Ben is on the space shuttle
"Atlantis,"

06:32.957 --> 06:35.264
March 7, 1998.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.748
I noticed that you didn't
mention the little thumb drive

06:40.791 --> 06:42.358
that you found this morning
or the message

06:42.402 --> 06:43.664
that Ben left for you.

06:43.707 --> 06:45.056
Look, I need to know
what Ben was thinking.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.449
I need to know
what's on this drive.

06:46.493 --> 06:47.407
Well, then you should've
given it to Jenn.

06:47.450 --> 06:48.799
They don't trust him.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.192
Actually, I think that
they're trying to give him

06:50.235 --> 06:51.585
the benefit of the doubt.

06:51.628 --> 06:54.196
Look, I need to know
what he was thinking.

06:54.239 --> 06:55.589
I need to see it first.

06:55.632 --> 06:57.199
You remember this morning
when you were like,

06:57.242 --> 06:59.244
"oh, I--I thought we were
in this together,"

06:59.288 --> 07:00.724
and I thought you were
talking about you and me,

07:00.768 --> 07:02.378
but you were actually
talking about you and Ben,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.380
and I was quietly mortified,
but I recovered

07:04.424 --> 07:05.686
really gracefully?
- Ian.

07:05.729 --> 07:07.644
Look,
splitting into two teams

07:07.688 --> 07:09.080
right now is a mistake.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.473
And if Ben were here,
he wouldn't stand--

07:10.517 --> 07:12.693
Well, he's not here.

07:12.736 --> 07:14.869
Look, please just
unlock the drive--

07:14.912 --> 07:16.479
for me.

07:16.523 --> 07:17.611
Please.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.232
- You okay in there, David?
- Yep. Yeah.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.930
You just, uh, can't
rush this sort of thing.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.497
First time's always
a little tricky.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.933
Mm-hmm.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.675
Oh, thank God.

07:38.719 --> 07:39.763
Are you okay?

07:39.807 --> 07:41.939
I'm in a space shuttle.

07:41.983 --> 07:43.767
I know.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.290
I thought I was supposed
to get pulled back

07:45.334 --> 07:46.640
to 2022 when I left.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.206
Yeah, that didn't work.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.730
Do we know why?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.775
We're working on it.

07:51.819 --> 07:53.211
However,
the team is fairly confident

07:53.255 --> 07:55.213
we should be able to get you
back on the next leap.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.606
Well, I'd be more upset,

07:56.650 --> 07:58.652
but space shuttle.

07:58.695 --> 08:01.568
It's very cool.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.612
Who am I this time?

08:02.656 --> 08:04.788
Uh, your name's David Tamura.

08:04.832 --> 08:06.486
He is--
- Tamura?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.226
Wait a minute.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.880
<i>Do you remember him?</i>

08:09.924 --> 08:12.404
<i>It--David Tamura.</i>

08:12.448 --> 08:14.494
- Uh-oh. <i>
- I--I idolized him</i>

08:14.537 --> 08:15.756
when I was growing up.

08:15.799 --> 08:17.975
He immigrated to the U.S.
from Japan

08:18.019 --> 08:20.587
and became an astronaut,
and I immigrated from Korea

08:20.630 --> 08:22.719
and wanted
to become an astronaut.

08:24.721 --> 08:27.985
I immigrated from Korea
when I was a kid.

08:28.029 --> 08:29.378
Yeah.

08:29.421 --> 08:30.684
I'm remembering.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.512
Hey, Addison,
take him away from this.

08:32.555 --> 08:34.949
<i>We don't want him--</i>
- Um, that's fantastic, Ben.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.559
What else do you remember?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.169
Addison!

08:38.213 --> 08:39.606
Um...

08:41.564 --> 08:43.523
Nothing.
- Okay.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.263
- Except--oh, God.
- Yes?

08:45.307 --> 08:47.614
David Tamura dies
on his first mission--

08:47.657 --> 08:49.267
this mission.
- We know.

08:49.311 --> 08:52.140
Ziggy says there's a 92% chance
you're here to prevent that.

08:52.183 --> 08:53.707
Okay. How do I do that?

08:53.750 --> 08:56.057
Well, NASA never released
the cause of death publicly,

08:56.100 --> 08:59.190
so we're waiting on
the classified mission report.

08:59.234 --> 09:01.671
Until then, we just have
to keep you out of harm's way.

09:01.715 --> 09:03.064
Okay. Yeah.

09:03.107 --> 09:04.456
Why do you think I'm
hanging out in the bathroom?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.067
They expect me to know things,
and there's, like,

09:06.110 --> 09:07.634
a million switches out there,
and if I hit the wrong one--

09:07.677 --> 09:09.113
Ben.

09:09.157 --> 09:11.420
That's why I'm here.

09:11.463 --> 09:12.813
I got you.

09:15.076 --> 09:16.381
There he is.

09:16.425 --> 09:18.383
Hey, can you start
the post-insertion checklist

09:18.427 --> 09:19.689
and get the PLB floodlights on?

09:19.733 --> 09:21.952
Sure can.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.432
Ben.

09:26.522 --> 09:28.306
Okay.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.526
Third dial from the left
and then right on the bottom.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.659
Okay.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.581
What'd I do?

09:41.624 --> 09:42.843
That wasn't you.

09:42.886 --> 09:45.149
Payload doors are jamming.

09:47.717 --> 09:49.414
Oh, no.
If the payload shifted,

09:49.458 --> 09:50.590
it could be blocking the--

10:28.671 --> 10:29.759
Report.

10:29.803 --> 10:31.282
You guys okay down there?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.720
<i>A little banged up,
but we're okay.</i>

10:33.763 --> 10:35.504
<i>How about you two?</i>

10:37.680 --> 10:39.160
Reynolds!

10:46.123 --> 10:47.298
You all right?

10:47.342 --> 10:48.778
Yeah.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.780
Candace made me promise
to take care of him up here.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.434
- Candace?
- His wife?

10:52.477 --> 10:53.696
Oh, right. Candace.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.263
Yeah, love Candace.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.960
She didn't want him
to leave again,

10:57.004 --> 10:59.789
but he wanted
to be up here for me.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.791
My first flight, his last.

11:01.835 --> 11:03.314
He's gonna be okay.

11:03.358 --> 11:06.796
You know, he picked me
out of thousands of applicants.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.755
Trained with me
day in and day out

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
for the better part
of a decade.

11:11.148 --> 11:13.324
Ten years of him in my ear,

11:13.368 --> 11:14.891
"Told ya. Told ya."

11:14.935 --> 11:17.111
- Told ya?
- Oh, you've heard him.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.287
Every time he was right
and I was wrong,

11:19.330 --> 11:21.289
which, annoyingly,
was most of the time,

11:21.332 --> 11:25.423
he'd always throw
that "told ya" at me.

11:25.467 --> 11:26.903
So aggravating at first,

11:26.947 --> 11:31.386
but now--
now when we really need him...

11:33.040 --> 11:35.129
We were just supposed
to do this together.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.262
He's stable.

11:38.306 --> 11:40.700
Pretty massive concussion
and a nasty cut on his head,

11:40.743 --> 11:42.919
but I think that's
the worst of it.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.008
Max, you were right.

11:45.052 --> 11:46.401
Payload shifted somehow,

11:46.444 --> 11:48.185
and when it made contact
with the doors,

11:48.229 --> 11:50.666
it triggered the thrusters
to fire on the ISS module.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.929
- How bad is it?
- Could be better.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.757
The explosion ruptured
our O2 tank.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.193
We switched to backup,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.065
but that means we only have
six hours of oxygen left.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.544
Six hours?
That doesn't seem like enough--

11:59.588 --> 12:01.633
We'll be fine.
I just need to talk to Houston,

12:01.677 --> 12:03.026
figure out our next move.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.898
Max, I could use your help
on the flight deck.

12:04.941 --> 12:07.030
You got it.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.858
I don't suppose
I can leap now?

12:08.902 --> 12:11.818
Not yet,
but Ziggy says nothing changed.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.123
But I survived the explosion.

12:13.167 --> 12:15.212
You don't control
the leap, Ben.

12:15.256 --> 12:17.171
Okay, so if this is not
how he dies,

12:17.214 --> 12:19.173
something worse happens
up here?

12:19.216 --> 12:22.263
We need to find out
how David dies now.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.578
Magic.

12:33.622 --> 12:34.623
Hello, Beth.

12:34.666 --> 12:37.060
Oh, this is a nice surprise.

12:38.670 --> 12:40.237
How are you?

12:40.281 --> 12:41.630
Good.

12:41.673 --> 12:44.198
I'm sorry I haven't come by
since Al's funeral.

12:44.241 --> 12:45.634
I've been meaning to, I just--

12:45.677 --> 12:47.331
Don't apologize.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.420
I know how busy you are.

12:49.464 --> 12:52.467
So what brings you by?

12:52.510 --> 12:54.512
I need to talk to Janis.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.298
She's in trouble.

12:57.341 --> 12:59.604
I need to find her.
I figured you could help me.

12:59.648 --> 13:00.823
What kind of trouble?

13:00.867 --> 13:02.477
The kind I can't
tell you about.

13:05.132 --> 13:07.961
The truth is, I haven't
seen her in over a year.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.919
After Al died,
she just withdrew

13:09.963 --> 13:11.442
from me, her friends, her life.

13:11.486 --> 13:12.574
I tried to get her help,

13:12.617 --> 13:14.010
but it only pushed her
further away.

13:14.054 --> 13:15.055
I'm sorry to hear that.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.578
I have a daughter.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.841
I know how hard it is
to try to love them,

13:18.885 --> 13:20.451
protect them
at the same time.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.627
But this is serious.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.499
Magic.

13:24.542 --> 13:27.458
Did something go wrong
with the project?

13:27.502 --> 13:29.112
You can tell me.

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
It's good to see you, Beth.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.859
You hear from Janis,
let me know.

13:44.998 --> 13:46.695
- Hey. How'd it go? <i>
- Fine.</i>

13:46.738 --> 13:47.827
Everything okay?

13:47.870 --> 13:49.306
<i>Make sure we're ready to go.</i>

13:49.350 --> 13:52.179
<i>If I'm right,
this could be our best shot.</i>

14:12.547 --> 14:13.809
How goes?

14:13.853 --> 14:15.985
Um, I-I mean...

14:16.029 --> 14:17.465
It goes.

14:17.508 --> 14:19.249
We just got a deluge
of files from NASA,

14:19.293 --> 14:22.078
so there's some progress there.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.384
Was that Alex in here?

14:23.427 --> 14:24.385
Hm?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.823
Oh, um,

14:27.867 --> 14:29.042
yeah--yeah, no, she is--

14:29.085 --> 14:30.826
she's just helping me implement

14:30.870 --> 14:34.351
some tricky software
into the new Ziggy interface.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.353
I didn't know Alex was
on your software team.

14:36.397 --> 14:37.833
Mm-hmm.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.922
Didn't she help develop
our PTP encryption program?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.141
Yep.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.317
Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.058
You know what's
the worst thing about Ben

14:45.101 --> 14:47.234
not being here right now?

14:47.277 --> 14:49.758
He was kind of the guy
that held us all together.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.803
You know, when Magic
and I would worry too much

14:51.847 --> 14:53.501
about secrecy and security,

14:53.544 --> 14:55.111
and Addison would get
bogged down

14:55.155 --> 14:57.200
with operational details,
or you'd go down

14:57.244 --> 14:58.723
a rabbit hole chasing
a piece of code

14:58.767 --> 15:00.943
that ultimately didn't matter.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.553
Ben always had this
magical ability

15:02.597 --> 15:04.033
to pull us all together
and get us marching

15:04.077 --> 15:06.383
in the same direction.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.212
All of us working
towards the same goal...

15:09.256 --> 15:11.127
together.
- Jenn. Look, I--

15:11.171 --> 15:13.042
I hate seeing Magic
and Addison at odds.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.783
Ben's not here
to smooth things over,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.654
so it's up to us,
you and me,

15:16.698 --> 15:18.439
to keep this thing
from falling apart.

15:18.482 --> 15:21.224
I'm not telling you to hand
that drive over right now,

15:21.268 --> 15:24.836
but maybe the person
who gave it to you should.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.969
Talk to her.

15:31.365 --> 15:33.323
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

15:36.065 --> 15:38.241
Finally.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.374
You know,
mentioning David triggered

15:40.417 --> 15:42.071
a memory from my childhood.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.464
Shouldn't you be
doing more of that,

15:43.507 --> 15:45.379
like, using your handheld
device to show me things,

15:45.422 --> 15:46.989
present stimuli from my life

15:47.033 --> 15:48.686
that might trigger
more memories?

15:50.906 --> 15:53.735
They don't want me to.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.389
They?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.783
Ah.

15:58.827 --> 16:01.873
In case I did this
for all the wrong reasons,

16:01.917 --> 16:04.485
have some big, evil plan.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.966
God, honestly, I wish
you were on this side of it.

16:07.009 --> 16:08.271
You are always a lot
better at dealing

16:08.315 --> 16:09.620
with the politics of it all.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.144
Trust me, I wish.

16:11.187 --> 16:13.189
But between you and me,
I think we both know

16:13.233 --> 16:14.843
who's better suited
to be the astronaut.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.149
Oh, come on.

16:16.192 --> 16:19.239
You're doing...
better than expected.

16:19.282 --> 16:20.631
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:22.459 --> 16:25.071
For what it's worth,
I get it.

16:25.114 --> 16:26.681
You get what?

16:26.724 --> 16:29.858
Keeping me in the dark until
they figure out why I leapt.

16:29.901 --> 16:32.208
I hate it, but if I was
on that other side,

16:32.252 --> 16:35.124
I'd probably be making
the same call, honestly.

16:35.168 --> 16:37.909
Yeah.
You would, wouldn't you?

16:37.953 --> 16:40.651
Since we can't talk about me,
can we talk about you?

16:43.698 --> 16:46.048
Who's the lucky guy?

16:46.092 --> 16:47.528
Do I know him?

16:50.096 --> 16:52.054
Uh, you wouldn't
remember him.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.708
Fair enough.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.666
When's the big day?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.146
Six months.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.540
I hope I'm back by then.

17:00.845 --> 17:01.803
You better be.

17:05.546 --> 17:06.851
Oh, good.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.201
We got the classified
mission report from NASA.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.203
Okay.

17:10.246 --> 17:12.031
How did David die?

17:12.074 --> 17:13.684
It was on a spacewalk.

17:13.728 --> 17:15.469
He got hit by debris.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.166
Okay. Well, this is easy.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.689
As long as I don't leave
the ship,

17:18.733 --> 17:20.648
then I can leap, right?

17:20.691 --> 17:23.172
David, do you want
to get up here?

17:23.912 --> 17:26.045
The explosion knocked out
long-distance comms.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.524
We can't contact Houston.

17:27.568 --> 17:28.612
Okay.

17:28.656 --> 17:30.179
With Reynolds out,
I'm in charge,

17:30.223 --> 17:31.963
and I'm making the call
to return to Kennedy

17:32.007 --> 17:33.095
while our window's still open.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.183
Yes. Love this plan.

17:34.227 --> 17:35.358
Thing is, we can't land

17:35.402 --> 17:36.664
until we close
the payload bay doors.

17:36.707 --> 17:38.883
Totally.
Yeah, I know that. Yeah.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.711
But in order to do that,
we need to jettison

17:40.755 --> 17:42.017
that damaged ISS module.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.845
The explosion fried
our remote capabilities.

17:43.888 --> 17:46.065
And the Canadarm got banged
up and isn't responding.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.718
So we need you
to get out there

17:47.762 --> 17:50.460
and toggle
the manual release lever.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.375
- You need me to--
- Suit up.

17:52.419 --> 17:54.290
We need you to do
an emergency spacewalk.

18:00.775 --> 18:01.993
Okay,
according to the records,

18:02.037 --> 18:04.126
David was struck by debris
at 21:54 UTC,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.606
which gives you 90 minutes.

18:05.649 --> 18:08.391
Now, if you can get out there,
jettison the ISS module,

18:08.435 --> 18:10.437
and get back in,
you should be good.

18:10.480 --> 18:11.438
Let's get that helmet on.

18:11.481 --> 18:12.787
Start the pressurization tests.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.136
How long do those tests take?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.878
I don't know, 20 minutes?

18:16.921 --> 18:19.010
I'm good.
Uh, we don't need those tests.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.273
Pass, please.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.362
Sorry, David, we gotta
do this by the book.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.451
Do we?
We have six hours of O2 left.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.669
I understand needing
to be careful,

18:25.713 --> 18:27.454
but I need
to get out there now.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.285
Reynolds would do the checks.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.986
No. David's right.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.683
By the end of this,
seconds are gonna count.

18:39.727 --> 18:41.076
He's not gonna
be out there long.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.817
Let's get him in the airlock.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.166
Thank you.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.863
Nice.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.914
You know what Reynolds
would say right now?

18:54.220 --> 18:55.699
Remind me.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.876
He'd get that serious,
noble look in his eye.

18:58.920 --> 19:01.140
He'd lean in close and say,
"You have trained

19:01.183 --> 19:03.316
"for every possibility
except for the one

19:03.359 --> 19:04.447
you're about to encounter."

19:04.491 --> 19:06.188
When you're up here for real,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.451
it's not about following
flowcharts and checklists.

19:08.495 --> 19:11.324
It's about trusting your gut.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.803
Stay fluid.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.196
Stay open.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.937
Stay safe.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.158
Smart guy.

19:19.201 --> 19:20.681
Yeah.

19:20.724 --> 19:22.639
He's got his moments.

19:23.727 --> 19:24.859
Let's get you out there.

19:30.734 --> 19:35.609
<i>♪ This is Ground Control
to Major Tom ♪</i>

19:35.652 --> 19:39.047
<i>♪ I'm stepping
through the door ♪</i>

19:40.483 --> 19:46.054
<i>♪ And I'm floating
in a most peculiar way ♪</i>

19:47.490 --> 19:53.235
<i>♪ And the stars look
very different today ♪</i>

19:53.279 --> 19:55.411
Wow.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.152
This is--

19:58.806 --> 20:01.200
I didn't know
you could be terrified

20:01.243 --> 20:04.028
and amazed at the same time.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.856
This is crazy.

20:07.467 --> 20:11.862
I mean,
I know I'm not really here,

20:11.906 --> 20:13.212
but this--

20:15.126 --> 20:17.520
This is incredible.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.000
Can we focus here?

20:19.043 --> 20:20.610
I'm on a bit of a clock.

20:20.654 --> 20:22.003
Yeah. Right.

20:23.439 --> 20:25.267
Open that panel.

20:25.311 --> 20:26.399
Thank you.

20:28.314 --> 20:29.576
Hey.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.142
I was just checking the feed.

20:31.186 --> 20:32.318
Ben was remembering things,

20:32.361 --> 20:33.754
and Addison had him
leaning into it.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.059
I know. I told her to stop.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.931
And she didn't.

20:36.974 --> 20:38.454
You should have
killed the connection

20:38.498 --> 20:39.934
and pulled her
from the imaging chamber.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.370
Well, I don't think that
would have gone over well.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.590
Look, I didn't
create this situation.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.982
Neither did she.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.421
- What is it?

20:48.464 --> 20:49.770
Your plan worked.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.424
About 20 minutes after
you left Beth's house,

20:51.467 --> 20:52.773
she called Janis.

20:52.816 --> 20:55.645
So now we have Janis' phone
and an address.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.081
We have an address
for Janis?

20:57.125 --> 20:58.779
Where is she?
- Small house in Pasadena.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.302
Phone's still there.
- Let's move.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.223
Okay, good.
Now prime those two levers.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.790
How are we doing on time?

21:09.833 --> 21:11.574
Still have ten minutes,
and we're almost--

21:13.794 --> 21:15.578
Radio that you're
ready to jettison.

21:15.622 --> 21:17.928
Stratton,
I am ready to jettison.

21:17.972 --> 21:19.669
That's great news, David.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.105
We're ready in here.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.672
Go for jettison.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.326
All right.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.458
Flip that red switch.

21:27.286 --> 21:28.983
Here goes nothing.

21:35.250 --> 21:37.339
<i>Great work, David.
Come on inside,</i>

21:37.383 --> 21:39.472
<i>and we'll get these payload
bay doors closed.</i>

21:39.515 --> 21:41.212
Thought you'd never ask.

21:43.737 --> 21:45.478
Ben. The debris.

21:45.521 --> 21:46.827
It's early.
- What?

21:46.870 --> 21:48.176
The records must've
been a little off.

21:48.219 --> 21:50.309
- A little off?
- You need to get down.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.484
Now!

21:59.405 --> 22:00.580
<i>Report.</i>

22:00.623 --> 22:02.973
You okay out there?

22:03.017 --> 22:04.105
Yeah.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.499
I just dodged
some space debris.

22:06.542 --> 22:07.717
That was close.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.197
But I'm okay.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.372
You're alive.

22:10.416 --> 22:11.591
That was amazing.

22:11.634 --> 22:13.810
Now I can leap.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.334
You don't control
the leap, Ben.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.639
Yeah, sure. Fine.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.641
I can be more zen about it,
but, I mean,

22:18.685 --> 22:20.295
David is very much alive.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.514
I dodged the debris.

22:21.557 --> 22:22.515
We're good, no?

22:22.558 --> 22:23.690
Okay. All right.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.520
N-no.
No, no, no, no, no.

22:27.563 --> 22:29.217
That--that can't be true.
- What?

22:29.260 --> 22:31.741
Ben, it says because
the debris missed you,

22:31.785 --> 22:33.700
it damaged some thermal
protection tiles.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.092
- So what? They're just--
- No.

22:35.136 --> 22:37.225
When the shuttle hits
the atmosphere on reentry,

22:37.268 --> 22:38.879
the heat shields fail.

22:38.922 --> 22:42.143
Ziggy says there's 100% chance
of the entire team dying now.

22:51.761 --> 22:52.980
Looks quiet.

22:53.023 --> 22:54.111
I wonder if Janis
is still there.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.417
I was thinking
I'd just knock,

22:55.461 --> 22:57.419
see if she's home.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.073
Hey.

22:59.116 --> 23:02.032
You need to be more delicate
with Addison.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.512
You think she's right,

23:03.556 --> 23:05.340
that we should be trying
to get Ben to remember?

23:05.384 --> 23:07.211
No.
But she's feeling

23:07.255 --> 23:08.778
pretty out of control
right now.

23:08.822 --> 23:09.910
We are not helping.

23:09.953 --> 23:12.086
How do you mean?

23:12.129 --> 23:14.349
She didn't choose
to be the hologram.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.003
She didn't choose
for her fiancé

23:16.046 --> 23:17.613
to leap back in time
without telling her.

23:17.657 --> 23:19.180
She didn't choose
to be in the middle

23:19.223 --> 23:20.442
of a scandal that could
rewrite the past

23:20.486 --> 23:22.662
in ways we can't even imagine.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.098
It's a lot.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.276
I know this
is a military project,

23:28.319 --> 23:30.104
but we're a team, Magic.

23:30.147 --> 23:32.236
We're supposed to be, anyway.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.543
So, you know,
cut her some slack.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.502
Start letting her
be a part of the decisions

23:36.545 --> 23:38.591
instead of on
the receiving end of them.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.595
What?

23:42.638 --> 23:44.727
You sure Ben didn't
leap into you?

23:46.468 --> 23:48.644
That might be the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.620
Everything okay?

24:07.663 --> 24:09.622
Not really,
but they're getting him

24:09.665 --> 24:13.016
out of his spacesuit right now,
so he's okay for a minute.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.498
Where are we with the drive?

24:16.542 --> 24:19.719
Well, um, the encryption
is next level.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.461
I mean, it would take accessing
all of the computational power

24:22.504 --> 24:24.288
in the building
in order to crack it,

24:24.332 --> 24:26.639
which is something that
we cannot do very quietly.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.510
Okay, look,
there's got to be a way.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.078
Oh, um, there is, actually.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.428
It's called asking
our friends for help.

24:34.690 --> 24:37.432
Look, I-I don't think
that you're holding

24:37.476 --> 24:40.348
the drive back because
you don't trust Magic and Jenn.

24:40.391 --> 24:43.351
I think it's Ben
that you're worried about.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.180
I mean, something on this drive
could be incriminating,

24:46.223 --> 24:48.530
and that's scary
to think about.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.492
I'm going back in.

24:55.450 --> 24:57.408
Those tiles get
banged up all the time.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.019
It's fine.
- No, Ben.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.281
They don't know this,
but a shuttle

25:00.324 --> 25:02.631
with this kind of debris
damage disintegrated

25:02.675 --> 25:04.851
upon reentry in 2003.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.461
That damage is substantial.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.681
We can't attempt a reentry
without repairing them first.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.205
We have four and a half hours
of oxygen left,

25:11.248 --> 25:13.555
and only another 20 minutes
to get in position

25:13.599 --> 25:15.078
or we lose our window
to Kennedy.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.776
So we can either attempt
reentry now

25:16.819 --> 25:18.168
and hope for the best,

25:18.212 --> 25:20.736
or we can suffocate up here
arguing about tiles.

25:20.780 --> 25:21.781
There's another option.

25:23.434 --> 25:24.305
Mir.

25:24.348 --> 25:26.089
The Russians?

25:26.133 --> 25:28.527
Their space station should
have plenty of O2 to spare.

25:28.570 --> 25:30.703
We top up, fix the tiles,
and head home.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.966
That's insane
for a thousand reasons.

25:33.009 --> 25:35.838
No, it's not. Ziggy says
there's an 87% chance

25:35.882 --> 25:38.232
that you all survive
if you go to Mir right now.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.233
Mir gets my vote.

25:39.276 --> 25:40.887
Absolutely not.

25:40.930 --> 25:42.976
We should attempt deorbit burn
now while we can.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.107
This isn't a democracy.

25:44.151 --> 25:45.239
We've lost contact
with Houston,

25:45.282 --> 25:46.414
and I'm acting commander.

25:46.457 --> 25:48.285
I make the call.
We're going to Mir.

25:48.329 --> 25:49.983
Like hell we are.

25:50.026 --> 25:51.419
Reynolds, you okay?

25:51.462 --> 25:54.030
No, but you're about
to get us killed up here.

25:54.074 --> 25:55.945
Look, a lot has
happened since you--

25:55.989 --> 25:57.077
I have this under control--

25:57.120 --> 25:58.905
We are not about
to go running

25:58.948 --> 26:00.515
to the Russians for help.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.952
Do you know how embarrassing
that would be to the program?

26:02.996 --> 26:05.825
I think losing a shuttle
on reentry would be worse.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.217
We're going home.

26:12.788 --> 26:14.268
Coffee's still warm.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.099
Looks like she was smart enough
to ditch the phone and leave.

26:19.142 --> 26:20.883
A risk we had to take.

26:20.927 --> 26:22.885
Maybe she left something
behind that could tell us

26:22.929 --> 26:24.278
what she and Ben were up to.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.628
Nothing looks out
of the ordinary,

26:26.672 --> 26:28.761
except for an unnatural
love of Pottery Barn.

26:32.982 --> 26:33.940
Give me a hand.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.873
Ten minutes
until our window closes.

26:53.916 --> 26:55.048
Look, I know you're nervous,

26:55.091 --> 26:56.919
but Max and I have
been up here before.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.834
The bird maybe gets knocked
around a little bit more

26:58.878 --> 27:00.140
than you like,
but it's designed for it.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.794
The tile damage is severe.

27:01.837 --> 27:04.579
Like you said,
this is not a democracy.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.799
Now, look, kid.
We're gonna be fine, okay?

27:06.842 --> 27:08.496
What am I gonna say to you
when this is over?

27:08.539 --> 27:10.367
This is not
a "told ya" moment.

27:10.411 --> 27:12.108
The tiles are messed up.

27:12.152 --> 27:13.327
We're leaking O2.

27:13.370 --> 27:15.155
The Canadarm isn't working.

27:15.198 --> 27:16.939
And that's just
the stuff we've noticed.

27:16.983 --> 27:19.202
The safe play
is to rendezvous with Mir.

27:19.246 --> 27:21.335
Samantha, get in the chair.

27:21.378 --> 27:22.728
I know you still look at me

27:22.771 --> 27:25.469
like I'm some 20-year-old
rookie sometimes,

27:25.513 --> 27:28.864
but I am right about this.

27:28.908 --> 27:33.173
Please, I need you
to just listen to me.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.654
Just--just see what I--

27:37.481 --> 27:39.614
Candace made me promise
to get you home safe--

27:39.658 --> 27:40.484
Enough!

27:40.528 --> 27:41.529
Now get in that chair

27:41.572 --> 27:43.836
and start our deorbit burn.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.667
Stratton!

27:50.320 --> 27:52.801
Get her back here now.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.722
Ben, you need to stop this.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.202
How?

28:02.245 --> 28:03.986
Do what you do best.

28:04.030 --> 28:05.988
Get them all rowing
in the same direction.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.515
- How can I help?
- You should go back up there.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.605
- Why?
- Plausible deniability.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.259
I'm gonna open
the payload bay doors

28:16.303 --> 28:17.391
and lock them out
of the system.

28:17.434 --> 28:20.176
It'll force them
to abort reentry.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.222
- You--
- Get up there, David.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.964
I don't want you court
martialed if we survive this.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.010
She's gonna open
the payload bay doors

28:28.054 --> 28:29.229
and force you to abort, sir.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.621
Ben, what are you doing?

28:30.665 --> 28:31.884
She's trying to save you.

28:31.927 --> 28:33.320
You are in
a diminished capacity.

28:33.363 --> 28:34.756
You have a concussion.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.280
You were unconscious up until
about 15 minutes ago.

28:37.324 --> 28:38.455
You are not of sound mind.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.979
You should not be
in that chair right now.

28:40.022 --> 28:42.242
Five minutes till
we lose our window.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.852
What did you always say?

28:43.896 --> 28:45.724
You're prepared
for every possibility

28:45.767 --> 28:47.551
except for the one
you're about to encounter.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.076
Stay fluid. Stay open.
Stay safe.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.687
She's only here because
I'm the one who fought for her.

28:52.731 --> 28:55.342
She's up here because you've
trained her to be the best.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.778
You've been side by side
with her

28:56.822 --> 28:58.345
for the better part
of a decade,

28:58.388 --> 28:59.781
teaching her
everything you know.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.088
Every "told ya"
making her better,

29:02.131 --> 29:05.656
getting her ready
for a moment just like this.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.485
And now she's willing
to risk her career and her life

29:08.529 --> 29:10.357
to convince you
that you are wrong.

29:10.400 --> 29:12.620
She sees something you don't.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.796
And just because
you don't see it right now,

29:14.840 --> 29:16.276
you gotta trust
that what she's doing

29:16.319 --> 29:18.104
is best for all of us.

29:18.147 --> 29:21.716
Because she's still
the Stratton you love,

29:21.760 --> 29:23.283
the Stratton that loves you.

29:25.285 --> 29:28.636
So please abort deorbit.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.205
Commander,
we need to begin our burn.

29:32.248 --> 29:33.815
Now.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.820
Abort.

29:40.256 --> 29:41.692
Sir?

29:41.736 --> 29:42.693
Abort.

29:48.874 --> 29:50.701
You two better be right
about this.

29:58.492 --> 29:59.885
Let's say Stratton can
get us into Mir's orbit--

29:59.928 --> 30:01.451
I've already mapped a course.

30:01.495 --> 30:03.671
I can get us there
in under an hour.

30:03.714 --> 30:05.194
- I really like her.
- Yeah.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.543
That solves problem one.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.807
But still, our long-range
comms are still out.

30:08.850 --> 30:11.026
If we can't talk to them,
we can't dock.

30:11.070 --> 30:13.246
Well, we can't just
pull up and honk the horn.

30:13.289 --> 30:14.595
Hey, when we're
on the ground,

30:14.638 --> 30:16.815
there's no way we're using
our massive,

30:16.858 --> 30:18.425
super-powerful comms, right?

30:18.468 --> 30:20.470
We must have high-power S band
on this thing too.

30:20.514 --> 30:22.516
High-power S band.
Great idea.

30:22.559 --> 30:23.517
Nice, Ben.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.258
That only works
line of sight.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.216
Someone would have to be
in the payload area,

30:27.260 --> 30:29.653
pointing the antenna
right at them.

30:35.529 --> 30:36.878
Oh, wait. Hold on.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.054
Um, there's probably
another way.

30:39.098 --> 30:41.056
You up for another
spacewalk, buddy?

30:42.928 --> 30:44.451
Excellent.

30:50.196 --> 30:52.502
You got to hand it to her.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.896
She doesn't skimp
on the processing power.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.767
That's Ben's handwriting.

30:56.811 --> 30:57.943
What do you think it means?

30:57.986 --> 30:59.596
I have no idea.

31:02.034 --> 31:04.079
Hey, she knows we're here.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.606
We better move fast.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.783
The computers are
password protected.

31:12.827 --> 31:15.656
Check the servers.
Make sure it's not bolted down.

31:15.699 --> 31:17.788
They are--and they're
modified torque screws.

31:17.832 --> 31:21.357
I am starting to like
this woman despite myself.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.751
I can pull out the screws
and remove the drive.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.100
Make it quick.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.716
Just admit it.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.022
You love spacewalks.

31:34.066 --> 31:35.589
I'm trying to work.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.591
Two in one day,
that's all I'm saying.

31:41.812 --> 31:43.597
Thank you.

31:43.640 --> 31:46.382
Uh, for which thing?

31:48.428 --> 31:52.562
For, uh, not giving up on me.

31:54.521 --> 31:56.044
For helping me.

31:57.437 --> 32:01.093
For helping the guy
that no one trusts.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.445
I trust you.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.490
You do?

32:07.534 --> 32:09.405
Yeah, Ben.

32:09.449 --> 32:11.799
I do.

32:19.154 --> 32:21.243
We're good.

32:23.680 --> 32:27.728
<i>"Atlantis," we're ready to
make that collect call to Mir.</i>

32:27.771 --> 32:29.556
Copy that. Stand by.

32:36.563 --> 32:37.781
Okay.

32:37.825 --> 32:40.915
I've got the antenna
pointed right at Mir.

32:40.959 --> 32:44.266
Best-case scenario,
from them acknowledging us

32:44.310 --> 32:46.181
to us connecting up
to the Russian O2,

32:46.225 --> 32:48.009
how long will that take?

32:48.053 --> 32:49.228
At least an hour.

32:49.271 --> 32:51.795
And how much oxygen
do we have left?

32:51.839 --> 32:52.883
Hour 15?

32:52.927 --> 32:54.276
So we have 15 minutes
for them

32:54.320 --> 32:57.018
to talk to us
or this is all for nothing?

33:02.676 --> 33:05.113
Mir, this is U.S.
Space Shuttle "Atlantis."

33:05.157 --> 33:06.810
Do you copy?

33:10.989 --> 33:12.425
I repeat.

33:12.468 --> 33:14.122
<i>This is Space Shuttle
"Atlantis."</i>

33:14.166 --> 33:16.646
<i>We are in distress.</i>
- Come on.

33:16.690 --> 33:17.996
Come on.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.915
<i>Hello, Magic.</i>

33:24.959 --> 33:26.613
Janis.

33:26.656 --> 33:28.310
You didn't need to use
Beth like that.

33:28.354 --> 33:29.833
She always liked you.

33:29.877 --> 33:31.879
She's the only reason
you're not in jail right now.

33:31.922 --> 33:34.055
<i>I'm not in jail right now
because you couldn't find me.</i>

33:34.099 --> 33:35.491
Listen, I just want to talk.

33:35.535 --> 33:37.450
I'm trying to understand
what you got Ben into.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.842
What I?

33:40.801 --> 33:43.630
Ben came to me.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.633
He knocked on my door
and asked for my help.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.417
None of this was my idea.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.332
What's in it for you?

33:50.376 --> 33:51.855
I've gone
through his financials

33:51.899 --> 33:52.943
with a fine-tooth comb.

33:52.987 --> 33:54.249
I know he's not paying you.

33:54.293 --> 33:56.034
Stay out of our way, Magic.

33:56.077 --> 33:58.688
Janis, just come in,
talk to me.

33:58.732 --> 34:00.342
We can work this out.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.823
<i>Your time is up.
I would leave if I were you.</i>

34:02.866 --> 34:04.738
I've taken precautions.

34:12.398 --> 34:13.486
Jenn, we gotta go.

34:13.529 --> 34:14.922
- I'm almost there!
- Jenn.

34:14.965 --> 34:16.271
It's not worth it. Come on!

34:16.315 --> 34:17.925
She's gonna burn up
the basement!

34:21.102 --> 34:22.712
You okay?
-  Yeah.

34:22.756 --> 34:26.281
Appreciate the concern,
but it was totally worth it.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.245
Mir, this is "Atlantis."

34:33.288 --> 34:35.160
We have four astronauts
on board.

34:35.203 --> 34:36.900
We are running out of oxygen.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.382
Mir, I repeat.

34:40.426 --> 34:42.210
This is U.S.
Space Shuttle "Atlantis."

34:42.254 --> 34:43.777
Do you copy?
- Jim.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.607
They can't hear us.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.180
I don't understand.

34:55.223 --> 34:56.529
Even if they can't hear you,
how can they not see you?

34:56.572 --> 35:00.141
The shuttle is all white
and huge.

35:00.185 --> 35:02.578
It's the middle
of the night UTC time.

35:02.622 --> 35:04.493
They're sleeping.

35:04.537 --> 35:06.060
That's why they don't
know we're here.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.284
I'm gonna wake them up.

35:13.502 --> 35:15.504
He just unclipped
his safety tether.

35:15.548 --> 35:17.463
David, what are you doing?

35:17.506 --> 35:18.768
<i>We're out of time.</i>

35:18.812 --> 35:20.248
<i>I'm gonna go knock
on their door.</i>

35:20.292 --> 35:22.207
Oh, my God, he's gonna jump.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.514
Ben, wait.
What are you doing?

35:25.558 --> 35:27.647
I'm controlling the leap.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.388
Ben!

35:49.495 --> 35:50.713
Ah!

35:50.757 --> 35:52.150
Aah!

35:52.193 --> 35:53.151
Ben, hold on!

35:55.457 --> 35:57.024
That was close.
- Yeah, too close.

35:57.067 --> 35:57.981
Are you okay?

35:58.025 --> 35:59.200
Yeah.

35:59.244 --> 36:01.246
Now let's see if anyone's home.

36:04.336 --> 36:06.033
Come on. Is anyone there?

36:06.076 --> 36:07.513
You gotta be kidding me!

36:09.210 --> 36:10.994
Hi!

36:12.866 --> 36:14.998
We need help.

36:15.042 --> 36:16.609
Help.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.487
"Atlantis."

36:25.531 --> 36:27.315
<i>Decided to make a house call.</i>

36:27.359 --> 36:29.230
I have contact with Mir.

36:30.884 --> 36:31.972
Way to go, David.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.452
I can't believe it.

36:35.323 --> 36:36.542
Hey.

36:38.239 --> 36:39.893
Hey, uh,

36:39.936 --> 36:41.721
I'm--I'm sorry.

36:51.034 --> 36:53.211
Told ya.

36:58.477 --> 36:59.521
What's Ziggy say?

36:59.565 --> 37:01.958
They survive, all of them.

37:02.002 --> 37:04.831
They dock with Mir,
make their shuttle repairs,

37:04.874 --> 37:06.180
and make it home safe.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.834
Stratton becomes
a shuttle commander,

37:07.877 --> 37:10.489
and David becomes one
of the first astronauts

37:10.532 --> 37:12.404
to live on
the International Space Station

37:12.447 --> 37:13.405
once it's completed.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.929
That's great.

37:18.845 --> 37:21.195
But what are the chances
this leap takes me home?

37:23.719 --> 37:27.462
Honestly, it's 50/50, Ben.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.508
But I promise you,
no matter what happens,

37:29.551 --> 37:33.555
I am going to be with you
every step of the way...

37:33.599 --> 37:36.471
until we get you home.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.387
Thank you.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.652
I'm so glad we could
do this...

37:43.696 --> 37:45.393
together.

38:01.366 --> 38:03.324
Ben's code didn't
bring him back.

38:03.368 --> 38:04.412
We're still not sure why.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.718
We'll find him.

38:05.761 --> 38:07.763
We'll get it
to work eventually.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.376
I want to--

38:13.160 --> 38:14.770
I'm sorry.

38:14.814 --> 38:16.772
I should have told you
about Janis earlier.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.340
And deciding how
to handle Ben's memory

38:19.384 --> 38:21.037
should have been
a group discussion.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.519
I appreciate that.

38:24.563 --> 38:27.392
But you were right.

38:27.435 --> 38:29.698
Even Ben thinks so.

38:29.742 --> 38:30.873
Hm.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.440
Until we have
a better understanding

38:32.484 --> 38:35.356
of his motivations,

38:35.400 --> 38:36.923
we should keep him in the dark.

38:39.012 --> 38:42.102
I spent my entire life
in the military.

38:42.145 --> 38:43.712
And when things go sideways,

38:43.756 --> 38:45.758
I default to barking orders.

38:45.801 --> 38:48.587
But this project is different.

38:48.630 --> 38:52.417
It's gonna take all of us
to figure this out.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.114
I need you.

38:54.157 --> 38:55.724
Thanks, Magic.

38:55.768 --> 38:57.900
We were able
to track down Janis.

38:57.944 --> 38:59.424
She slipped
through our fingers,

38:59.467 --> 39:01.948
but we recovered one
of her hard drives.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.907
Let me show you.

39:06.431 --> 39:07.736
Well, surprise, surprise.

39:07.780 --> 39:09.869
It's encrypted.

39:10.957 --> 39:13.046
- Jenn, can you hack it?
- I tried.

39:13.089 --> 39:15.309
But without an encryption key,
it could take months.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.832
Or never.
- Well, it's likely

39:16.876 --> 39:18.747
that Ben kept a digital key
that he could insert

39:18.791 --> 39:21.228
into the mainframe
that would decrypt the servers.

39:21.271 --> 39:26.581
Um, he probably kept it
on a thumb drive or--

39:29.671 --> 39:31.412
I can help with that.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.722
I found this in my apartment
this morning.

39:36.765 --> 39:39.420
I should have turned it over
when I found it.

39:39.464 --> 39:40.682
It's okay.

39:40.726 --> 39:43.685
We're all figuring
this out as we go.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.383
I was scared
of what was on it,

39:45.426 --> 39:47.210
but I'm not anymore.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.735
Ben might not remember
who he is, but I do.

39:49.778 --> 39:51.432
I saw it today on "Atlantis."

39:51.476 --> 39:53.608
He's, uh--

39:53.652 --> 39:55.523
he's still Ben.

39:56.742 --> 39:58.439
Let's see what's on it.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.885
Yeesh. That's a lot of data.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.758
I think it's cycling like this
because it was designed

40:12.801 --> 40:15.630
with a 3D construct in mind.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.197
Hold on. Let me--

40:31.603 --> 40:33.213
Millions of variables

40:33.256 --> 40:36.521
representing millions
of places in time.

40:47.532 --> 40:48.924
What is that?

40:53.886 --> 40:57.629
Uh... that's a destination.

40:59.195 --> 41:02.111
I--I think that Ben uploaded
all of this new code

41:02.155 --> 41:03.809
and got into the machine
because he was trying

41:03.852 --> 41:05.288
to get to a specific place,

41:05.332 --> 41:06.681
a specific point in time.

41:06.725 --> 41:10.859
But I don't know where or when.

41:10.903 --> 41:12.208
Or why.

41:28.268 --> 41:30.400
- Keep your hands up!

41:30.444 --> 41:31.532
Why are you looking at me?

41:31.576 --> 41:33.969
He's the one
to keep your eyes on.

41:34.013 --> 41:35.710
Wait a second, there must
be a misunderstanding.

41:35.754 --> 41:36.842
Okay, I--
