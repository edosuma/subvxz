01:15.418 --> 01:16.626
Now, Ian!

01:27.460 --> 01:30.001
Ready?

01:34.085 --> 01:38.335
- You've lost it.
- I had it only a few seconds ago!

01:39.376 --> 01:42.126
Yeah... Great!

02:17.376 --> 02:19.334
I found it.

02:19.335 --> 02:24.000
If anything happens...
Eight o'clock?

02:24.001 --> 02:28.293
- Break a leg?
- I think we will.

02:52.918 --> 02:58.251
Are we going to say all this?
Fuck, the world's falling apart.

02:59.168 --> 03:01.376
Jesus Christ, are we on?

03:03.251 --> 03:08.875
Throughout the night several
thousand people have gone missing, -

03:08.876 --> 03:11.334
-including some of the national police.

03:11.335 --> 03:16.125
They are hiring in new people using
Wilco's technology chips.

03:16.126 --> 03:19.584
That's making them as smart
as any national officer.

03:19.585 --> 03:25.167
I apologise for the delay of this
broadcast. The network is busy.

03:25.168 --> 03:29.250
It is being used by people
in much bigger need than our's.

03:29.251 --> 03:35.335
All I can say right now is -
stay tuned, stay safe.

03:56.501 --> 03:58.543
Dylan!

04:04.293 --> 04:09.875
Hey, pal. I've noticed you've
been acting a bit strange lately, -

04:09.876 --> 04:12.918
- So is something wrong?

04:13.793 --> 04:18.334
Mum and dad are just travelling.
You know that, right?

04:21.418 --> 04:28.625
All right. I know it's not your
birthday party for another nine hours.

04:28.626 --> 04:32.460
But I've got you something.

04:33.835 --> 04:38.584
It's the quarterback chip. Just place
it in the thing on your wrist.

04:38.585 --> 04:42.917
And then you know all there is to
know about being a quarterback. Cool'?

04:42.918 --> 04:45.210
Go and get dressed.
We'll be late.

05:15.751 --> 05:19.418
Thank you very much.

05:20.918 --> 05:23.335
Please!

05:23.543 --> 05:26.000
Please!

05:26.001 --> 05:27.918
Thank you.

05:46.251 --> 05:50.585
- Are they not open yet?
- There doesn't seem to be anyone here.

05:57.751 --> 06:00.960
- 7:10.
- It' strange, isn't it?

06:02.543 --> 06:05.460
Yes.
Come on, Dylan.

06:13.710 --> 06:19.251
I have to get back to work. Go to bed,
and I'll be there when you wake up.

06:21.793 --> 06:23.960
I love you.

06:37.918 --> 06:42.459
Hey, Ian!
What are you doing here, Shorty?

06:42.460 --> 06:47.000
Long time, no see!
Where are you working these days?

06:47.001 --> 06:51.335
I just applied for a job
with some pretty high ranking people.

06:54.543 --> 06:59.126
Oh, shit.
Hey, Ian. I forgot my wallet.

07:03.293 --> 07:09.626
Are you sure? Thank you, Ian.
You're the man, Ian! He's the man!

07:23.876 --> 07:26.251
What's this?

07:50.251 --> 07:53.293
Watch it!

08:03.376 --> 08:05.293
Dylan!

09:04.001 --> 09:06.960
IN LOVING MEMORY OF DYLAN
2040-2046

10:27.501 --> 10:29.751
Ok. Fill me in.

10:32.210 --> 10:37.210
Jane, we have 30,000 people missing.

10:38.543 --> 10:43.834
- 30,000?
- The number is rising as we speak.

10:43.835 --> 10:47.876
- Since when?
- 2 a.m. this morning.

11:41.043 --> 11:47.000
At every work hour, in every country,
there is a spike on the graph.

11:47.001 --> 11:52.585
Of course, the graph is
changing drastically, <i>as</i> we speak.

11:53.585 --> 11:59.625
We are receiving tons of calls,
but if you look closely...

11:59.626 --> 12:05.335
- This means?
- We will get three times as many calls.

12:05.501 --> 12:09.625
The average work hour is 8 a.m.?

12:09.626 --> 12:12.210
That's correct.

12:12.376 --> 12:15.710
- What time is it?
- 7:20.

12:15.876 --> 12:19.375
Ian Finch, 18 years old,
no siblings, just moved.

12:19.376 --> 12:24.292
Your family adopted a young boy
a year and a half ago.

12:24.293 --> 12:27.334
Nothing unusual.

12:27.335 --> 12:32.334
Today you were reported missing
after not showing up at Wilco's.

12:32.335 --> 12:37.210
A bit too hasty, maybe, but some
people are a bit too protective.

12:38.126 --> 12:42.460
Where exactly were you?

12:47.293 --> 12:49.918
Excuse me, Mr Finch.

12:50.501 --> 12:53.417
You know...

12:53.418 --> 12:58.668
These handcuffs are really comfortable.
Are they your wife's?

12:59.668 --> 13:03.167
Listen, Ian!
You're in a pretty bad situation.

13:03.168 --> 13:07.043
It pleases me to say that so are you.

13:08.710 --> 13:13.710
You know, I hate politics.
I really do.

13:23.335 --> 13:26.875
A politician once said...
A wise one, actually.

13:26.876 --> 13:31.084
He said that the airways
should belong to the people.

13:31.085 --> 13:34.000
If a TV signal comes to my property, -

13:34.001 --> 13:40.043
- I should feel free to do
any damn thing I want with it.

13:41.251 --> 13:45.417
And right now
you remind me of a TV signal.

13:45.418 --> 13:49.125
- This is my house.
- Really?

13:49.126 --> 13:53.584
I'm pretty sure
I've spent the past year here.

13:53.585 --> 13:55.167
What?

13:55.168 --> 13:58.500
I live here. Is that so hard to get?

13:58.501 --> 14:01.917
Well, yeah...

14:01.918 --> 14:07.543
I don't want to waste any more time.
I think you should leave now.

14:08.251 --> 14:10.001
Excuse me.

14:24.251 --> 14:27.251
I said
you should aim more to the right.

14:28.793 --> 14:31.710
I tend to always lean to that side,
you see...

14:36.585 --> 14:38.418
That's more like it.

14:38.918 --> 14:45.625
- Where's Dylan?
- My brother? You're getting better.

14:45.626 --> 14:49.335
Dylan? My brother Dylan?

14:55.043 --> 14:58.875
Speak up! I can't hear you!

14:58.876 --> 15:04.543
Tiny kid, keeps to himself.

15:13.001 --> 15:18.500
- He's my brother.
- He's your brother?

15:18.501 --> 15:24.460
You and your brother Dylan
live in this house?

15:26.335 --> 15:30.959
You don't find that a bit strange?

15:30.960 --> 15:37.834
So it is just a lot
of coincidental similarities, -

15:37.835 --> 15:42.917
- that may not be
so coincidental after all.

15:42.918 --> 15:45.543
What have you done to him?!

15:45.710 --> 15:49.542
To Dylan? I haven't clone anything.
I was going to ask you the same.

15:49.543 --> 15:54.210
I'm his big brother.
You seem to know a lot about him.

15:57.835 --> 16:01.418
You really don't get it!
Do you have to have it the hard way?

16:38.710 --> 16:43.042
- Do we just have to wait 15 minutes?
- Yes.

16:43.043 --> 16:48.250
Hopefully all hell breaks loose,
and we get an idea of what's going on.

16:48.251 --> 16:52.042
- I have something to show you, Riddley.
- Riddley?

16:52.043 --> 16:55.750
I thought I was handling the case.

16:55.751 --> 16:59.792
Riddley seems more...

16:59.793 --> 17:02.251
I'm taking this case, Michael.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.750
Listen up, everyone!

17:16.751 --> 17:20.416
Meet the new head chief
of this investigation, Jane Scott.

17:20.417 --> 17:23.709
This is all new to us.
It is strange and frightening.

17:23.710 --> 17:27.375
I ask you all to give your best.

17:27.376 --> 17:30.959
Even though some of our staff
has been reported missing.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.250
I leave the rest to Miss Scott.

17:34.251 --> 17:38.209
They are so young and so few.

17:38.210 --> 17:41.626
Best on the planet.

17:42.626 --> 17:45.501
Right, let's get to work, people!

17:45.668 --> 17:50.750
What are we're dealing with? What
happens at 8? Why are people missing?

17:50.751 --> 17:55.500
Are they dead? Thousands
of people don't just disappear!

17:55.501 --> 17:59.501
I want to know where they are.

18:00.001 --> 18:04.250
Were you aware
that three billion people were missing?

18:04.251 --> 18:06.125
- No.
- Then how do you explain...

18:06.126 --> 18:09.168
- I don't.
- Excuse me?

18:13.543 --> 18:16.460
Do I have your attention?

18:17.751 --> 18:20.293
Do you see that guy over there?

18:21.001 --> 18:25.043
Is that muscles, or is he just fat?

18:48.335 --> 18:53.542
He's dead.
A year and a half ago.

18:53.543 --> 18:58.000
- I thought so until you showed up.
- Why didn't you kill me?

18:58.001 --> 19:03.543
- Do you want me to?
- How come he never mentioned you?

19:16.168 --> 19:18.625
What is this?

19:18.626 --> 19:24.000
When I look at myself in the mirror,
I find only sadness, emptiness...

19:24.001 --> 19:27.710
As if I don't exist.

19:32.543 --> 19:36.584
What's going on?
I don't understand anything!

19:36.585 --> 19:40.459
I've been trying to tell you. I could
show you, but you won't like it.

19:40.460 --> 19:45.168
You just tried to kill me,
and now you're offering your help?

19:46.210 --> 19:53.334
Let's just say that your business
is just as much my business.

19:53.335 --> 19:56.001
I want to find him too.

20:14.418 --> 20:17.125
- Let him go, Finch!
- Are you in love with him?

20:17.126 --> 20:21.001
You're acting like a child.
There is no way out of here!

20:23.585 --> 20:27.085
Drop him!

20:29.918 --> 20:31.918
You're a lucky man.

20:48.251 --> 20:53.792
Are they in a different country?
Ls Soviet up and running again?

20:53.793 --> 20:56.542
Millions of people don't
just disappear!

20:56.543 --> 21:02.667
They're not in any country. Population
and heat signals have decreased.

21:02.668 --> 21:08.042
Flights have been cancelled.
Shops and schools stay closed.

21:08.043 --> 21:10.792
It seems
like people are just... gone.

21:10.793 --> 21:14.168
That's a good start. Write it down
and put it on the main screen.

21:15.043 --> 21:18.918
Jane?
Who's this guy?

21:21.210 --> 21:23.292
Did he kill his own brother?

21:23.293 --> 21:29.376
Is this the legendary case
everyone is talking about?

21:30.626 --> 21:34.335
I hope this is important.

21:39.085 --> 21:43.875
He killed his brother, disappeared
and the case got locked down.

21:43.876 --> 21:48.500
He's wanted everywhere. He even
ranks higher than most terrorists.

21:48.501 --> 21:52.292
And they've done
some pretty bad stuff.

21:52.293 --> 21:57.084
Jane... Didn't you spend
half a year on this guy?

21:57.085 --> 22:01.709
Did you ever find his brother?

22:01.710 --> 22:07.251
He killed a family member,
he didn't slaughter a whole town.

22:07.835 --> 22:11.625
What's with all the fuzz?

22:11.626 --> 22:17.168
The brother was not found.
Only blood and what seemed to be...

22:18.460 --> 22:21.668
body parts.

22:21.835 --> 22:27.542
We did spend half a year on the case,
but he disappeared into thin air.

22:27.543 --> 22:32.000
Like a light switch had been
turned off. The system lost him.

22:32.001 --> 22:35.250
We lost him. That's why.

22:35.251 --> 22:41.167
The first time we lose since 2014,
we lose to a teenager.

22:41.168 --> 22:45.542
What did we do wrong?
Is this all part of his plan?

22:45.543 --> 22:48.542
If he's still alive.

22:48.543 --> 22:53.792
- You think he's still alive?
- What's this got to do with anything?

22:53.793 --> 22:55.626
Jane...

22:58.126 --> 23:01.667
- Show me. What have you got?
- Take a look here.

23:01.668 --> 23:05.625
Since we introduced teleportation,
we have more missing people.

23:05.626 --> 23:09.250
- Explain.
- What if something happened that night?

23:09.251 --> 23:12.417
Four billion people
use a teleporter every day.

23:12.418 --> 23:16.667
That's impossible. We tested it
for ages before we made it public.

23:16.668 --> 23:19.750
Did you use a teleporter yesterday?

23:19.751 --> 23:25.084
I walked. I never liked the concept
of being torn apart and put together.

23:25.085 --> 23:30.418
Did anyone here
use a teleporter yesterday?

23:35.210 --> 23:39.793
We need to pay someone a visit.
Lexington street. You come with me.

23:51.376 --> 23:55.335
- Where are we going?
- Lexington...

23:58.751 --> 24:02.417
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

24:02.418 --> 24:05.750
- You just shot her.
- Come on! You think they're real?

24:05.751 --> 24:10.292
- She seems pretty real to me.
- Actually real?

24:10.293 --> 24:13.626
One hand washes the other.
Somebody has to clean up.

24:14.918 --> 24:18.375
- We're going to Lexington street.
- What will we find there?

24:18.376 --> 24:23.250
- Do you know how to handle a gun?
- Why do I need a gun?

24:23.251 --> 24:27.459
- Do you know how to handle a gun?
- My dad used to take me hunting.

24:27.460 --> 24:32.585
Anybody can pull a trigger,
that's not why I'm asking.

24:34.876 --> 24:37.543
Use it. Now.

24:40.835 --> 24:43.210
Take this.

25:14.335 --> 25:17.210
GIVE US BACK OUR IDENTITY

25:28.710 --> 25:32.625
- What was all that about?
- Forget it. It happens all the time.

25:32.626 --> 25:37.710
The "Give Us Back Our identity" idiots.
You'll get your answers.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.709
- Thomas Wilfred?
- Yes, that's me.

25:46.710 --> 25:50.167
We have a problem.
You might have the solution.

25:50.168 --> 25:53.501
Is that right?
I just made some coffee. Come in!

26:06.001 --> 26:10.625
- Sir Wilfred...
- Call me Thomas.

26:10.626 --> 26:13.167
Right... Thomas, this is Ian Finch.

26:13.168 --> 26:17.542
I know who you are.
You don't have to tell me.

26:17.543 --> 26:22.668
I don't know you,
but you're not from around here.

26:26.543 --> 26:30.125
The coffee doesn't quite
taste the same, does it?

26:30.126 --> 26:35.960
The newspaper doesn't feel the same.
But you can't put your finger on it.

26:41.418 --> 26:45.210
Where is that bloody mirror?!

26:49.043 --> 26:51.876
Oh, well. I'll show you.

26:59.168 --> 27:04.126
To you this may sound familiar,
but we have a guest. Take a look.

27:25.501 --> 27:28.668
Do you ever work out?

27:34.585 --> 27:37.250
What do you want?

27:37.251 --> 27:42.335
We'd like to ask you some questions
about your latest invention.

27:44.918 --> 27:47.668
Police, open up!

27:54.918 --> 27:57.625
Aren't you going to invite us in?

27:57.626 --> 28:02.167
I'm sure you can do what you want
to do without seeing my kitchen.

28:02.168 --> 28:05.085
Is that wine in his cup?

28:06.210 --> 28:08.334
This is trespassing!

28:08.335 --> 28:12.542
You're under surveillance
by National Security.

28:12.543 --> 28:16.334
You and your teleportation invention
has killed a billion people.

28:16.335 --> 28:20.375
That's not true. I didn't do that.
I swear on my mother's grave.

28:20.376 --> 28:24.293
Sit down! We need to talk.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.709
I still don't understand
what this is.

28:33.710 --> 28:37.625
Why is my house old, dusty
and turned into a fortress?

28:37.626 --> 28:42.709
- Where's my brother?
- You don't belong here.

28:42.710 --> 28:47.293
You're in the wrong place.
Just like me and him.

28:49.918 --> 28:52.500
That is why
you can't see your reflection.

28:52.501 --> 28:56.625
The world is trying to tell you
that you're in the wrong place.

28:56.626 --> 28:59.500
I never thought it would happen
to anyone but me.

28:59.501 --> 29:05.917
One and a half years ago teleportation
was invented. I had long worked on it.

29:05.918 --> 29:10.750
One and a half years ago, to the
general public, the world changed.

29:10.751 --> 29:15.000
This morning
30,000 people were missing.

29:15.001 --> 29:20.584
Two minutes ago one billion had
vanished. We don't know where they are.

29:20.585 --> 29:24.917
We don't know if they are still alive.
They are gone.

29:24.918 --> 29:28.042
And you think
it has something to do with me?

29:28.043 --> 29:33.500
1.5 years ago the percentage
of missing people rose by 2%.

29:33.501 --> 29:39.834
This year there is a 15% increase.
Your invention might be involved.

29:39.835 --> 29:44.375
Get out of my house! This is bullshit!
Do you think I'm a terrorist?

29:44.376 --> 29:48.417
We are not the regular mall police.

29:48.418 --> 29:52.500
- We need your help.
- Then you'd better bring them...

29:52.501 --> 29:56.293
You made me spill my wine!
...coffee!

29:58.210 --> 30:03.042
So, somewhere in this world,
but not in this world, -

30:03.043 --> 30:08.584
- my five year old brother is trying to
kill himself, and I can't do anything?

30:08.585 --> 30:11.376
I'm afraid so.

30:13.210 --> 30:18.500
And there is no way back?
How did you get back?

30:18.501 --> 30:23.792
Some time ago I came across
some powerful people.

30:23.793 --> 30:28.334
With their help I managed to create
a gateway between the two worlds.

30:28.335 --> 30:33.250
It just happened. Just like you,
I couldn't see anything different.

30:33.251 --> 30:38.250
I could see things were different,
but couldn't put my finger on it.

30:38.251 --> 30:44.334
I was telling myself it was the same,
but then I met myself.

30:44.335 --> 30:46.917
You met yourself?

30:46.918 --> 30:50.459
Yes, and that's why we need your help.

30:50.460 --> 30:56.292
You created this, and you are
the only one who knows it by heart.

30:56.293 --> 31:00.834
- What are my chances?
- Of getting away unnoticed?

31:00.835 --> 31:03.834
None, I'm afraid.

31:03.835 --> 31:06.875
This has happened before
to a few people, me included.

31:06.876 --> 31:12.417
- You went missing in your teleporter?
- No.

31:12.418 --> 31:16.625
I was sent to an alternate universe,
a bit like this.

31:16.626 --> 31:21.834
- This is my alternate reality.
- I'm sorry, but I don't follow.

31:21.835 --> 31:27.917
When you teleport you get dissolved
into atoms and you get reassembled.

31:27.918 --> 31:32.459
When I teleported, something happened.
The atoms collided.

31:32.460 --> 31:38.042
If atoms collide you get a nuclear bomb
or something odd happens.

31:38.043 --> 31:41.792
- Odd?
- They have been working on this.

31:41.793 --> 31:47.792
My atoms collided and I ended up here
in this godforsaken world.

31:47.793 --> 31:51.084
This is my alternate reality.

31:51.085 --> 31:52.876
Can you repeat this process?

31:53.668 --> 31:58.875
It would be almost impossible
to travel between the two realities.

31:58.876 --> 32:02.959
- Why? You've done it before.
- It's quite self-explanatory.

32:02.960 --> 32:08.084
You have all these collisions.
You could even lose body parts.

32:08.085 --> 32:12.584
You could end up with 1/3 in Moscow
and 2/3 in New York.

32:12.585 --> 32:16.959
- You'd come home in pieces!
- How did you do it?

32:16.960 --> 32:20.959
I didn't. My other self did it.
He brought someone with him.

32:20.960 --> 32:24.293
He was the one who got back
without it being a coincident.

32:25.126 --> 32:29.709
I don't think you realize
the seriousness. People may be dead.

32:29.710 --> 32:35.209
They could be scattered around Europe
for all I know.

32:35.210 --> 32:41.167
You might find an arm on my doorstep.
Sorry, pig lady, but I can't help you.

32:41.168 --> 32:46.001
The only thing I know,
is that I know nothing at all.

32:54.251 --> 32:59.334
It's possible, but dangerous. I
can't explain why you're not dead yet.

32:59.335 --> 33:05.834
People from different realities
commit suicide or start riots.

33:05.835 --> 33:09.500
I almost did myself for a while.

33:09.501 --> 33:15.917
I need... We need to get back.
According to you we don't belong here.

33:15.918 --> 33:19.001
- I can't let my brother kill himself!
- My brother.

33:21.751 --> 33:25.710
Ok. Come with me.
I think I might be able to help.

34:01.793 --> 34:04.418
You have a bus?

34:08.085 --> 34:15.167
You need to find a chip that will
manually dissolve you into atoms-

34:15.168 --> 34:19.251
- and drive them together
with incredible force.

34:20.210 --> 34:23.210
Manually bump you off
to an alternate reality.

34:23.835 --> 34:29.250
It kills you
and puts you together again.

34:29.251 --> 34:34.585
You have to hope that the person
coming back is you in one piece.

34:36.335 --> 34:41.333
If you need to save this boy,
I can get you the chip.

34:41.335 --> 34:47.208
It's not going to be easy,
but you didn't expect that, did you?

34:47.210 --> 34:50.210
I've done it before.

34:51.335 --> 34:56.417
I have two chips left in my lab,
and you have to break in to get them.

34:56.418 --> 34:59.667
I can get you through the main doors,
but that's it.

34:59.668 --> 35:03.000
To get access to the chips
you need clearance.

35:03.001 --> 35:08.793
Or you need to be able to make
quick decisions and no mistakes.

35:11.918 --> 35:16.750
Remember, even if you do have a gun,
you don't have to kill people.

35:16.751 --> 35:21.668
Be creative. Sometimes the least
obvious is the most effective.

37:48.085 --> 37:52.501
I may be old, but I haven't lost my
touch. Make sure you don't either.

39:11.876 --> 39:16.209
- How is he?
- Not sure.

39:16.210 --> 39:21.209
Ever since we adopted him
he's been kind of strange.

39:21.210 --> 39:26.793
As if there was some sadness in him.
He was never really happy.

39:28.460 --> 39:31.250
Can I ask you a question?

39:31.251 --> 39:37.334
- What's with all the...
- The murders?

39:37.335 --> 39:42.460
Somebody has to clean up
the mess that we make.

39:43.335 --> 39:48.542
Most people won't do it,
or can't do it on their own.

39:48.543 --> 39:52.209
Sending people to this world
makes society unstable.

39:52.210 --> 39:57.292
Everybody in this world has a double.

39:57.293 --> 40:02.542
I'm just cleaning up.

40:02.543 --> 40:06.918
One hand washes the other?

40:17.668 --> 40:21.542
20 years ago
we started a virtual memory-program.

40:21.543 --> 40:25.584
We each stored our knowledge on a chip,
a second brain, really.

40:25.585 --> 40:30.959
If anything went wrong, we'd take
each other's experience and continue.

40:30.960 --> 40:35.668
Within this is all my knowledge
and experience from the last 20 years.

40:36.876 --> 40:40.751
- I can't...
- You'll need this to break in.

40:42.585 --> 40:46.334
- This is nothing to do with you.
- Listen, Ian.

40:46.335 --> 40:52.084
I've lived a good life. I've made
a gateway to an alternate universe.

40:52.085 --> 40:55.168
Now you go live yours.

41:00.168 --> 41:02.168
Let it go.

43:05.501 --> 43:08.043
I see every step you take, Ian.

43:10.043 --> 43:14.584
Excuse me, sir! Are you new here?
I haven't seen you before.

43:14.585 --> 43:17.210
Ian! There is someone on your tail.

43:20.376 --> 43:23.501
Excuse me.
I'm just trying to help you.

43:24.501 --> 43:26.335
Do something!

43:33.251 --> 43:36.709
Don't! Don't!

43:36.710 --> 43:40.418
If he sets off the alarm,
we're all blown.

44:01.751 --> 44:04.460
I need some hands here!

44:10.585 --> 44:13.251
Police! On the ground!

44:55.251 --> 44:59.001
What were you thinking!
If this blows, it's all on you.

44:59.918 --> 45:02.043
Here.

45:02.335 --> 45:04.293
Shit!

45:05.626 --> 45:07.626
Wait!

45:09.085 --> 45:11.126
Three, two, one, go!

45:17.918 --> 45:21.334
- It's locked.
- How are we going to use these chips?

45:21.335 --> 45:23.251
I don't know.
We need Mr Wilfred!

45:30.293 --> 45:32.585
Fire at will!

45:33.501 --> 45:35.585
That's an order, goddamn it!

45:48.168 --> 45:52.710
Come on, get up!
The door isn't locked. Come on.

46:24.418 --> 46:27.710
Do you have any idea
how to use these things?

46:31.168 --> 46:35.751
- No, but Thomas does.
- He just died.

46:39.168 --> 46:41.293
Thomas just died!

46:43.418 --> 46:46.668
- We don't know how to get back.
- Great!

46:56.376 --> 46:59.251
Let's just improvise.

47:15.876 --> 47:17.835
Now, Ian!

47:27.960 --> 47:30.376
Are you ready?

47:33.210 --> 47:38.501
- You've lost it?
- I swear I had it a few seconds ago.

47:40.376 --> 47:42.585
Yeah...
Great.

48:26.418 --> 48:31.876
- I found it.
- If anything happens: 8 o'clock?

48:34.335 --> 48:38.626
- Break a leg?
- I think we will.

48:48.293 --> 48:51.085
Did we make it'?

48:53.835 --> 48:57.417
Ian Finch, 18 years old,
no siblings, just moved.

48:57.418 --> 49:02.375
Your family adopted a young boy
one and a half years ago.

49:02.376 --> 49:05.126
Nothing unusual.

49:05.418 --> 49:10.334
Today you were reported missing
after not showing up at Wilco's.

49:10.335 --> 49:14.085
A bit too hasty maybe, but some
people are a bit too protective.

49:15.460 --> 49:19.626
Where exactly were you?

49:23.501 --> 49:29.542
I don't think you realize
the seriousness of this matter.

49:29.543 --> 49:36.126
Are you aware that you are the only
one of three billion who has returned?

49:38.043 --> 49:41.042
Are you accusing me of mass murder?

49:41.043 --> 49:44.875
At this point, yes, I'm afraid so.

49:44.876 --> 49:51.126
We have reason to believe
that you are working with this man.

49:52.251 --> 49:58.792
His brother is the boy
your family adopted.

49:58.793 --> 50:04.793
The man killed this boy's twin a week
before the other went to an orphanage.

50:05.960 --> 50:11.792
Why would I co-operate with him if
he's killed my stepbrother's brother?

50:11.793 --> 50:18.209
Cameras picked him up walking
out of the station one hour ago.

50:18.210 --> 50:22.293
Then we found you
in the exactly the same shape.

50:29.210 --> 50:32.210
Excuse me, Mr Finch...

50:32.460 --> 50:34.960
You know...

50:35.293 --> 50:40.668
These handcuffs are really comfortable.
Are they your wife's?

50:41.668 --> 50:44.500
You are in
a pretty bad situation here.

50:44.501 --> 50:49.751
It pleases me to say
that so are you.

50:50.918 --> 50:54.210
Calm down, Riddley.

50:56.251 --> 51:02.375
- Ian, about teleportation...
- You don't know yet?

51:02.376 --> 51:06.334
What the hell am I doing here then?

51:06.335 --> 51:13.460
You don't know that everyone went
missing when using your teleporters?

51:15.543 --> 51:17.459
Don't tell me you don't know?

51:17.460 --> 51:21.959
Were you aware
that 3 billion people were missing?

51:21.960 --> 51:27.543
- No.
- Then how do you explain...

51:31.126 --> 51:34.251
Do I have your attention?

51:35.251 --> 51:38.625
Do you see that guy over there?

51:38.626 --> 51:42.335
Is that muscles, or is he just fat?

51:45.085 --> 51:48.042
- Let him go Finch.
- Are you in love with him?

51:48.043 --> 51:51.501
You're acting like a child!
There's no way out of here!

51:54.376 --> 51:59.251
Drop him. She wants you alive,
but you know I'll take the shot.

52:04.668 --> 52:07.335
You're a lucky man.

52:17.460 --> 52:20.335
- On time.
- Should be.

52:42.418 --> 52:46.875
- The interrogator mentioned you.
- What about?

52:46.876 --> 52:51.210
Something inappropriate at the moment.

52:57.793 --> 53:01.001
Please, Ian.
These people are real.

53:03.126 --> 53:06.709
You should become an actor!

53:06.710 --> 53:10.168
You've just played along
all this time.

53:13.085 --> 53:16.085
I'm not up for any games.

53:17.793 --> 53:23.168
Another riot. They have probably
realized how many people are gone.

53:27.043 --> 53:34.043
My brother, the boy Wilfred died for,
the one we're risking our lives for...

53:36.001 --> 53:40.959
- it was all your fault, wasn't it'?
- Are you taking about the murder?

53:40.960 --> 53:45.126
Can you even remember
seeing your brother in the mirror?

53:49.751 --> 53:51.585
Open fire!

53:57.210 --> 54:00.334
Somehow, your brother from
the world we were just in, -

54:00.335 --> 54:06.210
- the alternate reality, managed
to end up in this world. Our world.

54:07.960 --> 54:12.293
I panicked! There were two of them
and they were fighting.

54:12.460 --> 54:15.793
There wasn't a single hair
that didn't look the same.

54:17.751 --> 54:20.293
I killed one of them.

54:21.668 --> 54:25.043
I didn't mean to...

54:27.251 --> 54:29.668
Get your shit together!

54:29.876 --> 54:34.126
I was the one respecting you.
Remember that?

54:35.335 --> 54:38.335
Let's not change that.

54:48.460 --> 54:50.126
We're home now.

54:51.335 --> 54:53.168
Go!

54:59.168 --> 55:03.000
- Why didn't you try to get back?
- Are you serious?

55:03.001 --> 55:06.501
Do you think
I could survive this on my own?

55:19.960 --> 55:22.875
Not bad. No, Ian!

55:22.876 --> 55:27.751
I know you want to see him, but we
need to get through many teleporters.

55:33.126 --> 55:36.667
Are you going in there?

55:36.668 --> 55:38.918
Three billion!

56:07.335 --> 56:09.459
They are using the teleporters!

56:09.460 --> 56:13.500
Listen up! They are using
the teleporters in order to escape.

56:13.501 --> 56:19.750
I want them here! Change their
location. Shoot them! I want them here!

56:19.751 --> 56:22.251
Here?

56:31.376 --> 56:35.210
- Halt! You're under arrest!
- Oh, really?

56:44.001 --> 56:47.460
Where are they? I need their location!

56:50.585 --> 56:53.668
Relocate the Plaza teleporter
right now.

56:58.460 --> 57:00.793
Where did my gun go?

57:04.251 --> 57:08.043
John, are you there?
Where are they?

57:11.210 --> 57:15.418
Relocate every teleporter back here.

57:15.710 --> 57:18.168
- Everyone?
- Yes!

57:20.835 --> 57:24.710
They're changing
the teleporters locations!

57:25.585 --> 57:29.376
Are they all relocated here?

57:43.376 --> 57:45.626
What are you waiting for?

57:46.210 --> 57:50.085
- She's real. She's...
- We don't have time for this.

57:50.335 --> 57:53.043
But...

57:57.335 --> 57:59.418
Come on!

59:05.710 --> 59:08.334
It's over. I won't let you push me.

59:08.335 --> 59:13.250
Is that what you said when you killed
yourself? She wanted your place.

59:13.251 --> 59:18.959
You're not from here. You're that
other person Wilfred talked about.

59:18.960 --> 59:23.000
You brought this guy to cover it up.

59:23.001 --> 59:25.792
- What's he talking about.
- It's obvious!

59:25.793 --> 59:30.584
The only person who seems to know
what is going on. You killed him...

59:30.585 --> 59:36.626
Now I'm the threatening one,
so you bring the police force after me!

59:38.001 --> 59:43.167
I have a five year old brother
at home. He killed the wrong version.

59:43.168 --> 59:49.417
You know it is hard to live in a World
where you have nothing to relate to.

59:49.418 --> 59:52.542
I know you do.

59:52.543 --> 59:56.043
Now let me go.

01:00:41.710 --> 01:00:43.793
Dylan...

01:00:52.585 --> 01:00:55.210
Happy birthday, kiddo.
