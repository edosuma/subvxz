00:11.792 --> 00:14.642
Oh, no, Mr. Monk,
your sideburns are fine.

00:14.676 --> 00:16.126
They're even.
They're fine.

00:16.158 --> 00:18.515
No, they're not even.
Now this one's longer.

00:18.533 --> 00:21.100
Mr. Monk, I am looking right at you,
and they are even.

00:21.177 --> 00:23.907
He did a perfect job.
You're even steven.

00:23.948 --> 00:26.440
Knew I should've waited
for sebastian to come back.

00:26.490 --> 00:29.774
I... Feel it.
This side feels heavier.

00:29.806 --> 00:31.807
I'm gonna be walking 
around like this.

00:31.862 --> 00:33.628
- I'm going back.
- No, Mr. Monk, you can't.

00:33.655 --> 00:36.966
You cannot go back. He said he would
call the police. No, stop, stop. just...

00:37.422 --> 00:40.539
Take your tongue and put it
on that side of your mouth.

00:41.122 --> 00:42.856
And just
balance it out.

00:46.478 --> 00:47.483
All right?

00:49.839 --> 00:50.877
- It works.
- huh?

00:53.619 --> 00:55.665
Excuse me.
I'm so sorry.

00:56.115 --> 00:57.115
No problem.

Mr. Monk?

01:35.848 --> 01:36.948
That woman...

01:37.598 --> 01:38.648
What about her?

01:44.857 --> 01:45.857
Mr. Monk!

02:23.149 --> 02:24.162
Mr. Monk!

02:24.434 --> 02:25.662
Are you okay?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.462
What was that all about?

02:33.149 --> 02:34.427
That woman...

02:34.845 --> 02:35.973
Who was she?

02:36.247 --> 02:38.253
I don't know.
I've never seen her before.

02:38.354 --> 02:39.832
Then why were 
you chasing her?

02:43.055 --> 02:44.366
I don't know.

03:45.646 --> 03:47.296
An hispanic woman?

03:49.028 --> 03:50.028
How old?

03:51.323 --> 03:53.539
40, maybe 45.

03:53.722 --> 03:55.538
And you didn't recognize her?

03:55.755 --> 03:57.888
Never seen her before in my life.

03:58.293 --> 04:00.519
Well, Adrian, you know,
you can't be sure of that,

04:00.552 --> 04:04.005
because nobody could
possibly rember all of

04:04.038 --> 04:06.118
all of the people that they...
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:06.149 --> 04:08.216
You never saw her before.
But...

04:08.860 --> 04:09.876
Maybe.

04:10.051 --> 04:13.637
She reminded you of
someone from an old case.

04:15.319 --> 04:18.497
Adrian, it had to be something.
You had a visceral reaction to her.

04:18.533 --> 04:20.723
You chased the woman 
for two blocks.

04:21.992 --> 04:22.992
You all right?

04:24.500 --> 04:25.500
Tired.

04:27.039 --> 04:28.489
I haven't slept.

04:28.906 --> 04:31.273
You haven't slept
since when?

04:31.900 --> 04:32.900
Three days.

04:33.419 --> 04:36.639
Three days is friday,
the day that you saw this woman.

04:37.770 --> 04:38.770
I just...

04:39.377 --> 04:40.627
Can't sleep.

04:41.313 --> 04:43.149
When I close my eyes,

04:43.825 --> 04:45.334
I... I see her.

04:48.006 --> 04:50.107
All I can see is her face.

04:52.732 --> 04:54.823
- It's fascinating.
- Yes, isn't it?

04:55.110 --> 04:57.622
Isn't it fascinating?
I'm so glad you're intrigued.

04:57.716 --> 04:58.822
Who is she?!

04:59.567 --> 05:01.613
Why is she haunting me?

05:01.763 --> 05:03.582
- I don't know.
- Well, think!

05:06.200 --> 05:07.834
- I don't know.
- what you really think.

05:07.870 --> 05:10.326
Yes, I was really thinking,
but Adrian, I think maybe you

05:10.359 --> 05:14.088
find her attractive,
and this could be a very healthy sign.

05:15.811 --> 05:16.824
Maybe.

05:22.492 --> 05:24.780
No,
that's not it.

05:25.009 --> 05:27.548
All right, Adrian,
you can't go on this way.

05:27.585 --> 05:30.566
You're going to have to get some sleep.
There are mild sedatives...

05:30.622 --> 05:32.301
No.
No pills.

05:34.044 --> 05:35.869
There's nothing else I can really say.

05:37.803 --> 05:40.390
Does anyone ever die from insomnia?

05:41.957 --> 05:42.970
Nah.

05:43.954 --> 05:45.717
So I would be the first?

05:48.885 --> 05:51.829
Next we have this set
of porcelain figurines.

05:52.117 --> 05:53.898
Can we get a close-up of these?

05:54.536 --> 05:56.223
Aren't they exquisite?

05:56.395 --> 05:59.924
Now, this is a limited edition,
so, once their gone,

06:00.009 --> 06:01.023
they're gone.

06:01.140 --> 06:02.500
Oh, we have a call!

06:02.824 --> 06:05.134
Hi, what is your name and
where are you calling from?

06:05.422 --> 06:06.837
My name is Adrian.

06:07.145 --> 06:08.776
I'm calling from san francisco.

06:09.142 --> 06:10.570
Hello, Adrian.

06:10.639 --> 06:12.420
Welcome to the shopper's network.

06:12.574 --> 06:14.663
Are you buying these
figurines for yourself?

06:14.710 --> 06:16.660
Uh, I wonder if you could do me a favor.

06:17.066 --> 06:19.759
The panda on the end
is a little crooked.

06:20.936 --> 06:23.649
If you could just rotate it slightly.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.328
About 15 degrees.

06:25.763 --> 06:26.778
The panda?

06:27.550 --> 06:30.455
Well,
if it's that important to you.

06:31.176 --> 06:32.190
Thank you.

06:32.359 --> 06:36.026
Well, Adrian, now that you see them all
lined up, would you like to order a set?

06:36.072 --> 06:38.569
Mm, no, I've seen them cheaper all over.

06:38.875 --> 06:41.216
I do have a question
about the giraffe though.

06:41.774 --> 06:44.901
Does his head look symmetrical to you?
I mean, look at it.

06:45.584 --> 06:47.196
Brian, who is this guy?

06:47.235 --> 06:49.382
I'm sorry,
I can't sleep.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.377
- Help me.
- Okay, well...

06:51.392 --> 06:53.453
- Help me.
- Thank you for calling in, sir.

06:53.508 --> 06:56.311
These lovely figurines
each is hand crafted,

06:56.353 --> 06:58.373
but there are only a few hundred left.

06:58.412 --> 07:00.358
So... Oh!
Here's another call.

07:00.597 --> 07:01.611
It's the same guy.

07:02.118 --> 07:03.266
Don't answer it.

07:03.609 --> 07:05.279
Next, we have this...

07:59.802 --> 08:00.817
I knew it.

08:09.739 --> 08:10.753
Hello?

08:10.976 --> 08:12.615
Ah, thank god you're awake.

08:12.881 --> 08:13.881
Mr. Monk?

08:14.098 --> 08:17.055
I couldn't sleep either.
Can you get over here?

08:18.497 --> 08:20.457
I can't, I'm sorry, um...

08:20.903 --> 08:23.172
Julie's sick.
She's got 101.

08:23.265 --> 08:24.710
Yeah, that's pretty serious.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.117
Be sure you bundle her up
before you put her in the car.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.609
Mr. Monk,
I'm not coming over.

08:30.296 --> 08:32.119
Is this about the woman that you saw?

08:32.311 --> 08:34.917
I keep, thinking about her.

08:35.596 --> 08:37.392
Natalie, I think I'm going crazy.

08:37.528 --> 08:40.746
Mr. Monk, you just need to get out
of the house, you know, go someplace.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.280
Take a walk.

08:42.436 --> 08:43.496
A walk.

08:43.623 --> 08:45.371
Yeah, that's what I do
when I can't sleep.

08:45.410 --> 08:47.236
A little exercise,
some fresh air.

08:47.642 --> 08:48.656
Where would I go?

08:48.699 --> 08:51.815
Oh, it doesn't matter, anywhere.
Just head south.

08:52.642 --> 08:55.981
If I headed north,
I could swing by your place.

08:57.442 --> 08:58.816
I would head south.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.310
Poindexter!
You gonna pay for that paper?

09:47.342 --> 09:48.647
No, no, I was just... No...

09:48.664 --> 09:51.816
Keep your mitts off my bundles,
understand?

10:07.404 --> 10:09.713
'Scuse me,
do you need a taxi?

10:09.855 --> 10:11.759
No thanks, I'm good.

10:15.427 --> 10:16.629
My god, it's her!

10:17.426 --> 10:18.815
Hello, wait!

10:19.740 --> 10:20.763
Wait!

10:21.325 --> 10:22.339
Taxi!

10:23.048 --> 10:24.149
Taxi!

10:25.944 --> 10:28.220
- Hey, buddy!
- Taxi? Not you.

10:32.474 --> 10:34.565
Stop!
Wait!

11:07.419 --> 11:08.569
Hey what is that ?

11:08.620 --> 11:11.087
- Are you wearing a wire ?
- what are you talking about ?

11:11.168 --> 11:12.496
You cop?

11:12.740 --> 11:16.192
No, not a cop. Come on guys,
are we gonna do this deal or not ?

11:16.727 --> 11:18.038
This guy is wearing a wire.

11:18.121 --> 11:21.374
I'm not wearing a wire.
Look, this deal is over.

11:21.499 --> 11:23.337
See,
I told you we couldn't trust this guy.

11:23.364 --> 11:25.970
You brought him into it. I'm gonna go.
I shouldn't even be here.

11:26.003 --> 11:29.185
You're both under arrest.
Up against the wall. Now!

11:29.260 --> 11:31.325
I don't believe it. Hold on,
let me see that badge.

11:31.411 --> 11:33.063
Doing he's a cop!
Just do what he says.

11:33.096 --> 11:35.290
He's not a cop, man.
He's just trying to rip us off.

12:23.452 --> 12:24.497
We gotta get outta here!

12:25.474 --> 12:27.548
Are you listening to me?

12:27.857 --> 12:30.910
I didn't do anything. I just wanted
to buy a little coke for the weekend.

12:31.143 --> 12:33.351
Yeah, try telling that to the judge.

12:33.662 --> 12:34.919
We just killed a cop!

12:35.384 --> 12:36.396
My god!

12:37.086 --> 12:38.288
Come on!

13:19.698 --> 13:20.884
Don't talk to me about it.

13:22.538 --> 13:23.631
How you doing?

13:25.967 --> 13:27.309
We gotta do this again.

13:27.647 --> 13:28.647
You understand.

13:28.919 --> 13:29.934
Excuse me.

13:30.568 --> 13:32.724
It's allergies,
it's not contagious.

13:33.967 --> 13:37.796
Okay, you came out
to take a walk around 1:00 am.

13:38.077 --> 13:39.263
And you saw the woman.

13:39.629 --> 13:41.479
This is the woman
you've been looking for.

13:43.747 --> 13:44.747
Who is she?

13:44.934 --> 13:46.345
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

13:46.556 --> 13:48.702
So this mystery woman drives a cab.

13:48.808 --> 13:50.869
You chased the cab.
Who can blame ya?

13:50.985 --> 13:53.511
You run down this alley,
you try to cut her off,

13:53.731 --> 13:54.889
and you hear voices.

13:54.940 --> 13:57.314
They're coming from that restaurant,
so you look through the window.

13:58.294 --> 13:59.480
There were three men.

14:00.037 --> 14:02.315
Some kind of drug deal gone wrong.

14:02.362 --> 14:05.560
There was a guy in a suit,
a dealer, and an undercover cop.

14:06.336 --> 14:07.452
Are you sure he was a cop?

14:07.585 --> 14:08.857
He flashed a badge.

14:10.019 --> 14:11.401
There was a fight.

14:12.203 --> 14:13.606
The dealer shot the cop.

14:13.842 --> 14:15.824
You saw the dealer shoot the cop.

14:16.406 --> 14:17.420
Yeah.

14:18.381 --> 14:19.980
And then the suit and the dealer

14:20.126 --> 14:23.378
run out back, they jump into a
blue buick, and they drive away.

14:23.435 --> 14:24.435
And no license?

14:24.768 --> 14:25.781
No, it was too dark.

14:25.814 --> 14:28.746
You ran three blocks, found
a phone booth, and called it in.

14:31.525 --> 14:33.382
So who was he, the dead cop?

14:37.261 --> 14:38.759
Monk, you gotta come with us.

15:04.595 --> 15:05.609
Anything?

15:05.693 --> 15:06.972
No bullets, no blood.

15:07.020 --> 15:08.065
Did you check the walls?

15:09.382 --> 15:12.437
- If it happened, it didn't happen here.
- Ifit happened?

15:12.500 --> 15:15.730
- Wh... What does that mean?
- It means there's no body, Monk.

15:16.337 --> 15:18.334
No signs of a struggle, no blood.

15:18.767 --> 15:20.609
The kitchen's clean.

15:20.724 --> 15:22.286
I wouldn't give it four stars,

15:22.317 --> 15:25.624
but nobody has been shot
to death here in the last half hour.

15:26.208 --> 15:27.949
- But the...
- The dead cop!

15:28.056 --> 15:30.225
Every officer in this
city's been accounted for.

15:30.640 --> 15:31.662
Nobody's missing.

15:31.710 --> 15:32.864
You got a tissue?

15:34.393 --> 15:35.393
Never mind, I got one.

15:35.424 --> 15:39.045
This is zena davis, she's a waitress
here. She's been here all night.

15:39.459 --> 15:42.908
So you must've
seen it or at least heard it.

15:42.935 --> 15:44.115
No, sir, I'm sorry.

15:44.392 --> 15:47.513
I don't know what it is that you think
you saw, but I've been here cleaning.

15:47.561 --> 15:50.635
We have an inspection next week, and
the manager wants it all spick-and-span.

15:50.722 --> 15:52.346
There were shots.
There were...

15:53.049 --> 15:55.202
Right, there were four gunshots.

15:56.311 --> 15:57.325
Right...

16:03.525 --> 16:04.525
Is he okay?

16:05.243 --> 16:06.319
Wait a minute!

16:06.825 --> 16:07.839
Okay.

16:11.066 --> 16:12.533
No shot casings?

16:13.383 --> 16:14.540
What do you call this?

16:17.981 --> 16:19.323
I call that a money clip.

16:20.865 --> 16:22.122
Oh, thanks a lot.

16:22.205 --> 16:24.023
- Been looking for that.
- J.P.?

16:24.746 --> 16:26.589
Jeremy peters.
He's one of our cooks.

16:28.341 --> 16:29.901
Are you guys gonna be here much longer?

16:29.934 --> 16:32.866
No, no... Thank you very much
for your time, miss davis,

16:32.916 --> 16:34.852
and good luck with that inspection.

16:35.270 --> 16:36.365
Monk, let's go.

16:38.300 --> 16:39.313
Come on, come on.

16:46.699 --> 16:49.123
Leland, I know what I saw.

16:49.205 --> 16:52.226
Monk, I talked to natalie.
She said you haven't been sleeping.

16:52.309 --> 16:54.206
I heard you on the shopper's network.

16:54.505 --> 16:56.768
I was flipping channels
looking for sports.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.577
Look, when I go 36 hours without sleep,

16:59.610 --> 17:02.458
I get punchy, I start seeing things.
They have a name for that.

17:02.491 --> 17:05.102
- It's, um... Waking dreams.
- Waking dreams.

17:05.136 --> 17:06.396
- Yeah.
- how long you been up?

17:06.596 --> 17:07.608
Three days.

17:08.851 --> 17:10.777
Boy,
I'm surprised you're still standing.

17:12.001 --> 17:15.121
Look... Listen, this is what you're
gonna do. Listen to dr. Stottlemeyer.

17:15.147 --> 17:17.663
- Who's dr. Stottlemeyer?
- I'm dr. Stottlemeyer.

17:18.289 --> 17:20.131
You're gonna go
to a bar...

17:20.214 --> 17:23.498
Down on pearl street. It's near the
bridge. It's called pastor's tavern.

17:23.631 --> 17:24.965
You're gonna order one shot.

17:25.016 --> 17:26.040
A single malt scotch.

17:26.074 --> 17:27.926
- I don't drink.
- You're drinking tonight.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.263
Now, listen...

17:29.738 --> 17:32.640
There's a big fish tank behind
the bar with one little fish.

17:32.956 --> 17:35.545
You're gonna watch that little
fishy swim round and round...

17:35.813 --> 17:37.509
You're gonna watch the bubbles go up.

17:37.671 --> 17:39.452
And you're gonna drink your scotch.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.920
And then you're gonna go home,

17:41.542 --> 17:42.753
and you're gonna go to sleep.

17:43.626 --> 17:44.754
You think it'll work?

17:44.888 --> 17:46.897
Works for me every time without fail.

17:47.425 --> 17:48.695
I don't know.

17:48.761 --> 17:49.770
Well, I do.

17:50.516 --> 17:52.690
Sweet dreams, Monk.
Call me when you wake up.

17:53.492 --> 17:54.505
Hey, hey.

17:55.909 --> 17:56.909
Pearl street.

18:02.199 --> 18:03.544
- Good night.
- Yep.

18:15.009 --> 18:16.021
What can I get you?

18:16.353 --> 18:18.934
One shot.
Single malt.

18:19.638 --> 18:20.638
Want that neat?

18:21.571 --> 18:22.793
Yes, neat,

18:23.347 --> 18:25.067
please.
Very neat.

18:26.520 --> 18:27.781
You know what "neat" means?

18:28.101 --> 18:30.057
- No.
- But you got there.

18:32.642 --> 18:33.675
Bourbon!

18:35.304 --> 18:37.061
Mother's milk.
Drink of kings.

18:37.732 --> 18:40.088
Bourbon makes a man feel
the way he oughta feel

18:40.477 --> 18:41.523
without bourbon.

18:43.098 --> 18:44.361
You guys like to gamble?

18:46.249 --> 18:47.262
Little bit?

18:48.651 --> 18:50.398
Well, I got a buck right here...

18:51.260 --> 18:53.003
Says I can drink this bourbon

18:53.869 --> 18:55.562
without even touching the glass.

18:57.047 --> 18:58.756
without even touching the glass?

19:01.997 --> 19:03.209
All right, you're on.

19:21.378 --> 19:23.353
- All right, you touched the glass.
- So I did.

19:24.212 --> 19:25.225
I lose.

19:25.720 --> 19:26.938
You're the big winner.

19:27.404 --> 19:28.404
Here's your dollar.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.805
That'll be $8.00 for the bourbon.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.443
Goldfish.

19:45.156 --> 19:47.181
You know they have
absolutely no memory?

19:47.275 --> 19:50.130
Every time that little fella
takes a lap around that tank,

19:50.491 --> 19:52.450
it's like he's seeing it
for the first time.

19:52.682 --> 19:54.508
Bet you wish you were
in there with him.

19:55.047 --> 19:56.959
You could cheat him
out of all of his money,

19:57.592 --> 19:58.737
he'd never catch on.

19:58.917 --> 20:01.055
Oh, buddy,
I'm in there with him.

20:03.160 --> 20:04.355
You're a con man.

20:04.983 --> 20:07.514
Hey, it's 2:00 in the
morning in the big city.

20:07.714 --> 20:10.504
Everyone you meet at this
hour is on the grift, right?

20:10.738 --> 20:13.676
Big con, little con,
everybody's playing the angles.

20:15.464 --> 20:16.491
Not thirsty?

20:17.047 --> 20:19.071
- Not much of a drinker.
- Yeah, me neither.

20:20.319 --> 20:24.220
I just can't think of a better way to
get all this alcohol into my body.

20:24.438 --> 20:26.469
Barkeep, can I have a g&t, please?

20:27.515 --> 20:28.796
Name's gulliver.

20:28.874 --> 20:30.246
"Gully" to my friends.

20:31.551 --> 20:32.551
Adrian.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.112
So that's what you do?

20:35.619 --> 20:38.413
You just go around cheating kids
out of their allowance?

20:40.024 --> 20:42.232
Cheapest lesson that kid'll ever learn.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.151
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
pull any of that stuff with you.

20:45.206 --> 20:46.235
No, you're an adult.

20:47.339 --> 20:48.970
You've been around, I can tell.

20:49.148 --> 20:50.898
- Well, that's right.
- You've seen things.

20:51.774 --> 20:52.952
That's right.

20:53.579 --> 20:56.129
Yep, you probably don't
even bet or gamble.

20:57.395 --> 20:58.554
You're straight edge.

21:00.519 --> 21:01.946
That's...
That's right.

21:02.875 --> 21:04.253
If you were ever to bet,

21:04.614 --> 21:06.141
it would have to be a sure thing.

21:07.232 --> 21:08.775
- That's right.
- For instance,

21:08.808 --> 21:11.723
if I were to say, let's you and me
play a little poker, you'd say no way.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.799
Yeah, that's right.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.762
But on the other hand, if I were to say,

21:14.845 --> 21:16.836
"I bet I know where you got your shoes,"

21:17.602 --> 21:19.233
now, that might give you pause.

21:19.396 --> 21:21.269
Now, that's a bet you just might take.

21:21.368 --> 21:22.604
You don't know me.

21:23.063 --> 21:24.756
Right?
We've never seen each other before.

21:24.789 --> 21:26.853
There's no way I know
where you got your shoes.

21:27.699 --> 21:28.712
Exactly.

21:29.831 --> 21:30.844
No.

21:33.346 --> 21:34.408
How much?

21:34.623 --> 21:35.635
What?

21:36.653 --> 21:38.256
I'll bet you 50 bucks

21:38.308 --> 21:39.910
I can tell where you got your shoes.

21:41.731 --> 21:43.263
Where I got these shoes?

21:44.248 --> 21:45.935
- These shoes?
- yeah.

21:46.099 --> 21:47.411
The ones I'm wearing?

21:54.003 --> 21:55.016
Okay.

21:55.698 --> 21:56.854
You're on.

22:01.177 --> 22:02.803
You got those shoes...

22:07.585 --> 22:08.707
On your feet.

22:20.503 --> 22:22.157
- Trudy Monk?
- yeah.

22:22.563 --> 22:24.801
- She was beautiful.
- Yes, she was.

22:25.246 --> 22:28.145
Beauty isn't everything,
but it's sure nice to look at.

22:28.215 --> 22:29.792
You're really very deep.

22:29.861 --> 22:31.017
I just sound deep.

22:31.111 --> 22:32.934
Deep down,
I'm very shallow.

22:33.396 --> 22:35.189
- She was an organ donor.
- Yeah.

22:35.603 --> 22:36.603
She was an angel.

22:38.237 --> 22:40.444
What are you doing out here so late?

22:41.061 --> 22:44.359
You're a sunflower, you're a delicate
thing. You should be home in bed.

22:44.560 --> 22:46.270
Yeah,
I can't sleep.

22:47.158 --> 22:49.214
Why, because of this other
woman? This taxi driver?

22:49.247 --> 22:51.289
I know
it's crazy.

22:51.992 --> 22:54.183
It sounds crazy, it feels crazy.

22:54.233 --> 22:55.262
I understand.

22:56.007 --> 22:57.007
Listen...

22:57.568 --> 22:58.814
You know the train station.

22:58.914 --> 23:01.238
There's a taxi stand
at the south street exit

23:01.326 --> 23:04.625
The dispatcher's name is essie.
She knows every hack in the city.

23:05.555 --> 23:06.555
Essie.

23:06.865 --> 23:07.865
Essie.

23:10.235 --> 23:11.235
Okay.

23:11.796 --> 23:13.841
I'm gonna do it.
I got nothing to lose.

23:13.918 --> 23:15.339
All right,
remember the hour.

23:15.851 --> 23:17.377
Can't trust anyone out there.

23:17.475 --> 23:18.496
Where's your wallet?

23:18.525 --> 23:19.537
Back pocket.

23:19.784 --> 23:21.533
Bad idea.
Give it to me.

23:21.796 --> 23:23.067
- Give it to me.
- Look. Here.

23:23.117 --> 23:24.794
This fifty.
This is yours.

23:24.827 --> 23:27.034
- Oh, no...
- No, shh, shh.

23:27.436 --> 23:29.345
- You got an inside pocket?
- Yeah, right here.

23:29.402 --> 23:31.456
All right, that's where you keep this.

23:31.593 --> 23:33.601
All right, nice and close to you.
Can you feel it?

23:33.703 --> 23:34.881
- Yeah,
- Okay.

23:35.697 --> 23:37.892
Gully,
I don't know what to say.

23:38.081 --> 23:41.314
Don't say anything. Just go find your
mystery woman, go home, get some sleep.

23:42.418 --> 23:43.432
Okay.

23:44.977 --> 23:45.989
You...

23:46.115 --> 23:47.115
You're a good man.

23:53.703 --> 23:54.798
Don't bet on it.

23:57.383 --> 23:59.378
She's not hispanic.
She's from brazil,

23:59.427 --> 24:01.688
which makes her latino.
There's a difference.

24:01.705 --> 24:03.417
- So you know her?
- Silver star taxi,

24:03.485 --> 24:06.014
number 402.
That's maria cordova.

24:06.063 --> 24:08.658
- Maria!
- I'm sure you two will be very happy.

24:08.695 --> 24:10.819
- Well, do you know where...
- She'll be back at 4:30

24:10.848 --> 24:12.718
for the first commuter express.

24:13.198 --> 24:14.519
You can wait in there.

24:14.589 --> 24:16.898
- Just wanna say...
- Yeah, you're welcome.

25:02.188 --> 25:03.250
It can't be.

25:05.688 --> 25:07.376
He was shot.
I saw him.

25:13.820 --> 25:14.820
He's a dead man.

25:26.038 --> 25:27.050
Monk...

25:27.115 --> 25:30.221
There's something you never
knew about me. I like to sleep.

25:30.485 --> 25:34.142
I like to get into bed and not
get out of bed until I wake up.

25:34.191 --> 25:37.304
His name is william lee,
and he's been here all night. No..

25:37.321 --> 25:40.391
He's taking the train in the morning.
To visit his brother in portland.

25:40.497 --> 25:43.428
Mr. Lee says that he's not an undercover
cop, and he's never been to the

25:43.461 --> 25:45.015
- bay street cafe.
- Well...

25:45.060 --> 25:46.997
He also says he's never
been shot four times.

25:47.027 --> 25:48.654
- He's lying.
- About what, Monk?

25:48.929 --> 25:50.877
In my experience,
a person that's been shot

25:50.927 --> 25:52.920
four times is pretty
forthcoming about it.

25:53.058 --> 25:55.241
Monk, I called it in, he checks out.

25:56.477 --> 25:57.732
I saw you.

25:58.770 --> 26:01.576
Mister, whatever you think you saw,
it wasn't me. Now, can I go?

26:01.642 --> 26:03.204
Yes, sir, absolutely, you can go.

26:03.237 --> 26:04.897
Thank you very much.
Sorry to bother you.

26:04.935 --> 26:06.753
- "Sorry to bother you"?
- Monk, it's late.

26:06.820 --> 26:08.235
All right, we gotta follow this guy.

26:08.301 --> 26:09.447
Follow him where?

26:09.893 --> 26:11.788
Hey, did you go to the
tavern like I told you?

26:11.821 --> 26:13.853
Leland, I know.
I'm tired.

26:13.990 --> 26:15.168
But I'm telling you,

26:15.228 --> 26:17.319
He was the dead guy.
Oh, wait, hey!

26:17.568 --> 26:19.199
He was throwing something away.

26:22.424 --> 26:23.666
What are you wearing?

26:25.246 --> 26:26.246
Your pjs?

26:26.318 --> 26:28.459
- Yeah, I was sleeping.
- What is that, a picture?

26:28.573 --> 26:30.017
Lemme see.
Lemme see.

26:31.683 --> 26:32.945
Captain america.

26:33.481 --> 26:34.481
It's ironic.

26:34.620 --> 26:36.711
Well, if it's ironic,
why are you trying to hide it?

26:36.813 --> 26:38.074
Adds to the irony.

26:38.488 --> 26:39.966
You know what?
Just forget about it.

26:40.002 --> 26:41.771
You wouldn't understand.
It's a gen x thing.

26:43.496 --> 26:44.509
Captain!

26:45.179 --> 26:46.274
Uh, which one?

26:49.833 --> 26:50.845
Look!

26:54.040 --> 26:57.133
Rare coin cases. Collectors use these.
And check this out.

26:57.727 --> 26:59.569
"Jacob posner" "j.P."

26:59.732 --> 27:03.383
j.P., remember? The money clip from
the restaurant... Same initials.

27:03.433 --> 27:06.022
Monk, there've gotta be a million
guys with these same initials.

27:06.054 --> 27:07.063
Okay,

27:07.179 --> 27:08.888
what was he doing with all these coins?

27:08.921 --> 27:09.930
What coins?

27:10.271 --> 27:12.238
You were standing way
the hell over there, right?

27:12.271 --> 27:14.745
H- how could you see
what he was throwing out?

27:14.811 --> 27:16.808
At least we should check this place out.

27:16.874 --> 27:19.231
How long can that take?
Ten minutes, right?

27:20.253 --> 27:21.746
- Why not?
- Okay, good.

27:21.793 --> 27:22.918
I'm already awake.

27:23.272 --> 27:24.273
Let's go.

27:24.317 --> 27:25.778
Should we take my car or, uh...

27:25.952 --> 27:27.263
Your invisible plane?

27:27.437 --> 27:28.570
That's wonder woman.

27:29.515 --> 27:32.422
Well, uh, maybe we can borrow it.
Why don't you give her a call?

27:43.789 --> 27:45.598
There it is, your basic coin shop.

27:45.669 --> 27:46.682
That's the guy!

27:47.089 --> 27:48.400
- That's the guy.
- Monk!

27:48.447 --> 27:51.368
No, no, I mean, that's the other guy.
He was there too.

27:52.773 --> 27:53.952
Monk, what are you doing?

27:54.855 --> 27:56.080
He lives in the back.

27:56.583 --> 27:57.595
We could talk to him.

27:57.626 --> 27:59.628
Well, I'm sure he'll be here
in the morning, Monk.

27:59.643 --> 28:01.190
I would. I would really like to go home

28:01.201 --> 28:03.587
and I'm sure randy would like
to get back to gotham city.

28:03.659 --> 28:05.275
That's batman.
I live in new york.

28:05.491 --> 28:06.752
Uh, he... He does.

28:25.807 --> 28:27.349
Ah, I used to collect coins.

28:27.399 --> 28:28.405
Good for you.

28:28.454 --> 28:30.819
Can somebody please
tell me what is going on?

28:31.379 --> 28:33.353
Theremayhave been a shooting

28:33.409 --> 28:37.167
earlier, around 1:00 am on harrison
street at the bay city cafe.

28:37.222 --> 28:38.357
Well, I've never been there.

28:38.372 --> 28:40.496
Never even heard of it.
I've been in bed since 10:30.

28:40.497 --> 28:42.077
- You live in the back.
- That's right.

28:42.101 --> 28:43.638
- You live alone?
- That's right.

28:43.871 --> 28:45.617
What does any of this
have to do with me?

28:45.739 --> 28:46.843
What?

28:46.958 --> 28:47.962
Oh, yeah...

28:49.811 --> 28:51.106
Do these belong to you?

28:51.857 --> 28:55.028
Well, I mean, they used to.
I sold them.

28:55.105 --> 28:57.154
This is a coin shop.
That's what I do.

28:57.943 --> 28:58.962
What's with the, uh...

28:58.979 --> 29:00.659
We'll ask the questions here,
Mr. Posner.

29:03.047 --> 29:04.491
You sold a lot of coins.

29:04.874 --> 29:05.956
Yeah, I've had a good year.

29:06.006 --> 29:07.483
Must've sold them recently.

29:07.666 --> 29:09.937
You still have all the
little price tags here.

29:10.202 --> 29:13.108
Oh, yeah, yeah, you're right.
I still have to clean that one out.

29:14.236 --> 29:15.875
Do you own a gun, Mr. Posner?

29:16.170 --> 29:17.787
In this neighborhood?
You bet I do.

29:18.103 --> 29:19.103
Could I see it?

29:19.288 --> 29:20.288
Yeah.

29:31.224 --> 29:32.917
Oh, .22.

29:36.313 --> 29:37.326
Nope.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.571
You wanna see the permit?

29:38.690 --> 29:41.047
- Yes.
- That won't be nec...

29:42.504 --> 29:43.538
You got a tissue?

29:44.625 --> 29:45.625
Something?

29:46.763 --> 29:48.257
1965 dime.

29:48.306 --> 29:49.779
Hey, is this worth anything?

29:53.641 --> 29:55.604
What did you mean before
when you said that there

29:55.663 --> 29:57.190
mayhave been a shooting?

29:57.254 --> 29:59.178
Uh, well, we have an eye witness

29:59.211 --> 30:01.633
who's usually very reliable
when he gets enough sleep,

30:01.699 --> 30:05.895
who says that, uh,
he saw an undercover cop get shot.

30:06.299 --> 30:07.325
- Cop?
- Yeah.

30:07.696 --> 30:08.708
Do I need a lawyer?

30:08.762 --> 30:09.990
- You sure do.
- No.

30:10.023 --> 30:12.892
I'm sure it was probably
just a misunderstanding.

30:12.958 --> 30:15.531
In fact, we just left the
victim at the train station.

30:15.564 --> 30:18.103
He was alive and well,
waiting for a train to port...

30:18.145 --> 30:19.367
- He's alive?
- yeah.

30:19.591 --> 30:21.407
- I don't understand.
- You know, to tell you

30:21.440 --> 30:24.173
the truth, I don't understand either.
Sorry to have bothered you.

30:24.206 --> 30:26.220
Thank you for your time.
We'll be leaving now.

30:26.253 --> 30:28.487
- Mr. Posner...
- we will be leaving now.

30:30.739 --> 30:32.343
Oh, hey,
the dime.

30:32.471 --> 30:33.516
What do you think?

30:33.818 --> 30:35.809
It might be worth a million dollars.

30:35.842 --> 30:36.854
Really?

30:37.670 --> 30:39.844
If you use it to scratch
off a winning lottery ticket.

30:43.206 --> 30:46.939
Monk, I am begging you, by all
that's holy,it's 4:30 in the morning.

30:46.989 --> 30:49.445
4:30! I've gotta get back
to the train station!

30:51.931 --> 30:52.943
Where's he going?

30:53.403 --> 30:54.715
I don't know...

30:54.831 --> 30:56.026
And I don't care.

30:58.928 --> 31:00.272
Essie,
hey!

31:00.386 --> 31:01.487
Excuse me, essie!

31:01.520 --> 31:03.063
You just missed her.

31:03.097 --> 31:04.419
There she goes.

31:04.787 --> 31:05.899
Wait!

31:06.578 --> 31:07.873
Maria!

31:13.306 --> 31:14.783
Good morning, mickey.

31:15.136 --> 31:17.023
- Morning.
- I'll have the usual.

31:17.153 --> 31:21.121
And, uh, one for my grandson here.
He's celebrating. He just made Captain.

31:21.191 --> 31:22.320
You got it.

31:25.470 --> 31:27.096
- Scotch?
- Yep.

31:27.643 --> 31:28.655
Single malt.

31:29.098 --> 31:31.046
One shot.
We drink this down,

31:31.082 --> 31:33.677
watch the fish swim around,
and we go home and go to sleep.

31:33.777 --> 31:35.785
Mickey, I got this one.

31:36.886 --> 31:37.898
Do I know you?

31:38.256 --> 31:39.256
You do now.

31:39.566 --> 31:41.182
Whatever they want,
keep 'em coming.

31:41.317 --> 31:43.209
Yes, sir, Mr. Monk.

31:45.619 --> 31:46.619
Mr. Monk?

31:47.241 --> 31:48.736
We got a friend named Monk.

31:48.769 --> 31:49.770
Yes, we do.

31:49.786 --> 31:51.043
What are the odds of that?

31:51.237 --> 31:52.698
You guys like to gamble?

32:26.224 --> 32:28.124
Copy that, on my way!

32:52.557 --> 32:53.635
Oh, my god!

32:53.992 --> 32:56.167
Shouldn't somebody call the cops?

32:56.632 --> 32:57.632
Not me.

32:58.328 --> 32:59.755
They'd never believe it.

33:05.074 --> 33:06.825
There's been a shooting.

33:08.159 --> 33:10.150
I need a crime scene unit
and some paramedics.

33:16.255 --> 33:18.148
- What are you doing?
- Trust me.

33:18.226 --> 33:20.188
This guy's been doing this all night.

33:21.609 --> 33:22.609
Hello!

33:22.651 --> 33:24.914
Rise and shine.
Come on, Mr. Lee, show's over.

33:24.948 --> 33:26.464
Please don't do that.
Just step back,

33:26.514 --> 33:27.561
- Okay?
- He's not dead.

33:27.663 --> 33:30.141
- He can't be.
- Come on. Sir!

33:30.678 --> 33:32.807
- Come on!
- Please, sir, don't do that.

33:32.864 --> 33:34.435
He's acting.
hey!

33:34.673 --> 33:36.515
Hume cronyn,
that's a wrap.

33:36.549 --> 33:38.732
Come on.
Mister, I'm not gonna ask you again.

33:39.005 --> 33:41.641
Now, believe me, he's dead.
He's been shot at least three times.

33:42.410 --> 33:43.804
Looks like a.22 caliber.

33:46.117 --> 33:47.412
22 caliber.

33:53.453 --> 33:54.453
Tap it twice.

33:55.833 --> 33:56.846
And...

33:57.447 --> 33:58.569
Is that your card?

34:00.305 --> 34:02.318
- How'd you do that?
- It's magic, baby.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.618
Okay,
double or nothing.

34:07.006 --> 34:08.795
I'm gonna shuffle them this time.

34:08.842 --> 34:09.842
Really shuffle 'em.

34:12.103 --> 34:14.360
- Hello?
- Leland, it's me.

34:14.561 --> 34:17.233
I know what's going on,
I figured it out.

34:17.681 --> 34:18.947
Monk, I told you...

34:19.003 --> 34:20.862
Go home, go to bed that's an order.

34:20.888 --> 34:23.545
No, no, we have to get
back to that restaurant.

34:23.745 --> 34:26.599
He's gonna kill them all
if he hasn't already.

34:26.692 --> 34:28.460
Who?
Who's gonna kill them all?

34:28.509 --> 34:30.545
Posner!
The coin dealer.

34:30.629 --> 34:35.003
Listen, I can't do this anymore.
I am very, very, very off duty.

34:35.061 --> 34:36.748
I will talk to you in the morning.

34:38.427 --> 34:39.438
Whoo.

34:41.024 --> 34:42.750
- Uno mas.
- One more.

34:48.696 --> 34:49.708
Taxi!

34:50.987 --> 34:52.498
Taxi, taxi,

34:53.146 --> 34:54.723
it's an emergency.

34:55.782 --> 34:58.099
- You got money?
- Of course I have money.

35:01.148 --> 35:02.210
Oh, god...

35:05.014 --> 35:06.060
Hey!

35:06.525 --> 35:07.525
Hey!

35:08.934 --> 35:10.905
- Poindexter?
- I need a ride.

35:11.057 --> 35:13.425
- Police emergency.
- Are you a cop?

35:13.639 --> 35:17.577
I'm an ex-cop.
It's an ex-police emergency.

35:20.455 --> 35:21.517
Where is it?

35:22.303 --> 35:25.070
I don't know, man.
Why don't you look in the cherries?

35:42.747 --> 35:44.689
These napkins are the same.

35:48.285 --> 35:50.725
Hey, he said he'd never been there.

35:52.514 --> 35:53.514
Who said?

35:54.518 --> 35:55.962
That coin dealer.

35:57.882 --> 35:59.206
Sorry, Mr. Monk.

35:59.963 --> 36:01.191
We gotta go.

36:02.516 --> 36:03.727
I though Randy.

36:05.511 --> 36:06.623
We gotta go.

36:09.478 --> 36:10.769
Bye, mickey.

36:17.639 --> 36:18.911
Just hurry!

36:18.978 --> 36:22.526
It's on harrison street.
Called the bay city cafe.

36:23.011 --> 36:25.053
You mind telling us what's going on?

36:25.087 --> 36:27.447
Gully was right.
It's a different city after dark.

36:27.835 --> 36:28.957
Who's gully?

36:29.019 --> 36:30.758
He's the guy who stole my wallet.

36:31.128 --> 36:32.506
I learned a lot from him.

36:32.825 --> 36:34.082
Here's what happened.

36:34.577 --> 36:36.286
Nothing I saw was real.

36:36.749 --> 36:38.160
It was all a con game.

36:38.567 --> 36:39.846
There were three of them.

36:40.001 --> 36:43.144
Grifters looking for an easy mark.

36:44.244 --> 36:45.244
And they found one.

36:46.428 --> 36:49.645
A coin dealer named jacob posner.

36:50.105 --> 36:52.246
Posner thought he was buying drugs.

36:52.950 --> 36:54.950
But it was all a show for his benefit.

36:56.447 --> 36:58.721
They wanted posner to think

36:59.303 --> 37:01.046
that he was in serious trouble.

37:02.932 --> 37:06.833
They told posner they could cover
it up and make it all go away

37:06.999 --> 37:08.277
for a price.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.280
They were all on it.

37:11.820 --> 37:13.037
The drug dealer,

37:13.208 --> 37:17.790
the so-called cop,
and the waitress, Zeena Davis.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.172
They only had a few minutes,

37:20.373 --> 37:24.357
but it was enough time to clean
up all the blood before I got back.

37:28.861 --> 37:31.710
Posner thought he was
paying them hush money.

37:32.944 --> 37:35.400
He gave them dozens of coins.

37:35.592 --> 37:37.990
Rare coins, they must've
been worth a fortune.

37:39.615 --> 37:41.488
He had no idea he'd been conned

37:41.538 --> 37:42.616
until later...

37:43.730 --> 37:44.958
When we showed up.

37:45.428 --> 37:49.544
We mentioned that the dead cop
was, in fact, alive and well

37:49.859 --> 37:52.803
and we just had seen him
at the train station.

37:54.125 --> 37:56.050
Posner realized he'd been conned.

37:56.473 --> 37:57.865
He didn't take it very well.

38:04.333 --> 38:05.713
That's a hell of a story.

38:06.382 --> 38:09.070
I guess I'll be reading all
about it tomorrow night.

38:11.574 --> 38:12.574
Here we are.

38:12.699 --> 38:14.043
Can you go around back?

38:20.913 --> 38:24.215
Come on, come on.
Hey, relax, man. You'll get your coins.

38:24.282 --> 38:26.093
You're damn right I will.
Just keep walking.

38:40.643 --> 38:41.716
Nice shot.

38:56.752 --> 38:58.024
Going somewhere?

39:17.718 --> 39:18.718
Excuse me!

39:20.836 --> 39:22.595
Somebody owes me $10.

39:23.209 --> 39:24.209
Maria!

39:25.895 --> 39:26.895
Do I know you?

39:26.993 --> 39:28.620
I've been looking for you all night.

39:28.669 --> 39:29.682
For me?
why?

39:31.516 --> 39:32.572
I don't know why.

39:32.884 --> 39:35.230
I mean...
I don't know.

39:38.373 --> 39:40.632
"12-14-97"

39:42.238 --> 39:44.728
It was the day my wife died.

39:45.256 --> 39:46.898
That's the day I was reborn.

39:47.390 --> 39:50.298
At least that's how it felt.
I had a disease.

39:50.418 --> 39:52.041
Retinitis pigmentosa.

39:52.413 --> 39:53.593
I was going blind.

39:53.753 --> 39:56.600
- And then...
- And you had a cornea transplant.

39:58.825 --> 40:00.302
From Trudy?

40:01.212 --> 40:02.285
That's right.

40:03.769 --> 40:05.091
Trudy Monk.

40:05.522 --> 40:08.376
- My wife?
- I have her corneas.

40:11.385 --> 40:12.939
Trudy's eyes.

40:32.028 --> 40:33.589
I am so sorry.

40:47.610 --> 40:48.622
Hello?

40:50.796 --> 40:51.809
Mr. Monk?

40:53.822 --> 40:55.017
Mr. Monk?

41:10.059 --> 41:11.596
See?
Told ya.

41:12.617 --> 41:13.739
A little fresh air.

41:15.115 --> 41:16.237
Works every time.
