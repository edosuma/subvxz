00:04.526 --> 00:07.137
<i>In the nation's
largest city,</i>

00:07.137 --> 00:09.879
<i>the vicious and violent
members of the underworld</i>

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
<i>are hunted by the detectives</i>

00:11.489 --> 00:14.710
<i>of the Organized Crime
Control Bureau.</i>

00:14.710 --> 00:16.407
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:20.063 --> 00:22.892
<i>On the floor, now!</i>

00:23.762 --> 00:25.764
We've got some gangsters
who are posing as cops.

00:25.764 --> 00:28.158
No! Get off him!

00:28.158 --> 00:29.594
Vaughn, what are you doing?

00:31.118 --> 00:34.077
So robbing, raping,
and now murder.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.383
Police! Don't move!

00:37.907 --> 00:39.256
<i>It's Dante.</i>

00:39.256 --> 00:41.084
<i>We were in the same
foster home.</i>

00:41.084 --> 00:42.999
We were brothers.
- Who's the white kid?

00:42.999 --> 00:44.392
<i>Vaughn Davis.</i>

00:44.392 --> 00:45.871
<i>What happened in that house,</i>

00:45.871 --> 00:47.264
I think it's why
he's doing this.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.744
What happened in that house?

01:16.641 --> 01:19.340
All right, I need tight
groups, head on a swivel.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.864
His crew has
a lot of firepower.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.866
Captain, on your mark.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.259
10-4. Moving to positions.

01:44.843 --> 01:45.801
On my signal.

01:47.629 --> 01:48.804
Go, go, go!

01:50.197 --> 01:51.676
NYPD!

01:53.287 --> 01:56.377
Two up! On the left!

01:56.377 --> 01:58.248
We have a warrant!

01:58.248 --> 01:59.771
Two, right!

01:59.771 --> 02:04.298
Clear!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.345
Room clear, room clear!

02:10.608 --> 02:12.306
Back is clear!

02:15.439 --> 02:16.832
<i>Show me what you got, guys.</i>

02:18.790 --> 02:20.444
Come on, guys.

02:20.444 --> 02:22.403
Hey, put your hands up, Ray.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.927
Come on, is this all you got?

02:24.927 --> 02:27.190
Come on, show me something.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.322
Come on, Vaughn.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.324
You got to hit him! Let's go!

02:30.324 --> 02:32.500
Hit him!

02:34.937 --> 02:36.243
You okay?

02:36.243 --> 02:38.941
Yeah.

02:38.941 --> 02:40.812
Graceland for dirtbags.

02:42.031 --> 02:43.989
Thank you, Captain.
We'll take it from here.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.696
Hello?

02:54.696 --> 02:56.785
<i>Aren't you supposed
to answer "Detective Reyes?"</i>

02:56.785 --> 02:59.004
<i>That has such
a nice ring to it.</i>

02:59.004 --> 03:00.484
Vaughn.

03:00.484 --> 03:01.964
<i>It's nice to see you again,
Little Ray.</i>

03:01.964 --> 03:03.661
<i>Sorry I'm not home.</i>

03:03.661 --> 03:05.185
Where are you?

03:05.185 --> 03:07.056
<i>I'm with you in spirit.</i>

03:07.056 --> 03:08.492
Dante gave you up,

03:08.492 --> 03:10.190
and I'm pretty sure
the rest will too.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.452
It's only a matter of time.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.062
<i>Times have changed, my man.</i>

03:13.062 --> 03:14.498
<i>The crew I have now is tight,</i>

03:14.498 --> 03:16.631
<i>and we're gonna turn up
the heat.</i>

03:16.631 --> 03:18.763
What do you mean by
turning up the heat?

03:18.763 --> 03:21.113
<i>I got all the money
I need now,</i>

03:21.113 --> 03:22.680
<i>enough to last a lifetime.</i>

03:22.680 --> 03:26.075
<i>So what's next ain't
about getting paid.</i>

03:26.075 --> 03:27.424
<i>It's personal.</i>

03:27.424 --> 03:29.992
<i>Because it's about payback,</i>

03:29.992 --> 03:34.039
<i>especially to that bald pig
that shot Dante.</i>

03:34.039 --> 03:36.172
You mean me?
You want to meet me? Where?

03:36.172 --> 03:38.043
Just tell me where.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.523
<i>We don't have to meet</i>

03:39.523 --> 03:42.787
<i>because I'm gonna take care
of this right now.</i>

03:42.787 --> 03:46.226
<i>You come after my brothers,
I come after yours.</i>

03:46.226 --> 03:48.358
<i>And I don't stop.</i>

03:48.358 --> 03:51.274
<i>Time to start killing cops.</i>

03:51.274 --> 03:52.754
Everybody out.

03:52.754 --> 03:54.538
Everybody out! Out, now!
- Let's go!

03:54.538 --> 03:55.974
- Let's go! Come on!
- Get out of here!

03:57.889 --> 04:00.849
All teams move out now!

04:00.849 --> 04:02.285
Where's Jet?

04:07.334 --> 04:08.900
- Jet!
- Move! Let's move!

04:08.900 --> 04:10.162
Come on.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.860
Go! Let's go!
Get out of here!

04:11.860 --> 04:13.253
You okay?

04:18.083 --> 04:19.433
Must not have wired it right.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.825
No, he was watching us.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.915
He knew we were gonna make it outside.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.268
The car!
- Oh!

05:21.843 --> 05:24.019
Everyone all right?
You all right?

05:24.019 --> 05:25.760
Hey, get the bomb squad
back in there

05:25.760 --> 05:28.023
to check for secondary devices
and call FD.

05:28.023 --> 05:30.808
- What's in your hand?
- Camera from the chandelier.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.289
We'll get better tracing data
from orders to providers

05:33.289 --> 05:34.986
if I can find out
who bought it.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.424
You stayed in there with
a ticking bomb to grab that?

05:37.424 --> 05:39.382
Get Vaughn's photo out
to the state police.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.863
If it's all right, I'd like
to get back to the hospital,

05:41.863 --> 05:43.473
see if I can get anything
outside of Dante now.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.736
You think he set us up?

05:45.736 --> 05:47.869
Look, any information
you get from him now,

05:47.869 --> 05:50.611
the DA is gonna say it's biased
because of your relationship.

05:50.611 --> 05:52.177
Let Stabler do it.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.266
With all due respect,
he was able to get the address,

05:54.266 --> 05:56.704
but Dante will tell me things
he won't tell anyone else.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.706
But what good is it
if we can't use it in court?

05:58.706 --> 06:00.055
You really think you can
get more information out

06:00.055 --> 06:01.752
of him than I can?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.363
I do.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.016
Your call.

06:05.016 --> 06:07.105
All right, if he can
help us catch a cop killer,

06:07.105 --> 06:09.369
then I'll just deal
with the DA later.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.762
We got to alert the captain.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.503
Vaughn shows his face
between here and Florida,

06:13.503 --> 06:15.157
we'll get him.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.854
Yeah, I think you're right.
Let's head back to the city.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.334
I'll call Lillian.
- All right.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.031
Hey, hey. You good?

06:20.031 --> 06:22.164
- I'm fine.
- Good. Hey, gutsy move.

06:22.164 --> 06:23.295
Thank you.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.689
- Don't ever do it again.
- Okay.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.213
There's no going back now.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.389
We are at war.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.696
You sure you really
want to do this?

06:34.481 --> 06:36.221
After all the cops
done to me?

06:36.221 --> 06:38.049
Hell yeah.

06:38.049 --> 06:39.181
It's about damn time.

06:42.924 --> 06:45.361
They deserve everything
that's coming now.

06:54.283 --> 06:57.504
Man, I told your partners
everything I know.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.725
Look, I'm gonna be
real with you.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.379
There was a bomb at the house.

07:03.379 --> 07:04.815
A bomb?

07:04.815 --> 07:07.688
Yeah, and when we arrived,
Vaughn detonated it.

07:09.341 --> 07:10.734
So if you sent us
there knowing--

07:10.734 --> 07:13.476
I didn't know
anything about a bomb.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.957
Look, I was trying to help.

07:15.957 --> 07:17.175
Is everyone okay?

07:17.175 --> 07:18.786
We got real lucky.

07:20.831 --> 07:22.529
You need to know
that I haven't spoken

07:22.529 --> 07:25.053
to Vaughn in years,

07:25.053 --> 07:26.924
not until right before
I got out.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.578
And I didn't know
he was rolling like that

07:28.578 --> 07:29.797
till I got to his crib.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.713
Look, B, I know it's messed up.

07:32.713 --> 07:35.324
But you know I'm not down
with that violence at all.

07:35.324 --> 07:37.718
But--
- You were brothers.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.024
So you had to go along with it?

07:41.025 --> 07:42.853
Isn't that how
it's always been?

07:55.779 --> 07:57.607
Vaughn wants
to kill cops now.

07:59.174 --> 08:00.958
Work with me to find him,

08:00.958 --> 08:02.830
and I'll do all I can
to make sure you good

08:02.830 --> 08:04.484
when you get out of here.

08:07.443 --> 08:10.141
It's like back
in the day, right?

08:10.141 --> 08:12.143
Please!

08:12.143 --> 08:13.580
Don't!

08:13.580 --> 08:14.929
Please!

08:21.979 --> 08:24.025
Get over here.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.548
Let me out!

08:25.548 --> 08:27.289
Stop! Stop!

08:29.117 --> 08:30.640
Let go!

08:30.640 --> 08:32.163
Shut up.

08:32.163 --> 08:34.296
Let go of me!

08:38.735 --> 08:41.172
We're done.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.652
We've been done.

08:47.048 --> 08:49.311
<i>Vaughn wants
to kill cops now?</i>

08:49.311 --> 08:51.182
What makes you so sure?

08:51.182 --> 08:52.793
He tried to blow us up.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.534
He was on the phone
before it happened.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.100
We heard him say it.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.580
Anyone get it on tape?

08:57.580 --> 08:59.016
- No.
- Tape?

08:59.016 --> 09:00.757
I mean, I can put out
a department-wide warning,

09:00.757 --> 09:04.021
but maybe Vaughn
was just interested in you.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.589
You did kill one
of his crew members, right?

09:06.589 --> 09:08.156
No, I actually
shot one of his crew,

09:08.156 --> 09:10.201
but I arrested two of them,
so maybe Vaughn

09:10.201 --> 09:11.855
has something out for me.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.379
But he did try to blow up
a number

09:14.379 --> 09:16.686
of law enforcement officers
in the house.

09:16.686 --> 09:18.862
Now, to me, that's a problem.

09:18.862 --> 09:21.082
I also think he has
a connection in the department.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.867
I mean, the tactical gear--
what is that?

09:23.867 --> 09:26.087
- Elliot.
- No, no, what's going on?

09:26.087 --> 09:28.306
Why is it every time
a cop is either in trouble

09:28.306 --> 09:31.745
or being investigated
in the city, you're involved?

09:31.745 --> 09:33.224
Even when we know
it's a bad guy,

09:33.224 --> 09:35.226
you still look at this
department for suspects.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.619
I'm looking for leads.

09:36.619 --> 09:38.882
You want a lead, well,
figure this out.

09:38.882 --> 09:41.058
How's it gonna go over once
we tell every man and woman

09:41.058 --> 09:42.843
with a shield that
Elliot Stabler

09:42.843 --> 09:44.714
thinks they're targets now?

09:44.714 --> 09:46.803
I don't give a damn
what they think.

09:46.803 --> 09:48.152
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

09:53.157 --> 09:55.333
- What he's trying to say is--
- Look, I know what he meant.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.207
I'm gonna run this
up the chain on my end.

09:59.207 --> 10:01.818
But my gut is telling me
we need to keep this

10:01.818 --> 10:03.994
at a whisper right now.

10:03.994 --> 10:06.518
And if you need more resources
to help you find this guy,

10:06.518 --> 10:08.782
just give us a call,

10:08.782 --> 10:10.740
especially if you're
not getting

10:10.740 --> 10:12.350
the help you need right now.

10:18.922 --> 10:20.707
I can manage him.

10:22.186 --> 10:23.884
You really shouldn't have
backed me up like that.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.843
I mean, people are gonna
start to think that you care.

10:26.843 --> 10:28.976
We got what we wanted.

10:32.283 --> 10:33.676
Jet, got a theory.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.199
I need your help.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.158
Vaughn's got a connection
to the department.

10:37.158 --> 10:39.290
That's how he gets his uniform,
shields, whatever.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.336
I just need you to dig
into his record.

10:41.336 --> 10:44.339
You know, maybe he
got busted, turned CI,

10:44.339 --> 10:46.558
and used that pull
in order to get supplies

10:46.558 --> 10:47.995
from someone on the job.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.083
Got it?

10:49.083 --> 10:50.824
All right, you and me.
Let's roll.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.347
Where we headed?

10:54.697 --> 10:56.003
Great, love it.

10:58.919 --> 11:00.442
You get anything?

11:00.442 --> 11:01.573
Vaughn's call at the house

11:01.573 --> 11:02.836
didn't last long enough
to trace.

11:02.836 --> 11:04.011
Camera came from Amazon,

11:04.011 --> 11:06.404
shipped to a PO box, unregistered.

11:06.404 --> 11:08.798
Okay, what are you saying?

11:08.798 --> 11:11.105
That I almost died
for nothing.

11:13.107 --> 11:14.238
<i>I don't have time for this.</i>

11:14.238 --> 11:16.110
I'm already late
for a bail hearing.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.633
We've got a crew out there
targeting cops,

11:17.633 --> 11:19.504
so we don't have
much time, either.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.028
You got one minute.

11:21.028 --> 11:23.726
Your client, Manny,
is part of this gang.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.119
Allegedly.

11:25.119 --> 11:26.990
Well, we'd like
to have him on board.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.166
Now, we've got another
gang member, Dante.

11:29.166 --> 11:30.864
And if we get information
from him first,

11:30.864 --> 11:32.474
then all bets are off.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.955
Just get us a name, address,
somewhere we can get Vaughn.

11:34.955 --> 11:38.045
As I said before,
my client Manny does not know

11:38.045 --> 11:39.916
this Vaughn person
from the foster home.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.789
Well, your client left
his DNA at a crime scene

11:42.789 --> 11:44.878
where a young woman
was murdered.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.315
He's also a member
of this crew that attempted

11:47.315 --> 11:49.056
to blow up a dozen cops.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.449
Now, I don't need to tell you,
if he doesn't work with us,

11:51.449 --> 11:53.103
he's gonna be an accessory
to all that.

11:53.103 --> 11:54.452
Then offer me something.

11:54.452 --> 11:56.150
Or what am I supposed to do--
tell my client

11:56.150 --> 11:58.630
you asked nicely,
so cough up some information?

11:58.630 --> 12:00.850
And we're waiting for an
offer from the DA's office.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.634
But in the meantime--

12:02.634 --> 12:04.549
If time is that important,

12:04.549 --> 12:07.727
I'll expect something big
for my client in return.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.945
Good luck, detectives.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.384
Who sets their alarm
for one minute?

12:13.384 --> 12:14.429
She does.

12:15.778 --> 12:16.866
Any luck?

12:16.866 --> 12:18.215
Dante was a bust.

12:18.215 --> 12:20.087
Well, Manny's lawyer
claims that

12:20.087 --> 12:22.698
he doesn't know anything about
Vaughn in any foster home.

12:22.698 --> 12:23.960
We know that's not the truth.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.527
How do you know that?

12:25.527 --> 12:27.181
<i>When the sarge and I
went there the other day,</i>

12:27.181 --> 12:28.878
we spoke with Leonard, and he
definitely knew who Manny was.

12:28.878 --> 12:31.141
- Leonard was still there?
- Yeah, he was--hey.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.361
And there were kids inside?

12:33.361 --> 12:36.103
Stabler,
were there kids inside?

12:36.103 --> 12:37.887
I need you to just
call Jet and see how

12:37.887 --> 12:39.323
my theory's working out there.

12:39.323 --> 12:42.413
Hey, Reyes.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.545
<i>Reyes.</i>

12:43.545 --> 12:45.765
Sorry, I got another call.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.897
Let me take this, and I'll
meet you back at the office.

12:47.897 --> 12:49.464
<i>Cool?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

12:56.384 --> 12:59.126
I'm telling you,
the kid's like Jeter.

12:59.126 --> 13:02.085
Same stance, same bad speed.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.260
He's got a future.

13:03.260 --> 13:05.828
Eddie, he's seven.
It's tee ball.

13:05.828 --> 13:08.613
Greatness starts
when it starts, bro.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.006
Excuse me, officer.

13:15.490 --> 13:16.534
10-85.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.275
Shots fired! Shots fired!

13:25.021 --> 13:26.718
What do we know?

13:26.718 --> 13:27.937
It was a straight-up
ambush, black van.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.634
Didn't get a plate number.
- Everyone okay?

13:29.634 --> 13:31.375
Yeah, the officers
took a couple rounds,

13:31.375 --> 13:33.290
but thank God for their vests.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.944
Hey, just to confirm,
you said you saw

13:34.944 --> 13:36.293
three individuals in the car?

13:36.293 --> 13:38.469
At least.
It happened so fast.

13:38.469 --> 13:40.123
Are there cameras
on the street?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.690
Yeah, where are we
with the cameras?

13:41.690 --> 13:43.518
Uniforms are going
business to business,

13:43.518 --> 13:45.650
see if any security cameras
were facing this direction.

13:45.650 --> 13:47.000
You'll never guess
what we found

13:47.000 --> 13:48.305
littering the crime scene.

13:48.305 --> 13:49.654
Well, based on your tone,

13:49.654 --> 13:51.700
I'm assuming MAC-10
shell casings.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.702
Yeah, littered
all over the place.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.791
So this was Vaughn's crew.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.141
Yeah, hey--

13:58.141 --> 13:59.751
Sarge, can I give you
a call back?

13:59.751 --> 14:00.840
<i>Yeah, go.</i>

14:02.711 --> 14:03.755
Jet, what's up?

14:03.755 --> 14:05.148
You should have me investigate

14:05.148 --> 14:06.367
your theories more often.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.934
Well, thanks.
What do you have?

14:07.934 --> 14:11.067
Vaughn was in the police
academy just over a year ago.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.287
- New York?
<i>- Yeah, but he got kicked out.</i>

14:13.287 --> 14:15.028
Evidently, there was
some drama involved

14:15.028 --> 14:16.725
because his record was sealed.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.858
What's that mean, drama?
What kind of drama?

14:18.858 --> 14:21.991
I think that's
where you take over.

14:21.991 --> 14:23.645
Copy, thanks.

14:55.155 --> 14:56.417
What's up?

14:56.417 --> 14:58.332
Name's Bobby.
I was looking for Leonard.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.594
Is he home?

15:01.335 --> 15:02.423
What's your name?

15:03.641 --> 15:05.730
You need to leave
before I call the cops.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.516
Already here.

15:10.997 --> 15:11.911
Mind if I come in?

15:16.785 --> 15:19.396
I told you,
Leonard's not home.

15:19.396 --> 15:20.920
Know when he'll be back?

15:25.794 --> 15:27.535
Who's this?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.798
He's just sleeping.

15:29.798 --> 15:33.236
Hey.

15:35.499 --> 15:36.805
Where'd he get these?

15:38.676 --> 15:40.330
Do you have them, too?

15:45.770 --> 15:47.990
Those are cigarette burns.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.992
You want to know how I know?

15:49.992 --> 15:52.299
'Cause I have them too.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.778
Did Leonard do this to you?

16:00.655 --> 16:02.309
Has he hurt you in any way?

16:04.180 --> 16:07.444
Does he touch you when
you don't want him to?

16:09.359 --> 16:11.231
Hey, you're not in any trouble.

16:11.231 --> 16:13.146
I'm gonna help you.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.931
Okay, I got some friends coming
from the department right now.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.849
He will never touch you like
that ever again, I promise.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.618
NYPD!

16:52.315 --> 16:54.143
Hey, hey, you okay?

17:06.721 --> 17:08.679
Those guys in the ambush,
they're doing okay?

17:08.679 --> 17:10.812
They're shook up,
but they're fine.

17:10.812 --> 17:12.379
You know, we train them
for so much,

17:12.379 --> 17:15.643
but you can never prepare them
for psychopaths like that.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.079
You know,
the way things are now,

17:17.079 --> 17:18.602
it wasn't like that
when I first started.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.039
I mean,
you got to understand that.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.866
Well, you know,
bad guys are still bad guys.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.433
But I hear what you're saying.

17:23.433 --> 17:26.088
I pulled his sleeve when you
talked to me on the phone,

17:26.088 --> 17:27.655
but I can tell you
everything you need to know.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.091
What do you got?

17:29.091 --> 17:32.312
Vaughn, cocky, lazy.

17:32.312 --> 17:33.878
Enjoyed the idea
of having a shield

17:33.878 --> 17:35.967
but not necessarily
working to earn it.

17:35.967 --> 17:38.144
And I'm seeing that
more and more these days,

17:38.144 --> 17:40.711
these millennials
or whatever you call them,

17:40.711 --> 17:43.540
Gen Z.
Proud card-carrying member.

17:43.540 --> 17:45.542
So Vaughn had
an attitude problem.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.675
Yeah.
I run a tight ship here.

17:47.675 --> 17:50.373
You get out of line,
you're gonna get corrected,

17:50.373 --> 17:53.115
first by your superior,
then me,

17:53.115 --> 17:54.377
and then your classmates.

17:54.377 --> 17:56.075
Corrected how?

17:56.075 --> 17:58.120
It starts with a talking to
and then a write-up.

17:58.120 --> 18:04.431
And I heard a rumor about
a Brillo bath in extreme cases.

18:06.607 --> 18:08.304
A classmate isn't
pulling his weight,

18:08.304 --> 18:10.741
the other classmates
lure him into the showers,

18:10.741 --> 18:13.396
and they scrub him down
with Brillos.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.920
You know, sends a message.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.098
I heard the higher ups
shut that down years ago.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.621
Officially, they did.

18:20.621 --> 18:22.884
But unofficially,
it still goes on, right?

18:22.884 --> 18:24.494
And not without
your permission?

18:26.322 --> 18:29.847
Vaughn was a problem
that we couldn't correct.

18:29.847 --> 18:32.502
When he found out he was gonna
get kicked out, he quit.

18:32.502 --> 18:36.332
And he promised that we all
were gonna be sorry someday.

18:36.332 --> 18:37.855
What about classmates of his?

18:37.855 --> 18:39.944
Anyone he's still
in contact with,

18:39.944 --> 18:41.381
someone in the department now?

18:41.381 --> 18:46.125
Nah, he became a pariah
after the Brillo incident.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.910
But there was one guy
that he was tight with,

18:48.910 --> 18:51.173
and then he dropped out afterwards.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.132
Fink, that's his name--

18:53.132 --> 18:54.568
Paul Fink.

18:54.568 --> 18:55.569
Can you pull his file?

18:55.569 --> 18:56.613
Yeah.

19:01.183 --> 19:04.230
What are you
looking at over there?

19:04.230 --> 19:06.014
We all over the internet.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.102
Cops are pissed.

19:07.102 --> 19:09.409
They're coming for us.
- Good.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.150
It's what we want.

19:13.195 --> 19:14.283
What?

19:14.283 --> 19:15.850
Maybe we just lay low
for a while.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.068
Yeah.

19:17.068 --> 19:20.202
And what,
wait for them to catch us?

19:20.202 --> 19:22.944
All right, what if
Miles and I just lay low?

19:22.944 --> 19:24.511
Look, we want to lay low,
all right?

19:24.511 --> 19:25.773
At least just until--

19:28.515 --> 19:30.473
Now you can lay low
all you want!

19:49.144 --> 19:50.624
What'd he do now?

19:50.624 --> 19:51.929
Who's that?

19:51.929 --> 19:53.888
Paul.
That's why you're here, right?

19:53.888 --> 19:55.106
What'd he do now?

19:55.106 --> 19:56.891
That boy's always
getting into trouble.

19:56.891 --> 19:57.892
So Paul Fink does live here?

19:57.892 --> 19:59.633
When I let him.

19:59.633 --> 20:00.721
He here now?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.070
He's down at the pool hall,

20:02.070 --> 20:04.594
probably losing money
like he does.

20:04.594 --> 20:06.727
Are you gonna tell me
what this is about?

20:06.727 --> 20:08.468
'Cause we got rent due.

20:08.468 --> 20:09.730
And I can't have him
go to prison

20:09.730 --> 20:11.471
until he pays his share.

20:11.471 --> 20:12.907
Where's the pool hall?

20:20.262 --> 20:21.742
Hey, where are you?

20:21.742 --> 20:24.048
Oh, yeah, sorry.

20:24.048 --> 20:25.659
I was following up on a lead,
and I didn't want

20:25.659 --> 20:27.226
to check in until I knew more.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.097
Okay, well, if you can't
get it, don't waste your time.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.272
I need you here.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.926
10-4, making it quick.

20:38.976 --> 20:42.153
With the stripes? Okay.

20:49.813 --> 20:51.119
Double or nothing.

20:51.119 --> 20:53.077
- Nah.
- Come on.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.905
Luckiest game of your life,
you schmuck!

20:54.905 --> 20:56.820
Looks like he ran the table
on you there, Paul.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.169
That was a lot, huh?

20:58.169 --> 21:00.041
Detective Stabler,
that's Detective Whelan.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.392
Listen, guys, I don't
know what's going on.

21:03.392 --> 21:05.307
Hey, we're just talking.
We're just--

21:05.307 --> 21:07.440
- Ugh!
- Hey!

21:07.440 --> 21:08.484
You okay?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.271
Oh!

21:13.663 --> 21:14.795
That was impressive.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.797
Not really.
I was aiming for his leg.

21:16.797 --> 21:18.886
Well.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.670
Assaulting a police officer,
you know what that's

21:20.670 --> 21:22.542
gonna get you now, right?

21:22.542 --> 21:24.195
I'm gonna mention
a name to you.

21:24.195 --> 21:27.503
You help us out,
I forget the whole thing.

21:29.636 --> 21:30.680
Vaughn Davis.

21:32.247 --> 21:33.727
- Vaughn who?
- You know him.

21:33.727 --> 21:36.425
You both washed out
of the academy together.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.822
Paul, the silent
treatment is only

21:41.822 --> 21:43.650
gonna get you assault
with a deadly weapon

21:43.650 --> 21:44.868
and resisting arrest.

21:44.868 --> 21:46.783
Okay, okay, I know him.

21:46.783 --> 21:49.351
But, like, I don't know him.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.874
I have no idea
what that means.

21:50.874 --> 21:52.223
Not a clue.

21:52.223 --> 21:53.486
Paul, we don't know
what that means.

21:53.486 --> 21:55.052
You know, they got cameras
in that place.

21:55.052 --> 21:57.838
So maybe a jury says
it's not assault.

21:57.838 --> 21:59.405
I'm done talking.

22:00.928 --> 22:02.321
Wait.
Let me give it a shot.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.800
- He's done talking.
- Let me give this a shot.

22:03.800 --> 22:05.324
He said he's done talking!

22:05.324 --> 22:07.282
Let me give it a shot,
one shot.

22:10.938 --> 22:13.332
One shot, smart guy.

22:14.724 --> 22:16.857
Look, I'm gonna lower
the volume here, okay?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.598
I just have a question
I know you're gonna answer.

22:18.598 --> 22:21.078
And if you do,
maybe I can help you out.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.126
On a scale of 1 to 10,
how pissed is Maria,

22:25.126 --> 22:27.171
your girlfriend?

22:27.171 --> 22:28.521
How do you know Maria?

22:28.521 --> 22:30.784
Now, look, we're gonna
book you for assault.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.176
It's gonna happen.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.831
If you give me a name,
a place Vaughn frequents,

22:34.831 --> 22:38.226
someone he rolls with,
I'll smooth it all out--

22:38.226 --> 22:41.185
Maria, assault, all of it.

22:41.185 --> 22:42.752
Otherwise, you're on your own.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.191
The person you want
to talk to

22:47.191 --> 22:49.716
is a guy named Nate Reynolds.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.283
Him and Vaughn got real tight
after the academy.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.132
I have no idea
who you're talking about.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.177
Well, what was
your number doing

23:16.177 --> 23:18.571
on our guy, Paul's phone?

23:18.571 --> 23:19.659
Mm-mm-mm.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.576
What about Vaughn Davis?

23:23.576 --> 23:25.273
Well, that's the guy
the Department says

23:25.273 --> 23:27.580
is targeting cops now, right?

23:27.580 --> 23:29.103
Paul thinks that
you and Vaughn Davis

23:29.103 --> 23:30.452
were tight once upon a time.

23:30.452 --> 23:32.062
What, me and Vaughn?

23:32.062 --> 23:33.586
I never heard that name
till today

23:33.586 --> 23:35.457
when the department put out
the heads-up.

23:35.457 --> 23:37.285
And I don't know who
this Fink guy is, either.

23:37.285 --> 23:38.982
Well, he knows you.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.463
Well, how many dirtbags
know the name of cops, huh?

23:43.204 --> 23:44.684
I mean, it comes
with the territory.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.207
Are you really trying
to come at me

23:46.207 --> 23:48.731
with your reputation right now?

23:48.731 --> 23:50.080
Let me ask you then.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.821
Who'd you piss off
to ride the desk right now?

23:53.823 --> 23:55.216
Why don't you ask
the woke watchdog committee

23:55.216 --> 23:56.565
that dimed me out?

23:56.565 --> 23:59.307
And for what, doing my job.

23:59.307 --> 24:01.091
I got a hearing coming up.

24:01.091 --> 24:02.266
It won't last.

24:03.920 --> 24:04.834
Are we done here?

24:11.232 --> 24:12.668
You think he's lying
about Vaughn?

24:14.670 --> 24:16.367
I think he's lying
about Vaughn.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.633
You gonna say something?

24:20.633 --> 24:22.199
Nothing to say.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.506
Nobody wants to hear me talking
about dirty cops anymore.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.986
I'll tell you what.

24:25.986 --> 24:27.814
You got a hunch.

24:27.814 --> 24:31.513
Tell me what it is,
I promise you we'll follow it.

24:31.513 --> 24:33.994
- I told you what I think.
- Tell me again.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.735
Reynolds is lying.

24:35.735 --> 24:36.910
So what do you want
to do about it?

24:38.215 --> 24:39.390
Whatever it takes.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.184
Ayanna Bell.

24:50.184 --> 24:53.013
Nate Reynolds,
narcotics detective.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.711
He's on modified duty riding
a desk out of Brooklyn South.

24:55.711 --> 24:56.712
Mean anything?

24:56.712 --> 24:57.974
No, who is he?

24:57.974 --> 24:59.367
<i>That's what we're trying
to find out.</i>

24:59.367 --> 25:00.673
He's got a connection
to a known associate

25:00.673 --> 25:03.240
of Vaughn Davis,
and when we asked Reynolds

25:03.240 --> 25:04.677
about it, he lied to us.

25:04.677 --> 25:06.853
- So what do you want to do?
<i>- Well, everything.</i>

25:06.853 --> 25:09.551
Pull his file, put a tail on
him, check his phone records.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.031
Let me check with IAB first,

25:11.031 --> 25:12.728
make sure he's not
on their radar already.

25:14.295 --> 25:15.992
- And if he isn't?
<i>- Uh, sit tight.</i>

25:15.992 --> 25:17.603
<i>I'ma call you back
in five minutes.</i>

25:22.433 --> 25:23.739
What'd she say?

25:25.741 --> 25:26.742
Sit tight.

25:28.265 --> 25:29.658
You have your extra manpower.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.442
Thank you.

25:31.442 --> 25:33.662
You riding with me?

25:33.662 --> 25:35.316
- What?
- Our lunch, remember?

25:35.316 --> 25:38.319
I can't do
this lunch right now.

25:38.319 --> 25:40.060
Jet.

25:40.060 --> 25:42.453
I just got you extra help.
It's one hour. That's all.

25:42.453 --> 25:44.455
Lillian, I can't.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.240
Canceling last minute
on top brass

25:46.240 --> 25:48.808
is not a good look, Ayanna.

25:48.808 --> 25:51.071
You know what else
isn't a good look?

25:51.071 --> 25:52.942
Letting a cop killer get away.

25:56.903 --> 25:59.079
Okay, so we got the bodies
that we need

25:59.079 --> 26:00.471
to hunt down Vaughn's crew.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.561
I'm putting you at point.
- On it.

26:02.561 --> 26:04.780
All right--oh, also,
have you heard from Reyes?

26:06.956 --> 26:08.567
Where the hell is he?

26:34.157 --> 26:35.115
Yeah.

26:35.115 --> 26:36.246
Where are you?

26:36.246 --> 26:38.074
<i>Driving.</i>

26:38.074 --> 26:39.336
Bell is freaking out.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.295
<i>When do you get back here?</i>

26:41.295 --> 26:42.296
I'm on my way.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.558
Hurry up.

27:28.821 --> 27:30.518
What are we doing?

27:30.518 --> 27:32.738
Going for a little ride.

27:47.404 --> 27:50.538
I doubt that's what Bell
meant by sitting tight.

27:50.538 --> 27:51.495
Is there a problem?

27:54.411 --> 27:56.239
Relax, this is on me.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.561
Get out your phone
and record this.

28:34.974 --> 28:37.411
Patience. Patience.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.586
We got him.

28:38.586 --> 28:40.588
He's dropping the gear off
for Vaughn.

28:40.588 --> 28:41.720
Right, and?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.896
And he's gonna
lead us to Vaughn.

28:43.896 --> 28:47.073
Or that gear will
bring Vaughn to us.

28:47.073 --> 28:48.639
I mean, Vaughn is not
coming until Reynolds

28:48.639 --> 28:49.728
gives him the okay, right?

28:57.257 --> 28:58.606
Make a call.

28:58.606 --> 29:00.564
Have someone follow Reynolds
while we wait.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.262
But we're not even
supposed to be here.

29:02.262 --> 29:05.352
Better to ask for forgiveness
than permission.

29:11.532 --> 29:12.533
Who is it?

29:14.796 --> 29:15.797
What?

29:18.757 --> 29:20.454
I don't speak--

29:20.454 --> 29:21.585
How you doing, Leonard?

29:21.585 --> 29:23.239
What--what--what is this?

29:25.459 --> 29:26.460
You know who I am?

29:26.460 --> 29:28.810
A cop, I'm hoping?

29:28.810 --> 29:30.246
I don't look familiar?

29:32.901 --> 29:33.989
Ray?

29:33.989 --> 29:35.643
Oh, my God.

29:35.643 --> 29:37.210
Ray.

29:37.210 --> 29:38.472
It's so good to see you again.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.300
What are you doing here?
What is this?

29:40.300 --> 29:41.910
That was me
at the house earlier.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.782
That was you?

29:43.782 --> 29:45.827
Why'd you run?

29:50.614 --> 29:54.183
I don't know what those boys
told you, but they're lying.

29:54.183 --> 29:56.795
They are troubled kids,
all of them.

29:56.795 --> 29:58.144
You know,
that's funny because

29:58.144 --> 30:00.624
that's what you
used to tell us.

30:00.624 --> 30:01.843
You know?

30:01.843 --> 30:04.106
It was all a plan
just to keep us weak

30:04.106 --> 30:05.673
so we wouldn't fight back.

30:05.673 --> 30:07.893
You mean the roughhousing?

30:07.893 --> 30:09.372
Oh, come on.

30:09.372 --> 30:10.373
You were boys.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.680
You needed to get
that energy out.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.160
Are you still upset about that?

30:14.160 --> 30:15.639
That's not what
I'm talking about!

30:19.643 --> 30:21.863
Does it look like that's
what I'm talking about?

30:23.256 --> 30:27.173
I'm not talking about that
or the burns or the alcohol.

30:30.393 --> 30:33.875
I'm talking about what you did
to us behind closed doors.

30:33.875 --> 30:35.877
Don't you--

30:35.877 --> 30:38.706
please, just don't deny it.

30:38.706 --> 30:39.925
Are you sure?

30:41.317 --> 30:45.756
I mean, that's just what
Vaughn, Dante, Manny,

30:45.756 --> 30:47.323
that's what they told you.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.891
I mean, you didn't see it.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.501
Do you know it's true?

30:53.503 --> 30:56.898
Because I never did anything
to you, did I?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.949
Why not?

31:03.949 --> 31:05.994
Why not what?

31:09.389 --> 31:11.652
Why didn't you do
anything to me?

31:16.265 --> 31:19.268
Was there something wrong
with me?

31:19.268 --> 31:21.836
Ray.

31:21.836 --> 31:24.752
No, you were perfect.

31:24.752 --> 31:27.015
It's perfect little angel.

31:27.015 --> 31:30.714
I would never want to hurt you.

31:30.714 --> 31:34.283
Boys come to me broken.

31:34.283 --> 31:38.635
I just try my best
to provide comfort, a home.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.463
You destroyed them.

31:42.291 --> 31:43.989
You keep destroying them.

31:45.555 --> 31:47.862
It has to stop.

31:47.862 --> 31:50.082
Ray...

31:50.082 --> 31:53.476
it's just gonna be my word
against theirs.

31:53.476 --> 31:58.960
A caring man who gives up
his home and time and money

31:58.960 --> 32:02.659
to raise children no one wants.

32:06.707 --> 32:09.101
Is anyone besides you
gonna really believe

32:09.101 --> 32:11.320
I'm guilty of anything?

32:15.063 --> 32:16.282
You're right.

32:18.501 --> 32:21.940
They probably won't believe me
or those boys.

32:32.037 --> 32:34.474
Paul.

32:34.474 --> 32:37.825
You're going to work with me.

32:37.825 --> 32:41.611
I see you and Vaughn are tight,
much more than you let on.

32:41.611 --> 32:42.743
So we'll start there.

32:42.743 --> 32:44.571
Now, according
to Detective Stabler,

32:44.571 --> 32:47.052
you assaulted him
with a deadly weapon.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.314
He said that?

32:48.314 --> 32:51.143
Attempted murder of a cop.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.232
Now, that's some serious time.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.668
Tell me what you know
about Vaughn Davis

32:54.668 --> 32:58.280
and where he is,
and I may be able to help you.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.021
I already gave you Reynolds.

33:00.021 --> 33:01.980
And I'm so appreciative
of that.

33:01.980 --> 33:05.331
But this is extra credit,
so think harder.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.246
Or I'm gonna find a
special seat for you

33:07.246 --> 33:09.204
on the bus to Rikers.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.207
It's your choice.

33:12.207 --> 33:15.210
Vaughn has this place
he goes to.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.388
An old rundown apartment.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.956
He meets someone there
from time to time.

33:21.956 --> 33:24.089
- Who?
- Some creepy old dude.

33:24.089 --> 33:27.135
I don't know, I guess he's
known him since he was a kid.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.398
Always weirded me out.

33:29.398 --> 33:33.098
I think they got some funny
stuff going on between them.

33:33.098 --> 33:36.057
What funny stuff?

33:36.057 --> 33:40.105
You know, like that stuff.

33:41.932 --> 33:44.500
Where is this apartment?

33:47.938 --> 33:49.549
Bingo.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.638
Is that Vaughn? I can't tell.

33:51.638 --> 33:52.943
Let's find out.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.344
Police!

34:02.344 --> 34:04.651
Open the door slowly.
Show me your hands.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.263
Show me your hands!

34:08.263 --> 34:11.136
Slowly! Hands! Hands!

34:11.136 --> 34:12.746
One foot at a time.

34:12.746 --> 34:13.660
Get out of the car.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.185
Get out of the car.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.230
What did I do?

34:18.230 --> 34:19.231
Get out.

34:19.231 --> 34:20.710
Don't move.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.277
Am I under arrest?

34:24.192 --> 34:25.150
Who are you?

34:25.150 --> 34:26.238
I'm Harrison.

34:26.238 --> 34:27.717
What are you doing here?

34:27.717 --> 34:29.415
Some guy just paid me
300 bucks to just park here.

34:29.415 --> 34:30.677
I didn't do anything wrong,
did I?

34:30.677 --> 34:32.374
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Who?

34:32.374 --> 34:33.375
What did he look like?

34:33.375 --> 34:35.290
Uh, about my size.

34:36.378 --> 34:38.598
He walked into the arcade.

34:38.598 --> 34:41.514
Asked me if I wanted
to make 300 bucks.

34:50.218 --> 34:51.828
I think we found Vaughn.

34:58.531 --> 35:00.141
On the count of three,
you ready?

35:00.141 --> 35:02.578
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

35:10.586 --> 35:13.111
10-85, shots fired
at 10th and Prospect,

35:13.111 --> 35:15.200
require immediate backup.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.375
Active shooter.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.551
Split up?

35:18.551 --> 35:19.943
Cover me.

35:22.207 --> 35:24.122
You set?
- Yeah.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.166
Go.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.356
You hit?

35:41.356 --> 35:43.271
I'm good. I'm good.

35:43.271 --> 35:44.490
You see him?

35:48.581 --> 35:49.625
Hey.

36:16.478 --> 36:19.133
Reynolds, I need help.

36:20.090 --> 36:22.310
Well, you better get here
because if they get me,

36:22.310 --> 36:23.442
I'm giving you up.

36:53.994 --> 36:54.951
Reyes.

36:56.779 --> 36:58.259
It's Bell. Are you here?

37:04.091 --> 37:06.180
I'm sorry.
I went off grid.

37:08.530 --> 37:10.837
I had to find him.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.448
He couldn't hurt any more boys
like that.

37:13.448 --> 37:16.277
I'm gonna make sure
he doesn't hurt anyone else.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.888
Go ahead and tell her
what you told me.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.283
About Vaughn.

37:30.073 --> 37:34.643
Vaughn still comes here,
so they could be alone.

37:34.643 --> 37:38.212
Do you know where
Vaughn is now?

37:38.212 --> 37:40.910
The last time we spoke,

37:40.910 --> 37:43.739
he told me he was gonna go out
in a blaze of glory.

38:05.500 --> 38:06.719
What took so long?

38:06.719 --> 38:07.894
- On the ground!
- Get on the ground!

38:07.894 --> 38:08.982
- Ground!
- On the ground!

38:08.982 --> 38:10.940
- Ground!
- On the ground now!

38:12.855 --> 38:14.379
Don't move, don't move!

38:16.729 --> 38:19.253
- Got him?
- Got him.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.385
Clear.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.212
Oh, look at this.

38:22.212 --> 38:24.824
Of course this dirtbag
has one of our vests.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.565
A good cop always
wears the vest, right?

38:26.565 --> 38:27.740
What would you
know about that?

38:27.740 --> 38:29.785
You're no cop.
You washed out, right?

38:29.785 --> 38:31.613
- I would have made a good cop.
- Uh-huh.

38:31.613 --> 38:33.572
- Just like you.
- Yeah.

38:33.572 --> 38:34.877
Did Reynolds rat me out?

38:34.877 --> 38:36.226
He didn't have to.

38:36.226 --> 38:37.750
Yeah, no,
when we picked up Reynolds,

38:37.750 --> 38:39.621
we also picked up his phone.

38:43.016 --> 38:45.323
- Do me a favor, all right?
- No.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.977
Tell Ray he was
the lucky one, okay?

38:49.283 --> 38:51.329
He was the lucky one.

38:55.115 --> 38:56.899
Bobby.

38:56.899 --> 38:58.118
Hey, your sergeant called me.

38:58.118 --> 39:00.207
She was worried about you.
Are you okay?

39:00.207 --> 39:01.817
Yeah.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.297
How'd you know I was
coming to the hospital?

39:03.297 --> 39:04.777
Well, she told me
about Leonard.

39:04.777 --> 39:05.995
And you weren't
answering your phone.

39:05.995 --> 39:08.694
And I knew you would
want to tell Dante.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.305
Hey, I know what this
all means to you.

39:11.305 --> 39:13.394
Yeah, but I got to tell him.
I got to be the one to do it.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.876
I mean, Leonard will
never hurt another boy

39:16.876 --> 39:18.834
like he did ever again.

39:21.576 --> 39:22.795
You want to wait out here, or--

39:22.795 --> 39:24.405
Bobby, Dante's not in there.

39:24.405 --> 39:25.754
What, they put him in ICU?

39:25.754 --> 39:27.365
I mean, where is he?
That's great.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.368
No, I guess Dante got
a blood clot during surgery,

39:30.368 --> 39:32.152
and they didn't
see it right away.

39:32.152 --> 39:35.242
And it traveled to his head, and...

39:36.939 --> 39:38.593
He didn't make it.

39:42.423 --> 39:44.382
What?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.731
He's dead, Bobby.

40:00.049 --> 40:02.269
I didn't get to tell him.

40:02.269 --> 40:05.577
It's okay. He knows.

40:05.577 --> 40:06.621
I didn't get to tell him.

40:13.236 --> 40:14.847
Hey, I was just
about to leave.

40:14.847 --> 40:16.283
You get my text?

40:16.283 --> 40:18.503
They processed Vaughn,
and they found the van.

40:18.503 --> 40:20.200
Good work today.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.158
You know who was good?
Whelan.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.422
Couldn't have done it
without him.

40:24.422 --> 40:25.727
So what are we drinking?

40:31.820 --> 40:34.301
For emergencies.

40:34.301 --> 40:35.998
Not even opened.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.131
I just don't feel much like
going to a bar tonight.

40:45.747 --> 40:46.705
To good cops.

40:46.705 --> 40:48.707
The best.

40:55.931 --> 40:57.629
Detective Stabler.

40:57.629 --> 40:59.718
Detective,
sorry for the late call,

40:59.718 --> 41:03.112
but I didn't know
where else to turn.

41:03.112 --> 41:06.376
I have some very important
information to share.
