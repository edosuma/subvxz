18:14.852 --> 18:16.129
And I don't need you constantly
reminding me

18:16.267 --> 18:17.820
of my disability, OK?

18:17.958 --> 18:19.615
Trust me, I'm aware.

18:21.134 --> 18:23.205
This is my decision,

18:23.343 --> 18:25.414
and I'm getting the surgery.

18:26.553 --> 18:27.623
- Yeah.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.628
- Can you print the coral now?

18:37.944 --> 18:40.084
- These are the saddest
balloons I've ever seen.

18:40.222 --> 18:41.741
We're throwing a bar mitzvah.

18:41.879 --> 18:43.605
It's supposed to be
a celebration.

18:43.743 --> 18:45.745
They should look like they're
about to pop, not drown.

18:47.367 --> 18:48.782
It's going great, Chief.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.232
You're the best.

18:54.616 --> 18:56.411
Oh, Yasuda, help these two.

18:56.549 --> 18:58.723
I've got to figure out if
there's a semi-decent DJ

18:58.861 --> 19:00.035
in this hospital.

19:01.070 --> 19:03.176
- Are we supposed to be
surgeons or camp counselors?

19:03.314 --> 19:06.800
- Ah, says the one-man
Babysitters Club.

19:06.938 --> 19:08.319
Where are you going?

19:08.457 --> 19:09.941
- A woman came in paralyzed,
and Dr. Shepherd

19:10.079 --> 19:11.184
is 3D printing a vertebrae

19:11.322 --> 19:12.772
so we can do an awesome
spinal fusion,

19:12.910 --> 19:14.774
while saving her life
all on the same day.

19:14.912 --> 19:15.982
I'm taking a power nap.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.535
- What about the surgery?

19:17.673 --> 19:18.985
- Dr. Shepherd
is still printing,

19:19.123 --> 19:21.332
and I just need 20 minutes
to complete one REM cycle

19:21.470 --> 19:22.575
while the caffeine kicks in.

19:24.128 --> 19:25.681
- On Call room
is the other way.

19:28.512 --> 19:31.342
- What if she has CMV
or encephalitis?

19:32.964 --> 19:37.728
- Well, she hasn't been
vomiting or had a fever.

19:37.866 --> 19:40.524
- But it could be a tumor,
like an acoustic neuroma.

19:40.662 --> 19:42.836
- Then we'll be grateful that
it's benign and resectable.

19:42.974 --> 19:44.424
- Yeah, but it could be
cancerous, right?

19:44.562 --> 19:46.737
Like--like nasopharyngeal
or something.

19:46.875 --> 19:49.222
There are leukemia patients
that sometimes--

19:49.360 --> 19:51.431
- Jo.

19:51.569 --> 19:53.261
I know this is
a little like saying

19:53.399 --> 19:56.333
stop needing oxygen to live,

19:56.471 --> 19:58.611
but let's not panic.

19:58.749 --> 20:00.854
We need to take it
one step at a time.

20:00.992 --> 20:02.166
- Wilson, Luna.

20:02.304 --> 20:03.823
- Yes. Yeah, that's us.

20:03.961 --> 20:07.482
Hey. Come here.
Come here. Ohh.

20:10.519 --> 20:12.245
Will you come with us?

20:14.385 --> 20:17.388
- Yeah, of course.
- OK.

20:17.526 --> 20:19.597
Come on.
Come on.

20:24.568 --> 20:26.708
- Do you visualize the needle?

20:26.846 --> 20:27.916
- Yes.

20:28.054 --> 20:29.228
- Good.

20:29.366 --> 20:30.746
Now, study the ultrasound,
as you guide

20:30.884 --> 20:32.783
the tip of the needle
toward the center

20:32.921 --> 20:35.268
of the hypoechoic mass.

20:36.407 --> 20:37.684
- It's bad, isn't it?

20:37.822 --> 20:39.617
You found something bad,
didn't you?

20:39.755 --> 20:42.033
- On appearance,
it looks suspicious,

20:42.171 --> 20:44.070
but we won't know anything for
sure until we get the results

20:44.208 --> 20:45.416
of the biopsy back.

20:45.554 --> 20:49.386
- I just got on this
huge case at my firm.

20:49.524 --> 20:50.421
They might be arguing
in front of

20:50.559 --> 20:51.802
the Washington Supreme Court.

20:51.940 --> 20:53.562
This was not in my plans.

20:53.700 --> 20:55.978
I mean, I thought this was
some weird, little infection,

20:56.116 --> 20:57.946
and I would go home
with an antibiotic.

20:58.084 --> 21:00.673
Can I try an antibiotic
to see if it goes away?

21:00.811 --> 21:03.192
- An antibiotic, unfortunately,
won't work for this.

21:03.331 --> 21:05.125
- How is this happening?

21:05.264 --> 21:07.266
I go to the doctor regularly.

21:07.404 --> 21:08.991
I mean, sometimes
I miss it for work,

21:09.129 --> 21:10.234
but I always reschedule,

21:10.372 --> 21:12.098
and I do the self-exams
in the shower.

21:12.236 --> 21:14.238
It's just all feels lumpy.

21:14.376 --> 21:15.757
How was I supposed to know?

21:15.895 --> 21:17.862
- Tobey, you have
dense breast tissue.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.485
You did everything right.

21:19.623 --> 21:21.210
What Dr. Griffith
found was small,

21:21.349 --> 21:23.799
so it might have been difficult
to feel during your last exam

21:23.937 --> 21:26.457
- I feel like
I'm being punished

21:26.595 --> 21:29.460
for working so hard,

21:29.598 --> 21:31.911
for always putting it first.

21:32.049 --> 21:34.810
My mom is gonna say
I should've had kids earlier,

21:34.948 --> 21:39.436
that a career is not gonna
make me smile in 20 years.

21:39.574 --> 21:43.716
- Yes, it will,
if it's the right one.

21:43.854 --> 21:45.096
I don't mean to contradict
your mother.

21:45.234 --> 21:46.477
- Please contradict my mother.

21:47.892 --> 21:50.930
- You loving your job,
that is a beautiful thing.

21:51.068 --> 21:53.588
Don't ever let anyone
make you wrong for that.

21:53.726 --> 21:57.108
It does not make you cold,
it makes you passionate.

21:57.246 --> 21:59.904
And you are not being punished.

22:00.042 --> 22:01.803
Even if this turns
out to be malignant,

22:01.941 --> 22:03.494
you have options.

22:03.632 --> 22:05.496
You have good options.

22:05.634 --> 22:07.326
You are so on top of
everything that you came here

22:07.464 --> 22:09.500
immediately, and that means
there's a chance that we might

22:09.638 --> 22:12.054
have found something early.

22:12.192 --> 22:14.263
Not everyone has that chance.

22:14.402 --> 22:16.162
You're gonna be OK, Tobey.

22:16.921 --> 22:18.889
- We'll be back with
the biopsy results shortly.

22:19.027 --> 22:20.649
Try to relax until then.

22:20.787 --> 22:21.685
- OK.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.137
- Just get those to pathology.
- Yeah.

22:29.037 --> 22:31.108
If it does turn
out to be cancer,

22:31.246 --> 22:33.490
I can't be the one to tell her.

22:33.628 --> 22:35.906
- Yes, you can.

22:36.044 --> 22:37.494
Good doctors connect
with their patients

22:37.632 --> 22:39.150
for all kinds of reasons,

22:39.288 --> 22:41.014
and you see yourself in Tobey,

22:41.152 --> 22:42.947
so she'll trust you.

22:45.225 --> 22:46.848
My mother died of it--

22:46.986 --> 22:51.197
breast cancer,
and we did not catch it early.

22:51.335 --> 22:53.820
And it was long and painful,

22:53.958 --> 22:55.753
and it took her away from me.

22:55.891 --> 22:58.894
It took her away from
a life that she loved

22:59.032 --> 23:00.931
and that she had waited
too long to claim.

23:03.658 --> 23:05.211
I'm just really
missing her right now.

23:05.349 --> 23:07.282
I hope I'm doing her proud.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.732
- There's no way you're not.

23:08.870 --> 23:12.701
You are one of the best
teachers I've ever had.

23:12.839 --> 23:14.669
I hope I get to
learn from you again.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.363
- [sighs]
- You know,

23:19.501 --> 23:21.089
a watched 3D printer
never boils.

23:21.227 --> 23:23.505
- Our patient was lucky
that you happen to be in town

23:23.643 --> 23:25.231
when she took a fall.
- She is, isn't she?

23:25.369 --> 23:27.751
- Well, I think our patient
was lucky to have had

23:27.889 --> 23:29.753
a loved one nearby to help.

23:29.891 --> 23:31.858
- I think our patient is just
trying to live their life,

23:31.996 --> 23:33.722
but they can't because
their loved one

23:33.860 --> 23:35.103
is obsessed with being needed.

23:35.241 --> 23:37.588
- So you're saying
our patient is being

23:37.726 --> 23:38.934
oppressed by being loved?

23:39.072 --> 23:41.316
- Should we go over
the surgical plan?

23:41.454 --> 23:42.869
- Uh--fine.
- Yes.

23:43.870 --> 23:44.561
- OK.

23:44.699 --> 23:46.804
- A little higher.

23:46.942 --> 23:49.842
Good.
No, no, lower.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.430
Perfect.

23:51.568 --> 23:53.259
How's that' looking, Pru?

23:53.397 --> 23:55.019
Pru?

23:55.157 --> 23:58.195
Ah, damn it. Pru?

23:58.333 --> 24:00.335
Has anybody seen the kid?
Pru?

24:00.473 --> 24:03.407
- Well, I guess the gift shop
doesn't have a Judaica section.

24:03.545 --> 24:04.995
- Pru?

24:06.962 --> 24:08.516
- That's not better, is it?

24:09.724 --> 24:10.932
- Where's Yasuda?

24:11.070 --> 24:12.347
She's supposed to be
scrubbing in.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.107
- Oh, I'm not sure,

24:14.245 --> 24:17.421
but if you need an intern,
I'm available.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.009
- Let's go.

24:21.977 --> 24:23.496
- Thank you.

24:30.710 --> 24:32.263
- She's OK.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.717
- She's gotta stop
doing this to me.

24:37.855 --> 24:40.168
- Nola is being moved
back to the ICU.

24:40.306 --> 24:41.790
You can go and sit with her.

24:41.928 --> 24:43.585
- OK.

24:43.723 --> 24:47.175
Thank you for saving her twice.

24:47.313 --> 24:49.246
Thank you.

24:52.145 --> 24:55.701
- I'm glad you're
staying at Grey Sloan.

24:55.839 --> 24:58.324
I'm glad you're not
going to Chicago.

24:58.462 --> 24:59.774
I want to be on your service.

24:59.912 --> 25:02.466
Today was amazing.
Your technique is amazing.

25:02.604 --> 25:03.985
I want to learn from you.

25:04.123 --> 25:06.712
I need to learn from you.
So--

25:09.369 --> 25:11.993
- I'm not being
disloyal to Grey Sloan,

25:12.131 --> 25:14.616
and I'm not going to
apologize for being ambitious.

25:14.754 --> 25:17.516
- Did my husband call you
too ambitious?

25:17.654 --> 25:21.243
- Not exactly, but it felt like
it and not in the good way.

25:21.381 --> 25:24.523
- That man. He's been around
ambitious women his whole life.

25:24.661 --> 25:26.076
He wouldn't have
it any other way.

25:26.214 --> 25:27.905
- You are a trailblazer.

25:28.043 --> 25:31.702
- I am.
So was Ellis Grey.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.290
- Yeah, right.

25:33.428 --> 25:36.051
You--you knew her, too.

25:36.189 --> 25:37.501
- Not really.

25:37.639 --> 25:40.815
Our paths would cross at
a conference here or there.

25:40.953 --> 25:43.093
There weren't as many
female surgeons back then,

25:43.231 --> 25:44.957
and a group of us would
arrange our flights

25:45.095 --> 25:46.475
so we could have
a drink together

25:46.614 --> 25:48.754
that last day, but not Ellis.

25:48.892 --> 25:51.411
She was always jetting off
to her next big surgery

25:51.550 --> 25:53.448
or research.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.761
She wasn't going to let a
little thing like friendship

25:55.899 --> 25:58.349
or camaraderie get in the way.

25:58.487 --> 26:00.386
- Coldness is in my genes.

26:00.524 --> 26:03.665
- Not coldness. Focus.

26:03.803 --> 26:07.117
Ellis Grey saved
a lot of lives.

26:09.498 --> 26:15.125
Maggie, you are so much more
than Ellis' pure ambition.

26:15.263 --> 26:21.269
You are kindness,
caring, honor,

26:21.407 --> 26:25.584
fairness, friendship, love.

26:26.861 --> 26:29.760
I happen to believe that
you carry those traits

26:29.898 --> 26:31.866
in your genes as well.

26:32.004 --> 26:34.662
- Richard.
- Oh, that man loves you

26:34.800 --> 26:37.112
like you're the best part
of him and Ellis.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.770
In all due respect
to your parents,

26:39.908 --> 26:42.601
I don't think a day goes
by when he doesn't wish

26:42.739 --> 26:46.294
that he and Ellis
were both brave enough

26:46.432 --> 26:48.468
to follow their hearts.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.298
If only so, he would
have been a part

26:50.436 --> 26:51.989
of your life so much sooner

26:52.127 --> 26:54.026
- I do wish I had
known him longer.

26:54.164 --> 26:56.545
- Child, you are moving,
you're not dying.

26:56.684 --> 26:59.997
We're going to still see you.
[laughs]

27:06.210 --> 27:08.281
- I had the terrible broth,
and I'm fine,

27:08.419 --> 27:10.663
Can I please have
something real to eat?

27:10.801 --> 27:13.597
- I think you might want
to wait on the solids.

27:13.735 --> 27:15.323
I got something better for you.

27:15.461 --> 27:17.049
- Why are you holding
my nice shoes?

27:17.187 --> 27:18.844
- I talked to your parents,
and they agreed

27:18.982 --> 27:20.915
that since everybody
is here together,

27:21.053 --> 27:22.986
there's no point in
postponing your bar mitzvah.

27:23.124 --> 27:26.645
So we're throwing it for you
today here at Grey Sloan.

27:26.783 --> 27:28.060
- No.
- What do you mean?

27:28.198 --> 27:29.371
- Are you crazy?

27:29.509 --> 27:30.441
I'm not having my bar
mitzvah at a hospital

27:30.579 --> 27:31.960
like some bubble boy loser.

27:32.098 --> 27:34.273
- That's not what I--
- I said no!

27:34.411 --> 27:36.240
No bar mitzvah.

27:36.378 --> 27:37.759
- [sighs]

27:44.248 --> 27:46.043
[alarm blaring]

27:46.181 --> 27:48.149
- No.
No, no, no, no.

27:48.287 --> 27:50.082
No. No!

27:54.845 --> 27:56.157
- Suction.

27:56.295 --> 27:58.573
- Are you ready for fusion?
- Why wouldn't I be?

27:58.711 --> 28:00.920
- You're angry, and I just
want to make sure that whatever

28:01.058 --> 28:02.163
it is you're angry about,

28:02.301 --> 28:03.612
it's not going to affect
our patient.

28:03.751 --> 28:06.650
- Do I seem angry, Kwan?

28:06.788 --> 28:08.756
- Is this a trick question?

28:08.894 --> 28:11.137
- Kai is taking a job
and moving to London

28:11.275 --> 28:12.760
to start a new research team.

28:12.898 --> 28:16.729
So we either have to do oceanic
long distance, or break up.

28:16.867 --> 28:18.351
- Well, for what
it's worth, I heard

28:18.489 --> 28:20.457
they've added a bunch of direct
flights from Europe to Sea-Tac.

28:20.595 --> 28:23.632
