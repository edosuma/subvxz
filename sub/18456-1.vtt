01:10.738 --> 01:14.575
<i>I don't see any reason
to be tasteful about Auschwitz.</i>

01:15.493 --> 01:17.411
<i>I say to you quite tastelessly</i>

01:17.495 --> 01:19.288
<i>that more women died
on the back seat</i>

01:19.371 --> 01:21.665
<i>of Senator Edward Kennedy's
car at Chappaquiddick</i>

01:21.749 --> 01:24.418
<i>than ever died in
a gas chamber at Auschwitz.</i>

01:31.592 --> 01:34.011
<i>Holocaust denial rests on</i>

01:34.136 --> 01:36.388
four basic assertions.

01:36.514 --> 01:37.681
Number one.

01:39.975 --> 01:43.813
That there was never any systematic
or organized attempt by the Nazis

01:43.896 --> 01:45.898
to kill all of Europe's Jews.

01:46.816 --> 01:47.858
Number two.

01:48.859 --> 01:52.905
That the numbers are far fewer
than five or six million.

01:53.781 --> 01:54.990
Number three.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.202
That there were
no gas chambers

01:58.285 --> 02:01.372
or specially built
extermination facilities.

02:01.872 --> 02:02.957
Number four.

02:03.040 --> 02:05.793
That the Holocaust
is therefore a myth

02:05.876 --> 02:08.044
invented by Jews

02:08.128 --> 02:10.047
to get themselves
financial compensation

02:10.131 --> 02:12.883
and to further the fortunes
of the State of Israel.

02:13.551 --> 02:18.055
War, the deniers say,
is a bloody business.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.516
There's nothing special
about the Jews,

02:20.599 --> 02:22.852
they're not unique
in their suffering.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.895
They're just everyday
casualties of war.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.397
What's the fuss?

02:28.440 --> 02:30.734
Okay, and here's
another question,

02:31.193 --> 02:34.071
how do we know
the Holocaust happened?

02:36.031 --> 02:38.576
Seriously. I'm asking.
How do we prove it?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.369
Photographic evidence?

02:40.452 --> 02:42.454
Not one person in
this room or outside it

02:42.538 --> 02:45.332
has ever seen a photograph
of a Jew inside a gas chamber.

02:45.416 --> 02:46.584
You know why?

02:46.917 --> 02:49.378
Because the Germans made sure
that none were ever taken.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.590
So how do we know?

02:53.924 --> 02:58.470
How do we know
that so many were murdered?

02:59.263 --> 03:02.433
So what's the proof?
Where's the proof?

03:02.975 --> 03:04.685
How strong is it?

03:33.214 --> 03:35.216
<i>Good morning on Veterans Day,</i>

03:35.299 --> 03:37.051
<i>ceremonies being held today</i>

03:37.134 --> 03:38.719
<i>here in Washington
and across the country.</i>

03:38.802 --> 03:40.387
Here, Mutt.
<i>I'm Bob Edwards.</i>

03:40.471 --> 03:42.556
<i>Today is Friday,
November 11th,</i>

03:42.640 --> 03:45.184
<i>and this is NPR's</i>
Morning Edition.

04:13.963 --> 04:15.714
<i>Morning, Professor Lipstadt.
Good morning.</i>

04:15.839 --> 04:17.800
Good morning, Professor.
Morning.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.344
Morning.
Morning.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.389
Speech. Two copies
with corrections.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.057
And Jamie called from NBC.

04:25.140 --> 04:27.226
They still want the
interview about the book.

04:27.309 --> 04:30.020
These go back to the library.
You make copies.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.855
All right.
I'll take this.

04:34.525 --> 04:35.651
And he needs water.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.361
You want a hand with that?
I'm okay.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.533
<i>And Atlanta weather
on this Veterans Day,</i>

04:42.616 --> 04:44.576
<i>mostly sunny
with clouds creeping in</i>

04:44.660 --> 04:46.412
<i>by the end of the afternoon.</i>

04:46.537 --> 04:47.788
I do a lot
of these events.

04:47.871 --> 04:49.540
So if you could put
a table at the back.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.084
Right by the door, uh,
perfect as they leave.

04:52.167 --> 04:53.711
Oh, I certainly will.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.221
<i>Any writer will tell you,
at these events</i>

05:04.305 --> 05:06.348
you always sell 37 books.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.018
No matter what size,
uh, the audience.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.811
If it's 50 people, 37 books

05:10.894 --> 05:13.856
and I'm wondering, you know, is it fixed?
Do you think it's fixed?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.316
Thank you
so much, Deborah.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.484
But I think we better
get things started, yeah?

05:19.028 --> 05:21.322
Everyone, it is
my pleasure to introduce

05:21.405 --> 05:23.073
the holder of the Dorot Chair

05:23.157 --> 05:24.825
in Jewish and
Holocaust Studies

05:24.908 --> 05:26.452
at Emory University

05:26.535 --> 05:29.496
and the author of
<i>Denying the Holocaust:</i>

05:29.580 --> 05:32.624
<i>The Growing Assault
on Truth and Memory,</i>

05:32.708 --> 05:34.251
Deborah Lipstadt.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.010
Whatever the reasons
that people become deniers,

05:43.093 --> 05:44.595
when you look closely,

05:44.678 --> 05:47.348
they often have an agenda
which they won't admit to.

05:47.431 --> 05:50.017
So denial is a pick
to undo the lock

05:50.100 --> 05:51.935
to open the door
to something else.

05:52.144 --> 05:53.145
Yes.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.189
Somebody told me you
don't debate with people

05:55.272 --> 05:57.149
who say the Holocaust
didn't happen.

05:57.775 --> 05:58.776
Uh, that is correct.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.820
Like I don't debate with
people who say Elvis is alive.

06:02.946 --> 06:05.199
Talking to people
you don't agree with,

06:05.282 --> 06:07.368
that's democracy, isn't it?

06:07.701 --> 06:09.370
It's cowardly
not to talk to them.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.205
Are you calling me a coward?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.831
Well...
No, no, listen.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.792
I... I don't see it that way.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.127
You can have opinions
about the Holocaust.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.421
You can argue about
why it happened

06:19.505 --> 06:20.631
and how it happened.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.967
But what I won't do is meet
with anyone, anyone,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.011
who says it didn't happen.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.014
Because the Holocaust happened.
It happened.

06:29.306 --> 06:32.226
And that isn't opinion.
That's fact.

06:32.309 --> 06:33.977
And I won't debate fact.

06:34.603 --> 06:36.063
In your book,
why do you continually

06:36.146 --> 06:37.940
denigrate the work
of David Irving?

06:38.023 --> 06:39.900
He's a scholar.
He's discovered all sorts of

06:39.983 --> 06:41.944
primary sources
no one else knew about.

06:42.027 --> 06:43.278
Well, to be honest,

06:43.362 --> 06:46.407
I don't think
I do denigrate him.

06:46.490 --> 06:48.617
Actually, I don't really
think about him that much.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.536
I don't think
he's worth my time.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.832
Yes, sir.
Gentleman in the back.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.041
Professor Lipstadt.

06:56.875 --> 06:59.253
Uh, let me reveal
something to you, Professor.

07:00.337 --> 07:03.715
I am that David Irving about
whom you have been so rude.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.843
Yes, yes, I am he.

07:06.593 --> 07:08.137
And it puzzles me

07:08.220 --> 07:10.764
that you think yourself
qualified to attack me,

07:10.848 --> 07:14.268
given that I have 30 years'
experience in the archives

07:14.351 --> 07:15.686
and my books have
been published by

07:15.769 --> 07:18.272
some of the greatest publishing
houses in the world.

07:18.355 --> 07:21.108
Viking Press, William Morrow,
E.P. Dutton.

07:21.191 --> 07:22.693
I have to conclude

07:23.193 --> 07:24.778
that the reason
you don't engage

07:24.862 --> 07:26.196
with people you disagree with

07:26.280 --> 07:29.366
is because you can't and
you might learn some facts.

07:29.658 --> 07:31.118
Facts, Miss Lipstadt,

07:31.201 --> 07:32.953
which don't suit
your opinions.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.122
Well? Well?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.124
Mr. Irving,
I will not debate you.

07:37.207 --> 07:39.376
Not here. Not now. Not ever.

07:39.460 --> 07:41.253
So if you would please
just sit down

07:41.336 --> 07:42.796
and you can go and speak

07:42.880 --> 07:44.339
in another room
at another time.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.008
You want gullible students
to believe

07:46.091 --> 07:47.718
that there are mounds
of documents

07:47.801 --> 07:49.470
which prove a Holocaust.

07:49.553 --> 07:51.722
You even said that
Hitler ordered it.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.726
Well, I've got $1,000

07:55.809 --> 07:58.520
in my pocket.
Yes, $1,000,

07:58.604 --> 08:01.106
and I'm willing to
give that $1,000

08:01.190 --> 08:03.817
to anyone, anyone,
who can show me a document

08:03.901 --> 08:06.528
that proves that Hitler ordered
the killing of the Jews.

08:06.612 --> 08:09.448
Here it is.
This is not your Q&A.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.325
You can go and
speak somewhere else.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.869
Who pays for you
to write your books?

08:13.952 --> 08:15.537
I need someone from security.

08:15.621 --> 08:17.498
Who is it that finances
all your expensive trips...

08:17.581 --> 08:20.959
Sit down. Mr. Irving!
Sit down or leave.

08:21.793 --> 08:22.878
Can you deal
with this guy?

08:23.837 --> 08:24.838
Okay, step in.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.883
Ah, Miss Lipstadt
not only won't debate.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.676
She calls security
to stop me from debating.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.762
No, leave it. Leave it.
I'm gonna need you to sit down.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.304
So be it.
If anybody wants,

08:33.388 --> 08:35.224
I shall be signing my books
after the event.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.933
My books, they're free.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.018
Come and get one.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.023
Thank you.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.275
$1,000! $1,000!

08:48.445 --> 08:50.113
An example
of real history.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.782
I hope you find it edifying.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.700
Real history opposed to

08:53.784 --> 08:56.537
manufactured history
and sentimentalized.

09:04.253 --> 09:05.462
Ah.

09:05.963 --> 09:08.549
<i>Today I've heard you
telling lies to students.</i>

09:08.632 --> 09:10.050
<i>...speak in another room
at another time.</i>

09:10.133 --> 09:12.052
<i>You want gullible
students to believe...</i>

09:12.135 --> 09:13.303
Perfect.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.024
<i>Deborah,
I'm glad you've called.</i>

09:26.108 --> 09:27.359
<i>It's wonderful
to hear from you.</i>

09:27.943 --> 09:29.570
<i>I'm guessing
you got our letter.</i>

09:29.653 --> 09:31.238
<i>It's why I'm calling.</i>

09:31.822 --> 09:34.116
Irving's just sent us notice of a
suit to be filed in the High Court

09:34.199 --> 09:36.118
<i>because we've failed
to withdraw the book.</i>

09:36.577 --> 09:38.912
The High Court?
<i>The High Court in London.</i>

09:38.996 --> 09:40.330
<i>It's a libel suit.</i>

09:40.414 --> 09:44.251
He's saying you're part of a
concerted worldwide conspiracy

09:44.334 --> 09:47.087
to rob him of his reputation
as a professional historian

09:47.588 --> 09:49.131
<i>and thereby of his livelihood.</i>

09:49.214 --> 09:51.008
I wish.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.676
So what's the next step?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.513
Next step is, you tell us
if you want to fight.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.179
<i>...a throng with 400 skinheads,
neo-Nazis</i>

10:37.262 --> 10:39.890
<i>and supporters of
extreme right-wing groups.</i>

10:39.973 --> 10:42.142
<i>The British historian
David Irving,</i>

10:42.225 --> 10:44.519
<i>speaking in German,
addressed the rally...</i>

10:47.272 --> 10:49.066
<i>...telling them that
Germans no longer</i>

10:49.149 --> 10:50.817
<i>had anything to be ashamed of.</i>

10:50.901 --> 10:53.487
<i>Praising Hitler's deputy,
Rudolf Hess,</i>

10:53.570 --> 10:56.239
<i>as a German hero and a martyr.</i>

11:05.749 --> 11:07.584
<i>According to
the evidence I've seen,</i>

11:08.210 --> 11:10.671
<i>there were no gas chambers
anywhere at Auschwitz.</i>

11:11.088 --> 11:13.423
<i>I'm dealing with Auschwitz
because it's the capital ship</i>

11:13.507 --> 11:15.342
<i>of the whole
Holocaust campaign.</i>

11:15.425 --> 11:17.594
<i>Now if Auschwitz sinks,
and it is, believe me,</i>

11:17.678 --> 11:19.346
<i>a very leaky vessel indeed,</i>

11:19.846 --> 11:22.391
<i>then the whole Holocaust
campaign is in doubt.</i>

11:28.772 --> 11:31.858
<i>I've decided. I'm taking him on.
What?</i>

11:32.109 --> 11:33.527
Why are you letting
him get to you?

11:33.610 --> 11:36.029
Nine-tenths of these things
don't even get to court.

11:36.113 --> 11:38.699
They don't get to court 'cause
people settle. I can't settle.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.701
The man's a liar.
Someone needs to say so.

11:40.784 --> 11:43.245
What I don't get,
why has he chosen you?

11:43.328 --> 11:44.413
Know what I think?

11:45.288 --> 11:47.708
I have two essential
qualifications for David Irving.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.501
I'm a woman and I'm a Jew.

11:50.001 --> 11:51.712
He gets more bang
for his buck.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.506
So this is your book
on denial he's objecting to?

11:54.589 --> 11:56.425
Correct.
Did you even mention Irving?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.801
What did you say about him?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.220
I think I called him
a Hitler partisan

12:00.303 --> 12:01.513
who distorted evidence

12:01.596 --> 12:04.474
in order to reach historically
untenable conclusions.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.812
Okay, well, maybe you better
get yourself lawyered up.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.576
Here you go.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.077
You must be Anthony Julius.

12:24.161 --> 12:25.662
And you must be
Deborah Lipstadt.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.664
Please.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.543
Good of you to come all this way.
It's my pleasure.

12:31.626 --> 12:33.628
And it's nice to combine
our meeting with a lecture.

12:33.712 --> 12:36.339
Anti-Semitism
in the poetry of T.S. Eliot.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.258
Yes, correct.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.177
I'm looking forward
to hearing you speak.

12:40.594 --> 12:42.679
You're not afraid of
taking on the big boys.

12:42.763 --> 12:43.930
I try not to be.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.098
In fact I was wondering

12:45.182 --> 12:47.392
if it was my interest
in anti-Semitism

12:47.476 --> 12:49.978
which made you consider
me to represent you.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.773
In fact not.
Or if it was the Diana thing.

12:52.856 --> 12:54.775
Uh, no.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.943
Someone I know said to me,

12:57.027 --> 12:58.278
"You need a junkyard dog

12:58.361 --> 13:00.155
"and in England
that's Anthony Julius."

13:00.238 --> 13:02.073
Right, right.
Junkyard dog...

13:02.157 --> 13:04.034
Oh, someone who's gonna be
ferocious in court.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.119
Oh, well, I'm afraid
I don't appear in court.

13:06.203 --> 13:08.330
I prepare the case,
I don't present it.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.290
In Britain,
solicitor and barrister

13:10.373 --> 13:11.625
are two quite
different functions.

13:12.876 --> 13:15.837
And, uh, you mentioned
"the Diana thing." I...

13:16.421 --> 13:17.756
I don't know what that is.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.342
Diana is the...
Is the Princess of Wales.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.052
Well, yes,
I know that.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.596
I just don't know what
your connection to her is.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.389
Uh, no, just, um,

13:26.473 --> 13:31.311
that Diana needed a divorce
and I acted for her.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.064
You represented her?

13:34.439 --> 13:35.482
Yes, yes.

13:35.565 --> 13:38.235
But I thought
you did defamation.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.736
Well, you're quite right.
I... I...

13:39.820 --> 13:41.238
I put that point
to Diana herself.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.115
I said, "I've never handled
a divorce case before."

13:44.199 --> 13:46.660
And she said,
"That's all right, Mr. Julius.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.371
"I've never been
divorced before."

13:52.332 --> 13:53.542
Interesting woman.

13:54.751 --> 13:55.919
Deborah, I have to warn you

13:56.002 --> 13:58.505
that there's a reason why he's
bringing the case in London.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.841
I wondered about that.
Thank you very much.

14:00.924 --> 14:02.217
You're welcome.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
It's to his advantage.

14:04.427 --> 14:05.554
Over here in America,

14:05.637 --> 14:07.597
uh, if you're accused
of defaming someone,

14:07.681 --> 14:10.100
then it's up to them to prove
that what you said is untrue.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.518
In the UK,
the reverse is true.

14:11.601 --> 14:13.770
Wait. I have to prove
what I said was true?

14:13.895 --> 14:16.314
Mmm. Correct. Yes, but
I'm the innocent party.

14:16.773 --> 14:17.941
A man accuses you
of something

14:18.024 --> 14:20.110
and it's your job
to prove he's wrong?

14:20.193 --> 14:22.112
It's against natural justice.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.822
In the US there's
a presumption of innocence.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.115
Yeah, not in the UK.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.535
Tricky, isn't it?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.456
So what do you know
about Mr. Irving?

14:33.665 --> 14:35.500
Well, I've read
every word he's written.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.210
I know some of
the personal stuff.

14:37.586 --> 14:39.296
His father abandoned him
when he was four.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.047
He fell in love with Hitler
when he was eight.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.508
His brother said he used to run
around bombed-out buildings in London

14:43.592 --> 14:45.260
during the Blitz shouting,
<i>"Heil</i> Hitler."

14:45.343 --> 14:47.387
He's self-educated.
Extremely proud of it.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.764
He learned his German
working in a factory.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.517
I hear it's perfect.
Yeah. How's yours?

14:52.601 --> 14:53.727
Adequate.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.770
He wants it both ways,
Mr. Irving.

14:55.854 --> 14:58.315
He wants to be the brilliant
maverick, the provocateur

14:58.398 --> 15:00.567
who comes along and reinvents
the Second World War.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.569
But he also wants respect,

15:02.652 --> 15:04.821
the respect of his colleagues
in the club.

15:05.989 --> 15:08.950
England's a club, Deborah,
and he wants to join.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.327
But he's an anti-Semite.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.580
You'd be amazed how many military
historians see that as just a detail.

15:13.663 --> 15:14.998
They see him
as a serious historian

15:15.081 --> 15:17.250
who happens to see things
from Hitler's point of view.

15:17.334 --> 15:18.418
Yeah, but it's not a detail.

15:18.501 --> 15:21.212
You know, I think it's at the center
of everything he thinks and does.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.798
So do I. Yeah. He's a liar
and a falsifier of history.

15:23.882 --> 15:25.842
Yes, and this may be
the chance to say so.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.305
My mother named me Devorah.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.681
You know what it means.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.600
Leader.
Defender of her people.

15:33.892 --> 15:35.185
Warrior.

15:37.062 --> 15:39.648
There was an expectation
when I was a kid.

15:39.731 --> 15:42.108
My mother always said
there was gonna be an event.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.528
That I was picked out.
I was chosen.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.699
Well, here it is.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.042
Good morning.
I think we're expected.

16:09.427 --> 16:12.180
Goodness me. Oh. Ah.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.393
Ah, yes, hello,
delighted to see you.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.686
I'm David Irving.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.063
Here, take Jessica, please.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.817
Darling, Daddy's just going
to be busy for a minute.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.610
Here we are.
A little treat for you.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.821
Yes, open and...

16:27.904 --> 16:30.949
What's it going to be?
A red one. Ooh-oh-oh.

16:32.617 --> 16:33.910
Darling. Bye-bye.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.665
You must be, uh, bringing me
Miss Lipstadt's documents.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.874
Yes.

16:39.958 --> 16:42.252
That's everything that
contributed to her analysis.

16:42.377 --> 16:44.170
The full extent of her research.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.006
You must be
her representatives.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.342
Yes. I'm James Libson
and, uh, this is Miss Tyler.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.679
She's our paralegal.
Paralegals indeed.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.806
David against Goliath, already.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.352
You must work with the,
uh, famous Mr. Julius?

16:59.436 --> 17:00.687
Yes.

17:00.770 --> 17:03.398
Gonna be a fascinating encounter,
don't you think?

17:05.817 --> 17:06.984
Fascinating.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.571
You see, as I see it,
it's academia versus the rest.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.781
Remember, the greatest historians

17:12.866 --> 17:14.826
have never been academics.
We're outsiders.

17:14.992 --> 17:18.747
Cato, Thucydides,
Gibbon, Churchill...

17:19.289 --> 17:20.665
I field a very strong team.

17:20.749 --> 17:21.833
Perhaps you'd like
a cup of tea?

17:21.915 --> 17:24.586
Uh, no, thank you. There's just
one more thing before we leave.

17:25.627 --> 17:26.921
You keep a diary?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.215
Yes, yes, um...

17:29.299 --> 17:31.051
We'd like to apply
to include the diary

17:31.134 --> 17:32.844
in the process of discovery.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.387
Hmm.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.806
You... You're smiling.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.100
Well, I don't much
fancy the prospect

17:39.184 --> 17:41.811
of Miss Lipstadt poring over
my private writings.

17:41.895 --> 17:44.064
Oh, no, no. Access would
be limited to us,

17:44.147 --> 17:45.523
the legal team only.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.488
Come.

17:55.700 --> 17:58.453
I've kept a diary
for 20 years.

18:03.124 --> 18:05.085
I promise,
I've nothing to hide.

18:05.627 --> 18:09.339
But I doubt if even Goliath
has the resources

18:09.422 --> 18:12.842
to read between 10
and 20 million words.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.200
<i>And straightaway you can
see that perhaps tonight,</i>

18:37.283 --> 18:39.953
<i>uh, Gareth Southgate
could be the toast of Rio,</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:41.955
<i>'cause Villa are 2-1 up</i>

18:42.038 --> 18:44.666
<i>at the home of the league
leaders, Leeds United.</i>

18:44.749 --> 18:46.835
<i>Let's get the latest
on that now. Harry Gration.</i>

18:47.377 --> 18:48.753
<i>Yes, Ray,
the new century</i>

18:48.837 --> 18:50.547
<i>and a miracle has
just about happened.</i>

18:50.630 --> 18:52.257
<i>Two goals
from Gareth Southgate</i>

18:52.340 --> 18:53.466
<i>have given Villa
a richly deserved...</i>

19:03.768 --> 19:06.146
All right. That's five...

19:06.229 --> 19:08.606
Yes. No, that's too much.
I need...

19:08.690 --> 19:09.816
Okay.
Lovely.

19:09.899 --> 19:12.485
Have a nice day. Bye.
Cheers, then.

19:25.081 --> 19:26.666
Oh, thank you.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.348
Ah, here she is!

19:42.432 --> 19:44.017
Here she is.
The client. The defendant.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.977
All the way from Atlanta.
Anthony.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.812
You sure you got enough people?

19:47.896 --> 19:49.480
Well, we'll introduce you
to everyone as we go.

19:49.564 --> 19:51.774
But for the moment,
everybody, Deborah Lipstadt.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.776
Say good morning.
Morning, Deborah.

19:53.902 --> 19:55.945
Morning. I'm, uh, Richard Evans.
How do you do?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.488
Hello.
How are you?

19:57.572 --> 20:00.200
Richard is, uh, Professor of
Modern History at Cambridge.

20:00.283 --> 20:02.994
Yes, I know. I know.
I asked for you specifically.

20:03.077 --> 20:04.245
Oh, yes, of course.

20:04.329 --> 20:07.040
Well, uh, Richard is gonna be one
of our eight expert witnesses.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.209
It's a pleasure to meet you.
It's an honor.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.129
Anthony. Is that a...

20:15.048 --> 20:17.050
Is that a note
from the Princess?

20:17.133 --> 20:19.761
Uh, yes, yes,
it is, yes, yes.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.263
Hoping for
a similar result with you.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.224
You wanna do to
the Holocaust deniers

20:24.307 --> 20:25.683
what you did to the monarchy?

20:25.892 --> 20:28.519
Um... Yeah. Sort of.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.605
Well, I think we should argue

20:30.688 --> 20:33.983
that David Irving
is not a real historian.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.818
Oh, right. Well,

20:35.902 --> 20:37.487
we'll be sure to
take that on board.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.239
Thank you so much.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.325
James. James is gonna talk you
through your legal options.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.577
I'm, uh... I'm James Libson.
I work with Anthony.

20:44.661 --> 20:46.537
We've spoken.
Yes, yes, yes. Carry on.

20:47.330 --> 20:49.040
So normally there are,
uh, three routes

20:49.123 --> 20:51.334
that any libel defender
can take, okay?

20:51.417 --> 20:53.920
So, first of all,
you can argue that

20:54.003 --> 20:56.339
Irving is misinterpreting
the offending words.

20:56.464 --> 20:58.424
Mmm-hmm. However, since
at one point in your book

20:58.508 --> 21:02.011
you say that Irving seems to conceive
of himself as continuing Hitler's work,

21:02.095 --> 21:03.930
I don't think we can say
he's misinterpreting anything.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.265
I don't think we can.

21:05.348 --> 21:06.683
Nor can we take
the second route,

21:06.766 --> 21:08.893
which would be just to say
that the offending words

21:08.977 --> 21:10.603
aren't as offensive
as Irving makes out.

21:10.687 --> 21:12.855
Oh, we can't take that route.
No, they're offensive.

21:12.939 --> 21:14.899
I hope so.
God knows I tried to be.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.986
Yeah. So really it does
just leave us with this one option.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.612
We call this
the atom bomb defense.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.072
That's the one
we're gonna go for.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.615
We plead justification.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.951
So even if the words
are defamatory,

21:25.034 --> 21:26.828
they are still
nevertheless true.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.913
Quite. Not every word.
It doesn't have to be every word.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.707
We can get some things wrong.
But we do have to prove,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.458
what we call
"the sting" of the libel.

21:32.542 --> 21:35.211
We argue that Irving deliberately
subordinated the truth

21:35.295 --> 21:36.963
in order to propagate
anti-Semitism

21:37.046 --> 21:38.965
and engender sympathy
for the Third Reich.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.759
More coffee?
No, thank you.

21:41.843 --> 21:43.344
Yeah.
Um...

21:43.428 --> 21:45.430
We are still left with the special
problem that we have in the UK

21:45.513 --> 21:48.141
that the burden of proof
lies with the accused.

21:48.224 --> 21:50.018
Um, I'd like you to listen to Laura.
Have you met Laura?

21:50.101 --> 21:51.352
Miss Lipstadt.
Hello.

21:51.436 --> 21:54.772
Uh, Laura's 23.
Uh, it's her first case.

21:54.856 --> 21:57.358
We've just been discussing this very point.
Attack it, Laura.

21:57.442 --> 22:00.528
We feel... Anthony feels,
oddly in this particular case,

22:00.611 --> 22:01.988
the peculiarity
of the British law

22:02.071 --> 22:04.073
can actually work to our advantage.
Yes. Say.

22:04.532 --> 22:05.992
The first reaction
everyone has

22:06.075 --> 22:07.744
when they hear about
this trial is horror.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.329
More like disbelief. I mean,

22:09.412 --> 22:11.873
a court of law has to be a
lousy place to judge history.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.624
I must agree, as a historian.

22:13.708 --> 22:15.460
They say,
"My God, are you serious?

22:15.543 --> 22:18.129
"You sit down in a court and
some pompous English judge

22:18.212 --> 22:19.839
"rules on whether
the Holocaust happened?"

22:19.922 --> 22:23.343
And let's think about this.
What if we lose? Huh?

22:23.426 --> 22:26.262
It suddenly becomes acceptable,
it becomes respectable

22:26.346 --> 22:27.847
to say the Holocaust
didn't happen?

22:27.930 --> 22:30.350
Has anyone thought about
what that will mean?

22:30.433 --> 22:32.852
But the wonderful thing is,
you see, if we play this right,

22:32.935 --> 22:35.146
it's not going to be Irving
putting the Holocaust on trial.

22:35.313 --> 22:37.273
No. It's going to be us
putting Irving on trial.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.358
Laura's right.
Thank you.

22:38.441 --> 22:40.902
Laura's very sound on this.
And if we focus on his lies,

22:40.985 --> 22:42.945
and, equally important,
his motives for lying,

22:43.029 --> 22:46.908
there's absolutely no reason we should have
to produce eyewitnesses to these horrors.

22:48.910 --> 22:50.536
Wait a minute.
What do you mean,

22:50.620 --> 22:53.039
that the survivors
won't appear?

22:53.122 --> 22:55.041
No, no, no.
No, we don't want them to.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.209
You don't want
their testimony?

22:56.292 --> 22:57.418
No.
Under no circumstances.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.462
Why not? Why the hell not?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.381
Because even to
let survivors appear

23:01.464 --> 23:04.133
would be to legitimize
his right to question them.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.598
Can I say something

23:10.681 --> 23:13.267
before you go any further
with this strategy?

23:13.559 --> 23:14.811
Yeah, please do.

23:15.478 --> 23:18.064
You once said to me that this
trial might have implications

23:18.147 --> 23:19.816
for the whole
of the Jewish people.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.902
Now you're saying you won't
allow the Jews to speak?

23:22.985 --> 23:24.028
Right, I'll explain the thinking

23:24.112 --> 23:25.154
just so you
understand the thinking.

23:25.238 --> 23:27.865
Yes, please, I would love
to understand the thinking.

23:27.949 --> 23:29.242
We believe that
Irving is planning

23:29.325 --> 23:31.702
on being what we call
a litigant in person.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.372
He plans to conduct
his own case.

23:34.455 --> 23:35.498
What do you mean?
He's not hiring lawyers?

23:35.581 --> 23:39.043
No. No, it'll be just him.
Imagine that.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.003
David Irving,
international Holocaust denier,

23:41.087 --> 23:43.381
finally getting his hands
on a survivor. Imagine it.

23:44.048 --> 23:46.592
The hurt. The damage.
The insult.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.261
It's unthinkable.
He's not gonna have that.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.012
I won't allow it.
I won't allow that to happen.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.223
What are you gonna allow?

23:54.016 --> 23:56.102
He keeps a diary.
He has done for years.

23:56.185 --> 23:57.311
He told us
he had nothing to hide,

23:57.395 --> 23:59.772
but we still had to subpoena
him to get hold of it.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.900
What, you've spoken
to him in person?

24:02.984 --> 24:04.944
Yes, yes, we have.

24:05.027 --> 24:08.114
Deborah, the first rule of a good
defense is a strong offense.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.615
First rule?
First rule of litigation,

24:09.699 --> 24:11.284
whether you're prosecuting
or defending,

24:11.367 --> 24:13.244
always run your case
as if you're prosecuting.

24:13.327 --> 24:15.204
It's a good rule.
So that's why Laura

24:15.329 --> 24:17.957
is leading this group of researchers here.
They joined last week.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.917
And they're gonna be
combing through all the diaries,

24:20.001 --> 24:22.462
uh, looking in particular for any
contact with right-wing groups.

24:22.545 --> 24:25.590
Neo-Nazis, skinheads,
anti-Semites, SS revival groups,

24:25.673 --> 24:27.216
all kinds of
assorted riffraff.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.010
And, just as important,
Professor Evans here,

24:29.093 --> 24:31.512
with his, um, his two
able graduate students,

24:31.596 --> 24:34.891
Nik Wachsman and Thomas, uh...

24:35.475 --> 24:38.019
Thomas Skelton-Robinson.

24:38.102 --> 24:39.812
My team will be
doing the historiography.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.690
Examining every published word
Irving ever wrote.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.859
Checking sources,
comparing editions.

24:44.942 --> 24:47.487
Generally testing the
reliability of his history.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.322
You can't imagine
what fun we're having.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.282
We're gonna end up with
a charge sheet of inaccuracies

24:51.365 --> 24:53.701
as long as your arm.
One mistake after another.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.537
We think it'll take
about a year. Full-time.

24:58.664 --> 25:02.418
Well, I'm glad that you guys
have got it all sewn up.

25:02.502 --> 25:04.754
We aim to.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.590
Okay, well, thanks
very much, everyone.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.096
As you know, uh,

25:14.180 --> 25:16.098
we had been planning to
do everything for free.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.809
But given the mounting
scale of the thing,

25:18.893 --> 25:21.771
I think we may need to revisit
the question of charges.

25:22.605 --> 25:24.899
Of course, if we lose,

25:24.982 --> 25:26.692
the firm will be happy
to carry the cost.

25:26.776 --> 25:28.986
But we will need
some support.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.032
So you are allowing me
to do something?

25:33.115 --> 25:35.326
Um, I get to go fundraise?

25:35.576 --> 25:36.702
Uh...

25:36.786 --> 25:38.955
Yes, yes, if, um...

25:39.789 --> 25:41.123
Whatever you can do.

25:46.295 --> 25:50.633
<i>I think people here do
have concerns about the trial.</i>

25:51.008 --> 25:53.094
The community's very keen
to support you.

25:53.678 --> 25:56.180
Mmm-hmm.
I'm glad to hear it.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.976
But we're also interested
to know what you're thinking.

26:00.059 --> 26:03.646
Mr. Julius is
a very brilliant young man.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.772
He is.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.984
Can we speak frankly?
Please, please.

26:08.901 --> 26:13.489
There's... There's some fear you
may have fallen under his spell.

26:14.198 --> 26:15.825
You won't be
the first woman

26:15.908 --> 26:17.660
to be attracted
to his intellect.

26:18.119 --> 26:20.329
Diana.

26:24.625 --> 26:28.671
So far, I've raised, um,
most of my funds back home.

26:29.171 --> 26:31.299
Was that easy?
It wasn't difficult.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.927
Not as difficult as in London,
is that what you're saying?

26:35.011 --> 26:37.263
There's a principle
and I've stuck to it.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.557
No single source of finance.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.852
There was one man, he offered
to pay for the whole thing.

26:43.394 --> 26:45.938
But when the history of this
moment comes to be written,

26:46.022 --> 26:49.900
I think it's important
many people gave, not one.

26:51.027 --> 26:52.361
You talk about history.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.447
Look at it from
our point of view.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.657
We live with David Irving.
He's British.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.034
And he's a has-been.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.119
What's a trial gonna do?

27:00.202 --> 27:01.871
It's gonna give him
a new lease of life.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.623
Well, I can't help that

27:03.706 --> 27:05.374
because I didn't bring
the prosecution.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.459
He did.
No,

27:06.542 --> 27:08.252
but you could prevent the
whole thing from happening.

27:08.336 --> 27:09.670
How would I do that?
Settle.

27:12.715 --> 27:13.841
I mean it.

27:14.925 --> 27:17.595
Sign some piece of paper.
Is that so terrible?

27:18.596 --> 27:20.389
He's never gonna
give you Auschwitz, okay,

27:20.473 --> 27:23.643
but, then, he's...
He's David Irving.

27:23.726 --> 27:24.769
We've lived with worse.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.604
And what would you
want me to settle for?

27:26.979 --> 27:28.981
Four million dead? Three? One?

27:29.065 --> 27:30.900
What number would you
be comfortable with?

27:31.942 --> 27:35.029
Here in England, you may like
appeasement, but I don't.

27:35.112 --> 27:37.323
I don't think you should be
using a word like appeasement.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.783
No? Then what word
should I use?

27:38.866 --> 27:42.244
All we're saying,
beware of Anthony Julius.

27:42.870 --> 27:45.414
He does these things
for his own glory.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.625
Other women have been
in his pocket

27:47.708 --> 27:49.460
and found it an uncomfortable
place to be.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.921
Oh, well, if it's
pockets we're talking about,

27:52.004 --> 27:55.049
maybe you can explain why the British
find theirs so hard to open.

28:02.723 --> 28:04.725
<i>The area forecast
for the next 24 hours.</i>

28:05.518 --> 28:08.270
<i>Viking, North and South Utsire, 40.</i>

28:08.688 --> 28:10.940
<i>South westerly,
veering northwesterly,</i>

28:11.023 --> 28:14.694
<i>6 to gale 8,
perhaps severe gale 9 later.</i>

28:14.777 --> 28:17.655
<i>Rain, wintry showers,
moderate or full...</i>

28:39.218 --> 28:40.845
<i>I had a hellish
night last night.</i>

28:40.928 --> 28:43.055
I couldn't sleep.
I was so angry.

28:43.139 --> 28:44.265
Really? Why?

28:44.348 --> 28:46.517
I had dinner last
night with some

28:46.600 --> 28:48.436
leaders of
the Jewish community.

28:48.519 --> 28:50.646
Oh, the community, huh?

28:50.730 --> 28:53.858
And did the community tell you it would
suit them better if you dropped the case?

28:53.941 --> 28:55.651
I was defending you.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.111
I'm sure you did
a very good job.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.863
Maybe you should
take it up professionally.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.074
They think you took
this case for your own glory.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.869
Glory? Gosh. I hadn't
thought about glory.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.496
Glory? Fascinating. So what
did they give you to eat?

29:09.707 --> 29:12.793
I don't understand this thing,
I really don't. Oh, here we are.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.880
Richard Rampton,
Deborah Lipstadt.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.214
Ah!

29:17.548 --> 29:19.258
"'Tis the author
of our misfortune."

29:19.341 --> 29:20.926
Please, please, please,
come in.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.511
Come in and warm yourself.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.929
Hi.
Hello.

29:24.013 --> 29:25.556
Richard will be
your leading counsel.

29:25.639 --> 29:26.932
I've explained to
Deborah the difference

29:27.016 --> 29:28.350
between barrister
and solicitor.

29:28.851 --> 29:31.395
Our legal system seems forbidding
but it works, I think.

29:31.479 --> 29:33.981
If your legal system worked,
I wouldn't be in this mess.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.649
I don't mind Dickensian,

29:35.691 --> 29:38.694
it's Kafkaesque I'm worried about.

29:39.236 --> 29:42.406
And this is our junior
counsel, Heather Rogers.

29:42.490 --> 29:43.699
How are you?
Hi, Heather.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.451
Look, I've...
I've just opened up

29:45.534 --> 29:47.286
this rather
decent bottle of red.

29:47.369 --> 29:48.579
Hope you don't mind plastic?

29:48.662 --> 29:50.414
No, Richard,
I'm not gonna drink.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.458
I haven't eaten.
And Deborah hasn't slept.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.126
No, I'll taste the wine.
Why not?

29:54.210 --> 29:55.920
Everything else is
being decided for me.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.383
Yes, so Heather and I have been
introducing ourselves to the subject.

30:01.467 --> 30:05.471
Hmm. I can see that.
A little light reading.

30:05.888 --> 30:07.223
Oh, is this you?

30:08.307 --> 30:09.558
You catch fish?

30:10.518 --> 30:11.894
Yes, I do.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.397
And how's your German?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.233
Ah, you see?
Just like a barrister.

30:17.316 --> 30:18.651
Go straight to my weak point.

30:19.026 --> 30:21.487
Um, well, I know the libretto
to <i>The Magic Flute.</i>

30:21.570 --> 30:24.281
That's, uh... That's all
the German I have.

30:24.365 --> 30:27.159
It's probably not very useful
in our forthcoming encounter.

30:27.243 --> 30:28.202
Anyway, cheers.

30:28.285 --> 30:29.286
Cheers.

30:30.621 --> 30:31.914
Cheers, Heather.

30:32.540 --> 30:35.668
Yes, I was going to get on
with my <i>Life of Mozart,</i>

30:36.085 --> 30:39.004
but I shall have to postpone.
Again.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.674
Richard is the most skillful
advocate in the country.

30:41.757 --> 30:43.050
I don't mind saying it.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.095
Yes, well,
in this case I wish I...

30:46.512 --> 30:48.806
I wish I thought
skill were enough.

30:49.765 --> 30:50.933
What else do you need?

30:51.767 --> 30:53.435
A rarer quality.

30:54.019 --> 30:55.271
Such as?

30:57.773 --> 30:59.066
Appetite.

31:00.985 --> 31:04.446
Plainly, I shall have
to go to Auschwitz

31:04.530 --> 31:07.533
and I would be very grateful
if you would accompany me.

31:07.616 --> 31:09.076
Why do you need
to go to Auschwitz?

31:10.786 --> 31:12.329
Legal reasons.

32:25.694 --> 32:27.071
<i>Is he coming?</i>

32:28.989 --> 32:31.367
He wants us here, and then
he doesn't show up.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.203
He's late, that's all.
He's often late.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.621
Is he late for court?

33:11.907 --> 33:13.158
Morning, everyone.

33:13.367 --> 33:15.744
You must be Professor Van Pelt?
I am.

33:15.828 --> 33:17.955
Good. So, uh, let's
get down to business.

33:18.288 --> 33:19.623
Heather. Deborah.

33:20.582 --> 33:22.042
I suggest we start
by taking a walk

33:22.126 --> 33:23.711
around the perimeter fence.

33:23.794 --> 33:24.795
Yeah, I just did that.

33:26.964 --> 33:29.508
Good. Then let's
look at the plans. Omer?

33:30.342 --> 33:33.137
I want you to understand
the scale of the operation.

33:33.220 --> 33:34.888
What we are looking at here
is one of the largest

33:34.972 --> 33:36.849
and most efficient killing
machines in human history.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.184
Yeah. Yes, we know what it is.
It's how we prove what it is,

33:39.268 --> 33:40.352
that's what
we're interested in.

33:40.436 --> 33:43.731
We're not here on a pilgrimage,
we're preparing a case.

33:43.814 --> 33:45.315
Okay.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.529
These are the remains
of Crematorium ll.

33:52.448 --> 33:55.159
The buildings were deliberately
demolished by the Germans

33:55.242 --> 33:57.202
in the autumn of 1944

33:57.286 --> 33:59.496
to destroy the evidence
of what they did here.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.377
They dynamited them again

34:05.461 --> 34:07.588
one week before
the end of the war.

34:10.466 --> 34:13.802
These steps led down
into the undressing room.

34:20.225 --> 34:21.518
The Olère drawings, please.

34:23.395 --> 34:26.815
David Olère was a French artist.
A survivor.

34:26.899 --> 34:29.318
He was able to draw
a lot of what he saw here.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.862
He made a drawing
of this arrangement here.

34:33.989 --> 34:37.326
These are the steps
in the drawing.

34:46.168 --> 34:47.753
Then they were
led through here,

34:47.835 --> 34:50.630
past a sign that said,
"To the Baths"

34:51.672 --> 34:54.176
and into the gas chamber...

34:55.302 --> 34:56.553
Here.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.057
Please watch your step.
Tread carefully.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.309
This is a shrine.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.445
What we are standing on here

35:13.529 --> 35:16.448
is all that remains
of the gas chamber itself.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.117
This was the roof.

35:29.837 --> 35:31.505
The chamber was
right under here.

35:31.588 --> 35:32.881
Under our feet.

35:38.887 --> 35:44.059
The doors were locked and
cyanide crystals, Zyklon-B,

35:44.143 --> 35:46.812
were poured in on them
through holes in the roof.

35:47.396 --> 35:49.148
One, two, three, four.

36:06.748 --> 36:08.792
Ow! Shit.

36:17.551 --> 36:18.760
It... It's okay.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.376
Now here are
the delousing chambers.

36:51.460 --> 36:54.254
Typhus was a terrible
problem in the camp

36:54.338 --> 36:57.090
and the lice that carried it
had to be destroyed.

36:57.174 --> 36:58.383
Right, now we get to it.

36:58.467 --> 37:00.677
So we need to
talk about Leuchter.

37:00.761 --> 37:02.679
Yes, I'm coming to Leuchter.
Yeah.

37:05.766 --> 37:09.895
This building was used to
delouse the prisoners' clothing.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.231
They used Zyklon-B
for that, too.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.024
To kill the lice.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.401
We know that?
Yes.

37:16.944 --> 37:18.612
For sure?
You have proof?

37:18.695 --> 37:20.405
We can't take
anything for granted.

37:20.489 --> 37:21.531
I need to see the proof.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.158
Yes, I can give you proof.

37:23.742 --> 37:27.204
However, in February 1988,

37:27.287 --> 37:31.333
a Holocaust denier called
Ernst Zündel sent Fred Leuchter,

37:31.416 --> 37:35.629
an engineer and self-styled
execution expert from America,

37:35.712 --> 37:37.422
to test in different
parts of the camp

37:37.506 --> 37:40.092
for evidence of poison gas
in the brickwork.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.928
Traces of hydrogen cyanide, HCN.

37:43.011 --> 37:46.139
The blue stains here

37:47.599 --> 37:48.809
and here.

37:48.892 --> 37:50.519
He came with a chisel?

37:50.978 --> 37:52.062
That's right.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.189
And he hacked away...
Correct.

37:54.273 --> 37:55.983
...illegally, without any permission

37:56.066 --> 37:57.567
from the authorities,

37:57.943 --> 38:01.530
and then he smuggled the pieces
out of Poland in his suitcase,

38:01.613 --> 38:03.115
wrapped in his dirty underwear.

38:03.282 --> 38:05.909
Be that as it may.
We can criticize his methods,

38:05.993 --> 38:08.120
but it's his conclusions
we have to discredit.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.664
He found higher levels of HCN

38:10.747 --> 38:12.374
here in the delousing chambers

38:12.457 --> 38:14.626
than he did in
the gas chambers themselves.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.253
From this he concluded that

38:16.336 --> 38:18.422
no human beings
were killed at Auschwitz.

38:18.505 --> 38:21.717
Only...
Only lice were killed.

38:23.093 --> 38:25.053
Why are we talking
about Leuchter?

38:25.220 --> 38:27.639
I mean, he's really not worth
the paper he's written on.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.808
Well, so you say.
Now say why.

38:29.891 --> 38:31.184
I'll tell you why.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.979
Because of course there was a
higher concentration in here.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.523
It takes 20 times more cyanide

38:36.606 --> 38:39.026
to kill lice than it
does human beings.

38:39.109 --> 38:41.903
Twenty times!
Just Leuchter didn't know that.

38:42.612 --> 38:44.489
Oh, this whole thing
is infuriating.

38:44.573 --> 38:46.408
I know.
It beggars belief.

38:47.159 --> 38:50.412
Why has there not been a proper
scientific study of this whole site?

38:50.495 --> 38:52.164
By reputable scientists?

38:52.247 --> 38:53.999
Fifty years since the fact?

38:54.916 --> 38:57.002
I mean, it's ridiculous.

38:57.085 --> 38:59.296
Where's the proof?
Where's the evidence?

38:59.379 --> 39:00.464
I need to know that.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.716
You know what? This is a place
where you show respect.

39:02.799 --> 39:04.843
Whoever you are,
you show respect.

39:04.926 --> 39:06.428
I have to ask
some more questions.

39:06.511 --> 39:07.971
Would you be happier outside?

39:10.223 --> 39:11.183
What proof is there

39:11.266 --> 39:13.018
that Leuchter's conclusions
are wrong?

39:16.438 --> 39:19.191
I thought we weren't
gonna try the Holocaust.

39:20.734 --> 39:23.820
We're not. I thought we
weren't gonna debate,

39:23.904 --> 39:25.197
"Did the Holocaust happen?"

39:25.280 --> 39:26.531
That's what we agreed, Heather.

39:26.615 --> 39:28.075
That's what we agreed.

39:30.285 --> 39:31.912
He's asking questions,
that's all.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.789
He has to ask questions.

39:34.331 --> 39:37.084
This isn't about memorializing,

39:37.167 --> 39:38.668
it's about forensics.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.032
God full of mercy
who dwells in the heights,

40:10.242 --> 40:14.663
provide a sure rest upon
the Divine Presence's wings,

40:15.414 --> 40:17.916
in the realm of the holy,
pure and glorious...

40:17.999 --> 40:19.501
Pure and glorious,

40:19.584 --> 40:23.130
...whose shining resembles the sky.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.059
I, um, bought you a drink.

41:59.851 --> 42:01.478
I thought
you might need it.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.272
Thanks. I think I do.

42:07.234 --> 42:08.944
You get what you wanted
from the visit?

42:11.655 --> 42:13.281
Deborah, you mustn't
characterize me

42:13.365 --> 42:14.783
as being without feelings.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.994
I have feelings.
What did you feel today?

42:19.913 --> 42:21.122
Oh.

42:24.751 --> 42:26.127
Shame.

42:27.587 --> 42:31.591
I have this terrible fear
that if I'd have been ordered

42:31.675 --> 42:34.135
to do some of the things
we saw today that...

42:36.221 --> 42:37.347
That I would have agreed.

42:37.806 --> 42:39.140
Out of weakness.

42:39.516 --> 42:41.393
Well, that is honest
of you to say so.

42:41.476 --> 42:44.271
Well, that's how it is.
The world is full of cowards

42:44.354 --> 42:47.023
and I've always had
this nervous feeling that...

42:48.191 --> 42:49.651
That I was one of them.

42:50.694 --> 42:52.237
There's this line from Goethe,

42:53.321 --> 42:57.534
<i>"Der Fiege droht nur,
wo er sicher ist."</i>

42:57.617 --> 43:00.870
It means,
"The coward only threatens

43:00.954 --> 43:02.497
"when he feels secure."

43:03.373 --> 43:05.834
I thought you didn't speak German.
Hmm..

43:06.084 --> 43:08.295
You learned German
in the last year?

43:08.378 --> 43:10.755
Well, I had to master
all these documents.

43:10.839 --> 43:12.841
Irving had a 40-year
start on me,

43:12.924 --> 43:14.009
so I had to catch up.

43:14.092 --> 43:15.176
Did you?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.804
No.

43:21.516 --> 43:24.352
You know, you haven't
taken my statement yet.

43:25.437 --> 43:28.481
No. No, I...
Why is that?

43:29.816 --> 43:32.277
No. Why?
Anthony didn't talk to you?

43:34.863 --> 43:39.534
Well, um, we made
a couple of decisions.

43:39.909 --> 43:44.414
Uh, the first was that we don't
want to put this case to a jury.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.875
We think it'll be safer
to put it to a judge.

43:48.001 --> 43:49.419
A single judge?
Yeah.

43:49.502 --> 43:51.713
What, the whole thing
decided by one man?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.256
Is that a good idea?

43:53.340 --> 43:55.216
Well, we were worried
about the kind of antics

43:55.300 --> 43:57.677
that Irving might get up
to with an audience of 12.

43:57.761 --> 43:59.512
I'm surprised it's our choice.

43:59.596 --> 44:02.098
Well, it isn't.
He has to agree.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.642
Why would he do that?

44:04.893 --> 44:06.436
We have a notion.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.355
Mmm.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.358
And the other one?
I'm sorry?

44:11.441 --> 44:13.068
Well, you said
a couple of decisions.

44:14.736 --> 44:16.404
Yes, well, um...

44:17.906 --> 44:20.533
We decided,
Anthony and I, that, um,

44:22.577 --> 44:25.705
it would be better
if you didn't testify.

44:28.291 --> 44:31.086
Excuse me?
Well, that's it. We...

44:31.753 --> 44:33.838
We don't believe
you should testify.

44:35.090 --> 44:36.383
Why?

44:37.592 --> 44:40.303
Because you don't trust me?
No. No, not at all.

44:40.387 --> 44:42.097
You think I'm gonna
get emotional?

44:42.430 --> 44:45.266
Well, I... After today...

44:45.517 --> 44:47.727
Richard, we were at Auschwitz.

44:48.436 --> 44:50.730
Let me remind you
that I teach,

44:50.814 --> 44:52.357
I lecture,
I talk to the press...

44:52.440 --> 44:54.150
I know.
I order ideas.

44:54.234 --> 44:55.860
It's what I do.
It's what I'm good at.

44:55.944 --> 44:57.529
You... You don't need
to protect me.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.114
No, we're not protecting you.

44:59.197 --> 45:00.782
We're protecting our case.

45:01.533 --> 45:05.829
Our strategy is to keep the focus
on Irving and Irving alone.

45:06.121 --> 45:08.998
It's not a test of your
credibility, it's a test of his.

45:09.833 --> 45:10.917
You don't think
I'm good enough.

45:11.000 --> 45:13.044
No, no, no.
I didn't say that at all.

45:13.294 --> 45:17.132
Everything you have to say,
you've said in your book.

45:17.966 --> 45:20.885
Our task is to starve Irving,

45:20.969 --> 45:23.638
and putting you in a witness
box would feed him.

45:24.639 --> 45:26.641
This case is
happening to you,

45:26.975 --> 45:28.309
but it's not about you.

45:28.393 --> 45:31.062
This man hates me.
He's coming for me.

45:31.146 --> 45:32.939
And when someone
comes after you,

45:33.022 --> 45:34.482
you take 'em on.

45:39.362 --> 45:40.947
You know what people will say?

45:42.157 --> 45:44.033
Yes, I think I do.
They'll say I'm a coward.

45:44.117 --> 45:45.535
That I was too afraid
to go on the stand

45:45.618 --> 45:46.911
because I thought I would lose.
Yeah.

45:46.995 --> 45:49.330
That's what they'll say.
And you want me to live with that?

45:52.333 --> 45:55.128
It's the price you pay
for winning.

46:01.426 --> 46:03.011
<i>Uh, just one question, sir.</i>

46:03.094 --> 46:04.095
<i>What is it?</i>

46:04.345 --> 46:05.388
Uh, on our side,

46:05.472 --> 46:07.557
we're beginning to feel
that for the layman

46:07.640 --> 46:09.726
this particular subject
may represent

46:09.809 --> 46:11.186
an impossible challenge.

46:11.936 --> 46:15.857
I see. You're asking to
dispense with a jury? We are.

46:16.983 --> 46:19.027
Have you asked
Mr. Irving his views?

46:19.110 --> 46:21.154
Mr. Irving?
Well, um...

46:21.237 --> 46:22.614
Perhaps before
Mr. Irving speaks?

46:22.697 --> 46:23.865
Yes, go ahead.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.869
We all know Mr. Irving
has devoted his life

46:27.952 --> 46:29.871
to the study
of the Third Reich.

46:30.371 --> 46:32.624
I admit myself to having
sometimes struggled

46:32.707 --> 46:34.000
with the demands
of the material.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.002
I wonder if Mr. Irving
really believes it's fair

46:36.085 --> 46:39.172
to ask the regular Joe or Joan
who walks in from the street

46:39.255 --> 46:40.548
to grasp in a mere few weeks

46:40.632 --> 46:43.384
what he himself has taken
a lifetime to master.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.599
I agree.

46:50.683 --> 46:53.228
The issues before the court
are sufficiently complex

46:54.062 --> 46:56.147
to require the attention
of a learned judge,

46:56.231 --> 46:58.817
and too complex
to confront a jury with.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.653
Are you sure, Mr. Irving?

47:03.905 --> 47:05.031
Quite sure.

47:06.074 --> 47:08.076
Trial by judge alone it is, then.

47:08.660 --> 47:09.994
Thank you very much, sir.

47:33.601 --> 47:35.019
This morning
we'll see the beginning

47:35.103 --> 47:36.771
of an extraordinary case
in which...

47:36.855 --> 47:39.274
...question the evidence
for the mass killing of Jewish people

47:39.357 --> 47:40.733
at Auschwitz during
the Second World War.

47:40.817 --> 47:42.777
...including the movie director,
Steven Spielberg,

47:42.861 --> 47:45.029
are paying for
Miss Lipstadt's defense.

47:45.113 --> 47:47.031
Mr. Irving is rumored to have

47:47.115 --> 47:49.617
a list of around
4,000 contributors...

47:49.701 --> 47:51.870
Miss Lipstadt's book,
in which she refers

47:51.953 --> 47:54.747
to Mr. Irving as
a Holocaust denier.

47:55.331 --> 47:56.875
Morning, Deborah. Morning.

47:56.958 --> 47:58.251
I didn't want you
to go in alone.

47:58.334 --> 48:00.086
Sweet of you.
It's not sweet at all.

48:00.169 --> 48:01.546
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't speak.

48:01.629 --> 48:04.090
It's a short statement.
No, no, no. This way.

48:04.173 --> 48:05.717
Come on.
Professor!

48:06.301 --> 48:08.469
Julie McCarthy, NPR.
A quick word.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.305
We need to hear your voice.

48:10.847 --> 48:13.725
It's Julie McCarthy, NPR.
We need to hear your voice.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.977
Just a quick word.
Lying Jewish bitch!

48:16.060 --> 48:18.146
You think it all finished with Hitler?
It didn't.

48:18.229 --> 48:20.815
We know which hotel you're in.
We know your room.

48:20.899 --> 48:23.401
You think you're safe.
Well, you're not.

48:37.999 --> 48:40.126
Morning. Morning, everyone.
Morning, everyone.

48:40.209 --> 48:42.587
Good morning, everyone.
I'm looking forward to this.

48:42.670 --> 48:44.005
May I say a few words?

48:44.714 --> 48:45.798
Well, obviously...

48:52.180 --> 48:54.140
Do you see that? He's gonna be
all over the front pages.

48:54.223 --> 48:57.310
Deborah, there's only one person
that matters and that's the judge.

48:57.393 --> 48:59.437
If you don't speak in court
and you do speak to the press,

48:59.520 --> 49:01.606
the judge is gonna be
furious and with just cause.

49:01.689 --> 49:03.858
And we both know what
would solve that problem.

49:05.026 --> 49:07.904
Another thing. You jog
the same way every day.

49:08.571 --> 49:09.656
Don't.

49:10.531 --> 49:12.575
What are you saying?
I'm not saying anything.

49:12.659 --> 49:14.786
I'm just saying,
vary your route. Come on.

49:14.869 --> 49:15.995
Vary my route?

49:16.079 --> 49:17.413
Stay with her.

49:17.872 --> 49:19.666
What, you think
you can get away with it?

49:19.749 --> 49:21.542
<i>Let's have some order!</i>

49:21.626 --> 49:23.586
Please. Press in
the public gallery.

49:23.670 --> 49:25.213
Front two rows.
Take the door on the left.

49:25.296 --> 49:26.798
Hello, Nik.
Janet.

49:26.881 --> 49:29.425
General public upstairs.
General public upstairs. Thank you.

49:29.509 --> 49:31.094
Let the defendant
through, please.

49:31.177 --> 49:33.262
This way, Miss Lipstadt.
Thank you, Clive.

49:34.639 --> 49:37.266
They were lively.
Yes.

49:38.434 --> 49:40.603
How are you? All right?
Fine, fine.

49:41.270 --> 49:42.438
Just through here.

49:46.776 --> 49:48.236
This is me?
This is you.

49:49.070 --> 49:50.905
Good morning. Good morning.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.161
Morning, Mr. Irving.
Good morning.

49:57.245 --> 49:58.496
Good morning.
Morning.

49:58.579 --> 49:59.789
Good morning.
Good morning.

49:59.872 --> 50:01.040
Morning.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.672
Good morning. I'll just
take that for you.

50:07.755 --> 50:08.840
Thank you.
There we are.

50:09.799 --> 50:12.844
As advertised.
David and Goliath.

50:21.352 --> 50:22.645
<i>They're ready, my Lord.</i>

50:53.843 --> 50:55.303
Silence!

50:56.220 --> 50:57.638
Court rise!

51:00.725 --> 51:01.893
Bow.

51:01.976 --> 51:03.811
Bow.
I'm American.

51:04.187 --> 51:05.772
Everything else but no bowing.

51:17.116 --> 51:18.201
My Lord...

51:18.951 --> 51:23.081
I intend to show that far from
being a Holocaust denier,

51:23.164 --> 51:24.832
I have repeatedly
drawn attention

51:24.916 --> 51:27.794
to major aspects
of the Holocaust.

51:29.128 --> 51:31.589
These defendants
have done very real damage

51:31.672 --> 51:33.758
to my professional existence.

51:33.841 --> 51:36.594
By virtue of the activities
of Miss Lipstadt

51:36.677 --> 51:39.430
and those who funded her
and guided her hand,

51:39.514 --> 51:41.432
since 1996

51:41.516 --> 51:45.561
I have seen one fearful publisher
after another falling away from me

51:45.645 --> 51:48.106
and turning their backs
on me as I approach.

51:49.690 --> 51:50.858
My Lord,

51:51.692 --> 51:54.278
if we were to seek a title
for this libel action,

51:54.362 --> 51:57.990
I would venture to suggest
<i>Pictures at an Execution.</i>

51:58.866 --> 52:00.201
My execution.

52:03.121 --> 52:06.707
The word "denier"
is particularly evil.

52:07.041 --> 52:08.584
For the chosen victim

52:09.377 --> 52:12.880
it is like being called
a wife beater or a pedophile.

52:14.882 --> 52:17.343
It is enough for the label
to be attached

52:17.426 --> 52:20.388
for the attachee to
be designated a pariah,

52:20.805 --> 52:22.807
an outcast from
normal society.

52:24.892 --> 52:28.229
It is a verbal Yellow Star.

52:31.983 --> 52:33.526
<i>So, what did you think of him?</i>

52:33.609 --> 52:36.070
I thought he was oddly impressive.
Did you?

52:36.154 --> 52:37.363
Well, did you enjoy it?

52:37.446 --> 52:39.031
Look, there he is.
Look, still at it.

52:39.198 --> 52:42.201
It was confusing. It was like
he already knew all of our questions.

52:42.285 --> 52:44.412
Well, yes, of course he does.
We sent them to him.

52:45.454 --> 52:48.416
What? You sent him our
questions in advance? What...

52:49.417 --> 52:51.335
Why would you give away
our strategy?

52:51.419 --> 52:53.379
Deborah, there is no strategy.

52:54.297 --> 52:56.257
We're gonna box him in
with the truth.

52:57.466 --> 52:58.843
<i>My Lord,</i>

52:58.926 --> 53:02.597
Mr. Irving calls himself a historian.

53:03.514 --> 53:06.684
The truth is, however, that
he is not a historian at all.

53:07.435 --> 53:09.437
He is a falsifier of history.

53:11.105 --> 53:14.275
To put it bluntly,
he is a liar.

53:16.194 --> 53:18.237
Now, between the publication

53:18.321 --> 53:21.782
of the first edition
of <i>Hitler's War</i> in 1977,

53:22.074 --> 53:24.827
and the second edition in 1991,

53:24.911 --> 53:27.246
Mr. Irving's view
of the Holocaust

53:27.330 --> 53:29.790
underwent a sea change.

53:30.583 --> 53:33.127
In the 1977 version,

53:33.211 --> 53:37.798
he accepted it as historical
truth in all its essentials.

53:37.965 --> 53:41.093
But in the 1991 edition,

53:41.802 --> 53:45.598
all traces of the Holocaust
had disappeared.

53:47.516 --> 53:52.772
So, what are the reasons for
this astounding volte-face?

53:53.147 --> 53:55.775
Well, the principle reason
can be expressed

53:55.858 --> 53:59.070
in one word, Leuchter.

53:59.528 --> 54:00.529
Hmm.

54:00.613 --> 54:05.034
Now, according to Mr. Irving,
the Leuchter report is,

54:05.117 --> 54:06.911
"The biggest caliber shell

54:06.994 --> 54:10.122
"that has yet hit
the battleship Auschwitz."

54:10.456 --> 54:12.458
Unfortunately for Mr. Irving,

54:12.541 --> 54:16.504
the Leuchter report is bunk
and he knows it.

54:17.088 --> 54:18.923
So why did Mr. Irving

54:19.006 --> 54:22.593
embrace the Leuchter report
with such enthusiasm?

54:22.677 --> 54:24.804
Why did he choose
to publish it himself

54:24.887 --> 54:26.597
and even to write
an introduction?

54:27.848 --> 54:31.018
Well, the answer must be

54:31.102 --> 54:33.104
that he wanted it to be true.

54:34.021 --> 54:37.608
After all, if the Holocaust
hadn't happened,

54:37.692 --> 54:41.404
Hitler couldn't have
ordered it or known about it.

54:41.487 --> 54:42.947
And that's the point.

54:45.116 --> 54:47.368
Shh. Please.
Please, just...

54:47.451 --> 54:49.078
That was a very good start.

54:49.161 --> 54:50.371
Mmm, I'm glad you're happy.

54:50.454 --> 54:52.456
I saw his face when
you called him a liar.

54:52.540 --> 54:54.583
I don't think he's used
to hearing things like that.

54:54.667 --> 54:57.044
No, I don't think he is.
Excuse me. Miss Lipstadt?

54:57.128 --> 55:00.089
Yes, that's me.
May I speak to you?

55:00.172 --> 55:02.758
Yes. Um, could you give
us a minute, please?

55:05.428 --> 55:08.222
I would like you to come and
meet some of my friends.

55:08.764 --> 55:12.059
Friends with
something in common.

55:18.899 --> 55:20.026
Would you like to sit?

55:25.740 --> 55:28.576
We want to know, how can
you let this happen?

55:28.951 --> 55:31.412
None of us have been called.
We have to be heard.

55:32.705 --> 55:34.957
A trial of the Holocaust
and no witnesses?

55:35.041 --> 55:36.667
How can that be right?

55:37.960 --> 55:39.086
There is a whole group of us.

55:39.170 --> 55:41.797
Deborah, we have to testify.
We have to.

55:43.799 --> 55:47.178
On behalf of the others.
For the dead.

55:55.269 --> 55:56.771
I make you a promise.

56:01.901 --> 56:04.320
The voice of suffering
will be heard.

56:06.113 --> 56:08.115
I promise you that.

56:11.077 --> 56:12.370
I was looking
at Irving all the time.

56:12.453 --> 56:14.663
Yeah, me too.
Couldn't take my eyes off him.

56:14.747 --> 56:15.831
He is kind of riveting,
isn't he?

56:15.915 --> 56:17.708
Oh, I think this could
well become a ritual.

56:17.792 --> 56:20.544
A welcome one,
don't misunderstand me.

56:20.628 --> 56:23.714
Deborah? Not for me, thanks.

56:23.798 --> 56:26.926
You know, a very famous Attorney
General once told me a long time ago

56:27.009 --> 56:29.136
that one would become a much
more effective advocate...

56:29.220 --> 56:30.262
Can we talk privately?

56:30.346 --> 56:31.389
...after a few glasses of claret.

56:31.472 --> 56:35.351
And, of course, sandwiches.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.644
Ah!

56:36.727 --> 56:37.728
Bravo.

56:37.812 --> 56:38.813
They're always
in the cupboard.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.147
I have, uh,
cheese sandwiches...

56:40.398 --> 56:42.316
I just talked to a survivor.

56:43.692 --> 56:44.985
Yeah, well, that's likely.

56:45.069 --> 56:46.946
There's several
of them in the court.

56:48.864 --> 56:50.699
Deborah, we're not gonna
discuss this again.

56:50.783 --> 56:51.909
Why not?
I've explained to you.

56:51.992 --> 56:53.285
Well, tell me again, Anthony.

56:53.369 --> 56:55.538
Whatever you say,
the survivors are not on trial.

56:55.621 --> 56:56.622
That's the end of it.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.165
They confuse the issue.

56:58.499 --> 57:00.000
Oh, so you can look
a survivor in the face

57:00.084 --> 57:01.710
and you can tell her she's
not allowed to speak?

57:01.794 --> 57:03.838
You can do that? Because I can't.
I can't do it.

57:04.130 --> 57:06.090
Deborah, these people
have been through hell.

57:06.173 --> 57:07.341
I understand that.

57:07.675 --> 57:08.801
After all these years,

57:08.884 --> 57:10.553
they haven't been able
to process the experience.

57:10.636 --> 57:11.679
I understand that, too.

57:12.012 --> 57:15.015
But a trial, I'm afraid,
is not therapy.

57:15.558 --> 57:17.476
It's not my job to give
emotional satisfaction

57:17.560 --> 57:18.894
to a whole group of people

57:18.978 --> 57:20.771
who can never forget
what happened to them.

57:21.313 --> 57:24.525
You think they wanna
testify for themselves?

57:25.067 --> 57:28.028
It's not for themselves
they wanna testify.

57:28.863 --> 57:32.032
They wanna give voice to the
ones that didn't make it.

57:33.075 --> 57:35.786
To their families,
their friends.

57:38.456 --> 57:41.625
Anthony, I... I promised that
their voice would be heard.

57:41.709 --> 57:42.918
I promised.

57:44.545 --> 57:45.838
Well, then you'd better
go back out there

57:45.921 --> 57:47.465
and break your promise.

58:19.121 --> 58:20.623
Professor Van Pelt.

58:21.749 --> 58:24.502
May I first of all
welcome you to our country

58:24.585 --> 58:26.337
and say what a great
pleasure I had

58:26.420 --> 58:28.422
in reading your book
on Auschwitz.

58:29.256 --> 58:32.885
You were deeply moved to
visit the actual location?

58:32.968 --> 58:35.387
More than moved.
I was frightened.

58:35.471 --> 58:37.556
It's an awesome responsibility.

58:37.973 --> 58:39.183
Professor, would you agree

58:39.266 --> 58:41.852
it is the duty of historians

58:41.936 --> 58:44.772
to remain completely unemotional?

58:45.940 --> 58:47.858
One's duty is to be unemotional,

58:47.942 --> 58:49.610
to be objective,

58:49.860 --> 58:51.237
but one's duty, I think,

58:51.320 --> 58:53.948
is to remain human
in the exercise.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.786
Can you explain
to the court, please,

58:58.869 --> 59:02.581
why it is in the very earliest
references to Auschwitz,

59:02.998 --> 59:04.124
published by the Russians

59:04.208 --> 59:06.669
after the capture of the
camp in January 1945,

59:06.752 --> 59:08.254
there is no reference whatsoever

59:08.337 --> 59:10.965
to the discovery
of gas chambers?

59:11.131 --> 59:15.135
Uh, I would need to see the
documents you refer to.

59:15.636 --> 59:17.221
Well, that's fair, I think.

59:18.180 --> 59:19.807
It is fair, my Lord.

59:23.143 --> 59:25.563
Your report quotes extensively

59:25.646 --> 59:27.022
from firsthand testimony

59:27.106 --> 59:29.024
of a man called Tauber.

59:29.441 --> 59:32.570
Yes. Uh, Tauber was
a <i>Sonderkommando</i>

59:32.653 --> 59:34.280
in Crematorium ll.

59:34.488 --> 59:35.823
He helped with the prisoners.

59:35.906 --> 59:38.576
He was interrogated
at the end of May 1945.

59:38.659 --> 59:40.077
And, in his document,

59:40.452 --> 59:44.456
what does Tauber tell us about
the liquidation procedure?

59:45.583 --> 59:47.293
The... The simulation, please?

59:49.503 --> 59:53.841
What he describes is the underground
arrangement of the crematorium.

59:56.343 --> 59:58.596
The entrance was through
an undressing room.

59:58.679 --> 01:00:00.472
The prisoners went
into a corridor,

01:00:00.556 --> 01:00:02.308
and then through
a door on the right

01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.476
into the gas chamber.

01:00:04.852 --> 01:00:07.438
The door was
closed hermetically

01:00:07.521 --> 01:00:11.692
by means of iron bars
which were screwed tight.

01:00:13.235 --> 01:00:14.612
The roof of
the gas chamber

01:00:14.695 --> 01:00:18.282
was supported by concrete
columns and wire mesh pillars.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:19.617
Professor?

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.286
In your simulation,

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:25.205
that is the roof
in this big photograph here?

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:26.290
Uh, yes.

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:29.209
It is the self-same roof?

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:30.586
Yes.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.796
Uh, Tauber says
the sides of these pillars,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:34.423
which went up
through the roof,

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:38.052
were of heavy
wire mesh, like this.

01:00:40.596 --> 01:00:41.930
What does it mean
when it says that

01:00:42.014 --> 01:00:44.600
the pillars
went up through the roof?

01:00:44.933 --> 01:00:46.977
Went up to the roof, presumably?

01:00:47.061 --> 01:00:50.564
Yes, but they popped out,
uh, above the roof.

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:53.025
The pillars "popped out"?

01:00:53.108 --> 01:00:54.985
The pillars went
through a hole in the roof

01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:57.529
and the earth, which was
arranged on top of the roof,

01:00:57.613 --> 01:01:00.491
and then there was a little,
kind of, chimney on top of that.

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:01.992
What was the purpose of that,

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.369
architecturally speaking?

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:05.329
Because these
were hollow pillars

01:01:05.412 --> 01:01:06.705
and these were the pillars

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.666
in which the
crystals of Zyklon-B

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:10.751
were inserted into
the gas chamber.

01:01:12.503 --> 01:01:15.089
My Lord,
you can see the layout.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:17.591
You can see the pillars with

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:20.427
the wire mesh columns
next to them.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:22.304
You have drawn in

01:01:22.930 --> 01:01:25.391
those wire mesh columns,
have you not?

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.144
In the sketches
and on the computer?

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:31.397
One of my students did, yes.

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.774
But the wire mesh
is an addition,

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:35.859
it is not based on drawings

01:01:35.943 --> 01:01:37.444
and blueprints, is it?

01:01:37.778 --> 01:01:39.697
It is based on the
drawing made by the man

01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:41.490
who actually made these pillars.

01:01:41.573 --> 01:01:43.575
Michael Kula.
In the camp workshop.

01:01:43.659 --> 01:01:44.660
And this hole

01:01:44.993 --> 01:01:46.870
in the roof, or these holes,

01:01:46.954 --> 01:01:50.040
how many wire mesh columns
were there? Four?

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:53.043
Uh... One, two, three, four.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:58.799
Professor Pelt, we are wasting
our time, really, are we not?

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:03.053
You yourself have
stood on that roof

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:05.848
and looked for those holes
and not found them.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:09.184
Our experts have stood on
that roof and not found them.

01:02:09.268 --> 01:02:12.438
My Lord, there are no
holes in that roof.

01:02:12.521 --> 01:02:14.481
There never were any holes.

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:18.110
Therefore they cannot have poured
cyanide capsules through that roof.

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:19.445
You will appreciate,

01:02:19.528 --> 01:02:22.698
if there had been
those holes in that roof,

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:24.825
which are the cardinal linchpin
of the defense in this action,

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:27.327
they would have found them by now.
They have not found them!

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:29.913
And all the eyewitnesses
on whom he relies

01:02:29.997 --> 01:02:32.416
are therefore exposed
as the liars that they are.

01:02:36.712 --> 01:02:40.048
Uh, my Lord, it is now 3:56.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.926
Unless Mr. Rampton wishes to say

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:44.303
something to repair the damage...

01:02:44.386 --> 01:02:45.846
My Lord, may I respond to this?

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.974
You may.
But not until tomorrow.

01:02:49.725 --> 01:02:51.059
Court rise.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.396
Just walk.

01:02:54.521 --> 01:02:55.773
Say nothing. The trial took
an extraordinary turn...

01:02:55.856 --> 01:02:58.567
Why did Rampton drop it?
Why did he let it go?

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:00.110
Deborah, there are
journalists everywhere.

01:03:00.194 --> 01:03:02.237
Just look straight ahead
and keep walking, please.

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:04.406
Richard, can we get
some of your time, please?

01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:06.325
I don't have much time now.
It won't take long.

01:03:06.408 --> 01:03:08.660
We have an unhappy client.
Okay, yes.

01:03:09.411 --> 01:03:10.788
Deborah, this is disastrous.

01:03:10.871 --> 01:03:12.164
I'm sorry. I'm going to
have to take her. I know.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.290
I'm so sorry.

01:03:13.373 --> 01:03:14.666
...a major
setback for the defense

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:16.710
who are now at the bottom
of an uphill struggle.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.296
Let's all calm down, please.
Try not to panic.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.882
Irving pulled a rabbit
out of the hat at 3:55.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:23.884
He thinks it's clever.
It isn't clever.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:25.219
No, it's not clever.
It's amateur dramatics.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:26.470
It doesn't mean
it's not effective.

01:03:26.553 --> 01:03:27.805
Richard is gonna
deal with this tomorrow.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.264
Look at these, look at these.
Not that one.

01:03:29.348 --> 01:03:30.557
I've looked at them.
I've seen them.

01:03:30.599 --> 01:03:32.643
I know them. Look. Look.
Perfectly clear.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.854
The Olère drawings. The US
Air Force aerial photo.

01:03:35.938 --> 01:03:37.940
And there they are.
I know these photos.

01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:39.817
I don't need to look at them.
Holes in all of them, Deborah.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.027
Look, look, look.
Same shape, same pattern.

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:43.654
One, two, three, four.

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:45.197
One, two, three, four.

01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.115
And you know
what Irving is gonna say?

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:48.325
Irving's gonna say,
"They're not holes.

01:03:48.408 --> 01:03:49.660
"They're shadows, they're forgeries,

01:03:49.743 --> 01:03:50.828
"they're glitches on the negative,

01:03:50.911 --> 01:03:52.496
"they're paint cans on the roof."

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:54.289
Yes, and it's our job
to prove otherwise.

01:03:54.373 --> 01:03:56.124
But how are you gonna do that?
Anyway, it's too late.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:57.960
It's already out there.
It's in the press.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:03:59.837
Oh, it's in the press?
So what it's in the press?

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.672
So Irving got what he came for.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.715
You know, he wanted headlines,
he got 'em.

01:04:04.007 --> 01:04:05.342
"No holes, no Holocaust!"

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:06.927
He wanted a catchy phrase,
he's got it.

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.929
It's gonna... It's gonna
spread like a virus.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.013
Do you want tea?

01:04:10.097 --> 01:04:11.682
No, I don't want tea.
Just asking.

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.183
Don't you see
what he's doing?

01:04:13.267 --> 01:04:14.810
He's making it
respectable to say

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:16.144
that there are
two points of view.

01:04:16.854 --> 01:04:18.188
People are gonna
see the news now

01:04:18.272 --> 01:04:19.523
and they're gonna think,
"Oh, okay.

01:04:19.606 --> 01:04:21.692
"Some people think there were
gas chambers at Auschwitz,

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:24.027
"and, oh, this is interesting,
some people don't."

01:04:24.111 --> 01:04:26.655
Yes, but Deborah, you know why he
chose Auschwitz in the first place.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:28.657
Why he chose Auschwitz?
Because everybody heard of it.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.325
Because of its emotional impact.
No.

01:04:30.409 --> 01:04:32.494
Because. I don't know.
What are you getting at?

01:04:32.578 --> 01:04:34.454
No. Because it wasn't built
as an extermination camp.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:35.706
It was built as a labor camp.

01:04:35.789 --> 01:04:37.374
I know that.
Then it was modified.

01:04:37.457 --> 01:04:38.417
Yes, I know that.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:39.793
That's why he's going after it.

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:42.212
It's a battering ram into
a much bigger subject.

01:04:42.296 --> 01:04:44.756
Auschwitz is at the very
center of Holocaust belief,

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.342
so Auschwitz is at the very
center of Holocaust denial.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:48.969
Think about it logically.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.221
It doesn't make any sense
at all what he says.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:52.639
"No holes, no Holocaust."

01:04:52.723 --> 01:04:54.391
He seizes one tiny fact

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:56.351
and because that can't be
physically proved, he says,

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:58.228
"Oh, well, then that throws
everything into doubt.

01:04:58.312 --> 01:04:59.438
"The Nazis didn't
do any murdering.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:00.564
"They didn't do
any murdering at all."

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.774
I know that. I wrote
a whole book about it.

01:05:02.858 --> 01:05:03.901
For God's sake...
I know that.

01:05:03.984 --> 01:05:05.444
It's the same
thing as the Hitler trick.

01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:06.862
It's exactly the same thing.
Exactly the same thing!

01:05:06.945 --> 01:05:08.071
"Give them $1,000."

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.115
Tell me about it.
I'm the one that he did it to.

01:05:10.198 --> 01:05:11.533
You know, if you can't
find a piece of paper

01:05:11.617 --> 01:05:13.076
where it says, you know,

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:14.536
"Please murder the Jews,"

01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:16.747
it means Hitler never wanted
them to die in the first place.

01:05:16.914 --> 01:05:18.540
"Hitler was the Jews' best friend."

01:05:18.624 --> 01:05:20.834
Irving said that!
He actually said that!

01:05:20.918 --> 01:05:21.919
I have to go.

01:05:22.002 --> 01:05:23.295
Wait a minute!
I wanna say something.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:24.922
And for once I want you
all to listen to me.

01:05:25.005 --> 01:05:26.006
I'm the defendant

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.090
and I know the rule.

01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:28.759
The rule is
the client instructs.

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:30.552
Well, the client's instructing.

01:05:30.928 --> 01:05:34.348
The survivors go on the stand.
And I go on the stand, too.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:36.350
Gentlemen.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:40.395
Richard? Where's he going?
Richard?

01:05:40.479 --> 01:05:42.022
Did you hear what I just said?
Deborah!

01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:45.525
Richard. Richard.

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.445
Why is he leaving?
Because he has to prepare.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:49.529
That's why he's leaving.

01:05:49.613 --> 01:05:50.948
He doesn't just turn up in court.

01:05:51.031 --> 01:05:53.116
He devotes his entire day,
every minute of his day,

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.661
rigorously, to this case and nothing but.
And that's the point!

01:05:55.744 --> 01:05:59.039
No, what you're not getting,
what you're ignoring,

01:05:59.122 --> 01:06:00.916
is that we know what
happened at Auschwitz

01:06:00.999 --> 01:06:02.918
because there were people
there who actually saw it.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:05.545
Oh, Deborah, Deborah.
Yes, yes!

01:06:05.629 --> 01:06:07.464
With their own eyes.

01:06:07.547 --> 01:06:08.757
They're called survivors.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.467
Yes. And put survivors on the stand

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:12.386
and Irving will humiliate them.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.930
Remember the Zündel trial.
Remember the <i>Exodus</i> trial.

01:06:15.013 --> 01:06:16.431
They were torn apart.

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:19.559
Because survivors don't remember.

01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:21.186
Not every detail.
They forget something.

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.355
They say a door was on the left,
when actually it was on the right,

01:06:23.438 --> 01:06:24.690
and then, Wham! Irving's in.

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.775
You see? "They're liars,
you can't trust anything they say."

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:28.068
That's it, that's the technique.

01:06:28.402 --> 01:06:30.487
<i>...will roll up her sleeve
and show you the tattoo</i>

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:32.322
<i>to prove that, yes,
she was in Auschwitz.</i>

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:34.032
Do you think
Irving's gonna respect them?

01:06:34.116 --> 01:06:36.326
You want that? Holocaust
survivors mocked and humiliated?

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:38.161
<i>You've got to get tasteless.</i>

01:06:38.245 --> 01:06:39.287
<i>I shall say,</i>

01:06:39.371 --> 01:06:42.457
<i>"Mrs. Altman, how much money</i>

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:45.460
<i>"have you made out of
that tattoo since 1945?"</i>

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:52.217
You want more of that, do you?

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:55.303
You think that's helpful?

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.853
So, now, Mr. Irving,

01:08:28.229 --> 01:08:30.607
I will ask you to explain why,

01:08:31.441 --> 01:08:34.861
if, as you claim, there were
no gas chambers in Auschwitz,

01:08:35.237 --> 01:08:40.783
the gratings taken in 1945
by the Polish authorities

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.870
from Morgue 1 in Crematorium ll
were covered in cyanide,

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:48.625
and why the camp's chief architect,
Karl Bischoff,

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.502
specifically refers to Morgue 1

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:53.462
as a <i>Vergasungskeller,</i>

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:55.590
a "gassing cellar."

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:58.551
Well?

01:09:00.053 --> 01:09:02.721
I am willing to concede
that they did indeed find

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:06.184
in the ventilator gratings
traces of cyanide.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.935
They did?
Yes.

01:09:08.937 --> 01:09:10.772
I will also concede
that it was indeed

01:09:10.856 --> 01:09:12.399
used as a gassing cellar.

01:09:12.649 --> 01:09:14.317
It was?
Yes.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:15.569
Good. So...

01:09:16.903 --> 01:09:18.279
Gassing what?

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.532
Well, I think
the evidence is clear

01:09:21.241 --> 01:09:24.202
that the room was used
as a gassing cellar

01:09:24.286 --> 01:09:26.287
for fumigating cadavers.

01:09:28.582 --> 01:09:30.625
Fumigating cadavers?
Yes.

01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.752
Why exactly do you say that?

01:09:33.879 --> 01:09:35.796
That is what mortuaries are for.

01:09:35.881 --> 01:09:38.175
In mortuaries you put cadavers.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.385
What is the evidence
that that room

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.554
was used for gassing corpses?

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:44.514
That is what it was built for.

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:46.515
I'm sorry, this, uh,

01:09:47.475 --> 01:09:48.977
seems a crude question,

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.520
but what is the point
of gassing a corpse?

01:09:52.272 --> 01:09:53.732
Because, my Lord,

01:09:53.814 --> 01:09:55.859
they came in heavily infested

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.695
with the typhus-bearing
lice which had killed them.

01:09:58.778 --> 01:09:59.946
Did they?

01:10:00.614 --> 01:10:03.325
Did they, Mr. Irving?
Did they indeed?

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.118
Then please explain to me

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.495
why they needed
a gas-proof door

01:10:07.579 --> 01:10:09.998
with a peep hole
with double 8mm glass

01:10:10.081 --> 01:10:12.792
and a metal grill
on the inside?

01:10:23.637 --> 01:10:25.513
You will remember
at this time

01:10:25.597 --> 01:10:27.265
most of Germany
was under the weight

01:10:27.349 --> 01:10:28.725
of Royal Air Force
bomber command.

01:10:30.727 --> 01:10:32.062
There was a concern
about the need

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.480
to build bomb-tight shelters.

01:10:33.563 --> 01:10:35.732
So now it's an air-raid shelter,
is it?

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:37.025
I beg your pardon?

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:40.820
It is either a room for
gassing already dead corpses,

01:10:41.154 --> 01:10:42.656
or it's an air-raid shelter?

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.658
Did I say either/or?

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.494
In early 1943?

01:10:48.328 --> 01:10:49.663
An air-raid shelter?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.414
When you know
perfectly well that

01:10:51.498 --> 01:10:53.250
the first bombing
raid near Auschwitz

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.835
wasn't until late 1944.

01:10:56.503 --> 01:10:58.046
And the placing

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:01.800
of this so-called
"air-raid shelter,"

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:02.884
if it was for the SS,

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:05.845
it was a terribly long way from
the SS barracks, wasn't it?

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.764
Have you thought of that?

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:10.183
It's two and a half miles,
isn't it?

01:11:12.102 --> 01:11:13.228
If there was a bombing raid,

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.230
they'd all be dead
before they got there.

01:11:15.689 --> 01:11:20.068
But can you really see lots
of very heavily armed men

01:11:20.151 --> 01:11:22.570
running the two and a
half to three miles

01:11:22.654 --> 01:11:24.948
from the SS barracks to a cellar

01:11:25.198 --> 01:11:27.158
at the far end of Birkenau?

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:29.244
You see...

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:32.706
I'm trying to understand

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:36.710
if there was this,
this dual function,

01:11:36.793 --> 01:11:38.628
so see if you can help me.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:40.213
Now, if the corpses

01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:42.799
were also gassed there,

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:44.426
then, as I understand it,

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:47.470
they were then
sent to be incinerated?

01:11:47.554 --> 01:11:48.638
Yes.

01:11:49.389 --> 01:11:52.392
What is the point
in gassing a corpse

01:11:52.475 --> 01:11:54.394
that is about to be burnt?

01:11:58.356 --> 01:11:59.733
I'm not sure, saying this

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.735
off the top of my head, Mr. Rampton.

01:12:02.235 --> 01:12:04.279
I'm not a Holocaust historian,

01:12:04.362 --> 01:12:06.781
I'm a Hitler historian.

01:12:06.865 --> 01:12:10.076
Then why don't you keep your
mouth shut about the Holocaust?

01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:13.496
The truth is, as usual, Mr. Irving,

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:14.706
you jump in off the board

01:12:14.789 --> 01:12:16.666
spouting whatever rubbish
comes into your head

01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:19.419
in order to avoid
the obvious conclusion.

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:22.130
This is not because
you're a rotten historian.

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:25.759
It's because you're
a bent one, as well.

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:11.930
Come in!

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.109
Um, forgive me.
I should have rung,

01:13:24.192 --> 01:13:25.777
but I thought
it would be interesting

01:13:25.860 --> 01:13:27.404
to see where you lived.

01:13:28.238 --> 01:13:31.366
Is that all right?
Yes, of course.

01:13:31.825 --> 01:13:33.201
Come in, please.
Thank you. Thank you.

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.703
It's, uh, very messy.

01:13:35.787 --> 01:13:37.831
Well, that's not
going to bother me.

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:42.419
Let's see, the, um,
1995 Pommard les Epenots.

01:13:43.503 --> 01:13:44.921
Uh, it's rather special,
I think.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:46.381
You've had it before, remember?

01:13:46.464 --> 01:13:48.049
Oh, uh, yes.

01:13:49.259 --> 01:13:51.845
Well, there are glasses here.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.097
Ah, shame.
I rather like plastic.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:56.433
Still, you can't have everything.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:02.397
I like to treat myself,
don't you?

01:14:03.106 --> 01:14:04.315
Why should
all the bad people

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.359
have all the good
things in life?

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:07.610
Like this?

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.906
You had a good morning. Yes, I did.
I did, didn't I?

01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:13.950
I rather think
it went my way.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.493
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:14:15.577 --> 01:14:16.786
Mmm.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:19.831
It's paying off.
What is?

01:14:20.540 --> 01:14:22.292
Your technique.
That thing you do.

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.710
You never catch his eye.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.462
Ah! You've noticed, have you?

01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:27.297
Well, what do you think
I've been doing these...

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.965
These past weeks?

01:14:29.048 --> 01:14:30.049
Please, uh...

01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:32.385
Sit.
Oh, thank you.

01:14:32.552 --> 01:14:34.888
Yes, well, it's my way of

01:14:35.430 --> 01:14:36.473
telling him what I think of him.

01:14:36.556 --> 01:14:38.933
I don't look at him.
It's getting under his skin.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.193
I owe you an apology.

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.695
I can't think why.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:53.072
For Auschwitz.
Oh.

01:14:55.074 --> 01:14:56.409
I thought you were rude.

01:14:57.118 --> 01:14:58.703
I thought you were late.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:00.580
But now I understand.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.332
You were just... You were
pacing out the distance.

01:15:02.415 --> 01:15:03.666
Yes.
Yes, I had to.

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:06.002
Well, I understand
that from today.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:10.173
Yes, it's a scene of a crime.
I have to go to the site.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:12.967
You were preparing a case.
You had to be sure.

01:15:13.051 --> 01:15:15.345
However disrespectful you seemed.

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.680
However heartless.

01:15:20.433 --> 01:15:22.101
That's what I do.

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:27.315
I didn't know what to expect.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.985
It was. ..
It was a brief.

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:33.404
I mean, my previous brief,
believe it or not,

01:15:33.488 --> 01:15:34.906
was from McDonald's.

01:15:37.534 --> 01:15:41.746
How could Auschwitz be
just another brief?

01:15:42.705 --> 01:15:44.082
I am sorry that

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:48.336
perhaps you felt that
that's what it was to me.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.676
Very upsetting to see a
client in such distress.

01:15:55.343 --> 01:15:57.136
We didn't mean to
make you unhappy.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.555
I know that.

01:16:00.515 --> 01:16:02.225
But I have never
trusted anyone

01:16:02.308 --> 01:16:03.560
to do anything on my behalf

01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:05.395
since I was a child.

01:16:06.813 --> 01:16:10.233
And all I have is my
voice and my conscience

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.236
and I have to listen to it.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:14.487
Your conscience?
Yes!

01:16:14.571 --> 01:16:15.697
Yes.

01:16:16.864 --> 01:16:19.242
They're strange things, consciences.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:21.744
Trouble is, what feels best

01:16:23.121 --> 01:16:25.623
isn't necessarily
what works best.

01:16:26.666 --> 01:16:28.501
I mean, by all means,

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:30.169
stand up, look the
devil in the eye,

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:32.964
tell him what you feel.

01:16:33.673 --> 01:16:36.259
Why not? It's very satisfying.
See what happens.

01:16:37.969 --> 01:16:39.554
And risk losing.

01:16:41.222 --> 01:16:42.849
Not just for yourself.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.434
For the others.

01:16:44.517 --> 01:16:47.437
For everyone.
Forever.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.772
Or?

01:16:49.856 --> 01:16:53.067
Or...
You know "or."

01:16:54.152 --> 01:16:55.695
Stay seated.

01:16:57.488 --> 01:16:58.615
Button your lip.

01:17:00.491 --> 01:17:01.826
Win.

01:17:04.287 --> 01:17:06.623
An act of self-denial.

01:17:16.716 --> 01:17:18.384
Do you have any
idea how hard it is

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:21.387
to hand over your conscience
to somebody else?

01:17:24.641 --> 01:17:27.560
This is everything I
thought I would never do.

01:17:33.066 --> 01:17:34.651
All right.

01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:41.240
I'm gonna hand mine over
to this, uh, fly-fishing,

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:44.452
wine-drinking

01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:45.536
Scotsman.

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.680
There you are.
Hello.

01:18:03.805 --> 01:18:06.349
Morning.
Here, let me move this.

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:07.600
Sit down.

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:10.103
What is that?

01:18:10.436 --> 01:18:12.689
Ah.
It's black pudding.

01:18:12.772 --> 01:18:13.773
It's traditional.

01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:15.441
It's made of blood.

01:18:15.525 --> 01:18:17.318
And you wanna live until
the end of the trial?

01:18:17.402 --> 01:18:19.654
Well, you've cheered
up since last night.

01:18:19.779 --> 01:18:21.781
I've cheered up
because of last night.

01:18:22.115 --> 01:18:23.449
Shutting up's not
gonna be easy but...

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:24.867
Oh, could I have
a black pudding

01:18:24.951 --> 01:18:25.910
for my friend, please?

01:18:25.993 --> 01:18:28.371
Ignore him.
I want a bagel, please.

01:18:28.454 --> 01:18:31.124
Oh, and not toasted.
Thanks.

01:18:31.457 --> 01:18:33.584
Oh, I need this.
It's gonna be a tough day.

01:18:33.668 --> 01:18:34.836
Proving intention.

01:18:35.586 --> 01:18:38.047
Richard Evans
gave us plenty of places

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:39.674
where Irving got
his facts wrong.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:42.427
But we have to prove he got
'em wrong intentionally.

01:18:43.136 --> 01:18:44.846
He's fighting for his life.

01:18:44.929 --> 01:18:46.347
And remember,

01:18:46.681 --> 01:18:48.307
he knows the law
as well as we do.

01:18:48.391 --> 01:18:51.644
Unless we prove that Irving's
mistakes are deliberate,

01:18:51.728 --> 01:18:52.937
we lose.

01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:54.689
We lose.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:57.275
<i>Mr. Irving,</i>

01:18:58.526 --> 01:18:59.736
the defense are claiming that

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:01.779
you deliberately falsified evidence

01:19:01.863 --> 01:19:03.865
to suit your own political purposes.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:06.159
You must address that charge.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:11.330
We must deal with what we
call <i>"keine liquidierung."</i>

01:19:12.165 --> 01:19:15.376
Very well. We're looking first
at the November 30th entry.

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:16.669
Am I right?

01:19:16.753 --> 01:19:17.879
My Lord,

01:19:17.962 --> 01:19:19.672
if I may explain the context?

01:19:19.756 --> 01:19:21.007
Please.

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:24.302
Heinrich Himmler,
the Head of the SS, kept a log

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:26.554
in which he made a record
of every telephone call

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:28.556
he gave and received.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.183
In 1941,

01:19:30.558 --> 01:19:32.894
he called Heydrich
from Hitler's bunker

01:19:32.977 --> 01:19:34.729
to give him instructions.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:37.607
After the call,
he wrote some words.

01:19:37.690 --> 01:19:41.319
<i>"Jodentransport aus Berlin.</i>

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.070
<i>"Keine Liquidierung.</i>

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:45.448
<i>"Jodentransport aus Berlin.
Keine Liquidierung."</i>

01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:46.824
Which clearly means,

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:50.203
"The Jew Transport from Berlin.

01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:52.163
"No liquidation."

01:19:52.246 --> 01:19:55.583
"The Jew Transport," singular,

01:19:56.292 --> 01:19:57.376
"from Berlin."

01:19:58.795 --> 01:20:00.129
In <i>Hitler's War,</i>

01:20:00.213 --> 01:20:02.632
you write something
completely different.

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:06.010
"At 01:30, Himmler was obliged

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:09.639
"to telephone from Hitler's
bunker to Heydrich

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:14.143
"the explicit order that Jews
were not to be liquidated."

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:17.438
In other words,
you mistranslate the log

01:20:17.855 --> 01:20:19.982
so as to pretend that
this order came directly

01:20:20.066 --> 01:20:21.317
from Hitler, which it didn't,

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:22.944
they hadn't even met that day,

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:24.904
and that it applied

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:28.407
not to just one particular
trainload of Jews,

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:31.327
but to all Jews
throughout Germany.

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:34.413
And in order to bolster

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:36.749
this false impression,

01:20:36.833 --> 01:20:39.794
you omit the word
"Berlin" altogether.

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:42.046
So your claim to have

01:20:42.129 --> 01:20:46.717
incontrovertible proof that Hitler tried
to stop the liquidation of the Jews,

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:51.138
as opposed to one particular
trainload of Jews, is false.

01:20:51.597 --> 01:20:54.559
You knew that then. You know it now.
It's wrong.

01:20:57.186 --> 01:20:59.021
Of course,
if you privately decided

01:20:59.105 --> 01:21:01.065
it was a...

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.985
A reasonable kind
of mistake to make

01:21:04.527 --> 01:21:07.530
when one is reading a new
document for the first time,

01:21:07.613 --> 01:21:11.158
you would, uh, you would immediately
tell the court, would you not?

01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:12.493
Of course, I would.

01:21:13.119 --> 01:21:17.582
I do not feel this is a
reasonable mistake to make.

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:19.834
I believe it's deliberate.

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:21.085
Ha!

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:28.384
<i>In</i> Hitler's War,

01:21:28.467 --> 01:21:30.678
<i>you write something

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:34.390
<i>"At 01:30, Himmler was obliged</i>

bunker to Heydrich</i>

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:42.815
<i>"the explicit order that Jews
were not to be liquidated."</i>

01:21:42.899 --> 01:21:46.193
What? Because I'm tired of it.

01:21:47.236 --> 01:21:49.322
You didn't even
want to be a lawyer.

01:21:52.742 --> 01:21:54.410
The Holocaust, the Holocaust.

01:21:56.495 --> 01:21:58.456
There are other things.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:02.251
At some point isn't everyone
gonna have to let go?

01:22:03.836 --> 01:22:05.671
It... It's an obsession.

01:22:06.297 --> 01:22:07.840
How many years?

01:22:08.841 --> 01:22:11.385
Are they ever gonna
let go of this grievance?

01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:14.180
I think it's rather
more than a grievance.

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:16.307
<i>I find the whole</i>

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:18.434
<i>Holocaust story utterly boring.</i>

01:22:20.019 --> 01:22:22.063
<i>The Jews keep going on
about the Holocaust</i>

01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:23.898
<i>because it's the only
interesting thing</i>

01:22:23.981 --> 01:22:26.359
<i>which has happened to them
in 3,000 years.</i>

01:22:26.442 --> 01:22:29.153
<i>I'm not
interested in the Holocaust,</i>

01:22:29.236 --> 01:22:31.280
<i>I don't know anyone who is.</i>

01:22:32.490 --> 01:22:33.616
And that's an excerpt

01:22:33.699 --> 01:22:35.409
from a speech you made

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:38.454
at the Best Western Hotel in Tampa

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:42.041
on July the 25th, 1998.

01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:43.334
I remember speaking,

01:22:43.417 --> 01:22:45.252
um, I do not know
what the date was.

01:22:45.586 --> 01:22:49.882
You said, "I think 95%
of the thinking public

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.301
"find the Holocaust
endlessly boring,

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.095
"but they dare not say it

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:57.264
"because it is
politically incorrect."

01:22:58.224 --> 01:23:00.476
Uh, Mr. Irving,
next I want to refer you

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.729
to a talk you gave
to the Clarendon Club,

01:23:03.813 --> 01:23:05.398
whatever that may be,

01:23:05.481 --> 01:23:08.818
on the 19th of September, 1992.

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:14.115
Uh, the transcripts.
Tab five, my Lord, page 35.

01:23:14.198 --> 01:23:15.241
Thank you.

01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:17.910
<i>But if there is
one thing that gets up my nose,</i>

01:23:17.994 --> 01:23:20.079
<i>I must admit it's this.</i>

01:23:20.413 --> 01:23:22.289
<i>When I switch on
my television set</i>

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:24.583
<i>and I see one of them
reading our news to us.</i>

01:23:27.336 --> 01:23:31.007
Mr. Irving, who is the
"them" and who is the "us"?

01:23:31.966 --> 01:23:33.009
Trevor McDonald.

01:23:33.259 --> 01:23:34.510
McDonald?

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:36.345
A newsreader, my Lord.

01:23:36.804 --> 01:23:38.431
A black newsreader.

01:23:39.015 --> 01:23:42.018
Well, in fact, this is
a stock speech I used to make.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:43.686
I used to say,

01:23:43.769 --> 01:23:44.854
"In the good old days,

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:46.939
"the announcer would
wear a dinner jacket.

01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:48.566
"Now they've got
women reading the news,

01:23:48.649 --> 01:23:49.650
"and they have..."

01:23:49.734 --> 01:23:51.444
It's just part of
a general speech.

01:23:51.944 --> 01:23:55.406
Yes. "It is our news and
they're reading it to me."

01:23:56.407 --> 01:23:58.367
<i>If they could have their own news,
which they were reading to us,</i>

01:23:58.451 --> 01:23:59.660
<i>I suppose it would be
very interesting.</i>

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.204
<i>But for the time being,</i>

01:24:02.288 --> 01:24:04.498
<i>I'd be prepared
to accept that the BBC</i>

01:24:04.582 --> 01:24:06.959
<i>should have a
dinner-jacketed gentleman</i>

01:24:07.043 --> 01:24:08.461
<i>reading the important news...</i>

01:24:08.544 --> 01:24:11.630
<i>...followed by a lady reading
the less important news...</i>

01:24:11.714 --> 01:24:14.008
<i>...followed by Trevor McDonald
giving us all the latest news</i>

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:15.551
<i>on muggings and drug busts.</i>

01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:19.847
"Rest lost in
loud laughter and applause."

01:24:21.182 --> 01:24:22.975
Are you not appalled by that?

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:24.810
Not in the least.

01:24:25.186 --> 01:24:26.270
This was a witty speech

01:24:26.353 --> 01:24:28.731
delivered after dinner to an
audience at a private club.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:30.524
You were talking to
a bunch of racists.

01:24:30.608 --> 01:24:32.943
No, they were not. They were
perfectly ordinary guests...

01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:35.237
Ordinary people?
Then why were there cheers?

01:24:35.321 --> 01:24:37.364
Well, obviously they liked the jokes.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.829
Mr. Irving, I think
you might be advised

01:24:43.913 --> 01:24:45.873
to have a look
at your own diary,

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.917
if you wouldn't mind.

01:24:48.167 --> 01:24:50.586
Thirty-eight, please,
Mr. Irving, 38.

01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:52.129
Tab 10

01:24:52.671 --> 01:24:55.091
of the bundle K4.

01:24:59.053 --> 01:25:01.931
"A quiet evening at home.
Jessica..."

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.015
Who is Jessica?

01:25:04.350 --> 01:25:06.352
My little infant child.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.520
Yes.

01:25:07.603 --> 01:25:10.356
She was nine months
old at the time.

01:25:10.564 --> 01:25:13.818
Nine months old
in September 1994.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:19.073
"Jessica is turning into
a fine little lady.

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:23.119
"She sits very upright
on an ordinary chair,

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:26.539
"a product of our regular
walks to the bank, I am sure.

01:25:27.081 --> 01:25:31.168
"On those walks, we sing the
'binkety-bankety-bong' song.

01:25:31.836 --> 01:25:33.963
"She stars in a poem

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:37.049
"when half-breed children
are wheeled past."

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:42.054
And then you go into italics.

01:25:43.806 --> 01:25:45.724
<i>"I am a baby Aryan</i>

01:25:46.225 --> 01:25:48.561
<i>"Not Jewish or sectarian</i>

01:25:49.186 --> 01:25:51.772
<i>"I have no plans to marry</i>

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:54.316
<i>"An ape or Rastafarian."</i>

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.320
Racist, Mr. Irving?

01:25:58.737 --> 01:26:00.531
Anti-Semitic, Mr. Irving?

01:26:00.739 --> 01:26:02.116
I do not think so.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:05.786
Teaching your little
child this kind of poison?

01:26:06.579 --> 01:26:08.747
Do you think a nine-month-old
can understand words

01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:10.708
spoken in English
or any other language?

01:26:10.791 --> 01:26:12.710
This poor little child

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:15.254
has been taught
a racist ditty

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.882
by her racist
and perverted father.

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:20.259
Have you ever read Edward Lear?

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:21.886
Hilaire Belloc?

01:26:21.969 --> 01:26:25.222
They haven't brought a libel action,
Mr. Irving. You have.

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:28.475
You sued because you said that

01:26:28.559 --> 01:26:31.729
we had called you a racist
and an extremist.

01:26:32.771 --> 01:26:34.064
Yes,

01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:37.401
but I'm not a racist.

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:41.822
Mr. Irving,

01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:46.160
look at the words on the page.

01:26:51.749 --> 01:26:53.250
Well done, Richard.

01:26:53.334 --> 01:26:55.544
That's it.
Racism, anti-Semitism

01:26:55.628 --> 01:26:57.046
and the guy's
a Holocaust denier.

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:59.256
I mean, we always said
it was a package deal.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.259
We've got symptoms,
purpose, motive.

01:27:02.343 --> 01:27:04.887
I really don't see
what else they'd want.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.388
What did you think, Anthony?

01:27:06.472 --> 01:27:07.431
What did I think?

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.391
I thought it was
the most boring morning

01:27:09.475 --> 01:27:10.559
we've had in court so far.

01:27:10.643 --> 01:27:12.603
My God, you love to be contrary.

01:27:12.686 --> 01:27:14.897
Well, the man's an
anti-Semite and a racist.

01:27:14.980 --> 01:27:16.315
It's like having
shit on your shoe.

01:27:16.398 --> 01:27:18.192
You wipe it off.
You don't study it.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:19.235
Thanks a lot.

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:20.736
You know, my whole
life's been studying it.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:23.948
You could hardly accuse
me of being racist.

01:27:24.031 --> 01:27:25.157
Among my domestic staff

01:27:25.241 --> 01:27:27.243
I've had a Barbadian, a Punjabi,

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:29.078
Sri Lankan, a Pakistani.

01:27:29.161 --> 01:27:31.247
And I can tell you, though, they
were all very attractive girls

01:27:31.330 --> 01:27:32.498
with very nice breasts.

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:34.500
I'm sorry?
Can you say that again?

01:27:36.752 --> 01:27:37.795
<i>You know what I'm gonna miss?</i>

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.797
I'm gonna miss these lunches.
Ah.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:41.382
Me, too, Richard.
Me, too.

01:27:41.465 --> 01:27:42.424
Me, too.

01:27:42.508 --> 01:27:43.842
The excellent chutney.

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:46.345
It's something I never expected.

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:47.846
My parents made me
take up law

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:49.682
and the first case I get,

01:27:49.765 --> 01:27:51.183
I feel I'm making a difference.

01:27:51.267 --> 01:27:53.310
It's a wonderful feeling.

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.062
I never ever expected that.

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:58.857
I feel exactly the same...
Still.

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:01.819
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:06.156
All right, who wants any more
of this excellent vintage?

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:07.700
Yes, please.
Oh, no, not for me.

01:28:08.534 --> 01:28:11.870
This trial has been both
long and hugely expensive,

01:28:11.954 --> 01:28:14.873
costing an estimated three
million pounds or more

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:17.001
and running for
almost eight weeks.

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:18.460
As the trial enters
its eighth week,

01:28:18.544 --> 01:28:20.754
some are saying it raises
freedom-of-speech issues.

01:28:20.838 --> 01:28:22.214
Only the two opposing
speeches remain

01:28:22.298 --> 01:28:24.133
before the judge,
Mr. Justice Gray,

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:26.802
retires for what we are told
will be at least four weeks

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:28.387
to consider his judgment.

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:31.974
My Lord, during this trial

01:28:32.057 --> 01:28:34.143
we have heard from
Professor Evans and others

01:28:34.226 --> 01:28:35.769
of at least 25

01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:38.063
major falsifications of history.

01:28:39.106 --> 01:28:40.774
"Well," says Mr. Irving,

01:28:41.150 --> 01:28:43.652
"all historians make mistakes."

01:28:44.278 --> 01:28:45.487
But there is a difference

01:28:45.571 --> 01:28:47.364
between negligence,

01:28:47.448 --> 01:28:49.241
which is random in its effect,

01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:53.537
and a deliberateness
which is far more one-sided.

01:28:54.204 --> 01:28:56.498
All Mr. Irving's little fictions,

01:28:56.582 --> 01:28:59.084
all his tweaks of the evidence,

01:28:59.168 --> 01:29:00.836
all tend in the same direction,

01:29:00.919 --> 01:29:04.757
the exculpation of Adolf Hitler.

01:29:05.090 --> 01:29:07.051
He is, to use an analogy,
like the waiter

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:09.303
who always gives
the wrong change.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:11.055
If he is honest,

01:29:11.138 --> 01:29:12.681
we may expect sometimes

01:29:12.765 --> 01:29:14.725
his mistakes to
favor the customers,

01:29:14.808 --> 01:29:16.477
sometimes himself.

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:20.939
But Mr. Irving is
the dishonest waiter.

01:29:21.774 --> 01:29:24.276
All his mistakes
work in his favor.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:28.447
How far, if at all,
Mr. Irving's anti-Semitism

01:29:28.530 --> 01:29:31.367
is the cause
of his Hitler apology,

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:34.703
or vice versa, is unimportant.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:38.707
Whether they are taken
together or individually

01:29:38.791 --> 01:29:40.542
it is clear that
they have led him

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:41.877
to prostitute his reputation

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.296
as a serious historian

01:29:44.505 --> 01:29:48.258
in favor of a bogus
rehabilitation of Adolf Hitler

01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:49.885
and the dissemination

01:29:49.968 --> 01:29:54.014
of virulent anti-Semitic propaganda.

01:29:55.641 --> 01:29:57.393
Yes, this is a question

01:29:57.476 --> 01:30:00.062
I have to ask you,
Mr. Rampton.

01:30:00.145 --> 01:30:01.438
Yes, by all means, my Lord.

01:30:02.231 --> 01:30:03.774
My question is this,

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:06.985
if somebody is anti-Semitic,

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:09.571
anti-Semitic and extremist,

01:30:09.947 --> 01:30:11.198
he is perfectly capable

01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:15.452
of being honestly anti-Semitic, yes?

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:19.415
He's holding those views
and expressing those views

01:30:19.498 --> 01:30:21.708
because they are
indeed his views?

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:24.545
Well, yes.

01:30:25.003 --> 01:30:28.590
And so it seems to me,
if it comes down to it,

01:30:29.883 --> 01:30:31.760
that the anti-Semitism

01:30:31.844 --> 01:30:33.929
is a completely separate allegation

01:30:34.179 --> 01:30:36.765
and has precious little bearing
on your broader charge

01:30:36.849 --> 01:30:38.892
that he has
manipulated the data?

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:41.228
No, no, my Lord. No.

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:43.230
The whole endeavor
of the defense

01:30:43.313 --> 01:30:45.232
has been to prove
that the two are connected.

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:48.068
But he might believe
what he is saying.

01:30:49.027 --> 01:30:49.987
That is the point.

01:30:50.070 --> 01:30:51.864
That is why
it is so important.

01:30:53.407 --> 01:30:56.785
My Lord, if we know that
Mr. Irving is an anti-Semite,

01:30:56.869 --> 01:30:59.371
and if we know there is
no historical justification

01:30:59.455 --> 01:31:00.747
for Holocaust denial,

01:31:00.831 --> 01:31:04.293
then surely
it is no great stretch

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:06.211
to see that
the two are connected.

01:31:13.886 --> 01:31:17.181
Yes. Thank you.

01:31:18.223 --> 01:31:19.558
Carry on.

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.147
What the fuck just happened?

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:31.195
Anthony, what just happened?

01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:00.766
<i>Well? How was it?</i>

01:32:03.602 --> 01:32:05.771
<i>I'll tell you what
happened at the end.</i>

01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:10.234
We summed up.
Irving summed up.

01:32:14.112 --> 01:32:15.113
And?

01:32:15.197 --> 01:32:16.490
And everyone kept saying,
this is all great,

01:32:16.573 --> 01:32:19.910
<i>everything's gonna be fine.
And then suddenly this judge,</i>

01:32:19.993 --> 01:32:23.038
<i>this unbelievable character
from</i> Masterpiece Theatre...

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.165
Oh, I like <i>Masterpiece Theatre.</i>
I know.

01:32:25.249 --> 01:32:27.376
Anyway, at the last minute,
he looked up and he said,

01:32:27.459 --> 01:32:30.879
"Well, you know, maybe
Irving actually believes it.

01:32:30.963 --> 01:32:33.549
"He's an anti-Semite
and he believes it.

01:32:33.632 --> 01:32:35.050
"You can't accuse
someone of lying

01:32:35.133 --> 01:32:37.553
"if they genuinely believe
what they're saying."

01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:39.846
That's crazy.
That's insane.

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.974
And that's when I thought,
"I've been suckered."

01:32:42.307 --> 01:32:44.017
<i>I stared at this judge
for eight weeks</i>

01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:45.394
<i>and I thought
I was looking at wisdom,</i>

01:32:45.477 --> 01:32:48.146
<i>but maybe I was just
looking at prejudice.</i>

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:53.986
Well, what can you do?

01:32:54.486 --> 01:32:57.155
I just wait.
Just wait.

01:33:06.832 --> 01:33:09.001
And do they tell you
the result in advance?

01:33:09.084 --> 01:33:11.128
No. But my lawyers get told.

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:14.214
What, they get told and they
can't tell you? You're kidding?

01:33:14.298 --> 01:33:16.925
Yeah. They get the verdict
24 hours in advance.

01:33:17.009 --> 01:33:19.136
To the minute. 09:00 a.m.
the day before,

01:33:19.219 --> 01:33:21.263
to give 'em time
to prepare a response.

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:22.431
And what's worse,

01:33:22.514 --> 01:33:24.683
yeah, Irving gets it, too.

01:33:24.808 --> 01:33:26.727
Why?
Because he's his own lawyer.

01:33:26.810 --> 01:33:28.562
So he's allowed it
and I'm not.

01:33:30.981 --> 01:33:33.191
<i>I think this trial
is sending a chill</i>

01:33:33.275 --> 01:33:35.694
<i>through the community
of 20th century historians.</i>

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:37.487
<i>Which historian isn't thinking,</i>

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:39.906
<i>"Would my work survive
this kind of scrutiny?"</i>

01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:42.909
<i>Show me one historian who has
not broken into a cold sweat</i>

01:33:42.993 --> 01:33:45.120
<i>at the thought of undergoing
similar treatment.</i>

01:33:51.877 --> 01:33:53.503
<i>When people glibly say,</i>

01:33:53.837 --> 01:33:55.797
"Oh, if I'd have been in Germany,

01:33:55.881 --> 01:33:57.633
"I would never have collaborated,

01:33:57.716 --> 01:33:58.884
"I'd have resisted,"

01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:01.887
I just wanna laugh.

01:34:02.596 --> 01:34:04.640
Do you have any idea

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:07.684
how dangerous and
difficult it was?

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:12.981
Standing up to the
enemy was arduous

01:34:13.065 --> 01:34:16.526
and uncertain and exhausting.

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:20.864
But they had to do it.

01:34:22.908 --> 01:34:26.411
Only in hindsight that
things get called heroic.

01:34:28.163 --> 01:34:30.624
At the time
you're just afraid.

01:34:33.919 --> 01:34:36.421
Afraid of how things
will turn out.

01:34:45.138 --> 01:34:46.390
Deborah Lipstadt.

01:34:46.890 --> 01:34:48.308
Ah, good. There you are.

01:34:48.517 --> 01:34:49.685
Anthony.

01:34:49.768 --> 01:34:52.479
<i>Yeah. Just to say we've been told
to expect the verdict on Tuesday.</i>

01:34:52.562 --> 01:34:55.357
On Tuesday?
Are you sure?

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.859
You know, I don't think they'd
have said it unless it were true.

01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.194
I've been wondering
if we could

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:01.029
work out some kind of code.

01:35:01.113 --> 01:35:03.490
<i>Like I call and say,
"How's the weather?" and you say, "Good."</i>

01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:05.075
<i>Meaning...
Yeah, yeah, I get it.</i>

01:35:05.158 --> 01:35:07.953
Or you say the weather's bad
and that would mean...

01:35:08.036 --> 01:35:09.746
Only, of course,
I'd be disbarred.

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:11.873
I'd never be allowed to
practice law in England again.

01:35:12.457 --> 01:35:15.335
Oh, well, there'd be an upside.

01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:16.878
Ah.

01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:53.123
Yes?

01:35:54.875 --> 01:35:56.209
That one.

01:36:00.088 --> 01:36:01.298
Deborah.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:04.634
Well?

01:36:14.269 --> 01:36:16.313
Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

01:36:16.396 --> 01:36:18.106
Guilty! Filthy Jew!

01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:20.150
Jewish scum!

01:36:34.498 --> 01:36:35.499
Shame on you!

01:36:41.046 --> 01:36:43.757
Shame on you, Nazi lover!

01:36:46.802 --> 01:36:50.806
David! David! David!

01:37:05.445 --> 01:37:06.446
Oh.

01:37:11.618 --> 01:37:13.119
My Lord.
Hmm?

01:37:25.423 --> 01:37:27.676
Thank you, Jay.
One per person. Thank you.

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:28.927
Ladies first, I think.

01:37:29.010 --> 01:37:30.345
There you go. Thank you.

01:37:30.428 --> 01:37:32.055
One per person.
Thank you. I'll do it.

01:37:32.138 --> 01:37:35.141
<i>This massive 334-page document,</i>

01:37:35.225 --> 01:37:37.853
<i>which does not yet disclose
the final verdict,</i>

01:37:37.936 --> 01:37:39.938
is studiously even-handed.

01:37:40.021 --> 01:37:42.148
It is difficult to
say on which side

01:37:42.232 --> 01:37:44.401
Mr. Justice Gray's
decision will land.

01:37:44.484 --> 01:37:46.736
It praises Irving's
skill as a military historian,

01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:49.364
while at the same time
drawing attention to flaws

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:51.241
in some of his reasoning.

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:07.883
Court rise.

01:38:22.230 --> 01:38:25.567
<i>David Irving v. Penguin Books Limited</i>

01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:27.360
<i>and Deborah Lipstadt.</i>

01:38:29.487 --> 01:38:31.656
I shall read my judgment.

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:45.211
<i>It appears to me
that the correct</i>

01:38:45.295 --> 01:38:47.839
<i>and inevitable
inference must be</i>

01:38:47.923 --> 01:38:50.926
that the falsification of
the historical record

01:38:51.009 --> 01:38:55.680
was deliberate and that Irving was
motivated by a desire to present events

01:38:55.764 --> 01:38:59.267
in a manner consistent with
his own ideological beliefs,

01:38:59.351 --> 01:39:01.895
even if that involved distortion

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:05.065
and manipulation of historical evidence.

01:39:06.358 --> 01:39:07.984
In the result, therefore,

01:39:08.068 --> 01:39:11.696
the defense of justification, succeeds.

01:39:12.113 --> 01:39:15.325
The court finds
for the defendants.

01:39:16.534 --> 01:39:17.994
Court rise.

01:39:26.711 --> 01:39:29.339
I can't believe it!
It's true.

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:30.882
Well done. Well done.

01:39:30.966 --> 01:39:32.509
Well done.

<i>Mazel tov!</i>

01:39:36.763 --> 01:39:38.098
You've been brilliant.
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

01:39:38.181 --> 01:39:39.474
You didn't let me say anything.

01:39:39.557 --> 01:39:40.767
I didn't say a thing.

01:39:40.892 --> 01:39:42.310
Well, nor did I.
Think how I feel.

01:39:42.394 --> 01:39:44.479
It's not true.
It's not true, Deborah.

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:45.647
It was your book.

01:39:45.730 --> 01:39:47.232
Your book held up
in every aspect.

01:39:47.315 --> 01:39:48.942
Every aspect. Every detail.

01:39:49.025 --> 01:39:50.860
We defended it.
But it was the book.

01:39:50.944 --> 01:39:52.487
It was the book.
I know, I know, I know...

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:56.449
Thank you for all your hard work.
You are so welcome.

01:39:56.574 --> 01:39:57.826
It was like a dream job.

01:39:57.909 --> 01:40:00.829
Well done. Well done.

01:40:01.955 --> 01:40:04.582
Laura. Genius!

01:40:06.584 --> 01:40:08.294
<i>This has been
called one of the most</i>

01:40:08.378 --> 01:40:10.213
<i>crushing libel judgments in history.</i>

01:40:10.296 --> 01:40:11.589
<i>The judge called Mr. Irving</i>

01:40:11.673 --> 01:40:13.383
<i>an anti-Semite, a racist,</i>

01:40:13.466 --> 01:40:15.385
<i>and a distorter of history.</i>

01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:18.054
Can you tell us how you're
feeling at this time?

01:40:18.138 --> 01:40:20.098
I feel terrific.
This is a wonderful day.

01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:21.433
A wonderful day for everyone.

01:40:21.516 --> 01:40:24.102
Deborah. Deborah, how
do you feel about today's verdict?

01:40:25.687 --> 01:40:27.564
Now you can speak.

01:40:27.647 --> 01:40:28.940
Great.

01:40:29.024 --> 01:40:30.650
Can you expand
at all on that?

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:34.696
Come on. Come on...
Come to the press conference!

01:40:35.155 --> 01:40:37.657
<i>We saw this
as a free-speech issue.</i>

01:40:37.741 --> 01:40:39.159
<i>Penguin defended D.H. Lawrence.</i>

01:40:39.242 --> 01:40:40.618
We defended Salman Rushdie.

01:40:40.702 --> 01:40:41.786
It was inconceivable

01:40:41.870 --> 01:40:43.371
we wouldn't defend
Deborah Lipstadt.

01:40:43.455 --> 01:40:44.748
She's here. She's here.

01:40:49.169 --> 01:40:52.505
Miss Lipstadt? Miss Lipstadt?

01:40:52.589 --> 01:40:53.798
Deborah?

01:40:56.134 --> 01:40:58.094
Can I ask, do you
have any regrets

01:40:58.178 --> 01:40:59.554
about bringing the case?

01:40:59.637 --> 01:41:01.222
I don't know how to say
this often enough,

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:02.807
I didn't bring the case.

01:41:02.891 --> 01:41:04.559
Mr. Irving did.

01:41:04.642 --> 01:41:06.644
Although I'm not
sure he realized

01:41:06.728 --> 01:41:09.189
when he agreed to a trial
by a single judge,

01:41:09.272 --> 01:41:10.732
that it would mean
a written judgment.

01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:14.069
This judgment is gonna
stand against him forever.

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.780
Now, some people are saying
that the result of this trial

01:41:16.863 --> 01:41:18.782
will threaten free speech.

01:41:18.865 --> 01:41:20.366
I don't accept that.

01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:22.452
I'm not attacking free speech.

01:41:22.535 --> 01:41:25.080
On the contrary,
I've been defending it

01:41:25.163 --> 01:41:27.082
against someone
who wanted to abuse it.

01:41:27.499 --> 01:41:30.460
Freedom of speech means you
can say whatever you want.

01:41:30.543 --> 01:41:32.545
What you can't do is lie,

01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:35.423
and then expect not to be
held accountable for it.

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:38.009
Not all opinions are equal

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:39.886
and some things happen,

01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:42.263
just like we say they do.

01:41:42.639 --> 01:41:43.723
Slavery happened.

01:41:43.807 --> 01:41:45.683
The Black Death happened.

01:41:46.059 --> 01:41:47.352
The Earth is round.

01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:50.271
The ice caps are melting
and Elvis is not alive.

01:41:50.522 --> 01:41:52.941
Miss Lipstadt?

01:41:53.316 --> 01:41:55.652
You've conducted
yourself with dignity

01:41:55.735 --> 01:41:56.778
throughout the trial.

01:41:56.861 --> 01:41:59.364
Thank you. Uh, but I
know what that means.

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:01.991
That's code in England
for "I've shut up,"

01:42:02.075 --> 01:42:04.702
and I don't promise to shut
up in the future.

01:42:05.370 --> 01:42:07.122
Miss Lipstadt,
how convinced were you

01:42:07.205 --> 01:42:09.833
that this trial was going to
have a good outcome for you?

01:42:10.416 --> 01:42:14.504
Um, well, before
I came to London,

01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:17.632
I was definitely not convinced
that a court of law

01:42:17.715 --> 01:42:20.552
was a good place to
investigate historical truth.

01:42:21.719 --> 01:42:22.720
But...

01:42:23.555 --> 01:42:27.642
I underestimated
the value of a team.

01:42:28.309 --> 01:42:29.936
Of real teamwork.

01:42:30.019 --> 01:42:32.939
And it turns out
it's not a bad place.

01:42:33.815 --> 01:42:37.318
As long as you have great
lawyers with great passion.

01:42:37.402 --> 01:42:41.573
And, uh, my God, did I
have great lawyers.

01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:47.954
Miss Lipstadt, if you could say

01:42:48.037 --> 01:42:50.415
something now to David Irving,

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:51.499
what would you say?

01:42:52.584 --> 01:42:55.170
I wouldn't say anything to David Irving.

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:58.631
I would say something to the
survivors and to the murdered.

01:42:58.715 --> 01:43:00.341
And I would say...

01:43:03.136 --> 01:43:04.762
"You were remembered.

01:43:05.430 --> 01:43:08.516
"The voice of suffering was heard."

01:43:18.902 --> 01:43:20.904
You really are
quite good at this.

01:43:24.741 --> 01:43:25.950
Thank you.

01:43:30.288 --> 01:43:33.208
<i>I think if you
look at the judgment closely,</i>

01:43:33.291 --> 01:43:36.127
<i>you'll see there are all sorts
of things there in my favor.</i>

01:43:36.711 --> 01:43:38.796
<i>You're not seriously suggesting</i>

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:41.090
<i>that this judgment supports you?</i>

01:43:41.174 --> 01:43:44.135
<i>Well, plainly I ran
rings round the defense.</i>

01:43:44.219 --> 01:43:47.222
<i>My only regret is I didn't use
a mallet of sufficient caliber</i>

01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:50.058
<i>to ram my case into
the thick skull of the judge.</i>

01:43:50.141 --> 01:43:52.977
<i>Mr. Irving,
what people want to know</i>

01:43:53.061 --> 01:43:55.939
<i>is whether, on the basis
of this judgment,</i>

01:43:56.022 --> 01:43:59.442
<i>you will now stop
denying the Holocaust.</i>

01:44:02.445 --> 01:44:05.531
<i>Me? Stop? Good Lord, no.</i>

01:44:05.949 --> 01:44:07.533
<i>Despite the fact that</i>

01:44:07.617 --> 01:44:09.661
<i>the judge says,
"It appears to me..."</i>

01:44:09.744 --> 01:44:11.788
<i>Hello?</i>
Deborah?

01:44:12.247 --> 01:44:13.790
He seems to be saying he won.

01:44:13.873 --> 01:44:17.043
I know. He used
to be a Holocaust denier,

01:44:17.126 --> 01:44:18.211
<i>and now he's a verdict denier.</i>

01:44:18.294 --> 01:44:19.879
<i>The fact that she
didn't even dare to appear</i>

01:44:19.963 --> 01:44:21.756
<i>tells you everything you need
to know about Miss Lipstadt.</i>

01:44:22.006 --> 01:44:23.174
Let's just turn him off.

01:44:23.258 --> 01:44:24.926
<i>I don't think
her Brooklyn accent</i>

01:44:25.009 --> 01:44:26.636
<i>would have endeared
her to the court.</i>

01:44:26.928 --> 01:44:28.513
It's Queens.
