HEY. HOW'S
THAT BOOKCASE
COMING, OVERTON?

00:07.033 --> 00:10.066
IT'S JUST ABOUT FINISHED,
BUT I WOULDN'T MOVE IT UP

00:10.133 --> 00:13.433
TO YOUR POORLY VENTILATED ROOM
UNTIL THE LACQUER DRIES.

00:13.500 --> 00:16.866
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU TO TAKE
A NAP AND WAKE UP CROSS‐EYED.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.333
HEY, KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.466
COME ON, KITTY.

00:20.533 --> 00:22.066

OH.

00:31.300 --> 00:32.800
SYNCLAIRE

00:32.866 --> 00:36.833
NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE TO CAT‐SIT,
COULD YOU TRY TO FIND A FELINE

00:36.900 --> 00:40.100
THAT DIDN'T ESCAPE
FROM A STEPHEN KING NOVEL?

00:40.166 --> 00:41.500
HE'S JUST HUNGRY.

00:41.566 --> 00:44.566
THERE WASN'T ENOUGH FOOD
IN THOSE CANS MRS. WENIG LEFT.

00:44.633 --> 00:47.666
WELL, YOU'D THINK
BETWEEN THE HALF BALL OF YARN

00:47.733 --> 00:50.066
THE CATNIP MOUSE
AND REGINE'S EARRING

00:50.133 --> 00:52.500
HE'D HAVE BEEN FILLED UP BY NOW.

00:52.566 --> 00:55.066
YEAH, WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY
IT WAS ONLY RHINESTONE.

00:55.133 --> 00:58.133
OTHERWISE, I'D BE WEARING
THAT CAT TO WORK TOMORROW.

00:58.200 --> 01:00.440
SOMEBODY PEED ON MY PILLOW

01:02.140 --> 01:04.272
AND I'M HOPING
IT WAS THE CAT.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.640
I'M SORRY, BUT
DON'T BE MAD AT HIM.

01:06.706 --> 01:10.040
HE'S SUCH A CUTE
LITTLE FUZZY WUZZUMS.

I'M SORRY I YELLED AT YOU.

HERE'S SOME TASTY LIVER TREATS,
MUCH YUMMIER THAN MY FINGERS.

OH, I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT,
SWEET DIGITS.

02:13.613 --> 02:16.713
HOW MUCH LONGER WE GOT TO PUT UP
WITH CUJO KITTY?

02:16.779 --> 02:19.046
ACTUALLY, MRS. WENIG
SHOULD BE HOME NOW.

02:19.113 --> 02:22.513
SHE HAD TO PICK UP HER OTHER
FIVE CATS FROM THE KENNEL.

02:22.580 --> 02:25.213
IF SHE HAS FIVE OTHER CATS
AT THE KENNEL

02:25.280 --> 02:27.246
HOW WE GET STUCK WITH MITTENS?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.946
HE NEEDS MORE ATTENTION
THAN MOST CATS.

02:30.013 --> 02:32.546
PLUS, THE KENNEL BANNED HIM.

OW! OW! OH...

02:37.746 --> 02:40.780

02:40.846 --> 02:43.346
I CAN'T BREATHE
THROUGH MY NOSE, YOU KNOW?

02:43.413 --> 02:45.346
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN, MAX.

02:45.413 --> 02:48.346
KHADIJAH, REMEMBER THE TIME
I GOT THOSE TWO MARBLES

02:48.413 --> 02:49.913
STUCK UP MY NOSTRILS?

02:49.980 --> 02:53.213

02:59.780 --> 03:01.953
GIVE ME SOME SUGAR, BABY.

03:02.020 --> 03:04.286
OH, WAIT. DO NOT EXHALE
UNTIL I RETREAT.

03:04.353 --> 03:05.620
NO, NO, NO!

03:05.686 --> 03:06.653
UGH!

03:06.720 --> 03:07.986
OH, MY GOD!

03:08.053 --> 03:10.453
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO THE CAT.

03:10.520 --> 03:12.020
HERE'S A THOUGHT.

03:13.353 --> 03:16.053
LET'S GET AWAY
FROM THE CAT.

03:16.120 --> 03:17.286
I CAN'T.

03:17.353 --> 03:20.053
WHY NOT? YOU'RE
DRIVING ME CRAZY.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.953
LOOK AT THAT.

03:22.020 --> 03:24.120
YOU ANSWERED
YOUR OWN QUESTION.

03:25.886 --> 03:28.586
OKAY, MITTENS,
TIME TO TRAVEL.

03:28.653 --> 03:30.220
HERE, KITTY, KITTY, KITTY.

03:30.286 --> 03:31.220
COME ON, KITTY.

03:31.286 --> 03:32.286
( yowling )

03:34.220 --> 03:37.253
( yowling continues )

03:40.586 --> 03:41.986
I‐IS HE OKAY?

03:42.053 --> 03:43.586
UH, LET'S JUST SAY

03:43.653 --> 03:45.720
HE'S FEELING NO PAIN.

03:52.820 --> 03:54.420
HEY, YOU KNOW

03:54.486 --> 03:57.286
THE FRIDGE IS DOING
THAT "TOO COLD"
ROUTINE AGAIN?

03:57.353 --> 03:58.286
I WOULDN'T KNOW.

03:58.353 --> 04:00.293
I BEEN TOO BUSY CLEANING UP.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.660
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

04:01.726 --> 04:05.126
HEY, I DON'T DO
THE DEAD CAT THING.

04:05.193 --> 04:06.326
HERE'S YOUR EARRING.

04:08.260 --> 04:10.193
I THOUGHT MITTENS ATE THIS.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.760
HE DID.

04:11.826 --> 04:13.126
EW!

04:13.193 --> 04:15.626
YOU'RE SO NASTY!

04:15.693 --> 04:17.426
( khadijah laughing )

04:17.493 --> 04:18.660
SO...

04:18.726 --> 04:20.826
HOW DID MRS. WENIG
TAKE THE NEWS?

04:20.892 --> 04:22.360
SHE WAS PRETTY UPSET

04:22.426 --> 04:25.226
BUT I GUESS SHE WAS RELIEVED
MITTENS DIDN'T REALLY SUFFER.

04:25.293 --> 04:28.260
MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG
WITH THAT BOOKCASE.

04:28.326 --> 04:30.426
I MEAN,
THIS IS ALL MY FAULT

04:30.493 --> 04:32.660
AND MRS. WENIG'S
OTHER CATS KNEW IT.

04:32.726 --> 04:35.993
THEY STARED ME DOWN
WITH HATE IN THEIR EYES.

04:37.559 --> 04:39.059
OVERTON, THEY'RE CATS.

04:39.126 --> 04:40.426
THEY HATE ALL PEOPLE.

04:40.493 --> 04:43.260
ONLY REASON THEY DON'T KILL US,
'CAUSE THEY

04:43.326 --> 04:44.760
CAN'T PACK A GAT.

04:45.893 --> 04:48.926
I'M SO GLAD WE'LL ALL BE ABLE
TO PAY OUR RESPECTS

04:48.993 --> 04:50.293
AT MITTENS' FUNERAL.

04:50.360 --> 04:52.126
FUNERAL?

04:52.193 --> 04:53.626
FOR A CAT?

04:54.993 --> 04:57.660
WE OFFERED TO TAKE CARE
OF THE ARRANGEMENTS.

04:57.726 --> 04:59.526
IT'S THE LEAST WE COULD DO.

04:59.593 --> 05:01.533
THAT'S THE MOST WE COULD DO.

05:01.600 --> 05:05.466
THE LEAST WE COULD DO IS DROP
HIS ASS IN THE GARBAGE OUT BACK.

05:05.533 --> 05:06.866
I'M NOT GOING.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.933
YOU HAVE TO GO.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.666
MRS. WENIG
IS EXPECTING ALL OF US THERE.

05:10.733 --> 05:13.066
DON'T YOU AT LEAST
HAVE TO KNOW SOMEONE

05:13.133 --> 05:15.133
TO BE EXPECTED
AT THEIR FUNERAL?

05:15.200 --> 05:17.200
I THINK
YOU AUTOMATICALLY QUALIFY

05:17.266 --> 05:19.466
IF THEY WERE KILLED
IN YOUR HOUSE.

05:21.300 --> 05:22.833
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.100
SO, UH...

05:27.166 --> 05:29.433
IS IT GOING TO BE
AN OPEN OR CLOSED SHOE BOX?

05:29.500 --> 05:30.666
OH, MY GOD!

05:30.733 --> 05:32.433
KHADIJAH! KHADIJAH!
KHADIJAH!

05:32.500 --> 05:34.200
KHADIJAH, THIS IS SERIOUS.

05:34.266 --> 05:36.933
MITTENS HAS CROSSED OVER.

05:38.166 --> 05:39.633
KHADIJAH'S JOKE‐‐

05:39.700 --> 05:41.033
ALTHOUGH IN
POOR TASTE‐‐

05:41.100 --> 05:42.700
HAS GIVEN ME
AN IDEA.

05:42.766 --> 05:44.966
YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:45.033 --> 05:48.433
I'M GOING TO BUILD
MITTENS A CAT CASKET.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.833
'COURSE, IT'S
GOING TO BE

05:50.900 --> 05:52.233
SOMEBODY ELSE'S JOB

05:52.300 --> 05:54.700
TO MAKE MITTENS LOOK
LIKE A CAT AGAIN.

06:02.706 --> 06:05.073
Synclaire:
HE WAS A GOOD CAT, A PROUD CAT

06:05.140 --> 06:07.540
A CAT THAT HAD
EVERYTHING TO LIVE FOR

06:07.606 --> 06:09.840
AND, YET, I THINK
WE CAN ALL BE HAPPY

06:09.906 --> 06:11.873
HE'S GONE TO A BETTER PLACE.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.140
I BELIEVE

06:14.206 --> 06:15.606
THAT IN KITTY HEAVEN

06:15.673 --> 06:19.206
IT RAINS MILK,
AND EVERY MOUSE HAS A LIMP.

06:20.473 --> 06:21.740
IN DOGGIE HEAVEN

06:21.806 --> 06:24.473
THERE ARE FIRE HYDRANTS
ON EVERY CORNER

06:24.540 --> 06:26.373
AND PLENTY OF CATS TO CHASE.

06:28.140 --> 06:31.040
MAYBE DOGGIE HEAVEN
IS KITTY HELL.

06:31.106 --> 06:32.673
ANYWAY...

06:32.740 --> 06:34.240
WHEN MY SCRATCHES HEAL

06:34.306 --> 06:37.373
ALL I'LL LEFT ARE THE MEMORIES
AND THE SCARS.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.106
GOOD‐BYE, MITTENS.

06:40.340 --> 06:41.706
WELL, OBIE

06:41.773 --> 06:44.473
MAN, YOU DID A GREAT JOB
ON THAT CASKET.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.173
YOU'VE OUTDONE YOURSELF,
MAN.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.673
YEAH, I LINED IT
WITH PINSTRIPE

06:48.740 --> 06:52.440
TO MATCH THE SUIT
THAT MRS. WENIG
BURIED MITTENS IN.

06:52.506 --> 06:53.373
( sobbing )

06:53.440 --> 06:54.440
I'M COMING THROUGH.

06:54.506 --> 06:55.573
HAS THE DEMISE

06:55.640 --> 06:56.673
OF MITTENS

06:56.740 --> 06:58.906
BROUGHT OUT THE
TENDER SIDE OF MAX?

06:58.973 --> 07:00.413
FREAK THE CAT.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.046
DO YOU MIND?

07:02.113 --> 07:05.246
I JUST RECEIVED
SOME VERY DISTURBING NEWS.

07:05.313 --> 07:08.513
OH, WAIT. WHAT'D
THE DOCTOR SAY, BABY?

07:08.580 --> 07:11.846
SHE SAID THAT I'VE
DEVELOPED AN ALLERGY

07:11.913 --> 07:13.880
AND IT'S NOT TO CATS.

07:13.946 --> 07:16.646
OKAY, TO WHAT THEN?

07:16.713 --> 07:18.146
( whispering ):
CHOCOLATE.

07:18.213 --> 07:19.180
( sobbing )

07:19.246 --> 07:20.746
OH, DEAR LORD.

07:20.813 --> 07:22.313
WHY?!

07:22.380 --> 07:26.846
WHY COULDN'T I BE ALLERGIC
TO DUST OR PENICILLIN...

07:26.913 --> 07:28.413
OR YOU?

07:31.313 --> 07:35.046
IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO ME
AND THE OTHER CATS

07:35.113 --> 07:38.280
IF YOU WOULD SAY A FEW WORDS
ABOUT MITTENS.

07:38.346 --> 07:41.346
HE ALWAYS SPOKE
SO HIGHLY OF YOU.

07:42.646 --> 07:44.146
( sobbing )

07:44.213 --> 07:45.713
AFTER YOU'RE
DONE GRIEVING

07:45.780 --> 07:49.046
YOU MIGHT WANT TO
TALK TO SOMEONE...
YOU KNOW, HUMAN.

07:57.546 --> 07:59.013
HE CAME...

07:59.080 --> 08:01.086
HE SHED, HE DIED.

08:02.386 --> 08:03.420
KYLE?

08:03.486 --> 08:06.753
OH, SO YOUNG, SO YOUNG.

THAT THAT'S THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
CAT CASKET SHE'S EVER SEEN.

08:40.720 --> 08:42.520
( all gasp )

08:45.453 --> 08:48.020
DANG. IF MITTENS
WASN'T ALREADY DEAD

08:48.086 --> 08:50.486
THAT WOULD HAVE KILLED
HIM AGAIN.

08:57.553 --> 09:00.386
( raucous laughter )

09:00.453 --> 09:04.560
SO THEN, AFTER MRS. WENIG
TOOK A SWING AT OVERTON

09:04.626 --> 09:06.493
THEY HAD TO SEDATE HER

09:06.560 --> 09:09.960
AND BURY THE DOGGONE CAT
IN A GIANT ZIPLOC.

09:13.160 --> 09:17.726
I CANNOT BELIEVE I MISSED
A CAT FALLING OUT OF A CASKET.

09:17.793 --> 09:21.093
I GUESS THEY DON'T FALL
ON THEIR FEET, NOW DO THEY?

09:24.060 --> 09:25.326
WHO CARES?

09:25.393 --> 09:27.393
THAT LOONY OLD LADY
CAN GET A CAT

09:27.460 --> 09:28.826
BEHIND ANY FISH MARKET.

09:28.893 --> 09:31.360
I AM ALLERGIC TO CHOCOLATE.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.760
YOU'RE KIDDING.

09:35.826 --> 09:38.193
AND HAS ANYBODY TAUNTED YOU
ABOUT THIS?

09:39.460 --> 09:40.460
OH, OKAY.

09:40.526 --> 09:41.493
NOW I SEE

09:41.560 --> 09:42.826
WHERE I FIT IN.

09:42.893 --> 09:43.993
MMM!

09:48.326 --> 09:50.160
OH, COME ON, OVERTON, MAN.

09:50.226 --> 09:51.560
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

09:51.626 --> 09:52.893
NO, KYLE.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.560
IT WAS DEFINITELY A WAKE‐UP CALL

09:55.626 --> 09:58.826
FROM THE GREAT CARPENTER
IN THE SKY.

09:58.893 --> 10:00.600
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:00.666 --> 10:03.633
AFTER THAT BOOKCASE FELL APART,
I RETRACED MY STEPS

10:03.700 --> 10:06.500
AND I STILL COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
WHAT WENT WRONG.

10:06.566 --> 10:08.933
THEN THE COFFIN FELL APART.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.400
NEXT TIME SOMETHING I BUILD
FALLS APART

10:12.466 --> 10:16.833
IT COULD BE ON TOP OF REGINE
OR SOMEBODY IMPORTANT.

10:18.933 --> 10:21.366
MUCH AS IT PAINS ME
TO SAY THIS

10:21.433 --> 10:25.000
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO JUST MOVE ON.

10:25.066 --> 10:27.500
I'M UH...

10:27.566 --> 10:29.500
I'M HANGING UP MY TOOL BELT.

10:29.566 --> 10:31.166
OH, COME ON, OVERTON.

10:31.233 --> 10:32.233
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.500
YEAH, MAN.

10:33.566 --> 10:34.833
I MEAN, IF EVERYONE QUIT

10:34.900 --> 10:37.000
EVERY TIME THEY MADE
A MISTAKE AT <i>FLAVOR</i>

10:37.066 --> 10:38.200
I'D BE PRETTY LONELY.

10:38.266 --> 10:39.900
I HEARD THAT.

10:42.233 --> 10:43.566
COME ON, OVERTON.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.333
MAN, YOU CANNOT QUIT
YOUR JOB OVER THIS.

10:48.733 --> 10:51.333
NOPE. EVERY HANDYMAN
HAS HIS TIME

10:51.400 --> 10:53.266
AND MINE IS CLEARLY UP.

10:53.333 --> 10:55.566
JUST LIKE THE GREAT ATHLETE

10:55.633 --> 10:59.233
WHO CAN NO LONGER HIT THE BALL
OVER THE FENCE

10:59.300 --> 11:01.773
OR SINK THAT 20‐FOOT JUMP SHOT

11:01.840 --> 11:04.773
OR DO THE ICKY SHUFFLE
IN THE END ZONE.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.840
THIS HANDYMAN IS THROUGH.

11:09.273 --> 11:11.440
I WON'T HEAR OF IT.

11:11.506 --> 11:13.406
WHO WANTS A COFFIN MADE BY OBIE?

11:13.473 --> 11:14.473
COME ON!

11:16.006 --> 11:17.406
HERE WE GO.

11:19.673 --> 11:21.640
I FEEL SO BAD FOR HIM.

11:23.706 --> 11:25.573
MAXINE, YOUR ALLERGIES.

11:25.640 --> 11:28.006
I'M NOT GOING TO SWALLOW.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.006
GUYS DOWN IN THE
PLUMBING DEPARTMENT

11:40.073 --> 11:41.340
TOLD ME WHAT HAPPENED.

11:41.406 --> 11:42.573
BUT I THOUGHT
IT WAS

11:42.640 --> 11:44.440
SOME KIND OF SICK,
TWISTED JOKE

11:44.506 --> 11:46.206
BY A BUNCH
OF TOILET JOCKEYS.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.240
NO JOKE, PUG.

11:48.306 --> 11:49.906
I AM HANDY NO MORE.

11:49.973 --> 11:50.806
WHAT YOU DRINKING?

11:50.873 --> 11:52.373
COME ON, OBIE.

11:52.440 --> 11:56.406
I'M AS TORN UP AS THE NEXT GUY
OVER WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT CAT

11:56.473 --> 11:59.440
BUT FACE IT, MAN‐‐
THOSE THINGS DIE EVERY DAY.

11:59.506 --> 12:01.746
I MEAN, I BACKED OVER ONE
LAST WEEK

12:01.813 --> 12:04.980
BUT YOU DON'T SEE ME
WALKING TO WORK, DO YOU?

12:05.046 --> 12:07.313
OVERTON, THAT BEER'S
POURING PRETTY SLOW.

12:07.380 --> 12:08.913
THINK YOU CAN FIX IT?

12:08.980 --> 12:10.046
CAN HE FIX IT?

12:10.113 --> 12:12.413
IS USING A TABLE SAW NAKED
A BAD IDEA?

12:12.480 --> 12:14.180
OF COURSE HE CAN FIX IT.

12:14.246 --> 12:15.913
SHOW HIM, OBIE. FIX IT.

12:15.980 --> 12:21.213
UH, SORRY, MIKE, BUT I DON'T DO
THAT SORT OF THING ANYMORE.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.180
I GUESS I'LL CALL THE REPAIRMAN.

12:23.246 --> 12:25.380
IF I TELL HIM
IT'S WET T‐SHIRT NIGHT

12:25.446 --> 12:26.813
HE MAY SHOW UP.

12:38.446 --> 12:39.513
COME ON, OVERTON.

12:39.580 --> 12:41.180
PUT THAT IN A BOWL
FOR PUG.

12:41.246 --> 12:42.313
NOT NOW, KYLE.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.413
I'M TOO DEPRESSED
TO MAKE FUN OF YOU

12:44.480 --> 12:46.213
FOR WEARING
THAT TABLECLOTH.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.846
I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

12:48.913 --> 12:50.546
Synclaire:
WELL, OBIE, IT LOOKS

12:50.613 --> 12:52.080
LIKE YOU'RE HAVING
FUN HERE.

12:52.146 --> 12:53.146
OH, WELL.

12:55.046 --> 12:56.313
SCOTCH, NEAT.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.213
ON THE ROCKS, NO ICE.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.653
SYNCLAIRE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.020
IF OVERTON'S
WORKING HERE

13:03.086 --> 13:04.620
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO GET USED

13:04.686 --> 13:05.986
TO BEING A BARFLY.

13:06.053 --> 13:09.553
WELL, OVERTON, IF YOU WANT
TO AVOID HURTING PEOPLE

13:09.620 --> 13:11.853
THIS SURE IS THE PLACE‐‐

13:11.920 --> 13:14.386
SERVING UP ALCOHOL,
SELLING CIGARETTES...

13:14.453 --> 13:16.986
JUST KIND OF
KILLING THEM SLOWLY

13:17.053 --> 13:18.220
AREN'T YOU?

13:19.553 --> 13:20.520
YUP.

13:20.586 --> 13:21.753
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

13:21.820 --> 13:23.020
ALL RIGHT, OVERTON

13:23.086 --> 13:24.786
I DIDN'T WANT TO GO HERE.

13:24.853 --> 13:28.486
YOUR HARDWARE DIGEST
CAME THIS MORNING.

13:28.553 --> 13:32.220
IT'S THE "METRIC TOOLS"
ISSUE. <i>YEAH.</i>

13:34.153 --> 13:37.320
YOU KNOW, BABY, UH...

13:37.386 --> 13:38.920
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

13:38.986 --> 13:42.720
THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE
LIT UP MY WORLD

13:42.786 --> 13:45.086
BUT TODAY,
IT'S JUST ANOTHER MAGAZINE.

13:46.486 --> 13:50.420
JUST ANOTHER MAGAZINE!?

13:50.486 --> 13:52.253
WHO ARE YOU, MAN?

13:58.820 --> 14:02.993
WHOO. THERE IS NOTHING
TO TOP OFF A MEAL

14:03.060 --> 14:07.260
LIKE A NICE CUP
OF CHOCOLATEY PUDDING.

14:07.326 --> 14:10.193
OOH. AND THIS ONE'S
MY FAVORITE TOO, YOU KNOW?

14:10.260 --> 14:14.993
"SINFULLY DELICIOUS,
DOUBLE FUDGE, CHOCOLATE CHIP...

14:15.060 --> 14:17.326
WITH MORE CHOCOLATE."

14:19.126 --> 14:20.693
PLAY YOUR
LITTLE GAME, REGINE.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.826
THERE ARE OTHER,
NON‐CHOCOLATE, DESSERTS

14:22.893 --> 14:24.526
THAT CAN SATISFY
MY SWEET TOOTH

14:24.593 --> 14:26.860
LIKE THIS MOUTH‐WATERING
GRAHAM CRACKER.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.860
MAYBE A LITTLE
ROCK‐SOLID WHIPPED CREAM

14:40.926 --> 14:42.193
ON THAT WOULD WORK.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.493
THAT'S IT, YOU ALL.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.760
WE HAVE GOT TO GET
THAT REFRIGERATOR FIXED.

14:45.826 --> 14:47.693
WHEN IS
THAT BOYFRIEND OF YOURS

14:47.760 --> 14:51.093
GETTING OFF
HIS PITY TRAIN?

14:51.160 --> 14:52.093
I DON'T KNOW.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.226
HE'S REALLY HURTING.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.993
HE CAN'T EVEN COME UP

14:55.060 --> 14:56.560
WITH PET NAMES FOR ME ANYMORE.

14:56.626 --> 15:02.166
YESTERDAY, HE CALLED ME
HIS LITTLE WHATCHAMACALLIT.

15:02.233 --> 15:03.766
WELL, I AM NOT WAITING.

15:03.833 --> 15:06.600
I'M GETTING THE LANDLORD
TO FIX THIS.

15:10.766 --> 15:12.366
HI, MR. JANOLLARI.

15:12.433 --> 15:15.400
HEY, IT'S KHADIJAH JAMES,
YOUR FAVORITE TENANT.

15:15.466 --> 15:18.266
LISTEN, MAN, WE GOT
A REFRIGERATOR OVER HERE

15:18.333 --> 15:20.600
THAT COULD COOL OFF
THE WHOLE BUILDING.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.533
WHAT?

15:24.600 --> 15:26.700
OH, I SEE. ALL RIGHT.

15:26.766 --> 15:27.800
THANK YOU.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.500
HE SAID WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
A NEW HANDYMAN BY FRIDAY.

15:32.566 --> 15:33.900
WHAT?

15:35.233 --> 15:36.533
ALL RIGHT.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.733
THIS COULD BE
THE THING OVERTON NEEDS.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.466
I'M GOING TO TELL HIM
HE'S ABOUT TO BE REPLACED.

15:41.533 --> 15:44.066
NO OTHER MAN'S GOING
TO GROUT MY TUB, OKAY?

15:46.166 --> 15:49.466
BRING SOME RAISINETTES
WITHOUT THE CHOCOLATE.

15:49.533 --> 15:51.966
WOULDN'T THAT
JUST BE RAISINS, MAX?

15:52.033 --> 15:54.366
I CAN DREAM, CAN'T I?

15:55.833 --> 15:58.133
YUP. COUPLE MORE MINUTES

15:58.200 --> 16:00.540
AND THIS BEER
IS ALL YOURS.

16:03.473 --> 16:04.606
HEY, EVERYONE.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.540
All:
SYNCLAIRE!

16:09.206 --> 16:11.140
HELLO, MY LITTLE...

16:11.206 --> 16:12.540
UM... HEY!

16:14.206 --> 16:16.306
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

16:16.373 --> 16:17.706
THE USUAL.

16:17.773 --> 16:20.573
ONE VIRGIN MUDSLIDE
COMING RIGHT UP.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.773
AND I'LL HAVE
A BOMBAY SAPPHIRE MARTINI

16:22.840 --> 16:24.073
STRAIGHT UP, VERY DRY.

16:24.140 --> 16:26.473
RUB THE LEMON TWIST
HALFWAY AROUND THE RIM

16:26.540 --> 16:28.640
AND DON'T TELL ME
WHICH HALF.

16:28.706 --> 16:31.073
HOW ABOUT A VIRGIN MUDSLIDE?

16:31.140 --> 16:33.373
FAIR ENOUGH.

16:34.973 --> 16:35.973
OKAY, NOW, LISTEN.

16:36.040 --> 16:37.306
WE CAN'T COME RIGHT OUT

16:37.373 --> 16:39.273
AND TELL HIM
HE'S BEING REPLACED.

16:39.340 --> 16:40.506
OVERTON IS A PROUD MAN

16:40.573 --> 16:42.573
AND THAT WILL MAKE HIM
MORE RESISTANT.

16:42.640 --> 16:44.440
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO BE...

16:44.506 --> 16:45.473
SUBTLE.

16:45.540 --> 16:46.473
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.273
AND USE JUST
A TOUCH OF...

16:48.340 --> 16:49.640
FINESSE.

16:49.706 --> 16:52.573
YES. NOW DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN HANDLE THAT?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.240
I'LL FOLLOW YOUR LEAD.

16:54.306 --> 16:55.406
OKAY, OKAY.

16:57.140 --> 16:58.273
ALL RIGHT,
SO, KYLE

16:58.340 --> 17:00.746
HOW ARE THINGS DOWN
BY WHERE YOU WORK?

17:00.813 --> 17:01.746
WELL...

17:01.813 --> 17:02.946
BECAUSE
AT THE BROWNSTONE

17:03.013 --> 17:04.445
THEY'RE HIRING
A NEW HANDYMAN.

17:04.512 --> 17:06.413
IT'LL SURE BE NICE

17:06.480 --> 17:08.280
TO HAVE A STRANGER
WITH A PASSKEY

17:08.346 --> 17:09.980
JUST COME AND GO
AS HE PLEASES.

17:10.046 --> 17:11.512
HIS NAME IS JOSHUA.

17:11.579 --> 17:15.945
HE'S GOT 18 YEARS EXPERIENCE,
A LOVING WIFE, THREE KIDS

17:16.012 --> 17:18.346
AND THIS IS ONE SAD PERFORMANCE.

17:18.413 --> 17:20.813
NICE GOING, KYLE.

17:24.512 --> 17:27.546
ROB SHARP,
LODGE BAR REPAIR.

17:27.613 --> 17:30.213
OVERTON WAKEFIELD JONES,
BARTENDER.

17:30.280 --> 17:31.280
MAN, IT'S THIS TAP.

17:31.346 --> 17:32.580
BEEN DRIVING
ME CRAZY...

17:32.646 --> 17:34.480
MR. JONES,
I KNOW YOU'RE CONCERNED

17:34.546 --> 17:36.580
BUT THE BEST THING
YOU CAN DO TO HELP

17:36.646 --> 17:37.646
IS TO STEP ASIDE.

17:40.680 --> 17:43.313
YOU MUST HAVE
EVERY TOOL
THEY MAKE.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.613
Overton:
OH, MAN.

17:48.680 --> 17:52.113
THIS IS A 48‐PIECE SOCKET SET
WITH THREE‐EIGHTHS

17:52.180 --> 17:54.080
TO HALF‐INCH CONVERSIONS.

17:55.813 --> 18:02.853
THE RATCHET'S MADE
OF A TEMPERED STEEL ALLOY‐‐

18:02.920 --> 18:06.020
COLD TO THE TOUCH.

18:06.086 --> 18:10.086
HOLDING ONE IN YOUR HAND
MAKES YOU FEEL COMPLETE‐‐

18:10.153 --> 18:15.020
LIKE THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE WORLD YOU CAN'T TIGHTEN.

18:15.086 --> 18:16.420
Sharp:
WELL!

18:16.486 --> 18:18.820
I REAMED THE TAP
AS PER MANUAL SPECS.

18:18.886 --> 18:20.486
IT'S STILL
POURING SLOWLY.

18:20.553 --> 18:22.953
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO REPLACE THE UNIT.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.520
I'M GOING IN.

18:24.586 --> 18:25.653
REPLACE IT?

18:25.720 --> 18:27.286
THIS IS A VINTAGE
TAP 'N' FLOW.

18:27.353 --> 18:29.653
YOU DIDN'T EVEN BOTHER
TO CHECK THE PRESSURE

18:29.720 --> 18:30.720
DOWN IN THE...

18:31.853 --> 18:36.153
UH, WHO WANTS A LIME RICKEY?

18:36.220 --> 18:37.486
COME ON, OVERTON.

18:37.553 --> 18:39.153
IF HE'S DOING IT
INCORRECTLY

18:39.220 --> 18:41.020
AT LEAST TELL HIM
HOW TO DO IT.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.053
YEAH, OBIE,
YOU WOULDN'T ACTUALLY

18:43.120 --> 18:44.453
BE TOUCHING
THE TOOLS.

18:44.520 --> 18:45.953
WELL, I GUESS I COULD.

18:46.020 --> 18:49.653
WOULDN'T HURT ANYBODY
IF I JUST TALKED HIM THROUGH IT.

18:49.720 --> 18:50.620
THERE YOU GO.

18:50.686 --> 18:52.286
IT WOULD BE LIKE CHARLTON HESTON

18:52.353 --> 18:54.286
HELPING KAREN BLACK
LAND THAT JUMBO JET

18:54.353 --> 18:55.320
IN <i>AIRPORT '75.</i>

18:55.386 --> 18:56.820
YES, YES!

18:56.886 --> 18:58.286
YO, ROB, UH...

18:58.353 --> 19:00.960
BEFORE YOU THROW AWAY
THIS HIGH‐PRICED EQUIPMENT

19:01.026 --> 19:02.326
YOU MIND CHECKING
THE POUR

19:02.393 --> 19:03.626
TO SEE
IF IT'S INHIBITED

19:03.693 --> 19:06.626
BY THE LOW PRESSURE
OF THE CO2?

19:06.693 --> 19:10.493
FRIEND, THE GAUGE READS
27 POUNDS.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.893
THAT'S PER SPECS.

19:14.260 --> 19:17.126
WELL, WHAT IF THE GAUGE
IS MALFUNCTIONING...

19:17.193 --> 19:18.960
<i>BUDDY?</i>

19:21.860 --> 19:23.293
IF IT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER

19:23.360 --> 19:26.026
I'LL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK
AT IT.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.393
THIS IS JUST THE THING
OBIE NEEDS

19:29.460 --> 19:31.126
TO GET HIM
TO COME AROUND.

19:31.193 --> 19:33.026
I ONLY HOPE SO

19:33.093 --> 19:38.226
BECAUSE HE MAKES A DECIDEDLY
SUBSTANDARD VIRGIN MUDSLIDE.

19:38.293 --> 19:40.293
OH, IT STILL READS 27.

19:40.360 --> 19:41.960
IT IS THE GAUGE.

19:42.026 --> 19:43.093
ALL YOU GOT TO DO

19:43.160 --> 19:44.626
IS ADD A NEW
PRESSURE SLEEVE.

19:44.693 --> 19:46.093
NO, NO. THE MANUAL SAYS

19:46.160 --> 19:47.960
YOU HAVE TO PULL
THE CO2 UNIT.

19:48.026 --> 19:50.626
THE MANUAL'S WRONG.

19:50.693 --> 19:52.893
OH, SO YOU'RE
A MAVERICK.

19:52.960 --> 19:57.160
OKAY. YOU WANT TO GO
AGAINST THE MANUAL? FINE.

19:57.226 --> 19:59.166
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

20:13.966 --> 20:15.666
LET'S DO THIS.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.900
WELL, THAT SHOULD
JUST ABOUT DO IT.

20:25.966 --> 20:28.066
YEAH, I JUST GOT ONE QUESTION.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.233
WHO'S THIRSTY?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.033
( applause and cheers )

20:34.466 --> 20:36.400
YO, ROB.

20:36.466 --> 20:38.333
YOU GOT ANY OF THAT
WOODY WOOD GLUE

20:38.400 --> 20:39.833
IN THAT SOUPED‐UP
TOOL BOX?

20:39.900 --> 20:41.600
I'M GOING TO FIX
THIS TAP HANDLE.

20:41.666 --> 20:42.833
IT'S DRIVING ME
CRAZY.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.166
WOODY WOOD GLUE?

20:44.233 --> 20:45.566
I GOT RID OF THAT STUFF.

20:45.633 --> 20:47.700
THEY JUST RECALLED
LAST MONTH'S BATCH.

20:47.766 --> 20:49.200
IT DIDN'T HOLD ITS SEAL.

20:51.166 --> 20:57.166
SO, IF YOU USED
THAT FAULTY GLUE...

20:57.233 --> 20:58.333
UH‐HUH.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.940
ON A COFFIN YOU BUILT

21:01.006 --> 21:05.073
BECAUSE A BOOKCASE
KILLED A CAT...

21:05.140 --> 21:06.806
COME ON, COME ON.
YEAH, YEAH.

21:06.873 --> 21:08.840
'CAUSE YOU USED THE SAME GLUE...

21:08.906 --> 21:10.340
Kyle:
MM‐HMM.

21:10.406 --> 21:12.940
RIGHT ABOUT NOW,
YOU PROBABLY REALIZE

21:13.006 --> 21:16.140
THAT IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT
THAT IT FELL APART.

21:16.206 --> 21:17.940
HELL, NO!

21:18.006 --> 21:21.040
IT'S THE RISK
WE RUN EVERY DAY.

21:21.106 --> 21:23.673
AH!

21:23.740 --> 21:25.340
COME TO MAMA, OBIE.

21:25.406 --> 21:27.073
ALL RIGHT, MY ZESTY ZINFANDEL.

21:30.573 --> 21:32.173
I JUST WISH I HAD

21:32.240 --> 21:34.006
SOMETHING ELSE TO FIX
AROUND HERE.

21:34.073 --> 21:35.773
OH, OH, OH, OH,

21:36.906 --> 21:37.940
OKAY.

21:38.006 --> 21:38.940
FIX IT.

21:39.006 --> 21:40.773
FIX THAT.

21:40.840 --> 21:44.440
SYNCLAIRE, YOU KNOW
I CAN'T FIX WATCHES.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.340
