00:26.415 --> 00:30.116
...cases were confirmed today,
according to state-run...

00:30.216 --> 00:33.783
...quarantine alert and mobilized
a national epidemic...

00:33.883 --> 00:38.349
...signs of the contagious illness
will receive special treatment here.

00:38.449 --> 00:41.617
...the Department of Health
has issued a nationwide quarantine

00:41.717 --> 00:44.683
and mobilized a national
epidemic prevention plan.

00:44.783 --> 00:48.349
With concerns that Chinese authorities
may not be telling the whole story,

00:48.449 --> 00:53.249
American officials are tightening screenings
at all points of entry to the United States.

00:53.349 --> 00:56.673
We'll hear about the political pressure
around this issue later, but first,

00:56.773 --> 00:59.216
Julia... begins our coverage from Dallas.

00:59.316 --> 01:02.016
...believed to be caused
by a small wormlike parasite,

01:02.116 --> 01:04.316
the public is calling
the condition "worm flu."

01:04.416 --> 01:09.683
Symptoms include increased appetite, fever,
bloody cough and, in some cases, seizure.

01:09.783 --> 01:12.430
While this is scary,
it's not like the common cold.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.583
Worm flu can only be spread
through the transmission of blood.

01:15.683 --> 01:18.015
Nevertheless, U.S. officials are on alert.

01:18.115 --> 01:21.282
President Barack Obama issued
the following address this morning.

01:21.382 --> 01:24.150
We will continue
to closely monitor the situation.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.220
We're also going to be
working on protocols, uh...

01:27.320 --> 01:33.282
to do additional passenger screening both
at the source and here in the United States.

01:33.382 --> 01:37.769
Uh, all of these things make me confident
that here in the United States, at least,

01:37.868 --> 01:40.882
uh, we... uh, the chances of an outbreak...

01:40.982 --> 01:44.696
uh, of an epidemic here
are extraordinarily low.

02:18.866 --> 02:21.030
- You creepin'?
- No.

02:21.130 --> 02:23.917
- Do you have food? Please?
- I don't know. Maybe.

02:24.017 --> 02:25.650
- Yoink!
- Help yourself.

02:25.750 --> 02:27.534
I cannot stop eating today.

02:27.634 --> 02:31.733
I polished off a whole row of Double
Stuf this morning. It's ridiculous.

02:32.132 --> 02:34.199
- Hey.
- Hey, Evan.

02:35.498 --> 02:37.853
- "Hey, Evan."
- I didn't say it like that.

02:37.953 --> 02:40.466
Yeah, you did, though.
Seriously, you better step it up

02:40.566 --> 02:43.578
before you lose your like, new girl glow.

02:43.678 --> 02:45.882
- Really? How?
- Well, like, show some boob, like...

02:45.982 --> 02:47.700
- I don't have any boobs.
- You don't.

02:47.799 --> 02:50.652
Maybe he's, like, an ass guy.
It's not that big of a deal.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.321
We're gonna be late, come on.

02:53.421 --> 02:56.250
Ugh... Oh, God.

02:59.132 --> 03:00.600
Oh, God...

03:00.700 --> 03:02.866
Now, you supposed to be Little Miss Biology.

03:02.966 --> 03:06.812
Don't tell me you afraid of a dead frog.
Get him, girl.

03:08.332 --> 03:11.549
Oh, God. It looks like
it's throwing up from its neck.

03:11.649 --> 03:15.066
Come on. Em... do it.

03:15.166 --> 03:18.032
- I can't do this.
- Ooh, that is nasty.

03:19.581 --> 03:22.915
You know what helps me
when I'm feeling squeamish?

03:23.015 --> 03:26.015
Gum. I'll leave it right there for you.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.367
Thanks.

03:29.765 --> 03:31.330
Gum.

03:32.848 --> 03:36.199
Lucifer? You and the devil
on a first-name basis?

03:36.299 --> 03:38.501
Unfortunately yes.

03:43.266 --> 03:44.899
Hey.

03:44.999 --> 03:46.466
Em...

03:46.566 --> 03:49.932
- Thanks for getting me in trouble again.
- Calm down.

03:50.332 --> 03:52.449
Em, wait up.

03:52.549 --> 03:55.916
- What?
- You're the bestest sister in the world.

03:56.266 --> 03:58.400
If that's the hand that just touched
your vag, I'm gonna kill you.

03:58.500 --> 04:01.851
- It was this one.
- Aw, dude!

04:07.463 --> 04:11.970
- All right, I'll see you. Bye, Emma.
- Hey. So you're Stacey's sister.

04:12.070 --> 04:16.488
- Yep. I'm Emma.
- So... I am CJ.

04:16.588 --> 04:18.706
- I've heard about you.
- That's right.

04:18.805 --> 04:22.919
- What happened to your foot?
- Um, yeah. I broke it.

04:23.019 --> 04:25.583
- How'd you break it?
- Shark attack.

04:26.032 --> 04:29.211
- Wow.
- It looked a little something like this.

04:34.865 --> 04:36.777
- Come over later?
- Yeah, I'll try.

04:36.877 --> 04:39.732
All right. Emmalicious, stay vivacious.

04:39.832 --> 04:42.647
- Thank you.
- Peace out.

04:44.982 --> 04:46.006
Real class act.

04:46.106 --> 04:49.452
Just mixing with the locals.
You should try it sometime.

04:58.999 --> 05:01.516
- Hey! What's his name?
- Evan, why?

05:01.616 --> 05:03.435
- Evan!
- What are you doing?

05:03.535 --> 05:05.839
- Be a good neighbor. Offer him a ride home.
- Don't!

05:05.939 --> 05:07.599
You want a ride?

05:07.698 --> 05:09.933
- Taking the bus.
- Yeah, he's taking the bus.

05:10.033 --> 05:14.266
Uh, it's, like, the last stop. It's gonna
take forever. We insist. Don't we, Em?

05:14.366 --> 05:17.446
Yeah. Of course.

05:18.949 --> 05:21.467
- Why are you being such a bitch?
- 'Cause you don't have balls.

05:21.567 --> 05:23.779
I have balls.

05:25.049 --> 05:27.909
- Hey, Dad.
- You guys ready?

05:28.899 --> 05:30.815
- Shotgun.
- Hey. No way.

05:30.915 --> 05:32.597
Dad, we're giving Evan a ride home.

05:46.732 --> 05:48.832
- Hey, honey, you're on speakerphone.
- Hi, kids!

05:48.932 --> 05:51.632
- Hi, Mom! When are you coming back?
- Hi, Mom.

05:51.732 --> 05:54.526
I have a meeting in Kansas City tomorrow.
Hopefully the day after.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.906
I thought we were gonna finish
unpacking this week.

05:57.466 --> 06:00.400
Please, Michael,
let's not get into this right now.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.599
All right. Fine. I love you.

06:03.899 --> 06:05.765
- Gotta go.
- Bye, Mom.

06:05.865 --> 06:07.632
Bye.

06:11.232 --> 06:13.666
You liking it? Here? Shadow Canyon?

06:13.766 --> 06:17.766
- Yeah, I guess. It's different.
- From Berkeley? Yeah, I'll bet.

06:18.166 --> 06:22.832
You know, they say that moving is supposed
to be the third most stressful life event,

06:22.932 --> 06:25.049
after death and divorce, so...

06:37.936 --> 06:40.437
Hey, Evan... Ow!

06:40.537 --> 06:42.357
- Seriously? She kicked my seat.
- Girls, stop it.

06:42.457 --> 06:45.032
Well, mind your own business
and maybe I won't have to kick you.

06:45.132 --> 06:47.607
- Why are you being a jerk?
- She's being a jerk.

06:47.707 --> 06:51.033
- Cut it out, all right?
- You are! Just leave me alone!

07:07.832 --> 07:10.137
- Hey, Mr. Toomey.
- Hey, Stacey.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.466
I'm Stacey, she's Emma.

07:12.565 --> 07:15.566
Oh, shoot. It's gonna take me
a couple of minutes to get all that down.

07:15.666 --> 07:17.500
Well, it's easy to remember
I'm the pretty one.

07:18.010 --> 07:21.642
- Mr. Drakeford, thanks for the ride. Bye, Emma.
- Any time, Ev. Take care, bud.

07:22.268 --> 07:24.234
- Bye.
- Hey, Evan?

07:24.334 --> 07:27.065
Tell your dad I put
his pliers in the mailbox.

07:27.165 --> 07:30.383
- Uh, it's not my dad, but okay.
- Alan?

07:30.483 --> 07:32.491
I can't find my car keys.

07:32.591 --> 07:33.971
- Oh, hey, there.
- Hey.

07:34.071 --> 07:36.059
I better go before she has a breakdown.

07:36.159 --> 07:38.321
- Have a good one.
- All right. Bye-bye.

07:38.421 --> 07:40.629
Good luck.

07:52.465 --> 07:55.998
Stacey... what did I tell you
about texting at the table?

07:56.597 --> 07:58.465
Do you see me typing?

07:58.565 --> 08:01.260
I see you looking at your phone.

08:01.999 --> 08:04.723
Okay, you want to play "happy family"?

08:06.665 --> 08:09.221
How are things with Mom going?

08:15.103 --> 08:17.352
You're excused.

08:17.699 --> 08:19.183
Thanks.

08:24.481 --> 08:26.649
- You okay?
- Mmm.

08:26.749 --> 08:28.732
No, my mom's been, like, coughing in my face.

08:28.832 --> 08:31.888
- That sucks.
- Mm-hmm. All right, you should have it.

08:33.631 --> 08:37.419
- Okay, lady in an elevator.
- Shh. Watch.

08:40.166 --> 08:42.924
This is some Chinese shit.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.099
- Oh, my God. What's he doing?
- He just coughed blood on her.

08:47.199 --> 08:49.909
- Like, I feel like that's super rude.
- Is that real?

08:52.496 --> 08:53.985
Hold on.

08:54.085 --> 08:58.083
What are you doing? Emma, did you really
just leave me because I said I feel gross?

08:58.185 --> 09:00.260
Hang on.

09:03.032 --> 09:05.932
- Emma! Don't be a jerk friend.
- I gotta go.

09:06.032 --> 09:07.924
Emma!

09:28.182 --> 09:30.038
Crap.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.979
- Where are you going?
- I'll be back in a minute.

10:10.064 --> 10:11.966
Why are you calling me
when I'm three feet away?

10:12.066 --> 10:14.259
- Your note said to call you.
- Okay.

10:14.358 --> 10:16.932
Could we make this quick?
I'm on a really limited call plan.

10:17.032 --> 10:19.331
Oh. Yeah. Sure.

10:19.431 --> 10:22.465
Hello? Emma? She hung up on me.

10:24.331 --> 10:26.855
What have we got here?

10:27.200 --> 10:31.399
Hey, uh... Uh, Bill, this is Emma.
She lives right here.

10:31.499 --> 10:35.032
- We just... we live right here.
- It's nice to finally meet you, Emma.

10:35.132 --> 10:36.799
Likewise.

10:36.899 --> 10:39.431
Now I can see why Evan's
got a little spring in his step.

10:39.531 --> 10:44.664
- Okay, Bill. I'll be in in a minute.
- Ooh, looks like I'm getting the boot.

10:44.764 --> 10:47.848
Hey, now, don't go breaking
this little baby's heart, okay? He's...

10:47.948 --> 10:50.851
Look at him, ooh, he's sensitive.

10:54.965 --> 10:56.399
- He's a...
- Oh, an asshole.

10:56.499 --> 11:00.112
Yeah. Kind of, yeah.

11:08.899 --> 11:10.961
Good night.

11:14.829 --> 11:17.549
...officials do not believe there is
a threat to the United States,

11:17.649 --> 11:20.066
in spite of medical...

11:20.166 --> 11:23.257
- Good night, Dad.
- Night, sweetie.

11:24.798 --> 11:27.832
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

11:27.932 --> 11:30.635
Is everything okay with you and Mom?

11:33.082 --> 11:35.945
Things just seem pretty weird lately.

11:42.029 --> 11:43.435
I'm sorry.

11:43.535 --> 11:46.666
I get laid off, I go from teaching
PhD candidates to high school kids,

11:46.766 --> 11:49.312
and, no offense, it's just...

11:50.362 --> 11:54.149
I know it hasn't been easy
on you and your sister. Right?

11:54.398 --> 11:57.927
New school, new friends, new house.

12:01.032 --> 12:03.858
Things will be fine, sweetie, okay?

12:05.348 --> 12:08.916
- Yeah, I guess.
- Come here.

12:10.564 --> 12:14.291
- I love you, kiddo.
- I love you too.

12:14.391 --> 12:17.800
- Good night, sweetie.
- Good night.

12:19.799 --> 12:23.265
- Oh, that does hurt!
- Okay what is it on a scale?

12:23.365 --> 12:25.555
- What is it on a scale?
- It's just a six.

12:30.132 --> 12:32.797
- Nasty.
- Disgusting.

12:32.897 --> 12:34.599
I'm sorry, guys.

12:34.699 --> 12:40.271
The botfly larva is a multicellular parasite.
It's fairly easily removed, as you saw.

12:40.371 --> 12:42.799
And you just cover that breathing hole
with a piece of tape.

12:42.899 --> 12:45.859
Pokes its head up for some air. Pull it out.

12:46.373 --> 12:48.832
Ecuador 1987.

12:49.331 --> 12:52.133
Pulled that little guy out of my elbow.

12:52.232 --> 12:56.104
I don't know if any of you are following
the news. If you're not, you should be.

12:56.203 --> 12:58.578
There's something going around
that's making people sick.

12:58.678 --> 13:02.465
Most are now speculating
that it's parasitic, like this guy.

13:03.164 --> 13:06.053
Can anyone tell me what a parasite is?

13:06.665 --> 13:07.665
Yes, Evan.

13:07.765 --> 13:11.282
Um, it's, uh, an organism
that lives in another organism.

13:11.382 --> 13:14.032
Or on another organism, like head lice.

13:14.132 --> 13:16.647
Remember when you had head lice, Emma?

13:17.099 --> 13:19.399
I'm sorry.

13:20.003 --> 13:24.045
Anyway, look at this. Parasites, all right?

13:24.737 --> 13:27.869
These guys cannot survive on their own,
okay? They need a host.

13:30.868 --> 13:33.222
Sometimes they live peacefully
inside their hosts,

13:33.322 --> 13:36.131
but sometimes...
this is what fascinates me, guys...

13:36.231 --> 13:38.682
sometimes they take control,

13:38.782 --> 13:41.435
going so far as to manipulate their behavior.

13:41.535 --> 13:43.969
Toxoplasma gondii.

13:44.069 --> 13:47.032
This is a parasite
that gets inside of a rat's brain

13:47.131 --> 13:49.715
and makes the rat completely
fearless around cats.

13:50.219 --> 13:51.851
Why?

13:55.131 --> 13:58.599
Because Toxo only reproduces
in a cat's intestines.

13:58.699 --> 14:01.700
So the cat eats the rat,
and the cycle then begins again.

14:01.800 --> 14:07.372
Is it like how zombies are always biting
people to turn them into more zombies?

14:08.632 --> 14:12.565
Know what? It's kind of.
I mean, the question being...

14:12.665 --> 14:16.544
when does a host stop being an animal...

14:16.644 --> 14:20.402
- and simply become a vehicle...
- Gracie. Are you okay?

14:20.502 --> 14:23.316
...with about as much control
as an airplane over a pilot.

14:23.416 --> 14:25.632
- This is always for the greater good.
- Are you okay?

14:25.732 --> 14:29.687
It's always in the name
of reproduction, of proliferation.

14:33.832 --> 14:38.217
Now this parasite that we're dealing with
overseas is most likely single-cell.

14:49.565 --> 14:51.429
Gracie!

15:04.765 --> 15:07.228
Hey, have you seen a girl?

15:08.065 --> 15:09.799
Gracie!

15:09.899 --> 15:11.763
Gracie?

15:24.898 --> 15:26.779
Gracie?

15:28.265 --> 15:30.039
Gracie?

15:42.565 --> 15:44.628
Gracie?

15:48.832 --> 15:51.565
Gracie. Gracie.

15:51.665 --> 15:54.715
Oh, my God. Help!

15:55.164 --> 15:57.321
Help me!

15:57.421 --> 15:58.866
- What happened?
- I don't know.

15:58.966 --> 16:00.419
- What's her name?
- Gracie.

16:00.519 --> 16:02.757
Gracie, hey.

16:04.198 --> 16:06.090
Gracie?

16:09.163 --> 16:10.570
Gracie?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.905
Get help. Go get the nurse.

16:17.799 --> 16:19.404
You're okay.

16:26.898 --> 16:30.107
Somebody help! Help!

16:33.532 --> 16:37.365
Over here, straight. Open your mouth.

16:37.465 --> 16:39.950
Look up. Up.

16:40.565 --> 16:43.742
Great. And, Emma...

16:43.842 --> 16:48.158
do you know if Gracie
has been exposed to any livestock?

16:49.732 --> 16:51.298
I don't think so.

16:51.398 --> 16:55.595
Do you know if she's come into contact
with anyone who's traveled internationally?

16:57.265 --> 17:00.465
Her mom got back
from San Francisco this weekend.

17:00.565 --> 17:04.916
Okay, and did Gracie mention anything
about not feeling well?

17:07.365 --> 17:10.328
Last night, she said that her throat hurt.

17:11.931 --> 17:15.517
This morning, when I saw her
she looked pretty sick.

17:16.232 --> 17:18.994
Did she describe any other symptoms?

17:20.632 --> 17:22.298
Yesterday she said she was really hungry

17:22.397 --> 17:24.931
but I didn't think there was
anything weird about that.

17:25.031 --> 17:29.690
Okay. Did any of her discharge
enter your nose or mouth?

17:29.790 --> 17:30.776
No.

17:30.876 --> 17:34.115
...department has just instructed us
to cancel classes for today.

17:34.215 --> 17:36.111
Now this is just a precaution...

17:36.211 --> 17:39.098
No. No, it was one
of the other girls in the class.

17:39.198 --> 17:42.498
- Where is she?
- Hang on. She's fine.

17:42.598 --> 17:45.365
- Honey, she's fine, I'm telling you.
- Mom, I'm fine.

17:45.465 --> 17:49.323
See? She's fine.
What about you? What's going on?

17:50.265 --> 17:52.065
Nothing?

17:52.951 --> 17:55.065
- There's no cabs?
- Stacey.

17:55.165 --> 17:58.257
Oh, that's sick. We need one of those.

17:59.531 --> 18:01.715
They're checking all the cars
that are leaving town.

18:01.815 --> 18:04.477
All right, guys, look, Mom's stuck
at the airport. She can't get a taxi.

18:04.577 --> 18:08.398
I'm gonna go pick her up. I want the two
of you to go straight home, you got it?

18:08.498 --> 18:11.032
How are we supposed to get there?

18:31.709 --> 18:33.098
- Hey.
- Hey, Gracie...

18:33.198 --> 18:36.964
Gotcha, you're talking to a machine.
Leave a message. Bye.

18:38.598 --> 18:43.331
Hey, Gracie, it's me, it's Emma. Um...
Look, I'm really worried about you, okay?

18:43.431 --> 18:47.290
So please just give me a call back
when you get this. Bye.

20:08.830 --> 20:12.731
- Hi, Dad.
- Girls, I can't get back into town.

20:12.831 --> 20:14.899
- What?
- They've closed all the roads.

20:14.999 --> 20:18.207
- Well, where's Mom? Is she with you?
- No, she's not.

20:18.307 --> 20:21.764
She's still at the airport because
they're not letting people in the area, okay?

20:21.864 --> 20:26.014
- What's going on? Where are you?
- I'm at the store on route 26.

20:26.114 --> 20:28.548
A bunch of us are waiting here.

20:28.648 --> 20:32.564
Girls, listen to me, this is important.
The whole county's under quarantine.

20:32.664 --> 20:34.422
- What does that mean?
- Means we're fucked.

20:34.522 --> 20:37.232
Stacey. It means that this thing
is serious enough

20:37.332 --> 20:39.076
they don't want anybody
going in or out of town.

20:39.176 --> 20:41.731
Now I'm gonna head back to the airport
and try and get your mom, okay?

20:41.831 --> 20:44.055
- I'll be back as soon as I can.
- Okay.

20:44.155 --> 20:48.665
- Listen, promise me two things, okay?
- Yeah, what?

20:48.764 --> 20:52.098
- No fighting and no boys over.
- Yeah.

20:52.198 --> 20:55.398
- Say it, promise.
- Yes, promise. Bye, Dad.

20:55.498 --> 20:58.098
Okay, bye. I love you.

21:30.231 --> 21:33.380
I can't order pizza. The Web site's on crack.

21:33.480 --> 21:35.147
Oh, boy.

21:35.247 --> 21:37.774
We could have Great Grains cereal

21:37.874 --> 21:40.331
mixed with meat-flavored pasta sauce.

21:40.431 --> 21:43.794
See, this is what happens when Mom leaves us.

21:44.615 --> 21:47.149
Mayonnaise could be useful.

21:49.545 --> 21:52.031
Brownies? For dinner?

21:52.331 --> 21:55.452
Uh, despite, obviously
the extraordinary pain and hardship,

21:55.552 --> 21:58.352
uh, of the families and persons
who've been affected,

21:58.452 --> 22:01.399
and despite the fact that we have
to take this very seriously,

22:01.499 --> 22:05.465
it is important to remind ourselves
this is not an airborne disease.

22:05.565 --> 22:08.192
This is one that can be controlled

22:08.292 --> 22:12.718
and contained very effectively
if we use the right protocols.

22:12.818 --> 22:16.630
- What are you doing? I was watching that.
- It was boring and depressing.

22:32.697 --> 22:36.133
Stacey, did you hear that? Sta...

22:53.664 --> 22:55.550
Hello?

23:03.821 --> 23:05.627
Hello?

23:21.381 --> 23:23.313
- Stacey!
- What?

23:23.413 --> 23:25.222
- Someone's standing at the front door.
- Who?

23:25.322 --> 23:27.969
I don't know! Come on.

23:28.998 --> 23:31.854
I'm telling you, I saw someone out there.

23:36.164 --> 23:39.397
Don't just open the door. Stacey!

23:45.664 --> 23:47.928
See? Nobody there.

23:55.564 --> 23:57.848
Oh, my God!
I think you both just shit your pants.

23:57.948 --> 23:59.951
How did you even sneak in here with crutches?

24:00.051 --> 24:02.972
'Cause I'm a ninja with the hide-a-key.

24:04.930 --> 24:08.098
- You know there is a curfew.
- I don't even know what a curfew is.

24:08.198 --> 24:11.798
- Stacey. Dad said that...
- He says a lot of things. Hi.

24:11.898 --> 24:15.098
- Okay.
- Uh-oh. Mm-mm.

24:15.198 --> 24:18.133
You want to get some of this,
you got to beat me upstairs.

24:18.233 --> 24:21.337
Aw, that's so sad
that you can't walk like a human.

24:38.198 --> 24:40.665
This whole worm flu thing
is worse than the president

24:40.765 --> 24:42.831
and CDC are willing to admit.

24:42.931 --> 24:46.131
Since when does the flu
make you want to attack people?

24:46.231 --> 24:49.224
That doesn't sound like the flu to me.

24:53.864 --> 24:57.324
And plus, you can't just quarantine
half the state of California

24:57.424 --> 25:00.371
and not declare martial law.
That's unconstitutional.

25:00.470 --> 25:02.604
Hey, Obama, you can quarantine my...

25:30.698 --> 25:33.190
What is all this?

25:35.531 --> 25:38.058
Hey, Bill, what's going on?

25:50.898 --> 25:52.725
Stacey!

26:07.265 --> 26:10.864
- Boring. Band-Aid. Boring.
- Ow!

26:11.713 --> 26:14.980
- What's this?
- That's a flare. Be careful.

26:15.130 --> 26:18.597
- Okay.
- Oh, my God.

26:18.697 --> 26:21.779
"Warning: If you come in contact
with someone who exhibits symptoms,

26:21.879 --> 26:26.198
"please notify the CDC or your local
authorities via the web site listed below

26:26.298 --> 26:30.718
- "or contact the CDC hotline."
- Domo arigato.

26:33.097 --> 26:35.864
- Are we supposed to wear these?
- I think so. Why are you doing The Robot?

26:35.964 --> 26:38.931
- Did you just kill yourself?
- I am so Asian right now.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.806
That's not racist at all.

26:40.906 --> 26:44.534
- You're so serious. Lighten up.
- It is serious, Stacey. Look at this stuff.

26:44.634 --> 26:46.521
- Look at this, huh?
- It's a flashlight.

26:46.621 --> 26:48.815
Yeah, but it winds up.

26:51.826 --> 26:54.081
- Hey, Mom.
- Is that your mom?

26:54.181 --> 26:56.448
No, no, we're okay. Yeah, it's just us.

26:56.548 --> 26:59.730
- Where is she?
- Where are you?

26:59.830 --> 27:04.107
She's still at the airport. We're fine.

27:06.931 --> 27:10.231
- O-M-G.
- What?

27:10.330 --> 27:13.230
Beef taco filling in a box in a bag.

27:13.329 --> 27:14.834
What's your IQ?

27:16.446 --> 27:20.165
"Don't worry, trust the CDC."
But, I mean, patients are going missing.

27:20.265 --> 27:25.313
This is crazy! I... Infected people,
under hospital care...

27:29.430 --> 27:32.697
- Oh, this is delicious.
- Good.

27:33.696 --> 27:37.202
Try not to eat it all, okay?
It's all we've got.

27:37.901 --> 27:40.932
This is very very alarming...

27:44.265 --> 27:47.764
- Is that my phone?
- Mm-hmm. You left it upstairs.

27:48.398 --> 27:50.628
Why do you look so nice?

27:50.728 --> 27:52.955
- There's a party in Phase Two tonight.
- You do look nice.

27:53.055 --> 27:54.848
- Thank you.
- We can't leave the house.

27:54.948 --> 27:56.631
We're alone, Emma,
we can do whatever we want.

27:56.731 --> 27:58.534
It's not cool, Stacey.
There's still a curfew.

27:58.634 --> 28:02.735
What's not cool is doing your homework in
dirty sweats when there's no school tomorrow.

28:02.835 --> 28:06.765
- This is true. Cheers.
- Cheers.

28:08.463 --> 28:10.998
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks. You, too.

28:11.098 --> 28:13.361
I will.

28:20.065 --> 28:21.919
What?

28:23.498 --> 28:25.403
Oh, my God, what a bitch.

28:38.698 --> 28:41.079
Oh, balls.

29:10.497 --> 29:12.891
I'll see you around.

29:14.430 --> 29:16.231
Hey!

29:16.780 --> 29:18.631
Hi.

29:19.630 --> 29:21.864
Are you wearing makeup?

29:21.964 --> 29:25.018
Um, yeah, like, a little bit, it's...

29:25.778 --> 29:28.064
It was Stacey's, I...

29:28.164 --> 29:30.898
- Oh.
- Do I look like a hooker?

29:31.597 --> 29:34.831
Yeah, but, like, a really high-class hooker.

29:34.931 --> 29:36.526
Okay.

29:36.626 --> 29:39.381
- Want to dance?
- Cool.

29:49.114 --> 29:51.535
You're a bad dancer!

30:05.697 --> 30:07.964
- Wha... what's in it?
- Tequila.

30:08.064 --> 30:11.144
- And what else?
- More tequila.

30:12.197 --> 30:14.864
- Hey.
- Okay.

30:16.931 --> 30:20.354
- Where's CJ?
- I don't know.

30:21.031 --> 30:22.916
Asshole.

30:23.297 --> 30:25.159
See ya.

30:59.397 --> 31:02.058
I'm glad one of us came prepared.

31:02.898 --> 31:06.198
- Shall we?
- After you.

31:17.574 --> 31:19.037
I'm sorry. Sorry.

31:19.136 --> 31:21.416
Oh, my God!

31:23.230 --> 31:25.398
What a slut.

31:25.498 --> 31:27.957
Um... different room?

31:29.164 --> 31:32.651
- Anyone in here?
- Put your penis away. Okay.

31:39.163 --> 31:42.532
Ah! Too bright. Not pretty.

31:43.231 --> 31:45.674
- Better?
- Yeah.

31:55.263 --> 31:57.085
Cool.

32:03.397 --> 32:05.752
Okey, dokey.

32:14.797 --> 32:17.896
- What are we doing?
- We're having a moment.

32:19.508 --> 32:22.934
- Why are you whispering?
- I don't know. Why are you?

32:31.964 --> 32:34.025
I like you.

32:40.764 --> 32:43.865
- What the hell is that?
- Stacey, wait!

32:44.564 --> 32:48.931
Stay the hell away from me or I'll take that
sweatshirt and shove it so far up your ass.

32:49.030 --> 32:51.881
You don't even... What the hell was that?

32:51.980 --> 32:54.760
- What happened to your bra?
- They're not worth it. They're not worth it.

32:54.860 --> 32:57.383
- Get off of me! All right.
- Piece of shit.

32:57.483 --> 33:00.089
Baby. Baby!

33:02.531 --> 33:05.331
- Stacey, wait, Stacey. This is so lame.
- I need a drink.

33:05.431 --> 33:08.004
I really don't think you should care.

33:08.104 --> 33:09.956
Emma?

33:13.898 --> 33:15.698
Emma?

33:16.631 --> 33:18.464
Whoa!

33:19.213 --> 33:21.477
Oh, my...

33:27.997 --> 33:29.832
Hey!

33:31.330 --> 33:33.824
Yo, I'm talking to you!

33:35.570 --> 33:38.340
Dude, hello.

33:41.929 --> 33:44.497
Whoa! Let her go!

33:45.898 --> 33:47.976
I'm talking to you!

33:48.076 --> 33:50.317
Answer me!

33:54.027 --> 33:57.531
I know he's a piece of shit, for two
seconds, I thought she was actually...

33:59.562 --> 34:01.753
He's infected!

34:01.853 --> 34:04.526
- Stacey!
- Not in here. Come on.

34:07.931 --> 34:11.029
- Get out of here! Come on!
- What's going on?

34:12.563 --> 34:15.121
Stacey, what's wrong with him?

34:19.880 --> 34:21.723
Okay.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.722
Oh, my God.

36:06.410 --> 36:08.278
Shit.

36:23.297 --> 36:25.603
Is he gone?

36:30.917 --> 36:32.472
Stacey!

36:50.830 --> 36:53.979
Stacey? Did it get in your eyes?

36:54.079 --> 36:58.118
Are you okay? Okay. Come on.

37:16.797 --> 37:19.263
Hey, Stace, you okay?

37:19.363 --> 37:21.227
Yeah.

37:24.797 --> 37:27.283
I'll be out in a minute.

37:28.364 --> 37:31.573
Why isn't anyone talking about
the fact that all these infected attacks

37:31.673 --> 37:34.730
started happening at the exact
same time, all over the world?

37:34.830 --> 37:38.797
It's like the infected are communicating on
some secret network that only they can hear.

37:38.897 --> 37:41.498
Now there are reports
of these gatherings of infected,

37:41.598 --> 37:44.063
and these nests across the country.

37:44.163 --> 37:46.631
What I'd like to know is
what the hell are they up to

37:46.730 --> 37:49.773
and why isn't the government doing...

38:49.897 --> 38:52.928
You had any contact with an infected person?

38:56.596 --> 38:58.421
No.

39:30.230 --> 39:32.617
Banished are the sounds of children playing,

39:32.717 --> 39:35.361
as the uninfected cower in their homes.

39:35.461 --> 39:37.498
Civilian military stretched too thin.

39:37.697 --> 39:42.397
A crude symbol, increasingly prevalent,
indicates which homes have been cleared,

39:42.497 --> 39:46.098
and those which still need to be
inspected. Streets so quiet...

39:46.198 --> 39:50.761
- I keep getting his voicemail. Mom's, too.
- ...the uninfected cowering at home.

39:50.861 --> 39:53.630
An innocuous letter...
an uppercase "I"... holds the key

39:53.730 --> 39:56.464
- to the fate of the families within....
- Hey, are you okay?

39:56.563 --> 39:59.547
The number on the left
indicates the number of infected.

39:59.647 --> 40:03.398
The number on the right indicates the members
of the household who have been removed.

40:03.498 --> 40:06.031
It's him. Hey, Dad.

40:06.131 --> 40:08.864
Girls, listen to me very carefully.

40:08.964 --> 40:12.163
Lock every window
and every door in that house.

40:12.263 --> 40:15.790
Nobody in, nobody out.
Do you understand? Stacey?

40:16.130 --> 40:17.968
I'm here.

40:18.068 --> 40:20.951
- Do you remember where my gun is?
- Yeah.

40:21.051 --> 40:24.664
I want you to find it and keep it on you
at all times. Do you understand?

40:24.764 --> 40:26.779
Do you un...

40:26.897 --> 40:28.730
Dad?

40:29.829 --> 40:32.256
- There's no reception.
- Try him again.

40:34.498 --> 40:36.946
Dad, are you there?

40:37.446 --> 40:39.794
24 hours ago, military personnel...

40:39.894 --> 40:42.097
- Well, try again.
- ...evacuated the uninfected...

40:42.197 --> 40:45.406
Dad, hello? Are you there?

40:45.505 --> 40:47.331
Dad?

40:49.087 --> 40:52.160
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

40:54.330 --> 40:56.318
The land line's out, too.

40:56.418 --> 40:58.719
Power still works.

41:00.080 --> 41:02.282
There's no Wi-Fi.

41:03.630 --> 41:06.496
Attention: This is not a test.

41:06.596 --> 41:10.179
This emergency alert has been issued
by the Center for Disease Control,

41:10.279 --> 41:13.130
in conjunction with the Department
of Public Health.

41:13.230 --> 41:17.056
The president of the United States
has declared martial law.

41:17.156 --> 41:22.682
All law enforcement and emergency personnel
will be federalized, effective immediately.

41:30.696 --> 41:34.049
I know it's somewhere in here.

41:40.429 --> 41:43.152
Can you please help me look?

41:44.479 --> 41:47.649
- What? It's a ring.
- It's Mom's wedding ring...

41:47.749 --> 41:50.128
that she never takes off.

41:50.228 --> 41:52.663
She probably showered
and forgot to put it back on.

41:52.763 --> 41:54.730
Will you please tell me what's going on?

41:54.830 --> 41:57.211
- Nothing is going on.
- Stacey, Mom and Dad...

41:57.311 --> 42:00.565
There's nothing to talk about,
so let's drop it.

42:01.697 --> 42:02.922
Fine.

42:20.163 --> 42:22.980
Where did you learn how to do that?

42:23.080 --> 42:25.447
Dad used to take me to the range.

42:25.547 --> 42:27.403
Oh.

43:02.113 --> 43:04.375
Come on, come on.

43:20.297 --> 43:21.997
Hey! Over here!

43:22.097 --> 43:26.503
Sir, stay where you are. We're here to help.

43:26.603 --> 43:29.347
- What was that?
- I don't know.

43:29.597 --> 43:33.254
Stay back. Stay right there.

43:36.018 --> 43:37.963
- Get back.
- It's Mrs. Toomey.

43:38.063 --> 43:42.463
Get down on the ground.
Get down on the ground now! Get down!

43:42.963 --> 43:45.864
- Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
- Turn around!

43:46.363 --> 43:49.862
- I'm not infected! I'm not infected!
- Don't move!

44:09.463 --> 44:11.447
We have to get out of here.

44:56.997 --> 44:58.853
Evan!

45:37.496 --> 45:39.830
This is a restricted quarantine zone.

45:39.930 --> 45:42.693
Turn your vehicle around immediately.

45:44.427 --> 45:46.898
- Stacey we gotta turn around.
- Stay here.

45:46.998 --> 45:49.196
- Turn around. Stacey what are you doing?
- Ma'am.

45:49.296 --> 45:52.303
- Get back in the car! Stacey!
- Get back in your vehicle, now.

45:52.403 --> 45:54.397
- Sir, we're just trying to see our dad.
- Stop, now!

45:54.497 --> 45:57.530
- Ma'am, get back in your vehicle!
- Go right there... Please, sir.

45:57.630 --> 46:00.730
What part of "get back in your vehicle"
did you not understand?

46:00.830 --> 46:04.798
Get back in your vehicle now!
Ma'am! Ma'am, right now!

46:04.898 --> 46:07.530
- We're just trying to get right there.
- Right now!

46:08.410 --> 46:11.155
- Stacey!
- Get back in your vehicle now...

46:15.897 --> 46:17.602
Shit.

46:25.463 --> 46:28.353
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

46:46.030 --> 46:48.668
...you are required to stay in your home.

46:48.768 --> 46:53.497
By executive order it is now a felony
to harbor an infected individual.

46:53.597 --> 46:57.397
Please report any suspected
infection immediately.

46:57.497 --> 47:00.951
Attention: You are required
to stay in your home.

47:01.051 --> 47:05.563
By executive order it is now a felony
to harbor an infected individual.

47:05.663 --> 47:09.651
Please report any suspected
infection immediately.

47:10.097 --> 47:13.529
Attention: You are required
to stay in your homes.

47:13.629 --> 47:16.550
By executive order
it is now a felony to harbor...

48:13.195 --> 48:15.353
I need to tell you something.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.519
Okay.

48:25.295 --> 48:27.084
What?

48:32.296 --> 48:34.164
Dad cheated on Mom.

48:36.013 --> 48:37.813
What?

48:38.556 --> 48:40.863
Last semester
when I went to visit him at work,

48:40.963 --> 48:44.397
I walked in on him
with one of his grad students.

48:45.096 --> 48:47.234
And I freaked out.

48:49.146 --> 48:52.170
So I told Mom and Mom freaked out.

48:54.763 --> 48:57.548
Well, why didn't anyone tell me?

48:58.697 --> 49:01.319
They didn't think that you could handle it.

49:01.419 --> 49:05.947
And they begged me not to say anything.
That's why we moved out here, to start over.

49:06.196 --> 49:08.530
Looks like that didn't go so well.

49:09.779 --> 49:12.272
You should've told me sooner.

49:12.996 --> 49:16.163
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

49:16.263 --> 49:19.589
And that's why I've been such a bitch,
I've just been so pissed.

49:21.430 --> 49:25.579
- And you could've handled it.
- I can handle it, Stacey.

49:30.663 --> 49:32.397
Stacey?

49:33.296 --> 49:36.089
Emma! Open the door!

49:36.189 --> 49:38.973
Emma! Open the door!

49:39.073 --> 49:40.632
- Emma, don't.
- It's Evan, Stacey!

49:40.732 --> 49:43.864
You don't know if he's infected or not!
Emma, don't...

49:44.313 --> 49:47.250
- What's wrong?
- He's infected.

49:47.350 --> 49:49.214
Who?

50:15.196 --> 50:17.687
I'm gonna get the masks.

50:20.329 --> 50:22.593
Is he gone?

50:26.563 --> 50:29.361
Emma... don't.

50:50.396 --> 50:52.100
Get the lights.

50:52.200 --> 50:55.427
It doesn't matter,
he can't see anything anymore.

51:02.079 --> 51:04.365
Don't move.

51:05.996 --> 51:08.456
Put your masks on.

51:45.962 --> 51:48.563
He's right out there.

53:32.979 --> 53:35.275
Are you... You're okay.

53:35.375 --> 53:38.729
You're okay. It didn't get on you,
it didn't get on you. You're okay.

53:43.296 --> 53:46.963
Stacey. Oh, my God. Stacey.

53:47.063 --> 53:49.575
Sta... Stacey?

53:51.396 --> 53:53.282
Stacey.

53:53.582 --> 53:55.470
Stacey!

54:12.696 --> 54:14.979
Emma!

54:17.429 --> 54:19.397
Emma!

54:19.497 --> 54:21.497
This isn't gonna work.

54:21.597 --> 54:25.417
What? No, I won't feed her.
You said it only grew when he ate.

54:25.517 --> 54:28.180
Maybe you can slow it down,
but you can't stop this thing.

54:28.370 --> 54:31.063
It takes over your body
and it turns you into something else.

54:31.163 --> 54:32.869
Emma!

54:32.969 --> 54:34.530
Emma!

54:34.630 --> 54:38.129
Look... you can go, if you want to.

54:38.229 --> 54:39.913
- It's okay.
- Emma!

54:40.629 --> 54:43.121
I'm not gonna leave her.

54:49.530 --> 54:52.783
How are we gonna make sure
they don't check the house again?

54:57.696 --> 55:00.455
What if they thought we were already gone?

55:54.162 --> 55:56.762
This is UF-6 entering sector five.

55:56.862 --> 56:01.245
North 47-52-0-6 east...

56:02.157 --> 56:04.413
Looks like there's no one here.

56:04.513 --> 56:06.964
Emma!

56:09.362 --> 56:11.163
Emma!

56:11.832 --> 56:14.830
Emma, please! I'm hungry, please!

56:14.930 --> 56:19.063
- Yeah, Stace, it's me.
- Emma, I'm so hungry.

56:19.163 --> 56:21.996
- So hungry.
- I know you are.

56:23.395 --> 56:28.063
I can feel it inside of me, behind
my eyes, telling me to do things.

56:28.163 --> 56:30.424
You've got to fight it, Stace.

56:30.524 --> 56:32.562
You have to leave.

56:33.347 --> 56:35.760
Emma, please leave.

56:38.216 --> 56:40.957
- Leave.
- No.

56:43.163 --> 56:45.863
You remember when we were little...

56:46.562 --> 56:51.286
and I came home from school crying because
Katie Moore cut off one of my pigtails?

56:51.386 --> 56:53.264
Remember?

56:53.364 --> 56:56.425
- Yeah.
- And the next day...

56:57.728 --> 57:01.128
you made her eat her boogers
in front of everyone.

57:01.228 --> 57:03.976
It seemed like an appropriate
punishment at the time.

57:11.396 --> 57:14.463
That's what we do. We protect each other.

57:14.562 --> 57:18.716
'Cause... 'cause Dad's
gonna come home soon. Okay?

57:19.895 --> 57:21.725
Okay.

58:21.795 --> 58:24.624
Hey. Anything?

58:26.596 --> 58:29.063
How are you holding up?

58:33.490 --> 58:36.453
Haven't seen anybody around in a while.

58:42.296 --> 58:45.344
I'm never gonna see my dad again.

58:45.443 --> 58:48.463
- My mom.
- You don't know that.

58:49.263 --> 58:50.963
Yes, I do.

58:52.262 --> 58:54.655
I have a feeling.

59:00.363 --> 59:02.396
You know...

59:03.495 --> 59:05.997
I lost my mom a couple years ago.

59:06.097 --> 59:08.096
She had cancer.

59:08.196 --> 59:12.296
I watched her turn into something
that I didn't even recognize, you know?

59:12.395 --> 59:15.129
It was like I was the parent
and she was the kid.

59:15.229 --> 59:17.930
And Bill... he checked out, so...

59:18.929 --> 59:21.728
it was just me there.

59:21.828 --> 59:24.918
Every day and every night. And, um...

59:25.018 --> 59:26.830
sometimes...

59:28.728 --> 59:31.562
I wish I could see her...

59:31.879 --> 59:33.862
remember her...

59:33.962 --> 59:37.498
more for what she was
instead of what she became.

59:37.928 --> 59:39.928
You know?

59:40.078 --> 59:42.552
I'm so sorry.

59:43.561 --> 59:46.296
- I can't leave her.
- I know.

59:46.395 --> 59:49.395
She's the only thing that I have left now.

59:49.495 --> 59:52.496
I can't leave her. Please don't make me.

59:52.596 --> 59:54.662
I won't.

01:00:23.263 --> 01:00:25.127
Hello?

01:00:28.263 --> 01:00:30.130
Yo!

01:00:47.528 --> 01:00:48.562
Stacey?

01:00:52.828 --> 01:00:54.712
Stacey!

01:00:55.212 --> 01:00:59.391
The Army split.
A bunch of us are getting out of town.

01:01:00.263 --> 01:01:02.127
Stacey!

01:01:11.928 --> 01:01:13.929
Help.

01:01:14.029 --> 01:01:16.026
Stacey?

01:01:18.029 --> 01:01:20.428
The fuck...

01:01:22.662 --> 01:01:24.454
What... what happened?

01:01:24.554 --> 01:01:27.478
They're infected. They locked me in here.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:29.412
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:01:29.512 --> 01:01:34.130
Please help me. Please, I need you.
Please help me.

01:01:35.428 --> 01:01:37.600
- I'm gonna get you out of here.
- I'm so scared.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.117
- I'll get you out of here.
- Please, please.

01:01:41.629 --> 01:01:43.493
Please.

01:01:46.595 --> 01:01:48.395
You really hurt me, CJ.

01:01:48.495 --> 01:01:51.533
Baby, I know. I'm sorry. That's why I came.

01:02:13.508 --> 01:02:15.792
I'm sorry.

01:02:19.112 --> 01:02:21.452
I'm sorry. It made me do it.

01:02:21.962 --> 01:02:25.316
I can't stop it from changing me. Please.

01:02:26.315 --> 01:02:28.933
Please. Please.

01:02:52.796 --> 01:02:55.517
Your sister's keeping me busy.

01:02:56.362 --> 01:02:57.729
Emma, this is nuts.

01:02:57.829 --> 01:03:01.396
It's a multicellular parasite, Evan.
That means it can be removed.

01:03:01.496 --> 01:03:05.356
Em, trust me, somebody already tried this.
It won't work.

01:03:06.295 --> 01:03:08.720
You're gonna kill her.

01:03:09.662 --> 01:03:12.002
She's already dead.

01:03:12.351 --> 01:03:14.120
I'm gonna save her.

01:04:03.893 --> 01:04:05.445
Thank you.

01:04:12.745 --> 01:04:14.999
Take my hand.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:20.584
No, it's gonna make me hurt you.

01:04:20.684 --> 01:04:23.885
You wouldn't hurt me, Stacey. Take it.

01:05:00.929 --> 01:05:03.396
Em, promise me something.

01:05:04.245 --> 01:05:06.074
Anything.

01:05:07.628 --> 01:05:10.128
If I don't make it...

01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:13.696
you find Dad.

01:05:14.795 --> 01:05:17.495
And tell him I'm sorry.

01:05:17.912 --> 01:05:20.388
And I love him.

01:05:23.695 --> 01:05:25.896
Listen to me.

01:05:27.083 --> 01:05:31.840
You are gonna see him.
And you can tell him yourself.

01:05:32.912 --> 01:05:35.412
29, sir. Sector 76.

01:05:35.512 --> 01:05:38.078
I have a setting for reference one-zero.

01:05:39.127 --> 01:05:41.328
She's asleep.

01:05:41.428 --> 01:05:44.000
How much did you give her?

01:07:06.462 --> 01:07:08.316
Ugh...

01:08:01.829 --> 01:08:04.090
It can't breathe.

01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:15.780
Oh, God!

01:08:20.761 --> 01:08:23.151
Oh, no...

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:55.264
Stacey? Stacey, it's okay.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:58.069
Listen to me, it's gone. Stacey?

01:08:59.578 --> 01:09:01.578
It's gone.

01:09:02.462 --> 01:09:05.162
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:08.312
It's gone, it's gone.

01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:12.002
By order of the Governor of California,

01:09:12.103 --> 01:09:16.209
Shadow Canyon is under
a mandatory evacuation order.

01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:21.446
Any remaining residents must evacuate
their homes and report to military...

01:09:23.026 --> 01:09:26.560
- They want us to report.
- We can't. They'll take her.

01:09:41.627 --> 01:09:43.862
Hey, bitch.

01:09:46.609 --> 01:09:48.618
Come on.

01:09:49.328 --> 01:09:52.629
All right.
Got some really gross soup for you.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:54.861
What is this? MRE shit?

01:09:54.961 --> 01:09:57.202
- It's all we've got. Sorry.
- Looks like piss.

01:09:57.302 --> 01:10:00.687
Yeah, well... I'm sure it tastes
like it, too.

01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:06.019
Oh, God, it looks so much better.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:11.262
- Are you sure it's okay to eat?
- Yeah. It's gone.

01:10:20.994 --> 01:10:23.006
You guys do it yet?

01:10:23.106 --> 01:10:26.106
- What?
- You and Evan?

01:10:27.928 --> 01:10:32.724
Um, we've been a little preoccupied.
No, haven't really had time to get naked.

01:10:36.195 --> 01:10:38.346
Thank you.

01:10:38.446 --> 01:10:40.504
You're welcome.

01:10:41.395 --> 01:10:43.752
I couldn't have done what you did.

01:10:47.011 --> 01:10:49.340
You're my big sister.

01:11:01.161 --> 01:11:04.563
Two residences in Sector 14
showing nest activity.

01:11:04.663 --> 01:11:07.162
Request permission to go hot.

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:31.374
Emma, come here!

01:12:34.127 --> 01:12:36.073
What?

01:12:36.173 --> 01:12:38.854
Everything is gone.

01:12:48.529 --> 01:12:50.328
Stacey!

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.995
Stacey, wait!

01:12:53.195 --> 01:12:56.618
- Emma! Emma, she's gone!
- Stacey!

01:13:05.754 --> 01:13:07.349
Stacey?

01:13:09.245 --> 01:13:13.362
- Please don't go in there.
- I can't leave without her.

01:13:46.181 --> 01:13:49.696
Oh, my God. God.

01:13:53.761 --> 01:13:55.978
Emma. Emma.

01:14:20.995 --> 01:14:22.856
No.

01:15:04.161 --> 01:15:05.984
Stacey?

01:16:00.694 --> 01:16:03.527
Run! Come on!

01:16:16.817 --> 01:16:20.328
This way! Come on!

01:16:20.637 --> 01:16:22.713
Oh, shit.

01:16:24.594 --> 01:16:27.421
Come on. Here.

01:16:30.578 --> 01:16:32.095
Shoot him!

01:16:39.261 --> 01:16:41.042
Stacey?

01:16:43.595 --> 01:16:45.397
Stacey.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:48.064
I can hear them,

01:16:48.164 --> 01:16:51.196
telling me what they want to do to you.

01:16:52.113 --> 01:16:53.595
To everyone.

01:16:54.494 --> 01:16:56.495
- I can't make it stop.
- Emma. Emma!

01:16:56.595 --> 01:16:58.992
- Please make it stop.
- I can't.

01:16:59.092 --> 01:17:00.528
- Emma, please!
- Emma.

01:17:00.628 --> 01:17:03.495
- Stacey, I can't!
- Emma, kill me, please!

01:17:03.595 --> 01:17:05.595
- Emma, please.
- No!

01:17:05.695 --> 01:17:07.395
Please.

01:17:07.495 --> 01:17:09.748
Please, I don't want to hurt you. Please.

01:17:11.299 --> 01:17:13.661
- Emma, I need you to help me.
- Stacey.

01:17:13.981 --> 01:17:15.801
Emma.

01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.302
Emma!

01:17:18.402 --> 01:17:20.536
Stacey.

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:23.838
- Stacey stop...
- I can't hold it!

01:17:52.845 --> 01:17:54.711
Stacey.

01:17:55.061 --> 01:17:57.987
Emma, let's go! Stand up!

01:17:58.087 --> 01:18:00.042
Come on.

01:18:02.028 --> 01:18:03.992
Climb out. Climb out!

01:18:04.092 --> 01:18:06.294
- Emma...
- I can't.

01:18:06.394 --> 01:18:08.895
- She's gone. Come on. Let's go.
- I can't!

01:18:08.995 --> 01:18:10.774
Get up! This...

01:18:10.874 --> 01:18:14.012
Up, up, up, up.

01:18:21.243 --> 01:18:23.360
We gotta go.

01:18:35.752 --> 01:18:38.257
Emma! Jump! Now! Get down here!

01:18:47.670 --> 01:18:49.945
Gotta jump. One...

01:18:50.045 --> 01:18:51.853
two...

01:18:52.252 --> 01:18:54.062
three!

01:20:43.952 --> 01:20:46.986
- Where is that?
- In Washington State.

01:20:47.086 --> 01:20:49.534
Let's do it.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.486
Hey.

01:21:12.816 --> 01:21:15.447
- Thanks.
- For what?

01:21:17.386 --> 01:21:19.231
Just for being here.

01:21:20.986 --> 01:21:23.273
Of course.
