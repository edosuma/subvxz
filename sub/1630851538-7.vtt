00:17.225 --> 00:20.311
Once upon a time,
fairy tales were awesome.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.689
We know, you don't believe us.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.859
You think fairy tales are cute
and pink and full of fairies.

00:27.777 --> 00:29.154
-Well, they're not.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.322
-Real fairy tales are scary.

00:33.408 --> 00:36.870
Follow two children
as they venture off into a dark tale.

00:36.953 --> 00:38.455
-A scary tale.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.290
-A strange tale.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.667
-A… Wait a minute.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.335
Are you even old enough for this?

00:44.419 --> 00:46.880
-You really think you can handle it?

00:56.681 --> 00:58.349
Once upon a time,

00:58.433 --> 01:00.226
an old man lay dy--

01:04.314 --> 01:05.815
Once upon a time--

01:05.899 --> 01:08.318
-Sorry. His story now.

01:10.695 --> 01:14.908
Oh… Once upon a time,
an old man lay dying.

01:14.991 --> 01:17.660
Did he say dying?!

01:19.496 --> 01:21.706
-Yes! Dibs on the pancreas!

01:22.707 --> 01:23.666
Um…

01:23.750 --> 01:26.002
Could you start
further back than right now?

01:26.086 --> 01:28.296
A different old man. The king.

01:28.379 --> 01:29.631
Our father is dying?!

01:29.714 --> 01:32.008
Wha--? No! No! No, no…

01:32.092 --> 01:35.929
The old king,
your father's father, your grandfather.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.100
Uh…

01:40.183 --> 01:41.184
Since you left…

01:41.267 --> 01:44.729
-…a darkness has fallen over the kingdom.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.439
Your parents need you.

01:46.523 --> 01:47.440
What?

01:47.524 --> 01:50.318
-No way. We're never going back to them.

01:50.401 --> 01:54.864
Perhaps my story will change
your minds before it's… too late.

01:56.157 --> 01:58.785
We gotta sit through
a whole story before dinner?

01:59.786 --> 02:02.956
-Once upon a time, an old man…

02:03.039 --> 02:04.958
not me, the king…

02:05.041 --> 02:07.377
not your father, your grandfather…

02:07.919 --> 02:09.212
lay dying.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.675
-Where is my most faithful servant?

02:19.389 --> 02:21.975
-Ah, my old friend.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.434
My king.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.645
-I'm soon to pass on.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.940
Has my son returned yet?

02:31.109 --> 02:34.904
-Please take good care of him for me.

02:34.988 --> 02:39.284
And promise me
that you'll show him his inheritance,

02:39.367 --> 02:41.744
the castle, the treasury,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.205
the entire kingdom!

02:44.289 --> 02:45.123
But…

02:45.206 --> 02:48.126
-…you must never show my son

02:48.209 --> 02:50.503
the blue room.

02:53.298 --> 02:58.303
For in that room
is the portrait of the Golden Princess.

02:58.386 --> 03:03.057
And if he sees it, he will surely
fall madly in love with her!

03:04.809 --> 03:07.562
But she is cursed. Cursed!

03:07.645 --> 03:09.480
Whoever marries her

03:09.564 --> 03:13.276
-will die a horrible death.

03:13.359 --> 03:16.863
Just spitballing here,
but, uh, maybe get rid of the painting?

03:16.946 --> 03:20.950
There is also a curse
on getting rid of the painting.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.328
There are a lot of curses around here.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.288
See that goblet right there?

03:25.371 --> 03:27.290
-Cursed!

03:29.334 --> 03:30.835
As you wish, my king.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.504
I promise never to show your son

03:34.088 --> 03:36.633
-the blue room.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.010
Good. Now who wants cake?

03:40.178 --> 03:42.722
Obviously our father
never saw the portrait

03:42.805 --> 03:44.557
because he married our mother.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.977
Yeah. Dad couldn't have fallen in love
with some cursed lady

03:48.061 --> 03:49.312
'cause he didn't die.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.398
There is more you need to understand.

03:52.482 --> 03:56.402
-Once upon a time, a son returned home.

03:58.529 --> 04:01.032
-My father, is he…

04:12.794 --> 04:13.878
Oh…

04:13.962 --> 04:18.675
I have something that might help
distract you from your sadness, my king.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.011
-Let me show you your inheritance.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.847
-Ta-da!

04:30.019 --> 04:31.771
Nothing to see here.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.190
Ta-da!

04:38.486 --> 04:39.445
Nothing to see here.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.490
-Ta-da!

04:44.575 --> 04:46.452
-Nothing to see here.

04:47.036 --> 04:47.996
Ta-da!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.330
Oh, books!

04:49.414 --> 04:50.748
-Shh!

04:52.000 --> 04:55.420
So that's it, the entire Kingdom of Grimm.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.963
It's all yours now.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.632
-But I have no one to share it with.

04:59.716 --> 05:00.883
No family.

05:00.967 --> 05:05.221
It's just been me and my father ever since
the day Mother took up spear-catching.

05:05.722 --> 05:09.559
Of course I have you,
dear faithful Johannes.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.476
But still…

05:12.020 --> 05:14.105
I am… alone.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.236
-Oh, by the way, what's in the blue room?

05:22.155 --> 05:25.450
Huh, I'm sorry. Um, what--
No, uh-- No, is there a blue room?

05:26.576 --> 05:31.080
We passed it a couple times and each
time, you said, "Nothing to see here!"

05:31.164 --> 05:34.417
It kind of makes me think
there is something to see there.

05:34.500 --> 05:36.669
But you didn't show him, right?

05:39.130 --> 05:42.633
Oh. Did you at least tell him
it was just a broom closet?

05:43.634 --> 05:47.180
Oh, sure.
It's easy to think that after the fact.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.266
Your father made me promise
never to show you this room

05:50.350 --> 05:54.479
because he feared
you would fall in love and die.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.523
Well, why didn't you tell me
it was just a broom closet?!

05:57.607 --> 05:58.858
Now, I have to look!

05:58.941 --> 06:01.361
I command you to unlock this door.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.821
Oh, right. Uh, I should have locked it.

06:14.165 --> 06:15.500
She's…

06:16.959 --> 06:20.713
She's the most beautiful woman
in the whole world!

06:20.797 --> 06:22.757
Oh, it's Mom!

06:22.840 --> 06:26.052
-We really should have seen that coming.
-I like surprises.

06:26.135 --> 06:28.805
How come she never mentioned
she was cursed?

06:28.888 --> 06:32.100
And what does it have to do
with them chopping our heads off?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.602
There's more you need to understand.

06:34.685 --> 06:36.646
There's more?!

06:36.729 --> 06:37.730
I give up.

06:37.814 --> 06:40.149
Old guys are all stringy anyways.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.776
Once upon a time,

06:41.859 --> 06:44.779
-a lonely king fell madly in love…

06:44.862 --> 06:46.572
…with a cursed princess.

06:46.656 --> 06:48.199
Uh, good morning, my king.

06:50.618 --> 06:52.370
-Your majesty?

06:52.453 --> 06:53.371
Shh!

06:53.454 --> 06:55.540
-My liege?

06:55.623 --> 06:56.833
Sire?

06:56.916 --> 07:00.086
-Your Highness?

07:01.462 --> 07:06.384
Hey, boss!

07:14.308 --> 07:16.185
Your breakfast, my king.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.772
Does she look sad to you?

07:20.356 --> 07:22.984
Not just sad, lonely.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.486
Like me.

07:25.570 --> 07:26.779
Indeed.

07:26.863 --> 07:29.699
She is the loneliest woman in the world.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.618
The Golden Princess was cursed long ago,

07:32.702 --> 07:36.497
and now anyone she loves
dies a horrible death,

07:36.581 --> 07:39.250
anyone she likes dies an ordinary death.

07:39.333 --> 07:43.212
And anyone she merely tolerates
develops a persistent rash.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.339
I have it all written down somewhere.

07:45.423 --> 07:50.470
Why would anyone place
such a… curse on someone so lovely?

07:50.553 --> 07:52.472
-Devil knows why.
-Ugh.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.016
I never heard anyone say that
in my whole life,

07:55.099 --> 07:57.602
and now I feel like
I hear it all the time.

07:58.895 --> 08:02.565
She locked herself in the tower
to avoid hurting anyone.

08:02.648 --> 08:07.403
The only thing that comforts her
in her loneliness is gold.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.406
-I must go to her.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.158
But the curse is too dangerous!

08:12.241 --> 08:15.745
-I don't care! Love breaks curses!

08:16.412 --> 08:17.330
It does, right?

08:18.456 --> 08:19.582
Well, if it doesn't,

08:19.665 --> 08:22.460
-I will die knowing I followed my heart.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.628
Please, Johannes.

08:23.711 --> 08:26.589
She's the one
I want to share my kingdom with.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.676
As you wish, Your Majesty.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.304
We will need a plan.

08:33.387 --> 08:34.931
Yippee!

08:36.682 --> 08:38.059
Hmm.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.610
Is this all of it?

08:47.693 --> 08:52.198
The entire Royal Treasury
and most of the Rainy Day Treasury.

08:52.281 --> 08:57.203
The Golden Princess only leaves her tower
for the finest golden wares.

08:57.286 --> 09:00.373
My golden wares are the finest.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.000
What does "wares" mean, anyway?

09:03.084 --> 09:04.919
Uh, basically, it just means stuff,

09:05.002 --> 09:06.837
but it sounds classier.

09:08.130 --> 09:11.008
"Stuff." Oh, how pedestrian.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.679
What are you talking about?
"Wares" sounds way snobbier.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.638
Ahem.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.851
-Welp, that's our two pence.
-We'll just swab away now. No need for us.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.061
-Uh…

09:22.144 --> 09:23.813
You were saying about your feet?

09:23.896 --> 09:27.191
So, how long
will this journey to her land take?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.401
Not long.

09:33.197 --> 09:35.408
You were right. That wasn't long.

09:50.965 --> 09:52.550
-Greetings.

09:58.514 --> 10:02.810
-I have good gold… stuff.

10:04.061 --> 10:05.771
He should have said "wares."

10:06.480 --> 10:08.065
From whence do you hail?

10:08.149 --> 10:10.192
I, uh… It…

10:10.276 --> 10:11.152
Uh…

10:15.740 --> 10:16.991
I'm the king of Grimm.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.703
On his deathbed, my father told his
servant not to let me see your portrait,

10:20.786 --> 10:23.539
but I did see it and I love you,
and will you marry me?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.167
-Oh no.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.129
Your father was a wise man,

10:30.212 --> 10:31.964
-for I am cursed.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.635
All whom I love
are fated to die horrible deaths.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.220
-I know, and I don't care.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.555
I don't fear death.

10:39.639 --> 10:42.767
I only fear a life without you by my side.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.102
Oh, that was good.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.687
Yeah, he's got game.

10:48.981 --> 10:53.277
Well… are you going to show me your stuff?

10:53.361 --> 10:58.491
Once upon a time,
a king and a Golden Princess

10:58.574 --> 11:00.326
had their first date…

11:00.910 --> 11:02.912
Ahe-hem! I'm so sorry to interrupt.

11:02.995 --> 11:05.456
But you need to hear
the other side of this story.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.876
-Sorry. We're doing what now?
-Are we in a story inside a story now?

11:08.959 --> 11:11.504
Or a story inside a story
inside the story?

11:11.587 --> 11:13.297
Ugh! My brain itches.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.341
Johannes isn't going
to tell you this part.

11:15.424 --> 11:18.552
-Because it's not important.
-Because he wasn't there.

11:18.636 --> 11:22.181
But we must ensure
that you get the full and complete tale,

11:22.264 --> 11:26.936
and that includes…
the tale of how we became ravens.

11:28.854 --> 11:31.899
-Ugh, I hate this part.
-Yes, dear audience.

11:31.982 --> 11:34.902
We were once as human
as I imagine most of you are.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.780
Behold, two noble deckhands.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.991
-And these two are we.

11:41.075 --> 11:44.787
What?! Mind blown!

11:44.870 --> 11:46.372
Hey, nobody's looking.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.916
Let's cut out,
see if we can get a game going in town.

11:48.999 --> 11:52.795
Ah, the lot of the working man,
to toil in wait for--

11:52.878 --> 11:54.004
Will you knock it off?

11:54.088 --> 11:56.298
You're not an actor anymore.
You're a deckhand.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.216
Very well.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.969
I will join you in your vulgar amusements.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.222
Also I got some loaded dice
so we're totally going to clean up.

12:04.181 --> 12:07.351
Ugh. Do we really have
to go through this again?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.603
Yes, we must tell
the full and complete tale.

12:09.687 --> 12:11.397
Want to be stuck as ravens forever?

12:11.480 --> 12:14.525
Wait, you guys used to be humans?

12:14.608 --> 12:17.027
We told you like a hundred times, Dotty.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.738
-Hundred.
-I told you this morning.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.533
No way! Never!
Not even once! Mind blown again, man!

12:22.616 --> 12:24.243
Ka-pow!

12:24.326 --> 12:26.746
-Mm.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.497
I smell sulfur.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.707
Well, it wasn't me.

12:30.249 --> 12:35.087
-It was me. It's always me.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.339
-Better luck next time.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.303
Have a seat, stranger.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.763
Yeah, but I gotta warn you.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.514
-I've been rolling hot.
-Oh!

12:45.598 --> 12:48.350
-I am no stranger to heat.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.730
So anyway, the king is running
an awful risk with this birdbrained plan.

12:52.813 --> 12:56.442
Ah, but love is like a child
that longs for everything it can.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.737
Mm. "Birdbrained,"
what an enchantrifying phrase.

12:59.820 --> 13:02.031
Eh, but what is this risk you speak of?

13:02.114 --> 13:03.491
Ah.

13:03.574 --> 13:06.076
The king wants
to marry the Golden Princess.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.662
-But she is cursed. Is she not?

13:08.746 --> 13:10.331
-Oh, she is.
-Mm-hmm.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.167
Why would anyone curse someone so lovely?

13:13.250 --> 13:15.419
Devil knows why.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.798
Say, I happen to know
the details of this curse.

13:18.881 --> 13:20.132
Would you like to hear?

13:20.216 --> 13:23.052
-It's very fascinatory.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.470
-Absolutely.
-I'm all ears.

13:24.553 --> 13:25.596
Excellent.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.682
I'll just need you to sign here.

13:28.766 --> 13:29.850
What is this?

13:29.934 --> 13:32.645
Uh, merely a standard
non-disclosure agreement.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.022
Okay, let me give this a quick read-over.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.067
"Speak not these words
to any soul, yada yada,

13:38.150 --> 13:40.027
cursed to be ravens forevermore,

13:40.110 --> 13:42.780
condemned to tell
the full and complete tale."

13:42.863 --> 13:45.574
Whoa, the rest of this
is in hieroglyphics.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.202
Come on, Jacob,
no one reads the fine print.

13:49.036 --> 13:49.912
Jacob.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.830
Very good.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.748
Now, the details of this curse,

13:52.832 --> 13:53.791
specifically the part

13:53.874 --> 13:56.377
-that will affect your king…

13:56.460 --> 13:59.713
-Death shall come astride

13:59.797 --> 14:01.757
a noble beast to ride.

14:01.841 --> 14:06.220
The kingly life is done
unless away it runs.

14:06.303 --> 14:10.641
And next a garment seen
shall captivate the queen.

14:10.724 --> 14:15.312
Then burn this dress with fire
or else the queen expires.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.482
At last, the mistress drops,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.901
her heart within her stops.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.736
Unless you bite her lip

14:22.820 --> 14:24.989
-and three blood drops you sip.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.450
-But he who thwarts this curse,

14:28.534 --> 14:30.870
his fate shall be much worse.

14:30.953 --> 14:36.959
If reasons he make known,
at once he'll turn to stone!

14:40.337 --> 14:42.464
I told you it was fascinatory.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.051
-Well, thank you for this most edifying,

14:46.135 --> 14:48.429
um, experience, Mr…

14:48.512 --> 14:51.765
Oh…
Just call me The Devil.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.518
-Mr. The Devil was my father.

14:57.938 --> 15:01.191
Thank you so much
for making me relive that.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.903
Well, due to that agreement
you didn't read…

15:03.986 --> 15:05.613
You said no one does!

15:05.696 --> 15:09.867
…we're cursed to remain ravens
until we tell the full and complete tale,

15:09.950 --> 15:12.786
and that was an important part
that Johannes did not know.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.413
Hey, can I ask a question?

15:14.496 --> 15:18.167
Is it just me
or is that Devil guy really sweet?

15:22.546 --> 15:23.756
Is he…

15:23.839 --> 15:26.759
I can't tell.
He looked dead when I first met him.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.514
Psst. Johannes, uh, you okay?

15:33.682 --> 15:35.476
Jojo sleepy.

15:35.559 --> 15:38.687
Uh, story, uh… Oh, where was I?

15:38.771 --> 15:41.649
-Mom and Dad on their first date.
-Bet they were hitting it off.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.610
Of course they were.
But how did Dad escape the curse?

15:44.693 --> 15:46.195
Once upon a time,

15:46.904 --> 15:48.072
a lonely king…

15:48.155 --> 15:51.158
-…sought to win a golden heart.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.535
It would appear
you have everything.

15:53.619 --> 15:54.912
Why do you pursue me?

15:54.995 --> 15:57.414
Because I love you!

15:57.957 --> 16:00.668
All that I have means nothing without you.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.129
All that I have are my wares.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.839
My many, many, many…

16:05.923 --> 16:08.175
…many golden wares.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.387
But I would give it all
to have a family again.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.847
That's all I want too!

16:13.931 --> 16:15.057
A family!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.017
-A wife!
-A husband!

16:17.101 --> 16:18.936
And children!

16:22.564 --> 16:24.066
It could never be.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.568
It's said that a fate worse than death

16:26.652 --> 16:29.446
-awaits my children if ever I have any.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.491
-I would never let harm come to them!

16:32.574 --> 16:36.286
Every servant and soldier in my kingdom
would be tasked with their protection.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.123
They would be the treasure of our kingdom.

16:40.332 --> 16:44.003
They… loved us before we were even born.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.340
But that doesn't make any sense
because, you know.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.304
She said yes!

16:59.393 --> 17:00.894
Prepare the ship!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.521
We're heading home!

17:02.604 --> 17:05.065
And we'll be married the moment we arrive.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.860
Curses be cursed.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.164
Welcome to the Kingdom of Grimm!

17:21.457 --> 17:24.293
We have to do something.
They'll die horrible deaths!

17:24.376 --> 17:26.462
Someone has to warn them about the curse.

17:26.545 --> 17:28.589
We're the only ones
who know how to stop it.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.966
-Look, the literal Devil warned us…

17:31.050 --> 17:33.635
…that we would be cursed too
if we tell anyone about this.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.138
And who would believe
such a tall tale anyway?

17:36.221 --> 17:38.015
"Pardon me, oh great King,

17:38.098 --> 17:41.018
but the Devil gave us
the details of a curse

17:41.101 --> 17:43.228
-about to befall you and your bride."

17:43.312 --> 17:47.649
"Well, my king, fortunately for you,
my extensive theatrical experience

17:47.733 --> 17:49.485
-has honed my memory…"
-Not this again.

17:49.568 --> 17:52.488
"…so I can tell you
precisely what the devil said.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.616
"Death shall come astride
a noble beast to ride."

17:55.699 --> 18:00.454
And that is how I learned
the details of the curse,

18:00.537 --> 18:02.706
and how it could be broken.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.792
Well, that's a relief.

18:04.875 --> 18:08.045
Hmm. Yes. So you would think.

18:10.464 --> 18:12.424
-Ooh.

18:12.508 --> 18:14.468
Is it much further?

18:14.551 --> 18:16.678
-Oh…
-I'm sorry, my queen. If only I'd--

18:21.683 --> 18:25.104
Why, this is
the most beautiful beast I've ever seen.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.689
Yes, it's perfect.

18:27.773 --> 18:31.860
"Death shall come astride
a noble beast to ride."

18:31.944 --> 18:35.656
"The kingly life is done
unless away it runs."

18:35.739 --> 18:37.741
-Run!

18:37.825 --> 18:39.034
-Yah!

18:41.787 --> 18:43.413
What is the meaning of this?

18:43.497 --> 18:46.458
I cannot say, my king.
You will have to trust me.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.963
You are my most faithful friend,

18:51.046 --> 18:52.464
and I trust you.

18:52.548 --> 18:54.424
Come. We have a wedding to plan.

18:59.721 --> 19:00.556
Ta-da!

19:02.099 --> 19:06.812
Oh! This is the most
beautiful garment I've ever seen!

19:06.895 --> 19:08.605
It's perfect.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.859
"And next a garment seen
shall captivate the queen."

19:11.942 --> 19:16.280
"Then burn this dress with fire
or else the queen expires."

19:21.785 --> 19:23.996
What is the meaning of this?

19:24.079 --> 19:26.331
-I cannot say, my king.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.251
-You will have to trust me.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.631
-You are my most faithful friend,

19:34.715 --> 19:37.426
and I, uh… I trust you.

19:38.594 --> 19:41.430
But seriously,
wha-- what is wrong with you?

19:41.930 --> 19:44.391
Come. We have a wedding to plan.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.752
I've never been so happy, my queen.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.046
Nor have I, my-- Ah!

20:14.129 --> 20:17.716
-My queen! Someone, do something!

20:17.799 --> 20:20.135
"At last the mistress drops,

20:20.219 --> 20:22.596
her heart within her stops."

20:24.139 --> 20:26.767
-Johannes, what are you doing?!

20:26.850 --> 20:28.852
-After him!

20:35.108 --> 20:39.696
"Unless you bite her lip
and three blood drops you sip."

20:39.780 --> 20:41.823
-Wait.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.326
You kissed our mother?

20:44.409 --> 20:47.537
No, I bit your mother.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.373
Different, but not better.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.587
-What?!

20:57.422 --> 20:58.382
What is the…

20:58.465 --> 21:00.717
-Please, my king.

21:00.801 --> 21:03.637
Explain yourself. Now!

21:03.720 --> 21:05.514
I… I cannot.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.099
-You have to tr--
-Enough!

21:07.182 --> 21:09.810
You have done something unforgivable.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.478
I can trust you no further.

21:11.561 --> 21:12.479
Seize him!

21:13.397 --> 21:15.524
You will burn at the stake at dawn.

21:19.736 --> 21:23.490
-This is my first execution.

21:24.574 --> 21:25.617
Oh, dear.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.457
May I speak?

21:34.084 --> 21:38.922
"But he who thwarts this curse,
his fate shall be much worse."

21:39.006 --> 21:41.842
My king, I did what I did…

21:41.925 --> 21:46.972
"If reasons he make known,
at once he'll turn to stone."

21:47.055 --> 21:49.850
…to save you both from the Queen's curse.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.739
I remain your faithful--

22:04.573 --> 22:06.116
-Friend!

22:13.790 --> 22:17.461
-I'm sorry, Johannes! Johannes!

22:25.719 --> 22:28.555
-Johannes must have overheard us talking.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.099
Well, that doesn't count
as us telling him, does it?

22:31.183 --> 22:33.435
'Cause if it did, we'd have turned into--

22:36.480 --> 22:37.773
Oh crap.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.360
No, no, no, no, no!
My acting career is over!

22:41.443 --> 22:43.945
I don't think you can blame this for that.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.281
Hey, I'm Dotty!

22:46.865 --> 22:48.617
A talking raven?

22:48.700 --> 22:51.244
Talking ravens!

22:54.790 --> 22:57.042
Well, I am William,

22:57.125 --> 22:58.585
and this is…

22:58.668 --> 22:59.753
Jacob.

22:59.836 --> 23:01.129
We used to be humans.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.674
Really?! That's crazy!

23:04.758 --> 23:07.302
I will never forget that fact.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.888
Mind blown, man.

23:10.389 --> 23:15.519
And so to break the Queen's curse,
I was cursed and turned into stone.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.063
There are really a lot
of curses around here.

23:18.146 --> 23:21.942
Now, let's return
to what I still need to show you.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.448
Hope returned
when you were born.

23:30.158 --> 23:34.162
-And their sorrow faded…

23:34.246 --> 23:38.125
-…with a little time…

23:38.208 --> 23:41.503
-…and a lot of love.

23:42.504 --> 23:46.258
-They… They really loved us.

23:46.341 --> 23:49.386
-You were their sun,

23:49.469 --> 23:55.183
-and their sky, and their all.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.226
The end.

24:01.565 --> 24:03.775
-That can't be the end! You're here!
-Wha--?!

24:03.859 --> 24:05.235
And you're not a statue!

24:05.318 --> 24:07.904
And that didn't explain
why they chopped our heads off.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.073
And you said the kingdom was in danger.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.534
Huh? Didn't I tell you that part?

24:12.617 --> 24:14.161
-No!
-Oh…

24:15.495 --> 24:19.249
-Then this next part is the last piece…

24:20.000 --> 24:23.295
…you need to understand
this whole messy story.

24:23.378 --> 24:27.924
And you must,
because your parents need you,

24:28.633 --> 24:29.509
at once.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.845
-For in your absence,

24:31.928 --> 24:34.890
a darkness has fallen over the kingdom.

24:35.849 --> 24:38.852
Something terrible, something… something…

24:40.645 --> 24:42.230
Ah…

24:43.815 --> 24:45.567
Chocolate cake!

24:47.110 --> 24:48.153
Mmm…

24:50.614 --> 24:51.907
Jojo, no!

25:35.325 --> 25:39.579
We must bring faithful Johannes back,

25:40.455 --> 25:43.166
whatever it takes.
