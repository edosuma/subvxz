WEBVTT

00:01.722 --> 00:03.718
- We're pulling the plug.
- And the kids know,

00:03.724 --> 00:04.959
and they're okay.

00:04.965 --> 00:07.316
And things really aren't
gonna be that different.

00:07.322 --> 00:10.095
The on-duty parent will live in here,

00:10.101 --> 00:12.278
taking care of the kids,
living a rich, full life.

00:12.284 --> 00:14.482
That's right. And the off-duty
parent will be living right

00:14.488 --> 00:16.113
here in the garage.

00:16.119 --> 00:17.886
I don't want Lena dating again.

00:17.892 --> 00:21.309
- I want her back together with Martin.
- We haven't had sex in two years.

00:22.292 --> 00:25.197
Let me give you my card, here.

00:25.203 --> 00:27.599
Are you... sending out vibes?

00:27.605 --> 00:30.009
- Vibes?
- Are we vibing?

00:30.622 --> 00:32.887
_

00:35.701 --> 00:38.324
Okay, so, Milo has a
book report due Monday,

00:38.330 --> 00:39.832
Mason needs to practice piano.

00:39.838 --> 00:41.411
At least an hour... that was the deal.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.211
- Okay.
- And Mae needs to take vitamin D.

00:44.217 --> 00:46.006
The doctor said she's deficient.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.787
There's some on the
counter by the microwave.

00:47.793 --> 00:49.036
She's deficient?

00:49.042 --> 00:51.352
How's that even possible? We
live in Southern California.

00:51.358 --> 00:52.662
Have you met Mae?

00:52.853 --> 00:54.053
What are you doing?

00:54.130 --> 00:56.332
Taking the comforter
with me to the garage.

00:56.338 --> 00:58.916
Um, no, you're not.

00:59.187 --> 01:01.404
I just spent a week in
solitary confinement.

01:01.410 --> 01:03.280
I've been looking forward to a real bed,

01:03.286 --> 01:06.393
complete with the
comfort of a comforter.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.208
Ooh! It's so cozy!

01:08.214 --> 01:10.114
You don't even care about blankets.

01:10.120 --> 01:12.412
- You kick them off at night.
- Yeah, but one has to be there

01:12.418 --> 01:13.711
in order for me to kick it off.

01:13.717 --> 01:15.528
And don't tell me that
I can kick off a quilt,

01:15.534 --> 01:17.623
because I've tried it,
sister. It didn't work!

01:17.629 --> 01:19.412
Uh, I'll get you a different blanket!

01:19.418 --> 01:21.086
- You're ridiculous.
- You're ridiculous!

01:21.092 --> 01:23.215
That comforter is property
of the master bedroom.

01:23.221 --> 01:24.742
Whoever sleeps here gets to enjoy

01:24.748 --> 01:28.118
full custody of that
blanket and the children.

01:28.124 --> 01:30.032
- Come here!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:30.038 --> 01:33.007
- Stop it! Martin!
- Rahh! Ow!

01:33.100 --> 01:34.865
It wasn't always like this.

01:35.066 --> 01:36.453
When things were good,

01:36.459 --> 01:38.030
we slept under the same blanket.

01:38.036 --> 01:41.475
But once you introduce that
crappy second blanket, boy...

01:41.481 --> 01:43.860
Yeah, the marriage
is pretty much over.

01:44.657 --> 01:45.862
God!

01:45.868 --> 01:47.767
- Oh! Fine!
- Ow!

01:47.773 --> 01:50.264
- Uh!
- Let the baby have his blankie.

01:50.447 --> 01:51.751
Sank you!

01:53.424 --> 01:54.624
Hey.

01:54.797 --> 01:57.727
I'm sorry. I'll see you next week.

01:59.915 --> 02:03.014
- Thank you. I appreciate the...

You ready to die?

02:26.190 --> 02:27.785
- I surrender! I surrender!
- Gonna cry? Oh, you surrender?

02:29.423 --> 02:32.026
Oh, are you gonna
cry? Are you gonna cry?

02:32.032 --> 02:34.208
Do I need to get you
a crying bikini, huh?

02:34.214 --> 02:35.722
- Sexist.
- Ow! Ow!

02:36.708 --> 02:37.908
Beg pardon?

02:37.914 --> 02:40.295
You're a cisgendered sexist,
and you're raising two more

02:40.301 --> 02:43.280
by continuing to perpetuate
negative stereotypes.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.780
- Wha?
- "Crying bikini"?

02:45.786 --> 02:48.688
Because that's what girls
wear, and only girls cry?

02:48.694 --> 02:51.090
No, no, no. The crying bikini is a...

02:51.306 --> 02:53.518
it's a unisex garment, right?

02:54.895 --> 02:56.372
Oh, come on.

02:56.378 --> 02:58.890
Come on. I'm not sexist.
I'm your dad. I...

02:58.896 --> 03:01.258
always treated you
kids exactly the same.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.464
Really?

03:02.470 --> 03:04.378
Because you never wrestle with me.

03:04.384 --> 03:05.909
You want to wrestle?

03:07.217 --> 03:09.443
- Sure.
- Aww, she's gonna get it.

03:09.449 --> 03:12.521
- You asked for it. Rah! Uh!
- Oof!

03:12.527 --> 03:14.754
- Ooh!
- Oh, my God.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.936
- Oh, my God. Are you okay, honey?
- I'm okay.

03:16.942 --> 03:20.307
She just stood there like a drunk.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.684
- Is it over?
- Well, I mean, it can be.

03:22.690 --> 03:25.289
Technically, you're supposed
to, you know, struggle now,

03:25.295 --> 03:28.109
- try to get free.
- He's not even torturing her.

03:28.115 --> 03:30.309
Come on, Dad. What
about the rib cruncher?

03:30.315 --> 03:32.032
Yeah. That's your signature move.

03:32.038 --> 03:34.710
You want your ribs... crunched?

03:35.723 --> 03:36.932
Why not?

03:37.011 --> 03:40.620
Okay. Ah! The rib
cruncher... crunchin'...

03:40.626 --> 03:42.120
G-g-g-g-g... uh!

03:43.187 --> 03:45.409
She's impervious.

03:46.058 --> 03:47.356
Okay, that's it. We're done.

03:47.362 --> 03:49.133
Wrestling's over. Come on. Everyone. Go.

03:49.139 --> 03:50.636
- Aw.
- Go. Go read a book.

03:50.642 --> 03:53.057
No fair. Girls ruin everything.

03:53.063 --> 03:54.856
Hey, hey. Milo, get
over here. Come here.

03:55.358 --> 03:56.558
Come here.

03:57.687 --> 03:59.984
Don't say, "Girls ruin everything."

03:59.990 --> 04:03.476
It-it's not cool to
generalize about all girls.

04:04.072 --> 04:06.173
Say, "Mae ruins everything."

04:06.358 --> 04:08.190
I appreciate that.

04:10.139 --> 04:12.927
I'm sorry. Is it, like,
really damp in here?

04:12.933 --> 04:14.521
It is. Here.

04:14.618 --> 04:15.896
This should help.

04:18.515 --> 04:20.125
Huh. Look at those guys.

04:20.966 --> 04:22.902
- Are those...
- Centipedes, yeah.

04:23.060 --> 04:25.405
I've come to know
their habits quite well.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.677
They are a moisture-loving lot.

04:27.683 --> 04:31.009
But these boys flew a little
too close to the sun, am I right?

04:32.466 --> 04:34.480
- I'm sorry.
- What is it?

04:34.486 --> 04:36.364
I just hate seeing you like this?

04:36.370 --> 04:38.481
Like what? I'm happy.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.551
- You can't be.
- But I am.

04:40.557 --> 04:42.714
Camille, this is not that bad.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.353
And besides, it's only for a week.

04:44.359 --> 04:48.090
Actually, it's 26 weeks, if
the arrangement lasts a year.

04:48.096 --> 04:50.059
Well, I could see it
lasting more than a year.

04:50.065 --> 04:52.769
Honestly, I look forward
to my garage weeks.

04:52.775 --> 04:55.691
This is my time to focus on myself.

04:55.954 --> 04:59.076
I had an epiphany last
week in the main house.

04:59.974 --> 05:02.495
You know how our shower
has that great big skylight?

05:02.540 --> 05:04.440
- No.
- Well, it does.

05:04.446 --> 05:07.034
And I always insisted
that we never open it

05:07.040 --> 05:09.253
because of the squirrels
that run across our roof.

05:09.259 --> 05:10.459
It drove Martin crazy.

05:10.465 --> 05:12.229
He said, "What's the
point of having a skylight

05:12.235 --> 05:13.849
if we never get to open it?"

05:16.053 --> 05:17.853
I had a head full of shampoo...

05:17.859 --> 05:19.238
I'm gonna kill him.

05:19.346 --> 05:20.839
...and I was about to
get out of the shower

05:20.845 --> 05:22.642
to close the thing when...

05:26.139 --> 05:27.339
You wanna go?

05:28.390 --> 05:30.017
Don't even think about coming down here.

05:30.023 --> 05:31.414
I will kill a squirrel.

05:31.641 --> 05:34.008
And in that moment,
I realized something.

05:34.014 --> 05:36.814
That you were right and Martin
should have listened to you all along?

05:36.820 --> 05:39.220
No. That squirrel is the only man

05:39.226 --> 05:41.048
who has seen me naked in two years...

05:41.054 --> 05:42.486
and he's not even a man.

05:44.249 --> 05:46.032
This is my week to change that.

05:48.000 --> 05:54.074

05:55.325 --> 05:57.326
- You're not gonna eat that, bro.
- I am, bro.

05:57.332 --> 05:59.223
- Bro, I'm taking it.
- Come at me, bro.

05:59.229 --> 06:01.724
- Don't say "come at me, bro" to your bro, bro.
- Here.

06:02.203 --> 06:04.537
Mae, you okay?

06:04.605 --> 06:08.801
Yeah, just... a little too much
bro-energy, if I'm being honest.

06:08.807 --> 06:11.541
Mmm, well, they are... actual bros.

06:11.547 --> 06:13.399
And I guess I didn't get
the memo about this being

06:13.405 --> 06:16.090
a shirtless dinner, or
I would have joined in.

06:16.096 --> 06:17.960
- Gross.
- My point exactly.

06:18.229 --> 06:20.348
Ditto for the recent no-flushing trend.

06:20.354 --> 06:23.042
- Hey, if it's yellow, let it mellow.
- Ah, that's a good boy.

06:23.048 --> 06:24.840
How is that a "good boy"?

06:24.846 --> 06:27.426
Mae, when you're a mom,
you can make the rules,

06:27.432 --> 06:29.239
but I'm playing Mom this week.

06:29.245 --> 06:31.354
And why are you "playing Mom"?

06:31.360 --> 06:34.463
Because you're taking care
of your kids and your house?

06:34.469 --> 06:36.448
He's not really taking
care of his house.

06:36.454 --> 06:38.463
I'm literally only shirtless
'cause there's no clean laundry.

06:38.469 --> 06:40.268
Shut up, traitors!

06:40.274 --> 06:42.434
Do you want clean laundry
or the Master Sword in Zelda?

06:42.440 --> 06:43.640
I can't do both.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.534
And besides...

06:45.747 --> 06:47.823
there was a whole movie
made about it in the '80s.

06:47.901 --> 06:49.237
It was called "Mr. Mom."

06:49.243 --> 06:51.647
You know what a better name
for that movie would have been?

06:51.831 --> 06:53.031
"Dad."

06:54.422 --> 06:55.919
- She's not wrong.
- Yep.

06:55.925 --> 06:58.403
- All right, guys. Zip it.
- He...

07:02.159 --> 07:04.454
_

07:05.179 --> 07:07.391
_

07:07.397 --> 07:08.671
Who are you texting?

07:08.984 --> 07:10.184
Mae.

07:10.190 --> 07:11.907
Why are you lying in wait?

07:11.913 --> 07:16.399
Sorry, but... Mom, I can't
handle Dad weeks. I just can't.

07:16.405 --> 07:19.784
Nobody brushes and nobody
flushes, and not to tattle,

07:19.790 --> 07:23.317
but Dad never moves the wet clothes
from the washer into the dryer.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.628
Can I please just
stay out here with you?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.227
Oh, sweetie.

07:27.414 --> 07:29.095
You know, I would love that,

07:29.101 --> 07:31.856
but I think your dad
would be heartbroken.

07:32.479 --> 07:36.039
I mean, he really looks
forward to his weeks with you.

07:36.125 --> 07:38.443
I mean, your dad adores you.

07:39.641 --> 07:42.444
You know who's a real pain
in the ass? Your daughter.

07:42.450 --> 07:44.133
I mean, when did she get so judgmental?

07:44.139 --> 07:46.446
Seriously, Mae can go topple
the patriarchy someplace else,

07:46.452 --> 07:48.046
because I am her actual father,

07:48.052 --> 07:50.216
and the next time that
girl rolls her eyes at me,

07:50.222 --> 07:51.422
I'm gonna tell her...

07:52.987 --> 07:54.804
The future is female?

07:58.685 --> 08:00.490
W-Well, what the hell is wrong with her?

08:00.496 --> 08:01.995
Maybe she feels outnumbered.

08:02.001 --> 08:04.205
Well, I'm sure Mason feels
the same way during your week.

08:04.211 --> 08:06.086
But he's not outnumbered. He has Milo...

08:06.092 --> 08:09.101
Oh, Milo doesn't count. He's,
like, a little half-human.

08:09.204 --> 08:11.103
Look. Mae is smart.

08:11.109 --> 08:12.356
And insightful.

08:12.362 --> 08:14.729
- And she's also...
- Not my daughter?

08:14.831 --> 08:16.732
- I was gonna say "a feminist."
- 'Cause you can tell me

08:16.738 --> 08:19.417
- if she's not my daughter.
- Mae is a budding feminist,

08:19.423 --> 08:22.636
- and as such, she is questioning everything.
- Okay.

08:22.642 --> 08:26.059
So, maybe if you just took a
little bit more of an interest

08:26.065 --> 08:27.536
in the things that she cares about,

08:27.542 --> 08:29.763
- the way you do with the boys.
- Oh god, here we go again.

08:30.155 --> 08:31.631
If you don't want my advice,

08:31.637 --> 08:33.727
I've got a whole shelf
full of parenting books...

08:34.121 --> 08:36.009
- and cookbooks.
- So, you're just gonna use this

08:36.015 --> 08:37.900
as an excuse to push your own agenda

08:37.907 --> 08:40.799
- once again. Oh, just admit it, Lena,
- You came knocking on my door.

08:40.804 --> 08:43.385
it kills you that I don't
parent the way you do.

08:43.390 --> 08:45.922
And yet, here I stand... not dead.

08:45.928 --> 08:48.353
And clearly, my rules
don't govern your world,

08:48.359 --> 08:49.738
- Right.
- hence the skylight.

08:49.766 --> 08:52.217
Oh, the skylight?

08:52.223 --> 08:53.524
The skylight!

08:53.530 --> 08:56.524
Oh, you're just angry because
you can't block my sunshine.

08:56.530 --> 08:59.048
I was eye-[BLEEP] by a squirrel!

08:59.733 --> 09:00.933
Whoa.

09:01.811 --> 09:04.222
- I didn't mean to block his sunshine,
- _

09:04.228 --> 09:05.927
but somehow, I'm always the bad guy.

09:05.933 --> 09:07.622
- Yeah.
- "Yeah"?

09:07.628 --> 09:09.418
Look, I realize that

09:09.424 --> 09:11.613
things between you
two are complicated...

09:11.619 --> 09:13.184
They're not complicated. They're over.

09:13.190 --> 09:16.200
...but then again, the devil you know...

09:16.206 --> 09:19.024
But then again, who wants
to be married to the devil?

09:19.030 --> 09:21.196
You should've heard the way
he talked to me last night.

09:21.202 --> 09:22.907
He blames me for everything,

09:22.913 --> 09:24.907
including his relationship with Mae.

09:24.913 --> 09:27.297
But on the plus side, not a squirrel.

09:27.303 --> 09:29.172
Fine, I'll give you "not a squirrel."

09:29.178 --> 09:31.171
But need I remind you, Martin's dating.

09:31.177 --> 09:34.696
We have no way of knowing
whether he is or isn't dating.

09:34.702 --> 09:37.282
Well, regardless, I am more interested

09:37.288 --> 09:39.079
in the cute doctor I've been texting.

09:39.085 --> 09:40.469
What cute doctor?

09:40.475 --> 09:43.355
The one who treated Mason. I
asked him out for drinks tonight.

09:43.526 --> 09:45.856
This is my mom's, but I'm allowed.

09:45.862 --> 09:47.565
- I know, Toby.
- So, what?

09:47.571 --> 09:50.548
You just use emojis
now, like some tween?

09:50.554 --> 09:52.009
- The heart-eyes one...
- _

09:52.015 --> 09:53.794
- The tongue-out one...
- _

09:53.800 --> 09:56.090
- The snorting-coke one...
- That's not coke.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.858
That is a ton of coke.

09:58.493 --> 10:00.122
Okay, relax, chip reader.

10:00.128 --> 10:02.101
We all waited for you, and
now, the second you're ready,

10:02.107 --> 10:03.421
Toby's supposed to jump?!

10:04.963 --> 10:07.055
I thought you'd be happy for me.

10:07.061 --> 10:08.869
- Well, I'm not.
- _

10:09.342 --> 10:12.547
I'm sorry. I just really miss
the way things used to be.

10:12.553 --> 10:13.938
Well, I don't,

10:13.944 --> 10:16.220
okay? I don't want a platonic marriage.

10:16.226 --> 10:18.430
I want to be with someone who's into me.

10:18.436 --> 10:21.637
I want to be with someone who
wants to tear my clothes off.

10:22.091 --> 10:25.990
Are you the type of person
who would let someone...

10:26.357 --> 10:27.705
tear their clothes off?

10:28.598 --> 10:32.874
Well, obviously not my high-end pieces.

10:34.655 --> 10:36.365
_

10:41.930 --> 10:43.330
"Gender Wars"?

10:43.517 --> 10:45.882
- Why are you looking at Mom's books?
- Oh.

10:46.631 --> 10:49.787
Hey, man. Uh, I'm just
doing a little research on

10:49.793 --> 10:51.045
your sister.

10:52.766 --> 10:54.099
And your mom.

10:54.105 --> 10:56.837
- And just women in general. You know.
- _

10:56.843 --> 10:59.147
- Care to join me?
- I'm good.

11:01.344 --> 11:03.971
I mean, it'd be one thing if she
were dating to get back at him,

11:03.977 --> 11:06.244
but I don't think
she's doing it for him.

11:06.250 --> 11:07.857
I think she's doing it for her.

11:07.863 --> 11:09.099
Which means...

11:09.105 --> 11:10.387
it's really over.

11:10.706 --> 11:12.098
That's a fair assumption.

11:14.810 --> 11:17.793
- I don't understand your attitude.
- What attitude?

11:17.799 --> 11:20.193
How can you take this
whole thing just lying down?

11:20.199 --> 11:22.099
Take what lying down?
Someone else's divorce?

11:22.105 --> 11:23.919
Well, if it could happen to them,

11:23.925 --> 11:25.904
- it could happen to us.
- It's not gonna happen to us.

11:25.910 --> 11:27.621
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause if you ever tried to leave,

11:27.627 --> 11:29.497
I would hold you captive like an orca.

11:29.503 --> 11:30.970
- That's illegal.
- What do I care?

11:30.976 --> 11:32.894
Without you, my life is over anyway.

11:33.696 --> 11:38.275
See, that is exactly the type of
needy, desperate, deranged behavior

11:38.281 --> 11:41.173
that it takes to keep
a marriage together.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.326
Sorry, I flushed.

11:49.212 --> 11:50.611
What's with the hats?

11:50.617 --> 11:52.043
Well, uh...

11:52.418 --> 11:55.135
we just wanted to show you
that we support your cause.

11:55.141 --> 11:56.443
My cause?

11:57.031 --> 11:58.739
You guys are hilarious.

12:04.026 --> 12:05.916
I told you this wasn't gonna work.

12:08.423 --> 12:10.147
I like mine.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.710
Whoa, are you cooking?

12:12.716 --> 12:15.782
Yeah. I just realized
that I did have a tendency

12:15.788 --> 12:17.651
to let Lena do most
of the household stuff,

12:17.657 --> 12:20.265
and now, I'm... trying to... you know...

12:20.271 --> 12:21.692
- Change?
- Yes.

12:21.698 --> 12:22.998
Change.

12:23.004 --> 12:24.555
W-Why now?

12:24.783 --> 12:27.653
Well, for starters,
my daughter hates me.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.653
I mean, I-I've already screwed
up my relationship with Lena.

12:29.659 --> 12:31.188
I don't want to lose Mae, too.

12:32.538 --> 12:34.838
Martin, you're so vulnerable right now.

12:36.143 --> 12:39.072
It's beautiful, bro.
It's seriously beautiful.

12:39.363 --> 12:42.269
- Can I give you a hug?
- I-I-I don't really want to do that.

12:42.275 --> 12:43.475
Come on.

12:43.654 --> 12:44.908
Let's hug.

12:46.865 --> 12:48.103
Okay.

12:53.428 --> 12:55.028
- Mmm.
- Ahh.

12:55.410 --> 12:56.635
It's all right.

12:59.557 --> 13:00.769
- Oh!
- Aah!

13:00.775 --> 13:02.591
Stay in the hug, all
right? Don't turn around.

13:02.597 --> 13:04.419
- Oh god, what's happening? What...
- You don't want to see.

13:04.425 --> 13:06.464
- I do want to see!
- Okay, you're gonna stay in the hug,

13:06.470 --> 13:09.091
because you're gonna need it.
Now, slowly rotate to the right.

13:09.097 --> 13:12.049
Slowly. Great. Great!

13:15.631 --> 13:17.062
She got a date, huh?

13:23.260 --> 13:24.460
_

13:24.466 --> 13:26.378
I'm, uh, really glad you texted.

13:26.384 --> 13:28.996
- Well, I'm glad you responded.
- Of course I responded.

13:29.872 --> 13:32.600
Although, to be clear,
I don't do cocaine.

13:32.606 --> 13:34.638
Okay, is that the coke emoji?

13:34.724 --> 13:36.296
I...

13:36.302 --> 13:38.731
You're really cute. You know?

13:39.230 --> 13:40.465
And pretty.

13:41.426 --> 13:43.338
And I would like to kiss you.

13:43.985 --> 13:48.681
Uh, I-I-I'd like to administer a kiss.

13:48.767 --> 13:51.487
Well, let me prep the patient.

13:51.493 --> 13:52.806
Ahh.

13:55.262 --> 13:57.756
- Soft, but not mushy. And, like, tongue,
- Oh...

13:57.762 --> 13:59.684
but not an oppressive
amount. You know what?

13:59.690 --> 14:02.166
Use your best judgment on the tongue.

14:03.258 --> 14:05.037
I just wouldn't... I wouldn't go crazy.

14:05.233 --> 14:07.240
- Okay.
- You like to call the shots, huh?

14:07.246 --> 14:09.227
Sorry. I'm sorry.

14:09.233 --> 14:11.733
- I just... I'm trying to work on that.
- Yeah.

14:11.739 --> 14:13.735
- You know what? Don't listen to me.
- Oh, okay.

14:13.741 --> 14:15.840
You just kiss me however you want.

14:16.426 --> 14:17.626
Thank you.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.544
And I'm sure you're gonna crush it.

14:20.316 --> 14:22.711
- So, good luck in there. You got it.
- Okay.

14:22.717 --> 14:24.230
- Can I come in now?
- Do it.

14:35.768 --> 14:38.684
I think, maybe, I got into
your head a little bit.

14:38.690 --> 14:41.100
Um, why don't we take another run at it,

14:41.106 --> 14:43.184
but this time, you know, just...

14:43.190 --> 14:45.008
I think, it was like...

14:45.014 --> 14:48.301
- It was...
- Wait. Uh, rain check.

14:48.307 --> 14:50.615
One of my patients
just landed in the ER.

14:50.621 --> 14:53.122
- Oh, my gosh. Of course, yes. Go.
- Uh...

14:56.221 --> 14:57.434
Bye.

15:03.704 --> 15:05.550
So, you're a nightmare.

15:06.451 --> 15:07.822
I beg your pardon?

15:07.952 --> 15:09.316
Well, how can anyone succeed

15:09.322 --> 15:11.019
when they're being given
that much direction?

15:11.025 --> 15:13.534
See, now, I would argue,
"How can one not succeed

15:13.540 --> 15:15.001
when given that much direction?"

15:15.007 --> 15:16.297
So, you dictate orders,

15:16.303 --> 15:17.712
he says, "Yes, ma'am," and

15:17.718 --> 15:20.419
- next thing you know...
- Haven't had sex in two years.

15:20.797 --> 15:22.306
Who hasn't?

15:22.312 --> 15:24.101
What? I don't know. Not me.

15:24.107 --> 15:26.250
I was just saying, like, one hasn't...

15:26.334 --> 15:28.243
just one that hasn't had sex
in two years. I don't know.

15:28.249 --> 15:31.118
I'm just saying hypotheticals.

15:31.124 --> 15:34.156
Well, hypothetically...

15:35.955 --> 15:38.345
I think you need someone
who knows how to push back.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.870
My ex-husband pushed back.

15:39.876 --> 15:41.769
- Did he push back hard?
- Hard...

15:41.775 --> 15:43.678
yeah. We fought all the time.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.397
So, maybe you like it gentle.

15:47.884 --> 15:50.157
Okay.

15:50.333 --> 15:54.030
Relax. Let's just relax, okay?

15:54.161 --> 15:55.632
I'm someone's mother.

15:55.638 --> 15:57.639
I'm actually three people's mother.

15:57.645 --> 16:01.836
And motherhood and
sexuality can't co-exist?

16:02.206 --> 16:04.616
'Cause, from where I'm
sitting, they can...

16:05.722 --> 16:06.922
and do...

16:08.601 --> 16:11.429
...if you could just chill out a little.

16:12.037 --> 16:13.781
I can chill out.

16:15.052 --> 16:17.230
I don't want to lie to
you... I cannot chill out.

16:17.341 --> 16:19.856
Kids! Dinner!

16:20.855 --> 16:22.357
Okay, you guys.

16:22.460 --> 16:24.801
So, the reason I do not cook

16:24.807 --> 16:27.316
is not because I am a male chauvinist,

16:27.892 --> 16:29.528
it's because...

16:31.196 --> 16:32.636
...I suck.

16:46.347 --> 16:47.659
It's delicious.

16:48.164 --> 16:49.367
Stop it.

16:49.373 --> 16:51.065
It is. See for yourself.

16:51.071 --> 16:54.969
It looks like dog barf,
but it tastes great.

16:54.975 --> 16:56.175
Cut it out.

17:01.330 --> 17:02.943
It is delicious.

17:03.331 --> 17:05.512
Men really can do everything, huh?

17:10.340 --> 17:12.653
- Not bad, huh?
- See, Dad?

17:12.659 --> 17:15.342
If I hadn't pizza-shamed you,
you would have never discovered

17:15.348 --> 17:17.546
- your inner domestic goddess.
- Mm.

17:17.551 --> 17:18.944
This is true.

17:18.950 --> 17:21.553
- Can I be excused?
- Yes, you can, little man.

17:21.559 --> 17:23.286
- Uh, me, too?
- Yeah. You, too.

17:24.159 --> 17:25.771
- Hey, Mae.
- Hm?

17:26.678 --> 17:29.096
You know, just because I'm the guy

17:29.193 --> 17:31.500
doesn't mean that I'm the bad guy.

17:32.074 --> 17:33.274
I know.

17:33.875 --> 17:35.665
Okay. Good.

17:35.863 --> 17:37.387
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

17:38.069 --> 17:41.865
When you were little, I really
knew how to play with you.

17:41.871 --> 17:44.083
I did. I would... I would
throw you up in the air,

17:44.089 --> 17:46.620
and you would scream and
run around, and I mean...

17:47.801 --> 17:52.005
But then, you grew up,
and you got so serious.

17:52.512 --> 17:54.801
- I still like to play.
- You do?

17:55.199 --> 17:56.642
What do you like to play?

17:59.589 --> 18:00.789
Boggle.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.788
Well, Mae, I have some
really bad news for you.

18:05.868 --> 18:07.400
Tomorrow night...

18:08.045 --> 18:09.665
I'm gonna murder you.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.204
At Boggle!

18:13.124 --> 18:14.953
- All right.
- Okay.

18:22.634 --> 18:23.949
You're home early.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.261
Are you waiting up for me?

18:27.267 --> 18:28.467
No.

18:29.337 --> 18:30.537
Yes.

18:32.834 --> 18:34.261
Hey.

18:34.741 --> 18:36.226
You cooked.

18:36.529 --> 18:37.947
Is Mae happy?

18:38.329 --> 18:40.262
Your books were very helpful.

18:40.421 --> 18:43.425
And so was your advice, so, thank you.

18:43.431 --> 18:44.631
You're welcome.

18:47.534 --> 18:51.925
And I'm... I'm sorry if I, um, just...

18:52.151 --> 18:54.841
If I have a tendency to... just...

18:56.347 --> 18:58.454
I'm sorry that I blocked your sunshine.

18:59.235 --> 19:02.635
Well, I'm sorry for whatever I said

19:02.641 --> 19:05.766
that made you highlight
pages 18 through 48.

19:05.772 --> 19:07.464
You actually read that?

19:07.470 --> 19:10.854
- Oh, I read. I cook. I clean.
- Oh?

19:10.860 --> 19:12.521
I run a mile in under 6.

19:12.527 --> 19:14.427
Oh. Okay.

19:17.816 --> 19:20.621

got big shoes to fill.
