NOT MOE!
NOT MOE!

14:04.446 --> 14:06.779
- THIS WAY!

14:23.664 --> 14:27.765
- UNH!
LET...ME...IN!

14:30.536 --> 14:32.369
- IT APPEARS
WE CANNOT GET OUT.

14:32.371 --> 14:35.338
- YEAH, BUT AT LEAST THOSE
THINGS DIDN'T FOLLOW US IN.

14:35.340 --> 14:37.540
- UH, GUYS,

14:37.542 --> 14:39.909
YOU KINDA NEED TO SEE THIS.

14:44.981 --> 14:47.715
- I'M GETTING
A SERIOUS DEJA VU VIBE HERE.

14:47.717 --> 14:49.249
- NOT ONLY THAT,

14:49.251 --> 14:52.485
BUT SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PLACE
SEEMS REALLY FAMILIAR.

14:52.487 --> 14:55.120
- YES, IT LOOKS LIKE...

14:55.122 --> 14:57.221
RAVEN.

14:58.958 --> 15:01.158
- THE GEM!
IT'S GONE!

15:01.960 --> 15:04.460
- YOU MUST BE DISAPPOINTED.

15:04.462 --> 15:06.795
- WHERE'S THE GEM?
- NOT HERE.

15:07.998 --> 15:12.066
BUT MUCH CLOSER TO YOU
THAN YOU THINK.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.667
- WHO IS SCATH?

15:13.669 --> 15:15.368
TELL ME
WHO YOU'RE WORKING FOR!

15:15.370 --> 15:16.736
- HMM.

15:16.738 --> 15:18.838
I'D LOVE TO INTRODUCE YOU,
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

15:18.840 --> 15:21.207
YOU WON'T BE AROUND
THAT LONG.

15:29.149 --> 15:31.149
- AZARATH.

15:31.151 --> 15:33.317
MY LAST HOPE.

15:41.860 --> 15:44.060
- AAH!
- AAH!

15:51.502 --> 15:52.868
- NOW, TITANS,

15:52.870 --> 15:55.170
YOU'RE JUST DELAYING
THE INEVITABLE.

15:55.172 --> 15:57.906
- WE'RE NOT LEAVING
WITHOUT THAT GEM!

15:57.908 --> 15:59.741
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

15:59.743 --> 16:01.576
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING AT ALL.

16:01.578 --> 16:02.977
- HUNH!
UGH!

16:02.979 --> 16:05.279
- OOF!

16:13.555 --> 16:15.721
- OH!

16:17.624 --> 16:19.724
UGH...

16:27.933 --> 16:30.199
- [GRUNTING]

16:40.310 --> 16:42.476
- OH!

16:47.849 --> 16:48.781
- OOF!

16:48.783 --> 16:49.882
- [MOANING]

16:49.884 --> 16:51.383
HUH?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.986
- YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY LIKE WORKING
FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

16:54.988 --> 16:58.856
IT LETS ME BE A LITTLE MORE...
HANDS-ON.

17:11.804 --> 17:14.137
- HELLO?

17:30.421 --> 17:33.321
- NOT LIKE I EXPECTED A PARADE,
BUT...

17:46.936 --> 17:49.002
ARELLA...

17:49.004 --> 17:52.005
NO, WAIT!
I'VE COME BACK.

17:52.007 --> 17:55.775
MOTHER, PLEASE HELP ME.

17:55.777 --> 17:58.778
- YOU ALWAYS HAD A HOME HERE,
MY CHILD...

17:58.780 --> 18:00.946
BUT HELP WE COULD NOT GIVE.

18:00.948 --> 18:03.281
- THE PROPHECY,
IT'S HAPPENING.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.650
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME
HOW TO STOP IT.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.452
- NOTHING COULD BE DONE.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.955
THE PROMISE OF YOUR BIRTH
WAS ABSOLUTE.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.958
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU!
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY!

18:13.960 --> 18:16.293
I DON'T WANT TO BE THIS.

18:16.295 --> 18:18.762
I DON'T WANT TO HELP HIM.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.898
MOTHER, I'M...AFRAID.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.200
- YOU FOREVER HAD THE LOVE
OF YOUR PEOPLE, RAVEN,

18:25.202 --> 18:27.235
EVEN KNOWING
WHAT YOU HAD BECOME

18:27.237 --> 18:30.071
AND WHAT THAT WOULD BRING.

18:30.073 --> 18:32.139
IT WAS TOO LATE FOR EARTH,

18:32.141 --> 18:34.908
JUST AS IT WAS
TOO LATE FOR AZARATH.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.814
- NO...

18:41.816 --> 18:45.884
- HA HA HA...

18:45.886 --> 18:48.052
AH, HA HA HA!

18:52.157 --> 18:55.391
- [ALL GRUNTING]

18:55.393 --> 18:57.259
- STRUGGLING ONLY
MAKES IT WORSE,

18:57.261 --> 19:00.629
AND HOW I HATE
TO SEE YOU SUFFER.

19:00.631 --> 19:02.664
THIS WON'T HURT A BIT.

19:02.666 --> 19:04.032
- WANNA BET?

19:04.034 --> 19:06.334
- UGH!

19:18.747 --> 19:21.647
- I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE THEM
OUT OF THIS!

19:21.649 --> 19:25.350
- HOW SWEET.
YOU'VE COME BACK
TO SAVE YOUR FRIENDS,

19:25.352 --> 19:27.919
BUT YOU'RE ONLY DELAYING
THEIR PAIN.

19:27.921 --> 19:29.253
AND YOURS.

19:29.255 --> 19:32.489
- WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR?

19:32.491 --> 19:34.724
AREN'T YOU GONNA ATTACK?
REDUCE ME TO ASHES?

19:34.726 --> 19:38.827
OR DID YOUR MASTER FORBID YOU
FROM HURTING ME?

19:38.829 --> 19:41.996
DID HE ORDER YOU TO KEEP
HIS GEMS SAFE?

19:41.998 --> 19:43.864
- SO, RAVEN HAS THE GEM?

19:43.866 --> 19:46.766
- NO, RAVEN IS THE GEM.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.668
- I'LL BE SURE TO GIVE HIM
YOUR REGARDS.

19:52.139 --> 19:54.472
- I'M NOT FINISHED YET!

19:54.474 --> 19:55.973
HUNH!
UNH!

19:55.975 --> 19:59.475
THIS TIME,
I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR YOU.

20:02.046 --> 20:03.345
HUNH!
- UNH!

20:03.347 --> 20:05.713
- HUNH!
- OOF!

20:07.883 --> 20:11.683
- YOU TELL HIM THAT HE'LL HAVE
TO DESTROY ME BEFORE I HELP HIM.

20:11.685 --> 20:13.951
- YOU CAN TELL HIM YOURSELF.

20:13.953 --> 20:16.019
THE HOUR IS NEAR.

20:18.356 --> 20:20.956
- UNH!
UGH!

20:20.958 --> 20:22.891
- AAH!
- HUNH!

20:22.893 --> 20:24.959
- UGH!

20:25.828 --> 20:27.961
UNH!

20:29.064 --> 20:31.064
- HUNH!

20:40.141 --> 20:42.541
I'M NOT AFRAID OF YOU ANYMORE.

20:42.543 --> 20:47.412
- YOU MIGHT NOT FEAR ME,
BUT LOOK WHO'S AFRAID OF YOU.

20:49.783 --> 20:51.949
- RAVEN?

20:56.554 --> 20:58.720
- THE ANCIENT ORDER USED
THE NAME "SCATH" TO PROTECT

20:58.722 --> 21:01.522
THE TRUE IDENTITY
OF THEIR MASTER.

21:01.524 --> 21:03.857
WE KNOW HIM AS TRIGON.

21:03.859 --> 21:05.291
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

21:05.293 --> 21:08.093
THAT'S WHO WE'RE UP AGAINST?
OH, MAN.

21:08.095 --> 21:11.729
- HIS CRUELTY IS LEGENDARY,
EVEN ON MY WORLD.

21:11.731 --> 21:14.898
- SO, WHAT MAKES YOU GO
ALL GLOWY IN THE DARK?

21:14.900 --> 21:17.600
- IT'S A WARNING.
IT MEANS TRIGON IS COMING.

21:17.602 --> 21:20.469
AND THE WAY HE GETS HERE IS
THROUGH ME.

21:21.271 --> 21:23.537
I'M NOT JUST A PERSON...

21:23.539 --> 21:25.539
I'M A PORTAL.

21:25.541 --> 21:27.541
- BUT, RAVEN,
WHY YOU?

21:27.543 --> 21:31.077
- BECAUSE...TRIGON...

21:31.079 --> 21:33.646
IS MY FATHER.

21:33.648 --> 21:36.015
BAD THINGS ARE GOING
TO HAPPEN SOON...

21:36.017 --> 21:38.117
REALLY BAD THINGS...

21:38.119 --> 21:39.918
AND IT'S GONNA BE MY FAULT.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.320
I THOUGHT
I COULD HANDLE THIS ALONE.

21:42.322 --> 21:47.224
I TRIED,
BUT I WAS WRONG.

21:47.226 --> 21:50.293
- FOR CONFIDING IN US,
WE ARE MOST HUMBLED.

21:50.295 --> 21:52.295
- I ONLY HAVE ONE QUESTION.

21:52.297 --> 21:53.829
HOW DO WE STOP HIM?

21:53.831 --> 21:54.830
- WE DON'T.

21:54.832 --> 21:57.666
- THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE STILL CAN'T TRY.

22:04.840 --> 22:07.340
- THE PROPHECY
HAS BEEN REVEALED.

22:07.342 --> 22:10.076
THE PORTAL HAS ACCEPTED
HER FATE.

22:10.078 --> 22:12.545
- YOU SERVE ME WELL,
SLADE.

22:12.547 --> 22:17.549
CONTINUE TO PLEASE ME,
AND I SHALL HONOR OUR DEAL.

22:17.551 --> 22:20.985
I SHALL RETURN
WHAT YOU HAVE LOST.

22:20.987 --> 22:23.120
- I AM DEPENDING ON IT.
