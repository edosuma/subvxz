00:12.960 --> 00:14.560
Merry Christmas, sir.

00:14.560 --> 00:15.680
- What can I do for you.

00:15.680 --> 00:18.530
- The question is what we can do for you.

00:18.530 --> 00:21.090
- We're here to introduce you
to the power of Jesus Christ.

00:21.090 --> 00:22.670
It's only going to take a
few moments of your time.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.890
But the benefits
shall last you all of eternity.

00:24.890 --> 00:28.750
- Well, I appreciate that,
but I already know Jesus.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.650
Oh, that's great!

00:30.650 --> 00:33.230
- And Jesus and I have an understanding.

00:33.230 --> 00:36.540
I don't fuck with Jesus and
Jesus doesn't fuck with me.

01:47.586 --> 01:48.440
- Hi, Sherry.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.460
Oh good morning, you must
be the new secretary.

01:51.460 --> 01:52.950
- Administrative assistant.

01:54.100 --> 01:54.933
- Oh.

01:54.933 --> 01:57.440
- I identify as androgynous
and gender fluid.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.620
When you refer to me, I
prefer you use the pronoun ze.

02:01.910 --> 02:03.960
- Grab me another latte, huh, sweetheart?

02:05.341 --> 02:08.280
Hey Carl.
- Where's Teddy?

02:08.280 --> 02:11.380
- In Bermuda, yachting
with one of my clients.

02:12.350 --> 02:13.800
- Why are you in his office?

02:13.800 --> 02:17.750
- Oh shit, they didn't tell you?

02:17.750 --> 02:18.750
- Tell me what?

02:21.972 --> 02:23.220
- Have a seat, Carl.

02:31.269 --> 02:33.440
When I was a boy, my father said to me,

02:34.670 --> 02:38.400
if you win something
with bad sportsmanship,

02:38.400 --> 02:39.950
you didn't win anything at all.

02:41.170 --> 02:44.140
That poor bastard died a broke cuckle.

02:45.450 --> 02:46.283
Now Carl,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.220
you've been a valuable
asset to the company

02:49.220 --> 02:51.410
and we really appreciate
all the things you've done

02:51.410 --> 02:52.930
for us throughout the years.

02:56.130 --> 02:58.830
But the company's moving
in a different direction.

02:58.830 --> 02:59.930
- What does that mean?

03:03.942 --> 03:06.140
- On behalf of Blumenthal,
Sanchez, and Ryan,

03:06.140 --> 03:08.360
we're gonna have to let you go.

03:08.360 --> 03:11.850
- You stole my clients, you
stole everyone's clients.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.780
This breaks my heart, Carl.

03:21.140 --> 03:22.420
You're such a nice guy.

03:26.660 --> 03:30.180
You keep your mouth shut
about my clients, okay?

04:03.250 --> 04:04.083
- Hello?

04:04.083 --> 04:05.120
Hey Carl, it's Ted Levine.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.170
Just calling you about
the interview yesterday.

04:08.340 --> 04:10.580
- Oh yeah, hey.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.540
Unfortunately, we've
decided we're going to move

04:13.540 --> 04:15.140
in a different direction.

04:15.140 --> 04:18.978
- No look, I've been out
of work for two months.

04:18.978 --> 04:22.340
I could do anything, anything at all.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.220
I could be someone's secretary.

04:25.220 --> 04:27.850
I mean, administrative assistant.

04:27.850 --> 04:30.180
Sorry Carl, I wish you the best.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.030
- Please--
- You're such a nice guy.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.720
- Who the hell is calling
at this hour, Carl?

04:46.690 --> 04:48.990
- It was just a telemarketer, honey.

05:22.315 --> 05:24.315
- Merry Christmas, Carl.

05:27.560 --> 05:28.393
Carl.

05:32.711 --> 05:33.544
Carl.

05:37.883 --> 05:38.716
Carl.

05:41.150 --> 05:41.983
Carl.

05:43.931 --> 05:44.764
Carl.

05:46.339 --> 05:47.172
Carl!

05:48.112 --> 05:49.279
Carl, wake up!

05:50.203 --> 05:53.690
Hello, wake up, Carl, earth to Carl!

05:53.690 --> 05:56.350
You need to get up right
now and go to the office

05:56.350 --> 06:00.070
because the Christmas bonus
is not delivering itself.

06:25.280 --> 06:27.630
The final
tiara goes to Bridget.

06:28.643 --> 06:31.258
- Hee-hee.
- Goddammit.

06:31.258 --> 06:33.050
- I like Bridget.

06:33.050 --> 06:34.040
- If you could only see
the dress she's wearing,

06:34.040 --> 06:35.570
you could see she's got no class.

06:35.570 --> 06:37.090
- She has a kind soul.

06:38.990 --> 06:41.610
- Only you, big bro, only you.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.733
Oh, thanks babe.

06:44.830 --> 06:46.330
Just gotta run a quick errand.

06:51.138 --> 06:51.971
- Here you go.

06:51.971 --> 06:53.050
- Thanks Jen.

06:55.340 --> 06:57.970
Pancakes.

07:05.780 --> 07:08.420
- Oh shit, I forgot my phone.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.830
- Hey Carl, it's Brett, I'm
in your neck of the woods,

07:30.830 --> 07:32.480
wanted to run something by you

07:32.480 --> 07:33.880
before we went to Grandpa's house.

07:33.880 --> 07:34.730
See you in a bit.

07:44.261 --> 07:46.024
- Hey, Ray, hey.
- Hey.

07:46.024 --> 07:47.150
- Hey, Jerry.
- Right.

07:47.150 --> 07:50.520
- Jerry Ryan I work with--
- With Carl, yeah, yeah.

07:50.520 --> 07:51.353
- Happy Hanukkah.

07:51.353 --> 07:52.970
- Yeah, no, happy holidays.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.120
- Right, I was actually just stopping by

07:55.120 --> 07:55.980
to see the bastard now.

07:55.980 --> 07:56.900
Is he up there?

07:56.900 --> 07:59.340
- Oh shit, he didn't tell you?

08:00.370 --> 08:02.490
They let him go a couple of months ago.

08:02.490 --> 08:04.700
Yeah, they got some prick
from Harvard or Yale

08:04.700 --> 08:07.050
doing his job at half the salary.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.296
- Really?

08:08.296 --> 08:09.129
- Yeah, I heard that poor
bastard ain't even found

08:09.129 --> 08:10.740
a job, yet, man.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.720
It's a tough market.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.740
It's fucking dog-eat-dog.

08:13.740 --> 08:14.920
Anyway, woof.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.420
All right, happy holidays,
pal, happy holidays.

08:18.420 --> 08:19.253
- Right.

08:40.150 --> 08:41.030
- Hey honey.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.580
- I can't find my wedding ring.

08:43.710 --> 08:46.220
- Oh no, geez.

08:47.100 --> 08:49.850
Well, I noticed you haven't
been wearing it lately.

08:49.850 --> 08:51.200
Have you seen it?

08:52.060 --> 08:54.100
- No, I, uh, no.

08:55.030 --> 08:56.590
I mean, did you check in the jewelry box?

08:56.590 --> 08:58.190
- Of course I checked the jewelry box.

08:58.190 --> 08:59.850
You don't think I checked the jewelry box,

08:59.850 --> 09:01.771
the one place the ring belongs?

09:01.771 --> 09:02.840
In the jewelry box.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.400
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.

09:05.400 --> 09:07.610
Well, I'm sure it'll turn up.

09:07.610 --> 09:09.540
Are you packed and ready
to go to Grandpa's?

09:09.540 --> 09:11.040
- Well, did you get the bonus?

09:13.700 --> 09:15.520
- Honey, you're gonna be mad.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.353
What?

09:19.130 --> 09:23.640
- I, well, they said, Jerry
said there was supposed to be

09:23.640 --> 09:26.070
a guy in the office from payroll today,

09:26.070 --> 09:27.880
but he didn't show up.

09:27.880 --> 09:29.600
- Okay, I wanna talk to your boss.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.860
Because if you're not gonna
be man enough to handle this,

09:31.860 --> 09:32.693
then I will handle it.

09:32.693 --> 09:33.580
I wanna talk to Teddy.

09:33.580 --> 09:36.550
- He's not here, Leigh,
it's Christmas Eve.

09:36.550 --> 09:37.460
No one's here.

09:37.460 --> 09:40.280
- We are late on the mortgage, Carl.

09:40.280 --> 09:41.860
You told me that they promised you

09:41.860 --> 09:44.150
the Christmas bonus today.

09:44.150 --> 09:44.983
Seriously?

09:48.170 --> 09:50.180
- Leigh! Leigh!

10:31.840 --> 10:33.340
- You the guy from Craigslist?

10:34.510 --> 10:36.280
- Why are you wearing a mask?

10:36.280 --> 10:38.160
- Why are you wearing a mask?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.360
- Just trying to be discreet

10:39.360 --> 10:41.980
on the off chance that we know each other.

10:41.980 --> 10:43.350
- All right, small world.

10:51.410 --> 10:52.330
You got the ring?

10:55.120 --> 10:58.420
Ah, yeah, look at that.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.790
My mamacita's gonna melt my butter

11:00.790 --> 11:03.060
when she sees this sparkling baby.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.910
- You never said why
you're wearing a mask.

11:04.910 --> 11:07.060
- Yeah, because I'm
here to fucking rob you.

11:07.060 --> 11:07.893
- No, no, no, no!
- Give me the money.

11:07.893 --> 11:09.378
- Give me the money!
- It's Christmas!

11:09.378 --> 11:12.533
- No, no, no!
- Merry Christmas.

11:12.533 --> 11:13.683
- Oh my God, oh my God.

11:18.588 --> 11:19.505
Fuck. Fuck.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.087
Doesn't look

12:58.087 --> 12:58.950
Are you sure he's here?

12:58.950 --> 13:01.208
No, no, no, he said
he had a doctor's appointment.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.664
She's gonna leave the door open.

13:22.353 --> 13:25.190
- Look at these architectural details.

13:25.190 --> 13:26.760
This woodwork is phenomenal.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.500
- Well, there's water
damage in both bathrooms.

13:30.360 --> 13:32.860
It looks like he hasn't
cleaned this place in 20 years.

13:32.860 --> 13:34.640
- It's a fixer-upper, I'll grant you that.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.570
But you can't ignore
the comfy, cozy quality

13:37.570 --> 13:39.400
of this bucolic beauty.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.620
I mean, just think of the
dinner parties we'll have here.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.630
All our friends coming up here to visit us

13:43.630 --> 13:46.490
in this regal, A-frame chateau.

13:47.790 --> 13:49.790
Now would you please give me
a little something-something

13:49.790 --> 13:51.490
under this yuletide mistletoe, hm?

13:53.620 --> 13:58.620
- Hello!
- Hey, Merry Christmas, Leigh.

13:58.910 --> 13:59.790
- Hello, Leigh.

14:01.026 --> 14:01.880
- Merry Christmas, Jen.

14:01.880 --> 14:04.200
Aren't you festive in your
little holiday sweater,

14:04.200 --> 14:06.309
you Christmasy thing, you.

14:06.309 --> 14:08.350
- Not nearly as festive as you, Leigh.

14:08.350 --> 14:09.900
- Well, just trying to bring holiday cheer

14:09.900 --> 14:12.630
to the royals in their future castle.

14:12.630 --> 14:14.050
- It's more of a dungeon.

14:14.050 --> 14:15.900
- Hey, Merry Christmas, Carl.

14:15.900 --> 14:16.900
- Merry Christmas.

14:19.240 --> 14:20.510
- I'm glad you brought your horn.

14:20.510 --> 14:22.880
- Yeah, I figured I'd
set the mood for romance

14:22.880 --> 14:24.510
in front of the ladies later on.

14:24.510 --> 14:27.490
- Nice, you gonna break
us out with some Kenny G?

14:27.490 --> 14:28.750
I'm breaking your balls.

14:28.750 --> 14:29.840
You look good, pal.

14:31.050 --> 14:32.080
Hey, any word from Grandpa?

14:32.080 --> 14:32.913
How's he doing?

14:32.913 --> 14:35.450
- So the doctors just wanted
to run some last-minute tests

14:35.450 --> 14:37.970
on his arrhythmia, but turns
out he's healthy as a lark,

14:37.970 --> 14:39.510
God bless his soul.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.380
- It's healthy as a horse.

14:42.610 --> 14:44.040
- Whatever.

14:44.040 --> 14:45.990
- Happy as a lark.

14:45.990 --> 14:47.160
- What's a lark?

14:47.160 --> 14:48.860
- It's a festive little woodland bird.

14:48.860 --> 14:52.040
They grace the forest with
their graceful morning songs.

14:52.040 --> 14:54.390
That's where the saying comes from.

14:54.390 --> 14:57.230
I guess they're pretty
happy-go-lucky little creatures.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.600
- You are just a plethora
of useless information,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.200
aren't you, Carl?

15:02.200 --> 15:04.000
Now would you tote the bags, please?

15:05.150 --> 15:07.250
- Nothing wrong with having
an appreciation for nature

15:07.250 --> 15:08.790
that I'm aware of.

15:08.790 --> 15:09.623
- What?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.280
So, anyway, uh,

15:14.280 --> 15:17.100
I was thinking we should just
have the business conversation

15:17.100 --> 15:20.700
up front, so it's not looming
over us all weekend long.

15:20.700 --> 15:23.520
I know it's a little awkward
that Grandpa's giving us

15:23.520 --> 15:25.500
the 2.2 million and you guys are getting

15:25.500 --> 15:27.470
this really cute house.

15:27.470 --> 15:29.490
But I was thinking, you know,

15:29.490 --> 15:32.190
maybe we should just respect
his judgment and move on.

15:33.910 --> 15:35.110
- We've moved on, Leigh.

15:36.178 --> 15:38.830
- Oh great, we need to
get a Christmas tree up

15:38.830 --> 15:40.078
in this house.

15:43.196 --> 15:45.370
So, what's it like taking care of Ray?

15:45.370 --> 15:49.180
- Ugh, he eats and shits like a gorilla.

15:49.180 --> 15:51.620
It's like taking care of a zoo animal.

15:51.620 --> 15:54.520
There, I said it, terrible.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.830
- You're a saint, Jen.
- Mm-mm.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.110
- It drives me to drink.

15:58.110 --> 16:00.520
And don't even get me started on Brett.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.250
- Why, what's wrong?

16:04.177 --> 16:05.420
- He goes off at night to write.

16:05.420 --> 16:07.210
God knows where he really goes.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.070
- You don't think Brett's...

16:12.750 --> 16:14.574
No way, what, with who?

16:14.574 --> 16:16.478
- I don't wanna to think
about that, okay, Leigh?

16:16.478 --> 16:17.311
- Okay.

16:23.908 --> 16:25.460
If it makes you feel any better,

16:25.460 --> 16:29.000
I thought Carl was cheating
on me a few years back.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.470
- Carl would never cheat, you
have him on a choke chain.

16:31.470 --> 16:33.340
- I'm telling you, I kept catching him

16:33.340 --> 16:34.740
in all these little white lies.

16:34.740 --> 16:38.370
So one day, I trailed the
bastard on the way to work.

16:38.370 --> 16:42.270
I watch as he walks into
this garden-level apartment.

16:42.270 --> 16:43.780
Lights turn on.

16:43.780 --> 16:47.380
He sits down, and some guy walks over

16:47.380 --> 16:50.190
and starts running his
fingers through Carl's hair.

16:51.220 --> 16:53.847
And then I look over and I see the sign.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.530
Dr. Lipschitz, Cosmetic Surgeon.

16:57.530 --> 16:59.290
Yeah, I caught the bastard, all right.

16:59.290 --> 17:02.340
He was having hair implantation surgery.

17:02.340 --> 17:03.450
- Carl has plugs?

17:03.450 --> 17:06.700
- Yeah, don't you ever tell anyone.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.680
- But he's got such great hair.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.180
- Well, now you know why.

17:16.329 --> 17:18.430
- This place is really nice.

17:18.430 --> 17:20.359
You got lovely old school charm.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.079
- Don't bullshit me, Carl,
this place is a fucking dump.

17:23.079 --> 17:24.599
Hey, did you get a haircut or something?

17:24.599 --> 17:25.710
Looks different.

17:25.710 --> 17:28.770
- Oh, I started combing it different.

17:28.770 --> 17:30.230
Does it look okay, or?

17:31.573 --> 17:33.760
- Yeah, it's good, it's
a good look for you.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.580
Let's get that fireplace cracking, Carl.

17:40.780 --> 17:42.450
- How did you get away with it?

17:42.450 --> 17:44.920
I mean, how did you tell
Jen you got laid off?

17:44.920 --> 17:47.550
- Laid off, Carl, I volunteered.

17:47.550 --> 17:49.286
I told my boss if it came down to mine

17:49.286 --> 17:51.290
or someone else in my department's head

17:51.290 --> 17:54.350
going on that chopping
block, let it be mine.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.630
I obviously never told Jen that,

17:56.630 --> 17:58.560
but that's how it all went down.

17:58.560 --> 18:00.130
That's on the DL, by the way.

18:00.130 --> 18:01.970
- Oh yeah, I'd never say anything.

18:03.140 --> 18:06.910
- Carl, I'm gonna say
something right now that's,

18:07.800 --> 18:09.630
it's a funny thing to say out loud.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.140
And I'm only admitting
to it because I know

18:11.140 --> 18:13.190
that you'd never say
anything to the wifeys.

18:13.190 --> 18:14.080
- Of course not.

18:15.410 --> 18:18.154
- I've been having all
these crazy dreams lately

18:18.154 --> 18:21.233
about what it might be
like to euthanize Grandpa.

18:21.233 --> 18:24.210
What?

18:24.210 --> 18:26.070
- Don't bullshit me, Carl.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.660
I know you've been having them, too.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.850
You got that 2.2 mill
coming down the pipe.

18:31.830 --> 18:34.480
Let's think, that longevity
on that side of the family.

18:34.480 --> 18:38.413
Come on, new hip here,
heart surgery there.

18:38.413 --> 18:41.690
Putting him in a fucking home?

18:41.690 --> 18:42.880
Carl, that leaves your inheritance

18:42.880 --> 18:44.800
like it's a blue plate special.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.020
And you're telling me you
haven't had any dreams?

18:50.376 --> 18:51.340
- What?

18:51.340 --> 18:53.560
- Come on, Carl, we're fantasizing.

18:55.240 --> 18:56.270
In my fantasy,

18:58.270 --> 18:59.870
I usually get him with a little rat poison

18:59.870 --> 19:00.930
in his prune juice.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.000
It's the least detectable.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.910
I mean, not that they'd
ever do an autopsy.

19:08.630 --> 19:10.650
They rarely do on the elderly.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.100
They just assume they go
out on their own accord.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.110
So what about you?

19:17.057 --> 19:17.890
How have you been getting?

19:21.230 --> 19:23.720
- I, uh, I can't believe
I'm telling you this.

19:26.052 --> 19:27.780
I pushed him down the stairs.

19:27.780 --> 19:29.010
- Nice.

19:29.010 --> 19:31.370
No fingerprints, smart.

19:32.800 --> 19:33.633
What else?

19:34.726 --> 19:37.090
- I suffocate him with his pillow.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.580
- You animal.

19:38.580 --> 19:41.150
- Oh, and I bludgeon him with an anvil.

19:41.150 --> 19:42.750
Is that cliche?

19:42.750 --> 19:46.270
Carl, you're a scary guy,
you're scaring me.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.490
- You're a crazy guy.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.410
- It's fun talking about
stuff like this, isn't it?

19:51.410 --> 19:53.650
It's fun to fantasize.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.790
- It's sick is what it is.

19:55.790 --> 19:58.097
We're a couple of sick puppies.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.320
- It just seems like you're always getting

20:07.320 --> 20:09.130
the shit end of the stick, Carl.

20:09.130 --> 20:10.380
And it breaks my heart.

20:11.260 --> 20:13.570
I mean, you're my brother-in-law
and I care about you,

20:13.570 --> 20:14.910
I really do.

20:14.910 --> 20:17.150
- I care about you, too.

20:17.150 --> 20:17.983
So what are you saying?

20:17.983 --> 20:19.810
- I'm saying I drove
over here a few weeks ago

20:19.810 --> 20:21.220
to take care of things.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.220
- Take care of what?

20:23.268 --> 20:24.760
- What have we been talking about, Carl?

20:24.760 --> 20:28.530
I came here to stake our
claim, to put him to sleep.

20:28.530 --> 20:30.480
- Geez, Brett.

20:30.480 --> 20:31.710
- Don't bullshit me, Carl.

20:31.710 --> 20:32.750
I know you've been thinking it, too.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.400
We just established this.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.720
- Thinking it, maybe, but
what you're saying is,

20:36.720 --> 20:39.390
I mean, there's a big
difference between thinking--

20:39.390 --> 20:42.360
- And doing, exactly.

20:42.360 --> 20:45.990
The difference is ultimately
what defines a man's character.

20:45.990 --> 20:48.580
So as I'm driving onto
his street that night,

20:48.580 --> 20:50.000
I start thinking about you.

20:51.160 --> 20:53.690
How maybe this was the type
of thing that you needed

20:53.690 --> 20:54.523
to be doing.

20:55.563 --> 20:57.540
And instantly, the following
thoughts start permeating

20:57.540 --> 20:58.430
into my mind.

20:58.430 --> 21:01.130
And I'm only saying this because
you're my brother-in-law.

21:01.130 --> 21:05.110
I start hearing, "He's a
loser, he'll only fuck it up.

21:05.110 --> 21:08.900
"He's anxious guy, those people
push him around all day."

21:08.900 --> 21:12.290
And then I thought, no, no,
no, no, that's not true.

21:12.290 --> 21:15.380
I thought my faithlessness
in you is based completely

21:15.380 --> 21:17.460
on all the bullshit lies
you've been telling yourself

21:17.460 --> 21:18.980
all these years.

21:18.980 --> 21:22.120
That you believe these
lies so much about yourself

21:22.120 --> 21:24.660
that you've got me believing in them, too.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.420
And that's when I
realized, he can do this.

21:28.420 --> 21:30.720
In fact, he needs to do this.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.690
And who am I to deprive
him of that opportunity?

21:35.600 --> 21:37.320
So I pulled into his neighbor's driveway,

21:37.320 --> 21:39.250
turned around, and headed home.

21:39.250 --> 21:41.620
Because for me, this is nothing.

21:41.620 --> 21:42.770
I'm there already.

21:42.770 --> 21:46.520
I'm living the dream, Carl,
and I don't give a fuck.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.353
But for you,

21:48.230 --> 21:49.063
for you,

21:50.270 --> 21:51.670
this could be life-changing.

21:52.580 --> 21:56.340
This could be the first step
down the road less traveled.

21:58.377 --> 21:59.990
- I'm not murdering my wife's grandfather

21:59.990 --> 22:01.030
if that's what you're talking about.

22:01.030 --> 22:02.530
- Don't use that word, Carl.

22:03.849 --> 22:05.199
We're putting him to sleep.

22:06.555 --> 22:09.410
Be the hero, Carl.

22:09.410 --> 22:12.980
Be the one who makes all of
our holiday wishes come true.

22:14.570 --> 22:18.790
Freshen up his tea with
a little bit of this.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.820
We'll celebrate in the morning.

22:26.820 --> 22:30.020
I'll cook you some flapjacks.

22:35.916 --> 22:38.545
It's
Beckham, sprinting away!

22:38.545 --> 22:41.589
- Go, go, go, go, go, yes!

22:41.589 --> 22:42.589
- Haha, woo!

22:43.570 --> 22:46.200
That is what I am talking about!

22:46.200 --> 22:48.390
Cheers to the Giants bringing us home

22:48.390 --> 22:50.570
the shiny Lombardi trophy.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.460
- Mm-mm, do you think they'll bring that

22:54.460 --> 22:55.570
over to your house later

22:55.570 --> 22:57.790
or do you think they'll
swing on over to my place

22:57.790 --> 22:58.740
for Brett to enjoy?

23:00.420 --> 23:02.200
- Looks like you're
having a little too much

23:02.200 --> 23:03.360
holiday cheer, Jen.

23:04.340 --> 23:05.910
You're getting weird.

23:05.910 --> 23:07.580
- Yeah, let's start
phasing out the egg nog

23:07.580 --> 23:09.180
and start introducing the water.

23:10.310 --> 23:12.360
- I think I'm entitled to a drink or two.

23:13.674 --> 23:16.390
I worked all week.

23:18.963 --> 23:20.850
- What the fuck is going on here?

23:21.742 --> 23:22.575
- Grandpa!

23:25.230 --> 23:27.940
- You walk around my living
room with your shoes on?

23:27.940 --> 23:30.270
We take our shoes off
when we walk around here.

23:30.270 --> 23:32.160
- Is everything okay, Grandpa?

23:32.160 --> 23:34.910
- Healthy as a 50-year-old,
that's what he said.

23:34.910 --> 23:37.050
Of course, my first wife died at 50.

23:39.091 --> 23:40.867
I don't listen to any of
those lying bastards anyway.

23:40.867 --> 23:42.307
- Well, you look wonderful, Kenny.

23:42.307 --> 23:43.140
You look like a 50-year-old.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.510
- Bullshit, pal, human
beings don't look wonderful

23:45.510 --> 23:46.343
at my age.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.530
We look like overgrown prunes.

23:48.530 --> 23:49.670
And I'll tell you something,

23:49.670 --> 23:52.340
some day you'll look just like this, okay?

23:52.340 --> 23:54.600
So save all that bullshit for someone

23:54.600 --> 23:56.250
you're trying to stick you're dick in.

23:57.370 --> 23:58.360
- Hi Grandpa.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.010
- Oh, will you look at this?

24:03.010 --> 24:05.530
You're right, Leigh,
she's becoming a lush.

24:05.530 --> 24:07.112
- Here we go.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.080
- What a shame to be given
the wonderful gift of life,

24:10.080 --> 24:11.660
just to drink it all away.

24:12.650 --> 24:15.380
- Do you remember Carl, Grandpa?

24:15.380 --> 24:17.740
- I can't say he made
much of an impression.

24:19.663 --> 24:20.770
Does he talk?

24:20.770 --> 24:22.349
Do you talk, you say something?

24:23.256 --> 24:24.089
Well, what are you, a man or a mouse?

24:24.089 --> 24:26.630
- I'm a man.
- Bullshit you are.

24:26.630 --> 24:28.110
- Women are the new men.

24:28.110 --> 24:30.440
Clits are the new cocks.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.273
Cocks are clits.

24:31.273 --> 24:33.390
It's all topsy-turvy now.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.850
- Be nice, Grandpa.

24:35.850 --> 24:38.150
- They're coming out of the woodwork.

24:38.150 --> 24:40.180
- Happy 80th, Mr. Larkin.

24:40.180 --> 24:43.010
- Ah see, the only one to say it.

24:43.010 --> 24:44.740
What the hell happened to you?

24:44.740 --> 24:48.960
- I was in an accident in Afghanistan.

24:48.960 --> 24:50.784
- You're a soldier?

24:50.784 --> 24:51.617
- I was.

24:51.617 --> 24:52.970
Do you even know what we're fuck

24:52.970 --> 24:53.930
you were doing over there?

24:53.930 --> 24:56.090
- We're fighting terrorists, Grandpa.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.820
We're putting an end to terrorism.

24:57.820 --> 25:00.020
- And we're damn proud of you, Ray.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.010
- Terrorists, we're all terrorists.

25:04.890 --> 25:07.540
What, I can't open my mouth up anymore?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.850
- We love you, Grandpa.

25:11.392 --> 25:13.681
- Are you gonna give her a baby?

25:13.681 --> 25:16.100
Or is she gonna waste her
life waiting for some drip

25:16.100 --> 25:17.690
to perform like man?

25:17.690 --> 25:19.620
You know, she's not getting any younger.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.070
Her oven is getting cold.

25:21.070 --> 25:22.300
- In due time, Kenny.

25:23.290 --> 25:25.170
Everything in due time.

25:25.170 --> 25:26.610
- You mean like menopause?

25:28.290 --> 25:29.900
Where are you going Grandpa?

25:29.900 --> 25:31.750
- I'm going to feed some raccoons.

25:32.870 --> 25:35.370
You know, you feed them
lunch and then they come back

25:35.370 --> 25:38.070
and try to eat their way
back into your fucking house.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.372
- Okay.

27:16.950 --> 27:17.783
- Oh hi, Kenny.

27:17.783 --> 27:18.740
- What are you doing up?

27:20.304 --> 27:22.180
- I was wondering, are
there any extra blankets?

27:22.180 --> 27:24.767
- Ah, did that heater go out again?

27:24.767 --> 27:25.600
Geez.

27:27.763 --> 27:29.450
Listen, I didn't mean anything
about what I said before,

27:29.450 --> 27:32.190
you know, it's just that
these wars just piss me off.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.760
- That's okay, it didn't bother me.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.860
- Have some tea, I've
got some water boiling.

27:37.860 --> 27:39.410
I'll give you some Sleepytime.

27:39.410 --> 27:40.470
- Oh no, that's okay.

27:40.470 --> 27:42.420
- You like honey, I got
honey, too, upstairs.

27:42.420 --> 27:43.270
All right, honey?

27:44.340 --> 27:45.173
- Okay.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.060
- Happy birthday.

28:16.060 --> 28:19.240
- Eh, it's no big deal, you know.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.290
But one thing I have learned,

28:21.290 --> 28:24.260
and that is you have to
celebrate every day you're here,

28:24.260 --> 28:26.440
because it's over before you even know

28:26.440 --> 28:27.540
what the hell hit you.

28:28.621 --> 28:29.800
- You're happy, though.

28:29.800 --> 28:31.300
I mean, you had a good life.

28:31.300 --> 28:33.310
- Hey, I'm not dead yet, all right.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.410
Don't go burying me, for God's sake.

28:35.410 --> 28:37.600
- No, no, no.
- Thank you for throwing

28:37.600 --> 28:40.520
dirt on me.
- No, I meant to say so far.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.145
- I'm teasing you, the old
man's just teasing you.

28:43.145 --> 28:43.978
Don't get upset.

28:50.060 --> 28:51.030
- Do I smell weed?

28:54.371 --> 28:57.190
- Yeah, I've been smoking since the '60s.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.600
Yeah, they were good times then, you know?

29:01.600 --> 29:04.840
We almost made a difference, here.

29:04.840 --> 29:05.673
- Oh.

29:08.160 --> 29:08.993
- It's kind.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.320
- It's kind he says.

29:21.227 --> 29:22.060
- Yeah?

29:22.060 --> 29:22.893
Yeah, it is.

29:29.310 --> 29:30.143
- Hey.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.330
Hey Carl.

29:34.330 --> 29:36.690
- I can't sleep.

29:36.690 --> 29:38.320
- Something on your mind, pal?

29:38.320 --> 29:42.190
- Oh no, nothing,
nothing worth mentioning.

29:42.190 --> 29:45.130
- Wrestle with the demons,
they come out at night.

29:46.070 --> 29:46.903
- Yeah.

29:48.150 --> 29:49.800
- Hey, come in here, have a seat.

29:50.940 --> 29:53.660
- Yeah, have a seat, Carl.

30:01.829 --> 30:04.830
Hey, you want a pull?

30:04.830 --> 30:07.210
- Oh, no, no, it doesn't agree with me.

30:07.210 --> 30:08.600
I get paranoid.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.140
- Ah, not on this stuff you won't.

30:10.140 --> 30:11.390
You'll be asleep before you even know

30:11.390 --> 30:12.650
what the hell hit you.

30:12.650 --> 30:14.150
- She won't know.

30:15.153 --> 30:16.170
- Yeah, relax, huh.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.201
You know, you're on vacation here, pal.

30:21.859 --> 30:24.370
You've got a lot of tension
in those shoulders, you know?

30:33.248 --> 30:34.850
- You have very strong hands.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.640
- Well, they have to be
strong to work the soil.

30:37.640 --> 30:40.050
We have to have more reverence
for the soil, you know?

30:40.050 --> 30:42.860
They're destroying, they
destroy everything that's good.

30:42.860 --> 30:44.890
Like they killed that young Kennedy boy.

30:44.890 --> 30:47.900
He wasn't afraid to stand up
to them, so they killed him.

30:49.130 --> 30:51.290
That's how you know
you're a good president,

30:51.290 --> 30:52.570
when they kill you.

30:52.570 --> 30:57.570
- Wow, when they kill
you, you know you're good.

30:57.895 --> 30:59.330
That's right, sure.

30:59.330 --> 31:02.270
We kill our heroes and
we praise our villains

31:02.270 --> 31:03.910
and give them all kinds of awards.

31:03.910 --> 31:06.760
It's a very topsy-turvy land.

31:06.760 --> 31:09.520
- When we die, do you think we grow wings

31:09.520 --> 31:11.500
and go to a better place?

31:11.500 --> 31:14.220
- Yeah, yeah, we become plants.

31:14.220 --> 31:16.020
And then we become angels.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.720
- Just like plants.

31:17.720 --> 31:20.884
- Sure, we're all angels deep down inside.

31:25.790 --> 31:27.480
How about you, you have something to say?

31:27.480 --> 31:28.840
You wanna speak up here?

31:28.840 --> 31:30.440
- Well, my mouth is dry.

31:30.440 --> 31:31.440
- You want some tea?

31:32.930 --> 31:33.850
- Sleepytime is good.

31:33.850 --> 31:36.849
- Uh yeah, I, yeah, I'll
have, that sounds good.

31:36.849 --> 31:37.875
- All right, let me get you some.

31:37.875 --> 31:38.802
- No, I'll get it.

31:38.802 --> 31:41.220
- I'll get it, relax.
- No, no, I'll get it.

31:41.220 --> 31:45.760
- Sorry, Kenny, do you
want some more hot water?

31:45.760 --> 31:49.560
- Yeah, yeah, I just need a
little more water, thanks.

32:25.825 --> 32:29.890
I don't

32:29.890 --> 32:31.060
- Well, you know, nice
to have a little service

32:31.060 --> 32:34.060
every now and then, you know, right?

32:36.990 --> 32:39.980
You're sweaty and you're a little pale.

32:39.980 --> 32:41.820
Yeah, what's on your mind, pal?

32:42.690 --> 32:45.130
- It's, uh, nothing.

32:45.130 --> 32:47.800
- Well, remember this, whatever it is,

32:47.800 --> 32:49.330
listen to what's deep down inside.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.810
Don't listen to what they want you to do.

32:50.810 --> 32:52.757
You have a choice.

32:52.757 --> 32:53.970
You always have a choice.

32:53.970 --> 32:56.140
Unless they put you in
one of those prisons.

32:56.140 --> 32:56.973
- I don't wanna be,

32:56.973 --> 32:59.860
I'm tired of being locked up.

32:59.860 --> 33:01.618
Then get out.

33:01.618 --> 33:06.488
- He's a very smart man, you
should listen to him, Carl.

33:06.488 --> 33:09.629
You should get out, let yourself go.

33:09.629 --> 33:12.310
- Yes, it's no good carrying
around this tension.

33:12.310 --> 33:15.050
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

33:15.050 --> 33:16.970
You probably clogged up all your arteries

33:16.970 --> 33:18.620
with all that worry.

33:19.693 --> 33:23.877
- Do you know, do you
know what's going on?

33:23.877 --> 33:28.460
- Hey, if you smoke the right
plants, you know everything.

33:32.470 --> 33:34.640
- What's so funny guys,
is something funny?

33:48.626 --> 33:50.459
- Who wants breakfast?

34:02.352 --> 34:03.457
♪ Over the river and through the woods ♪

34:03.457 --> 34:05.824
♪ To Grandmother's house we go ♪

34:05.824 --> 34:07.776

34:07.776 --> 34:09.791

34:13.940 --> 34:15.870
- Thank you Brett, those look amazing.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.710
- Hopefully they taste amazing.

34:17.710 --> 34:18.800
Hey babe, good morning.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.710
- Good morning.

34:20.960 --> 34:22.590
You're chipper this morning.

34:22.590 --> 34:24.699
- Yeah, there's a lot to
be chipper about, babe.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.330
All of us gathering as a family

34:26.330 --> 34:28.750
makes me feel kind of
warm and tingly inside.

34:28.750 --> 34:29.583
Feels good.

34:30.570 --> 34:31.900
Feels good to be alive.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.889
Well, well, well,

34:36.139 --> 34:39.500
look who's finally decided to
grace us with his presence.

34:39.500 --> 34:41.070
Good morning, sunshine.

34:41.070 --> 34:42.719
- Good morning.

34:42.719 --> 34:43.780
- Looks like someone got a little visit

34:43.780 --> 34:46.020
from the hair fairy, huh, honey?

34:46.020 --> 34:46.900
Sorry.

34:47.969 --> 34:49.699
- What are you sorry about?

34:50.775 --> 34:51.880
- I don't know.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.790
You all right, pal?

34:53.790 --> 34:55.159
- I'm fine.

34:55.159 --> 34:56.650
- He's always like this in the morning.

34:56.650 --> 34:59.050
He's a total zombie
until he has his coffee.

34:59.050 --> 35:00.200
Isn't that right, Carl?

35:01.420 --> 35:02.850
- Yeah.

35:02.850 --> 35:05.350
- Well, let's get you set up, then, pal.

35:05.350 --> 35:06.210
How do you take it?

35:06.210 --> 35:07.940
- Huh?
- He really is a zombie.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.140
- How do you take your coffee, bro?

35:09.140 --> 35:11.400
- Earth to Fog, come in Fog.

35:11.400 --> 35:14.100
- Oh, regular, I take it regular.

35:14.100 --> 35:17.050
- Snap out of it Carl,
you're embarrassing yourself.

35:17.050 --> 35:18.850
- Hey, shouldn't Grandpa be up by now?

35:18.850 --> 35:20.250
I thought he always
rose with the roosters.

35:20.250 --> 35:22.420
- You know what, he went to
bed pretty early last night.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.850
Maybe someone should check on him.

35:23.850 --> 35:25.150
- I'd like to finish my drink

35:25.150 --> 35:27.910
before having to deal with
him, thank you very much.

35:27.910 --> 35:29.710
- Yeah, well, I'll check on him

35:29.710 --> 35:31.320
because I'm starting to get worried.

35:31.320 --> 35:32.153
- Oh don't.

35:33.390 --> 35:34.520
- What?

35:34.520 --> 35:36.560
- Let him sleep, he probably needs it.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.590
They need their sleep at that age.

35:38.590 --> 35:41.320
- It's 10:00 a.m. Carl,
I'm checking on him.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.490
- Don't, don't go in there, Leigh.

35:43.490 --> 35:46.010
Why shouldn't
she go in there, Carl?

35:46.010 --> 35:47.540
- Because he's...

35:48.740 --> 35:50.310
He's what?

35:50.310 --> 35:52.570
He's what, Carl?

35:52.570 --> 35:54.990
- He's, he's dead.

35:56.708 --> 35:58.100
What?

35:58.100 --> 36:01.680
- He passed away, he must've
gone in his sleep or something.

36:01.680 --> 36:02.700
I'm sorry.

36:02.700 --> 36:03.810
How do you know?

36:04.814 --> 36:06.100
What happened?

36:06.100 --> 36:07.500
- I went in there early this morning

36:07.500 --> 36:08.780
looking for some matches.

36:08.780 --> 36:11.240
And I asked him if he had some

36:11.240 --> 36:12.750
and he wasn't saying anything.

36:12.750 --> 36:16.475
So I went over to him, and I shook him,

36:16.475 --> 36:19.270
and he wouldn't wake up.

36:19.270 --> 36:21.040
I put my fingers under his nose

36:21.040 --> 36:23.570
and he wasn't breathing, so I,

36:23.570 --> 36:25.370
I didn't know what to do, so I just,

36:26.280 --> 36:29.260
I just kept checking
and there was nothing.

36:29.260 --> 36:31.150
He was gone.

36:31.150 --> 36:31.983
He's gone.

36:35.204 --> 36:36.690
- Well, what are we gonna do?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.740
I mean, what are we gonna do with him?

36:41.222 --> 36:43.037
- Well, I guess we call 911.

36:43.037 --> 36:45.560
None of us should go up
there and look at him.

36:45.560 --> 36:49.200
He's probably all blue or
whatever color they turn.

36:52.230 --> 36:53.910
- Why didn't you do something

36:53.910 --> 36:56.450
or tell us something last night?

36:56.450 --> 36:57.283
- Well, what was I gonna do?

36:57.283 --> 36:59.420
He wasn't breathing, he was dead.

36:59.420 --> 37:00.460
- If someone's not breathing,

37:00.460 --> 37:02.130
it doesn't necessarily mean they're dead.

37:02.130 --> 37:03.550
- He wasn't breathing for a long time.

37:03.550 --> 37:05.100
I checked several times.

37:05.100 --> 37:06.220
I kept checking.

37:06.220 --> 37:07.450
- Well, for how long?

37:07.450 --> 37:09.090
How long wasn't he breathing?

37:09.090 --> 37:10.880
Two or three
minutes, I don't know.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.250
- And you didn't try to revive him?

37:12.250 --> 37:14.320
- Yeah, why didn't you
try to revive him, Carl?

37:14.320 --> 37:17.390
- I don't know, okay, I don't know, geez.

37:17.390 --> 37:18.670
- You said you went in there for matches.

37:18.670 --> 37:19.950
Why did you need matches?

37:19.950 --> 37:22.660
- To light a fire, I
wanted to light a fire.

37:22.660 --> 37:23.970
It was freezing in that room.

37:23.970 --> 37:27.130
I feel like I'm on the freaking
stand right now, okay, geez.

37:27.130 --> 37:28.860
- It wasn't even cold last night.

37:28.860 --> 37:31.160
- 'Cause you stole all
the covers, you always do.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.190
It was freezing.

37:32.190 --> 37:34.030
- There's no fireplace in that room.

37:35.488 --> 37:36.473
Where were you going to light it?

37:36.473 --> 37:37.306
- In the den.

37:37.306 --> 37:39.016
I was gonna sleep on the couch in the den.

37:39.016 --> 37:40.830
This is ridiculous.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.888
- You're a real idiot Carl, you know that?

37:42.888 --> 37:45.140
You're a real idiot, Carl.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.820
- I didn't kill him, okay, honey?

37:48.530 --> 37:50.220
- Who said anything about killing him?

37:50.220 --> 37:51.830
- Yeah, it sounds like you're saying it.

37:51.830 --> 37:52.790
- Why would you say that?

37:52.790 --> 37:54.960
Why would you say that, Carl?

37:54.960 --> 37:56.150
- Because I was...

37:58.480 --> 38:00.510
- What, you were what?

38:01.620 --> 38:04.150
- You were what, Carl?

38:04.150 --> 38:06.730
Say something Carl, think Carl!

38:16.392 --> 38:18.270
- Well, what happened?

38:18.270 --> 38:19.840
- Sleep apnea.

38:19.840 --> 38:20.673
- Huh?

38:20.673 --> 38:23.595
- He has sleep apnea, Leigh just told me.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.590
You can stop breathing for
several minutes in your sleep.

38:25.590 --> 38:28.103
- But you gave him the tea, right?

38:28.103 --> 38:29.803
He drank it, you saw him drink it?

38:31.950 --> 38:32.783
What?

38:33.640 --> 38:35.340
- I didn't do it.

38:35.340 --> 38:36.300
- What?

38:36.300 --> 38:38.550
- I didn't put any rat poison in his tea.

38:38.550 --> 38:39.720
I couldn't do it.

38:39.720 --> 38:40.590
Why not?

38:40.590 --> 38:42.230
- Because he was saying
all this crazy stuff

38:42.230 --> 38:44.370
that was freaking me out.

38:44.370 --> 38:47.130
I finally went back in
there this morning to

38:47.130 --> 38:48.330
smother him with his pillow,

38:48.330 --> 38:50.670
and I was standing there for a long time

38:50.670 --> 38:54.340
just looking at him, and I
noticed that he wasn't breathing.

38:54.340 --> 38:57.430
So I put my fingers under
his nose and he wasn't.

38:57.430 --> 38:59.650
So I thought my job was
done for me, you know,

38:59.650 --> 39:02.490
by God or whatever.

39:03.620 --> 39:08.032
- Okay, okay, so we'll try again tonight.

39:08.032 --> 39:10.210
No problem.

39:10.210 --> 39:11.450
You can do it tonight.

39:11.450 --> 39:12.480
- Uh uh, no way.

39:13.550 --> 39:14.740
- Why not?

39:14.740 --> 39:15.630
- I can't.

39:15.630 --> 39:16.770
- What do you mean you can't?

39:16.770 --> 39:18.810
- It'll freak me out way too much, Brett.

39:18.810 --> 39:20.340
You saw the girls.

39:20.340 --> 39:22.340
Did you notice how upset Leigh was?

39:22.340 --> 39:24.040
- Leigh is gonna be fine.

39:24.040 --> 39:26.185
With all your financial
burdens put to rest,

39:26.185 --> 39:28.670
she'll get over this
very quickly, trust me.

39:28.670 --> 39:31.280
- But Kenny, he's, he's
a human being, Brett.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.110
- Bullshit, he's a fucking dinosaur

39:33.110 --> 39:35.500
who should've been
extinct a long time ago.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.870
Do you have any idea what
it's like getting Ray in

39:37.870 --> 39:39.010
on his appointments nowadays

39:39.010 --> 39:41.820
with all these prehistoric
animals roaming the earth

39:41.820 --> 39:43.880
and sucking up all the doctors' time?

39:43.880 --> 39:44.713
He'd die waiting.

39:44.713 --> 39:47.330
And resources, to have them around

39:47.330 --> 39:49.380
for all these unnecessary years.

39:49.380 --> 39:51.130
The carbon footprint, Carl.

39:51.130 --> 39:52.880
We're overpopulated.

39:52.880 --> 39:55.460
And you call yourself a nature enthusiast?

39:55.460 --> 39:57.140
Not exactly eco-friendly.

39:58.605 --> 39:59.438
I've digressed.

40:00.542 --> 40:04.153
Look, to make an omelette,
you have to break an egg.

40:04.153 --> 40:06.880
- I'm not breaking any eggs, I'm sorry.

40:06.880 --> 40:07.730
There's just,

40:09.030 --> 40:11.640
there's just something
inside of me telling me no.

40:12.730 --> 40:14.230
- So you're a pussy, Carl.

40:14.230 --> 40:15.280
- I'm sorry, Brett.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.383
- Okay.

40:20.630 --> 40:21.463
Okay.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.600
I want you to see that
inheritance now, Carl.

40:25.600 --> 40:26.550
Really see it.

40:27.550 --> 40:31.270
2.2 million dollars.

40:31.270 --> 40:34.930
And now, I want you to see
how you're deliberately

40:34.930 --> 40:37.940
flushing it deep down into
the shit-covered waters

40:37.940 --> 40:39.570
of shit's fucking creek,

40:39.570 --> 40:42.540
where it's devoured by all
of the little shit-eaters.

40:42.540 --> 40:44.490
Really see yourself now, Carl,

40:44.490 --> 40:46.130
just waving goodbye to it,

40:46.130 --> 40:48.280
with that sorry little look on your face,

40:48.280 --> 40:51.560
and a paddle stuck up your
ass that was jammed in there

40:51.560 --> 40:53.950
by an unfair world that
you weren't man enough

40:53.950 --> 40:55.190
to stake your claim in.

40:57.410 --> 40:58.540
Nothing.

40:58.540 --> 41:00.070
Nothing to say, Carl?

41:00.070 --> 41:01.513
- We were drinking yesterday

41:01.513 --> 41:03.840
and we were caught up in
too much holiday cheer

41:03.840 --> 41:05.190
and goofing around when we--

41:05.190 --> 41:07.160
- Oh, I see, so you think the one holding

41:07.160 --> 41:08.810
the shit end of the
stick should be the one

41:08.810 --> 41:10.140
that carries this out, huh?

41:10.140 --> 41:11.390
Is that what you think, Carl?

41:11.390 --> 41:13.720
You think I should be the
one that has to do this?

41:15.642 --> 41:18.240
- I've stated my position, and,

41:19.920 --> 41:21.190
I'm not gonna waver.

41:22.290 --> 41:23.440
I'm standing my ground.

41:30.010 --> 41:31.160
- I think you'll do it.

41:32.830 --> 41:33.663
- Huh?

41:34.586 --> 41:36.410
- I think you'd rather kill Grampy

41:36.410 --> 41:38.330
than deal with the
ramifications of your wife

41:38.330 --> 41:40.010
finding out the truth.

41:40.010 --> 41:41.570
- About what?

41:41.570 --> 41:43.700
- I ran into Jerry Ryan yesterday.

41:44.800 --> 41:45.633
Yeah.

41:47.050 --> 41:49.300
Does Leigh know that
you're unemployed, Carl?

41:50.520 --> 41:52.510
Don't make me be the bad guy here.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.060
- You'd never--

41:54.060 --> 41:55.570
I wouldn't?

41:55.570 --> 41:57.620
- Brett, you're my friend.

41:57.620 --> 42:00.780
- And I'm trying to help
you salvage your life, Carl.

42:02.117 --> 42:04.567
I think some gratitude
might be more appropriate.

42:05.690 --> 42:07.300
- Sociopath.

42:07.300 --> 42:09.180
That's a
compliment these days, Carl.

42:09.180 --> 42:10.430
And for that I thank you.

42:12.417 --> 42:13.990
- Don't do this, please,
please don't make me do this.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.940
- You almost did it on your own accord.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.200
I'm just giving you a little push.

42:20.200 --> 42:21.420
You can do it, Carl.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.050
Never quit on a dream.

42:26.760 --> 42:28.660
You know, I used to play the sax, too.

42:31.430 --> 42:33.680
You gotta have a lot of
soul to play the sax.

42:55.370 --> 42:56.203
Hey buddy.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.380
- Something really crazy's
going on around here.

43:00.380 --> 43:03.720
This is gonna blow your frigging mind.

43:03.720 --> 43:05.610
- What are you talking about?

43:05.610 --> 43:08.740
- I was in Kenny's room last night.

43:08.740 --> 43:09.660
- Kenny?

43:09.660 --> 43:12.240
- Yeah, Grandpa Kenny.

43:12.240 --> 43:14.010
It was in the wee hours.

43:14.010 --> 43:16.020
He asked me to come in.

43:16.020 --> 43:18.852
- Ray, you weren't supposed
to be in there last night.

43:18.852 --> 43:22.325
- Why wasn't I supposed to be in there?

43:22.325 --> 43:25.060
- So let's get you dressed,
we're going for a walk.

43:29.850 --> 43:32.480
You were drinking yesterday, smoking weed.

43:32.480 --> 43:34.210
Not to mention you just
got back from the war

43:34.210 --> 43:36.340
where they put that damn
steel plate in your head.

43:36.340 --> 43:38.450
- Okay, are you done?

43:38.450 --> 43:40.040
- I'm just saying, sometimes the mind

43:40.040 --> 43:42.050
can play tricks on us and
make us perceive things

43:42.050 --> 43:43.320
in funny ways.

43:43.320 --> 43:45.210
- Will you listen to me?

43:45.210 --> 43:47.430
My perception is fine.

43:47.430 --> 43:50.340
And what happened in that room last night

43:50.340 --> 43:52.920
was as real as anything I've experienced

43:52.920 --> 43:55.220
in my entire life.

43:55.220 --> 43:58.310
You are not gonna believe this one, Brett.

43:59.799 --> 44:02.170
- All right, what, what happened already?

44:02.170 --> 44:05.610
- We made love like animals last night.

44:06.620 --> 44:08.440
- What, who?

44:08.440 --> 44:10.270
- Me and Kenny.

44:12.093 --> 44:13.330
- Huh?

44:13.330 --> 44:15.180
- It was raw.

44:15.180 --> 44:17.100
It was wild.

44:17.100 --> 44:18.840
It was animalistic.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.223
It was everything.

44:21.223 --> 44:25.000
This is the best Christmas ever.

44:25.000 --> 44:28.540
- You banged Jen's grandfather last night?

44:28.540 --> 44:29.540
You hit that?

44:29.540 --> 44:31.590
- Oh, it wasn't like that.

44:31.590 --> 44:34.640
If anything, he was the one in control.

44:34.640 --> 44:36.620
- He's gay or bi?

44:36.620 --> 44:40.220
- He doesn't feel the need
to put labels on things.

44:40.220 --> 44:45.160
Oh man he did things to me

44:45.160 --> 44:48.300
no man's ever done before.

44:48.300 --> 44:50.720
It was a religious experience.

44:55.580 --> 44:56.413
- I like it.

44:58.520 --> 44:59.720
I like this.

45:01.750 --> 45:04.290
You're back.
- I'm back.

45:04.290 --> 45:06.440
- You are back.
- I'm back.

45:06.440 --> 45:09.757
- This shit is back.
- I'm back, I'm back!

45:09.757 --> 45:11.240
- This just in, the kid is back.

45:11.240 --> 45:15.340
- I'm back, I'm gay, I'm getting sick.

45:15.340 --> 45:17.640
- You are a sick puppy is what you are.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.350
Ray, this is legendary.

45:19.350 --> 45:21.970
You are an instant hero with the story.

45:21.970 --> 45:25.900
Now this is the greatest
story ever told, oh man.

45:25.900 --> 45:27.350
I can't wait to tell Dino and Jimmy,

45:27.350 --> 45:28.470
they're gonna shit their pants.

45:28.470 --> 45:30.658
- No, don't tell anyone, Brett.

45:30.658 --> 45:33.670
- Whoa, whoa, easy.

45:34.850 --> 45:37.640
Ray, this nothing to be ashamed of, okay?

45:37.640 --> 45:39.570
So you've been hit by a pitch.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.700
Dust yourself off, get back in the game.

45:41.700 --> 45:44.750
- I didn't get hit by a pitch.

45:44.750 --> 45:45.920
- It's a metaphor, Ray.

45:45.920 --> 45:47.820
- I understand the metaphor.

45:47.820 --> 45:50.500
And it doesn't apply here.

45:50.500 --> 45:53.600
He's an amazing man.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.650
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:55.650 --> 45:57.240
You're getting ahead
of yourself here, Ray.

45:57.240 --> 46:00.100
- We were communicating without speaking.

46:00.100 --> 46:01.810
- You were fucking high.

46:01.810 --> 46:03.390
- I understand that.

46:03.390 --> 46:05.570
And I've thought about it all morning,

46:05.570 --> 46:07.938
and it doesn't change.

46:07.938 --> 46:09.400
- Settle, Ray, okay, settle.

46:09.400 --> 46:12.302
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

46:12.302 --> 46:14.820
I'm settling with him.

46:14.820 --> 46:16.700
We're getting married.

46:16.700 --> 46:18.170
- You're what?

46:18.170 --> 46:20.120
- I love him, Brett.

46:20.120 --> 46:22.300
Get that through your head.

46:22.300 --> 46:24.180
He loves me.

46:24.180 --> 46:27.660
And we want to explore
these feelings further.

46:27.660 --> 46:28.970
Now, we're going to have

46:28.970 --> 46:31.860
a celebration wedding here tomorrow.

46:31.860 --> 46:35.030
Then Tuesday morning, we're going down

46:35.030 --> 46:37.910
to the Town Hall to make it official.

46:38.825 --> 46:42.730
I want you to be my best man.

46:45.790 --> 46:48.360
- No.
- What do you mean no?

46:49.220 --> 46:52.560
- I mean, snap the fuck out of it, Ray.

46:52.560 --> 46:54.870
You're not marrying him.

46:54.870 --> 46:59.450
Look, you've been deprived
of sex for a long time, okay?

46:59.450 --> 47:01.540
A man does crazy things
when deprived of sex.

47:01.540 --> 47:02.780
Just ask a priest.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.250
Look, you'll get past this, okay?

47:06.250 --> 47:08.370
In a few months, when you find yourself

47:08.370 --> 47:09.910
a normal piece of ass,

47:09.910 --> 47:14.137
whose birth date was sometime
after fucking Prohibition.

47:14.137 --> 47:16.687
- You're not listening to
a single word I'm saying.

47:17.710 --> 47:18.543
I love him.

47:18.543 --> 47:21.050
- No, no, you lust him.

47:21.050 --> 47:23.280
I can't believe I'm saying
this with a straight face.

47:23.280 --> 47:24.800
You lust Grandpa.

47:24.800 --> 47:27.330
You could do better than
this, Ray, much better.

47:27.330 --> 47:29.600
Give it some time, Jesus.

47:29.600 --> 47:32.320
- I don't want you at my wedding.

47:32.320 --> 47:35.040
I'll ask Carl to be my best man.

47:35.040 --> 47:36.940
- Empathize with me, Ray.

47:36.940 --> 47:39.500
42-year-old men do not
normally fall in love

47:39.500 --> 47:40.450
with the elderly.

47:40.450 --> 47:44.080
- Real love knows no boundaries, Brett.

47:45.175 --> 47:47.040
Now do you support me on this or not?

47:48.470 --> 47:49.980
Yes or no.

47:50.940 --> 47:51.820
Do you?

47:54.627 --> 47:57.810
You are as shallow as a puddle of piss.

47:58.968 --> 48:00.177
Get out of my way, Brett.

48:00.177 --> 48:01.094
- Ray. Ray.

48:05.860 --> 48:10.860
Ray!

48:23.504 --> 48:24.587
- Carl. Carl.

48:30.724 --> 48:31.557
Carl.

48:33.232 --> 48:36.020
He's a loser,
he'll only fuck it up.

48:36.020 --> 48:39.010
He's an anxious guy who's
been pushed around all day.

48:39.010 --> 48:41.950
He's a loser, loser, loser, loser, loser.

48:41.950 --> 48:45.250
- Christmas bonus is
not delivering itself.

48:47.030 --> 48:48.430
Be the hero, Carl.

48:49.450 --> 48:52.940
Be the one who makes all of
her holiday wishes come true.

48:52.940 --> 48:53.773
The hero.

49:12.500 --> 49:16.450
- Hey, sounds like the little
morning birdies are chirping,

49:16.450 --> 49:18.990
huh, the larks?

49:18.990 --> 49:20.710
Yeah, hey.

49:20.710 --> 49:21.910
- You look like hell.

49:21.910 --> 49:23.830
- Yeah, my head feels
like a demolition site.

49:23.830 --> 49:24.770
I feel like hell.

49:26.890 --> 49:30.600
- Well, maybe I can cheer you up.

49:31.532 --> 49:33.020
- Not now, Leigh.

49:34.340 --> 49:35.870
Stop.

49:35.870 --> 49:38.440
I said stop geez, do you wanna get caught?

49:38.440 --> 49:39.770
- You got bad breath.

49:39.770 --> 49:40.690
- Yeah, so do you.

49:41.635 --> 49:42.530
- What is your problem?

49:42.530 --> 49:44.570
- I think we need to put
the brakes on this, okay?

49:44.570 --> 49:45.870
- On what, us?

49:45.870 --> 49:48.660
- No, not us, I'm talking
about this project,

49:48.660 --> 49:50.436
Project Grampy.
- Why?

49:50.436 --> 49:52.860
- Because I spoke with Ray just now

49:52.860 --> 49:56.070
and he just told me some very
bizarre and perverse things.

49:56.070 --> 49:57.230
- Yeah, I know all about it.

49:57.230 --> 49:59.710
I just had a conversation
with his soulmate.

49:59.710 --> 50:01.480
He professed the whole disgusting thing.

50:01.480 --> 50:02.550
- Yeah, it's grotesque.

50:02.550 --> 50:04.750
- Yeah, it is, and potentially
a very big hindrance

50:04.750 --> 50:08.580
as he's not trying to get his
paws into my piece of the pie.

50:08.580 --> 50:11.520
So I'm confused why
exactly is there a problem?

50:11.520 --> 50:13.160
- Because he loves him, Leigh.

50:13.160 --> 50:16.380
- Jesus Christ, he
wants his fucking money.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.120
- No, I've never seen
him so sure of anything

50:18.120 --> 50:19.440
in his life, he's telling the truth.

50:19.440 --> 50:20.550
- Well, then he's a filthy creeper

50:20.550 --> 50:22.590
with a fetish for
geriatrics is what he is.

50:22.590 --> 50:24.730
- Hey, did he make a mistake, yes.

50:24.730 --> 50:25.940
But he's my brother, okay?

50:25.940 --> 50:27.550
Respect that.

50:27.550 --> 50:29.330
- No, I don't respect that.

50:29.330 --> 50:32.550
I have zero respect for perverts.

50:32.550 --> 50:34.120
So is this thing on or not,

50:34.120 --> 50:36.300
because my muscles are
getting fucking cold.

50:41.420 --> 50:44.180
What, you're gonna call it off?

50:45.940 --> 50:47.310
We had a deal.

50:49.780 --> 50:53.620
"Let's kill Grandpa this
Christmas," you said.

50:54.620 --> 50:57.290
"I will convince your drip
husband to snuff him out

50:57.290 --> 51:00.110
"so that we don't have to
do it ourselves," you said.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.000
Remember?

51:03.600 --> 51:04.950
Hello, remember?

51:10.920 --> 51:12.140
I see how it is.

51:13.160 --> 51:14.720
I see.

51:14.720 --> 51:16.530
You care more about
that perverted gimp boy

51:16.530 --> 51:17.880
that you do about us, fine.

51:19.130 --> 51:21.630
Just know that you'll never
get your hands on this

51:24.070 --> 51:24.903
again.

51:26.970 --> 51:29.830
'Cause here's now it's gonna go down now.

51:29.830 --> 51:31.700
Here's the new plan.

51:31.700 --> 51:33.700
If by tomorrow morning that old hag

51:33.700 --> 51:35.870
hasn't drifted down to
the fiery halls of hell

51:35.870 --> 51:38.180
where he belongs, we're through.

51:39.050 --> 51:42.220
And not only are we through,
but your marriage is through.

51:43.324 --> 51:44.157
- You'd never.

51:44.157 --> 51:45.180
- Oh, I will.

51:46.410 --> 51:50.260
I will tell my sister all
about her filthy husband

51:50.260 --> 51:52.910
and now he forced himself on me.

51:52.910 --> 51:55.780
And I will even turn on the tears.

51:57.290 --> 52:00.130
She will kick you out like
the unemployed vagabond

52:00.130 --> 52:01.680
that you are.

52:01.680 --> 52:04.020
- You psychopath.

52:05.140 --> 52:08.090
- That's the highest compliment
a person can receive, Brett.

52:09.000 --> 52:09.833
And for that,

52:12.000 --> 52:13.250
I thank you.

52:25.255 --> 52:27.189
- How are you doing?

52:27.189 --> 52:29.772
I'm so glad you came, you know?

52:33.507 --> 52:34.507
- Thank you.

52:36.830 --> 52:39.220
- What are you doing over there, Carl?

52:39.220 --> 52:41.260
- Oh nothing, just, uh...

52:43.150 --> 52:44.140
- What, Carl?

52:47.270 --> 52:51.100
- Leigh, I, uh...

52:55.711 --> 52:56.628
- Oh, Carl.

53:01.360 --> 53:04.350
- Do you remember how we
were when we first met, just

53:06.020 --> 53:09.190
two broke college kids
without a care in the world,

53:09.190 --> 53:13.090
just laughing, making love, smoking grass.

53:13.090 --> 53:15.640
- Yeah, of course I remember, honey.

53:16.800 --> 53:19.570
- We didn't have a nickel to spare, but,

53:19.570 --> 53:22.370
somehow we were king and queen
of the entire world, hon.

53:23.860 --> 53:27.050
- Is there something else
you wanna tell me, Carl?

53:27.050 --> 53:28.200
- No, its just,

53:30.150 --> 53:33.620
if we were, if we were to lose everything,

53:34.894 --> 53:36.320
and we had to start all over again,

53:36.320 --> 53:37.730
could you still love me?

53:39.890 --> 53:42.220
- Why are you asking me that, Carl?

53:42.220 --> 53:43.053
- I just,

53:44.020 --> 53:47.020
I just wanted to make sure
our foundation is still solid.

53:48.340 --> 53:51.030
- Well, we're not kids anymore.

53:51.030 --> 53:53.870
We're adults in the real world.

53:55.200 --> 53:56.830
And in the real world,

53:56.830 --> 53:59.730
there are winners and there are losers.

54:01.080 --> 54:04.010
I have no intention of being a loser.

54:05.020 --> 54:07.580
So if you were to lose everything,

54:07.580 --> 54:10.620
I would probably have to file for divorce.

54:14.610 --> 54:15.443
Okay.

54:16.670 --> 54:19.050
Let's get ready for Grandpa's party.

54:20.300 --> 54:22.830
I got your outfit all
picked out and ready to go.

55:07.900 --> 55:10.050
- I don't have an
appetite for some reason.

55:12.010 --> 55:15.010
- It's rude to leave the table
when people are still eating.

55:16.010 --> 55:18.000
- Everyone's done.

55:18.000 --> 55:18.833
- I'm not done.

55:18.833 --> 55:19.840
- Honey, I think that's enough

55:19.840 --> 55:21.320
with the drinking this weekend.

55:21.320 --> 55:22.153
- That's enough.

55:24.571 --> 55:25.404
Now I've got something to tell yous

55:25.404 --> 55:26.740
and I might as well do it now.

55:27.920 --> 55:29.310
I'm changing the will.

55:30.860 --> 55:32.970
Ray and I are going off to Europe

55:32.970 --> 55:34.300
and we're not coming back.

55:35.220 --> 55:36.960
I might even buy a castle.

55:36.960 --> 55:39.690
- That's a wonderful idea, Grandpa.

55:39.690 --> 55:42.240
Isn't it wonderful, Leigh?

55:42.240 --> 55:43.410
- It's amazing.

55:43.410 --> 55:46.870
- And whatever's left of the 2.2 million,

55:46.870 --> 55:49.190
after I'm gone, that's
what you get, Leigh.

55:49.190 --> 55:51.600
- Well, I don't care about that, Grandpa.

55:51.600 --> 55:53.220
I just want you to be happy.

55:53.220 --> 55:56.110
- Good, I'm going to see
the lawyer tomorrow morning,

55:56.110 --> 55:59.205
first thing, to make it official.

55:59.205 --> 56:02.660
- I think there's one
more gift under the tree.

56:02.660 --> 56:03.760
- Get the gift, Carl.

56:06.450 --> 56:08.010
Wake up, Carl.

56:09.760 --> 56:11.660
Will you wipe the dopey look off your face

56:11.660 --> 56:12.910
and get the gift?

56:27.810 --> 56:29.410
That's my gift to Jen.

56:55.860 --> 56:59.100
- Wow, what is that?

56:59.100 --> 57:02.030
- That is a Native
American fertility phallus.

57:02.030 --> 57:03.850
I made that in ceramics.

57:03.850 --> 57:05.680
It's to bring you good luck and strength

57:05.680 --> 57:07.010
to your sexual organs.

57:08.640 --> 57:10.740
- Think it'll do the trick for you, Brett?

57:11.860 --> 57:13.490
- I hope it does, Carl.

57:16.070 --> 57:18.770
- There's one more gift
in the kitchen, Carl.

57:18.770 --> 57:20.020
Get it.

57:24.492 --> 57:26.330
- Well, you better pray
with all your might,

57:26.330 --> 57:28.310
because saying no to her as a woman

57:28.310 --> 57:31.170
is like saying no to
Mother Nature herself.

57:31.170 --> 57:34.398
Taking all the fruit and
not fertilizing the land.

57:34.398 --> 57:39.398
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

57:39.562 --> 57:44.562
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

57:44.613 --> 57:49.613
♪ Happy birthday dear Grandpa ♪

57:50.546 --> 57:53.879
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

57:57.650 --> 57:59.839
♪ And many more ♪

58:03.170 --> 58:07.370
- Happy birthday to my Christmas angel.

58:07.370 --> 58:08.900
Make a wish, Grandpa.

58:08.900 --> 58:10.730
- I already had my wish.

58:10.730 --> 58:14.220
- Well, that was
yesterday, make a new wish.

58:14.220 --> 58:17.220
- Uh, well, it'd be nice
if this fucking hair

58:17.220 --> 58:18.920
would stop falling out of my head.

58:22.240 --> 58:23.910
- Well, Carl has plugs.

58:23.910 --> 58:26.585
Maybe he can point you
in the right direction.

58:26.585 --> 58:29.580
- Whoa, she is bombed.

58:29.580 --> 58:31.150
She is gonna be okay.

58:32.260 --> 58:34.300
Oh, got your wish, Jen.

58:34.300 --> 58:37.150
You're drunk, it's time to go to bed.

58:37.150 --> 58:38.960
- Get your fucking hands off me

58:38.960 --> 58:40.880
unless you wanna lose an arm.

58:40.880 --> 58:42.510
Of course I'm drunk.

58:42.510 --> 58:44.960
Any sane person would have to annihilated

58:44.960 --> 58:46.440
to hang out with this family.

58:47.570 --> 58:50.720
- Wow, your father would
be so disappointed,

58:50.720 --> 58:52.340
God rest his soul.

58:52.340 --> 58:54.350
- Blah, blah, blah.

58:54.350 --> 58:56.070
- I wish you could see yourself

58:56.070 --> 58:57.900
and what your life has turned into

58:57.900 --> 59:00.120
when you don't think things through.

59:00.120 --> 59:02.880
- You're just a perfect
example of human capability,

59:02.880 --> 59:03.880
aren't you Grandpa?

59:03.880 --> 59:06.480
- All right, party's over, Jen.

59:06.480 --> 59:07.980
- Shut up, Leigh.

59:07.980 --> 59:11.480
All you know how to do is criticize.

59:11.480 --> 59:14.920
Just criticizing everything
and everyone around you

59:14.920 --> 59:17.160
all day every fucking day.

59:19.093 --> 59:20.640
Well, I'm sick of it!

59:20.640 --> 59:23.121
'Cause all I need from
a grandfather is someone

59:23.121 --> 59:27.790
to be nice and who
leaves me the fuck alone.

59:29.660 --> 59:33.400
But look what I got, I
got a washed-up old critic

59:33.400 --> 59:35.030
with no one around in his life

59:35.030 --> 59:37.690
but people waiting for
him to croak already

59:37.690 --> 59:40.040
so they can get all his stuff.

59:40.040 --> 59:42.460
Well, I don't give a
shit about your stuff.

59:44.240 --> 59:46.490
And living in this dump
would only be a reminder

59:46.490 --> 59:49.130
of all the shit I've
had to endure from you

59:49.130 --> 59:50.970
throughout the years.

59:50.970 --> 59:54.350
Your miserable ghost haunting me,

59:54.350 --> 59:58.210
following me around from the great beyond.

59:58.210 --> 01:00:02.140
So I'm asking you, take
me off of your will.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.180
I'm begging you to do it.

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:06.930
This way I never have
to see your diabolical,

01:00:06.930 --> 01:00:11.040
heartless, wrinkly face
ever the fuck again!

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.900
- That's it!

01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.430
That's your voice!

01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:18.590
I've been waiting 20
years to hear that come

01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.170
out of your mouth.

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:22.040
Finally, an expression of the truth.

01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:26.530
If you could only do
that without the liquor.

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.170
- Well, don't be rude, Carl.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:40.200
Pull your sister-in-law out of the cake.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:00:59.280
- I don't know why she brought up my hair.

01:01:00.261 --> 01:01:01.960
- It's bedtime, Carl, time to go to bed.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:09.050
- Well, she showed her true
colors, that sister of mine.

01:01:09.050 --> 01:01:11.980
She has nothing but hate in
her heart for this family.

01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:14.980
Sorry you had to see that, Ray.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:17.310
- That's okay.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.510
And I'm gonna hit the hay now.

01:01:22.068 --> 01:01:24.985
I've got a really big day tomorrow.

01:01:26.046 --> 01:01:27.213
- You sure do.

01:02:36.460 --> 01:02:37.293
- Carl?

01:02:39.429 --> 01:02:41.510
- You scared me, asshole, what?

01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:42.343
- Are you going up there now?

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:44.630
- Where do you think I'm going, huh?

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:46.270
Outside to make a snowman?

01:02:46.270 --> 01:02:47.620
- Carl, this is bad.

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.320
This is really bad.

01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:52.200
- Oh, you think so?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.710
- I just wanted to be a writer.

01:02:57.550 --> 01:02:59.150
Living out here would have been,

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.860
but Ray, Ray.

01:03:06.568 --> 01:03:08.690
I just wanted him to be happy.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.190
That's all I ever wanted.

01:03:15.827 --> 01:03:20.827
It's all I ever wanted.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.930
- We should end it now.

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.130
Pretend like none of this ever happened.

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:40.770
Get the Christmas spirit back.

01:03:48.569 --> 01:03:52.990
- Carl, Carl, Carl.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.324
This breaks my heart, Carl,

01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:58.788
you're such a nice guy.

01:03:58.788 --> 01:04:03.590
It breaks my heart, Carl,
you're such a nice guy.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:06.833
- Okay.

01:04:08.772 --> 01:04:09.605
- Carl?

01:04:16.336 --> 01:04:18.003
Where are you going?

01:04:19.062 --> 01:04:21.110
- I'm going in there.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.630
What?

01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:24.420
- What, are you fucking deaf?

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.720
I said I'm going in there.

01:04:38.685 --> 01:04:41.910
I'm going in there, get this
fucking shit over with already.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:10.120
- Morning, Ray.
- Good morning, Leigh.

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:11.920
- You look great.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.850
Have you seen your groom yet this morning?

01:05:13.850 --> 01:05:15.650
- Of course not.

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:18.688
It's bad luck to see the
groom before the ceremony.

01:05:18.688 --> 01:05:22.100
Everybody knows that.

01:05:23.138 --> 01:05:24.138
- Of course.

01:05:24.990 --> 01:05:27.090
Have you seen him yet this morning, Brett?

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:32.100
You know, he really should be up by now.

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.450
Grandpa?

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:35.280
- Oh, I'm sure he's up.

01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:39.900
I bet your groom looks amazing, Ray.

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:43.740
- Look who's suddenly on Team Grandpa.

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.840
Isn't that interesting?

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.480
Grandpa, you're gonna be
late for your own wedding!

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.310
- He's up, I'm sure.

01:05:52.310 --> 01:05:55.020
He's probably just playing
with his hair or something.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:57.590
- You're sure in a better mood today

01:05:57.590 --> 01:05:59.140
than yesterday, Jen.

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.210
- Today, I see with new eyes, Ray.

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:04.090
Bloodshot, but new.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:04.923
- Grandpa?

01:06:05.770 --> 01:06:07.780
- You know, after all you've been through,

01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:10.060
nobody deserves to be
blessed with a soulmate

01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.110
any more than you do.

01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:14.820
- I just wish we could've
gotten Grandpa a new tux.

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.760
- You know, I think we've all had it

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:19.490
with the loving
granddaughter routine, Leigh.

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:22.520
It's getting to be a bit
nauseating now, don't you think?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:26.746
- You know, you may have
managed to ruin Christmas,

01:06:26.746 --> 01:06:29.350
but I'm not going to stand here

01:06:29.350 --> 01:06:32.130
and let you destroy Grandpa's wedding.

01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:34.240
- I bumped into Carl last night

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.520
on my way to pouring myself a drink.

01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:39.620
Had to sting out of the
nightmare called my life.

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.320
When I noticed Carl over there clutching

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.500
onto a big white fluffy pillow,

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:47.000
quivering like a frightened little puppy.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.530
"What you doing over
there, Carl," I asked.

01:06:49.530 --> 01:06:51.810
Poor thing, he was too scared to speak.

01:06:51.810 --> 01:06:54.310
So I thought, Carl looks
like he can use himself

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:55.560
a drink, too.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.490
So I went and I poured
us a couple of brandies

01:06:57.490 --> 01:06:58.590
and we got to talking.

01:06:59.441 --> 01:07:01.510
And do you know what he told me, Leigh?

01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:04.627
He told me he'd just
gotten through storming

01:07:04.627 --> 01:07:09.627
into Grandpa's room with
that big white fluffy pillow.

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:53.991
- You son of a bitch, you son of a bitch.

01:07:53.991 --> 01:07:56.408
You live, you son of a bitch.

01:08:08.314 --> 01:08:09.147
- Carl!

01:08:12.154 --> 01:08:14.070
Get your ass out here now!

01:08:21.830 --> 01:08:26.630
How dare you attempt to
do such a wicked thing.

01:08:26.630 --> 01:08:29.359
- That's exactly what I asked, Leigh.

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.399
And do you know what he told me?

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:35.635
He told me, "Brett made me do it."

01:08:35.635 --> 01:08:36.880
- Is that true, Brett?

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.250
- Of course not, Ray.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:40.500
That's ridiculous, honey.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.550
- Shut up, Brett.

01:08:42.490 --> 01:08:45.640
Why would Brett make Carl
do such a wicked thing?

01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:47.640
I wanted to know.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.310
And that's when Carl mentioned
the hair plug comment

01:08:50.310 --> 01:08:52.240
I'd made earlier in the evening.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.189
A comment which he said
was completely untrue.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:58.029
Funny, I thought.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:01.510
Why would my sister make
up such a crazy story

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:03.470
about her husband's hair,

01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:07.850
while I was lamenting to her
about my husband's infidelity?

01:09:07.850 --> 01:09:10.970
- Get your fingers out
of my husband's hair.

01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:27.450
- Tell me something, Thomas,

01:09:27.450 --> 01:09:29.420
when you're screwing my husband,

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:32.740
and his teeny-weeny little peeny pops out,

01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:36.180
as it tends to, can you even feel it?

01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:40.410
Oh hey, Grandpa, still alive, huh?

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.870
- Yeah, thanks to Carl I am.

01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:46.479
- Hi Grandpa, what are
you doing with the gun?

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:47.750
- Oh, I like to carry it.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.960
You know, they said I can still carry it.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.800
Not that I listen to their rules.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.899
I have my own rules.

01:09:52.899 --> 01:09:55.790
- Uh, I think you should
put that down for now.

01:09:55.790 --> 01:09:58.380
It's starting to frighten us a little bit.

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:00.040
- But I really like holding it.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.880
You know, it's sort of
like a comfort blanket.

01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:03.590
You remember those little comfort blankets

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:06.090
you girls had when you were young?

01:10:06.090 --> 01:10:08.710
Yeah, made you feel nice and safe?

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:10.440
- Yeah, I remember.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.480
- What did yours look like, Leigh?

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.130
- Well, it was blue, with
little pink bunnies on it.

01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:18.620
- Right, see I like to think of this

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:20.660
as my little blue blanket

01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.790
with little pink bunnies on it,

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:26.890
just in case the big bad wolf
comes knocking on that door

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.589
in the middle of the night.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:33.830
- Grandpa.

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:36.510
- I want you two to move
over to that wall over there.

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:37.830
Come on, move it!

01:10:38.972 --> 01:10:39.805
Move!

01:10:40.890 --> 01:10:43.411
Now get down on your knees,
get down on your knees.

01:10:43.411 --> 01:10:44.244
Do it!

01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:47.630
- Well, what about Carl?

01:10:50.823 --> 01:10:53.650
- Are you sorry, sonny,
for trying to kill me?

01:10:53.650 --> 01:10:56.280
- Words could never express it Kenny.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.190
I was weak.

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.970
- Uh, relax, everybody makes a mistake.

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.540
But at the end, you were strong.

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:07.162
- Thank you.

01:11:07.162 --> 01:11:09.260
Thank you, Kenny.

01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:10.840
- I'm calling the police.

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.880
No, no, no, that's not
gonna do us any good.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.930
You can't get any justice
here, just ask OJ.

01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:18.710
What do you think, Leigh,

01:11:18.710 --> 01:11:20.050
should I put you out of your misery

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:22.250
like you were thinking about
putting me out of mine?

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:23.770
- It was his idea.

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.610
The whole thing, it was all his idea.

01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:28.567
- Is that true, Brett?

01:11:28.567 --> 01:11:30.567
Were you thinking of putting
me down like an old horse

01:11:30.567 --> 01:11:32.030
so you could get my house?

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:33.930
- Come on, you've known her long enough

01:11:33.930 --> 01:11:34.763
to know how she is.

01:11:34.763 --> 01:11:36.976
She lies, she's a liar.

01:11:36.976 --> 01:11:38.870
She's a pathological liar.

01:11:38.870 --> 01:11:39.820
- And what are you?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.700
- Aw honey, come on, I can
make it up to you, please.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.260
- Oh honey, honey.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.230
You better hope he kills you,

01:11:47.230 --> 01:11:48.960
because you no longer have a sponsor.

01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.380
- Or a brother.

01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:53.730
- Ray, come on, she made me do it, Ray.

01:11:53.730 --> 01:11:56.464
- I feel sorry for you, Brett.

01:11:56.464 --> 01:11:58.460
I really do.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:00.554
- You have any last words, either of you?

01:12:00.554 --> 01:12:03.203
- Please, please, please,
please, please, please,

01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:04.600
please, please.
- Have you been doing that

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.890
all of your life?

01:12:05.890 --> 01:12:08.540
Please, please, please,
don't hurt me, please.

01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:10.140
Say it.

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:12.150
All right, let's get on with this.

01:12:12.150 --> 01:12:12.983
Who's with me.

01:12:16.570 --> 01:12:19.860
Don't you move an inch or
I'll blast that stupid look

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:20.880
off your face.

01:12:23.803 --> 01:12:24.636
Do you have the vows, honey?

01:12:24.636 --> 01:12:27.220
- Yeah, I hope they're not too long.

01:12:27.220 --> 01:12:29.110
I don't like drawing out ceremonies.

01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:32.290
- No honey, they're just
like you, short and sweet.

01:12:34.419 --> 01:12:36.830
- Here Carl, you're the priest.

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:37.663
- Okay.

01:12:39.710 --> 01:12:41.560
- Any objections, Leigh?

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.960
Huh, anything you wanna say?

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:46.170
Any objections to us getting married?

01:12:46.170 --> 01:12:47.520
- Congratulations!

01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:50.400
- Thank you, Brett,
that means a lot to me.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.490
And I'm gonna keep that in mind

01:12:52.490 --> 01:12:54.390
when I decide where to fucking bury you.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.810
- What are you gonna do?
- What?

01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:00.016
- Whatever you're gonna do, just do it.

01:13:00.016 --> 01:13:03.320
- Now isn't that just like
you, always about to you.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.020
You wanna talk about you all the time.

01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:07.220
I'm trying to get married here.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:09.040
And you want to talk about you.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.340
Okay, okay, let's make it about you, huh?

01:13:12.304 --> 01:13:14.704
Tell them how the story's gonna end.

01:13:45.898 --> 01:13:46.898
- How grave.

01:13:48.893 --> 01:13:51.082
What about you, Leigh,
what are you gonna do?

01:13:51.082 --> 01:13:53.670
- Just shoot me.

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.720
Just shoot me and get it over with.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:59.870
- Aw, get the fuck out of
here before I change my mind.

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:07.250
- Carl?
- What?

01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:08.510
- I need the keys.

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.480
- Walk.

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:38.781
All right,
let's get on with this.

01:14:38.781 --> 01:14:39.614
Go ahead, Carl.

01:14:39.614 --> 01:14:41.142
Okay, just read it?

01:14:41.142 --> 01:14:42.130
- You can read, right?

01:14:42.130 --> 01:14:43.470
- Yeah, I can read.

01:14:56.970 --> 01:14:59.190
Do you Ray take this ancient relic

01:14:59.190 --> 01:15:01.490
till the day he croaks to be your husband?

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:07.180
To enjoy him deeply and not
take things too seriously?

01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:11.100
To live your truth despite
what he or the government

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:15.000
or the Illuminati or the aliens are doing?

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.830
Do you promise to be happy for yourself

01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:19.180
so you can inspire happiness in him

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.150
or anyone else who cares to be,

01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:23.824
though not make it your responsibility?

01:15:23.824 --> 01:15:27.070
I do.

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:31.050
- And do you, Kenny, take
this paralyzed immobile lump

01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.040
to be your husband?

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.470
To wheel him around and let
him be just one more excuse

01:15:36.470 --> 01:15:39.970
for your happiness on this
perfectly fucked up planet,

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:42.410
till the forces within or without

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:45.180
pull the two of you irrevokably apart,

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:47.440
despite the fact that
on a subatomic level,

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:50.100
you never were and never will be separate?

01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:51.560
- I do.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.010
- You may now kiss the groom.
