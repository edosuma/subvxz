WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:05.744
I'm looking for
someone named Willem Arondeus.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.137
He might be able to help me.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.009
Who are you?
What good are you to me?

00:09.009 --> 00:11.054
If I help you, how are you
going to be able to help me?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.403
Something's changed.

00:12.403 --> 00:14.188
You're distant and,
and you always have to go?

00:14.188 --> 00:16.407
Nothing's changed.
No, you're lying.

00:16.407 --> 00:18.105
And we don't lie to
each other, remember?

00:18.105 --> 00:19.454
Why did you go to church?

00:19.454 --> 00:21.064
What else are you lying about?

00:21.064 --> 00:22.587
I'm doing
what you are doing.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.024
You said yes to Mr. Frank.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.983
I said yes too.
I can't tell you more than that.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.767
We're not doing enough.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.118
When you feel
like that, there's only
one thing you can do.

00:31.509 --> 00:34.121
We're gonna start a fire.

01:12.159 --> 01:17.468
<i>♪ When you're smilin',
when you're smilin' ♪</i>

01:17.468 --> 01:22.647
<i>♪ The whole world
smiles with you ♪</i>

01:22.647 --> 01:28.436
<i>♪ When you're laughin',
when you're laughin' ♪</i>

01:28.436 --> 01:33.658
<i>♪ The sun comes
shining through ♪</i>

01:33.658 --> 01:39.360
<i>♪ But when you're cryin',
you bring on the rain ♪</i>

01:39.360 --> 01:42.102
<i>♪ So, stop your sighin'</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:44.408
<i>♪ Be happy again ♪</i>

01:44.408 --> 01:47.629
It was a perfect day.

01:48.717 --> 01:50.719
You looked so beautiful.

01:50.719 --> 01:52.808
I mean, you got so excited,

01:52.808 --> 01:54.940
you forgot to say, "I do."

01:54.940 --> 01:59.771
Oh, sorry.
Um, I do, I do. Do you?

01:59.771 --> 02:02.426
I do.

02:13.742 --> 02:15.787
You remember my
wedding better than I do.

02:15.787 --> 02:19.226
I mean, it was the most
romantic thing I had ever seen.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.097
You remember it
very differently, too.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.099
I just found it
really stressful.

02:23.099 --> 02:25.449
How was it not the
most romantic day of your life?

02:25.449 --> 02:27.451
We got married
in a government building.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.018
Yeah.

02:29.018 --> 02:31.934
I mean, you looked so beautiful
and Jan looked so handsome.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.850
I mean, I did, I did
wonder if I'd ever be

02:34.850 --> 02:36.982
as in love as you two were.

02:36.982 --> 02:39.420
Why are you being
so sappy all of a sudden?

02:39.420 --> 02:41.596
What have you done with my Anne?

02:44.338 --> 02:47.384
Miep.
Yeah?

02:47.384 --> 02:50.996
Okay.
Can you keep a secret?

02:50.996 --> 02:53.956
Uh, Anne,
look where we are.

02:53.956 --> 02:58.134
Okay, um, so.
So?

02:58.134 --> 03:01.355
Yesterday, uh,
during the air raid.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.139
Mm-hmm.

03:03.139 --> 03:06.316
Peter came up and
he asked if I was okay.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.970
I mean, I was, Pim was here.

03:07.970 --> 03:14.237
But, you know, Peter,
he was, he was so nice.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.196
What?
You, you have a crush on Peter?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.936
No, I mean,
no, no, no, no, no.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.677
We just talked.

03:19.677 --> 03:20.983
Mm-hmm.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.593
He teaches me some
things about myself and,

03:22.593 --> 03:24.378
I mean, I do the same to him.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.381
Well, he's just very nice.

03:29.121 --> 03:32.734
You have a crush on Peter.
Stop it.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.693
This thing between
Anne and Peter won't do.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.522
It's harmless, isn't it?

03:38.522 --> 03:40.002
I mean, when I
was that age it was.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.438
Yes.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.048
But you didn't live in a
tiny warren of rooms with

03:43.048 --> 03:45.355
seven other people,
including that boy's parents.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.748
Mm-hmm.

03:46.748 --> 03:47.879
I don't have to
tell you all the ways this

03:47.879 --> 03:50.360
could go horribly wrong.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.407
All these feelings will have
to wait until after the war.

03:53.407 --> 03:56.192
I don't know if
you can just stop them.

03:56.192 --> 04:00.327
No, no,
I'm not sure I can.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.678
I need you to, to
discourage Anne from

04:03.678 --> 04:06.028
continuing with
the van Pels boy.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.291
Mrs. Frank, it's...
Please, Miep.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.032
You've been keeping
us wonderfully safe

04:10.032 --> 04:11.425
throughout all this.

04:11.425 --> 04:15.864
This situation
doesn't feel safe.

04:17.692 --> 04:21.739
We Dutch, we keep
very meticulous records and

04:21.739 --> 04:25.352
so we've basically provided the
Nazis with a detailed register

04:25.352 --> 04:28.920
of who and where our
Jewish citizens are.

04:28.920 --> 04:33.447
So, what's the solution?
How do we counter that?

04:33.969 --> 04:37.189
We blow up the
Civil Registry Office

04:37.189 --> 04:40.323
and every record inside.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.891
Our friend Jan has
already taken a huge risk.

04:42.891 --> 04:45.110
He's used his access as
a social worker to explore

04:45.110 --> 04:46.329
the layout of the building.

04:46.329 --> 04:47.765
Thank you, Jan.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.854
I knew the place a bit.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.988
We're blowing up the
building I got married in.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.946
It's very romantic, Jan.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
Thank you for that.

04:56.948 --> 05:01.301
So, using Jan's intel,
I've made a map of the building,

05:01.301 --> 05:04.129
and where the greatest
numbers of records are kept.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.131
Oh, hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

05:06.131 --> 05:07.742
Okay.

05:07.742 --> 05:10.135
With an action this big, there
will be reprisals and the Nazis,

05:10.135 --> 05:12.399
they will hit back.

05:12.399 --> 05:14.792
For those of you
that participate in this,

05:14.792 --> 05:18.274
you may be hunted
and you may be killed.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.931
I'm saying that there
is no shame if any of you

05:22.931 --> 05:26.326
want to back out now.

05:28.458 --> 05:29.764
Okay.

05:29.764 --> 05:31.809
We'll come and have a look then.

05:31.809 --> 05:32.984
Right.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.986
So what we see is
the courtyard here.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.162
There's pictures of everything.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.816
Thank you,
thank you for your help.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.341
You're welcome.
We're just getting started.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.646
No, no.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.214
You're, you're too
valuable for this one, okay?

05:46.868 --> 05:49.566
I want to do
as much as I can.

05:49.566 --> 05:53.265
Look, you've already
done what no one else can.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.963
Your access has,
has made it possible.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.443
It's more than enough.

05:56.443 --> 05:59.010
Thank you.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.319
So, let's
see the first floor,

06:03.319 --> 06:05.452
Willem did you have...

06:25.210 --> 06:27.561
Hey Cas, morning.

06:32.217 --> 06:33.958
I saw Cas today.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.918
Oh, yeah? How's he doing?

06:36.918 --> 06:40.400
I don't know.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.967
I hid from him.

06:42.967 --> 06:46.841
I mean, the last time
we spoke wasn't great and

06:46.841 --> 06:48.538
I've stopped seeing my family.

06:48.538 --> 06:52.499
It's much easier to lie to them
if I just don't see them at all.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.373
A bit like you really.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.896
What's that
supposed to mean?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.420
Hmm.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.858
Well, since you've started
working with the resistance,

07:03.858 --> 07:06.077
you leave in
the morning, come home.

07:06.077 --> 07:08.602
I don't know anything
you've done in the day.

07:10.560 --> 07:12.214
Yeah?

07:12.214 --> 07:14.085
I'm sorry, Jan, um,

07:14.085 --> 07:16.392
what time do we have to
be at the train station?

07:16.392 --> 07:19.090
Uh, train for
Hilversum leaves at 5:30.

07:19.090 --> 07:21.571
And we really can't be late.

07:21.571 --> 07:24.574
The lady who's agreed to hide
you is getting a little antsy.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.447
Mm-hmm.
Well, I might not sleep at all.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.926
This is all so sudden.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.102
Are you sure this is necessary?

07:31.102 --> 07:33.453
I know it's
nerve-racking, but it,

07:33.453 --> 07:34.889
it is the best thing to do.

07:34.889 --> 07:37.195
Even Max says it's time
to get out of Amsterdam.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.588
It's just not safe here.

07:38.588 --> 07:42.592
Yes, yes.

07:42.592 --> 07:45.856
Well, um, see
you in the morning.

07:45.856 --> 07:48.772
Night, night.
Um, night.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.091
What were
we talking about?

08:03.091 --> 08:06.877
Oh, yeah, that we never
talk about anything anymore.

08:07.791 --> 08:12.492
After the war's over, I'll
tell you everything, I promise.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.322
I saw this
great pair of shoes today.

08:17.322 --> 08:19.150
Remember those ones
that I used to have?

08:19.150 --> 08:21.109
The red ones
with a little strap?

08:21.109 --> 08:23.111
Mm-mm.
What?

08:23.111 --> 08:24.286
How can you not remember them?

08:24.286 --> 08:26.114
I wore them on our first date.

08:26.114 --> 08:31.293
Mm-hmm.
Oh. Get this as well.

08:31.293 --> 08:34.818
Anne has a crush on Peter,

08:34.818 --> 08:37.168
and Mrs. Frank asked
me to put a stop to it.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.387
But how can I?

08:38.387 --> 08:40.694
How can I break her
little heart like that?

08:40.694 --> 08:42.391
Anne thinks that we
got married in a rush,

08:42.391 --> 08:47.091
because we were so in love,
we couldn't wait.

08:50.878 --> 08:54.011
I can't believe you
don't remember those shoes.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.021
Hello. You found us.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.546
Yeah. Thank you.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.809
You'll
stay in my daughter's old room.

09:08.809 --> 09:10.201
It's a small bed,
but a down duvet.

09:10.201 --> 09:11.376
It
will be lovely, I'm sure.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.509
Thank you so much for this.

09:13.509 --> 09:16.164
It's so stressful in Amsterdam,

09:16.164 --> 09:18.819
the razzias seem to
getting closer and closer.

09:18.819 --> 09:21.561
We all
have to do what we can.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.475
It works out
rather well this time.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.913
Okay. This is going well.
Mm-hmm.

09:25.913 --> 09:27.958
Maybe we can get
the early train back.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.221
Why are you
so antsy to leave?

09:30.221 --> 09:32.006
I thought we could
have a walk by the pond.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.224
It's so pretty here.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.444
Uh, no, I have to get back.

09:35.444 --> 09:39.579
For what?
Can you just tell me?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.059
This is what I
was talking about.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.193
Do you want me
to make something up?

09:45.193 --> 09:46.977
No, just trust me.

09:46.977 --> 09:49.023
And what is it? Stealing IDs?

09:49.023 --> 09:50.546
Delivering money?

09:50.546 --> 09:52.548
Are you hiding another family?

09:52.548 --> 09:54.376
I don't wanna wait
until after the war.

09:54.376 --> 09:57.031
I want my husband back.

10:05.126 --> 10:08.042
I'm right here.

10:08.042 --> 10:12.220
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

10:12.220 --> 10:14.788
Mm-hmm. Hmm.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.923
Is it bad that I'm really
excited that Mrs. Stoppelman is

10:19.923 --> 10:24.449
moving to the country, have the
whole apartment to ourselves.

10:24.449 --> 10:27.714
I warn you, I might
never wear a bra ever again.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.150
I support this plan.

10:29.150 --> 10:32.109
I might not
wear any clothes at all.

10:33.763 --> 10:35.591
Hey, you're here.

10:35.591 --> 10:36.940
I'm Kuno.

10:36.940 --> 10:39.073
Oh. Hi, Kuno. Jan.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.857
Ah, yes. Miep.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.946
Miep. Yeah.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.774
Oh, thank you so
much for, for doing this.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.471
Oh, no, not at all.

10:46.471 --> 10:47.951
Thank you.
Thank, thank your mother.

10:47.951 --> 10:50.301
No, it
worked out really well.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.955
Yeah. Uh.
But what.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.740
It does.
Does exactly?

10:53.740 --> 10:56.133
I have a
girlfriend in Amsterdam,

10:56.133 --> 10:58.135
so that'll be great.

10:58.135 --> 11:01.312
So when are we leaving?

11:01.312 --> 11:03.314
Uh, Kuno, uh, sweetheart,

11:03.314 --> 11:06.666
I haven't talked to
them yet about this part.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.494
Kuno's at University here,
and he's got himself into

11:09.494 --> 11:11.975
a little bit of trouble
with a local Nazi party.

11:11.975 --> 11:13.281
Well, I wouldn't
sign their loyalty pledge.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.412
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.023
Kuno, shh, shh.

11:16.023 --> 11:19.113
And so I thought, well, since
Kuno is wanted in Hilversum,

11:19.113 --> 11:20.723
and Mrs. Stoppelman
can't be in Amsterdam,

11:20.723 --> 11:22.899
because she's Jewish, well,
why not make a trade?

11:22.899 --> 11:25.162
It seemed only fair.

11:25.162 --> 11:28.209
And I know you have the room.

11:29.297 --> 11:32.039
Sounds great.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.825
I don't know if
Peter even cares about me.

11:35.825 --> 11:38.001
He's spending so
much time with Margot.

11:38.001 --> 11:40.874
Well, to be fair,
his options are limited.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.267
I mean, she's
always going up there.

11:43.267 --> 11:48.490
Maybe, maybe that's
just how it's meant to be,

11:48.490 --> 11:51.145
you know, maybe
Margot is more his type.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.494
Well, Margot?

11:52.494 --> 11:54.191
For goodness sake, Anne,

11:54.191 --> 11:56.498
I'm only helping
him with his maths.

11:56.498 --> 11:58.152
Stop listening in.

11:58.152 --> 12:00.720
Well, I, I can't
help it, you're so loud.

12:00.720 --> 12:05.899
Besides, I, I don't
think of Peter in that way.

12:08.597 --> 12:12.688
Listen, if you want to
pursue something with him,

12:12.688 --> 12:14.690
I, I think you should.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.040
Maybe neither of you
should be thinking about him.

12:17.040 --> 12:20.043
I just wish he
would give me a sign.

12:20.043 --> 12:22.350
How did you know Jan loved you?

12:22.350 --> 12:24.221
Better yet,
how did he propose?

12:24.221 --> 12:26.876
Yeah, how did he propose?
Tell us everything.

12:26.876 --> 12:28.704
Okay. Well, firstly,
there was a lot of shit.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.706
Miep.
Oh, my God.

12:30.706 --> 12:33.317
Okay, let me go back.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.276
And so after the occupation,

12:35.276 --> 12:37.582
the Nazis were trying to
get rid of undesirables.

12:37.582 --> 12:39.236
Besides Jews?
Yeah, yeah.

12:39.236 --> 12:42.326
And I became an undesirable,
because I was an immigrant here.

12:42.326 --> 12:44.415
So the Nazis called me
into the government offices

12:44.415 --> 12:46.243
and revoked my passport.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.637
They told me I had three
months to leave the country.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.987
I was scared to death.

12:50.987 --> 12:53.555
Your father actually
caught me crying at my desk

12:53.555 --> 12:57.037
and forced me to tell
him what was wrong.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.474
I have a good job,
I have a good man.

12:59.474 --> 13:02.564
You know, this is my
home and I don't wanna leave.

13:02.564 --> 13:05.436
Well, you can't.
I need you here.

13:05.436 --> 13:09.658
Besides Anne would never
forgive me if I let you go.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.794
Marry him.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.230
What?

13:16.230 --> 13:18.319
You said yourself
you have a good man.

13:18.319 --> 13:22.149
Marry the Dutchman.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.456
Jan at the
time was working about

13:25.456 --> 13:27.850
an hour south of
Amsterdam for a week.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.461
He was helping his friend on
their farm with the harvest by

13:30.461 --> 13:34.814
shoveling manure to
fertilize the fields.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.209
Have you finalized your divorce?

13:39.209 --> 13:41.342
Because we need
to get married like,

13:41.342 --> 13:44.127
like yesterday or I'm gonna
be kicked out of the country.

13:44.127 --> 13:49.306
So if you, if you love me,

13:49.306 --> 13:52.570
let's do this, and fast.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.444
Oh no, wait.

13:56.444 --> 13:57.662
Ah, did I get this all wrong?

13:57.662 --> 13:59.142
No, no, no, no, it's...

13:59.142 --> 14:00.317
Wait, do
you not want this?

14:00.317 --> 14:01.362
No.
Wait. You...

14:01.362 --> 14:02.493
No, it's not,
it's not that.

14:02.493 --> 14:03.625
You have a
funny way of showing it.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.844
No, it's just...

14:04.844 --> 14:06.062
"Someday
we'll go to Paris, Miep."

14:06.062 --> 14:07.150
But you talking about
having kids, what?

14:07.150 --> 14:08.586
No, I...
Kids?

14:08.586 --> 14:09.849
Have you been stringing
me along this whole time?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.633
Was this all some big con?

14:11.633 --> 14:13.113
Because I can do
much better than you pal.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.462
Stop it. Stop.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.377
I've already divorced her.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.900
It's done.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.556
What?
Yes. I did it a month ago.

14:21.556 --> 14:23.427
I was gonna tell you
once I bought the ring

14:23.427 --> 14:24.951
I've been saving for.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.213
Oh.

14:26.213 --> 14:28.171
And then I was
gonna ask your father.

14:28.171 --> 14:29.303
Why?

14:29.303 --> 14:30.826
Then I was
gonna find somewhere to

14:30.826 --> 14:33.437
propose to you Miep, like,
like in front of the bar where

14:33.437 --> 14:37.485
we first met or on
the bridge where we had
our first kiss, anywhere,

14:37.485 --> 14:40.401
anywhere on God's
green Earth except

14:40.401 --> 14:44.405
the middle of this shit field.

14:45.754 --> 14:48.888
And if you think you
can do better than me,

14:48.888 --> 14:50.977
then maybe you should.

14:50.977 --> 14:54.197
No, no, wait, wait.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:54.197 --> 14:55.677
Wait, wait.

14:55.677 --> 14:58.332
I, I do want you to propose me.

14:58.332 --> 14:59.899
Propose to me.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.335
No.
What?

15:01.335 --> 15:04.773
Not now, then later,
whenever and however you want.

15:04.773 --> 15:08.211
But you can't do it if
I'm on a train to Vienna.

15:08.211 --> 15:13.086
Oh, God.
So, so.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.391
What are you doing?
Jan.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.566
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

15:15.566 --> 15:17.351
Oh God.

15:19.570 --> 15:22.573
Firstly, I can
do much better than you.

15:22.573 --> 15:26.882
And secondly, will you make me
the happiest girl in the world

15:26.882 --> 15:32.409
by marrying me so I can stay
in the country with you, please?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.846
Yes.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.718
No, no, don't do this.

15:36.718 --> 15:38.459
Come on. No.

15:44.595 --> 15:46.946
You proposed to him?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.339
Oh, you and
Jan proved that two
people can fall in love.

15:49.339 --> 15:52.212
I mean, even in the most
unacceptable circumstance.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.909
It's, well, it wasn't
quite as romantic as that.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.345
Yes, it is.

15:55.345 --> 15:59.436
I mean, it seems inspiring
and amazing and perfect.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.178
Seriously.

16:14.321 --> 16:16.758
Oh, oh, God. Uh.

16:16.758 --> 16:18.629
Oh, my God.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:18.629 --> 16:21.110
Oh, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.459
Sorry.

16:22.459 --> 16:25.767
Oh, uh, uh...

16:25.767 --> 16:27.116
Hey, Jan!

16:27.116 --> 16:29.989
Hey Kuno.

16:31.468 --> 16:32.904
I thought I was in
the wrong apartment!

16:32.904 --> 16:35.516
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to die.

16:35.516 --> 16:36.778
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:36.778 --> 16:38.301
I did tell Kuno that
since he can't go out,

16:38.301 --> 16:40.129
he can bring Hendrika over here.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.001
Okay. Well,
next time I'll knock.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.481
In your
own apartment? Why?

16:44.481 --> 16:47.049
Well, I wonder why?
What do you think?

16:47.049 --> 16:49.443
Uh, this was delicious. Really.

16:49.443 --> 16:50.487
Yes, thank you.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.098
Where are you going?

16:52.098 --> 16:54.143
Uh, I have got some work,
things to be getting on with.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.058
What kind
of work do you do?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.277
Yeah, Jan.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.061
Yeah, tell us on what
kind of work do you do?

16:59.061 --> 17:00.715
Not much to tell.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.847
No. No, he
doesn't tell me anything.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.458
All I know that
it's very dangerous.

17:04.458 --> 17:05.589
Every time he leaves the house,

17:05.589 --> 17:07.156
I'm worried I'll
never see him again.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.505
Come on, what is it?

17:08.505 --> 17:10.159
He really
doesn't tell you?

17:10.159 --> 17:12.074
No, he hasn't for months
now, but I've tried to guess.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.641
I think I put two
and two together.

17:13.641 --> 17:18.515
I think, I think he works, um,
for the circus, you know,

17:18.515 --> 17:21.562
tightrope walker
or maybe a clown.

17:21.562 --> 17:23.694
No.

17:23.694 --> 17:25.348
I thought you
were a social worker.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.872
I am a social worker.
Don't listen to this lady.

17:27.872 --> 17:30.658
It's all very boring
stuff believe you me.

17:30.658 --> 17:33.878
Very boring.
See you later.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.243
Professor.

17:50.243 --> 17:53.115
Mr. Broers.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.509
Hello, Jan.

17:55.509 --> 17:58.990
You look well, you staying safe?

18:00.296 --> 18:02.690
You still want to argue with
me that Nietzsche had it wrong?

18:02.690 --> 18:05.084
Quiet.
What is this?

18:05.084 --> 18:07.086
Jan.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.131
These men saw
fit to drop their trash

18:09.131 --> 18:12.134
in the streets, like pigs.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.093
I dropped a candy wrapper.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.747
I picked it up.

18:16.747 --> 18:21.230
Keep on working.
I have no more spit.

18:23.058 --> 18:25.104
Use this, Jew.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.931
Hey, hey, hey.
Jan, Jan!

18:26.931 --> 18:31.719
Keep walking, son. It's okay.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.990
Keep cleaning.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.130
I need to be a
part of the operation.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.522
The Records Office.

18:52.522 --> 18:53.480
No, I've
already told you.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.351
No, no, no, no, no.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.614
I understand I'm
valuable in my position.

18:57.614 --> 18:59.790
Okay. I get it.

18:59.790 --> 19:02.053
But it's not enough.

19:02.053 --> 19:05.274
People could be giving up
their lives for this and

19:05.274 --> 19:07.146
I get a free pass
because of my job?

19:07.146 --> 19:11.106
No. I will not
stand by anymore.

19:13.021 --> 19:16.633
Jan, I don't doubt
for a second that you'd be

19:16.633 --> 19:19.984
willing to give your
life for this cause.

19:19.984 --> 19:23.423
But this action, this
action requires people

19:23.423 --> 19:27.470
who are willing to
take a life for it and

19:27.470 --> 19:31.170
I just don't think
you've got it in you.

19:31.431 --> 19:36.305
It's not a bad thing,
it's just, but it's not you.

19:38.525 --> 19:42.224
"There is a
certain right by which we
may deprive a man of life."

19:44.226 --> 19:47.534
What's
that supposed to mean?

19:47.882 --> 19:52.321
It's Nietzsche.
It means, "Try me."

19:59.633 --> 20:01.852
Okay.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.209
I will.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.168
There is a certain
Nazi Officer who

20:13.168 --> 20:16.824
makes the schedules
of the razzias in town.

20:16.824 --> 20:20.088
He alone decides
which neighborhoods
are raided and when.

20:21.611 --> 20:25.224
Each week, this prick visits the
same prostitute at the same time

20:25.224 --> 20:27.530
in a hotel on the Warmoestraat.

20:27.530 --> 20:30.229
Like clockwork.

20:50.814 --> 20:55.341
If you can't do it,
just walk away.

20:57.212 --> 21:01.608
It's fine. It's good, in fact.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.530
What?

21:20.714 --> 21:24.718
Oh! Ohh!

21:25.284 --> 21:26.589
What the hell is going on?

21:26.589 --> 21:29.636
He did it!
The son of a bitch killed me!

21:29.636 --> 21:31.202
This was a test?

21:31.202 --> 21:32.552
We had to know
for sure, what you could do.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.555
And now we do, and so do you.

21:35.555 --> 21:37.339
He didn't think you could.

21:37.339 --> 21:39.080
Get off of me.
You owe me a beer.

21:39.080 --> 21:40.429
Bastards!

21:40.429 --> 21:44.303
To Holland.
To Holland.

21:46.609 --> 21:49.177
Shots.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.354
How are you?

21:52.354 --> 21:55.792
I, uh, I'd
like to be very drunk.

21:55.792 --> 21:58.186
Well, you've earned it.

21:59.013 --> 22:00.101
Cheers.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.669
Cheers.
Cheers.

22:07.151 --> 22:09.763
Are you listening, I quit.
Cas, are you listening?

22:09.763 --> 22:11.852
Yeah.

22:11.852 --> 22:15.246
How are you?
Good.

22:15.246 --> 22:17.771
Happy anniversary!

22:17.771 --> 22:19.338
Happy anniversary!
Yay.

22:19.338 --> 22:21.340
Yay!

22:22.863 --> 22:25.474
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.346
You must've used all
your butter in this.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.348
Don't
you worry about that.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.350
Well, I still think
we should've waited for Jan.

22:31.350 --> 22:33.134
We'll save him some cake.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.744
Tell Jan he's missed.

22:36.050 --> 22:37.791
All right. Everyone down.
Everybody down.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.183
Peter.
Peter.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.837
Cover your heads.
Cover your heads.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.839
Come, come,
quick, quick, quick.

22:44.624 --> 22:46.365
Pim!
It's all right.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.020
It's okay.
What did I say, darling?

22:50.020 --> 22:51.761
The air raids are good,
because it means the English

22:51.761 --> 22:53.502
are knocking the
daylights out of the Nazi.

22:53.502 --> 22:55.330
Are knocking the
daylights out of the Nazi, yes.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.290
They're
gonna shoot a plane down
right into our building.

22:59.290 --> 23:00.379
It's all right.
It's all right.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.510
No, Gusti.
Well?

23:02.772 --> 23:04.295
What are they doing?

23:04.295 --> 23:06.863
They're knocking the
daylights out of the Nazis!

23:06.863 --> 23:09.126
That's right.

23:19.528 --> 23:22.879
Oh my God. I got to go.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.316
It's my anniversary.

23:25.316 --> 23:28.711
Oh, well, to
your anniversary then.

23:32.236 --> 23:34.848
And to tomorrow night.

23:43.770 --> 23:46.729
You don't need, you
don't need to come tomorrow.

23:46.729 --> 23:50.211
I got someone to
replace you anyway.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.257
Martyrdom is sexy,
but it's not very smart.

23:53.257 --> 23:56.913
It's, it's fine to
look after yourself.

23:56.913 --> 24:01.265
I am looking after myself.

24:01.265 --> 24:04.094
I feel like a coward, if I
live the rest of this war just

24:04.094 --> 24:09.317
stealing IDs and ferrying
groceries to hidden people,

24:09.317 --> 24:12.929
knowing that you
all risked everything.

24:13.626 --> 24:16.672
I'll live the rest of my life
feeling like I didn't do enough.

24:16.672 --> 24:18.065
Hmm.

24:18.065 --> 24:21.068
Trust me, even if you
do go tomorrow and even if

24:21.068 --> 24:22.939
you get out safely,

24:22.939 --> 24:25.986
you always feel like
you never did enough.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.255
Oh, sorry.
No, it's fine.

24:34.255 --> 24:37.780
It's fine. Is she asleep?

24:37.780 --> 24:41.349
Yeah, finally.

24:43.177 --> 24:46.267
You know, the last time
that I found you crying,

24:46.267 --> 24:50.314
I remember that I, I, I
told you to marry your Dutchman

24:50.314 --> 24:52.273
and perhaps it...

24:52.273 --> 24:55.624
It's fine. We're fine.

24:55.624 --> 24:59.846
Good.
So why are you crying?

25:02.326 --> 25:05.242
I was just thinking
about these shoes that

25:05.242 --> 25:08.028
I wanted to buy.

25:08.028 --> 25:12.641
Shoes?
I know. I know.

25:12.641 --> 25:15.339
They're really nice shoes and

25:16.166 --> 25:19.039
obviously I can't afford them.

25:19.561 --> 25:24.348
And then, I thought,
"Where would I even wear them?"

25:24.348 --> 25:26.699
And I couldn't think of a,

25:26.699 --> 25:32.269
of a world where I'd
wear them, ever again.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.233
Buy the shoes.

25:39.233 --> 25:40.974
I never
should've brought it up.

25:40.974 --> 25:43.193
You have to.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.675
I just spent almost an hour
there trying to convince Anne

25:46.675 --> 25:49.330
that we'll find
our way through this.

25:49.330 --> 25:54.335
That she has something
to look forward to.

25:54.335 --> 25:58.295
And if you found a pair of shoes
that makes you feel like this,

25:58.295 --> 26:02.691
give you hope, something
to look forward to.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.302
Buy them.

26:05.302 --> 26:08.436
It's a good pair of shoes.

26:13.659 --> 26:15.704
Goodnight.

26:15.704 --> 26:17.924
Night.

26:32.242 --> 26:35.419
Hello? Miep.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.421
Cas?
We need to talk.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.685
If we still do that.

26:39.685 --> 26:41.425
Oh, God.
Is it Mom and Dad?

26:41.425 --> 26:42.688
No, no. They're fine.

26:42.688 --> 26:46.735
It's, uh, it's about Jan.

26:48.563 --> 26:52.219
I have seen Jan the
past few weeks, um,

26:52.219 --> 26:54.917
meeting with these people
and drinking with them

26:54.917 --> 27:00.706
in this particular bar.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.753
A bar for homosexuals.

27:04.753 --> 27:06.668
You think Jan...

27:06.668 --> 27:11.586
No, uh, it's not
just a bar for homosexuals.

27:11.586 --> 27:17.461
It's a bar where
Resistance fighters meet.

27:23.511 --> 27:27.341
So this is what all
the secrets been about?

27:27.341 --> 27:30.518
Why you've stopped
coming to see us,

27:31.171 --> 27:36.002
because you and Jan are
working for the Resistance?

27:39.701 --> 27:42.530
Yes.
All right.

27:42.530 --> 27:46.577
And so this, this
thing Jan is gonna do.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.623
Aren't you worried?

27:48.623 --> 27:50.669
What thing?

27:50.669 --> 27:52.496
Well, I don't
know what it is.

27:52.496 --> 27:53.976
I thought you would.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.325
No, he
doesn't tell me anything.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.240
What, what thing?

27:57.240 --> 28:01.070
Um, well, the,
the guy I'm seeing is in

28:01.070 --> 28:03.290
with the Resistance people

28:03.290 --> 28:04.900
and he says that they're
planning something.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.686
They're gonna, um,
kill somebody or,

28:07.686 --> 28:10.210
or blow something up,
something big.

28:10.210 --> 28:13.866
When?
Tonight.

28:14.823 --> 28:16.825
Miep, they're, they're,
they're acting like nobody's

28:16.825 --> 28:18.305
coming back from this.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.872
They've been drinking
and, and, and, and

28:19.872 --> 28:22.831
toasting like they're
going off to war.

28:22.831 --> 28:26.052
You have to speak to him.

28:34.408 --> 28:38.151
I found this in
your underwear drawer.

28:45.985 --> 28:49.858
Jan, Jan you said it was, you
said it was shuffling papers.

28:49.858 --> 28:51.381
Don't worry.

28:51.381 --> 28:54.776
Don't placate me
and do not lie to me.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.606
I deserve to know.

29:00.826 --> 29:05.308
Look at me.
Is it dangerous?

29:05.308 --> 29:09.835
Could you die? Will you die?

29:09.835 --> 29:12.707
Do you really want to know?

29:12.707 --> 29:15.405
Yes, it's dangerous.

29:15.405 --> 29:18.844
Maybe I'll die.

29:24.937 --> 29:27.417
No, you can't go.

29:27.417 --> 29:30.986
What?
Do you love me?

29:30.986 --> 29:34.076
Are you serious?
If you do you won't go.

29:34.076 --> 29:37.427
Miep, you can't say that.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.908
You can't say that.

29:39.908 --> 29:45.784
Miep, I'm a Dutchman
and my country needs me.

29:46.132 --> 29:50.397
I need you. I need you.

29:50.397 --> 29:53.835
Jan, this is my line.

29:53.835 --> 29:56.446
Everyone has one
and this is mine.

29:56.446 --> 29:59.449
Please, don't go.
Please, you can't go.

29:59.449 --> 30:02.104
If you love me you cannot go.

30:02.104 --> 30:06.500
Don't go. Don't go.

30:23.473 --> 30:26.172
I'll see you later.

30:46.018 --> 30:50.326
Miep, I am
so glad to see you.

30:50.326 --> 30:52.198
Pim says that I can't
speak to Peter anymore

30:52.198 --> 30:55.027
because it's too inappropriate.

30:55.027 --> 30:57.899
Actually, your father
is just who I come to talk to.

30:57.899 --> 30:59.945
Oh, you can't speak
to him now, he's in a mood.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.685
He's got a headache, well
it's because of the air raid.

31:01.685 --> 31:03.992
He's been staying up with
me because I can't sleep

31:03.992 --> 31:05.820
but listen.

31:05.820 --> 31:09.911
If I could have
five consecutive minutes.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.348
It's all Mother.

31:12.348 --> 31:14.046
It doesn't sound like Pim.

31:14.046 --> 31:16.918
Mother doesn't
understand what love is.

31:16.918 --> 31:18.920
I mean, her marriage is
a loveless partnership,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.356
a marriage of convenience.

31:20.356 --> 31:22.881
God, Anne, Anne you
have this idea about love.

31:22.881 --> 31:24.883
It's not real.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.667
It's not the
dream you think it is.

31:26.667 --> 31:28.495
Nobody has a love like that.

31:28.495 --> 31:30.714
You and Jan do.

31:30.714 --> 31:32.978
Jan and I were a
marriage of convenience.

31:32.978 --> 31:35.284
I married him so I could
stay in the country.

31:35.284 --> 31:37.591
Everything you remember about
my wedding is completely wrong,

31:37.591 --> 31:40.942
it was the scariest
day of my life.

31:42.813 --> 31:46.513
I was committing
fraud that day, Anne!

31:46.513 --> 31:48.907
I was trying to get married
with an invalid passport and

31:48.907 --> 31:51.474
I could have been deported.

31:52.823 --> 31:55.348
I forgot to say "I do" not
because I was swooning over Jan,

31:55.348 --> 31:57.741
but because I was terrified that
a man would see the stamped page

31:57.741 --> 32:01.267
on my passport and have
me arrested there and then.

32:11.407 --> 32:13.366
Excuse me. Sorry.

32:13.366 --> 32:16.630
Thank God Jan
coughed to distract him.

32:18.458 --> 32:22.070
I was trying not to
get arrested, just like you.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.767
And to confuse
that with love, well,

32:23.767 --> 32:26.248
it's just stupid.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.163
Do you understand?

32:28.163 --> 32:29.686
Listen, you're growing up.

32:29.686 --> 32:33.081
Maybe it's time to start acting
a bit grown-up about this.

32:33.081 --> 32:37.172
The best and safest
thing you could do is
steer clear of Peter.

32:37.172 --> 32:40.088
Love will only get you hurt.

32:41.524 --> 32:45.528
I understand. I will.

32:45.528 --> 32:46.790
Good.

32:46.790 --> 32:48.879
Miep.

32:48.879 --> 32:52.057
Anne, go upstairs.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.671
I need to talk to you.

32:57.671 --> 33:01.066
I asked you to discourage
Anne from getting involved

33:01.066 --> 33:02.632
with the Van Pels boy.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.460
Not to scare her out
of ever falling in love.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.159
Sorry, sorry.

33:08.290 --> 33:12.251
What's wrong?

33:12.251 --> 33:14.993
What's happened
between you and Jan?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.342
We're struggling.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.604
It's bad.

33:17.604 --> 33:20.085
It's, it's really bad.

33:20.085 --> 33:22.957
Well, yeah,
well these are trying
times for any marriage.

33:22.957 --> 33:25.351
And the war makes
things even more complicated.

33:25.351 --> 33:26.874
No.

33:26.874 --> 33:30.399
No, he's, he's going to do
something really dangerous,

33:30.399 --> 33:32.314
you know, for,
for the war effort.

33:32.314 --> 33:35.317
And I, I asked him not to go
and he said he'd be back,

33:35.317 --> 33:40.888
but he knows he might
not and he just left.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.546
Yeah. I understand.

33:49.549 --> 33:51.855
Ten years ago,
Otto came to me and said,

33:51.855 --> 33:54.467
"I have a terrible feeling.

33:54.467 --> 33:58.079
I'm moving you and the
girls out of Germany."

33:58.079 --> 34:00.038
Well, I didn't want to go, Miep.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.083
I mean, if you'd seen
the life I had in Germany,

34:02.083 --> 34:05.913
you'd wanted to stay, too.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.047
But I looked him in
the eye and I said,

34:09.047 --> 34:10.657
"All right, let's go."

34:10.657 --> 34:13.877
And he brought us
here for our safety.

34:13.877 --> 34:16.532
And I hated him.

34:16.532 --> 34:20.667
God, I hated Otto for
taking it away from me.

34:20.667 --> 34:22.190
Thank God
you believed him.

34:22.190 --> 34:25.193
No, I didn't
believe him, I knew him.

34:25.193 --> 34:27.369
I know his heart
and he knows mine.

34:27.369 --> 34:31.765
And even when I hated him,
I never stopped loving him.

34:43.777 --> 34:46.171
Marriages grow up too, Miep.

34:46.171 --> 34:50.000
You have to let them.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.091
Anne calls our
marriage passionless, but,

34:53.091 --> 34:55.571
but she doesn't know.

34:55.571 --> 35:01.055
Otto knows how to
keep us safe and how I
want to raise a daughter,

35:01.055 --> 35:03.753
and how I like,
exactly to take my tea.

35:03.753 --> 35:07.105
There's something
very romantic in that.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.019
Don't you think?

35:09.019 --> 35:10.543
Mm-hmm.

35:10.543 --> 35:12.762
You know, Anne, she
doesn't know about all that.

35:12.762 --> 35:15.548
And she, she's brilliant, yeah,

35:15.548 --> 35:18.942
she's impertinent,
but she's only 14.

35:18.942 --> 35:22.946
She's only 14.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.562
Mama! Mama!
What?

35:29.562 --> 35:31.433
They're back.
It was so close.

35:31.433 --> 35:32.956
But there's
no air raid signal!

35:32.956 --> 35:34.697
What was that?

35:34.697 --> 35:38.266
It wasn't anti-aircraft!

35:38.832 --> 35:42.314
Jan. I have to go.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.784
That was
definitely the Resistance.

37:01.784 --> 37:02.872
Yeah, but
why would we blow up

37:02.872 --> 37:04.352
our own building, though?

37:04.352 --> 37:05.919
Oh, Bep.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.051
So the Nazis will
have no records of the Jews.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.880
Oh, the records.

37:12.578 --> 37:13.840
Morning.
Good morning.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.058
Did you hear?

37:15.058 --> 37:16.495
The records
building was bombed and

37:16.495 --> 37:18.236
the Nazis arrested a
bunch of Resistance fighters.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.412
I heard.
You're late.

37:20.412 --> 37:23.197
We're almost open.
Did you sleep in?

37:26.418 --> 37:29.072
No.

37:30.944 --> 37:32.075
I've got
something to show you.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.294
But you can't be angry with me.

37:33.294 --> 37:34.556
Jan. Is Jan here?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.254
Look right here.
What?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.646
I don't see anything.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.866
Peter kissed me.
I mean, right here.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.476
It was a little awkward
because I was turning my head,

37:41.476 --> 37:44.218
but oh, he kissed me right
there with both of his lips!

37:44.218 --> 37:46.960
I mean, I've had my first kiss!

37:52.966 --> 37:56.448
Can you put
the groceries away?

38:03.368 --> 38:04.934
Hey, when's
Jan coming home?

38:04.934 --> 38:07.807
We thought we
could play bridge or...

38:11.158 --> 38:12.942
I'm not sure.

38:12.942 --> 38:17.077
Is there,
is everything okay?

38:17.077 --> 38:19.906
Is there
anything we could do for you?

38:19.906 --> 38:23.736
If you have any
plates or mugs in your bedroom,

38:23.736 --> 38:26.129
you could bring them in here.

38:26.129 --> 38:29.176
Thanks.

38:43.712 --> 38:46.759
Are you all right?
Yeah.

38:55.202 --> 38:57.639
Cas! Hi!

38:57.639 --> 38:59.641
Hi.
Do you know anything?

38:59.641 --> 39:00.990
No. Do you?
No.

39:00.990 --> 39:02.383
It's been two days. Right.

39:02.383 --> 39:05.168
Well, we should go and
find some answers, then.

39:05.168 --> 39:06.387
Come on.

39:06.387 --> 39:07.562
I have to go.

39:07.562 --> 39:08.955
It's Jan. He's...

39:08.955 --> 39:10.304
It's all right. Go, go!

39:10.304 --> 39:12.219
Please, go.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.495
Ah. She's here.

39:33.501 --> 39:38.506
Hi. We're looking for Jan Gies.

39:38.506 --> 39:42.858
I don't know a Jan Gies.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.732
Well, you do
because I've seen you with him.

39:46.732 --> 39:49.125
I don't know a Jan Gies.

39:49.125 --> 39:51.519
Jan is my husband.

39:51.519 --> 39:55.218
I just, I just need to
know if he's been arrested

39:55.218 --> 39:58.047
or if he's alive, or...

39:58.047 --> 40:02.704
I just, I just
need to know, please?

40:02.704 --> 40:07.187
I'm sorry.
I don't know a Jan Gies.

40:09.058 --> 40:14.716
Let's go.
No one's gonna talk in here.

40:14.716 --> 40:17.937
They're all too scared.

40:20.287 --> 40:21.723
All of you've
been asking and

40:21.723 --> 40:25.553
I can't keep saying it
over and over,

40:25.553 --> 40:29.078
so I'll tell you what I
do know once and for all.

40:29.078 --> 40:32.386
Because we all know
the official news is crap.

40:34.432 --> 40:37.130
As you know, the
Resistance has blown up

40:37.130 --> 40:38.392
the Civil Registry Office.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.571
For reasons I cannot fathom,

40:43.571 --> 40:46.269
the Nazis believe some of
our friends are responsible.

40:48.489 --> 40:50.491
Some of our friends
are unaccounted for.

40:50.491 --> 40:53.581
Some have been arrested.

40:53.973 --> 40:57.455
Here are the ones that
we know are in custody.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.198
Johann Brouwer.

41:02.198 --> 41:05.332
Cornelius Roos.

41:06.420 --> 41:09.336
Cees Hoenig.

41:11.512 --> 41:15.081
Rudi Bloemgarten,
sentenced to death.

41:18.084 --> 41:21.827
Carl Groeger,
sentenced to death.

41:25.787 --> 41:32.359
Willem Arondeus,
sentenced to death.

41:40.976 --> 41:45.154
Willem has made a statement and
his lawyer has passed this on.

41:45.154 --> 41:48.723
The statement is this,

41:49.768 --> 41:54.294
"Let it be known that
homosexuals are not cowards."

43:41.183 --> 43:43.229
What's this?
I, I don't know.

43:43.229 --> 43:46.319
It was there when I got here.

43:58.505 --> 44:01.900
It's German. What does it say?

44:05.817 --> 44:08.646
Shit field.

44:11.213 --> 44:16.654
Jan! Jan! Oh, my God.

44:19.004 --> 44:21.093
I thought you were gone!

44:21.093 --> 44:24.531
I thought I'd
never see you again.

44:33.845 --> 44:37.326
You didn't go.

44:37.762 --> 44:43.202
You didn't go because of
me and, well, now you hate me.

44:45.987 --> 44:50.339
I love you.

44:50.339 --> 44:53.560
I love you, too.

44:56.737 --> 44:59.740
Are you coming home?

45:00.741 --> 45:06.181
It's still dangerous
for you, for our friends.

45:06.181 --> 45:09.663
I wasn't there,
but if people talk,

45:09.663 --> 45:12.361
they could name me.

45:12.361 --> 45:15.364
I won't ask
you to stop, I, I won't,

45:15.364 --> 45:19.586
but I need you to tell me.

45:20.543 --> 45:23.198
If you're in danger, I need
to be in danger with you.

45:45.917 --> 45:48.876
I'll see you soon.

46:13.161 --> 46:16.774
Is that for me?
Yes, yes. Sit down.

46:17.775 --> 46:21.648
Firstly, I want to apologize,
I was wrong about you and Peter,

46:21.648 --> 46:24.607
I shouldn't
have told you to stop
feeling what you're feeling.

46:24.607 --> 46:29.134
Actually, I, I think
I was wrong about Peter.

46:30.135 --> 46:34.226
I think that he needs me
more than I need him.

46:35.575 --> 46:37.751
What? What?

46:37.751 --> 46:39.274
Nothing, nothing.

46:39.274 --> 46:42.800
You're just, you're growing up.

46:42.800 --> 46:46.455
And you, you are
not waiting, so.

46:48.501 --> 46:51.069
Oh! That is one of my
favorite dresses of yours!

46:51.069 --> 46:52.244
Good!

46:52.244 --> 46:53.811
Because it's one
of my favorites, too.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.638
Of yours.

46:55.638 --> 46:57.771
Miep. Wait, really?

46:57.771 --> 46:59.642
You need
clothes that fit you.

46:59.642 --> 47:01.122
Wait, this one's mine?
Mm-hmm.

47:01.122 --> 47:03.342
Wait, really?

47:03.864 --> 47:09.870
And you need these.

47:11.219 --> 47:13.178
Those are for me?
Mm-hmm.

47:13.178 --> 47:14.657
Thought I wanted
them for myself,

47:14.657 --> 47:17.138
but I don't need these.

47:17.138 --> 47:18.879
You do.

47:18.879 --> 47:21.142
No one's downstairs.
Go on. Try them on.

47:21.142 --> 47:23.884
Okay.

47:23.884 --> 47:28.497
Oh, those look great.
I absolutely love them.

47:28.497 --> 47:30.978
Oh. Miep, where am
I gonna wear these?

47:30.978 --> 47:32.850
Everywhere.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.678
You'll wear them to a
job interview, and to dinner.

47:35.678 --> 47:38.507
That's for a girl
who's just getting started.

47:38.507 --> 47:42.598
You'll wear them dancing,
maybe you'll kiss a boy in them,

47:42.598 --> 47:44.992
maybe the wrong boy,
but that's okay.

47:44.992 --> 47:48.169
You'll make mistakes,
you'll learn from them,

47:48.169 --> 47:51.956
and you'll just
continue to grow.

47:51.956 --> 47:54.828
And I can't wait to see it.
