<i>Previously on </i> The Big Bang Theory...

00:02.170 --> 00:05.585
I am going to the Arctic Circle
with Leonard, Wolowitz and Koothrappali.

00:05.841 --> 00:07.677
- For three months?
- Yes.

00:08.145 --> 00:11.079
What did you mean when you said
you were going to miss me?

00:13.333 --> 00:15.508
It means I wish you weren't going.

00:30.172 --> 00:31.448
Thank God we're home.

00:31.616 --> 00:35.248
I can't believe we spent three months
in that frozen hell.

00:35.787 --> 00:39.289
It was like a snowy nightmare
from which there was no awakening.

00:39.916 --> 00:42.335
I don't know what Arctic expedition
you guys were on,

00:42.460 --> 00:44.543
but I thought it was
a hoot and a half.

00:47.962 --> 00:48.962
Hi, Mom.

00:50.213 --> 00:53.135
I told you I'd call you when I got home.
I'm not home yet.

00:54.711 --> 00:56.157
All right, I'm home.

00:57.497 --> 01:00.285
The Arctic expedition
was a remarkable success.

01:00.410 --> 01:02.800
I'm all but certain
there's a Nobel Prize in my future.

01:03.315 --> 01:05.649
Actually, I shouldn't say that.
I'm entirely certain.

01:07.861 --> 01:11.111
No, Mother, I could not feel
your church group praying for my safety.

01:12.413 --> 01:14.462
The fact that I'm home safe
doesn't prove it worked.

01:14.587 --> 01:16.648
That logic is post hoc
ergo propter hoc.

01:18.523 --> 01:21.245
No, I'm not sassing you
in Eskimo talk.

01:22.987 --> 01:24.523
I'm gonna let Penny know we're back.

01:24.648 --> 01:27.388
Mother, I have to go.
Love you. Bye.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.791
Hello, old friend.

01:39.718 --> 01:41.054
Daddy's home.

01:44.284 --> 01:45.604
Leonard, you're back.

01:45.774 --> 01:47.482
I just stopped by to say...

01:53.275 --> 01:54.275
So, hi.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.834
Damn it, I should have gone over
and told her we were back.

02:11.805 --> 02:14.180
Yeah, it was
first-come, first-serve.

02:16.430 --> 02:19.473

02:41.330 --> 02:42.704
I just want you both to know,

02:42.872 --> 02:46.039
when I publish my findings,
I won't forget your contributions.

02:46.498 --> 02:47.809
- Great.
- Thanks.

02:48.211 --> 02:50.502
Of course, I can't mention you
in my Nobel acceptance speech,

02:50.627 --> 02:52.430
but when I get around
to writing my memoirs,

02:52.555 --> 02:55.974
you can expect a very effusive footnote
and perhaps a signed copy.

02:57.684 --> 02:58.885
We have to tell him.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.107
Tell me what?

03:01.501 --> 03:03.095
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

03:04.713 --> 03:06.935
You fellows are planning a party
for me, aren't you?

03:07.936 --> 03:09.564
Okay, Sheldon, sit down.

03:10.450 --> 03:13.000
If there's going to be a theme,
I should let you know

03:13.125 --> 03:15.527
that I don't care for luau, toga
or "under the sea."

03:17.891 --> 03:19.948
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.
Look...

03:20.373 --> 03:24.126
We need to talk to you about something
that happened at the North Pole.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.613
If this is about the night
the heat went out,

03:26.738 --> 03:29.144
there's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

03:30.687 --> 03:33.616
- It's not about that.
- We agreed to never speak of it again.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.882
So we slept together naked.

03:38.937 --> 03:41.763
It was only to keep our core body
temperatures from plummeting.

03:43.311 --> 03:44.853
He's speaking about it.

03:45.602 --> 03:47.650
For me, it was a bonding moment.

03:51.939 --> 03:54.609
Sheldon, you remember
the first few weeks

03:54.777 --> 03:56.812
we were looking
for magnetic monopoles

03:56.937 --> 03:58.351
and not finding anything

03:58.476 --> 04:01.957
and you were acting
like an obnoxious, giant dictator?

04:02.542 --> 04:03.992
We were gonna be gentle with him.

04:04.309 --> 04:06.462
That's why I added the "tator."

04:11.127 --> 04:13.501
And when we finally
got our first positive data,

04:13.626 --> 04:14.961
you were so happy.

04:16.125 --> 04:19.192
In the world of emoticons,
I was colon, capital "D."

04:25.758 --> 04:28.754
Well, in actuality,
what your equipment detected

04:28.879 --> 04:32.622
wasn't so much evidence
of paradigm-shifting monopoles

04:32.751 --> 04:33.882
as it was...

04:34.940 --> 04:38.069
static from the electric can opener
we were turning on and off.

04:40.615 --> 04:42.580
He just went colon, capital "O."

04:46.064 --> 04:48.413
- You tampered with my experiment?
- We had to.

04:48.581 --> 04:52.026
It was the only way to keep you
from being such a huge Dickensian.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.674
You see that? I add the "ensian. "

04:57.665 --> 04:59.315
Did Leonard know about this?

04:59.440 --> 05:02.092
Leonard's my best friend in the world.
Surely Leonard didn't know.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.386
It was his idea.

05:03.554 --> 05:06.013
Of course it was.
The whole plan reeks of Leonard.

05:07.767 --> 05:09.628
- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

05:09.753 --> 05:11.784
I couldn't think of anyone else
while you were gone.

05:11.909 --> 05:12.909
Me, neither.

05:14.396 --> 05:16.927
Except for one night
when the heat went out.

05:18.558 --> 05:20.056
Long story. Don't ask.

05:27.190 --> 05:29.606
Do not make a sound.

05:30.733 --> 05:33.161
Whispering,
"Do not make a sound... "

05:34.673 --> 05:35.751
is a sound.

05:37.882 --> 05:39.792
Damn his Vulcan hearing.

05:40.942 --> 05:42.609
Not a good time, Sheldon.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.346
Oh, this is ridiculous.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.226
- What?
- Hello.

05:52.020 --> 05:55.395
I realize you're currently at the mercy
of your primitive biological urges,

05:55.565 --> 05:58.138
but as you have an entire lifetime
of poor decisions ahead of you,

05:58.263 --> 05:59.899
may I interrupt this one?

06:01.366 --> 06:02.986
It's great to see you too.
Come on in.

06:03.983 --> 06:07.065
Wolowitz has informed me
of your grand deception.

06:07.315 --> 06:09.035
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

06:09.203 --> 06:11.398
Yes, I feel terrible about it.

06:11.523 --> 06:14.158
I will never forgive myself,
I don't expect you to, either,

06:14.283 --> 06:16.693
and I would really appreciate it
if you would leave me with Penny

06:16.818 --> 06:19.365
for a session of self-criticism
and repentance.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.468
Can someone please tell me
what's going on here?

06:25.711 --> 06:27.901
What's going on is
I was led to believe

06:28.026 --> 06:30.181
I was making
groundbreaking strides in science,

06:30.349 --> 06:31.598
when in fact, I was being

06:31.768 --> 06:34.352
fed false data at the hands
of Wolowitz, Koothrappali

06:34.477 --> 06:36.457
and your furry little boy toy.

06:38.647 --> 06:39.774
Is that true?

06:39.943 --> 06:42.442
It was the only way
to make him happy.

06:42.612 --> 06:43.945
Make him happy?

06:44.113 --> 06:46.446
When he wasn't happy,
we wanted to kill him.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.726
There was even a plan.

06:51.162 --> 06:53.328
We were going to throw
his Kindle outside,

06:53.453 --> 06:55.038
when he went to get it, lock the door

06:55.208 --> 06:56.748
and let him freeze to death.

06:58.069 --> 07:00.210
That seems like a bit
of an overreaction.

07:00.630 --> 07:02.774
The overreaction
was the plan to tie your limbs

07:02.899 --> 07:05.298
to four different sled dog teams
and yell, "Mush. "

07:08.402 --> 07:09.835
We kept the original data.

07:09.960 --> 07:12.069
You can still publish
the actual results.

07:12.475 --> 07:15.226
Yes, but the actual results
are unsuccessful

07:15.394 --> 07:18.069
and I've already sent an e-mail
to everyone at the university

07:18.194 --> 07:20.049
explaining that I have
confirmed string theory

07:20.174 --> 07:22.525
and forever changed
man's understanding of the universe.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.088
Aw, see, yeah, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

07:26.823 --> 07:29.906
So write another e-mail.
Set the record straight. No big deal.

07:31.879 --> 07:33.326
You're right, Leonard.

07:33.497 --> 07:34.997
It's not a big deal.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.830
All you did was lie to me,
destroy my dream

07:37.955 --> 07:41.005
and humiliate me
in front of the whole university.

07:43.042 --> 07:45.400
That, FYI, was sarcasm.

07:47.132 --> 07:49.532
I, in fact,
believe it is a big deal.

07:51.757 --> 07:53.133
The poor thing.

07:53.258 --> 07:55.348
- Yeah, I feel terrible.
- Wait. Wait.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.642
Aren't you going to go talk to him?

07:57.812 --> 08:00.855
He'll be fine. The guy's a trouper.
Come here.

08:01.697 --> 08:04.382
You're right, you shouldn't talk to him.
I will.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.848
Man, I cannot catch a break.

08:17.694 --> 08:19.194
Do you want to talk?

08:19.325 --> 08:20.375
About what?

08:21.013 --> 08:22.834
Being betrayed by my friends?

08:23.200 --> 08:25.764
Spending three months
at the North Pole for nothing?

08:27.637 --> 08:30.237
And I didn't even get
to go to Comic-Con!

08:33.188 --> 08:34.263
Oh, hon...

08:41.261 --> 08:44.147
<i>Soft kitty, warm kitty</i>

08:44.317 --> 08:46.816
That's for when I'm sick.
Sad is not sick.

08:47.521 --> 08:49.527
Sorry.
I don't know your sad song.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.935
I don't have a sad song.
I'm not a child.

08:54.592 --> 08:57.487
You know, I do understand
what you're going through.

08:57.612 --> 08:58.411
Really?

08:58.742 --> 09:01.813
Did you just have the Nobel Prize
in waitressing stolen from you?

09:03.207 --> 09:06.640
Well, no, but when I was a senior
in high school,

09:06.765 --> 09:09.464
one of my friends heard
I was gonna be named head cheerleader.

09:09.641 --> 09:10.860
I was so excited.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.404
My mom even made me
a celebration pie.

09:14.013 --> 09:16.892
Then they named stupid
Valerie Mossbacher head cheerleader.

09:17.017 --> 09:18.317
Big ol' slutbag.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.527
Are you saying

09:22.001 --> 09:23.772
that you think a "celebration pie"

09:23.897 --> 09:27.052
is even remotely
comparable to a Nobel Prize?

09:28.034 --> 09:29.584
They're pretty tasty.

09:31.843 --> 09:34.861
And on a different,
but not unrelated topic,

09:34.986 --> 09:37.737
based on your current efforts
to buoy my spirits,

09:37.862 --> 09:39.799
do you truly believe
that you were ever fit

09:39.924 --> 09:41.890
to be a cheerleader?

09:47.677 --> 09:50.297
Look, Sheldon, I just don't think
that the guys and Leonard

09:50.481 --> 09:52.290
really meant to hurt you.

09:52.415 --> 09:55.885
They just told an unfortunate lie
to deal with a difficult situation.

09:56.281 --> 09:57.470
You know what it's like?

09:57.640 --> 10:00.831
Remember that scene in the new Star Trek
when Kirk has to take over the ship,

10:01.023 --> 10:03.147
so he tells Spock all that stuff
he knew wasn't true,

10:03.272 --> 10:05.972
like saying
Spock didn't care his mom died?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.317
I missed Comic-Con
and the New Star Trek movie!

10:14.208 --> 10:16.358
- I like the new look.
- Thanks.

10:20.150 --> 10:21.828
I call it "the Clooney."

10:23.400 --> 10:26.000
I call it "the Mario and Luigi,"
but whatever.

10:28.299 --> 10:29.587
How's Sheldon doing?

10:29.789 --> 10:32.515
He came out of his room this morning
wearing his Darth Vader helmet

10:32.640 --> 10:34.532
and tried to choke me to death
with the force,

10:34.657 --> 10:36.528
so I'd say, "a little better."

10:37.996 --> 10:41.681
If I may abruptly change the subject,
did you and Penny finally... You know.

10:42.046 --> 10:45.237
Personally, I don't care,
but my genitals wanted me to ask.

10:46.524 --> 10:49.482
Tell your genitals what I do with Penny
is none of their business.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.667
He says they didn't do it.

10:54.655 --> 10:56.105
Sheldon, over here.

11:10.873 --> 11:12.046
What are you doing?

11:13.336 --> 11:14.986
I feel bad for the guy.

11:18.431 --> 11:20.386
Sheldon, why are you
sitting by yourself?

11:20.557 --> 11:22.275
Because I am without friends.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.276
Like the proverbial cheese,
I stand alone.

11:26.055 --> 11:27.455
Even while seated.

11:27.928 --> 11:29.744
Come on. We said we were sorry.

11:29.869 --> 11:31.679
It's going to take more
than an "I'm sorry"

11:31.804 --> 11:33.742
and a store-bought
apology pie from Penny

11:33.867 --> 11:36.070
to make up
for what you've done to me.

11:37.367 --> 11:38.789
Read your retraction email.

11:38.914 --> 11:41.037
Way to destroy your reputation.

11:42.238 --> 11:43.047
You see?

11:43.172 --> 11:45.745
People have been pointing
and laughing at me all morning.

11:45.915 --> 11:47.215
That's not true.

11:47.683 --> 11:50.126
People have been pointing
and laughing at you your whole life.

11:50.840 --> 11:52.043
I've had enough.

11:52.213 --> 11:53.421
Attention, everyone.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.256
I'm Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

11:55.425 --> 11:57.993
As many of you
in the physics department might know,

11:58.118 --> 12:00.559
my career trajectory
has taken a minor detour.

12:00.684 --> 12:01.784
Off a cliff.

12:04.101 --> 12:05.897
My credibility
may have been damaged...

12:06.022 --> 12:07.110
Completely wrecked.

12:07.235 --> 12:10.254
But I would like to remind you
that in science,

12:10.379 --> 12:11.896
there's no such thing as failure.

12:12.345 --> 12:13.606
There once was a man

12:13.776 --> 12:16.517
who referred to his prediction
of a cosmological constant

12:16.642 --> 12:19.310
as the single "biggest blunder"
of his career.

12:19.435 --> 12:22.283
That man's name was...
surprise, surprise...

12:22.581 --> 12:23.616
Albert Einstein.

12:25.559 --> 12:27.461
Yeah, but research into dark energy

12:27.586 --> 12:29.435
proved that Einstein's
cosmological constant

12:29.560 --> 12:32.181
was actually right all along,
so you're still...

12:32.306 --> 12:33.798
surprise, surprise...

12:33.923 --> 12:34.923
A loser.

12:38.182 --> 12:39.808
You think you're so clever.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.048
Let me just tell you,

12:41.173 --> 12:43.402
while I do not currently
have a scathing retort,

12:43.527 --> 12:46.084
you check your e-mail
periodically for a doozy.

12:51.307 --> 12:53.646
So much for our friendship
with Sheldon.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.483
We'll always have the night
the heat went out.

13:08.176 --> 13:10.055
Since we got interrupted last night,

13:10.180 --> 13:12.124
I didn't have a chance
to give you this.

13:13.404 --> 13:14.854
You shouldn't have.

13:17.226 --> 13:18.226
Oh, boy!

13:20.478 --> 13:21.528
What is it?

13:22.366 --> 13:23.716
It's a snowflake.

13:23.864 --> 13:25.137
From the North Pole.

13:26.424 --> 13:27.724
Are you serious?

13:28.683 --> 13:29.565
It's eternal.

13:29.690 --> 13:32.730
I preserved it in a one percent solution
of polyvinyl acetal resin.

13:38.060 --> 13:40.217
That's the most romantic thing
anyone's ever said to me

13:40.342 --> 13:41.807
that I didn't understand.

13:43.307 --> 13:44.971
It's actually a simple process.

13:45.096 --> 13:48.032
Cyanoacrylates are monomers
which polymerize on...

13:52.340 --> 13:54.082
Red alert, Leonard.
Sheldon ran away.

13:54.251 --> 13:55.822
Man, I cannot catch a break.

13:57.387 --> 13:59.046
So, how do you know he ran away?

13:59.280 --> 14:00.872
Well, he's not answering his phone,

14:00.997 --> 14:03.172
he handed in his
resignation at the university

14:03.297 --> 14:06.345
and he sent me a text
that said, "I'm running away."

14:07.264 --> 14:08.747
Thanks for letting me know.

14:08.872 --> 14:10.640
Aren't you going to do something?

14:11.280 --> 14:13.685
Of course I'm going to do something.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.311
Howard, you check the comic book store.
Raj, go to the thai restaurant.

14:17.436 --> 14:19.604
I'll stay here with Penny
in her apartment.

14:21.411 --> 14:22.599
Oh, damn it.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.988
It's Sheldon's mother.

14:25.257 --> 14:27.007
A break cannot be caught.

14:28.163 --> 14:29.284
Hi, Mrs. Cooper.

14:30.318 --> 14:32.518
He is?
Sheldon went home to Texas.

14:34.037 --> 14:35.987
Yeah, no, I know he resigned.

14:37.906 --> 14:40.006
I guess it kind of is our fault.

14:41.158 --> 14:43.703
No, you're right.
Someone needs to come talk to him.

14:43.828 --> 14:45.672
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.

14:46.627 --> 14:47.627
All right.

14:48.994 --> 14:49.994
New plan.

14:50.126 --> 14:53.401
Howard, you and Raj go to Texas.
I'll stay with Penny in her apartment.

14:54.586 --> 14:55.977
You're not gonna go with them?

14:56.189 --> 14:58.660
Well, you know,
I gave you the snowflake

14:58.785 --> 15:00.059
and we were kissing and...

15:00.184 --> 15:02.150
Come on,
I don't want to go to Texas!

15:03.380 --> 15:06.080
Oh, right, and I do?
My people already crossed a desert once.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.255
We're done.

15:11.097 --> 15:12.619
Trust me, you'll be fine. See ya.

15:13.226 --> 15:14.615
Well, wait a second, Leonard.

15:14.740 --> 15:17.044
Come on, how can you not go?
He's your best friend.

15:17.169 --> 15:19.564
Yeah, but I already saw him naked.
Just come here.

15:20.814 --> 15:23.064
I promise I will be here
when you get back.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.673
Just go help Sheldon.

15:25.565 --> 15:26.628
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:26.753 --> 15:29.323
We waited a few months.
We can wait a few more days.

15:34.378 --> 15:35.578
Maybe you can.

15:38.093 --> 15:39.093
Go.

15:41.338 --> 15:43.838
Boy, you cannot
catch a break, can you?

15:47.535 --> 15:49.035
Here you go, Shelly.

15:49.459 --> 15:50.559
Thanks, Mom.

15:52.929 --> 15:54.563
Hold your horses, young man.

15:54.688 --> 15:56.621
Here in Texas,
we pray before we eat.

15:56.860 --> 15:57.860
Aw, Mom.

15:57.985 --> 16:00.735
This is not California,
land of the heathen.

16:02.503 --> 16:03.503
Gimme.

16:07.901 --> 16:09.987
By His hand we are all...

16:11.253 --> 16:12.253
... fed.

16:12.456 --> 16:14.245
Give us, Lord, our daily...

16:15.059 --> 16:16.081
... bread.

16:16.206 --> 16:18.532
- Please know that we are truly...
- ... grateful.

16:18.657 --> 16:21.291
- For every cup and every...
- ... plateful.

16:25.722 --> 16:27.569
Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?

16:28.195 --> 16:29.969
My objection was based
on considerations

16:30.094 --> 16:31.694
other than difficulty.

16:32.741 --> 16:34.544
Whatever.
Jesus still loves you.

16:37.756 --> 16:40.356
Thank you for carving a smiley face
in my grilled cheese sandwich.

16:40.481 --> 16:42.467
Oh, I know
how to take care of my baby.

16:43.447 --> 16:46.500
His eyes came out a little thin,
but you can just pretend he's Chinese.

16:51.780 --> 16:53.719
So, do you want to talk about

16:53.844 --> 16:56.431
what happened with you
and your little friends?

16:57.110 --> 16:59.351
- They're not my friends.
- All right.

17:02.058 --> 17:04.088
If you recall, when you were little,

17:04.213 --> 17:06.107
we sat right here at this very spot

17:06.319 --> 17:07.756
and we talked about the problems

17:07.881 --> 17:10.153
you had getting along
with the neighbor kids.

17:10.323 --> 17:11.405
That was different.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.185
They were threatened
by my intelligence

17:13.310 --> 17:15.863
and too stupid to know
that's why they hated me.

17:18.655 --> 17:21.172
Oh baby, they knew very well
why they hated you.

17:33.268 --> 17:35.428
I can't believe
you bought a red cowboy hat.

17:35.817 --> 17:38.053
Hello?
I'm wearing a red turtleneck.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.918
Plus, it was the only boys' large
they had.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.497
I'm sorry,
this does not look like Texas.

17:49.622 --> 17:51.779
Where's the tumbleweeds?
Whe's the saloons?

17:51.904 --> 17:52.904
Saloons?

17:53.074 --> 17:54.889
Like in the movies
I saw growing up in India.

17:55.014 --> 17:57.892
You know, <i>Four for Texas</i>,
<i>Yellow Rose of Texas.</i>

17:58.150 --> 18:01.343
This neighborhood is more
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>.

18:03.084 --> 18:05.041
I was really hoping
to see a cattle drive.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.333
What can I tell you?

18:06.747 --> 18:09.667
They probably have steaks on sale
at that big-ass Costco over there.

18:19.489 --> 18:21.644
Will you please
take that stupid hat off?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.518
No, I want to blend in.

18:25.418 --> 18:27.093
To what? <i>Toy Story?</i>

18:30.008 --> 18:32.027
- Hi, boys.
- Howdy, ma'am.

18:32.195 --> 18:34.479
Howdy to you, too.
You got here quick.

18:34.604 --> 18:36.531
- We took the red-eye.
- Well, come on in.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.049
Thank you kindly.

18:38.961 --> 18:41.385
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No, thank you.

18:41.510 --> 18:44.877
If y'all don't mind,
I got a hankerin' for a Lone Star beer.

18:47.166 --> 18:50.458
There's no alcohol in this household.
Stop talking like that and lose the hat.

18:53.346 --> 18:55.732
Sorry. I'll take a diet Yoo-Hoo
if you have it.

18:57.529 --> 18:58.979
You'll take a cola.

18:59.950 --> 19:01.931
What about you?
Radge, isn't it?

19:02.460 --> 19:04.639
You still having trouble
talking to the ladies?

19:05.527 --> 19:06.840
Because, at our church,

19:06.965 --> 19:09.184
we have a woman
who's an amazing healer.

19:09.435 --> 19:12.010
Mostly she does
crutch and wheelchair people,

19:12.492 --> 19:14.983
but I bet she'd be willing
to take a shot

19:15.108 --> 19:18.156
at whatever Third World demon
is running around inside of you.

19:20.625 --> 19:21.651
If you don't mind,

19:21.776 --> 19:23.837
there's a 3:05 nonstop
back to Los Angeles

19:23.962 --> 19:26.581
and you have no idea
how much I want to be on it.

19:27.373 --> 19:29.539
- A girl?
- Uh, yes, ma'am.

19:29.753 --> 19:31.363
Oh, good.
I been praying for you.

19:37.603 --> 19:39.827
- What are they doing here?
- We came to apologize.

19:39.952 --> 19:41.540
- Again.
- And bring you home.

19:41.665 --> 19:43.764
Why don't you pack up your stuff
and we'll head back?

19:45.335 --> 19:47.120
No, this is my home now.

19:47.539 --> 19:49.497
Thanks to you, my career is over

19:49.622 --> 19:51.854
and I will spend
the rest of my life here in Texas

19:51.979 --> 19:54.070
trying to teach evolution
to creationists.

19:58.103 --> 19:59.698
You watch your mouth, Shelly.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.617
Everyone's entitled
to their opinion.

20:02.786 --> 20:05.286
Evolution isn't an opinion,
it's fact.

20:05.541 --> 20:07.942
And that is your opinion.

20:11.665 --> 20:13.579
I forgive you.
Let's go home.

20:18.521 --> 20:20.459
Don't tell me prayer doesn't work.

20:27.281 --> 20:29.861
How about that?
I finally caught a break.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.637
You know how they say
when friends have sex,

20:41.762 --> 20:43.112
it can get weird?

20:43.446 --> 20:44.446
Sure.

20:45.883 --> 20:47.883
Why does it have to get weird?

20:48.636 --> 20:49.786
I don't know.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.510
I mean,

20:52.298 --> 20:54.988
we were friends,
and now we're more than friends.

20:55.572 --> 20:57.322
We're whatever "this" is.

20:57.582 --> 20:59.832
But why label it, right?
I mean...

21:00.682 --> 21:02.071
It is what it is and...

21:02.196 --> 21:04.396
- Leonard? It's weird.
- Totally.
