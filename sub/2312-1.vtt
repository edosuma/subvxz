01:05.464 --> 01:06.865
<i>Take a look at that view.</i>

01:06.866 --> 01:08.502
<i>Spectacular, isn't it?</i>

01:09.502 --> 01:12.237
But it was here
on the acropolis hill

01:12.238 --> 01:15.440
that some believe
Theseus's father king Aegeus

01:15.441 --> 01:19.443
looked out to sea, waiting
for his son to return.

01:19.444 --> 01:21.479
See, Theseus had
promised his father

01:21.480 --> 01:23.248
that if he defeated
the minotaur,

01:23.249 --> 01:26.251
he'd hoist a white sail
on his ship as a tribute.

01:26.252 --> 01:28.485
But he was so excited
to get back home,

01:28.486 --> 01:30.388
he forgot and he flew
the same black sail

01:30.389 --> 01:31.656
that he set out with.

01:31.657 --> 01:33.690
Well, thinking his son was dead,

01:33.691 --> 01:37.929
the heartbroken king flung
himself onto the rocks below.

01:37.930 --> 01:41.933
Another victim of the cruel
tricks gods play on men.

01:41.934 --> 01:45.170
Well, I hope you ladies
brought your handkerchiefs,

01:45.171 --> 01:46.771
'cause the next thing
you're about to see

01:46.772 --> 01:48.238
has been known to make some weep

01:48.239 --> 01:49.642
at first sight.
Follow me.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.511
<i>Completed in 438 B.C.,</i>

01:53.512 --> 01:55.246
the Parthenon.

01:55.247 --> 01:57.549
From the Greek word <i> "parthenes,"</i>

01:57.550 --> 01:59.920
meaning "virgins."

02:00.920 --> 02:03.720
"The ancient Greeks
were masters of deception.

02:03.721 --> 02:06.291
Even though the base
of the Parthenon appears

02:06.292 --> 02:07.525
straight to the naked eye,

02:07.526 --> 02:09.394
<i>it is, in fact,
completely crooked.</i>

02:09.395 --> 02:11.963
Indeed, if one were
to leave one's hat

02:11.964 --> 02:13.965
on one side of the temple steps,

02:13.966 --> 02:16.466
it would vanish altogether
when viewed from the other."

02:16.467 --> 02:19.571
- You're making this up.
- Oh, only one way to find out.

02:19.572 --> 02:20.738
- Oh.
- Wanna try it?

02:20.739 --> 02:22.440
- All right.
- Come on.

02:22.441 --> 02:24.442
All right.
You go on down there,

02:24.443 --> 02:26.003
- I'll put the hat right here.
- Mm-hmm.

02:26.004 --> 02:27.573
Off you go.

02:28.280 --> 02:29.580
<i>Mmm-mmm-mmm!</i>

02:29.581 --> 02:31.316
<i>I hear that.</i>

02:31.317 --> 02:33.486
- Is this far enough?
- That's perfect.

02:35.486 --> 02:37.722
Oh my God, you're right.

02:37.723 --> 02:39.424
Really?

02:39.425 --> 02:41.359
No.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.460
Aw jeez.

02:43.461 --> 02:46.566
Sucker born every minute.

02:47.566 --> 02:49.723
- Come on, baby.
- I got you.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.727
Oh well.

03:23.301 --> 03:25.470
Gosh, it's so hot.

03:25.471 --> 03:29.608
Yeah. Getting bored
of the Parthenon?

03:31.201 --> 03:34.044
- No no no no.
- Come on, we have to finish the bottle.

03:34.045 --> 03:36.481
I was supposed to meet
my friends an hour ago.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.693
Oh, you just tell 'em you got lost.
I'm a terrible tour guide.

03:41.052 --> 03:43.287
- Let me get this.
- No no no, I got it.

03:43.288 --> 03:44.489
- I got it.
- Thank you.

03:44.490 --> 03:46.691
My pleasure.

03:46.692 --> 03:48.592
Actually, do you have any...

03:48.593 --> 03:50.030
- Small bills?
- Oh, umm...

03:51.030 --> 03:52.630
- Change?
- I think so.

03:52.631 --> 03:55.433
- Shall I take a look?
- Yeah, actually, I'm not sure.

03:55.434 --> 03:56.601
Okay. All right,

03:56.602 --> 03:57.702
so it's four drachmas,

03:57.703 --> 04:01.072
so if I take five and $10,

04:01.073 --> 04:03.740
I'll give you back 200 drachmas.

04:03.741 --> 04:05.643
- Good?
- Okay.

04:05.644 --> 04:07.812
Thank you.

04:12.050 --> 04:13.620
True story.

04:17.622 --> 04:19.724
She's very pretty, isn't she?

04:19.725 --> 04:23.061
Oh no, I was... I was looking
at the guy that she was with.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.797
He reminds me
of my father a little bit.

04:25.798 --> 04:28.700
<i>It says we should go to
the flea market on Sunday.</i>

04:28.701 --> 04:30.734
<i>Apparently it's less crowded.</i>

04:30.735 --> 04:33.770
Don't look now,
but there's a young guy

04:33.771 --> 04:35.873
in a gray shirt
sitting with a girl

04:35.874 --> 04:37.559
in blue and white striped dress.

04:40.962 --> 04:42.647
<i>He was at the Parthenon earlier,</i>

04:42.648 --> 04:44.448
<i>staring at me.</i>

04:44.449 --> 04:46.883
Staring at me now.

04:46.884 --> 04:49.892
Okay.

04:58.130 --> 04:59.502
Now I'm curious.

05:15.814 --> 05:18.583
Oh, I'm sorry,
I don't speak Greek.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.119
- Somebody's in there.
- You're American?

05:21.120 --> 05:23.153
- Yeah.
- Where are you from?

05:23.154 --> 05:25.556
- I'm from Trenton.
- New Jersey?

05:25.557 --> 05:26.758
<i>Yeah.</i>

05:26.759 --> 05:28.592
I thought you were Greek.

05:28.593 --> 05:31.662
I thought you were Greek.

05:31.663 --> 05:33.830
<i>What are you doing in Athens?</i>

05:33.831 --> 05:36.569
Uh, I'm a tour guide.
Do you need one?

05:41.639 --> 05:44.409
He's an American tour guide,
he's been here a year

05:44.410 --> 05:46.643
<i>and before that he went to Yale.</i>

05:46.644 --> 05:49.147
- Do you believe him?
- You can ask him yourself.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.675
He's gonna show us around
the flea market Sunday.

05:53.619 --> 05:55.585
"Rydal."

05:55.586 --> 05:57.688
Fancy.

05:57.689 --> 06:00.691
<i>So Colette tells me
you went to Yale.</i>

06:00.692 --> 06:02.626
<i>- Yes sir.</i>
- What did you major in?

06:02.627 --> 06:05.496
- Economics.
- Hmm.

06:05.497 --> 06:07.498
Good training for a tour guide.

06:07.499 --> 06:09.900
Yeah, well, that wasn't
the plan initially.

06:09.901 --> 06:13.504
My father had a job lined up
at a friend's law firm and...

06:13.505 --> 06:15.540
<i>and you ran away
as fast as you could.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:17.775
<i>Something like that. What do
you do for a living, sir?</i>

06:17.776 --> 06:19.576
Call me Chester.

06:19.577 --> 06:22.513
I look after people's savings,

06:22.514 --> 06:24.614
mostly low-risk investments.
How much?

06:24.615 --> 06:26.220
20 drachmas.

06:28.220 --> 06:29.956
There you go.

06:36.131 --> 06:38.763
- A steal.
- You must be doing pretty well, though,

06:38.764 --> 06:40.004
if you're staying at the grand.

06:40.005 --> 06:42.532
Honey, look at this.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.669
- It's beautiful, isn't it?
- It sure is.

06:45.670 --> 06:47.504
Actually, this is
a Cretan design.

06:47.505 --> 06:50.508
You see how the snakes
come together and never end?

06:50.509 --> 06:52.876
That represents immortality.

06:52.877 --> 06:55.479
People wear it
as a protection charm.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.814
- Oh.
- You like it, hon?

06:57.815 --> 07:00.717
- I love it.
- Well, let's get it then.

07:00.718 --> 07:03.221
How much is it?

07:05.723 --> 07:07.226
2,000 drachmas.

07:11.529 --> 07:12.963
All right, so 1500,

07:12.964 --> 07:14.698
which is about $50.

07:14.699 --> 07:16.566
- 50 bucks?
- Good deal.

07:16.567 --> 07:18.636
Will he take dollars?

07:18.637 --> 07:22.840
Well, you can give me dollars
and I'll give him drachmas.

07:22.841 --> 07:26.779
Okay. Fair enough.

07:27.779 --> 07:29.713
<i>Thank you, honey.</i>

07:29.714 --> 07:31.849
- It looks great on you.
- It's gorgeous.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.818
Say, why don't you
join us for dinner?

07:34.819 --> 07:38.523
- Would you do that?
- Sure, yes, I'd love to.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.857
But I'm... I'm meeting
a friend later.

07:40.858 --> 07:43.828
She can come too.

07:43.829 --> 07:46.297
Honey,

07:46.298 --> 07:48.032
<i>- that's embarrassing.
- No, it got so bad</i>

07:48.033 --> 07:49.967
that we started counting
how many times a day

07:49.968 --> 07:52.869
the Parisians would insult us.
We got up to 15 one night,

07:52.870 --> 07:55.840
- nine in the same restaurant.
- Was it your first time there?

07:55.841 --> 07:58.275
Mmm. Chester helped
liberate Paris.

07:58.276 --> 07:59.576
<i>- Oh, really?</i>
- All by myself.

07:59.577 --> 08:01.546
You fought in the war?

08:01.547 --> 08:03.580
Just the last part.

08:03.581 --> 08:05.653
Whereabouts?

08:07.653 --> 08:11.087
Normandy, the Ardennes,
a few other places.

08:11.088 --> 08:13.992
Wow.

08:14.992 --> 08:16.727
Heck of a joint you picked out.

08:16.728 --> 08:19.729
It's modeled after
the old ottoman cafes.

08:19.730 --> 08:21.665
Huh. Great guide,
isn't he?

08:21.666 --> 08:23.301
<i>- Mmm, wonderful.</i>
- Knows everything.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.570
Mm-hmm.
He's an even better writer.

08:25.571 --> 08:27.737
Is that so?
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

08:27.738 --> 08:30.708
<i>What do you write? The
most beautiful poems.</i>

08:30.709 --> 08:33.043
He's gonna be famous one day.

08:33.044 --> 08:35.046
Happy or depressing poems?

08:35.047 --> 08:37.914
- Unpublished poems, mostly.
- I'm sure you'll find...

08:37.916 --> 08:40.789
- Sir.
- ...Plenty of inspiration in Greece.

08:46.792 --> 08:49.359
And your first date
was yesterday?

08:49.360 --> 08:51.697
- The day before.
- Oh, the day before.

08:54.799 --> 08:57.634
That's the sound and light show.

08:57.635 --> 08:59.395
I can get you tickets
if you're interested...

08:59.396 --> 09:01.037
tomorrow night,
best seats in the house.

09:01.038 --> 09:03.773
Thanks,
but unfortunately, we're...

09:03.774 --> 09:06.677
- we're leaving tomorrow.
- Oh, really?

09:06.678 --> 09:08.812
Yeah, I wanted to show
Colette Rome and Venice

09:08.813 --> 09:11.648
before we go back
to the states, so...

09:11.649 --> 09:13.755
How about you?
Any plans to go home soon?

09:14.019 --> 09:16.988
Uh, yeah, at some point,

09:16.989 --> 09:18.955
when I run out of money.

09:18.956 --> 09:20.556
Doesn't sound like
you're in a big hurry.

09:20.557 --> 09:23.127
Oh, thanks.
Well, Chester,

09:23.128 --> 09:25.763
I gotta figure out
what I wanna do first.

09:25.764 --> 09:27.697
Sure.

09:27.698 --> 09:29.734
That's the best thing
about being your age.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.369
There's a surprise
around every corner.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.006
Yeah, I guess so.

09:35.006 --> 09:37.374
Did you know
that she was a Van Buren?

09:37.375 --> 09:40.812
- Who's that?
- Your friend Lauren.

09:41.812 --> 09:44.114
- I only just met her.
- Mm-hmm.

09:44.115 --> 09:47.123
Was he the seventh
or the eighth president?

09:51.123 --> 09:53.791
- He was the eighth.
- Yeah.

09:53.792 --> 09:55.792
- No, I'm... I'm... I'm not...
- I know, I know.

09:55.793 --> 09:58.995
Hey, listen,
I've been married twice,

09:58.996 --> 10:02.667
both times to beautiful
women with no money.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.935
I'm gonna say this
because I love Colette

10:04.936 --> 10:06.870
and I'm a little tanked.

10:06.871 --> 10:09.739
But... but they can
be a burden.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.877
Yeah, well, I don't think
she's all that interested.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.811
- Oh no? Hey, ladies.
- No, don't.

10:14.812 --> 10:18.682
- What are you two gossiping about?
- None of your business.

10:18.683 --> 10:20.951
- See?
- All right, all right.

10:20.952 --> 10:24.220
- It was so nice to meet you.
- It was so nice to meet you.

10:24.221 --> 10:26.157
- Thank you for dinner.
- Bye.

10:26.158 --> 10:28.426
Thanks for taking
such good care of us.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.195
<i>Good luck with your studies.
</i> My pleasure.

10:31.196 --> 10:34.065
Well, I hope
we meet again sometime.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.168
Me too.

10:37.168 --> 10:41.205
- Enjoy Rome.
- Oh. Well, we'll try.

10:41.206 --> 10:43.974
Thank you very much.
Good night, son.

10:43.975 --> 10:45.442
- Good night.
- Good night.

10:45.443 --> 10:46.982
Goodbye.

10:51.982 --> 10:54.819
<i>- What did you think?</i>
- She's very sweet.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.821
Wouldn't trust him
to mow my lawn.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.923
I thought he was...

10:59.924 --> 11:02.792
- Very interesting.
- Oh yeah?

11:02.793 --> 11:04.195
Well, that's 'cause
he couldn't keep

11:04.196 --> 11:06.997
- his eyes off you all night.
- No.

11:06.998 --> 11:09.266
Does he still
remind you of your father?

11:09.267 --> 11:14.071
He's a lot easier to talk to.

11:14.072 --> 11:17.176
Where are you taking us
on our last day?

11:18.176 --> 11:19.176
Sounion.

11:21.078 --> 11:23.918
Wish we were staying longer.

11:26.918 --> 11:30.956
Oh, she forgot her bracelet.

11:33.125 --> 11:35.158
Everything all right in there?

11:35.159 --> 11:36.996
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

11:38.996 --> 11:41.832
<i>Now we're talking.</i>

11:45.236 --> 11:48.274
Oh yeah.

11:55.246 --> 11:59.529
Come on. Get outta here.

12:10.529 --> 12:13.835
No thank you!

12:19.971 --> 12:22.306
Uh...<i> Parakalo.</i>

12:22.307 --> 12:24.175
Fuck off.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.578
Ah!

12:27.578 --> 12:30.880
<i>Just put
the "do not disturb" on.</i>

12:30.881 --> 12:32.115
No thank you.

12:32.116 --> 12:33.187
Mr. Donlevy?

12:36.187 --> 12:39.322
- No.
- Your name's not Donlevy?

12:39.323 --> 12:41.639
No. No no. I think you've
got the wrong room.

12:44.261 --> 12:46.038
How about Mr. McFarland?

12:53.038 --> 12:55.205
- Yes.
- May I come in?

12:55.206 --> 12:58.142
<i>Can I ask what this is about?</i>

12:58.143 --> 13:00.311
- Stock market.
- Canadian oil shares.

13:00.312 --> 13:02.178
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

13:02.179 --> 13:04.047
Hang on right here.
I'll just get

13:04.048 --> 13:05.983
my coat and we'll go downstairs.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.774
We can talk about it
right in here.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.122
No, let's just go to the bar.

13:12.123 --> 13:13.702
Right in there would be great.

13:17.995 --> 13:20.196
Sorry to barge in
on your like this, ma'am.

13:20.197 --> 13:22.409
<i>Okay.</i>

13:32.409 --> 13:34.411
Are you sure you don't
want me to wait?

13:34.412 --> 13:36.980
It's fine. You get back
to the hotel, all right?

13:36.981 --> 13:38.508
I'll call you in the morning.

13:39.017 --> 13:40.991
- Okay.
- Bye.

13:46.991 --> 13:52.963
You ran a brokerage firm called
Donlevy & Walters back in New York.

13:52.964 --> 13:54.130
That's right.

13:54.131 --> 13:55.237
You with the embassy?

13:57.101 --> 13:59.436
No.

13:59.437 --> 14:03.106
<i>I represent some
very unhappy clients</i>

14:03.107 --> 14:05.981
who invested
their money with you.

14:10.581 --> 14:13.249
You ought to be more careful
who you do business with.

14:13.250 --> 14:16.085
Listen, I'm sorry that
your clients are upset,

14:16.086 --> 14:18.122
but I can't help it
if the market crashes.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.393
This is a nice hotel.

14:21.393 --> 14:25.095
Just like all the other nice
hotels you've been staying at.

14:25.096 --> 14:28.412
<i>I've been following your trail all
across Europe, Mr. McFarland.</i>

14:29.000 --> 14:31.268
You've been throwing
a lot of cash around.

14:31.269 --> 14:34.475
- How long is the trip to Mycenae?
- A whole day, madam.

14:37.475 --> 14:39.979
<i>"Semper fi,"</i> huh?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.148
<i>You a marine?</i>

14:45.149 --> 14:47.383
No.
Infantry...

14:47.384 --> 14:50.387
-<i> army.</i>
- Yeah.

14:50.388 --> 14:52.455
It's funny, you know?

14:52.456 --> 14:55.492
<i>All that time over here
during the war,</i>

14:55.493 --> 14:58.128
I could give a shit
about Europe.

14:58.129 --> 14:59.998
Yet here I am again.

15:03.735 --> 15:05.004
Here's the deal:

15:06.004 --> 15:08.320
I could care less about
your other investors.

15:10.107 --> 15:12.176
You reimburse my clients,

15:12.177 --> 15:13.710
I'll go back home to my family

15:13.711 --> 15:16.080
and leave you
and your lovely wife alone.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.481
My wife has nothing
to do with this.

15:18.482 --> 15:22.720
Look, why don't
you and I go downstairs,

15:22.721 --> 15:24.488
have a drink,

15:24.489 --> 15:27.428
see if we can come
to an arrangement?

15:30.428 --> 15:33.323
Unfortunately, I'm not authorized
to negotiate with you.

15:35.232 --> 15:37.368
I'm just here for the money.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.538
Yeah.

15:40.538 --> 15:42.373
Okay, well,

15:42.374 --> 15:44.076
let me go and get it.

15:47.211 --> 15:49.147
Chester?

15:53.751 --> 15:56.355
-<i> Chester?</i>
- Don't come in!

15:57.355 --> 15:59.089
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.191
I need to return something
to some friends of mine,

16:01.192 --> 16:03.460
- the McFarlands.
- They're in room 505.

16:03.461 --> 16:05.495
505, okay.

16:05.496 --> 16:08.331
- Is there a phone I can use?
- The house phone is right over there.

16:08.332 --> 16:09.400
Ah, thank you.

16:30.054 --> 16:31.788
Don't answer it!
Don't answer it.

16:31.789 --> 16:34.524
- What's happening?
- He's fine. He fell.

16:34.525 --> 16:37.260
He hit his head pretty bad.
I've got to take him downstairs,

16:37.261 --> 16:39.396
get him some help.

16:39.397 --> 16:41.555
I thought you said
no one would follow us.

16:49.407 --> 16:51.311
Open the door!

16:53.311 --> 16:56.844
Get dressed, start packing. We've
gotta get out of here right away.

17:25.844 --> 17:27.444
Oh God.

17:32.116 --> 17:33.484
No.

17:53.337 --> 17:55.271
Can you, uh...
can you help me

17:55.272 --> 17:57.517
<i>get this guy's door open?</i>

18:05.517 --> 18:08.418
-<i> What happened?</i>
- He's hammered, that's what happened.

18:08.419 --> 18:10.488
I found him in the lobby.

18:16.928 --> 18:18.464
Good evening.

18:20.464 --> 18:21.464
Evening.

18:24.202 --> 18:26.672
Easy, like this.

18:27.672 --> 18:28.939
Oh Christ.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.606
- Is he okay?
- He'll be fine.

18:30.607 --> 18:34.210
He's gonna have an almighty
hangover tomorrow though.

18:34.211 --> 18:36.948
Who is he?

18:38.650 --> 18:41.386
I haven't the foggiest idea.

18:42.386 --> 18:44.453
Some drunk.

18:44.454 --> 18:47.658
He tried to paw Colette in the elevator,
then followed us to our room,

18:47.659 --> 18:50.265
<i>so I smacked him.</i>

18:54.265 --> 18:55.687
Let's let him sleep it off.

19:02.673 --> 19:04.644
Oh.

19:06.644 --> 19:09.278
Your wife left it in the cab.

19:09.279 --> 19:10.551
I was bringing it back.

19:14.551 --> 19:16.423
The truth is...

19:19.423 --> 19:21.225
I owe some people money.

19:21.226 --> 19:24.329
They sent him to
threaten us with a gun.

19:25.329 --> 19:27.532
Look.

19:28.532 --> 19:29.967
I don't know what to do.

19:29.968 --> 19:31.769
I mean, I...
I don't know...

19:32.769 --> 19:35.538
if he's alone or there's
somebody else in the lobby.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.803
All I know is we gotta
get out of this hotel

19:38.009 --> 19:40.248
before that man wakes up.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.758
Can you help us?

19:53.758 --> 19:55.645
Thank you.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.649
<i>Sorry, it's not the grand.</i>

20:19.017 --> 20:21.488
It's perfect.
It feels like New York.

20:23.488 --> 20:24.488
Oh, is that you?

20:26.023 --> 20:27.524
<i>Yeah, with my dad.</i>

20:27.525 --> 20:28.825
Is he back home?

20:28.826 --> 20:30.458
Uh, he passed away a month ago.

20:33.397 --> 20:34.740
I'm sorry.

20:49.780 --> 20:52.048
<i>So, uh, have you</i>

20:52.049 --> 20:53.749
<i>figured out who he is yet?</i>

20:53.750 --> 20:55.453
Private detective.

20:56.252 --> 20:57.621
<i>I got in trouble with a...</i>

20:57.622 --> 21:00.056
Gambling syndicate back home.

21:00.057 --> 21:02.459
<i>Made some investments for 'em</i>

21:02.460 --> 21:05.095
that didn't work out.

21:05.096 --> 21:07.065
Sent this guy after us.

21:08.865 --> 21:10.633
God knows who else.

21:10.634 --> 21:13.502
Well, the airport opens up
in a few hours.

21:13.503 --> 21:15.605
<i>You'll be gone
before the guy wakes up.</i>

21:16.874 --> 21:19.375
Hotel took our passports
when we checked in.

21:19.376 --> 21:21.846
- You don't have your passports?
-<i> Nope.</i>

21:22.503 --> 21:25.082
Well, I... I mean I can try
to go get 'em for you,

21:25.083 --> 21:26.963
<i>but I don't think
they're gonna give 'em to me.</i>

21:26.964 --> 21:28.785
Naw naw, it wouldn't
be safe anyway.

21:28.786 --> 21:30.824
Might be more of 'em
waiting for us.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.691
I don't know. I gotta
get Colette outta here.

21:35.692 --> 21:39.531
<i>We need new passports,
new identities.</i>

21:41.531 --> 21:44.633
I have a friend that I get
American cigarettes from.

21:44.634 --> 21:47.574
He might know somebody
that could help you out.

22:11.729 --> 22:13.396
You okay?

22:13.397 --> 22:14.936
No.

22:19.936 --> 22:22.173
He's gonna help us.

22:23.173 --> 22:25.541
We'll fly outta here soon.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.913
Where?

22:28.913 --> 22:30.151
We'll see.

22:33.151 --> 22:34.859
I'm sorry.

22:51.635 --> 22:53.906
<i>Chester?</i>

22:55.906 --> 22:57.980
<i>We should go.</i>

23:10.788 --> 23:13.656
Okay, my friend

23:13.657 --> 23:17.664
can arrange the new passports
for $1,000... each.

23:20.664 --> 23:22.531
So...

23:22.532 --> 23:24.934
Half now,

23:24.935 --> 23:26.671
half on delivery or...?

23:31.741 --> 23:33.943
- Niko...
- excuse me.

23:33.944 --> 23:36.813
When will the passports
be ready?

23:36.814 --> 23:38.781
Mmm, five days.

23:38.782 --> 23:40.483
- No no.
-<i> Maybe four.</i>

23:40.484 --> 23:42.487
We can't hang around
Athens that long.

23:52.829 --> 23:55.632
For another $1,000...

23:55.633 --> 23:57.701
He can deliver
the passports to Crete.

23:57.702 --> 23:59.970
- Crete?
-<i> Yeah, no one's gonna look for you there.</i>

23:59.971 --> 24:02.037
Well, that's...

24:02.038 --> 24:04.841
I mean, I don't know Crete
from a hole in the ground.

24:04.842 --> 24:07.778
Where am I gonna...

24:09.513 --> 24:11.981
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
What did he say?

24:11.982 --> 24:13.062
What's the matter?
No no no.

24:13.063 --> 24:14.985
I should come with you.

24:14.986 --> 24:16.920
- What?
-<i> I should come with you.</i>

24:16.921 --> 24:19.556
- No no no.
- You're not gonna know your way around.

24:19.557 --> 24:20.594
I can go with you.

24:23.594 --> 24:24.830
You would do that?

24:26.830 --> 24:28.632
Yes.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.534
I'd certainly make it
worth your while.

24:30.535 --> 24:32.568
It's okay, it's...
it's not about the money.

24:32.569 --> 24:34.304
No, I know, but you deserve...

24:34.305 --> 24:36.674
<i>you have to pay him
another $500.</i>

24:37.674 --> 24:40.279
<i>500...
so 1500 more?</i>

24:42.279 --> 24:43.297
Yeah.

24:59.297 --> 25:01.455
Did you give him
any money for the drinks?

25:03.099 --> 25:04.099
I offered.

25:05.001 --> 25:06.835
Well, you should have insisted.

25:06.836 --> 25:08.837
He's probably
too proud to accept.

25:08.838 --> 25:12.911
Trust me, he's doing fine.

25:13.911 --> 25:15.578
What's that supposed to mean?

25:15.579 --> 25:17.780
It means he already
skimmed his commission.

25:17.781 --> 25:19.729
Why else do you think
he's helping us?

25:20.017 --> 25:21.884
I'm sure it's not
just the money.

25:21.885 --> 25:23.987
No?

25:23.988 --> 25:26.791
I think he's also
got a thing for you.

25:27.791 --> 25:29.692
Either way, we need him...

25:29.693 --> 25:32.095
At least for a few more days.

25:32.096 --> 25:34.931
- Hey, buddy.
- Coffee's cold and the beer's warm.

25:34.932 --> 25:36.836
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

25:39.436 --> 25:41.805
- Thanks.
- Anything interesting in the newspaper?

25:41.806 --> 25:44.438
Greeks and Turks are at
each other's throats again.

26:02.708 --> 26:04.393
Hey, honey, do you mind going in

26:04.394 --> 26:06.699
and seeing what's
taking him so long?

26:08.699 --> 26:09.699
Please?

26:39.130 --> 26:42.731
<i>What gives?</i> Well, we can't check
in without all three passports.

26:42.732 --> 26:44.701
- Why not?
- It's a legal requirement.

26:44.702 --> 26:46.702
Apparently, it's the same
everywhere in Iraklion.

26:46.703 --> 26:47.970
But if we go to a smaller town,

26:47.971 --> 26:50.406
they might be more
relaxed about the rules.

26:50.407 --> 26:52.842
- Where'd you have in mind?
- Chania.

26:52.843 --> 26:54.743
It's up the coast
and there's a bus

26:54.744 --> 26:56.712
that leaves first thing
in the morning.

26:56.713 --> 26:57.815
- In the morning?
- Yeah.

26:58.015 --> 27:01.451
We could stay up.
It's warm enough.

27:01.452 --> 27:03.400
And you can leave
your suitcases here.

27:04.020 --> 27:05.922
Uh, no.

27:05.923 --> 27:07.698
<i>I think I'll hang on to them.</i>

27:13.698 --> 27:16.132
My father almost
had a heart attack

27:16.133 --> 27:19.868
when I left home. He said, "New
York has turned its back on God."

27:19.869 --> 27:22.439
"And you should be
very careful, young lady."

27:22.440 --> 27:24.443
Oh lord.

27:26.443 --> 27:29.112
Taverna Asterion...
what is "Asterion"?

27:29.113 --> 27:31.448
Asterius is a minotaur.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.219
So Asterion would have been...

27:35.219 --> 27:37.053
Grandfather.

27:37.054 --> 27:39.922
Actually, it's the same name.
Asterius, Asterion...

27:39.923 --> 27:42.791
it's just a different pronunciation.
It means the same thing.

27:42.792 --> 27:44.993
-<i> But it is confusing.</i>
- Mmm.

27:44.994 --> 27:46.098
Who knew?

27:48.098 --> 27:51.034
- Where did you live?
- On Hudson and 11th.

27:51.035 --> 27:53.068
<i>I shared an apartment
with three Barnard...</i>

27:53.069 --> 27:55.838
I'm fading. I don't know if
I can stay up much longer.

27:55.839 --> 27:58.911
Well, order some coffee.

28:00.911 --> 28:02.859
I think I'm gonna have
another scotch.

28:06.182 --> 28:07.814
So how did the two of you meet?

28:09.487 --> 28:12.489
<i>I crashed one of his
parties with a girlfriend.</i>

28:12.490 --> 28:14.223
It was like nothing
I'd ever seen.

28:14.224 --> 28:17.160
There was champagne and caviar

28:17.161 --> 28:19.162
and millionaires everywhere.

28:19.163 --> 28:20.865
Garcon!

28:21.634 --> 28:23.266
May I have a cigarette, please?

28:23.267 --> 28:24.770
Whiskey.

28:26.770 --> 28:28.839
And a whiskey.

28:29.839 --> 28:31.007
<i>Thank you.</i>

28:31.008 --> 28:32.061
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

28:34.044 --> 28:35.314
You must be awfully...

28:37.314 --> 28:39.982
Good at languages to pick
up Greek so quickly.

28:39.983 --> 28:42.085
I had a head start.
My father

28:42.086 --> 28:44.220
made me and my sisters
learn different languages

28:44.221 --> 28:46.055
since we could
practically speak,

28:46.056 --> 28:48.324
so every month it would
be a different language...

28:48.325 --> 28:50.093
French and then Italian,

28:50.094 --> 28:52.060
- then Russian.
- Russian?

28:52.061 --> 28:54.530
Can I keep the bottle?

28:54.531 --> 28:57.133
<i>And the thing is when he'd
overhear us speaking English</i>

28:57.134 --> 29:00.103
we'd get demerits. There was
this chart in the hall.

29:00.104 --> 29:02.874
Even my poor mother would
get on it now and then.

29:03.874 --> 29:05.348
And what did your father do?

29:08.011 --> 29:11.047
He was a Professor
of archeology at Harvard.

29:11.048 --> 29:12.548
- Wow.
- Yeah.

29:12.549 --> 29:14.217
He certainly thought so.

29:14.218 --> 29:15.288
And you don't?

29:18.288 --> 29:21.257
Listen, my old man drove
a truck for a living.

29:21.258 --> 29:24.259
He didn't teach us very good
English, never mind French

29:24.260 --> 29:26.998
<i>or Russian.</i>

29:27.998 --> 29:30.066
Impressive.

29:30.067 --> 29:31.904
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:33.904 --> 29:35.238
It is.

29:35.239 --> 29:36.239
I'd like to dance.

29:37.007 --> 29:38.908
Okay, yeah, all right.

29:38.909 --> 29:40.876
May I finish my scotch first?

29:40.877 --> 29:42.312
Rydal?

29:42.313 --> 29:43.317
Uh...

29:46.317 --> 29:47.317
Knock yourself out.

30:26.056 --> 30:28.091
Are you all right?

30:28.092 --> 30:29.659
Yeah.

30:29.660 --> 30:31.187
- Let me help you.
- I got it!

30:39.002 --> 30:40.105
Honey... honey!

30:42.105 --> 30:44.207
I just want to sit here

30:44.208 --> 30:47.242
- and finish my cigarette.
- Are you sure you're all right?

30:47.243 --> 30:49.916
Stop asking me that!

30:52.916 --> 30:55.084
The bus leaves in a few hours.

30:55.085 --> 30:56.251
We'll just...

30:56.252 --> 30:58.354
Have to hang in there.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.038
Go ahead, I'll catch up.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.139
- Hey, I hope that...
- you know what?

31:16.140 --> 31:18.441
Just run along, Rydal.

31:18.442 --> 31:20.250
<i>Run along.</i>

31:35.025 --> 31:36.710
I bet you wish you never met us.

31:37.027 --> 31:39.295
No.

31:39.296 --> 31:40.296
No, I'm glad I did.

31:51.107 --> 31:52.711
<i>He's mad at himself.</i>

31:53.711 --> 31:55.315
Not you.

32:06.323 --> 32:08.125
Shit.

32:14.530 --> 32:16.242
Oh.

33:28.505 --> 33:30.806
Uh,<i> kafe parakalo.</i>

33:30.807 --> 33:32.374
Kafe?

33:32.375 --> 33:33.811
And, uh...

33:34.811 --> 33:36.144
One of them.

33:36.145 --> 33:37.814
- Donut?
- Donut.

33:37.815 --> 33:39.304
Yeah, donut.

34:00.304 --> 34:02.175
Morning.

34:08.244 --> 34:11.550
I brought you a Greek donut.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.126
Thanks.

34:22.126 --> 34:23.364
It's good.

34:29.364 --> 34:31.399
<i>I heard the sea when I woke up</i>

34:31.400 --> 34:34.558
<i>and I thought we were back at
the beach house on long island.</i>

34:38.641 --> 34:40.641
Hey.

34:40.643 --> 34:42.678
When we get our new passports,

34:42.679 --> 34:45.880
<i>I'll straighten things out
with those guys in New York.</i>

34:45.882 --> 34:48.216
We'll be home soon.

34:48.217 --> 34:49.685
<i>Morning.</i>

34:49.686 --> 34:51.453
- Morning.
- Ahem.

34:51.454 --> 34:54.456
Oh whew.
We should get going

34:54.458 --> 34:56.217
if we're gonna catch the bus.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.399
- Thanks.
- Hey, Rydal?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.334
How long are we stopping here?

35:39.335 --> 35:42.546
I don't know. It depends how long
the bus driver takes to eat.

35:51.648 --> 35:54.317
Can I get you something?

35:54.318 --> 35:55.588
Uh...

35:57.588 --> 36:00.288
Yeah, a beer'd be nice.

36:00.289 --> 36:01.756
Okay.
I got it.

36:01.757 --> 36:03.459
Hey, Rydal?

36:03.460 --> 36:04.460
Uh...

36:07.364 --> 36:10.302
I want to apologize for last night.
I was out of line.

36:12.302 --> 36:15.706
Colette told me your dad passed
away recently. I didn't know.

36:16.706 --> 36:18.286
I'm sorry.

37:56.806 --> 37:59.442
<i>He died.
It's all over the news.</i>

37:59.443 --> 38:02.511
You have to turn yourself in.
It was self-defense.

38:02.512 --> 38:04.516
They mention any suspects?

38:06.314 --> 38:08.683
No, but they have...
they have your passports.

38:08.684 --> 38:11.453
It's just a matter of time.
If you turn yourself in...

38:11.454 --> 38:13.891
they'll arrest you
as an accomplice.

38:15.891 --> 38:19.562
Witnesses saw both of us with
the body in the hotel hallway.

38:19.563 --> 38:21.763
You arranged
fake passports for us.

38:21.764 --> 38:23.866
- No no no.
- You accompanied us to Crete.

38:23.867 --> 38:27.703
And now you're carrying what? An extra
$1,000 of my money in your pocket?

38:27.704 --> 38:29.538
I'm trying to help you.

38:29.539 --> 38:31.707
I know.

38:31.708 --> 38:33.808
I know you are.

38:33.809 --> 38:35.382
Did you know he was dead?

38:40.483 --> 38:42.118
Colette doesn't.

38:42.119 --> 38:44.014
I'd prefer it
if she didn't find out.

39:12.748 --> 39:15.853
I'm finally in a good mood
and now you two are sulking.

39:16.853 --> 39:18.889
<i>What's the matter?</i>

39:19.889 --> 39:23.197
- I'm just a little tired.
- I bet I can make you laugh.

39:36.654 --> 39:38.707
Oh, finish your O-Zo
and I'll try again.

39:38.708 --> 39:40.176
It's "ouzo."

39:40.177 --> 39:42.645
O-u-z-o.
Four letters.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.916
Well, it tastes like
gasoline to me.

39:46.677 --> 39:48.783
Hey, you want to share
some oysters, hon?

39:48.784 --> 39:51.453
The guidebook says it's a bad
idea to eat shellfish here.

39:51.454 --> 39:53.855
The Greeks have only been doing
it for thousands of years,

39:53.856 --> 39:56.792
but I'm sure your parochial
guidebook's probably right.

39:56.793 --> 40:00.663
Better to eat shellfish
from some dirty New York kitchen

40:00.664 --> 40:02.797
than right here by the sea where
it's caught in front of your eyes.

40:02.798 --> 40:04.899
- I wish I was in New York right now.
- Oh, skip it.

40:04.900 --> 40:06.803
Of course we can't
go back to New York.

40:07.003 --> 40:09.538
We can't go anywhere in the states
because Chester's business ventures

40:09.539 --> 40:11.674
- have been such a huge success.
- There's three of us here at the table.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.035
I'm sure Rydal doesn't
want to hear

40:13.036 --> 40:14.509
you whine about
how homesick you are.

40:14.510 --> 40:15.950
All right, why don't you
lay off her?

40:15.951 --> 40:18.848
Who, my wife?

40:18.849 --> 40:21.018
- Don't rise to it.
- No, let him.

40:22.018 --> 40:23.597
Let's hear what's on his mind.

40:34.231 --> 40:36.698
Don't you ever speak
to me like that again.

40:36.699 --> 40:37.699
Or what?

40:47.610 --> 40:49.245
Are we gonna talk about this?

40:49.246 --> 40:52.987
We had an argument.
There's nothing to talk about.

40:56.987 --> 40:58.989
Are you sure?

40:59.989 --> 41:02.561
Is there gonna be another
black mark against me?

41:08.197 --> 41:10.799
Look, I got upset because
I don't like you discussing

41:10.800 --> 41:13.067
my business in front of him.
He could use it against us.

41:13.068 --> 41:15.037
Oh.
That's ridiculous.

41:15.038 --> 41:18.943
Is it? He's done
nothing but lie to us.

41:19.893 --> 41:22.578
I mean do you believe any
of that Harvard Yale crap?

41:22.579 --> 41:23.632
I don't really care.

41:24.014 --> 41:26.717
It's not like we've been
straight with him.

41:27.449 --> 41:28.818
Why are you defending him?

41:29.018 --> 41:31.690
Because I like him.

41:33.690 --> 41:36.297
And I appreciate
what he's doing for us.

41:40.297 --> 41:42.699
You like him.

41:43.699 --> 41:46.304
I didn't mean it like that.

42:28.844 --> 42:30.145
<i>Nai?</i>

42:30.146 --> 42:31.684
<i>It's me.</i>

42:34.684 --> 42:36.619
One second.

42:45.661 --> 42:47.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

42:47.630 --> 42:49.098
Just thought I'd take a walk,

42:49.099 --> 42:51.133
but I don't know what there is
to see in this town.

42:51.134 --> 42:53.702
Uh, ruins.

42:56.773 --> 42:58.707
Your room's smaller than ours.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.235
Well, there's only one of me.

43:01.010 --> 43:02.977
Anything interesting happening

43:02.978 --> 43:05.046
- in the outside world?
- Uh...

43:05.047 --> 43:07.783
Soccer.

43:07.784 --> 43:09.984
- Where's Chester?
-<i> Oh, he was up all night.</i>

43:09.985 --> 43:12.889
He's taken a sleeping pill.

43:13.889 --> 43:15.056
Hmm.

43:15.057 --> 43:17.725
You keep a diary?

43:17.726 --> 43:20.395
Yeah, it's just
notes for my work.

43:20.396 --> 43:22.967
Anything about me and Chester?

43:23.967 --> 43:26.414
Maybe there's a line or two.

43:37.414 --> 43:39.150
You coming with me?

43:43.719 --> 43:45.888
For a walk.

43:45.889 --> 43:48.226
Sure, yeah, I'll come with you.

43:51.226 --> 43:53.701
Good.

44:03.873 --> 44:05.719
Sweetie?

45:34.864 --> 45:37.799
Uh, excuse me.

45:37.800 --> 45:39.567
I have no idea where I am.

45:39.568 --> 45:42.203
I, uh...
how do I get downtown?

45:42.204 --> 45:45.140
<i>Kentro... Citta?</i>

45:45.141 --> 45:47.181
You know,
where the people gather?

45:51.181 --> 45:52.547
Whiskey?

45:52.548 --> 45:53.548
Whiskey.

46:01.157 --> 46:03.477
Tell the driver that
I just want to drive around.

46:03.478 --> 46:04.892
- I'm looking for my wife.
- Okay.

46:04.893 --> 46:06.227
Wife, sure, yes.

46:06.228 --> 46:08.163
- Go inside.
- Okay.

46:08.164 --> 46:09.897
Oh, my friend, you pay first.

46:09.898 --> 46:11.600
- Pay first?
- Yes!

46:11.601 --> 46:13.868
- How much is it?
- I show you, I show you, I show you.

46:13.869 --> 46:16.305
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going?

46:16.306 --> 46:18.426
- I don't know where I'm going. Just tell him...
- 50.

46:18.427 --> 46:20.576
50 yeah, okay.
Thanks.

46:20.577 --> 46:22.858
- Go inside.
- You understand I just want to drive around?

46:22.859 --> 46:24.175
Good luck with your wife.

46:30.286 --> 46:32.321
Hang on, stop stop
stop stop stop.

46:32.322 --> 46:33.322
Stop stop.

46:39.195 --> 46:42.064
Colette!

46:42.065 --> 46:44.603
Colette!

46:46.603 --> 46:49.104
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:49.105 --> 46:50.407
Hey!

46:52.407 --> 46:54.279
Son of a bitch!

47:01.050 --> 47:03.186
He punched me, he punched me!

47:04.186 --> 47:06.622
Stop, stop stop,
the cops are here.

47:06.623 --> 47:08.362
Go.
Get out of here!

47:16.274 --> 47:17.801
Ah, he just
sucker-punched me.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.433
Shh, come on, shh, come on.

47:19.434 --> 47:21.314
- Where the hell were you, anyway?
- Be careful.

47:21.315 --> 47:23.638
- Where have you guys been?
- Shh, please please calm down.

47:23.639 --> 47:25.339
- Did you sleep with him?
- Shh. No.

47:25.340 --> 47:27.442
You see what he's doing?
He's trying to tear us apart

47:27.443 --> 47:29.444
- this whole trip!
- No! Calm down.

47:29.445 --> 47:32.247
He told you, didn't he?
Did he tell you?

47:32.248 --> 47:34.316
- What are you talking about?
- He was...

47:34.317 --> 47:36.951
- told me what?
- The guy hit his head!

47:36.952 --> 47:39.690
All right? He had a gun,
what am I supposed to do?

47:40.690 --> 47:43.638
I was trying to protect you.
I was trying to protect you.

47:45.295 --> 47:47.664
Forget it.
Forget it.

48:11.186 --> 48:12.687
Why didn't you tell me?

48:12.688 --> 48:14.422
He asked me not to say anything.

48:14.423 --> 48:17.494
- He thought that you would panic.
- He killed someone!

48:18.494 --> 48:20.294
Why would you lie for him?

48:20.295 --> 48:22.268
I didn't do it for him.

48:25.268 --> 48:27.744
You shouldn't have done it
for either of us.

48:34.744 --> 48:37.715
Those people that are after
him... what did he do?

48:39.715 --> 48:41.452
He swindled them.

48:43.452 --> 48:46.242
<i>He sold them shares in an oil
field that didn't exist.</i>

48:49.025 --> 48:51.728
<i>Them and hundreds
of other people.</i>

48:52.728 --> 48:54.199
How much did you know?

48:56.199 --> 48:58.210
He's my husband.

49:07.210 --> 49:09.210
I'll call my friend
in the morning,

49:09.211 --> 49:11.248
see if your passports are ready.

49:12.248 --> 49:13.751
<i>Then what?</i>

49:14.751 --> 49:18.053
Hide some place else?
Change our names?

49:18.054 --> 49:20.190
I can't live like that anymore.

49:22.190 --> 49:23.559
<i>What do you want me to do?</i>

49:25.460 --> 49:27.498
<i>I just wanna go home.</i>

49:40.809 --> 49:43.284
I didn't know.

49:49.284 --> 49:50.788
...Niko.

49:56.291 --> 49:58.259
I think it's better
if you and Colette

49:58.260 --> 49:59.593
don't sit next to each other.

49:59.594 --> 50:02.129
Why don't you and I
sit together?

50:02.130 --> 50:04.108
Do you mind, sweetie?

51:41.197 --> 51:43.666
- Oh shit.
- What?

51:44.666 --> 51:45.666
Hey.

51:50.606 --> 51:52.481
Oh, for Pete's sake.

51:59.481 --> 52:00.515
Hey!

52:00.516 --> 52:02.716
Hey!

52:02.717 --> 52:05.520
- What the hell's going on?
- She thinks they recognized her.

52:05.521 --> 52:07.355
Nobody recognized you.

52:07.356 --> 52:09.723
- She says they recognized her.
- Get back on the bus!

52:09.724 --> 52:12.928
- No! Get your hands off of me!
- Let's go! Get back on the fucking bus!

52:12.929 --> 52:15.699
This is all your fault!
Don't blame me.

52:16.699 --> 52:18.536
- Listen here...
- okay.

52:38.721 --> 52:41.423
- I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

53:49.557 --> 53:51.359
You should get some rest.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.360
You get some rest.

53:54.063 --> 53:55.382
I'm fine.

54:14.382 --> 54:16.065
I'm gonna have a look around.

54:50.686 --> 54:52.887
Hey! Wake up.
Let's go.

54:56.559 --> 54:59.526
Come on, wake up, sweetie.
Let's go.

54:59.527 --> 55:01.738
Let's get you out of the rain.
We gotta go.

55:31.726 --> 55:33.627
Thanks.

55:33.628 --> 55:35.629
I'm gonna go see if there's
somewhere we can rest.

55:35.630 --> 55:37.894
I'll be right back.

56:05.894 --> 56:09.464
Colette.

56:09.465 --> 56:12.933
Chester?

56:12.934 --> 56:16.604
- Chester!
- I'm gonna go look for him, okay?

56:16.605 --> 56:19.195
Stay here.

56:40.195 --> 56:41.871
<i>Chester?</i>

56:49.871 --> 56:51.539
Chester?

57:43.726 --> 57:46.864
Rydal?

57:52.867 --> 57:54.940
Did you find him?

57:57.940 --> 58:01.743
- Where's Rydal?
- Forget about Rydal.

58:01.744 --> 58:03.713
What have you done to him?

58:04.713 --> 58:06.281
Nothing.

58:06.282 --> 58:07.681
Come on, let's go.

58:07.682 --> 58:10.285
- Tell me.
- He's fine!

58:10.286 --> 58:12.854
- Where is he?
- We don't need him.

58:12.855 --> 58:15.290
Look, I'm sorry.
I know I screwed up.

58:15.291 --> 58:17.792
I'll make it up to you.
We can start over.

58:17.793 --> 58:19.694
- It's too late.
- Don't say that!

58:19.695 --> 58:21.563
God!

58:23.032 --> 58:24.032
Colette!

58:56.331 --> 58:58.732
Oh. Oh no.

58:58.733 --> 59:01.669
No. No. No.

59:01.670 --> 59:04.372
No. No no! God, no!

59:04.373 --> 59:05.974
No! No! No!

59:09.677 --> 59:11.813
Oh no. No.

59:59.795 --> 01:00:00.795
Where's Rydal?

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:04.668
He ran away with my wife.

01:00:06.668 --> 01:00:08.007
You got my passport?

01:00:16.844 --> 01:00:19.989
Another 2500, like we agreed.

01:00:33.195 --> 01:00:36.032
- You see the newspapers?
- Mm-hmm.

01:00:37.032 --> 01:00:39.067
Could be a problem for me.

01:00:39.068 --> 01:00:40.068
Yeah.

01:00:43.038 --> 01:00:46.184
But a much bigger problem
if I get caught.

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.253
Oh God.

01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:14.308
The truth is
we're joined at the hip.

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:17.178
I get caught, I take you down.

01:05:17.179 --> 01:05:20.180
You get caught, you turn me in.

01:05:20.181 --> 01:05:23.750
<i>Guess you must've thought of that
or you would've gone to the cops.</i>

01:05:23.751 --> 01:05:26.123
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

01:05:27.723 --> 01:05:29.923
I know you wouldn't be here
if you didn't have

01:05:29.924 --> 01:05:32.192
a little larceny in your veins.

01:05:32.193 --> 01:05:34.261
How much do you want?

01:05:34.262 --> 01:05:36.062
I don't know.
You were married to her.

01:05:36.063 --> 01:05:37.906
How much do you think
she was worth?

01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.774
I'll give you $5,000.

01:05:47.775 --> 01:05:51.757
Oh, I bet you have a lot more
than that in your suitcase.

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.061
10,000.
That's it.

01:06:06.061 --> 01:06:07.463
I don't want your money.

01:06:09.463 --> 01:06:11.367
I wanted your wife.

01:06:22.476 --> 01:06:27.119
Don't you ever mention
my wife again!

01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:49.570
Whoo.

01:08:44.484 --> 01:08:46.256
Hmm?

01:08:50.256 --> 01:08:52.529
Over there? Okay okay.

01:08:54.529 --> 01:08:56.430
Shit.

01:09:24.524 --> 01:09:25.524
Oh.

01:09:29.264 --> 01:09:31.368
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:36.636
You live in Crete?

01:09:36.636 --> 01:09:38.639
No, I'm an American.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:40.711
Traveling alone?

01:09:42.711 --> 01:09:45.782
Uh, no.
No no, I'm...

01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:55.689
<i>Hey!</i>

01:10:10.738 --> 01:10:13.506
- Yes?
- Is this your son?

01:10:13.507 --> 01:10:15.011
Uh, well...

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.414
Dad, he wants to know
if I'm traveling alone.

01:10:20.414 --> 01:10:22.416
Yes sir. I...

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:25.391
we were just in separate lines.

01:10:30.391 --> 01:10:31.831
Is there a problem?

01:10:36.831 --> 01:10:38.666
No, you can go.

01:10:38.667 --> 01:10:40.501
Thank you.

01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:42.639
Thank you, sir.

01:10:44.639 --> 01:10:47.073
Don't do anything stupid.

01:10:47.074 --> 01:10:49.380
Get your hands off me.

01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:54.047
Now what?

01:10:54.048 --> 01:10:56.720
- I'm going to the airport.
- Me too.

01:11:15.448 --> 01:11:16.870
<i>Are they talking about her?</i>

01:11:16.871 --> 01:11:18.578
- What are they saying?
- Shh!

01:11:23.578 --> 01:11:25.679
They think she was robbed.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:28.782
They didn't find
anything on her.

01:11:28.783 --> 01:11:31.757
What else?

01:11:36.757 --> 01:11:38.547
Who are they describing,
you or me?

01:12:13.661 --> 01:12:15.466
- Do you speak English?
- Yes sir.

01:12:18.466 --> 01:12:20.134
- What's your name?
- Kynthia.

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:23.438
Kynthia?
Very nice.

01:12:25.472 --> 01:12:27.608
Bobby, Bobby Weidican.

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:29.410
We, uh...

01:12:29.411 --> 01:12:31.879
we'd like two seats
on the Frankfurt flight.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.480
Let me check, sir.

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:46.260
Go sit down and I'll take
care of the tickets.

01:12:46.927 --> 01:12:48.170
Give me your passport.

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.679
Just a second, sir.

01:13:37.679 --> 01:13:39.679
Frankfurt, huh?

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.854
Yeah, didn't your old man
teach you German?

01:13:45.854 --> 01:13:48.988
You know, I saw a picture
of you with your father

01:13:48.989 --> 01:13:50.927
in your little poem book.

01:13:53.927 --> 01:13:55.996
Looked like he cared
a lot about you.

01:13:55.997 --> 01:13:57.801
Looks can be deceiving.

01:13:59.801 --> 01:14:03.939
Oh yeah.

01:14:05.939 --> 01:14:08.844
Why didn't you go
to his funeral?

01:14:09.844 --> 01:14:11.897
'Cause he wouldn't
have wanted me there.

01:14:15.015 --> 01:14:16.849
The problem is

01:14:16.850 --> 01:14:19.719
we expect too much from them.

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.924
When I was a kid, I looked up
at my father like he was a God.

01:14:23.925 --> 01:14:25.027
Then you grow up...

01:14:26.027 --> 01:14:29.698
And they disappoint you
a little more every day.

01:14:35.770 --> 01:14:37.603
Where are you going?

01:14:37.604 --> 01:14:41.541
I'm gonna get a drink.
You want something?

01:14:41.542 --> 01:14:43.761
- Coffee?
- No.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:25.978
<i>Welcome aboard
flight OA 180 to Istanbul.</i>

01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:28.982
<i>Our captain has informed me
that our flight time will be</i>

01:16:28.983 --> 01:16:32.788
<i>approximately
one hour and 30 minutes.</i>

01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:35.252
<i>Guess you should've killed me
when you had the chance?</i>

01:17:38.252 --> 01:17:41.455
- Where are you calling from?
-<i> Oh, right across the bridge.</i>

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.756
How'd you find me?

01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:45.892
<i>I asked the girl
at the ticket counter.</i>

01:17:45.893 --> 01:17:49.496
<i>Kynthia, wasn't it?</i>

01:17:49.497 --> 01:17:53.037
<i>Then I called every hotel in town, Mr.
Weidican.</i>

01:17:56.037 --> 01:17:57.504
<i>I want the money...</i>

01:17:57.505 --> 01:17:59.773
<i>all of it...</i>

01:17:59.774 --> 01:18:01.907
<i>or I'm gonna give your new
identity to the feds.</i>

01:18:01.908 --> 01:18:03.809
Listen, why don't you come over

01:18:03.810 --> 01:18:05.812
and we can have
a drink and talk about it.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:09.081
<i>I don't think so.
CafÃ© sultan,</i>

01:18:09.082 --> 01:18:11.240
<i>jewelry quarter,
grand bazaar, 20 minutes.</i>

01:18:12.019 --> 01:18:15.122
<i>You shouldn't have tried
to frame me for her murder.</i>

01:18:26.067 --> 01:18:27.752
We're gonna need a confession...

01:18:29.237 --> 01:18:31.202
- Or the deal's off.
- Yeah, I know.

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:36.569
You want something to drink?

01:19:36.570 --> 01:19:38.573
I'm afraid
they don't serve alcohol.

01:19:40.207 --> 01:19:43.377
I'll have whatever
you're having.

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.538
I see your old man
taught you Turkish too.

01:19:51.118 --> 01:19:53.053
You might find
this hard to believe,

01:19:53.054 --> 01:19:54.423
but I missed your company.

01:19:54.836 --> 01:19:56.889
You're the only person
left in the world

01:19:56.890 --> 01:19:58.890
I can have an honest
conversation with.

01:20:01.194 --> 01:20:05.197
- You have it on you?
- Mm-hmm.

01:20:05.198 --> 01:20:07.300
10,000.
It's all I have.

01:20:07.301 --> 01:20:08.354
No, 10,000 won't do.

01:20:12.873 --> 01:20:15.274
You should be paying me.
When we first met,

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:17.376
you were shortchanging
college girls.

01:20:17.377 --> 01:20:21.081
Now look at you...
a real criminal.

01:20:21.082 --> 01:20:22.661
There's something else I want.

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.408
I want a picture of Colette.

01:20:48.408 --> 01:20:50.645
Take your pick.

01:20:58.085 --> 01:20:59.954
Was that even her real name?

01:21:00.954 --> 01:21:01.954
Colette?

01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:08.127
Why'd you try and frame me?

01:21:08.128 --> 01:21:09.931
Do you really have to ask?

01:21:10.931 --> 01:21:12.469
Because she liked me?

01:21:15.469 --> 01:21:17.176
You know I slept with her.

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:23.247
She wanted me to.

01:21:27.247 --> 01:21:29.114
She wanted a way out.

01:21:29.115 --> 01:21:30.716
That's all you meant to her...

01:21:30.717 --> 01:21:32.285
some callow kid

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:33.687
she would've forgotten
in a minute.

01:21:33.688 --> 01:21:35.354
Then why did you kill her?

01:21:35.355 --> 01:21:37.359
She was the one thing
I cared about.

01:21:38.359 --> 01:21:39.993
Now why would I kill her?

01:21:43.298 --> 01:21:45.800
I don't expect you to
understand now, but one day

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:48.200
you're gonna wake up and you're
gonna look in the mirror

01:21:48.201 --> 01:21:51.623
and you're gonna see someone who's
not all that different from me.

01:21:53.039 --> 01:21:55.709
And you're gonna realize
that every hope and dream

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.243
you ever had has slipped
through your fingers.

01:21:58.244 --> 01:22:01.180
And all you've got,
if you're lucky,

01:22:01.181 --> 01:22:03.183
is someone like her.

01:22:03.184 --> 01:22:05.720
That's what you took from me.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:08.721
That's what I took from you?

01:22:08.722 --> 01:22:11.326
You tried to kill me.

01:22:12.326 --> 01:22:14.193
And you killed her.

01:22:14.194 --> 01:22:15.194
Admit it.

01:22:20.134 --> 01:22:21.760
Admit it.

01:22:50.264 --> 01:22:54.555
Let's go for a walk. I don't
wanna give you the money here.

01:23:15.555 --> 01:23:18.127
Welcome, sir.

01:23:20.127 --> 01:23:21.262
Hello.

01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:25.712
Oh shit.

01:26:55.609 --> 01:26:57.582
Oh shit.

01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:04.349
No, wait wait. No.
Let me talk to him.

01:27:04.350 --> 01:27:06.386
Let me talk to him!

01:27:37.618 --> 01:27:40.524
You wearing a wire?

01:27:49.796 --> 01:27:51.399
<i>My name...</i>

01:27:52.399 --> 01:27:54.403
Is Chester McFarland.

01:27:56.403 --> 01:27:58.470
<i>I'm guilty of fraud,</i>

01:27:58.471 --> 01:28:02.644
<i>ruining the lives of many men.</i>

01:28:03.644 --> 01:28:05.847
I'm responsible...

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:11.122
For the death
of a private detective...

01:28:16.122 --> 01:28:18.592
And the death of my wife.

01:28:22.128 --> 01:28:24.899
Rydal keener...

01:28:25.899 --> 01:28:27.505
Had nothing to do with it.

01:28:31.505 --> 01:28:32.505
I framed him.

01:28:44.118 --> 01:28:47.923
Sorry I disappointed you.

01:29:22.756 --> 01:29:26.194
Our embassy will arrange
for your repatriation.

01:29:28.194 --> 01:29:29.500
You're free to go home.

01:29:33.500 --> 01:29:35.768
Where will he be buried?

01:29:35.769 --> 01:29:38.638
We haven't been able
to trace any next of kin,

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:40.540
so he'll be buried here.

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:41.778
Why?

01:29:44.778 --> 01:29:46.515
Thought I'd go to his funeral.
