00:57.458 --> 00:59.293
Sticking your head

01:01.829 --> 01:02.830
It might.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.366
Besides,

01:05.433 --> 01:07.735
New York needs to see me coming.

01:15.643 --> 01:16.977

01:17.044 --> 01:18.912
Isn't there room
at the church for this?

01:18.979 --> 01:20.181
Then Tilde could help.

01:32.793 --> 01:36.364
Zelda, there's something
we need to discuss,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.432
something Mama explained to me

01:38.499 --> 01:40.234
before my wedding night

01:40.301 --> 01:42.470
and I had to explain to Tilde.

01:42.536 --> 01:43.837
Oh?

01:45.239 --> 01:46.674
About your...

01:48.976 --> 01:50.878
About your conjugal duties.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.012
My what?

01:52.079 --> 01:53.447
Baby,

01:53.514 --> 01:56.517
every man has his own
set of expectations,

01:56.584 --> 02:00.754
but it's better to
perform them in the dark.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.190
The darker, the better.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.193
Not that there's
any need to worry.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.594
He'll take the lead, of course,

02:06.660 --> 02:11.699
but it's important
for a wife not to...

02:13.801 --> 02:14.868
hesitate.

02:14.935 --> 02:18.206
So when your husband is...

02:18.239 --> 02:20.474
ready to...

02:21.609 --> 02:22.610
proceed,

02:22.676 --> 02:24.578
you just lie back

02:24.645 --> 02:28.782

in our garden.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.584

11:57.184 --> 11:58.786
- [laughter]
- Prettier than I am?

11:58.819 --> 12:01.054
I was as pretty as you are,

12:01.121 --> 12:02.655
and you're as handsome as me.

12:02.790 --> 12:03.957
We're two of a kind.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.425
Yes, although only one of you

12:05.492 --> 12:08.095
was propositioned by a pair
of Princeton linemen.

12:17.037 --> 12:18.671
Scott:
That is too unfortunate.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.007
Scott. Scott.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.317
Might have been a little
bit embarrassing...

12:21.341 --> 12:25.312
Are there any plans for a meal?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.646
A meal?

12:26.713 --> 12:29.382
Something to absorb
some of this liquor.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.518
Oh. Oh, yes.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.854
Yes. Of course.
I'm starving.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.956
Food, sustenance, a must.

12:36.023 --> 12:38.191
Here. You can order...

12:38.258 --> 12:40.027
- [buzzing]
- ...whatever you like.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.495
Order everything there is,
why don't you?

12:44.031 --> 12:46.066
♫ When we talk
about the weather ♫

12:46.133 --> 12:47.868
♫ Then we cuddle
close together ♫

12:47.935 --> 12:50.137
- That's great.
- ♫ But wait ♫

12:50.203 --> 12:52.239
♫ You ain't
heard nothin' yet ♫

12:52.305 --> 12:54.641
♫ She's got charms,
such curvy arms ♫

12:54.707 --> 12:56.043
[laughing]

12:56.109 --> 12:57.469
♫ But you ain't
heard nothin' yet ♫

12:57.510 --> 12:59.980
♫ And when those arms
are around my neck ♫

13:00.047 --> 13:02.249
♫ Oh, believe me,
boys, I'm set ♫

13:02.315 --> 13:04.617
♫ And when the lights
are turned down low ♫

13:04.684 --> 13:06.386
♫ I hug and kiss my pet ♫

13:06.453 --> 13:08.555
♫ Now she'd get sore
if I told you more ♫

13:08.621 --> 13:12.092
♫ But you ain't
heard nothin' yet ♫

13:12.159 --> 13:14.061
- [clapping]
- Where is she?

13:14.127 --> 13:17.064
Where is my little Zelda Sayre?

13:18.165 --> 13:20.867
Oh, Zelda, there
you are, darling.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.136
Tallulah!

13:23.203 --> 13:24.604
Eugenia.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.207
You can hear the Montgomery
from across the room.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.441
What a surprise.

13:28.508 --> 13:30.978
Surprise?
Townsend told us
about this shindig.

13:31.044 --> 13:33.313
Thought you might like
to see some faces from home.

13:33.380 --> 13:36.583
Now where is that wunderkind
husband of yours?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.188
♫♫

13:41.254 --> 13:44.224
Dear Mr. Fitzgerald,
I'm not much of a reader.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.159
I usually just skip to my lines.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.629
But I say let's drink
to your brilliant book.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.464
Hear, hear.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.303
[whisper] Save me.

13:58.238 --> 14:01.174
My apologies on behalf
of the Princeton crew.

14:01.241 --> 14:04.144
We're a bit much,
taken all at once.

14:05.412 --> 14:07.047
Or individually.

14:10.283 --> 14:11.684
I've never seen him like this

14:11.751 --> 14:13.186
about anybody, you know?

14:14.121 --> 14:16.023
Hope you're ready.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.993
Because you two are
off to the races.

14:20.928 --> 14:22.795
Does anybody call you Luddy?

14:22.930 --> 14:24.965
No.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.566
Then I will.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.503
A-a-ahem! I have a toast.

14:30.570 --> 14:32.605
I have a toast, everyone.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.145
To the incredible...

14:39.079 --> 14:40.547
incorrigible...

14:40.613 --> 14:41.949
intellectual...

14:42.015 --> 14:44.217
Intellectual? Good God!

14:44.284 --> 14:45.485
Inebriated.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.619
[laughter]

14:46.686 --> 14:49.522
Irascible
F. Scott Fitzgerald

14:49.589 --> 14:51.959
and his beautiful bride.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.593
- To Scott.
- To Scott!

14:53.660 --> 14:55.862
- And his bride.
- His bride!

14:55.963 --> 14:57.597
[applause, cheering]

14:57.664 --> 14:59.099
To Zelda.

15:03.803 --> 15:05.038
Tilde.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.240
- Wait, Tilde.
- Tilde!

15:07.307 --> 15:08.641
You're not leaving already.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.043
The lobster creams just come up.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.611
No, no. I've had quite enough.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.347
I blame you for this.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.084
And I don't think
I'll ever forgive you.

15:18.485 --> 15:20.287
Oh, sure you will.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.354
Tilde.

15:23.856 --> 15:26.526
Tilde, stop.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.461
Tilde.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.298
Why are you leaving?

15:33.000 --> 15:35.102
Because I'm heartbroken, Zelda.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.670
You couldn't wait
for your sister.

15:37.737 --> 15:40.173
It's only Tootsie and me,
and you let Scott...

15:40.240 --> 15:42.542
And I don't want to hear
how modern it all is.

15:42.609 --> 15:46.413
A wedding should be
about tradition and family.

15:46.479 --> 15:50.016
There wasn't a proper
reception or a photographer.

15:50.017 --> 15:51.918
What's Mama going
to put on her wall?

15:52.019 --> 15:54.487
Zelda, that can't be
what you wanted,

15:54.554 --> 15:55.555
what you dreamed of.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.023
Yes, it is.

15:57.024 --> 15:57.924
This is New York.

15:58.025 --> 16:00.527
Yes. And you just got here.

16:00.593 --> 16:03.130
This was your wedding day.

16:03.196 --> 16:06.133
It was supposed to be
about you, not Scott.

16:06.199 --> 16:07.667
It is about me.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.202
And Scott loves me.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.138
He did all this for me.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.540
This is exactly what I want.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.209
If I had wanted a stiff,
boring old party,

16:16.276 --> 16:18.245
I would never
have left Montgomery.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.713
Perhaps you shouldn't have.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.549
This is my life, Tilde,

16:22.615 --> 16:24.717
and I'm gonna love
every minute of it.

16:35.262 --> 16:37.264
- Maybe we should...
- Can't save somebody

16:37.330 --> 16:39.132
who doesn't want to be saved.

16:59.652 --> 17:03.723
Katie, that can certainly
wait until tomorrow.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.358
I suppose it could.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.196
[sigh]
For better or worse,

17:10.262 --> 17:12.732
our girl's a married
woman by now.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.234
Mm-hmm.
Well, the judge say

17:15.301 --> 17:17.837
Montgomery never
seen no Catholic
wedding anyhow,

17:17.904 --> 17:19.439
so this will be fine.

17:21.907 --> 17:23.009
[phone rings]

17:23.109 --> 17:24.777
I'll get it, Katie.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.115
[ring]

17:29.416 --> 17:30.517
Hello.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.320
- Zelda: Mama?
- Oh, baby girl!

17:34.187 --> 17:35.655
I'm married, Mama.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.023
So you are.

17:37.124 --> 17:39.792
It's... Tell me everything,
my girl.

17:39.859 --> 17:42.329
Well, Montgomery's
never seen the likes

17:42.395 --> 17:45.031
of St. Patrick's Cathedral.
I can tell you that.

17:45.132 --> 17:47.367
And I looked right smart
in my spring suit

17:47.434 --> 17:49.636
with your lace
as the crowning effect.

17:49.702 --> 17:52.205
There were flowers
to the rafters, Mama,

17:52.272 --> 17:54.307
so fragrant and lush.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.144
Why, every florist in the
city must have sold out.

17:57.177 --> 17:59.346
Scott thought
of every last detail.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.681
Our honeymoon suite's
on the 18th floor.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.283
- Oh.
- Can you believe

18:03.350 --> 18:05.318
a building could be so high?

18:05.385 --> 18:09.155
And his best man made
the most beautiful speech.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.923
Scott's friends are such a hoot.

18:10.990 --> 18:13.626
We've been dancing for hours.

18:13.693 --> 18:16.229
Oh. What a glorious day.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.700
How's Daddy?

18:20.767 --> 18:25.172
Oh... he's just fine.

18:25.238 --> 18:27.340
Are you happy, baby?

18:27.407 --> 18:30.076
Of course I'm happy, Mama.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.678
Well, I don't want to keep you

18:31.744 --> 18:33.580
from your husband, then.

18:37.049 --> 18:38.618
I love you, Mama.

18:38.685 --> 18:42.189
Give my love to Katie and Daddy.

18:42.255 --> 18:44.191
Be good, Zelda.

19:26.433 --> 19:30.069
Hey, y'all, it's getting late.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.772
Excuse me. Excuse me.

19:32.839 --> 19:33.940
Where's Scott?

19:35.708 --> 19:36.876
Scott. Scott...

If y'all don't mind,

20:22.389 --> 20:25.425
I'd like to have my new
husband to myself now.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.594
[whispering, murmuring]

20:44.744 --> 20:47.246
I couldn't wait one second more.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.855
I was made for you, Scott.

20:57.223 --> 20:59.826
Like you had me ordered,
made, and measured

20:59.892 --> 21:01.093
just for you.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.563
And I want you to wear me.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.332

23:07.887 --> 23:08.955
"It seemed strange

23:09.021 --> 23:10.890

of Union soldiers,

23:10.957 --> 23:13.025
"two or three made him
think of dead loves

exactly like the rest,

23:16.463 --> 23:18.865
even to
the yellowish moss."

23:18.931 --> 23:24.604
Those are my words
from my letter.

23:24.671 --> 23:27.106
Scott, you used my words?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.112
Oh, well...

23:33.179 --> 23:36.482
You made me a part
of your wonderful book

23:36.483 --> 23:37.950
for the whole world to read?

23:39.085 --> 23:40.620
Ohh.

23:43.355 --> 23:44.757
You really did it.

23:46.526 --> 23:47.960
[chuckling]

23:52.064 --> 23:53.500
We did it.

23:53.566 --> 23:56.402
There'll never be just
two of us again.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.605
From now on, we'll be three:

23:58.671 --> 24:02.208
you, me, and us.
