00:17.807 --> 00:19.576
You ready?

00:19.609 --> 00:21.411
No.

00:21.445 --> 00:23.414
Are you ready?

00:23.446 --> 00:24.748
No.

00:26.350 --> 00:27.585
Fuck it, let's do it.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.189
Oh my God, I haven't seen
you guys in so long!

00:32.222 --> 00:33.957
Anderson, you're like
in the forest.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.960
Yeah, and there's
bugs everywhere

00:35.993 --> 00:37.628
and there's people
telling me what to do.

00:37.661 --> 00:40.463
- It's not my vibe.
- So, guys...

00:40.496 --> 00:42.332
Are there tree trimmers
in the forest?

00:42.365 --> 00:45.869
I think the city... the city tree
trims in the forest for fire,

00:45.902 --> 00:47.271
for fire prevention.

00:47.304 --> 00:48.739
I once dated a fireman.

00:48.771 --> 00:49.806
Are you... can you hear me?

00:49.840 --> 00:50.875
- Hey.
- You guys hear that?

00:50.908 --> 00:52.509
I dated a fireman once.

00:52.542 --> 00:54.512
I feel like it did not
get a big reaction.

00:54.545 --> 00:55.980
- I felt like it was a lie.
- Well, 'cause it's a lie.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.815
- Yeah, it's a lie.
- Anyway, you guys, sorry.

00:58.848 --> 01:02.519
Um, thanks for making the time
for this whole

01:02.552 --> 01:04.956
- group call thing.
- Duh, of course.

01:04.989 --> 01:07.490
Totally, but actually,
can we make this quick?

01:07.524 --> 01:09.659
I have a date in a half an hour
with my sexy new boyfriend.

01:09.692 --> 01:11.962
- Okay, rub it in, Vanessa.
- Yeah, you don't need to

01:11.995 --> 01:14.265
personally attack those of us
who are single,

01:14.298 --> 01:16.600
namely your very own
flesh and blood brother

01:16.634 --> 01:18.402
who is very dateable.

01:18.435 --> 01:20.537
Anderson, how are you
even on this call?

01:20.570 --> 01:21.671
They let you have
your computer there?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.573
Oh yeah, I blew one of
the guards so he gave it back.

01:23.606 --> 01:24.474
Oh my God.

01:24.507 --> 01:25.875
Wait, wait, wait,
they have actual guards

01:25.909 --> 01:27.812
- at this wilderness rehab?
- No!

01:27.844 --> 01:29.614
- Obvi this is my burner.
- Huh.

01:29.647 --> 01:31.515
I didn't know burner computers
were a thing.

01:31.548 --> 01:33.451
- It's a rich people thing.
- Oh, the security

01:33.483 --> 01:35.352
at his last rehab was super lax.

01:35.385 --> 01:37.954
- I ended up sneaking in some...
- Guys!

01:37.987 --> 01:41.992
Listen, guys,
you're our oldest friends, so,

01:42.025 --> 01:43.593
Peter and I wanted
to tell you all

01:43.626 --> 01:45.495
at the same time that we're...

01:45.528 --> 01:48.566
Oh my God, you're pregnant!

01:48.599 --> 01:49.834
Oh my God, am I pregnant?

01:49.867 --> 01:51.569
- They're so pregnant.
- Finally!

01:51.602 --> 01:53.737
- Can I be the godmother?
- I'd like to be called

01:53.771 --> 01:55.605
"Aunt" Lauren, not "Ant" Lauren.

01:55.638 --> 01:57.707
- It's gross, you know?
- You guys have to name the baby

01:57.740 --> 01:59.543
after me since I'm the one
who set you up.

01:59.575 --> 02:01.811
Vanessa, shoving the two of them
into your dorm room closet

02:01.844 --> 02:03.581
freshman year
and forcing them to make out

02:03.614 --> 02:04.682
does not count
as setting them up.

02:04.715 --> 02:06.384
Okay, bitch, you're just jealous

02:06.417 --> 02:08.019
'cause I never shoved you
in a closet.

02:08.051 --> 02:10.655
But lest us not forget
that Lauren did inspire me

02:10.687 --> 02:13.390
- to come out of the closet.
- Yes, yes, I'm so glad

02:13.424 --> 02:15.659
that the one time we hooked up
it turned you gay, Anderson.

02:15.693 --> 02:18.296
That's a great college memory
for me to dwell on, thank you.

02:18.329 --> 02:20.531
- You're so welcome.
- Guys!

02:23.766 --> 02:25.669

I don't know.

03:15.419 --> 03:16.320
I wasn't on that call.

03:16.354 --> 03:17.987
I cannot believe
we weren't on that call.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.088
We weren't invited to that call.

03:19.122 --> 03:21.692
I know and I'm upset
that Anderson called you.

03:21.724 --> 03:23.894
Vanessa only texted me and
I feel like this is something

03:23.926 --> 03:24.995
I should've gotten
a phone call about.

03:25.027 --> 03:25.962
Well, it was a short phone call.

03:25.996 --> 03:28.064
I could hardly hear him,
his service was awful.

03:28.098 --> 03:30.000
And honestly,
I think I heard a coyote.

03:30.032 --> 03:32.036
- Like on the phone?
- No, like in the background,

03:32.068 --> 03:33.837
and I know a coyote
when I hear one.

03:33.871 --> 03:35.939
Okay, is it possible
it was like a scheduling thing?

03:35.973 --> 03:38.109
Like, you know how they always
plan stuff on California time

03:38.141 --> 03:39.843
- or specific standard time.
- Pacific Standard Time.

03:39.877 --> 03:41.778
Wait, did you just say specific?

03:41.812 --> 03:43.814
- I did.
- It's Pacific,

03:43.847 --> 03:47.151
'cause, you know, it's like
by the Pacific Ocean.

03:47.183 --> 03:49.387
- Agree to disagree.
- Anyways, whatever.

03:49.419 --> 03:50.553
That's bullshit.

03:50.586 --> 03:51.454
We're only three hours ahead.

03:51.487 --> 03:53.123
What, do they Google Hang
at midnight?

03:53.157 --> 03:55.058
- I would've Google hanged.
- Hung.

03:55.092 --> 03:56.260
- Hung.
- And actually, no,

03:56.293 --> 03:58.795
you wouldn't have because
midnight specific standard time

03:58.829 --> 04:00.931
- is really 3 AM...
- 3 AM Eastern Standard Time.

04:00.963 --> 04:03.768
Yes, I know, and I'm saying
that I would've been available

04:03.800 --> 04:05.536
- and awake to hang.
- Wow.

04:05.568 --> 04:07.470
Oh, I have
a new Postmates order.

04:07.503 --> 04:10.106
Fuck the gig economy,
I have like five jobs right now.

04:10.139 --> 04:11.975
Wait, six, actually.

04:12.008 --> 04:14.644
So I have this new gig,
it's kind of freaky.

04:14.677 --> 04:16.781
Ugh, this order is from
the McDonald's on Bedford.

04:16.814 --> 04:18.415
- They hate me there.
- Oh no, why?

04:18.449 --> 04:20.483
- They hate my rollerblades.
- Is it the yellow?

04:20.516 --> 04:22.420
No, they hate that I wear them
inside their store.

04:22.452 --> 04:24.187
- Restaurant.
- Restaurant, and it's like,

04:24.221 --> 04:25.555
well, then don't have
a rollerblade ramp

04:25.588 --> 04:26.824
that leads directly
to your door.

04:26.857 --> 04:28.759
Feel like that ramp
is for wheelchairs.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.794
Well, rollerblades have wheels.

04:30.827 --> 04:32.162
- I think they're cool.
- They are.

04:32.196 --> 04:33.831
And I think you're cool.

04:33.863 --> 04:35.632
Not cool enough
to be on a Zoom call

04:35.665 --> 04:37.067
to hear about our friends
getting a divorce.

04:37.100 --> 04:39.570
Oh, I forgot about that
for like four seconds.

04:42.839 --> 04:46.643

05:19.877 --> 05:22.879

I'll be back next Tuesday.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.120
Don't be late, y'all.

05:31.153 --> 05:35.593
But today, I'm Eleanor Elbow,

05:35.625 --> 05:37.594
the erotic CEO,

05:37.627 --> 05:39.796
and I've got news for you.

05:39.829 --> 05:43.166
I'm losing money left and right,

05:43.199 --> 05:45.034
and I'm pissed off about it.

05:45.067 --> 05:46.603
So pissed off in fact,

05:46.637 --> 05:48.572
that I'm thinking of

05:48.605 --> 05:52.776
stomping all over you...

05:52.809 --> 05:56.514
if things don't turn around.

Oh.

05:59.949 --> 06:03.086

06:03.120 --> 06:05.122
says to me, "Dearest Eleanor,

06:05.154 --> 06:08.024
please lick your elbow
in this one."

06:08.057 --> 06:10.560
Oh, oh, oh.

06:10.593 --> 06:13.764

06:22.706 --> 06:26.277
Yeah, so how does
this sound, yeah?

06:29.680 --> 06:31.781
I can taste my lotion.

06:31.814 --> 06:34.285
It tastes like wealth.

06:36.052 --> 06:38.855
This is freaky.

Speaking of wealth,
don't forget to Venmo me.

Hannah55Baby.

06:44.261 --> 06:46.130
Thank you so much.

06:50.334 --> 06:52.703
Fine!

06:54.605 --> 06:56.840
Oh!

06:56.872 --> 06:58.141
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

06:58.175 --> 06:59.944
Welcome back to my channel,
gentlemen!

06:59.976 --> 07:02.245
I am Jaime,
the top divorce guru.

07:02.278 --> 07:04.714
Thank you all
from the bottom of my heart

07:04.747 --> 07:07.718
for the overwhelming response
on last week's video.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.120
Three foolproof compliments
that trigger women's libidos.

07:11.153 --> 07:14.190
Go check it out
but only, and only,

07:14.223 --> 07:15.725
if you're ready to handle

07:15.759 --> 07:18.362
the overwhelming amount
of attention

07:18.394 --> 07:20.063
you're gonna get
from them bitches.

07:20.096 --> 07:21.831
All right,
let's get this started.

07:21.865 --> 07:24.134
Each week I share my mind hacks

07:24.166 --> 07:27.170
on how to efficiently
navigate a divorce,

07:27.204 --> 07:30.608
or as I like to call it,
a course correction.

07:30.641 --> 07:32.776
Through my journey
of spouse disentanglement,

07:32.809 --> 07:35.079
I have discovered
how to skip the drama

07:35.112 --> 07:38.749
and get you ready for your next
honey mama, trademark.

07:38.781 --> 07:41.618
As you guys know, my last
divorce was six months ago.

07:41.651 --> 07:44.687
I've already reached a special
and crucial landmark

07:44.721 --> 07:46.090
in the divorce cycle,

07:46.122 --> 07:48.391
the reclaiming of space.

07:48.425 --> 07:51.228
Some of you might not
be at this stage yet,

07:51.261 --> 07:54.798
and some of you might actually
take a few years to get here.

07:54.831 --> 07:56.400
Just remember what I always say.

07:56.432 --> 07:58.067
Be patient with yourself.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.903
You're going through a lot,
and sooner or later,

08:00.937 --> 08:03.407
you'll hook up with someone hot,
all right, trademark.

08:05.041 --> 08:07.644
Bro, I'm in the middle
of my vlog!

08:07.677 --> 08:11.214
Hey, how could
I have known that?

08:11.247 --> 08:12.750
- Think about it.
- I told you,

08:12.783 --> 08:15.252
you have to text me five minutes
before you get home.

08:15.285 --> 08:16.687
What if I'm, like,
in the middle of this,

08:16.720 --> 08:18.422
like, super dope thought process

08:18.454 --> 08:22.325
and then bam, you walk in
and interrupt my flow?

08:22.358 --> 08:24.027
Look, Jaime,

08:24.060 --> 08:26.796
I'm not gonna text you
every time I come home.

08:26.829 --> 08:30.133
I was happy to move in
when Rosa left you.

08:30.166 --> 08:33.169
But listen, I'm not just staying
at your pad.

08:33.202 --> 08:35.972
I pay rent,
this is my home too now, okay?

08:36.005 --> 08:39.375
If I interrupt your flow,
I'm sure you can get it back.

08:39.408 --> 08:43.746
Bro, you do not understand
my flow state, but cool.

08:43.779 --> 08:45.915
Don't you edit these videos
afterwards anyway?

08:45.948 --> 08:48.685
Sure, but it's not that simple,
but I'll just do that.

08:48.719 --> 08:50.287
- Thank you.
- Great.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.789
Glad you figured it out.

09:03.799 --> 09:05.435
- Can you just...
- What?

09:05.469 --> 09:10.140
Nothing, I just really need
to finish this today.

09:10.173 --> 09:11.207
All right, bud.

09:11.240 --> 09:15.044
I'll get out of your hair.

09:15.077 --> 09:18.481
You know, I'm really glad
your therapist suggested

09:18.514 --> 09:21.250
you make this whole
video diary thing.

09:21.283 --> 09:23.187
It's not a video diary thing.

09:23.220 --> 09:26.322
I'm helping other people that
are more fucked up than I am.

09:26.355 --> 09:28.391
And I came up with that idea
on my own,

09:28.424 --> 09:30.993
after she suggested it.

09:31.027 --> 09:32.329
You're doing such a great job.

09:32.361 --> 09:34.831
Can you fuck off, please?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.234
I'm gonna give you some space.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.335
Thank you.

09:38.368 --> 09:39.436
You're super welcome, bud.

09:39.469 --> 09:41.138
Oh my God!

09:44.441 --> 09:45.942
Reclaiming your space.

09:45.975 --> 09:47.244
What does that mean?

09:47.277 --> 09:48.378
Great question.

09:48.410 --> 09:50.079
Let me break it down for you.

09:50.113 --> 09:51.348
The first thing you gotta do

09:51.380 --> 09:52.783
when you're reclaiming
your space

09:52.816 --> 09:55.319
from the divorce is tackle...

10:02.558 --> 10:05.261
"The most crucial step
to moving through a divorce

10:05.294 --> 10:07.363
is releasing emotions.

10:07.397 --> 10:11.135
You and your partner should cry
openly and cry often."

10:19.142 --> 10:20.878
He hasn't cried.

10:23.078 --> 10:25.982
Why the fuck hasn't he cried?

10:28.217 --> 10:29.319
Peter?

10:31.321 --> 10:32.456
Peter.

10:34.890 --> 10:35.825
Are you fucking kidding me?

10:35.859 --> 10:37.795
Peter!

10:45.902 --> 10:47.237
- Were you calling me?
- No.

10:47.269 --> 10:51.107
Hey, so, I know
it's gonna be super hard

10:51.140 --> 10:53.276
and, you know, you've probably
just been avoiding it

10:53.309 --> 10:57.079
because it's gonna be
so, so sad,

10:57.113 --> 11:00.251
but I think it's time
we split up our stuff.

11:02.184 --> 11:03.553
Sure.

11:03.586 --> 11:06.088
It's probably just gonna be
really hard for us,

11:06.121 --> 11:09.058
or for you because we've built
a life together,

11:09.091 --> 11:11.160
and how do you even start
to begin

11:11.193 --> 11:13.529
to choose who deserves what?

11:13.562 --> 11:15.331
I mean, I can't even fathom
where to begin.

11:15.365 --> 11:17.935
It's, it's like

11:17.967 --> 11:21.304
ripping apart
the quilt of our love,

11:21.337 --> 11:25.308
piece by piece.

11:25.341 --> 11:28.245
I mean, I guess we can start
in the living room.

11:31.347 --> 11:32.615
Wow.

11:32.649 --> 11:36.052
Yeah, how did I not think
of that?

11:36.086 --> 11:37.221
Let's do it.

11:44.961 --> 11:46.330
Would you like the chair?

11:46.363 --> 11:48.031
I know you've always loved it.

11:48.063 --> 11:48.932
Really?

11:48.965 --> 11:51.301
I mean, your aunt
gave you that chair.

11:51.333 --> 11:53.135
- You should keep it.
- Remember that time

11:53.168 --> 11:57.073
when I as holding your nephew
and he was staring up at me

11:57.106 --> 12:00.009
with those big,
beautiful, blue eyes,

12:00.043 --> 12:04.413
and he vomited all over me
and some got on the chair?

12:04.447 --> 12:08.652
You know, that was the first
moment that I realized...

12:08.684 --> 12:10.620
sorry...

12:10.653 --> 12:15.558
that I realized that
we would be parents, you know?

12:15.591 --> 12:18.995
It'll always be
a perfect memory for me.

12:19.028 --> 12:21.197
What could have been.

12:21.230 --> 12:23.033
Hm.

12:23.066 --> 12:25.035
I think you're forgetting
that the smell of vomit

12:25.067 --> 12:25.936
actually made me vomit.

12:25.969 --> 12:29.273
I mean, there was a lot of vomit
that day.

12:29.306 --> 12:30.507
That was actually the day
that I realized

12:30.539 --> 12:33.043
that maybe I didn't want
to have kids.

12:33.076 --> 12:34.211
You know, like before then
obviously I was like,

12:34.244 --> 12:36.513
yeah, for sure, but then
that happened and I was like,

12:36.546 --> 12:38.382
- I don't know.
- Huh.

12:38.414 --> 12:41.418
It's funny, like, same memory,

12:41.451 --> 12:43.552
different emotional
attachments to it.

12:43.586 --> 12:45.989
Totally, totally different,
you know?

12:46.022 --> 12:49.158
To each... woo, oh...
to each their own, you know?

12:49.192 --> 12:52.696
Uh, a happy memory for me,

12:52.729 --> 12:55.666
and a sad...

12:55.698 --> 12:58.968
and emotional memory for you.

12:59.001 --> 13:01.637
You know, very sad.

13:01.671 --> 13:06.109
Extremely emotional.

13:06.142 --> 13:07.311
- Right.
- Okay.

13:07.344 --> 13:09.212
You can have the chair.

13:09.245 --> 13:11.280
- That I don't give a shit about.
- Okay, fine.

13:11.313 --> 13:14.283
You can call dibs
on one of our shared items

13:14.317 --> 13:17.687
if you tell my brother
about the divorce.

13:17.721 --> 13:19.322
Wait, you haven't told him yet?

13:19.355 --> 13:21.490
I, I thought it
should come from you.

13:21.524 --> 13:22.658
What, why?

13:22.692 --> 13:25.162
Because he sees you
like a brother.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.364
He's like obsessed with you,
just come on, Peter.

13:27.397 --> 13:30.134
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

13:36.373 --> 13:38.208
Just in case.

13:38.240 --> 13:40.276
Uh, thank you?

13:40.309 --> 13:42.645
Go ahead, take one.

13:50.186 --> 13:53.190
So yeah, I'm really sorry, man,

13:53.222 --> 13:54.991
but that's what we decided.

13:55.024 --> 13:56.492
Wait, wait, wait, but you guys
have only been married

13:56.525 --> 13:58.327
- for, like, two years.
- Yeah, no, right,

13:58.360 --> 14:00.129
but we've actually been together
for 10, you know,

14:00.163 --> 14:01.431
and it's complicated.

14:01.464 --> 14:02.632
We're just different people now.

14:02.664 --> 14:04.400
Yeah, of course
you're different people,

14:04.433 --> 14:06.769
but like, I thought
opposites attract.

14:06.802 --> 14:09.105
I don't know what to tell you,
I'm sorry.

14:09.139 --> 14:11.073
So, what, are you like
my ex-brother now or...

14:11.106 --> 14:12.608
I mean, I guess technically,
but...

14:12.642 --> 14:14.011
Whatever, whatever, I gotta go.

14:14.043 --> 14:15.444
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

14:15.477 --> 14:17.080
I love you.

14:19.515 --> 14:22.084
What was that about?

14:22.118 --> 14:24.254
Amy and Peter
are getting a divorce.

14:24.287 --> 14:25.589
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

14:25.621 --> 14:26.889
They haven't even been married
that long.

14:26.923 --> 14:29.492
Yeah, apparently they're like
different people or something.

14:29.525 --> 14:30.726
Of course they're
different people,

14:30.759 --> 14:32.361
but don't like,
opposites attract?

14:32.394 --> 14:34.764
I know, that's what I said!

14:34.798 --> 14:36.265
But we love Peter.

14:36.298 --> 14:38.134
What are we gonna do about that?

14:38.168 --> 14:40.736
I don't know, man.

14:40.769 --> 14:42.338
I don't know.

14:42.371 --> 14:44.407
Wow.

14:44.441 --> 14:46.744
- I am so sorry.
- Thanks.

14:49.645 --> 14:52.581
Well, it's not great timing,

14:52.615 --> 14:55.519
but I actually have a Tinder
date coming in a couple minutes.

14:55.552 --> 14:56.720
- Oh, wow.
- But I could totally

14:56.753 --> 14:58.422
- bail on her.
- No, no, no, it's fine,

14:58.455 --> 14:59.790
it's fine, just be careful,
okay?

14:59.822 --> 15:01.457
Because right now
she's just a Tinder girl,

15:01.490 --> 15:03.159
but next thing you know,
she's your wife,

15:03.192 --> 15:07.329
and then right after that
she's your fucking ex-wife!

15:07.363 --> 15:09.800
But yeah, no, it's fine,
it's chill, she can come over.

15:09.832 --> 15:11.333
You can totally crash
the date if you want.

15:11.366 --> 15:13.502
We have plenty of sushi.

15:13.535 --> 15:14.770
- From where?
- Store-bought.

15:14.803 --> 15:16.572
- Ugh!
- Okay, you are invited.

15:16.605 --> 15:18.475
It's gonna have spicy mayo
all over it.

15:18.508 --> 15:21.078
Ah, I'm Noah,
I'm a bougie ass bitch

15:21.110 --> 15:22.511
and I don't have
a brother-in-law anymore.

15:22.544 --> 15:23.512
- Too far, man.
- Yeah,

15:23.546 --> 15:26.583
it didn't feel right saying it.

15:26.615 --> 15:27.884
You know what,
whatever, fuck it.

15:27.918 --> 15:30.120
I'm fucking with you, let's go
eat some shitty Cali rolls.

15:30.153 --> 15:31.587
- Come on.
- Wow!

15:31.620 --> 15:32.688
Wait, I'm dead.

15:32.721 --> 15:35.257
No, I'm literally dying.

15:35.291 --> 15:36.493
Is this a joke?

15:36.525 --> 15:37.493
Do you wanna start with cardio...

15:37.527 --> 15:38.595
Shut up.

15:38.628 --> 15:40.397
I'm sorry, what?

15:40.429 --> 15:43.165
Oh my God, oh my God!

15:43.198 --> 15:44.433
I cannot believe this.

15:44.466 --> 15:47.336
I'm truly shocked to my core.

15:47.370 --> 15:49.873
Amy and Peter, no.

15:49.905 --> 15:52.174
No, never in a million years
would I have guessed this.

15:52.207 --> 15:54.276
Honestly, honestly,
you know what,

15:54.309 --> 15:56.579
I need to go work out,
this is a lot for me to take in.

15:56.613 --> 15:57.881
Okay, I'll call you later.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.249
All right, love you.

15:59.282 --> 16:01.317
Kiss, kiss.

16:05.522 --> 16:07.691
I mean, did I call it
or did I fucking call it?

16:07.724 --> 16:09.392
- What?
- Okay.

16:09.424 --> 16:11.260
You remember my friends
from college?

16:11.293 --> 16:12.394
Babe, stretch me.

16:12.428 --> 16:15.298
Obviously not my Gamma Phi
sisters, my other friends.

16:15.331 --> 16:17.701
- You know, the trashy ones.
- Um...

16:17.734 --> 16:19.168
Amy and Peter!

16:19.201 --> 16:20.236
The brunette and her husband.

16:20.269 --> 16:21.170
They met out freshman year

16:21.205 --> 16:22.339
and they've been together
ever since.

16:22.371 --> 16:24.274
Ugh, anyways.

16:24.307 --> 16:25.841
They're getting divorced,

16:25.875 --> 16:28.278
and I hate to say
that I saw this coming,

16:28.311 --> 16:30.846
but I absolutely saw
this coming.

16:32.849 --> 16:36.586
- Hello!
- Mary Grace, hey!

16:36.619 --> 16:38.488
- Hey, sweet girl!
- Can you hear me okay?

16:38.520 --> 16:40.623
I can hear you loud and clear
and I can see you.

16:40.657 --> 16:43.560
- You look gorgeous, girl!
- Oh, thank you.

16:43.592 --> 16:46.328
Wow, uh, it's been a minute.

16:46.361 --> 16:47.831
Gosh, it's been several minutes.

16:47.864 --> 16:50.667
I mean, when is the last time
we saw each other?

16:50.700 --> 16:52.769
Was it Carolann's
niece's baptism?

16:52.802 --> 16:56.406
No, yeah, no, didn't fly back in
for that one.

16:56.438 --> 16:58.574
Well, shoot,
we miss you around here.

16:58.607 --> 17:00.876
These teens today,
I am telling you,

17:00.909 --> 17:04.480
they do not make the youth
like they used to!

17:04.512 --> 17:06.348
Wow, you're still
the youth pastor.

17:06.382 --> 17:08.185
You were my youth pastor, wow.

17:08.218 --> 17:10.287
Yes, ma'am, 14 years strong.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.887
That is a long time
to pastor youth, Jesus.

17:12.922 --> 17:15.392
- Ah.
- Sorry, geez Louise!

17:15.424 --> 17:18.228
Anyway, um, my mom told me
you had another baby?

17:18.260 --> 17:19.863
Have you not met my son Henry?

17:19.895 --> 17:21.664
He just turned three last month!

17:21.698 --> 17:22.865
- Oh my goodness.
- Yup.

17:22.897 --> 17:26.301
Bill finally got his boy,
but enough about me and mine.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.337
Those rug rats are over
at Janine's until six.

17:28.371 --> 17:31.740
I got my glass of Pinot Grigio,
I got on my soft clothes.

17:31.773 --> 17:35.377
I am ready for some girl talk!

17:35.411 --> 17:36.846
So now tell me, your mother says

17:36.878 --> 17:38.714
there's something
we need to pray on.

17:38.748 --> 17:42.251
Oh, oh yeah, no, no, that's...
I'm so sorry she called you.

17:42.285 --> 17:43.620
She just, um...

17:43.653 --> 17:45.755
well, my friends
are actually getting divorced

17:45.788 --> 17:47.524
and then she kind of
freaked out about it, so...

17:47.557 --> 17:50.993
Wait, we need to bless
this conversation first.

17:51.027 --> 17:54.831
If you will, bow your head
and hold my hands virtually.

17:54.864 --> 17:56.600
Okay.

17:56.633 --> 17:58.934
Dear sweet, sweet Lord,

17:58.968 --> 18:03.306
We humbly accept your love
and come before you today

18:03.338 --> 18:06.909
to talk on Facetime
while you eavesdrop

18:06.942 --> 18:09.746
as we reflect
on Lauren's struggles

18:09.778 --> 18:11.548
to find a partner in life.

18:11.580 --> 18:12.581
Uh...

18:12.615 --> 18:15.417
Help us open Lauren's heart
to find a match

18:15.451 --> 18:18.255
so she can procreate
in your name.

18:18.288 --> 18:20.957
- What?
- Her mother is in pain, Lord!

18:20.990 --> 18:24.394
Ease her heart, ease her mind,

18:24.426 --> 18:26.328
ease her mouth.

18:26.362 --> 18:28.331
Evelyn wants
these grandbabies so bad,

18:28.364 --> 18:30.033
she can't breathe at night!

18:30.066 --> 18:33.435
- She can breathe.
- Help us open Lauren's heart.

18:33.469 --> 18:37.606
Help her find her love,
whoever she wants to love.

18:37.640 --> 18:39.676
I mean it, Jesus.

18:39.709 --> 18:41.845
Amen.

18:41.877 --> 18:43.646
So do you like women?

18:43.680 --> 18:45.649
- What?
- Now listen here, Lauren,

18:45.682 --> 18:47.450
I'm done drawing a line
in the sand.

18:47.482 --> 18:48.550
I'm done with it.

18:48.584 --> 18:51.788
You wanna love a she,
you wanna love a they, live.

18:51.820 --> 18:55.357
- Okay, I like men, so...
- Well, good!

18:55.391 --> 18:57.527
Okay, well, hold on now.

18:57.559 --> 18:58.560
I didn't mean good.

18:58.594 --> 19:00.730
I just meant I'm more familiar,

19:00.762 --> 19:04.300
but if you want to like a she,
if you want to like a they,

19:04.334 --> 19:06.068
that is fine by me.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.836
You heard of the book
Queer Grace?

19:07.869 --> 19:09.705
Uh, no, uh-uh.

19:09.739 --> 19:13.410
Well, it rocked my world.

19:13.442 --> 19:14.844
It's by Kelly Jo Welch.

19:14.876 --> 19:17.946
She's a lovely woman of God
and other women,

19:17.980 --> 19:21.084
and she's just wise beyond
her years and I learned things.

19:21.116 --> 19:22.719
Lauren, love is love!

19:22.751 --> 19:25.321
Uh, listen, Mary Grace,
I'm so proud of you.

19:25.355 --> 19:27.557
That's great, I'm so glad
you've come around.

19:27.589 --> 19:29.658
I just... I'm not gay.

19:29.692 --> 19:33.028
Evelyn told me she knows
and she's proud of you!

19:33.061 --> 19:34.730
Wait, my mom thinks I'm gay?

19:34.763 --> 19:37.733
And if you'll just let Jesus
come in your mouth

19:37.767 --> 19:41.638
and give you the courage
to speak your truth,

19:41.671 --> 19:43.506
you can settle down
with a nice woman

19:43.538 --> 19:45.674
and your mother
can get those grandbabies.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.410
- Oh my God.
- Let me tell you a story.

19:47.442 --> 19:48.411
All right?

19:48.443 --> 19:49.913
You remember back
in your youth group days,

19:49.945 --> 19:51.914
Stewart Douglas, Trevor Scott?

19:51.948 --> 19:53.917
Remember those two boys,
hoodlums?

19:53.950 --> 19:55.818
- Yeah.
- They used to say

19:55.852 --> 19:57.754
behind your back all the time,

19:57.787 --> 20:00.723
"Oh, there goes Lauren
hunting fish.

20:00.757 --> 20:03.759
Oh, she loves to hunt trout,"
they'd say.

20:03.792 --> 20:05.661
And I thought, "Well, dang!

20:05.694 --> 20:07.563
I didn't even know
she liked fishing this much.

20:07.596 --> 20:09.531
Maybe she's out there fishing
on the weekend with her daddy.

20:09.565 --> 20:10.500
I don't know!"

20:10.532 --> 20:13.502
It took me two years to realize

20:13.536 --> 20:17.707
they weren't even
talking about fishing.

20:17.740 --> 20:19.642
They were calling you
a lesbian predator.

20:19.674 --> 20:22.044
Yeah, Mary Grace,
they were fucking with me.

20:22.077 --> 20:23.812
- Ah.
- Messing with me.

20:23.846 --> 20:27.851
And I prayed
and I prayed for you!

20:27.884 --> 20:29.818
And then I read
Making Room on the Pew

20:29.852 --> 20:32.655
by Kelly Jo Welch,
and let me tell you,

20:32.688 --> 20:34.824
it just opened my mind!

20:34.856 --> 20:36.992
You can love however you want.

20:37.026 --> 20:39.696
You don't need...

20:39.729 --> 20:42.532
You can have two...

20:42.565 --> 20:43.732
Vaginas?

20:43.766 --> 20:45.634
We say front tushy
in this house.

20:45.667 --> 20:47.669
Anyway, I think you know
what I'm talking about.

20:47.702 --> 20:49.839
What are you talking about?

20:51.941 --> 20:54.744
Jesus fucking Christ,
Mary Grace!

20:54.777 --> 20:58.581
I have had upwards of 32 dicks
in my body, okay?

20:58.614 --> 20:59.949
I am not a lesbian!

21:05.654 --> 21:08.892
Oh, look at my sexy man
grilling me some sexy meat.

21:08.924 --> 21:11.493
Oh, my little crudite girl.

21:11.527 --> 21:13.462
Why are you wearing your
blue light glasses outside?

21:13.496 --> 21:14.998
Well, there's no easy way
to say this

21:15.030 --> 21:16.932
but we're living in
a simulation, babe.

21:16.965 --> 21:20.169
Every second is screen time,
so keeping these on for good.

21:20.202 --> 21:22.172
So what you're saying is
you got high without me.

21:22.204 --> 21:25.574
- Exactly.
- Wow!

21:25.607 --> 21:26.509
Wow.

21:26.541 --> 21:27.810
Four weeks into the relationship

21:27.844 --> 21:29.879
and you're already
sneaking around.

21:29.912 --> 21:31.815
Hey, hey, come on.

21:31.847 --> 21:34.017
- What?
- No, stay off the nips!

21:34.049 --> 21:36.752
If you let me do it,
I will forgive you.

21:36.786 --> 21:39.055
Okay, lightly, light... ow!

21:39.087 --> 21:40.789
All right, okay, okay.

21:40.823 --> 21:42.025
Okay, you're forgiven.

21:42.057 --> 21:43.992
All right, thank you,
I gotta flip.

21:44.026 --> 21:47.864
Okay, but just remember, I like
my men how I like my meats.

21:47.896 --> 21:50.200
Rare, because you're
one of a kind,

21:50.232 --> 21:52.100
and I like my meats bloody.

21:52.134 --> 21:55.137
Oh, which reminds me,
I have a new project for us,

21:55.171 --> 21:57.974
- but first, carrot?
- Sure.

21:58.007 --> 22:00.777
- Ranch shot?
- Always, yeah.

22:03.211 --> 22:04.913
No teeth!

22:04.946 --> 22:06.949
Don't bite it, you use lips,

22:06.982 --> 22:10.019
use your lips, use your lips.

22:10.051 --> 22:12.020
God, Ranch is so sexual.

22:12.054 --> 22:14.257
Should we leave these meats
and go to the bedroom?

22:14.289 --> 22:15.892
No, they're almost ready.

22:15.924 --> 22:18.228
Really, so no?

22:18.260 --> 22:21.498
Okay, well that leads me
to our project.

22:21.530 --> 22:23.066
I think we can both agree
that up until now,

22:23.098 --> 22:24.299
the sex has been amazing.

22:24.334 --> 22:26.903
- Yeah, it's been great.
- I know, it's not surprising.

22:26.935 --> 22:28.770
All my boyfriends
say that about me.

22:28.804 --> 22:29.538
You mean "said that."

22:29.571 --> 22:30.739
They're not still saying that,

22:30.772 --> 22:31.874
'cause you're not still
having sex with them, right?

22:31.906 --> 22:36.745
Okay, but I think we're on
the edge of the phase

22:36.778 --> 22:38.580
where it's like
new relationship,

22:38.614 --> 22:40.115
the sex is always amazing,

22:40.148 --> 22:43.118
and the phase of, "Ugh,
we never have sex anymore

22:43.152 --> 22:44.787
and it's always missionary,

22:44.819 --> 22:46.923
and even when we do have
missionary sex,

22:46.955 --> 22:48.757
it's really dry and boring

22:48.790 --> 22:50.259
and you think about CNN
the whole time."

22:50.292 --> 22:51.927
But we're in the first phase,
right?

22:51.961 --> 22:54.029
Gabriel, Gabriel,
you're missing the point.

22:54.063 --> 22:56.566
It's scientifically proven
in the first four weeks,

22:56.598 --> 22:59.034
we should be at a 10
on "el pasión" scale.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.170
Sure, we're having sex
in restaurant bathrooms

23:01.202 --> 23:03.006
and in your car
and at your mom's house.

23:03.038 --> 23:04.606
On my mom's house.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.076
I got second degree burns
on my back from the roof.

23:07.108 --> 23:10.178
And I'm sorry for that, but if
we don't do something now,

23:10.211 --> 23:13.081
we're gonna end up boring
and divorced and brunette,

23:13.115 --> 23:14.250
and you know I don't have
the face shape

23:14.282 --> 23:15.884
- to support brown hair.
- Okay, but...

23:15.917 --> 23:18.287
Imagine this
with a brown wig on.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.923
It'd look insane, I'd look like
one of the Little Women.

23:20.957 --> 23:22.859
What are you trying
to say right now?

23:22.892 --> 23:24.727
You wanna try some freaky shit?

23:24.759 --> 23:27.163
Exactly,
please clear your schedule.

23:27.195 --> 23:29.264
We're gonna start
with a spa day,

23:29.298 --> 23:32.769
a little role play,
a little dash of danger.

23:32.801 --> 23:34.636
It's good to get
the adrenaline pumping

23:34.670 --> 23:37.173
before we dive into
some new areas.

23:37.205 --> 23:40.142
- Ow.
- Sexual exploration.

23:40.175 --> 23:41.343
All right, fuck it.

23:41.376 --> 23:43.011
Let's explore.

23:43.045 --> 23:44.279
"They'll explore the idea,"

23:44.313 --> 23:45.882
is the how mayor's people
put it.

23:45.914 --> 23:47.349
That's hopeful.

23:47.383 --> 23:49.052
You're optimistic tonight.

23:49.085 --> 23:51.019
Let me remind you
we're up against men

23:51.053 --> 23:52.622
and their Maseratis here.

23:52.654 --> 23:53.990
Jesus Christ!

23:54.022 --> 23:55.991
This dog!

23:56.025 --> 23:58.027
He's a dog.

23:58.059 --> 24:00.096
Can you imagine the day
Los Angeles

24:00.128 --> 24:02.365
has more bicycles
on the streets than cars?

24:02.397 --> 24:05.233
Can you imagine a day
when people train their dogs?

24:07.236 --> 24:08.805
It's a noble cause, baby.

24:08.837 --> 24:10.839
Shutting down Sea World
is a noble cause.

24:10.873 --> 24:12.808
No bike lanes, that's just
your run of the mill

24:12.842 --> 24:14.811
public health crisis.

24:14.844 --> 24:18.948
Well, you're killing it
and I'm proud of you.

24:18.980 --> 24:20.983
Oh my God, I almost forgot.

24:21.017 --> 24:24.019
I got quite the compliment
at City Hall today.

24:24.053 --> 24:25.788
- Nice.
- We were just standing around

24:25.820 --> 24:28.357
after the meeting talking and
this councilman came up to me

24:28.391 --> 24:31.194
and he said, "You're quite
effective when you're angry."

24:31.227 --> 24:32.762
And before I could even
say anything,

24:32.795 --> 24:35.098
he whips out his business card
and says,

24:35.131 --> 24:36.699
"You have what it takes, kid.

24:36.731 --> 24:39.167
Call me, my personal number."

24:39.201 --> 24:41.671
Like, ew!

24:41.703 --> 24:43.071
And he called me kid!

24:43.105 --> 24:45.741
And then what makes it even
weirder is that...

24:55.851 --> 24:57.353
- Wow.
- Douchebag.

25:07.128 --> 25:09.164
What?

25:09.198 --> 25:10.432
You're doing the thing.

25:10.465 --> 25:12.801
- What thing?
- What thing?

25:16.137 --> 25:17.740
Forget it.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.076
What thing?

25:48.938 --> 25:51.207
Oh my God, it's Fuckface.

25:54.375 --> 25:55.478
♪ Listen up ♪

26:00.750 --> 26:02.018
♪ Listen up ♪

26:15.463 --> 26:18.067
♪ Oop ♪

26:18.099 --> 26:20.435
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

26:34.083 --> 26:36.451
Damn.

26:36.484 --> 26:39.121
That's a nice deck.

26:39.154 --> 26:43.024
There were three things
my wife never let me have.

26:43.057 --> 26:46.461
A drum kit, a motorcycle,
and a threesome.

26:46.494 --> 26:48.997
Happy to say
that I recently crossed

26:49.030 --> 26:51.399
two out of those three
off my list,

26:51.432 --> 26:53.402
and let's just say,

26:53.434 --> 26:55.804
I still can't wait
to get that bike.

26:57.373 --> 26:59.475
So, this is my new baby.

26:59.508 --> 27:02.245
A Pearl Export drum kit.

27:02.278 --> 27:04.180
When I was married
to my honeybunch...

27:10.085 --> 27:11.386
When I was married,

27:11.420 --> 27:14.090
the ex forbid me
from buying one.

27:14.123 --> 27:16.558
She was like, "Um,
where are you gonna store it?

27:16.592 --> 27:18.427
And you don't even know
how to play the drums.

27:18.460 --> 27:20.563
And you should save money
and go back to school."

27:20.596 --> 27:22.131
Well, guess what,

27:22.163 --> 27:23.865
the first thing I did
when she left

27:23.898 --> 27:25.200
was go straight to Craigslist

27:25.233 --> 27:27.169
and I bought this sexy beast.

27:28.403 --> 27:31.540
And the best part is with
her side of the closet empty,

27:31.574 --> 27:33.976
there's plenty of room
to store it!

27:34.009 --> 27:37.246
And the only school
I'm about to attend

27:37.278 --> 27:39.949
is the school of rock, baby!

27:39.981 --> 27:42.417
One, two, three, four!

27:42.451 --> 27:45.387
This is what reclaiming
your space sounds like.

27:51.460 --> 27:53.461
That is the last time

27:53.494 --> 27:57.432
you're playing the drums
in the house.

27:57.465 --> 28:00.936
- Right, buddy?
- Yeah!

28:00.970 --> 28:03.573
Another important practice
on reclaiming your space

28:03.605 --> 28:05.540
is to stand or sit in spots

28:05.574 --> 28:08.510
that have significant memories
of your honeybunch...

28:12.080 --> 28:15.483
...of your ex, ex,

28:15.517 --> 28:18.221
of your ex, and then you say
to yourself,

28:18.253 --> 28:21.356
"I reclaim this space."

28:21.390 --> 28:25.161
For example,
this is where we would spend

28:25.193 --> 28:27.963
most of our evenings
watching Netflix.

28:27.997 --> 28:30.199
She loved watching rom-coms

28:30.231 --> 28:32.100
'cause she thought
they were funny

28:32.134 --> 28:34.103
even though she knew
they were cheesy,

28:34.135 --> 28:37.973
and I was bored the whole time,
so I was like, "Whatever,"

28:38.007 --> 28:42.612
but she would laugh at them
and her laugh was like,

28:42.644 --> 28:45.114
you know,
low-key pretty magical,

28:45.146 --> 28:46.448
and...

28:51.487 --> 28:53.323
...it was hell.

28:55.924 --> 28:57.993
Ahh!

28:58.027 --> 29:00.363
That's an example
of what we like to call

29:00.395 --> 29:01.530
porcupine memories!

29:01.564 --> 29:04.933
The name refers to memories
that are seemingly so cute

29:04.967 --> 29:07.270
and happy and you just want
to hold on to them,

29:07.303 --> 29:09.138
but when you hug them, bam,

29:09.171 --> 29:11.641
needles, ouch,
porcupine memories!

29:11.673 --> 29:14.143
Trademark pending.

29:14.175 --> 29:17.379
I reclaim my space.

29:17.413 --> 29:19.448
I reclaim my space!

29:19.480 --> 29:22.484
I reclaim my space!

29:22.518 --> 29:25.587
Shut the fuck up, buddy!

29:28.022 --> 29:29.658
Wow.

29:32.694 --> 29:34.897
Wow, 32.

29:36.298 --> 29:38.433
As in 32...

29:38.467 --> 29:40.236
actual penises?

29:40.269 --> 29:41.503
Yeah, give or take.

29:41.537 --> 29:44.507
Honestly, it's probably a bit
higher than that, but yeah, 32.

29:44.539 --> 29:46.509
Oh my lanta!

29:46.541 --> 29:49.177
Well, dang, Kelly Jo Welch
didn't prepare me for this.

29:49.211 --> 29:51.614
I'm sorry, Mary Grace,
I'm sorry for my language.

29:51.646 --> 29:53.381
I'm sorry I'm being so crass.

29:53.414 --> 29:55.216
I'm so glad we got to catch up,

29:55.250 --> 29:57.286
but I am sorry my mom
made you do this.

29:57.318 --> 29:59.521
I just... you know, I haven't
found the right guy yet,

29:59.555 --> 30:02.358
so maybe you could
just tell her I'm looking

30:02.391 --> 30:03.426
and I'm not a lesbian.

30:03.459 --> 30:06.262
Um, but yeah, I guess
I should probably go, so...

30:06.295 --> 30:08.197
Oh, no, no, no, please don't go,
please don't go.

30:08.230 --> 30:10.499
I still have half a bottle
of Pinot Grigio left.

30:10.531 --> 30:14.971
Look, I've been watching HBO
after Bill goes to bed.

30:15.003 --> 30:16.271
Okay?

30:16.305 --> 30:18.474
And I've been learning
some new stuff,

30:18.507 --> 30:20.176
and all the women at the church
wanna talk about

30:20.209 --> 30:21.744
is when is the rapture coming,

30:21.777 --> 30:24.380
and obviously,
it is already here.

30:24.413 --> 30:26.248
So I need this!

30:26.280 --> 30:28.683
Lauren, I need this, please.

30:28.717 --> 30:31.354
Okay, okay.

30:31.386 --> 30:33.621
Yeah, sure, I can chat
for a few more minutes.

30:33.654 --> 30:36.057
Okay, great, all right,
let's quickly hang up our call

30:36.090 --> 30:38.226
with Jesus 'cause he does not
need to hear this.

30:38.259 --> 30:40.028
Goodnight, Jesus,
I'll call you later.

30:40.061 --> 30:41.663
Okay, now it's just you and me.

30:41.696 --> 30:44.265
Lay it on me, honey!

30:44.298 --> 30:47.103
Thirty-two, thirty-two!

30:47.135 --> 30:49.137
Gosh almighty,
are you using special creams?

30:49.171 --> 30:50.673
You must be sore all the time.

30:50.705 --> 30:53.274
Oh, yeah, no,
I know it sounds like a lot,

30:53.307 --> 30:55.044
but you know,
it's actually not that crazy.

30:55.076 --> 30:56.444
I just got busy in college.

30:56.478 --> 30:58.748
- Who didn't?
- I didn't.

30:58.780 --> 31:01.517
- Bill and I waited.
- Oh, okay.

31:01.549 --> 31:04.386
Uh, but I mean, gosh,
you guys have three kids now.

31:04.420 --> 31:06.087
You must be making up
for lost time, right?

31:06.121 --> 31:08.124
No, no.

31:08.156 --> 31:10.625
Look, look, I love Bill
and I do think about him

31:10.659 --> 31:12.628
and Nathan Fillion from Castle,

31:12.661 --> 31:14.797
but can I tell you a secret?

31:14.829 --> 31:17.098
'Cause I just haven't been able
to talk to anybody about this,

31:17.132 --> 31:18.601
and since you're
a liberal elite sinner...

31:18.634 --> 31:23.305
- Okay, harsh.
- I just feel like you'll get it.

31:23.337 --> 31:26.709
I don't want Bill to hear me.

31:26.741 --> 31:30.445
I'm not sexually satisfied
at all.

31:30.479 --> 31:31.646
Oh, Jesus Christ.

31:31.680 --> 31:33.282
No, don't call Jesus right now.

31:33.315 --> 31:35.551
No, no,
that's not what I... okay.

31:35.584 --> 31:37.620
Help me, Lauren, please!

31:37.653 --> 31:40.556
Okay, you're a sexual deviant
and my only hope.

31:40.588 --> 31:43.224
I need you!

31:43.258 --> 31:45.394
Okay, okay, wow.

31:45.426 --> 31:48.163
Okay, sorry, I'm just wrapping
my head around this.

31:48.196 --> 31:50.098
Yeah, go ahead, Mary Grace.

31:50.132 --> 31:52.334
I, uh, I wanna help.

31:52.366 --> 31:54.436
Just tell me,
tell me your troubles.

31:54.470 --> 31:56.271
Okay.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.807
Well, it all started

31:57.839 --> 31:59.841
when I accidentally brushed
against the jets

31:59.875 --> 32:03.278
in the jacuzzi tub
and it stirred me deep.

32:03.311 --> 32:06.314
Oh my go... oh my gosh!

32:06.347 --> 32:07.316
I can't believe
I'm telling you this!

32:07.348 --> 32:09.551
Oh, you know what, Mary Grace,
it's great,

32:09.585 --> 32:12.188
and I wasn't expecting the call
to go this way,

32:12.221 --> 32:13.855
but I'm honestly...
I'm here for it.

32:13.888 --> 32:16.125
I just think that I probably
need some wine too,

32:16.157 --> 32:19.360
- so I will BRB, okay?
- All right.

32:19.394 --> 32:22.597
I'll just be here thinking
about Mr. Fillion,

32:22.631 --> 32:25.500
from Castle.

32:25.534 --> 32:27.670
Mr. Castle.

32:29.637 --> 32:31.740
Solve my crimes,

32:31.772 --> 32:33.108
solve my crimes.

32:34.742 --> 32:36.377
I don't know,
maybe this just grew apart.

32:36.411 --> 32:37.479
- It happens.
- Sure, but I mean,

32:37.511 --> 32:40.281
- this came out of nowhere.
- Hey, baby, baby, sorry.

32:40.315 --> 32:43.519
- Can I move this?
- No, you can't move it.

32:44.886 --> 32:46.588
Do you think he cheated?

32:46.622 --> 32:48.324
Theodora, I don't know!

32:48.356 --> 32:50.158
- Do you want me to call and ask?
- Yes.

32:50.192 --> 32:52.795
Please call your ex-girlfriend
and ask her about her divorce.

32:57.798 --> 32:59.801
That house.

32:59.835 --> 33:02.371
Barbecue's Peter's ribs.

33:02.403 --> 33:04.673
Peter's the best cook, right?

33:04.705 --> 33:06.774
I feel like they just moved in.

33:06.807 --> 33:08.844
No, they moved in two years ago,

33:08.876 --> 33:11.913
and in this market, they're not
gonna have trouble selling.

33:11.946 --> 33:15.650
Yeah, I'm sure their realtor
is thrilled.

33:15.683 --> 33:19.888
But it's like
our first friend divorce.

33:19.922 --> 33:21.656
Don't you think it's sad?

33:23.592 --> 33:26.129
It really is.

33:32.968 --> 33:35.403
- So, a deck, huh?
- Yeah.

33:35.436 --> 33:36.671
I've been wanting to build
this thing for...

33:36.704 --> 33:38.740
remember when we moved in here
and I was like,

33:38.773 --> 33:41.776
"I wanna build a deck!"

33:41.809 --> 33:43.511
You remember that?

33:43.545 --> 33:46.215
- It's a big project.
- Mhm.

33:48.282 --> 33:50.385
Okay, well,

33:50.419 --> 33:52.522
don't forget about tonight.

33:58.393 --> 33:59.662
Huh?

33:59.694 --> 34:01.864
Don't forget about tonight.

34:34.695 --> 34:36.199
Raymond, your dog!

34:43.938 --> 34:45.574
Today on Builder Bros,

34:45.606 --> 34:49.612
Brock gets hands on
with your big deck.

34:49.643 --> 34:51.413
What's up, pussies?

34:51.445 --> 34:52.880
Brock here.

34:52.914 --> 34:55.650
So your little lady says
that she likes a small deck,

34:55.684 --> 34:57.820
but come on, bro,
we both know

34:57.853 --> 35:00.755
when you're standing in
your manicured front lawn

35:00.789 --> 35:04.693
sipping on your soy latte
that she is staring

35:04.726 --> 35:07.262
at the sheer girth of my deck.

35:07.295 --> 35:08.529
But that's okay,

35:08.563 --> 35:09.932
'cause Brock Daddy's
here to help.

35:09.965 --> 35:12.300
All right, so you bought
yourself some wood

35:12.333 --> 35:13.668
and you got your tools.

35:13.702 --> 35:15.304
Now what are you waiting for?

35:15.336 --> 35:18.840
Are you staring at that fat pile
like a dope?

35:18.873 --> 35:21.342
Look, deck building is tough.

35:21.376 --> 35:22.511
But relax,

35:22.543 --> 35:26.414
Brock Daddy is gonna hold
both your girly little hands

35:26.447 --> 35:28.483
all the way to the finish line.

35:28.516 --> 35:31.886
So grab some bolts
and some brewskis,

35:31.920 --> 35:33.989
and let's lay some wood.

35:34.021 --> 35:35.523
Oh!

35:37.659 --> 35:38.961
- Mother...
- Fucker.

35:38.994 --> 35:40.461
- What?
- "Hi, Hannah.

35:40.494 --> 35:42.297
Xander has therapy
after baseball camp.

35:42.331 --> 35:44.400
Please give him a snack
beforehand and do not

35:44.432 --> 35:45.900
let him take his scooter
into the session.

35:45.934 --> 35:46.869
Dr. Alberts doesn't like it."

35:46.902 --> 35:49.438
- Ugh, this is so annoying.
- I know, right?

35:49.471 --> 35:51.606
- It's just a scooter.
- "Thanks, Alyssa.

35:51.639 --> 35:53.641
Will do," you fucking bitch.

35:53.675 --> 35:55.577
Whoa, you really laid into her.

35:55.610 --> 35:57.813
Oh my God, no, I did not text
that to Xander's mom.

35:57.846 --> 35:59.882
Xander feels new, what happened
to that kid Jared?

35:59.914 --> 36:01.115
Oh, Jared is a dog I walked

36:01.150 --> 36:03.318
and him and his family are in
the Hamptons for the summer,

36:03.351 --> 36:05.554
along with Persephone
and Maddox's families.

36:05.586 --> 36:08.356
- Oh, those are cute dog names.
- Nope, those are kids.

36:08.389 --> 36:10.958
Wow, you are booked up.

36:10.992 --> 36:14.028
Yeah, if only my bank account
reflected that.

36:14.061 --> 36:16.431
Ugh, life is weird!

36:16.465 --> 36:17.499
Like, this is weird!

36:17.532 --> 36:18.867
Our friend is getting a divorce.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.869
- I know.
- And if somebody had asked me,

36:20.902 --> 36:23.472
like, "Do you think Amy
and Peter will get a divorce?"

36:23.505 --> 36:26.642
- I would've absolutely said no.
- Yes.

36:26.675 --> 36:27.776
Okay, I just lied,

36:27.809 --> 36:28.976
I definitely didn't think
they were gonna make it.

36:29.010 --> 36:29.711
The writing was on the wall.

36:29.744 --> 36:31.113
Remember at Amy's bachelorette?

36:31.146 --> 36:33.015
- She was so unhappy.
- So unhappy,

36:33.047 --> 36:34.750
and it was not because of us,
right?

36:34.782 --> 36:36.351
- It wasn't because of us?
- No!

36:36.385 --> 36:37.820
She was totally off
and not herself,

36:37.853 --> 36:39.755
- and we talked to her about it.
- Yeah.

36:39.788 --> 36:41.556
We were like, "Amy,
what's going on with you?"

36:41.590 --> 36:42.791
"Why are you so unhappy?

36:42.824 --> 36:43.759
What's up?

36:43.791 --> 36:44.860
Why didn't you invite
your cousin Eva?"

36:44.893 --> 36:47.096
- Cousin Eva is an alcoholic.
- And not in a fun way.

36:47.128 --> 36:49.764
And Amy, she was like...

36:49.797 --> 36:52.633
she said...

36:52.666 --> 36:54.536
Okay, so Amy actually
wasn't there for that.

36:54.568 --> 36:55.836
Of course she was there,
it was her bachelorette.

36:55.871 --> 36:59.407
No, no, what we're remembering
is you and I talking about it,

36:59.440 --> 37:02.110
talking about her.

37:02.143 --> 37:04.979
Oh, talking about her
behind her back.

37:05.012 --> 37:07.715
Yeah.

37:07.748 --> 37:10.084
But we've told her in the past
that she seemed unhappy.

37:10.117 --> 37:11.920
Yeah, like when she went
ring shopping alone.

37:11.952 --> 37:13.989
Yes, we said,
"Amy, this is not something

37:14.021 --> 37:14.922
you should be doing
by yourself."

37:14.956 --> 37:16.891
- Yeah, we told her that!
- Yeah, and she said

37:16.925 --> 37:19.562
she was, she was...

37:21.463 --> 37:23.532
She was also not there
for that part either.

37:23.565 --> 37:25.567
That part where we told her
how we really felt?

37:25.599 --> 37:27.635
Yeah, that part.

37:29.938 --> 37:30.972
I'm hungry.

37:31.005 --> 37:31.940
Want a little snack?

37:31.974 --> 37:35.110
I can offer you a pouch,
some cheddar bunnies,

37:35.143 --> 37:37.112
or celery sticks.

37:37.144 --> 37:38.514
Literally just celery sticks?

37:38.547 --> 37:39.648
Not even peanut butter
on the side?

37:39.681 --> 37:41.182
Oh, no, peanuts are legumes

37:41.215 --> 37:43.918
and Xander's mom tries to limit
his legumes.

37:43.952 --> 37:46.522
- Poor Xander.
- I know.

37:52.193 --> 37:53.795
Okay, were,

37:53.829 --> 37:55.531
were we mean to Peter?

37:55.563 --> 37:57.098
No, we were not mean to Peter.

37:57.132 --> 37:58.634
Right.

38:01.902 --> 38:03.838
Okay, so like define mean.

38:03.871 --> 38:05.606
- Like were our jokes mean?
- No.

38:05.639 --> 38:07.141
I mean, maybe our jokes
were mean,

38:07.175 --> 38:08.744
but that doesn't mean
that we were mean.

38:08.777 --> 38:10.646
Right, right, you are so right.

38:10.679 --> 38:11.880
- You get it.
- And plus,

38:11.913 --> 38:13.215
I don't even really think
you can be mean

38:13.248 --> 38:15.016
to somebody that you don't know.

38:15.050 --> 38:16.618
I never really got
to know Peter.

38:16.650 --> 38:18.019
And now we never will.

38:18.052 --> 38:19.989
Tell me about it.

38:22.490 --> 38:24.226
- I miss Amy.
- Me too.

38:24.259 --> 38:26.461
But her not telling us about
the divorce really hurts.

38:26.494 --> 38:28.230
It does, and I mean,
I don't know about you,

38:28.262 --> 38:30.465
but Amy and I talk all the time.

38:30.498 --> 38:33.000
- Same, like, look at my texts.
- Same!

38:33.034 --> 38:35.537
- I text her all the time.
- All the time.

38:35.570 --> 38:39.508
- All the time.
- All the time...

38:39.541 --> 38:41.977
- four months ago.
- Five.

38:47.548 --> 38:48.583
Okay, should we just call her?

38:48.617 --> 38:50.519
Yeah, I feel like we're overdue
for a phone call.

38:50.552 --> 38:52.721
And you know what,
we'll lead with, "We love you."

38:52.753 --> 38:53.822
"We heard about what happened."

38:53.855 --> 38:55.990
"And we wanna let you know
that we are here for you

38:56.023 --> 38:57.992
and we just wanted to say hi."

38:58.025 --> 39:00.895
- I love that.
- Thanks.

39:02.963 --> 39:05.900
- I'm so happy we're doing this.
- Me too.

39:05.934 --> 39:08.537
Hey, it's Amy, leave a message.

39:12.172 --> 39:15.843
- She just...
- Sent us to voicemail, yeah.

39:15.876 --> 39:17.112
That's mean, right?

39:17.144 --> 39:18.746
She's mean, she's mean!

39:18.780 --> 39:20.615
She is mean.

39:22.884 --> 39:25.219
But I guess she is dealing with

39:25.253 --> 39:26.688
- a divorce.
- Divorce.

39:26.721 --> 39:29.291
- Yeah, that's, that's not...
- Not great.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.860
- Oh, it's my Postmates order.
- What'd they say?

39:32.893 --> 39:34.829
"Where the fuck are you?"

39:34.862 --> 39:36.597
- Rude!
- Yeah.

39:36.630 --> 39:37.899
I'm like... what do they mean
where am I?

39:37.932 --> 39:39.835
I'm right here,
I'm clearly busy.

39:39.867 --> 39:40.902
- Yeah.
- Vanessa,

39:40.936 --> 39:41.937
where the fuck are you?

39:41.969 --> 39:43.538
Anderson,
where the fuck are you?

39:43.572 --> 39:45.574
Next to the big green tree.

39:45.606 --> 39:46.842
No, like where are you exactly?

39:46.875 --> 39:48.043
All these trees look the same.

39:48.076 --> 39:49.945
By the... I don't know... elm?

39:49.978 --> 39:51.079
Let's go with elm,
this is an elm.

39:51.112 --> 39:53.848
Um, I don't know what in my life
has led you to believe

39:53.882 --> 39:56.585
that I know what an elm tree
looks like,

39:56.617 --> 39:58.219
- but I don't.
- Vanessa?

39:58.253 --> 39:59.922
- Anderson?
- Vanessa!

39:59.954 --> 40:02.723
- Anderson!
- Vanessa?

40:02.757 --> 40:04.326
Vanessa, Vanessa!

40:04.358 --> 40:06.094
Follow the sound of my voice,

40:06.126 --> 40:07.929
follow the sound of my voice.

40:07.963 --> 40:09.798
Vanessa, Vanessa, Vanessa.

40:09.831 --> 40:10.731
- Anderson!
- Vanessa!

40:10.764 --> 40:12.268
Anderson.

40:14.101 --> 40:16.038
You have to stop yelling
my name.

40:16.070 --> 40:17.639
Gosh, you scared me there.

40:17.672 --> 40:20.141
Whoa, love the Pippi
Longstocking look.

40:20.175 --> 40:22.778
Oh thank you, yeah, I heard that
if you French braid your hair,

40:22.811 --> 40:24.846
it makes you look like
you got a face lift,

40:24.878 --> 40:27.949
and I also recently got
a facelift.

40:27.983 --> 40:29.851
Thanks so much for coming
to Family Day.

40:29.884 --> 40:31.820
Oh, of course, I'm happy to.

40:31.853 --> 40:33.789
Plus, Mom offered me 50 bucks
if I came, so.

40:33.822 --> 40:37.125
- Mm.
- What is Family Day?

40:37.157 --> 40:41.128
Family Day is where the families
of the teens come to visit

40:41.161 --> 40:42.864
and we hike out to Stinson Beach

40:42.896 --> 40:45.032
and discuss our
substance abuse issues,

40:45.065 --> 40:47.201
- I think.
- Okay.

40:47.235 --> 40:49.338
Um, yeah, I really don't want
to do any of that.

40:49.371 --> 40:52.039
- I did just come for the 50.
- Absolutely.

40:52.072 --> 40:54.643
Quick Q, why can't you stop
freeloading off Mom

40:54.675 --> 40:57.244
and start freeloading off your
boyfriend like a normal person?

40:57.277 --> 41:00.014
You know, it's a great Q
and I would counter with,

41:00.047 --> 41:02.149
why can't you stop
freeloading off Mom?

41:02.182 --> 41:03.985
And it's a great counter
and I would say

41:04.018 --> 41:05.753
because I don't have
any other option.

41:05.786 --> 41:09.625
That's why I said yes to this
wilderness rehab retreat thing.

41:09.657 --> 41:11.626
Mom said if I don't complete
this rehab,

41:11.659 --> 41:15.062
that she'd kick me out
and I cannot be homeless at 24...

41:15.096 --> 41:16.731
27...

41:16.764 --> 41:18.666
30.

41:18.699 --> 41:21.168
Well, anyways,
to answer you initial Q,

41:21.202 --> 41:22.904
the reason I can't
freeload off Gabriel

41:22.936 --> 41:24.405
is because something went down

41:24.438 --> 41:26.240
and I don't really wanna
get into the details of it.

41:26.273 --> 41:29.010
But basically when he said no,
I heard him say no

41:29.043 --> 41:30.311
but I didn't hear him say no.

41:30.344 --> 41:31.512
- Do you know what I mean?
- No.

41:31.545 --> 41:33.381
See, like I didn't even
understand what you just said.

41:33.414 --> 41:36.284
Hm, so what happened?

41:44.726 --> 41:48.063
Wow, this is hot.

41:48.096 --> 41:49.764
Smells like soup.

41:49.797 --> 41:53.067
They're scented hot stones.

41:53.101 --> 41:54.702
It's aromatherapy.

42:00.141 --> 42:03.077
Next, I'm going to run ice

42:03.110 --> 42:06.847
down over your body.

42:12.152 --> 42:14.822
Stop shaking,

Are you sure
this is a sex thing?

42:58.867 --> 43:00.469
Just go with it.

43:00.501 --> 43:01.902

43:12.146 --> 43:13.347
We just got started!

43:13.380 --> 43:15.182
I'm down for some freaky shit,

43:15.215 --> 43:17.184
but this doesn't even
feel sexual.

43:17.217 --> 43:19.353
It just feels... ah!

43:19.387 --> 43:20.922
- Dangerous.
- What's your point?

43:20.954 --> 43:22.891
Look, maybe we should
try something

43:22.923 --> 43:24.326
with a little more sex

43:24.358 --> 43:27.261
and a little less honey
in all my crevices.

43:27.295 --> 43:28.896
Okay. Just a little more honey?

43:28.929 --> 43:31.098
No. No! Vanessa!

43:31.132 --> 43:32.300
Okay, let's compromise.

43:32.333 --> 43:33.902
So did you start
taking a lot of baths?

43:33.934 --> 43:36.203
I did. I was taking
two or three a day.

43:36.237 --> 43:37.838
And then my youngest
wanted to get in with me,

43:37.871 --> 43:38.906
and after that, I had to quit.

43:38.940 --> 43:41.443
And I've just...
I've been in a tizzy ever since!

43:41.476 --> 43:43.278
Well, Mary Grace,
we've gotta get you fixed up!

43:43.311 --> 43:44.813
Can't live life
in a tizzy like that.

43:44.846 --> 43:47.114
- Amen!
- So, okay, so how often

43:47.148 --> 43:49.217
are you and Bill,
you know, boning?

43:49.250 --> 43:51.152
Not often enough.

43:51.186 --> 43:52.821
And I wouldn't call it boning,
to be honest,

43:52.853 --> 43:54.822
it's more like
laying down together

43:54.856 --> 43:56.258
and moving for a little bit.

43:56.291 --> 43:57.526
It's just... it's just,

43:57.559 --> 44:00.327
you know, Bill likes things
a certain way.

44:00.360 --> 44:03.197
So we schedule it,
every other Monday.

44:03.231 --> 44:04.566
Missionary Monday is
what we call it,

44:04.599 --> 44:05.700
so we put it in the calendar.

44:05.733 --> 44:06.835
It's like a little code
and that way people see it

44:06.867 --> 44:08.969
and they think, "Oh,
they're doing mission work,"

44:09.003 --> 44:10.071
but it's really just sex

44:10.103 --> 44:13.974
every other Monday at 8:15
after the kids go down.

44:14.007 --> 44:16.277
The same sex, missionary sex.

44:16.311 --> 44:17.445
It's not even the good kind.

44:17.478 --> 44:18.479
Is there a good kind?

44:18.512 --> 44:20.981
Lauren, I just... I can't
continue to be grateful!

44:21.014 --> 44:22.884
It's a sin, it's a lie!

44:22.916 --> 44:24.853
Okay, I mean,
does he at least go down on you?

44:27.856 --> 44:28.924
Lauren!

44:28.956 --> 44:30.257
Honey, you got me rollin'!

44:30.291 --> 44:31.359
No!

44:31.391 --> 44:33.427
Not since 2001.

44:33.460 --> 44:35.296
Listen, when I had
my first child,

44:35.329 --> 44:36.331
he looked me dead in the eye,

44:36.364 --> 44:37.265
and he said, "Listen,
I can't go down there

44:37.298 --> 44:39.400
after I saw my daughter
come out of there."

44:39.434 --> 44:42.037
You know, she was
an 11-pound baby, but still.

44:42.070 --> 44:43.238
Okay, you know what, Mary Grace?

44:43.271 --> 44:44.172
No, fuck this guy.

44:44.206 --> 44:46.942
He needs to get down there
and get busy!

44:46.974 --> 44:49.243
You know what, I agree!

44:49.277 --> 44:52.146
I've been doing my exercises
for years now!

44:52.179 --> 44:55.884
Lord, on the wings of Jesus,
I'm sharing my story!

44:55.916 --> 44:57.219
Okay, wow, okay!

44:57.251 --> 44:59.153
Yes, cheers to that, Mary Grace!

44:59.186 --> 45:02.489
Cheers to that.

45:02.523 --> 45:04.125
Hold on, I'ma be right back.

45:04.157 --> 45:05.559
Woo! I feel alive today!

45:05.592 --> 45:06.627
Jesus is real!

45:06.661 --> 45:08.864
What the fuck?

45:10.164 --> 45:13.101
Okay, so...

45:13.134 --> 45:14.603
I went to the paint and sip,
all right,

45:14.635 --> 45:16.103
and I didn't want
to paint the hydrangeas

45:16.137 --> 45:17.038
that were in
the sample painting,

45:17.072 --> 45:17.939
'cause I've already
done that, okay?

45:17.972 --> 45:19.608
I've got two bushes
in my backyard.

45:19.641 --> 45:21.276
So the instructor said to me,
she goes,

45:21.309 --> 45:24.112
"Just paint what calls to you."

45:24.144 --> 45:27.114
So I painted something,
it's a little wild,

45:27.148 --> 45:30.117
and I just... I've been
too afraid to show Bill,

45:30.150 --> 45:31.353
I've been hiding it
under my bed,

45:31.385 --> 45:33.021
but I wanna show you.

45:33.054 --> 45:34.456
Okay, now keep in mind,

45:34.489 --> 45:36.057
I had spent some time
in the jacuzzi tub

45:36.090 --> 45:38.927
before I went.

45:38.960 --> 45:40.095
Here it is.

45:40.128 --> 45:41.963
It's a self-portrait.

45:41.996 --> 45:44.266
Oh, my God, wow!

45:44.298 --> 45:46.668
I mean, the writing
was on the wall.

45:46.701 --> 45:48.469
He's not a rich man,
and she's...

45:48.503 --> 45:50.171
I don't know, pretty-ish.

45:50.204 --> 45:52.173
So, really, all they had
keeping their marriage together

45:52.206 --> 45:53.909
was love?

45:55.342 --> 45:57.111
And I know you know this
better than anyone, babe,

45:57.144 --> 45:58.179
'cause we're so good together,

45:58.213 --> 46:01.048
that a healthy relationship
is a tête-à-tête

46:01.081 --> 46:03.417
of wit
and emotional communication.

46:03.451 --> 46:06.688
Without it, you have nothing.

46:06.721 --> 46:08.523
Unless, of course, obviously,
one of you has stock

46:08.556 --> 46:10.692
or Bitcoin
or a beachside property.

46:10.724 --> 46:12.493
But even then, you know,
it's a give and a take.

46:12.527 --> 46:14.295
- Don't you agree?
- Do you wanna stretch me or...

46:14.329 --> 46:17.465
Equity and communication.

46:17.498 --> 46:20.001
It's a give and a take.

46:20.034 --> 46:21.469
Oh, give me that.

46:21.501 --> 46:22.202
You know what I mean?

46:22.235 --> 46:24.138
It's like a back and a forth.

46:24.172 --> 46:25.673
Here's the thing
about Amy and Peter,

46:25.706 --> 46:27.275
they were never equal.

46:27.307 --> 46:29.543
She always wore the pants
in the relationship.

46:29.577 --> 46:31.046
Do you remember last summer
when they were in town

46:31.079 --> 46:31.947
and we went to Jones?

46:31.980 --> 46:33.347
And the waitress
dropped the check off

46:33.380 --> 46:35.983
in front of Amy.

46:36.016 --> 46:38.118
Amy, not Peter.

46:38.152 --> 46:39.721
I mean, how humiliating,

46:39.753 --> 46:41.722
and not just for her, for him.

46:41.755 --> 46:43.524
So emasculating.

46:43.557 --> 46:45.393
Oh, my God, honey, no.

46:45.425 --> 46:47.461
Somebody's gonna see you,
you look like a wimp.

46:47.494 --> 46:49.130
Your arms are like
tiny SpongeBob arms

46:49.163 --> 46:51.465
and you have the body
of Kermit the Frog.

46:51.498 --> 46:54.601
You should really call
my trainer!

46:54.635 --> 46:56.071
Crunches.

46:56.103 --> 46:57.638
Now, gentlemen,

46:57.672 --> 47:00.108
I understand that sometimes

47:00.141 --> 47:02.309
some of these porcupine memories

47:02.342 --> 47:03.711
are hard to get rid of,

47:03.744 --> 47:07.248
and simply yelling them away
is not enough.

47:07.280 --> 47:11.219
That's why the last thing
we're gonna learn today

47:11.251 --> 47:14.621
will require
a more aggressive approach.

47:14.655 --> 47:17.525
Bam! Fireworks!

47:17.557 --> 47:20.195
This here is the cobra box.

47:20.228 --> 47:23.398
The cobra can hypnotize
its prey

47:23.431 --> 47:26.266
before launching for the kill.

47:26.300 --> 47:30.638
So, inside this box
is a bunch of crap

47:30.670 --> 47:34.174
that my ex used to own
and that hypnotizes me

47:34.208 --> 47:37.479
into doing stuff
I really don't want to do

47:37.512 --> 47:41.048
like text her or call her
or drive up to her place

47:41.081 --> 47:44.485
and see her go in
and out of her apartment

47:44.518 --> 47:48.489
with a random guy that may
or may not be her new boyfriend.

47:48.523 --> 47:49.490
We don't know.

47:49.523 --> 47:52.059
What we do know is
that he owns a new Tesla.

47:52.092 --> 47:54.261
I know it's new,
because it's the new model.

47:56.264 --> 48:00.068
And we can't keep doing that
to ourselves.

48:00.101 --> 48:04.204
Time to destroy the cobra box,
trademark... not granted,

48:04.237 --> 48:06.507
because I guess there's
a company in Australia

48:06.541 --> 48:08.676
that sells cobras in a box.

48:08.708 --> 48:12.480
All right, let's get to it.

48:12.512 --> 48:15.382
Time to reclaim
the space in our hearts.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.202
Well, that was disappointing.

48:35.670 --> 48:37.605
Oh, my gosh.

48:37.637 --> 48:40.107
Oh, my gosh, what am I doing?

48:40.141 --> 48:42.077
What is the matter with me?

48:42.110 --> 48:44.345
It's like I turned 38
and I went crazy!

48:44.378 --> 48:45.547
I'm like a horndog!

48:45.579 --> 48:47.114
I just... I gotta burn this.

48:47.148 --> 48:49.084
No, no, no. Mary Grace, no.

48:49.117 --> 48:50.518
You listen to me, okay?

48:50.550 --> 48:54.154
We were not raised
to talk about sex or want it,

48:54.188 --> 48:56.257
but we do,
and that is great, okay?

48:56.289 --> 48:57.659
So you just need
to get out there,

48:57.692 --> 48:59.527
and you need to tell Bill
what you want.

48:59.559 --> 49:01.563
Well, I mean, do you tell men
what you want?

49:01.596 --> 49:02.797
Hell, yeah! Hell, yeah, I do!

49:02.829 --> 49:04.465
There's a fucking
orgasm epidemic

49:04.498 --> 49:05.532
in this country, okay?

49:05.565 --> 49:08.135
And we must demand action.

49:08.168 --> 49:09.237
- Heck, yeah.
- Right?

49:09.269 --> 49:10.804
Heck, yeah, I'm gonna do that!

49:10.838 --> 49:13.173
There he is. Bill! Bill!

49:13.206 --> 49:14.208
- Oh.
- Bill!

49:14.242 --> 49:15.243
No, no, no, no, no, wait.

49:15.275 --> 49:16.577
Yes, I'm talking to you!

49:16.610 --> 49:17.411
I have needs!

49:17.445 --> 49:18.746
Maybe not in front of me,
though.

49:18.778 --> 49:20.114
- Maybe not in front of me.
- Hey, Bill!

49:20.148 --> 49:24.619
I need you to lick
this front tushy!

49:24.652 --> 49:25.720
I just did the Lord's work.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.596
I can't believe
I'm in the mountains

49:35.630 --> 49:36.764
and I'm not on mushrooms.

49:36.797 --> 49:38.565
- This is a first for me.
- I know,

49:38.599 --> 49:40.668
that must be so hard for you.

49:40.701 --> 49:43.570
- And for you.
- Hm?

49:43.603 --> 49:44.771
Are you on mushrooms?

49:44.804 --> 49:45.739
I don't think I...

49:45.773 --> 49:47.876
I don't think
I understand the question.

49:47.909 --> 49:49.611
I think you do.

49:49.643 --> 49:51.578
But weirdly, I'm getting
like a sobriety high

49:51.612 --> 49:53.248
- from being clean!
- Is that true?

49:53.280 --> 49:54.114
- No.
- Yeah.

49:54.148 --> 49:56.217
But at least my life
is going better

49:56.250 --> 49:57.418
than Amy and Peter's.

49:57.451 --> 49:59.721
I mean, thank God someone's life
is going worse than ours!

49:59.753 --> 50:01.788
Yeah. But is it?

50:01.822 --> 50:03.525
'Cause like, you still live
at home with Mom,

50:03.557 --> 50:05.893
and I just ruined
another relationship.

50:05.927 --> 50:09.164
God, my 16-year-old self
would 100% bully me.

50:09.197 --> 50:11.932
Oh, my 16-year-old self
would definitely make me cry.

50:11.965 --> 50:14.735
She'd probably Photoshop my face
onto the body of a whale

50:14.768 --> 50:16.303
and have it printed
onto T-shirts

50:16.336 --> 50:17.838
for everyone in the class
to wear.

50:17.871 --> 50:18.906
Specific.

50:20.541 --> 50:21.910
You know what I'm realizing?

50:21.943 --> 50:23.711
Amy and Peter are
getting a divorce,

50:23.744 --> 50:25.713
which means they're gonna
have to be single again.

50:25.746 --> 50:28.316
I am currently single,
so if you really think about it,

50:28.349 --> 50:29.417
it's almost like I found

50:29.449 --> 50:32.319
some sort of cheat code
or shortcut.

50:32.353 --> 50:33.288
Yeah.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.190
Or is it like they found
somebody to love them,

50:36.224 --> 50:37.692
marry them,
and then divorce them

50:37.724 --> 50:40.694
all before we found anyone
to love us.

50:40.728 --> 50:43.463
- Is it worse?
- Or is it better?

50:43.496 --> 50:44.865
- It's probably worse.
- I think it's worse.

50:44.898 --> 50:46.500
- Worse.
- It is worse.

50:47.735 --> 50:50.805
Oh, oh, my God. Where are we?

50:50.838 --> 50:52.707
Are we... are we lost?

50:52.739 --> 50:53.907
Where are the other campers?

50:53.940 --> 50:55.342
Is that what you call them,
"campers"?

50:55.376 --> 50:58.646
- Tiny drug addicts?
- Troubled teens?

50:58.679 --> 51:01.215
- Oh, my God, we are lost.
- Oh, my God!

51:01.248 --> 51:02.382
Spread out!

51:07.621 --> 51:09.790
All right, crack open
another cold one,

51:09.824 --> 51:11.291
'cause you deserve it.

51:11.324 --> 51:13.594
Brock Daddy is so proud of you!

51:13.628 --> 51:15.763
Only six more videos
till you've got yourself

51:15.795 --> 51:18.398
a brand new deck.

52:12.719 --> 52:14.621
There you are.

52:20.960 --> 52:21.962
Oh!

52:34.041 --> 52:36.010
I love your deck.

52:39.612 --> 52:40.881
Shh.

52:40.914 --> 52:46.788
Shhhh.

53:14.514 --> 53:16.049
What the fuck?

53:16.083 --> 53:18.119
♪ I can't get you off my mind ♪

53:18.152 --> 53:19.787
Nice spread!

53:19.820 --> 53:20.653
'Gram worthy.

53:20.688 --> 53:22.890
I know, I don't skimp
on the sush.

53:22.922 --> 53:24.858
I wonder how long it's been
since this was made.

53:26.960 --> 53:28.395
Beer. You guys want some beer?

53:28.429 --> 53:30.764
- Sure!
- Yeah, I'll take two.

53:30.797 --> 53:31.699
Maybe!

53:34.735 --> 53:36.570
So, I'm so glad
that we got to hang out!

53:36.603 --> 53:37.971
Kai's told me
so much about you.

53:38.005 --> 53:39.407
Yeah, I mean,
he's my best friend,

53:39.440 --> 53:40.240
so that makes a lot of sense.

53:40.273 --> 53:41.742
Listen, you know
so much about me,

53:41.775 --> 53:43.478
but I don't really know
anything about you,

53:43.510 --> 53:44.878
which seems unfair.

53:44.911 --> 53:46.012
Where are you from?

53:46.045 --> 53:47.547
Boston, where are you from?

53:47.581 --> 53:49.150
What do your parents do?

53:49.182 --> 53:51.119
Oh, uh, my mom's
an occupational therapist

53:51.152 --> 53:52.854
and my dad works
for a mineral company.

53:52.887 --> 53:55.856
- Are they still together?
- My parents?

53:55.889 --> 53:57.023
No, actually, they split up.

53:57.056 --> 53:58.825
- How old were you?
- Eleven.

53:58.858 --> 54:01.061
Ah, so you come
from a broken family.

54:01.094 --> 54:03.764
Um, I mean,
I wouldn't say "broken."

54:03.797 --> 54:05.966
It was fine. Two Christmases.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.635
So you're a Christian,
and you're in denial.

54:07.668 --> 54:08.501
Got it, okay.

54:08.536 --> 54:10.104
So would you say
that your upbringing

54:10.137 --> 54:11.472
has had some sort of impact

54:11.505 --> 54:13.641
on your current thoughts
on commitment?

54:13.673 --> 54:15.108
- What?
- Do you like to get serious?

54:15.141 --> 54:17.844
Or do you just
keep things "casual"?

54:17.878 --> 54:20.047
I'm sorry,
what's happening here.

54:20.079 --> 54:23.784
Cervezas! One for you,
and one for you.

54:23.818 --> 54:25.620
- Thank you!
- Check it out, Mexican beer,

54:25.652 --> 54:27.120
Japanese sushi,
what can I say?

54:27.153 --> 54:28.623
I'm giving you guys
a world tour.

54:30.224 --> 54:32.860
- You're cute.
- Isn't he the best? Yeah.

54:32.893 --> 54:35.496
So, uh, how many dates
have you guys been on?

54:35.528 --> 54:38.032
Uh, technically,
this is our third.

54:38.065 --> 54:39.634
- Technically?
- Well, one night,

54:39.666 --> 54:40.701
we just watched Tiger King,

54:40.735 --> 54:43.204
so I don't know
if that counts as a real date.

54:43.237 --> 54:45.139
Yeah, I mean,
it sounds pretty...

54:45.172 --> 54:47.007
casual.

54:47.041 --> 54:49.677
- I thought it was romantic.
- Then we'll count it.

54:49.710 --> 54:51.913
- Count it!
- Count it!

54:51.945 --> 54:53.780
- Kill me.
- I've said it once,

54:53.813 --> 54:54.882
and I'll say it again.

54:54.914 --> 54:55.715
There are two things

54:55.748 --> 54:57.717
that will never work
in a marriage.

54:57.751 --> 54:59.687
One, the woman
wearing the pants,

54:59.719 --> 55:01.988
two, the woman being
a motherly figure.

55:02.021 --> 55:03.958
Oh, honey.

55:03.990 --> 55:05.460
I just think,
at the end of the day,

55:05.492 --> 55:07.894
it's like love and marriage,
it's just...

55:07.927 --> 55:09.896
I know you know this now,
'cause I've told you,

55:09.929 --> 55:11.765
- it's like...
- Shut up!

55:11.798 --> 55:13.134
Shut the fuck up!

55:13.166 --> 55:16.103
Seriously,
shut your fucking mouth.

55:16.135 --> 55:18.773
Holy hell,
do you ever stop talking?

55:18.806 --> 55:21.242
All you do is talk
and talk and talk,

55:21.275 --> 55:23.478
and I'm starting to feel like
I live in a fucking hell prison

55:23.510 --> 55:25.045
of your fucking voice!

55:25.079 --> 55:26.781
Fuck!

55:40.193 --> 55:46.701
I have never in my life...

55:48.135 --> 55:51.873
been more attracted to you.

55:54.675 --> 55:58.012
We're going home
and straight to the bedroom.

55:58.045 --> 55:59.880
Pick up all this shit.

56:02.949 --> 56:04.085
- So rude.
- Oh, my God!

56:04.117 --> 56:07.054
- Is that...
- Maya!

56:07.086 --> 56:08.755
Oh, my God, wow.

56:08.789 --> 56:10.291
- Do we have to say hi?
- Well, now we fucking do!

56:10.324 --> 56:13.628
- Hi!
- Hannah! T.Y.!

56:13.661 --> 56:14.929
You guys look...

56:17.597 --> 56:18.365
great!

56:18.398 --> 56:21.268
Holy shit,
how long has it been?

56:21.302 --> 56:22.803
I mean, I don't think
we've seen each other

56:22.835 --> 56:24.971
since Amy and Peter's wedding.

56:25.005 --> 56:26.840
- Oh.
- So you heard.

56:26.873 --> 56:29.543
Of course.
I was shocked to my core.

56:29.577 --> 56:32.280
- It was very upsetting.
- A tragedy.

56:36.784 --> 56:39.820
- So I should be going.
- Yes. Yes, go!

56:39.853 --> 56:41.856
- We're gonna...
- Babe, come on.

56:41.889 --> 56:43.024
Okay, kiss kiss!

56:43.056 --> 56:45.157
See ya! Bye, Maya!

56:46.960 --> 56:48.929
If I never see her again,
it'll only be too soon.

56:48.963 --> 56:50.698
I know, she stresses me out!

56:50.731 --> 56:52.733
Me too, let's breathe.

56:55.936 --> 56:57.238
Stay calm, stay calm!

56:57.271 --> 56:59.807
Think peaceful thoughts,
think Elle Fanning.

56:59.840 --> 57:02.076
What? Why would you make me
think of Elle Fanning?

57:02.108 --> 57:03.610
That only makes me think
of Dakota Fanning

57:03.643 --> 57:05.211
who used to be more famous
than her sister,

57:05.244 --> 57:07.114
- and now she's not!
- Okay, okay.

57:07.146 --> 57:10.083
Think pizza, pasta,
sweet treats!

57:10.117 --> 57:13.220
Cellulite, fat, fuck,
I need to lose 50 pounds.

57:13.253 --> 57:15.789
- Help!
- Someone save me!

57:15.822 --> 57:17.891
- I mean, us!
- We need to take shelter!

57:17.925 --> 57:19.093
Quick, give me a boost!

57:19.126 --> 57:20.227
Oh, so you can leave me
down here

57:20.260 --> 57:21.996
to be eaten by wild dogs?

57:22.028 --> 57:23.931
You'll be fine,
your blood is toxic!

57:23.963 --> 57:25.231
Dogs can sense that!

57:27.134 --> 57:29.170
Oh, bad vibes, we have to run!

57:29.202 --> 57:30.271
- I have the runs?
- What?

57:30.304 --> 57:31.639
No, we have to run!

57:31.672 --> 57:33.740
- Come on!
- Oh, my God!

57:38.646 --> 57:39.914
This is it.

57:39.947 --> 57:42.215
We're in 127 Hours.

57:42.248 --> 57:44.851
Except for it's not gonna
take that long for me to die.

57:44.885 --> 57:46.153
I'm not a survivor.

57:46.186 --> 57:49.222
- And I know that.
- I am starving to death!

57:49.255 --> 57:52.359
I can literally feel my body
eating itself alive.

57:52.393 --> 57:53.994
I'm so thirsty!

57:54.027 --> 57:55.629
I need water.

57:55.663 --> 57:57.365
Or Diet Coke
or a Vodka Red Bull.

57:57.398 --> 57:59.400
I always knew I'd die
on the set of Lord of the Rings

57:59.432 --> 58:03.971
- with orcs all around me.
- I'm not an orc!

58:05.672 --> 58:07.674
I always thought I'd die young,

58:07.708 --> 58:09.644
and I'm not even that young.

58:09.677 --> 58:11.846
I can't even get
my own tragic death right!

58:11.878 --> 58:14.214
We should find a pretty place
to lay our bones down

58:14.248 --> 58:16.349
for the final rest.

58:16.382 --> 58:18.251
We need shade.

58:18.284 --> 58:21.355
Here, take this rock
and protect us

58:21.387 --> 58:24.025
from the indigenous people
of this land.

58:24.057 --> 58:25.358
Ooh, I don't actually think

58:25.391 --> 58:26.993
there are indigenous people
here anymore.

58:27.027 --> 58:28.896
And whose fault is that,
Anderson?

58:28.929 --> 58:31.731
I'm so weak.

58:31.764 --> 58:33.933
I can feel the life
draining from my eyes.

58:33.967 --> 58:36.436
Here, sketch a message
into the mud

58:36.469 --> 58:38.972
so that future generations
will know we were here.

58:44.010 --> 58:45.846
Hey, guys?

58:45.878 --> 58:47.815
We really wanna
keep it down here.

58:47.847 --> 58:50.250
We're trying to share the forest
with everyone, okay?

58:50.284 --> 58:52.019
- We're saved!
- A gnome.

58:52.052 --> 58:54.989
No, this is my ginger
rehab counselor.

58:55.021 --> 58:56.356
I think the mushrooms just hit.

58:56.389 --> 58:58.224
I'm J.P., we've met,
and you guys

58:58.257 --> 59:00.093
have literally been
five feet from the trail

59:00.126 --> 59:02.462
this entire time.

59:02.496 --> 59:05.398
- Well, the trail...
- I mean, that's the arrow...

59:05.431 --> 59:07.867
Trail signs
might as well be written

59:07.900 --> 59:10.236
in Egyptian hierologlyphics.

59:10.269 --> 59:11.304
Right.

59:11.338 --> 59:13.441
Anderson, we're gonna have
to ask your sister

59:13.474 --> 59:14.975
to leave the retreat.

59:15.007 --> 59:16.843
You know that she's not
supposed to be here,

59:16.876 --> 59:19.079
especially after
what happened last time.

59:19.112 --> 59:21.014
- Oh, come on.
- How was I supposed to know

59:21.047 --> 59:23.950
you're not allowed to bring
ecstasy to a rehab picnic?

59:23.983 --> 59:25.418
- The kids loved it!
- Calico.

59:25.452 --> 59:27.221
March.

59:27.253 --> 59:28.188
I'm serious.

59:42.936 --> 59:44.138
Ha-ha!

01:00:50.003 --> 01:00:51.072
Ah!

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:04.117
Oh, my God. Sam!

01:01:06.186 --> 01:01:07.988
Fuck you, dog!

01:01:12.525 --> 01:01:14.494
Ow, ow.

01:01:14.527 --> 01:01:16.129
Get up, get up.

01:01:17.530 --> 01:01:18.565
Sit.

01:01:20.199 --> 01:01:21.335
Stop whining.

01:01:23.302 --> 01:01:25.405
Just hold it still.

01:01:25.438 --> 01:01:26.940
Ow, okay.

01:01:26.974 --> 01:01:27.875
Okay.

01:01:27.907 --> 01:01:29.175
Ow, ow!

01:01:29.208 --> 01:01:31.978
Ow!

01:01:32.012 --> 01:01:33.847
Gah.

01:01:37.016 --> 01:01:38.952
- Is that just house tape?
- Yup.

01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:40.954
Ow. Ah!

01:01:44.391 --> 01:01:46.594
- I...
- Your thumb is mangled.

01:01:46.626 --> 01:01:48.628
- It hurts.
- Good.

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.230
Because it means
your nerves are intact

01:01:50.264 --> 01:01:52.032
and because you also deserve it.

01:01:52.065 --> 01:01:55.369
What? I deserve it?

01:01:55.402 --> 01:01:57.471
What are you even doing
out here all day?

01:01:57.503 --> 01:01:59.406
- Huh?
- Deserve what?

01:02:01.574 --> 01:02:03.376
We had plans, Sam!

01:02:06.579 --> 01:02:09.016
- Fuck.
- Yeah.

01:02:11.585 --> 01:02:14.454
You're right.

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:17.625
Babe, you really
should have said something.

01:02:17.657 --> 01:02:20.594
- Oh, should I have?
- Yeah.

01:02:20.626 --> 01:02:22.295
- I think...
- Yeah?

01:02:22.329 --> 01:02:24.231
Oh! Ow!

01:02:24.264 --> 01:02:25.466
Jesus!

01:02:27.567 --> 01:02:32.005
I am... I am always the one.

01:02:35.041 --> 01:02:38.011
I am always picking you up.

01:02:38.045 --> 01:02:39.547
Always!

01:02:43.282 --> 01:02:44.951
Why?

01:02:51.425 --> 01:02:53.527
You slapped me really hard.

01:02:53.559 --> 01:02:55.663
You don't think I know
what this is about?

01:02:55.695 --> 01:02:59.365
Who this is about?

01:02:59.398 --> 01:03:00.300
Yeah.

01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:02.536
- What?
- Yeah.

01:03:02.568 --> 01:03:04.438
No!

01:03:04.471 --> 01:03:06.106
You're...

01:03:06.139 --> 01:03:08.442
I wanted to do something.

01:03:08.474 --> 01:03:10.443
To make something.

01:03:10.476 --> 01:03:11.444
With these!

01:03:13.612 --> 01:03:15.648
So poetic.

01:03:17.117 --> 01:03:18.986
God!

01:03:19.018 --> 01:03:20.453
- You...
- Ow!

01:03:20.487 --> 01:03:24.592
...you sheet of fucking glass!

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:28.362
What?

01:03:28.394 --> 01:03:30.197
Theo, where are you going?

01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:32.432
I have plans, Sam.

01:03:32.465 --> 01:03:34.201
Lots of them.

01:03:45.778 --> 01:03:47.547
Shhh.

01:03:51.217 --> 01:03:52.185
Hello?

01:03:54.487 --> 01:03:56.523
- Raymond?
- Building something?

01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:01.095
Yeah, a deck.

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:02.063
How long you been there?

01:04:02.096 --> 01:04:04.398
- Wife troubles?
- No, she's my fiancée.

01:04:04.431 --> 01:04:07.300
- What did you say?
- Fiancée.

01:04:07.333 --> 01:04:10.103
No, no, what did you do?

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:12.306
Oh.

01:04:12.338 --> 01:04:14.240
It's complicated.

01:04:14.273 --> 01:04:15.742
We'll be all right.

01:04:21.148 --> 01:04:24.485
You know, it's just this girl
I used to date.

01:04:24.518 --> 01:04:26.220
She's married,
but she's getting a divorce now,

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:27.388
it's stupid.

01:04:31.157 --> 01:04:34.293
- What's so funny?
- Oh.

01:04:34.327 --> 01:04:35.730
You still love this girl?

01:04:38.297 --> 01:04:39.632
I don't think it's about that.

01:04:39.666 --> 01:04:41.568
- Casual dalliance then?
- What?

01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:43.503
- Left-handed honeymoon?
- What?

01:04:43.536 --> 01:04:45.739
Do you want to sleep with her?

01:04:45.771 --> 01:04:48.174
No! No.

01:04:48.208 --> 01:04:50.811
Ray, I have a fiancée.

01:04:50.844 --> 01:04:52.679
Yeah, you said that already.

01:04:52.711 --> 01:04:56.182
Yeah. I did.

01:04:56.215 --> 01:04:58.719
Yeah, by the sound of it,
you still do.

01:04:58.751 --> 01:05:00.420
Take it from me, kid.

01:05:00.454 --> 01:05:02.423
You get the beginning,
you get the end,

01:05:02.456 --> 01:05:05.224
and usually, the only thing
separating the two

01:05:05.257 --> 01:05:06.359
is a lot of wasted time.

01:05:06.393 --> 01:05:08.561
Hey, Ray?

01:05:08.594 --> 01:05:09.829
Are you good with this stuff?

01:05:09.862 --> 01:05:12.432
- Women?
- No, lumber.

01:05:12.465 --> 01:05:13.733
I know a thing or two.

01:05:15.469 --> 01:05:17.304
- Can you teach me?
- Oh, sure!

01:05:17.336 --> 01:05:19.273
You just hit the nail
on the head.

01:05:19.306 --> 01:05:20.574
No.

01:05:22.842 --> 01:05:25.545
I mean, would you come over here
and help me build it?

01:05:25.579 --> 01:05:27.581
Ah!

01:05:27.614 --> 01:05:29.416
No.

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:31.751
- No?
- No, don't got the time.

01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:34.353
- Tomorrow then!
- Nope, can't!

01:05:34.387 --> 01:05:38.158
- Why?
- Well, you're an asshole

01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:40.093
to my dog.

01:05:41.862 --> 01:05:44.697
Well, why didn't you
say anything then?

01:05:44.731 --> 01:05:48.569
Son, I was in the war.

01:05:50.202 --> 01:05:51.338
Oh.

01:05:54.173 --> 01:05:55.342
Thank you.

01:06:25.304 --> 01:06:27.140
Wow, four dates!

01:06:27.173 --> 01:06:29.275
You guys are getting
pretty serious.

01:06:29.309 --> 01:06:32.179
You guys gonna meet
each other's parents soon?

01:06:32.211 --> 01:06:32.913
Um...

01:06:34.581 --> 01:06:37.651
I don't know what it is
about eating outside.

01:06:37.684 --> 01:06:39.486
I mean, it just... the food
just tastes better.

01:06:39.518 --> 01:06:42.355
- Alcohol tastes better, too!
- So true.

01:06:42.389 --> 01:06:44.791
- Fuck, I forgot the limes!
- No, that's okay!

01:06:44.824 --> 01:06:46.460
No, I have a whole bag,
and they're really old,

01:06:46.492 --> 01:06:47.393
and if we don't use them,
they're gonna go bad.

01:06:47.427 --> 01:06:50.263
- I can get them.
- No, I'll be right back.

01:06:50.297 --> 01:06:51.831
So what are your intentions
with Kai?

01:06:51.864 --> 01:06:54.634
- What?
- Kai is fragile, okay?

01:06:54.668 --> 01:06:56.803
And if you're not in it
for the long haul,

01:06:56.835 --> 01:06:59.639
I'm talking holding hands
and dying in bed together...

01:06:59.672 --> 01:07:01.207
- Like The Notebook?
- Please do not

01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.442
bring that film up right now.

01:07:02.474 --> 01:07:03.643
I cannot handle that, okay?

01:07:03.675 --> 01:07:06.846
Anyways, if you're here
to just have fun or something,

01:07:06.880 --> 01:07:08.182
then you might as well leave now

01:07:08.215 --> 01:07:09.350
and spare us
all the heartbreak, okay?

01:07:09.382 --> 01:07:12.785
- Dude, what is your deal?
- Are you seeing other guys?

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:13.686
- Are you clean?
- Excuse me?

01:07:13.719 --> 01:07:15.655
- Sexually.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

01:07:15.688 --> 01:07:17.324
When's the last time
you had unprotected sex?

01:07:17.356 --> 01:07:19.393
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, bad news.

01:07:19.425 --> 01:07:21.194
Motherfucking knew it,
limes are old.

01:07:21.228 --> 01:07:22.729
Good news, neighbor said
we could borrow some of theirs.

01:07:22.762 --> 01:07:23.897
- I'll be right back.
- Please don't go!

01:07:23.929 --> 01:07:24.797
- Be right back!
- I just don't think

01:07:24.831 --> 01:07:26.466
- you're right for each other.
- Dude!

01:07:26.498 --> 01:07:27.567
I mean, do you even want kids?

01:07:27.601 --> 01:07:28.869
I don't know, maybe one day!

01:07:28.902 --> 01:07:30.670
"Maybe one day!" Unbelievable.

01:07:30.704 --> 01:07:32.573
- I'm 21!
- Yeah, my mom had me

01:07:32.606 --> 01:07:34.775
- when she was 23.
- Well, times have changed!

01:07:34.807 --> 01:07:38.612
Times have changed, because now
commitment doesn't matter!

01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:39.813
Marriage doesn't mean anything!

01:07:39.846 --> 01:07:41.481
This is all just
a bunch of bullshit!

01:07:41.514 --> 01:07:42.782
And whatever you're here to do,

01:07:42.815 --> 01:07:43.916
okay, it's just
not gonna work out,

01:07:43.951 --> 01:07:45.818
so you might as well leave
before somebody gets hurt!

01:07:45.851 --> 01:07:49.489
Fine!

01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:51.557
You know, I don't know
what I did or said

01:07:51.590 --> 01:07:52.826
to make you hate me,

01:07:52.858 --> 01:07:54.927
but this conversation
is fucked up.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.262
You guys can have each other.

01:07:56.295 --> 01:07:58.898
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- I can't handle your roommate!

01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:01.434
I am so sorry,
but he's just been having

01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:02.536
a really shitty day.

01:08:02.568 --> 01:08:05.371
He found out that his sister
is getting a divorce.

01:08:05.405 --> 01:08:07.708
- Really?
- Yeah, I just found out.

01:08:09.541 --> 01:08:10.943
I'm sorry.

01:08:10.976 --> 01:08:12.245
No, I'm sorry.

01:08:12.278 --> 01:08:14.447
I've acted like such a dick.

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.283
It's just this whole thing
is fucking with me, you know?

01:08:16.314 --> 01:08:19.417
Like I always thought
that love was real.

01:08:19.452 --> 01:08:20.685
Love is real.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:23.724
I mean, sometimes it's scary
and it doesn't work out,

01:08:23.756 --> 01:08:26.893
but it's definitely real.

01:08:26.926 --> 01:08:29.729
Yeah, man, just hang in there.

01:08:29.761 --> 01:08:31.899
Things will sort themselves out.

01:08:35.068 --> 01:08:36.603
Do you guys think
we should have a threesome?

01:08:36.636 --> 01:08:39.939
♪ I can't get you off my mind ♪

01:08:41.307 --> 01:08:43.710
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph,
I did it!

01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:45.812
- I did it.
- Did sex?

01:08:45.845 --> 01:08:47.779
Yes, with Bill.

01:08:47.814 --> 01:08:49.783
A ton. He loves it.

01:08:49.814 --> 01:08:51.716
He's even got a name
for my front tushy.

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:53.453
Calls it the "open road."

01:08:53.484 --> 01:08:55.889
Okay, that's sweet, yeah.

01:08:55.921 --> 01:09:00.660
And girl, did he drive
down the open road!

01:09:00.694 --> 01:09:01.962
Woo!

01:09:01.993 --> 01:09:03.962
Did you know that sex
on a trampoline

01:09:03.997 --> 01:09:05.499
is a weightless gift?

01:09:05.532 --> 01:09:08.033
I did not know that,
but good to know, thank you!

01:09:08.068 --> 01:09:09.636
Got a little tramp burn
on my belly,

01:09:09.667 --> 01:09:12.037
but it was worth it.

01:09:12.072 --> 01:09:14.041
Girl, I'm getting to tour
my house and home

01:09:14.073 --> 01:09:16.076
like I've never seen it before!

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.312
And Bill says he's awake
for the first time

01:09:18.345 --> 01:09:20.046
since W. got elected!

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:23.817
Okay, well, listen, Mary Grace,
I am so happy for you,

01:09:23.850 --> 01:09:25.085
and I guess for Bill, too.

01:09:25.118 --> 01:09:27.421
I cannot thank you enough.

01:09:27.453 --> 01:09:29.854
I am sending you
an Edible Arrangement today.

01:09:29.889 --> 01:09:31.992
No, no, no, no, don't do that,
that's not necessary.

01:09:32.024 --> 01:09:33.393
It's already done!

01:09:33.426 --> 01:09:34.995
I got your address
from your mother.

01:09:35.028 --> 01:09:38.432
And don't you worry, I told her
you were well-acquainted

01:09:38.465 --> 01:09:40.734
with the men in town,
and rest assured...

01:09:40.765 --> 01:09:42.769
Wait, wait, wait,
you told my mom what?

01:09:42.801 --> 01:09:44.069
- What, Bill?
- Mary Grace,

01:09:44.104 --> 01:09:45.837
- what did you tell her?
- Oh, it's ready?

01:09:45.872 --> 01:09:47.106
- Mary Grace!
- Okay, I gotta go.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:49.343
I'ma show Bill
how to use the jacuzzi jets.

01:09:49.376 --> 01:09:51.478
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
did you say "32 dicks"?

01:09:51.511 --> 01:09:52.979
- Mary Grace?
- Bye, Lauren.

01:09:53.011 --> 01:09:55.081
Jesus and Bill and I
love you so much.

01:09:55.114 --> 01:09:56.449
What does my mom know?

01:09:56.483 --> 01:09:57.851
What does she know?

01:09:58.885 --> 01:10:01.988
Jaime, come on, man.

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.690
You're better than this.

01:10:05.158 --> 01:10:06.593
No, I'm not.

01:10:32.886 --> 01:10:34.154
Hi, Jaime.

01:10:34.186 --> 01:10:36.957
It's been a while.

01:10:36.989 --> 01:10:38.524
Hey.

01:10:38.557 --> 01:10:39.926
I miss you.

01:10:39.958 --> 01:10:42.762
Well, it's a little
too late for that.

01:10:42.796 --> 01:10:44.865
I made a huge mistake.

01:10:44.898 --> 01:10:47.400
I should have given you
a second chance.

01:10:47.434 --> 01:10:50.103
Well, too bad,
because I've moved on, okay?

01:10:50.136 --> 01:10:52.672
No, you haven't.

01:10:52.704 --> 01:10:55.475
You still listen to Adele
and Sam Smith every night

01:10:55.507 --> 01:10:57.778
until your eyes burn
with salty tears.

01:10:57.810 --> 01:10:59.011
Shut up, that's not true.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:02.115
See? You are always pretending
to be someone you're not,

01:11:02.148 --> 01:11:03.617
because you are still afraid

01:11:03.649 --> 01:11:05.050
that I wouldn't love
the real you.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:06.752
Oh, please.

01:11:06.786 --> 01:11:08.020
You kept getting distant

01:11:08.054 --> 01:11:09.789
until I didn't
recognize you anymore.

01:11:09.823 --> 01:11:12.057
Well, surprise, surprise!

01:11:12.091 --> 01:11:14.461
The sock has all the answers.

01:11:14.493 --> 01:11:15.996
And what do you have, hm?

01:11:16.029 --> 01:11:17.564
A drum set?

01:11:17.596 --> 01:11:20.733
Big man on campus
with a drum set.

01:11:20.766 --> 01:11:23.103
Oh, wait, you're not on campus

01:11:23.136 --> 01:11:25.605
because you didn't go
back to school!

01:11:25.637 --> 01:11:26.773
You know what, that's it.

01:11:26.805 --> 01:11:28.140
I'm so done.

01:11:28.173 --> 01:11:30.411
So done.

01:11:32.110 --> 01:11:34.948
I am so done with you.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:36.015
So...

01:11:40.086 --> 01:11:42.588
Wait, let's be friends!

01:11:42.622 --> 01:11:43.923
With benefits!

01:11:43.957 --> 01:11:46.092
And then we'll fall in love
slowly again!

01:11:46.125 --> 01:11:48.228
Oh, baby. I'm sorry.

01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:51.064
I can't let you go!

01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:53.000
I still love you.

01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:55.801
Shit.

01:11:55.835 --> 01:11:57.837
Bill, we've got 30 minutes

01:11:57.871 --> 01:11:59.573
before the kids get home,
all right?

01:11:59.605 --> 01:12:03.042
So let's pave this open road
with jacuzzi's finest.

01:12:03.076 --> 01:12:05.145
- Woo!
- Fuck.

01:12:05.177 --> 01:12:07.747
Fuck!

01:12:09.849 --> 01:12:11.918
What the fuck?

01:12:13.987 --> 01:12:16.088
Hey, hey, hey, you okay?

01:12:16.122 --> 01:12:17.891
Oh, hey, neighbor.

01:12:17.923 --> 01:12:19.592
I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:12:19.626 --> 01:12:20.827
I was just, um...

01:12:20.859 --> 01:12:22.161
Reclaiming your space?

01:12:22.194 --> 01:12:24.764
- Can you...
- Hear all the inspirational shit

01:12:24.796 --> 01:12:25.698
that you're shouting all day?

01:12:25.731 --> 01:12:26.699
I can, yeah.

01:12:26.733 --> 01:12:28.068
You know, thin walls,
but don't worry, though.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:29.668
I'm sure you hear
all kinds of crazy shit

01:12:29.702 --> 01:12:30.637
from my place, too.

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:33.172
No. No, not at all.

01:12:33.206 --> 01:12:38.110
I mean, except that you've had
32 dicks in your body.

01:12:38.144 --> 01:12:39.913
- That was the TV.
- Oh.

01:12:39.945 --> 01:12:42.849
Yeah. Okay, well,
I was just making sure

01:12:42.881 --> 01:12:44.083
that no one was dead out here,

01:12:44.117 --> 01:12:46.753
like exploded into pieces,
so check.

01:12:46.786 --> 01:12:48.922
I'm gonna go back inside.

01:12:48.954 --> 01:12:50.724
Wait.

01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:54.293
Um, if you're not
doing anything,

01:12:54.327 --> 01:12:58.632
do you wanna come over
and have a drink?

01:12:58.664 --> 01:13:02.068
Oh. Oh, uh...

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:04.304
Yeah, I think probably not,
but thank you.

01:13:04.337 --> 01:13:06.172
And, you know, don't sweat it,

01:13:06.204 --> 01:13:08.841
'cause I know that
you're going through a lot,

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:12.612
but sooner or later,
you'll hook up with someone hot!

01:13:12.645 --> 01:13:14.748
Trademark.

01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.018
- That was the TV.
- Right.

01:13:18.051 --> 01:13:20.620
You know what?
Ah, fuck it, let's do it.

01:13:20.653 --> 01:13:22.789
- Really?
- Yeah, just...

01:13:22.822 --> 01:13:24.324
just know that
if this ends up in your vlog,

01:13:24.356 --> 01:13:25.725
I will key your car.

01:13:25.757 --> 01:13:28.561
- That's fair.
- All right, come on.

01:13:28.595 --> 01:13:31.331
- Lucky number 33!
- Oh, fuck off!

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:33.165
Hey, um, sorry
I got you in trouble

01:13:33.198 --> 01:13:36.168
- with that ginger.
- It's okay, he's whatever.

01:13:36.202 --> 01:13:38.070
It's kinda nice
having someone care enough

01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:40.039
to recognize a bad influence,
you know what I mean?

01:13:40.073 --> 01:13:42.042
Totally.

01:13:42.074 --> 01:13:44.243
So, are you gonna stick
with this whole sober thing?

01:13:44.277 --> 01:13:46.078
I think I am.

01:13:46.112 --> 01:13:47.614
After hearing
about Amy and Peter,

01:13:47.646 --> 01:13:48.948
it's made me think,

01:13:48.981 --> 01:13:50.216
if I don't quit
on this rehab thing,

01:13:50.248 --> 01:13:52.786
I might have a chance
to restart, you know?

01:13:52.819 --> 01:13:54.988
Yeah, I do know.

01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.057
It's made me realize
that I can't quit on Gabriel.

01:13:58.091 --> 01:13:59.226
You know?

01:13:59.259 --> 01:14:02.162
I have to go back and try
to fuck my boyfriend in the ass.

01:14:02.194 --> 01:14:04.363
Oh, so that's something
I think you should quit on.

01:14:04.396 --> 01:14:05.798
Okay.

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.934
Just relax, you know?

01:14:07.966 --> 01:14:10.903
Let all your bee stings soak.

01:14:10.936 --> 01:14:14.106
Man, you got stung
so many times.

01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:15.775
No one could've
seen that coming.

01:14:15.807 --> 01:14:17.109
I saw it coming,
until they started

01:14:17.143 --> 01:14:18.912
- going after my eyes.
- Sh-sh-sh.

01:14:18.944 --> 01:14:20.346
No, no, no.

01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.984
But how do you feel?

01:14:24.016 --> 01:14:25.751
This is actually really nice.

01:14:25.784 --> 01:14:27.252
I know.

01:14:27.286 --> 01:14:29.088
It's a little bit tight,

01:14:29.122 --> 01:14:32.392
so I'm just gonna
slip into here,

01:14:32.425 --> 01:14:34.961
and you're gonna dip
and give me your bottom.

01:14:34.993 --> 01:14:35.996
Okay.

01:14:36.029 --> 01:14:37.664
Oh, this is good.

01:14:37.697 --> 01:14:39.798
I feel really vulnerable
in this position.

01:14:39.832 --> 01:14:42.102
I feel great,
I feel very powerful.

01:14:42.135 --> 01:14:44.304
I feel like I could do
anything to you,

01:14:44.337 --> 01:14:46.139
and I wouldn't get in trouble,

01:14:46.171 --> 01:14:48.173
because I would have
better lawyers than you

01:14:48.207 --> 01:14:50.110
and it would be
my word against yours.

01:14:50.143 --> 01:14:52.378
That's a very specific fantasy.

01:14:52.412 --> 01:14:54.079
Deep breath.

01:14:54.113 --> 01:14:56.883
Now I'm going to insert
my little finger

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:58.318
into your little butthole.

01:14:58.350 --> 01:14:59.251
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:14:59.284 --> 01:15:01.054
What's happening here?

01:15:01.087 --> 01:15:03.089
This is going
from like zero to 60.

01:15:03.122 --> 01:15:04.791
I thought you just wanted me
to tie you up

01:15:04.823 --> 01:15:06.960
- or lightly choke you.
- What is this?

01:15:06.993 --> 01:15:08.094
Amateur Night at the Apollo?

01:15:08.127 --> 01:15:11.430
Why are you so paranoid
about us losing the passion?

01:15:11.463 --> 01:15:14.333
We have great sex, we're going
to keep having great sex,

01:15:14.367 --> 01:15:18.738
because I love you, okay?

01:15:18.770 --> 01:15:20.907
- Wait, really?
- Yeah.

01:15:20.939 --> 01:15:22.741
I know it's really soon
for me to say that,

01:15:22.774 --> 01:15:26.745
but I do.

01:15:26.779 --> 01:15:30.450
I do, too.

01:15:30.483 --> 01:15:33.720
I guess... I guess I was trying

01:15:33.752 --> 01:15:35.087
to make you do
all that crazy stuff

01:15:35.121 --> 01:15:37.724
because, you know,
my friends Amy and Peter

01:15:37.756 --> 01:15:40.159
are getting divorced
and they're our age,

01:15:40.193 --> 01:15:42.762
and I just feel like
if the passion can die for them,

01:15:42.795 --> 01:15:44.698
then it can die for us.

01:15:44.730 --> 01:15:47.701
I won't let that happen.

01:15:47.734 --> 01:15:49.436
Pinky swear?

01:15:49.469 --> 01:15:52.872
Not that.

01:15:52.904 --> 01:15:54.306
Okay, just this once.

01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:56.009
Right, just this once.

01:15:56.042 --> 01:15:57.243
Because next time,
it will be this.

01:15:57.275 --> 01:15:59.045
- Vanessa, no.
- Yes.

01:15:59.078 --> 01:15:59.979
No, Vanessa, drop it.

01:16:00.012 --> 01:16:02.181
- I'm...
- It's a deal breaker for me.

01:16:02.215 --> 01:16:03.483
- Drop it.
- It's a deal breaker!

01:16:03.515 --> 01:16:04.983
Just the pinky.

01:16:05.016 --> 01:16:07.854
Put it to the side,
just the pinky.

01:16:07.886 --> 01:16:09.021
Okay.

01:16:16.362 --> 01:16:19.265
Your grandparents really knew
how to keep the love alive.

01:16:19.297 --> 01:16:20.434
Yeah.

01:16:22.769 --> 01:16:24.971
How long were they married for?

01:16:25.003 --> 01:16:27.273
About 63 years.

01:16:27.305 --> 01:16:29.742
- That was before my grandma...
- Died?

01:16:31.176 --> 01:16:32.144
Right.

01:16:34.046 --> 01:16:36.115
So can I have this?

01:16:36.149 --> 01:16:37.751
You want a photo
of my dead grandparents?

01:16:37.783 --> 01:16:38.751
Yeah!

01:16:38.784 --> 01:16:42.322
I mean, they're dead,
and she always loved us.

01:16:42.354 --> 01:16:47.526
So can I have this
or are you just... what?

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.463
Why don't we come back
to the photo?

01:16:50.496 --> 01:16:51.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:16:51.497 --> 01:16:53.033
- Okay.
- Great.

01:16:59.337 --> 01:17:00.840
What about Bubbles?

01:17:00.872 --> 01:17:01.940
You want Bubbles?

01:17:01.974 --> 01:17:02.976
You always hated my fish!

01:17:03.009 --> 01:17:04.877
No, that's not what I'm saying.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:06.546
Well, then what are you saying?

01:17:06.578 --> 01:17:10.549
I think we should
split her 50/50.

01:17:10.582 --> 01:17:11.617
How the fuck
do you split a fish?

01:17:11.650 --> 01:17:13.353
You get half, I get half,
it's the only way.

01:17:13.386 --> 01:17:14.354
All right, I'm confused,

01:17:14.386 --> 01:17:16.322
are you saying
that you want to kill my fish?

01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:19.024
You said you wanted to be fair,
and this is fair!

01:17:19.057 --> 01:17:22.528
So we've just gotta burn her up
and split the bitch's ashes.

01:17:22.561 --> 01:17:23.896
What is wrong with you?

01:17:23.930 --> 01:17:25.131
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:17:25.163 --> 01:17:29.168
You... you care more
about a fish dying

01:17:29.202 --> 01:17:32.405
than our death,
our proverbial death.

01:17:32.438 --> 01:17:34.173
- You should be sad.
- I am sad!

01:17:34.207 --> 01:17:35.975
Oh, yeah, you have
a funny way of showing it.

01:17:36.007 --> 01:17:38.978
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:17:44.884 --> 01:17:45.585
Amy.

01:17:45.618 --> 01:17:46.386
What if I lit this book on fire,

01:17:46.418 --> 01:17:48.220
- would that make you sad?
- Amy.

01:17:48.253 --> 01:17:50.923
Would that make you
feel sad, Peter?

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.992
Amy, no.

01:17:53.024 --> 01:17:54.560
No, you... you wouldn't do that.

01:17:54.594 --> 01:17:55.994
You know how much
Michelle means to me.

01:17:56.028 --> 01:17:57.163
You gonna cry, Peter?

01:17:57.195 --> 01:17:58.864
You're looking
a little teary-eyed.

01:17:58.898 --> 01:18:00.867
You are acting insane right now.

01:18:00.899 --> 01:18:03.001
- I just want you to care.
- I do care!

01:18:03.034 --> 01:18:03.970
Oh, yeah?

01:18:04.002 --> 01:18:06.371
But clearly I can't
convince you of it,

01:18:06.404 --> 01:18:08.207
so if you're gonna
burn that book,

01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.309
burn the fucking book.

01:18:09.341 --> 01:18:10.242
We're getting off track.

01:18:10.277 --> 01:18:14.279
The point is
a 10-year relationship is ending

01:18:14.313 --> 01:18:16.315
and you haven't shed
a single fucking tear.

01:18:16.349 --> 01:18:17.550
Oh, so just because
you've cried,

01:18:17.582 --> 01:18:18.416
you're better than me.

01:18:18.451 --> 01:18:20.019
Yes, that is exactly
what that means.

01:18:20.051 --> 01:18:22.020
I cry, okay? I can cry.

01:18:22.054 --> 01:18:23.056
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:18:23.088 --> 01:18:24.390
This shit is hard for me, too.

01:18:24.422 --> 01:18:25.524
Then cry.

01:18:25.557 --> 01:18:27.260
Cry, you fucking pussy.

01:18:27.292 --> 01:18:28.828
Fine!

01:18:35.501 --> 01:18:37.637
Motherfucker.

01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:39.239
What? I gotta, like, get there.

01:18:39.271 --> 01:18:40.340
Yeah, get there.

01:18:46.378 --> 01:18:49.248
Oh, God, what is wrong with me?

01:18:51.449 --> 01:18:52.918
What are you doing?

01:18:55.154 --> 01:18:56.122
- Stab me.
- What?

01:18:56.154 --> 01:18:57.389
Take these scissors and stab me.

01:18:57.422 --> 01:18:58.523
- Absolutely not.
- Come on,

01:18:58.556 --> 01:19:00.659
I need like a...
like a physical push.

01:19:00.693 --> 01:19:02.161
I'm clearly not getting there
emotionally.

01:19:02.194 --> 01:19:03.196
You know, just like a...

01:19:03.229 --> 01:19:04.597
- and then I'm there!
- No!

01:19:04.630 --> 01:19:06.498
What if I, like,
hit an artery or something?

01:19:06.532 --> 01:19:07.667
What the fuck do you know
about arteries?

01:19:07.699 --> 01:19:10.168
Nothing, and I don't want
to fuck around with them!

01:19:10.202 --> 01:19:11.971
Okay, fine.

01:19:12.003 --> 01:19:14.673
- Um, hit me.
- What?

01:19:14.707 --> 01:19:16.142
Punch me in the face. Right?

01:19:16.175 --> 01:19:17.677
- Okay, sure.
- Okay, cool.

01:19:17.710 --> 01:19:19.612
So... but wait, not too hard,
I don't want to bruise.

01:19:19.645 --> 01:19:21.147
- Seriously?
- What, do you want people

01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:22.615
to think that you beat me?

01:19:22.648 --> 01:19:25.652
Good point, so, um...

01:19:25.685 --> 01:19:27.153
- Punch me in the stomach.
- Okay!

01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:28.688
- Perfect.
- Okay, yeah, I can do that!

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.289
It won't be too bad,
but it'll be enough.

01:19:30.323 --> 01:19:31.423
- Okay.
- Right, okay.

01:19:31.457 --> 01:19:34.694
All right,
so I'm just gonna flex.

01:19:34.726 --> 01:19:36.061
Ow! What the fuck?

01:19:36.095 --> 01:19:37.463
Sorry, it was just a reflex!

01:19:37.496 --> 01:19:39.132
You fucking asshole!

01:19:39.164 --> 01:19:40.099
I'm the asshole?

01:19:40.131 --> 01:19:41.600
Yes, this is all your fault.

01:19:41.634 --> 01:19:43.168
Right, no, yeah, no,

01:19:43.202 --> 01:19:44.503
you're perfect
and I'm the monster.

01:19:44.537 --> 01:19:46.172
I never said you were a monster.

01:19:46.204 --> 01:19:47.405
Yeah, well,
you sure act like it.

01:19:47.439 --> 01:19:50.309
Like it's my fault that
we aren't where we used to be.

01:19:50.342 --> 01:19:53.947
Well, it... it is partially
your fault.

01:19:53.979 --> 01:19:56.415
Yeah, but it's also yours,
you know?

01:19:56.448 --> 01:19:59.251
Like, it takes two to dance
or whatever.

01:19:59.284 --> 01:20:04.657
Sure, but that's not a phrase.

01:20:06.658 --> 01:20:09.161
God, this fucking sucks.

01:20:14.399 --> 01:20:16.335
Oh, my God.

01:20:16.368 --> 01:20:17.670
What?

01:20:17.703 --> 01:20:19.105
You're crying.

01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:27.413
I fucking did it.

01:20:27.445 --> 01:20:29.349
You fucking did it.

01:20:29.381 --> 01:20:30.649
Oh, fuck.

01:20:30.682 --> 01:20:32.217
Oh, my God.

01:20:32.251 --> 01:20:35.021
Wait, I think I have
another one coming.

01:20:35.054 --> 01:20:36.088
Give it to me.

01:20:36.122 --> 01:20:37.123
It's fucking coming.

01:20:37.155 --> 01:20:38.623
Oh, come for me.

01:20:38.657 --> 01:20:39.726
It's fucking coming.

01:20:41.092 --> 01:20:42.394
It's fucking coming.

01:20:42.427 --> 01:20:44.329
- Oh!
- It's coming!

01:20:48.734 --> 01:20:50.570
Are you feeling
what I'm feeling?

01:20:50.603 --> 01:20:52.171
Yes.

01:20:55.707 --> 01:20:57.609
Yes! We made it!

01:20:57.643 --> 01:20:58.476
Woo-woo!

01:20:58.511 --> 01:21:00.546
Thank God we were invited
this time.

01:21:00.578 --> 01:21:01.780
Were you guys invited?

01:21:01.814 --> 01:21:03.649
Oh, I forwarded them the link.

01:21:03.681 --> 01:21:06.485
Okay, so can I ask,

01:21:06.519 --> 01:21:08.387
is the divorce weighing heavily
on anyone else?

01:21:08.421 --> 01:21:09.555
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:21:09.587 --> 01:21:12.090
- Um, no.
- Yeah, I'm doing fine.

01:21:12.123 --> 01:21:15.594
Honestly, you guys, it has,
like, deeply affected me.

01:21:15.627 --> 01:21:18.530
You should hear what I tried
to do to my boyfriend.

01:21:18.564 --> 01:21:20.099
Seriously, Hannah,
I wanna tell you

01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:22.034
what I tried to do
to my boyfriend.

01:21:24.636 --> 01:21:27.305
Okay, anyone else
wanna weigh in?

01:21:27.338 --> 01:21:30.676
For me, the divorce has had
a deep effect on my spirit.

01:21:30.708 --> 01:21:32.478
You still at rehab
with the teens?

01:21:32.511 --> 01:21:35.148
- Wilderness rehab?
- Right.

01:21:35.180 --> 01:21:37.516
No, I'm with my new guru,
Vishnu.

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:39.786
Oh, God, Anderson,
did you join another cult?

01:21:39.819 --> 01:21:42.255
- We talked about this.
- Hard to say.

01:21:42.287 --> 01:21:44.356
Well, I don't know how the news
has really affected me,

01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:46.526
but it sent my mom
down a real spiral

01:21:46.559 --> 01:21:48.427
that ended with her
setting up a call

01:21:48.461 --> 01:21:49.762
with my former youth pastor

01:21:49.795 --> 01:21:52.265
that took a very
sexually explicit turn.

01:21:52.297 --> 01:21:53.632
- Hot.
- Yeah, I took the news

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:56.135
pretty badly, but thankfully,

01:21:56.167 --> 01:21:57.436
my friends
have been there for me.

01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:58.605
- Hi, everyone!
- Hey!

01:21:58.637 --> 01:22:00.840
- Who are these children?
- And where are Amy and Peter?

01:22:00.872 --> 01:22:03.442
It's like one depressing
group call was bad enough,

01:22:03.475 --> 01:22:04.710
but then to schedule
a second one

01:22:04.743 --> 01:22:05.744
and then show up late?

01:22:05.778 --> 01:22:07.847
Yeah, I was really
looking forward to seeing Peter.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.515
- You're the only one.
- I heard that!

01:22:09.547 --> 01:22:10.748
Okay, Noah, relax.

01:22:10.783 --> 01:22:14.153
Why don't you just go make out
with one of your partners?

01:22:14.185 --> 01:22:16.154
Oh, my God, is this
what they call a throuple?

01:22:16.188 --> 01:22:17.722
Oh, bitch, don't act
like you don't know

01:22:17.756 --> 01:22:18.791
what a threesome is!

01:22:18.823 --> 01:22:21.560
- I was there on Halloween 2012.
- Shut up, Anderson.

01:22:21.594 --> 01:22:22.561
Just fuck off right now.

01:22:22.595 --> 01:22:25.465
Vishnu, they're messing
with my spirit again!

01:22:25.497 --> 01:22:27.799
- Oh, my God!
- Anderson, shut the fuck up

01:22:27.832 --> 01:22:30.302
- with your fake sobriety.
- It's not fake.

01:22:30.336 --> 01:22:33.506
I am sober
from synthetic drugs.

01:22:33.538 --> 01:22:34.606
There is no difference.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.844
- If you're sober...
- Anderson, you keep bringing up

01:22:37.877 --> 01:22:39.412
stupid shit from college.

01:22:39.444 --> 01:22:40.880
But Peter is
such an amazing guy.

01:22:40.912 --> 01:22:42.747
He's like a 10 out of 10 dude.

01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:45.150
- Noah, Noah, enough.
- It wasn't a threesome,

01:22:45.184 --> 01:22:46.452
it was like someone
happened to be in the room...

01:22:46.484 --> 01:22:48.220
I left the camp a little early.

01:22:48.253 --> 01:22:49.454
Yeah, I called it a camp.

01:22:49.488 --> 01:22:50.823
It didn't feel
like a rehab to me,

01:22:50.855 --> 01:22:52.224
there was too many hot kids.

01:22:52.257 --> 01:22:53.259
I didn't want to be on
this Zoom call.

01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:54.759
I'm realizing I didn't want
to be on this.

01:22:54.792 --> 01:22:56.528
Yes, T.Y., let's go to the park.

01:22:56.561 --> 01:22:57.662
Well, fuck you!

01:22:57.695 --> 01:22:58.597
And fuck you.

01:22:58.631 --> 01:23:00.199
I'm not even talking to you.

01:23:00.231 --> 01:23:01.332
Toodles, bitch!

01:23:01.367 --> 01:23:03.336
Thank you, guys, thank you
for inviting us this time.

01:23:03.368 --> 01:23:04.503
You guys are all just jealous

01:23:04.537 --> 01:23:05.605
because my boyfriend
will let me peg him

01:23:05.637 --> 01:23:07.472
- and none of your will.
- Who cares?

01:23:07.506 --> 01:23:08.842
- Goodbye, you guys.
- I'm leaving.

01:23:09.942 --> 01:23:11.676
I miss Peter.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:14.146
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.249
I love you.

01:23:16.282 --> 01:23:18.751
I love you, too.

01:23:18.783 --> 01:23:20.452
It's so sweet
that you're so in touch

01:23:20.485 --> 01:23:22.622
with your emotions now.

01:23:22.654 --> 01:23:27.292
Yeah. It's... it's like
the switch got turned on,

01:23:27.326 --> 01:23:29.761
and I can't turn it off.

01:23:29.795 --> 01:23:32.297
Yeah, turn it off.

01:23:32.331 --> 01:23:34.534
Yeah, okay.

01:23:37.302 --> 01:23:39.238
You think we should
tell our friends

01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:41.306
about calling off the whole...

01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:43.476
Divorce thing?

01:23:43.509 --> 01:23:44.911
Yeah.

01:23:51.250 --> 01:23:52.818
- Do you think we could...
- Couldn't we maybe...

01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:53.851
- ...not tell them?
- ...not tell them?

01:23:53.886 --> 01:23:56.389
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah, I really didn't want

01:23:56.421 --> 01:23:59.224
- to go through that again.
- Me neither.

01:24:05.597 --> 01:24:07.733
I think I hate our friends.
