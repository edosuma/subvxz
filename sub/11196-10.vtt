00:06.965 --> 00:09.718
Previously on "Stargate SG-1"...

00:15.599 --> 00:18.519
- What is it?
- You tell me.

00:19.561 --> 00:23.941
"Under no circumstances
go to P4C- 970, Colonel Jack O'Neill. "

00:24.024 --> 00:27.861
- This looks like your handwriting.
- That is my handwriting.

00:27.986 --> 00:32.533
- And it's my signature.
- That looks like blood, sir.

00:32.658 --> 00:36.453
I want P4C- 970 removed from
the dialling computer immediately.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.164
I wonder why you sent it.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.375
I wonder when.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.969 --> 00:54.054
Welcome back, SG-1.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.516
Break out the fishing gear, General!
Our job here is done.

00:58.433 --> 01:01.770
- I take it your mission was successful?
- In a word, sir, yes.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.982
In two words, yes, sir.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.569
Your report said the Volians
were a simple agrarian society.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.947
- That they are.
- They introduced us to another race.

01:12.030 --> 01:16.076
Who, while lacking a sense of humour,
make up for it in advanced technology.

01:16.159 --> 01:19.162
They just wanted to make sure
we were trustworthy first.

01:19.246 --> 01:23.041
Long story short, I think we just
carried out our standing orders, sir.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.420
Indeed. We may have found
a race both willing and capable

01:26.545 --> 01:29.798
of defending this world
against the Goa'uld.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.760
- If that outburst didn't convince you...
- I'm convinced.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.347
We just wrapped up several hours
of talks with a guy named...

01:37.472 --> 01:41.268
- Borren.
- Who really lacks a sense of humour.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.938
But he wants the negotiations
to move up to the state level.

01:45.063 --> 01:50.736
Well done. While I inform the president,
you prepare a mission briefing.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.280
Yes, sir.

01:53.405 --> 01:56.491
By the way,
what do our new friends call themselves?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.453
The Aschen, sir.
They're called the Aschen.

03:04.977 --> 03:08.897
So, out of security concerns,
the Aschen wish not to reveal the location

03:09.022 --> 03:12.109
of their home world
until we have an agreement.

03:12.234 --> 03:16.530
- They're a little paranoid.
- Appropriate, as they don't have an iris.

03:16.655 --> 03:20.033
We do know they've created
a secondary star in the Volian system

03:20.158 --> 03:23.954
by igniting a gas giant, thereby
doubling the Volians' growing season.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.123
They made a star? How?

03:26.456 --> 03:31.170
Well, theoretically, by increasing the
density of a sufficiently massive gas giant

03:31.295 --> 03:33.714
until a thermonuclear reaction took place.

03:33.839 --> 03:37.009
- In fact, Arthur C Clarke posited...
- Ambassador.

03:37.134 --> 03:42.055
You gotta be careful about using the word
"how" unless you really wanna know.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.600
My mistake, Colonel.

03:44.725 --> 03:48.061
My point is, the achievement
itself goes a long way to prove

03:48.187 --> 03:51.106
the Aschen are advanced
enough to take on the Goa'uld.

03:51.190 --> 03:53.233
The Aschen could be formidable allies.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.612
If they're Stargate capable,
why haven't we heard of'em?

03:56.695 --> 04:01.325
Good question. They only use their ships
to go to planets in their confederation.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.535
Of which the Volian system is a part.

04:03.660 --> 04:07.539
Yes. Borren said the Aschen and Volian
gates were discovered buried, like ours.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.291
No DHD was ever recovered.

04:09.416 --> 04:12.503
The Aschen tried dialling
numerous symbol combinations,

04:12.586 --> 04:16.632
but without a DHD to compensate for
stellar drift, they were stuck, like us.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.051
- We could only go to Abydos.
- Exactly.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.012
Only after Daniel found
the cartouche on Abydos

04:22.137 --> 04:26.183
could we make the drift calculations
to successfully dial other planets.

04:26.266 --> 04:30.395
Add the database Colonel O'Neill
retrieved from the library of the Ancients...

04:30.479 --> 04:35.484
We can offer access to a galaxy of worlds
and races the Aschen never knew existed.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.195
The news must have
come as a shock to them.

04:38.320 --> 04:40.531
Oh, not really.

04:40.656 --> 04:44.159
Jack is saying that if they were surprised,
they'd never show it.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.620
They don't get excited in general,
General.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.289
It's like an entire planet of accountants.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.417
Colonel O'Neill mistrusts the Aschen.

04:52.543 --> 04:54.586
- I didn't say that.
- Indeed you did.

04:54.711 --> 04:55.879
No, I didn't.

04:56.004 --> 05:00.801
What I said was I didn't trust
people without a sense of humour.

05:00.926 --> 05:02.970
- Especially that boring guy.
- Borren.

05:03.095 --> 05:05.347
I know his name. He was boring.

05:05.472 --> 05:10.811
The Aschen have agreed to meet
our representative on P3A- 194 tomorrow.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.897
Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter

05:14.022 --> 05:17.401
are to be available
to the ambassador as consultants.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.820
- Yes, sir.
- Dr Jackson,

05:19.945 --> 05:22.865
I'd like you and Teal'c
to confer with the Volians.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.492
Find out how they feel about the Aschen.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.078
- I can tell you that now, sir.
- Dig deeper.

05:28.203 --> 05:31.957
Find out from the Volians if the Aschen
are the good neighbours they seem to be.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.376
You'll embark at 0700. Gentlemen?

05:39.923 --> 05:43.886
Major Carter? Since we're trading
knowledge of the Stargate,

05:44.011 --> 05:47.931
I could probably use a little more
of that knowledge myself.

05:48.056 --> 05:50.309
After you, Ambassador.

05:56.231 --> 06:00.277
- This place never ceases to amaze me.
- Anything yet?

06:00.360 --> 06:04.156
The computer should have it down
to a handful of candidates by tomorrow.

06:04.281 --> 06:06.325
- Candidates?
- Yeah.

06:06.450 --> 06:10.120
We're trying to determine
the location of the Aschen home planet.

06:10.245 --> 06:12.372
How can you, without the coordinates?

06:12.498 --> 06:14.875
- How?
- Oh, I asked that question again.

06:16.293 --> 06:20.172
In my early work with the Stargate
programme, I theorised that

06:20.297 --> 06:25.344
the limit for a lock between two Stargates
without a DHD was 300 light years.

06:25.469 --> 06:27.721
We are searching for viable coordinates

06:27.846 --> 06:31.725
within that radius
of the Volian system, P3A- 194.

06:31.850 --> 06:36.480
- As the Aschen world is in this area?
- There's a 70 per cent probability.

06:36.605 --> 06:38.774
Why don't the Aschen want us to know?

06:38.899 --> 06:42.736
Until we share our database, they have
only our word of what's out there.

06:42.861 --> 06:47.407
They're vulnerable. If we didn't have
an iris, I think we'd do the same.

06:48.116 --> 06:52.246
You know what?
I have not eaten since, uh... oh, today.

06:54.456 --> 06:58.335
The mess is this way.
If you'd like, we can talk more there.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.629
I'd like that very much.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.811
Chevron three, encoded.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.990
Morning.

07:31.952 --> 07:36.165
- This is what you're wearing?
- What's wrong with it?

07:36.248 --> 07:39.835
- Nothing.
- Chevron four, encoded.

07:40.586 --> 07:43.755
- You look fine.
- They said I didn't need a uniform.

07:43.881 --> 07:47.801
- I just wanna make a good impression.
- Chevron five, encoded.

07:47.926 --> 07:50.679
- You look great. Very sharp.
- Thank you.

07:51.263 --> 07:53.599
Chevron six, encoded.

07:53.724 --> 07:56.101
It's the shoes.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.355
They're gonna get ruined.

08:01.023 --> 08:03.317
It's a farm planet.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.153
Chevron seven, locked.

08:22.127 --> 08:25.839
Enjoy the ride, Ambassador.
We'll look forward to your return.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.719
- After you.
- Thank you.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.394
- It looks just like, uh...
- Oh, yeah.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.815
Just when you think you're not
in Kansas any more, turns out you are.

09:27.109 --> 09:30.112
- We'll see what we can dig up.
- Have fun.

09:33.240 --> 09:37.536
You said the Volians and the Aschen
enjoy a long- standing trade relationship,

09:37.619 --> 09:42.457
but there aren't any signs of trade
infrastructure around the Stargate.

09:42.583 --> 09:45.335
- What is that sound?
- Have a look.

09:59.433 --> 10:03.645
It's a harvester. The Aschen provided
hundreds of them all over the planet.

10:03.770 --> 10:06.023
When a field is ready, it harvests the crop

10:06.148 --> 10:10.694
and then brings it to the Stargate
for transport to the Aschen home world.

10:20.913 --> 10:22.706
We're gonna want a few of those.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.877
I'm sure that can be arranged, Colonel.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.255
- Borren!
- Colonel.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.928
I thought I made it clear
your weapons were unnecessary.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.305
I thought you were jokin' around.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.767
You know, like you always do.

10:44.520 --> 10:47.981
Borren, may I introduce
our official representative,

10:48.106 --> 10:50.776
Ambassador Joseph Faxon
of the United States.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.612
- I bring greetings...
- I am not your counterpart.

10:53.695 --> 10:58.075
The harvester possesses a suitable
compartment. This way, please.

11:02.246 --> 11:04.289
Shoes.

11:07.626 --> 11:10.212
- You have something?
- I'll show you on the star map.

11:10.337 --> 11:13.257
We've calculated five
possible Stargate coordinates

11:13.382 --> 11:17.594
within a 300 light year radius
of P3A- 194, the Volian system.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.389
And there's a good chance
one is the Aschen world?

11:20.472 --> 11:23.725
These three were just calculated,
so they're unexplored.

11:23.809 --> 11:27.563
This one was determined uninhabitable
by a MALP probe three years ago.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.774
But, sir, this gate was locked out
of our dialling computer

11:30.899 --> 11:33.318
by your order seven months ago.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.487
So there's a one in four chance

11:35.612 --> 11:39.074
that the Aschen home world
is a planet that I ordered off limits?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.200
Yes, sir.

11:40.325 --> 11:44.371
Have SG teams 3, 12 and 15 report to
the briefing room as soon as possible.

11:44.496 --> 11:46.540
Yes, sir.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.642
Keel.

12:05.976 --> 12:08.187
It's Dan Jackson and Teal'c.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.064
You said you'd not likely
be this way again.

12:11.190 --> 12:14.359
We wanted to learn about
your relationship with the Aschen.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.571
- What would you like to know?
- If they are honourable.

12:19.281 --> 12:22.367
Yeah. I wouldn't have put it
quite that way, but...

12:22.451 --> 12:25.370
They've been friends to us
since I remember.

12:25.454 --> 12:29.166
I was raised by an Aschen family. Orphan.

12:30.292 --> 12:35.714
They give medicine freely, machines
freely... Light and heat for our homes.

12:36.256 --> 12:39.510
So they've never been
unreasonable with you in any way?

12:39.635 --> 12:45.224
They just float around in their harvesters
mostly, what few of them there are.

12:45.599 --> 12:51.355
- You maintain freedom from their world?
- If freedom is bein' left alone, we have it.

12:54.358 --> 12:56.568
OK. Well, thank you.

12:58.278 --> 13:04.034
Uh... when next you speak to one,
tell'em I got iron root in my south field.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.496
Can't dig it out myself.
Need one of their machines.

13:07.621 --> 13:11.124
Iron root?
Well, maybe... maybe we can help.

13:17.798 --> 13:19.842
Stand here.

13:39.862 --> 13:43.365
Oh, yeah... we're gonna
want a few of these too.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.588
Let me introduce your
counterpart from our confederation.

13:57.713 --> 14:01.258
- Mollem.
- I offer greetings from our president,

14:01.383 --> 14:04.970
in the hope we can forge a friendship
to enrich both our peoples.

14:05.095 --> 14:09.558
This seating arrangement is suitable
for our negotiations. Please.

14:13.604 --> 14:16.356
I assume there are facilities on board?

14:16.857 --> 14:19.151
In the next compartment.

14:20.694 --> 14:23.614
Just wanted to make sure
before we flew off somewhere.

14:23.697 --> 14:29.453
The harvester will remain in the vicinity of
the Stargate throughout the negotiations.

14:30.454 --> 14:32.581
Mind if I check out the view first?

14:55.854 --> 14:59.900
Daniel, Teal'c, we're on board
one of their harvesters.

14:59.983 --> 15:03.779
When you get back, report to Hammond.
Let him know proceedings have begun.

15:04.446 --> 15:06.740
Copy that. And good luck.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.542
Here it is.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.798
It goes deep, I'll tell you that.

15:24.758 --> 15:28.971
Keel, we can probably take care of this
for you with Teal'c's staff weapon.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.474
General Hammond's request
was to gather information.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.686
He also said we should dig a little deeper.

15:37.354 --> 15:40.190
There's a jug
of my best sweetwater in it for you.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.317
OK.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.912
- Have you discovered something?
- Oh, God, I hope not.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.374
Probably, though.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.836
Our position is straightforward.

16:02.254 --> 16:05.966
You discovered means of travel
between Stargates all over the galaxy.

16:06.091 --> 16:09.428
- Several hundred worlds, I am told.
- Yes.

16:10.137 --> 16:12.806
And you seek technologies
for purposes of defence

16:12.931 --> 16:17.144
against hostile races you
have encountered on these travels.

16:17.269 --> 16:18.979
Yes, we do.

16:19.104 --> 16:24.276
We agree, in principle, to provide you
with these defence technologies,

16:24.401 --> 16:30.741
and much more, in exchange for your full
disclosure of this Stargate network.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.787
And we also agree, in principle.

16:53.096 --> 16:55.641
An ancient city once stood here.

16:57.059 --> 17:00.646
I don't know about ancient.
Certainly, extinct.

17:00.771 --> 17:03.774
I don't wanna talk semantics,
but even if this was a city

17:03.899 --> 17:06.318
just a few hundred years ago,

17:07.402 --> 17:09.445
what happened?

17:17.788 --> 17:20.624
What is the current population of Earth?

17:20.874 --> 17:23.961
Well, forgive me.
I don't know the exact number.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.923
Somewhere in
the neighbourhood of six billion?

17:28.382 --> 17:30.843
Growing at a rate
of several million a year.

17:30.968 --> 17:34.888
- That growth rate is unsustainable.
- We agree.

17:35.264 --> 17:39.059
- You represent the dominant nation?
- That is a fair assessment.

17:39.184 --> 17:42.896
And so are you taking military action
to curtail this growth rate?

17:43.021 --> 17:46.817
No. We respect
the sovereignty of our neighbours.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.195
We are pleased to hear that.

17:50.904 --> 17:54.741
The worlds of the confederation
are a partnership of equals.

17:57.494 --> 18:01.790
Do not be alarmed. The harvester
is continuing its normal operations.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.753
While you may respect these neighbours,

18:07.963 --> 18:12.176
you have not yet revealed to them
the existence of your Stargate.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.344
Not to all.

18:14.469 --> 18:18.599
Any treaty between the Aschen
Confederation and the people of Earth

18:18.682 --> 18:20.893
must be with all the people of Earth.

18:27.232 --> 18:29.902
I think we can agree to that.

18:33.197 --> 18:37.951
The level of technology appears
to be similar to Earth, circa 1910.

18:40.704 --> 18:44.666
There appears to be
no sign of battle, Daniel Jackson.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.628
But I can tell you that,
barring a natural disaster,

18:47.753 --> 18:50.672
it takes nature
several centuries to bury a city.

18:50.756 --> 18:54.009
This place looks like
it was just ploughed over recently.

18:54.134 --> 18:58.597
- Perhaps to create farmland.
- Or the Volians had a Luddite movement.

18:58.680 --> 19:03.560
Whoever did this, they probably did it
long after the city was abandoned.

19:04.520 --> 19:07.272
- There are no human remains.
- Exactly.

19:07.397 --> 19:09.691
So the question is: why?

19:13.570 --> 19:18.826
This looks like a public building of some
sort. I'm gonna go and take a look around.

19:24.706 --> 19:26.959
It may be extremely dangerous.

19:27.084 --> 19:29.127
Yes, it may.

19:31.421 --> 19:34.675
I'm gonna go inside
and take a look around.

19:40.347 --> 19:44.017
Several months ago we received
a message through the Stargate

19:44.142 --> 19:50.065
that simply stated "Under no
circumstances go to P4C- 970."

19:50.190 --> 19:52.776
- The warning from the future.
- That's the theory.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.445
We don't know
the circumstances it was written in,

19:55.571 --> 20:00.909
only that the signature and the blood
found on the note match Colonel O'Neill's.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.328
We've determined that the race of people

20:03.453 --> 20:06.456
we're currently in trade
negotiations with, the Aschen,

20:06.540 --> 20:09.209
may be from one of these four planets.

20:09.710 --> 20:14.548
Then the only way to rule out 970 as the
Aschen world is to check the other three.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.134
That's your mission.
Have your teams ready

20:17.259 --> 20:19.678
once the MALPs
determine you're good to go.

20:20.804 --> 20:23.557
Just out of curiosity,

20:23.640 --> 20:27.853
what kind of defence technologies
are we talking about?

20:27.978 --> 20:31.732
Space guns? Force fields? Motherships?

20:36.236 --> 20:41.241
This is an example of a bioweapon
we can make available to you.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.704
A living, radioactive
genetic material that may be designed

20:45.829 --> 20:49.541
to attack and destroy
only the specific DNA of your enemy.

20:52.377 --> 20:55.714
We have a number
of efficient delivery systems.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.010
We'd want certain assurances...

21:00.093 --> 21:05.057
That we take military action only against
your enemies, and not your friends.

21:05.182 --> 21:07.476
Of course.

21:07.601 --> 21:11.021
The question arises,
why have these "friends" of Earth

21:11.146 --> 21:15.692
not already provided you with the defence
technologies that you seek from us?

21:15.776 --> 21:18.695
Most advanced races that
we've befriended hesitated

21:18.820 --> 21:24.743
to share their technology with us for fear
that we could use it to destroy ourselves.

21:25.202 --> 21:28.288
True friends would
endeavour to prevent that.

21:28.413 --> 21:31.333
You have changed
the way in which we view the universe.

21:31.458 --> 21:35.170
Do not underestimate
what we offer in return for that gift.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.841
We can put an end to disease.
Double the human life span.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.512
Provide the means to cross
entire continents in a single step.

21:43.637 --> 21:48.308
Much more than simply a means to
defend yourselves against your enemies.

21:48.433 --> 21:53.146
We offer Earth membership
within the Aschen Confederation.

22:04.491 --> 22:07.744
- Chevron one, encoded.
- Sir? Pentagon, line one.

22:10.038 --> 22:12.082
This is Hammond.

22:12.207 --> 22:16.336
- Yes, sir, we were just about to de...
- Chevron two, encoded.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.463
May I ask why?

22:19.715 --> 22:21.842
Understood.

22:21.967 --> 22:27.306
- Sergeant, abort the dialling sequence.
- Yes, sir. Aborting dialling sequence.

22:27.431 --> 22:32.352
SG-15, your recon mission is scrubbed
until further notice. You may stand down.

22:32.477 --> 22:35.856
- Sir, what's going on?
- That's what I aim to find out.

22:41.236 --> 22:45.449
It would not be wise to attempt
that again, Daniel Jackson.

22:48.160 --> 22:53.999
OK. Now, if I'm right,
these are newspapers.

23:07.262 --> 23:09.306
There seems to be faint pictures.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.768
Yes, and hopefully
they'll paint a thousand words.

23:14.770 --> 23:19.233
It's similar to an ancient Celtic text I found
in Wales. I can make some of this out.

23:21.360 --> 23:23.737
We need to look for big headlines first.

23:23.862 --> 23:26.615
This cavern may be unstable.

23:26.698 --> 23:29.368
It would be best
if we returned to the surface.

23:29.493 --> 23:31.537
Oh, I don't think so.

23:31.662 --> 23:35.123
If this doesn't help us,
we'll have to take another look around.

23:35.249 --> 23:38.001
If the Aschen really
do have something to hide,

23:38.126 --> 23:41.213
I don't think
we're gonna get a second chance.

23:43.048 --> 23:46.677
Colonel, you seem pensive.

23:48.428 --> 23:50.597
No, I was just thinking.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.936
You're offering
a lot more than we asked for.

23:56.019 --> 23:58.313
Our motives are not entirely selfless.

23:58.438 --> 24:01.275
Perhaps you offer more
than you give yourself credit for.

24:01.400 --> 24:05.863
- Access to the Stargate network.
- And the promise of much more, Major.

24:05.988 --> 24:08.991
An introduction to advanced races
you have befriended,

24:09.116 --> 24:12.369
just as the Volians introduced you to us.

24:12.494 --> 24:15.664
Your ways and culture will enrich ours.

24:15.998 --> 24:20.127
The Aschen are not the natural explorers
that you so obviously are.

24:20.627 --> 24:25.841
Fortified by our technology,
you can continue your exploration,

24:25.966 --> 24:29.136
share with us what you learn.

24:29.219 --> 24:32.681
You understand I have
to present your offer to our leaders?

24:32.806 --> 24:36.852
You'll find we are
a very patient people, Ambassador.

24:41.815 --> 24:47.070
In the meantime, I will also confer with
my leadership, and recommend to them

24:47.196 --> 24:51.074
the immediate commencement
of trade between our worlds.

24:57.581 --> 25:00.000
I look forward to our future together.

25:01.001 --> 25:03.045
As do I.

25:06.381 --> 25:08.091
Well,

25:08.175 --> 25:11.762
that was... easy.

25:12.262 --> 25:14.306
This was just the first stage.

25:14.431 --> 25:17.893
If you thought it was too easy,
you won't feel that when we're done.

25:18.018 --> 25:21.855
So I'm the only one
that has a bad feeling about this.

25:23.857 --> 25:25.317
Yes.

25:31.281 --> 25:33.325
Just checking.

25:34.326 --> 25:38.705
The headline says something
about a pandemic. Some sort of...

25:39.331 --> 25:41.834
I can't translate that. Maybe "fever".

25:42.960 --> 25:46.213
If the Aschen are the "newcomers"
in this article, they provided a...

25:46.338 --> 25:49.800
Can't translate that, but it
appears to have been a sort of vaccine.

25:49.925 --> 25:53.262
And the Volian people
were immensely grateful.

25:53.637 --> 25:56.306
Which serves to prove
the Aschen are honourable.

25:56.431 --> 26:02.271
All it proves is the city was abandoned
after they made contact with the Aschen.

26:02.354 --> 26:05.732
Cities are usually abandoned
when civilisations fall.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.861
Perhaps they relocated
in the Aschen Confederation.

26:08.944 --> 26:13.323
I don't like the sound of that either.
Keel said he'd never been anywhere else.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.410
This city has been
abandoned for many years.

26:16.493 --> 26:21.373
Yes, but long enough ago for Keel to have
absolutely no idea it was ever here?

26:24.710 --> 26:30.132
Welcome back. As per your instructions,
Ambassador, an air- force jet is waiting

26:30.257 --> 26:33.802
to take you to Washington
as soon as you're cleared by our doctors.

26:33.927 --> 26:38.640
Thank you, General. History will
remember your contribution to this.

26:39.016 --> 26:41.768
O'Neill. Two Ls.

26:43.061 --> 26:45.272
And, Major, next time I'm here,

26:45.397 --> 26:48.317
I know a restaurant that
beats your mess, hands down.

26:48.442 --> 26:50.736
I'd like that.

26:56.700 --> 27:01.455
Well, General, it might be time
to reconsider this retirement thing.

27:01.580 --> 27:04.583
Not yet, Colonel. Come with me.

27:09.505 --> 27:13.091
The president doesn't want to risk
a potentially rewarding alliance

27:13.217 --> 27:16.595
on the basis of a note that may or may not
be a warning from the future.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.973
I knew that thing
was gonna come back to haunt me.

27:20.057 --> 27:24.269
General, to confirm the Aschen are from
a world other than 970 is only prudent.

27:24.353 --> 27:28.398
And if we encounter the Aschen
on one of those other worlds?

27:28.482 --> 27:32.528
- They wouldn't be too happy about it.
- It could jeopardise the treaty.

27:32.653 --> 27:34.780
- Send a probe.
- Maybe sending a probe

27:34.905 --> 27:39.993
was what caused the problem you were
trying to avoid by sending your note.

27:40.118 --> 27:42.371
Technically, I haven't sent it yet.

27:42.496 --> 27:45.332
But if I get a chance again,
I'll add a lot more detail.

27:45.457 --> 27:50.587
You were probably trying to limit the
causality violation by keeping it simple.

27:50.712 --> 27:53.465
I wonder whose idea that was.

27:54.842 --> 27:58.971
You know me. I wouldn't have sent
that note without a damn good reason.

27:59.096 --> 28:02.015
- The president should know that.
- He's under pressure

28:02.140 --> 28:06.436
to present a real benefit of the Stargate
programme before the next election.

28:06.520 --> 28:10.023
- Oh, here we go.
- The bottom line is, he wants us out of it.

28:10.148 --> 28:13.068
From now on, this treaty is a state matter.

28:13.944 --> 28:18.323
- What did Daniel and Teal'c find out?
- They haven't returned yet.

28:20.325 --> 28:25.831
The Aschen vaccine had a side effect.
I don't know what.

28:25.956 --> 28:29.042
It might be an Aschen word,
but I know it was big news here.

28:29.168 --> 28:32.254
- How would you know this?
- It's in big black letters.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.215
"Aschen vaccine causes... " something.

28:35.299 --> 28:37.467
I don't know what, but it's not good.

28:37.593 --> 28:41.555
These pictures appear to be like
those we saw of people celebrating.

28:41.680 --> 28:43.974
I don't think they're celebrating.

28:44.099 --> 28:46.143
I think they're rioting.

28:46.894 --> 28:49.354
Daniel? Teal'c?

28:52.274 --> 28:56.153
We're in an underground cavern.
Do the Aschen know we're down here?

28:56.486 --> 29:00.157
Negative. Keel said
you were digging a hole around here.

29:00.282 --> 29:04.244
Yeah. Um, stay put. We'll come meet you.

29:12.169 --> 29:14.213
Boy, when they dig a hole...

29:17.716 --> 29:19.510
Daniel, where exactly are you?

29:19.593 --> 29:23.388
We're in the buried ruins
of the Volian union's capital city.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.682
By all accounts, a thriving metropolis.

29:25.807 --> 29:29.853
That is, I think,
until the Aschen wiped them out.

29:38.111 --> 29:40.072
OK, here's what we know.

29:40.989 --> 29:44.493
200 years ago, the Volians
were a thriving urban civilisation,

29:44.618 --> 29:48.539
approximating turn- of- the- century
North America in terms of technology.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.999
- That wasn't very long ago.
- No, it wasn't.

29:51.124 --> 29:54.461
- What happened to them?
- We know there was a flu pandemic,

29:54.545 --> 29:57.464
like the one on Earth in 1918
that killed over 20 million.

29:57.589 --> 30:00.843
- Now that is when the Aschen came.
- Through the Stargate?

30:00.926 --> 30:04.513
In ships. The Volian gate
wasn't discovered until years later.

30:04.638 --> 30:08.767
They befriended the Volians, offered
them a vaccine and saved their world.

30:08.892 --> 30:13.105
So the Aschen were heroes to the Volians
and their friendship lasted years.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.232
But then something happened.

30:16.608 --> 30:18.569
- What?
- I don't know.

30:18.694 --> 30:21.864
- We found no evidence of battle.
- I found one clue.

30:22.573 --> 30:28.328
Here. This word loosely translates
as "medicine","vaccine","drug",

30:28.412 --> 30:30.789
Followed by "from the newcomers",

30:30.914 --> 30:35.669
Followed by "causes", followed by
some word I can't translate.

30:36.253 --> 30:39.673
This was the latest issue we found,
which most likely indicates

30:39.798 --> 30:42.885
the paper shut down
or was shut down the very next day.

30:42.968 --> 30:45.137
Vaccine causes what?

30:45.262 --> 30:47.306
I don't know. But it caused something.

30:47.431 --> 30:50.809
In 200 years, they went
from an urban civilisation of millions

30:50.934 --> 30:55.397
to an agrarian one of thousands,
after they were "saved" by the Aschen.

31:00.110 --> 31:03.447
- You have to speak to the president.
- I just tried.

31:03.572 --> 31:07.493
He's being briefed by
the ambassador and won't take my call.

31:07.618 --> 31:12.289
General, I never did cash in on that
open invitation to visit the White House.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.378
Remember?
Last time we saved the world?

31:31.266 --> 31:33.685
Driver.

31:34.186 --> 31:36.230
Pennsylvania Avenue is that way.

31:36.522 --> 31:38.857
We're picking up another passenger, sir.

31:38.982 --> 31:41.026
I beg your pardon?

31:52.830 --> 31:54.998
Colonel Starsky.

31:56.917 --> 32:00.254
Or is it Hutch?
I can never remember which one you are.

32:00.337 --> 32:02.923
Kinsey.

32:03.048 --> 32:05.884
What the hell are you doing here?

32:06.009 --> 32:08.303
I know it's more upscale
than you're used to,

32:08.428 --> 32:11.014
but I wanted a comfortable place to talk.

32:22.401 --> 32:24.528
Drink?

32:24.653 --> 32:26.780
I have an appointment.

32:26.905 --> 32:28.949
No, you don't.

32:32.161 --> 32:36.206
You shoulda heard the president when
he heard you want to change his mind.

32:36.331 --> 32:39.334
- He can be cruel.
- The treaty's a mistake.

32:39.960 --> 32:43.589
- You recommended it in the first place.
- I was wrong.

32:44.256 --> 32:47.009
Hell, this was worth it just to hear that.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.386
Let me tell you what it comes down to.

32:49.511 --> 32:54.725
Those of us who actually have been voted
into office would like the opportunity

32:54.850 --> 32:58.896
to make the damn decisions about
the governments we make treaties with.

32:59.021 --> 33:02.774
- You don't have all the information.
- I know all about the note.

33:02.900 --> 33:07.863
- That's why you should take it seriously.
- We have experts who know these things.

33:07.988 --> 33:11.241
They tell me that the ink on your note was

33:11.325 --> 33:16.997
a new biodegradable something- or- other
that hasn't quite been invented yet.

33:17.080 --> 33:21.543
- What's your point?
- What's the future like? You can tell me.

33:21.668 --> 33:25.797
- As far as I know, it hasn't happened yet.
- It has, for you.

33:25.923 --> 33:30.469
Hell, you've been back in time,
forward in time, you've seen it all.

33:31.220 --> 33:34.306
I just wonder how things turn out.

33:34.389 --> 33:38.435
You know, without you
being a hero any more.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.437
This has nothing to do with me.

33:40.562 --> 33:45.567
I wonder how far you'd go to stop me
becoming president of the United States.

33:47.820 --> 33:50.572
You think this is about you?

33:52.074 --> 33:55.160
- Of all the self- centred, egotistical...
- Egotistical?

33:55.285 --> 33:59.331
You're the one who can't stop
playing God with our future.

33:59.414 --> 34:02.501
The minute we try to make
a deal for alien technology,

34:02.626 --> 34:05.546
you decide that they're
the wrong kind of aliens!

34:05.879 --> 34:09.632
Even our current president's
begun to see the pattern.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.302
And, boy, he used to love you.

34:12.928 --> 34:17.224
We know all about the 70 per cent
probabilities, the one- in- four chances.

34:17.349 --> 34:20.686
Kinsey... you're in way over your head.

34:20.978 --> 34:23.021
Am I?

34:24.147 --> 34:29.820
This is really a political matter, Colonel,
which will require bilateral approval.

34:29.902 --> 34:35.576
And that's why the president put me in
charge of the next stage of negotiations.

34:40.831 --> 34:43.583
Driver, stop at the athletic club, please.

34:45.543 --> 34:49.672
Oh, you'll get your invitation
to the White House soon enough, Colonel.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.800
Just not tonight.

34:54.594 --> 34:57.681
Jonathan, when we get
to the athletic club, I'll step out.

34:57.806 --> 35:02.269
You go on and take
our guest back to Andrews.

35:25.042 --> 35:29.254
Apparently, we have agreed to make
a token gesture of our good faith.

35:29.338 --> 35:31.423
Ambassador Faxon will deliver it

35:31.548 --> 35:36.011
and return with an Aschen delegation
to meet Senator Kinsey.

35:36.261 --> 35:38.305
We're actually going ahead with this?

35:38.430 --> 35:41.975
- I'm told we're proceeding with caution.
- What are we offering?

35:42.100 --> 35:45.020
- Gate coordinates.
- There goes the neighbourhood.

35:45.145 --> 35:47.606
Ambassador Faxon has asked that

35:47.731 --> 35:52.194
Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter
accompany him again.

35:52.277 --> 35:55.989
- I thought we were out of it.
- Apparently, he's insisted.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.617
Senator Kinsey agreed,
but only to Major Carter,

35:58.742 --> 36:01.912
which presents us
with a window of opportunity.

36:01.995 --> 36:04.832
- What can I do?
- Force their hand somehow.

36:07.084 --> 36:10.170
If we accuse them directly,
they may simply lie.

36:10.295 --> 36:13.298
Maybe we don't have to.
I have an idea.

36:18.387 --> 36:21.640
Major, I can't order you to do this.

36:22.766 --> 36:25.519
I know, sir. When do we leave?

36:38.365 --> 36:41.785
- Chevron one, encoded.
- Historic day, General.

36:42.202 --> 36:46.415
- Let's hope so, Senator.
- I was referring to your retirement.

36:54.798 --> 36:56.925
Chevron two, encoded.

36:57.050 --> 37:00.387
- Ambassador.
- Major. Is that what you're wearing?

37:04.057 --> 37:06.602
Sir, I have a lot to tell you,
and not a lot of time.

37:06.727 --> 37:10.772
- So, please, listen carefully.
- All right.

37:22.784 --> 37:25.787
- Mollem, Borren.
- Ambassador, Major Carter.

37:25.871 --> 37:29.124
- Colonel O'Neill is not here?
- Duties require him elsewhere.

37:29.249 --> 37:33.629
- Of course.
- It is my pleasure to offer a gesture.

37:34.296 --> 37:38.842
Coordinates and Stargate symbols
to several new worlds.

37:38.967 --> 37:41.512
It is our honour to receive such a gift.

37:48.393 --> 37:51.480
The coordinates are
on the hard drive in the laptop.

37:51.605 --> 37:53.899
It'll just take a moment to display.

38:00.405 --> 38:05.828
Our leaders would also like to extend an
invitation to Earth to formalise our treaty.

38:05.911 --> 38:08.372
All in time.

38:09.414 --> 38:14.336
By the way, Borren.
Would you read this aloud for me?

38:14.461 --> 38:17.297
- I couldn't quite translate it.
- Of course.

38:18.757 --> 38:21.301
"Sterility. "

38:27.307 --> 38:31.770
We knew what you were planning,
Mollem. This just confirms it.

38:33.981 --> 38:36.024
What are you talking about?

38:36.149 --> 38:40.112
"Vaccine Causes Sterility. "
That was the headline.

38:40.237 --> 38:45.659
You wiped out most of the Volians and
turned their entire world into farmland.

38:46.118 --> 38:49.037
You'd do the same to Earth.

38:51.331 --> 38:53.792
Lock them in here.
We have a treaty to conclude.

38:53.917 --> 38:56.253
If we don't come back alive,
the treaty is off.

38:56.378 --> 38:59.214
That'll be your loss.
We have what we wanted.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.310
I'm sorry.

39:13.353 --> 39:16.690
- What do you think they'll do?
- I don't know.

39:17.691 --> 39:21.153
O'Neill sent the note
to prevent this from happening.

39:25.324 --> 39:27.367
We were so sure.

39:27.493 --> 39:29.536
Listen.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.581
They're dialling the Stargate.

39:43.967 --> 39:46.345
They're dialling Earth.

39:48.931 --> 39:52.184
- What is that?
- I don't know, but we gotta find out.

39:59.942 --> 40:03.028
OK, when I get to the bottom,
follow me down.

40:03.111 --> 40:05.656
We'll only have
a few seconds over the gate.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.908
What?

40:10.452 --> 40:14.915
Just do what I tell you,
when I tell you. Trust me.

40:15.249 --> 40:17.292
OK.

40:43.902 --> 40:44.945
Where's Major Carter?

40:54.580 --> 40:56.623
Ambassador! Now!

41:10.804 --> 41:13.348
Go!

41:41.502 --> 41:43.545
Close the iris!

41:56.850 --> 42:00.687
- What in God's name is going on here?
- When they knew we were on to them,

42:00.812 --> 42:02.856
- they launched a bioweapon.
- Colonel.

42:02.981 --> 42:05.901
I had to warn you.
I couldn't wait for the ambassador.

42:05.984 --> 42:09.488
- Colonel, I asked you a question.
- You did good, Major.

42:09.613 --> 42:12.699
- Thank you, sir.
- Let's get her to the infirmary, now!

42:12.783 --> 42:15.118
Colonel!

42:15.244 --> 42:19.873
I swear, O'Neill, there's gonna be
an investigation into this.

42:20.749 --> 42:25.128
Well, that'd be fine. O'Neill! Two Ls.

42:31.468 --> 42:33.178
I guess we dodged a bullet there.

42:33.303 --> 42:36.139
Senator Kinsey appears most displeased.

42:36.431 --> 42:39.101
Yeah, that's a crying shame, isn't it?

42:40.102 --> 42:44.147
- Will we regret giving the addresses?
- I don't think we will.

42:44.273 --> 42:47.192
First one being a black hole, and all.

42:47.317 --> 42:50.070
They get progressively darker after that.

42:51.989 --> 42:54.032
Carter, you all right?

43:06.003 --> 43:08.589
