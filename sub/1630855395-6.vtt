WEBVTT

00:06.333 --> 00:08.541
[men yelling in distance]

00:08.625 --> 00:10.500
[soldier 1] Prepare for battle, lads!

00:12.000 --> 00:13.166
[blade rings]

00:13.250 --> 00:15.375
-[thumping]
-[soldier 2] Come! This is one!

00:16.375 --> 00:18.291
Should have chosen a side, witcher.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.708
[yelling]

00:20.791 --> 00:22.291
[soldier 3] Move! Move!

00:22.375 --> 00:24.083
[Dijkstra] The Redanian side.

00:24.166 --> 00:25.833
[soldier 3] Keep moving! Move it!

00:25.916 --> 00:27.916
[Dijkstra] A new day dawns,
Geralt of Rivia.

00:28.000 --> 00:29.750
[soldier 4] I swear,
if you say another word--

00:29.833 --> 00:32.083
I cannot let you leave
until we've done what we came to do.

00:32.166 --> 00:34.250
-[soldier 4] On whose orders?
-[woman screams]

00:34.333 --> 00:37.083
Lay down your weapon.
I'd hate to ask the boys to persuade you.

00:37.166 --> 00:39.625
-[soldier 5] Move it!
-[Artorius] You were one of us, Radcliffe.

00:39.708 --> 00:42.333
Why sell out the Brotherhood?
[grunts] Let go!

00:42.416 --> 00:44.666
-I'm a prisoner?
-[Artorius] Do you know what you're doing?

00:44.750 --> 00:46.375
-We're only here for mages.
-Get them out!

00:46.458 --> 00:49.166
Holding you is more of a… courtesy.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.250
[woman screams]

00:50.333 --> 00:52.333
After all, I see us as allies.

00:52.416 --> 00:53.583
[soldier 6] With me! This way!

00:53.666 --> 00:55.583
-[thumping]
-[woman yells]

00:55.666 --> 00:57.291
Fine. I'll comply.

00:57.375 --> 00:59.125
[soldier 4] That one! Take a stand!

00:59.875 --> 01:01.750
Piece of advice, though. [sighs]

01:01.833 --> 01:05.000
Coming after mages in their own home
during a conclave…

01:06.000 --> 01:07.541
-That's suicide.
-[Dijkstra] Hmm.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.000
[soldier 7] Many mages have already
joined us, mutant.

01:10.083 --> 01:12.250
-[woman 1] Come on!
-[Artaud] Take your hands off me!

01:12.333 --> 01:13.583
[Keira] Best to come peacefully.

01:13.666 --> 01:15.500
[Artaud] How much
did you pay these dogs, Keira?

01:15.583 --> 01:19.458
[Dijkstra] I do hope, for your sake, that
Yennefer chooses the right side as well.

01:20.208 --> 01:22.625
-[Yennefer speaking in Elder]
-[ringing sound]

01:23.458 --> 01:25.333
[voices whispering softly]

01:28.416 --> 01:29.916
[speaking in Elder]

01:30.000 --> 01:30.916
[voices sigh]

01:34.708 --> 01:35.916
-[whispers] Ciri.
-[thud]

01:36.000 --> 01:37.916
-[woman screaming]
-[soldier yelling]

01:41.041 --> 01:43.041
-[soldier 4] You, shut up!
-[door opens]

01:45.583 --> 01:48.833
[woman 1] Traitors to the Brotherhood,
you'll get what you deserve.

01:48.916 --> 01:50.541
-[Yennefer] Geralt.
-[woman 2] Please, sir!

01:50.625 --> 01:54.083
[soldier 8] Not so powerful with
dimeritium around your wrists, are ya?

01:54.166 --> 01:55.416
[grunting]

01:55.500 --> 01:56.916
[woman 2 sobs]

01:57.000 --> 01:58.958
-[door slams]
-[soldier 3] Come on, now!

02:05.708 --> 02:08.458
-[woman 3] I won't let you do this!
-[man] How can you do this?

02:08.541 --> 02:11.250
-[woman 2] You traitor!
-[soldier 3] Come on, come on!

02:11.333 --> 02:13.666
[Gerhart] Radcliffe, what are you doing?

02:14.875 --> 02:17.166
-[Radcliffe] Move it, old man!
-[woman 4] Help me!

02:20.125 --> 02:22.041
[soldier 3] Check the side rooms!

02:22.125 --> 02:24.291
-[soft ringing]
-[soldier 9] Bust that door!

02:24.375 --> 02:26.083
[rumbling]

02:27.541 --> 02:29.500
-[crash]
-[soldier 3] Check the rooms on the left!

02:33.166 --> 02:34.291
Can't have gone far.

02:36.375 --> 02:37.958
Where the fuck did she go?

02:38.708 --> 02:39.708
[Yennefer whispers] Ciri.

02:39.791 --> 02:41.041
[gasps]

02:41.125 --> 02:42.541
[tense music]

02:43.333 --> 02:45.333
[birdsong]

02:47.208 --> 02:49.208
[breathing softly]

02:59.500 --> 03:01.000
[soft whoosh]

03:18.208 --> 03:19.250
[Jaskier] Ahem.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.375
[Radovid gasps]

03:21.458 --> 03:23.625
-I was just--
-I know what you were doing.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.000
-You've got it wrong.
-I've got it wrong? I'm sorry.

03:27.083 --> 03:30.083
Which part? The part
where you feigned affection for me,

03:30.166 --> 03:34.250
or the part where you tried to kidnap
a young woman under my care

03:34.333 --> 03:35.750
whilst I slept?

03:39.750 --> 03:42.541
It would make everything easier for us
if she came to Redania.

03:44.666 --> 03:47.291
-I'd be out from under Dijkstra's thumb.
-And there it is.

03:48.666 --> 03:50.541
How can you think
my feelings for you are a lie?

03:50.625 --> 03:53.833
Because that is who you are, Radovid.

03:53.916 --> 03:55.333
At your core.

03:55.875 --> 03:58.250
I thought I'd seen through your mask.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.416
[whispers] Turns out
there was nothing behind it.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.250
[Radovid] I'm so sorry.

04:11.000 --> 04:11.833
Ciri.

04:11.916 --> 04:13.250
[breathing shakily]

04:15.000 --> 04:16.375
Oh, Ciri.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.416
[shouts] Ciri!

04:23.291 --> 04:24.458
[Jaskier] Ciri!

04:35.333 --> 04:37.500
[yelling]

04:39.500 --> 04:41.416
Armbands are a nice touch.

04:41.916 --> 04:44.375
[Sabrina] Helps us know
who's on the winning side.

04:45.041 --> 04:46.208
[Geralt] Prisoners?

04:46.708 --> 04:49.625
[Dijkstra] Traitors.
Strewn across the courts of the North.

04:49.708 --> 04:53.500
Spies weakening us
for Nilfgaard's march of conquest.

04:53.583 --> 04:55.916
-Are they all traitors?
-No.

04:56.416 --> 04:58.666
Just Vilgefortz and his cronies.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.500
The rest shall bear witness.

05:02.416 --> 05:05.458
This is an assault on magic. On all of us.

05:06.000 --> 05:08.041
-Redania seeks to--
-[soldier] Shut your mouth!

05:08.125 --> 05:09.375
-[Geralt] So.
-[sighs]

05:09.458 --> 05:11.833
[Geralt] If they are here to bear witness,

05:11.916 --> 05:15.166
then why are they bound in dimeritium?

05:16.208 --> 05:17.250
Our protection.

05:18.125 --> 05:21.416
We have ample evidence
of Vilgefortz aligning with Nilfgaard.

05:22.750 --> 05:24.375
We want to be heard.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.625
The Brotherhood needs our help

05:27.708 --> 05:30.000
to root out
these traitorous infestations.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.166
-So, this is a trial?
-[Philippa] No.

05:34.250 --> 05:35.666
A purge.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.000
[dramatic music]

05:51.000 --> 05:53.250
[Lydia, echoing] It's too late…
it's too late…

05:54.041 --> 05:56.000
You shouldn't have left the girl alone.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.708
…left the girl alone…

05:59.125 --> 06:02.000
[voices overlapping]
She belongs with my master.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.416
-[Yennefer] Lydia.
-[Lydia] And you… and you…

06:05.500 --> 06:07.666
you belong in the dirt… dirt…

06:07.750 --> 06:11.125
You must truly hate
what's left of your face to challenge me.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.208
[echoing] You were great in your time…
in your time…

06:13.291 --> 06:15.041
But that time has passed… has passed…

06:15.125 --> 06:17.833
My master has given me power beyond--

06:17.916 --> 06:20.250
Power beyond… power… power…

06:20.333 --> 06:22.208
[voices laughing]

06:24.875 --> 06:25.916
Yennefer.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.875
[Yennefer groans]

06:26.958 --> 06:28.166
[rumbling]

06:28.750 --> 06:30.000
Fight all you want.

06:30.083 --> 06:33.291
The Lion Cub will bend
to my master's will.

06:33.375 --> 06:36.416
That coward Vilgefortz? Never.

06:36.500 --> 06:39.208
You can't protect her if you're dead.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.958
[laughing]
Can't protect her if you're dead…

06:49.291 --> 06:50.541
[gasps]

06:53.583 --> 06:55.041
[Triss] There's a coup, Yen.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.041
I was hoping Istredd
and the others had made it down here.

06:58.916 --> 07:01.791
Does this mean I can count on you
to help me protect Ciri?

07:01.875 --> 07:03.333
Protecting her isn't enough.

07:04.166 --> 07:06.333
-You have to know that.
-[gasping]

07:07.083 --> 07:07.916
I do.

07:09.125 --> 07:11.916
She'll only master her power
if she masters herself.

07:13.500 --> 07:17.500
With us, Ciri will find
and fulfill her own destiny.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.208
Her destiny is with Vilgefortz.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.291
-Her blood will give him--
-[crunch]

07:21.375 --> 07:22.791
-[Yennefer] Nothing.
-[crack]

07:23.666 --> 07:24.875
[breathing heavily]

07:29.833 --> 07:31.541
[Yennefer] I have to get to Ciri.

07:31.625 --> 07:32.708
[Triss] This way.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.375
I'll find Tissaia. She'll know what to do.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.833
[Dijkstra] Finally, our headmistress.

07:39.916 --> 07:43.041
-[Marti] Tissaia, thank gods you're safe.
-[Rita] Please make this right.

07:43.125 --> 07:46.000
Keira! Radcliffe! Why wasn't she secured?

07:46.583 --> 07:49.291
I told them I would
melt their faces if they touched me.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.708
[Philippa] There'll be
no face melting here.

07:51.791 --> 07:55.041
I've shrouded your little kingdom
in a powerful binding spell.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.625
[Tissaia] Oh yes, I can feel it.

07:56.708 --> 07:59.333
From The Book of the Waning Sun.
I wrote that book.

07:59.416 --> 08:01.916
[Dijkstra] We will concede
you are the most powerful of mages.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.958
The beating heart of Aretuza.

08:04.041 --> 08:08.291
Where you go, the Brotherhood follows,
which is why we will be courteous.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.958
[Vilgefortz] She won't believe your lies.

08:10.041 --> 08:13.000
Your sad gambit to put all mages
in the service of Vizimir.

08:13.083 --> 08:15.333
Strike him,
you will not live to see sunset.

08:15.416 --> 08:16.416
There's no need.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.875
We have accounts of portals
bridging this place and Nilfgaard.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.541
Vilgefortz's portals.

08:22.583 --> 08:24.583
Why should anyone here believe you?

08:24.666 --> 08:28.000
[Radcliffe] Listen, we know
that you've tainted the Brotherhood

08:28.083 --> 08:31.125
by having that nasty bastard Rience
doing your dirty work.

08:31.208 --> 08:32.875
[Vilgefortz] Rience was ousted years ago.

08:32.958 --> 08:35.333
-[Radcliffe] Oh, was he?
-[Bianca] Shut your mouth, Radcliffe!

08:35.416 --> 08:37.333
And what of you, witcher?

08:37.458 --> 08:39.958
What is your stake?
Are you part of this insanity?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.125
I am not.

08:41.916 --> 08:44.416
Nor do I think the accusations insane.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.833
You did know this was coming.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.875
You admitted as much last night.

08:48.958 --> 08:51.500
First Stregobor, now Vilgefortz?
Who will it be next?

08:51.583 --> 08:53.583
The powers that threaten the Continent,

08:53.666 --> 08:56.500
Philippa and Dijkstra,
are who should be on trial here.

08:57.708 --> 09:01.166
I don't give a shit
about Brotherhood politics.

09:05.041 --> 09:07.208
There's an unnatural fog in the bay.

09:07.291 --> 09:08.583
[Radcliffe] What do you mean?

09:08.666 --> 09:10.708
Someone's using magic to conceal ships.

09:10.791 --> 09:11.833
Don't you see?

09:11.916 --> 09:13.333
It's a Redanian army.

09:13.416 --> 09:14.958
Here to support their treachery.

09:15.041 --> 09:17.000
To destroy everything we have worked for.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.541
I must give Aplegatt a large boon.

09:19.625 --> 09:21.625
[dramatic music]

09:31.833 --> 09:34.000
Tissaia, you must break the binding spell.

09:34.625 --> 09:38.458
You'll only delay the inevitable.
Vilgefortz will be exposed today.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.708
She spurned you
for what you had to do at Sodden Hill.

09:40.791 --> 09:42.041
[Geralt] Whoever they are,

09:42.625 --> 09:43.833
they're moving closer.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.375
-Break the binding spell.
-Shut him up!

09:47.541 --> 09:49.458
[whispering in Elder]

09:50.458 --> 09:51.333
[Dijkstra] Sabrina?

09:51.416 --> 09:52.458
[Sabrina] Oh, fuck!

09:53.416 --> 09:55.416
-[Dijkstra] Anybody, stop her!
-[metal snapping]

09:55.500 --> 09:57.416
[speaking in Elder]

09:58.541 --> 10:00.625
Death to Redania.

10:00.708 --> 10:01.916
-[whoosh]
-[soldier yelps]

10:02.000 --> 10:05.500
There's no rush, Geralt. I can assure you,
if you're looking for the girl,

10:05.583 --> 10:07.000
you're too late.

10:07.083 --> 10:08.875
[soldier] Fuckin' witcher.

10:10.541 --> 10:11.666
[Geralt] Dijkstra!

10:12.333 --> 10:13.541
[door slams]

10:14.291 --> 10:15.250
[sighs]

10:16.000 --> 10:16.833
Geralt.

10:17.541 --> 10:19.208
Let's not do anything rash.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.291
You know what?

10:26.541 --> 10:28.625
I'll just tell you where we've taken her.

10:32.291 --> 10:33.458
[Dijkstra cries out]

10:33.541 --> 10:35.416
You-- you can't blame a man for trying.

10:35.500 --> 10:36.625
-[crack]
-[screams]

10:36.708 --> 10:38.166
[groans]

10:41.125 --> 10:42.083
[groaning]

10:42.166 --> 10:44.291
You-- you'll never get away with this.

10:44.375 --> 10:47.791
[groans] I've got 50 men
coming on those boats.

10:47.875 --> 10:49.958
Best hope one of them's a barber surgeon.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.208
-[crunch]
-[screams]

11:00.875 --> 11:02.166
-[soldier yelps]
-Mmm…

11:05.416 --> 11:07.750
I should have known better, friend.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.875
No. You should've paid
more attention… friend.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.958
[Vilgefortz] I'm finished here.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.041
-[Marti] We'll take it from here, Tissaia.
-[man] Move!

11:22.583 --> 11:24.166
Don't ever come back here.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.250
[fighting continues]

11:41.416 --> 11:42.500
[Tissaia] Vilgefortz!

11:43.125 --> 11:44.625
We can take the Redanians out

11:44.708 --> 11:47.250
if we unite our Chaos
and trap them in the tunnels.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.000
That won't be happening.

11:51.125 --> 11:53.416
The Scoia'tael will enter this place

11:53.500 --> 11:56.375
and burn it to the ground
in the name of the White Flame.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.541
The Scoia'tael?

11:59.458 --> 12:00.625
What are you talking--

12:05.041 --> 12:06.125
Why?

12:07.583 --> 12:08.458
This is our home.

12:08.541 --> 12:09.625
No, Tissaia.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.000
This is your home.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.208
I don't care who sacks it.

12:15.625 --> 12:17.750
I have my own aims.

12:17.833 --> 12:19.708
And they no longer include you.

12:21.416 --> 12:22.833
[softly] How could you?

12:23.375 --> 12:26.291
[Vilgefortz] Stregobor, with his pride,
was easy to set up.

12:26.375 --> 12:30.875
And you, with your undying trust,
were easy to fool.

12:37.291 --> 12:41.000
[Tissaia] Vilgefortz, please.
Please, do not do this!

12:41.708 --> 12:44.041
[overlapping whispering in Elder]

12:45.666 --> 12:47.166
[thump]

12:47.666 --> 12:49.375
-[Tissaia] Vilgefortz.
-[rumbling]

12:51.625 --> 12:54.458
[Vilgefortz] Poor Tissaia.
Such a failure of judgment.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.416
[Tissaia gasps]

12:55.500 --> 12:57.333
[stone grinding]

12:58.916 --> 13:00.583
[swooshing sounds]

13:01.083 --> 13:02.625
[soldiers marching]

13:25.208 --> 13:27.958
Today, we reclaim Aretuza as our own

13:28.041 --> 13:31.583
and we bring
the Elder Blood princess home.

13:31.666 --> 13:32.833
[scoffs]

13:45.916 --> 13:50.291
You will never take Aretuza.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.750
[Cahir] Archers!

13:59.583 --> 14:01.208
On my go!

14:02.875 --> 14:03.708
Now!

14:10.125 --> 14:12.375
-Help! We need help!
-Dimeritium tipped arrows.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.875
The archers are the priority!

14:13.958 --> 14:15.708
Disarm and deflect!

14:15.791 --> 14:17.625
If you find the girl, bring her to me.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.083
Go! Go!

14:26.083 --> 14:27.583
Go! Go!

14:37.250 --> 14:38.416
[Yennefer] Ciri!

14:40.083 --> 14:41.125
[Ciri] Yennefer!

14:41.958 --> 14:43.958
[wind whistling]

14:45.000 --> 14:46.083
Ciri.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.458
Ciri!

14:51.083 --> 14:52.750
[sobs] You're alive.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.666
[breathing shakily]
I dreamt you and Geralt were gone.

14:55.750 --> 14:57.666
We'll never leave you.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.291
Never! You know that.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.875
You were dead.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.625
We need to get away from this island
as fast as possible.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.791
The chain ferry. Come on.

15:12.541 --> 15:13.916
Yen, what about Geralt?

15:16.750 --> 15:17.916
He'll find us.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.458
He always finds us.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.125
Come on.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.791
[Bianca] No!

15:46.583 --> 15:47.958
[Filavandrel] Francesca!

15:48.041 --> 15:49.791
-[yells]
-[roars]

15:50.416 --> 15:53.500
[screaming] No!

15:53.583 --> 15:54.625
[elfyn] That's not fair!

15:54.708 --> 15:55.958
[heartbeat]

16:00.208 --> 16:02.000
[mournful music]

16:03.750 --> 16:05.125
[Rita] Your Chaos, Tissaia!

16:05.625 --> 16:07.541
-[sobbing]
-[heartbeat continues]

16:14.791 --> 16:16.791
[Rita] Artorius! She's unarmed.

16:16.875 --> 16:17.875
-Take her now!
-[roars]

16:19.500 --> 16:21.166
[spluttering]
-[Rita] Oh, gods!

16:21.250 --> 16:22.750
[elf] Kill them all!

16:25.708 --> 16:26.708
Kill!

16:27.333 --> 16:28.583
Goodbye, Uncle.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.416
[Tissaia] Artorius!

16:30.500 --> 16:32.041
[both gasping]

16:34.083 --> 16:35.291
Artorius!

16:35.375 --> 16:36.500
You've got to fight.

16:36.583 --> 16:37.500
[heartbeat]

16:37.583 --> 16:38.875
You've got to fight!

16:39.708 --> 16:40.958
[groans]

16:41.041 --> 16:42.416
[elf] Come on!

16:55.708 --> 16:57.708
[rumbling]

16:57.791 --> 16:58.958
[crashing]

17:06.458 --> 17:07.333
[sighs]

17:12.125 --> 17:13.166
Run!

17:17.458 --> 17:19.458
[Fringilla screaming]

17:20.166 --> 17:22.166
[wind whistling]

17:27.833 --> 17:29.291
We're almost at the stables.

17:32.416 --> 17:33.416
[Ciri] Fire fucker!

17:38.375 --> 17:39.541
Enough!

17:39.625 --> 17:41.958
You won't kill her.
Your master wants her alive.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.958
I have no master.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.583
I'm going to remove my sword,

17:48.750 --> 17:49.958
going to leave it here,

17:50.750 --> 17:51.958
and back away.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.458
You were right about Vilgefortz.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.875
He's at the center of all this.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.000
He brought both Nilfgaard
and the Scoia'tael.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.458
They're all searching for you, Ciri.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.791
We have to get off this island.

18:16.916 --> 18:18.541
[screaming]

18:27.083 --> 18:28.666
[woman] No! Oh god!

18:36.458 --> 18:37.333
[both grunt]

18:54.291 --> 18:56.208
Tissaia! We have to take cover.

18:56.916 --> 18:59.083
-[Marti] Archers up top!
-[Rita] Get them!

19:00.333 --> 19:02.833
-We need more help!
-[Istredd] Marti, over here!

19:14.875 --> 19:16.083
Triss! [gasps]

19:17.541 --> 19:19.375
Tissaia needs us! Hurry!

19:19.458 --> 19:22.666
Listen to me.
These elves, they still need you.

19:22.750 --> 19:25.208
We all followed you here
because we believe in your strength.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.125
I, too, thought I'd lost everything,

19:27.208 --> 19:29.583
but there is always
something to fight for.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.250
This is our fight,
and we can win, but together.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.208
[Marti] The doors are magically sealed!

19:50.916 --> 19:51.958
[Tissaia] Let's go!

19:55.333 --> 19:57.458
-[Triss] Gerhart!
-[Artaud] He's having a heart attack.

19:57.541 --> 19:58.958
-Take him!
-[Triss] Okay.

19:59.541 --> 20:01.791
-Istredd, help!
-[Istredd] Come on, this way.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.500
This way, Triss.

20:03.583 --> 20:05.583
-[explosion]
-[screaming]

20:08.125 --> 20:10.416
-[Triss] Hold on, Gerhart.
-[Istredd] Put him there.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.208
-[Gerhart] My heart…
-[Triss] I've got you.

20:12.291 --> 20:14.208
-[man] Tissaia! We need help!
-[woman] Tissaia!

20:14.291 --> 20:16.416
-[Gerhart] My heart! [groans]
-[Triss] Easy…

20:17.875 --> 20:20.250
-[Istredd] No!
-[Keira] We wanted to stop Vilgefortz.

20:20.333 --> 20:22.791
[Istredd] You made your choice, traitors!

20:23.500 --> 20:25.958
Hate us today, punish us tomorrow.

20:26.458 --> 20:28.666
They will not destroy this place, Tissaia.

20:28.750 --> 20:31.250
This is our home. Let us fight with you.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.375
For you.

20:36.375 --> 20:37.291
With me!

20:39.916 --> 20:41.583
[Gerhart] Don't waste your Chaos.

20:43.458 --> 20:44.666
[Triss] Gerhart, no.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.666
-[Gerhart] Leave me, Triss.
-[Triss] You're going to be fine!

20:49.750 --> 20:51.708
-I promise.
-It's too late.

20:54.250 --> 20:55.333
No, it isn't.

20:56.916 --> 20:58.375
We'll keep on fighting--

20:58.458 --> 21:00.500
-[gasping]
-Triss! No!

21:00.583 --> 21:01.875
Triss…

21:01.958 --> 21:03.833
Tissaia, it's okay.
We'll find another way.

21:03.916 --> 21:05.916
-It's okay. I need to take it out.
-[Triss gasping]

21:06.000 --> 21:08.083
Tissaia! Gah!

21:08.166 --> 21:10.416
-Triss, I need to take it out, okay?
-[Triss whimpering]

21:10.500 --> 21:13.375
I'll take it out.
Breathe. You're gonna be okay. Breathe.

21:18.166 --> 21:20.166
[tense music]

21:28.125 --> 21:31.041
-[Triss groaning]
-It's almost over. It's almost over.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.958
[Istredd yells]

21:34.041 --> 21:35.875
-[groans]
-Look at me. Look at me.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.625
-Look at me. Breathe. Yeah?
-[gasping]

21:41.125 --> 21:44.166
If they're inside,
if they're sacking the whole place…

21:44.708 --> 21:45.625
-The book!
-Yeah.

21:45.708 --> 21:49.416
Tissaia hid it, so Vilgefortz will know
if he orchestrated this whole thing.

21:49.500 --> 21:52.250
-Now, you understand.
-I'll be okay. Go.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.583
But don't let it get into the wrong hands.

21:55.250 --> 21:56.875
I need you to be okay.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.125
I need you.

21:58.208 --> 21:59.250
Marti, help her!

22:07.750 --> 22:09.750
[somber music]

22:38.000 --> 22:39.708
[speaking in Elder]

22:43.000 --> 22:44.458
[thunder rumbling]

22:45.833 --> 22:46.833
[Yennefer] Tissaia.

22:49.583 --> 22:50.750
What's wrong, Yen?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.416
Yen.

22:53.916 --> 22:55.666
She's summoning Alzur's Thunder.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.416
[Ciri] A spell of last resort.

23:03.333 --> 23:04.708
[wind howling]

23:08.041 --> 23:09.291
Go to her.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.083
We'll be all right.

23:11.166 --> 23:12.791
-No.
-She has no choice.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.541
I understand what she means to you.

23:18.625 --> 23:21.500
To know she suffers, she fights,

23:23.250 --> 23:24.541
that she may die.

23:25.291 --> 23:27.333
We didn't come this far
to abandon each other.

23:27.416 --> 23:28.916
Then don't abandon me.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.375
I have to do this.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.250
[sniffles]

23:36.333 --> 23:37.833
I've searched so long.

23:38.791 --> 23:40.041
Fought so long.

23:41.041 --> 23:42.416
Hurt so many.

23:42.500 --> 23:43.916
And it was all worth it.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.375
[thunder rumbling]

23:48.458 --> 23:52.583
No matter where you go or where you hide,
we will never be apart.

23:53.208 --> 23:54.500
[sobs]

23:54.583 --> 23:56.250
Destiny brought us together.

23:57.291 --> 23:59.416
Never lost. Always found.

24:02.625 --> 24:04.916
I love you, my daughter.

24:08.291 --> 24:09.375
Come back to us.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.625
[emotional music]

24:18.375 --> 24:20.416
[thunder crashing]

24:22.375 --> 24:24.833
[speaking in Elder]

24:25.833 --> 24:27.833
[repeating spell]

24:52.666 --> 24:54.000
[Cahir] Fringilla!

24:55.208 --> 24:57.958
-I thought you were dead.
-No. Not dead.

24:58.041 --> 24:59.583
[explosion]

24:59.666 --> 25:01.750
I'm simply no longer confined, Cahir.

25:01.833 --> 25:05.250
You know, it is amazing what you can do
when you think for yourself.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.875
[explosion]

25:10.625 --> 25:13.625
There's a good chance
the girl has already fled the building.

25:13.708 --> 25:16.958
Take a search party and go.
Tissaia's life's mine.

25:17.541 --> 25:18.666
Then take her.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.541
[speaking in Elder]

25:28.041 --> 25:29.791
[rumbling]

25:36.416 --> 25:38.208
[gasping] No.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.541
[thunder crashing]

25:51.958 --> 25:53.791
[screams]

26:01.500 --> 26:03.750
Take cover!

26:05.625 --> 26:07.416
[roaring]

26:09.916 --> 26:11.208
[roar echoing]

26:11.291 --> 26:12.750
[energy crackling]

26:14.250 --> 26:16.083
[thunder rumbling]

26:18.916 --> 26:20.333
[soft whoosh]

26:27.791 --> 26:29.125
Thank you for the book.

26:30.708 --> 26:32.583
But it's not the only thing I want.

26:32.666 --> 26:33.916
I'll see you soon.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.041
[groaning]

26:43.708 --> 26:45.333
[Artaud chuckles]

26:45.833 --> 26:47.083
[groans] Ugh.

26:47.625 --> 26:49.458
Hello, Sigismund.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.916
[chuckles]

26:51.541 --> 26:54.583
Madness that you thought
you could control us.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.708
All alone now, are we?

26:58.833 --> 26:59.750
Mmm.

27:01.166 --> 27:02.458
-[squishing]
-[moans]

27:04.458 --> 27:06.250
-[ringing]
-I got one for you.

27:07.333 --> 27:08.958
I think you'll like this one.

27:10.375 --> 27:14.625
What do you call a spymaster
when all of his spies have fled?

27:15.458 --> 27:16.375
Hmm?

27:17.583 --> 27:19.541
The answer is "dead."

27:19.625 --> 27:20.750
[screeching]

27:23.083 --> 27:25.208
-[slashing]
-[Artaud screaming]

27:27.833 --> 27:30.375
-[screams fade]
-[owl screeching]

27:31.416 --> 27:33.083
-[loud fluttering]
-[whoosh]

27:33.166 --> 27:34.375
-[whimpers]
-[thunder rumbling]

27:34.458 --> 27:37.375
-Vilgefortz outplayed us. We must move.
-[groans]

27:38.500 --> 27:40.625
Tissaia's using Alzur's Thunder.

27:40.708 --> 27:42.333
[wails]

27:42.416 --> 27:44.583
It will kill anyone she lays eyes on.

27:44.666 --> 27:46.166
How did the Squirrels beat us here?

27:46.250 --> 27:48.500
Ah, either they met
and defeated our reinforcements--

27:48.583 --> 27:50.791
-Or I hired the wrong messenger.
-Hmm.

27:50.875 --> 27:52.041
Can you cast a portal?

27:52.125 --> 27:55.000
No. Not until we get
some distance from Tor Lara.

27:55.916 --> 27:58.333
-Good thing you enjoy pain.
-[yelps]

27:58.958 --> 28:00.958
[somber music]

28:12.833 --> 28:14.791
[Geralt] We need to get down there.

28:15.708 --> 28:17.000
[horse neighs]

28:22.583 --> 28:23.458
[Ciri gasps]

28:26.000 --> 28:27.916
-It's him.
-[whinnying]

28:29.041 --> 28:32.125
-He's mine.
-There's no coming back from this.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.416
Back to what?

28:34.208 --> 28:35.208
To my home he burned?

28:35.958 --> 28:37.625
To my family he killed?

28:37.708 --> 28:39.666
He's haunted my nightmares ever since.

28:41.125 --> 28:43.083
But I'm not afraid of him anymore.

28:44.583 --> 28:46.583
[thunder crashing]

28:50.583 --> 28:51.916
[neighing]

28:52.583 --> 28:56.125
[Cahir] Princess,
I've dreamt of this moment.

28:59.625 --> 29:01.250
-[Ciri grunts]
-[Cahir] No!

29:09.583 --> 29:10.708
[screams]

29:11.500 --> 29:13.416
[Cahir] I do not wish to fight you!

29:13.500 --> 29:14.416
Pick it up!

29:14.500 --> 29:15.458
[Ciri panting]

29:16.083 --> 29:17.083
Pick it up!

29:18.083 --> 29:19.416
-[whimpers]
-Why?

29:20.083 --> 29:22.083
In the attack in Cintra, when I took you,

29:22.166 --> 29:24.333
I did everything I was asked
with no hesitation,

29:24.416 --> 29:26.583
but now, I can't stop asking questions.

29:27.375 --> 29:29.500
I've discovered I was wrong!

29:30.083 --> 29:32.375
I can't give you back the life I stole.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.750
[growls]

29:33.833 --> 29:35.125
[gasping]

29:41.833 --> 29:43.083
My life is yours.

29:44.916 --> 29:45.791
So take it.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.666
[Ciri sobs]

29:53.750 --> 29:54.583
You took…

29:56.125 --> 29:57.916
everything from me.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.041
[Cahir] I know.

30:01.916 --> 30:02.875
I know.

30:06.208 --> 30:07.458
Take this blade,

30:08.750 --> 30:11.458
and let yours be
the last face I see in this world.

30:13.708 --> 30:14.916
Princess Cirilla.

30:16.208 --> 30:17.958
The Lion Cub of Cintra.

30:18.833 --> 30:22.125
She who has the power to move the world.

30:24.291 --> 30:25.375
I owe you that.

30:28.958 --> 30:29.916
Do it.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.500
And forgive me.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.083
Forgive me.

30:38.625 --> 30:40.583
-[panting]
-[horses neighing]

30:41.666 --> 30:43.416
-Yah!
-[Cahir] The Scoia'tael.

30:43.500 --> 30:44.458
Go.

30:45.833 --> 30:47.083
I will find you.

30:47.166 --> 30:49.541
[faint, whispering voices]

30:50.125 --> 30:51.541
-Ciri.
-[gasps]

30:51.625 --> 30:53.208
[neighing]

31:01.083 --> 31:02.291
-[man] Stop!
-No!

31:10.250 --> 31:12.000
[wheezes]

31:12.083 --> 31:14.583
[energy pulsing]

31:20.541 --> 31:22.125
Let's end this.

31:23.333 --> 31:25.500
One last stand. We keep what's ours.

31:26.041 --> 31:28.083
-Come on.
-[coughing]

31:43.791 --> 31:46.666
-Stand back or die.
-[Yennefer] No!

31:47.583 --> 31:48.958
[shrieks]

31:51.083 --> 31:53.083
[Yennefer] You will not take what is ours.

31:53.666 --> 31:56.000
[Francesca] You're outnumbered.
You have no choice.

31:56.083 --> 32:00.583
-Go to hell, you fucking mongrels!
-[all gasp]

32:01.666 --> 32:02.916
I'll show you the way!

32:03.916 --> 32:05.500
[Fringilla] He's tapping into fire magic.

32:07.833 --> 32:08.875
Go.

32:08.958 --> 32:11.208
I'll buy you some time.

32:11.291 --> 32:13.416
I've been waiting for this moment.

32:14.500 --> 32:15.333
[Yennefer] Go!

32:15.916 --> 32:17.458
Triss, find Geralt.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.416
Falka will be waiting for you.

32:36.833 --> 32:38.125
Help me move this.

32:39.375 --> 32:41.333
[ringing]

32:46.166 --> 32:47.000
Ciri.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.541
Go.

32:49.625 --> 32:52.166
[Ciri] I'm not leaving you.
I can help you.

32:52.250 --> 32:54.458
Never lost, always found. Go.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
[thunder crashing]

33:53.666 --> 33:55.666
[wind gusting]

34:01.916 --> 34:04.125
[blade rings]

34:05.875 --> 34:08.083
[Vilgefortz] So,
we have an epilogue, then.

34:12.541 --> 34:17.583
The dénouement
that draws the play to a close.

34:19.458 --> 34:20.833
Or is it fate?

34:20.916 --> 34:22.458
[staff rings]

34:30.708 --> 34:32.291
You know where she's going.

34:35.041 --> 34:36.000
Tor Lara.

34:37.250 --> 34:38.750
And there is no way out.

34:40.458 --> 34:41.583
It's all over.

34:41.666 --> 34:42.958
No way out?

34:43.500 --> 34:44.708
I'm glad to hear it.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.791
That means there's only one way in.

34:48.625 --> 34:50.166
And you'll never reach it.

34:51.541 --> 34:53.083
You're a wise man, Geralt.

34:54.625 --> 34:55.583
A lot like me.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.208
A warrior. Touched by magic.

35:00.458 --> 35:01.958
Alone in a world he never made.

35:03.208 --> 35:06.500
Enough with your parallels.
You lack originality.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.041
Even more so
with Emhyr pulling your strings.

35:09.125 --> 35:10.750
I have no strings.

35:11.791 --> 35:14.208
Nilfgaard will get what it wants,
as will I.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.458
You may consider me your opponent,

35:16.541 --> 35:19.000
but it is you who is the enemy
of good today, Geralt.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.583
I grow tired of asking.

35:21.666 --> 35:23.500
And I grow tired of answering.

35:24.958 --> 35:26.625
I will not be your partner.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.833
I will not join your fight.

35:30.708 --> 35:32.583
Arrogance will be your undoing.

35:34.250 --> 35:37.500
And steel will be yours.

35:47.416 --> 35:48.791
You like my staff?

35:59.125 --> 36:00.791
Know what the hardest part was?

36:01.291 --> 36:02.333
Holding back!

36:03.708 --> 36:05.333
Hiding my real skills,

36:06.041 --> 36:09.083
knowing I could take any life at any time.

36:10.208 --> 36:12.583
It was… exasperating.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.416
Today, I hold back no more.

36:40.083 --> 36:42.125
[groans]

36:46.125 --> 36:47.750
[thunder rumbling]

37:01.458 --> 37:03.916
-[whispering voices]
-[blade rings]

37:10.291 --> 37:11.958
[echoing thunder]

37:16.708 --> 37:18.208
[gasping]

37:19.916 --> 37:22.208
-[Stregobor] Die, abominations!
-[Tissaia] No!

37:23.958 --> 37:25.458
-No! No…
-Fall back!

37:26.791 --> 37:28.458
-It's over.
-[groans]

37:38.125 --> 37:39.541
[staff rings]

37:40.916 --> 37:42.250
[groans]

37:55.333 --> 37:56.208
[sighs]

38:14.083 --> 38:17.083
-[Geralt yells]
-[Vilgefortz roars] Hah!

38:17.166 --> 38:18.041
[growls]

38:18.125 --> 38:20.833
[Vilgefortz] I could smash your brain out
through your ears.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.166
Make a friend of this pain,
Geralt of Rivia.

38:30.000 --> 38:30.875
Today…

38:34.958 --> 38:36.708
you begin your new life,

38:36.791 --> 38:38.833
as my warning to the Continent!

38:45.500 --> 38:47.250
This was supposed to be a lesson.

38:49.625 --> 38:50.583
-[crunch]
-[screams]

38:52.875 --> 38:54.208
[wheezes]

38:55.875 --> 38:58.083
But you were mistaken, witcher.

38:58.708 --> 39:01.625
You mistook the stars
reflected on a pond at night…

39:03.500 --> 39:04.791
for the sky.

39:05.833 --> 39:07.000
I shall see you later.

39:08.583 --> 39:09.750
One day.

39:09.833 --> 39:11.125
Perhaps.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.375
[groans]

39:14.916 --> 39:17.166
[shuddering]

39:20.583 --> 39:22.250
[poignant music]

39:43.708 --> 39:45.291
[Ciri gasping]

39:50.875 --> 39:52.125
[energy crackling]

40:03.833 --> 40:06.291
-[Vilgefortz] I didn't come to hurt you.
-[yelps]

40:06.375 --> 40:08.458
-[blade clattering]
-[gasps]

40:09.166 --> 40:12.500
[Vilgefortz, echoing] All I want is
to share my knowledge with you.

40:12.583 --> 40:16.083
It was smart for you
to join the witcher and Yennefer.

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
But we both know
they couldn't properly train you.

40:20.916 --> 40:23.208
Only I can show you the way.

40:23.833 --> 40:26.250
Only I know what your powers can do.

40:28.041 --> 40:30.666
Please, Cirilla. Let me help you.

40:32.541 --> 40:34.166
Be my pupil.

40:36.333 --> 40:38.333
[wind whistling]

40:38.416 --> 40:40.416
[mournful music]

40:42.083 --> 40:43.583
[scraping]

40:48.166 --> 40:49.958
[bursts of energy]

40:55.541 --> 40:57.541
[hissing]

40:59.458 --> 41:01.166
What are you trying to tell me?

41:03.208 --> 41:05.125
[chittering]

41:08.625 --> 41:09.708
Please.

41:11.416 --> 41:12.458
[growling]

41:13.458 --> 41:15.083
[echoing] I can hear you… can hear you…

41:18.000 --> 41:19.666
[buzzing]

41:23.125 --> 41:24.583
-[female voice] Yes.
-[Ciri] Yes.

41:25.083 --> 41:26.833
[Ciri's echo] I understand…

41:26.916 --> 41:29.208
-I understand.
-[female voice and Ciri] I understand…

41:29.875 --> 41:31.750
[Vilgefortz] What are you doing?

41:32.333 --> 41:34.250
You don't know
what you're playing with, Cirilla…

41:34.333 --> 41:35.791
…what you're playing with, Cirilla…

41:36.625 --> 41:38.625
-You are not ready!
-…ready…

41:38.708 --> 41:39.875
[loud hissing]

41:42.000 --> 41:45.541
-You are not ready for this kind of power!
-You are not ready for this kind of power!

41:46.166 --> 41:48.208
[rumbling and hissing]

41:49.166 --> 41:50.750
-But together…
-…together…

41:52.166 --> 41:54.250
we can change this Continent!

41:55.250 --> 41:56.916
-[screams]
-[bursts of energy]

42:15.750 --> 42:17.041
[poignant music]

42:17.958 --> 42:19.500
[muffled explosions]

42:33.250 --> 42:34.583
Can you hear me?

42:35.583 --> 42:37.416
-I'll take you to safety.
-[groans]

42:38.833 --> 42:41.875
[Francesca] Where is the girl?
Have the scouts returned?

42:42.416 --> 42:44.791
-Did Cahir capture her?
-They haven't returned.

42:45.958 --> 42:47.250
[gasping]

42:54.875 --> 42:56.875
[emotional music]
