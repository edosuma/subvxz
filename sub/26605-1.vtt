- Go for it.
- Just do it.

01:45.321 --> 01:49.619
Fuck.
Oh, my. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:56.988 --> 01:57.853
Oh.

01:58.254 --> 01:59.154
Oh.

01:59.953 --> 02:00.720
I think she has her period.

02:14.121 --> 02:16.020
Camille, go to the bathroom
and check it.

02:16.786 --> 02:17.953
It's not my period.

02:18.321 --> 02:19.519
Just saying, yo.

02:20.087 --> 02:21.087
I think she's, like...

02:21.987 --> 02:22.886
she's bleeding.

02:23.820 --> 02:25.254
It looked
the blood was rushing down.

02:32.853 --> 02:33.853
Still okay?

03:33.220 --> 03:34.719
<i>Your mother is a whore.</i>

03:35.087 --> 03:35.987
<i>Oh.</i>

03:40.585 --> 03:41.652
<i>Your mother is a whore.</i>

03:42.618 --> 03:43.518
<i>Oh.</i>

04:24.019 --> 04:24.986
How did it go?

04:26.052 --> 04:28.017
What do you mean?
They just took out the stitches.

04:28.019 --> 04:31.618
I mean,
did it hurt or anything?

04:32.652 --> 04:35.119
No, it took like two seconds.

04:39.986 --> 04:41.652
No more skating.
Promise me.

04:48.019 --> 04:49.652
Mom.

04:53.219 --> 04:54.850
No!
What are you talking about?

05:05.986 --> 05:07.219
All right, fine. All right.

05:08.618 --> 05:09.517
I promise.

05:57.584 --> 05:58.484
Just stuff.

08:14.150 --> 08:15.750
You wanna get
the fuck out of the way?

08:43.984 --> 08:46.850
Hey! What's up?

08:48.149 --> 08:49.017
Hi.

08:49.216 --> 08:50.581
What's your name?

08:50.583 --> 08:52.082
- Camille.
- Are you from here?

08:52.084 --> 08:53.648
Janay, Janay,
Janay, Janay.

08:53.650 --> 08:56.149
That girl just fingered me
in the bushes, bro.

08:56.783 --> 08:58.648
Oh, my gosh!
What is wrong with you.

08:58.650 --> 09:01.147
She just put her fingers
in my pussy.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.214
- Not right now!
- Come on, give me a dab.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.850
No. This is Camille.

09:05.216 --> 09:08.249
- Hi.
- Hi. You look familiar.

09:08.883 --> 09:12.017
I follow you on Instagram, bro!
Yo, I follow her on Instagram.

09:12.583 --> 09:13.616
She's mad good.

09:14.683 --> 09:16.083
Aren't you, like,
from New Jersey or something?

09:16.616 --> 09:17.650
Long Island.

09:17.950 --> 09:19.948
Oh, that's the same shit
to me bro.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.216
It's not in New York City.

09:22.750 --> 09:23.881
Oh, this is Ruby.

09:23.883 --> 09:25.050
- Yeah, that's Ruby.
- Hi.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.750
She keeps her hand
on her camera.

09:29.984 --> 09:31.717
She gonna catch a clip,
Long Island?

09:33.116 --> 09:35.114
Come on, Long Island,
let's get a clip!

09:35.116 --> 09:37.717
- I'll try
- KURT: You'll try? Cool.

09:37.984 --> 09:40.482
Let's get it, first try. Go, go!

09:44.850 --> 09:47.582
Damn.
Too many penises in the way.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.216
That was good, though.

09:53.283 --> 09:54.482
Oh, shit.

10:10.749 --> 10:12.615
Ah. Again!

10:12.882 --> 10:14.613
That shit was valid!

10:14.615 --> 10:16.749
Oh, nice!

10:20.582 --> 10:21.582
First try.

10:25.116 --> 10:26.116
Hey, can you do an ollie?

10:27.849 --> 10:29.216
No, bro, I'm a poser.

10:30.649 --> 10:31.882
That's why I have this shit.

10:35.615 --> 10:37.249
I thought this was just
an accessory.

10:37.716 --> 10:39.515
- It's my purse.
- That's your bag.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.082
Yeah, that's my bag.

10:42.015 --> 10:43.849
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:46.882 --> 10:47.882
Ruby.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.281
Indigo, this Camille.
She hit us up on the 'gram.

10:50.283 --> 10:51.482
Cool.

11:01.282 --> 11:03.046

Hey.

13:42.014 --> 13:42.947
Hey, what's up?

13:43.814 --> 13:45.081
I just came here
to skate.

13:46.314 --> 13:48.480
I'm about to leave to go meet
the girls. You should come.

13:50.314 --> 13:52.214
- Okay. Yeah.
- Let's go.

14:00.714 --> 14:04.947
- Give me your board,
- KURT: Yo, just hop over! Damn.

14:46.613 --> 14:47.613
I'm good.

14:49.046 --> 14:50.647
They don't have weed
in Long Island?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.113
I mean, New Jersey,
I mean, Long Island.

14:55.281 --> 14:56.813
Damn,
it's so chill here.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.746
But I get so sick of this city.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.744
I just wanna go to, like,
the fucking mountains

15:02.746 --> 15:05.146
and make artwork, ceramics.

15:05.846 --> 15:07.746
Nobody can fucking find me.

15:09.113 --> 15:12.246
I'm swaying.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.879
You know the show
<i>Sex in the City?</i>

15:17.613 --> 15:19.944
- Yes.
- No, you don't.

15:19.946 --> 15:22.879
You watch the show
<i>Sex and the City,</i> bitch.

15:23.280 --> 15:24.877
What are you talking about?

15:24.879 --> 15:25.913
Okay, listen!

15:27.280 --> 15:28.611
- What are you talking about?
- Yo, you're too high!

15:28.613 --> 15:29.613
You're too high.

15:30.813 --> 15:31.777
No, I'm not, I know
what the fuck I'm talking about.

15:31.779 --> 15:32.811
No, you don't!

15:32.813 --> 15:34.879
Kit Kats and <i>Sex and the City,</i>

15:35.113 --> 15:38.744
and also, the motherfucking
Monopoly man. Okay?

15:38.746 --> 15:40.611
What's wrong
with the Monopoly man?

15:40.613 --> 15:42.144
That motherfucker...

15:42.146 --> 15:44.744
doesn't have
a fucking monocle anymore.

15:44.746 --> 15:46.144
He's always had a monocle.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.713
Exactly, and now it's gone.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.479
<i>It's because...</i>

15:51.746 --> 15:54.877
<i>a lot of people have noticed
these certain things</i>

15:54.879 --> 15:57.612
<i>that is different than it was
a couple years ago.</i>

15:59.013 --> 16:03.113
<i>People think that we entered
a different dimension,</i>

16:04.146 --> 16:07.080
<i>a dimension that looks
so similar to the other one.</i>

16:07.579 --> 16:08.778
<i>So, that we wouldn't notice.</i>

16:10.013 --> 16:11.479
<i>Except for certain little
things that changed.</i>

16:12.678 --> 16:14.013
<i>Okay, it's called
the Mandela Effect, right?</i>

16:15.013 --> 16:16.546
Nelson Mandela.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.579
The biggest one that fucked
people up in the head

16:19.845 --> 16:21.876
is that a lot of people...

16:21.878 --> 16:24.144
remember hearing
about Nelson Mandela

16:24.146 --> 16:26.011
dying in the '80s

16:26.013 --> 16:28.013
- when he was in jail.
- Hey, Mom.

16:28.645 --> 16:32.211
If you look on Google,
Nelson Mandela died in 2013.

16:32.213 --> 16:33.878
Yeah, I'm at the library.

16:34.213 --> 16:35.843
That's fucking fucked.

16:35.845 --> 16:37.745
I'll be home soon.
I got a little delayed.

16:39.146 --> 16:40.080
I'm leaving now.

16:42.712 --> 16:44.579
All right. Bye.

16:48.012 --> 16:49.079
Oh my God.

16:50.012 --> 16:51.079
Let's do, like, a chain.

16:58.611 --> 16:59.945
Camille, grab your stuff.

17:02.712 --> 17:04.979
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Everything okay?

17:05.744 --> 17:07.512
Yeah, I just told her
I was at the library.

17:08.212 --> 17:09.244
What?

17:10.012 --> 17:11.843
So, you just keep, like,
old photos

17:11.845 --> 17:13.010
so like, send to her.

17:13.012 --> 17:14.944
Yeah, you guys don't do that?

17:15.145 --> 17:17.979
- With your parents?
- No. That's different.

17:18.744 --> 17:20.877
It's the same photo
every time too, I don't...

17:22.012 --> 17:24.446
Well, we're all going back
to my place if you wanna come.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.145
I have to go home.
I really can't.

17:30.012 --> 17:31.045
Okay.

17:35.212 --> 17:36.212
Oh, you don't hug?

17:36.745 --> 17:37.712
Not really.

17:38.611 --> 17:39.712
That's okay,
Ruby doesn't either.

17:42.245 --> 17:46.212
Okay. Um, I'll see you guys
another time, then.

17:47.279 --> 17:48.478
Bye.

17:48.745 --> 17:49.611
Bye.

17:50.079 --> 17:50.979
Bye.

18:27.744 --> 18:29.112
<i>Little bitch!</i>

18:33.577 --> 18:34.544
Oh.

18:39.145 --> 18:40.478
Make a wish.

18:44.978 --> 18:46.145
When did you bake this?

18:47.279 --> 18:49.744
Last night
after you went to bed.

18:51.145 --> 18:52.777
And I didn't put any eggs in it.

18:55.279 --> 18:57.179
I thought we can go
shopping together.

18:59.078 --> 19:00.277
I want to get you a gift.

19:00.279 --> 19:02.142
No, you don't have to spend
your money.

19:02.144 --> 19:03.877
I mean it's okay, it's fine.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.877
We can get you
some new clothes.

19:08.144 --> 19:09.777
And I mean...

19:11.279 --> 19:13.577
- Mom, please.
- You're such a beautiful girl.

19:14.144 --> 19:15.877
- If you take...
- Mom, stop!

21:15.710 --> 21:16.776
<i>For a while...</i>

21:17.810 --> 21:19.476
<i>I was feeling really lonely
and...</i>

21:21.609 --> 21:22.810
<i>it's like...</i>

21:23.710 --> 21:26.177
<i>that loneliness
you... you have...</i>

21:27.143 --> 21:31.774
even if you're in a crowded room
with people smiling

21:31.776 --> 21:32.843
and laughing and...

21:34.143 --> 21:36.876
that emptiness,
I was just feeling it

21:37.609 --> 21:38.743
for so long.

21:41.876 --> 21:44.243
But um...
I don't feel it anymore.

22:15.277 --> 22:16.975
Does it taste like
outdoor-grown weed?

22:16.977 --> 22:18.608
Yeah.

22:19.243 --> 22:20.876
- Hey.
- Hey!

22:21.277 --> 22:22.908
- Hey, Lawrence!
- Hey.

22:22.910 --> 22:24.977
- Hey.
- Hey, girls.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.874
- What's up?
- Hey.

22:26.876 --> 22:28.742
- How you doing?
- Hey.

22:29.110 --> 22:30.742
- How's everybody?
- Hi, Dad.

22:31.575 --> 22:32.742
Hey,
what's up, Camille?

22:34.309 --> 22:36.573
All right, who's hungry?

22:36.575 --> 22:37.773
- Me!
- Oh, yes.

22:37.775 --> 22:39.241
- Alright.
- Please make your lasagna.

22:39.243 --> 22:40.208
Lasagna?

22:40.210 --> 22:41.307
- Yes. Please.
- Okay, lasagna?

22:41.309 --> 22:42.540
Any food.

22:42.542 --> 22:44.008
- Any food?
- Just make food.

22:46.942 --> 22:48.640
It sounds like lasagna it is.

22:48.642 --> 22:50.742
- Yeah.
- Lasagna cool with you, Camille?

22:52.009 --> 22:53.077
Yeah, yeah.

22:53.742 --> 22:56.307
Thank you. See you later.

22:56.309 --> 22:58.475
- Thanks, Dad.
- Thank you.

22:59.775 --> 23:01.210
Janay, your dad's so cool.

23:01.709 --> 23:03.274
Like, it smells like mad weed
in here

23:03.276 --> 23:04.707
and he didn't even say anything.

23:04.709 --> 23:07.640
I know. I don't know why
he doesn't say anything.

23:07.642 --> 23:08.974
Does he, like,
buy you everything?

23:08.976 --> 23:10.707
Like, does he, like,
buy you tampons?

23:10.709 --> 23:12.740
Yeah. Yeah, when I ask him to.

23:12.742 --> 23:13.642
That's dope.

23:13.875 --> 23:14.742
That's mad cool.

23:15.775 --> 23:17.007
I just send him a picture
of like what I want

23:17.009 --> 23:18.242
and he's like, "Okay, got it."

23:18.842 --> 23:20.240
- That's a good dad.
- Yeah.

23:20.242 --> 23:21.475
You use tampons?

23:22.009 --> 23:23.009
Yeah, sometimes.

23:23.842 --> 23:24.909
You don't?

23:26.875 --> 23:27.775
Can't they kill you?

23:28.009 --> 23:29.009
- No.
- What?

23:30.042 --> 23:31.306
Like, your leg can fall off
but you won't die.

23:31.308 --> 23:32.773
Where'd you learn that?

23:32.775 --> 23:33.875
Oh my God. No. Ruby.

23:35.076 --> 23:35.974
- I heard about it.
- You won't die from just using

23:35.976 --> 23:38.273
a tampon, otherwise
the whole country

23:38.275 --> 23:39.740
would not use tampons.

23:39.742 --> 23:40.942
Yeah, baby,
don't use tampons...

23:42.542 --> 23:43.807
- The whole world.
- ...you're gonna have a river in your pants. Like,

23:43.809 --> 23:48.040
would you rather be overflowing
with blood or nicely plugged up?

23:48.042 --> 23:50.606
- Exactly.
- I use tampons.

23:50.608 --> 23:52.642
They work for me.
Still have my legs.

23:54.009 --> 23:55.009
For now.

23:57.875 --> 23:59.140
Are you guys
on your period right now.

23:59.142 --> 24:01.206
- Just finished.
- Yeah, I'm about to start.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.873
- 'Bout to get it.
- I have to go

24:02.875 --> 24:05.007
to the gynecologist
and I'm, like, so nervous.

24:05.009 --> 24:06.940
Like I don't know, I feel like
they're just gonna be like,

24:06.942 --> 24:09.140
"Why does it look like that?"
And I'm just like,

24:09.142 --> 24:10.605
- What?
- ..."I don't know."

24:10.607 --> 24:11.873
It is your vagina?

24:11.875 --> 24:14.206
Yes, I just feel like
they're gonna be like...

24:14.208 --> 24:16.940
But they look at pussy all day,
that's their job.

24:16.942 --> 24:18.140
Look, I don't know,
I just feel like

24:18.142 --> 24:22.541
mine is just extra weird
and I'm just like...

24:22.742 --> 24:24.706
I'm just scared.
I'm just oh, my God.

24:24.708 --> 24:27.739
Look, I know you've probably
seen way more vaginas

24:27.741 --> 24:29.739
than I have.
Can you just take a look?

24:29.741 --> 24:31.007
You want me to look
at your vagina?

24:31.009 --> 24:32.507
- Yes. Okay.
- Okay.

24:33.842 --> 24:35.706
- Oh, my...
- Okay.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.976
Y'all ridiculous.

24:37.741 --> 24:40.741
- Is that okay?
- It's perfect.

24:41.874 --> 24:43.009
It's valid.

24:43.874 --> 24:45.741
- Are you sure? Okay.
- You're good. Yes.

24:46.109 --> 24:48.507
Okay,
Janay has a valid vagina.

24:49.009 --> 24:51.139
- Great.
- Good job. Congratulations!

24:51.141 --> 24:53.239
Amazing. Phenomenal.

24:53.241 --> 24:55.741
I had to go
to the gynecologist

24:56.241 --> 24:59.006
- not too long ago myself.
- Word?

24:59.008 --> 25:02.605
I was skating
at this park in Long Island

25:02.607 --> 25:04.607
and I was hitting this set.

25:05.241 --> 25:07.507
But something happened
and the board just...

25:07.774 --> 25:09.774
I just messed up and I ended up

25:10.141 --> 25:11.872
sitting on the board

25:11.874 --> 25:14.639
and it cut me down there.

25:14.641 --> 25:16.138
- You got credit carded?
- Yes.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.206
Oh, my gosh.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.008
I was just pouring blood.

25:19.241 --> 25:20.706
Dude, that's so scary.

25:20.708 --> 25:21.872
That's like
the scariest thing ever.

25:21.874 --> 25:23.138
I've always feared that.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.839
Like you're really tough
for that.

25:24.841 --> 25:25.774
Like, that's crazy.

25:26.774 --> 25:26.808
Everyone thought
it was my period.

25:27.841 --> 25:27.874
- All the boys were like,
- JANAY: Oh, my God.

25:28.941 --> 25:29.739
- ..."Is that your period?"
- Yo, boys are just...

25:29.741 --> 25:32.006
uneducated sometimes.
I'm sorry.

25:32.008 --> 25:34.006
Not all boys, but some boys.
Just...

25:34.008 --> 25:35.541
- ridiculous.
- Yeah.

25:35.941 --> 25:37.140
Wait, do you have a type?

25:37.741 --> 25:40.708
- Type?
- Like, of... of... like,

25:41.140 --> 25:43.006
- of other people.
- Sexual preference?

25:43.008 --> 25:44.207
Sexual cuisine.

25:44.641 --> 25:47.008
Oh, I don't know.
I don't know.

25:47.641 --> 25:48.874
I mean, what's your type?

25:49.641 --> 25:51.739
- The dickhead type, bro.
- Right!

25:51.741 --> 25:53.939
Every boy that Janay
has been with

25:53.941 --> 25:57.008
- has been a fucking asshole.
- Shut the fuck up, no.

25:57.274 --> 25:59.039
- True.
- Smelly-ass boys.

25:59.041 --> 26:00.674
Can you guys shut up? No.

26:01.107 --> 26:02.140
That's not...

26:03.274 --> 26:04.672
No, seriously,
come on. Answer the question.

26:04.674 --> 26:05.975
Like, what's your type?

26:06.708 --> 26:08.706
Why do you guys wanna know?
I don't know, I just...

26:08.708 --> 26:12.107
Dude, it's a simple question,
do you like dick or pussy?

26:12.606 --> 26:14.272
- I like...
- Do you like sucking dick

26:14.274 --> 26:15.639
- or eating pussy?
- Stop.

26:15.641 --> 26:18.074
Okay, I like boys, okay?
I like boys but...

26:18.874 --> 26:20.174
- Yeah...
- I like pussy.

26:21.207 --> 26:22.540
Nice pussy.

26:33.107 --> 26:34.174
Fuck!

27:16.240 --> 27:17.873
Mom, just relax. Chill.

27:23.073 --> 27:25.606
I'm fucking 18. I do shit.

27:25.974 --> 27:27.206
I'm 18 now.

27:33.873 --> 27:35.907
Why? Is your boyfriend here?

27:36.139 --> 27:37.506
I said lower your voice.

27:41.873 --> 27:42.907
You were skating.

28:27.306 --> 28:28.939
<i>Your mom took your board?</i>

28:30.206 --> 28:31.206
Yeah.

28:32.340 --> 28:33.239
- Damn.
- Why'd she take your board?

28:34.139 --> 28:35.371
Yo, come on.
I'm gonna get you a board.

28:35.373 --> 28:36.237
- Man, I've seen some mom shit.
- Really?

28:36.239 --> 28:38.739
- True, yeah. Yo.
- How?

28:39.006 --> 28:40.206
Yo,
one of you guys have a board?

28:41.440 --> 28:41.971
- What happened?
- Do one of you guys have a board?

28:41.973 --> 28:43.737
No, I'm sorry.

28:43.739 --> 28:44.605
Who's is this?

28:46.572 --> 28:48.572
- Who's is this?
- Why are you fucking with my shit?

28:48.772 --> 28:51.737
Can she just have this one?
Her mom was being asshole.

28:51.739 --> 28:54.739
Ah, chill, don't fuck with my shit. Put
that back before I make you do it myself.

28:56.106 --> 28:58.006
- Take your fucking board.
- All right, bye-bye.

28:59.106 --> 29:00.204
Yo!

29:01.772 --> 29:03.839
Yo!
I got an extra board.

29:04.938 --> 29:06.603
- Really?
- Hell, yeah. Hell, yeah.

29:06.605 --> 29:08.003
What? For me?

29:08.005 --> 29:09.271
I got you. Hell, yeah.

29:09.273 --> 29:10.837
I just wanna see you
keep on shredding,

29:10.839 --> 29:11.772
like, honestly.

29:12.806 --> 29:13.938
- Yo, thank you, Charlie.
- No problem.

29:14.139 --> 29:16.139
Hey, here you go. A hug. Great.

29:17.605 --> 29:18.905
Maybe four means love.

29:24.605 --> 29:25.639
My bad.

29:29.005 --> 29:30.839
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, you can juggle?

29:33.739 --> 29:34.772
Is there a third wheel?

29:35.772 --> 29:37.138
Oh, no.

29:40.572 --> 29:42.070
You just gotta hammer it
sometimes.

29:42.072 --> 29:45.203
- Hey! Hey, you guys.
- Yo! Yo!

29:45.205 --> 29:46.472
Alright.

29:48.305 --> 29:49.737
Setting up this board.

29:49.739 --> 29:51.138
Yeah, we just set up a freshy.

29:53.305 --> 29:55.003
Ta-da.
- How did you mess up.

29:55.005 --> 29:55.871
Oh fucker.

29:56.238 --> 29:59.038
- Camille?
- I'm good, thank you.

31:28.770 --> 31:31.538
Um, I got veggie burgers.

31:49.171 --> 31:50.802

- Do you like tomatoes

31:50.804 --> 31:52.735

31:52.737 --> 31:55.604
Yeah, anything. I'm not picky
when it comes to vegetables.

31:56.104 --> 31:59.870
Okay, cool.
So, I'll do all of them.

32:02.704 --> 32:03.870
Is that multiple choice?

32:04.604 --> 32:05.704
Yeah.

32:06.271 --> 32:07.935
I'm so bad
at multiple choice.

32:07.937 --> 32:09.704
I don't know,
I feel bad for you.

32:11.571 --> 32:12.904

Oh.

33:33.603 --> 33:36.470
Oh,
I keep forgetting Charlie.

33:37.237 --> 33:40.068
Because he got mad nicknames
so I forgot which one,

33:40.070 --> 33:41.269
and I was like, "Who dat?"

33:45.703 --> 33:46.903
You guys are dead.

33:49.103 --> 33:50.602
Yo, who's that lady?

33:54.003 --> 33:55.836
Yo, what's that lady doing?

33:59.070 --> 34:00.602
What are you doing
in the park?

34:00.869 --> 34:04.136
Oh, dude. That's her mom, bro.

34:05.003 --> 34:06.103
Oh, shit.

How did she, like, find her?

No, it's too late.

Hey.

36:09.868 --> 36:10.868
Hi.

36:21.269 --> 36:22.668
Is she always like that?

36:24.002 --> 36:25.568
I don't know, I mean...

36:25.969 --> 36:30.568
I've only been living with her
for like five years, so...

36:31.135 --> 36:32.135
Why?

36:33.567 --> 36:34.835
She's whatever. Like...

36:35.269 --> 36:37.735
hard to be around sometimes.

36:39.002 --> 36:42.634
So, when the courts asked
who I wanted to live with,

36:43.235 --> 36:44.467
I chose him.

36:46.135 --> 36:47.069
Damn.

36:48.035 --> 36:50.768
Yeah, once a year,
I was supposed to see her

36:51.269 --> 36:54.935
during Christmas to, you know,
exchange me.

36:55.600 --> 37:00.600
But... every time we would go,
I would just sit in the car

37:00.868 --> 37:03.002
and I'd see her
through the glass,

37:03.835 --> 37:05.102
sitting, waiting for me.

37:06.935 --> 37:08.534
But I just couldn't get out.

37:08.868 --> 37:13.202
I'd... I would just sit there
and...

37:14.102 --> 37:16.598
my dad would have to go in
and be like,

37:16.600 --> 37:18.701
"Oh, Camille doesn't want
to see you."

37:19.834 --> 37:21.235
And so, we'd just leave.

37:23.135 --> 37:24.500
That's a lot.

37:26.002 --> 37:27.834
Yeah, once I turned 11,

37:28.734 --> 37:32.600
I started, like... changing,

37:34.069 --> 37:35.169
physically.

37:36.867 --> 37:38.767
I used to stand
in front of the mirror

37:41.001 --> 37:43.169
and punch myself in the chest

37:44.101 --> 37:47.867
because I didn't...
I didn't want to grow breasts.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.134
It was horrifying 'cause...

37:53.867 --> 37:56.867
I was always, you know,
dressing in boys' clothes and...

37:57.701 --> 38:00.567
playing football,
and hanging out with my dad.

38:02.600 --> 38:06.232
And when I noticed that
I wasn't going to be like that

38:06.234 --> 38:09.068
forever and that
I was growing up,

38:10.767 --> 38:13.034
it was super embarrassing
because he didn't...

38:14.268 --> 38:16.968
he didn't notice,
he didn't understand.

38:18.068 --> 38:19.168
Uh...

38:22.701 --> 38:25.466
So, one year, that year, I...

38:25.767 --> 38:28.232
on Christmas, I decided, like,
I needed to see her.

38:28.234 --> 38:29.734
I needed to go.

38:30.734 --> 38:32.734
It's not even like I wanted to.
I needed a mother.

38:34.301 --> 38:36.134
But I went and...

38:37.268 --> 38:40.499
I just started spending
more time with her.

38:42.867 --> 38:46.134
Eventually,
after a couple of weeks,

38:46.968 --> 38:50.932
I felt like maybe
I should stay with her,

38:50.934 --> 38:52.466
start living there and...

38:56.700 --> 38:59.733
Uh, my dad was just
super jealous.

39:00.268 --> 39:02.733
He didn't think that...

39:04.001 --> 39:05.001
I'd ever...

39:06.234 --> 39:07.101
leave him.

39:08.001 --> 39:09.466
And I wasn't trying
to leave him but...

39:11.001 --> 39:12.766
I didn't wanna leave him,
I just...

39:16.001 --> 39:17.101
He just wasn't...

39:18.599 --> 39:20.968
Now we don't talk anymore
and...

39:21.934 --> 39:23.265
and I feel so bad

39:23.267 --> 39:25.864
because I didn't want him
to feel like

39:25.866 --> 39:27.866
I didn't want him anymore.
It's just I...

39:28.300 --> 39:30.466
needed a mom at that time,
and, like...

39:32.633 --> 39:36.132
I totally understand.
Like I... I totally understand

39:36.134 --> 39:37.232
what you're going through
and it sucks

39:37.234 --> 39:40.000
and I don't want you
to beat yourself up about it.

40:01.000 --> 40:01.967
Yo, come on.

40:03.167 --> 40:04.733
We have to get to LES before
all the assholes get there.

40:12.266 --> 40:13.833
Skate or die, bitch.

40:14.599 --> 40:15.733
What the fuck?

40:17.599 --> 40:18.733
Yo, we out to the back.

40:45.133 --> 40:47.864
Yo, back the fuck off, son!

40:47.866 --> 40:49.297
How about you teach
your little girlfriend here

40:49.299 --> 40:51.131
how to actually fucking skate
and not look cute

40:51.133 --> 40:52.000
like everybody else.

40:53.033 --> 40:53.596
- Yo, dawg, hey, hey.
- Yo, you wish

40:53.598 --> 40:55.098
a girl this beautiful.

40:57.266 --> 40:59.264
Yeah, right, that's not
what your mom said last night

40:59.266 --> 41:00.465
when I fucked her!

41:01.433 --> 41:02.864
What the fuck?
What the fuck did you just say?

41:15.133 --> 41:16.166
Fucking bitch!

41:17.399 --> 41:21.065
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Don't touch my board, bitch!

41:21.067 --> 41:22.933
- Fuck them, fuck them.
- Give me that shit!

41:24.732 --> 41:26.598
Get off my fucking skateboard!

41:27.732 --> 41:29.765
Get off my fucking skateboard!

41:30.266 --> 41:32.067
Get off my fucking skateboard!

41:34.732 --> 41:36.000
Give me my fucking skate...

41:50.266 --> 41:52.997
So, then you're gonna press this
to void a purchase

41:52.999 --> 41:54.964
but then you're gonna need
a manager to swipe.

41:54.966 --> 41:56.865
And people are gonna be all up
in your face

41:57.099 --> 41:58.997
talking about coupons
but if they're expired,

41:58.999 --> 42:00.765
they're expired, okay?
That's just policy.

42:01.165 --> 42:02.131
Okay.

42:02.565 --> 42:03.832
Like, people get crazy.

42:05.098 --> 42:07.932
- About coupons?
- People get violent.

42:09.266 --> 42:10.999
You wanna take that
to the stockroom for me?

42:11.699 --> 42:13.763
Oh, yeah. Where is it at?

42:13.765 --> 42:16.832
Right there. It says "stockroom"
right there. <i>Andale.</i>

42:23.565 --> 42:26.165
Lana said to bring this
to the stockroom.

42:29.598 --> 42:30.999
Yeah, you can just leave it
right there.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.196
Yo, where's your...
where's your posse at?

42:37.198 --> 42:38.732
Don't you guys travel
in a squad?

42:39.732 --> 42:40.598
Huh?

42:42.131 --> 42:43.999
Your rowdy-ass girl crew,
where they at?

42:45.832 --> 42:46.865
Very funny.

42:50.564 --> 42:52.098
Oh, I hate this job.

42:55.865 --> 42:56.932
- What's up?
- Hi.

42:57.832 --> 42:59.966
Dude, that dickhead
works here too?

43:00.999 --> 43:04.564
Yeah, um, why do you guys
hate him so much?

43:04.865 --> 43:06.198
He's just an asshole, bro.

43:12.597 --> 43:14.098
That one looked perfect,
guys!

43:16.966 --> 43:18.065
Camille, where you at?

43:19.098 --> 43:21.464
Camille hiding. Y'all ready?

43:21.999 --> 43:23.863
Everybody in this?
Oh, you blocking people.

43:23.865 --> 43:25.196
What the fuck is your face?

43:26.764 --> 43:28.930
What the fuck?

43:28.932 --> 43:30.497
The train is coming!

43:32.298 --> 43:34.966
Oh yes.

43:38.131 --> 43:41.595
How did I wake up with scratches
on my body and you wake up

43:41.597 --> 43:43.263
with scratches on your body
in your bed

43:43.265 --> 43:45.562
when I told you the night before
"Take me home.

43:45.564 --> 43:47.131
I'm not feeling good.
Take me home."

43:47.931 --> 43:51.729
And he's just like, "Nah!
It's just you were into it."

43:51.731 --> 43:53.229
And I was like, "No.
It looks like I tried

43:53.231 --> 43:55.729
to fuck you up, which means
something is wrong."

43:55.731 --> 43:58.062
- And like, everybody's...
- They always play it like

43:58.064 --> 44:00.829
it's the girl who's bugging out
but it's not true.

44:00.831 --> 44:02.729
He's calling me crazy
and I know...

44:02.731 --> 44:04.062
- Yeah.
- ...I'm not bugging.

44:04.064 --> 44:05.731
That's so fucked up, bro.

44:06.130 --> 44:08.829
Everybody always just believes
what the boy says.

44:08.831 --> 44:10.229
And then
they'll call you crazy

44:10.231 --> 44:11.862
and you get upset
because you know

44:11.864 --> 44:13.128
- you're not wilding out.
- Yeah.

44:13.130 --> 44:15.995
And it makes you feel
even like you are crazy.

44:15.997 --> 44:17.162
What's that...
what's that shit called?

44:17.164 --> 44:18.729
- Yeah, gaslighting.
- Gaslighting.

44:18.731 --> 44:20.128
- I fucking hate that.
- Recently,

44:20.130 --> 44:21.595
I was with some guy
and we were over

44:21.597 --> 44:22.764
by McCarren chilling
and earlier in the day

44:24.164 --> 44:25.629
everything was fine but one time
we were just chilling on the bench

44:25.631 --> 44:27.130
and he starts putting my hand on his
dick right there. And I was like,

44:28.230 --> 44:29.197
"What the fuck are you doing?"
It was suss as fuck.

44:30.531 --> 44:31.430
- He took your hand and put it on his dick?
- Yeah.

44:31.432 --> 44:34.230
Gross.
That's so fucked up, bro.

44:34.698 --> 44:36.597
Nah, I'ma start doing
that shit though.

44:36.864 --> 44:37.997
- To boys?
- Just like...

44:39.097 --> 44:40.262
Yeah, just bring their hand
right here and be like,

44:40.264 --> 44:41.731
"Yo, daddy, what's up?"

44:41.964 --> 44:43.631
- Word.
- Just, like, feminism.

44:43.997 --> 44:46.764
Yeah, word.
Yo, fuck them, bro.

44:49.064 --> 44:50.731
Looks valid up there.

44:50.931 --> 44:53.230
- You guys ready?
- Yeah, yo.

44:53.631 --> 44:54.731
No, we're not ready.

44:55.831 --> 44:56.731
- We're not ready?
- Camille's not ready.

44:58.631 --> 45:01.561
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Do this.
- Yeah.

45:01.563 --> 45:02.864
Give her the old razzle dazzle.

45:03.698 --> 45:05.262
Come on, let's go!

45:05.264 --> 45:06.496
As long as it doesn't change me.

45:07.596 --> 45:08.197
Nah, for real, like,

You guys,
if you were to smoke

47:39.729 --> 47:42.129
with any famous person
that died, who would it be?

47:43.595 --> 47:45.694
I mean, he's not dead
but I would smoke

47:45.696 --> 47:46.861
with my homey Kevin Bradley.

47:48.263 --> 47:51.063
Off the bat, I'd just rather
smoke with my friends.

47:52.129 --> 47:54.593
Nah, I would...
I would wanna smoke

47:54.595 --> 47:55.926
with Michael Jackson.

47:55.928 --> 47:57.094
Michael Jackson?
That's a good one.

47:57.096 --> 47:58.096
You think he was a stoner?

47:59.263 --> 48:00.527
- Yo, imagine.
- Yeah, he definitely smoked.

48:00.529 --> 48:02.028
- He was a stoner.
- He definitely smoked.

48:02.962 --> 48:04.595
You can't be that wild
and not smoke bud.

48:05.095 --> 48:06.095
He's so cool.

48:07.296 --> 48:08.328
This guy told me that
Jimi Hendrix used to put...

48:08.330 --> 48:12.227
cut slits in his forehead
and put tabs of acid

48:12.229 --> 48:15.694
in his slits and hide it
under his bandana, yes.

48:15.696 --> 48:16.960
- What do you mean...
- Put tabs of acid,

48:16.962 --> 48:18.128
- yeah, like
- ..."cut slits"?

48:19.629 --> 48:20.993
And then he would just
trip balls

48:20.995 --> 48:22.928
- while he was playing.
- He'd be all talking bleeding.

48:23.228 --> 48:25.160
No, just little slits.
Just little ones.

48:25.162 --> 48:26.627
- That sucks.
- Ah, scary.

48:26.629 --> 48:27.728
You did acid before?

48:28.795 --> 48:29.726
- With Jimi Hendrix.
- No, you didn't.

48:29.728 --> 48:30.627
I was kidding

48:30.629 --> 48:31.995
- but I felt like...
- Poor Jimi

48:33.295 --> 48:36.193
I was like, "I feel his soul,"
I was deadass tripping balls.

48:36.195 --> 48:37.293
Like, it was lit.

48:37.295 --> 48:38.993
What flavor is this?
Tastes nice.

48:38.995 --> 48:40.060
- It's weed flavor.
- Taste like...

48:40.062 --> 48:42.026
- It's weed flavor, yeah!
- No, no.

48:42.028 --> 48:43.759
I would say grape.
Probably like, black widow.

48:43.761 --> 48:44.859
Tastes like banana.

48:44.861 --> 48:46.160
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

48:46.162 --> 48:47.128
No.
It actually tastes like...

48:48.095 --> 48:48.761
- Grape?
- Michael fucking...

48:49.728 --> 48:50.461
- Bob Marley?
- Paul Newman

48:51.295 --> 48:52.293
You guys know
who Paul Newman is?

48:52.295 --> 48:52.826
- Snoop Dogg.
- Paul Newman?

48:52.828 --> 48:54.193
Yo fuck it.

48:54.195 --> 48:56.461
Snoop Dogg! Fuck, yeah!

48:57.128 --> 48:58.128
SpongeBob.

49:00.128 --> 49:02.926
You can't light
a spliff under the sea.

49:02.928 --> 49:05.095
It's water,
you can't even light it.

49:05.595 --> 49:08.193
No, no, you know that episode
where they go above the water?

where's your boy posse at?

50:51.227 --> 50:52.627
We ain't stuck like glue
or nothing.

50:54.627 --> 50:55.561
Okay.

50:58.561 --> 51:01.927
Yo, I seen you at the park
the other day shredding.

51:02.994 --> 51:03.994
You were killing it.

51:05.593 --> 51:06.660
Thanks.

51:19.559 --> 51:22.860
Hey, um...
what's your favorite color?

51:24.194 --> 51:25.094
Red.

51:29.860 --> 51:31.127
Is that why you turned
your hair red?

51:34.592 --> 51:35.559
Yeah.

51:36.592 --> 51:37.493
Nice.

51:39.726 --> 51:41.959
See, I like yellow
but if I tried to turn

51:41.961 --> 51:43.992
my hair yellow,
it would just look blonde

51:43.994 --> 51:47.460
and I don't... I don't think,
I don't know...

51:48.626 --> 51:50.493
blonde wouldn't be cool.

51:51.194 --> 51:53.493
A good look but yeah.

51:56.759 --> 51:58.859
But yeah, I'm gonna go inside.
Good-bye.

52:16.261 --> 52:17.926
Fuck it,
that shit was wild.

52:22.261 --> 52:23.590
Imagine if somebody
just came

52:23.592 --> 52:24.826
and wall-rided this shit.

52:45.993 --> 52:47.759
I've been planning this
for weeks!

52:48.859 --> 52:50.757
Come on, don't slack on me
like this.

52:50.759 --> 52:52.559
Yo, let me call you back.
Yo, Camille!

52:53.093 --> 52:54.126
Yo, Camille!

52:55.926 --> 52:58.757
All right, so, I was supposed
to do this photography shoot

52:58.759 --> 53:00.126
with my homey
but he slacked on me.

53:00.559 --> 53:02.624
Are you trying to pull up?
'Cause I really wanna get this.

53:02.626 --> 53:03.526
Me?

53:04.126 --> 53:05.491
Thirty minutes tops.

53:08.193 --> 53:12.060
Well, no, I... I would
but I can't tonight.

53:13.193 --> 53:14.859
Maybe another time.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.458
I'm so down for another time.

53:18.759 --> 53:19.693
Okay?

53:21.625 --> 53:22.558
All right.

53:25.726 --> 53:27.060
- All right, next time.
- Sorry.

55:12.858 --> 55:15.059
I think it'd be cool
if I... I stood on the board.

55:16.192 --> 55:17.092
Huh?

55:17.825 --> 55:18.925
I'm gonna try to skate up here.

55:19.992 --> 55:21.090
Yo, you wilding.

55:21.092 --> 55:22.590
Ready?
I'm gonna do a trick.

55:25.858 --> 55:27.590
- Are you a deadass?
- I'm gonna ollie.

55:28.092 --> 55:29.092
Hold on.

55:30.758 --> 55:31.959
All right, go ahead.

55:33.992 --> 55:35.125
Holy shit.

55:36.758 --> 55:37.992
Let me get a couple more.

55:38.557 --> 55:39.590
That was a little sketchy.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.590
I'ma try to kick flip it.

55:47.858 --> 55:48.892
All right, go.

55:52.992 --> 55:54.159
Does it look good?

55:54.892 --> 55:56.524
Wait, wait. I can go higher.

56:38.724 --> 56:42.557
<i>So, you just come up here
on roofs, look down at people?</i>

56:45.191 --> 56:46.223
<i>Sometimes.</i>

56:51.290 --> 56:52.991
<i>Everything looks
so different.</i>

57:06.124 --> 57:07.958
You know, you're the only girl
I've ever brought up here.

57:10.257 --> 57:11.191
Really?

57:17.590 --> 57:18.456
Yeah.

57:21.058 --> 57:22.991
But you're cool.

57:36.623 --> 57:38.855
<i>Yeah, all right,
yeah. I don't know.</i>

57:38.857 --> 57:40.688
<i>It's, like, is it a thing
where you pop first</i>

57:40.690 --> 57:41.924
<i>and then flick,
or is it one motion?</i>

57:43.257 --> 57:44.989
<i>Yeah, you have to pop.
I don't know, it depends.</i>

57:44.991 --> 57:46.056
I think about it...
I think about it

57:46.058 --> 57:49.556
I was like, as I pop,
I'm flicking and turning.

57:50.124 --> 57:53.056
I think of it as doing a 180
and then like,

57:53.058 --> 57:55.288
just adding the flick in there,
you know?

57:55.290 --> 57:56.855
<i>See, but you do
that whole thing</i>

57:56.857 --> 57:58.587
- <i>where like...</i>
- <i>I just pivot.</i>

57:58.589 --> 58:00.587
Yeah, you do, like...
I feel like you make it

58:00.589 --> 58:01.589
a two-part thing.

58:02.690 --> 58:03.690
Yeah.

58:05.556 --> 58:07.989
Yo, check this trick out
that I learned the other day

58:07.991 --> 58:10.589
- from my friend.
- So funny.

58:17.257 --> 58:19.921
Stop it! Don't do this.

58:19.923 --> 58:22.589
- I know, I know, I know.
- You don't want it!

58:25.990 --> 58:27.556
Hey, look out
that backflip!

58:27.923 --> 58:28.990
Yo, what the fuck is that...

58:31.823 --> 58:34.090
Yo, why you guys snaking us?

58:35.057 --> 58:36.854
Yo, can we even, like,
dead ass skate, bro?

58:36.856 --> 58:38.554
We trying to skate, bro.
We were here first.

58:38.556 --> 58:40.589
No, you're not gonna let
a girl drop in?

58:41.990 --> 58:43.854
What's wrong
with the kiddie pool over there?

58:43.856 --> 58:47.723
What the fuck?
Yo, you guys suck mad dick!

58:48.222 --> 58:50.988
Yo, Kurt, why are you
always talking mad shit?

58:50.990 --> 58:52.120
- Because you're always acting
- Why?

58:52.122 --> 58:53.721
- like a dickhead!
- Get out of here!

58:56.990 --> 58:58.187
Fuck you, son.

59:01.556 --> 59:03.189
Just relax.
Just relax, bro. Just relax.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.821
- Bam. That's it.
- Oh, shit.

59:21.823 --> 59:23.120
Like, if you don't care about
getting...

59:23.122 --> 59:24.854
You just go for it.
I don't know.

59:24.856 --> 59:27.187
I feel like the best like,
a lot of good skaters,

59:27.189 --> 59:28.555
they like do not think.

59:28.856 --> 59:30.854
No that's you can't think,
that's the thing.

59:30.856 --> 59:32.688
And us girls, we think too much.

59:32.690 --> 59:34.187
- I cannot do that.
- Yes, you can.

59:34.189 --> 59:36.189
Like, I could
but I like my life.

59:36.723 --> 59:38.854
Once boys hit puberty,
they just get really good.

59:38.856 --> 59:40.588
I don't know. You notice that?

59:40.923 --> 59:41.923
Eh, no.

59:42.923 --> 59:43.856
I don't pay that much attention
to this shit.

59:44.689 --> 59:45.089
Wow,
is that in Midtown?

59:45.488 --> 59:46.522
Yeah.

59:47.122 --> 59:48.553
I wanna go there.

59:48.555 --> 59:50.756
That's, like
by Bryant Park.

59:50.990 --> 59:52.122
<i>You rolling, bro?</i>

59:52.689 --> 59:54.455
You guys haven't taken me there.
We should go.

59:54.755 --> 59:56.089
I think that might be a little
much.

59:56.957 --> 59:58.023
What do you mean?

59:58.689 --> 01:00:00.087
I mean,
I just don't think

01:00:00.089 --> 01:00:02.555
all of the girls
would wanna do that.

01:00:02.755 --> 01:00:04.122
But you wanna
stand out, right?

01:00:05.222 --> 01:00:07.553
Yeah, I want us all
to stand out, like I wanna...

01:00:07.555 --> 01:00:09.056
So then
we should just go hard.

01:00:09.923 --> 01:00:10.855
It'll be fun.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:27.586
I've seen you do things
way bigger at skate parks.

01:00:27.588 --> 01:00:28.588
I know you can do it.

01:00:29.689 --> 01:00:31.687
It turns into a five-stair
but it's just a four-stair

01:00:31.689 --> 01:00:32.855
at the beginning.
It should be fine.

01:00:35.922 --> 01:00:37.622
- You got it.
- Let's do it.

01:00:40.988 --> 01:00:43.555
- Come on, you got it.
- Nah, I don't know.

01:00:45.555 --> 01:00:47.922
Damn. Damn.

01:00:52.121 --> 01:00:53.455
Come on, you got it.

01:00:54.855 --> 01:00:56.188
Just try it again. Come on.

01:00:56.956 --> 01:00:58.121
All right, firecracker,
let's go.

01:01:11.188 --> 01:01:13.219
- Yeah, Janay!
- Oh, fuck!

01:01:13.221 --> 01:01:14.822
Oh, fuck!

01:01:19.055 --> 01:01:20.720
- What's hurting?
- Fucking ankles.

01:01:20.722 --> 01:01:21.855
Are you okay?

01:01:25.255 --> 01:01:26.487
Just take
a deep breath.

01:01:31.155 --> 01:01:32.121
Just breathe.

01:01:34.955 --> 01:01:36.119
Do you need help?

01:01:36.121 --> 01:01:38.253
No, no. It's okay.
I got it.

01:01:44.755 --> 01:01:45.855
Who is that?

01:01:46.689 --> 01:01:47.986
Oh, my God.
Don't even worry

01:01:47.988 --> 01:01:49.554
about your mom right now.
She's...

01:01:58.587 --> 01:02:00.253
You're gonna be valid
in a couple of weeks

01:02:00.255 --> 01:02:03.086
and we'll be skating
and you'll think back

01:02:03.088 --> 01:02:04.988
to this day
and it'll just be a thing

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.188
that happened.

01:02:08.221 --> 01:02:09.487
I guess.

01:02:11.587 --> 01:02:12.487
What's wrong?

01:02:15.955 --> 01:02:17.621
Sprains take a couple of weeks.

01:02:18.121 --> 01:02:22.119
Really and before you know it,
we'll be skating

01:02:22.121 --> 01:02:24.188
<i>and going to LES and back it.</i>

01:02:25.587 --> 01:02:28.221
<i>It's gonna go by fast.
Just stay up.</i>

01:02:29.587 --> 01:02:30.621
Come on!

01:02:32.554 --> 01:02:33.721
Come on.

01:02:40.721 --> 01:02:42.087
You sure?
It'll make you feel better.

01:02:43.288 --> 01:02:44.654
I got this from Kurt.

01:02:45.521 --> 01:02:46.754
Don't tell her I took it.

01:02:49.987 --> 01:02:50.987
Come on.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:53.087
<i>Let's watch some TV
or something.</i>

01:02:57.821 --> 01:03:00.252
Put your foot, like...
put it like closer to here.

01:03:00.254 --> 01:03:01.719
I don't wanna step
on your fingers.

01:03:01.721 --> 01:03:03.587
- It's okay.
- Okay. Like that?

01:03:04.087 --> 01:03:08.087
Yeah. And then like try and like
just go as like fast as you can

01:03:08.688 --> 01:03:10.120
and just shove it onto the left.

01:03:10.621 --> 01:03:11.721
Try and go fast.

01:03:14.254 --> 01:03:16.454
That was pretty close.
You just have to go faster.

01:03:36.254 --> 01:03:37.486
Yo, what's up?

01:03:38.721 --> 01:03:39.754
You girls want a bev?

01:03:39.987 --> 01:03:41.252
- I'm good.
- Good.

01:03:41.254 --> 01:03:43.686
Get me, like, Fiji water,
nice snacks.

01:03:43.688 --> 01:03:44.752
- Hmm.
- Alright. Cool.

01:03:44.754 --> 01:03:45.721
All that.

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.054
So...

01:03:48.954 --> 01:03:50.054
Hi, Camille.

01:03:50.954 --> 01:03:51.954
How are you guys?

01:03:53.987 --> 01:03:55.020
What do you mean?

01:03:55.987 --> 01:03:57.952
You know,
how are you guys doing?

01:03:57.954 --> 01:03:58.985
Patrick?

01:03:58.987 --> 01:04:00.553
Yeah, you like him, don't you?

01:04:01.586 --> 01:04:03.054
I like how he gives me head.

01:04:04.853 --> 01:04:06.751
All right, so, then like
when do you know...

01:04:06.753 --> 01:04:07.853
How do you know
you like them?

01:04:09.254 --> 01:04:10.620
What do you mean?

01:04:10.987 --> 01:04:13.120
How do you know
if you like a guy?

01:04:13.586 --> 01:04:15.087
You just know.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.220
You get a feeling.

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.120
It happens.

01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:21.553
How do you know
when they like you?

01:04:22.852 --> 01:04:25.586
Why are you asking me
so many questions?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:27.751
You like someone.

01:04:27.753 --> 01:04:28.985
No, I don't.

01:04:28.987 --> 01:04:29.987
Who do you like?

01:04:30.919 --> 01:04:32.453
- What's his name?
- I don't like anyone.

01:04:33.553 --> 01:04:34.750
- You like someone.
- No, I... no I don't.

01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:37.486
I'm being really serious.
Even though I'm smiling I swear.

01:04:38.852 --> 01:04:39.984
Whatever.

01:04:39.986 --> 01:04:40.986
But Janay and that dude

01:04:42.053 --> 01:04:43.752
what's up with them?
Like, the dude at the party.

01:04:43.986 --> 01:04:45.917
Are they togeth...
Are they, like a thing?

01:04:45.919 --> 01:04:47.620
They were, like
all over each other.

01:04:48.053 --> 01:04:50.152
Nah, he didn't mean anything
to her.

01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:51.720
Not like Devon did.

01:04:52.852 --> 01:04:54.553
Devon. How?

01:04:55.019 --> 01:04:56.586
- They were...
- They had a thing,

01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:58.852
like on and off for years.

01:04:59.852 --> 01:05:01.720
And she just...
she can't get over it.

01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:03.852
He's a dick.

01:05:05.586 --> 01:05:07.086
- Damn.
- Yeah.

01:05:07.752 --> 01:05:09.453
He's an asshole.
I wish she would.

01:05:09.819 --> 01:05:11.119
But it's whatever.

01:05:11.986 --> 01:05:14.986
Your fucking foot
looks like my tie-dye, bro.

01:05:16.086 --> 01:05:17.053
That's crazy.

01:05:18.387 --> 01:05:18.986
- I know.
- That's a sign that it's healing though.

01:05:20.353 --> 01:05:20.986
- It's the same color as her board, yo.
- Yeah, really?

01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:22.752
Are you icing it?

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:25.917
Um, kind of like
you're not supposed to ice it

01:05:25.919 --> 01:05:27.687
for too long but like yeah,
I've been icing it.

01:05:27.886 --> 01:05:29.117
- That's good.
- Yeah.

01:05:29.119 --> 01:05:30.284
So what else
have you been doing?

01:05:30.286 --> 01:05:32.685
- Just chilling this.
- Yo.

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:34.184
Yo,
what the fuck is that?

01:05:34.186 --> 01:05:36.984
This is Tony Alva.
He's my animal therapy rat.

01:05:36.986 --> 01:05:38.053
Why is he here?

01:05:39.586 --> 01:05:40.517
- Because he's supposed to help you.
- No can you please...

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:40.553
- No, please. No, please.
- He's chill.

01:05:42.053 --> 01:05:43.951
- He's supposed to help you.
- I really don't like rats. Please!

01:05:43.953 --> 01:05:44.817
- You're scared of him?
- Yes!

01:05:44.819 --> 01:05:46.420
- He's smaller than you.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.953 --> 01:05:49.583
He's really cool.
You would like him if...

01:05:49.585 --> 01:05:50.686
And what the fuck?
He's like shitting

01:05:51.819 --> 01:05:52.784
- on the floor. Can you get...
- He's just an animal.

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:53.619
He's just an animal.
He's supposed to shit.

01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:58.284
All right, Kurt,
let's just bring Tony

01:05:58.286 --> 01:06:00.652
somewhere else. All right?

01:06:00.852 --> 01:06:01.886
Yeah.

01:06:02.219 --> 01:06:03.452
Bye, Janay.

01:06:03.718 --> 01:06:05.619
- You sure?
- No, no, no.

01:06:07.253 --> 01:06:08.485
Stop!

01:06:09.519 --> 01:06:10.053
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Come on, Kurt.

01:06:28.953 --> 01:06:30.685
I tried to link you.
You get my text?

01:06:31.286 --> 01:06:33.718
Yeah, sorry I didn't get back.
I was...

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:35.053
No issues.

01:06:36.286 --> 01:06:38.550
I'm about to go sack some clips
with the boys up at Midtown.

01:06:38.552 --> 01:06:39.585
You trying to pull up?

01:06:41.119 --> 01:06:44.452
Hmm. Yeah, I'm down.

01:06:51.952 --> 01:06:53.583
- Yo, what up?
- There you are, bro.

01:06:53.585 --> 01:06:55.585
- What's good, bro?
- Hey, yo, Dev, who's this?

01:06:56.751 --> 01:06:57.918
- It's Camille.
- Hi.

01:06:59.118 --> 01:06:59.816
- She gonna bomb with us today.
- Are you serious?

01:06:59.818 --> 01:07:02.219
Yeah, bro. She fucking shreds.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:05.452
'Aight, yo, make sure
that chica's keep up, though.

01:07:05.818 --> 01:07:07.085
- Yeah.
- Deadass, bro.

01:07:07.286 --> 01:07:08.818
Are we skating
or we talking?

01:07:15.585 --> 01:07:16.818
Oh, shit.

01:07:17.818 --> 01:07:18.718
Yo!

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.185
Yo, yo, yo,
let's hit some bangers on this.

01:07:23.285 --> 01:07:24.985
Let's go!
Let's get these clips!

01:07:27.618 --> 01:07:28.552
Yeah.

01:07:30.952 --> 01:07:32.085
Oh, yeah!

01:07:33.118 --> 01:07:35.718
Yo, stop right now!
Break it up!

01:07:39.918 --> 01:07:42.584
- Y'all gotta get out of here.
- All right, all right.

01:07:42.985 --> 01:07:44.582
Just this last one guys.
Just get that.

01:07:44.584 --> 01:07:45.718
Get that right quick.

01:07:46.785 --> 01:07:50.716
- Did you just...
- Yo. Yo! Yo, yo, yo!

01:08:00.018 --> 01:08:01.550
- Hey, back off.
- Sir, sir.

01:08:02.118 --> 01:08:04.952
I let him borrow my board.
That's my board.

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:09.581
Can I just please have
the board back?

01:08:09.583 --> 01:08:10.985
I didn't know we weren't allowed
to skate here.

01:08:12.484 --> 01:08:13.983
- Hey, come on, you know this is private property.
- No, I didn't.

01:08:13.985 --> 01:08:14.916
- Listen.
- I really didn't. And he was just using my board...

01:08:14.918 --> 01:08:17.250
- This is our job, all right?
- Alright.

01:08:17.252 --> 01:08:19.116
I totally understand that
but can I just please have

01:08:19.118 --> 01:08:20.849
the board back?
I'm not trying to fight you

01:08:20.850 --> 01:08:22.715
or... or be disrespectful
like them.

01:08:22.716 --> 01:08:25.283
I'm just trying to get
the board back. Please?

01:08:25.285 --> 01:08:26.984
Take this board, right?

01:08:28.085 --> 01:08:29.118
Come on.

01:08:30.185 --> 01:08:31.051
- I just let him borrow it.
- Take the board...

01:08:32.185 --> 01:08:33.581
And get the fuck
from around here.

01:08:33.582 --> 01:08:34.814
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:08:34.817 --> 01:08:36.218
Don't let me catch you
out here again, okay?

01:08:36.617 --> 01:08:37.850

Wait,
what videos did you see?

01:10:42.217 --> 01:10:44.182
I watched, like,
every single video you posted.

01:10:44.184 --> 01:10:45.716
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

01:10:58.084 --> 01:10:59.683
- What's up?
- Hey, what's up?

01:11:02.683 --> 01:11:03.649
Nothing.

01:11:04.582 --> 01:11:06.182
What's up
with your home girl Janay?

01:11:06.184 --> 01:11:07.816
I haven't seen her shred
in a minute.

01:11:09.116 --> 01:11:12.582
Yeah, no, she actually fell
super hard the other day

01:11:12.783 --> 01:11:14.081
and sprained her ankle.

01:11:14.083 --> 01:11:16.616
No way. Is she gonna be okay?

01:11:17.251 --> 01:11:18.516
Yeah, she's good.

01:11:18.716 --> 01:11:20.116
She just rolled her ankle
really bad.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:23.983
So, she's just been kind
of like house-locked.

01:11:24.683 --> 01:11:25.749
- Ah.
- Yeah.

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:28.849
Sucks.

01:11:31.716 --> 01:11:33.016
<i>So, what have you
been doing all day?</i>

01:11:33.250 --> 01:11:34.183
<i>This.</i>

01:11:35.283 --> 01:11:37.116
<i>Come on,
don't look like that.</i>

01:11:38.116 --> 01:11:40.582
<i>Cheer up. It's summer.</i>

01:11:41.216 --> 01:11:42.849
<i>Yeah,
and I'm in the house.</i>

01:11:44.582 --> 01:11:45.716
I like how it pointed
this way...

01:11:47.749 --> 01:11:52.183
I'm gonna head out to the park,
so I'll see you, okay?

01:11:53.549 --> 01:11:54.582
All right.

01:12:19.615 --> 01:12:21.715
So, what happened with you
and her?

01:12:23.548 --> 01:12:25.579
She couldn't handle us
being just friends,

01:12:25.581 --> 01:12:27.581
so I had to cut it off.

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.116
Ah.

01:12:31.715 --> 01:12:32.748
We still cool.

01:12:35.250 --> 01:12:36.615
- Hi, ladies.
- Hi.

01:12:37.983 --> 01:12:40.548
Janay, let me see this ankle.

01:12:44.983 --> 01:12:46.150
The swelling's down.

01:12:46.748 --> 01:12:47.682
See?

01:12:48.682 --> 01:12:50.949
- Still purple.
- Progress. Progress.

01:12:51.848 --> 01:12:52.748
Chin up.

01:12:53.982 --> 01:12:55.116
<i>Get out the way, pigeon!</i>

01:13:07.615 --> 01:13:10.682
Oh, shit.
Yo, that was mad close.

01:13:13.949 --> 01:13:15.181
Yo, bro,

01:13:15.183 --> 01:13:16.848
I'm about to fuck this girl,
bro.

01:13:17.115 --> 01:13:19.615
Oh, my God,
she's so fucking fine, bro.

01:13:19.915 --> 01:13:22.813
Like, bro, her ass is like round
as shit.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:23.880
Yeah, you a thot,
that's what.

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:26.980
I'm not a thot, bro.
I'm just... I'm a man

01:13:26.982 --> 01:13:30.546
who likes women, bro.
I love beautiful, smart women.

01:13:30.548 --> 01:13:31.782
<i>I love beautiful, smart women.</i>

01:13:33.049 --> 01:13:35.846
They be nice to be around. Curly
hair, big lips, thick as fuck.

01:13:35.848 --> 01:13:37.082
My God, man.

01:13:37.581 --> 01:13:38.947
They're just dope.

01:13:38.949 --> 01:13:40.713
I'm trying to not listen,
but I hear it.

01:13:40.715 --> 01:13:43.080
Like, she invited me
to her own crib.

01:13:43.082 --> 01:13:46.180
I didn't even have to invite her
to my apartment, dude.

01:13:46.182 --> 01:13:49.182
Like I was just like, "Wow."

01:13:50.115 --> 01:13:51.848
She gave me some buns!

01:13:52.182 --> 01:13:53.982
Oh, really?
Some hot dog buns.

01:13:56.581 --> 01:13:57.982
It was like God's vagina.

01:13:58.815 --> 01:14:00.279
Dude.
Did you just say "God's vagina"?

01:14:00.281 --> 01:14:01.880
That's where we...
That's where we...

01:14:01.882 --> 01:14:02.848
So, God's a girl, right?

01:14:03.915 --> 01:14:04.813
- Come on.
- God is a girl.

01:14:04.815 --> 01:14:05.848
- Oh, yeah.
- God's definitely a girl.

01:14:06.682 --> 01:14:07.915
She was fine!
I can't stop.

01:14:08.547 --> 01:14:09.547
I can't get over it, bro.

01:14:10.682 --> 01:14:11.578
- I can't get enough of the girl.
- What's her name?

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.614
Her name is Tez.

01:14:13.181 --> 01:14:14.713
She's valid.

01:14:14.715 --> 01:14:16.480
- Where's she from?
- I don't know.

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:20.848
<i>I just met the girl,
she was dancing on me,</i>

01:14:21.181 --> 01:14:22.715
<i>then I fell in love, dude.</i>

01:14:24.848 --> 01:14:26.279
- Me first?
- You gotta land it first.

01:14:26.281 --> 01:14:27.782
Oh, okay, cool.

01:14:31.547 --> 01:14:32.982
Oh, back you up!
I got you!

01:14:36.915 --> 01:14:40.115
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if I can't skate anymore.

01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:42.679
Like, that's my whole life.

01:14:42.681 --> 01:14:44.246
Like, you know that,
that's all I do.

01:14:44.248 --> 01:14:45.445
Come on, you're...
you're gonna be able

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:48.845
to skate soon and, Janay,
skating isn't your whole life.

01:14:48.847 --> 01:14:51.914
You're still you with
or without your board, okay?

01:14:53.248 --> 01:14:55.712
Why do you sound
like Devon? Oh, my God.

01:14:55.714 --> 01:14:57.845
He used to say, like, deep shit
like that, like,

01:14:57.847 --> 01:14:59.747
all spiritual and stuff
and I'm just like...

01:15:01.547 --> 01:15:03.214
It's not... it's not you.
It's just like...

01:15:03.814 --> 01:15:05.181
he really messed me up.

01:15:15.248 --> 01:15:16.480
Yeah!

01:15:21.248 --> 01:15:22.214
Nice.

01:15:25.948 --> 01:15:27.048
Hit that shit.

01:15:31.247 --> 01:15:33.981
You just gotta, like put your
foot out more and catch it, you know?

01:15:34.547 --> 01:15:36.981
Like, here, watch.
Watch my front foot.

01:15:38.213 --> 01:15:40.447
Oh, my God.

01:15:42.113 --> 01:15:43.612
Watch your front foot.

01:15:43.614 --> 01:15:45.178
I hit a rock.
That doesn't count.

01:15:45.180 --> 01:15:46.614
Ow.

01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:53.812
More towards
the beginning, like...

01:15:53.814 --> 01:15:54.948
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

01:15:56.113 --> 01:15:58.745
- Your homegirl's over there and she is faded.
- What?

01:15:58.747 --> 01:16:00.614
She needs some help.
Well, yeah, she's flattened out.

01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:03.446
Yo, Eliza, Eliza. Hey.

01:16:05.513 --> 01:16:06.981
What the fuck did you do
to her?

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.714
We was just trying to get lit.

01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:10.914
- That's it.
- Devon, what the fuck?

01:16:11.747 --> 01:16:13.113
She's obviously
not good.

01:16:14.479 --> 01:16:15.879
- Nah, nah, nah. No one's trying to violate.
- Go away.

01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:17.446
- Go away, Juan. Go away.
- Dude, I thought it was some...

01:16:18.546 --> 01:16:19.345
No, I don't care.

01:16:19.347 --> 01:16:20.247
- Devon!
- Yo, bro, bro,

01:16:20.981 --> 01:16:22.278
- let's just clear.
- All right, whatever.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.577
- Leave.
- Whatever.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.446
Thank you.

01:16:24.814 --> 01:16:26.113
I told her
it was on some next-level shit.

01:16:26.814 --> 01:16:28.211
She can't handle it,
so whatever.

01:16:28.213 --> 01:16:30.544
Yo, your friends can be real
assholes sometimes,

01:16:30.546 --> 01:16:31.781
you know that, right?

01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.180
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:16:46.713 --> 01:16:48.180
What's going on
with you and Devon?

01:16:48.981 --> 01:16:50.178
No, not now.

01:16:50.180 --> 01:16:51.811
- Are you fucking him?
- No, God!

01:16:51.813 --> 01:16:54.577
We work at the same place.
That's all.

01:16:54.579 --> 01:16:56.780
- Does Janay know?
- No, she doesn't, but...

01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:00.178
Why haven't you told her?
You need to tell her.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.678
<i>You need to tell her.</i>

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:03.113
<i>I will, I will.
Come on.</i>

01:17:50.179 --> 01:17:52.579
Oh, my God,
you should see that clip, bro.

01:17:54.079 --> 01:17:55.979
- Janay!
- Hi.

01:17:57.846 --> 01:17:59.446
- We missed you.
- Hi, Janay.

01:18:00.846 --> 01:18:02.680
Hey, Janay. You're alive!

01:18:02.913 --> 01:18:05.210
- I know!
- And walking and outside!

01:18:05.212 --> 01:18:06.944
Hi. Ew, you're sweaty.

01:18:06.946 --> 01:18:08.411
- Come, let's skate, let's skate, let's skate.
- We're out here workin' hard.

01:18:08.413 --> 01:18:10.613
- Get on the board. Get on the board.
- Please don't kill me.

01:18:11.012 --> 01:18:12.277
No,
you have to lean that way.

01:18:12.279 --> 01:18:13.212
Yeah.

01:18:16.713 --> 01:18:17.946
Watch out for the side!

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:19.846
Oh, my gosh!

01:18:20.713 --> 01:18:22.212
Oh! Ah, shit.

01:18:23.046 --> 01:18:25.846
Oh, no! Oh!

01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:29.046
- Are you okay?
- Indigo, what did you do?

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:30.846
I'm only trying to kill her
a little bit.

01:18:33.079 --> 01:18:34.712
I don't wanna do this
anymore.

01:18:34.946 --> 01:18:35.846
Okay.

01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:37.445
Well, I'll still roll you back.

01:18:41.046 --> 01:18:43.745
She was just good again
and you fucked her up again.

01:18:44.112 --> 01:18:46.810
You know, butt-ass naked
running around SoHo

01:18:46.812 --> 01:18:49.578
'cause I ain't have
no fucking clothes.

01:18:49.946 --> 01:18:51.880
- So, we had to call somebody.
- Mm.

01:18:52.112 --> 01:18:53.977
But we didn't have phones,
right.

01:18:53.979 --> 01:18:56.743
So, we had to be on the computer
like, Facebook

01:18:56.745 --> 01:18:59.710
messaging people to come get us
and open the door and shit,

01:18:59.712 --> 01:19:01.077
- like...
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:19:01.079 --> 01:19:03.112
- What? What's wrong?
- What the fuck?

01:19:03.812 --> 01:19:05.712
- Hello.
- What happened?

01:19:05.979 --> 01:19:08.179
Janay! Janay!

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.445
Janay!

01:19:11.945 --> 01:19:13.812
- Janay, what happened?
- Camille!

01:19:15.046 --> 01:19:16.812
- What's up?
- What the fuck is this?

01:19:17.246 --> 01:19:18.810
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:19:18.812 --> 01:19:20.277
This is you staying late
at work?

01:19:20.279 --> 01:19:21.679
Janay, I... no,
I was going...

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:23.612
I'm over here waiting for you
to text me back and shit

01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:25.510
and you're fucking around
with Devon?

01:19:25.512 --> 01:19:26.443
- Are you kidding me?
- I was gonna tell you.

01:19:26.445 --> 01:19:28.076
- I just, like...
- But you didn't!

01:19:28.078 --> 01:19:29.478
I wanted to tell you.

01:19:30.745 --> 01:19:32.943
You didn't tell me shit!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:19:32.945 --> 01:19:33.911
Indigo knew.

01:19:34.845 --> 01:19:35.943
Don't be bringing me
into your bullshit.

01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:38.842
It was not like that, Janay.
It was not how she said.

01:19:38.844 --> 01:19:40.976
- I told her no.
- So, I'm the only idiot here, right?

01:19:40.978 --> 01:19:42.243
- Janay.
- I'm guessing you knew, too.

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:44.109
- Listen.
- Bitch, I didn't know shit!

01:19:44.111 --> 01:19:45.842
She kept this shit to herself,
bro.

01:19:45.844 --> 01:19:47.677
She did this by herself,
on the low.

01:19:47.679 --> 01:19:48.712
Janay,
you were all depressed.

01:19:50.512 --> 01:19:51.510
- Don't fucking touch me!
- You were all depressed in your bed, like, I didn't know...

01:19:51.512 --> 01:19:53.578
- how to tell you and...
- That's not an excuse.

01:19:53.779 --> 01:19:55.243
I don't want...
what is wrong with you?

01:19:55.245 --> 01:19:56.712
Why would you do that?

01:19:57.512 --> 01:19:58.743
You're supposed to be my friend!

01:19:58.745 --> 01:19:59.745
I am your friend.

01:20:00.878 --> 01:20:01.876
No, friends don't go fuck
their friend's boyfriends!

01:20:01.878 --> 01:20:03.976
I didn't fuck him.
We were just taking photos

01:20:03.978 --> 01:20:05.677
and skating
and that's all we did.

01:20:05.679 --> 01:20:07.045
So, you're skating with him
now too?

01:20:08.645 --> 01:20:10.143
- Of all the boys you could've fucking chose...
- You fucked up.

01:20:10.145 --> 01:20:12.710
- ...you chose him?
- I'm trying so hard to like not punch you

01:20:12.712 --> 01:20:13.842
in your face right now.

01:20:13.844 --> 01:20:15.109
Why were you skating with them?

01:20:15.111 --> 01:20:17.679
Why not? I'm just skating!
Like...

01:20:18.111 --> 01:20:20.109
- you don't own me.
- It's not just skating!

01:20:20.111 --> 01:20:22.943
- What is it then?
- You fucking tell me! You were with him!

01:20:22.945 --> 01:20:25.243
- It was just skating and I'm telling you.
- Were you sucking his dick

01:20:25.245 --> 01:20:27.176
- while you were on the roof with him or some shit?
- Are you fucking

01:20:27.178 --> 01:20:28.045
kidding me? No.

01:20:29.577 --> 01:20:31.109
Alright, if you want to skate with
whoever the fuck you want to skate with,

01:20:31.111 --> 01:20:33.276
- then get the fuck out of here!
- You're such a fucking shitty friend.

01:20:33.278 --> 01:20:34.909
- Fuck you guys.
- Just leave. Just go.

01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:35.909
Don't fucking touch me.

01:20:35.911 --> 01:20:37.976
Shut the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

01:20:37.978 --> 01:20:39.976
- How could you fucking touch me.
- Chill, chill.

01:20:39.978 --> 01:20:41.777
- Indigo. Go. Go.
- Fucking touch me!

01:20:41.779 --> 01:20:43.276
Yo, yo, yo, yo.

01:20:43.278 --> 01:20:44.577
You wanna...
you wanna fight?

01:20:46.045 --> 01:20:47.276
- No, get the fuck out of here.
- That's all you can do, right?

01:20:47.278 --> 01:20:48.211
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Leave bitch.

01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:50.078
- Whatever.
- You fucking whore.

01:20:53.211 --> 01:20:54.577
Your mother's a whore!

01:20:57.245 --> 01:21:01.178
Your mom is fucking dirty,
you dumb bitch.

01:21:11.045 --> 01:21:12.111
Fuck you.

01:21:24.245 --> 01:21:25.544
Fucking God.

01:22:20.611 --> 01:22:22.577
- Deadass.
- You got this!

01:22:23.044 --> 01:22:24.708
Yo, what's going on?

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:26.175
Is it cool if Camille chills
for a bit?

01:22:26.177 --> 01:22:28.175
- Yeah, it's fine. She can chill over there.
- Alright.

01:22:28.177 --> 01:22:29.476
You can chill right here.

01:22:30.843 --> 01:22:33.610
This kid, I don't even know this kid.

01:22:33.843 --> 01:22:36.110
- Yo all gonna have to wake up.
- We got a nice crib!

01:22:36.576 --> 01:22:37.810
We pay rent and all that.

01:22:42.710 --> 01:22:44.476
Camille how are you doing?

01:22:45.543 --> 01:22:47.942
Next time you come, make sure
you bring your mom with you,

01:22:47.944 --> 01:22:49.910
all right? I'm a MILF-er.
I'm a MILF-er.

01:22:52.709 --> 01:22:54.242
Nah
but I've fucked a MILF before.

01:22:54.244 --> 01:22:57.476
Nah! Nah! Nah, yeah,
that shit is crazy.

01:22:57.944 --> 01:23:00.175
Nah, I'm deadass.
So, you know I be chilling

01:23:00.177 --> 01:23:01.944
at the bar right over
around the corner.

01:23:02.210 --> 01:23:03.975
So, I was chilling
around the corner, right?

01:23:03.977 --> 01:23:04.977
Real facts.

01:23:06.044 --> 01:23:07.809
I been chilling,

01:23:08.977 --> 01:23:11.742
- She's like, you know, 25.
- That's not a MILF.

01:23:12.110 --> 01:23:13.742
Nah, this... nah. Yeah, nah.

01:23:14.110 --> 01:23:16.809
Swear on... I swear on anything.

01:23:17.110 --> 01:23:18.210
I swear on anything.

01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:20.707
All right,

01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:24.275
- All right, let him rock.
- Tell us, tell us.

01:23:24.277 --> 01:23:27.275
All right, so, I'm chilling at the bar
and this chick just comes up to me.

01:23:27.277 --> 01:23:28.941
She's like,
"Can I buy you a drink?"

01:23:28.943 --> 01:23:31.807
And she's wasted.
And I'm just like, "All right."

01:23:31.809 --> 01:23:33.709
She buys me the drink,
we're chilling.

01:23:33.976 --> 01:23:36.175
She's, like...
she goes in to just kiss me,

01:23:36.177 --> 01:23:38.242
right like I've been talking
to this chick

01:23:38.244 --> 01:23:40.208
for like two minutes.
I kid you not.

01:23:40.210 --> 01:23:41.709
She buys me a drink,
I'm drinking the drink.

01:23:41.909 --> 01:23:43.640
She turns around,
she tries to kiss me.

01:23:43.642 --> 01:23:45.074
I'm like, yo,
I don't know who she is,

01:23:45.076 --> 01:23:46.976

01:23:47.676 --> 01:23:49.974
And then she... she was like "Oh you...
And she was like

01:23:49.976 --> 01:23:52.209
"Are you gay?"
And I was like... "What?"

01:23:52.609 --> 01:23:54.840
She was like...
I forgot how it went but like

01:23:54.842 --> 01:23:56.541
- somehow she was like...
- You had it!

01:23:56.543 --> 01:23:58.807
No, okay. No, no, no, no!

01:23:58.809 --> 01:24:00.740

01:24:09.276 --> 01:24:11.074
Yo, she was like,
sugar mama type.

01:24:11.076 --> 01:24:13.274
I would pull up to the crib.

01:24:13.276 --> 01:24:15.776
- You're, like, 15, nigga.
- She was 38...

01:24:16.109 --> 01:24:20.176
she was 38 and she had two kids
and she treated me right, bro.

01:24:22.209 --> 01:24:23.609
All I need
is once chance.

01:24:24.876 --> 01:24:25.440
- Baby oil everywhere.
- All I need is one night.

01:24:27.509 --> 01:24:29.840

01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:16.741
- That shit is killing it.
- That's totally fire.

01:25:17.908 --> 01:25:19.574
All right, skate video.

01:25:19.841 --> 01:25:21.209
Relax.

01:25:21.708 --> 01:25:23.041
- Yeah.
- Skate video time.

01:25:23.043 --> 01:25:24.109
Yo. Oh, I gotta...

01:25:25.442 --> 01:25:26.975
- Can't even read my <i>Thrasher.</i>
- Yo, I need the bud.

01:25:32.076 --> 01:25:33.042
Welcome.

01:25:34.574 --> 01:25:35.574
Oh.

01:25:45.841 --> 01:25:46.841
You read this?

01:25:47.708 --> 01:25:48.841
Yeah.

01:25:50.841 --> 01:25:52.075
My mom loves him.

01:25:54.108 --> 01:25:55.042
Yeah?

01:25:55.276 --> 01:25:56.708
Yeah, when I was younger,

01:25:57.075 --> 01:26:00.273
she got me a copy,
but it's in Spanish.

01:26:00.275 --> 01:26:02.474
It's easy to be crazy
about love in Spanish.

01:26:03.975 --> 01:26:05.608
You can leave your shit,
like, under there.

01:26:06.108 --> 01:26:07.075
Probably safer.

01:26:11.574 --> 01:26:12.975
We got a bed for you
in the living room.

01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:14.108
Okay.

01:26:17.841 --> 01:26:19.474
<i>And the female
is so resourceful,</i>

01:26:19.741 --> 01:26:21.240
<i>as she sits there,
she plucks down</i>

01:26:21.242 --> 01:26:24.440
<i>from her own breast
to create this big blanket.</i>

01:26:25.108 --> 01:26:26.806
<i>When she leaves,
she'll sometimes</i>

01:26:26.808 --> 01:26:29.574
<i>pull this blanket back over the
eggs to keep them warm.</i>

01:26:30.708 --> 01:26:33.538
<i>From the outside, it looks a
lot like a teenager's bedroom,</i>

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:35.839
<i>but if you were to cut it down
the middle</i>

01:26:35.841 --> 01:26:36.942
<i>and take a look inside,</i>

01:26:38.309 --> 01:26:41.706
<i>whether made by paws or beaks,
these homes were built...</i>

01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:43.173
Go to your room.
Go to your room.

01:26:44.573 --> 01:26:45.675
Shut up, grandpa.
Go to sleep.

01:26:46.808 --> 01:26:48.273
Yeah, that way. Oh!
Right there on her belly?

01:26:48.275 --> 01:26:49.607
So, put me
onto the other one.

01:26:50.741 --> 01:26:50.775
- No, man.
- Put me onto the other one.

01:26:51.908 --> 01:26:52.538
- So, stop chatting.
- Stop changing it.

01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:53.540
Nah, you chatting.

01:26:55.075 --> 01:26:56.006
- You said you fucked the other one.
- You... You chatting

01:26:56.008 --> 01:26:56.705
- and you changing it.
- Nah, nah.

01:26:56.707 --> 01:26:57.605
I put in the skate video.

01:26:57.607 --> 01:26:59.705
- Yo!
- That shit's fire.

01:26:59.707 --> 01:27:01.573
- Yo!
- Roll something up.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.471
- Yeah, shut up and roll something, man.
- Aw, come on.

01:27:03.473 --> 01:27:07.638
- Bro, you gotta stop with the porn.
- I'm gonna break this shit.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.540
Yo!

01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:10.571
- Bro.
- Yo, stop changing it.

01:27:10.573 --> 01:27:11.973
Nah, nah,
let's finish the skate video.

01:27:11.975 --> 01:27:12.942
- Yo!
- Bro.

01:27:14.042 --> 01:27:14.975
- Yo, you making me ash all over!
- It's four.

01:27:16.573 --> 01:27:17.638
- You gonna break my phone, you fucking bitch!
- No, I'm tired of this shit.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.805
No. Trying to see my nigga...

01:27:20.807 --> 01:27:22.607
That just can't be the event.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.605
- Bro!
- She got two melons.

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:26.972
She never told me
she was wearing gloves!

01:27:26.974 --> 01:27:28.208
Oh, my God!

01:27:28.974 --> 01:27:31.573
Yo!

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.805
- Got that?
- Yo, that was OG hard.

01:27:47.807 --> 01:27:49.807
- See if we can get a little higher, but...
- Check that.

01:27:52.041 --> 01:27:53.007
What?

01:27:58.275 --> 01:27:59.905
Yo, don't trip off that shit,
all right?

01:27:59.907 --> 01:28:02.440
We're on the zone,
all right? Now kickflip this.

01:28:04.207 --> 01:28:05.473
I need a minute.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:05.807
Excuse me?

01:31:17.272 --> 01:31:18.205
Yo.

01:31:19.239 --> 01:31:20.172
Oh.

01:31:21.538 --> 01:31:22.638
What's up? What you doing?

01:31:23.073 --> 01:31:25.106
Yeah, they were just being loud
out there.

01:31:26.705 --> 01:31:28.971
So, I thought I would come
in here.

01:31:28.973 --> 01:31:30.838
- Shit, for real?
- Yeah.

01:31:32.239 --> 01:31:33.438
Tim, stop.

01:31:48.239 --> 01:31:49.438
You good?

01:31:50.705 --> 01:31:53.005
Yeah.

01:31:53.838 --> 01:31:55.705
Yeah, I'm just so fucked up.

01:31:57.705 --> 01:31:58.571
The Henny.

01:32:05.239 --> 01:32:06.571
It's so hot in here.

01:32:09.705 --> 01:32:10.738
Yeah, it's just...

01:32:21.939 --> 01:32:23.705
- What's up?
- Nothing.

01:33:34.570 --> 01:33:35.405
What's wrong?

01:33:39.938 --> 01:33:42.704
I like you so much, Camille...

01:33:44.271 --> 01:33:46.204
just... just not like this.

01:33:47.537 --> 01:33:49.071
- Not like what? What are you...
- It's...

01:33:50.704 --> 01:33:53.936
It's like you're... you're like
a little sister to me, you know?

01:33:53.938 --> 01:33:54.971
It's like you're one of us.

01:33:56.104 --> 01:33:57.437
- And I don't wanna...
- Really?

01:33:57.837 --> 01:33:58.904
Really?

01:33:59.238 --> 01:34:00.369
I mean, am I wilding right now?

01:34:00.371 --> 01:34:03.070
I mean, I just figure
we have a different type of...

01:34:03.938 --> 01:34:06.835
You know, I thought... I thought
we got along so well and...

01:34:06.837 --> 01:34:08.236
No, like, 100%.

01:34:08.238 --> 01:34:10.437
But, like,
I just don't wanna mess that up.

01:34:12.170 --> 01:34:14.037
Okay. Okay.

01:34:14.871 --> 01:34:16.101
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:34:16.103 --> 01:34:17.737
I'm so...
I'm sorry if I'm like...

01:34:18.170 --> 01:34:20.170
- No, I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. I just...

01:36:52.835 --> 01:36:53.770
Camille?

01:38:25.535 --> 01:38:26.602
I messed up.

01:38:39.834 --> 01:38:40.734
Okay.

01:38:44.568 --> 01:38:45.568
You wanna try?

01:38:49.834 --> 01:38:50.834

01:38:52.101 --> 01:38:53.199
Don't... right here.

01:38:53.201 --> 01:38:54.199

- Okay.

01:38:54.201 --> 01:38:56.434
- Use your other foot.
- Okay.
