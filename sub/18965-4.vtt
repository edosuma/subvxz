10:44.644 --> 10:46.687
Oh, um, Robert saw a bear
at school today.

10:46.687 --> 10:48.982
He scared him off,

10:48.982 --> 10:50.733
but it had Laura worried,
so I walked her home.

Mm-hmm.
That's Hank Rivera.

goes to school with Laura.

right through here.

Someone needs to do something
to stop them.

a decision yet.

Lee said it himself. He said,
"Now the real work starts."

I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see him again.

12:20.198 --> 12:21.782
Well, that's not true.

12:21.782 --> 12:24.327
