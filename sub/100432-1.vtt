00:17.018 --> 00:20.185
(creatures groaning)

00:23.124 --> 00:25.657
(intense music)

00:27.795 --> 00:30.696
(people shouting)

00:45.146 --> 00:48.047
- [Hobnail] Gods be
damned, I hate this forest.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.049
- [DJ] I'm just glad the
rain's finally letting up.

00:50.051 --> 00:51.350
- [Marko] That won't last.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.818
- [Top] Cut the chatter.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.053
How's our rear?

00:54.055 --> 00:54.904
- [Whisper] No sign.

00:54.905 --> 00:55.754
Think they may have pulled back.

00:55.756 --> 00:57.322
- [Top] DJ, how's home?

00:57.324 --> 00:59.425
- [DJ] Seems clear, bring it in.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.726
- Keep an eye out for leeches.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.662
(intense music)

01:34.228 --> 01:36.762
Hob, how long until the
inside perimeter is secure?

01:36.764 --> 01:38.130
- Keep interrupting me

01:38.132 --> 01:42.234
and you're looking at a big, fat
never.

01:42.236 --> 01:44.736
- How about I slit the little
toad down the middle, Top?

01:44.738 --> 01:46.805
- How about I punch an arrow
straight

01:46.807 --> 01:48.307
through your pretty little neck?

01:48.309 --> 01:49.341
- Leave Hob alone, Whisper.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.542
You know she can't help it.

01:50.543 --> 01:51.742
She's just huffed too
many of her own potions.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.645
- Play nice, soldiers.

01:53.647 --> 01:54.880
- Got a stray, north grove.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.618
(creature groans)

01:59.620 --> 02:01.487
Kaylee said you shoot like you
screw.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.188
I guess she wasn't lying.

02:03.190 --> 02:05.007
- What does that even mean?!

02:05.008 --> 02:06.825
- It means you can never find
the target.

02:07.795 --> 02:08.827
You know.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.362
- Oh, come on!

02:10.363 --> 02:11.896
That's low, look, I
didn't ask for this job!

02:11.899 --> 02:13.499
- [Top] You got the job
because Switch isn't

02:13.501 --> 02:14.433
here and I told you to do it.

02:14.435 --> 02:15.834
So pipe down and kill shit.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.639
Dammit, where the hell are our
people?

02:20.641 --> 02:22.341
- Manoj nakoshtos!

02:22.343 --> 02:24.276
Done.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.210
The perimeter is secure with
shriekers.

02:26.213 --> 02:27.813
You're welcome.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.114
- [Top] Good job.

02:29.115 --> 02:30.414
- Quit smacking your torc,

02:30.417 --> 02:33.552
or you'll break the enchantment
again.

02:33.554 --> 02:34.887
- Who's gonna secure
the outside perimeter?

02:34.889 --> 02:36.389
- You volunteering?

02:36.390 --> 02:37.890
Let's see you take your new
trophy shield

02:37.892 --> 02:39.424
up to Ghostwatch new guy.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.559
- I'm not new.

02:40.561 --> 02:41.527
- It's covered.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.195
- Covered, right!

02:43.197 --> 02:44.830
Judge got back today.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.867
Huzzah.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.903
I hope we all survive the
reunion with that tree-hugging

02:50.905 --> 02:52.371
psycho--
- Hobnail,

02:52.372 --> 02:53.838
my friend, you better
quit while you're ahead.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.607
- And while you still have a
head.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.179
- Whisper.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.920
(fire blaring)

03:07.922 --> 03:08.754
I see them.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.689
200 paces out.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.246
They got Slab!

03:12.247 --> 03:13.802
Seven hells, he does not look
good.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.358
- Keep them covered until they
get inside,

03:15.362 --> 03:16.628
then post to Ghostwatch.

03:16.630 --> 03:17.963
- I've only got so many arrows.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.082
- Then pick better targets.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.200
Whisper, DJ, Marko,
secure the second floor.

03:22.203 --> 03:25.370
(suspenseful music)

03:31.712 --> 03:34.213
(Top groans)

03:46.827 --> 03:49.795
(man groaning softly)

03:49.797 --> 03:51.830
- [Buttercup] Mission
accom, accomplished, Top.

03:51.832 --> 03:52.931
- Good job, all of you.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.499
Where's Wymrick?

03:55.803 --> 03:56.935
(Top gasps)

03:56.937 --> 03:59.938
(ominous music)

04:08.682 --> 04:10.415
- [Buttercup] They almost
got Kaylee, too, but we--

04:10.417 --> 04:12.651
- We traded one life for
another.

04:15.256 --> 04:19.258
- Wymrick the Red will be
missed,

04:19.260 --> 04:20.926
and as soon as we get home,

04:20.928 --> 04:22.427
we will give him a proper send
off.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.329
Until then, there is work to do.

04:24.331 --> 04:25.764
It's good to have you back,
Slab.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.332
Now let's get you fixed up.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.002
- Those mother-humping Nosck
gutterdogs--

04:30.004 --> 04:31.837
- [Buttercup] Cut him
open with mordine-barbs.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.822
- I've tried every spell I know,

04:33.823 --> 04:35.806
and every elixir in my bag,
but he won't stop bleeding!

04:35.809 --> 04:36.942
- It's the damned venom.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.910
- Maybe Hobnail can--
- No!

04:38.912 --> 04:41.913
You keep that gods-forsaken
abomination away from me.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.316
(suspenseful music)

04:44.318 --> 04:46.685
- [Top] I need you healed
up as soon as possible.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.103
Use this.

04:48.104 --> 04:49.520
It'll stop both the
venom and the bleeding.

04:49.523 --> 04:50.689
- I'll die before I let you
touch me

04:50.691 --> 04:52.324
with any of Hob's potions.

04:52.326 --> 04:53.358
- [Flewellyn] That's
not one of her's, son.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.660
- [Top] It works.

04:54.661 --> 04:55.961
- That stuff's not meant for our
kind.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.363
We can't use it.

04:57.364 --> 04:58.764
- [Switch] It works until it
doesn't.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.000
- It hasn't begun to quicken
yet.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.568
- Hey, guys.

05:03.570 --> 05:06.938
(Kaylee grunts)

05:06.940 --> 05:07.906
I don't feel so good.

05:07.907 --> 05:08.873
- Better ask that
goddess of yours for some

05:08.874 --> 05:09.840
actual help, Kaylee.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.743
- Top, don't make me do this.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.679
- [Top] Use it, Kaylee.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.747
Then clean the wound before it
quickens.

05:17.051 --> 05:18.583
- It's okay.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.484
I can handle it.

05:20.921 --> 05:21.820
He goes first.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.958
(Kaylee groans)

05:26.960 --> 05:29.561
(Slab groans)

05:48.415 --> 05:51.483
(suspenseful music)

05:53.654 --> 05:54.486
(Top gasps)

05:54.488 --> 05:57.422
(muscle sizzles)

05:57.424 --> 05:59.925
(Top whimpers)

06:11.705 --> 06:13.839
- Fix him, that's an order.

06:13.841 --> 06:16.641
(Kaylee panting)

06:16.643 --> 06:19.611
Flewellyn, move Slab to the
Chopshop.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.481
Switch, Buttercup, to your
posts.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.618
(suspenseful music)

06:30.557 --> 06:31.923
- See anything?

06:31.925 --> 06:32.991
- No.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.493
Wait, I do see something.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.562
It's your missing spine.

06:38.565 --> 06:41.233
(Marko snickers)

06:41.234 --> 06:43.902
- It was the Samada soldier
hiding behind that bush, not me.

06:43.904 --> 06:45.537
I just went to finish him off.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.840
That's called protecting your
flank.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.008
- Really?

06:50.010 --> 06:51.710
And did you kill him?

06:51.712 --> 06:53.578
Because I don't remember
seeing you draw your weapon.

06:53.580 --> 06:56.481
- He was already bleeding
to death when I got there.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.817
There's nothing for me to do.

06:58.819 --> 07:02.020
Thanks to all the arrows
you guys put into him.

07:02.022 --> 07:05.457
That's called overkill, by the
way.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.992
I mean, the Samada are tough and
all,

07:06.994 --> 07:11.797
but you freakin' archers are
just way too enthusiastic.

07:11.799 --> 07:13.632
- What color are the feathers?

07:13.634 --> 07:18.703
- (grunts) One blue, one orange.

07:19.573 --> 07:20.705
- And the third?

07:20.707 --> 07:22.641
The killing arrow?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.743
- Wouldn't you like to know?

07:24.745 --> 07:27.045
(snickers)

07:30.984 --> 07:33.685
- This one wasn't caused by
mordine-barbs.

07:33.687 --> 07:36.621
But, the venom's in your
body so won't stop bleeding.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.657
What did it?

07:38.659 --> 07:40.025
Ice blade or a Vine sword?

07:40.027 --> 07:41.193
- [Slab] What difference does it
matter?

07:41.195 --> 07:42.878
Just get on with it!

07:42.879 --> 07:44.562
- Well, smart guy, if I
treat an ice blade wound

07:44.565 --> 07:46.598
with this blood sap, it'll
quicken straight away,

07:46.600 --> 07:48.767
lighting you up from the
inside, and then lighting up

07:48.769 --> 07:51.002
this barn and then lighting
up the entire forest.

07:51.004 --> 07:51.903
- Bullshit!

07:51.905 --> 07:53.972
There's not enough of it in
there.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.708
It'll light me up, definitely.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.243
You, maybe.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.212
Him, hopefully.

08:00.214 --> 08:03.014
- (laughing) I forgive you,
Slab,

08:03.016 --> 08:05.150
because you're probably gonna
die.

08:05.152 --> 08:06.852
But you should know that
arguing with a child

08:06.854 --> 08:09.087
is a dangerous and ill-advised
endeavor.

08:09.089 --> 08:10.622
- Call me child again,
Flewellyn,

08:10.624 --> 08:12.757
and I'll make you eat a torch.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.259
- Now, Kaylee, you know what Top
says

08:14.261 --> 08:16.661
about starting a fire you can't
put out.

08:16.663 --> 08:17.863
- Fuck!
- No, no!

08:17.865 --> 08:19.398
Don't waste!
- I don't care if I burn up,

08:19.399 --> 08:20.932
just get him to shut up already!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.868
(panting)

08:22.869 --> 08:24.803
- [Flewellyn] Son, don't keep
doing stupid stuff like that.

08:24.805 --> 08:27.739
I'm rather keen on not
visiting the Sword Halls again.

08:27.741 --> 08:28.773
- Again?
(Kaylee scoffs)

08:28.775 --> 08:30.141
- That's for being an idiot.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.143
- [Flewellyn] Do you
want me to hold him down?

08:32.145 --> 08:33.645
- No, just leave.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.985
- She'll be as gentle as always,

08:39.987 --> 08:41.820
but it's still gonna hurt like
hell,

08:41.822 --> 08:43.121
so brace yourself.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.161
(Slab sighs)

08:51.798 --> 08:53.165
- [Kaylee] Looks like you fucked
a hill

08:53.166 --> 08:54.533
full of fire ants there, big
guy.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.168
- You sounds like DJ.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.737
- [Kaylee] Don't insult me.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.241
- God, I really hate this
kingdom.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.686
I am not worried about
the pain, I can handle it.

09:14.688 --> 09:16.154
I just don't want the
others to think that--

09:16.156 --> 09:18.557
- I'll twist a cantrip
to speed the healing.

09:18.559 --> 09:24.796
It's not much but, just
tell me when you're ready.

09:25.766 --> 09:28.633
(Slab screams)

09:33.674 --> 09:36.074
- That Nosck shield Marko
picked up is pretty tough.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.159
- Yeah.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.243
Too bad he's about two feet too
short

09:38.245 --> 09:39.144
to lug it around.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.247
(Slab continues screaming)
- I don't know.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.583
He can block a lot of shit with
it.

09:44.585 --> 09:47.252
- You're bucking for two
straight weeks of latrine duty.

10:01.234 --> 10:03.868
(Slab continues screaming)

10:03.870 --> 10:04.970
- That girl has a mean streak in
her

10:04.972 --> 10:06.204
that rivals Hobnail's.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.673
- Cruelty isn't in her nature.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.041
She just grew up too quickly.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.176
- War does that.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.786
- [DJ] I don't understand them.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.889
- Who, the Nosck, the Samada,

10:24.891 --> 10:26.758
or the weirdos who hired us?

10:26.760 --> 10:28.827
- The Nosck.

10:28.828 --> 10:30.895
Like every day, right
now, right before dawn,

10:30.897 --> 10:31.963
they lineup on the battlefield,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.798
set their weapons and armor
aside,

10:33.800 --> 10:36.134
sit down bare assed naked in the
snow,

10:36.136 --> 10:39.838
and meditate or, I don't
know, pray, or whatever.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.972
- You have way too much free
time

10:40.974 --> 10:42.641
to think about stupid shit.

10:42.643 --> 10:43.775
- That's crazy if you ask me.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.293
- I didn't.

10:45.294 --> 10:46.810
- Remember that recon a few days
ago?

10:46.813 --> 10:48.380
I overheard some Samada soldiers
say

10:48.382 --> 10:51.750
the Nosck have icefire
in their veins, huh?

10:51.752 --> 10:53.785
I bet you that keeps them--
- Shh!

10:53.787 --> 10:54.886
- What is it?

10:54.888 --> 10:57.789
(rain trickling)

10:59.893 --> 11:01.393
What?

11:01.395 --> 11:02.827
(ominous music)
- Look.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.866
- Movement, northeast quad.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.934
Nosck just beyond the perimeter
wards.

11:09.936 --> 11:12.904
(creature grunting)
- Grimhail markings.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.806
If that thing sets off
the wards, we're fucked.

11:14.808 --> 11:15.974
(creature shrieks)
Seven hells, down!

11:18.945 --> 11:21.246
That's one big son of the snow
whore.

11:21.248 --> 11:23.415
It must be a wallbreaker.

11:23.417 --> 11:25.050
- [Top On The Torc] All swords,
dig in.

11:25.052 --> 11:25.950
No torcs.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.853
(creature grunts)

11:34.828 --> 11:37.896
(creatures roaring)

11:47.040 --> 11:48.273
Overwatch, report.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.475
- Top, something isn't right.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.243
That wall breaker was hauling
full kit.

11:52.245 --> 11:55.146
- [DJ] And at least four squads
of berserkers flanked him.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.781
- [Top On The Torc] Scout
reports from Samozar's unit

11:56.783 --> 11:58.817
say the Grimhail are out of
food.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.351
They must be moving east away

12:00.353 --> 12:02.187
from Stone's Fall to forage.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.455
- The villagers don't stand a
chance.

12:03.457 --> 12:04.378
They need our help.

12:04.379 --> 12:05.300
- [Top On The Torc] We stay.

12:05.301 --> 12:06.222
Those are our orders.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.492
- Top, let me go!

12:07.494 --> 12:09.160
I can assassinate the Nosck
IceHand

12:09.162 --> 12:10.545
and the Samada Exarch.

12:10.546 --> 12:11.929
The villagers can escape
in the confusion--

12:11.932 --> 12:13.209
- Contract or not,

12:13.210 --> 12:14.487
we can't just let the
villagers be slaughtered.

12:14.488 --> 12:15.765
- [Top On The Torc]
Conversation over, DJ.

12:15.769 --> 12:17.902
Update Judge on the situation.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.471
- [DJ] Yeah, like Judge
needs advanced warning.

12:19.473 --> 12:21.390
- It's better than nothing.

12:21.391 --> 12:23.308
I almost feel sorry for them
when they run into Judge.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.416
- A copper for your thoughts?

12:31.418 --> 12:32.317
- No, thanks.

12:34.020 --> 12:36.988
- [Buttercup] I'm your team
leader, I can order you to talk.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.762
- I don't get it.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.063
I should be on Overwatch.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.831
I'm the best shot in the unit.

12:46.833 --> 12:52.871
Reaper, she isn't all that
bad, but Whisper, DJ, come on,

12:52.873 --> 12:55.007
it doesn't make sense.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.142
- Use that stupid hayseed
head of yours (scoffs).

12:57.144 --> 13:00.145
Top's got his two best archers,

13:00.147 --> 13:02.881
you and Reaper looking south.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.149
Why?

13:04.151 --> 13:06.451
- He's worried about the
Serrinians?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.887
They don't even have a dog in
this fight.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.422
We wouldn't be needed here if
they did.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.024
Why would he care about
Serrinia?

13:13.026 --> 13:14.826
- Who cares?

13:14.828 --> 13:16.528
Politics are above my pay grade.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.464
All I know is I've got
better things to think about,

13:19.466 --> 13:22.000
like keeping you stupid
peckerwoods alive.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.503
And don't think for a moment
you make it easy for me,

13:25.505 --> 13:27.338
Wymrick worst of all.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.440
There's not a single one
of you I wouldn't toss back

13:29.442 --> 13:32.277
into the pits for another
month or two of training.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.512
Then maybe you wouldn't
die on me so often.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.550
- Wymrick wouldn't have
wanted to go out any other way

13:38.552 --> 13:41.186
and you know it.

13:41.187 --> 13:43.821
- All we do is die in the
name of other peoples' causes.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.890
- [Switch] They pay us well for
it.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.126
- But don't you think we should
have some greater purpose

13:48.128 --> 13:52.063
than chasing the next
score and hoping some

13:52.065 --> 13:54.332
stroke of luck, we survive?

13:54.334 --> 13:56.134
- No.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.336
I like the gold, and when I die,

13:58.338 --> 14:01.172
it goes to my brothers and
sisters just like Wymrick.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.309
If the cause is just, so much
the better.

14:04.311 --> 14:07.478
- How many bodies do
we leave in the ground

14:07.480 --> 14:09.314
when the captain says
the cause is out of money

14:09.316 --> 14:11.282
and it's time to move on?

14:11.284 --> 14:12.150
Is that just?

14:12.152 --> 14:14.419
- I don't know.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.920
Don't care.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.256
(dramatic music)

14:18.258 --> 14:21.059
(rain trickling)

14:35.308 --> 14:37.642
- You know we're done, right?

14:37.644 --> 14:40.144
- You sound like a Doom Herald.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.880
You want a bell to ring in the
streets?

14:41.882 --> 14:44.182
- That scout report
from Popper's crew said

14:44.184 --> 14:46.517
the four Nosck units on
the western border are

14:46.519 --> 14:49.220
preparing for a final
push against the Samada.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.023
- Now three.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.725
The Grimhail.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.426
- Yeah, no shit, new guy, I
heard.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.061
So what?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.230
That still leaves us with the
other three.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.132
- Well, that's good news!

15:01.134 --> 15:02.433
It means we're slightly less
likely to die

15:02.435 --> 15:04.035
when they come to kill us.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.171
- Just switch posts with DJ
already.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.508
You're annoying.
(arrow cracks)

15:10.510 --> 15:13.177
(arrow clangs)

15:13.179 --> 15:15.046
- You need to relax.

15:15.048 --> 15:16.180
- Relax?

15:16.182 --> 15:17.148
Relax?

15:18.418 --> 15:19.550
It's a good thing you're so
pretty,

15:19.552 --> 15:21.519
otherwise I'd puncture your
lungs.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.959
We are so doomed.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.094
- You're acting like Hobnail.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.297
- Haven't you been listening?

15:32.299 --> 15:34.532
Not only are the Nosck camped
west,

15:34.534 --> 15:38.169
we have the entire Sacred March
of the Samada to our east!

15:38.171 --> 15:41.239
That army is as big as all
four Nosck units combined!

15:41.241 --> 15:43.975
Oh, and let's not forget the
Ardenians,

15:43.977 --> 15:46.177
who hired us in the first place.

15:46.179 --> 15:50.114
They can't wait to crucify
us on their Soul Weald.

15:50.116 --> 15:53.351
- To be fair, they should be mad
at us.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.087
The Captain reneged on his
contract.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.589
And someone cut down one of
their sacred Soul Wealds.

15:58.591 --> 16:01.092
- Those trees are creepy.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.394
The woods just feel off, like
off off.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.030
- Yeah I know, it's like a snake
humped

16:06.032 --> 16:07.231
a tree sprite or something.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.636
- We've been in some tight
spots before, Marko, but this?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.638
It's crazy.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.208
- The Captain had his
reasons for what he did.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.142
- So says Top.

16:19.713 --> 16:20.712
- I trust Top.

16:20.714 --> 16:24.449
And if Top says the
Captain had his reasons,

16:24.451 --> 16:26.084
I believe him.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.253
- Our only way out is
through one of those armies.

16:29.255 --> 16:31.422
- Top will get us out of this.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.459
He always does.

16:34.461 --> 16:37.295
- You've only been with
us for two campaigns.

16:37.297 --> 16:40.164
What the seven hells do you
know, you dumb mud-chin?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.171
(Marko sighs)

16:48.541 --> 16:51.442
(creature groans)

16:55.281 --> 16:56.147
- What's goin' on?

16:57.283 --> 16:58.683
- Excuse me?

16:58.685 --> 17:01.219
- You took Cobra team to
Riversmeet this morning

17:01.221 --> 17:03.021
to me with the Captain.

17:03.023 --> 17:06.290
You've been running Vulture
Squad ragged with recon.

17:06.292 --> 17:08.693
And then there was the
mission that killed Wymrick.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.195
What game are you playing?

17:12.499 --> 17:15.166
- You're too damn nosy for
your own good, old man.

17:15.168 --> 17:16.701
- No, my friend,

17:16.703 --> 17:19.203
I've just been at this
longer than you have.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.305
- Speaking of which,

17:22.675 --> 17:24.242
why don't you accept that
promotion

17:24.244 --> 17:26.177
to unit commander and get out of
my hair?

17:26.179 --> 17:27.545
- I don't think my torc
could bear the weight

17:27.547 --> 17:29.347
of another notch.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.549
And you haven't answered my
question.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.351
- You'll find out soon enough.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.786
- Sla--
- The unit's orders

17:34.788 --> 17:38.289
are between myself and
the Captain for now.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.026
- Very well.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.327
- If you don't like it, feel
free to take that promotion.

17:47.167 --> 17:48.066
- May I?

18:01.314 --> 18:04.515
(Slab and Kaylee groan)

18:14.294 --> 18:18.262
- Your magic is weak, girl,

18:18.264 --> 18:23.334
and it stinks of seaweed and
sunlight.

18:23.336 --> 18:26.604
- You're lucky I swore an oath
to Top

18:26.606 --> 18:30.208
or I would smite you dead,
you wretched homunculus.

18:30.210 --> 18:34.278
- Someday, princess,
you're going to need me;

18:34.280 --> 18:39.350
and when that day comes, I'm
going to look the other way.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.286
- (scoffs) If you're all that
stands between me and death,

18:42.288 --> 18:43.788
I'll take death.

18:43.790 --> 18:45.590
- [Slab] Knock it off, both of
you.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.400
- You should feel the
healing cantrip start

18:56.402 --> 18:57.568
to kick in soon.

18:57.570 --> 19:01.472
If more blood appears on
the bandages, send for me.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.473
- [Slab] Yes, ma'am.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.543
- Don't worry.

19:05.545 --> 19:09.780
If he starts to bleed out,
I'll take care of him.

19:33.339 --> 19:35.907
(ominous music)

19:44.250 --> 19:46.851
(Hobnail snarls)

19:48.488 --> 19:50.821
(sniffing)

19:55.295 --> 19:56.227
- What now?

19:56.863 --> 19:58.863
- Do you smell that?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.667
Something foul here.

20:03.937 --> 20:06.370
Something familiar.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.472
- Kaylee?
- No!

20:08.474 --> 20:10.775
That horrible bitch didn't twist
this.

20:10.777 --> 20:12.944
She doesn't know the first thing
about...

20:14.781 --> 20:16.214
This is like--

20:19.485 --> 20:21.819
(bangs on floor)

20:21.821 --> 20:23.171
- [Hobnail] Missed me!

20:23.172 --> 20:24.522
- Stick your head in, let's see!

20:24.524 --> 20:27.825
- [Hobnail] You smell
anything strange up there?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.961
- Just archer farts.

20:29.963 --> 20:31.963
(arrow thuds)

20:31.965 --> 20:34.932
(Hobnail sniffing)

20:39.706 --> 20:42.907
- You got any last words for
him?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.909
Usually you say something
poignant.

20:47.347 --> 20:50.881
- No, not this time.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.883
- [Kaylee] Why not?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.687
- I couldn't protect you.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.322
- It wasn't your fault.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.259
You were nowhere near him and
Slab when...

21:02.028 --> 21:07.298
(Flewellyn blows)
(ominous music)

21:12.605 --> 21:13.938
- Fitting.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.306
- What does it mean?

21:17.277 --> 21:20.044
- It means Wymrick the Red is
not going

21:20.046 --> 21:21.912
to the Sword Halls, child.

21:21.914 --> 21:22.947
- How can that be?

21:22.949 --> 21:25.883
- His sins were far greater than
any of us

21:25.885 --> 21:27.018
could have ever imagined.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.322
You tell no one about this.

21:34.661 --> 21:37.495
(rain trickling)

21:45.305 --> 21:46.904
- Uninvited pest.

21:46.906 --> 21:47.938
Should I kill it?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.440
- What do you want?

21:49.442 --> 21:51.042
- Something's wrong.

21:51.044 --> 21:54.912
It smells all wrong in
here, in the whole barn.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.814
(sniffing)

21:56.816 --> 21:58.683
- Try taking a bath once in a
while.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.497
Is that a new hutch?

22:12.498 --> 22:13.998
I don't recognize the god's
mark.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.533
- Yeah.

22:15.534 --> 22:17.067
The Captain gave it to me a few
weeks ago.

22:17.070 --> 22:18.069
He said it once belonged to a
priest

22:18.071 --> 22:19.103
of the Rage Thane.

22:19.105 --> 22:22.907
Apparently he pissed off the
wrong guy, got himself killed.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.609
(Switch grunts)

22:30.917 --> 22:34.552
- This isn't like the other
campaigns, is it, Flewellyn?

22:38.424 --> 22:39.123
- No.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.127
(sighs)

22:43.129 --> 22:45.096
(war drums beating)

22:45.098 --> 22:47.898
(dramatic music)

22:47.900 --> 22:49.767
- Listen to me!

22:49.769 --> 22:52.703
There is vile magic here
that we haven't seen

22:52.705 --> 22:55.139
in a very long time!

22:55.141 --> 22:56.774
It's here!

22:56.776 --> 22:58.676
I smell it!

22:58.677 --> 23:00.577
- Are you talking about what
I think you're talking about?

23:00.580 --> 23:04.482
- It or one of its minions.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.717
- That was nine years ago.

23:06.719 --> 23:10.654
When you broke the binding
spell on Cerak's phylactery,

23:12.024 --> 23:13.758
the backlash destroyed
everything except us.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.160
- Carried the lich-mark of
Alden.

23:16.162 --> 23:17.828
He could have survived it

23:17.830 --> 23:20.664
or some of his creations
could have survived it

23:20.666 --> 23:23.734
or one of those infernal
artifacts!

23:23.736 --> 23:26.670
- Do you really believe
your spell-breaking

23:26.672 --> 23:27.972
was so half-assed?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.473
- I don't know.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.878
That was the best I ever
twisted, though.

23:33.880 --> 23:35.946
- Whatever you think you smell

23:35.948 --> 23:38.682
is nothing more than a loosened
memory.

23:38.684 --> 23:39.884
Because if anything survived
your magic,

23:39.886 --> 23:41.852
it means you didn't do your job,
soldier,

23:41.854 --> 23:45.089
and I refuse to believe that.

23:45.091 --> 23:49.460
- Let's walk away from
this damn stupid war

23:49.462 --> 23:53.697
and this damn stupid
country while we still can.

23:53.699 --> 23:54.732
Just us.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.667
Vulture and Cobra.

23:58.638 --> 24:00.871
(sniffs)

24:04.177 --> 24:06.143
- I swear to all the
Warlords in the Sword Halls,

24:06.145 --> 24:08.813
that mage is more trouble
than she's worth at times.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.431
- Go easy on her.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.048
She can't help who she is, or
her calling.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.754
- All swords to the Abbey.

24:16.756 --> 24:22.893
DJ, Switch, keep an open eye
for more Grimhail foragers.

24:22.895 --> 24:23.961
You two are it right now.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.197
- Finally!
- Got it!

24:26.966 --> 24:27.865
- Gods!

24:27.867 --> 24:31.802
Why the hell is he always
putting me on arrow duty?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.737
- My guess is he's
trying to get you killed

24:33.739 --> 24:36.173
because you annoy the
shit out of everybody.

24:36.175 --> 24:39.243
(war drums beating)

24:41.180 --> 24:43.814
- Enough with the damn war drums
already!

24:43.816 --> 24:45.716
- Better than Samada trumpets.

24:47.820 --> 24:50.087
(war drums beating)

24:50.089 --> 24:53.924
(Kaylee breathing heavily)

25:08.908 --> 25:10.741
- [Buttercup] Stay frosty, farm
boy.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.911
- What do you think it is?

25:13.913 --> 25:17.081
- [Buttercup] Maybe Top tellin'
us we can go home at last.

25:17.083 --> 25:17.982
- Gods willing.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.720
(war drums beating)

25:33.032 --> 25:35.065
- Yesterday morning the
other unit commanders

25:35.067 --> 25:37.868
and I went to Rivers meet
to talk to the Captain

25:37.870 --> 25:39.937
about his new orders.

25:39.939 --> 25:42.873
This Ardenian contract was
bullshit from the start,

25:42.875 --> 25:43.774
we all know that.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.710
But a job is a job.

25:46.712 --> 25:50.247
When the Captain backed out
on the deal, I didn't ask why.

25:50.249 --> 25:51.615
He had his reasons.

25:52.818 --> 25:55.152
The last two weeks,
though, have been rough.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.655
We've been on our own,
we've received no pay,

25:57.657 --> 26:00.124
and our quartermasters are
missing and likely dead.

26:00.126 --> 26:02.760
In the opinions of the
commanders,

26:02.762 --> 26:04.962
his new orders crossed
the line and threatened

26:04.964 --> 26:06.931
to needlessly endanger us.

26:06.933 --> 26:08.632
- We've already lost too many.

26:08.634 --> 26:10.801
(crowd mumble)

26:10.802 --> 26:12.969
- Whatever I said to the
Captain is my business.

26:12.972 --> 26:15.005
Suffice to say, he came
this close to dismissing me

26:15.007 --> 26:16.206
for insubordination.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.975
- The regulations say the
penalty

26:17.977 --> 26:19.810
for insubordination is death--

26:19.812 --> 26:22.947
- [Flewellyn] He's being
circumspect, young lady.

26:22.949 --> 26:28.018
- So here it is: Pack your
bags, mend your armor,

26:28.020 --> 26:30.354
sharpen your blades and get some
rest.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.223
We're breaking camp at dawn
to leave Ardenmor for good.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.359
- What changed the Captain's
mind?

26:35.361 --> 26:36.894
- Doesn't matter.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.896
Just tell us the bad news.

26:38.898 --> 26:40.831
There's always bad news
when we get new orders.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.067
- Our most recent spy
reports say a contingent

26:43.069 --> 26:45.803
of Serrinian Knights moved
into southern Ardenmor

26:45.805 --> 26:47.938
and brought a Nu'uman Sorceress
with them.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.640
(all groan)

26:49.641 --> 26:51.341
She twisted a spell-ward
across the southern border

26:51.344 --> 26:53.177
so nothing can cross it.

26:53.179 --> 26:54.812
(Hobnail sniffing)

26:54.814 --> 26:56.046
They don't want this war

26:56.048 --> 26:58.182
spilling over into their
kingdom.

26:58.184 --> 26:59.950
- And what's the bad news?

26:59.952 --> 27:01.986
- We're going west to Stone's
Fall.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.922
At dawn we're gonna take it
from the Nosck troops there,

27:04.924 --> 27:06.407
and then we're gonna
hold it until the rest

27:06.408 --> 27:07.891
of the Broken Swords
arrive from Riversmeet.

27:07.893 --> 27:08.892
- That doesn't sound--

27:08.894 --> 27:13.664
- Stone's Fall is indefensible.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.766
It's a barren hill with
an old mining camp on it

27:15.768 --> 27:16.934
that did its job too well.

27:18.204 --> 27:21.005
For a mile in every
direction there's nothing

27:21.007 --> 27:22.006
but rocky plains.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.708
A small unit of Nosck Gladiators

27:24.710 --> 27:26.877
can easily take us out at
distance.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.846
- I really hate this plan so
far.

27:28.848 --> 27:31.315
- We got lucky tonight when
the Grimhail cleared out.

27:31.317 --> 27:34.852
Now we just need to deal
with the auxiliary units.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.186
Those units don't measure a full
company,

27:36.188 --> 27:39.189
but they still outnumber
us roughly 20 to one.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.575
(Marko whistles)

27:41.576 --> 27:43.960
- It's not too late to come
up with a better plan, is it?

27:43.963 --> 27:45.195
- Someone shoot me.

27:46.699 --> 27:50.801
- Additionally, Judge told
me the Ardenian Rangers

27:50.803 --> 27:52.903
are planning a nasty surprise
for us,

27:52.905 --> 27:55.072
as payback for the Captain's
treachery.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.874
(all groan)

27:56.876 --> 28:00.110
So, assuming we survive all
this,

28:00.112 --> 28:02.813
and once the Broken Swords
regroup,

28:02.815 --> 28:04.281
we'll run north along the border

28:04.283 --> 28:08.018
until we can grab passage
and reach safety in Wayanmar.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.454
- You really pissed off the
Captain this time, didn't you?

28:10.456 --> 28:13.457
- Whatever differences I may
have with him are irrelevant.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.025
This is our only way out.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.778
Three armies are seeing to that.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.429
- This is a suicide mission at
best.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.932
- No, we've got this.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.433
How many close scrapes
have we gotten into before?

28:22.435 --> 28:23.333
Too many to count.

28:23.335 --> 28:24.468
We're golden!

28:24.470 --> 28:27.171
- You stupid cow!

28:27.173 --> 28:30.040
Just tie your torc to your hutch
and pray

28:30.042 --> 28:33.043
that the scavengers that
find it in the battlefield

28:33.045 --> 28:36.046
give you a proper send-off
to the Sword Halls.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.048
Not like you deserve it.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.483
- You're such an asshole.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.818
Down the middle.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.486
- All right, dismissed.

28:42.488 --> 28:44.221
We've got a long day ahead of
us.

28:52.431 --> 28:53.363
- What's the word?

28:58.204 --> 28:59.103
Bad?

29:00.873 --> 29:03.774
- You know that fiefdom in
Serrinia you've always wanted?

29:04.877 --> 29:06.076
You're gonna have to settle

29:06.077 --> 29:07.276
for an unmarked grave in
Ardenmor.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.148
(ominous music)

29:13.119 --> 29:13.984
- Great.

29:16.756 --> 29:19.289
(thunder roars)

29:22.194 --> 29:25.095
(candle flickers)

29:28.267 --> 29:29.933
(suspenseful music)

29:29.935 --> 29:31.769
- [Flewellyn] Judge's perimeter
ward.

29:31.771 --> 29:32.937
- Contact!

29:32.938 --> 29:34.104
North and south perimeters!

29:34.106 --> 29:35.589
- They're lining up fire arrows.

29:35.590 --> 29:37.073
- Samada sharpeye, southeast
squad!

29:38.177 --> 29:39.810
- Sharpeye, northwest quad!

29:39.812 --> 29:41.111
One support unit.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.112
All Samada.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.130
- Give me a target.

29:43.131 --> 29:44.147
- You know Mama Kindeep's whore
house

29:44.150 --> 29:46.116
across from our inn in Solyn?

29:46.118 --> 29:46.984
- Yes, I do.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.051
- Daisy Cutter's window.

29:48.053 --> 29:48.986
Go.

29:49.955 --> 29:52.322
(arrow fires)

29:53.959 --> 29:56.927
Close, you would have killed
Hatty Brineshaw with that shot.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.128
- Oh no, I liked her.

29:58.130 --> 29:59.830
- Fredrick Jack-in-the-Hole, go!

30:01.267 --> 30:04.134
(arrows firing)

30:04.136 --> 30:05.402
- Are you kill-stealing from
Reaper?

30:05.404 --> 30:07.504
- I can't help it, she's so
slow.

30:07.506 --> 30:10.274
Don't think I don't see you,
you pieces of Samada shit!

30:10.276 --> 30:11.175
- [Buttercup] Thumper!

30:13.212 --> 30:15.546
(explodes)

30:31.063 --> 30:33.864
(Kaylee sobbing)

30:36.068 --> 30:38.535
(horse neighs)

30:42.208 --> 30:43.841
- Hob, flame ward!

30:43.843 --> 30:45.142
Not yet.
- But (groans).

30:47.246 --> 30:48.245
- It won't last long.

30:48.247 --> 30:49.947
- Old man, protect Kaylee.

30:52.017 --> 30:53.250
Give me ranges!

30:53.252 --> 30:54.852
(arrows firing)

30:54.854 --> 30:57.221
(suspenseful music)

30:57.223 --> 30:58.088
- Thumper!

30:59.024 --> 31:00.123
50 strides!

31:00.125 --> 31:05.262
(arrow fires)
(arrow explodes)

31:05.264 --> 31:07.264
(arrow thuds)

31:07.266 --> 31:10.334
(suspenseful music)

31:14.139 --> 31:15.172
- 30 strides!

31:15.174 --> 31:18.075
(arrows firing)

31:20.012 --> 31:22.346
- (groans) We need blades out
there!

31:22.348 --> 31:24.248
These assholes are enchanted!

31:27.353 --> 31:28.585
- If anything comes through that
door,

31:28.587 --> 31:29.987
you have to stay behind me!

31:29.989 --> 31:31.555
I can't protect you otherwise.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.223
- Son of a bitch!

31:35.160 --> 31:38.428
(groans) Son of a bitch!

31:39.331 --> 31:40.197
(arrow explodes)

31:40.199 --> 31:41.965
(Reaper yelps)

31:41.967 --> 31:43.934
Son of a bitch!

31:43.936 --> 31:45.269
- Enough of this.

31:45.271 --> 31:46.203
Stop them.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.371
- It'll weaken me.

31:47.373 --> 31:49.439
I need my strength for Stone's
Fall.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.041
- [Top] This could go all night.

31:51.043 --> 31:51.675
Do it.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.010
- We have a problem.

31:53.012 --> 31:53.977
- What now?

31:53.979 --> 31:56.313
- Reaper fell out of the window.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.615
- [Top] Judge, northwest quad
in--

31:58.617 --> 32:00.017
- This is gonna hurt.

32:00.019 --> 32:00.918
- Five!

32:00.920 --> 32:01.618
Go!

32:02.421 --> 32:05.355
(Slab grunting)

32:05.357 --> 32:11.361
(Slab's berserk raging)
(all groaning)

32:18.203 --> 32:20.037
- Fuck you, Hob!

32:20.039 --> 32:22.339
A little warning next time!

32:23.208 --> 32:25.309
- Oh, shit, that hurt.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.945
Did she--
- Bitch amplified

32:27.947 --> 32:29.146
her shriekers.

32:31.383 --> 32:34.384
(Marko groaning)

32:46.131 --> 32:47.030
- Reaper?

32:48.567 --> 32:51.301
(Top panting)

32:55.341 --> 32:56.239
- Report.

32:57.443 --> 32:59.509
- [Marko On The Torc] Ghostwatch
clear.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.611
I think the sharp eye got away,
though.

33:06.485 --> 33:09.419
- [Whisper] What the hell, Hob?!

33:13.025 --> 33:14.625
- Dogwatch clear.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.226
- [Top On The Torc] We
only got the backlash.

33:16.228 --> 33:18.261
The Samada should have
been torn inside out.

33:18.263 --> 33:19.396
- Looks like they were.

33:19.397 --> 33:20.530
Gave Slab and Judge enough time
to murder

33:20.532 --> 33:22.332
the shit out of 'em (laughs).

33:22.334 --> 33:25.435
- (screaming) No!

33:25.437 --> 33:27.304
No, no, no, no, no.

33:29.742 --> 33:30.640
No!

33:32.211 --> 33:33.110
Fuck you!

33:33.712 --> 33:36.079
Cocksucking whoremongers!

33:37.683 --> 33:40.217
I will kill you!

33:40.219 --> 33:42.185
I will kill all of you!

33:44.390 --> 33:46.456
Fuck you, lord of light!

33:48.527 --> 33:51.294
I'll kill them, brother.

33:51.296 --> 33:54.197
I will kill all of them.

33:56.101 --> 33:59.469
I swear on both our god's marks.

33:59.471 --> 34:02.305
(intense music)

34:09.148 --> 34:10.313
- Here you go.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.214
Easy, girl.

34:17.389 --> 34:19.623
- Tell Marko that sharp
eye didn't get away.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.360
- What did I miss?

34:23.362 --> 34:25.228
- I think we lost Switch.

34:25.798 --> 34:26.730
- Was it me?

34:26.732 --> 34:28.498
- Not this time.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.267
Your spell worked as intended.

34:51.690 --> 34:52.722
- Switch is dead.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.226
- Yeah.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.502
- You're next if you knock
me out of the window again.

35:06.472 --> 35:07.370
- Yeah.

35:11.310 --> 35:13.610
(softly) Ah!
(Reaper laughs)

35:13.612 --> 35:16.446
(both laughing)

35:32.498 --> 35:33.497
- (softly) Switch is dead.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.338
- [Marko] Come on.

35:41.340 --> 35:43.507
(groans)

35:54.353 --> 35:55.185
- Let him go, Buttercup.

35:55.187 --> 35:56.153
- He was a good man.

35:57.356 --> 35:58.722
- He wasn't good.

35:58.724 --> 36:00.290
None of us is good.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.560
He was only in it for the money.

36:06.365 --> 36:07.364
It doesn't matter.

36:07.366 --> 36:12.235
He'll always be my brother,
and I will see him avenged.

36:15.307 --> 36:16.206
- All right.

36:18.177 --> 36:18.875
Let's do this.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.515
(mysterious music)

36:37.930 --> 36:38.828
Kaylee.

36:43.202 --> 36:46.203
- Switch's Testament entrusts
his soul-hutch to DJ,

36:46.205 --> 36:49.739
and splits his back pay
between both Buttercup and DJ

36:49.741 --> 36:54.211
excluding the seven gold he
owes Hobnail from stones night.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.646
Who witnesses this?

36:56.648 --> 36:58.615
- On my honor, I witness this.

36:58.617 --> 37:02.385
- Moreover, his Testament
designates that both the hutch

37:02.387 --> 37:04.754
and DJ's portion of his
back pay are death ransom,

37:04.756 --> 37:07.824
to be taken in good faith
to his family in Talinor.

37:07.826 --> 37:09.070
- What?!

37:09.071 --> 37:10.315
- [Top] Who witnesses this?
(Whisper snickers)

37:10.316 --> 37:11.560
- [Kaylee] On my honor, I
witness this.

37:11.563 --> 37:13.363
- That son of a bitch!

37:13.365 --> 37:14.497
There's a huge bounty
on my head in Talinor!

37:14.499 --> 37:16.499
I knew he hated me.

37:16.501 --> 37:18.568
(strains)

37:18.570 --> 37:21.304
- All swords, Chopshop, two
minutes.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.774
(eerie music)

37:42.594 --> 37:47.664
- O' Mighty Lords and
Champions of the Sword Halls.

37:51.637 --> 37:55.572
Our brother, Switch, stands
before your gates at last.

37:57.342 --> 37:59.843
By our blood, his ransom shall
be paid.

38:02.481 --> 38:05.715
We beseech you now, let him
enter,

38:06.752 --> 38:10.720
for he is the worthiest of
warriors!

38:12.491 --> 38:14.591
His aim was ever keen.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.730
His courage was ever resolute.

38:21.967 --> 38:25.568
Let him sit an honored man at
your table!

38:27.673 --> 38:30.974
Reunite him with fallen
comrades and lost loves!

38:33.512 --> 38:38.515
Bring forth vanquished
foes to kneel at his feet!

38:40.352 --> 38:41.618
He has earned it!

38:47.693 --> 38:50.760
(melancholic music)

38:56.768 --> 38:58.601
- He died with honor.

38:58.603 --> 39:01.004
- [All] His honor is our honor.

39:02.474 --> 39:05.542
(melancholic music)

39:06.645 --> 39:08.545
- (softly) That'll do.

39:08.547 --> 39:11.614
(melancholic music)

39:40.145 --> 39:42.412
- You're posted to the
B.F.R. with Buttercup

39:42.414 --> 39:43.113
until we decamp.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.715
Keep a close eye on her.

40:04.169 --> 40:06.736
(eerie music)

40:10.442 --> 40:11.708
- Stop it.

40:11.710 --> 40:12.609
- [DJ] Stop what?

40:17.015 --> 40:19.716
- Stop thinking that it's yours.

40:21.720 --> 40:22.619
- I'll cut you.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.755
- You're no throat slitter, DJ.

40:25.757 --> 40:26.589
- And you're no thief.

40:26.591 --> 40:27.791
Give it back.

40:27.793 --> 40:28.892
(DJ groans)

40:28.894 --> 40:31.694
(whimpers) Fuck!

40:31.696 --> 40:33.596
- [Whisper] Let's see what we've
got.

40:38.003 --> 40:40.970
- That's his share of the
treasure from Black Ridge
Canyon.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.474
Hand it over, Whisper, it's
mine.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.009
- [Whisper] It's Switch's,

40:46.011 --> 40:48.111
and you're going to honor his
Testament.

41:03.228 --> 41:05.628
- He knew what I was
when he gave it to me!

41:07.666 --> 41:09.165
I think he wanted me to steal
it,

41:09.167 --> 41:12.235
because if he didn't he would
have given it to someone

41:12.237 --> 41:15.238
with more willpower!

41:15.239 --> 41:18.240
- Do you think that anyone's
gonna carry your death ransom

41:18.243 --> 41:19.843
after you steal Switch's?

41:19.845 --> 41:22.078
- That's somewhat different.

41:22.080 --> 41:23.713
- He chose you!

41:23.715 --> 41:25.915
Only the gods know why,

41:25.917 --> 41:28.251
but it must have been
something worthwhile.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.220
Do not prove him wrong.

41:30.222 --> 41:33.022
You will honor his death
by carrying his ransom

41:33.024 --> 41:34.491
to those whom it's owed.

41:34.493 --> 41:37.794
- But I could finally
buy myself an estate,

41:37.796 --> 41:38.695
a fiefdom.

41:39.764 --> 41:42.532
- Gold makes you stupid, my
friend.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.601
That's why Top put me with you.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.035
Be better than this.

41:46.037 --> 41:48.705
(ominous music)

41:52.777 --> 41:55.578
(dramatic music)

42:01.820 --> 42:04.954
(DJ groaning softly)

42:09.828 --> 42:10.760
- What's his name?

42:11.997 --> 42:13.863
- What makes you think it's a
he?

42:14.799 --> 42:16.032
- [Kaylee] I just know.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.602
- You never asked before.

42:21.006 --> 42:21.905
Why now?

42:22.874 --> 42:24.841
- I was afraid before.

42:24.843 --> 42:26.976
- [Flewellyn] What's changed?

42:26.978 --> 42:28.278
- I'm no longer afraid.

42:28.280 --> 42:33.850
- Your goddess, won't she
be jealous if you flirt

42:33.852 --> 42:35.852
with the affections of another
god?

42:36.821 --> 42:38.655
- She's fickle, but, no.

42:38.657 --> 42:41.057
She favors the warrior-born.

42:41.059 --> 42:45.061
And while she may not
always mend our wounds,

42:45.063 --> 42:48.565
it's her river that carries
us toward the Sword Halls.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.900
All she cares for is
the appropriate respect.

42:54.272 --> 42:55.338
- I'm tired, Kaylee.

42:58.877 --> 43:01.644
I've watched so many of you die.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.253
I don't think I can do this
anymore.

43:10.255 --> 43:15.858
- Don't worry, old man, I'll
protect you.

43:17.295 --> 43:20.163
And when you're tired,
I'll be your strength.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.064
- Indeed.

43:25.737 --> 43:26.369
- What are you doing?

43:26.371 --> 43:27.870
- Here take it.

43:27.872 --> 43:28.771
It's yours.

43:30.342 --> 43:33.076
If we get out of this
mess, I intend to retire.

43:34.112 --> 43:36.379
Congratulations, my dear.

43:36.381 --> 43:38.114
You drew the short straw.

43:38.116 --> 43:40.183
- Wait a minute, I don't--
- I hope

43:40.185 --> 43:42.885
someday you can find it in
your heart to forgive me.

43:53.932 --> 43:55.832
- I need to attend to Switch.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.001
Tell Slab to bring the Samada
head in.

44:25.263 --> 44:26.729
- [Marko] What?

44:26.731 --> 44:28.364
- Top sent you to babysit me.

44:29.734 --> 44:30.900
- So what?

44:31.936 --> 44:33.269
He wants to make sure you're
okay.

44:33.271 --> 44:34.370
- I'm not okay.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.939
I just lost my best friend.

44:39.411 --> 44:41.711
But that's what we do, isn't it?

44:41.713 --> 44:44.347
(rain trickling)

44:45.283 --> 44:46.783
We wage war.

44:53.158 --> 44:55.224
We all knew the risks when we
signed on.

44:55.226 --> 44:58.027
That doesn't mean I won't mourn
him.

44:58.029 --> 45:04.400
But if you think for one moment
my grief will slow my sword,

45:04.402 --> 45:06.102
try me, slave boy.

45:12.343 --> 45:13.976
- I'll ignore what you just said

45:14.946 --> 45:16.913
because we're in the same unit

45:18.817 --> 45:20.049
and because you're mourning.

45:23.254 --> 45:24.454
But friend or not,

45:26.725 --> 45:28.758
if you call me that again,

45:28.760 --> 45:30.860
I'll rip your gods damned throat
out.

45:33.264 --> 45:34.997
(scoffs)

45:34.999 --> 45:38.034
(rain trickling)

45:42.841 --> 45:43.906
- I'm sorry.

45:51.449 --> 45:53.950
- You're my new roommate or
somethin'?

45:53.952 --> 45:55.985
- [Hobnail] I don't wanna
be anywhere near Kaylee

45:55.987 --> 45:59.222
when she does that thing to that
body.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.427
- Why do you always smell so
foosty?

46:10.401 --> 46:13.236
(Hobnail sniffs)

46:22.213 --> 46:24.180
- I don't understand you.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.098
- You've known me for years.

46:25.099 --> 46:26.015
What's not to understand?

46:27.385 --> 46:29.318
- Why do you always stick up for
me?

46:30.355 --> 46:33.055
What did I ever do to you?

46:33.057 --> 46:34.457
- Maybe I like an underdog.

46:35.426 --> 46:38.161
- A warmage is never an
underdog.

46:40.498 --> 46:44.066
Besides, you're not my type.

46:44.068 --> 46:44.967
- No, dumb shit.

46:44.969 --> 46:46.803
This isn't about sex.

46:46.805 --> 46:50.072
- Well, I am the only person in
the unit.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.574
- Don't be a petulant ass.

46:51.576 --> 46:54.177
You know I don't bed teammates.

46:55.513 --> 46:56.412
- I...

46:58.116 --> 46:59.816
apologize.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.485
- We're in this shitpot
together.

47:02.487 --> 47:06.355
We stand up for each other
whether we like it or not.

47:06.357 --> 47:08.124
Whether we like you or not.

47:09.527 --> 47:12.161
Haven't you figured that
out after all this time?

47:14.866 --> 47:17.533
- Well, you smell like Autumn!

47:25.076 --> 47:28.978
(chanting in foreign language)

47:28.980 --> 47:31.698
- [Slab] Here.

47:31.699 --> 47:34.417
(chanting in foreign language
continues)

47:42.160 --> 47:43.292
- Ooh, Shiny.

47:48.900 --> 47:51.000
Now I don't have to desecrate
Switch.

47:51.002 --> 47:57.073
- Can't you ask your goddess
to just bring him back?

47:59.377 --> 48:01.611
- (sighs) That's not how it
works.

48:02.580 --> 48:03.913
- [Slab] Yeah, I know.

48:10.622 --> 48:11.587
- Talk to me, Slab.

48:11.589 --> 48:13.022
You're troubled.

48:13.024 --> 48:14.257
- What we're doing is wrong.

48:15.193 --> 48:17.126
It's not our way!

48:17.128 --> 48:19.562
Stone's Fall is a Coward's
Gauntlet

48:19.564 --> 48:22.331
and nobody wants to run it just
to go die!

48:22.333 --> 48:23.566
There's no honor in it!

48:25.436 --> 48:27.236
- Well, speaking as your healer,

48:28.206 --> 48:31.040
one death, same as the next.

48:31.042 --> 48:37.079
Messy, often slow, always
agonizing.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.682
But speaking as your squadmate,

48:39.684 --> 48:43.953
how you die matters more than
why you die.

48:43.955 --> 48:49.191
Anyways, when you go, it'll
likely be as a fat old man

48:49.193 --> 48:51.227
surrounded by a gaggle of
grandchildren.

48:51.229 --> 48:54.363
They'll have to roll you into
your grave.

48:54.365 --> 48:55.531
- You really think so?

48:57.669 --> 49:01.237
- (sighs deeply) No.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.940
You're gonna die at Stone's
Fall with the rest of us.

49:05.443 --> 49:06.943
- You're probably right.

49:09.113 --> 49:11.514
- You might wanna leave the
room before you get wet.

49:14.319 --> 49:17.553
(Flewellyn whistling)

49:23.594 --> 49:25.628
- May I make a suggestion?

49:25.630 --> 49:26.529
- Can I stop you?

49:28.399 --> 49:30.166
- Encourage the others to treat
Kaylee

49:30.168 --> 49:33.970
like the soldier she is and not
the child they think she is.

49:33.972 --> 49:34.704
- What's goin' on?

49:36.341 --> 49:37.340
- Nothing, my friend.

49:39.277 --> 49:41.344
(sighs) The years weigh heavily
on me.

49:43.181 --> 49:45.181
It may be time to inspire them.

49:45.183 --> 49:47.416
Kaylee has much wisdom in her.

49:47.418 --> 49:50.019
- And I suspect one day far in
the future,

49:50.021 --> 49:52.154
whatever you're on about is
gonna hit me

49:53.091 --> 49:55.024
and I'm gonna hate you.

49:55.026 --> 49:58.194
(Flewellyn chuckles)

50:03.334 --> 50:06.202
(Hobnail breathing heavily)

50:06.204 --> 50:09.271
(creatures moaning)

50:18.349 --> 50:19.749
(massive water splashes)

50:19.751 --> 50:21.117
- What's your problem?

50:21.119 --> 50:23.686
You know we can't leave his body
here.

50:23.688 --> 50:28.190
- Feeding our dead to
that thing is unnatural.

50:28.192 --> 50:31.694
- That thing carried his
soul to the Sword Halls

50:31.696 --> 50:36.432
on her mistress's River,
why not his body too?

50:36.434 --> 50:41.037
- At least my magic is
honest in its foulness.

50:41.039 --> 50:43.572
What's her excuse?

50:43.574 --> 50:45.674
(retches)

50:49.047 --> 50:50.746
- Check on Kaylee.

50:50.748 --> 50:53.382
She does not do well after
communing with whats-her-face,

50:53.384 --> 50:56.552
and you are the only one who
doesn't get creeped out by it.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.354
- Oh, I get creeped out by it.

50:58.356 --> 50:59.789
I'm just too old to care.

51:04.762 --> 51:06.629
- I wasn't always like this.

51:06.631 --> 51:09.065
- Your kind always says that.

51:09.067 --> 51:10.699
- What does that mean?

51:10.701 --> 51:12.168
- Nobles.

51:12.170 --> 51:13.569
We all know you're one.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.089
I wouldn't be surprised

51:16.090 --> 51:17.807
if you had a line of
titles behind your name.

51:17.809 --> 51:19.542
Lord Spungdington?

51:20.344 --> 51:21.811
Baron Mourningwood?

51:21.813 --> 51:23.746
Lady Rosepurse?

51:25.149 --> 51:27.383
- My full name is Dhuveth
Jarinis.

51:27.385 --> 51:29.819
(Whisper laughs)

51:29.821 --> 51:32.721
My father is a fief holder
sworn to the lord of Serrinia.

51:32.723 --> 51:35.858
- Dhuveth is a whore's name.

51:35.860 --> 51:37.526
- He's also an arrogant son of a
bitch

51:37.528 --> 51:38.727
who never wasted an opportunity

51:38.729 --> 51:40.663
to tell me how worthless I was.

51:40.665 --> 51:44.500
- Maybe save all this deep
emotional crap for a confessor.

51:44.502 --> 51:46.402
- On the day he banished me,

51:46.404 --> 51:48.671
he gave me an old heirloom
dagger.

51:48.673 --> 51:50.673
Same one I stole from his trophy
case

51:50.675 --> 51:53.175
the night before I made
a decision to murder him.

51:53.177 --> 51:55.111
- You're a seriously messed up
individual.

51:55.113 --> 51:56.245
You know that, right?

51:56.247 --> 51:59.815
- It's the only thing of
value he's ever given me.

52:01.419 --> 52:03.619
He suggested I cut my own throat
with it.

52:06.424 --> 52:08.357
- Tell me you slit his throat
instead,

52:08.359 --> 52:10.793
then maybe I'll have a
little respect for you.

52:13.364 --> 52:14.263
- I couldn't.

52:15.433 --> 52:17.299
He's still my father.

52:17.301 --> 52:19.902
(rain trickling)

52:32.150 --> 52:33.883
- Switch was one of us, DJ.

52:34.819 --> 52:35.718
Why?

52:35.720 --> 52:38.587
- Because after all these
years in the Swords,

52:38.589 --> 52:39.922
I still don't have it.

52:39.924 --> 52:43.559
I still don't have enough
gold to buy my own lands.

52:43.561 --> 52:47.763
How else am I gonna show my
father who's the better man?

52:47.765 --> 52:51.433
- You would deny Switch his
place in the Sword Halls?

52:52.870 --> 52:54.837
Don't show him who the better
man is, DJ.

52:54.839 --> 52:55.905
Be the better man.

52:56.841 --> 52:58.674
I should cut your heart out.

53:11.822 --> 53:15.491
- I once visited a temple
dedicated to your watery goddess

53:15.493 --> 53:16.959
on the Corsican Isles.

53:18.863 --> 53:23.432
On a beach perfectly situated to
capture

53:23.434 --> 53:24.833
the setting sun each day.

53:25.903 --> 53:27.836
Regardless of weather or season,

53:27.838 --> 53:30.806
it always made it through to her
altar

53:30.808 --> 53:32.341
to kiss her on the brow.

53:34.512 --> 53:36.579
There's something else about
that isle.

53:37.415 --> 53:38.714
Unlike all the others,

53:40.251 --> 53:43.786
it was blessedly free of seagull
crap.

53:43.788 --> 53:46.589
(Kaylee laughs)

53:46.591 --> 53:48.424
- She doesn't have any more
temples.

53:48.426 --> 53:49.959
The sea reclaimed them all.

53:49.961 --> 53:51.360
- As you say.

53:51.362 --> 53:53.495
This was well before your time.

53:53.497 --> 53:55.564
- Yeah, by at least a hundred
years.

54:02.873 --> 54:03.872
- Give us the room.

54:12.583 --> 54:14.450
- You shouldn't get drunk
before battle, you ass.

54:14.452 --> 54:16.318
Are you trying to get us all
killed?

54:19.290 --> 54:20.356
- We're dead anyway.

54:21.559 --> 54:22.958
- That's Flewellyn's.

54:25.029 --> 54:26.996
(DJ gulps)

54:26.998 --> 54:29.632
- Whisper called me out.

54:29.634 --> 54:31.333
I wanted to steal Switch's gold.

54:32.770 --> 54:35.371
- (hits him on the leg) She
should have cut your heart out.

54:36.007 --> 54:37.606
- That was her opinion too.

54:42.980 --> 54:45.481
(DJ moans)

54:47.885 --> 54:51.020
- At least you're honest.

54:51.022 --> 54:51.954
- And you're wet.

54:53.724 --> 54:57.393
(DJ grunts)
(both giggles)

54:57.395 --> 54:58.627
- Got it.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.496
And, Samozar, stop worrying.

55:00.498 --> 55:01.397
If the,

55:02.333 --> 55:04.400
all the units do their part.

55:04.402 --> 55:05.567
The plan will work.

55:07.071 --> 55:08.404
- Care to tell me what you're
doing

55:08.406 --> 55:09.805
with the Captain's Torc?

55:13.010 --> 55:15.377
(rain trickling)

55:15.379 --> 55:17.946
- [Top] You and I both know
the Captain suffered most.

55:21.485 --> 55:24.019
I believe it all started at
Cerak's tomb.

55:26.991 --> 55:28.891
- [Flewellyn] That was years
ago.

55:29.727 --> 55:30.959
- The unit commanders,

55:32.763 --> 55:34.963
we all noticed him changing
recently.

55:37.335 --> 55:40.069
It's like another person was
looking out of those eyes.

55:40.071 --> 55:43.405
Um, we just thought it
was the stress of the war,

55:43.407 --> 55:46.442
but it just kept getting worse,
Flewellyn.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.045
- I'm listening.

55:50.047 --> 55:54.450
- The orders he gave us
yesterday would have had us

55:54.452 --> 55:56.618
march directly into the
Samada camp to surrender.

55:56.620 --> 55:58.020
And they don't take prisoners.

56:02.426 --> 56:03.559
So, we confronted him.

56:04.695 --> 56:06.962
Called him out on both the
orders

56:06.964 --> 56:09.965
and his increasingly strange
behavior.

56:12.136 --> 56:15.504
He accused us of breaking our
oaths

56:16.640 --> 56:21.677
to the Sword's, to him, and lost
control.

56:26.450 --> 56:31.387
Before we knew it, he had pulled
his blade

56:31.389 --> 56:32.888
and slashed Boxwise's throat.

56:33.758 --> 56:36.525
(eerie music)

56:38.729 --> 56:41.029
At that point, we had no choice.

56:41.031 --> 56:43.632
(eerie music)

56:46.570 --> 56:49.838
(Buttercup whimpering)

56:55.813 --> 56:57.546
- Hey, are you okay?

56:59.550 --> 57:01.483
- Yeah, I'm fine.

57:06.924 --> 57:07.890
Really, I'm fine.

57:20.604 --> 57:22.321
- Do you think the dark magic

57:22.322 --> 57:24.039
that Hob has been ranting about
all night

57:24.041 --> 57:26.508
is tied to Cerak's madness?

57:26.510 --> 57:27.209
- I don't know.

57:29.747 --> 57:30.579
- You took his torc.

57:30.581 --> 57:31.680
What about his hutch?

57:32.883 --> 57:34.149
- He wasn't wearing one.

57:40.090 --> 57:42.691
- This batch is bitter, I like
it.

57:44.161 --> 57:46.662
- Is that supposed to be a
compliment

57:46.664 --> 57:48.530
or you want seaweed and
sunlight?

57:48.532 --> 57:51.099
- Overwatch, report.

57:51.101 --> 57:52.601
- [Reaper On The Torc]
Ghostwatch, all quiet.

57:52.603 --> 57:53.635
- [Whisper On The Torc]
Dogwatch, clear.

57:53.637 --> 57:54.536
Someone keep an eye on DJ,
though.

57:54.538 --> 57:56.672
He's drunk off his ass.

57:56.674 --> 57:59.675
- BFR, you good up there?

57:59.677 --> 58:01.643
- [Marko On The Torc] All clear,
boss.

58:01.645 --> 58:05.614
- Everyone get some rest
and conserve your strength.

58:05.616 --> 58:06.648
Come dawn, you're gonna need it.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.617
- I can never sleep before
battle.

58:10.554 --> 58:11.253
- Top.

58:12.690 --> 58:15.858
Take your hand and place
it on your god's mark

58:15.860 --> 58:18.660
and speak truth.

58:18.662 --> 58:20.996
Are we getting out of this?

58:20.998 --> 58:26.068
Because by my hand on my mark,
I believe we are all doomed

58:29.707 --> 58:32.608
and we only have you to blame
for it.

58:32.610 --> 58:33.742
- Hobnail, you cross--

58:33.744 --> 58:35.511
- No, Flewellyn, she's right.

58:37.181 --> 58:39.982
(dramatic music)

58:42.553 --> 58:43.585
- Is DJ with you?

58:44.655 --> 58:45.587
- I haven't seen him.

58:46.757 --> 58:48.690
He's probably with the water
witch.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.792
- Ugh, Kaylee creeps me out.

58:52.062 --> 58:54.062
- Hey, can I ask you somethin'?

58:54.064 --> 58:55.597
- [Whisper On The Torc] No.

58:55.599 --> 58:56.999
- Are you worried?

58:57.001 --> 58:57.900
- No.

58:59.069 --> 59:03.205
- Stone's Fall is gonna be bad.

59:03.207 --> 59:04.773
- Stone's Fall is going to be
glorious.

59:04.775 --> 59:06.074
I'm gonna kill everything.

59:06.076 --> 59:08.577
- We've never been this
outnumbered.

59:08.579 --> 59:09.711
- It is what it is.

59:13.751 --> 59:18.587
- On my god's mark, I will
do everything in my power

59:18.589 --> 59:19.988
to get you all out of this alive

59:19.990 --> 59:22.224
even if I have to sacrifice my
life.

59:23.127 --> 59:24.660
(Hobnail scoffs)

59:24.661 --> 59:26.194
- With all the Swords
combined, it's 120 of us

59:26.196 --> 59:30.666
and 12 warmages against
four units of half giants

59:30.668 --> 59:31.633
and an army of templars.

59:31.635 --> 59:32.668
That's--

59:32.670 --> 59:34.770
- 3,000 enemy soldiers.

59:34.772 --> 59:38.240
Our destiny was set the moment
we set foot in Ardenmor.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.459
Top is not to blame.

59:40.460 --> 59:42.677
- Strategically and
tactically, nothing's changed.

59:42.680 --> 59:45.847
We came into this country to
harass the Nosck and Samada,

59:45.849 --> 59:46.949
and that's what we're
going to do on our way out.

59:46.951 --> 59:49.001
- That was a skirmish war.

59:49.002 --> 59:51.052
All we had to do is discourage
them from hurting the locals

59:51.055 --> 59:53.689
and now you got us going
headlong right into their lines.

59:53.691 --> 59:55.223
Strategically, that's terrible.

59:55.225 --> 59:56.758
- [Top] Leave the strategy to
people

59:56.760 --> 59:57.893
like me who understands--

59:57.895 --> 59:59.895
- The locals are after our
blood.

59:59.896 --> 1:00:01.896
18 Ardenian Rangers are
nothing to take lightly.

1:00:01.899 --> 1:00:03.332
Each one fights like five men.

1:00:03.334 --> 1:00:05.067
- Five men?

1:00:05.069 --> 1:00:07.202
Have you seen Judge?

1:00:07.204 --> 1:00:10.272
Try 15 insane berserkers!

1:00:10.274 --> 1:00:13.909
- You know Judge led those
Rangers once long ago, Hob,

1:00:13.911 --> 1:00:16.345
but is a broken sword above all.

1:00:18.849 --> 1:00:20.148
We can't do this without you.

1:00:21.685 --> 1:00:23.085
You need to stay strong.

1:00:24.021 --> 1:00:25.687
Do you understand?

1:00:27.992 --> 1:00:30.792
(dramatic music)

1:00:40.070 --> 1:00:41.169
- My turn now.

1:00:41.171 --> 1:00:42.754
You were a Black Arrow

1:00:42.755 --> 1:00:44.338
with the Royal Guard of Talinor,
right?

1:00:44.341 --> 1:00:46.742
Why'd you break your sword with
them

1:00:46.744 --> 1:00:49.077
and swear our oaths instead?

1:00:49.079 --> 1:00:51.179
- What difference does it make?

1:00:51.181 --> 1:00:52.748
- It doesn't.

1:00:52.749 --> 1:00:54.316
I just wanna win the bet
the others have going.

1:00:54.318 --> 1:00:55.183
I said murder.

1:00:55.185 --> 1:00:56.251
Did you murder someone?

1:00:59.289 --> 1:01:02.391
- In Talinor, a woman
may only carry a weapon

1:01:02.393 --> 1:01:05.260
if she serves in the Royal Guard

1:01:05.262 --> 1:01:08.397
or as a widow with no man to
protect her.

1:01:08.399 --> 1:01:11.133
As a soldier, I was strictly
ornamental.

1:01:11.135 --> 1:01:12.801
Even though I was well-trained
and better

1:01:12.803 --> 1:01:14.202
than the king's myrmidons.

1:01:14.204 --> 1:01:16.705
I was never sent into battle,

1:01:16.707 --> 1:01:18.674
I wasn't expected to do
anything.

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:21.910
No one could get within
a league of the king.

1:01:21.912 --> 1:01:24.680
Not with his pet mage around.

1:01:26.984 --> 1:01:30.919
I broke my sword because I
needed to fight in battle.

1:01:30.921 --> 1:01:32.387
- When the sun rises today,

1:01:32.389 --> 1:01:35.791
you'll fight until your arms go
limp

1:01:35.793 --> 1:01:38.193
and you will stand atop
a mountain of dead foes.

1:01:38.195 --> 1:01:42.297
And when the rest of the
bastards
finally come to kill you,

1:01:42.299 --> 1:01:45.734
you will enter the Sword Halls a
legend.

1:01:45.736 --> 1:01:48.737
- You better pray those
bastards don't kill me

1:01:48.739 --> 1:01:51.406
'cause you're the one who
gets to carry my death ransom.

1:01:52.342 --> 1:01:53.241
- I hate you.

1:01:55.212 --> 1:01:56.778
- [Reaper On The Torc] I need to
piss.

1:01:56.780 --> 1:01:58.113
- [Whisper On The Torc] Go
ahead.

1:01:58.114 --> 1:01:59.447
I'll tell Buttercup and Marko

1:01:59.448 --> 1:02:00.781
to keep an eye on the southeast
approach.

1:02:02.286 --> 1:02:05.120
(dramatic music)

1:02:15.899 --> 1:02:18.834
- Someone needs to tell DJ
to get back to his post.

1:02:18.836 --> 1:02:20.502
We're just trying to decide who.

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:23.805
- Why are you telling me this?

1:02:23.807 --> 1:02:26.308
- Because he's still with
Kaylee.

1:02:27.244 --> 1:02:28.477
- (sighs) Damn it.

1:02:29.346 --> 1:02:30.979
- Since you're standing up.

1:02:32.816 --> 1:02:34.249
- I need a drink first.

1:02:34.251 --> 1:02:35.517
(Kaylee and DJ moaning)

1:02:35.519 --> 1:02:36.852
(faint voice talking)

1:02:36.854 --> 1:02:39.821
- [Kaylee] Oh my god.

1:02:39.823 --> 1:02:40.922
Oh yeah.

1:02:41.525 --> 1:02:45.026
(Kaylee panting)

1:02:45.028 --> 1:02:46.194
Please don't stop.

1:02:46.196 --> 1:02:47.529
Oh, don't stop.

1:02:47.531 --> 1:02:49.865
(Kaylee panting)

1:02:49.867 --> 1:02:53.368
Just like that (panting).

1:02:53.370 --> 1:02:56.304
(Kaylee moaning)
(DJ grunting)

1:02:56.306 --> 1:02:58.006
- Top wants you back on watch.

1:02:58.008 --> 1:03:00.909
(both panting)

1:03:09.953 --> 1:03:12.220
- Don't worry, I'll
kill her when we decamp.

1:03:12.222 --> 1:03:13.789
I'll slit her throat.

1:03:13.791 --> 1:03:14.990
- Don't.

1:03:14.992 --> 1:03:16.892
I've got next meal duty.

1:03:16.894 --> 1:03:19.494
Been saving a Nosckian
mushroom just for her.

1:03:19.496 --> 1:03:22.931
I can slip it into her rice.

1:03:22.933 --> 1:03:25.534
(dramatic music)

1:03:32.109 --> 1:03:33.041
- How bad was it?

1:03:36.313 --> 1:03:37.979
- No worse than usual.

1:03:38.949 --> 1:03:42.050
(Hobnail retches)

1:03:43.954 --> 1:03:46.955
(rain trickling)

1:03:52.963 --> 1:03:55.564
(ominous music)

1:04:16.053 --> 1:04:19.221
(Hobnail sniffing)

1:04:19.223 --> 1:04:22.023
(ominous music)

1:04:37.074 --> 1:04:39.941
(suspenseful music)

1:04:39.943 --> 1:04:42.210
(Hobnail grunting)

1:04:42.212 --> 1:04:44.079
(Hobnail speaking in foreign
language)

1:04:44.081 --> 1:04:45.080
- [Top] Hold her down!

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:47.349
- [Slab] What happened?

1:04:47.350 --> 1:04:49.617
(Hobnail speaking in foreign
language)

1:04:49.620 --> 1:04:50.952
- It's here.

1:04:50.954 --> 1:04:52.187
(grunting) It's here.

1:04:52.188 --> 1:04:53.421
- What in the Seven Hells is
happening?

1:04:53.423 --> 1:04:54.623
Is she possessed?
- I don't know.

1:04:54.625 --> 1:04:55.991
- Shoggotha!

1:04:55.993 --> 1:04:58.126
(grunting) I must stop it!

1:04:58.128 --> 1:05:01.263
(suspenseful music)

1:05:19.650 --> 1:05:22.384
(intense music)

1:05:39.236 --> 1:05:44.306
(Buttercup grunting)
(glass shattering)

1:05:44.308 --> 1:05:48.643
(Buttercup breathing heavily)

1:05:51.248 --> 1:05:52.948
(Buttercup grunts)

1:05:52.950 --> 1:05:54.149
- Shoggotha!

1:05:54.151 --> 1:05:56.184
(Hobnail panting)

1:05:56.186 --> 1:05:57.018
Shoggo...

1:05:57.020 --> 1:05:58.119
- Hob?

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:01.489
Hob?

1:06:01.491 --> 1:06:03.241
(Slab groans.)

1:06:03.242 --> 1:06:04.992
- Get off me, you fat meatball!

1:06:04.995 --> 1:06:08.530
(Hobnail breathing heavily)

1:06:21.745 --> 1:06:23.511
- Is it gone?

1:06:23.513 --> 1:06:27.315
- I don't know and I
don't sense it anymore.

1:06:27.317 --> 1:06:28.216
- Talk to us.

1:06:29.052 --> 1:06:30.652
Hob?

1:06:30.654 --> 1:06:35.724
- It felt like Cerak, but it was
weak.

1:06:36.626 --> 1:06:39.060
So unfocused like...

1:06:39.062 --> 1:06:40.195
- Like an echo?

1:06:41.164 --> 1:06:42.497
- Maybe it was the Nosck.

1:06:42.499 --> 1:06:46.067
They worship such dark things.

1:06:46.069 --> 1:06:47.535
- If the Nosck have
necromancers--

1:06:47.537 --> 1:06:49.070
- Then our chances of getting
out of this

1:06:49.072 --> 1:06:51.406
just became nonexistent.

1:06:51.408 --> 1:06:54.242
(rain trickling)

1:07:42.159 --> 1:07:45.260
(ground rumbling)

1:07:53.503 --> 1:07:54.402
- Nosckles.

1:07:58.575 --> 1:08:00.442
What now?

1:08:00.443 --> 1:08:02.310
My balls are still killing me
from the last what now moment.

1:08:02.312 --> 1:08:03.711
- Do you feel that?

1:08:05.348 --> 1:08:06.448
- [Slab] Do you feel that?

1:08:06.450 --> 1:08:08.116
Do you smell that?

1:08:08.118 --> 1:08:10.485
Does this deer testicle
taste funny to you?

1:08:10.487 --> 1:08:12.253
You really need to have
Kaylee check your head out.

1:08:12.255 --> 1:08:14.689
- Do you see me laughing?

1:08:14.691 --> 1:08:16.291
(table vibrating)
- Fuck!

1:08:16.860 --> 1:08:19.561
(arrows clanging)

1:08:19.563 --> 1:08:22.630
(suspenseful music)

1:08:25.435 --> 1:08:27.302
- [Top on the Torc]
All swords, high alert.

1:08:29.673 --> 1:08:31.206
(Marko mumbles)

1:08:31.208 --> 1:08:32.107
- Report!

1:08:32.109 --> 1:08:34.576
- The Nosck can't have
learned the kind of magic

1:08:34.578 --> 1:08:35.477
that affected Hob.

1:08:35.479 --> 1:08:36.567
This must be--

1:08:36.568 --> 1:08:37.656
- [Reaper on the Torc]
Ghostwatch is clear.

1:08:37.657 --> 1:08:38.745
Feels like an earthquake is
coming though.

1:08:38.748 --> 1:08:39.681
- Marko, I,

1:08:41.284 --> 1:08:42.517
I think I...

1:08:42.519 --> 1:08:44.519
- Tell him that we're all clear.

1:08:44.521 --> 1:08:46.621
- I think I might--
- Tell him!

1:08:46.623 --> 1:08:47.722
- [Whisper on the Torc] Dogwatch
clear.

1:08:47.723 --> 1:08:48.822
I need to kill something.

1:08:53.263 --> 1:08:54.863
- They killed the Captain,
Marko.

1:08:56.633 --> 1:08:59.400
- What in the seven hells
are you talking about?

1:08:59.402 --> 1:09:00.468
Who killed the Captain?

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:03.671
- Top and the other commanders.

1:09:03.673 --> 1:09:06.508
- [Top on the Torc] BFR, report!

1:09:06.510 --> 1:09:07.609
- Tell him we're all clear.

1:09:07.611 --> 1:09:09.611
- He mutinied us.

1:09:09.613 --> 1:09:10.879
Why?

1:09:10.881 --> 1:09:13.481
Why would he do that?

1:09:13.483 --> 1:09:14.849
Mutiny is punishable by death.

1:09:14.851 --> 1:09:17.552
Even worse, it's dishonorable.

1:09:18.722 --> 1:09:21.723
He got Wymrick and Switch killed
for--

1:09:21.725 --> 1:09:24.159
- [Top on the Torc]
Buttercup, Marko, come in.

1:09:24.161 --> 1:09:24.859
- Tell him.

1:09:27.664 --> 1:09:28.897
- BFR clear.

1:09:28.899 --> 1:09:31.666
- Think about what
you're saying, Buttercup.

1:09:31.668 --> 1:09:33.334
This is Top you're talking
about.

1:09:33.336 --> 1:09:35.670
I don't know what you
think you heard but--

1:09:35.672 --> 1:09:39.641
- I heard Top confess to
Flewellyn

1:09:39.643 --> 1:09:42.677
that he and the other
commanders killed the Captain.

1:09:42.679 --> 1:09:45.680
They thought he was crazy and
trying to get us all killed,

1:09:45.682 --> 1:09:48.483
so they killed him first.

1:09:48.485 --> 1:09:52.654
This bullshit plan to escape
to Stone's Fall, that's theirs.

1:09:52.656 --> 1:09:55.456
They are the ones who are
trying to get us killed.

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.927
- We'll talk about this later.

1:09:58.929 --> 1:10:00.278
- Overwatch, talk to me.

1:10:00.279 --> 1:10:01.628
- [Reaper on the Torc] Got
nothing here.

1:10:01.631 --> 1:10:03.631
Trees are shaking like crazy.

1:10:03.633 --> 1:10:04.666
- Whisper?

1:10:04.668 --> 1:10:05.733
- I don't see anything,

1:10:05.735 --> 1:10:08.236
but every bird in the northern
reach

1:10:08.238 --> 1:10:09.771
silhouetted against the moon.

1:10:09.773 --> 1:10:10.638
- [Top On The Torc] Night sight.

1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:11.673
- I'm already on it.

1:10:11.674 --> 1:10:12.707
[Top On The Torc] Double time,
soldier.

1:10:13.944 --> 1:10:14.842
- [Whisper On The Torc]
Tell DJ to get his ass

1:10:14.844 --> 1:10:16.611
back up here.

1:10:16.613 --> 1:10:17.445
- DJ?

1:10:17.447 --> 1:10:18.346
- On my way.

1:10:19.282 --> 1:10:20.281
- Shit!

1:10:20.283 --> 1:10:21.583
- Top, it's the Samada.

1:10:21.585 --> 1:10:22.617
- [Top On The Torc] How many
horses?

1:10:22.619 --> 1:10:24.111
- [Whisper] Too many to count.

1:10:24.112 --> 1:10:25.604
- [Top On The Torc] Anything
else?

1:10:25.605 --> 1:10:27.097
- Two dozen archers and
cavaliers

1:10:27.098 --> 1:10:28.590
just separated from the main
force coming right at us.

1:10:28.592 --> 1:10:29.524
- Fuck, who's shaking the bed?

1:10:29.525 --> 1:10:30.457
- [Reaper On The Torc] I've got
movement.

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:31.292
- What do you see?

1:10:31.294 --> 1:10:32.427
- 25 archers.

1:10:32.429 --> 1:10:33.879
They're Nosck.

1:10:33.880 --> 1:10:35.330
I thought you said they
were Samada, Whisper?

1:10:35.332 --> 1:10:37.432
- On my side of the barn, they
are.

1:10:37.434 --> 1:10:39.734
(clattering)

1:10:41.404 --> 1:10:42.670
- [Buttercup] Cover!

1:10:42.672 --> 1:10:45.940
(DJ and Marko grunting)

1:10:45.942 --> 1:10:47.408
(horse neighs)

1:10:47.410 --> 1:10:48.710
- [DJ] Seven hells.

1:10:48.712 --> 1:10:50.778
- Shit.
- That was close.

1:10:51.781 --> 1:10:53.581
(both grunting)

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:54.682
- [Marko] Shit.

1:10:54.684 --> 1:10:57.418
(Buttercup grunts)

1:10:57.420 --> 1:10:58.253
- Too close.

1:10:59.489 --> 1:11:02.490
- Kaylee, we need you!

1:11:02.492 --> 1:11:03.858
It's DJ.

1:11:03.860 --> 1:11:05.627
(Kaylee screams)

1:11:05.629 --> 1:11:06.928
- She's coming.

1:11:08.331 --> 1:11:11.266
- Slab, you and Flewellyn
secure the Chopshop.

1:11:13.536 --> 1:11:14.636
- Don't hold back, old man.

1:11:14.637 --> 1:11:15.737
When it comes to it, you unleash
hell.

1:11:17.707 --> 1:11:20.675
(Hobnail chanting)

1:11:20.677 --> 1:11:22.677
- Have you got anything left?

1:11:22.678 --> 1:11:24.678
- Not much, and this is gonna
hurt.

1:11:24.681 --> 1:11:27.282
(DJ grunts)

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:31.653
(DJ groans)

1:11:31.655 --> 1:11:33.288
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:11:33.290 --> 1:11:35.523
- [Buttercup] Kaylee!

1:11:35.525 --> 1:11:38.793
- Where is it?
(Kaylee panting)

1:11:38.795 --> 1:11:40.762
Slab, you stupid bastard,

1:11:40.763 --> 1:11:42.730
I'm gonna kill you for wasting
it.

1:11:42.732 --> 1:11:44.999
- How do you like that,
you ugly pieces of shit?

1:11:45.001 --> 1:11:47.635
- [Reaper On The Torc] I need
backup.

1:11:48.872 --> 1:11:51.306
- You're so beautiful.

1:11:51.308 --> 1:11:53.708
- You can't die on me, DJ.

1:11:53.710 --> 1:11:55.677
I won't let you (sobs).

1:11:55.679 --> 1:11:56.778
You're mine.

1:11:56.779 --> 1:11:57.878
- Summon the Water Queen,
Kaylee.

1:11:58.948 --> 1:12:00.682
(Kaylee crying)
(DJ grunting)

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:01.783
- [Kaylee] Don't do it or I
swear

1:12:01.785 --> 1:12:03.751
on my god's mark, I'll follow
you.

1:12:03.753 --> 1:12:05.053
- [Marko] Summon her.

1:12:06.823 --> 1:12:09.691
(dogs barking)

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:14.095
(Kaylee breathes heavily)

1:12:14.931 --> 1:12:18.866
(whispers holy incantation)

1:12:33.817 --> 1:12:36.951
(magic sparkles)

1:12:36.953 --> 1:12:39.754
(Kaylee panting)

1:12:41.358 --> 1:12:42.056
- No.

1:12:44.861 --> 1:12:46.561
No (sobbing).

1:12:46.563 --> 1:12:51.632
(arrows firing)
(crowd revolting)

1:12:51.634 --> 1:12:54.569
(crowd howling)

1:12:57.974 --> 1:12:59.674
- One, two, three!

1:13:00.877 --> 1:13:03.511
(arrow firing)

1:13:06.015 --> 1:13:06.914
(explodes)

1:13:06.916 --> 1:13:10.418
(creatures whimper)

1:13:10.420 --> 1:13:12.153
(Hobnail chanting in foreign
language)

1:13:12.155 --> 1:13:14.922
- Buttercup, you're with
Whisper.

1:13:14.924 --> 1:13:17.925
(Kaylee crying)

1:13:17.927 --> 1:13:19.060
- Stay with me, dammit!

1:13:19.062 --> 1:13:21.462
This isn't optional.

1:13:21.464 --> 1:13:22.764
Get on your feet.

1:13:22.766 --> 1:13:24.799
You can't take the easy way out
this time.

1:13:24.801 --> 1:13:28.403
Do you hear me (cries)?

1:13:29.672 --> 1:13:31.806
- I'll do it, Switch.

1:13:35.845 --> 1:13:38.679
(Slab screaming)

1:13:41.885 --> 1:13:43.785
- What the hell was that?

1:13:43.787 --> 1:13:45.453
- Hell unleashed.

1:13:46.923 --> 1:13:48.689
- Hurry up, Hob!

1:13:48.691 --> 1:13:53.795
(Hobnail chanting in foreign
language)

1:13:53.797 --> 1:13:56.631
(arrow firing)

1:13:58.668 --> 1:14:02.203
(Reaper breathing heavily)

1:14:05.542 --> 1:14:06.607
- I'm out of arrows.

1:14:08.878 --> 1:14:11.179
Make sure the Warlords of the
Sword Halls

1:14:11.181 --> 1:14:12.547
know I fought well.

1:14:22.725 --> 1:14:24.759
(Reaper grunts)

1:14:24.761 --> 1:14:27.495
(arrows firing)

1:14:29.065 --> 1:14:30.198
- (gasping) Pull them out.

1:14:30.200 --> 1:14:32.233
I'm not done killing these
bastards.

1:14:33.803 --> 1:14:35.169
(horse neighs)

1:14:35.171 --> 1:14:38.005
(dogs barking)

1:14:43.980 --> 1:14:46.747
(arrows firing)

1:14:48.818 --> 1:14:50.251
(fire blazing)

1:14:50.253 --> 1:14:52.253
- Come on, motherfuckers.

1:14:52.255 --> 1:14:54.155
Come after me, you piece of
shit.

1:14:55.625 --> 1:14:56.791
(faint voice talking)

1:14:56.793 --> 1:14:59.060
(fire explodes)

1:14:59.062 --> 1:15:01.696
- (gasping) Was that,

1:15:01.698 --> 1:15:03.498
was that us or them?

1:15:03.500 --> 1:15:04.165
- It was me.

1:15:05.235 --> 1:15:07.502
- (whimpers) It's okay.

1:15:07.504 --> 1:15:08.135
It's okay.

1:15:08.137 --> 1:15:09.837
- I need to meditate.

1:15:15.512 --> 1:15:17.712
(Top pukes)

1:15:18.648 --> 1:15:20.715
- [Slab] Top, are you okay?

1:15:20.717 --> 1:15:22.016
- [Top] I'm okay.

1:15:22.018 --> 1:15:22.917
Okay.

1:15:25.021 --> 1:15:26.087
Hob?
- She'll be fine

1:15:26.089 --> 1:15:27.589
with some rest.

1:15:27.590 --> 1:15:29.090
- [Top] Something we
don't have the luxury of.

1:15:33.162 --> 1:15:34.795
All swords, report.

1:15:43.840 --> 1:15:45.172
- Buttercup left, Top.

1:15:46.843 --> 1:15:48.075
What did you do to her?

1:15:51.114 --> 1:15:52.847
Top?

1:15:52.848 --> 1:15:54.581
- [Top On The Torc] All
swords, regroup in Abbey.

1:15:54.584 --> 1:15:56.817
- Yeah, about that.

1:15:58.821 --> 1:16:01.322
(Marko grunts)

1:16:04.994 --> 1:16:05.893
- Kaylee.

1:16:11.134 --> 1:16:13.701
(Kaylee sobs)

1:16:18.608 --> 1:16:19.907
I know about the Captain.

1:16:28.851 --> 1:16:30.251
- Ghostwatch is alive.

1:16:35.959 --> 1:16:36.857
- [Top] Get up.

1:16:38.194 --> 1:16:40.261
How far away did you send them?

1:16:40.263 --> 1:16:44.332
- (coughs) One, maybe two
leagues.

1:16:44.334 --> 1:16:46.284
(everyone groans)

1:16:46.285 --> 1:16:48.235
- Not far enough, especially
for the ones on horseback.

1:16:48.237 --> 1:16:50.671
- [Hob] I jumped them as far as
I could.

1:16:50.673 --> 1:16:52.773
We're still gonna die.

1:16:52.775 --> 1:16:54.141
- [Top] Kaylee, can you--

1:16:54.143 --> 1:16:55.376
- Wymrick died.

1:16:55.378 --> 1:16:56.310
Switch died.

1:16:56.312 --> 1:16:58.312
DJ is dead.

1:16:58.314 --> 1:17:00.081
- I know--
- No one else.

1:17:00.083 --> 1:17:01.282
Not now, not again.

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:03.684
Hob can wait until I'm done with
Whisper.

1:17:03.686 --> 1:17:05.152
- Let's go kill something.

1:17:05.154 --> 1:17:06.687
- Top?

1:17:06.689 --> 1:17:09.023
Buttercup overheard you and
Flewellyn.

1:17:09.025 --> 1:17:10.091
She heard everything.

1:17:10.093 --> 1:17:12.226
- Not now, Marko.

1:17:12.228 --> 1:17:14.028
- [Reaper] Those troops are
probably on their way back.

1:17:14.030 --> 1:17:14.996
We need to go.

1:17:14.997 --> 1:17:15.963
- [Flewellyn] I don't
know what you heard, son,

1:17:15.964 --> 1:17:16.930
but it's not what you think--

1:17:16.933 --> 1:17:18.333
- No, no, no, no.

1:17:18.334 --> 1:17:19.734
Not after all the hell
we went through tonight,

1:17:19.736 --> 1:17:22.403
don't you dare disrespect us,

1:17:22.405 --> 1:17:26.340
especially Wymrick, Switch,
and DJ with bullshit.

1:17:26.342 --> 1:17:27.775
- Careful, Marko.

1:17:27.777 --> 1:17:29.710
I'll put you out of your
misery like you asked.

1:17:29.712 --> 1:17:31.779
- [Flewellyn] What did Buttercup
tell you?

1:17:31.781 --> 1:17:33.381
- You're the one Top confided
in.

1:17:33.383 --> 1:17:34.415
You tell us.

1:17:34.417 --> 1:17:36.283
- Stand down, all of you.

1:17:36.285 --> 1:17:38.119
You are good soldiers,

1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:39.954
but if you are gonna turn
on anyone, you turn on me

1:17:39.956 --> 1:17:41.255
and me alone.

1:17:41.257 --> 1:17:42.957
- Did you kill the Captain?

1:17:49.999 --> 1:17:51.065
- No.

1:17:51.067 --> 1:17:53.901
No, no, no, no.

1:17:53.903 --> 1:17:54.802
No!

1:17:56.172 --> 1:17:57.071
- Yes.

1:17:58.708 --> 1:17:59.974
- What?

1:17:59.976 --> 1:18:00.875
- Oh, Top.

1:18:02.245 --> 1:18:03.144
- Why?

1:18:04.847 --> 1:18:05.746
- I can,

1:18:05.748 --> 1:18:11.352
I will explain, but we need
to get to safety first.

1:18:11.354 --> 1:18:12.420
We can do a reckoning then--

1:18:12.422 --> 1:18:13.387
- You broke us.

1:18:13.389 --> 1:18:14.355
You broke the Swords!

1:18:14.357 --> 1:18:16.390
- He was unstable at the end.

1:18:16.392 --> 1:18:19.360
If we had followed
orders, we would be dead.

1:18:19.362 --> 1:18:20.995
- [Kaylee] Whisper!

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:27.068
- DJ was my friend.

1:18:28.471 --> 1:18:32.873
If he died in vain, I will
spend whatever time I have left

1:18:32.875 --> 1:18:34.208
killing you slowly.

1:18:34.210 --> 1:18:35.743
Do you understand me?

1:18:36.879 --> 1:18:38.179
- I understand.

1:18:38.181 --> 1:18:41.782
On my god's mark, Whisper,
he did not die in vain.

1:18:45.488 --> 1:18:46.754
- I trust him.

1:18:48.424 --> 1:18:49.457
- And that's supposed to be good
enough?

1:18:49.459 --> 1:18:51.358
- He's right, Whisper, it's not.

1:18:52.295 --> 1:18:53.427
The Swords are my family.

1:18:53.429 --> 1:18:55.429
If he killed the Captain--

1:18:55.430 --> 1:18:57.430
- If he killed the Captain,
he had a good reason.

1:18:57.433 --> 1:18:58.966
- And what reason would that be?

1:18:58.968 --> 1:19:01.469
- You need to focus on duty.

1:19:01.471 --> 1:19:03.003
Listen to orders, think later.

1:19:03.005 --> 1:19:04.205
- Shut up, old man.

1:19:04.207 --> 1:19:08.409
Marko, Top has never done bad by
us, ever.

1:19:08.411 --> 1:19:10.878
We owe him the benefit of the
doubt.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:11.512
- Do we?

1:19:11.514 --> 1:19:13.748
- New guy's gonna die.

1:19:13.750 --> 1:19:16.784
- I am not fucking new!

1:19:20.056 --> 1:19:23.424
Every master I had promised me
my freedom.

1:19:25.361 --> 1:19:29.396
Promised that if I
listened, I could walk free.

1:19:33.803 --> 1:19:37.471
And we all know how well that
went, huh?

1:19:40.042 --> 1:19:42.243
- When we joined the swords,

1:19:42.245 --> 1:19:45.513
that was all forgotten and put
behind us.

1:19:47.917 --> 1:19:49.817
We should listen to Top.

1:19:50.787 --> 1:19:53.220
(ominous music)

1:19:53.222 --> 1:19:56.123
(creature growls)

1:19:58.561 --> 1:19:59.493
- [Slab] Oh, shit.

1:20:01.864 --> 1:20:03.097
- I need food.

1:20:03.933 --> 1:20:05.933
(ominous music)

1:20:05.935 --> 1:20:08.469
(weapons clang)

1:20:16.512 --> 1:20:17.812
- Judge?

1:20:19.515 --> 1:20:21.515
- (spits) Slake.

1:20:25.021 --> 1:20:27.855
Three Samada scouts
captured your shield-maiden.

1:20:28.958 --> 1:20:32.326
I couldn't get to her in time,
I'm sorry.

1:20:37.867 --> 1:20:38.899
It was their final act.

1:20:50.580 --> 1:20:53.080
Do you have the Captain's hutch?

1:20:53.082 --> 1:20:54.348
- He wasn't wearing one.

1:20:55.451 --> 1:20:56.517
- Buttercup had it.

1:20:58.287 --> 1:21:01.288
The Captain gave her his
last will and testament.

1:21:01.290 --> 1:21:04.124
She meant to fulfill it,
whatever it was.

1:21:11.868 --> 1:21:13.868
- We don't have time for this.

1:21:13.870 --> 1:21:14.935
If you're here to kill me, kill
me.

1:21:14.937 --> 1:21:15.936
- No!

1:21:15.938 --> 1:21:18.606
(sword clangs)

1:21:20.176 --> 1:21:21.375
- You've changed.

1:21:27.383 --> 1:21:30.017
A caul of mortality
clouds your vision now.

1:21:34.557 --> 1:21:36.423
Be certain, Reaper.

1:21:36.425 --> 1:21:39.927
There will be no second chance.

1:21:39.929 --> 1:21:42.897
(Flewellyn grunts)

1:21:49.272 --> 1:21:52.339
(Flewellyn panting)

1:21:56.112 --> 1:21:58.679
Isn't it about time you
stepped out of his shadow?

1:22:03.920 --> 1:22:07.688
It's not surprising any of this.

1:22:11.127 --> 1:22:13.694
(door slides)

1:22:15.598 --> 1:22:19.266
(sighs) This land, it's dark.

1:22:21.470 --> 1:22:22.703
A dark place.

1:22:25.641 --> 1:22:27.107
Soldiers turn,

1:22:30.146 --> 1:22:32.413
words and bonds get broken.

1:22:35.184 --> 1:22:36.583
Feels like the Pit again

1:22:40.056 --> 1:22:44.725
and that black-damned
soul-wizard Cerak.

1:22:45.661 --> 1:22:46.593
- I knew it.

1:22:48.164 --> 1:22:49.296
- Hob remembers.

1:22:56.505 --> 1:22:59.440
Slake should, even though
he was a new recruit.

1:23:01.477 --> 1:23:05.346
The first soldiers taken,
we found nailed to trees.

1:23:07.984 --> 1:23:12.019
The wounds on the bodies were
odd.

1:23:13.322 --> 1:23:15.689
Straight lines down each limb.

1:23:18.094 --> 1:23:19.626
A clean cut down the torso.

1:23:22.264 --> 1:23:27.334
Their flesh hung from the
nails like used clothes.

1:23:29.605 --> 1:23:31.372
Their bones were gone.

1:23:32.408 --> 1:23:33.273
- Gods.

1:23:39.782 --> 1:23:43.550
- No, it wasn't the gods.

1:23:45.021 --> 1:23:46.286
It was much worse.

1:23:49.525 --> 1:23:50.758
I heard it first.

1:23:52.328 --> 1:23:56.663
A clicking that made my ears
itch.

1:23:59.168 --> 1:24:00.768
What came over that ridge-line,

1:24:04.707 --> 1:24:09.743
the clicking was the sound
of bones, hundreds of bones

1:24:11.580 --> 1:24:16.650
that were fused together in
some sort of sick twisted

1:24:20.389 --> 1:24:23.357
thing that looked like a,

1:24:28.130 --> 1:24:33.067
their bones were used by
that godsdamned wizard

1:24:33.069 --> 1:24:36.070
for this monstrosity.

1:24:37.606 --> 1:24:42.643
We ran as fast and as far as we
could,

1:24:43.813 --> 1:24:44.711
then we waited.

1:24:47.817 --> 1:24:48.782
Waited for daylight.

1:24:51.654 --> 1:24:52.619
Three days.

1:24:53.823 --> 1:24:55.389
Our supplies were gone.

1:24:56.559 --> 1:24:59.126
Anyone who was slightly injured
died

1:24:59.128 --> 1:25:01.395
of the blight that infected the
forest.

1:25:03.265 --> 1:25:07.534
Three days and the healers
finally figured out

1:25:07.536 --> 1:25:11.572
that chewing Arvanda root
would seal our wounds

1:25:15.344 --> 1:25:17.644
and keep the infection from
getting in.

1:25:18.881 --> 1:25:22.449
The Captain had us focus on a
simple task.

1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:25.152
Dig in.

1:25:27.256 --> 1:25:28.822
Dig in and hold.

1:25:32.828 --> 1:25:34.661
He and Deegan left us there.

1:25:36.732 --> 1:25:41.768
Only later did we realize
what he did when he went back.

1:25:44.373 --> 1:25:45.906
We never saw Deegan again.

1:25:50.446 --> 1:25:54.648
Those last few hours were the
worst part.

1:25:58.387 --> 1:26:01.922
That waiting and the not knowing

1:26:04.193 --> 1:26:06.393
I'll never eat Arvanda root
again.

1:26:09.765 --> 1:26:12.432
But we killed that bastard
Cerak.

1:26:14.937 --> 1:26:16.503
Tore out his soul

1:26:18.774 --> 1:26:21.675
and sent it to oblivion.

1:26:34.456 --> 1:26:36.657
- I don't know if it was
one of the lich's minions

1:26:36.659 --> 1:26:40.827
or the Captain unwittingly
brought a piece of the tomb

1:26:40.829 --> 1:26:45.632
out with him or maybe
intentionally, but I--

1:26:45.634 --> 1:26:48.569
- The Captain would have killed
the entire company today.

1:26:50.539 --> 1:26:51.505
You were right,

1:26:52.908 --> 1:26:54.641
but you need to be reminded.

1:26:56.312 --> 1:26:58.545
You need to remember the price
he paid

1:26:58.547 --> 1:27:01.348
so that we could all
escape that black hell.

1:27:02.618 --> 1:27:03.450
- Valara, I--

1:27:03.452 --> 1:27:04.585
- Did he die swiftly?

1:27:05.454 --> 1:27:06.820
- He died with honor.

1:27:08.390 --> 1:27:10.357
The unit commanders were
witnesses.

1:27:32.548 --> 1:27:37.484
- And if I were here to kill
any of you, you'd be dead.

1:27:45.427 --> 1:27:47.861
(door sliding)

1:27:52.668 --> 1:27:55.435
(Top sighs deeply)

1:27:55.437 --> 1:27:57.271
- I remembered now.

1:27:59.308 --> 1:28:01.975
(dramatic music)

1:28:03.679 --> 1:28:04.911
- So, how the hell are we gonna
get out

1:28:04.913 --> 1:28:06.780
of this fuckin' shit heap?

1:28:06.782 --> 1:28:09.483
(dramatic music)

1:28:09.485 --> 1:28:12.486
- Slab, they're all yours.

1:28:13.722 --> 1:28:15.672
- Top, are you sure it's a good
idea--

1:28:15.673 --> 1:28:17.623
- My responsibility is all
the remaining Swords now.

1:28:18.727 --> 1:28:19.626
He's ready.

1:28:23.599 --> 1:28:25.899
- All right, assholes
and elbows everybody.

1:28:25.901 --> 1:28:26.733
Pack it up.

1:28:26.735 --> 1:28:28.535
Let's get ready to move.

1:28:28.537 --> 1:28:31.738
(metal gears clanging)

1:28:37.413 --> 1:28:39.680
(dramatic music)

1:28:39.682 --> 1:28:40.881
SitRep.

1:28:40.883 --> 1:28:43.650
- [Reaper] Two minutes, coming
in hot.

1:28:43.652 --> 1:28:45.552
They're lighting up their
skybows.

1:28:45.554 --> 1:28:47.354
- [Slab] Hobnail, Kaylee,
you're in the middle.

1:28:47.356 --> 1:28:48.589
Whisper--

1:28:48.590 --> 1:28:49.823
- Fuck you, I can help myself.

1:28:50.793 --> 1:28:51.692
- Reaper, new guy?

1:28:51.694 --> 1:28:53.493
- No.

1:28:53.495 --> 1:28:54.394
New guy no more.

1:28:55.431 --> 1:28:57.030
His name is Scar.

1:28:57.032 --> 1:29:00.567
- Well isn't that just fucking
great?

1:29:00.569 --> 1:29:01.635
- Top, you and Flewellyn are--

1:29:01.637 --> 1:29:02.769
- Not me.

1:29:02.771 --> 1:29:03.670
- [Top] Old man.

1:29:03.672 --> 1:29:07.407
- I've decided to take
that promotion after all.

1:29:07.409 --> 1:29:09.710
- We're all getting out
of this, or none of us.

1:29:09.712 --> 1:29:10.677
- [Marko] One minute.

1:29:10.679 --> 1:29:11.978
- I'm tired, Slake.

1:29:12.781 --> 1:29:14.548
I need to go home.

1:29:14.550 --> 1:29:17.351
I can buy you all time.

1:29:17.353 --> 1:29:18.552
You'll need a distraction.

1:29:18.554 --> 1:29:19.619
- But DJ's body--

1:29:19.621 --> 1:29:21.655
- Is no longer your domain,
Kaylee.

1:29:23.425 --> 1:29:24.791
Just see his hutch delivered.

1:29:24.793 --> 1:29:27.994
I can certainly take
care of his body for you.

1:29:30.399 --> 1:29:32.999
(dramatic music)

1:29:40.609 --> 1:29:42.576
- This might help a little, you
old goat.

1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:47.481
(dramatic music)

1:29:55.724 --> 1:29:56.823
- Take care, old friend.

1:29:59.094 --> 1:30:00.394
- Godspeed, brother.

1:30:01.697 --> 1:30:04.698
(wolves howling)

1:30:06.568 --> 1:30:09.569
(Top sighs deeply)

1:30:09.571 --> 1:30:11.605
- You're the best troops I've
ever led.

1:30:12.741 --> 1:30:14.408
You have never failed me.

1:30:14.410 --> 1:30:18.812
You will not fail now, do you
understand?

1:30:20.582 --> 1:30:22.749
We will get to Stone's Fall

1:30:22.751 --> 1:30:25.519
and we will kill every asshole
in our way

1:30:25.521 --> 1:30:29.623
and every single one of
us will raise a toast

1:30:29.625 --> 1:30:33.660
to our fallen with mugs
of ale in Wayanmar!

1:30:34.863 --> 1:30:37.431
(all cheer)

1:30:38.500 --> 1:30:41.134
(Top breathing heavily)

1:30:41.136 --> 1:30:42.702
- [Slab] Let's go!

1:30:43.705 --> 1:30:46.706
(dramatic music)

1:31:10.999 --> 1:31:13.733
(intense music)

1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:34.087
("Apex")

1:31:54.943 --> 1:31:59.746
¶ Hello mountain, remember me ¶

1:31:59.748 --> 1:32:03.750
¶ Child of your womb ¶

1:32:03.752 --> 1:32:05.786
¶ I return ¶

1:32:05.787 --> 1:32:07.821
¶ From a perilous place ¶
(wolves howling)

1:32:07.823 --> 1:32:09.723
- We don't speak often, Father,

1:32:11.693 --> 1:32:13.026
but thank you for this life.

1:32:14.563 --> 1:32:17.564
My honor is your honor.

1:32:17.566 --> 1:32:19.199
(wolves howling)

1:32:19.201 --> 1:32:23.703
And if you deem me worthy,
grant one last gift

1:32:23.705 --> 1:32:26.873
to face whatever is on the
other side of those doors.

1:32:26.875 --> 1:32:28.842
(thudding on the door)

1:32:28.844 --> 1:32:31.912
Oh, (laughs) and apologize
to the Madzi Witch for me.

1:32:33.248 --> 1:32:35.949
We all know Kaylee was
never destined to be hers.

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:41.821
(crowd revolting)

1:32:43.859 --> 1:32:44.758
Now, assholes,

1:32:47.563 --> 1:32:49.863
how about we unleash hell one
last time?

1:32:51.733 --> 1:32:56.136
¶ As your power, it sinks into
me ¶

1:32:56.138 --> 1:33:00.774
¶ Your roots take their hold
¶

1:33:00.776 --> 1:33:05.145
¶ My body as one with the
earth ¶

1:33:05.147 --> 1:33:10.216
¶ My blood as the stone ¶

1:33:10.218 --> 1:33:12.819
¶ The mountain, my home ¶

1:33:12.821 --> 1:33:14.788
¶ Home ¶

1:33:19.261 --> 1:33:22.696
(intense metal music)

1:33:41.183 --> 1:33:43.316
¶ Heavy walls enclose me ¶

1:33:43.318 --> 1:33:47.921
¶ Cover me in endless warmth
¶

1:33:47.923 --> 1:33:50.890
¶ And now the dreams will come
¶

1:33:50.892 --> 1:33:54.260
¶ Lucid freedom takes me ¶

1:33:54.262 --> 1:33:59.332
¶ To a world no longer run
by the laws of relativity ¶

1:34:01.169 --> 1:34:06.239
¶ Fly out beyond the stars ¶

1:34:09.177 --> 1:34:13.980
¶ Where the wind takes me away
¶

1:34:13.982 --> 1:34:18.852
¶ And leads me through the
dark ¶

1:34:19.955 --> 1:34:22.822
¶ Defying gravity ¶

1:34:22.824 --> 1:34:27.894
¶ Can you follow me? ¶

1:34:27.896 --> 1:34:33.033
¶ Follow me to apex ¶

1:34:33.035 --> 1:34:38.104
¶ Can you follow me? ¶

1:34:38.106 --> 1:34:43.777
¶ Follow me to apex ¶

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:47.881
¶ Through a meadow running ¶

1:34:47.883 --> 1:34:51.985
¶ Feel the sun upon my face
¶

1:34:51.987 --> 1:34:55.055
¶ And the air intoxicates ¶

1:34:55.057 --> 1:34:58.458
¶ Rushing like a river ¶

1:34:58.460 --> 1:35:03.797
¶ Toward a waterfall that
takes me out beyond reality ¶

1:35:05.167 --> 1:35:10.236
¶ Away, you lead me through
the dark ¶

1:35:13.208 --> 1:35:16.076
¶ Defying gravity ¶

1:35:16.078 --> 1:35:20.947
¶ Can you follow me? ¶

1:35:20.949 --> 1:35:26.019
¶ Follow me to apex ¶

1:35:26.021 --> 1:35:31.458
¶ Can you follow me? ¶

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:35.061
¶ Follow me to apex ¶

1:35:36.965 --> 1:35:40.233
(intense metal music)

1:37:41.189 --> 1:37:45.291
¶ Can you follow me? ¶

1:37:45.293 --> 1:37:50.363
¶ Follow me to apex ¶

1:37:50.365 --> 1:37:53.867
¶ Can you follow ¶
