<i>My brother was murdered here.</i>

00:19.853 --> 00:21.438
<i>It was Ezequiel.</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.545
[man]
I called you here to give you something.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.048
It's just a little precaution.

00:53.178 --> 00:58.058
If you get caught, take this poison
so you can't rat anyone out.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.479
Use it only as a last resort.

01:07.150 --> 01:11.154

02:50.796 --> 02:53.215
Hi, Michele. Welcome.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.676
-Hi.
-[Luciana] Make yourself at home.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.721
Today, you can relax. We know
the Process can be quite stressful.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.849
Yeah. But I'm relaxed.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.434
[laughing]

03:04.518 --> 03:07.145
-Doesn't look like it.
-[Luciana] What?

03:07.854 --> 03:10.273
-Don't listen to him.
-[all chuckle]

03:12.067 --> 03:14.361

[Fernando, voice distant]
Michele?

03:40.804 --> 03:41.847
Michele?

03:42.681 --> 03:45.809
-You took so long. I need to talk to you.
-Hi, Fernando.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.853
Can we talk later?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.521
But it's very important.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.233
I'm gonna grab a drink. We'll talk later.

03:53.316 --> 03:55.819
-But, Michele, I need to talk to you now.
-I can't now.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.349
-Good evening, Ezequiel.
-[Ezequiel] Good evening.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.059
Would you like some?

04:38.653 --> 04:39.488
To us.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.337
[man] I admire you.
I'm happy to have made it through.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.130
[Ezequiel] Congratulations. Enjoy.

04:58.381 --> 04:59.216
[man] Thank you.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.928
Hello.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.474
Congratulations on another year, Mathias.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.644
[low chatter]

05:43.635 --> 05:45.345
Congratulations on the Process.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.721
I didn't do much.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.016
You should thank the other agents.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.309
Come on...

05:52.477 --> 05:53.645
You...

05:56.231 --> 05:57.399
You deserve it.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.536
[Jairo] We create many varieties there
not available in the Inland.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.371
[Joana]
The food is good, isn't it?

06:12.914 --> 06:15.750
[Rafael] But the question everyone's
asking is: "What about dinner?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.586
Is it gonna happen tonight?
Are you sure?"

06:17.669 --> 06:18.503
[chuckles]

06:22.757 --> 06:24.175
Hello, how are you?

06:25.677 --> 06:29.097
-You really are an idiot.
-What?

06:38.940 --> 06:42.569
Changing the subject...
what is sex like on the Offshore?

06:43.361 --> 06:45.155
What do you mean? Sex is sex.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.365
I know, but do you get married,

06:47.449 --> 06:49.784
stay with just one person,
or is it more liberal?

06:49.868 --> 06:51.369
[Jairo chuckles]

06:52.454 --> 06:54.289
You'll find out soon enough, Joana.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.542
Can't you give us a hint?
So I know what to expect.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.046
[Rafael] Well, I think I'm gonna go now.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.506
[Jairo] No, stay right there.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.592
Hey, Michele, what do you think?

07:06.301 --> 07:07.510
-About what?
-Michele...

07:07.594 --> 07:09.054
[all chuckling]

07:09.763 --> 07:11.014
[Rafael] She's not listening.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.850
-[loud clinking]
-[woman] Attention!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.268
[Ezequiel] Good evening.

07:15.810 --> 07:20.523
I'd like to ask my dear candidates
to come a little closer.

07:22.651 --> 07:27.614
The dinner we are about to serve
is a celebration feast.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.532
[crowd cheers]

07:29.616 --> 07:34.120
Now, you can consider yourselves
actual people.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.247
The chosen three percent!

07:36.331 --> 07:37.707
[loud cheering]

07:39.751 --> 07:40.752
[woman] Congrats!

07:40.835 --> 07:41.962
[man] Fuck, yeah!

07:42.295 --> 07:46.591
This year, like all others, wasn't easy.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.303
But I'll remember it forever.

07:51.805 --> 07:55.558
Tomorrow, you will go through
the Purification ritual...

07:56.184 --> 07:58.353
and then you can head to the Offshore.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.732
Well, I'm sure you can't wait for me
to stop talking,

08:02.816 --> 08:04.943
-so I'll stop talking.
-[laughter]

08:05.568 --> 08:09.698
So, let us toast
and celebrate the three percent!

08:09.781 --> 08:11.992
[cheering]

08:19.040 --> 08:21.835
-[glass shatters]
-[Luciana] César? What's happening?

08:21.918 --> 08:23.044
César! César!

08:23.128 --> 08:26.131
-Don't touch him!
-What's going on? What is it?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.216
[distant chatter]

08:29.134 --> 08:30.260
[Ezequiel] Quickly!

08:33.138 --> 08:35.347
[Luciana]
For God's sake, what's happening?

08:40.687 --> 08:42.688
[Jairo]
Stay here until further notice.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.026
César may have felt sick,
but Dr. Gisele will take good care of him.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.694
[paddles charge, surging]

08:47.777 --> 08:49.446
Did he have any health problems?

08:49.529 --> 08:54.117
No. His exams were good.
He was in excellent health.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.452
Is this a normal occurrence?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.412
Of course not. "Normal"?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.539
[heart monitor beeping]

09:03.334 --> 09:05.295
[beeping rapidly]

09:28.401 --> 09:29.444
[EKG flatlining]

09:33.740 --> 09:35.492
[gasping breaths]

09:45.919 --> 09:48.755
-[low chatter]
-[Rafael] Michele, stop right there.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.091
I saw what you did.

09:56.971 --> 10:00.642
You spilled booze all over the table.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.728
This liquor is a rarity.

10:04.521 --> 10:05.814
What a waste.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.525
I saw everything.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.402
But relax.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.489
These bottles are really hard to open.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.033
I tried to pour a drink
and made a mess, too.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.786
Guys, this booze is strong.
Rafael's already drunk.

10:19.869 --> 10:20.703
[Rafael] Maybe I am.

10:20.787 --> 10:25.250
But it's at times like these
that I remember my training.

10:27.043 --> 10:32.173
I trained with an uncle who drank so much.
He drank and drank and drank.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.091
But...

10:34.384 --> 10:35.260
he never fell down.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.679
That's the important thing, Michele.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.389
To never fall down.

10:40.265 --> 10:41.349
Huh?

10:41.432 --> 10:43.935
-Another glass, and you'll keel over.
-Check it out.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.271
-Huh? Huh?
-[all chuckling]

10:46.354 --> 10:48.690
-Take it easy.
-Before I forget...

10:49.149 --> 10:51.818
What are you gonna do? It's over, anyway.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.612
-Fernando knows about us.
-[Joana] Mm...

10:59.284 --> 11:00.326
What?

11:00.869 --> 11:05.039
Don't worry. Process romances don't last
on the Offshore. Everybody knows.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.250
-Right.
-You've said so.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.501
Not true, Daniel.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.754
He... knows about our bond.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.424
I had to tell him.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.843
So, you should talk to him. Poor guy.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.888
I don't want him to be against us.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.306
Against you.

11:29.898 --> 11:30.982
Cheers.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.817
This wasn't a stroke.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.111
I ran a blood test...

11:36.362 --> 11:38.281
and it tested positive for batrachotoxin.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.783
-What?
-What? What do you mean?

11:42.368 --> 11:44.287
Why would anyone want to poison César?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.206
What if he wasn't the target?

11:49.292 --> 11:51.794
The hall doesn't have as many cameras
as I'd like.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.421
-What? That's absurd.
-It doesn't!

11:53.504 --> 11:58.218
Ezequiel. I checked, and the substance
is the same one the Cause uses.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.012
-Are you sure?
-We don't have it on the Offshore.

12:01.095 --> 12:04.098
-Someone from the Cause is here?
-Is the prisoner from the Cause conscious?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.224
Yes.

12:05.350 --> 12:07.310
-See if he says anything.
-Okay.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.520
-Shit!
-How did this poison get here?

12:09.604 --> 12:11.564
How are you still holding someone
from the Cause?

12:11.648 --> 12:13.024
Aline, César is dead.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.193
I need to work. I need to be alone.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.111
-Okay?
-Okay.

12:17.403 --> 12:21.366
Go ahead and work,
but work really hard to fix this shit,

12:21.449 --> 12:23.701
because if this ruins your reputation,

12:23.785 --> 12:25.703
your recommendation
will count for nothing.

12:26.287 --> 12:27.664
-Get to it.
-Go.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.291
[whispers] Shit.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.601
-I'm impressed this thing lasted so long.
-Yeah.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.770
My dad had to fix it almost every day.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.939
We have much better options
on the Offshore.

12:53.022 --> 12:56.693
And depending on the treatment,
you might not even need it.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.695
Bernardo, I need to...

12:59.904 --> 13:02.073
-May I?
-Sure. Go for it.

13:02.657 --> 13:05.159
There are many other candidates...

13:05.743 --> 13:06.869
I want to talk to.

13:09.288 --> 13:11.958
-How about now?
-What do you mean?

13:12.542 --> 13:13.501
Can we talk?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.463
Is everything okay?

13:20.008 --> 13:21.926
-Rafael--
-I know. I know.

13:22.677 --> 13:25.305
He told me this afternoon.
You are both with--

13:25.388 --> 13:27.056
Shh! Fernando, shut up.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.852
[softly] Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.481
You don't know what you're getting into.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.281
I've thought about it all day.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.242
I don't care anymore.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.786
[sighs]

13:48.870 --> 13:50.663
I don't care about anything anymore.

13:50.747 --> 13:53.291
I don't care about the Process,
about the Offshore.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.793
I don't have a home.
I have nothing left, Michele.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.921
-Fernando, you don't know me--
-You're all I have.

14:03.301 --> 14:04.719
It sounds ridiculous, I know.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.474
I'm not...
I'm not asking for anything in return.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.768
You don't have to say anything.
Just listen.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.439
You have no idea what's going on.

14:17.690 --> 14:18.983
You don't know.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.101
Unfortunately, no.

-Most likely some bastard from the Cause,

14:57.480 --> 15:01.692
but don't worry,
I know how to handle this.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.444
But I'm going to need your help.

15:03.528 --> 15:05.738
I'll check in with you later, okay?

15:40.648 --> 15:41.858
[whispers] Come with me.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.158
Hold my hand.

15:51.325 --> 15:52.910
Get rid of this for me.

15:54.662 --> 15:55.621
Why me?

15:57.290 --> 15:59.917
They're watching. I'd fuck it all up.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.519

16:33.534 --> 16:35.995

head to that ramp.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.166
What's going on?

16:40.249 --> 16:42.502
Candidate Daniel, you're first.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.518
[Matheus] <i>Unbelievable.</i>
<i>The Process is crumbling before our eyes.</i>

16:58.601 --> 17:01.979

17:02.063 --> 17:04.732
Yes, but he will be able to handle this.

-<i>Aline, are you okay?</i>
-I'm fine.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.069
<i>This is a huge opportunity for us.</i>

17:10.112 --> 17:13.199
I know.
It's just that seeing César's body--

17:13.281 --> 17:16.661
<i>But that's exactly why</i>
<i>we need to take Ezequiel out.</i>

17:16.743 --> 17:20.080
<i>If I was still the Process leader,</i>
<i>this would have never happened.</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:21.749
I know, I know.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.376
I'll start working on the report.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.710
Thank you, Matheus.

17:41.352 --> 17:45.356
[Joana] Mm. All the candidates
locked in one place?

17:45.439 --> 17:46.774
This reminds me of something.

17:47.525 --> 17:49.235
-I don't think so.
-Why not?

17:49.318 --> 17:51.612
Even the agents seemed worried.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.906
They're good at pretending. Trust me.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.714

18:12.717 --> 18:14.427
Just some weird questions.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.761
About?

18:16.721 --> 18:17.847
Poison.

18:18.472 --> 18:20.975
The guy who got sick was poisoned?

18:21.475 --> 18:22.560
I don't think so.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.479
They just wanna see how
we're going to react.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.648
How we react to an agent's murder? Why?

18:28.232 --> 18:30.192
To see what theories we come up with.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.777
[Daniel] What does that prove?

18:31.861 --> 18:35.197
-Who has the best imagination?
-What's your explanation?

18:35.281 --> 18:38.034
-An infiltrator from the Cause.
-[Joana scoffs]

18:38.117 --> 18:40.578
-This is the safest place there is.
-[Rafael] Well...

18:40.661 --> 18:45.291
I don't know what happened, but...
they could at least give us dinner.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.627
[Joana] Good one, Rafael.
Go ask. I'll wait here.

18:47.710 --> 18:48.544
[Rafael chuckles]

18:48.628 --> 18:50.212
-Uh...
-Go ahead.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.468
[Fernando]
Is this what you were talking about?

18:56.052 --> 18:58.346
-Is it--?
-You don't need to know.

18:59.930 --> 19:02.433
You wouldn't understand.
It's better this way.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.702
Did you interact with Agent César?

19:21.786 --> 19:22.870
Not much.

19:22.953 --> 19:26.332
So, you didn't know what he thought
about your performance?

19:26.957 --> 19:29.293
That it was a little below the curve?

19:29.377 --> 19:30.920
The guy really died?

19:31.087 --> 19:32.630
Yes, Joana. He died.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.175
So, this guy who died
didn't appreciate my style?

19:36.258 --> 19:37.218
-That's right.
-Really?

19:37.301 --> 19:41.597
And you couldn't save him?
With all the technology of the Offshore?

19:43.474 --> 19:45.434
[Rafael] My philosophy is simple:

19:46.268 --> 19:49.647
I'll do anything to pass and nothing
that will prevent me from passing.

19:50.356 --> 19:53.693
I don't know who did this,
but whoever it is...

19:54.276 --> 19:56.028
is the stupidest person I know.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.294
[man over speakers]
<i>Next candidate: Fernando.</i>

20:33.232 --> 20:36.068
What do you know about the death
of Agent César?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.236
His murder.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.116
I don't know anything. I mean...

20:42.241 --> 20:45.703
I saw him fall, then Daniel walked up
and said something...

20:46.370 --> 20:47.705
How did this happen?

20:48.372 --> 20:50.332
What do you know about poison?

20:51.000 --> 20:51.834
Poison?

20:52.793 --> 20:53.627
Nothing.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.796
What do you mean "nothing"?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.215
-There was no rat poison where you lived?
-No, sir.

20:59.967 --> 21:03.137
Did you notice anything odd
with any agents or candidates?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.054
No.

21:04.138 --> 21:07.016
Did you notice any agent
or candidate behaving differently?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.434
More nervous than usual?

21:09.894 --> 21:11.854
-You took too long to answer.
-No.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.732
I was trying to remember
if I saw anyone, but I didn't.

21:14.815 --> 21:18.652
Fernando... now is the time to be honest.

21:20.196 --> 21:23.073
-I understand--
-Better to say too much than too little.

21:25.242 --> 21:29.205
Do you know any candidates who seem
uncertain about the Process?

21:33.834 --> 21:35.920
If you omit anything now,

21:36.003 --> 21:38.964
you may be considered
an accomplice in the future.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.989
[man over speakers]
<i>Next is candidate Michele.</i>

22:30.808 --> 22:31.725
[Ezequiel] Hi, Michele.

22:49.785 --> 22:51.370
Are you comfortable?

22:54.248 --> 22:55.666
Just a little nervous.

22:55.749 --> 22:57.126
Want some water?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.465
Is there anything you want to tell me?

23:04.425 --> 23:06.468
-Anything at all?
-No.

23:15.936 --> 23:17.438
What time did you leave your room?

23:18.105 --> 23:20.399
-About 7--
-At 7:19.

23:20.482 --> 23:22.443
I saw the security camera footage.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.613
Did you go straight to the dining hall?

23:26.989 --> 23:27.823
Yes.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.534
Try some.

23:34.997 --> 23:35.998
It tastes different.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.376
I like it bitter.

23:42.588 --> 23:43.714
What do you think?

23:45.674 --> 23:47.509
-The drink?
-No, the Process.

23:48.469 --> 23:49.720
I'm happy.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.513
I passed.

23:52.181 --> 23:54.808
There's still the Purification ritual.

23:55.934 --> 23:56.769
Sure.

23:58.062 --> 24:00.731
You always knew you'd get far,
right, Michele?

24:02.149 --> 24:03.400
I've always had faith.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.323
I was surprised at the way
you approached me tonight.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.743
The other candidates didn't talk to you?

24:12.826 --> 24:16.747
A few. But you are no ordinary candidate.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.374
No?

24:20.417 --> 24:23.754
Not after that tragedy
with one of the Cause members.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.722
Excuse me.

24:34.682 --> 24:36.392
-What's this?
-It's...

24:40.938 --> 24:43.691
I was mugged a month ago.
They took all I had.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.442
And I got stabbed.

24:45.526 --> 24:48.278
You know Inland medicine, it's very basic.

24:48.362 --> 24:50.447
I had to stitch it up myself.

24:50.781 --> 24:53.242
And it bleeds sometimes--

24:53.325 --> 24:55.703
Do you know how César was murdered?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.961
-No, Daniel said--
-He was poisoned.

25:06.088 --> 25:11.051
As you can imagine, we're wondering how
a foreign substance got into the Process.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.722
At times like these,
we can't let anything slip through.

25:17.516 --> 25:18.892
I want to show you something.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.125
[Luciana] <i>Where's César?</i>

25:43.208 --> 25:45.919
<i>Where? Let me talk to him! César!</i>

25:49.339 --> 25:51.884
[sobbing] <i> César, no!</i>

25:56.472 --> 25:57.890
[sobs continue]

26:03.187 --> 26:04.480
<i>Why?!</i>

26:10.110 --> 26:11.570
<i>I want to know why.</i>

26:35.052 --> 26:36.595
Why did you show me that?

26:37.846 --> 26:41.809
So you can understand
that César was one of us.

26:42.643 --> 26:45.062
A deserving and complete human being.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.688
A man who was loved.

26:47.981 --> 26:49.399
Who is now dead.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.612
I'm going to ask you for the last time...

26:57.366 --> 26:59.326
Are you hiding something from me?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.538
Do you have anything to say?

27:14.091 --> 27:14.925
No.

27:17.261 --> 27:20.347
I don't know what you want me to say,
what you want me to tell you,

27:20.430 --> 27:22.307
-but I have nothing to do--
-You can go.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.393
What?

27:25.936 --> 27:27.896
I need to continue with the questionings.

27:29.898 --> 27:30.732
Go on.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.253
[gasps, whispers] Shit.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.382
Shit.

27:56.300 --> 27:57.467
Shit...

27:58.927 --> 28:00.554
[whispers] I screwed up.

28:01.388 --> 28:02.890
Easy, easy.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.726
-I screwed up.
-Easy.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.936
You were already interrogated
and they let you go. It's okay.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.480
No, it's not. It's not okay.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.608
-Calm down.
-[panting]

28:13.817 --> 28:16.445
-Breathe.
-It wasn't supposed to happen, Fernando.

28:16.528 --> 28:18.488
-Michele.
-Look at me, I'm guilty.

28:18.572 --> 28:19.489
He died.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.617
-They should arrest me.
-No, no.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.828
Look at me. Look at me. That's it...

28:24.912 --> 28:27.623
-Let me go!
-Take a deep breath.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.000
You don't know me.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.089
-[Fernando] Breathe...
-[gasping breaths]

28:36.715 --> 28:37.883
Relax your muscles.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.801
One at a time.

28:41.845 --> 28:45.265
That's it. I had to learn that
because of the pain I get.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.100
Look at me, Michele.

28:49.061 --> 28:51.021
You can't turn yourself in.

28:51.104 --> 28:52.648
If you go, I'll go, too.

28:54.316 --> 28:57.486
I lied for you in there.
We're in this together now.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.074
You should have stayed away from me.

29:57.921 --> 29:59.715
[Fernando] Where are you going?

30:12.519 --> 30:14.354
[Matheus] <i>It's unacceptable.</i>

30:14.438 --> 30:18.483
<i>A murder in your Process,</i>
<i>under your watch.</i>

30:18.567 --> 30:20.944
This homicide was perpetrated
by the Cause.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.946
Unfortunately, it's not that uncommon.

30:23.030 --> 30:24.865
<i>This investigation has to be quick.</i>

30:24.948 --> 30:26.867
<i>We cannot let this get out of hand.</i>

30:26.950 --> 30:28.702
That's why I called this meeting.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.912
The investigation has been closed.

30:30.996 --> 30:33.999
-<i>Have you found the culprit?</i>
-We found her.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.752
She's being arrested as we speak.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.340
-Aline?
-What's going on?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.927
You're under arrest for the murder
of César Franco, Process agent.

31:27.010 --> 31:29.846
Are you crazy? Let me go!

31:29.930 --> 31:31.431
Let me go! Cássia.

31:31.515 --> 31:34.393
Candidates, you may return to your rooms.

31:34.476 --> 31:36.853
Everything's been resolved.
You can sleep in peace.

31:36.937 --> 31:39.940
The culprit was found
and we've already taken action.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.863
Michele, it's over.

31:47.697 --> 31:49.866
-Everything will be okay.
-But the culprit--

31:49.950 --> 31:52.494
It doesn't matter. It's over.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.204
We're gonna be together.

31:57.874 --> 32:00.377
-Is this a joke?
-Don't try anything stupid.

32:00.460 --> 32:02.045
Cássia. Let me go!

32:02.379 --> 32:03.213
Cássia.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.799
You know he's making a huge mistake.
Cássia!

32:10.387 --> 32:12.389
[Ezequiel]
Our investigation has led to Aline.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.224
[Matheus] <i>Aline is not a murderer.</i>

32:14.307 --> 32:17.727
<i>There's no way.</i>
<i>You know that very well, Ezequiel.</i>

32:17.811 --> 32:20.564
I know this must be difficult
for you, Matheus.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.108
After all, she's here on your orders.

32:23.191 --> 32:26.445
-<i>Ezequiel...</i>
-Not that I blame you for César's death,

32:26.528 --> 32:29.531
but it must be quite a weight
on your conscience.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.449
[Matheus] <i>Enough!</i>

32:30.532 --> 32:32.367
<i>Do you have any proof?</i>

32:32.451 --> 32:34.911
<i>Why would Aline want to kill César?</i>

32:34.995 --> 32:36.955
Aline didn't want to kill César.

32:37.038 --> 32:38.832
Aline wanted to kill me.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.545
It was probably at this moment
that she tried to poison me.

32:43.628 --> 32:44.880
<i>This is a farce.</i>

32:44.963 --> 32:47.299
The autopsy revealed the poison used
to kill César

32:47.382 --> 32:50.302
-is a substance used only by the Cause.
-<i>Exactly.</i>

32:50.385 --> 32:53.430
<i>Someone from the Cause</i>
<i>infiltrated your Process.</i>

32:53.513 --> 32:58.143
Actually, someone from the Cause
infiltrated your Process, years ago.

32:58.226 --> 33:00.020
Aline is a member of the Cause,

33:00.103 --> 33:01.980
<i>embedded in our society for years.</i>

33:02.063 --> 33:03.690
That's a lie!

33:03.773 --> 33:05.817
<i>I was her target because</i>
<i>I'm the Process Leader</i>

33:05.901 --> 33:08.361
<i>who ruthlessly hunts down</i>
<i>revolutionary criminals.</i>

33:08.445 --> 33:11.323
-That's a lie.
-<i>I'm still waiting for proof.</i>

33:11.406 --> 33:15.118
We recently captured
a high-ranking member of the Cause.

33:15.202 --> 33:17.120
You can decide for yourselves.

33:20.874 --> 33:22.042
[Cássia] <i>Is that her?</i>

33:24.377 --> 33:25.420
<i>It's her.</i>

33:26.171 --> 33:27.255
<i>Aline.</i>

33:28.048 --> 33:31.801
<i>She's one of our bravest revolutionaries.</i>

33:32.385 --> 33:34.971
<i>I met her when she was only a teenager.</i>

33:35.555 --> 33:37.724
<i>Our leadership trusted her blindly.</i>

33:38.683 --> 33:40.727
<i>She infiltrated the Process...</i>

33:41.686 --> 33:43.313
<i>more than ten years ago.</i>

33:44.397 --> 33:46.149
[Cássia] <i>What was her goal?</i>

33:46.233 --> 33:47.776
[man] <i>She had to lay low.</i>

33:47.859 --> 33:50.820
<i>Little by little,</i>
<i>she would gain people's trust...</i>

33:51.363 --> 33:53.073
<i>move up the hierarchy,</i>

33:53.156 --> 33:56.159
<i>until she had the opportunity</i>
<i>to help the Cause from the inside.</i>

33:56.993 --> 33:58.620
<i>Those were her instructions.</i>

34:00.956 --> 34:04.000
Councilors, I'm not a judge.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.003
You can draw your own conclusions.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.924
I want to hear what Aline has to say.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.134
As you please.

34:15.011 --> 34:15.844
<i>Aline?</i>

34:16.513 --> 34:17.931
<i>We can hear you now.</i>

34:19.181 --> 34:20.976
<i>Do you have anything to say?</i>

34:21.059 --> 34:23.353
I do. What I have to say is this:

34:25.146 --> 34:27.107
This whole story was invented by Ezequiel.

34:27.190 --> 34:30.610
He's afraid because I have proof
of a crime he committed.

34:31.277 --> 34:35.574
I'm sending you a file that contains proof
of the illegal activities

34:35.657 --> 34:36.908
conducted by the Process Leader.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.536
I confess I was waiting for
a better moment to send this material.

34:41.121 --> 34:43.456
<i>But this should be enough</i>
<i>not only to charge him,</i>

34:43.540 --> 34:45.708
but also to send him
to the Recovery Center.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.085
PROCESSING - 100%

34:50.714 --> 34:54.301
<i>Aline, this is the report</i>
<i>you sent me yesterday.</i>

34:54.384 --> 34:55.552
<i>-</i> [Nair] <i> We already read it.</i>
<i>-</i> No.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.013
<i>It's only compliments for Ezequiel.</i>

34:58.096 --> 34:59.723
[Aline] <i>No. Absolutely not.</i>

34:59.806 --> 35:03.268
What I sent you was proof
that he meets a boy in the Inland.

35:03.351 --> 35:04.853
That's what I sent you.

35:05.437 --> 35:07.856
<i>He takes care of a boy in the Inland.</i>

35:07.939 --> 35:09.316
This man is perpetuating a lie.

35:09.941 --> 35:11.651
-I didn't kill anyone--
-[Nair] <i>Aline.</i>

35:11.735 --> 35:13.528
You will be sent to the Offshore.

35:13.612 --> 35:17.574
You will be detained
until you have a fair trial...

35:18.283 --> 35:20.493
and the whole truth has been revealed.

35:20.577 --> 35:21.494
Matheus.

35:23.413 --> 35:27.292
I'm at the Council's full disposal.

35:30.670 --> 35:31.921
I didn't kill anyone...

35:34.758 --> 35:35.884
[whispers] Thank you.

36:01.117 --> 36:03.662
[man]
You're going to keep your promise, right?

36:05.205 --> 36:06.831
Eh? Talk to me!

36:11.878 --> 36:12.921
Aren't you?

36:15.507 --> 36:17.008
I did what you asked.

36:17.884 --> 36:18.927
Come back.

36:19.928 --> 36:21.680
Finish this!

36:22.764 --> 36:24.015
Cássia!

36:26.851 --> 36:28.978
Kill me!

36:31.147 --> 36:32.190
[softly] Kill me.

36:58.758 --> 36:59.843
I'm tired.
