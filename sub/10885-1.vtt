01:26.478 --> 01:27.478
Yeah.

01:29.513 --> 01:32.613
- Incoming.
- Here you go.

01:34.419 --> 01:36.353
- Iqbal, order up!
- Hey!

01:36.454 --> 01:38.021
Hey, did Humera get
that promotion yet?

01:38.122 --> 01:40.162
The boss is gonna think about it.
It's looking good.

01:40.186 --> 01:41.186
Nice.

01:42.693 --> 01:44.393
Lon. Lon. Lon!

01:45.963 --> 01:48.098
Jimmy Buffett. Who?

01:48.199 --> 01:49.900
Sleeping, buddy?

01:50.001 --> 01:52.002
No, adjustmenting.

01:54.238 --> 01:56.506
Crikey, is it time to
close this bitch or what?

01:56.607 --> 01:58.141
We got about another hour.

01:58.242 --> 02:00.523
Lon, you ever thought about
getting the laser eye surgery?

02:00.547 --> 02:03.380
They say only about one in 1,500
people don't see results.

02:03.481 --> 02:06.950
That's a risk I'm not
willing to take.

02:07.051 --> 02:08.050
See you.

02:09.687 --> 02:12.422
- Mom, can I get this?
- No, honey, it's too expensive.

02:12.523 --> 02:13.824
Please. But I really want this.

02:13.925 --> 02:16.893
Actually that's 40% off.
Open box policy.

02:16.994 --> 02:19.863
- Today's your lucky day, buddy.
- Wow, tell him thank you.

02:19.964 --> 02:21.164
Thank you.

02:24.268 --> 02:26.403
- Hi, Zack.
- Hey. What's up, Semi?

02:26.504 --> 02:28.171
My mom made you some
blueberry muffins.

02:28.272 --> 02:29.840
Oh, what a sweetheart.

02:29.941 --> 02:32.509
That is where you get your
charm from, isn't it, Semi?

02:32.610 --> 02:34.010
I guess so.

02:36.881 --> 02:37.881
Damn it!

02:41.152 --> 02:45.552
Not this month, Zack.
Not this month.

02:51.996 --> 02:53.396
Who's Anal?

02:53.498 --> 02:55.766
It's anal, dumb-ass.

02:55.867 --> 02:57.467
Anal? You do?

02:58.469 --> 03:01.805
Since when are you in the
business of asking me questions?

03:01.906 --> 03:03.573
This is cashier number one.

03:03.674 --> 03:07.210
Tell Zack he's messed with
the bull one too many times.

03:07.311 --> 03:09.780
The bull's in the china shop.

03:09.881 --> 03:13.450
I am the bull, he
is the china shop.

03:13.551 --> 03:16.153
My uncle had a bull.
Big cojones.

03:16.254 --> 03:18.954
Jorge's uncle had a...

03:20.758 --> 03:25.458
Do not speak to me
when I am on-line.

03:27.832 --> 03:31.401
Hey, man. Looks like
you're in trouble, guy.

03:31.502 --> 03:35.238
Let's just focus here, okay, Russell?
Let's look what we got here.

03:35.339 --> 03:37.407
My dented deviled ham

03:37.508 --> 03:40.710
for your crushed bread and broken
peanut-butter-and-jelly jars.

03:40.811 --> 03:44.247
Wait a minute. PB and J,
that's like gold, man.

03:44.348 --> 03:48.948
Deviled ham is almost
a spiritual meal.

03:50.621 --> 03:53.321
Okay, fine. You're on.

03:53.658 --> 03:57.761
- Well, let's go then.
- Let's go.

03:57.862 --> 04:00.397
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

04:00.498 --> 04:02.766
- Paper covers rock! All me!
- Damn.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.202
Cameron, bag up my stuff for me.
I'll take that.

04:05.303 --> 04:10.740
- Now, that's not part of the deal, guy.
- Heads up.

04:10.841 --> 04:13.141
It smells like ass.

04:13.444 --> 04:14.744
He's so...

04:17.615 --> 04:20.450
- Have you seen Zack?
- No?

04:20.551 --> 04:23.320
Well, I bet if he were covered in
chocolate and had a nougat inside,

04:23.421 --> 04:27.821
you'd know exactly
where he were at.

04:31.162 --> 04:34.030
- That your pen?
- I don't know.

04:34.131 --> 04:36.466
- Well, where did you get it?
- I don't know.

04:36.567 --> 04:39.169
- Who gave it to you?
- I don't know.

04:39.270 --> 04:43.173
Is your name Semi because you're
the size of a huge Mack truck,

04:43.274 --> 04:45.442
or because you're semi-retarded?

04:45.543 --> 04:48.178
- I don't know.
- Idiot.

04:48.279 --> 04:51.314
Attention Super Club shoppers.
We're closing in five minutes.

04:51.415 --> 04:56.086
So if you could please finish in
five minutes, that would be great.

04:56.187 --> 04:58.355
- There you are.
- You're in deep, homes.

04:58.456 --> 05:02.192
- He does not do anal.
- That's too bad for you, Jorge.

05:02.293 --> 05:03.593
Do you know what this is?

05:03.694 --> 05:06.796
Yes. That is a 10-times-larger-than-life
replica of your penis.

05:06.897 --> 05:09.397
Oh, that's hilarious.

05:10.034 --> 05:13.370
I realize that you don't care
about your job, but I do.

05:13.471 --> 05:15.671
And I want to thank you for
caring about my job, really.

05:15.695 --> 05:17.307
My job, jerk-off.

05:17.408 --> 05:19.342
You know, it's funny.
For the past 10 years,

05:19.443 --> 05:22.979
I've been climbing the Super
Club food chain, as planned.

05:23.080 --> 05:26.082
But you, you haven't
moved at all.

05:26.183 --> 05:28.051
I'm almost at the top.

05:28.152 --> 05:33.156
It goes manager, section manager,
head cashier, cashier, stocker,

05:33.257 --> 05:37.127
clean-up crew, night clean-up
guy, and lastly, box boy.

05:37.228 --> 05:38.862
- That's what you are.
- That's me.

05:38.963 --> 05:42.599
Yeah. That's why you can't come
into the cashiers' lounge.

05:42.700 --> 05:44.000
You know, after all this time,

05:44.101 --> 05:46.581
you'd think you'd understand that
you're the lowest of the low.

05:46.637 --> 05:48.738
Yeah, the lowest of the low.

05:48.839 --> 05:50.440
Aren't you a box
boy, too, Jorge?

05:50.541 --> 05:52.576
Oh yeah, but he's my box boy.

05:52.677 --> 05:54.778
Yeah, I'm his box boy.

05:54.879 --> 05:57.047
Your love for him
concerns and confuses me.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.282
You listen to me, jerk-off,
and you listen well.

05:59.383 --> 06:01.685
- Chill, boss, it's Glen.
- Mr. Gary.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.620
- Mr. Gary.
- Hey, what do you say, boss-man?

06:03.721 --> 06:06.389
Good evening, gentlemen.
Meeting in 60 seconds,

06:06.490 --> 06:09.025
and I've got big news.

06:09.126 --> 06:10.994
Thanks for being prompt.

06:11.095 --> 06:14.331
Well, we got the call from
Corporate, and it's official.

06:14.432 --> 06:16.666
Today Vince broke the
check-stand speed record

06:16.767 --> 06:21.238
and has been officially recognized as
the fastest in the south-west region.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.174
Needless to say, you've
earned this one, Vince.

06:24.275 --> 06:27.811
Dirk, go ahead. Put the star up.

06:27.912 --> 06:30.080
Congratulations to Vince,

06:30.181 --> 06:33.516
employee of the month
for 17 months in a row.

06:33.617 --> 06:36.920
- Yeah. Yeah.
- He always wins.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.623
As most of you know, if
Vince gets to number 18,

06:39.724 --> 06:41.625
he'll go into the hall of fame,

06:41.726 --> 06:44.294
he'll be put on the fast
track for management,

06:44.395 --> 06:49.466
and he'll win a brand-newish
2005 Chevy Malibu!

06:49.567 --> 06:51.967
- Yeah!
- All right!

06:52.570 --> 06:56.373
I realize that Vince has won
the last 17 in a row, but hey,

06:56.474 --> 06:57.907
it's anybody's ball game.

06:58.008 --> 07:00.777
And I like to encourage
everyone to compete.

07:00.878 --> 07:05.115
A little extra effort could earn
you a star. It really could.

07:05.216 --> 07:09.753
So grab a broom, help a lost
customer, pick up a spill.

07:09.854 --> 07:12.522
Don't be afraid to
go above and beyond.

07:12.623 --> 07:14.491
I welcome all challengers.

07:14.592 --> 07:16.860
"I welcome all challengers."

07:16.961 --> 07:18.962
I am so proud of you.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.641
Well, nobody has ever
been to the magic 18

07:21.665 --> 07:24.267
before, so this is a
really big deal, people.

07:24.368 --> 07:28.972
The store will close early on the 30th
for a special banquet award show.

07:29.073 --> 07:30.073
Yeah.

07:31.008 --> 07:34.110
Now, it'll be semi-formal
and mandatory,

07:34.211 --> 07:36.079
which means church
clothes, please, everyone.

07:36.180 --> 07:38.315
- Mandatory?
- It'll be fun to dress up.

07:38.416 --> 07:45.055
Corporate will be there and we need
everybody to be at your very best behavior.

07:45.156 --> 07:48.958
- Sorry, sir.
- Why'd you do that?

07:49.059 --> 07:54.230
Lastly, we'll have a new cashier
joining the team tomorrow.

07:54.331 --> 07:56.166
- Her name is...
- Amy Renfroe.

07:56.267 --> 07:57.267
Amy...

07:57.568 --> 08:01.368
So please make her feel welcome.

08:03.007 --> 08:06.009
Yeah, let's give her a
warm Super Club welcome.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.310
- Super Club!
- Super Club!

08:09.747 --> 08:12.215
- Yeah, Super Club.
- Super Club.

08:12.316 --> 08:14.316
Thank you, Vince.

08:14.885 --> 08:17.587
All right, everybody,
be safe out there.

08:17.688 --> 08:21.291
Now, don't forget to sign-up for the
softball game against Maxi-Mart,

08:21.392 --> 08:23.593
'cause we need players.

08:23.694 --> 08:24.928
How could you do that?

08:25.029 --> 08:29.466
Hey, guy, we're headed over to the
Steaksmith for a drink. You in?

08:29.567 --> 08:31.447
No. I'm having dinner with
the old lady tonight.

08:31.471 --> 08:32.971
Need a lift?

08:34.871 --> 08:35.871
No.

08:48.319 --> 08:53.790
- Where's that beautiful lady of mine?
- Right in here. I'm on my last Scratcher.

08:53.891 --> 08:55.658
Grandma, I think it's
time that you invest

08:55.759 --> 08:59.028
in something a little
less speculative.

08:59.129 --> 09:02.665
You really think I should take
financial advice from you?

09:02.766 --> 09:05.166
One-nothing, Grandma.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.047
What have we got here?
Okay, pay attention.

09:18.148 --> 09:21.848
Where's it going? What's that?

09:22.152 --> 09:26.189
Oh, Lean Pockets. Somebody
takes care of themselves.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.626
Oh, well, now, I refuse to believe
that's not your natural hair color.

09:29.727 --> 09:31.027
Oh, stop it!

09:31.128 --> 09:32.362
Oh, that's a lot of lotion.

09:32.463 --> 09:34.631
Somebody's gonna pamper
themselves tonight.

09:34.732 --> 09:35.799
Maybe I will.

09:35.900 --> 09:39.169
Your total is $69.60...
Just kidding, $24.08.

09:39.270 --> 09:42.772
Oh, gosh, did you get
these here at Super Club?

09:42.873 --> 09:45.842
Oh, they smell wonderful.
They really do.

09:45.943 --> 09:49.679
Look at them. Like moths
around a dim yellow bulb.

09:49.780 --> 09:51.581
Yeah, he's like Cirque
du Soleil over there.

09:51.682 --> 09:53.483
Oh, the Zumanity.

09:53.584 --> 09:57.020
Anyone can do that.
Anyone could do that.

09:57.121 --> 10:01.324
Okay, and you've been employee
of the month how many times?

10:01.425 --> 10:02.792
He's got a point.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.027
Wait a second here.

10:04.128 --> 10:06.629
You have no idea how much
planning and energy it takes

10:06.730 --> 10:10.133
to keep such a low profile, okay?
It's practically an art, what I do.

10:10.234 --> 10:13.503
- Zack, boxes needed at checkout four.
- I'm on it.

10:13.604 --> 10:15.004
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, what's up, Semi?

10:15.028 --> 10:18.741
Do me a favor. Can you bring some
boxes over to checkout four?

10:18.842 --> 10:19.842
Okay.

10:21.345 --> 10:24.845
- Yeah.
- It's quite an art.

10:26.717 --> 10:28.717
Now, that's art.

10:37.761 --> 10:40.296
She is totally untouchable.

10:40.397 --> 10:43.166
No, she's hot, but every
girl's got a vulnerable place.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.269
Yeah, it's called the dingly.

10:46.370 --> 10:48.705
I'll see you guys later.

10:48.806 --> 10:52.942
Hey, Zack, don't forget Sasha... Tasha...
Mikhal has soccer practice at 11:00.

10:53.043 --> 10:54.444
- You're covering for me.
- Got it.

10:54.545 --> 10:56.646
Excuse me, do you have
a membership card?

10:56.747 --> 10:58.847
Sir, I work here.

10:59.850 --> 11:01.751
- Really?
- What's going on, Joe?

11:01.852 --> 11:04.687
This lady doesn't have
a membership card.

11:04.788 --> 11:09.726
- Oh, I'll take it from here, bro.
- Yeah, go to it, Zack.

11:09.827 --> 11:11.728
Listen, I'm gonna let
you pass this time,

11:11.829 --> 11:15.999
but next time you might want to
use the "my dog ate it" excuse.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.667
Maybe wear an eye
patch or something.

11:17.768 --> 11:19.602
Because nobody's gonna
believe you work here.

11:19.703 --> 11:23.773
No seriously, it's supposed to be my
first day. I just transferred from 232.

11:23.874 --> 11:26.075
- You're the new cashier?
- I'm Amy.

11:26.176 --> 11:27.176
Hey.

11:28.245 --> 11:29.685
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- It's okay.

11:29.747 --> 11:34.417
Nobody would believe... 'Cause
you don't look like you would...

11:34.518 --> 11:35.718
I'm Zack.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.887
I tried to tell him, but
he wouldn't listen.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.822
Yeah, he gets a little
stubborn sometimes.

11:39.923 --> 11:41.368
You give a guy a badge
and suddenly gets

11:41.392 --> 11:43.036
- this false sense of power.
- A false sense of power.

11:43.060 --> 11:45.140
- Jinx, you owe me a Coke.
- Jinx, you owe me a Coke.

11:45.164 --> 11:46.763
- No way.
- No way.

11:46.864 --> 11:48.064
Hi, there.

11:48.232 --> 11:51.634
Check stand number one.
Head cashier, Vince Downey.

11:51.735 --> 11:53.703
Vince Downey? I've heard of you.

11:53.804 --> 11:56.072
You have the fastest
hands in the south-west.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.774
8.9 pass-through rate, huh?

11:57.875 --> 12:02.712
Oh, boy. Well, I guess my reputation
has preceded me once again.

12:02.813 --> 12:03.846
It's actually 9.1,

12:03.947 --> 12:06.783
now that I set the south-west regional
speed ring competition record.

12:06.884 --> 12:11.054
- That's amazing. I'm Amy Renfroe.
- Oh, wow. Renfroe.

12:11.155 --> 12:12.955
Is that Nordic?

12:13.757 --> 12:14.924
I don't think so.

12:15.025 --> 12:18.328
Well I was just judging from
your Romanesque stature.

12:18.429 --> 12:21.230
I assumed you were from Nordica.

12:21.331 --> 12:25.735
Nordica, that's just north
of Timberland, right, Vince?

12:25.836 --> 12:28.237
Oh, he's quick with a joke
or to light up your smoke.

12:28.338 --> 12:30.773
I see you met Zack. He's
one of our box boys.

12:30.874 --> 12:32.675
Yeah, he's in charge
of the boxes.

12:32.776 --> 12:35.411
- Box boy?
- Well, more of a Zack of all trades.

12:35.512 --> 12:38.648
Zack, we still need some
boxes at check stand 10.

12:38.749 --> 12:39.749
Minute.

12:40.584 --> 12:42.986
So many boxes, so little time.

12:43.087 --> 12:46.356
You know I just started my break. I'd love
to show you the store, if you'd like.

12:46.457 --> 12:47.993
Oh, my God. That'd be great.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.817
Yeah, let's start off in
the cashiers' lounge.

12:49.841 --> 12:53.296
- Okay. Nice to meet you, Zack.
- Nice to meet you too, Amy.

12:53.397 --> 12:56.032
Wow. That's got to hurt.

12:56.133 --> 12:59.202
Man, he is always doing that to you.
Stealing your thunder.

12:59.303 --> 13:03.506
Remember the redhead in Gardening?
Bonked her behind the monkey grass.

13:03.607 --> 13:07.343
And the Asian in Automotive. Did
her on a pile of carburetors.

13:07.444 --> 13:13.716
Oh, and the blond in Frozen
Foods with the "Turkey's done!"

13:13.817 --> 13:16.886
- You remember her?
- Yeah. But it ain't over yet.

13:16.987 --> 13:17.987
Okay.

13:18.222 --> 13:22.058
Russell, I need all the 411 on Amy Renfroe.
She's the new cashier.

13:22.159 --> 13:23.459
- And I need that stat.
- Yeah.

13:23.560 --> 13:25.560
- On it.
- Good.

13:25.662 --> 13:28.862
Lilly, Daddy's coming home.

14:01.282 --> 14:05.082
Pleasure doing
business with you.

14:34.715 --> 14:37.035
Come on, guys, let's respect
the sanctity of the clubhouse.

14:37.131 --> 14:42.117
- How's that B-52 coming along?
- Oh, cherry.

14:42.218 --> 14:46.323
Hey, guy, I got the 411
on your little Aphrodite.

14:46.424 --> 14:47.091
All right.

14:47.192 --> 14:50.227
I made some calls. Got
a buddy on the inside.

14:50.328 --> 14:53.500
Cost me a dented cheese
pallet, but I got the scoop.

14:53.601 --> 14:54.721
All right, come on, come on.

14:54.804 --> 15:00.834
Apparently she requested the transfer
due to some romantic issues.

15:00.935 --> 15:02.206
Okay, what kind of issues?

15:02.307 --> 15:06.925
Well, I think she has a thing
for the employee of the month.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.026
No way.

15:08.249 --> 15:11.093
Yeah, that picture
goes up on the wall,

15:11.194 --> 15:14.104
she slides into the sack
like a singed koala

15:14.128 --> 15:17.062
looking for an
all-night burn center.

15:17.163 --> 15:18.701
- No shit.
- Yeah.

15:18.802 --> 15:21.147
You know what? I
don't believe it.

15:21.248 --> 15:24.848
I know this. We had a moment.

15:27.194 --> 15:30.163
Well apparently your girl's
having another moment.

15:30.264 --> 15:34.364
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Oh, boy.

15:35.814 --> 15:38.515
The bad news, you
got carpel tunnel.

15:38.616 --> 15:43.649
Check it out, guy. He's the
alpha male of the store.

15:43.750 --> 15:49.436
Chicks always go after the alpha male.
They're like lions, kings of the desert.

15:49.537 --> 15:53.117
And you, you're just a
little, tiny field mouse

15:53.218 --> 15:57.672
dangling in the teeth of the lion,
while he's banging your chick.

15:57.773 --> 15:59.690
No, wait a minute, box boy.

15:59.791 --> 16:03.123
You're like the little hairy nutsack
on the little hairy field mouse,

16:03.224 --> 16:06.156
swinging back and forth while he's
banging your chick, going back...

16:06.257 --> 16:07.257
Russell.

16:09.823 --> 16:10.823
Yeah?

16:11.360 --> 16:16.266
Your metaphors are magical,
but shut the hell up, please.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.367
Roger.

16:19.219 --> 16:24.090
Just going back and forth, hairy
Kalahari-style, in and out with his big...

16:24.191 --> 16:27.591
- Pete!
- Discovery Channel...

16:28.428 --> 16:33.628
Well, fine. I'll win
employee of the month.

16:36.103 --> 16:39.505
What? Come on. Seriously,
how hard could it be?

16:39.606 --> 16:44.577
Oh, you're kidding, right? You know,
you can't ever be late, ever, at all.

16:44.678 --> 16:47.913
- Easy.
- And you can't get any complaints, guy.

16:48.014 --> 16:49.014
Fine.

16:49.149 --> 16:50.927
- Yeah, but you also have to...
- Go above and beyond...

16:50.951 --> 16:54.071
- with your job description. Go beyond...
- and use your job description.

16:54.172 --> 16:55.772
- The duties of your job.
- Way above.

16:55.796 --> 17:00.192
I'm serious, you guys. I'm gonna
win employee of the month.

17:00.293 --> 17:03.062
Having fun? I hope
you wore protection.

17:03.163 --> 17:06.732
You know, maybe you should listen
to your loser buddies, okay?

17:06.833 --> 17:10.136
- You ain't got a shot.
- Okay, who's calling me a loser?

17:10.237 --> 17:13.372
Easy there, Hubble Telescope.
No need to get physical.

17:13.473 --> 17:16.474
No, I'm serious. I can't see
who's calling me a loser.

17:16.576 --> 17:18.536
Well, I'll give you a hint.
He waxes his forearms,

17:18.560 --> 17:20.680
and he lost his virginity
in the Boy Scouts.

17:20.781 --> 17:23.683
- Uncle Donny?
- Perhaps you've forgotten,

17:23.784 --> 17:26.819
I have the fastest check stand
in the south-west region.

17:26.920 --> 17:27.920
South-west, man.

17:27.988 --> 17:30.990
I'm gonna obliterate the
employee-of-the-month record.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.392
- Obliterate it, boss.
- You're a dink.

17:33.493 --> 17:35.127
You will not stand in my way.

17:35.228 --> 17:38.197
- Bring it.
- I'll bring it, 'cause game is on.

17:38.298 --> 17:42.234
And someone's going to get hurt. But
the someone is not gonna be me.

17:42.335 --> 17:44.735
That means you, man.

17:46.373 --> 17:49.675
I am the boss and I get the last word.
Damn it.

17:49.776 --> 17:52.712
- All right, boss. I'm sorry.
- Jorge, shut up.

17:52.813 --> 17:54.480
- Sorry.
- Jorge!

17:54.581 --> 17:57.281
- Okay.
- God damn it!

17:58.985 --> 18:02.885
He's going down. I'm gonna win.

18:14.067 --> 18:19.567
Hey, Grandma. Gram, come
here, check this out.

18:21.041 --> 18:25.711
- Remember this guy?
- Yeah. Didn't he have his own place?

18:25.812 --> 18:28.712
I love you too, Grandma.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.010
Yeah. Yeah.

19:35.815 --> 19:36.815
What?

19:37.617 --> 19:38.617
Hey!

19:42.556 --> 19:43.556
Wow.

19:44.925 --> 19:47.059
I was just warming
it up for you, boss.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.860
You wanna see what
gets me warm, Jorge?

19:57.003 --> 20:00.203
It's sweet. Is it leather?

20:00.974 --> 20:05.074
Oh, no. It's pleather.
Way better.

20:05.445 --> 20:08.614
It won't fade or crack with age.

20:08.715 --> 20:12.715
Hey, come on, stay
off the glass.

20:13.119 --> 20:15.488
So what are you gonna do
with your set of wheels?

20:15.589 --> 20:17.389
Sell, most likely.

20:17.490 --> 20:19.258
- How much?
- I don't know.

20:19.359 --> 20:22.127
It's probably going to be a multi-bid
situation. Are you interested?

20:22.228 --> 20:25.397
Of course. It means
the world to me.

20:25.498 --> 20:27.498
I'm gonna think.

20:29.636 --> 20:30.636
No way.

20:32.138 --> 20:33.706
Hey, good morning.

20:33.807 --> 20:36.308
Good morning, Super Club people.

20:36.409 --> 20:38.444
Zack Bradley just punching
in on the bright.

20:38.545 --> 20:42.214
Extra effort. Doing it the Super Club
way by getting here nice and early.

20:42.315 --> 20:48.115
And I'm punching my very
own on-time indicator.

20:49.456 --> 20:53.225
Holy crap. You're really
serious about this?

20:53.326 --> 20:58.626
I told you I could do this.
I can do this.

20:59.132 --> 21:06.232
Here you go, Sam. Boxes, Mike.
All you. Here you go, Nick.

21:06.640 --> 21:08.073
- Hey, what's up, Amy?
- Hi.

21:08.174 --> 21:11.474
Do you need any more boxes?

21:12.312 --> 21:13.612
No, thank you.

21:13.713 --> 21:16.682
Okay. Well, listen, if there's anything
else you need, I'm gonna be here...

21:16.783 --> 21:20.083
Five minutes or I'm buying!

21:41.007 --> 21:42.307
Oh, please.

21:43.176 --> 21:48.076
Like I said, five
minutes or I'm buying.

21:48.248 --> 21:51.548
And ten, nine, eight, seven,

21:53.186 --> 21:55.086
six, five, four,

21:56.756 --> 21:58.556
three two, one!

22:01.494 --> 22:02.494
Come on!

22:11.404 --> 22:14.807
See, you can't beat
a guy like that.

22:14.908 --> 22:16.308
Yes, I can.

22:16.476 --> 22:17.476
$230.45.

22:19.746 --> 22:22.748
He'll take care of that. I got
to take my union-mandated break,

22:22.849 --> 22:26.249
so, next show in 15 minutes.

22:26.686 --> 22:27.986
Bye, Vince.

22:28.388 --> 22:32.188
- You ready to do this?
- Yeah.

22:33.193 --> 22:37.129
Eagle Eye, this is Brown Trouser.
We are go. How?

22:37.230 --> 22:43.030
Eagle... This is Brown...
Brown Eye. It's a go.

22:46.306 --> 22:49.006
Clean-up on aisle 313.

23:01.988 --> 23:05.288
You've gotta be kidding me!

23:17.437 --> 23:20.773
- Not today!
- Oh, yeah. It's today, Vince!

23:20.874 --> 23:24.274
- No way, Zack!
- I got it!

23:45.799 --> 23:47.899
I almost had him.

23:50.503 --> 23:56.675
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. Here you go, Zack.
If you pass out, you call 911.

23:56.776 --> 23:57.776
Got it.

24:04.417 --> 24:06.817
Let me guess. Vince?

24:07.320 --> 24:12.420
You know I can't say.
You know the rules.

24:27.707 --> 24:28.907
Look away.

24:36.449 --> 24:37.449
Pretty.

24:47.927 --> 24:48.927
Yeah.

24:49.028 --> 24:50.948
Looks like it's gonna be
harder than you thought.

24:50.972 --> 24:53.732
Not to worry. I've got 29
more days to leave a mark.

24:53.833 --> 24:55.567
Looks like you already have.

24:55.668 --> 24:58.170
Hey, don't forget. Party
at my house tonight.

24:58.271 --> 25:00.372
Ain't no party like
an Iqbal party.

25:00.473 --> 25:01.473
Word.

25:07.580 --> 25:08.580
Amy!

25:11.751 --> 25:13.851
- Amy, hey.
- Hi.

25:14.220 --> 25:15.587
- How you doing?
- Good.

25:15.688 --> 25:19.057
Listen, I was wondering if maybe you
wanted to go to this party tonight.

25:19.158 --> 25:22.238
I know you don't know a lot of people.
There's gonna be a lot of people there.

25:22.262 --> 25:24.930
It might be kind of cool
if you want to go with me.

25:25.031 --> 25:28.467
Oh, I actually have
dinner plans with Vince.

25:28.568 --> 25:30.836
Oh, well, that's cool. That will be good.
It'll be fun.

25:30.937 --> 25:34.439
I gotta go to this thing. Going to be
a lot of friends and stuff like that.

25:34.540 --> 25:38.844
I don't have to go, but...
I mean, I do, but...

25:38.945 --> 25:41.947
- I guess I'll just... I'll see you later.
- All right.

25:42.048 --> 25:46.418
- And where's he taking you?
- Steaksmith?

25:46.519 --> 25:48.353
- Classy.
- Yeah.

25:48.454 --> 25:50.854
All right, my break's over, so
I'm gonna get some more water.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.692
- Gotcha.
- It's free in there.

25:53.793 --> 25:57.193
- Do you want some?
- Water?

25:58.364 --> 26:00.465
No. I don't want any water.
I'm good.

26:00.566 --> 26:02.568
- Okay. All right.
- All right. All right.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.369
- Bye.
- I'll see you later.

26:04.470 --> 26:06.470
Enjoy your water.

26:10.443 --> 26:13.178
Oh, hey, boxy lady. Are you
looking for your lounge?

26:13.279 --> 26:15.480
I think it's over there.

26:15.581 --> 26:17.581
Yeah, over there.

26:18.618 --> 26:19.918
Over there.

26:22.522 --> 26:23.522
Amy!

26:25.058 --> 26:27.793
- Excuse me.
- How can I help you?

26:27.894 --> 26:30.562
I dropped my glasses off this morning.
Are they ready?

26:30.663 --> 26:34.166
- No.
- Isn't this "Glasses in an Hour"?

26:34.267 --> 26:38.967
No. This is "Glasses
in About an Hour".

26:39.672 --> 26:45.310
- So when can I pick them up?
- In about an hour.

26:45.411 --> 26:49.011
Are you staring at my breasts?

26:50.049 --> 26:51.749
I don't know.

26:53.052 --> 26:54.052
Freak.

26:57.590 --> 26:58.890
Hey, Vince.

27:01.995 --> 27:05.230
Vince! Hey, what's up, man?

27:05.331 --> 27:09.668
There is a massive rumor going around
that you have a hot date tonight.

27:09.769 --> 27:13.238
As a matter of fact, I do.
With Amy.

27:13.339 --> 27:14.673
Nice, man! Yeah.

27:14.774 --> 27:17.042
- Whoa. What is this?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:17.143 --> 27:18.577
You hitting the gym?

27:18.678 --> 27:21.146
Yeah, I'm hitting the gym. I
like to do some core work.

27:21.247 --> 27:23.815
- Doing some squats?
- Yeah, I do. I squat it out.

27:23.916 --> 27:26.919
Wow, it is working. What is that, pecs?
Doing some of that?

27:27.020 --> 27:28.020
Yeah.

27:28.154 --> 27:30.756
Okay! Just lay off, buddy.

27:30.857 --> 27:33.257
- All right.
- Okay?

27:33.526 --> 27:36.395
Listen, I'm going to tell you something.
You probably already know,

27:36.496 --> 27:41.533
but first dates are so important, you know?
It's really crucial

27:41.634 --> 27:45.370
that you make an amazing first impression.
I know you know that.

27:45.471 --> 27:47.139
Are we through here?

27:47.240 --> 27:51.410
That's it, man, just have
a good time tonight.

27:51.511 --> 27:53.911
You are working out.

28:01.721 --> 28:07.225
Jesus Christ. Where the hell
are we, Chuck E. Cheese-istan?

28:07.326 --> 28:10.662
How many kids you got
there, eight balls?

28:10.763 --> 28:13.999
- Just 22.
- So, whose birthday is it anyhow?

28:14.100 --> 28:18.603
Whoever blows the candles out
first, they get the presents.

28:18.704 --> 28:25.477
Hey, Zack, that employee of the month thing
isn't really working out for you, is it?

28:25.578 --> 28:27.278
What the fuck?

28:28.314 --> 28:30.282
Come on. Come on, you guys.

28:30.383 --> 28:33.318
I think it's great. There's
honor in a good day's work.

28:33.419 --> 28:36.321
There is no honor working
in that black hole.

28:36.422 --> 28:37.723
Think about it, guys.

28:37.824 --> 28:42.661
We could be working over there at
Maxi-Mart, and that place really sucks.

28:42.762 --> 28:44.563
Pass me the chips
there, eight balls.

28:44.664 --> 28:48.533
Plus, I hear they make you wear those
house-arrest ankle-bracelet things,

28:48.634 --> 28:50.736
the dog collars, on your ankles.

28:50.837 --> 28:53.305
So they know where you
are all the time,

28:53.406 --> 28:57.109
and if you leave the main floor
you get a little shocker.

28:57.210 --> 28:58.210
True.

28:58.511 --> 29:02.047
I knew a guy in upper
management, man, went crazy.

29:02.148 --> 29:05.150
Strapped one of those things
around his hairy ball sack,

29:05.251 --> 29:09.955
ran out into the parking lot and blew a $3
Hawaiian wonder cooler all over the place.

29:10.056 --> 29:11.289
Ids-kay. Ids-kay.

29:11.390 --> 29:14.526
Knocked a little Korean kid right
out of his shopping basket.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.729
Oh, speaking of $3
Honolulu wonder coolers,

29:17.830 --> 29:20.899
isn't Vince going out
with Amy tonight?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.568
Yes, yes, he is. But that
could prove problematic,

29:23.669 --> 29:26.569
since I have his wallet.

29:27.240 --> 29:30.442
You want to get some
pizzas and some hookers?

29:30.543 --> 29:33.845
I mean, why climb Everest when
you can set a land speed record?

29:33.946 --> 29:37.946
- That's my goal.
- Here you go.

29:43.689 --> 29:44.689
Zack.

29:47.226 --> 29:49.106
I must have forgotten my
wallet in my other car.

29:49.178 --> 29:53.015
Oh, well, for the fastest checker in
the south-west, it's on the house.

29:53.116 --> 29:55.851
Wow. Thanks, Sandy, that's
really nice of you.

29:55.952 --> 29:58.887
Are you kidding me? A freebie
is the least I can do.

29:58.988 --> 30:01.924
You know what, how about I
go get you a dessert menu?

30:02.025 --> 30:06.125
Oh, that'd be great, huh?
Dessert.

30:10.467 --> 30:12.968
She's one of my regulars
on check stand one.

30:13.069 --> 30:16.271
Wow, your customers seem
to really like you.

30:16.372 --> 30:21.572
You know, I care. Maybe
that's my downfall,

30:22.445 --> 30:25.247
but I think it's important.

30:25.348 --> 30:30.648
Wow. Those are amazing.
So big and inviting.

30:33.089 --> 30:36.024
Supple. Are they veneers?
Is it a porcelain?

30:36.125 --> 30:37.226
- These?
- Yeah.

30:37.327 --> 30:38.327
Oh, they're mine.

30:38.428 --> 30:41.563
It's like you have ivory
smuggled in or something.

30:41.664 --> 30:44.833
It's intoxicating. I'm
intoxicated by it.

30:44.934 --> 30:45.934
Wow.

30:51.708 --> 30:54.009
Well, that was a
good evening, huh?

30:54.110 --> 30:56.311
Yeah, it was great.

30:56.412 --> 30:58.046
It's nice and early still.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.827
You're not going to go
to bed now, are you?

30:59.851 --> 31:01.951
Yeah, I think so.

31:02.085 --> 31:03.085
Alone?

31:04.420 --> 31:06.920
Okay. Okay. You sure?

31:09.859 --> 31:12.659
Going once. Going twice.

31:14.764 --> 31:19.064
Going three times.
Okay, here we go.

31:24.641 --> 31:31.213
- All right, good night. Good night.
- Okay, all right, okay.

31:31.314 --> 31:34.814
Yes. See you at work, kitten.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.862
- Hey, Vince.
- Zack.

31:49.332 --> 31:53.268
Oh, I found your wallet in front
of the herpes medication.

31:53.369 --> 31:55.404
Wanted to get that back to you.

31:55.505 --> 31:58.540
Yeah, I was probably shopping for
your Christmas present there.

31:58.641 --> 32:00.881
I don't know if you want the
stuff that was in it, but...

32:00.944 --> 32:02.244
Very funny.

32:02.845 --> 32:04.545
Oh, hey, Zack.

32:04.914 --> 32:07.816
My date last night with
Amy, it was spectacular.

32:07.917 --> 32:11.517
I mean, she is a good kisser.

32:12.355 --> 32:15.224
Hey, good luck getting
one of those gold stars.

32:15.325 --> 32:18.827
You got a little schmaltz
or something right...

32:18.928 --> 32:21.864
- I don't buy it.
- Well, I wouldn't lie to you, it's a lot.

32:21.965 --> 32:23.799
I don't fall for jokes.

32:23.900 --> 32:28.700
Okay. Just right there.
Just one... Okay.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.477
I didn't fall for that.

32:43.886 --> 32:49.958
- Wow, I really love this song.
- Oh, it's the best.

32:50.059 --> 32:53.128
- Ten grand, huh?
- Oh, yeah, it's a steal.

32:53.229 --> 32:58.200
This is the car that started it all. And
I got low miles. It's only got 33,000.

32:58.301 --> 33:01.470
But you told me you
flipped it, twice.

33:01.571 --> 33:05.071
Exactly. 233,000. All highway.

33:06.309 --> 33:13.809
That's nothing for an '81. She
runs like a top. Totally mint.

33:15.752 --> 33:16.752
Mint?

33:18.154 --> 33:20.622
I'll tell you what. If you can
find this particular model

33:20.723 --> 33:24.359
with these low miles for
less money, buy it.

33:24.460 --> 33:28.060
Don't think about it, buy it.

33:32.402 --> 33:35.637
- Can I take it for a spin?
- No.

33:35.738 --> 33:39.975
- Well, can you give me a ride home later?
- No.

33:40.076 --> 33:45.447
- Can you give me a ride to the bus stop?
- Absolutely not.

33:45.548 --> 33:48.617
Well, can I stay here with you and
listen to the rest of the song?

33:48.718 --> 33:49.918
Absolutely.

33:58.161 --> 34:01.263
Hey, Zack. Oh, Sustan's got soccer
practice at 11:00. Can you cover for me?

34:01.364 --> 34:02.698
- You got it.
- You're a pal.

34:02.799 --> 34:04.266
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

34:04.367 --> 34:08.904
Can you be on the lookout for a little
boy in a red shirt? He's really lost.

34:09.005 --> 34:11.005
- Vince know about this yet?
- No.

34:11.107 --> 34:13.809
Okay, could you keep this on
the QT for, like, two minutes?

34:13.909 --> 34:15.310
I guess so.

34:15.844 --> 34:17.679
That's probably him.

34:17.780 --> 34:20.080
I'll check it out.

34:34.297 --> 34:35.996
Come on! Yeah!

34:36.165 --> 34:39.434
- No unauthorized use of the equipment!
- You want a piece of me?

34:39.534 --> 34:42.070
- Get away from the machine!
- You'll never take me alive!

34:42.170 --> 34:46.341
- Relinquish your weapon!
- Bring it, bitches!

34:46.442 --> 34:47.442
Suckers!

34:49.312 --> 34:51.312
Oh, that's nice.

34:55.184 --> 34:57.686
Oh, no! You were
hit by a ricochet.

34:57.787 --> 35:00.187
I brought it, bitch.

35:02.291 --> 35:03.491
All right!

35:30.453 --> 35:31.753
Sorry, Zack.

35:31.854 --> 35:35.657
- Oh, thank you. Let's go.
- Mom!

35:35.758 --> 35:40.558
Hey, Zack, I brought
you the small pack.

35:52.141 --> 35:53.675
Hey there, Mr. Gold Star.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.578
- How are you, bright smile?
- Good.

35:56.679 --> 36:03.179
I guess I'm gonna to have
to crank this up a notch.

37:27.904 --> 37:29.504
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:30.539 --> 37:33.508
I know. I know. I missed
drinks last night.

37:33.609 --> 37:36.111
I'm not here for that.

37:36.212 --> 37:39.512
I came outside to pass gas.

37:42.551 --> 37:50.358
Man, this employee-of-the-month thing
is a lot harder than I thought.

37:50.459 --> 37:53.562
Maybe you should just
do it for yourself,

37:53.663 --> 38:00.763
for your pride, and the rest
will come, including the girl.

38:02.004 --> 38:06.404
The universe always
has a plan, Zack.

38:13.983 --> 38:15.083
Told you.

38:16.552 --> 38:21.352
Damn! The thing's
heavier than it looks.

38:21.824 --> 38:27.062
- Hi, do you need some help with that?
- Yes, thank you.

38:27.163 --> 38:30.465
- It's for my husband.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear about that.

38:30.566 --> 38:33.001
Oh, he's not dead. Not yet.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.903
It's just too good
a deal to pass up.

38:35.004 --> 38:37.405
Well, do you need some help
getting it to your car?

38:37.506 --> 38:40.675
No, thank you. The lazy
prick's waiting for me.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.711
I'm gonna make him load it.

38:42.812 --> 38:45.180
Well, good luck
murdering your husband.

38:45.281 --> 38:48.681
If you need my help, holler.

38:49.552 --> 38:51.686
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

38:51.787 --> 38:54.122
That young man is wonderful.

38:54.223 --> 38:56.658
I'll be back for sure,
just because of him.

38:56.759 --> 39:01.559
- Oh, that man there? No surprise.
- No.

39:02.365 --> 39:06.868
This is the guy. He's
a wonderful fella.

39:06.969 --> 39:08.869
Well, thank you.

39:09.071 --> 39:11.606
May I help you find
your way to your car?

39:11.707 --> 39:14.907
I know where it is, idiot.

39:30.726 --> 39:33.762
Hey, Vince. What, they kick you
out of the cashiers' lounge?

39:33.863 --> 39:37.799
No, just here to watch as I
get ever closer to victory.

39:37.900 --> 39:43.238
Five more days and I seal the deal.
Once I get to 16, it's over.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.207
Your math skills are
astonishing, Vince.

39:46.308 --> 39:49.744
All right, here he is.
The man of the hour.

39:49.845 --> 39:53.445
Soon that Malibu will be mine.

39:58.287 --> 40:01.387
Hey, what... Give me this.

40:01.657 --> 40:03.391
Okay, you've made a big mistake.

40:03.492 --> 40:06.861
No mistake. Zack has shown a real
improvement over the last week.

40:06.962 --> 40:08.997
- Come here.
- Oh, yeah.

40:09.098 --> 40:10.898
You're welcome.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.836
Oh, no. Vince, not now.

40:14.937 --> 40:20.241
- Hey, you gotta listen to me.
- Vince, I can't talk to you right now.

40:20.342 --> 40:21.342
Yes!

40:24.713 --> 40:26.247
I'm on the board, come on!

40:26.348 --> 40:28.016
- You the man.
- Yeah.

40:28.117 --> 40:31.119
Wow, Zack, you got a star.
Fantastic.

40:31.220 --> 40:33.621
Oh, that's nothing really.

40:33.722 --> 40:36.558
Nothing? What do you mean, "nothing"?
We should be out celebrating.

40:36.659 --> 40:40.261
- Want to grab a drink after this?
- Yeah, sure.

40:40.362 --> 40:41.962
Really? Great.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.433
I'm late shift, so why don't
you pick me up around 9:00?

40:45.534 --> 40:46.701
- Perfect.
- Okay.

40:46.802 --> 40:47.902
- All right.
- Bye.

40:48.003 --> 40:49.403
Yeah, later.

40:52.241 --> 40:54.142
- Holy shit.
- What'd I tell you?

40:54.243 --> 40:57.746
The female lioness gets a
whiff of that gold star,

40:57.847 --> 41:01.583
and just like that, she's
crawling into your den of desire.

41:01.684 --> 41:05.220
- You think? Really?
- I got a gold star once.

41:05.321 --> 41:07.789
- No. No I didn't.
- Nice.

41:07.890 --> 41:09.824
Pretty impressive how
you snuck one in on me.

41:09.925 --> 41:11.993
But don't get used to it.
It was a fluke.

41:12.094 --> 41:14.295
No box boy's ever won
employee of the month.

41:14.396 --> 41:20.468
You got to be the QB to win the MVP, baby.
Can't be the punter.

41:20.569 --> 41:21.569
Yup.

41:22.771 --> 41:25.373
Iqbal, hey. Just double-checking.
We still on for tonight?

41:25.474 --> 41:27.542
Yeah, sure, of course.
I got you covered.

41:27.643 --> 41:30.045
Thanks, man. You're
a good friend.

41:30.146 --> 41:32.981
Zacky, what do you
want for din-din?

41:33.082 --> 41:36.882
I can't. I have a late dinner.

41:38.454 --> 41:40.654
With whom? A girl?

41:42.358 --> 41:46.995
New girl at work. Cashier. Her name's Amy.
She's very pretty.

41:47.096 --> 41:50.396
Why, you look very handsome.

41:51.367 --> 41:54.669
- Amy's a very lucky girl.
- Thanks, Grams.

41:54.770 --> 41:57.038
Maybe you should plant
the seed tonight.

41:57.139 --> 42:00.708
- What?
- Plant the seed of love.

42:00.809 --> 42:05.246
You know, when you get
ready to kiss her, don't.

42:05.347 --> 42:08.116
Because you mustn't rush things.

42:08.217 --> 42:14.489
Take it easy, because then the seed of love
will blossom into something beautiful.

42:14.590 --> 42:15.924
Thanks, Grams.

42:16.025 --> 42:18.359
- And don't forget...
- Yes?

42:18.460 --> 42:20.760
To wash your balls.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.830
You're the best.

42:33.976 --> 42:36.676
- Buenas noches.
- Hey.

42:38.047 --> 42:41.149
How about me, you and
a bottle of wine?

42:41.250 --> 42:44.018
I got a sweet deal on
some tampered cabernet.

42:44.119 --> 42:47.088
I actually have dinner
plans with Zack tonight.

42:47.189 --> 42:51.189
- Zack? The box boy, Zack?
- Yes.

42:51.961 --> 42:54.861
Awesome. Awesome. Awesome.

42:57.433 --> 42:59.534
That's awesome. Where's
he taking you?

42:59.635 --> 43:01.335
I don't know.

43:03.339 --> 43:07.842
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah. Awesome.

43:07.943 --> 43:12.614
It's like... Smell so good,
now, and I want to...

43:12.715 --> 43:15.815
I wanna kiss you all over

43:17.786 --> 43:20.455
Now, that is some of the best
chicken parmesan I've ever had.

43:20.556 --> 43:25.126
Not a lot of people know about this place.
It's kind of a hidden gem.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.761
I won't tell.

43:26.862 --> 43:29.731
Amy, could I offer you
another box of Merlot?

43:29.832 --> 43:32.800
- No, thanks. Yeah.
- Okay.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.970
So what's on this
evening's agenda?

43:36.071 --> 43:39.374
Okay, this evening's agenda, I'd
thought that we would catch a flick,

43:39.475 --> 43:43.878
and before that, maybe take a few laps
around the race track, play nine holes.

43:43.979 --> 43:45.580
Sounds ambitious.

43:45.681 --> 43:48.201
But we should probably get going
if we're gonna catch the movie.

43:48.225 --> 43:50.618
I don't think we're in
any shape to be driving.

43:50.719 --> 43:58.119
Don't worry about that, Amy.
I've got it all taken care of.

44:00.929 --> 44:03.731
Did you have restricted airflow when
you were in the birthing canal?

44:03.832 --> 44:10.605
Focus. If they're not at the Steaksmith,
where do you think he took her? Think.

44:10.706 --> 44:14.609
I don't know, bro. Her
car is still here.

44:14.710 --> 44:17.545
And I don't think he
even has a license.

44:17.646 --> 44:19.714
I'm clearly the driver.

44:19.815 --> 44:26.915
You were supposed to provide intel.
You have not done that.

44:46.741 --> 44:50.077
Since the invention of the kiss,
there have been five kisses

44:50.178 --> 44:53.914
that were rated the most
passionate, the most pure.

44:54.015 --> 44:57.615
This one left them all behind.

45:01.155 --> 45:02.155
The end.

45:02.957 --> 45:04.291
This is what we gotta do, okay?

45:04.392 --> 45:07.828
You see the lamp post in the middle
of the parking lot? Number seven?

45:07.929 --> 45:11.765
You got to hit the ball, it's
gonna bank off that post.

45:11.866 --> 45:13.466
And if you do that,
you win a free game.

45:13.501 --> 45:14.979
All the way in the middle
of the parking lot?

45:15.003 --> 45:16.963
- I'm gonna show you. No more questions.
- No way.

45:17.064 --> 45:18.831
No more questions, just examples.
Watch this.

45:18.932 --> 45:21.106
- No way.
- Yes way.

45:30.385 --> 45:32.319
- Holy shit!
- That's it! Yes!

45:32.420 --> 45:35.856
Oh, my God, that's amazing! You
spend too much time up here.

45:35.957 --> 45:39.026
I've paid my dues, but
it's your turn, go ahead.

45:39.127 --> 45:43.127
All right, free game.
Hit it off.

45:46.000 --> 45:48.100
My head! My head!

45:49.604 --> 45:53.704
Where did that come from?
Shut up!

45:54.008 --> 45:56.308
We're under attack.

45:56.611 --> 46:00.881
This is an '81 Honda!
How dare you!

46:00.982 --> 46:04.885
You know, most guys I meet try
really hard to impress me.

46:04.986 --> 46:09.122
But there's something
different about you.

46:09.223 --> 46:11.123
It's my tongue.

46:12.627 --> 46:14.561
- Oh my!
- I know.

46:14.662 --> 46:17.832
No, what I was trying
to say is that

46:17.933 --> 46:22.333
with you, it's just effortless.
Easy.

46:27.042 --> 46:32.847
What about you? Drop-dead gorgeous,
totally cool. How does that happen?

46:32.948 --> 46:34.315
I'm serious.

46:34.416 --> 46:37.536
Most girls that are 9's or 10's, you know,
can't even open a door for themself.

46:37.560 --> 46:40.288
They have everything
handed to them.

46:40.389 --> 46:43.489
Not you. You're different.

46:44.293 --> 46:48.863
And you seem to treat everybody the same.
It's really nice.

46:48.964 --> 46:51.964
- Check this out.
- Okay.

46:54.503 --> 46:55.703
Holy shit!

46:56.905 --> 46:59.474
- You have huge ears.
- I know, right?

46:59.575 --> 47:02.475
You have huge ears, Amy!

47:03.045 --> 47:05.947
Gosh, I heard it all
through grade school.

47:06.048 --> 47:09.748
Dumbo. Baby New Year. Big ears.

47:12.221 --> 47:13.221
Wow.

47:13.322 --> 47:15.957
Good thing I don't have a
complex about it or anything.

47:16.058 --> 47:19.394
I'm sorry. It must have been tough.
It must have been tough.

47:19.495 --> 47:21.963
I did go through a lot.

47:22.064 --> 47:25.333
So should I... I should, like, whisper
when I talk to you? I don't wanna...

47:25.434 --> 47:28.834
Shut up! They're not bionic.

47:30.239 --> 47:37.839
No, really, I probably hear even
less because of all this hair.

47:38.046 --> 47:42.046
Well, I like
everything about you.

47:48.657 --> 47:51.159
Come on, we have a few
more stops on the agenda.

47:51.260 --> 47:54.960
- Okay.
- All right, after you.

47:56.331 --> 47:59.500
Oh, you should work for the
government in a think tank.

47:59.601 --> 48:03.001
You call yourself my protege.

48:03.405 --> 48:07.308
- I guess I had you pegged all wrong.
- Really?

48:07.409 --> 48:10.511
All right, well, what was
your first impression of me?

48:10.612 --> 48:15.249
That you were just that guy that has
been skating by for the past 10 years.

48:15.350 --> 48:18.886
Probably still lives
with his mom.

48:18.987 --> 48:23.624
Ouch, me? No. No, no, no, no.
I do not live with my mom.

48:23.725 --> 48:26.661
All right then, let me ask you.

48:26.762 --> 48:30.262
Why are you still a box boy?

48:30.799 --> 48:34.068
There is an answer to that.
But...

48:34.169 --> 48:35.269
But what?

48:39.975 --> 48:45.275
No, it's okay, it's all right.
Just listen.

49:34.463 --> 49:40.868
- Have you ever kissed a boy?
- No. But I have thought about it.

49:40.969 --> 49:41.969
Sir!

49:43.939 --> 49:45.673
- What is it?
- I've got bad news.

49:45.774 --> 49:47.608
Well, spit it out, Dirk.

49:47.709 --> 49:50.778
Apparently, your brother, Glen
Ross, is on his way here.

49:50.879 --> 49:53.581
He wants to do a quick audit.

49:53.682 --> 49:54.882
Jesus! No.

49:56.818 --> 49:57.818
I know.

49:58.887 --> 50:01.787
Okay. Okay. That's fine.

50:01.990 --> 50:03.891
We're fine. Right?

50:03.992 --> 50:07.328
The only problem is that we just
lost Janet on check stand three.

50:07.429 --> 50:11.265
- Her shift is about to begin.
- Where is she? Go find her.

50:11.366 --> 50:13.935
Lost as in dead, sir. She
passed away last night.

50:14.036 --> 50:17.305
So, she's not coming in then?

50:17.406 --> 50:20.206
I don't think so, sir.

50:20.976 --> 50:24.045
Oh, God and Jesus.
Rest her soul.

50:24.146 --> 50:27.615
Call an emergency staff meeting.
Now.

50:27.716 --> 50:30.384
- Don't lollygag!
- Yes, sir.

50:30.485 --> 50:32.920
I've called you in
here for two things.

50:33.021 --> 50:37.458
First of all, the girl on check
stand 13 has passed away.

50:37.559 --> 50:39.439
- Oh, my God, Mary's dead!
- I don't believe it.

50:39.494 --> 50:43.831
- Oh, Lord, why?
- Sir, it's Janet from three.

50:43.932 --> 50:47.532
Sorry, I meant Janet on three.

50:48.170 --> 50:50.872
- Oh, thank God!
- Thank God.

50:50.973 --> 50:55.643
But my big brother, Glen
Ross, is coming in today

50:55.744 --> 50:57.645
- to see how we're all doing.
- Corporate.

50:57.746 --> 51:00.014
And, yes, he can be
very intimidating.

51:00.115 --> 51:03.784
But don't let him get to you.
Do not let him get to you.

51:03.885 --> 51:05.953
It's just his way.

51:06.054 --> 51:10.191
So, we cannot let the lines get
above 25 shoppers. Okay, people?

51:10.292 --> 51:12.126
We really need everybody
to just step it up.

51:12.227 --> 51:15.162
That's impossible. We're short
one checker and it's a Saturday.

51:15.263 --> 51:18.266
Nobody panic. We are out
of options, people.

51:18.367 --> 51:19.867
I'll do it.

51:20.302 --> 51:21.302
Oh, God.

51:21.603 --> 51:23.471
I'll work check
stand number three.

51:23.572 --> 51:26.707
- Is that legal?
- Yeah. Actually he can, yeah.

51:26.808 --> 51:29.777
Great, Zack. We'll toss you
into training immediately.

51:29.878 --> 51:31.679
- You can't be serious.
- Yeah.

51:31.780 --> 51:33.260
He will never be
ready by next shift.

51:33.284 --> 51:36.384
I mean, you can't just walk in off
the street and do what we do.

51:36.485 --> 51:39.005
It takes years and years of training.
I mean, let's just let him

51:39.106 --> 51:41.786
perform a tracheotomy while we're at it.
I mean, this is ridiculous.

51:41.810 --> 51:44.591
I am up against a wall!

51:58.073 --> 52:00.373
Hey, how you doing?

52:19.594 --> 52:21.794
Are you okay, sir? I've never
seen you like this before.

52:21.818 --> 52:25.232
Well, you don't know what it's like,
okay, to come home from school every day

52:25.333 --> 52:28.536
and have your big brother physically
torture you, day in, day out.

52:28.637 --> 52:29.904
It was awful.

52:30.005 --> 52:32.707
- Well, I'm sure he's changed, sir.
- No, he's worse.

52:32.808 --> 52:36.043
He can be so emasculating. And I don't
appreciate you siding with him.

52:36.144 --> 52:37.784
- I'm not siding with him.
- You just did.

52:37.808 --> 52:39.413
- I didn't, sir.
- Well, good.

52:39.514 --> 52:42.783
Bigger smile. Make a note,
old guy should be older.

52:42.884 --> 52:45.184
Straighten that tie.

52:45.787 --> 52:47.887
Get back to work.

52:48.256 --> 52:51.025
- Hello, sir, how are you? Nice to see you.
- Hi. How are you?

52:51.126 --> 52:55.126
Check his receipt
on the way out.

52:56.198 --> 52:59.298
You, grab a rag now. Now!

53:00.702 --> 53:03.938
- Little brother.
- Hey, there.

53:04.039 --> 53:06.807
Bend over. Like you haven't
heard that before.

53:06.908 --> 53:08.752
I really don't think
that it's appropriate...

53:08.776 --> 53:10.644
Come on, get down here.

53:10.745 --> 53:12.646
- Please don't...
- Come on, get down here.

53:12.747 --> 53:16.247
- Please.
- Come on. Come on.

53:18.587 --> 53:21.322
Who's your boss? Who's your boss?
I am, aren't I?

53:21.423 --> 53:23.357
You are. You are.

53:23.458 --> 53:27.128
- Good to see you!
- It's great to see you.

53:27.229 --> 53:28.829
It really is.

53:28.997 --> 53:31.699
So what brings you
in here, so early?

53:31.800 --> 53:33.901
I thought you were only
coming in for the banquet.

53:34.002 --> 53:36.604
I want to make sure you're running
this place up to my standards.

53:36.705 --> 53:40.141
I don't wanna have to
get rid of my own kin.

53:40.242 --> 53:46.447
- Lines look a little long.
- No, no, no. Never more than 25.

53:46.548 --> 53:48.348
Nice to meet...

54:10.238 --> 54:14.008
Damn it! What the
frick is going on?

54:14.109 --> 54:18.012
- I am going over your head.
- Vince.

54:18.113 --> 54:20.815
- I got two.
- Hey, Zack.

54:20.916 --> 54:22.750
Here's your new
cashiers' lounge card.

54:22.851 --> 54:26.754
You just slide it in the machine
and you'll get full access.

54:26.855 --> 54:27.855
Great.

54:29.858 --> 54:32.258
Thanks. Thanks, Dirk.

54:34.563 --> 54:36.163
Slide 'em in.

54:40.769 --> 54:46.073
They gave me one of those stupid
cards with the slide thing.

54:46.174 --> 54:53.474
- Like I'd ever use that.
- Congratulations on the star, man.

55:09.030 --> 55:11.432
- What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

55:11.533 --> 55:13.567
You can't tell the guys
that I shop here, okay?

55:13.668 --> 55:16.470
Because I'm pretty picky
about what I eat.

55:16.571 --> 55:20.341
Zack, honey, I can't seem to find
the Smooth Move laxative tea.

55:20.442 --> 55:23.110
Yeah, it's over in the
disgusting section, Grandma.

55:23.211 --> 55:26.380
You must be the big-eared girl.

55:26.481 --> 55:29.850
- This, Amy, is my beautiful grandmother.
- Nice to meet you.

55:29.951 --> 55:33.187
I'll meet you outside.
Don't be late.

55:33.288 --> 55:38.592
- Boy, is she smoking hot.
- Don't listen, right now, please.

55:38.693 --> 55:40.427
So you don't live
with your mom, huh?

55:40.528 --> 55:43.063
I never said anything
about my grandmother.

55:43.164 --> 55:46.200
Now, can we please finish this
conversation in organic vegetables?

55:46.301 --> 55:47.301
Yeah.

55:51.139 --> 55:54.608
Ten years ago, I had a
start-up, a dot-com.

55:54.709 --> 56:00.781
And I had a computer, I had a product,
I even had a PO box at Mail Boxes Etc.

56:00.882 --> 56:03.217
- You? Come on.
- I know, right.

56:03.318 --> 56:08.656
I was a hotshot straight out of college,
and I thought I knew everything,

56:08.757 --> 56:11.592
- but, boy, was I wrong.
- What happened?

56:11.693 --> 56:14.528
Borrowed a lot of money to get it
started, and then I lost it all.

56:14.629 --> 56:16.330
People know there's a risk.

56:16.431 --> 56:19.867
Except for my grandmother, who
didn't have the money to risk.

56:19.968 --> 56:23.504
That's why she kind
of lives with me now.

56:23.605 --> 56:26.974
After that I thought I'd do something
with a little less responsibility.

56:27.075 --> 56:30.377
You know, something that wouldn't
jeopardize anybody's future.

56:30.478 --> 56:32.378
Except your own.

56:34.015 --> 56:36.550
Yeah, thanks, Dr. Phyllis.
I get your point.

56:36.651 --> 56:39.353
Zacky, what's my PIN number?

56:39.454 --> 56:43.457
1-2-3-4, Grandma. Now we
got to change it again.

56:43.558 --> 56:48.195
Anyway, I got to get going.
I'll see you later.

56:48.296 --> 56:50.396
- See you.
- Bye.

56:51.032 --> 56:53.332
I'm a professional.

56:55.804 --> 56:58.604
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

56:59.574 --> 57:03.074
six, five, four, three, two...

57:09.484 --> 57:11.384
It's free then.

57:11.519 --> 57:13.020
We're going to need
some insurance...

57:13.121 --> 57:14.955
- That's not good.
- Yeah. Should I help him?

57:15.056 --> 57:18.056
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Okay.

57:50.458 --> 57:52.858
Are you okay, Vince?

57:54.195 --> 58:00.495
Am I losing it? What could
she possibly see in him?

58:00.935 --> 58:04.305
Well, apparently they
have a lot in common.

58:04.406 --> 58:06.774
And they even finish
each other's sentences.

58:06.875 --> 58:10.475
What? Where did you hear this?

58:11.579 --> 58:16.817
Why haven't you told me about this?
I knew it had to be something.

58:16.918 --> 58:20.118
Everybody knows, home slice.

58:22.424 --> 58:28.524
Well, I'm going to have
to turn this up a notch.

58:32.100 --> 58:37.204
Push, push, push. I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

58:37.305 --> 58:39.705
- Boss?
- I got it.

58:41.743 --> 58:43.743
Save your energy.

58:44.479 --> 58:49.183
Don't cry, okay? I'll
cry for you, okay?

58:49.284 --> 58:52.884
Get someone who speaks English.

59:07.635 --> 59:11.205
Oh, hey. I didn't see
you sitting there.

59:11.306 --> 59:13.706
- You didn't?
- No.

59:14.042 --> 59:20.842
Oh, my God, we ordered the same thing.
How serendipitous.

59:24.386 --> 59:28.986
- How are you?
- Good. It's all good.

59:29.891 --> 59:31.691
All right, well, my break's
over, so I'm gonna

59:31.715 --> 59:34.528
- take off.
- Take a dump?

59:34.629 --> 59:39.033
- Excuse me?
- Nothing. I didn't say anything.

59:39.134 --> 59:41.635
- Are you feeling all right?
- All... Okay?

59:41.736 --> 59:45.336
Jinx, you owe me a Coke or...

59:46.808 --> 59:49.410
- You can't talk till I...
- What?

59:49.511 --> 59:51.012
- It's a jinx.
- Bye.

59:51.113 --> 59:54.215
Buy low, sell high. That's
not what you were gonna say.

59:54.316 --> 59:57.685
- I'll see you later.
- See you later, alligator.

59:57.786 --> 59:58.786
Okay.

01:00:11.867 --> 01:00:15.036
What are we gonna do then? My
brother is gonna flip out.

01:00:15.137 --> 01:00:17.171
You gotta find a place
to put those pallets.

01:00:17.272 --> 01:00:20.112
I've checked the entire store, sir.
There isn't room available anywhere.

01:00:20.136 --> 01:00:23.811
We can't afford to send these back, okay?
It will kill our margins.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.072
You don't have a big brother.

01:00:25.113 --> 01:00:28.033
You don't know what it's like getting
hit in the shins with a little cane.

01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.284
I have a little sister, sir,
and she can be very cruel.

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:32.119
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

01:00:32.220 --> 01:00:36.590
Hey, guys. How many pallets
are we talking about?

01:00:36.691 --> 01:00:38.926
Well, where the hell is he?

01:00:39.027 --> 01:00:43.898
You know, we can't keep playing Texas
Hold 'Em with three. It sucks.

01:00:43.999 --> 01:00:46.667
- Cashiers have different break times.
- Yeah, well, it sucks.

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:49.203
I think he's gone to
the dark side, guys.

01:00:49.304 --> 01:00:53.504
- He wouldn't do that.
- It sucks.

01:00:53.742 --> 01:00:55.542
- What?
- Okay.

01:00:57.012 --> 01:01:00.181
There's only four people in the
world that know about this place.

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:02.216
And I don't think either
one of us did this.

01:01:02.317 --> 01:01:07.021
- So, who's the odd man out, huh?
- Sucky Zack.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:14.522
He wouldn't do it on purpose, guys.
This is his lounge, too.

01:01:16.598 --> 01:01:17.998
Not anymore.

01:01:18.333 --> 01:01:20.701
- What, is it Zack?
- Check it out, eight balls.

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:26.302
- Tell me it's not Zack.
- I said it's him.

01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:31.109
I knew it. He sucks ass.

01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.180
Hey, what's up?

01:01:33.248 --> 01:01:35.349
I have plans for tonight,
if you're interested.

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:36.450
Love to.

01:01:36.551 --> 01:01:38.511
All right, I'll pick you
up at your place at 9:30.

01:01:38.535 --> 01:01:41.035
- Okay, cool.
- Okay.

01:01:46.561 --> 01:01:47.661
Excellent.

01:01:49.497 --> 01:01:52.397
Hey, buddy, take a seat.

01:01:53.468 --> 01:01:54.468
Welcome.

01:01:55.437 --> 01:01:58.237
I won't bite. Come on.

01:02:00.508 --> 01:02:02.808
- Nice, huh?
- Yes.

01:02:03.178 --> 01:02:06.447
Downright decadent. You know,
the soda machine's free.

01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:09.350
Yeah, yeah, I heard about that.
That's amazing.

01:02:09.451 --> 01:02:11.519
Please, have a drink.

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:16.123
Yeah, yeah, thank you. Thanks very much.
Look at this, no dents.

01:02:16.224 --> 01:02:17.724
Not in here.

01:02:19.794 --> 01:02:21.894
Nice, huh? Cheers.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.530
Oh, boy.

01:02:24.099 --> 01:02:28.235
Look at us here, just a couple of
soldiers on the field of battle.

01:02:28.336 --> 01:02:31.772
Sitting here like a couple
of old gay sailors.

01:02:31.873 --> 01:02:33.340
What are we doing?

01:02:33.441 --> 01:02:37.578
I'll tell you what. Let's, you and
I, put our differences behind us.

01:02:37.679 --> 01:02:42.850
You back off, I win E of M.
I get my car. Malibu.

01:02:42.951 --> 01:02:45.770
I get the girl, I
get the promotion.

01:02:45.871 --> 01:02:48.272
When they buck me up
to assistant manager,

01:02:48.373 --> 01:02:53.044
I'm gonna do you a solid.
I'll let you keep your job.

01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:55.145
What do you say?

01:03:00.152 --> 01:03:02.552
Thanks for the Coke.

01:03:04.422 --> 01:03:06.757
Well, I've got something
to say to you.

01:03:06.858 --> 01:03:10.027
Nobody is going to stand in
the way of me and my Malibu.

01:03:10.128 --> 01:03:12.229
Not a wall of fire.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:16.367
And as for butter buns, she's all mine.
So you can forget about that.

01:03:16.468 --> 01:03:20.805
- And does Jorge know about her?
- Jorge's none of your business.

01:03:20.906 --> 01:03:22.426
Who do you think she'd
rather be with?

01:03:22.450 --> 01:03:26.310
Some little lowly box boy who fell
ass-backwards into a job title,

01:03:26.411 --> 01:03:29.380
or King Dick, head
cashier and winner

01:03:29.481 --> 01:03:31.916
of the south-west regional
speed ring competition?

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:34.785
Let me think about that for a second.
Hmm. I would say...

01:03:34.886 --> 01:03:37.598
The answer is me. Head
cashier, smart-ass.

01:03:37.622 --> 01:03:40.357
I wouldn't be too sure
about that, Vince.

01:03:40.458 --> 01:03:45.229
I got bad news, bro. Game over.
I'd watch my back if I was you.

01:03:45.330 --> 01:03:47.098
- Were.
- What?

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:50.299
- "Were you."
- Watch out.

01:04:08.485 --> 01:04:09.585
Hey, guy.

01:04:10.553 --> 01:04:12.821
What the hell happened
to our lounge, man?

01:04:12.922 --> 01:04:14.682
I know what you guys are
thinking, all right?

01:04:14.706 --> 01:04:17.226
But I'm three days away
from winning this thing.

01:04:17.327 --> 01:04:19.538
I just gotta do what it takes, all right?
Small sacrifices.

01:04:19.562 --> 01:04:21.202
If I put some cheese
up in the clubhouse,

01:04:21.303 --> 01:04:23.063
you guys got to suck it
up for a little bit.

01:04:23.087 --> 01:04:26.001
You know, it's just a temporary thing.
You with me, yes?

01:04:26.102 --> 01:04:28.003
Trust, is it right there?

01:04:28.104 --> 01:04:30.144
This is what I'm thinking.
At the end of this thing,

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:32.113
if it goes the way I
think it's gonna go,

01:04:32.214 --> 01:04:35.744
I'm gonna be able to get
you guys into that lounge.

01:04:35.845 --> 01:04:37.845
I know it. Cool?

01:04:38.982 --> 01:04:41.517
I can see it. It's cool.
All right.

01:04:41.618 --> 01:04:42.618
Ass.

01:04:52.662 --> 01:04:54.162
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:04:54.564 --> 01:04:59.464
- You look nice.
- Thank you. So do you.

01:05:02.472 --> 01:05:05.240
Clear. Come on. Come on.

01:05:05.341 --> 01:05:07.676
- Do you know the plan?
- Si. Got it.

01:05:07.777 --> 01:05:08.777
Okay.

01:05:11.181 --> 01:05:15.584
- What is that smell?
- It smells funny. I don't know.

01:05:15.685 --> 01:05:19.385
- Oh, God, did you fart?
- No.

01:05:22.759 --> 01:05:30.759
- Where did you get these pantyhose?
- I got it from my mom's gym bag.

01:05:44.514 --> 01:05:48.114
- Did you get them all?
- Si.

01:05:48.251 --> 01:05:53.388
- What are you eating?
- I don't know. It's like a salmon churro.

01:05:53.489 --> 01:05:58.489
- It's rancid.
- It's pretty good, homes.

01:06:05.602 --> 01:06:12.502
What are you doing? There are
no weapons in this mission.

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:25.420
I will not do time for you.
I will roll over on you.

01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:30.893
You said you were a Mexican,
not a Puerto Rican.

01:06:30.994 --> 01:06:33.095
Thanks again. I
had a lot of fun.

01:06:33.196 --> 01:06:36.064
Yeah, I did... Did, too.

01:06:36.165 --> 01:06:38.700
I didn't know anybody really
ever won these things.

01:06:38.801 --> 01:06:41.346
Well, I've tossed a lot
of dimes in my day.

01:06:41.370 --> 01:06:43.939
I bet you have.

01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:47.940
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

01:06:48.044 --> 01:06:49.244
All right.

01:06:53.383 --> 01:06:56.383
- All right.
- All right.

01:06:59.389 --> 01:07:02.089
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

01:07:23.179 --> 01:07:25.979
What? No! No! No! Shit!

01:07:29.252 --> 01:07:31.652
Twelve minutes! Shit!

01:07:40.296 --> 01:07:41.296
Vince.

01:07:47.003 --> 01:07:53.603
Oh, I love the smell of a
championship in the morning.

01:08:00.416 --> 01:08:04.219
Have you guys seen
Zack this morning?

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.121
- What?
- Nothing.

01:08:06.222 --> 01:08:11.422
We haven't seen box boy
Zack this morning.

01:08:19.502 --> 01:08:23.301
Move. Move. Move.
Coming through.

01:08:23.673 --> 01:08:24.872
Excuse me.

01:08:26.509 --> 01:08:29.009
Too close. Too close.

01:08:38.354 --> 01:08:39.354
Move!

01:09:29.906 --> 01:09:32.406
Is that all you got?

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:40.549
Where's my card? Where...

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:41.649
No. No.

01:09:43.453 --> 01:09:46.653
Yes! It's over. Of course.

01:09:47.523 --> 01:09:48.723
Hey, Zack.

01:09:49.926 --> 01:09:53.662
Mikhal's championship
game is this Friday.

01:09:53.763 --> 01:09:55.363
On it, Iqbal.

01:10:01.971 --> 01:10:05.471
- You are...
- Right on time.

01:10:06.742 --> 01:10:08.742
Thank you, Iqbal.

01:10:08.945 --> 01:10:09.945
No!

01:10:13.249 --> 01:10:16.318
It's a large item. I'll
have someone bring it up.

01:10:16.419 --> 01:10:18.687
It's a great shirt.

01:10:18.788 --> 01:10:21.288
There you are. Radio.

01:10:21.824 --> 01:10:24.159
Check stand one. We've
got a bulk item.

01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:26.995
"Piece o' shit
Honda" on aisle 116.

01:10:27.096 --> 01:10:28.096
On it.

01:10:29.966 --> 01:10:33.201
Vince, I think you're
gonna wanna see this.

01:10:33.302 --> 01:10:36.902
Watch the stand for me, Jorge.

01:10:40.877 --> 01:10:43.178
What kind of a sick animal?

01:10:43.279 --> 01:10:45.614
God damn it. Someone
get this down.

01:10:45.715 --> 01:10:49.584
- Is there a problem here?
- Yeah, that is my car.

01:10:49.685 --> 01:10:52.054
No, no, no, I bought it.
Here is my receipt.

01:10:52.155 --> 01:10:54.489
The only thing that you own
is that crazy Hawaiian shirt.

01:10:54.590 --> 01:10:55.957
This is my vehicle.

01:10:56.058 --> 01:11:02.558
Hey, I need to see a manager right now!
Where is he?

01:11:11.207 --> 01:11:16.078
Technically, if it's on the rack and in the
system, we're required to sell it to him.

01:11:16.179 --> 01:11:22.479
If we don't, he's threatening
to write a complaint.

01:11:31.494 --> 01:11:33.994
- Fine.
- I'm sorry.

01:11:42.305 --> 01:11:50.305
Sometimes third gear sticks a little.
You gotta give it a little wiggle.

01:11:51.247 --> 01:11:53.547
I... Oh, all right.

01:11:57.954 --> 01:12:00.455
I can't believe you sold
your wheels to that dude.

01:12:00.556 --> 01:12:02.958
- You promised.
- I had to.

01:12:03.059 --> 01:12:07.496
And for $9,980 less than what
you would have charged me?

01:12:07.597 --> 01:12:13.602
If I didn't, he was going to write me up.
One complaint, I'm out of the game.

01:12:13.703 --> 01:12:16.003
I'm sorry, wingman.

01:12:16.606 --> 01:12:20.106
I'm not your wingman anymore.

01:12:23.112 --> 01:12:25.514
You can't be serious.

01:12:25.615 --> 01:12:29.915
You're nothing without me.
You're...

01:12:37.026 --> 01:12:39.794
Yeah, baby. Read 'em and weep.

01:12:39.895 --> 01:12:44.733
Looks like somebody's
gonna need a ride home.

01:12:44.834 --> 01:12:48.134
Well, well, well, 15 to 14.

01:12:50.206 --> 01:12:52.641
You gave me a pretty good
run back there, buddy.

01:12:52.742 --> 01:12:54.643
But tomorrow is the last day.

01:12:54.744 --> 01:12:58.880
When I step out onto that softball
field, pop a couple dingers,

01:12:58.981 --> 01:13:02.484
it's going to be celebration
time in my new Malibu.

01:13:02.585 --> 01:13:07.556
Well, Vince, you know what they say.
It ain't over till your mama sings.

01:13:07.657 --> 01:13:12.357
Bad news, guy. Mama
don't sing at all.

01:13:13.796 --> 01:13:14.796
Face.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:21.803
As you know, Corporate, a.k.a.
My big brother, Glen Ross,

01:13:21.904 --> 01:13:23.405
will be attending the game.

01:13:23.506 --> 01:13:27.075
So, it's very important
to me and to all of you

01:13:27.176 --> 01:13:29.778
that we beat Maxi-Mart today.

01:13:29.879 --> 01:13:33.181
- And, since the passing of...
- Janet.

01:13:33.282 --> 01:13:39.854
Janet, we are in dire need and
could really use an outfielder.

01:13:39.955 --> 01:13:44.055
Anyone? Anyone. An
outfielder, so...

01:13:46.028 --> 01:13:47.928
Anyone? Somebody?

01:13:49.198 --> 01:13:53.301
Anyone at all? Some...
Zack Bradley.

01:13:53.402 --> 01:13:55.503
- You're our guy.
- Yeah.

01:13:55.604 --> 01:13:57.105
- Okay. That's good.
- Yes.

01:13:57.206 --> 01:14:02.706
Okay. All right. Everybody,
be safe out there.

01:14:02.812 --> 01:14:04.412
Wish me luck.

01:14:06.315 --> 01:14:10.919
- Hey, hey, Zack. What are you doing?
- I'm going to the softball game.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:13.755
You were going to cover for me.
Mikhal's game, remember?

01:14:13.856 --> 01:14:16.324
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:14:16.425 --> 01:14:19.325
But it's a championship.

01:14:22.431 --> 01:14:24.232
- I got it.
- You sure?

01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:26.334
- Yeah, I'm cool.
- You're a good friend.

01:14:26.435 --> 01:14:27.435
Thanks.

01:14:28.237 --> 01:14:30.037
All right, bud.

01:14:35.344 --> 01:14:37.944
35, 36, 37, 38, 39...

01:14:43.786 --> 01:14:47.088
Damn it. Why are
our uniforms pink?

01:14:47.189 --> 01:14:49.991
We accidentally washed
them with the red socks.

01:14:50.092 --> 01:14:52.594
Play ball. Super Club,
take the field!

01:14:52.695 --> 01:14:53.795
- Take the field!
- Oh, no.

01:14:53.896 --> 01:14:58.996
Seven, eight, nine... Dang it!
We're short.

01:14:59.101 --> 01:15:01.770
You know, I didn't mean that.
We're... You know...

01:15:01.871 --> 01:15:05.373
I meant, where is Zack? Please
don't point the stick at me.

01:15:05.474 --> 01:15:10.374
- I'm gonna call Mom.
- Don't call Mom.

01:15:23.626 --> 01:15:28.426
Look alive out there,
for Christ's sake!

01:15:29.698 --> 01:15:30.865
No batter! No batter!

01:15:30.966 --> 01:15:38.866
Act like you've held a stick that
big before. You know you have.

01:15:39.742 --> 01:15:41.810
What do you call that?

01:15:41.911 --> 01:15:43.378
I call that my best.

01:15:43.479 --> 01:15:45.814
And I heard you out there,
and I didn't appreciate it.

01:15:45.915 --> 01:15:47.615
Just get back.

01:15:49.552 --> 01:15:50.752
Who's up?

01:15:59.128 --> 01:16:01.228
I'm out of here.

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:05.700
Renfroe, looking good.

01:16:05.801 --> 01:16:09.871
Looking real good. Nice.
Super good.

01:16:09.972 --> 01:16:11.773
Put it in his curve tank, buddy.
Come on.

01:16:11.874 --> 01:16:15.974
- Come on, Jorge.
- Come on, baby.

01:16:22.685 --> 01:16:24.125
That's what I'm
talking about, Zack.

01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:25.660
Pull your head out
of your ass, ump!

01:16:25.684 --> 01:16:30.384
It hit the ground.
The ball's no good!

01:16:35.931 --> 01:16:39.531
That's right! Way to go! Yes!

01:16:41.003 --> 01:16:46.303
This is baloney! Check
the bat, it's corked!

01:16:53.682 --> 01:16:59.854
Here we go, boys. We're down by a few.
Only down by a few. We can do this.

01:16:59.955 --> 01:17:01.955
Not in my house.

01:17:02.224 --> 01:17:03.825
Nice, Glen Gary. Nice.

01:17:03.926 --> 01:17:07.726
Yes, come on! Way to come back!

01:17:10.599 --> 01:17:13.535
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

01:17:13.636 --> 01:17:15.336
Shut up, Mary.

01:17:16.071 --> 01:17:18.971
Why won't you trust me?

01:17:22.978 --> 01:17:24.378
You're out!

01:17:25.314 --> 01:17:28.183
- What? Are you kidding me?
- I said you're out!

01:17:28.284 --> 01:17:31.119
- What are you talking about?
- Can't you hear me, you're out!

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.189
Iqbal, please report
to Electronics.

01:17:34.290 --> 01:17:37.590
Iqbal to Electronics, please.

01:17:39.262 --> 01:17:44.462
Come on, guys, just got
to hold them here.

01:17:44.667 --> 01:17:49.604
You work for me. Get
out there and get it.

01:17:49.705 --> 01:17:52.174
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Time.

01:17:52.275 --> 01:17:57.212
What? Time out? Can we please
respect the sanctity of this game?

01:17:57.313 --> 01:18:01.183
Everybody take a knee.
Hop down here.

01:18:01.284 --> 01:18:02.651
Grab a knee, come on.

01:18:02.752 --> 01:18:06.052
All right, we can win this.

01:18:06.555 --> 01:18:09.257
And we can win this the
Super Club way, okay?

01:18:09.358 --> 01:18:11.398
And until today, I didn't
even know what that meant.

01:18:11.422 --> 01:18:14.763
In fact, I still don't,
but I do know this.

01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:18.066
We're a team out here.
I mean, look at us.

01:18:18.139 --> 01:18:20.779
Glen Ross, I thought you were going
to be a stuffed shirt out here.

01:18:20.803 --> 01:18:22.971
The way you took down that
catcher, are you kidding me?

01:18:23.072 --> 01:18:25.273
You're the balls, man! You're
the balls and the taint.

01:18:25.374 --> 01:18:26.741
You're that whole region.

01:18:26.842 --> 01:18:28.911
And you, I don't even know
you on a personal level,

01:18:29.012 --> 01:18:31.814
but you sign off on my paychecks.
That's a good thing.

01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:35.684
Amy, you're wonderful.
Don't change a thing.

01:18:35.785 --> 01:18:37.753
Glen Gary, you got us
pink uniforms, yes,

01:18:37.854 --> 01:18:40.189
but, you know what?
That's what unites us.

01:18:40.290 --> 01:18:41.957
These uniforms unite us,

01:18:42.058 --> 01:18:44.827
because we are all pink
on the inside, right?

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:48.528
Yeah, we're pink like vaginas.

01:18:51.835 --> 01:18:55.071
Good guess, Vince.
We're Super Club.

01:18:55.172 --> 01:18:58.340
- Where buying in bulk is what?
- Our God-given right!

01:18:58.441 --> 01:19:02.141
- Let's win this game!
- Yeah!

01:19:03.380 --> 01:19:06.582
Come on, guys, two outs. We're up by one.
We just got to hold them right here.

01:19:06.683 --> 01:19:09.785
You all better get your umbrellas
out because there's a storm coming.

01:19:09.886 --> 01:19:13.786
Come on, Jorge, give it to them!

01:19:31.942 --> 01:19:33.142
I got it.

01:20:03.106 --> 01:20:06.442
- Okay, people!
- Quiet down, everybody!

01:20:06.543 --> 01:20:10.246
Let's get down to business.
Okay.

01:20:10.347 --> 01:20:12.548
Thank you, Zack, for
coming through for us.

01:20:12.649 --> 01:20:13.849
- A sweet victory.
- Yeah.

01:20:13.950 --> 01:20:16.285
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, yeah!

01:20:16.386 --> 01:20:18.186
Good job, Zack.

01:20:18.855 --> 01:20:21.790
What this means is a tie
for employee of the month,

01:20:21.891 --> 01:20:24.994
which has never
happened before, ever.

01:20:25.095 --> 01:20:26.735
Now, we've decided
tomorrow at the banquet

01:20:26.763 --> 01:20:30.299
we're going to have a check stand ring-off.
Winner take all.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.603
Now back to work. Be safe out there.
Nice job.

01:20:34.704 --> 01:20:38.304
Thank you. Nice job! Nice job!

01:20:55.325 --> 01:20:58.125
I can't do this alone.

01:20:59.663 --> 01:21:02.063
I'm gonna need you.

01:21:03.500 --> 01:21:05.600
Please. Come home.

01:21:16.279 --> 01:21:20.316
I'm gonna need some
time to think.

01:21:20.417 --> 01:21:22.717
I understand. I do.

01:21:25.221 --> 01:21:29.721
I'm gonna give you
your space, homes.

01:21:57.120 --> 01:22:00.422
I did it. I did it.
I tied it up.

01:22:00.523 --> 01:22:04.159
I tied it up. What's going on?

01:22:04.260 --> 01:22:06.528
- They fired him.
- Why?

01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:09.832
Apparently, Action Media did a
special on dirty electricity,

01:22:09.933 --> 01:22:14.403
and there was a mad rush on power strips
while he was at Mogala's soccer game.

01:22:14.504 --> 01:22:17.906
- But I was...
- You were supposed to cover for me.

01:22:18.007 --> 01:22:19.275
We had a deal.

01:22:19.376 --> 01:22:21.810
Okay, now wait a minute, all
right, I was taking your advice.

01:22:21.911 --> 01:22:22.978
Taking pride in my work.

01:22:23.079 --> 01:22:29.918
But that is a little bit harder when
I'm taking pride in your work, too.

01:22:30.019 --> 01:22:37.860
- Wait a minute. Let me just say something.
- I think you've done enough, guy.

01:22:37.961 --> 01:22:41.361
I can see right through you.

01:22:43.967 --> 01:22:45.167
Hey, Zack.

01:22:45.268 --> 01:22:50.539
We're taking all the cashiers out to
the Steaksmith. Come on, let's go.

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:51.640
Come on.

01:22:54.444 --> 01:22:58.847
You made me so proud out there today.
Come on.

01:22:58.948 --> 01:23:01.617
- Look at him.
- No, don't.

01:23:01.718 --> 01:23:03.519
He's at the big boys' table.

01:23:03.620 --> 01:23:04.620
Vince.

01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:07.656
Didn't realize it was going to
be such a competition for you.

01:23:07.757 --> 01:23:09.992
You're like a skilled surgeon
behind that register.

01:23:10.093 --> 01:23:11.133
You guys seen his counter?

01:23:11.227 --> 01:23:13.929
Not a speck of dust, not a
single tool out of place.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:19.501
- I guess I can get a little anal.
- Actually, I hear he gets a lot.

01:23:19.602 --> 01:23:21.802
Now, that's funny!

01:23:22.005 --> 01:23:24.506
Hey, why don't we send the
little lady to get some drinks?

01:23:24.607 --> 01:23:26.909
I don't think that Amy appreciates
you referring to her...

01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:30.510
I'm talking about you, Nancy.

01:23:30.814 --> 01:23:34.283
- It's okay, I'll go.
- Thank you, sweetheart.

01:23:34.384 --> 01:23:35.384
Oh, boy.

01:23:35.718 --> 01:23:38.754
Hey, I read that
girl's personal file.

01:23:38.855 --> 01:23:43.992
I hear she only likes to go after
the employee of the month.

01:23:44.093 --> 01:23:45.293
Excuse me.

01:23:47.130 --> 01:23:48.797
What's up, fellas?

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:53.302
I don't know who threw the lime,
but that was a good shot.

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:55.771
Check it out, Iqbal.
Listen to this.

01:23:55.872 --> 01:23:59.174
I know you got fired, but I'm getting
in pretty tight with management now,

01:23:59.275 --> 01:24:01.877
and I think that I could
turn this thing around.

01:24:01.978 --> 01:24:05.280
That's it? You're in
tight with management?

01:24:05.381 --> 01:24:08.384
You used to be tight with
us, with your friends.

01:24:08.485 --> 01:24:10.753
You used to be someone
we could count on.

01:24:10.854 --> 01:24:14.590
Not anymore. I'm sick and tired
of sticking up for you, Zack.

01:24:14.691 --> 01:24:16.525
Yeah, what happened to you, man?

01:24:16.626 --> 01:24:19.495
You're like the drummer
from REO Speedwagon.

01:24:19.596 --> 01:24:21.697
Nobody knows who you are.

01:24:21.798 --> 01:24:24.266
You're becoming one of them.
You're turning into Vince.

01:24:24.367 --> 01:24:28.604
- Wait a second. I am not like Vince.
- No, you're worse.

01:24:28.705 --> 01:24:31.006
At least Vince isn't
pretending to be an asshole.

01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:32.107
But you,

01:24:32.308 --> 01:24:35.677
you're pretending to be one of them
just so you can get into Amy's pants.

01:24:35.778 --> 01:24:37.578
Step off, okay?

01:24:38.381 --> 01:24:40.916
The Zack we know wouldn't
have sold out his friends

01:24:41.017 --> 01:24:44.720
just because some
slinky-ass blond tart

01:24:44.821 --> 01:24:48.257
would sleep with the
employee of the month.

01:24:48.358 --> 01:24:50.558
So, just step off.

01:24:54.364 --> 01:24:55.964
Is that true?

01:25:02.972 --> 01:25:04.072
Hey, Amy.

01:25:05.275 --> 01:25:08.075
Is that the blond tart?

01:25:09.712 --> 01:25:11.712
Did she hear me?

01:25:13.616 --> 01:25:16.016
Amy, Amy, wait. Amy.

01:25:16.886 --> 01:25:18.766
You actually thought that
I would sleep with you

01:25:18.855 --> 01:25:25.255
if you won employee of the month?
Who told you that?

01:25:26.195 --> 01:25:28.395
Your personal file.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:31.800
I see.

01:25:32.268 --> 01:25:36.004
So that's why you've been
working so hard, huh?

01:25:36.105 --> 01:25:38.205
No. Yes. Kind of.

01:25:41.344 --> 01:25:46.281
I heard that, and then I
saw you with Vince, and...

01:25:46.382 --> 01:25:48.717
- I thought you were different, Zack.
- Amy...

01:25:48.818 --> 01:25:51.787
You want to know if I screwed the
employee of the month at my last job?

01:25:51.888 --> 01:25:53.932
No.

01:25:53.956 --> 01:25:56.024
Well, I did. But he was
also my boyfriend,

01:25:56.125 --> 01:26:01.129
and a lying, conniving,
asshole-user, just like you.

01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:05.701
You employees of the
months are all the same.

01:26:05.802 --> 01:26:06.902
Amy. Amy.

01:27:24.514 --> 01:27:30.252
Why aren't you dressed for work?
Isn't today the big day?

01:27:30.353 --> 01:27:32.353
- I quit.
- Why?

01:27:33.189 --> 01:27:39.328
I screwed up, Grams. Amy hates me.
My friends hate me.

01:27:39.429 --> 01:27:42.264
Everybody's right about me.
I'm a loser.

01:27:42.365 --> 01:27:44.276
Well, you're certainly
dressed for the part.

01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:46.234
Thanks, Grams.

01:27:46.335 --> 01:27:50.572
You know that loser that lost
all my retirement money?

01:27:50.673 --> 01:27:55.273
Well, at least that
guy actually tried.

01:27:55.678 --> 01:27:59.578
I'll take the old Zack any day.

01:28:08.291 --> 01:28:11.526
Wow, it's only been a day.

01:28:11.627 --> 01:28:13.727
You look terrible.

01:28:14.163 --> 01:28:17.699
- Are the boys in there?
- Yeah. Guys.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:18.800
Go play.

01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:30.212
- What are you doing here, guy?
- Just hear me out, all right, guys?

01:28:30.313 --> 01:28:34.249
I'm sorry for what happened, and
I apologize for my behavior.

01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:36.451
I forgot who my
real friends are.

01:28:36.552 --> 01:28:40.989
Iqbal, I talked to Glen and
I gave my resignation.

01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:43.525
I took full responsibility
for what happened.

01:28:43.626 --> 01:28:45.460
You got your job back.

01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:48.597
- I don't want the job back.
- What?

01:28:48.698 --> 01:28:50.658
Turns out me getting fired
gave Humera the courage

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.869
to demand a promotion last night.
I'm a stay-at-home Daddy now.

01:28:53.970 --> 01:28:59.470
Can you believe it? I
should be thanking you.

01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:03.070
You know, Iqbal, you said
something the other day,

01:29:03.094 --> 01:29:06.448
and you were right. The
universe has a plan.

01:29:06.549 --> 01:29:08.417
I'm going to win
that competition.

01:29:08.518 --> 01:29:09.995
And I'm not going to do it
for employee of the month,

01:29:10.019 --> 01:29:11.499
I'm not going to do
it to beat Vince,

01:29:11.523 --> 01:29:14.589
I'm not even going to do it for Amy.
I'm going to do it for myself.

01:29:14.690 --> 01:29:18.490
For pride. But I need you guys.

01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.395
Are you with me?

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:25.333
We never went anywhere.

01:29:25.434 --> 01:29:30.372
Yeah, but wait a minute, Zack.
You just said you quit.

01:29:30.473 --> 01:29:32.407
Yeah, that does pose a
problem, doesn't it?

01:29:32.508 --> 01:29:36.008
Hey, we got you covered, guy.

01:29:36.245 --> 01:29:41.445
Nothing a little broken
chocolate won't fix.

01:29:41.651 --> 01:29:43.151
Thanks, guys.

01:30:01.938 --> 01:30:03.638
Hey, watch it.

01:30:07.543 --> 01:30:08.943
Nice wheels.

01:30:18.721 --> 01:30:21.456
- I'll come back on one condition.
- Name it.

01:30:21.557 --> 01:30:25.527
You give me full access
to the cashiers' lounge.

01:30:25.628 --> 01:30:26.628
Done.

01:30:30.833 --> 01:30:34.233
It's good to have you back.

01:30:36.672 --> 01:30:39.072
It just feels right.

01:30:40.676 --> 01:30:41.676
Okay.

01:30:45.948 --> 01:30:47.248
Home slice.

01:30:48.985 --> 01:30:50.585
You can do it, boss.

01:30:50.686 --> 01:30:55.056
You know, we're like shampoo
and conditioner, you know.

01:30:55.157 --> 01:31:02.557
We're like ham and cheese. We're
like bread and pumpernickel.

01:31:05.701 --> 01:31:11.339
So, I heard about you and Zack.
I am so sorry.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.511
The guys who cut corners
cannot be trusted.

01:31:16.612 --> 01:31:22.384
But I want you to know something. I'm
willing to fight to save our relationship.

01:31:22.485 --> 01:31:25.921
I hope you are, too,
because I love you.

01:31:26.022 --> 01:31:27.022
Face.

01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:34.429
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have to go defend your honor.

01:31:34.530 --> 01:31:38.099
Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?

01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.936
I have a sad announcement.

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:43.672
Zack Bradley quit this morning.

01:31:43.773 --> 01:31:45.373
Yes! Come on!

01:31:47.543 --> 01:31:52.743
So, it looks as if Vince
is going to be...

01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:20.709
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:25.247
No, he already quit, you said.
And everyone heard and then...

01:32:25.348 --> 01:32:30.019
Technically, the papers
were never filed.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:32.721
Oh, my goodness, you sold
yourself for a candy bar?

01:32:32.822 --> 01:32:35.057
Is that true? Is
he still employed?

01:32:35.158 --> 01:32:36.158
How could you?

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:38.027
Put that chocolate bar
down and do your job.

01:32:38.128 --> 01:32:39.595
Let's get this party started.

01:32:39.696 --> 01:32:44.700
All right. Okay. Now we're talking. It's
a virtual tie for employee of the month.

01:32:44.801 --> 01:32:46.836
Today's work will
determine the winner.

01:32:46.937 --> 01:32:50.272
Now, we've placed the exact same
amount of product in each cart,

01:32:50.373 --> 01:32:53.909
along with a curveball or two.
Oh, it's gonna be fun.

01:32:54.010 --> 01:33:00.510
So whoever has the fastest
ring rate will win it all.

01:33:02.953 --> 01:33:05.653
Juan, give me the gun.

01:33:06.389 --> 01:33:07.989
Give me that.

01:33:09.426 --> 01:33:12.127
Listen, I know you have
every reason to hate me.

01:33:12.228 --> 01:33:15.428
I lied, and I regret that,

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.701
because I was that slacker who
lived with his grandmother,

01:33:18.802 --> 01:33:20.903
and had everybody
do his job for him.

01:33:21.004 --> 01:33:23.405
So I wanted to apologize
and I want to thank you.

01:33:23.506 --> 01:33:24.606
Thank me?

01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:32.909
Because if it wasn't for you,
Amy, I'd still be that guy.

01:33:33.483 --> 01:33:34.550
All right, let's do this.

01:33:34.651 --> 01:33:36.151
Put it back.

01:33:36.586 --> 01:33:39.488
Oh, wait, wait, wait. I need
somebody to box for me.

01:33:39.589 --> 01:33:42.057
Okay, you know what? I'll do it.

01:33:42.158 --> 01:33:45.394
Come on. Come on, dingle
eyes, take a left.

01:33:45.495 --> 01:33:47.096
Hey, man. Thanks, brother.

01:33:47.197 --> 01:33:51.197
Okay, everyone, be
safe out there.

01:33:51.368 --> 01:33:52.368
Go!

01:33:52.602 --> 01:33:58.202
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on. Go get him!

01:33:58.308 --> 01:33:59.308
Wow.

01:33:59.409 --> 01:34:00.809
Go, go, go.

01:34:03.013 --> 01:34:04.113
Come on, Zack.

01:34:04.214 --> 01:34:08.414
- Zack!
- You're doing a good job.

01:34:11.821 --> 01:34:14.221
You're getting weak.

01:34:14.624 --> 01:34:15.624
Tampon.

01:34:15.825 --> 01:34:21.125
- All right! Way to go!
- You are fantastic.

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:30.773
Vince, there's one more item.

01:34:30.874 --> 01:34:32.808
- Come on, let's go.
- Zack!

01:34:32.909 --> 01:34:34.310
Watch out below!

01:34:34.411 --> 01:34:37.011
- Jorge!
- What? What?

01:34:43.953 --> 01:34:46.322
- Curveball.
- What to do?

01:34:46.423 --> 01:34:48.090
No price-checking available!

01:34:48.191 --> 01:34:50.351
- Come on, get out of there, dude, go.
- Come on, guys.

01:34:50.375 --> 01:34:52.575
Come on, run, run.

01:34:59.135 --> 01:35:00.135
Zack!

01:35:01.938 --> 01:35:05.407
- Open-ended cart!
- What do you do? What do you do?

01:35:05.508 --> 01:35:06.508
Come on!

01:35:08.578 --> 01:35:10.878
Restock the shelves.

01:35:11.014 --> 01:35:14.114
Be careful with the items.

01:35:22.192 --> 01:35:23.292
Surrender!

01:35:23.593 --> 01:35:25.793
Surrender, box boy.

01:35:28.064 --> 01:35:33.102
- Come on, guys, come on.
- Yeah, yeah. You got it.

01:35:33.203 --> 01:35:34.303
Curveball.

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:41.738
Old woman in need of assistance.
Bunion pads, please.

01:35:51.221 --> 01:35:52.321
Yes! Yes!

01:35:55.358 --> 01:36:00.758
Here we go! Back to the registers!
Let's go.

01:36:15.612 --> 01:36:19.348
And the tiebreaker
goes to Vince Downey!

01:36:19.449 --> 01:36:21.949
Now, that's teamwork.

01:36:29.392 --> 01:36:31.093
Man, you did your best, dude.

01:36:31.194 --> 01:36:33.862
Be proud. You did great.

01:36:33.963 --> 01:36:37.463
It wasn't enough. I blew it.

01:36:54.384 --> 01:36:59.154
- Excuse me, everybody. Excuse me.
- Well,

01:36:59.255 --> 01:37:03.158
never in the history of Super Club
has anyone won employee of the month

01:37:03.259 --> 01:37:04.860
18 times in a row.

01:37:04.961 --> 01:37:07.861
But tonight, someone has.

01:37:08.832 --> 01:37:11.033
The complaint box, please.
Just to make sure.

01:37:11.134 --> 01:37:12.434
Sure. Sure.

01:37:14.604 --> 01:37:17.904
Oh, there is something here.

01:37:19.209 --> 01:37:23.579
- "Super Club blows."
- That was close, huh, Vince?

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:27.916
Our champion and winner of a
brand-newish Chevy Malibu,

01:37:28.017 --> 01:37:32.217
Vince Downey. Downey!
Downey! Downey!

01:37:42.899 --> 01:37:47.102
Thank you. You are
such an inspiration.

01:37:47.203 --> 01:37:50.506
And all of you, the little
people that make Super Club

01:37:50.607 --> 01:37:52.241
- the place it is.
- You're an ass.

01:37:52.342 --> 01:37:55.944
You are the scaffolding on top of
which I stand so high right now.

01:37:56.045 --> 01:37:57.745
And you, Zack,

01:37:58.715 --> 01:38:00.649
you made it a race.

01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:02.785
Thank you. But I won.

01:38:02.886 --> 01:38:05.287
Excuse me, sir. I think there's
something you ought to see.

01:38:05.388 --> 01:38:08.028
Okay, big 'uns, why don't you go
kill a couple of sandwiches there?

01:38:08.091 --> 01:38:10.891
Go ahead, find your way back to the
desert cart and graze a little bit.

01:38:10.992 --> 01:38:13.160
Not right now, Semi. We're
in the middle of something.

01:38:13.261 --> 01:38:15.430
Surveillance footage of
the competition, sir.

01:38:15.531 --> 01:38:18.233
We're in the middle of a celebration.
Okay, all right.

01:38:18.334 --> 01:38:19.768
Well, he is very large.

01:38:19.869 --> 01:38:24.439
This is unconventional. Listen.
But I just want to recap.

01:38:24.540 --> 01:38:26.742
I did some amazing things today.

01:38:26.843 --> 01:38:28.743
Sir, watch this.

01:38:30.146 --> 01:38:33.348
That's the kind of speed that won me
the south-west regional competition.

01:38:33.449 --> 01:38:35.217
I'm embarrassed, actually.

01:38:35.318 --> 01:38:42.318
Sir, I'll rewind it again. But
this time, watch the oats.

01:38:45.695 --> 01:38:46.862
- Well, what? I...
- Hold on.

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:48.003
- Look at this one.
- What?

01:38:48.064 --> 01:38:49.864
Watch the oats.

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:57.172
He tampered with it. I mean
Zack clearly paid the retard.

01:38:57.273 --> 01:38:58.640
It's a forgery.

01:38:58.741 --> 01:39:02.511
- Am I seeing this correctly?
- You see, sir, he didn't rung it up.

01:39:02.612 --> 01:39:04.913
Not only did he cheat
during the competition,

01:39:05.014 --> 01:39:07.950
he's been giving away
free stuff all year long.

01:39:08.051 --> 01:39:09.051
Absurd.

01:39:09.185 --> 01:39:10.879
You see, I got the tapes
to prove it, sir.

01:39:10.903 --> 01:39:12.621
What a ridiculous allegation.

01:39:12.722 --> 01:39:15.390
Sir. He's right, sir. These
are from the registers.

01:39:15.491 --> 01:39:18.493
Same carts, same amount of items.
Different totals.

01:39:18.594 --> 01:39:19.795
Vince Downey.

01:39:19.896 --> 01:39:22.831
You're the fastest, all right.
Fastest criminal in the south-west.

01:39:22.932 --> 01:39:23.932
Hey.

01:39:27.236 --> 01:39:29.571
That's why they call you Semi.

01:39:29.672 --> 01:39:34.176
Vince Downey, you are a disgrace
to me and to the Super Club chain!

01:39:34.277 --> 01:39:37.077
I am not proud of you.

01:39:37.947 --> 01:39:40.716
Get that scum out of here
before I kick his ass myself.

01:39:40.817 --> 01:39:41.817
Yeah!

01:39:52.996 --> 01:39:56.598
Ladies and gentlemen, it looks
like employee of the month

01:39:56.699 --> 01:40:00.269
will go to the
runner-up, Zack Bradley.

01:40:00.370 --> 01:40:03.270
Yes! Yes! Congratulations.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.840
You've won everything.

01:40:13.616 --> 01:40:15.716
That is wonderful.

01:40:17.653 --> 01:40:23.892
- Hold on, he's going in, he's going in.
- He's going.

01:40:23.993 --> 01:40:25.193
Thank you.

01:40:26.963 --> 01:40:29.043
- Listen, I just wanted...
- Listen, I just wanted...

01:40:29.067 --> 01:40:30.599
- You go.
- You go.

01:40:30.700 --> 01:40:31.700
Okay.

01:40:37.840 --> 01:40:40.609
So does this mean that
you only go for the...

01:40:40.710 --> 01:40:46.010
I guess you'll have to
find out next month.

01:40:46.282 --> 01:40:47.762
- Are they kissing?
- They're kissing.

01:40:47.786 --> 01:40:52.886
- They're kissing, yeah.
- They're kissing.

01:41:12.875 --> 01:41:17.375
- I love this song.
- It's the best.

01:41:21.517 --> 01:41:25.387
So, Maxi-Mart really makes you
wear those things, huh, bro?

01:41:25.488 --> 01:41:29.558
Maxi-Mart? No. Jorge,
I am on probation.

01:41:29.659 --> 01:41:30.926
I'm under house arrest.

01:41:31.027 --> 01:41:35.797
I can't go more than a mile
away from my home and/or work.

01:41:35.898 --> 01:41:39.198
It's cool though, I'm out.

01:41:41.037 --> 01:41:45.140
I gotta hand it to you. The car looks
tip-top. It really is immaculate.

01:41:45.241 --> 01:41:46.241
I know.

01:41:46.843 --> 01:41:50.912
- Hey, can I take it for a spin?
- No.

01:41:51.013 --> 01:41:55.751
- Well, can you give me a ride to...
- No.

01:41:55.852 --> 01:41:59.054
How about a ride
to the bus stop?

01:41:59.155 --> 01:42:00.355
Absolutely.

01:42:00.823 --> 01:42:03.325
Jorge, blinks mean it's the border.
No, are you going past...

01:42:03.426 --> 01:42:04.746
All right, you got
to let me out.

01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:11.770
Jorge! Go back! Go back! We're
past the mile. God. Jorge!
