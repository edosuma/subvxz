00:29.118 --> 00:32.056
<i>Earth - our home planet.</i>

00:32.088 --> 00:35.960
<i>Just one of billions
of planets in the universe.</i>

00:35.993 --> 00:39.463
<i>The earth
might seem insignificant,</i>

00:39.496 --> 00:44.035
<i>but for those of us who live
here, she is our home.</i>

00:55.311 --> 00:59.349
- Oh, man! Anne!
- Hmm? Ha!

00:59.383 --> 01:02.386
Our new room is great,
don't you think, petey?

01:02.418 --> 01:05.022
My name is Peter!

01:06.222 --> 01:09.093
Ok, Peter!

01:10.793 --> 01:12.662
Get this straight -
this is your half,

01:12.695 --> 01:15.066
that is my half,
and I don't want to...

01:15.099 --> 01:17.201
My nightfairy kite!

01:17.233 --> 01:19.169
I knew it would be around here!

01:20.737 --> 01:22.606
How about going out
and flying it?

01:22.640 --> 01:24.375
Then I can continue here
undisturbed.

01:24.408 --> 01:27.278
You always have
the best ideas, petey!

01:27.311 --> 01:30.581
Oh, I'm sure you will be
a famous 'astranaut'

01:30.614 --> 01:32.483
just like dad!

01:32.516 --> 01:34.018
That's astro...

01:34.051 --> 01:37.021
Naut.

01:40.424 --> 01:43.527
<i>This is not
standard operating procedure.</i>

01:43.560 --> 01:45.528
<i>This is not something
that has been planned.</i>

01:45.561 --> 01:47.831
<i>Of course, we hope
they were able to survive.</i>

01:47.864 --> 01:50.367
<i>As reported
by the space agency iso,</i>

01:50.400 --> 01:52.769
<i>all astronauts on
the moon mission Pegasus</i>

01:52.802 --> 01:56.706
<i>perished this morning when
the launch vehicle exploded.</i>

02:13.991 --> 02:18.963
<i>Once, this withered
Meadow was our paradise.</i>

02:18.996 --> 02:24.902
<i>Here the story of heroic
June bug zoomzeman begins.</i>

02:24.935 --> 02:28.973
<i>That's me, by the way.</i>

02:29.006 --> 02:30.441
<i>In those days,</i>

02:30.473 --> 02:34.210
<i>we insects lived in
the most splendid birch</i>

02:34.243 --> 02:35.979
<i>the world has ever seen.</i>

02:36.013 --> 02:40.784
<i>It was shelter, food and
was the source of our happiness.</i>

02:42.118 --> 02:43.788
<i>Here is where I married</i>

02:43.820 --> 02:47.091
<i>my beloved
and beautiful mrs zoomzeman!</i>

02:47.925 --> 02:51.662
<i>But suddenly
everything started to change</i>

02:51.694 --> 02:53.631
<i>when the monster appeared.</i>

02:53.663 --> 02:58.468
Ok, guys. This overgrown
toothpick is ours now!

02:58.502 --> 03:00.438
Toothpick.

03:00.471 --> 03:03.106
Toothpick!

03:08.277 --> 03:10.213
Oh!

03:11.481 --> 03:13.651
- Ah!
- Attack!

03:13.683 --> 03:15.652
<i>We brave insects gave it our all</i>

03:15.686 --> 03:17.188
<i>defending our birch tree.</i>

03:17.221 --> 03:18.389
Geronimo!

03:18.421 --> 03:21.725
<i>But our enemy was too strong.</i>

03:21.758 --> 03:24.094
<i>We were wiped away.</i>

03:24.127 --> 03:27.864
<i>But as always, my dear
mrs zoomzeman had a great idea.</i>

03:27.897 --> 03:29.032
<i>She said...</i>

03:29.066 --> 03:31.634
We won't make it on our own.
Go and get the nightfairy.

03:31.668 --> 03:33.604
Oh!

03:33.637 --> 03:37.140
We have to fly to
the moonlight creek. Hurry up!

03:37.174 --> 03:40.545
- Hey, zoomzeman!
- Yes, my sweet...

03:42.612 --> 03:44.914
- Zoomzeman!
- Yes, my dear?

03:44.948 --> 03:47.918
The moonlight creek
is in the other direction!

03:47.950 --> 03:49.721
Of course!

03:50.753 --> 03:53.524
<i>I jumped into
the full moon's reflection,</i>

03:53.556 --> 03:55.191
<i>just as legend has it.</i>

03:55.224 --> 03:57.527
Hmm! Aha!

03:57.561 --> 03:59.796
<i>And then I was shot up
into the sky.</i>

03:59.830 --> 04:00.965
Whoo!

04:00.997 --> 04:03.000
<i>I flew and flew...</i>

04:04.467 --> 04:06.469
<i>And landed in a...</i>

04:06.502 --> 04:08.671
<i>Glass of red wine.</i>

04:08.705 --> 04:09.507
Yuck.

04:09.539 --> 04:12.409
- Ah!
- Eugh.

04:13.176 --> 04:14.912
Oh!

04:14.944 --> 04:16.346
The nightfairy!

04:16.379 --> 04:18.214
Thank my lucky stars!

04:18.247 --> 04:19.283
<i>And I was like...</i>

04:19.315 --> 04:21.017
Dear nightfairy,
you have to help us.

04:21.050 --> 04:22.420
They want to destroy our home!

04:22.452 --> 04:23.720
<i>And then she said...</i>

04:23.754 --> 04:27.158
Leave that to me.
I'll deal with it.

04:27.190 --> 04:29.156
<i>But we were too la-a-a-ate...</i>

04:29.158 --> 04:32.663
Oh!

04:32.696 --> 04:35.066
- Oh!
- The monster!

04:36.365 --> 04:38.568
- Wha...
- Ahhh!

04:38.601 --> 04:41.438
No! I'll catch you!

04:43.173 --> 04:45.543
Mrs zoomzeman!

04:45.576 --> 04:47.111
Oh!

04:47.144 --> 04:50.381
Arggh!

04:51.180 --> 04:52.682
Ooh!

04:52.716 --> 04:55.519
Nightfairy!

04:55.552 --> 04:57.788
You will atone
for this sacrilege!

04:57.821 --> 05:02.193
Henceforth I will banish you...
To the moon!

05:02.225 --> 05:04.728
<i>The nightfairy banished
the boss and his companions</i>

05:04.761 --> 05:08.299
<i>to the moon,
but not just them, also...</i>

05:08.331 --> 05:11.334
<i>Our birch tree as well.</i>

05:12.970 --> 05:14.237
Mission accomplished.

05:14.271 --> 05:17.408
I don't believe it! You've
banished our birch to the moon!

05:17.440 --> 05:18.975
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:19.009 --> 05:21.045
And also my arm. Look!

05:21.077 --> 05:22.378
<i>And she said...</i>

05:22.411 --> 05:25.181
Oh, I'm sorry for that.
These things happen.

05:25.214 --> 05:26.282
<i>And I said...</i>

05:26.315 --> 05:27.550
You have to bring it back.

05:27.584 --> 05:30.754
I'm not to blame.
The bad people are.

05:30.786 --> 05:34.824
To break the spell, you need
brave, animal-loving humans

05:34.858 --> 05:38.127
who travel to the moon
and bring back the birch.

05:38.161 --> 05:42.065
By the way, as for my help,
it was my pleasure.

05:42.098 --> 05:43.334
Bye-bye!

05:43.367 --> 05:45.201
<i>When the nightfairy had left,</i>

05:45.235 --> 05:49.807
<i>I realised that my dear
mrs zoomzeman was gone too.</i>

05:49.839 --> 05:52.976
- <i>I searched for her.</i>
- Mrs zoomzeman!

05:53.009 --> 05:57.413
Where are you? Where are you?

06:01.651 --> 06:06.456
That was the last night
I'd see my mrs zoomzeman.

06:06.490 --> 06:07.992
Oh, that's so sad.

06:08.024 --> 06:11.995
Oh! I searched for her
for an eternity...

06:13.730 --> 06:16.266
But I've never found her again.

06:17.500 --> 06:21.871
But this prophecy
is our last and only chance

06:21.904 --> 06:24.274
to retrieve our birch.

06:24.307 --> 06:25.742
And my arm.

06:25.776 --> 06:27.877
No hard feelings, mr zoomzeman,

06:27.911 --> 06:30.548
but I'd appreciate if you didn't
tell so many fairytales

06:30.581 --> 06:31.581
to the little ones.

06:31.615 --> 06:32.650
Those aren't fairytales!

06:32.682 --> 06:35.485
They... they... they
are our salvation!

06:35.519 --> 06:37.922
Yeah, right, sure they are.

06:37.954 --> 06:39.956
Everybody get in now,
and off we go.

06:39.990 --> 06:41.292
It's not too late!

06:41.324 --> 06:45.762
We just have to find some brave,
kind, animal-loving humans.

06:45.795 --> 06:47.997
Do you think
I just made all this up?

06:48.031 --> 06:52.369
No! Why should a lonely old
beetle make up stories?

06:52.401 --> 06:54.971
To gain attention? No!

06:55.004 --> 06:59.409
- Somewhere out there - ha, ha, ha!
- There are more of us.

06:59.442 --> 07:01.844
And as soon as I get back
the birch and my arm...

07:01.877 --> 07:04.514
Oh, you mean
the one on the moon?

07:04.548 --> 07:06.716
Exactly!

07:06.750 --> 07:08.752
Then everything
will change completely.

07:08.785 --> 07:13.223
Oh, zoomzeman, take a good look
in the mirror.

07:13.255 --> 07:14.324
Be honest with yourself.

07:14.358 --> 07:16.593
You're an old grey bug

07:16.627 --> 07:17.961
fighting a losing battle.

07:17.995 --> 07:19.163
Now, goodbye!

07:19.196 --> 07:20.798
Yee-ha!

07:36.579 --> 07:40.483
Good morning, darling. Did you
sleep well in your new room?

07:40.516 --> 07:43.187
I have a favour
to ask of you, petey.

07:43.220 --> 07:45.889
Stop calling me petey!
My name is Peter!

07:45.922 --> 07:47.725
Fine. Peter.

07:47.757 --> 07:50.526
I know it's not easy, darling.

07:50.560 --> 07:51.728
Moving, the new school...

07:51.762 --> 07:53.663
I wish we didn't have to
move at all!

07:53.697 --> 07:57.401
Oh, sweetheart. You know
we couldn't afford that.

07:57.434 --> 07:59.269
But I need my own room!

07:59.302 --> 08:00.838
I don't want to share one

08:00.870 --> 08:01.938
together with Anne.

08:01.971 --> 08:03.373
Both of you need time

08:03.406 --> 08:04.807
for that, you'll see.

08:04.841 --> 08:07.578
Do me one favour and watch out
for your sister today.

08:07.610 --> 08:10.814
You're the big brother
and the more mature of you two.

08:12.182 --> 08:13.984
Do I have your word, Peter?

08:14.016 --> 08:15.653
But she's cuckoo!

08:15.685 --> 08:19.722
Please, don't say things
like that. Anne is not cuckoo!

08:19.755 --> 08:21.924
Dad would have believed me!

08:21.958 --> 08:23.927
Our new house is the best!

08:23.959 --> 08:26.562
There's a unicorn
living underneath my wallpaper

08:26.596 --> 08:29.667
that can turn itself into
a fire-breathing pigeon!

08:29.699 --> 08:32.903
And if I spit on my feet,
I can suddenly dance!

08:34.171 --> 08:37.074
She just has
a vivid imagination.

08:37.106 --> 08:39.509
Look out for her, please.

08:39.543 --> 08:41.611
- But, mom, I was just, like...
- Come on, petey!

08:41.644 --> 08:44.447
Spit on my feet
and you'll see how I dance!

08:59.129 --> 09:00.163
Oh.

09:00.197 --> 09:02.166
Did you see that?

09:02.198 --> 09:03.332
Ahh.

09:03.365 --> 09:06.370
- Ahh. Hi! Oh!
- Oh!

09:06.403 --> 09:07.870
Oh, no!

09:07.903 --> 09:10.841
So awkward!

09:10.874 --> 09:13.911
What's all that stuff
in your backpack anyway?

09:13.943 --> 09:15.144
Do you really need it all?

09:15.177 --> 09:19.783
This is my fairytale survival
kit. Of course I need it!

09:24.721 --> 09:28.225
Hey, fellas, lookee here!
Are you the new kid?

09:28.258 --> 09:32.229
Um, yes. Hi, I'm Peter. We...

09:32.261 --> 09:34.764
- Oh, hey, Peter.
- Hey. Oh!

09:34.798 --> 09:38.067
Ha! You snooze, you lose,
you loser!

09:38.100 --> 09:40.070
Hey! You take that back!

09:40.102 --> 09:42.105
Petey is definitely cool.

09:42.139 --> 09:43.407
He's really good at math

09:43.440 --> 09:46.043
and he knows everything
about planets and stars.

09:46.076 --> 09:47.444
And he always takes care of me.

09:47.476 --> 09:49.145
That's just, uh...

09:49.178 --> 09:51.414
Hey, well... maybe...

09:51.447 --> 09:54.217
- Don't listen to her.
- Oh, ok, ok, petey.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.952
Hey, I tell you what,

09:55.985 --> 09:58.288
why don't you just show us
what you're made of?

09:58.321 --> 10:00.257
How about a dare?

10:00.289 --> 10:02.692
- Ha! No problem for petey!
- Hm.

10:02.725 --> 10:04.861
Alrighty.

10:05.729 --> 10:08.365
Look at what we have here.

10:08.398 --> 10:10.433
Oh! Hey, what are you doing
with me?

10:10.466 --> 10:12.668
Where am I?

10:12.701 --> 10:16.139
Go ahead! Shoot him down!

10:16.173 --> 10:17.573
- No way!
- Are you nuts?

10:17.606 --> 10:19.543
That's cruelty to animals!

10:19.576 --> 10:22.546
Exactly. Now do it!

10:23.846 --> 10:25.649
Uh, hello?

10:25.682 --> 10:27.283
Then I'll do it myself!

10:27.317 --> 10:30.086
Ok, alright. I'll do it.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.754
Petey! Don't!

10:32.688 --> 10:35.057
Get me outta here! Let me out!

10:35.091 --> 10:37.995
Poor bug!

10:45.836 --> 10:47.870
Ugh!

10:47.903 --> 10:50.173
You're such a wimp!

10:50.206 --> 10:52.509
I'll do it myself!

10:54.144 --> 10:57.313
Hey! Huh? Hey! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:57.346 --> 10:59.917
- You missed him, wow!
- Of course!

10:59.950 --> 11:01.451
I did it on purpose!

11:01.484 --> 11:03.253
Come on, let's get out of here!

11:03.285 --> 11:05.621
Oh! Oh!

11:05.654 --> 11:10.326
I got 'em! I found 'em!
He missed me on purpose!

11:10.360 --> 11:12.229
He's clever and animal-loving.

11:12.261 --> 11:14.030
I've found the right humans!

11:14.063 --> 11:15.998
Oh! I must...

11:16.032 --> 11:18.602
Oh. Oh... oh, no.

11:18.634 --> 11:21.705
Where are you?
I need you! The prophecy!

11:21.738 --> 11:23.006
Oh! Arggh!

11:30.447 --> 11:34.051
That was awesome!
You're a... hero!

11:34.083 --> 11:36.085
No, I'm not! And no, it wasn't!

11:36.119 --> 11:39.590
Your constant blabbering
is gonna be the end of me.

11:39.623 --> 11:41.191
Now we don't just have
zero friends,

11:41.224 --> 11:45.429
but also a bunch of guys
who want to smash my face in.

11:47.797 --> 11:48.966
- Ow!
- Ugh!

11:50.500 --> 11:52.369
By the way, he could talk.

11:52.402 --> 11:55.772
- What? Who?
- The bug! Who else?

11:55.804 --> 11:57.240
- The bug!
- Yeah.

11:57.274 --> 11:58.609
He said he was looking for us.

11:58.642 --> 12:01.378
- Stop it! Bugs don't talk!
- Hm?

12:01.410 --> 12:04.213
And there's no such thing
as witches or fairies

12:04.246 --> 12:06.216
and sorcerers and pink unicorns

12:06.249 --> 12:08.085
that nibble holes in your socks!

12:08.118 --> 12:11.822
You and all your nonsense
cause me nothing but trouble!

12:11.855 --> 12:12.956
But listen...

12:12.990 --> 12:15.225
I don't wanna have anything
to do with you anymore.

12:15.258 --> 12:17.027
Is that clear? Nothing!

12:17.059 --> 12:18.461
How's that supposed to work?

12:18.495 --> 12:19.863
We share a room, you know?

12:19.895 --> 12:21.097
That's bad enough.

12:21.130 --> 12:24.267
Sometimes I wish I could
send you to... to the moon.

12:50.326 --> 12:53.096
Children! Children?

12:55.498 --> 12:57.935
Where are you? Children!

12:57.967 --> 13:01.804
How could I have let them
just vanish just like that? Oh!

13:01.837 --> 13:06.342
My... my poor birch tree!
My... my poor arm!

13:06.375 --> 13:08.678
Lost forever!

13:11.480 --> 13:15.785
I will never find them again
as long as I...

13:15.818 --> 13:19.423
Ugh! Arggh!

13:22.325 --> 13:23.794
Hmm?

13:26.763 --> 13:29.066
Arggh...

13:30.166 --> 13:32.836
Arggh!

13:32.869 --> 13:34.971
Ah-ah-ah-ooh-ah!

13:35.004 --> 13:36.139
Whoa!

13:37.941 --> 13:40.476
Whoa!

13:43.446 --> 13:46.950
Hello, mr bug. Are you ok?

13:46.982 --> 13:50.119
It's you! A miracle!

13:50.153 --> 13:51.221
I've found you!

13:52.822 --> 13:55.591
Where's the other child?

13:55.625 --> 13:57.027
- My brother?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

13:57.059 --> 13:59.962
- He's sleeping.
- You're so slow. Wake him up!

13:59.995 --> 14:02.331
We have to go to the moon!

14:02.365 --> 14:07.236
To the moon? Fantastic! But why?

14:07.269 --> 14:08.538
Oh, uh...

14:09.304 --> 14:11.808
I will tell you.

14:13.909 --> 14:16.346
Petey! Wake up!

14:16.379 --> 14:18.148
What?

14:18.181 --> 14:20.017
Well, we are the chosen children

14:20.049 --> 14:22.918
and have to fly to the moon
with mr zoomzeman!

14:22.951 --> 14:25.389
His little arm
and his birch are there

14:25.422 --> 14:26.956
and the mean tree thieves,

14:26.990 --> 14:30.326
because the nightfairy banished
all of them to the moon.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.764
Oh, no, Anne, stop it!

14:33.797 --> 14:35.632
We need to get to
the moonlight creek

14:35.664 --> 14:37.134
while the moon is still full

14:37.167 --> 14:38.802
and mirrored in the river.

14:38.835 --> 14:41.437
The bug says
the old legends say...

14:41.471 --> 14:42.572
That's enough!

14:42.605 --> 14:45.942
I've already told you,
bugs don't talk!

14:45.975 --> 14:47.277
But this one does!

14:47.309 --> 14:49.345
You're driving me crazy!

14:49.379 --> 14:51.615
- Argh!
- I want to sleep!

14:51.648 --> 14:54.051
- Don't you get it?
- Hmm!

14:54.083 --> 14:56.018
Hmph!

14:58.955 --> 15:00.624
He doesn't want to come.

15:00.657 --> 15:04.227
What? What do you mean,
he doesn't want to come?

15:04.259 --> 15:06.429
We... we need him!

15:06.462 --> 15:10.132
The full moon is disappearing!
We don't have much time!

15:10.166 --> 15:12.636
Maybe one human is enough

15:12.668 --> 15:16.139
if she's brave enough for two!

15:16.172 --> 15:19.643
Hm? Hm!

15:22.144 --> 15:25.716
What now? Ahh!

15:27.049 --> 15:28.885
Anne?

15:30.519 --> 15:32.523
This isn't happening.

15:33.322 --> 15:34.323
What?

15:35.991 --> 15:38.360
Whoa!

15:38.394 --> 15:40.663
Uh! Ouch!

15:52.207 --> 15:53.709
Ah!

15:55.711 --> 15:57.014
Whoa!

15:59.916 --> 16:02.319
Uh-uh-uh!

16:02.351 --> 16:04.153
Wait till I catch you!

16:13.096 --> 16:14.163
Whoa!

16:16.032 --> 16:17.934
Anne, hold on!

16:17.966 --> 16:19.535
Hold on! Anne!

16:20.336 --> 16:21.605
Anne!

16:22.871 --> 16:24.073
No! Don't!

16:28.610 --> 16:29.679
Ohh.

16:31.480 --> 16:33.817
Anne! Help!

16:36.152 --> 16:38.088
Please, someone help!

16:38.120 --> 16:41.891
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

16:44.226 --> 16:46.697
What am I supposed to do now?

16:56.172 --> 16:58.675
Whoa!

17:00.976 --> 17:04.514
Whoa!

17:06.048 --> 17:09.085
Arggh!

17:22.798 --> 17:26.002
Arggh!

17:27.170 --> 17:28.572
Ugh!

17:42.218 --> 17:44.354
Oh! Oh!

17:46.221 --> 17:48.491
Where...

17:51.827 --> 17:53.963
Where am I?

17:53.997 --> 17:55.098
Anne?

17:56.266 --> 17:57.534
Whoa!

18:00.470 --> 18:03.406
I must be dreaming.

18:05.474 --> 18:08.577
Oh.

18:08.611 --> 18:10.514
Anne?

18:13.915 --> 18:16.919
Oh. Oh.

18:20.022 --> 18:21.590
Oh.

18:21.624 --> 18:23.093
Ohh.

18:24.124 --> 18:24.860
Whoa!

18:24.894 --> 18:27.396
Oh!

18:33.201 --> 18:35.404
Oh? Oh.

18:38.106 --> 18:40.543
Where could they be?

18:42.511 --> 18:45.749
How am I supposed to work
under these conditions?

18:45.781 --> 18:48.183
- Excuse me.
- Arggh!

18:48.217 --> 18:49.719
Hmm?

18:49.751 --> 18:51.620
Oh. Ha. Uh...

18:51.653 --> 18:56.792
Is that a reflecting telescope
or a refracting telescope?

18:56.826 --> 18:58.662
Are you crazy?

18:58.694 --> 19:00.562
Watch your step, young man.

19:00.596 --> 19:02.198
Who are you anyway?

19:02.230 --> 19:04.467
I'm Peter, and who are you?

19:04.500 --> 19:09.138
Peter, you say?
Meadow way 23? That Peter?

19:09.172 --> 19:10.774
The one with the sister?

19:10.807 --> 19:13.610
I could have searched
for you all night.

19:13.643 --> 19:15.278
Why aren't you in your bed?

19:15.310 --> 19:16.980
That's a bit complicated.

19:17.012 --> 19:20.250
There was this bug and he took
my sister with him and...

19:20.282 --> 19:22.451
Ah! Sorry, this story's
too long for me.

19:22.484 --> 19:23.986
I'll be late for my class.

19:24.019 --> 19:25.355
What are you doing?

19:25.387 --> 19:27.122
What do you think I'm doing?

19:27.155 --> 19:30.292
Sending naughty children to
slumberland. That's my job.

19:30.326 --> 19:31.528
I'm the sandman.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.864
The sandman?
But you don't exist!

19:34.896 --> 19:37.200
Oh, really? Goodnight!

19:37.232 --> 19:38.768
- No!
- Yes!

19:38.800 --> 19:40.803
Otherwise, I'll never
get through this shift.

19:40.836 --> 19:43.605
- If you really are the sandman - oooh!
-

19:43.638 --> 19:45.841
you are a friend of children,
aren't you?

19:46.642 --> 19:49.712
Oh, you're a wise guy.

19:49.746 --> 19:55.251
Yeah, I like children...
When they're sleeping.

19:55.284 --> 19:56.820
Uh!

19:58.121 --> 19:59.889
Oh, alright.

19:59.922 --> 20:03.727
So, tell me what happened
to this sister of yours.

20:10.700 --> 20:12.302
Huh? Huh?

20:12.335 --> 20:16.873
Mr zoomzeman!
Why are you so big?

20:16.905 --> 20:20.643
Oh, my god!
You're right! Look at me!

20:20.675 --> 20:25.749
Maybe you've grown because
you're not on the earth anymore.

20:25.781 --> 20:28.617
Oh?

20:28.651 --> 20:30.353
Hm!

20:30.385 --> 20:32.588
Are we on the moon now?

20:32.622 --> 20:34.591
Huh?

20:34.624 --> 20:38.761
It doesn't look like it.

20:38.795 --> 20:40.363
Oh!

20:40.395 --> 20:42.965
But where are we, then?

20:46.102 --> 20:51.007
Oh, wow!

20:51.039 --> 20:52.776
Ahh! Oh!

20:52.808 --> 20:56.311
If petey was here,
he'd know for sure.

20:56.345 --> 20:58.213
He's really good
with planets and stuff.

20:58.247 --> 21:00.050
Hm?

21:03.486 --> 21:06.757
Wow!

21:09.525 --> 21:12.262
- Hello! Hi there!
- Oh, no, no, no!

21:12.295 --> 21:14.765
- No!
- Whee!

21:16.231 --> 21:17.433
Hey!

21:17.467 --> 21:20.370
Hey, you, where are we?

21:20.403 --> 21:22.639
On the starry Meadow!

21:22.672 --> 21:25.275
Oh! On the starry Meadow?

21:25.307 --> 21:26.809
And what's that over there?

21:26.843 --> 21:29.579
That's our school,
the shooting star school.

21:29.612 --> 21:30.980
Wow!

21:35.718 --> 21:38.855
Wait a second. And done!

21:38.887 --> 21:39.923
Ta-da!

21:39.955 --> 21:42.057
That really looks good on you.

21:42.090 --> 21:42.891
You think so?

21:42.924 --> 21:44.827
Are you really human?
From earth?

21:44.861 --> 21:47.630
Mmm. And what are you
learning at school?

21:47.663 --> 21:49.531
We learn to sing
and how to twinkle,

21:49.565 --> 21:52.000
and when we grow up
and become real stars,

21:52.034 --> 21:53.736
we get a child assigned to us

21:53.769 --> 21:55.939
that we then look after
for a whole lifetime.

21:55.971 --> 21:59.475
Which one of you
is going to look after me, then?

21:59.509 --> 22:01.310
We're not allowed to tell you.

22:01.344 --> 22:03.913
Huh? Can you also
speak one at a time?

22:03.945 --> 22:05.682
Of course. No problem.

22:05.714 --> 22:07.951
Can you

22:07.983 --> 22:11.420
maybe tell us how to get

22:11.453 --> 22:13.155
to the moon?

22:14.390 --> 22:16.759
Oh?

22:16.791 --> 22:18.461
Oh.

22:18.493 --> 22:19.561
What was that?

22:19.595 --> 22:22.999
Uh-oh. That doesn't sound good
at all.

22:25.934 --> 22:29.371
For the last 300 years,
I've never been late.

22:29.404 --> 22:31.039
And now this,

22:31.073 --> 22:32.542
which is entirely your fault.

22:32.575 --> 22:36.513
Hmm. Does it have an achromatic
lens or folded refractors?

22:36.546 --> 22:39.949
Uh, what? The achro, um...

22:39.981 --> 22:42.218
Whatchamacallit, I think.

22:42.250 --> 22:43.353
Whatchamacallit?

22:43.385 --> 22:45.387
And what's the refraction index?

22:45.421 --> 22:48.758
Ohhh! Of course I know it,
but...

22:48.790 --> 22:52.060
Oh! Enough already!
Annoying smarty-pants.

22:52.094 --> 22:54.096
What's that smoke over there?

22:55.498 --> 22:58.701
Oh, my gosh!

22:58.733 --> 23:00.836
Come, hurry!

23:06.576 --> 23:08.778
What happened?

23:10.645 --> 23:13.482
Where are my shooting stars?

23:15.151 --> 23:17.787
What happened here? Oh!

23:18.587 --> 23:20.490
Where are my little ones?

23:24.660 --> 23:27.663
Oh! Oh. It came from over there!

23:28.730 --> 23:30.834
Be careful, it may be dangerous.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.802
Oh. Ooh, what...

23:34.869 --> 23:36.705
Eugh, a bug.

23:36.739 --> 23:40.742
A bug, a bug? I am not a bug!
I'm zoomzeman.

23:40.776 --> 23:42.620
Zoomzeman's the name.
From the house of zoomzeman.

23:42.644 --> 23:44.413
Where's my sister, huh?

23:44.446 --> 23:45.647
And my shooting stars?

23:45.681 --> 23:46.682
Uh...

23:46.715 --> 23:47.716
Speak!

23:47.750 --> 23:50.920
I'm afraid...

23:50.952 --> 23:53.455
- They've been kidnapped.
- Kidnapped?

23:53.489 --> 23:56.559
Who would do
something like that?

24:10.740 --> 24:13.742
I have such a headache!

24:14.542 --> 24:16.445
Where are we now?

24:16.479 --> 24:19.783
Hang on.
We'll light things up a bit.

24:20.583 --> 24:24.521
Up there, is that the earth?

24:37.633 --> 24:39.669
Get with it, you lazybones!

24:39.701 --> 24:43.038
Stand up and form two lines!

24:43.071 --> 24:44.506
Hm! And if we don't want to?

24:44.539 --> 24:47.876
Then you'll make the
acquaintance of my moon poodles.

24:47.910 --> 24:50.113
Oh! I like poodles!

24:50.145 --> 24:54.282
They're cute and sweet,
and their fur is so soft.

24:54.316 --> 24:57.386
Is that so?

25:03.792 --> 25:05.661
Ahhh.

25:05.694 --> 25:08.630
Get 'em out, you knuckleheads!

25:08.663 --> 25:11.299
Ok, move!

25:11.333 --> 25:13.769
What do you mean, kidnapped?
By whom?

25:13.803 --> 25:16.406
Well, I... I didn't really
get much of a look at 'em,

25:16.439 --> 25:17.440
to be honest.

25:17.472 --> 25:19.608
I... I played dead.

25:19.642 --> 25:21.344
You pretended you were dead?

25:21.376 --> 25:23.645
I thought you were such a hero!

25:23.679 --> 25:27.250
Yeah, but I'm also a beetle.
We play dead. It's what we do.

25:27.282 --> 25:29.418
What kind of an excuse is that?

25:29.451 --> 25:30.886
I want my little sister back!

25:30.920 --> 25:33.489
Yeah, yeah, of course.
I mean, we still have time.

25:33.521 --> 25:35.390
What are you talking about?

25:35.423 --> 25:37.492
What? Oh, yeah,
I mean, uh, yeah, well...

25:37.526 --> 25:40.730
What I mean is that
we have time to find her

25:40.762 --> 25:42.264
until sunrise.

25:42.298 --> 25:43.332
What?

25:43.365 --> 25:45.902
Why? What happens at sunrise?

25:45.934 --> 25:51.073
Well... she will have to
stay here forever.

25:51.106 --> 25:54.443
When the sun comes up on earth,
nobody will be able to return.

25:54.477 --> 25:57.980
What? How could you put Anne
in danger like that?

25:58.012 --> 26:00.582
I want her back right now!

26:00.615 --> 26:03.118
All of a sudden you're
the caring brother, are you?

26:03.152 --> 26:05.922
Well, that's not
my first impression.

26:07.021 --> 26:09.558
That... that's not fair.

26:09.592 --> 26:12.361
I just didn't believe
in her stories,

26:12.394 --> 26:15.664
like talking bugs,
mr sandman and all that.

26:15.698 --> 26:19.035
I'd promised to look after her,
and now...

26:19.067 --> 26:21.203
Here, this'll help.

26:21.237 --> 26:23.406
I drink it
whenever I have to think about

26:23.439 --> 26:25.675
my poor mrs zoomzeman.

26:25.708 --> 26:29.345
This is certainly not the time
for forget-me-not juice.

26:29.377 --> 26:32.414
Are you out of your mind?
Give that back to me!

26:34.083 --> 26:36.384
This is my bottle!

26:36.417 --> 26:38.320
Guys!

26:38.354 --> 26:40.590
Please! Stop!

26:40.623 --> 26:44.192
Stop it right now!
We have no time for this!

26:44.226 --> 26:50.099
Oh! Look what you've gone
and done!

26:50.132 --> 26:53.302
It's as good as empty!

26:53.335 --> 26:54.903
Oh, that's...

26:55.703 --> 26:58.508
- That's a moonstone!
- Oh?

26:58.540 --> 27:01.043
And what does that mean?

27:02.510 --> 27:05.048
It means
we've got a race to win.

27:06.582 --> 27:08.584
What sort of race
are we talking about?

27:08.616 --> 27:10.752
- And what's all this stuff for?
- Catch!

27:10.786 --> 27:13.322
- For the trip.
- To the moon?

27:13.355 --> 27:16.192
No, to the Caribbean.

27:16.224 --> 27:18.660
Well, of course
it's to the moon!

27:18.693 --> 27:22.397
The kidnapper
must have lost this moonstone.

27:22.431 --> 27:25.535
Hence he must have
been on the moon.

27:25.567 --> 27:28.471
Now, put these on.
It'll be cold on the sleigh.

27:28.503 --> 27:31.072
We're going by sleigh?

27:31.105 --> 27:33.576
Not with just any old sleigh.

27:33.608 --> 27:36.145
With the best sleigh
in the galaxy!

27:40.548 --> 27:43.086
Here you go. Look.

27:45.421 --> 27:46.989
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

27:47.021 --> 27:50.259
Uh... please tell me
that's not our ride.

27:52.094 --> 27:54.130
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm-hm.

27:54.163 --> 27:55.230
I think he's nuts.

27:55.263 --> 27:57.365
And how's that?

27:57.398 --> 27:59.367
- Oh, whoa!
- Whoa!

27:59.401 --> 28:01.904
Is this perhaps
more to your liking?

28:10.546 --> 28:12.715
Maybe he isn't that nuts.

28:12.748 --> 28:13.548
Wow!

28:13.582 --> 28:15.918
Did you want to say something?

28:15.951 --> 28:18.721
Off we go, my little ones!

28:25.126 --> 28:26.995
The only way onto the moon

28:27.028 --> 28:29.164
is with the permission
of the nightfairy.

28:29.198 --> 28:31.901
- I know her!
- Oh, good for you!

28:31.933 --> 28:33.068
Problem is,

28:33.102 --> 28:35.671
today she's hosting a banquet
for the nature spirits.

28:35.703 --> 28:38.807
Disturbing her is completely
out of the question.

28:40.576 --> 28:45.014
Ahh! Oh, wow! Amazing!

28:45.047 --> 28:49.585
Uh... but aren't you kind of
a nature spirit yourself?

28:49.617 --> 28:51.253
What do you mean, "kind of"?

28:51.287 --> 28:53.154
Of course I am a nature spirit!

28:53.188 --> 28:54.590
So, where's the problem?

28:54.623 --> 28:58.126
Look, there are five seats
at the nightfairy's table,

28:58.160 --> 29:00.129
but there are
six nature spirits,

29:00.162 --> 29:01.963
hence the milky way race.

29:01.997 --> 29:04.700
Places one to five
get a seat at her table,

29:04.732 --> 29:07.369
and the last one
goes home empty-handed.

29:07.403 --> 29:09.538
- A race along the milky way?
- Yeah.

29:09.570 --> 29:12.240
Wow! We're a shoo-in
for first place, right?

29:12.273 --> 29:14.843
Oh, let's put it this way -

29:14.876 --> 29:16.678
I've never seen
her palace before,

29:16.711 --> 29:18.847
at least not from the inside.

29:18.881 --> 29:21.784
Come on, my little beauties,
hurry up, hurry up!

29:35.763 --> 29:37.799
Keep working, you lazy twerps!

29:37.833 --> 29:40.169
Yeah, work.
Move your grubby little fingers!

29:40.201 --> 29:42.038
Come on, you gotta hurry!

29:42.070 --> 29:44.406
Yeah, hurry up.

29:45.540 --> 29:46.841
Speed it up.

29:46.875 --> 29:49.278
Our new moon Cannon
isn't gonna build itself.

29:49.310 --> 29:51.346
We still need parts. Go!

29:51.380 --> 29:53.282
Come on, get the lead out,
slugs!

29:53.315 --> 29:54.482
Hmm.

29:54.516 --> 29:56.552
Moonman wants
everything sorted by sunrise!

29:56.585 --> 30:00.756
Come on, stop acting
like the big enchilada.

30:00.788 --> 30:03.358
My big brother will be here
to free me soon anyway.

30:03.392 --> 30:06.562
What's a big brother?

30:06.595 --> 30:08.364
How should I describe it?

30:08.396 --> 30:11.166
Someone who never, ever
takes you seriously,

30:11.200 --> 30:14.202
never, ever wants to have the
slightest thing to do with you

30:14.236 --> 30:17.473
and always, always
knows better than you.

30:17.506 --> 30:19.709
And he's really gonna
come and get you?

30:19.741 --> 30:22.711
Of course. He's my brother.

30:22.744 --> 30:26.414
Silence! The moonman
doesn't want you to talk.

30:26.448 --> 30:29.652
"The moonman wants this,
the moonman wants that..."

30:31.185 --> 30:33.422
You are men too, aren't you?

30:33.454 --> 30:34.889
Well, of course we are.

30:34.923 --> 30:37.259
And you're on the moon too,
right?

30:37.291 --> 30:38.827
- Um...
- Oh...

30:38.861 --> 30:41.931
So how come you guys
aren't the moonman?

30:41.963 --> 30:45.267
Is there some rule that
there can only be one moonman?

30:45.299 --> 30:46.836
- Oh.
- Um...

30:46.868 --> 30:50.438
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't put up with that.

30:50.471 --> 30:52.407
I'd be happy to ask him for you

30:52.441 --> 30:53.776
if you guys are too chicken.

30:53.808 --> 30:56.846
This is none of your business.
Get back to work!

30:56.878 --> 30:58.046
Hm?

30:58.079 --> 30:59.181
Please!

30:59.213 --> 31:02.018
Hm. Ok.

31:06.055 --> 31:08.691
You're about to see
how fantastic the milky way is.

31:08.723 --> 31:09.692
Oh, yeah!

31:09.724 --> 31:11.693
The milky way
is one of the most beautiful

31:11.727 --> 31:14.196
two-arm barred
spiral galaxies around!

31:14.229 --> 31:16.399
What was that?

31:16.432 --> 31:18.366
Ah, we have to hurry!

31:18.400 --> 31:20.503
Yeah, but a little bit slower!

31:20.536 --> 31:21.637
Ladies and gentlemen,

31:21.670 --> 31:24.440
welcome to the annual
nature spirit race

31:24.472 --> 31:25.673
here in the milky way arena.

31:25.707 --> 31:27.043
Ooh!

31:27.076 --> 31:30.779
I'm your host,
the one and only milkyway man!

31:30.813 --> 31:33.282
In pole position,
last year's winner,

31:33.315 --> 31:37.053
storm giant and his thunderbolt.

31:37.086 --> 31:38.621
Olé! Olé!

31:38.653 --> 31:41.824
The next competitor, the man
who invented bad weather,

31:41.856 --> 31:43.224
rainy Robin!

31:43.258 --> 31:46.694
- Namaste, everybody.
- Ha-ha! Here I am!

31:46.728 --> 31:48.297
The lightning witch,

31:48.329 --> 31:50.007
always looking for trouble
and on the attack.

31:50.031 --> 31:54.936
The ruler of sleet
and freezing rain, Henry hail!

31:54.970 --> 31:56.905
Vanilla flavour for you!

31:56.939 --> 32:00.042
On her fluffy cloud goose,
mother frost!

32:00.075 --> 32:03.078
- Yeah!
- Hello, my darlings!

32:03.112 --> 32:04.947
And finally, the little sandman.

32:04.980 --> 32:08.750
Oh, he's not here yet?
Never mind, he'll lose anyway.

32:08.784 --> 32:11.653
Ladies and gentlemen,
pull up your socks,

32:11.686 --> 32:14.022
fasten your seatbelts
and take a deep breath.

32:14.056 --> 32:17.157
Let the race begin!

32:24.298 --> 32:26.969
- Ohhh!
- Here we go!

32:27.001 --> 32:30.306
We need to be real
fast, my little ones. Real fast!

32:30.338 --> 32:32.808
- I wanna get out!
- Oh!

32:38.747 --> 32:42.718
Faster, my little ones!
And you, hang on to something!

32:48.323 --> 32:50.793
Where are we?

32:54.529 --> 32:55.998
Say 'cheese',
ladies and gentlemen.

32:56.030 --> 32:59.268
As always, our race starts here
in parmesan desert

32:59.300 --> 33:01.971
and stretches through
good old gouda canyon.

33:03.971 --> 33:05.007
In the lead, as expected,

33:05.039 --> 33:08.409
ruler over the hurricane,
master of the tornado,

33:08.442 --> 33:12.647
mighty king of the typhoon,
the storm giant!

33:12.681 --> 33:16.418
Storm giant for the win!

33:16.451 --> 33:18.120
Jumpin' Jupiter's jockey shorts,

33:18.153 --> 33:21.423
ladies and gentlemen, even the
moon cows are watching the race.

33:21.455 --> 33:23.725
I am the lord of the winds!

33:23.759 --> 33:27.195
Here's my tornado!

33:32.867 --> 33:34.602
Arggh!

33:34.635 --> 33:36.337
Whoa, look out below!

33:36.371 --> 33:37.873
He's gonna feel that one
tomorrow.

33:37.905 --> 33:41.676
Oh, look! Rainy Robin's
giving it a shot!

33:41.710 --> 33:45.413
How long will his lead last?

33:45.446 --> 33:49.617
I am coming!
I am winning! Whoo-hoo!

33:49.651 --> 33:51.721
Get out of the way!

33:55.223 --> 33:58.059
- Gotcha!
- What are you doing?

34:00.194 --> 34:01.563
Right in front of us

34:01.596 --> 34:03.331
you can see
the skimmed milk channel.

34:03.365 --> 34:06.701
Ha-ha! I'll give you hell!

34:10.137 --> 34:12.440
My little mango lassi.

34:14.443 --> 34:16.211
- Bye-bye!
- Ohh!

34:17.545 --> 34:19.480
Things are heating up

34:19.514 --> 34:21.717
on the cheese fondue trail.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.018
One wrong move
and your chances of winning

34:24.052 --> 34:25.621
will simply melt away!

34:29.324 --> 34:31.860
- See you on Christmas, goose!
- But what's this?

34:31.893 --> 34:34.797
Our snoring underdog
is slowly struggling forward.

34:34.829 --> 34:37.766
The sower of sleep,
companion of the kids,

34:37.798 --> 34:40.402
schoolmaster
to the shooting stars,

34:40.434 --> 34:41.971
little sandman!

34:42.003 --> 34:43.438
The sandman!

34:43.472 --> 34:45.074
It's still the sandman.

34:45.106 --> 34:48.376
Not little sandman!

34:48.409 --> 34:51.045
Oh, don't make me laugh!

34:51.079 --> 34:52.181
Ugh!

34:52.213 --> 34:53.849
Arggh!

34:55.150 --> 34:57.019
Oh! Eugh!

34:59.621 --> 35:00.889
Whoo!

35:00.922 --> 35:03.791
Let's see who masters
the frozen yoghurt volcano.

35:07.628 --> 35:11.099
Hey! Hey! What's with you
all of a sudden?

35:11.132 --> 35:13.534
Sorry about that.

35:13.568 --> 35:16.939
Narcolepsy.
It's an occupational hazard.

35:16.972 --> 35:20.109
Narcolepsy? Are you kidding me?
Wake up!

35:21.543 --> 35:24.213
Zoomzeman!
What are we supposed to do?

35:24.246 --> 35:27.148
I am outta here! Oh! Ugh!

35:27.181 --> 35:28.549
Oh! You gotta...

35:28.583 --> 35:30.918
Little sandman
falls behind again.

35:30.952 --> 35:33.956
You snooze, you lose, pal!

35:33.989 --> 35:36.125
Oh! Uh!

35:39.161 --> 35:41.998
Ahhh! Arggh!

35:45.099 --> 35:49.105
Pandemonium! Little sandman
has taken the lead again!

35:52.474 --> 35:54.876
We are in the
home stretch of our race,

35:54.909 --> 35:57.445
the lactose-free river followed
by the baked cheese forest.

35:57.478 --> 35:59.147
Whoa!

35:59.181 --> 36:01.684
As we come to the end
at the nightfairy waterfalls,

36:01.717 --> 36:04.452
I can tell you, only the cream
of the crop will survive!

36:04.485 --> 36:08.022
- Watch out, petey!
- My name is Peter! Whoa!

36:08.056 --> 36:10.425
Arggh!

36:21.235 --> 36:22.237
Oh!

36:26.641 --> 36:27.643
Oh!

36:29.978 --> 36:31.880
Ah! Ah! Arggh!

36:31.913 --> 36:34.717
- Whoa!
- Argh!

36:39.253 --> 36:42.090
Arggh!

36:42.123 --> 36:45.960
Yuck! Milk! Disgusting!

36:45.994 --> 36:47.829
Oh. Mm.

36:50.065 --> 36:51.800
Ah. Oh.

36:51.833 --> 36:52.835
Ah, oh.

36:57.438 --> 36:59.707
Focus, everyone, fo... focus.

36:59.740 --> 37:01.443
Wait a minute. What happened?

37:01.476 --> 37:03.045
What happened?!

37:03.077 --> 37:04.480
You fell asleep at the wheel,

37:04.512 --> 37:06.248
he played dead in the back seat

37:06.280 --> 37:09.050
and we lost the race.

37:10.786 --> 37:15.224
But... wait! Peter, wait!
Where... where are you going?

37:15.257 --> 37:16.425
To the nightfairy!

37:16.458 --> 37:18.494
She has to listen to us,

37:18.527 --> 37:21.096
whether we lost the competition
or not!

37:21.128 --> 37:24.165
Oh, gee. Alright.

37:33.942 --> 37:37.278
Our light is
fading and will soon be out.

37:37.311 --> 37:39.213
What's keeping your big brother?

37:39.246 --> 37:43.985
You know what? We can deal with
those two idiots on our own!

37:44.018 --> 37:46.621
Oh! Oh!

37:46.655 --> 37:48.524
But how?

37:48.556 --> 37:51.626
- Blow a horn at sensitive me!
- Pack some of these!

37:52.626 --> 37:54.061
Hm?

37:58.233 --> 37:59.768
- Oh!
- Oh!

37:59.800 --> 38:01.936
Stay calm. I'll do the talking.

38:01.969 --> 38:04.939
- Hello, we...
- Are you on the guest list?

38:04.972 --> 38:07.509
Ohh. I am the sandman. Hmm.

38:07.541 --> 38:09.377
You're not getting in.

38:09.411 --> 38:11.179
You are too old, you, too young,

38:11.213 --> 38:13.215
and you,
you need four arms to get in.

38:13.248 --> 38:16.018
- Listen...
- Sorry. No guest list, no entry.

38:16.050 --> 38:18.253
But we have urgent business
with the nightfairy.

38:18.286 --> 38:20.755
Hey, no guest list, no entry.

38:20.789 --> 38:24.126
We're not interested
in your stupid party!

38:24.159 --> 38:26.595
- We just want a quick word...
- Just doing my job.

38:26.628 --> 38:28.363
- And you're not on my...
- Hey!

38:28.396 --> 38:30.865
If you say "guest list"
one more time...

38:30.898 --> 38:33.234
Then what?

38:33.268 --> 38:34.970
Oh. Oh.

38:35.003 --> 38:36.838
- Ahh!
- Yeah.

38:37.905 --> 38:39.407
Oi-oi-oi-oi-oi-oi!

38:39.440 --> 38:43.311
Are you crazy? I could
lose my licence for this!

38:43.344 --> 38:45.112
Oh! Ohhh!

38:45.146 --> 38:47.249
Hey! Wait for me!

38:50.251 --> 38:52.954
Huh. You're gonna
be sorry for that!

38:54.322 --> 38:55.757
He doesn't like it!

38:55.789 --> 38:57.960
- Help!
- Ow, my knees!

38:57.992 --> 38:59.126
You know, Peter,

38:59.159 --> 39:00.761
I like your sister
better than you!

39:00.795 --> 39:02.264
- Oh!
- Oh! Ahh!

39:03.731 --> 39:05.300
I don't like heights!

39:05.333 --> 39:07.869
- Come on, I throw you.
- Don't even think...

39:07.902 --> 39:09.904
- Arggh!
- Whoa!

39:09.938 --> 39:11.907
- Hello.
- Save it!

39:15.610 --> 39:17.713
Wait for me!

39:19.581 --> 39:22.918
I'm coming to get you!

39:29.023 --> 39:31.192
Peter, come here!

39:31.226 --> 39:32.661
Up here!

39:32.693 --> 39:36.465
Couldn't we just
ring the doorbell?

39:36.498 --> 39:38.200
- Whoa!
- Oh!

39:38.233 --> 39:40.169
Gotcha, slowpoke!

39:42.269 --> 39:45.072
Get off me,
you ugly stone-faced...

39:45.106 --> 39:46.475
Argh!

39:51.947 --> 39:55.217
Keep climbing!
There's a window up there!

39:55.250 --> 39:57.818
- Huh?
- Hurry, follow me!

39:57.851 --> 40:00.922
All the way up there?
But I'm scared of heights!

40:00.956 --> 40:04.626
Did I really claim
that I like children?

40:08.563 --> 40:11.567
Don't look down!
Don't... look... down!

40:11.599 --> 40:15.069
Oh, I-I just looked down! Ooh!

40:15.869 --> 40:19.607
Hey, zoomzeman.
You can fly, can't you?

40:20.842 --> 40:25.581
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I can! I can fly!

40:27.514 --> 40:29.617
Ha-ha! And another branch.

40:29.650 --> 40:34.188
And another one. Don't fade on
me, guys, you're almost there.

40:42.297 --> 40:44.599
- Ooh! Hey!
- Oh! Thank you there.

40:44.632 --> 40:47.935
The race was so exciting.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.942
Oh, my friends!

40:54.141 --> 40:56.477
My brave, wonderful friends.

40:56.510 --> 40:58.413
Thank you for coming.

40:58.445 --> 41:00.615
I wanted to tell you...

41:02.416 --> 41:05.054
I wanted to tell you...

41:06.420 --> 41:07.888
- I mean...
- Yes?

41:07.922 --> 41:09.791
Yes?

41:09.824 --> 41:11.259
Uh, no, I mean...

41:11.291 --> 41:12.793
What do you mean?

41:12.827 --> 41:14.630
Well...

41:14.663 --> 41:19.735
You are sometimes so
confused, my dear rainy Robin.

41:19.768 --> 41:21.336
Hm? Uh...

41:21.369 --> 41:23.505
Are you all ready for dinner?

41:24.905 --> 41:27.775
Muchacho, tomato, potato,
soupa-soupa-soupa-soupa.

41:27.809 --> 41:29.311
Oh, wonderful!

41:30.878 --> 41:34.482
There's soup
and salad and lots of fruit.

41:34.516 --> 41:37.385
- Oh!
- Whoo!

41:40.855 --> 41:42.791
Yum, yum!

41:42.824 --> 41:45.427
Whoa!

41:47.195 --> 41:49.164
What, no meat?

41:49.197 --> 41:50.899
Oh, my dear storm giant,

41:50.931 --> 41:54.568
here in my palace, we keep
to a strict vegan diet.

41:54.601 --> 41:55.569
Oh!

41:55.603 --> 41:57.739
Another splash, my dear?

41:57.771 --> 42:00.608
Eugh! Keep your soggy mitts
off my cup, please.

42:00.641 --> 42:02.877
You're diluting my moon wine.

42:05.045 --> 42:07.114
A tad overcharged, are we?

42:07.148 --> 42:09.885
Put a lid on it,
you dripping dork!

42:12.052 --> 42:13.387
Whoa!

42:13.420 --> 42:16.390
Wha-what?-ooh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah!

42:16.423 --> 42:19.193
- Shh!
- Hey, hey, let me...

42:19.226 --> 42:20.327
Whaaa...

42:25.333 --> 42:26.635
Eugh!

42:26.668 --> 42:29.438
Yuck, soup! Disgusting!

42:29.471 --> 42:31.505
- June bug soup!
- Yum, yum!

42:31.539 --> 42:33.508
There we go, some meat at last!

42:33.541 --> 42:37.112
Come to your daddy,
my little meatball.

42:38.880 --> 42:43.552
Intruders! I'll see to them!

42:43.585 --> 42:48.090
Why are we so combative,
my dear lightning witch?

42:48.123 --> 42:49.590
Hm!

42:49.623 --> 42:52.293
Oh, what are you doing
in my soup?

42:52.327 --> 42:54.262
I will take care of him.

42:54.295 --> 42:56.465
Oh, please, don't!

42:56.498 --> 42:57.599
Leave me alone!

42:57.632 --> 43:01.235
Oh. Isn't that little sandman?

43:01.268 --> 43:03.304
Uh! Oh!

43:03.338 --> 43:07.542
That would be the sandman,
if you please.

43:07.574 --> 43:09.610
Your majesty,
I need to get to the moon.

43:09.643 --> 43:12.246
I need to save my sister Anne
before the night is over.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.349
Be still, human child.

43:14.382 --> 43:17.052
No-one has given you
permission to talk.

43:17.085 --> 43:18.853
I beg of you, lightning witch,

43:18.887 --> 43:22.257
you are still my guest and it is
I who decides who may speak.

43:22.289 --> 43:26.695
Well, then, do as you please.
I'm out.

43:29.063 --> 43:30.833
- Oh!
- Now, go ahead!

43:32.534 --> 43:35.369
It all began when this bug
came into our room.

43:41.141 --> 43:43.144
Uh, I need to be excused.

43:43.177 --> 43:44.813
You need to what?

43:44.846 --> 43:47.916
- Well, what do you think?
- What?

43:47.949 --> 43:49.818
To wee-wee! What else?

43:49.851 --> 43:53.121
Uh, do shooting stars
need to wee-wee?

43:53.153 --> 43:56.224
Hey, watch out there!

44:00.027 --> 44:01.262
Oh!

44:01.295 --> 44:05.232
- I need to wee-wee too.
- Oh, no! What?

44:05.266 --> 44:08.103
- Me too.
- But... but... but...

44:08.135 --> 44:10.005
But no, you can't!

44:11.239 --> 44:14.309
- Oh, my god!
- You're useless!

44:14.342 --> 44:16.912
Go get 'em!

44:24.686 --> 44:26.254
Now!

44:27.722 --> 44:30.292
Go fetch!

44:33.161 --> 44:35.429
- Let's get out of here!
- Oh, yeah!

44:36.231 --> 44:42.003
- No! Come back! Stay here!
- Yeah, stay here!

44:42.036 --> 44:44.172
Where to now?

44:44.204 --> 44:46.208
Haven't thought about that yet.

44:46.240 --> 44:49.945
The main thing is...
Away from here!

44:49.978 --> 44:52.280
Uh! Arggh!

44:52.313 --> 44:55.584
- Anne!
- Arggh!

45:01.289 --> 45:03.425
We are sure of it,
your highness.

45:03.458 --> 45:06.760
Not only is mr zoomzeman's
arm up there,

45:06.793 --> 45:09.730
but the shooting stars
and my sister as well.

45:09.764 --> 45:12.000
That's why we need
to get to the moon!

45:13.134 --> 45:16.438
- Uh, hello? Hello?
- Hmm?

45:16.471 --> 45:17.838
- Ms nightfairy?
- Hmm? Oh!

45:17.871 --> 45:21.576
Oh, um, sorry.
What was that again, my boy?

45:21.608 --> 45:24.945
I didn't quite get
the bit in the middle.

45:24.978 --> 45:27.514
This little man claims
to have lost his arm,

45:27.547 --> 45:30.584
because some chosen shooting
star took it to the moon.

45:30.617 --> 45:31.452
No!

45:31.485 --> 45:33.320
Weren't you listening?

45:33.353 --> 45:37.024
It's not his arm,
it's his sister's arm.

45:37.057 --> 45:39.193
I thought it was the bug's arm.

45:39.226 --> 45:42.163
- Huh?
- His sister is a bug?

45:42.195 --> 45:44.231
Calm down, everyone.

45:44.264 --> 45:45.733
The reason the arm is gone

45:45.766 --> 45:47.368
is that the chosen
beetle's sister

45:47.402 --> 45:50.438
has a shooting star on the moon.

45:50.471 --> 45:52.440
No. No, no, no, no.

45:52.472 --> 45:57.746
It's my sister and his
shooting stars and his arm!

45:57.778 --> 46:01.315
I don't know. Little sandman?

46:01.349 --> 46:03.051
The boy is right.

46:03.083 --> 46:08.789
And I think that he
is the one behind all of this.

46:08.822 --> 46:10.224
- Him?
- He.

46:10.257 --> 46:11.625
- Huh?
- Him!

46:11.659 --> 46:13.862
- Who?
- The moonman!

46:13.894 --> 46:15.896
Oh, thunder god!

46:15.929 --> 46:17.798
Arggh!

46:18.833 --> 46:21.036
Ow! Huh? Ahh.

46:22.135 --> 46:23.538
Huh?

46:27.708 --> 46:30.811
Wha... wow!

46:30.844 --> 46:31.879
Huh!

46:41.922 --> 46:43.123
Huh?

46:43.157 --> 46:44.425
Hmm!

46:50.164 --> 46:51.466
Oh!

46:53.735 --> 46:55.804
Your highness,
let me explain again.

46:55.836 --> 46:58.373
Anne is there and we have to
be back by sunrise.

46:58.405 --> 47:02.876
Oh, wait a moment. And where
do you want to go now?

47:02.909 --> 47:04.945
To... the... moon!

47:04.978 --> 47:06.614
My sister is there.

47:06.646 --> 47:09.116
No way! I just can't allow that.

47:09.150 --> 47:10.418
Why not?

47:10.451 --> 47:13.221
Just look at you. You're so...

47:13.253 --> 47:14.855
- Um, so...
- Huh?

47:14.889 --> 47:17.659
A journey like this
just isn't for you.

47:17.692 --> 47:21.329
It's for real heroes,
big, brave and strong,

47:21.362 --> 47:23.798
who can confront
all the dangers to come.

47:23.831 --> 47:25.133
Mm-hm.

47:25.166 --> 47:27.302
But bravery and strength

47:27.335 --> 47:30.070
aren't always
a question of size.

47:30.103 --> 47:31.872
You yourself told zoomzeman

47:31.905 --> 47:33.842
to find two brave children
to help him.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.376
Uh, zoomzeman?

47:35.409 --> 47:36.777
Zoomzeman!

47:36.811 --> 47:38.113
Mm-mm-mm-mm!

47:42.050 --> 47:44.552
Eugh, saliva! Disgusting!

47:44.585 --> 47:46.121
Hm.

47:46.153 --> 47:50.692
My father has always dreamed
of flying to the moon,

47:50.724 --> 47:54.028
but he died before his dream
could come true.

47:54.061 --> 47:58.032
Now I have the chance
to follow in his footsteps

47:58.065 --> 47:59.900
and save my sister.

47:59.934 --> 48:02.170
That's why I need to go
to the moon,

48:02.202 --> 48:04.739
whether you approve it or not.

48:04.771 --> 48:06.306
Oh.

48:06.340 --> 48:10.345
Oh! Are you crying?

48:10.378 --> 48:13.948
What? Me? No, just the rain.

48:13.981 --> 48:18.553
Well, I am crying, and i'm
not ashamed to admit it.

48:20.922 --> 48:23.891
Very well, then.

48:23.925 --> 48:26.760
You may fly to the moon.

48:27.929 --> 48:31.066
And I will send along with you
my swiftest companion.

48:31.099 --> 48:33.867
Do you know the great bear?

48:33.900 --> 48:34.768
Ursa major?

48:34.802 --> 48:37.005
The best-known
circumpolar constellation

48:37.038 --> 48:38.673
of the northern sky?

48:38.706 --> 48:40.175
Mm-mm-hm.

48:40.208 --> 48:42.376
Huh?

48:46.146 --> 48:50.117
That really is a great bear.

48:50.150 --> 48:52.886
Ok, guys, I can handle this.

48:55.222 --> 48:57.625
It's too big. Ugh!

48:57.657 --> 49:02.429
No, no, that's ursa minor,
the little bear.

49:04.431 --> 49:07.668
- This is the great bear.
- Huh?

49:20.014 --> 49:21.483
Huh?

49:28.922 --> 49:31.358
Argh!
I told you never to come here.

49:31.391 --> 49:33.594
How I missed you,
my little darling!

49:33.628 --> 49:35.730
Mwah!

49:35.762 --> 49:37.331
Eugh. Argh!

49:37.364 --> 49:39.099
You shouldn't be here.

49:39.132 --> 49:41.568
I've come straight from
the nightfairy's place.

49:41.601 --> 49:46.074
It's unbearable how
full of herself she is. Ugh!

49:46.106 --> 49:48.143
And her parties are so dull.

49:49.710 --> 49:51.880
But when I want to
singe someone for fun,

49:51.913 --> 49:54.681
you know, to lighten things up
a bit, they all yell at me!

49:54.715 --> 49:56.584
"Oh, lightning witch,
maybe you shouldn't"

49:56.617 --> 49:58.119
"burn people alive anymore."

49:58.152 --> 49:59.887
Oh, puh-lease!

49:59.920 --> 50:04.491
Sweetheart, you can't be wicked
and popular at the same time.

50:06.360 --> 50:10.798
But I'm only wicked
because no-one likes me,

50:10.831 --> 50:12.267
except you.

50:12.300 --> 50:14.602
- Argh!
- Whoo! Shocking.

50:14.635 --> 50:16.771
So, what brings you to the moon?

50:16.804 --> 50:19.139
A human boy is on his way here.

50:19.172 --> 50:22.376
He wants to rescue
his sister, Anne.

50:22.409 --> 50:24.112
Ah, petey!

50:24.144 --> 50:25.713
And who, pray tell, is Anne?

50:25.746 --> 50:28.081
The last thing I need
is more problems.

50:28.114 --> 50:33.420
At sunrise, my moon Cannon
will be ready.

50:33.454 --> 50:37.192
Then I will finally take revenge
on the nightfairy!

50:37.224 --> 50:39.993
I will raze her palace
to the ground.

50:40.027 --> 50:43.530
And then I will rule over
the whole universe!

50:43.563 --> 50:45.766
- We will.
- Oh. What?

50:45.800 --> 50:50.305
We will rule over
the whole universe, together!

50:50.338 --> 50:53.041
Oh, yes.

50:53.074 --> 50:55.242
Yes, of course, pumpkin.

50:55.275 --> 50:58.579
Of course I mean 'we'
when I say 'i'.

50:58.612 --> 51:03.884
Oh, my, you are so romantic.

51:03.918 --> 51:08.990
Mmmm. Ooh! Do you want to
destroy him with this?

51:09.023 --> 51:11.358
Oh, no, honey bunny!

51:11.391 --> 51:14.728
I'm gonna destroy them
with this!

51:16.764 --> 51:21.736
Now fly back quickly before
the others notice your absence.

51:21.768 --> 51:24.805
- And keep me posted.
- Mmmm.

51:24.838 --> 51:26.206
Ooh!

51:26.239 --> 51:27.942
Ok, 'bye.

51:29.342 --> 51:31.913
Oh, that electric psycho freak.

51:31.945 --> 51:32.980
Huh? Huh?

51:33.014 --> 51:36.851
And that nasty stench
of brimstone. Eugh!

51:36.884 --> 51:40.755
What now? Ah! Sweetheart!

51:40.788 --> 51:42.056
Yoo-hoo!

51:42.088 --> 51:45.793
Hi, sorry, but the shooting
stars I kidnapped for you,

51:45.826 --> 51:49.097
well, they've turned your moon
into a playground.

51:49.130 --> 51:50.832
- Are you ok with that?
- Oh, jeez.

51:50.864 --> 51:54.234
If you want a job done properly,
you do it yourself.

51:57.672 --> 52:00.875
Come on, let's go catch us
some flashbulbs.

52:01.876 --> 52:03.411
Hmm? Ahh!

52:03.443 --> 52:06.114
- Hey, psst!
- Who... who are you?

52:06.146 --> 52:08.415
Psst! I'm mrs zoomzeman.

52:08.449 --> 52:11.318
The moonman keeps me here
as his prisoner.

52:21.561 --> 52:26.034
What the...? How could
this happen, you dummies?

52:26.067 --> 52:27.434
- Ouch!
- I'm sorry, boss.

52:27.467 --> 52:29.503
One of the shooting stars
had to wee-wee...

52:29.536 --> 52:31.938
- Yeah.
- Wee-wee?

52:31.972 --> 52:36.911
Argh! What kind of shooting star
has to wee-wee?

52:36.943 --> 52:39.047
They call her Anne.

52:39.079 --> 52:40.914
Anne? Hmm.

52:40.947 --> 52:44.251
What are you doing
still standing here?

52:44.284 --> 52:46.987
Go catch her,
you wastes of space!

52:47.021 --> 52:48.022
Yes, yes, yes!

52:48.054 --> 52:52.092
Oh, dumb chain!
I'm just not strong enough.

52:54.295 --> 52:57.365
How long have you been
a prisoner here?

52:57.398 --> 53:00.635
I was snagged on a twig
of the birch tree

53:00.668 --> 53:02.603
when it was sent to the moon.

53:02.635 --> 53:04.371
And the moonman has made me

53:04.405 --> 53:07.608
do his bookkeeping
and tax returns ever since.

53:07.641 --> 53:08.742
Ohh.

53:08.775 --> 53:12.547
I don't know what that is,
but it sounds terrible.

53:12.579 --> 53:16.116
- Got you.
- One more.

53:23.724 --> 53:27.095
I wish you a pleasant journey.

53:27.128 --> 53:28.730
Wait, my little friend.

53:28.762 --> 53:32.599
Since these two dummies won't be
much help, take this here.

53:32.632 --> 53:35.202
If you need me, you can
call me with this charm.

53:35.235 --> 53:37.672
But please not between
5:00 and 6:00.

53:37.704 --> 53:40.273
I'll be bowling then.

53:40.306 --> 53:41.775
Oh... mmm.

53:41.809 --> 53:46.147
Take these presents and call us
if you need any help.

53:46.179 --> 53:49.583
I thank you all.

53:49.617 --> 53:52.019
'Bye!

53:53.653 --> 53:55.989
Let's go, mr sandman.

53:58.092 --> 53:59.860
To the moon!

53:59.893 --> 54:01.962
Whoa!

54:01.996 --> 54:04.965
Whoa! Whoa!

54:10.938 --> 54:13.108
Whoo!

54:17.311 --> 54:19.680
Whoa!

54:19.713 --> 54:23.050
Did you see that? Look, look!

54:23.083 --> 54:25.219
Ahh! I'll get bear-sick!

54:25.251 --> 54:27.087
- Ugh!
- Wow!

54:28.155 --> 54:30.725
Whooooa!

54:31.525 --> 54:34.262
- Ahh!
- The moon!

54:34.295 --> 54:36.864
How dare you run away from me!

54:38.431 --> 54:43.070
But I will let you go if...

54:44.871 --> 54:48.542
If you tell me
which one of you is Anne.

54:48.576 --> 54:50.110
Oh.

54:50.143 --> 54:52.646
Then I will only punish her!

54:52.679 --> 54:55.849
Punish her. Sweet.

54:58.351 --> 55:00.120
I am Anne!

55:00.153 --> 55:02.123
- I am Anne!
- I am Anne!

55:02.155 --> 55:04.057
I am Anne!

55:04.090 --> 55:07.194
Oh, they're driving me nuts.
Take care of them.

55:07.228 --> 55:08.628
Yeah, boss, ok.

55:08.661 --> 55:11.264
- Ha!
- What the...?

55:11.297 --> 55:14.234
Oh, Anne?

55:14.268 --> 55:16.204
Yes?

55:16.237 --> 55:19.407
Gotcha.

55:21.208 --> 55:23.610
Oh! Ohhhh! Ugh!

55:23.643 --> 55:25.579
I knew she was Anne
from the get-go.

55:25.612 --> 55:27.881
Come on, we got
more important things to do.

55:27.914 --> 55:30.650
Let me out! You just wait
until I'm free again!

55:30.684 --> 55:34.121
And I'll turn you into...
Unicorn poop!

55:34.153 --> 55:36.724
Shut up!

55:38.592 --> 55:41.496
Petey might not be
coming for me after all.

55:42.496 --> 55:45.298
Bring the shooting stars
into position now.

55:45.331 --> 55:47.167
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
consider it done, boss.

55:47.201 --> 55:50.103
- Um, one more thing, boss...
- What?

55:50.137 --> 55:51.806
One more thing.

55:51.838 --> 55:54.241
- Well, we were just thinking...
- We was thinking...

55:54.275 --> 55:56.677
- And, uh... we thought...
- We thought...

55:56.710 --> 55:59.679
- Well, we're men too, right?
- Hardly.

55:59.713 --> 56:02.750
- And we are on the moon, right?
- Really?

56:02.782 --> 56:05.752
One might argue that we
could also be called 'moonman'.

56:05.786 --> 56:07.922
- Yeah, I think it sounds good!
- Or moonmen.

56:07.954 --> 56:11.324
I'd be fine with moonman two
or moonman three

56:11.358 --> 56:14.195
or moonman b or moonman c...

56:14.228 --> 56:16.030
Have you lost your marbles?

56:17.864 --> 56:21.268
Has the thin air
gotten to your brains?

56:21.302 --> 56:24.171
I'm the moonman, nobody else!

56:24.204 --> 56:26.707
You two pathetic worms
can't even keep

56:26.739 --> 56:29.142
a bunch of grade school
shooting stars under control.

56:29.175 --> 56:30.744
Oh!

56:30.777 --> 56:32.513
Let's go!

56:37.050 --> 56:40.353
Why doesn't this
thing come with safety belts?

56:40.387 --> 56:42.690
Whoa-ho!

56:42.722 --> 56:46.594
Or at least a bear bag?

56:50.764 --> 56:53.001
Wow! The moon!

56:55.101 --> 56:59.172
I'll now take a step onto
the moon in my father's place...

56:59.206 --> 57:01.543
I wish he were here now.

57:02.342 --> 57:04.744
One small step for a beetle,

57:04.777 --> 57:08.281
one giant leap for beetle-kind!

57:08.315 --> 57:11.217
Huh! Whoa! Whaaaa!

57:15.289 --> 57:17.458
You ok, zoomzeman?

57:17.490 --> 57:20.126
Everything's okey-dokey, huh?
Feeling fine?

57:20.159 --> 57:22.396
Of course.

57:23.731 --> 57:26.701
- He's gone.
- 'Bye!

57:26.733 --> 57:28.936
- 'Bye!
- Farewell, my furry friend.

57:28.969 --> 57:32.706
- 'Bye!
- So, how do we find the moonman?

57:32.739 --> 57:36.343
Over there, on moon mountain.

57:36.376 --> 57:39.614
Oh.

57:39.646 --> 57:41.748
'Bye...

57:41.782 --> 57:45.486
Oh! Hey, humans!
Some of us have short legs!

57:45.518 --> 57:48.822
Ah, there they are,
the good, the bug and the ugly.

57:48.856 --> 57:51.359
Sic the poodles on them.

57:51.391 --> 57:53.360
- Aye-aye, boss.
- Aye-aye, boss.

57:53.393 --> 57:55.929
- Hey, come on, stupid.
- Yeah, ok.

58:01.367 --> 58:03.570
Oh.

58:11.010 --> 58:14.114
Huh? Oh.

58:14.148 --> 58:15.617
Hmmm.

58:17.550 --> 58:20.688
Uh? Huh?

58:20.721 --> 58:24.057
Do you hear that?

58:25.259 --> 58:27.293
Ho!

58:27.327 --> 58:29.397
Oh! They're coming!

58:29.429 --> 58:34.668
Dogs, barking, a whole pack
of 'em!

58:34.702 --> 58:37.972
Hold on now, zoomzeman.
What sort of pack?

58:38.005 --> 58:39.907
What kind of dogs?

58:39.940 --> 58:42.175
- Poodles!
- Poodles?

58:42.208 --> 58:46.112
Oh, no, the moon poodles!

58:46.146 --> 58:49.115
- But are they really dangerous?
- We're in trouble!

58:49.148 --> 58:51.117
- Don't worry.
- Ok!

58:51.150 --> 58:52.952
- There you are.
- I've got this!

58:57.423 --> 58:59.460
High five!

58:59.492 --> 59:01.228
Oh. Oh, no.

59:01.260 --> 59:03.130
Uh-oh!

59:03.163 --> 59:05.498
Oh, no!

59:05.532 --> 59:09.437
Now we are in trouble.
Follow me! Hurry up!

59:09.469 --> 59:11.672
Get in there, quick!

59:12.572 --> 59:15.175
Quicker! Quicker!
Please hurry up!

59:15.208 --> 59:17.611
- They're coming!
- Wait, I got it.

59:19.012 --> 59:20.782
Oh!

59:24.217 --> 59:25.752
Hurry! Hurry!

59:26.786 --> 59:28.588
Hip. Hop.

59:35.596 --> 59:36.764
Oh!

59:37.831 --> 59:41.268
A fiddle. Ah. Oh.

59:49.275 --> 59:51.211
- No!
- Ahh... ahh...

59:51.244 --> 59:53.380
Please don't! Stop! Don't!

59:53.413 --> 59:54.782
- Ah! Ah!
- No!

59:54.815 --> 59:57.117
Shhh!

59:57.985 --> 59:59.920
Ah-choo!

1:00:03.190 --> 1:00:04.592
Come here, mutt!

1:00:04.625 --> 1:00:07.027
We're looking for the sandman,

1:00:07.059 --> 1:00:08.795
a little boy and an ugly bug!

1:00:08.829 --> 1:00:13.134
Go! Get a move on!

1:00:14.367 --> 1:00:17.371
There we go. Oh,
I got to do everything myself!

1:00:17.403 --> 1:00:20.007
Oh, I'm gonna be in trouble
if I don't find them.

1:00:21.074 --> 1:00:22.610
They're gone.

1:00:22.643 --> 1:00:25.913
- Let's go home.
- Maybe we can fix this thing.

1:00:25.945 --> 1:00:27.447
You just wanna give up?

1:00:27.481 --> 1:00:30.184
Didn't you just see that?
They're hunting us down!

1:00:30.217 --> 1:00:32.253
And there are more of them
than us.

1:00:32.286 --> 1:00:34.688
But it's... it's you
who started all this.

1:00:34.721 --> 1:00:36.690
And I thought we're
the chosen human children.

1:00:36.722 --> 1:00:39.360
One can never be certain
about these things.

1:00:39.393 --> 1:00:41.996
And I get along ok
with three arms.

1:00:42.028 --> 1:00:44.898
Sure, there are a few spots
I can't scratch,

1:00:44.931 --> 1:00:47.534
but all in all,
it's fine, it's ok.

1:00:47.568 --> 1:00:49.203
I can't believe it! Sandman?

1:00:49.235 --> 1:00:53.106
You know, petey, sometimes
you just have to admit defeat.

1:00:53.139 --> 1:00:56.810
The sun will be up soon and we
should at least save ourselves.

1:00:56.844 --> 1:01:00.014
What?! I will not leave
my sister here all alone!

1:01:00.047 --> 1:01:03.583
And what about your shooting
stars? They're counting on you!

1:01:03.617 --> 1:01:06.187
What... what can we do anyway?

1:01:06.219 --> 1:01:07.687
A small boy, an old beetle

1:01:07.721 --> 1:01:11.559
and, let's be honest,
an undersized man.

1:01:15.295 --> 1:01:17.331
- Crap.
- Huh?

1:01:17.364 --> 1:01:19.199
Let me tell you something.

1:01:19.233 --> 1:01:21.735
Yesterday I started
at a new school,

1:01:21.768 --> 1:01:25.505
and there were some real bullies
out there who are out to get me.

1:01:25.539 --> 1:01:27.575
Just like you get bullied
by the other beetles,

1:01:27.608 --> 1:01:29.743
and you by the other
nature spirits.

1:01:29.775 --> 1:01:30.777
Who, me?

1:01:30.811 --> 1:01:34.849
They think we're losers
and cowards.

1:01:34.882 --> 1:01:36.817
They think they can
make fun of us

1:01:36.849 --> 1:01:38.885
'cause we don't
have our act together.

1:01:39.753 --> 1:01:42.456
You... you want to
prove them right?

1:01:44.423 --> 1:01:46.393
You're right, my boy.

1:01:46.425 --> 1:01:48.695
Yes, you are the chosen one.

1:01:48.728 --> 1:01:53.000
And we're not gonna let you
stop us, old sleepyhead!

1:01:53.032 --> 1:01:54.335
I stop you?

1:01:54.367 --> 1:01:57.938
Let's roll, fellow heroes!
Wha-hey!

1:01:57.971 --> 1:01:59.507
Agh!

1:02:01.474 --> 1:02:05.778
So, why is it you're always
playing dead, mr hero?

1:02:05.811 --> 1:02:08.481
Playing dead?
What are you talking about?

1:02:08.514 --> 1:02:11.351
- When did I do that?
- How about all the time?

1:02:11.385 --> 1:02:13.220
And you're always
falling asleep.

1:02:13.253 --> 1:02:17.391
That's an occupational hazard.
I have papers to prove it.

1:02:17.423 --> 1:02:19.463
They even give me the right
to use disabled parking.

1:02:19.492 --> 1:02:20.793
Blah, blah, blah.

1:02:20.827 --> 1:02:22.496
But I never said
I was giving up.

1:02:22.528 --> 1:02:24.498
That's not
what it sounded like to me!

1:02:24.530 --> 1:02:27.869
Tell him, petey.

1:02:30.170 --> 1:02:31.204
Hmm.

1:02:31.237 --> 1:02:32.505
Hmm?

1:02:38.445 --> 1:02:41.548
Here we go again.

1:02:41.581 --> 1:02:43.684
Are you nuts?

1:02:43.717 --> 1:02:46.887
- Stop it now, will ya?
- Aw, come on!

1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:49.856
Playing my fiddle helps me
when I'm scared.

1:02:49.889 --> 1:02:53.159
Uh-huh! And it helps
the moonman find us.

1:02:53.193 --> 1:02:54.662
Now I've got it.

1:02:54.695 --> 1:02:57.597
You're chasing away the poodles
with that screeching!

1:02:57.630 --> 1:03:00.867
Just a moment! I know that!

1:03:00.900 --> 1:03:03.369
What is that supposed to mean?

1:03:03.402 --> 1:03:06.973
My playing is smooth and lovely.

1:03:07.007 --> 1:03:11.345
For bugs maybe,
but they don't have ears.

1:03:11.378 --> 1:03:13.981
Of course they have ears!

1:03:14.014 --> 1:03:15.481
Oh, really? Where?

1:03:15.514 --> 1:03:18.351
- Show me!
- Quiet.

1:03:21.621 --> 1:03:24.925
God, could... could... could
that possibly be...

1:03:28.027 --> 1:03:30.296
Oh, my god! It's him!

1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:34.300
Ahhh.

1:03:34.333 --> 1:03:36.769
Oh, my god! It is her!

1:03:36.802 --> 1:03:40.373
What are you waiting for,
petey? Step on it!

1:03:40.407 --> 1:03:42.143
Alright. Let's go.

1:03:44.677 --> 1:03:48.449
Oh! It's him!

1:03:48.481 --> 1:03:51.719
Wow! Are they super-fast!

1:03:51.751 --> 1:03:54.054
A bit too fast...

1:03:54.086 --> 1:03:57.858
- I'm too young to die!
- Slow it down, petey!

1:03:57.891 --> 1:04:01.796
I'm trying, I'm trying!
But the brakes aren't working!

1:04:04.030 --> 1:04:06.000
Oh.

1:04:16.476 --> 1:04:20.881
Oh, zoomzeman.

1:04:24.150 --> 1:04:26.152
Zoomzeman.

1:04:26.186 --> 1:04:28.454
Mrs zoomzeman?

1:04:28.487 --> 1:04:30.390
I thought... I thought i'd...

1:04:30.423 --> 1:04:34.695
I thought I'd lost you forever
all those years ago.

1:04:36.228 --> 1:04:41.835
- Oh, zoomzeman.
- Mrs zoomzeman.

1:04:42.835 --> 1:04:45.805
Oh.

1:04:45.838 --> 1:04:48.442
- Petey!
- Huh?

1:04:50.844 --> 1:04:55.148
Oh. I almost always knew
that you would come.

1:04:55.181 --> 1:04:57.050
I'm so happy
that you're safe, Anne.

1:04:57.083 --> 1:05:01.387
I-I swear, I'll never
leave you alone again.

1:05:01.420 --> 1:05:04.190
- Come on!
- But where are you going?

1:05:04.224 --> 1:05:06.593
Home. Time is running out!

1:05:06.626 --> 1:05:08.461
- Look!
- But we can't!

1:05:08.494 --> 1:05:11.531
The moonman wants to conquer
the whole world!

1:05:11.565 --> 1:05:14.802
When the sun rises,
everything will be too late.

1:05:14.835 --> 1:05:17.336
Then we'll have to
stay here forever.

1:05:17.369 --> 1:05:20.007
I have promised to take you
safely back home.

1:05:20.039 --> 1:05:21.842
They need us here!

1:05:21.875 --> 1:05:26.045
The shooting stars,
mr zoomzeman and his arm

1:05:26.079 --> 1:05:27.514
and the nature spirits!

1:05:27.547 --> 1:05:31.851
I won't get myself into
your wild adventures again.

1:05:41.128 --> 1:05:43.530
You're all mine now, nightfairy.

1:05:43.563 --> 1:05:47.101
Get ready for lights out, baby!

1:05:48.601 --> 1:05:52.539
Look! The moon Cannon!

1:05:54.273 --> 1:05:57.710
That means the nightfairy
is in danger.

1:05:57.744 --> 1:06:00.948
Alright, so,
who's got a plan now?

1:06:00.981 --> 1:06:05.085
Oh, no! The moon poodles!

1:06:05.117 --> 1:06:08.456
And the two freaks again!

1:06:09.523 --> 1:06:11.925
There they are! Get 'em!

1:06:16.630 --> 1:06:19.800
- Uh-oh. No!
- Quick, run!

1:06:23.436 --> 1:06:25.838
I think I'd rather play dead!

1:06:25.871 --> 1:06:29.775
Oh, you selfish dung beetle!
Hurry up!

1:06:29.809 --> 1:06:32.046
- We still have these!
- Oh, no!

1:06:34.047 --> 1:06:38.152
Nature spirits,
I now call on you for help!

1:06:39.786 --> 1:06:41.655
Hmm.

1:06:41.688 --> 1:06:45.392
Hmmm.

1:06:45.425 --> 1:06:50.063
No, I made it clear -
not between 5:00 and 6:00!

1:06:56.168 --> 1:06:58.471
Yeah!

1:06:58.505 --> 1:07:00.440
Triple strike!

1:07:00.472 --> 1:07:02.009
Huh?

1:07:02.041 --> 1:07:04.443
Oh, no! It's going to be tricky!

1:07:06.012 --> 1:07:08.382
Can we join your little party?

1:07:08.414 --> 1:07:09.849
Hey, how can we help?

1:07:09.882 --> 1:07:12.018
We're under attack!
You have to do something!

1:07:12.052 --> 1:07:15.122
Don't worry,
we'll keep them busy.

1:07:25.931 --> 1:07:29.869
Yeah, here comes the sun.
It'll be all over soon.

1:07:29.902 --> 1:07:31.971
It's showtime, baby.

1:07:33.139 --> 1:07:35.142
Let's toast the nightfairy!

1:07:35.175 --> 1:07:37.277
Oh, it's them again!

1:07:37.309 --> 1:07:41.648
No worries, my dear. Mwah.

1:07:42.449 --> 1:07:44.985
Just leave them to me.

1:07:45.818 --> 1:07:49.789
Oh, I've got you now!

1:07:49.822 --> 1:07:52.559
Stop running away!

1:07:53.659 --> 1:07:54.827
Ah!

1:07:57.429 --> 1:07:59.065
- Yah!
- Yah!

1:07:59.099 --> 1:08:00.834
Yah!

1:08:00.867 --> 1:08:04.403
Come on, tiger,
we'll distract her.

1:08:04.436 --> 1:08:06.739
'Cause we're heroes, after all!
Whoo-hoo!

1:08:06.773 --> 1:08:09.576
La-la-la-la!

1:08:09.608 --> 1:08:11.110
Yah!

1:08:11.143 --> 1:08:13.379
That was close.

1:08:13.413 --> 1:08:14.981
- Thank you.
- Huh?

1:08:15.014 --> 1:08:17.684
You're the best annoying little
sister anyone could ask for.

1:08:17.716 --> 1:08:21.220
And you're the best
idiot brother in the world!

1:08:21.253 --> 1:08:23.289
There's really no time for that.

1:08:23.323 --> 1:08:25.492
Come on, let's save
the shooting stars!

1:08:25.524 --> 1:08:26.792
Yeah!

1:08:26.826 --> 1:08:28.929
Ah! Ow! Ah! Ow!

1:08:28.962 --> 1:08:32.499
- All aboard! Ah-whoo!
- And we'll stop the moonman!

1:08:32.532 --> 1:08:35.702
Huh?

1:08:40.974 --> 1:08:45.244
Come on! Come on! Yah!

1:08:48.715 --> 1:08:52.319
♪ Dear sandman, oh, sandman

1:08:52.351 --> 1:08:54.820
♪ where have you been? ♪

1:08:54.854 --> 1:08:59.326

Oh, no! Not now!

1:09:07.399 --> 1:09:09.435
Wake up! Wake up!

1:09:09.469 --> 1:09:13.907

Oh, no! Oh, dear! Oh!

Ah.

1:10:00.153 --> 1:10:01.488
Ow!

1:10:02.322 --> 1:10:05.359
Y-Your majesty.

1:10:05.391 --> 1:10:06.525
I am sorry.

1:10:06.559 --> 1:10:08.161
Shall I sing you a lullaby?

1:10:08.194 --> 1:10:09.896
Oh! Ooh!

1:10:12.231 --> 1:10:13.466
Oh!

1:10:13.500 --> 1:10:16.670
That was just
a wet warning shot!

1:10:44.697 --> 1:10:46.432
Uh... ok.

1:10:46.466 --> 1:10:48.969
Hands off my Cannon!

1:10:49.002 --> 1:10:51.238
I'm not letting you
destroy everything!

1:10:51.270 --> 1:10:55.207
Really? Such a brave
little fellow, petey!

1:10:55.240 --> 1:10:56.777
My name is Peter!

1:10:56.810 --> 1:11:00.347
Ok, Peter. The two of us
are quite alike, you know.

1:11:00.380 --> 1:11:03.382
We could be friends,
more than friends.

1:11:03.416 --> 1:11:05.385
You could be my son!

1:11:05.417 --> 1:11:08.354
Come over to my side.
You won't regret it.

1:11:08.387 --> 1:11:10.289
I will never be your son!

1:11:10.323 --> 1:11:12.492
And I have all the friends
I need.

1:11:12.524 --> 1:11:16.862
Really? A crippled beetle?
A dozy nature spirit?

1:11:16.895 --> 1:11:18.364
Your cuckoo sister?

1:11:18.398 --> 1:11:21.101
Do you really want to be counted
among those losers?

1:11:23.101 --> 1:11:28.108
Come work with me.
I'll reward you handsomely.

1:11:29.442 --> 1:11:33.447
Ok, let's say I help you.
What's in it for me?

1:11:33.479 --> 1:11:35.481
Alright, now we're talkin'! Hah!

1:11:35.515 --> 1:11:38.218
The whole universe
divided by two.

1:11:38.251 --> 1:11:40.654
And what about
this lightning witch?

1:11:40.686 --> 1:11:43.256
That stupid spark plug?
I was just using her.

1:11:43.288 --> 1:11:45.125
So, you don't love her at all?

1:11:45.158 --> 1:11:47.360
What, are you nuts?

1:11:47.393 --> 1:11:48.828
As soon as this is over,

1:11:48.862 --> 1:11:51.163
I'm gonna send
that crazy chick packing.

1:11:51.197 --> 1:11:53.365
Maybe you two
should have a talk.

1:11:53.399 --> 1:11:55.535
Uh? Oh, hi!

1:11:55.568 --> 1:11:57.237
- Sweetheart.
- Darling!

1:11:57.270 --> 1:11:59.172
I didn't mean that
like it sounded.

1:11:59.204 --> 1:12:03.742
I think... I'm blowing...
A fuse!

1:12:08.448 --> 1:12:12.019
Hah.

1:12:13.219 --> 1:12:16.288
You can't stop it.

1:12:16.322 --> 1:12:17.891
It's too late!

1:12:20.827 --> 1:12:21.862
Oh, no!

1:12:24.764 --> 1:12:26.467
Huh?

1:12:27.867 --> 1:12:30.537
- How much do they pay us again?
- Not enough!

1:12:31.637 --> 1:12:33.673
- Oh!
- Oh, dear.

1:12:34.673 --> 1:12:35.975
Oh! Help!

1:12:39.546 --> 1:12:42.916
Oh, dear. Ohhhhhh!

1:12:52.057 --> 1:12:54.226
Oh, that was very, very close.

1:12:54.260 --> 1:12:56.061
Very good that I have umbrella.

1:12:56.095 --> 1:12:58.899
This is not ok!

1:12:58.931 --> 1:13:02.135
He is going to be
extremely sorry for this!

1:13:02.167 --> 1:13:04.737
That, uh... what's his name?

1:13:04.770 --> 1:13:09.076
- Whose fault was this again?
- Ahhh... not me.

1:13:12.211 --> 1:13:15.248
I'm oh so sorry.

1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:18.484
I've made a royal mess
of things.

1:13:18.518 --> 1:13:21.020
The moonman was such a charmer,

1:13:21.054 --> 1:13:23.289
but he just used me.

1:13:23.323 --> 1:13:25.492
And all just because

1:13:25.524 --> 1:13:29.395
I was oh so lonely.

1:13:29.429 --> 1:13:31.998
That's not written
in stone, you know.

1:13:32.030 --> 1:13:35.501
If you were
just a bit friendlier.

1:13:35.534 --> 1:13:39.372
What for?
Nobody likes me anyway.

1:13:39.404 --> 1:13:43.009
Well, I'm not so sure
about that.

1:13:43.042 --> 1:13:48.515
Oh, my lovely, lovely,
pretty, little pappadum. Hoo!

1:13:50.015 --> 1:13:51.350
Hey?

1:13:51.384 --> 1:13:53.353
Hey!

1:13:53.386 --> 1:13:56.089
Petey! Petey!

1:13:56.122 --> 1:13:58.124
- Anne!
- Oh, we made it!

1:14:02.895 --> 1:14:04.364
Oh!

1:14:04.396 --> 1:14:05.966
Get off me!

1:14:05.998 --> 1:14:07.434
Oh!

1:14:09.969 --> 1:14:11.672
Where is the villain?

1:14:15.507 --> 1:14:18.110
You shall atone
for this outrage.

1:14:18.144 --> 1:14:22.382
I herewith ban you to...
To Mars.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:24.317
Huh? To where?

1:14:32.457 --> 1:14:36.395
Hey. This ain't quite
the grand hotel, is it?

1:14:36.429 --> 1:14:40.300
I will take vengeance for that.

1:14:40.332 --> 1:14:43.335
Oh? Huh?

1:14:43.368 --> 1:14:49.274
I will take vengeance for that!

1:14:51.010 --> 1:14:52.512
I thank you, dear children.

1:14:52.545 --> 1:14:56.582
It is only with your help
that we...

1:14:56.615 --> 1:14:58.551
Here today, um...

1:14:58.583 --> 1:15:00.886
Because you, uh...

1:15:00.920 --> 1:15:04.056
You have... um, have...

1:15:04.090 --> 1:15:06.426
Saved the universe!

1:15:06.458 --> 1:15:10.229
Right, exactly.
Saved the universe.

1:15:10.262 --> 1:15:12.832
Oh, that's nice.
A job well done.

1:15:12.864 --> 1:15:16.435
And you, lightning witch,
you have collab...

1:15:16.469 --> 1:15:18.371
Uh, um... collab...

1:15:18.404 --> 1:15:22.108
Oh, you know, with our enemy.
That's not cool.

1:15:22.140 --> 1:15:25.010
No? It's really unfair.

1:15:25.043 --> 1:15:27.447
But I see you're sorry
for your treachery,

1:15:27.479 --> 1:15:29.715
so your punishment will be mild.

1:15:29.748 --> 1:15:32.652
Three months lightning ban.

1:15:32.685 --> 1:15:35.655
And rainy Robin will make sure
that you stick to it.

1:15:35.688 --> 1:15:38.425
And you will give petey
your amulet,

1:15:38.457 --> 1:15:41.627
and be at his command
whenever he needs your help.

1:15:41.661 --> 1:15:42.595
Thank you.

1:15:42.627 --> 1:15:44.863
And what about
mr zoomzeman's little arm?

1:15:44.896 --> 1:15:46.632
- Arm?
- Yeah!

1:15:46.666 --> 1:15:48.802
- Which arm?
- His arm.

1:15:48.835 --> 1:15:50.302
Whose arm?

1:15:50.336 --> 1:15:52.072
That thing there.

1:15:56.208 --> 1:15:58.211
Oh, yes, that arm!

1:15:58.243 --> 1:15:59.645
Yes, of course.

1:15:59.679 --> 1:16:02.815
That gets reattached
to the beetle.

1:16:05.184 --> 1:16:06.351
Oooh!

1:16:06.385 --> 1:16:07.987
Ha ha!

1:16:08.020 --> 1:16:09.889
Oh! Oh? Oh!

1:16:12.824 --> 1:16:15.528
And the birch tree
goes back to earth.

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:17.329
- Oh!
- Huh?

1:16:18.029 --> 1:16:21.201
Oooh! The prophecy
is thereby fulfilled.

1:16:21.234 --> 1:16:23.336
Ooh, how does it feel?

1:16:23.368 --> 1:16:26.739
Ah-ha. Ah-ha! Ah-ha!

1:16:28.306 --> 1:16:29.908
Here I am!

1:16:29.942 --> 1:16:33.212
Who needs the aid
of the mighty storm giant,

1:16:33.246 --> 1:16:34.614
master of tornado and hurric...

1:16:34.646 --> 1:16:36.216
Save your breath, stormy.

1:16:36.248 --> 1:16:38.050
You're too late.

1:16:38.083 --> 1:16:39.853
Hmmm.

1:16:39.886 --> 1:16:42.622
There might still be
one thing you could do. Hmm!

1:16:44.623 --> 1:16:47.493
- Looks much better now.
- Yeah!

1:16:47.527 --> 1:16:50.497
That was quite
the exciting trip, you two.

1:16:50.529 --> 1:16:52.231
Many thanks for everything.

1:16:52.265 --> 1:16:56.169
Children are actually quite
nice, even when they're awake.

1:16:56.202 --> 1:16:57.737
Who would have thought?

1:16:57.770 --> 1:17:01.374
All that's left for me
is to finish my job.

1:17:01.407 --> 1:17:03.143
- What do you mean?
- Huh?

1:17:03.176 --> 1:17:05.311
I mean...

1:17:05.344 --> 1:17:08.181
Huh?

1:17:10.483 --> 1:17:12.552
Rise and shine,
sleepyheads. Come on!

1:17:12.585 --> 1:17:14.587
- Huh?!
- Petey! Anne!

1:17:15.621 --> 1:17:19.292
Ohh. I had the weirdest dream.

1:17:19.324 --> 1:17:22.261
Me too.

1:17:22.295 --> 1:17:24.730
Huh? Whoa!

1:17:26.431 --> 1:17:29.135
Hurry up, or you'll
be late for school.

1:17:33.271 --> 1:17:35.942
- Oh, my god!
- Huh?

1:17:39.244 --> 1:17:40.947
- Huh?
- Huh? No!

1:17:40.979 --> 1:17:42.715
Don't, mom!

1:17:48.688 --> 1:17:50.390
Bye-bye.
