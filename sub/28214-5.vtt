to our class was missing.

08:27.681 --> 08:31.032
Are you being sarcastic?No. No, never.

08:43.174 --> 08:44.828
Thank you for calling
Consult a Lawyer.

08:45.002 --> 08:48.353
This is Maia. Please tell me
a little about your issue,

08:48.528 --> 08:50.355
and go slowly
so I can take notes.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.532
[phone vibrating]

09:03.543 --> 09:04.979
GORDON:You act like
we're all robots.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.155
You arerobots.
Trump says Russia is good,

09:07.329 --> 09:09.200
and all Republicans
fall in lockstep.

09:09.374 --> 09:11.072
And that's why you
guys lose elections.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.900
'Cause you look
down on everyone.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.423
Excuse me.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.468
The midterms.
You'd call that a loss?

09:16.643 --> 09:18.079
Two Senate seats
flipped Republican.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.602
I'd hardly call that a win.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.256
His T-shirt.

09:24.825 --> 09:25.826
Let's challenge.

09:31.788 --> 09:34.008
It's electioneering.It's a T-shirt.

09:34.182 --> 09:35.487
GORDON: A T-shirt displaying
a political message.Sir?

09:35.662 --> 09:36.793
Sir, could you

09:36.967 --> 09:38.447
come over here, please?

09:38.621 --> 09:40.318
That's not
electioneering.

09:40.492 --> 09:41.972
Is marijuana
one of the candidates?

09:42.146 --> 09:43.321
Referencing a Democratic
campaign slogan.

09:43.495 --> 09:45.323
That wasn't a campaign slogan.

09:45.497 --> 09:46.847
It wasn't even
from this election.JUDGE SIG: Wait. Enough!

09:47.021 --> 09:48.849
Give me a second here.What's the problem?

09:49.023 --> 09:52.156
Sir, you can't enter
this polling place to vote.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.636
Come on!You are welcome

09:53.810 --> 09:56.508
to return in
a content-neutral shirt later.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.510
I have to head to work.I'm sorry.
Rules are rules.

09:58.685 --> 10:01.992
You can come back later to vote
in a content-neutral shirt.

10:02.166 --> 10:03.777
One vote could mean the
difference in this election.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.517
What if he takes his shirt off?

10:07.258 --> 10:10.261
Right. It's not electioneering
if he's not in his shirt.

10:10.435 --> 10:12.176
You want him to vote
without a shirt?
Why not?
There's no law against it.

10:12.350 --> 10:13.613
Yes, but it offends
the decorum of the inst...

10:13.787 --> 10:15.005
Of what, this cafeteria?

10:15.179 --> 10:16.528
Sir, if you prefer,
you can vote now,

10:16.703 --> 10:18.356
but you'll have
to take off your shirt.

10:18.530 --> 10:20.097
But you don't have to.Excuse me.
Let him decide for himself.

10:20.271 --> 10:21.969
KIMBERLY:
It's chilly in here.
That's all we're saying.

10:22.143 --> 10:24.058
LUCCA: No, it's not that cold.It's his decision.
Stop talking.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.625
JAY: You're the one
not letting him decide.JUDGE SIG: Hold on. Hold on!

10:25.799 --> 10:27.148
It's up to you, sir.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.367
You can vote now
if you take off your shirt,

10:29.541 --> 10:31.543
but you don't have to.

10:37.462 --> 10:39.334
All right.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.378
LUCCA:
Great choice, sir.

10:40.552 --> 10:41.858
MAN:
I can go vote now?

10:42.032 --> 10:42.859
Yes, sir.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.035
Cool.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.257
Congratulations.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.998
Okay, that's offensive.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.782
A swastika doesn't mean
a Republican voter, so...

10:52.956 --> 10:54.741
JUDGE SIG:
All of you outside again. Go.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.786
DIANE:
Are you sure, Joy?

10:56.960 --> 11:00.834
Because we've been working
on your case for two years now.

11:01.008 --> 11:03.924
Yeah, but faster isn't
necessarily good.[knock on door]

11:04.098 --> 11:05.360
It's this desk here.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.014
I want locks on
all of the drawers.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.320
Listen, uh, Joy, this
is what I'm asking.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.148
Just give us...

11:11.322 --> 11:13.368
Joy?

11:14.412 --> 11:16.153
Diane. Anything?

11:16.327 --> 11:17.415
Yup.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.722
21 of our class
signed with Blum.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.203
He's promising them
results in 48 hours,

11:22.377 --> 11:24.031
instead of the years
that we have taken.

11:24.205 --> 11:25.859
He's on his way in here now.What?

11:26.033 --> 11:27.730
Here?Mm-hmm. Yeah, my guess?

11:27.904 --> 11:29.036
[drill whirring]He just wants
the five percent finder's fee,

11:29.210 --> 11:31.516
and he'll just bow out.

11:31.691 --> 11:34.215
The man hates to work.

11:34.389 --> 11:35.782
DIANE:
Uh, Marissa,

11:35.956 --> 11:38.306
do you know who Roland Blum is?

11:40.047 --> 11:41.657
What's the matter?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.441
You mean, besides the fact
my best friend was fired?

11:43.615 --> 11:46.009
You know I had nothing
to do with that.I know she has

11:46.183 --> 11:48.838
no money, and she's working
at Consult a Lawyer.All right.

11:49.012 --> 11:51.362
I'm calling three top firms
who might be interested in her,

11:51.536 --> 11:53.582
so she won't be stuck there.
Don't worry.

11:53.756 --> 11:56.237
Now, can I ask
for your help?

11:56.411 --> 11:58.195
Roland Blum-- he's coming here
in a few minutes.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.068
I need you to stick with him
the entire time that he's here.

12:01.242 --> 12:04.462
He has stolen from us before,
and he will try it again.Okay.

12:04.636 --> 12:05.855
Don't worry.
We will take care of Marissa.

12:06.029 --> 12:07.117
I'm Marissa.

12:09.163 --> 12:12.122
Yes. We will take care of Maia.

12:12.296 --> 12:14.516
I'm sorry. I'm distracted.ROLAND: Yeah,
what floor am I on?

12:14.690 --> 12:16.779
There he is. Watch him.This is where I'm going?

12:16.953 --> 12:19.434
I hate this fucking place.
Look at it.

12:19.608 --> 12:21.305
ROLAND:
We attack now.

12:21.479 --> 12:24.874
Shoot 'em in the face
while they're still smiling.

12:25.048 --> 12:26.397
We're not ready.Yeah.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.790
You haven't been ready
for two and a half years.

12:27.964 --> 12:29.139
What are you waiting for?!

12:29.313 --> 12:30.967
DIANE:
Evidence, witnesses.

12:31.141 --> 12:32.882
We have a whistle-blower who's
the cornerstone of our case.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.492
I guess you wouldn't
know about that,

12:34.666 --> 12:36.059
having stolen your way
into this.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.800
Oh, my God! Bullshit!

12:37.974 --> 12:40.455
Bullshit! This is not
a fucking book report.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.065
You're not entitled
to, uh, extra credit

12:42.239 --> 12:43.284
because you made a graph.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.852
I say we go to court now, today!

12:46.026 --> 12:47.810
You don't win
a case in a day.

12:47.984 --> 12:49.681
We're not trying
to win this case.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.162
We're trying to scare the shit
out of the other side

12:52.336 --> 12:53.773
so they settle. Hi.

We'll discuss.

If what you're threatening

13:17.753 --> 13:21.017
is a Hundred Years' War,
Second Helix doesn't care.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.193
So you think
they're siding with me?

14:07.585 --> 14:09.500
Nope.I think you're right.

Oh, you overplayed your hand.

19:43.573 --> 19:45.836
That was $3 million
to end this.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.621
We'll never pay another cent.

19:47.795 --> 19:49.362

19:56.195 --> 19:58.545
Okay.[laughs]

19:58.719 --> 20:00.416
Yeah.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.854
It had to happen.

20:04.028 --> 20:05.943
Three million was
highway robbery.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.947

not pro-choice.

20:25.354 --> 20:26.964
Why do you have so much trouble
just saying it?

20:27.138 --> 20:28.618
Because it's not true.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.577
I want women to
have the option.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.231
Okay, in no other debate
are euphemisms

20:32.405 --> 20:34.189

by the press.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.278
Well, what about pro-life?
You have the same problem.

20:36.452 --> 20:38.062
I'll take anti-abortion.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.326
I'll wear that one proudly,
because that's what I am.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.110
But you have to take
"pro-abortion," then.

If this trait doesn't describe
you, take one step away.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.970
So, what does this do?It's a diversity game.

21:16.144 --> 21:19.060

and I have the African Americans

21:19.234 --> 21:21.410

African American friends

You wanted me to show you what
sensitivity training looks like,

"I like singing."

take one step backwards.

Oh. Sorry.

22:13.419 --> 22:15.246
Uh, we need some help here.

22:15.421 --> 22:17.466
There are a lot
of Red Jackets gathering.

22:17.640 --> 22:18.467
What, at the polling place?

22:18.641 --> 22:19.816
Yes. We've had...

22:19.990 --> 22:22.341
five cars of black voters
drive off.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.038
It's an attempt at
voter suppression.

There goes another one.

by seven votes last election.

anyone at the moment.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.004
Uh, we've got
an emergency motion in court.

22:34.178 --> 22:36.180
It would take someone two hours
to get there anyway.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.357
Diane, this looks like
a riot forming.

22:38.531 --> 22:41.534

Hi, it's me. I need your help.

calling each other.

22:58.420 --> 23:00.291

23:00.466 --> 23:03.207
I have some poll watchers
at the 14th.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.514
There are about 50 Red Jackets
who showed up

to your husband, Ms. Harper?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.271
Uh, Your Honor,
this isn't a trial.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.273

an expedited hearing.

Your Honor, that is what
I've had to deal with.

23:31.366 --> 23:34.369
To decide on either motion,
I have to hear on the subject

23:34.543 --> 23:37.981

continue, Ms. Harper.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.070
And, Mr. Blum, shut up.

23:42.246 --> 23:44.074
MOLLY:My husband Harlan decided
to try one of those

23:44.248 --> 23:46.903
home genetics kits
from Second Helix.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.253
That would be... one of these?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.385
Yes.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.692
Harlan thought
it would be fun.

23:52.866 --> 23:56.043
He'd heard he had Irish ancestry
and wanted to find out.

23:56.217 --> 23:58.785
And when the test results
came back, what did you learn?

23:58.959 --> 24:02.179
Harlan had the gene
for atrial fibrillation--

24:02.353 --> 24:03.877
a heart condition--

24:04.051 --> 24:05.618
that he was at high
risk for stroke.

24:05.792 --> 24:06.793
Obviously, we were scared.

24:06.967 --> 24:08.490
Got two little girls
at home.

24:08.664 --> 24:12.276
So we decided
to get life insurance.

24:12.451 --> 24:15.976
This way, if something happened,
we would have help.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.892
But the insurance company
denied coverage?
Yes.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.677
They said that Harlan had
a preexisting condition.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.070
Mm.

24:23.244 --> 24:25.202
The gene for
atrial fibrillation.

this from Second Helix?

24:28.379 --> 24:29.772

ADRIAN: Molly, what happened
to your husband after he was

24:34.560 --> 24:36.779
denied insurance?He had a stroke.

24:36.953 --> 24:41.349
He died, and the bills
kept piling up.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.178
So you and 44 other
members of the class,

24:44.352 --> 24:45.745
you want compensation
from Second Helix

24:45.919 --> 24:49.357
for sharing private information
that prevented you

24:49.531 --> 24:51.881
from protecting
your family?Yes.

30:09.024 --> 30:10.243
Who is this?

30:10.417 --> 30:12.375
It's Arthur Garber,
Blum's dietician.

30:12.549 --> 30:14.464
You're kidding.No. He has a fluid sense
of job descriptions.

30:14.638 --> 30:17.337
Why? What was he supposed to be
on the stand?

30:17.511 --> 30:19.165
A life insurance whistle-blower.

30:19.339 --> 30:21.210
[gasps] Oh, my God.Call these numbers.

30:21.384 --> 30:22.951
These are top firms.
Seriously, Maia.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.779
This place is depressing me.

30:27.129 --> 30:29.740
If you don't call
them, I will.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.742
Right, yeah.
Got it, Diane.

30:31.917 --> 30:33.875
Amazing. Thanks.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.703
This is like a telethon.

30:35.877 --> 30:37.487
Who are you calling now?

30:37.661 --> 30:39.054
The police.

30:39.228 --> 30:41.056
I thought they weren't
breaking the law.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.015
Yeah, they weren't.
But two of them

30:43.189 --> 30:45.104
are registered sex offenders
who are currently within

30:45.278 --> 30:46.757
500 feet of a school.

30:46.932 --> 30:49.456
Hi, could I speak to
a detective, please?

30:49.630 --> 30:52.111
Hello, yeah.
This is Lucca Quinn.

30:52.285 --> 30:55.114
I'd like to report
two registered sex offenders

30:55.288 --> 30:58.900
in the parking lot of Phyllis
Wheatley Elementary School.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.946
Yup, I can hold.

31:03.905 --> 31:06.473
Uh, yes, I'm here.

31:06.647 --> 31:08.692
MARISSA:
He doesn't work
at Barnaby Insurance.

31:08.867 --> 31:09.868
He's Blum's dietician.

31:10.042 --> 31:11.043
Oh, dear God.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.348
How do we know this?

31:12.522 --> 31:14.220
Maia. She was
with him for five days.

31:14.394 --> 31:15.786
You don't think she's lying?

31:15.961 --> 31:18.050
Are you kidding me?
Don't believe her if you want,

31:18.224 --> 31:20.879
but stop asking me
to investigate, then.

31:23.098 --> 31:24.839
[sighs]
So what do we do now?

31:25.013 --> 31:26.667
We do nothing.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.756
It's the defense's case.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.758
My God, you're starting
to sound like Blum.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.455
[scoffs]Shouldn't we be
telling the judge?

31:32.629 --> 31:33.674
[Adrian gasps]

31:33.848 --> 31:34.805
[clears throat]

31:34.980 --> 31:36.807
Yes?

31:36.982 --> 31:38.809
No, I was just... just thinking.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.942
[elevator bell dings,
doors open]

31:48.254 --> 31:50.691
Uh, Fiona Novak,
founder and CEO of Second Helix.

31:50.865 --> 31:53.607
I guess that means
I'm the bad guy here.

31:53.781 --> 31:55.348
[laughs]:
Oh, no.

31:55.522 --> 31:56.915
But thank you for coming in
on such short notice.

31:57.089 --> 31:59.091
We know you're busy.

31:59.265 --> 32:03.530
Now, this is the, uh, standard,
uh, contract for Second Helix.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.749
When people send you

32:05.924 --> 32:10.580
a DNA sample to test, they agree
to the terms of this agreement?

32:10.754 --> 32:11.842
Yes, that is correct.

32:12.017 --> 32:13.279
Uh, would you
read the, uh,

32:13.453 --> 32:15.107
highlighted section
there, please?

32:15.281 --> 32:16.543
"I agree to share

32:16.717 --> 32:18.762
"the genetic information
contained herein

32:18.937 --> 32:20.808
with Second Helix,
its associates and affiliates."

32:20.982 --> 32:23.767
Can I see a copy of that?Of course.

32:23.942 --> 32:27.423
So, uh, when your customers
sign up with Second Helix,

32:27.597 --> 32:31.427
they are informed that
their genetic information

32:31.601 --> 32:34.996
will be shared and used because
that is part of the mission

32:35.170 --> 32:37.042
of your company?Absolutely.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.174
O-Our customers know
that we are committed

32:39.348 --> 32:41.307
to serious medical research.

32:41.481 --> 32:44.658
We've already got
a promising new drug for ALS.

32:44.832 --> 32:48.531
Your Honor, in light of Ms.
Novak's testimony, the defense

32:48.705 --> 32:51.752
moves to dismiss the case.ROLAND: Your Honor, uh,

32:51.926 --> 32:55.103
we'd like to recall Arthur
Garber as a rebuttal witness.

32:55.277 --> 32:56.844
Uh, just...

32:57.018 --> 32:59.803
[quietly]: You're not
putting him on the stand.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.936
Well, we can rebut
her testimony.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.807
He's your fucking dietician,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.332
and you're not putting him
on the stand.

33:10.292 --> 33:11.990
ROLAND:
Your Honor,
I've just been informed

33:12.164 --> 33:15.210
Mr. Garber is, uh, unavailable.JUDGE DUNAWAY: Okay.

33:15.384 --> 33:18.170
I'm ready to rule.
On the motion to dismiss,

33:18.344 --> 33:19.388
I am inclined
to agree with Mr. Andrews...

33:19.562 --> 33:20.737
Your Honor,
can I interrupt here?

33:20.911 --> 33:22.217
[gavel bangs]

33:22.391 --> 33:24.524
Oh, Y-Your Honor,
I-I didn't recognize you.

33:24.698 --> 33:26.526
I-Is there something you need?Yes.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.876
My apologies. I should've
come directly to you.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.792
But unfortunately, I need
Adrian Boseman in my court.

33:31.966 --> 33:35.665
Only for a few hours.
It's an emergency hearing.

33:35.839 --> 33:38.755
I understand. Well, um, we
could reconvene back here

33:38.929 --> 33:40.888
at 4:00 in the afternoon.

33:41.062 --> 33:42.890
Would that be enough time,
Your Honor?

33:43.064 --> 33:44.500
I believe it will.Good.

33:44.674 --> 33:47.416
Then I will rule
in three hours.[gavel bangs]

33:51.768 --> 33:54.380
[chuckles]:
Thanks for the reprieve.

33:54.554 --> 33:56.556
That wasn't for you.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.913
DIANE:
So what do you think?[Liz sighs]

34:06.087 --> 34:07.610
I think she's too much money
and it's stupid.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.917
Mm. But other than that?[laughs]

34:10.091 --> 34:12.267
Well, I mean, loo--
her-her point seems to be

34:12.441 --> 34:15.401
that if we all realized
how much we had in common,

34:15.575 --> 34:17.403
there'd be no more racism.

34:17.577 --> 34:19.100
That's not my experience.

34:19.274 --> 34:21.015
What is your experience?

34:21.189 --> 34:23.670
That human nature cannot be
solved by a sensitivity game.

34:23.844 --> 34:26.673
Okay, so I say we offer midyear
bonuses to all the associates.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.153
Call it a onetime windfall.

34:28.327 --> 34:30.198
They'll know
we're buying them off.

34:30.372 --> 34:31.634
Yeah, and we are.

34:31.808 --> 34:33.245
Yeah.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.986
Oh, we're gonna have
to convince the partners.

34:36.161 --> 34:38.902
It's gonna be a lot of money.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.949
$10,000 bonuses
over three years.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.563
So, Prince, huh?

34:48.869 --> 34:50.697
Yeah. Did that surprise you?

34:50.871 --> 34:52.568
Eh, well,
you know, I just

34:52.742 --> 34:57.007
thought you were more the, uh,
Renée Fleming type, you know?

Best thing in the world.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.607
[clears throat]

36:14.781 --> 36:18.306
A few weeks ago,
I got pulled over by a cop.

36:18.480 --> 36:22.049
He said my windows
were too dark.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.312
I let him play
his little power game.

36:24.486 --> 36:27.707
"Get out of the car, ma'am.
Stand by the curb, ma'am."

36:27.881 --> 36:29.535
I was polite.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.494
I got his name
and his badge number.

36:32.668 --> 36:35.497
I said, "Have a nice day, sir."

36:35.671 --> 36:38.979
Then I drove to court,
called his supervisor,

36:39.153 --> 36:41.503
and had them both come in
for a judicial examination.

36:41.677 --> 36:44.202
Boom.
[laughs]

36:44.376 --> 36:45.855
[both sigh]

36:46.029 --> 36:49.990
He didn't recognize me
at first, until I said,

36:50.164 --> 36:52.427
"Have a nice day, sir."

36:52.601 --> 36:54.342
Then his face.

36:54.516 --> 36:57.389
[laughs]:
Ooh, you should've seen it.

36:57.563 --> 37:01.828
He saw his whole world turn
upside down.

37:02.002 --> 37:05.092
He had a rush of shit
to the brain.

37:05.266 --> 37:08.226
[laughs]

37:08.400 --> 37:10.445
[sighs]

37:10.619 --> 37:13.231

37:13.405 --> 37:18.018
every single bad moment
in law school,

37:18.192 --> 37:20.629
it was worth it.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.025
You are so sexy.

37:42.042 --> 37:44.914
Hmm.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.221
So how long have you and Blum
been working together?

37:47.395 --> 37:49.310
[groans]

37:49.484 --> 37:51.269
About five hours.

37:51.443 --> 37:53.140

How you liking it?

37:53.314 --> 37:55.229
Oh, God.[laughs]

37:55.403 --> 37:58.928
Yeah, you two
are a lot alike.

Oh, no, we are not.Oh, yes, you are.

How do you know
Blum, anyhow?

38:16.032 --> 38:18.948

38:19.122 --> 38:22.735
He did... favors for people.

38:22.909 --> 38:25.303
Did he for you?

38:30.830 --> 38:34.703
Your head is like a sculpture.

38:34.877 --> 38:37.532
I want to cut it off
and put it on my desk.

38:37.706 --> 38:40.318
What favors did he do for you?

38:45.148 --> 38:47.499
[sighs]

38:47.673 --> 38:50.893
You have an opening
with your judge, you know.

38:51.067 --> 38:52.373
With Dunaway?

38:52.547 --> 38:54.288
What do you mean?He was supposed to be

38:54.462 --> 38:56.159
on a four-month
patent case,

38:56.334 --> 38:58.031
but they settled.

38:58.205 --> 39:00.990
He's looking for a cause.

39:01.164 --> 39:03.341
You can use that.

39:06.822 --> 39:07.954
Thanks for coming in.

39:08.128 --> 39:10.173
Uh, sorry,
what's your name again?

39:10.348 --> 39:12.132

39:12.306 --> 39:13.960

to have Diane Lockhart

39:14.134 --> 39:15.788
in your corner.[chuckles softly]

39:15.962 --> 39:17.790
Uh, how are you
with labor law?

39:17.964 --> 39:20.619
I've worked on several cases.
I know the latest statutes.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.621
Ah, good. You're exactly
what we're looking for.

39:22.795 --> 39:24.840
Oh. Well, that is great news.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.365
Yes. Do you think
you can start in November?

39:29.454 --> 39:32.239
Oh, I thought this was for now.

39:32.413 --> 39:34.633
No, it's a long-running
class action.

39:34.807 --> 39:36.809
We expect to be depo-dumped
at the end of the year.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.201
So, six months from now?

39:38.376 --> 39:41.248
Yes. Maybe seven.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.816
Oh, I'm sorry.
I-I need something now.

39:43.990 --> 39:46.253
I completely get it.
Uh, stay in touch

39:46.427 --> 39:49.038
if you're still available
in November.

39:54.304 --> 39:57.220
Did Diane know about
the late start date on this?

39:57.395 --> 39:59.962
I don't know.
I think so.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.010
Thank you.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.104

40:11.278 --> 40:12.714
Don't you have a life?

40:12.888 --> 40:15.630
You're my life.

40:15.804 --> 40:17.458
Ah, good of you
to show up.

40:17.632 --> 40:19.329
So we're heading
to court

40:19.504 --> 40:22.028
in one hour.ADRIAN: Yeah.
I've just been told

40:22.202 --> 40:23.856
that Judge Dunaway may be open
to a pivot on the case.

40:24.030 --> 40:25.553
Told by who?"Whom."

40:25.727 --> 40:27.425
Somebody in the know.Okay, so what's the pivot?

40:27.599 --> 40:30.515
I don't know.
We have an hour.

40:30.689 --> 40:32.778
We just need a lifeline.Well, we're not gonna

40:32.952 --> 40:34.693
win with a lifeline.It's not about winning.

40:34.867 --> 40:37.173
It's about scaring
the other side shitless.

40:37.347 --> 40:38.697
[laughs] Okay.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.089
Thank you.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.309
Okay, so we have

40:42.483 --> 40:43.832
a sympathetic client, you know?

40:44.006 --> 40:45.747
Judge liked her, started to cry.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.228
So we stick with her
and the class.

40:48.402 --> 40:51.318
So does that mean the pivot
is in the law or the facts?

40:51.492 --> 40:53.102
We still don't have the, uh,

40:53.276 --> 40:54.408
whistle-blower
connection?Uh-uh.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.410
The law.
ROLAND:
Okay.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.804
So do we attack
contract of adhesion?

40:58.978 --> 41:00.893
ADRIAN:Maybe. It was an
online contract.

41:01.067 --> 41:02.242
Wait a second.

50:45.129 --> 50:47.435
before I'll show you
the check.

50:47.609 --> 50:49.524
Look, we have no problem
working with you.

50:49.698 --> 50:52.092
But just us, not him.

50:55.226 --> 50:56.705
No.

50:56.879 --> 50:59.969
We don't want Roland Blum
running off making mischief.

51:00.144 --> 51:01.928
It's all of you or none of you.

51:02.102 --> 51:03.756
That's the string.

51:03.930 --> 51:07.455
You say no right now,
we'll see you back in court.

51:07.629 --> 51:08.978
Oh, way to make me
feel unwanted.

51:09.153 --> 51:10.589
I thought we had
something special.

51:11.938 --> 51:13.461
All right, we agree.

51:13.635 --> 51:16.029
Let's see the check.

51:20.555 --> 51:22.166
Hmm.

51:26.474 --> 51:27.736
Are you sure?

51:27.910 --> 51:29.825
I'm-I'm free tomorrow
for an interview.

51:32.306 --> 51:35.004
Yes, that's right.
Uh, Diane Lockhart set this up.

51:41.881 --> 51:43.535
Sure. Uh, yes.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.754
You-you want to meet
in four weeks?

51:45.928 --> 51:48.888
That sounds great.
Thank you.

51:58.854 --> 52:00.900
[exhales]

52:02.902 --> 52:04.947
[knock on door]

52:07.472 --> 52:08.951
Hi.

52:09.996 --> 52:11.345
Hi.
I'm sorry

52:11.519 --> 52:13.347
for not getting
in touch earlier.

52:13.521 --> 52:15.175
I've been trying to call.

52:15.349 --> 52:17.525
It was a really weird day.
Jay and I were poll-watching

52:17.699 --> 52:20.572
out in the middle of nowhere,
and there was a riot.

52:20.746 --> 52:22.617
A real riot.

52:25.490 --> 52:27.579
And I miss you, and I...

52:27.753 --> 52:30.886
I want to know what's going on,
so I thought we could maybe

52:31.060 --> 52:32.714
go grab dinner.

52:32.888 --> 52:35.543
Francesca could watch Joseph
for a few more hours.

52:35.717 --> 52:36.892
That's okay, Lucca.

52:37.066 --> 52:38.372
All right, so
let's get dinner.

52:38.546 --> 52:40.940
I'll pay.

52:43.029 --> 52:45.727
Come on, I-I feel awkward about
how things went down at work.

52:45.901 --> 52:49.296
You don't have to feel awkward.

52:49.470 --> 52:51.864
I know, but I-I do.

52:54.519 --> 52:56.956
Lucca, everything's fine.

52:59.698 --> 53:01.700
