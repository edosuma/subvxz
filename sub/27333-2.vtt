NICO:
Previously on Marvel's Runaways...

00:09.603 --> 00:11.524
LESLIE:
This means our kids are still running.

00:11.607 --> 00:13.151
TINA:
It's a 24 hour surveillance center.

00:13.235 --> 00:15.657
Wizard's state-of-the-art
facial recognition software.

00:15.740 --> 00:17.326
We're in charge of getting
our kids back now.

00:17.409 --> 00:19.540
-ALEX: We need more money.
- This time you gotta earn it.

00:19.623 --> 00:21.251
And put tape and shit
around the windows, man.

00:21.334 --> 00:23.171
I'm Livvie. Nice to meet you.

00:23.255 --> 00:24.382
What'd you say your name was?

00:24.465 --> 00:26.679
[wind howling]

00:26.762 --> 00:27.847
Choke.

00:28.933 --> 00:30.143

00:30.227 --> 00:31.229
GERT:
She's dead.

00:31.312 --> 00:33.275
Who's gonna get justice for Graciela?

00:33.358 --> 00:35.362
I don't want any more
innocent people getting hurt...

00:36.447 --> 00:37.867
and I can do something about it.

00:37.951 --> 00:39.036
NICO:
They're our parents.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.999
How could they be such monsters?

00:41.082 --> 00:42.502
We're not them.

00:42.586 --> 00:44.005
KAROLINA:
We can fix the world that they broke.

00:46.217 --> 00:47.261
-Aah!
-NICO: Karolina!

00:48.388 --> 00:51.227
Guys!
I found something.

00:52.564 --> 00:54.526
JONAH: If I'm gonna heal myself,
I need another box.

00:54.609 --> 00:56.029
Who could possibly help us?

00:56.112 --> 00:57.281
My wife.

00:57.364 --> 01:00.955
Nothing's more important than learning
about who and what you are.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.754
-What's happening?
-It's starting.

01:33.729 --> 01:38.405

-[objects rattling]

01:38.488 --> 01:39.866

01:39.950 --> 01:42.079
MOLLY:
What is this?

01:42.162 --> 01:43.248
CHASE:
Earthquake!

01:45.837 --> 01:46.880
Over here. Doorway--

01:49.343 --> 01:50.345
Aah!

01:51.932 --> 01:53.268
GERT:
Molly! Under here!

01:55.313 --> 01:57.694
[rumbling continues]

02:00.700 --> 02:02.161
-Gert!
-CHASE: Molly! No!

02:07.129 --> 02:08.591
Holy crap.

02:09.758 --> 02:10.928
[Molly grunting]

02:12.055 --> 02:14.477
Did you guys see that?

02:14.561 --> 02:17.483
[sighs] We're safe.
We survived.

02:18.527 --> 02:20.823
-[crash]
-[screaming]

02:27.127 --> 02:28.672
This place held, though.

02:28.756 --> 02:30.593
-[Old Lace growling]
-For now.

02:32.429 --> 02:35.060
Wait, guys... where's Karolina?

02:36.437 --> 02:38.984
KAROLINA:
You said something was starting.

02:39.068 --> 02:40.445
What?

02:40.530 --> 02:43.243
JONAH:
A journey... to a miraculous future.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.455
That doesn't answer my question.

02:45.540 --> 02:48.044
The answer is, you'll be meeting
your family very soon.

02:48.127 --> 02:51.217
My family? No, I--
I already have a family.

02:51.300 --> 02:52.720
-A mom--
-They're my family.

02:52.804 --> 02:54.306
And since you are, too...

02:57.605 --> 02:59.985
Of course, you can't
truly know who you are

03:00.068 --> 03:02.364
until you know what you are

03:02.447 --> 03:04.076
by mastering your power.

03:05.036 --> 03:06.999
Give me your bracelet.
It's only holding you back now.

03:07.082 --> 03:08.586
No. This is the thing
that turns my glow off.

03:08.669 --> 03:09.671
No, no. You're wrong.

03:09.754 --> 03:12.134
You've controlled it before...
at the dig site.

03:13.637 --> 03:15.516
-Yeah, but that was just instinct.
-Exactly.

03:15.600 --> 03:17.645
You didn't think you needed
the bracelet, so you didn't.

03:17.729 --> 03:21.110
You don't need anything
outside of yourself to control this power.

03:21.193 --> 03:23.031
It comes from within you.
It is you.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.079
Close your eyes.

03:49.458 --> 03:50.920
Find the light.

03:52.089 --> 03:53.341
Yes. Good.

03:53.424 --> 03:55.470
Now, without asking how...

03:55.554 --> 03:59.395
just... turn it off.

03:59.478 --> 04:02.317
-Wait, I don't know how to--
-[chuckling] Don't analyze.

04:08.037 --> 04:10.333
[laughs] I did that?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.377
You did that.

04:13.339 --> 04:14.926
I wanna do it again.

04:17.765 --> 04:19.017
That's my girl.

04:20.478 --> 04:22.692
[theme music playing]

05:32.164 --> 05:34.168
[Old Lace growling]

05:36.338 --> 05:37.675
GERT:
There's no sign of her upstairs.

05:37.758 --> 05:40.764
Although, pretty sure I saw, like,
rat-sized cockroaches back there.

05:40.848 --> 05:43.604
-[growling]
-Bite-sized Old Lace snacks.

05:43.687 --> 05:45.064
No. Gross.

05:47.695 --> 05:50.701
Fine. Who am I to judge the dietary
habits of a homeless dinosaur?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.622
[Old Lace roars and hisses]

05:56.796 --> 05:59.301
Guys! Focus. Karolina.

05:59.384 --> 06:01.138
Look. She's not in here injured,

06:01.222 --> 06:03.392
OK, which means she's out there,
probably totally fine.

06:03.476 --> 06:05.104
Except it might be worse out there.

06:05.188 --> 06:07.777
We need to partner up,
comb the area nearby.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.279
Or maybe we don't need
to go anywhere.

06:11.576 --> 06:14.289
Hey. Is everyone OK?

06:14.373 --> 06:16.460
Where were you?
We were worried.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.924
Sorry. I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a walk in the woods.

06:19.007 --> 06:20.678
I really didn't mean
to worry anyone.

06:24.978 --> 06:26.564
How bad is it out there?

06:26.648 --> 06:29.988
It's definitely way worse down here.
The rest of the world is still intact.

06:30.071 --> 06:31.992
OK. So this isn't the one that
Molly's parents warned us about.

06:32.075 --> 06:33.620
GERT:
Or it's the pre-shock to that one.

06:33.704 --> 06:35.874
We don't know if we permanently
shut down that construction site.

06:35.958 --> 06:37.460
You think they restarted the drill?

06:37.545 --> 06:39.131
That Jonah guy
seemed pretty determined.

06:39.214 --> 06:41.010
I'm not sure one cement truck
is gonna stop him for long.

06:41.093 --> 06:43.765
Sometimes an earthquake
is just an earthquake...

06:43.849 --> 06:44.976
especially here.

06:45.059 --> 06:47.857
And sometimes it's an evil PRIDE
plot to frack LA into the ocean.

06:47.940 --> 06:49.777
NICO: We have to make sure
the dig site's destroyed.

06:49.861 --> 06:51.990
Permanently this time.

06:52.073 --> 06:54.662
We need to power up,
which means I need the staff.

06:54.746 --> 06:56.791
You realize your mom has it, right?

06:56.875 --> 06:58.419
I mean, why don't we start off
by stealing something easy

06:58.503 --> 07:00.298
like the Elder Scrolls in Skyrim?

07:02.177 --> 07:03.179
Obviously a joke.

07:03.262 --> 07:04.640
Everyone knows how
hard those are to steal.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.561
No. Everyone does not know that.

07:06.644 --> 07:08.857
It's risky... going back
into the belly of the beast.

07:08.940 --> 07:10.778
-What if you get caught?
-Yeah, or worse.

07:10.861 --> 07:14.159
-That's why I'm going with her.
-Me, too.

07:14.242 --> 07:15.537
CHASE: I'm not much good
without the Fistigons,

07:15.621 --> 07:17.666
and I can't fix those
until I steal some power

07:17.750 --> 07:19.127
and get this place
back on the grid.

07:19.211 --> 07:20.923
I'll stay, too.

07:21.006 --> 07:23.762
I need to make sure this place
isn't a structural death trap now.

07:23.845 --> 07:25.181
I gotta get to my job.

07:26.559 --> 07:28.395
What?

07:28.479 --> 07:31.068
You never said you had a job.
What are you talking about?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.698
-I never said I didn't have a job.
-CHASE: You know what, Wilder?

07:34.324 --> 07:36.286
I'm sick of this secretive shit.
What job?

07:36.370 --> 07:37.581
Yeah. He's right. You gotta tell us.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.167
Shocking that you agree with Chase.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.923
Wow. Thanks for that refreshing dose
of patriarchal thinking,

07:42.006 --> 07:43.300
'cause I just-- I can't have have
an opinion of my own?

07:43.384 --> 07:44.386
Oh, boy. Now you've done it.

07:44.469 --> 07:45.471
You know what? I'm leaving.

07:45.556 --> 07:47.601
No, you're not.
Not until you tell us where.

07:47.685 --> 07:48.812
What are you gonna, Chase?
Beat it out of me?

07:48.895 --> 07:49.939
Oh, don't you think I couldn't.

07:50.022 --> 07:52.360
-[all arguing]
-Everyone, stop!

07:54.072 --> 07:56.034
Alex, you have to tell us.

07:56.786 --> 08:00.209
Our parents lied to us
every day of our lives.

08:00.293 --> 08:02.798
If we're gonna be different,
we gotta trust each other,

08:02.882 --> 08:04.760
and that means
no more secrets.

08:04.844 --> 08:06.973
Otherwise, we're just like them.

08:09.562 --> 08:10.898
Fine. I'm working for Darius.

08:12.233 --> 08:14.446
The guy who kidnapped
and almost shot you?

08:14.530 --> 08:16.450
[laughs] That's a great plan.

08:16.534 --> 08:18.454
Good thing you don't need
an IQ test to stay here.

08:18.538 --> 08:19.916
Yeah, 'cause then
where would you stay?

08:19.999 --> 08:22.838
Look, you guys asked me to tell you,
and I did, so now I'm leaving.

08:24.174 --> 08:25.552
Alex.

08:26.053 --> 08:27.430
At least he told us the truth.

08:34.068 --> 08:35.572
DALE:
This is the beginning of the end.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.993
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

08:38.077 --> 08:42.126
Uh, sorry. Jumping is the least
we can do. How about fleeing?

08:43.254 --> 08:46.553
Gene and Alice predicted earthquakes
followed by mass destruction.

08:46.636 --> 08:48.807
-I'm not seeing the mass destruction.
-Not yet.

08:48.890 --> 08:51.688
Leslie, has Jonah
said anything to you?

08:51.771 --> 08:53.984
No. These days he
only has eyes for Frank.

08:54.067 --> 08:56.990
TINA: Victor would know how
to keep the drill offline.

08:57.073 --> 08:59.494
Have you heard when Jonah's
planning on bringing him back?

08:59.579 --> 09:00.664
Or even if he is?

09:00.747 --> 09:03.335
Please. I'm always the last
to know anything.

09:03.419 --> 09:05.214
Is this meeting over? I need to go.

09:05.924 --> 09:07.761
What? I'm allowed to have plans.

09:10.517 --> 09:11.728
Well, us, too.

09:11.811 --> 09:13.815
But someone has to stay

09:13.898 --> 09:15.944
to monitor
the Wizey surveillance feeds.

09:16.028 --> 09:18.867
In case anyone still wants
to find our kids?

09:19.409 --> 09:21.288
Fine. We'll do it.

09:22.583 --> 09:25.547
You see anything,
you call me immediately.

09:25.631 --> 09:26.716
Got it?

09:30.682 --> 09:32.226
How's that co-chair thing
workin' out?

09:33.813 --> 09:35.859
[indistinct chatter]

09:41.871 --> 09:43.248
JONAH:
You brought what I asked?

09:49.929 --> 09:51.264
The plans are all here.

09:53.561 --> 09:54.980
And you're sure it's
everything Victor's got?

09:55.064 --> 09:58.445
Believe it or not, I can actually
read these specs too.

09:58.530 --> 10:01.118
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.372
Everybody knows you met Victor
in grad school,

10:03.455 --> 10:06.169
but they forget that you
were an excellent student as well.

10:06.253 --> 10:11.096
Your knowledge on gravitational
wave theory is quite impressive.

10:11.179 --> 10:13.560
It's been a while
since anyone's given me credit

10:13.643 --> 10:15.731
for more than just...

10:15.814 --> 10:18.737
bringing the best gluten-free banana
nut muffins to the bake sale.

10:20.030 --> 10:23.997
Well, I know how valuable
you are to PRIDE.

10:32.681 --> 10:34.727
How do I know Victor's
even still alive?

10:38.860 --> 10:40.697
How are you doing this?

10:40.781 --> 10:43.494
JONAH: I can't explain to you
how I'm using quantum field theory

10:43.578 --> 10:45.624
and sub-cellular
biophysical processes

10:45.707 --> 10:47.376
to keep your husband alive.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.297
You just have to trust
that I am. OK?

10:56.061 --> 10:59.025
He looks... peaceful.

10:59.108 --> 11:01.238
JONAH:
[scoffs] You have no idea.

11:01.321 --> 11:02.699
I'm glad.

11:04.578 --> 11:06.874
That's kind of surprising,
since you're the one who shot him.

11:09.045 --> 11:10.464
Getting a healthy Victor back

11:10.549 --> 11:13.387
is my best chance
at getting Chase home.

11:13.470 --> 11:15.266
Ah. [chuckles]

11:15.349 --> 11:17.771
Now, about those plans...

11:22.405 --> 11:23.700
You know...

11:25.912 --> 11:28.166
I'd be the perfect partner
to help you build this.

11:29.628 --> 11:32.801
I meant it when I said you
were impressive, relatively speaking,

11:32.885 --> 11:35.599
but Victor's already done
next generation work on this,

11:35.682 --> 11:38.980
and he and I are...

11:39.063 --> 11:41.109
in communication.

11:41.192 --> 11:42.696
The position's been filled.

11:42.779 --> 11:43.990
Thank you.

12:04.113 --> 12:05.617
You OK?

12:05.700 --> 12:08.080
Yeah, it's just...

12:08.790 --> 12:11.504
it already feels like a lifetime ago.

12:11.587 --> 12:12.923
Cool house. Looks deserted.

12:13.006 --> 12:14.008
Do you want me to
rip off the front gate?

12:14.092 --> 12:15.804
No. Nope.

12:15.887 --> 12:16.889
Come around this way.

12:16.973 --> 12:17.975
The surveillance cameras start
at the driveway,

12:18.058 --> 12:20.062
but there's a blind spot.
We can override Wizey from there.

12:20.145 --> 12:23.402
You want to kill your mom's
smart house? How do we do that?

12:24.404 --> 12:26.241
Not we. You.

nerve center inside.

12:44.235 --> 12:46.114
You think my powers
can somehow shut it off?

12:46.197 --> 12:47.659
Light is energy, right?

12:47.743 --> 12:50.205
Yeah. I've just never tried
anything like this before.

13:09.327 --> 13:10.496
Oh, my God, you're doing it!

13:10.580 --> 13:12.166
-I don't know what I'm doing.
-Just don't stop.

13:36.131 --> 13:37.551
hits Los Angeles.
Officials at--

13:39.178 --> 13:40.849
All right. We gotta move, OK?

13:40.932 --> 13:43.521
OK. I'll stand guard out here
just in case your mom shows.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.747
Should we grab anything else
while we're here?

13:56.547 --> 13:57.716
There's only one thing I want.

14:19.175 --> 14:21.346
-[monitor beeps]
-CATHERINE: Look. There.

14:21.429 --> 14:24.393
-The kids?
-White boy breaking into a car.

14:25.897 --> 14:27.901
GEOFFREY:
But it's not Chase.

14:30.489 --> 14:31.700
[Catherine sighs]

14:33.829 --> 14:36.000
GEOFFREY:
We're wasting our time.

14:36.084 --> 14:39.131
Agreed. Plus, everybody knows
if you don't solve a crime

14:39.215 --> 14:41.344
in the first 48 hours,
you probably don't solve it.

14:41.427 --> 14:43.264
-Meaning?
-It's time for a new tactic.

14:44.475 --> 14:48.066
We clear the kids in Destiny's murder.
Cancel the ABP.

14:48.149 --> 14:50.738
Then maybe they come up for air,
and we're ready to pounce.

14:50.822 --> 14:54.453
If there's anyone that can manipulate
the legal system to their advantage,

14:54.538 --> 14:55.707
it's you.

14:55.790 --> 14:58.253
Well, now you're
just sweet-talkin' me.

14:59.463 --> 15:02.094
I'll sit down with Flores,
see what I can do.

15:05.768 --> 15:07.605
I hate that our boy's out there.

15:09.483 --> 15:11.195
Me, too, baby...

15:14.035 --> 15:15.788
...but we're gonna find him.

15:23.178 --> 15:25.057
[phone ringing]

15:27.352 --> 15:29.023
GEOFFREY:
The hell does she want?

15:31.069 --> 15:32.530
[knocking on door]

15:40.295 --> 15:42.049
[clicks tongue]

15:42.132 --> 15:44.554
The hell you doin'
just showin' up here like this?

15:44.638 --> 15:45.848
You here 'cause you
want somethin'?

15:45.932 --> 15:47.977
Uh, sorry. No.
I thought I could

15:48.061 --> 15:49.396
help you guys out
with your moving.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.985
Yeah? You just thought,
"Hey, I guess I'll take the day off

15:52.069 --> 15:54.156
from bein' homeless so I can help
Darius move into his new crib."

15:54.240 --> 15:55.408
I mean, when you say it like that,

15:55.492 --> 15:58.123
it sounds like
I have an ulterior motive, but...

16:01.922 --> 16:04.218
Oh, that motive right there?
Not gonna happen.

16:04.301 --> 16:07.141
What? No, no. I was, um...
I was actually wondering

16:07.224 --> 16:09.019
about that old computer
that you have in your garage.

16:09.103 --> 16:11.650
Mm-hmm. Why?
Is it worth something?

16:11.733 --> 16:13.361
Not really.
I just wanted it for parts.

16:14.948 --> 16:17.787
Then knock yourself out.
First...

16:17.871 --> 16:19.498
you're gonna help me
with these record crates.

16:19.583 --> 16:22.087
Tam's a hoarder with this vinyl shit.
It weighs a ton.

16:22.171 --> 16:23.841
Tried to get her a Wizard phone
so she could--

16:23.924 --> 16:27.557
Now, D., you know there is
no school like old school.

16:27.640 --> 16:28.893
Uh-huh.

16:29.895 --> 16:31.314
I ain't paying you for this.

16:31.397 --> 16:33.234
-This shit is voluntary.
-Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

16:34.571 --> 16:35.656
Come in, bruh.

16:37.451 --> 16:39.205
Hey, grab a box first.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.419
That is sick.

17:05.508 --> 17:06.885
You're not gonna believe
what I just found.

17:07.887 --> 17:11.477
Is it a fully furnished home
with running water and electricity?

17:11.560 --> 17:13.732
-It's a car.
-A car that runs?

17:13.816 --> 17:14.858
Uh, not yet.

17:14.943 --> 17:17.824
With everything going on right now,
how is some junker--

17:17.906 --> 17:19.743
[scoffs] It's a Rolls.

17:19.828 --> 17:22.709
OK. I don't see how a large,
expensive junker is gonna

17:22.791 --> 17:23.919
improve the quality of our lives.

17:24.002 --> 17:25.881
You know what would actually help
is if you got the power on,

17:25.964 --> 17:27.384
like you said you would
three hours ago.

17:27.969 --> 17:30.098
Can you do that or not?

17:30.181 --> 17:32.729
Yeah. Yeah, um...

17:32.812 --> 17:35.025
the interior electrical system is intact,

17:35.108 --> 17:38.699
so it just needs a little Stein magic
to connect to the power grid.

17:39.951 --> 17:41.454
Great. Please go be magical.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.753
Gert.

17:46.882 --> 17:48.384
What's this about?

17:49.929 --> 17:51.725
Is it your meds?

17:51.808 --> 17:53.979
Not everything is
a pharmaceutical problem.

17:54.063 --> 17:56.400
If you haven't noticed,
our lives have fallen apart,

17:56.484 --> 17:58.822
and our new house...

17:58.906 --> 18:01.118
is challenging, to say the least.

18:01.703 --> 18:04.793
It's--It's messy,
and it's--it's confusing and I--

18:04.876 --> 18:07.297
I don't know what belongs to who,
or where anything goes--

18:08.257 --> 18:11.430
Are you talking
about this house...

18:11.515 --> 18:12.684
or us?

18:14.353 --> 18:17.902
I mean...our relationship.

18:18.696 --> 18:21.075
Yeah. I got what you
meant by "us," thanks.

18:23.329 --> 18:25.751
What, um--
What do--What do you mean?

18:27.922 --> 18:29.509
The night of the dance,

18:29.592 --> 18:31.972
we thought the world
was gonna end,

18:32.055 --> 18:34.435
but the world is still going.

18:34.519 --> 18:36.355
Well, at least for now.

18:36.439 --> 18:39.194
And we've been sharing
a sleeping bag--

18:39.278 --> 18:41.742
F-F-For warmth-- and...

18:41.825 --> 18:43.746
'cause supplies are limited.

18:43.829 --> 18:47.210
OK. But now we're here...

18:48.254 --> 18:51.553
and yeah, it's not perfect, but...

18:53.389 --> 18:54.601
it's a home.

18:56.020 --> 18:59.067
And it makes sense
that you'd be wondering...

18:59.151 --> 19:01.071
where that leaves you and me.

19:04.161 --> 19:05.790
That was shockingly insightful.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.962
[both chuckle awkwardly]

19:16.770 --> 19:18.774
Watch out for splinters.

19:20.986 --> 19:22.239
I'm good.

19:25.078 --> 19:26.372
Hey.

19:27.207 --> 19:30.798
We can do this
however you want.

19:33.344 --> 19:36.977
So you're saying
you do want to do... this?

19:39.524 --> 19:41.695
The two of us are a thing?

19:41.778 --> 19:43.155
That is what I'm saying.

19:44.742 --> 19:46.830
You know,
for someone so smart, you're...

19:46.913 --> 19:48.082
[both laugh]

19:51.590 --> 19:53.927
You-- You--

19:54.011 --> 19:57.017
You weren't wrong about...

19:57.100 --> 19:58.227
the medication.

20:01.275 --> 20:05.033
Just--Just not having them
makes everything a lot harder...

20:06.870 --> 20:10.628
like, um, including stuff that...

20:10.711 --> 20:12.715
makes me feel...

20:12.798 --> 20:14.761
nervous or vulnerable.

20:15.721 --> 20:18.142
Like...sex.

20:22.484 --> 20:25.783
Well...who's thinkin' about sex?

20:26.952 --> 20:28.872
I got the house to power up.

20:29.707 --> 20:31.043
[Gert chuckles]

20:33.339 --> 20:34.676
Hey.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.121
Maybe I'll come help you.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.335
NICO:
The staff isn't here.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.590
Change of plans.
We need to leave, like, now.

20:54.674 --> 20:57.137
No. She might've hid it in the house.
I know where to search.

20:57.220 --> 20:58.724
No. Your parents
are already on their way.

20:58.807 --> 21:00.811
-NICO: There's still time.
-No, there's not.

21:02.898 --> 21:04.192
[speaking Japanese]
Welcome home, Nico.

21:08.952 --> 21:10.329
Stay back.

21:10.413 --> 21:13.294
Hurting either of you
is the last thing I'd do. Nico!

21:19.891 --> 21:22.062
We've lost so much already.

21:23.064 --> 21:24.817
Please, just come home.

21:25.485 --> 21:26.654
It's too late for that.

21:26.738 --> 21:28.742
It's never too late to be a family.

21:31.038 --> 21:34.002
I'll find a way to make everything
OK again, I promise.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.883
Yeah.

21:36.966 --> 21:39.012
You know, when I was a little girl,

21:39.096 --> 21:42.352
hearing you say those words
made me feel so safe.

21:44.314 --> 21:46.820
-Now I know they're a lie.
-No, they're not--

21:46.903 --> 21:48.782
NICO: This family can't be
put back together again.

21:48.865 --> 21:53.040
-Nico--
-So... emotional good cop didn't work,

21:53.124 --> 21:55.211
and we all know what comes next.

21:55.294 --> 21:56.338
Let's just cut to the chase.

21:59.804 --> 22:00.806
Where is she?

22:18.508 --> 22:22.098
-I know this is what you came for.
-And I'm not leaving without it.

22:23.350 --> 22:25.229
MOLLY:
Thought I heard voices.

22:25.313 --> 22:27.150
Three against one.
I like those odds.

22:27.233 --> 22:29.739
TINA: This is between me
and my daughter.

22:29.822 --> 22:32.202
I haven't been your daughter
for a long time.

22:32.285 --> 22:35.626
Look, we can do this
the easy way or the hard way.

22:35.709 --> 22:37.170
Let's go hard.

22:40.969 --> 22:42.055
Aaah!

22:47.440 --> 22:48.860
[grunting]

23:06.729 --> 23:08.566
-[grunting]
-Stop this, Nico!

23:08.650 --> 23:09.777
[Nico roars]

23:11.572 --> 23:13.492
-Nico!
-Stay back!

23:16.373 --> 23:17.835
That's for Graciela.

23:24.890 --> 23:26.686
-MOLLY: Aah!
-Molly!

23:30.986 --> 23:33.616
-Freeze!
-[crackling]

23:33.700 --> 23:35.328
-No!
-Molly!

23:36.748 --> 23:38.042
[muffled shouting]

23:44.387 --> 23:45.766
-[muffled shouting]
-[punching ice]

23:46.768 --> 23:48.187
KAROLINA:
I'm coming for you, Molly!

23:49.272 --> 23:50.567
[Molly whimpering]

23:56.871 --> 23:57.956
NICO: Karolina!

23:58.040 --> 24:00.504
-Tina, no. Don't do this!
- Stop! Mom, please!

24:00.587 --> 24:04.219
This is why Amy's dead--
the monster you are right now!

24:05.639 --> 24:07.266
[panicky grunting]

24:14.239 --> 24:17.036
[gasping, coughing]

24:21.879 --> 24:23.048
[grunts]

24:23.800 --> 24:25.177
You don't know, Nico.

24:25.261 --> 24:28.518
I know... that you love
that staff's power

24:28.601 --> 24:30.020
more than you love any of us.

24:30.104 --> 24:32.901
I don't expect you to understand
the things I've done...

24:33.903 --> 24:35.740
or the reasons
that I have done them,

24:35.824 --> 24:38.078
but do not ever question
whether I love you.

24:41.794 --> 24:44.257
Take it. It's not a trick.

24:56.072 --> 24:58.494
You can go. All of you.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.632
But if you do, I want to be clear.

25:06.594 --> 25:09.390
When you leave here,
what you said before will be true.

25:09.474 --> 25:10.685
When we see each other again,

25:10.769 --> 25:12.355
we will no longer
be mother and daughter.

25:12.438 --> 25:15.069
-Tina.
-TINA: It's your choice.

25:15.152 --> 25:19.202
Stay and work this out...
or leave forever.

25:25.005 --> 25:26.091
Let's go.

25:34.274 --> 25:36.111
How could you, Tina?

25:37.363 --> 25:39.535
I didn't think she would take it.

25:48.928 --> 25:51.182
We know what you did
with the staff...

25:53.103 --> 25:54.230
what it did to you.

25:57.111 --> 26:00.994
Wonder what happens with it
in the hands of a volatile 16-year-old.

26:10.889 --> 26:11.891
You should hide it.

26:11.974 --> 26:14.103
It might draw
unwanted attention out here.

26:14.187 --> 26:15.397
NICO:
Yeah. We better hurry up.

26:15.481 --> 26:16.609
I'm zonked, guys.

26:16.692 --> 26:18.070
Just need to sit for a second.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.300
Wait. You're not wearing your bracelet.

26:30.804 --> 26:32.516
And you're not glowing.

26:32.599 --> 26:35.605
Yeah, I don't need it anymore.
I can power up and down without it.

26:36.231 --> 26:38.026
Wow. That's impressive.

26:39.613 --> 26:42.201
Too bad you didn't show that level
of talent just now with my mom.

26:45.583 --> 26:47.713
Wait, are you blaming me
for what happened back there?

26:47.796 --> 26:48.881
No. I'm just saying,

26:48.965 --> 26:50.552
you can't turn your back on a threat.

26:50.635 --> 26:52.848
-I did that to save Molly.
-But you didn't.

26:52.931 --> 26:55.979
-I got my mom to drop the spell.
-Oh, if you're gonna be pissed,

26:56.062 --> 26:57.858
be pissed at your
homicidal maniac of a mother.

26:57.941 --> 27:00.070
All I ever did was everything
that you asked,

27:00.154 --> 27:01.824
-and I had your back.
-OK, I'm just saying,

27:01.907 --> 27:02.993
we all need to do better--

27:03.076 --> 27:04.788
train harder,
learn how to fight as a team--

27:04.872 --> 27:06.834
No, that wasn't
what you were saying.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.462
And by the way, it wouldn't
make a difference anyway.

27:08.546 --> 27:09.715
We could train for months.

27:10.717 --> 27:13.681
We are not superheroes, OK?
We aren't good at this.

27:15.309 --> 27:16.520
I'm sorry I let you down.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.511
Not sure what you want with this.

27:32.594 --> 27:34.013
It's written in code.

27:35.098 --> 27:36.560
Catherine can read it.

27:36.644 --> 27:39.273
She does the prayer
before the sacrifices.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.277
Jonah translated that.

27:41.361 --> 27:43.156
She memorized it.

27:43.240 --> 27:45.452
He just likes her
to hold the book.

27:46.496 --> 27:49.210
The Abstract is what he calls it.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.964
He translated something
for Victor once

27:51.047 --> 27:52.174
when he was designing the box.

27:52.258 --> 27:54.930
It was all about energy conversion.

27:55.013 --> 27:58.771
So you're thinking this is what,
some kind of Jonah encyclopedia?

27:58.854 --> 28:03.280
I'm not sure, but...
I'm trusting him to save Victor,

28:03.363 --> 28:07.496
and it turns out that...
we don't know who Jonah is

28:07.581 --> 28:09.918
or where he's from
or even what he is,

28:10.002 --> 28:13.133
and I think that it's time
that we all got a lot more curious.

28:14.511 --> 28:17.308
You're still not gonna be able
to read it without his help,

28:17.391 --> 28:19.730
which I'm guessing
he's not gonna give you.

28:21.190 --> 28:23.069
Let me worry about that.

28:37.849 --> 28:39.185
[Chase grunts]

28:39.268 --> 28:41.523
