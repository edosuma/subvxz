17:34.760 --> 17:39.280
Cheap? *Who you called* cheap? What perfume you *worn*? "Catch of the day"?

17:39.280 --> 17:46.980

No.

19:11.360 --> 19:19.000
I, ah.. I can only play G-rated movies. 
- Oh well, there's nothing wrong with G-rated movies, as long as there's lots of sex and violence.

19:19.000 --> 19:30.080
I'm, hey, listen Bob, I'm only can be in town for a couple of days and I can think about anyone who I'd rather squeeze in my agenda.

19:53.080 --> 20:00.400
Oh, Mr. Talbot, your sister was like a mother to me.

20:00.400 --> 20:06.500
She was a mother to me too, dear. Well, now that we've dispensed with the obligatory display of bereavement,

20:06.500 --> 20:09.580
you may begin the proceedings, Mr. Bigelow.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.260
It was Mrs. Talbot's wish, to have all of her relatives present to reading of the will.

20:14.280 --> 20:21.580
All of her relatives are present - me, myself, and I.

20:21.600 --> 20:27.980
Apparently Ms. Talbot had a grand-niece, Elvira, who is also one of the beneficiaries.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.280
That is impossible.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.660
- Well. 
- Who is this grand-niece?

20:33.680 --> 20:38.000
Hey guys! Sorry I'm late, but then, so is my aunt.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.600
Hey, what she dies *for?* Nothing serious, I hope.

20:40.600 --> 20:45.060
Say, nice jacket. Who shot the couch?

20:45.080 --> 20:49.980
There is a bathroom around here? I'm telling you the toilet over the "Cozy Cot" looks like somebody's science project.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.360
Who is this woman?

20:52.360 --> 20:56.260
This must be Ms Talbot's grand-niece.

20:56.280 --> 21:01.000
Elvira, this is your grand-aunt's brother, Vincent Talbot.

21:01.000 --> 21:08.260
She was my aunt, and you are her brother, you must be my Uncle Vinnie!

21:08.280 --> 21:14.000
- Get this woman off of me! 
- And you must be Aunty Em and Uncle Remus.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.980
Oh! There is no place like home! There is no place like home!

21:18.000 --> 21:20.880
Hurry up, Bigelow, lets get on with it!

21:20.880 --> 21:29.980
Yeah, really, lets get go on, otherwise somebody else dies.

21:30.000 --> 21:35.680
"This is the certified only last will and testament of the deceased Morgan Talbot."

21:35.680 --> 21:41.600
"To my housekeeper, Mrs. Morrissey, for years of loyalty and devotion, I leave my silver tea service

21:41.600 --> 21:47.140
and a cash allotment of $5,000."

21:47.160 --> 21:50.980
Hey, baby what's *you(your) *worrying* about? You ** out * like a ***bandits****

21:51.000 --> 21:57.660
"To Mr. Morrisey, my driver, I leave my automobile and a allotment of $5,000."

21:57.680 --> 22:03.500
Wow, *dude* 10 grand just for a **help** * old aunt ****

22:03.500 --> 22:07.600
Oh, I mean, dear sweet Aunt Morgana, so ***really very*** generous!

22:07.600 --> 22:12.660
What it says about me? What I get? What I get? What I get?

22:12.680 --> 22:21.460
- "To my grand-niece Elvira.."
- Come on, ** about me, Aunt Morgana, big bucks, big bucks!

22:21.480 --> 22:27.860
"I bequeath * my house, my beloved poodle, Algonquin and my precious book of recipes."

22:27.880 --> 22:31.860
That's it? A house, a dog and a book?

22:31.880 --> 22:34.680
Please, if you will allow me to finish.

22:34.680 --> 22:40.140
"And finally, to my dear brother, Vincent, I leave the rest of my estate and holdings,

22:40.160 --> 22:44.580
which *stare* is none."

22:44.600 --> 22:51.140
Where's the cash? Where is the furniture? Where is Bob Ubanks?

22:51.160 --> 22:54.340
He was not mention.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.300
I *don't** get it me *, boss. What's so important about a *damn* recipe book?

22:58.300 --> 23:04.680
That damn recipe book content more power than your **fi*vle** little mind can ever imagine.

23:04.680 --> 23:09.260
And it rightfully belongs to me. I must have that book.

23:09.280 --> 23:15.160
Great! *just*  I need a house. And a house in Falwell, *like* I need a padded bra.

23:15.160 --> 23:23.740
I can not live here. I would go crazy! I tell you!
- Crazy!

23:23.760 --> 23:27.580
- May I if you a ride?
- Fuzz off, creep, I'm not in the mood!

23:27.600 --> 23:31.140
Oh, it's you, Uncle Vinnie! 
- Yes!

23:31.160 --> 23:38.400
Uncle Vinnie.. I must apologize for my behavior in the office, it's just that your appearance was a bit of a shock to me.

23:38.400 --> 23:41.000
It's OK. My appearance is kind of a shock to everybody. 

23:41.000 --> 23:48.260
Yes, well, as you * may assumes, * my sister and I, well.. let's just say we had a differences.

23:48.280 --> 23:51.340
Yeah, I guess, you really got shafted.

23:51.360 --> 23:56.360
Look, I *tell you what, *uncle Vinnie, err.. I'll share my inheritance with you. You can have the dog.

23:56.360 --> 24:02.000
No! Thank you! But I would be interested in requiring that recipe book.

24:02.000 --> 24:05.200
You know, *for the* sentimental reasons. I be willing to pay you.

24:05.200 --> 24:06.680
Say, fifty dollars.

24:06.680 --> 24:10.860
Yeah! Sure! I'll do it for fifty buсks.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.880
Vinnie, you got yourself that cookbook.

24:12.880 --> 24:15.760
The lawyer guys take me over the house, so you can pick up it later.

24:15.760 --> 24:18.080
Fine. I'll see you there.

24:18.080 --> 24:22.860
Oh, don't forget to bring a cash.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.580
Drive!

24:24.580 --> 24:34.860
*If wanna those **barrels** should have *** Oh, we're here!

24:34.880 --> 24:38.860
Hey, this place ain't *have* bad! *But* you can get a *abound* for it.

24:38.880 --> 24:54.580
Yes, you could, but your house is over there.

24:54.600 --> 25:00.560
Oh, Mr. Talbot, I just wanted to thank you for that generous donation you make to the Morality Club.

25:00.560 --> 25:04.060
- You're quite welcome. 
- You know, as I always say, morality *are* cheap.

25:04.080 --> 25:09.880
And speaking of cheap, a little birdy told me that that Elvira, woman is a related to you.

25:09.880 --> 25:14.900
* Now, **Not any say**any of my business, but then, of course, everything, yes.

25:14.900 --> 25:17.660
Believe me, I'm so anxious to get rid of her as you are.

25:17.680 --> 25:22.000
Oh, good! You know, because someone like that comes to town, the next thing, you know,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.000
the're tiching sex education in the schools,

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
*and* passing out condoms to *kindergartens*. You remember when those ***..

25:28.000 --> 25:33.060
She won't to be with us very long.

25:33.080 --> 25:44.000
*Yeah, well I know, I need it somewere Chastity Pariah can do, well, I know.*

25:44.000 --> 25:49.740
Careful! Some of the boards to loose.

25:49.760 --> 25:55.000
- What a dump! 
- **/* I 'm not that say, but **/** a house needs a little something.

25:55.000 --> 26:01.740
Yeah! Like a wrecking ball.

26:01.760 --> 26:08.740
- I think Algonquin likes you. 
- **  **, go on, go takes * some in the little stretch.

26:08.760 --> 26:16.060
I can't stand a little dogs. Boy, if my aunt was not dead, I'll kill her.

26:16.080 --> 26:23.140
Sorry, Aunt Morgana, just kidding.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.680
Here is the rest of her inheritance.

26:25.680 --> 26:32.460
Your great aunt's recipe book.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.580
Oh, yeah, some inheritance. Well, at least I'm get'g 50 bucks for it.

26:37.600 --> 26:40.000
Say, how much you think I can get for this place?

26:40.000 --> 26:47.000
Well, if * not the house in *disrepair* it is in the prime location * I've don't you decay* you could get.. 70 thousand.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.360
- 70 grand? 
- Maybe more, if you were fixed up. Would you be interested in selling?

26:51.360 --> 27:01.460
*** Of course I'm interested!

27:01.480 --> 27:13.740
Now, what am I can to do with you?

27:13.760 --> 27:17.500
That's we like it, Algonquin?

27:17.500 --> 27:36.580
Algonquin, what a sissy name! *Let's see* will I call you? I know, Gonk. Hey, you like that?

27:36.600 --> 27:42.000
Yeah, hold your horses.

27:42.000 --> 27:46.760
Hi, Uncle Vinnie, you're here for the book, right? Come on in. Oh, can I make you cup of tea or something?

27:46.760 --> 27:50.400
- I wouldn't wanna produce to any trouble. 
- Good point.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.600
I can't stay very long, anyway.

27:52.600 --> 27:55.660
- Say, you don't wanna buy a house, would you? 
- I'm afraid not.

27:55.680 --> 27:58.000
- I'll sell *at* you really cheap. 
- No, thank you.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.260
Vinnie, they don't make houses like this anymore, I mean. Look at the details.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.000
Look, look at the craftsmanship!

28:05.000 --> 28:06.680
How would you pay for a house like this?

28:06.680 --> 28:11.360
Don't answer, because you not only get the house, if you act right now you also get this beautiful furniture.

28:11.360 --> 28:14.000
Now would you pay? I tell you it's a jewel box.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
It's a gem, love hatch for two.

28:16.000 --> 28:20.460
I'd bend over backwards *to* make a deal, I'd bend over forwards. *******

28:20.480 --> 28:23.660
No! Just the book!

OK. If you *wanna* get crab ******

28:33.480 --> 28:37.200

**- Hey, don't get you pennies not bunch.* Didn't it's walk away. You sure * will turn out.**

29:22.680 --> 29:25.000

- You really want me to answer that?

Oh, * you're saying me that.*

30:06.680 --> 30:11.580
- Crap. 
- What do you see? What do you see? 
- Wait a minute.

30:11.600 --> 30:18.140

35:46.300 --> 35:51.000

35:51.000 --> 35:53.980
one moment Sodom and Gomorrah, if you will.

35:54.000 --> 36:02.880
A slimy slithering succubus, a concubine, a street walker, a tramp, a slut, a cheap whore!

36:02.880 --> 36:08.680
She'll be nothing but a bad dream just as soon as she sells that property. An open house is already planned on tomorrow.

36:08.680 --> 36:13.800
But what if she decides not to sell? What if she decides to settle here?

36:13.800 --> 36:19.680
Well, if she is morally unfit, then we have every right to do anything we can to get her out of this town.

36:19.680 --> 36:21.900
Are we agree? 
- Absolutely.

36:21.900 --> 36:25.580
- Maybe we're not being entirely objective about she..

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:14.118
Excuse me, is this face taken?

01:06:14.138 --> 01:06:27.980
Come on, *, let's Boogie!

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:39.060
Move! Move!

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:50.600
That's an interesting dish. Where did you learn how to make it?

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.980
Oh, it's just a old family recipe.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.340
All right, I'll give you a five hundred dollars for the book.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:04.060
Well, I look like I just fell off a ***? The deal's off, uncle.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:17.580
You think you're pretty clever, don't you? Well, mark my words, I'll get you and your little dog, too.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.580
Help!

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:26.980
No! No! Oh, you again?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:34.660
You always wear the same dress? 
- No. Sometimes I like wear some low cut and sexy.

01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:40.140
Well, I guess in your business you're paid for advertise.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:45.480
*Come here,* Bob, let me show how a real woman does it!

01:07:45.480 --> 01:08:00.860
Excuse me!

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:05.100
You all saw it! He attacked me in broad daylight and he had his way with me!

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.760
Me?! I barely got away with my live. You could have worn out a mechanical bull.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:14.860
You not gonna get away with it, you sex adult maniac!

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.300
I demand that the council remove this pervert.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.600
I never laid a hand on those sheep, so help me.

01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:29.140
Calvin was the one who *was ** everybody with apple butter. I was just an innocent on-licker.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.979
Silence!

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.880
Don't you see?

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:39.740
You're playing right into her hands.

01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:43.500
It's Elvira who is responsible for all this.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.580
Of course, I should have known that she was that little harlot.

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:50.140
*Yeah, ride her * right out of town on a big fat rail.

01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.760
She might enjoy that too much.

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.660
There is a much more satisfactory solution.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.580
We can have her arrested. 
- Arrested, on what charges?

01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:08.100
It's so happens that there is a law on that book that dates back to the Salem trials,

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.000
it's specifically prohibit and I quote:

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:23.000
"Any town's person from practicing the ancient arts of spell casting, demonology, alchemy and conjuration."

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:34.000
The charge, my fellow council members, is witchcraft. 

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.279
- Let me out of here! Let me out of here! 
- Stop *screaming* there!

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:43.080
Hey, I've seen the People's Court. I'm entitled to one phone call and a strip search. 

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.100
Well, there is a pay phone right across the street. What's the matter? You forget where you put your broom?

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:55.060
Listen, fatso, if I had a broom, I know exactly where I put it.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.260
Oh, this is swell! I can just hear Manny now.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.880
"Hello, Vegas! We get slight crimp on the plans for the show. 'Course star was burnt at the stake."

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:10.560
Elvira, great news. I get to the best lawyer in the county. He'll be here first sing */sign* in the morning.

01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:16.960
Bob, in the morning? First sing */sign* in the morning I'll be able to fit in the ashtray. You gotta get me outta here!

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.480
But how?

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:23.000
The book! It's my only chance. Quick, went to the house and get it! 
- OK.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.000
- Ou, Bob, wait! 
- What?

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:30.060
I hid it under the floor board in the living room. 
- OK.

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.880
- *Bob!* 
- What?

01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:41.460
Hurry!

01:10:41.480 --> 01:10:55.580
Move!

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:02.140
Now!

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:15.140
What do you whining about? I know *I'm getting* barbecue.

01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:32.860
Sorry.

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:45.460
It's mine! The power is mine!

01:11:45.480 --> 01:11:58.600
Gonk, *which does not give you a panic attack!*

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:05.000
Wow! I *think I took * too much acid in the '60s.

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:15.060
***** Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:21.140
Elvira! Elvira! Elvira!

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.000
- Thank goodness, Padre! 
- I am here to save you, my child.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:30.260
At last, someone* to talk some sense to *these people.

01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:33.980
Lord, save this *raptured* creature's soul

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:48.740
even ** creamy white flesh will burn and ***

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:54.060
Well, isn't that convenient!

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:57.140
Thanks for trying, you guys!

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:13.280
Elvira!

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:24.980
Gonk, is that you, boy?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.680
Good work, Gonk!

01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.000
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.140
- Do you * smoke? 
- Guess we'll find out soon enough.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:51.660
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:55.980
Burn the witch!

01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:10.080
Oh, no! *You will believe* this! **I left the oven on! Be right back.**

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.000
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:17.980
- Any last words? 
- Just one: Help!

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:23.580
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:30.660
Hold it! Hold it now! Quiet. Quiet!

01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:35.860
And now, by the power vested in me by the sovereign state of Massachusetts,

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:45.460
I do hereby pronounce sentence on Elvira, the prisoner. Death by fire!

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:51.700
- Hold it, sheriff! What you're doing is wrong. 
- Patty!

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:56.000
It all catch faster, if you light it in several places.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.580
Patty, no!

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.860
We have *** this every year.

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:08.060
- Burn in hell, witch! 
- Patty!

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:19.580
Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn the witch!

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.880
Bye, kids! It *meant *swell!

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.980
Just send my ashes to Las Vegas!

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000
Let me through!

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:38.340
Elvira! 
- Bob!

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:51.340
- Hi, Bob. 
- Patty, you're not a very nice person! 

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:58.740
Gonk?

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:06.740
Remember, you carry the power with you.

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:24.718
The ring!

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:53.460
Are you alright?

01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:57.580
Look, the Lunar eclipse!

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:02.980
Remember? Your aunt's letter? When the moon falls under the Earth shadow..

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:17.460
- Yeah, so? 
- Vincent's got the book.

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:22.340
Elvira!

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:30.060
Elvira!

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:38.000
Oh, you tricky little devil!

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Vincent, remember us?

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.500
We are on your side.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:57.000
Swine!

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:05.980
Stay back!

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:17.980
Attack him, Gonk!

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:24.860
Don't make me use this!

01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:30.260
The amulet could not protect your mother and it won't save you!

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:38.140
Kaldozar ipsole.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:56.118
*Do you wanna play* rough thing? * Well, take this!

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.740
You can not escape me, daughter of Devana!

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:25.260
I shall destroy you as I did her!

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:34.260
You're looking for me?

01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.660
Did you think you could stop with your toys?

01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:56.638
No, but I think it would be worth a shot. Look!

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:32.860
Cosa! Terra! Obtan!

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:50.838
Sure, it easy for you to say.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:11.060
* That hurts!

01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:18.460
Now, baby.

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.500
We have a little unfinished business.

01:21:22.500 --> 01:21:27.000
Yeah, well, I think we could do business..

01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.940
Yeah, sure, I can do to you..

01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:34.000
Uh.. I'm cool, bro.. no, what it is.. What is that?..***

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:52.238
I'll show you what..

01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:20.460
I am a Master of The Dark!

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:38.438
I'll see you in hell *berth!*

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:25.638
And now, Elvira, you'll die!

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:59.438
Remember, you carry the power with you!

01:24:05.080 --> 01:24:09.740
So, what did the insurance(t) guy say?

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.980
My policy does not cover *ancient*/*accident* demons.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:18.140
Well at least you still got the ring.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:24.660
Yeah, but the only thing I *get* to do anymore is look cheap. 

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:31.460
Gosh, Elvira, I'm sorry. *I know you hate your heart some play in Las Vegas.*

01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:35.500
I'm just not the kind of girl whose dreams come true.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:41.000
I do better a nightmares.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:56.980
- I wish I ** something I can do. 
- Oh, do not worry about me, Bob, I'm like a fake fruit, *** easy.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:00.460
Hey, Bob, they comes to lynch *me.* Take it easy, take it easy, I'm living.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:07.340
We don't want you to go. This is our way of saying we were wrong about you and we're sorry.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.740
Elvira, you're the best thing that ever happened to our town.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:14.500
You touch a part of my son that, that nobody's ever touched before.

01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:16.680
How I wish..

01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:23.340
As long as you in Falwell, you will always have a free room at the "Cozy Cot."

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:33.460
- Wait, just a minute, Leslie! 
- Shut up, you old bag!

01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:42.060
- *Finally, I got it runnuing.* 
- Great! ** At least *now I have* a place to live.

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.260
But I still* have no way to *pay for it. 
- Do not worry, we *work out* something.

01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:57.060
Elvira, I'm sorry that I set you on fire and everything and..

01:25:57.060 --> 01:25:59.740
I hope there no heart fillings.

01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.080
Do not worry, she is bigger than that.

01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:05.460
Yeah, a lot bigger.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.980
Elvira, I've got some an important papers that you gonna have to sign.

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.860
