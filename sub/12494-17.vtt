WEBVTT

00:05.709 --> 00:06.917
What is this?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.959
- Ooh ooh! I know!
- Wait.

00:11.417 --> 00:12.750
I want Gabe to answer.

00:12.834 --> 00:13.917
Aw.

00:14.000 --> 00:14.917
Uh...

00:15.000 --> 00:16.250
It's a plate.

00:16.667 --> 00:17.917
Wrong.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.709
Whoa. That'll teach me to get cocky.

00:22.333 --> 00:23.542
It's a dirty plate,

00:23.625 --> 00:25.625
which you were supposed
to put in the dishwasher.

00:25.709 --> 00:27.500
Now come on! How easy is that?

00:27.583 --> 00:28.709
If it's so easy,

00:28.792 --> 00:30.083
why didn't you do it?

00:32.417 --> 00:33.709
Now the plate's all the way out here

00:33.792 --> 00:35.709
and that one's on you.

00:37.125 --> 00:38.125
You know what, mister?

00:38.208 --> 00:39.417
You just bought yourself a ticket

00:39.500 --> 00:40.709
to a weekend of yard work.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.166
Take care of the plate.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.583
He's really been on my case lately.

00:49.959 --> 00:51.375
I don't know what to do about it.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.792
Well...

00:52.875 --> 00:54.667
You could put that plate
in the dishwasher.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.458
Yeah, but then he wins.

00:57.667 --> 00:59.583
Brother man, you should do what I did.

00:59.667 --> 01:00.667
Get your own apartment.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.375
Dude, I’m 13.

01:03.458 --> 01:04.875
Well, then we're back to the plate.

01:05.667 --> 01:07.959
Oh, hey! I got an idea.

01:08.041 --> 01:09.750
How about I come stay
at your place this weekend?

01:09.834 --> 01:11.166
Oh, yeah, sure. Why not?

01:11.250 --> 01:12.583
Emmett's out of town. Should be fun.

01:12.709 --> 01:14.875
- Hey, can I bring Jake?
- Sure.

01:14.959 --> 01:16.667
All right, this is great.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.750
Since I’m not here,
I don't have to do yard work.

01:19.834 --> 01:21.250
And then guess who wins?

01:28.041 --> 01:28.792
I do.

01:28.875 --> 01:29.709
Yeah yeah-- No, I know.

01:29.792 --> 01:30.709
I was just--

01:30.792 --> 01:32.709
Got nervous after the whole plate thing.

Spencer, how are you
not understanding this?

02:31.917 --> 02:33.834
I just-- I just don't see
what the big deal is.

02:33.917 --> 02:36.458
Okay, okay.
Let me break this down one more time.

02:36.542 --> 02:39.834
So, I had just done my big performance
in drama class.

02:39.917 --> 02:42.834
And then, that horrible
Ashley walks up to me

02:42.917 --> 02:43.959
and she says,

02:44.041 --> 02:46.333
"Looks like you're really
having fun out there."

02:49.375 --> 02:51.250
I still don't see why that's so bad.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.875
She was totally insulting me!

02:56.792 --> 02:58.250
But... by saying you had fun?

02:58.375 --> 02:59.917
Yes, that's what you say

03:00.000 --> 03:01.583
when somebody's performance stinks.

03:02.208 --> 03:03.875
Everybody knows that.

03:05.583 --> 03:08.083
Teddy, it just seems like
you're making a big deal out of nothing.

03:09.583 --> 03:10.709
Oh yeah?

03:10.792 --> 03:12.000
Yeah?

03:12.083 --> 03:14.583
Well, it seems like you're making nothing

03:14.667 --> 03:16.375
out of a big deal!

03:20.083 --> 03:22.000
Yeah, that's what I meant to say.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.166
Okay.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.750
Who put all of Toby's stuffed animals

03:32.834 --> 03:33.750
on the porch?

03:33.834 --> 03:35.333
Gabe.

03:39.709 --> 03:40.959
Aw.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.333
She pinned her first crime on me.

03:45.417 --> 03:46.834
What am I gonna do about this?

03:46.917 --> 03:48.917
- About what?
- Charlie.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.959
She still doesn't like Toby.

03:51.041 --> 03:52.500
This has been going on for months.

03:52.583 --> 03:54.250
I thought she'd be over it by now.

03:54.417 --> 03:55.834
Mom, some things take time.

03:55.917 --> 03:59.041
I mean, I still don't like Charlie.

03:59.375 --> 04:00.917
Teddy doesn't like me.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
PJ doesn't like Teddy.

04:03.291 --> 04:04.625
It's what makes us a family.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.375
Gabe, I wanted this time to be different.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.792
After all, Toby is gonna be my last baby.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.291
Mm-hmm.

04:17.125 --> 04:19.125
I upbeat music )

04:21.750 --> 04:23.083
Come on in.

04:23.166 --> 04:24.500
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:24.959 --> 04:26.083
So.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.375
This is where you live, huh?

04:27.458 --> 04:28.333
Yep.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.250
Well, it's still beats doing yard work.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.667
Hey, Gabe's brother.

04:33.750 --> 04:35.375
- What's up?
- Hey.

04:35.458 --> 04:36.458
What happened to Jake?

04:36.542 --> 04:39.500
He was busy,
so I called a couple of other kids

04:39.583 --> 04:40.458
and, uh...

04:40.959 --> 04:42.250
They weren't able to make it either.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.458
So, here's Logan.

04:45.959 --> 04:47.333
I’m often the last choice.

04:56.500 --> 04:57.917
Charlie,

04:58.000 --> 04:59.792
I bought you a present.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.333
Mm!

05:02.417 --> 05:04.125
Isn't it cute?

05:04.208 --> 05:06.041
Ohh.

05:06.125 --> 05:07.208
Here you go.

05:08.500 --> 05:11.417
Now, the first thing we need to do

05:11.500 --> 05:13.125
is name him.

05:13.208 --> 05:15.333
Right now what's a really good name

05:15.417 --> 05:17.709
for a sweet little baby boy?

05:17.792 --> 05:18.917
Oh, well, there's...

05:19.000 --> 05:20.208
Joby,

05:20.291 --> 05:22.417
Or Kobe, or--

05:22.500 --> 05:23.417
Toby.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.625
Toby!

05:25.709 --> 05:26.667
That's a great idea.

05:27.709 --> 05:28.709
So now when mommy's

05:28.792 --> 05:30.709
taking care of her baby,

05:30.792 --> 05:32.583
you can take care of your baby.

05:34.583 --> 05:36.583
I’m going to pick up

05:36.667 --> 05:37.959
ay Toby And give him a hug.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.917
Hello, little man.

05:42.166 --> 05:43.667
Amy: Hello.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.083
Ooh, big hug. Yeah.

05:46.166 --> 05:48.667
And you're gonna give your Toby

05:48.750 --> 05:49.750
a big hug.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.959
Amy: Oh.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.208
Mommy shoots...

05:55.291 --> 05:56.458
She scores.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.125
Hey, Spence.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.250
Flowers, huh?

06:21.375 --> 06:23.792
Yeah. I really owe Teddy an apology.

06:23.875 --> 06:24.875
For what?

06:27.709 --> 06:28.792
I have no idea.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.875
Luckily for you, I do.

06:32.959 --> 06:34.542
You know what? Step into my office.

06:36.291 --> 06:37.208
Okay.

06:37.291 --> 06:38.417
Look.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.500
The reason she got mad at you

06:40.583 --> 06:43.959
is that you didn't
get upset about nothing.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.709
Yeah, but it was nothing, right?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.083
Well, of course it was nothing.

06:49.166 --> 06:50.291
Well, I mean you know that.

06:50.375 --> 06:52.208
- Yeah.
-Bob: I know that.

06:52.291 --> 06:54.875
We're talking about
the female of the species.

06:54.959 --> 06:56.083
Bob: Okay?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.542
A highly irrational creature.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.458
Fortunately for you,

07:02.542 --> 07:04.834
after 20 long years of marriage,

07:04.917 --> 07:06.125
I am kind of an expert.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.041
Okay. Look.

07:11.125 --> 07:12.834
The key

07:12.917 --> 07:15.750
is that you gotta let
Teddy think that you care

07:15.834 --> 07:19.542
about all this stuff
that's not worth caring about.

07:21.542 --> 07:22.834
Look,

07:22.917 --> 07:25.625
when they have an issue,
like-- like-- like Teddy did yesterday.

07:25.709 --> 07:26.667
Mm-hmm.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.625
You just don't react.

07:29.709 --> 07:31.834
You overreact.

07:33.625 --> 07:34.542
So how do I do that?

07:34.625 --> 07:35.625
I'll show you. Okay.

07:35.709 --> 07:37.542
- You know what, you be Teddy.
- Okay.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.500
- I'll be you. All right.
- Yeah.

07:39.583 --> 07:40.709
Get mad about something.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.375
Okay. Um.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.500
A girl at school didn't like my hair.

07:45.583 --> 07:46.875
What?

07:48.458 --> 07:51.667
How could someone not like your hair?

07:53.375 --> 07:55.000
You have the best hair ever.

07:55.083 --> 07:56.083
Well, hey, calm down.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.583
No, I can't! You know what?

07:57.667 --> 07:59.500
It just-- it just-- It just burns me

07:59.583 --> 08:02.875
because your hair is so awesome.

08:05.417 --> 08:06.375
How do you feel?

08:06.458 --> 08:08.166
Like you really care about my hair.

08:09.166 --> 08:10.500
And...

08:10.875 --> 08:12.166
I couldn't care less.

08:14.959 --> 08:17.959
Oh, Mr. Duncan. This is really good stuff.

08:18.041 --> 08:19.458
Isn't it?

08:19.542 --> 08:21.166
Hey, you know the beauty of this is

08:21.208 --> 08:23.834
it works every time.

08:24.667 --> 08:25.917
Except the next time.

08:30.959 --> 08:32.917
Okay, here comes a skateboarder.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.333
All right, wait for it.

08:34.417 --> 08:36.083
Wait for it.

08:36.709 --> 08:37.625
Now.

08:37.709 --> 08:39.542
Oh yes!

08:39.625 --> 08:41.917
Oh. Looking up. Looking up!

08:43.500 --> 08:44.834
Pizza's here.

08:44.917 --> 08:45.959
Hey, what are you guys doing?

08:46.041 --> 08:47.625
Dropping water balloons.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.125
Come on, it's your turn.

08:49.208 --> 08:51.375
Quick. There's two old ladies coming.
Come on.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.083
You guys cannot be
dropping water balloons.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.625
- Why not?
- Because I live here

08:56.709 --> 08:58.125
and I want to keep living here.

08:58.208 --> 09:00.500
And what is with the tent?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.000
It's a sleepover.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.583
You can't have a sleepover without a tent.

09:06.000 --> 09:07.166
All right, well.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.667
We'll take this.

09:08.750 --> 09:09.792
Hey, guys.

09:09.875 --> 09:11.166
That pizza's for all of us.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.166
Logan: Hey, let's make some
prank phone calls.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.667
Oh, come on.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.000
Prank phone calls?
You guys are 13 years old.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.542
Are you really--

09:20.625 --> 09:21.542
Oh, hang on.

09:24.583 --> 09:25.625
Hello?

09:26.959 --> 09:29.458
No my butt is not on fire. Who is this?

09:30.750 --> 09:31.834
Boys, quiet. I’m on the phone.

09:38.792 --> 09:40.458
Teddy, Spencer's here.

09:40.542 --> 09:41.667
Oh, thanks.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.709
Oh, no no. You didn't let me finish.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.375
Spencer's here talking with your father.

09:47.917 --> 09:48.625
About what?

09:48.709 --> 09:50.792
That's the interesting part.

09:52.208 --> 09:56.000
Yeah. I just overheard Dr. Bob,

09:56.083 --> 09:58.500
professor of womanology,

09:59.917 --> 10:01.834
explain to Spencer

10:01.917 --> 10:04.333
that the best way of handling us gals

10:04.417 --> 10:06.333
is to pretend to care about stuff

10:06.417 --> 10:09.208
that isn't worth caring about.

10:11.291 --> 10:13.917
Really? Well, if I know Spencer,

10:14.000 --> 10:15.583
he said that that was ridiculous.

10:15.667 --> 10:19.000
Well, you don't know Spencer.

10:20.083 --> 10:21.917
I believe his exact words were

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
"This is really good stuff, Mr. Duncan."

10:25.166 --> 10:27.166
Huh.

10:27.250 --> 10:30.667
Well, I think I need
to have a little chat with my fella.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.667
No, no, no, no.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.750
We do not handle these
things with communication.

10:36.041 --> 10:38.333
Come on, Teddy. We get revenge.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.750
First on Spencer...

10:41.834 --> 10:44.834
Then on Dr. Bob.

10:46.959 --> 10:49.667
Oh, I see Dr. Amy's in the house.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.250
Mm-hmm.

10:51.417 --> 10:52.750
And she's about to administer

10:52.834 --> 10:54.834
ten cc's of ba-bam.

11:02.709 --> 11:04.333
Both: Oh!

11:04.417 --> 11:06.250
Hey, guys? Volume.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.625
Oh, he's right.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.333
Let's crank it up.

11:09.375 --> 11:10.542
No.

11:10.625 --> 11:11.917
Turn it down.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.417
- What?
- Down.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.083
I can't hear myself think.

11:15.166 --> 11:17.375
No one's ever heard you think.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.000
You know what? That is it.

11:21.083 --> 11:22.417
I have had enough of you two.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.000
No more video games.

11:24.083 --> 11:25.792
- What?
- No more video games.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.250
I’m trying to study for a test.

11:27.375 --> 11:28.500
What are we supposed to do?

11:28.583 --> 11:30.583
I don't care, as long as it's quiet.

11:30.667 --> 11:33.458
Man, I thought you said
your brother was fun.

11:33.542 --> 11:34.792
He used to be.

11:35.166 --> 11:36.500
Before he turned into Dad.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.500
What did you just say, mister?

11:38.583 --> 11:40.792
Now you even sound like him.

11:40.875 --> 11:43.792
You know, I came over here
to get away from him,

11:43.875 --> 11:45.500
not to be with Dad Jr.

11:45.583 --> 11:47.667
I am not Dad Jr.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.166
And you just bought yourself a ticket

11:49.250 --> 11:50.375
to doing the dishes.

11:50.458 --> 11:51.750
We used paper plates.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.917
And I want them spotless.

11:58.625 --> 11:59.834
Mary Lou,

11:59.917 --> 12:01.625
I should be a child psychologist.

12:02.667 --> 12:03.625
Really.

12:03.709 --> 12:05.417
I gave Charlie a Toby doll

12:05.500 --> 12:06.333
and she loves it.

12:06.417 --> 12:07.834
And pretty soon she'll feel the same way

12:07.917 --> 12:09.375
about the real Toby.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.250
I’m telling you, It's brilliant.

12:11.333 --> 12:13.041
One day it will simply be known as

12:13.125 --> 12:15.709
"The Duncan method."

12:19.125 --> 12:20.625
Let me call you back.

12:29.709 --> 12:30.750
Charlie?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.500
Did you mistake the trash can

12:32.583 --> 12:34.125
for a magical doll house?

12:34.208 --> 12:35.542
No.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.417
I’m not two.

12:37.875 --> 12:39.792
Oh, Charlie.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.083
Why don't you love baby Toby?

12:42.166 --> 12:43.709
He loves you so much.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.000
How do you know?

12:45.083 --> 12:46.375
Because he told me.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.083
He can't talk.

12:50.667 --> 12:52.250
Or can he?

12:54.875 --> 12:56.250
What are you looking at?

13:01.959 --> 13:04.750
Yes-- no, I understand
that I lost the receipt,

13:04.834 --> 13:05.875
but I never wore them,

13:05.959 --> 13:08.667
so why can't I take them back?

13:08.750 --> 13:11.333
But that's a stupid policy!

13:14.375 --> 13:15.834
Nev-- never mind.

13:17.041 --> 13:18.208
What was that all about?

13:18.250 --> 13:19.834
I bought these running shoes,

13:19.917 --> 13:21.041
but they were in the wrong size

13:21.125 --> 13:23.333
and now the stupid store
won't let me return them.

13:23.417 --> 13:24.792
Oh, well. What are you gonna do?

13:30.417 --> 13:31.917
I'll tell you what I’m gonna do.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.500
I’m gonna get angry!

13:37.417 --> 13:39.917
How dare they treat you like that?

13:41.083 --> 13:41.917
What?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.208
I can't believe this.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.083
Who was the idiot you were dealing with?

13:46.291 --> 13:48.500
Uh, I think it was someone named Sam?

13:48.583 --> 13:50.875
Oh, Sam must have a brain
the size of a walnut.

13:52.583 --> 13:54.750
Spencer, honey. Just calm down.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.208
No, I can't calm down, all right?

13:56.291 --> 13:58.375
Because I am so furious with this Sam!

13:59.750 --> 14:01.959
I am disgusted by Sam.

14:02.041 --> 14:05.750
I am so glad you feel this way.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.333
I’m gonna get my keys.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.542
Wait.

14:13.250 --> 14:14.583
What are you getting your keys for?

14:14.959 --> 14:16.750
Because we are going down to that store

14:16.834 --> 14:17.750
and you're gonna give Sam

14:17.834 --> 14:19.834
a piece of my mind!

14:23.750 --> 14:25.291
What just happened?

14:26.750 --> 14:27.959
I don't know.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.917
We're in uncharted territory.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.250
What do I do now?

14:33.333 --> 14:34.458
I don't know.

14:34.542 --> 14:36.000
We're in uncharted territory.

14:42.709 --> 14:43.834
Amy: Psst.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.083
Hey, Charlie.

14:50.375 --> 14:51.625
Who said that?

14:51.709 --> 14:53.834
Amy: It's me, Toby.

14:54.875 --> 14:56.000
Come here.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.500
You can talk?

15:01.583 --> 15:03.709
Amy: Just to you.

15:04.417 --> 15:05.542
Charlie?

15:06.375 --> 15:09.208
You're my favorite in the whole family.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.375
Really?

15:10.458 --> 15:11.709
Amy: Yeah.

15:11.792 --> 15:14.208
I love you, Charlie.

15:14.291 --> 15:16.709
Do you love me too?

15:16.792 --> 15:18.667
Yes.

15:19.375 --> 15:20.750
That is so--

15:23.125 --> 15:24.458
Goody.

15:26.917 --> 15:28.542
Now remember,

15:28.625 --> 15:31.667
this is our very special secret.

15:32.458 --> 15:33.750
Just for us.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.458
Don't tell anyone.

15:36.000 --> 15:37.041
Amy: Okay?

15:37.417 --> 15:38.625
Okay.

15:42.959 --> 15:44.583
Hi, Charlie.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.041
Toby talks.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.250
You know, there's no reason
to cause a scene.

15:56.333 --> 15:58.125
I think we made our point
just by showing up.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.250
Yes, hi.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.917
Um, we'd like to speak to Sam.

16:01.000 --> 16:02.208
We have a problem.

16:02.709 --> 16:03.625
I’m Sam.

16:05.458 --> 16:06.834
What seems to be the problem?

16:07.959 --> 16:10.041
No problem.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
But you just said there was a problem.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.083
No, uh, no.

16:14.166 --> 16:15.166
She said it.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.375
Come on, Spencer.
Tell him what You told me.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.291
Gosh. Who can remember?

16:23.166 --> 16:25.959
He said you have a brain
the size of a walnut.

16:28.041 --> 16:28.959
Excuse me?

16:29.041 --> 16:30.291
Uh.

16:30.625 --> 16:33.000
To be fair, I've seen
some pretty large walnuts.

16:33.875 --> 16:34.959
And-- and

16:35.041 --> 16:37.792
he said that he was disgusted by you.

16:37.875 --> 16:40.417
But then I walked it back to just furious.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.125
Is there anything else
you'd like to say to me

16:44.959 --> 16:47.125
before I take you into the break room,

16:47.500 --> 16:49.250
where I will break you?

16:51.709 --> 16:52.625
Ah, wait.

16:52.709 --> 16:53.834
Uh, look.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.542
I didn't mean any of the things I said.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.834
See, I took some
bad advice from her father,

16:57.917 --> 17:00.917
and uh, I was really stupid.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.750
And I am very sorry.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.417
Please don't break me.

17:08.709 --> 17:09.625
Heard enough, Teddy?

17:09.709 --> 17:11.000
Thanks, Sam. I’m good.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.333
Cool.

17:12.417 --> 17:14.500
Hope I didn't scare you
too much, little guy.

17:17.834 --> 17:18.917
What just happened?

17:20.083 --> 17:21.625
Oh, what just happened was

17:21.709 --> 17:23.583
I, the woman,

17:23.667 --> 17:25.709
taught you, the idiot,

17:25.792 --> 17:26.750
a lesson.

17:28.458 --> 17:29.458
So you heard everything?

17:29.542 --> 17:30.792
My mom did.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.166
Oh.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.458
Look, I, I promise

17:33.542 --> 17:35.667
I'll never take advice
from your father again.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.709
Everyone gets there eventually.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.583
Oh, uh, thanks again, Sam.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.291
Hey, how do you guys now each other?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.959
Oh, he's in my community theater group.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.083
Great job.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.667
Thanks, Teddy.

17:49.750 --> 17:50.875
And you...

17:50.959 --> 17:52.750
really looked like
you were having fun out there.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.542
Well, that hurt.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.542
There she is.

18:09.291 --> 18:11.000
The woman I love.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.709
These are for you.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.417
Hmm. What's the occasion?

18:17.250 --> 18:18.709
There has to be an occasion?

18:20.917 --> 18:24.000
Can't a man give
the love of his life flowers just because?

18:25.583 --> 18:26.875
Heard about the shoe store?

18:26.959 --> 18:28.542
Yes, I did.

18:31.792 --> 18:33.291
Please accept the flowers.

18:36.583 --> 18:38.500
Hmm. No thanks.

18:39.792 --> 18:41.583
Oh, come on, honey.

18:41.667 --> 18:42.917
Honey.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
Come on.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.625
I don't really believe any of that stuff

18:46.709 --> 18:48.500
that I was telling Spencer.

18:48.583 --> 18:49.959
And you know what?

18:50.041 --> 18:51.250
Since Teddy taught him a lesson,

18:51.333 --> 18:54.250
I don't really need you
to teach me a lesson.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.959
You're afraid, aren't you, Bob?

19:01.750 --> 19:02.959
Uh-huh.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.375
Well, I accept your apology.

19:07.458 --> 19:08.875
So we're--

19:08.959 --> 19:09.959
We're good?

19:10.041 --> 19:12.959
Oh. I’m sorry, Bob.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.750
Things are already in motion.

19:14.834 --> 19:16.542
Things?

19:17.333 --> 19:18.625
Oh, come on.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.542
What kind of things?

19:22.125 --> 19:23.375
I wish I could help you,

19:23.458 --> 19:25.750
but it's out of my hands.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.000
Gabe: When did you turn into Dad?

19:36.083 --> 19:39.083
Into dad? Into dad?

19:39.166 --> 19:40.792
How come when
you hear things in your head

19:40.875 --> 19:42.000
They always have an echo?

19:42.083 --> 19:44.792
An echo? An echo?

19:44.875 --> 19:46.709
I am not turning into Dad.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.417
I just have a lot of responsibilities.

19:48.500 --> 19:51.667
School, a job, a future to worry about.

19:51.750 --> 19:54.250
Those kids have no idea how hard I work.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.834
Oh, man.

19:57.166 --> 19:58.875
I am turning into Dad.

20:00.583 --> 20:02.583
Hey, guys.

20:02.667 --> 20:05.375
Wake up.

20:05.458 --> 20:08.583
- Get up.
- Gabe: What?

20:08.709 --> 20:09.625
It's three in the morning.

20:09.709 --> 20:10.750
Get your shoes on.

20:10.834 --> 20:12.250
We are going for a little trip.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.834
I’m gonna show you guys
that I’m still fun,

20:14.917 --> 20:16.750
and childish

20:16.834 --> 20:18.458
and totally immature.

20:18.542 --> 20:19.542
He's back!

20:30.333 --> 20:31.417
What do you think?

20:33.333 --> 20:34.625
Now let's get Mom.

20:34.709 --> 20:35.834
Go.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.083
Wouldn't do that if I were you.

20:38.792 --> 20:40.000
Let's not get Mom.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.208
Hi, Mrs. Duncan.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.792
Get out of my bedroom, Logan.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.083
Oh, okay, honey.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.000
Well done.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.709
Lesson learned.

21:03.542 --> 21:04.583
What are you talking about?

21:05.375 --> 21:06.208
This.

21:06.250 --> 21:07.375
Isn't this your revenge?

21:07.458 --> 21:09.000
Drawing on your face?

21:09.750 --> 21:11.250
Does that sound like me, Teddy?

21:11.333 --> 21:12.792
It's doesn't, mom.

21:12.875 --> 21:13.875
Hmm.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.750
So there's more?

21:17.834 --> 21:20.500
More?

21:21.667 --> 21:23.667
It hasn't even started.

21:26.542 --> 21:27.542
Oh.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.834
Teddy, turn the camera on.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.250
Hey, Charlie.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.333
Well, uh, I wasn't really planning

21:36.375 --> 21:37.625
on doing a video diary right now,

21:37.709 --> 21:39.625
but Mom told me to turn the camera on,

21:39.709 --> 21:41.542
So something is up.

21:41.625 --> 21:42.834
Bob: Ooh, donuts!

21:53.417 --> 21:55.625
Bob: Exploding donuts.

21:55.709 --> 21:56.834
That's--

21:56.917 --> 21:58.125
Lesson learned.

21:59.208 --> 22:00.709
Okay, are we done now?

22:00.792 --> 22:01.917
Oh.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.250
Yes.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.583
With phase one.

22:07.583 --> 22:09.458
Oh, man.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.875
Wish me good luck, Charlie.

22:19.750 --> 22:20.834
Okay, PJ.

22:21.041 --> 22:22.750
Now I know you've been
resenting your sister

22:22.834 --> 22:24.250
for some time now.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.667
And so I bought you something to help you

22:26.750 --> 22:28.458
finally get over it.

22:28.542 --> 22:29.750
Open your eyes.

22:31.166 --> 22:32.166
What is it?

22:32.250 --> 22:33.583
It's a Teddy doll.

22:33.667 --> 22:34.834
Go ahead. Pull the string.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.375
You're the best big brother ever.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.750
Aww.

22:40.834 --> 22:42.625
This is so sweet.

22:44.041 --> 22:46.917
I’m so glad you moved out.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.250
That wasn't quite as nice.

22:53.750 --> 22:56.875
I never really liked you.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.333
I’m made of plastic

22:58.375 --> 23:00.625
and I’m still smarter than you.

23:02.709 --> 23:03.709
This is the worst gift ever.

23:06.125 --> 23:07.792
Okay, that's it.
You're going back to the store.

23:07.875 --> 23:08.792
You're beautiful.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.792
Are you an actress?

23:12.500 --> 23:13.875
Okay, I’m gonna give you one more shot.
