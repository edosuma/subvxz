00:00.437 --> 00:04.141
<i>It was the Fall of 2009
and I was a professor now.</i>

00:04.094 --> 00:06.296
<i>So I decided to change my look
a little bit.</i>

00:06.364 --> 00:08.398
<i>And people were noticing.</i>

00:08.466 --> 00:10.650
Ah, tweed.

00:10.718 --> 00:12.202
Textile of the eunuch.

00:12.269 --> 00:13.520
You know, I've always

00:13.604 --> 00:15.955
Wondered why those tweed jackets
have elbow patches.

00:15.990 --> 00:17.907
Because the people who wear
them are constantly going,

00:17.908 --> 00:20.908
"Aw, geez, why can't I get laid?"

00:22.012 --> 00:22.979
You are wrong. Get laid?

00:23.030 --> 00:24.931
The ladies dig
the professor look.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.499
You know, there is
something to that.

00:26.584 --> 00:28.618
I remember thinking my tenth grade
math teacher

00:28.669 --> 00:30.787
Was very sexy.

00:30.855 --> 00:32.822
I wonder if Harold's
still in jail.

00:32.890 --> 00:34.541
What?

00:34.608 --> 00:37.210
Tax evasion.

00:37.294 --> 00:38.628
Among other things.

00:38.696 --> 00:41.330
So guys, Marshall

00:41.382 --> 00:43.266
And I wanted to invite
you to our place

00:43.333 --> 00:45.034
For a little couples' night.

00:45.102 --> 00:47.353
Uh, sure. Why not?

00:47.438 --> 00:50.023
<i>For years, Marshall and Lily
had been the only</i>

00:50.091 --> 00:52.559
<i>Married couple in a group full
of single people.</i>

00:52.626 --> 00:53.726
<i>It got lonely.</i>

00:53.811 --> 00:54.978
<i>So they were always</i>

00:55.045 --> 00:56.396
<i>Searching
for another couple</i>

00:56.480 --> 00:57.513
<i>To double-date.</i>

00:57.565 --> 00:59.065
<i>There was only one problem.</i>

00:59.133 --> 01:01.351
Welcome.
Gouda?

01:01.419 --> 01:03.520
<i>They sucked at it.</i>

01:03.587 --> 01:05.321
This is great.

01:05.388 --> 01:07.440
We're having fun.
You're having fun, right?

01:08.476 --> 01:10.009
So, should we
just go ahead

01:10.044 --> 01:12.078
And lock the four of
us in for new year's?

01:12.146 --> 01:14.597
Um, it's April.

01:14.665 --> 01:16.866
Right. Sorry.

01:16.917 --> 01:18.084
We're getting
ahead of ourselves.

01:18.169 --> 01:19.419
Let's talk Thanksgiving.

01:19.503 --> 01:22.589
Our parents really
want to meet you!

01:26.644 --> 01:29.446
Well, we should
probably be going.

01:29.513 --> 01:30.980
Wait. But, wait,
if you leave now,

01:31.048 --> 01:32.682
Colonel mustard
just gets away with it.

01:32.750 --> 01:34.884
It's getting pretty late.
We're going to go.

01:34.935 --> 01:36.219
There's still pie.

01:38.939 --> 01:41.608
Tonight was fantastic.
We should do it again.

01:41.675 --> 01:44.844
I'm sorry, Marshall,
but Falguni and I

01:44.912 --> 01:46.613
are just not that into you.

01:46.697 --> 01:49.048
And you.

01:49.116 --> 01:51.701
<i>But just when Lily and Marshall
were about to give up,</i>

01:51.769 --> 01:54.120
<i>Two of their best friends
in the world got together.</i>

01:54.121 --> 01:56.289
<i>And hope returned
to their hearts.</i>

01:56.406 --> 01:57.907
Wohoo!

01:57.958 --> 01:59.926
<i>So when Lily said...</i>

02:00.010 --> 02:02.462
Marshall and I wanted
to invite you to our place

02:02.546 --> 02:04.230
For a little couples' night.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.616
Um, sure, why not?

02:06.684 --> 02:08.518
<i>.Barney and Robin had no idea</i>

02:08.619 --> 02:09.985
<i>What they were
about to walk into.</i>

02:10.086 --> 02:11.387
Okay. Game time.

02:11.438 --> 02:13.223
Let's review
the flow of the room.

02:13.290 --> 02:15.642
Barney and Robin
enter here.

02:15.726 --> 02:17.227
Stop here for margaritas.

02:17.294 --> 02:18.862
That's a great
conversation starter.

02:18.929 --> 02:20.897
We can tell them about
our trip to Cabo.

02:20.965 --> 02:22.899
Great, 'cause I got that story
about Sammy Hagar

02:22.950 --> 02:24.901
Anthe Belgian waffle locked
and loaded.

02:24.969 --> 02:27.720
Then we'll move on
to the hot apps station.

02:27.788 --> 02:29.706
And, depending on how
things are going,

02:29.773 --> 02:32.258
Some lively pre-dinner charades.

02:32.326 --> 02:36.329
Right, but, uh,
we'll play that one by...

02:36.413 --> 02:37.680
Sounds like?

02:37.748 --> 02:39.799
Okay, you can be
Robin's partner.

02:41.252 --> 02:44.470
Oh... Baby, we can do this.

02:47.141 --> 02:49.142
Welcome.
Gouda?

02:50.678 --> 02:52.762
<i>Meanwhile,
my half-baked theory</i>

02:52.813 --> 02:54.147
<i>That ladies dig
the professor look</i>

02:54.231 --> 02:55.782
<i>Was actually
proving to be true</i>

02:55.849 --> 02:57.433
So is it hard
to grade papers?

02:57.501 --> 02:59.068
No, you've just got
to make it fun.

02:59.136 --> 03:01.988
For example, uh, every time
I spot a grammatical error,

03:02.072 --> 03:03.439
I do a shot.

03:03.490 --> 03:04.991
I'm trashed right now,
and I blame

03:05.075 --> 03:07.026
Our public school system.

03:07.111 --> 03:10.163
<i>Sometimes things just seem
to magically fall into place.</i>

03:10.247 --> 03:12.782
So, you said
you live right upstairs...

03:12.850 --> 03:14.867
<i>Whether it's
in the dating world...</i>

03:14.952 --> 03:16.536
Take care. Bye.
Bye!

03:16.620 --> 03:19.005
<i>...Or the double-dating world.</i>

03:19.089 --> 03:20.290
Nailed it!

03:20.357 --> 03:21.658
Best night ever!

03:23.193 --> 03:25.661
Worst night ever.

03:43.053 --> 03:45.354
Hey, how was the big couples'
night with Marshall and Lily?

03:45.405 --> 03:47.507
Brutal.
Really? How?

03:47.574 --> 03:49.558
It was like we were on a date

03:49.610 --> 03:51.861
With a sad, chubby girl
our mom made us call.

03:51.929 --> 03:53.529
And they were so nervous,

03:53.597 --> 03:55.748
That they weren't even making sense
half of the time.

03:55.816 --> 03:57.116
Hey.
Come on in.

03:57.117 --> 03:58.584
Would you
like a margarita?

03:58.669 --> 04:01.237
In Cabo, I saw Sammy Hagar eating
a Belgian waffle! Come on in.

04:03.190 --> 04:06.809
And they kept shoving platters
of food in our faces.

04:06.877 --> 04:08.410
Did Marshall get, like,

04:08.462 --> 04:10.096
Super intense about the cheese?

04:10.164 --> 04:11.681
Yeah, how'd you know?

04:11.748 --> 04:13.099
Poor Marshall.

04:13.183 --> 04:15.184
Lily's this gourmet cook,
and all she lets Marshall

04:15.252 --> 04:18.070
Is pick out one sad block of cheese.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.039
That's prosciutto-wrapped melon.

04:20.107 --> 04:22.391
You guys are going to want
to get in on this gouda.

04:22.459 --> 04:24.827
That's seared scallops
with a mango chutney.

04:24.895 --> 04:26.662
Seriously, don't sleep
on the gouda.

04:26.730 --> 04:27.797
And that's

04:27.865 --> 04:29.982
Lobster ravioli
in a black truffle oil.

04:30.067 --> 04:32.285
Ooh...
Tick-tock goes the gouda clock.

04:33.737 --> 04:36.289
Um, we-we-we didn't realize
there was gonna be dinner.

04:36.356 --> 04:38.674
We sucked down a couple
tacos outside the subway.

04:38.742 --> 04:41.377
P.S., not
sitting great.

04:42.796 --> 04:45.665
And if anything didn't go
according to plan,

04:45.749 --> 04:47.099
They would freak out.

04:47.134 --> 04:49.685
What do you mean,
the egg timer is broken?

04:49.753 --> 04:51.587
What are we going to use
for charades, sweetie?

04:51.655 --> 04:52.922
I'm working on it, darling.

04:52.973 --> 04:54.390
Okay? Just stall them.

04:54.424 --> 04:57.176
Now, Robin...

04:57.177 --> 04:58.477
You work in television.

04:58.512 --> 05:01.180
We're experiencing some
technical difficulties.

05:01.181 --> 05:02.265
You get that?

05:02.332 --> 05:04.150
We're still laughing.

05:04.234 --> 05:07.370
Right? Laugh, Marshall.

05:11.241 --> 05:13.109
Come on, they just
got excited.

05:13.160 --> 05:15.294
They've been looking for couple
best friends forever.

05:15.362 --> 05:17.313
<i>Plus, I'm sure
they weren't that bad.</i>

05:18.432 --> 05:19.448
Show him.

05:19.516 --> 05:21.617
This is a web site

05:21.685 --> 05:24.270
Marshall already made
about last night.

05:24.338 --> 05:28.341
It's called
itwasthebestnightever.com.

05:31.194 --> 05:34.430
* It was the best night ever *

05:34.497 --> 05:38.634
* laughter raining down
like April showers *

05:39.970 --> 05:42.972
* oh, we talked for hours... *

05:44.708 --> 05:48.160
* best night ever *
oh, that's not good.

05:48.228 --> 05:51.030
* Then we played charades *

05:51.114 --> 05:54.533
* Lily made some creme brulee,
lay-lay-lay-lay *

05:54.618 --> 05:57.903
* and now that
we're best couple friends *

05:57.988 --> 06:00.456
* there's only one thing *

06:00.523 --> 06:04.877
* left to say... *

06:04.962 --> 06:07.213
* are you free? Are you free?
Are you free? *

06:07.281 --> 06:10.333
* Are you free?
Are you free next Saturday? *

06:10.384 --> 06:12.535
That's the 17th.
* Are you free? *

06:12.603 --> 06:14.070
Friday or Sunday
would also work.

06:14.137 --> 06:16.822
Or basically any other day.

06:16.890 --> 06:19.875
Needless to say, we've both changed
our e-mail addresses.

06:19.926 --> 06:21.377
I don't understand.

06:21.428 --> 06:23.212
If last night went so horribly,

06:23.246 --> 06:25.531
Why do Lily and Marshall
think it was such a hit?

06:25.599 --> 06:27.500
I mean, we knew we were gonna have
fun tonight,

06:27.567 --> 06:29.602
But we had no idea how much.

06:29.670 --> 06:30.786
Oh.
Yeah, tough luck,

06:30.854 --> 06:32.438
Every Saturday
night I've ever had,

06:32.522 --> 06:34.757
'cause this one just
blew you out of the water.

06:34.825 --> 06:36.959
Let's do it again, soon.
Yeah, we'll call you.

06:37.027 --> 06:38.227
They're your friends!

06:38.245 --> 06:40.680
Why would you just blatantly lie
to them like that?

06:40.747 --> 06:43.282
Well, that's what you say
at the end of a crappy date.

06:43.283 --> 06:45.534
Hey, Ted.
Great time last night.

06:45.585 --> 06:48.070
Well, let's do it again, soon.
I'll... uh, call you.

06:49.940 --> 06:51.824
Right?

06:52.592 --> 06:53.643
Who was that?

06:53.710 --> 06:54.860
Oh, I don't want to brag,

06:54.928 --> 06:57.029
But it seems chicks
are really digging

06:57.097 --> 06:58.297
The whole professor thing.

06:58.365 --> 06:59.382
Last night,

06:59.449 --> 07:00.800
She picked me up at the bar.

07:00.867 --> 07:03.469
And then...
Well, she actually

07:03.553 --> 07:05.104
Wound up falling asleep
on the couch.

07:05.188 --> 07:08.424
But, hey, that happens.

07:08.492 --> 07:09.959
Uh, no, it doesn't.

07:10.027 --> 07:11.243
Sure, it does.

07:11.278 --> 07:12.545
You know, she was,

07:12.612 --> 07:14.864
She was just exhausted
from being turned on.

07:14.898 --> 07:16.065
But you heard her.

07:16.133 --> 07:18.984
She wants to do it again, soon.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.454
Ted, let me ask you a question.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.889
Where does this girl
live, exactly?

07:23.957 --> 07:25.057
Westchester. Why?

07:28.478 --> 07:29.912
You're the sexless innkeeper.

07:29.980 --> 07:31.747
Oh, my god!
You're right!

07:31.815 --> 07:33.282
He's totally
the sexless innkeeper!

07:33.316 --> 07:36.135
What the hell is
"the sexless innkeeper"?

07:36.219 --> 07:39.472
Ted, many a man--
nay, many a soul--

07:39.556 --> 07:41.924
Has their own tale of
the sexless innkeeper.

07:41.975 --> 07:44.593
Why, I had run-in
with one just last year.

07:44.661 --> 07:46.645
I even composed
a poem about it.

07:46.730 --> 07:48.481
Would you care to hear it?
Not really.

07:48.565 --> 07:50.316
T'was the night
before new year's,

07:50.400 --> 07:52.601
And the weather grew mean.

07:52.652 --> 07:54.370
It was 3:00 in the morning,

07:54.438 --> 07:56.989
And I was stranded in queens.

07:57.074 --> 07:59.658
<i>The tavern grew empty,</i>

07:59.743 --> 08:02.111
<i>The gas lights grew dim.</i>

08:02.162 --> 08:05.865
<i>The horse-drawn carriages
were all but snowed in...</i>

08:05.932 --> 08:07.166
Wait. If this was last year,

08:07.234 --> 08:09.034
<i>Why are you acting like it
was Oliver Twist?</i>

08:09.102 --> 08:11.487
Ted, it's a poem.

08:12.789 --> 08:14.423
<i>Last call was approaching,</i>

08:14.491 --> 08:16.492
<i>And my fortunes looked bleak.</i>

08:16.543 --> 08:18.827
<i>Then I turned to my left</i>

08:18.879 --> 08:21.180
<i>And stifled a shriek.</i>

08:21.264 --> 08:23.599
<i>She had a peach fuzz beard</i>

08:23.666 --> 08:26.385
<i>And weighed 16 stone.</i>

08:26.470 --> 08:28.437
<i>She gobbled up hot wings</i>

08:28.505 --> 08:30.990
<i>And swallowed the bones.</i>

08:31.057 --> 08:32.640
<i>I muffled a scream</i>

08:32.692 --> 08:34.842
<i>And threw up in my mouth.</i>

08:34.895 --> 08:37.446
<i>I asked, "where do you live?"</i>

08:37.514 --> 08:40.682
<i>And she said,
"one block south."</i>

08:40.734 --> 08:43.535
<i>I swallowed my pride</i>

08:43.620 --> 08:46.455
<i>And six shots of whiskey.</i>

08:48.825 --> 08:50.176
<i>And prayed to the gods</i>

08:50.243 --> 08:53.078
<i>That she wasn't too frisky.</i>

08:53.163 --> 08:57.416
<i>Back in her cave,
she prepared us a snack.</i>

08:57.417 --> 09:02.254
<i>'Neath her mighty hooves,
the floorboards did crack.</i>

09:02.339 --> 09:04.473
<i>But when she returned,</i>

09:04.541 --> 09:06.859
<i>She found a sound sleeper.</i>

09:06.927 --> 09:09.678
<i>And thus she became</i>

09:09.729 --> 09:12.898
<i>The sexless innkeeper.</i>

09:12.983 --> 09:14.266
And so are you

09:14.351 --> 09:15.835
Wait, you're saying that girl

09:15.902 --> 09:17.753
Just used me
for a place to crash?

09:17.821 --> 09:20.322
Ted, you mentioned that
you live right upstairs.

09:20.390 --> 09:23.192
She saw the tweed jacket
which basically says

09:23.243 --> 09:27.112
You're not interested in, nor
probably even capable of, having sex.

09:27.197 --> 09:29.882
And she thought,
"hey, free lodging."

09:29.950 --> 09:31.450
No way.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.385
I'm not the sexless innkeeper.

09:33.420 --> 09:35.454
Ted, that girl
had no intention

09:35.539 --> 09:37.089
Of ever hooking
up with you.

09:37.174 --> 09:39.074
Which is funny,
because usually

09:39.142 --> 09:42.261
It's the innkeeper who offers
turndown service. Oh!

09:44.714 --> 09:46.632
Hey, guys. Good news.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.551
First of all, you can ignore
all the e-mails

09:48.602 --> 09:49.802
And texts we've sent you.

09:49.886 --> 09:51.787
We have. Go on.

09:51.855 --> 09:53.222
Because we went
ahead and booked

09:53.273 --> 09:55.741
That couples' weekend
for all of us in Vermont!

09:55.809 --> 09:57.593
Wait, you guys were
serious about that?

09:57.694 --> 09:59.261
Oh, we never
joke about b&b's,

09:59.312 --> 10:00.946
Especially at the height
of syrup season.

10:01.031 --> 10:02.064
Check it out.

10:02.132 --> 10:04.033
Saturday we've got
apple-picking,

10:04.100 --> 10:07.586
Antiquing, then
a hated hay ride.

10:07.654 --> 10:10.906
And then on Sunday, we're up at
6:00 a.m. for the fall foliage hike.

10:10.974 --> 10:13.742
Now, you better pack your long johns,
'cause it is cold up there.

10:13.810 --> 10:18.464
Look! I'm sorry that we have been
dodging your calls,

10:18.548 --> 10:20.049
But we respect
you guys too much

10:20.116 --> 10:21.950
As friends to give
you some song and dance.

10:22.002 --> 10:23.152
You deserve the truth.

10:27.641 --> 10:31.627
The US Navy has found
intelligent alien life

10:31.678 --> 10:33.195
At the bottom of the ocean.

10:33.263 --> 10:36.315
For reasons I can't
explain, Robin and I

10:36.399 --> 10:38.767
Have been tapped
to lead the expedition.

10:38.835 --> 10:40.119
Wow, Barney.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.738
That kind of sounds like
the stuff you say to girls

10:42.805 --> 10:45.274
When you're too much of a
coward to dump them. Yeah.

10:45.342 --> 10:47.526
You know, that's exactly
what it sounds like.

10:47.611 --> 10:49.962
But if that's true,
that's awesome.

10:50.030 --> 10:52.281
What's going on?

10:52.349 --> 10:55.834
Look, all the couple-y stuff,
it's just not us.

10:55.919 --> 10:58.320
Barney and I are barely equipped
to date each other,

10:58.371 --> 10:59.538
Let alone you guys.

10:59.539 --> 11:03.142
Plus, the alien thing.

11:03.209 --> 11:04.993
Come on, Marshall.
Let's go.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.962
No... Lily...
You know what?

11:07.013 --> 11:11.600
I hope those underwater aliens
are cold-blooded.

11:11.668 --> 11:14.770
'Cause then you guys will
get along just fine.

11:20.143 --> 11:22.061
I think they bought it.

11:23.713 --> 11:25.981
I can't believe they
broke up with us.

11:26.032 --> 11:28.784
We're so lovable.

11:28.851 --> 11:31.287
No, we're not.
We're ugly and gross.

11:31.321 --> 11:33.739
I thought we did
everything right.

11:33.823 --> 11:35.040
I know!

11:35.125 --> 11:36.742
I know. We had the gouda.

11:36.826 --> 11:38.077
We had my waffle story.

11:38.161 --> 11:40.379
I even sent them a
awesome photo montage.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.749
Nothing.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.001
Oh, dear god.

11:46.069 --> 11:48.721
Marshall, we've been
over and over this.

11:48.805 --> 11:51.373
You have to stop
sending those to people.

11:51.441 --> 11:52.858
<i>It was true.</i>

11:52.926 --> 11:55.227
<i>Marshall had become addicted
to creating songs</i>

11:55.295 --> 11:58.664
<i>And photo montages documenting
various mundane events.</i>

11:58.732 --> 12:00.316
<i>So for months,
all of Marshall's</i>

12:00.383 --> 12:01.767
<i>friends and professional
colleagues</i>

12:01.835 --> 12:03.335
<i>Were getting e-mails
like this...</i>

12:03.403 --> 12:06.722
* ordered Chinese food today *

12:06.773 --> 12:10.676
* some moo shu pork sauce
got away *

12:10.744 --> 12:12.277
* flipped the cushion *

12:12.345 --> 12:16.081
* now everything's okay. *

12:18.601 --> 12:21.920
* Cat-sitting for Lily's mom *

12:22.005 --> 12:25.407
* cat-sitting
for Lily's mom *

12:25.458 --> 12:26.908
* it's gonna be fun *

12:26.960 --> 12:31.080
* it's gonna bring us all
closer together. *

12:33.299 --> 12:36.435
* Cat funeral *

12:36.469 --> 12:39.605
* cat funeral *

12:39.689 --> 12:43.075
* it was an accident *

12:43.143 --> 12:46.895
* and not entirely my fault *

12:46.946 --> 12:50.366
<i>* cat funeral *
* meow, meow, meow, meow *</i>

12:50.433 --> 12:54.620
<i>* meow, meow, meow, meow *
* cat funeral *</i>

12:54.738 --> 12:56.722
We'll miss you, whiskers.

12:56.790 --> 13:00.426
<i>* Meow, meow, meow, meow,
meow... *</i>

13:02.128 --> 13:04.997
I can't believe you
sent them one of those.

13:05.081 --> 13:07.082
They think we're insane now.

13:07.150 --> 13:09.001
If I recall, they didn't dump us

13:09.085 --> 13:10.836
Until you brought up
that Vermont trip.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.237
It was way too early.

13:12.305 --> 13:13.722
First, a boat ride
around the city,

13:13.790 --> 13:15.190
Then a trip to Vermont.

13:15.258 --> 13:17.493
It's a rookie mistake,
and you're better than that.

13:17.560 --> 13:18.861
Oh, what about you forgetting

13:18.928 --> 13:21.230
To check the egg timer
for charades?

13:21.264 --> 13:24.600
I gave you one thing
to do, Marshall. One thing.

13:24.667 --> 13:25.851
One thing?

13:26.536 --> 13:27.519
One thing?

13:28.838 --> 13:30.806
Wow. Really?

13:31.658 --> 13:34.142
So, I guess that gouda

13:34.194 --> 13:36.695
Just walked itself
right through the door...

13:37.614 --> 13:39.615
...Sliced itself up,

13:39.666 --> 13:43.368
And arranged itself
in a perfect semi-circle

13:43.453 --> 13:48.290
Around not three, not four...

13:48.358 --> 13:50.325
But five different kinds

13:50.376 --> 13:53.429
Of sturdy,
cheese-bearing crackers?

13:54.848 --> 13:57.316
You're a sturdy,
cheese-bearing cracker!

13:58.952 --> 14:01.937
Guys, Lily and Marshall haven't
been to the bar all week.

14:02.004 --> 14:03.172
They're taking
this really hard.

14:03.239 --> 14:05.307
Ted, I could listen to
this guilt trip all day,

14:05.358 --> 14:07.726
But don't you have to
get back up to the inn?

14:07.811 --> 14:09.678
I mean, who's working
the front desk?

14:09.712 --> 14:12.030
Seriously, they're
your friends.

14:12.115 --> 14:13.315
You got to go apologize.

14:13.383 --> 14:16.735
To your point, Ted,
as an innkeeper,

14:16.803 --> 14:18.403
Do you do that cheapy thing

14:18.488 --> 14:20.873
Where you only change
the linens upon request?

14:20.957 --> 14:24.993
I mean, I mean, I mean, how much
water is that actually saving?

14:25.061 --> 14:26.361
Robin, you know I'm right.

14:26.412 --> 14:27.996
Ignoring a problem
doesn't make it go away.

14:28.047 --> 14:29.264
Usually,
it just makes it bigger.

14:29.332 --> 14:30.699
You're right.

14:30.767 --> 14:31.917
Thank you.

14:31.985 --> 14:34.002
All that sexlessness
has made you wise.

14:34.053 --> 14:35.754
For god's sake!

14:35.755 --> 14:37.172
Mint on the pillow, Ted!

14:37.223 --> 14:39.391
And don't charge for wi-fi.
It seems greedy! It does.

14:42.228 --> 14:43.479
<i>But eventually,</i>

14:43.546 --> 14:45.514
<i>Even Barney and Robin
had to admit</i>

14:45.565 --> 14:47.766
<i>They owed Lily and Marshall
an apology.</i>

14:47.767 --> 14:49.351
Hey.

14:49.402 --> 14:51.170
We wanted to say we're sorry.

14:51.237 --> 14:53.505
Oh. I wish you had called.

14:53.573 --> 14:55.524
I swear, he was right there

14:55.592 --> 14:57.359
Just eating a Belgian waffle!

14:58.928 --> 15:00.112
Well, he can't
have enjoyed it

15:00.196 --> 15:01.580
As much as I'm enjoying
this gouda!

15:01.664 --> 15:02.714
Oh!

15:02.782 --> 15:04.616
Um, listen,

15:04.701 --> 15:06.752
Now's not a good time.

15:06.836 --> 15:08.253
We'll call you.

15:08.338 --> 15:10.071
Wai.t We just want...

15:16.884 --> 15:19.551
Hey! Hey, guys.
Hey. Long time no see.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.569
Have a seat.
Sit.

15:20.637 --> 15:23.521
Oh, we can't.
We're here with Py and Shea.

15:23.572 --> 15:24.873
Yeah, sorry.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.725
Oh, it's just... We haven't
seen you guys all week.

15:27.162 --> 15:29.350
Hey, maybe all six of us could hang out.
Yeah.

15:29.364 --> 15:32.898
Oh, it might be weird.
We're kind of on a double date.

15:32.949 --> 15:35.968
Wouldn't want you to feel
like a fifth and sixth wheel.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.204
Who the hell are these people?

15:38.255 --> 15:40.422
They just moved
here from Hawaii.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.908
Py is a total foodie and Shea, well...
Mmm!

15:43.959 --> 15:45.477
She's...

15:45.545 --> 15:47.596
Shea... Shea is just...

15:51.034 --> 15:53.751
Anyhoo, we can't stay long.

15:53.819 --> 15:56.188
We're just gonna grab a quick
beer and then take these kooks

15:56.255 --> 15:57.806
For a boat ride
around the city.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.726
Wow, it sounds like this is
getting pretty serious.

16:00.810 --> 16:02.695
Well, we don't want
to jinx it, but, uh...

16:02.762 --> 16:05.281
We kind of think
they might be the two.

16:06.650 --> 16:08.651
Ooh.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.404
Pfft, who needs 'em?

16:12.455 --> 16:15.241
Pfft. Not us.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.918
* Livin' alone *

16:25.969 --> 16:30.122
* we think of all the friends
we've known *

16:32.309 --> 16:37.680
* but when
we dial the telephone *

16:37.747 --> 16:39.765
* nobody's home *

16:42.068 --> 16:44.019
Hi. Two for dinner.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.121
Just the two of you?

16:48.608 --> 16:53.412
* All by ourselves *

16:54.464 --> 16:56.498
* don't want to be *

16:56.583 --> 17:03.372
* all by ourselves anymore *

17:04.590 --> 17:07.492
* all by ourselves... *

17:07.544 --> 17:09.811
Hey, why don't we call

17:09.878 --> 17:11.680
That weird couple
down the hall from you?

17:11.748 --> 17:13.182
You know, with the ferrets?

17:13.249 --> 17:15.467
Maybe they want to come over
and play taboo.

17:15.518 --> 17:17.019
After midnight?
No way.

17:17.103 --> 17:19.637
We can't tabooty-call
them, it's pathetic.

17:19.705 --> 17:21.740
Hey, guys.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.743
Barney,
are you wearing sweat pants?

17:25.811 --> 17:29.999
Maybe. But they're Armani.

17:30.066 --> 17:32.401
Okay, guys, I've got
some bad news for you.

17:32.518 --> 17:34.486
So I'm just going
to come out and say it.

17:34.537 --> 17:36.238
You're a couple.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.890
And no matter how hard
you try to fight it,

17:37.957 --> 17:40.025
Couples need other couples.

17:40.076 --> 17:42.294
That's why you miss
Marshall and Lily.

17:42.362 --> 17:43.879
And can't you just admit that?

17:45.815 --> 17:49.051
Oh, yeah!

17:49.135 --> 17:50.619
That was amazing, Lily!

17:50.687 --> 17:52.004
I know!

17:52.072 --> 17:55.240
When I got that left-hand-
yellow, I was like, "what?!"

17:55.308 --> 17:57.026
You guys are the best.

17:57.093 --> 17:57.993
Oh, right back at you!

18:33.596 --> 18:35.080
Ding.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.960
For charades.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.615
How do we know you two
won't hurt us again?

18:53.700 --> 18:55.401
You don't.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.069
You know what?

18:57.120 --> 19:01.323
We have two very nice people
up in that apartment

19:01.408 --> 19:03.942
Who are perfect for us.

19:03.993 --> 19:05.327
Then what are you doing,

19:05.412 --> 19:08.564
Standing out in
the rain with us?

19:08.631 --> 19:09.998
Damn it.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.836
Why is there something so
attractive about a bad boy...

19:13.920 --> 19:15.220
And girl?

19:16.506 --> 19:18.507
I think we can change them.

19:19.976 --> 19:21.293
Come here, you two.

19:25.648 --> 19:28.484
We'll never sleep
on the gouda again.

19:29.903 --> 19:34.239
* All by ourselves... *

19:36.190 --> 19:37.857
Hey, Barney. I got
a little poem for you.

19:37.924 --> 19:39.525
You want to hear it?
No, not really.

19:39.662 --> 19:43.613
'Twas the night
before, I had hours to kill.

19:43.697 --> 19:47.617
<i>I sat in the tavern,
grading parchments with quill.</i>

19:47.701 --> 19:48.634
With quill?

19:48.702 --> 19:50.820
Barney. It's a poem.

19:52.373 --> 19:54.824
<i>A busty, young lassie
flashed me a grin.</i>

19:54.908 --> 19:58.945
<i>Her garb said "classy,"
but her eyes whispered "sin."</i>

19:59.013 --> 20:01.914
<i>She said, "you're a teacher?"</i>

20:01.965 --> 20:03.599
<i>I said, "yes, indeed."</i>

20:03.634 --> 20:05.251
<i>"I must have you," she moaned.</i>

20:05.302 --> 20:07.670
<i>"I'm turned on by tweed."</i>

20:08.806 --> 20:10.423
<i>With haste we did scamper</i>

20:10.474 --> 20:12.058
<i>To my chamber anon.</i>

20:12.125 --> 20:17.230
<i>We fell to the couch,
and, bro, it was on.</i>

20:17.297 --> 20:18.815
<i>I unlaced her bodice.</i>

20:18.899 --> 20:20.650
<i>Our passions grew deeper.</i>

20:20.734 --> 20:25.988
<i>And thus ends the tale
of the sexless innkeeper.</i>

20:27.408 --> 20:29.108
No way.

20:29.159 --> 20:30.910
You made that up.

20:31.995 --> 20:34.797
Are you coming back
bed, professor?

20:37.534 --> 20:39.118
Whew!

20:39.186 --> 20:40.653
God, I love being single.

20:42.623 --> 20:46.709
Barney, you ready for brunch
with Lily and Marshall?

20:46.827 --> 20:48.044
What have I done?
