Narrator: Tonight,
Michael Rubin, founder of

00:03.470 --> 00:05.405
the multi-billion dollar
sports retail behemoth Fanatics,

00:05.405 --> 00:06.573
joins the Tank.

00:06.573 --> 00:09.343
I want to give
the opportunity to the consumer,

00:09.343 --> 00:10.277
to the fan.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.212
We prep.
You bake.

00:12.212 --> 00:13.480
There had to be a better way.

00:13.480 --> 00:15.716
And now there is,
because I invented it.

00:15.716 --> 00:17.184
O'Leary: You have to change
your business model.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.585
You're cheating.

00:18.585 --> 00:20.187
We're helping
the common person.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.755
I like business.
I like making money.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.657
There is no goofing off
in this business.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.559
Get realistic about this.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.561
No, I like this.
I want these guys all to myself.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.962
Guys, do not be bullied by him.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.664
You got me.
That's a better Shark, anyway.

00:30.664 --> 00:33.667
Ooh.
It's the battle of billionaires.
Let's go.

to compete with technology.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.223
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Maurice Bachelor,

00:56.223 --> 00:57.624
and I'm from
Cleveland, Ohio.

00:57.624 --> 00:58.959
And my name
is Joel Griffith,

00:58.959 --> 01:00.327
and I'm from Trenton,
New Jersey.

01:00.327 --> 01:02.462
And together
we founded Bot-It,

01:02.462 --> 01:04.097
a website and mobile app

01:04.097 --> 01:05.966
that uses
artificial intelligence

01:05.966 --> 01:08.068
to complete online tasks.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.837
We're seeking
a $150,000 investment

01:10.837 --> 01:13.507
for a 10% stake
in our company.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.442
So, Sharks,
have you ever gone online

01:15.442 --> 01:17.344
to reserve
a dinner reservation,

01:17.344 --> 01:19.179
book a golf tee time,

01:19.179 --> 01:20.747
or buy concert tickets,

01:20.747 --> 01:25.052
and notice that
they're gone in seconds?

01:25.052 --> 01:26.987
Well, that's because
an online robot,

01:26.987 --> 01:28.822
also known as a bot,

01:28.822 --> 01:30.624
probably just
outbooked you.

01:30.624 --> 01:33.794
Bots now control
50% of online traffic

01:33.794 --> 01:35.829
for things like
booking reservations

01:35.829 --> 01:37.164
and making online purchases.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.598
But how can humans compete?

01:38.598 --> 01:41.335
It's almost impossible
to click as fast as a bot.

01:41.335 --> 01:45.038
And it's annoying to have
to sit at a computer,

01:45.038 --> 01:47.708
keep clicking refresh...
[ Laughter ]

01:47.708 --> 01:49.776
...hoping that
you're the lucky one

01:49.776 --> 01:52.446
to buy those concert tickets
before they disappear.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.349
Or having to set your alarm
for the crack of dawn,

01:55.349 --> 01:58.352
hoping to book a reservation
for a popular restaurant...
[ Laughter ]

01:58.352 --> 02:01.355
...only to find that a bot
has already beat you to it.

02:01.355 --> 02:02.723
Let's say, for example,

02:02.723 --> 02:04.291
you're looking
to book a reservation

02:04.291 --> 02:06.860
at one of our
favorite restaurants,

02:06.860 --> 02:08.862
Mr. Wonderful's
Fish and Chips,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.731
one of the best restaurants
in the world.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.500
You can select from one
of our pre-built bots

02:13.500 --> 02:15.769
to start automating
in seconds.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.304
Or you can customize,

02:17.304 --> 02:19.439
and we'll
build one for you.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.775
It's that simple.

02:21.775 --> 02:23.644
So, Sharks,
next time you're looking

02:23.644 --> 02:25.212
to book a golf tee time...

02:25.212 --> 02:26.179
Bot-It.

02:26.179 --> 02:27.848
Need tickets
to a popular concert?

02:27.848 --> 02:28.682
Bot-It.

02:28.682 --> 02:29.850
Want to impress your friends

02:29.850 --> 02:30.851
by having a reservation

02:30.851 --> 02:33.320
at the hottest restaurant
in town?

02:33.320 --> 02:34.321
Bot-It. Bot-It.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.223
So, Sharks,
now that you got it,

02:36.223 --> 02:38.291
let's Bot-It.
[ Laughter ]

02:38.291 --> 02:40.093
Good presentation.
That's a great start.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.962
If you don't mind, gentlemen,
help me understand

02:41.962 --> 02:44.064
why a bot beats you
to the reservation,

02:44.064 --> 02:45.532
why it has such
an advantage.

02:45.532 --> 02:46.933
And I'm sure
not everyone knows,

02:46.933 --> 02:47.901
what is a bot?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.803
A bot is --
well, it's a robot.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.605
It's going to automate
a manual process.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.939
So it's a program?
Yeah, yeah.

02:52.939 --> 02:55.175
We built an application
that allows you to be able

02:55.175 --> 02:57.678
to go on any website
and be able to say,

02:57.678 --> 02:59.513
"Hey, step one,
click this button.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.947
Step two, log in.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.116
Step three,
type in this information."

03:03.116 --> 03:05.585
Our back-end system
then takes that information

03:05.585 --> 03:07.154
and automates
that process for you.

03:07.154 --> 03:09.156
So, it just does it over and
over and over and over again

03:09.156 --> 03:10.590
until it gets through?
As many times --

03:10.590 --> 03:12.325
You can set the schedule,
you can do anything you like.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.895
So a popular female singer
that sells out in seconds.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.197
If you have Bot-It,
you can be in that stack, too.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.632
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

03:18.632 --> 03:21.068
Okay, so, humans
don't really matter anymore.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.069
This is good.
[ Laughter ]

03:22.069 --> 03:23.437
This is
a real issue.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.372
We have probably billions
of dollars of products

03:25.372 --> 03:27.307
that bots try to buy
from us each year.

03:27.307 --> 03:30.043
We, at Topps, when we make
a card release,

03:30.043 --> 03:31.511
bots come
to get everything.

03:31.511 --> 03:33.647
When we release
a new Mitchell & Ness jersey,

03:33.647 --> 03:35.415
same thing --
A bot tries to come in.

03:35.415 --> 03:37.117
We've built software
to eliminate that.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.985
And aren't all
the bigger companies

03:38.985 --> 03:42.255
gonna build something to really
eliminate a bot from being able

03:42.255 --> 03:44.524
to successfully do
what it's supposed to do?

03:44.524 --> 03:45.959
That's a great question,
Michael.

03:45.959 --> 03:47.461
So, we've built
our technology

03:47.461 --> 03:49.229
to now be able
to be undetectable.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.364
So we can get on any website
that we need to

03:51.364 --> 03:53.500
in order to run
our software systems.
Cuban: So what you're saying --

03:53.500 --> 03:56.703
"I can get whatever I want
from a drop at Fanatics."
[ Laughs ]

03:56.703 --> 03:57.537
So, yeah,
that's the beauty.

03:57.537 --> 03:58.638
But we're doing it in --

03:58.638 --> 04:00.207
We follow all
the standard practices

04:00.207 --> 04:02.309
when it comes to
automation,

04:02.309 --> 04:04.044
and we make sure
that we don't do anything

04:04.044 --> 04:06.113
that's outside
of what's regulated.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.748
What are your sales?
You making any money?

04:08.748 --> 04:11.051
So, right now, we have
a subscription-based model.

04:11.051 --> 04:14.187
So, currently, we have
over $30,000 in sales.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.689
We just started
three months ago,

04:15.689 --> 04:18.892
and we have over 350
current subscribers.

04:18.892 --> 04:20.827
And one thing
that Joel didn't mention --

04:20.827 --> 04:22.262
We also do B2B.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.565
So, we signed up the largest
shipping logistics company

04:25.565 --> 04:27.434
in Turkey using our service.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.202
What does it cost
for a subscription?

04:29.202 --> 04:30.637
The cost for
one subscription

04:30.637 --> 04:33.140
will be up to $40
for our standard package,

04:33.140 --> 04:35.542
then up to $300
for our pro package.

04:35.542 --> 04:37.611
And then we have
a couple upsell items.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.945
You can run a bot
every 15 minutes

04:38.945 --> 04:41.348
to pick up canceled tee times,
anything like that.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.517
Like, if I want to do this
as a consumer,

04:43.517 --> 04:46.753
if I want to go buy
a Travis Scott release at Nike,

04:46.753 --> 04:47.988
how quick is it
for me to sign up?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.956
Seconds, seconds.
Seconds?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.725
Our bots
build themselves.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.560
Sometimes we do have
to set it up manually.

04:53.560 --> 04:56.763
Yeah.
An example.
So, this is the process
of setting up a bot,

04:56.763 --> 05:00.133
and all of our technology
is custom-built by my hands.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.636
So, I'm a -- My background
is in software engineering.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.904
We want to hear
more about you.
So tell us about you,
tell us about you.

05:03.904 --> 05:04.871
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

05:04.871 --> 05:07.240
So, like,
over the last 15 years,

05:07.240 --> 05:10.210
I've been starting
and scaling businesses.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.612
I helped start the mobile
division at LegalZoom.

05:12.612 --> 05:14.181
How did you guys
get together?

05:14.181 --> 05:16.516
So, we met through
a mutual friend playing golf.

05:16.516 --> 05:18.218
I'm originally from
Trenton, New Jersey.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.653
After graduating
from Morehouse College,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.589
I spent 10 years working
in social media advertising

05:22.589 --> 05:25.759
for companies like
LinkedIn, Snapchat,

05:25.759 --> 05:28.328
Amazon advertising,
and most recently, TikTok.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.130
Guys, is there another
competitive product to this?

05:30.130 --> 05:32.132
Is somebody else doing this
for consumers?

05:32.132 --> 05:34.367
So, on the B2B side, yes.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.602
Can individuals use it?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.804
If I just want to buy
one Taylor Swift ticket

05:37.804 --> 05:39.206
or I want to buy one...
No, as far as --

05:39.206 --> 05:41.308
It's only for businesses?
That's what
separates us,

05:41.308 --> 05:42.542
is that we have
the B2C side.

05:42.542 --> 05:44.511
No, you can, they just --
it's just not pre-configured

05:44.511 --> 05:45.912
for typical
consumer things.

05:45.912 --> 05:47.514
Let me ask you
a different question.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.115
In society today,

05:49.115 --> 05:51.918
the use of bots
is becoming a moral issue.

05:51.918 --> 05:55.021
If you think about it from
being a very public investor...

05:55.021 --> 05:58.491
Sure.
...what does it say about us
if we're supporting this

05:58.491 --> 06:00.694
for those that think
you're cheating?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.829
So, that's part of the reason
why we're here today.

06:02.829 --> 06:05.799
We want to help change
the perception of bots
amongst consumers.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.367
Bots aren't always
the bad guy,

06:07.367 --> 06:08.335
and you can
have one, too,

06:08.335 --> 06:09.336
and it can do the same thing
to help you.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.470
See, we're trying
to eliminate them,

06:10.470 --> 06:11.805
to be honest,
at Fanatics.

06:11.805 --> 06:13.139
You may say
it's a moral dilemma.

06:13.139 --> 06:16.409
I'd much rather an individual
try to get us with a bot,

06:16.409 --> 06:18.511
than a business
try to get us with a bot.
Corcoran: For sure.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.746
So at least, you know,
they're supporting --

06:19.746 --> 06:21.214
O'Leary: Well, how do you feel
about the world knowing

06:21.214 --> 06:23.383
that Michael Rubin
invested in bots?
I-I don't know.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.151
I'd be fine
with it -- for me.
I'm thinking about that.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.519
But I'd rather
disrupt myself

06:26.519 --> 06:27.988
than have someone else
disrupt me.
Always. Always.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.823
And so, right now,
I know we're fighting.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.792
We're doing everything we can to
stop B2B bots, because, for us,

06:32.792 --> 06:34.728
we want to give things
to the actual consumer.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.729
So, in a lot of ways...
Right.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.230
We're helping
the common person.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.365
That's exactly what --
In a lot of ways --

06:38.365 --> 06:39.766
Well, it's
already existing.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.468
Being a common
person here...

06:41.468 --> 06:43.536
You're not common, Lori.
I'm not super tech-y.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.705
I actually think
I'm pretty normal.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.540
I am not super tech-y.
Yeah, right.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.509
And I'm thinking,
like, restaurants.

06:49.509 --> 06:51.945
A lot of people, they go,
"Oh, you know,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.381
I want to go to my favorite
X, Y, Z restaurant tonight.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.682
Can't get in."

06:55.682 --> 06:57.784
This is not gonna really
help you for that, right?
No.

06:57.784 --> 06:59.219
But where
there's contention

06:59.219 --> 07:01.788
is when something opens up
at a specific time.
Right.

07:01.788 --> 07:02.989
So, they're going to say,

07:02.989 --> 07:06.493
"We have 62 tee times
at 8:00 a.m. on Tuesday,"

07:06.493 --> 07:08.728
or, "We're opening up
online reservations

07:08.728 --> 07:10.864
to our new restaurant..."
And they
immediately grab it.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.599
But it's future
site things.
Griffith:
It immediately grabs it.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.134
There's nothing that
you have to do from your end.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.469
It's interesting to me,
because I think there's a lot

07:16.469 --> 07:17.304
of different directions
you can go.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.905
But then, with all the new

07:18.905 --> 07:20.340
AI stuff that's coming out...
Exactly.

07:20.340 --> 07:21.641
...people are going to be
more aware

07:21.641 --> 07:24.010
and more interested in
doing these types of things

07:24.010 --> 07:25.078
if you can create
the right user interface.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.279
Oh, yes.
Exactly.

07:26.279 --> 07:28.948
So, I'll give you the 150K,
but I want 20%.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.083
Rubin: Hold on.

is going to immediately think,
