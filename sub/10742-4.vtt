20:44.243 --> 20:45.242
                   That's right.

20:45.277 --> 20:47.211
               I've known Grover
                  all my life,

20:47.246 --> 20:49.413

           before my wedding

20:49.448 --> 20:50.748
                   to tell me
               that he loves me.

But I thought
you loved Tony.

disappointed in Tony.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.230
 He lacks

All I wanted to do
was to try to help him.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.406
And-- And he seems to
resent it.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.777
    Well, on the day before
         your wedding,

21:19.812 --> 21:21.011
  I'd say you have a problem.

     Now, listen, Melissa,
      there's a few things

21:29.689 --> 21:31.021
 I wanna get straightened out.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.691
      In the first place,
 I don't want your ex-boyfriend

21:33.726 --> 21:35.358
          telling me where
        I'm gonna honeymoon.

21:35.394 --> 21:38.261
    And I don't like my best man
        being picked for me.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.598
   And I don't like having plans
        made for my future,

I brought you a drink.

22:08.193 --> 22:11.194
             That was fantastic.

               it was fantastic.
