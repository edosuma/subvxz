WEBVTT

00:22.000 --> 00:24.001
UAV is a go for launch, sir.

00:25.359 --> 00:26.736
Launch.

00:29.879 --> 00:32.548
That never gets old. I love that.

00:32.600 --> 00:37.648
UAV will arrive at PJ2-445
in three... two... one.

00:39.920 --> 00:43.758
Automatic Terrain Radar System
is functioning.

00:43.759 --> 00:48.359
If this technology works out, we'll be able
to do more long-range reconnaissance.

00:48.359 --> 00:49.359
Cool.

00:51.198 --> 00:55.119
Sensors are indicating
sporadic spots of heat.

00:57.679 --> 00:59.682
(Hammond) What are they?

00:59.759 --> 01:03.137
When we were there yesterday,
we didn't get this far from the gate.

01:03.159 --> 01:05.995
It could be anything.
Air vents, warm-water springs...

01:06.040 --> 01:09.168
Perhaps... life forms?

01:09.198 --> 01:12.326
Motion detectors
don't indicate any movement, sir.

01:12.359 --> 01:15.362
- Losing signal.
- What? That shouldn't be happening.

01:15.399 --> 01:17.400
Switching to manual control.

01:24.478 --> 01:26.313
Come on, Captain. Pull it up.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.775
I can't, sir.

01:31.237 --> 01:34.658
- Lost signal. Trying to re-establish.
- This doesn't make sense.

01:34.679 --> 01:38.997
This UAV was specially designed
for exactly this type of radio control.

01:38.998 --> 01:40.877
What was that it crashed into?

01:41.837 --> 01:45.299
I'm no botanist, sir,
but it looked like some sort of plant life.

01:45.317 --> 01:48.822
We have visual contact re-established.

01:51.558 --> 01:55.798
We didn't... need that UAV, did we, sir?

01:55.798 --> 02:01.197
Uh... I need the flight recorder, sir,
to determine why the controls failed.

02:01.198 --> 02:04.451
Estimated distance from the gate
is 10 miles.

02:04.477 --> 02:07.397
Aie! Six hours there and back.

02:20.877 --> 02:24.673
That would confirm
the presence of life forms on PJ2-445.

02:35.117 --> 02:40.290
Well... I guess that changes
the priority of this mission, eh, sir?

03:57.115 --> 04:00.995
- (Daniel) DÃ©jÅ• vu.
- (Teal'c) I am unfamiliar with that term.

04:00.996 --> 04:03.873
Um, it means
I feel like I've been here before.

04:04.877 --> 04:06.962
That is correct, Daniel Jackson.

04:07.036 --> 04:10.122
Yesterday,
when we first arrived on this planet.

04:11.637 --> 04:13.639
Right. What was I thinking?

04:18.516 --> 04:19.516
Atchoo!

04:20.156 --> 04:21.156
Bless.

04:21.237 --> 04:24.324
I'm not picking up
the locating beacon on the UAV...

04:24.355 --> 04:27.276
but the crash site should be this way.

04:27.315 --> 04:32.396
I thought the alien on the video looked
fairly docile-more curious than harmful.

04:32.396 --> 04:36.149
I thought it looked bald, white and naked.

04:36.156 --> 04:39.701
(Teal'c) Since it is their planet,
is it not we who are the aliens?

04:39.715 --> 04:42.384
(Daniel) The word alien
refers to anything...

04:42.396 --> 04:45.649
characteristic of
a very different place or culture.

04:45.675 --> 04:48.596
Anything strange
relative from our own perspective.

04:48.634 --> 04:53.014
(O'Neill) Think we call you alien
because you're from Chulak? Ha!

05:00.156 --> 05:02.492
Kinda weird, huh?

05:02.555 --> 05:04.723
Captain, why don't you start...

05:04.795 --> 05:08.875
Plant life on Earth accounts for more
than 80%% % of our medicinal resources.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.629
- We should really check it out.
- Check it out.

05:14.115 --> 05:16.451
These other ones must not be full-grown.

05:17.915 --> 05:19.793
Atchoo!

05:19.875 --> 05:20.875
Bless.

05:20.954 --> 05:22.957
Oh, boy.

05:24.555 --> 05:26.975
The UAV was dragged in that direction.

05:30.634 --> 05:32.637
And that direction it is.

05:47.113 --> 05:48.490
Dwellings.

05:48.595 --> 05:50.137
Lots of 'em.

06:07.074 --> 06:08.742
(softly) Um, Jack.

06:08.834 --> 06:10.377
Yeah?

06:10.473 --> 06:12.475
- (clears throat)
- What?

06:23.473 --> 06:24.473
Hi.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.855
Well, I guess
that was the wrong thing to say.

06:48.713 --> 06:51.050
(O'Neill) What do you think, Daniel?

06:52.553 --> 06:54.764
Are they... friendly spirits?

06:54.834 --> 06:56.836
I guess we should go find out.

07:56.872 --> 07:58.915
Hello. I'm Daniel Jackson.

08:06.952 --> 08:09.206
Try smiling.

08:19.752 --> 08:21.963
This is bizarre.

08:26.752 --> 08:28.754
Uh, Daniel...

08:37.432 --> 08:39.143
Keep smiling. Don't move.

08:40.272 --> 08:43.067
- I am not fond of this.
- Me neither.

08:43.111 --> 08:45.865
They just wanna see what we feel like.

08:49.750 --> 08:51.754
Oh, hey! Wait!

08:51.831 --> 08:54.084
- What?
- One of them got my knife.

08:54.152 --> 08:56.153
I got it.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.673
Hey, there. Hi.

09:02.432 --> 09:05.143
That's not for you. It's very dangerous.

09:05.192 --> 09:06.943
Could I have it back, please?

09:10.110 --> 09:11.696
(Daniel sneezes)

09:11.792 --> 09:13.793
Agh!

09:25.591 --> 09:27.969
It's... It's just a sneeze.

09:28.030 --> 09:31.451
- Carter, how's your hand?
- It'll be all right, sir.

09:31.471 --> 09:34.140
I have never before
encountered such a species.

09:34.909 --> 09:37.455
I'm gonna try and communicate again.

09:37.510 --> 09:38.846
Want some company?

09:38.950 --> 09:41.620
I think it'll be less intimidating
if I go alone.

09:41.629 --> 09:44.299
All right. Find out what you can
about the UAV.

09:44.311 --> 09:46.312
OK.

10:22.509 --> 10:24.511
So...

10:29.070 --> 10:31.072
Daniel.

10:36.509 --> 10:39.221
You don't...
You don't speak at all, do you?

10:44.588 --> 10:46.883
OK.

11:33.548 --> 11:35.551
Thank you.

11:50.427 --> 11:53.432
You gotta wonder what
they're talking about in there.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.471
(Daniel imitates the UAV motor)

12:15.109 --> 12:18.821
Well, they're not naked.
They're covered with something.

12:18.827 --> 12:23.875
Look. It's some sort of body paint that
hardens into a second skin when it dries.

12:24.988 --> 12:28.658
I have to admit this is one of
the stranger cultures I've ever seen.

12:28.668 --> 12:30.961
As far as I can tell, they're communal...

12:31.028 --> 12:33.947
but there's little sign
of social communication.

12:33.988 --> 12:37.533
I haven't seen any tools
or signs of a functional civilisation.

12:37.547 --> 12:40.509
So they're a little less evolved
than we are.

12:40.548 --> 12:44.134
Well, we don't wanna jump
to any conclusions. Remember the Nox.

12:44.148 --> 12:46.900
And they did build these... homes.

12:46.947 --> 12:48.908
That's a kind appraisal.

12:51.386 --> 12:52.639
What about the UAV?

12:52.748 --> 12:56.706
I've tried everything I know
about rudimentary communication.

12:56.706 --> 13:00.921
And, to be honest, I've had
more successful conversations with dogs.

13:02.427 --> 13:03.427
So?

13:03.508 --> 13:07.178
So they're probably
a little less evolved than we are.

13:18.347 --> 13:19.515
Yes!

13:21.547 --> 13:22.798
Yes! The... the...

13:22.907 --> 13:24.951
The... the... Yes! Thank you.

13:25.027 --> 13:28.364
This... This is a major breakthrough.

13:30.586 --> 13:32.047
Atchoo!

13:32.787 --> 13:35.289
I'm sorry. This is, uh...

13:35.346 --> 13:37.140
This is nothing to worry about.

13:46.706 --> 13:48.709
Of course, I could be wrong.

13:54.626 --> 13:59.546
I can't find a pulse, but I don't know if
that means anything. He's still breathing.

13:59.546 --> 14:00.546
Captain...

14:01.625 --> 14:04.129
why don't we back off for now, huh?

14:05.746 --> 14:08.833
I really hope this isn't
because I sneezed on him.

14:08.865 --> 14:11.785
This one had lubricant
from the UAV on his hands.

14:11.826 --> 14:14.037
Perhaps that is what has made him ill.

14:14.105 --> 14:18.225
Could be their national pastime.
Maybe they got low blood sug...

14:18.226 --> 14:19.394
(tuneful wailing)

14:25.306 --> 14:27.975
- They're singing.
- Is that what that is?

14:28.025 --> 14:33.105
Some Native American as well as African
and Aboriginal tribes believe that...

14:33.105 --> 14:35.900
music and chants
have medicinal powers.

14:35.946 --> 14:37.947
The sound is incredible.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.796
Well, I guess it didn't work
quite like they hoped.

15:08.304 --> 15:11.558
O'Neill, should we not leave now?

15:12.905 --> 15:14.323
What?

15:14.426 --> 15:18.544
- Our presence may make them ill.
- I was wondering the same thing, Daniel.

15:18.546 --> 15:20.548
What if we're causing this?

15:20.624 --> 15:23.376
Look at them.
They don't know what's happening...

15:23.424 --> 15:25.635
much less how to help themselves.

15:25.705 --> 15:28.875
We don't even know what's happening,
much less how to help them.

15:32.346 --> 15:34.514
Well, whatever it is, it's...

15:34.585 --> 15:36.754
turning into an epidemic.

15:45.504 --> 15:47.506
Now, this is a house call.

15:47.585 --> 15:49.044
Let's go.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.985
Straight away, boys.

16:05.943 --> 16:07.947
- Captain Carter.
- Dr Fraiser.

16:08.024 --> 16:10.735
- What's the situation?
- We're up to 14 afflicted.

16:10.784 --> 16:15.063
They seem to just double over in pain
and pass out. They remain unconscious.

16:15.065 --> 16:19.384
We've introduced a number of foreign
substances that could be responsible.

16:19.384 --> 16:21.928
(Fraiser) OK. Let's set up over here.

16:21.985 --> 16:25.943
And the UAV ran into that...
plant thing I showed you.

16:25.943 --> 16:29.322
I've been sneezing like crazy
ever since we got here.

16:29.344 --> 16:32.431
I cut my hand. They could have
come in contact with my blood.

16:32.463 --> 16:34.758
One had lubricant
from the UAV on his hands.

16:34.823 --> 16:38.369
OK, look, the fact is,
it could be somebody's aftershave.

16:38.384 --> 16:41.136
How are they gonna react
if I wanna run some tests?

16:41.182 --> 16:44.895
The behaviour of the group
indicates serious agitation and concern.

16:44.904 --> 16:47.032
This is obviously unusual to them.

16:47.104 --> 16:52.235
They're worried, but they've been very
passive and willing to let us try to help.

16:56.384 --> 16:59.177
- Your tests are all clean.
- What about them?

16:59.222 --> 17:02.601
I'm pretty limited here.
They may look similar to us...

17:02.623 --> 17:05.125
but they are definitely very different.

17:05.182 --> 17:07.602
- You don't know what's wrong, do you?
- No.

17:08.863 --> 17:12.034
If we take one back to Earth,
I can run more extensive tests.

17:12.063 --> 17:14.775
Under Level Two quarantine,
it should be safe.

17:15.781 --> 17:17.785
- I'd like to stay.
- What for?

17:17.863 --> 17:21.491
Keep trying to communicate.
Reassure them we're trying to help.

17:22.262 --> 17:24.266
I don't see any danger, sir.

17:25.022 --> 17:27.818
We're not making things worse
by being here?

17:27.864 --> 17:29.865
The damage is probably already done.

17:29.942 --> 17:33.822
Quarantine the sick, in case
this problem is contagious amongst them.

17:33.823 --> 17:36.284
Check out the other villages
in the distance.

17:36.344 --> 17:40.140
If this illness is present there,
it just may rule us out as the origin.

17:42.063 --> 17:43.314
OK.

17:43.423 --> 17:45.509
Carter, you go back with Fraiser.

17:45.583 --> 17:49.045
Report to General Hammond,
and get your hand looked at.

17:49.063 --> 17:52.066
Daniel, Teal'c and I'll stick around.

17:59.942 --> 18:02.613
(Stargate gurgles)

18:15.422 --> 18:17.424
It's OK.

18:25.261 --> 18:27.263
Everything's gonna be fine.

19:00.980 --> 19:03.275
- On three.
- All right. You're gonna be OK.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.344
Get this out of here.

19:07.941 --> 19:10.818
Give me your stethoscope
when you're done.

19:10.861 --> 19:13.614
When he got sick,
they all gathered around him...

19:13.662 --> 19:17.708
and started making
this incredible sound. It was like music.

19:25.221 --> 19:29.351
- Do you not believe we are responsible?
- Yes, I believe we are...

19:30.141 --> 19:32.143
not.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.586
We should check it out either way.

19:35.661 --> 19:40.460
(Teal'c) It is possible an alien went
to warn others, and spread the disease.

19:40.460 --> 19:42.462
(O'Neill) Yeah. I guess.

19:42.540 --> 19:44.500
Whoa!

19:44.580 --> 19:46.583
I got it.

19:46.661 --> 19:49.122
- Are you all right, O'Neill?
- I'm fine.

19:51.621 --> 19:53.623
Look...

19:54.461 --> 19:57.339
Teal'c, I know
this might be tough for you...

19:57.380 --> 20:02.420
but do you mind if we just walked
without talking for a while?

20:02.421 --> 20:04.757
Do you feel an illness?

20:06.300 --> 20:08.720
A little headache. I'll be fine.

20:18.299 --> 20:21.010
- How's it going?
- Nothing conclusive yet.

20:21.058 --> 20:26.105
I'm gonna do an ultrasound to see if I can
get a clear picture of their internal organs.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.117
(high-pitched wailing)

20:36.099 --> 20:38.102
Maybe I'll try another way.

20:51.740 --> 20:55.286
(Fraiser) There are a number of
common elements in their blood.

20:55.298 --> 20:57.634
Red and white cells, glucose, protein.

20:57.700 --> 21:00.744
But you're working
with a human frame of reference.

21:00.778 --> 21:04.700
Exactly. How am I supposed to know
what's normal for these guys?

21:05.539 --> 21:08.250
(machine bleeps and pulsates)

21:08.298 --> 21:10.259
Uh...

21:10.338 --> 21:12.423
That's not exactly normal, is it?

21:12.499 --> 21:15.877
(Fraiser) Not from any anatomy
I've learned. Look at this.

21:49.097 --> 21:51.099
Whoa!

21:59.419 --> 22:01.421
What... uh... what...

22:01.498 --> 22:03.500
What just happened?

22:05.818 --> 22:07.488
Right.

22:10.298 --> 22:12.300
Good impression.

22:12.377 --> 22:14.297
What's up?

22:14.378 --> 22:16.381
The plant. Or, at least, it was.

22:17.817 --> 22:18.986
What?

22:19.097 --> 22:21.224
It had grown to over six feet tall...

22:21.298 --> 22:24.969
and when I came up to it,
it just shrank back down into the ground.

22:27.699 --> 22:30.660
I'm gonna back up again,
see if it does it again.

22:38.298 --> 22:40.299
Witness if you will...

22:41.258 --> 22:42.675
squat.

22:43.857 --> 22:45.859
Well, you... You saw it too.

22:45.938 --> 22:47.940
See? Just...

22:48.017 --> 22:50.019
like that.

22:51.978 --> 22:54.730
Many aliens in nearby villages are ill.

22:58.778 --> 23:01.615
OK... What are we gonna do?

23:01.656 --> 23:04.617
- How should I know?
- Well, we need to do something.

23:04.656 --> 23:08.855
I agree with you. But I haven't had
the brilliant revelations you have had.

23:08.856 --> 23:13.057
Maybe you could try something better
than inappropriate sarcasm.

23:13.057 --> 23:15.434
You want sarcasm?

23:15.498 --> 23:17.500
Nice to meet you.

23:24.297 --> 23:26.633
What's he smiling at?

23:26.696 --> 23:30.201
He appears to be bothered by the tone
you have taken towards each other.

23:31.896 --> 23:33.732
As am I.

23:35.777 --> 23:40.175
Uh, Teal'c... Head back to the gate.
Get a message to General Hammond.

23:40.176 --> 23:42.346
Let him know what's going on here.

23:42.416 --> 23:44.294
And the two of you will be fine?

23:44.375 --> 23:45.961
Yeah. Yeah.

23:46.056 --> 23:47.557
We'll be OK.

23:47.656 --> 23:52.369
I'm gonna stick around and work on
this quarantine thing with plant-boy here.

24:26.096 --> 24:28.097
We just got a report from Teal'c.

24:28.175 --> 24:32.615
The sick now number over a hundred...
among the aliens that they could count.

24:32.615 --> 24:36.452
The disease does not appear to be local
to the village you encountered.

24:36.455 --> 24:39.960
The muscle that I've identified
as the alien's heart...

24:39.974 --> 24:42.394
is beating more and more erratically.

24:42.455 --> 24:44.750
So whatever he's got is going to kill him?

24:45.576 --> 24:48.788
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this one alive, sir.

24:48.815 --> 24:52.403
I'm afraid to administer drugs
because it could make him worse.

24:52.415 --> 24:54.835
Sir, if you don't mind,
what are you thinking?

24:54.895 --> 24:57.566
I am thinking
that the unfortunate reality is...

24:57.615 --> 25:00.326
that this scenario
was not totally unexpected.

25:01.855 --> 25:05.401
Actually, the surprising thing is
it hasn't happened more often.

25:05.415 --> 25:09.252
It may be because there are so many
humans from Earth on other planets...

25:09.256 --> 25:11.717
that most contagions
are already out there.

25:11.773 --> 25:13.192
Not in this case.

25:13.295 --> 25:16.048
There's only so much time
and so many resources...

25:16.095 --> 25:18.890
that this facility
can devote to this situation.

25:18.935 --> 25:22.773
- Sir, I didn't say it was hopeless.
- They didn't ask for this.

25:24.494 --> 25:27.164
They're clearly unable
to help themselves.

25:27.175 --> 25:30.012
We just can't keep
trampling through the galaxy...

25:30.056 --> 25:32.849
with no regard
for the damage that we can do.

25:32.894 --> 25:35.773
- Sir, we need more time.
- A lot more time.

25:37.575 --> 25:40.828
How much time you've got
is not up to me.

25:40.855 --> 25:42.356
Sir?

25:42.455 --> 25:44.875
You said it yourself, doctor.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.936
They are dying.

25:53.294 --> 25:56.298
(O'Neill) Ah-ah-ah. Get back.
Come on. Get back.

25:56.335 --> 25:59.380
Fine. Knock yourself out. Go ahead.

25:59.414 --> 26:01.584
Go play in the street.

26:01.654 --> 26:03.865
Don't forget your sun block.

26:03.933 --> 26:05.936
Why aren't you helping me?

26:06.013 --> 26:09.894
It's no use. They don't understand.
They wanna be with each other.

26:09.894 --> 26:12.397
We're not gonna stand around
doing nothing.

26:12.453 --> 26:16.166
- We're not doing nothing.
- You're video-taping a plant.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.845
Well, I think this might be important.

26:18.894 --> 26:21.814
I think you might be losing
what's left of your mind.

26:23.734 --> 26:25.737
What's that supposed to mean?

26:25.814 --> 26:30.292
It means that on a good day
you can be a little flaky.

26:30.294 --> 26:33.839
And on a good day you can be
a little ignorant and condescending.

26:33.853 --> 26:37.065
Not condescending.
You're obviously misreading...

26:37.093 --> 26:41.374
a basic philosophical difference
of opinion on how to handle a crisis.

26:41.374 --> 26:45.002
Please! We have a difference
of opinion on just about everything.

26:45.013 --> 26:48.518
- Give me an example.
- I don't know. Pick something.

26:48.534 --> 26:50.537
How about mythology?

26:50.614 --> 26:52.449
Rumours, lies, fairy tales.

26:52.534 --> 26:54.161
You see? See? See?

26:54.253 --> 26:59.253
See? Mythology is one of the primary
motivations for cultural development!

26:59.253 --> 27:01.923
What's that got to do with filming a plant?!

27:01.933 --> 27:03.059
Exactly!

27:03.173 --> 27:05.259
- What does that mean?!
- I don't know!

27:12.054 --> 27:14.057
OK.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.843
What was that?

27:15.933 --> 27:18.478
I don't know. I don't feel so good.

27:18.534 --> 27:20.827
I've got a headache.

27:20.893 --> 27:23.438
Maybe we're getting whatever they have.

27:46.892 --> 27:49.185
Getting worse?

27:49.252 --> 27:50.880
Yeah. Kinda.

27:57.892 --> 27:59.269
Hey, Teal'c.

28:03.731 --> 28:07.193
Dr Fraiser has had little success
in healing the alien.

28:07.212 --> 28:09.965
I think Daniel and I are
coming down with something.

28:13.571 --> 28:16.366
- How are you doing?
- I remain unaffected.

28:20.692 --> 28:24.404
I think we should probably go back
and get checked out, huh?

28:26.851 --> 28:28.854
I will remain.

28:33.692 --> 28:37.572
All right, Teal'c. If we're not back
in 12 hours, come on home.

28:42.332 --> 28:44.334
Would you do me a favour?

28:45.852 --> 28:48.813
Could you keep an eye
on this plant thing for me?

28:50.412 --> 28:53.457
I will keep both of my eyes on it,
Daniel Jackson.

28:58.251 --> 29:00.253
(Daniel) Thank you.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.294
Are you gonna make this?

29:25.010 --> 29:27.012
Come on.

29:28.172 --> 29:30.173
(Stargate alarm)

29:39.372 --> 29:41.124
Are you OK?

29:43.211 --> 29:45.547
We started to feel sick.

29:45.611 --> 29:47.238
What kind of sick?

29:48.170 --> 29:50.172
Headaches.

29:50.250 --> 29:52.252
Brutal headaches.

29:52.330 --> 29:54.584
But now I feel fine.

29:54.652 --> 29:58.072
- Colonel, are you OK?
- I'm feeling better, actually.

30:11.450 --> 30:13.619
- Listen, I, uh...
- No, no.

30:13.690 --> 30:15.692
Um...

30:15.770 --> 30:17.772
Sorry. You were gonna say?

30:19.010 --> 30:21.013
No, it's just that, uh...

30:22.529 --> 30:24.532
Well...

30:24.609 --> 30:26.613
- You know.
- No, I know.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.692
I know.

30:29.529 --> 30:31.950
- You know that I...
- I know.

30:33.530 --> 30:36.951
- It's obvious there's something...
wrong with us.

30:36.970 --> 30:40.307
- (both) Physically.
- Well, there's nothing wrong with you.

30:40.329 --> 30:41.373
What?

30:41.490 --> 30:44.702
I've run every test,
short of exploratory brain surgery.

30:44.729 --> 30:46.731
You are both in perfect health.

30:48.130 --> 30:49.298
Huh.

30:50.809 --> 30:52.979
Dr Fraiser to critical care, stat.

31:01.930 --> 31:03.515
He's flatlining!

31:03.608 --> 31:06.779
I'd defibrillate, but I don't know
what it'll do in this case.

31:06.809 --> 31:10.480
One milligram epinephrine.
Start a lidocaine IV. Go!

31:57.170 --> 31:59.172
(squelching)

32:02.048 --> 32:04.050
(Teal'c groans)

32:06.847 --> 32:09.601
(low droning)

32:17.808 --> 32:19.810
He's stable for now.

32:19.887 --> 32:24.184
If he's gonna die, shouldn't we
at least let him be with his own kind?

32:45.167 --> 32:47.171
What are you looking for?

32:47.247 --> 32:49.458
I don't know.

32:49.528 --> 32:51.529
Something. Anything.

33:01.208 --> 33:03.210
Daniel...

33:03.288 --> 33:07.207
we can't always expect things
to go the way we want them to.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.751
To go the way we want them to?

33:11.567 --> 33:14.237
I mean, one wrong move, one false step...

33:14.288 --> 33:17.375
and a whole fragile world
gets wiped out?

33:19.047 --> 33:21.842
We are killing
a whole race of people here!

33:21.886 --> 33:23.888
How can I not care?!

33:30.207 --> 33:32.210
What?

33:33.846 --> 33:35.848
My head hurts again.

33:49.487 --> 33:51.573
Well, your pupils look fine.

33:51.646 --> 33:54.525
This is the strangest thing.
I feel fine again.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.944
OK. So, then, when did this start?

33:57.008 --> 33:59.719
It was probably
while I was watching the...

34:02.886 --> 34:04.888
Excuse me.

34:08.885 --> 34:13.391
There has to be something the camera
recorded. Something we can't see.

34:16.007 --> 34:18.009
Or hear.

34:19.126 --> 34:21.128
Give me the tape.

34:36.364 --> 34:38.534
Carter, what are you doing?

34:38.606 --> 34:41.483
I'm looking for something
that we can't hear.

34:46.565 --> 34:48.735
Here. In the long amplitude waves.

34:48.804 --> 34:51.474
Isolating and amplifying.

34:51.525 --> 34:53.527
(low droning)

34:59.125 --> 35:02.253
This was under everything
you recorded with the camera.

35:02.286 --> 35:05.789
The sound was present the entire time.
We just couldn't hear it.

35:05.806 --> 35:08.182
It's kind of annoying.

35:09.286 --> 35:10.913
Why don't you turn it down?

35:11.005 --> 35:15.485
It's more than annoying. It's responsible
for the symptoms you were describing.

35:15.485 --> 35:16.903
It is?

35:17.005 --> 35:21.405
Long-term exposure to certain sounds
can cause serious physical side effects.

35:21.405 --> 35:24.199
Your headaches, nausea,
severe irritability.

35:24.244 --> 35:27.331
The longer you're exposed to it,
the worse it gets.

35:27.364 --> 35:30.911
I bet this is what interfered
with the remote control on the UAV.

35:30.925 --> 35:35.483
- So this is what's making the aliens sick?
- No. You felt better when you got back.

35:35.485 --> 35:37.862
But the alien just keeps getting worse.

35:37.925 --> 35:42.244
And the sound that was causing your
symptoms isn't here. Except on this tape.

35:42.244 --> 35:44.748
So this isn't
what's making the aliens sick?

35:44.804 --> 35:46.806
Colonel, incoming wormhole.

35:51.485 --> 35:53.487
(technician) SG-1 code verified.

35:53.563 --> 35:55.733
Open the iris.

36:14.724 --> 36:17.519
- You all right?
- My condition is improving.

36:17.565 --> 36:19.567
Sit down.

36:22.083 --> 36:24.586
I guess Jaffa aren't impervious after all.

36:24.644 --> 36:27.481
What has led you to that assumption?

36:27.523 --> 36:32.284
Well, there's... some kind
of bad sound on that planet.

36:32.284 --> 36:35.914
It's what made us sick.
It just took you longer to cave in.

36:35.923 --> 36:38.260
I believe the organism was attacking me.

36:38.324 --> 36:39.617
What organism?

36:39.724 --> 36:42.978
I made a discovery
while observing your plants.

36:43.003 --> 36:45.672
- You saw them grow?
- Indeed.

36:45.682 --> 36:48.103
I saw several of them rise.

36:48.164 --> 36:51.583
When I approached,
they retracted into the ground.

36:51.603 --> 36:54.190
I removed the dirt
from around the plants.

36:54.242 --> 36:56.746
It appears they are all connected.

36:56.804 --> 36:58.889
And you say it attacked you?

36:58.963 --> 37:02.134
As I drew near the organism,
I became disoriented.

37:02.164 --> 37:06.884
My head was overcome with great pain.
Movement became very difficult.

37:06.884 --> 37:08.885
That's it.

37:10.523 --> 37:12.943
What? Where are you going?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.405
Come on.

37:24.322 --> 37:27.242
Did we record audio
from the UAV's air run over PJ2-445?

37:27.282 --> 37:28.701
- Sure.
- Do you have a tape?

37:28.804 --> 37:32.722
- It's in the hard-drive data bank.
- Run an audio spectrum analysis...

37:32.722 --> 37:36.728
amplify the low end and replay it.
I think I know where you're going.

37:40.043 --> 37:42.128
Fast-forward to after the UAV crashed.

37:44.483 --> 37:47.570
When the UAV crashed on the plant,
the sound changed.

37:47.603 --> 37:49.896
The plant is making that sound?

37:49.963 --> 37:52.757
Sir, it's an alien organism
on another planet.

37:52.804 --> 37:53.804
Good point.

37:53.884 --> 37:56.846
We changed the sound
the organism naturally makes.

37:56.882 --> 38:01.641
- Why would the sound change?
- It's alive. We... hurt it.

38:01.641 --> 38:05.521
Maybe the aliens are affected by the
sound in different ways than you were.

38:05.523 --> 38:08.192
They could need the sound
to be at a certain frequency.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.244
For what reason?

38:09.362 --> 38:12.699
To live. They don't even have
the same internal organs as us.

38:12.722 --> 38:17.681
The ultrasound. Do you remember how
the alien reacted when I tried to do it?

38:17.682 --> 38:21.519
That organ that we couldn't identify
must be sound-sensitive.

38:26.842 --> 38:29.179
So this inaudible sound made you sick...

38:29.242 --> 38:31.952
but not in the same way
it affected the aliens?

38:32.001 --> 38:34.297
They need the sound to live...

38:34.362 --> 38:37.574
but we altered it by harming
the organism that makes the sound?

38:38.442 --> 38:40.443
Sounds right.

38:45.440 --> 38:47.443
His pulse is getting stronger.

38:50.242 --> 38:52.244
(tuneful wailing)

39:07.242 --> 39:09.954
Frequency emitters are operational, sir.

39:13.081 --> 39:14.500
Daniel...

39:14.601 --> 39:17.271
we should, uh,
we should get out of here.

39:17.320 --> 39:20.199
Well, don't you wanna stay
and see if it works?

39:20.240 --> 39:23.286
Yeah. But we can watch
from the ridge over there.

39:23.322 --> 39:26.284
I have a hunch,
and I think we might be in the way.

39:39.121 --> 39:41.123
(Daniel) Goodbye.

40:10.320 --> 40:13.617
- How much longer, do you think?
- I don't know.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.362
Care to let us in on this hunch?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.402
Not yet, sir.

40:22.199 --> 40:24.202
(tuneful wailing)

40:26.840 --> 40:29.094
There.

40:29.159 --> 40:31.579
The plants are growing.

40:40.079 --> 40:41.873
That was your hunch?

40:41.960 --> 40:46.079
I sensed a symbiotic relationship
between the aliens and the organism.

40:46.079 --> 40:49.958
- They probably don't even realise it.
- How did you realise it?

40:51.641 --> 40:54.143
Captain?

40:57.199 --> 40:59.202
I talk to my plants, OK?
