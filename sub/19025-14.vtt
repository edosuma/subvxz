00:01.959 --> 00:03.583
(J.D.) <i>As a doctor,</i>
<i>there are certain procedures</i>

00:03.667 --> 00:04.750
<i>you just have a gift for.</i>

00:04.834 --> 00:07.250
Oh, that feels so good. Right there, yes.

00:08.125 --> 00:10.917
-Let's have your other foot.
-No! Ah-heh!

00:11.000 --> 00:14.000
It's just that there's something wrong
with my left foot.

00:15.041 --> 00:17.542
You guys would think
it's really disgusting.

00:17.625 --> 00:21.542
-We're doctors.
-Elliot. I'm a surgeon. I cut people open.

00:21.625 --> 00:26.417
Okay, okay. I have a huge bunion.

00:26.500 --> 00:29.667
(both groans)

00:30.000 --> 00:32.792
Sean's coming back in, like, a few weeks.
What am I supposed to do?

00:32.875 --> 00:35.750
Well, I think the obvious answer
is to draw Sean's face on it

00:35.834 --> 00:37.667
and tell him you grew it
because you missed him.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.583
Or it's a simple surgery.

00:40.667 --> 00:43.917
Ah, Turk, I think we've already decided
on bunion face.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.458
-Cut me the hell up.
-Damn it.

00:48.542 --> 00:49.959
Thanks, Nurse Espinoza.

00:50.375 --> 00:51.208
-Turk?
-Hmm?

00:51.792 --> 00:53.917
If I decide to keep my last name
after we get married,

00:54.000 --> 00:55.041
that's no big deal, right?

00:55.125 --> 00:56.458
Of course not, baby.

00:56.542 --> 00:58.208
We'll just have one
of those modern marriages

00:58.291 --> 01:00.000
where the husband and wife
don't love each other.

01:01.166 --> 01:03.333
Turk... wait! Turk!

01:03.417 --> 01:04.750
Turk... Whoa!

01:04.834 --> 01:05.834
(thuds)

01:05.917 --> 01:06.917
You okay?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.125
(Carla) All good.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.166
It's Jack's first birthday.
I want it to be special.

01:11.250 --> 01:12.750
I got a petting zoo for the kids,

01:12.834 --> 01:14.750
and we need to figure out
something great for the adults.

01:14.834 --> 01:16.208
How about a Russian roulette booth?

01:16.291 --> 01:17.667
And here's the kicker:

01:17.750 --> 01:19.834
We put bullets in all the chambers.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.875
-That way, everybody wins.
-Will there be a piñata?

01:22.959 --> 01:24.875
Because I need to know
if I should bring my pinata helmet.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.792
Hu-buh-buh! Would you zip it, nerd?

01:26.875 --> 01:28.000
The only reason I invited you

01:28.083 --> 01:32.000
is for some reason, you have your own
Spongebob Squarepants costume.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.625
It was a gift.

01:33.709 --> 01:35.542
<i>From me to me.</i>

01:36.125 --> 01:39.375
Anyhoo, I'm thinking
that probably you shouldn't come.

01:39.458 --> 01:42.458
-Why not?
-Because her whole family is in town.

01:43.458 --> 01:44.667
Hi, J.D.

01:44.750 --> 01:47.834
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my God. What do you say</i>
<i>to a girl you dumped 3 weeks ago?</i>

01:47.917 --> 01:49.709
I destroyed that videotape we made.

01:50.291 --> 01:51.583
What tape?

01:54.333 --> 01:55.166
Oh!

01:57.500 --> 02:00.750
Danni, if you don't act concerned,
no one at<i> America's Funniest Home Videos</i>

02:00.834 --> 02:01.917
is gonna think this is real.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.166
Can't we just go home and have sex?

02:04.250 --> 02:05.875
No! Again, from the top!

02:06.000 --> 02:07.000
Oh...

02:07.917 --> 02:09.834
Now, I'll never meet Bob Saget.

02:10.750 --> 02:11.583
Oh.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.291
So is their brother Ben
coming in for this thing, too?

02:17.375 --> 02:19.709
Oh, yeah. He always has to make
some grand entrance,

02:19.792 --> 02:21.959
then he just winds up depressed
afterwards.

02:22.041 --> 02:22.875
Why is that?

02:22.959 --> 02:24.625
(Ben) Rah! Aah!

02:25.709 --> 02:27.166
Because he never surprises us.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.291
-Not even a little bit?
-No. No.

02:28.375 --> 02:30.750
-(J.D. moans)
-Ooh... bloody.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.417
That's good.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.750
Now, this time,
try and do it with your head

02:34.834 --> 02:36.875
in sort of a less jarring position.

02:36.959 --> 02:38.834
-(J.D.) I can't!
-Oh, that's perfect.

02:38.917 --> 02:42.500
<i>♪ I can't do this all on my own ♪</i>

02:42.583 --> 02:45.792
<i>♪ No, I know I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:49.208 --> 02:50.834
<i>♪ I'm no Superman ♪</i>

02:52.750 --> 02:54.000
(Ben chirping)
Look at me.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.375
(High voice)
I'm a prickly pear.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.458
<i>♪ Dee Dee Dee Dee Dee-Dee ♪</i>

02:57.542 --> 02:59.709
-Ow! Ow! Ow!
-(J.D.) May I, for one second?

02:59.792 --> 03:00.959
Thanks.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.083
Rrrr!

03:04.000 --> 03:05.959
Rrrrr!

03:06.542 --> 03:08.750
Not a strong moment for you, Polly.

03:08.834 --> 03:11.875
I need to get it started first. Rrrr!

03:11.959 --> 03:16.208
So, you still doing that whole "kooky guy
who brings his camera everywhere" thing?

03:16.291 --> 03:18.291
-Till the day I die.
-Eh-heh.

03:18.375 --> 03:20.125
Is this thing made of Teflon?

03:20.208 --> 03:21.750
You know something?

03:22.208 --> 03:24.542
You have slept with both of my sisters,

03:24.625 --> 03:28.291
so that means that you and I
have something in common.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.041
Eh heh heh heh.

03:30.125 --> 03:31.333
Heh...

03:32.041 --> 03:33.166
I should get goin'.

03:35.333 --> 03:37.500
-Too weird?
-Nah!

03:37.583 --> 03:40.500
What's weird is that
it's taken my best friend so long

03:40.583 --> 03:41.625
to come and see my son.

03:41.709 --> 03:44.709
I mean, you get diagnosed with leukemia
and then you disappear for 2 years.

03:44.792 --> 03:45.750
What is that about?

03:45.834 --> 03:48.375
Well, it went into remission,
and I wanted to go out and see the world

03:48.458 --> 03:50.750
for all its splendor and glory.

03:50.834 --> 03:51.917
How'd that go for ya?

03:52.000 --> 03:55.083
Eh! I have some good pictures, though.
Yeah? Wanna see?

03:55.166 --> 03:57.792
Look, here's me
at the Great Wall of China.

03:58.709 --> 04:01.250
This is me... at the pyramids,

04:01.333 --> 04:03.458
And this... When is this? Oh, yeah.

04:03.542 --> 04:05.333
This was you and me, like, 8 seconds ago.

04:06.000 --> 04:09.750
So, Jordan tells me that while you were
out on your world leukemia tour,

04:09.834 --> 04:12.375
you neglected to visit
a single doctor, medicine man,

04:12.458 --> 04:15.000
or scary shaman
with the giant saucers in his ears.

04:15.083 --> 04:15.875
Pssst!

04:16.792 --> 04:17.875
(whispers loudly)
Bad!

04:17.959 --> 04:23.000
Turns out cancer is the kind of ailment
that you occasionally want to check up on.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.917
Fine. I'll get the exam.

04:26.417 --> 04:27.250
Tell you what.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.542
I missed the hell out of you. I did.

04:30.625 --> 04:31.792
Well, thanks, Perry.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.959
No. I missed you, too.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.542
(romantic music playing)

04:41.291 --> 04:43.583
-Ha ha ho ho!
-Yes!

04:43.667 --> 04:46.417
I am the king of gay chicken.

04:46.917 --> 04:48.583
God save me.

04:52.583 --> 04:55.333
You know, Elliot, you're eventually
gonna have to take off your sock.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.250
If I do, then from now on,
whenever you guys look at me,

04:57.333 --> 04:58.834
all you're gonna think
is "giant gross foot."

04:59.583 --> 05:01.959
It's like that security guard
with the hook for the hand.

05:02.041 --> 05:05.041
All anybody thinks when they look at him
is big, giant afro.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.792
(gasp)
I do think that.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.875
Okay, you know what?
Maybe it would be better

05:08.959 --> 05:11.041
if you focused
on how you're doing this for Sean.

05:11.125 --> 05:13.709
I mean, if there was something
about me physically

05:13.792 --> 05:17.041
that bothered Carla,
I would be excited to fix it for her.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.875
I mean, it'd probably make our
relationship even better and more--

05:19.959 --> 05:20.792
I hate your mole.

05:20.875 --> 05:21.709
-What?
-What?

05:23.417 --> 05:24.417
Baby...

05:24.500 --> 05:27.834
You said it was your tickle button.
You made me shave my moustache.

05:27.917 --> 05:30.250
That was before I knew
what was under there.

05:30.333 --> 05:31.291
(gasps)

05:31.375 --> 05:35.291
(shaver whirring)

05:38.250 --> 05:39.792
Oh! Damn.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.333
A brother finally can breathe.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.417
Hello, there.

05:49.500 --> 05:52.000
You want to quit, then quit!

05:52.083 --> 05:56.625
But you, sir, are a worthless peon,
and you always will be a worthless peon!

05:58.125 --> 06:00.917
Sir, you know my band,
the Worthless Peons?

06:01.000 --> 06:04.125
Well, Cris from shipping
and receiving wants to go solo.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.709
We lose him, we lose our sex appeal.

06:06.792 --> 06:08.166
He's the only one with hair.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.792
What do you think I should do?

06:09.875 --> 06:12.458
Ted, you know my rule
about personal problems.

06:12.542 --> 06:15.458
I'm not interested
unless it involves my loved ones

06:15.542 --> 06:17.500
or possibly my wife.

06:17.583 --> 06:19.125
Do lawyer stuff to that.

06:19.208 --> 06:20.250
(camera shutter clicks)

06:21.709 --> 06:24.875
Awwwww! Let me powder my head first.

06:24.959 --> 06:27.750
So, should I be worried
about the old ticker?

06:27.834 --> 06:30.208
Oh, Mr. Taylor,
let me worry about that for you.

06:30.291 --> 06:32.208
(J.D.) <i>Oh, my God, he's gonna die.</i>

06:32.291 --> 06:34.500
Oh, newbie, perfect timing.

06:34.583 --> 06:37.125
I have to run $150
down to the police station

06:37.208 --> 06:39.250
because Mr. Jinky the juggler,

06:39.333 --> 06:42.125
who Jordan just has to have
for Jack's birthday party,

06:42.208 --> 06:44.125
-just got a DUI.
-Yeah.

06:44.208 --> 06:45.959
Only me. Long story short,

06:46.041 --> 06:48.959
your new job is to take young Ben here
by the hand

06:49.041 --> 06:51.917
and run every hematological screening test
we have.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.125
Dr. Cox, I can't.
I'm already covering for Doug.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.917
He's on a his-and-hers spa day
with his mom.

06:56.000 --> 06:56.875
-What?
-What?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.750
Don't ask. The point is, I'm swamped,

06:58.834 --> 07:01.166
and I'm a little worried
about Mr. Taylor here.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.917
-Ah...
-Taylor.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.834
For the life of me, I can't figure out
his irregular heartbeat.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.000
I already looked at his EKG, newbie,

07:08.083 --> 07:11.208
and, trust me,
he's not gonna die in the next 30 minutes.

07:11.709 --> 07:12.542
Now...

07:12.625 --> 07:14.792
go!

07:14.875 --> 07:20.458
Hey, J.D., my sister Danni is more
of a gentle kisser, don't you think?

07:20.542 --> 07:23.792
Whereas Jordan
is a little bit more along the lines

07:23.875 --> 07:25.417
of teeth and tongue.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.166
Will you please stop?

07:27.250 --> 07:28.792
Fangs. Ahh!

07:30.125 --> 07:33.166
This guy is supposed to be
a great plastic surgeon.

07:34.125 --> 07:36.166
Oh... okay.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.166
So, who wants what bigger or smaller?

07:39.250 --> 07:42.083
My fiancé would like
to have his mole removed.

07:42.166 --> 07:44.750
That? That's cute.
It's like a tickle button.

07:44.834 --> 07:47.250
No, it's not. It needs to go away.

07:47.917 --> 07:50.667
All right, I'll scrape it away, and we'll
cover the area with skin we'll graft

07:50.750 --> 07:52.000
from the backside of your upper thigh.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.208
So you'd be a butt face.

07:54.291 --> 07:55.834
That'd be a funny nickname.

07:55.917 --> 07:57.000
-No, it wouldn't.
-Yes, it would.

07:57.083 --> 07:59.375
(loudly) God, how long does it take
to fill a bottle with pills?

08:00.500 --> 08:03.166
I'm sorry, madam.
I hope we didn't wake you.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.000
It's just that I have like 50 patients
that I...

08:05.083 --> 08:07.417
(pager beeps)

08:07.750 --> 08:08.583
That's a code.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.375
Watch. I'm gonna get out
of this mole thing.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.583
-Whatever, butt face.
-Uncool.

08:16.875 --> 08:21.417
Sir, I think I figured out how my problem
affects one of your loved ones.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.750
It affects<i> me?</i>

08:23.834 --> 08:24.709
Swing and a miss.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.542
Oh, thank God you're here.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.291
I totally need someone to talk to.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.291
Usually, I would talk to Dr. Cox,
but he's out doing stuff,

08:34.375 --> 08:36.667
and, of course, there's always Laverne,
but I'm kind of her boss

08:36.750 --> 08:38.917
and I'd like to avoid
getting too up close and personal

08:39.000 --> 08:40.250
with staff members who work below me.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.500
As do I.

08:41.583 --> 08:44.333
See, it's just that I told Turk
I didn't like his mole

08:44.417 --> 08:45.709
and I feel guilty now.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.500
Have you seen it?
I mean, you can't avoid it.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.208
Dr. Cox, uh...

08:55.291 --> 08:57.834
I'm afraid my band lost a member,

08:57.917 --> 09:01.834
so we're not going to be able to perform
at your son's party.

09:01.917 --> 09:07.083
Ted, now even though I never asked you to,
that is still just "teh-rriffic" news.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.250
That hurt here and here.

09:13.625 --> 09:14.709
Dr. Cox?

09:15.291 --> 09:16.583
What's the matter with you there, Sheila?

09:16.667 --> 09:18.333
You look like Maybelline
just went belly up.

09:18.417 --> 09:21.333
20 minutes after you left,
he went into cardiac arrest.

09:23.667 --> 09:25.750
We tried to resuscitate him,
but there was nothing we could do.

09:28.917 --> 09:29.750
I'm sorry.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.166
Oh, man, bummer.

09:33.667 --> 09:34.875
This shouldn't have happened.

09:34.959 --> 09:38.083
(J.D.) <i>Guilt's a funny thing.</i>
<i>It can lead to denial.</i>

09:38.166 --> 09:39.000
The kid screwed up.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.792
No, he didn't. He told you,
he has way too many patients.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.792
He's swamped.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.750
The kid screwed up.

09:46.375 --> 09:47.208
Okay.

09:47.667 --> 09:48.667
Darn kid!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.667
(J.D.) <i>And guilt can lead to compromise.</i>

09:51.875 --> 09:55.166
Turk is doing this sweet thing for me,
you know?

09:55.250 --> 09:57.750
-(Dr. Kelso) And...
-(men) Hey! Whoa! Hey!

09:57.834 --> 10:00.625
I just wish there was something
I could do for him.

10:01.625 --> 10:02.792
You know what, sweetie?

10:03.625 --> 10:05.542
I'm fine with getting rid of this mole,

10:06.166 --> 10:08.667
but you've got to be willing to take
my last name when we get married.

10:08.750 --> 10:11.667
That's perfect. Of course I will.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.250
(Carla giggles)

10:14.542 --> 10:15.959
And there she goes...

10:16.041 --> 10:17.417
Mrs. Carla butt face.

10:19.166 --> 10:20.125
Damn it.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.542
(J.D.) <i>But as a doctor,</i>
<i>you're around death so much</i>

10:22.625 --> 10:23.834
<i>that you get used to the guilt</i>

10:24.250 --> 10:27.000
<i>and you learn how to keep it from</i>
<i>affecting your personal relationships.</i>

10:27.709 --> 10:28.709
Brace yourself.

10:28.792 --> 10:30.125
What are you still doin' here?

10:30.750 --> 10:31.750
I'm on call tonight.

10:31.834 --> 10:32.750
Not anymore.

10:33.458 --> 10:34.709
I'm takin' all your patients.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.709
So, wait. You think this was my fault?

10:36.792 --> 10:39.208
Hey, this is an emotional situation.

10:39.291 --> 10:40.792
So why don't you just go easy on the kid?

10:40.875 --> 10:43.333
It was your fault. Now, get the hell out.

10:45.583 --> 10:47.500
Well, that was good.
That was good listening.

10:47.583 --> 10:48.750
-Thank you.
-Yep.

10:56.959 --> 10:58.667
Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.

10:58.750 --> 11:00.709
Beep, beep, beep. Beep, beep, beep.

11:00.792 --> 11:02.083
-Beep, beep, beep.
-I got it.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.250
I got... I got it.

11:04.375 --> 11:06.208
-All the best.
-Thanks, man.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.083
I'll tell you what.
Nothin' says good mornin'

11:09.166 --> 11:10.750
like a drunken human alarm clock.

11:10.834 --> 11:11.667
(yawns)

11:11.750 --> 11:15.208
Hey, you've been here
for 60 straight hours.

11:15.291 --> 11:16.500
You need to go home.

11:16.583 --> 11:17.959
You know what I need?

11:18.333 --> 11:21.041
I need people to stop telling me
what I should do.

11:21.834 --> 11:22.667
Fine.

11:23.709 --> 11:26.625
-You know what you should do?
-Oh... why are you here?

11:26.709 --> 11:29.125
Dr. Cox, can I talk to you for a second?

11:29.208 --> 11:32.750
Hey, Val, you know what's funny?

11:32.834 --> 11:35.500
Ever since I started
taking care of your patients,

11:35.583 --> 11:37.208
not one of them has died.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.166
Look, you want to be mad at me,
that's fine.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.208
I get it, okay? But Jordan called.

11:42.291 --> 11:43.834
She wants to make sure
you show this afternoon.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.417
Ooh, right, that thing. Yeah.
Put us down for Ben plus one.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.750
I'm not goin' anywhere, so beat it.

11:52.041 --> 11:53.750
You guys, I don't want to do this.

11:53.834 --> 11:55.959
Oh, come on,
no one's gonna call you names.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.458
-I know, but--
-Face!

11:57.542 --> 11:59.500
-(chuckles)
-Butt face.

11:59.583 --> 12:02.375
Listen. My butt is fabulous.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.542
A slice of that up here,
see, that's just me spreadin' the wealth.

12:06.458 --> 12:08.208
Still, my mole is a part of my identity,

12:08.291 --> 12:10.834
and I need you guys to convince Carla
to get me out of this.

12:10.917 --> 12:12.542
I can't, man. I got things to do.

12:12.625 --> 12:15.250
Like what? Dr. Cox took all your patients.

12:21.625 --> 12:23.000
-Gin.
-Damn it.

12:26.750 --> 12:27.625
Nice hand.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.333
I meant the cards.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.166
I gotta win my money back from Leonard.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.834
You know, the guy with the giant afro?

12:36.917 --> 12:38.750
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh. Right. Yeah.

12:38.834 --> 12:39.959
Uh-huh.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.000
-Look, I'll go talk to her for you.
-Thank you.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.250
I hate her for doing this to me.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.041
I hate him for doing this to me.

12:47.917 --> 12:51.458
I don't think he understands
that Espinoza is more than a name to me.

12:51.542 --> 12:52.709
It's my heritage.

12:53.166 --> 12:54.792
It's also a candy bar in Ecuador,

12:54.875 --> 12:57.083
but, mostly, it's my heritage.

12:57.166 --> 13:00.750
I just don't want to do this, Dr. Kelso,
but I already agreed.

13:01.417 --> 13:02.709
What do you think I should do?

13:03.291 --> 13:06.792
Well, nurse snickers,
until now you've just been white noise,

13:06.875 --> 13:08.250
but since you've forced me to respond,

13:08.333 --> 13:10.959
let me tell you a couple of things
that only a few people know.

13:12.750 --> 13:16.083
I haven't paid my country club dues
since the third quarter of '97,

13:16.166 --> 13:18.583
but I still tee off
every Wednesday at 8:15

13:18.667 --> 13:21.250
and take a bare-ass steam
when the last putt drops.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.250
But more importantly,

13:23.333 --> 13:27.750
I really don't care
about any of you or your problems,

13:27.834 --> 13:29.542
and you can confirm that with Ted.

13:31.875 --> 13:34.291
Don't those Espinozas have nougat?

13:37.125 --> 13:38.166
-Can we go now?
-No.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.625
-How about now?
-No. Look, as a rule of thumb,

13:40.709 --> 13:42.417
I don't attend parties
where the guest of honor

13:42.500 --> 13:43.583
has no idea what's goin' on.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.041
That's not true. You remember back
when you and Jordan first got married

13:46.125 --> 13:49.583
and we went to senile old Grandpa Morty's
95th birthday party?

13:49.667 --> 13:51.417
And you remember the one
where he kept trying to get

13:51.500 --> 13:54.083
the coat check girl thrown out
'cause she was loyal to the Kaiser?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.917
Benji, I appreciate your concern,
but you don't understand.

13:57.417 --> 14:00.250
-What don't I understand?
-Well, do you see all these people here?

14:00.333 --> 14:03.000
This is not some kind of senior citizen
slumber party.

14:03.083 --> 14:05.500
I mean, if it was,
I'd have already put Mr. Fordham's hand

14:05.583 --> 14:07.041
in a nice bowl of warm water.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.125
But, God bless him, he's gonna go ahead
and wet the bed anyway.

14:10.208 --> 14:14.583
My point is that if I'm not here,
people die.

14:14.667 --> 14:17.083
(dramatic)
"If I'm not here, people die."

14:17.166 --> 14:18.917
Oh, come on.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.333
Listen, why don't you just let me take
this little mental breakdown of yours,

14:25.417 --> 14:28.542
and I'm gonna put it
right here in my pocket,

14:28.625 --> 14:30.917
and then that way,
you can piss off for the afternoon

14:31.000 --> 14:32.667
and you can let one
of the other 9,000 other doctors

14:32.750 --> 14:34.041
take care of things around here for you.

14:34.125 --> 14:37.959
So you haven't noticed that
my supporting cast in this theater of hell

14:38.041 --> 14:40.417
is a veritable who's who
of incompetent puppets?

14:41.333 --> 14:42.583
So sorry to bother you, Dr. Cox,

14:42.667 --> 14:45.959
but I have searched
high and low for Carla,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.208
and, honestly,
it is like she has gone poof!

14:48.291 --> 14:50.583
And, like, disappeared into thin air.

14:51.667 --> 14:52.542
Have you seen her?

14:52.625 --> 14:54.875
(chuckles)
No.

14:56.417 --> 14:57.959
No, I haven't seen her.

14:58.041 --> 15:00.500
Well, if you do, um...

15:00.583 --> 15:01.458
page me.

15:02.250 --> 15:05.458
-Yuhh!
-Oh, Ben, outstanding commitment.

15:06.375 --> 15:09.000
Thanks. So... can we go now?

15:09.083 --> 15:11.041
Provided that gets you off my back.

15:11.792 --> 15:12.709
One more thing.

15:14.125 --> 15:15.959
Oh, my God. Come on.

15:21.458 --> 15:22.750
You've gotta forgive him.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.917
What? They're my shower shorts.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.125
Thanks again
for helping me look for Carla.

15:31.208 --> 15:33.041
No problem. I'll check the dumpster.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.500
Uh, we're not looking for dead Carla.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.542
Attagirl, you stay optimistic.

15:44.208 --> 15:45.375
(sniffling)

15:46.208 --> 15:48.166
Ahem. Sorry, sir.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.583
It's been an emotional couple of days.

15:52.208 --> 15:55.792
I'm just here to get a nasal speculum.

15:56.750 --> 15:59.458
I just wish I didn't hate
that mole so much.

16:00.458 --> 16:01.417
(sighs)

16:03.125 --> 16:05.333
I used one of these on my wife once.

16:06.417 --> 16:08.041
She's a terrible snorer.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.750
She used to keep me up all night.

16:09.834 --> 16:11.083
I made her have the surgery,

16:11.166 --> 16:12.792
but, of course,
that just made things worse.

16:13.375 --> 16:14.709
But here's the twist:

16:14.792 --> 16:17.291
Now, whenever she goes out of town,

16:17.375 --> 16:19.250
I can't fall asleep without the sound

16:19.333 --> 16:22.917
of that gasping,
wheezing woman lying right next to me.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.500
Trust me,
if I ever met a Japan Air stewardess

16:25.583 --> 16:28.000
who snored like Enid,
I'd marry her tomorrow.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.959
(laughs)

16:30.583 --> 16:31.458
Here's the point:

16:33.375 --> 16:36.000
You might find out
that thing you hate so much

16:36.834 --> 16:40.083
is the very same thing you'll miss
when it's gone.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.083
Thank you, sir.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.834
All right, I'm gonna get right to it.

16:53.917 --> 16:57.959
You tell Carla my mole is inoperable,
I will pay you $10,000.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.375
Turk, I don't want you to do this.

17:00.458 --> 17:01.417
The mole's inoperable.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.583
Deal's off.

17:02.667 --> 17:04.750
Turk, I couldn't find her.

17:04.834 --> 17:05.750
Don't sweat it.

17:05.834 --> 17:06.834
See you!

17:07.959 --> 17:11.375
Oh, great!
An open surgery slot just goin' to waste.

17:12.166 --> 17:13.625
Not necessarily.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.667
Look at this.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.875
-Oh!
-Ahh!

17:22.250 --> 17:23.542
(whams)

17:23.625 --> 17:24.458
Oh.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.166
Those are the most ridiculous things
I've ever seen.

17:28.250 --> 17:31.375
You know you're right.
I was an idiot to buy these shower shorts.

17:31.458 --> 17:34.250
I mean, it's not like they come
with a complimentary shower wallet.

17:34.333 --> 17:35.333
(whams)

17:35.417 --> 17:36.375
Ow.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.750
Look, I just wanted to say
that what happened,

17:40.625 --> 17:41.750
it wasn't your fault,

17:43.208 --> 17:44.333
and I'm sorry.

17:44.917 --> 17:45.750
Thanks.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.208
I really needed to hear that.

17:48.291 --> 17:49.250
Good.

17:50.291 --> 17:51.792
Come on. Let's get dressed and go.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.000
Shower shorts?

17:54.083 --> 17:58.375
For the man who has nothing to hide,
but still wants to.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.792
(J.D.) <i>Acceptance can take a lot</i>
<i>of different forms.</i>

18:05.041 --> 18:07.667
<i>Whether it's accepting that it's okay</i>
<i>to show your soft side</i>

18:07.750 --> 18:09.041
<i>every once in a while.</i>

18:09.125 --> 18:11.583
Well, it's official. Cris left the band.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.250
Well, Ted, you know what I think?

18:13.333 --> 18:15.917
Good riddance to him.
You'll find another tenor.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.250
Thank you, sir.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.834
And if you don't, who cares?
You all stink anyway.

18:25.417 --> 18:28.166
(J.D.) <i>Or accepting someone you love</i>
<i>just the way they are.</i>

18:28.250 --> 18:30.500
Can you tie my tie, Mrs. Espinoza?

18:33.375 --> 18:34.333
Answer him!

18:41.667 --> 18:43.917
(chuckling)

18:44.000 --> 18:46.250
-You just kissed my mole.
-Mm-hmm.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.375
So how come you don't have
to get all dressed up?

18:49.458 --> 18:51.250
I am dressed up.
Do you see any holes in these pants?

18:51.333 --> 18:52.250
No.

18:52.333 --> 18:53.250
I'm glad you made it.

18:53.959 --> 18:56.625
Listen, there's one more thing
you have to do for me.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.834
You can't keep me from getting drunk.

18:59.959 --> 19:01.291
You have to forgive yourself

19:01.375 --> 19:02.834
for everything
that went down the other day.

19:02.917 --> 19:06.208
(chuckles)
You are so annoying.

19:06.291 --> 19:07.125
Eh...

19:09.500 --> 19:10.542
Okay.

19:10.625 --> 19:11.583
Good.

19:13.417 --> 19:17.000
Now, where's your camera? Aren't you...
Aren't you gonna take some pictures?

19:18.709 --> 19:19.667
Pictures of what?

19:19.750 --> 19:22.792
You know,
of crying babies covered in chocolate,

19:22.875 --> 19:26.166
people singin' <i>Happy Birthday </i>to my son
