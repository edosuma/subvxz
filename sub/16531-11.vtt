WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.537
ANNOUNCER: Thanks for
downloading this Fox show.

00:03.571 --> 00:05.739
And don't miss
all-new episodes on Fox.

00:07.608 --> 00:11.145
Previously on Empire...
LUCIOUS: Inferno is an album
I'm producing,

00:11.179 --> 00:12.846
and I'm hoping
that my son, Jamal,

00:12.880 --> 00:14.248
will bless me with a song.

00:14.282 --> 00:17.351
This is Lucious Lyon's
dear mama.

00:17.385 --> 00:20.188
LUCIOUS:
You know, this business
about my mama and the press--

00:20.221 --> 00:21.522
keep an eye on it.

00:21.555 --> 00:22.823
I'll keep her in my sight.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.192
HAKEEM:
Yo, Tory Ash.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.859
See y'all met my
crazy-ass friend Tory.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.496
Why did you leave rehab?
This is my rehab.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.331
TELLER:
So Lucious Lyon wins again.
He murdered Frank Gathers

00:30.364 --> 00:32.500
and I can prove it.
I just need more time.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.068
You're off the case
'cause it's closed.

00:34.102 --> 00:35.436
Your new head of A&R.

00:35.469 --> 00:37.671
Mrs. Anika Lyon.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.607
COOKIE: You built this company
on my back,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.609
and you just give it
to that bitch?!

00:41.642 --> 00:42.910
(shouts)

00:47.415 --> 00:50.418
(Mozart's "Sequentia Lacrimos"
from Requiem in D Minor plays)

01:01.262 --> 01:03.264
What have I done?

01:25.153 --> 01:27.155
*

01:55.983 --> 01:57.985
*

02:07.895 --> 02:09.096
Here you go.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.264
Thank you.

02:10.298 --> 02:11.299
You're welcome.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.004
I don't know what happened.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.339
Hmm.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.475
I mean, we were fighting, bad.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.311
Not bad enough.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.012
You didn't kill him.

02:25.045 --> 02:26.647
(chuckles)

02:26.680 --> 02:29.217
We were tussling...

02:29.250 --> 02:31.852
and...

02:31.885 --> 02:33.354
there's that thin line

02:33.387 --> 02:34.522
and we crossed it.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.557
I don't know why I kissed him.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.158
Because...

02:38.192 --> 02:39.927
you're addicted to that man.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.697
He was my first.

02:43.731 --> 02:45.533
Hmm.

02:45.566 --> 02:48.436
For over 20 years, the only.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.941
That night Daddy
kicked me out...

02:56.043 --> 02:58.346
Come on, babe.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.193
(sobbing)

03:17.765 --> 03:19.867
It's okay, it's okay.
You and me now, okay?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.068
(crying): No.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.003
It's okay.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.438
It's okay.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.076
I got us.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.146
Okay?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.721
Look, I... I know you've never

03:40.754 --> 03:41.922
done this before, okay?

03:41.955 --> 03:43.791
We don't have to, baby.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.125
We can wait.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.594
YOUNG COOKIE:
No, no, I want to.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.330
I need to... now.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.770
Just because
he was your first

03:56.804 --> 03:58.739
doesn't mean
he has to be your last.

04:01.074 --> 04:02.643
Do you love Angelo?

04:03.677 --> 04:05.379
I think so.
Think?

04:05.413 --> 04:07.047
I don't want to lose him,

04:07.080 --> 04:08.816
and that's why I have to come
clean about what happened.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.484
No, no, no, no, no.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.320
Nothing happened.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.322
You just went...

04:14.355 --> 04:15.489
Cookie crazy.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.425
Doesn't mean anything.

04:17.458 --> 04:21.329
Your future will not
be ruined again

04:21.362 --> 04:24.164
by the likes of that
damn Lucifer Lyon.

04:35.543 --> 04:36.877
(elevator dings)

04:40.047 --> 04:41.849
Oh, my God.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.584
What happened?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.754
LUCIOUS: Look at what they did
to my baby.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.457
They're still going through
the security footage.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.425
Thirsty might know
more about it.

04:51.459 --> 04:52.660
ANIKA: Okay, I'm gonna
go get caught up.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.194
Mm.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.929
Hey, Thirsty.
Nice to have you back.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.631
This is Marty.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.500
She's gonna be looking after
Granny Groove from now on.

04:59.533 --> 05:00.634
LEAH:
Oh, really?

05:00.668 --> 05:03.103
What are you? A boy?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.272
Or a girl?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.841
Mama, don't act like you fresh
out of the plastic. Behave.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.877
Look, um,

05:09.910 --> 05:11.211
how are they doing
on the scrubbing

05:11.244 --> 05:13.013
of some of that footage?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.982
Well, wax on, wax off,
like it never happened.

05:15.015 --> 05:17.385
LUCIOUS: Good, 'cause Cookie
and Jamal are coming after me

05:17.418 --> 05:19.319
with this little album
of theirs. I can't have

05:19.353 --> 05:21.288
any distractions from Inferno.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.391
THIRSTY:
Yeah, distractions are bad.

05:23.424 --> 05:24.458
LUCIOUS:
No, you can't.

05:24.492 --> 05:26.360
I have to go to the bathroom.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.128
THIRSTY:
Don't let her out of your sight.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.365
That means you got
to go to the bathroom.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.333
*

05:40.340 --> 05:42.342
* Baby, I, baby, I *

05:42.376 --> 05:44.344
* Can't decide, can't decide *

05:44.378 --> 05:48.015
* If you're just a memory *

05:48.048 --> 05:50.250
* We were amazing *

05:50.283 --> 05:52.553
* I was amazed
that we didn't make it *

05:52.586 --> 05:54.254
* We were amazing *

05:54.287 --> 05:56.524
* So, you still chasin'
and I can't take it *

05:56.557 --> 05:58.158
* Can't take the heat and *

05:58.191 --> 06:00.594
* I won't make it easy for you *

06:00.628 --> 06:03.163
* You got to prove it to me... *

06:03.196 --> 06:05.833
The one with the blonde hair,
Becky, what you think?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.735
I think it's your
directorial debut, Hakeem,

06:07.768 --> 06:10.438
so whatever you like.
Then she's in.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.040
* Show me why... *
We're done, right?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.443
Yeah, we're done. There's only
50 more dancers

06:15.476 --> 06:17.445
waiting to audition.
We're not done.

06:17.478 --> 06:20.113
Yeah, Keem, you can't
rush the process.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.215
This video is
for my next single.

06:22.249 --> 06:24.217
Baby, you're
the baddest, okay?

06:24.251 --> 06:25.385
What better way
for the world to see you

06:25.419 --> 06:27.020
than how I see you every day?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.556
Come here.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.525
* Show me why I should
go all in... *

06:31.559 --> 06:32.726
It's gonna be epic.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.595
I promise.

06:34.628 --> 06:38.265
After auditions, let's go to my
dad's and hang out with Bella.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.733
* Last time didn't pan out... *

06:39.767 --> 06:41.735
Hakeem, I told you
I'm not doing that.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.571
Your baby already
has a mother.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.439
I just want you
to get to know her.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.608
* I got tricks up my sleeves
in the lining in my cuff *

06:47.641 --> 06:49.477
* I'm-a keep on trying
till you budge *

06:49.510 --> 06:51.545
* Leaving everything up
to timing ain't enough. *

06:51.579 --> 06:52.813
(music stops)

06:52.846 --> 06:54.281
WOMAN: And five...

06:54.314 --> 06:55.382
Hakeem.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.951
What's your grandmother
doing here?

06:57.985 --> 06:59.887
WOMAN:
Now show me the floor routine.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
(chuckles)
Yes, let's all go up, go up.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.424
This can be the dance floor.

07:04.458 --> 07:05.926
Uh, hi, Ms. Walker.
How you doing?

07:05.959 --> 07:06.994
Hi.
Hey, Grandma.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.729
Hi, sweetie.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.799
Who's the little
ballerina in pink?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.734
Quintana.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.802
Come meet my granny.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.909
Quintana.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.611
Hi.
What a sweetie.

07:23.644 --> 07:26.313
Do you mind asking
that big individual

07:26.346 --> 07:28.115
over there
to hold this for me?

07:29.550 --> 07:30.684
Okay.

07:30.718 --> 07:31.952
And, Quintana,

07:31.985 --> 07:33.987
I want you to drop it.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.323
Then bend over to pick it up.
Grandma...

07:36.356 --> 07:39.660
To show Marty
how limber you are.

07:39.693 --> 07:43.497
This'll get me a feature
in this video, right?

07:44.665 --> 07:48.268
You make my granny happy,
why not?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.437
*

07:50.470 --> 07:52.706
Okay.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.276
LEAH:
How's Tiana?

07:56.309 --> 08:00.180
I want to talk to Bella's
future stepmama.

08:00.213 --> 08:02.482
Chill out, Grandma.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.785
Maybe you could help me get
her comfortable with Bella.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
Okay.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.925
Oops.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.228
Mm-hmm.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.639
TORY:
Who's that?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.240
Girl, that's Mamie Smith,
queen of the blues.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.542
What's wrong with you?

08:28.576 --> 08:29.543
Who's that?

08:29.577 --> 08:31.745
La Calavera Catrina.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.213
It's the death goddess.

08:33.246 --> 08:35.048
It's just a
good reminder

08:35.082 --> 08:37.350
about, you know,
mortality and sobriety.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.086
I hear you. You ready?

08:39.119 --> 08:41.321
Did you bring the cocaine?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.490
I'm kidding.
I hate you.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.592
(chuckles)

09:09.617 --> 09:11.919
* You take it down *

09:11.952 --> 09:14.588
* You take it down *

09:14.622 --> 09:16.624
* But it feels so bad *
* No, it hurts so bad *

09:16.657 --> 09:19.426
BOTH:
* But it feels so good... *

09:19.459 --> 09:20.861
(whoops)

09:20.894 --> 09:22.863
ANDRE: Now, these are
the two apartments

09:22.896 --> 09:24.364
we're looking at
this afternoon.

09:24.397 --> 09:27.367
Nice. Okay.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.037
Now, promise me you'll at
least get past the front door

09:30.070 --> 09:31.605
before you say no.
(laughs)

09:31.639 --> 09:33.641
I'm selective, sweetheart,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.943
which means you need to
be selective as well.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.410
Okay.
What's up, Andre?

09:37.444 --> 09:38.979
What's up?
Nessa.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.081
Hey.
What's up?

09:41.114 --> 09:44.051
H-Hey, Shine.
Yo.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.986
(softly):
Dain-Ja?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.387
Yeah, Andre said he wanted

09:47.420 --> 09:48.889
to meet all of our
business associates.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.391
They ain't all pretty.
Shine.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.662
* It's Ludacris, well,
then get out my way... *

09:54.695 --> 09:57.931
Andre. Dain-Ja?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.768
My father built Empire
from the streets.

10:00.801 --> 10:03.937
Shine beat Lucious
at his own game.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.974
I'm gonna see
how he rolls, Nessa.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.776
* Man, I be water whipping
like I'm going swimming *

10:08.809 --> 10:10.277
* Then I chef it up,
then hit the block *

10:10.310 --> 10:12.179
* Told me we would make
a bunch of money *

10:12.212 --> 10:14.181
* Funny thing is
we haven't seen no guap... *

10:14.214 --> 10:15.448
Shine.

10:15.482 --> 10:17.918
Yo.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.186
What's Freda doing?

10:19.219 --> 10:20.420
She's making a drop.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.855
She used to work
around her daddy.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.256
She know her way around.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.358
Let me introduce you
to somebody.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.761
Dain-Ja. This
my man Dain-Ja.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.596
He runs all the strip
clubs from Georgia

10:29.629 --> 10:31.598
to the Carolinas.
Any hip-hop

10:31.631 --> 10:33.300
we want in the
Southeastern market,

10:33.333 --> 10:35.703
this our guy.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.437
All right.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.140
* I don't really think
you 'bout that life *

10:40.173 --> 10:42.609
* All about that life... *

10:42.642 --> 10:44.377
I ain't trying to meet
new friends, you feel me?

10:44.411 --> 10:46.346
Look, man,
Andre's not a friend.

10:46.379 --> 10:47.715
He's family.

10:47.748 --> 10:48.816
So you got to chill.

10:48.849 --> 10:51.151
Hmm. (snorts) (spits)

10:52.585 --> 10:54.888
Really?

10:54.922 --> 10:56.489
Hey, you gonna clean that up.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.692
* I don't really think
you 'bout that life *

10:58.726 --> 11:01.695
* Just keep it real,
you ain't about that life *

11:01.729 --> 11:03.630
* You ain't
about that life, no. *

11:03.663 --> 11:05.833
(knocking at door)

11:11.839 --> 11:13.206
Welcome home, Mr. Mayor.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.641
Hey, hey.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.043
(chuckles)

11:16.076 --> 11:17.044
It's over.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.045
Yes.
It's done.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.346
Mwah.
Mwah.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.413
Ah.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.149
Oh, you feel so good.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.683
Come here, I have to
tell you something.
All right,

11:23.717 --> 11:25.652
so this is what's gonna
happen. All right.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
We're gonna be
aggressive. All right?

11:27.721 --> 11:28.722
And we're gonna take
our gloves off.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.023
Damn, you look gorgeous.

11:30.057 --> 11:31.024
(laughs)
Thanks.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.225
All right. Guns blazing.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.660
No holds barred,
no prisoners.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.562
We're gonna clap back.
I'm gonna do everything...

11:35.595 --> 11:37.765
What happened here?

11:37.798 --> 11:38.932
Oh, just-just a bruise.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.000
Baby, let me see.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.401
I-I bumped it. I'm a klutz.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.669
Let me look at it.
It's okay.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.604
Look, I really need
to tell you something, Angelo.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.906
Okay, but first

11:45.939 --> 11:47.941
we're gonna focus
on us right now.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.242
Right here.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.778
(laughs)
Ooh.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.212
Yes, together.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.713
Mm-hmm.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.348
(laughs)
You...

11:55.382 --> 11:56.349
(whoops)

11:56.383 --> 11:57.450
Oh, my goodness.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.086
Ain't nobody gonna bother us.

11:59.119 --> 12:00.687
Mm, you missed me
that much, huh?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.122
I missed you that much.
(both laugh)

12:09.396 --> 12:11.064
Lucious?

12:11.098 --> 12:14.234
LUCIOUS:
What? I'm in the bathroom.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.870
Well, don't you think
we need to talk about

12:16.904 --> 12:18.405
what happened
last...

12:18.438 --> 12:20.540
night?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.609
I have rehearsal
to get to, so...

12:22.642 --> 12:24.277
just let me know
if you need anything.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.578
Thanks.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.016
You need to want more
out of life, honey.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.089
(sighs)
Disgusting.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.225
After what you did last night?

12:38.258 --> 12:41.995
You left me high and dry
and bleeding, remember that?

12:42.029 --> 12:44.331
Why do you care what happens
between me and her?

12:44.364 --> 12:47.767
You're right.
I don't care. At all.

12:47.801 --> 12:49.436
Just don't say nothing.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.972
Don't say nothing
to who? Angelo?

12:52.005 --> 12:53.673
Oh, you didn't
want him to know

12:53.706 --> 12:57.310
about you turning into the
Tasmanian Devil last night?

12:57.344 --> 12:59.012
Look, I don't know
what got into us.

12:59.046 --> 13:01.148
Wait, how do you not know...

13:01.181 --> 13:03.016
It's simple,
you-you love me,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.452
you always will love me,
but you're not ready

13:05.485 --> 13:07.087
to deal with that
kind of truth.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.922
You know what? That's why I'm
gonna move on with my life.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.423
Okay?
Sounds like a plan.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.525
Good, w-what's going on?
Where's Jamal?

13:12.559 --> 13:14.794
He still in the studio
recording that wack-ass album,

13:14.828 --> 13:16.129
When Cookie Met Lucious?

13:16.163 --> 13:18.131
Like your wack ass
was the first one

13:18.165 --> 13:19.933
to come up with the title
Inferno.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.334
(scoffs)
It's corny.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.436
Look, just don't say nothing.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.637
It ain't none of my business.

13:24.671 --> 13:26.673
Yeah,
keep it that way.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.980
(indistinct chatter)

13:35.048 --> 13:36.016
Turn around.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.285
Hey, Becky.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.953
(sighs) Hi.

13:39.987 --> 13:42.856
Listen, I wanted to see if maybe
we could set aside some time

13:42.890 --> 13:45.058
to sit down, review the
artists and projects.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.861
All right,
Smokes Adams' album is done.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.496
Freaky Lyle's on tour.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.899
Hakeem is directing
Tiana's next video

13:51.932 --> 13:55.402
that will be on her album
that is released next week.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.737
You're all caught up.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.909
Look, Becky, I know
that you wanted the job.

14:01.942 --> 14:05.178
But not too long ago, you
were Lucious' assistant,

14:05.212 --> 14:06.579
and so you might not
be exactly ready

14:06.613 --> 14:08.215
to run a department.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.750
But listen, I am so
excited to work with you.

14:10.783 --> 14:12.986
I feel like you have
fantastic people skills.

14:13.020 --> 14:15.422
You always keep your
ear to the street.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.690
I'm going to lean on you.
A lot.

14:17.724 --> 14:21.361
I bet in a year or two,
you will have my job.

14:21.394 --> 14:23.396
TIANA:
Hey, um, Anika,

14:23.430 --> 14:26.099
I was wondering if you can watch
the rest of the rehearsals.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.367
Becky's in charge.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.768
She will be
your point person,

14:28.801 --> 14:30.904
and she has my full
and total support.

14:30.938 --> 14:33.073
Okay.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.807
Anika...

14:41.982 --> 14:43.917
I'm so glad you're back.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.254
* I'm on my knees *

14:47.287 --> 14:48.688
* Begging you to stay *

14:48.721 --> 14:51.258
* Yeah, you know if I could *

14:51.291 --> 14:52.625
* I'd take more, I would *

14:52.659 --> 14:54.861
Don't you think...

14:54.894 --> 14:57.130
* But it feels so good... *
Can you turn it down?

14:57.164 --> 14:59.099
(music fades)
I-I feel like we should just
take everything out

14:59.132 --> 15:01.301
except the horns.
It's too messy.

15:01.334 --> 15:02.970
Look, I get that you want
perfection, but just because

15:03.003 --> 15:04.471
you cleaned yourself up
doesn't mean

15:04.504 --> 15:05.605
you need to do the same thing
to your music.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.107
Oh, my Lord. Please, Tory.

15:07.140 --> 15:09.909
TORY: Oh, come on.
Being dirty can be fun.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.044
Okay, first of all,
it ain't that deep.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.645
Second of all,

15:12.679 --> 15:13.913
I damn near lost everything
from being too dirty,

15:13.947 --> 15:15.048
and so did you.

15:15.082 --> 15:16.749
Yeah, you know,
you're right, I did.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.051
That's where
we are right now.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.252
So we just got to
deal with it, okay?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.587
Whatever.
Just shut your mouth

15:20.620 --> 15:21.721
and just listen to this, okay?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.723
Check it out.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.458
(plays guitar riff)

15:29.029 --> 15:30.964
Okay.

15:30.998 --> 15:32.932
Check what out?

15:32.966 --> 15:36.403
Oh, come on.
That is like musical heroin.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.805
So you still like
drugs, crackhead?

15:38.838 --> 15:40.340
Well, there's the door.

15:40.373 --> 15:42.742
JAMAL:
Ma, it's a joke. Calm down.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.311
Yeah, well,
I don't find it funny.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.979
Now, I was listening

15:46.013 --> 15:47.947
to what y'all are doing and...

15:47.981 --> 15:49.616
it's-it's hot.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.484
You onto something,
but something's missing.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.886
So y'all got to mess it up
some more. Mess it up.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.789
Did you hear
what your mama said?

15:56.823 --> 15:58.425
Mess it up.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.492
(plays guitar riff)

16:10.903 --> 16:12.172
That's kind of hot.
What is that?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.207
It's a flattened fifth.
It's the devil's chord.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.043
All right, well she knows
what she's talking about.

16:16.076 --> 16:19.046
Well, look, it's a little
too dark, but check this out.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.314
Try this.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.792
COOKIE:
Yes, yes,

16:32.825 --> 16:34.327
Jamal, you... you keep doing
what you're doing,

16:34.361 --> 16:37.330
and, Tory, this time,
play like you...

16:37.364 --> 16:38.898
like you're trying
to talk to him,

16:38.931 --> 16:40.567
but he won't let
you get a word in.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.302
You just... Chase him.
That's what I mean.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.404
That's what
I want to... hear.

16:48.841 --> 16:49.842
Yes.

16:52.745 --> 16:55.082
Mm-hmm. That's it.
That's it.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.217
That's everything.
You got it. Look,

16:57.250 --> 16:59.719
your father's not to hear
anything we are creating here,

16:59.752 --> 17:00.920
you got that?
Mm-hmm.

17:00.953 --> 17:02.989
You erase these drives
every night, Jamal.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.191
Hear me?
Got you.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.259
Okay. Yeah,
that's in the pocket.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.760
Y'all keep creating.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.730
Play that funky music,
white girl.
(chuckles)

17:18.571 --> 17:20.540
Dwight broke his promise.

17:20.573 --> 17:22.609
Ms. Leah,
what are you doing here?
All I have is

17:22.642 --> 17:25.178
an hour before that
he-she knows I'm gone.

17:25.212 --> 17:27.447
Dwight said he was
getting rid of that wife,

17:27.480 --> 17:30.550
but instead he
gave her a job.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.052
'Cause she gave him one.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.521
A nasty one.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.256
You have to
do something.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.392
Boo Boo Kitty
knows things.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.194
Boo Boo Kitty?

17:41.228 --> 17:43.730
That's what his
other wife calls her.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.032
Cookie hates her

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
as much as I hate her.

17:50.937 --> 17:53.806
Come on inside for some tea.

18:06.353 --> 18:08.488
* I need that release *

18:08.521 --> 18:10.623
* It's taking me over *

18:10.657 --> 18:12.925
* Whatever you want,
whatever you say *

18:12.959 --> 18:14.827
* Just give me another *

18:14.861 --> 18:16.496
* And I'll be there for you *

18:16.529 --> 18:18.831
* Give it all to you *

18:18.865 --> 18:21.668
* You know I feen for you *

18:21.701 --> 18:23.136
* Yeah *

18:23.170 --> 18:24.637
TORY:
* And I'll never leave *

18:24.671 --> 18:27.174
* Everything that you say *

18:27.207 --> 18:29.309
* Is what I've been needing
to hear *

18:29.342 --> 18:31.311
* For all the rest of my days *

18:31.344 --> 18:33.680
* I don't need the truth *

18:33.713 --> 18:35.648
* Tell me what to do *

18:35.682 --> 18:38.017
* I believe in you *

18:41.188 --> 18:43.323
* And I know *

18:43.356 --> 18:45.292
* I don't really need it *

18:45.325 --> 18:47.360
* But I don't care *

18:47.394 --> 18:49.929
* I just wanna feel it *

18:49.962 --> 18:52.299
* 'Cause it's all in my mind *

18:52.332 --> 18:54.267
* Yeah *

18:54.301 --> 18:56.469
* Oh, it's all in my mind *

18:56.503 --> 18:59.105
BOTH:
* What I believe *

18:59.138 --> 19:00.840
* Is what you say *

19:00.873 --> 19:02.942
* Hey, I'm on my knees *

19:02.975 --> 19:04.777
* Begging you to stay *

19:04.811 --> 19:07.680
* Yeah, you know if I could *

19:07.714 --> 19:09.816
* I'd take more, I would *

19:09.849 --> 19:12.151
* Yeah, it hurts so bad *

19:12.185 --> 19:14.221
* But it feels so good *

19:14.254 --> 19:15.222
* I'm a feen *

19:15.255 --> 19:17.890
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

19:17.924 --> 19:19.692
* I'm a feen *

19:19.726 --> 19:22.529
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

19:22.562 --> 19:24.130
* I'm a feen *

19:24.163 --> 19:26.132
* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

19:26.165 --> 19:28.735
* No, it hurts so bad *

19:28.768 --> 19:30.703
* But it feels so good. *

19:30.737 --> 19:32.138
TORY:
Tell you what,

19:32.171 --> 19:34.474
I have not been this turned on
since I had Molly

19:34.507 --> 19:37.310
off a Jamaican soccer player's
back in Miami.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.078
Don't ever tell me
nothing like that again.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.080
(laughs)

19:41.113 --> 19:42.749
Man, don't wipe
the hard drive clean,

19:42.782 --> 19:44.351
'cause I might come back
and tweak it a little bit.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.386
All right?
Mm-hmm.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.995
Anika.

19:56.028 --> 19:59.366
It's time for you to
start talking to me.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.200
You know what, Tariq,
if that were possible,

20:01.234 --> 20:03.503
it would have happened a
long time ago. What do you want?

20:03.536 --> 20:06.172
True, I can't get you to
confess against Lucious,

20:06.205 --> 20:08.941
but you're not married to
Cookie, as far as I know.

20:08.975 --> 20:11.077
I didn't want to do this,
but I'm doing it now.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.512
I don't know anything
about Cookie.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.848
Maybe you can tell me if
these names ring a bell.

20:15.882 --> 20:17.116
Frank Gathers.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.618
Of course I know
who Frank Gathers was,

20:18.651 --> 20:19.886
but I never met him.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.220
Jermel Stubbs.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.722
Bam-Bam King.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.257
Teddy McNally.

20:24.291 --> 20:25.692
Oh...
Taxi!

20:25.725 --> 20:27.059
Tell me about Teddy McNally.
Get off me, man.

20:27.093 --> 20:28.795
Yeah, he got bodied
back in Philly

20:28.828 --> 20:30.196
about a year and a half ago.

20:30.229 --> 20:32.265
Do you know
who made the hit?
No.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.867
You're lying.
I'm gonna put you in WITSEC

20:34.901 --> 20:36.369
so you'll feel free to talk.

20:36.403 --> 20:37.904
Witness Protection?
Uh-huh.

20:37.937 --> 20:38.938
(laughs)
You got jokes.

20:38.971 --> 20:39.972
Bang.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.240
That's a subpoena.

20:41.274 --> 20:43.476
What?
Mm-hmm.

20:43.510 --> 20:44.944
See, when Lucious
finds out,

20:44.977 --> 20:46.579
he'll arrange for you
to disappear.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.248
So you can accept
the government's protection,

20:49.282 --> 20:51.518
or you can take your chances.

20:53.286 --> 20:54.654
Don't do this to me, Tariq.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.324
Please do not
do this to me.

20:57.357 --> 20:59.959
Everything is just starting
to get together for me, man.

21:03.863 --> 21:05.498
What about my daughter?

21:07.800 --> 21:09.902
Go home.

21:09.936 --> 21:11.237
Act like nothing's wrong.

21:11.270 --> 21:13.906
Tomorrow I'll pick
you both up at 2:45

21:13.940 --> 21:16.576
on the southeast side
of Union Square.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.278
All right? Whoa.

21:21.180 --> 21:23.182
I'd hate to see
this pretty face wash up

21:23.215 --> 21:25.985
on the banks
of the Hudson, mami.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.120
Be there, all right?

21:34.461 --> 21:35.862
(chuckles)

21:47.840 --> 21:49.842
(sighs)

22:08.094 --> 22:11.698
Let's see what these idiots
are up to.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.702
*

22:19.005 --> 22:21.340
* I need that release *

22:21.374 --> 22:23.175
* It's taking... *
(music stops)

22:28.347 --> 22:30.349
* Me over *

22:30.383 --> 22:32.519
* Whatever you want,
whatever you say *

22:32.552 --> 22:35.988
* Just give me another,
and I'll be there for you *

22:36.022 --> 22:38.491
* Give it all to you *

22:38.525 --> 22:40.660
* You know I feen for you *

22:40.693 --> 22:42.028
* Yeah. *

22:42.061 --> 22:44.196
(music stops)

22:46.733 --> 22:48.735
(piano playing)

23:07.153 --> 23:09.155
*

23:20.633 --> 23:23.436
JAMAL:
Mom, just wait and listen to
what me and Tory did last night.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.804
(music playing in distance)

23:24.837 --> 23:26.473
Who the hell is in here?

23:26.506 --> 23:28.374
We got this studio booked
for three months.

23:28.407 --> 23:31.377
LUCIOUS:
No, it's got to have the fire,

23:31.410 --> 23:33.379
or I can't hear it.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.715
This album has to be pure flame,

23:35.748 --> 23:38.585
everything on it.
Dad, what is this?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.286
You hear me, Ness?

23:40.319 --> 23:42.822
You hear me, V? Pure love.
Got you.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.924
JAMAL: Please tell these people
to get out of the studio,

23:44.957 --> 23:47.093
because I booked the time.
It's my time.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.127
Dad.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.162
COOKIE:
He don't even hear you.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.798
I know that look in his eyes.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.733
(train passing)

23:53.766 --> 23:55.568
* Wave ya hands
high in the sky *

23:55.602 --> 23:58.471
* I got a hot girl
and my gear is fly *

23:58.505 --> 24:01.073
* Truth or dare,
never tell you a lie *

24:01.107 --> 24:02.675
* Everybody want
to be a gangsta *
Lucious.

24:02.709 --> 24:06.546
* But nobody really want
to die. *

24:08.280 --> 24:10.483
Lucious.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.957
Lucious!

24:17.990 --> 24:20.126
What's up?

24:20.159 --> 24:22.695
I'm pregnant.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.697
(train passes in distance)

24:27.399 --> 24:28.935
*

24:28.968 --> 24:32.972
Whenever he gets like that,
all he can hear is the music.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.207
*

24:35.241 --> 24:39.445
* And the world cannot deny *

24:39.478 --> 24:43.482
* What was once laid to rest *

24:44.984 --> 24:46.719
* Has come back *

24:46.753 --> 24:49.622
That's fire, right?

24:49.656 --> 24:51.624
* I feel it in my soul... *

24:51.658 --> 24:53.225
I am...

24:53.259 --> 24:55.528
the sun.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.997
Just because you yellow
don't mean you the sun.

24:58.030 --> 25:01.000
* Rule my world *

25:01.033 --> 25:02.501
* The only thing... *

25:02.535 --> 25:05.171
The song is dope, Dad.

25:05.204 --> 25:08.174
The king don't have
to prove who he is, though.

25:08.207 --> 25:11.010
* But now, but now *

25:11.043 --> 25:13.212
BOTH:
* We bow down at his feet *

25:13.245 --> 25:16.048
* The crown is his alone *

25:16.082 --> 25:19.418
* I'm looking at my king *

25:19.451 --> 25:21.387
* Take back his throne *

25:21.420 --> 25:23.489
* And he's returned
for you and me *

25:23.522 --> 25:25.257
* We won't ever be alone... *

25:25.291 --> 25:26.693
Um, sweetie.

25:26.726 --> 25:29.095
I really liked
your stuff.

25:29.128 --> 25:32.398
* Take back his throne *

25:32.431 --> 25:34.400
* Whoa *

25:34.433 --> 25:36.836
* Take back his throne *

25:36.869 --> 25:39.171
* Oh *

25:39.205 --> 25:42.374
* Take back his throne. *

25:48.615 --> 25:50.249
*

25:55.922 --> 25:57.890
Rakon.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.959
Rakon.

25:59.992 --> 26:01.193
Give me five.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.228
(music stops)

26:04.096 --> 26:06.733
(door opens)

26:06.766 --> 26:09.636
(door shuts)
So tell me more about this meet
Dain-Ja's hooking up.

26:09.669 --> 26:12.304
You ever heard of Rafael Green?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.306
Bought up a bunch
of strip clubs.

26:14.340 --> 26:15.742
Major player in Vegas.

26:15.775 --> 26:16.743
That's the guy.

26:16.776 --> 26:18.778
He got a spot on the Strip now.

26:18.811 --> 26:21.213
He's looking to book
some legit talent.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.850
I want in.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.554
What?

26:28.587 --> 26:30.957
Nessa told me
about the pills you take.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.225
Did she?

26:33.259 --> 26:35.261
She tells me everything,
so get used to it.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.163
But I tell you what,

26:37.196 --> 26:41.100
if you ever think
about laying a hand on her...

26:41.133 --> 26:43.102
I'd never put my hands on her,
okay?

26:43.135 --> 26:45.137
I take mood stabilizers.
That's it.

26:45.171 --> 26:48.975
Mood stabili... And I'm supposed
to trust you with my business.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.477
And let me remind you,
you don't have a choice.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.012
Now, I've been trying

26:53.045 --> 26:55.281
to get Lucious interested
in Vegas for years.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.283
The only reason that Rafael
agreed to meet with me

26:57.316 --> 26:59.285
is 'cause I said I could
introduce him to Lucious.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.688
Okay, well, then tell him
that nobody meets Lucious

27:01.721 --> 27:03.322
until they pass muster with me.

27:03.355 --> 27:06.158
Vegas is big business
for Empire.

27:06.192 --> 27:09.028
If I put a deal together,
then the board'll back me

27:09.061 --> 27:11.664
when I make my move
to take over the company.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.666
So to answer your question...
I didn't ask you

27:13.700 --> 27:14.967
any questions.

27:21.073 --> 27:23.976
To answer your question,

27:24.010 --> 27:27.379
I need Lucious alive long enough
to put a deal together.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.515
It's simple.

27:31.517 --> 27:33.920
I look forward
to meeting Rafael.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.695
(sighs)
Bella.

27:42.729 --> 27:44.831
Bella, baby, Mommy loves you.

27:44.864 --> 27:47.166
Mommy loves you so much.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.869
I got to do this for me and you.

27:49.902 --> 27:52.739
Mommy loves you.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.942
(brakes squeak)

27:57.276 --> 27:59.178
Anika, what the hell?

27:59.211 --> 28:01.380
I was on my way
to dress rehearsal.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.015
I'm sorry, look, I know.
I-I need you

28:03.049 --> 28:04.751
to take Bella for me, please.
I have to go somewhere.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.585
So call Juanita.
Juanita is not her father,

28:06.618 --> 28:08.420
Hakeem, you are.

28:08.454 --> 28:10.857
Look, you are responsible
for keeping her safe.

28:10.890 --> 28:12.091
I need you to
help me, please.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.425
Thank you.

28:13.459 --> 28:16.228
So you're just gonna
put this on me?

28:16.262 --> 28:19.565
Hakeem, for once in your life,
I need you to step up.

28:22.301 --> 28:24.036
Thank you.

28:24.070 --> 28:26.538
What time you picking her up?
I'll call you.

28:26.572 --> 28:27.807
When?

28:33.245 --> 28:35.114
U.S. Probation Office, ma'am.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.682
We'd like
to see Cookie Lyon.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.085
Can you have her
come down, please?

28:42.421 --> 28:43.689
(whispering):
Cookie.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.057
Cookie!

28:45.091 --> 28:46.692
What?

28:46.725 --> 28:48.027
What?

28:48.060 --> 28:49.628
Those suspicious-looking
people over there

28:49.661 --> 28:50.930
are looking for you.

28:58.771 --> 29:01.307
Angelo? I need you
to come get me.

29:01.340 --> 29:02.708
Right now.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.543
(brakes squeak)

29:04.576 --> 29:07.279
I'm here. I don't see you.

29:14.253 --> 29:15.888
(tires screech)

29:15.922 --> 29:18.825
All right, so I spoke to my
boy Gus, and you were right.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.659
They are violating
your parole.

29:20.692 --> 29:21.928
For what?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.495
Associating with a known felon.

29:23.529 --> 29:26.232
Ugh, come on.
(scoffs)

29:26.265 --> 29:27.733
I have a hip-hop label.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.568
Do you know how many
of our artists

29:29.601 --> 29:31.570
got criminal records?
That's petty.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.072
I got the violation
rescinded.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.674
They're gonna give me a heads-up
if this happens again.

29:35.707 --> 29:38.544
We got to figure out why
they're coming after you now.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.950
(sighs)

29:45.952 --> 29:47.519
All right. You know
what? That's it.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.955
Take me to Lucious Lyon's crib.

29:48.988 --> 29:50.256
Uh, Angelo, I don't think...
Cookie.

29:50.289 --> 29:52.024
...that's a good idea.
Uh-uh.

29:52.058 --> 29:53.759
All right, look. We can drop
you off or you can come with.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.362
But I'm done. This
has got to stop.

29:56.395 --> 30:00.066
Lucious Lyon has to know
when to fall back.

30:01.667 --> 30:03.903
Corny-ass hairdo.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.673
(elevator bell dings)

30:15.481 --> 30:16.815
Hey.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.020
Look, Derek, I asked you to

30:21.053 --> 30:22.955
come over here 'cause I wanted
to tell you in person.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.824
Um, I'm working
with a new producer on my album.

30:25.858 --> 30:28.360
Tory Ash. You know
her-- she's dope.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.496
We've been vibing hard,
and my mom likes her,

30:30.529 --> 30:31.763
so that's good.

30:34.066 --> 30:35.868
Tory Ash?

30:35.902 --> 30:38.070
Come on, Tory Ash?

30:38.104 --> 30:40.306
The "no-Tory-ous"
one-album wonder?

30:40.339 --> 30:41.640
Yes.
(scoffs)

30:41.673 --> 30:43.642
Hmm. Hey, man,
I'm willing to take the hits.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.211
Whatever.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.479
So what's up with us, huh?

30:47.513 --> 30:50.349
Come on, Derek, man,
there's-- there is no us.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.018
We-we done hooked up
a bunch of times,

30:52.051 --> 30:55.654
and-- but most of
those times I was high.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.724
I'm clear
and sober now.

30:58.757 --> 31:01.093
Come on, you're still
in the closet, anyway.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.663
Main part of my recovery
is truth and honesty,

31:04.696 --> 31:06.565
and that's... that's
definitely not you.

31:31.290 --> 31:33.859
'Sup, Becky?

31:33.892 --> 31:35.761
What's going on?
Why aren't they ready to block?

31:35.794 --> 31:38.864
Actually, your
director-slash-boo

31:38.897 --> 31:41.267
has yet to arrive,
so we're waiting.

31:41.300 --> 31:42.935
Are you serious?

31:42.969 --> 31:44.903
He knows how important this is.
HAKEEM:
I'm here, I'm here, sorry.

31:44.937 --> 31:47.106
BECKY (laughing):
You brought the baby.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.907
(gasping):
Aw.

31:48.941 --> 31:50.542
Aw.

31:50.576 --> 31:51.910
Hi.

31:51.944 --> 31:55.081
Hakeem, why is the baby here?

31:55.114 --> 31:57.950
You can't be seriously trying
to force this on me right now.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.585
T, I had no choice.

31:59.618 --> 32:01.887
Anika took off. I don't
know where she went.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.056
Baby, you got to trust
me. I'm the father.

32:04.090 --> 32:07.059
I got you, I got us,
but I also got Bella, too.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.328
And you gotta understand that.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.463
It's my responsibility.

32:11.497 --> 32:13.665
You got to be
cool with that.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.034
Cool with her.

32:16.768 --> 32:19.438
She's so pretty.

32:19.471 --> 32:20.572
HAKEEM:
Thank you.

32:20.606 --> 32:21.873
BECKY:
Here you go.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.916
She's really pretty.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.818
Thanks.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.088
(sniffs)

32:36.122 --> 32:37.356
(chuckles)

32:37.389 --> 32:39.291
Her head smells so good.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.827
Yeah, baby heads.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.030
Here.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.364
Hold her.

32:49.401 --> 32:51.237
Yeah, hold
her closer.

32:52.538 --> 32:53.939
Dance with her.

32:53.972 --> 32:56.108
Yeah, just like that.

32:56.142 --> 32:57.709
Let her feel your heartbeat.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.379
(chuckles softly)

33:07.153 --> 33:10.489
I don't need your little drink.
This ain't a social call.

33:10.522 --> 33:12.724
I'm here to tell you:
step back. All right?

33:12.758 --> 33:14.460
I have her.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.961
You've lost. I...
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.464
You don't come in my house
making demands

33:18.497 --> 33:20.499
like you got some kind
of authority here, man.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.634
I'm not one
of your constituents.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.637
Why was her parole violated,
Lucious?

33:25.671 --> 33:27.473
LUCIOUS:
Is he serious?
Yes.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.841
I don't have nothing
to do with that.

33:29.875 --> 33:31.743
You expect me to believe that?
You... (laughs)

33:31.777 --> 33:33.245
You put a bounty on my head.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.414
If I want to mess with somebody,

33:35.447 --> 33:38.584
I know how to mess with somebody
I'm interested in.

33:38.617 --> 33:39.851
That's not what I do.

33:39.885 --> 33:41.687
But I will find out
who did do this.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.322
No, we don't need
your help, man.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.390
Put your little phone...
Wait, wait, wait.

33:44.423 --> 33:45.591
Hey, don't put your
hands on me, baby.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.025
Okay, hold up, hold up, all
right, all right, all right.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.860
(phone ringing)
Your phone is ringing.
Answer your phone.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.430
Go ahead.

33:51.463 --> 33:52.864
Campaign manager.
Mm-hmm.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.366
Mm-hmm.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.568
You know who this is,
it's Tariq.

33:56.602 --> 33:58.570
Maybe if he puts you in
a lockdown situation,

33:58.604 --> 34:00.339
you're gonna roll or
something like that.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.875
Oh, so I'm supposed to do time
again to protect you? Uh-uh.

34:03.909 --> 34:05.111
Wait, wait,
what, protect me?

34:05.144 --> 34:06.712
You know, I like

34:06.745 --> 34:08.747
the way you blame me
for the stuff that you did.

34:08.780 --> 34:10.516
You know, I didn't kick
this thing off.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.118
You're the one that ordered
everything on the damn menu.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.419
Can you shut up?

34:13.452 --> 34:15.287
I just had
to pay for it.

34:15.321 --> 34:17.022
And I cleaned up after you--
that's what I do.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.124
I clean up after all of y'all.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.891
Yeah, you better have.

34:19.925 --> 34:21.427
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

34:21.460 --> 34:22.428
Everything okay?

34:22.461 --> 34:23.595
I hope so.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.431
It's the last couple of polls.

34:25.464 --> 34:27.233
What, you trying
to scratch your way

34:27.266 --> 34:28.934
back into the damn race?

34:28.967 --> 34:32.604
(chuckles) See, you had
to scratch your way to power.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.806
See, I was born with mine.

34:36.608 --> 34:37.909
Ooh.

34:37.943 --> 34:39.578
Oh, and Mr. Lyon...

34:39.611 --> 34:41.247
(chuckles)

34:41.280 --> 34:43.582
...if I do decide
to come for you,

34:43.615 --> 34:45.917
you're going to experience
a kind of pain

34:45.951 --> 34:48.454
that you've never experienced.

34:51.423 --> 34:53.225
Believe that.

34:53.259 --> 34:55.694
(chuckles)
(scoffs)
Come on, baby.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.267
*

35:18.984 --> 35:21.920
So, what is this, you...
you putting on a show for me?

35:21.953 --> 35:23.489
Who told you?

35:23.522 --> 35:26.325
No, I'm just mad that you
get so freakin' upset at me

35:26.358 --> 35:28.093
about that little
stuff with the studio.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.762
How do you get that
mad at me, man?

35:30.796 --> 35:33.199
Look, anyway,
what I realized is that

35:33.232 --> 35:35.267
the confines of that
little bitty studio is

35:35.301 --> 35:38.937
too small to contain
a movement.

35:38.970 --> 35:40.472
Welcome to the true studio.

35:40.506 --> 35:43.509
I mean, where every note
will melt you to the core,

35:43.542 --> 35:46.512
but at the same time,
it refreshes you.

35:46.545 --> 35:49.848
You know, no multitracking,
no Auto-Tunes--

35:49.881 --> 35:52.451
all those crutches that these
kids are using these days.

35:52.484 --> 35:54.353
But after all of this,
there was still one thing

35:54.386 --> 35:56.288
that was missing.

35:56.322 --> 35:58.056
You gave it to me.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.725
* Has come back... *

35:59.758 --> 36:01.660
What, now you're shaking
in your boots?

36:01.693 --> 36:03.862
Uh-huh, shiver on, man.

36:03.895 --> 36:04.863
(both laugh)
(guitar playing)

36:04.896 --> 36:06.998
* I know I'm ready for it *

36:07.032 --> 36:09.468
* And now he's stronger
than before *

36:09.501 --> 36:10.702
That chord.

36:10.736 --> 36:14.139
* Ready to rule my world *

36:14.172 --> 36:16.542
It's the devil's chord.

36:16.575 --> 36:19.010
Yeah, she told me
you didn't want to use it.

36:19.044 --> 36:20.712
I was like, are you crazy?

36:20.746 --> 36:22.147
Do you hear this?

36:22.180 --> 36:24.149
* But now, but now *

36:24.182 --> 36:26.352
* We bow down at his feet *
Jamal.

36:26.385 --> 36:29.154
* The crown is his alone... *

36:29.187 --> 36:31.189
It's just music, man.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.158
* Take back his throne... *

36:33.191 --> 36:35.594
You just keep
playing with me, man.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.564
No-- it's like I don't know what
to do with you anymore, man.

36:38.597 --> 36:39.931
Everything...

36:39.965 --> 36:40.932
All right, all right,
all right, I get you.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.468
TORY:
Jamal.

36:44.370 --> 36:45.871
PHILIP: Is this what you
and Tory was working on?

36:45.904 --> 36:49.207
Yeah, this stupid-ass song.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.610
Trusted her wack ass.

36:51.643 --> 36:54.713
Trusted her at rehab.

36:54.746 --> 36:56.682
We were like partners
at rehab. I can't even lie.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.850
Ah, she was dope.
That music was so good.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.352
It was so good.

37:00.386 --> 37:01.587
(chuckles)

37:01.620 --> 37:03.622
I can't stand my father.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.023
(laughs)

37:05.056 --> 37:07.693
Oh, that's
a laughing matter.

37:07.726 --> 37:08.927
Somebody say they
can't stand their father.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.062
I didn't mean to...

37:11.096 --> 37:13.064
(laughs)

37:13.098 --> 37:15.033
If you see what I see,
you'd be laughing, too.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.101
I'm so sure.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.369
I mean, look at you.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.737
Last time I saw you,
I was barely able

37:18.770 --> 37:20.572
to recognize you
because of that addiction.

37:20.606 --> 37:24.743
I just really wanted to
make sure you're doing good.

37:24.776 --> 37:28.113
I see you,
you're doing good.

37:28.146 --> 37:30.549
* Ain't no shame,
back it up on me *

37:30.582 --> 37:31.883
Maybe I should go.

37:31.917 --> 37:34.219
* On up *
* Yeah, yeah *

37:34.252 --> 37:37.155
* Yeah *
* Back that ... up *

37:37.188 --> 37:39.291
Maybe you should stay.

37:39.325 --> 37:41.627
* On up *
* Yeah, yeah *

37:41.660 --> 37:43.295
* Back that ... up *
* Yeah *

37:43.329 --> 37:46.965
* Back it up *
* Door's open... *

37:46.998 --> 37:49.635
So, as mayor...

37:49.668 --> 37:52.137
are you planning on
living at Gracie Mansion?

37:52.170 --> 37:55.140
(laughs)
'Cause, you know, if so,
Cookie can't stay there.

37:55.173 --> 37:57.909
Yes, this is true;
it's an archaic rule.

37:57.943 --> 38:01.146
Cookie cannot spend the night
unless we're married.

38:01.179 --> 38:03.281
Now, that's what
I'm talking about, no?

38:03.315 --> 38:05.150
All right, Candace.

38:05.183 --> 38:06.785
And it's about time
my baby sister

38:06.818 --> 38:09.087
had herself a proper wedding.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.089
Hmm.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.124
(train passing)

38:13.158 --> 38:15.327
* Me and Romeo *

38:15.361 --> 38:17.629
* Ain't never been friends *

38:17.663 --> 38:19.030
(indistinct chatter)

38:19.064 --> 38:20.666
* Can't you see how much *

38:20.699 --> 38:23.669
* I really love ya? *

38:23.702 --> 38:25.337
* Gonna sing it to ya *

38:25.371 --> 38:28.440
* Time and time again *

38:28.474 --> 38:31.810
* Oh, Casanova... *

38:31.843 --> 38:33.278
(chuckles)

38:33.311 --> 38:35.313
Lucious.

38:38.350 --> 38:41.286
We got Miss Bertha's
potluck chicken.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.555
My boys ready
with the music.

38:43.589 --> 38:46.392
You in this pretty dress.

38:46.425 --> 38:50.161
Me in... (laughs)
whatever the hell this is.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.468
You, me and our baby...

38:56.502 --> 38:58.470
that's all I need.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.072
All I'm ever gonna need.

39:01.106 --> 39:03.575
Feel me?

39:13.685 --> 39:16.588
I'm so sorry for this hag bitch.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.756
(laughing):
Oh.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.427
And I swear to you,
this was not a setup.

39:21.460 --> 39:23.161
That's okay, baby.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.730
Let's see if I become
mayor first.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.665
Then we can talk.

39:26.698 --> 39:29.300
Yes.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.442
Rafael's such
a big player,

39:36.475 --> 39:38.243
why are we meeting
him in a warehouse?

39:38.276 --> 39:39.911
This is my deal, Shine.

39:39.945 --> 39:42.113
Why do we need him?

39:42.147 --> 39:44.950
RAFAEL:
You know, I got
the same question.

39:46.452 --> 39:47.819
This is my party.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.256
And it's invitation only.

39:51.289 --> 39:52.458
Hmm.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.598
Who's this clown
you brought to my party?

39:59.631 --> 40:01.733
This is Andre Lyon.

40:01.767 --> 40:03.001
He's my partner.

40:04.670 --> 40:06.137
He's solid.

40:08.840 --> 40:11.443
Andre Lyon?

40:11.477 --> 40:13.779
That's right.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.113
(scoffs)

40:17.483 --> 40:19.818
Giuliana!

40:22.688 --> 40:24.590
Wait, who's that?

40:24.623 --> 40:28.026
RAFAEL:
That is my wife.

40:29.661 --> 40:32.464
Giusi, get over here.
(sniffs)

40:32.498 --> 40:35.801
Bitch... come here,
come here, come here.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.636
Don't start with me,
Rafael.
Come here,
get over here.

40:37.669 --> 40:39.104
Don't start with me.
Get over here.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.305
You don't need to put
your hands on me, Rafi.
Shut up!

40:40.338 --> 40:42.173
Shut up.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.342
Did you know this is

40:44.375 --> 40:46.444
Lucious Lyon's son?

40:46.478 --> 40:48.179
Hmm?
Yes.

40:48.213 --> 40:49.815
But I didn't know
he was coming here.

40:51.382 --> 40:53.985
Uh-huh.

40:54.019 --> 40:56.154
(gasps)
RAFAEL: Did you set me up?

40:56.187 --> 40:58.156
No.
Did you?

40:58.189 --> 40:59.658
GIULIANA:
No, I didn't set you up!

40:59.691 --> 41:01.459
I told you I didn't know
anybody was coming here.

41:01.493 --> 41:03.328
If you're lying to me, I will
kill you, you know that, right?

41:03.361 --> 41:05.330
You know that, right?
Come here.
(Giuliana crying)

41:05.363 --> 41:07.365
Come here, come here,
come here.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.468
Do you know this bitch?

41:10.502 --> 41:12.470
No.

41:12.504 --> 41:13.872
No?

41:13.905 --> 41:14.873
No?
You're hurting my neck!

41:14.906 --> 41:15.874
Shut up!

41:15.907 --> 41:17.543
Ow.

41:17.576 --> 41:19.645
That don't mean I'm cool with
you hitting on her, though.

41:19.678 --> 41:20.812
Let her go.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.514
Yeah, I'll let her go.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.849
Let me go... please.

41:23.882 --> 41:25.150
Why don't you go fix your face?

41:25.183 --> 41:27.352
Go, go on.
I didn't do anything!

41:27.385 --> 41:28.520
You fix your face.
Get over there.

41:28.554 --> 41:29.721
You're a mess.

41:29.755 --> 41:32.190
You make me sick.

41:32.223 --> 41:33.992
(Giuliana crying)
I can't believe
you set me up.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.326
I didn't set you up.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.362
RAFAEL: Shut up.
Enough.

41:40.065 --> 41:41.867
SHINE:
Hey, we gonna get down
to business, or what?

41:43.869 --> 41:45.070
RAFAEL:
Uh-huh.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.079
I'll deal with
you later.

41:57.048 --> 41:59.050
(screams)
(grunts)

42:00.385 --> 42:02.387
(gasping)

42:09.127 --> 42:12.197
What's wrong with you, bitch?

42:12.230 --> 42:14.132
(gunshot)

42:32.417 --> 42:33.752
Thank you.

42:33.785 --> 42:35.086
ANDRE:
No.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.789
Thank you.

42:39.424 --> 42:42.761
Well.

42:42.794 --> 42:46.798
I'm sorry we got off
to such a messy start...

42:46.832 --> 42:49.801
...but I'm still available to do
business if you're interested.

43:01.613 --> 43:03.915
How long has he been
doing this to you?

43:03.949 --> 43:06.685
It doesn't matter.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.989
You still have Vegas?

43:11.990 --> 43:13.491
Barely.

43:13.524 --> 43:15.293
Then we're still interested
in doing business.

44:01.239 --> 44:02.207
Yeah.

Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:06.845 --> 44:08.513
ANNOUNCER: You've just
watched Empire.

44:08.546 --> 44:11.316
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:12.550 --> 44:14.319
(gunshot)

44:14.352 --> 44:16.621
Shots Fired is
a murder mystery.

44:16.654 --> 44:19.457
An African-American officer
kills an unarmed white guy.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.193
I asked him
to step out of the vehicle,
but as he steps out,

44:22.227 --> 44:24.462
he reaches for my gun,
and it was either him or me.

44:24.495 --> 44:25.931
-And I shot him.
-Four times.

44:27.498 --> 44:30.035
WOMAN: Preston and Ashe are
a prosecutor and an investigator

44:30.068 --> 44:31.837
come down to investigate.

44:31.870 --> 44:34.906
They uncover a second teenager
that was killed-- a black teen.

44:34.940 --> 44:38.476
Suddenly, there's these two
racially charged shootings
they're investigating.

44:38.509 --> 44:41.346
I play Ashe Akino.
She has lots of layers.

44:41.379 --> 44:43.481
She is not perfect.

44:43.514 --> 44:45.516
Sometimes she will do
whatever it takes

44:45.550 --> 44:47.685
to get what she wants
in a case.

44:47.719 --> 44:51.056
Preston's a graduate
from Harvard, working for
the Department of Justice.

44:51.089 --> 44:55.026
As the series progresses,
his idealism will be tested.

44:55.060 --> 44:57.763
All I care about is the truth,
and my truth has no color.

44:57.796 --> 45:00.365
A tragedy has come
to Gate Station,

45:00.398 --> 45:02.667
and when there are questions,
I want answers.

45:02.700 --> 45:05.570
Our mantra for the show
is get the audience
at the edge of their seat,

45:05.603 --> 45:07.405
and when they're
leaning forward,
hit 'em with the truth.
