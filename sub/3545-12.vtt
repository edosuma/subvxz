00:00.166 --> 00:01.917
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.000 --> 00:05.792
- These are nice people.
- My money says one of 'em isn't.

00:05.875 --> 00:09.250
- How creepy is Mrs. Huber's sister?
<i>- Promises were made.</i>

00:09.375 --> 00:12.291
I'm going to find out
exactly what happened to her.

00:12.375 --> 00:15.250
<i>- Marriages came undone.</i>
- We are starting a family.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.125
We're not negotiating my uterus.

00:17.208 --> 00:20.333
- Would you go out to dinner with me?
- Like a date?

00:20.417 --> 00:22.375
- A date?
<i>- And the truth...</i>

00:22.458 --> 00:24.875
- You burned her house down.
<i>- ...was denied.</i>

00:24.959 --> 00:28.291
I absolutely did not
do that thing you accused me of.

00:30.959 --> 00:35.458
<i>Martha Huber waited her whole life</i>
<i>for something to happen to her,</i>

00:35.583 --> 00:38.166
<i>something exciting.</i>

00:38.291 --> 00:43.458
<i>As a child she hoped to be</i>
<i>kidnapped by a band of pirates.</i>

00:43.583 --> 00:49.458
<i>As a teenager she dreamt of being</i>
<i>discovered by a Hollywood talent scout.</i>

00:49.542 --> 00:51.667
<i>As a young woman she fantasized</i>

00:51.750 --> 00:56.583
<i>a handsome millionaire</i>
<i>would sweep her off her feet.</i>

00:56.667 --> 01:00.667
<i>But the years had flown by</i>
<i>and still nothing exciting</i>

01:00.750 --> 01:03.041
<i>had ever happened to Martha Huber.</i>

01:06.166 --> 01:09.291
<i>Until the night she was murdered.</i>

01:09.375 --> 01:12.834
Hello, Mrs. Huber.
Let me give you a hand.

01:12.917 --> 01:15.417
- That's really not necessary.
- I insist.

01:15.500 --> 01:20.875
<i>In those last moments it occurred</i>
<i>to her, in addition to being boring,</i>

01:20.959 --> 01:24.583
<i>life could also be very cruel.</i>

01:25.959 --> 01:30.375
<i>Luckily for Mrs. Huber,</i>
<i>death was far more merciful.</i>

01:34.333 --> 01:36.458
What do you think?

01:37.125 --> 01:40.125
That's our missing woman all right.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.917
Didn't take the media long
to get wind of this.

01:45.000 --> 01:48.125
Make sure no one contaminates
my crime scene.

01:57.417 --> 02:01.792
Hey, little lady. A lot of people
are looking for you. You know that?

02:01.917 --> 02:06.041
Your face is gonna be on the front page
of every paper in this state.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.208
How's that for exciting?

02:08.333 --> 02:12.625
<i>Officer Jackson couldn't be sure,</i>
<i>but for a brief moment,</i>

02:12.750 --> 02:17.959
<i>he thought he saw the corpse</i>
<i>of Martha Huber smile.</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:10.125
<i>Death had come once again</i>
<i>to Wisteria Lane.</i>

03:10.208 --> 03:13.375
I'm afraid I have
some bad news for you.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.959
We found your sister's body.

03:20.542 --> 03:24.667
<i>Word of the tragedy would soon spread</i>
<i>throughout the neighborhood.</i>

03:24.750 --> 03:29.500
<i>But for now people went about</i>
<i>their lives as they always did,</i>

03:29.583 --> 03:31.709
<i>blissfully unaware.</i>

03:34.166 --> 03:37.375
- Hello? Anybody home?
- In the kitchen.

03:37.458 --> 03:39.500
Good news. I finished my book.

03:39.583 --> 03:42.792
So I thought to celebrate
you could take me out to lunch.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.000
- Susan.
- Can we do a rain check?

03:45.083 --> 03:47.500
We're looking at the plans
for her house.

03:47.583 --> 03:50.166
My insurance company's
cutting my check.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.333
There's only one plumber I want.

03:52.417 --> 03:57.208
Don't expect to see this guy for a few
months. I'm gonna be riding him hard.

03:57.291 --> 04:02.208
Well, if anybody can go the distance,
he can. I should know.

04:02.917 --> 04:04.959
See ya.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.417
Mike.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.333
Mike, we're on the clock.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.375
Hey, Felicia. What's up?

04:32.500 --> 04:35.041
Edie?

04:35.166 --> 04:37.875
They found Martha.

04:37.959 --> 04:42.250
Here, blow. Good.
All right, come on.

04:42.333 --> 04:44.834
This is gonna be fun. Follow me.

04:54.917 --> 04:58.125
Excuse me? You can't do that.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.375
I'm here for the 10.00am
yoga meditation class.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.583
Unfortunately,
the daycare center's full.

05:04.667 --> 05:08.125
Yeah, I noticed that,
but every time I come here it's full.

05:08.208 --> 05:11.333
It's a popular class,
and the other moms come early.

05:11.417 --> 05:15.333
Look, all I can tell you
is plan ahead next time.

05:17.375 --> 05:21.083
Lauren, I'm a mother of four.
Today I had to get up at five,

05:21.166 --> 05:24.542
make lunches, make breakfast,
drop the twins at school

05:24.667 --> 05:27.792
and get across town
lugging a baby and a sick child.

05:27.875 --> 05:31.375
Telling me to plan ahead
is like telling me to sprout wings.

05:31.458 --> 05:35.583
And things like being told
to plan ahead make me so crazy

05:35.667 --> 05:37.834
that yoga is the only thing
to relax me.

05:37.917 --> 05:43.917
Except I show up here and I can't
get in, and you tell me to plan ahead.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.458
It's a vicious cycle.
See how that works?

05:47.542 --> 05:51.959
If I broke the rules for you, I'd have
to break 'em for the other moms.

05:52.041 --> 05:54.959
The moms who followed the rules
would get pissed.

05:55.041 --> 05:59.500
I'd have to get pissy right back and
I don't have time to read my magazine.

05:59.583 --> 06:02.041
See how that works?

06:03.083 --> 06:06.875
I hope some day
you have lots of children.

06:09.333 --> 06:14.667
Hello? Hey, Susan. I can't talk.
I'm in the middle of something here...

06:16.166 --> 06:18.583
What?

06:27.250 --> 06:31.417
- I had a wonderful time today.
- Thank you. I did too.

06:37.458 --> 06:40.375
- I'm sorry I can't invite you in.
- I get it.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.333
Rex still lives in the house.
It would be awkward.

06:43.417 --> 06:46.875
And I would rather cut off my hand
than hurt his feelings.

06:49.625 --> 06:54.333
It'll be a lot easier
once he gets well enough to move out.

06:54.417 --> 06:57.250
So do you want to have lunch tomorrow?

07:00.125 --> 07:02.959
I'd love to.

07:05.834 --> 07:08.709
- Pick me up at one.
- I'll see you then.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.083
Packages.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.291
Thank you.

07:19.792 --> 07:21.834
Hello?

07:21.959 --> 07:24.041
Hi, Lynette.

07:26.041 --> 07:28.125
What?

07:33.500 --> 07:36.750
Hi, honey. Welcome home.

07:42.583 --> 07:44.625
Thanks, guys.

07:44.709 --> 07:46.834
Take it easy.

07:52.041 --> 07:54.250
Come on, honey. Let's celebrate.

07:54.333 --> 07:57.041
Sorry it's the cheap stuff.
I had to economize.

07:57.125 --> 08:00.041
Now you're back
we can restock the wine cellar.

08:00.834 --> 08:04.083
- Let's toast.
- It's very good to be back.

08:04.166 --> 08:06.250
What's that?

08:07.834 --> 08:12.959
It transmits to this,
my electronic monitoring device.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.709
- Didn't the lawyer tell you?
- Tell me what?

08:15.834 --> 08:18.667
I'm on house arrest.
It's a condition of my bail.

08:18.792 --> 08:22.375
- No, he neglected to tell me that.
- Yeah.

08:22.458 --> 08:26.417
If I move more than 100 feet
from that telephone, an alarm sounds.

08:26.500 --> 08:30.500
If I keep going, it transmits a signal
to the FBI and I'm back in jail.

08:30.583 --> 08:34.375
- But how are you gonna work?
- I can't. I can't do anything.

08:36.083 --> 08:40.125
No, that's unreasonable.
What do they expect us to do for money?

08:40.208 --> 08:44.542
The lawyer's working on unfreezing
the accounts, and in the meantime,

08:44.625 --> 08:46.667
haven't you been modeling?

08:46.750 --> 08:49.125
Carlos, this is not like New York

08:49.250 --> 08:53.250
where I made thousands of dollars a day
modeling <i>haute couture.</i>

08:53.333 --> 08:57.500
I'm doing boat shows.
I spend eight hours a day doing this.

08:58.542 --> 09:01.542
Well, I'd buy two boats from you.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.709
Come on.

09:04.792 --> 09:06.875
Where's my toast?

09:10.125 --> 09:12.875
Welcome home.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.583
Hello? Hi, Bree.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.792
What?

09:25.458 --> 09:29.959
If you find anything of your sister's
that might shed light on her death,

09:30.041 --> 09:33.667
letters or a date book,

09:33.750 --> 09:37.291
please call me immediately.

09:37.375 --> 09:41.542
I believe she did keep a diary
or something. I'll look around for it.

09:45.166 --> 09:47.959
Look at them all. Vultures.

09:48.834 --> 09:52.542
Pretending to care, when all
they want are the sordid details.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.542
I don't know. I think
they just wanna show their support.

09:56.625 --> 10:01.041
Please. Human beings feed on misery.

10:01.166 --> 10:05.291
Well, we might as well
give the people what they want.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.458
Hello. I want to thank you all
for coming out here

10:12.542 --> 10:16.083
and expressing
your genuine sorrow and disbelief.

10:16.166 --> 10:20.709
My sister Martha would've been touched.
I know many of you have questions.

10:20.792 --> 10:25.208
The police are still putting together
the details of what happened.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.583
What they do know is
Martha died a violent death.

10:31.375 --> 10:35.166
Yes, I know, it's hard to hear.

10:35.250 --> 10:38.417
Apparently there was a struggle.

10:38.500 --> 10:42.583
They found scratching and bruising
on her body, several broken bones

10:42.667 --> 10:45.166
and traces of dirt in her lungs,

10:46.667 --> 10:50.583
which leads us to believe she was
still alive at the time of her burial

10:50.667 --> 10:53.291
and probably in great pain.

10:54.875 --> 11:00.667
But the good news is there are no signs
that she had been molested.

11:01.500 --> 11:06.417
Now, I think it's time
that you return to your homes,

11:06.500 --> 11:08.583
to your loved ones.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.792
Oh, in lieu of a memorial service,

11:13.875 --> 11:16.792
I'll be holding an estate sale
day after tomorrow.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.750
Please, no personal checks.

11:29.375 --> 11:32.667
<i>By the next morning,</i>
<i>everyone on Wisteria Lane</i>

11:32.750 --> 11:38.583
<i>was aware of Martha Huber's demise,</i>
<i>with no exceptions.</i>

11:38.667 --> 11:41.041
OK, boys. You see this gum?

11:41.125 --> 11:45.709
If you promise to be quiet while
I am playing cards, it's all yours.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.625
- Deal?
- Yeah.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.583
That's what I like to hear.

11:50.709 --> 11:55.291
What are the odds? First Mary Alice
and then Mrs. Huber? It's shocking.

11:55.375 --> 11:58.917
This is different.
Someone was murdered on our street.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.834
I talked to her
right before she disappeared.

12:01.917 --> 12:06.291
- What did you talk about?
- She yelled about my garbage cans.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.500
I'm gonna miss her.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.875
- Edie.
- Hi.

12:12.959 --> 12:17.166
- Hi. Come on in.
- You're all here.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.125
Yeah. Tuesday is poker day.

12:20.208 --> 12:24.917
Really? You know, I love poker.

12:29.709 --> 12:31.834
OK, then.

12:31.917 --> 12:34.000
Well, here's the deal.

12:34.083 --> 12:38.041
Since the ice queen isn't doing
anything to memorialize her sister,

12:38.125 --> 12:40.875
I have decided to carry Martha's ashes

12:40.959 --> 12:44.583
up to Torch Lake
and scatter them myself.

12:44.667 --> 12:48.333
- It's where her husband proposed.
- That's so sweet.

12:49.959 --> 12:55.542
I know. So I thought that some of the
neighbors could caravan up there

12:55.625 --> 12:58.959
and we'd have a little ceremony.

12:59.083 --> 13:03.750
I've printed out maps if anyone needs
one, and the dress is semi-formal.

13:03.834 --> 13:09.208
I'd love to go, but I just got back
into modeling, just for fun.

13:09.291 --> 13:12.083
I have a gig tomorrow.
I can't leave 'em hanging.

13:12.166 --> 13:17.792
- I would have arranged a sitter.
- I have to take Rex to his angiogram.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.250
Well, Mayer, what's your excuse?

13:29.667 --> 13:33.166
I'm just, you know, busy. Stuff.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.917
Well, your friends
are much better liars.

13:44.667 --> 13:47.959
OK. Mommy's friends are gone now
and you can...

13:55.458 --> 13:57.542
Well, yeah, I know it hurts.

13:57.625 --> 14:02.000
That's what you get when you let your
brothers put bubble gum in your hair:

14:02.083 --> 14:03.959
pain and misery.

14:04.041 --> 14:07.709
- Are you mad at me?
- Yes, I am mad at you.

14:09.834 --> 14:13.709
And I'm also cranky, like you get
when you haven't taken a nap.

14:13.792 --> 14:16.792
Mommies are the same way.
We need our downtime.

14:16.875 --> 14:19.667
If we don't get it... Sorry.

14:19.750 --> 14:23.834
...we end up saying and doing things
which we don't normally do.

14:23.917 --> 14:28.000
And that's frustrating 'cause I do
want to be the best mommy I can be.

14:28.083 --> 14:31.250
I think you're the best mommy
in the world.

14:32.542 --> 14:36.792
Well, that's sweet of you,
but it's not exactly true.

14:42.458 --> 14:46.417
I was so afraid when I suggested
a picnic that you'd make fun of me,

14:46.500 --> 14:51.250
but it's such a lovely, old-fashioned
way to spend an afternoon.

14:51.375 --> 14:54.667
Well, as it happens,
I'm an old-fashioned kind of guy.

14:54.750 --> 14:58.500
And we got so lucky with the weather.
It's just absolutely...

15:02.041 --> 15:05.917
Your lunch hour's almost up. We should
get you back to the pharmacy.

15:06.000 --> 15:09.458
Wait. I've had such a good time
these last few days.

15:09.583 --> 15:13.709
- I just wanna show my appreciation.
- I hope it's not another orchid.

15:13.792 --> 15:17.875
- They're so expensive.
- Relax. This didn't cost me a dime.

15:26.458 --> 15:29.250
George, you shouldn't have.

15:32.875 --> 15:38.041
This is a nine-millimeter Luger PO8.

15:38.125 --> 15:41.500
When you said you were in the NRA,
I wanted to give it to you.

15:41.583 --> 15:44.166
I can't accept this. It's too valuable.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.458
It's OK. My grandpa left it to me.

15:47.542 --> 15:51.250
It was surrendered to him
by a soldier during World War II.

15:51.333 --> 15:55.709
- Since I don't know how to shoot...
- It's so lovely. Look at that handle.

15:55.792 --> 15:59.166
- Mother-of-pearl?
- Only the officers' models had that.

15:59.250 --> 16:03.125
- Do you really like it?
- Absolutely.

16:03.208 --> 16:08.417
George, this is just
so much better than an orchid.

16:19.291 --> 16:23.250
Hi. I'm Susan Mayer.
I thought you might need a hand.

16:23.333 --> 16:25.250
No, thanks.

16:26.834 --> 16:29.500
I'm sorry for what happened.

16:29.583 --> 16:34.458
It must be really hard
not knowing who did it or why.

16:34.542 --> 16:37.625
- You must feel helpless.
- A bit.

16:37.709 --> 16:41.583
I'm hoping her journals
will provide some insight.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.709
- Journals?
- Yes. Martha kept them for years.

16:46.709 --> 16:50.125
So she must have written
a lot of things in them?

16:50.208 --> 16:54.875
Every mundane detail of her life.

16:54.959 --> 16:58.166
And everyone else's, for that matter.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.792
The police want to see them,

17:00.875 --> 17:06.125
but I'm stalling them till I have
a chance to read through them myself.

17:06.208 --> 17:10.542
Wouldn't want any embarrassing
family secrets getting out.

17:10.625 --> 17:14.834
That's smart. That's good.
That's good to hear.

17:20.083 --> 17:23.667
- I am so screwed.
- Mom, calm down.

17:23.750 --> 17:27.917
Everything about the fire and measuring
cup is gonna be in that journal.

17:28.000 --> 17:30.083
Everyone'll think I'm an arsonist.

17:30.166 --> 17:32.542
It may not be as bad as it looks.

17:32.625 --> 17:35.250
There's a chance
she didn't write about it?

17:35.333 --> 17:38.583
Please. It's great dirt.
I even put it in my journal.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.458
You're gonna have to convince Mrs. Britt
it was an accident.

17:43.542 --> 17:46.667
If she doesn't press charges,
the police'll let it go.

17:46.750 --> 17:49.208
Are you high? Edie hates me.

17:49.291 --> 17:53.667
That's why you're going to grovel
at her feet and beg forgiveness.

17:53.750 --> 17:57.333
That's right. You're gonna have to
suck up to Edie Britt.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.709
<i>Hey, Mike. As you can probably see</i>
<i>by now, I took back my money</i>

18:28.792 --> 18:33.125
<i>and what little information you managed</i>
<i>to dig up on your neighbors.</i>

18:33.208 --> 18:37.792
<i>Your replacement's gonna need it.</i>
<i>Pack up and move on with your life.</i>

18:37.959 --> 18:40.125
<i>Sorry for the mess.</i>

18:47.333 --> 18:50.291
We're here. Ten minutes early.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.959
- Sign me up.
- You just missed the rush. Sorry.

18:53.041 --> 18:58.333
No, I planned ahead.
We're ten minutes early.

18:59.333 --> 19:01.333
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:01.458 --> 19:04.375
When you said you had
a sick child, I had no idea.

19:04.458 --> 19:06.959
How long's it been?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.333
Just kinda snuck up on us.

19:12.417 --> 19:16.542
And he's so young, too.
God, it just breaks my heart.

19:19.542 --> 19:23.333
- No, see, here's the thing...
- You go ahead into class.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.417
I'll find room for your kids.

19:36.959 --> 19:40.750
I gotta say, I envy you.

19:41.834 --> 19:43.917
In the name of God, why?

19:44.000 --> 19:48.166
Well, you get to build
your dream house, for free.

19:48.250 --> 19:52.750
In a weird way your house burning down
was really a good thing.

19:52.875 --> 19:55.125
There is nothing good about it.

19:55.208 --> 19:58.917
I can't replace the memories,
the photographs, the...

19:59.000 --> 20:01.750
Is there something you want?

20:03.375 --> 20:06.125
OK, here's the deal, Edie.

20:10.917 --> 20:13.458
What?
Spit it out already. I'm busy.

20:15.291 --> 20:18.375
I just wanted to see
how you were holding up.

20:18.458 --> 20:21.000
You know, with Mrs. Huber
and everything.

20:21.083 --> 20:25.250
My best friend was murdered
and stuffed into a garbage bag,

20:25.417 --> 20:27.458
and nobody cares enough to

20:29.458 --> 20:32.166
go with me to spread her ashes.

20:34.875 --> 20:37.166
I'll go with you, Edie.

20:47.625 --> 20:50.000
Thank God. I'm starving.

20:50.125 --> 20:53.291
Well, dig in.
I am way too tired to eat.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.834
I'm sorry.

21:07.208 --> 21:10.959
So did you get to go by the hospital,
visit Mama?

21:11.083 --> 21:13.917
I worked ten hours today.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.959
I'll go tomorrow.
She doesn't know when I'm there.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.750
She's gonna wake up soon. I know it.

21:21.083 --> 21:23.333
And you know what'd make her happy?

21:23.458 --> 21:25.875
If you say a grandchild, so help me.

21:25.959 --> 21:28.875
- Gabrielle, please.
- You promised. No babies.

21:28.959 --> 21:31.750
- Things change.
- Yeah, I know.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.667
The Feds towed away my Maserati,
my husband is a felon,

21:35.750 --> 21:40.500
and I spend my days getting groped
by fat tractor salesmen at trade shows.

21:40.583 --> 21:45.417
- I am well aware things change.
- A baby is solid, a constant.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.625
Who's gonna change diapers when you're
pumping iron in a federal prison?

21:51.041 --> 21:54.208
I like my lifestyle
and I don't want you to kill it.

21:54.333 --> 21:57.000
Well, look around. It's already dead.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.250
Now there's nothing you can control.

21:59.333 --> 22:04.917
Maybe. But having a baby?
That I can control. You, I can control.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.291
You can't talk to me like that.
I'm the man of this house.

22:08.375 --> 22:11.750
Really? The man of the house?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.667
Don't walk away from me.

22:16.583 --> 22:20.583
My food.
Gabrielle, come back here right now.

22:22.875 --> 22:27.291
I wouldn't go too much farther.
You're gonna end up back in prison.

22:27.375 --> 22:30.750
Dammit, Gabrielle. Get inside now.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.250
- I waited all day for that.
- It's perfect.

22:44.125 --> 22:49.542
Crispy and burnt on the outside,
but nice and steamy on the inside.

22:58.625 --> 23:01.917
You're the man of the house?
You can't even leave it.

23:16.458 --> 23:20.291
I love this. It's like an adventure.
I've never fired a gun before.

23:20.417 --> 23:23.750
The memory of this night
will stay with you for ever.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.667
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

23:25.750 --> 23:31.458
You always remember your first time.
I hope I brought enough bullets.

23:31.542 --> 23:36.959
You know, Bree, I can't tell you what
these last few days have meant to me.

23:37.041 --> 23:40.250
Finally getting out of the house
and trying new things.

23:40.333 --> 23:43.542
- Well, we sure have had some fun.
- It's more than that.

23:44.709 --> 23:46.875
I forget what it's like to be lonely.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.709
Oh, George, that's so sweet.

23:50.792 --> 23:53.792
Now, come on.
Let's go shoot something.

23:53.917 --> 23:58.542
Before I fire a handgun, I go over
the basics to make sure I'm ready.

23:58.625 --> 24:02.917
OK? So, number one. Strong stance.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.834
Two. High hand grasp.

24:05.917 --> 24:08.208
Three. Hard grip.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.500
Four. Front sight.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.125
Five. Release the safety,

24:13.208 --> 24:16.500
and then squeeze the trigger slowly.

24:16.625 --> 24:21.417
- What's a high hand grasp?
- Here, take the gun.

24:21.500 --> 24:23.583
When you're firing a semiautomatic,

24:23.667 --> 24:28.333
you want the web of your hand
up against the edge of the backstrap.

24:28.417 --> 24:32.041
- What perfume are you wearing?
- I'm not wearing perfume.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.709
Are you sure?
Because you smell amazing.

24:34.834 --> 24:38.125
Oh. I was making macaroons
before I left the house.

24:38.208 --> 24:43.041
Now, I want you to hold the gun like
you're holding a beautiful white dove,

24:43.166 --> 24:47.417
firmly enough that it can't fly away,
but not so firmly that you can kill it.

24:47.542 --> 24:50.667
- Got it?
- I think so.

24:50.792 --> 24:55.959
Now all you have to do is take a
deep breath and squeeze the trigger...

24:56.041 --> 24:58.083
George.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.250
My God.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.375
Sorry.

25:19.917 --> 25:22.166
I'm so sorry you lost your toe.

25:22.250 --> 25:26.625
The doctor said it's the middle one,
so your balance shouldn't be affected.

25:26.709 --> 25:29.875
This really won't change your life
one little bit.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.166
Please say something.

25:35.667 --> 25:40.125
I've always dreamed that before I died

25:40.250 --> 25:44.583
I would get to kiss
a truly beautiful woman.

25:44.667 --> 25:49.417
I finally get the chance
and I end up blowing off a toe.

25:50.875 --> 25:56.375
I'm not surprised. This type of thing
always happens to me.

25:56.458 --> 25:58.750
I know I'll get over it.

26:00.166 --> 26:03.834
But the thing that I don't think
I'll ever get over

26:03.917 --> 26:08.250
is that when I did kiss you,
you pulled away from me.

26:12.792 --> 26:16.834
- Why did you do that, Bree?
- I was just caught off-guard.

26:16.917 --> 26:21.750
But we're dating. Why would it be
so surprising I would try to kiss you?

26:21.834 --> 26:26.709
I'm still married to Rex.
We're not even legally separated yet.

26:26.834 --> 26:30.291
He cheated on you. You said
you were gonna hate him for ever.

26:31.250 --> 26:36.166
You shouldn't listen to a woman
who's just had her heart broken.

26:36.250 --> 26:39.125
We tend to lie.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.875
I think we're a little late. Hi. Sorry.

26:52.709 --> 26:56.667
<i>Lynette knew serious illness</i>
<i>was not a matter to be treated lightly.</i>

26:56.792 --> 27:00.709
- What are you doing?
- Picking up my sick little baby boy.

27:00.792 --> 27:03.083
All right, here. There. OK.

27:03.166 --> 27:06.917
<i>But making her yoga class</i>
<i>was a matter of life and death.</i>

27:07.000 --> 27:10.583
Sorry. Excuse me.

27:10.667 --> 27:13.750
Hey, Lauren. Hi.
We had a really rough morning.

27:13.834 --> 27:16.583
Don't give it another thought.

27:20.583 --> 27:23.083
I bet you were a cheerleader
in high school.

27:23.166 --> 27:25.667
My junior year. How'd you know?

27:25.750 --> 27:28.250
Girls like you
were always cheerleaders.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.417
Clear skin, honor roll, popular.

27:31.500 --> 27:34.583
In high school I was the girl
that hung with the freaks

27:34.667 --> 27:37.208
on the loading dock and smoked.

27:37.333 --> 27:40.709
- Everyone hated us.
- Well, you know high school.

27:40.834 --> 27:45.291
- Thank God we leave that behind.
- See, I don't think we do.

27:45.375 --> 27:49.333
I'm still the outsider that doesn't
get invited to the cool parties,

27:49.417 --> 27:51.875
and you're still the perky cheerleader

27:52.000 --> 27:55.375
who thinks that she can pull the wool
over everyone's eyes.

27:55.458 --> 27:56.625
What?

27:56.709 --> 27:58.959
You came on this trip,
paid for the gas,

27:59.041 --> 28:02.458
and you're changing this flat
when you know I have Auto Club.

28:02.542 --> 28:05.834
You want something from me.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.792
I just know Mrs. Huber's death's
been hard on you. I want to help.

28:09.875 --> 28:13.959
- That's a lie.
- Why would you think I was lying?

28:14.041 --> 28:17.959
Because we're still in high school.
The old rules apply.

28:18.041 --> 28:21.667
The cool kids only talk to the freaks
when they need something.

28:21.750 --> 28:26.041
You're not getting back in my car until
you tell me what it is that you want.

28:32.375 --> 28:34.208
Look, I...

28:36.125 --> 28:40.166
I just haven't always treated you well
and I wanna make amends.

28:43.250 --> 28:47.709
I still think you're full of crap,
but we don't have time to debate this.

28:53.291 --> 28:56.291
I would have talked to you
in high school.

28:56.375 --> 29:01.125
Of all the lies you've told,
that's the worst.

29:21.709 --> 29:23.959
Single malt?

29:25.291 --> 29:28.834
- Have a seat. Take a load off.
- I want it all back.

29:28.959 --> 29:31.041
My maps, pictures, my gun.

29:31.125 --> 29:33.834
- And the money.
- My money, you mean?

29:33.959 --> 29:37.875
You'll never get somebody who cares
about finding Deirdre like I do.

29:37.959 --> 29:43.375
Why? Because you loved her so much?
You abandoned her, remember?

29:43.458 --> 29:47.875
You saved yourself, found a nice, safe
wife and you left my daughter to rot.

29:48.000 --> 29:52.208
So forgive me if I question
your level of commitment.

29:54.625 --> 29:57.917
I need to do this.
Why are you fighting me?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.750
You haven't been moving fast enough,
and I'm running out of time.

30:01.875 --> 30:05.250
- What do you mean?
- It seems I have a tumor.

30:07.208 --> 30:09.834
Apparently it's pressing on my brain.

30:13.166 --> 30:15.291
I'm gonna die,

30:15.375 --> 30:19.500
and I'd like to know what happened
to my daughter before I do.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.917
That was the best class ever.

30:29.000 --> 30:33.458
- I just feel terrific. Thank you.
- Lynette, this is my friend Callie.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.667
- She wanted to meet Parker.
- Really? Why?

30:38.875 --> 30:42.458
I'm a survivor. Breast cancer.
About six years ago.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.709
Can I hug your son?

30:47.083 --> 30:49.208
Sure.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.250
I know exactly
what you're going through.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.875
But you're gonna be brave, OK?

30:58.000 --> 31:02.083
And you are gonna survive this
because you are a tough little soldier.

31:09.083 --> 31:12.000
Mommy, am I dying?

31:23.291 --> 31:28.542
No. You're not dying. People just
think that because I shaved your head.

31:28.625 --> 31:33.083
- You shaved his head?
- My brothers put gum in my hair.

31:36.583 --> 31:39.208
Sorry. Excuse me.

31:39.291 --> 31:44.166
<i>And just like that, Lynette realized</i>
<i>the road to enlightenment</i>

31:44.250 --> 31:48.458
<i>and spiritual well-being</i>
<i>was now closed to her.</i>

31:56.500 --> 31:58.375
Well, what a surprise.

31:58.458 --> 32:04.375
See, I've been doing a lot of thinking
since we talked at the hospital, and...

32:05.041 --> 32:08.875
- And?
- Bree, I don't care what we call it.

32:08.959 --> 32:11.792
We can call it dating.
We can call it hanging out.

32:11.917 --> 32:18.750
I just want to be with you.
See, I really need our friendship back.

32:19.834 --> 32:23.375
- I don't think that would be wise.
- Why not?

32:23.500 --> 32:29.291
Wouldn't you keep hoping that in time
I would feel the same way about you?

32:31.125 --> 32:33.208
Maybe.

32:33.834 --> 32:34.875
Oh, George.

32:34.959 --> 32:38.041
I wish you wouldn't say
"Oh, George" like that,

32:38.166 --> 32:41.250
like I'm pathetic for even thinking
you could love me.

32:41.375 --> 32:47.500
I don't think you're pathetic.
It's just that I can't.

32:50.417 --> 32:53.542
Aw, jeez.

32:53.625 --> 32:57.458
George, please don't go.
Why can't we talk this over?

32:57.542 --> 32:59.667
Don't.

32:59.750 --> 33:03.417
- Oh, my God. Oh, George, here...
- Get away from me.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.709
- Lean on me.
- I don't need you.

33:06.792 --> 33:09.417
I don't need anybody.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.667
You know, honey, tonight's
the last night of the boat show.

33:17.792 --> 33:21.959
We can spend some time together
before the home and garden thing.

33:23.375 --> 33:24.709
Carlos?

33:24.792 --> 33:28.750
I'm going to jail, and you're not gonna
be here when I get back.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.375
- What?
- It's true, and I won't blame you.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.709
Don't talk like that.
Everything's gonna be fine.

33:35.834 --> 33:39.625
We're gonna sort this mess out
and you're gonna be back on top.

33:39.709 --> 33:44.208
They could find me guilty.
I could go to prison for five years.

33:44.291 --> 33:47.500
We'd have to sell the house.
You'd have to keep working.

33:47.583 --> 33:51.834
If that happens,
can you promise you won't ever leave?

33:55.041 --> 33:57.583
I promise.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.041
I gotta go.

34:07.917 --> 34:09.959
This is far enough.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.500
Do you need help with the container?

34:25.625 --> 34:28.417
No, I got it open. I'm good.

34:34.166 --> 34:37.083
So what are you waiting for?

34:37.166 --> 34:39.458
I just need a moment, OK?

34:39.542 --> 34:43.041
Of course. Take your time.

34:52.959 --> 34:55.375
Are you OK?

34:55.458 --> 34:57.917
No, I'm just so grateful.

34:59.667 --> 35:03.667
I know.
Mrs. Huber was a good friend to you.

35:04.291 --> 35:06.709
I'm not talking about Martha.

35:08.000 --> 35:11.709
- I'm grateful to you.
- Me?

35:11.792 --> 35:16.667
Yeah, I've been such a bitch
to you over the years,

35:16.792 --> 35:22.000
and here you are
rowing me out to dump her ashes.

35:23.291 --> 35:26.417
Well, it's really no big deal.

35:26.500 --> 35:31.750
Yes, it is. You stepped up
when nobody else would,

35:31.834 --> 35:34.834
and here I am thinking
you have an ulterior motive.

35:37.959 --> 35:42.041
Susan, you're such a good person.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.250
And I'm such a bitch.

35:46.583 --> 35:50.125
Edie, you're not that bad,
and, believe me, I'm not that good.

35:50.208 --> 35:54.166
- Yes, you are.
- Please don't do this.

35:54.291 --> 35:57.000
And Martha may be gone,

35:57.083 --> 36:00.875
but the good Lord above
has shown me that I'm not alone.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.333
I am so grateful
that I still have a true friend.

36:09.291 --> 36:11.375
Thank you, Susan.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.250
Edie, I burned your house down.

36:15.792 --> 36:20.375
I was scared you were sleeping
with Mike and so I let myself in.

36:20.458 --> 36:24.125
I accidentally knocked a candle over
and the whole... just...

36:24.208 --> 36:29.041
I'm so sorry. Can you ever forgive me?

36:42.166 --> 36:45.417
Row me back now.

36:52.291 --> 36:55.417
I'm sorry about before, shoving you.
I didn't mean...

36:55.500 --> 36:57.583
I'm not gonna break.

36:59.041 --> 37:01.583
I'm sorry, too.

37:01.709 --> 37:04.834
Questioning your commitment, your guts.

37:04.917 --> 37:09.375
- I know better than that.
- Yeah, you should.

37:11.166 --> 37:16.000
I keep this with me all the time
to remind me why I'm there.

37:17.625 --> 37:20.417
If it turns out someone hurt her,
I want them dead.

37:20.542 --> 37:23.458
We need to be sure
before we do anything.

37:23.542 --> 37:28.542
When you're sure, I know
I can trust you to take care of it.

37:28.667 --> 37:33.417
After all,
you already killed for her once.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.917
Yeah, is this the pharmacy?

38:08.000 --> 38:11.792
My wife asked me to call.
She lost her prescription.

38:11.875 --> 38:15.583
Gabrielle Solis.
Yeah, the birth-control pills.

38:17.000 --> 38:22.166
Great, great. She'll be very relieved.
Can she get enough for a couple months?

38:24.125 --> 38:26.500
That's right. Better safe than sorry.

38:26.625 --> 38:30.166
Thanks a lot. Oh, do you guys deliver?

38:40.959 --> 38:43.041
Edie, please talk to me.

38:47.166 --> 38:50.583
I've been thinking about this
for the last 90 miles

38:50.667 --> 38:53.625
and you don't have to forgive me.

38:53.709 --> 38:58.375
You can go to the police, kick me,
you can burn my house down.

38:58.458 --> 39:02.625
You just have to know
that I am so racked with guilt,

39:02.709 --> 39:08.208
I don't think it's possible for me
to suffer any more than I am already.

39:08.291 --> 39:12.041
Boy, I'd like to put
that theory to the test.

39:16.375 --> 39:20.041
Well, whatever you want to do, Edie.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.750
Just know that I'm sorry.

39:31.709 --> 39:33.959
I'm not going to the police.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.125
- You're not?
- No.

39:37.208 --> 39:41.041
The insurance company will investigate
and it'll delay my check.

39:41.125 --> 39:43.875
- Thank you.
- But...

39:47.083 --> 39:50.125
...there is something
I want you to do for me.

39:50.208 --> 39:53.500
Of course. Anything.
You name it. What?

39:53.583 --> 39:56.208
I want to be invited
to your poker game.

39:56.291 --> 39:59.375
- Our poker games?
- I'm not saying I'll go.

39:59.458 --> 40:03.333
And I'm not saying you and your
little friends have to be nice to me,

40:03.417 --> 40:08.166
but every once in a while, yeah,
it would be nice to be asked.

40:09.458 --> 40:15.208
We meet on Tuesdays. And it's pot-luck
lunch. Everybody brings something.

40:15.291 --> 40:18.291
- I'm not bringing anything.
- You don't have to.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.583
Well, this is good.

40:22.792 --> 40:24.875
Thank you.

40:26.083 --> 40:31.959
I guess I should go take a shower
and wash Mrs. Huber off me.

40:33.125 --> 40:34.583
Hold it.

40:34.667 --> 40:40.542
I can't stand the thought of Martha's
ashes going down some sewer drain.

40:41.875 --> 40:45.375
Well, Edie, I have to clean up.

40:45.458 --> 40:48.917
Well, this is such a beautiful lawn.

40:49.000 --> 40:51.667
We could put her to rest right here.

40:51.750 --> 40:55.208
- On my front lawn?
- Why not?

40:55.291 --> 40:58.000
She can spend eternity
looking at her house

40:58.083 --> 41:00.542
and keep an eye on the neighborhood.

41:00.667 --> 41:02.834
She'd like that.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.083
Stand over here. I'll hose you off.

41:07.458 --> 41:10.542
I don't think so.

41:10.625 --> 41:13.125
You owe me.

41:20.834 --> 41:24.041
Martha, I'm gonna miss you.

41:41.417 --> 41:43.875
<i>Death is inevitable.</i>

41:43.959 --> 41:47.458
<i>It's a promise</i>
<i>made to each of us at birth.</i>

41:47.542 --> 41:49.875
<i>But before that promise is kept,</i>

41:50.000 --> 41:53.333
<i>we all hope</i>
<i>something will happen to us.</i>

41:55.583 --> 41:58.500
<i>Whether it's the thrill of romance,</i>

42:01.250 --> 42:03.333
<i>the joy of raising a family,...</i>

42:03.417 --> 42:06.291
I'm gonna get you.

42:06.375 --> 42:09.291
<i>...or the anguish of great loss,</i>

42:11.542 --> 42:16.875
<i>we all hope to experience something</i>
<i>that makes our lives meaningful.</i>

42:21.250 --> 42:25.583
<i>But the sad fact is</i>
<i>not all lives have meaning.</i>

42:27.583 --> 42:32.625
<i>Some people spend their time on this</i>
<i>planet just sitting on the sidelines</i>

42:35.125 --> 42:38.250
<i>waiting for something</i>
<i>to happen to them</i>

42:39.583 --> 42:42.291
<i>before it's too late.</i>
