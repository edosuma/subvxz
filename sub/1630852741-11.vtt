00:19.166 --> 00:21.266

00:21.266 --> 00:24.066
AND THEN MADE A DEAL WITH THEIR

Announcer: TODD WITH HIS

01:46.567 --> 01:48.100

01:48.100 --> 01:50.700

LAMAR AND TODRICK. OK.

01:57.834 --> 01:59.433
OK.

01:59.433 --> 02:03.667
Announcer: TURNING LAMAR AND

02:03.667 --> 02:05.834
TODRICK INTO A HUMAN MOJITO.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.734
WE'RE GOING TO BE THE MOJITO

02:08.734 --> 02:09.400
AND LIME FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

02:09.400 --> 02:12.500
Announcer: CARSON AND CYNTHIA

02:12.500 --> 02:14.166
WERE THE OBVIOUS TARGETS.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.667
THIS WOULDN'T BE RIGHT.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.300
BOTTOM LINE IS I'M DOING

02:17.300 --> 02:18.233
WHAT'S BEST FOR TODD.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.600
Announcer: TODD WANTED TO PUT

02:19.600 --> 02:21.600
UP A PAWN.

02:21.600 --> 02:22.800
YOU DON'T MIND BEING A PAWN,

02:22.800 --> 02:23.033
LAMAR?

02:23.033 --> 02:24.600
NO.

02:24.600 --> 02:25.633
WHY WOULD TODD BRIDGES BE

02:25.633 --> 02:26.867
SAVING CYNTHIA FROM THE BLOCK

02:26.867 --> 02:28.133
WHO HE HAS BEEN FIGHTING WITH

02:28.133 --> 02:30.667
THE PAST FEW WEEKS?

02:30.667 --> 02:32.367
COULD IT BE STRATEGY?

02:32.367 --> 02:33.967
TRYING TO SECURE VOTES SHOULD HE

02:33.967 --> 02:37.600
END UP IN THE FINAL TWO CHAIRS.

02:37.600 --> 02:39.033
I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON.

02:39.033 --> 02:40.900
Announcer: AFTER CARSON AND

02:40.900 --> 02:42.767
CYNTHIA LEARNED THEY WEREN'T

02:42.767 --> 02:44.367
BOTH GOING ON THE BLOCK.
YOU REALIZE I HAVE TO PUT YOU

02:44.367 --> 02:45.000
YOU REALIZE I HAVE TO PUT YOU UP.

02:45.000 --> 02:45.266
UP.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.500
YES.
I DON'T WANT TO PUT CYNTHIA

02:46.500 --> 02:46.734
I DON'T WANT TO PUT CYNTHIA UP.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.467
UP.

02:49.467 --> 02:51.633
I'M GOING TO PUT LAMAR UP.

02:51.633 --> 02:52.967
THERE WAS A RAY OF HOPE THEY

02:52.967 --> 02:54.000
BOTH COULD STAY.

02:54.000 --> 02:54.567
CYNTHIA WERE MEANT TO BE IN

02:54.567 --> 02:57.200
THIS HOUSE TOGETHER.

02:57.200 --> 03:01.433
THIS LAST MINUTE MANOEUVRE MIGHT
JUST BE THE HAIL MARY THAT WE

03:01.433 --> 03:01.767
JUST BE THE HAIL MARY THAT WE NEED.

03:01.767 --> 03:03.800
NEED.

03:03.800 --> 03:04.100
Announcer: AT THE NOMINATION

03:04.100 --> 03:08.066
CEREMONY ...

03:08.066 --> 03:09.867
I HAVE NOMINATED YOU CO CARSN

Announcer: THEY HIT THE BLOCK.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.967
BLOCK.

03:12.967 --> 03:13.967
THERE'S HOPE BECAUSE CYNTHIA

03:13.967 --> 03:14.834
COULD WIN THE VETO.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.400
PULL ME DOWN.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.867
PUT SOMEONE FROM THE OTHER TEAM

03:18.867 --> 03:21.066

03:21.066 --> 03:22.667

BREAK POWER OF VETO WILL BE PLAYED.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.166
PLAYED.

03:25.166 --> 03:26.100
WILL IT SAVE ONE OF THE

03:26.100 --> 03:28.066
NOMINEES?
ANOTHER CELEBRITY WILL BE

03:28.066 --> 03:29.567
ANOTHER CELEBRITY WILL BE EVICTED.

03:29.567 --> 03:32.233
EVICTED.

03:32.233 --> 03:35.567
PLUS, HOLLYWOOD STAR AND BB

03:35.567 --> 03:36.667
SUPER FAN JERRY O'CONNELL GIVES

03:36.667 --> 03:39.300

03:39.300 --> 03:41.667

03:41.667 --> 03:48.133
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER!

03:48.133 --> 03:58.166
BOTTOMS UP!

04:23.800 --> 04:27.700
Julie: GOOD EVENING, I'M

04:27.700 --> 04:29.200
JULIE CHEN MOONVES.
WELCOME TO CELEBRITY BIG

04:29.200 --> 04:29.967
WELCOME TO CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

04:29.967 --> 04:32.166
BROTHER.

04:32.166 --> 04:35.166
IT HAS BEEN A WEEK OF SURPRISES

04:35.166 --> 04:36.600
INSIDE THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.700
FIRST, TODD THREW A MONKEY

04:38.700 --> 04:41.333
WRENCH INTO CARSON AND CYNTHIA'S
PLAN BY WINNING HEAD OF

04:41.333 --> 04:41.600
PLAN BY WINNING HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD.

04:41.600 --> 04:44.266
HOUSEHOLD.

04:44.266 --> 04:46.266
BUT, HE GAVE THEM A GLIMMER OF

04:46.266 --> 04:47.633
HOPE WHEN HE DIDN'T PUT BOTH OF

04:47.633 --> 04:49.300
THEM ON THE BLOCK.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.934
TONIGHT, EVERYTHING HINGES ON

04:51.934 --> 04:53.834
WHO WINS THE VETO.

04:53.834 --> 04:55.500
IF CYNTHIA CAN WIN IT, SHE WILL

04:55.500 --> 04:58.200
NO DOUBT SAVE CARSON LEAVING THE
DUO IN PLACE TO FIGHT ANOTHER

04:58.200 --> 04:59.633
DUO IN PLACE TO FIGHT ANOTHER DAY.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.467
DAY.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.033
SO, WHO WILL WIN THE GOLDEN

05:03.033 --> 05:04.967
POWER OF VETO?

05:04.967 --> 05:06.300
AND WHO WILL COME UP SHORT OF

05:06.300 --> 05:07.033
WINNING THE QUARTER MILLION

05:07.033 --> 05:09.600
DOLLAR GRAND PRIZE?

05:09.600 --> 05:13.633
WE'LL FIND OUT LIVE TONIGHT.

05:13.633 --> 05:15.533
BUT FIRST, SOME ARE TRYING TO

05:15.533 --> 05:18.333
SAVE THEIR GAME WHILE OTHERS ARE

05:18.333 --> 05:20.233
LOOKING TO WIN IT.
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS

05:20.233 --> 05:21.166
THIS NOMINATION CEREMONY IS ADJOURNED.

05:21.166 --> 05:25.700
ADJOURNED.

05:26.967 --> 05:29.600
DEJA VU AROUND HERE.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.166
I NOMINATED CARSON AND LAMAR.

05:31.166 --> 05:33.266
I NOMINATED CARSON BECAUSE HE

05:33.266 --> 05:34.100
HAS WON AN HOH AND VETO.

05:34.100 --> 05:36.834
HE'S A BIG THREAT.

05:36.834 --> 05:37.967
HE CAN END UP IN THE TOP TWO.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.100
SO IF I CAN GET CARSON OUT OF

05:40.100 --> 05:42.233
HERE, THAT MAKES MY CHANCES OF

05:42.233 --> 05:47.300
WINNING EVEN HIGHER.

05:47.300 --> 05:51.400
MY BUDDY LAMAR IS A PAWN BECAUSE

05:51.400 --> 05:52.166
ME, TO TODRICK, MIESHA AND LAMAR

05:52.166 --> 05:54.367
ARE WINNING TOGETHER.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.700
OUR PLAN IS TO KEEP THE

05:55.700 --> 05:57.233
NOMINATIONS THE SAME AND VOTE

05:57.233 --> 05:58.633
CARSON OUT.

05:58.633 --> 05:58.900
CAKE?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.567
YES.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.633
I HAVE JUST BEEN NOMINATED
FOR EVICTION FOR A THIRD TIME

06:02.633 --> 06:03.333
FOR EVICTION FOR A THIRD TIME IT.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.734
IT.
APPARENTLY, I'M A TERRIBLE HOUSE

06:05.734 --> 06:05.934
APPARENTLY, I'M A TERRIBLE HOUSE GUEST.

06:05.934 --> 06:09.200
GUEST.
THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO GET RID OF

06:09.200 --> 06:09.367
THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO GET RID OF ME.

06:09.367 --> 06:12.500
ME.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.700
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE OLD.

06:15.700 --> 06:16.900
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF SURVIVING

06:16.900 --> 06:18.533
EVICTION BECAUSE SHOULD CYNTHIA

06:18.533 --> 06:20.266
WIN THE VETO, SHE COULD TAKE ME

06:20.266 --> 06:22.233
DOWN AND THE TWO OF US WOULD

06:22.233 --> 06:24.700
THEN BE SAFE.

06:24.700 --> 06:26.033
SO ALL IS NOT LOST.

06:26.033 --> 06:28.867
WE'RE LIKE IN AN OUTLET MALL.
IT'S NOT AMAZING, BUT IT'S STILL

06:28.867 --> 06:29.367
IT'S NOT AMAZING, BUT IT'S STILL OK.

06:29.367 --> 06:30.900
OK.

06:30.900 --> 06:31.967
TODD, ONLY THE THIRD QUARTER.

06:31.967 --> 06:33.300
I HAVE BEEN A SPORTSMAN ALL

06:33.300 --> 06:34.667
MY LIFE.

06:34.667 --> 06:35.433
I HAVE A COMPETITIVE FIRE THAT

06:35.433 --> 06:39.033
BURNS DEEP.

06:39.033 --> 06:41.533
SO IF I CAN WIN THE VETO, I'LL

06:41.533 --> 06:43.633
TAKE MYSELF DOWN.

06:43.633 --> 06:44.433
AS LONG AS THERE'S TIME ON THE

06:44.433 --> 06:46.100
CLOCK, THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY

06:46.100 --> 06:47.767
TO WIN.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.100
TAKE THE KNIFE OUT OF MY

06:49.100 --> 06:51.600
BACK, TODD.

06:51.600 --> 06:52.700
OUR PLAN WAS TO PICK OFF THE

06:52.700 --> 06:54.533
OPPOSITION ONE BY ONE.
NOW IT'S DOWN TO CARSON AND

06:54.533 --> 06:54.767
NOW IT'S DOWN TO CARSON AND CYNTHIA.

06:54.767 --> 06:56.433
CYNTHIA.

06:56.433 --> 06:58.433
I'M SORRY, CARSON, YOU'RE A

06:58.433 --> 07:00.233
GREAT GUY, BUT AFTER WE WIN THIS
VETO, YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING

07:00.233 --> 07:00.433
VETO, YOU'RE DEFINITELY GOING HOME.

07:00.433 --> 07:01.633
HOME.

07:01.633 --> 07:03.967
LET'S MAKE THE MOST OF OUR
LAST WEEK TOGETHER.

07:03.967 --> 07:04.667
LAST WEEK TOGETHER. SORRY.

07:04.667 --> 07:08.133
SORRY.

07:08.133 --> 07:09.834
CARSON BEING ON THE BLOCK IS

07:09.834 --> 07:11.400
PROBABLY MY WORST NIGHTMARE.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.800
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE MYSELF IN

07:13.800 --> 07:15.967
THE HOUSE WITHOUT CARSON.

07:15.967 --> 07:17.433
HOWEVER, I AM VERY SURPRISED

07:17.433 --> 07:19.233
THAT MY FACE IS NOT UP THERE

07:19.233 --> 07:21.066
WITH CARSON.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.633
WHAT ARE THEY UP TO?

07:22.633 --> 07:23.066
WE DON'T HAVE CILANTRO,

07:23.066 --> 07:24.633
RIGHT?

07:24.633 --> 07:30.433
LET ME CONFIRM.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.066
LET ME FIND RICE.

07:33.066 --> 07:34.633
THIS IS THE HARDEST THING.

07:34.633 --> 07:37.033
I LIKE EVERYONE.

07:37.033 --> 07:37.967
CARSON APPRECIATED THAT.

07:37.967 --> 07:38.834
THE WORST FEELING EVER.

07:38.834 --> 07:39.934
IT'S HORRIBLE.

07:39.934 --> 07:40.633
HE'S SO AMAZING.

07:40.633 --> 07:42.233
HE IS.

07:42.233 --> 07:44.667
HE'S A GREAT GUY.

07:44.667 --> 07:45.667
BUT HE'S GOOD AT EVERYTHING.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.467
I DIDN'T PUT CYNTHIA ON THE

07:47.467 --> 07:49.133
BLOCK BECAUSE I FIGURED I MAY

07:49.133 --> 07:50.533
NEED CYNTHIA LATER ON AND I

07:50.533 --> 07:51.867
FIGURED IF I DO HER A FAVOUR,

07:51.867 --> 07:55.066
SHE CAN DO ME A FAVOUR LATER ON
WITH A JURY VOTE IN CASE I GET

07:55.066 --> 07:55.300
WITH A JURY VOTE IN CASE I GET THERE.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.266
THERE.

07:57.266 --> 07:58.667
WE DON'T HAVE CILANTRO.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.767
IT'S DELICIOUS TOO.

08:00.767 --> 08:02.333
IF CARSON WINS THAT VETO,

08:02.333 --> 08:08.000
UNFORTUNATELY, I'M GOING TO HAVE

08:08.000 --> 08:11.900
TO PUT CYNTHIA UP IN HIS PLACE.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.200
YOU ALL RIGHT?

08:14.200 --> 08:14.500
ME?

08:14.500 --> 08:18.367
YEAH.

08:18.367 --> 08:19.800
I DON'T KNOW.
THE UNIVERSE WORKED IN OUR

08:19.800 --> 08:20.367
THE UNIVERSE WORKED IN OUR FAVOUR.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.700
FAVOUR.
THIS IS A VERY BITTERSWEET

08:22.700 --> 08:22.934
THIS IS A VERY BITTERSWEET MOMENT.

08:22.934 --> 08:25.600
MOMENT.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.834
I LOVE CARSON.
BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY HE'S ON THE

08:28.834 --> 08:29.033
BUT I'M ALSO HAPPY HE'S ON THE BLOCK.

08:29.033 --> 08:30.900
BLOCK.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.166
I'M HOPING OUR SIDE CAN MAINTAIN
POWER AND GET HIM OUT OF THE

08:33.166 --> 08:33.367
POWER AND GET HIM OUT OF THE HOUSE.

08:33.367 --> 08:35.834
HOUSE.

08:35.834 --> 08:37.033
I HOPE HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MORE

08:37.033 --> 08:39.300
TRICKS UP HIS SLEEVE.

08:39.300 --> 08:40.266
WE CANNOT LOSE THE VETO.

08:40.266 --> 08:49.033
WE CAN'T LOSE IT.

08:49.033 --> 08:51.367
LET'S WIN.

08:51.367 --> 08:55.567
18 CHAMPIONSHIPS UP.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.500
MAKES THE DREAM WORK.

09:00.166 --> 09:02.166
CONSIDERING ALL THE GOINGS ON

09:02.166 --> 09:03.266
HAPPENING IN HERE, WE MADE IT

09:03.266 --> 09:04.567
PRETTY FAR.

09:04.567 --> 09:06.967
WE SURE DID.

09:06.967 --> 09:08.266
WITHOUT BEGGING, CAMPAIGNING.
RELATIVELY UNSCATHED.

09:08.266 --> 09:08.867
RELATIVELY UNSCATHED. YEAH.

09:08.867 --> 09:11.033
YEAH.

09:11.033 --> 09:12.633
IT'S A STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS,

09:12.633 --> 09:13.600
BUT THERE'S NO WAY I WOULD

09:13.600 --> 09:15.934
RATHER DO IT.

09:15.934 --> 09:17.233
I HAVE ZERO REGRETS.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.233
CYNTHIA AND I ARE REALLY

09:19.233 --> 09:21.567
PROUD WE PLAYED THIS GAME WITH

09:21.567 --> 09:22.667
INTEGRITY EVERY STEP OF THE WAY.

09:22.667 --> 09:24.400
BUT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY WE

09:24.400 --> 09:27.100
HAVE HAD TO FIGHT TOOTH AND NAIL

09:27.100 --> 09:29.133
TO STAY IN HERE.
LUCKILY OUR TEETH AND NAILS LOOK

09:29.133 --> 09:29.333
LUCKILY OUR TEETH AND NAILS LOOK GREAT.

09:29.333 --> 09:31.367
GREAT.

09:31.367 --> 09:33.333
SO WHAT'S ONE MORE VETO WIN?

09:33.333 --> 09:34.533
COME ON, CYNTHIA!

09:34.533 --> 09:36.934
COME ON!

09:36.934 --> 09:41.500
I'M SHOCKED THEY DIDN'T

09:41.500 --> 09:44.900
FIGURE OUT PUT THE TWO OF US UP.

09:44.900 --> 09:45.734
ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING?

09:45.734 --> 09:47.700
THERE MUST BE A REASON.

09:47.700 --> 09:51.300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE REASON IS.
THIS IS THE CLEAN HOUSE PART.

09:51.300 --> 09:51.467
THIS IS THE CLEAN HOUSE PART. OK.

09:51.467 --> 09:53.233
OK.
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE

09:53.233 --> 09:53.800
EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THE ASSIGNMENT.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.734
ASSIGNMENT.

09:56.734 --> 09:57.767
PUT THEM BOTH UP.

09:57.767 --> 09:59.400
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE
REASONING FOR THIS SMALL

09:59.400 --> 09:59.700
REASONING FOR THIS SMALL BLESSING.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.767
BLESSING.

10:02.767 --> 10:06.100
SLIVER OF HOPE WHEN THEY COULD

10:06.100 --> 10:08.400
HAVE JUST PUT OUR ASSES UP.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.800
IF I WIN THIS VETO, I CAN

10:10.800 --> 10:12.000
TAKE MY BOY CARSON DOWN, SAVE

10:12.000 --> 10:14.800
MYSELF AND THAT WOULD FORCE MY

10:14.800 --> 10:15.667
BOY TODD TO PUT SOMEONE ELSE ON

10:15.667 --> 10:17.266
THE BLOCK.

10:17.266 --> 10:20.500
SUCH AS, OH, WHO IS LEFT?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.200
MIESHA OR TODRICK?

10:23.200 --> 10:25.700
UP ON THE BLOCK WITH LAMAR.
CARSON AND I CAN DECIDE WHO GOES

10:25.700 --> 10:25.900
CARSON AND I CAN DECIDE WHO GOES HOME.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.133
HOME.
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WINNING THE

10:28.133 --> 10:28.633
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO WINNING THE VETO.

10:28.633 --> 10:31.600
VETO.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.200
PUT UP, SHUT UP OR PACK UP.
IT'S DO OR DIE.

10:33.200 --> 10:35.033
IT'S DO OR DIE. YEAH.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.533
YEAH.

10:37.533 --> 10:39.600

10:47.533 --> 10:50.266
DO OR DIE COMPETITION?

SO, DO THEY HAVE A PRAYER TO

11:33.367 --> 11:37.600

11:40.433 --> 11:42.233
MOTHER, MOTHER.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.133
THIS IS STILL RELEVANT TODAY.

11:44.133 --> 11:49.333
IS IT SOMETIMES HARD FOR YOU

11:49.333 --> 11:50.433
TO BELIEVE YOUR MOM IS NOT HERE?

11:50.433 --> 11:52.834
REALLY CRAZY WHEN I THINK
ABOUT HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN

11:52.834 --> 11:53.033
ABOUT HOW LONG SHE HAS BEEN GONE.

11:53.033 --> 11:54.667
GONE.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.166
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN GONE?

11:56.166 --> 11:57.033
DIED IN 1992.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.600
OH, MY GOSH.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.033
I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.

12:02.033 --> 12:02.867
SHE GOT SICK IN JANUARY AND DIED

12:02.867 --> 12:04.667
JULY 6th.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.500
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU

12:05.500 --> 12:07.033
UNDERSTAND THAT SHE PROBABLY

12:07.033 --> 12:08.266
WASN'T GOING TO MAKE IT?

12:08.266 --> 12:09.333
I DIDN'T KNOW UNTIL THE LAST

12:09.333 --> 12:10.467
DAY WE SEEN HER.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.700
I THOUGHT THERE WAS A CHANCE

12:12.700 --> 12:13.166
SHE WAS GOING TO LIVE.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.734
MMH-MMH.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.100
CANCER IS TREACHEROUS.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.967
IT DON'T DISCRIMINATE.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.100
I WOULDN'T WISH THAT PAIN ON

12:21.100 --> 12:22.300
MY WORST ENEMY.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.467
IF I HAD A BILLION DOLLARS, I

12:24.467 --> 12:26.133
WOULD PUT IT INTO CANCER

12:26.133 --> 12:32.667
RESEARCH AND FIND OUT WHAT MAKES

12:32.667 --> 12:36.700
KIDS DIE FROM SIDS.

12:36.700 --> 12:37.967
MY SON'S DEATH CERTIFICATE.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.967
IT SEEMS UNIMAGINABLE.
SOME OF THE STUFF YOU HAVE GONE

12:40.967 --> 12:41.233
SOME OF THE STUFF YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH.

12:41.233 --> 12:43.367
THROUGH.

12:43.367 --> 12:44.734
LAMAR ODOM DOCUMENTARY IS

12:44.734 --> 12:46.300
GOING TO BE TOUGH.
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GET

12:46.300 --> 12:46.533
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO GET THROUGH.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.800
THROUGH.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.867
HARD TIMES, TRAGEDY IS

12:48.867 --> 12:49.900
SOMETHING WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED

12:49.900 --> 12:51.567
FOR MENTALLY.

12:51.567 --> 12:52.367
YOU DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'S GOING

12:52.367 --> 12:54.667
TO COME.

12:54.667 --> 12:57.066
GOD HAS A DIFFERENT PLAN FOR

12:57.066 --> 12:58.767
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.

12:58.767 --> 13:00.934
WE'RE GOING TO BE TESTED.

13:00.934 --> 13:02.400
THE TEST I HAVE BEEN PUT THROUGH

13:02.400 --> 13:04.100
JUST MADE ME STRONGER.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.667
HARD TIMES MAKES YOU APPRECIATE

13:06.667 --> 13:08.100
SMALLEST LITTLE THING.

13:08.100 --> 13:09.100
WHETHER IT'S A HUG OR TELLING

13:09.100 --> 13:10.300
SOMEONE YOU LOVE THEM.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.433
I LOVE YOU BACK.

13:11.433 --> 13:13.800
IT'S FUNNY.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.467
I USED TO TELL THE DUDES ON MY

13:15.467 --> 13:17.667
TEAM, Y'ALL ARE LUCKY.
YOU GET TO HAVE YOUR MOMS AT THE

13:17.667 --> 13:17.867
YOU GET TO HAVE YOUR MOMS AT THE GAME.

13:17.867 --> 13:19.900
GAME.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.767
YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO WITH MY

13:21.767 --> 13:24.834
MOM AT THE GAME?

13:24.834 --> 13:28.000
I THINK THAT WHAT YOU HAVE

13:28.000 --> 13:28.467
DONE WOULD EXCEED EXPECTATIONS.

13:28.467 --> 13:29.667
I HOPE SO.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.967
I KNOW SO.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.667
SO MANY PARTS OF LAMORE

13:33.667 --> 13:35.066
ODOM'S STORY IS INSPIRING TO ME
AND PUTS THINGS INTO

13:35.066 --> 13:35.367
AND PUTS THINGS INTO PERSPECTIVE.

13:35.367 --> 13:37.667
PERSPECTIVE.

13:37.667 --> 13:39.266
SOME DAYS, I'M SO FRUSTRATED
WITH LAMAR HE'S NOT MORE IN THE

13:39.266 --> 13:39.467
WITH LAMAR HE'S NOT MORE IN THE GAME.

13:39.467 --> 13:40.867
GAME.

13:40.867 --> 13:42.767
THEN I HAVE TO TAKE A STEP BACK

13:42.767 --> 13:44.667
AND LOOK AT HIS EXPERIENCE IN

13:44.667 --> 13:46.567
LIFE AND REALIZE, HE'S BEEN ABLE

13:46.567 --> 13:47.266
TO DEFY EVERY ODD THAT'S THROWN

13:47.266 --> 13:49.934
HIS WAY.

13:49.934 --> 13:51.200
THE TRAGIC THINGS HE'S

13:51.200 --> 13:53.066
EXPERIENCED, HE HAS BEEN ABLE TO
RISE UP AND KEEP PUSHING

13:53.066 --> 13:53.633
RISE UP AND KEEP PUSHING FORWARD.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.000
FORWARD.
THE FACT YOU DEFIED ALL THESE

13:56.000 --> 13:56.300
THE FACT YOU DEFIED ALL THESE ODDS.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.567
ODDS.

13:57.567 --> 13:58.633
COME FROM NOTHING AND GET TO

13:58.633 --> 14:02.033
WHERE YOU HAVE GOTTEN AND BECOME
A LEGEND FOR WHAT YOU DO IS VERY

14:02.033 --> 14:02.333
A LEGEND FOR WHAT YOU DO IS VERY REMARKABLE.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.800
REMARKABLE.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.066
SEEMS LIKE A WORD NOT FITTING

14:08.066 --> 14:12.266
FOR WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.

14:12.266 --> 14:14.734
IT'S REALLY, REALLY INSPIRING.

14:14.734 --> 14:21.467
I DON'T TELL YOU THAT ENOUGH.

14:21.467 --> 14:24.934
I APPRECIATE THAT, TODRICK.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.400
LAMAR, TODRICK, PLEASE GO TO

14:28.400 --> 14:30.667

I HATE WHEN I GO TO AMUSEMENT

14:46.133 --> 14:46.533
I HATE WHEN I GO TO AMUSEMENT PARKS.

14:46.533 --> 14:50.700

WE DID NOT GO UP ON THE BLOCK

14:59.734 --> 15:00.066
WE DID NOT GO UP ON THE BLOCK TOGETHER.

LET'S GO!

17:18.900 --> 17:20.000
IT'S STILL SNOWING.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.800
FINALLY, THE OTHER

17:21.800 --> 17:23.767
CELEBRITIES ARE HERE.

17:23.767 --> 17:26.433
I GO INTO THE BACKYARD.
I SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WINTER

17:26.433 --> 17:26.734
I SEE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WINTER WONDERLAND.

17:26.734 --> 17:29.200
WONDERLAND.
COME ON, BIG BROTHER WITH THE

17:29.200 --> 17:30.066
COME ON, BIG BROTHER WITH THE BUDGET.

17:30.066 --> 17:31.734
BUDGET.

17:31.734 --> 17:39.867
THERE'S PINE TREES EVERYWHERE.

17:39.867 --> 17:40.734
I SEE A SCREEN WITH T.

17:40.734 --> 17:42.033
I'M GOING TO LISTEN.

17:42.033 --> 17:44.066
WHAT YOU GOT TO SAY.

17:44.066 --> 17:47.200
WELCOME TO THE GREATEST VETO

17:47.200 --> 17:47.367
COMPETITION EVER PLAYED.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.767
WHY?

17:50.767 --> 17:53.967
BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.
I USED TO BE THE PLAIN OLD VETO

17:53.967 --> 17:54.233
I USED TO BE THE PLAIN OLD VETO MEDALLION.

17:54.233 --> 17:57.266
MEDALLION.

17:57.266 --> 17:59.233
BUT NOW THAT I'M AN A-LISTER, I

17:59.233 --> 18:01.700
DECIDED TO DITCH THE BB HOUSE

18:01.700 --> 18:02.900
AND SEE THE WORLD.

18:02.900 --> 18:05.867
AND IF YOU WANT TO SPEND MORE

18:05.867 --> 18:08.333
TIME WITH ME, WHICH I ASSUME YOU

18:08.333 --> 18:11.100
ALL DO, THEN YOU NEED TO PAY

18:11.100 --> 18:12.834
ATTENTION TO MY EVERY MOVE.

18:12.834 --> 18:16.000
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.600
IN EACH ROUND, THREE IDENTICAL

18:17.600 --> 18:20.233
OBJECTS WILL APPEAR.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.533
AND I WILL GO INTO ONE OF THEM.

18:21.533 --> 18:24.033
THEN THEY'LL SHUFFLE AROUND AND

18:24.033 --> 18:26.533
YOU NEED TO KEEP TRACK OF WHERE

18:26.533 --> 18:28.867
I AM AT ALL TIMES.

18:28.867 --> 18:30.166
AFTER THEY STOP, IDENTIFY WHICH

18:30.166 --> 18:32.867
ONE I'M IN.

18:32.867 --> 18:36.633
OBJECT A, B OR C.
GET IT RIGHT, AND YOU GET A

18:36.633 --> 18:36.834
GET IT RIGHT, AND YOU GET A POINT.

18:36.834 --> 18:38.800
POINT.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.834
THE HOUSE GUEST TO EARN THE MOST

18:40.834 --> 18:43.900
POINTS AFTER SEVEN ROUNDS WINS

18:43.900 --> 18:48.734
THE GOLDEN POWER OF VETO.

18:48.734 --> 18:50.934
WHO IS READY TO PLAY EGO VETO?

18:50.934 --> 18:52.433
YEAH, LET'S GO!

18:53.967 --> 18:55.033
GOING INTO THIS COMPETITION,

18:55.033 --> 18:58.200
I WOULD LOVE TO WIN.
BUT I REALLY NEED CYNTHIA TO

18:58.200 --> 18:58.367
BUT I REALLY NEED CYNTHIA TO WIN.

18:58.367 --> 18:59.934
WIN.
IF THAT HAPPENS, SHE CAN TAKE ME

18:59.934 --> 19:00.200
IF THAT HAPPENS, SHE CAN TAKE ME DOWN.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.367
DOWN.

19:02.367 --> 19:03.867
WE CAN BOTH BE SAFE.

19:03.867 --> 19:04.967
IF YOU'RE ON THE BLOCK,

19:04.967 --> 19:06.367
YOU'RE IN DANGER.

19:06.367 --> 19:08.066
I DON'T WANT TO RISK GOING HOME.

19:08.066 --> 19:11.033
I ALREADY DEDICATED WEEKS AWAY

19:11.033 --> 19:13.633
FROM MY CHILDREN TO BE HERE.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.000
IF I CAN WIN THIS VETO, AND

19:16.000 --> 19:17.800
ENSURE MY SAFETY, THAT MAKES ME

19:17.800 --> 19:20.133
ONE STEP CLOSER TO THE FINALE.

19:20.133 --> 19:20.834
AS HOH THIS WEEK, MY TARGET

19:20.834 --> 19:23.433
IS CARSON.

19:23.433 --> 19:24.567
HE'S JUST TOO BIG OF A THREAT TO

19:24.567 --> 19:25.300
LEAVE IN THIS HOUSE SO CLOSE TO

19:25.300 --> 19:27.333
THE END OF THE GAME.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.633
I WANT TO MAKE SURE I WIN THIS

19:29.633 --> 19:30.300
WEEK SO I DON'T HAVE TO PUT UP A

19:30.300 --> 19:34.734
REPLACEMENT NOMINATION.

19:34.734 --> 19:37.367
I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP CYNTHIA.

19:37.367 --> 19:40.000
I'M AN MMA FIGHTER.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.433
I'M USED TO BOBBING AND WEAVING

19:43.433 --> 19:44.767
AND KEEPING MY EYE ON THE TARGET

19:44.767 --> 19:45.266
DESPITE PUNCHES BEING THROWN AT

19:45.266 --> 19:47.967
MY FACE.

19:47.967 --> 19:50.400
I HAVE TO CONCENTRATE.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.800
LET'S START WITH ROUND ONE.

19:52.800 --> 19:58.633
OBVIOUSLY, I ONLY FLY PRIVATE.

19:58.633 --> 20:07.233
PAY ATTENTION TO WHICH JET I'M

20:07.233 --> 20:15.400
IN.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.400
WHICH JET AM I IN, A, B OR C?

20:17.400 --> 20:18.467
I'M SO CONFUSED EVEN AFTER

20:18.467 --> 20:19.600
THE FIRST ONE.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.400
I HAVE NO IDEA.

20:23.400 --> 20:23.967
I JUST CHOOSE B.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.633
FOR BECAUSE.

20:26.633 --> 20:29.033
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.734
HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:31.734 --> 20:34.166
I HAVE NO IDEA.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.734
THIS COMPETITION IS CRAZY.

20:35.734 --> 20:37.433
I WAS IN JET A.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.367
I GOT IT.

20:39.367 --> 20:40.800
I GOT LUCKY, DUDE.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.500
TODD AND CYNTHIA, YOU ARE

20:42.500 --> 20:45.633
BOTH CORRECT.

20:45.633 --> 20:48.667
THAT IS REALLY DIFFICULT.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.633
YEA, CYNTHIA!

20:50.633 --> 20:52.700
AND YEA, TODD!

20:52.700 --> 20:54.567
I'M A GAMER.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.000
I'M USED TO PLAYING GAMES AT

20:56.000 --> 20:58.533
VERY FAST PACE.

20:58.533 --> 20:59.734
I MAY BE GOOD AT THIS EGO VETO.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.834
THANK YOU, JESUS.

21:01.834 --> 21:03.600
I GOT THE FIRST ONE.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.133
LET'S KEEP HOPE ALIVE.
LOOKS LIKE I COULD WIN THIS

21:05.133 --> 21:05.333
LOOKS LIKE I COULD WIN THIS THING.

21:05.333 --> 21:08.233
THING.

21:08.233 --> 21:08.500
BRING IT ON, EGO VETO!

21:08.500 --> 21:09.834
OK.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.600
ROUND TWO.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.467
NOTHING LIKE A GOOD LIMO TO GIVE

21:14.467 --> 21:24.700
ME THE EGO BOOST I DESERVE.
PAY ATTENTION.

21:25.266 --> 21:30.967
WHICH LIMO AM I IN?

21:30.967 --> 21:33.100
A, B OR C?

21:33.100 --> 21:34.800
ROUND TWO EGO VETO IS HIDING

21:34.800 --> 21:37.200
IN ONE OF THE LIMOUSINES.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.633
I START RECALIBRATING HOW I'M

21:38.633 --> 21:40.533
FOCUSING ON THIS.

21:40.533 --> 21:41.166
I DECIDE I'M NOT GOING TO LOOK

21:41.166 --> 21:43.266
BIG PICTURE.

21:43.266 --> 21:44.900
I'M GOING TO LITERALLY LASER

21:44.900 --> 21:46.900
FOCUS IN ON WHATEVER LIMOUSINE

21:46.900 --> 21:48.500
HE GETS INTO AND WHEREVER THAT

21:48.500 --> 21:50.300
LIMOUSINE GOES, MY EYEBALLS ARE

21:50.300 --> 21:51.467
GOING TOO.

21:51.467 --> 21:54.734
NO IDEA.

21:54.734 --> 21:56.266
GUESSING AGAIN.

21:56.266 --> 22:01.066
I'M CONFIDENT THAT EGO VETO

22:01.066 --> 22:03.633
IS HIDING IN A.

22:03.633 --> 22:05.734
I WAS IN LIMO A.

22:05.734 --> 22:07.500
TODD, MIESHA AND TODRICK ALL

22:07.500 --> 22:07.834
GOT IT RIGHT.

22:07.834 --> 22:09.967
YES!

22:09.967 --> 22:10.767
I'M THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS BOTH

22:10.767 --> 22:12.467
QUESTIONS RIGHT SO FAR.

22:12.467 --> 22:13.700
IF I CAN KEEP UP THE MOMENTUM, I

22:13.700 --> 22:15.200
SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOLD ALL THE

22:15.200 --> 22:16.600
POWER THIS WEEK.

22:16.600 --> 22:20.967
ALL RIGHT.

22:20.967 --> 22:24.734
LET'S GO FOR ROUND 3.

22:24.734 --> 22:25.433
I'M ALWAYS ON THE VIP COUNT AT

22:25.433 --> 22:35.667
THE CLUB.
PAY ATTENTION.

22:37.200 --> 22:42.333
WHICH COUCH AM I ON?

22:42.333 --> 22:43.767
A, B OR C?

22:43.767 --> 22:45.400
MY STRATEGY IS TO LOOK AT

22:45.400 --> 22:46.900
THIS LIKE A DANCE FORMATION.

22:46.900 --> 22:47.734
I'M A CHOREOGRAPHER IN THE

22:47.734 --> 22:49.033
OUTSIDE WORLD.

22:49.033 --> 22:51.100
I HAVE TO SWITCH FORMATIONS

22:51.100 --> 22:52.600
AROUND ALL THE TIME.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.433
ULTIMATELY EGO VETO IS THE STAR.

22:54.433 --> 22:56.467
I KNOW WHERE THE STAR IS GOING

22:56.467 --> 23:00.333
TO LAND UP, DARLING.

23:00.333 --> 23:02.567
I WAS ON COUCH C.

23:02.567 --> 23:04.300
TODD, MIESHA, TODRICK AND

23:04.300 --> 23:06.567
CYNTHIA GOT IT RIGHT.

23:06.567 --> 23:08.667
TODD IS STILL IN THE LEAD.

23:08.667 --> 23:09.767
I AM A COMPETITOR AT HEART.

23:09.767 --> 23:12.300
OF COURSE I WANT TO WIN.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.233
MY STRATEGY IS WORKING.

23:14.233 --> 23:15.934
TODD HAS ONE UP ON ME, BUT I'M

23:15.934 --> 23:17.100
COMING FOR YOU, TODD.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.233
I'M TERRIBLE AT THIS.

23:19.233 --> 23:21.467
COME ON, CYNTHIA!

23:21.467 --> 23:22.934
I'M TRYING.

23:22.934 --> 23:24.333
ROUND 4.

23:24.333 --> 23:34.166
HERE I GO.

23:34.166 --> 23:36.100
PAY ATTENTION.

23:36.100 --> 23:41.133
READY OR YACHT.

23:41.133 --> 23:42.600
WHICH YACHT AM I IN, A, B OR C?

23:42.600 --> 23:43.700
THEY START SPINNING AROUND.

23:43.700 --> 23:44.900
GOING CRAZY.

23:44.900 --> 23:46.200
THEY'RE GOING UP AND DOWN.

23:46.200 --> 23:47.300
THERE'S SO MANY PLACES TO HIDE

23:47.300 --> 23:53.633
ON A YACHT.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.066
I WATCHED BELOW DECK.

23:56.066 --> 23:59.100
I WAS IN YACHT B.

23:59.100 --> 24:02.934
MIESHA AND TODRICK GOT IT RIGHT.

24:02.934 --> 24:03.800
YOU GOT IT, TRA TODRICK.

24:03.800 --> 24:06.934
THIS COMPETITION IS

24:06.934 --> 24:08.700
IMPOSSIBLE, MAN.

24:08.700 --> 24:10.333
I PLAYED IN THE STREETS OF
MANHATTAN, BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE

24:10.333 --> 24:10.667
MANHATTAN, BUT IT'S NOTHING LIKE THIS.

24:10.667 --> 24:12.400
THIS.

24:12.400 --> 24:13.834
I THINK I KILLED TOO MANY

24:13.834 --> 24:15.800
BRAIN CELLS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.
I THINK I KILLED MORE THERE,

24:15.800 --> 24:16.000
I THINK I KILLED MORE THERE, BUDDY.

24:16.000 --> 24:19.200
BUDDY.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.133
THIS IS NOT GOING WELL.

24:20.133 --> 24:22.900
ROUND 5.

24:22.900 --> 24:28.433
HEY, DON'T BE JELLY.

24:28.433 --> 24:35.900
JUST KEEP TRACK OF ME.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.200
WHICH HELICOPTER AM I IN, A,

24:40.200 --> 24:41.767
B OR C?

24:41.767 --> 24:44.233
OH, COME ON!

24:44.233 --> 24:45.600
I MEAN, I DON'T REMEMBER IF I

24:45.600 --> 24:47.800
WAS FOLLOWING ONE OF THE THREE
HELICOPTERS OR THE TWO THAT

24:47.800 --> 24:48.200
HELICOPTERS OR THE TWO THAT CAME.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.734
CAME.

24:49.734 --> 24:51.367
DID EGO VETO LEAVE?

24:51.367 --> 24:53.367
IS THIS A TRICK QUESTION.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.300
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO.

24:55.300 --> 24:55.934
THAT WAS HARD.

24:55.934 --> 24:58.100
QUIET, PLEASE.

24:58.100 --> 24:59.300
HELP THE REST OF US FOCUS.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.066
I HAVE NO IDEA.

25:01.066 --> 25:04.500
I BLINKED.

25:04.500 --> 25:06.767
I WAS IN HELICOPTER C.

25:06.767 --> 25:09.266
CARSON, MIESHA, TODRICK AND

25:09.266 --> 25:10.300
CYNTHIA ALL GOT IT RIGHT.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.633
BASICALLY AT THIS POINT I

25:11.633 --> 25:13.266
HAVE ONE POINT.

25:13.266 --> 25:15.867
BUT CYNTHIA HAS THREE.

25:15.867 --> 25:17.867
SO SHE COULD STILL WIN.

25:17.867 --> 25:20.867
I'M ALSO HOPING MAY BE THERE'S

25:20.867 --> 25:22.066
LIKE A ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE AND WE

25:22.066 --> 25:23.367
HAVE TO START OVER.

25:23.367 --> 25:25.033
ONE CAN DREAM.

25:25.033 --> 25:27.033
YOU'RE STILL IN IT, CYNTHIA.

25:27.033 --> 25:29.033
THANK YOU.

25:29.033 --> 25:31.000
I'M TRYING.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.834
THIS IS YOU, TODD. YEAH.

25:33.834 --> 25:34.200
YEAH.

25:34.200 --> 25:34.533
ALL RIGHT.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.300
SPACE SHIPS.

25:36.300 --> 25:39.100
THIS ONE IS DEFINITELY FOR ME.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.867
THERE'S NO WAY I CAN MISS IT.

25:41.867 --> 25:42.700
IF SHATNER WENT UP, YOU KNOW I

25:42.700 --> 25:43.700
CAN GO UP.

25:43.700 --> 25:45.767
THE PRESSURE IS ON.

25:45.767 --> 25:47.266
BUT I'M ONLY ONE POINT BEHIND

25:47.266 --> 25:49.200
TODRICK AND MIESHA.
SO I NEED TO GET THIS ROUND

25:49.200 --> 25:49.400
SO I NEED TO GET THIS ROUND RIGHT.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.967
RIGHT.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.367
I CAN STILL PULL IT OUT AND WIN

25:53.367 --> 25:53.900
THIS VETO.

25:53.900 --> 25:55.867
ROUND 6.

25:55.867 --> 25:56.900
ONLY THE BIGGEST STARS GET TO GO

25:56.900 --> 26:01.567
TO SPACE.

26:01.567 --> 26:11.600
PAY ATTENTION TO WHERE I GO.

26:13.200 --> 26:16.567
WHICH SPACE SHIP AM I IN, A,

26:16.567 --> 26:20.700
B OR C?

26:20.700 --> 26:21.667
COME ON!

26:21.667 --> 26:23.266
LAMAR, IF YOU COULD REFRAIN

26:23.266 --> 26:25.433
FROM COMMENTING DURING, IT WOULD

26:25.433 --> 26:27.367
HELP ME STAY FOCUSED.

26:27.367 --> 26:29.300
LAMAR, PLEASE STOP TALKING.

26:29.300 --> 26:32.266
I'M LIKE DOING EVERYTHING I CAN

26:32.266 --> 26:33.800
TO FOCUS AND EVEN THE SMALLEST

26:33.800 --> 26:35.800
DISTRACTION IS COMPLETELY

26:35.800 --> 26:37.166
THROWING ANOTHER WRENCH IN AN

26:37.166 --> 26:38.333
ALREADY COMPLICATED PUZZLE.

26:38.333 --> 26:40.000
LAMAR, I LOVE YOU.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.667
BUT SHHH!

26:40.667 --> 26:42.667
NO WORRIES.

26:42.667 --> 26:46.166
THE PRESSURE IS ON.
THIS IS THE HARDEST COMP I HAVE

26:46.166 --> 26:46.367
THIS IS THE HARDEST COMP I HAVE DONE.

26:46.367 --> 26:48.033
DONE.

26:48.033 --> 26:49.433
BUT I'M STILL IN THE GAME.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.033
I CAN STILL PULL IT OUT AND WIN

26:51.033 --> 26:53.233
THIS VETO.

26:53.233 --> 26:56.100
I WAS IN SPACE SHIP A.

26:56.100 --> 26:57.700
GOT IT.

26:57.700 --> 27:01.600
TODD, MIESHA AND TODRICK ALL

27:01.600 --> 27:03.900
GOT IT RIGHT.

27:03.900 --> 27:05.166
I GET IT WRONG.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.633
I LET CARSON DOWN.

27:06.633 --> 27:08.333
I LET MYSELF DOWN.

27:08.333 --> 27:10.266
I'M REALLY DISAPPOINTED THAT I

27:10.266 --> 27:11.834
WAS NOT ABLE TO WIN THE VETO.

27:11.834 --> 27:13.800
IT WAS THE ONE I REALLY NEEDED

27:13.800 --> 27:15.567
TO WIN.

27:15.567 --> 27:20.367
SO NOW CARSON AND I HAVE TO TRY
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT PLAY

27:20.367 --> 27:21.200
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT PLAY IS.

27:21.200 --> 27:22.433
IS.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.266
CARSON AND CYNTHIA ARE DOWN

27:23.266 --> 27:25.767
FOR THE COUNT.
NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE FINAL

27:25.767 --> 27:25.967
NOW IT'S DOWN TO THE FINAL ROUND.

27:25.967 --> 27:28.300
ROUND.

27:28.300 --> 27:29.834
MY SIDE OF THE HOUSE HAS

27:29.834 --> 27:34.400
BASICALLY ALREADY WON THIS COMP.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.567
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS BRING THIS

27:36.567 --> 27:38.800
HOME WIN, BABY.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.033
THIS COULDN'T BE BETTER FOR US

27:41.033 --> 27:42.166
OR WORSE FOR CARSON.

27:42.166 --> 27:44.800
MYSELF, MIESHA AND TODRICK.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.467
IF THEY GET IT WRONG AND I GET

27:46.467 --> 27:48.200
IT RIGHT, I CAN FORCE A TIE AND

27:48.200 --> 27:49.367
TRY TO WIN THIS THING.

27:49.367 --> 27:51.200
ROUND 7.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.233
MY MODEL FRIENDS ALWAYS KEEP ME

27:53.233 --> 28:02.066
CLOSE BY.

28:02.066 --> 28:08.767
PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.

28:08.767 --> 28:11.467
WHICH PURSE AM I IN, A, B OR C?

28:11.467 --> 28:11.834
IS THERE A D IN THIS

28:11.834 --> 28:14.000
CATEGORY?

28:14.000 --> 28:14.266
I WAS IN PURSE A.

28:14.266 --> 28:15.667
YES!

28:15.667 --> 28:17.567
GOT IT.

28:17.567 --> 28:22.300
MIESHA WINS THE GOLDEN POWER

28:22.300 --> 28:22.967
OF VETO!

28:22.967 --> 28:24.767
WHAT?

28:25.000 --> 28:27.667
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID THAT.

28:27.667 --> 28:29.734
THAT.

28:29.734 --> 28:30.467
LOOK AT THAT.

28:30.467 --> 28:31.967
OH, MY GOSH.

28:31.967 --> 28:35.600
YOU SEE THAT?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.100
I WOULDN'T MIND ADDING THIS TO

28:37.100 --> 28:40.300
MY TROPHY WALL.

28:40.300 --> 28:42.166
MY PLAN IS UNFOLDING PERFECTLY.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.600
I COULDN'T BE MORE ELATED WITH

28:43.600 --> 28:45.600
HOW EVERYTHING IS WORKING OUT.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.500
I DON'T WANT TO CHANGE THE

28:46.500 --> 28:48.734
NOMINATIONS BECAUSE THIS HAS

28:48.734 --> 28:50.333
BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

28:50.333 --> 28:50.734
CARSON IS RIGHT WHERE I WANT HIM

28:50.734 --> 28:54.400
TO BE.
IT'S FINALLY TIME TO SEND HIM

28:54.400 --> 28:55.567
IT'S FINALLY TIME TO SEND HIM HOME.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.900
HOME.
MIESHA IS ANNOUNCED THE

28:56.900 --> 28:57.133
MIESHA IS ANNOUNCED THE WINNER.

28:57.133 --> 28:59.900
WINNER.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.166
I HAVE TO DO A FAKE SMILE LIKE A

29:01.166 --> 29:02.500
BEAUTY PAGEANT PERSON WHEN THEY

29:02.500 --> 29:04.934
DON'T WIN.
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO HAPPY FOR

29:04.934 --> 29:05.100
OH, MY GOD, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU.

29:05.100 --> 29:07.600
YOU.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.033
YOU DID GREAT!

29:10.033 --> 29:11.700
YOU'RE AMAZING.
SO THINGS AREN'T LOOKING

29:11.700 --> 29:12.600
SO THINGS AREN'T LOOKING GOOD.

29:12.600 --> 29:15.767
GOOD.

29:15.767 --> 29:20.467
HOWEVER, I'M NOT YET READY TO

29:20.467 --> 29:22.000
THROW IN THE HIGH QUALITY COTTON
TOWEL, OH, NO.

29:22.000 --> 29:22.467
TOWEL, OH, NO. CONGRATULATIONS.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.367
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANK YOU.

29:24.367 --> 29:26.567
THANK YOU. CONGRATULATIONS.

29:26.567 --> 29:28.600
CONGRATULATIONS.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.934
Julie: UP NEXT, CARSON AND

29:30.934 --> 29:33.834
CYNTHIA HAVE COME UP SHORT.

29:33.834 --> 29:35.133
BUT A GLIMMER OF HOPE SHINES IN

29:35.133 --> 29:37.600
THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

29:37.600 --> 29:38.633
THEN, IT'S TIME TO SEND ANOTHER

29:38.633 --> 29:40.667
CELEBRITY HOME.

29:40.667 --> 29:42.533
WHO WILL BE EVICTED AND WHO WILL

29:42.533 --> 29:45.934
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL FIVE?

29:45.934 --> 29:49.433
STAY WITH US.

30:00.066 --> 30:03.066
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

30:03.066 --> 30:05.633
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

30:05.633 --> 30:09.567
MIESHA MAY HAVE WON THE VETO,

30:09.567 --> 30:09.834
BUT COULD A BIGGER TARGET BE

30:09.834 --> 30:14.567
EMERGING?

30:14.967 --> 30:16.400
WOO!

30:16.400 --> 30:17.233
OK.

30:17.233 --> 30:18.633
RIGHT.

30:18.633 --> 30:20.400
CONGRATS, LOVE.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.233
OH, MY GOSH.

30:21.233 --> 30:23.400
I HAVEN'T DONE THAT YET.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.433
I'M EXCITED I WON THE GOLDEN

30:25.433 --> 30:26.367
POWER OF VETO BECAUSE CARSON HAS
SLIPPED THROUGH MY FINGERS

30:26.367 --> 30:26.700
SLIPPED THROUGH MY FINGERS BEFORE.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.734
BEFORE.

30:28.734 --> 30:31.667
BUT THIS TIME, CUPCAKE SHOULD

30:31.667 --> 30:33.000
HAVE A CLEAN TAKE DOWN.

30:33.000 --> 30:34.433
HELICOPTER GOT ME.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.767
WHEN IT SWITCHED.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.600
CRUISE SHIP I MISSED.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.467
MIESHA WON THE VETO.

30:39.467 --> 30:40.433
I KNOW SHE'LL LEAVE MY

30:40.433 --> 30:42.467
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR

30:42.467 --> 30:43.066
IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR CARSON.

30:43.066 --> 30:44.233
CARSON.

30:44.233 --> 30:45.767
CARSON IS A WONDERFUL GUY.

30:45.767 --> 30:47.200
HE'S A HUGE THREAT.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.600
IF HE STAYS AROUND LONGER THAN

30:49.600 --> 30:50.600
THIS WEEK, IT WILL BE ONE OF US

30:50.600 --> 30:51.667
ON THE BLOCK GOING HOME.

30:51.667 --> 30:52.734
THAT WAS HARD.

30:52.734 --> 30:55.567
THAT WAS HARDER THAN I
EXPECTED IT TO BE, TO BE HONEST.

30:55.567 --> 30:55.934
EXPECTED IT TO BE, TO BE HONEST. IMPOSSIBLE.

30:55.934 --> 30:59.400
IMPOSSIBLE.
NOT WINNING THE VETO IS NOT

30:59.400 --> 30:59.734
NOT WINNING THE VETO IS NOT FUN.

30:59.734 --> 31:00.834
FUN.

31:00.834 --> 31:03.300
CYNTHIA DIDN'T WIN EITHER.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.033
SO WE'RE IN A BIT OF HOT WATER.

31:05.033 --> 31:08.734
WE COULD TALK TO MIESHA ABOUT

31:08.734 --> 31:11.333
USING THE VETO TO TAKE ME DOWN.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.467
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.

31:13.467 --> 31:17.033
I'M NOT GOING TO TALK TO HER AND

31:17.033 --> 31:18.233
SHE'S ALSO NOT GOING TO DO IT.

31:18.233 --> 31:20.333
I DIDN'T WIN THE VETO WHICH

31:20.333 --> 31:21.567
MEANS I'M STILL ON THE BLOCK.

31:21.567 --> 31:24.400
IT'S NOT IDEAL.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.934
AS LONG AS I'M UP THERE NEXT TO

31:25.934 --> 31:32.900
CARSON, I SHOULD BE ABLE TO

31:32.900 --> 31:35.066
SURVIVE EVICTION.

31:36.400 --> 31:37.967
IT WAS TOUGHER TODAY.

31:37.967 --> 31:38.233
TODAY WAS?

31:38.233 --> 31:40.467
YEAH.

31:40.467 --> 31:43.633
TODAY LONG DAY.
YOU'RE ON THE BLOCK.

31:43.633 --> 31:44.800
YOU'RE ON THE BLOCK. YEAH.

31:44.800 --> 31:45.967
YEAH.

31:45.967 --> 31:48.900
AND PROBABLY GOING TO GET RID

31:48.900 --> 31:50.266
OF ME.
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING

31:50.266 --> 31:50.734
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO.

31:50.734 --> 31:51.000
TO.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.433
YEAH.

31:52.433 --> 31:54.066
I HAVE JUST BEEN FIGHTING MY

31:54.066 --> 31:54.934
LITTLE WAY UP TO THE TOP.

31:54.934 --> 31:56.700
YES, YOU HAVE.

31:56.700 --> 31:58.266
BUT HERE'S MY ADVICE TO YOU.

31:58.266 --> 32:01.567
IF THEY GET RID OF ME, YOU
SHOULD TEAM UP WITH CYNTHIA

32:01.567 --> 32:02.166
SHOULD TEAM UP WITH CYNTHIA IMMEDIATELY.

32:02.166 --> 32:03.500
IMMEDIATELY.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.967
YEAH.

32:04.967 --> 32:06.567
AND THEN YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU
NEED TO DO.

32:06.567 --> 32:06.834
NEED TO DO. YEP.

32:06.834 --> 32:08.400
YEP.
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE SAFE

32:08.400 --> 32:08.800
I DON'T THINK YOU'LL BE SAFE ALONE.

32:08.800 --> 32:10.233
ALONE.

32:10.233 --> 32:11.900
I REALLY WANT TO HELP KEEP MY

32:11.900 --> 32:13.100
GIRL CYNTHIA IN THE GAME AS LONG

32:13.100 --> 32:14.600
AS POSSIBLE.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.567
AND ALTHOUGH LAMAR IS PROBABLY

32:16.567 --> 32:18.100
NOT AN EXPERT ON GAME PLAY,

32:18.100 --> 32:21.900
THERE IS STRENGTH IN NUMBERS.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.633
SO WHY NOT HAVE HIM TEAM UP WITH

32:23.633 --> 32:25.667
CYNTHIA AND THEY CAN BOTH

32:25.667 --> 32:26.467
FURTHER THEIR GAMES?

32:26.467 --> 32:27.633
MY TWO CENTS.

32:27.633 --> 32:29.567
I GET IT.

32:29.567 --> 32:32.233
I HEAR WHAT CARSON IS SAYING.

32:32.233 --> 32:32.934
I REALLY, REALLY ENJOY CYNTHIA

32:32.934 --> 32:34.900
BAILEY'S COMPANY.

32:34.900 --> 32:36.000
AND WOULD LIKE TO BE HER FRIEND

32:36.000 --> 32:37.533
FOR A LONG TIME.

32:37.533 --> 32:39.433
BUT I DON'T KNOW RIGHT NOW IF I

32:39.433 --> 32:40.867
WANT TO TEAM UP WITH CYNTHIA

32:40.867 --> 32:43.200
JUST TO TURN AROUND AND CUT HER

32:43.200 --> 32:47.734
GOING INTO THE FINALE.

32:47.734 --> 32:51.900
MY PARTING WORDS OF WISDOM.

32:53.433 --> 32:55.600
I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW GOOD YOU

32:55.600 --> 32:56.633
WERE AT THAT, TODD.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.667
I WAS RIGHT THERE.

32:58.667 --> 32:59.834
THE ONE THAT GOT ME WHEN IT

32:59.834 --> 33:00.600
DROPPED DOWN TOO MANY.

33:00.600 --> 33:03.433
OH, MY GOD.

33:03.433 --> 33:04.800
THEN I LOST IT.

33:04.800 --> 33:05.934
LAMAR ALMOST COST ME THAT ONE

33:05.934 --> 33:10.333
AND ANOTHER ONE.

33:10.333 --> 33:12.300
WHEN I HEARD HIM, IT'S SO

33:12.300 --> 33:13.066
DISTRACTING TO ME.

33:13.066 --> 33:14.367
STOP IT!

33:14.367 --> 33:15.633
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DEAL

33:15.633 --> 33:19.633
WITH IT.
HE HAS A DISDAIN FOR

33:19.633 --> 33:19.900
HE HAS A DISDAIN FOR AUTHORITY.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.433
AUTHORITY.

33:22.433 --> 33:25.633
HE'S PISSED, I'M SURE.

33:25.633 --> 33:27.166
HE DOESN'T LIKE TO LOSE.

33:27.166 --> 33:28.400
I LOVE LAMAR.

33:28.400 --> 33:30.767
HE DOES SOMETIMES WALK AROUND

33:30.767 --> 33:32.767
THIS HOUSE EXPECTING EVERYBODY

33:32.767 --> 33:35.433
TO CATER.

33:35.433 --> 33:44.233
YOU'RE BEING A BUTT HEAD.

33:44.233 --> 33:47.433
YOU'RE BEING DISRESPECTFUL.

33:47.433 --> 33:49.834
WE'RE TOAST.

33:49.834 --> 33:51.233
BUT, BUT, BUT, NOT TO HAVE

33:51.233 --> 33:52.066
HOPE OR ANYTHING.

33:52.066 --> 33:55.300
BUT SOME INTERESTING

33:55.300 --> 33:57.000
DEVELOPMENTS GOING O ON.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.133
I THINK MIESHA IS REALLY

33:59.133 --> 34:01.300
IRRITATED WITH LAMAR.

34:01.300 --> 34:04.233
HE KEPT TALKING WHILE SHE WAS
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE.

34:04.233 --> 34:05.834
TRYING TO CONCENTRATE. RIGHT.

34:05.834 --> 34:08.300
RIGHT.

34:08.300 --> 34:09.834
SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ATTITUDE.
NOTICED LAMAR DIDN'T EAT WITH

34:09.834 --> 34:10.233
NOTICED LAMAR DIDN'T EAT WITH US.

34:10.233 --> 34:11.700
US.

34:11.700 --> 34:13.734
NOTICED HE GOT HIS FOOD BUT

34:13.734 --> 34:15.967
DIDN'T EAT AT THE TABLE WITH US.

34:15.967 --> 34:16.500
I DON'T THINK SHE IS FEELING

34:16.500 --> 34:18.200
THAT -

34:18.200 --> 34:19.500
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

34:19.500 --> 34:21.400
BE INTERESTING IF SHE WAS NOT
FEELING IT ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME

34:21.400 --> 34:21.600
FEELING IT ENOUGH TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:21.600 --> 34:22.934
ALONE.

34:22.934 --> 34:23.567
I WASN'T GOING TO TALK TO

34:23.567 --> 34:30.767
MIESHA ANYWAY.

34:30.767 --> 34:33.734
NOW THIS LITTLE KERFUFFLE WITH

34:33.734 --> 34:34.934
LAMAR COULD BE TO MY ADVANTAGE.

34:34.934 --> 34:36.100
LET THOSE CHIPS FALL WHERE

34:36.100 --> 34:38.200
THEY MAY.

34:38.200 --> 34:38.734
IT COULD HELP MY CHANCES AT

34:38.734 --> 34:40.633
SAVING MYSELF.

34:40.633 --> 34:43.000
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.700
IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE

34:45.700 --> 34:47.433
WHAT SHE DECIDES OR TODD - SHE

34:47.433 --> 34:49.300
AND TODD DECIDE TO DO.

34:49.300 --> 34:54.934
IF SHE'S DOWN ON LAMAR, MAYBE

34:54.934 --> 34:57.633
THAT'S GOOD FOR US.

34:57.633 --> 34:59.834
Julie: UP NEXT, TWICE CARSON

34:59.834 --> 35:03.133
HAS BEEN SAVED FROM THE BLOCK.
FOR HIM, A THIRD TIME WOULD BE A

35:03.133 --> 35:03.667
FOR HIM, A THIRD TIME WOULD BE A CHARM.

35:03.667 --> 35:06.233
CHARM.
STAY WITH US.

35:19.433 --> 35:22.367
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

35:22.367 --> 35:24.333
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.533
CARSON AND CYNTHIA MAY SEE THE

35:26.533 --> 35:30.900
WRITING ON THE WALL, BUT THEY

35:30.900 --> 35:32.800
WON'T GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.633
THERE WAS A GREAT BAR IN NEW

35:34.633 --> 35:35.734
YORK CITY CALLED CHAMPS.

35:35.734 --> 35:39.000
I REMEMBER CHAMPS.
THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPORTS

35:39.000 --> 35:39.233
THIS WAS A BEAUTIFUL SPORTS BAR.

35:39.233 --> 35:40.834
BAR.
LOTS OF CUTE PEOPLE WALKED

35:40.834 --> 35:41.533
LOTS OF CUTE PEOPLE WALKED THERE.

35:41.533 --> 35:44.600
THERE.
IT WAS A HAPPENING PLACE MID

35:44.600 --> 35:45.100
IT WAS A HAPPENING PLACE MID 90s.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.734
90s.

35:46.734 --> 35:47.934
WE WERE THERE ON A THURSDAY.

35:47.934 --> 35:49.000
I MET SOMEBODY I DIDN'T KNOW

35:49.000 --> 35:51.433
THAT WELL.

35:51.433 --> 35:51.834
I JUST MET OVER A DRINK.

35:51.834 --> 35:53.867
I HAD TAKEN HIM HOME TO MY APARTMENT.

35:53.867 --> 35:57.033
APARTMENT.

35:57.033 --> 35:58.967
AND HE DID SEEM A LITTLE DODGY.

35:58.967 --> 36:00.200
WE STARTED GETTING ROMANTIC.

36:00.200 --> 36:01.934
HE'S LIKE I'M HUNGRY.

36:01.934 --> 36:04.433
I WAS LIKE, OK.

36:04.433 --> 36:04.700
WOULD YOU MAKE ME APPEAR

36:04.700 --> 36:05.767
SANDWICH?

36:05.767 --> 36:09.133
I WAS LIKE SURE.

36:09.133 --> 36:11.433
I WENT TO MAKE A SANDWICH.

36:11.433 --> 36:13.266
I WAS LIKE I WONDER IF HE IS

36:13.266 --> 36:15.133
GOING TO ROB ME.

36:15.133 --> 36:15.333
HOW ARE YOU?

36:15.333 --> 36:17.700
MAYO?

36:17.700 --> 36:19.633
WOULD YOU LIKE A PICKLE?

36:19.633 --> 36:20.400
NOT THAT I HAD ANYTHING TO STEAL

36:20.400 --> 36:21.500
AT THAT POINT.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.800
I WAS 25 YEARS OLD.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.100
MAKE HIM A SANDWICH.

36:24.100 --> 36:24.800
HE EATS IT.

36:24.800 --> 36:25.800
I THINK IT'S WEIRD.

36:25.800 --> 36:27.500
WE DO OUR THING.

36:27.500 --> 36:30.734
HE LEAVES.

36:30.734 --> 36:32.133
THE NEXT SATURDAY I'M AT CHAMPS.

36:32.133 --> 36:35.667
I GO TO PEE.

36:35.667 --> 36:38.500
ABOVE THE URINAL IS A POSTER

36:38.500 --> 36:40.200
WITH A POLICE SKETCH OF THE GUY.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.033
HE HAD BEEN WANTED FOR GOING

36:42.033 --> 36:43.867
AROUND THE CITY BEATING UP

36:43.867 --> 36:45.700
PEOPLE AND ROBBING THEM AFTER

36:45.700 --> 36:48.533
THEY TOOK HIM HOME.

36:48.533 --> 36:49.066
I ESCAPED DEATH.

36:51.633 --> 36:52.266
OH, MY GOSH!

36:52.266 --> 36:55.000
NEW YORK.

36:55.000 --> 36:59.100
THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS.

36:59.100 --> 37:00.834
WITH BOTH EYES CLOSED.

37:00.834 --> 37:01.900
JUST GOTTA STAY ALERT.
THAT'S INSANE.

37:01.900 --> 37:02.166
THAT'S INSANE. YEAH.

37:02.166 --> 37:04.867
YEAH.

37:04.867 --> 37:07.867
THAT'S A GOOD STORY, CARSON.

37:07.867 --> 37:10.333
ROMANCE ISN'T DEAD.

37:10.333 --> 37:10.767
THANKFULLY NEITHER AM I.

37:15.033 --> 37:16.467
YEAH.

37:16.467 --> 37:18.500
NOT GOING TO LIE.
GLASS OF WINE SOUNDS REALLY

37:18.500 --> 37:18.700
GLASS OF WINE SOUNDS REALLY NICE.

37:18.700 --> 37:21.934
NICE.

37:21.934 --> 37:22.834
HOW MUCH MORE DO YOU HAVE TO

37:22.834 --> 37:23.200
LOSE?

37:23.200 --> 37:26.400
17 POUNDS.

37:26.400 --> 37:26.734
YOU HAVE TO LOSE 17 MORE

37:26.734 --> 37:28.166
POUNDS?

37:28.166 --> 37:29.500
TRAINING FOR A FIGHT IN THE

37:29.500 --> 37:31.266
UFC IS HARD ENOUGH.

37:31.266 --> 37:34.200
BUT I HAVE ADDED THE TASK OF

37:34.200 --> 37:35.734
DROPPING A WEIGHT CLASS AND I'M

37:35.734 --> 37:43.734
HAVING TO DO ALL OF THIS WHILE

37:43.734 --> 37:46.200
BEING IN THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.500
I HAVE A FIGHT WAITING FOR ME.

37:47.500 --> 37:49.233
SOMEBODY WHO IS GOING TO WANT TO

37:49.233 --> 37:50.900
TRY AND TAKE MY HEAD OFF.

37:50.900 --> 37:51.800
I HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF MY

37:51.800 --> 37:58.033
TRAINING, WHICH IS MULTIPLE

37:58.033 --> 38:00.100
TIMES A DAY.
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS 13

38:00.100 --> 38:01.333
YOU HAVE BEEN DOING THIS 13 MINUTES.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.533
MINUTES.

38:02.533 --> 38:07.200
IT'S BETTER WHEN YOU HAVE

38:07.200 --> 38:08.467
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

38:08.467 --> 38:09.333
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ABOUT TO COME

38:09.333 --> 38:10.700
THROUGH THE ROOF.
I DON'T KNOW HOW MIESHA DOES

38:10.700 --> 38:11.834
I DON'T KNOW HOW MIESHA DOES IT.

38:11.834 --> 38:15.133
IT.

38:15.133 --> 38:17.100
SHE GOES FROM BEASTING US ON

38:17.100 --> 38:18.333
COMPETITIONS TO THROWING AROUND

38:18.333 --> 38:20.400
80-POUND MEDICINE BALLS.
THAT'S LIKE THROWING TODRICK

38:20.400 --> 38:20.633
THAT'S LIKE THROWING TODRICK AROUND.

38:20.633 --> 38:21.967
AROUND.

38:21.967 --> 38:24.667
I WOULD LOVE TO BEAT MIESHA

38:24.667 --> 38:26.900
IN THIS HOUSE, OK?

38:26.900 --> 38:28.433
BUT I KNOW AFTER WATCHING THIS

38:28.433 --> 38:30.834
WOMAN TRAIN AND THE DISCIPLINE

38:30.834 --> 38:32.667
SHE HAS, IF WE EVER TAKE IT TO

38:32.667 --> 38:34.367
THE STREETS, THEN I WOULD NOT

38:34.367 --> 38:38.367
STAND A FIGHTING CHANCE.

38:38.367 --> 38:42.000
NO PUN INTENDED.

38:42.000 --> 38:44.734
IF I HAD THAT DRIVE, I WOULD

38:44.734 --> 38:47.033
BE YOKED UP.

38:47.033 --> 38:49.367
I HAVE TO COUNT EVERY SINGLE

38:49.367 --> 38:52.767
CALORIE THAT GOES INTO MY BODY.

38:52.767 --> 38:54.266
JUST EATING HEALTHY, YOUR

38:54.266 --> 38:55.934
PALATE CHANGES.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.700
STRAWBERRY WILL TASTE LIKE THE
BEST THING YOU HAVE EVER HAD.

38:57.700 --> 38:59.100
BEST THING YOU HAVE EVER HAD. RIGHT.

38:59.100 --> 39:01.066
RIGHT.

39:01.066 --> 39:02.900
MAYBE GOAT CHEESE.

39:02.900 --> 39:08.200
I'M NOT ABLE TO EAT THE

39:08.200 --> 39:10.467
TREATS EVERYONE ELSE IS EATING.

39:10.467 --> 39:15.033
I DON'T KNOW HOW MIESHA CAN

39:15.033 --> 39:16.233
STICK TO HER DIET REGIMENT.

39:16.233 --> 39:21.266
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO EAT

39:21.266 --> 39:28.300
A BAG OF PEANUT M&Ms.

39:28.300 --> 39:30.900
I COMMEND YOU.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.133
TODAY'S AGENDA IS TO GET

39:36.133 --> 39:40.033
MIESHA TO NOT USE THE POWER OF
VETO PERIOD.

39:40.033 --> 39:40.333
VETO PERIOD. RIGHT.

39:40.333 --> 39:43.934
RIGHT.

39:43.934 --> 39:45.967
ME AND LAMAR AND HAVE THEM

39:45.967 --> 39:48.000
NOT GET RID OF ME.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.066
THE QUESTION THAT HAS BEEN

39:50.066 --> 39:51.266
BOTHERING ME IS WHY I DIDN'T GET
PUT UP WITH YOU.

39:51.266 --> 39:51.600
PUT UP WITH YOU. RIGHT.

39:51.600 --> 39:53.633
RIGHT.

39:53.633 --> 39:55.533
THE ONLY REASON I DIDN'T GET

39:55.533 --> 39:57.533
PUT UP WITH YOU IS TO HELP

39:57.533 --> 40:00.200
TODD'S GAME.

40:00.200 --> 40:02.266
TODD IS TRYING TO HANG ON FOR AS

40:02.266 --> 40:04.567
LONG AS HE CAN.

40:04.567 --> 40:06.066
AND USE WHOEVER HE CAN USE TO

40:06.066 --> 40:09.500
ULTIMATELY WIN.
MIESHA AND TODRICK ARE

40:09.500 --> 40:10.667
MIESHA AND TODRICK ARE UNBREAKABLE.

40:10.667 --> 40:11.700
UNBREAKABLE.

40:11.700 --> 40:14.300
NEED YOU -
TO HELP HIM BEAT TODRICK AND

40:14.300 --> 40:15.400
TO HELP HIM BEAT TODRICK AND MIESHA.

40:15.400 --> 40:15.700
MIESHA.

40:15.700 --> 40:18.533
RIGHT.

40:18.533 --> 40:19.800
TODD KNOWS THAT, WHICH IS WHY

40:19.800 --> 40:21.500
HE'S TRYING TO ALIGN OTHER

40:21.500 --> 40:21.900
PEOPLE WITH HIM.

40:21.900 --> 40:23.967
MMH-MMH.

40:23.967 --> 40:26.233
SO I WAS JUST THINKING, WE'RE

40:26.233 --> 40:27.700
NOT WITH ANYONE.

40:27.700 --> 40:29.066
WE'RE JUST WAITING TO BE PICKED
OFF PRETTY MUCH.

40:29.066 --> 40:29.367
OFF PRETTY MUCH. RIGHT.

40:29.367 --> 40:30.800
RIGHT.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.400
WE'RE FREE AGENTS OUT HERE.
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT.

40:33.400 --> 40:33.667
WE CAN DO WHAT WE WANT. YES.

40:33.667 --> 40:37.100
YES.

40:37.100 --> 40:40.166
SO WHAT IF WE GO TO MIESHA AND

40:40.166 --> 40:42.266
TODRICK AND SEE IF THEY WANT TO

40:42.266 --> 40:44.166
DO A FINAL FOUR WITH US.

40:44.166 --> 40:48.033
AND THEN THAT HAPPENS.

40:48.033 --> 40:50.066
THEN WE CAN MAKE A DEAL FOR THEM

40:50.066 --> 40:51.133
NOT TO VOTE US OUT IF WE DON'T

40:51.133 --> 40:52.567
VOTE THEM OUT.
THEN TODD WOULD BE NEXT,

40:52.567 --> 40:53.133
THEN TODD WOULD BE NEXT, BASICALLY.

40:53.133 --> 40:53.500
BASICALLY.

40:53.500 --> 40:55.333
RIGHT.

40:55.333 --> 40:57.900
THEY DECIDE TO VOTE TO KEEP ME
AND GET RID OF LAMAR.

40:57.900 --> 40:58.233
AND GET RID OF LAMAR. EXACTLY.

40:58.233 --> 41:00.467
EXACTLY.

41:00.467 --> 41:03.600
IT'S TIME TO FIGHT, PEOPLE.

41:03.600 --> 41:07.000
THE FIRST STEP IS TO CONVINCE MY

41:07.000 --> 41:09.500
ARCH NEMESIS, OUCH, THORN IN MY

41:09.500 --> 41:09.734
SIDE MIESHA NOT TO USE THE POWER

41:09.734 --> 41:10.934
OF VETO.

41:10.934 --> 41:13.633
THIS IS THE PART WHERE WE

41:13.633 --> 41:14.767
FIGHT LIKE HELL TO WIN.

41:14.767 --> 41:16.333
MAKE ANY DEALS WE CAN.

41:16.333 --> 41:17.333
THIS GAME IS NOT OVER UNTIL

41:17.333 --> 41:19.233
IT'S OVER.

41:19.233 --> 41:21.433
AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE NOT WON ANY
COMPETITIONS YET, I AM STILL A

41:21.433 --> 41:21.667
COMPETITIONS YET, I AM STILL A WINNER.

41:21.667 --> 41:23.700
WINNER.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.467
I'M GOING TO MAKE SURE CARSON

41:25.467 --> 41:27.367
AND I EXHAUST EVERY POSSIBILITY.
WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A

41:27.367 --> 41:27.867
WE'RE NOT GOING DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

41:27.867 --> 41:30.133
FIGHT.
WAITING FOR THEM TO OFFER

41:30.133 --> 41:30.600
WAITING FOR THEM TO OFFER SOMETHING.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.467
SOMETHING.

41:33.467 --> 41:34.567
WE NEED TO GO OFFER SOMETHING.

41:34.567 --> 41:35.867
LET'S TRY EVERYTHING.

41:35.867 --> 41:36.800
WE WOULD BE STUPID NOT TO DO

41:36.800 --> 41:38.200
THIS, RIGHT?

41:38.200 --> 41:40.400
WE HAVE TO DO THIS.

41:40.400 --> 41:41.900
THIS IS OUR LAST CHANCE.

41:41.900 --> 41:42.533
WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO BE

41:42.533 --> 41:44.767
PICKED OFF.
WE MADE IT THIS FAR FOR A

41:44.767 --> 41:45.033
WE MADE IT THIS FAR FOR A REASON.

41:45.033 --> 41:49.467
REASON.

41:49.467 --> 41:50.667
THAT'S THE PLAN.

41:52.800 --> 41:53.567
CAN YOU COME IN MY ROOM IN A

41:53.567 --> 41:53.834
SECOND?

41:53.834 --> 41:55.700
SURE.

41:55.700 --> 41:57.300
IN ORDER FOR OUR BIG PLAN TO

41:57.300 --> 41:58.834
WORK, CARSON AND I HAVE TO

41:58.834 --> 42:00.834
CONVINCE MIESHA TO KEEP THE

42:00.834 --> 42:02.900
NOMINATIONS THE SAME.

42:02.900 --> 42:06.867
ONCE THAT HAPPENS, THEN IT'S
TIME TO START MAKING SOME DEALS.

42:06.867 --> 42:07.133
TIME TO START MAKING SOME DEALS. OK.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.467
OK.

42:08.467 --> 42:09.867
I'M ASKING YOU THIS BECAUSE I

42:09.867 --> 42:10.633
FEEL LIKE YOU'LL BE STRAIGHT

42:10.633 --> 42:12.533
WITH ME.

42:12.533 --> 42:14.266
I KNOW YOU AND TODRICK HAVE A

42:14.266 --> 42:16.667
FINAL TWO.

42:16.667 --> 42:17.000
LAMAR IS A FREE AGENT.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.800
MMH-MMH.
I FEEL LIKE TODD IS IN THE

42:19.800 --> 42:20.867
I FEEL LIKE TODD IS IN THE GAME.

42:20.867 --> 42:21.266
GAME.

42:21.266 --> 42:23.166
YEAH.
AND I THINK HE'S PLANNING TO

42:23.166 --> 42:23.367
AND I THINK HE'S PLANNING TO WIN.

42:23.367 --> 42:24.333
WIN.

42:24.333 --> 42:24.900
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

42:24.900 --> 42:26.300
FIGURE OUT.

42:26.300 --> 42:26.834
IF YOU GUYS HAVE A FINAL FOUR

42:26.834 --> 42:28.934
WITH THEM.

42:28.934 --> 42:30.133
IF YOU DON'T, CAN WE MAKE SOME

42:30.133 --> 42:35.900
KIND OF DEAL WITH YOU GUYS TO

42:35.900 --> 42:38.133
GET A FINAL FOUR?

42:38.133 --> 42:40.867
I DID TELL LAMAR I WOULD

42:40.867 --> 42:42.266
BRING HIM TO A FINAL FOUR.

42:42.266 --> 42:43.800
TODD, AS WELL.

42:43.800 --> 42:45.767
THAT'S WHAT I WOULD FIGURE.

42:45.767 --> 42:47.934
THEN I COULDN'T TELL BECAUSE
ONCE HE DIDN'T PUT ME AND CARSON

42:47.934 --> 42:48.100
ONCE HE DIDN'T PUT ME AND CARSON UP.

42:48.100 --> 42:49.400
UP.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.400
I THINK IT WAS JUST THAT IF

42:52.400 --> 42:55.100
YOU PULLED YOURSELF DOWN, THAT
IT WOULD DIRECTLY SEND HER HOME.

42:55.100 --> 42:55.400
IT WOULD DIRECTLY SEND HER HOME. RIGHT.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.667
RIGHT.

42:57.667 --> 42:59.734
AT LEAST WE KNOW.

42:59.734 --> 43:01.467
YOU ALREADY ARE COMMITTED, WE
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T GET A FINAL

43:01.467 --> 43:01.667
OBVIOUSLY CAN'T GET A FINAL FOUR.

43:01.667 --> 43:02.867
FOUR.

43:02.867 --> 43:03.266
WHICH WE RESPECT THAT.

43:03.266 --> 43:05.166
THANK YOU.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.233
WE HAD TO ASK.

43:06.233 --> 43:09.533
LET'S JUST LEAVE THE SLATE
THE SAME.

43:09.533 --> 43:10.066
THE SAME. WAIT.

43:10.066 --> 43:11.834
WAIT.

43:11.834 --> 43:13.433
YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THE

43:13.433 --> 43:15.767
NOMINATIONS THE SAME?

43:15.767 --> 43:20.233
WHICH MEANS THAT CARSON STAYS ON

43:20.233 --> 43:20.567
THE BLOCK?

43:20.567 --> 43:21.567
THANKS.

43:21.567 --> 43:29.000
YEAH, I THINK I MIGHT BE ABLE
TO DO THAT FOR YOU GUYS.

43:29.000 --> 43:29.233
TO DO THAT FOR YOU GUYS. OK.

43:29.233 --> 43:32.033
OK.

43:32.033 --> 43:35.166
SO THIS IS WHAT WE DO.
WE DON'T ROCK THE BOAT NOW AT

43:35.166 --> 43:35.533
WE DON'T ROCK THE BOAT NOW AT ALL.

43:35.533 --> 43:37.467
ALL.

43:37.467 --> 43:39.800
AND WE STAY UNDER THE RADAR

43:39.800 --> 43:40.567
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO USE

43:40.567 --> 43:42.400
THE POWER OF VETO.
LEAVE IT THE WAY IT IS.

43:42.400 --> 43:42.633
LEAVE IT THE WAY IT IS. OK.

43:42.633 --> 43:45.100
OK.
LET'S GET THROUGH THIS MEETING.

43:45.100 --> 43:45.333
LET'S GET THROUGH THIS MEETING. OK.

43:45.333 --> 43:47.934
OK.
THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO PLAN B.

43:47.934 --> 43:48.533
THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO PLAN B. OK.

43:48.533 --> 43:48.900
OK.
ALL RIGHT.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.734
ALL RIGHT. OK.

43:50.734 --> 43:53.133
OK.

43:53.133 --> 43:57.367
GOOD JOB.

43:57.367 --> 44:07.467
OH, MY GOD!

44:20.433 --> 44:28.800
HEY, FRIENDS, TIME FOR THE VVETOMEETING.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.433
VVETOMEETING.

44:30.433 --> 44:35.066
HEY, FRIENDS, TIME FOR THE

44:35.066 --> 44:37.033
VETO MEETING.

44:37.033 --> 44:39.633
THIS IS THE VETO MEETING.

44:39.633 --> 44:40.800
CARSON AND LAMAR HAVE BEEN

44:40.800 --> 44:42.400
NOMINATED FOR EVICTION, BUT I

44:42.400 --> 44:46.433
HAVE THE POWER TO VETO ONE OF

44:46.433 --> 44:51.000
THE NOMINATIONS.

44:51.000 --> 44:55.066
I HAVE DECIDED ... NOT TO USE

44:55.066 --> 44:56.934
THE POWER OF VETO.

44:56.934 --> 44:59.834
I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECT THE

44:59.834 --> 45:01.900
CURRENT HOH'S NOMINATIONS.

45:01.900 --> 45:02.834
AND LEAVE THEM THE SAME.

45:02.834 --> 45:03.600
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A

45:03.600 --> 45:04.900
WONDERFUL GAME.

45:04.900 --> 45:09.500
AND WE'LL LEAVE IT TO THE JURY

45:09.500 --> 45:17.333
TO DECIDE.

45:17.333 --> 45:18.533
THIS VETO MEETING IS ADJOURNED.

45:18.533 --> 45:20.967
I DON'T THINK YOU COULD HAVE

45:20.967 --> 45:21.200
PAID ME ENOUGH TO USE THIS VETO.

45:21.200 --> 45:24.300
WHY?
BECAUSE CARSON IS SITTING ON THE

45:24.300 --> 45:24.567
BECAUSE CARSON IS SITTING ON THE BLOCK.

45:24.567 --> 45:26.266
BLOCK.

45:26.266 --> 45:28.233
ALL TODRICK AND I NEED TO DO IS

45:28.233 --> 45:30.000
CAST OUR VOTES AND CARSON WILL

45:30.000 --> 45:33.834
BE HEADING OUT THAT DOOR.

45:33.834 --> 45:37.967
I'M STILL ON THE BLOCK.

45:37.967 --> 45:39.166
I ALWAYS TOOK PRIDE IN DEFENCE.

45:39.166 --> 45:39.767
I'M CONFIDENT I'LL SURPRISE ONE

45:39.767 --> 45:41.900
MORE DAY.

45:41.900 --> 45:44.233
I PROMISE YOU YOU WON'T GET ME

45:44.233 --> 45:46.166
ON THE BLOCK AGAIN.

45:46.166 --> 45:48.467
CARSON HAS BEEN SAVED BY THE

45:48.467 --> 45:50.533
VETO TWO TIMES BEFORE.

45:50.533 --> 45:52.033
MIESHA JUST SEALED THE DEAL WE

45:52.033 --> 45:53.800
CAN TAKE OUR SHOT.

45:53.800 --> 45:56.266
EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

45:56.266 --> 45:57.533
CARSON IS VERY, VERY PERSUASIVE.

45:57.533 --> 46:01.033
SO MUCH COULD HAPPEN IN THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS.

46:01.033 --> 46:04.133
COUPLE OF DAYS. THE.

46:04.133 --> 46:05.133
THE.

46:05.133 --> 46:06.600
MIESHA DID NOT USE THE POWER

46:06.600 --> 46:08.900
OF VETO ON ME.
THAT MEANS THAT CYNTHIA REMAINS

46:08.900 --> 46:09.100
THAT MEANS THAT CYNTHIA REMAINS SAFE.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.967
SAFE.
THE TWO OF US CAN SPRING INTO

46:10.967 --> 46:20.033
THE TWO OF US CAN SPRING INTO ACTION.

46:20.033 --> 46:22.467
ACTION.
THAT WORKED OUT AS BEST AS IT

46:22.467 --> 46:22.667
THAT WORKED OUT AS BEST AS IT COULD.

46:22.667 --> 46:23.567
COULD.

46:23.567 --> 46:25.266
VERY MUCH SO.

46:25.266 --> 46:26.967
WE HAVE TO HAVE A SIT DOWN,

46:26.967 --> 46:29.967
YOU, ME AND TODRICK.

46:29.967 --> 46:31.500

46:31.500 --> 46:32.200
PACT TO TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER

46:32.200 --> 46:33.934

NOW IS YOUR CHANCE.

46:33.934 --> 46:34.300
NOW IS YOUR CHANCE. RIGHT.

46:34.300 --> 46:35.300
RIGHT.

46:35.300 --> 46:38.367
TO STAY IN THE HOUSE I NEED

46:38.367 --> 46:38.633
TO GET TWO VOTES DURING THE EVICTION.

46:38.633 --> 46:42.200
EVICTION.

46:42.200 --> 46:48.233
I ALREADY HAVE CYNTHIA'S.
IF I CAN EQUI CONVINCE TODRICK,I

46:48.233 --> 46:50.500

48:47.867 --> 48:50.834
IT'S NOT SURPRISING.

48:50.834 --> 48:52.166
I KNOW TODRICK VERY WELL.

HIS GAME PLAY?
TODRICK WANTS TO CONTROL

49:04.200 --> 49:04.700
TODRICK WANTS TO CONTROL EVERYTHING.

49:04.700 --> 49:06.433

49:06.433 --> 49:08.166

49:14.300 --> 49:15.300
WEEK TWO OR WHATEVER THAT WAS.

49:15.300 --> 49:16.867
WHICH WAS A SHOCKER.

49:16.867 --> 49:17.767
I'M SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TRY TO

49:17.767 --> 49:19.100
CONTROL THINGS.

49:19.100 --> 49:20.600
I TRY TO LET LIFE HAPPEN.
THEN I TRY TO REACT TO WHAT

49:20.600 --> 49:20.834
THEN I TRY TO REACT TO WHAT HAPPENS.

49:20.834 --> 49:21.700
HAPPENS.

49:21.700 --> 49:24.834
HE'S BEEN CONTROLLING.
IT'S BEEN WORKING FOR HIM,

49:24.834 --> 49:25.166
IT'S BEEN WORKING FOR HIM, THOUGH.

49:25.166 --> 49:26.266

Julie: WHAT HAS STOOD OUT

49:27.066 --> 49:30.967
ABOUT THIS SEASON?

49:30.967 --> 49:32.300
WHAT ARE HIGHLIGHTS?

49:32.300 --> 49:34.600
SOME OF THE THINGS I LOVED

49:34.600 --> 49:36.033
WHEN TODRICK GAVE TODD THE POWER

49:36.033 --> 49:38.667
OF VETO.
TODD WAS - SO MUCH PURE JOY

49:38.667 --> 49:38.867
TODD WAS - SO MUCH PURE JOY THERE.

49:38.867 --> 49:40.133
THERE.

49:40.133 --> 49:43.000
I LOVE THOSE MOMENTS.

49:53.200 --> 49:53.433
HOH LAST WEEK, HE GOT THIS PRO PROVIDO.

49:53.433 --> 49:55.700
PROVIDO.

49:55.700 --> 49:57.367

49:57.367 --> 49:59.433
I'M PLEASED TO SEE CYNTHIA
GETTING INTO THIS GAME AND

49:59.433 --> 49:59.834

50:03.367 --> 50:04.266
DIFFERENT FROM ANY OTHER

50:04.266 --> 50:05.467

50:05.467 --> 50:06.633
YOU'RE LIVING IN THERE FROM

50:06.633 --> 50:10.433
YOU'RE ISOLATED.

50:10.433 --> 50:12.500
THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

50:12.500 --> 50:13.633
I'M A D-LIST ACTOR.

50:13.633 --> 50:14.367
I WORK ON A SET.

50:14.367 --> 50:16.734
I GO TO A MOTEL.

50:16.734 --> 50:17.433
AT LEAST I HAVE THAT -

50:17.433 --> 50:18.834
Julie: PRIVATE TIME.

50:18.834 --> 50:20.133
PRIVATE TIME OR A TRAILER.
THERE'S NO PRIVATE TIME IN THIS

50:20.133 --> 50:20.533
THERE'S NO PRIVATE TIME IN THIS HOUSE.

50:20.533 --> 50:23.266
HOUSE.
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF

50:23.266 --> 50:23.567
IT TAKES A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSONALITY.

50:23.567 --> 50:24.533
PERSONALITY.

50:24.533 --> 50:25.934
Julie: I THINK THEY'RE ALL

50:25.934 --> 50:27.000
SHOCKED HOW HARD THIS IS

50:27.000 --> 50:28.367
COMPARED TO ANY OTHER THING THEY

50:28.367 --> 50:31.133
HAVE DONE IN THEIR LIFE.

50:31.133 --> 50:32.700
THEY'RE ALL WINNERS IN THEIR OWN

50:32.700 --> 50:34.533
CORNERS OF WHATEVER FORM OF

50:34.533 --> 50:37.100
ENTERTAINMENT THEY DO.

50:37.100 --> 50:38.400
LISTEN, PEOPLE IN THERE HAVE

50:38.400 --> 50:40.533
CHAMPIONSHIP RINGS.

50:40.533 --> 50:41.934

50:41.934 --> 50:43.834
Julie: LAMAR HAS TWO.
HE HASN'T WON A SINGLE

50:43.834 --> 50:44.133
HE HASN'T WON A SINGLE COMPETITION.

50:44.133 --> 50:45.467

I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM TONIGHT

50:59.533 --> 51:00.900
WERE, YOU WOULD SAY KIRKPATRICK

51:00.900 --> 51:02.867
IS GOING TO WIN.

51:02.867 --> 51:04.100
HE SECRETLY KNOWS HOW TO PLAY

51:04.100 --> 51:05.867
THE GAME.

51:05.867 --> 51:08.400
SHANEA, THAT TURN OF EVENTS,

51:08.400 --> 51:10.900
WATCHING HER GET VOTED OUT, IT

51:10.900 --> 51:12.900
WAS LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE IN

51:12.900 --> 51:14.834
QUICKSAND OR A WHIRLPOOL.

51:14.834 --> 51:15.934
Julie: WAS IT FAIR OR UNFAIR

51:15.934 --> 51:17.467
WHAT HAPPENED TO SHANNA?

51:17.467 --> 51:20.700
WHAT DO YOU THINK HOW SHE

51:20.700 --> 51:23.467
SUPPLIED AND GOT EVICTED?

51:23.467 --> 51:24.767

51:24.767 --> 51:26.000
UNFAIR IN THE BIG BROTHER HOUSE,

51:27.000 --> 51:28.266

51:38.300 --> 51:39.033
INCREDIBLE.

51:39.033 --> 51:40.066
Julie: GET OUT OF THE

KITCHEN, PEOPLE!

51:41.734 --> 51:44.934
IT'S BIG BROTHER.

51:44.934 --> 51:47.000
YOU CAN'T PREDICT IT, BUT I WAS

51:47.000 --> 51:48.900
SHOCKED WHEN SHANNA LEFT.
THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TURN OF

51:48.900 --> 51:49.233
THAT WAS AN INCREDIBLE TURN OF EVENTS.

51:49.233 --> 51:51.266
EVENTS.

51:51.266 --> 51:52.767
IT MADE ME TUNE IN THIS WEEK.

51:52.767 --> 51:55.367
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

51:55.367 --> 51:56.133
TONIGHT WITH LAMAR, CARSON BOTH

51:56.133 --> 51:56.700
UP THERE.

51:56.700 --> 51:57.767
Julie: I'M GOING TO GO

51:57.767 --> 51:58.500
THROUGH THE NAMES OF THE PEOPLE

51:58.500 --> 52:00.600
LEFT IN THE HOUSE.
YOU TELL ME YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF

52:00.600 --> 52:00.800
YOU TELL ME YOUR IMPRESSIONS OF THEM.

52:00.800 --> 52:03.867
THEM.

52:03.867 --> 52:07.233
LET'S START WITH CARSON.

52:07.233 --> 52:09.467
HE IS GREAT.
AGAIN, HE'S STUCK TO HIS GAME

52:09.467 --> 52:09.667
AGAIN, HE'S STUCK TO HIS GAME PLAN.

52:09.667 --> 52:11.633
PLAN.

52:11.633 --> 52:12.900
HE MADE AN ALLIANCE EARLY ON.
HE STUCK TO IT.

52:12.900 --> 52:13.467
HE STUCK TO IT. SURVIVING.

52:13.467 --> 52:14.333
SURVIVING.

52:14.333 --> 52:15.100
LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A

52:15.100 --> 52:15.667
POSSIBILITY HE WILL MAKE IT OUT

52:15.667 --> 52:17.400
OF TONIGHT.

52:17.400 --> 52:18.967
I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT HE WOULD

52:18.967 --> 52:19.633
NEVER MADE IT OUT OF.

52:19.633 --> 52:21.700
Julie: CYNTHIA, HIS BEST

52:21.700 --> 52:22.533
FRIEND IN THE HOUSE.

52:22.533 --> 52:24.066
CYNTHIA, WHO I KNOW

52:24.066 --> 52:25.567
PERSONALLY AND LOVE, BEAUTIFUL.

52:25.567 --> 52:28.900
COVER OF MAGAZINES.

52:28.900 --> 52:31.767
THE QUEEN OF EMPIRES.

52:31.767 --> 52:33.834
CYNTHIA BAILEY EYEWEAR.

52:33.834 --> 52:35.433
I HAVE GLASSES FROM HER LINE.

52:35.433 --> 52:36.800
I DON'T THINK CYNTHIA'S HEART

52:36.800 --> 52:38.200
WAS REALLY IN IT.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.900
I THINK IT'S A LOT TO ASK YOUR

52:39.900 --> 52:41.734
FAMILY AND BE ISOLATED.
YOU CAN'T EVEN FACE TIME WITH

52:41.734 --> 52:42.266
YOU CAN'T EVEN FACE TIME WITH PEOPLE.

52:42.266 --> 52:43.333
PEOPLE.

52:43.333 --> 52:43.767
TONIGHT SEEING CYNTHIA JUMP OUT

52:43.767 --> 52:44.500
OF BID.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.000
THIS IS IT.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.200
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

52:47.200 --> 52:48.934
Julie: SHE WOKE UP.

52:48.934 --> 52:50.900
NOW I'M GOING TO GET TO SEE

52:50.900 --> 52:53.934
THE CYNTHIA I HAVE BEEN WATCHING

52:53.934 --> 52:56.800
FOR YEARS.

52:56.800 --> 53:03.100
Julie: MIESHA "CUPCAKE" TATE.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.600
MIESHA IS AN ALPHA PERSON.

53:04.600 --> 53:06.533
IT'S BEEN WORKING.

53:06.533 --> 53:11.100
TODD GETS THE HOH.
MIESHA KICKS OPENS THE BATH ROOM

53:11.100 --> 53:11.300
MIESHA KICKS OPENS THE BATH ROOM DOOR.

53:11.300 --> 53:12.967
DOOR.

53:12.967 --> 53:14.834
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

53:14.834 --> 53:16.734
NOT TODD CAN I TALK TO YOU.

53:16.734 --> 53:19.533
GOES UP TO TODD, YOU'RE PUTTING

53:19.533 --> 53:21.266
UP CARSON AND A PAWN.

53:21.266 --> 53:23.867
PUT UP LAMAR.

53:23.867 --> 53:24.767
HE'S THE PAWN.

53:24.767 --> 53:26.467
ALPHA COMPETITOR.

53:26.467 --> 53:28.834
I WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR MIESHA HAS
TO LOSE MORE WEIGHT FOR HER

53:28.834 --> 53:29.033
TO LOSE MORE WEIGHT FOR HER FIGHT.

53:29.033 --> 53:31.900
FIGHT.

53:31.900 --> 53:33.533
MIESHA WORKED OUT MORE ON BIG

53:33.533 --> 53:36.233
BROTHER THAN I HAVE WORKED OUT

53:36.233 --> 53:36.500
THIS LAST DECADE.

53:36.500 --> 53:39.100
Julie: WE TALKED ABOUT TODRICK.

53:39.100 --> 53:39.834
TODRICK.

53:39.834 --> 53:43.000
TODD BRINGS.

53:43.000 --> 53:44.934
IT WAS FUN TO SEE HIM WIN HOH

53:44.934 --> 53:46.567
AND SO HEAR HE'S IN IT.

53:46.567 --> 53:48.433
HE SEEMED LIKE A FLOATER.

53:48.433 --> 53:49.133
HE WASN'T IN IT.

53:49.133 --> 53:50.900
MAYBE -

53:50.900 --> 53:53.800
Julie: EXPECT THE UNEXPECTED.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.433
MAYBE HE WAS PLAYING COY.

53:55.433 --> 53:56.567
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLY

53:56.567 --> 53:58.433
PUTTING HIM UP TONIGHT.

53:58.433 --> 53:58.834
HE'S A THREAT.

53:58.834 --> 54:01.734
Julie: LAMAR.

54:03.367 --> 54:06.934
I LOVE LAMY.

54:06.934 --> 54:08.200
WATCHING THE SHOW, AS HE
DESCRIBED, SOMEONE WHO HAS

54:08.200 --> 54:08.533
DESCRIBED, SOMEONE WHO HAS REGRETS.

54:08.533 --> 54:10.934
REGRETS.
I HATE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO HAS

54:10.934 --> 54:11.166
I HATE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO HAS REGRETS.

54:11.166 --> 54:12.467
REGRETS.

54:12.467 --> 54:13.834
I WAS PULLING FOR HIM.

54:13.834 --> 54:14.567
I'M REALLY PULLING FOR HIM IN

54:14.567 --> 54:16.033
THIS HOUSE.

54:16.033 --> 54:16.633
IT WOULD BE GREAT IF HE WON THIS

54:16.633 --> 54:19.734
WHOLE THING.
IT WOULD PROPEL HIM INTO A NEW

54:19.734 --> 54:20.600
IT WOULD PROPEL HIM INTO A NEW STAGE.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.333
STAGE.

54:21.333 --> 54:24.600
Julie: ANY CHANCE YOU THINK

54:24.600 --> 54:26.367
HE AND CHLOE WILL BE BACK

54:26.367 --> 54:26.667
TOGETHER?

54:26.667 --> 54:28.033
KARDASHIAN?

54:28.033 --> 54:30.667
I THINK HE HAS A BETTER

54:30.667 --> 54:32.233
CHANCE OF WINNING BIG BROTHER

54:32.233 --> 54:33.166
ACCORDING TO SOCIAL MEDIA.

54:33.166 --> 54:33.567
Julie: LAST FEW SECONDS, CALL

54:33.567 --> 54:37.700
IT NOW.

54:37.700 --> 54:38.834
WHO IS GOING TO WIN THIS IN YOUR

54:38.834 --> 54:40.433
OPINION?
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LAMAR WIN

54:40.433 --> 54:40.700
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE LAMAR WIN IT.

54:40.700 --> 54:42.066
IT.

54:42.066 --> 54:44.900
BUT THAT IS A REAL LONG SHOT AT

54:44.900 --> 54:47.233
THIS POINT.
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CYNTHIA WIN

54:47.233 --> 54:47.967
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE CYNTHIA WIN IT.

54:47.967 --> 54:48.433
IT.

54:48.433 --> 54:50.467
Julie: ALL RIGHT.

54:50.467 --> 54:52.767
YOU HEARD IT HERE.

54:52.767 --> 54:53.800
JERRY O'CONNELL SAID IF WE DO

54:53.800 --> 54:54.600
ANOTHER CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER,

54:54.600 --> 54:56.033
HE'S GOING IN.

54:56.033 --> 54:56.567
WHERE DO I SIGN?

54:56.567 --> 54:57.533
Julie: ALL RIGHT.

54:57.533 --> 54:59.900
STAY RIGHT THERE.

54:59.900 --> 55:00.734
UP NEXT, CARSON AND CYNTHIA GET

55:00.734 --> 55:02.333
TO WORK.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.500
CAN THEY FLIP THE VOTE?

55:04.500 --> 55:06.767
THEN, IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER

55:06.767 --> 55:08.233
CELEBRITY TO BE SHOWN THE DOOR.

55:08.233 --> 55:10.066
PLUS, THOSE STILL IN THE GAME

55:10.066 --> 55:11.734
WILL GET SOME MUCH NEEDED LOVE

55:11.734 --> 55:13.467
FROM HOME.

55:13.467 --> 55:17.734
STAY WITH US.

55:26.533 --> 55:29.433
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

55:29.433 --> 55:32.066
CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER.

55:32.066 --> 55:33.200
THE POWER OF VETO SEEMED TO BE

55:33.200 --> 55:34.600
CARSON'S LAST CHANCE TO STAY IN

55:34.600 --> 55:36.100
THE GAME.

55:36.100 --> 55:42.367
OR WAS IT?

55:43.400 --> 55:45.333
BIG BROTHER SHOWS THE HOUSE

55:45.333 --> 55:47.100
GUESTS A LOT OF LOVE WHEN IT

55:47.100 --> 55:57.633
COMES TO FOOD AND SNACKS.
I CAN MAKE ANYTHING AT ANY TIME.

56:06.533 --> 56:15.367
I DON'T EVEN REALLY COOK, BUT

56:15.367 --> 56:16.734
YOU HAVE TO BE LIKE McGIVOR TO

56:16.734 --> 56:19.400
WORK THAT SHOW.

56:19.400 --> 56:20.700
DYOU PUSH IT AND TURN IT.
IT'S EASIER THAN A COMPUTER

56:20.700 --> 56:21.000
IT'S EASIER THAN A COMPUTER STORE.

56:21.000 --> 56:27.367
STORE.

56:27.367 --> 56:37.400
MAKES NO SENSE TO ME.

56:45.734 --> 56:46.633
MAN, I WISH THERE WAS A BIG

56:46.633 --> 56:48.500
BROTHER CHEF.

56:48.500 --> 56:54.967
CAN WE GET A BIG BROTHER CHEF IN

56:54.967 --> 57:00.400
HERE?

57:02.066 --> 57:06.300
I THINK AFTER WE GET CARSON
OUT THIS WEEK, I'M THINKING

57:06.300 --> 57:15.633
OUT THIS WEEK, I'M THINKING TODD.

57:15.633 --> 57:16.400
TODD.

57:17.533 --> 57:18.400
I HAVE HAD A GREAT WORKING

57:18.400 --> 57:19.934
RELATIONSHIP WITH TODD.

57:19.934 --> 57:21.700
BUT I HAVE A FEELING IF TODD

57:21.700 --> 57:24.266
GETS POWER AGAIN, HE MIGHT JUST

57:24.266 --> 57:26.934
COME KNOCKING ON MY DOOR AND TRY

57:26.934 --> 57:28.600
TO PUT ME ON THE BLOCK.

57:28.600 --> 57:32.066
IT MIGHT MAKE SENSE TO TARGET

57:32.066 --> 57:34.133
HIM BEFORE HE CAN TARGET ME.

57:34.133 --> 57:36.367
VOTE TODD OUT BECAUSE HE'S

57:36.367 --> 57:38.367
MOST LIKELY TO WIN BETWEEN

57:38.367 --> 57:40.633
CYNTHIA AND LAMAR?

57:40.633 --> 57:42.333
DO YOU SEE WHERE THAT MAKES

57:42.333 --> 57:42.633
SENSE?

57:42.633 --> 57:45.600
1,000%.

57:45.600 --> 57:48.967
HE IS RISING UP AND WINNING
HOHs AND ALMOST WINNING

57:48.967 --> 57:49.200
HOHs AND ALMOST WINNING VETOES.

57:49.200 --> 57:50.567
VETOES.

57:50.567 --> 57:53.133
CONSIDER IT.

57:53.133 --> 57:58.667
I LOVE TODD.

57:58.667 --> 58:01.467
LAMAR AND TODD UP IF WE WIN.

58:03.266 --> 58:06.500
QUITE THE DAY.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.033
THIS EXPERIENCE HAS JUST BEEN A

58:08.033 --> 58:10.200
LOT MORE DIFFICULT THAN I

58:10.200 --> 58:12.100
EXPECTED IT TO BE.
COME IN.

58:12.100 --> 58:13.100
COME IN. HI.

58:16.834 --> 58:21.800
HI.
COME SEE US.

58:21.800 --> 58:26.033
COME SEE US. OK.

58:26.033 --> 58:30.500
OK.

58:32.600 --> 58:33.934
HELLO.

58:33.934 --> 58:34.800
WE HAVE AN INTERESTING LAST
DITCH HOPE.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.433
DITCH HOPE. OK.

58:36.433 --> 58:38.133
OK.

58:38.133 --> 58:39.433
THAT CAN HELP YOUR END GAME.

58:39.433 --> 58:40.233
BECAUSE I TOLD YOU FROM THE

58:40.233 --> 58:40.934
BEGINNING WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE

58:40.934 --> 58:42.300
YOU WIN THIS.

58:42.300 --> 58:43.433
I KNOW YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO GO

58:43.433 --> 58:44.767
TO THE END.

58:44.767 --> 58:47.033
OBVIOUS, YES.

58:47.033 --> 58:48.567
WE BELIEVE WHOLEHEARTEDLY.
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY A BIT

58:48.567 --> 58:48.867
I WOULD LOVE TO STAY A BIT LONGER.

58:48.867 --> 58:51.000
LONGER.

58:51.000 --> 58:53.433
I KNOW THAT'S GOING NOT GOING TO

58:53.433 --> 58:55.700
MESH WITH MIESHA.

58:55.700 --> 58:55.934
WE RESPECT YOUR RELATIONSHIP

58:55.934 --> 58:57.667
1,000%.

58:57.667 --> 59:00.500
WHEN WE HAD OUR SIDE DEAL.

59:00.500 --> 59:01.533
WE NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR EACH

59:01.533 --> 59:03.934
OTHER, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME.

59:03.934 --> 59:05.834
VOTE TO KEEP ME HERE AT THE

59:05.834 --> 59:07.433
EVICTION, THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

59:07.433 --> 59:09.734
WE WOULD DEFINITELY GUARANTEE

59:09.734 --> 59:11.767
YOU OUR VOTES ON THE JURY.

59:11.767 --> 59:13.834
AT THE END.

59:13.834 --> 59:15.367
IF THERE WAS A WORLD WHERE WE

59:15.367 --> 59:17.900
WERE GOING TO FLIP THE VOTE AND

59:17.900 --> 59:19.200
KEEP YOU HERE INSTEAD OF LAMAR.

59:19.200 --> 59:21.600
I DON'T KNOW AT THIS POINT.

59:21.600 --> 59:24.100
I'M SITTING OVER GOING WHAT AM I

59:24.100 --> 59:25.100
GOING TO DO WHEN THEY'RE GONE?

59:25.100 --> 59:26.567
WE'RE LESS DANGEROUS THAN

59:26.567 --> 59:31.066
THEY ARE.

59:31.066 --> 59:32.400
THOSE TWO ARE GUNNING FOR YOU.

59:32.400 --> 59:34.166
GAME LEVEL YOU'RE THE

59:34.166 --> 59:36.000
SCARIEST PERSON TO SIT NEXT TO.
I'M NOT THAT BAD.

59:36.000 --> 59:36.300
I'M NOT THAT BAD. CARSON.

59:36.300 --> 59:39.533
CARSON.

59:39.533 --> 59:42.767
I WON ONE THING.

59:42.767 --> 59:44.300
DESPERATE TIMES CALL FOR

59:44.300 --> 59:47.500
DESPERATE TIMES.

59:47.500 --> 59:49.166
CLEARLY CARSON AND CYNTHIA ARE

59:49.166 --> 59:52.500
CLUTCHING AT STRAWS.

59:52.500 --> 59:54.433
DO THE MATH.

59:54.433 --> 59:55.867
YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO WIN THE

59:55.867 --> 59:57.266
REMAINING HOHs.
BE IN CONTROL AND IN THE FINAL

59:57.266 --> 59:57.500
BE IN CONTROL AND IN THE FINAL TWO.

59:57.500 --> 59:58.800
TWO.

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.033
I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE THIS

1:00:00.033 --> 1:00:03.367
DECISION COMPLETELY ON MY OWN.

1:00:03.367 --> 1:00:04.700
I GOT TO TALK TO MY GIRL MIESHA

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:05.900
AND SEE WHAT SHE THINKS.

1:00:05.900 --> 1:00:16.367
JUST GOING ON THE RECORD

1:00:16.367 --> 1:00:18.367
SAYING WE'RE SUPPORTING YOU.
WE'RE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.

1:00:18.367 --> 1:00:18.633
WE'RE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL. YEAH.

1:00:18.633 --> 1:00:20.800
YEAH.

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:22.133
WHY NOT?

1:00:22.133 --> 1:00:23.967
CARSON AND CYNTHIA PULLED ME
INTO THEIR ROOM TO TALK TO GO

1:00:23.967 --> 1:00:27.066
INTO THEIR ROOM TO TALK TO GO ME.

1:00:27.066 --> 1:00:27.633
ME.

1:00:27.633 --> 1:00:30.233
ABOUT?
ABOUT POSSIBLY GIVING THEM MY

1:00:30.233 --> 1:00:30.433
ABOUT POSSIBLY GIVING THEM MY VOTE.

1:00:30.433 --> 1:00:32.667
VOTE.

1:00:32.667 --> 1:00:32.900
WHAT WAS THEIR PROPOSAL

1:00:32.900 --> 1:00:34.567
THOUGH?

1:00:34.567 --> 1:00:35.867
WAS THERE A PROPOSAL OR JUST

1:00:35.867 --> 1:00:38.734
AN ASK?
MORE OF AN ASK THAN A

1:00:38.734 --> 1:00:39.000
MORE OF AN ASK THAN A PROPOSAL.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:44.300
PROPOSAL.

1:00:44.300 --> 1:00:47.800
I COULD USE TWO JURY VOTES,

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:48.967
ESPECIALLY IF SHANNA MAKES GOOD

1:00:48.967 --> 1:00:50.600
ON HER PARTING SHOT.

1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:52.567
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY I CAN WRAP

1:00:52.567 --> 1:00:54.633
THIS LIKE NOT THAT GREAT PITCH

1:00:54.633 --> 1:00:57.433
INTO A PRETTY BOW AND SELL IT TO

1:00:57.433 --> 1:00:58.400
MIESHA AND MAYBE SHE'LL BUY IT.

1:00:58.400 --> 1:00:59.767
HE WAS LIKE WE'RE NOT GOING

1:00:59.767 --> 1:01:01.333
TO WIN THIS GAME.

1:01:01.333 --> 1:01:01.667
WE ALREADY KNOW IT.

1:01:01.667 --> 1:01:03.333
I DON'T KNOW.

1:01:03.333 --> 1:01:04.633
PART OF ME THAT'S LIKE

1:01:04.633 --> 1:01:05.567
CONSIDERING IT.

1:01:05.567 --> 1:01:07.633
I THINK WE WOULD HAVE A BETTER

1:01:07.633 --> 1:01:11.367
CHANCE AT TAKING TODD OUT WITH

1:01:11.367 --> 1:01:12.467
CARSON HERE ON OUR TEAM.

1:01:12.467 --> 1:01:14.033
IF TODD WINS, I DON'T THINK

1:01:14.033 --> 1:01:15.834
THERE ARE ANY AGREEMENTS HE

1:01:15.834 --> 1:01:17.467
WOULD STICK TO AT THIS POINT.
TODRICK IS MAKING A VALID

1:01:17.467 --> 1:01:18.200
TODRICK IS MAKING A VALID POINT.

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:21.367
POINT.

1:01:21.367 --> 1:01:23.333
TODD IS A BIT OF A LATE BLOOMER.

1:01:23.333 --> 1:01:24.867
BUT HE'S DEFINITELY POSED

1:01:24.867 --> 1:01:28.133
HIMSELF AS A REAL THREAT.

1:01:28.133 --> 1:01:30.400
HOWEVER, CARSON HAS TO GO FIRST.

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:32.367
I JUST REALLY HOPE TODRICK

1:01:32.367 --> 1:01:34.667
ISN'T CONSIDERING THIS DEAL.

1:01:34.667 --> 1:01:36.066
BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S TODRICK'S

1:01:36.066 --> 1:01:37.166
VOTE THAT WILL DECIDE WHO LEAVES

1:01:37.166 --> 1:01:38.967
THE HOUSE.

1:01:38.967 --> 1:01:40.767
DO YOU THINK THERE'S EVEN A

1:01:40.767 --> 1:01:41.066
WORLD WHERE SHE WOULD CONSIDER

1:01:41.066 --> 1:01:43.266
THIS?

1:01:43.266 --> 1:01:45.800
IF WE KEEP CARSON, THAT'S

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:48.200
SUCH A BIG THREAT.

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:50.266
I KNOW.
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE MY

1:01:50.266 --> 1:01:50.467
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CHANGE MY VOTE.

1:01:50.467 --> 1:01:58.033
VOTE.

1:01:58.033 --> 1:01:59.133
HE WOULD STAY.
WE'RE DEFINITELY PLAYING WITH

1:01:59.133 --> 1:01:59.433
WE'RE DEFINITELY PLAYING WITH FIRE.

1:01:59.433 --> 1:02:01.200
FIRE.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:08.567
I REALLY WISH I KNEW WHAT I

1:02:08.567 --> 1:02:11.166
THINK IS THE BEST.

1:02:11.166 --> 1:02:13.767
Julie: WHEN WE RETURN, CARSON

1:02:13.767 --> 1:02:17.867
OR LAMAR, WHO IS HEADED HOME?
STAY WITH US.

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:32.734
Julie: WELCOME BACK TO

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:40.467
FOR ONE OF THEM TONIGHT WILL BE

1:02:40.467 --> 1:02:41.734
THEIR LAST.

1:02:41.734 --> 1:02:44.834
LET'S HEAD TO THE LIVING ROOM

1:02:44.834 --> 1:02:46.000

1:02:52.200 --> 1:02:54.934
EVICTION.

1:02:54.934 --> 1:02:56.300

BUT, BEFORE THEY DO, YOU EACH

1:03:04.033 --> 1:03:07.333
HAVE A FINAL CHANCE TO SWAY
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF

1:03:07.333 --> 1:03:08.433
THEIR VOTES WITH ONE BRIEF STATEMENT.

1:03:08.433 --> 1:03:09.967
STATEMENT.
CARSON, YOU'RE FIRST.

1:03:09.967 --> 1:03:10.200
CARSON, YOU'RE FIRST. OK.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:11.033
OK.

1:03:11.033 --> 1:03:11.700
I DON'T KNOW HOW BRIEF THIS IS

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:14.333
GOING TO BE.

1:03:14.333 --> 1:03:15.633

1:03:27.734 --> 1:03:32.633
EVER SAID.

1:03:32.633 --> 1:03:34.700
I'M TAKING IT AS A COMPLIMENT

1:03:34.700 --> 1:03:35.700
THAT I'M THAT MUCH OF A FORCE TO

1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:47.633
YOU KNOW EVERYONE IN THE BUSINESS.

1:08:47.633 --> 1:08:49.934
BUSINESS.

1:08:49.934 --> 1:08:50.767
I GO EVERYWHERE WITH MURRAY.

1:08:50.767 --> 1:08:53.133
Julie: CARSON, I KNOW THEY
GAVE YOU A HEADS-UP YOU WERE

1:08:53.133 --> 1:08:53.433
GAVE YOU A HEADS-UP YOU WERE GOING.

1:08:53.433 --> 1:08:56.066
GOING.

1:08:56.066 --> 1:08:57.934
BUT IT'S NOT FUN TO GET EVICTED.

1:08:57.934 --> 1:08:59.433
HOW ARE YOU FEELING RIGHT NOW?

1:08:59.433 --> 1:09:01.033
SO MANY EMOTIONS, HONESTLY.

1:09:01.033 --> 1:09:01.934
I MADE SO MANY GREAT FRIENDS IN

1:09:01.934 --> 1:09:04.166
THE HOUSE.

1:09:04.166 --> 1:09:05.500
IT'S A WEIRD PECULIAR

1:09:05.500 --> 1:09:06.800
EXPERIENCE, BECAUSE THAT HOUSE

1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:12.500
BECOMES YOUR WORLD.

1:09:12.500 --> 1:09:13.800
YOU HAVE KNO - NO EMAIL.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:14.800
NO FRIENDS OR FAMILY.

1:09:14.800 --> 1:09:17.033
YOU BECOME INVESTED.

1:09:17.033 --> 1:09:19.200
THEN YOU HAVE TO GET RID OF
PEOPLE WHICH IS USUALLY REALLY

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:19.467
PEOPLE WHICH IS USUALLY REALLY TERRIBLE.

1:09:19.467 --> 1:09:21.700
TERRIBLE.

1:09:21.700 --> 1:09:23.800
IT'S A LOT OF EMOTIONS.

1:09:23.800 --> 1:09:25.934
Julie: EARLIER TODAY, I SAW

1:09:25.934 --> 1:09:28.633
YOU AND CYNTHIA TRYING TO GET
TODRICK TO VOTE TO SAVE YOU.

1:09:28.633 --> 1:09:29.300
TODRICK TO VOTE TO SAVE YOU. YES.

1:09:30.233 --> 1:09:31.233
YES.
Julie: YOU COULDN'T CONVINCE

1:09:31.233 --> 1:09:32.200
Julie: YOU COULDN'T CONVINCE HIM.

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:32.433
HIM.

1:09:32.433 --> 1:09:33.500
NO.

1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:35.333
Julie: WHY NOT AND HOW DOES

1:09:35.333 --> 1:09:36.266
IT FEEL YOU COULDN'T CONVINCE

1:09:36.266 --> 1:09:37.233
HIM?

1:09:37.233 --> 1:09:38.500
YOU KNOW, WE HAD A LITTLE

1:09:38.500 --> 1:09:40.867
DEAL IN THE VERY, VERY BEGINNING

1:09:40.867 --> 1:09:41.967
OF THE SHOW SAYING, LISTEN, I

1:09:41.967 --> 1:09:42.700
THINK WE SHOULD LOOK OUT FOR

1:09:42.700 --> 1:09:45.533
EACH OTHER.

1:09:45.533 --> 1:09:47.467
HIS BOND WITH MIESHA IS JUST SO

1:09:47.467 --> 1:09:49.500
STRONG THAT THERE WAS NO
CHANGING HIS MIND,

1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:49.934
CHANGING HIS MIND, UNFORTUNATELY.

1:09:49.934 --> 1:09:51.233
UNFORTUNATELY.

1:09:51.233 --> 1:09:53.000
Julie: CAN WE TAKE A LITTLE

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:53.233
TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE IN THE

1:09:53.233 --> 1:09:54.200
HOUSE?

1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:55.667
I WOULD LOVE IT.

1:09:55.667 --> 1:09:56.033
YEAH, LET'S DO.

1:09:56.033 --> 1:09:57.800
Julie: OK.

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.000
MONDAY NIGHT.

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.166
THE EVICTION NIGHT.

1:10:00.166 --> 1:10:01.967
THAT WAS TERRIBLE.

1:10:01.967 --> 1:10:02.333
THAT WAS THE WORST NIGHT.

1:10:02.333 --> 1:10:04.133
Julie: OK.

1:10:04.133 --> 1:10:07.500
I WANT TO HEAR - WHY DO YOU SAY

1:10:07.500 --> 1:10:08.667
IT WAS THE WORST NIGHT?

1:10:08.667 --> 1:10:10.900
JUST BECAUSE SHANNA HAD TO

1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:12.433
LEAVE BECAUSE WE FELT SO
BETRAYED SHE WAS PLAYING BOTH

1:10:12.433 --> 1:10:12.633
BETRAYED SHE WAS PLAYING BOTH SIDES.

1:10:12.633 --> 1:10:14.700
SIDES.
Julie: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT.

1:10:14.700 --> 1:10:14.967
Julie: LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT. YEAH.

1:10:14.967 --> 1:10:18.300
YEAH.

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:20.400
Julie: ON YOUR HOH WATCH, YOU

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:20.934
FINALLY HAD A CHANCE TO GET RID

1:10:20.934 --> 1:10:22.767
OF MIESHA.

1:10:22.767 --> 1:10:23.433
I KNOW.

1:10:23.433 --> 1:10:24.433
Julie: YOU KNEW HAD BEEN
GUNNING FOR YOU.

1:10:24.433 --> 1:10:24.800
GUNNING FOR YOU. ABSOLUTELY.

1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:26.734
ABSOLUTELY.

1:10:26.734 --> 1:10:27.100
Julie: FROM THE GET-GO.

1:10:27.100 --> 1:10:29.767
ABSOLUTELY.

1:10:29.767 --> 1:10:33.300
Julie: AND ULTIMATELY YOU

1:10:33.300 --> 1:10:34.300
CHOSE TO BELIEVE TODRICK AND
MIESHA'S WORDS.

1:10:34.300 --> 1:10:34.600
MIESHA'S WORDS. RIGHT.

1:10:34.600 --> 1:10:36.967
RIGHT.

1:10:36.967 --> 1:10:39.000
Julie: AND GO WITH THEM OVER

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:39.333
SHANNA MOAKLER'S ACTIONS.

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:41.367
MMH-MMH.
Julie: SHE SAVED YOU FROM THE

1:10:41.367 --> 1:10:42.567
Julie: SHE SAVED YOU FROM THE BLOCK.

1:10:42.567 --> 1:10:44.567
BLOCK.

1:10:44.567 --> 1:10:45.700
MMH-MMH.

1:10:45.700 --> 1:10:48.734
Julie: WHY DID YOU BELIEVE

1:10:48.734 --> 1:10:50.367
WORDS OVER ACTION?
WE REALLY YOU KNOW TRUSTED

1:10:50.367 --> 1:10:50.600
WE REALLY YOU KNOW TRUSTED MIESHA.

1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:52.200
MIESHA.

1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:54.133
I THINK SHE HAS ALWAYS PLAYED
WITH GAME WITH SO MUCH

1:10:54.133 --> 1:10:54.400
WITH GAME WITH SO MUCH INTEGRITY.

1:10:54.400 --> 1:10:56.367
INTEGRITY.

1:10:56.367 --> 1:10:58.200
THAT WHEN THEY PULLED US ASIDE

1:10:58.200 --> 1:10:59.633
AND JUST SAID LISTEN, THIS IS A

1:10:59.633 --> 1:11:01.900
PERSON PLAYING BOTH SIDES THIS

1:11:01.900 --> 1:11:04.367
ENTIRE TIME, AND STAYING UNDER

1:11:04.367 --> 1:11:06.367
THE RADAR, WE JUST THOUGHT, THAT

1:11:06.367 --> 1:11:08.233
WAS THE WAY TO GO TO DEAL WITH

1:11:08.233 --> 1:11:09.467
THE DEVIL YOU KNOW VERSUS

1:11:09.467 --> 1:11:10.533
SOMEBODY THAT WE THOUGHT WE

1:11:10.533 --> 1:11:11.533
COULDN'T TRUST.

1:11:11.533 --> 1:11:14.633
Julie: DID YOU EVER CONSIDER,

1:11:14.633 --> 1:11:15.433
YOU KNOW WHAT, I'LL DEAL WITH

1:11:15.433 --> 1:11:16.300
SHANNA LATER.

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:17.734
WE SHOULD HAVE.

1:11:17.734 --> 1:11:18.467
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SMARTER

1:11:18.467 --> 1:11:19.967
WAY TO GO.

1:11:19.967 --> 1:11:22.867
Julie: YOU DO REGRET NOT

1:11:22.867 --> 1:11:23.133
GETTING RID OF MIESHA?

1:11:23.133 --> 1:11:24.133
YEAH.

1:11:24.133 --> 1:11:25.400
Julie: WHEN DID YOU PUT IT

1:11:25.400 --> 1:11:26.667
ALL TOGETHER IN YOUR HEAD AND

1:11:26.667 --> 1:11:28.600
HAVE THAT REGRET?

1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:29.600
PROBABLY TODAY.

1:11:29.600 --> 1:11:31.800
Julie: WHEN YOU KNEW YOU

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:34.467
COULDN'T FLIP TODRICK?

1:11:34.467 --> 1:11:36.333
I THINK EVEN BEFORE THAT.

1:11:36.333 --> 1:11:37.967
I THINK TODD AND LAMAR STARTED

1:11:37.967 --> 1:11:39.300
SAYING, GOSH, NOW WE HAVE TO GET

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:40.734
RID OF MIESHA.

1:11:40.734 --> 1:11:42.900
THEN, DING, DIPPING, DING.

1:11:42.900 --> 1:11:44.400
WE SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN RID OF
MIESHA WHEN WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN

1:11:44.400 --> 1:11:44.633
MIESHA WHEN WE COULD HAVE GOTTEN MIESHA.

1:11:44.633 --> 1:11:48.734
MIESHA.

1:11:48.734 --> 1:11:49.767
THEY WERE IN SUCH AN ALLIANCE WE

1:11:49.767 --> 1:11:52.000
WITH HER.

1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:52.266
Julie: DID YOU GET BIG

1:11:52.266 --> 1:11:54.734
BROTHERED?

1:11:54.734 --> 1:11:55.133
BY MIESHA AND TODRICK?

1:11:55.133 --> 1:11:55.567
Julie: YEAH.

1:11:55.567 --> 1:11:56.400
I DON'T KNOW.

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:58.000
I HOPE NOT.

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.734
I THOUGHT THEIR STORY SEEMED TO

1:11:59.734 --> 1:12:00.166
ADD UP.

1:12:00.166 --> 1:12:01.967
Julie: OK.

1:12:01.967 --> 1:12:03.834
IF YOU GO HOME AND WATCH

1:12:03.834 --> 1:12:04.500
EVERYTHING AWFUL LIKE YOU GOT

1:12:04.500 --> 1:12:06.066
BIG BROTHERED, WOULD YOU SAY

1:12:06.066 --> 1:12:07.734
THAT'S THE GAME OR ARE YOU GOING

1:12:07.734 --> 1:12:09.100
TO BE MAD?

1:12:09.100 --> 1:12:09.800
I'M GOING TO BE A LITTLE OF

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:10.834
BOTH PROBABLY.

1:12:10.834 --> 1:12:11.333
Julie: WELL, YOU DID PLAY

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:12.800
VERY HARD.

1:12:12.800 --> 1:12:14.166
THANK YOU.

1:12:14.166 --> 1:12:15.734
Julie: YOUR SOCIAL GAME IS

1:12:15.734 --> 1:12:16.100
THE BEST.

1:12:16.100 --> 1:12:17.633
THANK YOU.

1:12:17.633 --> 1:12:18.433
Julie: AND YOU WON A VETO

1:12:18.433 --> 1:12:19.600
WHEN IT WAS CRUCIAL.

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:21.133
I DID.

1:12:21.133 --> 1:12:22.800
Julie: YOU SAVED YOURSELF AND
HOH WHEN IT WAS CRUCIAL TO HAVE

1:12:22.800 --> 1:12:23.000
HOH WHEN IT WAS CRUCIAL TO HAVE POWER.

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.066
POWER.

1:12:24.066 --> 1:12:25.166
I DID.

1:12:25.166 --> 1:12:26.834
Julie: DID YOU SURPRISE

1:12:26.834 --> 1:12:29.533
YOURSELF HOW WELL YOU DID AT

1:12:29.533 --> 1:12:30.066
THIS GAME UP UNTIL NOW?

1:12:30.066 --> 1:12:33.233
I DID.

1:12:33.233 --> 1:12:34.233
I WAS SO IMPRESSED BY MIESHA'S

1:12:34.233 --> 1:12:35.400
PREPARATION THAT SHE KNEW SO

1:12:35.400 --> 1:12:36.767
MUCH ABOUT THE GAME.

1:12:36.767 --> 1:12:37.633
WAS LIKE TRAINING FOR A FIGHT.

1:12:37.633 --> 1:12:38.834
WORKING OUT.

1:12:38.834 --> 1:12:41.600
EATING HEALTHY.

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:42.734
CONSTANTLY WEARING LEGGINS.

1:12:42.734 --> 1:12:44.200
I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO BE

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:45.667
ABLE TO HOLD UP TO THAT.

1:12:45.667 --> 1:12:48.500
I LEARNED A LITTLE BIT MORE AND
MORE ABOUT THE COMPETITION EVERY

1:12:48.500 --> 1:12:48.734
MORE ABOUT THE COMPETITION EVERY WEEK.

1:12:48.734 --> 1:12:51.367
WEEK.

1:12:51.367 --> 1:12:53.667
AND I'M STILL NOT AN EXPERT, BUT

1:12:53.667 --> 1:12:54.700
MAYBE THERE WILL BE AN ALL-STARS

1:12:54.700 --> 1:12:55.834
AND I CAN COME BACK.

1:12:55.834 --> 1:12:57.000
Julie: YOU ARE WELCOME.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:58.100
IN MY OPINION, YOU ARE WELCOME

1:12:58.100 --> 1:13:00.166
ANY TIME.

1:13:00.166 --> 1:13:02.300
YOUR DIARY ROOM SESSIONS.
YOU ARE AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOUSE

1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:02.500
YOU ARE AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOUSE GUEST.

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:04.367
GUEST.

1:13:04.367 --> 1:13:05.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1:13:05.200 --> 1:13:07.667
Julie: GO AHEAD.

1:13:07.667 --> 1:13:08.066
IS THERE A PRIZE FOR THAT?

1:13:08.066 --> 1:13:08.834
Julie: SORRY.

1:13:08.834 --> 1:13:09.500
OH, OH.

1:13:09.500 --> 1:13:10.767
Julie: YOU NEVER KNOW.

1:13:10.767 --> 1:13:11.834
HOW ABOUT WE LISTEN TO YOUR

1:13:11.834 --> 1:13:13.567
GOOD-BYE MESSAGES.
OH, YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE

1:13:13.567 --> 1:13:14.867
OH, YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THOSE.

1:13:14.867 --> 1:13:16.767
THOSE.

1:13:16.767 --> 1:13:19.233
CARSON, I HAD A GREAT TIME

1:13:19.233 --> 1:13:20.200
GETTING TO KNOW YOU.

1:13:20.200 --> 1:13:21.967
YOU TAUGHT ME A LOT.

1:13:21.967 --> 1:13:23.834
I CAN'T WAIT TO HANG OUT IN PALM

1:13:23.834 --> 1:13:24.967
SPRINGS WITH YOU.

1:13:24.967 --> 1:13:25.533
CARSON, YOU ARE QUITE AN

1:13:25.533 --> 1:13:27.000
AMAZING MAN.

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:28.734
I AM SAD TO SEE YOU LEAVE.

1:13:28.734 --> 1:13:30.367
WE WILL MISS YOUR BAKING AND

1:13:30.367 --> 1:13:31.567
YOUR COOKING.

1:13:31.567 --> 1:13:38.367
BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

1:13:38.367 --> 1:13:39.567
PLAYING A FAIR, NOB TPHO NOBLE .

1:13:39.567 --> 1:13:40.600
CARSON, MY DEAR FRIEND.

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:41.934
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1:13:41.934 --> 1:13:44.734
YOU ARE A CLASS ACT.

1:13:44.734 --> 1:13:46.266
I'M HAPPY WE WERE BOTH HERE TO

1:13:46.266 --> 1:13:48.467
REPRESENT THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY.

1:13:48.467 --> 1:13:51.633
WE DID A GREAT JOB, IF I DO SAY

1:13:51.633 --> 1:13:52.633
SO MYSELF AND CONSIDER THE

1:13:52.633 --> 1:13:54.200
HIGHEST COMPLIMENT WE HAD TO GET

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:56.133
YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

1:13:56.133 --> 1:13:57.100
YOU WERE A HUGE THREAT BUT A

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:58.233
LIGHT IN THE HOUSE.

1:13:58.233 --> 1:14:00.767
YOU WILL BE MISSED.

1:14:00.767 --> 1:14:03.266
LOVE YOU, CARSON.

1:14:03.266 --> 1:14:04.433
OH, GOSH, CARSON, I HATE TO

1:14:04.433 --> 1:14:06.700
SEE YOU LEAVE.

1:14:06.700 --> 1:14:09.033
I HAD SUCH A GOOD TIME WITH YOU.

1:14:09.033 --> 1:14:11.333
YOU MADE MY TIME HERE FUN.
I WILL SEE YOU ON THE ODD,

1:14:11.333 --> 1:14:11.934
I WILL SEE YOU ON THE ODD, BUDDY.

1:14:11.934 --> 1:14:13.300
BUDDY.

1:14:13.300 --> 1:14:15.500
CARSON, CARSON, CARSON, I

1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:16.800
DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO START.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:18.300
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW HOW

1:14:18.300 --> 1:14:20.400
AMAZING YOU ARE.

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:22.333
AND HOW MUCH OF AN IMPACT THAT

1:14:22.333 --> 1:14:25.266
YOU HAVE ON OTHER PEOPLE.

1:14:25.266 --> 1:14:26.066
BUT I AM FOREVER CHANGED.

1:14:26.066 --> 1:14:27.600
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU.

1:14:27.600 --> 1:14:29.667
YOU WILL NEVER GET RID OF ME.

1:14:29.667 --> 1:14:35.000
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE YOUR FACE

1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.100
