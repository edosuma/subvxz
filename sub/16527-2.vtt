11:03.325 --> 11:04.327
TRISH:
Hey, baby.

11:04.327 --> 11:06.131
You find me any new clients?

11:06.131 --> 11:07.366
MURTAUGH:
I'm working on it, Counselor.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.037
Hey, can I call you back?

11:09.037 --> 11:11.241
Sure. I was just
thinking about Martin.

11:11.241 --> 11:14.147
Maybe we should give him another
chance tonight at dinner.

11:14.147 --> 11:15.984
♪ I got to do what I got to do ♪

11:15.984 --> 11:18.121
(automatic gunfire)

11:18.121 --> 11:20.025
♪ I got to do what I got to do ♪

11:20.025 --> 11:22.063
♪ I pray to God, he never came ♪

11:22.063 --> 11:24.067
♪ I'm‐a do me, I'm‐a do me ♪

11:24.067 --> 11:26.171
♪ And that's in my blood,
I'll never change... ♪

11:26.171 --> 11:29.879
Uh, can we put a pin in bringing
him around the kids for now?

11:29.879 --> 11:31.314
I got to jump.

11:31.314 --> 11:33.185
(tires screech)

11:34.354 --> 11:36.191
♪ I got to do what I got to do ♪

11:36.191 --> 11:38.295
♪ I pray to God,
he never came... ♪

11:38.295 --> 11:40.332
Take the shot, Murtaugh!

11:40.332 --> 11:43.038
♪ That's in my blood,
I'll never change... ♪

11:43.038 --> 11:44.875
Take the shot!

11:44.875 --> 11:47.046
♪ That's in my blood,
I'll never change. ♪

11:54.360 --> 11:56.064
Hey, what are you doing?

11:56.064 --> 11:57.968
Why didn't you
take the shot?

11:57.968 --> 11:59.103
Because he's driving

11:59.103 --> 12:00.907
a propane truck.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.143
I didn't want
any collateral damage.

12:04.982 --> 12:07.186
And you want to
be spicy salsa.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.190
Well, how far do you think
he's gonna get

12:09.190 --> 12:11.027
in the middle of Hollywood?

12:17.206 --> 12:18.475
I'd say about
two blocks.

12:22.083 --> 12:24.153
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

12:24.153 --> 12:26.091
MURTAUGH:
Scorsese, what do you think?

12:26.091 --> 12:27.627
Little bougie of a pad
for my taste.

12:27.627 --> 12:29.130
I prefer the Bird Streets

12:29.130 --> 12:30.332
or the views
from up on Mulholland.

12:30.332 --> 12:31.902
You make it up this way much?

12:31.902 --> 12:33.906
Everyone dies, Murtaugh.
Even you.

12:33.906 --> 12:36.244
Let me guess.
Death by gunshot wounds.

12:36.244 --> 12:38.348
Very perceptive, Tango.
Or are you Cash?

12:38.348 --> 12:39.350
I always get you guys confused.

12:39.350 --> 12:42.023
Our vic's name is Ronald Dawson.

12:42.023 --> 12:43.291
Up‐and‐coming light heavyweight.

12:43.291 --> 12:44.962
He was renting this place.

12:44.962 --> 12:47.366
My guess: he played
at being hard and pissed off

12:47.366 --> 12:49.270
some actually hard‐playing
dudes who took him out.

12:49.270 --> 12:50.172
He was the primary target.

12:50.172 --> 12:52.711
Good work, Bailey.
This is my protégé.

12:52.711 --> 12:55.449
Or alternate theory:
he wasn't the target.

12:56.986 --> 12:59.257
All right,
let's see what we got.

12:59.257 --> 13:00.960
Hey, that's my phone.

13:00.960 --> 13:03.131
Look at all the bullet holes
around here.

13:03.131 --> 13:06.371
Well, our vic wasn't exactly
keeping a low profile.

13:06.371 --> 13:08.008
All right?
So why spray the place?

13:08.008 --> 13:09.210
He must not have been
the main target.

13:09.210 --> 13:11.114
Well, looky here.

13:11.114 --> 13:14.020
Our party girl over there
was taking selfies.

13:14.020 --> 13:15.690
Here she is in the pool,

13:15.690 --> 13:17.661
obviously looking for her top.

13:17.661 --> 13:18.963
Doing blow.

13:18.963 --> 13:21.201
Scorsese, you missed
quite a party.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.973
And there she is
with the host of the party.

13:23.973 --> 13:27.146
Now, check out the cocktail
waitress in the background.

13:29.150 --> 13:30.954
She's running before
the gunshots.

13:30.954 --> 13:32.289
Which means
she saw the shooter.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.160
RIGGS:
Or the shooter saw her.

13:34.160 --> 13:35.663
Maybe she's the target.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.070
What kind of shoes was
the waitress wearing?

13:39.070 --> 13:41.307
RIGGS:
White Keds. Why?

13:41.307 --> 13:42.309
All right.

13:43.713 --> 13:45.683
Let's find our Cinderella.

13:45.683 --> 13:47.319
Wow. You two are like
peaches and cream.

13:47.319 --> 13:49.023
Starsky and Hutch.

13:49.023 --> 13:50.325
Which one's Starsky?

13:50.325 --> 13:52.196
BOTH:
I am.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.337
Hey, Chief, before you
add up that bill,

13:56.337 --> 13:58.108
the damage to the party happened
<i>before</i> we got there.

13:58.108 --> 14:00.179
That's true,
although there may be

14:00.179 --> 14:01.247
some landscaping issues.

14:01.247 --> 14:02.651
And you thrashed a motorcycle.

14:02.651 --> 14:04.153
And the big explosion
in the middle of Hollywood.

14:04.153 --> 14:05.957
Okay, we're gonna
need separate tabs.

14:05.957 --> 14:07.159
Not now. We have company.

14:07.159 --> 14:09.030
This is Special Agent
Bennet Hirsch.

14:09.030 --> 14:11.201
FBI?
ATF.

14:11.201 --> 14:14.307
I'm here because of the gun
used at the party.

14:14.307 --> 14:16.311
Now, it appears that
it was a next‐gen weapon

14:16.311 --> 14:18.181
that can fire
several rounds at once.

14:18.181 --> 14:19.985
But who would make
something like that?

14:19.985 --> 14:21.454
Could be DARPA,
could be one of several

14:21.454 --> 14:23.191
private military contractors.

14:23.191 --> 14:25.062
We have a lead on a waitress
that fled the scene.

14:25.062 --> 14:26.297
She could be a witness.

14:26.297 --> 14:27.734
I haven't assigned you guys
the case yet.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.738
We got the shooter.

14:29.738 --> 14:31.474
Well, I mean,
we barbecued the shooter,

14:31.474 --> 14:32.777
but we were
the first responders.

14:32.777 --> 14:34.514
And you're forgetting
the most important part.

14:34.514 --> 14:36.417
We stopped the noise complaint.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.956
Find the girl.

14:42.029 --> 14:43.365
MURTAUGH: Hey, Doc,
how's it going with Riggs?

14:43.365 --> 14:45.035
Are you making any progress?

14:45.035 --> 14:47.172
I can't discuss a patient
with you, Murtaugh.

14:47.172 --> 14:49.811
Okay, well,
just blink or something

14:49.811 --> 14:52.082
if you think
my life is in danger.

14:54.554 --> 14:56.057
(folder slaps)

14:57.192 --> 14:58.395
Excuse me.

14:58.395 --> 15:00.767
I'm sorry to hunt
you down, Detective,

15:00.767 --> 15:02.403
but you've missed
our last three sessions.

15:02.403 --> 15:04.173
I must have gotten
the dates wrong.

15:04.173 --> 15:05.208
Hmm.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.413
You looking for this?

15:07.413 --> 15:09.751
Absolutely not.

15:09.751 --> 15:11.722
It would be inappropriate
to drink on duty.

15:11.722 --> 15:15.329
But now that I've seen it,
it is my duty to confiscate it.

15:15.329 --> 15:17.199
You can pick this up
at the end of the day.

15:17.199 --> 15:19.136
Thank you, Dr. Cahill.

15:27.119 --> 15:28.522
(footsteps)

15:28.522 --> 15:31.260
CAHILL: Huh. So, the
rumors are true.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.264
The women's bathroom
is much nicer.

15:33.264 --> 15:34.300
(door closes)

15:34.300 --> 15:35.570
I got to think
this is some kind

15:35.570 --> 15:36.805
of violation
of my privacy.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.576
Riggs, our sessions are
a condition

15:38.576 --> 15:40.345
of you being allowed
back in the field.

15:40.345 --> 15:42.349
You want to work?
You want to carry?

15:42.349 --> 15:43.519
You better talk.

15:43.519 --> 15:45.188
Okay, Doc.

15:45.188 --> 15:47.025
Okay.

15:48.796 --> 15:50.265
(sighs)

15:50.265 --> 15:52.871
I was leading a mission
when things went south.

15:52.871 --> 15:56.310
I lost my entire squadron.

15:56.310 --> 15:58.448
When I got back home,
I wasn't the same man.

15:58.448 --> 16:00.887
And my fiancée at the time
was a flight attendant.

16:00.887 --> 16:03.158
She couldn't be
around me anymore.

16:03.158 --> 16:05.262
So she left.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.805
I tried to get her back.
I even...

16:09.805 --> 16:11.508
bought a ticket
on one of her flights.

16:11.508 --> 16:12.811
Mm, let me guess.

16:12.811 --> 16:15.282
Everybody got
food poisoning?

16:19.089 --> 16:21.093
How'd you know?

16:21.093 --> 16:22.362
That's the plot of <i>Airplane!</i>

16:23.398 --> 16:25.101
It's a hell of a film.

16:28.141 --> 16:30.847
All right, Riggs,
I'm done chasing.

16:30.847 --> 16:33.218
We had a nice moment
there, Doc.

16:33.218 --> 16:35.455
What do you want from me?

16:35.455 --> 16:37.426
Something true.
Anything.

16:37.426 --> 16:38.529
What happened
to your eye?

16:38.529 --> 16:41.133
Bar fight.
You win?

16:42.202 --> 16:43.572
That was the point,
I suppose.

16:45.141 --> 16:47.179
Physical pain is better than
emotional any day,

16:47.179 --> 16:49.618
but believe it or not,
talking helps.

16:54.226 --> 16:56.163
What hurts you the most?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.309
SCORSESE:
<i>She's pregnant.</i>

17:02.309 --> 17:03.177
How do you know?

17:03.177 --> 17:05.348
Blood samples
from Cinderella's shoe

17:05.348 --> 17:06.885
show elevated levels of hCG,

17:06.885 --> 17:09.591
which are either associated with
pregnancy or testicular cancer.

17:09.591 --> 17:11.828
I'll go with pregnancy.

17:11.828 --> 17:13.599
That's why you get paid
the big bucks.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.603
Put her somewhere between
nine and 12 weeks.

17:15.603 --> 17:16.470
BAILEY:
All right, fellas,

17:16.470 --> 17:18.474
I may have a lead
on our Cinderella.

17:18.474 --> 17:20.913
See, now, that's the kind
of useful police work

17:20.913 --> 17:22.182
I'm talking about.

17:22.182 --> 17:23.484
Talk to me, Bailey.

17:23.484 --> 17:25.221
The name the catering
company had was fake,

17:25.221 --> 17:26.257
along with the address.

17:26.257 --> 17:27.359
But they did
have a number

17:27.359 --> 17:28.394
for the phone she used.

17:28.394 --> 17:30.498
Okay, so did you do
the ping thing to get...?

17:30.498 --> 17:31.935
Oh, "ping thing."
That's a technical term.

17:31.935 --> 17:33.939
We should dial the modem,
go on GeoCities.

17:33.939 --> 17:36.243
I triangulated the phone's
most common location

17:36.243 --> 17:38.515
by comparing the signal
strength to the time lag.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.385
Bailey... do you have
an address for me,

17:40.385 --> 17:41.622
yes or no?

17:41.622 --> 17:43.559
BAILEY: Cinderella's address,
as requested.

17:43.559 --> 17:45.195
Thank you.

17:54.313 --> 17:56.918
Not exactly ideal digs
for an expecting mother.

17:58.956 --> 18:00.926
LAPD.

18:00.926 --> 18:04.199
I guess we're gonna have to go
all the way back to the station

18:04.199 --> 18:06.337
and get a warrant.

18:06.337 --> 18:08.374
(cat screeches)

18:08.374 --> 18:09.911
Did you hear that?

18:09.911 --> 18:12.416
Sounds like a woman
in distress to me.

18:12.416 --> 18:14.186
Good thing we're here.

18:23.304 --> 18:25.308
Clear.
Clear.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.285
Natasha Belenko.

18:30.285 --> 18:32.255
Could be her real name.

18:32.255 --> 18:33.525
50 milligrams
of newgen.

18:33.525 --> 18:34.627
That's a prenatal
vitamin.

18:34.627 --> 18:37.299
You take it when you're
pregnant and iron‐deficient.

18:37.299 --> 18:38.535
How the hell you know that?

18:38.535 --> 18:40.305
(footsteps)

18:44.246 --> 18:45.683
It's okay.
We're the police.

18:45.683 --> 18:47.185
We just want
to talk to you.

18:52.496 --> 18:54.266
I'm going up!

18:55.368 --> 18:56.772
Okay, you go up!

18:58.040 --> 18:59.343
(car horn blares)

18:59.343 --> 19:01.413
Hey! It's okay, look!

19:01.413 --> 19:03.552
Hey, hey, I'm a cop!
Natasha, it's okay.

19:03.552 --> 19:04.654
I'm a cop.

19:04.654 --> 19:07.259
You don't look
like a policeman.

19:07.259 --> 19:09.263
I didn't say I was
an exemplary one.

19:10.465 --> 19:11.568
(sobs)

19:13.572 --> 19:15.441
It's not a great
option, Natasha.

19:17.245 --> 19:18.582
It's a long way down.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.588
No, no, no, no, no!

19:21.588 --> 19:23.692
No! Riggs, get away
from the ledge!

19:23.692 --> 19:26.363
Hey, look, far be it for me
to tell anyone

19:26.363 --> 19:28.334
that they need
to continue living.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.471
My only request...

19:30.471 --> 19:32.242
you wait another seven months.

19:34.279 --> 19:36.283
What do you know about me?

19:36.283 --> 19:37.753
I know you're taking care
of yourself

19:37.753 --> 19:39.356
because you already
love that child.

19:39.356 --> 19:41.628
Most important thing
in the world to you

19:41.628 --> 19:43.565
is protecting that baby.

19:44.667 --> 19:46.638
Let me help you.

19:46.638 --> 19:49.376
You can't protect us.

19:51.648 --> 19:53.417
Look, I know we just met,

19:53.417 --> 19:55.556
but it's probably
the only thing I <i>can</i> do.

20:04.373 --> 20:06.110
Riggs!

20:06.110 --> 20:08.481
Trust me.

20:08.481 --> 20:10.552
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to you.

20:11.788 --> 20:13.291
Damn it.

20:20.471 --> 20:21.574
(Natasha screams)

20:23.712 --> 20:24.814
No, no, no!

20:26.383 --> 20:28.387
(both groaning, coughing)

20:29.724 --> 20:31.093
You okay?

20:31.093 --> 20:34.132
Yeah, I think so.

20:34.132 --> 20:36.337
(classical music playing)

20:40.879 --> 20:42.482
Hey!

20:42.482 --> 20:43.885
It's okay, I'm a cop.

20:43.885 --> 20:46.423
(groaning)

20:48.427 --> 20:50.632
Uh, the city will take care
of all this.

20:50.632 --> 20:53.437
Just tell 'me
to put it on my tab.

20:53.437 --> 20:54.674
Martin Riggs.

20:57.646 --> 20:58.782
AVERY:
Help me understand this.

20:58.782 --> 21:00.084
He jumped off a
roof with her?

21:00.084 --> 21:02.623
More like a leaping dive
with a twist.

21:02.623 --> 21:04.761
But I'm not
the most reliable witness.

21:04.761 --> 21:06.831
My eyes were closed.
This man is truly dangerous.

21:06.831 --> 21:09.069
I can't allow him
to be in the field.

21:09.069 --> 21:10.672
Doc, you're gonna have
to back me up on this.

21:10.672 --> 21:11.674
I mean,
psychologically speaking,

21:11.674 --> 21:12.843
he's... he's nuts, right?

21:12.843 --> 21:15.582
He's in a lot of pain.
That's all I can say.

21:15.582 --> 21:18.154
He lost his wife and child
less than a year ago.

21:18.154 --> 21:19.624
Child?

21:21.026 --> 21:22.730
Murtaugh, you didn't know.

21:24.767 --> 21:26.771
She was pregnant.

21:26.771 --> 21:28.642
(quietly):
Oh, my...

21:31.915 --> 21:33.852
RIGGS (over intercom):
So what happened?

21:35.823 --> 21:38.662
I was working at a bar
in San Diego

21:38.662 --> 21:40.666
when I started
dating this man.

21:43.204 --> 21:45.074
I thought it was love.

21:45.074 --> 21:48.047
One day,
I took a picture of him,

21:48.047 --> 21:51.186
and I wanted to send it
to my family.

21:51.186 --> 21:53.959
He got mad.

21:53.959 --> 21:57.633
He took out the SIM card
and microwaved it.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.837
What's this lovely
gentleman's name?

22:01.774 --> 22:03.879
Gino Corelli.

22:03.879 --> 22:05.983
But I don't think it's real.

22:05.983 --> 22:08.020
I was ready
to break it off when...

22:08.020 --> 22:09.790
You got pregnant.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.671
So I followed him
to a motel one day.

22:16.671 --> 22:19.042
I peeked in through the window,

22:19.042 --> 22:23.117
expecting him to be there
with another woman.

22:23.117 --> 22:26.691
But instead,
there were bags with money

22:26.691 --> 22:29.129
and guns in boxes.

22:29.129 --> 22:32.168
Then he saw me.

22:32.168 --> 22:36.109
And like ice, he shot at me.

22:38.715 --> 22:41.988
I was scared,
so I ran to L. A. to hide out.

22:41.988 --> 22:46.263
Then at the party, there was
one of the men from the motel.

22:46.263 --> 22:48.200
<i>He saw me, and then...</i>

22:50.772 --> 22:52.041
<i>(echoing screams)</i>

22:56.718 --> 22:59.256
Hey. It's okay.

22:59.256 --> 23:02.095
(sobs)

23:02.095 --> 23:04.432
Natasha.

23:06.904 --> 23:09.877
I give you my word.

23:09.877 --> 23:11.948
You and you child
are gonna be safe.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.187
RIGGS: <i>I want her in</i>
<i>protective custody.</i>

23:15.187 --> 23:17.025
<i>Safe house. 24‐hour watch.</i>

23:17.025 --> 23:18.127
I'll take the
first shift.

23:18.127 --> 23:19.764
No way. Someone else
will cover it.

23:19.764 --> 23:21.768
Riggs, you're not
being punished.

23:21.768 --> 23:23.103
You done good.

23:23.103 --> 23:25.141
The day's over. Go home.

23:27.713 --> 23:30.217
All right, well,
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

23:30.217 --> 23:32.221
Yeah.

23:38.233 --> 23:39.804
Hey.

23:39.804 --> 23:40.906
Huh?

23:40.906 --> 23:42.308
You want to come
have dinner with us?

23:42.308 --> 23:44.145
No.

23:44.145 --> 23:47.820
No? Not a "No, thank you."

23:47.820 --> 23:49.724
Just flat‐out rejection.

23:49.724 --> 23:52.061
Come on, Rog.
I know what you're trying to do.

23:52.061 --> 23:53.230
All right?
I'm not a charity case.

23:53.230 --> 23:54.934
You know, personally,

23:54.934 --> 23:57.840
I'd like to spend as little
time with you as possible.

23:57.840 --> 23:59.777
But last night when you
didn't show up,

23:59.777 --> 24:01.881
Trish made me eat
a kale salad.

24:01.881 --> 24:04.018
Not even a respectable lettuce.

24:04.018 --> 24:06.289
Man, I worked three days
on those ribs.

24:06.289 --> 24:09.095
You look at 'em, and they just
fall right off the bone.

24:09.095 --> 24:12.268
You want to stay here by
yourself, fine with me.

24:12.268 --> 24:15.241
My ribs are superb.

24:16.711 --> 24:18.180
Rog...

24:18.180 --> 24:20.117
I'm from Texas.

24:20.117 --> 24:22.188
Come on,
don't embarrass yourself.

24:28.333 --> 24:30.304
TRISH: Did your thing
on the ribs‐‐ ah!

24:30.304 --> 24:33.076
No, no, let Martin have it.
He's our guest.

24:33.076 --> 24:34.747
He doesn't want it.
He's still working...

24:34.747 --> 24:36.316
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

24:36.316 --> 24:38.086
I got room for
one more.

24:42.328 --> 24:43.965
Can I be excused?

24:43.965 --> 24:45.067
I have a ton
of homework.

24:45.067 --> 24:46.203
Phone on the table.

24:47.973 --> 24:50.277
And you can leave
once our guest is finished.

24:50.277 --> 24:52.048
I'm done.

24:52.048 --> 24:53.116
Go ahead.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.087
Beer?

24:55.087 --> 24:56.991
Yeah, man, I‐I'd love one.
All right.

24:56.991 --> 24:58.126
Absolutely not.

24:58.126 --> 24:59.864
RIGGS:
Oh, come on, Rog!

24:59.864 --> 25:00.999
What, are you
gonna send the kid

25:00.999 --> 25:02.736
off to college
without a tolerance?

25:02.736 --> 25:05.140
You don't want him waking up
on some frat house lawn,

25:05.140 --> 25:06.309
puking all over himself.

25:06.309 --> 25:07.946
My advice?

25:07.946 --> 25:10.952
Two beers a day and a shot
of whiskey on the weekends.

25:10.952 --> 25:12.756
Doctor's orders.

25:12.756 --> 25:13.992
Okay, one beer.

25:13.992 --> 25:16.764
After you finish
your homework.

25:16.764 --> 25:19.168
Well, I don't want him thinking
it's some kind of big rebellion.

25:19.168 --> 25:20.337
Right?
Right.

25:20.337 --> 25:22.375
Boy, you can <i>smell</i> a beer.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.845
Just a... (sniffs)

25:23.845 --> 25:26.082
That's it.
(laughs)

25:26.082 --> 25:27.786
Some parent you'd make.

25:31.359 --> 25:33.130
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.267
About what?

25:36.336 --> 25:38.340
(baby crying over speaker)

25:40.244 --> 25:41.279
Baby?

25:42.849 --> 25:44.419
Want to help me upstairs?

25:44.419 --> 25:46.289
Yes.

25:50.899 --> 25:53.905
TRISH: <i>Heard a crazy story</i>
<i>down at the courthouse today.</i>

25:55.174 --> 25:57.178
There was a high‐speed
chase in the hills.

25:57.178 --> 26:00.184
Couple of hero cops chased
down a propane truck

26:00.184 --> 26:02.021
that blew a hole
the size of a crater.

26:02.021 --> 26:03.891
It was more
like a pothole,

26:03.891 --> 26:06.229
and I wouldn't call them
"hero" cops.

26:06.229 --> 26:09.870
(chuckles): I mean,
these things get exaggerated.

26:11.139 --> 26:14.012
Okay, I didn't want you
to be worried.

26:14.012 --> 26:17.151
Roger, I've been a cop's wife
for over 20 years.

26:17.151 --> 26:18.420
Worrying, I've learned
to live with.

26:18.420 --> 26:20.424
Lying, I won't.

26:20.424 --> 26:22.028
Okay, I'm sorry.

26:22.028 --> 26:24.298
It's just, my past
three decades as a cop

26:24.298 --> 26:26.403
hasn't been as interesting
and action‐packed

26:26.403 --> 26:28.407
as the three days
with Riggs.

26:28.407 --> 26:31.179
(laughs) I noticed.

26:32.348 --> 26:33.951
He's a good man.

26:33.951 --> 26:36.222
And I can't imagine
what he's been through.

26:36.222 --> 26:38.293
He lost his child.

26:39.429 --> 26:40.431
What?

26:40.431 --> 26:42.168
His wife was pregnant.

that crack house

27:05.347 --> 27:06.951
and you brought
home the stray?

27:06.951 --> 27:10.057
Yeah. Roscoe was a great dog.

27:10.057 --> 27:12.428
(chuckles): Oh, God, Roger.
Roscoe was a nightmare.

27:12.428 --> 27:14.432
I mean, he bit the arm
off the sofa.

27:14.432 --> 27:17.204
Crapped everywhere and attacked
every stranger in sight.

27:17.204 --> 27:18.306
What are you saying?

27:18.306 --> 27:21.312
Is‐is Riggs...
Roscoe in this scenario?

27:21.312 --> 27:24.452
I'm saying...

27:24.452 --> 27:26.924
even though we loved him,
we couldn't have Roscoe today.

27:26.924 --> 27:29.095
Why? Because we have
a bigger house?

27:29.095 --> 27:31.065

this was so formal.

28:32.889 --> 28:34.425
I would have
worn dress socks.

28:34.425 --> 28:35.995
I brought the bagels, so...

28:37.031 --> 28:38.233
You please use a knife?

28:38.233 --> 28:39.435
This is a real meeting.

28:39.435 --> 28:41.472
Sorry.

28:41.472 --> 28:42.609
Continue.

28:42.609 --> 28:45.447
Bullet fragments found at
the scene and in the body

28:45.447 --> 28:47.585
are particularly lethal.

28:47.585 --> 28:48.587
They're designed
to split mid‐air,

28:48.587 --> 28:49.890
giving them a
wider hit radius

28:49.890 --> 28:51.894
and almost 100% accuracy.

28:51.894 --> 28:53.998
That's not a thing
that people do.

28:53.998 --> 28:55.601
It's not gonna‐‐
the hands to flavor, it's weird.

28:55.601 --> 28:56.436
HIRSCH:
You know, the good news

28:56.436 --> 28:58.306
about these bullets,
they can only be

28:58.306 --> 29:00.344
fired out of one gun, the MG10.

29:00.344 --> 29:02.214
It's illegal stateside,
and it's only licensed

29:02.214 --> 29:04.018
for use in
the military overseas.

29:04.018 --> 29:06.422
Well, one of 'em got out.
Who makes this thing?

29:06.422 --> 29:07.592
It's a private
arms contractor,

29:07.592 --> 29:10.030
Stonehill Industrial Group,
down south near San Diego.

29:12.535 --> 29:13.504
Hey, any luck with
the witness?

29:13.504 --> 29:15.875
She's in protective custody,
going through

29:15.875 --> 29:17.579
I. D. books today.
Hey, gentlemen,

29:17.579 --> 29:19.248
just a word to the wise.

29:19.248 --> 29:21.486
Arms contractors don't
take kindly to accusations

29:21.486 --> 29:22.522
of misappropriated weapons.

29:22.522 --> 29:24.860
What he means is,
it's a government facility,

29:24.860 --> 29:25.895
so tread lightly.

29:25.895 --> 29:28.033
I'm taking Riggs
to a gun factory.

29:28.033 --> 29:29.803
What could go wrong?

29:34.980 --> 29:36.416
GARRISON:
<i>I don't understand</i>

29:36.416 --> 29:38.621
what some gangbanger shooting
has to do with this company.

29:38.621 --> 29:41.660
Because we believe that one of
your guns was the murder weapon.

29:41.660 --> 29:42.962
The MG10.

29:44.298 --> 29:45.300
That's impossible.

29:45.300 --> 29:47.471
That weapon's for military use
overseas only.

29:50.477 --> 29:51.980
RIGGS:
Whoo!

29:51.980 --> 29:54.418
You got to let me
try one of them!

29:54.418 --> 29:57.057
Oh, this is a closed range.
Oh, I'm just browsing.

29:57.057 --> 29:58.561
Martin Riggs.

29:58.561 --> 30:00.598
I assume that you have records
of every weapon

30:00.598 --> 30:01.633
you manufacture here.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.537
Yes. We have
detailed manifests

30:03.537 --> 30:05.107
to ensure that
every gun we make,

30:05.107 --> 30:06.610
every gun we ship
is accounted for,

30:06.610 --> 30:08.480
<i>every single one.</i>

30:08.480 --> 30:10.117
Jack Kirstein.

30:10.117 --> 30:11.653
Head of weapons testing.

30:11.653 --> 30:13.557
Ooh, those burns look fresh.

30:13.557 --> 30:16.462
Let me guess. Hot brass
from a sniper rifle?

30:16.462 --> 30:18.366
You been sharpshooting lately?

30:18.366 --> 30:20.705
I was trying to kill a coyote
who was trespassing.

30:20.705 --> 30:23.109
Did you get him?

30:23.109 --> 30:25.380
Slippery bastard got away.

30:25.380 --> 30:26.415
MURTAUGH:
<i>Can I see those?</i>

30:26.415 --> 30:29.455
Sure. Just call the
Pentagon, ask permission.

30:29.455 --> 30:31.125
That big building in Arlington?

30:31.125 --> 30:32.494
(laughs)

30:32.494 --> 30:34.733
Or I could freeze your operation
till I got a warrant.

30:34.733 --> 30:37.505
You know, smelly little
building in downtown L. A.

30:37.505 --> 30:40.177
I could shut you down
for days, maybe even weeks.

30:40.177 --> 30:42.749
(sighs)

30:42.749 --> 30:44.451
You got 20 minutes.

30:44.451 --> 30:47.090
Okay, but don't start the clock
until I start reading.

30:49.461 --> 30:50.263
Okay, go.

30:50.263 --> 30:51.767
RIGGS:
<i>Ooh, what are these?</i>

30:51.767 --> 30:53.571
Test the weapons.

30:53.571 --> 30:56.543
If they're not up to spec,
I tag 'em and they destroy 'em.

30:56.543 --> 30:58.514
How do you know
if they're defective?

30:59.181 --> 31:00.250
(laughs)

31:00.250 --> 31:02.387
Oh, my God,
I'm so sorry. Sorry!

31:02.387 --> 31:03.489
This is for authorized
professionals only!

31:03.489 --> 31:05.728
You need to leave now.
I was not expecting that kick.

31:05.728 --> 31:07.431
That gun is definitely
defective though.

31:07.431 --> 31:09.168
I tell you that right now.

31:09.168 --> 31:10.538
It should be
destroyed immediately.

31:10.538 --> 31:12.140
MURTAUGH:
<i>Hey, man,</i>

31:12.140 --> 31:14.746
while you were playing
with toys, look what I found.

31:14.746 --> 31:18.654
All defective weapons are signed
out to the ATF to be destroyed.

31:18.654 --> 31:22.629
And look who just signed out
a whole cache of those MG‐10s.

31:25.033 --> 31:27.772
Was that Joe... Gonzo?

31:27.772 --> 31:30.176
Gino Corelli‐‐
fake name of our mystery man.

31:30.176 --> 31:33.249
We don't know who he is,
but that's a damn good start.

31:33.249 --> 31:36.657
That is how
Starsky rolls.

31:36.657 --> 31:38.459
Or we could just call him.
Call?

31:38.459 --> 31:40.263
See, because I've got
his number right there.

31:40.263 --> 31:41.800
How... how you...? How'd you...?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.570
You could be Huggy Bear.
That's a good idea.

31:43.570 --> 31:44.506
But, see,
this is Starsky.

31:44.506 --> 31:47.144
Speaking of which,
how's your hood slide?

31:47.144 --> 31:48.814
'Cause mine's
spectacular.

31:48.814 --> 31:52.689
If called upon,
I could do a great hood slide.

31:52.689 --> 31:54.693
Consider yourself
called upon.

31:57.164 --> 32:00.170
You know, just call
the damn number.
Uh‐huh.

32:00.170 --> 32:02.508
(phone ringing)

32:02.508 --> 32:04.779
(phone beeps, ringing stops)

32:04.779 --> 32:05.781
Excuse me, sir.

32:05.781 --> 32:07.785
Here to pick up
the witness.

32:07.785 --> 32:10.190
What?

32:10.190 --> 32:12.060
Riggs, what?

32:13.463 --> 32:15.500
Riggs?
It was Hirsch's
voice on the phone!

32:15.500 --> 32:17.672
Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

32:17.672 --> 32:20.110
(tires screeching,
siren wailing)

32:22.180 --> 32:24.519
Hey, darling.

32:24.519 --> 32:26.556
You miss me?

32:30.831 --> 32:32.835
(siren wailing)
This is on me.

32:32.835 --> 32:33.837
I should've stayed with her!

32:33.837 --> 32:36.142
It's not. It was Avery's call.

32:36.142 --> 32:37.578
Besides, we don't know
anything happened yet.

32:37.578 --> 32:39.248
Do... do you realize
you're in the wrong lane?

32:39.248 --> 32:41.318
(tires screeching)

32:41.318 --> 32:43.724
I gave her my word
that she was gonna be safe.

32:43.724 --> 32:45.861
(phone ringing)
Bailey.

32:45.861 --> 32:47.197
Bailey, I need you to connect us

32:47.197 --> 32:48.734
to the safe house
where Natasha is.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.838
Well, she's gone.
Agent Hirsch picked her up.

32:50.838 --> 32:52.708
Took her to the ATF offices
for photos.

32:52.708 --> 32:53.877
Agent Hirsch

32:53.877 --> 32:55.380
may not know
that his cover is blown.

32:55.380 --> 32:57.618
All government vehicles
are installed with LoJack.

32:57.618 --> 32:59.154
All right, I'm on it.
You want me to put out a BOLO?

32:59.154 --> 33:00.223
Yes!
No!

33:00.223 --> 33:02.160
Track him and call us back.

33:03.530 --> 33:04.666
HIRSCH:
<i>Let's go!</i>

33:05.534 --> 33:06.703
(exhales)

33:06.703 --> 33:08.574
Yo, we got a problem.

33:08.574 --> 33:10.778
Your cops were sniffing
around Stonehill today.
I know.

33:10.778 --> 33:13.316
We got to move these to a
more secure location now.

33:13.316 --> 33:14.619
(muffled thumping)

33:14.619 --> 33:18.326
(sighs) But first,
we got to deal with this.

33:19.829 --> 33:21.900
(muffled screaming)

33:21.900 --> 33:23.737
(crying)

33:33.590 --> 33:35.628
If we call it in now, SWAT's
at least ten minutes away.

33:35.628 --> 33:37.698
Yup.

33:37.698 --> 33:40.403
So we're going into a room
full of trained killers

33:40.403 --> 33:42.942
with guns that have
100% kill rate.

33:42.942 --> 33:44.378
Mm‐hmm.

33:44.378 --> 33:46.650
All right.

33:46.650 --> 33:48.854
Just wanted to make sure
that you were up to speed.

33:50.624 --> 33:51.927
Ready?

33:51.927 --> 33:53.630
(beeping)

33:53.630 --> 33:55.701
I'm ready.
Let's go.

33:58.272 --> 34:00.644
(beeping continues)

34:02.615 --> 34:04.217
(beeping stops)
(whispering): Hey, hey.

34:04.217 --> 34:05.754
Yeah?
I got an idea.

34:05.754 --> 34:07.692
You stay out here
and cover the perimeter.

34:07.692 --> 34:09.361
I'm gonna go inside.
I got this. I got it.

34:09.361 --> 34:11.265
No, no, no.
I got a better idea.

34:11.265 --> 34:14.271
I go inside, <i>you</i> stay
out here with the perimeter.

34:16.643 --> 34:17.945
All right, I'll
see you inside.

34:17.945 --> 34:19.147
I'll see you inside.

34:20.784 --> 34:22.788
(watch beeping)

34:23.824 --> 34:25.126
(whispers):
Shut up!

34:30.838 --> 34:33.409
(computer beeping)

34:39.388 --> 34:40.791
(beeping)

34:51.980 --> 34:54.786
All right, we need to make it
look like I was ambushed

34:54.786 --> 34:56.288
before you kill her.

34:56.288 --> 34:58.259
(muffled):
No! No!

34:58.259 --> 34:59.996
I'm gonna make it look like
I was caught in the crossfire,

34:59.996 --> 35:01.766
so I want you to shoot me
right in this shoulder.

35:02.902 --> 35:04.639
Are you sure you can
make this shot?

35:04.639 --> 35:06.676
I test guns for a living.

35:06.676 --> 35:07.778
There's no one better.

35:07.778 --> 35:09.247
(clears throat)

35:26.448 --> 35:28.486
You okay?
Thank you!

35:28.486 --> 35:29.756
MURTAUGH:
All right, it's over!

35:29.756 --> 35:31.726
Put your weapons down!

35:31.726 --> 35:32.661
Yeah, we're not gonna do that!

35:32.661 --> 35:34.331
We've got more,
and, well, ours are bigger.

35:34.331 --> 35:36.301
Yeah, well, SWAT will be here
any second!

35:36.301 --> 35:38.272
Really?
Because you know what I think?

35:38.272 --> 35:39.976
I think you two morons
came alone.

35:47.357 --> 35:49.729
He's onto us, Rog!

35:49.729 --> 35:50.998
I mean, look,
the moron part,

35:50.998 --> 35:52.768
that was a little harsh,
but, uh...

35:52.768 --> 35:54.939
maybe we should
just surrender.

35:56.375 --> 35:57.845
MURTAUGH:
Hell no!

35:57.845 --> 35:59.916
We going out shooting!

35:59.916 --> 36:02.922
Hey, to be candid, Roger,
you're a terrible shot.

36:02.922 --> 36:06.930
Yeah, I may not be a sniper,
but I hit what's in front of me!

36:14.344 --> 36:18.018
Yeah. Hit what's directly
in front of you, Rog.

36:18.018 --> 36:19.989
And hey...
Huh?

36:19.989 --> 36:23.362
Don't worry about collateral
damage this time.

36:34.317 --> 36:35.554
What, did you miss?!

36:35.554 --> 36:37.023
It's a huge target!

36:37.023 --> 36:37.858
I shot the truck!

36:37.858 --> 36:39.829
You were supposed to hit
the gas tank!

36:39.829 --> 36:43.002
I didn't have an angle
on the gas tank!
Then why didn't you say...

36:43.002 --> 36:45.406
Oh! I can't wait for you two
to shut up!

36:47.778 --> 36:48.914
(fireworks whistling, popping)

37:02.106 --> 37:03.810
(fireworks whistling, popping)

37:09.555 --> 37:11.391
Oh, man.

37:19.407 --> 37:22.514
Please, someone tell me
where Riggs and Murtaugh are.

37:26.088 --> 37:28.526
We could move our session
to the men's room

37:28.526 --> 37:30.129
if that would make you
feel more comfortable.

37:30.129 --> 37:32.968
No. No. It smells
much nicer in here.

37:32.968 --> 37:35.707
Well, after reading the report,

37:35.707 --> 37:37.978
it seems your actions
and Murtaugh's were justified.

37:37.978 --> 37:40.650
Dare I say heroic.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.120
All in a day's work, ma'am.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.024
Suppose that depends
on your job.

37:46.863 --> 37:50.604
Must've felt good to give her
and her child a future.

37:55.981 --> 37:58.753
We could sit here and talk
about crappy B‐movies...

37:58.753 --> 38:00.590
Classics.
... or we could talk about,

38:00.590 --> 38:02.528
what are your plans tonight?
Well, Doc,

38:02.528 --> 38:03.863
I mean, it's a little forward.

38:03.863 --> 38:05.967
I mean...
I mean when you leave here.

38:05.967 --> 38:08.773
When there's
no one else around.

38:08.773 --> 38:10.677
When you go home.

38:10.677 --> 38:12.915
Well, I don't have a home.

38:12.915 --> 38:14.618
Sold it the other day.

38:16.656 --> 38:18.660
You mean back in Texas.

38:18.660 --> 38:21.331
Mm‐hmm.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.572
Riggs, I can't fix you.

38:24.572 --> 38:26.676
(chuckles)

38:26.676 --> 38:28.680
There are no words
in the world

38:28.680 --> 38:31.819
that can make up
for what you lost.

38:31.819 --> 38:35.660
I just want to help
take away some of your pain.

38:43.108 --> 38:46.616
Sorry, Doc.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.185
Pain's all I got.

38:48.185 --> 38:51.024
MURTAUGH:
<i>Was I afraid for my life?</i>

38:51.024 --> 38:54.698
A woman's life was in danger.

38:54.698 --> 38:58.005
What is Roger Mayfield Murtaugh
supposed to do?

38:58.005 --> 38:59.909
Now, some may
call it heroic.

38:59.909 --> 39:01.077
I don't like using

39:01.077 --> 39:02.648
such braggadocious words.

39:02.648 --> 39:06.154
I simply call it...

39:06.154 --> 39:08.158
Tuesday.
(laughter)

39:08.158 --> 39:09.929
TRISH: Can't wait to
hear about Wednesday.

39:09.929 --> 39:11.599
Baby?

39:14.037 --> 39:15.640
What are you doing here?

39:15.640 --> 39:17.644
I came to check on
a client in holding.

39:17.644 --> 39:20.684
<i>Falsely</i> arrested.

39:20.684 --> 39:23.756
But since I'm here,
I'd love to hear more about

39:23.756 --> 39:25.159
the exploits of Mayfield.

39:25.159 --> 39:28.031
Aw, it was nothing,
it was just, um...
Just what?

39:28.031 --> 39:29.969
Just... Tuesday?

39:29.969 --> 39:31.171
Tuesday, yeah.
Uh‐huh.

39:31.171 --> 39:33.008
I'm surprised
you know what day it is,

39:33.008 --> 39:34.745
since you don't
have your watch on.

39:34.745 --> 39:36.114
Oh, must've fallen off.

39:36.114 --> 39:38.185
You know, they're
really flimsy...
Uh‐uh. Roger.

39:38.185 --> 39:40.155
Okay, I took it off.

39:40.155 --> 39:43.896
I was going into a shootout
with a bunch of armed men

39:43.896 --> 39:46.936
with illegal machine guns
with 100% kill rate.

39:46.936 --> 39:48.773
And?

39:48.773 --> 39:51.244
I handled my business.

39:51.244 --> 39:53.215
(laughs)

39:53.215 --> 39:55.954
You damn right you did.

39:55.954 --> 39:57.958
All right.

39:57.958 --> 40:00.764
You don't want to wear
your watch? Fine.

40:00.764 --> 40:04.270
So... we need
to figure out a way

40:04.270 --> 40:06.308
to help that heart rate.

40:06.308 --> 40:08.746
I'm listening.

40:08.746 --> 40:10.015
No more ribs.

40:10.015 --> 40:11.017
No more ribs?

40:11.017 --> 40:13.155
No more ribs?!

40:13.155 --> 40:14.157
(chuckles)

40:14.157 --> 40:15.994
Baby, ribs is all I got left

40:15.994 --> 40:17.864
in this world!

40:17.864 --> 40:19.267
I mean, besides you
and‐and the kids.

40:19.267 --> 40:20.804
(chuckles)

40:22.340 --> 40:23.976
(elevator bell dings)

40:23.976 --> 40:25.179
Hey.

40:25.179 --> 40:26.782
Hey.

40:26.782 --> 40:28.151
What are you doing here?

40:28.151 --> 40:30.824
Freeing an innocent man.
Where you coming from?

40:30.824 --> 40:32.994
Psyche evaluation.

40:34.297 --> 40:36.067
And?

40:39.273 --> 40:41.010
Are you crazy, Riggs?

40:42.380 --> 40:44.250
Seems to be the consensus.

40:46.856 --> 40:48.793
Not to me.

40:54.036 --> 40:55.239
(elevator bell dings)

40:55.239 --> 40:56.909
Have a good night, Trish.

40:56.909 --> 40:58.245
You, too.

40:58.245 --> 40:59.915
(car alarm chirps)

41:01.117 --> 41:02.119
Martin.

41:04.290 --> 41:05.894
No matter what I say to Roger,

41:05.894 --> 41:07.898
he's gonna follow you down
any rabbit hole you go.

41:07.898 --> 41:09.300
And that's okay.

41:09.300 --> 41:13.375
It's what he needs as a cop
and probably as a man.

41:13.375 --> 41:17.349
But I can't imagine what I'd do
if I lost him.

41:17.349 --> 41:20.824
So I need you to
promise me one thing.

41:21.992 --> 41:25.132
At the end of every shift...

41:25.132 --> 41:27.236
make sure he comes home to me.

41:28.940 --> 41:30.810
Yes, ma'am.

41:30.810 --> 41:32.112
I'll do the best I can.

41:32.112 --> 41:34.852
(chuckles)

41:34.852 --> 41:37.356
From what I hear...

41:37.356 --> 41:39.995
that ought to do.

41:39.995 --> 41:42.968
♪ Wonder what they say ♪

41:42.968 --> 41:45.874
(vehicle door closes,
engine starts)

41:45.874 --> 41:49.280
♪ Hey, hey, hey, hey ♪

41:52.386 --> 41:56.962
♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... ♪

41:56.962 --> 41:58.900
You're a lucky man, Rog.

41:58.900 --> 42:01.437
That I am.

42:01.437 --> 42:05.245
Hey. You want to come over,
have some barbecued halibut?

42:07.349 --> 42:09.253
I think I'll pass.

42:10.823 --> 42:12.961
W‐Well, what
about a drink?

42:14.965 --> 42:16.167
Sure.

42:17.236 --> 42:19.006
I know a great place.

42:20.008 --> 42:22.279
Shh!

42:22.279 --> 42:23.883
(whispering):
Okay, wait...

42:23.883 --> 42:26.956
No, I want that there.
I want that there.

42:26.956 --> 42:28.960
Decorating.

42:28.960 --> 42:30.195
Yeah, okay.

42:30.195 --> 42:32.199
Oh.

42:34.403 --> 42:36.942
(mumbling):
Oh, this is mine.

42:36.942 --> 42:38.044
I love these.

42:41.317 --> 42:43.188
A little bright in here, baby?

42:43.188 --> 42:45.292
Oh.

42:45.292 --> 42:46.929
(chuckles)

42:46.929 --> 42:48.398
See, what‐what
had happened...

42:48.398 --> 42:50.335
Shut up. No, no, no.
No?

42:50.335 --> 42:52.306
Oh...

42:52.306 --> 42:53.676
Put the ribs down, Roger.

42:54.477 --> 42:55.947
Put them down.

42:55.947 --> 42:57.416
Mind if I...? I'll just...

42:57.416 --> 42:59.120
I got it. It's okay.

42:59.120 --> 43:00.455
Good night, baby.

43:02.126 --> 43:04.196
Good night, Martin.
Good night, Trish.

43:04.196 --> 43:06.300
Good night, baby.

43:06.300 --> 43:07.671
No, she said no.
