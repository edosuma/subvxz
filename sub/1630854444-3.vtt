WEBVTT

02:23.625 --> 02:25.250
Don't keep me waiting.

02:30.500 --> 02:32.791
Look what you've done.

02:33.416 --> 02:35.916
We should have never gotten on this ship.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.833
It was a mistake.

02:39.958 --> 02:43.833
All of it… a huge mistake.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.416
Ada?

04:28.166 --> 04:29.000
Ada?

06:04.041 --> 06:05.916
Don't tell anyone.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.833
But, Captain,
shouldn't we let the family know?

06:13.333 --> 06:15.958
Someone must have given
the order to reduce speed.

06:38.791 --> 06:40.083
We had a clear view.

06:41.041 --> 06:43.916
And then from one second to the next,

06:45.083 --> 06:46.250
this.

06:48.666 --> 06:50.416
First the compasses, and now the fog.

06:51.416 --> 06:53.000
We can't navigate anymore.

06:55.541 --> 06:56.708
What should we do?

06:58.166 --> 06:59.666
We hold our position.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.958
Wait until the fog has cleared.

07:26.083 --> 07:27.875
This is a mistake.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.291
Just like every other decision
he's made on this trip.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.125
We've gone off course.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.250
He turned the ship back around.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.833
He's completely lost his mind.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.250
Why has the ship stopped?

10:21.333 --> 10:23.500
No one tells us anything.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.750
None of us want to go back.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.375
When they turned the ship around,
they stole our future,

10:30.333 --> 10:33.041
and now they don't even care
if one of us goes missing.

10:35.375 --> 10:38.541
Iben, I'm sure we'll find her.

10:43.875 --> 10:45.125
You didn't find her?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.500
Do something.

10:53.625 --> 10:56.375
It's through prayer
that we find the right path.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.041
Pray with us.

11:03.208 --> 11:06.708
Father! We have to find Ada.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.041
Anker, lead us in prayer.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.291
Don't pretend you don't understand.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.208
Undress.

14:06.458 --> 14:11.083
With all due respect,
you can't leave the ship again.

14:12.708 --> 14:14.666
People want to know what is going on.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.541
Dammit.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.791
I want to know what is going on.

14:22.375 --> 14:24.125
That boy, why won't he speak?

14:26.125 --> 14:27.416
He's right.

14:27.958 --> 14:30.166
There is something wrong with that ship.

14:31.500 --> 14:35.333
We should leave the Prometheus behind
and set the Kerberos back on course.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.583
Lower the boat.

14:48.500 --> 14:49.750
Franz.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.750
He's a drunken wreck.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.416
And you know it.

15:27.166 --> 15:28.625
We must act.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.875
She knows we lied.

18:40.291 --> 18:42.750
She knows that we are not
who we say we are.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.791
Are you happy now?

18:50.416 --> 18:52.166
Is this how you imagined it?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.625
Your freedom?

18:55.875 --> 18:57.333
I tried to protect you.

18:58.041 --> 19:00.875
-I wanted a better life for you.
-A better life?

19:03.083 --> 19:05.000
All you have ever done is put me in a box.

19:05.083 --> 19:08.958
Every time those men
came on board, I had to hide.

19:09.541 --> 19:12.000
You put me in a prison.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.708
You can call it whatever you want.

19:19.166 --> 19:23.125
But at least
you didn't have to sell yourself.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.041
Is that such a big deal?

19:25.125 --> 19:27.791
I've seen you do that often enough.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.208
I know how it is done.

19:31.125 --> 19:33.458
There is no turning back after this.

19:35.666 --> 19:38.833
It's the kind of dirt that never rubs off.

19:40.750 --> 19:45.333
You'll become what I have become, a whore.

19:48.125 --> 19:48.958
Ling Yi!

19:56.750 --> 19:57.791
Ling Yi!

20:08.291 --> 20:10.500
Ling Yi, come back!

20:12.083 --> 20:13.208
Ling Yi!

20:16.833 --> 20:20.041
Please, where are you?

20:30.500 --> 20:31.458
Ling Yi.

20:32.125 --> 20:33.500
You killed her.

20:39.041 --> 20:42.041
I didn't mean to.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.958
How much did you put in her drink?

20:47.875 --> 20:49.708
I just wanted to make her sleep.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.625
It's too late now.

21:01.708 --> 21:02.750
Come give me a hand.

21:05.166 --> 21:06.708
We have to get rid of her.

21:13.375 --> 21:14.375
Ling Yi.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.875
Hurry!

21:29.125 --> 21:30.458
Stop! Stop it!

21:31.875 --> 21:33.083
I'm in here.

21:34.291 --> 21:35.333
Please stop!

21:38.250 --> 21:41.416
Let me out! Let me out!

21:41.500 --> 21:43.291
Let me out!

21:44.708 --> 21:47.583
Help! Help!

21:51.583 --> 21:53.166
Let me out!

21:57.291 --> 21:58.750
Help!

22:09.791 --> 22:11.041
What happened?

22:13.916 --> 22:14.750
It's okay now.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.500
Easy.

22:25.875 --> 22:26.791
Are you cold?

22:35.333 --> 22:38.208
It's dirty, but it's warm.

22:50.416 --> 22:51.708
I'm Olek.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.375
Olek.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.208
Ling Yi.

23:08.458 --> 23:11.000
Ling Yi, I beg you! Where are you?

23:12.750 --> 23:13.750
Ling Yi!

23:14.416 --> 23:15.916
I know a better hiding place.

23:16.791 --> 23:17.625
Come.

23:29.125 --> 23:32.666
Ada is still missing,
and why are we not moving?

23:33.166 --> 23:36.041
Maybe they are thinking
about turning back to America.

23:36.125 --> 23:39.583
Well, we paid for this.
They better bring us to our destination.

23:39.666 --> 23:42.666
We can't go back home. What do they think?

23:42.750 --> 23:44.958
That we have money left
to pay for a second fare?

23:45.541 --> 23:47.875
It's all because of
that other ship out there.

23:47.958 --> 23:49.208
It's cursed.

23:49.291 --> 23:51.833
And that boy they found
brought the curse with him.

23:56.958 --> 24:00.208
Or why else would he,
of all passengers, still be alive?

24:02.250 --> 24:04.375
You, are you part of the crew?

24:04.875 --> 24:06.041
What is happening?

24:08.000 --> 24:09.625
Answer me.

24:22.583 --> 24:23.916
Do you speak German?

24:26.166 --> 24:27.166
A little.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.250
We found your sister.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.416
Who did this?

25:15.166 --> 25:16.500
Who did this?

25:18.583 --> 25:20.000
A doctor examined her.

25:20.875 --> 25:22.916
He couldn't tell exactly what happened.

26:01.458 --> 26:02.625
Get out of my way.

26:05.833 --> 26:06.791
Get out of my way!

26:50.375 --> 26:52.208
Look what the tide brought in.

26:55.583 --> 26:59.041
You must stop acting like this,
or I'll start to think you don't like me.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.583
I'm looking for my sister.

27:08.875 --> 27:10.750
I have no idea what you're saying.

27:10.833 --> 27:12.666
We don't know where she is.

27:18.291 --> 27:20.125
That scar on your face,

27:21.750 --> 27:22.958
how did you get it?

27:34.791 --> 27:36.375
We all wear masks.

27:38.083 --> 27:39.541
We all pretend.

27:40.125 --> 27:42.833
Presenting a perfect illusion
on the outside,

27:43.416 --> 27:47.708
while we desperately try to hide
who we are on the inside.

27:52.541 --> 27:55.291
I was forced to hide
who I am my whole life.

27:56.750 --> 27:57.958
I didn't choose my mask.

27:58.791 --> 28:01.583
My mother chose it for me.

28:01.666 --> 28:02.916
But you…

28:05.833 --> 28:07.166
you can't hide.

28:09.958 --> 28:12.083
Everyone sees you for what you are.

28:22.166 --> 28:23.916
Don't tell me you don't like it.

33:05.750 --> 33:09.083
I know it's not first class, but…

33:27.958 --> 33:31.083
Uh, if you're hungry,
I can get something to eat.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.583
It's not a problem.
I can go and get something.

33:34.666 --> 33:37.833
Wait here. I'll be back in a moment.

34:50.833 --> 34:52.125
Mei Mei?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.250
Are you all right?

35:00.375 --> 35:01.791
Are you human or a ghost?

35:04.208 --> 35:06.000
You must leave now.

35:08.583 --> 35:10.541
My ship isn't leaving until later tonight.

35:10.625 --> 35:12.916
I said goodbye
to the girls at the brothel.

35:13.750 --> 35:16.791
Oh, and I wanted to show you something.

35:28.625 --> 35:29.875
Look how pretty it is.

35:31.833 --> 35:33.791
They told me I'll get more later.

35:37.208 --> 35:41.625
And while I'm waiting
in England for the ship to America,

35:42.208 --> 35:46.416
they will give me dance lessons
and teach me Japanese.

35:51.166 --> 35:55.000
Aren't you happy for me? I finally have
a chance to get out of here.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.500
Why is this happening?
Why is this happening again?

35:57.583 --> 35:58.875
What are you talking about?

36:01.541 --> 36:02.625
Mei Mei?

36:07.458 --> 36:09.000
Did you drink that?

36:11.916 --> 36:15.458
You offered it to me a minute ago.

36:15.541 --> 36:16.416
No.

36:17.458 --> 36:19.208
This can't be happening again.

36:21.708 --> 36:23.541
It was an accident.

36:23.625 --> 36:27.833
I've seen my mother give it
to the men that come here.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.333
They've always woken up again.

36:30.833 --> 36:32.791
I just wanted you to sleep.

36:33.708 --> 36:34.875
So when you woke up,

36:34.958 --> 36:38.333
I would have taken your place
and been on my way to England.

36:42.250 --> 36:44.208
Wake up this time!

36:51.333 --> 36:52.541
What happened?

36:57.791 --> 36:58.791
Come on.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.416
Calm down.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.458
I've done

37:09.500 --> 37:11.250
something horrible.

37:13.375 --> 37:14.625
This kimono

37:15.416 --> 37:17.041
doesn't belong to me.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.458
This is not me.

37:21.833 --> 37:23.750
It's all a lie.

37:36.000 --> 37:41.666
We are not supposed to have dreams.

38:11.541 --> 38:12.791
Where have you been?

38:50.458 --> 38:51.458
Krester.

38:51.541 --> 38:54.291
Krester, stop! Stop!

38:55.625 --> 38:57.250
Stop. Stop.

38:57.333 --> 38:58.583
We have to open the window…

39:01.458 --> 39:03.458
or her soul can't leave.

39:05.166 --> 39:06.166
Stop.

43:20.750 --> 43:24.000
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

43:43.666 --> 43:44.875
You were right.

43:48.625 --> 43:50.666
We're not supposed to have dreams.

43:53.916 --> 43:56.541
And if we take what doesn't belong to us…

43:58.916 --> 44:01.958
our dreams turn into nightmares.

44:06.250 --> 44:08.583
Tell Mrs. Wilson that I'm ready.

45:03.041 --> 45:04.208
Are you going out?

45:06.250 --> 45:07.250
Yeah.

45:07.791 --> 45:09.166
I'm going to get some air.

45:09.791 --> 45:11.041
Want me to come with you?

45:18.291 --> 45:19.291
No.

47:29.208 --> 47:30.083
Stop.

47:32.125 --> 47:34.000
Don't. That's not what I want.

47:36.750 --> 47:38.750
I'd just like to stay here for a while.

47:40.291 --> 47:41.500
If you don't mind.

47:52.291 --> 47:54.875
Things never work out
the way you imagine they will.

47:58.291 --> 48:00.833
This is exactly
what I wanted my whole life.

48:01.666 --> 48:03.125
First class.

48:03.750 --> 48:05.125
Fine clothes.

48:05.708 --> 48:08.208
I thought I deserved a different life.

48:12.250 --> 48:14.666
None of that matters anymore.

48:18.333 --> 48:19.500
Don't be afraid.

48:22.791 --> 48:24.583
It never lasts long.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.250
These aren't the only ones.

49:30.083 --> 49:33.041
We found three more bodies
in the crew quarters.

49:37.333 --> 49:38.916
Just the same as the little girl.

49:41.291 --> 49:42.416
No blood.

49:44.041 --> 49:45.291
No bruises.

49:46.625 --> 49:47.583
Nothing.

49:49.791 --> 49:51.083
You're the first mate.

49:53.041 --> 49:55.041
You must take command of the ship.

49:55.791 --> 49:58.625
You said it yourself.
There's something wrong with that ship.

49:59.125 --> 50:03.791
Something killed everyone over there,
and now the same thing is happening here.

50:04.625 --> 50:07.000
Why did the company want us
to sink the ship?

50:07.875 --> 50:11.666
Maybe they didn't want
whatever is on that ship to get off.

50:16.875 --> 50:18.416
You heard the captain.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.500
We wait.

50:54.500 --> 50:56.166
I know what you're thinking.

50:58.083 --> 50:59.958
I know you feel mistreated.

51:00.041 --> 51:01.791
Treated unfairly.

51:04.541 --> 51:05.833
You're not the only ones.

51:06.958 --> 51:10.000
People are dying like flies on our ship.

51:11.625 --> 51:13.666
And what does the captain do?

51:14.708 --> 51:15.583
Nothing.

51:17.625 --> 51:19.000
I say we fight.

51:19.083 --> 51:20.000
Yes!

51:20.083 --> 51:22.416
And set the Kerberos back on course.

51:26.791 --> 51:27.875
Who's with me?

51:35.250 --> 51:36.875
Good. Hand out the guns.

52:00.916 --> 52:02.708
Hey! You, Olek!

52:08.000 --> 52:10.166
Stop him before he warns the captain!

52:27.500 --> 52:29.458
This is a fucking mutiny!

52:30.041 --> 52:31.541
This is insane!

52:41.000 --> 52:44.333
Looks like this trip hasn't
turned out the way you planned either.

52:58.708 --> 52:59.833
This way.

53:07.041 --> 53:08.041
Ramiro.

53:09.125 --> 53:11.250
You won't believe what is happening.

53:11.333 --> 53:12.916
People are arming themselves.

53:18.166 --> 53:19.250
Where were you?

53:20.750 --> 53:22.000
Did you hear what I said?

53:22.833 --> 53:25.625
There's gonna be a mutiny.
They're overthrowing the captain.

53:27.125 --> 53:28.333
We're going to America.

53:29.583 --> 53:30.875
Were you with him?

53:31.375 --> 53:34.541
Jesus, Ramiro.
You sound like a jealous housewife.

53:35.416 --> 53:37.833
Did you hear what I said?
We get what we want.

53:37.916 --> 53:39.541
They're turning the ship around.

53:41.291 --> 53:43.000
Maybe I don't want that anymore.

53:44.333 --> 53:45.583
Are you on your period?

53:47.625 --> 53:49.583
Do you ever take anything seriously?

53:50.458 --> 53:55.541
You constantly make me feel
like I'm less than you.

53:55.625 --> 53:59.000
That all of this is somehow my fault.

53:59.083 --> 54:00.291
But it isn't.

54:00.875 --> 54:01.708
It's you.

54:01.791 --> 54:05.166
You made me do all of this.

54:05.250 --> 54:07.375
None of this would have ever happened.

54:07.458 --> 54:09.333
You and I would have never happened.

54:11.916 --> 54:14.583
Ángel, for Christ's sake.

54:16.000 --> 54:17.541
I killed a man.

54:18.875 --> 54:21.875
I fucking took someone's life.

54:21.958 --> 54:23.708
And now I'm wearing his clothes.

54:23.791 --> 54:27.000
And all because of you.
Because you can't control yourself!

54:28.291 --> 54:29.541
How can you be like this?

54:35.458 --> 54:36.875
You promised you'd change.

54:42.500 --> 54:44.916
You cannot change the nature of things.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.458
I am who I am.

54:48.166 --> 54:49.375
And you are who you are.

54:50.958 --> 54:52.291
Nothing will change that.

55:03.458 --> 55:04.666
Where are you going?

55:06.250 --> 55:07.791
To do the right thing.

55:08.708 --> 55:10.208
To warn the captain.

57:07.416 --> 57:11.291
They want to turn the ship back around,
to America.

57:11.875 --> 57:13.125
They've got guns.

57:40.166 --> 57:41.625
We're turning the ship around.
