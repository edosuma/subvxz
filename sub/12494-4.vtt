WEBVTT

00:03.583 --> 00:05.417
Okay, so that's the tight end,

00:05.500 --> 00:07.250
and the guy next to him
is called the split end.

00:07.333 --> 00:10.166
Split end?

00:10.250 --> 00:13.250
What do they call him after
he shampoos and conditions?

00:17.917 --> 00:20.959
Yeah, let's not watch football.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.667
Hey, we should talk about prom.

00:23.750 --> 00:26.250
So I was thinking,
if you show up by like six,

00:26.333 --> 00:28.750
then we can do some pictures.
Then if we left by six-thirty--

00:28.834 --> 00:31.125
Teddy! Teddy, hold on.
I haven't even asked you yet.

00:31.208 --> 00:34.291
Well, I just assumed.
I mean, we're boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:34.375 --> 00:36.625
Well, yeah, I know, but I still think
I should ask you, you know.

00:36.709 --> 00:37.959
It's kind of how it's done.

00:38.041 --> 00:40.125
Fine, go ahead, ask me.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.709
Teddy, would you like to go
to the prom with me?

00:43.792 --> 00:44.959
No.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.166
Wait. What?

00:47.250 --> 00:49.542
Well, first you make a whole
big deal out of the invitation,

00:49.625 --> 00:50.625
then you just blurt it out?

00:50.709 --> 00:52.583
Where's the romance, the heart?

00:53.917 --> 00:55.250
Maybe I should start over.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.250
Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be best.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.959
- Teddy, would you like to go to the--
- No, no, no, no.

01:02.041 --> 01:04.083
Go outside. Start over there.

01:06.625 --> 01:08.792
Go on, go on.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.959
If we're gonna do this, do it right.

01:15.709 --> 01:16.792
I'll get it.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.000
Teddy Duncan,

01:24.333 --> 01:26.458
would you do me the honor

01:27.667 --> 01:30.583
of allowing me to escort you to the prom?

01:31.333 --> 01:34.542
Oh, you're tearing up. Oh, my gosh.

01:34.625 --> 01:37.250
Of course I'll go with you, baby.

01:39.250 --> 01:41.667

What are you guys doing?

02:41.333 --> 02:44.250
I'm looking through my yearbook,
trying to find a prom date.

02:44.333 --> 02:46.417
Yeah, and I'm watching him
so I can see what mistakes

02:46.500 --> 02:48.208
to avoid when I'm in high school.

02:49.583 --> 02:51.709
PJ, prom's this Saturday.

02:51.792 --> 02:53.000
You might wanna hurry up.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.166
Oh, it's okay. I've seen his report card.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.375
He'll probably have two more senior proms.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.917
Hey, what do you know
about Cynthia Markowski?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.625
She was in the gifted program
and graduated early.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.750
Stupid smart people.

03:09.291 --> 03:12.041
Hey, what about Robin Rogers?

03:12.125 --> 03:14.041
- She's pretty cute.
- That's a guy.

03:17.583 --> 03:19.041
Who was your date last year?

03:19.125 --> 03:20.458
Uh, I went with a group.

03:20.917 --> 03:24.083
Oh, so now we're calling Emmett a group?

03:26.250 --> 03:28.417
There's gotta be somebody
out there for me.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.500
I just hope I find her in time.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.083
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:42.333 --> 03:43.709
Here's your pizza.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.458
Thanks.

03:46.375 --> 03:49.500
With any luck, PJ may have just
found his prom date.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.000
Can I ask you something?

03:53.083 --> 03:55.291
Sure, anything.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.458
Do you guys have any wacky bread?

04:00.500 --> 04:02.208
Yeah, it's gonna take
a little more than luck.

04:02.291 --> 04:03.458
Get over there.

04:11.208 --> 04:13.542
Well, things look good.
The baby's doing great,

04:13.625 --> 04:15.667
but I'm a little concerned
about the weight gain.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.250
I really haven't gained that much.

04:17.375 --> 04:20.834
No, I mean him.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.542
Just kidding.
We like to have fun here, right, Marcia?

04:25.917 --> 04:28.834
So would you like a DVD
of your ultrasound?

04:28.917 --> 04:30.208
- Yes.
- No.

04:30.709 --> 04:33.291
I thought we agreed we wanted to wait
to find out if it's a boy or a girl.

04:33.375 --> 04:34.709
We want to be surprised.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.875
I don't like surprises. I want to know.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.000
And the person carrying the baby

04:39.083 --> 04:41.709
thinks it's better not to know.

04:42.458 --> 04:44.000
We'd like to be surprised.

04:45.125 --> 04:47.041
Put this in the Duncan file, please.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.125
Thanks. That's okay.

04:49.667 --> 04:51.125
We don't need to know.

04:51.208 --> 04:54.041
As long as our baby boy
is healthy, right, doc?

04:54.125 --> 04:55.250
Mm.

04:55.333 --> 04:58.250
I mean, I mean, the main thing
is that our baby girl

04:58.375 --> 05:00.417
is doing great, right, doc?

05:01.250 --> 05:02.667
Bob, honey, the man's not an idiot.

05:02.750 --> 05:05.709
He has a medical degree. Right, doc?

05:11.583 --> 05:12.834
Thanks.

05:13.166 --> 05:15.166
That was a really fun first date.

05:15.250 --> 05:16.583
Taylor, in my experience,

05:16.667 --> 05:18.667
you can never go wrong with mini golf.

05:19.417 --> 05:21.291
PJ, I know we just met,

05:21.375 --> 05:22.917
but can I ask you something?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.417
Okay, but nothing too hard,
'cause this date's going really well.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.625
My senior prom is this Saturday,

05:28.709 --> 05:31.750
and I was wondering
if you would like to go with me.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.166
- Uh-oh.
- Too hard?

05:34.291 --> 05:35.667
No. No. No, no, no.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.667
It's just my senior prom
is also this Saturday.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.375
I was really excited about it,

05:40.458 --> 05:42.834
and I was gonna ask you.

05:42.917 --> 05:44.166
Oh.

05:44.250 --> 05:47.500
But you asked me first, so yes.

05:47.583 --> 05:50.583
Oh, and just so you know,
I would have said yes.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.166
Yes!

05:52.250 --> 05:54.041
- Then it's a date?
- Absolutely.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.667
Wait, whose prom are we going to?

05:57.542 --> 05:58.917
Mine, I think.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.875
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

06:04.083 --> 06:05.834
And after the baby's born,

06:05.917 --> 06:08.125
Mommy and Daddy will bring it home
from the hospital.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.750
But when do they take it back?

06:11.250 --> 06:13.959
Charlie, they don't take the babies back.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.083
I know. I tried with Gabe.

06:17.500 --> 06:19.542
Teddy, there you are.

06:19.625 --> 06:23.417
Hey, listen, um, I was wondering
if you've picked out a prom dress yet.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.750
No, I really need to go shopping.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.125
Or not.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.709
Mom, I need to buy a dress.

06:29.792 --> 06:31.917
I can't just wear something
from my closet.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.083
Maybe not your closet.

06:36.125 --> 06:37.875
I don't like where this is going.

06:39.417 --> 06:43.750
Let me tell you a story
that seemed tragic at the time,

06:43.834 --> 06:46.333
but is now finally
gonna have a happy ending.

06:46.417 --> 06:48.875
I really don't like where this is going.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.083
The year was 1988,

06:52.166 --> 06:54.417
and a young and beautiful
Amy Blankenhooper

06:54.500 --> 06:57.792
was on her way to the prom
with her third choice Bob Duncan.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.750
But alas, all would not
turn out as Amy had planned.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.250
Knowing this story
would go on for a while,

07:06.875 --> 07:08.458
Teddy sat down.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.959
Bob Diddlebock, Amy's first choice,

07:12.041 --> 07:14.000
took his date out for steak.

07:14.583 --> 07:17.917
Bob Duncan had a coupon
for the shrimp bucket.

07:19.125 --> 07:21.542
Anyway, it was an all-you-can-eat night,

07:21.625 --> 07:23.959
and Amy tried to keep up with Bob,

07:24.041 --> 07:25.875
which was her second mistake.

07:26.333 --> 07:30.166
A mistake that her beautiful prom dress
would pay for dearly.

07:33.750 --> 07:36.291
So what are you saying,
did you puke on your prom dress?

07:36.375 --> 07:38.417
Well, in 1988, we called it "hurling."

07:38.542 --> 07:39.750
Ew...

07:40.750 --> 07:44.250
Now this sad little story
is finally gonna have a happy ending.

07:44.333 --> 07:45.667
Teddy, don't you see?

07:45.750 --> 07:48.083
I saved that prom dress all these years

07:48.250 --> 07:50.250
so that you could wear it to your prom.

07:50.375 --> 07:51.417
I'll go get it.

07:51.500 --> 07:53.417
Mom, you really don't have to--

07:53.500 --> 07:55.792
- Oh!
- Ba-bam!

08:00.083 --> 08:03.000
Teddy, when this dress goes to the prom,

08:03.125 --> 08:06.417
it'll almost be like
I finally get to go to the prom.

08:10.959 --> 08:12.500
I wish it were you.

08:14.208 --> 08:15.458
And, Charlie,

08:16.125 --> 08:18.583
maybe you can wear this to your prom, too.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.709
No, thank you, Mommy.

08:26.417 --> 08:29.917
Okay. What ya doing, Dad?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.041
Oh, just thinking about the new baby.

08:33.125 --> 08:35.458
Yeah, I like to do my thinking upstairs,

08:35.542 --> 08:37.792
just in case someone wants
to come down here,

08:37.875 --> 08:39.959
play some video games or something.

08:41.542 --> 08:43.917
You know, all I want to know

08:44.000 --> 08:45.959
is if it's gonna be a boy or a girl.

08:46.041 --> 08:49.083
But your mother wants to be surprised.

08:49.166 --> 08:51.875
Well, why don't you find out
and then not tell Mom?

08:51.959 --> 08:53.458
You have a brain of your own, right?

08:55.917 --> 08:57.500
Of course, I do.

08:58.083 --> 09:00.125
It's just that your mother's brain
doesn't like it

09:00.208 --> 09:02.834
when my brain goes off on its own.

09:05.709 --> 09:08.208
Dad, you can't just do
whatever Mom tells you to do.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.333
You have to stand up for yourself.

09:10.417 --> 09:14.125
You know, you have to call the doctor
and you have to demand to know.

09:14.208 --> 09:16.792
- You know what? You're right.
- Right?

09:16.875 --> 09:18.667
- I mean, I am the baby's father.
- Yes, you are.

09:18.750 --> 09:22.583
Yes, I do have some rights.

09:25.041 --> 09:27.250
Hello. Marcia, Bob Duncan.

09:27.417 --> 09:29.417
I don't wanna...
I don't wanna bother the doctor.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.500
I was just, could you maybe, for me,

09:31.625 --> 09:33.792
could you just take
a little look-see in our file

09:33.875 --> 09:36.250
and just tell me
if we're gonna have a boy or a girl?

09:37.250 --> 09:39.959
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

09:41.083 --> 09:43.125
Okay, sure.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.667
All right, what did she say?

09:44.750 --> 09:47.625
Would I please hold
while she calls your mother?

09:51.792 --> 09:54.250
Well, face it, Dad.

09:54.709 --> 09:57.083
Your brain's no match for Mom's.

09:58.500 --> 10:01.834
But lucky for you, I have a plan.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.375
Is it an evil plan?

10:03.458 --> 10:05.834
No, no, no.

10:05.917 --> 10:07.458
It's a plan that helps the poor.

10:07.542 --> 10:09.417
Of course, it's an evil plan.

10:11.125 --> 10:13.083
I don't know.

10:13.166 --> 10:15.875
Oh, come on. You know you want to do it.

10:15.959 --> 10:18.000
Isn't that why you came to me
in the first place?

10:19.291 --> 10:20.375
Yeah.

10:33.709 --> 10:36.709
- Wow! You look great.
- So do you.

10:37.208 --> 10:38.834
- Well, come on in.
- Okay.

10:42.625 --> 10:43.792
Here we are.

10:44.417 --> 10:46.500
- What is this?
- It's the prom.

10:46.583 --> 10:49.208
Your prom is here in your house?

10:49.291 --> 10:51.834
Yeah, I'm homeschooled.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.750
Huh.

11:00.083 --> 11:02.083
So this is the whole prom?

11:02.709 --> 11:05.375
Just you and me

11:05.458 --> 11:07.291
and some old lady?

11:08.208 --> 11:10.583
Oh! That's my grandma.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.375
She's also the DJ.

11:13.417 --> 11:14.583
Why's she wearing a sombrero?

11:14.667 --> 11:17.834
Oh! Because the theme of the prom

11:17.917 --> 11:19.500
is "South of the Border."

11:20.834 --> 11:22.083
Oh, okay, that makes sense.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.834
For a second there,
I thought it was weird.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.750
Hola, kids!

11:26.834 --> 11:28.917
Let the fiesta begin. Ole!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.542
PJ, this is my mom.

11:31.625 --> 11:32.917
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.542
And my biology teacher
and my history teacher

11:35.625 --> 11:38.041
- and my math teacher.
- All right, picture time.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.625
Now smile. It's for the yearbook.

11:53.041 --> 11:54.709
I know this is a little unusual.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.667
I guess I should have told you
I was homeschooled.

11:58.875 --> 12:00.583
Might have been good information to have.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.542
Um, excuse me.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.375
Well, at least
it's not getting any weirder.

12:21.583 --> 12:23.041
Hi...

12:26.041 --> 12:27.583
So what do you think?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.500
I, uh...

12:30.834 --> 12:32.000
Uh...

12:32.375 --> 12:35.417
No, relax, I've got a different dress
hidden in the bushes.

12:38.542 --> 12:41.166
Well, then why are you wearing that one?

12:42.625 --> 12:46.959
Teddy, you almost look as beautiful
in that dress as I did.

12:49.667 --> 12:50.917
Never mind.

12:52.500 --> 12:54.583
Okay, picture time.

12:55.875 --> 12:57.834
Okay, back it up.
You're crushing the ruffles.

13:00.291 --> 13:01.709
Good one.

13:01.792 --> 13:04.208
Okay, over here. Over here.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.917
Over here. Chin down, Spencer.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.875
Okay, Mom, come on, we have to go.

13:09.959 --> 13:11.875
Okay, have fun. Oh, wait! Wait.

13:11.959 --> 13:14.000
I almost forgot. I have a surprise.

13:14.625 --> 13:15.917
The matching hat!

13:18.709 --> 13:20.208
Oh!

13:20.250 --> 13:24.041
Oh, now my head can be
as lucky as the rest of me.

13:34.041 --> 13:36.500
- Hey, excuse me, are you Dr. Karp?
- Yes.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.500
Hi, I'm, I'm Gabe Duncan.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.000
- Oh!
- Nice to meet you.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.458
And, uh, this is Charlie.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.917
You know, we're here because
she's having a hard time

13:45.000 --> 13:47.083
with the new baby thing.

13:48.041 --> 13:49.375
Hey, Charlie,

13:50.000 --> 13:52.083
here's the man who can
make you happy again.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.417
Talk to him.

13:53.959 --> 13:56.667
Will I have a little sister
or little brother?

13:56.750 --> 13:59.333
Aw, did you hear that?

13:59.417 --> 14:01.333
She said, "A wittle sisto
or wittle brudder."

14:01.417 --> 14:02.917
Who can say no to that?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.333
I could.

14:04.417 --> 14:05.792
What kind of doctor would I be

14:05.875 --> 14:07.500
if I told you without
your parents' permission?

14:07.583 --> 14:10.959
A doctor who's got a little
extra walking around money,

14:11.041 --> 14:12.500
if you know what I'm saying.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.542
It's not gonna happen.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.083
I'll be in the exam room.

14:17.959 --> 14:21.250
Gabe, get the DVD. It's in the file.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.083
Oh, okay.

14:23.166 --> 14:26.000
Hey, uh, hey, Charlie,
if you go find the doctor,

14:26.083 --> 14:28.417
I'll give you some candy, okay?

14:28.500 --> 14:30.875
- Okay.
- Okay, come on.

14:32.667 --> 14:33.792
Find him.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.625
Oh, no!

14:36.709 --> 14:40.083
My "wittle sisto" has run
into the exam room!

14:40.166 --> 14:41.583
She can't go in there.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.375
"Daley, Davis." Oh, "Duncan." Got it.
Dad, come on.

15:01.709 --> 15:04.834
Oh, there you are, you little dickens.

15:05.166 --> 15:07.542
Where's my candy?

15:08.917 --> 15:10.208
Candy.

15:10.291 --> 15:13.375
For running away? Oh, I don't think so.

15:13.458 --> 15:14.834
Come on.

15:21.375 --> 15:24.166
So how do I look?

15:24.250 --> 15:27.917
Amazing. I mean, you look incredible.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.125
What are we waiting for?

15:29.208 --> 15:31.458
Let's get in there
and let people see me. Huh?

15:31.542 --> 15:34.625
Oh, who's texting me?

15:35.625 --> 15:36.667
Oh, it's PJ.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.417
Well, here's my prom night.

15:40.875 --> 15:43.458
Turns out Taylor is homeschooled.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.041
So what was supposed to be
the greatest night of my life

15:48.125 --> 15:49.875
is now the strangest.

15:50.291 --> 15:52.208
But I guess I shouldn't complain.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.625
I was voted prom king.

15:57.709 --> 15:59.250
Poor PJ.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.375
It's his senior prom and he's miserable.

16:01.500 --> 16:03.333
Yeah, that's a shame.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.041
Okay, let's go in.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.333
Dr. Karp, have you seen the Duncan DVD?

16:13.417 --> 16:15.375
- I can't find it.
- Amy Duncan?

16:15.458 --> 16:17.250
No, Angela Duncan.

16:17.333 --> 16:19.208
The one who's having triplets.

16:23.709 --> 16:26.667
Aw, man, I'm never getting my own room.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.125
Hey, look out, everyone.

16:35.208 --> 16:37.083
This prom's officially been crashed!

16:37.166 --> 16:40.875
- Spencer: Yeah, all right!
- Yeah. Uh-huh!

16:40.959 --> 16:42.083
What are you guys doing here?

16:42.166 --> 16:43.333
We, uh, we got your text

16:43.375 --> 16:46.125
and your prom looked so... unique.

16:46.208 --> 16:48.125
- Right.
- That we just had to come.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.583
Yeah, what a relief to be away
from all those noisy people,

16:50.667 --> 16:52.792
laughing and having fun.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.667
This is so much better.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.875
Teddy, you gave up your prom for me?

17:00.959 --> 17:02.959
Oh, please.

17:03.041 --> 17:06.500
Going to prom at regular school
is so last year.

17:07.375 --> 17:08.375
Thank you.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.875
Amy: Hello, PJ, are we in the right place?

17:12.834 --> 17:14.208
What's Mom doing here?

17:14.291 --> 17:16.125
Did you send that text to everybody?

17:16.208 --> 17:17.375
Yeah, it was an accident.

17:17.458 --> 17:20.041
Grandma was getting kinda handsy
during the slow dance.

17:20.375 --> 17:23.375
She can't see me in this dress.
Is there another way out of here?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.959
- There's a door around the back.
- Okay, I'm gonna go change.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.583
- Cover for me.
- Wait! I-- No!

17:31.333 --> 17:32.667
- Hi, everyone.
- Hey, hey!

17:32.750 --> 17:34.667
Mom, dad, what are you guys doing here?

17:34.750 --> 17:36.375
Well, we couldn't go to our prom,

17:36.458 --> 17:37.875
so we thought, why not go to yours?

17:37.959 --> 17:39.500
Aw, you guys are the best.

17:40.166 --> 17:42.166
- Hey, there.
- Hey, Spencer,

17:42.250 --> 17:43.917
what are you doing here? Where's Teddy?

17:44.041 --> 17:45.000
I don't know.

17:45.083 --> 17:47.291
Uh, she'll be back in,
like, three minutes.

17:48.709 --> 17:49.875
Yeah, speaking of three, honey,

17:49.959 --> 17:51.542
- we really need to talk.
- Teddy: I'm back!

17:51.625 --> 17:53.166
I'm back. Hi.

17:56.417 --> 17:58.458
Why is your dress on backwards?

18:00.500 --> 18:03.959
Oh! Oh, no! Okay, all right, the truth...
Mom, the truth is,

18:04.041 --> 18:05.750
the reason why I didn't
wanna wear this dress

18:05.834 --> 18:09.458
is because I... I just don't like it.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.208
What's not to like?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.458
On... on me.

18:14.542 --> 18:19.417
See, the problem with such
a beautiful dress

18:19.500 --> 18:22.500
is that it only works on you.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.875
No one can do justice
to this dress like you, Mom.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.333
Teddy, Teddy, Teddy, Teddy.

18:31.417 --> 18:33.959
Honey, if you are suggesting

18:34.041 --> 18:37.417
that I put that dress and this hat on

18:37.500 --> 18:40.208
because we are at a prom
at this very moment,

18:40.291 --> 18:43.250
well, the answer would
be a resounding okay.

18:44.959 --> 18:46.250
Let's go change.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.375
Okay.

18:59.125 --> 19:00.667
You don't mind being here?

19:00.750 --> 19:04.041
As long as I'm with you,
I don't care where we are.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.375
Aw.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.000
Hey! Take a seat, Grandma.

19:07.083 --> 19:08.583
It's not gonna happen.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.875
I hope I get to see you again,

19:15.959 --> 19:18.834
but I don't know, I'm off to college soon.

19:18.917 --> 19:21.000
- Where you going?
- The rec room.

19:24.917 --> 19:29.250
Um, honey, this probably isn't
what you were expecting

19:29.333 --> 19:32.375
to hear at your prom,
but you remember the ultrasound

19:32.375 --> 19:34.417
- we decided not to look at?
- Yes.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.667
- I looked.
- What? Oh, Bob.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.875
Don't tell me, okay?
I don't want to know what we're having.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.542
Well, can I at least tell you
how many we're having?

19:41.625 --> 19:42.625
What?

19:42.709 --> 19:45.458
Honey, we're having triplets.

19:46.375 --> 19:48.333
Oh, come on, why wouldn't
the doctor tell me?

19:48.417 --> 19:50.041
I don't know, but I saw them.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.458
One, two, three.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.125
You mean...

19:56.208 --> 19:57.792
seven kids.

19:59.959 --> 20:01.125
Wow.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.875
I think I'm gonna hurl.

20:03.959 --> 20:06.125
Oh!

20:08.333 --> 20:11.750
Wow! Look at that.
She hit the exact same spot.

20:12.375 --> 20:16.041
Okay, honey, let's get you to the nurse.

20:25.083 --> 20:28.458
Well, Charlie, they say
you never forget your prom,

20:29.208 --> 20:31.000
but I'm gonna try real hard.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.750
PJ, where you going all dressed up?

20:35.834 --> 20:38.333
Taylor's graduation. Back in, like, 20.

20:41.083 --> 20:44.709
Turns out, good news,
Mom's not really having triplets.

20:44.792 --> 20:47.542
Oh, and I took Mom's prom dress

20:47.625 --> 20:50.291
to the dry cleaners,
where it got destroyed.

20:50.417 --> 20:54.083
Cost me ten bucks extra.
You'll thank me for it later.

20:56.500 --> 20:57.875
What did you just say?

21:01.875 --> 21:03.417
Wish me good luck, Charlie.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.291
Hey, Dr. Karp,

21:12.375 --> 21:15.125
well, my grandmother has a very
important question to ask you.

21:15.208 --> 21:18.458
- Hey, Grandma.
- Well, hello!

21:21.291 --> 21:22.959
You're Grandma Duncan?

21:23.041 --> 21:26.291
Oh, why don't you just call me Gladys?

21:26.875 --> 21:30.542
Anywho, I am dying to know

21:30.625 --> 21:34.000
if my new grandchild is a boy or a girl.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.458
I was wondering the same thing about you.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.333
Dr. Karp...

21:41.375 --> 21:43.792
- Mom?
- Oh, hello, son.

21:46.041 --> 21:47.667
So she really is your--

21:47.750 --> 21:49.458
Yeah, pretty freaky, isn't it?

21:50.166 --> 21:53.375
Well, doctor, out with it.

21:53.917 --> 21:55.625
All right, all right, I'll tell you.

21:57.875 --> 22:01.208
The new baby is going to be a...
