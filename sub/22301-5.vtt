00:22.772 --> 00:26.234
[Ben] <i>It's hard to imagine</i>
<i>how I decided to become a chef at all.</i>

00:28.695 --> 00:30.572
<i>Growing up in New Zealand in 1982,</i>

00:30.655 --> 00:32.532
<i>we don't have chefs on television,</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:35.993
we don't have articles written
in magazines about chefs,

00:36.078 --> 00:39.789
we don't have columns in newspapers
written about food even.

00:41.958 --> 00:45.253
<i>I grew up in this</i>
<i>tiny, little isolated community</i>

00:45.337 --> 00:46.421
with hardly any neighbors.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.298
Well, the nearest neighbor
was a 15-minute drive away.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.761
<i>When you don't have video games,</i>

00:53.845 --> 00:56.848
<i>and you don't have proper television</i>
<i>until you're 10 years old,</i>

00:56.931 --> 01:00.518
<i>you have to find all these other things</i>
<i>to give you joy and to be creative.</i>

01:04.981 --> 01:06.316
<i>When I was 14,</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:09.026
<i>I got a job in a small place</i>
<i>run by a brother and sister,</i>

01:09.111 --> 01:10.612
<i>called the Time Out Cafe.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:13.615
From the little cutout
in the wall of the kitchen,

01:13.698 --> 01:14.699
I could see into the dining room,

01:14.782 --> 01:17.869
<i>and I could see</i>
<i>the customers eat my food.</i>

01:19.621 --> 01:22.957
<i>It was the most incredible feeling.</i>

01:23.040 --> 01:24.167
I was hooked.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.253
[opening theme playing]

02:26.229 --> 02:28.273
[train approaching]

02:33.320 --> 02:36.448
[Tony] <i>I can remember</i>
<i>the first time when I went to Attica.</i>

02:36.531 --> 02:41.744
It was like trying to, sort of, work out
what is so special about the place.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.080
<i>It's not glamorous.</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:47.083
<i>Every once in a while,</i>
<i>you can hear the neighborhood bus</i>

02:47.167 --> 02:49.544
<i>literally, sort of, driving by.</i>

02:49.627 --> 02:52.297
And to eat in a place
that is world-class,

02:52.380 --> 02:55.717
you expect something that's
a little bit more like Hollywood.

03:00.972 --> 03:03.933
Attica is a small restaurant.
It's not an expensive restaurant.

03:04.016 --> 03:06.519
It's in a suburban part of Melbourne,

03:06.603 --> 03:09.272
on, you know,
the wrong side of the world.

03:09.897 --> 03:12.359
[chef 1] There are three pork,
one chicken, two fish, then...

03:12.442 --> 03:13.943
[chef 2] Twenty-seven, pork, one chicken.

03:14.026 --> 03:15.487
[chef 1] Have one chicken ready?
[chef 3] Ready.

03:16.279 --> 03:18.114
[Matt] <i>It's small, it's dark.</i>

03:18.197 --> 03:19.407
You kind of go,
"Wait a second,

03:19.491 --> 03:22.369
this shouldn't be a...
top 50 restaurant in the world."

03:22.452 --> 03:24.329
Five potato.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.414
Four egg, please, Danny.

03:26.498 --> 03:28.207
Can we get some slightly
larger bowls, please, Danny?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.334
[Danny] Yeah.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.795
[Matt] <i>You look at Ben,</i>
<i>he's not your celebrity chef,</i>

03:32.879 --> 03:34.672
<i>your supermodel-dating,</i>

03:34.756 --> 03:37.675
Ferrari-driving,
leather jacket-wearing chef.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.471
<i>Question that's asked,</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:45.683
<i>"Is this small restaurant as good</i>
<i>as the best restaurants in the world?"</i>

03:45.767 --> 03:46.976
<i>And the answer is, for me,</i>

03:47.059 --> 03:48.603
Attica would be
one of 20 restaurants

03:48.686 --> 03:51.398
that I would travel to visit
if I didn't live here.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.900
But you know what? I live here.
It's round the corner.

03:53.983 --> 03:56.193
I'm very proud of what it does.

04:00.948 --> 04:04.827
[Tony] <i>You walk inside the dining room,</i>
<i>everything is focused on the table,</i>

04:04.911 --> 04:06.871
<i>the light shines on the food.</i>

04:06.954 --> 04:08.290
It's pure theater.

04:19.801 --> 04:23.305
<i>The butter arrives,</i>
<i>then the bread arrives,</i>

04:23.388 --> 04:25.181
<i>and then before you know it,</i>

04:25.265 --> 04:29.436
<i>it's like a total seduction of courses</i>
<i>after courses after courses.</i>

04:31.771 --> 04:34.148
<i>Eating there is like</i>
<i>looking at somebody</i>

04:34.231 --> 04:37.610
<i>who has put his soul</i>
<i>into the food.</i>

04:37.694 --> 04:41.489
It plays tricks on your palate
in the nicest possible way.

04:46.911 --> 04:49.789
A chef these days has gotta be
so much more than a cook.

04:50.748 --> 04:55.337
<i>They've gotta use color,</i>
<i>language, images, emotion,</i>

04:55.420 --> 04:58.756
<i>in order to animate</i>
<i>what's on the plate.</i>

05:00.174 --> 05:01.175
And as a writer,

05:01.258 --> 05:04.011
my job is to try and find people
who are saying something different,

05:04.095 --> 05:05.722
who've got something to say.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.767
<i>You look at what</i>
<i>makes Ben's food special,</i>

05:09.851 --> 05:12.729
<i>there's a history, there's a story,</i>

05:12.812 --> 05:14.939
<i>there's a relevance,</i>
<i>there's a sense of place.</i>

05:31.038 --> 05:32.749
[Matt] So, Pete,
this is gonna be our bowl

05:32.832 --> 05:35.502
that we wanna make it look as if it...

05:35.585 --> 05:37.587
was just, kind of, cut from the field.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.048
So, you want that dew
on those leaves here,

05:41.132 --> 05:42.467
but we don't want it in the center

05:42.550 --> 05:45.762
where it can dilute
the cabbage too much, all right?

05:51.183 --> 05:53.060
Okay, so, we put these back in here

05:53.144 --> 05:55.688
like it was never disturbed.

05:57.189 --> 05:59.316
This gets carried out.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.569
We put that straight
on the table, like that.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.279
And then those two bowls come out,

06:03.362 --> 06:06.115
but we'd have to decide
on which we prefer out of those two.

06:11.954 --> 06:15.792
<i>At Attica, we only want to do things</i>
<i>that are true to ourselves.</i>

06:19.253 --> 06:20.254
<i>I had these cabbages</i>

06:20.337 --> 06:23.299
<i>and then I had these</i>
<i>feelings around Bolognese.</i>

06:23.382 --> 06:24.634
It was a family dish growing up.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.386
<i>I wanted to use</i>
<i>that kind of technique</i>

06:27.470 --> 06:29.972
of making a Bolognese
to make something new

06:30.056 --> 06:31.974
that didn't actually relate
to Bolognese in any way,

06:32.058 --> 06:33.851
but still made me
feel kind of good.

06:36.813 --> 06:37.980
<i>You start by making a Bolognese,</i>

06:38.064 --> 06:40.149
<i>and then, that doesn't really work.</i>

06:40.232 --> 06:42.444
<i>It's not refined enough,</i>
<i>it's not delicious enough,</i>

06:42.527 --> 06:44.904
<i>and then Pete says,</i>
<i>"Well, why don't we press the Bolognese</i>

06:44.987 --> 06:47.281
<i>and just use</i>
<i>the juice of the Bolognese?"</i>

06:48.199 --> 06:49.826
<i>And this happens organically.</i>

06:52.995 --> 06:55.414
<i>We're not trying to replicate</i>
<i>our mother's cuisine,</i>

06:55.498 --> 06:58.375
but there's something
that is soulful and is fulfilling.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.629
<i>That's what I'm trying to get at.</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:06.175
<i>I'm trying to take people</i>
<i>back to those times in their life</i>

07:06.258 --> 07:07.384
<i>where people who loved them</i>

07:07.469 --> 07:10.137
cooked for them in a way
which was really meaningful,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.599
and really satisfying for them.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.422
[Ben]
<i>When I first moved to Australia,</i>

07:45.507 --> 07:48.885
<i>everywhere I looked, there was</i>
<i>influences of different countries.</i>

07:50.011 --> 07:53.014
<i>And when I looked at a restaurant</i>
<i>and I saw a risotto on the menu,</i>

07:53.097 --> 07:56.392
<i>it didn't invoke</i>
<i>a sense of Australia in me.</i>

07:57.810 --> 07:59.228
<i>And that's one of the reasons why</i>

07:59.311 --> 08:02.482
<i>we started working with</i>
<i>native ingredients of Australia.</i>

08:04.233 --> 08:05.777
<i>Most people have never heard of</i>

08:05.860 --> 08:08.195
99.9% of these ingredients.

08:08.279 --> 08:11.658
These are just things that are
totally unfamiliar to the general public.

08:24.420 --> 08:29.634
Australia has this hidden paint box
of new flavors to play with.

08:34.889 --> 08:37.099
<i>What's fascinating about</i>
<i>watching chefs like Ben is</i>

08:37.183 --> 08:38.518
<i>there's a hunger, a desire,</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:43.147
<i>to try and find ways of turning them</i>
<i>into a gastronomic culinary experience.</i>

08:57.662 --> 08:59.581
[Ben] <i>When we're working</i>
<i>with the native ingredients,</i>

08:59.664 --> 09:01.123
they're very hard to harness.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.962
<i>There's no information</i>
<i>on the Internet about them,</i>

09:06.045 --> 09:09.131
<i>there's no books that</i>
<i>have recipes using them.</i>

09:13.510 --> 09:15.680
<i>When you're developing a dish</i>
<i>like the kangaroo dish,</i>

09:15.763 --> 09:18.182
<i>you wanna take it and work with it</i>
<i>as many ways as possible.</i>

09:21.143 --> 09:22.144
<i>Over that time,</i>

09:22.228 --> 09:25.481
<i>whether it be three months</i>
<i>or two years,</i>

09:25.565 --> 09:27.859
<i>you're always thinking,</i>
<i>"One day, I'm gonna unlock</i>

09:27.942 --> 09:29.151
<i>the greatness of that ingredient.</i>

09:29.235 --> 09:31.696
I'm gonna find the most delicious

09:31.779 --> 09:33.865
and most natural way
of cooking with it."

09:40.830 --> 09:43.916
<i>This is an important part</i>
<i>of our country's heritage.</i>

09:44.541 --> 09:47.211
<i>Australians should have a sense</i>
<i>of pride in these ingredients,</i>

09:47.294 --> 09:50.464
<i>they should know</i>
<i>what they taste like.</i>

09:51.132 --> 09:52.508
<i>Because the connection</i>
<i>to your roots</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:55.427
<i>is really one of the most</i>
<i>important things of all.</i>

10:17.449 --> 10:18.951
[Ben]
<i>Growing up in New Zealand,</i>

10:19.035 --> 10:21.871
<i>we were given incredible</i>
<i>freedom from our parents.</i>

10:21.954 --> 10:25.207
Their great gift to us
was a sense of self-belief

10:25.291 --> 10:26.458
and their time,

10:26.542 --> 10:29.461
which is the most valuable thing
that you can give a child, is time.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.972
<i>As kids, we had</i>
<i>these amazing adventures.</i>

10:43.225 --> 10:46.771
<i>When I was eight years old</i>
<i>and my sister, Tess, was six,</i>

10:46.854 --> 10:49.565
<i>we tramped two hours</i>
<i>from our house by ourselves,</i>

10:49.649 --> 10:51.567
<i>into the native bush.</i>

10:55.237 --> 10:58.490
<i>We walked to this hut</i>
<i>and we camped there the night.</i>

10:59.701 --> 11:02.954
<i>We understood which plants</i>
<i>that you could eat in the bush.</i>

11:03.663 --> 11:06.498
We picked wild berries,
and we picked blackberries,

11:06.582 --> 11:08.793
and we fished
for eels in the stream.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.380
<i>We did so many amazing things.</i>

11:16.675 --> 11:19.053
<i>While we never felt rich in money,</i>

11:19.136 --> 11:23.725
<i>we were rich in family spirit,</i>
<i>and we were always rich in food.</i>

11:25.768 --> 11:27.436
<i>There was hangis</i>
<i>being held on our farm,</i>

11:27.519 --> 11:30.272
<i>organized by my uncles</i>
<i>and my mom and dad.</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:32.399
<i>When you dig a pit</i>
<i>and build a fire</i>

11:32.483 --> 11:34.986
<i>and put these</i>
<i>ingredients into the earth,</i>

11:35.069 --> 11:37.571
<i>and then 12 hours later,</i>
<i>to dig them up,</i>

11:37.654 --> 11:39.656
<i>and they've been transformed...</i>

11:39.741 --> 11:41.033
<i>That's a really amazing thing</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:44.328
<i>to share with people</i>
<i>that you love and your friends.</i>

11:48.124 --> 11:50.126
<i>On the farm,</i>
<i>you're in never any doubt</i>

11:50.209 --> 11:53.004
<i>where food comes from</i>
<i>and the connection of it.</i>

11:59.260 --> 12:00.344
<i>There's one incident,</i>

12:00.427 --> 12:04.473
<i>where we'd gone to the coast</i>
<i>to harvest shellfish for a family meal.</i>

12:07.018 --> 12:09.854
<i>You walk through</i>
<i>this very old tunnel,</i>

12:09.937 --> 12:12.231
<i>and it opens up</i>
<i>into this cove.</i>

12:15.151 --> 12:18.112
<i>There's no people around to speak of.</i>

12:21.323 --> 12:24.326
<i>Two sets of fathers and sons</i>
<i>had drowned at the spot,</i>

12:24.410 --> 12:26.495
so it's a dangerous place to swim.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.208
<i>I was offshore,</i>
<i>maybe 100 meters.</i>

12:31.292 --> 12:34.586
<i>I'd swum out to a reef</i>
<i>with a lot of mussels on it.</i>

12:36.047 --> 12:38.132
<i>My family was playing on the shore,</i>

12:38.215 --> 12:39.884
<i>and I had my back to the sea.</i>

12:41.552 --> 12:44.096
<i>And a big wave came in</i>
<i>and it knocked me over,</i>

12:44.180 --> 12:47.058
<i>and it dragged me</i>
<i>across the reef.</i>

12:48.434 --> 12:51.353
<i>I came up for air,</i>
<i>and another wave hit me.</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:56.733
<i>And it pushed me down again</i>
<i>and it bashed me.</i>

12:58.402 --> 13:00.612
<i>I came up again</i>
<i>and a third wave had come,</i>

13:00.696 --> 13:02.739
<i>and it held me down.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:06.118
<i>And I was drowning.</i>

13:13.334 --> 13:16.462
<i>I do remember the feeling</i>
<i>of being held down.</i>

13:16.545 --> 13:19.006
I remember how lonely I was.
You know, like--

13:19.090 --> 13:22.134
And how lost I was
and how upset I was

13:22.218 --> 13:24.345
about how this was gonna be the end,
you know?

13:31.143 --> 13:33.729
<i>And my father,</i>
<i>who was always my great hero,</i>

13:34.605 --> 13:37.066
he swam in and saved me.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.404
<i>That's the thing about my dad,</i>
<i>he was always watching us.</i>

13:58.963 --> 14:00.547
[Natalia] Who's that?

14:00.631 --> 14:03.009
-Mommy!
-Mommy!

14:04.426 --> 14:07.930
And... shall we see
if we can find Daddy?

14:08.014 --> 14:09.681
[gasps] Who's that?

14:09.765 --> 14:11.683
-Daddy!
-[Natalia] Daddy!

14:14.228 --> 14:17.523
[Ben] <i>When I was 27 years old,</i>
<i>I was working as a cook.</i>

14:19.358 --> 14:20.860
<i>My wife and I had had a baby,</i>

14:20.943 --> 14:25.156
<i>and my wage was not</i>
<i>enough to support my family.</i>

14:25.239 --> 14:27.116
And so, I needed
to find a head chef's job.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.247
<i>I lived in the same</i>
<i>neighborhood as Attica.</i>

14:33.915 --> 14:35.582
<i>I used to walk past</i>
<i>the front of the restaurant</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:39.170
<i>and think that it had good bones,</i>
<i>but no soul.</i>

14:39.253 --> 14:41.713
<i>I applied for the job</i>
<i>and got it.</i>

14:42.631 --> 14:44.133
[chuckling]
I probably thought it was gonna be

14:44.216 --> 14:46.427
a little bit more glossy
than it was in reality.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.100
<i>I didn't actually...</i>

14:53.184 --> 14:56.353
<i>realize the financial state</i>
<i>of Attica at that point.</i>

14:59.941 --> 15:03.319
<i>We owed $150,000</i>
<i>to our suppliers.</i>

15:05.321 --> 15:08.865
We had to get credit cards
and max them out to pay for things.

15:09.866 --> 15:11.953
<i>And it didn't have any customers.</i>

15:13.162 --> 15:16.457
In the early days, it was pretty intense
'cause he was so focused.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.709
Work started at, like,
maybe at 7:00 in the morning.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.212
<i>And we'd go hardcore all day,</i>

15:21.295 --> 15:24.298
<i>just be ready by 6:00,</i>
<i>and then doors were open,</i>

15:25.382 --> 15:27.218
and no one would show up.

15:30.137 --> 15:32.014
[Ben]
<i>We didn't have enough pots or pans.</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:35.101
<i>We would cook a table of four,</i>
<i>we would use all the pots.</i>

15:35.184 --> 15:36.268
<i>And then they would go into the sink</i>

15:36.352 --> 15:39.563
<i>and we'd have to quickly scrub them</i>
<i>to cook the next round.</i>

15:39.646 --> 15:44.235
After about eight months of putting
my hands raw into the water,

15:44.318 --> 15:46.195
my fingers began
to bleed under the nails.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.282
<i>I remember going to the doctor,</i>

15:50.366 --> 15:53.369
<i>and she said, "You've got to stop</i>
<i>and have three months off."</i>

15:53.452 --> 15:56.455
I said, "Three months?" I said,
"I can't even take three hours off."

15:59.833 --> 16:01.377
[Natalia] <i>I don't know whether he had</i>

16:01.460 --> 16:03.754
a set idea on what he thought
the restaurant should be,

16:03.837 --> 16:04.880
what it needed to be.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.216
It just hadn't been
successful before that.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.884
So, I think he definitely
felt the pressure

16:08.968 --> 16:10.552
of having to make it successful.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.684
[Ben] <i>It just took forever</i>
<i>to build momentum</i>

16:17.768 --> 16:20.521
<i>because we were</i>
<i>a two-year-old restaurant</i>

16:20.604 --> 16:22.398
<i>which everybody hated.</i>

16:22.481 --> 16:25.401
<i>So, we had to turn around that.</i>

16:27.069 --> 16:29.405
<i>I was a young chef,</i>
<i>had a young family,</i>

16:29.488 --> 16:32.783
<i>and we were struggling</i>
<i>to make ends meet.</i>

16:32.866 --> 16:34.660
<i>And if you're a young chef,</i>

16:34.743 --> 16:38.080
<i>and you don't succeed the first time,</i>
<i>it's hard to get a second chance.</i>

17:04.815 --> 17:06.900
[Ben]
<i>Tuesdays are different at Attica.</i>

17:06.983 --> 17:08.735
<i>It's an experimental day.</i>

17:08.819 --> 17:11.697
<i>It was conceived because,</i>
<i>at the beginning,</i>

17:11.780 --> 17:13.032
we didn't have a test kitchen,

17:13.115 --> 17:15.534
and we had to find a way to experiment

17:15.617 --> 17:17.619
so that we could develop
our cuisine faster

17:17.703 --> 17:19.080
and more passionately.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.299
[chef 1] Could someone grab
some tea towels, please?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.176
[chef 2] Yes.

17:32.259 --> 17:35.929
[Ben] <i>The night before, I stay up late</i>
<i>after my children have gone to bed,</i>

17:36.012 --> 17:37.013
and I write the menu

17:37.098 --> 17:39.433
based on anything that comes
into my head that I want to do.

17:39.516 --> 17:43.729
Today, we're gonna start
with the mussels and boab.

17:43.812 --> 17:45.606
[Boyle] <i>Tuesdays are pretty crazy,</i>
<i>to be honest.</i>

17:45.689 --> 17:47.899
Pretty much just due to the fact
that us chefs, besides Ben,

17:47.983 --> 17:49.943
don't really know the menu
until the morning we come in.

17:50.652 --> 17:54.448
I want to make a cream from garlic
that we cook down in oil.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.492
Then we're gonna grate
raw portabella mushroom

17:56.575 --> 17:57.701
over the top of that.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.163
[Tony] <i>As a diner</i>
<i>on experimental Tuesdays,</i>

18:01.247 --> 18:03.582
you are literally in the hands
of the gods, put it that way.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.667
Because you just don't
know what you're getting.

18:05.751 --> 18:09.213
Then we wanna do a dish
of Western Australian marron.

18:09.296 --> 18:12.466
We've killed the marron to order
by brain-spiking it.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.218
Let's get started.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.599
Ben's experimental Tuesdays
have been a smart idea.

18:20.682 --> 18:23.310
It's like, well,
you need to develop stuff up,

18:23.394 --> 18:24.395
and you need guinea pigs.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.438
So, why not pick
your quietest night of the week,

18:26.522 --> 18:28.107
and invite people in
at a cheaper rate

18:28.190 --> 18:32.153
to see things in progress,
to understand dishes?

18:32.236 --> 18:35.531
And you'll see dishes that are...

18:35.614 --> 18:37.658
disastrous and will never
see the light of day,

18:37.741 --> 18:40.911
and you'll also see dishes that
will become a signature on the menu.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.294
[Amin]
<i>What I like about Tuesdays is</i>

18:48.377 --> 18:51.630
that you really see the workings
of a real creative person.

18:51.713 --> 18:54.925
It's probably the closest you get
to how his mind works.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.138
[Ben] Get the vinegar straight
on the mussels, okay?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.931
Or should the saltbush
go on top of the cheese?

19:01.014 --> 19:02.724
[Pete] Yeah.
[Ben] I think it should, eh?

19:07.729 --> 19:08.730
Enough?

19:08.814 --> 19:09.898
-More?
-Yeah.

19:11.233 --> 19:13.902
Just take it off
and put the saltbush on.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.531
I think this is gonna taste nice,
but to be completely honest with you,

19:17.614 --> 19:19.283
I don't really like it
when I get a dish

19:19.366 --> 19:21.285
which I can't see what it is.

19:22.994 --> 19:24.330
<i>If you're being</i>
<i>honest with yourself,</i>

19:24.413 --> 19:27.374
<i>you've never cooked</i>
<i>any of these things before,</i>

19:27.458 --> 19:31.753
and it's difficult to cook them well
for 55 people on the first night.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.091
<i>You're just having to make</i>
<i>split-second decisions</i>

19:36.175 --> 19:37.593
and hoping that
they're the right ones.

19:41.555 --> 19:44.975
I actually don't like
what I just did then.

19:45.058 --> 19:48.395
I liked it before it was
covered with butter.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.108
[Matt] <i>I think what's interesting about</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:56.152
<i>the experimentation</i>
<i>in top restaurants is,</i>

19:56.237 --> 19:57.613
<i>it's always there on the menu.</i>

19:57.696 --> 20:01.074
<i>It just depends</i>
<i>how you do the fine-tuning.</i>

20:01.157 --> 20:03.244
<i>And with a small restaurant like Attica,</i>

20:03.327 --> 20:06.372
you don't have the financial luxury

20:06.455 --> 20:11.377
of 70 people working all the time,
just fine-tuning a sauce.

20:11.460 --> 20:12.878
That doesn't happen.

20:30.145 --> 20:32.523
[Amin] <i>Until about 5:00, 5:30, 6:00,</i>

20:32.606 --> 20:34.525
I'm still thinking,
"What's the dish gonna be like?"

20:34.983 --> 20:36.318
Go for it.

20:37.193 --> 20:38.487
How is it?

20:39.488 --> 20:40.697
[Ben] What do you think?

20:41.573 --> 20:43.825
[Durga] <i>Before he tells us</i>
<i>what he feels, he'll ask us,</i>

20:43.909 --> 20:45.369
<i>"What do you think about the dish?"</i>

20:45.452 --> 20:46.620
<i>And it's nice to know that,</i>

20:46.703 --> 20:48.204
<i>even us, who with the hierarchy</i>
<i>of the kitchen,</i>

20:48.289 --> 20:50.332
we're at the bottom,
he'll still want to know our opinion.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.459
[chef 1] How'd that go?

20:52.543 --> 20:53.585
[chef 2] Tamarillo is a lot nicer.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.463
[Pete] Yeah. I feel like they need
a touch of salt, or something?

20:56.547 --> 20:57.964
Couldn't hurt. Couldn't hurt.

20:58.048 --> 20:59.716
I think it's pretty well balanced
apart from that.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.302
-All right, let's move on.
-All right.

21:03.970 --> 21:05.972
[Ben] Almost needs a spoon, eh?

21:06.056 --> 21:07.683
<i>When I'm tasting things</i>
<i>for the first time,</i>

21:07.766 --> 21:11.186
<i>I'm looking for something</i>
<i>that I have never had before.</i>

21:11.270 --> 21:15.106
Then I'm looking for... simpler things
like the balance of the ingredients.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.235
Maybe the vinegar's too strong.

21:20.571 --> 21:24.283
<i>You'll have a plate in front of you,</i>
<i>and it's not right,</i>

21:24.366 --> 21:26.285
<i>and you're just trying</i>
<i>to grab that thing</i>

21:26.368 --> 21:27.661
<i>that's gonna bring</i>
<i>everything together</i>

21:27.744 --> 21:30.121
<i>that you haven't thought of before.</i>

21:30.205 --> 21:32.248
<i>And I'm thinking</i>
<i>right back to the beginning</i>

21:32.333 --> 21:35.043
of my first earliest memories
of cooking when I was five.

21:39.923 --> 21:42.050
<i>And all of that experience cooking,</i>

21:42.133 --> 21:44.636
<i>through childhood</i>
<i>right up until now, 38 years,</i>

21:44.720 --> 21:47.138
<i>everything that you ate</i>
<i>as a human being</i>

21:47.222 --> 21:50.016
<i>make up your memory palate.</i>

21:57.816 --> 22:01.653
[Ben] <i>Once you have a really good range</i>
<i>of different styles and experiences,</i>

22:01.737 --> 22:03.780
<i>you always have that to draw on,</i>

22:03.864 --> 22:05.949
<i>and just subconsciously</i>
<i>almost knowing</i>

22:06.032 --> 22:08.702
<i>what works and what doesn't work.</i>

22:08.785 --> 22:10.787
There's quite a bit of acid
in the sauce already, eh? So...

22:10.871 --> 22:11.872
Yeah, yeah.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.957
I think it's more like
a little drop on each mussel.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.334
Or maybe it's not even the vinegar,

22:15.417 --> 22:17.586
maybe it's a drop of lemon,
like you suggested.

22:18.128 --> 22:19.170
If it was a little more cooked,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.632
it would be a little more clean tasting,
a touch.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.467
<i>Each week,</i>
<i>each year that goes on,</i>

22:23.550 --> 22:26.261
<i>you're gaining confidence,</i>
<i>and your vision becomes clearer.</i>

22:26.344 --> 22:28.263
And so, over nine years...

22:28.346 --> 22:32.142
that vision has got to the point
where it's quite focused.

22:42.110 --> 22:45.030
[Matt] <i>There's a real interest</i>
<i>in the ways chefs work.</i>

22:45.113 --> 22:46.657
<i>And so often, development is</i>

22:46.740 --> 22:50.285
carried out now in laboratories
by chefs in a closed-off world,

22:50.368 --> 22:51.745
and I think people want to...

22:51.828 --> 22:55.081
get a real sense of how
the creative process works.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.839
<i>To be able to go down</i>
<i>on a Tuesday every month</i>

23:02.923 --> 23:04.299
<i>and see new things</i>

23:04.382 --> 23:06.593
that you may then be able to spot

23:06.677 --> 23:08.845
further on down the track,
it's kind of cool.

23:11.932 --> 23:15.644
[Ben] <i>For me, it's always</i>
<i>about wanting to get better.</i>

23:15.727 --> 23:18.772
<i>There's a feeling of elation</i>
<i>when you create something new.</i>

23:20.065 --> 23:22.609
<i>It's greater than almost</i>
<i>any sensation in your life.</i>

23:52.973 --> 23:54.600
[Ben] So, I've ordered the marron.
[chef] Yeah.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.684
I haven't ordered the chicken thigh

23:55.767 --> 23:58.269
because it was just 1.5 kilos
that I was needing.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.521
-Just go out to Solomon's.
-Yeah.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.232
Green wattle, 'cause I couldn't
remember if we had any or not.

24:02.315 --> 24:03.609
-We do have green wattle.
-Okay.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.110
-Twelve hundred of the wild flowers.
-Yeah.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.070
[Ben] And I've ordered sandpaper figs.
[chef] Cool.

24:10.281 --> 24:12.283
[Matt] <i>I think it's important to know</i>
<i>that Ben didn't spring</i>

24:12.367 --> 24:14.786
<i>fully-formed from the womb</i>
<i>as a super-chef.</i>

24:14.870 --> 24:18.707
When he first started at Attica,
it wasn't particularly auspicious.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.209
And the early
Ben Shewry menus were...

24:21.292 --> 24:24.045
a million miles
from what he does now.

24:30.927 --> 24:33.764
[Ben] <i>When I started at Attica,</i>
<i>I didn't feel, at the point,</i>

24:33.847 --> 24:36.266
<i>that I had a culinary identity.</i>

24:39.185 --> 24:40.604
<i>Before the restaurant opened,</i>

24:40.687 --> 24:44.315
<i>I dreamed up of all the things that</i>
<i>I would like to eat at a restaurant.</i>

24:46.652 --> 24:50.238
<i>Thai dishes, European dishes,</i>
<i>dishes from mentors.</i>

24:52.949 --> 24:54.660
Three pork, away!

24:54.743 --> 24:56.161
[chef] Three?

24:56.703 --> 24:58.539
[Ben] Three pork, one chicken,
is that what we're doing?

24:58.622 --> 24:59.623
[chef] Yes.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.750
[Ben] <i>And we were running around,</i>
<i>trying to cook this food,</i>

25:01.833 --> 25:03.418
<i>had no idea what we were doing.</i>

25:03.501 --> 25:05.170
[Ben] Picking up.
[waiter] Pick up, Chef.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.474
[Ben] <i>Around that first week,</i>

25:18.559 --> 25:21.352
<i>we had a table come in</i>
<i>and have a look at the menu,</i>

25:22.145 --> 25:24.731
and turned to the waiter
after reading it and said,

25:24.815 --> 25:27.568
"Whoever wrote this fucking menu
must be on speed."

25:32.948 --> 25:35.075
<i>And I thought,</i>
<i>"My God, what have I done?</i>

25:35.158 --> 25:38.912
<i>I've created some kind of monster</i>
<i>which everybody's hating."</i>

25:49.505 --> 25:52.092
<i>That week, on a Saturday,</i>
<i>we might have done 18.</i>

25:52.175 --> 25:55.971
<i>On a Tuesday, a table of eight,</i>
<i>then the next night, a table of four.</i>

25:56.054 --> 25:59.265
We sit 55, so...

25:59.349 --> 26:00.892
we were going backwards.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.192
<i>There's a romantic story</i>
<i>that says people are just creative</i>

26:09.275 --> 26:10.652
<i>because that's what they like to do,</i>

26:11.527 --> 26:14.322
<i>and they just go around</i>
<i>all the time creating.</i>

26:16.407 --> 26:19.828
<i>Which is just</i>
<i>kind of ridiculous in a way.</i>

26:19.911 --> 26:23.539
<i>Sometimes people have to create</i>
<i>out of pure necessity.</i>

26:26.209 --> 26:28.879
<i>If I didn't create stuff</i>
<i>that was inspiring to people,</i>

26:28.962 --> 26:31.715
<i>and that people didn't like,</i>
<i>we were going to go broke.</i>

26:59.868 --> 27:01.953
<i>I was in a place of frustration</i>

27:02.037 --> 27:04.956
<i>because nobody cared</i>
<i>about the restaurant</i>

27:05.040 --> 27:07.208
<i>and it didn't have any customers.</i>

27:11.880 --> 27:13.256
<i>It made me sad.</i>

27:13.339 --> 27:16.467
<i>And it made me mad as well.</i>

27:19.595 --> 27:21.056
<i>And I realized at that point,</i>

27:21.139 --> 27:22.598
that that was not the future for me,

27:22.683 --> 27:24.685
cooking Thai food
or cooking European food.

27:26.269 --> 27:30.481
<i>The future for me was trying</i>
<i>to develop my own voice in cooking.</i>

27:31.692 --> 27:34.736
<i>I wanted to create something</i>
<i>that was meaningful to me.</i>

27:48.750 --> 27:50.210
<i>I started looking back on my life</i>

27:50.293 --> 27:52.670
<i>and I remembered that time</i>
<i>that I nearly drowned.</i>

27:52.754 --> 27:54.756
I thought at the time that,
you know,

27:54.840 --> 27:58.719
that people were creating dishes
with seafood elements and stuff,

27:58.802 --> 28:01.179
but none of them
really invoked in me

28:01.262 --> 28:02.973
a strong sense of the sea.

28:04.474 --> 28:07.352
<i>Not many people know the feeling</i>
<i>of nearly drowning, either.</i>

28:09.187 --> 28:12.690
<i>Having saltwater</i>
<i>stuffed down your throat</i>

28:13.691 --> 28:15.443
<i>and up in your nose,</i>

28:16.694 --> 28:20.073
<i>and being held under</i>
<i>by a force far greater than you.</i>

28:25.453 --> 28:28.749
So, I wanted to create a dish
which invoked that sensation

28:28.832 --> 28:30.375
in somebody who was eating it,
you know?

28:30.458 --> 28:32.585
Which is kind of macabre.

28:34.170 --> 28:37.465
<i>I went down to the beach</i>
<i>and there was a boat ramp,</i>

28:37.548 --> 28:39.968
<i>and the sea was really wild,</i>

28:40.051 --> 28:41.511
it was like churning
and carrying on,

28:41.594 --> 28:43.679
it was dark and gray,
and it was raining.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.474
<i>And this little wave</i>
<i>lapped up the boat ramp</i>

28:46.557 --> 28:48.559
<i>and then it dispersed.</i>

28:48.643 --> 28:50.270
<i>And what it left was the tiniest,</i>

28:50.353 --> 28:53.899
<i>tiniest, tiniest bit</i>
<i>of bright green seaweed.</i>

28:53.982 --> 28:56.401
And I was like,
"Oh, my God, look at that!"

28:56.484 --> 28:58.486
And I ran down the boat ramp
and I picked it up.

28:59.821 --> 29:02.323
<i>I started looking around.</i>
<i>"Well, there's one thing that's edible.</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:04.242
<i>And there must be other things,</i>
<i>you know?"</i>

29:04.325 --> 29:05.869
<i>So, I started looking</i>
<i>and I started trying,</i>

29:05.952 --> 29:07.370
<i>and I started tasting,</i>
<i>and all of a sudden,</i>

29:07.453 --> 29:10.540
<i>I'd discovered, like,</i>
<i>six things in this one area.</i>

29:10.623 --> 29:14.044
<i>And they all become ingredients</i>
<i>on this dish Sea Tastes.</i>

29:22.177 --> 29:26.848
<i>It was the first moment</i>
<i>of creating something myself</i>

29:26.932 --> 29:30.977
that wasn't like other things
that other people were creating.

29:31.061 --> 29:35.023
It was the first time I was really
proud of something that I'd cooked...

29:35.106 --> 29:36.566
that wasn't a knockoff.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.082
[Ben] How far is the cabbage, Matty?
[Boyle] It's ready to go.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.583
[Ben] It's ready to go?
[Boyle] Yeah.

29:56.252 --> 29:57.963
[Ben] Obviously, if we're working
over here, Matty,

29:58.046 --> 30:00.173
you need to bring the garnishes
over here in future.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.382
Yes, Chef.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.679
[Ben] <i>As a young cook,</i>

30:06.762 --> 30:09.432
<i>I was the one</i>
<i>in the back of the kitchen</i>

30:09.515 --> 30:10.851
doing all of my mise en place,

30:10.934 --> 30:13.061
and then moving
on to some unrelated project

30:13.144 --> 30:14.770
to try to blow
everybody away with it.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.276
<i>And often, that work</i>
<i>goes unrecognized.</i>

30:21.069 --> 30:23.654
<i>I wasn't satisfied with that.</i>

30:23.738 --> 30:25.198
<i>My ambition was really strong</i>

30:25.281 --> 30:28.701
<i>and it was based around becoming</i>
<i>a new father for the first time.</i>

30:29.870 --> 30:34.290
<i>And I had this little baby,</i>
<i>and my dad had been my great hero.</i>

30:34.374 --> 30:37.710
<i>And I suppose I wanted my son</i>
<i>to feel that way about his dad.</i>

30:40.463 --> 30:42.798
<i>I was super ambitious</i>
<i>for recognition,</i>

30:42.883 --> 30:44.550
<i>ambitious to win awards.</i>

30:46.261 --> 30:47.846
<i>You say to yourself,</i>

30:47.929 --> 30:50.515
<i>"I'm gonna do everything I can</i>
<i>within my power</i>

30:50.598 --> 30:52.683
<i>to make something of myself."</i>

30:55.520 --> 30:59.315
<i>I was like a rabid dog</i>
<i>that just wanted to achieve so much.</i>

31:04.404 --> 31:05.947
<i>This table of four came in,</i>

31:06.031 --> 31:08.408
<i>they asked the waiter</i>
<i>if I could go and see them at the table.</i>

31:08.491 --> 31:10.618
I thought, "Oh, my God,
here I go again.

31:10.701 --> 31:12.787
This time I'm gonna cop it
face-to-face from them."

31:14.830 --> 31:16.499
<i>And they said to me,</i>

31:16.582 --> 31:19.544
"No matter what you do,
don't ever change.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.337
And stay true to yourself."

31:26.092 --> 31:29.012
<i>I thought, "If there's one table</i>
<i>that likes it, there will be others."</i>

31:33.391 --> 31:35.685
<i>We'd won awards.</i>

31:35.768 --> 31:38.146
<i>It made the restaurant busy</i>
<i>for a little while.</i>

31:39.397 --> 31:43.151
<i>And then winter would come,</i>
<i>and the restaurant was dead again.</i>

31:44.777 --> 31:49.782
If you're a very driven person
and you want to achieve a lot,

31:49.865 --> 31:52.827
there's a point where
you can hurt a lot of people.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.832
<i>Running a restaurant becomes your life.</i>

31:57.916 --> 32:01.461
<i>It's not a normal eight-hour shift,</i>

32:01.544 --> 32:04.130
<i>it's a 24-hour-a-day job.</i>

32:05.631 --> 32:10.595
<i>Children need support</i>
<i>and they need to be around their parents.</i>

32:10.678 --> 32:13.764
And I wasn't there
in those early years, you know?

32:13.848 --> 32:16.101
And it's--
And it cuts me to say that.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.445
<i>My father had been a promising pilot.</i>

32:28.238 --> 32:29.990
<i>He gave away many of the things</i>

32:30.073 --> 32:32.700
<i>that he probably wanted</i>
<i>to really do professionally</i>

32:32.783 --> 32:36.496
<i>to create a wonderful environment</i>
<i>for his children.</i>

32:44.795 --> 32:47.173
<i>The way he worked was brutal,</i>
<i>to say the least.</i>

32:48.008 --> 32:51.469
<i>On the side of hills, cutting scrub,</i>
<i>just for hours and hours.</i>

32:51.552 --> 32:54.305
<i>He would cut hundreds of acres of scrub.</i>

32:54.389 --> 32:56.975
I've never seen anybody
work that hard to this day.

32:59.144 --> 33:00.561
<i>And the whole time,</i>

33:00.645 --> 33:03.731
<i>Dad would work like that</i>
<i>with a smile on his face.</i>

33:03.814 --> 33:05.984
<i>My mother, too.</i>
<i>She was working incredibly hard,</i>

33:06.067 --> 33:08.903
<i>so they both were</i>
<i>a really strong team.</i>

33:08.987 --> 33:10.989
They just did the best they could
by their family.

33:11.072 --> 33:12.532
They made the right decisions.

33:15.868 --> 33:17.787
<i>I didn't appreciate my childhood</i>

33:17.870 --> 33:20.081
<i>until I started raising</i>
<i>my own children,</i>

33:20.165 --> 33:22.583
<i>and I realized how hard that is,</i>

33:22.667 --> 33:25.003
<i>and how well my parents had done.</i>

33:33.678 --> 33:35.930
-[Ben] Have some orange juice, kids?
-Okay, thank you.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.349
[Ruby] Is that healthy one?

33:38.433 --> 33:40.393
Everything's healthy, a little bit.
A little bit, okay?

33:40.476 --> 33:41.477
[Ella] Thank you.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.979
[Ben] <i>At around the fourth year,</i>

33:44.064 --> 33:47.733
<i>I was still working too many hours,</i>
<i>and I wasn't seeing my children.</i>

33:47.817 --> 33:49.985
[Ruby] Ella! It tastes different.

33:50.070 --> 33:54.449
It came to a point where
it all compounded on me.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.617
[Natalia] What's Poppy gonna have?

33:56.701 --> 33:59.995
Poppy's gonna have... a pikelet.

34:00.080 --> 34:03.249
-Is he gonna have anything on it?
-No, nothing.

34:06.836 --> 34:10.881
[Ben] <i>When I was at home,</i>
<i>I mean, I was a full-on zombie.</i>

34:13.884 --> 34:16.096
<i>I would be sitting with my kids,</i>

34:16.179 --> 34:19.849
<i>they would be talking to me,</i>
<i>and I wouldn't be hearing them.</i>

34:24.854 --> 34:27.357
<i>I disconnected from my wife.</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:32.570
<i>And I was resenting my work,</i>
<i>which I'd never really felt before.</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:37.367
<i>You realize that there are some</i>
<i>things that are not right in your life.</i>

34:38.576 --> 34:40.911
And you start reflecting on them,

34:40.995 --> 34:42.497
and start wondering,
"Is it worth it?

34:42.580 --> 34:44.832
Is it really worth it, what I'm doing?"
You know?

35:04.227 --> 35:07.605
<i>Around that time,</i>
<i>we began working on this mussel dish,</i>

35:07.688 --> 35:10.775
<i>and a friend of mine</i>
<i>and I had arranged</i>

35:10.858 --> 35:13.486
<i>to go to Portarlington</i>
<i>where the mussel farm is.</i>

35:14.654 --> 35:17.990
<i>We met Lance,</i>
<i>and Lance told me his story.</i>

35:19.867 --> 35:22.870
<i>He told us how</i>
<i>when he was a young man like me,</i>

35:22.953 --> 35:26.249
<i>this entire industry had faced extinction.</i>

35:30.128 --> 35:31.337
<i>He'd worked so much</i>

35:31.421 --> 35:34.215
<i>that he'd missed</i>
<i>a lot of his children's childhood...</i>

35:35.175 --> 35:38.178
<i>and it really struck a chord with me.</i>

35:50.690 --> 35:54.610
<i>It made me realize I was wasting</i>
<i>a significant part of my life</i>

35:54.694 --> 35:56.279
<i>and I had to change.</i>

36:31.981 --> 36:35.067
<i>Four years ago, my son, Kobe,</i>
<i>formed a basketball team</i>

36:35.150 --> 36:38.488
<i>with his friends from kindergarten,</i>
<i>called the Red Dragons.</i>

36:40.448 --> 36:42.700
[Ben] <i>First season, I don't know</i>
<i>if I saw a game at all.</i>

36:42.783 --> 36:43.784
[boy] Take him on!

36:43.868 --> 36:45.870
[Ben] <i>Couldn't get away from work.</i>

36:49.582 --> 36:52.252
<i>I took a night off to go</i>
<i>and watch a game and I was like,</i>

36:52.335 --> 36:55.713
<i>"Wow, Kobe's got natural ability at this."</i>

36:55.796 --> 36:59.174
Other parents went as well,
but they didn't have a coach,

36:59.259 --> 37:01.761
so somebody was just
subbing them on and off.

37:11.771 --> 37:15.024
<i>And then,</i>
<i>I ended up as the coach.</i>

37:15.107 --> 37:17.151
Good passing, boys.

37:18.152 --> 37:20.321
<i>It'd just become</i>
<i>this huge thing in my life.</i>

37:20.405 --> 37:21.406
[Ben] Three.
[boy] Six.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.618
[Ben] Set, go.

37:25.701 --> 37:27.453
<i>After that, it became so important</i>

37:27.537 --> 37:29.789
<i>to be able to feel joy</i>
<i>outside of the restaurant,</i>

37:29.872 --> 37:31.916
<i>outside of cooking.</i>

37:31.999 --> 37:33.876
<i>I'd lost some of that somehow.</i>

38:18.421 --> 38:20.005
[Tony] <i>If there's anything to describe</i>

38:20.089 --> 38:22.425
what Ben is giving
to the rest of the world,

38:22.508 --> 38:24.427
I think he is giving a lot of himself.

38:25.678 --> 38:29.264
<i>There is a part of Ben</i>
<i>that is in all those dishes.</i>

38:31.016 --> 38:35.396
<i>His food is like an emotional response</i>
<i>to moments in his life.</i>

38:45.865 --> 38:49.994
<i>I can remember, there was one dish</i>
<i>which blew my mind.</i>

38:50.077 --> 38:53.038
<i>It was his well and</i>
<i>truly documented dish,</i>

38:53.122 --> 38:56.709
<i>the potato that's cooked</i>
<i>in the earth where it comes from.</i>

38:57.627 --> 38:59.420
And it's just nothing but a potato.

38:59.504 --> 39:04.091
But it's the best, best potato
you have ever, ever eaten in your life!

39:06.260 --> 39:09.221
<i>And you could almost genuflect at somebody</i>

39:09.304 --> 39:14.352
<i>who has made the humble potato</i>
<i>into an edible piece of art.</i>

39:18.230 --> 39:21.108
<i>After that, there was</i>
<i>this underground current</i>

39:21.191 --> 39:23.736
<i>that ran around,</i>
<i>talking about this young man</i>

39:23.819 --> 39:26.113

[Natalia] <i>When he first used to start</i>

<i>I would cut one out</i>
<i>and I would laminate it to keep it.</i>

39:34.955 --> 39:36.707

that we'd get a few

39:36.791 --> 39:38.250

39:38.333 --> 39:39.710
That would be all it would be.
