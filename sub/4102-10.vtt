00:02.207 --> 00:05.806
ABRAHAM: For centuries,
mankind has been the dominant species.

00:06.256 --> 00:10.602
We've domesticated animals,
locked them up, killed them for sport.

00:10.761 --> 00:12.604
But a series of recent events

00:12.763 --> 00:15.357
seem to suggest all
across the globe

00:15.516 --> 00:18.440
animals have decided, "No more."

00:18.602 --> 00:20.229
And so we were hired,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.489
a team of people from
different backgrounds,

00:22.648 --> 00:24.150
with different specialties.

00:24.316 --> 00:26.489
An expert in animal behavior,

00:26.652 --> 00:28.029
a journalist,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.663
safari guide,

00:29.821 --> 00:31.414
foreign intelligence agent,

00:31.573 --> 00:33.792
and a veterinary pathologist.

00:33.951 --> 00:37.421
Our task, to Hnd out what is
happening with the animals,

00:37.579 --> 00:41.800
why it's happening
and how to stop it.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.132
NARRATOR: Previously on Zoo:

00:44.294 --> 00:45.511
[GASPS]

00:46.797 --> 00:48.595
We got it.
This could be the answer.

00:48.757 --> 00:50.100
They found the Mother Cell.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.011
They think they can
use it to make a cure.

00:52.177 --> 00:54.976
That's a shame, if they want to
live to find out if they're right.

00:57.266 --> 01:00.270
I think these lions are
communicating with each other.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.687
Long distance.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.778
FBI! Ben Shaffer was
a friend of mine.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.317
She shot him in self-defense.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.861
He tried to kill us.
Why would he do that?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.825
He was dirty.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.080
[SHOUTS]

01:13.073 --> 01:14.666
Run!

01:28.714 --> 01:31.763
JACKSON: Load them up.
Ray's right behind us with more.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.145
- We gotta go.
- Wait, Jackson, there's more animals.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.185
JACKSON: Gotta go.
Security's closing in on us.

01:43.270 --> 01:45.113
Chloe and I got
what we came for.

01:45.272 --> 01:48.617
- We got trouble! Head to the truck!
- Hey! Hey! Stay right there!

01:48.775 --> 01:49.822
Get down!

01:49.985 --> 01:51.532
Don't move!

01:51.695 --> 01:53.322
Ray, don't!

01:57.993 --> 02:00.542
JACKSON: What about the guy
who made Jamie's fake l.D.?

02:00.704 --> 02:03.082
No. With the authorities looking for
us, we can't risk it.

02:04.082 --> 02:07.427
I mean, if we were not in such a
hurry, we could take a freighter.

02:07.586 --> 02:09.930
I'd give anything for a cruise
to Africa right about now.

02:10.339 --> 02:11.340
Yeah.

02:11.506 --> 02:12.746
- Thanks. WOMAN: You're welcome.

02:12.799 --> 02:15.598
- Electro what?
- Electroporator.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.480
We're gonna need one,
once we find the leopard,

02:18.639 --> 02:21.358
to combine its stem cells
with the Mother Cell.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.144
Wait.
Jackson, we saw one of these.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.734
In Mobile,
in the optometrist's office.

02:26.897 --> 02:29.741
Yeah. Evan Lee Hartley thought
it would help cure him.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.117
Makes sense.

02:31.276 --> 02:34.155
Electroporators are used to
introduce new coding DNA.

02:34.321 --> 02:37.666
So we're probably not gonna
End one in the wilds of Africa.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.918
- No.
- So we'll have to take one with us.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.297
It's not like we can just swing by
a convenience store and pick one up.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.503
It's a highly specialized
piece of equipment.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.293
Where do we End one?

02:47.459 --> 02:48.676
Genetics labs.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.303
Certain hospitals.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.841
So we can add that to our list
of impossible stuff to do.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.554
No one said saving
the world was easy.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.310
MAN: Think there's something.
- Guys.

02:57.469 --> 03:00.063
- Listen to this. WOMAN: No.
Cautious, perhaps.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.691
The CDC is, however,
looking into the matter.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.353
We've heard enough reports
about aberrant animal behavior

03:06.520 --> 03:08.818
that we 're considering
the possibility of a virus.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.323
It's not a virus.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.531
MAN: What can people at home do?
WOMAN: If you notice odd behavior,

03:13.694 --> 03:15.913
see your local veterinarian.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.199
Well, that was helpful.

03:19.116 --> 03:20.789
So I got a question.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.708
If we keep driving south,
straight through Florida,

03:23.870 --> 03:25.838
eventually we're gonna
run out of terra firma.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.795
That's it.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.338
- Florida.
- Florida?

03:29.501 --> 03:30.798
JACKSON: Let's go to Clearwater.

03:32.671 --> 03:33.672
Why?

03:34.339 --> 03:36.019
I mean, never in the
course of human events

03:36.174 --> 03:38.552
has Clean/vater, Florida ever
been the solution to anything.

03:38.719 --> 03:42.098
Well, today it is. In Clearwater,
there is a way to get back to Africa.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.308
What's in Clearwater?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.943
Oh, no. You're thinking about
Ray, aren't you?

03:47.102 --> 03:48.228
Yes, I am.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.523
No. Not that. Not Ray.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.532
Who's Ray?

03:54.317 --> 03:56.490
He's a nightmare.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.525
[GRUNTING]

04:31.688 --> 04:34.237
Come on, Baggo.
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

04:38.028 --> 04:40.747
Can you at least take off
the high school ring, sport?

04:40.906 --> 04:44.456
I know how proud you are that you
have made it as far as high school.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.455
Oh! There they are!

04:48.622 --> 04:50.465
All the way from Africa
to defend my honor!

04:51.625 --> 04:53.593
See you're still as
popular as ever, Ray.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.388
Meet my pals, David and Goliath.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.946
Bet you didn't know
they reconciled

04:58.089 --> 05:00.433
and now they wander the
globe doing the good work.

05:00.592 --> 05:03.186
This gotta stop, Ray.
Gotta stop now.

05:03.345 --> 05:05.018
- Yeah, yeah.
- What did he do?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.308
Released 200 pounds of
caught shrimp from our holds.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.522
And that's the fourth time
this month he's done it.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.061
Tell me something.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.105
You know what bycatch
is, fellas?

05:13.271 --> 05:15.694
Sharks, sea turtles, seals

05:15.857 --> 05:17.530
and other non-target fish

05:17.692 --> 05:19.444
that end up in these
bastards' nets,

05:19.611 --> 05:22.205
only to be tossed overboard
because they ain't shrimp.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.411
It's our living.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.496
And your friend here
is trying to ruin it.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.911
He's not our friend.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.705
This ain't over, Ray.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.626
I'll see you soon.

05:36.461 --> 05:38.839
Gotta say,
I was surprised to hear from you.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.803
Figured you were still
sore about Nairobi.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.476
You almost got us
killed in Nairobi.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.433
Hell,
those poachers were bad men.

05:45.595 --> 05:48.064
And you were on the
right side of right.

05:50.559 --> 05:53.028
Raymond Joseph Endicott.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.654
No past, no future.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.031
My name is Chloe Tousignant.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.318
It is very nice to meet
you, Chloe.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.531
Tell me something.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.492
What are you doing here
with my old friends?

06:02.654 --> 06:04.873
Like I said,
we're not your friends.

06:05.031 --> 06:07.910
You still making that Africa
run, Ray?

06:08.493 --> 06:10.746
- Now and again.
- We need to get out of the country.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.335
The five of us.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.545
Off the books, under the radar.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.220
- How soon do you need to leave?
- As soon as possible.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.177
- That'll cost you.
- How much?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.967
More much than you've got if
you're showing up on my doorstep.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.727
See, here's the thing, Chloe.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.730
I'm what you would call
a, uh, well, a last resort

06:29.222 --> 06:30.895
for Boy Scouts like these two.

06:31.516 --> 06:34.520
So it will cost you "much" much.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.404
Or maybe nothing at all.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.866
What's that mean?

06:40.358 --> 06:43.703
My associates and I are doing a
little something something tonight.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.079
We could use the manpower.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.120
- Is what you do against the law?
- Not if you're a zebra in a cage.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.629
No. No way.

06:52.787 --> 06:53.913
Suit yourself.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.253
And if we do help you?

06:56.625 --> 06:58.252
Then it's simple.

06:58.877 --> 07:01.801
You wash my back and I fly yours
the hell out of the country

07:01.963 --> 07:04.432
one step ahead of whoever
it is that's chasing you.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.020
What is it that you and
your associates are doing?

07:10.305 --> 07:11.727
We're breaking into
Clearwater Zoo.

07:12.349 --> 07:15.102
- To liberate the animals.
- Of course you are.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.428
JAMIE: So who's this
friend of yours?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.792
- He is not our friend.
- He's an ex-Marine,

07:30.951 --> 07:33.795
an animal rights activist,
and he spends a lot of time in Africa,

07:33.954 --> 07:36.173
interfering with poachers.
That's how Abe and I met him.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.754
- He's crazy.
JACKSON: He's not crazy.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.761
He's just not uncrazy.

07:41.920 --> 07:45.174
His group calls themselves the
Free Animal Rights Militia.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.184
F.A.R.M.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.637
That's clever.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.556
I've dealt with these kind of
people before. They're zealots.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.690
Don't know the first thing
about animal welfare.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.443
Well, not to mention some of us
are already wanted by the police.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.481
Maybe committing another
crime doesn't help our case.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.571
I agree, but we gotta get out of here,
and we gotta get out of here fast.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.493
I admit, okay? Ray,

08:09.656 --> 08:12.034
Ray can be a bit
of a loose cannon.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.044
Okay, maybe more than a bit.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.001
But everything he has ever
done has been for the animals.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.793
Look, I know desperate times
require desperate measures,

08:20.959 --> 08:22.506
but this isn't desperate.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.763
This is reckless.

08:24.921 --> 08:28.596
I understand your reservations,
Abraham, but I'm with Jackson.

08:28.758 --> 08:30.852
I don't really think we
have a better option.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.639
Look, no offense, Chloe,
but you don't know Ray Endicott.

08:33.804 --> 08:36.649
This is a terrible idea.

08:46.317 --> 08:50.743
The prime suspect in the murder
of FBI Special Agent Ben Shaffer.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.407
I gotta say, I'm with Abe.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.670
Meaning I'm anti-doing this
thing with these losers.

08:56.828 --> 08:59.126
But I'm just gonna
put this out there.

08:59.289 --> 09:02.668
We could probably get an
electroporator from that zoo.

09:03.334 --> 09:04.836
We could?

09:05.003 --> 09:06.880
Clearwater Zoo has
a pathology lab,

09:07.047 --> 09:09.015
which means they
most likely have one.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.344
Even so.

09:12.510 --> 09:13.807
Guys. Hey, guys, come in here.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.064
MAN [ON T\/]: Jackson
Oz, Chloe Tousignant,

09:16.222 --> 09:17.849
Abraham Kenyatta

09:18.016 --> 09:19.142
and Mitch Morgan.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.812
These four people are
all possible accomplices

09:21.978 --> 09:23.230
in Agent Shaffer's murder.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.195
We're asking anyone
who has seen them

09:26.357 --> 09:28.826
or who has any information
concerning their whereabouts,

09:28.985 --> 09:31.829
to please step forward
and contact us.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.411
Well, all of our names and
faces are out there now.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.499
The chances of us getting recognized,
getting caught, just quadrupled.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.710
Your friend is truly
the only hope we've got.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.711
He is not our friend.

09:50.215 --> 09:52.593
All right, so we've hit up
a couple of zoos before.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.683
We found what works best for
us is a two-pronged assault,

09:55.845 --> 09:59.019
so four of us are gonna go in
here, four of us in here.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.560
Toss in a couple of flash-bangs,
won't know what hit them.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.478
Flash-bangs? Seriously?

10:03.645 --> 10:05.272
MITCH: The etymology of the
term, gung ho

10:05.438 --> 10:07.691
comes from the Chinese
meaning work together,

10:07.857 --> 10:11.532
but I find it can also mean
excitable morons groping for a cause.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.446
You kidding me, man?

10:14.030 --> 10:18.001
My friend,
I wouldn't if I was you.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.997
Who are these guys again, Ray?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.756
These are some
old chums of mine,

10:23.915 --> 10:28.136
who are presently of the mind that
animals are uniting against us.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.716
Which we deserve, by the way.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.722
Good for them.
I mean, we have been eating them

10:31.881 --> 10:33.804
and keeping them in cages
since the dawn of time.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.312
All right, how about we just focus on
what it is we're trying to do here.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.223
Okay, look, once we're in,
one of your people can go fetch

10:40.390 --> 10:43.314
the, uh, velociraptor
thing from the path-lab.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.693
Electroporator.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.063
Sure, that.

10:47.230 --> 10:50.154
Rest of us are gonna free the
animals, load them into the truck.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.818
We're in and out in
under 30 minutes.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.676
What if we try a
different approach?

10:54.821 --> 10:57.701
Yeah, like the one where we don't
break into the zoo to free the animals.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.496
What, you think this is funny?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.003
There's nothing funnier
than adrenaline junkies

11:02.162 --> 11:04.540
trying to mask their
thrill-seeking in altruism.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.128
Zoos' time have come and gone.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.259
Tell that to the dozens
of endangered species

11:08.418 --> 11:10.671
who have benefited from
captive breeding programs.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.805
All right, relax, relax.

11:12.964 --> 11:16.639
Anissa did a couple of tours in
Afghanistan, took some mortar fire.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.020
Unfortunately, doctors couldn't
save her sense of humor.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.307
Jackson? You were saying?

11:21.472 --> 11:25.477
I was thinking that maybe we
try more of a stealthy approach.

11:26.186 --> 11:29.190
One where we get in and out without
security even knowing we're there.

11:29.814 --> 11:30.986
And how do you propose that?

11:31.149 --> 11:32.526
We have a secret weapon.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.491
- Oh, you do? JACKSON: We do.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.698
Him.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.579
You gotta be kidding me.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.120
Well, as it turns
out, Miss Jarhead,

11:43.286 --> 11:44.959
I know a thing or
two about zoos.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.876
And Jamie knows a thing or two about
getting information from people.

11:51.002 --> 11:52.128
I understand, Dr. Mills,

11:52.295 --> 11:55.515
but it's against our policy to
grant access to our CCTV feed.

11:55.673 --> 11:57.753
Don't tell me that you understand.
If you understood,

11:57.884 --> 11:59.727
I wouldn't be wasting my
time explaining to you

11:59.886 --> 12:01.388
why I need access
to those feeds.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.101
Look, here's the deal.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.184
I am at a conference,
but I'm also in the middle

12:06.351 --> 12:08.399
of a very important
experiment at the zoo.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.321
Now, my assistant was
supposed to oversee it,

12:10.480 --> 12:11.982
but he got appendicitis,

12:12.148 --> 12:15.072
so I have to be in
two places at once.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.612
I need you to do this for me.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.832
I could just call your
supervisor, uh...

12:23.326 --> 12:24.327
Hank Lowenthal.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.041
Hank?

12:26.204 --> 12:27.251
You know Hank?

12:27.413 --> 12:29.381
Oh, Hank.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.417
Hank and I are old friends.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.803
His wife and I are in a book
club together. She just...

12:33.962 --> 12:36.932
She loves her John Grisham.

12:37.382 --> 12:38.383
Should I call him?

12:38.549 --> 12:40.267
No, no, it's okay. Um...

12:42.553 --> 12:44.976
I'm sending you the log-in
information right now.

12:45.848 --> 12:47.225
Thank you, thank you.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.393
I really appreciate this.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.840
I will make sure that I tell
Hank how helpful you've been.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.823
Oh. And, make sure that you send it
to that e-mail address I gave you.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.576
Will do, Dr. Mills. Okay.

12:59.696 --> 13:01.619
I don't know about this.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.666
About what? What?

13:03.825 --> 13:06.328
This, the cameras, everything.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.041
- But this part was your idea.
- I know, but.

13:11.207 --> 13:13.630
Look, it should work, it should work.
But what if it doesn't?

13:15.837 --> 13:18.010
Well, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna be breaking into a zoo

13:18.172 --> 13:20.425
with a bunch of
nut-job radicals,

13:20.591 --> 13:22.969
and nobody's gonna have my back.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.514
But I'm not worried about
that, you know why?

13:26.681 --> 13:29.480
- Why?
- Because I have faith in you.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.690
Got what you wanted.

13:32.186 --> 13:33.563
JAMIE: Okay.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.116
So how's this supposed to work?

13:37.567 --> 13:41.868
Well, I have access to all the
security camera feeds at the zoo.

13:42.697 --> 13:44.449
Right now, I'm logging in

13:44.615 --> 13:47.334
to the camera that looks
at the zebra enclosure.

13:48.244 --> 13:51.339
Okay. So that goes here.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.583
I see what the
security camera sees.

13:55.084 --> 13:56.802
And this one

13:56.961 --> 13:58.963
looks at the reptile house,

13:59.130 --> 14:00.632
so it goes there.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.142
So you're gonna be our eyes
and ears when we're inside?

14:03.301 --> 14:05.645
Yeah, I'll know where you are,
and I'll give you a heads up

14:05.803 --> 14:07.851
if there's any security
guards coming your way.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.939
- Seems complicated.
- Yeah, it is.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.149
No, it isn't. You got this.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.781
She's got this, right?
You got this.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.828
You know,
we usually just Cut all the wires.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.116
Which will deactivate the
security and the camera systems.

14:26.282 --> 14:29.752
We need the cameras active so Jamie
can advise us as to any guards.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.037
Look, I think it's red.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.879
Red's the alarm,
blue's security cameras.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.141
Hey, Jamie. How's that?

14:43.800 --> 14:45.677
Good job.
All the cameras are still up.

14:45.843 --> 14:48.972
Okay, tell Mitch and Chloe that
the alarms have been deactivated.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.856
Will do.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.397
That's a lucky guess.

- Roger that.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.364
MITCH: I got this.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.905
Worked at four
zoos in my career.

15:43.067 --> 15:46.867
The first one just kept
the factory default code.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.331
- Of course, that was a petting zoo.
- Great. What did the second zoo use?

16:00.543 --> 16:01.544
ANISSA: Yes.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.554
JACKSON: Good work. - Good luck.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.432
We tried liberating a few zebras
from a zoo in Tampa, few years ago.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.559
Ornery sons of
bitches wouldn't go.

16:08.718 --> 16:11.238
JACKSON: You gotta know how to
approach them. Zebras scare easy.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.014
Come at them straight,

16:13.181 --> 16:15.934
they don't think you're
trying to sneak up on them.

16:29.947 --> 16:32.200

straight for you.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.243

16:36.496 --> 16:38.590
Jackson,
the guard is 50 feet away.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.491
- Jackson?
- I gotta move slow,

16:41.626 --> 16:43.594

display and a couple of knobs.

- What happened?
- Ray got shot and Cody is dead

19:25.581 --> 19:28.181
because we didn't have backup we
counted on. That's what happened.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.757
Backup you could count on.

Probably better that way.

only he wasn't any other guest.

24:04.401 --> 24:08.702
He was using our safari as a cover
to scope out poachers in the area.

24:08.864 --> 24:11.037
What's wrong with that?
I figure you'd be anti-poacher.

24:11.200 --> 24:14.795
Of course I am. But then,
when Ray later sabotaged the poachers,

24:14.954 --> 24:17.798
they traced him back to us.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.839
And they put quite a
beating on Jackson.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.130
If I hadn't arrived,
they may have killed him.

Ray had a shipment of weapons

You see, Ray had convinced Jackson
to accompany him to Nairobi

24:51.240 --> 24:55.086

proficient group of big-game hunters.

had walked into a trap.

25:03.043 --> 25:05.637
Ray had become such a thorn
in the paw of these hunters,

25:05.796 --> 25:07.719
that they wanted
to get rid of him,

25:07.881 --> 25:10.930

I had to go to Nairobi.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.470
I got this.

38:18.546 --> 38:19.923
- No!
- No!

38:20.089 --> 38:21.306
No!

38:21.466 --> 38:22.718
Chloe!

38:25.303 --> 38:26.930
- Anissa!
- Chloe!

38:51.412 --> 38:53.710
- She's all yours.
MAN: Yes, sir.

38:55.750 --> 38:57.844
This one's all mine.
