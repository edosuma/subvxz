We, uh, we caught this killer,

37:42.840 --> 37:44.205

37:44.275 --> 37:45.333
And now you're wondering

37:45.577 --> 37:46.942
if there really was
a connection.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.872
You know, when I, uh...

37:50.949 --> 37:52.883
I first came
to work at the F.B.I.

37:52.951 --> 37:54.612
I worked at Violent Crimes

37:54.686 --> 37:57.553
and I saw the worst
of humanity.

37:57.622 --> 37:58.953
I saw monsters

37:59.023 --> 38:02.720
and I wondered
how they became that way

38:02.794 --> 38:04.762
how these men became so evil.

38:04.829 --> 38:07.923
I know there were
psychological explanations--

38:07.999 --> 38:11.833
victims of their environment,
victims of their parents--

38:11.903 --> 38:14.599
but the scientific explanations
were never truly satisfying

38:14.672 --> 38:18.233
and I began to think about evil
like a disease.

38:18.309 --> 38:21.574
You know, that it goes
from man to man or age to age.

38:21.646 --> 38:23.341
Most of us walk
around thinking

38:23.581 --> 38:25.640
we're incapable
of any acts of evil

38:25.717 --> 38:26.911
and we are.

38:26.985 --> 38:28.247
You know, we can stifle

38:28.286 --> 38:30.220
that momentary urge
to kill or to hurt.

38:30.288 --> 38:33.655
We have some kind
of immunity to it

38:33.725 --> 38:35.590
but I think
it's possible that there's...

38:38.029 --> 38:39.758
an occurrence in somebody's life

38:39.797 --> 38:41.287
a tragedy or a loss

38:41.366 --> 38:44.130
that leaves them vulnerable

38:44.202 --> 38:46.636
hurts their immunity to evil

38:46.671 --> 38:47.968
and all of a sudden

38:48.039 --> 38:50.405
at that point in their lives

38:50.642 --> 38:54.408
when they're weakened,
they're open to evil

38:54.646 --> 38:56.876
and they can become evil.

38:56.948 --> 39:00.349
If that were true,
then what you're saying is...

39:00.418 --> 39:03.683
is that this man
we wheeled in here tonight
