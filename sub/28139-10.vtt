WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.267
- Previously, on "Good Girls."

00:06.310 --> 00:08.443
- He left me,
and he took my kids.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.445
What do you want?
- I want you done.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.099
I want my family safe.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.491
- How's it going
with the sister?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.580
- I'm out of the friend zone.
- Already?

00:15.624 --> 00:17.582
- Do you, like, live here now?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.149
Because you're here,
like, a lot.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.499
I'm a D-bag, so I know
when I see one.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.545
- Well, I stole
from my last job.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.200
- What did you steal?
- Money. Lots of it.

00:26.243 --> 00:29.681
- We are so much more alike
that you could ever know.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553
- Feds, they opened up an IA
deal or whatever.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.337
- I literally have no idea
what you're saying.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.383
- Internal Affairs, okay?
They investigate dirty cops.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.081
- Did you remove a pen cap
from the evidence locker?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.517
- I failed.
- Like, inconclusive?

00:39.561 --> 00:41.215
- Capital F, failed.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.651
- Did he do
what they said he did?

00:42.694 --> 00:44.696
- Yes.
- Then he should stay in jail.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.264
- It's over. They got me.
I'm out on leave.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.268
- I'm done.
- Is that right?

00:51.312 --> 00:54.184
- No more cash. No more pills.
It's over.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.534
- Which part?
- All of it.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.493
Bring the children home, okay?

01:03.802 --> 01:07.719
It's cost me everything
at this point.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.635
But my...

01:10.679 --> 01:15.510
rock bottom or whatever, um...

01:15.553 --> 01:18.295
was when I lost my family.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.418
- The thing is, you have
no idea how far you've fallen

01:54.462 --> 01:56.246
until you get some distance.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.383
I've had cops in my kitchen.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.645
I've...

02:07.170 --> 02:09.607
Taken my kids to a crack house.

02:16.484 --> 02:21.315
I've lied. I've cheated.
I've stolen.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.675
I've had a gun to my head
so many times

02:33.718 --> 02:35.677
that it doesn't even
scare me anymore.

02:38.810 --> 02:42.510
A full clip adds a pound.

02:42.553 --> 02:45.817
It's like...

02:45.861 --> 02:47.819
why do I know that?

02:47.863 --> 02:50.648
I shouldn't know that.

03:09.014 --> 03:14.324
â™ª Oh, Lord, I've lost it now

03:32.473 --> 03:34.910
- I just have to stop.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.872
I want to be normal.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.578
And I can't lose my kids again.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.718
My name is Beth.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.460
And I am an addict.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.332
all: Hi, Beth.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.857
- I'm going to need one of
you here and one of you here,

04:08.900 --> 04:14.863
and I'll hold down the middle
over here with the goodies.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.430
Who's on masks?

04:16.473 --> 04:18.388
- Uh, how about a big leaf?

04:18.432 --> 04:20.869
- Or a fluffy turkey?
- Ooh, Indian headdress.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.263
- Not cool,
- Why not?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.569
- It's cultural appropriation.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.049
both: Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.659
- Why don't we
avoid any land mines

04:28.703 --> 04:29.921
and just keep this fall themed?

04:29.965 --> 04:32.446
- Oh, thank God you're back.
- Right?

04:32.489 --> 04:33.969
- Where's our homegirl been?

04:34.012 --> 04:35.797
- Life got a little crazy
for a second.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.712
- All I got to say
is Carol filled in for you.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.888
- Oh, do not.
- She didn't want to do themes.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.369
- For the parties?
- It was nuts.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.023
- Oh, speaking of which.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.723
Okay, so we have
acorn thumbprints,

04:48.766 --> 04:49.898
and see, the Hershey kiss
is the little acorn.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.291
- Oh, that's so cute.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.467
- And we got turkey cake pops.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.077
We've got little squirrely
sweet treats,

04:55.120 --> 04:56.296
and I cannot with
this pretzel tail.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.775
- Stop!
- Beth!

04:57.819 --> 04:58.907
- Can you even?

04:58.950 --> 04:59.908
And then, we've got

04:59.951 --> 05:01.605
Gobble Gobble Maple Crumble.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.867
- Oh, wait.
- Uh--

05:02.911 --> 05:04.782
- What?
- Um, those look like

05:04.826 --> 05:06.958
walnuts on top.
- So?

05:07.002 --> 05:10.353
- Oh, walnuts are nuts.
- Well, they're not peanuts.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.355
- Nut family.
- Well, who in

05:12.399 --> 05:13.661
our class is allergic?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.621
- Uh, Cooper doesn't like them.
- Right.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.016
- Well, that's not an allergy.
And you know what else?

05:23.584 --> 05:26.064
All of this...

05:26.108 --> 05:29.590
filled with gluten.
- Oh, my God.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.896
- I mean, where are the
gluten issues in Africa?

05:31.940 --> 05:36.423
Or Brazil?
Or anywhere except for here?

05:36.466 --> 05:39.556
Right?
- Oh, you're bad.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.993
- What happened to you?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.560
- I like it.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.736
- Let's live a little.
-  Okay!

05:45.780 --> 05:47.912
- Annie Marks,
please report to produce.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.656
- We can never
sell this lettuce.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.832
- Hey, question.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.574
- What do you think is worse?
The sex or the pesticides?

05:57.618 --> 06:01.796
- Um, does our insurance
cover puberty blockers?

06:03.188 --> 06:05.365
I think that ship has sailed.
- Has it?

06:05.408 --> 06:06.540
- Yeah, honey,
you're a woman now.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.716
- Mm, it's for my kid.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.153
It's kind of, like the next
step, and he's really stoked.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.503
- Uh-huh.
- So, you know.

06:13.547 --> 06:17.159
- Look, well, I'll check,
but we are Fine and Frugal.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Emphasis on the "frugal."

06:18.726 --> 06:20.945
- Mm, right.
- Yeah.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.383
- But you know,
I could pick up extra shifts

06:23.426 --> 06:26.516
or I could--you know,
I'd mop the butcher floor

06:26.560 --> 06:29.432
or unclog toilets, or--
you know, whatever.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.694
I'm just saying,
something to think about.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.435
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.526
- Well, come on,
I'm still down.

06:36.570 --> 06:41.618
- Yeah, blood, bathrooms,
your child's trans journey--

06:41.662 --> 06:44.491
it's, uh--
- It's a lot of imagery.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.537
- Yeah.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.800
I can--I can look
at the schedule.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.150
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.676
Uh--

07:01.638 --> 07:03.771
Hey, uh...

07:03.814 --> 07:07.862
what about your
extracurriculars?

07:07.905 --> 07:11.431
- Oh.
Those are over.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.563
- Huh. Why?

07:13.607 --> 07:18.438
- It's--it's, like,
a whole thing with my sister.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.091
- That sucks.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.833
How bad do you need the money?

07:33.801 --> 07:35.629
Kale.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.457
- Hmm.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.597
- Guilty?
- That's what he wants.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.730
- Why?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.209
- I'm--I'm just another file
in his stack, Ruby.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.776
I mean, you should
see this guy.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.039
He'd rather go play
racquetball or golf.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.128
- The court-appointed ones
can't afford golf.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.652
- Well, that's what it is.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.218
- Then we'll get you
a real lawyer.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.525
- You know how much that costs?

08:02.569 --> 08:05.615
- Stan, you're not
pleading guilty.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
- Babe, do you want to eat
or keep the lights on?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.966
Because that's where
we are this month.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.577
Okay, I got no paycheck
coming in.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.926
I can't even get my old job
back at the mall

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
because they think
I'm a fel--

08:14.842 --> 08:17.497
That better not be a phone.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.803
Hey, you got your ears on,
Journey Scout?

08:21.239 --> 08:24.112
- Excuse you, miss.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.983
Your father is speaking to you.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.637
- Hey.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.291
No phones
during homework, baby.

08:29.334 --> 08:32.599
- And no pop after dinner.
-  Oh, my bad.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.560
I didn't think we still
followed rules around here.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.999
- Oh, you're gonna have
your hands full.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.697
- What are you talking about?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.917
- When I go away.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.838
- It's cheating.
- It's fine.

08:54.882 --> 08:59.060
- It's an affair.
- Oh, come on.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.584
- What do you call it?

09:01.628 --> 09:04.892
- It's maybe
an emotional affair,

09:04.935 --> 09:06.241
which is, like,
barely even a thing.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.243
- Hoda says that's worse.
- Oh.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.854
You know, we're doing Beth
a favor.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.726
- How's that?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.945
- You don't take
an alcoholic to a bar.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.777
- How's this even
going to work?

09:20.821 --> 09:22.692
- We just keep
the trains running.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.564
- Without the dealership?

09:24.607 --> 09:27.305
- Well, I'm kicking around
some ideas.

09:29.786 --> 09:33.007
- You are?
- I am.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.835
- Well, as long
as it doesn't involve

09:34.878 --> 09:40.710
shoving anything up our--
- Sara needs her badges, right?

09:40.754 --> 09:43.670
- Oh, hell, no!
- Okay, will you just chill?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.846
- I'm not going to let you
shove things up my child's--

09:45.889 --> 09:48.762
- Bus!
- What?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.067
- Customs is never
going to search

09:50.111 --> 09:51.634
a bus full of Journey Scouts.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
I mean, they're
practically nuns.

09:55.725 --> 09:56.987
- Jesus.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.295
- Oh, I'm sorry,
what was your idea again?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.253
Because I'm open.
- I don't know.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.778
- Mm, shocking.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.216
- That was Beth's thing.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.919
- Or...

10:15.963 --> 10:17.094
- Or?

10:17.138 --> 10:20.881
- Or we locate
a travelling circus

10:20.924 --> 10:23.318
and we find the elephants
or whatever

10:23.361 --> 10:24.928
the largest mammals are
we can find

10:24.972 --> 10:26.713
and we cram the pills
up one of their--

10:26.756 --> 10:27.931
- Hey, ladies.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.287
So how are we
going to do this?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.775
- So it's about a dead girl?

10:45.819 --> 10:48.169
- No, she gets in an accident,
and when she wakes up,

10:48.212 --> 10:51.520
she has no memory and she has
to sort of start her life over.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.696
- So it's a medical
mystery thing?

10:53.740 --> 10:57.395
- More like she has to sort of
figure out who she wants to be.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.136
- Do you actually
see the accident?

10:59.180 --> 11:01.051
Because I am not
good with blood.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.314
- Mm, probably
can't see anything

11:03.358 --> 11:04.707
because it's a book.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.491
- Oh, thank you, professor.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.450
- Hey, is it on Netflix?

11:08.493 --> 11:10.800
- Hey, you guys wash up.
We're going to eat.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.376
- So you're totally okay
with all this?

11:21.419 --> 11:23.639
- What?

11:23.683 --> 11:27.295
- You know...actual book club?

11:31.081 --> 11:33.562
- I mean...

11:33.605 --> 11:35.564
what about you guys?

11:35.607 --> 11:40.612
- Well, kind of miss the money.
- Not going to lie.

11:40.656 --> 11:45.530
- Yeah, how's Stan's lawyer?
- Super. Real shark.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.228
- Well, maybe when
the dealership

11:47.271 --> 11:49.099
gets back on its feet,
I could pitch in and--

11:49.143 --> 11:52.233
- Hey, we'll get by.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.809
- How do you think
he's going to do it?

12:05.681 --> 12:07.683
Without us?
- Oh, I don't know.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.293
There's always some idiot

12:09.337 --> 12:12.340
willing to do
something stupid for money.

12:12.383 --> 12:16.300
- So, do you guys want to
come to book club or not?

12:16.344 --> 12:21.871
- Ooh, gee, we would but...

12:21.915 --> 12:26.789
we kind of have, like, a thing.
- Oh.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.879
- Otherwise,
I would totally love

12:29.923 --> 12:33.491
to pretend to have read it.

12:45.852 --> 12:50.160
- All right, you guys.
Come and get it.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.640
- You want your service badge
or not?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.381
- Why do we have to
go to Canada?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.905
- Because that's where
the nursing home is.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.820
- Can't we visit one here?

12:57.864 --> 13:00.170
- Old people
are lonelier there.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.346
- Because of
socialized medicine?

13:02.390 --> 13:04.740
- Yeah.
- Wait, that makes no sense.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
- Okay, you know what?
Bed time.

13:06.829 --> 13:10.398
Daddy will be in for prayers.
- No thanks.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.140
- To Daddy or prayers?

13:13.183 --> 13:15.490
- Both.
- Excuse you.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.753
- We're just going to act
like we're good people now?

13:17.797 --> 13:18.928
- We are good people.

13:18.972 --> 13:21.844
- He stole, you lied,

13:21.888 --> 13:23.803
and I still can't borrow
the neighbor's Internet.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.587
- Sara Louise Hill--
- It makes about as much sense

13:25.630 --> 13:28.503
as going to Canada
to get my service badge.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.560
- Green for grass
or blue for sky?

13:44.780 --> 13:46.738
- What about red?

13:46.782 --> 13:49.350
- For what?
Like a sunset?

13:49.393 --> 13:50.699
- I mean, it's a balloon.

13:50.742 --> 13:54.572
We don't have to
be literal, right?

13:54.616 --> 13:57.184
- Let's do green.
- For grass.

13:57.227 --> 13:59.708
- Leaves or pumpkins?

13:59.751 --> 14:01.231
- Leaves.

14:01.275 --> 14:04.495
- Maple or oak?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.889
- Oak.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.673
- Brown or tan?

14:10.284 --> 14:12.373
- Turkeys or corn stalks?

14:12.416 --> 14:14.244
- â™ª I know you think
I'm a psychopath â™ª

14:14.288 --> 14:15.898
- Beth?

14:15.942 --> 14:19.249
- â™ª A Democrat lurking
in the dark â™ª

14:19.293 --> 14:21.686
- What?
- Turkeys or corn stalks?

14:21.730 --> 14:24.602
- â™ª Cirque du trash,
I kept the stash â™ª

14:24.646 --> 14:26.648
- Turkey.
- Mm.

14:26.691 --> 14:27.910
- Corn stalks.
- â™ª Cocoa candy

14:27.954 --> 14:29.999
â™ª Straight from Japan

14:30.043 --> 14:32.828
- Are they too sexual?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.004
- Oh, yeah, that's, uh--

14:35.048 --> 14:37.528
- â™ª I know you know
what I need to get by â™ª

14:37.572 --> 14:39.356
- You know what
the sixth grade started?

14:39.400 --> 14:40.749
- What?
- Mom's night out.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.229
- â™ª Mind
- â™ª Mind

14:42.272 --> 14:44.231
- They watched "Magic Mike."
- No!

14:44.274 --> 14:45.928
- â™ª Something for your
- What, with the kids there?

14:45.972 --> 14:47.756
- â™ª Mind
- No, they were at Brooke's.

14:47.799 --> 14:50.367
- We have to do that.
Throw in some margaritas.

14:50.411 --> 14:51.760
Let's get loose!
- â™ª Mind

14:51.803 --> 14:53.762
- â™ª Something
for your mind â™ª

14:53.805 --> 14:55.938
â™ª Mind

14:55.982 --> 14:57.940
- â™ª Mind, mind

14:57.984 --> 15:00.595
â™ª Something for your

15:00.638 --> 15:02.945
- â™ª Mind

15:02.989 --> 15:04.991
â™ª Mind, mind

15:05.034 --> 15:07.558
â™ª Something for your,
for your â™ª

15:08.864 --> 15:13.695
- â™ª M-I, M-I,
M-I â™ª

15:13.738 --> 15:15.523
â™ª M-I-N-D

15:15.566 --> 15:18.613
- â™ª For us, the bourgeoisie

15:18.656 --> 15:20.484
â™ª So carefree

15:20.528 --> 15:23.444
â™ª Remember when we?

15:23.487 --> 15:26.751
â™ª I don't know what
you need to get by â™ª

15:26.795 --> 15:30.799
â™ª Something for your mind
- â™ª Mind

15:30.842 --> 15:32.627
- â™ª Mind
- â™ª Mind

15:32.670 --> 15:34.542
- â™ª Mind
- â™ª Mind

15:34.585 --> 15:36.370
â™ª Something for your

15:36.413 --> 15:39.895
â™ª Mind, mind, mind

15:53.039 --> 15:55.563
- Beth?

15:55.606 --> 15:56.999
- Are you coming?

15:57.043 --> 15:58.609
- â™ª Mind
- â™ª Mind

15:58.653 --> 16:01.699
- â™ª Mind
- â™ª I-N-D

16:01.743 --> 16:03.353
- Boy, once again,
I am really sorry.

16:03.397 --> 16:05.703
I--you know, we don't have
a lot of control

16:05.747 --> 16:07.488
over what happens
to these things

16:07.531 --> 16:08.924
once they're put
on the shelves,

16:08.968 --> 16:11.840
but if you head over
to customer service,

16:11.883 --> 16:13.711
they'll give you a full refund.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.018
And you have
a fine and frugal day.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.588
You know, these people
need to lighten up.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.024
She just got a half
a cigarette for free.

16:32.904 --> 16:36.038
That's actionable.
- Mm.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.824
Hey, um...

16:39.868 --> 16:42.827
is there any way I can have
the day off tomorrow?

16:42.871 --> 16:45.830
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, I, uh--

16:45.874 --> 16:51.010
took your advice,
and I have an extracurricular.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.621
- Model UN?
- Something like that.

16:53.664 --> 16:55.579
- Yeah, you go, Kofi.

16:55.623 --> 16:58.539
- Did you just make
a Kofi Annan reference?

16:58.582 --> 17:02.543
- I did.
-  I love you.

17:02.586 --> 17:05.111
When you make...

17:05.154 --> 17:08.157
references to former
world leaders.

17:08.201 --> 17:11.421
- Mm-hmm.
- Also, he's dead.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.077
I'm gonna dip.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.603
- Hey.

17:19.647 --> 17:23.607
I love...

17:23.651 --> 17:25.870
I love that you
said his name right.

17:27.611 --> 17:31.659
- There's just so much
to love about Kofi.

17:31.702 --> 17:32.921
- Well, he redefined the UN.

17:32.964 --> 17:35.010
- I'm going to go.
- Go.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.062
The pills come across the
border right here in Detroit.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.846
There is a wide range,

17:44.889 --> 17:47.588
some of them controlled,
all of them prescription-grade.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.547
They distro through a
sophisticated street network.

17:50.591 --> 17:53.768
- How you want to play it?
- I think it's go time.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.857
We hit them fast,
hit them hard.

17:55.900 --> 17:57.424
- Ladies and gentlemen,
you heard the man.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.121
Let's get this party started.

18:02.690 --> 18:05.867
- You hanging in?
- Yeah, I just want it over.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.565
- Burritos on you
tomorrow night.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.611
- Great.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.008
-  â™ª This
is the song that never ends â™ª

18:17.052 --> 18:19.968
â™ª It will go on and on,
my friend â™ª

18:20.011 --> 18:22.188
â™ª Some people started singing
it â™ª

18:22.231 --> 18:24.233
â™ª Not knowing what it was

18:24.277 --> 18:28.368
â™ª And they'll continue singing
it forever just because... â™ª

18:28.411 --> 18:31.893
- Who is that?
- One of my mom's friends.

18:31.936 --> 18:33.460
- Come on!
â™ª It will go on and on--

18:33.503 --> 18:35.026
And we can do it in a round,
so you go--

18:35.070 --> 18:37.072
â™ª It will go on and on my--

18:37.116 --> 18:39.422
and then, you go
â™ª It will go on and on

18:39.466 --> 18:42.208
â™ª My friends

18:43.339 --> 18:44.775
â™ª Started singing it

18:44.819 --> 18:47.430
â™ª Not knowing what it was

18:47.474 --> 18:50.129
â™ª And they'll continue
singing it forever, just-- â™ª

18:50.172 --> 18:52.043
- How about you stop now?

18:52.087 --> 18:54.045
- How about you chill out?

18:54.089 --> 18:55.743
- We're not at camp.

18:55.786 --> 18:58.006
- Doesn't mean
we can't have fun.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.877
- Let's just do this
without getting...

18:59.921 --> 19:01.705
arrested.

19:01.749 --> 19:04.273
- Okay.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.149
- Can I get a juice box?

19:10.192 --> 19:13.239
- Well, I don't know, can you?

19:13.282 --> 19:16.198
Yes, you may.

19:16.242 --> 19:19.201
Have a juice box.
Enjoy.

19:19.245 --> 19:23.074
- So why are you here?
- Are you kidding me?

19:23.118 --> 19:26.513
I was big in all that.
- What badges did you get?

19:26.556 --> 19:29.080
- Like, almost every
single one.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.170
I only had to drop out
because I got knocked up.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.959
- Seriously?

19:38.002 --> 19:40.135
- Well, actually, I only
made it to Brown Birds.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.226
But Beth, she went all the way.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.231
â™ª Song that never--

20:09.251 --> 20:12.036
- You, uh--you okay?

20:12.080 --> 20:14.430
- Fall festival and book club.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.479
Book-club book club.
- Yes, got it.

20:19.522 --> 20:22.830
- Careful, they're hot.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.573
- So you want to
stop by work tomorrow

20:26.616 --> 20:28.488
and check out the new promo?

20:28.531 --> 20:32.274
- Can you take Kenny to swim?
- Sure.

20:32.318 --> 20:34.494
- Yeah, you can tell Linda
that I'll stop by.

20:34.537 --> 20:38.280
- I will.

20:38.324 --> 20:42.066
So, do you miss it?

20:42.110 --> 20:43.938
- I don't need
to be there every day.

20:43.981 --> 20:46.941
- I'm not talking about
the dealership.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.509
- Would it matter if I did?

20:55.036 --> 20:58.126
- This is delicious.

21:09.050 --> 21:11.182
- â™ª This land
is your land â™ª

21:11.226 --> 21:13.924
â™ª This land is my land

21:13.968 --> 21:16.840
â™ª From California

21:16.884 --> 21:19.016
â™ª To the New York island

21:19.060 --> 21:21.889
â™ª From the Redwood Forest

21:21.932 --> 21:25.545
â™ª To the Gulf Stream waters

21:25.588 --> 21:29.375
â™ª This land was made
for you and me â™ª

21:31.681 --> 21:33.857
- I'm looking for
a Beth Boland.

21:37.426 --> 21:40.124
- You found her.

21:40.168 --> 21:42.518
- â™ª I saw below me

21:42.562 --> 21:46.348
â™ª That golden valley

21:46.392 --> 21:50.221
â™ª This land was made
for you and me â™ª

21:50.265 --> 21:53.268
â™ª When the sun came shining

21:53.312 --> 21:56.227
â™ª And I was strolling

21:56.271 --> 22:01.015
â™ª And the wheat fields waving
and the dust clouds rolling â™ª

22:01.058 --> 22:03.670
â™ª And the fog was lifting

22:03.713 --> 22:07.282
â™ª A voice was chanting

22:07.326 --> 22:11.504
â™ª This land was made
for you and me â™ª

22:11.547 --> 22:14.333
â™ª As I went walking

22:14.376 --> 22:17.379
â™ª I saw a sign there

22:17.423 --> 22:22.428
â™ª And on the sign it
said "no trespassing" â™ª

22:22.471 --> 22:25.082
â™ª But on the other side

22:25.126 --> 22:28.564
â™ª It didn't say nothing

22:28.608 --> 22:33.003
â™ª That side was made
for you and me â™ª

22:33.047 --> 22:35.571
â™ª In the shadow
of the steeple â™ª

22:35.615 --> 22:38.531
â™ª I saw my people

22:38.574 --> 22:43.666
â™ª By the relief office,
I've seen my people â™ª

22:43.710 --> 22:46.669
â™ª As they stood there hungry

22:46.713 --> 22:50.020
â™ª I stood there asking

22:50.064 --> 22:54.111
â™ª Is this land made
for you and me? â™ª

22:54.155 --> 22:57.288
â™ª Nobody living

22:57.332 --> 22:59.987
â™ª Can ever stop me

23:00.030 --> 23:02.424
â™ª As I go walking

23:02.468 --> 23:05.209
â™ª That freedom highway

23:05.253 --> 23:07.473
â™ª Nobody living

23:07.516 --> 23:11.259
â™ª Can ever
make me turn back â™ª

23:11.302 --> 23:16.307
â™ª This land was made
for you and me â™ª

23:16.351 --> 23:20.311
- And I'm thankful for waffles
and Missy, my doll.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.444
And that my mom doesn't
go to work as much

23:22.488 --> 23:25.012
so she can play with me.

23:29.669 --> 23:32.454
- These are the moments
you just can't miss, right?

23:32.498 --> 23:35.283
- Right.

23:47.382 --> 23:49.645
- Oh, I didn't even go there.
- Oh, God.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.647
But you know what?
She is so great.

23:51.691 --> 23:53.562
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Oh, my God.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.695
Jane was the most adorable
thing I've ever seen.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.523
- Yeah, she's hilarious.

23:57.566 --> 24:00.090
What happened to
all the stuff I made?

24:00.134 --> 24:02.441
The cupcakes and the crumble?

24:04.181 --> 24:05.792
- Oh, um...
- Oh.

24:05.835 --> 24:07.794
- Right.
- Beth, we just got

24:07.837 --> 24:10.492
a little nervous
about the nut thing.

24:10.536 --> 24:12.233
- Yeah, and not to mention
all that gluten.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.800
- Yeah, so we had Trish
run out to Kroger

24:13.843 --> 24:16.237
just to be safe.
- They were gorgeous, though.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.326
And we had them all wrapped up
so you can take them home.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.374
- So, um, I was thinking.

24:23.418 --> 24:27.509
How about a mom night
in early January?

24:27.553 --> 24:29.380
- Well, actually,
February might be better

24:29.424 --> 24:32.514
because of the winter carnival.
- That work for you, Beth?

24:32.558 --> 24:34.777
Beth?

25:46.806 --> 25:49.635
- We're good?
- Locked and loaded.

25:51.854 --> 25:53.464
- Uh, hey, guys.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.118
Here, pass these out
for me, would you?

25:55.162 --> 25:57.338
Thank you.

25:57.381 --> 25:59.122
All right, I think I'm
going to pee again.

25:59.166 --> 26:01.560
I really like the toilets here.
They're so high up.

26:07.174 --> 26:09.306
- What's your secret?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.136
- Sorry?

26:13.180 --> 26:14.616
- When mine was their age,

26:14.660 --> 26:18.620
she was already smoking dope
and stealing cars.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.797
- Well, give her a minute.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.147
- Mm-mm, I don't think so.
Not that one.

26:24.191 --> 26:26.367
She taught me Snapchat.

26:26.410 --> 26:29.370
- I am so sorry.
- She's patient.

26:32.634 --> 26:34.244
- Well, she just
came out like that.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.159
- That's not
how it works, honey.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.466
I had eight.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.337
- No wonder you're in a chair.

26:42.470 --> 26:46.213
Well, whatever you're doing,
it's working.

26:47.780 --> 26:50.260
Bye.

27:05.841 --> 27:07.800
- Passports.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.761
- Here you go.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.420
- Quick trip today?
- Oh, yeah.

27:19.463 --> 27:22.336
You know, just keeping up
international relations.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.599
- They just earned
their service badge

27:24.643 --> 27:26.601
at Mallard Pond Senior Center.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.745
- Would you like some water?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.015
- Thanks for
your service, girls.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.936
- See?
Piece of cake.

28:33.973 --> 28:36.497
- I took it all out.

28:43.286 --> 28:48.335
- Back on the bus in ten.
- Stick with your buddies.

28:48.378 --> 28:52.295
That goes for you, too, Karen.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.993
- I panicked, okay?
- No.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.908
- I couldn't do it.
- No, no, no, no, no!

28:55.951 --> 28:58.345
- We're supposed to be making
them better people, not this.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.478
- What did you do with them?
- In the garbage at the place.

29:01.522 --> 29:05.613
- Oh, my God, you left
our payday in a trash can?

29:05.656 --> 29:07.963
- We could have gotten caught.
- But we didn't.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.486
- With a bunch of drugs
in front of Sara.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.575
- It was the perfect plan.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.361
You know if Beth
had suggested this,

29:14.404 --> 29:15.492
you would have been all in.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.146
- Like I'm some kind
of yes-man?

29:17.190 --> 29:19.192
- "Hey, Ruby, want to rob
a grocery store?"

29:19.235 --> 29:20.976
"Sure, Beth."
"Hey, Ruby.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.587
Want to drink some gasoline?"
"Yeah, sounds yum, Beth.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.459
Pour it in my mouth."
- Okay, you know what--

29:25.502 --> 29:28.854
- But of course, when I come up
with a sound solution--

29:28.897 --> 29:31.378
- Oh, you mean this
or up an elephant ass?

29:31.421 --> 29:34.207
- Yes, I put two viable options
on the table,

29:34.250 --> 29:36.209
and all you had to do
was choose one.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.907
- You know what?
You're right.

29:38.951 --> 29:42.389
You're not Beth.
You never will be.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.912
You know what you are?
- Please.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.001
- You're a child.
You do whatever you want

29:46.045 --> 29:47.437
whenever you want.
- I take risks, Ruby.

29:47.481 --> 29:50.223
- Without thinking about
anyone else but yourself.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.574
- Just because I didn't choose
some safe-ass,

29:53.617 --> 29:55.315
boring-ass life
like my sister--

29:55.358 --> 29:58.971
- You know why she did that?
Because she had to.

29:59.014 --> 30:02.931
She didn't have anyone to
clean up after her like you do.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.892
- That's not true.
- She has been

30:06.935 --> 30:10.460
mopping up your messes
since the day I met you.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.245
- I'm really glad that I can be

30:12.288 --> 30:15.988
such a convenient excuse
for everyone.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.903
- What does that even mean?

30:17.946 --> 30:20.253
- Well, now when Stan
goes to jail,

30:20.296 --> 30:23.082
you'll have someone else
to blame.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.301
- Anyone want dibs
on a Slim Jim?

30:25.345 --> 30:27.216
The machine gave me two.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.185
- You sang songs
and braided hair?

30:39.228 --> 30:41.448
- Ugh, it's, like,
a troop thing.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.624
- That's terrifying.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.757
- â™ª This is the song
that never ends â™ª

30:46.801 --> 30:49.151
- Stop.
- â™ª It will go on and on

30:49.195 --> 30:52.285
â™ª My friend
- Oh, my God.

30:52.328 --> 30:53.634
- Go on, open the drawer.
Come on.

30:53.677 --> 30:55.375
- Okay, okay.

31:01.555 --> 31:05.341
- You like-y?
- Why?

31:05.385 --> 31:08.692
- Well, I mean, you needed
new ones anyway.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.781
- They look expensive.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.480
- Nah, they came
in a three-pack.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.569
- They're dope.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.356
- The, um...

31:24.317 --> 31:26.754
The medicine
might have to wait.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.672
It's just--
it costs so much more

31:31.715 --> 31:34.370
than I have right now,
you know?

31:34.414 --> 31:36.720
- Okay.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.287
- I'm sorry.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.161
- I'm going to get something
to drink.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.728
- Hey, um...

31:44.772 --> 31:47.296
am I a mess?

31:49.516 --> 31:54.434
I just mean, like,
relative to the other moms.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.179
- Medium.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.571
- Seriously?

32:03.269 --> 32:05.140
Here's the thing:
most private school kids

32:05.184 --> 32:06.533
think their parents
are perfect.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.274
They're going to be
majorly freaked out

32:08.317 --> 32:09.623
when they realize they're not.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.451
- Hm.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.193
- But with you, I already
know what I'm dealing with.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.717
So I'm, like, not that damaged.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.765
- Thanks.

32:25.769 --> 32:29.295
- Want anything to drink?
- I'm okay.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.284
- That bad, huh?

33:07.637 --> 33:10.727
So they suck your soul out yet
or what?

33:10.771 --> 33:12.642
- What are you doing here?

33:12.686 --> 33:15.689
- I tried calling.
- I blocked your number.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.433
Damn, that's cold.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.435
- I'm sure you'll get over it.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.740
- I just wanted to make sure

33:23.784 --> 33:26.308
you were in the loop
about stuff.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.790
- Well don't, okay?

33:29.833 --> 33:32.140
- Okay.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.534
So you're all good, then?

33:34.577 --> 33:36.405
- I'm good.

33:36.449 --> 33:39.539
I'm great.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.323
- All right, then, yeah.

33:41.367 --> 33:45.588
You don't--you don't got
to know about this, then.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.551
- Know what?

33:55.511 --> 33:57.209
What?

34:02.388 --> 34:03.867
Where are they?
- What?

34:03.911 --> 34:05.478
- The books, Dean.
They're not in the cabinet.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.393
- What's going on?
- Where are the books?

34:07.436 --> 34:08.785
- Uh, they're--
they're in accounting.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.310
- Not those books.
The book club books.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.920
- Why?

34:17.968 --> 34:23.322
- â™ª The night
would never end â™ª

34:23.365 --> 34:28.501
â™ª In your sleep,
you called me Natalie â™ª

34:28.544 --> 34:31.504
â™ª It was the nicest
thing you said â™ª

34:31.547 --> 34:34.594
- Everybody down on the ground.

34:34.637 --> 34:37.379
- FBI!

34:40.774 --> 34:43.733
- Don't move!

34:43.777 --> 34:47.302
- Where is she?
- Who?

34:47.346 --> 34:49.174
- Sir!

34:49.217 --> 34:52.394
- â™ª You said I live
for tragedy â™ª

34:52.438 --> 34:53.961
- Don't hurt her!

34:54.004 --> 34:58.270
- â™ª So I threw the keys
at your head â™ª

34:58.313 --> 35:00.707
- Mrs. Boland, are you decent?

35:03.797 --> 35:06.930
Mrs. Boland, we're gonna
need you to come out now.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.293
- You have to open
the door, Mrs. Boland.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
Or we'll open it for you.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.387
- I'm going to come out.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.215
I need to know that
I'm not going to be hurt.

35:30.258 --> 35:33.435
- No one's going to hurt you.
- Or my staff.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.177
Nate has a heart condition.
- Nate's fine.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.878
All right, Mrs. Boland.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.448
Time's up.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.424
- Hello, James.

36:05.467 --> 36:08.035
Wow, you brought
the whole team.

36:08.078 --> 36:11.038
Oh, if any of you
are in the market,

36:11.081 --> 36:13.954
we do give special discounts
to government employees.

36:13.997 --> 36:16.913
- I think you'll be
shut down for a while.

36:22.963 --> 36:26.227
- Take all the time you need.

37:00.522 --> 37:05.092
- What's this?
- Shirt, pants, underwear.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.529
I'm good.
- No, you're not.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.270
You're going to get up,

37:09.314 --> 37:12.099
you're going to hose off
that self-pity and depression,

37:12.142 --> 37:13.274
because I'm tired
of looking at it.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.885
- Oh, is that so?
- It is.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.191
And once it starts
swirling down the drain,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.932
you're going to get dressed.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.413
You're going to shave off
that nasty-ass face fungus,

37:21.456 --> 37:24.285
and we're going to go out
and celebrate, do it up right.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.244
- What's there
to celebrate, Ruby?

37:26.287 --> 37:30.813
- You getting a proper lawyer.
- What are you talking about?

37:30.857 --> 37:33.076
- You're not
going away for this.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.124
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going to take care of it.

37:37.167 --> 37:40.954
- How?
- I got you, boo.

37:40.997 --> 37:44.262
Now please, wash your ass.

38:05.370 --> 38:09.461
- Drink up, baby.
- Oh, thanks for mine.

38:09.504 --> 38:13.334
- She's had a day.
- Haven't we all?

38:13.378 --> 38:16.163
- God, it was really--
- Terrifying, I'm sure.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.817
- You would have had to
change my diaper.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.950
- But it was almost--
- I bet Deansie lost it.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.127
- Fun.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.349
It was fun.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.531
- Here's a question.
- Yeah?

38:36.575 --> 38:39.317
- How did they even know
about the pills?

38:42.232 --> 38:46.280
- Or exactly
where to look for them.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.978
- And just for the record--
- You don't have to go there.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.372
- I didn't say a word.
- No one's accusing you.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.897
- But I mean,
someone said something.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.377
- Hey, have you seen Noah?

38:56.421 --> 38:58.205
- He didn't
come in yesterday.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.860
- Why not?

39:00.903 --> 39:02.949
- Oh, nasty stuff's
going around.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.951
You know, last week,
I had conjunctivitis.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.996
You probably know it
as pink eye.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.911
It's super contagious.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.044
I didn't want to
miss work, though.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.046
You probably didn't notice,
but that's why

39:13.089 --> 39:14.917
I was wearing those shades.
They're new.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.138
I found them in
the parking lot.

39:18.181 --> 39:20.227
Don't tell Noah, though.
Because, um...

39:24.362 --> 39:28.017
- â™ª There must be something
else to do â™ª

39:28.061 --> 39:30.977
I didn't want to show anybody,
because it's real nasty.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.152
You ever had it?

39:39.072 --> 39:43.990
- Hey, take a look at this.
What do you think?

39:46.471 --> 39:49.909
I'll be done in
about five minutes.

39:59.309 --> 40:04.445
- Sometimes I think maybe
I don't want to get better.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.013
Because at least if I use,
I know who I am.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.278
I feel like myself.

40:11.321 --> 40:14.324
- Anyone else want to share?

40:29.514 --> 40:32.081
- â™ª There must be something
else to do â™ª

40:34.257 --> 40:39.045
â™ª There must be something
we can do â™ª

41:00.545 --> 41:02.503
- Lot's clean.

41:02.547 --> 41:05.375
- They knew we were coming.
