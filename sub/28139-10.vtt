WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:06.267
- Previously, on "Good Girls."

00:06.310 --> 00:08.443
- He left me,
and he took my kids.

00:08.486 --> 00:10.445
What do you want?
- I want you done.

00:10.488 --> 00:12.099
I want my family safe.

00:12.142 --> 00:13.491
- How's it going
with the sister?

00:13.535 --> 00:15.580
- I'm out of the friend zone.
- Already?

00:15.624 --> 00:17.582
- Do you, like, live here now?

00:17.626 --> 00:19.149
Because you're here,
like, a lot.

00:19.193 --> 00:21.499
I'm a D-bag, so I know
when I see one.

00:21.543 --> 00:23.545
- Well, I stole
from my last job.

00:23.588 --> 00:26.200
- What did you steal?
- Money. Lots of it.

00:26.243 --> 00:29.681
- We are so much more alike
that you could ever know.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.553
- Feds, they opened up an IA
deal or whatever.

00:31.596 --> 00:33.337
- I literally have no idea
what you're saying.

00:33.381 --> 00:35.383
- Internal Affairs, okay?
They investigate dirty cops.

00:35.426 --> 00:38.081
- Did you remove a pen cap
from the evidence locker?

00:38.125 --> 00:39.517
- I failed.
- Like, inconclusive?

00:39.561 --> 00:41.215
- Capital F, failed.

00:41.258 --> 00:42.651
- Did he do
what they said he did?

00:42.694 --> 00:44.696
- Yes.
- Then he should stay in jail.

00:44.740 --> 00:47.264
- It's over. They got me.
I'm out on leave.

00:49.353 --> 00:51.268
- I'm done.
- Is that right?

00:51.312 --> 00:54.184
- No more cash. No more pills.
It's over.

00:54.228 --> 00:56.534
- Which part?
- All of it.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.493
Bring the children home, okay?

01:03.802 --> 01:07.719
It's cost me everything
at this point.

01:07.763 --> 01:10.635
But my...

01:10.679 --> 01:15.510
rock bottom or whatever, um...

01:15.553 --> 01:18.295
was when I lost my family.

01:51.154 --> 01:54.418
- The thing is, you have
no idea how far you've fallen

01:54.462 --> 01:56.246
until you get some distance.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.383
I've had cops in my kitchen.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.645
I've...

02:07.170 --> 02:09.607
Taken my kids to a crack house.

02:16.484 --> 02:21.315
I've lied. I've cheated.
I've stolen.

02:30.933 --> 02:33.675
I've had a gun to my head
so many times

02:33.718 --> 02:35.677
that it doesn't even
scare me anymore.

02:38.810 --> 02:42.510
A full clip adds a pound.

02:42.553 --> 02:45.817
It's like...

02:45.861 --> 02:47.819
why do I know that?

02:47.863 --> 02:50.648
I shouldn't know that.

03:09.014 --> 03:14.324
♪ Oh, Lord, I've lost it now

03:32.473 --> 03:34.910
- I just have to stop.

03:37.042 --> 03:40.872
I want to be normal.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.578
And I can't lose my kids again.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.718
My name is Beth.

04:00.762 --> 04:03.460
And I am an addict.

04:03.504 --> 04:05.332
all: Hi, Beth.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.857
- I'm going to need one of
you here and one of you here,

04:08.900 --> 04:14.863
and I'll hold down the middle
over here with the goodies.

04:14.906 --> 04:16.430
Who's on masks?

04:16.473 --> 04:18.388
- Uh, how about a big leaf?

04:18.432 --> 04:20.869
- Or a fluffy turkey?
- Ooh, Indian headdress.

04:20.912 --> 04:23.263
- Not cool,
- Why not?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.569
- It's cultural appropriation.

04:25.613 --> 04:27.049
both: Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

04:27.092 --> 04:28.659
- Why don't we
avoid any land mines

04:28.703 --> 04:29.921
and just keep this fall themed?

04:29.965 --> 04:32.446
- Oh, thank God you're back.
- Right?

04:32.489 --> 04:33.969
- Where's our homegirl been?

04:34.012 --> 04:35.797
- Life got a little crazy
for a second.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.712
- All I got to say
is Carol filled in for you.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.888
- Oh, do not.
- She didn't want to do themes.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.369
- For the parties?
- It was nuts.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.023
- Oh, speaking of which.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.723
Okay, so we have
acorn thumbprints,

04:48.766 --> 04:49.898
and see, the Hershey kiss
is the little acorn.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.291
- Oh, that's so cute.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.467
- And we got turkey cake pops.

04:53.510 --> 04:55.077
We've got little squirrely
sweet treats,

04:55.120 --> 04:56.296
and I cannot with
this pretzel tail.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.775
- Stop!
- Beth!

04:57.819 --> 04:58.907
- Can you even?

04:58.950 --> 04:59.908
And then, we've got

04:59.951 --> 05:01.605
Gobble Gobble Maple Crumble.

05:01.649 --> 05:02.867
- Oh, wait.
- Uh--

05:02.911 --> 05:04.782
- What?
- Um, those look like

05:04.826 --> 05:06.958
walnuts on top.
- So?

05:07.002 --> 05:10.353
- Oh, walnuts are nuts.
- Well, they're not peanuts.

05:10.397 --> 05:12.355
- Nut family.
- Well, who in

05:12.399 --> 05:13.661
our class is allergic?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.621
- Uh, Cooper doesn't like them.
- Right.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.016
- Well, that's not an allergy.
And you know what else?

05:23.584 --> 05:26.064
All of this...

05:26.108 --> 05:29.590
filled with gluten.
- Oh, my God.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.896
- I mean, where are the
gluten issues in Africa?

05:31.940 --> 05:36.423
Or Brazil?
Or anywhere except for here?

05:36.466 --> 05:39.556
Right?
- Oh, you're bad.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.993
- What happened to you?

05:42.037 --> 05:43.560
- I like it.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.736
- Let's live a little.
-  Okay!

05:45.780 --> 05:47.912
- Annie Marks,
please report to produce.

05:49.958 --> 05:52.656
- We can never
sell this lettuce.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.832
- Hey, question.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.574
- What do you think is worse?
The sex or the pesticides?

05:57.618 --> 06:01.796
- Um, does our insurance
cover puberty blockers?

06:03.188 --> 06:05.365
I think that ship has sailed.
- Has it?

06:05.408 --> 06:06.540
- Yeah, honey,
you're a woman now.

06:06.583 --> 06:08.716
- Mm, it's for my kid.

06:08.759 --> 06:11.153
It's kind of, like the next
step, and he's really stoked.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.503
- Uh-huh.
- So, you know.

06:13.547 --> 06:17.159
- Look, well, I'll check,
but we are Fine and Frugal.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.682
- Mm-hmm.
- Emphasis on the "frugal."

06:18.726 --> 06:20.945
- Mm, right.
- Yeah.

06:20.989 --> 06:23.383
- But you know,
I could pick up extra shifts

06:23.426 --> 06:26.516
or I could--you know,
I'd mop the butcher floor

06:26.560 --> 06:29.432
or unclog toilets, or--
you know, whatever.

06:29.476 --> 06:30.694
I'm just saying,
something to think about.

06:30.738 --> 06:32.435
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.526
- Well, come on,
I'm still down.

06:36.570 --> 06:41.618
- Yeah, blood, bathrooms,
your child's trans journey--

06:41.662 --> 06:44.491
it's, uh--
- It's a lot of imagery.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.537
- Yeah.

06:47.581 --> 06:49.800
I can--I can look
at the schedule.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.150
- Thanks, boss.
- Okay?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.676
Uh--

07:01.638 --> 07:03.771
Hey, uh...

07:03.814 --> 07:07.862
what about your
extracurriculars?

07:07.905 --> 07:11.431
- Oh.
Those are over.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.563
- Huh. Why?

07:13.607 --> 07:18.438
- It's--it's, like,
a whole thing with my sister.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.091
- That sucks.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.833
How bad do you need the money?

07:33.801 --> 07:35.629
Kale.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.457
- Hmm.

07:44.855 --> 07:47.597
- Guilty?
- That's what he wants.

07:47.641 --> 07:49.730
- Why?

07:49.773 --> 07:51.209
- I'm--I'm just another file
in his stack, Ruby.

07:51.253 --> 07:52.776
I mean, you should
see this guy.

07:52.820 --> 07:55.039
He'd rather go play
racquetball or golf.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.128
- The court-appointed ones
can't afford golf.

07:57.172 --> 07:58.652
- Well, that's what it is.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.218
- Then we'll get you
a real lawyer.

08:00.262 --> 08:02.525
- You know how much that costs?

08:02.569 --> 08:05.615
- Stan, you're not
pleading guilty.

08:05.659 --> 08:07.269
- Babe, do you want to eat
or keep the lights on?

08:07.312 --> 08:08.966
Because that's where
we are this month.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.577
Okay, I got no paycheck
coming in.

08:10.620 --> 08:11.926
I can't even get my old job
back at the mall

08:11.969 --> 08:14.798
because they think
I'm a fel--

08:14.842 --> 08:17.497
That better not be a phone.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.803
Hey, you got your ears on,
Journey Scout?

08:21.239 --> 08:24.112
- Excuse you, miss.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.983
Your father is speaking to you.

08:26.027 --> 08:27.637
- Hey.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.291
No phones
during homework, baby.

08:29.334 --> 08:32.599
- And no pop after dinner.
-  Oh, my bad.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.560
I didn't think we still
followed rules around here.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.999
- Oh, you're gonna have
your hands full.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.697
- What are you talking about?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.917
- When I go away.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.838
- It's cheating.
- It's fine.

08:54.882 --> 08:59.060
- It's an affair.
- Oh, come on.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.584
- What do you call it?

09:01.628 --> 09:04.892
- It's maybe
an emotional affair,

09:04.935 --> 09:06.241
which is, like,
barely even a thing.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.243
- Hoda says that's worse.
- Oh.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.854
You know, we're doing Beth
a favor.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.726
- How's that?

09:12.769 --> 09:14.945
- You don't take
an alcoholic to a bar.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.777
- How's this even
going to work?

09:20.821 --> 09:22.692
- We just keep
the trains running.

09:22.736 --> 09:24.564
- Without the dealership?

09:24.607 --> 09:27.305
- Well, I'm kicking around
some ideas.

09:29.786 --> 09:33.007
- You are?
- I am.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.835
- Well, as long
as it doesn't involve

09:34.878 --> 09:40.710
shoving anything up our--
- Sara needs her badges, right?

09:40.754 --> 09:43.670
- Oh, hell, no!
- Okay, will you just chill?

09:43.713 --> 09:45.846
- I'm not going to let you
shove things up my child's--

09:45.889 --> 09:48.762
- Bus!
- What?

09:48.805 --> 09:50.067
- Customs is never
going to search

09:50.111 --> 09:51.634
a bus full of Journey Scouts.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.375
I mean, they're
practically nuns.

09:55.725 --> 09:56.987
- Jesus.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.295
- Oh, I'm sorry,
what was your idea again?

10:00.338 --> 10:02.253
Because I'm open.
- I don't know.

10:02.297 --> 10:04.778
- Mm, shocking.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.216
- That was Beth's thing.

10:12.960 --> 10:15.919
- Or...

10:15.963 --> 10:17.094
- Or?

10:17.138 --> 10:20.881
- Or we locate
a travelling circus

10:20.924 --> 10:23.318
and we find the elephants
or whatever

10:23.361 --> 10:24.928
the largest mammals are
we can find

10:24.972 --> 10:26.713
and we cram the pills
up one of their--

10:26.756 --> 10:27.931
- Hey, ladies.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.287
So how are we
going to do this?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.775
- So it's about a dead girl?

10:45.819 --> 10:48.169
- No, she gets in an accident,
and when she wakes up,

10:48.212 --> 10:51.520
she has no memory and she has
to sort of start her life over.

10:51.563 --> 10:53.696
- So it's a medical
mystery thing?

10:53.740 --> 10:57.395
- More like she has to sort of
figure out who she wants to be.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.136
- Do you actually
see the accident?

10:59.180 --> 11:01.051
Because I am not
good with blood.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.314
- Mm, probably
can't see anything

11:03.358 --> 11:04.707
because it's a book.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.491
- Oh, thank you, professor.

11:06.535 --> 11:08.450
- Hey, is it on Netflix?

11:08.493 --> 11:10.800
- Hey, you guys wash up.
We're going to eat.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.376
- So you're totally okay
with all this?

11:21.419 --> 11:23.639
- What?

11:23.683 --> 11:27.295
- You know...actual book club?

11:31.081 --> 11:33.562
- I mean...

11:33.605 --> 11:35.564
what about you guys?

11:35.607 --> 11:40.612
- Well, kind of miss the money.
- Not going to lie.

11:40.656 --> 11:45.530
- Yeah, how's Stan's lawyer?
- Super. Real shark.

11:45.574 --> 11:47.228
- Well, maybe when
the dealership

11:47.271 --> 11:49.099
gets back on its feet,
I could pitch in and--

11:49.143 --> 11:52.233
- Hey, we'll get by.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.809
- How do you think
he's going to do it?

12:05.681 --> 12:07.683
Without us?
- Oh, I don't know.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.293
There's always some idiot

12:09.337 --> 12:12.340
willing to do
something stupid for money.

12:12.383 --> 12:16.300
- So, do you guys want to
come to book club or not?

12:16.344 --> 12:21.871
- Ooh, gee, we would but...

12:21.915 --> 12:26.789
we kind of have, like, a thing.
- Oh.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.879
- Otherwise,
I would totally love

12:29.923 --> 12:33.491
to pretend to have read it.

12:45.852 --> 12:50.160
- All right, you guys.
Come and get it.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.640
- You want your service badge
or not?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.381
- Why do we have to
go to Canada?

12:53.424 --> 12:55.905
- Because that's where
the nursing home is.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.820
- Can't we visit one here?

12:57.864 --> 13:00.170
- Old people
are lonelier there.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.346
- Because of
socialized medicine?

13:02.390 --> 13:04.740
- Yeah.
- Wait, that makes no sense.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
- Okay, you know what?
Bed time.

13:06.829 --> 13:10.398
Daddy will be in for prayers.
- No thanks.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.140

- Back on the bus in ten.
- Stick with your buddies.

28:48.378 --> 28:52.295
That goes for you, too, Karen.

28:52.339 --> 28:53.993
- I panicked, okay?
- No.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.908
- I couldn't do it.
- No, no, no, no, no!

28:55.951 --> 28:58.345
- We're supposed to be making
them better people, not this.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.478
- What did you do with them?
- In the garbage at the place.

29:01.522 --> 29:05.613
- Oh, my God, you left
our payday in a trash can?

29:05.656 --> 29:07.963
- We could have gotten caught.
- But we didn't.

29:08.007 --> 29:09.486
- With a bunch of drugs
in front of Sara.

29:09.530 --> 29:11.575
- It was the perfect plan.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.361
You know if Beth
had suggested this,

29:14.404 --> 29:15.492
you would have been all in.

29:15.536 --> 29:17.146
- Like I'm some kind
of yes-man?

29:17.190 --> 29:19.192
- "Hey, Ruby, want to rob
a grocery store?"

29:19.235 --> 29:20.976
"Sure, Beth."
"Hey, Ruby.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.587
Want to drink some gasoline?"
"Yeah, sounds yum, Beth.

29:23.631 --> 29:25.459
Pour it in my mouth."
- Okay, you know what--

29:25.502 --> 29:28.854
- But of course, when I come up
with a sound solution--

29:28.897 --> 29:31.378
- Oh, you mean this
or up an elephant ass?

29:31.421 --> 29:34.207
- Yes, I put two viable options
on the table,

29:34.250 --> 29:36.209
and all you had to do
was choose one.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.907
- You know what?
You're right.

29:38.951 --> 29:42.389
You're not Beth.
You never will be.

29:42.432 --> 29:43.912
You know what you are?
- Please.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.001
- You're a child.
You do whatever you want

29:46.045 --> 29:47.437
whenever you want.
- I take risks, Ruby.

29:47.481 --> 29:50.223
- Without thinking about
anyone else but yourself.

29:50.266 --> 29:53.574
- Just because I didn't choose
some safe-ass,

29:53.617 --> 29:55.315
boring-ass life
like my sister--

29:55.358 --> 29:58.971
- You know why she did that?
Because she had to.

29:59.014 --> 30:02.931
She didn't have anyone to
clean up after her like you do.

30:05.281 --> 30:06.892
- That's not true.
- She has been

30:06.935 --> 30:10.460
mopping up your messes
since the day I met you.

30:10.504 --> 30:12.245
- I'm really glad that I can be

30:12.288 --> 30:15.988
such a convenient excuse
for everyone.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.903
- What does that even mean?

30:17.946 --> 30:20.253
- Well, now when Stan
goes to jail,

30:20.296 --> 30:23.082
you'll have someone else
to blame.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.301
- Anyone want dibs
on a Slim Jim?

30:25.345 --> 30:27.216
The machine gave me two.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.185
- You sang songs
and braided hair?

30:39.228 --> 30:41.448
- Ugh, it's, like,
a troop thing.

30:41.491 --> 30:43.624
- That's terrifying.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.757
- ♪ This is the song
that never ends ♪

30:46.801 --> 30:49.151
- Stop.

- Okay, okay.

31:01.555 --> 31:05.341
- You like-y?
- Why?

31:05.385 --> 31:08.692
- Well, I mean, you needed
new ones anyway.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.781
- They look expensive.

31:10.825 --> 31:13.480
- Nah, they came
in a three-pack.

31:13.523 --> 31:15.569
- They're dope.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.356
- The, um...

31:24.317 --> 31:26.754
The medicine
might have to wait.

31:30.366 --> 31:31.672
It's just--
it costs so much more

31:31.715 --> 31:34.370
than I have right now,
you know?

31:34.414 --> 31:36.720
- Okay.

31:36.764 --> 31:38.287
- I'm sorry.

31:40.376 --> 31:42.161
- I'm going to get something
to drink.

31:42.204 --> 31:44.728
- Hey, um...

31:44.772 --> 31:47.296
am I a mess?

31:49.516 --> 31:54.434
I just mean, like,
relative to the other moms.

31:57.567 --> 32:00.179
- Medium.

32:00.222 --> 32:01.571
- Seriously?

32:03.269 --> 32:05.140
Here's the thing:
most private school kids

32:05.184 --> 32:06.533
think their parents
are perfect.

32:06.576 --> 32:08.274
They're going to be
majorly freaked out

32:08.317 --> 32:09.623
when they realize they're not.

32:09.666 --> 32:11.451
- Hm.

32:11.494 --> 32:14.193
- But with you, I already
know what I'm dealing with.

32:14.236 --> 32:16.717
So I'm, like, not that damaged.

32:20.199 --> 32:21.765
- Thanks.

32:25.769 --> 32:29.295
- Want anything to drink?
- I'm okay.

32:59.716 --> 33:02.284
- That bad, huh?

33:07.637 --> 33:10.727
So they suck your soul out yet
or what?

33:10.771 --> 33:12.642
- What are you doing here?

33:12.686 --> 33:15.689
- I tried calling.
- I blocked your number.

33:17.691 --> 33:20.433
Damn, that's cold.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.435
- I'm sure you'll get over it.

33:22.478 --> 33:23.740
- I just wanted to make sure

33:23.784 --> 33:26.308
you were in the loop
about stuff.

33:26.352 --> 33:29.790
- Well don't, okay?

33:29.833 --> 33:32.140
- Okay.

33:32.184 --> 33:34.534
So you're all good, then?

33:34.577 --> 33:36.405
- I'm good.

33:36.449 --> 33:39.539
I'm great.

33:39.582 --> 33:41.323
- All right, then, yeah.

33:41.367 --> 33:45.588
You don't--you don't got
to know about this, then.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.551
- Know what?

33:55.511 --> 33:57.209
What?

34:02.388 --> 34:03.867
Where are they?
- What?

34:03.911 --> 34:05.478
- The books, Dean.
They're not in the cabinet.

34:05.521 --> 34:07.393
- What's going on?
- Where are the books?

34:07.436 --> 34:08.785
- Uh, they're--
they're in accounting.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.310
- Not those books.
The book club books.

need you to come out now.

35:18.028 --> 35:21.293
- You have to open
the door, Mrs. Boland.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.166
Or we'll open it for you.

35:25.210 --> 35:28.387
- I'm going to come out.

35:28.430 --> 35:30.215
I need to know that
I'm not going to be hurt.

35:30.258 --> 35:33.435
- No one's going to hurt you.
- Or my staff.

35:33.479 --> 35:36.177
Nate has a heart condition.
- Nate's fine.

35:39.746 --> 35:41.878
All right, Mrs. Boland.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.448
Time's up.

36:02.421 --> 36:05.424
- Hello, James.

36:05.467 --> 36:08.035
Wow, you brought
the whole team.

36:08.078 --> 36:11.038
Oh, if any of you
are in the market,

36:11.081 --> 36:13.954
we do give special discounts
to government employees.

36:13.997 --> 36:16.913
- I think you'll be
shut down for a while.

36:22.963 --> 36:26.227
- Take all the time you need.

37:00.522 --> 37:05.092
- What's this?
- Shirt, pants, underwear.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.529
I'm good.
- No, you're not.

37:07.573 --> 37:09.270
You're going to get up,

37:09.314 --> 37:12.099
you're going to hose off
that self-pity and depression,

37:12.142 --> 37:13.274
because I'm tired
of looking at it.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.885
- Oh, is that so?
- It is.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.191
And once it starts
swirling down the drain,

37:17.235 --> 37:18.932
you're going to get dressed.

37:18.975 --> 37:21.413
You're going to shave off
that nasty-ass face fungus,

37:21.456 --> 37:24.285
and we're going to go out
and celebrate, do it up right.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.244
- What's there
to celebrate, Ruby?

37:26.287 --> 37:30.813
- You getting a proper lawyer.
- What are you talking about?

37:30.857 --> 37:33.076
- You're not
going away for this.

37:33.120 --> 37:37.124
- What are you talking about?
- I'm going to take care of it.

37:37.167 --> 37:40.954
- How?
- I got you, boo.

37:40.997 --> 37:44.262
Now please, wash your ass.

38:05.370 --> 38:09.461
- Drink up, baby.
- Oh, thanks for mine.

38:09.504 --> 38:13.334
- She's had a day.
- Haven't we all?

38:13.378 --> 38:16.163
- God, it was really--
- Terrifying, I'm sure.

38:16.206 --> 38:17.817
- You would have had to
change my diaper.

38:17.860 --> 38:20.950
- But it was almost--
- I bet Deansie lost it.

38:22.561 --> 38:24.127
- Fun.

38:25.912 --> 38:28.349
It was fun.

38:33.876 --> 38:36.531
- Here's a question.
- Yeah?

38:36.575 --> 38:39.317
- How did they even know
about the pills?

38:42.232 --> 38:46.280
- Or exactly
where to look for them.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.978
- And just for the record--
- You don't have to go there.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.372
- I didn't say a word.
- No one's accusing you.

38:51.416 --> 38:54.897
- But I mean,
someone said something.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.377
- Hey, have you seen Noah?

38:56.421 --> 38:58.205
- He didn't
come in yesterday.

38:58.248 --> 39:00.860
- Why not?

39:00.903 --> 39:02.949
- Oh, nasty stuff's
going around.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.951
You know, last week,
I had conjunctivitis.

39:04.994 --> 39:06.996
You probably know it
as pink eye.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.911
It's super contagious.

39:08.955 --> 39:11.044
I didn't want to
miss work, though.

39:11.087 --> 39:13.046
You probably didn't notice,
but that's why

39:13.089 --> 39:14.917
I was wearing those shades.
They're new.

39:14.961 --> 39:18.138
I found them in
the parking lot.

39:18.181 --> 39:20.227
Don't tell Noah, though.

39:46.471 --> 39:49.909
I'll be done in
about five minutes.

39:59.309 --> 40:04.445
- Sometimes I think maybe
I don't want to get better.

40:04.489 --> 40:07.013
Because at least if I use,
I know who I am.

40:09.102 --> 40:11.278
