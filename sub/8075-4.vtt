WEBVTT

00:08.209 --> 00:09.510
Man.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.079
The hospital wants us to fill
out a lot more these forms

00:11.112 --> 00:12.480
than when DJ was born.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.847
I know.

00:13.881 --> 00:17.218
We're just having a baby, it's
not like we're buying a car.

00:17.251 --> 00:19.387
Maybe we should do
this later, honey.

00:19.420 --> 00:21.489
No, there is no later, Dan.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.291
I'm due in a week.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.959
I can't believe how fast
this pregnancy went by.

00:25.993 --> 00:28.696
You're kidding, right?

00:28.729 --> 00:30.198
No, I'm not kidding.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.500
Do you realize that this could
be our last weekend of freedom

00:32.533 --> 00:33.834
before the baby gets here?

00:33.867 --> 00:35.769
I mean, god, we gotta go out
and do something, you know.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.605
Here it is, it's
Saturday night, we

00:37.638 --> 00:39.473
got to go do something tonight.

00:39.507 --> 00:40.508
Hello losers.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.113
I know what you're thinking.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.615
Can she possibly own
Boardwalk and Park

00:47.648 --> 00:49.817
Place three weeks in a row?

00:49.850 --> 00:52.886
Oh yes she can.

00:52.920 --> 00:54.655
Oh yes she will.

00:57.425 --> 01:02.196
Well, if there's a lonely,
pathetic, yet bizarrely chipper

01:02.230 --> 01:04.265
woman standing in our
kitchen with a Monopoly game,

01:04.298 --> 01:07.101
it must be Saturday night.

01:07.135 --> 01:08.469
Maybe that's how
life looks when you're

01:08.502 --> 01:11.639
stuck on Baltic Avenue, but
up on the green properties,

01:11.672 --> 01:14.842
life is sweet.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.111
I thought you were giving
Fred the baby on the weekend

01:17.145 --> 01:19.680
so you could have a social life.

01:19.713 --> 01:20.848
You guys are my social life.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.020
I can't go out tonight.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.289
I'm feeling all crampy.

01:31.692 --> 01:32.793
Tough.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.529
We're going out tonight,
this is our last hurrah.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.997
We're going to go out
to a fancy dinner,

01:37.030 --> 01:39.200
and then we'll sleep
over in a fancy hotel.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.270
One where the ice
machine's indoors.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.704
Wait, we'll have
plenty of time

01:43.737 --> 01:45.973
to do things once
the baby comes.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.108
No, we're doing it, and you're
wearing your good suit, too.

01:48.142 --> 01:48.942
It's in the dryer.

01:54.081 --> 01:54.882
Jackie.

01:57.985 --> 01:58.786
You heard.

02:02.423 --> 02:06.194
I laid out your
money and everything.

02:06.227 --> 02:08.061
Well, this might
be our last chance.

02:08.095 --> 02:10.164
I mean, you understand
that now, don't you?

02:10.198 --> 02:13.634
I'll give you
each an extra $500.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.370
That's a damn
good deal, honey.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.806
No, Dan, we are going out.

02:18.839 --> 02:22.176
You know, we've got at least a
year of baby jail ahead of us,

02:22.210 --> 02:24.445
and that kind of time
really changes a person.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.279
Look at her.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.384
I rest my case.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.522
JACKIE: DJ.

02:34.555 --> 02:38.259
Deej, my favorite
nephew, what do you say?

02:38.292 --> 02:40.828
It looks like just you and
me tonight, huh, Monopoly?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.129
Monopoly!

02:42.162 --> 02:44.765
Aunt Jackie, it's Saturday
night, I'm going to the movies.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.734
Great, we'll catch a movie.

02:46.767 --> 02:47.635
I'm going with my friends.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.275
All right, you can
drive me to the movies.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.143
But you have to wait in
the car till it's over.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.948
Then you can drive me
to the ice cream place,

03:00.981 --> 03:02.149
but you have to wait
in the car there.

03:04.918 --> 03:07.888
Then you can bring me home.

03:07.921 --> 03:10.291
All right!

03:10.324 --> 03:14.027
Sorry, Roseanne, can't
play Monopoly, I got plans!

03:14.061 --> 03:24.104
[theme music]

03:24.104 --> 03:34.114
[theme music]

04:02.310 --> 04:03.844
DARLENE: Come on, Becky,
let's get out of here.

04:03.877 --> 04:05.979
I'm starting to smell
like this place.

04:06.013 --> 04:09.149
I gotta at least make
it look like I cleaned up.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.851
Just write a note
that says "I cleaned up"

04:10.884 --> 04:13.921
and put it on that pile of crap.

04:13.954 --> 04:17.925
Hey, check it out.

04:17.958 --> 04:22.563
There's a bottle of peppermint
schnapps with a card from mom.

04:22.596 --> 04:26.199
"Dear Leon, congratulations
on five years of sobriety."

04:31.772 --> 04:36.176
That is the meanest
thing I've ever seen.

04:36.209 --> 04:39.380
Man, she's good.

04:39.413 --> 04:41.048
You ever had this stuff?

04:41.081 --> 04:42.916
Peppermint schnapps--

04:42.950 --> 04:44.752
I don't think so.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.755
Huh, what are the
odds, it's open.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.457
Darlene.

04:49.490 --> 04:52.660
Oh, relax, we're
saving a man's life here.

04:52.693 --> 04:56.630
Besides-- I mean, you got
anything better to do?

04:56.664 --> 04:57.998
Well--

04:58.031 --> 05:00.834
Before you answer, remember,
it's Lanford, and it's 8:30.

05:00.868 --> 05:01.669
We're the only ones up.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.443
Not bad.

05:09.477 --> 05:12.145
Kind of like a candy cane.
- Yep.

05:12.179 --> 05:13.547
Every burp is Christmas morning.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.628
Roseanne!

05:27.661 --> 05:28.729
Good news.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.464
Pulled some strings
with a maire d',

05:30.498 --> 05:34.067
we only we have another
hour wait for a table.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.603
Oh well, that's
all right, Dan.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.305
There's plenty to
do in this hotel.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.541
Hey, look it here.

05:40.574 --> 05:43.043
Welcome to Josh
Meyer's bar mitzvah.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.582
Wow.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.684
Jewish people in
their natural habitat.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.322
I'm starving.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.124
What do you say we grab
a bite at the coffee shop

05:57.157 --> 06:00.561
and go back up to that
room I paid $95 for.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.764
That's four times more than
I paid for this Robert Hall.

06:03.797 --> 06:05.733
Hey, hey, hey.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.900
Who are those for?

06:06.934 --> 06:08.301
They're for the
Meyer bar mitzvah.

06:08.335 --> 06:09.269
Oh.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.103
Well, that's us.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.446
Dinner is starting
in five or 10 minutes.

06:18.479 --> 06:20.347
No way, Roseanne.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.348
Come, on Dan.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.217
Grab a yamulke,
we're going in there.

06:24.251 --> 06:27.120
Today, you are a Meyer.

06:27.154 --> 06:29.457
Wait a minute, honey.

06:29.490 --> 06:30.524
It looks a little dressy.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.986
Don't look conspicuous,
just follow my lead.

06:59.019 --> 06:59.820
Shalom.

07:02.590 --> 07:03.957
Shalom.

07:03.991 --> 07:04.858
Shalom.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.460
Shalom.

07:06.494 --> 07:08.095
Shalom.

07:08.128 --> 07:08.996
Shalom.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.832
You don't have to bow.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.701
So what're we
supposed to do now?

07:13.734 --> 07:16.670
We'll just mingle, OK, and
if we see a drunk kid walking

07:16.704 --> 07:18.171
around with checks
hanging out of his pocket,

07:18.205 --> 07:22.610
we go up and we
say "mazel toff."

07:22.643 --> 07:24.444
RABBI FARKAS: Hi,
I'm Rabbi Farkas.

07:24.478 --> 07:25.813
How do you know young Josh?

07:25.846 --> 07:30.851
Uh, I'm a friend of a friend
of a friend, or his mother.

07:30.884 --> 07:33.521
Oh, well, what Temple
do you belong to?

07:33.554 --> 07:36.824
Temple-- Beth Midler.

07:41.428 --> 07:42.963
Really, I've
never heard of that.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.231
Are you reform?

07:44.264 --> 07:48.035
No, but we're
trying to cut down.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.270
You know, I think
I'm going to wear

07:50.303 --> 07:51.972
this thing with a little
south side slide to it.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.145
Well, we're going to
take a little break now.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.648
We come back, the Meyer
family has requested something

08:00.681 --> 08:02.249
from "Fiddler on the Roof."

08:02.282 --> 08:06.253
So if you had any requests,
please don't hesitate.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.689
ROSEANNE: What about something
from "Jesus Christ Superstar"?

08:12.593 --> 08:14.528
Well, there's
one in every crowd.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.466
Why don't you come up
here, young lady, huh?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.333
Let's give her a hand.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.710
Why don't you give the first
toast this evening, hm?

08:29.743 --> 08:31.779
Oh, OK.

08:31.812 --> 08:34.748
Well, um.

08:34.782 --> 08:39.853
Welcome to the Josh
Meyer bar mitzvah.

08:39.887 --> 08:44.825
And, uh-- of course you
know Josh Meyer, right here.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.226
This is my husband Marvin, here.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.498
He signs everything
I say for the deaf.

08:56.103 --> 09:00.273
WAITER (YELLING):
Dinner is served!

09:00.307 --> 09:02.075
Man, look at them
grab up the food!

09:02.109 --> 09:05.946
Oh, man, these
are our people, Dan.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.447
They do make a
fellow feel at home.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.718
Excuse me, pardon me, my wife's
having a baby, excuse me.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.619
Honey.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.654
Thank you.

09:13.687 --> 09:14.955
What've we got here?

09:14.988 --> 09:18.025
We've got lokshen
kugel, kreplach, knishes,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.927
kasha varnishkes with gravy.

09:19.960 --> 09:23.163
Man, I though they
only liked Chinese good.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.999
Let me have some of that
varnish with gravy, there.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.437
Man, that's delicious.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.605
Good thing I don't
know what it is,

09:31.639 --> 09:32.806
or I probably couldn't eat it.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.242
Yeah, just like at home.

09:35.275 --> 09:38.211
You know, they ate way
better in the Old Testament.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.648
Is it OK if we sit here?

09:40.681 --> 09:42.515
Only if you got cigarettes.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.354
Well, don't you think
it's a little unhealthy

09:47.387 --> 09:48.956
to be smoking at your age?

09:48.989 --> 09:52.893
Aw, shut up!

09:52.926 --> 09:57.831
I been to 306 of these things--

09:57.865 --> 10:00.233
OK, mother,
let's go, let's go.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.435
I'll get you a beautiful
cigar in the gift shop.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.603
Come on, let's go.

10:09.476 --> 10:10.778
Hey.

10:10.811 --> 10:11.945
What do you two
think you're doing?

10:11.979 --> 10:15.215
Oh god, don't
panic, just eat fast.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.884
You're going to go the
whole night without saying

10:16.917 --> 10:20.220
hello to your Uncle Sol?

10:20.253 --> 10:21.588
You're Shlomo, right?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.757
No, I'm not, I just had a
couple drinks up in the room.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.862
He doesn't recognize us.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.964
I can't believe you
don't recognize us, first

10:30.998 --> 10:33.400
no shower gift, and now this?

10:33.433 --> 10:35.235
You think I don't
recognize you?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.070
You think I want to send
this through the mail?

10:37.104 --> 10:38.939
I want to deliver it in person.

10:38.972 --> 10:44.077
I want to give $100 to
the baby for college.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.078
I'm having twins.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.451
She's kidding, Uncle Sol.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.086
You're such a kidder.

10:53.120 --> 10:55.789
She's been a kidder
since she was a baby.

10:55.823 --> 10:58.225
Uh, say, isn't that, um--

10:58.258 --> 10:59.727
Marilyn and Morty?

10:59.760 --> 11:00.894
Yeah, what, do
they think they're

11:00.928 --> 11:02.295
going to go the whole
night without saying

11:02.329 --> 11:04.197
hello to their Uncle Sol?

11:04.231 --> 11:05.532
Say, you two, you
think you're going

11:05.565 --> 11:07.701
to go the whole night without
saying hello to Uncle Sol?

11:07.735 --> 11:09.903
What's the matter with you?

11:09.937 --> 11:14.174
[speaking in yiddish]

11:14.207 --> 11:18.779
He was always
my favorite uncle.

11:18.812 --> 11:19.880
I'm hot.

11:19.913 --> 11:21.381
I'm always hot at these things.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.615
Forget about hot.

11:22.649 --> 11:24.985
I can hardly hear a
thing over that band.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.519
My fork is too short.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.688
Did you get a short fork?

11:28.722 --> 11:31.491
You know, the kugel was awful.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.763
I spit in a napkin and
put it on Larry's plate.

11:35.796 --> 11:38.498
You know, I'm
really hot myself.

11:38.531 --> 11:41.001
Get a load of her Highness.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.269
Total lift.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.404
She had her eyes done, and
that's not her real nose.

11:51.644 --> 11:55.949
Man, these people are
completely rude for no reason.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.585
I love it here!

11:58.618 --> 11:59.486
Hey!

11:59.519 --> 12:00.387
These are free, right?

12:00.420 --> 12:02.022
As many as you want.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.157
I love it here, too.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.625
See?

12:05.658 --> 12:09.196
I got to admit it, honey,
I am having a good time.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.331
And look over there,
it's games for the kids.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.867
It's ski ball!

12:13.901 --> 12:15.936
Make that the best
time of my life.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.244
So what'd you
like better, Becky?

12:24.277 --> 12:26.847
Schnapps in coffee, schnapps
on the cake, or schnapps

12:26.880 --> 12:27.680
over ice cream?

12:29.649 --> 12:30.450
OK.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.555
Man, you are schnapp faced.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.794
What the hell are
you doing back there?

12:40.828 --> 12:42.595
Just a little meat sculpture.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.037
Guess who this is.

12:50.070 --> 12:51.905
(IMITATING ROSEANNE) Darlene!

12:51.939 --> 12:53.340
Becky!

12:53.373 --> 12:57.110
My back's itchy
right in the center!

12:57.144 --> 12:59.446
Oh my god, it's mom.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.513
It's mom tartar.

13:03.416 --> 13:08.555
How long do you think it
would take to cook mom's head?

13:08.588 --> 13:11.324
2 and 1/2 hours at 350.

13:11.358 --> 13:14.661
I've thought about it a lot.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.628
Whoa.

13:15.662 --> 13:17.998
Check out that guy.

13:18.031 --> 13:18.932
Nice!

13:18.966 --> 13:21.268
(SHOUTING) Ow, baby!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.170
Yeah!

13:23.203 --> 13:26.506
Jeez, Becky, put it
back in your pants.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.741
Ah, he didn't even look over.

13:28.775 --> 13:30.543
Well, what's that
about anyway, Becky?

13:30.577 --> 13:34.514
I mean, he was OK looking, but
you've got Mark at home, and--

13:34.547 --> 13:35.448
Mark is--

13:35.482 --> 13:37.617
Mark is what?

13:37.650 --> 13:38.818
Your husband.
Right.

13:38.852 --> 13:39.987
That's where I was
going with that.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.156
Say it, say it, say it.

13:43.190 --> 13:44.624
He's gorgeous, OK.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.625
There, I said it.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.460
Mark is a gorgeous man.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.063
Now hand me a knife, I must
gut myself like a fish.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.735
He is gorgeous, isn't he.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.837
But you know, it's
kind of a trade off.

13:57.871 --> 14:01.274
I mean, he's not exactly the
greatest conversationalist.

14:01.308 --> 14:03.810
Maybe that's
your fault. I mean,

14:03.843 --> 14:05.712
when he speaks you should
try rewarding him with little

14:05.745 --> 14:08.648
treats.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.984
Well he's not that bad.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.053
I mean, you always make
him sound like the dumbest

14:13.086 --> 14:15.122
guy on the planet.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.656
Well, name someone dumber.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.128
Ha, yeah, like I know
everyone on the planet.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.466
Well, look, you know he's not
the brightest guy in the world.

14:26.499 --> 14:31.271
I mean, what's going to happen
with you guys in like 10 years?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.405
What do you mean?

14:32.439 --> 14:34.074
Well, Mark's not going
to be gorgeous forever.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.477
I mean, summer turns into
fall, young Elvis turns

14:37.510 --> 14:39.846
into bloated Elvis.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.350
Well, he's more than
just looks, Darlene.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.953
He's sweet and gentle.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.554
Doesn't run around.

14:47.587 --> 14:52.325
He's perfectly happy spending
quiet evenings at home with me,

14:52.359 --> 14:55.595
and just because we have
nothing in particular

14:55.628 --> 14:59.566
to talk about ever,
doesn't mean we don't

14:59.599 --> 15:00.600
have a wonderful marriage.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.744
Here.
There's no Kleenex.

15:11.778 --> 15:12.579
Thanks.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.085
Well, if you feel this
bad about it, Becky,

15:18.118 --> 15:19.953
you should do something.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.489
I don't know, Mark is Mark.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.357
What can I do?

15:24.391 --> 15:25.925
Renovate him.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.495
I mean, that's what
she did with dad.

15:28.528 --> 15:31.999
He used to have no goals
in a menial job, and--

15:32.032 --> 15:36.369
well, now-- he can bowl 200.

15:36.403 --> 15:37.437
I don't know if I can.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.541
I mean, mom is so
much stronger than me.

15:41.574 --> 15:44.777
Just look at her.

15:44.811 --> 15:45.778
Come on, Becky.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.348
You're as strong as she is.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.583
Wow, this is weird.

15:50.617 --> 15:55.188
You're like-- helping me,
advising me to stay with Mark.

15:55.222 --> 15:57.290
God, we never do this.

15:57.324 --> 16:00.760
We never talk to each
other like people.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.997
Yeah, well, that's mom's
fault. We'd be friends by now

16:04.031 --> 16:05.698
she'd let us start
drinking when we were kids.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.807
So, Josh, you
like the girls yet?

16:14.841 --> 16:16.509
Not really.

16:16.543 --> 16:19.512
Well, you're a man today,
you better get off the pot.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.413
I better get back.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.314
Nice meeting you.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.415
Hey, hey wait, Josh.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.685
Before you go, since
it's your special day,

16:25.718 --> 16:27.020
here, go ahead and
pick a present.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.325
I guess I'll take the pen.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.693
Ah, good choice.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.727
That's from the hotel here.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.099
Yes!

16:39.132 --> 16:41.168
Ice Man for the charity drive.

16:41.201 --> 16:44.704
How about some high fives, guys?

16:44.737 --> 16:46.106
[kids cheer]

16:46.139 --> 16:49.042
They love me!

16:49.076 --> 16:52.645
Kids love anything
that you climb on, Dam.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.747
Sylvia and Murray.

16:54.781 --> 16:56.015
That's us.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.817
No, that's them.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.386
They don't know you, and
the rest of the people

16:59.419 --> 17:02.055
here don't know you, either.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.190
Oh.

17:03.223 --> 17:05.058
I know what this is all
about, it's because I

17:05.092 --> 17:06.726
married a Gentile, isn't it?

17:06.759 --> 17:09.196
You snuck in
there, didn't you?

17:09.229 --> 17:11.464
Yeah, sorry, Uncle Sol.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.234
My brother-in-law
is paying for this.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.368
We're going.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.970
No, you're staying, I
hate my brother-in-law.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.706
Sit, eat, drink.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.808
Take home a center piece.

17:21.841 --> 17:25.878
Hey, all right,
bar mitzvahs rock.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.914
You call this a bar mitzvah?

17:27.947 --> 17:30.517
He spent $20 a head.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.352
At my son's bar mitzvah--

17:32.385 --> 17:33.653
I don't want to tell
you what I spent--

17:33.686 --> 17:36.723
I spent $30 a head.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.826
Who loves their son more?

17:39.859 --> 17:41.794
So, when's the baby due?

17:41.828 --> 17:43.463
Any minute now.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.898
I became a grandfather
about six weeks ago.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.800
The baby's colicky.

17:47.834 --> 17:48.968
Baby won't sleep
through the night,

17:49.001 --> 17:50.770
and half the time the
baby won't even eat.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.839
Oh, man, that's the worst.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.006
Yeah, my daughter
and her husband

17:54.040 --> 17:55.074
are going out of their minds.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.145
Oh, god, I bet they are.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.380
You know, I need another drink.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.018
You know something?

18:06.052 --> 18:08.421
In 20 years they'll
forget they didn't sleep.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.824
The only thing they'll
remember is just this.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.860
This'll be the only
thing that they remember.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.829
Oh, look at that those eyes.
UNCLE SOL: Uh huh.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.731
And that little mouth.

18:18.765 --> 18:19.832
Yeah, the nose
will come later.

18:22.602 --> 18:25.872
Oh, hey, before you put
your wallet away, here.

18:25.905 --> 18:28.275
No, no, no,
that's for the baby.

18:28.308 --> 18:32.312
When Uncle Sol gives a
gift, it stays given.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.848
Well, I always
wanted a rich uncle.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.484
Eh, I'm comfortable.

18:37.517 --> 18:38.618
Yeah?

18:38.651 --> 18:39.519
You married?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.787
I'm a widower.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.622
Actually, twice.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.558
I think I'm a jinx.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.427
Man, I'd love for
you to meet my mom.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.700
Say, I got another nephew
that's going to have a bar

18:53.733 --> 18:55.268
mitzvah in a couple of weeks.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.369
I'll see you there.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.805
You got it.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.273
DAN: Bye, Uncle Sol.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.107
So long, Shlomo.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.345
OK, I am.

19:08.481 --> 19:11.518
I guess we better go soon.

19:11.551 --> 19:12.852
Why?

19:12.885 --> 19:14.954
We were having a good time,
now you're all grumpy again.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.789
They get colicky, Roseanne.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.459
They need to be fed
every 10 minutes.

19:19.492 --> 19:23.463
And burped, and
changed, and fed again.

19:23.496 --> 19:29.269
And burped, and changed,
and fed, and burped.

19:29.302 --> 19:32.439
You were right, honey.

19:32.472 --> 19:35.074
Our days are
definitely numbered.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.444
Thank god you dragged me
out for one last hurrah,

19:37.477 --> 19:41.614
because the next six months
are going to be hell.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.483
They're going to
be fantastic, Dan.

19:43.516 --> 19:44.851
Let's go dance.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.219
I don't get it.

19:46.253 --> 19:48.921
A few hours ago, you were
calling it baby jail.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.557
Oh, yeah, I know, I know.

19:50.590 --> 19:55.228
But, you know, remember the
way they wrap their hand

19:55.262 --> 19:58.298
around your finger, and the
way they look when they smile

19:58.331 --> 20:04.304
the first time, and the way they
smell after they've had a bath.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.373
It's a pretty cool
jail, actually.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.774
Yeah.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.477
The way they pop their little
eyes open for the first time,

20:10.510 --> 20:14.514
and look at you like
they got a bum deal.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.815
That's the coolest.

20:15.848 --> 20:16.716
Yeah.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.286
But I am going to miss this.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.755
Just us, leisurely like.

20:22.789 --> 20:25.492
I mean, it's all going to be
about the baby for awhile.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.959
I'm going to miss you.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.227
Well, we've got tonight.

20:30.863 --> 20:44.844
And we're up $100.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.814
JACKIE: One, two
three, four, chance.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.048
Chance.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.182
Pay luxury tax.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.890
Advance to go.

20:57.924 --> 21:03.463
Oh, I'll collect my 200
simoleons if you don't mind.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.399
Now, why, your
roll, little doggie.

21:06.433 --> 21:10.102
You're coming down
my street, now.

21:10.136 --> 21:11.237
Ooh!

21:11.270 --> 21:15.742
Oh, Boardwalk, with a hotel.

21:15.775 --> 21:18.044
I'm a little short, you
think you can help me out?

21:18.077 --> 21:21.548
Well, I could, but I won't.

21:24.484 --> 21:28.421
Sorry, pooch, it's
a dog-eat-dog world.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.923
She's killing us!

21:30.957 --> 21:32.792
I'm dead.
I am dead.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.194
You have been so lucky.

21:35.227 --> 21:40.733
It's a sad, sad tale of
the lucky and the dead.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.703
Somebody's got to win,
it may as well be me.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.605
Let's go again.
