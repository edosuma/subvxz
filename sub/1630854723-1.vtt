13:38.943 --> 13:40.194
You came two hours early.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.361
What's going on?

13:41.487 --> 13:45.491
I know, but I couldn't hold my horses.
I found it!

13:46.242 --> 13:47.493
You found what?

13:53.958 --> 13:54.958
Wow.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.377
Wow, indeed.

13:56.502 --> 14:01.131
I asked a guy at the Burns & Nobels
bookstore to check in the back,

14:01.340 --> 14:03.175
and there you go.

14:03.425 --> 14:05.261
Last book in the whole bookstore.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.346
I thought they burned it all.

14:07.680 --> 14:11.433
Not all!
Please, can you sign it for me?

14:13.269 --> 14:14.603
Of course.

14:22.486 --> 14:24.280
I wanted to ask you.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.491
Why did you titled it Halloween bills?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.911
Hmm... It's a long story.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.664
Come on, we have time.

14:34.665 --> 14:35.457
Okay.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.167
I see we need to kill two hours.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.502
You are funny.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.089
Kill two hours. Haha, stop it girl.

14:42.506 --> 14:44.466
Okay. So...

14:44.675 --> 14:46.343
after last Halloween,

14:46.510 --> 14:48.512
I was collecting all the bills.

14:48.762 --> 14:50.639
I always decorate our house.

14:50.890 --> 14:54.435
So I bought many fake bones, skulls, legs.

14:54.602 --> 14:58.606
You know, all the parts to make our
house spectacular from the outside.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.984
My final bill was huge.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.862
So I was thinking,

15:05.154 --> 15:08.073
Michael leaves all the bodies
at places where he kills people.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.492
Why can't he just bring them home?

15:10.659 --> 15:14.163
I could some of the dead
body parts as decorations.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.499
No more plastic, cheap, poorly made stuff.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.293
No more bills.

15:19.501 --> 15:24.256
Problem solves.
So I texted him “Bring body home”.

16:07.841 --> 16:10.469
Wow. That was smart, and?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.888
That's it.
That was my inspiration.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.517
That was a pretty quick story actually.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.142
Yeah,

16:18.435 --> 16:21.605
when you have an idea for the book,
the rest is just easier.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.650
All you need is the beginning of the story
and how it should end.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.486
And then you just place
actions and dialogues.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.571
Like in this film.

16:31.615 --> 16:32.615
What film?

16:33.117 --> 16:34.159
Never mind.

16:34.368 --> 16:38.247
Hey, I wanted to ask you. Is she here?

16:38.580 --> 16:39.581
Our guest?

16:39.790 --> 16:40.833
Yup.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.960
Yes, she is in here.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.379
Can I see her?

16:46.505 --> 16:47.505
Sure.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.716
It is her lunch anyway.

16:48.966 --> 16:49.966
But first,

16:50.175 --> 16:52.678
hide the knives,
we don't want to scare her.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.277
How sweet.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.494
Fresh meat.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.663
Welcome to prime time, bitch!

17:19.872 --> 17:24.501
Haha, I will you by pretty
and your little soul too.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.757
Okay, that is enough of these quotes
from your husband's movies.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.425
She needs to eat now.

17:38.849 --> 17:40.309
You know the rules.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.157
Wow, she must be hungry.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.452
Yes, and it is going to take a while.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.664
You want to read some stuff
I wrote for my next book?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.668
Sure.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.396
When I wake up,

18:26.522 --> 18:29.274
I sit and resolve every decision
I am going to make in the day.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.527
What I am going to eat.
What I am going to wear.

18:31.735 --> 18:32.903
How I am going to feel.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.280
If we are honest, I think we all do.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.157
We never surprise ourselves.

18:37.366 --> 18:41.328
I mean you'd have to believe there was a way
your body can do something your mind didn't want.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.414
Or wasn't expecting. I think that is crazy.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.506
We already know
if we are going to skydive or eat octopus.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.423
We already know.

18:53.590 --> 18:58.137
It is just that tipping point of whether or
not we have the courage to say yes.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.848
Or the good sense to say no.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.192
But then again, what do I know?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.237
I am let's say, twenty nine.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.446
I am single.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.533
I don't even own a cat. Is owning slavery?

19:19.783 --> 19:21.493
Are animals slaves?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.030
I suppose we are all slaves.

19:23.162 --> 19:27.207
Slave to our jobs, to society,
to our own fears and desires.

19:27.374 --> 19:31.503
And when you revolt against
even one of those, you lose at life.

19:31.712 --> 19:35.507
You become a twenty nine year old,
with no relationships, no cat,

19:35.674 --> 19:37.801
and a bed that is just
a mattress on the floor.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.807
So why now, this?
It is not like I haven't before.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.684
It is like a bike, right?

19:46.143 --> 19:49.396
Though God help you if you fall off,
it could be painful.

19:49.479 --> 19:51.356
An issue, at the very least.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.664
This is a young person's
game now. Isn't it?

20:07.915 --> 20:09.625
Or maybe that is why I am doing it.

20:09.833 --> 20:11.126
To prove I still can.

20:11.335 --> 20:14.588
To prove I am still in demand,
and can still close a deal.

20:16.590 --> 20:21.428
God, I sound like all those bros making trades and
doing lines of coke from a hookers bleaches asshole.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.890
How do we do this again?

20:25.349 --> 20:26.683
Hi, my name is bla bla.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.478
I am here to bla bla,
your bla, until you bla.

20:29.603 --> 20:32.763
Then I am going to bla and hopefully
I will feel satisfied.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.190
But I won't.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.316
I never do.

20:35.400 --> 20:41.490
I keep trying, over and over again.
This one. This will make me feel important.

20:41.698 --> 20:43.676
Special. No, maybe just alive?

20:45.244 --> 20:46.244
But it won't.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.621
Nothing will.

20:47.829 --> 20:49.748
Or should I say no one thing will.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.852
We need all three masters.
Job. Society. Self.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.296
At best, I have one and a half of those.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.093
Look at me.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.762
Jesus fucking Christ. Just look at me.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.389
I am old.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.516
I am getting old.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.935
Is this even attractive anymore?

21:10.352 --> 21:14.106
My hair is like a lightening storm,
I am too short or too tall?

21:14.314 --> 21:15.899
Who even fucking knows anymore?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.527
Am I even pretty? I don't even know.

21:18.652 --> 21:20.070
I used to be.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.072
But now.

21:27.202 --> 21:29.579
Could I even get a guy to
take me home anymore?

21:29.871 --> 21:33.333
How long will he want to say?
What will he say? Will he be a dick?

21:33.500 --> 21:34.918
I feel like that's probable.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.690
How do I respond to him to him
being a dick, when he inevitably is one?

21:38.714 --> 21:39.714
Just smile?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.717
Act like I agree with him?

21:54.938 --> 21:58.108
And worst than that. What if I like him?

21:58.317 --> 21:59.526
What if he is nice?

21:59.776 --> 22:04.948
What if, he opens my door, pulls out my chair, tells
me I look pretty and listens to what I have to say?

22:05.240 --> 22:07.576
I don't need that kind
of fucking complication.

22:07.784 --> 22:11.455
I don't have the time or
energy to deal with something like that.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.542
When will they finally invent mind control?

22:15.792 --> 22:19.504
You know how everyone always says “hey,
they'd say we would have flying cars by now”.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.798
Well, news flash! They
are called airplanes.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.260
So is mind control really
too much to ask for?

22:25.802 --> 22:26.802
Cleavage.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.848
Cleavage used to do
it. Perfect mind control.

22:30.140 --> 22:34.394
You could tell a guy you were going to chop his head
off and put it in the freezer with thirty other guys,

22:34.561 --> 22:37.105
and he'd just smile and
stare into the canyon.

22:37.397 --> 22:40.859
Now they want a ridiculously
proportioned Jessica Rabbit,

22:41.151 --> 22:43.862
and a butt job on the table by dessert.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.038
Sigh.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.539
Just treat it like work.

22:54.748 --> 22:55.957
I mean, it is work.

22:56.249 --> 22:58.543
War paint, uniform, script and rules.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.630
Say this, don't say that.
Do this, don't do that.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.632
It's all a hostage negotiation.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.718
Until the end, when
someone inescapably dies.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.720
Then, what a mess.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.222
It is always a mess.

23:10.430 --> 23:14.101
People think that there is a good,
easy, clean, fast way to do it.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.393
But there isn't.

23:15.477 --> 23:20.232
I mean, there is good, easy and fast,
but never clean and it's tough.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.526
No matter how many times you have done it.

23:22.651 --> 23:26.488
I just wish, when I was done with them,
they would just disappear.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.490
I don't know.

23:28.615 --> 23:30.700
Maybe I shouldn't go through with this.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.494
It has been so long.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.496
I am standing here,
second guessing my shoes,

23:34.704 --> 23:38.500
when no man has ever walked away
because of a woman's shoes.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.545
Why do we get dressed up like this at all?

23:43.505 --> 23:44.756
The guy never cares.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.965
Never.

23:46.091 --> 23:50.470
I mean, yeah, if you show up to an expensive
dinner in an oversized Mickey Mouse sweat shirt,

23:50.595 --> 23:52.514
he might shy away.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.516
I just mean, within reason.

23:54.683 --> 23:59.187
You think a guy ever goes back to his
buddies and says “She was nice, but damn bro,

23:59.396 --> 24:01.523
those Louboutins were a boner killer”.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.233
Not fucking likely.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.695
I am nervous.

24:07.028 --> 24:07.654
Me?

24:07.863 --> 24:08.864
Nervous?

24:09.072 --> 24:10.574
Of this?

24:13.493 --> 24:16.097
What are you talking about, you
already made the decision, this morning.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.414
Remember.

24:17.497 --> 24:19.791
I just don't know if my
courage will hold out.

24:21.877 --> 24:23.503
What? You didn't hear me honking?

24:23.712 --> 24:25.231
Doesn't matter.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.715
I got to take a shit anyway.

24:28.508 --> 24:29.885
I was out with the boys before.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.262
Got a whole fucking tub of wing,

24:32.471 --> 24:34.431
so I ain't really that hungry anyway.

24:34.681 --> 24:35.681
What's this?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.185
Apple?

24:39.186 --> 24:41.146
What are you fucking Hamish?

24:41.480 --> 24:47.486
So, you got something for me?

24:48.487 --> 24:49.488
Damn.

24:51.573 --> 24:52.616
You look good.

24:53.283 --> 24:55.243
Since I am not hungry.

24:55.368 --> 24:57.787
You could clearly stand to miss a meal.

24:58.413 --> 25:01.708
How about we just stay here, and fuck?

25:02.417 --> 25:03.777
I do got to take that dumb though.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.289
Hmm.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.739
That was easier than I thought.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.339
God what is this? Disappointment.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.552
Am I sad about missing dinner? Or am I
sad about that he didn't disappoint me?

26:12.070 --> 26:13.070
Bit, strange.

26:13.113 --> 26:16.783
You could have Uber bring Mc Donalds
to a house you rented on AirBnB,

26:17.075 --> 26:18.868
while you schedule an assassination online.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.884
It is a dangerous world.

26:36.803 --> 26:41.766
It's just convenient, that's all.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.461
Wow, that was something.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.337
Thanks.

27:12.505 --> 27:13.505
And now this.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.508
This is fascinating.

27:15.675 --> 27:17.093
The way she looks.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.262
The way she eats.

27:20.305 --> 27:23.516
You really need to tell me,
why I need to keep her here?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.935
You don't have your own garage or basement?

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
You see…

27:32.609 --> 27:34.069
Oh, she is here.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.710
Jay Daughter. How are you sweety?

28:33.503 --> 28:35.755
I almost didn't recognize you.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.091
Nice hair girl.

28:51.771 --> 28:55.525
So, why did the hell
raiser lady not come again?

28:56.443 --> 28:59.237
She is at the acupuncture place.

28:59.487 --> 29:00.488
Again?

29:00.864 --> 29:06.911
The doctor says that for her migraines
she should come to his office, each day.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.496
So she does.

29:08.621 --> 29:10.498
Seven days a week.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.459
Poor hell raiser lady.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.169
I miss her.

29:14.544 --> 29:18.506
Having the stuff in her face,
she can't even put her makeup on.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.801
Or even a basic base.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.679
Anyway,

29:25.805 --> 29:32.520
I must say ladies our Thursday hangouts, manicure, pedicure
at my house is what I am waiting for the whole week.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.521
Yeah.

29:33.688 --> 29:37.192
The “why we need to kill
each male technician in the city”.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.319
So there will be none.

29:39.861 --> 29:40.861
That's what we are.

29:41.154 --> 29:46.785
You know it could be better
if we order pineapple pizza.

29:47.076 --> 29:47.676
Yeah.

29:47.869 --> 29:49.746
Pineapple pizza is my favorite.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.582
Do you like pineapple
on pizza, Jay Daughter?

29:56.085 --> 29:58.922
Okay. Let me call Papa Jesus then.

30:04.511 --> 30:08.139
Are you sure you want to touch the subject?

30:08.515 --> 30:09.933
It is a delicate matter.

30:10.350 --> 30:12.811
We don't want Miranda to get mad.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.102
I don't know,

30:14.187 --> 30:15.688
maybe when she comes back,

30:15.897 --> 30:17.482
I will ask her.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.737
Okay. Ordered.

30:23.154 --> 30:24.864
One large with double pineapple.

30:25.782 --> 30:28.743
I wanted to ask you something.

30:29.536 --> 30:30.662
Okay. Shoot.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.833
Actually, Jay Daughter wanted to know...

30:35.500 --> 30:38.169
What? It is your idea.

30:38.628 --> 30:39.228
Wait.

30:39.379 --> 30:40.672
Jay Daughter talks?

30:41.089 --> 30:42.590
I thought she is mute.

30:43.466 --> 30:44.717
She is.

30:44.926 --> 30:48.388
She uses Morse alphabet to communicate.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.140
I am sorry, Alphabet what?

30:51.516 --> 30:53.601
Morse. Alphabet.

30:54.143 --> 30:57.856
You see, she blinks to me
and I read what she says.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.817
Fucking amazing. Can I try?

31:08.283 --> 31:10.618
She said there is no such word.

31:11.244 --> 31:14.831
I blinked like a hundred times,
it must mean something.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.791
What did you say?

31:17.417 --> 31:19.878
I asked her why her name is Jay Daughter.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.838
I still don't get it.

31:22.505 --> 31:26.092
Her father was a Jason,
so her name is Jay daughter.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.803
I thought you would know by now.

31:29.637 --> 31:30.346
Okay.

31:30.513 --> 31:31.973
I did not know that.

31:32.265 --> 31:33.265
I know now.

31:33.391 --> 31:37.353
You actually need to learn this language.
Just like any other language.

31:38.104 --> 31:39.104
Hmmm.

31:39.314 --> 31:41.900
Fuck it, then.
What did she want to know?

31:43.318 --> 31:46.487
She wanted to know why your brother…

31:47.030 --> 31:49.198
why your brother didn't kill Laurient.

31:49.407 --> 31:54.495
For so many years she seemed to be
unbeatable, untouchable, unbreakable.

31:54.871 --> 31:55.871
Shit,

31:56.122 --> 31:58.583
I knew this question would
pop out sooner than later.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.628
Don't answer if you don't want to.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.718
I told you she gets upset.

32:10.511 --> 32:11.679
No, I am good.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.515
You are my best friends
and you deserve to know.

32:15.099 --> 32:20.271
So today Lorry, played by actress
Miss Curtis has an appointment down town.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.523
She will be seeing her agent.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.818
Oh, she is play in the new movie.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.947
No it is her advertising agent.

32:29.322 --> 32:33.868
The new yogurt will hit the market soon
and they wanted her to advertise it on TV.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.204
You know, like a new commercial.

32:36.496 --> 32:38.081
New yogurt, huh?

32:38.373 --> 32:41.250
Yup and my brother is
planning to kill Lorry there.

32:41.417 --> 32:45.129
I mean Miss Curtis along
with some members of the agency.

32:45.505 --> 32:50.176
Maybe today is the
day he will finally kill her.

32:51.052 --> 32:52.679
What if he misses?

32:53.221 --> 32:55.390
Then she goes to the beach.

32:55.682 --> 32:57.183
He will follow her there.

32:57.392 --> 32:59.519
What if he misses her on the beach?

32:59.644 --> 33:03.731
Then she goes to the car dealer
and he will follow her each day.

33:04.190 --> 33:06.734
And I know each day is a failure,

33:07.235 --> 33:08.319
but he is strong.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.071
He never gives up.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.782
Once he starts something, he finishes it.

33:13.116 --> 33:14.784
That's just who he is.

33:17.870 --> 33:21.457
Jay Daughter says that
maybe he will fall in love with her.

33:21.708 --> 33:22.500
Lorry?

33:22.709 --> 33:23.709
No.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.919
He would tell me about it.

33:25.211 --> 33:26.754
That's impossible.

33:33.970 --> 33:35.138
I know this photo.

33:35.388 --> 33:36.514
It's old.

33:38.099 --> 33:41.227
And this is when it started, long time ago.

33:42.603 --> 33:43.813
I don't believe it.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.648
It is just photoshopped.

33:46.232 --> 33:46.832
Nope.

33:47.233 --> 33:48.735
I saw more online.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.946
They make sweaters together.
Sweaters.

33:53.281 --> 33:55.324
He brought five sweaters last weeks.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.493
I thought these were victims clothing.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.204
Wow, this is a shocker.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.207
I am going to have to
talk to Michael about this.

34:07.253 --> 34:07.853
Well.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.505
Right on time.

34:10.131 --> 34:11.674
Feeding time.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.776
Girls help me out.

34:52.715 --> 34:53.715
Eat.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.678
Uh-huh.

35:01.849 --> 35:03.267
It will take some time.

35:03.643 --> 35:05.103
She will eat eventually.

35:05.353 --> 35:08.564
You girls want to read some
other stories in the meantime?

35:45.685 --> 35:53.685
Death. Holy death.

35:57.446 --> 35:58.489
Okay.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.199
You got this.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.249
This is meant to be.

36:01.450 --> 36:03.095
Pam, you have ten
minutes till we are rolling.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.120
What?

36:04.412 --> 36:05.329
Are you calling me Jess?

36:05.371 --> 36:08.332
I wish I was fucking joking.
I also wish you were not an hour late.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.060
What are you talking about?
Call time is at 3.

36:10.084 --> 36:11.169
No, it was at 2.

36:11.377 --> 36:13.880
Auditions are always just
so nerve wrecking for me. I am sorry.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.465
I told you not to kiss me
in front of people that know me.

36:16.632 --> 36:17.633
Sorry. I forgot.

36:17.842 --> 36:18.467
Be quiet.

36:18.593 --> 36:22.739
Jessie, you painted sixteen lollipops this morning,
we need to double that before we wrap today. Alright.

36:22.763 --> 36:24.140
Fucking, Jesus Christ.

36:24.348 --> 36:26.058
Great feat cell sir. Three ice cubes. Go.

36:26.267 --> 36:27.935
But when exactly should I do something.

36:28.269 --> 36:28.869
I don't care.

36:28.978 --> 36:30.164
Do it during your lunch break, okay?

36:30.188 --> 36:33.542
Honestly, nobody should be eating or shitting,
till the network picks this up. Alright.

36:33.566 --> 36:34.566
Ryan,

36:34.609 --> 36:35.609
fix the fucking lighting.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.588
How many times have I told you
that it is an intel stop fucking…

36:37.612 --> 36:41.574
If I have to paint one more fucking lollipop,
I will burn this place to the ground.

36:41.824 --> 36:44.952
I know. I know. I know.
You are a really hard worker, Okay?

36:45.286 --> 36:48.682
Just know that I wouldn't have made it this
far if it hadn't been my second in the lane.

36:48.706 --> 36:51.626
That's bullshit Kim.
You know you don't need me.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.854
You know you wouldn't have made it
this far, unless the costume director…

36:53.878 --> 36:56.505
I said, don't kiss me in
front of people that know me.

36:56.672 --> 36:59.425
Sorry. I thought we were having a moment.

36:59.550 --> 37:01.177
Argh.

37:01.385 --> 37:02.887
Wait right here, and do not move.

37:03.179 --> 37:06.474
Jason Carrigan's screen testing right now.
It's between you and him.

37:06.641 --> 37:08.226
Jason Carrigan?

37:08.517 --> 37:10.978
The internet's boyfriend Justin Carrigan.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.813
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:13.105 --> 37:16.567
Yeah, just cause he has like a million
followers doesn't mean he is a good actor.

37:16.817 --> 37:19.487
Try to loosen up a little bit.

37:19.654 --> 37:21.239
It is a kid's show.

37:23.157 --> 37:31.157
Death. Holy Death.

37:39.882 --> 37:41.092
Oh shucks.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.843
I sure am sad.

37:43.135 --> 37:45.346
It is okay to be sad some times.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.515
But it is always better
to be with a friend.

37:47.723 --> 37:51.394
And. In. In. Stop. Stop.
That's a fucking money maker right there.

37:51.519 --> 37:55.106
I sure wish I could find
my way out of this candy palace.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.066
Oh, I know.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.236
I will just sing the song
the villager taught me…

37:59.277 --> 38:01.437
Beautiful. Beautiful.
You look so fucking good.

38:03.489 --> 38:04.907
Dungo. Dungo.

38:05.199 --> 38:07.151
Come save the day.

38:07.201 --> 38:08.494
Dungo. Dungo.

38:08.703 --> 38:10.496
Your help's the only way.

38:10.746 --> 38:12.415
Dungo. Dungo.

38:12.540 --> 38:15.918
Come save the day.

38:16.961 --> 38:20.298
Dungo. Dungo.
Your help's the only way.

38:33.811 --> 38:34.812
Dungo.

38:35.104 --> 38:37.398
Holy gum drops, it worked.

38:37.523 --> 38:40.359
Can you use your magic
to get us out of this place?

38:40.526 --> 38:44.363
The villagers said you are
the most magical creature in all the world

38:44.488 --> 38:46.324
and I would love to fly away with you,

38:46.490 --> 38:51.495
I am kind of scared here and lonely
and I don't like it one bit.

38:51.620 --> 38:53.414
Can we have friendship forever,

38:53.497 --> 38:58.252
and bonding, and go fishing,
and do things that fathers and sons do?

38:58.461 --> 39:03.299
I will be your little tiny monster.
Haha. Can we hug?

39:03.674 --> 39:05.051
Yay.

39:05.468 --> 39:07.845
Awww... you are so warm.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.597
Kim.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.266
Kim.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.309
Oh, sorry.

39:13.517 --> 39:15.269
I said in your own time, not never. Okay?

39:15.478 --> 39:17.146
Camera speed.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.732
Oh jee, I sure am sad…

39:19.982 --> 39:21.150
Louder please.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.610
Still speeding.

39:23.069 --> 39:26.655
Jee, I sure am sad. It's
okay to be sad.. okay…

39:26.864 --> 39:28.175
Can we try with a little
more charisma, please?

39:28.199 --> 39:31.428
Remember, you have been caught in this candy forest
for days and your tummy is full of gum drops.

39:31.452 --> 39:33.079
You..you want to go home.

39:33.788 --> 39:34.788
Still speeding.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.374
What are you doing?

39:38.417 --> 39:40.544
Oh Jee, I sure am sad.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.297
It's okay to be sad some times,

39:44.215 --> 39:46.342
but it is better to have a friend.

39:47.176 --> 39:48.928
I wish I had a friend.

39:49.220 --> 39:50.220
Alright.

39:51.305 --> 39:55.309
I wish I had a friend
who could help me out of the candy forest.

39:55.518 --> 39:58.437
Oh, I will sing the song
the villagers taught me.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.398
The Gill is just going to fucking hate it.

40:01.941 --> 40:02.566
Dungo...

40:02.775 --> 40:06.779
Dungo. Dungo. Come save the day.

40:06.904 --> 40:11.200
Dungo. Dungo.
Your help is the only way…

40:11.409 --> 40:12.701
ayyy…

40:13.494 --> 40:14.570
yyy...

40:14.620 --> 40:18.165
Sorry. I was...
it was at home and it was good.

40:19.291 --> 40:21.502
Your helps the only way.

40:22.294 --> 40:24.422
I can do it again if you want or…

40:24.630 --> 40:26.590
let me just. I will give it another...

40:27.133 --> 40:28.133
everyone is so quiet.

40:48.070 --> 40:48.750
Dungo, it worked.

40:48.904 --> 40:50.156
It worked.

40:50.781 --> 40:53.659
Dungo, can you use your magic to help me?

40:54.660 --> 40:57.746
Now big hug for Dungo buddy. Big hug.

41:00.207 --> 41:02.543
Big hug for Dungo.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.404
Hmmm. You are blowing up.

41:30.571 --> 41:36.535
Huh? Oh. Sorry. It's just spam. You know.

41:36.827 --> 41:39.497
I feel you girl. Agents and stuff. Like.

41:40.247 --> 41:41.247
Uh-huh.

41:45.794 --> 41:47.505
Hey, errr…

41:47.838 --> 41:51.342
it's a little awkward because
we are wearing the same outfit.

41:51.592 --> 41:53.427
We match. Hmmm… haha...

41:53.802 --> 41:58.182
Uh-huh… this is just the
costume for the production.

41:58.390 --> 42:00.893
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I was making a joke.

42:01.227 --> 42:02.228
Oh, a joke.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.938
Oh... haha...

42:04.271 --> 42:05.272
Oh. That's good.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.607
I am Kim,

42:07.566 --> 42:09.610
by the way. That's my name.

42:09.944 --> 42:11.362
Yeah, Jason.

42:12.488 --> 42:14.114
Well I recognize you.

42:15.115 --> 42:16.617
You were in crime scene Anna High.

42:16.825 --> 42:18.536
Yeah. Yeah. I was.

42:18.744 --> 42:22.665
Oh my God, I feel like this is so weird. I
should be star struck. You are Jason Carrigan.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.333
You were the pervert lady.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.503
Yeah. Yeah. I was.
I was the crazy pervert lady.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.754
Yo. I loved it.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.341
You killed your fiancé and you just
start rubbing your shit everywhere.

42:32.508 --> 42:36.929
All over his body, and stuff. Oh my God.
Did they use real poop in that show?

42:37.263 --> 42:39.473
I am actually.
I think I might be your neighbor.

42:39.640 --> 42:41.850
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I live on Gilbert Avenue.

42:42.142 --> 42:44.395
Yeah, you are on the century Condos.

42:44.562 --> 42:47.439
No, I am actually at Shermen's.

42:47.606 --> 42:48.941
Across the street.

42:49.233 --> 42:53.487
It was like a motel, now it is like, sort
of like condos and sort mostly. Motel still.

42:53.696 --> 42:55.906
Oh, I still approve. I like that.
Yeah.

42:56.198 --> 42:59.638
I am just trying to think of a good caption
for this picture I took with Dungo earlier.

42:59.743 --> 43:03.581
Oh, you got a pic with Dungo.
Yeah.

43:04.206 --> 43:05.206
You didn't?

43:05.249 --> 43:08.961
Oh, no. I am not online,
so I wouldn't have anywhere to post it.

43:09.253 --> 43:10.253
Dude.

43:10.879 --> 43:13.340
Advice from one artist to another.

43:14.049 --> 43:17.511
All they care about is fucking likes,
followers and shit.

43:17.886 --> 43:20.389
Got to play the game, but it sucks.

43:20.514 --> 43:21.181
Yeah.
Right.

43:21.390 --> 43:24.518
Yeah. Yeah. I didn't want to say anything
but it is total bullshit.

43:24.560 --> 43:25.560
What the fuck?

43:25.853 --> 43:27.354
Did you just call my job, bullshit?

43:27.521 --> 43:30.691
Oh my God, no.
I am sorry, that was not…I am…

43:31.191 --> 43:32.276
I am just playing with you.

43:32.484 --> 43:33.924
It was a joke, like you did earlier.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.279
Hahaha...

43:35.487 --> 43:38.032
Oh, that's funny.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.326
Listen though, I feel you.

43:40.618 --> 43:42.494
I mean on the upside,

43:42.703 --> 43:45.623
I have a platform that raise money for
the kids' charity I started though.

43:45.831 --> 43:46.498
So that's tight.

43:46.707 --> 43:49.126
Oh. Wow, that's amazing.

43:49.335 --> 43:51.253
Kids are pretty much
my target demo right now.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.256
I thought you just did a
collab with Calvin Klein.

43:55.132 --> 43:56.717
Kelvins for kids.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.346
Dude, it is so sick.

44:00.638 --> 44:01.638
So sick.

44:01.805 --> 44:02.514
Cool.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.307
Yeah.
Cool.

44:03.515 --> 44:07.519
I mean by 2025, we want Calvins
on every homeless kid of America.

44:07.686 --> 44:09.980
You know.
Your pants have a home with us.

44:10.272 --> 44:11.272
Haha.

44:11.565 --> 44:16.028
Yeah, that actually might… that sounds
good, and it would work out for sure.

44:16.236 --> 44:19.698
But, you know, it is shitty that you had
to do all those productions with Dungo.

44:19.907 --> 44:20.907
You know.

44:21.408 --> 44:22.868
I am not…what do you mean?

44:23.869 --> 44:28.082
Oh, just that like,
Dungo is like extremely ugly

44:28.290 --> 44:32.544
and it looks like a fucking like sesame
street like kitchen sink monster.

44:32.753 --> 44:33.837
Haha.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.089
Maybe.

44:35.506 --> 44:37.146
I don't know. It might as well be my dad.

44:38.092 --> 44:38.692
Jason.

44:38.759 --> 44:41.112
They want to see you in hair and
makeup again before the dance sequence.

44:41.136 --> 44:42.554
Oh hey. Thanks Jess.

44:43.472 --> 44:45.224
Hey, by the way,

44:45.849 --> 44:48.745
hope this is not like awkward, we are
going out for the same role and everything.

44:48.769 --> 44:50.521
You know. Take it easy.

44:58.362 --> 45:00.197
You know I am a good dancer,

45:00.406 --> 45:03.742
and I botched that first part,
but I am going to kill it in this.

45:04.034 --> 45:06.805
I am going to focus, it is going to be really
good and I promise I won't disappoint you…

45:06.829 --> 45:09.749
Kim, I am sorry. I am really sorry.
This is just as far as I can take you.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.917
Jess, can you fit Jason
into his dance unit, please.

45:12.209 --> 45:13.752
Yes, of course.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.523
Weren't you the pervert lady,
from crime scene Anna High,

45:16.547 --> 45:18.632
who like to smeer shit
over her dead fiancé,

45:18.841 --> 45:21.301
and all over the walls and
threw it at the cops and all that.

45:21.927 --> 45:22.927
Yeah.

45:23.512 --> 45:26.473
And now you are auditioning
for a childrens program?

45:26.974 --> 45:28.142
Yes, sir.

45:28.392 --> 45:31.478
Can we get the casting director…

45:31.937 --> 45:32.937
Kim.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.692
It was Dungo.
If the design is tweaked a little bit, I…

45:36.900 --> 45:38.444
Kim, it is not Don Go.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.070
I just can't keep doing this.

45:40.320 --> 45:44.241
I can't keep getting you jobs on productions
and.. and…just have you tank them.

45:44.491 --> 45:46.034
Like, is this what you really want?

45:46.243 --> 45:48.078
Okay, it was Don Go.

45:48.328 --> 45:51.415
And he's so fucked up looking,
I couldn't concentrate. It is not my fault.

45:51.540 --> 45:52.540
It is not Don Go.

45:52.708 --> 45:56.879
Okay, why doesn't nobody
else realize that this monster looks crazy.

45:57.171 --> 45:58.571
Like, I feel like I am going crazy.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.758
Okay. You need to leave,
you are embarrassing me.

46:01.300 --> 46:02.300
Jess.

46:02.718 --> 46:03.718
No.

46:04.219 --> 46:07.264
Please, no. You know I can do this.
You know I need this.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.433
I need this, please. Please. Please.

46:10.184 --> 46:11.268
Background.

46:21.487 --> 46:22.487
What?

46:23.697 --> 46:26.092
What do you mean they can count
with negative.

46:27.284 --> 46:31.747
No mom, listen, I just got back
from very promising audition and…

46:31.830 --> 46:33.165
What if you just came back home?

46:33.373 --> 46:36.919
No, I am not gonna come home.
I just need a couple more months.

46:37.419 --> 46:39.338
I have gone on TV, didn't I.

46:40.506 --> 46:42.226
Jesus Fucking Christ!

46:42.382 --> 46:45.260
No, it is acting. I didn't really eat poop.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.056
What do you mean, dad's embarrassed?

46:49.473 --> 46:52.851
Does he know that Crime Scene Anna High
right in passage with Hollywood?

46:55.479 --> 46:57.356
Okay, I will talk to you tomorrow mom.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.650
I will talk to you tomorrow.

47:04.822 --> 47:07.199
Oh Jee, I sure am sad.

47:09.660 --> 47:12.162
But it is okay to be sad some times.

47:12.371 --> 47:13.413
Boys and girls.

47:18.460 --> 47:19.586
But,

47:20.462 --> 47:23.090
sure helps to have a friend some time.

47:26.885 --> 47:28.178
Shucks,

47:28.512 --> 47:31.306
I wish I could find my way
out of the candy palace.

47:33.517 --> 47:39.064
Oh, I know I will sing the
song the villagers taught me.

47:40.190 --> 47:43.944
Dungo. Dungo. Dungo.
Come save the day.

47:44.278 --> 47:48.323
Dungo. Dungo.
Your help is the only way.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.859
Fucking trash.

48:03.213 --> 48:04.213
Hello?

48:07.384 --> 48:10.387
I can hear someone. You better watch out.

48:12.848 --> 48:15.142
If you are in here. I will…I will get you.

48:28.655 --> 48:29.740
Who the fuck are you?

48:32.492 --> 48:35.078
Okay. I don't know what is going on.

48:35.579 --> 48:39.082
I know you think this is funny.
But, I..I have had a really shitty day.

48:39.291 --> 48:41.501
And you just have to take
the Dungo costume and go.

48:41.835 --> 48:45.172
This. This isn't costume.

48:45.881 --> 48:47.424
Jesus Christ.

48:48.425 --> 48:49.718
Did I hit you hard?

48:50.928 --> 48:52.888
Jesus Christ. Okay let me.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.484
Let me take that thing off your head.
And let's see what is going on.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.520
How did you.. okay, I am going to Yank it.

49:02.606 --> 49:04.524
What the fuck?

49:07.736 --> 49:09.821
Is this…

49:11.198 --> 49:15.118
Wake up. This isn't real.
You are high. This isn't real.

49:15.494 --> 49:17.788
I am real Dungo.
What the fuck?

49:24.419 --> 49:25.879
What is happening?

49:26.463 --> 49:28.173
You called me ugly.

49:29.675 --> 49:30.384
What?

49:30.509 --> 49:34.096
You said I am kitchen
sink sesame street monster.

49:35.222 --> 49:36.515
Maybe you monster.

49:36.765 --> 49:39.559
Okay. Okay, maybe I am. Can you go?

49:39.768 --> 49:41.436
Jason is strong.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.522
He not monster.

49:44.064 --> 49:45.983
Jessie likes Jason more.

49:47.526 --> 49:53.448
Okay, he has like a million followers and also it
is LA, you don't get everything you audition for.

49:53.573 --> 49:54.866
Jason does.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.494
You are the one who fucked it up for me.

49:57.619 --> 49:58.829
I did good job.

49:59.246 --> 50:00.914
You f-word it up.

50:01.581 --> 50:03.542
You f-word everything up.

50:03.709 --> 50:07.838
Well fine, I will move back to
Gary Indiana with mommy and daddy.

50:08.088 --> 50:11.133
Is that what you want Dungo?
Does that make you happy?

50:14.219 --> 50:15.637
I just..I…

50:15.804 --> 50:17.264
I want an act.

50:17.597 --> 50:22.394
I thought maybe I could get a part
as a sassy best friend, in a rom-com.

50:22.519 --> 50:29.067
Or a guest appearance on a real show.
But, maybe I am just not meant for this.

50:30.694 --> 50:32.404
What does Dungo do?

50:33.155 --> 50:34.197
What?

50:35.699 --> 50:37.117
What does Dungo do?

50:37.325 --> 50:38.869
I don't know Dungo. What do you do?

50:39.161 --> 50:40.829
You sing Dungo song.

50:41.455 --> 50:43.165
Dungo saves the day.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.417
Dungo is the only way.

50:48.920 --> 50:54.509
Dungo is here to save you.
I am the only way.

50:55.135 --> 51:01.516
Okay, I don't know what you are talking about.
This is crazy. I am just going to go home.

51:01.808 --> 51:05.520
They win if you go back to India.

51:05.687 --> 51:08.857
It is Indiana. Plus,
what are you going to do anyways?

51:09.316 --> 51:12.069
Call Jason Carrigan and
beg him to give me the job.

51:13.487 --> 51:15.489
Jason goes away.

51:15.864 --> 51:20.077
It is not Jason, it is me.
I don't have what people want.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.703
I wasn't meant for this.

51:22.204 --> 51:23.497
You were meant for this.

51:26.249 --> 51:27.249
Ouch.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.169
You were meant for this.

51:30.337 --> 51:31.338
Dungo's palace.

51:31.505 --> 51:32.547
Say.

51:32.798 --> 51:33.816
I was meant for this.

51:33.840 --> 51:35.550
You were meant for this.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.385
I was meant for this.

51:37.552 --> 51:39.763
You were meant for this.

51:39.971 --> 51:41.473
I was meant for this.
Come on.

51:41.598 --> 51:44.351
You were meant for this. Come on.
I was meant for this.

51:44.518 --> 51:46.394
You were meant for this.
I was meant for this.

51:47.896 --> 51:49.940
I was meant for this.

51:50.232 --> 51:51.650
I was meant for this.

51:51.858 --> 51:53.318
I was meant for this.

51:53.527 --> 51:58.782
I was meant for this.

52:13.046 --> 52:14.631
What the fuck Cam?

52:14.798 --> 52:16.526
You should have called
if you were gonna show up like this

52:16.550 --> 52:17.634
I got rid of my phone.

52:17.884 --> 52:20.345
We need to have this
conversation but not here

52:20.387 --> 52:22.430
Jesse I was meant for this

52:22.556 --> 52:25.767
Dude what are you talking about
Richie's probably shutting down production

52:28.562 --> 52:29.162
Go

52:29.437 --> 52:33.525
Jason couldn't show up for the
dance sequence he's like in the hospital

52:33.608 --> 52:34.276
I know

52:34.484 --> 52:37.404
Wait. Wait. Why did you say I know?

52:37.571 --> 52:41.616
I didn't say anything
Oh god Cam tell me you didn't do anything

52:43.368 --> 52:44.703
I didn't do anything

52:52.377 --> 52:58.216
I don't think I'll go back to the village now
because of Dungo this candy palace is my new home.

52:58.425 --> 53:04.723
Dungo is my best friend and you know that when
you have a best friend you always want to dance.

54:09.162 --> 54:10.789
Ah hey um Cam

54:12.749 --> 54:15.418
Can you do that a couple more times for us?

54:16.544 --> 54:17.587
Yeah

54:17.712 --> 54:20.924
Yeah I can

55:09.431 --> 55:10.431
Yeah

55:10.515 --> 55:12.100
That's what I have right now

55:12.267 --> 55:13.267
Yes I like it

55:13.351 --> 55:14.853
Jay Daughter?

55:17.147 --> 55:21.818
Huh that's weird she ate like crazy for
the past 30 days and now she stopped

55:22.319 --> 55:23.445
Just like that

55:23.778 --> 55:25.822
Maybe she's a vegan.

55:27.073 --> 55:30.285
Don't you think I would have known
that by now something is wrong.

55:32.078 --> 55:33.246
Are you a vegan?

55:35.123 --> 55:36.750
Maybe she just became one.

55:37.042 --> 55:39.794
You know some people stop
eating meat in a flash of a second

55:40.086 --> 55:44.591
they eat meat their whole life and
then they're vegan just like that

55:45.592 --> 55:48.553
Did you just become a vegan just like that?

55:54.976 --> 55:58.188
Jay daughter thinks
our guest might be ready.

55:58.396 --> 55:59.564
Ready for what?

56:00.315 --> 56:02.150
To show her skills.

56:17.082 --> 56:18.249
Read it

56:19.250 --> 56:21.586
Have a nice day Michael happy killing.

56:22.337 --> 56:25.131
What the Fuck is this she sounds like me

56:25.340 --> 56:28.510
Hello she can do all of our voices

56:29.469 --> 56:30.845
Hello Miranda.

56:31.179 --> 56:33.139
I want to play a game.

56:33.723 --> 56:35.141
No fucking way.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.477
Yes fucking way.

56:38.311 --> 56:39.813
Can she do yours?

56:41.523 --> 56:42.649
Please.

56:43.108 --> 56:48.613
Well this is my other mask
my original mask is at the cleaners.

56:50.615 --> 56:53.701
This is insane so she
can do Jay Daughter's too.

56:53.910 --> 56:56.121
Oh I forgot she can't.

56:56.704 --> 57:01.084
But she can blink the same way as J
Daughter. She knows morse alphabet.

57:09.426 --> 57:13.096
Unbelievable she has a freaking talent.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.807
We have the real deal here.

57:16.224 --> 57:18.810
Okay but why is she here?

57:19.144 --> 57:20.520
What's the point?

57:20.770 --> 57:24.816
You see your brother Michael
already read the script for this film.

57:25.817 --> 57:27.193
What film?

57:31.656 --> 57:32.656
Never mind.

57:32.824 --> 57:37.495
The important thing is that Michael already knows
that we know that he fell in love with Laury

57:37.662 --> 57:41.082
and now he is on the
way back here to kill us all.

57:41.624 --> 57:43.668
This person here will survive.

57:43.877 --> 57:45.211
Only her.

57:45.420 --> 57:50.508
She will later go to a film post-production
studio to record all her voices for this film.

57:51.718 --> 57:52.318
What?

57:52.552 --> 57:56.514
Yeah that's true I read the script
I survive and the rest of you don't.

57:57.223 --> 57:58.516
Shut the fuck up.

57:59.809 --> 58:00.809
Sorry.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.146
Nobody asked you about anything.

58:03.521 --> 58:05.064
What is going on here?

58:05.273 --> 58:06.858
The director of this movie…

58:07.150 --> 58:10.487
What fucking movie?
Franny is this some kind of prank?

58:10.737 --> 58:12.238
No prank Miranda.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.574
Your next story is written by itself.

58:14.824 --> 58:17.452
Don't worry you're not
going to see the end anyway.

58:17.869 --> 58:23.124
The director just changed the title from
“Halloween Ends” to “Halloween Friends”.

58:25.710 --> 58:27.504
I thought you were my best friend.

58:28.379 --> 58:30.173
I'm still your best friend.

58:30.465 --> 58:32.509
Stop it Franny. It's not funny.

58:32.634 --> 58:34.135
Stop what Miranda?

58:34.511 --> 58:38.806
You know I have never ever pranked on you
and this is just fucking with me.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.518
Okay. It's not a prank.

58:42.519 --> 58:46.564
Okay so it's not a prank is
there anything we can do?

58:46.773 --> 58:52.195
No I read the whole screenplay
and whatever we do is just pointless.

58:52.904 --> 58:53.904
So,

58:54.489 --> 58:57.242
we'll just have to wait for
Michael to come home? Huh?

58:57.450 --> 59:01.246
Yes do you have another story to read?

59:02.163 --> 59:04.290
Of course I have tons of them.

59:11.923 --> 59:13.466
Can I read?

59:16.135 --> 59:17.720
Sure. Come closer.

59:38.324 --> 59:39.576
Are we recording?

59:40.118 --> 59:42.495
Yes you can start by introducing yourself.

59:42.829 --> 59:43.829
Okay.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.707
It's me Dracula.

59:47.417 --> 59:53.214
I'm just playing it's the Dracula.
Nosferatu. Prince of darkness.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.550
Pokel for the family back home in Romania.

59:56.092 --> 59:57.218
Transylvania.

59:57.510 --> 59:59.137
T-town baby.

1:00:00.972 --> 1:00:05.351
So we all decided to move from Transylvania
to a nice community in Florida.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:10.148
If you've never been to Florida in the summer,
it feels like the nether regions of hell.

1:00:10.690 --> 1:00:12.317
You would know, right?

1:00:13.610 --> 1:00:15.111
I'm sorry what was that?

1:00:15.778 --> 1:00:20.408
Uh I said, you would know
what the nether regions of hell feels like.

1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:23.494
I'm Dracula.

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:25.371
Not Satan.

1:00:28.791 --> 1:00:29.791
Umm...

1:00:30.251 --> 1:00:32.795
Are you guys trying to blend
into your new surroundings?

1:00:33.588 --> 1:00:35.340
Yes. Yes we are.

1:00:35.506 --> 1:00:38.343
For example I just recently
joined the book club.

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:45.600
Okay everybody this week's book
was Twilight by Stephanie Meyer.

1:00:45.850 --> 1:00:46.850
Opinions?

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:47.934
Ideas?

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:49.312
Thoughts?

1:00:49.854 --> 1:00:51.481
Amy would you like to begin?

1:00:52.315 --> 1:00:55.568
Found it to be a great
modern twist on a classic story.

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:58.196
Thank you Amy.

1:00:58.821 --> 1:00:59.821
Stephanie?

1:01:00.698 --> 1:01:01.858
I don't know.

1:01:01.908 --> 1:01:04.661
I kind of thought it was,
you know, very romantic.

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:06.495
Romantic?

1:01:06.704 --> 1:01:09.957
Yeah. A little erotic.

1:01:13.753 --> 1:01:14.796
Seriously?

1:01:16.255 --> 1:01:21.302
A 465 year old man falling
over the high schooler?

1:01:21.511 --> 1:01:23.513
You don't find that a little creepy?

1:01:23.763 --> 1:01:24.931
Okay am I right?

1:01:25.264 --> 1:01:29.519
Mr. Dracula everyone is entitled
to their own opinion.

1:01:29.811 --> 1:01:35.692
There's opinion and
then I mean it's not erotic.

1:01:36.150 --> 1:01:38.486
It's creepy Stephanie

1:01:41.781 --> 1:01:46.494
Mr. Dracula I have to ask you to leave.

1:01:48.579 --> 1:01:49.579
Me?

1:01:58.798 --> 1:02:00.800
Amy

1:02:01.926 --> 1:02:03.094
Tammy

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:06.888
Wow

1:02:08.891 --> 1:02:09.976
Okay

1:02:10.518 --> 1:02:11.519
Alright.

1:02:15.523 --> 1:02:16.858
I know I'm not wanted.

1:02:21.612 --> 1:02:22.612
Good day.

1:02:28.161 --> 1:02:32.749
Dracula is a lot of things
but a pedophile he is not.

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:36.627
I'm doing pretty well than
I was doing in Transylvania.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.713
I have started modeling.

1:02:43.509 --> 1:02:44.510
I don't get it.

1:02:45.511 --> 1:02:46.637
What?
The modeling?

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:47.846
Yeah.

1:02:48.181 --> 1:02:50.850
Isn't Dracula supposed to be the sexy one?

1:02:51.184 --> 1:02:53.519
You've seen Braum
stoker's uh Dracula, right?

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:55.145
Look at this.

1:02:55.313 --> 1:02:56.564
One big ball of hair.

1:02:57.106 --> 1:02:58.941
It's like the 70s all over again.

1:03:05.823 --> 1:03:07.468
All right wolfie give me
some more teeth now.

1:03:07.492 --> 1:03:10.870

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:15.374

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:18.669
You're looking great.
Wolfie you're looking great.

1:03:22.507 --> 1:03:26.344
I don't know if you heard
but I got a DUI recently.

1:03:27.428 --> 1:03:28.471
What happened?

1:03:29.222 --> 1:03:31.224
I didn't know what a blood mobile was.

1:03:31.432 --> 1:03:33.726
You know the bus where you donate blood.

1:03:34.101 --> 1:03:39.065
Well I smell something cooking one day
and just wandered onto one.

1:03:57.291 --> 1:04:01.128
I ended up going on a pretty heavy bender
and tried to drive home.

1:04:02.547 --> 1:04:04.090
It wasn't my best moment.

1:04:05.550 --> 1:04:07.510
How are the neighbours
reacting to you guys?

1:04:08.177 --> 1:04:09.929
Good.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:15.142
Well there was an incident with
the camp girl yesterday.

1:04:15.518 --> 1:04:17.311
Bad.

1:04:21.232 --> 1:04:23.276
Hello would you like to buy some cookies?

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:24.527
You can try some.

1:04:31.784 --> 1:04:33.870
More. More cookies. More.

1:04:34.161 --> 1:04:35.746
No.

1:04:40.042 --> 1:04:43.212
They were pretty understanding
about the whole ordeal.

1:04:53.139 --> 1:04:54.599
Yo.
Wait, what are you doing?

1:04:54.807 --> 1:05:00.104
Hey, what?

1:05:01.355 --> 1:05:03.441
No. This is makeup.

1:05:03.524 --> 1:05:04.317
Okay. Okay.

1:05:04.525 --> 1:05:08.738
I sometimes like to you know wear
makeup that's not weird right?

1:05:09.488 --> 1:05:11.282
Everybody wears makeup, right?

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:13.242
Alright. Alright.

1:05:13.451 --> 1:05:15.328
You guys can come back later just not now.

1:05:17.496 --> 1:05:18.748
Wow.

1:05:45.816 --> 1:05:48.194
Do you think the neighbors
are starting to accept you?

1:05:51.113 --> 1:05:53.824
Yeah I think the neighbors
are starting to come around.

1:06:21.602 --> 1:06:23.229
Sorry.

1:06:35.950 --> 1:06:38.494
Give me a second I think
somebody's at the door.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:40.621
I'll be right back.

1:06:45.459 --> 1:06:46.459
Hey there.

1:06:46.544 --> 1:06:49.588

homeowners association.

1:06:50.256 --> 1:06:56.887

1:06:57.179 --> 1:06:58.848
Yeah that's me. What's up?

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:01.517
Well we've had some complaints.

1:07:01.684 --> 1:07:06.397
See your neighbors saw you walking your dog
and he wasn't on a leash.

1:07:06.731 --> 1:07:07.523
Wait a dog?

1:07:07.732 --> 1:07:08.732
I don't have a dog?

1:07:08.774 --> 1:07:09.374
What dog?

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:12.278
Well see one of your neighbors
sent me this picture. Right here.

1:07:13.529 --> 1:07:14.697
That dog.

1:07:15.072 --> 1:07:16.552
Yeah listen I know it's embarrassing.

1:07:16.741 --> 1:07:19.160
My wife dresses our dog up to…

1:07:19.869 --> 1:07:20.661
I'll tell you what?

1:07:20.870 --> 1:07:24.248
This one it's on the house okay.

1:07:26.417 --> 1:07:31.088
Alright you got me I promise I'll have him
on the leash from now on. No problem.

1:07:31.338 --> 1:07:35.426
Hey thanks buddy and also if you could
just get this cleaned up that'd be great.

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:37.803

1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:42.685
You have a happened to help them alright.
Thanks buddy. See you next time

1:07:46.896 --> 1:07:50.733
Hey Wolfie come here boy.
Time to go for a walk.

1:07:54.070 --> 1:07:57.198
I mean let's be honest,
the bride of Frankenstein.

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:00.367
Hot!

1:08:01.494 --> 1:08:06.540
But, for a very long time now I've been
trying to figure out what she sees in frank.

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.501
I mean. I don't get it. I mean…

1:08:13.714 --> 1:08:14.757
I mean what is that?

1:08:15.216 --> 1:08:17.456
Like I don't understand like
how is this guy functioning?

1:08:19.095 --> 1:08:22.848
This is what she likes?
I don't know.

1:08:23.641 --> 1:08:26.185
I don't get it I just don't get it.

1:08:52.461 --> 1:08:54.255
Come to bed Frankie

1:08:54.505 --> 1:08:56.173
Show not over.

1:08:57.591 --> 1:09:00.094
I'll give you something better to look at.

1:09:11.355 --> 1:09:15.526
I guess it's just one of those
great mysteries of the world.

1:09:18.821 --> 1:09:21.115
Frank have you seen the remote?

1:09:23.534 --> 1:09:24.743
What are you watching?

1:09:25.703 --> 1:09:27.204
Frank the remote.

1:09:27.413 --> 1:09:28.413
Frank

1:09:28.622 --> 1:09:29.790
Frank.

1:09:30.916 --> 1:09:34.211
We go through this every night with this.
Remote.

1:09:35.504 --> 1:09:37.464
Are you sitting on it again?

1:09:41.385 --> 1:09:43.345
What is this a zucchini?

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:48.267
Frank how many times
I have to tell you not to eat upstairs.

1:09:48.475 --> 1:09:50.686
We have an infestation of bugs.

1:09:50.895 --> 1:09:53.147
I gotta do everything around here.

1:09:53.898 --> 1:09:55.149
Alright.

1:09:55.399 --> 1:09:56.399
Huh...

1:09:57.234 --> 1:09:58.819
Why is it stuck?

1:10:00.070 --> 1:10:01.070
Huh...

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:02.531
What the…

1:10:14.668 --> 1:10:16.253
What the fuck?

1:10:17.504 --> 1:10:18.505
Well.

1:10:19.924 --> 1:10:21.634
Mystery solved.

1:10:25.638 --> 1:10:29.141
So today I'm on set on a talk
show called pay up or shut up.

1:10:29.433 --> 1:10:33.354
Some girl Wolfie, used to go out with is trying
to say that he's the father one of her kids.

1:10:33.562 --> 1:10:34.562
You believe that?

1:10:34.939 --> 1:10:36.106
Do you think he's the father?

1:10:36.523 --> 1:10:37.691
Of course not.

1:10:37.733 --> 1:10:39.526
I mean, could you imagine?

1:10:40.194 --> 1:10:41.194
Look at him.

1:10:41.820 --> 1:10:42.820
He's disgusting.

1:10:44.448 --> 1:10:45.491
I'm just kidding.

1:10:45.574 --> 1:10:47.868
I'm here for you buddy.

1:10:51.538 --> 1:10:55.501
And welcome back to another
episode of pay up or shut up.

1:10:56.168 --> 1:10:57.670
Our next baby daddy…

1:10:57.878 --> 1:11:01.757
well he won't even acknowledge his own son.

1:11:02.091 --> 1:11:05.427
Oh I know. I know. I know.

1:11:05.594 --> 1:11:07.471
He won't pay child support.

1:11:07.554 --> 1:11:11.267
He refuses to pay child support
because he says the baby isn't his.

1:11:13.310 --> 1:11:16.397
I know but we are going
to set the record straight.

1:11:16.522 --> 1:11:19.525
Ladies and gentlemen please
welcome to the show Mr. Wolfman.

1:11:21.944 --> 1:11:23.362
You know that's your baby.

1:11:23.487 --> 1:11:28.534
You know that's your baby.
No, not possible.

1:11:28.909 --> 1:11:32.913
You need to admit that's your son
and start paying child support.

1:11:35.249 --> 1:11:37.376
No. No.

1:11:37.835 --> 1:11:39.837
That is not even mine.

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:43.090
I'm over 400 years old.

1:11:43.299 --> 1:11:44.633
It's not possible.

1:11:44.842 --> 1:11:49.263
Alright. Well, hey, Mr. Wolfman
we've got a little surprise for you.

1:11:49.888 --> 1:11:52.308
Let's bring up that
picture of baby Wolfgang.

1:11:52.516 --> 1:11:53.516
Bring it.

1:11:53.809 --> 1:11:56.353
Oh hell no.

1:11:57.271 --> 1:11:59.148
No way.

1:12:00.149 --> 1:12:01.900
Doesn't even look anything like me.

1:12:02.484 --> 1:12:04.820
What you think?

1:12:05.446 --> 1:12:06.822
Dude, that's your baby.

1:12:07.114 --> 1:12:09.408
Dude, that's your baby.

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:14.496
That's your baby. That's your baby.

1:12:14.663 --> 1:12:18.459
My friend here will tell
you that's not my baby.

1:12:18.625 --> 1:12:21.295
Alright. Well let's ask your buddy.

1:12:21.754 --> 1:12:23.589
Dracula, what do you think?

1:12:23.714 --> 1:12:25.841
Do you think that baby is his?

1:12:30.512 --> 1:12:33.265
I'm sorry man that's 100 your kid.

1:12:33.474 --> 1:12:37.561
- Oh well there you have it folks.
- There you have it.

1:12:37.770 --> 1:12:39.104
Seriously?

1:12:39.772 --> 1:12:41.899
I told you that was your baby.

1:12:42.191 --> 1:12:43.501
I told you that was your baby.

1:12:43.525 --> 1:12:44.860
No. No way.
That's your baby.

1:12:45.152 --> 1:12:52.368
That's your baby.

1:13:08.133 --> 1:13:12.096
The Wolfman hasn't gone to trial
but it's not looking good.

1:13:12.471 --> 1:13:15.516
The prosecutor's last name Vanhelsing.

1:13:17.226 --> 1:13:20.187
That's a bad sign.

1:13:21.772 --> 1:13:25.150
With wolfman being gone
we had to bring in a new roommate.

1:13:25.818 --> 1:13:27.403
The mummy decided to come join us.

1:13:31.156 --> 1:13:33.242
Freak

1:13:38.163 --> 1:13:40.249
Hairy bastard.

1:13:41.375 --> 1:13:43.919
She just keeps going.

1:13:45.462 --> 1:13:48.382
You got to be kidding me. Wolf man.

1:13:49.133 --> 1:13:49.800
Hate you.

1:13:50.134 --> 1:13:51.134
He's okay.

1:14:05.649 --> 1:14:06.775
Not again.

1:14:07.109 --> 1:14:08.694
Fucking. No.

1:14:25.502 --> 1:14:27.838
You are a lot faster.

1:14:35.554 --> 1:14:36.554
Careful.

1:15:03.165 --> 1:15:04.165
Freak.

1:15:07.419 --> 1:15:08.419
Really?

1:15:19.556 --> 1:15:21.683
What happened to my laptop?

1:15:28.524 --> 1:15:29.524
Frank.

1:15:34.071 --> 1:15:35.614
So are we done here?

1:15:36.698 --> 1:15:38.492
We're good. Good. Okay.

1:15:38.825 --> 1:15:41.286
Oh actually, uh, have
you seen our intern Eric?

1:15:42.496 --> 1:15:43.496
Who?

1:15:43.539 --> 1:15:46.375
Eric our intern he's been carrying
a lot of stuff on the set?

1:15:48.669 --> 1:15:50.921
No I can't say that I have.

1:16:26.748 --> 1:16:28.875
Hey I haven't seen Eric anywhere.
Have you?

1:16:29.167 --> 1:16:31.837
No, dude last time I checked
he was grabbing a quick bite.

1:16:32.129 --> 1:16:38.302
Gosh. Wait. What the…
No. No. No. No. Eric. Eric.

1:16:38.510 --> 1:16:42.681
Ouch Ouch. It hurts.

1:16:43.098 --> 1:16:51.098
Oh…uh-umm... oh.

1:17:38.528 --> 1:17:39.528
No.

1:17:39.696 --> 1:17:41.740
I will not surrender like this.

1:17:42.074 --> 1:17:44.159
My brother will not kill us.

1:17:44.534 --> 1:17:45.744
We will fight.

1:17:46.078 --> 1:17:47.746
Each story can be changed.

1:17:48.121 --> 1:17:49.331
You can add scenes.

1:17:49.498 --> 1:17:51.083
You can delete scenes.

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:52.501
Nothing is permanent.

1:17:52.918 --> 1:17:55.504
This story can have more
additions and versions.

1:17:55.879 --> 1:17:57.798
Who said this is the last version?

1:17:58.090 --> 1:18:01.093
I got it from the director
he asked me to learn my lines.

1:18:02.135 --> 1:18:03.136
Screw that.

1:18:03.512 --> 1:18:06.181
All my life I've wanted to avenge Judith.

1:18:06.682 --> 1:18:07.349
Who?

1:18:07.516 --> 1:18:09.559
Judith, my older sister.

1:18:10.268 --> 1:18:12.479
Michael killed her and she
was a role model for me.

1:18:13.230 --> 1:18:15.190
I kept it in my heart for too long.

1:18:15.565 --> 1:18:17.526
None of my friends are going to die today.

1:18:18.068 --> 1:18:19.486
We'll kill Michael.

1:18:20.278 --> 1:18:21.405
I'm not sure.

1:18:21.530 --> 1:18:22.531
I'm getting tired.

1:18:22.739 --> 1:18:25.492
I'm paying for 10 hours to be here so.

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:31.498
I still don't know
what you're talking about nor do I care.

1:18:31.707 --> 1:18:34.918
My brother is a monster and
we need to end this today.

1:18:35.335 --> 1:18:37.254
Jay daughter are you with me?

1:18:43.802 --> 1:18:44.402
Great.

1:18:44.553 --> 1:18:45.178
You.

1:18:45.470 --> 1:18:47.389
Person in the chair with no name.

1:18:47.556 --> 1:18:51.727
Well my name's Kristen Lunberg
and I'm a commercial actress.

1:18:51.935 --> 1:18:57.190
I've been in a few commercials here
and also stand up comedian,

1:18:57.315 --> 1:19:01.027
voice over actress and film festivals.

1:19:03.780 --> 1:19:05.657
Listen nobody cares.

1:19:05.866 --> 1:19:06.866
Are you with me?

1:19:07.117 --> 1:19:08.368
Is there more chicken?

1:19:09.369 --> 1:19:10.369
Yes.

1:19:10.871 --> 1:19:12.205
Okay I'm in.

1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:17.419
By the way, why did I have her
here for 30 days in my garage?

1:19:17.502 --> 1:19:21.339
Wouldn't it be easier to just pay
the lady for her voiceover service?

1:19:22.090 --> 1:19:26.720
She wanted a hundred dollars for her
voiceover service and I'm unemployed.

1:19:26.928 --> 1:19:30.766
Freddie didn't film anything new.
We don't have the money.

1:19:31.308 --> 1:19:32.642
You could just ask me.

1:19:32.851 --> 1:19:34.186
You're my friend.

1:19:34.394 --> 1:19:37.731
I would never ever, ever ask you for money.

1:19:38.148 --> 1:19:39.232
Yeah. That's true.

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:41.151
Now are you with us or not?

1:19:41.860 --> 1:19:43.111
It's a long day,

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:46.615
but yeah I'll stay with
you for an hour or two.

1:19:47.407 --> 1:19:48.407
That's the spirit.

1:20:10.222 --> 1:20:11.515
Can I have something too?

1:20:13.183 --> 1:20:17.187
You could but you might kill me for
keeping you here for so many days.

1:20:17.687 --> 1:20:18.855
Are you kidding me?

1:20:19.147 --> 1:20:21.983
You guys fed me well and
this is actually a pretty good gig.

1:20:22.275 --> 1:20:25.695
Other directors just pay after the shoot
or it's copy, credit, meal.

1:20:26.112 --> 1:20:29.491
Besides I really like this place and
I already got money for the gig so.

1:20:29.616 --> 1:20:31.493
Oh see…

1:20:32.327 --> 1:20:34.120
There's my direct deposit now.

1:20:35.914 --> 1:20:38.166
Okay. Good. Here.

1:20:41.503 --> 1:20:43.171
Happy killing Christina.

1:20:43.463 --> 1:20:45.173
Oh it's Kristen Lunberg.

1:20:45.549 --> 1:20:49.135
Sure. Whatever.
Let's just kill that bastard.

1:21:03.525 --> 1:21:05.694
He should be here any minute now.

1:21:06.486 --> 1:21:08.822
Traffic is heavy on the 405.

1:21:09.406 --> 1:21:12.325
He takes a pulveter or
just walks through the mountains.

1:21:13.159 --> 1:21:16.329
Yeah walking through
the mountains is sometimes faster.

1:21:16.705 --> 1:21:19.207
Shh... He's coming.

1:22:09.090 --> 1:22:12.802
Fuck.
I forgot eggs.

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:26.232
What? What just happened
why is he not coming in?

1:22:26.983 --> 1:22:29.569
He said, fuck, I forgot eggs.

1:22:31.404 --> 1:22:33.281
Wait. What did he say?

1:22:33.907 --> 1:22:37.160
He said, fuck, I forgot eggs.

1:22:38.203 --> 1:22:40.872
Oh my God these are his first words

1:22:42.707 --> 1:22:43.707
What?

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:45.710
He never said anything before.

1:22:45.919 --> 1:22:47.504
This is his first.

1:22:48.129 --> 1:22:49.714
So cute.

1:22:50.757 --> 1:22:53.301
So, we're not killing him?

1:22:55.053 --> 1:22:57.430
No, maybe some other time.

1:22:58.890 --> 1:23:01.226
I'm going to cry any second now.

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:05.313
Okay so what now?

1:23:06.773 --> 1:23:08.775
Maybe we could read another story?

1:23:09.317 --> 1:23:15.281
Fine. Why not? I'm paid for
the rest of the day so let's do it!
