WEBVTT

00:18.200 --> 00:21.320
-Now, sis! Do it! Do it now. Do it!
-All right!

00:23.480 --> 00:25.360
You all right?
Hey, you're gonna pop [indistinct].

00:25.840 --> 00:28.320
-[Kristy] What're you doing?
-[indistinct], look at her.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.800
If I had £1,000,
I'd buy Brazilian yaki hair like Beyonce,

00:33.880 --> 00:36.400
a lip reduction, red velvet cupcakes...

00:36.640 --> 00:38.400
probably a dustpan and brush
for this place.

00:38.480 --> 00:40.880
I mean, look at it, it's boring,
there's not even crime here.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.120
It's like some fake-ass estate,
it's like Diet Cola. It's diluted.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.800
Forget the dustpan,

00:45.880 --> 00:47.480
I'd buy a train ticket
and I'd just get out.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.520
Yeah, 'cause I'm tryin' to be something
worthwhile while I'm alive,

00:50.600 --> 00:51.600
you know what I mean?

00:51.680 --> 00:54.680
And these brick walls,
they're dragging me back, man.

00:54.760 --> 00:58.560
Yeah, I'm like a rose
trying to grow out of mud.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.400
I was born a big thinker,
I'm very wise.

01:01.480 --> 01:05.960
You know, my mind is bare agile.
I'm fast, you know what I mean?

01:06.040 --> 01:09.000
Got my ear to the ground,
so I'm alert at all times.

01:09.080 --> 01:10.160
Tracey!

01:10.560 --> 01:11.840
I ain't even bein' vain...

01:11.920 --> 01:13.040
Off we go.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.200
I just am special.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.280
Tracey!

01:16.920 --> 01:18.680
Just keep breathing.
Has your thing popped?

01:18.760 --> 01:20.160
-What?
-Idiot, man.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.160
All right, let's go and have a look.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.360
-[cop 1]It's fucking non-sense.
-[cop 2]Those bastards...

01:27.080 --> 01:29.200
[speaking gibberish]

01:30.920 --> 01:32.360
I'm a bit busy right now, you know.

01:34.880 --> 01:35.880
Oh!

01:37.120 --> 01:41.080
<i>♪ Life ain't so great, yeah</i>
<i>There'll be dots in the mud ♪</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:45.400
<i>♪ And life ain't honey</i>
<i>For any one of us ♪</i>

01:45.480 --> 01:49.400
<i>♪ If ever you're in doubt</i>

01:49.480 --> 01:52.560
♪ It's all right, darling
Get your wriggle on ♪

01:53.080 --> 01:54.800
<i>♪ Somewhere ♪</i>

01:57.360 --> 01:59.640
-Anything else?
-Uh, no, just the salad, thanks.

02:03.080 --> 02:06.360
-Is that-Is that Brazilian?
-I don't know.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.360
I'm not even sure.
I've lost count.

02:08.440 --> 02:10.080
They've practically
got their own wardrobe.

02:10.680 --> 02:11.680
It looks real.

02:12.280 --> 02:14.760
Thank you.
Wait, Tracey!

02:15.160 --> 02:17.520
We went to the same school.
I was a couple years below you.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.640
Meisha?

02:18.720 --> 02:20.120
Oh. Yeah, you all right?

02:20.200 --> 02:22.840
The big boss has me
running out buying coffees and salads

02:22.920 --> 02:24.080
every five minutes.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.160
-Wha-what do you--
-Oh, what don't I?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.560
Personal assistant to the boss,
marketing manager, sales exec,

02:29.640 --> 02:30.720
no sleep,

02:31.000 --> 02:33.040
but there are a shitload of perks.

02:33.120 --> 02:37.200
I don't like sleazy Stacey,
I like chocolate Tracey.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.920
I wanna lock her
in the boot of my car.

02:40.000 --> 02:43.400
I wanna drive her
beyond the most distant star.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.800
-Good hat.
-This is my boyfriend, Connor.

02:50.080 --> 02:54.680
-<i>Si</i>.
-You two look very cute together.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.040
I mean,
it's quite a new relationship.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.240
-What are you doin'?
-My mum wants it.

03:05.640 --> 03:08.400
Uh... so, uh, Connor,
what is it that you do?

03:08.480 --> 03:10.440
We were just talking jobs and stuff.

03:10.520 --> 03:13.000
-I'm a poet.
-Ha!

03:13.360 --> 03:15.120
Waste-man?
I've been there.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.600
[Meisha laughs]

03:16.680 --> 03:19.880
Listen, my boss is holding
a recruitment drive for the sales team,

03:20.320 --> 03:22.960
you should go down there,
you were always really nice.

03:23.240 --> 03:24.240
Here.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.080
[whispers] See ya.

03:28.600 --> 03:30.320
"Winsley Cosmetics."

03:31.600 --> 03:32.760
Bye.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.440
-Why?
-Police raided George the Giant's flat.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.680
'Left the door open, innit?
So we cleaned up.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.440
But why were these in his flat?

03:49.960 --> 03:51.720
So this is why
you couldn't cover my shift?

03:51.800 --> 03:52.960
Yeah.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.000
I'm gonna glue them together
and make a big one.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.240
I had to get my sister in.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.960
Cynthia?

04:08.120 --> 04:09.480
Next, please.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.840
Yeah, she'll be all right.

04:11.920 --> 04:12.960
[together] Yeah.

04:13.040 --> 04:15.080
I mean, 'cause I don't know
if I can go back, you know?

04:15.160 --> 04:18.440
Now I know I could go places,
if I--well, if I get it.

04:18.520 --> 04:19.680
Oh, of course you will, babe,

04:19.760 --> 04:22.000
that's why Meisha wants you
at the perfume recruitment today.

04:22.080 --> 04:25.160
Yeah, but she's not the big boss,
you know, the big boss, he's, like...

04:25.760 --> 04:26.800
he's big.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.640
-All right, I'll see you later.
-Where are you going?

04:29.720 --> 04:33.040
-To the recruitment.
-You gotta change, you silly bugger.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.440
I am changed.
This is what I'm wearing.

04:41.360 --> 04:42.720
[sirens wailing]

04:44.080 --> 04:47.800
Welcome to Winsley Cosmetics.
How are you doing, madam?

04:47.880 --> 04:49.600
Would you like to try
this nice perfume?

04:49.680 --> 04:52.000
This is actually
our latest release, yeah.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.280
Your husband will love this one.
Mine does.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.680
Welcome to Winsley Cosmetics.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.120
Whew!

04:58.200 --> 04:59.840
Hi, welcome to Winsley Cosmetics.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.360
Would you like to try this?

05:02.240 --> 05:05.000
He-hello, ma'a--
Perfume! Perfume!

05:05.080 --> 05:08.440
OK, so, um,
what we try to do at Winsley

05:08.520 --> 05:10.720
is, um, create an inviting atmosphere
for the clients.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.800
Mm-hmm.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.920
Oh, hello,
welcome to Winsley Cosmetics.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.960
Your husband will love me,
mine does.

05:18.080 --> 05:20.640
-No, I said that wrong.
-Uh... Uh...

05:20.720 --> 05:21.840
[clears throat]

05:21.920 --> 05:23.880
-What is it?
-Perfume.

05:24.360 --> 05:25.360
The brand?

05:27.080 --> 05:28.360
Oh, yeah. N, uh...

05:29.200 --> 05:32.480
yeah, it's called, uh,
"Yoonami Yodepumpum."

05:33.280 --> 05:36.240
-Ennemis Hairont.
-Yeah-me-hoho-yodo-poof-um-yum.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.600
-Ennemis Hairont--
-Oh, my God!

05:37.680 --> 05:39.400
You ain't even saying
the whole thing, though.

05:39.480 --> 05:41.160
"Ennemis Hairont <i>eau de parfum.</i>"

05:41.240 --> 05:43.200
Look, no one in this country
is gonna buy this.

05:43.280 --> 05:45.440
If it don't say perfume,
how they gonna know it's perfume?

05:48.040 --> 05:49.040
Good point.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.680
-I'll, um... I'll make a note of that.
-Cool.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.760
Uh... oh! A note to big boss?

05:54.360 --> 05:56.200
Yeah, you tell him Tracey said it.

05:56.480 --> 05:57.480
We'll be in touch.

06:00.520 --> 06:01.560
Smashed it.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.600
Fuck 'em, Jesus!

06:26.120 --> 06:29.840
I macked him in the ass,
stuck his cock in my fuckin' ear.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.680
Devil talks to me.

06:34.720 --> 06:37.680
Grog in my Jesus cock ear.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.760
I rinkeedink goo.

06:40.360 --> 06:42.640
I worship Satan.

06:43.120 --> 06:45.840
-Saboo!
-I will fear no evil.

06:45.920 --> 06:48.640
Mary is a whore of Joseph...

06:48.720 --> 06:51.400
-[Cynthia] And your staff will comfort me.
-and God is a whore.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.880
-Jesus Christ, hallelujah!
-And Satan burned him...

06:53.960 --> 06:56.720
-darkness of the fire legion.
-The blood of Jesus washes over this shop.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.440
-Get away from me!
-Legion! I am many!

06:58.520 --> 07:00.320
-Get away from me!
-I am many!

07:14.800 --> 07:16.560
Why would anyone
have this many dildos?

07:16.640 --> 07:20.080
This is a business opportunity.
Everything is worth a profit, yeah?

07:20.320 --> 07:22.000
I'm employed by Winsley Cosmetics.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.760
We are selling
this smelly cow dung in a box,

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
and people with fully working nostrils
are buyin' 'em.

07:25.920 --> 07:27.400
-So?
-So sell 'em.

07:27.640 --> 07:29.400
-To who?
-These lot! Yeah.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.240
Have a girls' night,
invite every woman on the estate,

07:32.320 --> 07:33.600
do all the pink stuff.

07:33.680 --> 07:37.520
-Some of them ain't fresh.
-They're used. They're second-hand.

07:38.040 --> 07:39.920
What? They ain't that bad, are they?

07:44.960 --> 07:47.800
-Wow!
-Yeah, AA batteries and STIs included.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.120
[Tracey] OK, well,

07:49.200 --> 07:51.640
as a business woman,
I can give you a business model.

07:51.720 --> 07:53.360
OK? Follow.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.800
You, the seller, have a problem.
150 dildos with BO.

07:56.880 --> 07:58.680
Seller-buyer problem, OK?

07:58.760 --> 08:01.200
Now what I could do
is go around the houses with footsie

08:01.280 --> 08:02.560
analyzing and diagrams,

08:02.640 --> 08:05.600
But what I propose to you... is this.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.560
Let's give the people
what they want, OK?

08:08.880 --> 08:12.320
It's an alternative penis,
and the most effective way...

08:12.400 --> 08:15.920
to solve getting rid
of the smell of the penis...

08:18.240 --> 08:19.800
is to wash them.

08:22.840 --> 08:23.960
Whew!

08:24.040 --> 08:26.360
I feel like I just wasted
two minutes of my whole life,

08:26.440 --> 08:27.440
and I can't get 'em back.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.280
Ew! Ugh...

08:33.520 --> 08:37.720
-Meisha!
-Wow, Tracey! Um, why are you here?

08:37.800 --> 08:39.760
-I was in the area.
-Oh, OK.

08:39.840 --> 08:42.080
But we normally wait
five to seven working days

08:42.160 --> 08:43.280
before we get back to people--

08:43.360 --> 08:45.760
I just wanted to know, should I
start buying clothes, like, what you wear?

08:45.840 --> 08:48.440
'Cause this is beginning to feel
like a lucky charm, you know 'I mean?

08:48.760 --> 08:53.320
OK, um, would you say that working
in sales is unnatural for you?

08:53.960 --> 08:55.960
Meisha, you know
that I used to work in a corner shop.

08:56.040 --> 08:58.240
Look, I can't do Wednesdays,
I'm project managing a dildo.

08:59.760 --> 09:03.000
OK. Unfortunately, you haven't been
selected for the next phase.

09:05.360 --> 09:07.640
Thank you so much
for your offer, really,

09:07.720 --> 09:09.120
but I'm going to have to decline.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.480
I'm sorry, I'm just looking for
something a bit more...

09:12.320 --> 09:14.040
good luck, though, and thank you.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.200
-You can go.
-Um, but I work here.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.080
-I don't care.
-No, but I'm an employee.

09:26.160 --> 09:27.200
Go over there, then.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.040
There.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.200
Well, I thought
you definitely stood out,

09:36.760 --> 09:38.040
which is, you know...

09:38.120 --> 09:39.240
important.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.080
But they're going to hire
the daughter of the boss' friend,

09:42.160 --> 09:43.160
they always were.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.640
I don't know why they
even bother with recruitments,

09:44.720 --> 09:46.000
it's all about
who you know, you know?

09:46.080 --> 09:49.520
-Yeah, well, I don't know anyone.
-Yeah, stepping stones and all that.

09:50.240 --> 09:52.400
So listen, you up for coming to
a work thing tonight?

09:52.480 --> 09:55.160
Posh do, swarming with execs,
worth your time?

09:56.120 --> 09:58.680
-No, I didn't get the job.
-Yeah, yeah... I'll sneak you in.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.480
Stepping stones and all that.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.440
Will big boss be there?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.680
Well, uh, I dunno if he'll be down
with this kinda shit

10:04.760 --> 10:06.240
but, yeah, he'll be there for defs.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.840
So what do we say?
Is that enough?

10:09.640 --> 10:12.240
-Well, what's that for?
-Mainly cocaine.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.280
I think Ned and Harriet
are partial to a bit of MDMA,

10:14.360 --> 10:16.840
a bit of the old mud-mer,
so chuck that in for good measure,

10:16.920 --> 10:19.560
but mainly the cocaine,
and what's your number?

10:20.680 --> 10:22.360
-My phone?
-Yeah, yeah.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.560
My old dealer got arrested
or murdered, or something.

10:24.640 --> 10:27.240
It's really quite sad,
and quite inconvenient, but, hey...

10:27.320 --> 10:29.240
Your old dealer?

10:29.320 --> 10:32.920
Oh, fuck a dog, my suit's ready.
Look, gotta dash.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.760
Great work today.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.200
Here's my card.
See you at krunk o'clock.

10:41.360 --> 10:42.640
Yeah, OK.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.520
He give me the cash,
and now, I think I've got a drug seller.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.240
So you'll be
their new friend with the cocaine?

10:52.320 --> 10:53.320
Yeah.

10:53.400 --> 10:57.040
Now, can I just carry it in my bag,
or should I eat the cocaine

10:57.120 --> 10:58.920
and then poo it out
when I get to the hotel?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
I've seen that on TV.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.640
I don't know.
I don't do cocaine, I'm black.

11:02.720 --> 11:05.560
Oh, you don't know Noah?
I've heard he's a drug lord.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.400
No one knows Noah.
That's why he's called that.

11:08.480 --> 11:09.600
He's a mystery, bruv.

11:09.680 --> 11:12.360
OK, well, you know what,
I'll just pop down there.

11:12.840 --> 11:15.840
"Pop down?"
This isn't a Minimart, you know.

11:16.280 --> 11:19.080
He's gangster,
he's got tattoos all over his face, blad.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.760
This innocent Bangladeshi immigrant,
you know,

11:21.840 --> 11:24.440
he had this Pizza Palace leaflet,
he put it through his letter box.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.280
-Do you know what he did to him?
-Yeah, I'm already terrified, Candice, OK?

11:27.360 --> 11:30.000
-I'm already terrified!
-He ate the nose off his face.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.880
I understand, OK?

11:32.520 --> 11:36.520
I've come this far, if I stop now,
I mean, I might as well die.

11:37.760 --> 11:39.400
If I'm not back by midnight,
call the police.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.240
And tell my mother I love her.

11:42.880 --> 11:45.160
That I was trying to live
the life she dreamed of,

11:45.240 --> 11:47.400
that I was just trying
to step on the stones.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.000
No.
No, you're not goin' alone.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.840
-I'm coming with you.
-Thank you.

11:53.920 --> 11:58.200
Listen, bitch! We tell 'im what we want,
and we never look him in the face.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.080
Keep your eyes
to the fucking floor, Trace.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.440
-No, not now.
-Sorry.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.560
This man is a beast.

12:06.000 --> 12:10.480
He can and will kill you
where you stand.

12:12.640 --> 12:14.840
Banoffee's always a hit and miss,
so if you don't like it--

12:14.920 --> 12:18.880
-Noah, this is superb.
-I'll show you, it's my own recipe.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.720
Shut up!

12:28.240 --> 12:31.120
Excuse me, sir?
Can we have the drugs, please?

12:31.480 --> 12:33.920
Oh, gosh! Have I not?

12:34.200 --> 12:35.920
Noah, you're lovely.

12:37.400 --> 12:38.760
What the hell?

12:38.840 --> 12:42.120
I know, blad.
And he's giving me the recipe.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.800
Right. Cocaine in here.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.040
MDMA in here. Speed and MDA.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.680
'Cause you've both been a treat.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.520
Come on, come on, come on.
Please! Let's go!

13:03.800 --> 13:07.240
You bet. Oh, excuse me.
Who's this? Ah.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.080
-Yeah, talk to me.
-<i>Hey, Josh, I'm outside.</i>

13:10.360 --> 13:11.720
[whistles]

13:11.800 --> 13:13.240
Excuse me, excuse me.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.840
No, not too much, you bell-end.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.960
You don't want any, do you?

13:28.040 --> 13:31.440
Nah, nah. No, I had some
for breakfast and lunch.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.040
-I am, I'm stuffed.
-Sweet. Sweet.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.160
Yeah.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.960
Ah! Pleasure doing business with you.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.960
A toast to our new working relationship?

13:41.760 --> 13:46.160
Oh, OK. I mean,
I haven't actually seen big boss yet.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.240
Who's going to give me my hours,
you know, like...

13:48.800 --> 13:51.680
I've already told Meisha
that I'm doing a dildo thing--

13:51.760 --> 13:53.640
It's not going to happen
overnight, is it?

13:53.880 --> 13:56.200
Stepping stones and all that.

13:56.960 --> 13:59.920
Oh, Tracey,
I am fucking pumped.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.760
-Chin-chin.
-Um, yeah, OK.

14:03.640 --> 14:04.640
Yeah.

14:08.400 --> 14:10.600
Mm! Mm! Mm! Mm-mm-mm-mm!

14:11.320 --> 14:13.200
That is disgusting.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.320
You've finished the whole thing.

14:15.840 --> 14:16.840
Uh...

14:17.560 --> 14:20.960
there's a little bit of backwash,
if you, uh... if you want it--

14:21.040 --> 14:23.760
Oh, fuck all the dogs.

14:24.160 --> 14:27.320
Yes, well, I didn't know
there was anything in there,

14:27.400 --> 14:29.560
so it was totally, like, not my fault.

14:29.640 --> 14:31.000
-Not mine neither.
-[Josh] No, no...

14:31.080 --> 14:33.040
-And the dogs.
-and, er, stepping stones.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.160
Stepping stones.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.520
-Well, it was very nice to meet you.
-I like you. I will...

14:37.800 --> 14:40.120
-Get out.
-She drank the whole thing.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.640
Yeah! Yeah, OK, then,
I'll come with you guys.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.760
Sexy ladies, queens, princesses,
you are about to experience

14:57.840 --> 15:01.720
the night of your fucking lives,
better than any Ann Summers party.

15:01.800 --> 15:02.800
[people cheering]

15:02.880 --> 15:05.360
A special presentation.

15:05.560 --> 15:06.600
Wooh!

15:07.240 --> 15:10.520
Well, ho-ho-ho,
it's fucking Christmas.

15:11.920 --> 15:13.000
Oh, Jesus!

15:13.080 --> 15:15.320
-Do you wanna get this done? Perfect.
-Yes.

15:16.440 --> 15:17.520
Meisha!

15:17.960 --> 15:20.880
-Tracey. You're here as well.
-Yeah.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.800
-Why?
-It's hot in here. Josh snuck me in.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.400
Josh? I thought you had a boyfriend.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.160
Yeah, um... I do.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.120
My mouth is dry.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.480
Oh, I bought Josh the cocaine.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.960
Isn't that how you got the job as well?

15:35.640 --> 15:37.240
-No.
-I have...

15:38.040 --> 15:39.760
I think I've been a bit silly.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.360
Well, that's disappointing.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.520
Meisha, I just wanted it so badly.
I was desperate, yeah?--

15:44.600 --> 15:45.880
-Tracey--
-I was desperate, Meisha.

15:45.960 --> 15:49.200
People like us,
we have to be twice as alert.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.480
Opportunities are never just gonna be
handed to us on silver sp...

15:54.800 --> 15:56.040
What are you doing?

15:59.960 --> 16:01.680
Have you taken something?

16:01.760 --> 16:03.840
[gasps] OK, come with me,
you need to get out of here.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.480
Oh!

16:25.600 --> 16:27.400
It's big boss. Yeah.

16:29.520 --> 16:32.080
Big boss.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.800
Fuckin' hell, I'll tell you what,
I've had more fake orgasms

16:36.880 --> 16:38.720
than I've had Cornish pasties.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.800
And I've had a lot of Cornish pasties.

16:41.240 --> 16:45.640
Honestly though, most times,
I just wanna be alone and ride pillow.

16:45.720 --> 16:48.200
-Ride it, ride it, ride it.
-Ride it.

16:48.880 --> 16:50.480
Hey, the worst one, yeah, is,

16:50.560 --> 16:54.200
"How many times did I make you come?"
Like, make me?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.800
Yeah, yeah, as if they give it to you.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.120
I mean, I might climax
if you stop generically pounding

16:58.200 --> 16:59.880
my ass like hammer on a nail.

17:00.360 --> 17:02.000
Some of the stuff
I've seen men get off on,

17:02.080 --> 17:03.800
I'm like,
"Are you fucking delusional?"

17:03.880 --> 17:05.720
They are delusional. They are.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.400
"Ah, baby, are you gonna squirt
for me one day?"

17:08.480 --> 17:11.840
Them bitches in them videos
are pissing, it's just piss.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.000
-Like actual urine.
-Oh, wow!

17:14.080 --> 17:15.200
[Ola] Them girls are lucky,

17:15.280 --> 17:18.040
my fudge is as dry
as a fucking Ryvita.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.160
Nan!

17:19.240 --> 17:20.880
[ladies laughing]

17:21.960 --> 17:24.840
Where there are no goals,
there is no hope.

17:25.680 --> 17:29.200
Where there is no future,
there is no future.

17:29.560 --> 17:34.000
Winsley Cosmetics is the future
and I am so proud of...

17:36.160 --> 17:37.200
Yeah.

17:43.440 --> 17:46.240
I'm Tracey and I wanna say a few words.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.440
I used to wanna be in you lot's gang...

17:50.040 --> 17:52.600
but now I see this lifestyle
for what it really is.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.040
It's just greed.

17:54.560 --> 17:55.920
It's just money.

17:56.240 --> 18:00.480
I mean, wouldn't you rather have friends
and people that love you, I would.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.440
Instead of a bunch of people
who judge me.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.400
I mean, none of you know
what I am capable of.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.800
None of you know me,
you just think you do.

18:07.880 --> 18:11.640
And it's pathetic the way you judge me.
It's pathetic.

18:12.360 --> 18:16.880
But at the same time,
I do really feel like we really get on.

18:16.960 --> 18:18.560
[speaking gibberish]

18:21.280 --> 18:23.520
[speaking gibberish]

18:28.440 --> 18:29.560
Oh, big boss.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.360
Eebeeboh! Oh, wow!

18:32.840 --> 18:34.520
-[Tracey] Wow!
-Oh, my God!

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
-[Meisha] Tracey
-Mm?

18:36.640 --> 18:38.160
Tracey, Tracey.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.360
You're having a bad trip.

18:42.960 --> 18:44.400
There's gonna be an attack,

18:44.480 --> 18:47.000
Uh, there's gonna be a terrorist attack,
the biggest--

18:47.080 --> 18:50.880
Listen to me because this is important.
It is not the Muslims.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.320
It's the people of Scotland.

18:53.600 --> 18:57.280
But all the CCTV is in the mosques,
so we're never gonna catch them.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.280
No, you need to get a cab.

19:02.560 --> 19:03.680
Kiss me.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.560
You did it!

19:06.640 --> 19:07.680
Yeah.

19:16.320 --> 19:18.320
Ladies and gentlemen,
the highlight of the evening.

Jesus!

19:38.520 --> 19:41.240
Yes! Oh, my God!

20:05.920 --> 20:07.720
What's wrong with you?
They're used, man?

20:09.520 --> 20:11.760
-They're used?
-Ugh!

20:12.320 --> 20:14.480
-Argh! Argh!
-What a shame!

20:15.160 --> 20:17.480
-Are you taking the piss?
-I want my tenner back.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.440
Stick your dildo.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.800
An absolute shame.

20:22.360 --> 20:24.200
-Disgusting.
-Disgusting.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.480
[man] Can you imagine it?

20:26.960 --> 20:28.080
Seriously.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.560
[Tracey] Home!

20:33.360 --> 20:34.440
Wow!

20:36.600 --> 20:38.800
It's like a palace.

20:42.600 --> 20:43.760
It's tall.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.040
Bricks!

20:46.440 --> 20:48.840
[gasps] Stairs.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.040
Stepping stones!

20:54.640 --> 20:56.360
You're amazing.

20:57.640 --> 21:01.160
Oh, you guys are so, so amazing.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.000
Mummy.

21:06.280 --> 21:07.800
[operatic music]

21:25.200 --> 21:26.360
I love you.

21:28.560 --> 21:30.720
I know I've never said
that before, but...

21:32.000 --> 21:33.000
I do.

Oh, minions of Satan,
I command you, leave her.

22:14.400 --> 22:17.480
-Exit her! Erupt through her mouth.
-So slee--

22:17.560 --> 22:21.240
Leave her body, exit!
Erupt through her mouth.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.160
Out, vile demon.

That's nice.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.440

There we go.
Yes.

-Bye-bye.
