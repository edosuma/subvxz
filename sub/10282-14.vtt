WEBVTT

00:05.139 --> 00:06.340
Previously on ER...

00:06.374 --> 00:07.408
Who's that?

00:07.441 --> 00:08.542
LEWIS:
Med student.

00:08.576 --> 00:09.710
Jane, why didn't you
say anything?

00:09.743 --> 00:12.213
No one listens to me.

00:12.246 --> 00:14.048
No one even remembers
I was in the room.

00:14.082 --> 00:15.783
Third year resident, I've
been ordering my own scans

00:15.816 --> 00:17.585
since I been here.
What's that about?

00:17.618 --> 00:19.420
It's about me
making the rules.

00:19.453 --> 00:20.821
Come on, that's stupid.

00:20.854 --> 00:23.524
Congratulations, Jake.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.694
Your ER rotation
is officially over.

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.897 --> 01:06.200
Good evening.

01:06.234 --> 01:08.336
Can I help you?

01:23.717 --> 01:25.153
Room 415?

01:25.153 --> 01:25.753
End of the hall.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.696
Helen?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.767
Helen, it's Kerry.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.374
I don't want to leave it
like this.

01:48.509 --> 01:51.745
The things that we said...

01:51.779 --> 01:53.314
Is this how you
want to leave it?

01:53.347 --> 01:54.548
If it is, tell me,
and I'll go away...

01:54.582 --> 01:56.450
like we never even met.

02:54.942 --> 02:55.943
I heard it was
supposed to be sunny

02:55.976 --> 02:57.511
and slightly warmer today.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.313
I heard "partly cloudy,
chance of rain."

02:59.347 --> 03:00.314
Winter.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.285
Did you know
that most snowflakes

03:04.318 --> 03:05.619
are less than
one-half inch across?

03:05.653 --> 03:06.720
Uh, no, I didn't...

03:06.754 --> 03:07.988
Do you know
why they're white?

03:08.021 --> 03:09.823
The complex structure
of snow crystals

03:09.857 --> 03:12.293
results in countless
tiny surfaces

03:12.326 --> 03:14.728
from which visible light
is efficiently reflected.

03:14.762 --> 03:16.330
What little sunlight
is absorbed

03:16.364 --> 03:18.266
is absorbed uniformly
over the visible wavelengths

03:18.299 --> 03:20.634
thus giving snow
its white appearance.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.869
What's wrong with you?
( laughs )

03:23.771 --> 03:24.772
Alex had a school report.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.407
Luka and I got
kind of into it.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.975
Yeah, guess so.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.411
Excuse me...

03:30.444 --> 03:32.813
Do you know how much longer
I'll have to wait?

03:32.846 --> 03:35.849
Ooh, that's nasty.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.385
One of the other skaters
ripped into me.

03:37.418 --> 03:38.452
This morning?

03:38.486 --> 03:39.820
Skating club.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.689
We only get the ice
from 5:30 to 7:00.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.691
We'll get you checked in
in a couple of
minutes, okay?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.858
Thanks.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.994
Ugh, winter.

03:47.027 --> 03:49.330
So it's already an
every-night kind of thing?

03:49.363 --> 03:51.299
Since he started his
surgical rotation, yeah.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.800
Dubenko's working him
pretty hard,

03:52.833 --> 03:54.635
and my place is closer
to the hospital.

03:54.668 --> 03:57.905
Oh, I see, so sleeping over
is basically a convenience.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.973
No, we do like
each other.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.542
And, do you know, his
real name isn't Jake,

04:01.575 --> 04:02.743
it's George?

04:02.776 --> 04:04.378
It's actually kind
of a funny story.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.714
I mean, it's not funny-
funny, but it's... sorry.

04:06.747 --> 04:09.383
Tibial plateau fracture,
ortho's taking to the OR.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.485
Make sure he's NPO.
Got it.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.920
Cellulitis following cat bite,
admit to medicine.

04:12.953 --> 04:13.954
Already did.

04:13.987 --> 04:15.022
Antibiotics on board?

04:15.055 --> 04:16.524
Three grams of unasyn.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.992
DKA on an insulin drip,
going up to the ICU.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.594
Last glucose?

04:20.628 --> 04:23.864
534. And they just brought
back a 60-year-old lady,

04:23.897 --> 04:25.366
Pick's Disease
with agitation.

04:25.399 --> 04:25.999
I'm officially
out of here.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.701
Thank you, Luka.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.437
Hasta la vista,
suckers.
Dr. Barnett.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.938
Ray, when you get home,
take the back stairs,

04:30.971 --> 04:32.606
front ones are kind of frozen.

04:32.640 --> 04:33.607
You didn't shovel?

04:33.641 --> 04:35.075
You're kidding, right?

04:35.108 --> 04:37.511
Oh, and the kitchen window,

04:37.545 --> 04:38.546
I couldn't get it
to close all the way.

04:38.579 --> 04:39.780
Meaning?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.682
Meaning there's snow
in the kitchen.

04:41.715 --> 04:43.517
Bit of a build-up,
actually, so you
might want to try

04:43.551 --> 04:45.085
turning the oven on
and leaving the door open.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.554
So it'll melt.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.755
It's just a suggestion.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.724
She used to be my roommate.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.460
WEAVER:
Shall we get back
to medicine here?

04:52.493 --> 04:55.496
Atypical chest pain
waiting on a second troponin.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.797
I'll take it.
How come Weaver's on?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.499
How come Weaver's on?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.568
She does two shifts a month
to keep up her skills,

05:00.601 --> 05:02.370
to stay in touch with
the needs of the department.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.637
Our lucky day.

05:03.671 --> 05:04.872
Teenage ice skater
bleeding like a stuck pig

05:04.905 --> 05:05.939
out in the waiting area.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.107
Frank, let's get
a wheelchair.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.576
Okay.
Someone might want

05:08.609 --> 05:10.544
to grab the trauma
at the back door.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.980
Carter, take Neela with you
on that chest pain.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.816
Susan, 50-something woman,
dyspnea, curtain four.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.485
Abby, Jane, you're with me.

05:19.487 --> 05:20.821
Must be awkward for Dr. Lewis,

05:20.854 --> 05:22.490
being chief, then having
Dr. Weaver back.

05:22.523 --> 05:24.024
What, are you kidding?

05:24.057 --> 05:26.494
Weaver comes in, takes
charge, runs all the cases.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.562
Lewis loves it.
It's like having a day off.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.531
Not so, however,
for the rest of us.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.932
Altercation at someone's

05:31.965 --> 05:33.767
all-night-turned-out-badly
birthday party.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.669
Good morning, Dr. Pratt.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.738
Yeah, half an inch of snow
and traffic grinds to a halt.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.807
Multiple stab wounds
to the back with
a screwdriver.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.974
You think he
dropped a lung?
Probably not,

05:41.008 --> 05:42.075
sats are 100.

05:42.109 --> 05:43.611
Abby and I have
got this one.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.479
There's a woman there
with Pick's Disease.

05:45.513 --> 05:46.680
Why don't you grab that.

05:46.714 --> 05:47.848
Oh, and take Jane with you.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.417
It's a good
teaching case.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.051
I'm sure Jane has seen
more than her share

05:51.084 --> 05:52.720
of combative patients
with dementia.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.887
But not with you
as her teacher.

05:53.921 --> 05:54.988
Have you, Jane?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.924
You could start by
reviewing

05:56.957 --> 05:58.559
the key elements
of the history,

05:58.592 --> 06:00.661
physical, genetics,
differences from Alzheimer's.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.929
Okay, okay, we're on it.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.764
If it's any consolation,

06:03.797 --> 06:06.166
I'm a blank slate when
it comes to Pick's Disease.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.503
I know we studied it
maybe first year.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.572
No, I think
it was second year.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.441
No, it was first year.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.776
What did she say
about Alzheimer's?

06:15.809 --> 06:17.945
Man, talk about your
short-term memory loss.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.713
Lousy son-of-a...

06:19.747 --> 06:21.682
I'll get a piece,
you stupid fat piece of sh...

06:21.715 --> 06:22.983
Nice language.
Equal breath sounds.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.752
Pulse ox 98.
First hemocue?

06:24.785 --> 06:25.953
13.8.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.488
Okay, let's roll him.

06:27.521 --> 06:29.923
We're going to roll you
onto your side, sir.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.825
No head injury.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.461
Guess he's
sleeping it off.

06:33.494 --> 06:34.595
Regular or Phillips head?

06:34.628 --> 06:35.896
What?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.498
Stabbed with a
screwdriver, right?

06:37.531 --> 06:39.833
Yes. At least 20 wounds,
all superficial.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.569
I'd say regular.

06:41.602 --> 06:43.036
Sonosite.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.172
Mr. Scanlon, what
is Hamman's sign?
Uh...

06:45.205 --> 06:46.974
A crunching sound heard
with pneumomediastinum,

06:47.007 --> 06:47.975
listen for it.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.209
TAGGART:
X-ray's back.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.711
What is normal
intrapleural pressure?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.112
Negative...

06:52.145 --> 06:54.081
Negative ten to 12 millimeters
of mercury.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.716
And what's the intra-alveolar
pressure?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.718
Fluctuates.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.787
Minus three with inspiration,
plus three with expiration.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.489
So, Jake, tell me:

07:01.522 --> 07:03.524
How does this poor guy
end up with a pneumothorax?

07:03.557 --> 07:06.960
Penetrating trauma allows air
to enter the pleural space,

07:06.994 --> 07:09.997
raising the pressure,
collapsing the alveoli.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.499
Well done, Mr. Scanlon.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.733
Fantastic.

07:12.766 --> 07:13.934
BP 124/82.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.035
Let's get him a floor bed.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.837
He needs the ICU.
He's stable.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.139
No, the guy's Swiss cheese.
He needs close observation.

07:19.172 --> 07:20.107
We'll never get an ICU bed.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.709
He doesn't need one,

07:21.742 --> 07:23.644
no pneumo, his crit
and vitals are stable,

07:23.677 --> 07:25.513
no blood in
the pericardium
or Morrison's.

07:25.513 --> 07:26.780
He could have an occult
solid organ injury

07:26.814 --> 07:27.981
or a delayed pneumothorax.

07:28.015 --> 07:28.916
Are you going
to bludgeon us

07:28.949 --> 07:30.183
with the differential?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.152
Occasionally,
I can be thorough.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.587
How about a tele admit?

07:33.621 --> 07:34.555
Maybe after four hours.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.756
Four hours?

07:35.789 --> 07:38.091
Uh, Kerry,
that lady with dyspnea,

07:38.125 --> 07:39.192
Sharon Williams,

07:39.226 --> 07:40.761
she's asking for you.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.162
Said she here before,
you were her doc.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.897
Okay. This "Swiss cheese"
is stable.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.700
Let's get him admitted
to a med-surg bed

07:46.734 --> 07:49.770
and don't listen to any of
Dr. Dubenko's suggestions.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.004
So, Dr. Lewis...

07:51.038 --> 07:52.139
Don't start.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.641
Oh, okay.
No problem.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.242
We humble surgical servants

07:55.275 --> 07:57.044
shall leave this
in your capable hands.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.580
Uh, Jake...
do not move

07:59.613 --> 08:01.014
Mr. Screwdriver
without a foley,

08:01.048 --> 08:04.652
an NG, three crits and
a four-hour chest film.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.954
Oh, and suture
all the lacs.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.055
All 20 of them?

08:08.088 --> 08:09.222
Oh, yeah.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.027
Sharon Williams, BP 124/70,

08:14.061 --> 08:15.162
pulse ox 90.

08:15.195 --> 08:17.164
No history of asthma
or emphysema.

08:17.197 --> 08:18.899
Thanks, Haleh.
Sharon Williams?

08:18.932 --> 08:20.267
You're Dr. Weaver?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.636
I'm sorry, of course
you're Dr. Weaver.

08:22.670 --> 08:23.671
You were in once before?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.238
Yes.
And when was that?

08:25.272 --> 08:27.775
Oh, God, let me think.

08:27.808 --> 08:29.309
I don't know,
I can't quite remember.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.011
You know, I'm actually
feeling much better now.

08:32.044 --> 08:33.246
I probably didn't
need to come in.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.682
Well, as long as you did...

08:34.715 --> 08:36.082
Well, I don't...

08:36.116 --> 08:37.250
This whole thing
is silly.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.818
I don't know
what I was thinking.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.220
I'm much better,
I'm breathing fine.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.855
Why don't you
let me examine you

08:41.889 --> 08:43.724
and we'll make sure of that.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.893
Okay, you said you experienced
shortness of breath?

08:45.926 --> 08:47.094
Yes.

08:47.127 --> 08:49.162
Any cough or fever?
No.

08:49.196 --> 08:53.100
Have you had any
prolonged periods
of immobilization

08:53.133 --> 08:54.802
like a plane or car trip?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.336
No.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.740
Lungs sound good,
oxygen level is fine.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.875
We'll check a few tests
and see what's going on.

09:01.909 --> 09:05.713
Haleh, EKG, PA and
lateral chest, D-dimer.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.047
Sure.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.315
And I'll be back
to check on you later.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.617
Dr. Weaver.

09:09.617 --> 09:10.618
Yeah?

09:12.653 --> 09:14.087
Is there something
you need?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.322
No, no.

09:15.355 --> 09:18.291
Well, yes...

09:18.325 --> 09:19.793
It's not really
important.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.228
What's not important?

09:21.261 --> 09:23.764
Well, I was wondering,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.733
the daughter
of a friend of mine

09:25.766 --> 09:27.768
is thinking about
medical school.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.637
Do you like
what you do?

09:29.670 --> 09:30.971
Very much.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.305
Did you always want
to be a doctor?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
From when I was a little girl.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.810
So you were lucky,
then, weren't you?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.279
Getting the
opportunity to do it.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.782
Ms. Williams,
is everything all right?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.216
Oh, I'm fine, Kerry.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.151
Really.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.853
Thank you.

09:45.886 --> 09:47.955
I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

09:47.988 --> 09:49.156
Okay then.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.995
Sharon Williams,

09:55.028 --> 09:57.731
let's pull up her records
from the last time she was in.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.132
Sure.

10:03.336 --> 10:05.639
Can you wiggle
your fingers?

10:05.673 --> 10:08.809
Can you wiggle
your fingers?

10:08.842 --> 10:10.243
Why don't you just
give it a try for me?

10:10.277 --> 10:12.412
Why don't you just
give it a try for me.

10:12.445 --> 10:13.647
Charlotte,

10:13.681 --> 10:15.148
Charlotte, the dinner party.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.684
The dinner party,
they're going to be here early.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.218
It's okay, Mom.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.087
What are we going to do?
It's okay.
Mom, it's okay.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.255
5:30 this morning
I hear her

10:22.289 --> 10:23.323
crashing around
in the kitchen.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.158
You got a bathroom
around here?

10:25.192 --> 10:27.828
Chuny...
Mrs. Devon, you
can come with me.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.429
You can come with me.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.630
With me.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.333
There is no
dinner party.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.835
She was in the kitchen.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.369
She thought she was
cutting chicken...

10:36.403 --> 10:38.305
she was cutting her own hand.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.340
Well, we're gonna take
care of that.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.009
When did her symptoms start?

10:42.042 --> 10:44.011
Two years ago.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.846
She was only 58.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.281
We've been able to keep
her at home, but now

10:48.315 --> 10:49.950
I've got three kids.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.152
What am I supposed to do?

10:55.856 --> 10:57.090
WEAVER:
Labs back yet
on that syncope?

10:57.124 --> 10:58.826
No. still waiting.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.393
Call them again
and ask nicely.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.229
"Nicely"? We're never nicely.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.864
Pratt, Pick's Disease?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.465
Jane?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.300
Uh, similarities
with Alzheimer's,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.002
but with an earlier
age of onset

11:09.036 --> 11:10.971
and a faster progression
of symptoms.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.139
Mainly causes damage

11:12.172 --> 11:13.240
to the frontal lobes
of the brain

11:13.273 --> 11:14.908
resulting in disinhibition.

11:14.942 --> 11:17.945
Patient can be extremely
rude, which we have seen,

11:17.978 --> 11:20.080
and then can become
extremely loving,

11:20.113 --> 11:21.181
which we have not seen.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.449
Uh, often has a tendency

11:22.482 --> 11:23.984
to repeat statements
spoken to them,

11:24.017 --> 11:25.853
you know, but I'd actually
say it's a bit more...

11:25.886 --> 11:27.054
Thank you, Jane.
Good job, good job.

11:27.087 --> 11:30.190
Yes, and let me see--

11:30.223 --> 11:31.992
was that Dr. Pratt's
extremely efficient teaching

11:32.025 --> 11:32.926
or was it...

11:34.027 --> 11:36.263
"eMedicine."

11:36.296 --> 11:38.065
She learned about it,
didn't she?

11:38.098 --> 11:40.100
She learned the facts,

11:40.133 --> 11:42.502
not necessarily how to handle
the patients or the family.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.204
Yeah, but she will.
The woman's got
some lacerations.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.438
We're going to suture her as
soon as the Ativan kicks in.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.439
Dr. Pratt said that...

11:46.473 --> 11:48.375
What about the family?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.177
The daughter's trying to line
up a skilled nursing facility.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.444
You should help her with that.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.113
Isn't that
a social worker thing?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.214
Just dive in.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.849
See what you can do.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.384
Hey, Sam, did that
screwdriver stabbing guy

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
get sent upstairs yet?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.089
Uh, well, Dr. Dubenko
wanted a few things
taken care of first.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.359
In what possible universe

12:06.393 --> 12:08.962
would I say the words,
"Let's polka"?

12:08.996 --> 12:10.497
I'm telling you, in
your sleep two nights ago.

12:10.530 --> 12:11.799
Look, I'm not making
this up.

12:11.832 --> 12:13.033
You don't think
I was surprised?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.467
I don't talk in my sleep.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.836
How do you know?

12:15.869 --> 12:17.504
Even if I did,
I wouldn't say "polka."

12:17.537 --> 12:19.406
I wouldn't even say "dance."
I don't dance.

12:19.439 --> 12:21.274
I mean, maybe once when
I was a kid I did the limbo.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.309
Yeah, maybe that was it.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.144
Maybe it was the limbo.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.146
Ah, see? And you're
making it up.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.148
( both laughing )

12:28.181 --> 12:30.217
I'm sorry!

12:30.250 --> 12:31.251
Dr. Lockhart.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.452
Mr. Scanlon.

12:32.485 --> 12:33.453
Kerry.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.454
Dr. Weaver.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.425
...um, mixing up
some Ancef.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.894
I'm just gathering
up supplies, so...

12:40.928 --> 12:42.462
I thought you were
gathering up

12:42.495 --> 12:45.198
a med-surg bed for the guy
with holes in his back.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.067
I'd like very much
to do that.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.203
Dr. Weaver. That patient,
Sharon Williams?

12:50.237 --> 12:51.438
There's no record of
her being here before.

12:51.471 --> 12:52.973
I asked her about it

12:53.006 --> 12:54.942
and she got pretty nervous.
Wants to leave AMA.

12:54.975 --> 12:56.910
Now?
Yeah.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.317
"Gathering supplies"?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.053
Yeah. I know. Okay. I know.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.327
Excuse me. Uh, that
woman who was here.

13:14.361 --> 13:15.462
Did you see her leave?

13:15.495 --> 13:16.563
Yeah, just now.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.065
Kind of bolted.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.167
You want me to try
and catch her?

13:25.038 --> 13:27.074
Ms. Williams.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.408
Please wait.

13:28.441 --> 13:29.877
Your test results
aren't back yet.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.011
I don't need 'em.

13:31.044 --> 13:31.611
It shouldn't be
much longer.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.080
I don't need 'em.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.915
You could have
a blood clot in the lung

13:34.948 --> 13:36.216
or fluid around
your heart.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.185
Stop, please.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.519
I don't have any
of those things,

13:39.552 --> 13:40.888
There's nothing
wrong with me.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.089
I don't understand.

13:45.625 --> 13:48.561
I've never been
to this hospital before.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.331
My name's not
Sharon Williams.

13:51.364 --> 13:53.166
It's... Helen Kingsley.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.534
I'm your mother.

13:54.567 --> 13:56.904
WEAVER:
Who'd you say, Kovac?

14:03.076 --> 14:05.012
Yeah. His wanting Saturday off
is potentially a problem.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.246
Well, however
you want to handle it.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.647
Kerry, they can take
Sharon Williams

14:07.680 --> 14:08.949
for her chest x-ray now.

14:08.982 --> 14:10.317
That won't be necessary.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.484
You can cancel
her labs, too.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.619
Cancel all of it?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.254
Yeah.
Kerry, about earlier...

14:14.287 --> 14:17.024
Susan, could you follow up
on this migraine in Two?

14:17.057 --> 14:18.926
I know we were supposed to take
the screwdriver guy upstairs.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.327
Don't worry about it.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.095
Dubenko wanted serial
crits and the UA

14:22.129 --> 14:23.196
showed 10 red cells.

14:23.230 --> 14:24.364
Do we need to work that up?

14:24.397 --> 14:25.498
That's probably just
from the foley.

14:25.532 --> 14:26.533
So he doesn't need a CT?

14:26.566 --> 14:27.634
Frank, I'm gonna take a break.

14:27.667 --> 14:28.435
What?!

14:30.137 --> 14:31.371
"Break"?

14:38.011 --> 14:41.181
Well... they say it isn't
good for your arteries.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.416
I guess you'd
know about that.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.452
But I like it anyway.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.387
How did you find me?

14:47.420 --> 14:49.622
The letter you sent.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.324
But that was four years ago.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.026
Why-Why all this pretense?

14:53.060 --> 14:54.494
Why didn't you
just write back?

14:54.527 --> 14:56.296
I wanted to see you first.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.600
That poor little
ice skater girl.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.002
Her leg looked awful.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.636
She's young. She'll heal.

15:03.670 --> 15:08.108
What you do,
it's so important.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.676
I guess I was scared.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.045
I'm here in Chicago

15:12.079 --> 15:13.080
for a week, so...

15:13.113 --> 15:15.348
You're still in Indiana?

15:15.382 --> 15:16.283
Terre Haute.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.985
That's next door.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.987
You could've been
to Chicago a hundred times.

15:19.987 --> 15:21.521
I'm sorry.

15:21.554 --> 15:24.324
I looked for you.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.492
I hired an investigator.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.327
I finally found
the right address,

15:27.360 --> 15:30.197
you knew where I was and,
still, you waited so long?

15:30.230 --> 15:32.032
I can't explain it.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.401
I know it wasn't fair.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.169
I'm truly,
truly sorry.
Oh, plea... please.

15:36.203 --> 15:38.371
Please. Don't go yet.

15:46.713 --> 15:50.350
So, um... have you
always lived in Indiana?

15:53.720 --> 15:56.323
South Carolina, originally.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.358
I'm here in Chicago
with my choir.

15:58.391 --> 15:59.626
Your choir?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.328
There's a Christ Crusade

16:01.361 --> 16:05.065
and we were chosen to sing
in the festival chorus.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.100
That... that sounds
like quite an honor.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.435
When's the concert?

16:08.468 --> 16:10.170
Tomorrow afternoon,

16:10.203 --> 16:11.404
Community Baptist
on Dearborn.

16:11.438 --> 16:13.173
Oh... as a matter of fact,

16:13.206 --> 16:14.207
they're going to be
looking for me.

16:14.241 --> 16:15.075
We've got a rehearsal.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.444
Um...

16:17.477 --> 16:21.214
I'd like to talk
to you again, Kerry.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.115
If you want to, that is.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.416
Yeah, I would.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.518
So I can call you
after I'm done?

16:25.552 --> 16:27.087
Do you have the number
of the hospital?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.121
No.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.190
Just wait one second.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.391
There's a separate number

16:31.424 --> 16:32.492
for the ER.

16:34.427 --> 16:36.363
Uh... one second.

16:39.432 --> 16:43.770
Here you go.
There you are.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.238
So you'll call.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.206
In a couple of hours.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.075
Great.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.112
Pressure's only 72 palp.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.380
Left pupil
is 6 millimeters

16:53.413 --> 16:54.247
and sluggish.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.515
Hang 80
of mannitol.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.084
Multiple rib fractures
with sub q air.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.751
Glove up for a chest tube.

16:58.785 --> 17:01.421
So, our drunk vs. screwdriver
is having some more trouble?

17:01.454 --> 17:04.257
This isn't the screwdriver guy.

17:04.290 --> 17:07.227
Oh, I heard he was still down
here, so naturally I assumed

17:07.260 --> 17:08.761
there was some
emergent situation.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.198
No. This would be
the motorcycle vs. tree guy.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.464
Blunt head, chest...

17:12.499 --> 17:14.267
Looks like a fractured spleen.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.469
Mr. Scanlon, your
patient's bleeding

17:16.502 --> 17:18.137
in the head and belly.
What's your plan?

17:18.171 --> 17:22.275
Uh... quick head CT before going
to the OR for an exlap.

17:22.309 --> 17:25.412
Good call if you want him
to bleed out in the scanner.

17:25.444 --> 17:27.847
Betadine and steri-drape.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.150
What's the Monroe-Kelly
hypothesis?

17:30.183 --> 17:31.284
Uh, I don't know.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.585
Abby?

17:35.322 --> 17:37.124
I don't know.

17:37.157 --> 17:40.127
CPP equals MAP minus ICP.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.129
Cerebral Perfusion Pressure
equals Mean Arterial Pressure

17:42.129 --> 17:44.164
minus Intracranial Pressure.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.698
Spleen's a bigger threat
to the MAP.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.334
Two units on the infuser.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.568
Guidewire's ready.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.203
Stop what
you're doing.

17:50.237 --> 17:51.471
Have you even read
about this procedure?

17:53.306 --> 17:56.609
I supervised Jake putting
in a chest tube last week.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.445
Oh, good. Because
I'm sure you told him

17:58.478 --> 18:00.147
you always insert a gloved
finger and feel lung tissue

18:00.180 --> 18:01.548
before...

18:03.283 --> 18:04.351
before inserting the tube.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.185
Why is that, Mr. Scanlon?

18:05.218 --> 18:06.653
Uh...

18:06.686 --> 18:09.256
First, to break up
any adhesions.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.191
Second, if there is a
diaphragmatic injury,

18:11.224 --> 18:12.592
you could be in the abdominal
cavity and chest tubes

18:12.625 --> 18:14.727
don't work very well
in the stomach.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.196
Line is primed.

18:16.229 --> 18:18.798
Kerry, I think we can
take this from here.

18:23.170 --> 18:25.505
Uh... yes, I'm sure you can.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.445
That was fun.

18:34.414 --> 18:35.748
Would you like to tell me

18:35.782 --> 18:38.818
why she's so pissed off
at the two of you?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.887
Man, and I thought
I knew how to pimp.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.891
When did your
neck pain start?

18:44.924 --> 18:46.226
Came in from
Cleveland yesterday

18:46.259 --> 18:47.494
to help my brother move.

18:47.527 --> 18:48.661
I was lifting a chair.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.597
She had an MRI
last year--

18:50.630 --> 18:51.798
three slipped disks
in her neck.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.865
Any neuro findings?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.734
Motor and sensory intact.

18:54.767 --> 18:56.536
The pain goes down into her
arm, though. Don't forget that.

18:56.569 --> 18:57.804
NEELA:
I was going to order
some morphine.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.806
PATIENT:
Makes me sick
to my stomach.

18:59.839 --> 19:02.242
HUSBAND:
Demerol's the only thing that
works when she gets like this.

19:02.275 --> 19:03.943
We could try Toradol.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.212
Allergic.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.613
Demerol.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.217
Okay, we will be right back.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.818
Neck pain with radiculopathy

19:11.851 --> 19:13.453
consistent with herniated
disk syndrome.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.887
Allergic to Toradol--

19:14.921 --> 19:17.224
she may as well have told us
she's a Demerol addict.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.691
We have no objective test
for pain.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.227
Shouldn't we err on the side
of believing her?

19:20.260 --> 19:23.230
Give her the Demerol
and get her out the door.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.531
See what I mean?

19:24.564 --> 19:25.665
She's on every case.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.735
Looks good.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.737
Did Dr. Pratt show the
two-layer repair?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.573
Where is Dr. Pratt?

19:33.606 --> 19:35.275
I think he's looking
for supplies.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.843
Looking for supplies.

19:36.876 --> 19:38.411
Didn't this woman have
her daughter with her?

19:38.445 --> 19:40.613
That's where he is.

19:40.647 --> 19:41.748
He's, uh, with the daughter.

19:41.781 --> 19:42.882
He's helping her locate

19:42.915 --> 19:44.351
a skilled
nursing facility.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.788
CVP is 10, MAP is 80

19:48.821 --> 19:50.790
and we're transfusing
to an SCV O2 of 70.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.692
Once the crit is 30,
consider dopamine.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.927
Dr. Pratt, is there some
good reason

19:54.961 --> 19:56.796
why you've left your
student unsupervised?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.531
Other patients?

19:58.565 --> 20:00.600
Look, I've got a 75-year-old
man with urosepsis,

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
a woman in pulmonary edema

20:02.369 --> 20:05.438
and a kid with anaphylaxis
from a peanut allergy.

20:05.472 --> 20:07.840
And "my student" should
be supervised by an intern.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.676
Except that I asked
you to do it.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.580
You've got to stay
on these residents.

20:13.613 --> 20:15.448
Dr. Pratt isn't the problem.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.716
You know that break
you took?

20:16.749 --> 20:18.585
You may want
to take another one.

20:21.488 --> 20:22.689
Frank, have I gotten
any calls?

20:22.722 --> 20:23.823
Nope.

20:23.856 --> 20:24.857
You've been here
the whole time?

20:24.891 --> 20:26.025
Yep.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.361
I'm going out.

20:28.395 --> 20:29.729
Carter, would you
take over

20:29.762 --> 20:31.264
this bowel obstruction
in Four...

20:31.298 --> 20:33.266
Retinoschisis in Two...

20:33.300 --> 20:34.601
Mr. Langstaff with pyleo,

20:34.634 --> 20:36.769
he's waiting
on an admit to medicine.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.671
A 72 year-old female
with nausea

20:38.705 --> 20:40.873
and I need an LP
on the fever in Six.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.576
You're signing
out a spinal tap?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.845
So much for every case.

20:57.890 --> 21:00.727
( choir crooning harmonies )

21:08.901 --> 21:10.770
( choir continues )

21:21.514 --> 21:27.387
* Just as I am

21:27.420 --> 21:33.660
* Without one plea

21:33.693 --> 21:38.365
* But that Thy blood
was shed for me *

21:45.905 --> 21:51.744
* And that Thou bidst
me come to Thee *

21:58.418 --> 22:05.024
* O lamb of God

22:05.057 --> 22:08.495
* I come

22:08.528 --> 22:15.435
* I come.

22:18.571 --> 22:20.072
Thank you.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.908
Thanks, Ann.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.677
( all talking at once )

22:34.954 --> 22:37.056
Has it already
been two hours?

22:37.089 --> 22:39.792
I, I just thought I'd catch
some of the rehearsal.

22:39.826 --> 22:40.827
It was beautiful.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.432
It stopped snowing.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.701
I gotta get my coat.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.806
Seems like a lot of people
brought their families.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.809
I have two children--
two other children.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.611
Carl's 26. He
does something

22:58.645 --> 23:01.948
with the county court system
that I don't understand,

23:01.981 --> 23:04.651
and Lorie's a year
out of college.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.653
Free spirit,
bouncing around.

23:06.686 --> 23:09.121
And I'm... divorced.

23:09.155 --> 23:11.558
I always had
this image of you

23:11.591 --> 23:15.161
living somewhere with this
happily-ever-after family.

23:15.194 --> 23:19.532
Ending the marriage was more
difficult than I imagined.

23:19.566 --> 23:23.736
The church saved me,
gave me back my life.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.572
Except for that
part of my life

23:25.605 --> 23:27.574
that's taken up
with my business.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.008
I own an auto parts store.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.743
That's unusual.

23:30.777 --> 23:33.112
I know. Nobody
can quite believe it.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.648
But it was part of the
divorce settlement.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.650
Oh.

23:37.684 --> 23:39.652
Thank you.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.053
Why do you need it?

23:41.087 --> 23:42.489
You don't know?

23:44.023 --> 23:46.659
Uh, congenital
hip dysplasia.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.127
In common parlance,

23:48.160 --> 23:49.529
it's a birth defect.

23:49.562 --> 23:50.162
Birth defect?

23:50.196 --> 23:52.699
Yes.

23:52.732 --> 23:53.833
Something I gave you.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.635
Well, well, there's really

23:55.668 --> 23:56.569
no way to know.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.937
It's not that clear-cut.

23:58.705 --> 23:59.639
Helen?

24:02.909 --> 24:05.011
I was thinking about
what you said,

24:05.044 --> 24:07.847
about how I could've
been in Chicago

24:07.880 --> 24:10.049
a hundred times,
why this time?

24:11.918 --> 24:13.786
I think it's because
I just recently

24:13.820 --> 24:15.622
got the news that
your daddy died.

24:15.655 --> 24:18.124
Oh, no, my father
died years ago.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.026
That's not who I mean.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.961
Your other father.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.570
His name was Cody Boone.

24:30.603 --> 24:34.841
Should've been a character
in some old Western TV show.

24:34.874 --> 24:36.175
We were 15.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.210
Well, I was almost 15.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.548
And that was in South Carolina?

24:41.581 --> 24:42.882
Myrtle Beach.

24:42.915 --> 24:46.586
My daddy had a
miniature golf course.

24:46.619 --> 24:49.055
Cody worked there after school.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.691
So what happened?

24:51.724 --> 24:53.259
Nothing fancy.

24:53.292 --> 24:55.061
I got pregnant.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.765
All the parents pitched
a fit, and rightfully so.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.000
And abortion wasn't legal.

25:01.033 --> 25:03.870
Oh, I never would
have done that.

25:03.903 --> 25:06.739
Back then they had these homes
for girls in my condition.

25:06.773 --> 25:09.008
There was one up in Indiana
where my aunt lived,

25:09.041 --> 25:10.743
so they sent me up there.

25:10.777 --> 25:12.144
That's where you were born.

25:12.178 --> 25:15.047
Did you ever want to keep me?

25:15.081 --> 25:17.684
Oh, of course.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.619
Cody and I had a whole plan.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.153
He was gonna quit school,

25:21.187 --> 25:22.889
get work.

25:22.922 --> 25:25.324
There was a room over
his parents' garage

25:25.357 --> 25:26.292
where we could live...

25:28.327 --> 25:31.163
but in the end,

25:31.197 --> 25:33.866
you're 14, 15,
you got no money.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.104
So.

25:38.137 --> 25:40.172
I came to believe
that the best thing for you

25:40.206 --> 25:42.709
would be to be with people
who could care for you

25:42.742 --> 25:46.045
and do things for you.

25:46.078 --> 25:47.213
It was true, right?

25:48.314 --> 25:49.682
I don't know.

25:49.716 --> 25:50.650
Well, what
I mean is...

25:50.683 --> 25:51.918
I know what you mean.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.621
I had two
loving parents.

25:54.621 --> 25:57.657
I was happy,

25:57.690 --> 26:01.628
but even with that, it somehow
always... felt like rejection.

26:04.764 --> 26:06.032
Does that make sense?

26:08.635 --> 26:10.670
They took you so fast.

26:10.703 --> 26:13.740
I never held you.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.175
I never
even saw you,

26:16.208 --> 26:19.812
and nobody ever told me
anything about the birth defect.

26:22.114 --> 26:24.283
When I was a little girl,
I used to wonder

26:24.316 --> 26:26.753
if that's why I was given away--

26:26.786 --> 26:28.988
not quite perfect.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.925
All Jesus' children are perfect.

26:35.995 --> 26:39.799
An-and my father, Cody,
he nev... he didn't go with you?

26:39.832 --> 26:42.101
I never saw him again.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.103
Ever?

26:44.136 --> 26:46.105
But when you
heard he'd died...

26:46.138 --> 26:47.740
Kinda pushed a
button, huh?

26:50.009 --> 26:51.310
I guess I'd always

26:51.343 --> 26:54.847
thought about him
over the years...

26:54.881 --> 26:57.684
although not as much as
I thought about you.

26:57.684 --> 26:58.785
( beeping )

26:58.818 --> 27:01.688
Oh.

27:01.688 --> 27:02.755
That would be work.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.125
She's concerned,
and so am I.

27:06.158 --> 27:07.293
I understand,
Mr. Bulowski.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.895
The pain is still
in her neck.

27:08.928 --> 27:10.062
And still in my arm.

27:10.096 --> 27:11.698
Yes, I understand
that, too.

27:11.698 --> 27:13.199
I thought that you were
going to help her.

27:13.232 --> 27:14.000
Dr. Rasgotra?

27:14.033 --> 27:15.768
Excuse me.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.737
Mrs. Bulowski complained
that she was still in pain.

27:17.770 --> 27:18.805
And you explained
to her that she

27:18.838 --> 27:20.339
had already had her Demerol?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.308
So she suckered
you into a second shot.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.776
Well, one could look
at it that way.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.745
Jerry, I'm back!

27:25.778 --> 27:27.013
I didn't even know
you'd been gone.

27:27.046 --> 27:28.314
Uh, Kerry, I hope
you don't take this

27:28.347 --> 27:29.448
the wrong way but when
I said to take a break,

27:29.481 --> 27:31.083
I didn't mean
it literally.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.719
I didn't think I'd
be gone so long.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.419
We're getting
slammed here.

27:33.452 --> 27:35.254
Morris is out sick.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.289
We're boarding ten
ICU patients.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.325
We've got charts
in the rack for four hours,

27:39.358 --> 27:42.461
12 patients on the board,
and we're 50 behind in triage.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.063
You're back.
Yes.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.431
Are you
going out again?
Yes.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.033
Yes?
I irrigated

27:47.066 --> 27:48.467
the obnoxious bald
guy with the head lac.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.769
Got moved into Trauma Two.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.170
I can take
that, Susan.

27:51.203 --> 27:52.772
Okay. Thank you.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.042
ABBY:
I don't know.

27:56.075 --> 27:58.044
I don't understand.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.947
JAKE:
Well, after I
explain, you will.

28:00.980 --> 28:02.782
Dr. Weaver.
Kerry.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.852
I was looking for some obnoxious
bald guy who needs suturing?

28:05.885 --> 28:06.819
Yeah, he was
here, but...

28:06.853 --> 28:07.820
We put him
next door.

28:10.757 --> 28:12.859
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.060
Do you work here?

28:14.093 --> 28:16.228
My head is throbbing,
throbbing,

28:16.262 --> 28:18.064
throbbing.
No one will

28:18.097 --> 28:20.332
even give me
an aspirin. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:20.366 --> 28:22.201
What the hell
is going on?!

28:22.234 --> 28:26.172
Mr. Screwdriver, so
nice to see you again.

28:26.205 --> 28:27.373
Okay, Kerry...

28:27.406 --> 28:29.108
I-I, I take
full responsibility

28:29.141 --> 28:31.510
for this patient
still being in the ER.

28:31.543 --> 28:34.246
You don't think Dr. Dubenko
deserves just a soupçon of that?

28:34.280 --> 28:38.284
He ordered an NG, a foley,
three serial crits

28:38.317 --> 28:40.887
and a four-hour chest film.

28:40.920 --> 28:42.288
I hear everything,
Mr. Scanlon.

28:42.321 --> 28:43.890
She pretty much does.

28:43.923 --> 28:47.093
So, do we have some hope

28:47.126 --> 28:48.895
that this gentleman
will be sent upstairs

28:48.928 --> 28:51.363
in, let's say-- our lifetime?

28:51.397 --> 28:53.399
Ten minutes.

28:53.432 --> 28:56.035
Thank you, and when you're done
with him, do the guy next door.

28:59.271 --> 29:01.808
Does she have multiple
personalities?

29:04.844 --> 29:06.145
You're not on, bro.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.080
No, Dr. Morris has
failed to be on.

29:08.114 --> 29:09.381
I was rather
unceremoniously

29:09.415 --> 29:10.817
told to bring my ass
back in here.

29:10.850 --> 29:11.517
Have you seen
Neela or Carter?

29:11.550 --> 29:12.952
No.

29:12.985 --> 29:14.887
Dr. Barnett, you
got your first case.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.890
The well-fed, well-drugged
Bulowskis in Curtain Two.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.292
Review the chart and
kick their asses out of here.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.933
JANE:
They're both
good facilities.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.435
Locked doors so
patients can't wander,

29:29.468 --> 29:30.937
and the nursing staffs
are specially trained

29:30.970 --> 29:32.204
in handling
dementia patients.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.273
Thank you so much.

29:34.306 --> 29:35.875
Jane?

29:35.908 --> 29:38.945
Uh... Mrs. Devon's daughter,
the Pick's disease.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.113
I was going over some of the
nursing facilities with her.

29:41.147 --> 29:43.349
And Dr. Pratt, is
he even remotely

29:43.382 --> 29:45.117
involved with this
patient anymore?

29:45.151 --> 29:46.853
Yeah. We're
swamped, you know.

29:46.853 --> 29:47.920
One of the docs
is out sick,

29:47.954 --> 29:48.921
so he's been
really busy,

29:48.955 --> 29:51.490
but he's involved. Sort of.

29:51.523 --> 29:54.260
Wow. Wound edges
are everted nicely.

29:54.293 --> 29:55.594
Excellent approximation.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.096
Jane does good work.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.899
Were you waiting on
a Unasyn piggyback?

29:59.932 --> 30:00.900
Yeah, thanks, Haleh.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.234
Don't worry, I got this.

30:11.643 --> 30:14.947
Okay. Okay, I get it,
Mrs. Devon, but please,

30:14.981 --> 30:17.583
do not play with
the Kleenex box, all right?

30:24.991 --> 30:26.292
All right.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.060
You know what?

30:40.339 --> 30:42.975
4:30 and it's already dark.

30:43.009 --> 30:46.312
Winter.

30:46.345 --> 30:51.183
You really are
leaving, aren't you?

30:51.217 --> 30:54.320
You know that patient
who was here this morning,

30:54.353 --> 30:55.521
Sharon Williams?

30:55.554 --> 30:56.622
Yeah.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
She wasn't really
a patient.

31:02.361 --> 31:03.429
Yeah?

31:05.697 --> 31:08.667
Do you remember when I was
looking for my birth mother?

31:08.700 --> 31:11.470
Oh, my God. You found her?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.572
She found me.

31:13.605 --> 31:15.074
Kerry...

31:15.107 --> 31:16.342
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

31:16.375 --> 31:17.543
Is it weird?

31:17.576 --> 31:19.545
There's a lot to take in.

31:19.578 --> 31:24.216
I mean, there are certain things
that she's told me, and...

31:24.250 --> 31:27.253
there are a lot of things
I still have to tell her.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.690
I gotta go.

31:31.723 --> 31:35.627
I'm going to go home
and change, and, uh,

31:35.661 --> 31:37.964
I'm gonna go have some dinner.

31:37.964 --> 31:40.066
Well, yeah. Don't worry about
this place. We'll be fine.

31:40.099 --> 31:43.369
I'll try to stop by later.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.971
Susan, thanks.

31:49.441 --> 31:51.277
You said you
had pictures

31:51.310 --> 31:52.711
of some relatives?

31:52.744 --> 31:54.413
I want to hear
about Africa.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.382
Okay, we lived there
when I was little.

31:56.415 --> 31:58.417
The adoption people
said the family,

31:58.450 --> 32:00.987
your family,
were involved in the church.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.621
Were they actually
missionaries?

32:02.654 --> 32:05.491
More like wannabe
missionaries.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.459
My-my mom worked to
set up new schools

32:07.493 --> 32:09.161
and my dad was
a civil engineer.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.662
He taught me how
to build a canal,

32:10.696 --> 32:12.498
not that I've had
much use for that.

32:12.531 --> 32:15.534
Well, did you like
living over there?

32:15.567 --> 32:18.637
I was different simply
for being white.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.539
No one seemed to even
notice the crutch,

32:20.572 --> 32:23.309
and then... my parents

32:23.342 --> 32:24.410
were older.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.711
Their health wasn't so great,

32:25.744 --> 32:27.579
so we moved back
to Minneapolis

32:27.613 --> 32:30.016
when I was 12, and
they both passed away

32:30.049 --> 32:31.483
when I was in college.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.652
So they never got to see
you become a doctor?

32:33.685 --> 32:35.354
Mm-mm.
Oh.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.289
They would have been
so proud of you.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.558
I'm proud of you.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.727
My biggest regret is that

32:41.760 --> 32:44.196
they never got to
meet their grandson.

32:44.230 --> 32:45.764
You have a family?

32:45.797 --> 32:49.635
Uh, my son... Henry.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.737
He's named after my dad.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.741
There he is.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.277
Oh, my heavens,

32:58.310 --> 33:00.112
what a little doll.
13 months.

33:00.146 --> 33:02.448
Oh, that's a handful.

33:02.481 --> 33:05.084
Between him
and a full-time job,

33:05.117 --> 33:06.685
no wonder you need a nanny.

33:08.754 --> 33:10.589
Is your husband a doctor, too?

33:14.526 --> 33:17.429
I'm alone now.
There was an accident.

33:17.463 --> 33:19.065
Oh, my God, Kerry.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.499
I'm so sorry.

33:20.532 --> 33:22.068
Was it recent?

33:22.101 --> 33:24.403
Last year.

33:24.436 --> 33:27.106
Oh, Kerry. My dear Kerry.

33:29.808 --> 33:33.345
We are tested,
but the Lord gives us strength.

33:33.379 --> 33:37.316
I can only imagine
how difficult this has been.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.318
But you have
to have faith.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.652
Paul wrote

33:40.686 --> 33:42.221
in Romans 8:

33:42.254 --> 33:45.557
"I am convinced
that neither death nor life,

33:45.591 --> 33:47.759
"nor angels nor rulers,

33:47.793 --> 33:50.362
"nor things present,
nor things to come

33:50.396 --> 33:52.698
"can separate us
from the love of God

33:52.731 --> 33:55.534
in Christ Jesus, our Lord."

34:01.107 --> 34:01.740
( sighs )

34:03.275 --> 34:04.443
( taking deep breaths )

34:10.516 --> 34:11.449
Are you waiting?

34:11.483 --> 34:12.851
What?

34:12.884 --> 34:15.521
Oh, no, go ahead.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.663
( sighs )

34:24.696 --> 34:26.831
This is my Uncle Jackson.

34:26.864 --> 34:28.534
Loved stealing cars.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.335
Just had
a real passion for it.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.638
Do you have any pictures
of my father?

34:32.670 --> 34:35.774
Just one.

34:35.806 --> 34:37.609
When I was away

34:37.643 --> 34:40.446
in Indiana, Cody drove
all the way up to see me.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.248
Didn't even have
a license yet.

34:42.281 --> 34:44.382
For the life of me,
I don't know

34:44.416 --> 34:46.452
what we thought
we had to smile about.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.190
This is my family, Helen.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.659
This woman's name
is Sandy Lopez,

34:53.692 --> 34:55.293
and she's not my nanny.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.895
She was my partner.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.630
Your partner.

34:58.664 --> 35:01.167
My lover, my wife.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.169
The mother of my child.

35:03.202 --> 35:05.737
She was a firefighter,

35:05.771 --> 35:08.740
and she died last year.

35:10.709 --> 35:12.344
You're gay?

35:12.378 --> 35:14.646
Yes.

35:16.815 --> 35:21.187
I wanted to tell you earlier,
but I was afraid.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.190
My mom and dad died before
I came to accept it,

35:24.190 --> 35:25.791
so I never got a chance
to tell them.

35:26.892 --> 35:28.760
Uh...

35:28.794 --> 35:32.231
uh, so they never knew
you made this choice.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.732
It's not a choice.

35:33.765 --> 35:36.435
It's who I am,
who I was born as.

35:37.569 --> 35:40.506
Will you pray with me?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.209
No. No. I am not
gonna do this.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.810
Kerry, please...

35:44.843 --> 35:46.645
Kerry...

35:46.678 --> 35:48.847
HELEN:
I didn't mean to offend you.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.916
I was just so glad
to find you.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.918
And my being gay
changes that?

35:52.951 --> 35:55.454
This is who I am.
It's wrong, Kerry.

35:55.487 --> 35:58.490
I knew this was a mistake.
It's not what
God created.

35:58.524 --> 36:00.759
Why are people like you
always saying things like that?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.494
Why are people like you

36:02.528 --> 36:04.296
so dismissive of
people of faith?

36:04.330 --> 36:05.964
Because you have no faith

36:05.997 --> 36:07.933
that God knew
what he was doing,

36:07.966 --> 36:09.668
that God created me, too.

36:09.701 --> 36:11.803
God did create you
and He loves you.

36:11.837 --> 36:15.407
What is it about us
that is so much more threatening

36:15.441 --> 36:18.244
than all the really terrible
things in the world?

36:18.277 --> 36:20.912
Don't dismiss me
so easily, Kerry.
People are starving,

36:20.946 --> 36:22.381
people are being shot at,

36:22.414 --> 36:23.982
men are flying planes
into buildings,

36:24.015 --> 36:27.619
yet the faithful are saying,
"Watch out for those lesbians,

36:27.653 --> 36:29.921
they're gonna destroy
our God-gifted lives."

36:29.955 --> 36:32.458
Well, the world
isn't perfect, it's
what we make it.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.893
You just finished telling me
how perfect it was.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.596
That neither life nor death,
angels nor rulers

36:37.629 --> 36:39.531
can separate us
from the love of God

36:39.565 --> 36:41.700
in Christ Jesus, our Lord.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.935
I know the words, Helen,
I was raised in the church.

36:43.969 --> 36:45.837
Then you know it's
healing mission.

36:45.871 --> 36:48.474
Except that the welcome sign's
not out for everyone, is it?

36:49.775 --> 36:51.877
Do you hate all faith?

36:51.910 --> 36:53.312
No. No, of course not.

36:53.345 --> 36:56.282
I hate that my own faith
now excludes me,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.917
tries to tell me I'm a sinner
because of the people I love.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.953
It's the people
you've chosen to love.

37:01.987 --> 37:03.955
I have made a choice:

37:03.989 --> 37:07.693
to stop living a lie
about who I am.

37:07.726 --> 37:10.329
I was alone in my soul.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.997
Do you know
what that feels like?

37:16.968 --> 37:19.004
My... my hotel's nearby.

37:19.037 --> 37:21.507
I think I'll walk.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.850
They won't budge.
And I called Cleveland Memorial.

37:31.883 --> 37:33.051
She goes there twice a week
asking for Demerol.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.020
She's in their
turkey files.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.855
We're not gonna cure her habit
by denying her drugs today.

37:36.888 --> 37:39.024
Just kick her out, please?
Weaver's gonna be pissed.

37:39.057 --> 37:40.025
Watch and learn.

37:40.058 --> 37:41.760
Mrs. Bulowski...

37:41.793 --> 37:43.962
I understand you're still
experiencing some pain.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.531
It's better, but I think

37:45.564 --> 37:46.765
one more shot of Demerol
would really do it.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.767
You've already
had two.
Hey.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.636
CARTER:
Well, the problem is,
is that

37:50.669 --> 37:53.339
when you use it regularly,
as... I think that you do,

37:53.339 --> 37:54.606
it doesn't work as well,

37:54.640 --> 37:56.074
and you can grow
dependent on it.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.944
Are you saying that my wife
is some kind of drug addict?

37:58.977 --> 38:00.379
You don't know
what real pain is.

38:00.412 --> 38:02.080
I'm not sure that's really fair.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.582
MR. BULOWSKI:
What do you know
about fair?

38:03.615 --> 38:04.883
Mr. Bulowski.
You think it's fair

38:04.916 --> 38:06.818
that my wife has
this kind of pain?

38:06.852 --> 38:08.887
You said you would
bring her another shot,
and you never came back.

38:08.920 --> 38:09.988
Mr. Bulowski...
I'm not talking to you!

38:10.021 --> 38:11.623
Jerry, call Security.

38:11.657 --> 38:13.359
You like stringing
people along, is that it?

38:13.359 --> 38:14.593
Okay, you need to...

38:14.626 --> 38:15.727
Will you get the
hell away from me?!

38:15.761 --> 38:17.763
( grunting )

38:17.796 --> 38:19.498
RAY:
Come on!

38:19.531 --> 38:20.532
( Mrs. Bulowski grunting )

38:20.566 --> 38:21.900
Get him off of me!

38:21.933 --> 38:23.935
Beth! Come on, Beth!
Where the hell are you?

38:23.969 --> 38:26.372
Beth! Beth!
Get him off of me, Beth!

38:26.405 --> 38:27.739
( bedpan clangs )

38:27.773 --> 38:29.675
( panicked shouts continue )

38:31.877 --> 38:33.379
What the hell am I doing?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.681
( grunting )

38:35.714 --> 38:37.916
Who's winning?

38:37.949 --> 38:40.552
Neela was about to deck
somebody with a bedpan.

38:40.586 --> 38:42.988
JERRY:
I've always wanted to see
something like that.

38:43.021 --> 38:44.723
Hard to let go of a
dream, isn't it, Jerry?

38:44.756 --> 38:45.824
So, are we under control?

38:45.857 --> 38:46.992
Yeah, I'd say so.

38:47.025 --> 38:48.660
Thought you were gone
for the day.

38:48.694 --> 38:50.429
Yeah. Me, too.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.931
Charlotte? Charlotte?

38:52.964 --> 38:54.666
It's okay, she's gonna be
right back, Mrs. Devon.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.001
Hey, where's her daughter?

38:56.034 --> 38:57.703
She had to pick up
her kids.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.938
What's she doing?
Is the roast...

38:59.971 --> 39:02.574
is the roast going
to be ready?
Don't worry,

39:02.608 --> 39:04.610
the roast is gonna be
just fine, okay?

39:04.643 --> 39:07.446
She's folding napkins
for her dinner party.

39:07.479 --> 39:10.115
The literature says that,
generally, you shouldn't play

39:10.148 --> 39:12.017
into this kind
of delusional thinking,

39:12.050 --> 39:13.552
but I don't really
get the point of that
in this case, do you?

39:14.953 --> 39:16.555
You got this?

39:16.588 --> 39:17.923
I think so.

39:17.956 --> 39:19.124
Dr. Weaver.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.992
What's going on with
the Pick's Disease?

39:21.026 --> 39:22.127
Found a bed
for her tonight.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.762
Her daughter managed
a placement,

39:23.795 --> 39:25.964
but they won't be able
to take her till tomorrow.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.801
Thanks.
Hey, I just wanted you
to know that, um,

39:29.835 --> 39:32.103
I'm willing to have Jane
assigned to me anytime.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.672
I'll bet. She's good.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.474
( chuckles ):
Yeah, no kidding.

39:35.507 --> 39:36.742
Hey, so, did you hear?

39:36.775 --> 39:38.510
They're bringing in
a fisherman vs. horse.

39:38.544 --> 39:40.078
Vs. horse?
Yeah, I know.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.680
You'd think
it'd be vs. fish,

39:41.713 --> 39:43.982
which doesn't make sense,
either, but...
Go.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.653
Hey, Kerry.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.822
Hey. Aren't you in
a little early?

39:50.856 --> 39:53.725
An hour. But with Sam on days
and me on nights,

39:53.759 --> 39:55.727
we're just trying to steal
a moment when we can.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.064
Have a good night.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.466
Thanks.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.232
Good evening.

40:34.265 --> 40:36.568
Can I help you?

40:53.051 --> 40:55.186
Helen?

40:57.222 --> 40:58.957
Helen?

40:58.990 --> 41:00.559
( muttering ):
That's the wrong...

41:00.592 --> 41:02.694
They tell you
the coffee's free.

41:02.728 --> 41:05.697
( chuckles ):
You just got to pay for
the room, that's all.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.702
You think about a day like this
for a long time.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.173
You play out every scenario
in your head.

41:15.206 --> 41:19.678
Except for this one.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.613
Is it because
I gave you up?

41:21.647 --> 41:25.116
No. No, of course not.

41:25.150 --> 41:27.686
Is it because
I didn't come looking for you

41:27.719 --> 41:29.655
for so many years?

41:29.688 --> 41:33.158
You don't get to paint
the whole picture
yourself, Helen.

41:33.191 --> 41:36.562
Feel guilty because
you gave up a child,
and then...

41:36.562 --> 41:39.030
get all warm and
fuzzy because it
turned out all right:

41:39.064 --> 41:41.867
she had a good family,
became a doctor.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.802
If you're disappointed,
it should be

41:43.835 --> 41:45.671
with the limitations
of your faith,

41:45.704 --> 41:47.773
not in the way
that I've lived my life.

41:47.806 --> 41:51.009
I gave birth to a child
who I abandoned.

41:51.042 --> 41:55.747
For all the right reasons,
they told me.

41:55.781 --> 41:57.883
But I thought about you.

41:57.916 --> 42:00.652
And I came to realize

42:00.686 --> 42:03.622
that by giving you up,

42:03.655 --> 42:05.957
I'd broken my own heart.

42:05.991 --> 42:10.929
And faith is the only thing
that gave me hope.

42:10.962 --> 42:14.600
Gave me courage.

42:14.633 --> 42:17.202
I can't abandon it, too.

42:17.235 --> 42:21.072
Can you accept me for who I am?

42:21.106 --> 42:23.775
I can love you,

42:23.809 --> 42:26.745
whoever you are.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.047
I don't want love
without acceptance.

42:37.989 --> 42:40.759
It was so good
to finally meet you.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.953
( choir crooning harmonies )

43:08.305 --> 43:14.616
