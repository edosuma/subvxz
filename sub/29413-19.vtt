WEBVTT

00:13.100 --> 00:14.884
Hey, Tina.
How's it going?

00:14.927 --> 00:16.190
Don't ask.

00:16.233 --> 00:18.322
Uh-oh. Is that
a "don't ask don't ask"

00:18.366 --> 00:20.368
or a "don't ask please ask"?

00:20.411 --> 00:21.499
Actually, I don't
know why I'm asking,

00:21.543 --> 00:23.849
'cause either way
I'm gonna ask.

00:23.893 --> 00:26.374
I just haven't been
feeling right lately,

00:26.417 --> 00:28.854
so I went to the doctor, and...

00:28.898 --> 00:31.161
he told me
I'm starting menopause.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.423
What?!

00:32.467 --> 00:35.296
You seem way too
young for menopause.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.385
Don't let thishigh-sittin' booty fool you.

00:38.647 --> 00:41.867
It is holding onto my lower back for dear life.

00:41.911 --> 00:45.784
Tina Butler, don't you talk
about your booty that way.

00:45.828 --> 00:48.483
Your booty is
my booty's personal hero.

00:49.527 --> 00:50.963
Face it, Gemma,

00:51.007 --> 00:53.401
I'm turning into an old lady.

00:53.444 --> 00:55.490
If I try to drop itlike it's hot now,

00:55.533 --> 00:57.405
I might not be ableto pick it up.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.929
That's ridiculous.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.452
You don't understand.

01:01.496 --> 01:03.933
From here on out,it's all downhill.

01:03.976 --> 01:06.892
My health is gonna fail,
my memory is gonna go,

01:06.936 --> 01:11.332
and worst of all,
I might start looking my age!

01:12.376 --> 01:14.335
Look, I-I know you're upset,

01:14.378 --> 01:16.467
but this is
a natural part of life.

01:16.511 --> 01:18.774
And you have
an amazing partner in Calvin

01:18.817 --> 01:20.428
to help you through it.

01:21.472 --> 01:22.473
Yeah.

01:22.517 --> 01:24.693
It's just a huge thing,
you know?

01:24.736 --> 01:26.695
I don't know how to tell him.

01:26.738 --> 01:28.392
Well, however
you decide to do it,

01:28.436 --> 01:30.133
I'm sure it will be right.

01:31.134 --> 01:32.788
Hey, Tina.
What's for dinner?

01:32.831 --> 01:35.660
I'm starting menopause!

01:38.185 --> 01:40.100
No, that's okay.
I had a big lunch.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.277
♪ Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood ♪

01:43.320 --> 01:44.539
♪ Welcome to the hood.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.590
Hey, Calvin. Whatcha doing?

01:52.634 --> 01:54.853
I'm just having some lunch,
watching the game.

01:54.897 --> 01:57.508
I'd offer you a slice,
but I don't want to.

01:59.467 --> 02:01.295
Why are you doing it out here
when you got

02:01.338 --> 02:02.513
a couch
and big-screen TV inside?

02:02.557 --> 02:04.472
Oh. 'Cause Tina is in there

02:04.515 --> 02:07.127
going through
some major mood swings.

02:07.170 --> 02:10.478
You ever seen someoneyell, laugh and cry

02:10.521 --> 02:12.349
all at once?

02:13.568 --> 02:16.266
It's like a whole Lifetime moviecrammed into one woman.

02:17.354 --> 02:18.660
I'd watch that.

02:19.748 --> 02:20.966
I'm telling you, man,

02:21.010 --> 02:22.751
this menopause thingis no joke.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.753
I am walking on eggshellsaround there.

02:24.796 --> 02:27.364
And not just because shethrew a dozen eggs at me.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.150
Gemma filled me in.

02:30.193 --> 02:32.543
I figured something was up
when Tina barked at me,

02:32.587 --> 02:34.632
"You keep walkin', Screech!"

02:37.374 --> 02:41.813
Let me guess-- she got all sadand teary-eyed after that.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.685
One of us did.

02:45.034 --> 02:46.427
Well, at this point,

02:46.470 --> 02:48.820
I think it's just bestthat I keep my distance

02:48.864 --> 02:51.736
until this whole messblows over.

02:51.780 --> 02:53.347
Well, Calvin, menopause
isn't something

02:53.390 --> 02:54.435
that just "blows over."

02:54.478 --> 02:55.958
It's a big deal for women.

02:56.001 --> 02:58.178
You know, when my
mom went through it,

02:58.221 --> 03:01.572
she was afraid that men
wouldn't see her as a
sexual being anymore.

03:01.616 --> 03:04.401
And I had to convince her that
she was still smokin' hot.

03:07.143 --> 03:09.406
Now, that's a Lifetime movie Iwould watch.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.159
Hey, Marty.Oh, hey, Grover.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.205
Any chance I could come
and do my laundry here?

03:25.248 --> 03:27.294
I asked my mom to do it,
but she started crying,

03:27.337 --> 03:30.384
then laughing,
then she threw an egg at me.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.950
Sure. Come on in.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.432
Hey-hey, what's all this?

03:35.476 --> 03:36.868
I'm building a robot.

03:36.912 --> 03:39.349
My school has a fighter bot
competition next week,

03:39.393 --> 03:41.308
and I really want
to beat Spencer.

03:41.351 --> 03:43.440
Oh, Spencer. Isn't that the kidthat started that rumor

03:43.484 --> 03:45.268
that your mom
still tucks you in?

03:45.312 --> 03:47.139
Yeah. Total lie.

03:48.837 --> 03:51.100
Yeah, I can relate.
When I was in middle school,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.233
some kid started a rumor
that I practiced kissing

03:53.276 --> 03:55.017
on my Chewbacca doll.

03:55.060 --> 03:57.280
That's gross.
No one would do that.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.456
Yeah. Total lie.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.288
You know, if you want,I could give you some pointers

04:05.332 --> 04:06.724
while you build your robot.

04:06.768 --> 04:08.770
Help you take
this Spencer punk down.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.119
That'd be great!

04:10.162 --> 04:11.425
Then we can track down the guy

04:11.468 --> 04:12.904
who started the rumor about you.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.384
Yeah, well,
we don't have to look far.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.690
Malcolm lives right next door.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.132
Malcolm!

04:23.175 --> 04:25.439
I'm having another hot flash!

04:25.482 --> 04:28.442
Crank up the air conditioner!

04:32.663 --> 04:34.404
Hey, come on, Ma,

04:34.448 --> 04:36.406
I'm already
freezing to death in here.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.278
Boy, don't test me.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.498
My body may be out of eggs,
but I'm not!

04:44.632 --> 04:46.503
Get the door!

04:48.940 --> 04:50.333
Hey, Gemma.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.378
Hey, guys. Oh!

04:51.421 --> 04:54.468
It's like a meat locker in here.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.643
You see, Ma?

04:55.686 --> 04:57.688
Even the white people
are cold in here.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.388
Hey, girl.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.477
Thanks for coming over.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.870
It's so nice when young people
come and visit you.

05:08.873 --> 05:10.701
Okay, Tina, I
have been thinking

05:10.745 --> 05:12.486
about what you're
going through,

05:12.529 --> 05:15.358
and I realized I totally
know how you feel.

05:15.402 --> 05:16.446
You do?

05:16.490 --> 05:18.927
Yeah. I know
you're feeling old

05:18.970 --> 05:20.624
and past your prime.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.975
I felt the exact same
way when I turned 30.

05:27.762 --> 05:29.241
Which is nothing like what
you're going through.

05:29.285 --> 05:30.504
Please don't throw
an egg at me.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.854
So, what's your point?

05:32.897 --> 05:35.422
I'm saying I felt like
my days of adventure

05:35.465 --> 05:36.814
and youth were over.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.295
But Dave figured out
a way to help me.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.252
How?

05:40.296 --> 05:41.993
He took me skydiving.

05:42.037 --> 05:43.343
Skydiving?

05:43.386 --> 05:46.171
You mean like gettingoff a plane before it lands?

05:46.215 --> 05:48.391
Yeah. I know it
sounds crazy,

05:48.435 --> 05:52.352
but after I jumped, I felt
wild and fun and alive.

05:52.395 --> 05:55.180
And afterwards, the
idea of getting older

05:55.224 --> 05:57.052
wasn't so scary anymore.

05:57.095 --> 05:59.794
Ah. I guessthat makes sense.

05:59.837 --> 06:01.448
And I think if you try it,

06:01.491 --> 06:04.276
you'll see that the most
exciting parts of your life

06:04.320 --> 06:05.930
are still ahead of you.

06:07.279 --> 06:08.368
You know what?

06:08.411 --> 06:10.544
What the hell? I'm in.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.502
We're going skydiving.

06:12.546 --> 06:14.548
Oh, I'm not going.
I worked out my mess.

06:20.423 --> 06:22.991
Ho-ho! Nice job,little man.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.993
Your design looks good.Thanks.

06:25.036 --> 06:27.778
Now, you sure your mama's okay
with you using all her forks?

06:27.822 --> 06:29.432
If this thing works,

06:29.476 --> 06:31.391
I'll be making the rules
around here.

06:33.610 --> 06:37.005
Wow. Looks like
I helped build twomonsters.

06:37.048 --> 06:39.007
Here, let's give ita test run.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.878
Attack this pillow.

06:40.922 --> 06:44.012
This is gonna be awesome!Yeah.

06:50.366 --> 06:52.412
GROVER:
No!

06:53.456 --> 06:54.805
Ah, should've
seen this coming

06:54.849 --> 06:57.242
when your blueprints
were in crayon.

06:58.548 --> 07:00.550
What am I gonna do?

07:00.594 --> 07:02.422
I can't beat Spencerwith this.

07:02.465 --> 07:05.468
Little man, you can't beat
a Caesar salad with this.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.253
This is so embarrassing.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.474
Spencer's gonna have the
whole school making fun of me.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.563
I should just give up.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.522
Are you kidding?
There is no way

07:15.565 --> 07:16.914
we're letting
Spencer win.

07:16.958 --> 07:19.134
What am I going to do?

07:19.177 --> 07:21.353
My robot just losta pillow fight.

07:21.397 --> 07:23.530
To a pillow!

07:25.880 --> 07:27.925
Okay, don't worry,
I got a plan.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.841
I'm gonna take this down
to the robotics lab at JPL

07:30.885 --> 07:33.017
and give this thing
some serious firepower.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.323
You can do that?

07:34.366 --> 07:35.498
Well, I can
definitely do better

07:35.542 --> 07:37.065
than a table
setting for eight.

07:39.067 --> 07:41.504
Awesome! I can't waitto tell my mom

07:41.548 --> 07:43.506
when she tucks me...

07:43.550 --> 07:47.162
I mean, when Iput myselfto bed.

07:47.205 --> 07:50.165
Yeah, that's okay.
We both know I made
out with that doll.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.651
Hey, beautiful.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.218
Damn, it's
white-people cold in here.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.875
What's that behind your back?

08:05.746 --> 08:08.575
These.Oh...

08:08.618 --> 08:11.665
They're gorgeous. Oh.

08:11.708 --> 08:14.015
And I got 'em from an actual
flower shop this time,

08:14.058 --> 08:16.191
not that creepy dude that
lives by the off-ramp.

08:18.323 --> 08:20.630
Thank you, baby. Mm!

08:20.674 --> 08:22.240
Hey, look, babe.

08:22.284 --> 08:25.243
You know, as a man,
there's no way for me

08:25.287 --> 08:27.202
to understand what
you're feeling,

08:27.245 --> 08:29.509
and I just want to
let you know that...

08:29.552 --> 08:30.988
you're not in this alone.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.556
So no matter what
the future holds,

08:33.600 --> 08:36.472
you're my ride-or-die.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.474
That is really great to hear.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.520
Mm.You know, 'causeI've been thinking

08:40.563 --> 08:42.870
about us doingsomething a little crazy.

08:42.913 --> 08:46.177
You know? To make us feelyoung and wild again.

08:46.221 --> 08:49.180
Well, all right!

08:49.224 --> 08:50.442
Oh!

08:50.486 --> 08:53.663
Malcolm! If you
home, get out!

08:54.664 --> 08:56.318
No, no, no, baby.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.668
I'm talking about somethingoutside of the house.

08:58.712 --> 09:01.802
Oh. So you're trying
to get freakyfreaky.

09:01.845 --> 09:03.760
: Okay.
All right, Malcolm,

09:03.804 --> 09:05.806
you can stay-- we're leaving.
Come on, now.No, no,

09:05.849 --> 09:07.242
no, no, baby.

09:07.285 --> 09:08.939
We're not leaving.

09:08.983 --> 09:10.680
We're going skydiving.

09:10.724 --> 09:13.683
Skydiving?Mm-hmm.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.772
Please tell me that's
a new position.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.690
No. I will be jumpingout of an airplane tomorrow.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.345
And now that I knowwe're in this together,

09:23.388 --> 09:25.434
I don't have to do it alone.

09:26.740 --> 09:28.306
Right?

09:28.350 --> 09:30.744
C-C-Can men get
the menopause?

09:30.787 --> 09:31.788
Huh?

09:33.355 --> 09:35.575
'Cause I'm having
a hot flash.

09:43.800 --> 09:44.758
Oh.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.411
Great. I'm glad you're here.

09:46.455 --> 09:48.544
Oh, here we go.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.373
Whenever you'reglad to see me,you need my help.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.244
That's not true.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.246
But I need your help.

09:55.290 --> 09:57.422
Look, I need you to
convince your mother

09:57.466 --> 09:59.207
not to go skydiving.

09:59.250 --> 10:01.339
Why, Pop?
Are you worried about her?

10:01.383 --> 10:04.212
No. I'm worried about me.

10:04.255 --> 10:06.388
Okay, then just tell her
you don't want to go.

10:06.431 --> 10:07.737
I can't do that.

10:07.781 --> 10:09.957
This is important
to the woman I love.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.481
I got to pretend
like I care.

10:12.524 --> 10:15.397
Oh, so you want me
to be the bad guy

10:15.440 --> 10:17.791
and kill her dreams
so you don't have to?

10:17.834 --> 10:19.357
Good. So you get it.

10:19.401 --> 10:21.751
All right, today's
the big day.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.623
And I support that.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.537
Come on. Go.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.063
Yeah.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.630
Hey, Ma, look,

10:30.673 --> 10:33.371
about this whole,
uh, skydiving thing?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.286
You know, I couldn't
sleep all night worrying

10:35.330 --> 10:36.766
that something might
happen to you.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.421
I mean, jumping out of a plane--that's really dangerous.

10:39.464 --> 10:40.683
Oh, you don't haveto worry about that.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.032
It's a lot saferthan you think.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.991
Yeah, maybe, but still,

10:44.034 --> 10:45.732
what if something
goes wrong? What if...?

10:45.775 --> 10:48.735
Malcolm! Stop it!

10:52.564 --> 10:54.088
What?

10:54.131 --> 10:56.307
This is very importantto your mother.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.353
We raised youbetter than that.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.837
Yeah.

11:03.880 --> 11:07.710
Okay. Okay,
but-but think...

11:07.754 --> 11:09.320
about the risk, right?

11:09.364 --> 11:10.670
Have you considered...?

11:10.713 --> 11:12.759
Your mother's feelings?

11:12.802 --> 11:15.544
Because I have,and you should, too.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.633
Oh, it's okay, Calvin.
You know, he's just...

11:17.677 --> 11:19.722
You know what, Ma? Pop
is right. You shouldgo.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.985
What?Yeah, I was
being selfish.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.770
I should be
more supportive.

11:23.813 --> 11:25.119
Like you, Pop.

11:25.162 --> 11:27.817
Aw. Thank you.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.732
You're welcome.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.560
Now, now, now,now, hold-hold on now.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.780
You know, the-the moreI think about it,

11:33.823 --> 11:35.520
Malcolm did makesome good points.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.566
And you're alwaystelling him

11:37.609 --> 11:39.263
that he's smarterthan I think he is.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.833
Nope, you
convinced me.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.748
I was completely
wrong.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.533
Go ahead, Ma. I'll see
you when you get back.Ah.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.580
Ifyou get back.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.550
Whoa!

12:09.337 --> 12:11.600
Is that my
fighter bot?!

12:11.643 --> 12:12.514
It sure is.

12:12.557 --> 12:13.776
Complete with an infrared,

12:13.820 --> 12:15.299
motion-activatedtargeting system

12:15.343 --> 12:16.866
and artificial intelligence.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.869
Awesome!
What does that mean?

12:19.913 --> 12:23.525
It means once we activate theAI, the robot controls itself.

12:23.568 --> 12:26.136
So I didn't build it,
and I don't control it.

12:26.180 --> 12:27.616
How is this still my project?

12:27.659 --> 12:29.705
Well, I wrote your nameon the bottom.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.794
It's good enough for me.All right.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.753
Okay, let me show youhow this works.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.276
Okay.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.758
MARTY:
All right.

12:38.801 --> 12:41.282
Right now,it's learning its environment.

12:41.325 --> 12:44.676
And now, it's lookingfor a target.

12:47.070 --> 12:48.419
Uh, now we better run!

12:50.421 --> 12:51.683
Oh!

12:53.337 --> 12:55.775
Come on.

12:55.818 --> 12:58.690
Thanks againfor arranging this, Dave.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.736
Yeah, Dave.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.260
You definitely got
some payback coming.Ah.

13:03.304 --> 13:06.002
Uh, wow, Calvin. I thought you
were gonna be mad about this.

13:07.308 --> 13:08.657
Okay, jumpers,

13:08.700 --> 13:10.746
I hope you all enjoyed
the instructional video.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.880
And not to brag, but those were
my hands doing the buckles.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.666
So, does anyone
have any questions?

13:17.709 --> 13:20.756
Yeah, I do. Um, how
dangerous is this?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.715
And, you know, I'm not
asking for me, but...

13:23.759 --> 13:26.806
our unsupportive son is
very worried about us.

13:26.849 --> 13:29.591
There's no reason
to be afraid.

13:29.634 --> 13:31.811
We've had thousands of jumps
without any accidents.

13:31.854 --> 13:33.943
One lady even jumped
with her cat.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.684
Spoiler alert-- it was me!

13:37.251 --> 13:38.687
Aw, that's so cute,

13:38.730 --> 13:41.168
but I ain't jumpingwith no damn cat.Yeah.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.692
Oh, don't worry.
He's not here, but want to see

13:43.735 --> 13:47.174
some pictures of himin his jumpsuit?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.219
Okay, Calvin...

13:49.263 --> 13:51.221
I can tell that
you're nervous,

13:51.265 --> 13:53.310
but trust me,
you're gonna be fine.

13:53.354 --> 13:55.704
In the military, I
jumped dozens of times,

13:55.747 --> 13:58.272
and almost all of 'em
went off without a hitch.

13:58.315 --> 14:02.842
Almost?What do you mean "almost"?

14:02.885 --> 14:05.105
I don't really like
to talk about it,

14:05.148 --> 14:07.542
but there was one
night jump outside of Baghdad.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.936
Yeah, our plane was
under heavy fire,

14:09.979 --> 14:13.287
so... we had to bail
out fast and low,

14:13.330 --> 14:16.594
and I... I got
pretty messed up.

14:16.638 --> 14:19.206
Wow. Dave, were you shot?

14:19.249 --> 14:21.991
Oh, no. I landed
in an olive tree.

14:24.254 --> 14:28.824
Spent the whole night fighting
off this, oh, very horny owl.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.741
Uh, quick follow-up.

14:32.784 --> 14:34.961
Will there be owls?

14:36.788 --> 14:37.964
Oh, come on, Calvin.

14:38.007 --> 14:39.704
Are you gonna do this
with me or not?

14:39.748 --> 14:41.881
I thought you saidyou were my ride-or-die.

14:41.924 --> 14:46.624
Yeah, but right now, I'm
focusing on the "ride" part.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.104
Okay, since you two
are beginners,

14:48.148 --> 14:49.758
you're gonna be tandem jumping,which means

14:49.801 --> 14:51.238
you'll be strapped
to an expert.

14:51.281 --> 14:53.022
Tina, you're gonna be with me.Ah.

14:53.066 --> 14:56.243
And, uh, what expert
will I be strapped to?

14:56.286 --> 14:58.898
Hey, buddy.

15:00.856 --> 15:02.814
Oh, hell no.

15:02.858 --> 15:05.730
I'd rather spend the nightwith a horny owl.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.869
Okay, I thinkit's gone into sleep mode.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.523
I'm gonna slowly getto the controller

15:15.566 --> 15:18.004
and hit the kill switch.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.919
Whoa!

15:19.962 --> 15:22.051
Okay, plan B--we live up here forever.

15:22.095 --> 15:24.358
What are we gonna do?!

15:24.401 --> 15:25.707
Well, don't worry.
As long as we stay up here,

15:25.750 --> 15:27.056
we're perfectly safe.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.928
So it can't climb stairs?

15:28.971 --> 15:30.146
We are notsafe.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.713
Oh...

15:34.324 --> 15:35.891
Hey, guys.
What are you doing up there?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.112
Mom, look out!

15:39.155 --> 15:42.463
Oh, is that your little robot?

15:42.506 --> 15:44.160
Gemma, freeze!

15:44.204 --> 15:45.857
Okay, I don't have timeto explain,

15:45.901 --> 15:47.337
but I built your sona killer robot.

15:47.381 --> 15:50.079
It may have acquiredthe taste for blood.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.342
What?! Why would you do that?!

15:52.386 --> 15:54.388
Because Malcolm saidI kissed Chewbacca!

15:55.432 --> 15:56.825
Well, what do I do?!

15:56.868 --> 15:59.262
Okay, I can hear the panicin your voice.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.134
And so can it. Run!

16:01.177 --> 16:04.137
What? Oh!

16:04.180 --> 16:05.747
Come on!

16:05.790 --> 16:08.576
Oh!Make it stop! Make it stop!

16:10.839 --> 16:12.058
Okay, stay here.

16:12.101 --> 16:13.929
I'm gonna help her.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.584
Oh!

16:16.627 --> 16:18.629
She was a nice lady.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.679
Marty, I thinkthis belongs to you.

16:28.074 --> 16:29.858
How did you beat it?

16:29.901 --> 16:31.947
I'm married to Dave.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.080
You think that's the first
crazy robot I've had to kill?

16:39.476 --> 16:42.827
Dear Lord, I know
I'm not a perfect man,

16:42.871 --> 16:45.091
but pleaselet me land safely.

16:45.134 --> 16:47.136
Amen.

16:48.877 --> 16:50.922
Okay, guys, we're
approaching the jump zone.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.273
Who's ready to see if
these new chutes work?

16:53.316 --> 16:55.797
Just kidding.
They're ancient.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.061
Tina... we're up.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.237
Okay. All right.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.196
Uh...

17:03.239 --> 17:04.849
Aah. Aah.

17:04.893 --> 17:06.895
All right.

17:06.938 --> 17:11.378
Time for Tina Butler to show
the world she ain't giving up!

17:11.421 --> 17:13.380
Let's do this!

17:20.865 --> 17:22.606
Oh, hell no, I can't do it!

17:22.650 --> 17:24.347
Oh. No!

17:24.391 --> 17:26.349
I can't do it!
I can't do it!

17:26.393 --> 17:28.308
You can. Yes,
you can, Tina.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.050
Aah. Okay. Okay. All right.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.401
I'm good. I'm good.I can do it.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.841
Oh, God! Aah!

17:39.884 --> 17:42.017
Aah! No! No! Oh.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.933
Oh, no. Uh, I-I wa...

17:44.976 --> 17:46.978
I shouldn't have
brought you up here.

17:47.022 --> 17:48.545
Why did I think
I could do this?

17:48.589 --> 17:51.374
Tina, trust me,you're gonna be fine.

17:51.418 --> 17:55.030
He's right. Although by law,
we can't guarantee that.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.990
This was a stupid idea--

17:59.034 --> 18:01.863
trying to convince myself
I'm young and adventurous.

18:01.906 --> 18:05.040
I-I got to face it-- I-I-I'mtoo old, and it's too late.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.259
No, Tina,

18:06.302 --> 18:08.130
don't you talk like that.

18:08.174 --> 18:10.132
There's nothing old about you.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.352
You're just tryingto make me feel better.

18:12.395 --> 18:15.224
No... I'm not.

18:15.268 --> 18:18.271
Now, Tina, I know
that you think life is over,

18:18.314 --> 18:19.881
but it's not true.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.362
You've got
so many adventures left,

18:22.405 --> 18:24.973
and I'm gonna be
right there by your side.

18:25.016 --> 18:28.368
Like I said,
I'm your ride-or-die, baby!

18:29.934 --> 18:31.327
Calvin,you can't see it,

18:31.371 --> 18:33.329
but my goggles arefilling up with tears.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.985
So what do you say, babe?

18:37.028 --> 18:39.944
Are you ready to jump out
of this plane together?

18:39.988 --> 18:43.557
I love you, Calvin,
but you don't have to do this.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.516
Tina, I meant what I said
about standing by your side.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.911
Except for right now,
'cause I'm going first!

18:49.954 --> 18:50.999
Oh.

18:54.959 --> 18:56.961
And in case I don't make it,

18:57.005 --> 19:00.008
I got 320 bucksin my sock drawer!

19:00.051 --> 19:02.924
No, you don't! I used it
to pay for this!

19:02.967 --> 19:04.839
What?

19:07.146 --> 19:09.235
Oh.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.715
All right, Tina,
are you ready to do this?

19:11.759 --> 19:12.977
You're damn right!

19:13.021 --> 19:15.676
Now enjoy the rideon my high-sitting booty.

19:15.719 --> 19:18.635
You're flying first class!

19:25.120 --> 19:27.949
See, Tina? Isn't
this amazing?

19:27.992 --> 19:29.733
Oh, it sure is.

19:29.777 --> 19:31.170
And you're not
scared anymore?

19:31.213 --> 19:32.258
Oh, not at all.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.477
In fact,
I've never felt so peaceful.

19:37.872 --> 19:40.266
Calvin, calm down!

19:40.309 --> 19:42.920
Calm down! Oh...

19:42.964 --> 19:45.836
Calm down, Calvin!

19:45.880 --> 19:48.752
And look-- there's
Calvin and Dave below us.

19:48.796 --> 19:51.755
Oh, I wish I could seeCalvin's face right now.

19:51.799 --> 19:54.715
I bet he's loving thisas much as I am.

20:01.722 --> 20:04.290
Oh, my God, you're
worse than the owl!

20:04.333 --> 20:07.771
No! Aah! Aah!
