00:05.005 --> 00:07.758
Ms. Camila Silva, would you exchange

00:07.842 --> 00:11.846
this fondue pot
for a crystal liqueur bottle?

00:12.513 --> 00:14.390
Yes!

00:14.473 --> 00:16.434
Future Mrs. Silva da Silva,

00:16.517 --> 00:20.187
would you exchange your single life,
nights out, carnival in Salvador

00:20.354 --> 00:22.815
for a marriage with your dream man...

00:23.023 --> 00:24.442
7 YEARS AGO

00:24.525 --> 00:25.526
smart, handsome,

00:26.610 --> 00:27.778
good-smelling,

00:27.862 --> 00:30.197
who loves you more than anything?

00:31.449 --> 00:32.825
No!

00:32.908 --> 00:34.535
What?

00:38.998 --> 00:40.207
I love you, you know?

00:41.167 --> 00:42.168
I know.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.088
I have an idea.

00:46.756 --> 00:49.925
I'll ask my mother to make
that fig liqueur you love

00:50.009 --> 00:51.385
so we put it in the bottle.

00:51.469 --> 00:52.386
Perfect.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.930
We could drink it at the hospital,

00:55.014 --> 00:57.099
when you'll be screaming in pain,

00:57.808 --> 01:01.020
and I'll be crying
over the birth of our first son.

01:01.437 --> 01:02.688
Or daughter.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.107
Or daughter.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.696
What about this fondue pot?

01:12.156 --> 01:14.366
Jeez, it's nice to make fondue, huh?

01:14.450 --> 01:15.826
We only used it once.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.953
Remember we said we'd go to the country

01:18.037 --> 01:20.414
-and bring our fondue pot?
-I remember.

01:21.248 --> 01:25.920
Let's take this opportunity to get rid
of everything we don't need.

01:26.003 --> 01:27.379
Okay, give me the duck.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.216
You'll take
those My New Fabulous boxes, right?

01:32.051 --> 01:33.719
I invested so much on those.

01:34.720 --> 01:37.431
I won't even get close
to this year's top five.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.850
What? Are you gonna give up now?

01:40.100 --> 01:41.185
That's not like you.

01:42.228 --> 01:44.939
It'd take a miracle
to make my site a big hit.

01:45.314 --> 01:47.274
Well... The bread machine.

01:47.399 --> 01:49.527
I don't eat gluten anymore. Want it?

01:49.610 --> 01:52.279
-I don't know how to use it.
-I'll give it to my mom.

01:52.363 --> 01:55.115
Yes, then you tell Mrs. "You have to"

01:55.199 --> 01:57.201
she'll have to make her own bread.

01:58.911 --> 02:00.579
Okay. The peacock...

02:00.663 --> 02:01.914
-Mine.
-Mine.

02:02.414 --> 02:03.249
-Yours.
-Mine.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.129
Márcio Heleno,

02:10.005 --> 02:11.549
we need to talk.

02:11.882 --> 02:15.052
Come on, Mom, cut me some slack, please.

02:15.386 --> 02:19.557
I'm still trying to process
in my head that image

02:19.890 --> 02:22.726
I can't even talk about
because it makes me sick.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.895
Son, I'm doing hormone therapy.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.856
Mom, I don't need to know that.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.983
Okay, let's get straight to it.

02:29.441 --> 02:31.193
I want privacy.

02:31.569 --> 02:33.737
I feel at the peak of my sexual life.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.573
Why do I have to listen to this?

02:35.614 --> 02:38.701
God, don't you understand
you're my mother?

02:38.784 --> 02:42.079
Now that my new boyfriend's
coming here more often,

02:42.288 --> 02:46.834
I wanna be free to walk around
my own place naked.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.421
Don't make me picture this.
God, take this away.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.463
Stop it!

02:52.464 --> 02:54.258
It's about time you left home.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.051
Where should I go?

02:56.802 --> 02:58.012
How will I pay rent?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.266
How much do you need to leave home?

03:06.979 --> 03:10.357
Bro, you'll never convince Camila
you'll be a good tenant.

03:10.441 --> 03:13.485
-There's a line of interested people.
-Come on, man.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.862
Ask Bugs Bunny

03:14.945 --> 03:18.198
if she wouldn't rather have you
share the place with me.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.367
-Better not.
-Better not.

03:20.951 --> 03:24.246
I don't think I'll last long here
with my debts.

03:24.997 --> 03:28.000
Listen, my mom knows
an excellent fortune teller.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.378
She does spiritual cleansing,
attracts good luck and everything.

03:32.922 --> 03:33.756
Seriously.

03:35.257 --> 03:37.343
Don't worry, we'll figure this out.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.384
Not even one free drawer.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.387
Jeez, I have a weird heartburn.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.139
Lucas won't care about this baby,
I'm sure.

04:24.223 --> 04:25.557
What about me?

04:25.641 --> 04:27.559
I'll have to raise two children.

04:27.643 --> 04:29.645
Couldn't he give me a little room?

04:30.312 --> 04:32.690
I could scarf down a rice pudding now.

04:33.357 --> 04:36.485
I didn't have the time
to study his family's genetics.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.948
Oh, my God.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.701
Oh, my God!

04:44.827 --> 04:46.120
You're independent.

04:46.829 --> 04:49.999
You don't need a man
to provide for you or your child.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.418
I'll have to provide for my kid by myself?

04:52.501 --> 04:54.628
What about me? I'm by your side.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.716
Maybe it's time I grew up

04:59.717 --> 05:01.885
and started having more responsibilities.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.971
And you'll be an excellent mother.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.223
I won't need to freeze my eggs.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.559
Or look for a father with perfect DNA.

05:09.893 --> 05:10.811
A baby...

05:12.146 --> 05:14.398
-You'll be Catarina's godmother.
-Girl.

05:14.773 --> 05:16.108
Let's see the result.

05:20.946 --> 05:21.864
Negative?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.200
-Holy shit!
-Holy shit!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.665
Hi, Caco.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.709
-It's been a while.
-What's up?

05:33.834 --> 05:34.668
How are you?

05:35.044 --> 05:36.462
-I needed a favor.
-Sure.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.297
I know you really like Camila,

05:38.380 --> 05:39.923
that you know lots of people.

05:40.007 --> 05:43.677
I'd like to know if you could promote
the My New Fabulous website.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.722
<i>You're so involved</i>
<i>in the women's empowerment movement.</i>

05:47.264 --> 05:49.975
Don't call me ma'am.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.352
I'm sure your friends will relate

05:52.436 --> 05:54.688
a lot to this My New Fabulous initiative.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.023
Why am I saying this?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.525
Camila's website has an amazing offer.

05:58.609 --> 06:02.321
It's not because she's my ex,
it's because she's very competent.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.656
Send it in your mailing list.

06:04.907 --> 06:06.158
Mailing list, Caco?

06:06.825 --> 06:09.369
Did you know I lost a client
because of you?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.083
-Did anybody die?
-Yes,

06:14.458 --> 06:15.959
my irresponsibility.

06:16.085 --> 06:17.169
What's with the suit?

06:17.294 --> 06:19.922
Now I'm working with serious stuff.

06:20.089 --> 06:22.007
I had to get new clothes.

06:22.091 --> 06:23.217
What are you doing?

06:24.343 --> 06:25.177
A sure thing.

06:26.011 --> 06:26.887
Insurance.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.766
If you need, I can take a day off
and help you move.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.143
You can count on me on weekends.

06:33.268 --> 06:36.146
I'm kinda busy on weekdays,
due to the responsibility.

06:36.230 --> 06:37.314
There's no need.

06:37.397 --> 06:40.359
You know Roberto Carlos.
He hired a huge team.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.569
They'll be here early on moving day.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.780
But thanks.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.031
Sure.

06:57.501 --> 07:00.921
I told him, "Here's 100 reals."
He told me,

07:01.755 --> 07:02.714
"Come on, man,

07:02.798 --> 07:06.510
"you're giving me 100 reals
to play the violin for you?"

07:06.802 --> 07:09.805
"I'm giving it you
so you don't play ever again."

07:13.350 --> 07:14.726
Am I supposed to laugh?

07:15.602 --> 07:17.312
Very good, Ronaldo.

07:17.813 --> 07:20.357
I can't believe you worked with Preta Gil.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.151
I worked at Petrosil.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.527
Yes, Petrosil.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.322
He spits when he talks.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.949
This far, Caco?

07:29.408 --> 07:33.495
You're gonna love my food, I love cooking.

07:35.914 --> 07:36.874
Too pushy.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.334
Really?

07:39.418 --> 07:41.253
When my sales began going up,

07:42.004 --> 07:43.380
he began picking on me.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.259
He even picked on me
because of my hair color. Can you believe?

07:47.426 --> 07:48.927
What a match!

07:49.845 --> 07:52.514
You got along instantly.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.725
You must have the same ascendant.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.560
Carol,

07:56.643 --> 07:59.855
it's time you left Carlão
and shared a place with Caco.

07:59.938 --> 08:00.981
That pretty flat...

08:01.064 --> 08:02.900
-Can I be honest with you?
-Yes.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.194
You should think about this divorce thing.

08:05.277 --> 08:08.155
Sometimes it's just a silly fight, so...

08:08.322 --> 08:09.156
Take it easy.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.282
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.450
You really think so?

08:11.533 --> 08:14.328
If we break up,
we'll live together for a while.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.830
It's nice being uncoupled.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.457
It could get better.

08:18.624 --> 08:19.583
It won't.

08:26.006 --> 08:26.924
Caquito.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.133
Caquito.

08:28.258 --> 08:29.968
Caquito.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.429
-Wake up, Caquito.
-What?

08:32.512 --> 08:35.098
Guess who's in Rio de Janeiro's top five?

08:35.724 --> 08:36.558
Camila.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.060
I said you could do it.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.145
When we get something in our head,

08:40.229 --> 08:41.855
-when we...
-Camila!

08:41.980 --> 08:46.151
When we focus,
when we get something in our head...

08:48.820 --> 08:49.655
<i>Hi.</i>

08:49.738 --> 08:51.990
<i>Guess who's in Rio de Janeiro's top five?</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:55.077
-You.
-Camila.

08:55.244 --> 08:58.622
We're both gonna celebrate
because I have a surprise, too.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.791
Oh, no. This way I'll attack the fridge.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.501
Really? Go for it.

09:02.793 --> 09:03.627
Go ahead.

09:03.752 --> 09:06.505
We'll burn all those calories at home.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.966
Okay.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.218
-Kisses.
<i>-French kisses, baby.</i>

09:13.720 --> 09:16.181
French kisses.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.141
-Easy.
-I got it, Caquito.

09:26.191 --> 09:27.025
Can I?

09:31.196 --> 09:32.072
You can.

09:34.491 --> 09:35.450
What's this?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.495
Don't we need more closets,

09:38.829 --> 09:41.498
more room so we can start our family?

09:43.292 --> 09:44.501
That's impossible.

09:44.876 --> 09:45.711
I'm dreaming.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.588
Do you like it?

09:49.756 --> 09:50.924
It's wonderful.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.385
Look at the furniture.

09:53.885 --> 09:55.012
Is it included?

09:55.137 --> 09:56.138
If you want it.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.140
You're the boss.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.686
You can see the Ocean Waves from here.

10:02.769 --> 10:03.603
You can,

10:03.854 --> 10:06.732
but this one's much better
than your former condo.

10:09.901 --> 10:11.528
This apartment is amazing.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.363
This porch is huge.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.158
I'm dying to see the bedrooms.

10:19.453 --> 10:20.412
It's a duplex.

10:21.747 --> 10:22.748
-Really?
-Yeah.

10:23.999 --> 10:24.916
A duplex.

10:27.252 --> 10:30.088
I can imagine
the two of us having breakfast...

11:28.355 --> 11:29.815
Caco,

11:29.898 --> 11:31.817
We got a letter...

11:31.900 --> 11:34.277
Come ASAP!

11:41.076 --> 11:41.952
Is Caco there?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.620
He's coming. Come on in.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.039
-I got here before him.
-Close the door.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.875
I have a lot of work to do.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.839
Have you decided who's gonna live here?

11:53.922 --> 11:55.674
Not yet. Your friend's picky.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.136
I totally get him.
It's dangerous having a stranger

11:59.219 --> 12:00.220
at home.

12:00.303 --> 12:02.389
A friend of mine did this,

12:02.472 --> 12:05.934
the dude robbed him, Camila,
in his own home.

12:06.101 --> 12:08.645
He got home and his stuff was gone.

12:08.937 --> 12:12.315
My cousin got a tenant,
the girl was cooking

12:12.399 --> 12:14.192
and exploded the pressure cooker.

12:14.276 --> 12:15.318
Okay, Marcinho.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.530
Okay, pay the rent on time
and you can live here.

12:20.031 --> 12:22.993
Really? I worry about ruining
our friendship.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.163
-You're right. Forget it.
-Don't worry. That's gonna happen.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.248
I'll live here and pay in advance.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.001
That depends on this letter.

12:33.503 --> 12:35.130
I came as fast as I could.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.091
-This letter...
-Wait, Marcinho.

12:38.967 --> 12:41.344
Talk, Camila. Is this what I'm thinking?

12:42.137 --> 12:44.890
-Bro, we have to talk...
-I don't know, Caco.

12:45.140 --> 12:46.892
I couldn't open it by myself.

12:47.142 --> 12:49.311
-I told her about my cousin...
-Wait!

12:49.394 --> 12:51.646
Wait, Marcinho. We gotta deal with it.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.024
Open it.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.239
Not now, Mom. I'm sorry.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.494
Be brave. Open it.

13:08.622 --> 13:13.126
I can't believe we're losing the apartment
with just three years left to pay.

13:13.210 --> 13:16.046
What? I can't believe
we're losing my apartment.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.383
What is it, Camila? Read it.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.470
A part of Caco's settlement's out.

13:31.269 --> 13:32.395
I can't believe it!

13:39.694 --> 13:42.113
-This will be great.
-Awesome.

13:42.197 --> 13:44.115
I can't wait to see their faces.

13:44.199 --> 13:46.743
Ana will say, "So sad."

13:46.910 --> 13:49.829
-"So sorry."
-Straighten up.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.666
Look forward. Thanks. Do the face.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.459
Shut your mouth.

13:59.631 --> 14:00.840
-Jandira?
-Jandira?

14:01.383 --> 14:03.969
Hi, guys. How are you? Wanna come in?

14:04.261 --> 14:07.264
Jandira's just made a wonderful cupcake.

14:08.848 --> 14:13.144
Don't tell me you gave up the divorce
and wanna go back to playing cards?

14:13.228 --> 14:15.647
No, wait. I'm gonna shed a tear.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.736
-What are you doing here, Jandira?
-I'm glad you found out.

14:21.820 --> 14:23.780
I couldn't live this lie anymore.

14:23.947 --> 14:26.157
My body was hurting, I had insomnia.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.952
You don't know
how many times I had to hide.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.413
-You know I can't get stressed!
-I know.

14:31.705 --> 14:36.209
Could you please stop
emotionally harassing poor Jandira?

14:36.334 --> 14:39.045
She's already suffered a lot
with your divorce.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.881
Ms. Ana loves to put words in my mouth.

14:42.048 --> 14:43.383
Have I said that?

14:43.800 --> 14:46.428
Take it easy,
you don't need to get stressed.

14:47.137 --> 14:50.390
You guys from Barra work this out.
I gotta get to work.

14:53.727 --> 14:57.314
We came to say you don't need to conspire
against us anymore.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.984
My settlement's out,
I can pay what's left to pay.

15:03.320 --> 15:08.325
We knew it. We know about everything
that happens here at Ocean Waves.

15:13.788 --> 15:18.585
This is not an SUV, this is a spaceship.
Press that. Down there.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.130
-Can you feel it?
-Ventilation's down here.

15:22.255 --> 15:26.718
Air conditioning system on the seat
so you can keep cool in the summer.

15:27.677 --> 15:31.222
-So?
-That's wonderful.

15:31.473 --> 15:35.393
-Can I get five minutes by myself?
-Yes.

15:55.830 --> 15:58.917
I can't believe you sold
all the stuck products.

15:59.000 --> 16:02.003
-Nice guardian angel. Jeez.
-I'm shocked at him.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.215
What's with that face?

16:05.840 --> 16:06.966
I bought a new car.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.888
What spell is that? I want it, too.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.517
I'm leaving.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.228
We're gonna have to renew stock, right?

16:23.066 --> 16:24.734
-I'll call you, okay?
-Okay.

16:25.902 --> 16:29.114
I can't believe you spent the money
on an imported car.

16:29.197 --> 16:30.448
Isn't it too soon?

16:30.532 --> 16:33.827
It's not imported. I got an upgrade
and bought a black sedan.

16:33.910 --> 16:34.786
Meaning?

16:34.869 --> 16:38.832
I bought a better car
to increase my income on the app.

16:39.207 --> 16:40.041
That's it.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.344
What do we do with this bottle?

16:51.970 --> 16:52.971
Let's drink it.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.305
Let's do it.

16:58.685 --> 16:59.936
-For you.
-Thanks.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.857
And a toast.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.525
-Hey.
-I couldn't help it.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.906
This is really good.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.533
Yeah.

17:15.827 --> 17:17.537
We had so many plans, right?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.289
Yeah.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.376
-Do you think our marriage was a mistake?
-Of course not.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.129
During our seven-year marriage,

17:26.212 --> 17:28.590
when we were good, I was very happy.

17:28.757 --> 17:32.260
That "until death does you part" thing
is so old-fashioned.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.553
Let's drink.

17:36.306 --> 17:37.348
More, come on.

17:38.266 --> 17:39.476
Do you want it full?

17:40.310 --> 17:41.770
Careful, this is strong.

17:41.853 --> 17:42.937
Now chug.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.522
-Let's chug?
-Go.

17:44.689 --> 17:45.815
Wait.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.193
One, two, three. Go.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.155
There's some left.

17:52.238 --> 17:54.365
-There's some left.
-Let's do it together.

17:54.449 --> 17:58.203
To celebrate your settlement's release,

17:58.286 --> 18:00.622
and we managed to save our apartment.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.793
Here's to you, who managed
to be in Rio de Janeiro's top five again.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.670
I'll never forget what you did for me.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.172
That was so sweet.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.465
What did I do?

18:11.132 --> 18:12.926
You thought I wouldn't notice?

18:13.134 --> 18:16.095
All your exes promoting my website
out of the blue?

18:16.179 --> 18:19.349
The merit is all yours.
You earned it yourself.

18:20.809 --> 18:21.935
What now?

18:23.353 --> 18:24.854
Do we sell our apartment?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.649
Do we not sell it? What do you think?

18:28.775 --> 18:30.235
Now we can sell it well,

18:30.944 --> 18:31.820
no rush.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.154
No rush.

18:34.739 --> 18:35.865
-More.
-More.

18:38.576 --> 18:39.577
No...

18:40.036 --> 18:41.371
-No.
-Drink this first.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.831
-Drink this first.
-I will.

18:42.914 --> 18:44.582
-Go.
-When you do it.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.379
Drink it.

18:49.587 --> 18:50.797
Go, Caco.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.091
Go, Caco.

18:53.258 --> 18:54.551
Go!

18:58.638 --> 18:59.597
Wow!

19:12.151 --> 19:13.945
Everything's gonna be all right.

19:14.988 --> 19:15.989
It's gonna be.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.993
Tomorrow, when Marcinho gets here,

19:20.076 --> 19:21.077
and I leave,

19:21.870 --> 19:25.790
Batman and Robin
will finally be rid of the Joker.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.709
Are you excited?

19:29.502 --> 19:30.336
Yeah...

19:31.212 --> 19:32.755
It's gonna be a new stage.

19:33.214 --> 19:34.090
Yeah.

19:41.723 --> 19:42.724
Stay.

19:44.809 --> 19:46.019
Don't do this.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.730
Stay.

19:49.856 --> 19:50.857
Caco.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.151
-Don't do this.
-Stay.

19:53.359 --> 19:54.193
There's no...

20:17.592 --> 20:19.594
It's not what you're thinking.
