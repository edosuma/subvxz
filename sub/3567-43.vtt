00:27.078 --> 00:29.150
And I really like
the ones that shoot up

00:29.218 --> 00:31.853
- kind of spirally with the long tails.
- Steven, I'm slipping.

00:31.921 --> 00:34.255
- Hold that end up a little more.
- Oh. Sorry!

00:34.357 --> 00:36.057
That's okay. I'm not sure the

00:36.125 --> 00:38.960
"Summer wax special"
sign was that effective anyway,

00:39.028 --> 00:40.962
but I can't bring
myself to throw myself out.

00:41.030 --> 00:43.632
Might as well store it
for the rest of the Winter.

00:43.699 --> 00:46.067
So, which firework
is your favorite, Dad?

00:46.135 --> 00:49.638
Oh. Uh, I don't know.
I just like watching them

00:49.705 --> 00:52.140
- together with you.
- Yeah, me, too!

00:52.241 --> 00:54.576
I can't wait for
New Year's eve tomorrow.

00:54.644 --> 00:56.678
It feels like I've waited a whole year!

00:56.779 --> 01:01.117
Well, you feel that way for a reason.

01:02.184 --> 01:07.355
Mm. Mm.

01:07.423 --> 01:09.224
Hmm.

01:09.291 --> 01:12.727
Whoa!
I haven't really cleared this

01:12.828 --> 01:15.163
place out since your mom ...

01:15.231 --> 01:17.732
Maybe this is good timing ...
a new year coming up.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.768
I should just get rid of all this stuff.

01:19.835 --> 01:21.970
I could take
these off your hands.

01:22.038 --> 01:25.273
That's a start, but I'll need
a little more help than that,

01:25.341 --> 01:28.843
and this guy's not gonna do it.
Who would organize

01:28.911 --> 01:30.578
- a mess this big, though?
- Ah!

01:30.680 --> 01:32.514
I know just the gem!

01:33.135 --> 01:34.349
Here's Amethyst!

01:34.417 --> 01:37.252
- Surprise.
- Oh.

01:37.319 --> 01:39.354
- Something wrong?
- Well, no.

01:39.455 --> 01:41.823
I just thought you meant Pearl.

01:41.891 --> 01:44.192
What?!
I'm not letting Pearl see this!

01:44.260 --> 01:47.295
Amethyst's room is full of junk.
She knows how to handle a mess.

01:47.363 --> 01:50.198
- I don't know about this.
- Hey, man, it's cool.

01:50.266 --> 01:52.033
I've seen your junk before.

01:52.101 --> 01:55.203
What you need here is a system
... something to separate

01:55.304 --> 01:59.140
- the trash from the garbage.
- Well, how 'bout this?

01:59.208 --> 02:01.876
- Huh?
- I made organizational boxes.

02:01.944 --> 02:04.079
This way we can sort everything

02:04.146 --> 02:07.282
into easy categories ...
keep, sell, burn.

02:07.349 --> 02:10.085
- What do you think?
- I don't know if we should

02:10.151 --> 02:13.219
- burn anything.
- Ah, come on, Greg!?

02:13.251 --> 02:17.204
- What are you afraid of?
- Fire?

02:17.271 --> 02:21.942
- Keep. Keep. Keep.
- Whoa! Hold on.

02:22.009 --> 02:24.277
Aren't we supposed to
be throwing stuff away?

02:24.345 --> 02:27.314
Are you crazy?!
You've got some seriously good

02:27.381 --> 02:31.384
- junk in here, man, like...
- Books!

02:31.452 --> 02:34.921
- Ah. So, books are cool again.
- Yeah, ever since you

02:35.022 --> 02:37.424
guys grounded me from
TV for a thousand years.

02:37.492 --> 02:40.093
- We did what, now?
- Can I have these?

02:40.161 --> 02:42.395
Uh, hold on. Let me
see some of those first.

02:42.497 --> 02:44.581
Yeah, I think you'll like this one

02:44.582 --> 02:46.666
and this one, and, uh...

02:46.734 --> 02:49.970
maybe we'll save this one for
when you're a little older.

02:53.307 --> 02:55.075
- Ugh!
- Ha!

02:55.143 --> 02:57.310
You bought this?! Ha!

02:57.378 --> 03:00.380
Uh... I guess I don't
need these old dumbbells.

03:00.448 --> 03:04.017
Ah, come on.
Don't you want to get yoked?!

03:05.042 --> 03:08.696
Come on, Amethyst.
Knock it off.

03:09.417 --> 03:11.424
Oh, no.

03:11.492 --> 03:16.114
- How did this happen?
- A photo of you and Mom.

03:16.149 --> 03:17.864
<i>Ah, it's ... it's okay.</i>

03:17.932 --> 03:21.401
- It's just the frame.
- He-e-e-e-y!

03:21.502 --> 03:24.070
I found something that
definitely doesn't belong with

03:24.138 --> 03:27.160
- all this this junk.
- Is it the deed to my uncle's mansion?

03:27.195 --> 03:29.161
Even better.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.880
Is that... "Li'l Butler"?
Oh, where have you been

03:33.948 --> 03:37.855
- all these years?!
- # Li'l Butler, that's you #

03:37.890 --> 03:41.922
- Amethyst, what's "Li'l Butler"?
- Oh, man.

03:41.989 --> 03:44.424
Steven, we used to watch
these all the time when

03:44.492 --> 03:46.860
you were little.
You've got to see this!

03:50.831 --> 03:53.733
Hey!
I-I'm still grounded, you know!

03:53.801 --> 03:56.703
Come on.
Just one, for old times' sake.

03:56.771 --> 04:01.946

04:48.256 --> 04:51.157
Is this the pilot?
They didn't even have

04:51.225 --> 04:52.459
- the dog yet.
- Oh, yeah!

04:52.526 --> 04:55.070
They just had a cat named "Money"!

04:57.253 --> 04:59.627
Hey, Steven, it's getting pretty late.

04:59.628 --> 05:04.337
Why don't we just call it a day?
We can pick this up again tomorrow.

05:04.405 --> 05:08.341
Uh... okay.
See you tomorrow, Dad!

05:11.879 --> 05:14.180
Hey.
I'll take two breakfast-only

05:14.248 --> 05:16.316
- breakfast specials, please.
- Sure.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.885
Ronaldo! Can I get
a double order of hash browns?

05:18.953 --> 05:21.054
Yeah.
My Dad and I got a big day

05:21.122 --> 05:23.957
cleaning the storage unit.
Got to start the year off

05:24.025 --> 05:26.026
- right, you know.
- Wow! That's really

05:26.093 --> 05:28.328
practical of you, Steven.
My Dad and I are restocking

05:28.396 --> 05:30.497
all the condiments.
I get to clean the bottles.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.300
We're supposed to wash them
twice, but I always wash them

05:33.367 --> 05:36.036
three times.
Odd numbers just feel cleaner.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.205
Hey, are you going
to the New Year's

05:39.307 --> 05:41.441
- fireworks tonight?
- Yeah! It's supposed to be

05:41.509 --> 05:46.246
pretty darn spectacular!
Mayor Dewey's been setting up

05:46.314 --> 05:49.015
all morning. There
are gonna be blue ones!

05:49.083 --> 05:52.085
- I love the blue ones.
- It's gonna be so awesome.

05:53.562 --> 05:57.023
You guys? Dad?

05:57.091 --> 06:00.593
<i>I'll look like a fool if I show
up to school on just one pony!</i>

06:00.661 --> 06:05.565
<i>You people have too much money!</i>

06:05.633 --> 06:09.269
What a surprise.
Li'l Butler does it again.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.871
You can always count on Li'l B.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.159
Yeah. Everything's always

06:15.265 --> 06:17.110
right with him.
One more?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.045
- Do it!
- Hey!

06:19.113 --> 06:22.148
Oh, Steven!
What are you doing coming

06:22.216 --> 06:25.218
- over so late?
- It's... morning.

06:25.286 --> 06:27.387
Oh, wow.
I guess we lost track of the time.

06:27.455 --> 06:31.798
You never stopped
watching "Li'l Butler"?! Ugh!

06:31.833 --> 06:34.160
When you get to
season 3, it really starts

06:34.228 --> 06:36.296
getting good.
That's when the uptight

06:36.364 --> 06:38.665
neighbors, the
Richingtons, move next-door.

06:38.733 --> 06:40.967
Ha! They're a riot!

06:41.068 --> 06:44.504
<i>- Well, I never!
- Well, I always!</i>

06:45.584 --> 06:49.609
- Well, you want to get started?
- Oh, yeah.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.045
Ooh, this part is so good.

06:55.383 --> 06:57.917
I guess the
storage unit can wait.

06:57.985 --> 07:00.286
Yeah, buddy.
That sounds like a good idea.

07:00.354 --> 07:03.356
- All right! Snacks!
- Want to just meet

07:03.424 --> 07:06.393
- at the fireworks?
- Sure.

07:06.460 --> 07:10.391
Okay. I'll see you there.

07:13.267 --> 07:15.201
- Like this?
- Yeah!

07:15.269 --> 07:18.238
You guys are killin' it!
And here are some pots and pans.

07:18.305 --> 07:21.374
We got to make lots of noise.
Dad and I do this every year.

07:21.442 --> 07:23.276
I brought some for Amethyst, too.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.479
- They should be here any second.
- Why would she

07:26.547 --> 07:27.947
come with Greg?

07:28.015 --> 07:30.984
- Are they hanging out again?
- What do you mean, "again"?

07:31.051 --> 07:33.253
They'd better not be watching

07:33.320 --> 07:36.122
- that dumb show.
- "Li'l Butler"?

07:36.190 --> 07:38.558
Unbelievable!

07:38.626 --> 07:41.428
They really are! They
used to disappear for days,

07:41.495 --> 07:47.300
watching those obnoxious tapes
over and over and over, until...

07:47.368 --> 07:50.437
- Until what?
- I don't know.

07:50.538 --> 07:55.975
One day, they just stopped.

08:01.816 --> 08:04.184
Happy new year, Steven.
How's my volume?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.252
It's low.

What's that?
I'm missing the fireworks!

08:22.470 --> 08:26.540
It's past midnight! How did I get
so sucked into this show again?

08:26.541 --> 08:30.610
It's like everything else
just disappears!

08:30.678 --> 08:32.779
Whoa, whoa.
Don't go.

08:32.847 --> 08:35.748
We're having a really good time!
Here. Look.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.684
I've got the 2-part Hawaii special.

08:38.751 --> 08:42.121
But Steven really wanted
me to do New Year's.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.390
He'll be fine.
He's Steven.

08:44.492 --> 08:46.526
- He's tough.
- I wanted to be there!

08:46.594 --> 08:48.761
Here. Here.
It would have been like this.

08:48.863 --> 08:51.764
Whoa! Fireworks!

08:51.832 --> 08:54.367
Hey, Dad, come on!
Now let's watch

08:54.435 --> 08:57.303
- some "Li'l Butler"!
- Amethyst, you know how I feel

08:57.371 --> 09:00.340
- about shapeshifting.
- Geez. Sorry.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.675
I was just trying to cheer you up.

09:02.743 --> 09:07.583
Oh, that's right ... I forgot.
You're so sensitive.

09:07.618 --> 09:10.693
I know you like making me
uncomfortable, but it's not funny.

09:10.728 --> 09:12.352
I can't stay here and humor you.

09:12.419 --> 09:17.631
- I have to be there for my son.
- Well, what about me, huh?

09:17.666 --> 09:20.654
I had someone who was
always there for me

09:20.655 --> 09:22.295
until she started hanging out with you!

09:22.396 --> 09:24.497
Don't do this, Amethyst ...
seriously.

09:24.598 --> 09:27.100
I bet you'd stay for her.

09:27.167 --> 09:30.666
- You wouldn't.
- What? Do this?

09:30.701 --> 09:33.673
<i>- Where are you going after Hawaii?
- Hey, Greg</i>

09:33.741 --> 09:37.343
<i>Turn around.
Check it out!</i>

09:37.411 --> 09:40.613
I know you're doing it!
I want to be friends again.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.383
I really do.
But I can't let you do this

09:43.450 --> 09:45.718
- to me again!
- Stop!

09:50.891 --> 09:53.026
What are you two doing?!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.597
I get it.
It's hard to deal with stuff

09:57.665 --> 10:00.567
from the past.
You want to put it off because

10:00.668 --> 10:03.797
there's tons of it
and it's really heavy and it means

10:03.804 --> 10:06.482
a lot to you,
so it's hard to let anything go.

10:06.548 --> 10:10.109
But you got to,
because this thing is full!

10:10.177 --> 10:13.680
Seriously, when did
you even have a cat?!

10:23.556 --> 10:26.392
Okay.
We're finishing this today.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.736
Right.
What? Pearl?

10:29.771 --> 10:33.140
Hello, Greg.
Nice of you to join us.

10:33.175 --> 10:35.401
- I don't believe it!
- Whoa!

10:35.502 --> 10:40.239
- I'm so sorry about the mess.
- Was this... your idea?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.520
- Well...
- It was Amethyst's idea.

10:45.911 --> 10:47.580
I-I just thought we

10:47.648 --> 10:49.716
could take all this
stuff back to the temple.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.151
It can fit in my room.
That way, you don't have

10:52.252 --> 10:57.066
to throw anything away.
But ... But you can keep this.

11:00.461 --> 11:04.196
Uh... thank you, Amethyst.
