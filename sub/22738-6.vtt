MAN:
All SDPD units reminded to stay

00:17.618 --> 00:19.320
on DEA channel 13.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.489
Operation Prairie Dog
is our operation now.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.124
Hold your positions.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.659
You'll be updated
when you need to know.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.428
TOLBECK:
So, my cousin Betsy,

00:27.461 --> 00:29.263
who's married to John,

00:29.297 --> 00:31.599
told me that John's aunt

00:31.632 --> 00:33.601
spontaneously combusted.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.337
Can you believe that?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.539
Can I believe that...

00:38.572 --> 00:40.441
your cousin's auntie
spontaneously combusted?

00:40.474 --> 00:41.675
No, I can't.

00:41.709 --> 00:42.810
Because it's not a thing.

00:42.843 --> 00:44.245
Well, it's rare.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.246
It's not rare.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.680
It's just not real.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.216
Look, I read some stories
in the newspaper about it.

00:48.249 --> 00:49.617
In the 18th century
one of the first people...

00:49.650 --> 00:51.352
Okay, stop. Just stop.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.754
Not engaging with the
spontaneous combustion thing.

00:53.787 --> 00:56.290
Okay? 'Cause it's not real.
It's not a thing, okay?

00:56.324 --> 00:59.127
I put up with a lot of garbage
in this car, and there it is.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.129
We found the line.
We found it together.

01:01.162 --> 01:02.796
Congratulations, us.
Game over.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.765
All right, then. Wow.

01:04.798 --> 01:06.434
What's going on with you?

01:06.467 --> 01:07.835
Yeah.thing okay?

01:07.868 --> 01:09.603
Things okay with Fatima?

01:11.205 --> 01:12.840
Did anything happen?

01:12.873 --> 01:15.176
No, nothing happened.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.311
You know what?
Somebody in this car

01:17.345 --> 01:19.580
needs to be cheered up.

01:19.613 --> 01:21.849
I got a surprise
for you, really.

01:21.882 --> 01:23.851
Close your eyes, okay?

01:23.884 --> 01:25.553
Close your eyes.

01:25.586 --> 01:27.455
And... open them.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.689
Well, you didn't close them.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.691
Anyway, surprise.

01:30.724 --> 01:32.860
I made some,
uh, Sri Lankan

01:32.893 --> 01:36.197
Okay, okay, oh.

01:36.230 --> 01:37.831
Do not open that lid.
If you open this,

01:37.865 --> 01:39.333
the smell will
get in this car,

01:39.367 --> 01:40.601
and it will
never come out.

01:40.634 --> 01:44.905
I'm serious.mean...

01:44.938 --> 01:47.408
Do not open this
Okay.Tolbeck, okay?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.877
Yeah.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.680
Just, I spent all night
I know.this for you.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.348
Then you were in a bad mood.
I thought maybe some curry

01:54.382 --> 01:55.683
I know.heer you up.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.917
But I guess
I know.ust wrong.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.419
Well, I guess
I will just throw it

01:58.452 --> 01:59.753
into the garbage
or something.

01:59.787 --> 02:00.888
Oh, God.'t matter.

02:00.921 --> 02:02.756
Tolbeck, I think
we need a break.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.292
Oh, yeah, you know what?

02:04.325 --> 02:05.693
I was just thinking
about that the other day.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.928
My cousin, he has a cabin
up in Lake Tahoe.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.530
We could get it
for a weekend.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.864
No, no, no, no.
I mean...

02:10.898 --> 02:13.867
break apart...
from each other.

02:14.902 --> 02:17.738
Um... wow.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.340
I-I'm trying
to move forward.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.841
I'm trying
to get ahead,

02:20.874 --> 02:22.843
and I-I'm just stagnant here.

02:22.876 --> 02:26.480
I'm-I'm just, my feet
are stuck in concrete.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.349
And I think, really,

02:28.382 --> 02:30.651
you know, you-you...
you're a great guy.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.653
I mean, you'll have no
problem finding a partner.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.622
You'll probably have lots
of partners, you know?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.657
You'll probably be out there
having a different partner

02:36.690 --> 02:38.892
every-every-every
detail, you know?

02:38.926 --> 02:40.494
You'll end up thanking me,

02:40.528 --> 02:42.263
and I'll end up being
jealous of you guys.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.664
I'm telling you.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
It's gonna happen,
Yeah.now?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.235
'Cause you're--
you are a great guy.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.802
Okay. Thank you.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.271
Yeah.ou okay?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.505
I'm fine.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.773
Thanks for being
honest with me.

02:52.806 --> 02:55.276
Oh, that's good.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.944
Well, it is lunchtime,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.512
No, no, no.a eat my...

02:58.546 --> 02:59.680
Please, please.
Tolbeck, come on.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.415
Come on. We're
still friends.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.251
We're always
Will we? friends.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.785
Of course we will.
Of course we...

03:04.818 --> 03:07.655
Don't, please don't
do that. Please-- oh.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.989
Yeah.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.558
Oh, come on.

03:10.591 --> 03:13.827
That is the smell
of betrayal, my friend.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.364
Be-trayal.

03:16.397 --> 03:19.433
("Happiness, Missouri"
by El Vy playing)

03:19.467 --> 03:23.003
* While away while
someone counts the minutes *

03:23.036 --> 03:27.708
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off *

03:27.741 --> 03:31.512
* By the way,
I told you we were in this *

03:31.545 --> 03:35.549
* Happiness, Missouri,
I got to get your mind off it. *

03:35.583 --> 03:37.585
*

03:55.769 --> 03:59.873
So she's wailing away
about how smart her dog is,

03:59.907 --> 04:02.009
and I'm like, "Really?"

04:02.042 --> 04:04.412
Is he always like this?

04:04.445 --> 04:08.416
Does not stop... ever.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.650
Oof.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.319
He's killing me, man.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.953
Yeah?

04:12.986 --> 04:15.756
Yeah.

04:15.789 --> 04:18.592
All right...
All right.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.361
All right what?

04:20.394 --> 04:23.030
ADRIAN:
Okay, and don't get me
started on dolphins.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.665
What have they ever done?

04:30.771 --> 04:33.641
You look familiar to me.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.908
You a Burner?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.577
You go to Burning Man?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.046
Oh, no.
Never been. You?

04:39.079 --> 04:40.648
I never miss it.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.350
Yeah.

04:42.383 --> 04:45.018
Yeah, yeah. I guess somehow
that makes sense.

04:45.052 --> 04:46.487
No, I never miss it.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.357
Yeah. I wouldn't think so.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.791
Not once.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.394
Yeah.

04:53.427 --> 04:55.062
Just something
Mm-hmm.e, mm-hmm.

04:55.095 --> 04:56.797
Okay?t.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.066
You know,
just so you know,

04:59.099 --> 05:01.502
I don't know how to say this,
so I'm just gonna say it.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.036
I've become quite

05:03.070 --> 05:05.673
a robust role model
for Angus here.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.940
Huh.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.942
Nope. Not a role model at all.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.911
Said every son ever.

05:10.944 --> 05:13.414
No, but talking
real here...

05:13.447 --> 05:14.915
we've gotten pretty close.

05:14.948 --> 05:16.384
And, uh...

05:16.417 --> 05:19.553
ain't nobody...
gonna break that up.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.655
Ours is more of
a work relationship.

05:21.689 --> 05:22.890
Partners.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.825
Not anymore, though.
Right?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.627
How's that?

05:26.660 --> 05:27.795
You're just visiting, though.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.929
Right Yes.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.431
No, I'm back, baby.

05:30.464 --> 05:31.532
I don't want to say
you're replaced.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.566
I'm not gonna say that.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.734
No, I haven't been.

05:33.767 --> 05:34.902
Nope.

05:34.935 --> 05:37.571
But... you kinda have been.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.507
Yeah, except I'm
here now on the job.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.908
Sure.re here.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.043
And we appreciate the visit.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.978
The point is,
Marco,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.080
you were there for him.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.916
Oh, yeah.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.518
And I really appreciate that.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.586
And I appreciate you

05:52.620 --> 05:54.455
being there for him
when I couldn't be.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.456
All right.m here for him.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.425
Yeah. No. Absolutely.

05:57.458 --> 05:59.460
And it's good.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.094
It's good for

06:01.128 --> 06:02.696
to have those
people in his life

06:02.730 --> 06:03.997
that matter to him.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.433
That look out for him.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.468
What the fuck is this?
What

06:07.501 --> 06:09.369
You know what

06:12.640 --> 06:14.141
All right,
what's going on?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.709
Come on.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.711
Let's just sit down.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.481
Once again.dy on their box.

06:24.051 --> 06:26.787
So, Marco, how's your ear?

06:32.025 --> 06:34.495
CoNo.on.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.896
I didn't mean
right away, Tolbeck.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.498
I'm just talking
about, like, the next case.

06:37.531 --> 06:38.966
No, no.w?

06:38.999 --> 06:40.568
I should've seen
this coming.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.503
I knew it.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.705
Why should you have seen
this coming? Come on.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.907
Your obsession
with Agent Haldeman.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.642
Look. Do I think he's
a great cop

06:48.676 --> 06:50.711
Yeah, yeah.
He's a great cop.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.980
Okay?
Do I admire his work?

06:53.013 --> 06:54.982
Yeah, I admire his work,
all right.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.651
It doesn't necessarily mean
I want to partner with him.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.654
Good. Because you would
look ridiculous.

07:00.688 --> 07:02.222
You don't think that
every cop on the force

07:02.255 --> 07:04.224
wants to partner with him?

07:04.257 --> 07:05.993
Proper cops, too.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.595
They're probably all just
throwing themselves at him.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.797
Look, he's just
a colleague, okay?

07:09.830 --> 07:11.599
I don't thi

07:11.632 --> 07:12.900
Oh, my God.
Crow in my window.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.067
Fuck me.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.536
What the...?

07:15.569 --> 07:17.237
Okay. Oh, my goodness.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.072
You had to put the
windows down, didn't you?

07:19.106 --> 07:20.808
Oh

07:20.841 --> 07:21.909
Who stank up with car
with the fish curry?

07:21.942 --> 07:22.910
That's why he's here.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.913
Just be still,
and it'll fly away.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.080
Where's the fish curry?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.215
It's, uh,
down by my feet.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.517
Okay, okay, okay.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.218
Just lean down, okay?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.953
Grab the curry,

07:32.986 --> 07:34.522
and throw it out of the car
and he'll follow it.

07:34.555 --> 07:36.056
I'm not gonna lean
down there and be--

07:36.089 --> 07:37.525
Okay. peck my eyes out.

07:37.558 --> 07:39.192
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

07:39.226 --> 07:40.828
I'm telling you,
What?is an omen.

07:40.861 --> 07:42.229
You know, you talk
about breaking us up,

07:42.262 --> 07:44.097
and then all of a sudden
you roll the windows down,

07:44.131 --> 07:46.834
and a big black evil bird
car.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.802
Oh, yeah, sure, that's
what's happened here.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.839
This is an omen.
You're an omen, okay?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.674
Could we just be
absolutely quiet, please?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.982
FATIMA:
Yeah, I just adopted a dog.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.884
It's a pugbackman.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.253
Yeah.backman?

08:06.286 --> 08:07.988
Mmm. a specialty breed.

08:08.021 --> 08:10.090
It's a cross between a pug,

08:10.123 --> 08:13.093
Rhodesian ridgeback
Oh. Doberman.

08:13.126 --> 08:15.262
Yeah, let me
Yeah, let's see.re.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.897
Oh, God.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.599
He's Sprinkles.

08:18.632 --> 08:20.868
Here you go.t's on fire.

08:20.901 --> 08:22.235
A little closer look.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.671
Isn't he cute?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.005
What's wrong
with his jaw?

08:25.038 --> 08:26.974
It's missing.ean?

08:27.007 --> 08:28.241
No, it's there.

08:28.275 --> 08:29.743
It's just a little bit
of an underbite.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.111
That's a characteristic
of the breed.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.682
Geez. Boy, what's
going on with his eyes?

08:34.715 --> 08:36.116
His big beautiful eyes?

08:36.149 --> 08:37.751
Well, they're going
in opposite directions.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.153
Well, he's...
pretty light-sensitive,

08:40.187 --> 08:42.322
so his eyes are, like,
always moving around

08:42.355 --> 08:44.692
in different directions
to avoid the sun.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.226
But he also has
to keep his head down

08:46.259 --> 08:47.861
because he's sort of...

08:47.895 --> 08:49.830
built on an incline.

08:49.863 --> 08:52.265
Yeah. He's like a wheelbarrow.

08:52.299 --> 08:53.734
I guess there is one problem.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.035
It's, like, little.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.870
Yeah, I, uh...

08:56.904 --> 08:58.338
Okay.

08:58.371 --> 09:01.775
I can't ever get his lipstick

09:01.809 --> 09:03.644
to go away, really.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.913
Well, it doesn't go back in,
so I have to...

09:05.946 --> 09:08.649
I have to kind of
manually put it back in,

09:08.682 --> 09:10.183
And how do you do that?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.052
Well, I-I talked to the vet.
I got some lube.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.254
And I just, you know, kind of...

09:14.287 --> 09:15.923
put it back in the sheath.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.358
And how often
Ten... have to do that?

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
times a daA day?!n't even...

09:20.828 --> 09:22.663
You're reverse
jacking that dog off

09:22.696 --> 09:24.364
Yeah.imes a day?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.899
He needs a little help.

09:25.933 --> 09:28.335
I mean, medically he's got,
like, the holster

09:28.368 --> 09:30.337
of a pug but, you know...

09:30.370 --> 09:32.072
the weapon of a Doberman.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.875
Yeah.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.176
He's a little terror.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.878
Yeah. He's a
terror, all right.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.179
Mm-hmm.monster.

09:39.212 --> 09:42.683
A little baby monster.
He's funny.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.384
TOLBECK:
Uh, Dispatch, this is Car 27.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.986
Come in,Oh, God.

09:46.019 --> 09:47.921
Car 27, go ahead.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.222
Car 27.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.158
We have a crow in the car. Over.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.160
JANICE:
What

09:54.962 --> 09:55.996
It's about...

09:56.029 --> 09:57.798
17 inches tall.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.399
Black feathers, black beak,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.401
black eyes, black...

10:01.434 --> 10:03.203
feet?

10:03.236 --> 10:04.672
Talons.s.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.073
JANICE:
Yeah, I know what a fucking crow

10:06.106 --> 10:07.908
looks like. What do
you want me to do?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.009
Send in the SWAT team?

10:09.042 --> 10:10.243
Uh, maybe you could send

10:10.277 --> 10:11.679
Animal Control?

10:11.712 --> 10:13.914
He has a very aggressive energy
right now.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.082
Over.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.249
JANICE:
We've got real work to do.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.985
Okay? Dispatch out.

10:19.019 --> 10:19.920
Cup of tea?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.354
Yeah, that sounds good.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.956
Janice. Janice.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.992
The crow is not leaving
the vehicle. Over.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.146
You hungry?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.749
By the way,ing.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.150
I've been holding on
to all these receipts.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
Who do I talk to
to get 'em reimbursed?

10:52.185 --> 10:54.121
No, Adrian,
there's no reimbursements.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.122
That's not how this works.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.256
You know what?

10:56.289 --> 10:58.158
Angus, why don't you
go grab tacos?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.292
Give Adrian a break here.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.728
I don't have any money.

11:00.761 --> 11:01.895
I do need some money from you.

11:01.929 --> 11:03.296
All right. Here I go again.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.265
Bank of Adrian.
Open for business.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.000
No, seriously.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.435
It's all right.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.770
Thank you.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.071
I spoil him way too much.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.907
Okay.Eight carne asadas.

11:16.910 --> 11:19.179
Hey, you want to hear a secret?

11:21.114 --> 11:22.916
I'm about to be a Wow.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.418
You guys... talked about it,

11:25.452 --> 11:27.287
We talk... Oh, yeah.'re going?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.156
We've talked
Oh, yeah?endlessly.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.924
We had plenty of time 'cause,
you know, we took our time.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.192
ReaYep.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.794
Yeah.
Don't want to rush into things.

11:33.827 --> 11:35.295
Great.nd easy.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.930
Yeah.

11:36.964 --> 11:38.065
Yeah, first two months,

11:38.098 --> 11:39.800
all we did was soak.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.268
What's that now?

11:41.301 --> 11:42.502
We soaked.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.204
Like, in a tub?

11:44.237 --> 11:45.338
In a sexual way.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.874
Oh. Okay.

11:46.907 --> 11:48.108
I don't get it.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.442
No. don't?

11:49.476 --> 11:51.044
Soak

11:51.078 --> 11:52.479
To soak?

11:52.512 --> 11:54.214
Okay, no. I've never heard it.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.083
It's where the man
just rests his penis

11:56.116 --> 11:57.484
inside the woman's vagina.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.019
That's it?
Yes.just rest it there?

11:59.052 --> 12:01.088
Sexual?t rest it there.

12:01.121 --> 12:03.423
But there's no movement.
There's no...

12:03.456 --> 12:05.793
There's no movement.
There's no thrusting?

12:05.826 --> 12:07.094
So, are you even erect?

12:07.127 --> 12:08.962
You're Oh, you are?

12:08.996 --> 12:11.965
Just, like, tucking your dick
into a vagina bed for a nap.

12:11.999 --> 12:15.135
Yeah. That's the best way
I've ever heard it described.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.236
Yeah.t, okay.

12:16.269 --> 12:17.537
Yeah, no, I guess I get it.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.239
It's a bit of an art form.
Yeah, very popular

12:19.272 --> 12:20.540
in, uh, Mormon youth circles.

12:20.573 --> 12:22.042
Oh, interesting.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.911
It's spreading. Yeah.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.513
You've never been
to a soak bar before?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.481
No.

12:34.187 --> 12:36.990
FATIMA:
Aw, Sprinkle's so cute.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.526
I set up a camera in the house
so I can watch him all day.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.462
Well, why don't you just,
uh... continue that,

12:42.495 --> 12:44.131
and I'll handle all
the pesky police work?

12:44.164 --> 12:45.565
Not a pet person?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.167
No, not at all.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.136
Really

12:49.169 --> 12:51.939
Well, um, I had a snake once.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.841
A sYeah.

12:53.874 --> 12:56.109
It was something, uh, Mason
wanted for his eighth birthday.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.412
And his father--
my husband, Wally-- and I said,

12:59.446 --> 13:02.115
"Absolutely not. No snakes."

13:02.149 --> 13:04.952
Right? So, one day
I'm in the bathroom,

13:04.985 --> 13:06.386
and, uh, I look down,
and in the trash can,

13:06.419 --> 13:08.989
I see a condom wrapper.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.291
I mean, immediately
I saw flashes of red.

13:11.324 --> 13:12.993
So I talked to
Wally about it.

13:13.026 --> 13:15.562
He's denying it,
we get in this huge argument,

13:15.595 --> 13:16.997
like, really loud.

13:17.030 --> 13:18.531
I glance over,
and I see Mason

13:18.565 --> 13:20.433
with just tears
coming down his face.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.002
Poor kid had to witness
that argument.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.403
So I felt bad.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.572
The next day I get up,
I go to the pet store,

13:25.605 --> 13:28.141
I get the snake, I get a tank,
and I have to get a heater.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.912
Right? Then the guy tells me
snakes eat frozen mice.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.046
All Frozen mice?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.447
Yeah, frozen mice.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.183
So then, one day I notice
that Trevor--

13:36.216 --> 13:37.918
that's the snake's name--
isn't eating these frozen mice.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.452
The guy
at the pet store told me,

13:39.486 --> 13:40.921
"Yeah, that happens sometimes.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.189
So you have to get real mice."
Right?

13:42.222 --> 13:43.390
So, here I am, going--

13:43.423 --> 13:45.125
driving back and forth
to the pet store,

13:45.158 --> 13:46.593
buying fresh mice. And let
me tell you something.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.061
I don't want the reputation

13:48.095 --> 13:49.529
of someone who's buying
a lot of mice, right?

13:49.562 --> 13:51.198
So I'm trying to go
to different pet stores.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.599
You know, like alcoholics,
they don't buy liquor

13:52.632 --> 13:54.134
in the same store. Right?

13:54.167 --> 13:55.635
So, here I am driving
to all these pet stores,

13:55.668 --> 13:58.071
and then they tell me,
"You got to sprinkle

13:58.105 --> 14:00.340
a little calcium powder
on these mice."

14:00.373 --> 14:02.943
You know, it gives it
protein. So, here I am,

14:02.976 --> 14:05.078
tossing this little spice
on top of the live mice

14:05.112 --> 14:06.246
and dangling it
Ew.r the little...

14:06.279 --> 14:07.614
Yeah. The little aquarium

14:07.647 --> 14:09.216
for the snake
to get. Right?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.084
Unbelievable. At this point,

14:11.118 --> 14:14.354
Mason has lost complete interest
in the snake. I don't blame him.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.323
So, now it's all of
a sudden my snake.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.058
And then one day

14:18.091 --> 14:19.226
I get home from my shift,

14:19.259 --> 14:21.228
and I completely forgot
to buy the mice.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.930
You know? Because at this point,

14:22.963 --> 14:24.965
all I've been doing
is arguing with Wally,

14:24.998 --> 14:26.099
so the last thing
on my mind

14:26.133 --> 14:27.935
is a mouse, rYeah.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.169
So, I get back in the car,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.471
and I go, like,
40 miles out of my way...

14:31.504 --> 14:33.974
...to find alive mice, 'cause
all the stores are out of them

14:34.007 --> 14:35.208
because I'd been buying them.

14:35.242 --> 14:36.476
Okay? So, then
I get baGeez.

14:36.509 --> 14:37.978
...into the house,
I'm dangling it

14:38.011 --> 14:39.646
over the little cage,
and I'm thinking,

14:39.679 --> 14:41.648
"What the hell is going on?

14:41.681 --> 14:43.650
Is this really my life?"

14:43.683 --> 14:44.985
You know, it was
like one of those

14:45.018 --> 14:46.386
"movie of the
week" moments...

14:46.419 --> 14:48.521
...where I actually caught
a glimpse of myself, you know,

14:48.555 --> 14:50.390
in the reflection of the tank,
Yeah.'m like...

14:50.423 --> 14:52.259
"Is this who I am?"

14:52.292 --> 14:54.494
I don't-- you know,
Wally's not happy,

14:54.527 --> 14:56.629
Mason's not happy,
I'm not happy,

14:56.663 --> 14:59.232
and Trevor's not happy.
So you know what I did?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.701
I put my clothes back on,
I set Trevor loose,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.237
I divorced Wally,
and I kept the mice.

15:04.271 --> 15:07.007
Wow. That is incredible.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.308
Yeah.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.609
How are the mice?

15:09.642 --> 15:11.311
Well, they didn't
last that long.

15:11.344 --> 15:12.679
One mouse ended up
eating all the mice,

15:12.712 --> 15:14.314
so I took revenge, and I...

15:14.347 --> 15:15.515
I killed it.

15:15.548 --> 15:19.219
I killed it,
and then I...

15:19.252 --> 15:21.521
stuffed it, and it was living
on my mantle for a while,

15:21.554 --> 15:23.723
and then I got...
a moth problem,

15:23.756 --> 15:26.126
and all the moths
ended up eating it,

15:26.159 --> 15:29.129
so I just have the base
of the taxidermy thing.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.098
You know, you can
use little currants

15:31.131 --> 15:32.332
for the eyeballs.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.134
Pretty effective.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.137
But, yeah.
No, I don't have any pets.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.439
Hey.

15:39.472 --> 15:42.542
Just curious.
Do you think that maybe...

15:42.575 --> 15:46.279
Mason was
behind the whole thing?

15:46.313 --> 15:47.547
You know, like,

15:47.580 --> 15:50.350
he planted
the condom wrapper.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.585
He was there
witnessing you both fighting.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.421
He wanted the snake all along.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.523
He knew you'd get it for him.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.691
Wait a minute.
You're saying that...

15:58.725 --> 16:00.760
Mason planted the condom?

16:00.793 --> 16:03.663
So, he would destroy
our entire relationship

16:03.696 --> 16:05.432
just to own a snake?

16:05.465 --> 16:07.600
Yes.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.336
But I'm no detective.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.204
Yeah. No, you're
not a detective.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.573
Mm-mm.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.743
Do you want
some coffee, uh...?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.645
Yeah, no. Just give me a second.

16:20.647 --> 16:23.083
CULLEN:
Okay, okay.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.617
He's

16:24.651 --> 16:27.154
Oh, yeah. Great idea. leave?

16:27.187 --> 16:28.621
Why don't we leave it here

16:28.655 --> 16:30.190
with the keys to the
car, guns and badges.

16:30.223 --> 16:32.225
No. This is our car, okay?

16:32.259 --> 16:33.460
He's leaving.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.628
I'm just gonna coerce it gently

16:35.662 --> 16:37.230
out your window, all right?

16:37.264 --> 16:39.199
Why?don't push him towards me.

16:39.232 --> 16:40.567
Because crows have AIDS.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.768
That's not true.

16:41.801 --> 16:43.303
Yes, it is.
They have AIDS.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.371
They just don't have any way

16:44.404 --> 16:45.772
to transmit it to human beings.

16:45.805 --> 16:48.241
All right, why aren't
they all dead of AIDS?

16:48.275 --> 16:50.077
Because they've evolved.
They know how to live with it.

16:50.110 --> 16:52.079
Okay, so they can't transmit it.
They know how to live with it.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.413
How is it AIDS?

16:53.446 --> 16:55.482
No, it's zero-blown AIDS.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.784
Okay, it's AIDS light.
They don't even

16:57.817 --> 16:59.619
Oh, what do they call it?

17:00.820 --> 17:02.522
Do you want to push it out?

17:02.555 --> 17:03.823
No. So lean back.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.426
Here we go.
Here we... oh, ow.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.261
Here we go. Get it!
No, no, no!atch it.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.396
No, no, no!dly)

17:09.429 --> 17:10.497
ut of the...

17:10.530 --> 17:11.764
Ooh! it!

17:11.798 --> 17:13.366
Uh-oh.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.702
Is it okay?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.405
No.

17:18.438 --> 17:20.407
That's dead.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.409
That's full-blown dead.

17:22.442 --> 17:26.813
Okay, we better get
our story straight.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.249
ADRIAN: So, yeah,
I got a young sperm age.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.550
MARCO:
Oh.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.419
Yeah. Great.
Well, that's good.

17:32.452 --> 17:33.820
I'm really happy
for you and Vanessa.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.423
One might even say
my dick has the Midas touch.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.825
What do you mean
by "the Midas touch"?

17:38.858 --> 17:41.561
'Cause everything my dick
touches turns to gold.

17:41.594 --> 17:43.296
Oh, goodness.
Well, that's terrible.

17:43.330 --> 17:44.564
I'm so sorry to hear that.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.765
You're sorry?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.634
Yeah. Well, the Midas touch

17:47.667 --> 17:50.770
in the story of King Midas
is a curse.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.173
No, everything he touches
turns to gold.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.775
Yeah, it's a morality tale.
I-It's so that people understand

17:55.808 --> 17:58.578
that they should not be greedy,
they should not want everything

17:58.611 --> 18:01.314
But he's super wealthy.
He can do anything he wants.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.183
But i-in the story--
oh, Adrian--

18:03.216 --> 18:06.786
in the story, everything he
touches literally turns to gold.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.388
His food.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.890
His drink. His daughter.

18:10.923 --> 18:13.860
His penis, when it touches
No. His-- no.they turn to gold.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.828
Yeah. hey turn to gold. Yes.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.664
And gold babies come out.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.499
No! They're dead.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.401
He...'s nothing in that story...

18:21.434 --> 18:24.504
He kills everything
...abouthe loves.d babies.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.905
With his penis?

18:25.938 --> 18:27.874
No, no. In the story,
it's not his...

18:27.907 --> 18:31.311
In the story, it's his touch,

18:31.344 --> 18:33.446
his touch, not his penis.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.482
You're appropriating it
for your penis.

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
Wow, I can't even...
What am I doing?

18:37.350 --> 18:39.352
Okay, anyway, the point being,

18:39.386 --> 18:42.189
at the end of the story,
the curse is such

18:42.222 --> 18:44.191
that he has lost everything

18:44.224 --> 18:46.893
and, in fact, starves to death.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.896
That's the result
of the Midas touch.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.465
It's a curse!

18:52.499 --> 18:54.467
That's your interpretation.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.236
No, it's not my interpretation!

18:56.269 --> 18:57.604
That's the fucking story!

18:57.637 --> 18:59.639
That's how it works!

19:03.776 --> 19:05.645
I mean, he must've been

19:05.678 --> 19:07.480
a really old bird,
you know?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.549
He lived
a really good, fun life.

19:09.582 --> 19:12.252
I don't think so.
Why do you say that?

19:12.285 --> 19:14.454
'Cause, you know,
he didn't move that quickly.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.756
He didn't move th...
He was all over you.

19:16.789 --> 19:18.491
He was very nimble.
You just nailed him.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.893
Yeah, well,ncredible shot.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.262
it was an accident.

19:22.295 --> 19:24.631
Really? 'Cause
you, you know...

19:24.664 --> 19:25.932
you hit him
with a weapon.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.667
My flashlight.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.936
Basically, you applied
lethal force to the victim

19:29.969 --> 19:32.239
with a deadly weapon.

19:32.272 --> 19:34.541
Well, he came into our home.
This car is our home.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.944
It's not like I went into
his habitat and did it there.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.813
Well, a bird's habitat is
the air, and, technically,

19:40.847 --> 19:43.716
he was in the air
when you murdered him.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.287
This is not good.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.422
You know whWhat

19:49.456 --> 19:50.923
We should burn the body.

19:50.957 --> 19:52.425
No, we're not
burning the body.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.694
No, we should burn the body.
Look, crows

19:54.727 --> 19:56.296
are really smart, okay?

19:56.329 --> 19:58.298
If he has a mate,
the mate

19:58.331 --> 19:59.666
will find the corpse.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.301
So we burn it.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.935
So now we can look forward
to a life of looking

20:02.969 --> 20:04.704
over our shoulder
in case some crow with AIDS

20:04.737 --> 20:05.938
comes seeking retribution.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.308
Yes. Unless we burn the body.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.842
Don't underestimate crows.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.844
They are smarter
than apes.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.980
They know stuff.
They share information.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.615
This thing's dead, okay?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.984
That's the end of it.
End of story, all right?

20:18.017 --> 20:19.419
Okay.

20:19.452 --> 20:20.987
Okay.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.423
I'm gonna get some takeout.
You want something?

20:23.456 --> 20:24.857
Uh... no.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.459
I'm just gonna eat
the curry.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.860
Do not eat the
curry in the car.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.862
And do not burn
that crow.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.399
Okay, I won't.
Okay?'t.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.467
Okay, I'm gonna hold you
to that. And I trustOkay.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.002
I trustOkay.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.504
Okay.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.750
Even in light
of everything you said,

20:50.783 --> 20:53.486
I still like to think
my penis has the Midas touch.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.323
What Why?
Why would you want that?

20:56.356 --> 20:58.891
Why would you want... Obviously,

20:58.925 --> 21:00.893
I'm getting worked up!
Why would you want your dick

21:00.927 --> 21:03.062
to have the Midas touch?
Then everybody you fucked

21:03.095 --> 21:05.965
would turn to gold.
Would you want that?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.001
If you soaked with someone,
they'd turn to solid gold.

21:09.035 --> 21:11.771
Doesn't Really?ad to me.

21:11.804 --> 21:13.606
That person would then be dead.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.909
Can you think of a cooler way of
going out, leaving this Earth?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.778
By turning into a gold statue?

21:18.811 --> 21:20.747
What would be cooler than that?

21:20.780 --> 21:22.048
"Hey, what happened to Pete?"

21:22.081 --> 21:24.016
"He's dead."

21:24.050 --> 21:26.486
Pete... So you fucked Pete
Yeah.is story. Okay, so, great.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.355
So now Pete's dead
'cause you fucked him.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.490
And you think he's
psyched about that?

21:30.523 --> 21:32.625
I think his buddies are like,

21:32.659 --> 21:34.794
High

21:34.827 --> 21:36.663
I don't like
you, man.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.065
I don't like you.

21:39.098 --> 21:42.034
Are we having a problem
right now?

21:43.069 --> 21:44.904
Yeah, Adrian.

21:44.937 --> 21:48.408
Yeah, we might be having
a problem right now.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.724
Oh, boy. No.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.427
MAN: Can I get...

22:07.460 --> 22:10.530

23:09.789 --> 23:11.023
But I can't do anything,

23:11.057 --> 23:13.626

you know, family.

23:13.660 --> 23:15.628
I mean, my guy's not family,
but, uh,

23:15.662 --> 23:17.997

We're just hauling up

We are truck drivers.

Yeah. drivers. That's-that's...

I mean, I hate it.
The union's fighting it.

'cause I'm always away from
home, so she's calling.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.685
You know, she's got a
temper. She's exotic.

24:12.719 --> 24:13.920
Really?...

24:13.953 --> 24:16.222
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
she's fiery.

That's fun.
