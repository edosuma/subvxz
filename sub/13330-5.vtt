WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:03.235
.

00:07.273 --> 00:10.744
We're back in our playground
and that means fucking chaos.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.146
Bigger and better than ever.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.981
Bucking, birds and banter.

00:15.048 --> 00:17.684
Two new housemates.
I've got first dibs.

00:17.751 --> 00:20.787
I grill more birds
than George Foreman. Alreet?

00:20.854 --> 00:24.524
I'm young, I'm fresh
and I love bucking birds. (cheering)

00:25.792 --> 00:27.093
That went perfectly.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.397
Charlotte thought "What the fuck
am I doing in Gary's bed?"

00:30.463 --> 00:31.865
This is a disaster.

00:31.931 --> 00:33.266
(cheering)

00:33.333 --> 00:36.636
Me and Joel,
we have been through ups and downs.

00:36.703 --> 00:40.907
The biggest argument ever. Engagement
party's been a fucking joke.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.009
It all ends in tears.
(smashing)

00:43.076 --> 00:44.477
I'm still in shock.

00:45.645 --> 00:49.149
Where's the fucking fanny?
Last thing I need is to be near her.

00:49.215 --> 00:53.219
I know she's got an apology but
I'm not ready. Vicky, please, man.

00:53.286 --> 00:56.256
There's a black cloud over
everything that makes us happy.

00:56.322 --> 00:58.858
We are enjoying looking like tramps.

00:58.925 --> 01:02.662
They're touching each other places
that should be in the bedroom.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.532
Someone is definitely getting
hashtagged Gazzed.

01:07.434 --> 01:11.771
I have a degree in pulling.
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:11.838 --> 01:14.207
Look up "pull it" in the dictionary.

01:14.274 --> 01:18.211
I'd never kiss anyone without a
six-pack. I'll tear the place up.

01:18.278 --> 01:22.248
I talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, the charm.

01:22.315 --> 01:26.853
I'm fit, flirty with double Fs.
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.088
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:38.565 --> 01:44.237
# "Teenage Icon" - The Vaccines

01:46.639 --> 01:48.541
This morning we're fucking hanging.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.778
(chattering)
I'm not going for a bloody work-out!

01:51.845 --> 01:56.049
The lads decided this is the perfect
time to drag us to the gym.

01:56.115 --> 01:59.285
On the treadmills and all.
(mock cries)

01:59.352 --> 02:02.322
(blows raspberry) Fuck off.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.456
Get up.

02:03.523 --> 02:08.461
On a scale of one to ten,
I'd say I was four and a half fit

02:08.527 --> 02:10.663
and six and half fat.

02:10.729 --> 02:12.999
That adds to 11, shit.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.300
Get up, man.

02:14.367 --> 02:16.703
Lasses bang on about being on diets

02:16.769 --> 02:20.039
but every single night out it's
like kebabs, burgers, pizzas,

02:20.106 --> 02:21.941
it's their own fucking fault.

02:22.008 --> 02:23.676
Let's go.

02:24.677 --> 02:27.247
So, you're OK?

02:36.923 --> 02:39.926
Ricci, you count.
I'm too tired.

02:40.927 --> 02:42.462
(squeals)

02:42.529 --> 02:46.499
I've got James
as me personal trainer. (groans)

02:46.566 --> 02:50.937
Now it isn't really the work-out
that I'm use to doing with James.

02:51.004 --> 02:54.073
We're just friends,
I've got to settle for push-ups.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.644
The girls are doing all right

02:57.710 --> 03:02.348
but all they wanna do is go home
and jump on a random cock.

03:02.415 --> 03:06.419
How much nicer is it in the house
now? Atmosphere's completely changed

03:06.486 --> 03:08.388
The meal last night, I was buzzing.

03:08.454 --> 03:13.426
It's mint we're back together as one
big fucked up, dysfunctional family.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.161
(laughing)

03:17.530 --> 03:18.898
(cheering)

03:18.965 --> 03:21.668
Got ya!
I'm seeing Dan at the gym

03:21.734 --> 03:27.807
so you'd think I'd be either kinda
nervous excited to see him or awkward

03:27.874 --> 03:30.109
but it's just a bit blank.

03:30.176 --> 03:34.681
Holly, you're letting your man down.
She won't even play him at ping-pong

03:34.747 --> 03:38.284
Gonna go read me magazine now.
Can you read?

03:38.351 --> 03:42.789
Tell him I can read. She can read
but she struggles with bigger words.

03:42.855 --> 03:46.125
I'm not thick. There's more
important things in life,

03:46.192 --> 03:47.627
like washing your hair.

03:54.334 --> 03:57.503
(doorbell rings)
Doorbell.

04:00.173 --> 04:04.143
Someone's sent this massive girly
bunch of fucking shit flowers.

04:04.210 --> 04:05.979
I feel a tit holding them.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.947
Guess who they're for.
Me?

04:08.014 --> 04:10.083
Do you reckon?
Don't know, doesn't say.

04:10.149 --> 04:12.118
Why would they be for me?

04:12.185 --> 04:14.387
I'm as surprised as everyone.

04:14.454 --> 04:19.291
Only time we get presents is when
Charlotte doesn't flush the toilet.

04:19.358 --> 04:21.027
Oh, it's Joel.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.428
(girls) Awww.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.497
"Dear Sophie,
thinking of you every minute.

04:24.564 --> 04:27.667
I'm counting down the days
till I see you again.

04:27.734 --> 04:31.404
Got nobody here to squeeze
my spots any more, ha." (laughter)

04:31.471 --> 04:35.775
Joel's never ever sent me flowers
before and this is just proof

04:35.842 --> 04:38.745
to me and everyone
that he does love us.

04:38.811 --> 04:42.281
It's about time he fucking sends us
something, he's a fucking ****!

04:42.348 --> 04:47.587
# "The Salmon Dance"
- The Chemical Brothers

04:47.654 --> 04:51.290
Scramble and Egg are growing up
so fast, they're almost teenagers.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.761
I'm concerned how Scramble
and Egg are gonna grow up

04:54.827 --> 04:56.429
with Charlotte as their mother.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.899
Let's go to the aquarium
to learn how to look after fish.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.403
We're gonna go to the aquarium
and show her how serious

05:03.469 --> 05:05.405
fish welfare actually is.

05:05.471 --> 05:08.741
Do you not wanna go?
I fucking hate fish. Suck us off!

05:08.808 --> 05:12.045
There'll be sea horses there
and everything. Sea horses? Yeah.

05:13.112 --> 05:14.347
Whey-aye, man.

05:26.426 --> 05:28.594
Eurgh, what the hell is that?

05:33.032 --> 05:36.135
We have the aquarius tour guide,
walking around with us,

05:36.202 --> 05:38.571
filling our heads with facts
on fish.

05:51.350 --> 05:53.653
Eeee, he's bucking him.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.388
(laughter)

05:55.455 --> 05:57.256
Sea creatures love bucking.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.926
That's clever considering
their genitals are inside.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.796
They're just game as fuck.
Doggy style. Crabby style.

06:03.863 --> 06:07.767
The aquarium is like a massive,
great big fish brothel.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.703
Look at them.
Them two are definitely bucking.

06:10.770 --> 06:12.438
Look, it's kicking off!

06:18.478 --> 06:20.847
Are they that big?
No, just the colour.

06:23.149 --> 06:27.820
Cleaning them too often, there's
natural bacteria in the tank.

06:27.887 --> 06:32.625
After to today I can take so much
home and put it straight into action

06:32.692 --> 06:34.594
and better Scramble and Egg's life.

06:42.201 --> 06:45.571
I'm talking to Vicky about
how I'm single and how I'm coping.

07:00.086 --> 07:04.357
I don't know where to go. I miss
Scott. He hasn't been in touch.

07:24.443 --> 07:28.848
It's mint that Dan's come with us but
he's looking a bit fucking miserable.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.216
He needs a bang.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.086
We'll help you, you know Dan,
if you want. Gonna help us?

07:34.153 --> 07:37.824
So I wanna help Dan
and I wanna help him pull.

07:37.890 --> 07:41.427
Find you a nice girl. Are they
for real? I don't need help.

07:41.494 --> 07:43.963
She's all right, blondie down there.

07:44.030 --> 07:48.401
So there's a good opportunity
at the aquarium and I think,

07:48.467 --> 07:50.937
"Maybe I could get this lad a date."

07:51.003 --> 07:54.373
There's that girl. Don't look.
The girl that works here.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.076
Why don't we ask her if she's single

07:57.143 --> 08:00.346
and if she can go on a date
with Dan.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.982
Are they blind?
I've been pulling girls.

08:03.049 --> 08:08.187
You don't laugh and giggle when we
do it. I'm gonna act professional.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.256
Lauren, are you single?

08:10.323 --> 08:14.527
Er, no I've got a boyfriend,
why you asking? It was just...

08:14.594 --> 08:16.829
Do you know Dan?
Dan, yeah.

08:16.896 --> 08:21.267
Dan was just saying... He wants to,
like, take girls on dates. Right.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.338
I appreciate the gesture but yes,
I'm taken, unfortunately.

08:25.404 --> 08:27.506
He's a lucky man.
Oh, yeah.

08:27.573 --> 08:31.611
For once in me life I'm actually
bored of the cock. Let's go.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.947
See you later. Thank you.
Tell your boyfriend we said hi.

08:35.014 --> 08:38.985
Tried to see if she was single,
to go on a date.

08:39.051 --> 08:43.188
I tell the prick and he's sitting
with a face like a smacked arse.

08:43.256 --> 08:47.059
I don't need help pulling birds.
I can do it perfectly fine.

08:47.126 --> 08:51.330
I tried to get him a date. He'd
better turn that frown upside down,

08:51.397 --> 08:54.667
the cheeky bastard
cos I only tried to fucking help.

08:54.734 --> 08:57.770
I don't blame the lass,
Dan is fucking rank.

08:57.837 --> 09:00.740
Safe to say,
I'll never speak to her again.

09:00.806 --> 09:03.209
Should we go? Yeah.
Let's go.

09:10.683 --> 09:14.186
After the aquarium, me and Ricci
decide to spend some time together

09:14.253 --> 09:15.855
and we go for a walk.

09:15.922 --> 09:19.625
I think everyone's getting on,
it's really nice. Yeah, it is.

09:19.692 --> 09:23.496
I still feel like Dan's maybe
a bit out of the loop.

09:23.562 --> 09:26.098
It's hard cos everyone's
giving him pointers

09:26.165 --> 09:30.169
and giving him, like, little nudges
to help him and stuff.

09:30.236 --> 09:33.005
To help him fit in and that?
Yeah.

09:33.072 --> 09:39.245
And he is young, he's only 19 but
there's only so much help you can...

09:39.312 --> 09:40.813
Stole one

09:42.315 --> 09:44.317
Hello, mate, you OK?
Aye, mate.

09:47.119 --> 09:50.489
Why don't I plan your stag do,
you plan my hen do?

09:50.556 --> 09:54.827
I'm so excited about me wedding.
I'm like every girl. Had it planned

09:54.894 --> 09:59.565
since I was five and I know how I
want, down to the very last detail.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.801
(laughs) Where would you send us?

10:01.867 --> 10:04.437
Skegness.
Skegness.

10:04.503 --> 10:07.540
I'm absolutely buzzing, I can't wait
to see her walking down the aisle.

10:07.606 --> 10:10.009
And now to celebrate our love,

10:10.076 --> 10:14.547
I'm going to have the most
ostentatious wedding in the world.

10:14.613 --> 10:18.517
It's the only time I'm gonna do it.
I want it to be massive.

10:18.584 --> 10:23.055
I want everyone to have a brilliant
time. I want me postman there.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.658
There will be no expense spared

10:25.725 --> 10:30.363
because the father of the groom
pays for everything. No. Yes.

10:30.429 --> 10:32.398
That's just how it is.

10:32.465 --> 10:37.970
It's all about the Bs, banter,
birds, bungalow, bucking, bosh.

10:38.037 --> 10:40.606
Gonna pull some birds,
take someone back. Shock!

10:40.673 --> 10:43.209
Drink after drink after drink.

10:43.275 --> 10:46.379
I'm not gonna let him
fucking ruin my night.

10:46.445 --> 10:49.915
You're a fucking arsehole!
You're a fucking psycho!

10:51.550 --> 10:53.853
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

10:58.758 --> 11:00.760
.

11:10.903 --> 11:12.905
It's Monday night, going to Bijoux.

11:14.273 --> 11:16.842
We're gonna get fucking mortal,
shock.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.848
I haven't been pissed in ages
so tonight I'm gonna have fun.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.484
It's all about the Bs,

11:25.551 --> 11:30.589
Bijoux, birds, banter, back,
bungalow, bucking, bang, bosh.

11:32.091 --> 11:35.428
Everybody's dressed up
and I cannot wait to go out

11:35.494 --> 11:38.931
sink a couple of Jaegerbombs,
have a dance and a laugh.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.801
Gonna fucking pull some birds,
take someone back.

11:44.103 --> 11:46.272
We getting in this one lads?

11:52.945 --> 11:54.547
Hi.
You all right?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.883
(cheering)

12:01.921 --> 12:05.825
The lads are giving us pep talks
on how to pull birds,

12:05.891 --> 12:09.128
are they fucking serious?
They're in no position to.

12:09.195 --> 12:12.865
I'm gonna pull the next thing I see
to shut everybody up.

12:15.801 --> 12:18.804
Dan seems more relaxed,
he's having a good night.

12:18.871 --> 12:22.541
He's pulled himself a bird,
honestly, I'm buzzing for the kid.

12:22.608 --> 12:25.311
I think he's got a bit
of Gary's fever.

12:27.746 --> 12:32.284
He's got a girl with the biggest
synthetic wig I've seen in me life.

12:32.351 --> 12:34.186
She looks like a 70-year-old

12:34.253 --> 12:38.190
that's tried to dress as her mam.
But Dan wants a shag.

12:43.229 --> 12:47.066
Straight away I know
she's game as fuck for coming back.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.334
This is too easy.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.138
Straight away I get two wicked
little blondies over.

12:52.204 --> 12:55.341
I'm cracking on with one,
Gaz graft her mate.

12:55.407 --> 12:58.344
When me and Scott are out,
we think the same,

12:58.410 --> 13:03.349
we act the same, our intentions are
the same. Makes things times easier.

13:08.554 --> 13:11.323
I don't know how far Gaz and Scott

13:11.390 --> 13:14.627
are gonna take their relationship
before announcing they're a couple.

13:17.429 --> 13:21.734
Whenever Charlotte tries to get
with a boy, Gary cock-blocks her.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.602
Charlotte's
turning the tables round.

13:25.771 --> 13:28.574
She's going up to the girls
and cock-blocking Gary.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.011
Surprise, surprise, she's pissed,
she's sticking her nose in.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.746
She's getting involved.

13:40.119 --> 13:43.889
And Gary looks absolutely
pissed right off.

13:46.325 --> 13:48.427
Charlotte will not leave Gary alone.

13:48.494 --> 13:52.431
It's all happening again,
getting upset when Gary pulls.

13:55.601 --> 13:59.505
I'm offering the girls a drink,
I'm making them at home.

13:59.572 --> 14:03.809
I'm just being really, really,
really overly nice and sarcastic.

14:03.876 --> 14:08.080
I can tell in Gary's eye's
he hates every single second of it.

14:15.454 --> 14:18.824
Everybody's drinking, having
a good time, atmosphere's amazing.

14:18.891 --> 14:22.061
I'm dancing, having fun.
But Ricci doesn't seem right,

14:22.127 --> 14:24.930
there's something wrong
and I don't know what.

14:29.835 --> 14:33.172
Alcohol's supposed to make you happy
but for strange reason

14:33.239 --> 14:36.775
it has the opposite effect on Ricci
and makes him jealous.

14:39.245 --> 14:42.581
Ricci's drinking a lot
and I know what's gonna happen.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.717
I'm not gonna let him ruin my night.

14:46.652 --> 14:49.288
Knocking drink after drink

14:52.191 --> 14:53.959
Making me ten times worse.

14:54.994 --> 14:59.698
I've never ever seen him this bad.
I thought it was going too well.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.969
I've got no clue what I've done.
Maybe I looked at someone wrong.

15:04.036 --> 15:06.705
Maybe I spoke
to someone I shouldn't.

15:06.772 --> 15:09.775
Maybe I danced in a provocative way.

15:10.843 --> 15:11.944
Fuck knows.

15:16.048 --> 15:20.486
I suddenly snap
and I take it all out of Vicky.

15:20.552 --> 15:25.024
You've been flirting with him
all night. You fucking arsehole!

15:25.090 --> 15:26.292
Go away.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.261
I love you.
It's a bit fucking late!

15:29.328 --> 15:33.999
I'm trying to calm him down. But
there's no reasoning with the kid.

15:34.066 --> 15:37.803
I don't wanna be in the same car
cos you're being nasty.

15:37.870 --> 15:41.740
He's making a massive deal
over nothing as per.

15:41.807 --> 15:46.879
Can you go? Want us to go? Ricci,
please go in your own taxi. I will.

15:46.945 --> 15:48.614
Taxi! Hey!

15:49.615 --> 15:53.519
When he gets in that mood
there's nothing I can do.

15:53.585 --> 15:56.322
It's as if he shuts off
to everything.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.290
He's a fucking bell-end.

16:00.793 --> 16:03.062
I think everyone, when they argue,

16:03.128 --> 16:05.531
knows how to push
each other's buttons

16:05.597 --> 16:08.434
and we know exactly how to do that.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.575
We get back
and Ricci's just not letting go.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.278
I don't flirt with bouncers
all fucking night!

16:19.345 --> 16:21.246
I never.
You fucking did!

16:21.313 --> 16:24.316
I'm fucking foaming
that he'd accuse me of flirting.

16:24.383 --> 16:26.585
I'm gonna snap if he's not careful.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.255
You've shouted at me for no reason,
you've embarrassed. I haven't.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.125
I said I love you.
You are a liar!

16:33.192 --> 16:36.261
I love you,
I've asked you to marry us.

16:36.328 --> 16:40.466
Yesterday I was sitting making plans
for me wedding and know look at us.

16:40.532 --> 16:44.803
The fact of the matter is you caused
every argument we had this evening.

16:44.870 --> 16:48.640
We're very jealous and we both
keep each other on our toes.

16:48.707 --> 16:50.509
Go fuck yourself!
I love you.

16:50.576 --> 16:53.145
I'm not as stupid
as I was in Cancun.

16:53.212 --> 16:56.215
I'm not gonna let everyone think
I'm the fucking psycho.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.083
You're a fucking arsehole.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.453
You're a fucking psycho! Look at you!

17:01.520 --> 17:04.690
I can't be with this version of him.

17:04.757 --> 17:05.958

pulling me hair, biting me lip,

scratching me chest.
That's OK with me.

What the fuck happened last night?
What were they even arguing over?

19:35.440 --> 19:37.442
It was something about her flirting.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.914
Is that why he kicked off? But she
was with us, she wasn't flirting.

I'm not gonna have me life

He's thrown all of his toys
out of the pram.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.863
I'm not fucking picking them up.

22:18.236 --> 22:22.908
It'll kill us, but I know when he
calms down it will kill him as well.

the same mistakes again.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.978
What the fuck?

23:00.045 --> 23:04.549
I came back to speak to him,
he didn't think he was in the wrong

23:04.616 --> 23:07.185
he wanted to fucking forget
about it all.

23:10.889 --> 23:13.258

together, I'm envious.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.246
You do have a good relationship,
you are lush together.

23:34.312 --> 23:37.749

It's just the drink.

23:44.055 --> 23:45.423
See you later, mate.

23:47.993 --> 23:50.662
He took me ring.
Oh, did he?

23:50.729 --> 23:52.998
Then he threw it back at us.

23:53.064 --> 23:56.568
So I've still got it.

30:03.067 --> 30:05.570
I've got this beautiful boy here,

30:05.637 --> 30:08.573
he's giving me all the complements
under the sun

30:08.640 --> 30:10.909
and I still don't like him.

30:10.975 --> 30:14.212
What the fuck?
Everybody loves a dickhead. Why?

30:18.950 --> 30:22.787
I've spotted Natalia, she's fit. Fuck
it, I'm going home with her again.

30:25.056 --> 30:29.661
Me wingman is letting us down. What
the fuck, is he losing his touch?

30:29.727 --> 30:34.332
Same bird, two nights. Next he'll be
taking his kids to the fucking park.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.201
He's ruining my reputation here.

30:36.267 --> 30:39.637
There's a funny smell
and I think it's me.

30:39.704 --> 30:42.006
And it's not coming from me vagina.

30:43.975 --> 30:46.544
It's coming from my cleverage.

30:46.611 --> 30:49.414
(screams)

30:49.480 --> 30:51.983
Sophie rubs her cleavage and says,
"Smell this"

30:52.050 --> 30:55.620
and I'm like,
"Ugh! Why does it smell like onion?"

30:55.687 --> 30:58.323
I'm sweating out raw onion
right now.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.792
Ugh. Hashtag lifting.

31:12.971 --> 31:15.506
I've brought Natalia back
because, to be fair,

31:15.573 --> 31:19.677
recycling birds is not a crime.
As long as you don't fall in love.

31:19.744 --> 31:22.580
After all that
he didn't even bang her.

31:22.647 --> 31:28.786
He went back and fucking cuddled her
Buck squad? Hashtag, cuddle squad.

31:30.455 --> 31:32.557
We're having a barbeque in the rain.

31:32.624 --> 31:36.160
There's no chance I'm getting
the comb-over wet. (doorbell)

31:36.227 --> 31:38.496
Joel's not looking like a prick.

31:38.563 --> 31:41.165
It's international men's night.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.500
(shouts)

31:42.567 --> 31:45.203
I'm on a rampage. Fuck it!

31:45.270 --> 31:48.373
Psycho Charlotte is back.
(screams)

31:48.439 --> 31:50.842
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

31:55.813 --> 31:57.815
.

32:03.788 --> 32:06.057
(groaning)

32:06.124 --> 32:08.526
(groans)

32:10.962 --> 32:13.898
Good night last night, Holl?
Fucking shite.

32:13.965 --> 32:17.502
I hear you have a, er,...
A lover. A lover.

32:17.568 --> 32:19.404
He'll be proposing next week.

32:19.470 --> 32:24.108
Don't get me wrong Dan, is such a
nice lad and he's so complementary.

32:24.175 --> 32:28.446
There's only so many time he can say
I'm gorgeous. I don't like it.

32:28.513 --> 32:32.784
He went, "Well, I fancy you and that
leads to love doesn't it?" Ugh!

32:32.850 --> 32:35.920
Dan is being so keen towards Holly.

32:35.987 --> 32:39.557
"I won't love you", he was like,
"I'll make you love me." Ugh!

32:39.624 --> 32:43.328
Oh, my, God,
"I'll make you love me."

32:43.394 --> 32:45.463
I think Holly would ruin him.

32:46.564 --> 32:49.500
The simple fact is
that Dan couldn't handle Holly.

32:49.567 --> 32:52.103
Is she a fucking demon
in the bedroom?

32:52.170 --> 32:56.174
Nah, she makes some fucking rascal
noises like, like whale noises.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.876
Like (mimics whale, laughs).

32:58.943 --> 33:03.981
Five minutes and he says he loves
you. He needs a punch in the face.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.417
Who the fuck do men think they are?

33:06.484 --> 33:10.254
Think they can snap their fingers
and we'll come running. Fuck off!

33:10.321 --> 33:12.690
(doorbell)

33:16.561 --> 33:20.365
The door goes, Sophie gets it,
she's coming into me room with

33:20.431 --> 33:23.668
this bouquet held above her head
like the fucking Olympic torch.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.336
They're for you.

33:25.403 --> 33:26.704
Oh!

33:26.771 --> 33:28.706
Inside there's a note from Ricci

33:28.773 --> 33:33.544
and straight away I feel dead
emotional because this is the most

33:33.611 --> 33:35.813
I've ever seen him write.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.449
"I hope you're OK
and everything's going well.

33:38.516 --> 33:42.120
I said I finished it but that was
in the heat of the moment."

33:42.186 --> 33:45.656
It's something he's wrote and
it's heart-felt. It's not perfect,

33:45.723 --> 33:48.292
it's still nice to know he's sorry.

33:48.359 --> 33:51.062
"I love you so much,
more than anything.

33:51.129 --> 33:54.565
I want nothing more than a puppy,
house and little Ricci's."

33:54.632 --> 33:57.168
This note and the flowers
and the apology

33:57.235 --> 34:00.238
seems to suggest
that he's on the right track.

34:00.304 --> 34:03.908
We're fucking nowhere near there.
But we're on the right track.

34:03.975 --> 34:08.679
I miss you. Why on earth, like,
would you say we're finished?

34:08.746 --> 34:10.481
I've been fucking devastated.

34:10.547 --> 34:15.119
I hate being here without Ricci,
it's like half of us is missing.

34:15.186 --> 34:18.623
Do you even think
anything you did was wrong? Yeah.

34:18.688 --> 34:21.626
You do?
Aye. Good.

34:21.692 --> 34:26.097
Things are going to change and we
are gonna be better. Yeah, I know.

34:26.164 --> 34:29.500
Yeah, you know?
Yes.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.869
Good. I've gotta go.

34:33.404 --> 34:36.607
We've got a barbeque, a few drinks,
decorate the house,

34:36.674 --> 34:40.478
have a laugh and everyone
have a big barbeque as a family.

34:42.547 --> 34:46.717
In typical Geordie style we are
having a barbeque today in the rain.

34:46.784 --> 34:51.322
# "Killer" - Fazer

34:51.389 --> 34:53.458
I'm gonna put palm trees everywhere,

34:53.524 --> 34:57.094
get some Hawaiian garlands and I'm
just gonna fucking get pissed.

34:57.161 --> 35:00.498
I can do them.
And forget it's raining.

35:00.565 --> 35:02.333
Hopefully Joel can have a good time.

35:02.400 --> 35:05.803
Have a couple of drinks,
maybe a cheeky night out.

35:07.805 --> 35:11.309
We'll do the barbeque another day,
fucking cook it in a pan.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.245
The lads
declare the barbeque won't work.

35:14.312 --> 35:18.282
There's no chance I'm getting the
comb-over wet and looking like

35:18.349 --> 35:20.051
a fucking permed poodle

35:20.117 --> 35:23.054
It won't work.
Come fucking running in with their

35:23.120 --> 35:26.057
tampon strings hanging out
to use the fucking hob.

35:26.123 --> 35:28.960
I don't think so lads, out me way.

35:29.026 --> 35:32.063
Sophie, we're having the barbeque
out here.

35:32.129 --> 35:34.365
(gasps)
OK, push it the other way.

35:34.432 --> 35:37.502
Are we leaving the girls
in charge of a barbeque?

35:37.568 --> 35:41.305
Oh!
Why does she make sex noises?

35:41.372 --> 35:43.608
Fucking suck me off!

35:43.674 --> 35:49.347
If that isn't perfectly cooked meat,
I don't know what is. Wow. Yes.

35:49.413 --> 35:50.915
It's going so well.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.319
But they actually taste like shit.

35:55.386 --> 35:58.122
Spit it in the garden,
that's what everyone would do.

35:58.189 --> 36:00.658
(doorbell)
Ding-dong.

36:00.725 --> 36:01.926
The doorbell goes.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.596
Nice to meet you, man.
I'm Scott. Who the fuck's this kid?

36:05.663 --> 36:08.399
Babe, how are you?
Hey beautiful.

36:09.467 --> 36:13.404
I'm buzzing to see him,
the smile comes straight on me face.

36:13.471 --> 36:15.373
I'm cheesy now, I'm in love.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.842
All right, Gaz. How you doing, man?

36:17.909 --> 36:22.547
For once Joel's strolled in not
topless and not looking like a prick.

36:22.613 --> 36:27.051
I'm looking forward to seeing Joel
tonight but then am I?

36:27.118 --> 36:29.887
He always does something
to put his foot in it.

36:29.954 --> 36:34.125
Joel won't come out cos his fake tan
will run. Thank fuck for the rain.

36:34.191 --> 36:35.960
Love you, Joely.

36:39.030 --> 36:42.900
It's international men's night.
It's the best night of the week.

36:42.967 --> 36:46.003
Why would I want to go out
on a Wednesday

36:46.070 --> 36:50.107
to a place called International
Men's Night? I'd rather chew glass.

36:50.174 --> 36:53.611
Suck me off.
Fucking get in! (shrieks)

36:53.678 --> 36:57.682
It seems logical in our state,
in fact obvious,

36:57.748 --> 37:00.785
that we should go dressed
as international men.

37:00.851 --> 37:02.620
I decided to go as Italy.

37:02.687 --> 37:08.426
With me hat and me pasta
and I'm gonna draw a moustache on.

37:08.492 --> 37:13.497
In homage to my fiance,
Holly decides to go as America.

37:13.564 --> 37:14.765
And Charlotte...

37:14.832 --> 37:17.735
Oh, my God, I look so African.
(laughs)

37:17.802 --> 37:20.404
Can't be arsed to tell her
it's a continent.

37:24.108 --> 37:31.048
To me, it looks like a fucking zoo
gone wrong. (laughing)

37:31.115 --> 37:34.085
It's international men's night.

37:34.151 --> 37:38.489
# International men's night
Oh, oh, oh

37:38.556 --> 37:42.093
Pointless going out on international
men's night on a Wednesday. Exactly.

37:42.159 --> 37:44.895
I'll go out
on international women's night.

37:44.962 --> 37:47.331
Even the Buck Squad
needs a night off.

37:54.071 --> 37:56.207
I'm looking like
a drunk Super Mario,

37:56.273 --> 37:58.976
Holly looks like
just an American tourist,

37:59.043 --> 38:03.347
Charlotte looks like Bet Lynch and
the Lion King threw up all over her.

38:03.414 --> 38:07.251
We're ready for these international
males and there's nowt.

38:07.318 --> 38:09.387
Not one
fucking international sausage.

38:09.453 --> 38:13.090
The four original girls.
The four original girls.

38:15.993 --> 38:18.529
Sometimes it's nice
not having the girls around

38:18.596 --> 38:20.865
cos we've got the hot tub.

38:20.931 --> 38:25.002
Even though all the girls have got
into the international male spirit,

38:25.069 --> 38:27.772
Sophie and Joel
haven't quite got into it.

38:27.838 --> 38:30.341
Unless there's a country
called Twat.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.409
(laughing)

38:31.475 --> 38:35.379
I still don't know what to make of
Sophie and Joel's relationship.

38:35.446 --> 38:39.450
He's been an absolute bastard
in the past. But he's stuck around.

38:39.517 --> 38:42.520
Do you think it is the real deal?

38:42.586 --> 38:45.623
So much shit has happened with Joel,
I don't trust him.

38:45.690 --> 38:48.859
Mate,
I still to this day can't buy it.

38:48.926 --> 38:51.095
Don't know why Sophie
still trusts him.

39:01.038 --> 39:04.308
The three most famous,

39:04.375 --> 39:08.646
arguably the most famous monuments

39:08.713 --> 39:11.382
in New York are?

39:11.449 --> 39:14.819
In my inebriated state
I decided to test the girls

39:14.885 --> 39:16.921
on the countries they're dressed as.

39:16.987 --> 39:18.622
(shrieks)

39:18.689 --> 39:21.459
Statue of Liberty,... the apple.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.228
Yeah and?
And... and...

39:24.295 --> 39:28.899
No, no, no! I'm not going to give
you the apple. I'm not, I'm not.

39:28.966 --> 39:29.967
Charlotte?

39:30.034 --> 39:32.069
Statue of Liberty, Twin Towers.

39:32.136 --> 39:35.106
They're not there any more,
inappropriate.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.042
Statue of Liberty,...

39:39.043 --> 39:42.012
The White House!
Oh, my God, that's Washington.

39:42.079 --> 39:45.716
Even I am shocked
at just how thick they are.

39:45.783 --> 39:51.222
Grab all the clocks and set them all
to go off at different times

39:51.288 --> 39:53.524
and just hide them round the room.

39:53.591 --> 39:57.895
Dan's came up with this mint idea to
play a practical joke on the girls.

39:57.962 --> 40:01.332
Fucking hell, he is good
for more than making sandwiches.

40:01.398 --> 40:05.402
I reckon six, ten past, 20 past,
half past, 20 to.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.705
There must be about
eight alarm clocks.

40:07.772 --> 40:10.374
They'll be so angry.
We'll be pissing ourselves.

40:10.441 --> 40:13.077
Set them all off at the same time.
(ringing)

40:13.144 --> 40:16.480
They are going to hate us tomorrow,
like. Fucking hell.

40:16.547 --> 40:20.384
(laughing) I'll wedge it so tight
they can't get it off.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.687
They'll wake up to an early
alarm clock fucking disco.

40:23.754 --> 40:26.490
(ringing)
(laughing)

40:26.557 --> 40:30.895
The hair. Like waiting for Christmas
morning, this is gonna be mint.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.965
We're so fucking alone.

40:35.032 --> 40:36.400
In all me self-pity,

40:36.467 --> 40:39.470
I'd forgot that Charlotte's
going through a tough time.

40:41.872 --> 40:44.642
I'm really, really drunk
and watching Sophie

40:44.708 --> 40:49.446
and Joel on the sofa is making me
think about Gary and Scott.

40:56.153 --> 40:59.557
What is wrong with us?
I think I'm missing Scott.

40:59.623 --> 41:02.326
(giggles)

41:04.128 --> 41:06.363
I've had a brilliant night.
I'm mortal,

41:06.430 --> 41:10.935
the girls are smashed, I still look
like twat but it's time to go.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.578
So we get back to the house,

41:20.644 --> 41:25.149
it's time to get into bed with me
boyfriend, have sexual intercourse.

41:26.450 --> 41:28.052
That's not fair.

41:28.118 --> 41:31.989
It's obvious that breaking up with
Scott, getting into bed with Gary

41:32.056 --> 41:34.258
has just come bubbling to the
surface.

41:34.325 --> 41:37.695
(shouts) Joel! Doing nothing!

41:37.761 --> 41:40.331
I'm getting angry and frustrated
about what's happened

41:40.397 --> 41:42.967
and how everything's turned out
with me and Scott.

41:43.033 --> 41:46.604
I just need to take me anger out
on something. (shouts)

41:46.670 --> 41:49.673
Her anguish leads her
to smash the house up.

41:52.109 --> 41:54.545
It is mad hearing Charlotte
kicking off,

41:54.612 --> 41:59.683
screaming, trashing the house and for
once I've got nothing to do with it.

42:06.090 --> 42:09.260
I'm so angry,
I can't stop smashing things up,

42:09.326 --> 42:11.829
the girls are trying to stop us.

42:11.896 --> 42:15.900
I'm on a rampage. I'm the angriest
African on the plains of Africa.

42:15.966 --> 42:18.736
I'M NOT VERY NICE EITHER!

42:19.803 --> 42:23.040
She is fucking on one,
nothing is safe.

42:23.107 --> 42:24.608
Babe, I fucking...

42:27.344 --> 42:31.916
She's going this mental now, wait
till she fucking wakes up at 6am.

42:35.052 --> 42:38.622
She's smashed the phone box,
the lamp, the water cooler,

42:38.689 --> 42:42.026
she's going fucking nuts.
Psycho Charlotte is back.

42:42.092 --> 42:44.495
Aaaaggghhh! Aaaaggghhhh!

42:45.829 --> 42:48.866
She's gotta have retribution
for behaving like a psychopath

42:48.933 --> 42:52.369
Not happy. I'm sorry.
Sorry isn't good enough.

42:52.436 --> 42:56.240
Smell the fake tan, Ireland.
We're going to Dublin!

42:56.307 --> 42:58.943
We've planned
a massive surprise for him.

42:59.009 --> 43:01.445
Fucking buzzing,
this has made my birthday.

43:01.512 --> 43:05.082
I haven't got a vibrator. Nothing's
gonna compare to the real thing.

43:06.050 --> 43:10.054
I've got no idea what he'll say.
I can't put us through this.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.957
It's the hardest decision
I've ever had to make.
