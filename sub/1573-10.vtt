00:13.331 --> 00:16.299
<b>6x10 - "The Lost One" </b>

00:23.258 --> 00:25.260
<i>A long-awaited truth!</i>

00:25.302 --> 00:28.221
<i>A distress signal has been
received at the Jedi Temple,</i>

00:28.263 --> 00:32.225
<i>and Master Plo Koon has been
dispatched to investigate its origin.</i>

00:32.267 --> 00:34.436
<i>The signal is from a ship
thought to be lost</i>

00:34.478 --> 00:36.188
<i>and was last known
to be in the possession</i>

00:36.229 --> 00:39.149
<i>of a Jedi Master
who was killed long ago.</i>

00:43.069 --> 00:44.446
Can anyone hear us?

00:44.488 --> 00:45.905
Come in, please.

00:45.947 --> 00:47.866
We're not getting anything over here.

00:47.907 --> 00:48.867
We're off.

00:48.908 --> 00:50.327
We must be way off.

00:50.369 --> 00:51.495
Negative.

00:51.537 --> 00:52.663
It is here.

00:52.704 --> 00:54.414
The data specifically states.

00:54.456 --> 00:56.082
It has got to be.

00:56.124 --> 00:58.084
We've scanned the area three times.

00:58.126 --> 01:00.837
This... this is a wasteland.
There's nothing.

01:03.089 --> 01:06.759
All of our information
pinpoints it is here.

01:06.801 --> 01:08.261
I don't know what to tell you, sir.

01:08.303 --> 01:09.513
We're getting no visual

01:09.555 --> 01:11.848
and no recognition on the scanner.

01:11.890 --> 01:14.601
We must locate the source
of the signal, Commander.

01:14.643 --> 01:16.061
Press on.

01:16.102 --> 01:17.187
Wait.

01:17.229 --> 01:18.771
I think I've found something.

01:18.813 --> 01:21.358
It's very faint, sir.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.026
That is it.

01:26.405 --> 01:28.281
Halt! Halt!

01:28.323 --> 01:30.158
Halt all vehicles!

01:58.895 --> 02:02.065
The hull shows
substantial scoring and wear.

02:02.107 --> 02:05.402
Whenever it crashed,
it wasn't recently.

02:05.444 --> 02:08.488
General Plo,
the scans check out.

02:08.530 --> 02:10.323
It's a T-6 shuttle, all right,

02:10.365 --> 02:13.326
serial number 775519.

02:24.170 --> 02:26.757
I want
the entire area cleared.

02:26.798 --> 02:29.593
We're taking everything
back to Coruscant.

02:29.635 --> 02:30.719
Everything?

02:30.761 --> 02:32.137
Everything!

02:44.899 --> 02:47.860
Then it is the lost ship
of Master Sifo-Dyas?

02:47.902 --> 02:50.989
I found this at the crash site.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.785
Hmm, the lightsaber of Sifo-Dyas it is.

02:54.825 --> 02:56.662
Never found when he died it was.

02:58.664 --> 03:00.248
Master Kenobi,
remind the Council

03:00.290 --> 03:02.709
of what you discovered
regarding Master Sifo-Dyas

03:02.751 --> 03:04.835
before the start
of the Clone War.

03:04.877 --> 03:07.631
My investigation
of the bounty hunter Jango Fett

03:07.673 --> 03:09.048
led to Kamino.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.383
The Kaminoans recounted

03:10.425 --> 03:12.385
that it was Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas

03:12.427 --> 03:15.054
who ordered the production
of a clone army.

03:15.096 --> 03:17.932
Without the consent
of the Council or the Senate

03:17.974 --> 03:19.184
he did this.

03:19.225 --> 03:20.893
Prior to the blockade
of Naboo,

03:20.935 --> 03:23.104
Sifo-Dyas sat on this Council

03:23.146 --> 03:27.150
until we judged his ideas
to be too extreme.

03:27.192 --> 03:30.945
Indeed, he said he foresaw
a great conflict

03:30.987 --> 03:33.573
and that the Republic
would need to raise an army.

03:33.615 --> 03:36.743
At the time, the Council
rejected those ideas.

03:36.785 --> 03:38.787
Well, it's not the first time

03:38.829 --> 03:40.539
we've been wrong recently, is it?

03:40.580 --> 03:43.041
The creation of the clone army,

03:43.082 --> 03:45.544
kept secret from us Sifo-Dyas did.

03:45.585 --> 03:48.463
How this was done we know not,

03:48.505 --> 03:51.383
yet now a new piece
of the puzzle we have.

03:51.424 --> 03:55.220
Perhaps clarity it will bring us, yes.

03:58.765 --> 04:01.184
Our records
definitively state

04:01.226 --> 04:05.230
that Master Sifo-Dyas
died on Felucia.

04:05.271 --> 04:08.316
In the fifth quarter,
a small skirmish broke out

04:08.358 --> 04:10.652
between the native Felucians.

04:10.694 --> 04:14.239
Master Sifo-Dyas was assigned
to negotiate peace talks

04:14.280 --> 04:16.408
between the tribes.

04:16.449 --> 04:21.120
The negotiations failed,
and Sifo-Dyas was killed.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.582
What became of his body?

04:23.623 --> 04:26.084
I'm afraid I cannot answer that.

04:26.125 --> 04:29.254
Any further information
on this incident

04:29.295 --> 04:31.005
has been sealed.

04:31.047 --> 04:32.758
On whose authority?

04:32.799 --> 04:35.886
By the office
of the Supreme Chancellor.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.555
Thank you, Madame Jacosta.

04:40.724 --> 04:44.603
To Felucia,
Skywalker and Kenobi will go.

04:44.644 --> 04:47.105
A trail long cold it is,

04:47.146 --> 04:49.858
yet still lay hidden there
a clue might be.

04:49.900 --> 04:51.359
Question all who were present

04:51.401 --> 04:54.112
the day of Sifo-Dyas' death,
you must.

04:54.153 --> 04:56.114
And what of the sealed file?

04:56.155 --> 04:58.575
Speak with the Chancellor
personally I will

04:58.617 --> 04:59.951
to see what part in this

04:59.992 --> 05:02.120
the politics of the Senate
have played.

05:09.335 --> 05:11.755
Master Sifo-Dyas?

05:11.797 --> 05:13.256
Forgive me.

05:13.298 --> 05:16.342
I'm afraid I am not familiar
with that name.

05:16.384 --> 05:19.471
Died some time ago he did
on Felucia.

05:19.512 --> 05:21.473
Investigating his death we are,

05:21.514 --> 05:24.142
and yet sealed
by the Chancellor's office

05:24.183 --> 05:25.811
some of his files were.

05:25.852 --> 05:29.147
And what is the nature
of your investigation?

05:29.188 --> 05:31.316
A Jedi matter it is, Chancellor.

05:31.357 --> 05:33.819
Add to your troubles I would not.

05:33.860 --> 05:36.571
That is very considerate,
Master Yoda.

05:36.613 --> 05:40.199
May I at least ask when Master...

05:40.241 --> 05:41.952
Sifo-Dyas.

05:41.992 --> 05:45.538
Yes, Master Sifo-Dyas,

05:45.580 --> 05:47.958
may I ask when he was killed?

05:47.998 --> 05:50.335
Over ten years ago it was.

05:50.376 --> 05:52.712
Well, that explains it.

05:52.754 --> 05:55.423
I'm afraid
this was before my time.

05:55.465 --> 05:58.176
Ten years ago,
I was a humble senator

05:58.217 --> 06:00.971
serving the planet Naboo.

06:01.011 --> 06:03.556
Only my predecessor,
Chancellor Valorum,

06:03.598 --> 06:06.184
would have the answers
you seek.

06:06.225 --> 06:08.854
I suggest you speak with him.

06:08.895 --> 06:10.062
Very well.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.857
Thank you, Chancellor.

06:20.657 --> 06:23.033
I have spoken with
the tribal leaders on Felucia.

06:23.075 --> 06:26.496
They use a very ancient dialect,
which is hard to understand,

06:26.538 --> 06:28.038
but from what I can make out,

06:28.080 --> 06:31.376
when Master Sifo-Dyas died,
he was not alone.

06:31.417 --> 06:33.712
There was a second Jedi
here with him.

06:33.753 --> 06:36.088
And the name
of this second Jedi?

06:36.130 --> 06:37.465
Either I don't
understand them,

06:37.507 --> 06:38.591
or they won't say.

06:38.633 --> 06:40.134
It's hard to tell.

06:40.176 --> 06:42.470
This is a primitive people
we are dealing with.

06:42.512 --> 06:45.348
After his death,
they cremated Sifo-Dyas' body,

06:45.390 --> 06:48.226
and I'm afraid
the trail goes cold there.

06:48.267 --> 06:50.436
Did you have any success
with the Chancellor?

06:50.478 --> 06:54.232
Hmm, as much success as usual,
I am afraid.

06:54.273 --> 06:56.526
Pointed in another direction I am now.

06:56.568 --> 06:58.778
To speak with Valorum I go.

07:11.583 --> 07:14.044
It's been a long time, my friend.

07:14.085 --> 07:15.837
What can I do for you?

07:15.879 --> 07:18.048
A file sealed
by your administration

07:18.089 --> 07:20.383
the Jedi Council has come across.

07:20.425 --> 07:22.928
The subject of the file?

07:22.969 --> 07:25.430
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.

07:25.471 --> 07:27.265
Sifo-Dyas?

07:27.306 --> 07:30.476
When I was Chancellor,
I sent him on a mission

07:30.518 --> 07:33.479
to deal with a flare-up
in the Pyke syndicate.

07:33.521 --> 07:35.023
The Pykes?

07:35.065 --> 07:37.943
A powerful part
of the spice cartel.

07:37.984 --> 07:40.278
Their criminal activities
had allowed them

07:40.319 --> 07:43.615
to almost completely control
the production of raw spice

07:43.656 --> 07:46.451
used to create a powerful drug.

07:46.492 --> 07:49.079
We were facing a full-scale war

07:49.120 --> 07:51.623
underneath the surface of Coruscant.

07:51.664 --> 07:53.875
Knowing of his expertise
on the Underworld,

07:53.917 --> 07:58.713
I contacted Master Sifo-Dyas
to stabilize the problem.

07:58.755 --> 08:01.967
Know of this, the Jedi Council did not.

08:02.008 --> 08:05.011
The Senate committee
assigned to the matter

08:05.053 --> 08:09.682
feared that open discussions
with such a criminal element

08:09.724 --> 08:11.893
could legitimize their activities

08:11.935 --> 08:15.647
and give strength to opposition leaders
within the bureaucracy.

08:15.688 --> 08:18.733
Secrecy was our only choice.

08:18.775 --> 08:23.113
The timing of these negotiations,
when were they to take place?

08:23.154 --> 08:26.908
I cannot remember
the precise timing, I'm afraid.

08:26.950 --> 08:28.534
It was so long ago.

08:28.576 --> 08:32.038
I do remember that the talks
were postponed

08:32.080 --> 08:35.833
not long after our delegates
arrived on Oba Diah,

08:35.875 --> 08:39.294
something about a flare-up
of activity on Felucia.

08:39.337 --> 08:41.089
Yes, intervene on Felucia,

08:41.131 --> 08:43.549
the Council insisted Sifo-Dyas did.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.010
But tell me, Chancellor.

08:45.051 --> 08:48.346
Who was the other Jedi
you sent with Sifo-Dyas?

08:48.387 --> 08:49.681
Other Jedi?

08:49.722 --> 08:52.017
I know of no other Jedi.

08:52.058 --> 08:56.562
There was only my personal
aide, Silman, and Sifo-Dyas.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.858
I'm afraid they were both
killed on Felucia.

08:59.899 --> 09:03.486
Personal aide, Silman?

09:07.073 --> 09:12.871
Tell me, why do the Jedi
look for Sifo-Dyas?

09:12.912 --> 09:15.289
What trail are they following?

09:15.331 --> 09:19.669
If there is a trail,
it is unknown to me.

09:19.711 --> 09:23.422
Retrace your steps, find this loose end,

09:23.464 --> 09:25.842
and eliminate it.

09:25.884 --> 09:28.845
I understand
what is at stake, my Lord.

09:28.887 --> 09:32.057
I will go to the Pykes
and take care of it.

09:32.098 --> 09:33.933
This is not the first time

09:33.975 --> 09:39.147
you have proven to be clumsy,
Lord Tyranus.

09:39.189 --> 09:42.859
You know
the price of failure.

09:50.783 --> 09:53.494
The Felucians
know nothing of this Silman.

09:53.536 --> 09:56.414
No one there seems to know
anything about him.

09:56.455 --> 09:58.457
What's that symbol he's wearing?

09:58.499 --> 09:59.792
The symbol
of the high Chancellor,

09:59.834 --> 10:03.337
before the war,
Chancellor Valorum.

10:03.379 --> 10:05.297
So we have one dead Jedi

10:05.339 --> 10:07.383
with no physical evidence of a body,

10:07.425 --> 10:09.260
a second Jedi
who appeared on Felucia

10:09.301 --> 10:10.720
that we have no record of,

10:10.762 --> 10:12.097
and now this Silman,

10:12.138 --> 10:14.099
personal attache to the Chancellor,

10:14.140 --> 10:15.850
is missing?

10:15.892 --> 10:18.310
Yet now we know
Sifo-Dyas and Silman

10:18.352 --> 10:21.313
were both on Oba Diah,
according to Chancellor Valorum.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.399
The crashed shuttle
I found

10:23.441 --> 10:26.819
was located on a moon
which orbits the Pyke planet.

10:26.861 --> 10:28.320
Hmm.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.991
To the Pykes you must go,
to Oba Diah, yes.

11:44.022 --> 11:49.819
I cannot remember
the last time a Jedi came here.

11:49.861 --> 11:52.404
Many years it has been.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.324
Funny you should say that.

11:54.364 --> 11:56.659
We're looking for a Jedi
that got lost here.

11:56.701 --> 11:58.870
His name is Sifo-Dyas.

11:58.911 --> 12:04.000
Oh, the Jedi Sifo-Dyas was here,

12:04.042 --> 12:08.754
but that was a long time ago.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.257
Master Sifo-Dyas' ship was found,

12:11.299 --> 12:13.551
crashed on a moon
orbiting this world.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.845
What you found,

12:15.887 --> 12:19.015
we know nothing of.

12:19.057 --> 12:24.979
Would the Jedi like to join us
for a refreshment?

12:25.021 --> 12:27.523
The Pykes' offer is kindly accepted.

12:34.322 --> 12:36.448
To friendship.

12:38.576 --> 12:41.579
Friendship.
Friendship.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.877
What an interesting necklace that is.

12:47.919 --> 12:49.295
May I have a look?

12:51.047 --> 12:55.218
Perhaps the Pykes have taken
enough of the Jedi's time.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.469
Oh, no, no.
It's no bother at all.

12:57.511 --> 13:00.514
The Jedi are happy to know
all the Pykes' secrets.

13:03.351 --> 13:06.562
We have no quarrel with the Jedi.

13:06.604 --> 13:08.398
Maybe you should tell us
why you're wearing

13:08.438 --> 13:11.276
the crest of the Chancellor's
personal advisor.

13:11.317 --> 13:14.779
I am confused.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.323
Is the Jedi looking for a Jedi Master

13:17.365 --> 13:19.700
or someone else?

13:19.742 --> 13:21.327
Stop playing games.

13:21.369 --> 13:23.579
Sifo-Dyas was traveling
with an advisor.

13:23.621 --> 13:26.456
They were sent here
to negotiate with you.

13:28.751 --> 13:33.631
Well, it looks like you have
finally put the pieces together.

13:33.672 --> 13:37.509
The man you are looking for is here.

13:47.770 --> 13:50.731
The Pykes wanted
to gain an advantage

13:50.773 --> 13:53.734
over the other crime families,

13:53.776 --> 13:56.154
so alliances were made.

13:56.195 --> 13:59.740
One alliance was with a man
named Tyranus.

13:59.782 --> 14:01.409
I've heard that name before.

14:01.451 --> 14:04.829
Jango Fett mentioned it
during my Kamino investigation.

14:04.870 --> 14:08.458
Tyranus wanted Sifo-Dyas dead.

14:08.498 --> 14:12.878
The Pykes were well paid
to shoot down his ship.

14:12.920 --> 14:18.217
However, any man that is willing
to pay to have a Jedi killed

14:18.259 --> 14:21.262
is dangerous and unpredictable.

14:21.304 --> 14:23.722
The Pykes inspected the crash

14:23.764 --> 14:27.726
to retrieve the Jedi's body for proof.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.855
But with the dead Jedi,

14:30.896 --> 14:34.859
the Pykes found another, still alive.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.153
Silman,
the Chancellor's aide?

14:37.195 --> 14:40.739
The Pykes gave Tyranus Sifo-Dyas,

14:40.781 --> 14:44.660
but the Pykes did not
tell Tyranus of Silman.

14:44.702 --> 14:49.123
The Pykes needed insurance.

14:49.165 --> 14:50.416
Insurance?

14:50.458 --> 14:55.754
Yes, and now the Pykes can bargain.

14:55.796 --> 14:57.589
We give you Silman.

14:57.631 --> 15:02.512
You forget about the Pykes'
treachery against the Jedi.

15:18.152 --> 15:19.820
Hello?

15:19.862 --> 15:21.989
Who... who's there?

15:22.031 --> 15:24.867
We are Jedi sent to find you.

15:24.909 --> 15:27.619
Jedi?

15:27.661 --> 15:30.664
To find me?
Why me?

15:30.706 --> 15:34.001
I was betrayed,
forgotten...

15:34.043 --> 15:36.003
long ago.

15:36.045 --> 15:38.172
No one knew you were alive.

15:38.214 --> 15:39.173
Quick.

15:39.215 --> 15:40.966
Maybe you have some food.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.469
Have you... have you any food?

15:43.511 --> 15:45.804
Of course.

15:46.805 --> 15:48.099
Oh, oh!

15:48.140 --> 15:49.141
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh!

15:49.183 --> 15:50.684
Thank you, my friend.

15:50.726 --> 15:52.019
A supply bar!

15:52.061 --> 15:54.855
Mmm, mmm.
Delicious.

15:54.897 --> 15:59.235
You see, I was so frightened
I would have nothing to serve.

16:00.236 --> 16:01.195
Oh, oh, oh!
Oh, oh!

16:01.237 --> 16:02.447
Serve?

16:02.488 --> 16:05.241
My... my babies, they get so angry

16:05.283 --> 16:07.452
when I have nothing
to serve.

16:07.493 --> 16:10.580
We might have a problem here.

16:26.762 --> 16:29.974
Tyranus, you are
no longer welcome here.

16:33.644 --> 16:36.730
I think you've been cooped up
in here too long, old man.

16:36.772 --> 16:38.774
We've come to take you home.

16:38.816 --> 16:40.692
Home?

16:40.734 --> 16:42.987
No, no, this is my home.

16:43.028 --> 16:44.989
I can't leave my friends.

16:45.030 --> 16:47.825
You were traveling
with Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas.

16:47.866 --> 16:49.619
Tell us what happened to him.

16:52.037 --> 16:53.914
Sifo-Dyas?

16:53.956 --> 16:54.957
He died.

16:54.999 --> 16:57.042
Died, died, died, died.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.919
Tricked, we were.

16:58.961 --> 17:01.088
The Pykes are not
to be trusted.

17:01.130 --> 17:02.298
Oh, no, no, no, no.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.090
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.801
But the Pykes were not the ones.

17:06.844 --> 17:10.097
No, no, the Pykes
were not the reason.

17:13.724 --> 17:15.560
Who was responsible?

17:18.396 --> 17:20.983
Someone powerful,

17:21.025 --> 17:26.030
someone who... who wanted
to be Sifo-Dyas.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.085
Why?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.295
All is deception.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.131
Can't you see?

17:44.173 --> 17:46.384
Because... because...

18:00.981 --> 18:02.650
Dooku.

18:02.692 --> 18:05.486
For once, you actually came
to do your own dirty work.

18:06.945 --> 18:11.033
Sometimes things
are just that important.

18:32.430 --> 18:33.431
Ah!

19:00.999 --> 19:05.504
You have no business left
with the Pykes, Tyranus.

19:05.546 --> 19:06.631
Tyranus?

19:06.672 --> 19:08.674
You are the man called Tyranus?

19:08.716 --> 19:11.802
I told you everything
you needed to know on Geonosis

19:11.843 --> 19:15.013
all those years ago, Kenobi.

19:15.055 --> 19:17.224
You should have joined me.

19:17.266 --> 19:18.892
Sifo-Dyas understood.

19:18.934 --> 19:20.978
He saw the future.

19:21.019 --> 19:23.021
That is why he helped me.

19:23.063 --> 19:24.732
You lie.

19:24.774 --> 19:26.066
Minister Lom,

19:26.108 --> 19:28.611
if you are going to help us,
now is the time.

19:28.653 --> 19:30.195
Kill Tyranus!

20:09.193 --> 20:11.320
I'll give you a push.

20:49.608 --> 20:53.404
Know now we do
that guide the creation of the clones

20:53.445 --> 20:55.614
from the beginning, Dooku did.

20:55.656 --> 21:00.160
Hmm, our enemy
created an army for us.

21:00.202 --> 21:01.829
If this was known,

21:01.871 --> 21:03.955
public confidence
in the war effort,

21:03.997 --> 21:06.291
the Jedi, and the Republic
would vanish.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.502
There would be mass chaos.

21:08.544 --> 21:11.881
Cover up this discovery we must.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.257
No one,

21:13.298 --> 21:16.802
not even the Chancellor, may know.

21:16.844 --> 21:19.930
Valiant men
the clones have proven to be.

21:19.971 --> 21:23.434
Saved my life and yours
they have many times.

21:23.475 --> 21:26.186
Believe in them we must.

21:26.228 --> 21:29.481
Win the war swiftly we must,

21:29.523 --> 21:32.484
before our enemy's designs
reach completion,

21:32.526 --> 21:34.528
whatever they may be.

21:34.570 --> 21:38.490
Are you sure we are taking
the right path?

21:38.532 --> 21:41.034
Hmm, the right path,

21:41.076 --> 21:42.411
no.

21:42.453 --> 21:44.455
The only path,

21:44.496 --> 21:46.874
yes.

21:46.916 --> 21:49.084
Designed by the Dark Lord
of the Sith,

21:49.126 --> 21:52.254
this web is.

21:52.296 --> 21:55.966
For now, play his game we must.
