original comedy.

00:04.938 --> 00:06.307
- Yeah, I really liked her.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.842
She gave me a great haircut.
Not that Andy will notice.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.478
He never notices that shit.
- Listen, I have to

00:10.511 --> 00:12.012
give you a heads-up on one thing
before you come--

00:12.046 --> 00:13.381
- Listen, I'm just arriving
home right now,

00:13.414 --> 00:15.783
so can I call you later?

00:15.816 --> 00:17.785
When am I seeing you?

00:17.818 --> 00:20.188
Oh, I guess right now.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.123
- I'm so sorry for
what's about to happen.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.125
- Why?

00:24.158 --> 00:26.660
Hi.
- Jill.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.696
We need to talk to you.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.898
- Worst words in
the English language.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.667
- * Hey, yes, you know

00:33.701 --> 00:38.639
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

00:38.672 --> 00:40.508
- Jill, everyone here
loves you.

00:40.541 --> 00:43.411
But we need to speak with you
about something difficult.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.180
- [laughs] Oh, my God.
Is this an intervention?

00:46.214 --> 00:49.217
- Sort of.
- I am not an alkie.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.918
I just had three glasses
of pinot noir

00:50.951 --> 00:53.154
at breakfast last week
because the sitter canceled.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.922
- Jill, honey, we don't think
you're an alcoholic.

00:54.955 --> 00:56.357
- Though now
I'm a little worried.

00:56.390 --> 00:59.026
- Oh, please,
alcoholism was invented

00:59.059 --> 01:01.495
in the 1980s
to sell magazines,

01:01.529 --> 01:04.232
along with parenting
and happiness.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.568
- Jill, you need to learn
how to drive.

01:07.601 --> 01:10.138
- What?
I'm a New Yorker.

01:10.138 --> 01:11.605
"You don't have to drive."

01:11.639 --> 01:13.407
It's like printed
on our license plates.

01:13.441 --> 01:17.145
- A true shedonist wouldn't let
a man drive her,

01:17.145 --> 01:20.148
unless she was wealthy enough
to hire a man to drive for her,

01:20.148 --> 01:22.616
which is the very pinnacle
of shedonism.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.818
- Feminism.
And Gloria Steinem

01:24.852 --> 01:26.354
doesn't even know
how to drive.

01:26.387 --> 01:27.988
- Jill, watch you language.
There are children

01:28.021 --> 01:29.957
in the next room.
- See, the difference

01:29.990 --> 01:32.593
between shedonism and the whole
Gloria Steinem thing

01:32.626 --> 01:35.196
is that shedonism isn't angry
or man hating.

01:35.229 --> 01:38.332
- Stop talking.
I am here for Jill.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.967
- This is ridiculous, okay?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.702
When has my
not knowing how to drive

01:41.735 --> 01:44.638
ever been a problem for you?

01:44.672 --> 01:46.707
Honey, why don't I
take the kids to the beach?

01:46.740 --> 01:49.510
And you can sleep all day
after you drive us there.

01:49.543 --> 01:52.313
Or you could just sleep
in the car in the parking lot

01:52.346 --> 01:54.782
so you can
drive us home after.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.185
Anyone want to go
for ice cream?

01:57.218 --> 02:01.855
Can I take one of your drivers
for ice cream?

02:01.889 --> 02:03.090
Et tu, Brutus?

02:03.191 --> 02:06.194
- Honey, I know it hurts,
but yes.

02:06.194 --> 02:09.363
- Scenic route!
Scenic route!

02:09.397 --> 02:11.699
Guys, I'm sorry if my
not knowing how to drive

02:11.732 --> 02:14.202
is annoying, but it's too late
for me to learn.

02:14.235 --> 02:15.869
That ship has sailed.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.038
- Jill, this is a safety issue
for you and the kids.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.307
I'm putting my foot down.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.941
- You know what
your problem is?

02:20.974 --> 02:22.743
You're not working,
so you're sitting around

02:22.776 --> 02:24.745
all day,
coming up with problems.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.314
You've got
Betty Draper syndrome.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.449
- I am not Betty Draper.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.884
- Well, I'm not getting in a car
with some creepy stranger

02:30.918 --> 02:32.920
who's gonna teach me
how to drive.

02:32.953 --> 02:36.123
- Fine, you don't want
a creepy stranger?

02:36.224 --> 02:38.226
Okay, first thing's first.

02:38.226 --> 02:42.062
You want to think of
the steering wheel as a clock.

02:42.095 --> 02:46.300
Your starting position
is ten and two.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.735
- Okay,
I changed my mind.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.703
I do want a creepy stranger
to teach me.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.004
- Why?

02:51.038 --> 02:53.574
- Because it's better
if I hate a stranger.

to receive an invitation

03:03.684 --> 03:05.253

I don't want him there.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.989
You know why.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.758

Yes.

03:26.307 --> 03:27.775
But it's been six months.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.510
You're sending
the wrong message.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.579
- The wrong message to whom?
- Well there's a way

03:31.612 --> 03:33.414
that these things
are done in society,

03:33.447 --> 03:37.285
which you might not know about
because you're from Connecticut.

for a one-time indiscretion.

A four- or five-month separation
for a sustained affair.

03:43.957 --> 03:46.960

people will think that he got

03:46.994 --> 03:48.762

or something

09:16.356 --> 09:19.359
vague resemblance to Robb Stark
from "Game of Thrones."

09:19.392 --> 09:21.795
- You're whacking it
to your driving instructor.

09:21.829 --> 09:24.965
- First of all, I am too tired
to whack it to anyone.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.934
And second, I've been married
for 12 years.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.969
I'm entitled
to a harmless crush.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.639
Trust me,
he would never be into me.

09:31.672 --> 09:34.441
- Um, I think that's
besides the point, right?

09:34.474 --> 09:36.810
- Yes, and you know I would
never cheat on Andy.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.012
Ever.
It's just, Nico is like

09:39.046 --> 09:42.650
that bad boy rocker type
I never banged.

09:42.650 --> 09:44.151
Why didn't I do that?

09:44.184 --> 09:46.787
- Because deep down
in the core of your being

09:46.820 --> 09:49.156
you prefer the smell
of a pampered man.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.124
- God damn it, I do!

09:51.158 --> 09:53.326
Ugh, my B.O. sensitivity
has kept me

09:53.360 --> 09:55.796
from experiencing so much.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.331
But Nico is 100% B.O.-free.

09:58.365 --> 10:01.168
- Okay then.
Go crazy.

10:01.201 --> 10:03.003
Throw it all away.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.172
Run off with your
driving teacher.

10:05.205 --> 10:08.075
- Hey, this is what you get
for ganging up on me

10:08.108 --> 10:09.877
about not knowing
how to drive.

10:09.910 --> 10:11.679
Home wrecker.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.515
- As I've explained already,

10:15.548 --> 10:18.551
the other option
is to invite Lex

10:18.585 --> 10:20.988
but not do any pictures
with him.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.190
That is a move
popularized by all

10:23.223 --> 10:25.158
of Harvey Weinstein's ex-wives.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.328
- But we're not divorced.
I don't want to look cold.

10:28.361 --> 10:32.199
- So you do one photo
with him and the children.

10:32.232 --> 10:35.703
It says,
"We are co-parenting, but--"

10:35.736 --> 10:37.270
- The children
won't be there.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.172
Children remind people
of responsibility,

10:39.206 --> 10:40.941
and that's not what
we're selling.

10:40.974 --> 10:44.544
- Okay, how about this?
It's a classic.

10:44.577 --> 10:48.248
Invite him to the party
but not the after party.

10:48.281 --> 10:51.685
It's clean, it says,
"We're on speaking terms,

10:51.719 --> 10:53.721
but we're not
actually speaking."

10:53.754 --> 10:55.555
- Mm, or does it say

10:55.588 --> 10:57.891
I didn't want to invite him,
but I need him.

10:57.925 --> 11:01.929
Because neediness
is completely off brand.

11:01.962 --> 11:05.098
Ugh!
Why doesn't anything feel right?

11:05.132 --> 11:07.534
- [sighs] Oh, dear.

11:07.567 --> 11:10.804
[upbeat rock music]

11:10.838 --> 11:13.340
- Honestly, what more
does she want from you?

11:13.373 --> 11:15.843
Roses, jewelry.

11:15.876 --> 11:18.645
$15 million worth
of start-up financing.

11:18.746 --> 11:20.380
- It takes a lot of roses
to fix a heart

11:20.413 --> 11:22.950
that's been A-bombed, Mom.

11:22.983 --> 11:24.517
That's what I did.

11:24.551 --> 11:26.653
I A-bombed her heart.

11:26.754 --> 11:29.289
[laughs]
Stop, it tickles.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.492
- Alexander,
women are like horses.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.328
If you're kind to them,
they will buck you off

11:35.362 --> 11:36.897
and trample you to death.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.366
Now, you've got to show Brooke
who's in charge.

11:39.399 --> 11:41.034
And stop being so desperate.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.069
[knock at door]

11:42.102 --> 11:43.871
- It's Patty.

11:43.904 --> 11:46.306
Excuse me, but Mrs. Von-Weber
just sent over

11:46.339 --> 11:49.376
an invitation to her opening.
- Booyah, Mom!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.812
- She's also sent instructions
on how to enter

11:51.845 --> 11:53.981
through the staff tent,
a list of people

11:54.014 --> 11:56.149
you're allowed to speak to,
and talking points

11:56.183 --> 11:58.819
for those conversations.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.789
- Brooke isn't on the list
of people I can talk to?

12:01.789 --> 12:04.257
- [neighs]

12:04.291 --> 12:07.027
Sounds like
someone's being bucked.

12:08.128 --> 12:12.800
*

12:12.800 --> 12:15.468
- You know, back in my country,
I was a doctor.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.938
- Seriously?
- No, I was a driving teacher.

12:17.971 --> 12:20.007
- [laughs]
- I could never be a doctor.

12:20.040 --> 12:22.109
Sick people, needles, ick.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.477
- So I'm guessing these are all
temporary tattoos.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.179
- [laughs]
No, but I was terrified

12:26.213 --> 12:28.481
when I got my first one.
- Well I've been fantasizing

12:28.515 --> 12:30.183
about getting
a tasteful little skull

12:30.217 --> 12:32.452
right on my shoulder.
- Okay, now we're talking.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.087
How about after you pass
your driving test

12:34.121 --> 12:36.023
we celebrate with some
new ink?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.125
- Do you do that
with all your students?

12:38.158 --> 12:39.626
You're gonna run out of skin.

12:39.659 --> 12:42.830
- Most of my students
need parental consent.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.033
In your case I guess
it'd be husband consent?

12:46.066 --> 12:49.469
- [sighs] No, Andy would
dismember me if I got another.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.104
I'd be fish food.
- Okay.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.306
Then scratch that.

12:53.340 --> 12:54.641
- Actually,
what am I saying?

12:54.674 --> 12:56.476
Andy's not my dad.

12:56.509 --> 12:57.544
I'm in.

12:57.577 --> 13:00.513
*

13:12.893 --> 13:14.862
[screams]

13:20.333 --> 13:21.168
- It's not that late.
- It's been hours

13:23.070 --> 13:24.137
since you two left.
- I'm sorry.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.906
I just spilled coffee
on Nico,

13:25.939 --> 13:27.407
so I wanted to get him
another one.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.943
- You had coffee
with your driving instructor?

13:29.977 --> 13:31.879
- Yeah, what's the big deal?

13:31.912 --> 13:33.981
I found out that
his band needs a photographer

13:34.014 --> 13:35.548
for their website
and they might hire me.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.285
- Oh, well that's convenient
for everyone.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.387
- Are you jealous?
You never get jealous.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.055
- What do you expect?
The guy looks like

13:42.089 --> 13:45.258
Colin Farrell.
- No, he doesn't.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.494
He's way hotter.
- [sighs]

13:47.527 --> 13:49.396
- Sorry, that's not
a useful point right now.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.931
- You obviously have
a crush on him.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.632
- No, I don't.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.167
And you have crushes
all the time.

13:54.201 --> 13:56.503
What about that florist
from our wedding?

13:56.536 --> 13:58.906
- Well that was different.
She was very knowledgeable

13:58.906 --> 14:00.607
about horticulture.

14:00.640 --> 14:02.642
Oh, you know what?
I changed my mind.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.977
You don't need
to learn to drive.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.712
- What?
No, no, no, no, no.

14:05.745 --> 14:09.049
I am getting my license
and you can't stop me.

14:09.082 --> 14:11.051
Plus, I like driving now.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.619

It's like you've been

14:18.258 --> 14:19.692
driving your whole life.

14:19.726 --> 14:21.194
I'm so proud of you.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.931
- Thank you.
I love driving!

14:23.964 --> 14:26.433
And I love being able
to blare my music.

a lobster's eyes as he died.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.772
- That's a lot of mollusks.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.341
- It was
a full-on Molocaust.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.343

really remember, but, um,

I think the clinical term
is traumatic memory loss,

15:25.692 --> 15:27.460
right, Vaness?
- Mm-hmm, sure.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.397
- Why didn't "Nico"
just use his brake?

15:30.430 --> 15:32.232
- Um, honey, first of all,
you don't need

15:32.265 --> 15:35.402
to do finger quotes,
'cause that's actually his name.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.905
And secondly, we were talking
and it happened really fast.

15:39.006 --> 15:41.708
- Ah, uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

15:41.741 --> 15:44.077
Well I guess
after the test tomorrow,

15:44.111 --> 15:47.647
no more Nico.

no more Nico.

There's no way.

19:00.507 --> 19:04.977
- Oh, they're my weakness.
Toodleoo.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.015
[no audible dialogue]

19:09.048 --> 19:11.218
Jeez.
[laughs]

19:11.218 --> 19:13.220
- See you Wednesday.
- You got it.

19:15.054 --> 19:16.989
- This was a setup!

19:17.023 --> 19:19.226
It--it's a bribe!
You're in cahoots?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.627
- Shh, what are you
talking about?

19:20.660 --> 19:23.029
You passed with flying colors,
A-plus!

19:23.062 --> 19:25.965
- You can't let me drive.
I'm a menace to society,

19:25.998 --> 19:28.535
and shellfish, and probably
a lot of other things.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.969
- Sweetheart, relax,
just get back in the--

19:30.002 --> 19:31.371
- Don't call me sweetheart.

19:31.404 --> 19:32.972
[in Australian accent]
You're a fake and a phony

19:33.005 --> 19:36.309
and I wish I'd never
laid eyes on you!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.345
- Whatever.
- [normal voice] And to think

19:38.378 --> 19:40.547
I almost got
a tasteful skull with you.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.014
[engine turns over]
I hope you enjoy

19:42.048 --> 19:44.150
your delicious
fried doughnut balls!

19:44.251 --> 19:47.420
I hope they fill the hole where
your integrity used to be!

19:47.454 --> 19:50.723
Australia is colonized
by criminals!

19:50.757 --> 19:53.726
[somber music]

19:53.760 --> 19:55.428
[cheering on TV]
[buzzer]

19:55.462 --> 19:57.497
[phone vibrates]

19:57.530 --> 19:58.865
- Hey, hon,
how'd it go?

19:58.898 --> 20:01.033
- You're a good man.
I love you

20:01.067 --> 20:03.069
and I'm so glad
I'm married to you.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.072
- Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
That's okay.

20:06.105 --> 20:08.107
A lot of people fail
their first time.

20:08.140 --> 20:11.411
- No, I passed, but I am never
going to drive.

20:11.444 --> 20:13.380
Everything is a hoax.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.382
- [laughs] Well I don't know
what you're talking about,

20:15.415 --> 20:17.584
sweetie, but I love you too.

20:17.617 --> 20:21.621
- Can you come pick me up
in Coney Island?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.155
- What?

20:33.500 --> 20:35.134
- Hi, there.
- Oh, hello.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.636
- Hi, can I help you
with something?

20:36.669 --> 20:38.137
- Uh, yes, please, could you
tell me how much

20:38.170 --> 20:39.539
this suede bag is?

20:39.572 --> 20:43.610
- Oh, this one is $2,900.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.745
- Oh, jeez,
that's pretty pricey.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.714
- Mm-hmm.
- How is it for stains?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.282
Good?
- Good.

20:49.316 --> 20:51.217
- My gosh,
I like the white one, too,

20:51.250 --> 20:53.453
'cause sometimes I wear
white jeans, you know?

20:53.486 --> 20:55.922
But I wear a lot of denim,
so I like the blue.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.924
I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get both of them.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.059
- Oh, oh, all right.
- Cash all right?

21:00.092 --> 21:01.661
- Sure.

21:07.334 --> 21:08.901
- Oh.
There you go.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.338
And a little something extra
for you, Felipe.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.373
- Oh, you--that's not my name.
- Tell you what,

21:13.406 --> 21:16.743
I don't need a bag,
it'll just weigh me down.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.512
All right.
You have a good day.

21:19.546 --> 21:23.350
- Have a--have a good day.

21:23.350 --> 21:26.353
- For more "Odd Mom Out,"
go to Bravotv.com.

21:26.386 --> 21:28.355
[seagull squawking]
- Oh, dear.

21:30.357 --> 21:31.958
- Left, right, left, right,
left, right!
