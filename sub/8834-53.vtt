It's my turn!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.792

Hey, guys,
we're supposed to be the jungle aces.

01:12.667 --> 01:13.834

01:14.000 --> 01:17.500
I kinda like the ring

But, Ernie, Bullethead's just
a comic book hero.

Oh, yeah? Name one pilot who can do

01:27.917 --> 01:28.917

a Baloo belly flop.

Hey, what's going on?

01:48.709 --> 01:51.792
You're just as brave and tough

Gee. It looks like
I let Kit down.

He's really neat-looking.

02:46.333 --> 02:50.333
Mel dusts, vacuums,
and even washes windows.

02:54.542 --> 02:58.375
That paperweight was worth $3,000.

03:00.709 --> 03:03.542

Can you help me out, Buzz?

03:37.375 --> 03:42.000
[Buzz] Sure. I know what it's like,
my father let me me down when I was a kid.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.375
I'm not going to let Kit down.

What's this?

04:08.333 --> 04:11.750

04:12.667 --> 04:14.500
Only part that survived the wreck.

Nope, nope, nope.

04:18.709 --> 04:20.041
Nothing in here, either.

04:41.041 --> 04:43.291
Hey, how about this rocket pack?

04:43.709 --> 04:45.750
Kit's going to love this.

04:45.917 --> 04:47.417
Ok. Here's the plan.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.583
Be at the malt shop at 2:00.

04:50.667 --> 04:53.166
You'll need a convincing costume...

04:53.458 --> 04:55.250

12:38.500 --> 12:40.208
I got to see Khan right away.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.625
One moment, please.

12:43.500 --> 12:46.583
Mr. Khan, that Bullethead nut is here.

12:49.417 --> 12:50.458
Eject him,

12:50.625 --> 12:55.250
and I don't want to be disturbed
again by anyone.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.542
What would Bullethead do?

13:09.250 --> 13:11.750
Skyward ho!

13:33.625 --> 13:34.792
[crash]

13:40.083 --> 13:43.125
You've embarrassed me once today.

13:43.208 --> 13:45.375
I think that's quite enough.

13:52.625 --> 13:57.667
Oh. I wonder if Bullethead
ever gets stuck on ledges.

14:04.542 --> 14:06.500
He's probably stuck there

14:06.583 --> 14:07.875
like a cat in a tree.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.333
Let's get him.

14:09.834 --> 14:11.417
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah!

14:12.166 --> 14:13.417
What will you do?

14:13.792 --> 14:15.291
Repossess his gear.

14:15.500 --> 14:19.291
We deserve that rocket pack
more than he does.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.917
[engine revving]

14:30.500 --> 14:31.333
Halt!

14:34.750 --> 14:35.750
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

14:35.834 --> 14:37.375
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

14:37.458 --> 14:39.250
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

14:39.333 --> 14:43.625
You're beginning to try
my patience, Baloo.

14:43.709 --> 14:45.000
<i>Kidnap khan.</i>

14:45.083 --> 14:46.834
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

14:46.917 --> 14:48.333
I said halt.

14:48.333 --> 14:50.333
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

14:50.750 --> 14:52.500
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

14:52.583 --> 14:53.750
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

14:53.834 --> 14:55.959
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

14:56.041 --> 14:58.083
I don't like this idea.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.041
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

15:00.333 --> 15:02.333
Whoop. Aah!

15:08.875 --> 15:12.208
Buzz has got to get the bugs out.

15:18.834 --> 15:20.041
Solid.

15:20.125 --> 15:21.375
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

15:38.000 --> 15:39.583
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

15:43.333 --> 15:46.125
Now what would
Bullethead do?

15:46.208 --> 15:49.041
The Bullethead
dynamo plunge, huh?

15:49.125 --> 15:52.041
That shouldn't be too tough
for a flying ace like me.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.875
Come on and get me!

16:13.250 --> 16:14.417
[all gulp] Uh-oh.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.750
Skyward ho!

16:26.375 --> 16:29.792
Now turn around and leave.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.083
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

16:39.166 --> 16:40.542
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

16:40.667 --> 16:41.709
<i>Kidnap Khan.</i>

16:41.834 --> 16:44.542
I am not amused.

16:44.792 --> 16:45.917
I'm not, either.

16:46.041 --> 16:49.625
That's the cheesiest
robot suit I've ever seen.

16:50.458 --> 16:51.792
<i>Get Bullethead.</i>

16:52.041 --> 16:53.208
You just try.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.417
Hey!

16:54.500 --> 16:56.834
I am still not amused.

16:57.417 --> 16:58.625
Hey!

17:11.666 --> 17:14.416
Baloo! Baloo, speak to me.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.791
I'm blind! I'm blind!

17:18.916 --> 17:21.083
Papa bear, you're OK.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.000
Yeah, but I'm not cut out

17:23.083 --> 17:25.000
for this hero stuff.

17:25.416 --> 17:28.541
That robot took Khan and Ernie.
Help us.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.250
This time I'm going to the police.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.500
I want to report a kidnapping.

17:35.917 --> 17:37.417
I know you.

17:37.709 --> 17:40.291
The loony with the crazy costume.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.583
Say, where's your rocket pack?

17:42.750 --> 17:44.125
This is serious.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.875
Khan's been kidnapped by a robot.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.083
You already tried that one.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.750
[ring]

17:52.166 --> 17:53.750
Police headquarters.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.417
So you got Shere Khan.

17:56.625 --> 17:59.917
Hold on a second.
It's for you.

18:01.333 --> 18:02.333
Hello?

18:03.291 --> 18:05.375
It's him. You got to do something.

18:05.458 --> 18:08.792
What do you want?
You're the superhero.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.667
This is, uh, officer Krupkie.

18:11.750 --> 18:13.834
Take anything you want.

18:13.917 --> 18:16.291
Tell us where Khan is.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.542
Finally, someone who
will take me seriously.

18:19.834 --> 18:21.792
First, I want to go on the radio

18:21.917 --> 18:23.917
and tell everyone I'm a genius.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.166
Radio, huh

18:25.417 --> 18:30.959
If you're going to be famous,
you need a chauffeured-driven limo.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.375
Famous people got them.

18:32.542 --> 18:34.166
Really? Throw that in, too.

18:34.500 --> 18:37.291
Give me directions to your place.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.250
I'll send the limo right over.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.583
After I get them
in the <i>Sea Duck...</i>

18:43.834 --> 18:45.583
We'll free the hostages.

18:49.291 --> 18:51.041
[Axelottel] Today, radio!

18:51.291 --> 18:53.041
Tomorrow, the movies!

18:53.208 --> 18:54.250
The day after that--

18:54.333 --> 18:55.250
[knock on door]

18:56.208 --> 18:57.834
Dr. Axelottel, I presume.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.792
I'm your new chauffeur.

19:00.083 --> 19:03.834
Hurry, You go on the radio
in 30 minutes.

19:04.250 --> 19:06.959
Wait. Mel has to watch the hostages.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.500
You need him.

19:08.750 --> 19:11.208
Every radio show needs a cohost.

19:11.542 --> 19:14.583
I better leave him.
Stay, Mel, stay.

19:16.625 --> 19:17.625
Darn.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.417
He left the robot here, I'll have to get
the robot to come after me.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.583
Good luck, Pap Bear.

19:34.291 --> 19:36.417
Why don't you reach over

19:36.500 --> 19:38.083
and grab us some sodas?

19:38.458 --> 19:40.208
Hey, wait a minute.

19:40.792 --> 19:42.333
You're Bullethead.

19:42.417 --> 19:44.250
Aw, shucks. Guess I am.

19:44.709 --> 19:45.709
Mel.

19:45.792 --> 19:46.792
Mel!

19:47.208 --> 19:48.166
Mel!

19:52.250 --> 19:53.291
<i>Use door.</i>

19:53.458 --> 19:54.458
<i>Use door.</i>

20:00.792 --> 20:02.667
We got you free!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.333
Well done, children,

20:05.417 --> 20:07.291
but whom do I thank?

20:07.375 --> 20:10.417
You can thank the jungle aces.

20:10.500 --> 20:11.667
Yeah!

20:15.041 --> 20:16.959
<i>Destroy, destroy.</i>

20:17.166 --> 20:18.291
[crash]

20:18.375 --> 20:20.375
<i>Destroy, destroy.</i>

20:23.500 --> 20:25.417
I wanted Mel to dust,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.333
but they said I was mad.

20:27.667 --> 20:29.875
Why would they say that?

20:36.083 --> 20:38.208
<i>Destroy, destroy.</i>

20:48.500 --> 20:50.417
<i>Destroy, destroy.</i>

20:50.500 --> 20:52.917

20:53.000 --> 20:55.250
Uh-oh. I think he's mad.

21:26.125 --> 21:28.000
[dings]

21:31.959 --> 21:34.917
Hey, just you and me now, Doc.

21:35.166 --> 21:38.333
Wrong!
You shouldn't leave this lying around.

21:38.417 --> 21:40.041
I wouldn't do that if i were you.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.959
It's got a few bugs.

21:55.291 --> 21:59.917
Say, Buzz, tell Khan the jungle aces
love their gifts.

22:00.208 --> 22:02.417
Why did they want those?

22:02.500 --> 22:05.041
You can't master a dynamo plunge

22:05.125 --> 22:08.417
till you master falling
from a hammock. Right?

22:09.000 --> 22:10.208
-Right, Baloo!
-Right, Baloo!

22:14.500 --> 22:17.834
Nobody falls out
of a hammock like you, Papa Bear.
