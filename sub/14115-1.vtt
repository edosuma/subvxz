00:51.708 --> 00:54.040
ZATOICHI

01:58.083 --> 01:59.664
Kid...

01:59.750 --> 02:03.163
Bring us that blind masseur's cane.

02:03.250 --> 02:05.707
We'll pay you if you succeed.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.614
Be careful.
Do it quietly, so he won't hear.

02:27.167 --> 02:28.907
Thanks.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.999
Scram!

02:33.375 --> 02:34.990
Beat it, brat!

02:40.167 --> 02:41.282
Ichi!

02:50.000 --> 02:54.915
Even you, fooled by an innocent child!

02:56.000 --> 03:00.539
Even a master is powerless
without his sword.

04:46.417 --> 04:48.749
REST STOP

04:53.875 --> 04:56.537
Drink up!

04:59.208 --> 05:00.869
What are you doing?

05:00.958 --> 05:05.281
You were the Naruto family's clerk.
Don't you recognise us?

05:06.875 --> 05:10.697
- The Naruto family?
- I'm the daughter!

05:39.292 --> 05:43.114
What now?
We already paid this month!

05:43.208 --> 05:46.041
You didn't pay today!

05:46.125 --> 05:50.619
Now you have to pay
each time we come by.

05:51.625 --> 05:56.574
- We'll have nothing to live on.
- Stop complaining! Shut up and pay.

05:56.667 --> 05:59.989
Things weren't this bad
with the Funahachi gang.

06:00.083 --> 06:03.575
- The Ginzo gang makes life he!!!
- Damn you!

07:38.833 --> 07:42.576
This must be quite a sight!

07:42.667 --> 07:46.364
l'm guiding a masseur
who's carrying my vegetables.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.574
Wish I could see that!

08:08.000 --> 08:10.662
You did me a big favour.

08:12.667 --> 08:14.498
Have some tea.

08:15.500 --> 08:17.991
- It's hot.
- Thank you.

08:22.333 --> 08:28.579
Without your help,
I wouldn't have made it home.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.082
Where will you sleep tonight?

08:36.333 --> 08:39.291
Must be your first time around here.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.582
You're welcome to stay here.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.578
| live alone.

08:47.500 --> 08:50.412
Don't get any ideas.

08:50.500 --> 08:53.333
I don't have any.

09:10.333 --> 09:13.951
- Too hard?
- No, it's just right.

09:17.583 --> 09:21.155
I hate thinking the town is doomed.

09:21.250 --> 09:26.825
Ginzo and Ogi have teamed up.
They're running the town at will.

09:26.917 --> 09:30.785
You really have such crooks?

09:30.875 --> 09:33.662
They bully the farmers around.

09:33.750 --> 09:37.072
And the townspeople, too.

09:38.167 --> 09:41.739
They demand protection money
every day.

09:41.833 --> 09:47.328
At this rate, the more we work,
the poorer we get.

09:47.417 --> 09:51.535
You pay protection money daily?

09:51.625 --> 09:54.913
Before, no.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.537
We used to pay only monthly.

09:58.333 --> 10:01.780
Big difference
between monthly and daily.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.911
Exactly.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.991
Are you all right?

10:31.167 --> 10:34.034
We'll stay here a while.

10:34.125 --> 10:37.617
I'll work as a bodyguard again.

10:37.708 --> 10:40.324
You shouldn't worry about me.

10:40.417 --> 10:44.740
Don't do that kind of work
for my sake.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.537
I'll get an official post again someday.

10:49.625 --> 10:52.162
Stop worrying. You need rest.

11:14.167 --> 11:17.739
Hey, Pops! Where's Gramps?

11:17.833 --> 11:21.405
He's sick in bed.
Won't be coming in today.

11:21.500 --> 11:24.822
- You work him too much.
- Sorry.

11:24.917 --> 11:27.750
Take better care of him.

11:27.833 --> 11:32.247
- The saké is horrible as usual.
- Can't get anything better.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.780
Same story for ten years!

11:35.875 --> 11:40.824
Can you hand this
to that guy over there?

11:40.917 --> 11:43.909
I don't work for you!

11:44.000 --> 11:46.332
What nerve!

11:49.583 --> 11:52.700
Can't get it yourself?

11:52.792 --> 11:55.784
Drink at the counter!

12:10.375 --> 12:12.206
W-w-welcome.

12:17.542 --> 12:23.367
Welcome, my ass!
Where's this month's payment?

12:23.458 --> 12:28.873
- Please give me more time.
- What a joke!

12:28.958 --> 12:32.826
- We don't wait!
- I'll work things out.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.999
My regards to your boss.

12:35.083 --> 12:37.415
Your saké is disgusting!

12:37.500 --> 12:39.491
Shut up!

12:49.708 --> 12:52.450
What do you want?

13:00.500 --> 13:02.832
Send a message to your boss.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.954
Skilled ronin
seeks position as bodyguard.

13:30.333 --> 13:34.531
It's late.
The Ginzo boss may not come.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.950
Masterless samurai,
are you the one?

14:06.042 --> 14:08.954
The one who seeks work
as a bodyguard?

14:14.542 --> 14:17.659
Show me your skills.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.457
That's very good.

14:39.917 --> 14:43.580
Not the cord.
Look at your foot.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.582
Masseur, I'm going to the fields.

15:05.667 --> 15:10.866
Tell me, ma'am.
Is there anything I can do to help?

15:10.958 --> 15:13.415
Thank you for offering.

15:13.500 --> 15:16.742
But I couldn't ask
a sight-impaired man to chop wood.

15:18.708 --> 15:22.200
Don't worry. Relax.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.373
Dear...

15:45.083 --> 15:50.203
You returned late last night.
Did something happen?

15:50.292 --> 15:52.783
I found a good job.

15:56.500 --> 16:00.243
Another position as a bodyguard?

16:00.333 --> 16:04.702
I beg you, not for my sake.

16:06.250 --> 16:09.868
I beg you, please stop taking such jobs.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.412
Don't be silly.

16:13.500 --> 16:16.788
With money, you could be cured.

16:33.958 --> 16:36.700
Tell me...

16:37.208 --> 16:39.745
Did you hire that ronin?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.289
Yes.

16:41.375 --> 16:44.993
We have two problems to take care of.

16:45.917 --> 16:50.911
We must destroy both clans,
the lzutsu and the Funahachi.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.164
Then this post town will be yours, boss.

16:56.167 --> 16:59.864
Try not to be too rough.

16:59.958 --> 17:03.075
Understood. Don't worry.

17:09.000 --> 17:13.198
By the way,
any news on Heihachi's murder?

17:14.208 --> 17:18.827
Some rumours.
They say a geisha killed him.

17:19.917 --> 17:23.239
That's all we know for now.

18:13.542 --> 18:17.364
- Another bowl, masseur?
- No, thanks.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.291
I'm full. Thank you very much.

18:23.833 --> 18:28.748
Ma'am, when l was chopping wood,

18:28.833 --> 18:31.540
this guy ran around the house.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.241
What was all that about?

18:34.333 --> 18:37.996
The neighbour's son. A certified idiot.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.911
Pay him no mind.

18:41.000 --> 18:45.915
He dreams of being a samurai.
He runs around like that all day.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.452
A samurai!

18:51.917 --> 18:53.453
I'm going out a while.

18:53.542 --> 18:57.831
- For work?
- Not exactly.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.536
For this.

19:01.625 --> 19:05.538
What? You're going gambling?

19:05.625 --> 19:09.072
Better to stay away from that.

19:10.083 --> 19:14.031
My nephew, he's addicted to gambling.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.993
He refuses to work, plays all day.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.199
Don't know...

19:20.292 --> 19:22.624
He dropped out of sight.

19:22.708 --> 19:26.155
For me, it's just a pastime.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.989
Some pastimes can become too serious.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.994
What do you think?

19:53.167 --> 19:57.080
This sword cost me a fortune.

19:57.167 --> 20:01.536
- Yes, Mr Ogi, it's a fine sword.
- I'm giving it to Lord Sakai.

20:01.625 --> 20:05.573
He'll be so pleased
that he'll do us business favours.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.157
Of course.

20:08.167 --> 20:12.581
Actually... try it out
on the first beggar who comes by.

20:15.333 --> 20:18.075
Thanks, sir. But you go ahead.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.954
Out of the question!
I won't dirty my kimono!

20:21.042 --> 20:24.739
- You do it!
- Why not hire a ronin?

20:24.833 --> 20:25.788
Fool!

20:25.875 --> 20:28.833
Hire a ronin just to test a sword?

20:28.917 --> 20:30.498
- Do as I say!
- But...

20:30.583 --> 20:32.869
Someone's coming!

20:33.500 --> 20:35.741
Slay that blind man.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.994
Hurry up!

21:20.625 --> 21:22.115
My... my sword!

21:22.208 --> 21:23.618
I'm so sorry!

21:25.167 --> 21:27.749
You fool!

21:30.667 --> 21:32.703
Game!

21:32.792 --> 21:33.907
3 and 1, even.

21:43.667 --> 21:45.578
New game!

21:45.667 --> 21:49.159
Any objections? Any objections?

21:54.917 --> 21:56.077
Ouch!

21:56.167 --> 21:57.156
A blind man?

21:57.250 --> 21:58.990
Sit here, blind man.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.120
I'm a masseur.

22:02.542 --> 22:04.078
Even.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.828
Bets are placed.

22:05.917 --> 22:07.782
Game.

22:08.792 --> 22:10.157
3 and 2, odd.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.870
I'm out of luck.

22:22.042 --> 22:23.748
New game.

22:23.833 --> 22:25.664
Objections?

22:25.833 --> 22:27.994
Objections?

22:32.292 --> 22:34.624
Odd.

22:38.583 --> 22:43.282
- Aren't you betting?
- I'll just watch for now.

22:43.375 --> 22:46.037
Watch? But you're blind.

22:47.042 --> 22:48.498
1 and 1, even.

22:58.833 --> 23:00.915
Boss!

23:04.667 --> 23:07.579
The bodyguard is here.

23:21.792 --> 23:24.158
- Place your bets.
- Odd.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.457
Even.

23:34.375 --> 23:35.581
Even.

23:35.667 --> 23:37.248
Bets are placed.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.324
Game.

23:39.833 --> 23:42.495
4 and 2, even.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.699
New game.

23:53.792 --> 23:55.578
Any objections?

23:56.583 --> 23:57.197
Objections?

24:00.917 --> 24:03.909
- Is that them?
- Yes.

24:38.750 --> 24:42.493
Stop! Please don't!

25:29.333 --> 25:34.157
It's done.
Mr Ogi's worries are over for now.

25:59.833 --> 26:02.495
Welcome.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.365
Yes.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.957
Pops...

26:19.042 --> 26:21.249
Can I have more saké too?

26:21.333 --> 26:22.823
Yes.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.244
Samurai...

26:41.417 --> 26:43.078
Masseur...

26:45.417 --> 26:49.160
Your cane! I'm so sorry.

26:52.208 --> 26:56.907
What a beautiful cane!

27:08.125 --> 27:11.822
Well, masseur...

27:17.750 --> 27:20.162
You're no ordinary masseur.

27:21.250 --> 27:24.083
| smell blood on you, too.

27:29.625 --> 27:31.786
It's a little cramped in here.

27:31.875 --> 27:35.572
No use drawing your sword like that.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.698
Dear...

28:05.583 --> 28:09.121
Did you have to kill again?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.581
Idiot!

28:29.333 --> 28:31.915
It's too early for this racket.

28:32.000 --> 28:35.868
Go home. Battle time is over.

28:49.375 --> 28:53.914
The masseur didn't come home last night.

28:54.000 --> 28:57.868
Maybe he got lucky.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.081
Sir!

29:13.000 --> 29:15.867
I'll take this to Lord Sakai.

29:17.458 --> 29:19.790
Wait.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.913
On your way back,

29:25.000 --> 29:28.367
treat yourself to something tasty.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.832
Thank you, sir!

30:18.458 --> 30:20.790
Next! Kaneko Heishiro!

30:44.917 --> 30:48.489
Some ronin are very powerful.

30:49.542 --> 30:52.375
Hattori will be the one to face them.

31:54.250 --> 31:56.457
Coward!

31:56.542 --> 32:00.080
Using sticks isn't the art of combat!

32:01.083 --> 32:03.745
A true samurai will use his sword!

33:14.667 --> 33:17.500
You Yamaji lsaburo?

33:20.667 --> 33:23.033
Yes.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.741
And who are you?

33:26.833 --> 33:28.869
Hattori Gennosuke.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.867
I must slay you to regain my honour.

33:32.958 --> 33:35.916
Get your sword!

33:38.167 --> 33:40.829
Kill me, if you want.

33:41.833 --> 33:46.873
I don't have...
I have never had a sword.

33:48.958 --> 33:51.370
Where is the glory...

33:53.500 --> 33:57.163
in killing an invalid like me?

34:08.458 --> 34:11.996
Using sticks isn't the art of combat!

34:13.000 --> 34:16.117
A true samurai will use his sword!

34:51.667 --> 34:55.205
He's as good as dead.
Not worth killing.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.911
Hurry up!

35:21.333 --> 35:23.790
Isn't that better?

35:28.125 --> 35:30.332
2 and 3, odd.

35:40.875 --> 35:43.287
New game.

35:43.375 --> 35:46.037
Objections?

35:46.125 --> 35:48.787
Place your bets.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.081
What should I bet?

35:56.167 --> 35:57.998
Odd.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.949
Can I join you?

36:03.583 --> 36:06.655
- Odd!
- Bets are placed.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.661
Game.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.874
4 and 1, odd.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.241
Yeah! Over here!

36:49.042 --> 36:52.534
Masseur, it's full of fine women.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.457
Sir!

36:57.542 --> 36:59.578
You look like a winner.

37:01.500 --> 37:05.163
Thanks to this masseur,
I hit the jackpot.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.912
So why not buy a night with us?

37:11.458 --> 37:14.575
Masseur, should we have a little fun?

37:18.208 --> 37:21.280
I'll talk to the madam.
I'll find five or six geishas.

37:21.375 --> 37:26.074
I'll take care of it, young master.

37:26.167 --> 37:29.830
Stay here. I'll go.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.448
Ouch! That hurts!

37:32.542 --> 37:34.999
I'm not a bunny.

37:35.083 --> 37:36.948
Don't pull my ears!

37:37.042 --> 37:40.205
No need to get violent!

37:42.250 --> 37:44.662
Don't be naughty!

37:46.458 --> 37:49.245
So much? Impossible!

37:49.333 --> 37:52.166
Ouch! That hurts!

37:54.958 --> 37:57.665
Could I stand a small needle?

37:57.750 --> 38:01.242
No, the smaller the needle,

38:01.333 --> 38:04.951
the bigger the pain!

38:05.042 --> 38:07.658
Very funny! Come over here.

38:07.750 --> 38:12.073
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.082
Really funny!
See that, masseur?

38:17.083 --> 38:19.620
I don't see much.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.783
Osei, ready to dance?

38:29.667 --> 38:31.874
Dance? Great!

38:31.958 --> 38:34.074
Go on, dance!

38:39.208 --> 38:40.539
Miss Okinu,

38:41.542 --> 38:43.908
why did you loosen the strings?

38:47.125 --> 38:50.322
Are you after our money?

38:55.667 --> 38:58.283
And you, Miss Osei.

39:00.292 --> 39:01.873
Aren't you a man?

39:04.958 --> 39:07.119
You don't smell like a woman.

39:08.250 --> 39:13.244
The blind,
they're sensitive to such things.

39:16.958 --> 39:19.495
A hidden dagger?

39:20.667 --> 39:23.579
What's all this about?

39:48.375 --> 39:50.081
Masseur...

39:51.083 --> 39:53.449
You may think I'm lying,

39:53.542 --> 39:56.614
but I will tell you the truth.

39:59.000 --> 40:03.949
Our father,
he was a wealthy rice merchant.

40:19.333 --> 40:22.166
Come and see Cotton.

40:55.333 --> 40:57.665
Don't tell anyone.

41:31.208 --> 41:33.540
Heihachi...

41:34.125 --> 41:36.616
You have endured seven long years.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.658
- Heihachi, where is it hidden?
- This way.

41:44.750 --> 41:47.708
- How many are there?
- The Naruto couple, their two children,

41:47.792 --> 41:49.532
three maids and four clerks.

42:47.375 --> 42:50.208
Tashichi, what did you find?

42:50.292 --> 42:54.365
Eight strongboxes of money.
They saved a fortune!

42:54.458 --> 42:57.700
lnosuke, we're set for life!

42:57.792 --> 43:00.864
Get the Kuchinawa boss.

43:05.458 --> 43:08.746
Did you kill everyone in the house?

43:08.833 --> 43:10.994
What about the kids?

43:11.083 --> 43:14.200
They're nowhere to be found.

43:14.292 --> 43:15.577
Fool!

43:16.667 --> 43:19.659
We're out of time. Let's go.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.540
We tracked down Heihachi, the clerk...

43:50.625 --> 43:51.956
What are you doing?

43:52.042 --> 43:57.207
You were the Naruto family's clerk.
Don't you recognise us?

43:58.208 --> 44:01.905
- The Naruto family?
- I'm the daughter!

44:05.000 --> 44:08.822
As for the others, I only know names.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.331
Tell me.

44:14.333 --> 44:17.166
lnosuke and Tashichi.

44:17.250 --> 44:20.538
They also spoke of the Kuchinawa boss.

44:21.542 --> 44:23.624
That's all we know.

44:24.625 --> 44:27.822
And you've searched all these years?

44:36.458 --> 44:37.948
Even.

44:39.958 --> 44:41.494
Wrong again!

44:44.042 --> 44:47.330
I'll try with my eyes closed, like him.

44:48.500 --> 44:52.163
How does he do it by listening?

44:57.208 --> 44:59.494
I'm so unlucky!

45:08.083 --> 45:10.290
One rolled away!

45:10.375 --> 45:12.707
That's the problem.

45:16.167 --> 45:17.828
Odd.

45:25.667 --> 45:27.453
Even.

45:33.417 --> 45:35.248
Odd.

45:38.250 --> 45:40.491
I think I got it.

45:40.583 --> 45:45.122
My senses are sharper
with my eyes closed.

45:45.208 --> 45:46.448
OK!

45:47.375 --> 45:50.162
Place your bets.

45:55.292 --> 45:59.786
Shinkichi! You're just
sitting with your eyes closed.

45:59.875 --> 46:02.082
Aren't you betting?

46:02.167 --> 46:04.829
I'm listening.

46:04.917 --> 46:10.241
What? Sitting up front just to listen?

46:11.833 --> 46:13.915
l have the right to listen.

46:14.000 --> 46:18.448
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Don't put on airs!

46:18.542 --> 46:20.908
This dump needs all the clients
it can get.

46:21.000 --> 46:22.115
Bastard!

46:22.208 --> 46:24.665
Easy, Shinkichi!

46:25.833 --> 46:29.746
You can listen and bet at the same time.

46:30.167 --> 46:34.661
Calling me by my first name?
That's no way to speak to a client!

46:34.750 --> 46:37.082
A client?

46:37.167 --> 46:40.409
You used to work for me.

46:40.500 --> 46:43.333
Shut up and bet!

46:43.417 --> 46:47.080
You asked for it.

46:49.333 --> 46:52.530
The last sound was...

46:55.917 --> 46:57.782
OK...

47:02.250 --> 47:03.285
Odd!

47:04.417 --> 47:05.406
Odd.

47:06.333 --> 47:08.039
Game.

47:10.542 --> 47:13.033
4 and 2, even!

47:22.458 --> 47:24.323
So?

47:26.500 --> 47:29.162
- A message for your boss.
- What?

47:29.250 --> 47:31.957
Drop dead!

48:18.000 --> 48:20.662
- ls Mrs lzutsu in?
- One moment, please.

48:35.333 --> 48:39.702
May | ask what business you have here?

48:46.208 --> 48:50.076
Your dead husband has gambling debts
to my establishment.

48:50.167 --> 48:52.658
- I'm taking your store.
- What?

48:52.750 --> 48:54.786
You have three days to vacate.

48:54.875 --> 48:56.786
Not one day more.

48:56.875 --> 48:59.457
- This is madness!
- Shut up!

48:59.542 --> 49:01.828
Don't interfere!

49:20.208 --> 49:22.574
See those beauties?

49:22.667 --> 49:25.409
- Know them?
- Nope.

49:25.500 --> 49:28.116
| wish! The one in red is hot.

49:36.958 --> 49:39.791
More saké, please.

49:41.500 --> 49:42.990
Osei...

49:43.083 --> 49:46.075
Should we ask around for work?

49:48.208 --> 49:49.994
Sir?

49:50.083 --> 49:52.745
Do you know a place
where we could offer our services?

49:52.833 --> 49:54.915
Business has been slow
and we're available.

49:55.000 --> 49:58.822
- Do you know of anyone?
- You should try Mr Ogi.

49:58.917 --> 50:03.411
He runs everything now,
thanks to Ginzo.

50:03.500 --> 50:07.072
This Mr Ogi.
Can you introduce us to him?

50:07.167 --> 50:11.160
Pops, give those ladies a hand.

50:13.250 --> 50:17.198
Gramps, go and see Ogi.

50:17.292 --> 50:21.331
Go yourself, bastard!
Stop exploiting the old man!

50:21.417 --> 50:23.157
Hurry up!

50:30.500 --> 50:32.832
Watch it turn!

50:49.625 --> 50:51.035
Boss!

50:53.750 --> 50:56.992
The tavern owner
recommends two geishas.

50:57.083 --> 50:58.948
They're available this evening.

50:59.042 --> 51:01.909
Excellent. Send them over!

51:02.000 --> 51:04.742
You two, beat it!

51:04.833 --> 51:09.281
Lord Sakai, we'll soon be
in the company of two gorgeous women.

51:09.375 --> 51:11.161
Hurry up.

51:15.958 --> 51:20.122
- What's next?
- Even.

51:23.625 --> 51:25.240
Even!

51:25.333 --> 51:26.038
Bets are placed.

51:27.375 --> 51:28.831
Game.

51:30.250 --> 51:31.956
5 and 3, even.

51:32.125 --> 51:33.990
A winner!

51:39.500 --> 51:41.491
Watch!

52:08.167 --> 52:09.577
Ogi!

52:09.667 --> 52:12.079
Must I watch this much longer?

52:12.167 --> 52:15.159
Let's have some dancing!

52:15.250 --> 52:19.118
Show's over! Beat it!

52:19.208 --> 52:21.324
Time to dance, girls!

52:21.417 --> 52:24.079
Hurry up! Dance!

52:27.583 --> 52:29.744
Place your bets.

52:36.333 --> 52:38.449
Odd.

52:38.542 --> 52:40.624
Bets are placed.

52:40.708 --> 52:42.164
Game.

52:43.833 --> 52:46.199
4 and 1, odd.

53:19.667 --> 53:23.330
Masseur, should we bet it all?

53:24.917 --> 53:26.373
OK.

53:33.333 --> 53:34.618
New game.

53:38.292 --> 53:42.160
Objections?

53:47.125 --> 53:48.114
Hey!

53:51.250 --> 53:53.957
The dice don't sound the same.

53:55.167 --> 53:57.704
Damned masseur!

54:26.250 --> 54:27.865
Master...

54:34.000 --> 54:37.948
Some masseur is tearing up
the gambling house.

54:38.042 --> 54:40.658
Boss wants you to go there.

54:40.750 --> 54:42.411
A masseur?

54:42.500 --> 54:44.661
Please, sir.

55:18.917 --> 55:22.409
- You're coming with me.
- Let me go.

55:22.500 --> 55:25.412
- Come on.
- Do as he says!

55:26.667 --> 55:28.874
Don't touch me!

56:05.625 --> 56:07.081
You OK?

56:08.083 --> 56:09.664
Watch your step.

56:11.333 --> 56:12.493
Ouch!

56:13.917 --> 56:16.124
Be careful!

56:18.250 --> 56:20.992
What are you looking at?

56:21.083 --> 56:23.074
Masseur...

56:24.917 --> 56:29.411
Wait here.
I'll see what's happening.

56:33.375 --> 56:34.330
Ouch!

57:08.333 --> 57:11.951
Ladies, this way. Hurry!

57:16.792 --> 57:19.989
That Ogi is a horrible man!

57:20.083 --> 57:23.701
I hit him, and we took off
when the client tried to take Osei.

57:25.875 --> 57:29.572
We ran into trouble at Ginzo's place.

57:29.667 --> 57:32.534
But the masseur floored them all.

57:32.625 --> 57:37.324
It was unbelievable.
Who are you, anyway?

57:43.083 --> 57:46.325
They'll track us down here soon.

57:47.750 --> 57:53.541
- We should go to my aunt's house.
- Impossible. Ginzo's men are everywhere.

57:55.542 --> 57:58.033
That's true.

58:17.917 --> 58:21.330
l have an idea.
Okinu, do you have some make-up?

58:21.417 --> 58:22.247
Sure.

58:28.167 --> 58:30.749
Masseur, come here.

58:30.833 --> 58:32.619
- Don't move.
- What's that?

58:32.708 --> 58:35.905
- I'm drawing eyes.
- Eyes for me?

58:46.833 --> 58:48.949
Aunt Oume!

58:51.542 --> 58:54.079
- Who could it be at this hour?
- Open up!

58:58.167 --> 59:00.328
- Who is it?
- Your nephew Shinkichi.

59:00.417 --> 59:04.865
Shinkichi?
He must have lost everything again.

59:07.875 --> 59:11.413
- Come in.
- Who are these people?

59:11.500 --> 59:13.240
Careful, masseur.

59:13.333 --> 59:15.619
- Masseur!
- Yes, it's me.

59:19.583 --> 59:21.414
Useless fools!

59:21.500 --> 59:24.082
What about the bodyguard?

59:24.167 --> 59:29.867
It was all over by the time he arrived.
The masseur had already run off.

59:29.958 --> 59:36.659
- Who is this masseur?
- Don't know. Just some masseur.

59:36.750 --> 59:40.413
He had that punk Shinkichi with him.

59:40.958 --> 59:47.238
He's a regular at the joint.
He shouldn't be difficult to find.

59:47.333 --> 59:51.030
As for the masseur, we'll get him.

59:51.125 --> 59:56.700
First, we must wipe out
the Funahachi gang.

1:00:09.417 --> 1:00:11.658
It can't be...

1:00:14.500 --> 1:00:19.745
We found ourselves travelling
from town to town,

1:00:21.750 --> 1:00:24.662
tricking men and stealing their money.

1:00:26.917 --> 1:00:30.364
Ten years of that?

1:00:30.458 --> 1:00:34.201
Those bandits must be living
different lives by now.

1:00:35.167 --> 1:00:38.830
Wait. Didn't Ogi settle here ten years ago?

1:00:41.875 --> 1:00:47.620
In fact, that Ogi...
There's something not right about him.

1:00:47.708 --> 1:00:53.954
I saw his arm.
He has a snake tattoo.

1:00:55.042 --> 1:00:57.249
Wait a minute.

1:00:57.333 --> 1:01:02.123
Those names you mentioned...

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:05.200
Something about a Kuchinawa?

1:01:06.542 --> 1:01:09.033
Yes, that's right.

1:01:10.292 --> 1:01:15.867
"Kuchinawa" means "rotten rope".
And it's another name for a snake.

1:01:22.667 --> 1:01:25.033
Right?

1:01:26.833 --> 1:01:29.700
Masseur!

1:01:30.167 --> 1:01:33.079
Don't make those eyes at me!

1:01:38.958 --> 1:01:45.830
I heard about last night.
A masseur tore up your place.

1:01:45.917 --> 1:01:47.578
That's right.

1:01:47.667 --> 1:01:53.537
We rushed over with the bodyguard,
but we got there too late.

1:01:54.542 --> 1:01:56.874
- Ogi...
- Yes?

1:01:58.042 --> 1:02:02.285
What were the women like?

1:02:03.833 --> 1:02:07.280
Lord Sakai tried to carry one away.

1:02:07.375 --> 1:02:11.197
But the other one hit me real hard.

1:02:11.292 --> 1:02:16.958
Based on their moves,
they're no ordinary geishas.

1:02:17.042 --> 1:02:19.328
Listen...

1:02:20.333 --> 1:02:25.782
Find out everything you can
about that masseur and those geishas.

1:04:21.333 --> 1:04:24.166
- Game.
- Even.

1:04:24.250 --> 1:04:25.740
Odd.

1:04:27.458 --> 1:04:29.323
I won.

1:04:44.833 --> 1:04:49.497
This is my house!
Move! Go away!

1:05:15.333 --> 1:05:19.781
Are you still eating?
I told you to clean the house!

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:26.166
Little Seitaro,
the master would like to see you.

1:05:26.250 --> 1:05:29.208
You, clean up that mess!

1:05:29.292 --> 1:05:31.624
Come with me, Seitaro.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:26.072
How adorable you are!

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.572
From now on, you'll be my boy.

1:06:31.583 --> 1:06:36.703
As long as you do as I say,
you and your sister can stay here.

1:06:39.125 --> 1:06:44.995
Would that make you happy?
I'll buy you beautiful kimonos.

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:54.328
What are you doing?
Stay away from the master's room!

1:06:54.417 --> 1:06:56.078
No!

1:07:33.833 --> 1:07:35.539
Sir...

1:07:36.542 --> 1:07:39.454
Don't you want to spend time with me?

1:09:08.292 --> 1:09:09.748
Osei?

1:09:10.750 --> 1:09:13.742
It's time to practise.

1:12:11.333 --> 1:12:13.369
Sister?

1:12:14.375 --> 1:12:16.536
What's wrong?

1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.991
Sister?

1:12:25.333 --> 1:12:26.743
It's nothing.

1:12:26.833 --> 1:12:29.324
Are you all right?

1:12:48.167 --> 1:12:51.079
Aunt, do you have an umbrella?

1:12:51.167 --> 1:12:53.328
Over there.

1:12:55.375 --> 1:12:58.447
I'll go see what's happening in town.

1:14:05.583 --> 1:14:07.414
Thanks.

1:14:13.917 --> 1:14:18.911
- Gramps, where's Pops today?
- He has other business to tend to.

1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.833
That lazy bastard?

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:27.247
Gramps, why do you work in this dump?
No family to care for you?

1:14:27.333 --> 1:14:29.949
That's right.

1:14:30.042 --> 1:14:33.534
He took me off the streets
and gave me a job.

1:14:34.542 --> 1:14:40.242
He was good to me.
I'm thankful for all he did.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:46.743
Better to beg than work in this dump!

1:14:48.125 --> 1:14:51.617
Go out and sit on a straw mat
and you'll make more!

1:15:08.333 --> 1:15:09.914
5 and 1, even.

1:15:17.542 --> 1:15:18.702
New game.

1:15:20.792 --> 1:15:22.703
Objections?

1:15:37.417 --> 1:15:43.743
- What are you bastards doing here?
- Pay up, if you want to gamble.

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:48.122
Watch it!
This was our turf first.

1:15:48.208 --> 1:15:51.621
You making a fuss, bastard?

1:15:59.542 --> 1:16:02.329
You looking for trouble?

1:16:14.125 --> 1:16:18.289
Ginzo wants a showdown.

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.331
Stay back.

1:17:36.958 --> 1:17:38.038
Wow!

1:18:09.167 --> 1:18:10.247
Wait!

1:18:11.250 --> 1:18:13.161
Wait!

1:18:15.792 --> 1:18:17.248
It's over.

1:18:36.250 --> 1:18:38.912
That masseur...

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.868
Could he be Zatoichi?

1:18:42.958 --> 1:18:45.665
And those geishas...

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:49.493
They must be from the Naruto family.

1:18:49.583 --> 1:18:52.905
The Naruto heist...

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:55.787
How long ago was that?

1:18:56.792 --> 1:18:59.158
Ten years ago.

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:01.956
I see.

1:19:03.083 --> 1:19:09.158
If the children survived,
they would be of age by now.

1:19:11.667 --> 1:19:13.908
I wonder...

1:19:14.000 --> 1:19:19.996
That bodyguard.
Is he capable of defeating Zatoichi?

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:36.331
Where's Ogi?

1:20:10.292 --> 1:20:14.080
Boss Ginzo himself!
How nice of you to come!

1:20:14.167 --> 1:20:16.658
This way, please.

1:20:21.167 --> 1:20:24.489
I hear your business is doing well.

1:20:24.583 --> 1:20:28.576
- I asked you never to come here.
- Don't worry.

1:20:28.667 --> 1:20:33.206
Funahachi is history.
We run the show now.

1:20:33.292 --> 1:20:36.910
Only thing left to do
is fill our pockets.

1:20:45.500 --> 1:20:47.081
Clean this place up!

1:21:02.458 --> 1:21:03.743
Big news!

1:21:03.833 --> 1:21:06.540
They wiped out the Funahachi gang.

1:21:06.625 --> 1:21:11.915
The Ginzo gang and their bodyguard,
they slew every single one of them.

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:19.282
Really, that Ginzo hired
one hell of a bodyguard!

1:21:20.292 --> 1:21:23.864
Masseur, better stay away from town.

1:21:25.667 --> 1:21:30.741
Shinkichi, is the bodyguard
really that strong?

1:21:30.833 --> 1:21:33.324
He's incredible.

1:21:34.375 --> 1:21:39.244
If he and I fought at night,
who would be stronger?

1:21:43.042 --> 1:21:47.786
If it's pitch black,
neither one of you would see anything.

1:21:47.875 --> 1:21:51.038
You would probably be stronger.

1:22:01.875 --> 1:22:04.662
What's so funny?

1:22:04.750 --> 1:22:07.207
Let's see what you got.

1:22:07.292 --> 1:22:10.079
I'll train you. Come on!

1:22:10.167 --> 1:22:13.330
l'll teach you the art of combat.

1:22:15.250 --> 1:22:17.206
Concentrate.

1:22:18.208 --> 1:22:20.369
Let's begin.

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.582
Attack from any direction.

1:22:29.583 --> 1:22:32.074
Not all at the same time!

1:22:33.667 --> 1:22:37.580
Let's try again.
For safety's sake, let's plan the moves.

1:22:37.667 --> 1:22:39.077
Listen up.

1:22:39.167 --> 1:22:41.328
First, me...

1:22:41.917 --> 1:22:43.828
Like this...

1:22:43.917 --> 1:22:46.704
You strike here.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.331
Then”.

1:22:49.417 --> 1:22:50.953
you!

1:22:52.917 --> 1:22:54.407
And then you.

1:22:55.500 --> 1:22:56.455
Good.

1:22:57.458 --> 1:23:00.291
Let's give it a try.

1:23:02.083 --> 1:23:03.493
See?

1:23:06.833 --> 1:23:08.323
See what you can do?

1:23:08.417 --> 1:23:10.578
Now, faster.

1:23:14.917 --> 1:23:17.158
Good. That's it!

1:23:21.833 --> 1:23:24.540
Not like that!

1:23:27.792 --> 1:23:30.784
That hurts, idiots!

1:23:30.875 --> 1:23:34.868
Your lessons are over!
Assholes!

1:23:38.333 --> 1:23:40.619
What are you doing?

1:23:40.708 --> 1:23:42.699
Stupid boy! Go home.

1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.197
- I'll have a bath.
- Me, too.

1:23:57.875 --> 1:23:59.786
No! Men first.

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:02.366
I am a man!

1:24:21.500 --> 1:24:23.786
Masseur...

1:24:24.667 --> 1:24:30.037
I'm thinking of
paying Ogi another visit.

1:24:33.917 --> 1:24:38.536
l have to know if Ogi
was one of the bandits.

1:24:46.083 --> 1:24:49.450
The water's not hot enough.
Heat it up!

1:24:49.542 --> 1:24:52.705
Don't start! Bad enough,
taking a bath in broad daylight!

1:24:52.792 --> 1:24:54.407
Good-for-nothing!

1:24:54.500 --> 1:24:57.333
It's no good cold.
Please, heat it up.

1:24:57.417 --> 1:24:59.829
That's what I'm doing!

1:25:05.833 --> 1:25:08.870
l have to say it's incredible.

1:25:08.958 --> 1:25:12.780
You really look like a woman!

1:25:12.875 --> 1:25:16.447
Does make-up make men beautiful?

1:25:17.208 --> 1:25:20.245
It doesn't work on everyone.

1:25:20.333 --> 1:25:23.166
It depends on the face!

1:26:04.625 --> 1:26:06.581
Welcome...

1:26:11.250 --> 1:26:14.788
We would like to apologise to Mr Ogi.

1:26:15.792 --> 1:26:20.411
He hired us to perform,
and we were very rude to him.

1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:22.240
Really?

1:26:22.333 --> 1:26:25.700
Could you send him our apologies?

1:26:25.792 --> 1:26:28.659
Have a seat.

1:26:29.958 --> 1:26:33.871
Ogi can't hold his liquor.
He probably forgot already.

1:26:33.958 --> 1:26:35.289
Don't worry.

1:26:35.375 --> 1:26:37.912
I hope you're right.

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:42.744
You two haven't been around much lately.
Where have you been staying?

1:26:42.833 --> 1:26:45.825
Mrs Oume's place.

1:26:45.917 --> 1:26:47.657
Is the masseur with you?

1:26:47.750 --> 1:26:48.739
Yes.

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:57.491
- You all right, Gramps?
- Yes.

1:26:59.167 --> 1:27:01.658
Throw that out.

1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.241
Have a drink.

1:27:12.583 --> 1:27:13.572
Thank you.

1:27:13.667 --> 1:27:18.366
Ogi teamed up with Ginzo.
They must be up to something.

1:27:18.458 --> 1:27:23.157
But their business doesn't involve you.

1:27:24.167 --> 1:27:25.657
Would you like another?

1:27:25.750 --> 1:27:27.581
Not yet.

1:27:31.667 --> 1:27:36.036
I'll go to Ogi's now.
It will take a while.

1:27:36.125 --> 1:27:38.662
Wait here, ladies.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.743
Ogi says he's not angry at all.

1:28:32.833 --> 1:28:36.030
He likes you two,
and wants to see you both now.

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:36.955
Thank you very much.

1:28:37.792 --> 1:28:40.124
And thanks for the saké.

1:28:41.542 --> 1:28:43.908
Good luck.

1:28:53.958 --> 1:28:57.746
Where is everyone?

1:28:57.833 --> 1:29:01.621
They all went into town.

1:29:02.625 --> 1:29:06.447
What are you doing?

1:29:08.917 --> 1:29:11.750
Are you crazy?

1:29:11.833 --> 1:29:15.075
No. I want to be beautiful like Osei.

1:29:16.167 --> 1:29:17.452
What a shock!

1:31:04.333 --> 1:31:06.995
What's the racket?

1:31:07.083 --> 1:31:09.495
Back again, stupid boy?

1:31:10.500 --> 1:31:13.412
- Where's the masseur?
- Who are you?

1:31:13.500 --> 1:31:16.742
- We want the masseur.
- He's not here.

1:31:16.833 --> 1:31:18.915
You can't hide him.

1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:20.991
But he's not here.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.412
Then we'll smoke him out.

1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:26.661
Burn it down!

1:31:27.667 --> 1:31:29.828
Stop!

1:31:32.583 --> 1:31:34.869
Aunt Oumel There's trouble!

1:31:35.542 --> 1:31:38.909
The house is on fire!
Wake up!

1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:41.537
There's trouble!

1:31:41.625 --> 1:31:42.910
Let's go!

1:31:43.000 --> 1:31:45.992
- Hurry!
- Who are those men?

1:31:47.125 --> 1:31:49.286
Shinkichi!

1:31:57.917 --> 1:31:58.997
Damn!

1:33:23.250 --> 1:33:26.208
She's a very beautiful woman.

1:33:26.292 --> 1:33:28.203
Woman?

1:33:29.208 --> 1:33:33.622
Things aren't always
what they seem, lnosuke.

1:33:33.708 --> 1:33:35.915
Don't call me by my old name.

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.742
You never know who might be listening.

1:33:38.833 --> 1:33:41.950
My name is Ginzo now.

1:33:47.708 --> 1:33:49.744
What are you looking at?

1:33:49.833 --> 1:33:52.074
Keep dancing!

1:33:52.167 --> 1:33:54.658
We know everything.

1:33:54.750 --> 1:33:58.197
You're the Naruto children!

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:05.991
OK.

1:34:53.292 --> 1:34:56.955
- Masseur!
- Ladies, leave now.

1:35:12.542 --> 1:35:15.033
Get the bodyguard.

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:59.447
lnosuke, where are you going?

1:36:51.917 --> 1:36:54.408
- Where's the bodyguard?
- At home.

1:36:54.500 --> 1:36:56.661
Get him now!

1:37:37.417 --> 1:37:39.157
Give me that sword!

1:40:41.875 --> 1:40:44.082
Child turtle on its back.

1:40:44.167 --> 1:40:47.284
Grandchild turtle
on child turtle's back.

1:40:47.375 --> 1:40:51.414
Great-grandchild turtle
on grandchild turtle's back.

1:40:51.500 --> 1:40:53.286
If mother turtle falls,

1:40:53.375 --> 1:40:56.867
child, grandchild
and great-grandchild turtles fall, too.

1:41:58.667 --> 1:42:01.329
All the bandits are dead.

1:42:04.042 --> 1:42:07.114
Except the Kuchinawa boss.

1:42:08.125 --> 1:42:12.414
He must be pretty old by now.

1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:16.163
He'll be dead soon enough.

1:42:17.167 --> 1:42:22.912
Don't think of him.
Better to think of your future.

1:42:24.500 --> 1:42:28.368
You could settle down here.

1:42:29.375 --> 1:42:31.582
You could become a man again.

1:42:32.583 --> 1:42:35.495
This way suits me just fine.

1:42:40.667 --> 1:42:43.534
Where did the masseur go off to?

1:42:44.542 --> 1:42:47.204
He's off wandering somewhere.

1:42:51.208 --> 1:42:54.120
But the festival begins today.

1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.537
You found me out.

1:44:10.625 --> 1:44:12.240
How did you know?

1:44:12.333 --> 1:44:15.120
The stench.

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:20.869
Disguise yourself all you want,
your rotten stench will never go away.

1:44:21.667 --> 1:44:25.580
Stop blabbering, you blind bat!

1:44:25.667 --> 1:44:30.411
I'm proud to let it be known
that I'm the Kuchinawa boss.

1:44:30.500 --> 1:44:33.367
A blind man like you...

1:44:33.458 --> 1:44:36.450
You won't slay me easily!

1:44:42.083 --> 1:44:44.119
What the hell...?

1:44:44.208 --> 1:44:47.496
- You're not blind?
- Not at all.

1:44:47.583 --> 1:44:49.869
Why do you act blind?

1:44:51.500 --> 1:44:55.948
Because the blind,
they sense people better.

1:46:57.167 --> 1:47:00.125
I knew you could see!

1:47:00.208 --> 1:47:04.076
I knew the first time you came here.

1:47:04.167 --> 1:47:09.036
You're the one who killed my men.

1:47:10.750 --> 1:47:13.082
Torakichi, too?

1:47:15.333 --> 1:47:17.824
You killed the tavern owner?

1:47:18.833 --> 1:47:24.282
He was just a street kid.
I took him in years ago.

1:47:25.292 --> 1:47:31.413
I showed him the tricks of the trade
so he could become my successor.

1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:34.333
My whole gang destroyed,

1:47:35.333 --> 1:47:39.155
by a wandering masseur like you!

1:47:41.208 --> 1:47:47.033
How did you know
I was the real Kuchinawa boss?

1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:54.245
When you knocked down my cane
to check out the sword.

1:47:54.333 --> 1:47:57.200
You're the worst crook of all.

1:47:58.250 --> 1:47:59.831
Is that so?

1:48:00.792 --> 1:48:06.833
Not much more I can do.
The time has come for me to retire.

1:48:06.917 --> 1:48:10.956
But I've lived a full life.

1:48:11.958 --> 1:48:15.371
l have no regrets.

1:48:16.375 --> 1:48:18.616
Go on. Kill me!

1:48:25.833 --> 1:48:28.745
Death is too good for you.

1:48:28.833 --> 1:48:31.996
Finish your life as a blind man!

1:52:26.042 --> 1:52:28.658
Even with my eyes wide open,

1:52:28.750 --> 1:52:31.992
I can't see a thing!

1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:32.034
I can't see a thing!
