WEBVTT

00:02.261 --> 00:05.421
You don't run this prison. I do.

00:06.508 --> 00:09.347
Please, just leave me alone!

00:09.468 --> 00:11.707
The Governor has agreed on
your release.

00:11.827 --> 00:13.468
She wants me out of here
so she can get to Jodie.

00:13.588 --> 00:16.667
She came in last night. She did
something to her. She was crying.

00:16.748 --> 00:18.228
Smith!

00:18.307 --> 00:19.788
Someone thinks you're a hero.

00:19.868 --> 00:22.147
Kaz Proctor? Sounds like a nut case.

00:22.268 --> 00:26.307
Ms Bennett has kindly agreed to
withdraw the verbal abuse charge.

00:26.388 --> 00:28.108
Now, there are conditions, first

00:28.228 --> 00:31.348
that you attend regular counselling
sessions, starting tomorrow.

00:31.468 --> 00:34.587
Thanks, Gidget.
Have you been drinking?

00:34.707 --> 00:37.307
You do not get to
lecture me about drinking!

00:37.427 --> 00:39.027
When you drink, love,
you're vulnerable.

00:39.147 --> 00:42.347
When I drink, I forget
that my mum ruined my life.

00:42.427 --> 00:43.987
Soph, I'm sorry.

00:44.067 --> 00:45.787
Did they find some DNA at the scene?

00:45.867 --> 00:46.948
Is that why they're testing you?

00:47.067 --> 00:49.387
I was at the house
the night he died.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

02:25.948 --> 02:28.548
You're so beautiful.

02:36.828 --> 02:38.948
Hello, lover.

02:42.788 --> 02:44.948
Get that in my honour, love.

02:44.969 --> 02:46.829
He's got a lot of
friends in D Block.

02:46.841 --> 02:48.649
They've got some
condiment racket going on.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.969
They want to trade Cindy's crew
for some chop-chop.

02:51.088 --> 02:53.609
I said, "Trade ahead,
as long as you keep it at herbs,

02:53.729 --> 02:56.609
spices and soy sauce. Anything
of the pharmacological variety...

02:56.729 --> 02:59.329
So, the obstetrician's
coming tomorrow at 12.00, Liz.

03:00.849 --> 03:02.849
Liz.
Sorry, what?

03:02.969 --> 03:06.889
I said my obstetrician's coming
tomorrow at 12.00. For my check-up.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.808
Oh, right.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.368
So, you'll be there, yeah?

03:11.449 --> 03:13.649
Yeah, yeah, I wouldn't miss it.

03:13.729 --> 03:14.729
You OK, Liz?

03:14.959 --> 03:17.719
Nah, I think I need some wakey
juice. Does anybody want a cuppa?

03:17.799 --> 03:19.279
- No, love.
- No. No, thanks.

03:19.298 --> 03:20.578
Boomer?
No!

03:21.277 --> 03:23.537
I'll come with you, Dor,
to see the baby doc.

03:23.558 --> 03:27.438
Oh, thanks, Jess, but Liz
is my nominated carer, so...

03:27.451 --> 03:29.692
Oh, yeah, I just meant
if Liz can't make it.

03:29.812 --> 03:32.731
For any reason.
Thanks.

03:32.853 --> 03:36.933
You kept me awake with your telly
blaring half the fuckin' night.

03:37.052 --> 03:39.692
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Had bloody heartburn.

03:39.772 --> 03:41.412
You know what helps?

03:41.532 --> 03:44.012
What?
Ginger tea and a good fuck.

03:44.132 --> 03:48.252
Homey bird like you,
I bet you go like the Ganges.

03:48.332 --> 03:50.252
Don't worry, Lizzie.

03:50.332 --> 03:52.212
Laggers aren't my type.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.372
Well, that's good, cos
hep C-infected lezzos aren't mine.

04:00.797 --> 04:02.356
Oh, here she is!

04:02.437 --> 04:04.117
Fuckin' wog slag.

04:04.197 --> 04:05.397
Dirty fuckin' dog.

04:06.797 --> 04:08.117
Nice holiday, love?

04:09.957 --> 04:11.517
OK, settle down.

04:13.557 --> 04:15.076
You look like shit.

04:18.276 --> 04:19.637
You gonna talk to me?

04:24.437 --> 04:26.437
Let's keep an eye on Jodie, yeah?

04:30.477 --> 04:33.757
Jenkins. That's enough. Coulter.

04:47.477 --> 04:50.157
So, what if it's genetic?

04:50.276 --> 04:53.477
Sure, there's growing evidence
to support a genetic link with

04:53.557 --> 04:56.357
alcoholism, I won't lie to you.

04:56.437 --> 04:57.956
Love, when Soph was 11,

04:58.076 --> 05:01.757
she watched her alky mother mow
her nan down with a bloody tractor.

05:01.836 --> 05:04.276
We can't change the past, OK?

05:04.396 --> 05:09.516
But what we can do now is
concentrate on what we can control.

05:09.637 --> 05:12.637
Yeah, but I can't control bloody
anything, cos I'm stuck in here

05:12.716 --> 05:14.516
and she's out there. You know,

05:14.637 --> 05:16.237
when I called her the other
day, I could hardly get any

05:16.317 --> 05:18.997
bloody sense out of her.

05:19.117 --> 05:21.637
I mean, what if she's
gone and got pissed again,

05:21.716 --> 05:23.877
and some bloke has raped her?

05:23.956 --> 05:25.437
What makes you say that?

05:25.557 --> 05:28.157
Cos you didn't hear her voice
on the phone.

05:28.276 --> 05:31.997
Something's wrong.
Can you try calling her again?

05:32.117 --> 05:33.557
I've tried, and they see
the number calling and they

05:33.677 --> 05:37.477
don't pick up. I'm stuffed.
She's got a lot of support.

05:37.597 --> 05:40.396
She's got her father...
Should be me.

05:40.477 --> 05:42.396
It should have always been me.

05:44.956 --> 05:47.076
Let's stay here all day.

05:47.197 --> 05:50.877
Boss might get suss if we
both pull a sickie.

05:50.997 --> 05:53.997
What's she gonna do, huh?
Give us a stern talking to?

05:54.076 --> 05:57.677
You know they call her The Freak.

05:57.797 --> 05:59.997
Who?
The prisoners.

06:00.117 --> 06:03.317
Well, she is a bit scary.
Nah, she's a pussycat.

06:03.437 --> 06:05.076
You've just got to know
where to scratch her, the Guv.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.157
Oh, reowr!

06:20.357 --> 06:22.037
Don't worry, they'll get the message.

06:22.157 --> 06:23.716
Oh, what if it's The Freak
come to bust us in the act?

06:23.836 --> 06:26.477
Then they'll have to
break the door down.

06:26.597 --> 06:29.557
Jesus!
What the hell?

06:37.317 --> 06:39.117
Mr Jackson, you didn't
answer our knocking.

06:39.197 --> 06:40.597
Oh, so you broke my fucking door!

06:40.716 --> 06:43.597
Which this warrant gives me the
right to do, if you refuse access.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.037
Take your time to
read over the paperwork.

06:50.157 --> 06:53.076
We're here to search the premises,
inside and out. Let's go, boys.

06:53.197 --> 06:54.716
Come on.
What for?

06:54.797 --> 06:56.477
It's all detailed there.

06:56.557 --> 06:59.477
Are you serious?

06:59.597 --> 07:01.157
Will, I'll see
you later on, alright?

07:01.237 --> 07:02.396
OK.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.497
Ah, hang on, Miss.
Sorry. Detective!

07:03.516 --> 07:06.437
We're going to
have to check your bag.

07:10.597 --> 07:13.117
Only reason I'm not
arresting you right now,

07:13.237 --> 07:16.797
your DNA came back negative on
the DNA found at Smith's house.

07:16.877 --> 07:19.117
So why are you even here?

07:19.237 --> 07:21.117
By your own admission,
you were at the scene.

07:25.437 --> 07:28.477
OK, you can go.

07:28.597 --> 07:31.276
I'll see you later on.
Rose, are you OK?

07:31.396 --> 07:34.076
Yeah, yeah. You need to sort out
this stuff. I'll talk to you later.

07:55.237 --> 07:58.396
New tat. Looks painful.

07:58.516 --> 08:01.477
Oh, there's pleasure in pain,
Gidge. Bet you can't wait to

08:01.597 --> 08:03.237
sink your diagnostic
hooks into that one.

08:03.357 --> 08:05.477
Oh, so you scarred
yourself for my benefit?

08:05.597 --> 08:07.997
Ooh, not quite.
Better not forget our session

08:08.117 --> 08:10.516
tomorrow, then.
Counting down the hours.

08:10.637 --> 08:13.477
Good, because I need at least 12
hours so I can write up this report

08:13.557 --> 08:14.716
for the parole board.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.437
Now you're turning me on.

08:21.276 --> 08:25.677
Well, I'd rather you were
motivated than aroused.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.597
Pollies are nervous, you know.
Pressure's on to keep you guys

08:28.716 --> 08:31.516
locked up. This report is
more important than ever.

08:31.637 --> 08:33.796
Well, now I'm
motivated and aroused.

08:33.916 --> 08:36.556
I want you to appreciate
the importance of

08:36.676 --> 08:38.197
our time together, Franky.
It's not just a box to be ticked.

08:38.275 --> 08:39.716
Nuh.

08:39.796 --> 08:41.476
Not just a game to be played.

08:43.796 --> 08:46.436
Don't think I'm
gonna go easy on you.

08:46.516 --> 08:48.317
Is that a threat?

08:48.436 --> 08:51.076
You really know how to push
a girl's buttons, don't you?

08:53.116 --> 08:54.636
See you tomorrow.

09:05.676 --> 09:08.317
Hey, Ms Westfall.
Liz, I told you, Bridget.

09:08.436 --> 09:10.317
Bridget, Bridget.
Look, I just wondered if you'd

09:10.356 --> 09:12.356
heard anything from Sophie.
No, not yet.

09:12.476 --> 09:14.356
Well, did you call her mobile?
Called her mobile and the other

09:14.476 --> 09:17.396
number that you gave me and you're
right, nobody's answering.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.676
Oh, well, did you call
from the prison line?

09:19.796 --> 09:22.396
No, I called from my phone.
I'll keep trying, OK?

09:22.516 --> 09:25.636
I'll let you know when I get
through, alright? Promise, alright?

09:25.716 --> 09:27.156
Thanks.

09:31.036 --> 09:33.197
It was a message so I'm
just gonna quickly make an...

09:33.317 --> 09:35.276
Hey! No!
Just back off!

09:39.516 --> 09:43.236
Kay. Kay, hi.
It's, uh, it's Liz Birdsworth here.

09:43.356 --> 09:46.756
Just wondering if I could
speak to Soph, please.

09:46.876 --> 09:50.956
Where is she? Cos I've been trying
her mobile and I just, you know, I

09:51.036 --> 09:52.796
think it's switched off.

09:52.876 --> 09:54.556
Kay?

09:54.676 --> 09:57.676
Is... Is something going on?
Cos when I spoke to Soph,

09:57.756 --> 09:59.276
she seemed really upset.

09:59.396 --> 10:04.716
Sorry, what? So, what do you
mean, it's my fault? I'm...

10:04.796 --> 10:07.197
I'm to blame for... What for?

10:07.317 --> 10:13.156
Kay, has something happened
to Soph? Kay? Kay!

10:16.276 --> 10:19.516
Now you can use the fuckin' phone!
Fuck.

10:19.596 --> 10:20.596
FUCK!

10:23.036 --> 10:25.716
I prefer to keep working, Governor.

10:25.836 --> 10:29.516
Yes, I'm sure you do, considering
the pressure you must be under.

10:29.636 --> 10:31.317
It might be in everyone's
best interests if you take

10:31.436 --> 10:33.836
some time off, just until
the matter's resolved.

10:33.956 --> 10:36.556
Well, I don't have
any holidays owing.

10:36.676 --> 10:38.876
No, I'm afraid it would
have to be unpaid leave.

10:38.996 --> 10:40.556
Well, you don't believe what
the police are saying, do you,

10:40.676 --> 10:42.436
Governor?
No, of course not.

10:42.556 --> 10:45.036
But given Bea Smith's association,
it won't be long before

10:45.156 --> 10:47.317
all the prisoners find
out what's going on.

10:47.436 --> 10:49.436
It's bound to undermine
your position of authority.

10:49.516 --> 10:52.436
Well, I'll deal with
any insubordination.

10:52.556 --> 10:54.076
I'd prefer not to
take leave, Governor.

10:55.836 --> 10:57.716
Your decision.

11:00.556 --> 11:01.996
G'day, Rob.
Hey, Liz.

11:06.956 --> 11:09.236
Excuse me, Governor,
can I speak to you, please?

11:09.317 --> 11:10.756
It's urgent.

11:10.916 --> 11:13.516
What is it? I need to get in
contact with my daughter.

11:13.596 --> 11:15.236
Is she on your call list?

11:15.356 --> 11:17.156
Yeah, but she's not
answering her phone.

11:17.276 --> 11:18.916
Well, perhaps she doesn't
wish to speak with you.

11:18.996 --> 11:20.596
No, no, no, I think something

11:20.716 --> 11:22.556
bad has happened and I need
permission to call hospitals...

11:22.676 --> 11:25.356
Birdsworth,
you know that's not how it's done.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.676
Yeah, I know, but I just need
help to track her down, Governor.

11:27.796 --> 11:30.116
We are under no obligation
to track down family members

11:30.236 --> 11:32.036
on the outside.
No, but this is an emergency.

11:32.156 --> 11:33.076
Well, have you tried
your ex-husband, Liz?

11:33.197 --> 11:35.596
Yes, I have and they are
deliberately shutting me out.

11:35.716 --> 11:39.636
Well, then, it is out of your hands
and it's out of ours, too.

11:39.716 --> 11:41.116
Oh, god, you don't understand.

11:41.236 --> 11:45.756
I understand perfectly.
I need to speak to my daughter!

11:45.876 --> 11:48.516
You will not raise your
voice to me, Birdsworth.

11:48.636 --> 11:51.676
Oh, I will do more than
raise my friggin' voice.

11:51.796 --> 11:53.876
I will tear this
bloody fence down...

11:53.996 --> 11:56.876
Release the fence and back away.
..get in touch with Sophie.

11:56.996 --> 11:58.596
I just...
Release the fence...

11:58.716 --> 12:00.116
It's a reasonable thing to ask.
..and walk away.

12:00.236 --> 12:02.317
Hey, hey, hey.
I just want to speak to Sophie, OK?

12:02.436 --> 12:03.436
Come on.
Cos I can't...

12:03.556 --> 12:05.716
Don't you dare touch me. I just
want to get in touch with her!

12:05.796 --> 12:08.116
I just want to speak to Sophie!

12:08.236 --> 12:11.716
It's OK, it's OK, Liz.
Let go of me, mate. Get off.

12:11.836 --> 12:15.556
Can't I just call her? I just want
to speak to my daughter, please.

12:15.676 --> 12:17.796
You're supposed to be
keeping an eye on her, Boomer.

12:35.317 --> 12:37.396
Liz, I'm gonna leave you
a couple of these pills just

12:37.436 --> 12:39.156
to help you relax, OK?

12:39.796 --> 12:42.116
Thanks.
That's alright.

12:54.476 --> 12:56.716
Oh, fuck.

13:10.996 --> 13:16.116
Birdie, get up. Let's go, Birdie.

13:16.236 --> 13:17.476
Wake up.
What?

13:19.356 --> 13:20.676
What?

13:20.756 --> 13:22.156
Come on, let's go.

13:42.636 --> 13:45.756
She won't let
the officers process her.

13:45.836 --> 13:47.556
And now she's refusing to cooperate

13:47.676 --> 13:50.276
with the strip search.
Sorry?

13:52.436 --> 13:54.317
Birdsworth, I need
you to help me calm her down.

14:06.116 --> 14:07.996
Mum.

14:27.026 --> 14:30.884
Soph, what happened, darl?

14:31.077 --> 14:33.408
I hit him.

14:35.854 --> 14:38.024
Hit? Hit who?

14:38.104 --> 14:42.244
Um, a man.

14:42.419 --> 14:45.032
On the bike.

14:45.112 --> 14:48.046
With Dad's car.

14:48.126 --> 14:50.859
A cyclist?

14:50.939 --> 14:52.668
He's dead.

14:53.592 --> 14:58.093
You... You shouldn't be in here.

14:58.214 --> 15:00.103
Why have they...
Why have you been remanded?

15:00.223 --> 15:03.197
Didn't they give you bail?
That's not...

15:03.277 --> 15:05.287
That's not right. That's not right.

15:05.367 --> 15:07.216
Cos you're just a baby.

15:07.337 --> 15:12.039
I didn't stop. I was...
I was over the limit.

15:12.199 --> 15:16.379
Oh, no. Oh, god.

15:22.608 --> 15:23.654
It's my fault...

15:23.734 --> 15:25.543
Don't touch me!

15:31.209 --> 15:33.620
Alright, let's go.

15:37.398 --> 15:39.568
Just keep walking
straight, Soph.

15:39.648 --> 15:42.462
Don't worry about it. You're right.

16:01.632 --> 16:04.204
At least I'll get
some fuckin' sleep.

16:05.490 --> 16:07.781
Then again, I don't mind sharing.

16:07.862 --> 16:09.629
Yeah, move it, Gambaro.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.599
There's a cell in H3
waiting for you.

16:15.618 --> 16:18.350
I've put you in a cell next
to your mother, Donaldson.

16:18.431 --> 16:19.798
I appreciate that, Ms Bennett.

16:19.919 --> 16:20.924
Well, the decision
was a pragmatic one.

16:21.043 --> 16:24.620
Hopefully, she'll settle in more
quickly and with less disruption.

16:26.268 --> 16:28.157
OK, come on.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.488
You're right.

16:30.568 --> 16:32.457
It's that one there. There we go.

16:41.178 --> 16:43.227
Well, I'll leave you to
conduct the orientation.

16:43.308 --> 16:44.956
Thanks.

16:51.908 --> 16:56.329
Well, it needs a couple of posters.
Liz? Hey.

16:56.450 --> 16:58.057
Hey.
Hi.

16:58.138 --> 16:59.826
Oh, Ms Miles, she come and told us.

16:59.946 --> 17:02.599
Yeah, thought we'd come
and see if you need anything.

17:02.719 --> 17:06.898
Oh, well, that's very
thoughtful of Ms Miles, isn't it?

17:06.980 --> 17:09.873
Um, this is Sophie.

17:09.993 --> 17:13.049
This is one of my best
mates in the whole world.

17:13.167 --> 17:15.097
Hey.
Doreen.

17:15.218 --> 17:17.790
Yep, she's
got a little bundle there.

17:17.911 --> 17:20.844
And this is Bea.
Hey.

17:20.964 --> 17:24.583
And Bea's what you call a top dog,
Soph, and that means

17:24.702 --> 17:28.279
you got nothing to worry about,
cos she'll protect ya.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.972
Isn't that right?
Yeah, course.

17:31.052 --> 17:33.182
Protect me? From what?

17:33.303 --> 17:35.473
Oh, no,
love, it's not like that, no.

17:35.595 --> 17:37.644
It's all... it's all very
nice in here.

17:37.764 --> 17:39.733
Oh, yeah, yeah,
everyone's real friendly.

17:39.855 --> 17:41.582
Oh, look, here's Maxine.
Maxi, come and say hi to Soph.

17:41.702 --> 17:47.007
Hi, Sophie, welcome. Hi. Your mum
has talked about you so much.

17:47.088 --> 17:49.942
Attention compound.

17:50.062 --> 17:52.352
Final count will commence in
two minutes.

17:53.799 --> 17:56.252
Right, we should get going.

17:56.371 --> 18:01.315
It's really nice
to meet you, Sophie.

18:01.395 --> 18:04.409
By your doors, ladies.

18:04.531 --> 18:10.397
So, um, you've gotta be standing by
your door for the head count.

18:10.519 --> 18:14.215
Um, don't borrow anyone
else's stuff without asking,

18:14.337 --> 18:19.561
except for mine. You can take
whatever you want of mine.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.650
And, um, what else?

18:21.731 --> 18:23.821
What else? Oh, yeah, the, uh,

18:23.901 --> 18:25.950
the panic button there.

18:26.031 --> 18:28.363
Don't ever push it.

18:28.482 --> 18:31.979
We can talk more
when they lock the gate.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.556
Wanna maybe watch telly or something.
I just want to be left alone.

18:35.637 --> 18:38.129
Birdsworth, move it.

18:38.248 --> 18:42.106
OK, yeah, sure.
You've gotta stand...

19:16.026 --> 19:19.201
No, just leave me the fuck alone!

19:23.382 --> 19:25.391
Sorry.
It's OK.

19:25.470 --> 19:26.475
Sorry.

19:27.761 --> 19:30.415
What the fuck did The Freak
do to you in the slot?

19:31.619 --> 19:35.839
Nothing. She didn't
do anything to me.

19:35.920 --> 19:38.009
Bullshit.

19:41.023 --> 19:43.676
You fucked me over.
No, baby, I didn't.

19:43.797 --> 19:45.968
Don't lie to me.
I'm not.

19:46.047 --> 19:47.936
I can't tell you.

19:49.343 --> 19:51.071
I can't.

19:54.165 --> 19:55.733
It was Red, wasn't it?

20:21.855 --> 20:23.946
Soph.

20:27.361 --> 20:30.134
Mum.
Oh, darling.

20:30.255 --> 20:33.190
Mum.
Shove up, darling. Shove up.

20:33.269 --> 20:36.003
Come on. Come on, darling.

20:37.931 --> 20:42.392
It's alright. It's alright, lovey.
It's alright.

21:00.397 --> 21:01.522
Can I help you?

21:01.643 --> 21:04.978
Looks like I'm not the only groupie
magnet in the big panty palace.

21:05.059 --> 21:07.791
"Righteous act of retribution."

21:07.873 --> 21:10.002
She's a wild one.

21:12.494 --> 21:13.901
What the fuck do you want?

21:13.981 --> 21:15.187
You set Jodie up to get to me.

21:15.267 --> 21:16.393
What, did she tell you that?

21:16.433 --> 21:18.120
It's really fucked up.

21:18.241 --> 21:19.648
Why use Jodie?
Why not just burn me?

21:19.768 --> 21:22.662
Jodie obviously didn't
cope so well in the slot.

21:22.782 --> 21:25.033
Does she even know what day it is?
You fuckin' don't know the half of

21:25.153 --> 21:26.037
it.
What's going on?

21:26.158 --> 21:30.137
Relax, Maxi Pad.
You'll give yourself a prolapse.

21:30.218 --> 21:32.268
Excuse me.

21:32.347 --> 21:35.724
Jodie's gonna get it.

21:35.843 --> 21:38.657
Oh, Bea, just let it go.
No.

21:38.778 --> 21:41.148
That little snitch needs
to be taught a lesson.

21:43.118 --> 21:45.207
She's not scheduled.

21:45.329 --> 21:48.664
I'm scheduling her now.
I don't even have the paperwork

21:48.785 --> 21:51.317
for it.
I'll write it up.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.331
OK, fine. Jodie, you're

21:54.451 --> 21:57.104
to be subject to a urine test.
Are you up to giving me a sample?

21:57.224 --> 22:00.439
Yep.
OK.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.892
Take this.

22:02.971 --> 22:04.498
Just walk this way with me.

22:09.121 --> 22:11.612
Oh.

22:11.693 --> 22:14.466
Oh, for God's sake, Spiteri.

22:14.545 --> 22:16.032
If you think you can dodge this

22:16.154 --> 22:19.006
test, think again.
What's Spiteri doing here?

22:19.127 --> 22:21.056
She's failing to
comply with a drug test.

22:21.178 --> 22:23.628
I don't recall any
testing on the schedule.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.642
It's a spot test, Governor.
I judged Spiteri's demeanour

22:26.724 --> 22:29.656
to be erratic and withdrawn.

22:29.778 --> 22:31.787
The prisoner has just
spent two weeks in isolation.

22:31.907 --> 22:36.127
You don't think that might explain
her withdrawn behaviour? Smith.

22:36.207 --> 22:38.539
Take Spiteri back to your Unit.

22:38.619 --> 22:40.427
Now.

22:40.549 --> 22:43.160
Get her cleaned up.
Yes, Governor.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.169
Hi, Jodie.

22:45.250 --> 22:47.741
Let's get you cleaned up, huh?

22:47.863 --> 22:51.319
I suggest we don't waste time with
any extraneous testing, agreed?

22:51.399 --> 22:53.488
Yes, Governor.

22:55.016 --> 22:57.949
Organise a prisoner to do that.

22:58.030 --> 23:00.200
Oh, it's OK. I'm nearly finished.

23:04.098 --> 23:06.149
Fuck!

23:15.633 --> 23:17.803
You gonna help me?

23:17.883 --> 23:19.049
Yeah, yeah.

23:19.129 --> 23:22.024
We'll give you a hand.

23:22.143 --> 23:24.434
After you tell us about that
conversation you had with Franky.

23:24.555 --> 23:28.253
No, but you said you
were taking a cut.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.945
And then
Maxine takes the fucking lot.

23:31.066 --> 23:36.331
And then she plants the shit
in my cell. You know I'm

23:36.410 --> 23:39.023
gonna do more time for that.

23:42.921 --> 23:46.176
I should knock your fucking
head off, you little snitch.

23:51.402 --> 23:53.089
I fuckin' hate her.

23:53.170 --> 23:55.781
I wanna kill the bitch.

23:55.903 --> 23:58.796
Is that honest enough for you?
I won't put that down in my report.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.524
Cos you think it'll
prejudice the parole board?

24:00.645 --> 24:03.177
Maybe.

24:03.297 --> 24:05.788
You may joke, Franky, but
I've heard all the stories.

24:05.869 --> 24:09.807
You know Smith played you.

24:09.928 --> 24:13.103
It's not like you had any
choice giving up power to her.

24:13.183 --> 24:14.831
So how's that make you feel?

24:18.086 --> 24:23.230
Come on. Isn't there that
small part of you that's just

24:23.312 --> 24:25.321
a teensy bit pissed off?

24:27.852 --> 24:30.384
Come on, these walls won't talk.

24:30.505 --> 24:34.483
You can tell me anything. I want
to get inside that mind of yours.

24:38.502 --> 24:40.472
Just my mind?

24:47.144 --> 24:50.599
You know how exhausting
it is, being top dog?

24:50.720 --> 24:53.332
Why don't you tell me?
You never know who wants to fuck

24:53.454 --> 24:55.864
you or fight you.
That just sounds

24:55.945 --> 24:57.472
confusing rather than tiring.

24:57.592 --> 25:01.129
It's all about tit for tat, "I
can crap bigger than you" bullshit.

25:01.250 --> 25:04.826
Trying to feed the hop heads, work
the screws, fuck off The Freak.

25:04.948 --> 25:07.599
It takes up too much head space.
Makes you fucking mental.

25:07.679 --> 25:10.332
Have you seen Queen Bea lately?

25:10.453 --> 25:13.708
I swear she's a fuckin' red cunt's
hair away from going postal.

25:15.597 --> 25:18.331
Look, Gidget, I get
what you're trying to do.

25:18.450 --> 25:22.550
Understand you.
No, poke me. See if I bite.

25:24.037 --> 25:27.614
But I got more important things to
worry about than Bea fuckin' Smith.

25:27.734 --> 25:33.280
Like what?
Like getting out of this shithouse.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.731
Parole's my total focus.
Scout's honour, Doc.

25:35.812 --> 25:38.545
I'm a psychologist.

25:38.666 --> 25:42.282
And I'm a reformed individual
with just one thing on my mind.

25:42.363 --> 25:44.573
And it's not payback.

25:52.048 --> 25:54.219
You wanted to see me, Governor?

25:54.299 --> 25:57.032
Come in. Close the door. Sit down.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.971
Nurse Atkins, how are you coping?

26:01.050 --> 26:04.386
Uh, fine. Good. Yes.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.114
I love the job.

26:06.236 --> 26:11.218
It must be very difficult for you,
this situation with Mr Jackson.

26:11.339 --> 26:13.509
You know, as governor,
I want to be sure that

26:13.590 --> 26:15.880
you don't become a victim here.

26:15.961 --> 26:17.648
A victim of what?

26:17.729 --> 26:19.417
Ridicule.

26:19.497 --> 26:21.788
Innuendo.

26:21.909 --> 26:24.642
From the prisoners.
You know, because of your

26:24.722 --> 26:26.048
association with Officer Jackson.

26:26.169 --> 26:29.504
Oh, I'm sure the prisoners aren't
aware of our association...

26:29.626 --> 26:31.635
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they are. I mean, to

26:31.755 --> 26:34.849
be honest, I'm a little surprised
you haven't been targeted already,

26:34.970 --> 26:38.989
considering Mr Jackson's rumoured
relationship with Bea Smith.

26:39.069 --> 26:40.919
That rumour was unfounded...

26:41.038 --> 26:44.697
Of course there's this
unfortunate matter with the police.

26:44.816 --> 26:47.147
You know,
given that most prisoners claim

26:47.268 --> 26:48.716
innocence, I'm not
so sure the women here

26:48.835 --> 26:50.362
will be convinced of his.
Will isn't capable of

26:50.484 --> 26:54.582
hurting anyone.
No, of course not.

26:54.703 --> 26:57.074
Although I suspect Mr Fletcher might
have something to say about that.

26:57.194 --> 27:03.304
Will and Fletch have
sorted out their differences.

27:03.424 --> 27:05.192
Have they?
Yeah.

27:05.314 --> 27:09.975
Will's visited Fletch in rehab
and they had a good chat.

27:10.056 --> 27:11.824
Cleared the air about everything.

27:17.370 --> 27:22.795
Shit. Oh, shit, shit.

27:29.868 --> 27:30.873
Mr Fletcher?

27:33.726 --> 27:35.696
Joan Ferguson.

27:37.625 --> 27:39.915
White with one.

27:48.276 --> 27:51.329
It's good to see you've got
some people around you.

27:52.454 --> 27:55.911
I don't imagine you've had
much opportunity for socialising.

27:57.438 --> 28:01.899
You don't like me.
Why do you say that?

28:01.979 --> 28:03.747
I remember.

28:05.275 --> 28:06.963
We didn't get on.

28:08.289 --> 28:12.790
It's true, we had a mild
personality clash.

28:12.910 --> 28:16.368
You had some problems
with women in authority.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.659
But I don't hold grudges.
The past is the past.

28:18.738 --> 28:20.587
All I care about now, Mr Fletcher,

28:20.707 --> 28:25.329
is for you to drink your
coffee before it gets cold.

28:33.326 --> 28:34.653
I hear you had
a visitor recently.

28:37.266 --> 28:38.271
A work colleague.

28:40.922 --> 28:44.781
Vera.
I'm speaking of Mr Jackson.

28:44.861 --> 28:47.352
Vera comes to visit me.

29:08.532 --> 29:11.466
What are you doing, Liz? Get on her!

29:14.319 --> 29:16.530
Hey! Yo!

29:16.651 --> 29:19.624
Here, here, Franky!
Franky! Franky!

29:23.162 --> 29:25.371
Hey, gorgeous.

29:26.778 --> 29:29.994
Why don't you come and join
the game? Play with my boys.

29:30.073 --> 29:32.123
Oi, give us the ball back.

29:32.245 --> 29:34.173
She doesn't play
for your team, Juice.

29:34.293 --> 29:36.383
How does she know what team she
plays for until she gives it a go?

29:36.584 --> 29:39.278
The girl's out
of bounds, alright, Juice?

29:39.397 --> 29:40.482
Now just take your
hard-on somewhere else

29:40.603 --> 29:42.051
and throw the ball
back in the game.

29:42.170 --> 29:43.657
Yeah, whatever, Bea. Only trying to
make friends with the cherry.

29:43.779 --> 29:44.903
Just play the game.
We're waiting, come on.

29:45.025 --> 29:46.953
It's alright, love.
She's just harmless.

29:47.074 --> 29:50.891
Yeah, come on, play the game.
Alright, let's go.

29:50.972 --> 29:52.217
Thanks, Bea.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.799
Maxine, who's winning?

29:56.880 --> 30:00.416
We are. Hey, hello.
How'd the obstetrician go?

30:00.496 --> 30:01.663
Oh, yeah, really good.

30:01.782 --> 30:03.832
Everything's as it should be,
and sorted out a birth plan, eh?

30:03.953 --> 30:07.169
Oh, Dor, I'm really bloody sorry.
I completely forgot, love.

30:07.288 --> 30:09.298
Oh, that's alright. You know,
you've got a lot on your mind.

30:09.419 --> 30:12.393
But it's OK cos Jess came with me.
How'd you go?

30:12.553 --> 30:15.407
Well, we heard the baby's heartbeat,
and it was so amazing. Was it?

30:15.527 --> 30:16.773
Uh-huh!
Concentrate!

30:20.028 --> 30:22.600
That was a fuckin' foul!
Bull-fucking-shit!

30:22.681 --> 30:24.288
Give her the ball, ya skank.

30:24.369 --> 30:25.695
You've got two balls, Juice.

30:25.815 --> 30:26.820
Why don't you
give her one of your own?

30:26.941 --> 30:30.800
Oh, go finger yourself, Franky.
Or maybe ya want me to do it for ya.

30:30.919 --> 30:35.139
Just play the game!
Oh, cut it out, guys.

30:35.261 --> 30:41.168
Oi, break it up! Break it up,
I said! Break it up! Get down!

30:42.413 --> 30:46.191
You right?
Fuck. Yeah, I'm alright, thanks.

30:46.313 --> 30:50.372
Now!
Oh, sorry, Red.

31:01.704 --> 31:04.357
Hey, hey, no, Bea,
you're bleeding, love.

31:12.314 --> 31:14.524
She's been shivved.

31:14.645 --> 31:21.036
Up against the wall.
Smith, let's go. Smith, now.

31:21.115 --> 31:22.282
What the fuck?

31:23.888 --> 31:25.738
Up against the wall.

31:44.688 --> 31:47.456
Hey, how's the patient?

31:47.537 --> 31:49.343
A dozen stitches.

31:49.376 --> 31:52.266
The doctor said she's lucky
the angle of the blade resulted in

31:52.282 --> 31:54.570
a laceration and not
a puncture wound.

31:54.595 --> 31:56.280
It could have cost her a kidney.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.085
You want to give us a minute?

32:00.652 --> 32:03.984
OK. Yeah, sure.
Can I have some pain relief, please?

32:04.064 --> 32:05.990
I'll organise something.

32:07.031 --> 32:09.480
So, any point asking who did it?

32:17.986 --> 32:21.716
My DNA wasn't a match.
It puts me in the clear.

32:26.290 --> 32:28.337
That's good.

32:37.403 --> 32:42.137
Thanks.
Thank you.

32:42.257 --> 32:44.906
No, no, you need to stay here
for another couple of hours for

32:44.985 --> 32:47.113
observation, OK?

32:57.785 --> 32:59.590
It's amazing, isn't it?

33:01.878 --> 33:06.491
You think you command total loyalty

33:06.572 --> 33:08.457
and then a knife in the back

33:08.576 --> 33:12.430
reminds us we're not as
invulnerable as we think.

33:17.082 --> 33:20.693
Shit happens.
Frequently.

33:20.813 --> 33:23.621
But if this really is your prison,
then shouldn't that shit be

33:23.703 --> 33:27.152
happening to somebody else?

33:29.881 --> 33:33.452
You know, using a riot
to exercise power.

33:35.296 --> 33:39.309
You know, if you rule through
chaos, you reap what you sow.

33:40.954 --> 33:47.012
Real leadership, Smith, takes
control, detachment and planning.

33:48.135 --> 33:53.110
It's knowing when to act and when
to let others take action for you.

34:24.565 --> 34:26.290
Where is it?

34:26.371 --> 34:28.056
What?

34:28.176 --> 34:30.262
Ow!
The shiv.

34:30.382 --> 34:32.991
It wasn't me, I swear!
Where have you hidden it?

34:33.112 --> 34:34.636
Maxine, it's alright.
Fuck!

34:34.755 --> 34:36.120
Hey!
Fuck!

34:37.524 --> 34:39.409
Hey, Jodie, when
you pissed yourself,

34:39.531 --> 34:42.058
you weren't
trying to dodge the drug test.

34:42.138 --> 34:43.782
You were scared shitless.

34:43.862 --> 34:45.989
I'm not angry.

34:46.110 --> 34:49.922
I'm not. I just want you to
tell me the truth, alright?

34:50.643 --> 34:53.210
I think Ferguson got
to you in the slot.

34:54.735 --> 34:58.266
Did she give you the shiv, too? Yeah?

34:58.387 --> 35:02.038
Give you a little bit of gear,
maybe? She did, didn't she?

35:02.118 --> 35:03.924
She got you high, and she told you

35:04.044 --> 35:07.374
to come at me, didn't she, Jodie?
It's alright, you can tell me.

35:07.454 --> 35:10.464
Didn't she? Just say it.

35:10.583 --> 35:12.831
Did she?
Alright!

35:12.910 --> 35:14.475
I didn't have a choice!

35:16.080 --> 35:17.604
What else could I do?

35:22.781 --> 35:24.706
The fuckin' Freak made me do it.

35:28.999 --> 35:33.813
It was in the exercise yard.
Dropped in one of the drains.

35:33.894 --> 35:36.221
Good work.

35:37.705 --> 35:39.871
About today.

35:39.950 --> 35:41.477
The drug testing of Jodie Spiteri...

35:41.596 --> 35:43.603
You don't need to explain
your actions to me, Vera.

35:43.683 --> 35:45.569
No, I just feel like...

35:45.688 --> 35:49.500
You know, you are a fine deputy
governor, Vera. It's just that

35:49.621 --> 35:51.787
your judgement can be
a little wayward at times.

35:53.111 --> 35:57.725
I mean, take your visits
to Mr Fletcher, for instance.

35:57.846 --> 36:03.903
It's not that you've been going to
see him in rehab that disturbs me.

36:04.023 --> 36:07.353
It's that you felt you
could explicitly lie about it.

36:11.525 --> 36:13.532
I'm sorry.
What, you're sorry because you knew

36:13.652 --> 36:16.381
it would be seen as a betrayal?
That you were compromising your

36:16.502 --> 36:18.748
loyalty to me and to this
prison by associating with him?

36:18.788 --> 36:20.754
I didn't want to hurt your feelings.

36:25.288 --> 36:29.861
That is so considerate of you.

36:31.305 --> 36:33.994
There will be no further
need to see Mr Fletcher.

36:35.077 --> 36:37.725
He's no longer a colleague
and, given what he's put us both

36:37.845 --> 36:39.651
through, we can hardly
call him a friend, hmm?

36:41.456 --> 36:48.036
Though I must ask, Vera, just in
light of this deliberate deception,

36:48.116 --> 36:51.968
just where does your loyalty lie?

36:54.575 --> 36:56.581
With you, Governor.
I'm so sorry, I didn't hear that.

36:56.661 --> 36:59.309
With you, Governor.

37:01.436 --> 37:04.244
Always with you.

37:08.979 --> 37:10.905
Incinerate that.

37:12.509 --> 37:13.633
Yes, Governor.

37:22.860 --> 37:25.266
Thought you ran the kitchen.

37:25.388 --> 37:29.601
I like to mop shit, too.
Helps me keep it real.

37:30.281 --> 37:34.094
I hear Bea Smith's in medical
after being shivved in the yard.

37:35.980 --> 37:40.393
What's your point?
No point, just saying...

37:40.513 --> 37:43.522
Are you fuckin' serious?
You ask me for honesty,

37:43.643 --> 37:45.930
which I gave you, and then
you accuse me of that shit?

37:46.049 --> 37:48.217
No, I'm not accusing you.
Bullshit you aren't.

37:48.336 --> 37:50.142
Alright, I was worried
about you, that's all.

37:50.262 --> 37:51.787
Worried? That I
went and shivved Bea?

37:51.867 --> 37:53.432
No, that I'd pushed you too far...

37:53.553 --> 37:55.278
You need to stay
the fuck away from me.

37:55.356 --> 38:01.095
OK. Sorry.

38:03.141 --> 38:05.187
You can stick your
sorry up your arse.

38:16.943 --> 38:21.476
OK, so, I got you some toiletries,
but if you want anything fancier,

38:21.597 --> 38:23.041
you just have to wait
for the screws,

38:23.121 --> 38:26.410
cos they have a special spend
once a month.

38:26.531 --> 38:29.822
Uh, can I...?
What, love?

38:31.064 --> 38:34.675
Shower in my underwear?
Yeah, course you can.

38:34.796 --> 38:39.489
I used to do that when
I was a newbie.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.456
Oh, looky here, boys.

38:41.576 --> 38:44.866
Bath time's gonna
be fun for a change.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.471
Uh, no, we've just finished.

38:46.592 --> 38:50.924
That's weird. No steam.
Unless you both took a cold shower.

38:51.003 --> 38:53.010
Hardens the nips, eh?

38:53.131 --> 38:57.103
No. We'll come back later.
That's fine. No! No!

38:59.470 --> 39:03.241
Please don't hurt me.
I'm not gonna hurt ya, Soph.

39:03.321 --> 39:05.127
I'm all about pleasure.

39:05.207 --> 39:07.013
You bitch!

39:07.133 --> 39:09.299
You touch her, I swear
to God I'll kill you!

39:09.420 --> 39:13.151
I bet you taste tickety-boo.
Get off me!

39:13.231 --> 39:16.200
Like a strawberry milkshake.

39:16.321 --> 39:21.697
If Bea hears about this, mate,
she's gonna get you! Ah!

39:21.777 --> 39:24.103
Something you should know.

39:24.185 --> 39:26.029
We've all got a touch of the hep C.

39:26.150 --> 39:30.604
But don't you worry, baby doll.
You can only catch it once.

39:36.060 --> 39:37.303
Juice?

40:05.187 --> 40:08.036
You want some more,
ya sick fuck bull dyke bitch?

40:15.658 --> 40:18.587
Ah! Ah, fuck!
Alright, love. They're gone now.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.593
They're gone now, lovey.

40:29.972 --> 40:33.142
â™ª Oh, baby, I wanna get witcha
and take your picture â™ª

40:38.197 --> 40:39.641
Lizzie.

40:39.721 --> 40:41.487
What's goin' on?

40:41.607 --> 40:44.858
I just wanted to say thank you,
for what you did earlier today.

40:44.937 --> 40:46.141
Yeah, sweet.

40:46.261 --> 40:48.548
Kinda busy.
Oh, right.

40:48.628 --> 40:50.113
Right, well, talk to you later.

40:50.193 --> 40:52.359
Is that my mum, Franky?

40:52.440 --> 40:55.329
Yeah, she's just leaving, but.

40:58.659 --> 41:04.476
Mum! Mum. Have a drink! Franky
and me are having a partay!

41:04.556 --> 41:05.880
Oh, no, come on, Soph.

41:07.204 --> 41:10.092
I said, come on. Give me that.

41:10.173 --> 41:11.777
No, come on.

41:11.897 --> 41:13.945
We've got head count in ten minutes.
But we're having a party.

41:14.065 --> 41:16.833
No, you're in prison now, love.
Party's over.

41:18.639 --> 41:20.243
Fuck you.

41:20.324 --> 41:22.329
Go.

41:22.409 --> 41:23.774
Quick.

41:47.967 --> 41:52.098
Am I going to have to tell a few
jokes to get a smile tonight?

41:53.784 --> 41:59.119
I'm terrible at telling jokes, OK?

41:59.240 --> 42:06.140
Will, I... just this whole
police thing. I just... I mean,

42:08.267 --> 42:11.075
why they think
you killed Harry Smith.

42:11.196 --> 42:16.089
It's because of Bea, isn't it?
What do you mean?

42:16.211 --> 42:19.341
You guys have a connection.
I've seen it.

42:19.461 --> 42:21.346
I thought we'd been through that.
No, I'm not accusing you...

42:21.467 --> 42:23.594
Well, what, then?
Police don't break

42:23.673 --> 42:26.241
down people's doors for no reason.

42:26.322 --> 42:28.207
What were they looking for?

42:30.333 --> 42:33.864
Tell me.
A murder weapon.

42:34.426 --> 42:37.996
Oh, my god.
Have you spoken to a lawyer?

42:38.077 --> 42:39.601
It's bullshit, Rose.

42:39.722 --> 42:42.129
No, you need to take
this seriously, Will.

42:48.067 --> 42:51.356
OK. Um, alright, you know what?

42:51.477 --> 42:56.051
I'm just going to go.
Rose, come on, please?

42:56.171 --> 42:59.541
Look, maybe I'm overreacting.
Or maybe not.

42:59.621 --> 43:01.225
I'm tired.

43:01.346 --> 43:02.991
My shifts have been all
over the shop, so I'm just...

43:03.112 --> 43:07.043
Rose, can we just...
Can we just talk about this, please?

43:07.124 --> 43:08.889
I just need some rest, OK?

43:08.969 --> 43:10.735
I'll see you tomorrow.

43:17.595 --> 43:21.246
To other news now, and notorious
convicted murdered Bea Smith has

43:21.367 --> 43:24.095
been linked to the kidnapping
and vicious bashing of a

43:24.215 --> 43:27.986
Brunswick man who was recently
convicted of assaulting his wife.

43:28.066 --> 43:29.270
Bea?

43:29.391 --> 43:32.360
A warning, some viewers may find
the following footage disturbing.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.884
The video of the attack,

43:34.004 --> 43:36.732
posted on the internet, shows
a group of masked assailants...

43:36.813 --> 43:38.378
Ohh! Look at 'em going bunta.

43:38.497 --> 43:41.025
..punching and kicking the man, who
was given a controversial suspended

43:41.106 --> 43:43.714
sentence on his assault conviction.

43:43.834 --> 43:46.803
At the end of the video,
one of the attackers, who appears

43:46.923 --> 43:50.574
to be a woman, gives a statement in
which she claims to be representing

43:50.695 --> 43:55.909
an anonymous group of vigilantes
calling itself The Red Right Hand.

43:55.991 --> 43:57.676
We are The Red Right Hand,

43:57.795 --> 44:00.965
and we're taking a stand
on violence against women

44:01.046 --> 44:04.415
in the name of our hero, Bea Smith.

44:04.536 --> 44:09.470
If you perpetrate these atrocities
and the law fails to punish you,

44:09.591 --> 44:12.159
we will be the true arbiters
of justice.

44:12.239 --> 44:13.563
We are The Red Right Hand.

44:13.683 --> 44:18.057
Beware our righteous acts
of retribution.
