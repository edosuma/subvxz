00:28.241 --> 00:29.827
Did August happen to tell you

00:29.931 --> 00:31.482
about our epic game of chess?

00:31.586 --> 00:32.724
No. Let me guess,

00:32.827 --> 00:34.000
you wiped the board with him.

00:34.103 --> 00:35.758
Aw, not true. He held his own.

00:35.862 --> 00:37.931
- Ah, thanks, Mawline.
- I'm gonna teach you first,

00:38.034 --> 00:39.379
and then I'm gonna destroy you.

00:39.482 --> 00:42.689
Okay, I've-I've been...
I've been studying,

00:42.793 --> 00:44.241
- you know?
- Studying?

00:44.344 --> 00:46.137
I don't really think
downloading an app overnight

00:46.241 --> 00:47.482
really counts as studying.

00:47.586 --> 00:49.896
Tread lightly.
Your chess playing skills

00:50.000 --> 00:51.482
are only slightly

00:51.586 --> 00:52.793
more advanced
than your whittling.

00:52.896 --> 00:53.896
Okay, stop that.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.275
It is beautiful.

00:55.379 --> 00:58.034
No, you're right. I know.

00:58.137 --> 00:59.379
It's the thought.

00:59.482 --> 01:01.586
- Thank you, Augie.
- Hey, Liam,

01:01.689 --> 01:02.965
stop it right there.

01:03.068 --> 01:04.413
- What'd I do?
- Well, you're about to come

01:04.517 --> 01:06.068
to my breakfast table
with a pile of work.

01:07.655 --> 01:09.482
I'm gonna need
an exception to that

01:09.586 --> 01:11.034
"no work at the table" rule,
Mama.

01:11.137 --> 01:13.689
What's so important
it can't wait for 20 minutes?

01:13.793 --> 01:14.965
Uh, it's just work stuff.

01:15.068 --> 01:16.310
Oh, for crying out loud,

01:16.413 --> 01:17.931
you can say
that it's the horse rescue

01:18.034 --> 01:19.724
charity thing that you set up
over at the Davidson's.

01:19.827 --> 01:21.068
Now, I may not be thrilled

01:21.172 --> 01:22.344
that you did it
without my consent,

01:22.448 --> 01:24.655
- but... what's done is done.
- Okay,

01:24.758 --> 01:28.137
Daddy, I am sorry that
I didn't come to you first.

01:28.241 --> 01:30.413
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
You're right.

01:30.517 --> 01:32.413
But it's gonna be fine. Really.

01:32.517 --> 01:34.034
Okay? I'm meeting with
an accountant tomorrow

01:34.137 --> 01:37.034
that specializes in all of this
exact type of thing,

01:37.137 --> 01:39.103
so, just, there's no worries.

01:39.206 --> 01:42.172
- Right.
- Mm. Where's Cordell?

01:42.275 --> 01:44.965
I don't know.
I think he's got a work thing.

01:45.068 --> 01:46.689
- I'll text him.
- Okay,

01:46.793 --> 01:48.344
I didn't ask
for phones at the table.

01:48.448 --> 01:50.620
Work thing? It's Saturday,
for crying out loud.

01:50.724 --> 01:51.620
Oh,

01:51.724 --> 01:52.931
he's, uh, meeting with Julia

01:53.034 --> 01:54.793
- at the farmhouse.
- Julia, the reporter?

01:54.896 --> 01:56.655
She gonna write another story
about him or something?

01:56.758 --> 01:59.586
I don't know, he didn't say,
but I don't think so.

01:59.689 --> 02:02.482
It's probably just,
you know, work stuff.

02:02.586 --> 02:04.586
Yeah, well, there seems to be
a lot of that going around.

02:04.689 --> 02:05.827
Yes, there does.
You need to clear

02:05.931 --> 02:06.931
all of that off the table.

02:07.034 --> 02:08.413
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

02:08.517 --> 02:10.172
- Okay.
- Thank you.

02:12.034 --> 02:14.103
You know, I'll be right back.

02:21.068 --> 02:22.517
Hey.

02:22.620 --> 02:25.206
Just a quick word
before you disappear

02:25.310 --> 02:28.275
into that pile of paper.
Now, you know how much

02:28.379 --> 02:30.793
I've had on my plate lately.

02:30.896 --> 02:32.241
Your brother certainly does.

02:32.344 --> 02:33.758
We've had our own talk

02:33.862 --> 02:35.310
about that,

02:35.413 --> 02:36.758
which is something we need
to follow up on, but...

02:36.862 --> 02:38.172
About what?

02:38.275 --> 02:39.689
Nothing you need
to worry about right now,

02:39.793 --> 02:41.379
but I say all this,

02:41.482 --> 02:43.827
because I want to call together

02:43.931 --> 02:45.310
a family meeting this week.

02:45.413 --> 02:47.689
And no phones.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.275
None of this-this work stuff,
all right?

02:50.379 --> 02:52.068
Just family...

02:52.172 --> 02:53.827
sorting things out
like we used to.

02:53.931 --> 02:54.931
Just give me a time and place,

02:55.034 --> 02:56.034
and we'll be there, Daddy.

02:56.137 --> 02:57.137
Well, I'll figure that out.

02:57.241 --> 02:58.172
You just let your brother know.

02:58.275 --> 02:59.758
All right.

03:00.793 --> 03:02.172
So I take it

03:02.275 --> 03:04.310
- this is what you
wanted to run by me?
- Yeah.

03:04.413 --> 03:06.517
This is what I found

03:06.620 --> 03:07.793
sitting on my porch last night

03:07.896 --> 03:09.275
when we were
talking on the phone.

03:09.379 --> 03:10.551
Okay.

03:10.655 --> 03:12.517
- No return address.
- No, no stamp,

03:12.620 --> 03:13.586
no postmark, and nothing

03:13.689 --> 03:14.896
on the security cam footage.

03:15.000 --> 03:16.724
So, first question.

03:16.827 --> 03:18.000
How did it get here?

03:18.103 --> 03:20.758
Your guess is as good as mine.

03:20.862 --> 03:24.068
- Okay. Question two:
who sent it?
- I'd imagine

03:24.172 --> 03:26.413
our illustrious jailers,
don't you think?

03:26.517 --> 03:27.551
- I do.
- Yeah.

03:27.655 --> 03:29.034
So what's the message?

03:29.137 --> 03:30.896
I mean, other than
the importance of hydration.

03:33.241 --> 03:36.103
My opinion?
Um, it's classic psy-ops.

03:36.206 --> 03:37.724
I mean, think about it.

03:37.827 --> 03:39.448
They're coming after me,
you know, making it personal.

03:39.551 --> 03:41.482
Trying to-trying to scare me,
trying to break me down,

03:41.586 --> 03:43.827
just like they did in captivity.

03:47.206 --> 03:48.896
Okay, but

03:49.000 --> 03:50.241
for what purpose?

03:51.241 --> 03:53.000
Same as before.

03:53.103 --> 03:54.965
They want me to join...

03:55.896 --> 03:57.551
We could really use
a guy like you.

03:57.655 --> 04:00.517
...their little
anarchist sewing circle.

04:00.620 --> 04:02.000
They're called Grey Flag.

04:03.379 --> 04:04.379
How'd you know that name?

04:04.482 --> 04:05.793
No, no, no.

04:05.896 --> 04:08.413
Julia, that name
is highly classified.

04:08.517 --> 04:11.241
Ranger's eyes only.
You-you shouldn't even...

04:11.344 --> 04:12.931
I'm an investigative reporter.

04:13.034 --> 04:15.310
It's my job to know things
people aren't supposed to know.

04:15.413 --> 04:17.379
I've spent an entire career

04:17.482 --> 04:19.172
cultivating a list
of high-level sources.

04:19.275 --> 04:20.862
In government, in business,

04:20.965 --> 04:23.310
- and in intelligence
communities, in...
- Okay, okay,

04:23.413 --> 04:25.655
okay. Then-then
why don't you tell me

04:25.758 --> 04:26.758
something I shouldn't know.

04:26.862 --> 04:28.655
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

04:28.758 --> 04:30.413
I don't think you're gonna
like what I have to say.

04:32.586 --> 04:33.896
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
If I were you,
I wouldn't be so quick

04:36.103 --> 04:38.344
to drop this off
at the Ranger's crime lab.

04:40.551 --> 04:42.448
You're saying you think
there could still be moles

04:42.551 --> 04:44.206
inside the Rangers, like Fenton.

04:44.310 --> 04:46.137
I think it's extremely possible.

04:46.241 --> 04:48.551
Who told you that?

04:49.896 --> 04:52.344
Okay, okay, okay.

04:52.448 --> 04:54.000
If you can't tell me a name,

04:54.103 --> 04:56.034
how can I possibly believe you?

04:56.137 --> 04:57.862
One sec.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.827
It's Captain James.

04:59.931 --> 05:01.068
On a Saturday.

05:01.172 --> 05:02.482
That can't be good news.

05:02.586 --> 05:04.965
One sec. Captain.

05:10.344 --> 05:12.172
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

05:12.275 --> 05:14.724
Um, saw Walker's truck
parked out there, too.

05:14.827 --> 05:16.344
Guess we all got the call.

05:16.448 --> 05:18.068
Yeah. You have any idea

05:18.172 --> 05:20.206
why the big man
wants to see us on a Saturday?

05:20.310 --> 05:21.448
Uh...

05:21.551 --> 05:23.206
Well, maybe to congratulate us

05:23.310 --> 05:26.620
for preventing a deadly riot
at the credit union yesterday.

05:26.724 --> 05:27.758
Duh.

05:27.862 --> 05:29.206
Yeah, that's oddly

05:29.310 --> 05:30.482
optimistic of you.

05:30.586 --> 05:31.482
Eh, I have my moments.

05:31.586 --> 05:32.620
Yeah, you also have a date

05:32.724 --> 05:34.034
with Kev tonight, apparently,

05:34.137 --> 05:36.172
which, more than likely,
explains why you're so...

05:36.275 --> 05:37.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

05:37.620 --> 05:38.758
He told you already?

05:38.862 --> 05:39.965
He just asked me,
like, an hour ago.

05:40.068 --> 05:41.241
What, are we 14?

05:41.344 --> 05:43.206
What can I say,
the man's excited.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.758
He also said that

05:44.862 --> 05:46.896
your lunch was a little awkward,
and he wants a mulligan.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.689
Oh, I can't with these
sports metaphors.

05:51.206 --> 05:53.000
Hey, good morning, partner.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.517
What's wrong?

05:58.000 --> 05:59.034
Oh, it's nice of you

05:59.137 --> 06:00.310
to finally mosey on down here.

06:00.413 --> 06:01.724
It's not like
I asked you to rush.

06:01.827 --> 06:03.586
It's only a few minutes
past 8:00, cap...

06:03.689 --> 06:04.689
When I give an order,

06:04.793 --> 06:05.758
I expect it to be followed.

06:05.862 --> 06:07.137
You understand that, right?

06:07.241 --> 06:08.931
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, then

06:09.034 --> 06:11.275
why do you keep failing
to follow them?

06:12.034 --> 06:14.310
You were supposed to be
on desk duty yesterday.

06:14.413 --> 06:16.000
Somehow you ended up
in the middle

06:16.103 --> 06:18.103
of an ATM heist in downtown
Austin. What, you have, like,

06:18.206 --> 06:19.448
a thing for defying me?

06:19.551 --> 06:21.344
Uh, Cap, if I may.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.206
Uh, i-if Trey hadn't acted,

06:23.310 --> 06:25.551
countless people
would have been hurt or worse.

06:25.655 --> 06:26.862
I didn't ask for your input.

06:27.965 --> 06:29.517
Yes, sir.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.068
You've been insubordinate twice
in the last month, Barnett.

06:32.896 --> 06:34.931
That is an abysmal
batting average.

06:35.034 --> 06:36.344
DPS is far from pleased,

06:36.448 --> 06:39.655
so here it is.

06:39.758 --> 06:41.103
You're expected
to appear in front of

06:41.206 --> 06:43.068
a DPS disciplinary
board in two days' time.

06:43.172 --> 06:44.517
Cap, I was only doing
what I thought was right.

06:44.620 --> 06:45.896
Save your excuses,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.310
I already called in
all the favors I can

06:47.413 --> 06:49.241
to get you this far, so...

06:49.344 --> 06:50.862
you're on your own.

06:51.758 --> 06:55.206
As for you two--
my office, right now.

06:55.310 --> 06:56.275
Roger that.

06:56.379 --> 06:57.793
Yes, sir.

07:08.482 --> 07:09.758
<i>So...</i>

07:09.862 --> 07:11.793
was there anything y'all

07:11.896 --> 07:13.655
forgot to tell me
a few weeks ago?

07:15.655 --> 07:17.931
Maybe right after
that milk run to Dallas?

07:18.034 --> 07:19.517
Uh... uh...

07:19.620 --> 07:22.379
Captain... Yes, yes.

07:22.482 --> 07:24.586
Um... I'm sorry.

07:24.689 --> 07:27.551
Uh, we are sorry.

07:27.655 --> 07:30.172
We-We screwed up. Big-time.

07:30.275 --> 07:31.586
Oh, you're damn right you did.

07:34.758 --> 07:35.965
You dropped the name Grey Flag

07:36.068 --> 07:39.103
at Thanksgiving.
Only way you could have

07:39.206 --> 07:40.620
possibly known that name
is if you'd

07:40.724 --> 07:42.310
looked inside
the confidential files

07:42.413 --> 07:45.206
that you picked up in Dallas,
so why don't we start there.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.655
Why did you open them?

07:49.655 --> 07:51.206
Well, sir, it all started

07:51.310 --> 07:54.827
with the beeping
coming from inside the case...

07:54.931 --> 07:56.827
And we thought--
or-or at least I thought--

07:56.931 --> 07:59.413
that it...
it may have been a bomb.

07:59.517 --> 08:01.241
Okay, hold on a second.

08:01.344 --> 08:02.482
Something about this case

08:02.586 --> 08:03.724
is seriously
clouding your judgement.

08:03.827 --> 08:05.620
You thought that
a bag of digital watches

08:05.724 --> 08:07.724
was a bomb?

08:10.724 --> 08:12.241
We screwed up.

08:12.344 --> 08:13.931
But-but I swear to you,

08:14.034 --> 08:15.655
we did not tamper
with that evidence.

08:15.758 --> 08:17.206
Oh, I know that.

08:17.310 --> 08:18.620
I checked with evidence control.

08:18.724 --> 08:20.655
They told me the package
was delivered safely.

08:20.758 --> 08:22.931
No contamination,
no issues with chain of title.

08:23.034 --> 08:24.344
Yet you still didn't come to me.

08:24.448 --> 08:27.931
Instead, you chose to lie
to my face. Both of you.

08:32.344 --> 08:34.413
Look, if there's anything
else you haven't told me,

08:34.517 --> 08:36.620
anything at all...

08:38.896 --> 08:41.241
...now would be
the time to speak up.

08:44.103 --> 08:45.551
Captain, um...

08:49.827 --> 08:51.344
There's nothing. No, sir.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.896
Um, nothing more to report.

08:53.896 --> 08:55.827
Good. Get the hell
out of my office,

08:55.931 --> 08:57.413
shut the door behind you.

08:57.517 --> 08:59.068
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

09:17.379 --> 09:18.517
I got to say, guys, uh,

09:18.620 --> 09:19.931
in all the years I've known him,

09:20.034 --> 09:22.896
I have never seen
Captain James like that.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.172
I'm really sorry, guys.

09:24.275 --> 09:26.034
I feel like
this is all my fault.

09:26.137 --> 09:27.689
- Wait, how?
- I'm the one who slipped up

09:27.793 --> 09:28.862
and said the name Grey Flag.

09:28.965 --> 09:30.275
No, no, no, Cass, no.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.482
You and I both decided
to lie to Captain James.

09:32.586 --> 09:33.517
It's both of our fault.

09:33.620 --> 09:35.482
[sighs] Man.

09:35.586 --> 09:37.482
This disciplinary hearing?

09:40.034 --> 09:42.275
Guys, I-I really
don't want to screw this up.

09:42.379 --> 09:43.689
I love being a Ranger.

09:43.793 --> 09:46.206
Hey, Trey,
you're catastrophizing.

09:46.310 --> 09:47.862
These DPS hearings,

09:47.965 --> 09:49.862
they are mostly
just an exercise.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.344
She's right. She is.

09:51.448 --> 09:52.586
Aw, heck, I've been called in

09:52.689 --> 09:54.000
more times than I care to admit,

09:54.103 --> 09:55.862
and I've survived
relatively unscathed.

09:55.965 --> 09:57.241
- You know?
- Yeah.

09:57.344 --> 09:58.965
But there are things
that can help.

09:59.068 --> 10:00.655
You should
talk to Liam. Honestly.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.034
He's given me plenty of free

10:02.137 --> 10:03.517
legal advice over the years.
It'll help.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.103
Good point. I'm sure he knows

10:05.206 --> 10:07.448
DPS rules and regs
inside and out.

10:07.551 --> 10:10.517
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Uh, thank you.

10:10.620 --> 10:11.862
Yeah.

10:11.965 --> 10:13.620
- I appreciate it, guys.
- Of course.

10:15.413 --> 10:18.103
Well, I guess I should call
Kevin and cancel for tonight.

10:18.206 --> 10:19.862
Wait, what? Why?

10:19.965 --> 10:22.448
I mean, I know why, but don't.

10:22.551 --> 10:23.862
You shouldn't cancel. Go.

10:23.965 --> 10:25.896
Have fun. You know,
work-life balance, right?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.689
Call me crazy, but there's
something about

10:27.793 --> 10:28.965
being chewed out by your boss

10:29.068 --> 10:30.586
that kind of
puts a damper on things.

10:30.689 --> 10:31.724
Yeah, I mean, I get that,

10:31.827 --> 10:33.172
but there's nothing that we can

10:33.275 --> 10:34.793
really do about it right now.
Walker's right.

10:34.896 --> 10:36.655
- Go have fun.
- Yeah, go.

10:36.758 --> 10:38.172
What, is he paying
you guys or something?

10:38.275 --> 10:40.586
- Go.
- Go.

10:40.689 --> 10:42.655
Okay, fine. I will go.

10:42.758 --> 10:44.310
Good. And I have
to go right now.

10:44.413 --> 10:46.551
I promised Stella I would help
her out at the Side Step.

10:46.655 --> 10:48.344
- Okay.
- Catch you later.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.620
Thanks for the coffee.

11:11.448 --> 11:12.448
Hey.

11:12.551 --> 11:14.103
- Hi.
- Uh...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.862
...thank you for, uh, uh,

11:16.965 --> 11:19.551
meeting with me
on-on such short notice.

11:19.655 --> 11:20.931
- Said you wanted to talk.
- Yeah.

11:21.034 --> 11:22.310
I'm ready to listen.

11:23.344 --> 11:25.965
Okay, yeah, uh, um...

11:27.758 --> 11:29.379
So, I still have the, uh,

11:29.482 --> 11:31.758
energy drinks.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.896
So you didn't submit it
to the crime lab?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.241
- No.
- Interesting.

11:37.344 --> 11:38.551
Yeah.

11:38.655 --> 11:40.724
And what made you
change your mind?

11:43.448 --> 11:44.965
You. [laughs] You did.

11:45.068 --> 11:48.000
Uh, you know,
all the stuff you said before

11:48.103 --> 11:50.000
about the possibility
of a mole inside the Rangers.

11:50.103 --> 11:51.310
Do you think that Captain James

11:51.413 --> 11:52.793
might actually be
involved in all this?

11:52.896 --> 11:54.551
James? No. God, no.
Not-not a chance.

11:54.655 --> 11:57.241
All I'm saying is that...

11:57.344 --> 11:58.896
So, James didn't seem,

11:59.000 --> 12:01.793
like, angry with me,
so much as he seemed,

12:01.896 --> 12:04.034
um, like, disappointed,
you know?

12:04.137 --> 12:05.827
Like he felt betrayed.
And now I think

12:05.931 --> 12:07.827
that his personal feelings
might be

12:07.931 --> 12:09.655
clouding his judgement
about this case.

12:09.758 --> 12:11.206
The same could be said for you.

12:12.137 --> 12:13.931
Could be said,
and it-it was said

12:14.034 --> 12:15.896
by Captain James.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.448
So what's Ranger Perez's
take on all this?

12:21.482 --> 12:23.482
Wow, you haven't told her?

12:23.586 --> 12:25.448
Or Trey.

12:26.620 --> 12:27.862
Huh.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.482
I think it's best that I wait.

12:30.586 --> 12:31.758
Not because I don't trust them,

12:31.862 --> 12:33.172
I do trust them, with my life.

12:33.275 --> 12:34.827
I-I just don't want to
drag them into this

12:34.931 --> 12:35.965
until I have
a better understanding

12:36.068 --> 12:37.275
of what I'm dealing with.

12:37.379 --> 12:38.413
Because you don't
want to get the people

12:38.517 --> 12:40.103
closest to you hurt.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.724
I told you,
I'm good at reading people.

12:43.827 --> 12:45.448
And believe me, I get it.

12:45.551 --> 12:48.137
I've made similar calls
on dangerous assignments.

12:48.241 --> 12:51.620
I... I think our jobs
are actually a lot alike.

12:51.724 --> 12:54.965
That why you've
chosen to trust me?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.896
I've chosen to work with you.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.310
Uh, trust is a-is an
ongoing process.

13:03.413 --> 13:05.655
- Fair enough.
- Fair enough.

13:05.758 --> 13:06.965
But, I...

13:07.068 --> 13:09.482
I would like to do this
your way, Julia.

13:09.586 --> 13:10.551
Um,

13:10.655 --> 13:12.137
off the books, you know?

13:12.241 --> 13:13.517
No one knows but you and me.

13:13.620 --> 13:16.034
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:17.862 --> 13:19.827
Let's go.

13:21.620 --> 13:24.517
Oh, there's still crud
on the side of this one, hon.

13:24.620 --> 13:25.620
All right.

13:25.724 --> 13:27.275
Fine.

13:27.379 --> 13:28.827
Well, you don't have to
take it so personally.

13:28.931 --> 13:31.034
It's just a dirty plate.

13:32.275 --> 13:33.896
It ain't the plate
that's irking me.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.724
I figured.

13:35.827 --> 13:38.344
So, tell me, why are your undies

13:38.448 --> 13:40.517
in such a bunch
over this family meeting?

13:40.620 --> 13:41.758
My undies are just fine,

13:41.862 --> 13:42.862
thank you.

13:42.965 --> 13:44.275
Okay, so,

13:44.379 --> 13:46.034
why don't you discuss
what you want to discuss

13:46.137 --> 13:49.379
at our weekly family dinner,
like we always do?

13:52.137 --> 13:53.586
Because this is different.

13:53.689 --> 13:56.068
I mean, William's been
nipping at my heels

13:56.172 --> 13:58.413
about this damn charity thing,

13:58.517 --> 14:00.310
the Side Step's a mess...

14:02.344 --> 14:03.827
...and Cordell's
considering moving out.

14:03.931 --> 14:07.448
Why in the world would
Cordell consider moving out?

14:09.689 --> 14:11.172
Because I asked him to.

14:12.413 --> 14:16.034
I'm sorry, Abeline, but
after your TIA, I got scared.

14:16.137 --> 14:18.724
And that boy needs
to get his own house in order.

14:18.827 --> 14:22.379
He can't-he can't... he can't be
expecting you to fix his family,

14:22.482 --> 14:24.827
not when your focus
should be on your health.

14:24.931 --> 14:26.379
Fix his family?

14:26.482 --> 14:28.275
We are his family.

14:29.551 --> 14:31.068
So, I'm curious
how you decided

14:31.172 --> 14:33.103
that abandoning our son
when he needs us the most

14:33.206 --> 14:34.896
is-is best for my health.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.482
It ain't abandoning him,

14:36.586 --> 14:38.862
it's putting his
responsibility back on him

14:38.965 --> 14:40.413
where it belongs, that's all.

14:40.517 --> 14:41.620
Oh, I am really glad

14:41.724 --> 14:43.482
that we're having
this family meeting now,

14:43.586 --> 14:45.551
because it's the perfect opportunity

14:45.655 --> 14:47.413
to apologize to Cordell,
and remind him

14:47.517 --> 14:50.034
that they are welcome
to stay in that farmhouse

14:50.137 --> 14:51.793
for as long as they please.

14:51.896 --> 14:54.000
Let him decide.

14:54.965 --> 14:56.448
Finish the dishes yourself.

15:32.206 --> 15:33.551
Okay, thank you.

15:46.068 --> 15:47.103
Cass.

15:47.206 --> 15:49.379
- Hi.
- Wow, you look fantastic.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.275
Thanks. So do you.

15:52.379 --> 15:54.517
- Here, sit down.
I'll get your seat.
- Oh, great.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.034
Wow, thank you.

15:56.137 --> 15:58.000
What a gentleman.

16:02.068 --> 16:03.620
- Well, this is a great place.
- Yeah.

16:03.724 --> 16:04.758
How'd you find it?

16:05.586 --> 16:08.137
Well, I actually
reached out to your brother

16:08.241 --> 16:09.827
for some restaurant recommendations,

16:09.931 --> 16:12.517
and Ben said when he's
in the mood for great brisket

16:12.620 --> 16:14.896
and can't get ahold of
your abuela's, he comes here.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.620
So, I am hoping

16:16.724 --> 16:19.655
it is befitting of barbecue
royalty such as yourself.

16:19.758 --> 16:23.931
Ah, very smart.

16:24.034 --> 16:25.034
You did your research.

16:25.137 --> 16:26.965
Now I just hope

16:27.068 --> 16:28.448
they have some good beers on tap

16:28.551 --> 16:31.000
because I could use a keg.
Or two.

16:31.103 --> 16:32.862
- Oh, tough day?
- Mm.

16:32.965 --> 16:34.068
Something happen at work?

16:34.172 --> 16:37.793
Um, yeah,
a lot happened at work.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.655
- Mm.
- But you know what?

16:40.620 --> 16:42.241
I don't want to
talk about any of it.

16:42.344 --> 16:44.413
And, no,
not because of my rules,

16:44.517 --> 16:47.965
but because I would
much rather talk about you.

16:48.068 --> 16:49.413
You already know

16:49.517 --> 16:50.896
so much about me, I feel like

16:51.000 --> 16:52.310
I'm at a major
disadvantage here.

16:53.275 --> 16:55.965
Okay, uh... great.

16:56.068 --> 16:58.068
Uh, what do you want to know?

16:58.172 --> 17:00.103
Um, well,

17:00.206 --> 17:02.000
how about everything?

17:02.103 --> 17:04.758
And I freely admit

17:04.862 --> 17:07.896
that I did already do
a little research online,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.034
but hardly anything came up.

17:10.137 --> 17:12.103
- Mm.
- Except a highly-curated

17:12.206 --> 17:14.103
- Instagram account...
- Yeah.

17:14.206 --> 17:15.344
that you use for work,

17:15.448 --> 17:17.379
so all I've seen
are pictures of you

17:17.482 --> 17:19.310
at various
ribbon-cutting ceremonies,

17:19.413 --> 17:21.275
holding a giant
pair of scissors.

17:21.379 --> 17:23.413
Very big scissors, always.

17:23.517 --> 17:24.965
- Why?
- I don't even know
what's up with that.

17:25.068 --> 17:26.655
I don't know. Uh...

17:26.758 --> 17:29.206
But the fact that your
web search was a bust

17:29.310 --> 17:30.862
is kind of by design.

17:30.965 --> 17:32.275
Oh, makes sense.

17:32.379 --> 17:33.689
I assumed as much.

17:33.793 --> 17:36.758
Did you have your
Internet presence scrubbed?

17:36.862 --> 17:37.793
- Oh, yeah.
- Hmm.

17:37.896 --> 17:38.862
Like pretty much every other

17:38.965 --> 17:39.862
person in politics these days.

17:39.965 --> 17:41.379
Yeah. Now tell me

17:41.482 --> 17:43.379
- all your dirty little secrets.
- Oh,

17:43.482 --> 17:44.931
wow, I wish I had any.

17:45.034 --> 17:46.068
I really wish

17:46.172 --> 17:47.965
I was that interesting, but...

17:48.068 --> 17:50.655
Oh. Oh, well, actually, um...

17:50.758 --> 17:52.827
No, there was this
really embarrassing photo.

17:52.931 --> 17:54.344
Hmm?

17:54.448 --> 17:56.965
It was on
my grandmother's Facebook page

17:57.068 --> 17:58.448
for, like, a week.

17:58.551 --> 18:00.689
- From my communion
when I was seven.
- Oof.

18:00.793 --> 18:04.068
- Yeah.
- Well, I would pay
big money to see that.

18:04.172 --> 18:05.896
No, it is gone forever.

18:06.000 --> 18:07.586
Oh, a shame

18:12.689 --> 18:14.482
Seriously, Cass,

18:14.586 --> 18:16.793
my life's an open book.

18:16.896 --> 18:18.793
What do you want to know?

18:23.931 --> 18:25.206
So, here's my issue.

18:25.310 --> 18:26.862
I'm-I'm still
having a difficult time

18:26.965 --> 18:29.655
trying to wrap my head
around the, uh...

18:30.827 --> 18:31.965
Grey Flag of it all.

18:32.068 --> 18:34.310
I mean, we shut them down.

18:35.103 --> 18:36.413
Not according to my sources.

18:36.517 --> 18:37.896
Your... your sources?

18:38.000 --> 18:41.620
Oh, are these more, uh,
"unnamed" sources? Great.

18:41.724 --> 18:43.896
Calm down.
I can actually name these.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.896
Calm down.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.689
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:48.793 --> 18:50.137
Move over.

18:51.517 --> 18:52.551
Whoa.

18:53.379 --> 18:55.103
Okay, I got to admit,
I'm usually

18:55.206 --> 18:57.517
more of a "scribble on the back
of a napkin" kind of guy.

18:57.620 --> 19:00.344
I have entire hard drives
filled with research like this.

19:00.448 --> 19:02.068
Where are these from?

19:02.172 --> 19:03.896
These seem like, uh,

19:04.000 --> 19:05.310
dark web kind of stuff.

19:05.413 --> 19:06.931
Eh, a variety
of extremist websites.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.275
Lots of chatter about

19:08.379 --> 19:09.482
our friends Grey Flag
on the darknet.

19:09.586 --> 19:10.931
What kind of chatter?

19:11.034 --> 19:13.206
I-I haven't heard anything
about any chatter.

19:13.310 --> 19:14.896
Well, maybe I have better intel.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.344
Then the Rangers?
I doubt it.

19:18.448 --> 19:20.413
Maybe you're just not
need to know.

19:20.517 --> 19:22.448
Bet Captain James
has been read in.

19:22.551 --> 19:25.517
There we go again.
All right, yup, great.

19:25.620 --> 19:26.793
- That's great.
- What?

19:26.896 --> 19:28.448
What?

19:28.551 --> 19:31.172
You're trying to drive a wedge
between Captain James and me.

19:31.275 --> 19:32.827
No, I-I'm not. Honestly.

19:32.931 --> 19:34.620
But as a reporter,

19:34.724 --> 19:36.172
I need to keep an open mind.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.517
Consider all sides.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.103
As a Ranger, I do the same.

19:40.206 --> 19:41.551
Well, open your mind to this:

19:41.655 --> 19:43.689
- Grey Flag is back and...
- I-I...

19:43.793 --> 19:45.379
I can open my mind to that.
What I can't do

19:45.482 --> 19:47.517
is issue a warrant
based on-on rumors

19:47.620 --> 19:49.827
and innuendo
and-and dark web chatter.

19:49.931 --> 19:51.172
I need names.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.793
Names, Julia.

19:52.896 --> 19:56.344
So-so, who are the people
still running Grey Flag?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.827
I honestly don't know.

19:59.931 --> 20:01.896
So, how am I supposed to know
that any of this is real?

20:02.000 --> 20:02.965
You trust me.

20:03.068 --> 20:04.758
And think about this.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.344
You didn't know

20:06.448 --> 20:08.413
a damn thing about that chemist
that nearly killed you.

20:08.517 --> 20:10.827
That, uh...
He... he didn't...

20:10.931 --> 20:12.448
he didn't nearly kill me.

20:12.551 --> 20:13.896
Well, whatever.
You understand my point.

20:14.000 --> 20:17.551
The bottom line is,
Grey Flag is regrouping

20:17.655 --> 20:19.551
and rebuilding, and the sooner

20:19.655 --> 20:22.034
you wrap your head
around that simple fact,

20:22.137 --> 20:23.413
the better, because,

20:23.517 --> 20:26.517
for some unknown reason,
Cordell Walker,

20:26.620 --> 20:28.620
you're their prime target.

20:30.862 --> 20:32.448
Mmm. It's just there
all the time.

20:32.551 --> 20:35.034
Mm-hmm. Well, I am
definitely a workaholic.

20:35.137 --> 20:36.241
- Mmm.
- Absolutely.

20:36.344 --> 20:37.689
Me too.

20:37.793 --> 20:39.482
We could
go to meetings together.

20:39.586 --> 20:41.482
Oh, yeah, that sounds like fun.

20:43.103 --> 20:44.448
No, actually, I think
I inherited that gene

20:44.551 --> 20:46.344
from my mother.
Um, no,

20:46.448 --> 20:48.793
she wouldn't bat an eye
at working a 14-hour day.

20:48.896 --> 20:49.965
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:50.068 --> 20:50.965
- Was she also a politician?
- Mm.

20:52.413 --> 20:53.793
No, nothing like that.

20:53.896 --> 20:55.551
She, um, never actually
even finished college.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.517
- Oh.
- No. My dad passed away
when I was ten.

20:58.620 --> 21:00.275
Oh, Kevin, I'm so sorry.

21:00.379 --> 21:02.034
Oh, uh, thank you.

21:02.137 --> 21:03.655
Uh, he was a good man.

21:03.758 --> 21:06.275
He was a great man, actually.

21:06.379 --> 21:08.655
Uh, anyway, once he died,

21:08.758 --> 21:10.655
my mom was forced
to take on two jobs--

21:10.758 --> 21:13.034
neither of them good--
and somehow managed

21:13.137 --> 21:15.275
to scrape enough money together
to support us both,

21:15.379 --> 21:16.931
and then send me
to college, so...

21:17.034 --> 21:19.310
- Wow.
- Yeah, she's kind of my hero.

21:19.413 --> 21:21.137
That's so sweet.

21:21.241 --> 21:24.206
I mean, I can kind of relate.

21:24.310 --> 21:25.310
Um...

21:25.413 --> 21:27.965
I mean, I spent my teenage years

21:28.068 --> 21:31.379
watching my abuela work 12-hour
shifts at our family restaurant.

21:31.482 --> 21:33.689
You know, her famous

21:33.793 --> 21:36.965
barbecue brisket
supported the entire family.

21:37.068 --> 21:38.862
Well, um,

21:38.965 --> 21:40.241
a toast.

21:40.344 --> 21:41.827
To our respective families.

21:41.931 --> 21:43.172
Mm.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.758
And in the interest
of full disclosure,

21:47.862 --> 21:50.137
I was gonna
cancel on you tonight.

21:50.241 --> 21:52.137
- Really?
- But not because of you,

21:52.241 --> 21:53.413
because of
what happened at work.

21:53.517 --> 21:55.344
- Mm.
- And, no,

21:55.448 --> 21:58.103
I still don't
want to talk about it,

21:58.206 --> 22:00.103
but my point is

22:00.206 --> 22:02.586
I'm very glad I came.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.965
Tonight was a lot of fun.

22:06.034 --> 22:07.448
I agree.

22:08.482 --> 22:10.586
So, why is Grey Flag

22:10.689 --> 22:12.586
so obsessed with
my time in the military?

22:12.689 --> 22:13.655
Knowledge is power.

22:13.758 --> 22:15.275
You said it yourself--

22:15.379 --> 22:16.586
they're trying to break you.

22:16.689 --> 22:18.206
The more personal info

22:18.310 --> 22:20.586
they can glean, the more likely
they are to succeed.

22:20.689 --> 22:22.586
Yeah, right. Uh, but, I mean,

22:22.689 --> 22:25.068
that-that brand of energy drink

22:25.172 --> 22:27.034
is very specific.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.482
It was only produced
for a few years

22:29.586 --> 22:31.586
and only distributed
in MRE's given to Marines.

22:31.689 --> 22:35.448
Only way to get your hands
on it now is through eBay.

22:35.551 --> 22:36.965
I didn't realize that.

22:37.068 --> 22:38.827
Uh, I guess
I have my sources, too.

22:38.931 --> 22:40.655
Hmm.

22:40.758 --> 22:42.655
Mostly me. I was there.

22:42.758 --> 22:45.275
Oh, right, and-and,
from what you're saying,

22:45.379 --> 22:47.034
our guy must have served

22:47.137 --> 22:49.172
around the same time you did.

22:49.275 --> 22:50.965
Yeah, along with

22:51.068 --> 22:53.000
hundreds of thousands
of other marines

22:53.103 --> 22:55.655
who-who spent time over there
during that period.

22:55.758 --> 22:57.034
It doesn't really
narrow it down.

22:57.137 --> 22:59.689
I just got the strangest
sense of déjà vu.

22:59.793 --> 23:02.241
Didn't we
talk about this already

23:02.344 --> 23:04.655
when I first interviewed you?

23:05.931 --> 23:07.724
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
it was the same

23:07.827 --> 23:10.413
brand of energy drink
they served me in captivity.

23:11.310 --> 23:13.379
Right, but there was
another story you told me.

23:13.482 --> 23:15.586
Luckily, I write
everything down.

23:17.103 --> 23:18.551
None of it ever made it
into the article,

23:18.655 --> 23:20.379
but I think you told me

23:20.482 --> 23:21.965
that those energy drinks
became like

23:22.068 --> 23:24.551
an inside joke in your unit
for some reason.

23:24.655 --> 23:26.068
- Is that...
- Yeah, yeah.

23:26.172 --> 23:29.000
Uh, because we had
so many cans of that garbage

23:29.103 --> 23:31.517
from the DoD,
we-we got sick of it.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.620
I take great notes.
Be careful.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.379
But seriously, Walker,
have you considered

23:37.482 --> 23:41.103
the fact that the person
running Grey Flag

23:41.206 --> 23:42.413
could be a fellow marine?

23:42.517 --> 23:44.689
Maybe even one from your unit?

23:52.103 --> 23:54.275
You know...

23:54.379 --> 23:56.137
I don't think that's possible.

23:57.758 --> 24:00.379
You have some idea what
it's like in a combat zone?

24:00.482 --> 24:01.655
You know, the time

24:01.758 --> 24:03.482
you spend in a foxhole

24:03.586 --> 24:05.448
with the person next to you...

24:05.551 --> 24:07.655
You know,
the five of us, we were...

24:10.206 --> 24:11.931
We were like brothers.

24:13.137 --> 24:15.517
Cain and Abel
were brothers, too.

24:20.965 --> 24:23.344
- I'm just saying, an open mi...
- I'm gonna...

24:23.448 --> 24:24.793
Give me a sec.

24:34.448 --> 24:36.482
It's open.

24:40.241 --> 24:41.413
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:41.517 --> 24:42.793
Peace offering.

24:42.896 --> 24:44.275
Uh...

24:45.206 --> 24:48.482
I know I pissed you off
last night, and I'm sorry.

24:48.586 --> 24:50.068
I'm sure you don't
eat carbs, but...

24:50.172 --> 24:51.310
You didn't piss me off.

24:51.413 --> 24:53.310
Uh...

24:53.413 --> 24:56.000
Okay. Maybe a little.

24:56.103 --> 24:58.551
You forget that my superpower
is reading people.

24:58.655 --> 25:01.000
I'm-I'm practically a telepath.

25:01.103 --> 25:05.034
Okay. Well, then, Ms., uh,
Practically A Telepath,

25:05.137 --> 25:06.724
you should already know that
I wasn't pissed off at you.

25:06.827 --> 25:09.310
Just trying to
wrap my mind around the fact

25:09.413 --> 25:12.310
that I'm potentially being
targeted by a former brother.

25:12.413 --> 25:13.344
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

25:13.448 --> 25:14.344
Not a pleasant feeling.

25:14.448 --> 25:15.655
No, no.

25:15.758 --> 25:17.241
It's unsettling,
to say the least.

25:17.344 --> 25:20.241
Uh, but, as a matter of fact,
I'm happy you're here.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.724
Uh, there's something
I want to show you.

25:22.827 --> 25:25.034
Uh, follow me.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.620
All right.

25:27.724 --> 25:30.724
Marine Raiders.

25:30.827 --> 25:33.482
Special ops. We were divided
into groups of five,

25:33.586 --> 25:37.862
so those four men and myself,

25:37.965 --> 25:39.413
we were Raider Team 3.

25:39.517 --> 25:40.931
So these four guys,

25:41.034 --> 25:42.586
they're the only ones who knew

25:42.689 --> 25:44.827
about the inside joke
about the energy drinks?

25:44.931 --> 25:45.965
Correct.

25:47.275 --> 25:50.275
Do know think any of them might
have had a grudge against you

25:50.379 --> 25:51.724
- for some reason?
- No.

25:51.827 --> 25:55.448
Uh, well, not that I know of.

25:56.344 --> 25:59.310
And we know it can't be Coop,
for obvious reasons.

25:59.413 --> 26:00.724
Okay.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.965
Sooner we figure out motive,
sooner we can narrow it down,

26:07.068 --> 26:09.379
but we don't have a lot of time.

26:09.482 --> 26:12.103
Because one of these guys
could be hunting you.

26:19.310 --> 26:20.620
Whoa. Knock-knock.

26:20.724 --> 26:22.206
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.344
Oh, I'm sorry to just pop in
on you at work like this.

26:24.448 --> 26:27.344
No, come in, come in. I'm just
finishing up some paperwork.

26:27.448 --> 26:28.827
What brings you by?

26:28.931 --> 26:31.034
You know, I just wanted
to talk about last night.

26:31.137 --> 26:32.379
I know you said you were
upset about something

26:32.482 --> 26:34.068
that happened at work.

26:34.172 --> 26:35.344
It's fine.

26:35.448 --> 26:37.586
Really, I had a great time
with you, Kevin.

26:37.689 --> 26:40.206
Good. Good, I'm glad.
Me too.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.758
It's just...
Well, at my work, um,

26:44.862 --> 26:46.689
I heard a rumor
about Captain James

26:46.793 --> 26:47.965
going on the warpath yesterday,

26:48.068 --> 26:49.758
and then Trey
called me and told me

26:49.862 --> 26:52.413
about the disciplinary
review, and...

26:52.517 --> 26:55.172
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
That sucks.

26:55.275 --> 26:56.931
And I understand
why you were upset.

26:57.034 --> 26:58.793
Well, that's really
sweet of you.

26:58.896 --> 27:00.241
But you don't have to

27:00.344 --> 27:04.206
take this on.
It's going to be fine.

27:04.310 --> 27:05.931
Is it?

27:07.241 --> 27:10.551
Look, uh, the mayor still
plans on honoring all of you

27:10.655 --> 27:11.689
in a few weeks for your heroism.

27:11.793 --> 27:13.137
Mm-hmm.

27:13.241 --> 27:16.172
But I can't exactly
have my boss pin medals

27:16.275 --> 27:18.517
on Rangers under
disciplinary review.

27:18.620 --> 27:20.896
I mean, how would that look?

27:22.068 --> 27:25.137
Well, maybe you should
ask them to postpone the event.

27:25.241 --> 27:26.482
Thought of that.

27:26.586 --> 27:29.103
But then I thought
of an ever better idea.

27:29.206 --> 27:30.896
See, it turns out the mayor
has a certain amount of pull

27:31.000 --> 27:33.103
at DPS, so I called in a favor,

27:33.206 --> 27:35.689
and bottom line,
I'm gonna be able to spin this

27:35.793 --> 27:37.206
in a much more
favorable direction

27:37.310 --> 27:39.862
for all of us.

27:41.068 --> 27:42.758
Kevin...

27:42.862 --> 27:45.000
I really wish
you hadn't done that.

27:46.206 --> 27:48.896
But I can make
all of this go away.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.517
Great.
But I didn't ask you to.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.793
I asked you specifically

27:53.896 --> 27:55.689
to keep my work life

27:55.793 --> 27:57.517
- and my personal life separate.
- I know,

27:57.620 --> 27:59.137
- I-I know, but...
- But you chose

27:59.241 --> 28:01.517
to ignore me,
and you did it anyway.

28:01.620 --> 28:02.896
This is exactly

28:03.000 --> 28:04.137
why I was worried about
getting into

28:04.241 --> 28:06.137
- a relationship with you.
- Whoa, Cass,

28:06.241 --> 28:08.000
I'm sorry.

28:08.103 --> 28:09.482
Really, I-I'm sorry.

28:09.586 --> 28:11.758
I can try to walk it back.
I can walk it back.

28:11.862 --> 28:13.413
I don't think you can.

28:15.862 --> 28:17.862
This just isn't gonna work.

28:19.517 --> 28:20.551
Cass...

28:20.655 --> 28:22.931
No, I have work to do.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.724
I got it, Bon.

28:33.827 --> 28:35.034
All right.

28:41.551 --> 28:42.965
Hey, Mr. Walker.

28:43.068 --> 28:45.344
It's, uh, it's good to see you.

28:45.448 --> 28:47.206
Well, I think you've
known me long enough

28:47.310 --> 28:49.517
to call me by
my first name, Barnett.

28:50.931 --> 28:51.896
But if you're
here to see Cordell,

28:52.000 --> 28:53.310
he's over at the farmhouse.

28:53.413 --> 28:57.000
Uh, no, I'm-I'm
actually here to see Liam.

28:58.034 --> 29:00.172
Oh, that's right.

29:00.275 --> 29:02.551
You had that little tiff
with Captain James.

29:02.655 --> 29:04.517
Yeah.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.931
Where's my manners?
Can I get you some coffee

29:06.034 --> 29:07.551
- or something?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

29:07.655 --> 29:09.172
- Uh, coffee would be great.
Thank you.
- Great.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.172
It's wearing on you, huh?

29:15.275 --> 29:17.517
Yup. Yup.

29:18.551 --> 29:20.620
My mom's gonna have a field day
with this one.

29:20.724 --> 29:21.965
Oh.

29:23.034 --> 29:25.206
I reckon she will.

29:26.758 --> 29:28.379
Thank you.

29:32.034 --> 29:33.379
But, uh...

29:33.482 --> 29:35.241
I mean, I've been lucky,
though, right?

29:36.068 --> 29:38.000
I mean, I got a chance
to try my hand

29:38.103 --> 29:39.517
at a variety
of different careers,

29:39.620 --> 29:41.551
and I've liked them all,

29:41.655 --> 29:45.413
but, man, being with
the Rangers, that's...

29:46.586 --> 29:47.896
that's the first time
that I've felt like

29:48.000 --> 29:49.448
I'm where I belong.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.344
Because it is.

29:54.275 --> 29:56.931
You were born
to do this job, son.

29:57.034 --> 29:58.689
I ain't just blowing smoke.

29:58.793 --> 30:01.275
I've seen it firsthand.

30:01.379 --> 30:02.931
And Captain James

30:03.034 --> 30:06.275
and all those other folks over
at DPS-- they've seen it too.

30:07.551 --> 30:09.793
They're not gonna
let a man like you go.

30:11.241 --> 30:14.482
Anyway, that's my opinion.

30:14.586 --> 30:16.172
Not that you asked for it.

30:17.965 --> 30:19.241
Thank you, sir.

30:20.517 --> 30:21.931
Thank you.

30:24.034 --> 30:27.000
So, after Coop was KIA,
then what?

30:27.103 --> 30:29.551
A few months later,
I-I was back home.

30:29.655 --> 30:32.551
- And then these guys?
- They all reenlisted,

30:32.655 --> 30:35.413
uh, served at least
one additional tour.

30:35.517 --> 30:37.172
Uh, then...

30:37.275 --> 30:39.275
you know, we just
kind of lost touch

30:39.379 --> 30:41.448
over the years.
I-I really couldn't tell you.

30:41.551 --> 30:43.034
Lucky for us,

30:43.137 --> 30:44.413
I just happen to have access

30:44.517 --> 30:46.103
to a Pentagon database

30:46.206 --> 30:49.517
that could help us
fill in some blanks.

30:50.620 --> 30:52.068
Hang tight.

30:56.448 --> 30:58.103
Okay, got something.

30:58.206 --> 31:02.000
- Marine Bravo,
aka Robert Ortiz...
- Mm-hmm.

31:02.103 --> 31:04.931
...returned stateside
about ten years back.

31:05.034 --> 31:07.965
Got married, bought a house, but

31:08.068 --> 31:11.000
suffered a heart attack
last year and died.

31:13.034 --> 31:15.655
What? A heart attack?

31:15.758 --> 31:17.379
Young guy.

31:18.655 --> 31:20.965
So...

31:21.068 --> 31:23.000
Marine Charlie,

31:23.103 --> 31:24.034
- aka Sam Turner...
- Sam Turner, yeah.

31:24.137 --> 31:25.758
...returned home, 2016,

31:25.862 --> 31:27.241
got married, had a kid,

31:27.344 --> 31:28.965
but was killed in a car accident

31:29.068 --> 31:30.448
six months ago.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.482
- Uh...
- I'm so sorry.

31:33.586 --> 31:35.586
Hold-hold on.

31:35.689 --> 31:39.379
So, they're both... gone?

31:43.931 --> 31:47.000
And it looks like Marine Alpha,

31:47.103 --> 31:48.862
aka Tommy Adams,

31:48.965 --> 31:51.000
is still alive and kicking.

31:52.689 --> 31:54.068
Never been married, no kids.

31:54.172 --> 31:56.068
Current location unknown.

31:58.931 --> 32:00.586
So...

32:02.068 --> 32:04.000
We have...

32:04.793 --> 32:08.000
Charlie, Bravo.

32:08.103 --> 32:10.310
Pretty sure
you're not our suspect.

32:11.344 --> 32:12.241
Yeah.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.137
So, by process of elimination,

32:14.241 --> 32:16.000
there's a really good chance

32:16.103 --> 32:18.344
your old friend

32:18.448 --> 32:20.620
Tommy Adams might be the man

32:20.724 --> 32:23.000
behind Grey Flag.

32:27.448 --> 32:30.482
All right.

32:31.482 --> 32:33.000
Now we just got to find him.

32:39.517 --> 32:41.068
Well...

32:41.172 --> 32:43.724
I know, Bonham, I know.

32:43.827 --> 32:45.103
I said 7:00.

32:45.206 --> 32:46.931
And they're late, as usual.

32:47.034 --> 32:48.896
Almost an hour.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.517
It's downright disrespectful.

32:51.517 --> 32:53.000
Yes.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.344
But what's really bothering you?

32:58.103 --> 32:59.241
I mean truly.

32:59.344 --> 33:00.517
Ever since my health scare

33:00.620 --> 33:02.758
and this idea you have
that Cordell

33:02.862 --> 33:04.551
needs to get his house in order,

33:04.655 --> 33:07.000
and everything
that's going on with Liam...

33:08.137 --> 33:10.000
Is it about
who's taking over the ranch?

33:11.896 --> 33:14.137
Well, that concern's not new.

33:14.241 --> 33:15.758
No, it's not.

33:15.862 --> 33:17.103
And this fight isn't either.

33:17.206 --> 33:19.793
Look, it's not really a fight.

33:19.896 --> 33:21.827
How we disagree
about raising our sons?

33:21.931 --> 33:23.137
No, you're absolutely right,

33:23.241 --> 33:24.275
it's more of a fixture
at this point.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.793
Well, what can I say?

33:26.896 --> 33:29.103
It didn't exactly turn out
to be the pretty picture

33:29.206 --> 33:31.275
that I always
imagined it would be.

33:39.034 --> 33:41.172
It's William.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.413
Yeah.

33:45.448 --> 33:47.758
Gramps is gonna be pissed.

33:47.862 --> 33:49.758
I know, but I don't
want to talk to him

33:49.862 --> 33:52.206
until I know exactly what we're
doing with this horse rescue.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.172
And, truth is, I...

33:54.275 --> 33:56.310
my meeting with the accountant
did go long, so...

33:56.413 --> 33:57.931
Oh, was that helpful?
Tell me what she said.

33:58.034 --> 34:00.448
- I'm excited to get going
on this thing.
- Yeah, so,

34:00.551 --> 34:02.310
great news.
Uh, now, granted,

34:02.413 --> 34:03.827
this is just a rough estimate,

34:03.931 --> 34:06.310
but she thinks that we'd
be able to save up to 30%

34:06.413 --> 34:08.551
on taxes alone
in the first year.

34:08.655 --> 34:09.931
That's amazing.

34:10.034 --> 34:11.172
With that kind of money,

34:11.275 --> 34:13.000
we could build out
the pipe corrals.

34:13.103 --> 34:15.000
Yeah, or we could
hire a therapist

34:15.103 --> 34:16.586
full time if we wanted.

34:16.689 --> 34:19.206
- Or we could do both.
- We could do both.

34:19.310 --> 34:21.172
She also had a really

34:21.275 --> 34:24.482
interesting idea
of bringing you in as partner.

34:26.241 --> 34:28.931
Uh... I thought I already was.

34:29.034 --> 34:30.344
Yeah, no, you are.

34:30.448 --> 34:32.103
Of course. Her point is

34:32.206 --> 34:33.758
that you're 18 now,
you're legally an adult,

34:33.862 --> 34:36.275
you can sign contracts,
enter business agreements,

34:36.379 --> 34:38.448
and so, she thought
that it made sense

34:38.551 --> 34:41.517
to bring you in on paper.
Full partners.

34:43.172 --> 34:45.241
So what do you think?

35:04.275 --> 35:05.827
You sure this is the place?

35:05.931 --> 35:08.206
Yes, stop asking.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.896
I'm, like, 97% percent sure.

35:11.758 --> 35:13.413
It looks abandoned.

35:13.517 --> 35:16.689
Or looks like he wants us
to think it's abandoned.

35:16.793 --> 35:18.689
The source
who gave me the address

35:18.793 --> 35:20.448
has never let me down.

35:21.655 --> 35:22.758
Okay, fine.
That's a good start.

35:22.862 --> 35:27.310
Uh, so what else
did your source tell you?

35:28.172 --> 35:29.379
Uh, I'll tell you.

35:30.620 --> 35:31.896
Tommy Adams,

35:32.000 --> 35:34.206
41 years old.
Served two tours in Afghanistan.

35:34.310 --> 35:37.344
Awarded Silver Star twice.

35:37.448 --> 35:39.068
After an honorable discharge,

35:39.172 --> 35:42.793
went to work
as a private contractor,

35:42.896 --> 35:44.103
earning the big bucks

35:44.206 --> 35:46.344
babysitting
dignitaries overseas.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.206
So, combat experience,

35:48.310 --> 35:50.068
uh, special ops training,

35:50.172 --> 35:52.379
experience in
the private sector.

35:52.482 --> 35:55.034
Yeah, I'm gonna say
my old friend Tommy

35:55.137 --> 35:57.275
fits the Grey Flag profile
to a T.

35:58.206 --> 35:59.344
Yeah.

35:59.448 --> 36:01.586
And if he is in there,

36:01.689 --> 36:03.896
he's not gonna go quietly.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.275
We're gonna need backup.

36:05.379 --> 36:06.758
Yeah.

36:13.379 --> 36:15.275
Whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

36:15.379 --> 36:17.206
I was gonna use mine
to call Cassie.

36:18.724 --> 36:20.448
What are you planning
on doing with yours?

36:20.551 --> 36:23.206
Nothing. I'm always packing.

36:23.310 --> 36:26.103
Okay, uh, Julia?
Hey, Julia.

36:26.206 --> 36:28.344
N-No.
This is not a good idea.

36:29.275 --> 36:30.344
Julia, wait, wait, wait.

36:30.448 --> 36:32.689
This is very poor
decision making.

36:32.793 --> 36:34.103
No one asked you.

36:34.206 --> 36:35.862
We don't have a warrant.
Or even probable cause.

36:35.965 --> 36:38.000
So? I'm a reporter.
I'm not a cop.

36:38.103 --> 36:40.241
I can walk up to that guy's door
and ask questions

36:40.344 --> 36:41.655
- to my heart's conten...
- Okay, okay, okay, okay,

36:41.758 --> 36:43.413
yes, yes, yes,
but if your theory pans out,

36:43.517 --> 36:46.724
then Tommy is now a dangerous
psychopath with a gun.

36:46.827 --> 36:49.413
Don't worry, Walker.
I'm a big girl.

36:49.517 --> 36:51.206
With a gun.
I'll be fine.

36:59.793 --> 37:01.655
- I think this is a bad idea.
- So, don't come. I'll be fine.

37:01.758 --> 37:02.862
Okay, I'm not
so sure about that.

37:02.965 --> 37:03.931
Look, I know what kind of

37:04.034 --> 37:05.206
military training Tommy has had,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.034
and my gut tells me
we're walking

37:07.137 --> 37:08.482
- into an ambush.
- That's not how things work

37:08.586 --> 37:09.896
in the real world.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.000
I've interviewed
the head of the Taliban

37:12.103 --> 37:13.482
in a charming little
coffee shop in Kabul.

37:13.586 --> 37:15.172
These guys aren't boy scouts

37:15.275 --> 37:17.620
but they're not Bond villains,
either. It's fine.

37:20.620 --> 37:22.000
Okay, okay, hol-hold here.

37:22.103 --> 37:23.620
Just...

37:23.724 --> 37:26.344
stay close to me, okay?
Let's walk back to the truck.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.172
Sergeant Adams?

37:32.275 --> 37:33.965
This is Lieutenant
Cordell Walker.

37:34.068 --> 37:36.862
I order you to stand down.

37:44.034 --> 37:45.655
Don't fight!

37:46.517 --> 37:47.586
Don't fight back!

37:47.689 --> 37:50.241
Stop it! Don't fight!

37:50.344 --> 37:52.103
Okay? You done?

37:52.206 --> 37:54.172
Get off.

37:55.827 --> 37:58.310
You finally learned to quit
telegraphing your moves,

37:58.413 --> 37:59.758
war hero.

37:59.862 --> 38:02.137
Tommy.

38:02.241 --> 38:05.310
Dude, chill.
I'm just playing.

38:06.206 --> 38:07.413
You look good.

38:09.379 --> 38:10.724
She looks better.

38:10.827 --> 38:12.620
Listen,

38:12.724 --> 38:15.344
I'm the one that contacted you.

38:15.448 --> 38:16.379
I sent those

38:16.482 --> 38:18.517
energy drinks to your pad.

38:18.620 --> 38:19.758
Now, why'd you do that?

38:19.862 --> 38:22.689
I needed to talk to you.
To warn you.

38:22.793 --> 38:24.413
But...

38:24.517 --> 38:26.586
I thought you'd understand

38:26.689 --> 38:28.344
from the cryptic nature
of the message that I sent you

38:28.448 --> 38:29.758
to respond in kind.

38:29.862 --> 38:31.241
I didn't expect you
to show up here.

38:31.344 --> 38:33.068
I'm trying to stay off the grid.

38:33.172 --> 38:34.586
No visitors.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.275
You two think I'm crazy,
don't you?

38:38.379 --> 38:39.620
You probably think that Ortiz

38:39.724 --> 38:41.931
died of a heart attack
and that Turner

38:42.034 --> 38:44.310
was killed
in a single-car crash,

38:44.413 --> 38:46.344
or whatever it was
the police told you.

38:46.448 --> 38:47.724
No way!

38:47.827 --> 38:49.448
That's what they
want it to look like.

38:49.551 --> 38:52.137
He was run off the road.

38:52.241 --> 38:53.965
A professional hit.

38:54.068 --> 38:55.827
And Ortiz--

38:55.931 --> 38:57.310
he was poisoned,

38:57.413 --> 38:59.379
- and I know who did...
- Okay, okay, enough. Enough.

38:59.482 --> 39:01.034
Enough, all right?

39:02.206 --> 39:05.068
Why don't you just try
in plain English, Adams?

39:05.172 --> 39:07.931
What are you trying to say?

39:08.034 --> 39:09.862
That we're being hunted.

39:09.965 --> 39:11.379
Killed off.

39:12.172 --> 39:15.793
One... by one.

39:34.586 --> 39:37.206
I can't believe
you'd actually be late.

39:37.310 --> 39:39.448
Yeah, well, I have
a very good reason. Trust me.

39:39.551 --> 39:41.137
Everything okay?
What's wrong?
