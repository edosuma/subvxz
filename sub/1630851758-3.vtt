08:56.103 --> 08:57.896
- I think I'm kinda crazy, dude.

08:57.965 --> 08:59.724
- I know so,

08:59.793 --> 09:01.137
- I'll tell you what I woulda
done

09:01.206 --> 09:03.482
if I'd been in there;
crying like a little bitch

09:03.551 --> 09:04.655
is what I woulda done.

09:06.344 --> 09:08.068
- You woulda made 'em
Life Flight you, even though--

09:08.137 --> 09:09.931
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

09:10.000 --> 09:12.551
I woulda said, "My neck,
my neck and my back."

09:14.689 --> 09:15.827
- And they I woulda
on myself.

09:18.275 --> 09:21.448
- I dunno what to do.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.206
I do love him

09:23.275 --> 09:26.137
and I don't wanna be
with anyone else.

09:26.206 --> 09:27.965
- Have you called him
since you've been here?

09:28.034 --> 09:29.827
No?

09:29.896 --> 09:30.827
- No.

09:30.896 --> 09:32.482
<i>I think when I go</i>

09:32.551 --> 09:37.103
on vacations, it's nice,
because I have a peace of mind

09:37.172 --> 09:38.931
to think about what I want,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
what I wanna do,
how I can help him.

09:42.068 --> 09:43.310
But also,

09:43.379 --> 09:44.793
<i>it's a really bad thing,
because</i>

09:44.862 --> 09:47.655
<i>I'm so far away from home
I can't help him.</i>

09:47.724 --> 09:49.413
<i>I can't go get him if I need to.</i>

09:49.482 --> 09:52.724
I can't have serious
talks with him

09:52.793 --> 09:54.931
like we do when we're at home.

09:55.000 --> 09:59.137
So I think it's just
a mind cluster

10:00.655 --> 10:02.310
- Maybe like not talking to him

10:02.379 --> 10:05.758

10:10.655 --> 10:14.137
Or I'll call him, maybe,
and I'll just tell him,

10:14.206 --> 10:15.862

18:09.000 --> 18:10.965
my attention to.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.724
<i>I'm pretty notorious
for being in my own head a lot.</i>

18:16.793 --> 18:18.137
<i>And so sometimes I just
need my own personal way</i>

18:18.206 --> 18:19.758
<i>to cope with my thoughts.</i>

18:19.827 --> 18:22.172
I mean, [bleep], if Nilsa can
have an emotional support dog

18:22.241 --> 18:24.379
and Aimee gets an
emotional support pig,

18:24.448 --> 18:25.551
then [bleep], dude, I can have

18:25.620 --> 18:26.965
an emotional support ukulele,

18:27.034 --> 18:28.896
and I don't
wanna hear about it.

18:36.413 --> 18:41.793
- I don't know what
instrument that is.

18:41.862 --> 18:44.448
It looks like a mini guitar,
like a banjo.

18:44.517 --> 18:45.965
Oh, it's a banjo.

18:49.275 --> 18:51.689
It's a banjo, that's what it is.

18:51.758 --> 18:55.344
<i>- ♪ Yeah, yeah, go crazy,
go crazy ♪</i>

18:55.413 --> 18:56.413
- Is this pig [bleep]?

18:56.482 --> 18:57.793
She has to come pick this up.

18:57.862 --> 19:00.241
Come--Ravioli,
leave the pig alone.

19:00.310 --> 19:02.034
- Nilsa ain't really feelin'
PGP.

19:02.103 --> 19:05.344
- I'm not gonna pick it up;
I pick up his poop enough.

19:05.413 --> 19:09.068
- PGP is a pig, and he does
run around pooping everywhere,

19:09.137 --> 19:12.965
and unfortunately, little
Ravioli is eating his

19:13.034 --> 19:14.000
- Ravioli!

19:14.068 --> 19:15.310
- Are you okay?

19:15.379 --> 19:17.275
- No, the pig is still
pooping everywhere,

19:17.344 --> 19:19.275
and I'm so scared
Ravioli is gonna get sick.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.379
- Is he outside?

19:21.448 --> 19:23.103
- Who?
- The pig.

19:23.172 --> 19:24.655
- Yeah.

19:24.724 --> 19:25.689
- Well,
what do you want me to do,

19:25.758 --> 19:27.275
call somebody to come get it?

19:27.344 --> 19:28.965
- No, I just thought
he was gonna be, like,

19:29.034 --> 19:31.896
in a bit--like an area
where there was gonna be--

19:31.965 --> 19:33.931
- He is in an area;
he's in the fence.

19:34.000 --> 19:37.068
- But that's where
Ravioli has to go too.

19:37.137 --> 19:38.689
- I don't--I don't know
what you want me to do.

19:38.758 --> 19:40.758
- I just,
like, can't be around him, so...

19:40.827 --> 19:42.689
<i>- I don't think it's
the pooper that's the issue,</i>

19:42.758 --> 19:44.103
I think it's the poop eater.

19:44.172 --> 19:46.965
Like, maybe train your
dog not to eat

19:47.034 --> 19:49.896
<i>My pig has to [bleep].</i>

19:49.965 --> 19:51.344
He's a pig.

19:51.413 --> 19:55.172
<i>- Nilly's dog keeps
eating the pig's poop.</i>

19:55.241 --> 19:56.689
- Teach your dog
to stop eating

19:56.758 --> 19:58.068
<i>- Right?</i>

19:58.137 --> 19:59.827
- Let's go, go, go, go, go, go.

19:59.896 --> 20:01.551
<i>- I think that sometimes</i>

20:01.620 --> 20:06.068
overreacting about the pig
is not the answer.

20:06.137 --> 20:08.862
- There's pig poop
all over the yard.

20:08.931 --> 20:11.586
- Yeah, let's just pick up
the pig poop, it's okay, y'all.

20:11.655 --> 20:14.379
- I can't deal with that
while I'm pregnant, y'know?

20:14.448 --> 20:17.068
Like, either Aimee
picks up the pig poop,

20:17.137 --> 20:20.965
or the pig stays in one area
and Ravioli stays in one area.

20:21.034 --> 20:24.034
I don't know,
but this is stressing me out.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.413
- Oh, man, let's see
how much this pig

20:29.482 --> 20:32.896
- I got the big ol' one
that was over there.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.620
- I'm just about
to send my pig home.

20:34.689 --> 20:36.172
<i>I can't spend</i>

20:36.241 --> 20:40.275
my whole entire day outside
picking up pig

20:40.344 --> 20:41.896
<i>It's a part of the Earth;

20:41.965 --> 20:43.862
It's gonna turn into, like,
manure

20:43.931 --> 20:45.758
and grow a plant.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.206
'Cause I'm not--yeah, I'm
not dealing with this every day.

20:48.275 --> 20:50.758
- We really ain't trying to make
the pregnant woman angry;

20:50.827 --> 20:52.310
we wanna keep her
comfortable and like, yo,

20:52.379 --> 20:54.413

20:54.482 --> 20:55.620

20:55.689 --> 20:57.620
Oh, poop right here,
oh, it's fresh.

20:57.689 --> 20:59.379

20:59.448 --> 21:00.724

21:00.793 --> 21:03.103

- Ugh, barefoot too, sick.

21:03.172 --> 21:04.758

21:04.827 --> 21:07.517

for the dog to eat pig poop

22:29.896 --> 22:32.206
It's actually high in protein.
- Probably.

22:32.275 --> 22:33.965
- Yeah, it's not bad for them.
- But it's a bad habit,

22:34.034 --> 22:36.241

- Yeah.

22:36.310 --> 22:39.827
<i>- It's a dog; that's

22:45.620 --> 22:46.586
It's okay.

22:46.655 --> 22:48.689

22:48.758 --> 22:50.413
maybe we could, like, build,
like,

22:50.482 --> 22:51.965
a bigger fence for him.

22:52.034 --> 22:53.827
So that way they both
have their own area.

22:53.896 --> 22:55.586
Are you fine with him
just being in there?

22:55.655 --> 22:57.241

give me the respect

23:10.241 --> 23:13.103

23:13.172 --> 23:14.551
