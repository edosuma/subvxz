MAN: <i>You shower</i>
<i>with your dog every day.</i>

00:38.205 --> 00:40.072
<i>Do you and your dog use</i>
<i>the same soap?</i>

00:40.074 --> 00:43.242
<i>If so, one of you</i>
<i>is damaging your hair.</i>

00:43.244 --> 00:45.077
Really?
(concerned grunt)

00:45.079 --> 00:48.047
<i>Dial Cross Species</i>
<i>is specially formulated</i>

00:48.049 --> 00:50.049
<i>for both humans and dogs.</i>

00:50.051 --> 00:51.583
<i>You'll like</i>
<i>that it gets you clean.</i>

00:51.585 --> 00:53.185
<i>He'll like</i>
<i>that it smells like beef.</i>

00:53.187 --> 00:55.220
That sounds great!
(knocking)

00:55.222 --> 00:57.923
WOMAN: Jim, are you showering
with the dog again?

00:57.925 --> 00:59.258
What the hell?!

00:59.260 --> 01:00.392
All right, Peter,
I'm leaving.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.327
Bonnie invited me to
the shooting range.

01:02.329 --> 01:03.595
What?

01:03.597 --> 01:06.065
Yeah, Bonnie says
she goes every week.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.567
(yelling)

01:10.904 --> 01:12.271
(panting)

01:12.273 --> 01:15.074
I think next time
you should bring someone else.

01:15.076 --> 01:17.509
Now, you'll be watching Stewie,
and I don't want you just

01:17.511 --> 01:19.244
to prop him up next
to the TV all day.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.046
Take him to
the park.

01:21.048 --> 01:22.214
I want him to get
some fresh air.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.116
Fresh air is bad
for a kid, Lois.

01:24.118 --> 01:25.884
Look at Michael J. Fox.

01:25.886 --> 01:27.086
What?
I don't know.

01:27.088 --> 01:28.754
Peter, you are taking
Stewie to the park.

01:28.756 --> 01:31.190
It'll do you good to spend
some time with your son.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.125
I spend lots of time
with him, Lois.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.294
Just last week,
I took him to the doctor.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.963
Mr. Griffin, you're here
to get your prostate examined?

01:37.965 --> 01:40.099
Yeah, this is me.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.105
Is that your
little one there?

01:46.107 --> 01:49.141
Oh, no, it's-it's just
the way I'm sitting.

01:49.143 --> 01:51.143
Ah, nothing like a day
at the park,

01:51.145 --> 01:54.279
surrounded by overcompensating
divorced dads.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.115
Wow! Look how high
you're going!

01:56.117 --> 01:57.916
What an amazing day this is!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.318
(laughs)

01:59.320 --> 02:01.553
Is Mommy spending
$2,500 a month on you?

02:01.555 --> 02:03.789
Because that's what
I'm sending Mommy!

02:03.791 --> 02:05.991
Oh, my God,
it's only been five minutes,

02:05.993 --> 02:09.027
and I'm already bored
out of my mind.

02:11.297 --> 02:13.532
Damn, I wish I could go
to the Clam.

02:15.568 --> 02:19.471
Aah! Well, I guess
I see those guys all the time.

02:23.343 --> 02:25.144
A clown?!
Eh, well, I guess

02:25.146 --> 02:27.579
what's the big deal, huh?
It's just one.

02:34.120 --> 02:37.789
Oh, I was quite sure it was just
one from the size of the car!

02:37.791 --> 02:39.191
(phone ringing)
Hello?

02:39.193 --> 02:40.359
QUAGMIRE:
Peter, where the hell are you?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.693
You got to get down
to the Clam, man.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.328
There's, like,
60 clowns in here.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.030
Ugh, I can't.
I got to watch Stewie.

02:45.032 --> 02:48.300
JOE:
Peter, they threw what I thought
was a bucket of water on me,

02:48.302 --> 02:51.370
but it turns out,
it was just a bunch of confetti!

02:51.372 --> 02:53.372
Oh, man, I got
to get over there!

02:53.374 --> 02:55.174
(phone beeps off)

02:58.378 --> 03:01.947
Okay, okay. It's okay
as long as I can still see him.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.615
Okay, Stewie, there you are.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.217
There you are, safe and sound.

03:05.219 --> 03:07.386
Daddy can still see you.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.822
Okay, Daddy
can still see you.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.292
Daddy can still see you.

03:19.232 --> 03:22.367
Daddy can still see you.

03:32.679 --> 03:37.082
That was a wink, but you don't
know it 'cause it's just a eye.

03:40.420 --> 03:42.988
MAN (over TV):
We now return to <i>Superman.</i>

03:42.990 --> 03:44.756
(all crying)

03:44.758 --> 03:46.391
Lois, what's wrong?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.260
Clark, we all have
breast cancer!

03:48.262 --> 03:51.063
The doctor says it's as if
our breasts have been X-rayed

03:51.065 --> 03:54.433
five hours a day, every day,
for the last three years!

03:54.435 --> 03:56.401
Oh, my God,
that's terrible.

03:56.403 --> 03:59.238
First, every woman I've ever
known, and now you guys.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.872
(sighs):
Ah!

04:00.874 --> 04:03.442
Boy, it was smart
to wait out that thunderstorm.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.711
(phone ringing)
Aah, it's Lois!

04:05.713 --> 04:07.412
Oh, my God! Stewie!

04:07.414 --> 04:09.114
Oh, uh, hey, Lois.

04:09.116 --> 04:10.382
H-Hey, it's hard to hear you

04:10.384 --> 04:12.584
over the sound
of joyful children in the park.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.220
LOIS: Are you and Stewie
having a good time?

04:15.222 --> 04:16.288
Uh, uh, yeah.

04:16.290 --> 04:17.923
Okay, well, let me talk to him.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.259
I want to tell him
Mommy's on her way home.

04:20.261 --> 04:21.927
She wants to talk to Stewie.
What do I do?!

04:21.929 --> 04:24.363
Here, give me the phone.
I do a great Stewie.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.465
Hey, Lois,
it's me, the baby.

04:26.467 --> 04:29.368
Hi, Stewie. I'm on my way home.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.736
Mommy misses you.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.237
All right, cool.

04:32.239 --> 04:34.373
Bring some beef
jerky maybe.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.609
I just bought
you ten minutes.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.544
Stewie?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.952
Oh, there's my boy.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.889
Hey, what happened
to my new friend,

04:50.891 --> 04:53.292
that kid who sort of
looks like me from behind?

04:53.294 --> 04:55.394
Wait. Where's the fat man?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.429
(siren wailing in distance)

04:57.431 --> 04:59.464
Well, I guess this is it.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.899
I'm gonna die here.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.401
I'll never get to grow old

05:02.403 --> 05:04.336
and become an across-the-country
grandparent.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.138
What is this?

05:06.140 --> 05:07.506
WOMAN:
It's a Skype.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.508
A Snyke?
No, a Skype.

05:09.510 --> 05:10.642
Snype?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.845
No, it's a Skype...
from your grandson.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.347
Stephen?

05:15.349 --> 05:18.317
Yes! He's right there
trying to say hi to you.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.685
What movie is this?

05:19.687 --> 05:21.486
It's not a movie.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.121
It's your grandson!

05:23.123 --> 05:25.190
My grandson is in the pictures?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.326
You did this yesterday!

05:27.328 --> 05:28.460
Don't holler at me!

05:28.462 --> 05:30.162
I don't understand anything!

05:30.164 --> 05:31.930
I'm very frightened!

05:31.932 --> 05:34.533
(tires screech)

05:35.301 --> 05:36.335
Wait a minute.

05:36.337 --> 05:39.371
Stewie, what happened
to your head?

05:39.373 --> 05:40.872
Oh, you're not Stewie.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.542
I got to get you back
to the park and find...

05:46.179 --> 05:47.846
(gasps)

05:51.517 --> 05:53.485
All right, kid,
your name is Stewie, all right?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.986
I'm your new dad.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.456
My name is Peter,
and I work at the brewer...

05:57.458 --> 06:00.359
NASA. I work at NASA.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.828
Uh, hey, Lois.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.897
You look fat. You
should go for a run.
Peter!

06:05.899 --> 06:08.233
I'm gonna go give my
baby a kiss good night.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.503
Uh, Lois, I had an affair, and
I think we should talk about it!

06:11.505 --> 06:15.073
Peter, jamming yourself into
a grapefruit is not an affair.

06:19.245 --> 06:22.214
See? There's a human baby
in there.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.249
Asleep in Stewie's overalls.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.251
Peter, please get
out of my way!

06:26.253 --> 06:27.486
Aah!

06:27.488 --> 06:28.587
BABY:
Aah!
Aah!

06:28.589 --> 06:29.421
(doorbell rings)

06:29.423 --> 06:31.790
Great. We woke up the doorbell.

06:32.658 --> 06:34.426
I think there was
a mix-up at the park.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.661
(gasps)
My little Stewie!

06:36.663 --> 06:38.196
Oh, Jacob!

06:38.198 --> 06:40.265
Wh-Where's your little hat?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.433
He didn't have a hat.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.034
Oh, I am so sorry.

06:43.036 --> 06:44.436
I just got
home myself.

06:44.438 --> 06:45.837
I left my husband in charge,

06:45.839 --> 06:48.440
which was obviously
a terrible mistake.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.443
Thank you so much.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.578
I took a bath
with the dad.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.847
Mmm. Oh, my baby's
back home.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.282
Mommy missed you.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.450
Congratulations, Lois.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.185
You passed the test.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.520
You really do
love Stewie.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.054
Now, what do you
say we all sit down

07:03.056 --> 07:05.424
and watch this Weird Al
Yankovic documentary?

07:05.426 --> 07:07.859
It's called
<i>An Inconvenient Tooth.</i>

07:07.861 --> 07:10.462
(laughing)
What's wrong
with you, Peter?!

07:10.464 --> 07:11.563
Lois, I'm sorry.

07:11.565 --> 07:13.465
How the hell
can you possibly

07:13.467 --> 07:14.566
mistake another baby
for Stewie?!

07:14.568 --> 07:16.101
Now, calm down, Lois.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.636
You're gonna say
something you don't mean.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.472
Oh, no, I'm not!
You're an idiot!

07:20.474 --> 07:22.474
You don't mean that.

07:22.476 --> 07:24.976
I already got a Facebook
friend request from the dad.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.545
Is that weird?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.713
Peter, I have put up
with your nonsense for 20 years,

07:28.715 --> 07:30.615
but today
you crossed a line.

07:30.617 --> 07:32.617
You left a helpless baby
in a public park.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.687
And that's something
only an idiot would do!

07:36.456 --> 07:38.623
I'm <i>not</i> an idiot.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.459
(knocking)

07:40.461 --> 07:43.728
Hey, I think
there was a mix-up at the park.

07:50.670 --> 07:52.804
MAN (over TV): We now return
to <i>The Karate Kid,</i>

07:52.806 --> 07:54.639
with realistic human feelings.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.508
You're all
right, LaRusso!
(crowd cheering)

07:56.510 --> 07:59.444
(bleep) You just tried
to cripple me!

07:59.446 --> 08:00.912
(sighs)

08:00.914 --> 08:03.582
I hate to sound like every
woman ever, but I'm depressed.

08:03.584 --> 08:05.016
Don't engage.
Don't engage.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.351
Why?
Damn it!

08:06.353 --> 08:08.019
Lois called
me an idiot.
So?

08:08.021 --> 08:10.622
So, I don't tell her all the
bad things about herself.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.657
Like how the mole on her back

08:12.659 --> 08:14.526
is changing shape and
size really quickly.

08:14.528 --> 08:16.661
Being dumb isn't
the worst thing, Peter.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.330
At least you're not
two foreign guys

08:18.332 --> 08:20.665
talking too loud
in the next booth.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.667
Much sorry, friend!

08:22.669 --> 08:24.970
Man, there are
no womens here.

08:24.972 --> 08:28.340
We've got to make like '70s
rock man Garrett and leave.

08:28.342 --> 08:29.708
You said it, Belgard.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.676
Looks like you and me
will have to make hands

08:31.678 --> 08:33.044
on each other tonight.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.513
Aah, gross!

08:34.515 --> 08:36.548
(laughs) I was just
playing joke at you!

08:36.550 --> 08:38.650
Ah, good one! You
should be comedy writer.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.118
Too late, friend.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.354
I already have
comedy development at CBS.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.688
Oh, nice!

08:43.690 --> 08:45.390
CBS knows real situations

08:45.392 --> 08:47.158
I want to see
for 100 episodes!

08:47.160 --> 08:50.195
Thanks. My hysterical
multi-camera show is called

08:50.197 --> 08:52.664
<i>Wizard Robot and His</i>
<i>Less Successful Friend.</i>

08:52.666 --> 08:55.634
Oh, man, you know
what America wants.

08:55.636 --> 08:57.636
All right, fine, so
I'm a dumb, hot guy.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.204
All right? There's
worse things to be.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.072
Okay, we're only gonna
tackle one thing today.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.575
Peter, maybe you need to
broaden your horizons, you know?

09:03.577 --> 09:04.743
Read a book, travel.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.545
Oh, yeah, I love traveling.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.579
You see new things,

09:07.581 --> 09:09.414
inconvenience thousands
of people.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.016
You know what?
You guys are right.

09:11.018 --> 09:14.085
It's time to travel, to learn,
to experience new things.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.421
I've been letting opportunities
pass me by

09:16.423 --> 09:18.089
ever since I was a kid.

09:19.358 --> 09:22.761
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.897
No, my mom says I shouldn't.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.704
(crying)

09:32.706 --> 09:36.775
Hey, kid, get in my van, and
I'll give you some candy.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.843
Okay!

09:46.586 --> 09:49.621
Stella, I need you to go
to Chicago on Thursday.

09:49.623 --> 09:53.758
I can't. This week
is the Deaf Games.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.927
(bell clanging)

09:57.697 --> 09:59.698
(bell continues clanging)

09:59.700 --> 10:01.766
Oh, my God, this has been
a 12-minute round.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.703
Why does every fight
have to go to the death?

10:04.705 --> 10:05.870
Angela, if you got
business traveling

10:05.872 --> 10:08.139
that needs to be done,
I'm your guy.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.641
Griffin, I'm not
gonna look over there

10:09.643 --> 10:11.977
until you first assure
me you've got pants on.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.813
It's not a rule unless
there's a sign on the wall.

10:14.815 --> 10:16.815
I won that court case.
Fine.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.617
So you'd be willing
to take that trip

10:18.619 --> 10:19.784
to Chicago for
the company?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.620
Yeah, you know,
I was just saying

10:21.622 --> 10:22.654
I need to broaden my horizons.

10:22.656 --> 10:24.422
You see, my wife thinks
I'm an idiot.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.825
She's always making me feel
small and insignificant.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.627
Like John Goodman's
heartbeat.

10:28.629 --> 10:31.162
(heart thumps)

10:31.164 --> 10:34.799
Honey? My inside left boob
stomach did that thing again.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.668
You mean
your heart?

10:36.670 --> 10:38.803
Um, I don't know
about any of that,

10:38.805 --> 10:41.473
but I think
I should eat something.

10:44.677 --> 10:46.845
Well, gentlemen,
thank you for coming.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.813
Mr. Griffin, I believe you
have something for me.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.782
Yes, I do, Mr. Franks.
Terrific.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.784
We were completely
out of these tubes.

10:52.786 --> 10:54.686
Well, thank you all
for coming. Good day.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.688
Nicely done,
Mr. Franks.
Thanks, Chief.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.790
Wait, so that's it?
Hey, you nailed it!

10:58.792 --> 11:00.492
But I'm here till
tomorrow night.

11:00.494 --> 11:01.793
What am I
supposed to do?

11:01.795 --> 11:03.628
Get out there
and explore Chicago, Peter.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.830
It's one of the great cities
of the world.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.633
There's museums,
a symphony, a Lyric Opera.

11:08.635 --> 11:09.701
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.836
Did you say "chicken
fashion show"?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.204
No.
Oh.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.340
But that-that other stuff,
they all sound like

11:15.342 --> 11:19.077
the kind of things I could
do to expand my horizons.

11:20.479 --> 11:21.680
Wow.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.315
Chicago:
"The San Francisco Treat."

11:24.317 --> 11:26.685
I haven't felt this sense
of limitless adventure

11:26.687 --> 11:28.687
since I went cave jumping.

11:28.689 --> 11:30.221
Here we go!

11:30.223 --> 11:34.526
(echoing): I told no one
what I was doing today!

11:38.130 --> 11:42.434
Man, I'm, like, the fifth most
attractive woman in Chicago.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.742
Hi. Welcome
to the museum.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.510
Thanks.
Just to be clear,

11:52.512 --> 11:53.912
I should touch
everything, right?

11:53.914 --> 11:55.380
No, please don't
touch anything.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.716
Sorry, it's my first time
at an adult museum.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.517
I'm used to petting
the starfishes.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.720
Well, maybe you'd find
our audio tour helpful.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.188
You have your choice
of narrators:

12:03.190 --> 12:04.723
our senior curator

12:04.725 --> 12:06.991
or Chicago's own
Dennis Farina.

12:06.993 --> 12:09.194
Hmm.

12:09.196 --> 12:11.696
FARINA: Hey there, chief.
Dennis Farina here.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.264
And welcome to our museum.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.735
Just so you know, I'll be
eating through most of this.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.837
Yeah. This one.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.773
FARINA:
(chewing) Ah, man,

12:21.775 --> 12:23.708
that's good sausage.
(burps)

12:23.710 --> 12:24.743
Oops. Excuse me.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.945
Anyways, this is
<i>At the Moulin Rouge</i>

12:26.947 --> 12:28.580
by Toulouse-Lautrec.

12:28.582 --> 12:30.215
Uh, it's from the 1890s.

12:30.217 --> 12:34.452
Now, he was a midge,
but he painted like a normal.

12:36.188 --> 12:39.858
Now, here is a naked chick
made completely out of marble.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.760
I got to wonder--
I'm sure you do, too--

12:41.762 --> 12:44.963
how this thing didn't crack
when they were carving out

12:44.965 --> 12:46.798
her downstairs business.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.768
(loudly): He did a great job
with the vagina.

12:49.770 --> 12:52.771
Here's a picture
by this guy Salvador Dalí.

12:52.773 --> 12:56.141
This guy, I'm telling you,
was a freakin' whack-a-doodle.

12:56.143 --> 12:59.778
Wow, who knew you could learn
so much at a museum?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.312
And this is only Chicago.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.982
From now on, I'm gonna volunteer
for every business trip,

13:03.984 --> 13:06.785
and see all the great stuff
that's out there.

MAN (over TV): We now return
to Janeane Garofalo

14:08.882 --> 14:11.883
and Mark Ruffalo
in <i>Garofaruffalo.</i>

14:11.885 --> 14:12.884
Turn it off, Chris.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.053
I don't even want to know
what that is.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.455
Your father
has returned.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.890
Dad!
Oh, Peter!

14:18.892 --> 14:20.725
How were all your
business trips?

14:20.727 --> 14:22.293
Oh, exemplary, Chris.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.963
I don't understand what
either of those words mean.

14:24.965 --> 14:26.865
One of them
was "Chris."

14:26.867 --> 14:29.300
Peter, you seem...
different.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.337
That's right, Lois;
I live the life of the mind now.

14:32.339 --> 14:35.306
My brain is awash
with theorems and profundity

14:35.308 --> 14:38.509
and abstractions that I can
pontificate upon at length.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.311
Brian's a woof-cat!

14:40.313 --> 14:42.213
Peter, you sound
so refined.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.315
Are you...
intelligent now?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.351
Affirmative.
That means "yes."

14:46.353 --> 14:49.053
Does that please you?
It does, Peter.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.321
Well, it should.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.924
After all, knowledge is
the ultimate aphrodisiac.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.893
Shall we away
for relations?

14:54.895 --> 14:58.263
I'm not sure what you're
saying, but let's hump!

14:58.265 --> 15:00.231
PETER (panting):
Affirmative, affirmative,

15:00.233 --> 15:03.101
affirmative...
Oh, my God, affirmative!

15:03.103 --> 15:05.503
LOIS:
Wow, Peter, that was great!

15:05.505 --> 15:08.072
PETER:
It was. Sorry I "arrived" early.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.440
LOIS:
That's okay.

15:09.442 --> 15:10.909
PETER:
And sorry about the bedspread.

15:10.911 --> 15:13.978
That was about
a week's worth of arrive.

15:20.886 --> 15:24.022
Mom, Dad, the TV's broken!

15:24.024 --> 15:26.190
Actually, Chris,
I got rid of our television.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.760
This is our new bookshelf,
and I think you'll find

15:28.762 --> 15:31.963
it has more channels than
any TV we've ever owned.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.765
I want to watch
<i>The Walking Dead!</i>

15:33.767 --> 15:37.268
Then I shall read to you from
Mary Shelley's <i>Frankenstein.</i>

15:37.270 --> 15:38.970
I want to watch
<i>New Girl.</i>

15:38.972 --> 15:40.605
Perhaps you'd like to hear
about Jane Eyre,

15:40.607 --> 15:44.742
who felt quite the new girl
at Rochester's Thornfield Hall.

15:44.744 --> 15:46.311
How about
<i>Game of Thrones?</i>

15:46.313 --> 15:48.947
Instead, I shall read
to you from...

15:48.949 --> 15:50.315
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

15:50.317 --> 15:52.550
Oh, finally, another reader
in the family.

15:52.552 --> 15:55.153
You know, these are some of
my favorite books and authors.

15:55.155 --> 15:57.055
Oh? What are you
reading right now?

15:57.057 --> 15:58.323
Oh, boy.
Well, I'm...

15:58.325 --> 16:00.124
I'm sort of between
books right now.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.926
Yeah? What was
the last thing you read?

16:01.928 --> 16:03.428
He's got you on
the ropes now.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.763
I-I'm actually <i>rereading</i>
<i>a lot of stuff.</i>

16:05.765 --> 16:07.632
Yeah? Like what?
Just tap out.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.500
Uh... the classics,
you know?

16:09.502 --> 16:12.170
Going back to the,
uh... basics, really.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.439
(chuckles)
Words on the printed page.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.774
Thank you,
Steve Guttenberg, right?

16:16.776 --> 16:18.009
What is this, oak?

16:18.011 --> 16:19.744
Oh, I don't even
think it's oak!

16:19.746 --> 16:22.814
Peter, I can't get over the way
you've transformed yourself.

16:22.816 --> 16:24.082
How'd you do it?

16:24.084 --> 16:26.150
Well, Lois, some of it
came from books,

16:26.152 --> 16:27.352
some came from museums,

16:27.354 --> 16:30.088
and, honestly, a lot of it
just came from travel.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.256
Hey, excuse me,
I need to rent a car.

16:32.258 --> 16:35.460
Preferably one where
the radio is stuck on NPR.

16:35.462 --> 16:37.195
Here you go.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.033
(softly): Hello.
It's me. I am returning.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.601
How was the car?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.003
Coastal and superior.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.038
I never knew whisper-talking
was so smart.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.174
And how will you be paying
for your rental, sir?

16:50.176 --> 16:52.877
I will pay you with stories
of my abusive father

16:52.879 --> 16:54.545
set to dissonant flute.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.680
(playing gentle music)

16:55.682 --> 16:58.149
I was seven when
he first came home drunk.

16:58.151 --> 17:02.553
A child should sleep
on his bed, not under it.

17:05.891 --> 17:07.225
Hey, what are you
listening to?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.060
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm learning Sanskrit.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.895
You know,
an ancient tongue

17:10.897 --> 17:12.897
can be as titillating
as a young one.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.499
Peter, what gives?
Ever since you had

17:14.501 --> 17:16.401
all those business trips,
you've been acting weird.

17:16.403 --> 17:20.038
Pity a man in familiar places
who yet feels like a stranger.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.041
You... you're the dick
who wrote that in the bathroom!

17:23.043 --> 17:26.244
Indeed. Being smart
and cultured is so lonely.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.213
Now I know why Oscar Wilde
turned to alcoholism

17:29.215 --> 17:31.149
and bone inhalation.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.051
Gentlemen, as they
say in Sanskrit,

17:33.053 --> 17:36.054
<i>shubha prabhatam.</i>

17:36.056 --> 17:38.022
(laughs) You know
what's weird?

17:38.024 --> 17:39.424
Shubha Prabhatam
is my porn name.

17:39.426 --> 17:40.691
What?

17:40.693 --> 17:42.527
Yeah, first pet and
street you grew up on.

17:42.529 --> 17:44.896
You had a pet
named Shubha?
Oh, yeah.

17:44.898 --> 17:46.330
Old Shubha was
a tough pooch.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.934
He was feared by everyone up
and down Prabhatam Drive.

17:49.936 --> 17:52.570
You have
a very weird past.

17:55.107 --> 17:57.608
All right, if this is
to be a smart family,

17:57.610 --> 17:59.277
we will have to learn
not to giggle

17:59.279 --> 18:02.080
at smart things that
sound dirty but are not.

18:02.082 --> 18:03.181
Balzac.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.715
(all giggling)

18:04.717 --> 18:06.117
Homo erectus.

18:06.119 --> 18:07.852
(all giggling)

18:07.854 --> 18:09.120
Spotted dick.

18:09.122 --> 18:10.288
(all giggling)

18:10.290 --> 18:13.091
The results have
been disappointing.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.060
I always thought
spotted dick

18:16.062 --> 18:18.763
had something
to do with Morgan Freeman.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.101
MAN (over TV):
We now return to

18:23.103 --> 18:25.736
Wizard Robot
and His Less Successful Friend.

18:25.738 --> 18:29.373
Aah! We're in a real jar
of jam this time, Wizard Robot.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.374
Gip-gop.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.143
I have put too much suds
in this machine

18:32.145 --> 18:33.711
for washing clothes.

18:33.713 --> 18:36.247
And tonight is the night
I meet with other members

18:36.249 --> 18:38.149
of my form twelve
learning mates

18:38.151 --> 18:41.652
to celebrate the exactly
two groupings of ten years ago.

18:41.654 --> 18:42.987
Gip-gop.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.722
(beeping)

18:44.724 --> 18:46.290
Oh, excellent!

18:46.292 --> 18:48.159
The situation
has abated itself.

18:48.161 --> 18:49.393
Let us leave the room

18:49.395 --> 18:52.663
where no comedic situation
will soon take place.

18:54.466 --> 18:57.668
(enthusiastic audience laughter)

18:57.670 --> 19:01.973
ROBOT VOICE: <i>Wizard Robot and</i>
<i>His Less Successful Friend.</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:03.941
(audience cheering)

19:03.943 --> 19:05.576
Hi, Lois.
No, I wasn't!

19:05.578 --> 19:07.578
Oh, Brian, thank God
it's just you.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.747
You know how Peter
thinks TV rots the mind.

19:09.749 --> 19:12.517
Oh, as long as you're here, can
you run some vocabulary with me?

19:12.519 --> 19:14.986
I need to know how to use
these words in sentences

19:14.988 --> 19:16.187
by the time
Peter gets home.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.356
Oh, that should be easy.
Just give me the word,

19:18.358 --> 19:20.258
and I'll put it in
a sentence for you.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.692
"Anodyne."

19:21.694 --> 19:25.830
Uh... a friend asked me
what "anodyne" means.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.265
Oh, who am I kidding?

19:27.267 --> 19:29.267
I'm never gonna learn
any of these words.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.135
(groans) I can't take
this anymore, Brian,

19:31.137 --> 19:32.203
and the kids
can't either.

19:32.205 --> 19:33.838
Peter's become
a nightmare.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.174
Wait, I thought this was
what you always wanted--

19:36.176 --> 19:37.942
for Peter not to be
an idiot.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.310
Oh, at least that Peter was fun

19:39.312 --> 19:41.179
and didn't make me
feel so stupid.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.314
I miss the old Peter.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.849
Well, we got
to do something,

19:44.851 --> 19:47.218
'cause this new Peter
just sounds all wrong.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.220
Like a pilot
without a calming voice.

19:49.222 --> 19:51.355
(electronic bell dings)
PILOT (screaming): We've now

19:51.357 --> 19:52.857
reached our cruising altitude!

19:52.859 --> 19:55.660
If you look out the window,
you'll see the Rocky Mountains!

19:55.662 --> 19:56.861
(all screaming)

19:56.863 --> 19:59.297
We have to get
out of here!

19:59.299 --> 20:01.032
(all screaming)

20:01.034 --> 20:02.533
Wait a minute.

20:02.535 --> 20:05.236
If visiting San Francisco and
New York made Peter smart,

20:05.238 --> 20:07.738
maybe if we send him
to the dumbest city

20:07.740 --> 20:10.408
in the whole country, it'll
bring back the old Peter.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.144
Huh. It's worth a try.

20:16.982 --> 20:18.549
Aloha!

20:18.551 --> 20:19.884
(laughing)

20:19.886 --> 20:22.153
(grunting, laughter)

20:28.193 --> 20:30.061
Is Peter home?
He's pulling in now.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.829
I sure hope Tucson helped.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.098
Heads up, guys.
I farted on the doorstep,

20:34.100 --> 20:35.399
but it's hot
on my trail.

20:35.401 --> 20:38.035
Oh, Brian,
that's a good sign.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.037
How was your trip?
Oh, amazing.

20:40.039 --> 20:43.074
I saw a wet T-shirt contest
using chocolate milk.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.042
It was at
the Tucson Philharmonic.

20:45.044 --> 20:46.277
What else did you do?

20:46.279 --> 20:47.278
Eh, mostly just picked
my desert boogers.

20:47.280 --> 20:49.447
Oh, Peter, you're back!
Thank God!

20:49.449 --> 20:50.915
We all owe that trash city
a debt of gratitude.

20:50.917 --> 20:55.286
Did you know <i>Battleship</i>
<i>is still in theaters there?</i>

20:55.288 --> 20:58.122
