01:09.040 --> 01:11.270
Yes! My high score!

01:12.680 --> 01:14.079
Champion!

01:32.800 --> 01:33.800
Oi.

01:34.880 --> 01:36.791
Where do you think
you're going, young man?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.792
Rome. I'm going to hold
my breath at the Olympics.

01:40.680 --> 01:41.680
Hmm.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.912
You better take this then,
hadn't you?

01:48.040 --> 01:49.189
Put your medals in.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.270
Thanks, Mum.
I gotta get going.

01:52.680 --> 01:54.193
Have fun.

02:01.280 --> 02:03.077
- Terry?
- What?

02:03.200 --> 02:05.270
He's off to the
Olympics again.

02:30.960 --> 02:31.960
Oi.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.994
You gone mad?

02:35.160 --> 02:37.355
I told Mum I'm going
to the Olympics.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.432
I held my breath
for nearly 58 seconds.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.389
Really? Well,
I tell you what.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.872
Why don't you
jump in the van

02:45.960 --> 02:47.916
and then me and you can hold
our breath all the way home?

02:48.000 --> 02:49.831
That's about a minute away.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.357
Eddie, look, all this
Olympic medal stuff,

02:53.440 --> 02:55.237
it's driving me
a bit mad, mate.

02:55.360 --> 02:57.430
Look at me. I'm driving about
in the middle of the night,

02:57.520 --> 03:00.193
dark, freezing cold,
looking for you.

03:00.320 --> 03:02.675
When I should be
at home doing what?

03:02.800 --> 03:04.950
Watching
It's A Knockout, Dad?

03:05.120 --> 03:06.269
Yeah.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.079
<i>They're
carrying a tremendous log.</i>

03:09.160 --> 03:10.479
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

03:10.600 --> 03:12.477
<i>Hurry up. Hurry up.</i>

03:13.160 --> 03:16.436
Marbles one week,
holding your breath the next.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.955
When is it all
gonna end, young man?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.357
When I become
an Olympian.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.271
Oh. I see.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.708
Say goodnight
to your dad.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.869
Night, Dad.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.158
Night-night, son.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.030
Night, Mum.
Night, love.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.311
That's good
flexibility.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.355
Great. Now, could you just
maybe flex your toes?

03:43.480 --> 03:44.879
That's point your
toes towards you.

03:44.960 --> 03:46.678
Good boy, thank you.

03:46.800 --> 03:48.552
Now, you've got
to take it easy.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.230
Don't do any
climbing up trees

03:51.320 --> 03:53.788
and too much running around.
All right?

03:54.320 --> 03:55.719
His knees are
still healing.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.153
Okay.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.319
Feel okay?

04:07.480 --> 04:09.311
Good. Well done.

04:37.400 --> 04:38.400
Ow!

04:46.200 --> 04:47.952
Right, that's it!

04:50.120 --> 04:52.714
Listen, enough is enough!

04:52.800 --> 04:54.791
It's never bloody
ending with you, son.

04:55.480 --> 04:56.920
Now you're gonna
come to work with me

04:56.960 --> 04:58.871
and you're gonna learn to plaster.
All right?

04:58.960 --> 05:00.837
At least it might
keep you out of trouble.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.229
What about
my Olympic preparations?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.311
Eddie! You are
not an athlete!

05:16.280 --> 05:18.032
Morning, Tel.
All right, Shirley?

05:18.120 --> 05:20.315
Now, today I shall
be finishing off

05:20.400 --> 05:21.913
an arctic stipple.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.274
What did I just say?

05:23.400 --> 05:24.594
Raspberry ripple?

05:24.760 --> 05:27.797
No, not a raspberry ripple.
An arctic stipple.

05:27.920 --> 05:30.070
Which is my
piece de resistance.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.837
My plasterer's
trademark that you

05:34.920 --> 05:37.593
shall spend all day
learning, young man.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.830
Dad, you're a genius.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.912
Oh, where's he gone now?

05:44.080 --> 05:47.311
You're right, I'm never gonna go
to the Olympics.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.113
I'm gonna go
to the Winter Olympics.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.753
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

06:59.840 --> 07:01.592
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you...

07:01.680 --> 07:03.591
...the Head of the
British Winter Olympics

07:03.680 --> 07:06.990
Selection Committee,
Mr. Dustin Target.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.672
Thank you, George.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.797
Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.110
Thank you so much
for being here...

07:17.240 --> 07:19.674
...on this glorious day
for British sport.

07:20.200 --> 07:23.510
You have entered
a new era for business...

07:23.600 --> 07:27.957
...just as we have embarked
on a new era for sport.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.354
Today it is my honor...

07:33.200 --> 07:35.873
...and privilege,
to present to you...

07:36.200 --> 07:39.431
...the 14 young men
who are all candidates

07:39.560 --> 07:41.869
for the British Olympic
Downhill Team.

07:42.440 --> 07:45.876
Vying for your sponsorship
and support...

07:46.040 --> 07:47.951
...in achieving
their dreams...

07:49.920 --> 07:54.277
...to reach the 1988
Winter Games in Calgary.

07:57.080 --> 07:59.150
It's an opportunity
that requires

07:59.240 --> 08:00.878
a new kind of athlete...

08:01.560 --> 08:04.711
...and you deserve the best...

08:05.080 --> 08:07.071
...in return.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.915
All right. Sorry. No, okay.
Hands up, that was my fault.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.000
I'm sorry, fellas.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.072
George. George.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.911
Uh... More champagne, anyone?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.754
Edwards, you've um...
You've made quite an impact today.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.159
Oh, good,
I was trying to.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.434
Yes. Um...

08:27.680 --> 08:31.355
Look, I think we both
know that you've gone...

08:31.760 --> 08:34.433
...as far as you can go
with the squad.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.793
We shan't be selecting
you for the trials, I'm afraid.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.113
But, um, keep up
with the training.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.989
Aim for the
'92 Olympics.

08:46.120 --> 08:47.520
Mr. Target, that's
in 5 years' time.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.828
I'm ready now.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.598
Um,
no, you're not.

08:50.880 --> 08:52.313
You know, I've got
run times just as good

08:52.440 --> 08:54.158
as any of that lot.
Yeah, well...

08:54.960 --> 08:56.871
It's not all about speed.

08:57.840 --> 09:00.115
It's about what school
you went to, is it?

09:01.560 --> 09:03.198
Frankly, Eddie...

09:04.480 --> 09:08.189
...you will never be
Olympic material.

09:11.800 --> 09:12.835
Goodbye.

09:22.080 --> 09:25.231
You wanna
get yourself qualified.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.195
I mean it's not exactly
a career, is it? Skiing.

09:30.640 --> 09:33.473
I mean, how much does a
downhill skier earn? Huh?

09:33.560 --> 09:36.154
What's the take-home pay after tax?
Hmm?

09:36.680 --> 09:39.319
Is there a pension?
I doubt it very much.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.311
Get yourself qualified
for something useful, Eddie.

09:43.400 --> 09:44.992
Yeah, all right, Dad.

09:45.760 --> 09:47.239
I get the point.

09:48.840 --> 09:49.989
You've been banging on
about it since I've been

09:50.080 --> 09:52.514
out of nappies.
Sign me up.

09:56.520 --> 09:57.919
Good lad.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.033
Good lad.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.191
Made you
a nice cup of tea.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.513
Thanks, Mum.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.238
No more downhill, then?

10:25.200 --> 10:26.918
Not exactly
a career, is it?

10:27.920 --> 10:29.592
Not even for fun?

10:31.960 --> 10:32.960
No.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.553
It's about time
I started paying my way.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.229
Well, you better
bring those

10:42.320 --> 10:43.469
dirty overalls down,
then, hadn't you?

10:43.560 --> 10:45.280
For the wash,
'cause you're gonna need them.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.910
<i>Ski-jumping
is probably the most</i>

11:15.000 --> 11:18.356
<i>spectacular of all
the alpine disciplines.</i>

11:18.480 --> 11:21.790
<i>A majestic,
gravity defying mix of power...</i>

11:21.920 --> 11:24.832
<i>...balance
and dare-devil courage.</i>

11:24.960 --> 11:27.315
<i>And more than a few bruises.</i>

11:27.960 --> 11:31.669
<i>As Icarus and Sir Isaac
Newton both discovered...</i>

11:31.800 --> 11:34.997
<i>...what goes up
must come down.</i>

11:44.960 --> 11:46.996
<i>In the world famous
training camp</i>

11:47.120 --> 11:48.553
<i>at Garmisch in Germany...</i>

11:48.640 --> 11:51.552
<i>...you will find
the world's elite ski-jumpers.</i>

11:51.680 --> 11:54.592
<i>...such as the Flying Finn,
Matti Nykanen,</i>

11:54.680 --> 11:56.989
<i>showing how it's really done.</i>

12:13.680 --> 12:15.557
I hate
to disappoint you but, um...

12:15.640 --> 12:18.712
...we haven't got an
Olympic ski-jumping squad.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.638
Not even a small one?

12:20.840 --> 12:22.717
No. Last...

12:23.680 --> 12:26.319
No, Britain hasn't had
a ski-jumper since...

12:28.000 --> 12:29.672
...1929.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.470
Here we go.
Hector Mooney.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.030
Yes, with a distance of
22.9 meters.

12:38.840 --> 12:41.718
And there's no plans for a
team in the near future?

12:41.840 --> 12:44.877
Well, not unless Mr. Mooney
comes out of retirement.

12:45.560 --> 12:48.028
But he died
in 1975 so, no.

12:49.880 --> 12:51.233
That is a shame.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.351
Mum, where's my
purple rucksack?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.192
Under the stairs.
Thank you.

13:05.200 --> 13:07.191
Why? Are you
going camping?

13:07.880 --> 13:10.075
No. Going to Germany.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.791
Coach leaving very soon.

13:15.240 --> 13:16.240
Oi.

13:19.240 --> 13:21.196
What about your
City & Guilds, son?

13:23.640 --> 13:26.108
Sorry, Dad,
I've gotta get on them slopes.

13:26.440 --> 13:28.590
Oh, no.
Not this again, no.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.879
Excuse me.

13:32.080 --> 13:35.868
Hang on. What am I gonna tell
your plastering teacher?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.120
Tell him I've
made new plans.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.549
New plans?
What plans?

13:40.440 --> 13:42.954
I'm gonna be
an Olympic ski-jumper.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.391
No. No.

13:50.800 --> 13:52.916
This is some kind
of joke, right?

13:53.080 --> 13:55.355
Dad, it's not like
I'm taking up ballet.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.072
It's still skiing.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.952
It's just a bit higher.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.594
You name me one,
one British ski-jumper.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.835
Me.

14:03.160 --> 14:04.798
Eddie Edwards.

14:04.920 --> 14:06.592
I'm gonna be the squad.

14:07.800 --> 14:11.509
And who's gonna pay
for all this? Eh?

14:11.600 --> 14:13.477
I'm not having your mother
put through all that again.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.192
We had bailiffs
knocking on the door,

14:15.280 --> 14:17.475
all hours of the day,
taking away the sofa.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.079
And it's because of you,
by the way,

14:19.160 --> 14:21.276
that I'm driving
my campervan to work.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.713
They're dirty.
Yeah, I know.

14:22.840 --> 14:24.353
We haven't had a holiday
in three years, son,

14:24.440 --> 14:26.431
and your mother,
she loves Blackpool.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.078
I don't like
Blackpool, Terry.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.275
Dad.

14:29.360 --> 14:31.635
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.797
I'm gonna work it out.

14:37.320 --> 14:38.673
He's gonna break his neck.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.711
Oh, I'm gonna
break his neck.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.951
Do you really wanna put
yourself through this again?

14:53.040 --> 14:55.713
It's a world that
doesn't wanna know you.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.998
So what's new?

14:59.320 --> 15:02.312
Are you trying to tell me you never
had a dream when you were a kid, Dad?

15:02.400 --> 15:05.836
Course I did.
I'm not made of stone, son.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.836
You never said.
What was it?

15:09.320 --> 15:11.311
It was to be a plasterer.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.640
Bye, Dad.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.193
Yeah, bye, son.

16:31.800 --> 16:33.711
You're the Flying Finn.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.150
You're Matti.
I know.

16:40.560 --> 16:42.357
You want an autograph?

16:42.520 --> 16:44.158
Yes, please. Um...

16:48.600 --> 16:50.431
Bus ticket.

16:51.280 --> 16:52.280
No.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.838
Bye, Matti.

18:37.800 --> 18:39.677
What are you doing here?

18:40.880 --> 18:42.233
I'm so sorry,

18:42.320 --> 18:43.753
I didn't have
anywhere to sleep.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.637
An Englishman
sleeping in my cupboard.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.109
Happens a lot.
You know why?

18:49.200 --> 18:51.430
It's the good
German beer...

18:51.560 --> 18:53.516
...and not this
pee-pee water

18:53.600 --> 18:55.591
you're drinking back home.
Am I right?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.468
Well, no, actually.
I don't drink.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.511
So what are
you doing here?

19:00.600 --> 19:02.556
Well, I'm a ski-jumper.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.312
Well, I want
to be a ski-jumper.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.356
I mean, I'm not a ski-jumper
yet but my mum says

19:06.440 --> 19:08.160
I'm a very resourceful,
determined person...

19:08.240 --> 19:09.992
...and I think that with
some time and guidance

19:10.080 --> 19:13.072
I probably will make it
as a ski-jumper.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.752
You're a ski-jumper?

19:14.880 --> 19:16.029
Yeah.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.475
Well, you are not
the first ski-jumper

19:18.560 --> 19:20.676
to wake up in my cupboard.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.671
But, back in the past,

19:22.760 --> 19:25.399
I would have been
in here with you.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.189
Okay.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.513
You have somewhere
to sleep tonight?

19:30.120 --> 19:31.120
Mmm-mmm.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.400
Okay.

19:34.720 --> 19:37.075
You help me in the bar
and I'll let you stay here.

19:37.640 --> 19:39.437
Really?
That would be amazing.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.351
And maybe sometimes

19:41.440 --> 19:43.874
I come and visit you.
Would you like that?

19:46.960 --> 19:48.359
Would you like me
to visit you?

19:48.440 --> 19:49.873
I probably won't be in here that much,
to be honest.

19:50.000 --> 19:54.391
What with all the training
I mentioned and, um... Uh...

19:54.480 --> 19:55.959
Do you have
the key for the...?

19:56.040 --> 19:57.359
I'll get it
off you later.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.232
- Okay. Good luck.
- Yeah.

20:32.640 --> 20:33.789
Yes!

20:34.760 --> 20:36.352
What a doddle.

20:38.360 --> 20:41.113
Right. I think I'm ready
for that bigger one.

21:24.760 --> 21:25.760
Okay.

21:32.320 --> 21:35.118
I've seen worse injuries but,
you know, normally

21:35.200 --> 21:37.475
they come from
the bigger jumps.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.678
Who's your coach?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.875
I've been giving it
a lot of thought

21:42.960 --> 21:44.916
and I'm not sure
I need one.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.996
Bjorn. Hey, Bjorn.
Good to see you.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.838
Norwegian.
He was a good jumper in his time.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.432
Now he's a coach.

21:54.560 --> 21:55.879
He's a coach?

21:56.000 --> 21:57.228
Mmm-hmm. I think so.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.192
With the beard?

22:00.720 --> 22:02.995
Yes, the one... Yeah.
And the blond hair?

22:05.000 --> 22:06.433
Thank you, Petra.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.315
Hello?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.278
Hiya, fellas,
I'm Eddie Edwards.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.272
I'm Great Britain.
Oh God. Nude. Um...

22:17.360 --> 22:19.555
So, basically I...

22:19.920 --> 22:22.480
...I've just started
on the 40 meters

22:22.560 --> 22:24.471
and I'm making
solid progress.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.749
But I just wondered
if I could get

22:25.840 --> 22:28.035
a few bits of advice
and some tips.

22:28.200 --> 22:30.156
How do you land, exactly?

22:32.240 --> 22:33.912
You been jumping long?

22:34.040 --> 22:35.712
Since yesterday afternoon.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.352
I know, I'm already on the 40.
I'm a fast learner.

22:49.880 --> 22:51.518
How old are you?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.792
I'm 22.
Hmm...

22:54.400 --> 22:56.675
In Norway, the time
to be starting jumping

22:56.760 --> 22:59.433
is when you are
six years old.

22:59.560 --> 23:01.551
Six years old.
Yeah.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.553
Or younger.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.273
No. You're a bit too late,
Mr. Britain man.

23:09.680 --> 23:10.715
Mmm...

23:12.840 --> 23:14.398
Yes, okay.

23:14.480 --> 23:16.869
Well, there's a lot to be
thinking about there so...

23:17.040 --> 23:19.508
...I'm gonna
just get to it.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.434
Okay.

23:21.720 --> 23:23.915
Stupid Englishman.

23:25.080 --> 23:27.640
I bet he's dead by the weekend.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.552
No messing about this time.

24:10.640 --> 24:11.914
Let's do it.

24:38.080 --> 24:39.752
Whoa!

25:12.120 --> 25:13.269
Ah!

25:27.280 --> 25:28.872
So, you're
the mystery elf

25:28.960 --> 25:31.030
who's been hacking up
my slope, huh?

25:31.120 --> 25:32.917
Just you? No pickaxe?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.958
You do realize
the time to start jumping

25:35.040 --> 25:36.109
is when you're
five or six?

25:36.240 --> 25:37.240
Thanks.

25:38.000 --> 25:39.956
The Norwegians
already told me that.

25:40.040 --> 25:42.679
Did they also tell you you
look ridiculous in that gear?

25:43.400 --> 25:45.277
At least I'm wearing a jacket.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.628
This is my jacket, pal.

25:46.720 --> 25:47.789
Maybe you should
wear one, too.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.478
No. Drinking doesn't
agree with me.

25:49.560 --> 25:51.073
Neither does ski-jumping.

25:51.160 --> 25:53.435
Yeah, well, when I want advice
on how to drunkenly plow snow,

25:53.520 --> 25:54.953
I'll look you up.

25:56.400 --> 25:58.470
Don't even think about
doing the 70 meter.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.240
I don't want to have to clean up
your mess when you break your neck.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.669
Whatever.

26:02.760 --> 26:04.398
What would you know
about it, anyway?

26:07.240 --> 26:08.958
Get off my slope.

26:20.000 --> 26:21.115
Bronson Peary.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.033
Interstate youth
champion 1968.

26:24.160 --> 26:27.516
Then the Olympic Squad
under Warren Sharp.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.713
The Warren Sharp?

26:29.800 --> 26:31.870
Yeah.
The great American coach.

26:31.960 --> 26:34.155
Peary was his star jumper.
He broke records.

26:34.400 --> 26:36.118
He was really
a gifted flyer

26:36.240 --> 26:39.232
with a very
special style. But...

26:39.960 --> 26:42.190
...he was too crazy,
you know?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.515
And now he's just crazy,
but in a different way.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.631
Bronson Peary. How come
I've never heard of him?

26:46.760 --> 26:48.398
They kicked him out.

26:48.520 --> 26:50.112
What for?

26:50.240 --> 26:53.710
Arrogance. Bad discipline.
Drunkenness. Fornication.

26:53.960 --> 26:57.077
What you probably call
"being a total loser."

26:58.040 --> 26:59.712
Definitely him.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.076
Petra, do you mind
if I borrow this?

27:03.320 --> 27:05.709
Yeah, take it.
Okay, thanks.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.593
I thought we could
have a little chat about

27:11.680 --> 27:13.955
me being an
Olympic ski-jumper.

27:14.040 --> 27:16.160
You've more chance of being
a ballerina than a jumper.

27:16.880 --> 27:18.359
Good one.

27:18.440 --> 27:20.271
I was just after
a few tips, really.

27:20.360 --> 27:21.873
Give up,
there's one for free.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.192
Petra told me
you used to jump for America.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.988
Yeah, Petra has
a lot of stories, man.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.589
She gave me
this book, actually,

27:29.680 --> 27:31.830
by your old coach
Warren Sharp.

27:35.280 --> 27:36.554
Where's my jacket?

27:45.360 --> 27:46.759
For as long as
I can remember,

27:46.840 --> 27:48.990
it has been my ambition
to become an Olympian.

27:49.880 --> 27:50.880
What?

27:51.000 --> 27:52.433
Olympics.

27:52.520 --> 27:54.909
Britain doesn't have a ski-jumping
team so I was thinking...

27:55.000 --> 27:57.912
Okay. Now I know
you're crazy.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.513
Look, I know we didn't get
off to the best of starts...

28:01.600 --> 28:03.158
...but you shouldn't be
fixing rust-buckets.

28:03.240 --> 28:04.309
You should be coaching.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.391
It's a classic
1972 Trans-Am, man.

28:06.520 --> 28:09.034
I'm just saying,
if I had your pedigree and experience...

28:09.120 --> 28:11.156
Yeah, well you don't.
I'm busy.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.316
Okay, I've plateaued.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.594
Without your help,

28:14.680 --> 28:16.113
I don't think
I'm gonna get any better.

28:16.200 --> 28:18.555
Really? Okay. Well, then
you won't get any better.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.755
Right.

28:19.840 --> 28:21.831
I'll come back later.
Don't.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.593
What a lunatic.

28:33.480 --> 28:34.754
Wanna see how
it's really done?

28:34.840 --> 28:37.513
Watch this guy.
Number 2 in the world.

29:05.080 --> 29:09.232
And he knew what he was doing.
You don't stand a chance.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.712
- Hi, Bronson.
- Oi.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.389
You truly are
a great Olympian.

29:55.640 --> 29:57.995
Always drink milk
when I'm in training.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.877
Calcium. Helps to keep
the bones strong.

29:59.960 --> 30:01.837
Right, yeah.
What do you think, Petra?

30:01.920 --> 30:03.319
Good-looking
boy like this,

30:03.400 --> 30:05.550
he shouldn't be crashing
into mountains.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.676
He should be
crashing into ladies.

30:07.760 --> 30:09.034
Hey, hey, be nice.

30:09.160 --> 30:11.441
Never really been my specialty
if I'm completely honest...

30:11.480 --> 30:13.789
Really? Never would
have guessed, man.

30:14.320 --> 30:16.390
Hey, you still
looking for pointers?

30:17.800 --> 30:19.233
It's that way
back to England.

30:19.320 --> 30:20.548
Hey, shut it.

30:20.640 --> 30:22.320
Hey, why don't you
order another one?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.991
They have no idea,
do they?

30:31.080 --> 30:32.195
You're the guy
who struck the first

30:32.280 --> 30:33.474
90 meters
at Copper Peak,

30:33.600 --> 30:35.875
with no headwind,
in 1970 Opening Trials,

30:35.960 --> 30:38.713
and they think you're
just some old drunk.

30:39.680 --> 30:40.829
Thanks, I think.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.594
You can learn a lot
from that Warren Sharp's book.

30:43.720 --> 30:45.360
You've been doing
your homework, have you?

30:45.400 --> 30:46.628
I'll cut straight
to the point.

30:46.720 --> 30:49.393
I'm gonna be up bright and breezy
tomorrow morning for some extra training.

30:49.480 --> 30:50.549
No.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.558
So the old drunk is teaching
the English how to jump.

30:53.920 --> 30:55.831
That's fantastic.
Is that milk?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.198
I don't drink alcohol so...

31:00.200 --> 31:03.112
I love it. It's good.
It's too good.

31:03.680 --> 31:06.069
Too good! Yeah.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.077
There's a new team in town!

31:08.200 --> 31:09.428
Hold this for me,
will you?

31:09.520 --> 31:12.353
Milky Boy and
the PistenBully driver!

31:13.200 --> 31:14.758
Hey, don't hurt yourself.

31:14.920 --> 31:16.433
Hey, hey, hey.

31:17.320 --> 31:19.311
My jumpers do not fight.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.913
But I do.

31:23.560 --> 31:24.629
Shit.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.633
Did I win?

31:31.440 --> 31:34.113
Not exactly.
But I got your watch.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.790
Come here, I'm gonna
show you something.

31:42.280 --> 31:45.670
Okay, this is the
Norwegian training camp.

31:46.640 --> 31:49.552
You wanted to get some tips.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.155
Well, here is
how not to do it.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.671
Look at all this crap here.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.798
I mean, what is all this?

31:59.880 --> 32:02.348
They wanna turn
everyone into robots.

32:02.480 --> 32:05.233
They don't understand
the jumping paradox, man.

32:05.400 --> 32:08.312
This is not just a sport,
it's an art.

32:09.080 --> 32:10.991
It's spiritual, man.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.635
You gotta
free your mind first.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.911
You gotta just,
kinda fly, man.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.871
You wanna just fly.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.398
What is the jumping paradox?

32:26.520 --> 32:27.555
The what?

32:27.640 --> 32:30.438
The jumping paradox.
That thing you said a second ago.

32:31.840 --> 32:34.070
Okay. I'm gonna
say this once.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.717
The foundation
of any jump is what?

32:37.800 --> 32:38.800
Take-off.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.029
Very good.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.868
Very good.

32:43.760 --> 32:45.876
The paradox

32:45.960 --> 32:48.474
is simultaneously
stretching up...

32:48.600 --> 32:50.750
...and leaning
into your descent.

32:50.840 --> 32:52.558
It's unnatural

32:52.640 --> 32:54.995
because you actually
take-off downwards. Okay?

32:55.680 --> 32:58.160
Your body has gotta lean forward
in order to give you the lift.

32:58.240 --> 33:00.310
- Like the wing of a bird.
- Just...

33:03.560 --> 33:04.993
Come on, man,
be the wing of a bird.

33:06.440 --> 33:10.035
That's it. So, your skis go up,
your legs go back.

33:10.120 --> 33:11.758
Your body goes forward
and you go down

33:11.840 --> 33:14.877
all while falling through
the air at 70 mph, man.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.911
Up, back, forward.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.400
What are you doing?
I'm just helping.

33:19.440 --> 33:23.877
Up, back, forward, down.
Up, back, forward, down.

33:24.000 --> 33:26.468
Say it.
Up, back, forward, down.

33:26.560 --> 33:27.788
Exactly.

33:29.120 --> 33:30.155
Oh.

33:30.240 --> 33:32.515
Fell in love
with this sport, man.

33:32.600 --> 33:34.079
It started with
this little baby.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.390
This little
15 meter little vixen.

33:36.480 --> 33:37.754
You manage
to land that because

33:37.840 --> 33:39.558
it's meant to hook you
into the sport, right...

33:39.640 --> 33:41.710
...otherwise you wouldn't
even bother trying.

33:41.800 --> 33:42.949
The 40 meter,

33:43.080 --> 33:45.275
when you stack
you get bruised,

33:45.360 --> 33:47.112
which I don't need
to explain to you.

33:49.080 --> 33:50.399
Sorry.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.392
The 70 meter...

33:53.800 --> 33:54.915
...you break bones

33:55.000 --> 33:57.116
and you're lucky
if you can walk again.

33:57.240 --> 34:00.152
The 90 meter.
The goddess.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.313
Let's just say
in the Wild West

34:05.400 --> 34:06.840
we'd be measuring
you for your coffin

34:06.920 --> 34:09.228
before you even
reach the stairs.

34:11.960 --> 34:13.791
Never forget that, kid.

34:21.199 --> 34:23.350
You know what?
Enough talk. It's showtime.

34:24.440 --> 34:25.759
Showtime?

34:37.239 --> 34:39.754
Sorry, mate, I just
need to borrow them.

34:39.840 --> 34:40.840
Oi.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.112
Oh, my God.

34:46.239 --> 34:49.232
Come on!
Spread your wings and die!

35:57.920 --> 35:59.069
Good jump.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.553
Yeah!

36:00.840 --> 36:02.159
Let's party!

36:28.200 --> 36:30.714
Up, back, forward, down.

36:31.640 --> 36:34.313
Up, back, forward, down.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.713
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

37:06.520 --> 37:07.839
Amazing.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.279
I think I'm ready
for the 70 meters.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.112
How long you been
sitting there?

37:23.040 --> 37:26.032
Less than an hour.
I landed the 40 meters.

37:26.160 --> 37:27.832
I don't care.

37:29.440 --> 37:32.159
And I've decided...

37:32.240 --> 37:34.151
I'm going to the
Olympics in Calgary.

37:34.240 --> 37:36.037
Why don't you
watch it on TV?

37:36.160 --> 37:38.674
I'm not going to watch,
I'm going to jump.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.119
You're what?

37:40.240 --> 37:41.434
I've got
a golden opportunity.

37:41.520 --> 37:44.114
The only thing I need to do
to qualify is compete.

37:44.320 --> 37:46.197
Must be some
minimum requirement.

37:46.280 --> 37:48.953
Distance,
number of jumps, talent?

37:50.200 --> 37:51.200
No.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.791
See, that's the beauty of it.

37:53.880 --> 37:56.997
They've not updated
the rules for 52 years.

37:57.600 --> 37:59.318
What's your name, man?

37:59.440 --> 38:00.475
Eddie.

38:00.640 --> 38:01.675
Eddie, okay.

38:01.840 --> 38:04.513
Eddie, the smallest Olympic
jump is 70 meters. Okay?

38:04.600 --> 38:06.477
You'll die if you try it.

38:06.600 --> 38:08.272
Given the average jumper
takes four years

38:08.360 --> 38:09.793
to build up to it.

38:09.920 --> 38:11.399
Well, I'm not
the average jumper.

38:11.480 --> 38:13.550
Correct. You're well
below average.

38:13.680 --> 38:15.511
I just did
the 40 meters in a day.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.716
I'm ready for the 70 meters.
I'll do it now if you want.

38:17.800 --> 38:20.030
I'm ready
for my breakfast, so...

38:21.040 --> 38:22.040
Don't.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.396
I need your permission
if I'm gonna jump.

38:25.480 --> 38:26.515
Just get the
hell out of here.

38:26.640 --> 38:27.880
Not until
I get your permission.

38:27.960 --> 38:29.791
Fine, you got my permission.
Give me my breakfast.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.199
I'd like it in writing.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.111
I'll tattoo it
on your face if you like.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.389
No, that won't
be necessary. Thanks.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.069
Come on, let's go.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.278
Any tips, then?

38:53.720 --> 38:55.199
Don't die.

38:58.200 --> 38:59.633
All right.

39:02.560 --> 39:04.039
You're not coming up?

39:04.120 --> 39:06.475
Crashes look
just as good from here.

39:11.920 --> 39:13.478
I'm doing it.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.113
Sure you are.

39:16.600 --> 39:17.874
Hi.
Yeah?

39:18.040 --> 39:20.156
He's not actually
going to jump, is he?

39:20.280 --> 39:24.034
He's crazy but he's not
suicidal. He's just...

39:24.440 --> 39:26.954
<i>...kylling,</i>
you know. <i>Kylling.</i>

39:27.440 --> 39:29.715
What?
Game of chicken. <i>Kylling.</i>

40:24.840 --> 40:25.840
Everything okay?

40:25.920 --> 40:27.751
Yeah, fine.
Just getting ready.

40:29.400 --> 40:31.038
Never done it before.

40:32.840 --> 40:33.909
Honestly?

40:34.680 --> 40:36.238
Could you give me
a push, please?

40:36.320 --> 40:37.548
A push?

40:37.800 --> 40:38.800
Mmm.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.110
It's a lot higher
than I expected it to...

40:41.200 --> 40:42.200
Whoa!

40:52.800 --> 40:53.915
Don't bend your legs!

41:06.920 --> 41:08.911
Stay there. Stay there.
Can you move?

41:10.040 --> 41:12.554
What's wrong with you, man?
You could've killed yourself.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.272
Just stay there.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.235
Hey, hey, hey.
Just take it easy,

41:17.320 --> 41:18.389
everything's
under control here.

41:18.480 --> 41:19.629
If this happens again,

41:19.720 --> 41:21.517
you will need
a stretcher, too.

41:21.600 --> 41:23.352
I'll look forward
to it, man. Yeah.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.599
Take away.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.353
Oh, man.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.278
Crazy Brit.

42:32.960 --> 42:35.269
<i>Peary was
the most naturally gifted</i>

42:35.360 --> 42:37.396
<i>ski-jumper I ever trained.</i>

42:37.720 --> 42:40.598
<i>And he's also my
biggest disappointment.</i>

42:40.720 --> 42:43.393
<i>He should have been
my greatest champion...</i>

42:43.520 --> 42:46.876
<i>...but his focus was not
always on the mountain.</i>

42:47.040 --> 42:49.793
<i>He never understood
that a true Olympian</i>

42:49.920 --> 42:52.150
<i>was not just about
a God-given skill set.</i>

42:52.320 --> 42:55.471
<i>It's about never giving up,
no matter what.</i>

43:02.360 --> 43:05.670
<i>Knowing that doing your best
is the only option...</i>

43:06.120 --> 43:08.793
<i>...even if it results
in failure.</i>

43:29.080 --> 43:32.390
<i>Bronson Peary was
my biggest disappointment.</i>

43:50.520 --> 43:52.511
Not gonna kill me, are you?

43:52.640 --> 43:54.520
If I wanted to kill you,
Eddie, I'd just let you

43:54.600 --> 43:56.716
continue this suicidal
journey on your own...

43:56.800 --> 43:57.835
...because something tells me

43:57.920 --> 43:59.433
you're not gonna give up,
are you?

44:00.240 --> 44:02.720
I plan to try and jump the 70
meters again as soon as possible.

44:02.800 --> 44:05.519
No. Your plan is as follows.

44:05.640 --> 44:08.359
I am gonna teach you
how to land the 70 meter.

44:08.480 --> 44:11.313
'Cause let's face it, man, you've
done the hardest part which is...

44:11.440 --> 44:13.954
...actually having
the guts to do it. Right?

44:14.080 --> 44:15.911
Most people take one look
at it, walk away forever.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.195
Not Eddie Edwards, so...

44:18.320 --> 44:21.790
Garmisch Seniors Tournament.
Next month.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.717
Final jump of the day
is an open event

44:23.800 --> 44:27.190
so if you could just
land one jump, you are...

44:27.320 --> 44:29.231
Going to the Olympics.

44:29.400 --> 44:31.277
Exactly. Get better soon.

44:31.960 --> 44:33.279
All right, coach.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.998
I'm not your coach. Okay?

44:35.080 --> 44:37.514
Seriously. A coach teaches
you how to jump properly.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.079
I'm just teaching you
how to land

44:39.160 --> 44:40.479
so I can get you
out of my hair

44:40.560 --> 44:42.915
as soon as possible.
Got it?

44:43.280 --> 44:44.918
Peary.
What?

44:46.000 --> 44:47.228
Thanks.

44:50.440 --> 44:52.351
Fine. Get better.

45:12.920 --> 45:13.989
If you're really
gonna do this,

45:14.080 --> 45:15.798
we should run through
a couple of things.

45:15.880 --> 45:17.154
Are your knees better?
Mmm-hmm.

45:17.240 --> 45:18.468
They better be.

45:18.880 --> 45:20.677
Okay, you ready?
Yeah.

45:22.360 --> 45:23.759
Okay, before we start,

45:23.840 --> 45:25.876
who's your favorite
female movie star?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.752
Honestly?
Yeah.

45:27.880 --> 45:30.189
Bo Derek.
Bo Derek? Okay, good call.

45:30.320 --> 45:33.073
Okay, every jump
from here on in...

45:33.160 --> 45:36.118
...I want you to approach it
as though you are making love

45:36.200 --> 45:38.430
to the beautiful Bo Derek.

45:38.560 --> 45:39.834
Okay?
Right.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.279
Starting gate
is your foreplay.

45:41.360 --> 45:44.796
The in-run is where you
build your rhythm. Okay?

45:44.960 --> 45:46.279
And the take-off,

45:46.360 --> 45:48.874
that's your special moment.
All right?

45:49.000 --> 45:50.274
Same facial expressions.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.237
Same straining
of the muscles.

45:52.320 --> 45:55.596
The same peaceful
feeling of release, okay?

45:55.720 --> 45:56.914
If you do it right.

45:57.040 --> 45:58.520
Of course, with any
act of love-making

45:58.560 --> 46:01.154
there's only one way to be
sure you've done it right.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.309
Right?

46:02.440 --> 46:03.440
Yeah.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.832
You fall asleep?

46:07.200 --> 46:08.838
She falls asleep?

46:09.280 --> 46:10.918
Okay. Watch.

46:12.720 --> 46:14.278
Mmm. Oh...

46:14.760 --> 46:16.159
Oh, Bo. Oh, all right.

46:16.240 --> 46:17.639
Oh! Bo!

46:19.000 --> 46:20.752
Oh!

46:23.600 --> 46:25.795
Oh! Uh! Mmm!

46:28.120 --> 46:30.953
Bo Derek!

46:32.280 --> 46:33.952
Oh, yeah!

46:36.480 --> 46:37.674
Right.

46:37.760 --> 46:39.591
Am I going down there?
Yeah.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.796
Brilliant.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Eddie.

46:42.200 --> 46:46.352
Crouch. Clench. Release.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.079
That's it.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.639
Yes!

46:50.360 --> 46:51.793
The most shattering physical

46:51.880 --> 46:53.199
and emotional experience
of your life

46:53.320 --> 46:54.639
and that's
the noise you make?

46:54.720 --> 46:55.914
It is in England, yeah.

46:58.960 --> 47:00.518
Okay. Do it again.

47:04.960 --> 47:06.075
That's what I'm talking about.

47:06.160 --> 47:07.195
That was better, weren't it?
Whoo!

47:07.320 --> 47:09.072
Bo Derek! Yeah, baby!

47:10.160 --> 47:12.151
I think a little bit
of wee came out.

47:14.800 --> 47:18.554
So, all you have to do is make
this landing and you qualify.

47:18.640 --> 47:20.153
One jump away
from the Olympics, man.

47:20.240 --> 47:22.037
Get your skis.

47:22.720 --> 47:24.199
Okay. Stay focused.

47:24.320 --> 47:27.392
Do everything I told
you to do only better.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.831
A lot better. Go.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.519
He says you must
treat every jump

47:43.600 --> 47:45.636
as if it is your last.

47:45.800 --> 47:48.678
We are saying for us,
that is easy.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.279
Oh...

47:50.360 --> 47:52.715
I know the feeling.

47:52.800 --> 47:56.110
Idiot. The Englishman will die.

47:57.280 --> 47:58.554
<i>Edwards...</i>

47:58.840 --> 48:00.239
Good luck.

48:00.600 --> 48:03.239
<i>Edwards. Great Britain.</i>

48:15.160 --> 48:17.469
Come on, Eddie.
Come on, man.

48:23.160 --> 48:24.559
Bo Derek.

48:39.880 --> 48:42.633
Arms back, chest down,
fanny in. Lift, lift!

49:03.840 --> 49:06.798
<i>Edwards, 34 meters.</i>

49:06.960 --> 49:08.678
You're in the Olympics.

49:26.520 --> 49:27.873
Really?

49:28.680 --> 49:31.069
"Plucky plasterer
'Fast' Eddie Edwards..."

49:31.200 --> 49:32.315
Fast, huh?

49:32.440 --> 49:34.635
"...set a new British record
in ski-jumping last week

49:34.720 --> 49:36.358
"at Garmisch, Germany...

49:36.440 --> 49:38.317
"...jumping 34 meters."

49:39.240 --> 49:40.878
"Plucky plasterer."

49:41.440 --> 49:43.431
My dad would like that.

49:44.120 --> 49:45.997
Peary, this has got
the Olympic rings on.

49:46.520 --> 49:48.078
Well, it won't
open itself, man.

50:03.080 --> 50:04.640
"We request the pleasure
of your company

50:04.680 --> 50:07.069
"at the British
Olympic Headquarters."

50:08.840 --> 50:11.513
My work is done, man.
You're on your way.

50:12.320 --> 50:14.151
"Fast" Eddie Edwards.

50:22.400 --> 50:24.038
Mr. Edwards.
Mr. Target.

50:24.120 --> 50:27.078
I just wanted to say to you
and to all of you...

50:27.200 --> 50:29.714
...what an honor
this is and...

50:30.040 --> 50:33.589
...I promise not to let you
or the Olympic Team down.

50:34.120 --> 50:36.793
Yes, that's
very nice, Eddie, but...

50:37.760 --> 50:39.716
...in the interest
of safety

50:39.800 --> 50:42.189
we've ratified
a minimum distance of...

50:42.280 --> 50:43.952
...61 meters.

50:44.360 --> 50:45.429
Great.

50:45.600 --> 50:47.033
"Athletes
must now have jumped

50:47.120 --> 50:49.475
"a minimum distance
of 61 meters...

50:49.600 --> 50:51.716
"...in a British
Olympic Association

50:51.800 --> 50:53.199
"recognized tournament...

50:53.320 --> 50:56.630
"...in order to qualify for
the National Olympic Squad."

50:57.400 --> 50:59.038
I'm afraid your jump
doesn't count, son.

50:59.160 --> 51:00.229
Wait, hang on.

51:00.440 --> 51:01.714
I've already qualified.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.153
Well, technically,
you haven't.

51:03.320 --> 51:05.072
Because you just
changed the rules.

51:05.160 --> 51:07.879
It costs £4.5 million

51:08.000 --> 51:10.150
to send a National Squad
to the Olympics.

51:11.120 --> 51:13.714
The Government gives us
a mere fraction of that.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.993
How do you think
we make up the difference?

51:17.120 --> 51:18.155
TV.

51:18.240 --> 51:19.240
Sponsorship.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.477
These companies pay

51:21.560 --> 51:23.676
to be associated
with certain qualities.

51:24.160 --> 51:27.470
Excellence. Achievements.
Victory.

51:27.600 --> 51:30.512
Strangely, they have no
desire to be associated

51:30.640 --> 51:32.790
with ludicrous
antics and defeat.

51:32.920 --> 51:35.070
So, why do I stop
being ludicrous

51:35.160 --> 51:37.151
if I jump 61 meters?

51:37.360 --> 51:38.429
That is the distance

51:38.520 --> 51:41.353
ratified by our
Safety Committee.

51:41.920 --> 51:44.593
Personally,
I'd prefer it to be higher.

51:46.120 --> 51:48.759
Or is it longer?
I never can tell.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.035
Either way,

51:50.160 --> 51:53.197
we will not have
amateurs in the Olympics.

51:53.800 --> 51:55.870
I thought the Olympics
was for amateurs.

51:59.880 --> 52:01.438
As the premier jumper

52:01.520 --> 52:03.033
and the British
record holder...

52:03.200 --> 52:06.954
...don't you think I have a
right to represent my country?

52:08.320 --> 52:09.320
No.

52:12.280 --> 52:13.952
You can see yourself out.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.514
What?

52:17.640 --> 52:19.232
Ugh. It's British
<i>Unausstehliches.</i>

52:19.320 --> 52:20.469
<i>I know.</i>

52:20.560 --> 52:21.788
The only way to qualify

52:21.880 --> 52:24.155
is to make 61 meters
in competition.

52:24.240 --> 52:25.958
So I'm gonna go
on the European circuit.

52:26.720 --> 52:28.870
Man, that's easier
said than done.

52:29.040 --> 52:31.395
Well, I'd need you to come, too.
Will you help me?

52:32.240 --> 52:34.629
Sure, Fly Boy. Why not?

52:34.720 --> 52:36.320
You get the money,
the transport, I'm in.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.549
Let's do this.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.911
So, if this is you now...

52:45.400 --> 52:47.391
...how much more
are they asking you to jump?

52:57.600 --> 52:59.079
Oh.

52:59.160 --> 53:01.071
That's you up poo creek.

53:01.520 --> 53:02.589
Terry.

53:03.040 --> 53:04.917
If I'm gonna go
on the European circuit

53:05.000 --> 53:06.991
I'm gonna need to raise
some serious cash.

53:07.120 --> 53:08.800
Yeah, well, don't ask us,
we ain't got any.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.120
I know.

53:10.200 --> 53:11.679
What about the money
for the van?

53:11.760 --> 53:13.591
Can't that wait
till next year?

53:13.760 --> 53:15.034
No.
I am not spending

53:15.120 --> 53:17.759
any more money
on this rubbish.

53:18.440 --> 53:19.793
It's a matter
of time before

53:19.880 --> 53:21.560
he walks through that
door in a wheelchair.

53:21.800 --> 53:23.870
So you've gotta stop taking
all these stupid risks, son,

53:23.960 --> 53:25.916
and come back and do
a little bit of plastering.

53:26.280 --> 53:28.350
You tried your best.
Fair play to you. Well done.

53:28.440 --> 53:30.271
But it wasn't
good enough, was it?

53:30.440 --> 53:32.749
So it's got to stop.
All this has gotta stop. End of.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.199
Okay.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.111
Come on, son, hurry up.
I don't wanna be late.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.469
What are you doing?

53:43.600 --> 53:44.874
He's coming
to work with me.

53:44.960 --> 53:46.791
Is he?
Yeah, he is.

53:46.960 --> 53:48.871
Oi, come on, son, up you get.

53:48.960 --> 53:50.154
Look...

53:53.000 --> 53:54.149
Oi.

53:54.240 --> 53:55.559
What the hell
are you playing at?

53:55.640 --> 53:57.392
I just need to borrow
it for a few weeks.

53:57.480 --> 53:59.835
Get out of that van. Now.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.234
I'll take really good
care of it, I promise.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.595
- Thank you. Love you.
- I'm warning you.

54:04.480 --> 54:08.314
Oi. Come back here!
You thieving little git!

54:09.000 --> 54:10.069
Did you
know about this?

54:10.160 --> 54:11.673
Mmm. Yeah.

54:11.800 --> 54:14.200
And you're not gonna like what I
did with our savings, either.

54:14.240 --> 54:15.240
Oi!

54:55.320 --> 54:56.320
Ah...

54:56.520 --> 54:58.715
The wanderer returns, huh?

54:58.840 --> 55:01.195
Mum gave me some money and
I sorted out the transport.

55:01.280 --> 55:03.874
Is that what you call it?
Come on, let's get a drink.

55:04.000 --> 55:05.353
Hang on.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.109
I don't wanna get
snow on the seat.

55:08.240 --> 55:10.071
This window is a bugger.

55:12.480 --> 55:15.711
I think it's a good thing they
turned you down, man. It is.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.389
I mean, 61 meters
is a genuine distance.

55:18.480 --> 55:20.755
Means you gotta
do this for real.

55:20.920 --> 55:23.354
Well, it's easy for you to say,
you were a champion.

55:23.480 --> 55:25.550
You were always
really good.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.351
I was kicked off
every team I was ever on

55:28.440 --> 55:30.120
before I even got
a chance to prove myself.

55:30.200 --> 55:32.998
Believe it or not, I do know what
it's like to be written off, Eddie.

55:33.720 --> 55:34.914
Of course,
my solution was

55:35.000 --> 55:37.639
just to crawl inside
the bottle here, but...

55:39.280 --> 55:41.953
I was in hospital for a
year when I was a kid.

55:42.960 --> 55:44.632
Dodgy knees.

55:47.800 --> 55:50.473
All the doctors said
I should give up sport.

55:51.360 --> 55:53.112
Take up reading.

55:55.400 --> 55:56.594
First book I got:

55:56.720 --> 55:59.188
<i>The Official Olympic
Photo Album 1972,</i>

55:59.280 --> 56:00.395
<i>Moments of Glory.</i>

56:00.480 --> 56:02.072
Yeah, I know it.

56:05.280 --> 56:07.589
Well, anyway,
that is the book

56:07.760 --> 56:10.558
that made me realize
I needed my own moment.

56:13.200 --> 56:16.556
That one thing I could do
to prove them all wrong.

56:20.000 --> 56:21.831
Do you think I'm mad?

56:22.080 --> 56:23.149
Yeah.

56:24.760 --> 56:27.797
You're completely
mad, man. But, hey...

56:27.920 --> 56:30.354
...you kinda gotta be mad
to do this sport, right?

56:30.640 --> 56:31.640
Yep.

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
So...

56:36.440 --> 56:38.431
...if you want your moment,
Eddie Edwards,

56:38.520 --> 56:40.317
I can get you your moment.

56:40.560 --> 56:41.959
But it's gonna
hurt like hell.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.758
For both of us.

56:49.200 --> 56:50.918
We need to get you
some proper equipment.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.389
What are we doing here?

56:55.560 --> 56:56.754
Shopping.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.512
Perfect.
Size 11, right?

57:04.600 --> 57:05.715
Mm-hmm.

57:05.840 --> 57:07.432
Oh, wow.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.078
Peary, is this not theft?

57:12.160 --> 57:13.878
It's the Lost and Found, man.

57:13.960 --> 57:15.757
Come on. Some guy dropped
10 bucks on the street

57:15.840 --> 57:17.353
and you were to pick it up,
would that be theft?

57:17.480 --> 57:18.515
Yes.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.039
What if he didn't know
it was missing?

57:20.120 --> 57:22.190
Then I'd give it
to charity or something.

57:22.320 --> 57:25.915
Eddie, you are a charity.
Your needs are much greater.

57:26.120 --> 57:27.678
What about you?

57:28.240 --> 57:30.549
Me? I'm just
stealing these.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.870
Any better?
It's not better. It's crap.

57:51.520 --> 57:52.589
It's more difficult
than I expected.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.680
Good.

58:18.520 --> 58:19.589
Come on, Eddie.

58:28.200 --> 58:30.794
<i>Edwards. 43 meters.</i>

58:31.160 --> 58:32.752
You're a disgrace
to the sport.

58:32.840 --> 58:34.751
Really? Good.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.712
Personal best!

58:38.960 --> 58:41.235
And we're a disgrace!

58:41.360 --> 58:44.238
Keep working on your
Telemark landing. It's key.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.000
Whoa!

58:58.560 --> 59:00.516
You're on your own, man.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.752
Faster, Peary!

59:03.880 --> 59:06.189
More speed!

59:06.320 --> 59:08.993
It's as fast
as this rust-bucket goes.

59:20.400 --> 59:22.960
Edwards. 49 meters.

59:53.880 --> 59:56.553
It's a practice jump. You don't
need paperwork for a practice jump.

59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.997
At Oberstdorf we do
everything to the letter.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.349
To the letter.

01:00:02.440 --> 01:00:03.839
I could've done
two jumps by now.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.117
Relax. Focused, not tense, remember?
Come on.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.750
Focused, not tense.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.320
I did it. 61 meters.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:42.670
And that was without
a headwind or breakfast.

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.239
Yeah? Well, you do that
tomorrow, you're in,

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:45.719
they can't get rid of you.

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.310
Really?
I'm gonna tell your dad.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.994
He's gonna love it.
Yeah, all right.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.758
All right, lovely.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.192
Oh, my God.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.471
He has just jumped
61 meters in practice.

01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.278
61 meters.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:07.631
And if he makes that tomorrow,
he qualifies for the Olympics!

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.391
<i>Number 11,
Edwards. Great Britain.</i>

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.508
Ready.

01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.155
Whoa!

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.550
<i>Edwards, Great Britain.
No jump.</i>

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.754
You don't understand.
This is my last chance.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.432
You've got to give me
another run.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:29.152
At Oberstdorf we do
everything to the letter.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.673
To the letter, I know.
You keep saying.

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.069
But the thing is,
it doesn't help me.

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.758
The British
Olympic Association

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.593
are trying to stop me,
but I have to do this.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.792
This year it's 61 meters.
Next year it'll be 71 meters.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.558
Then it's too late.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.113
I am going up
that hill to jump

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:46.395
and you are going
to record my distance.

01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.918
No more jumping.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.632
Hey, come on.

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.751
Let's go, man.
Let's go.

01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:25.475
You gotta put
that crash behind you, Eddie.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.790
And remember that practice...

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.280
...I just want you
to know, for me,

01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.920
that was the best jump
you've ever done, by a mile.

01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:35.157
Everything was working,
man, everything. It was...

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:38.712
Your take-off,
your timing, your balance...

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.673
...your trajectory
all working together.

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.194
It was like second nature.
It was...

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.318
It was beautiful.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.271
I was really
proud of you, man.

01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.155
<i>Mum...</i>

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.032
...Dad was right.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.193
Wasted all this time
and money on nothing.

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.629
<i>My dream's turned
into a nightmare.</i>

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:31.478
I'm really sorry to have done
this to both of you and...

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.630
I promise I'm gonna
make it up to you.

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:35.914
<i>No more messing around.</i>

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.274
Don't be silly.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:40.312
You've had knock-backs before
and it's never stopped you.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.112
Come on, Eddie.
Dust yourself off.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.434
Mum, you don't understand.

01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.988
I'm never going
to the Olympics.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:49.149
That was my one chance
and I blew it.

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:52.478
So I'm gonna work
the week out for Petra

01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:53.788
and then I'm coming home.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:54.955
<i>Good.</i>

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:57.190
Now, look. Get the van
back here sharpish,

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.280
and I don't ever wanna hear
about ski-jumps again.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:00.909
<i>Goodnight.</i>

01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:05.711
Don't worry about him, love.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.638
It'll be fine.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.631
I love you.
<i>Love you, too, Mum.</i>

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.800
Bye.

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:14.840
Bye.

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:31.791
Hey, Eddie,
this came for you.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.679
Thank you.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:53.598
Peary!
Eddie, man, come here.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.914
I've been doing
some thinking.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.673
They recorded the
flippin' practice jump.

01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:58.760
Huh?

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.592
It's official. It counts.

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:05.235
61 meters.
"Everything to the letter."

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:06.915
You should go and pack,
my friend,

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.037
because we
are going to Canada.

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.512
If you go now, they're
never gonna let you back.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:14.272
You understand that?
So?

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.516
So, all you can prove is
you don't mind coming last?

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.634
Mmm...
I don't mind really.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:24.470
Okay, look, you and me,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.551
we should take another
four years. Okay?

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:29.234
Let me coach you properly
and we can do this for real.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:31.032
You could even jump
the 90 meter

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:33.156
and be taken
seriously, Eddie.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.515
What are you talking about?
We've just pulled off the impossible.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:36.993
I'm gonna go.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.752
Then you're on your own, man.
Because I can tell you,

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.673
it won't mean anything
if you sell yourself short.

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.120
What's
the matter with you?

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:44.309
We should go back in '92,

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.231
not as a qualifier,
as a contender.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.719
I don't understand.
This is everything

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.915
we've worked for, isn't it?

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.189
Listen to me...

01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:52.360
...a year after I got bumped
from the Olympic Squad

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.670
I went back to Warren Sharp
to apologize. Okay?

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.273
I literally got down
on my knees

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.191
and I begged him
to let me jump again.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.316
You wanna know what
his last words to me were?

01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:02.158
"You will never take
jumping seriously

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:05.437
"because you do not
take yourself seriously."

01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.194
Okay. Are they gonna be
your last words to me, too?

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.392
Don't make the
same mistake, Eddie.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.630
Okay? I'm begging you.

01:07:13.800 --> 01:07:16.268
Do it right
or don't do it at all.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.913
You're crazy.
This time a year ago

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.149
you were plowing snow.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:21.157
And you were landing
on your head a year ago.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.480
Look at the progress
we've made.

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.358
Exactly!
This is my moment!

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.715
Don't make this
your moment, please!

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.075
You'll be a fool.
They'll make you a fool.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.434
Well, I'd rather be
a sober fool

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:32.670
than a drunken coward!

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.230
Any pinching
under the arms, sir?

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:04.839
Maybe you were right,

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.150
we should have gone
for 71 meters.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.352
Yes, maybe
you should have.

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.274
And where do you think
you're going, young man?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.318
The Olympics.
I know.

01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:34.314
I thought you
might need this.

01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.595
Don't think I'm gonna be
winning any medals, Mum.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.352
Well, you never know, pet.

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:42.953
But if not,
you'll like the sandwiches.

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:44.799
Thank you.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.309
Your dad's sorry
he couldn't come.

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:50.673
Have fun.

01:08:51.319 --> 01:08:52.514
I will.

01:08:55.479 --> 01:08:57.630
Skis in the back,
Edwards.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.312
He seems nice.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.318
Yeah. Thanks for coming, Mum.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:38.430
Okay, this guy
right here.

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:40.835
Okay, give me some space,
boys. Give me some space.

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.591
I'll catch you
in five, fellas.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:48.871
Gotta love
them mountains, huh.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.350
Eddie, isn't it? Zach.
I know.

01:09:51.479 --> 01:09:53.710
This is my second
Olympics, Eddie.

01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:54.994
So I know exactly
how you're feeling.

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.638
Little bit overwhelmed,
I imagine, huh?

01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:58.199
Just glad to
be here really.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.474
Yeah, I bet.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.516
Listen, I know
Target's not a big fan,

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:02.919
but forget
about him, okay?

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.035
You're part
of the team

01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.348
and that makes you
okay in my book.

01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:07.749
In fact we've got a little
team tradition going.

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:09.273
I'd love you to come along.
Come on.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.709
I was gonna have a stroll
and get my bearings.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:13.358
Your bearings? What do you need to know?
We're in Canada.

01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.192
You've got mountains
and snow, all right.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:16.713
Now you've got your bearings.
You're gonna love this.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.199
Let's go.
Hmm, all right.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.516
I don't really
drink, Zach.

01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:26.360
Come on, man. Everybody
on the team does it.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:27.913
Do you wanna put
a curse on us all?

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:29.433
A curse, really?

01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:32.159
Look, Eddie.
It's just a thing, okay?

01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.430
Some of the guys believe it.
It's for good luck...

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:36.518
...but it's
a team tradition, Ed.

01:10:37.200 --> 01:10:39.156
And you are part of this team.

01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.398
To the British team.

01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.715
There you go,
that's the spirit.

01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.028
Can I get a lager beer

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.758
and a mineral
water here, please?

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:51.233
Do I have to do
all five of them?

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.958
Yeah, you bet.

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.752
That's a good choice.
That's absinthe.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.031
<i>57 nations.</i>

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.594
<i>1,700 athletes.</i>

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.631
<i>60,000 spectators.</i>

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.035
And more than
2 billion TV viewers

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.354
around the globe.

01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:12.192
<i>All have come together</i>

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.589
<i>for the 15th Olympic
Winter Games...</i>

01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.073
<i>...where today...</i>

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:20.193
<i>...the words will be spoken:
"Let the games begin!"</i>

01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.029
Where is he?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.313
I can't see him.

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.760
What are they doing with
those stupid berets on?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:34.189
It's all
a bit stupid if you ask me.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.676
I mean, what have horses
gotta do with skiing?

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:44.880
Okay.

01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.438
Look at this.
I love this guy.

01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.155
Wake up, Princess Anne.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:58.471
Ah! My head.

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:02.639
How long have I got?

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:05.678
Oh, I'm sorry,
it seems like you overslept.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.955
Yeah. Me and a
couple of the fellas

01:12:07.040 --> 01:12:08.439
just wanted to come down
and thank you

01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:10.431
for helping us
avoid that curse.

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:13.870
Think I'm about to have
my first fight, ever.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:16.633
This is the complaint
I was telling you about.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.154
What's going on here?

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:20.559
We're having a team talk.

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.518
Well, I find that
rather surprising

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.239
considering you were not
with the team earlier.

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.672
Any particular reason
you were not with us

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.113
at the ceremony?

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.594
Upset tummy.

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:34.194
Had to come down
and clean my kit.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:37.035
You'd better get your
nerves under control

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.111
otherwise you'll be
jumping in a nappy.

01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.716
<i>The crowd
have really come alive</i>

01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:49.558
<i>at the sight
of the Flying Finn.</i>

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.716
Not what you'd call
an accessible figure.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.791
Prefers to let his
jumping do the talking.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.871
<i>And here he comes.</i>

01:13:07.720 --> 01:13:10.393
<i>Oh, my word!
This is his first speech.</i>

01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:13.592
<i>That is a big jump.
That is very big.</i>

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:17.398
<i>It's over 100 meters.
It's 114 meters.</i>

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.114
<i>That is a very
impressive first jump.</i>

01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:21.514
<i>The crowd are on their feet.</i>

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:22.999
Mr. Edwards?

01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.435
<i>Mind you, he doesn't
look very impressed...</i>

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:27.755
<i>...because he sets himself
very high standards.</i>

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:30.628
We'll definitely see him
this time, love.

01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:33.268
Yeah, falling on his arse.

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.638
<i>The one participant</i>

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.836
<i>from Great Britain...</i>

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.753
<i>...number 24, Eddie Edwards.</i>

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.353
<i>And here he comes.</i>

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.954
<i>Britain's Michael
"Eddie" Edwards.</i>

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.078
Come on, Eddie.

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.434
Terry, love, he's about to jump.
Come on.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.630
<i>A relative
newcomer to the sport.</i>

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.950
<i>Not a lot of
information about him.</i>

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:01.832
<i>He would never
have experienced</i>

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.718
<i>an atmosphere like this
before, that's for sure.</i>

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:07.271
<i>It'll be the first for me</i>

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.918
<i>to be commentating
on a British...</i>

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.228
...ski-jumper
at the Olympics

01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:12.151
and let's hope
he's the first of many.

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.278
Yes!

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.755
Yes, yes!

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.909
<i>To say that
his style is unorthodox</i>

01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.355
<i>would be something
of an understatement...</i>

01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:02.994
<i>...but it obviously
works for him.</i>

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.276
<i>And the scoreboard
shows... 60. 5 meters.</i>

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.549
<i>It is a new
British Olympic record.</i>

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.153
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.271
I'm a British record...

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.233
Mum. Mum, I love you.
British record!

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.878
I love you, too, son.

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:24.396
I'm a British
record holder! Yes!

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:31.399
Whoo!

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.312
<i>And look at the young man.</i>

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.875
<i>He's overjoyed with himself.</i>

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:42.597
Oh, and the crowd
are loving this.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.591
He's really
getting them going.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.911
Eddie, what are you doing?

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.069
It's not funny. No.

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.639
<i>He may not have
soared like an eagle,</i>

01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.235
<i>but he's certainly
flapping around like one.</i>

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.679
Would you believe it?

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:18.917
Britain's Eddie
"The Eagle" Edwards

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.672
having the time
of his life.

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.796
<i>The crowd have certainly taken</i>

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.952
<i>our Eddie "The Eagle"
to their hearts.</i>

01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:28.279
<i>What a character.</i>

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.440
<i>Looks like that's
the last we'll be seeing</i>

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.795
<i>of Great Britain's
Michael Edwards...</i>

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.593
<i>...as he comes last
in the 70 meter.</i>

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.591
<i>Some people are calling him
Eddie "The Eagle."</i>

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.352
<i>I think, given his distances,</i>

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:42.318
<i>Eddie "The Penguin"
would be a little more apt.</i>

01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.834
<i>But at least we have the
90 meter to look forward to.</i>

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:46.712
<i>Now this is the event
that truly separates</i>

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:48.358
<i>the men from the boys.</i>

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:49.920
<i>Of course, one boy
who won't be there</i>

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.353
<i>is Eddie "The Eagle"...</i>

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.431
<i>...as it's hard
to play up to the crowd</i>

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.272
<i>when you're strapped
to a stretcher.</i>

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:56.998
<i>But now over
to the bobsleigh event</i>

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:00.038
<i>where the Jamaican team
are trying to steal Eddie's...</i>

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.358
Michael Edwards,
but everyone calls me Eddie.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.198
Hmm. Your
name's not here.

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.796
Well, can you check again?
I am on the team.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:23.959
You might be on the team
but you're not on the list.

01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:26.594
Appleby, you old dog.
Zach.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.676
Say hi to your daughter
for me.

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:41.588
Ah. Eddie, there you are.
I'm Carrie.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.876
I handle the press
for the British team.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.518
Been looking all over for you.
Where have you been?

01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:47.671
Here. There's a problem.
I tried to get into the lunch

01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:48.829
but my name's
not on the list.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:49.920
Never mind that.

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:51.149
There's a big
press turn-out

01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:53.276
and they all want
to hear your story.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.430
Wow. Really?
Yes.

01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:56.919
Now, you must
remember to thank

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.228
the British
Olympic Association

01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:00.351
for all their support.
That's very important.

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.440
Okay.

01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:02.555
Don't be nervous.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.790
Just be yourself
and try and enjoy it.

01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:05.955
Okay.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.077
Control yourselves, people.
Everybody sit down.

01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.037
One at a time.
Come on, sit down.

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:16.993
I'd like to introduce you
to Eddie Edwards,

01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.674
sometimes known
as Eddie "The Eagle."

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.512
Hello, everybody.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:31.200
How long have you
been ski-jumping for?

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:32.992
Nearly almost a year.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.793
I'm not sure,
I haven't been counting.

01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:41.120
Do you
have your own skis?

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.633
Do you own your own skis?

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:45.035
I wasn't told about this.
What the hell is going on?

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:47.993
It's press. They can't
get enough of him.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.991
I get so many requests
for interviews.

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:51.473
He's a PR dream.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:54.273
Really? Well it looks
more like a nightmare.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:58.393
Wind it up as soon as you can.
We have better things to do.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.793
Will you do one of your
special eagle flaps for us?

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.437
What, this one?

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:09.198
<i>Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards</i>

01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.748
has divided opinion
here in Calgary.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:13.159
Some athletes
and officials

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.629
are questioning
his right to be here.

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:18.232
Hello, Eddie.

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.709
Clive North. <i>The Sun.</i>

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:23.758
Now, listen, there's
a hairdresser in Bristol

01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:25.910
claiming that she's
been your lover...

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.991
...for the last
two years.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.752
Any comment?

01:19:31.160 --> 01:19:33.674
Now, Ron,
as a British commentator,

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.034
what are your thoughts?

01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:36.997
Well, he's earned
his right to be here.

01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.311
<i>Love him or hate him, you have to
admire his spirit and determination.</i>

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.352
<i>And let's not forget what the
founder of the Olympic movement,</i>

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:45.192
<i>Baron de Coubertin said:</i>

01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:46.912
"The most important thing
in the Olympic Games

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.753
"is not to win
but to take part."

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.796
It's not the triumph
but the struggle.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:54.314
Got any photos
of yourself as a baby?

01:19:54.400 --> 01:19:55.992
...keep ourselves
lean and mean.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.595
Make sure the...
Keep the wolf from the door.

01:20:03.160 --> 01:20:04.513
Did you see me on TV?

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:06.192
Yeah, we all saw you, man.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.953
<i>And?</i>

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.599
And what?

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.751
And what did you think?

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.435
Still think I made
the wrong decision?

01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.748
They love me.

01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:18.438
You confirmed
all my fears, Eddie.

01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:19.999
No-one is taking you
seriously.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.672
You are nothing
but a side-show.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:26.113
And the very minute that
90 meter competition starts

01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:27.519
you'll be forgotten.

01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:29.835
Okay? So enjoy
your 15 minutes of fame.

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.515
Well, don't
hold back, will you.

01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.676
<i>You asked for the truth, bud.</i>

01:21:29.680 --> 01:21:30.680
Hello.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.671
I've got everything ready.
What's going on?

01:21:32.760 --> 01:21:34.239
It's gonna be okay,
I promise.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.914
I could get into big
trouble for this, Eddie.

01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.678
Be fine.
Okay.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.153
Thank you.

01:21:45.560 --> 01:21:47.232
Thank you all for coming.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:52.471
I'm not deluded.

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:54.359
I know there are
plenty of athletes

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:57.034
more deserving
of publicity than me.

01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:59.556
And I would like to apologize

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.638
if my silly antics have cast a
shadow over their achievements.

01:22:04.040 --> 01:22:06.235
<i>I also know that
I was messing around</i>

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:09.835
<i>a little bit after the
70 meter jump the other day.</i>

01:22:12.520 --> 01:22:14.272
I was very excited.

01:22:16.840 --> 01:22:19.752
But I take jumping
very seriously.

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:25.671
In fact, I love it.

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.510
I love it very nearly as much
as proving people wrong.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.354
<i>Which is why I've decided
to compete in the 90 meters.</i>

01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:42.915
What?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.474
Wait, I...

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.109
I know I'd originally only
intended to jump the 70 meters.

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.959
But as people
much wiser than me say...

01:22:57.240 --> 01:23:00.949
...competing in the Olympics doesn't mean
anything if you sell yourself short.

01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.994
<i>I didn't come here
as a novelty act.</i>

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.709
And I will not
be going home as one.

01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.679
Thank you for your time.

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.636
<i>Let's just say
in the Wild West</i>

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.160
<i>we'd be measuring you
for your coffin</i>

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.111
<i>before you even
reach the stairs.</i>

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.558
Eddie "The Eagle."

01:23:35.680 --> 01:23:38.353
Yeah, it has kind of
a ring to it, I guess.

01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760
Wow.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.751
I thought you said
I was a fool.

01:23:44.840 --> 01:23:48.116
Yeah, well, an old friend helped
me see things differently.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.394
What's with
the fluff, man?

01:23:49.480 --> 01:23:50.800
You having a crisis
of confidence?

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.194
Fluff?
This is a moustache.

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.474
Is that
what you call it?

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:54.879
Yeah. Nice jacket.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.110
What happened
to the other one?

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.032
Well, I got rid of it.

01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:00.949
Really?

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.593
For now.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:05.597
And it's cold,
let me tell you.

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:10.038
So is this the bit where
you say "I told you so"?

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.799
No, this is where I say
that without the booze

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.916
I wouldn't even have
the guts to do that jump.

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:17.709
As your coach,
I think you're crazy.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.994
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:21.275
But as your friend,
I say you gotta do it.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.554
This is your moment.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.789
I need a practice jump.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:25.552
What do you need to know
you don't know already?

01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.959
It's higher than
you've jumped before.

01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:28.718
You're gonna go faster
than you've ever gone before.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.994
You're gonna
fly farther than

01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.116
your tiny little brain
can handle, but...

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.153
...it's just
a jump, man. Simple.

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:38.398
Eddie, listen.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.753
You got more dedication,
you got more heart and spirit

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.717
than any of those other
jumpers out there.

01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:45.869
Any of them.

01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:46.960
Jesus, I spent six months

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.156
trying to get rid
of you, dude.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.113
You're like gum on my shoe,
you never gave up.

01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:55.596
I mean, are you gonna
give up now, at the Olympics?

01:24:57.680 --> 01:24:59.432
This is your moment.

01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:02.911
You're Eddie
"The Eagle," man.

01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.879
Proud of you.
I'm proud of myself.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:10.315
That's very modest,
Peary.

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.998
You do realize
that smoking cigarettes

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.152
is a lot more dangerous
than jumping the 90 meters?

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:23.190
90 meters,
what is that in feet?

01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:29.192
I dunno, about 300.
No, actually, it's about 295.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.912
Oh, my God.

01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:44.760
I wanna hear you at the back
of the stands, all right, man?

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.518
Okay, if you're
not yelling it,

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.318
you're not selling it.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:54.836
You're quite
a popular guy, Eagle-Man.

01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:56.440
Every time you turn
on TV you're there.

01:25:56.480 --> 01:25:59.040
Yeah. Maybe perhaps
you can tell us,

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.314
what's the secret?

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:02.239
Clothes.

01:26:03.720 --> 01:26:05.392
<i>...underneath
the landing area making it</i>

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:07.198
<i>harder and more
dangerous than usual.</i>

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.633
Can't we watch
<i>It's A Knockout?</i>

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.917
I'll knock you out if you
turn that channel over.

01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:15.276
Just remember, you're gonna
land really hard on this jump.

01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:18.079
When your skis hit the slopes,
you gotta keep your butt up.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.518
<i>Oh! That is
a very nasty crash.</i>

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:25.876
<i>Oh, no, he won't be
walking away from that.</i>

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.994
<i>I can see the paramedics
rushing to give him help.</i>

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.633
Otherwise you're
gonna be joining him.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.948
<i>Well, that may not be</i>

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:34.310
<i>the only wipe-out
we see today...</i>

01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.709
<i>...not with Britain's
Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards</i>

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.791
<i>coming up soon.</i>

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.872
<i>Eddie's coach is none other
than Bronson Peary...</i>

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.151
<i>...fallen whiz-kid
of '70s ski-jumping.</i>

01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:48.314
And a former Olympic
squad member of yours,

01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.833
if I'm not mistaken,
Warren.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:52.878
Well, we spent
some years together, yes.

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.228
What do you think about

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.595
<i>his unconventional
return to the sport?</i>

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.075
<i>In jumping
there's an expression...</i>

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:01.791
<i>..."You're never
bigger than the hill."</i>

01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.633
<i>And that was
Bronson Peary to a tee.</i>

01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:08.635
<i>I never could deal with that.
It broke us apart...</i>

01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:12.355
<i>...because, as a young man,
he had such talent.</i>

01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.678
<i>Technique, flair.</i>

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:18.155
<i>Everything but discipline.</i>

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.552
<i>As a jumper
he was so disrespectful...</i>

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:24.989
...of the sport
that I'm afraid he's gonna do

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.355
the same thing now as a coach.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:30.838
<i>Thank you, Warren.</i>

01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.434
<i>Certainly sharp words
from Warren Sharp...</i>

01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.632
No pressure there, then.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.751
Where's my jacket
when I need it, huh?

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:38.915
Edwards!

01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.712
I'm Edwards.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:53.072
You all right?
Yeah, fine.

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.319
You all right?

01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:57.589
Yeah.

01:27:57.680 --> 01:27:58.680
Good.

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.352
Let's do this.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:12.558
Eddie "The Eagle."

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.318
Eddie "The Eagle."

01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:26.238
For you. Not for them.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:28.909
Just relax, man.
Forget about the numbers,

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.036
just remember
your fundamentals.

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:32.519
Don't worry
about how far.

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.990
Just up, back, forward, down.
Okay? Up, back, forward, down.

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:37.599
You got this.
Peary.

01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:40.512
It's gonna be all right.

01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.672
Bo Derek, all or nothing.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:45.071
Give it both barrels, man.

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.519
See you at the bottom.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:49.308
Jumping is all
that matters.

01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:50.793
If I didn't jump,

01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:53.440
I would drink and have
sex all the time.

01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:57.711
Hey, congratulations
on your medal.

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.789
I win gold but
I didn't do my best.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.714
You see,
if I've done my best

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.439
I can come last
and be happier.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.315
Like me?

01:30:09.400 --> 01:30:10.958
You do not do good.

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.558
No, I suppose not.

01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.152
You've done better.

01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:19.520
Yeah.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:24.358
Do you think
I'm being patronizing?

01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:25.799
No, no, no.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.435
You and I...
You and I are like

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.397
1 o'clock and 11 o'clock.

01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:33.353
You see we are closer to
each other than to others.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:34.480
Winning, losing,

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.949
all that stuff
is for the little people.

01:30:37.040 --> 01:30:40.476
Men like us, we jump
to free our souls.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.389
We are the
only two jumpers

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.072
with a chance
to make history today.

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.593
If we do less
than our best

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.796
with the whole world
watching...

01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.832
...it will kill us inside.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:58.438
For all time.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.672
Good luck, Matti.

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.557
<i>On to gate number 49,</i>

01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:28.359
<i>Matti Nykanen from Finland.</i>

01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.035
<i>And here
he comes, Matti Nykanen...</i>

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.633
...the Flying Finn.

01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:34.597
The youngest
World Champion ever...

01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:37.752
<i>...and on his day,
the most supreme...</i>

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.950
...jumper the sport
has ever seen.

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:52.190
<i>He makes it look
so effortless.</i>

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.480
<i>And that's it.</i>

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:55.954
<i>Olympic history
has been made today.</i>

01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:59.112
<i>The crowd rise
to acclaim the champion.</i>

01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.518
<i>Now,
up next for the 90 meter</i>

01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.318
<i>from Great Britain...</i>

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:12.759
<i>...number 24, Eddie Edwards.</i>

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.478
Come on.

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.320
<i>By virtue of the fact</i>

01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:33.271
<i>that he jumped the 70 meter...</i>

01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.556
<i>...Edwards qualified
for the 90 meter</i>

01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:38.359
<i>which should prove
quite spectacular.</i>

01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.552
<i>As I'm informed,
he's never jumped</i>

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.551
<i>the 90 meter before.</i>

01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.354
<i>Eddie,
you are not an athlete!</i>

01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.429
Come on, man, just go, go, go.
What are you doing?

01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.069
<i>You tried your best</i>

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:09.310
<i>but it wasn't
good enough, was it?</i>

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:15.633
Don't tell me
he's freezing up.

01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.910
He hasn't got much time left.
Come on, Eddie.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.553
What's he doing?

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.551
<i>What's he doing up there?</i>

01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:24.200
<i>Seems to be having
second thoughts.</i>

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.639
<i>Surely he's gonna jump.</i>

01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.470
<i>You will never
be Olympic material.</i>

01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:35.588
Edwards.

01:33:59.560 --> 01:34:00.595
Push!

01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.438
Up and out. Up and out.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:15.431
No, release, release.
Come on, release!

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:45.915
Oh! He seems to have
lost it in the flight.

01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:47.640
Not sure how he's gonna
make this landing.

01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:57.312
<i>He's down.</i>

01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:00.949
<i>No, he's on his back.
Can he recover?</i>

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.832
<i>Come on, Eddie.</i>

01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:20.355
Yes!

01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:25.029
Yes!

01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:35.198
<i>He's made it! Unbelievable!</i>

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.870
Yes!

01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:42.909
I've been waiting
a long time to say this,

01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:44.592
well, here goes...

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:47.353
...The Eagle has landed.

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:54.875
Eddie "The Eagle."
Eddie "The Eagle."

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.193
<i>But it's a personal best</i>

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:03.952
<i>in competition for Edwards.</i>

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:06.873
<i>71.5 meters...</i>

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:12.275
...and that is a new
British Olympic record!

01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:36.358
Good man.
Come here.

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.838
Yes!
Yes!

01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:47.308
Hey, hey...

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.673
You were down here.
How did you not fall?

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:55.795
It was unbelievable.

01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:57.598
I have never gone
that far before.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:01.469
To see 71 meters
it was like...

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.156
Is that a good book?

01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.552
Instructive?

01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:31.435
Very.

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.959
May I?

01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.160
You...

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:49.800
...brilliant.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.992
Well done.

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.152
I was wrong...

01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:06.159
...about you.

01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.393
Champion.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.834
<i>You have
broken world records.</i>

01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:32.109
<i>You have established</i>

01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:34.634
many of your own
personal bests...

01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.031
...and some of you have
even soared like an eagle.

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:49.391
<i>It was so flattering.</i>

01:38:49.880 --> 01:38:51.438
I wasn't expecting
that at all.

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.876
Yeah. Well,
I think I can match that.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:00.792
"Now the real work begins.
WS." Warren Sharp.

01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.074
Yeah. Yeah.

01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.395
So how about it?
Here's to the next four years.

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.879
Ah.
Ugh.

01:39:12.960 --> 01:39:14.632
God, that's good.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.189
Hello, Mum.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.839
Hello.

01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:34.560
Where do you think
you've been, young man?

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:37.030
Competing
in the Olympics, Mum.

01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.473
I'm so proud of you, son.

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:03.437
I mean that.
I'm so proud of you, mate.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.392
Thanks, Dad.

01:40:35.640 --> 01:40:37.232
So proud of you, man.

01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:58.475
<i>I'm shouting</i>

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:01.996
<i>Don't care who is listening</i>

01:41:02.080 --> 01:41:05.516
<i>Don't live here,
I'm visiting</i>

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:09.673
<i>To go where I've never been</i>

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.399
<i>I'm reaching</i>

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:16.155
<i>'Cause this isn't far enough</i>

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:19.676
<i>There's more
in this heart than love</i>

01:41:19.800 --> 01:41:24.271
<i>Won 't stop
till I'm high above</i>

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:27.750
<i>I'm cursed with anticipation</i>

01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.389
<i>I have no time
for conversation</i>

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:36.036
<i>Look at me,
I'm free to do what I want</i>

01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:38.429
<i>What I want</i>

01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:41.956
<i>Come on, thrill me
Come on, kill me</i>

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.350
<i>Feel the blood rush
Round the body</i>

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:48.830
<i>Can 't hold it in
and I can't fight it</i>

01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:52.549
<i>Can 't turn away
and I can't hide it</i>

01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:56.076
<i>Come on, find me
Come on, blind me</i>

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:59.630
<i>Look, the fear
is far behind me</i>

01:41:59.720 --> 01:42:03.076
<i>What was just a dream
now will be</i>

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:06.709
<i>I'm calling to the world,
Come on, come on, thrill me</i>

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.715
<i>Come on, thrill me</i>

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.634
<i>I feel alive
when you're with me</i>

01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.429
<i>I feel the endless
possibilities</i>

01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.717
<i>You give me something
You give me something</i>

01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:36.634
<i>You give me everything</i>

01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:40.110
<i>And I will make it
all worth it</i>

01:42:40.200 --> 01:42:43.988
<i>Yeah, I will reach
the summit white as snow</i>

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:47.152
<i>You make me wanna
You make me wanna</i>

01:42:47.240 --> 01:42:50.198
<i>You make me wanna be yours</i>

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:53.909
<i>'Cause we were honestly</i>

01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.515
<i>We were nothing
more than each other</i>

01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:01.036
<i>But I needed you
Yeah, I needed you</i>

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:05.511
<i>Like you needed me</i>

01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:09.716
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

01:43:09.800 --> 01:43:13.634
<i>Traveling high
Learning to fly</i>

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:16.951
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.874
<i>Out of the sky
For you</i>

01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:24.316
<i>Learning to fly
Out of the sky</i>

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:28.234
<i>Out of the sky
I'm on a ride</i>

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.790
<i>All over town
I'm coming down</i>

01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:35.668
<i>Learning to fly
For you</i>

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:40.038
<i>I can see the eagle landing</i>

01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:45.950
<i>It's all I wanna do now</i>

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:50.870
<i>Didn 't think
I'd ever get so high</i>

01:44:02.560 --> 01:44:06.872
<i>Take me to that
hallowed ground</i>

01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:13.996
<i>High above
So safe and sound</i>

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.077
<i>Do your best
to clip my wings</i>

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:28.599
<i>You see, my skin
is thicker than you think</i>

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:32.195
<i>So I lock away that madness</i>

01:44:32.280 --> 01:44:35.670
<i>Keep emotion in a tight fist</i>

01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:42.598
<i>Gonna hold my head up high
until I reach the summit</i>

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:50.671
<i>Ascension</i>

01:44:52.840 --> 01:44:57.675
<i>Just sky holding me</i>

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.550
<i>Oh to rise like an angel</i>

01:45:02.640 --> 01:45:06.235
<i>Just to kiss every star</i>

01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:09.432
<i>See the cloud's
silver lining</i>

01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:12.956
<i>Flying high and far</i>

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:18.910
<i>Oh, ascension</i>

01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:25.559
<i>Ascension</i>
