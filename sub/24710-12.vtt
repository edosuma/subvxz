Normally when they get home,
Tonya's already gone to school.

So yesterday, they don't realize
that Tonya ain't been there.

When this fool A.J. takes
a break from his TV watchin'

01:22.582 --> 01:24.834
to say he never saw Tonya
leave that morning.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.961
That's right. It's true.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.090

He sits on the couch
and waits for his check.

01:38.223 --> 01:40.183
-That's his job.
-What kind of check?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.769
Uh, lawsuit settlement.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.481
-You called Tonya's friends?
-We went looking last night,

01:46.606 --> 01:48.149
and then this morning we started calling.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.776
You go looking, too, A.J.?

Huh? No.

Hmm, no. Just as I'm opening the door,
I think I hear shots.

did not contact me by noon today,

Tonya and me had sex
on the beach.

12:34.378 --> 12:36.672
And did Tonya willingly have sex with you?

12:36.839 --> 12:39.008
Yeah. I was her first.

12:39.091 --> 12:41.051
And I know it must've
hurt some, but, um...

12:41.177 --> 12:42.970
I knew she was glad.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.972
Then afterwards, what?

12:45.431 --> 12:48.851
We was layin' on the rug,
you know, talkin'...

12:50.561 --> 12:54.440
and Tonya said she wanted
to go away with me.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.442
Where'd she wanna go?

12:56.650 --> 12:58.778

Take her someplace warm.

take her away forever.

-Well, you say the beach...

13:11.624 --> 13:13.417
but you also say the rug.

-I don't know. It's fuzzy.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.634
I take these anti-seizure meds,

13:21.717 --> 13:24.094
and you know, they make
everything a little fuzzy.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.930
And that's for your head injury.

13:26.222 --> 13:30.142
No, I also got a slow-growin'
benign tumor in my head.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.352
Oh.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.771
That's been the holdup
on... on my settlement.

13:33.854 --> 13:37.858
Because the city is saying
that I've got this pre-existing situation.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.570
-Okay, A.J. About Tonya.
-What?

13:42.196 --> 13:46.200
Is it possible, your encounter with her
wasn't a dream?

13:46.325 --> 13:47.660
Maybe it was real?

13:48.994 --> 13:50.913
I don't know. Maybe.

13:51.413 --> 13:52.873
When you told her
you'd take her away forever,

13:52.998 --> 13:54.708
did you do something to her?
Hurt her?

13:54.875 --> 13:57.878
-No, I... I would not hurt her.
-JILL: Maybe accidentally,

13:58.003 --> 14:00.047
-not knowing your own strength.
-A.J.: No.

14:01.632 --> 14:05.803
-(CHUCKLES) I mean, it's so fuzzy.
-Do you know where she is now?

14:10.224 --> 14:13.435
-(SIGHS) Maybe I do.
-DIANE: Where?

14:16.647 --> 14:19.149
She's at the Stanley Apartments,
over on 14th.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.778
-JILL: You have a room there?
-No, I used to have a job there.

14:23.696 --> 14:26.615
And they've got this basement,
where there's a boiler.

14:27.324 --> 14:28.909
And it's really hot there,

14:28.993 --> 14:31.579
and I knew she would
be warm like in Jamaica.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.623
So I put her in the trash chute
at the bottom.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.212

14:45.301 --> 14:48.053
-How do you know them?
-(SPITS) I don't.

14:48.220 --> 14:51.098
I went out to go get some coke
and crackers for my upset stomach,

14:51.181 --> 14:53.142
and they accosted me outside my building.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.227
They say anything?

14:55.311 --> 14:58.105
Yeah, the older one,
puts me up against the wall,

14:58.188 --> 14:59.899
starts givin' me the third degree,

15:00.024 --> 15:02.318
sayin' I must've fouled up
his brother's van.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.903
Which is possibly true,

15:03.986 --> 15:07.031
if his brother's the one that drove me
to the airport this morning.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.325
-Which airport?
-LaGuardia.

15:09.491 --> 15:12.620
I was supposed to go to Florida today,
but I felt so lousy, I took a taxi home.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.414
Then when I momentarily
feel well enough to go out,

15:15.497 --> 15:18.334
here come these two assholes,
who knock me around.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.837
The older one says
that I killed his brother,

15:22.046 --> 15:23.088
which is crazy.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.382
Then thank God,
the cops come and save my life.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.593
-Uh-huh.
-Couple of maniacs.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.595
JAMES: Not sayin' what they did
was right, Jay,

15:29.762 --> 15:31.555
but their little brother
got killed this morning.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.891
The one that drove me?

15:34.141 --> 15:36.518
So you can imagine how they might
not be thinking straight.

15:36.936 --> 15:40.314
They kicked me, they beat up on me,
they made fun of my jacket.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.525
They were probably very overwrought.

15:43.692 --> 15:46.445
(SCOFFS) I should be able
to walk to the market

15:46.528 --> 15:48.030
without getting attacked.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.908
No, you're absolutely right,
and we're gonna talk to them.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.493
Are they going to jail?

15:52.618 --> 15:54.620
Look, we'll lock them up,
if that's what you want us to do.

15:54.912 --> 15:55.913
Good.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.207
But keep in mind,
they just lost their brother.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.960
And what they did, even though
it was absolutely wrong,

16:01.043 --> 16:03.337
was them bein' under emotional distress.

16:03.671 --> 16:08.258
-So, now I'm the jerk if I press charges?
-I'm just tellin' you the situation.

16:11.929 --> 16:14.974
Just tell me this,
was this about my lip rings?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.269
Absolutely not.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.983
Forget it. I... I don't feel well enough
for this.

16:24.316 --> 16:25.651

Mr. Irvin, the matter

you and I will have a conversation.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.554
Two weeks ago, my client
Malcolm Cullinan

17:35.679 --> 17:37.139
went to Atlantic City.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.894
With a prostitute
by the name of Dolores Mayo.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.645
Don't call her a prostitute.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.107
I'll call her the dowager princess.
What do you want me to call her?

17:47.274 --> 17:49.234
Do not disrespect her.
She worked in this house.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.033
My client, not being a drug user,

17:56.116 --> 17:58.994
completely naive
about the drug subculture,

17:59.119 --> 18:02.414
had no idea Ms. Mayo was a heroin addict,
till he got to Atlantic City.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.041
Asshole.

18:07.002 --> 18:11.173
Young man, this is the first time
you and I have had dealings together.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.094
You might take on faith
what your volatile partner here

18:15.219 --> 18:16.845
has learned through experience.

18:19.431 --> 18:23.519
Or ADA Cohen and I will adjourn
to a more congenial setting.

18:27.231 --> 18:30.359
My client often times video tapes
his sexual activities,

18:30.442 --> 18:32.236
with the full knowledge of his partners.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.947
As it turns out,
the video camera was running

18:35.405 --> 18:38.158
while Ms. Mayo independently
and voluntarily shot up.

18:38.450 --> 18:41.286
And subsequently died.
It's all on the tape.

18:41.411 --> 18:44.581
The tape show him tryin'
to revive her? Call 9-1-1?

18:44.790 --> 18:46.917
Do you attempt to revive
every junkie you see

18:47.000 --> 18:48.669

18:48.752 --> 18:51.672
Don't call her a junkie
and don't call her a prostitute!

18:54.466 --> 18:57.302
Being a man of a certain social standing,

18:57.845 --> 19:02.015
and out of concern for his wife
and children, my client panicked.

19:02.683 --> 19:06.562
Removed the corpse from the hotel,
and buried it in the Meadowlands.

19:07.187 --> 19:09.690
Um, this was out of panic
and concern for his family.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.359
It didn't have nothin' to do
with the hotel room bein' in his name.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.154
This is my proffer, ADA Cohen.

19:15.696 --> 19:19.741

my client will make a statement.

Not in the dream, but in real life
where Tonya is.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.997
(SNIFFLES) I...

25:41.331 --> 25:46.419
I wrapped her in a... in a sheet
and threw her in a dumpster.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.297
-Behind the building.
-All right. (SIGHS)

25:52.050 --> 25:55.053
(SOBS) Aren't I despicable?

25:55.470 --> 25:57.806
(SNIFFLES)
I don't even deserve that juice.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.893
(SNIFFLES) I'm sorry I'm so despicable.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.565
(SNIFFLING)

26:07.023 --> 26:09.317
John, did you have
any further questions for us

26:09.401 --> 26:10.819
when you came in earlier?

26:10.902 --> 26:13.363
-When Gerald sort of cut you off?
-No, not really.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.408
-(SIGHS)
-Anyways, that kid you beat up,

26:16.616 --> 26:19.244
he's of two minds whether he wants
to press charges.

26:19.536 --> 26:23.039
(SIGHS) I been in a police station
once before

26:23.123 --> 26:26.209
for dropping water balloons on a neighbor.
I was 12.

26:26.334 --> 26:27.335
This is a bigger thing.

26:27.460 --> 26:30.297
I just mean I'm not a criminal type,
and neither is Gerald.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.509
Did Gerald and Frank have any interaction
this morning?

26:34.676 --> 26:36.678
-They talk every morning.
-Regarding what?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.265
Mostly the van.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.225
Was there a dispute at all?

26:43.059 --> 26:44.477
(CHUCKLES, SIGHS)

26:44.769 --> 26:47.647
It's like their morning ritual,
the fight about the van.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.065
I don't even listen anymore.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.860
So, was there a fight
between them this morning?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.284
You feel torn, right?

27:00.201 --> 27:02.746
If you know something
about what might have happened to Frank,

27:02.871 --> 27:05.165
how are you gonna feel
if you leave here not telling us?

27:05.290 --> 27:10.211
The only thing I know for sure,
is that Frank made his run to LaGuardia.

27:10.545 --> 27:12.047
I know, 'cause he called me from there.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.882
He said his ride, the guy was sick
or somethin'.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.426
-He threw up in the van.
-Why'd he call to tell you that?

27:17.135 --> 27:19.554
Because he knew Gerald
would get nuts about it.

27:21.097 --> 27:23.266
Gerald's really into cleanliness.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.727
That's the last time I talked to Frank.

27:26.728 --> 27:30.273
(SOBS) About an hour later,
Gerald leaves work.

27:31.232 --> 27:34.361
Said he wants the van for something,
he's gonna go meet Frank.

27:34.527 --> 27:37.989
Which I knew was this big collision,
waiting to occur.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.699
How long was Gerald gone?

27:43.244 --> 27:44.704
A long time.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.832
(SNIFFLES) He missed an appointment.

27:49.125 --> 27:52.962
(SNIFFLES) I'm not a detective,
you know, but...

27:55.382 --> 27:57.717
there's just something about this
that's all wrong.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.845

28:04.015 --> 28:05.016

28:11.481 --> 28:12.524
(SIGHS)

28:12.691 --> 28:15.068
Our experience in the poky room,

28:15.527 --> 28:17.737
working mainly with street-level scumbags,

28:17.821 --> 28:20.573
you probably haven't had
that privilege too often.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.076
Some high-powered shyster
telling me to behave?

28:24.411 --> 28:28.289
In a career full of embarrassments,
that asshole Sinclair, put me through

28:28.415 --> 28:30.667
the single most humiliating moment.

28:31.584 --> 28:33.128
Which was what?

28:33.378 --> 28:36.756
Made me look like a monkey
on the witness stand.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.760
Of course, I did help him a little,
tryin' to testify drunk.

28:42.637 --> 28:43.972
JOHN: They'll be here in 20 minutes.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.852
This guy's gonna cop
to unlawful disposal, Andy.

28:49.644 --> 28:50.979
All I can tell you,

28:51.312 --> 28:54.232
this is why police work
entails so much energy,

28:54.315 --> 28:56.067
keeping perps and their lawyers separate.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.570
That's the only lesson
you can draw from this.

28:58.737 --> 29:01.906
Dolores is dead and he's gonna pay
a three-figure fine?

29:04.784 --> 29:06.327
Why don't you write your name on that?

29:08.204 --> 29:10.707
You're using it, why don't you write
your name on it?

29:11.291 --> 29:14.252
Let me think of something
we can try in that room.

29:37.442 --> 29:38.610
No good?

29:38.735 --> 29:42.489
-Two hours, 20 dumpsters, no Tonya.
-We canvassed the carting companies.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.449
None of those dumpsters
were serviced this morning.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.117
You wanna turn Andy loose on this guy?

29:46.534 --> 29:49.370
We, uh, promised A.J. he could
make a video confession.

29:49.704 --> 29:50.872
I'm not putting this guy on tape,

29:50.997 --> 29:52.916
if he's just some psycho,
making stories up.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.503
What we were saying riding back,
maybe he's working up to the truth.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.672
-And being on camera gets him there.
-Or maybe all it does

29:59.798 --> 30:02.008
is get him singing
his favorite karaoke hits.

30:02.091 --> 30:04.511
If he starts singing
his favorite karaoke hits,

30:04.594 --> 30:05.845
this guy's getting a tune-up.

with a stupid street fight?

That's how you wanna
honor your dead brother?

30:17.398 --> 30:19.317
Tuning up a guy who's weak
with a stomach upset?

30:19.442 --> 30:22.028
He's a suspect. He was in Frank's van.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.365
-He didn't hurt Frank.
-(SCOFFS)

30:27.784 --> 30:30.495
You're pretty particular
in keeping things tidy, Gerald.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.248
Who said that?

30:33.832 --> 30:35.250
Just a general impression.

30:35.375 --> 30:37.919
GREG: My partner and I understand
where you're coming from.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.463
You got a nice home, a vehicle.

30:40.755 --> 30:43.466
You like to keep those possessions
in shipshape.

30:43.550 --> 30:45.802
(SCOFFS) Yeah. Tell my brothers that.

30:46.553 --> 30:49.597
They get a great laugh
about my pressed pants and the rest.

30:52.851 --> 30:53.977
We also understand

30:54.102 --> 30:56.855
how a guy could reach out
to help a loved one.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.149
And when that person
doesn't show the proper respect

31:00.233 --> 31:03.987
for what you respect,
that can make a person flare up.

31:05.238 --> 31:07.198
Maybe even do something that

31:07.532 --> 31:10.910
the instant he's done it,
he regrets enormously.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.162
Yeah, well...

31:14.581 --> 31:15.748
Now...

31:17.709 --> 31:23.131
when a decent guy makes this misstep,
and then tries coverin' it up,

31:23.256 --> 31:26.509
instead of 18 months for involuntary
manslaughter,

31:26.634 --> 31:30.722
he gets a lifetime of shame and guilt
eatin' at him.

31:31.890 --> 31:36.311
That one wrong deed erodes the quality
of the rest of his life.

31:37.395 --> 31:39.981
Now, if I'm that decent guy...

31:41.107 --> 31:43.610
I think I'd try to make the wrong deed,

31:43.943 --> 31:46.738
a turning point for making a better life.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.990
Instead of trying to bury something,

31:49.073 --> 31:51.784
that a decent person
really can't ever bury.

there's a big mess inside.

32:30.198 --> 32:32.408

how I'm uptight and I'm controlling.

32:43.878 --> 32:48.508
From there, it went bad fast.
Frank kept a gun under his seat.

32:49.217 --> 32:52.220
(BREATHES DEEPLY) We kept arguing, and...

32:52.720 --> 32:55.264
and Frank gets so crazy,
he pulled the gun.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.486
I grabbed for it.

33:09.904 --> 33:12.115
We struggled,
and... and the thing shot.

I'm A.J. Foreman,

33:34.303 --> 33:36.389
and I'm here to admit
what I done to Tonya

33:36.556 --> 33:38.057
and then where I put her.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.061
I'm a rapist...

33:43.312 --> 33:44.605
and a killer.

33:45.732 --> 33:49.861
And after I made love with Tonya
on our hallway rug,

33:50.194 --> 33:53.740
I then used these hands
to choke her, dead.

33:54.449 --> 33:58.369
And before anybody could come home
and see my shame,

33:58.536 --> 34:00.663
I put her body in my car.

34:01.039 --> 34:04.459
And I went to... to the river.

34:05.501 --> 34:10.798
Near the Fulton Fish Market.
Where I put her in the water.

34:11.883 --> 34:13.384
I'm a killer...

when my client is heard to say,
"Pay for your high,"

39:14.477 --> 39:16.395
he is expressing
a speculative inference

39:16.520 --> 39:18.272
concerning the use Ms. Mayo
put to monies

39:18.356 --> 39:20.941
he had paid her for sex. And sex only.

39:21.108 --> 39:24.362
My client never bought
or provided drugs for Ms. Mayo.

39:24.487 --> 39:27.990
Mr. Cullinan will now tell you
how, where, and for what reason,

39:28.657 --> 39:30.868
he came to dispose
of Ms. Mayo's remains.

39:30.951 --> 39:33.204
And that's all he's gonna tell you.

39:33.788 --> 39:35.331
Just give me a second.

39:36.916 --> 39:39.543
Dolores was right. You are goin' to hell.

39:39.668 --> 39:41.128
Aw.

39:42.296 --> 39:44.131
MALCOLM: Can you handle Tinkerbell?

39:44.298 --> 39:45.299
(GRUNTS)

39:46.342 --> 39:48.677
(GROANS)

39:49.178 --> 39:51.555
Jeez, I would definitely bring charges.

39:51.889 --> 39:54.433
Give the whole background on this
a thorough airing.

39:54.517 --> 39:57.061
Yeah. That sounds like a plan.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.731
SINCLAIR: Mr. Cullinan will be
bringing no charges.

40:02.566 --> 40:03.567
Ice.

40:27.425 --> 40:29.176
Me and him are gonna
meet Jersey State Police,

40:29.260 --> 40:30.511
recover her body.

40:31.262 --> 40:32.346
Good.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.529
I'm sorry how this turned out.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.865
I just hope she's at peace now.

40:52.283 --> 40:53.367
Yeah, let's hope so.

40:54.034 --> 40:55.244
I should've done something.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.873
(SOBS) Oh, God!

(JOHN CRYING)

41:36.911 --> 41:38.245
Hey, John, uh...

41:39.622 --> 41:42.291
I lost my brother in similar
difficult circumstances,

41:42.500 --> 41:44.919
where he got involved
in unfortunate stuff.

41:47.296 --> 41:49.423
Actually, he died of a drug overdose.

41:49.715 --> 41:52.218
-Like Dolores.
-(SNIFFLES) I'm sorry.

41:54.220 --> 41:58.307
At first, I couldn't think of anything
but the things he got involved in.

41:58.974 --> 42:02.436
The drugs, his fights with my parents,
how I didn't help him enough.

42:03.729 --> 42:06.273
About a year later,
I passed this schoolyard,

42:06.398 --> 42:08.734
where me and him
used to play handball all the time.

42:09.985 --> 42:12.947
And I realized
that was the first time I thought of him

42:13.030 --> 42:15.616
without thinking about
what I didn't do to save him.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.661
Thinking of him and me in better times...

42:20.246 --> 42:22.122
before all that bad stuff happened.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.166
That I couldn't understand.

42:25.793 --> 42:28.462
-That came as a blessing to me.
-(JOHN SOBBING)

42:29.838 --> 42:33.050
Dolores and I did carry on
a few nights in the dance clubs.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.761
I saw her dance at a ballet recital.

42:38.097 --> 42:39.640
She was a wonderful dancer.

42:41.642 --> 42:45.980
-I just wanted to tell you that.
-Yeah. She loved ballet, too.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.232
Hey, um, John...

42:49.775 --> 42:52.653
when Dolores left,
I didn't put in for a new PAA.

42:53.070 --> 42:54.989
I know you were giving her every chance.

42:56.156 --> 42:59.451
You want to come downstairs here
and let anti-crime put in for one?

43:03.539 --> 43:05.124
I'd like very much to come down.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.084
Good.

43:08.168 --> 43:10.588
-Good.
-DIANE: Good night, boss.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.342
See you tomorrow, John.
