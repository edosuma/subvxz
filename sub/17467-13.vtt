WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.481
Damn, damn, damn!

00:03.525 --> 00:05.570
It's not the purse's fault
you're poor.

00:05.614 --> 00:10.227
No, I borrowed this fancy
necklace from Jill for a date,

00:10.271 --> 00:11.663
and now I can't find it.

00:11.707 --> 00:13.404
Maybe you left it
at your date's house.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.493
The date ended when
we left the Sizzler,

00:15.537 --> 00:18.235
where romance goes to die.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.541
You borrowed a fancy necklace

00:19.584 --> 00:21.021
to go to Sizzler?

00:21.064 --> 00:22.196
He said "steakhouse."

00:22.239 --> 00:24.415
Forgive me for dreaming.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.722
Well, I would love
to help you look,

00:26.765 --> 00:28.071
but Adam and I are heading out

00:28.115 --> 00:29.942
to the Napa Valley
Food and Wine Festival,

00:29.986 --> 00:32.683
[snooty tone]: where the senses
go to celebrate.

00:32.728 --> 00:34.643
Bring me back
an eight-dollar meatball.

00:34.686 --> 00:38.081
Oh, darling, you are
an eight-dollar meatball.

00:38.125 --> 00:40.910
Rich people don't sound
like that.

00:43.173 --> 00:45.654
Brought you some coffee.

00:45.697 --> 00:48.048
What are you still
doing in bed?

00:48.091 --> 00:49.701
Five more minutes.

00:49.745 --> 00:50.876
You said you were getting up.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.095
Ten more minutes.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.793
Exactly how hungover are you?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.665
I'm not.

00:58.188 --> 01:00.843
I am.

01:00.886 --> 01:02.714
Can't we just go next weekend?

01:02.758 --> 01:05.935
We could, but it would
just be an empty field then.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.459
All right, all right,
I'm getting up.

01:08.503 --> 01:10.548
Thank you.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.072
Five minutes.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.162
[door closes]

01:15.205 --> 01:16.337
You're not gonna believe this.

01:16.380 --> 01:18.121
He's too hungover to go.

01:18.165 --> 01:19.514
You're not gonna
believe this.

01:19.557 --> 01:21.646
I found three
of your traffic tickets

01:21.690 --> 01:24.084
and a tooth I'm
hoping is Roscoe's.

01:28.784 --> 01:30.742
It's just so obnoxious
to blow off plans with someone

01:30.786 --> 01:32.527
just 'cause you got loaded
the night before.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.398
And before you say anything,
I promise to take you

01:34.442 --> 01:35.921
to see Santa this year.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.619
Why don't you just go
without him?

01:37.662 --> 01:40.100
You're right, I can totally
go places by myself.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.318
You want to go with me?

01:41.362 --> 01:42.667
I'm not going anywhere till

01:42.711 --> 01:43.755
I find Jill's diamond necklace.

01:43.799 --> 01:44.843
She's gonna kill me.

01:44.887 --> 01:46.323
And you're sure it didn't end up

01:46.367 --> 01:48.020
in the backseat
of your date's car?

01:48.064 --> 01:49.979
My date's car was a city bus.

01:50.022 --> 01:52.155
ADAM:
Okay, I'm up,

01:52.199 --> 01:54.549
and I really want
to go with you.

01:54.592 --> 01:57.160
Forget it, I'm
going by myself.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.509
[door closes]

01:58.553 --> 02:00.032
Thank God.

02:02.383 --> 02:04.689
Do you have, like,
40 aspirin or some bacon?

02:06.300 --> 02:08.215
â™ª

02:26.363 --> 02:29.149
What's this booth?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.759
Oh, some kind of lamb.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.195
I don't know what they do
to the poor little bastards,

02:32.239 --> 02:33.675
but I'm back for fourths.

02:33.718 --> 02:37.331
It's actually a post-modern
take on haggis.

02:37.374 --> 02:38.810
What they do is they
take the sheep's stomach,

02:38.854 --> 02:39.942
they char the lining...

02:39.985 --> 02:41.291
No, no, no.
The guy over there

02:41.335 --> 02:42.336
told me what
sweetbreads were.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.860
I had to spit 'em
in a plant.

02:44.903 --> 02:46.949
Spoiler alert--
pancreas.

02:46.992 --> 02:48.385
[chuckles]

02:48.429 --> 02:50.431
Hey, green wristband, huh?

02:50.474 --> 02:53.347
Yeah, it's 50 bucks cheaper
for the food only,

02:53.390 --> 02:54.913
and I'm not drinking.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.873
So it's just me
and the toddlers.
And me.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.135
Nice.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.224
So are you
a green wristband

03:01.268 --> 03:03.357
just for today,
or all the time?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.707
Actually, I've been one
for about 18 months.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.056
Two years.

03:07.099 --> 03:08.840
And the green
wristband club

03:08.884 --> 03:10.102
just got a little cooler.

03:10.146 --> 03:12.453
Plus, we get
free admission

03:12.496 --> 03:14.498
to the bouncy castle.

03:18.676 --> 03:19.851
Well, it's official.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.940
None of this pairs well
with iced tea.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.421
Well, in defense
of the iced tea,

03:24.465 --> 03:27.163
that deconstructed
Tater Tot was just weird.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.645
Try this ahi.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.302
Mmm. That's good.

03:35.345 --> 03:36.216
Right?

03:38.522 --> 03:40.132
I should bring some
of that home

03:40.176 --> 03:41.699
for my boyfriend.

03:41.743 --> 03:44.920
Yeah, you should.

03:44.963 --> 03:46.269
Where is he today?

03:46.313 --> 03:48.271
To be honest,
he had his own

03:48.315 --> 03:49.925
little food and wine
festival last night.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.014
And by that I mean
Hot Pockets and bourbon.

03:52.057 --> 03:54.712
I remember that festival.

03:54.756 --> 03:56.453
So you remember what
he felt like this morning.

03:56.497 --> 03:58.238
He have a little
trouble standing up?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.761
It would have taken
a miracle.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.808
My ex took perverse
glee in my hangovers.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.157
She'd open
all the curtains,

04:05.201 --> 04:07.377
make my son practice
his clarinet.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.641
Wow, points for creativity.

04:10.685 --> 04:12.817
So, was drinking the reason
you split up?

04:12.861 --> 04:16.081
Well, that and burning
down our restaurant.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.387
Oh, my God.

04:18.432 --> 04:20.825
People tell you
don't drink and drive.

04:20.869 --> 04:22.043
What they really
should say is

04:22.087 --> 04:23.350
don't drink and fry chicken.

04:23.393 --> 04:25.003
[laughs]

04:25.047 --> 04:27.354
Well, at least you
can joke about it now.

04:27.397 --> 04:29.443
Yeah. And I'm proud to say

04:29.486 --> 04:31.227
I just opened up
a new place.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.924
That's great.
It sounds like

04:32.968 --> 04:34.448
you're getting
everything back on track.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.450
Well, not everything.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.321
My kids still don't
speak to me.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.761
For what it's worth,
my daughter didn't talk

04:43.805 --> 04:45.154
to me for a long time.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.765
But things are
in a better place now?

04:47.809 --> 04:49.550
Yeah, we talk all the time.

04:49.593 --> 04:50.899
Careful what you wish for.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.514
Hey, there's Jill.

04:57.558 --> 04:58.950
Did you find
her necklace?

04:58.994 --> 05:01.344
Shut up.

05:01.388 --> 05:04.042
Hey, Christy.
How was your big date?

05:04.086 --> 05:05.783
Good, good.

05:05.827 --> 05:07.785
I got all the salad I could eat.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.526
Okay.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.615
So, um, did you bring
my necklace?

05:11.659 --> 05:13.443
Oh, darn!

05:13.487 --> 05:15.053
Siri was supposed to remind me,

05:15.097 --> 05:16.707
but the bitch just hates me.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.362
I will bring it to you tomorrow.

05:19.406 --> 05:20.407
It's on my nightstand.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.147
Right next to
her Bible.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.106
Excuse me, miss, do you have

05:24.149 --> 05:25.934
deconstructed Tater Tots here

05:25.977 --> 05:27.762
or, uh, just Oreos?

05:27.805 --> 05:30.286
Hey, what are you doing here?

05:30.330 --> 05:31.548
Well, you mentioned
this meeting,

05:31.592 --> 05:32.984
I thought I'd
check it out.

05:33.028 --> 05:35.378
I'm glad you did.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.467
This is my daughter Christy.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.773
My friends Marjorie,
Wendy, Jill.

05:38.816 --> 05:41.166
Everybody, this is Joe.Hey, everybody.

05:41.210 --> 05:42.777
Hey, Joe.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.692
Well, come on, let's
find us some seats.

05:44.735 --> 05:45.823
Great.

05:45.867 --> 05:48.260
Hang on there,
Tater Tots.

05:48.304 --> 05:50.350
I'll be right there.

05:50.393 --> 05:51.873
Who's that?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.918
Oh, him? We met
at the food thing.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.267
What food thing?

05:55.311 --> 05:57.226
Boy, are you missing
the point of the story.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.796
I had to listen to you
yap all night about

06:01.839 --> 06:03.798
infused octopus balls,
and somehow

06:03.841 --> 06:05.408
man with balls
slipped your mind?

06:05.452 --> 06:08.498
What? I made a friend.
End of story.

06:08.542 --> 06:11.153
Did you tell him
about Adam?Yes, I did.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.546
Did you tell Adam
about him?

06:12.589 --> 06:16.419
I told him about Adam.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.639
You know, Bonnie,
when we keep secrets,

06:18.682 --> 06:20.075
we set a ball rolling,

06:20.118 --> 06:22.164
and it always rolls
downhill.

06:22.207 --> 06:24.427
What do you have,
a "motto of the day" calendar?

06:24.471 --> 06:25.820
Actually, I do.

06:27.604 --> 06:29.563
Well, there is no secret.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.739
I didn't mention it to Adam
because why make him jealous

06:31.782 --> 06:33.131
for no reason?

06:33.175 --> 06:34.742
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go sit

06:34.785 --> 06:37.005
with my new friend, who,
as far as I'm concerned,

06:37.048 --> 06:38.441
has no genitalia.

06:40.269 --> 06:43.446
Okay, who had eight months

06:43.490 --> 06:45.448
in the Bonnie-Adam breakup pool?

06:45.492 --> 06:47.537
Yeah, she is definitely
playing with fire.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.886
I agree.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.584
"Those things left unsaid

06:50.627 --> 06:52.716
often poison
the marriage bed."

06:52.760 --> 06:55.502
Okay, it's not cute
anymore, Marjorie.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.299
Who you texting?

07:10.342 --> 07:13.258
Uh, just a friend.

07:13.302 --> 07:15.086
Who?

07:16.218 --> 07:18.176
Suzanne.

07:18.220 --> 07:20.004
Have I met her?

07:20.048 --> 07:21.658
Are you kidding me?

07:21.702 --> 07:23.878
You sat next to her
at Jill's birthday party.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.357
I did?

07:25.401 --> 07:27.664
Honey, I'm worried
about you.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.014
She's vegan,
does driftwood art.

07:30.058 --> 07:31.451
You said she smelled funny.

07:32.930 --> 07:34.366
I really don't remember.

07:34.410 --> 07:37.935
Oh, that's sad, 'cause
she always asks about you.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.331
I'm gonna get
something to drink.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.031
Hey, Bonnie.

07:47.075 --> 07:48.206
Yeah?

07:48.250 --> 07:50.644
Tell Suzanne I said hi.

07:50.687 --> 07:53.429
Will do.

07:57.738 --> 07:58.782
Hey. How's it going?

07:58.826 --> 08:00.001
Terrible.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.003
I still can't find
Jill's necklace.

08:02.046 --> 08:04.701
I've looked in the bureau...Rhetorical!

08:06.529 --> 08:07.704
What are you doing?

08:07.748 --> 08:09.837
I'm Googling how
to fake a robbery.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.143
Ask me, I'm right here.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.668
[phone chimes]

08:16.496 --> 08:17.801
Who are you
texting so late?

08:17.845 --> 08:18.846
Just a friend.

08:21.588 --> 08:23.372
Not with that smile
on your face.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.680
You're texting that guy,
aren't you?

08:26.723 --> 08:28.246
It's not a big deal.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.118
We enjoy hanging out together.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.989
And that's it?That's it.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.381
And he invited me to dinner

08:33.424 --> 08:34.557
at his new restaurant tomorrow.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.298
Again, not a big deal.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.908
Then why don't you bring Adam?

08:37.952 --> 08:39.562
They don't have
anything in common.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.869
Sure they do-- they both have
the same girlfriend.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
The only thing that
could've made that meal better

08:48.571 --> 08:50.181
is if I could have
a cigarette right now.

08:50.225 --> 08:53.097
I would kill
for a cigarette.

08:53.141 --> 08:54.882
I'm gonna say something
controversial.

08:54.925 --> 08:57.275
Post-sex cigarette,
a little overrated.

08:57.319 --> 09:00.365
Post-beef cigarette,
magic!

09:03.325 --> 09:05.283
Well, thanks again.

09:05.327 --> 09:06.720
You're welcome.

09:06.763 --> 09:07.895
It's a great restaurant.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.418
Try not to burn it down.

09:09.461 --> 09:11.420
I will.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.248
I hope your daughter
enjoys the short ribs.

09:13.291 --> 09:14.989
Oh, these are never
gonna make it home.

09:15.032 --> 09:16.599
I'm gonna eat them
at the first red light.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.602
Can we do this again?

09:19.646 --> 09:21.691
Sure. I'd like that.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.041
Although,
I gotta tell you,

09:24.085 --> 09:26.348
my friends are giving me
a hard time

09:26.391 --> 09:27.697
about us hanging out.

09:27.741 --> 09:28.872
Yeah?

09:28.916 --> 09:31.658
They think something's
going on between us.

09:31.701 --> 09:34.138
I think they might be right.

09:38.273 --> 09:40.188
â™ª

09:46.977 --> 09:49.980
Mmm. Hang on.I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have done that.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.504
It's just...I-I get it. I totally get it.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.030
[both moaning]

09:58.598 --> 09:59.816
We have to stop.

09:59.860 --> 10:01.775
I have a boyfriend,
and you know that.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.342
I do, but I just keep feeling

10:04.386 --> 10:05.996
like there's something
going on here.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.826
There is, it's
called friendship.

10:09.870 --> 10:11.959
Does your boyfriend know
where you are right now?

10:12.002 --> 10:14.788
All right, I screwed up.

10:14.831 --> 10:16.006
I admit it.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.010
I like this,

10:20.054 --> 10:21.882
but I love Adam.

10:24.145 --> 10:26.538
I have to go.

10:31.108 --> 10:33.458
These are just
too good.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.244
â™ª

10:40.422 --> 10:41.641
Hey!

10:41.684 --> 10:43.207
What are you doing here?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.427
Ah, just dropping off
some flowers for your mom.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.994
Wait, what are you doing here?

10:47.037 --> 10:49.039
Bonnie told me you two
were going out for dinner.

10:49.083 --> 10:50.693
She did?Yeah.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.782
Oh, sure, right.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.697
But I ended up getting
called into work.

10:54.741 --> 10:57.047
See, Julie's stepfather died--
she's this girl I work with.

10:57.091 --> 10:59.093
I think he had an aneurysm.
She covered for me

10:59.136 --> 11:01.704
when I hurt my back, so I felt
like I had to do the same.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.706
I would've anyway--
I mean, he died.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.100
Man, aneurysms, huh?

11:06.143 --> 11:09.538
You're just walkin' along
and bam, game over.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.235
Is that a new jacket?

11:11.279 --> 11:12.497
No, no, it's not.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.064
So, where's your mom?

11:14.108 --> 11:16.501
Oh, she ended up going out
to dinner with Marjorie.

11:16.545 --> 11:17.894
Ah, okay.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.766
Do you mind
if I come in and wait?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.071
Sure.

11:21.115 --> 11:23.421
These are beautiful.

11:23.465 --> 11:27.034
Yeah, I needed to apologize for
being such a jerk the other day.

11:27.077 --> 11:30.559
You know what would really
make her feel better?

11:30.602 --> 11:32.126
You should get her
this necklace.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.129
By tomorrow.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.044
[chuckling]:
It's kind of pricey.

11:37.087 --> 11:38.785
I think I'm gonna stick
with the flowers.

11:38.828 --> 11:42.702
I thought you loved her,
but okay.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.531
Can I get you something
to drink?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.272
Uh, no, I'm good.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.534
You sure?

11:49.578 --> 11:50.971
70% of all Americans
are dehydrated;

11:51.014 --> 11:52.494
they don't even know it.
[chuckles]

11:52.537 --> 11:55.018
That settles it,
I'm getting you some water.

11:57.151 --> 11:58.674
You know, Adam,

11:58.718 --> 12:00.589
she and Marjorie might go
to a movie after dinner,

12:00.632 --> 12:02.634
so you could be
waiting a long time.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.375
That's okay,
I got nothing going on.

12:04.419 --> 12:06.943
[quietly]:
Of course you don't.

12:08.336 --> 12:09.554
Adam.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.078
What are you
doing here?

12:11.121 --> 12:12.296
Surprising my girlfriend.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.341
[nervous chuckle]

12:13.384 --> 12:14.951
You sure are.

12:14.995 --> 12:16.039
How was dinner?

12:16.083 --> 12:17.824
My dinner?[phone chimes]

12:17.867 --> 12:19.651
It was, uh, okay.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.610
I-- Christy ended up
having to go to work,

12:21.653 --> 12:24.526
so I went with Marjorie and she
was just blah, blah, blah, blah,

12:24.569 --> 12:25.570
sobriety.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.008
[chuckles]

12:28.051 --> 12:30.401
Oh, look who's back.

12:30.445 --> 12:31.881
Here you go.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.143
Just 'cause
I'm wearing this

12:33.187 --> 12:34.405
doesn't mean you
have to tip.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.972
But you can.

12:36.016 --> 12:38.235
Look, Adam brought you flowers.

12:38.279 --> 12:39.976
What a wonderful boyfriend.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.065
All right, good night.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.242
That's really
sweet of you.

12:45.286 --> 12:48.028
Hmm. So where'd you and Marjorie
go for dinner?

12:48.071 --> 12:49.899
Oh, a new place.

12:49.943 --> 12:50.987
How was it?

12:51.031 --> 12:53.033
The food was amazing.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.382
Maybe we should try it sometime.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.384
But not amazing in a good way.

12:56.427 --> 12:58.734
In fact, I should just
brush my teeth.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.218
Christy? Christy!

13:04.261 --> 13:05.741
Ugh. What?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.353
What are you doing?

13:09.397 --> 13:10.746
I'm looking for the necklace!

13:10.790 --> 13:12.269
Under there?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.750
I thought I saw
something shiny.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.145
It was just a Rolo wrapper.

13:18.188 --> 13:21.017
Well, that's it.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.063
I'm just gonna have to tell
Jill I lost it

13:23.106 --> 13:25.108
and hope someday
she needs a kidney.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.198
Joe kissed me.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.460
What?

13:29.504 --> 13:31.462
It was completely
out of the blue.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.248
I got to spit.

13:34.291 --> 13:35.902
How was it out of the blue?

13:35.945 --> 13:38.034
You were on a freakin' date.It was not a date.

13:38.078 --> 13:40.167
He pay for dinner?It was his restaurant.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.082
You shave your legs?I'm not an animal.

13:42.125 --> 13:43.039
Date!

13:43.083 --> 13:45.563
Okay, fine, it was a date.

13:45.607 --> 13:47.914
Oh, my God,
how am I gonna tell Adam?

13:47.957 --> 13:50.046
You're not.
What?

13:50.090 --> 13:51.613
Do you like Joe?

13:51.656 --> 13:53.267
Are you gonna go out
with him again?

13:53.310 --> 13:55.530
No, I am in love with Adam.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.314
Then don't blow it up
over one mistake

13:57.358 --> 13:58.620
that you're never
gonna make again.

13:58.663 --> 14:00.187
But I feel so guilty.

14:00.230 --> 14:01.449
And you should.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.885
But you don't get to hurt Adam

14:02.929 --> 14:04.191
just to make yourself
feel better.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.933
When did you get so smart?

14:06.976 --> 14:09.892
It's easy to fix
other people's problems.

14:09.936 --> 14:13.896
Meanwhile, I owe Jill $87,000.

14:16.507 --> 14:20.294
Crazy thought, did you try
looking in your jewelry box?

14:20.337 --> 14:22.078
Seriously, Mom?

14:22.122 --> 14:23.863
You're right, that was stupid.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.734
Anyway, thanks
for your help.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.218
[sighs]

14:31.261 --> 14:35.048
If it were there,
I would've had to kill myself.

14:35.091 --> 14:38.790
How'd you know these long blue
things are my favorites?

14:38.834 --> 14:41.445
I told the guy at the flower
shop I screwed up pretty bad,

14:41.489 --> 14:44.144
he said, "You're gonna want to
go with the long blue things."

14:44.187 --> 14:49.758
Well, thank you,
they're perfect.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.629
I'm really sorry
about last weekend.

14:51.673 --> 14:53.109
Hey, we all make mistakes.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.371
Let's move on.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.504
No, no, I-I want
to say this.

14:56.547 --> 14:59.681
From now on, if I tell you that
I'm gonna go with you somewhere,

14:59.724 --> 15:02.597
I'm gonna go, 'cause I know
that I can count on you,

15:02.640 --> 15:06.209
and you deserve the same.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.261
[sighs]

15:14.304 --> 15:16.567
A guy kissed me tonight.

15:16.611 --> 15:17.960
What?

15:18.004 --> 15:22.008
I wasn't at dinner
with Marjorie.

15:22.051 --> 15:24.967
I was with a guy I met
at the food festival.

15:25.011 --> 15:27.404
Hold on.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.972
[chuckles]

15:30.016 --> 15:31.234
You're seeing somebody else?

15:31.278 --> 15:33.715
Not seeing-- we're just friends.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.978
CHRISTY:
I found the necklace!Friends don't kiss.

15:36.022 --> 15:36.848
Bye.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.768
The important thing is
I stopped him.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.814
And that makes it okay?

15:45.857 --> 15:47.468
Well, the old Bonnie
would've slept with him

15:47.511 --> 15:48.817
without giving it
a second thought.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.558
You should be proud of me.

15:50.601 --> 15:52.212
Proud of you?

15:52.255 --> 15:53.865
Hey, I didn't shoot a puppy
today with a BB gun.

15:53.909 --> 15:55.389
Are you proud of me?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.869
Well, if you had a history
of shooting puppies,

15:57.913 --> 15:59.828
yeah, I would be.

15:59.871 --> 16:02.613
So tell me, what's the big
attraction for this guy, huh?

16:02.657 --> 16:05.051
Or are you just tired of being
with somebody in a wheelchair?

16:06.356 --> 16:07.967
That's what you think of me?

16:10.317 --> 16:14.625
You want to know
what I liked about him?

16:14.669 --> 16:16.018
He's sober.

16:16.062 --> 16:18.020
Oh, I should've guessed.
He's sober.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.675
I'm sorry, but there
is a difference.

16:20.718 --> 16:23.199
Sometimes when you're drinking
you can be right next to me

16:23.243 --> 16:25.506
and I feel completely alone.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.768
Yeah, well, I know another way

16:26.811 --> 16:28.030
to make you feel
completely alone.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.251
Are you kidding me?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.079
And I got news for you.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.691
It is also no picnic being
with someone who never drinks!

16:36.734 --> 16:38.562
Well, how would you know?
You'd be too hungover

16:38.606 --> 16:39.955
to even go to the picnic.

16:41.261 --> 16:45.221
Oh, my God, you made up
smelly Suzanne!

16:52.663 --> 16:54.056
Here you go,
one diamond necklace.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.405
Thank you.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.234
You all saw it, it is
officially returned.

16:58.278 --> 17:01.803
Oh, that is
so beautiful.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.327
I'll never own
anything that nice.

17:04.371 --> 17:05.589
Sure you will.

17:05.633 --> 17:06.851
Here.

17:06.895 --> 17:07.590
What?

17:08.636 --> 17:09.984
You're giving it to her?

17:10.029 --> 17:11.421
It's just a glass knock-off.

17:11.464 --> 17:13.423
I keep the real one
in a safe deposit box.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.339
Why didn't you tell me?!

17:16.383 --> 17:19.777
Well, if you knew it was fake,
you wouldn't feel special.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.040
Have you met me?

17:21.083 --> 17:22.824
I never feel special!

17:22.867 --> 17:25.305
Okay, well, next time I'll
let you borrow the real one.

17:25.348 --> 17:27.742
What are you trying
to do, kill me?

17:29.135 --> 17:31.224
Bonnie, stop
checking your phone.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.095
He'll call
when he calls.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.141
I don't know what I
was thinking with Joe.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.578
Well, maybe you
liked the danger.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.840
What are you
talking about?

17:38.883 --> 17:40.755
Oh, come on,
when we were drinking,

17:40.798 --> 17:42.670
our lives were
packed with drama.

17:42.713 --> 17:44.889
Sometimes when you're
sober, you miss that.

17:44.933 --> 17:46.587
I know I do.

17:46.630 --> 17:48.589
There was a time where
I'd pick up a glass of champagne

17:48.632 --> 17:50.112
in L.A. and wake up in Paris.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.375
Same thing
happened to me,

17:52.419 --> 17:55.074
except I woke up
in a panel van.

17:59.600 --> 18:02.081
I sure don't
miss the drama.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.735
Waking up with no idea
where my car is,

18:04.779 --> 18:07.608
or who autographed
my boob with a Sharpie.

18:07.651 --> 18:10.393
Oh, I bet you were
a fun drunk.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.439
You'd think, but no.

18:13.570 --> 18:15.355
[phone chimes]

18:15.398 --> 18:17.226
Oh, God, it's Adam.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.798
He said he'll be...

18:23.841 --> 18:25.626
[chuckles] out of his
apartment this afternoon

18:25.669 --> 18:28.063
[voice breaking]: and I can
come pick up my stuff.

18:31.414 --> 18:33.329
Oh, Bonnie.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.984
[sighs]

18:37.855 --> 18:39.988
The only relationship
that lasts forever

18:40.031 --> 18:43.209
is the one we have
with ourselves.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.427
[clicks tongue]

18:50.520 --> 18:52.392
Yeah, I deserved that.
