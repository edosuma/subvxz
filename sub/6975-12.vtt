- You're Scully and Doggett, right?
- Yes.

03:53.213 --> 03:54.908
Agent Scully needed
to examine the body...

03:54.981 --> 03:56.005
of the victim first.

03:56.049 --> 03:58.108
Who's missing
the picture here?

03:58.184 --> 04:00.880
I got lots of people

04:00.954 --> 04:02.717
What I need from
the FBI now...

04:02.789 --> 04:03.653
is a time frame.

04:03.723 --> 04:04.655
A time frame?

04:04.724 --> 04:06.521
One of the main arteries...

Oh, yes, I can.

04:46.733 --> 04:48.598
that tunnel cannot
be reopened.

We understand
the FBI's need to do...

04:50.737 --> 04:52.295
a thorough investigation,
but as I see it...

04:52.339 --> 04:54.830
the facts of this case
are actually pretty simple.

04:54.874 --> 04:56.364
Simple?

04:56.610 --> 04:58.009
The train briefly lost power...

04:58.044 --> 05:01.241

killed a Boston transit cop.

05:04.050 --> 05:05.642
Acid, lye.

Your examination of the victim
must've told us something.

05:08.922 --> 05:10.321
No, it didn't,
that's the thing.

05:10.390 --> 05:12.950
Until we culture the tissue
and run the proper tests...

05:13.026 --> 05:14.891
we're not going to know
what killed him...

They found no trace of
biological or chemical agents.

Agent Scully?

15:43.022 --> 15:45.513
Yeah, I see them.
Can you get any closer?

15:46.859 --> 15:49.453
Smell's a little overpowering.

15:49.528 --> 15:53.328
They've been here for a while.

15:53.399 --> 15:56.766
Looks like someone wrapped them up
and stashed them down here.

15:56.802 --> 15:58.736
Can you get them uncovered?

16:00.473 --> 16:02.498

from the way they're dressed.

I want you to leave those bodies
where you found them...

who's in that tunnel.

We need to know whether he is
causing this...

18:31.957 --> 18:34.585
or if he's infected himself.

18:34.660 --> 18:37.925
Either way,
he may kill more people.

Your saltwater sample
was rather deceiving.

27:50.482 --> 27:53.042
Its components are exactly
as you'd expect...

27:53.118 --> 27:54.517

This creature is
primarily that.

27:56.688 --> 27:57.985
Calcium?

27:58.056 --> 27:59.580
Yes, it's what powers...

27:59.658 --> 28:02.718

bioluminescence.

28:02.961 --> 28:06.158

this is a sea creature?

28:06.198 --> 28:09.634

the CDC missed it.

people's flesh off.

28:29.254 --> 28:31.347

some kind of a reaction...
