WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.265
WAIT, OK. HOLD ON.
REALITY CHECK.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.397
YOU'RE NOT MAD AT ADAM,
AND HE JUST UP AND TOOK OFF?

00:06.397 --> 00:08.399
YOU'RE NOT MAD
THAT HE LEFT THE COUNTRY?

00:08.399 --> 00:10.358
I MEAN, AFTER SAYING--
SAYING NOTHING?

00:10.358 --> 00:12.925
NO, NO. IF HE WANTS
TO BLOW OFF STEAM
FOR A WEEK,

00:12.925 --> 00:14.362
THAT'S FINE.
I MEAN, IF HE THINKS

00:14.362 --> 00:16.929
HE'S GONNA GET HAPPY
AT SOME MEXICAN
ARTIST'S COLONY,

00:16.929 --> 00:18.061
THEN I SUPPORT THAT.
I'M JUST--

00:18.061 --> 00:20.368
I'M MAD 'CAUSE HE LEFT
AFTER SAYING SO MUCH.

00:20.368 --> 00:21.934
OK, I DON'T
UNDERSTAND THIS.

00:21.934 --> 00:23.414
WELL, SEE, WE GOT
IN THIS BIG FIGHT,

00:23.414 --> 00:24.546
AND HE KEPT SAYING
ALL THESE THINGS

00:24.546 --> 00:25.590
THAT CAME WAY OUT
OF LEFT FIELD,

00:25.590 --> 00:26.635
AND BEFORE
I COULD FIGURE OUT

00:26.635 --> 00:28.593
HOW I WANTED
TO RESPOND,
HE WAS GONE.

00:28.593 --> 00:30.247
OUT OF LEFT FIELD?
LIKE WHAT?

00:30.247 --> 00:32.641
WELL, LIKE--
HERE, THANK YOU.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.557
LIKE I'M NOT
LIVING MY LIFE
LIKE I SHOULD,

00:35.557 --> 00:37.385
OR--OR WRITING
TO MY POTENTIAL
OR SOMETHING,

00:37.385 --> 00:40.083
'CAUSE I KEEP DOING THINGS
FOR OTHER PEOPLE
INSTEAD OF MYSELF.

00:40.083 --> 00:43.260
YEAH, BUT, I MEAN,
WHAT IS THIS BASED ON,
REALLY?

00:43.260 --> 00:45.306
WELL, HE THINKS
I DROPPED MY BOOK

00:45.306 --> 00:47.743
BECAUSE ONE OR 2 PEOPLE
REJECTED IT, YOU KNOW,

00:47.743 --> 00:49.136
AND THEN IF I REALLY
BELIEVED IN IT,

00:49.136 --> 00:50.572
THEN I WOULDN'T CARE
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK,

00:50.572 --> 00:52.008
AND I WOULD KEEP
SUBMITTING IT.

00:52.008 --> 00:54.228
HUH. I--I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU DROPPED IT.

00:54.228 --> 00:55.490
NO, I--I DIDN'T.

00:55.490 --> 00:59.059
I'M JUST
NOT DONE WITH IT YET.
IT'S GOT PROBLEMS.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.539
REALLY? LIKE WHAT?

01:01.539 --> 01:03.976
I DON'T KNOW, CLAUD.

01:03.976 --> 01:05.891
IT'S JUST
NOT WORKING SOMEHOW.

01:05.891 --> 01:06.892
I MEAN,
PEOPLE READ IT,

01:06.892 --> 01:08.024
AND THEY DON'T
QUITE GET IT.

01:09.721 --> 01:11.593
WELL, THEY DON'T,

01:11.593 --> 01:13.595
'CAUSE OTHERWISE,
THEY WOULD
PUBLISH IT, RIGHT?

01:13.595 --> 01:15.553
I MEAN, HOW ELSE
AM I SUPPOSED
TO JUDGE IT?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.079
I DON'T KNOW, CLAUD.
DO YOU THINK
HE'S RIGHT?

01:19.079 --> 01:20.254
I'M, LIKE,
GETTING HUNG UP?

01:20.254 --> 01:21.255
JULIA, QUIET.

01:21.255 --> 01:23.518
WHAT, CLAUDIA?

01:41.927 --> 01:42.928
COME OVER HERE.

01:42.928 --> 01:43.929
OH, MY GOD.

01:43.929 --> 01:44.930
DON'T LET HIM SEE YOU.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.367
WHAT'S HE
DOING HERE, CLAUD?

01:46.367 --> 01:47.977
I DON'T KNOW.
LET'S GO.
OK.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.761
PLEASE, JUST
GET IN THE CAR,
AND LET'S GO.

@YOUR LAWYER.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.623
@IT SEEMS THAT@THE ONE THING

03:52.623 --> 03:56.453
@THAT YOU CAN'T DO@ON A STUDENT VISA@IS WORK FULL TIME,

03:56.453 --> 04:00.240
@AND THAT HAPPENS@TO BE THE WAY@THAT I PAY MY RENT.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.157
@SO?@SO...

04:05.157 --> 04:07.812
@MY STUDENT VISA'S@BEEN REVOKED.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.249
@THEY SAY@THAT I CAN STAY

04:09.249 --> 04:10.250
@UNTIL AFTER@THE EXAMS,

04:10.250 --> 04:13.253
@BUT AFTER THAT,@I'M GONE.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.038

04:16.038 --> 04:17.213
@GONE, YOU MEAN,@BACK TO ENGLAND?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.128
@YEP.

04:19.128 --> 04:20.260
@WHEN?

04:21.957 --> 04:23.437
A FEW WEEKS.

04:23.437 --> 04:24.525
BUT, THAT'S--

04:26.440 --> 04:28.485
NO. NO--NO--NO--
NO--NO. WE'LL--

04:28.485 --> 04:31.053
WE HAVE TO CALL SOMEBODY.
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.707
I'VE BEEN WITH
MY LAWYER ALL DAY,

04:32.707 --> 04:35.187
AND HE'S DOING
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE,
ALL RIGHT?

04:35.187 --> 04:37.015
NO,
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.016
THEY CAN'T
KICK ME OUT.

04:38.016 --> 04:39.627
WE BOTH
KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

04:39.627 --> 04:40.715
YEAH.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.456
SO, I HAVE TO BELIEVE
THIS IS GONNA WORK.

04:42.456 --> 04:45.372
I HAVE TO BELIEVE IT.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.899
[ALARM RINGS]

04:50.899 --> 04:53.293
OH, I THINK YOU WANT
TO WAKE UP.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.860
LOOK.

04:57.906 --> 04:59.211
WHAT'S THIS?

04:59.211 --> 05:03.085
SPINACH OMELETTE,
BRIOCHE,
SWEET CREAM BUTTER,

05:03.085 --> 05:06.349
RASPBERRY PRESERVES,
AND COFFEE.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.657
WOW. THIS IS...

05:09.657 --> 05:11.572
WHY?

05:11.572 --> 05:13.008
I THINK YOU KNOW.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.489
THIS IS
A VERY SPECIAL DAY.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.404
IT IS?
MM-MMM.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.884
THINK BACK.
WHAT HAPPENED
A YEAR AGO TODAY?

05:19.884 --> 05:22.104
UM...

05:22.104 --> 05:23.105
CAN YOU GIVE ME A HINT?

05:23.105 --> 05:26.543
YOU DON'T KNOW?
YOU HAVE NO IDEA?

05:26.543 --> 05:30.547
NO, I DO, I DO.
I JUST--

05:30.547 --> 05:31.505
I JUST NEED A HINT.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.550
BOY, SO MUCH
FOR ROMANCE.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.725
WELL, KIRSTEN,
WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT.

05:34.725 --> 05:35.726
NO, IT'S
NO BIG DEAL.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.249
IT'S JUST,
A YEAR AGO TODAY

05:37.249 --> 05:38.903
WE GOT BACK
TOGETHER,
THAT'S ALL.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.862
KIRSTEN, HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

05:40.862 --> 05:45.997
I'M SORRY.
IF I DIDN'T HAVE
ALL THIS FACTORY STUFF

05:45.997 --> 05:48.739
AND I'D HAD
A DECENT NIGHT'S SLEEP
IN THE LAST MONTH,

05:48.739 --> 05:51.481
I'D HAVE REMEMBERED.

05:51.481 --> 05:54.310
I KNOW IT'S NOT
AN OFFICIAL ANNIVERSARY
OR ANYTHING,

05:54.310 --> 05:56.660
BUT WE'VE
JUST BEEN SO BUSY,

05:56.660 --> 05:57.966
@AND I JUST THOUGHT@IT WAS A GOOD EXCUSE

05:57.966 --> 05:59.750
@FOR US TO HAVE@SOME FUN TOGETHER.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.665
@OK, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

06:01.665 --> 06:04.407
@HOW ABOUT IF I BLOW OFF@MY CONTRACTOR'S MEETING@TONIGHT,

06:04.407 --> 06:06.191
@AND WE'LL CELEBRATE THEN?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.758
@THAT'S OK. YOU DON'T@HAVE TO DO THAT.

06:07.758 --> 06:08.846
@NO--NO--NO,@I WANT TO.

06:08.846 --> 06:10.500
@YOU'RE MY WIFE,@AND I LOVE YOU.

06:12.154 --> 06:14.374
@SO, ARE WE OK?

06:17.768 --> 06:20.467
@THEN, CAN I HAVE@MY BREAKFAST BACK?

06:25.297 --> 06:26.516
@SO, I THOUGHT@THAT ROSS WOULD BE

06:26.516 --> 06:27.691
@A GOOD PERSON@FOR YOU TO TALK TO,

06:27.691 --> 06:29.476
@'CAUSE HE'S BEEN@THROUGH A LOT

06:29.476 --> 06:32.087
@OF WHAT YOU'RE@GOING THROUGH@WITH CHARLOTTE.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.263
@I THOUGHT YOU SAID@TESS WAS ADOPTED.

06:34.263 --> 06:37.658
@SHE WAS,@BUT THE CUSTODY ISSUES@ARE SIMILAR,

06:37.658 --> 06:39.094
@ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE@A SINGLE PARENT.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.791
@WHICH HE DEFINITELY IS.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.446
YOU'RE SINGLE.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.536
ANYWAY, I HAVE A LAWYER
WHOSE MAIN PRACTICE

06:46.536 --> 06:49.147
IS CUSTODY ISSUES
FOR SINGLE GAY MEN,
IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.715
OK. OH, YEAH,
HE IS. DEFINITELY.

06:54.892 --> 06:57.242
OK, YOU REALLY NEED
TO NOT BE

06:57.242 --> 06:58.766
SETTING ME UP
WITH THE VIOLIN TEACHER.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.637
WHAT? I'M NOT.

07:00.637 --> 07:06.251
PLEASE. "VICTOR'S SINGLE.
VICTOR'S INTERESTED."
WHAT WAS THAT?

07:06.251 --> 07:10.734
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
YOU AND CHARLOTTE,
NOT YOU AND ROSS.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.823
HEY, NOW THAT YOU
MENTION IT, WHY NOT?

07:12.823 --> 07:14.869
YOU SHOULD GO OUT,
YOU'RE BOTH SINGLE.

07:14.869 --> 07:16.740
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.438
YOU BOTH HAVE DAUGHTERS
THE SAME AGE,

07:18.438 --> 07:20.614
ROSS IS A MUSICIAN,
YOU LOVE MUSIC.

07:20.614 --> 07:23.094
EVERYONE LOVES MUSIC.

07:23.094 --> 07:25.183
DOGS AND CATS
LOVE MUSIC.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.055
YOU'RE THE ONE
ALWAYS COMPLAINING
ABOUT YOUR LOVE LIFE.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.231
I AM NOT.

07:29.231 --> 07:32.103
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
BUT THAT
DOESN'T MEAN

07:32.103 --> 07:33.104
THAT I'M SUPPOSED
TO FALL

07:33.104 --> 07:34.236
FOR THE ONLY
OTHER GAY MAN

07:34.236 --> 07:36.847
THAT YOU
HAPPEN TO KNOW
IN SAN FRANCISCO.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.022
WHY NOT?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.025
BECAUSE LOVE
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY,

07:41.025 --> 07:42.026
THAT'S WHY NOT.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.593
IT DOESN'T
WORK THAT WAY

07:43.593 --> 07:44.986
IF YOU DON'T LET IT.

07:44.986 --> 07:48.119
HONEY, LOVE
DOESN'T CARE WHAT I DO.
LOVE JUST HAPPENS.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.121
YOU CAN'T MAKE IT HAPPEN,
OR SET IT UP,

07:50.121 --> 07:51.296
BECAUSE THE MINUTE
YOU START DOING THAT,

07:51.296 --> 07:53.473
IT'S NOT LOVE ANYMORE.
IT'S WORK.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.170
AND BESIDES,
HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.606
WHY NOT?

07:56.606 --> 07:58.434
WHY NOT? VICTOR,
HE'S MY BEST FRIEND.

07:58.434 --> 07:59.609
HE'S SMART, HE'S SWEET.

07:59.609 --> 08:03.657
EXACTLY. HE'S SWEET.
HE'S SMART.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.224
HE'S SMART AND SWEET,
WHICH FOR ME, IT'S UGH--

08:06.224 --> 08:12.492
IT'S TOO SWEET.
IT'S TOO SMART,
YOU KNOW?

08:12.492 --> 08:16.974
OK...SO, TELL ME,
ANYTHING YET?

08:16.974 --> 08:18.976
YOU HEARD FROM
YOUR LAWYER?

08:18.976 --> 08:20.804
YUP.

08:20.804 --> 08:21.979
AND?

08:23.459 --> 08:24.460
IT'S NOT GOOD.

08:24.460 --> 08:25.461
IS IT GOOD?

08:25.461 --> 08:27.332
IT'S NOT GREAT.

08:27.332 --> 08:28.856
HE SAID HE'D APPEAL,

08:28.856 --> 08:31.511
BUT THEY DON'T
OFTEN OVERTURN
THEIR DECISIONS,

08:31.511 --> 08:36.994
SO...FOR NOW,
I JUST HAVE TO SIT
TIGHT AND WAIT.

08:36.994 --> 08:40.520
HOLLY, WAIT?
WAIT FOR WHAT?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.000
TILL YOU'RE ON A PLANE
BACK TO LONDON?

08:43.000 --> 08:45.176
TILL YOUR SLOT AT STANFORD'S
BEEN GIVEN AWAY?

08:45.176 --> 08:46.874
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO,

08:46.874 --> 08:50.442
PHONE PRESIDENT CLINTON,
OR CHAIN MYSELF TO
THE BRITISH EMBASSY?

08:50.442 --> 08:52.053
OK, LOOK...

08:54.969 --> 08:59.190
I'VE DONE SOME RESEARCH
INTO YOUR SITUATION
HERE, OK?

08:59.190 --> 09:02.324
AND THERE ARE WAYS
AROUND THIS THING.

09:02.324 --> 09:06.546
NOT THAT IT'S ANYTHING
WE WOULD DO IF WE WEREN'T
TOTALLY IN A JAM HERE.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.373
I HAD A FEELING THIS
WAS GONNA COME UP.

09:08.373 --> 09:12.203
YEAH, BUT IF YOUR
ONLY OPTION IS GOING
BACK TO ENGLAND...

09:12.203 --> 09:14.031
WE COULD DO IT.
I MEAN, WE COULD--

09:14.031 --> 09:15.903
WE COULD MAKE THEM
BUY THIS THING.

09:15.903 --> 09:17.557
IT'S NOT THAT MUCH
OF A STRETCH.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.167
YEAH, WE COULD MAKE
'EM BUY IT, BUT...

09:19.167 --> 09:21.778
DO WE REALLY WANT THIS?
DO WE REALLY WANT THAT
KIND OF PRESSURE?

09:21.778 --> 09:23.563
WE HAVE JUST GOT
BACK TOGETHER, BAILEY.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.653
WHAT KIND OF PRESSURE?
WE'D JUST BE PRETENDING
A LITTLE.

09:26.653 --> 09:29.220
BUT IT'S A HELL OF
A LOT TO PRETEND.

09:29.220 --> 09:31.092
I MEAN, PEOPLE GET
CAUGHT DOING THIS.

09:31.092 --> 09:33.660
I COULD GET DEPORTED,
AND YOU COULD GET
SENT TO PRISON.

WHO GET CAUGHT DOING
THIS KIND OF THING

09:35.749 --> 09:37.881
ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T
ACTUALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

BEING PRESSURED INTO
SAYING SOMETHING

09:47.064 --> 09:49.763

PROBABLY DON'T MEAN.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.460
NO, THAT'S NOT...

09:51.460 --> 09:55.116
THE POINT IS,
IT'S BETTER THAN YOU
HAVING TO LEAVE.

09:55.116 --> 09:58.946
RIGHT? AND WE DON'T HAVE
TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT
OF THIS THING AT ALL.

CLOTHES AND A TOOTHBRUSH
AND KEEP 'EM AT MY PLACE.

THE SAME.

WE STILL HAVE
OUR SEPARATE LIVES.

10:06.431 --> 10:09.260

EACH OTHER WHEN WE
WANT TO SEE EACH OTHER.

BE REMINDING YOU.

I'M EXPECTING TO SEE HIM.

OUT THE WINDOW BEFORE
I LEAVE THE HOUSE.

HIS ADDRESS.

I COULD JUST GO.

THIS MORNING,

TOWARDS HIS PLACE,

11:02.966 --> 11:04.794
AND THEN I LOST
MY NERVE.

11:04.794 --> 11:05.795
WHOSE PLACE?

OH, JUST, UM...
A FRIEND OF JULIA'S.

11:08.842 --> 11:13.063

A NEW BOYFRIEND
OR SOMETHING?

TO HIDE THAT STUFF
FROM ME.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.806
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S NED.

WE SAW HIM AT
A STORE YESTERDAY.

OF BLOCKS FROM HERE.

A YEAR OFF, WORKING
AT HIS DAD'S OFFICE,

11:29.166 --> 11:31.038
AND SEEING
A PSYCHIATRIST.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.040
HE'S NOT HERE
TO COME AFTER ME.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.303
YOU JUST SAID YOU
WERE GOING OVER
TO HIS PLACE.

11:35.303 --> 11:37.131
YEAH, WELL, IT'S BETTER
TO BUMP INTO HIM
WHEN I'M READY

11:37.131 --> 11:38.654
AND NOT WHEN
IT'S AN ACCIDENT.

11:38.654 --> 11:39.829
JULIA, DON'T.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.004
WHY NOT?

11:41.004 --> 11:42.179
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE
TO ASK ME THAT?!

NOT A MURDERER.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.139
HE'S NOT GONNA DRAG
ME OFF INTO SOME ALLEY.

11:45.139 --> 11:46.706

SCARED TO SEE HIM?

11:46.706 --> 11:50.361
I'M NOT. I'M NOT...
PHYSICALLY SCARED
OF HIM.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.189
I'M NOT SCARED
HE'S GONNA HURT ME.

EXCUSES FOR HIM.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.805

DON'T SEE HIM.

18:48.344 --> 18:50.129
OK? BUT I'M NOT GONNA
WAKE UP ONE DAY

18:50.129 --> 18:51.608
AND FIND MYSELF
TRAPPED IN SOMETHING

18:51.608 --> 18:53.523
THAT I DON'T
WANT TO BE IN.

18:53.523 --> 18:56.047
WE'RE JUST 2 PEOPLE
THAT ARE DATING
THAT HAPPEN TO HAVE--

18:56.047 --> 18:57.353
HEY, SLOW DOWN,
SLOW DOWN.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.094
LIKE,
A LEGAL ARRANGEMENT.
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO--

18:59.094 --> 19:00.574
BAILEY!

19:00.574 --> 19:02.097
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.316
YOU DO?

19:03.316 --> 19:05.709
YES.

19:05.709 --> 19:08.973
THE ONE THING
YOU'RE NOT TOTALLY
UP IN THE AIR ABOUT

19:08.973 --> 19:10.453
IS HER.

19:10.453 --> 19:14.327
MAN...IF I FELT
THE WAY YOU DID...

19:14.327 --> 19:17.156
I WOULD MARRY THAT GIRL
IN A HEARTBEAT.

19:21.072 --> 19:24.119
SO, HE SEEMS GREAT--
VICTOR.

19:25.207 --> 19:28.123
HE IS. HE'S...

19:28.123 --> 19:29.559
GREAT.

19:29.559 --> 19:31.170
DID HE HAPPEN TO
SAY ANYTHING?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.345
OH, NOT REALLY.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.476
YEAH.

19:33.476 --> 19:35.652
YOU WANT TO HELP ME
WITH THIS?

19:39.134 --> 19:40.309
SO NOTHING ELSE--

19:40.309 --> 19:41.658
ABOUT ME?

19:41.658 --> 19:42.833
YES, ACTUALLY.

19:42.833 --> 19:44.879
HE SAID THAT, UM,

19:44.879 --> 19:47.186
YOU WERE INCREDIBLY...

19:47.186 --> 19:49.057
HELPFUL.

19:49.057 --> 19:50.537
HELPFUL? HUH.

19:50.537 --> 19:52.060
WELL, ANYTHING ELSE?

19:52.060 --> 19:54.062
YEAH. HE SAID
THAT YOU WERE, UH,

19:54.062 --> 19:56.369
YOU KNOW, VERY SWEET
AND SMART.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.326
SMART AND SWEET.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.502
WOW, HE MUST HAVE
REALLY HATED ME.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.852
NO, HE DID NOT
HATE YOU.

20:01.852 --> 20:04.855
YOU'RE JUST
NOT HIS TYPE.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.553
REALLY?
WHAT'S HIS TYPE?

20:06.553 --> 20:08.729
I JUST THINK THAT
VICTOR HAS THIS THING
FOR ANGRY GUYS.

20:08.729 --> 20:10.731
OH, NO, NO, NO,
I GET IT, BELIEVE ME.

20:10.731 --> 20:12.036
I GET IT
ALL THE TIME.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.734
WHY IS IT
THAT GUYS JUST ASSUME

20:13.734 --> 20:15.649
THAT IF YOU HAPPEN
TO LIKE TO HAVE
YOUR SHIRTS PRESSED--

20:15.649 --> 20:16.867
ROSS, THAT IS NOT IT.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.523
VICTOR DOESN'T LIKE
BEING SET UP.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.265
HE DOESN'T
BELIEVE IN IT.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.224
HE THINKS THAT LOVE
IS SOMETHING--

20:25.224 --> 20:28.096
I DON'T KNOW--
HE THINKS IT SHOULD BE
AN ACCIDENT OR SOMETHING.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.104
SHE SAID THE PEOPLE
AT THE BASE ARE GREAT,

20:36.104 --> 20:37.584
BUT SHE DOESN'T
KNOW THEM.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.586
AND LUKE'S FAMILY
ASKED HER
TO STAY WITH THEM

20:39.586 --> 20:41.588
WHEN HE'S OUT OF TOWN,
BUT SHE DOESN'T REALLY
KNOW THEM, EITHER.

20:41.588 --> 20:43.242
SO BASICALLY
SHE AND DIANA

20:43.242 --> 20:44.547
ARE ALL BY THEMSELVES
OUT THERE.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.157
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

20:46.157 --> 20:47.158
CHARLIE, THEY'RE SLEEPING.

20:47.158 --> 20:48.769
I'M SORRY.

20:49.857 --> 20:51.206
HELLO.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.861
HEY, SID,
WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.604
NO. YARSKY'S SCHEDULED,

20:57.604 --> 21:00.346
BUT IF HE DOESN'T SHOW,
JUST ASK KENNEDY
IF HE CAN WORK THIRD SHIFT.

21:00.346 --> 21:04.741
AND, UH, IF NOT,
THEN WE'LL HAVE TO
PICK UP THE SLACK TOMORROW.

21:04.741 --> 21:06.743
OK.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.223
THANKS, SID.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.356
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

21:10.356 --> 21:11.748
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA TELL THEM

21:11.748 --> 21:13.620
THEY WEREN'T SUPPOSED
TO CALL PAST MIDNIGHT.

21:13.620 --> 21:17.058
I DID, BUT, YOU KNOW,
IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY...

21:18.320 --> 21:20.191
I'M SORRY.
WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?

21:20.191 --> 21:22.281
I'M JUST WORRIED
ABOUT HER.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.108
WELL, DON'T BE.

21:24.108 --> 21:26.110
I'VE HAD FRIENDS
IN THE ARMY.

21:26.110 --> 21:28.287
AND AS SOON AS LUKE
GETS ESTABLISHED OUT THERE,

21:28.287 --> 21:30.071
HE'LL BE ABLE TO PICK
HIS OWN HOURS.

21:30.071 --> 21:32.073
DAPHNE JUST HAS TO BE
PATIENT.

21:32.073 --> 21:35.076
YEAH, BUT HOW LONG
IS SHE SUPPOSED TO WAIT?

21:35.076 --> 21:36.599
6 MONTHS? A YEAR?

21:36.599 --> 21:37.948
SHE'S ALL ALONE
WITH A CHILD

21:37.948 --> 21:40.299
IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE, CHARLIE.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.563
SHE'S THINKING
OF MOVING BACK,
AND MAYBE SHE SHOULD.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.565
KIRSTEN, SHE'S ONLY
BEEN GONE A MONTH.

21:45.565 --> 21:47.218
AND LUKE'S JUST
DOING HIS JOB.

21:47.218 --> 21:48.916
I MEAN,
WHAT DOES SHE EXPECT?

21:48.916 --> 21:50.221
I DON'T KNOW.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.572
BUT IF HE WANTS HER
TO BE THERE
WHEN HE GETS HOME,

21:52.572 --> 21:54.269
HE BETTER
THINK OF SOMETHING.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.411
SO, AT FIRST
I WAS THINKING

22:05.411 --> 22:07.804
JUST, YOU KNOW,
A SIMPLE LITTLE
CEREMONY

22:07.804 --> 22:09.066
AT THE CITY HALL.

22:09.066 --> 22:11.808
YOU, ME,
AND THE COMMISSIONER
OF CIVIL MARRIAGES.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.376
BUT...THEN I WAS
TALKING TO WILL--

22:14.376 --> 22:15.377
WILL?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.378
YEAH.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.510
YOU TOLD WILL?

22:17.510 --> 22:19.599
I THOUGHT WE WEREN'T
GOING TO TELL ANYONE.

22:19.599 --> 22:21.165
HE FOUND OUT
BY ACCIDENT. OK?

22:21.165 --> 22:22.341
BUT THEN I THOUGHT,

22:22.341 --> 22:23.342
WHY NOT?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.995
WELL, BECAUSE
WE DISCUSSED THIS.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.997
WE SAID THAT WE DIDN'T
WANT THIS TO TAKE ON

22:26.997 --> 22:28.651
A WHOLE UGLY LIFE
OF ITS OWN, BAILEY.

22:28.651 --> 22:30.958
OK, BUT, HOLLY,
RELAX. RELAX.

22:30.958 --> 22:32.481
I KNOW THAT THIS
IS JUST PRETEND.

22:32.481 --> 22:35.005
OK? BUT IT HAS TO BE
GOOD PRETEND.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.267
AND IT
HAS TO LOOK REAL.

22:36.267 --> 22:38.269
THAT MEANS
YOU AND ME SMILING

22:38.269 --> 22:41.882
AND ENJOYING OURSELVES
FOR THE CAMERA.

22:41.882 --> 22:43.753
WHICH MEANS...

22:43.753 --> 22:45.842
IF WE JUST RELAX AND...

22:45.842 --> 22:48.279
YOU KNOW,
ENJOY OURSELVES
A LITTLE BIT,

22:48.279 --> 22:50.543
YOU KNOW, WE'LL DO
OUR JOBS BETTER.

22:50.543 --> 22:54.155
AND...MAYBE WE CAN
EVEN HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

22:56.244 --> 22:57.680
YEAH.

22:59.073 --> 22:59.813
YEAH.

22:59.813 --> 23:00.988
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:00.988 --> 23:03.556
THERE'S NO REASON WHY
THIS SHOULDN'T BE FUN.

23:03.556 --> 23:04.644
OK.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.472
ALL RIGHT.
SO THEN FOR
THE HONEYMOON,

23:06.472 --> 23:07.473
I WAS THINKING--

23:07.473 --> 23:08.952
AHEM. HONEYMOON?

23:08.952 --> 23:10.389
MAYBE WE COULD
DRIVE UP TO NAPA.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.129
I GOT AN INCREDIBLE
DISCOUNT AT--

23:12.129 --> 23:13.479

23:13.479 --> 23:15.045

23:15.045 --> 23:17.744

THE FIRST THING
THE I.N.S. ASKS FOR?

23:17.744 --> 23:19.223
IT'S PICTURES.

23:19.223 --> 23:22.226

THEIR HONEYMOON

23:22.226 --> 23:24.577

IN FRONT OF...

23:27.144 --> 23:29.016

23:33.847 --> 23:35.675

23:35.675 --> 23:37.328

23:37.328 --> 23:38.808
OK.

23:42.203 --> 23:43.465

23:43.465 --> 23:44.466
LOOK, CALM DOWN.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.033
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.687
YOU RAN OUT
BEFORE I COULD
ANSWER YOU, JULIA.

23:47.687 --> 23:48.731
I JUST HAVE
2 WORDS.

23:48.731 --> 23:49.863
I DON'T CARE.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.212
NO.

23:51.212 --> 23:52.692
I SPENT HALF MY TIME
LAST YEAR

23:52.692 --> 23:54.171
LISTENING TO YOUR WORDS, NED.
THEY'RE JUST WORDS.

23:54.171 --> 23:55.346
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.826
BUT CAN'T I JUST--

23:56.826 --> 23:59.394
TELL YOU I'M SORRY?

24:05.095 --> 24:07.837
I SAW SOMEONE
AFTER WE BROKE UP.

24:07.837 --> 24:09.839
MIRANDA.

24:09.839 --> 24:11.537
WE WENT OUT
6 MONTHS.

24:11.537 --> 24:14.453
BUT AFTER SHE
TOLD PEOPLE ABOUT US...

24:16.063 --> 24:17.325
ABOUT ME--

24:17.325 --> 24:21.547
I SPENT--I SPENT
2 WEEKS IN JAIL.

24:21.547 --> 24:24.201

HE PRACTICALLY SPAT AT ME

24:24.201 --> 24:26.334
READING MY SENTENCE.

24:26.334 --> 24:28.336
YOU KNOW, I KNOW...

24:28.336 --> 24:30.643
I HAVE PROBLEMS.
I KNOW THAT.

24:32.079 --> 24:34.647
BUT I WASN'T
LYING TO YOU.

24:34.647 --> 24:36.736
I AM ACTUALLY
TRYING.

24:36.736 --> 24:39.869
I SAW A DOCTOR.
I'M SEEING A DOCTOR.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.830
AND I MADE A PROMISE.

24:43.830 --> 24:47.486
I'M NOT GONNA BE
WITH ANYONE--ANYONE...

24:47.486 --> 24:49.488
UNTIL I KNOW...

24:49.488 --> 24:51.881

STOP LOOKING AT ME

TO MEET ME HERE AFTER SCHOOL.

TO THE MUSIC SCHOOL.

26:25.801 --> 26:27.107

26:28.151 --> 26:29.631
THAT'S OK, CLAUD.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.590
VICTOR'S THE ONLY ONE HERE
WITH A PROBLEM.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.766
EXCUSE ME?

26:33.766 --> 26:34.941
I'M SORRY.

26:34.941 --> 26:37.334
I GUESS THAT WASN'T
VERY SMART...

26:37.334 --> 26:38.858
OR SWEET.

26:38.858 --> 26:41.425
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

26:41.425 --> 26:42.905
LOOK, DON'T GET MAD
AT CLAUDIA.

26:42.905 --> 26:44.603
SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP.
WE BOTH WERE.

26:44.603 --> 26:46.909
LOOK, ROSS,
IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

26:46.909 --> 26:48.215
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

26:48.215 --> 26:50.217
YOU DON'T WANT
TO GO OUT WITH ME, FINE.

BUT, GOD, FOR YOU
TO REJECT MY HELP

26:53.307 --> 26:54.613
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

26:54.613 --> 26:56.223
EVERYTHING, VICTOR.

26:56.223 --> 26:57.920
THIS WHOLE IDEA
THAT YOU HAVE

26:57.920 --> 26:59.748
THAT LOVE
JUST MAGICALLY HAPPENS,

26:59.748 --> 27:01.837
THAT THERE'S NO POINT
IN WORKING

27:01.837 --> 27:02.838
TO HELP IT ALONG--

27:02.838 --> 27:03.970
WHY ARE YOU--

27:03.970 --> 27:05.188
BECAUSE
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

IF I'D JUST SAT AROUND
WAITING FOR LOVE TO HAPPEN,

I WOULDN'T HAVE
A DAUGHTER RIGHT NOW.

27:08.409 --> 27:10.150

27:10.150 --> 27:13.327
I WENT TO DOZENS
OF AGENCIES.

27:13.327 --> 27:15.155
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT IT WAS IN THE END?

27:15.155 --> 27:17.374
IT WAS A MATCH
MADE BY LAWYERS.

27:18.288 --> 27:20.334
AND GUESS WHAT.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.205
THERE'S NO ONE ON EARTH

27:22.205 --> 27:24.512
THAT I LOVE MORE.

27:28.516 --> 27:29.996
I'M SORRY
I MADE US SO LATE.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.345
I HAD TO KEEP TRYING
TO GET HIM, YOU KNOW?

27:31.345 --> 27:33.826
DON'T WORRY.

MUCH LATER.

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO--

27:46.621 --> 27:48.014
TURNED OUT
THEY DIDN'T NEED ME
THE WHOLE WEEK,

27:48.014 --> 27:49.189
SO I WANTED
TO COME UP.
I MISSED YOU.

27:49.189 --> 27:50.190
KIRSTEN.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.191
GOD, IT'S YOU.

27:51.191 --> 27:53.193
HEY, COME SIT DOWN
WITH ME.

27:53.193 --> 27:55.674
I GOT SOME STUFF
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

27:55.674 --> 27:56.631
OK. COME ON.

27:56.631 --> 27:57.937
HI, SWEETIE,
HOW YOU DOIN'?

27:59.939 --> 28:03.072
HE'S TELLING HER THAT
HE'S GONNA FIND, UM,

28:03.072 --> 28:07.120
A PLACE IN DALLAS
SO HE CAN COMMUTE
EVERY DAY.

28:07.120 --> 28:08.121
HE IS?

28:08.121 --> 28:09.644
YEAH. HE'S ALSO
GONNA ASK FOR

28:09.644 --> 28:11.254
A PERMANENT POST
ON THE BASE

28:11.254 --> 28:13.256
SO HE DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE DEPLOYED
SO MUCH.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.910
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ALL THAT?

28:14.910 --> 28:16.912
WELL, I...

28:16.912 --> 28:18.522
KIND OF HELPED.

28:18.522 --> 28:19.523
WHAT?

28:19.523 --> 28:20.960
HOW?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.613
WH--

28:24.572 --> 28:25.921
YOU CALLED HIM?

28:25.921 --> 28:27.793
YOU TOLD HIM
TO COME HERE

28:27.793 --> 28:29.272
AND TO MAKE
ALL THOSE PROMISES?

28:29.272 --> 28:32.101
WELL, THEY'RE NOT
JUST PROMISES,
KIRSTEN.

28:35.104 --> 28:36.802
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

28:36.802 --> 28:39.413
I MEAN,
GIVE THEM SOME TIME.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.371
NO. I...

28:41.371 --> 28:43.112
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THEM, CHARLIE.

28:43.112 --> 28:45.071
I'M TALKING ABOUT US.

28:45.071 --> 28:47.943
WHAT?

28:47.943 --> 28:51.642
CHARLIE, YOU MADE
THOSE SAME PROMISES.

28:51.642 --> 28:54.254
YOU SAID THAT THINGS
WOULD START GETTING EASIER.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.560
BUT THEY KEEP
GETTING WORSE.

28:56.560 --> 28:59.825
FIRST YOU--
YOU TAKE THE JOB
RUNNING THE FACTORY,

28:59.825 --> 29:01.783
THEN YOU GET
THAT BIG HUGE ORDER,

29:01.783 --> 29:03.306
AND THEN YOU BOUGHT
THE BUSINESS FROM GUS.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.613
I MEAN, WHEN DOES IT
START GETTING EASIER?

29:05.613 --> 29:07.136
OK, LISTEN. LISTEN.

29:07.136 --> 29:10.183
NO. I KNOW
THAT I SIGNED UP
FOR ALL OF THAT.

29:10.183 --> 29:13.926
AND I'M NOT SAYING
THAT YOU'RE LYING.
I'M JUST...

29:13.926 --> 29:15.579
I'M ABOUT TO HAVE
A BABY REALLY SOON,

29:15.579 --> 29:17.494
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE IT
ALL BY MYSELF.

29:17.494 --> 29:18.974
THAT IS NOT
GONNA HAPPEN.

29:18.974 --> 29:21.020
YOU KNOW I WON'T
LET THAT HAPPEN.

29:21.020 --> 29:25.676
I KNOW THAT YOU DON'T
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.375
BUT SOONER OR LATER,
I HAVE TO WONDER

29:28.375 --> 29:29.680
HOW MUCH THAT MEANS.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.030
KIRSTEN...

29:31.030 --> 29:32.640
NO.

29:32.640 --> 29:33.772
NO.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.166
IF YOU WANT
TO DO SOMETHING,

29:37.166 --> 29:39.603
DON'T TELL ME
ABOUT IT, JUST...

29:39.603 --> 29:43.085
BECAUSE I JUST...

29:43.085 --> 29:44.391
I CAN'T...

29:44.391 --> 29:47.394
HEAR ANY MORE WORDS.

29:56.055 --> 29:57.839
SO WHAT'D HE SAY?

29:57.839 --> 30:00.494
HAVE A LOT
OF EXCUSES?

30:00.494 --> 30:02.278
GRIFFIN...

30:02.278 --> 30:04.411
DID HIS OLD MAN
BEAT HIM UP?

30:04.411 --> 30:06.108
IS THAT HIS ROUTINE?

30:09.198 --> 30:12.071
HE WANTED TO SAY
HE WAS SORRY.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.681
YEAH, RIGHT.

30:13.681 --> 30:16.553
JULIA...WHY?

30:16.553 --> 30:18.555
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BE
NICE TO THE GUY?

30:18.555 --> 30:20.296
I WASN'T NICE TO HIM.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.645
YOU FORGAVE HIM,
THOUGH, DIDN'T YOU?

30:21.645 --> 30:23.822
NO, I DIDN'T FORGIVE HIM.
I WAS STRAIGHT WITH HIM.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.389
I TOLD HIM I WANTED HIM
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

30:26.389 --> 30:27.564
GOOD.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.221
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,
GRIFFIN?

30:32.221 --> 30:35.224
I DO WANT TO FORGIVE HIM.
I HOPE I CAN.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.269
WHY?

30:36.269 --> 30:37.531
I DON'T KNOW.

30:37.531 --> 30:40.360
BECAUSE MAYBE
I WANT TO FORGIVE MYSELF.

30:40.360 --> 30:44.016
BECAUSE MAYBE
I'D BE ABLE
TO LOOK BACK AND SAY...

30:44.016 --> 30:46.322
I WASN'T ALL WRONG.

30:46.322 --> 30:49.804
'CAUSE I DID ACTUALLY
LOVE HIM, GRIFFIN.

30:49.804 --> 30:51.719
[SIGHS]

30:52.894 --> 30:54.243
WHAT?

30:54.243 --> 30:56.071
IT'S JUST...

30:56.071 --> 30:58.204
A BUNCH OF CRAP.

30:58.204 --> 31:01.033
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT
BOTH WAYS, JULIA.

31:01.033 --> 31:03.687
IF YOU FORGIVE HIM,
THAT'S LIKE SAYING

31:03.687 --> 31:05.124
THAT WHAT HE DID
TO YOU WAS OK.

31:05.124 --> 31:08.127
THAT LIKE IF HE SAYS
HE'S SORRY AND--AND--

31:08.127 --> 31:10.956
AND EVENTUALLY
HE ACTS LIKE HE MEANS IT

31:10.956 --> 31:12.479
THAT IT'S OK.

31:12.479 --> 31:13.784
GRIFFIN, THAT'S NOT--

31:13.784 --> 31:15.612
LOOK, YOU...

31:15.612 --> 31:17.136
YOU WANTED MY OPINION.

31:17.136 --> 31:20.617
YOU MIGHT NOT
AGREE WITH IT,
BUT THAT'S IT.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.755
[FOOTSTEPS]

31:33.717 --> 31:35.589
HEY, YOU.

31:35.589 --> 31:36.938
HI.

31:36.938 --> 31:37.896
2 SECONDS, OK?

31:37.896 --> 31:40.115
I'M JUST
FINISHING UP HERE.

31:45.164 --> 31:47.949
YOU'RE A VERY STRANGE
PERSON.

31:47.949 --> 31:49.559
YOU KNOW THAT.

31:49.559 --> 31:51.083
[LAUGHS]

31:51.083 --> 31:53.433
IS "STRANGE"
ONE OF THOSE WORDS

31:53.433 --> 31:55.783
THAT'S ACTUALLY
A COMPLIMENT IN ENGLAND?

31:55.783 --> 31:57.785
NO. JUST, REALLY...

31:57.785 --> 32:00.527
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
LIKE YOU.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.703
NO ONE I'VE EVER MET.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.838
AND HERE I AM
ON THE VERGE
OF BEING DEPORTED,

32:07.838 --> 32:10.841
AND NOT ONLY
DO YOU COME UP WITH
A SOLUTION, BUT...

32:10.841 --> 32:13.975
YOU'VE MANAGED
TO MAKE IT FANTASTIC.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.977
AND I LOVE YOU FOR THAT.

32:15.977 --> 32:16.935
HOLLY...

32:16.935 --> 32:18.849
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT I SAID?

32:20.242 --> 32:22.549
I SAID I LOVE YOU.

32:23.811 --> 32:25.856
YEAH, I HEARD.

32:25.856 --> 32:28.207
AND I NEED YOU...

32:28.207 --> 32:32.124
TO UNDERSTAND THAT,
BECAUSE I...

32:32.124 --> 32:36.650
I NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THAT THAT'S...

32:36.650 --> 32:39.044
WHY I CAN'T MARRY YOU,

32:39.044 --> 32:40.654
BAILEY.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.310
HOLLY...

32:44.310 --> 32:45.441
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

32:45.441 --> 32:47.574
IS THIS BECAUSE OF
ALL THE...

32:47.574 --> 32:49.924
THE HONEYMOON STUFF?
DID I FREAK YOU OUT
WITH THAT?

32:49.924 --> 32:50.925
NO.

32:50.925 --> 32:51.926
IT'S NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

32:51.926 --> 32:52.971
IT'S, UH...

32:52.971 --> 32:55.799
IT'S ME, UH...

32:55.799 --> 32:57.758
I WAS WALKING BACK
FROM SCHOOL TODAY,

32:57.758 --> 33:00.674
AND I PASSED
THIS DEPARTMENT STORE,
AND I THOUGHT,

33:00.674 --> 33:02.197
I NEED SOME CLOTHES...

33:02.197 --> 33:03.677
TO GET MARRIED IN.

33:03.677 --> 33:05.679
SO, I WENT IN,
AND...

33:05.679 --> 33:07.159
I FOUND THIS
INCREDIBLE DRESS,

33:07.159 --> 33:08.682
AND IT WAS
KIND OF EXPENSIVE,

33:08.682 --> 33:09.857
AND I THOUGHT,
WHAT THE HECK,

33:09.857 --> 33:11.076
IT'S MY WEDDING DAY,
RIGHT?

33:11.076 --> 33:14.688
AND THEN I HAD TO
STOP MYSELF AND GO...

33:14.688 --> 33:16.037
WAIT.

33:16.037 --> 33:17.691
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

33:17.691 --> 33:19.693
BECAUSE...ALL OF THIS,
BAILEY,

33:19.693 --> 33:21.695
ALL OF THIS
IS JUST PRETEND.

33:21.695 --> 33:24.002
AND WHAT IF I WAS
LEADING YOU ON?

33:24.002 --> 33:25.699
HOLLY, WAIT A MINUTE--

33:25.699 --> 33:27.179
NO, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO BE SECOND-GUESSING

33:27.179 --> 33:28.702
EVERY DECISION
THAT I MAKE ABOUT US.

33:28.702 --> 33:30.182
I DON'T WANT
TO BE THINKING

33:30.182 --> 33:31.705
THAT WHEN
YOU'RE SLEEPING OVER,

33:31.705 --> 33:33.576
ARE WE ACTING LIKE
WE'RE TOO MARRIED?

33:33.576 --> 33:35.013
ARE WE MOVING TOO FAST?

33:35.013 --> 33:37.058
OK, SO THEN
WE WON'T DO THAT.

33:37.058 --> 33:38.799
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

33:38.799 --> 33:41.497
WHAT IF YOU FIND
A DREAM JOB IN ALASKA?

33:41.497 --> 33:44.631
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK THAT WE CAN'T
TAKE A BREAK

33:44.631 --> 33:48.504
BECAUSE...
WE MIGHT BE JEOPARDIZING
MY GREEN CARD.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.509
OK, LOOK. I KNOW
THAT THIS ISN'T EASY.

33:53.509 --> 33:54.815
NO.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.341
I CAN'T.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.128
AND I WON'T...

34:04.564 --> 34:06.914
DO THIS TO US.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.268
I WON'T.

34:19.100 --> 34:21.102
HEY, WERE YOU GONNA
DRIVE ME TO SCHOOL?

34:21.102 --> 34:22.973
YEAH, JUST A SEC.
CAN YOU WAIT?

34:22.973 --> 34:25.019
UH-HUH.

34:25.019 --> 34:26.194
WHAT'S THIS?

34:26.194 --> 34:28.849
IT'S, UH...

34:28.849 --> 34:31.373
IT'S A SITE
FOR ABUSE VICTIMS.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.984
HMM. WHY ARE YOU--

34:33.984 --> 34:35.986
WELL, THEY, UH,
THEY ASKED FOR

34:35.986 --> 34:37.727
LETTERS AND STORIES
AND STUFF

34:37.727 --> 34:39.599
SO PEOPLE CAN SHARE
THEIR EXPERIENCES.

34:39.599 --> 34:40.730
JULIE,
IS THAT YOUR BOOK?

34:40.730 --> 34:42.906
YUP.

34:42.906 --> 34:43.994
TRYING TO UPLOAD IT,

34:43.994 --> 34:45.909
BUT I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
HOW TO TAG THE FILE.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.172
THE WHOLE THING?

34:47.172 --> 34:48.999
SURE. WHY NOT?

34:48.999 --> 34:51.350
I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--

34:51.350 --> 34:53.134
THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
DONE WITH IT.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.658
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
IT HAD SOME PROBLEMS.

34:55.658 --> 34:57.138
YUP, IT DOES.

34:57.138 --> 34:59.445
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I READ IT AGAIN LAST NIGHT,

34:59.445 --> 35:02.187
AND I ADDED AN AFTERWORD
ABOUT SEEING NED

35:02.187 --> 35:05.059
AFTER ALL THIS TIME,
AND...

35:05.059 --> 35:06.365
IT'S GOOD ENOUGH.

35:06.365 --> 35:09.194
SINCE WHEN
IS GOOD ENOUGH
GOOD ENOUGH?

35:09.194 --> 35:10.543
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

35:10.543 --> 35:15.287
I MEAN, GRIFFIN WOULD SAY
I'M TOO FORGIVING OF NED,

35:15.287 --> 35:18.028
AND NED WOULD SAY
IT'S NOT FORGIVING ENOUGH,

35:18.028 --> 35:19.334
ANY EDITOR WOULD SAY

35:19.334 --> 35:20.640
IT'S NOT READY TO PUT
OUT THERE YET,

35:20.640 --> 35:21.945
AND ADAM WOULD SAY

35:21.945 --> 35:23.251
I SHOULDN'T CARE
ABOUT ANY OF THEM.

35:23.251 --> 35:24.209
AND THE TRUTH IS

35:24.209 --> 35:26.820
THEY'RE ALL PARTLY RIGHT.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.996
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
BOTTOM LINE IS
IF I THINK IT'S READY,

35:28.996 --> 35:30.519
THEN IT'S READY.

35:30.519 --> 35:31.694
RIGHT?

35:35.089 --> 35:37.091
OK.

35:37.091 --> 35:40.312
JUST CLICK ON
THAT BUTTON THERE
THAT SAYS BROWSE.

35:40.312 --> 35:42.575
AND YOU'LL FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

35:42.575 --> 35:44.707
THANK YOU.

35:44.707 --> 35:45.882
YOU'RE WELCOME.

35:45.882 --> 35:47.014
THERE IT IS.

35:49.059 --> 35:50.713
OK.

35:58.068 --> 35:59.113
VICTOR.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.070
CLAUDIA.

36:00.070 --> 36:01.071
HI.
HEY.

36:01.071 --> 36:02.116
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

36:02.116 --> 36:03.248
I'VE GOT A SESSION
AROUND THE CORNER

36:03.248 --> 36:04.423
IN A FEW MINUTES.

36:04.423 --> 36:05.380
HOW ABOUT YOU?

36:05.380 --> 36:08.296
JUST HAVING COFFEE.
THAT'S ALL.

36:08.296 --> 36:09.645
I'M JUST GONNA
SET THIS DOWN.

36:09.645 --> 36:10.820
OK.

36:12.866 --> 36:15.608
LISTEN, I MEAN,
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE ROSS THING.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.827
YOU WERE RIGHT. IT WAS
NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.613
OK, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S FINE. REALLY.

36:20.613 --> 36:22.658
YOU WERE JUST
TRYING TO HELP.

36:22.658 --> 36:23.877
OH, WAIT.

36:23.877 --> 36:26.227
DO NOT TURN AROUND.

36:26.227 --> 36:27.402
IT'S ROSS.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.664
REALLY?

36:28.664 --> 36:30.318
YEAH, UH HUH.

36:30.318 --> 36:33.974
I'LL JUST, UH, DISTRACT
HIM AND YOU CAN
HEAD OUT.

36:33.974 --> 36:35.367
OH, WAIT, ARE YOU
HERE WITH SOMEONE?

36:35.367 --> 36:36.672
ME? WHY?

36:36.672 --> 36:40.110
WELL, YOU'VE GOT
TWO CUPS OF--

36:40.110 --> 36:41.111
VICTOR.

36:41.111 --> 36:42.678
HMM?

36:42.678 --> 36:44.419
YOU'RE HERE WITH ROSS.

36:44.419 --> 36:45.942
WHAT?

36:45.942 --> 36:46.943
YOU ARE.

36:46.943 --> 36:49.337
YOU'RE ON A DATE
WITH ROSS.

36:49.337 --> 36:51.644
NO. THIS IS COFFEE.

36:51.644 --> 36:52.732
I KNEW IT.

36:52.732 --> 36:54.647
SEE, I KNEW IT. I WAS
RIGHT AND HERE YOU ARE

36:54.647 --> 36:56.388
SAYING IT JUST
HAS TO HAPPEN.

36:56.388 --> 36:58.433
NOTHING IS HAPPENING.

36:58.433 --> 37:00.783
NOT YET.

37:00.783 --> 37:02.524
AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU
DON'T GET OUT OF HERE.

37:02.524 --> 37:05.005
IF HE SEES YOU,
HE'S GONNA ASK YOU
TO JOIN US, SO...

37:05.005 --> 37:06.180
SCOOT!

37:18.148 --> 37:19.846
HEY.
HEY.

37:19.846 --> 37:21.413
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
TO WORK LATE?

37:21.413 --> 37:22.936
I DID.

37:22.936 --> 37:25.547
BUT, UH...

37:25.547 --> 37:26.635
THEN I REALIZED
THAT I HAD

37:26.635 --> 37:28.768
SOMETHING THAT I HAD
TO DO MORE.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.292
OH. WHAT?

37:31.292 --> 37:32.902
I HAD TO COME HOME

37:32.902 --> 37:35.253
AND CELEBRATE OUR
ANNIVERSARY.

37:37.211 --> 37:39.561
CHARLIE, OUR ANNIVERSARY
WAS DAYS AGO.

37:39.561 --> 37:42.651
OR MONTHS FROM NOW IF
YOU MEAN THE REAL ONE.

37:42.651 --> 37:45.045
I KNOW.

37:45.045 --> 37:49.484
BUT, THIS IS
A DIFFERENT ANNIVERSARY.

37:49.484 --> 37:51.399
IT IS?

37:51.399 --> 37:52.879
THIS IS THE ANNIVERSARY
OF THE DAY

37:52.879 --> 37:55.447
THAT I CAME HOME FROM
WORK EARLY TO TELL YOU

37:55.447 --> 37:58.014
THAT FROM NOW ON,
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE

37:58.014 --> 37:59.494
THAT I'M HOME TO YOU
NO LATER

37:59.494 --> 38:01.279
THAN 7:00 IN THE EVENING.

38:01.279 --> 38:02.367
WHAT?

38:02.367 --> 38:04.456
3 NIGHTS A WEEK,
MINIMUM.

38:04.456 --> 38:07.285
WITH AN OPTION
FOR A FOURTH.

38:07.285 --> 38:11.245
CHARLIE, I KNOW
YOU MEAN WELL.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.378
BUT I DON'T WANT YOU
TO MAKE ANY PROMISES

38:13.378 --> 38:15.075
THAT YOU CAN'T KEEP.

38:15.075 --> 38:17.643
SEE?

38:17.643 --> 38:21.299
I'M UNPLUGGING
THE PHONE.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.562
AND...

38:23.562 --> 38:25.477
I'M TURNING OFF
MY CELL PHONE.

38:25.477 --> 38:28.088
AND ALSO MY PAGER.

38:28.088 --> 38:29.872
AND PLEASE NOTICE

38:29.872 --> 38:32.135
3 UNANSWERED CALLS ALREADY.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.268
I WAS TOO BUSY CALLING OUT
FOR TAKE-OUT IN THE CAR--

38:34.268 --> 38:38.707
WHICH SHOULD BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

38:38.707 --> 38:41.623
AND...

38:41.623 --> 38:46.062
[MUSIC PLAYING]

38:53.243 --> 38:56.072
WOW.

38:56.072 --> 38:58.466
THREE NIGHTS A WEEK?

38:58.466 --> 39:01.034
AND THAT'S
JUST MY OPENING OFFER.

39:01.034 --> 39:03.906
YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNTER.

39:03.906 --> 39:07.780
I THINK...

39:07.780 --> 39:10.870
I'D JUST LIKE TO DANCE.

39:37.723 --> 39:40.116
HEY.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.422
HI.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.946
CAN I TALK TO YOU GUYS
FOR A SEC?

39:43.946 --> 39:46.819
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:48.777 --> 39:50.605
I LIE IN BED
IN THAT LAUNDRY ROOM,

39:50.605 --> 39:52.564
I LOOK UP AT THOSE PIPES,

39:52.564 --> 39:53.739
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I DREAM ABOUT?

39:53.739 --> 39:55.218
OTHER THAN
MY OWN APARTMENT?

39:55.218 --> 39:58.787
I DREAM OF HAVING
WHAT YOU GUYS HAVE.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.572
SOMEBODY
I CARE ABOUT SO MUCH

40:00.572 --> 40:03.749
I'D RISK GETTING ARRESTED
TO KEEP HER AROUND.

40:03.749 --> 40:05.403
OR FLY THOUSANDS
OF MILES

40:05.403 --> 40:08.449
TO PROTECT
THE RELATIONSHIP.

40:08.449 --> 40:09.450
WILL, WHAT ARE YOU--

40:09.450 --> 40:11.583
BAILEY, YOU'RE MY
BEST FRIEND.

40:11.583 --> 40:16.065
OK, AND YOU'VE
PROVEN THAT TO ME
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.850
I MEAN, LAST YEAR
WITH HANNAH,

40:17.850 --> 40:20.896
AND THIS YEAR WITH
LETTING ME MOVE IN
WITH YOU.

40:20.896 --> 40:22.071
THE POINT IS,

40:22.071 --> 40:25.727
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK.

40:25.727 --> 40:26.859
WHAT'S GOING ON?

40:38.958 --> 40:41.656
WILL YOU MARRY ME,
HOLLY?

40:41.656 --> 40:44.180
I THINK YOU SHOULD--
YOU SHOULD MARRY ME.

40:44.180 --> 40:46.052
HOLLY.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.227
TOO DRAMATIC. SORRY.

40:47.227 --> 40:49.403
THAT'S--IT'S JUST--

40:49.403 --> 40:50.622
GOD, I HOPE THIS IS EASIER

40:50.622 --> 40:51.623
WHEN I HAVE TO DO IT
FOR REAL.

40:51.623 --> 40:52.928
WILL, YOU GOT
TO BE KIDDING?!

40:52.928 --> 40:56.976
NO, I'M NOT. I--I'VE GIVEN
THIS ALL KINDS OF THOUGHT.

40:56.976 --> 40:58.847
AND...

40:58.847 --> 41:01.502
I WANT TO DO THIS
FOR YOU.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.113
I--NO, WILL.
I--I--

41:04.113 --> 41:06.202
I CAN'T LET YOU
DO THIS.

41:06.202 --> 41:08.204
YES, YOU CAN.

41:10.119 --> 41:11.599
YOU ARE THE BEST THING
THAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM

41:11.599 --> 41:13.688
IN A REALLY LONG TIME.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.647
YOU GUYS CAN'T
TALK ME OUT OF IT.

41:15.647 --> 41:19.215
I HAVE RIGHT
ON MY SIDE, SO...

41:19.215 --> 41:21.479
SAY YES.

41:27.876 --> 41:29.399
YES!

41:29.399 --> 41:30.923
THAT MEANS YOU
COULD STAY.

41:30.923 --> 41:34.448
OH, MY GOD!

41:34.448 --> 41:37.669
WELL, GOOD.
THIS IS--THIS IS GREAT.

41:37.669 --> 41:38.757
I'M, UH, I'M SO GLAD.

41:38.757 --> 41:42.108
OH, WILL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH!

41:42.108 --> 41:43.370
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.893
WOW.

42:04.173 --> 42:06.872
Woman: WHAT A SHOCK
WHEN I LOOKED FOR POSTS TODAY
AND SAW YOUR BOOK.

42:06.872 --> 42:16.882
I THOUGHT, "WOW, THAT'S GUTSY,
POSTING A 250-PAGE BOOK."

42:16.882 --> 42:20.973
THEN I STARTED READING.

42:20.973 --> 42:22.975
Second woman:
YOU PUT STUFF IN WORDS

42:22.975 --> 42:24.977
THAT I NEVER KNEW
HOW TO SAY.

42:24.977 --> 42:28.328
IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE
WAS TELLING MY STORY
TO ME.

42:28.328 --> 42:30.330
Woman: I HAVE ALL KINDS OF
FRIENDS WHO TRY TO HELP,

42:30.330 --> 42:31.679
THANK YOU, JULIA.

42:31.679 --> 42:34.203
BUT THERE'S NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY KNOW.

42:34.203 --> 42:37.555
Woman: THEY ALL THINK
SEEING HIM LIKE
SOME KIND OF MONSTER

42:37.555 --> 42:39.121
IS SOME KIND OF ANSWER.

42:39.121 --> 42:43.648
THE ANSWER IS, GO GET HELP.

42:43.648 --> 42:46.476
Woman: BUT MOST OF ALL,
THANKS FOR REMINDING ME...

42:46.476 --> 42:47.695
I'M NOT ALONE.

42:47.695 --> 42:50.132
THESE THINGS
HAPPEN TO PEOPLE.

42:52.570 --> 42:53.832
Second woman:
AND AFTERWARDS,

42:53.832 --> 42:55.137
EVEN IF I HAVE TO
START FROM SCRATCH,

42:55.137 --> 43:00.229
AND THERE'S
NO ONE AROUND,
I'LL BE FINE.

43:00.229 --> 43:01.404
BECAUSE I'M NEVER ALONE

43:01.404 --> 43:04.190
ONCE I'VE LEARNED
HOW TO COUNT ON MYSELF.
