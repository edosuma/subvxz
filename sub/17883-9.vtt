00:08.776 --> 00:11.243
Yeah, make way
for the champ,

00:11.245 --> 00:12.978
Billy Bot Thornton.

00:12.980 --> 00:16.281
Mmm. Activate sling blade.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.085
What the hell
is that thing?

00:20.087 --> 00:22.554
Battle bot.
I'm in a club, a bot club.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.023
That's all I can tell you.
Why is that?

00:24.025 --> 00:27.059
First rule of bot club,
you don't talk about bot club.

00:27.061 --> 00:30.295
Second rule of bot club,
you can tell girls,

00:30.297 --> 00:31.930
'cause...
'Cause we need 'em.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.732
Taking new members?
I love robits.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.336
First of all, it's robots.
"Robits?" Who says that?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.571
Second,
you're an accountant.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.908
Later, civvy.

00:44.744 --> 00:45.711
Uh, here are those, um,

00:45.713 --> 00:47.513
T.P.S. report things
that you wanted.

00:47.515 --> 00:50.382
Yeah, uh, and, uh,
here's those invoices.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.017
Excellent. Thank you.
That's great.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.053
Cheers. Oh!
Oh!

00:54.055 --> 00:55.621
Sorry.

00:57.291 --> 00:59.024
Dude.

00:59.026 --> 01:02.061
People gave more eye contact
to Travolta

01:02.063 --> 01:03.529
after  <i>Battlefield Earth.</i>

01:03.531 --> 01:04.163
What is the deal?

01:04.165 --> 01:09.401
Yeah. This morning we had
a very unfortunate roommate mishap.

01:17.878 --> 01:18.977
What are you doing
in my shower?

01:18.979 --> 01:21.680
Your shower? I'm the one
who put the water on!

01:22.082 --> 01:23.148
Stop looking at it!

01:23.150 --> 01:24.783
It's looking at me.

01:24.785 --> 01:25.951
So let me get this straight.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.886
You got all naked,
wet, and soapy

01:27.888 --> 01:30.489
with the girl of my dreams
this morning?

01:30.723 --> 01:31.256
Technically.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.460
I don't know whether to ask you
for the dirty details

01:34.462 --> 01:37.129
or just Texas Chainsaw
your ass.

01:38.966 --> 01:42.067
- I can't believe you.
-  Naked?

01:58.017 --> 02:00.552
<i>♪ We got your back</i>

02:01.554 --> 02:03.155
Great news,
my little ponies!

02:03.157 --> 02:05.457
I just scored us
a $600 bottle of scotch

02:05.459 --> 02:07.326
and sticks
fresh off the boat.

02:07.328 --> 02:09.328
Tonight's guys' night.
Epic.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.763
Drinks and smokes?
Count me in.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.465
Just let me power down
my Activia,

02:13.467 --> 02:16.468
get the old colon fired up,
and then I am good to go.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.338
Great. Well, we're just going through
some inventory tonight.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.541
We got a new shipment
of U.V. remotes, ionizers,

02:22.543 --> 02:24.810
and motion sensor
trigger plates.

02:24.812 --> 02:27.112
I'm out. No more bets.

02:27.114 --> 02:29.748
I thought guys' night was ruined.
How'd you do that?

02:29.750 --> 02:31.650
Yeah, I got a new system
for getting rid of Vee.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.885
You just mention
three technical terms

02:32.887 --> 02:35.754
she doesn't understand,
and poof! She skedaddles.

02:35.756 --> 02:37.389
All right.
I'm off to lunch.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.691
Yummy yum-yums!
Daddy, can I go?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.560
Yes, yes,
we can finally discuss

02:41.562 --> 02:43.962
the infrared scopes,
the tectonic plates,

02:43.964 --> 02:45.664
and the chupacabra.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.432
Good luck.

02:48.067 --> 02:49.668
All right, boys,
I'll see you at 1800 hours,

02:49.670 --> 02:51.970
and I'm bringing a very,
very special guest

02:51.972 --> 02:53.238
that's going to blow
your mind.

02:53.240 --> 02:56.475
I'll give you a little hint.
He's made of steel.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.844
Hey, Oz, do you think
you could keep

02:58.846 --> 03:00.078
the cup for us
for a couple days?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.713
Yeah, we gotta run down
to Mexico

03:01.715 --> 03:02.948
to bail our brother out
of jail.

03:02.950 --> 03:03.982
He punched a federale.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.251
How'd you boys get the cup
in the first place?

03:06.253 --> 03:07.286
Well, we punched a guy.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.656
You Hanson Brothers, you really like to
punch guys, don't ya?

03:10.658 --> 03:11.557
It's what we do.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.993
For the next 24 hours, we are going to
guard this cup

03:14.995 --> 03:15.727
with vigilance and respect.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.431
Excuse me for not being excited about
an oversized ice bucket.

03:19.433 --> 03:22.935
Unless it has superpowers
or transforms into a robot,

03:22.937 --> 03:23.702
Cash won't appreciate it.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.237
Yeah. You know,
what I don't appreciate

03:25.239 --> 03:28.040
is being put on blast
by a bean counter.

03:28.042 --> 03:28.907
I'm a C.P.A.
C.P.A.?

03:28.909 --> 03:31.543
What does that stand for,
certified public anus?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.412
Please!
Stop ruining guys' night.

03:33.414 --> 03:37.416
Guys' night?
I love guys' night!

03:37.418 --> 03:39.952
What are you talking about,
brohams, huh?

03:39.954 --> 03:41.887
I got this. We're discussing
fiber optics,

03:41.889 --> 03:44.723
onomatopoeia,
the industrial revolution.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.459
Oh, my God.
I love all those things!

03:47.461 --> 03:50.495
Well, that trick's dead.
All right, boys.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.731
Give us the roof.
What?

03:52.733 --> 03:54.499
You heard me.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.768
Uh, but for her? Man.

03:57.937 --> 03:58.770
The guys need this.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.807
We spend all week doing
damage control

04:01.809 --> 04:02.608
for your screw-ups.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.877
My screw-ups?
Name one.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.948
Vee, have you seen the schematics for
the new casino job?

04:11.851 --> 04:13.018
Um...

04:13.020 --> 04:14.586
I'm gonna need some tape.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.821
Tried to back up the van,

04:15.823 --> 04:18.190
but it went
in the wrong direction.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.558
I'll move it!

04:19.560 --> 04:20.359
Do not move the van!

04:20.361 --> 04:22.227
It's like
the movie  <i>Signs!</i>

04:22.229 --> 04:24.696
You back up
and my guts spill out!

04:24.698 --> 04:25.430
Well, guess what?

04:25.432 --> 04:28.634
Tomorrow the girls
are having a girls' night.

04:28.636 --> 04:29.468
Sounds like a great plan.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.870
It is a great plan.
You're not invited.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.138
Girls' night?

04:33.140 --> 04:34.706
This is bad for you,
dude.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.074
If Molly knows
what you're packing,

04:36.076 --> 04:37.943
that means the rest
of the women will, too.

04:37.945 --> 04:38.543
How do you know?

04:38.545 --> 04:40.479
My mom's book club.
They spend five minutes

04:40.481 --> 04:42.681
reading  <i>Anna Karenina,</i>
<i>and the rest of the time</i>

04:42.683 --> 04:44.783
they're talking
about you-know-what.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.685
Girth, width,
length, heft.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.719
Oh, they're ruthless.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.721
Like I care about
what a bunch of drunk girls

04:49.723 --> 04:52.524
have to say about me
or my body.

04:52.859 --> 04:54.293
Oh, God.
Please don't say anything.

Oh! Oh!

05:01.168 --> 05:05.103
Oh! Oh, sorry. I thought I ordered
an iced tea.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.473
Dude.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.841
This is seriously
messed up, man.

05:09.843 --> 05:12.277
Look, I know this is
a total invasion of privacy

05:12.279 --> 05:13.445
and a misuse
of company equipment.

05:13.447 --> 05:17.149
Oh, I don't give a flying frack!
I'm gonna frackin' die!

05:17.850 --> 05:21.119
Can I jump in? I just have one
copy to make. Kinda slammed today.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.121
Slammed doing what,
adding up pay stubs?

05:23.123 --> 05:24.456
Your job can be done
with a stick

05:24.458 --> 05:25.424
and couple of beads.

05:25.426 --> 05:29.294
Really? You want to bring up
the abacus? Not cool, man.

05:29.296 --> 05:32.764
You know what's
not cool? You!

05:32.865 --> 05:36.068
That's it. You just got

Tomorrow. 3:00. Parking lot.
You're going down.

05:49.549 --> 05:50.849
You, of all people,
should know

05:50.851 --> 05:52.184
what it feels like
to be bullied.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.553
I'm not a bully.
I just relentlessly taunt him

05:54.555 --> 05:57.689
because he's a math dork
and he isn't cool like me.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.825
He likes it.
It's our thing.

do that?

06:37.765 --> 06:41.032

No worries. She's just having it
polished up for you.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.281
<i>You're gonna kill me,</i>
<i>right?</i>

09:09.283 --> 09:11.550
Yes. Yes, I am.

09:11.552 --> 09:14.452
Okay, good.
Appreciate your honesty.

09:14.454 --> 09:17.389
Well,
it's been fun.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.658
It'll be here
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.358
It better be.

09:20.360 --> 09:24.262
'Cause if it's not, we're gonna punch
everyone in the office.

09:24.964 --> 09:28.366
Except you.
We're kinda scared of you.

09:29.235 --> 09:30.602
So, it's come
to my attention that

09:30.604 --> 09:34.406
there were some very serious threats
made here yesterday.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.006
Buddy?

09:35.008 --> 09:35.941
Not that I recall.

09:35.943 --> 09:40.178
Please. You said, at 3:00,
you were gonna whup my butt.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.146
You know what?
I happen to have

09:41.148 --> 09:44.749
a pamphlet on resolving conflict
in the workplace.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.752
I think that really
might help you guys.

09:48.187 --> 09:48.820
You see that?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.956
He just made the universal
throat-slitting sign.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.491
You're paranoid, son.
I was fixing my tie.

09:53.493 --> 09:54.993
Seriously,
I think he's on drugs.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.961
- Drugs?
- Yeah.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.196
Well, you know,
I have two pamphlets on that.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.432
All right.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.266
Oh! Look!

10:01.268 --> 10:02.400
Right there.
Right there.

10:02.402 --> 10:05.003
He just punched his fist
into his big, meaty hand!

10:05.005 --> 10:08.139
Are you crazy?
That was just a bug

10:08.141 --> 10:10.342
which I squished
and destroyed.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.510
Carol, how are you missing
the subtext of this?

10:12.512 --> 10:15.347
Clearly, I'm the bug
in the scenario.

10:15.349 --> 10:18.917
Are we done?
I've really got some work to do.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.286
Till 3:00.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.921
Tattletale.

10:33.799 --> 10:37.135
I can't believe
you lost the cup.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.870
Veronica, there are
certain things

10:38.872 --> 10:40.405
that are simply...

10:40.407 --> 10:41.673
...irreplaceable.

10:41.675 --> 10:42.507
Um, uh, I have a suggestion.

10:42.509 --> 10:44.943
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!
When Oz has the samurai sword,

10:44.945 --> 10:45.710
we don't speak-y.

10:45.712 --> 10:48.713
If word leaks out
that we lost that cup,

10:48.715 --> 10:51.116
it's going to ruin
this company's reputation.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.551
I hope your silly little
girls' night was worth it!

10:53.553 --> 10:55.687
You took it to your
dumb pickle party.

10:55.689 --> 10:58.390
Don't you think that's a tiny bit of
a double standard?

10:58.392 --> 11:00.258
I think it's a huge
double standard...

11:00.260 --> 11:04.262
Because we'd never lose it!

11:09.503 --> 11:12.737
Okay, guys, um,
I think I might be able

11:12.739 --> 11:15.573
to help figure out
what happened.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.108
Molly, will you give us
the room?

11:17.110 --> 11:17.942
What? No.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.744
Spit it out!
Okay, okay!

11:19.746 --> 11:22.380
Last night,
I kinda, sort of, spied

11:22.382 --> 11:25.383
on your girls' night
and, maybe,

11:25.385 --> 11:27.152
heard everything you said.

11:27.219 --> 11:28.720
Everything?

11:28.722 --> 11:30.822
The bright side,
if the cup went missing,

11:30.824 --> 11:33.925
it's all on tape,
as is the fact that you

11:33.927 --> 11:35.794
think I'm cute
and you'd kiss me.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.229
Wonderful.

11:38.231 --> 11:40.198
All right.
Let's go look at the tapes.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.301
No! Cam and I are going
to look at the tapes.

11:43.303 --> 11:46.004
How about Molly and I
look at the tapes

11:46.006 --> 11:47.005
and we go find the cup?

11:47.007 --> 11:48.940
No, you are going
to sit down

11:48.942 --> 11:53.812
at that split-in-half desk
and do nothing!

11:53.879 --> 11:55.046
Come on.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.183
Oh, this is guys' night
all over again.

11:58.185 --> 12:02.053
Well, guess what, Molly?
Today belongs to the women.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.288
Mmm.
Come on.

12:03.290 --> 12:06.558
Let's go find
that freaking cup.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.995
Okay, so here's the point
where the girls took off.

12:10.997 --> 12:13.164
That's when I started
packing it in.

12:17.103 --> 12:18.036
Bingo-bango. Busboy.

12:18.038 --> 12:20.438
Let's boogie!
Come on. Come on.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.039
No, Oz! Oz!

12:21.041 --> 12:22.607
Buddy's gonna
punch my face in.

12:22.609 --> 12:23.842
You can't allow it, man.
No allowing!

12:23.844 --> 12:27.345
It's a rite of passage.
Every great man has taken a punch.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.813
Even you?
I'm Oz.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.849
I've avoided my whole life
getting punched in the face,

12:30.851 --> 12:34.085
but Buddy Revell is too smart
for the possum act!

12:34.087 --> 12:36.721
What's wrong with him?
I didn't even hit the kid.

12:36.723 --> 12:38.256
I think he's dead.

12:38.258 --> 12:40.892
Holy crap, dude.
Let's get out of here.

12:40.894 --> 12:43.695
Don't you get it?
At 3:00, I'm gonna die!

12:43.697 --> 12:46.664
At 3:00,
you become a man!

12:46.899 --> 12:47.432
Ow.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.868
That was right
in my allergy shot.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.836
Every time.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.207
I can't do this!

12:56.209 --> 12:58.943
You can, and you will.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.714
What are you doing?

13:04.150 --> 13:06.351
Ticktock.

13:17.263 --> 13:20.198
Guys, I'd love to be
included in this, huh?

13:21.334 --> 13:23.201
Mmm. Hector, I know
you speak English.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.936
We're in the same
football pool together.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.137
What's going on, man?

13:32.845 --> 13:33.778
Mmm.

13:33.780 --> 13:34.746
Uh, you know what?
Fine. Fine.

13:34.748 --> 13:37.682
I'll just, uh, speak French
and make you guys feel

13:37.684 --> 13:40.185
<i>tres miserable,</i> huh?

13:44.657 --> 13:45.924
You heard the man.
Let's hit it.

13:45.926 --> 13:48.026
No, I didn't hear anything.
I know nothing.

13:48.028 --> 13:50.061
Hector,  <i>muy</i> uncool, dude.

13:50.063 --> 13:50.728
Hey, what's up, Cam?

13:50.730 --> 13:54.499
Hey, Raiders are looking good
this year, huh?

13:54.501 --> 13:55.300
Oh.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.501
Hector.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.669
We should
probably get going.

13:57.671 --> 13:58.536
Yeah. Come on.
Sorry.

13:58.538 --> 14:01.573
Okay. I just got off the horn with
the catering company.

14:01.575 --> 14:03.541
It seems the cup was rented
out for a bar mitzvah.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.777
Let's get there before
Vee screws up our only lead.

14:05.779 --> 14:07.779
Veronica and Molly already
have a head start.

14:07.781 --> 14:09.080
Well, that's where
you come in.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.748
You're gonna hack
into their nav system

14:10.750 --> 14:12.717
and send those girls
on a wild-goose chase.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.919
Go, go, go!

14:15.020 --> 14:19.190
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>your destination.</i>

14:21.628 --> 14:23.127
Y'all lookin' for a party?

14:23.129 --> 14:23.862
Uh, yes, thank you.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.464
The Barry Horowitz
bar mitzvah party?

14:26.466 --> 14:30.168
Oh, Molly. You're so naive.
Let me handle this.

14:30.170 --> 14:34.706
Would you ask your pimp
where Temple Beth Adonai is?

14:34.708 --> 14:36.307
I think you took
a wrong turn, ladies.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.644
Uh, yes, and I think perhaps
the men are behind this.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.311
They always are, girls.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.447
Oh, you know what? While we're here,
we might as well score some...

14:42.449 --> 14:45.049
No, actually, we're fine.
Thank you very much.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.784
Uh, thank you. Good-bye.

14:46.786 --> 14:49.520
Ricky! Look, I know it's gonna
sound kinda crazy,

14:49.522 --> 14:51.155
but I'm kinda fighting
Buddy today.

14:51.157 --> 14:52.457
Yeah. I already
bet 100 bucks.

14:52.459 --> 14:54.659
What? People are betting?
Oh, yeah.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.960
Most people think
it's gonna be a choke-out,

14:55.962 --> 14:58.396
but I'm positive it's gonna be
a straight beat-down.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.230
No, not if I can help it.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.498
I remember you mentioning
every day

15:00.500 --> 15:01.933
that you're a black belt
in karate.

15:01.935 --> 15:03.534
It's pronounced kay-rah-tay.

15:03.536 --> 15:05.303
Funny backstory...
Okay, look, shut up.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.273
I only have 45 minutes
to learn how to defend myself.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.441
Be my Miyagi.
Teach me.

15:10.443 --> 15:13.177
The lesson has
already begun.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.381
Aah!

15:18.018 --> 15:19.217
Aah! Aah!

15:20.053 --> 15:22.720
Aah! Bah! Bah! Bah!

15:22.722 --> 15:25.857
Oh! Wah-bah! Oh!

15:27.160 --> 15:28.826
Bah!

15:31.630 --> 15:33.564
So just do that.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.567
Really? I can't even
kick a soccer ball.

15:36.569 --> 15:39.804
I gotta go. I have ten minutes left.
Where are you going?

15:39.806 --> 15:40.838
I gotta bet more money.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.242
But, Ricky! Ricky!
Rick...

15:46.278 --> 15:47.645
Aah.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.653
Here's the plan.
We blend, find the cup,

15:55.655 --> 15:58.089
and then we bounce,
and watch out for...

15:58.091 --> 15:59.624
The fairer sex?

15:59.626 --> 16:00.224
Shalom, Oswald.

16:00.226 --> 16:04.963
You tried to waylay us,
but as usual, the womenfolk have prevailed.

16:04.965 --> 16:07.732
As a matter of fact, we've been made
honorary members

16:07.734 --> 16:08.633
of the East Side Maniacs.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.602
Okay, Psycho Vic,
if you'd just lean in a little bit there...

16:11.604 --> 16:13.004
You, too, Z-Murder.

16:13.006 --> 16:13.604
Come on. Get in.

16:13.606 --> 16:18.977
Okay, everyone, represent
in three, two, one...

16:19.846 --> 16:23.147
We told you that the women
would find the cup,

16:23.149 --> 16:24.615
and that's exactly
what's going to happen.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.217
They are coming at 9:00 a.m.
sharp for that cup,

16:26.219 --> 16:29.854
so let's just put a little cease-fire
on our gender war here.

16:29.856 --> 16:31.389
Uh, too late, I'm afraid.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.623
You men are
sneaky, devious,

16:32.625 --> 16:36.527
and you show your winkies in the shower
and then try to blame us for it.

16:36.529 --> 16:38.896
Hey, I've seen
all three of your things.

16:38.898 --> 16:40.598
You don't see me
complaining.

16:40.600 --> 16:41.632
Never you mind my things.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.669
As far as I'm concerned,
you win. We surrender.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.971
If it's that important
to you, we'll just...

16:46.973 --> 16:48.272
Go! Go, go, go!

16:48.274 --> 16:49.607
Oh!

17:13.366 --> 17:17.568
Okay.
Time to become a man.

17:20.673 --> 17:21.773
All right. Cam.
Yeah?

17:21.775 --> 17:24.642
Fan out.
It's a huge steel cup.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.577
It's one of a kind.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.314
Uh, not exactly.

17:30.316 --> 17:33.284
But...
Which one's the cup?

17:33.286 --> 17:35.453
You must choose wisely.

17:35.455 --> 17:38.556
Oh, hey, thanks for the tip,
elderly rabbi,

17:38.558 --> 17:40.691
but, uh,
I think this is a call

17:40.693 --> 17:44.429
for good, old-fashioned
women's intuition.

17:44.431 --> 17:45.930
Right?
Right.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.298
Yes!

17:47.300 --> 17:50.835
Oh, I got you now, baby.

17:50.837 --> 17:54.205
What?
She chose...

17:54.973 --> 17:56.541
Poorly.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.746
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:01.748 --> 18:07.185
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:07.187 --> 18:09.554
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:09.556 --> 18:12.857
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:12.859 --> 18:15.793
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:15.795 --> 18:19.130
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:20.866 --> 18:21.732
What are you doing, man?

18:21.734 --> 18:24.302
Uh, punching. You said you were gonna
whup my butt.

18:24.304 --> 18:28.239
Not "butt."
"Bot," as in "robot."

18:28.241 --> 18:31.342
See, this is why
we say "robits."

18:33.646 --> 18:36.514
You thought I was gonna
engage in fisticuffs?

18:37.015 --> 18:37.615
I'm a man of peace.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.484
Just take off
your shirts...

18:39.486 --> 18:41.652
And fight already.

18:42.087 --> 18:45.156
Okay, buddy revell.
Let's do this.

18:45.158 --> 18:46.591
Without the shirt thing,
though.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.927

19:22.394 --> 19:23.294
Aah!

19:23.296 --> 19:25.796
Oh! Whoa! Whoa!
I got it!

19:25.798 --> 19:27.565
I got it!

19:28.167 --> 19:28.666
Oh!

19:28.668 --> 19:31.002
So, uh, how do you know
the Bar Mitzvah boy?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.403
Uh...
Also, are you married?

19:32.405 --> 19:34.505
Oz, I need your help!
Aah!

19:34.507 --> 19:35.106
So do I!

19:35.108 --> 19:36.607
<i>♪ I'm-a beat that,</i>
<i>beat that down</i>

19:36.609 --> 19:39.076
<i>♪ I'm-a beat that,</i>
<i>beat that down ♪</i>

19:39.078 --> 19:39.877
Yeah!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.647
Oh!

19:45.784 --> 19:47.652
You can do better
than that!

19:47.654 --> 19:48.719
Whoo!

19:50.623 --> 19:51.522
Yes! Whoo!

19:53.092 --> 19:55.826
All right. You won.
Go ahead and gloat.

19:55.828 --> 19:56.394
No, that was epic.

19:56.396 --> 20:00.798
I've never seen a newbie last
that long against Billy Bot Thornton.

20:01.233 --> 20:03.000
So I can come to Bot Club?

20:03.268 --> 20:04.802
First rule?

20:11.944 --> 20:13.778
Well...

20:13.845 --> 20:15.780
That was
a little insane.

20:15.782 --> 20:17.548
Yeah.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.516
Look...

20:18.518 --> 20:20.685
I'm really sorry
about spying on you.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.721
I guess I was just,
you know, embarrassed.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.757
You've got nothing
to be embarrassed about...

20:26.759 --> 20:27.892
Or overly proud of.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.794
I get it.
I'm average.

20:29.796 --> 20:33.030
And don't read too much
into what I said.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.899
Yes, you're cute.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.401
But most of the time
I just want to kill you.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.503
And the feeling's mutual.

20:43.642 --> 20:44.242
All right.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.611
Here you go.
All cleaned up.

20:46.613 --> 20:51.048
This cup now has less chocolate
than the NHL.

20:51.216 --> 20:53.384
I guess it goes without saying,
but...

20:53.386 --> 20:55.987
I'm sorry.

20:56.121 --> 20:57.555
It's all okay.

20:57.557 --> 20:59.156
Why don't you
take a seat?

20:59.158 --> 21:02.593
Oh, all right,
but only for a second.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.862
I've decided to
give you the roof.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.530
Oh.
You know, Oswald,

21:06.532 --> 21:09.233
I'm really not as big of a screwup
as you...

21:28.220 --> 21:29.720
I'm out.
