WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:01.626
Previously on House.

00:01.752 --> 00:02.752
You high, popo?

00:02.878 --> 00:04.587
A cop with a sense of humor.

00:04.713 --> 00:06.714
You check the cop car.

00:06.840 --> 00:09.384
Also check his personal car, work, home.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.594
Foreman, get out!

00:11.720 --> 00:13.262
Am I the only one who finds this funny?

00:13.389 --> 00:15.098
You stole my article.
I wouldn't do that.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.266
We're not friends. We're colleagues.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.060
Son of a bitch!

00:19.186 --> 00:21.646
- Now we're both exposed.
- In ten minutes' time...

00:21.772 --> 00:24.107
You die, I die. It's not gonna happen.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.110
Time of death. 12:26 p.m.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.281
I need a bone saw.

00:32.408 --> 00:34.367
- I'm sorry. I wish I could.
- They said you won't...

00:34.493 --> 00:36.911
I just want a little tiny slice
of this guy's brain.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.830
Just enough to tell me
what's killing Foreman.

00:38.956 --> 00:42.750
A thin slice of Joe's brain
could also cause a public health crisis.

00:42.876 --> 00:45.670
It's not a good idea to scream "fire"
every time somebody lights a match.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.338
Don't downplay this, House.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.716
You put both of them in isolation
for a reason.

00:49.842 --> 00:53.594
Joe's death elevates this situation
to a Biosafety Level 3.

00:53.721 --> 00:57.181
- Level 3. Did you call Jack Bauer?
- I called the CDC.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.183
Well, tell them
I'll be really, really careful.

00:59.309 --> 01:02.061
We don't have the proper equipment
for you to be really, really careful.

01:02.187 --> 01:05.314
You can do whatever you want to Foreman,
but the CDC will do this autopsy.

01:05.441 --> 01:08.151
Whatever. The point is, we'll be lucky
to get results in three days.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.361
- I told them how urgent this is.
- And they told you...

01:10.487 --> 01:12.238
"We'll have the results in three days."

01:12.364 --> 01:15.408
Oh, that's a shame. Because Foreman
will never get to know what it was.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.827
He'll be dead in 36 hours.

01:17.953 --> 01:20.371
Maybe this is a toxin.
Maybe it's not contagious at all.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.623
You're killing Foreman
because of a "maybe."

01:22.750 --> 01:26.043
Well, you have 36 hours
to figure out which one it is.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.595
Foreman. Come here, fast.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.431
What's going on?
When are they doing the autopsy?

01:38.557 --> 01:40.057
You're doing it, now.

01:40.184 --> 01:42.393
You ever studied how they used
to do ice pick lobotomies?

01:42.519 --> 01:44.353
I read about it in med school.
Why would I...

01:44.480 --> 01:47.190
Shove an ice pick into the eye socket
just above the tear duct,

01:47.316 --> 01:49.317
bang it a couple times with a hammer,
get a sample.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.402
- What's going on, House?
- Foreman, you can't do it!

01:51.528 --> 01:55.031
- You'd be in violation of...
- Can't do the time if you're not alive.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.033
You! I need you to suit up.

01:57.159 --> 01:58.910
Get that equipment away
from Dr. Foreman.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.954
Take your time, guys.
Just tell them to go slow.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.080
It won't be your fault.

02:03.207 --> 02:05.750
Foreman, we don't know what kind
of contagion we're dealing with.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.794
Which is why we need
to chop into the guy's head!

02:07.920 --> 02:09.253
- It's dangerous.
- Not to you!

02:09.379 --> 02:11.172
There are other ways to diagnose you.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.090
Yeah? You have the answer?

02:14.051 --> 02:17.303
- Foreman, do it now!
- I am warning you! Do not...

02:22.309 --> 02:24.477
- What are you doing?
- That didn't feel right.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.438
He's blind.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.940
But he thinks he can see.

02:30.234 --> 02:31.484
Same as the cop.

02:31.610 --> 02:32.985
We need something to bag the sample.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.112
Forget it. You just biopsied a mattress.

02:35.239 --> 02:39.283
No, no, no. I'm fine. House,
there's the sample. Get it, test it!

02:39.993 --> 02:41.410
You got to test that sample!

02:41.537 --> 02:44.205
Apparently I was optimistic
about the 36 hours.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.584
Intractable, unbearable pain is up next.

02:49.086 --> 02:52.129
Sure you don't wanna reconsider
that whole autopsy thing?

03:31.295 --> 03:35.965
Physically, his eyes are fine.
The problem's isolated to his brain.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.051
Damage to the occipital lobe extends
from the primary visual cortex...

03:39.177 --> 03:41.429
We should retest him
for bacterial meningitis.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.347
If it was meningitis, we'd all be sick.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.807
His CSF might show signs...

03:44.933 --> 03:47.727
LP's pointless.
We already did a brain biopsy.

03:47.853 --> 03:49.437
It was negative.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.150
- Toxic mold.
- If it was toxic mold, I'd be sick.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.486
- How do we know you're not sick?
- Do I seem happy to you?

03:57.613 --> 03:59.947
Never.

04:00.616 --> 04:01.490
It was funny.

04:01.617 --> 04:03.534
Well, let's assume it's not blood-borne.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.329
If you start cracking jokes,
we can reassess.

04:06.455 --> 04:09.707
In the meantime, stay away from
people and animals that you care about.

04:15.756 --> 04:16.964
Guillain Barré.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.175
Neither of them had
any sort of paralysis.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.761
Joe could have died before
the paralysis had a chance to present.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.972
- What about arbovirus?
- Start treatment.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.517
For arbovirus? You think our Jersey beat
cop has been spending a lot of time

04:28.644 --> 04:29.977
exploring deep, dark Africa?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.396
Treatment for everything,
likely or unlikely.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.273
If you can think of it, treat for it.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.276
Mixing that many meds will create
all sorts of toxic interactions.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.237
We'll box his liver, trash his kidneys.
There's got to be a better way.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.198
Of course there's a better way!

04:42.324 --> 04:46.369
It's that body sitting in the room
with him that Cuddy won't let us touch!

04:47.663 --> 04:52.166
Bacterials, virals, toxins, fungals,
parasites, it's got to be one of them.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.793
Where are you going?

04:53.919 --> 04:56.587
See if I can find another brain
to biopsy.

04:58.090 --> 05:01.300
They're gonna lock Joe up downstairs
until the CDC gets here.

05:03.387 --> 05:05.429
Foreman, you can't see.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.556
Right.

05:07.683 --> 05:10.309
House wants to start you on some meds.
They're in the air lock.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.187
- For what?
- Leading candidate is toxic mold.

05:13.897 --> 05:17.024
- Is Cameron sick?
- I'm fine, thanks for asking.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.070
You're casting your net a little wider
than toxic mold, aren't you?

05:21.196 --> 05:23.197
Guillain Barré is also on the table.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.784
This is an oval shape.
That's either an "L" or a "7."

05:26.910 --> 05:30.830
I'm guessing an "L." Levofloxacin,
because you can't rule out bacteria.

05:31.331 --> 05:35.334
8-0-0. That's the dosage for acyclovir
in case it's viral.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.337
Square. No, more like a rhombus.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.632
That's fluconazole for fungus.
There's about eight others here.

05:41.758 --> 05:44.427
You're treating me for everything.
You have no idea what I've got.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.345
House thinks this is
the best course of action.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.639
House is desperate.
House is never desperate.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.433
Something we give you will work.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.977
Yeah, we should start treating
all patients this way.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.271
When they get sick,
they just take everything.

05:55.397 --> 05:56.897
It's better than doing nothing.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.057
- Hello?
- I'm at the cop's place.

06:31.475 --> 06:32.808
I need to retrace your steps.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.686
You don't think the "treat him
for everything" approach is enough?

06:35.812 --> 06:38.147
- Where did you start your search?
- The kitchen.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.775
OK, well, tell me everything you did,
everything you touched.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.235
If you went to the john,
I want to know when and why.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.155
It started with samples
from the mold in his sink.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.837
- What next?
- That's it. Then I left.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.672
What do we do now?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.508
Wait for Steve McQueen to get giddy.

07:05.634 --> 07:07.301
Excellent plan.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.613
Hey, Dad, it's Eric.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.075
I'm not doing too good.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.413
How's Foreman?

07:38.875 --> 07:41.961
- You're accessing a webcam?
- Cuddy's shower.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.964
Are you a fan of the Brazilian? I...

07:45.507 --> 07:46.799
Is that your kitchen?

07:46.925 --> 07:48.592
Well, obviously
I couldn't bring him here.

07:48.718 --> 07:50.553
He's been exposed
to whatever Foreman's got.

07:50.679 --> 07:54.014
You infected Steve? Why didn't you
just get a rat from the pet store?

07:54.141 --> 07:57.560
Because I needed one
with a clean medical history.

07:57.686 --> 08:01.021
Who knows what kind of antibiotics
they gave those rats?

08:01.148 --> 08:04.525
So this is your plan, just sit here
and watch your rat all day?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.402
It shouldn't take long.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.239
I've got the AC blasting,
I soaked the floor of his cage.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.616
As soon as he gets sick,
I do an autopsy.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.909
As soon as he's dead.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.912
Right after he gets sick, there's a good
chance he'll get hit in the head

08:17.038 --> 08:19.665
with a cane-shaped object.

08:19.791 --> 08:22.793
Normally you just use your patients
as lab rats.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.838
It's a nice change.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.469
First symptom is euphoria.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.763
Well, how do you know
if a rat's euphoric?

08:34.890 --> 08:38.309
He doesn't usually climb on
his water bottle like that, does he?

08:44.441 --> 08:47.526
The seizures only seem to happen
when she's in her car seat.

08:47.652 --> 08:50.529
She starts to rock and grunt.

08:50.655 --> 08:53.699
- Is she responsive?
- No, no. It's like she's in a zone

08:53.825 --> 08:57.286
and her abdominal muscles
become dystonic.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.123
Big word.
Someone's been on the Interweb.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.417
I looked up a few articles on epilepsy.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.836
There's actually
some really great youth soccer leagues

09:05.962 --> 09:08.464
that would cater
specifically to her special needs,

09:08.590 --> 09:11.884
and I think it might explain why she's
been having a hard time in preschool.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.554
Well, let's confirm your diagnosis
before you have her held back.

09:15.680 --> 09:19.767
Strobing lights and high-pitched sounds
can provoke a seizure.

09:24.940 --> 09:28.359
- You're a goof.
- Takes one to know one, loser.

09:28.485 --> 09:31.320
Wait, that means I'm a loser.
Scratch that.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.782
These episodes,
she gets sweaty afterwards?

09:34.908 --> 09:36.367
Soaking wet.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.787
And does she seem upset by them
or just tired?

09:39.913 --> 09:41.872
No. She kind of thinks it's funny.

09:41.998 --> 09:46.710
You mix rocking, grunting, sweating
and dystonia with concerned parents

09:46.836 --> 09:49.713
and you get an amateur diagnosis
of epilepsy.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.883
In actuality,
all your little girl is doing

09:53.009 --> 09:55.594
is saying "yoo-hoo to the hoo-hoo."

09:56.221 --> 09:58.555
- She's what?
- Marching the penguin.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.517
Ya-ya-ing the sisterhood.

10:01.643 --> 10:03.894
Finding Nemo.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.356
That was funny.

10:07.482 --> 10:10.442
It's called "gratification disorder."
Sort of a misnomer.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.362
If one was unable to gratify oneself,
that would be a disorder.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.364
Are you saying she's masturbating?

10:15.490 --> 10:18.242
I was trying to be discreet.
There's a child in the room.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.328
- This is horrifying.
- Epilepsy is horrifying.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.081
Teach your girl about privacy
and she'll be fine.

10:24.207 --> 10:26.208
- There you go.
- Thank you.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.338
One afternoon,
and you're on pace to set the record

10:31.464 --> 10:33.340
for most patients seen in a month.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.050
You're upset that I'm doing
clinic hours?

10:35.176 --> 10:36.885
Wow, that is so like rain
on your wedding day.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.180
For the past three hours, I have been on
the phone with the CDC while you are...

10:40.307 --> 10:42.641
- How's that going, by the way?
- They promised to expedite...

10:42.767 --> 10:45.019
Tough to do an autopsy when
they haven't picked up the body.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.855
It's tough to treat your patient
when you're not even on the same floor.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.482
- Go. Clinic is covered.
- I watch the meds drip into his IV,

10:50.608 --> 10:52.151
that'll make the treatment work faster?

10:52.277 --> 10:53.819
Go to your office, play with your ball,

10:53.945 --> 10:55.946
write on your white board,
insult your team.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.490
Do whatever it is that you do
to figure things out.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.535
Feeling guilty?
It's not too late to change your mind.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.537
Go call the CDC,
tell them you were just joshing.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.290
Keep avoiding Foreman's case
until he dies.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.083
Then I'll drown in guilt.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.836
Feeling any better?

11:11.963 --> 11:14.631
- How are you doing?
- I'm not the patient.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.759
Is your sed rate elevated?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.137
No. So far, it looks like I lucked out.

11:21.306 --> 11:25.642
Cameron, it looks like you left
the tourniquet on the bed.

11:28.229 --> 11:31.398
- You can see again?
- The treatment's working.

11:32.776 --> 11:34.735
The question is, which treatment?

11:34.861 --> 11:38.614
We'll start weaning him off one at
a time. Which one do we start with?

11:38.740 --> 11:40.366
I don't care if you do it
alphabetically.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.700
Just stay on top of his vision.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.328
First sign of regression means
we've taken him off the wrong one.

11:44.454 --> 11:48.874
Latest blood work. Foreman's amylase and
lipase levels are three times normal.

11:49.000 --> 11:52.252
- The pancreas is failing.
- A toxic side effect of his meds.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.825
Philosophical question:
How do you wanna die?

12:23.535 --> 12:24.993
Old age.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.289
Your choice is currently between 4 hours
from now and 14 hours from now.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.208
So I'm assuming that means
you want the latter.

12:31.334 --> 12:35.170
The cocktail's working.
My vision's almost completely restored.

12:35.296 --> 12:38.507
The meds are curing what's in your head,
but they're trashing your pancreas.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.301
That's why you're puking and you
can't stand up without screaming.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.137
So lower the dosages.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.806
Less stress on my pancreas,
still battle the infection.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.725
- Lower dosages will still be toxic.
- I don't care!

12:49.602 --> 12:51.812
I can handle the pain
of the pancreatitis.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.606
I don't think you can handle life
without a pancreas.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.529
If we keep you on these meds,

13:00.655 --> 13:04.366
you'll spend the last four hours
of your life being able to see.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.952
We take you off, you'll go blind again.

13:07.078 --> 13:11.290
But it'll give us time to figure out
what's eating your brain.

13:15.378 --> 13:18.422
Fine. What do we do next?

13:18.965 --> 13:20.174
Eric?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.304
Dad?

13:29.809 --> 13:33.687
Yeah, you two can get caught up later.
Sir, I need you to come with me.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.068
House, what is this?

13:40.195 --> 13:44.031
He's not a "what," he's a "who."
They even have the right to vote now.

13:44.157 --> 13:47.326
Rodney Foreman, Cuddy.
Cuddy, Rodney Foreman.

13:48.203 --> 13:50.746
Nice to meet you, ma'am.
This is Foreman's dad.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.164
Yeah, I got that.

13:52.290 --> 13:54.500
And Dr. Cuddy here
is the Dean of Medicine.

13:54.626 --> 13:56.752
Remember that cool autopsy
I was telling you about,

13:56.878 --> 13:58.837
the one that would save your son's life?

13:58.963 --> 14:00.964
She's the one who can give us
the green light to do it.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.301
I understand you don't want them
to do it.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.221
Dr. House didn't seem to know why.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.061
Mr. Foreman, I am doing everything I can
to get the CDC...

14:14.187 --> 14:16.855
- Won't be soon enough.
...and my decision to follow

14:16.981 --> 14:18.857
public health safety protocols...

14:18.983 --> 14:23.153
Oh, don't blame the rules.
Don't hang this on policy and protocol.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.073
I'm well aware that
it may cost your son his life,

14:26.199 --> 14:29.284
just as I am well aware that my decision
has a devastating effect

14:29.410 --> 14:33.038
on family and friends, without
having them paraded in front of me.

14:33.164 --> 14:36.416
Your son has an unknown,

14:36.543 --> 14:39.086
contagious, deadly infection.

14:39.754 --> 14:43.882
If we don't contain it here,
even more people could be at risk.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.427
And I am capable of empathizing
with those people too,

14:47.554 --> 14:49.763
without having them
paraded in front of me.

15:02.068 --> 15:03.819
I understand.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.879
What's wrong with your hand?

15:23.006 --> 15:25.340
It's called a muscle contracture.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.926
I thought this thing was in your brain.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.929
It is. It just means
the infection's moved

15:31.055 --> 15:33.765
to the primary motor cortex,
which controls the muscles.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.894
Aren't you glad you sent me
to med school?

15:38.021 --> 15:40.731
- Does it hurt?
- No.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.066
Is it gonna?

15:45.862 --> 15:47.529
The other guy...

15:49.282 --> 15:51.325
...he didn't seem to suffer too much.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.118
He just went in his sleep.

16:03.755 --> 16:07.341
Steve's still acting normal.
No sign of contractures.

16:08.134 --> 16:11.720
They got the cop's body
in a locked, airtight bag.

16:11.846 --> 16:16.058
And a guard on the door.
Those feds are seriously paranoid.

16:16.184 --> 16:18.644
He hasn't gotten up to pee in hours.
He's due.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.355
You haven't sprinkled
Senokot granules on his donut?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.231
His bowels would open up
like the Red Sea.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.524
He wouldn't eat the donut.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.362
Have you seriously
been down here for hours?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.571
No.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.115
I had to pee a couple times.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.326
You've got to stop
blaming Cuddy for this.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.411
Given that it is her fault,
that seems appropriate.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.080
That part is her fault.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.374
The part where somebody
wasted his time in the basement

16:40.500 --> 16:43.210
plotting the overthrow of a government
agency, that one's on you.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.838
Only thing I can do is think.
You can pretty much do that anywhere.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.757
As long as no one's bugging me.

16:52.345 --> 16:53.887
Did you call your brother?

16:54.013 --> 16:55.597
No.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.643
- Did you?
- No.

17:01.437 --> 17:03.438
It's not a big deal.

17:04.732 --> 17:07.359
I sure would have liked to see Mom,
though.

17:10.947 --> 17:13.407
You know she can't travel anymore.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.576
You tell her?

17:17.787 --> 17:19.204
Why?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.749
Just upset her for a while.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.255
Then she wouldn't remember for a while.

17:33.428 --> 17:35.053
She should know.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.558
She's lost a lot of who she was.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.898
She can't deal with something like this.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.444
And you can?

17:54.365 --> 17:58.410
I still know you're going
to a better place.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.417
It's easy for you, isn't it?

18:06.878 --> 18:11.757
As long as you believe I'm going
to a better place, dying ain't so bad.

18:12.383 --> 18:16.219
I don't want you to be afraid.

18:17.764 --> 18:21.808
If I'm not afraid of dying, what
the hell should I be afraid of, Dad?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.897
I thought you believed.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.816
I did.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.320
I'm not so sure anymore.

18:39.911 --> 18:42.454
I'm going to pray for you, Son.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.876
I suggest you do the same.

19:37.969 --> 19:41.763
Field of vision is regressing and
he's reached an eight on the pain scale.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.224
The disease pattern is following
the exact course as Joe's.

19:44.350 --> 19:46.017
Only it's moving much faster in Foreman.

19:46.143 --> 19:49.938
Good. It's an anomaly.
Anomalies tell us things.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.232
Why would this go faster in Foreman?
What's different?

19:52.358 --> 19:54.359
Could be a different strain
of the same disease?

19:54.485 --> 19:57.070
Right! We were wasting all this time
looking for an unknown disease.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.906
We should have be looking for a
different strain of an unknown disease.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.284
Joe's a cop. He's into physical fitness.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.996
He could have had a more powerful
immune system, stronger metabolism.

20:06.122 --> 20:07.539
Foreman's black.

20:07.665 --> 20:10.625
What? How long have you been
sitting on this information?

20:10.751 --> 20:15.005
Lupus, gout, glaucoma, osteoarthritis,
hypertension, diabetes, stop me anytime,

20:15.131 --> 20:17.173
they all affect black people
more than whites.

20:17.300 --> 20:18.592
Check everything.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.094
Bacterials, fungals, toxins, parasites.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.680
Look for anything
with a documented racial disparity.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.226
Wait.

20:29.312 --> 20:31.438
- The rat's showing symptoms?
- No.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.232
He's completely healthy.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.527
Maybe that's the difference
between Foreman and the cop.

20:42.783 --> 20:44.284
How you feeling?

20:45.494 --> 20:46.870
Why are you here?

20:46.996 --> 20:49.748
Because you're a friend,
and I should be here.

20:55.046 --> 20:58.214
I'm sorry House used my dad
to try and manipulate you.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.301
You've got integrity.
You aren't going to change your mind

21:01.427 --> 21:03.887
just because you're confronted
by my father.

21:04.013 --> 21:04.971
Thank you.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.515
Just like I'm not gonna forgive you,

21:07.642 --> 21:10.518
just because you come by here
and ask how I'm feeling.

21:10.645 --> 21:14.064
- You know I've had no choice.
- Of course you had a choice!

21:14.190 --> 21:15.815
Regulations are clear.

21:15.942 --> 21:19.277
And the punishment
for violating those regulations,

21:19.403 --> 21:21.696
is it death? Hmm?

21:21.822 --> 21:26.451
Because frankly, I'm OK
if you get a fine, a suspension...

21:26.577 --> 21:31.748
Hell, you can spend a couple years
in jail if it saves my life!

21:33.542 --> 21:36.252
- You're dying too fast.
- Couldn't agree more.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.005
Hey, Cuddy. Having a nice visit?

21:39.840 --> 21:41.633
What's that?

21:42.134 --> 21:44.719
Legionella... Legionella pneumophilia.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.223
And why are you carrying
a vial of it around with you?

21:48.349 --> 21:50.892
Foreman was perfectly healthy
before he got this infection,

21:51.018 --> 21:53.687
but our cop wasn't.
He had Legionnaire's disease,

21:53.813 --> 21:57.273
and our cop didn't turn into brain food
until we cured the Legionella.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.901
The Legionella slowed down the disease.

22:00.027 --> 22:01.903
Why would that happen?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.905
No idea. I just know that it did.

22:04.031 --> 22:05.824
So you want to infect Foreman?

22:05.950 --> 22:07.617
You gonna tattle to the CDC?

22:07.743 --> 22:10.370
The meds can't help me,
but a disease can?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.872
Forget it. Just take the pain away.
Put me under.

22:12.999 --> 22:15.500
If I put you under,
I can't monitor your pain.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.503
If I can't monitor your pain, I won't
know if the Legionella's working.

22:18.629 --> 22:21.006
I'm not consenting to you giving me...

22:21.841 --> 22:23.591
- What was that?
- Hmm.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.178
Wish there could have been
a puff of smoke or something.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.222
Would have been much more dramatic.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.641
Keep your slippers on.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.436
Wouldn't want you to cut your foot.

22:37.815 --> 22:39.816
You feeling any better?

22:39.942 --> 22:43.278
I can't breathe. I'm dizzy
and I can barely hear anything

22:43.404 --> 22:45.989
- over the sounds of my lungs crackling.
- That's the Legionella.

22:46.115 --> 22:48.867
Oh, you figured that out
from the symptoms

22:48.993 --> 22:50.702
or from the vial of stuff
tossed in my room?

22:50.828 --> 22:53.705
I'm trying to be professional here,
and there's no reason to be nasty.

22:53.831 --> 22:55.290
- I'm in pain.
- So is House.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.624
And he's a delight.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.085
He doesn't try to kill his colleagues.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.379
You can remove the thermometer now.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.973
It's down almost a whole degree.
How's the pain?

23:12.099 --> 23:14.434
Great. It's the good kind.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.103
How bad is it compared to an hour ago?

23:18.731 --> 23:19.814
No worse.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.366
Is the Legionella helping?

23:32.828 --> 23:33.953
Yeah.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.289
- Good.
- But not great.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.750
It didn't fix anything,
it just slowed it down.

23:38.876 --> 23:41.419
The whole point was to give Steve
a little more time to get sick.

23:41.545 --> 23:43.963
What are you gonna do
if he never gets sick?

23:45.174 --> 23:46.966
Brilliant.

23:48.552 --> 23:53.014
Cameron, what type of illnesses
affect humans but not rats?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.849
Why are you asking me that?

23:54.975 --> 23:57.310
Because I'm sure that you spent
the first 12 years of your life

23:57.436 --> 24:00.230
dreaming of being a vet.
The rat is not getting sick.

24:00.356 --> 24:02.190
- Cameron is not getting sick.
- Sorry.

24:02.316 --> 24:04.109
It's OK, it's not your fault.

24:04.235 --> 24:07.612
Presumably, you're still healthy because
whatever it is, it's not blood-borne.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.989
Steve has no excuse.
He did everything that Foreman did.

24:10.116 --> 24:12.575
Some bacterial infections
don't affect rats.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.828
Foreman tested negative
for every bacterial infection

24:14.954 --> 24:17.038
- that would affect his brain.
- And what infections

24:17.164 --> 24:20.416
could he be positive for
but test negative for?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.170
When we test for infections,
we look for antibodies.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.382
Now, what if the patient is infected
but has no antibodies?

24:27.508 --> 24:29.384
What if the body
is not fighting the infection?

24:29.510 --> 24:32.095
- Why would...
- I asked first.

24:32.221 --> 24:34.597
Let's start with the "what."
We'll deal with the "why" later.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.600
If the body doesn't recognize the
infection, our tests come back negative,

24:37.726 --> 24:39.769
and the disease rampages
through the body unstopped.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.730
Exactly like the cop
and exactly like Foreman.

24:42.857 --> 24:45.733
Now, what if the patient was then
exposed to a second infection,

24:45.860 --> 24:48.444
like Legionella? The body
would recognize that infection,

24:48.571 --> 24:50.989
increase the white count,
send in the troops to start fighting,

24:51.115 --> 24:53.658
and the initial infection
would get caught in the crossfire.

24:53.784 --> 24:56.494
So the question becomes
what type of bacterial infection

24:56.620 --> 24:58.079
affects humans but not rats,

24:58.205 --> 25:00.540
and the human body
would be unlikely to recognize?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.877
The answer is listeria.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.004
I'm starting you on amp and gent.

25:06.130 --> 25:09.299
So, you're basing this theory
on the tests being negative

25:09.425 --> 25:10.884
and your rat being healthy?

25:11.010 --> 25:12.969
And the fact that
Legionnaire's is helping you.

25:13.095 --> 25:16.514
But the medicine you want to give me
will put an end to that.

25:16.640 --> 25:17.682
Yeah.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.185
And if it's not listeria,
all the gent will do

25:20.311 --> 25:22.020
is cure the Legionnaire's disease

25:22.146 --> 25:24.606
and put whatever is killing me
back into overdrive.

25:24.732 --> 25:28.067
Stop asking me questions
based on the premise that I'm wrong.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.657
The antibiotics are in the airlock.

25:37.661 --> 25:40.830
I think the first biopsy
didn't give us the answer

25:40.956 --> 25:42.540
because you didn't go deep enough.

25:44.084 --> 25:47.545
I want you to do
a white matter brain biopsy.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.547
Absolutely. Don't blame you.

25:49.673 --> 25:53.009
The world is such a complicated place
if you've got higher reasoning skills.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.346
I'm often jealous of small animals
and retarded children.

25:56.472 --> 25:57.889
Take the antibiotics.

25:58.015 --> 26:01.851
There can be minimal damage
if it's done right,

26:01.977 --> 26:04.145
if the surgeons drill
where I tell them to drill.

26:04.271 --> 26:07.065
One slip, you could spend
the rest of your life not being able

26:07.191 --> 26:10.652
- to keep your drool in your mouth.
- I'd rather be disabled than dead.

26:10.778 --> 26:12.570
Sure! I make it look oh-so-sexy.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.697
It's actually not as glamorous
as you might think.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.617
The biopsy will tell us for sure
what's wrong.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.744
The antibiotics could do the same thing!

26:19.870 --> 26:22.330
- "Could," not "will."
- We try it, we see.

26:22.456 --> 26:25.083
The antibiotics
will bring back the pain!

26:33.384 --> 26:35.927
Pain makes us make bad decisions.

26:38.722 --> 26:42.725
Fear of pain
is almost as big a motivator.

26:44.895 --> 26:47.355
Look, we still have time.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.777
I will do that biopsy if I have to.
But not a moment before.

27:11.797 --> 27:15.049
Start Foreman on IV antibiotics.
Where's his dad?

27:15.175 --> 27:17.510
Where you're supposed to be
when your son is dying.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.221
- He's not with him.
- He's in the chapel.

27:20.347 --> 27:21.889
Oh, man...

27:25.144 --> 27:28.229
I started your son on
a new course of treatment.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.441
If it works, he'll get better.

27:31.567 --> 27:33.484
If it doesn't, he won't.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.031
While he's not getting better,

27:38.157 --> 27:40.825
he's going to experience so much pain

27:40.951 --> 27:43.536
that we'll have to put him
in a chemically-induced coma

27:43.662 --> 27:45.788
while we figure out what to do next.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.750
My son says
you're a manipulative bastard.

27:49.668 --> 27:52.337
It's a pet name. I call him "Dr. Bling."

27:53.881 --> 27:56.549
I assume you're here for a reason.
What do you want from me?

27:58.427 --> 28:00.636
When your son is in a coma...

28:01.472 --> 28:04.640
...you're the one who's gonna have to
make the medical decisions for him.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.476
Whatever you decide is fine.

28:08.354 --> 28:12.148
- You don't care what I do?
- I'm not a doctor. What do I know,

28:12.274 --> 28:14.192
except what Eric tells me?

28:16.028 --> 28:18.780
He says you're the best doctor
he's ever worked with.

28:33.504 --> 28:35.421
I need your help.

28:35.547 --> 28:37.256
There's nothing I can give you
for the pain.

28:37.383 --> 28:38.716
I want to be put out.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.468
I can have a nurse in here
in five minutes.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.261
No.

28:42.388 --> 28:45.598
Once I'm out, I might not come back.

28:47.184 --> 28:48.643
I've never done a will.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.522
I'll call a lawyer for you.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.608
I want you to be my medical proxy.

28:57.528 --> 29:01.364
All the things that piss me off
about you in House's office,

29:01.490 --> 29:04.200
you're too emotional and too caring,
too cautious...

29:04.326 --> 29:06.577
They're all good things on this floor.

29:08.997 --> 29:10.873
- Your dad is...
- No.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.917
- He cares about you.
- So do you.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.919
I can't do this.

29:17.005 --> 29:20.842
We expect family members to make
decisions about their loved ones

29:20.968 --> 29:23.970
after a ten-minute briefing,
that we're agonizing over

29:24.096 --> 29:26.013
even with years of medical experience.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.016
That's from my article.

29:31.645 --> 29:34.188
I'm sorry, Allison.

29:34.314 --> 29:38.359
I shouldn't have stolen your article.
I shouldn't have exposed you.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.486
You were a friend.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.822
I need to know that we're OK.

29:50.372 --> 29:52.290
No.

29:52.416 --> 29:55.084
I'll be your proxy, but we're not OK.

29:57.171 --> 29:59.505
You're scared you're dying
and it's the only reason

29:59.631 --> 30:01.340
you want to set things right.

30:01.467 --> 30:05.595
We're gonna get you better first
and then...

30:06.930 --> 30:09.891
...if you still wanna apologize,
I'll be around.

30:12.102 --> 30:13.728
I'll call that lawyer.

30:29.411 --> 30:31.829
- Any improvements?
- No. As far as we can tell,

30:31.955 --> 30:34.749
the only thing the antibiotics
are treating is the Legionella.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.001
I think we need to consider
alternate theories.

30:37.127 --> 30:39.128
- Like what?
- We do the biopsy. We...

30:39.254 --> 30:41.255
Give the antibiotics more time.

30:41.381 --> 30:44.008
There is no more time.
The pain is almost unbearable already.

30:44.134 --> 30:47.720
So he's almost in unbearable pain.
He's not almost dead!

30:48.889 --> 30:50.598
Which means we have more time.

30:59.483 --> 31:01.108
Mr. Foreman?

31:04.988 --> 31:07.365
We need to put your son in a coma.

31:10.077 --> 31:11.536
You should be there.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.580
It's a medical procedure, right?

31:15.457 --> 31:16.582
Yeah.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.836
But once we put him out,
if we don't solve this...

31:22.464 --> 31:24.173
...he won't wake up.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.552
What should I say?

31:28.095 --> 31:32.139
Should I talk to him
like it's going to be OK?

31:34.434 --> 31:36.602
Or should I be saying goodbye?

31:37.813 --> 31:41.649
I need to know what people say when...

31:41.775 --> 31:43.234
Just tell him you love him.

32:07.718 --> 32:10.678
- Hey, Son.
- Hey, Dad.

32:13.890 --> 32:15.391
It's going to be OK.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.186
You don't know that.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.691
I know.

32:25.611 --> 32:27.320
You don't.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.623
I don't wanna miss you.

32:41.668 --> 32:42.960
I love you too, Dad.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.472
Hey.

32:56.058 --> 32:58.017
It's gonna be OK.

33:01.438 --> 33:04.231
- Can we do this now?
- Yeah, of course.

33:17.996 --> 33:20.247
I accept your apology.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.564
Why weren't you with Foreman?

33:45.899 --> 33:49.860
I hang out in the basement, you rag on
me. I stay in my office, you rag on me.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.488
- Honky just can't buy a break.
- Do the biopsy.

33:53.573 --> 33:56.826
Based on the cop's progression, I figure
he's got about another four hours...

33:56.952 --> 33:58.285
You figure?

33:58.870 --> 34:01.664
You're playing Russian roulette,
but the gun's pointed at him.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.083
No. Cutting open his head
is what's dangerous.

34:04.209 --> 34:06.919
Oh, it's dangerous.
Well, what would people think?

34:07.045 --> 34:09.797
The reason you don't see patients
is because if you know them,

34:09.923 --> 34:11.507
- you'll give a crap.
- I know you.

34:11.633 --> 34:13.843
If you give a crap,
you stop making outrageous calls.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.137
If this was any other patient,
you'd have damned the risk

34:16.263 --> 34:17.972
and cut their head open a long time ago.

34:18.098 --> 34:19.974
He's out.
The EEG shows he's still in pain.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.934
The antibiotics have had
more than enough time.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.227
We're doing the brain biopsy.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.521
Not unless you people can't come up
with something clever

34:25.647 --> 34:28.482
- in the next three hours.
- Now. We're doing it now.

34:28.608 --> 34:31.193
- Well, who died and made you boss?
- Foreman.

34:40.829 --> 34:42.955
- It's legal.
- He's out of his mind.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.791
Yesterday he was giggling
about a hole in a guy's head.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.545
Then hire a lawyer and challenge it.
In the meantime, Cameron's in charge.

34:49.671 --> 34:53.048
- Why would he sign that?
- It's nothing personal, Mr. Foreman.

34:53.175 --> 34:57.803
My son doesn't trust me.
How exactly is that not personal?

34:58.972 --> 35:00.306
I'm sorry.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.434
You're sorry?
You're talking about this man's son!

35:03.560 --> 35:07.021
- You're denying him the right to be...
- Oh, shut up, House.

35:07.689 --> 35:10.316
If you want to do the biopsy,
do the biopsy.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.611
If House tries to interfere, let me know
and I will take care of it.

35:13.737 --> 35:15.529
Yeah, you're a hero.
If it wasn't for you,

35:15.655 --> 35:19.784
we'd be cutting into a dead guy's
head instead of Foreman's.

35:21.161 --> 35:24.038
Sorry. Thanks.

35:27.209 --> 35:29.668
- That was great!
- It was rude and unnecessary.

35:29.795 --> 35:31.796
- Yeah.
- Go away.

35:31.922 --> 35:34.423
- Give me time.
- We're out of time.

35:34.549 --> 35:36.592
- An hour.
- What does "out of time" mean?

35:36.718 --> 35:38.427
His O2 sats are at 94 right now.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.472
As long as they're above 90, danger of
fatal arrhythmia doesn't increase.

35:41.598 --> 35:44.350
So what? There's no point in waiting.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.811
You were right. We should be cutting
into a corpse's head.

35:46.937 --> 35:50.189
Yeah, we should be, except the CDC's
got the cop's body under...

35:50.315 --> 35:51.941
There's got to be other bodies.

35:52.067 --> 35:54.151
You think this thing
has killed other people?

35:54.277 --> 35:55.402
No.

35:56.404 --> 36:00.199
That apartment was a dump. Just
because Steve McQueen didn't get sick

36:00.325 --> 36:03.869
doesn't mean some other vermin didn't.
You give me an hour, I go back there,

36:03.995 --> 36:07.498
I find a dead animal, I cut its head
open instead of Foreman's.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.792
Foreman's already on 100% oxygen.

36:12.128 --> 36:15.381
Once his O2 sats hit 90,
I can't wait any longer.

36:18.218 --> 36:19.844
Where's your suit?

36:22.222 --> 36:26.600
Either you'll find the answer or I'll
find the answer. It doesn't matter.

36:28.562 --> 36:32.189
Prep the drill. We've got to be
ready to go if we get the signal.

37:09.811 --> 37:12.229
- Ninety-two.
- I found a blind bird.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.648
Great. How fast can you get it in here?

37:14.774 --> 37:17.401
I'll know in about 30 seconds.

38:07.077 --> 38:09.286
You better have the bird.
The surgical team's in place.

38:09.412 --> 38:12.665
- I screwed up.
- How can you not capture a blind bird?

38:12.791 --> 38:15.960
That's not what I meant. I screwed up
the first time through this place.

38:16.086 --> 38:19.004
Foreman told you everywhere he went.
It's not "where," it's "when."

38:19.130 --> 38:21.131
He came here early afternoon.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.510
Me and Steve came through two hours
too late. You were six hours early.

38:24.636 --> 38:26.762
It's the water. The irrigation system
only pumps at...

38:26.888 --> 38:29.723
House! I tested the water!
The water's clean.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.162
- House.
- We tested the wrong water.

39:33.288 --> 39:36.915
He stole cable, he stole fertilizer
and he stole water.

39:37.042 --> 39:40.169
- It's riddled with Naegleria.
- I know.

39:41.755 --> 39:43.756
You already did the biopsy.

39:44.716 --> 39:47.176
I thought I had no choice.

39:59.355 --> 40:01.315
How's my son?

40:02.317 --> 40:05.444
He has primary amoebic
meningoencephalitis.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.988
It's a parasite
that goes through the nose

40:08.114 --> 40:11.116
and migrates into the brain,
where it feeds on brain cells.

40:11.242 --> 40:15.579
The Legionella attacked the parasite.
That's why the disease slowed down.

40:16.498 --> 40:19.583
- Is it treatable?
- We started him on an antiparasitic

40:19.709 --> 40:22.669
and the amoebas
will clear out of his system.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.964
And he'll be OK?

40:27.175 --> 40:29.426
Then we'll wean him out of the coma...

40:29.552 --> 40:31.428
Will he be OK?

40:33.264 --> 40:36.975
There'll be no lasting damage
from the parasite.

40:39.771 --> 40:40.979
But the surgery?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.151
We don't know.

41:27.986 --> 41:29.862
Up and at 'em.

41:32.282 --> 41:34.074
How you feeling?

41:35.118 --> 41:36.952
Can you talk?

41:39.122 --> 41:41.373
I don't feel anything.

41:42.959 --> 41:44.209
Are you numb?

41:45.253 --> 41:48.088
No, I mean...

41:48.840 --> 41:50.841
...I don't feel any pain.

41:54.053 --> 41:57.055
Keep your head still. Follow my finger.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.686
- I'm OK.
- Your breath stinks,

42:02.812 --> 42:06.190
and you're peeing into a bag.
What are our names?

42:08.902 --> 42:11.111
You did the biopsy?

42:12.864 --> 42:15.073
- Thank you.
- Names?

42:16.409 --> 42:17.826
Cameron.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.494
My dad

42:19.621 --> 42:21.914
and the manipulative bastard.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.790
You remembered.

42:25.210 --> 42:27.753
- How you doing, Dad?
- Great.

42:28.838 --> 42:31.215
Relieved. Great.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.635
What did I have?

42:34.761 --> 42:37.888
Naegleria. Biopsy showed the amoeba,

42:38.014 --> 42:40.224
the CDC autopsy
eventually found the amoeba,

42:40.350 --> 42:43.101
and House found it in the water
on the cop's roof.

42:44.312 --> 42:47.439
- Wiggle your left toes.
- Wait. What?

42:47.565 --> 42:51.193
- You went back and she did the biopsy?
- Your left toes, Foreman.

42:52.362 --> 42:54.488
I just did.

42:55.657 --> 42:57.991
No, you didn't.

42:59.994 --> 43:02.579
- He can't move his toes.
- He can move them.

43:02.705 --> 43:05.040
Raise your right arm.

43:07.502 --> 43:08.877
What?
