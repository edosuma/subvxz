Perhaps you’ve just

Fatigue can prevent the body
from stimulating

No, they’re a mix
of calcite, mica flakes
and prehnite.

All pretty common in the quarry
where she was found.

03:38.594 --> 03:41.461

was filled with these crystals.

the shallow creek water,

Really bored now, guys.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.726
Yeah, and in the heat,
the water evaporated,

which caused the crystals
to stick to the bone.

that I taught, you know,

No, I mean why does Sweets think
that we have to work undercover?

11:26.478 --> 11:28.560
Well, the best motive
for killing Katarina Wirz...

Why can’t I just,

and ask questions?

11:53.130 --> 11:56.668
If the killer was motivated
enough to kill Katarina
to win the competition,

11:56.758 --> 11:58.214
why stop at her?

Now, one, two, three, go.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.632

It’s a one, two,

Hip swing.

Crunch. Crunch.

My calculations
have been double—checked,
so, theoretically.

21:24.033 --> 21:25.773
Practically,
not theoretically,

21:25.869 --> 21:28.781

all hope of solving
this case is lost.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.737
Well, you don’t really
have to put it like that.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.948
Well, I guess I’m just
a plainspoken cowboy.

10 minutes ago.

compromise the remains.
I’m confident, okay?

been soaked long enough
to dislodge the initial—

21:39.340 --> 21:40.955

Wow. We can finally

22:08.828 --> 22:11.615
Mm—hmm. Told ya.

Good afternoon, Dr. Brennan.
Um, should I ask?

22:21.591 --> 22:24.253
l’m undercover,
and I should be practicing.
What’s so important?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.585
Uh, would you
please take a look
at the victim’s teeth?

22:26.679 --> 22:28.795
You mean a photograph
of the victim’s teeth?

22:28.932 --> 22:31.014
Uh, yes, yes.
The distinction
is important.

22:31.100 --> 22:33.557
Uh, yes. I’m sorry.
Um, on the outside
of the tooth,

22:33.645 --> 22:36.307
the crystals formed
along the gum line,
but on the lingual surface—

22:36.397 --> 22:38.604
A lot more, yes.
Good work.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.024
Uh, Dr. Brennan, obviously,
that means something to you,
but I don’t see it.

22:42.111 --> 22:46.354
The enamel on the lingual
surface was eroded,
exposing the dentin and—

22:46.449 --> 22:48.940
Giving better purchase
to the crystals.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.035
Most likely caused by?
Oh, uh, a quiz.

22:52.121 --> 22:54.578

Um, stomach acid?

What would cause that?

22:59.295 --> 23:01.206
Uh, bulimia?
Possible.

23:01.297 --> 23:02.958
But let’s do
a histological review...

23:03.049 --> 23:05.916
to see if there are
any other indicators
of an eating disorder.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.001
Cause of death would be
much more helpful...

23:08.096 --> 23:09.882

Mr. Bray.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.463
I think I found that,
Dr. Brennan.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.140
Fracture and displacement
of the C2...

23:14.227 --> 23:16.559

of the C4 and C5.

No, hootenanny
is an informal gathering
for singing and dancing.

a question.

24:09.198 --> 24:11.450
This is a competition, pal.
Why would I help you?

24:11.534 --> 24:14.321
It’s not about
the competition.
Okay?

All right, shoot.
Oh, it’s about my partner.

Yeah, I’ve seen her.

24:19.709 --> 24:22.451

Right.

Whoa, we practice.
We practice.

of her game.

get yourself a new partner.

Are you sleeping
with your partner?

Can you break off
the personal stuff?
A little advice there.

24:51.908 --> 24:55.150
There is no link
between how good you are
on the dance floor...

24:55.244 --> 24:57.030
and how good you are
in the sack.

24:57.121 --> 25:00.705
That leaves brutal honesty.
Tell her she can’t dance.

25:00.792 --> 25:03.329
Ooh. No.
I can’t do that.
That’d be bad.

- Yeah, I want us to feast our
eyes on John Singer Sargent.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.719
All righty then.

25:56.806 --> 26:00.719

the people in his paintings
hold their arms.

Yes, Mr. Bray?

from the mass spec.

26:19.370 --> 26:21.076
Katarina Wirz
did not have bulimia.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.787
Just tell me.
She was poisoned.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.661
By what?
Lead—

26:25.752 --> 26:28.664
in doses that suggest
it could not have
been accidental.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.048
So, based on these readings,

26:35.136 --> 26:39.175
I’d say Katarina
was ingesting low levels of lead
over an extended period of time.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.926
But she didn’t die
of poisoning.

26:41.017 --> 26:44.259
No, based on the amount
that she ingested,
it wouldn’t have killed her.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.390
But wouldn’t she know
she was being poisoned?
I mean, wouldn’t you taste lead?

26:47.482 --> 26:51.395
Well, see, lead acetate
is a common, soluble
lead salt...

26:51.486 --> 26:54.023
also known as lead sugar
because it tastes so sweet.

26:54.113 --> 26:56.729
lsn’t lead acetate
used in men’s hair dye?

26:56.824 --> 26:59.691
- Yeah.
- I imagine a few of those
dancers dye their hair.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.698
Come on. Someone putting
hair dye in your food.
You’d taste that.

27:02.789 --> 27:06.657
Lead acetate is also used
in its salt form to dye fabric.

27:06.751 --> 27:10.039
Lead sugar in your food.
Yeah, well, you wouldn’t
taste that.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.040

the suspects to everyone

’Cause it’s not gonna be me.

the contestant list
against the Bureau’s files.

of dancers here, okay?

We need to know who we are
looking for, okay? So we can
narrow down the suspect pool.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.869
I’m afraid you’re asking
for the impossible.

27:48.960 --> 27:51.326
There’s no single profile
for those who poison.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.502
Well, the victim was poisoned
over the course of a year.

27:53.589 --> 27:56.296
Okay, well, that would indicate
someone in close proximity
to the victim.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.796
— That seems obvious.
- That was hostile.

28:00.513 --> 28:03.971
Hodgins said that the amount
of poison wasn’t enough
to kill the victim.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.676
Okay, that could indicate
that either the poisoner
was incompetent...

28:07.770 --> 28:09.385
or didn’t want to
kill the victim.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.471
Okay, would you like
to guess which?

28:11.566 --> 28:15.275
Well, since her neck was broken,
I’m gonna go with incompetent.

28:15.361 --> 28:19.479
When he realized the poisoning
wasn’t gonna work, he finished
her off in another way

28:19.574 --> 28:23.283

for a very determined,
but inexperienced killer.
