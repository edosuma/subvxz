00:02.900 --> 00:04.340
Admit it. We're lost.

00:04.350 --> 00:07.460
No,we're not. The Naveer Pass
is just beyond that ridge.

00:07.850 --> 00:10.200
Hey,Wizard,you know what
power I wish you had?

00:10.210 --> 00:11.640
The power to admit
when you're wrong.

00:11.660 --> 00:14.970
Right now I'd settle
for a silencing spell.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.920
At the next tavern, we're
asking for directions.

00:18.320 --> 00:20.560
- Kahlan.
- Wait.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.410
Kahlan Amnell?

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:38.760 --> 00:40.500
*******

00:47.810 --> 00:49.940
********

00:51.180 --> 00:55.660
My dear Kahlan,I knew
Mira would lead us to you.

00:59.870 --> 01:01.000
Serena?

01:01.020 --> 01:04.459
Zeddicus Zu'l
Zorander. My old friend.

01:04.470 --> 01:07.770
Mother Confessor?
This is Richard Cypher.

01:09.170 --> 01:11.370
The Seeker of Truth.

01:11.380 --> 01:13.510
This is truly an honor.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.200
Erin. Tara.

01:16.210 --> 01:17.960
Alana.

01:21.460 --> 01:23.370
I thought you were all in hiding.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.420
We were.

01:25.430 --> 01:29.200
But Darken Rahl's spies were
more insidious than we thought.

01:29.210 --> 01:32.130
They uncovered our houses of refu.

01:32.490 --> 01:35.620
There's no safety for Confessors
in the Midlands anymore.

01:35.640 --> 01:37.510
That's why we've been
searching for you.

01:37.530 --> 01:39.990
We must leave until the
time of Rahl's defeat.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.060
We have no choice but to
seek sanctuary in Valeria.

01:43.290 --> 01:44.980
Valeria?

01:44.990 --> 01:48.640
It's an island,hidden by
magic. Far off the coast.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.960
So you're fleeing?

01:49.990 --> 01:51.820
Only temporarily.

01:51.830 --> 01:54.780
When Rahl is vanquished
we will return.

01:54.800 --> 01:59.460
But Mother Confessor, we're the
source of justice in the Midlands.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.970
The people need us
now more than ever.

02:01.990 --> 02:04.380
Rahl wants a world without justice.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.040
And by killing us, he'll get it.

02:07.890 --> 02:11.140
We wanted to give you the
opportunity to join us.

02:15.240 --> 02:17.980
You know I can't
abandon my mission.

02:19.930 --> 02:22.100
I expected so.

02:22.110 --> 02:24.310
But the decision need to be yours.

02:24.320 --> 02:26.590
Mother Confessor, we
need to keep moving.

02:26.610 --> 02:29.100
Rahl's quads are tracking us.

02:29.920 --> 02:33.050
We've managed to stay ahead of them,
but we can't let our guard down.

02:33.060 --> 02:34.690
We'll escort you to the coast.

02:34.710 --> 02:37.240
Will the other
Confessors meet us there?

02:40.030 --> 02:42.740
There are no other
Confessors,Kahlan.

02:43.190 --> 02:45.870
We are all that's left.

03:01.030 --> 03:04.230
Are you sure leaving the
Midlands is right thing to do?

03:04.240 --> 03:07.150
Isn't it time for Confessors
to stand and fight?

03:08.410 --> 03:10.480
We did.

03:11.280 --> 03:14.370
We made our stand at
the Temple of Rondaxe.

03:17.100 --> 03:20.020
The quads blocked all the doors.

03:20.030 --> 03:22.240
There was no way out.

03:22.260 --> 03:25.870
We fought well, but
there were too many.

03:29.700 --> 03:32.970
Demmin Nass has
begun taking trophies.

03:37.820 --> 03:40.010
I'm so sorry.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.610
I farebetter than most.

03:43.840 --> 03:47.790
Before they could take
my other hand,or worse,

03:49.510 --> 03:51.620
Mother Confessor saved me.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.130
What is it?

04:01.570 --> 04:03.820
Someone's coming.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.140
I guess those quads weren't
as far away as we'd hoped.

04:11.820 --> 04:13.330
Stay where you are!

04:13.810 --> 04:15.540
Wait.

04:16.190 --> 04:17.899
Please,I'm not here to harm you.

04:17.910 --> 04:19.610
Who are you?

04:19.630 --> 04:23.070
My name is Finn. I'm
looking for Dennee.

04:26.170 --> 04:27.930
My sister?

04:30.110 --> 04:31.860
What do you want with her?

04:31.870 --> 04:33.370
I've been searching for months.

04:33.990 --> 04:37.970
A few weeks ago I heard Confessors
were nearby. Please,I have to find her.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.640
She's dead.

04:43.530 --> 04:46.140
My mistress is dead.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.960
Your mistress?

04:51.610 --> 04:55.180
If she's dead, how
will I know what to do?

04:56.150 --> 04:59.580
Kahlan,this man is
still under coession.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.830
How is that possible?

05:00.850 --> 05:02.740
I thought the only way
the spell is broken is--

05:02.750 --> 05:05.410
Is when a Confessor dies.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.350
That means Dennee is still alive.

05:10.040 --> 05:12.420
But when I left her...

05:14.380 --> 05:16.150
Dennee.

05:18.240 --> 05:21.710
Take it. Take the Book.

05:22.400 --> 05:23.760
Find him.

05:23.790 --> 05:25.860
I'm not leaving you.

05:25.880 --> 05:29.830
This is more important
than me. You know that.

05:30.590 --> 05:32.770
Please,Kahlan.

05:36.530 --> 05:40.480
May the Spirits
protect you, little s

05:41.750 --> 05:43.420
Go.

05:59.690 --> 06:03.100
She-- She must have
survived somehow.

06:06.550 --> 06:08.380
Rahl must have her.

06:08.390 --> 06:10.690
We know what he does to Confessors.

06:10.710 --> 06:13.590
Which is why we can't
risk going after her.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.670
What?

06:14.700 --> 06:16.450
Mother Confessor is right.

06:16.470 --> 06:20.460
Kahlan,I loved your sister as if she
were my own, but it could be a trap.

06:20.470 --> 06:24.210
Why would Rahl keep her alive
when he's killed so many others?

06:24.870 --> 06:27.460
I've already left her behind once.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.380
I won't do it again.

06:29.390 --> 06:35.270
I know it's hard, but my duty is to ensure
the survival of the remaining Confessors.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.980
Just as your duty is to protect
the Seeker on his mission.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.580
Right now...

06:43.560 --> 06:46.500
my mission Kahlan's sister.

06:50.230 --> 06:51.870
But Dennee could be anywhere.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.440
Mira could find her.

06:55.040 --> 06:58.490
Dennee was willing to
sacrifice her life for me.

06:58.880 --> 07:01.320
No doubt she'd do the
same for any of you.

07:01.330 --> 07:04.390
How can we not even
try to save her?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.150
We should make camp here.

07:30.880 --> 07:34.830
Kahlan tells me you fought
bravely at the battle of Rondaxe.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.500
Perhaps I can give you back
a little of what you've lost.

08:23.180 --> 08:24.630
I...

08:25.920 --> 08:28.510
I don't believe it.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.390
Thank you.

08:39.429 --> 08:42.169
Still as powerful as I rember.

08:47.140 --> 08:53.520
I'm just sorry I wasn't powerful enough to
stop Darken Rahl before he decimated your order.

09:00.050 --> 09:05.330
When I was just an acolyte, and
you took me under your wing...

09:05.810 --> 09:08.000
Do you rember what you told me?

09:08.030 --> 09:13.080
You said that real power was not
just in the magic that we wield.

09:14.190 --> 09:18.170
It was in our ability to
make difficult choices.

09:18.180 --> 09:24.600
And leaving behind everything and everyone
couldn't have been easy for you,Zeddicus.

09:25.770 --> 09:30.500
But if you hadn't, the
Seeker would not have bee

09:30.520 --> 09:34.260
and there would be no
hope for the Midlands.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.990
I don't understand why Dennee
never told me about you.

09:43.280 --> 09:45.580
How did you come to know my sister?

09:45.590 --> 09:47.670
I tried to kill her.

09:48.340 --> 09:53.030
I was an assassin from the Order of Blood,
and sent by Darken Rahl to murder her.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.400
During the battle, I
was confessed by her.

09:56.420 --> 09:58.660
I haven't seen her in months.

09:58.670 --> 10:02.180
Dennee told me she had to
undertake a delicate mission.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.210
She promised she'd return
to me when it was done.

10:08.010 --> 10:11.600
She would've kept that promise
if I hadn't left her for dead.

10:14.330 --> 10:19.670
Kahlan! Kah-- Hey,hey. We're
going to find her. Okay?

10:26.040 --> 10:29.240
- What's she saying?
- It's Dennee. She's close.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.630
A fortress.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.410
It's not a fortress. It's a prison.

10:38.860 --> 10:41.660
- And Dennee's inside.
- Dennee!

10:42.310 --> 10:45.340
We can't just charge
into a D'Haran prison.

10:47.180 --> 10:49.530
But a Mord-Sith could.

10:50.200 --> 10:54.050
Zedd, Can you do a
little magic tailoring?

11:00.330 --> 11:02.170
Sir.

11:15.320 --> 11:17.790
A Mord-Sith approaches.

11:22.570 --> 11:26.670
Tell your warden I have a
very special prisoner for him.

11:27.900 --> 11:29.940
The Seeker?

11:29.960 --> 11:32.850
You captured him single-handed?

11:34.240 --> 11:37.060
You dare question a Mord-Sith?

11:42.740 --> 11:46.210
Take me to the warden.

11:52.190 --> 11:54.850
I have urgent intelligence
from Lord Rahl.

11:56.850 --> 12:00.230
Intelligence that must
be discussed in private.

12:00.790 --> 12:02.350
Leave us.

12:06.700 --> 12:09.140
So what is this intelligence?

12:17.320 --> 12:19.770
Command me,Confessor.

12:21.580 --> 12:24.970
You have a prisoner I want to see.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.630
Dennee.

12:40.780 --> 12:42.290
Kahlan.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.980
Yes,it's me little sister.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.880
You came for me.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.990
I should have never left you.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.350
This is the Seeker.

12:59.420 --> 13:01.280
Yes.

13:03.410 --> 13:05.780
Then you completed the mission.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.240
I feared you were dead.

13:07.330 --> 13:09.470
Thank the Spirits you're not.

13:09.510 --> 13:10.360
Are you all right?

13:10.410 --> 13:11.620
Did they hurt you?

13:11.690 --> 13:12.880
No.

13:14.810 --> 13:18.220
But they're going to take my baby.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.420
You're with child.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.690
They mean to take
my sister's child.

13:32.470 --> 13:33.380
What do you know about this?

13:33.520 --> 13:36.620
Darken Rahl wants to raise
a Confessor as his own.

13:36.710 --> 13:40.200
To twist the child into a
monster that would do his bidding.

13:42.120 --> 13:43.580
Can you walk?

13:43.690 --> 13:44.990
I think so.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.260
You should hurry.

13:46.260 --> 13:48.700
General Nass rides for
the prison as we speak.

13:51.220 --> 13:52.050
What's going on?

13:52.220 --> 13:53.240
Prisoner transfer.

13:53.470 --> 13:56.090
But my orders are to hold the Confessor
here until General Nass arrives.

13:56.280 --> 13:58.610
Your orders have changed.

14:09.730 --> 14:10.840
Our Dennee is safe.

14:11.090 --> 14:12.680
Dennee!

14:18.580 --> 14:21.200
By the Spirits,you're with child.

14:21.210 --> 14:22.670
Is our baby all right?

14:23.300 --> 14:25.500
Finn is the father?

14:26.570 --> 14:29.950
Mother Confessor,our
numbers were dwindling.

14:30.050 --> 14:31.320
And Finn was already confessed.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.940
So I took him as a mate.

14:32.950 --> 14:34.770
Finn is strong.

14:34.780 --> 14:39.230
And with Rahl hunting Confessors,I could
think of no one better to protect the child.

14:39.250 --> 14:41.010
Joyous news.

14:41.140 --> 14:46.550
Another Confessor will be born
just when we needed her most.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.900
Dennee.

14:48.910 --> 14:52.870
You must've known you were carrying the
baby when we set off for the Boundary.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.430
Why didn't you tell me?

14:55.450 --> 15:01.420
If you knew would you have let me
jn you on such a perilous journey?

15:01.550 --> 15:04.640
No,I wouldn't.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.190
And I couldn't let you go alone.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.310
We need to get moving.

15:12.450 --> 15:15.880
The D'Harans will
be coming after us.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.140
General Nass,we received
orders not to expect you.

15:41.400 --> 15:43.330
What orders?

15:43.420 --> 15:44.610
General.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.890
I have the orders right here.

16:01.390 --> 16:03.110
Where is the prisoner?

16:03.110 --> 16:05.080
B-Being delivered to Rahl.

16:05.170 --> 16:07.270
By whom?

16:07.270 --> 16:08.630
By the Mord-Sith.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.070
She had also captured the Seeker.

16:13.580 --> 16:16.910
That was no Mord-Sith.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.480
It was a Confessor.

16:24.930 --> 16:27.030
Ready your men.

16:27.820 --> 16:35.050
If you can deliver the Confessor-child and the
Seeker to Lord Rahl,he may forgive your failure.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.070
Isn't there a shorter
route to the west?

16:45.150 --> 16:46.820
You smell that?

16:46.840 --> 16:48.550
These are Thelusian pines.

16:48.630 --> 16:51.390
They'll cover any scent from
us the D'Harans might pick up.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.140
We'll be harder to track that way.

16:53.610 --> 16:55.070
Good.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.030
Because we may need to sto

16:59.550 --> 17:00.630
You're doing great!

17:00.730 --> 17:02.620
I just need you to try again.

17:02.670 --> 17:03.620
Come on.

17:03.750 --> 17:05.109
Yes.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.020
Keep breathing.

17:09.829 --> 17:14.050
Dennee,the baby's in
the wrong position.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.710
What?

17:15.730 --> 17:18.180
We need to turn the baby around.

17:19.109 --> 17:20.819
I don't wanna lose my baby.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.060
Your baby's going to be fine.

17:22.089 --> 17:22.990
Let me try.

17:23.060 --> 17:24.040
Have you done this before?

17:24.119 --> 17:25.520
I grew up on a farm,rember?

17:25.670 --> 17:26.829
Okay.

17:31.850 --> 17:33.630
I don't-- I don't
wanna lose her.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.350
Okay,Dennee,try now,push.

18:06.430 --> 18:08.390
It's a boy.

18:17.810 --> 18:20.100
What's wrong?

18:22.150 --> 18:24.710
The child must die.

18:29.470 --> 18:30.930
It's not your fault,Dennee.

18:31.040 --> 18:32.780
It's no one's fault.

18:33.400 --> 18:36.560
There's nothing you could've
done to prevent this.

18:37.230 --> 18:39.210
Kahlan,what's going on?

18:40.860 --> 18:43.650
We're going to need
Kreeg root for the ritual.

18:45.070 --> 18:49.320
Will someone tell me
what's happening here?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.960
Male Confessors can't
be allowed to live.

18:53.020 --> 18:57.450
Their souls must be purified by the Ritual of
the Waters before they pass to the underworld.

18:57.530 --> 18:59.890
Ritual?What are you talking about?

19:00.400 --> 19:03.310
We have to drown the child.

19:03.460 --> 19:04.900
That's insane.

19:05.010 --> 19:09.270
A Confessor giving birth to a
male child is extraordinarily rare.

19:09.370 --> 19:13.730
But if one is born,he cannot be
allowed to grow into adulthood.

19:14.210 --> 19:17.920
Male Confessors are unable
to control their power.

19:17.920 --> 19:22.210
Once they reach manhood they can't
resist using it for wicked ends.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.870
So they are killed at birth.

19:28.890 --> 19:30.640
Your numbers are dwindling

19:30.650 --> 19:35.020
and now you want to kill one of your own
just because you think it might be evil?

19:35.160 --> 19:38.820
Mothers of male Confessors
have often thought as you do.

19:39.790 --> 19:42.880
One foolish young Confessor

19:43.910 --> 19:46.790
couldn't bear to
have her son killed,

19:47.720 --> 19:50.530
so she raised him in secrecy.

19:52.810 --> 19:57.080
She thought that the love in her
heart would be powerful enough

19:57.090 --> 20:01.160
to prevent him from
turning to the dark ways.

20:02.180 --> 20:09.120
But when the boy came of
age,his bloodlust was insatiable.

20:10.900 --> 20:20.320
My child was only 11 years
old when I had to kill him.

20:22.710 --> 20:27.460
Well,just because it happened with your son
doesn't mean it's going to happen with Dennee's.

20:27.560 --> 20:28.450
He's just a baby.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.290
There's still time
to watch him grow.

20:31.490 --> 20:34.470
To know if he's
gonna be evil or not.

20:35.060 --> 20:37.040
Kahlan.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.390
You can't go along with this.

20:41.980 --> 20:45.140
You think this is easy for me?

20:45.150 --> 20:46.790
This is my nephew.

20:49.330 --> 20:56.050
Richar I know that's it's hard for you to
understand,but ancient ways must be honored,

20:56.060 --> 20:58.660
and the longer we allow
this child to live,

20:58.680 --> 21:03.160
the harder it's going to
be to do what must be done.

21:03.270 --> 21:08.930
Doing it now is a less cruel fate
for both the family and the child.

21:09.040 --> 21:13.860
Finn will take the child and
perform the Ritual of the Waters.

21:14.410 --> 21:16.490
Is there no other way?

21:16.610 --> 21:19.200
You know there is not.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.750
Get away from him.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.390
You cannot wish evil away.

21:27.470 --> 21:29.480
You cannot love evil away.

21:29.570 --> 21:31.030
You can only destroy it.

21:31.110 --> 21:33.790
You're not going to hurt this baby.

21:37.790 --> 21:38.750
D'Harans.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.620
Th

21:41.480 --> 21:43.690
We need to move now.

21:44.240 --> 21:45.620
I can get the
D'Harans off our trail.

21:45.730 --> 21:50.230
But you have to promise me nobody
will harm this baby while I'm gone.

22:04.670 --> 22:07.470
Dala oil and Kreeg root.

22:09.080 --> 22:12.050
The Ritual of the Waters.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.310
The Confessor gave birth to a boy.

22:15.890 --> 22:22.820
A female Confessor-child was quite a prize,but
what Lord Rahl wouldn't give for a male Confessor.

22:23.960 --> 22:30.310
And if they are running from us,they
haven't had time yet to perform the ritual.

22:30.410 --> 22:31.460
Sir.

22:31.540 --> 22:32.590
Their tracks lead this way.

22:32.690 --> 22:34.540
Follow them.

22:34.570 --> 22:38.210
We must save that child.

22:43.940 --> 22:45.280
Did you lose them?

22:45.460 --> 22:46.840
They found the tracks I left.

22:46.950 --> 22:48.430
They're heading in
the wrong direction.

22:48.460 --> 22:49.260
Good.

22:49.360 --> 22:50.970
But they're not gonna
give up so easily.

22:51.080 --> 22:52.790
They know it's a boy.

22:52.840 --> 22:55.810
And it seems Rahl really wants to
get his hands on a male Confessor.

22:55.950 --> 22:59.170
It's the darkness
reaching for the darkness.

22:59.180 --> 23:02.230
But he will not have it.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.460
Where's the baby?

23:05.470 --> 23:07.360
Finn's taken him.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.850
You were supposed to keep him safe.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.960
I'm sorry,Richard.

23:12.130 --> 23:16.060
You're right.I
don't.You promised me.

23:17.390 --> 23:20.030
Because I knew you'd do
anything to protect the child.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.780
And so should you.

23:21.790 --> 23:27.060
Richard,letting him live would be a
violation of everything we're taught.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.530
You can't ask me to
go against my beliefs.

23:29.650 --> 23:32.480
And you can't ask me
to go against mine.

23:44.050 --> 23:46.100
Finn,don't.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.800
I can't disobey my mistress.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.570
You ha to do what your
mistress wants,right?

24:08.680 --> 24:10.510
Yes.

24:11.740 --> 24:14.610
She wants me to drown our son.

24:15.960 --> 24:20.200
Are you sure that's
what Dennee wants?

24:20.370 --> 24:24.030
The Mother Confessor
ordered her to do it.

24:25.330 --> 24:29.550
Doesn't your mistress also
command you with her heart?

24:30.180 --> 24:34.910
You heard her when she gave birth.

24:35.740 --> 24:39.280
She didn't want her baby to die.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.940
You know her heart
better than anyone,Finn.

24:44.140 --> 24:46.940
You know what she wants.

24:46.940 --> 24:49.780
She wants her baby...

24:49.900 --> 24:52.100
to live.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.340
I will proct him with my life.

25:29.140 --> 25:31.920
You gave the child to the Seeker?

25:32.040 --> 25:34.420
I thought that's what you'd want.

25:38.840 --> 25:42.290
No,the child is evil and must die.

25:42.990 --> 25:44.850
Then I have failed you.

25:48.090 --> 25:49.260
Which way did the Seeker go?

25:49.420 --> 25:50.070
To the north.

25:50.190 --> 25:50.870
I can get him back.

25:50.890 --> 25:52.540
No.

25:52.590 --> 25:54.400
You' go with Alana.

25:54.410 --> 25:56.620
Take Dennee and the
others to the shore.

25:56.750 --> 26:00.660
The Wizard,Kahlan and I will
continue after the child.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.100
Take Mira as your guide.

26:02.230 --> 26:05.300
We will rejoin you at the
shore once we have the child.

26:06.730 --> 26:11.980
Then we can complete the
ritual and sail to the island.

26:14.410 --> 26:17.290
Mother Confessor,let me
go on to track Richard.

26:17.430 --> 26:20.090
I'll move faster on my own.

26:34.780 --> 26:39.070
Sir,we've lost their trail.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.480
They can't have gotten far.

26:42.700 --> 26:47.860
And for your sake,that child had
better be alive when we find them.

26:51.970 --> 26:53.200
Okay.

26:53.330 --> 26:54.910
It's okay.

26:54.930 --> 26:56.470
We're safe now.

26:56.960 --> 26:58.820
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:02.060 --> 27:04.070
Stay away,Kahlan.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.310
Richard,wait.

27:06.660 --> 27:08.360
What are you planning on doing?

27:08.490 --> 27:10.760
Just keep running with the child?

27:10.870 --> 27:13.560
What your people want
to do is barbaric.

27:14.630 --> 27:16.750
I know it must seem that way,

27:16.760 --> 27:21.350
but you have to understand that boy is a
threat to everything that we're fighting for.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.760
How do you know that if none of
them have been allowed to live?

27:23.900 --> 27:26.040
It's too dangerous to rely on hope.

27:26.150 --> 27:27.290
Hope?

27:27.400 --> 27:30.050
Isn't that what we're fighting for?

27:35.700 --> 27:37.390
Kahlan.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.180
I was a child that was hunted.

27:41.330 --> 27:45.760
Darken Rahl tried to kill me because
of his blind faith in prophecy.

27:45.770 --> 27:49.080
Are you asking me not
to believe in prophecy?

27:49.080 --> 27:52.660
No,I'm asking you to believe in me.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.590
He's hungry.

28:06.950 --> 28:09.050
We need to find some food.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.590
My father used to give this
to me when I was a baby.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.650
There you go.

28:34.540 --> 28:36.390
I thought you might like that.

28:42.420 --> 28:46.240
Richard,what are we
gonna do with him?

28:48.650 --> 28:51.190
Well,I was thinking.

28:51.900 --> 28:54.860
Maybe we can take him
to the Valley of Thandor.

28:55.090 --> 28:59.100
The duty of the Sisters of the Light
is to protect the children at Thandor.

28:59.230 --> 29:02.190
They'd never take
in a male Confessor.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.830
No one will.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.590
We're on our own,Richard.

29:12.930 --> 29:14.870
You're never on your own.

29:15.950 --> 29:17.890
Richard,wait.

29:18.040 --> 29:20.550
We don't need to fight
amongst ourselves.

29:20.590 --> 29:22.830
We have enough enemies already.

29:22.930 --> 29:24.540
This baby isn't one of them.

29:24.550 --> 29:26.450
But he could be.

29:27.520 --> 29:30.120
Darken Rahl was once a child.

29:30.130 --> 29:33.070
Think of all the death
and suffering he's caused.

29:33.200 --> 29:38.110
If you had a chance to
prevent that,wouldn't you?

29:38.120 --> 29:42.390
Inevitably,evil is in its nature.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.000
Well,it's not in mine.

29:44.010 --> 29:46.290
No one is going to hurt this baby.

29:46.410 --> 29:48.220
Enough debate,Zeddicus.

29:48.320 --> 29:51.550
If you can't control
the Seeker,I will.

29:51.560 --> 29:57.090
Is your devotion so great that
you'd threaten to confess the Seeker?

29:57.110 --> 30:01.350
Oh,I have no intention
of confessing him.

30:18.660 --> 30:21.500
Command me,Mother Confessor.

30:25.140 --> 30:26.380
Zedd?

30:26.870 --> 30:28.910
What have you done?

30:29.010 --> 30:31.780
You have betrayed
your order,Kahlan.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.640
Who are you to
question my judgment,

30:35.260 --> 30:39.620
when yours is so obviously impaired
by your feelings for the Seeker?

30:39.660 --> 30:42.800
You would forsake
everything you believe.

30:42.860 --> 30:48.040
Everything you've lived for,for
a man who can never love you.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.240
Zeddicus,get the boy.

31:06.110 --> 31:07.250
Zedd,you can't do this!

31:07.290 --> 31:09.010
You don't want to hurt us.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.670
It's no use,Richard.

31:10.720 --> 31:11.770
He's been confessed.

31:11.830 --> 31:13.880
He's not Zedd anymore.

31:15.850 --> 31:17.730
I don't wanna fight you,Zedd.

31:17.770 --> 31:20.810
And he doesn't want
to fight you,Seeker.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.080
Give me the child and you can
continue with your mission.

31:25.220 --> 31:26.460
The mission?

31:26.550 --> 31:31.050
You jeopardized that when you
confessed a Wizard of the First Order.

31:31.090 --> 31:38.560
As soon as I have the child I will
to continue on as the Seeker's Wizard.

31:38.590 --> 31:41.220
All will be as it was.

31:41.270 --> 31:43.320
No.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.770
Very well.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.090
Make him leave.

31:50.170 --> 31:51.270
Richard!

32:03.410 --> 32:07.020
Mother Confessor,you're
going to kill him!

32:18.030 --> 32:22.560
Kahlan,this has
gone on long enough.

32:29.100 --> 32:32.520
Your mission is to
protect the Seeker.

32:33.090 --> 32:38.370
You know as well as I his life is
more important than the child's.

32:40.540 --> 32:43.200
So give him to me.

32:46.490 --> 32:50.090
It shouldn't be a
difficult decision,Kahlan.

32:50.100 --> 32:53.700
Saving the man you love.

32:54.720 --> 32:56.800
Don't do it,Kahlan.

33:19.510 --> 33:21.770
Kahlan,no.

33:38.060 --> 33:40.600
It's okay,little one.

33:40.610 --> 33:44.110
It'll all be over soon.

34:03.450 --> 34:06.780
I'm sorry I went against your
will by trying to save our child.

34:06.950 --> 34:07.750
I failed you.

34:07.890 --> 34:09.330
No,you didn't fail me.

34:09.449 --> 34:10.650
You were doing my will.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.600
Dennee,you can't put
such ideas in his head.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.280
Why not?

34:14.449 --> 34:16.610
Mother Confessor knows
what must be done.

34:16.620 --> 34:18.530
We cannot defy her.

34:18.540 --> 34:21.620
Would you feel the sam
if it were your child?

34:21.710 --> 34:25.480
It has been done this
way for thousands of yea.

34:25.580 --> 34:27.929
There are only six of us left.

34:27.949 --> 34:31.050
Do the ancient ways
still make sense?

34:34.980 --> 34:37.010
I'm so sorry,chard.

34:37.090 --> 34:39.860
But I couldn't let them hurt you.

34:41.429 --> 34:43.340
It's not your fault.

34:43.420 --> 34:47.790
With Zedd confessed and
the Sword of Truth gone...

34:48.929 --> 34:51.340
It's hopeless.

34:53.409 --> 34:55.820
There's always hope.

34:58.590 --> 35:00.760
We're too late,aren't we?

35:00.770 --> 35:05.150
Mother Confessor has taken the
child to the shore to drown him.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.350
Can we catch her in time?

35:06.430 --> 35:09.660
She's confessed Zedd.

35:09.680 --> 35:12.350
And taken the Sword of Truth.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.150
What are we gonna do?

35:16.230 --> 35:18.180
We're going to get some help.

35:18.260 --> 35:19.800
The tracks end here.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.850
Where did he go?

35:21.920 --> 35:24.230
I'm right here.

35:24.350 --> 35:26.540
I'm unarmed.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.330
Then you are a fool.

37:01.090 --> 37:03.400
Kahlan,now!

37:19.300 --> 37:22.260
Command me,Confessor.

37:31.040 --> 37:32.900
What is it,Mother Confessor?

37:32.920 --> 37:34.030
The others.

37:34.130 --> 37:35.900
They should already be here.

37:36.840 --> 37:38.710
Someone's coming.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.700
Stop them.

38:37.900 --> 38:42.770
You'll never know how greatly
you've disappointed me,Kahlan.

38:42.830 --> 38:47.270
I always thought that one day
you would be Mother Confessor.

38:48.100 --> 38:50.500
How wrong I was.

38:50.970 --> 38:57.610
You were taught all your life to know
the difference between right and wrong.

38:58.110 --> 39:00.360
This child...

39:00.470 --> 39:04.340
could destroy everything
we've been fighting for.

39:05.110 --> 39:08.010
No,we're fighting for a
world with less brutality.

39:08.090 --> 39:11.070
Would killing that
child give us that?

39:12.390 --> 39:13.960
Yes.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.490
No!

39:34.300 --> 39:35.960
Zedd?

39:38.910 --> 39:39.880
Zedd.

39:39.970 --> 39:41.280
Zedd!

39:41.720 --> 39:43.360
Richard.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.400
I'm just glad I didn't hurt you.

39:52.190 --> 39:57.150
KA She dedicated her life to keeping the
Midlands free from the tyranny of Darken Rahl.

39:57.850 --> 40:00.730
For that she will be rembered.

40:00.800 --> 40:05.770
Spirits,watch over her as
she has watched over so many.

40:17.060 --> 40:20.460
We need to choose
a Mother Confessor.

40:23.330 --> 40:25.750
We already have.

40:26.890 --> 40:29.210
It's you,Kahlan.

40:32.510 --> 40:36.710
I'm-- I'm
honored but...

40:36.800 --> 40:39.990
I must continue to
protect the Seeker.

40:40.080 --> 40:45.870
Just as we must stay in the Midlands
torotect the people from Rahl's injustice.

40:50.620 --> 40:52.820
Take Mira.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.820
She will keep you safe.

41:16.590 --> 41:19.440
Thank you for coming back for me.

41:21.310 --> 41:26.510
I asked the Spirits to
protect you,and they did.

42:04.960 --> 42:07.050
They'll be fine.

42:07.440 --> 42:09.520
You said it yourself.

42:09.590 --> 42:14.740
Dennee and Finn can't be confessed,so
their son's touch will have no effect.

42:14.810 --> 42:18.350
He can't be seduced by his own
power if he's unable to use it.

42:18.410 --> 42:22.870
Once they reach Valeria,there
won't be anyone to corrupt.

42:23.600 --> 42:29.150
With no one to corrupt him,they can
raise him to be a force for good.

42:30.120 --> 42:32.640
But what if we're wrong?

42:32.810 --> 42:37.540
What if we've unleashed a
horrible evil into the world?

42:38.480 --> 42:39.910
What then?

42:40.810 --> 42:43.770
