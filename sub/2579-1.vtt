21:35.378 --> 21:39.132
I know what you mean. It's a little crazy.
You think it's kind of a joke, right?

21:39.507 --> 21:42.468
I just don't want you to get hurt. That's all.

21:48.099 --> 21:49.392
That's good.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.561
Nice seeing you.

21:54.439 --> 21:56.816
How many alcoholic beverages
do you consume?

21:56.983 --> 21:58.901
Normal. Five, maybe six.

21:59.402 --> 22:02.238
- A week?
- Well, maybe a little more than normal.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.746
Ah! Oh, baby Jesus.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.456
It feels normal.

22:11.956 --> 22:13.583
To you, maybe.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.503
Ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-ma.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.923
MAN: There they are.
DANTE: Hey! Ha, ha.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.259
Just like I said. Paragons of health, huh?

22:23.426 --> 22:25.053
KID:
Passed with flying colors.

22:25.928 --> 22:27.430
Clean bill of health.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.057
DANTE:
Not quite "with flying colors."

22:29.223 --> 22:31.601
But it's our paintbrushes
that we painting with.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.937
So look, I'm gonna introduce you
to a guy that's making this happen.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.566
- Lou Camare, our promoter.
- I would've met you at the press conference...

22:38.733 --> 22:42.278
...but Junior begged me to let him
go in front of the cameras by himself.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.572
This face needs solo exposure.
You know that.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.949
You know, my brother's
the doctor who saw you.

22:47.116 --> 22:48.951
And my other brother,
he's the commissioner.

22:49.118 --> 22:52.288
I can get a dogfight sanctioned if I needed to.
This one was tricky.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.665
Are you saying that I can bring
my dog here too?

22:54.832 --> 22:58.086
That's not what he said.
Why do I feel like there's something coming?

22:58.252 --> 23:00.713
DANTE: Here's the thing.
The conference didn't go as planned.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.091
We gotta sell 5000 tickets, baby.
Five thousand.

23:03.257 --> 23:04.926
So I'm gonna need help promoting it.

23:05.093 --> 23:08.096
Not individuals, both of you.
Together. As a group, okay?

23:08.262 --> 23:11.015
I could never spend
more than three minutes with this burn...

23:11.182 --> 23:14.602
...unless I was beating the brains out of him.
KID: He's got it backwards.

23:14.769 --> 23:16.646
He's punch-drunk.
I was smacking him around.

23:16.813 --> 23:18.898
I smacked him from ring post to ring post.

23:19.065 --> 23:22.485
A little too much of this in the head.
Little too much.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.654
- When's the fight?
- Boom.

23:24.821 --> 23:28.658
Hey, listen. Bottom line is this:
If we don't sell tickets, we don't make money.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.119
- No tickets, no money.
-"No tickets, no money." I'm in.

23:31.285 --> 23:35.498
- That's my guy. No ticket, no money.
- No tickets, no money. No money, no fight.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.333
No ticket, no money.

23:37.500 --> 23:40.837
No fight, no money, no tickets.
Either way you put it, all three ways:

23:41.003 --> 23:43.756
No tickets, no fight, no money.
No money, no fight, no tickets.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.008
No fight, no money, no tickets.
What's the third one?

23:46.175 --> 23:47.844
- All three ways.
RAZOR: You got it covered.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.053
What's your problem?

23:49.220 --> 23:52.181
You gonna fight, fight.
You're not gonna fight, don't fight.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.142
You fight,
you have to do these things.

23:54.308 --> 23:57.687
DANTE: The point that I'm making,
in order to do it, we gotta do it together.

23:57.854 --> 23:59.856
Yeah, together. Okay.

24:00.731 --> 24:03.651
<i>ANNOUNCER:
It's show time at the Miroquois Casino.</i>

24:03.818 --> 24:07.155
<i>Slots, entertainment and the best buffet
on the Monongahela River!</i>

24:07.321 --> 24:08.489
<i>Just ask these two.</i>

24:08.656 --> 24:11.701
Whoa, will you get a load
of that hunk of meat?

24:11.868 --> 24:16.497
Hey, watch your mouth, Billy "The Kid"
McDonnen, onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

24:16.664 --> 24:19.876
I'm right over here.
Right over by the delicious prime rib.

24:20.209 --> 24:23.880
Sorry, Henry "Razor" Sharp,
onetime Light Heavyweight Champ.

24:24.046 --> 24:28.718
I didn't hear you as I am distracted
by this mouth-watering chicken breast.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.554
If you got a gambling problem,
if you're a degenerate...

24:31.721 --> 24:34.390
...I wouldn't come down here
because gambling is a cancer.

24:34.557 --> 24:37.393
Cut! Please just follow the script, Razor.

24:37.560 --> 24:38.686
It's not that.

24:38.853 --> 24:42.398
The pictures make this look glamorous
but it could be a problem for people...

24:42.565 --> 24:44.358
...and I'm saying it should be known.

24:44.525 --> 24:47.361
What is this, improv night at Chuckles?
Come on, say the words.

24:47.528 --> 24:50.031
Well, maybe I just happened
to hit a sore spot, huh?

24:50.198 --> 24:53.034
Didn't you lose 200 grand betting
the Buffalo Bills?

24:53.201 --> 24:56.537
- Who loses the Super Bowl four times in a row?
- I don't know. You.

24:56.704 --> 24:59.582
- I thought they'd win once.
- Maybe you got a talent for losing.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.251
- I got a talent for busting your--
DANTE: Hey, hey!

25:02.418 --> 25:04.837
KID: You're getting personal.
RAZOR: I'm standing here.

25:05.004 --> 25:06.923
<i>RAZOR:
I'm gonna put that shit right up your ass!</i>

25:07.089 --> 25:09.342
Heh. No such thing as bad publicity.

25:09.509 --> 25:12.178
<i>NEWSMAN [ON TV]: Those two ex-fighters
are making news again...</i>

25:12.345 --> 25:14.597
...and <i>are trending on Twitter.
We'll have that--</i>

25:14.764 --> 25:17.141
- What a lot of crap.
- What's the matter?

25:17.308 --> 25:21.395
You gotta fight in 12 weeks, you're doing
stupid publicity stunts. Who's training you?

25:22.605 --> 25:24.774
Well, here's a hint: Somebody I can trust.

25:24.941 --> 25:27.068
Well, that's easy,
because you don't trust nobody.

25:27.235 --> 25:29.111
- I trust you.
- Ha, ha.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.906
Forget it. I'm a dinosaur.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.992
Come on, we did pretty good
for 13 years together.

25:35.159 --> 25:38.955
In case you haven't noticed, I can hardly
take care of myself. I'm like an infant baby.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.623
Except I got three white pubic hairs.

25:41.123 --> 25:43.125
Heh. You can do this.

25:43.292 --> 25:46.462
I haven't got time.
I gotta find myself a place to stay.

25:46.629 --> 25:48.923
You can stay with me
until I find you a new place.

25:49.090 --> 25:51.884
No. Don't spend any more money on me.
I'm almost done.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.803
It's like polishing a turd.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.306
Do you remember the first time
I came to the gym?

25:57.974 --> 26:00.810
Do you remember what you said to me?
I do.

26:01.644 --> 26:04.647
I said, "it looks like the garbage man
forgot to take out the trash."

26:04.814 --> 26:06.899
Heh. Yeah. Something cheerful like that.

26:07.275 --> 26:08.651
Then you said:

26:08.818 --> 26:11.320
"if I take you on, kid, you're stuck with me."

26:11.487 --> 26:12.822
You said that.

26:12.989 --> 26:15.449
Don't quit on me, Light.
I won't quit on you.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.828
Oh, here we go.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.538
Call it.

26:21.998 --> 26:23.165
It's a quarter.

26:23.332 --> 26:26.252
Come on. Light, I need your help.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.671
It'd be fun. One last time.

26:30.006 --> 26:32.508
You know why I said what I did
about the garbage?

26:32.675 --> 26:33.676
No.

26:35.219 --> 26:39.181
I didn't want your head to get swelled up.
You were so goddamn good.

26:44.228 --> 26:45.605
Thanks,buddy.

26:45.771 --> 26:47.440
- Raze?
- Hmm?

26:47.607 --> 26:49.358
Give me my quarter back.

26:50.359 --> 26:51.694
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.530
How can you be so cheap?

26:54.697 --> 26:57.158
I haven't got any money.
Give me my damn quarter.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.534
Okay. Fine.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.721
Nice car.

27:26.729 --> 27:31.192
Oh, wow! This is exciting. Look who's here
to meet me. Kid McDonnen.

27:31.359 --> 27:34.028
You know him from the Internet.
"Two old guys fighting."

27:34.195 --> 27:37.740
He used to be Light Heavyweight Champ.
Wow, you put on a couple pounds?

27:37.907 --> 27:39.700
- You're gonna get me in shape.
- Oh, really?

27:39.867 --> 27:40.910
He's gonna get me in shape.

27:41.077 --> 27:43.037
- Give us a couple minutes.
KID: They can come.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.872
Watch a real reality show.

27:45.039 --> 27:47.375
- Watch us negotiate.
- Okay. Okay! Ha, ha.

27:47.541 --> 27:50.002
Hey! Ho-ho! All right.

27:50.294 --> 27:52.797
- Let's get real, Kid.
- Okay, let's get real.

27:52.963 --> 27:54.674
Me training you, it ain't happening.

27:56.759 --> 28:00.721
Well, this might be a problem,
because I already made the announcement.

28:00.888 --> 28:02.932
You, my friend, are embarrassing yourself.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.434
A great performer knows
when it's time to get off the stage.

28:05.601 --> 28:09.689
- What? Foreman fought when he was old.
- He was 15 years younger than you.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.273
Listen, you know what I'm gonna do?

28:11.440 --> 28:14.944
I'll go down there and fight
any one of those fighters, the best one.

28:15.111 --> 28:19.573
And then if you see
that I don't have what you want, I'll walk away.

28:19.949 --> 28:21.242
It's over.

28:21.409 --> 28:22.785
Where's your dignity?

28:22.952 --> 28:26.163
You're in my office, begging me
for a comeback you don't deserve?

28:26.330 --> 28:28.791
- Well, take your best shot now.
- Whoa, Kid.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.251
What are you flexing for?

28:30.418 --> 28:32.628
Don't try it. I'm warning you.
I'll lay you out.

28:32.795 --> 28:34.755
- Don't worry, I won't.
- All right.

28:34.922 --> 28:36.465
Oh. Come on, Kid.

28:36.632 --> 28:39.427
- What?
- I saw your fist clench 10 seconds ago.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.221
I saw your eyes dart at my gut
five seconds ago.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.806
You're an old man. You're washed up.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.809
- Ooh!
- Did you see that five seconds ago?

28:46.976 --> 28:49.395
Huh? Huh? What? My eyes darted there first.

28:49.812 --> 28:53.858
I can't believe you.
After what I did for your father, your family...

28:54.024 --> 28:56.110
...how you ever could say no to me.

28:56.277 --> 28:58.487
You wouldn't have all this if it wasn't for me.

28:58.654 --> 29:01.282
You wouldn't have this gym
if it weren't for me.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.451
I don't understand.

29:05.286 --> 29:09.081
You mention my father. That's a low blow.
I respect what you did for my family.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.625
- What are you gonna do?
- Okay, I'll let you train here.

29:11.792 --> 29:15.004
- Good.
<i>- I'll</i> even get some of my guys to help you out.

29:15.171 --> 29:17.590
But you and I both know
I won't be doing jack.

29:17.757 --> 29:19.341
Okay. Thanks.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.635
- Long as we're clear.
- Yeah, all right.

29:21.802 --> 29:24.513
See? You got me moving faster already.

29:29.560 --> 29:31.312
Hey. You again?

29:31.479 --> 29:35.149
- Think I can talk to you for a second?
- Why do you keep following me around?

29:35.316 --> 29:38.569
My name's BJ. I'm your son, Kid.

29:44.492 --> 29:46.285
We should get some coffee.

29:46.869 --> 29:48.287
Yeah, I'd like that.

30:02.009 --> 30:04.428
Excuse me, can I just
ask you something real quick?

30:04.595 --> 30:06.889
- You're in training, right?
- Uh-huh.

30:07.056 --> 30:09.391
What are you training for?
A pie-eating contest? Heh.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.393
That's all carbs.

30:12.228 --> 30:15.439
That's good. Maple syrup. It's healthy.

30:17.066 --> 30:18.400
Some Scotch?

30:23.656 --> 30:27.243
- So when did your mother tell you about me?
- Just last week.

30:27.409 --> 30:30.913
Gotta tell you, if you weren't all over the news,
I don't think she would've.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.082
So how is she?

30:33.958 --> 30:35.918
Well, she's, uh...

30:36.335 --> 30:38.254
She's emotional, you know?

30:38.420 --> 30:43.759
My dad. Her husband, the guy who raised me,
he passed away recently so...

30:44.093 --> 30:46.595
- Ah. Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.430
- Was he good to you?
- Oh, yeah.

30:48.597 --> 30:50.099
Yeah, he was the best.

30:52.601 --> 30:53.978
So.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.730
What'd she say about me?

30:57.857 --> 31:00.234
That you were pretty much the worst.

31:00.401 --> 31:01.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.696
Anything specific?

31:03.863 --> 31:06.323
More specifically. All right. All right.

31:06.490 --> 31:09.285
She, um-- She said
you turned into an asshole.

31:09.451 --> 31:10.911
Heh, that's what she said.

31:11.078 --> 31:16.250
She said you became a womanizer
and a drunk. Loudmouth, you know?

31:16.417 --> 31:17.793
- Is that all?
- That's it.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.421
- That's bullshit.
- Ha, ha.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.965
Well, I was all those things
way before I met your mother.

31:23.132 --> 31:27.261
Yeah, she wasn't too happy
about me coming to see you today so...

31:28.137 --> 31:29.889
Yeah. Well...

31:33.893 --> 31:36.395
Well, why did you?

31:39.982 --> 31:41.692
Guess I was curious.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.278
You were never curious about me?

31:44.653 --> 31:48.449
Your mother asked me to not make any
contact with you so I respected that.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.242
You respected that, but...

31:50.409 --> 31:52.328
You did know you had a son, right?

31:52.494 --> 31:55.915
I wasn't ready to be a dad
and your mother got pregnant accidentally.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.668
You had me and I was a mistake
you didn't want to deal with, right?

31:59.835 --> 32:03.005
- I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay, I get it.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.841
- Don't take it like that.
- I'm not taking it any way.

32:06.008 --> 32:10.471
You're not a mistake. You're here.
The situation was a mistake. I don't know.

32:10.638 --> 32:12.765
It's okay. You don't owe me nothing.
Take that.

32:12.932 --> 32:15.768
- Put that towards your double bypass.
- What's all this about?

32:15.935 --> 32:18.354
When I came here today,
I was pissed off at my mom...

32:18.520 --> 32:22.316
...because she kept you a secret from me,
but I think I get why she did it.

32:23.567 --> 32:24.735
Good luck.

32:38.791 --> 32:39.833
RAZOR:
Home, sweet home.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.836
LIGHTNING:
It's exactly the same as it was 20 years ago.

32:44.213 --> 32:45.297
What's that?

32:45.464 --> 32:48.384
It's my hobby. I got a creative side.
Didn't know that, did you?
