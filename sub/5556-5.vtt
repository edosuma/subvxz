Clara, I'm under attack
from four and a bit

in case you think I'm slacking.

00:20.440 --> 00:23.039
Doctor, I think there's
something in my spacesuit.

00:23.800 --> 00:24.879
That's... That's possible, actually.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.439
You were too long in the spider mines.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.759
CLARA: Okay, explain.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.199

through your mouth, hence the name.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.159
-It's halfway up my leg.
-Don't worry, it's just hungry.

00:34.560 --> 00:35.599
CLARA: Doctor...

00:35.680 --> 00:38.479
DOCTOR: Describe the four
most interesting stars you can see.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.399
There's a blue one. Quite big.

00:40.480 --> 00:41.759
Two little yellowish ones just below.

00:41.840 --> 00:43.119
Colour of whisky, smaller one blinking?

00:43.360 --> 00:45.359
Yes. It's in the back of my neck.
I can feel it.

00:45.440 --> 00:47.679
Great!
So asphyxiation would kill you first.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.359
Can you see a nebula?

00:49.440 --> 00:51.919
Can you see a nebula
in a sort of wing-shape,

-Yes. Yes, I can.

00:55.680 --> 00:57.919
I've seen it, too.
I wonder where it was.

my spot-on materialization skills.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.759
What about all the Philosians?
Are they safe?

01:19.840 --> 01:20.919
Huh?

01:22.360 --> 01:23.479
Oh, yeah.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.119
Well, I lured their attackers
halfway across the universe

01:27.200 --> 01:28.519
and drained their weapons banks.

01:28.600 --> 01:31.319
Not to mention,
I also saved a school teacher

13:34.760 --> 13:37.639
Ten of my warriors
versus the best of your village.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.679
-You will beg for mercy.
-(LAUGHS)

13:40.120 --> 13:42.359
I will send you back.

13:42.560 --> 13:47.439
You can inform your people
of their impending destruction.

13:47.520 --> 13:50.159
-CLARA: Why are you doing this?
-Why else?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.999
The joy of war.

13:53.840 --> 13:57.119
Can't you see it on my face?

13:58.600 --> 13:59.799
(BEEPS)

14:11.920 --> 14:12.919
(GRUNTS)

14:15.280 --> 14:16.879
-Clara.
-My child.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.959
Clara! Clara!

14:24.880 --> 14:26.359
I'm not a hugger.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.639
-Ah. This is...
-Oh! No.

14:29.960 --> 14:31.439
Where are the others?

14:33.680 --> 14:34.679
I'm sorry, Father.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.599
I looked them up
at my 2,000 year diary.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.199
-They are called the Mire.
-Okay, Listen.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.719
They are one of the deadliest
warrior races in the entire galaxy.

14:40.800 --> 14:41.919
-Okay.
-But they are practical.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.119
They get what they want
and then they go.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.599
You persuaded them to go, didn't you?
I knew that you would.

14:45.680 --> 14:46.839
The deadliest warrior race
in the galaxy?

14:46.920 --> 14:48.719
One of them. Yes, why?

14:49.400 --> 14:51.639
Because I think this village
just declared war on them.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.279
They're coming here tomorrow,
1 0 of them,

14:57.360 --> 14:58.879
to kill everybody in the village.

15:00.080 --> 15:02.399
Ashildr, is this true?

15:03.160 --> 15:04.359
It's my fault.

15:04.480 --> 15:08.199
Not every misfortune that befalls
this village is down to you.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.399
She thinks she brings us bad luck.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.159
What bad luck?
You haven't had any bad luck.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.239
You're fine.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.799
-We're about to be attacked by...
-DOCTOR: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

15:16.880 --> 15:19.199
With a whole day to spare.

15:19.600 --> 15:20.919
So, leave.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.599
Hop it. Take off.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.559
Into the woods, split up, hide.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.439
Hang about there for a week,
come back home.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.839
Make puddings and babies.
That's basically what you do, isn't it?

15:30.640 --> 15:32.279
We cannot leave this village.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.079
Yes, you can.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.999
Just pick a direction.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.519
Fly like a bird, run like a nose.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.399
It's probably a Vikings' saying,
I haven't checked that.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.919
No. We will fight.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.759
(VIKINGS AGREEING)

15:47.560 --> 15:48.839
Well, I don't know if you remember,

15:48.920 --> 15:51.559
but they actually took away
all your fighters.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.119
So, uh, what are you?

15:53.600 --> 15:55.679
Farmers, fishermen,

15:55.880 --> 15:58.679
web designers. Maybe not that last one.

16:06.280 --> 16:07.279
Okay. (CLAPS)

16:08.720 --> 16:09.919
Tell me this.

16:10.000 --> 16:15.079
How many people here
have actually held a sword in battle?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.559
By show of hands.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.959
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, baby.

16:38.840 --> 16:44.159
The Mire are coming
for each and every one of you.

-(SWORD CLANKING)
-So, what're you gonna do?

16:46.560 --> 16:47.679
Raise crops at them?

16:47.760 --> 16:49.359
If necessary.

16:49.440 --> 16:50.959
I think he was being sarcastic.

16:51.040 --> 16:53.519
We're not cowards. We do not run.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.279
And a death in battle
is a death with honour.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.359
ALL: Aye.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.879
(BABY CRYING)

17:03.760 --> 17:05.959

17:12.920 --> 17:15.759
I am afraid, Mother.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.039
Hold me, Mother.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.479
I'm afraid.

towards me, Mother, for you're...

You're beautiful...

17:33.640 --> 17:35.519
(BABY CONTINUES CRYING)

17:35.600 --> 17:37.599
And I will sing for you.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.599
I'm afraid,

17:42.120 --> 17:43.679
but I will sing.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.959
Babies think that laughter is singing,
did you know that?

17:49.000 --> 17:52.719
I applaud your courage,
but I deplore your stupidity.

17:53.480 --> 17:56.399
And I will mourn your deaths,
which will be terrifying,

17:57.400 --> 18:01.039
painful and without honour.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.439
Stay.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.919
You could help us. I know you could.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.799
I told you to run.

18:14.880 --> 18:16.399
That's all the help you need.

18:19.160 --> 18:20.919
That's all the help you're getting.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.519
The Earth is safe,
humanity is not in danger.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.079
It's just one village.

18:42.520 --> 18:43.719
Just one village?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.279
Suppose I saved it, by some miracle,

18:46.360 --> 18:48.239
no TARDIS, no sonic...

18:49.240 --> 18:51.719
Just one village defeats the Mire.

18:53.240 --> 18:54.599
What then?

18:55.080 --> 18:56.999
Word gets around,

18:57.080 --> 18:59.399
Earth becomes a target
of strategic value

18:59.480 --> 19:01.399
and the Mire come back.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.359
And God knows what else.

19:09.200 --> 19:10.959
until everybody dies.

-She.

Babies sense danger. They have to.

19:27.480 --> 19:28.759
Tell me.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.879
Mother, I hear thunder.
Mother, I hear shouting.

19:34.960 --> 19:37.679
You're my world,
but I hear other worlds now.

19:45.400 --> 19:46.999

19:47.720 --> 19:49.719
...is that other kindness.

20:19.240 --> 20:20.799
The baby stopped crying.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.679
So, when I say "Move," you move.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.919
When I say, "Jump," you say, "How high?"

20:35.320 --> 20:36.679
Unless, of course,
there's a gap of some kind

20:36.760 --> 20:38.919
which, of course, means
you jump horizontally.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.439
Yes, what is it, Lofty?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.319
Sir, my name's not actually "Lofty."
It's Br...

20:44.400 --> 20:45.639
No, it's not. It's Lofty.

20:45.720 --> 20:46.919
I've got too much to think about

20:47.000 --> 20:48.319
without everybody
having their own names.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.079
So, it's Lofty.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.079
You're Lofty, you're Daphne.

So, we'll try that again.

Lofty?

21:05.520 --> 21:07.719
-What is it?
-Sorry, sir. It's just...

21:07.800 --> 21:09.919
Why aren't we practising
with real swords?

21:10.000 --> 21:13.199
Yes, perhaps, you'd like
to field this one, Limpy.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.479
Because we can't be trusted with them.

21:16.560 --> 21:18.279
That's right. Yes.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.999
You'll be given your real swords back

21:20.080 --> 21:22.279
when you can prove
that you can wave them around

21:22.640 --> 21:24.159
without lopping bits off yourself.

Why are your eyes closed?

21:26.680 --> 21:29.039
Sorry, sir, just not that good
with the sight of blood.

21:31.240 --> 21:33.359
No, of course you're not.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.399
Swords against those creatures...

21:36.680 --> 21:38.439

21:40.200 --> 21:42.159
He hasn't got a plan, yet,

21:42.640 --> 21:44.359
but he will have.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.759
on his helmet with a sword,

22:18.840 --> 22:20.319
which knocked him out,
there was a little blood,

22:20.400 --> 22:23.119
which you saw, and did that.

22:24.280 --> 22:25.599
Only the first time, you did it,

22:25.680 --> 22:27.839
you knocked a torch into some hay,
which spooked a horse

22:27.920 --> 22:31.759
who kicked open the gate, and I'm sure
that you can fill in the rest.

Weird sounding thunder.

-Well...

not just the sight any more.

He's actually upgraded his phobia.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.799
Chuckles...

23:14.280 --> 23:16.439
He questions every single order
you give him,

23:16.520 --> 23:17.639
which is gonna be a little...

23:17.720 --> 23:18.759
A little bit difficult,

23:18.840 --> 23:19.959
a little bit tricky
in the heat of battle.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.719
I keep waiting to hear
what your real plan is.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.599

that's the only plan I've got.

It doesn't matter
how well you train them,

23:41.320 --> 23:42.359
it's not gonna make a difference.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.039
They'll die fighting, with honour.

that's all the difference in the world.

24:25.960 --> 24:26.999
Well, stop thinking about me.

And start thinking about them,
because you're missing something.

-What?
-How're you gonna win?

24:31.400 --> 24:33.399

right up until the last minute.

So, put down your sword,
stop playing soldier, and

24:36.280 --> 24:37.359
look for it.

When the raiding parties go out,
I make up stories about their battles.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.839
Because if you make up the right story,

25:10.920 --> 25:13.319
you think it will keep them safe
and they'll all come home.

25:14.200 --> 25:15.719
That's okay.

25:15.800 --> 25:18.119
You're not the first person
to ever have done that.

By this time tomorrow,
every single one of us will be dead.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.359

would be death itself.

-Where is he taking her?
-ASHILDR: The boathouse.

27:31.960 --> 27:34.119
He takes her to the boathouse
when she won't settle.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.879
She likes the fish.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.319
Why would she?

28:04.240 --> 28:05.279
Hello, baby.

28:05.360 --> 28:06.599
I had no idea this was
your junior parent.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.279
I'm trying to settle her.
She likes all the fish.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.039
Okay, you're shouting. What's happened?

28:10.120 --> 28:11.239
You trapped your finger
in something again?

28:11.320 --> 28:13.279
Chuckles, bedtime is cancelled.
Everybody off the hard stuff.

28:13.360 --> 28:14.839
We have a long night's work ahead of us.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.799
I'm gonna need a blacksmith.
Who's the blacksmith?

28:16.880 --> 28:17.919
I'm the blacksmith.

28:18.000 --> 28:19.679
What? Are you the blacksmith?
And you got a baby, too.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.079
-He's been at it hammer and tongs.
-Doctor, explain. What's happening?

28:22.160 --> 28:24.319
There's gonna be a war tomorrow.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.679
And here's some news, this just in.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.159
We're gonna win the hell out of it.

28:30.520 --> 28:33.319
-How?
-Ashildr, this is your village,

28:33.400 --> 28:35.999
and you will never have to leave it.
I swear.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.119
Seriously, how?

28:37.200 --> 28:40.439
I told you
that we were basically doomed.

28:40.520 --> 28:45.999
Did no one in this two-horn town
think to mention that you had eels?

28:47.400 --> 28:50.999
-Eels?
-I give you fire in the water.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.279
Electric eels.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.399
Yes. Yes.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.759
I know exactly how you feel.

28:57.840 --> 28:58.879
Well, not exactly.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.039
She needs changing.

29:02.600 --> 29:06.639
-Plan, then?
-And it is a doozy.

29:07.400 --> 29:10.359
We need to pull that silvery stuff
out of Clara's spacesuit.

29:10.440 --> 29:13.439
We can use it
to magnify the electrical charge.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.239
And stop looking confused, look happy!

29:16.320 --> 29:18.999
Winning is all about
looking happier than the other guy.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.919
Always walk briskly,
it makes you a moving target.

29:24.000 --> 29:25.599
Uh... Oh, that's for Lofty! Lofty!

29:26.960 --> 29:28.519
And talk with confidence.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.839
Even if you are terrified.

29:29.920 --> 29:31.559
Act as if you know their plan,

29:31.640 --> 29:33.679
and sometimes,
if you are very lucky,

29:33.760 --> 29:35.479
they'll actually tell you it.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.319
Ah. This is for Ashildr.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.799
Then, we deploy the anvil.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.639
Now, at this stage,
getting one of their helmets is key.

29:43.720 --> 29:46.199
We get a helmet
and this is over.

29:46.280 --> 29:49.799
Then we can mop up the rest
using Ashildr's monstrosity.

29:57.560 --> 29:59.759

38:54.200 --> 38:56.359
CLARA: Doctor?
What's wrong with your face?

38:57.320 --> 38:58.679
I think I know why I chose it.

39:00.040 --> 39:01.319
It's like I'm trying
to tell myself something.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.319
I think I know what I'm trying to say.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.559
Just someone,
not the whole town.

39:09.320 --> 39:10.359
Just save someone.

39:12.360 --> 39:13.479
Come with me...

39:16.040 --> 39:18.919
I know where I got this face
and I know what it is for.

39:19.560 --> 39:20.599
Okay, what's it for?

39:21.000 --> 39:25.319
To remind me,
to hold me to the mark.

39:26.440 --> 39:29.559
I'm the Doctor, and I save people.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.999
And if anyone happens to be listening,

39:32.080 --> 39:34.439
anyone have a kind of
a problem with that,

39:35.320 --> 39:36.999
to hell with you!

39:39.480 --> 39:40.519
(GRUNTS)

39:45.160 --> 39:46.439
What's he doing?

39:47.120 --> 39:49.079
Saving her, I think.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.639
(WHOOSHING)

39:54.920 --> 39:56.759
It's from the Mire helmet,
battlefield medical kit.

39:57.560 --> 39:59.239
I've reprogrammed it for human beings.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.919
It's gone. It's inside her.

40:11.400 --> 40:12.919
It's repairing her.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.559
It won't ever stop repairing her,
if it works.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.319
Come on, Ashildr.

40:17.640 --> 40:20.239
Come on. The story's not over yet.

40:23.280 --> 40:24.679
Daughter...

40:25.560 --> 40:27.719
(SNIFFLES) Listen to me.

40:28.360 --> 40:30.999
This town has lost so much.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.759
If we lose you, too,

40:36.720 --> 40:37.799
there'll be nothing left.

40:54.320 --> 40:55.399
(GASPS)

40:58.360 --> 40:59.479
-(WHEEZING)
-Ashildr.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.639
She'll be conscious in a day.

41:02.920 --> 41:04.879
Up and about in three.
No swimming for a week.

41:05.160 --> 41:08.359
Now, we going to need a long boat
and some of your best rowers.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.799
We're two days sail from the TARDIS.
Come on, Clara!

41:10.920 --> 41:12.839
No, wait, no.
She'll want to see you when she wakes.

41:12.920 --> 41:16.439
Oh, no. Well, she'll see me
often enough once she understands.

41:16.520 --> 41:17.799
Understands what?

41:19.920 --> 41:20.999
Second dose.

41:22.520 --> 41:23.719
-When she needs to take this?
-No, no, no.

41:23.800 --> 41:24.839
It's not for her.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.559
-Then who is it for?
-Ah, whoever she wants.

41:28.560 --> 41:29.959
ASHILDR: Doctor...

41:31.440 --> 41:33.359
-Thank you.
-DOCTOR: Ah...

41:34.280 --> 41:36.359
Don't thank me yet, Ashildr.

41:37.480 --> 41:38.759
Not yet.

41:59.320 --> 42:00.559
CLARA: Okay, it's official.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.799
Silence is even worse
in a Scottish accent.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.679
Are you going to tell me
what you are brooding about?

42:04.760 --> 42:06.039
It won't stop.

42:06.120 --> 42:09.239
The repair kit I put inside of Ashildr,
long ago...

42:09.320 --> 42:12.199
-It willjust keep fixing her.
-Well, good.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.639
I'm not sure,
but it is entirely possible

42:14.760 --> 42:17.239
she has lost the ability to die.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.839
-The ability?
-Oh! (CHUCKLES)

42:20.920 --> 42:23.239
Dying is an ability, believe me.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.639
Barring accidents, she may
now be functionally immortal.

42:28.720 --> 42:30.319
(DOOR UNLOCKING)

42:30.760 --> 42:33.639
If the repair kit
never stops working, then...

42:35.080 --> 42:36.119
Why did you give her two?

42:36.880 --> 42:40.359
Immortality isn't living forever,
that's not what it feels like.

42:41.960 --> 42:44.399
Immortality is everybody else dying.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.679
She might meet someone
she can't bear to lose.

42:52.920 --> 42:54.319
That happens.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.079
I believe.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.719
-(MACHINE INITIALISING)
-I was angry.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.039
I was emotional.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.759
Just possibly,
I've made a terrible mistake.

43:10.920 --> 43:12.999
Maybe even a tidal wave.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.719
Time will tell, it always does.

43:21.480 --> 43:23.879
CLARA: Whatever you did for Ashildr,

43:24.560 --> 43:26.039
I think she deserved it.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.919
Yes. Yes, she did.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.719
But Ashildr isn't just human any more,

43:33.800 --> 43:36.319
there's a little piece of alien
inside her.

43:36.400 --> 43:38.079
So in a way, she's...

43:41.480 --> 43:42.799
In a way...

43:45.520 --> 43:47.119
She is a hybrid.

45:12.600 --> 45:13.759
-(HORSE NEIGHING)
-Whoa!

45:13.840 --> 45:15.399
-KNIGHTMARE: Stand and deliver.
-(SCREAMING)

45:16.240 --> 45:17.639
If I didn't know better,
I'd say this was a robbery.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.159
The most wanted in the land.

45:19.240 --> 45:21.039
Now is not time to be showing off.

45:21.160 --> 45:23.399
GIRL: Could it be we are looking
for the same prize?

45:23.480 --> 45:24.999
The eyes of Hades.

45:25.080 --> 45:26.799
Who is this? Your sidekick?

45:26.880 --> 45:27.959
I'm not a sidekick.

45:28.040 --> 45:29.719
GIRL: Come on, sidekick, watch me run.

45:29.800 --> 45:31.879
MR FANSHAWE:
There is an intruder on the premises!

45:31.960 --> 45:33.759
-What're you doing?
-It's kill or be killed.

45:33.840 --> 45:35.399
DOCTOR: You're playing with fire!

45:36.400 --> 45:37.479
Do you have a cat?
