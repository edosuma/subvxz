00:04.338 --> 00:05.637
I really love
what you put together

00:05.706 --> 00:07.306
for our Staff Picks display,
Milo.

00:07.375 --> 00:08.574
- Thanks!
I do a mix

00:08.642 --> 00:11.744
of mainstream hits
and obscure deep cuts.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.379
I lure them in with Batman,

00:13.447 --> 00:16.849
and then I hit them
with "Cockroach Sisters."

00:16.917 --> 00:19.118
- "Cockroach Sisters"?
That sounds like something

00:19.186 --> 00:20.219
my parents
wouldn't want me to read.

00:20.287 --> 00:22.688
- Yeah.
- Gimme!

00:22.757 --> 00:25.090
- Um, I think
I may have misunderstood.

00:25.159 --> 00:26.625
When you said "Staff Picks,"

00:26.694 --> 00:28.761
I thought you meant
"Staff Pics."

00:28.829 --> 00:30.362
You know, like,
pics of the staff?

00:31.665 --> 00:34.099
Here's me on my first day
at Warped!

00:34.168 --> 00:35.334
Here's Milo
getting a wedgie

00:35.403 --> 00:36.869
from Carl
from the Sporting Goods Store.

00:36.937 --> 00:39.038
- Why would you take
a picture of that?

00:39.106 --> 00:40.706
- Where am I?

00:41.742 --> 00:43.442
- I'm here just as much
- You as anyone. here.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.877
And I bring in business.

00:44.945 --> 00:47.279
I'm like the cute puppy
in the pet store window.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.183
- Wait a minute,

00:51.252 --> 00:52.684
you took a picture
of me sleeping?

00:52.753 --> 00:56.188
And how did you get
my senior prom picture?

00:56.257 --> 00:58.457
- I texted your mom.
Sweet lady.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.459
By the way, you could stand
to call her more.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.132
- I think someone
super famous just walked in.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.467
- Oh, my gosh.
I'd recognize

01:08.536 --> 01:09.768
that backwards cap anywhere.

01:09.837 --> 01:11.203
It's Kevin Smith!

01:11.272 --> 01:12.638
- He's everything I want to be!

01:12.706 --> 01:15.207
A writer, filmmaker,
a comic book store owner.

01:15.276 --> 01:16.842
He's basically
a professional nerd.

01:16.911 --> 01:19.311
- Let's talk to him.
- We cannot talk to him.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.914
- Excuse me,
can I talk to you?

01:22.817 --> 01:24.416
What do we do?
- Ooh,What do we do?to us.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.784
- Let's talk back.

01:27.054 --> 01:28.954
Welcome to Warped!

01:29.023 --> 01:31.323
- Yeah.
Hi, Mr. Smith.

01:32.793 --> 01:33.926
We're huge fans.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.295
I have a framed photo of you
in my room.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.696
- Get out of here.
How weird!

01:37.765 --> 01:40.432
I have a framed photo of you
in<i> my</i> room.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.733
- Really?
- No, of course not,

01:41.802 --> 01:43.268
we just met.

01:43.337 --> 01:44.536
- Good point,
good point.

01:44.605 --> 01:47.739
- So what brings you to town,
Mr. Kevin Smith?

01:47.808 --> 01:49.541
- Well, they're finally
letting me direct

01:49.610 --> 01:51.410
an episode
of "Space Conflicts," man,

01:51.479 --> 01:52.444
so that's why I'm in town.

01:52.513 --> 01:54.046
But I'm here specifically

01:54.115 --> 01:57.049
because as a proud proprietor
of a comic book store myself,

01:57.118 --> 01:58.884
I just had to lay eyes
on Warped!

01:58.953 --> 02:00.519
This place is legendary.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.121
Even as far back
as the East Coast.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.856
- Thanks!

02:03.924 --> 02:05.390
You're directing an episode
of "Space Conflicts"?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.593
That's our favorite franchise
of all time.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.395
We even visited the set.
- Yeah, we almost destroyed it.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.397
Here we are getting thrown out
by security.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.765
- That is so metal.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.733
Uh, listen kids,

02:14.802 --> 02:16.268
maybe you can help me out
with this.

02:16.337 --> 02:17.503
I came into the store

02:17.571 --> 02:19.104
looking
for a little inspiration

02:19.173 --> 02:20.472
for my next project.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.241
- Ooh, what's it about?

02:22.309 --> 02:23.942
- Tell us!
I'm great at keeping secrets.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.244
I've never told a soul

02:25.312 --> 02:26.411
that Milo still sleeps
in his parents' bed

02:26.480 --> 02:27.579
when there's a thunderstorm.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.815
- It's to protect them.

02:29.884 --> 02:32.451
- I haven't settled
on the exact topic yet.

02:32.520 --> 02:35.821
But I think it's gonna be
in the area of werewolves.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.756
So I was hoping to find
some inspiration

02:37.825 --> 02:40.826
from something in here,
so what do I owe you, kids?

02:40.895 --> 02:42.461
- It's on the house!
It's the least we could do

02:42.530 --> 02:43.829
after everything
you've given us.

02:43.898 --> 02:46.532
- Oh, the rich get richer.
Thank you so much.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.367
- But we wouldn't say no
to a photo.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.335
- I wouldn't say no
to a photo either.

02:50.404 --> 02:51.870
Come on, let's do it.

02:51.939 --> 02:55.307
Oh, you kids are adorable.
There you go, well done.

02:55.376 --> 02:56.675
Nah, I'm just kidding.
You meant selfie.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.278
I understand.
Here we go.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.213
Well done.
Look at that, kids.

03:01.282 --> 03:02.447
All right,
pleasure to meet you.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.583
Pleasure to meet you.
What a great store!

03:04.652 --> 03:06.618
Comics forever!
Warped!

03:06.687 --> 03:08.287
Warped!

03:08.355 --> 03:10.689
- That's so cool
he's doing a werewolf movie.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.090
My best friend Margo
from back home

03:12.159 --> 03:13.292
once dated a werewolf.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.760
Well, actually,
it was just a coyote

03:14.828 --> 03:16.328
she was convinced
was a werewolf.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.529
She took him
to Winter Formal

03:17.598 --> 03:19.831
and he ended up dancing
with her sister.

03:19.900 --> 03:23.168
It was a whole thing.
- I bet it was.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.571
You know, I had a good idea
for a werewolf movie

03:25.639 --> 03:27.039
back when I was
in middle school.

03:27.107 --> 03:29.007
We should dig it up
and work it into a pitch

03:29.076 --> 03:30.576
for Kevin Smith's new project.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.010
You know, he was barely
older than us

03:32.079 --> 03:33.845
when he made his first movie.
- Yeah!

03:33.914 --> 03:35.280
Maybe he'll see
a bit of himself in us

03:35.349 --> 03:36.582
and give us a shot!
- Yeah.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.083
- I can see it now.

03:38.152 --> 03:41.753
Kevin Smith presents
a Milo and Ruby movie,

03:41.822 --> 03:44.790
based on some idea Milo had
in middle school.

corndog.

I can't wait to try it!

04:34.475 --> 04:35.907
Yuck!

04:35.976 --> 04:37.209
- Maybe it just needs
some mustard.

04:37.278 --> 04:38.610
You know, you can't have
a corndog without mustard.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.651
Oh, yeah.
That's good.

Hey, we should all go
on a Gross Grub Crawl.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.495
to every food place
in the mall

04:56.563 --> 04:58.263
and order
the most disgusting thing

You two in?

05:00.334 --> 05:01.800
Sorry, as much as
we would love

05:01.869 --> 05:04.936
to eat really disgusting food,
we can't.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.005
We're working
on a new project.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.607

05:08.676 --> 05:10.542
Well, that's okay
because Darby and I

05:10.611 --> 05:13.578

05:14.682 --> 05:16.848

05:22.523 --> 05:24.356

Yeah, we'll get

My werewolf movie idea.

I've got two words for you,
"Werewolf dream."

05:32.900 --> 05:34.933
- I love it already.
Tell me more.

05:35.002 --> 05:35.901
- I can't.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.569
I only wrote down
the two words.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.805
But in remember it being
about something like

05:39.873 --> 05:42.240
a werewolf who haunts
your dreams,

05:42.309 --> 05:44.042
and then it comes to life.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.277
- That's great!

05:45.346 --> 05:46.645
Kevin Smith is gonna love this.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.213
We'll work up
a great presentation

05:48.282 --> 05:51.383

maybe a performance element.

05:51.452 --> 05:53.018
How are you at gymnastics?

05:53.087 --> 05:56.355
- Maybe we should start
with characters and the plot.

05:56.423 --> 05:57.756
- Good idea.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.794

06:19.380 --> 06:20.846
- Yeah, this egg salad soup

06:20.914 --> 06:23.448
is somehow hotter and colder
than I thought it would be.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.584
- There you are.

06:25.652 --> 06:26.852
I've been waiting forever

06:32.459 --> 06:34.526

we're supposedly working on?

Milo and Ruby to think

06:47.141 --> 06:48.407

Aw, a penny.

in your pants.

07:07.261 --> 07:09.761
It's all the non-pizza stuff
that gets stuck on it.

07:09.830 --> 07:11.530
- Well, there's your idea.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.031
Darby's great
at designing clothes,

07:13.100 --> 07:15.434
Hurley's good

Pizza Pants!

- That's a great idea.

07:21.742 --> 07:25.043
We can design pants
to keep your pizza in.

07:25.112 --> 07:27.712
