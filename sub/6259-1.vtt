WEBVTT

00:22.515 --> 00:24.548
What have I done?

00:28.719 --> 00:30.786
What have I done?

04:02.384 --> 04:06.452
- Be careful. Don't wake her.
- Don't worry. She's dead to the world.

04:08.888 --> 04:10.755
It's so peaceful here.

04:11.590 --> 04:13.924
Yeah, I have a good feeling
about this place.

04:19.829 --> 04:22.697
- Look at this view.
- I know, right?

04:30.037 --> 04:33.071
I had forgotten how beautiful
this house is.

04:42.046 --> 04:44.514
You can see the ocean from here.

04:49.186 --> 04:52.154
Hey, quick.
Turn her around from the window.

04:58.394 --> 05:02.764
- What's wrong with her?
- I think she's just having a nightmare.

05:03.066 --> 05:07.167
- Faye, are you all right?
- She doesn't look good.

05:07.269 --> 05:09.771
It's just a reaction to the sedative
I've given her.

05:09.871 --> 05:13.524
- She's a little disoriented right now.
- So why'd you give her something so strong?

05:13.624 --> 05:16.460
Because it took us an hour
and a half to get here.

05:16.560 --> 05:20.394
Did you really want me to risk her
waking up in the middle of our trip?

05:21.579 --> 05:25.183
How are you doing? Faye?

05:25.283 --> 05:27.785
- Are you okay?
- Remember this house, dear?

05:27.885 --> 05:30.487
Remember we talked
about this place for months?

05:30.587 --> 05:33.490
About coming here
so that you continue your therapy

05:33.590 --> 05:36.421
from inside the safety of your house.

05:41.462 --> 05:43.364
I think she's ready.

05:43.464 --> 05:46.600
Not yet. She still seems very disoriented.

05:46.700 --> 05:50.170
This was an awful idea.
How could you agree to this, Tom?

05:50.270 --> 05:51.833
Faye wanted this.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.622
I'm here. I'm in the room.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.418
How are you feeling?

05:58.940 --> 06:01.810
- My head is pounding.
- I'm so sorry.

06:01.910 --> 06:05.046
That's just a side effect
from the sedative I've given you.

06:05.146 --> 06:08.660
- Are you okay?
- Do you remember this house, honey?

06:12.784 --> 06:15.753
- Vaguely.
- Where are you?

06:15.853 --> 06:19.223
- My father's house.
- And why are you here?

06:19.323 --> 06:21.372
I'm here to get better.

06:21.890 --> 06:25.361
Are you ready to take a look
at the view outside?

06:25.461 --> 06:29.191
- No, I don't think I'm ready yet.
- Faye, you can do this.

06:30.162 --> 06:33.998
Just remember
the breathing exercises, alright?

06:34.098 --> 06:37.801
You're going to breathe in
through your nose

06:37.901 --> 06:39.536
for a count of five,

06:39.636 --> 06:42.333
and then breathe out through your mouth.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.401
Five again.

06:50.575 --> 06:54.112
Now, it's okay.
Get ready to turn her around.

06:54.512 --> 06:57.042
Come on, Faye, you can do it.

07:09.723 --> 07:14.028
There we go. There we go.

07:14.128 --> 07:18.431
Come on. That's it. That's it, baby girl.

07:18.531 --> 07:21.801
You see? You see?
You're only a few feet from the glass.

07:21.901 --> 07:25.321
You're safe now.
Nothing bad is going to happen to you.

07:25.421 --> 07:27.573
How long is this going to last?

07:27.673 --> 07:30.304
She's doing good. Right, babe?

07:33.744 --> 07:35.325
- Right, babe?
- No!

07:35.425 --> 07:38.111
Turn her back around. Turn her around.

07:40.950 --> 07:43.051
You did so good.

07:43.151 --> 07:45.448
I'm proud of you, baby.

07:51.324 --> 07:54.595
- I need a drink.
- There's a bottle of vodka in the kitchen.

07:54.695 --> 07:59.661
- I don't know how old it is though.
- Vodka doesn't go bad, right?

08:04.469 --> 08:06.658
Come on, Faye.

08:07.538 --> 08:10.061
Show me the rest of your new house.

08:23.386 --> 08:25.422
So what kind of draconian
treatment is this?

08:25.522 --> 08:29.325
It's called cognitive behavioral treatment

08:29.425 --> 08:33.361
- and exposure therapy.
- You're causing her anxiety on purpose.

08:33.462 --> 08:37.119
It's one of the known cures
for agoraphobia.

08:42.034 --> 08:44.725
This can be my bedroom when I stay over.

08:47.606 --> 08:50.143
Look at the view from up here.

08:50.643 --> 08:52.528
And you listened to this quack?

08:52.628 --> 08:57.115
Faye and I decided that this place would
be the ideal place to continue the therapy.

08:57.215 --> 09:00.104
Here she can be closer
to the outside world.

09:03.686 --> 09:05.321
I'm definitely getting a new mattress.

09:05.421 --> 09:08.557
I refuse to sleep where my father
slept with that witch all those years.

09:08.657 --> 09:10.659
You can afford a whole new set.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.255
Her father dying and leaving her
this place might be the best thing

09:13.355 --> 09:15.740
- he ever did for her.
- The only thing,

09:15.890 --> 09:19.225
considering he locked her up in a boarding
school and never saw her again.

09:19.325 --> 09:23.821
Being in this house might reverse
all those years of neglect.

09:24.871 --> 09:26.045
Yeah.

09:29.340 --> 09:34.098
Oh, my God. I think this closet
is bigger than my entire condo.

09:38.347 --> 09:41.617
- What happened?
- The door just closed by itself.

09:41.717 --> 09:43.972
It's probably a draft.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.990
Look at this bathroom!

09:49.090 --> 09:53.680
- But all the windows are closed.
- What I'd give to get a listing like this.

09:56.946 --> 09:59.531
Commission on our condo not good enough?

09:59.631 --> 10:01.920
I have a surprise.

10:02.916 --> 10:04.922
A surprise?

10:06.637 --> 10:09.005
I thought you didn't want any pets.

10:09.105 --> 10:11.641
I rescued him
right before they... you know.

10:11.741 --> 10:15.229
Who would want to put
this beautiful little guy to sleep?

10:17.310 --> 10:19.709
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

10:20.378 --> 10:23.748
- He'll keep you company when I'm at work.
- He's a big guy.

10:23.848 --> 10:26.951
Hey, Dr. Murphy and Margie are leaving.

10:27.051 --> 10:30.520
I have to go. They're my ride back.
Call me if you need anything, all right?

10:30.620 --> 10:32.741
- I'll be fine.
- Okay.

10:35.856 --> 10:38.359
Welcome home, my beautiful wife.

10:38.459 --> 10:40.580
I'm gonna get better here.

10:41.026 --> 10:42.895
I'm going to go see them off.

10:42.995 --> 10:45.549
- Tell them I say "bye."
- All right.

10:47.697 --> 10:49.386
Hi!

10:57.271 --> 10:59.040
You come up with a name for him yet?

10:59.340 --> 11:02.362
Hamlet, like my favorite character.

11:03.074 --> 11:06.612
Seriously? A crazy, suicidal guy?

11:06.712 --> 11:09.534
Yeah, it's fitting, don't you think?

11:13.416 --> 11:15.905
Really? You're gonna work right now?

11:16.685 --> 11:19.088
I didn't want to tell you
until I was sure.

11:19.188 --> 11:21.784
- What?
- The case I'm working on,

11:21.884 --> 11:24.925
it's going to trial, and they
want me to lead the trial team.

11:25.325 --> 11:26.859
That's great.

11:26.959 --> 11:30.932
Yeah, it's a great opportunity for me,
especially if I want to make partner.

11:32.595 --> 11:34.965
What's wrong? What aren't you telling me?

11:35.065 --> 11:39.836
Well, the trial would be held
at the downtown courthouse.

11:39.936 --> 11:43.372
If I take the case,
I can't come home every night.

11:43.472 --> 11:47.058
- And leave me here by myself?
- No, we can get Stephanie to stay with you.

11:47.158 --> 11:50.395
No, absolutely not.
I'm sick of being a burden to her.

11:51.345 --> 11:53.714
I'll find somebody else
to come stay with you.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.448
A complete stranger?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.584
Somebody to just help you take care
of this place while I'm gone.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.840
You'll have time to work
on your dissertation.

12:03.720 --> 12:07.544
Okay, fine.
I'll tell 'em I can't take the case.

12:10.025 --> 12:11.859
Wait...

12:12.259 --> 12:14.747
If it's important to you...

12:15.960 --> 12:18.082
Are you sure?

12:18.461 --> 12:20.316
Yes.

12:43.181 --> 12:46.235
Hey, little guy, what are you looking at?

13:37.230 --> 13:40.621
Hamlet, not everything is a toy.

13:48.306 --> 13:52.830
You better behave. We don't want
this lady thinking we're crazy. Come on.

14:02.818 --> 14:06.955
- Did Tom explain about Faye's condition?
- He told me she's afraid to go outside.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.940
Good. Then I don't have
to go into all that.

14:09.040 --> 14:13.894
- I hope Stephanie is not scaring you away.
- No, your husband had already filled me in.

14:13.994 --> 14:17.647
And you still want to take the job?
Are we paying her more than I thought?

14:17.747 --> 14:20.132
Better than any other jobs around here.

14:20.232 --> 14:23.601
Reception here is crap, and I need to call
someone back on one of my listings.

14:23.701 --> 14:25.769
The only phone that works
is in my father's old office.

14:25.869 --> 14:28.355
- Just one phone?
- I know. They're installing more next week.

14:28.455 --> 14:30.556
Okay, I gotta use
the little girls' room first.

14:30.656 --> 14:33.101
Use the guest bathroom upstairs.
I just put fresh towels in there.

14:33.201 --> 14:34.962
Awesome.

14:36.355 --> 14:39.464
- Well, let me show you around, yeah?
- Sure, yeah.

14:41.044 --> 14:43.367
So this is the kitchen.

14:44.080 --> 14:47.718
- This is such a pretty house.
- Oh, thank you.

14:49.184 --> 14:51.370
I don't mean to be nosy, but...

14:51.470 --> 14:54.573
how did you meet your husband
if you never go out?

14:54.673 --> 14:56.858
I have been going to bars for years,

14:56.958 --> 14:58.826
and I still haven't met anybody
worth my time.

14:58.926 --> 15:03.263
Tom actually worked as a clerk at the
attorney's office that represented my father.

15:03.363 --> 15:06.949
And one day, he was asked to bring me
my monthly allowance because...

15:07.049 --> 15:11.170
- they couldn't get a courier.
- And he just showed up at your door?

15:11.270 --> 15:15.574
And then he volunteered to keep
bringing it every month after that.

15:15.674 --> 15:18.229
Come on. I'll show you upstairs.

15:21.111 --> 15:25.302
And this is our room.
And down there is the master bath.

15:28.684 --> 15:30.419
This is a lot of cleaning.

15:30.519 --> 15:34.056
Most of the rooms won't be used, so you'll
only have to clean them once in a while.

15:34.156 --> 15:37.012
My God, look at this view.

15:38.393 --> 15:40.815
I'm sorry, I forgot.

15:41.628 --> 15:42.696
It's okay.

15:42.896 --> 15:46.250
I'll try really hard to remember
from now on, I promise.

15:47.266 --> 15:49.412
Really, it's okay.

15:50.932 --> 15:53.537
By the way I'm going to be having
a mattress delivered tomorrow,

15:53.637 --> 15:56.373
so I need you to open the door
for the delivery guy.

15:56.573 --> 15:58.761
That's easy enough.

15:59.874 --> 16:02.310
This is a huge bathroom.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.498
Oh, I'll take care of this.

16:12.050 --> 16:14.605
I thought I laid these out.

16:16.285 --> 16:20.314
I have to go. I called my office,
and I have to put out some fires.

16:20.757 --> 16:23.192
Did you put the bathroom mats
back in this box?

16:23.292 --> 16:25.580
I haven't been in here.

16:26.359 --> 16:29.049
That's so weird.
I could have sworn that I...

16:31.497 --> 16:33.386
Never mind.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.990
I'm gonna miss you so much.

16:41.171 --> 16:43.908
I will come to see you all the time.

16:44.008 --> 16:45.776
- All right.
- I have to go.

16:45.876 --> 16:48.598
- Okay.
- Bye.

16:52.213 --> 16:57.753
Sorry, make yourself at home. I'll just be
in the office working on my dissertation.

16:57.853 --> 16:59.687
Dissertation?

16:59.987 --> 17:02.257
Yeah, I'm trying to get my PhD.

17:02.357 --> 17:04.709
Cool. In what?

17:04.809 --> 17:06.530
Psychology.

17:06.925 --> 17:11.598
I want to be able to eventually help people
who are suffering from my condition.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.419
Right.

17:14.799 --> 17:18.857
I'll go to my car and get my stuff
and move them inside.

17:35.316 --> 17:37.519
- Where is she?
- Excuse me.

17:37.619 --> 17:39.654
Where's that little hermit?

17:39.754 --> 17:42.556
- Is she expecting you?
- She isn't expecting this.

17:42.656 --> 17:45.458
Elizabeth, what a surprise.

17:45.558 --> 17:50.462
If you think you can get away with this,
you're dead wrong. This is my house!

17:50.562 --> 17:54.765
I think you're suffering from misplaced anger.
It's my dad that you're really mad at.

17:54.865 --> 17:58.267
Don't give me your psycho-babble bullshit.
I was practically married to your father.

17:58.367 --> 18:01.803
And yet all he left you was the condo,
and he left me everything else.

18:01.903 --> 18:04.772
All you ever did was try yo make him
feel guilty about being with me.

18:04.872 --> 18:08.408
Please. He could've cared less
about what I thought.

18:08.508 --> 18:10.758
You just must've done something
really wrong that made him

18:10.858 --> 18:13.512
not wanna give you
anything else in his will.

18:13.612 --> 18:16.047
I treated your father like a king.

18:16.147 --> 18:19.469
Better than that whore of a mother
of yours ever did.

18:20.482 --> 18:22.651
Leave my mother out of this.

18:22.751 --> 18:26.788
She never cared about either one of you.
She left and never looked back.

18:26.888 --> 18:30.674
Yeah, when you showed up. You pushed her
away so that you could be with him.

18:30.774 --> 18:33.529
You're just as crazy as she is.

18:34.292 --> 18:38.463
Okay. You need to go
before I call the police.

18:38.563 --> 18:40.465
You're going to regret this.

18:40.565 --> 18:45.536
This is my house, and I will get it back.

18:46.036 --> 18:47.790
Now!

18:55.644 --> 18:58.179
I am so sorry I let her in.

18:58.279 --> 19:00.747
I had no idea who she was.

19:01.247 --> 19:04.718
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

19:04.818 --> 19:08.554
I bet you didn't realize you were gonna
be playing the role of a bouncer, did you?

19:08.654 --> 19:11.557
But you shouldn't even let her
get to you anyway.

19:11.657 --> 19:14.046
She's obviously trash.

19:37.578 --> 19:40.201
Nina, is that you?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.471
Tom, are you home?

20:15.278 --> 20:18.115
The doctor just left,
but I can call him back.

20:23.852 --> 20:26.188
You've lost a lot of blood, Faye.

20:26.288 --> 20:28.573
I'm not going to any hospital.

20:35.962 --> 20:38.251
How long did you know?

20:38.964 --> 20:41.717
- I didn't.
- Come on, how could you not have known?

20:41.817 --> 20:44.872
My cycle has always
been a little messed up.

20:45.585 --> 20:47.874
We have to be more careful.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.961
What?

20:52.907 --> 20:55.430
Or not be careful at all.

20:55.776 --> 20:59.680
We've been married for three years, maybe
it's a sign that we should start trying.

20:59.780 --> 21:02.514
What? Are you cra...

21:02.614 --> 21:04.967
Faye, you are in no condition
to be having a baby right now.

21:05.067 --> 21:07.519
- I'll have Nina to help me.
- Be rational, come on.

21:07.619 --> 21:10.622
What is so irrational about wanting
the life that everyone else has?

21:10.722 --> 21:13.557
Of course it's normal
that you want a baby.

21:13.657 --> 21:17.781
It's just that in your condition,
you can't be having any kids right now.

21:23.163 --> 21:26.867
As soon as you get better,
I promise we'll have one, two...

21:26.967 --> 21:29.169
three, however many you want.

21:29.269 --> 21:31.591
That's what we came here for.

21:37.342 --> 21:40.846
Come on, Hamlet.
It's time for our therapy.

21:51.186 --> 21:55.877
I can do this, baby. One day
I'm gonna walk right through those doors.

22:23.916 --> 22:26.086
And you're gonna come with me, okay?

23:07.790 --> 23:10.529
This is going to be harder than I thought.

23:11.793 --> 23:14.996
- Tom told me what happened last night.
- He shouldn't have told you that.

23:15.096 --> 23:16.697
You should have gone to the hospital.

23:16.797 --> 23:19.632
- It wasn't that serious.
- He said it was a lot of blood.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.355
It just seemed that way because I was
in a bathtub when it happened.

23:25.602 --> 23:27.858
Tell me the truth.

23:28.037 --> 23:31.038
You knew you were pregnant. You just
didn't want Tom to know until it was too late

23:31.138 --> 23:37.030
- to do something about it.
- No. No, I swear I had no idea, but...

23:37.543 --> 23:39.677
But, now...

23:39.777 --> 23:41.314
What?

23:41.414 --> 23:44.281
Now I want to have a baby so badly.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.116
It's...

23:46.416 --> 23:49.536
It's just given me so much more
resolve to get better soon.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.621
Oh, that's great.

23:51.721 --> 23:54.724
I've been doing this thing where I get
closer to the door every day,

23:54.824 --> 23:56.759
and sometimes I'll bring Hamlet with me.

23:56.859 --> 23:59.828
It's really weird,
but he's actually been helping me a lot.

23:59.928 --> 24:01.449
The cat?

24:05.198 --> 24:10.180
How much more inspiration do you need to go
outside than to look at this beautiful view?

24:10.870 --> 24:14.740
- You would think.
- I can see how the city might be scary, but...

24:14.840 --> 24:17.788
what can possibly go wrong here?

24:17.888 --> 24:22.322
- I can't really explain.
- Maybe what you need to do is just run out.

24:22.422 --> 24:25.883
One quick dash across the door,
and you'd be free.

24:25.983 --> 24:28.752
Come on, Faye, try it.
It's like what the doctor said.

24:28.852 --> 24:31.554
- What are you doing?
- Exposure therapy.

24:31.654 --> 24:34.673
- No! Stop! No! No!
- I know you're scared...

24:34.773 --> 24:37.992
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! No! No! No! No!

24:38.092 --> 24:40.377
- What's going on?
- Close the door.

24:41.593 --> 24:45.563
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I was just trying to help you.

24:45.663 --> 24:49.686
- Should I call her doctor?
- You want us to call Dr. Murphy?

24:51.299 --> 24:54.470
Just lie down on the couch
and take a little nap. You'll be fine.

24:54.570 --> 24:56.905
- Why would you do that?
- Is she gonna be okay?

24:57.005 --> 24:59.527
Just let her sleep. She'll be just fine.

24:59.940 --> 25:03.130
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

25:07.879 --> 25:10.769
Please forgive me. I'm sorry.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.084
Oh, hi, baby.

25:51.184 --> 25:53.819
Are you afraid of the storm?

27:08.950 --> 27:12.106
Is there anything else you want to
tell me about what happened tonight?

27:14.253 --> 27:15.855
What happened?

27:15.955 --> 27:19.625
She's fine. She just got
a little startled, that's all.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.511
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'll explain everything later.

27:22.611 --> 27:25.830
Apparently somebody broke into the house
while your wife was sleeping.

27:25.930 --> 27:30.588
- Do you need me anymore tonight?
- No, not really. Thank you.

27:31.467 --> 27:34.923
I'm calling an alarm company right now.
I'll be back.

27:36.236 --> 27:38.492
All right, here's my number.

27:38.988 --> 27:42.212
Call me if you think of anything else.
All right?

27:45.744 --> 27:48.233
Did you know my father?

27:49.013 --> 27:52.035
- Not really. We rarely saw him around here.
- Really?

27:52.135 --> 27:55.353
Yeah, we were kind of surprised when we
found out he had passed away here.

27:55.453 --> 27:59.089
- Here? Like in this house?
- I thought you knew.

27:59.189 --> 28:02.492
- The cleaning lady called it in.
- Do you know how he died?

28:02.592 --> 28:06.112
According to the medical examiner
he had a heart attack.

28:06.212 --> 28:09.664
Could someone have killed him
and made it look like a heart attack?

28:09.764 --> 28:12.486
No, there was no sign of foul play.

28:13.032 --> 28:16.203
Look, I know about your condition.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.023
My late wife,

28:18.123 --> 28:22.621
she had bipolar disorder,
she felt alone in this world,

28:22.721 --> 28:25.510
'cause people couldn't understand
why she just couldn't get over it.

28:25.610 --> 28:28.313
Your late wife? What happened to her?

28:29.313 --> 28:31.811
She overdosed on some pills one night.

28:32.681 --> 28:34.382
I'm so sorry.

28:35.249 --> 28:37.986
I did understand
what she was going through

28:38.086 --> 28:42.527
so if you need someone to talk to,
do call me, all right?

28:46.526 --> 28:49.396
I called the company that does
the security in my building at work,

28:49.496 --> 28:54.884
- and they're gonna install an alarm tomorrow.
- Great. All right, I'm done here.

28:55.434 --> 28:58.036
You have my number.
Call me if you need anything.

28:58.136 --> 29:01.092
- Thank you.
- I'll keep in touch.

29:06.977 --> 29:10.601
I forgot to tell you.
Elizabeth is disputing the will.

29:11.381 --> 29:13.316
Can she even do that?

29:13.416 --> 29:16.338
Yeah, but don't worry.
I'll take care of her.

29:17.218 --> 29:19.713
Nothing that witch does
even bothers me anymore,

29:20.093 --> 29:22.760
- but...
- But what?

29:24.023 --> 29:28.073
I need you here with me.
I don't feel safe here alone.

29:28.459 --> 29:29.928
I know, baby, give it some time.

29:30.028 --> 29:33.598
The trial will be over in a couple weeks,
and I'll be here more.

29:33.898 --> 29:37.300
I was thinking.
My father left me all that money.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.069
There's no reason for you
to work ever again.

29:40.169 --> 29:44.873
- Babe, that's your money, not mine.
- You're my husband. It's our money.

29:44.973 --> 29:46.874
You want me to be a kept man
the rest of my life?

29:46.974 --> 29:50.010
No, you can help me
run my father's business.

29:50.110 --> 29:52.611
I don't know anything about your
father's business. I'm an attorney.

29:52.711 --> 29:55.957
Exactly, stressing yourself out to
eventually make partner, and then what?

29:56.057 --> 29:59.917
- You know what.
- Yeah, more stress and more hours.

30:00.017 --> 30:04.053
Why don't you just retire
and go fishing every day?

30:04.153 --> 30:07.656
And buy a boat. It could be outside,
right out back, right behind our house.

30:07.756 --> 30:10.141
Come on, isn't that what everyone
dreams of, retiring early?

30:10.241 --> 30:12.896
No, not me.

30:13.358 --> 30:17.103
Babe, give it some time. You're going to do
so much better now that you're here.

30:20.364 --> 30:23.854
Now, what's really bothering you?
I know you and something's up.

30:27.369 --> 30:30.593
I think my father's ghost
is haunting this house.

30:34.842 --> 30:36.897
Where are you going?

30:37.810 --> 30:39.613
I have court in the morning.

30:39.713 --> 30:42.502
If I'm going to be there on time,
I have to be up at five a.m.

30:57.061 --> 31:01.485
Faye. The alarm guy is here.
He wants to show us how the system works.

31:02.531 --> 31:04.753
Hey, Nina.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.836
Did you move my shoes last night
after I went to sleep?

31:08.936 --> 31:10.637
What shoes?

31:10.737 --> 31:14.357
My sandals. Stephanie put them next
to the couch, and I can't find them now.

31:14.457 --> 31:16.312
I can help you look for them.

31:17.341 --> 31:20.597
- I'm sure they're somewhere around here.
- Okay.

31:23.879 --> 31:26.819
There's nothing to be afraid of.

31:29.983 --> 31:33.354
You know, many patients that are
undergoing your medical treatment

31:33.454 --> 31:36.390
have experienced similar symptoms:

31:36.490 --> 31:40.323
forgetfulness, anxiety...

31:40.425 --> 31:43.562
- even paranoia.
- It's not the medication.

31:43.662 --> 31:47.204
The first time it happened, I could say that
I imagined the thing with the bath mats,

31:47.304 --> 31:50.934
but my shoes... I found them
on the shoe rack in my closet upstairs.

31:51.034 --> 31:54.370
- What's so strange about that?
- I hadn't been upstairs since the morning.

31:54.470 --> 31:58.474
There's no way I wouldn't have remembered
walking around barefoot all day.

31:58.974 --> 32:02.844
So you mean that
there's ghosts in the house?

32:03.544 --> 32:07.715
Since I've gotten here, I've felt like
something or someone is just around me.

32:07.815 --> 32:09.216
Look...

32:09.316 --> 32:13.586
you're undergoing
a lot of stress these days.

32:14.086 --> 32:16.788
What with your father's death...

32:17.288 --> 32:19.924
moving into a new house,

32:20.024 --> 32:23.713
Tom's absence due to his workload.

32:24.926 --> 32:27.830
You know what? I'm going to prescribe
a new medication for you.

32:27.930 --> 32:30.783
I don't need more meds.
I'm getting so much better.

32:30.883 --> 32:33.518
I'm doing the breathing
and the exposure therapy.

32:33.668 --> 32:36.437
Every day I'm getting a little closer
to the glass doors.

32:36.537 --> 32:42.005
Agoraphobia is just a symptom
of the underlying panic disorder.

32:42.740 --> 32:46.144
How is your dissertation going?

32:46.244 --> 32:50.747
I haven't really had much time to...
work on it since I've been here.

32:50.847 --> 32:53.649
Well, that's understandable,

32:53.749 --> 32:56.651
but you can't let it get too far away.

32:56.751 --> 33:00.440
I won't.
You know how important that is to me.

33:00.919 --> 33:03.942
I'm afraid time's up for today.

33:05.055 --> 33:07.258
Doctor Murphy...

33:07.558 --> 33:11.261
I'm not imagining things. I swear.

33:11.761 --> 33:15.397
Faye, I know it's tricky for you...

33:15.497 --> 33:18.621
but you have to fight for your recovery.

33:23.736 --> 33:27.260
Are you going to be okay
until I see you next week?

33:45.321 --> 33:47.210
Nina?

33:49.858 --> 33:52.949
Nina, can you turn that down a little bit?

35:39.624 --> 35:41.847
Nina, is that you?

35:42.660 --> 35:45.049
Nina, come out, please.

36:08.117 --> 36:09.873
Hey.

36:19.528 --> 36:21.684
There's nothing there.

36:22.530 --> 36:24.066
What about that song that was playing?

36:24.166 --> 36:26.701
- What about it?
- It was my father's favorite.

36:26.801 --> 36:29.403
Then it makes perfect sense
for it to still be on the turntable.

36:29.503 --> 36:31.038
It was playing by itself.

36:31.138 --> 36:33.072
Maybe the cat jumped up there
and turned it on.

36:33.172 --> 36:36.192
- No, the door was locked.
- Then, how did you get in?

36:36.292 --> 36:38.897
It opened by itself.

36:39.710 --> 36:42.897
Babe, your dad's ghost
is not haunting you.

36:42.997 --> 36:45.866
I don't know. A lot of weird things
have been happening in this place.

36:45.966 --> 36:49.435
- You're still getting used to the new house.
- I don't wanna get used to it. I wanna leave.

36:49.585 --> 36:51.753
- And go where?
- Back to our condo.

36:51.853 --> 36:53.938
We can't. It's already under contract.

36:54.038 --> 36:56.880
Then we'll go somewhere else.
Anywhere else. I just don't want to be here.

36:56.980 --> 37:00.581
- I'm afraid of this place.
- Babe, you need to relax.

37:01.544 --> 37:04.531
Come on. Let's go get
some medicine and take a nap.

37:04.631 --> 37:06.452
Okay.

38:03.949 --> 38:04.951
Where were you?

38:05.051 --> 38:07.653
I went to take the stuff
in the den to storage.

38:07.753 --> 38:10.772
- And Nina?
- She said she didn't do it, Faye.

38:11.855 --> 38:14.445
I want you to fire her right now.

38:17.427 --> 38:20.798
I can't fire her, Faye.
Who's gonna take care of you?

38:20.898 --> 38:23.200
- You.
- We've already been over that.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.302
Okay, well, then someone else.

38:25.402 --> 38:28.205
You have no idea
how hard it was to find her.

38:28.305 --> 38:32.608
She's the reason I can't find Hamlet.
I don't want her here.

38:32.708 --> 38:36.077
Please, Faye, you got to work with me.
The trial will be over in another week.

38:36.177 --> 38:38.879
And I'll take a vacation
and I'll find somebody else. I promise.

38:38.979 --> 38:40.981
And leave here again with her?

38:41.081 --> 38:43.769
It's just for another week.

38:45.316 --> 38:47.905
What am I gonna do without Hamlet?

38:49.151 --> 38:53.475
He's a cat. He'll find his way home.
They always do.

38:55.055 --> 38:57.077
Come here.

39:04.897 --> 39:08.621
- Oh, I didn't know you were in here.
- I'm just getting dinner ready.

39:10.368 --> 39:13.891
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm just getting a drink.

39:16.939 --> 39:19.662
I'm so sorry that cat got out.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.579
I can take a walk tomorrow morning
and see if I find him for you.

39:24.179 --> 39:25.667
Thanks.

39:36.589 --> 39:39.140
- What is that?
- What's wrong?

39:42.877 --> 39:45.334
I'm just making beef stew.

39:48.715 --> 39:51.789
- See?
- What did you do with Hamlet?

39:53.468 --> 39:56.007
Tom! Tom!

39:57.336 --> 40:00.974
Tom! Tom, come here, please!

40:01.574 --> 40:03.457
- Coming.
- Tom, hurry!

40:03.557 --> 40:06.445
- What?
- I told you she did it. She killed Hamlet.

40:06.545 --> 40:09.347
I saw all the blood.
She must have changed her apron,

40:09.447 --> 40:12.316
but I saw his collar in the stew,
and all of his blood.

40:12.616 --> 40:15.784
- What is she talking about?
- I don't know. I'm just making beef stew.

40:15.884 --> 40:19.174
It's not beef. I saw his collar in there!

40:26.792 --> 40:30.362
Faye, Faye, what is wrong?
You're not making any sense.

40:30.462 --> 40:32.664
No, no, I saw his collar.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.231
Are you okay?

40:35.331 --> 40:37.720
Get her pills.

40:41.303 --> 40:43.625
Come on, let's go upstairs.

40:48.608 --> 40:52.079
I mean, I just don't know how much
longer I can keep doing this.

40:52.179 --> 40:54.734
Like, she's totally losing it.

40:55.680 --> 40:57.469
Right.

41:01.317 --> 41:04.073
Listen, I'll call you back. I'm busy.

42:10.282 --> 42:13.336
Let me out of here! Faye!

42:14.386 --> 42:17.141
Faye, please let me out of here!

42:18.622 --> 42:22.358
- Nina, what's wrong?
- Faye, let me out please!

42:22.458 --> 42:24.537
I think it's locked from your side!

42:24.927 --> 42:28.750
No, there's no lock on this side!
Please, Faye!

43:40.962 --> 43:43.665
Okay, the crime scene techs
and I are done in there,

43:43.765 --> 43:46.353
unless you have anything
you need to tell me.

43:48.037 --> 43:50.203
Excuse me for a second.
I gotta use the phone really quick.

43:50.303 --> 43:52.224
Sure, go ahead.

43:56.606 --> 43:59.129
Is there anything you have to tell me?

44:01.043 --> 44:03.649
You know you can trust me, right?

44:04.879 --> 44:07.583
Does it have to do
with your father's death?

44:08.183 --> 44:11.906
- How could it?
- Then what is it you're not telling me?

44:12.652 --> 44:15.422
You can't trust what someone
like me believes, right?

44:15.522 --> 44:19.178
If you tell me you saw something,
I believe you.

44:24.360 --> 44:28.245
No. I didn't see anything.
I just heard her screaming, and...

44:28.345 --> 44:30.576
I found her that way.

44:34.134 --> 44:37.290
Sorry, I had to call someone
to come stay with her tomorrow.

44:38.370 --> 44:40.339
Is there gonna be
any sort of investigation?

44:40.439 --> 44:42.861
No, I don't think so.

44:43.474 --> 44:45.463
It appears to be an accident.

44:46.209 --> 44:48.698
All right, we're done here.

44:49.911 --> 44:52.667
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

44:55.349 --> 44:57.568
I talked to your aunt, she said
she'd come to stay with you tomorrow.

44:57.668 --> 45:00.235
I want you to stay with me.

45:00.335 --> 45:03.343
Tom, before Nina died, she was banging
on the door of the laundry room

45:03.443 --> 45:06.080
- and she couldn't get out.
- She what?

45:06.340 --> 45:09.259
She was pulling from the inside
and I was pushing from the outside,

45:09.359 --> 45:12.228
- and the door wouldn't open.
- There's no lock on that door, you know that.

45:12.328 --> 45:15.650
- I know. Exactly.
- So what are you saying?

45:15.997 --> 45:17.665
She was screaming hysterically.

45:17.765 --> 45:21.568
There had to have been someone or something
in there that wouldn't let her out.

45:21.668 --> 45:24.003
Are you talking about
your dead father again?

45:24.103 --> 45:26.658
Please, please believe me.

45:27.170 --> 45:29.740
Why would your father want to hurt Nina?

45:30.240 --> 45:32.475
I can't believe
I just asked that question.

45:32.575 --> 45:35.845
I don't know. I'm not sure what he wants.

45:36.345 --> 45:37.879
Babe, please stop this.

45:37.979 --> 45:41.749
I'm not making this up.
I'm not imagining things.

45:41.849 --> 45:46.229
Look... you're going to be alone for a couple
of hours until Aunt Margie gets here,

45:46.329 --> 45:49.555
- but you're gonna be okay.
- No, Tom, please!

45:49.655 --> 45:51.910
It's been a long day.

46:03.033 --> 46:04.967
What do we do?

46:05.067 --> 46:07.904
- Where are you going? Stay here.
- I have to go see if somebody's out there.

46:08.004 --> 46:10.639
The alarm company
will call the police. Stop.

46:10.739 --> 46:12.574
I'm sure the alarm scared 'em away.

46:12.674 --> 46:16.230
Which the police can verify
when they get here. Stop it, Tom.

46:23.347 --> 46:25.384
- That's weird.
- What?

46:25.784 --> 46:29.720
- The laser sensors got tripped up.
- The ones on the inside of the house?

46:29.820 --> 46:33.897
How can the sensors inside the house get
triggered before the outside sensors did?

46:37.826 --> 46:40.917
No, Tom! Please, please,
don't go out there. Please.

47:12.692 --> 47:14.728
Did you call the police?

47:14.828 --> 47:16.796
I think we've had
enough police here for one day.

47:16.896 --> 47:19.431
No, I'd feel better
if they searched the house.

47:19.531 --> 47:21.299
Don't be afraid, baby. You got me!

47:21.399 --> 47:25.169
Okay, I know, but I'd prefer
a couple of policemen with guns.

47:25.269 --> 47:28.471
- I got a gun I can show you.
- I've already seen your gun.

47:28.571 --> 47:31.126
Maybe you need to see it again.

47:41.215 --> 47:42.876
So you believe me?

47:44.750 --> 47:46.918
Of course.

47:47.018 --> 47:49.021
I've always believed in those things.

47:49.121 --> 47:52.140
But why are you so sure
that it's your father?

47:52.240 --> 47:55.793
Well, first of all, he died here.

47:56.093 --> 48:00.116
Your father died here? In this house?

48:01.262 --> 48:04.232
Well, I'd heard that he
hardly came here anymore.

48:04.432 --> 48:05.622
Really?

48:05.722 --> 48:09.040
Elizabeth always complained
to a mutual friend of ours at the club

48:09.140 --> 48:11.791
that he never wanted to come down here.

48:13.304 --> 48:15.906
- Why didn't he just sell it?
- I don't know.

48:16.006 --> 48:20.163
He and I never talked
after your mother left.

48:23.044 --> 48:27.148
- Why won't you talk to me about her?
- I don't want to cause you any more pain.

48:27.248 --> 48:32.949
I'm so tired of everyone treating me
like I'm some sort of emotional cripple.

48:35.720 --> 48:39.460
Fine, what do you want to know?

48:43.292 --> 48:45.161
What happened between them?

48:45.261 --> 48:49.898
I've already told you how she suffered
from depression for many years.

48:50.298 --> 48:54.202
Your father worked long hours
and stayed away.

48:54.302 --> 48:59.059
That just drove her deeper
and deeper into her depression.

49:03.208 --> 49:05.411
What happened on the day that she left?

49:05.511 --> 49:09.181
She showed up at my house and asked me
to watch you for a couple of hours.

49:09.581 --> 49:11.049
What for?

49:11.149 --> 49:15.386
She said that she had something
important to do.

49:15.486 --> 49:17.873
But she never came back.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.376
But I can't blame her.

49:22.656 --> 49:25.413
I'd stayed away from her, too.

49:26.326 --> 49:30.035
Being around her was just so hard for me.

49:32.431 --> 49:34.801
I guess that must be
what it's like to be around me.

49:34.901 --> 49:37.189
Don't say that.

49:38.369 --> 49:40.171
Now...

49:40.271 --> 49:44.154
why do you think that it's your father
that's haunting this house?

49:44.574 --> 49:49.164
The other day the record player
went off by itself and it was playing this.

49:49.810 --> 49:52.647
My father used to play this record
all the time when I was little.

49:52.747 --> 49:55.035
It was his favorite.

49:56.382 --> 50:00.607
No... this wasn't your father's favorite.

50:02.954 --> 50:06.977
- It was your mother's.
- My mother's?

50:08.424 --> 50:11.464
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

50:15.462 --> 50:17.751
I'll go get that.

50:23.903 --> 50:27.140
Then he arrived around six. Hello.

50:27.240 --> 50:30.795
- Hey. What brings you back?
- Well...

50:32.709 --> 50:35.498
We found this in Nina's pocket.

50:37.245 --> 50:40.415
- This belong to you?
- It wasn't Nina's?

50:40.515 --> 50:43.137
It's a big rock. Kind of expensive.

50:44.350 --> 50:47.406
- Does it look familiar?
- Should it?

50:48.419 --> 50:50.875
I guess not.

50:51.454 --> 50:55.108
- It could always be Elizabeth's.
- That's your father's second wife?

50:55.208 --> 50:57.677
Girlfriend. He never married the bitch.

50:57.977 --> 51:00.880
Okay, I guess I better go see her next.

51:00.980 --> 51:04.152
- Thank you, see you soon.
- Yeah, you too.

51:11.505 --> 51:14.175
So about that record...

51:14.275 --> 51:16.777
That ring definitely
didn't seem familiar to you?

51:16.877 --> 51:18.515
No.

51:26.384 --> 51:28.640
What are you looking for?

51:28.953 --> 51:31.422
The keys to the storage.

51:32.122 --> 51:33.923
What for?

51:34.023 --> 51:36.593
Tom took my dad's stuff
to the storage, and...

51:36.693 --> 51:39.996
- I need a photo album from there.
- What photo album?

51:40.096 --> 51:42.698
It's this old, green one
from when I was little.

51:42.798 --> 51:45.733
- There's lots of pictures of mom in it.
- But whatever for?

51:45.833 --> 51:50.337
I just really need it. Would you mind going down
to the storage place and getting it for me?

51:50.437 --> 51:54.407
- No, I guess... I guess not.
- Thank you so much, Aunt Margie.

51:54.507 --> 51:58.797
I think I'm finally gonna be able to prove
to everyone that I'm not imagining things.

52:14.622 --> 52:16.444
Faye.

52:24.596 --> 52:28.453
- Faye, It's me!
- I'm in the office!

52:33.269 --> 52:35.892
I am so sorry.

52:39.406 --> 52:41.858
I came as fast as I could.

52:42.908 --> 52:45.477
- You look so pretty.
- Yeah?

52:45.577 --> 52:49.980
I was going to meet someone on a date,
when Tom called and told me what happened.

52:50.080 --> 52:54.484
- You canceled your date for me?
- Considering what happened? Absolutely.

52:54.584 --> 52:56.986
You shouldn't have.
Aunt Margie came to stay with me.

52:57.086 --> 53:01.589
I couldn't not come. Where is she anyways?

53:01.689 --> 53:05.077
She went to the storage place
to get something for me.

53:06.291 --> 53:09.515
You seem to be doing okay, considering.

53:10.662 --> 53:12.764
Are you finally working
on your dissertation?

53:12.864 --> 53:16.867
No, I'm trying to find the footage of
whatever triggered the alarm last night.

53:16.967 --> 53:19.536
Someone broke into your house last night?

53:19.636 --> 53:22.571
That's the thing. There was no break in.
Only the inside sensors went off.

53:22.671 --> 53:24.892
I don't get it.

53:29.009 --> 53:31.377
- Oh, my God!
- What is it?

53:31.477 --> 53:34.215
Come here. Look at this.

53:35.545 --> 53:39.602
- Who is that?
- More like, what is that?

53:40.465 --> 53:42.084
Have you ever seen anyone
move that quickly?

53:42.184 --> 53:44.186
It's the recording
that makes it look that fast, right?

53:44.286 --> 53:48.556
No, no. See, the timer says that thing
moved across the room in three seconds.

53:48.656 --> 53:52.358
- That thing?
- The ghost.

53:52.458 --> 53:54.213
Right.

53:54.359 --> 53:57.416
Tom told me. Your father's ghost.

53:58.162 --> 54:00.451
I'm back!

54:04.700 --> 54:08.104
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hi, Margie, pleasure to see you.

54:08.204 --> 54:11.351
- Special delivery.
- Thank you so much.

54:15.742 --> 54:18.145
I knew it! The ring was my mother's.

54:18.245 --> 54:22.014
You're right! It's been so long since
I've seen it, I forgot what it looked like.

54:22.114 --> 54:25.748
- What's going on?
- The ghost isn't my father.

54:25.848 --> 54:27.302
- It's my mother.
- You think so?

54:27.402 --> 54:30.836
- You don't know if your mother's dead.
- Nina found this ring in this house.

54:30.936 --> 54:33.356
- So?
- Why else would it be here?

54:33.456 --> 54:36.359
She must have come here
after she dropped you off at my house.

54:36.459 --> 54:39.228
Probably to confront my father
about Elizabeth.

54:39.328 --> 54:41.897
You have never known for a fact
that your father and Elizabeth

54:41.997 --> 54:43.431
were together before your mother left.

54:43.531 --> 54:48.020
Except that conveniently three months
later they were already living together.

54:49.700 --> 54:50.935
My father killed her.

54:51.035 --> 54:52.803
You're thinking your father
killed your mother?

54:52.903 --> 54:58.094
So she's the one haunting this house?
Where's my vodka?

54:58.973 --> 55:01.743
I can't believe that you are
encouraging this insanity.

55:01.843 --> 55:03.911
You saw the video.
What else do you need to believe me?

55:04.011 --> 55:06.103
- What video?
- So you're thinking your father killed

55:06.203 --> 55:10.235
- your mother because you found her ring.
- That's why he never wanted to come back here.

55:10.335 --> 55:14.484
That's why he wouldn't sell the house. He was
afraid that somebody was gonna find her body.

55:14.584 --> 55:18.588
Maybe she left the ring at the condo,
and your father brought it here.

55:18.688 --> 55:20.890
- Why would he do that?
- Why would he kill her?

55:20.990 --> 55:25.013
Can you say for sure that she was wearing
the ring the day she dropped off Faye?

55:25.426 --> 55:27.293
Not really.

55:27.393 --> 55:30.097
Then my explanation is as likely as any.

55:30.197 --> 55:33.099
What about everything else that's been
happening? I'm not imagining things.

55:33.199 --> 55:35.468
Has anyone else seen or heard
anything besides you?

55:35.568 --> 55:37.336
- No, but...
- What about Tom?

55:37.436 --> 55:39.638
All the nights he slept over,
he hasn't seen anything?

55:39.738 --> 55:42.123
- No.
- What about Nina?

55:42.223 --> 55:44.892
Did she ever say
that she had seen anything?

55:44.992 --> 55:47.861
No, but she was screaming
in the laundry room before she died.

55:47.961 --> 55:50.780
So she screamed out
when the window crushed her.

55:50.880 --> 55:53.447
That could've happened.

55:53.547 --> 55:56.115
- I thought you were on my side.
- I am.

55:56.215 --> 55:59.219
If she says she saw something,
I believe her.

55:59.319 --> 56:02.308
Let's see what Dr. Murphy and Tom believe.

56:05.923 --> 56:09.460
Doc, is it possible that one of
the medications that you prescribed Faye

56:09.560 --> 56:11.662
is causing her to have
these hallucinations?

56:11.762 --> 56:16.299
Hallucinations are not
a side effect of that drug.

56:16.399 --> 56:22.204
However, paranoia is a classic symptom
of underlying panic disorder.

56:22.304 --> 56:26.874
- But she's never been paranoid before.
- It's obviously a new symptom.

56:26.974 --> 56:29.526
So she's getting worse
instead of getting better?

56:29.626 --> 56:31.744
Stop talking about me
like I'm not in this room.

56:31.844 --> 56:35.381
Faye, everybody in this room
cares about you.

56:35.481 --> 56:39.585
- Is there anything else you can do?
- Well, I could prescribe a higher dosage,

56:39.685 --> 56:44.055
but that would require
24 hour medical supervision.

56:44.155 --> 56:46.456
A live-in nurse?

56:46.556 --> 56:49.527
A mental health institution.

56:50.127 --> 56:53.030
- For how long?
- For however long it takes.

56:53.130 --> 56:56.999
- And how long will that be?
- It's hard to predict these kinds of things.

56:57.099 --> 56:59.801
Oh, come on. We've all heard
the stories about these places.

56:59.901 --> 57:02.769
They just keep people drugged up,
and they are stuck there indefinitely.

57:02.869 --> 57:09.308
No. Patients that are in these places
need that kind of 24 hour care like that.

57:09.408 --> 57:14.232
And none of us has the training or
the time to be with her the whole day.

57:15.111 --> 57:16.816
I'll agree to it.

57:17.279 --> 57:19.565
But only if we take her
to Regional Hospital.

57:19.665 --> 57:21.550
But I don't work there.

57:21.650 --> 57:25.446
Exactly. I think it's time
that Faye finds a new doctor.

57:25.886 --> 57:28.088
Okay, you're making a big mistake.

57:28.188 --> 57:32.425
Finding a new doctor,
you would have to start all over again.

57:32.525 --> 57:35.227
You've been treating her for eight years,

57:35.327 --> 57:39.530
- and it doesn't seem to be helping.
- If anything, she's getting worse.

57:39.630 --> 57:44.133
- Margie, what do you think?
- Isn't anyone gonna ask what I think?

57:44.233 --> 57:46.335
Do you want a new doctor, sweetie?

57:46.435 --> 57:50.004
I don't need a new doctor.
I need you guys to believe me.

57:50.104 --> 57:52.639
You said yourself you didn't like
his idea of bringing her here.

57:52.739 --> 57:57.676
No, I'm getting better. I'm so close
to walking outside those doors.

57:57.776 --> 58:00.629
But you're developing new symptoms.

58:00.729 --> 58:02.517
No.

58:05.582 --> 58:08.519
I guess it is the right thing
for her right now.

58:09.119 --> 58:11.254
But I thought you believed me.

58:11.354 --> 58:16.592
If what you say is true, then that's
all the more reason to leave this house.

58:17.092 --> 58:19.281
There, you'll be safe.

58:22.896 --> 58:27.301
Babe... I love you more
than anything in the world.

58:27.401 --> 58:30.670
- We just want to see you get better.
- Faye, we will all help you.

58:30.770 --> 58:35.707
I can help Tom take care of your dad's
business for a few weeks until you're better.

58:35.807 --> 58:38.595
Yes, you can count on all of us.

58:39.274 --> 58:41.063
Well...

58:41.309 --> 58:45.581
if you guys don't want me to treat her...

58:45.981 --> 58:47.736
Here...

58:49.650 --> 58:54.396
You're gonna need these sedatives
for the long ride to Regional.

59:00.827 --> 59:03.183
Doc, it's not personal.

59:11.169 --> 59:13.491
Good luck, Faye.

59:15.839 --> 59:18.195
You know where to find me.

59:38.694 --> 59:42.098
If you're staying here tonight,
then I'll go ahead and leave.

59:42.198 --> 59:45.101
Are you sure?
It's gonna start raining soon.

59:45.201 --> 59:47.022
I'll manage.

59:52.238 --> 59:54.660
I'll see you tomorrow, sweetie.

01:00:02.545 --> 01:00:04.448
Call me when you're about a...

01:00:04.548 --> 01:00:07.537
half hour away,
and I'll meet you at the hospital.

01:00:14.155 --> 01:00:17.278
I'll go with you guys
to the hospital in the morning.

01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:34.107
You need something to help you sleep?

01:00:34.207 --> 01:00:37.810
- I'm afraid to go to sleep.
- Why, baby?

01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:40.679
What if something happens to me
in my sleep, and I can't wake up?

01:00:40.779 --> 01:00:43.868
Faye, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

01:00:47.850 --> 01:00:50.073
Here, take one.

01:00:57.992 --> 01:01:00.348
I'm gonna go check on Stephanie.

01:01:33.457 --> 01:01:35.358
Mom...

01:01:35.458 --> 01:01:40.563
if it's really you... I'm sorry
for whatever happened here.

01:01:40.663 --> 01:01:44.666
Just please don't hurt me tonight,
or Tom or Stephanie.

01:01:44.766 --> 01:01:47.502
They're the people I care about
most in this world.

01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:51.058
And I promise we'll leave
this house by tomorrow morning.

01:02:22.901 --> 01:02:26.505
- What a night.
- What are we gonna do about this house?

01:02:26.605 --> 01:02:29.707
- What do you mean?
- It's too far for anyone to live here.

01:02:29.807 --> 01:02:32.109
It's a two hour drive to the hospital,

01:02:32.209 --> 01:02:35.545
and it's too pricey
to keep as a weekend retreat.

01:02:35.645 --> 01:02:38.667
Let me guess... you want the listing?

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:46.240
<i>Faye, wake up.</i>

01:03:09.441 --> 01:03:11.297
<i>Faye.</i>

01:03:12.577 --> 01:03:15.113
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:03:15.213 --> 01:03:16.647
I heard a noise.

01:03:16.747 --> 01:03:19.736
- What kind of noise?
- Something moving upstairs.

01:03:21.417 --> 01:03:23.886
Oh, God, not you too.

01:03:23.986 --> 01:03:27.572
I'm serious. Maybe Faye is awake.
You should go check on her.

01:03:27.672 --> 01:03:31.292
She took one of her pills. She's out
like a light for the next eight hours.

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:33.881
I could have sworn I heard a voice.

01:03:57.715 --> 01:03:59.317
<i>This way.</i>

01:03:59.417 --> 01:04:03.354
- I definitely heard something.
- I swear, I'm surrounded by paranoid women.

01:04:03.654 --> 01:04:05.322
I'm gonna check on Faye.
She might be awake.

01:04:05.422 --> 01:04:09.778
- She's dead to the world right now.
- Well, I'm gonna go just in case.

01:04:11.525 --> 01:04:14.882
I told you, she's asleep right now.

01:04:16.162 --> 01:04:20.333
- Are you crazy? Not here.
- Why not? We can do it right here.

01:04:20.433 --> 01:04:24.356
We're so close, all right?
Let's not mess it up now.

01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:30.308
You're just still pissed
about the pregnancy.

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.810
Of course, I'm still pissed.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.296
Steph, with all the drugs she's on,
she's never in the mood.

01:04:36.396 --> 01:04:37.597
It's the truth.

01:04:37.747 --> 01:04:40.583
Then how'd the baby happen?
Immaculate conception?

01:04:40.683 --> 01:04:43.285
I didn't said we never had sex,
just not that often.

01:04:43.385 --> 01:04:45.720
We've been married
for three years for Christ's sake!

01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.322
You just never enjoyed it, right?

01:04:48.422 --> 01:04:53.046
You know, I'm getting tired of your shit.
This whole scheme was your idea.

01:04:53.426 --> 01:04:56.832
How did you think I was gonna be able
to pull this off if we didn't have sex?

01:04:57.162 --> 01:05:00.298
I know, I know. I just...

01:05:00.798 --> 01:05:04.599
I never counted on how hard this
was gonna be to see you guys together.

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:06.670
Hey.

01:05:06.770 --> 01:05:10.872
Come tomorrow, it's just gonna be
the two of us, all right?

01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:15.286
And 30 million dollars at our disposal.

01:05:16.809 --> 01:05:21.047
It's not gonna to be that easy, though.
I have to get a doctor to declare her insane.

01:05:21.147 --> 01:05:23.516
Then I have to get appointed
as her legal guardian.

01:05:23.616 --> 01:05:26.685
With her insisting
that she's seeing ghosts,

01:05:26.785 --> 01:05:29.399
that shouldn't be a problem.

01:05:29.499 --> 01:05:34.073
I have to say... the mats,
the shoes, the cat stew...

01:05:34.173 --> 01:05:38.452
- that was brilliant.
- The cat stew was Nina's idea.

01:05:38.552 --> 01:05:41.378
Too risky for me. What if Faye had come in
when she was switching the pots?

01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:45.198
We had to get rid of that cat.
It was actually helping her get better.

01:05:45.298 --> 01:05:46.749
Poor Hamlet.

01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:49.752
But what really put the nail in the coffin

01:05:49.902 --> 01:05:52.671
was that shadow on the security video.

01:05:52.771 --> 01:05:55.608
How did you do that?

01:05:55.972 --> 01:05:59.509
- What shadow?
- The one Faye showed me from last night.

01:05:59.609 --> 01:06:02.097
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:06:02.743 --> 01:06:07.981
Must have been Nina, then.
I told her to pull out all the stops.

01:06:08.081 --> 01:06:11.236
But Nina died before the alarm went off.

01:06:12.649 --> 01:06:16.186
Well, it's too bad about Nina, then.

01:06:16.286 --> 01:06:18.421
One less person to share the money with.

01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:21.009
One less loose end.

01:06:27.727 --> 01:06:30.964
I can't believe that in less than 24 hours,
I'll finally be free of her.

01:06:31.064 --> 01:06:33.592
I can't believe it's taken three years.

01:06:36.333 --> 01:06:39.487
You know, in the end though,
I feel sorry for her.

01:06:40.337 --> 01:06:41.631
Really?

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:45.507
Yeah, I'm pretty sure that she does
need to be in a mental institution.

01:06:45.607 --> 01:06:48.376
Whatever makes you feel
better about all this.

01:06:48.576 --> 01:06:51.031
Let's celebrate early.

01:07:03.286 --> 01:07:05.041
I heard that.

01:07:12.093 --> 01:07:15.129
- Shit, she heard us.
- Great!

01:07:15.229 --> 01:07:17.598
I thought you said she was asleep.

01:07:17.698 --> 01:07:20.601
You know, no one's going to believe her.
They think she's crazy.

01:07:20.701 --> 01:07:23.070
We can't take that chance.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:25.525
Then what do we do?

01:07:30.976 --> 01:07:33.713
- She has to die.
- What?

01:07:33.813 --> 01:07:36.148
It won't be that hard.
We just make it look like a suicide.

01:07:36.248 --> 01:07:38.383
We can't kill her.

01:07:38.483 --> 01:07:41.786
If she's alive and then divorces me,
we get nothing.

01:07:41.886 --> 01:07:44.908
Her dad made me sign a pre-nup, remember?

01:07:48.957 --> 01:07:51.345
What do you wanna do?

01:07:52.725 --> 01:07:56.196
We tie her up.
Make her take an overdose of pills.

01:07:56.896 --> 01:07:59.685
At least we know she can't go very far.

01:08:14.344 --> 01:08:16.867
You wanna tie her up with that?

01:08:25.955 --> 01:08:27.711
Faye.

01:08:36.098 --> 01:08:40.402
Come on out, Faye.
We all know you're not going anywhere.

01:08:40.502 --> 01:08:45.073
Faye, come on out
and talk to us about this.

01:08:45.573 --> 01:08:48.442
I'm sorry, Faye.
Come on, nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:08:48.542 --> 01:08:53.145
Forgive me, Faye. I was just always
so jealous of you in school.

01:08:53.245 --> 01:08:58.569
I let the money cloud my judgment, Faye.
Please. Hon?

01:09:02.751 --> 01:09:05.774
You scream out as soon as you see her.

01:09:28.042 --> 01:09:29.764
Faye?

01:09:31.478 --> 01:09:33.901
I'm so sorry, Faye...

01:09:34.714 --> 01:09:38.671
but you've no idea how hard
this has been for me.

01:09:39.951 --> 01:09:42.541
Always by your side.

01:09:44.121 --> 01:09:46.777
Always taking care of you.

01:09:47.656 --> 01:09:51.148
Come on out. Talk to us.

01:09:52.292 --> 01:09:54.014
Please.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.322
Faye?

01:10:07.471 --> 01:10:09.360
Faye.

01:10:15.844 --> 01:10:18.500
You know, this isn't Tom's fault.

01:10:21.181 --> 01:10:24.638
I'm the one who told him
about your father being ill.

01:10:39.731 --> 01:10:41.834
All he had to do was...

01:10:41.934 --> 01:10:44.883
act like a courier so he could meet you.

01:10:56.179 --> 01:10:59.169
You know, I really do think
he fell for you.

01:11:00.549 --> 01:11:02.805
So you see...

01:11:03.284 --> 01:11:05.774
you beat me again.

01:11:33.879 --> 01:11:35.768
Faye?

01:13:59.346 --> 01:14:02.336
Faye... it wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

01:14:02.436 --> 01:14:04.517
You were supposed
to just go get the help you needed.

01:14:04.617 --> 01:14:07.720
- I offered you all my money.
- Don't think I didn't consider it.

01:14:07.820 --> 01:14:10.423
- Certainly a lot less work than all this.
- Then why?

01:14:10.523 --> 01:14:14.125
It would mean being cooped up in here
with you for the rest of my life.

01:14:14.925 --> 01:14:17.410
So you preferred to just drive me crazy?

01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:19.145
I hate to break it to you, sweetheart,

01:14:19.295 --> 01:14:23.018
but you've been bat-shit crazy
since the day I met you.

01:14:26.066 --> 01:14:30.073
Look at you, Faye. You finally did it!

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:32.942
Too bad that's as far as you're gonna go.

01:14:37.843 --> 01:14:42.166
Well, I guess you were right, Faye.
You are getting better.

01:14:42.945 --> 01:14:45.902
Maybe I should have taken you up
on that offer, Faye.

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:51.320
Lord knows the sex wasn't half bad.
I was the best you've ever had.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.240
Wait, what am I thinking?
I was the only one you've ever had.

01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:58.375
How are you going to explain
Stephanie's body?

01:15:02.159 --> 01:15:04.415
Murder-suicide.

01:15:10.065 --> 01:15:12.520
Poor, poor Faye.

01:15:15.036 --> 01:15:18.349
Is it too late to take you up
on that offer, Faye?

01:15:18.740 --> 01:15:20.909
I mean, just look at you.

01:15:21.009 --> 01:15:23.864
You could be running marathons now.

01:15:25.411 --> 01:15:28.367
We could have a beautiful life together.

01:15:45.061 --> 01:15:47.483
Think about it, Faye.

01:15:47.762 --> 01:15:52.220
Who else are you going to find who's going
to put up with all your little... problems.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:57.023
What we had was something special.

01:16:27.798 --> 01:16:32.069
Angel face? You know I still love you.

01:16:32.569 --> 01:16:35.059
Give me another chance, Faye.

01:17:41.931 --> 01:17:44.351
I had these in Jamaica once.

01:17:45.401 --> 01:17:46.722
Cheers.

01:17:49.603 --> 01:17:51.305
So...

01:17:51.405 --> 01:17:53.554
have you seen or heard her again?

01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:55.642
I think her work is done.

01:17:55.742 --> 01:17:59.245
I just can't believe they found
her body all cut into pieces.

01:17:59.645 --> 01:18:01.666
I know.

01:18:03.279 --> 01:18:05.749
I was so afraid of her,

01:18:05.849 --> 01:18:08.538
when all she was trying to do
was to warn me about them.

01:18:11.186 --> 01:18:14.842
Oh, I'll get it. Used to it.

01:18:20.660 --> 01:18:24.530
- Detective! Come in.
- Hello. Thank you.

01:18:24.630 --> 01:18:27.733
Join us. Would you like a drink?

01:18:27.833 --> 01:18:30.135
No, thank you,
I'm here on official business.

01:18:30.235 --> 01:18:33.371
Well, I think mine
needs a little more rum.

01:18:33.471 --> 01:18:35.973
- Hello.
- Come on, sit down for a minute.

01:18:36.073 --> 01:18:38.194
Thank you.

01:18:39.641 --> 01:18:44.079
Okay. I wanted to tell you
the Medical Examiner's report...

01:18:44.179 --> 01:18:48.116
on those bones that we found buried
next your husband's body came back.

01:18:48.216 --> 01:18:52.105
And the DNA proves that they
definitely belonged to your mother.

01:18:52.818 --> 01:18:55.955
- I already knew that.
- You did?

01:18:56.055 --> 01:18:59.224
You think your father's girlfriend
had something to do with it?

01:18:59.324 --> 01:19:02.847
- You'll have to ask her that.
- Well, we definitely will.

01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:06.515
Let me ask you something.

01:19:06.794 --> 01:19:09.418
Are you ever gonna tell me
what really happened here?

01:19:15.702 --> 01:19:19.273
Do you believe
in the supernatural, Detective?

01:19:19.373 --> 01:19:23.209
The supernatural?
Like ghosts and things like that?

01:19:23.309 --> 01:19:25.497
Put it this way.

01:19:25.976 --> 01:19:29.733
The spirits of our loved ones,
they watch over us.

01:19:30.579 --> 01:19:33.469
I'd really like to believe that.

01:19:42.455 --> 01:19:44.277
Hamlet!

01:19:48.893 --> 01:19:53.564
Oh, my gosh. Hamlet, my baby.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:57.167
Oh, I missed you so much. Are you okay?

01:19:57.267 --> 01:20:00.423
Are you okay? Look at mommy. Oh, my gosh.

01:20:25.725 --> 01:20:27.861
<i>I don't know what else
you want me to try, Elizabeth.</i>

01:20:27.961 --> 01:20:31.264
- Really?
- <i>No, there's no way.</i>

01:20:31.364 --> 01:20:36.267
I don't think so. I don't want to hear
any more excuses. You find a way.

01:20:36.367 --> 01:20:40.404
I didn't spend the best years of my life with
that man to be tossed aside with nothing.

01:20:40.504 --> 01:20:41.538
