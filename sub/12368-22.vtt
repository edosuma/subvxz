00:03.670 --> 00:06.965
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:07.048 --> 00:11.136
OH, BIDDING ON ABANDONED
STORAGE UNITS.

00:11.219 --> 00:15.765
WE'VE COME A LONG WAY
FROM RODEO DRIVE.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.142
- I HOPE THEY START SOON.

00:17.225 --> 00:19.602
THIS PLACE SMELLS
LIKE WORN-OUT MATTRESSES.

00:19.686 --> 00:23.940
- OH, YOU MUST FEEL
RIGHT AT HOME.

00:24.023 --> 00:25.775
- OH, MY GOD.
IT IS YOU.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.485
[laughs]
CAN I HAVE YOUR AUTOGRAPH?

00:27.569 --> 00:30.947
- I CAN'T GO ANYWHERE.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.408
SURE. HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.826
VICTORIA CHASE.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.077
OH, I WAS HOPING
YOU'D SIGN IT

00:36.161 --> 00:39.456

00:41.666 --> 00:44.627
BUT YOU'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT?

00:44.711 --> 00:46.004

00:46.087 --> 00:47.380
UH, I TAKE IT

00:49.048 --> 00:50.508
- WHAT?
- YEAH.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.635
MY KIDS LOVE IT.
THEY LAUGH.

00:52.719 --> 00:53.928
THEY'RE LIKE,
"THAT LADY'S WEARING DIAPERS!"

00:54.012 --> 00:56.431
- UH--

00:56.514 --> 00:57.974
THEY ARE NOT DIAPERS.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.643
THEY ARE STYLISH PANTS
FOR WOMEN ON THE GO

01:00.727 --> 01:01.686
WHO CAN'T STOP TO GO.

01:01.770 --> 01:02.854
- [laughs]

01:02.937 --> 01:06.941
I LOVE IT
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.985
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

01:09.068 --> 01:10.320
THOSE COMMERCIALS
WERE NEVER SUPPOSED TO AIR

01:10.403 --> 01:11.446
IN THE U.S.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.822
- OH, COME ON, VICTORIA.

01:12.906 --> 01:13.990
YOU GOTTA HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR ABOUT THIS.

01:14.073 --> 01:15.450
- A DRY SENSE OF HUMOR.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.660
[laughter]

01:17.744 --> 01:19.162
- ALL RIGHT, FOLKS.
IT'S AUCTION TIME.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.413
WE'RE GONNA OPEN THE DOORS

01:20.497 --> 01:23.500

01:23.583 --> 01:24.501
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU CAN'T GO INSIDE.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.376
YOU CAN'T OPEN ANY BOXES.

AND WHOSEVER GOT
THE MOST MONEY TODAY

01:26.878 --> 01:27.837
CAN CERTAINLY OWN IT.
ARE YOU READY?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.465
- WE KNOW HOW IT WORKS,
HAIRCUT.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.008
- ALL RIGHT, BOYS AND GIRLS,

01:32.091 --> 01:33.510
WE'RE GONNA START THE BIDDING

01:33.593 --> 01:35.178
AND HOW 'BOUT STARTING THAT ONE
OFF AT ABOUT 20 BUCKS

01:35.261 --> 01:36.387

WHAT ABOUT 20?

01:36.471 --> 01:37.305
NOW 25, NOW 25,
WHAT ABOUT 25?

01:37.388 --> 01:38.890
- 25, THE YOUNG LADY
IN THE TRACK SUIT.

01:38.973 --> 01:40.683
DO I HEAR 30?

01:40.767 --> 01:42.185
- OH, WOW,
LOOK AT THAT PAINTING.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.812
KIND OF LOOKS LIKE A MONET.

01:43.895 --> 01:45.021
- [gasps]
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:45.104 --> 01:47.148
HEY, IF I FOUND
A FAMOUS PAINTING,

01:47.232 --> 01:48.650
THEN THE MEDIA WOULD BE
ALL OVER IT, RIGHT?

01:48.733 --> 01:49.859
AND THEN
MY WHOLE LADYPANTS THING

01:49.943 --> 01:50.860
WOULD BE FORGOTTEN.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.904
BUT I GOTTA PLAY IT COOL.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.698
$3,000!

01:55.782 --> 01:57.992

01:58.076 --> 02:00.912
- SOMEBODY'S GOT
LADYPANTS MONEY.

02:13.132 --> 02:14.509
- NO, I'M AFRAID
THIS ISN'T A MONET.

02:14.592 --> 02:17.178
{\an8}ALTHOUGH THE ARTIST'S SIGNATURE
LOOKS FRENCH,

02:17.262 --> 02:19.222
{\an8}SO IT COULD BE WORTH
SOME "MOH-NAY".

02:19.305 --> 02:20.557
{\an8}[laughs]

02:20.640 --> 02:22.809
{\an8}SORRY. IT'S HOT IN HERE.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.186
{\an8}- WHAT'S THIS?

02:25.270 --> 02:28.064
{\an8}- OH, THAT'S A C.B. RADIO,
GOOD BUDDY.

02:28.147 --> 02:29.732
{\an8}FOR SOME REASON,
EVERYONE IN THE '70s

02:29.816 --> 02:31.568
{\an8}WANTED TO TALK TO TRUCKERS.

02:31.651 --> 02:35.613
{\an8}- OH, NOW WE'RE TALKING.

02:35.697 --> 02:39.075
{\an8}LOOK AT THIS UGLY-ASS THING.

02:39.158 --> 02:41.536
{\an8}- WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU WANT
A HALF-KNITTED SWEATER?

02:41.619 --> 02:43.413
{\an8}- EVERY YEAR,
THE SENIOR CENTER HAS

02:43.496 --> 02:46.249
{\an8}A CONTEST FOR THE MOST
UGLY-ASS CHRISTMAS SWEATER.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.128
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.422
{\an8}A MARK JORDAN BUST DEVELOPER.

02:52.505 --> 02:54.090
{\an8}- I HAD ONE OF THOSE.

02:54.173 --> 02:56.426
{\an8}OH, GOD, I WANTED BOOBS
SO BADLY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.219
{\an8}I THOUGHT EVERYTHING
WOULD BE PERFECT

02:58.303 --> 02:59.304
{\an8}AS SOON AS I GOT THEM.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.764
{\an8}- I THOUGHT THAT TOO.

03:01.848 --> 03:05.393
{\an8}AND I WAS RIGHT.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.770
{\an8}BREAKER, BREAKER.

03:07.854 --> 03:11.399
{\an8}THIS IS CANDY CANE
FROM THE BIG DIRTY.

03:11.482 --> 03:12.609
{\an8}COME ON BACK.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.069
{\an8}- OH, GOOD LORD.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.571
{\an8}- YOU'RE MISSING
THE BEAUTY OF THIS.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.655
{\an8}- WHICH IS?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.574
{\an8}- YOU'RE ANONYMOUS.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.784
{\an8}YOU CAN PRETEND TO BE ANYBODY
YOU WANT TO BE.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.412
{\an8}- SO WHO'S CANDY CANE?

03:24.495 --> 03:26.164
{\an8}- I'M A SAUCY LITTLE REDHEAD

03:26.247 --> 03:31.085
{\an8}WHO DOES TASTEFUL
SOFT-CORE PORN...

03:31.169 --> 03:35.757
{\an8}UH, FROM A LADY'S
POINT OF VIEW.

03:35.840 --> 03:38.176
- WELL, UM,
I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED

03:38.259 --> 03:39.636
WHAT MY LIFE
WOULD'VE BEEN LIKE

03:39.719 --> 03:41.304
IF I'D STAYED IN COLLEGE.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.139
I HAD A CERTAIN FACILITY
FOR MATHEMATICS--

03:43.222 --> 03:46.476
LOGARITHMS, STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS, NUMBER THEORY.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.311
YOU KNOW,
LIKE IN <i> A BEAUTIFUL MIND.</i>

03:48.394 --> 03:51.147
- SNORE.

03:51.230 --> 03:54.609
THESE TRUCKERS AREN'T INTERESTED
IN BEAUTIFUL MINDS.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.778
YOU NEED SOMETHING VISUAL.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.326
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN CALL YOURSELF
A FINE ART APPRAISER?

04:03.409 --> 04:04.827
YEAH, WELL, I KNOW ART,

04:04.911 --> 04:06.371
BECAUSE I PLAYED
A BLOCKED ARTIST

04:06.454 --> 04:08.957
IN THE LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE

04:09.040 --> 04:12.877
<i>THE EMPTY PAINTBRUSH.</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:14.796
YES, YES,
I AM VICTORIA CHASE.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.380
I--

04:16.464 --> 04:18.966
NO, I AM NOT GOING
RIGHT NOW.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.514
THE APPRAISER SAYS
THAT THE PAINTING IS WORTHLESS,

04:24.597 --> 04:27.642
MUCH LIKE MY REPUTATION
AS A SERIOUS ACTRESS.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.018
NOW WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

04:29.102 --> 04:31.187
- WAIT. LOOK AT THIS.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.689
THERE'S SOMETHING
BEHIND THE FRAME.

04:32.772 --> 04:33.856
IT'S AN OLD ENVELOPE.

04:33.940 --> 04:35.149
[gasps]

04:35.233 --> 04:36.067
MAYBE WE STUMBLED
ON A MYSTERY.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.235
I LOVE MYSTERIES.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.153
DIDN'T YOU JUST LOVE
NANCY DREW?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.905
I WANTED TO DRIVE AROUND
IN A RED ROADSTER

04:40.989 --> 04:43.992
WITH MY BOYFRIEND,
NED NICKERSON.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.368
ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T REALLY SEEM
THAT INTO NANCY,

04:45.451 --> 04:46.327
DID HE?

04:46.411 --> 04:47.704
COME TO THINK OF IT,
HE WAS PROBABLY GAY,

04:47.787 --> 04:49.497
WASN'T HE?

04:49.580 --> 04:51.040
NOW, THAT'S THE MYSTERY
SHE SHOULD'VE SOLVED.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.501
- WILL YOU GIVE ME THAT?

04:53.584 --> 04:56.170
ALL RIGHT,
IT'S TO A WILLIAM HERNDON

04:56.254 --> 04:57.714
FROM A. LINCOLN,

04:57.797 --> 05:01.551
1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE,
WASHINGTON, D.C.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.428
- OH, MY G--

05:03.511 --> 05:04.846
THAT'S PRESIDENT LINCOLN!

05:04.929 --> 05:06.055
- WELL, IT SAYS "A" LINCOLN.

05:06.139 --> 05:08.891
WE DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S "THE" LINCOLN.

05:08.975 --> 05:10.977
- HONEY, WHO ELSE
COULD IT BE?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.770
LOOK, THE POSTMARK.
IT'S 1862.

05:12.854 --> 05:16.065
THIS IS AN UNDISCOVERED LETTER
FROM ABRAHAM LINCOLN.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.525
- OH!

05:17.608 --> 05:19.444
DO YOU REALIZE
WHAT THIS MEANS, MELANIE?

05:19.527 --> 05:22.864
THIS WILL ECLIPSE
THAT HUMILIATING COMMERCIAL.

05:22.947 --> 05:25.616
OH, LINCOLN HAS RELEASED ME
FROM THE SHACKLES

05:25.700 --> 05:28.244
OF MRS. LADYPANTS.

05:28.327 --> 05:32.582
I AM FREE AT LAST.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.125
- WE MUST, WE MUST,

05:34.208 --> 05:36.252
WE MUST INCREASE OUR BUST.

05:36.335 --> 05:37.879
THE BIGGER, THE BETTER,
THE TIGHTER THE SWEATER.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.423
THE BOYS DEPEND ON US.

05:45.178 --> 05:47.930
- [man over radio]
HEY, ANYBODY OUT THERE?

05:51.017 --> 05:54.771
- UM, BREAKITY-BREAK?

05:54.854 --> 05:57.482
- COME ON BACK.
THIS IS KEROUAC COWBOY.

05:57.565 --> 05:59.901
- HELLO, KEROUAC COWBOY.

05:59.984 --> 06:01.944
KEROUAC LIKE THE WRITER?

06:02.028 --> 06:04.614
- I'M A FAN.
AND WHO'S THIS?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.616
- THIS IS...

06:06.699 --> 06:09.160
ENGLISH ROSE.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.620
- AH, LIKE THE YEATS POEM,

06:10.703 --> 06:14.457
"RED ROSE, PROUD ROSE,
SAD ROSE OF ALL MY DAYS."

06:14.540 --> 06:15.958
- OH, I LOVE YEATS.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.627
BUT I'M NOT A RED ROSE.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.462
I'M A BRUNETTE.

06:19.545 --> 06:20.755
- ME TOO.

06:20.838 --> 06:21.798
AND JUST TO PROLONG
THE METAPHOR,

06:21.881 --> 06:24.884
I'M LONG-STEMMED.

06:26.844 --> 06:27.804
MEANING TALL.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.305
- OH.
[laughs]

06:29.388 --> 06:30.723
ME TOO.

06:30.807 --> 06:35.353
AND I ALSO...

06:35.436 --> 06:39.315
HAVE REALLY LARGE BREASTS.

06:39.398 --> 06:43.402
CRAZY LARGE.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.655
HELLO?
KEROUAC COWBOY?

06:45.738 --> 06:48.866
- UH, I'M HERE.

06:48.950 --> 06:50.952
- I'M SORRY,
I'M JUST LETTING YOU KNOW

06:51.035 --> 06:53.830
BECAUSE SOME GUYS
DON'T LIKE LARGE BREASTS,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.665
WHICH IS TOO BAD,
BECAUSE I HAVE 'EM.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.668
BIG TIME.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.669
- WELL, YOU'RE IN LUCK.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.837
I KNOW A GUY
WHO LOVES 'EM.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.839
HANG ON, HE'S RIGHT HERE.

07:02.922 --> 07:05.675
[same voice]
HELLOOO.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.681
- OH, CAN'T WE TAKE
A PEEK INSIDE?

07:11.764 --> 07:13.015
- NO.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.308
WE HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE LINCOLN EXPERT

07:14.392 --> 07:15.309
FROM THE UNIVERSITY
TO GET HERE.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.396
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.528
- WELL, WE DON'T NEED
A LINCOLN EXPERT

07:25.611 --> 07:29.198
TO SEE THAT WE'VE ENTERED
THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.616
- OH, IT'S JUST A WATER BRA.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.702
I PICKED A FEW UP
AT THE MALL.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.203
I SAID THEY WERE
FOR A FRIEND,

07:34.287 --> 07:35.580
BUT I WORE ONE
OUT OF THE STORE,

07:35.663 --> 07:37.373
SO I THINK THEY KNEW
I WAS LYING.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.792
- IS THIS RELATED
TO YOUR C.B. BUDDY?

07:39.876 --> 07:40.918
- WELL, YES.

07:41.002 --> 07:43.379
THE WHOLE THING GOT ME THINKING
ABOUT HOW IT WOULD FEEL

07:43.462 --> 07:45.047
IF I REALLY LOOKED
LIKE THE PERSON

07:45.131 --> 07:46.174
I WAS DEPICTING.

07:46.257 --> 07:50.136
SO FAR THESE "D"s
GET AN "A".

07:50.219 --> 07:52.096
THEY GOT ME
OUT OF A TICKET TODAY.

07:52.180 --> 07:54.056
- YEAH, BUT DON'T YOU
USUALLY GET OUT OF TICKETS?

07:54.140 --> 07:57.059
- YES, BUT THIS WAS FOR SPEEDING
AND A BROKEN TAIL LIGHT.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.436
NOTHING LIKE HEADLIGHTS

07:58.519 --> 08:01.480
TO GET OUT
OF A BROKEN TAIL LIGHT.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.777
AH, BOOBS ARE MAKING ME
WITTIER, TOO.

08:06.861 --> 08:09.071
- NO, BOOBS ONLY MAKE YOU
WITTIER TO MEN.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.573
- THEY SURE DO.

08:10.656 --> 08:12.575
THE GUYS AT THE AUTO SHOP
SAID I WAS AS FUNNY

08:12.658 --> 08:14.076
AS SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.120
- YEAH, I DON'T THINK
OF SCARLETT JOHANSSON AS FUNNY.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.288
- NO.

08:17.371 --> 08:18.581
- SHE'S NOT.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.041
BUT SHE'S HOT,
AND THEY COMPARED ME TO HER,

08:20.124 --> 08:21.667
SO I'M HAPPY.

08:21.751 --> 08:22.919
[doorbell rings]

08:23.002 --> 08:25.755
- OH, GOOD.
THERE'S OUR LINCOLN EXPERT.

08:28.633 --> 08:30.593
ARTIE, WHAT ARE YOU

08:30.676 --> 08:32.260

08:36.682 --> 08:39.101
- OH, NO.
YOU'RE THE LINCOLN EXPERT?

08:39.184 --> 08:41.229
- I WAS ONCE A PROMISING
GRADUATE STUDENT,

08:41.312 --> 08:44.482
UNTIL MY BREAK WITH REALITY,
WHICH WE'RE ALL AWARE OF.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.067
BUT NOW,
THANKS TO POWERFUL MEDICINES,

08:46.150 --> 08:48.778
I AM BACK IN ACADEMIA,

08:48.861 --> 08:53.074

PRIVILEGES THAT IMPLIES.

08:53.157 --> 08:54.742
JOY.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.912
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT YOU.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.289
HAVE YOU GOTTEN FUNNIER?

09:00.373 --> 09:03.960
- YES. THANKS FOR NOTICING.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.962
- CAN WE GET
TO MY LETTER, PLEASE?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.339
- AS YOU WISH.

09:08.422 --> 09:13.427
AH, DEAR ABRAHAM,
WE MEET AGAIN.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.805
HUH. I-I'M TOO NERVOUS
TO DO THIS.

09:15.888 --> 09:18.266
- OH, GIVE ME THAT.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.976
[sighs]

09:20.059 --> 09:21.185
UH, WASHINGTON, D.C.,

09:21.269 --> 09:24.146
APRIL 16, 1862.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.648
"MY DEAR WILLIAM,

09:25.731 --> 09:27.316
HOW ARE THINGS BACK HOME?"

09:27.400 --> 09:29.443
UH, BLAH BLAH BLAH NORTH,

09:29.527 --> 09:30.653
BLAH BLAH BLAH SOUTH.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.197
UH...OH, HERE'S SOMETHING.

09:33.281 --> 09:36.993
"I HAVE A VEXING DILEMMA
OF A PERSONAL NATURE.

09:37.076 --> 09:39.120
"THERE IS A YOUNG WOMAN
WORKING HERE,

09:39.203 --> 09:40.496
"TAKING A YEAR OFF

09:40.579 --> 09:42.331
"FROM THE ILLINOIS SCHOOL
FOR THE FEMALE,

09:42.415 --> 09:44.041
"WITH WHOM I HAVE,

09:44.125 --> 09:46.168
"TO PUT IT IN THE MOST
DIRECT TERMS POSSIBLE,

09:46.252 --> 09:47.169
HAD RELATIONS WITH."

09:47.253 --> 09:49.171
OH, MY GOD!

09:49.255 --> 09:51.465
LINCOLN HAD AN AFFAIR
WITH AN INTERN!

09:51.549 --> 09:52.675
- NOT POSSIBLE.
- REALLY?

09:52.758 --> 09:54.677
I DON'T KNOW A LOT
ABOUT AMERICAN HISTORY,

09:54.760 --> 09:56.304
BUT CAN YOU EVEN
GET ELECTED

09:56.387 --> 10:00.141
IF YOU'RE NOT
A HORNY BASTARD?

10:00.224 --> 10:01.642
- THIS IS HUGE.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.227
THIS COULD BE
IN EVERY HISTORY BOOK

10:03.311 --> 10:04.312
FROM THIS DAY FORWARD.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.980
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.606
AND I'LL BE THE MEDIA DARLING
WHO RELEASED IT.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.693
GOOD-BYE, MRS. LADYPANTS.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.159
- WE ARE THE KNIGHTS
WHO SAY, "NI!"

10:18.242 --> 10:19.869
- [British accent]
YOU MUST BRING US A SHRUBBERY.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.163
[laughs]

10:22.246 --> 10:25.207
WOW, A SEXY GIRL
WHO CAN QUOTE MONTY PYTHON.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.251
YOU SHOULD RIDE WITH ME
SOMETIME, ENGLISH ROSE.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.503
- OH, I'D LOVE THAT.

10:29.587 --> 10:33.883
WOW.

10:33.966 --> 10:35.092
- WHAT?

10:35.176 --> 10:38.721
- OH, I-I'M JUST TOUCHING
MY BREASTS.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.681
WOW, THEY'RE SO SOFT.

10:40.765 --> 10:43.851
I CAN'T STOP PLAYING
WITH THEM.

10:43.934 --> 10:47.438
[crash]

10:47.521 --> 10:49.523
HELLO? HELLO?

10:49.607 --> 10:52.360
KEROUAC COWBOY?
COME ON BACK!

10:55.529 --> 10:57.573
BREAKER, BREAKER, LOOKING
FOR THE KEROUAC COWBOY.

10:57.656 --> 10:59.241
COME ON BACK.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.577
HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

11:01.660 --> 11:04.413
HOW DOES THIS CAR INFO
THING WORK?

11:04.497 --> 11:06.582
- STOP POKING MY NEW CAR.

11:06.665 --> 11:08.125
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO FIND OUT?

11:08.209 --> 11:10.127
- HOW MUCH FARTHER IT IS
TO THE TRUCK STOP

11:10.211 --> 11:11.712
HE WAS PASSING
WHEN HE CRASHED.

11:11.796 --> 11:15.716
- ENTUNE, FIND THE BUCKEYE
TRUCKER CAFE.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.596
- IT SAYS OUR DESTINATION
IS IN 0.8 MILES.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.266
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

11:24.350 --> 11:27.603
ENTUNE, IS THE KEROUAC COWBOY
MY DESTINY?

11:27.686 --> 11:29.647
- IT'S NOT A MAGIC 8 BALL.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.899
IT JUST FINDS THINGS
YOU NEED.

11:31.982 --> 11:36.153
- "THE NEAREST PSYCHIATRIC
FACILITY IS IN 20 MILES."

11:36.237 --> 11:38.906
- SEE?

11:38.989 --> 11:41.826
- WE JUST PASSED THE CAFE.

11:41.909 --> 11:43.744
AND THERE'S THE TRUCK.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.581
- DOESN'T LOOK TOO BAD.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.792
- OH, I GUESS I'M ACTUALLY
GOING TO MEET HIM.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.460
I'M NERVOUS.
HOW DO I LOOK?

11:51.544 --> 11:54.004
- LIKE AN IDIOT.

11:54.088 --> 11:57.007
TAKE THAT BRA OFF.
YOU DON'T NEED IT.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.093
- BUT I WANT TO APPEAR
AS ADVERTISED.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.679
- DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

12:01.762 --> 12:05.516
YOU'RE GORGEOUS
JUST THE WAY YOU ARE.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.476
- WOW.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.602
THANKS, ELKA.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.439
I KNOW YOU PRETEND
NOT TO LIKE ME,

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
BUT DEEP DOWN,
YOU REALLY DO.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.150
- OH, YEAH--OH.
- [laughing]

12:14.233 --> 12:15.818
- [grunts]

12:15.901 --> 12:19.405
- OH, MY GOD, ELKA!
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

12:19.488 --> 12:21.282
- I DIDN'T ASK YOU
TO HUG ME,

12:21.365 --> 12:22.950
YOU BONY NITWIT.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.201
HERE.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.078
- [screams]

12:29.248 --> 12:30.541
WHAT DO I DO?

12:30.624 --> 12:33.586
- MAYBE HE WON'T NOTICE.

12:40.050 --> 12:42.178
- EXCUSE ME!
KEROUAC COWBOY?

12:42.261 --> 12:44.513
- ENGLISH ROSE?
IS THAT YOU?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.141
- YES. I WAS WORRIED.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

12:47.224 --> 12:49.518
- OH, JUST SOME DAMAGE
TO THE TRUCK.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.813
MY C.B. WENT OUT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.901
WOW.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.861
YOU LOOK JUST LIKE
I PICTURED.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.989
- SO DO YOU.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.827
WOW.
YOU REALLY DO.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.746
- YOU SOUND SURPRISED.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.372
- WELL, I'VE BEEN TOLD
A LOT OF PEOPLE EXAGGERATE

13:10.456 --> 13:12.666
ON THE C.B.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.252
WHICH IS SO OKAY TO DO

13:15.336 --> 13:18.255
AND ACTUALLY EXPECTED
AND APPLAUDED.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.049
- YOU'RE FUNNY.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.427
LIKE SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.429
- I GET THAT A LOT.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.433
- YOU'VE, UH, GOT A THREAD.
MAY I?

13:29.517 --> 13:30.935
WHAT THE HELL?

13:31.018 --> 13:32.686
- I'M SORRY.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.730
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO LIVE UP TO MY DESCRIPTION.

13:34.813 --> 13:39.235
- REALLY? I CRASHED MY TRUCK
FOR BREASTS MADE OF YARN.

13:39.318 --> 13:40.569
- WELL, ONLY ONE
IS MADE OF YARN.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.907
THE OTHER'S MADE OF WATER.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.910
I'M NOT AS FUNNY NOW,
AM I?

13:47.993 --> 13:51.413
- I FEEL AS FRESH
AS MOUNT FUJI.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.959
FOR RELAXING TIMES,
MAKE IT LADYPANT TIME.

13:55.042 --> 13:57.211
OZAWA INDUSTRIAL BROTHERS,

13:57.294 --> 14:00.047
YOU ARE THE FRIEND
IN MY PANTS.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.758
I'M GOING RIGHT NOW.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.760
THIS IS WHY I HAVE TO RELEASE
THE LETTER.

14:04.843 --> 14:07.930
I CAN'T LET THIS BE
WHAT PEOPLE REMEMBER ME FOR.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.391
- GRANTED, IT'S EMBARRASSING.
BUT DON'T YOU SEE?

14:10.474 --> 14:15.145
YOU'RE DOING TO LINCOLN
WHAT LADYPANTS IS DOING TO YOU.

14:15.229 --> 14:17.982
YOU'RE LADYPANTS-ING LINCOLN.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.736
- YEAH, BUT HE WON'T MIND.
HE'S DEAD.

14:22.820 --> 14:24.613
AND AS LINCOLN HIMSELF SAID,

14:24.697 --> 14:26.156
"LIFE IS FOR THE LIVING."

14:26.240 --> 14:27.950
- I DON'T THINK
LINCOLN SAID THAT.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.493
- OH, EVERYONE SAID THAT
AT SOME POINT.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.745
I'M SURE HE DID TOO.

14:31.829 --> 14:33.414
- BUT YOUR LIFE ISN'T OVER.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.291
YOU STILL HAVE TIME
TO DO GREAT THINGS

14:35.374 --> 14:37.167
THAT WILL OVERSHADOW
THAT COMMERCIAL.

14:37.251 --> 14:39.086
DO NOT SELL YOURSELF SHORT.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.463
IT'S JUST A COMMERCIAL.
IT DOESN'T DEFINE YOU.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.132
- OH, YEAH? WELL, TELL THAT
TO MR. WHIPPLE

14:43.215 --> 14:47.303
AND THE "WHERE'S THE BEEF?" LADY
AND THE TIDY BOWL MAN.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.470
YOU KNOW THE ACTOR
IN THAT BOAT

14:48.554 --> 14:50.264
GRADUATED FROM JUILLIARD.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.849
- REALLY?

14:51.932 --> 14:54.268
- OH, HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

14:54.351 --> 14:56.520
- I'M SORRY I LIED.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.106
I KNOW IT'S SILLY,
BUT EVER SINCE HIGH SCHOOL,

14:59.189 --> 15:00.691
I THOUGHT THAT BIGGER BOOBS
WERE THE THING

15:00.774 --> 15:02.318
THAT WOULD MAKE
MY LIFE PERFECT.

15:02.401 --> 15:04.236
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.155
GIRLS I KNEW IN HIGH SCHOOL
WITH BOOBS THAT BIG

15:06.238 --> 15:08.616
JUST ENDED UP
GETTING KNOCKED UP.

15:08.699 --> 15:11.285
- I DID GET KNOCKED UP
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.495
- SEE? DIDN'T NEED THE BOOBS.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.539
STILL DON'T.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.833
I WOULD'VE RUN OFF THE ROAD
FOR THOSE LEGS.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.501
THOSE ARE REAL, RIGHT?

15:19.585 --> 15:21.545
- ONE OF THEM.

15:21.629 --> 15:24.006
I'M KIDDING.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.383
OH, IT'S SO CRAZY.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.677
I WORE THIS THING
ALL DAY

15:28.761 --> 15:31.472
AND STRUTTED AROUND
WITH SO MUCH CONFIDENCE.

15:31.555 --> 15:34.808
I WALKED INTO AN AUTO SHOP
LIKE I OWNED THE PLACE

15:34.892 --> 15:38.020
AND TALKED TO YOU ON THE C.B.
LIKE I'D HAD THREE VODKAS,

15:38.103 --> 15:40.230
WHEN I'D ONLY HAD TWO.

15:40.314 --> 15:41.690
- YOU KNOW,
IT WAS THAT CONFIDENCE

15:41.774 --> 15:45.069
THAT KEPT ME TALKING TO YOU
FOR THREE HOURS.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.155
- SO I GUESS
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

15:48.238 --> 15:50.824
THE BOOBS GAVE ME CONFIDENCE,

15:50.908 --> 15:53.702
BUT THE BOOBS WERE INSIDE ME
ALL ALONG.

15:53.786 --> 15:57.915
- YOU ARE FULL
OF INTERESTING IMAGERY.

15:57.998 --> 16:00.042
- SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.836
- WELL, HOW ABOUT DINNER
SOMETIME?

16:02.920 --> 16:03.879
- SURE. WHEN?

16:03.962 --> 16:06.382
- NEXT OCTOBER.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.549
- IN OCTOBER?

16:07.633 --> 16:08.801
- WELL, THAT'S THE NEXT TIME

16:08.884 --> 16:10.719
I'M GONNA BE ROLLING
THROUGH CLEVELAND.

16:10.803 --> 16:14.848
BUT WE DO HAVE A FEW HOURS
OF MOONLIGHT LEFT TONIGHT.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.892
- I'LL DRINK TO THAT.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.936
[chuckles]

16:19.019 --> 16:20.896
[car horn honking]

16:20.979 --> 16:22.439
I FORGOT.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.733
I LEFT A 90-YEAR-OLD WOMAN
IN THE CAR.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.276
- REALLY?

16:26.360 --> 16:28.070
SHOULD YOU BE SITTING HERE
DRINKING BEER WITH ME?

16:28.153 --> 16:31.156
- I CRACKED A WINDOW.

16:33.450 --> 16:35.244
- SO YOU COULDN'T TALK VICTORIA
OUT OF IT?

16:35.327 --> 16:37.246
- NO.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:37.329 --> 16:38.580
MAYBE THERE'S ANOTHER WAY
TO LOOK AT IT.

16:38.664 --> 16:40.374
MAYBE HISTORY JUST NEEDS TO BE
THE TRUTH,

16:40.457 --> 16:41.542
WARTS AND ALL.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.585
- BUT WE NEED OUR HEROES.

16:43.669 --> 16:44.878
WHEN PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON
DON'T LIVE UP

16:44.962 --> 16:46.588
TO OUR EXPECTATIONS,

16:46.672 --> 16:49.091
WE HAVE LINCOLN
TO LOOK UP TO.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.801
ALL THAT WOULD BE GONE.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.762
- WELL SAID, ARTIE.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.306
YOU KNOW, YOUR LOVE OF LINCOLN
IS INSPIRING.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.517
I'D LIKE TO COME SIT IN
ON SOME OF YOUR LECTURES.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.728
- SOMETIMES I LIKE TO GO
TO THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL

17:00.811 --> 17:03.564
AND CLIMB UP ON HIS LAP
AND PRETEND I'M A BABY.

17:08.234 --> 17:10.779
- OR I COULD JUST READ A BOOK.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.781
- EXCUSE ME, I'M LAUREN BARRY
FROM <i> 60 MINUTES.</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:15.951
- OH, HI, I'M MELANIE MORETTI.
THIS IS PROFESSOR FIRESTONE.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.286
- NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.788
- SORRY I'M LATE.
I'M VICTORIA CHASE.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.415
- OH,<i> THAT</i> VICTORIA CHASE.

17:21.498 --> 17:23.166
I DIDN'T PUT
TWO AND TWO TOGETHER.

17:23.250 --> 17:26.295
YOU'RE MRS. LADYPANTS.

17:26.377 --> 17:27.463
MY THREE-YEAR-OLD
RUNS AROUND SAYING,

17:27.546 --> 17:30.466
"I LOVE FRESHNESS
OF CROTCH."

17:30.549 --> 17:33.135
- SOUNDS LIKE
A DELIGHTFUL CHILD.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.012
- I'M SORRY.
DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG?

17:35.095 --> 17:38.307
- OH, IT'S JUST THAT I HAVE BEEN
AN ACTRESS FOR 35 YEARS,

17:38.390 --> 17:40.434
AND IT'S FRUSTRATING
THAT ALL THE GOOD WORK I'VE DONE

17:40.517 --> 17:43.145
HAS BEEN OBLITERATED
BY THIS ONE EMBARRASSING THING.

17:43.228 --> 17:44.938
YOU SEE, I DIDN'T KNOW
THEY WERE GOING TO AIR IT

17:45.022 --> 17:46.023
IN THE UNITED STATES.

17:46.106 --> 17:48.108
- WELL, THAT'S A SHAME.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.652
UNFORTUNATELY, ONCE IT'S OUT
THERE, IT'S OUT THERE.

17:50.736 --> 17:52.279
- HM.

17:52.362 --> 17:55.115
THAT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.534
- AND SPEAKING
OF GETTING THINGS OUT THERE,

17:57.618 --> 17:59.119
I'M DYING TO SEE
THE LETTER,

17:59.203 --> 18:00.287
THE LINCOLN MYTH SHATTERED.

18:00.370 --> 18:02.790
THIS IS EXPLOSIVE STUFF.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.292
- UH, LOOK.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.543
I-I'M SORRY
TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THIS,

18:06.627 --> 18:08.295
BUT I'M AFRAID
I HAVE TERRIBLE NEWS.

18:08.378 --> 18:09.838
UH, THE LETTER IS GONE.

18:09.922 --> 18:10.964
- WHAT?

18:11.048 --> 18:12.758
- I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED HERE.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.510
WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:14.593 --> 18:15.886
- WELL, THE LETTER GOT IN
WITH A LOAD OF WHITES

18:15.969 --> 18:17.471
THAT I WAS DOING,

18:17.554 --> 18:19.681
AND NOW IT'S NOTHING MORE
THAN A LITTLE LAUNDRY BALL

18:19.765 --> 18:22.017
OF 150-YEAR-OLD PAPER.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.685
- SERIOUSLY?

18:23.769 --> 18:25.187
WE CAN'T GO THROUGH
WITH THE STORY

18:25.270 --> 18:26.188
WITH NO EVIDENCE.

18:26.271 --> 18:27.397
- OH, I UNDERSTAND.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.149
I AM A NEWSWOMAN
AS WELL.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.859
- YOU'RE A NEWSWOMAN,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.861
AND THEY LET YOU DO
THOSE DIAPER COMMERCIALS?

18:32.945 --> 18:36.323
- WELL, LESLIE STAHL DOES
THOSE METAMUCIL COMMERCIALS.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.533
- REALLY?
- WELL, HOW SHOULD I KNOW?

18:37.616 --> 18:39.660
WHY DON'T YOU ASK
YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLD?

18:39.743 --> 18:43.914
GOOD-BYE, LAUREN.

18:43.997 --> 18:46.250
HERE, ARTIE.
DO WITH IT AS YOU WILL.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.376
- OH!

18:47.459 --> 18:49.211
- I KNEW IT!

18:49.294 --> 18:52.214
I GOT SUSPICIOUS
WHEN YOU SAID YOU DID LAUNDRY.

18:52.297 --> 18:56.552
- I TOTALLY IMPROV-ED THAT
WHOLE THING ABOUT THE WHITES.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.886
I MEAN, YOU WERE RIGHT,
MELANIE.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.848
I WAS LADYPANTS-ING LINCOLN.

19:00.931 --> 19:04.226
AND UNLIKE HIM, I DO HAVE TIME
TO CHANGE MY STORY.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.895
- BESIDES, HASN'T HE SUFFERED
ENOUGH AT THE HANDS OF ACTORS?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.441
- NEITHER OF US FINDS THAT
FUNNY, MELANIE.

19:11.525 --> 19:14.069
- SORRY. IT'S HOT IN HERE.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.279
- OH, NOW I GET IT.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.156
YOU'RE AS FUNNY
AS SCARLETT JOHANSSON.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.582
- I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.959
I JUST RECEIVED A TEXT
FROM MY AGENT,

19:29.042 --> 19:31.211
AND LIFETIME IS EAGER
TO HEAR MY PITCH

19:31.295 --> 19:35.841
FOR THE LIFETIME ORIGINAL MOVIE,
<i>ABE AND THE BABE...</i>

19:35.924 --> 19:38.969
A FICTIONAL ACCOUNT OF AMERICA'S
FIRST INTERN SCANDAL.

19:39.052 --> 19:42.806
AND I'M ATTACHED AS THE
SEDUCTIVE 19-YEAR-OLD INTERN.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.269
WELL, PEOPLE AGED
DIFFERENTLY THEN.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.312
- THAT'S GREAT.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

19:48.395 --> 19:49.479
- THANK YOU.

19:49.563 --> 19:51.315
- AND SEE? I WAS RIGHT.

19:51.398 --> 19:53.150
YOUR STORY DOES HAVE
MORE CHAPTERS.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.903
- AND YOU WERE RIGHT
AS WELL, OLD ONE.

19:55.986 --> 20:00.449
AFTER DINNER, I'M RETURNING
THE WATER BRAS I BOUGHT.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.909
- OH, JOY,
ARE YOU SPEEDING AGAIN?

20:01.992 --> 20:03.660
- NO, I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.

20:03.744 --> 20:06.413
- ACTUALLY, THEY'RE AFTER ME.

20:06.496 --> 20:08.290
- WHAT? WHY?

20:08.373 --> 20:12.502
- WELL, I'M STILL KIND OF
TEST-DRIVING THIS PRIUS.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.257
- YOU'VE HAD IT FOR A WEEK.
THAT'S NOT A TEST-DRIVE.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.675
- I'M GONNA BUY IT.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.469
- I'M DRIVING A STOLEN CAR?

20:20.552 --> 20:23.013
- JUST BE COOL.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.265
SLAP ON ONE OF THOSE
WATER BRAS.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.268
- YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
I DIDN'T NEED THE BRA.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.645
- FOR DATING.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.481
THIS IS GRAND THEFT AUTO.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.942
SLAP ON THE BRA.
