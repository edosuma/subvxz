01:26.584 --> 01:28.709
My father wanted to
teach me from childhood.

01:28.917 --> 01:31.417
Than the one who is
afraid of something.

01:31.626 --> 01:35.334
Gives this fear immense
power over his life.

01:38.626 --> 01:40.542
Come on, jump.

01:41.001 --> 01:43.292
"He told me that
fear is an animal."

01:43.501 --> 01:46.417
And that an animal can
be tamed or killed.

02:02.917 --> 02:06.084
I did not always understand
what my father meant.

02:07.876 --> 02:12.417
But that day, I realized
he wanted me to be a man.

04:07.209 --> 04:08.917
Thanks, Sam. It was great.

04:09.126 --> 04:10.876
- See you next year.
- Yeah.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.751
"Are you coming, children?"

04:12.959 --> 04:14.334
- Good-bye, captain.
- Hello!

04:14.542 --> 04:16.666
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, guy.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.041
Good-bye, captain.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.291
Bye madam.

04:22.959 --> 04:24.251
I'm not disturbing you?

04:24.459 --> 04:25.917
Samantha! I did not see you.

04:26.126 --> 04:27.959
You told me four o'clock. It is 6:30 pm.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.917
- Yes. You are going to laugh...
- No! I do not have the time.

04:31.126 --> 04:34.292
Just a phone call
to warn, Samuel.

04:34.501 --> 04:36.501
"Samuel"?
Looks like a kid you're hooking.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.709
You're a kid.

04:37.876 --> 04:39.917
I say nothing when you
pretend to be the boss,

04:40.126 --> 04:43.251
when you bring your
daughters back on the boat,

04:43.459 --> 04:45.917
but 150 Euros more
gasoline, it gets drunk.

04:48.584 --> 04:49.584
And that?

04:49.667 --> 04:51.667
Is that my tip? No.

04:51.876 --> 04:54.751
It's for the full.
I prolonged because they burst.

04:54.959 --> 04:56.834
Result:
15 days booked next year.

04:57.042 --> 04:58.042
Then limit.

04:58.084 --> 05:01.376
A little thank you or a
kiss and we are quits.

05:01.959 --> 05:04.209
- I hate you.
- Me too I love you.

05:04.417 --> 05:05.876
This evening, no overtaking.

05:06.084 --> 05:07.501
I cut at 4 o'clock. 1 h.

05:07.709 --> 05:08.834
- 3h?
- 1 h.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.084
- 2h?
- You're fired.

05:10.292 --> 05:12.709
Ok. 1h, that's fine.

05:15.001 --> 05:16.126
1h15, 1h30, what.

05:16.334 --> 05:19.042
- 1 h!
- Here.

05:37.709 --> 05:38.709
Hi, Sam!

05:38.751 --> 05:40.542
It's okay? It goes well?

05:40.751 --> 05:42.626
- Thank you.
- It's cool. Great.

05:49.876 --> 05:53.167
The day I drive the
yacht that is there.

05:53.376 --> 05:55.667
So you can call me "captain".

05:55.876 --> 05:57.084
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:57.292 --> 05:58.542
Or "skipper".

05:58.751 --> 06:00.626
You can also...

06:00.834 --> 06:03.126
But "captain", it works.
Are you okay, captain?

06:03.334 --> 06:05.084
What's wrong?

06:05.292 --> 06:07.501
Have you seen the time?
Samantha stop calling me.

06:07.709 --> 06:10.542
Tomorrow we have the biggest
customer of the season.

06:10.751 --> 06:12.334
- It's okay, relax.
- I am relaxing?

06:12.542 --> 06:14.084
We're not having a good night?

06:14.292 --> 06:15.876
- I'm having fun.
- That's it. Kiffe.

06:16.084 --> 06:18.284
Do not worry about tomorrow.
Everything will be alright.

06:18.308 --> 06:19.542
Sit down or dance.

06:19.751 --> 06:20.917
She's not harassing you?

06:21.126 --> 06:23.751
Because it makes me a hell.

06:23.959 --> 06:25.751
- Yes, she called.
- I am fired.

06:25.959 --> 06:26.959
I'll handle it.

06:27.167 --> 06:29.126
Are you gonna manage?
I am waiting to see.

06:29.334 --> 06:31.917
Yes look. Look well.

06:38.292 --> 06:40.959
Do you want the
party to continue?

06:41.167 --> 06:42.501
Yeah!

06:42.709 --> 06:45.501
I'll ask you to make
a little game for me:

06:45.709 --> 06:47.209
A silence of one minute.

06:50.292 --> 06:52.209
It starts now. Hush.

06:52.417 --> 06:53.417
Hello? Samantha?

06:53.584 --> 06:56.834
5 h of the mat. What are you doing?

06:57.042 --> 07:00.709
Well, I'm sleeping. Is there a worry?
"All the neighborhood calls me."

07:00.917 --> 07:02.626
There would be music.

07:02.834 --> 07:05.834
What? Music? Well no.

07:06.042 --> 07:08.084
I would have heard it.
I can not hear him.

07:08.292 --> 07:10.917
I'm connected. Neighbors invent!

07:11.126 --> 07:15.084
Yeah. They are a bit mythos.
I'm on the boat.

07:15.292 --> 07:17.292
I have the beach in front
of me and it is deserted.

07:17.459 --> 07:18.917
There is not a cat around.

07:19.126 --> 07:20.251
Stop playing.

07:20.459 --> 07:22.667
It was cute when you were
little, but no longer there.

07:22.876 --> 07:26.001
Oh yes, you're right.
At the time for me.

07:26.209 --> 07:28.584
I see a guy with a hat.

07:28.792 --> 07:29.834
They're in band.

07:30.042 --> 07:31.042
They are going to move,

07:31.167 --> 07:33.376
make a campfire...
I'll fire them.

07:34.292 --> 07:35.459
* -chut!
- Hush!

07:35.667 --> 07:36.907
I do not want any more noise.

07:37.042 --> 07:38.792
Okay, I'm telling them.
Count on me.

07:39.001 --> 07:40.542
Okay. So much the better.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.209
Good. Where were we already?

08:23.542 --> 08:24.917
Sam, are you there?

08:26.959 --> 08:28.042
Sat?

08:30.501 --> 08:32.251
"Samuel?"

08:44.459 --> 08:46.126
Good morning.

08:46.334 --> 08:49.126
It is impossible to
go out to sea today.

08:49.334 --> 08:51.584
It looks very quiet like that.

08:51.792 --> 08:54.126
But it's dangerous.
You do not recognize me?

08:56.626 --> 08:57.709
Kristin.

08:59.209 --> 09:03.167
Last summer, the boat,
the calanques...

09:03.376 --> 09:06.334
"Ah, but yes!
Kristin... Kristin from Berlin."

09:06.542 --> 09:08.959
- From London.
- That's it.

09:09.167 --> 09:11.042
- It's cool to see you!
- Yes.

09:11.251 --> 09:15.126
With your baby. Hey? Your baby.

09:15.334 --> 09:16.459
And actually...

09:16.667 --> 09:19.417
Sorry, you can not
get on the boat.

09:19.626 --> 09:21.417
I tidy.
I'll introduce Gloria to you.

09:24.251 --> 09:26.376
Good morning, Gloria.

09:26.584 --> 09:27.584
It gurgles in English.

09:27.751 --> 09:28.751
Hey, Gloria.

09:28.917 --> 09:31.167
She's hurting, huh? Bravo.

09:31.376 --> 09:32.417
It's your daughter.

09:32.626 --> 09:33.792
Hmm?

09:35.709 --> 09:36.834
Your daughter.

09:37.417 --> 09:38.751
Your daughter, Samuel.

09:38.959 --> 09:40.334
Here. Your daughter.

09:40.542 --> 09:43.084
In French, when you mean.

09:43.292 --> 09:44.792
You say "ma", you see.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.292
I know it must be a
shock to you, but...

09:49.209 --> 09:50.417
It's your baby.

09:51.334 --> 09:53.626
No. "Your baby of me," no.

09:53.834 --> 09:56.167
It has nothing to do.
It's not me.

09:56.376 --> 09:57.126
It has <i>3</i> months.

09:57.334 --> 10:00.334
Yeah, <i>3</i> months, but what?

10:01.167 --> 10:03.042
What are you doing to me?

10:03.626 --> 10:05.417
I know, it's crazy, but...

10:05.626 --> 10:07.709
- I came to...
- It's not crazy.

10:07.917 --> 10:10.584
But no, it's not crazy!
It's not crazy at all.

10:10.792 --> 10:11.792
It's not crazy.

10:11.917 --> 10:14.917
Because in fact, no.
It's unfortunate, but not.

10:15.126 --> 10:17.959
I am sorry.
Because if you think...

10:19.626 --> 10:21.376
Well no. You see?

10:21.584 --> 10:23.001
So sorry, but no.

10:23.209 --> 10:24.459
Ok, kiss.

10:24.667 --> 10:26.042
You got 20 Euros for the taxi?

10:26.251 --> 10:30.209
Please.
Um yes. This, yes! This, yes!

10:30.417 --> 10:31.834
I'll get that for you.

10:32.042 --> 10:33.959
But <i>3</i> months, no.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.709
Here. 20 Euros and kisses, bye.

10:42.917 --> 10:44.126
Here!

10:44.626 --> 10:45.917
Here.

10:48.334 --> 10:49.584
Thank you very much.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.042
Can you keep it for me?

10:51.251 --> 10:53.542
Uh... yeah, but...

10:53.751 --> 10:56.542
So wait. You do... hurry up!

10:58.501 --> 11:00.001
It's heavy, though.

11:02.209 --> 11:04.251
Do not worry, she's coming back.

11:05.126 --> 11:06.584
Look.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.042
She pays and she comes back.
Look, do not worry.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.334
It does not help. She comes.

11:13.876 --> 11:16.626
But do not worry!
Yes but no. Look.

11:18.167 --> 11:19.167
Here.

11:19.209 --> 11:20.459
She's going to pay.

11:20.667 --> 11:22.417
She's paying. Look.

11:22.626 --> 11:25.667
What the hell is she doing?
Is she busy?

11:26.626 --> 11:28.001
She's standing there, right?

11:28.209 --> 11:29.917
Kristin!

11:30.542 --> 11:32.959
You've forgotten your stuff!

11:33.167 --> 11:34.709
Kristin, the bags!

11:36.876 --> 11:39.084
Not without the bags!

11:39.751 --> 11:41.126
Stop, stop, stop!

11:42.542 --> 11:44.084
Sleep with ladies.

11:46.376 --> 11:48.834
- What's this?
- Nothing. An abandoned baby.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.792
- Hey? It's disgusting.
- Exactly!

11:52.001 --> 11:54.792
Her mother stole 20
bullets and stood up.

11:55.001 --> 11:56.626
- She stole 20 bullets?
- Yes.

11:56.834 --> 11:58.417
You know that girl?

11:58.626 --> 11:59.626
No! What dalle!

12:00.709 --> 12:02.501
We vaguely slept together,

12:02.709 --> 12:04.792
but not enough to say:
"It's your daughter."

12:05.001 --> 12:08.084
It's too easy! I also
take a kid and I give it!

12:09.042 --> 12:10.209
Why is she crying?

12:10.417 --> 12:13.167
"It's obvious, she's upset.
You reject it."

12:13.376 --> 12:15.176
It's not easy,
father-daughter relationship.

12:15.334 --> 12:17.084
Me, with my father, it's...

12:17.292 --> 12:18.292
"Stop, with your father!"

12:19.292 --> 12:21.709
She is hungry. That's all.
You do not have milk?

12:30.459 --> 12:31.876
Wait, I got something.

12:34.917 --> 12:35.959
Her name is Gloria Stuart.

12:36.167 --> 12:37.834
Here. Stuart, it's not my name.

12:38.042 --> 12:39.959
So it's not my daughter.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.501
You're all confusing.

12:41.709 --> 12:44.876
I have a Kristin Stuart from
London on Facebook, there.

12:45.084 --> 12:47.001
Maybe it's her. Show me.

12:47.209 --> 12:49.167
It's her.
Looks like she's blocked her account.

12:49.376 --> 12:50.834
She has no friends.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.501
Normal!
Did you see what she does to people?

13:00.084 --> 13:01.959
- Well, answer.
- Yes.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.292
Hello?

13:06.334 --> 13:07.334
Hello?

13:07.417 --> 13:09.167
"Ah, Samuel?"
Kristin, where are you?

13:09.376 --> 13:12.251
Immediate boarding...
Sorry, I...

13:12.459 --> 13:15.709
I can not.
Take the plane. Do not do this to me.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.167
That's not cool.

13:17.376 --> 13:19.292
I know nothing about baby.

13:19.501 --> 13:22.584
You can not trust me.
I'll spoil it.

13:22.792 --> 13:24.001
Hello?

13:25.042 --> 13:27.667
Hello?
"I'm the one who ruins it, Samuel."

13:29.084 --> 13:33.251
It's me.
*-no! She's doing very well, this girl.

13:33.459 --> 13:37.542
I'm not doing well at all.
I'll never be a good mother.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.126
I'm sure you're going
to be a great father.

13:40.334 --> 13:42.834
No! I'm not a super father.

13:43.042 --> 13:46.417
I'm a kid.
You do not give a kid to another kid.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.001
Hello, Kristin? Kristin?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.501
She hung up.

13:56.709 --> 13:58.251
She's going to fly.

13:58.459 --> 14:00.292
It's far, the airport?

14:03.709 --> 14:06.417
Hey! It's okay, is not it?

14:06.626 --> 14:08.001
Gloria screams.

14:14.751 --> 14:15.751
Cuckoo, Sam.

14:15.876 --> 14:17.116
It's the brothel on the boat.

14:17.209 --> 14:20.584
Yes I saw that.
I do not know what happened.

14:20.792 --> 14:23.542
Two naked chicks
drink champagne!

14:23.751 --> 14:26.292
I'm here in 15 seconds.
* -no, not in 15 sec.

14:26.501 --> 14:28.376
There are bottles everywhere,

14:28.584 --> 14:30.417
hoods and diapers!

14:30.626 --> 14:32.459
No, but are you serious?

14:32.667 --> 14:35.709
I'll explain, but I'm taking
care of something before.

14:35.917 --> 14:37.376
I kiss you. Kisses.

14:38.542 --> 14:39.667
"Bisous"...

14:43.709 --> 14:47.834
immediate embarkation
for London...

14:48.042 --> 14:49.251
Whore!

14:50.084 --> 14:51.251
Sorry!

14:51.459 --> 14:54.126
I will give up a child.
It's not mine...

14:54.334 --> 14:58.001
Kristin!
Boarding pass and passport.

14:58.209 --> 15:01.089
- My girlfriend has forgotten her daughter.
- Boarding pass and passport.

15:01.113 --> 15:03.959
It's not me who's leaving.
It's her. With her!

15:04.167 --> 15:05.167
Kristin, the little one!

15:05.376 --> 15:07.751
Sir, bring him back.
That's the girl out there.

15:07.959 --> 15:10.459
Give him back directly.
She's over there.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.709
- Boarding pass and passport.
- You know a sentence!

15:13.917 --> 15:16.667
- Yeah, well, please!
- Do not touch me.

15:16.876 --> 15:18.542
Boarding pass and passport.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.667
Samuel? What are you doing here?

15:27.959 --> 15:32.959
Samantha, I'm a little late, but
I'll be there this afternoon.

15:33.126 --> 15:34.834
I'll be back at 3pm?

15:35.042 --> 15:39.459
Yes, you will be in London at 11am.
To go to the pub, it is direct in tube.

15:39.667 --> 15:43.334
Why are you laughing?
It seems like you said "cock".

15:43.542 --> 15:46.376
Not at all. I said tube.
The Metro.

15:46.584 --> 15:47.584
Put the cream.

15:47.667 --> 15:49.542
No, there's paraben!

15:49.751 --> 15:51.792
- That's good, guys!
- Must do that well.

15:52.001 --> 15:52.709
Look.

15:52.917 --> 15:56.459
The fasteners behind and
tuck you on the stomach.

15:56.667 --> 15:58.667
Squeeze too much,
she can breathe more.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.792
If you do not press it, it's gonna run.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.459
No, it's baby-dry.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.709
Its good.
Thank you, stéphane, Philippe.

16:04.917 --> 16:05.917
It's the opposite.

16:07.292 --> 16:08.959
What if she's crying on the plane?

16:09.167 --> 16:10.167
Impossible.

16:10.251 --> 16:11.626
She ate and she is clean.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.584
She's going to sleep all the way.
It's certain.

16:15.667 --> 16:16.667
Gloria screams.

16:16.792 --> 16:19.959
The hostess speaks in English.
Welcome to London.

16:20.167 --> 16:23.876
We hope you enjoyed
the flight...

16:24.084 --> 16:26.251
The worst flight of my life.

16:26.459 --> 16:28.542
It's okay.
Have you ever wept for your life?

16:28.751 --> 16:30.501
She does not like the plane.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.251
What line?

16:34.709 --> 16:36.501
Here! Piccadilly.

16:36.709 --> 16:39.626
Good game.
Not bad, for a girl of your age.

16:39.834 --> 16:40.834
Sam baragouin in English.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.292
Sir?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.626
Can you tell me the "teub"?

16:45.834 --> 16:46.834
"Teub"?

16:46.917 --> 16:48.001
"Teub".

16:48.209 --> 16:49.209
The tube!

16:49.251 --> 16:57.251
The man arle an lais at full speed...

17:00.334 --> 17:02.376
I did not understand anything. Sorry.

17:02.584 --> 17:04.001
You speak too fast.

17:04.209 --> 17:05.251
Fuck!

17:05.459 --> 17:07.459
That's what I understood. It was slower.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.584
Good. He just insulted us.

17:09.791 --> 17:11.376
We must find the "teub".

17:13.126 --> 17:15.209
Next station...

17:15.416 --> 17:17.209
But no, we're fine, there.

17:17.416 --> 17:19.876
Ah shit...

17:20.459 --> 17:22.084
It stinks.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.041
Well yeah.

17:25.459 --> 17:26.459
Well yeah...

17:36.792 --> 17:38.542
Oh yeah, okay.

17:40.584 --> 17:42.042
A man yells in English.

17:42.251 --> 17:44.917
Find me a guy who
looks like our guy!

17:45.126 --> 17:47.459
Do your job, damn!

17:47.667 --> 17:48.417
Or I turn you!

17:48.626 --> 17:49.959
They're shit, shit!

17:50.167 --> 17:52.084
- You speak French?
- It happens to me.

17:52.292 --> 17:54.876
- You're going to save my life.
- With pleasure.

17:55.084 --> 17:56.876
- Me, it's Bernie.
- I'm Samuel.

17:57.084 --> 17:58.167
That's sublime.

17:58.376 --> 17:59.751
That's fine, yeah.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.876
You will help me. I'm lost.

18:02.084 --> 18:04.792
- Stay to the left.
Wrote: "Hold your right."

18:05.001 --> 18:08.834
The English laugh not even
with the seductive tourists.

18:09.042 --> 18:10.959
I'm not a tourist.

18:11.167 --> 18:13.834
Is not that close?
It is not false.

18:14.042 --> 18:16.334
That's good. Been to londres?

18:16.542 --> 18:18.792
15 years I live here.
What are you looking for?

18:19.001 --> 18:21.584
I have to give a baby back to his mother.

18:21.792 --> 18:23.501
- What baby?
- The baby that's there.

18:23.709 --> 18:24.376
Whore!

18:24.584 --> 18:26.959
Hold your right!

18:33.292 --> 18:34.292
No no no!

18:34.334 --> 18:35.626
Hold your right!

18:36.292 --> 18:37.792
Hold your right!

18:39.334 --> 18:40.459
Damn, damn it!

18:46.917 --> 18:48.876
Hold your right!

18:51.334 --> 18:53.584
I'm here, I'm here!

18:53.792 --> 18:57.251
She's good! Yeah!

18:58.584 --> 18:59.584
Bravo!

18:59.667 --> 19:01.626
Yeah, she's good.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.251
Hello, Michael. I found it.

19:07.459 --> 19:09.292
- Wait!
- I do not have the time.

19:09.501 --> 19:12.751
It's a golden opportunity.
Stuntman, it is a sublime craft.

19:12.959 --> 19:15.839
There's lots of money to be made.
I'm looking for his mother, not work.

19:15.863 --> 19:18.209
And I go home.
"Where is her mother?"

19:18.417 --> 19:21.584
She works at old queen's head.
It would be in the corner.

19:21.792 --> 19:23.334
It's right there.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.917
- That's it!
- No, but wait!

19:26.126 --> 19:28.417
If you change your mind,

19:28.626 --> 19:32.126
there, there are my pro
and behind coordinates...

19:32.334 --> 19:34.459
It's personal. We never know.

19:34.667 --> 19:38.626
Domino effect that makes
snowball and needle thread...

19:38.834 --> 19:43.167
The bird makes its nest.
"What nest?" There is no nest.

19:43.751 --> 19:47.542
Well, I... Well, here we are.

19:48.167 --> 19:51.792
Good. Nice to meet you.
Stay cool.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.959
We're not bored with you.

19:55.167 --> 19:57.667
What's the matter?

20:00.667 --> 20:03.834
No, do not start.
You'll be fine with your mother.

20:04.042 --> 20:06.626
A dad like me on a
daily basis is tiring.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.042
Do not look at me like that.

20:08.251 --> 20:10.084
It's hot. It will not work.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.042
Trust me, nothing
replaces a mom.

20:13.251 --> 20:15.042
It's a canon, a mom.

20:24.042 --> 20:25.417
A Coca light.

20:25.792 --> 20:26.792
Sorry?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.876
Coke light.

20:30.376 --> 20:32.459
The sugar-free, light.
Do you understand "light"?

20:32.667 --> 20:34.542
No, she does not speak English.

20:35.459 --> 20:37.001
It wants a <i>diet coke.</i>

20:37.209 --> 20:38.209
It's not the same here.

20:38.334 --> 20:39.959
You all speak French?

20:40.167 --> 20:44.084
A bar is not a surprise.
London would be the 6th French city.

20:44.292 --> 20:47.501
There would be more French here
than in Bordeaux. It's crazy!

20:47.709 --> 20:48.709
It's crazy.

20:48.917 --> 20:51.167
Look.

20:51.376 --> 20:54.292
So we would be more
of bayonne, dijon...

20:54.501 --> 20:55.542
It's less crazy.

20:55.751 --> 20:58.834
And otherwise, you may
be able to help me.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.042
I'm looking for that waitress, Kristin.

21:01.251 --> 21:04.042
- No, never seen.
- You can not tell me that.

21:04.251 --> 21:06.959
She works there.
This is the queen machin.

21:07.167 --> 21:08.834
It's your colleague.
I never saw her.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.417
It's a new owner.
She changed her pub.

21:11.626 --> 21:14.584
You know the number of waitresses who...
Leave it.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.584
How much do I owe you?
Two pounds.

21:16.792 --> 21:18.042
Fuck, it's pounds here!

21:18.251 --> 21:19.834
- Yes.
- I have Euros.

21:20.042 --> 21:21.792
We can settle it.

21:22.001 --> 21:24.792
Oh damn, it's not possible!

21:25.001 --> 21:28.292
Sorry! Excuse me! I lost...

21:28.501 --> 21:31.001
Ah well, it is... He's there.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.459
Whore! No!

21:49.417 --> 21:51.876
What the hell are I doing here?

21:57.709 --> 21:58.709
Oh no!

21:58.792 --> 22:01.667
Shit!
It was not raining two minutes ago.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.376
I will find a solution.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.584
Hello? How are you,
my favorite Samantha?

22:16.792 --> 22:17.876
Where are you?

22:18.084 --> 22:18.792
In London.

22:19.001 --> 22:20.501
- What?
- I explain to you.

22:20.709 --> 22:21.709
Big galley.

22:21.876 --> 22:23.876
I have a baby on my arms,
I do not find his mother.

22:24.001 --> 22:28.084
I lost wallet, passports...
She is hungry. It is raining.

22:28.292 --> 22:30.001
You really have to help me, Sam.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.501
Hold on. Are you in London?

22:32.709 --> 22:35.542
Yes, but it's not that far.
Ben, stay there!

22:35.751 --> 22:38.376
I warned you, okay?
You're fired.

22:38.584 --> 22:40.126
Yes, make me a transfer...

22:40.334 --> 22:42.834
Listen to me. I'm joking more, there.

22:43.042 --> 22:45.084
Ok, it hurts, but you're fired.

22:45.751 --> 22:47.334
Good-bye, Sam.

23:24.251 --> 23:27.501
"Do you know that address?"
"That place?"

23:27.709 --> 23:30.417
- Yes.
- Continue, then right.

23:30.626 --> 23:33.084
Right, like that? Ok. Thank you.

23:58.084 --> 24:01.251
Hush! Come on, do not cry.

24:01.584 --> 24:04.251
It will be fine.
We will find a solution.

24:07.751 --> 24:08.917
Do not be afraid.

24:10.084 --> 24:11.751
We must not be afraid.

24:12.917 --> 24:15.167
Come on. You must sleep, my daughter.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.209
My daughter...

24:36.834 --> 24:37.834
Thank you.

24:48.334 --> 24:49.459
Sir?

24:52.501 --> 24:54.834
You can't be here.

24:56.667 --> 24:58.667
The house is under video surveillance,

24:58.876 --> 25:01.001
and the police will be here in a minute.

25:01.209 --> 25:04.292
So, you better go now. Please sir.

25:05.292 --> 25:06.292
<i>Sir I warning you.</i>

25:06.417 --> 25:10.542
I have a pepper spray, and
I'm not afraid to use it.

25:10.751 --> 25:12.584
Sir. Last warning.

25:36.209 --> 25:37.209
Dad.

25:41.042 --> 25:43.834
You said it! You said it!
She said "dad"!

25:45.126 --> 25:48.126
It's daddy. It's me. Redirect it!
Dad.

25:48.334 --> 25:49.501
- Dad.
- Tata.

25:49.709 --> 25:50.709
Tata.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.751
- Dad. Dad!
- That's dad.

25:53.876 --> 25:54.876
Dad.

25:57.084 --> 25:58.084
Come on, come on.

25:58.251 --> 26:00.167
Gloria, come, come!

26:01.501 --> 26:02.501
Come!

26:10.834 --> 26:11.876
Cuckoo, my baby.

26:13.251 --> 26:14.251
It's okay?

26:21.917 --> 26:23.709
It's okay?

26:23.917 --> 26:25.917
Ah, you got a bobo? Hold on.

26:26.126 --> 26:27.417
Do not move.

26:27.626 --> 26:29.251
I have an idea.

26:29.459 --> 26:32.292
Hop there!
She works well, this ointment.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.126
Gloria!

26:37.667 --> 26:39.334
What did you do!

26:40.501 --> 26:42.126
We must not do that.
It's not good.

26:42.334 --> 26:43.792
How do I clean?

26:48.001 --> 26:49.001
Are you ready?

26:50.667 --> 26:51.751
Oh sorry!

26:53.376 --> 26:54.376
No!

26:56.626 --> 26:57.626
Yeah!

26:58.626 --> 27:00.167
Good night.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.376
"Here!"

27:12.334 --> 27:13.334
Hop!

28:23.334 --> 28:25.417
Here. We're all right.

28:25.626 --> 28:29.542
Dad? One day you can
take me to the cliff?

28:29.751 --> 28:33.209
Where you jumped when you were my age.
Yes, I'll take you.

28:33.417 --> 28:34.542
When?

28:34.751 --> 28:37.584
When you're able to
dunker all by yourself.

28:39.542 --> 28:42.126
I go. The first down has won.

28:51.417 --> 28:53.057
We can not see each other this weekend?

28:54.042 --> 28:56.376
No, not this weekend.
Gloria has no school.

28:56.584 --> 28:57.876
I'll stay with her.

28:58.084 --> 29:00.001
There's no school on weekends.

29:00.667 --> 29:02.001
Yes that's it.

29:02.584 --> 29:04.376
I'll stay with her, suddenly.

29:04.584 --> 29:07.501
So we never have a moment both?

29:19.459 --> 29:20.917
Cut.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.459
It's perfect!

29:22.667 --> 29:25.292
But it's got to be a lot worse.
Add more blood, or something.

29:25.501 --> 29:27.251
We have to do more reality.

29:29.459 --> 29:31.459
Great, we are goning to keep up!

29:38.834 --> 29:39.959
Sam, are you OK?

29:41.959 --> 29:43.626
Is Sam doing well?

29:45.209 --> 29:46.584
Let me go through, please.

29:47.417 --> 29:50.126
Please. He only needs me.

29:57.542 --> 30:00.959
Dad... Awake, you are immortal.

30:06.334 --> 30:07.834
French shit humor!

30:08.042 --> 30:10.251
We laugh.

30:10.459 --> 30:13.584
He jumped from a cliff to 8 years.
This stuff does not scare me.

30:13.792 --> 30:14.584
Get him out.

30:14.792 --> 30:17.501
We done with this dumbs.
Get the real actors!

30:17.709 --> 30:19.126
Bring all the stars!

30:19.334 --> 30:21.709
We take back!

30:23.126 --> 30:24.126
Here.

30:24.209 --> 30:27.292
I do not care who is responsible.
But I do care,

30:27.501 --> 30:30.167
it is that this shit
does not happen again!

30:30.376 --> 30:31.626
He's not happy.

30:31.834 --> 30:34.042
You have 10 s to find a solution.

30:34.251 --> 30:35.792
Starting now!

30:36.001 --> 30:38.667
You did well yelling.
It was a bit violent.

30:38.876 --> 30:40.501
Nothing to see. It was my tax expert.

30:40.709 --> 30:42.626
No, you were perfect.
The scene was sublime.

30:42.834 --> 30:45.001
The more I touch
death, the more sublime!

30:45.209 --> 30:48.042
Well, it's a bit of interest in the job!

30:52.792 --> 30:54.542
What do they still want?

30:54.751 --> 30:56.626
Get some rest. Big day tomorrow.

30:56.834 --> 30:58.501
What did he say?
He speaks too fast.

30:58.709 --> 31:00.959
- You gotta rest tonight.
- Yes.

31:01.167 --> 31:03.417
You still do not get
a word of English!

31:03.626 --> 31:04.917
I am here for this.

31:05.126 --> 31:07.209
Great day, tom.
See you tomorrow.

31:07.417 --> 31:08.542
Here's yours.

31:08.751 --> 31:10.626
What do we do tomorrow?

31:10.834 --> 31:13.292
We're shooting the scene... uh...

31:13.501 --> 31:16.167
You run under the plane taking off.
6 h of the mat '.

31:16.376 --> 31:19.126
- Why do I do this job?
- You know nothing else.

31:19.334 --> 31:21.751
You take me 6000 pounds a month.
You are lodged by the prod.

31:21.959 --> 31:24.417
You adore me. Gloria...
Its good. It's okay.

31:24.626 --> 31:26.417
Its good?

31:26.626 --> 31:29.167
You're 18 seconds late.

31:29.959 --> 31:31.959
Good. What is the score already?

31:32.167 --> 31:36.292
<i>- 4591160.
- So...</i> Match point!

31:40.251 --> 31:41.501
And hop I.

31:43.667 --> 31:46.501
"Oh, that's wonderful!"
- Past!

31:46.709 --> 31:50.084
Magic Gloria will immediately
switch to magic Samuel.

31:50.292 --> 31:52.126
What a move! What a move!

31:52.334 --> 31:55.126
- And hop!
- What a move!

31:56.751 --> 31:57.959
I go.

32:00.751 --> 32:01.876
Hop!

32:04.376 --> 32:05.459
Bernie!

32:08.042 --> 32:09.251
My heart!

32:10.251 --> 32:12.292
Oh, you missed me so much.

32:12.501 --> 32:13.542
We left two hours ago.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.126
It's way too much.

32:15.334 --> 32:17.251
Would you like a slice with us?

32:17.459 --> 32:19.084
Drink? Spent a night?

32:19.292 --> 32:20.292
No thanks.

32:20.459 --> 32:21.542
I have to work.

32:21.751 --> 32:24.209
- He's not an naughty boy.
- Leave him alone, Bernie.

32:24.417 --> 32:25.417
He's not gay.

32:25.959 --> 32:29.167
I think he's curious.
I feel it in my eyes.

32:29.376 --> 32:31.751
There is a possible slip.
I've got the knack for it.

32:32.376 --> 32:33.834
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

32:34.667 --> 32:35.667
Bernie.

32:35.792 --> 32:36.992
Stop darting the delivery men.

32:37.167 --> 32:38.376
Tomorrow, love.

32:38.584 --> 32:40.459
Come on, we go up. It goes into <i>5</i> min!

32:41.834 --> 32:44.042
What is this scarf
with cat paws?

32:44.251 --> 32:48.376
It's a silk stole.
A little camouflage tone on tone sublime.

32:48.584 --> 32:50.376
Okay. Yeah.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.709
Jack bates!

32:56.792 --> 32:58.251
He lost his past.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.376
He never had a present.

33:05.751 --> 33:08.084
He is fighting for the future.

33:12.417 --> 33:14.167
Bates is back. Season 8.

33:14.376 --> 33:16.376
Exclusively on channel 4.

33:17.292 --> 33:18.292
Yes, I am!

33:20.376 --> 33:22.417
You are too strong, dad.

33:22.626 --> 33:23.626
Oh, that tweete!

33:23.667 --> 33:25.626
That's it.

33:25.834 --> 33:29.084
- Double sprain for this teaser.
- For millions of viewers.

33:29.292 --> 33:31.834
And the signing of a season 9.
Put on the ointment.

33:32.042 --> 33:34.442
You're right. I'm looking
forward to burning for season 10.

33:34.584 --> 33:36.167
No, that's the end of the 8th.

33:36.376 --> 33:38.584
For the 10, it would require
a more powerful stuff.

33:38.792 --> 33:40.432
"He could jump from a
burning helicopter."

33:41.334 --> 33:43.167
And land in an acid bath!

33:43.376 --> 33:44.542
Well yeah.

33:44.751 --> 33:46.334
Yeah, great!

33:46.542 --> 33:47.542
It'll slam!

33:48.876 --> 33:50.251
I'll slam!

33:50.459 --> 33:52.209
"That would be sublime!"

33:53.084 --> 33:54.084
Mermaid.

33:55.251 --> 33:57.584
It's a mamma's mail. Dad!

33:57.792 --> 33:59.417
Mom sent me an email!

33:59.626 --> 34:01.126
Yes yes yes!

34:12.417 --> 34:15.042
"After Russia, here
I am now in China."

34:15.251 --> 34:19.542
"I do not have time to enjoy it, because
I have to infiltrate the Chinese mafia."

34:19.751 --> 34:22.251
"To catch this villain
of wong kar-wai."

34:22.458 --> 34:23.458
"As usual,"

34:23.667 --> 34:27.251
"I miss you honey.
The only thing that comforts me,"

34:27.458 --> 34:30.458
"is to know that you are with the
most loving, intelligent dad,."

34:30.667 --> 34:34.001
"Courageous, and above all, the
most seductive in the world."

34:34.208 --> 34:36.126
"You can be proud of your dad,."

34:36.333 --> 34:39.417
"Because he is the
best man in the world."

34:39.626 --> 34:41.292
"I love you mom."

34:44.042 --> 34:46.417
"What is she doing this time?"

34:46.626 --> 34:48.667
She's infiltrated
in the Chinese mafia.

34:48.876 --> 34:50.876
Ah cool!
And it's fine, over there?

34:51.083 --> 34:53.251
- Yeah, super nice.
- She is lucky.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.376
We're rotting right now.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.917
Hum...

34:58.042 --> 34:59.584
And she has a long time?

34:59.792 --> 35:02.917
Time to wedge wong kar-wai.
It's the bad guy.

35:03.126 --> 35:05.667
Ah, wong kar-wai! Yeah.

35:05.876 --> 35:07.376
It will last for a while.

35:07.584 --> 35:09.167
Yeah, I know.

35:09.376 --> 35:12.834
- Wish him good courage.
- Yeah yeah.

35:13.042 --> 35:16.417
Because wong
kar-wai, we need it.

35:18.709 --> 35:20.876
"I'd love to see you so much, mom.
Promised,."

35:21.084 --> 35:22.626
"If you are on a secret mission,"

35:22.834 --> 35:25.209
"I'll do as if I did not know
you to put you in danger."

35:25.417 --> 35:27.959
"Maybe one day you'll
end up coming to London."

35:28.167 --> 35:31.084
"For one of your missions.
I love you. Gloria."

35:44.792 --> 35:47.709
Soon, mama will have made all
the countries of the world.

35:47.917 --> 35:50.751
Oh, right?
No, there must be a few.

35:50.959 --> 35:52.834
- Four.
- Did you count?

35:53.042 --> 35:55.084
Yeah. When it has finished,

35:55.292 --> 35:57.001
she will return to London.

35:57.209 --> 36:00.459
No, it does not mean anything.
It depends on his mission.

36:00.667 --> 36:03.334
She has already made ltaly twice.
Three.

36:03.542 --> 36:07.334
<i>3</i> times ltaly, 4 times Germany, <i>5</i>
times Japan and 6 times Thailand.

36:07.542 --> 36:11.126
Ok. Well yeah.
So she'll end up going through here.

36:11.334 --> 36:15.292
"Or she has already come,
but she can not tell us."

36:15.501 --> 36:18.959
Oh, there's that too.
It's not con.

36:52.834 --> 36:55.501
It is still the class,
a secret mamma.

36:57.042 --> 36:59.001
Sometimes I think you're lucky.

36:59.667 --> 37:02.084
It could have
happened on anyone.

37:02.292 --> 37:04.084
You could have a normal mother.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.167
It's cool. No?

37:08.459 --> 37:10.334
This is so cool.

37:11.084 --> 37:15.167
"Can you give me a recap of all
the countries of your mother?"

37:15.376 --> 37:17.751
Because sometimes I forget.

37:17.959 --> 37:20.126
History to make me a recap, what.

37:20.334 --> 37:21.959
Hey, glo?

38:29.959 --> 38:31.584
What are you doing?

38:31.792 --> 38:34.251
Excuse me.
I send an email. I arrive.

38:35.709 --> 38:37.542
Have not you let the matter go?

38:39.001 --> 38:41.167
You know that one day she will understand?

38:41.376 --> 38:43.042
Do not start, please.

38:43.251 --> 38:45.084
Ok. Well, I'm going.

38:45.876 --> 38:47.042
Ok. See you tomorrow.

38:48.292 --> 38:49.834
That's it, tomorrow.

39:24.209 --> 39:27.792
"Can you get out of school earlier?"
At 3:30 pm, there is a 3D session.

39:28.001 --> 39:30.709
No, no, you're meeting
with my manager.

39:30.917 --> 39:33.126
- This evening, the director?
- Yeah.

39:33.334 --> 39:35.501
A hard time! Well tomorrow, then.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.251
No more.
You've got to go to the doctor.

39:38.917 --> 39:41.167
What's the bad
news this morning?

39:41.376 --> 39:42.584
Sorry.

39:42.792 --> 39:44.712
You know what?
We're not going to go tomorrow.

39:44.876 --> 39:47.792
I do not like doctors.
They make bites.

39:48.001 --> 39:50.917
They give out disgusting drugs.
We will not go. What?

39:51.126 --> 39:52.292
Are you afraid of bites?

39:52.501 --> 39:53.584
No, I'm not afraid.

39:53.792 --> 39:54.792
- Yes.
- No.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.667
Whatever!
Yes, you're scared of bites.

39:57.876 --> 39:59.667
But no. Im shy.

39:59.876 --> 40:01.459
It has nothing to do.

40:01.667 --> 40:03.834
You'll be less afraid
if I come with you?

40:04.626 --> 40:05.959
- Yes.
- Ok.

40:06.167 --> 40:08.542
But you have to
learn to go alone.

40:08.751 --> 40:11.459
When we're more both...
Why do you say that?

40:11.667 --> 40:13.627
When I get a job, I can
not go with you anymore.

40:13.834 --> 40:15.376
You know what you want to do?

40:15.584 --> 40:18.042
Yes. I want to be like you.

40:20.334 --> 40:22.292
Come on. Hello.

40:23.834 --> 40:25.334
You want to be stunned?

40:25.959 --> 40:27.876
Immortal.

40:28.792 --> 40:33.126
In a row two by two, the children.

40:33.334 --> 40:36.042
"Let us go back to Gloria's
repeated absences.

40:36.251 --> 40:39.584
"Repeat"? It's strong.
There was a wake-up call yesterday, but...

40:39.792 --> 40:40.992
Last week, she did not come.

40:41.126 --> 40:44.417
- Oh, right? Not even on Monday?
- No.

40:44.626 --> 40:45.834
The week before, either.

40:46.042 --> 40:47.292
"At this moment,"

40:47.501 --> 40:50.376
I shot the explosion scenes
on the tower bridge.

40:50.584 --> 40:54.251
Life is not an entertainment
or an amusement park.

40:54.459 --> 40:56.126
Do you have any idea of the.

40:56.334 --> 40:58.042
Of your education...

40:58.251 --> 41:01.709
Yes, I know the
consequences, but in fact...

41:01.917 --> 41:03.584
She was sad.

41:03.792 --> 41:06.917
Because of the disappearance
of sergeant Newman.

41:07.126 --> 41:09.376
And I thought to
cheer him up in...

41:09.584 --> 41:11.376
What happens to sergeant Newman?

41:11.584 --> 41:13.876
Oh, sorry, I spoiled.

41:14.084 --> 41:15.251
"He's not gonna die?"

41:16.042 --> 41:19.001
Secret of production.
I can not say.

41:19.584 --> 41:20.584
Oh no.

41:21.959 --> 41:23.626
Not Newman.

41:26.917 --> 41:28.417
Here, I brought you that.

41:29.209 --> 41:31.667
It is... Yes, it's
the real ones.

41:31.876 --> 41:34.751
Worn by the actor.
Oh thank you. How nice.

41:34.959 --> 41:36.126
It's a pleasure.

41:39.126 --> 41:40.917
Oh yes, it's great.

41:44.834 --> 41:46.954
I'm telling you this for
the good of the little one.

41:47.042 --> 41:48.334
You are a good father.

41:48.542 --> 41:50.959
You love your daughter.
She is adorable,

41:51.167 --> 41:53.042
when it is there,

41:53.251 --> 41:54.751
but here we are in real life.

41:54.959 --> 41:56.292
Yes.

41:56.501 --> 41:59.834
I do not want to interfere
in your private life, but...

42:00.042 --> 42:01.042
The stories.

42:01.209 --> 42:02.917
She tells about her mother.

42:03.126 --> 42:05.001
Are surprising. As an educator.

42:05.209 --> 42:08.459
Your daughter, I must
know what it really is.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.251
Of his mother. You told me.

42:10.459 --> 42:11.792
That she was to return to London.

42:13.334 --> 42:15.292
You really want
to know the truth?

42:19.292 --> 42:21.751
I lent 20 Euros to his mother
8 years ago for a taxi.

42:24.417 --> 42:25.917
And she never came back.

42:26.417 --> 42:27.709
Oh...

42:29.292 --> 42:30.959
Aie aie aie!

42:31.167 --> 42:32.417
There you go.

42:32.626 --> 42:34.251
'It's okay.

42:34.459 --> 42:35.539
We did not feel anything.

42:35.584 --> 42:37.126
Still stings.

42:37.334 --> 42:38.959
Thank you for accompanying me.

42:39.167 --> 42:40.167
Every time.

42:40.251 --> 42:43.001
"I'm counting on you to remind
her to take her medication."

42:43.209 --> 42:44.792
Yes. Morning noon and evening.

42:45.001 --> 42:46.751
As for my vitamins.

42:46.959 --> 42:49.917
"Luckily you're here
to set an example."

42:51.459 --> 42:54.376
Want to come see my baby dog?

42:54.584 --> 42:56.792
- Yes.
- Come!

43:08.042 --> 43:10.251
"I have the test
results, Samuel."

43:11.751 --> 43:13.126
Yes...

43:14.501 --> 43:16.709
The treatment did not work.

43:21.917 --> 43:23.292
How long?

43:23.834 --> 43:25.126
I do not know.

43:25.709 --> 43:27.292
Not a lot.

43:29.334 --> 43:30.584
I am sorry.

43:31.709 --> 43:33.209
We'll have tried everything.

44:08.792 --> 44:10.209
Good bye, sir.

44:47.001 --> 44:48.001
Glo?

44:48.084 --> 44:51.001
You will never guess what
the doctor has prescribed.

44:51.209 --> 44:52.251
What?

45:07.876 --> 45:09.459
Oh dear!

45:09.667 --> 45:12.167
I do not feel very well.
I am dizzy.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.209
Hold on. I check the order.

45:14.417 --> 45:18.917
Of course! We forgot the cotton candy.
That's why.

45:19.709 --> 45:20.834
Come on, dear.

45:21.042 --> 45:22.167
Let's go honey, come on.

45:22.667 --> 45:24.126
Sorry.

45:24.334 --> 45:26.001
I thought you were my daughter.

45:26.209 --> 45:28.501
You're so cute. Sorry.

45:29.292 --> 45:30.501
We're going, dear.

45:31.667 --> 45:33.459
Another one, please.

45:36.042 --> 45:37.709
Honey, I was wrong.

45:37.917 --> 45:40.001
I read wrong.
It is 2 cotton candy.

45:40.209 --> 45:43.834
One in the morning, one in the evening.
You want big or big?

45:44.251 --> 45:46.334
I want mom.

45:49.001 --> 45:51.084
You know what?
Drop the prescription.

45:51.292 --> 45:52.917
We'll make a good cheese.

45:53.126 --> 45:54.792
Or a hot dog. Or both.

45:55.001 --> 45:57.542
"I want to see her in real life, dad."

45:57.751 --> 46:00.084
I want to see her in real life.

46:06.709 --> 46:08.542
I know, my dear.

46:09.542 --> 46:10.709
I know.

46:12.334 --> 46:16.584
Gloria, my little
wonder everyday...

46:16.792 --> 46:18.167
Oh, Gloria!

46:18.376 --> 46:19.042
Gloria!

46:19.251 --> 46:23.042
Every day that passes is
an unbearable heartbreak.

46:24.042 --> 46:26.667
Gloria!

46:26.876 --> 46:28.251
"Ah!"

46:28.459 --> 46:29.917
My heart...

46:31.626 --> 46:35.292
I only have a few minutes
before heading back to Bangkok.

46:36.042 --> 46:37.876
But I promise you,

46:38.084 --> 46:40.584
at each mission, you are there.

46:42.626 --> 46:44.126
And above all, you are here.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.417
I love you so much.

46:53.876 --> 46:55.292
My little baby.

46:56.876 --> 46:58.209
Me too, mom.

46:58.417 --> 46:59.417
A lot.

47:02.251 --> 47:04.584
And if not, it's nice in Bangkok?

47:04.792 --> 47:06.334
- The weather is good?
- Oh yes.

47:06.542 --> 47:08.501
Very good. Wonderful!

47:08.709 --> 47:10.251
No, you know.
That is the problem.

47:10.459 --> 47:12.292
- No?
- No, it's not good.

47:12.501 --> 47:13.501
Not at all!

47:13.626 --> 47:16.209
It is raining! It's the monsoon, damn!

47:16.417 --> 47:18.959
She knows everything about her mother.
She holds a notebook.

47:19.167 --> 47:19.917
Notebook...

47:20.126 --> 47:22.001
Must be unstoppable.
Even on the weather.

47:22.209 --> 47:22.876
Shit!

47:23.084 --> 47:24.292
Yeah. Too bad.

47:24.501 --> 47:26.126
I liked it, but it's not worked.

47:26.334 --> 47:27.584
- Yes, it's worked.
- No no no.

47:27.792 --> 47:28.792
- File the wig.
- No!

47:29.001 --> 47:31.334
Please. Give me one more chance.

47:31.542 --> 47:33.584
I do everything perfectly.

47:33.792 --> 47:36.667
Weather, monsoon...
Ok, and then it's over.

47:36.876 --> 47:39.001
I do not have the time.
We have to find it.

47:39.209 --> 47:40.417
What is this bullshit?

47:41.376 --> 47:42.751
Oh, Bernie! You're here.

47:42.959 --> 47:43.959
I was looking for you.

47:44.042 --> 47:46.292
When I got home a while ago...

47:46.501 --> 47:47.501
What is this casting?

47:52.334 --> 47:56.667
- Girls, are you doing here?
- For the role of Kristin.

47:58.334 --> 48:01.126
Gloria's mother.
Thank you. Kiss my ass.

48:01.334 --> 48:02.834
Wait, Bernie!

48:03.667 --> 48:05.459
Bernie!

48:05.667 --> 48:08.667
Listen to me.
Gloria asked me to see her mother.

48:08.876 --> 48:12.417
- Find the real one.
- She does not give a fuck, the real one.

48:12.626 --> 48:14.626
She does not respond to Gloria's mails.

48:14.834 --> 48:17.042
"Say the truth to your daughter, fucking!"

48:17.251 --> 48:21.001
I do not want to make her unhappy.
Can you hear that?

48:21.209 --> 48:25.292
Oh, right? You think you're the
only one worrying about her?

48:25.501 --> 48:29.917
I was there for his first steps,
his first teeth, his first words!

48:30.126 --> 48:33.501
I'm not his father, but I
love him as much as you do.

48:33.709 --> 48:35.417
She will soon be 9 years old.

48:35.626 --> 48:37.626
One day, she'll understand
you're lying to him.

48:37.834 --> 48:40.751
And that's going to
make her unhappy.

48:40.959 --> 48:43.292
I know, but it freaks me out.

48:43.501 --> 48:47.167
I'm not telling you it's easy,
just that you have to do it.

48:47.376 --> 48:50.334
So, tonight, you stop
sending fake emails.

48:50.542 --> 48:52.376
And tell the truth to your daughter.

48:56.376 --> 48:57.709
It will be fine.

49:02.792 --> 49:03.876
Ho! Ho!

49:05.626 --> 49:06.959
At table, filibuster.

49:07.167 --> 49:08.501
Here is our Booty.

49:08.709 --> 49:10.292
Grilled crocodile.

49:10.501 --> 49:12.251
And its wild potatoes.

49:16.084 --> 49:17.376
Lend your knife.

49:17.584 --> 49:18.584
I'm sorry, there.

49:18.792 --> 49:19.834
Thank you.

49:29.209 --> 49:33.001
Will we talk afterwards?
I need to talk to you about something.

49:38.167 --> 49:39.376
Do not you touch it?

49:39.584 --> 49:42.001
"Yes, but I'm not very hungry."

49:46.001 --> 49:47.584
What's the matter?

49:48.667 --> 49:50.001
It's mom.

49:50.834 --> 49:53.584
She did not send me an
email this evening.

49:53.792 --> 49:55.667
This is not normal.

49:58.542 --> 49:59.751
You know, honey...

49:59.959 --> 50:01.667
"It's the first time she forgets me."

50:04.959 --> 50:07.417
Can I go to bed? I am tired.

50:09.667 --> 50:10.876
Yes if you want.

50:17.292 --> 50:19.292
We're still going to the circus tomorrow?

50:20.126 --> 50:21.876
Yeah. We'll see.

50:23.167 --> 50:24.876
Good night daddy.

51:07.709 --> 51:08.959
Oh fuck!

51:12.417 --> 51:13.459
She reads.

51:16.126 --> 51:17.292
She reads, fucking.

51:17.501 --> 51:20.667
Gloria! No... hush, shit.

51:23.185 --> 51:24.185
Hold on.

51:41.292 --> 51:42.959
Must answer, meuf!

52:01.501 --> 52:02.834
I am coming tomorrow!

52:28.626 --> 52:30.792
See you tomorrow my love.

52:39.501 --> 52:41.459
Dad, wake up!

52:41.667 --> 52:43.251
Mom will come to see me.

52:43.459 --> 52:45.209
Dad! Mom will come to see me!

52:45.417 --> 52:47.292
Dad!

52:47.501 --> 52:49.667
Mom comes to London! Oh, right?

52:49.876 --> 52:50.876
Yeah.

52:50.917 --> 52:52.709
She took wong kar-wai?

52:52.917 --> 52:53.917
I do not care. Look.

52:54.084 --> 52:55.084
She sent me an e-mail.

52:55.167 --> 52:56.209
It's awesome!

52:56.417 --> 52:58.209
Yeah! I'll see her
for the first time.

52:59.417 --> 53:00.876
I'm going to get ready.

53:01.667 --> 53:02.667
Get up, papa!

53:02.792 --> 53:04.084
We are going to be late!

53:07.042 --> 53:10.417
That. It...
Very good. All very well.

53:10.626 --> 53:12.917
"My feet are sore, papa."
Me too.

53:13.126 --> 53:14.876
I prefer the Jordan.

53:15.084 --> 53:18.584
Yes. Me too, but do not
tell your mother right away.

53:18.792 --> 53:19.959
Why?

53:20.167 --> 53:24.084
"The last time I saw her,
I was barefoot on a boat."

53:24.292 --> 53:26.092
You have to show him that
things have changed.

53:26.116 --> 53:27.575
Do you think mom will love me?

53:28.292 --> 53:30.667
"Of course!" It's your mother.

53:32.126 --> 53:35.584
"And you think she's going to love you?"
Me? So that...

53:36.542 --> 53:37.917
It's another delirium.

53:57.542 --> 53:58.751
Mom!

54:07.334 --> 54:08.792
Mom...

54:22.376 --> 54:25.251
I'm so glad to see you.

54:28.417 --> 54:30.167
Me too.

54:38.334 --> 54:39.917
Good morning, Samuel.

54:41.334 --> 54:42.417
Hello.

54:45.792 --> 54:48.917
And your sunglasses?
We'll recognize you.

54:49.126 --> 54:50.876
"Will they recognize me?"

54:51.084 --> 54:54.667
Yes...
Mum had to secure the perimeter.

54:54.876 --> 54:56.417
- That's it?
- Yes.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.167
Yes. Here.

54:58.376 --> 55:01.709
So we're connected?
I see no headset.

55:01.917 --> 55:05.376
- No, I do not have an earpiece.
- Because you do not see her.

55:05.584 --> 55:08.917
But she has a chip
directly on the eardrum.

55:09.126 --> 55:11.292
As it's inside, you
can not see it.

55:11.501 --> 55:14.626
Need a microscope.
Cool! They hear what they say?

55:14.834 --> 55:17.959
Yes, thanks to the
microphone in the tooth.

55:18.167 --> 55:20.459
It's an implant.
But there, it must be disabled.

55:20.667 --> 55:22.292
You confirm? We are.

55:22.501 --> 55:24.542
We're - cool, we're between us.

55:24.751 --> 55:26.071
What would make you
happy, Gloria?

55:26.251 --> 55:27.876
Do you want to eat ice cream?

55:28.084 --> 55:30.501
Walk around?
What do you want to do?

55:30.709 --> 55:31.709
It was planned.

55:31.876 --> 55:33.209
To go to the circus.

55:33.417 --> 55:35.751
If you want to eat ice cream,

55:35.959 --> 55:38.251
do it in the meantime.
As you wish.

55:38.459 --> 55:40.042
I'd like to show you my room.

55:41.084 --> 55:42.959
I'd love to see your room.

55:43.167 --> 55:44.417
"Can we, papa?"

55:45.834 --> 55:47.792
- Can we please?
- Yes.

55:48.001 --> 55:50.084
Yeah! Lets' go.

55:51.376 --> 55:52.959
Come on!

55:53.167 --> 55:56.417
That fuck up the circus
program, but we can...

55:58.292 --> 56:01.417
You have to explain the
earpiece and all that.

56:02.167 --> 56:05.667
You, you have to explain
the taxi and all that.

56:15.251 --> 56:16.876
Welcome.

56:18.042 --> 56:20.251
It's incredible here.

56:20.459 --> 56:23.834
"But it's up there, my room."
You come?

56:27.751 --> 56:30.459
I have a whole wall of lego.
No...

56:30.667 --> 56:31.959
If I swear to you.

56:35.876 --> 56:38.667
That's my dinosaurs. Here.

56:38.876 --> 56:41.084
That's my shark.

56:41.292 --> 56:43.917
And that's my giraffe
from Madagascar.

56:44.126 --> 56:46.167
"You went to Madagascar?"
- No.

56:46.376 --> 56:47.376
It is a cartoon.

56:48.167 --> 56:49.626
You do not know?

56:49.834 --> 56:52.042
But I did not see him.

56:52.251 --> 56:53.917
Mom has no time to
watch the movies.

56:54.126 --> 56:55.542
She knows the country. Hey?

56:55.751 --> 56:56.459
Yes.

56:56.667 --> 56:57.417
Oh, right?

56:57.626 --> 56:59.417
I did not know you were there.
Oh yes.

56:59.626 --> 57:00.626
Did you meet who?

57:01.667 --> 57:02.709
Uh...

57:03.917 --> 57:04.917
Eddie Murphy.

57:05.977 --> 57:06.977
<i>'Who </i> ?

57:07.001 --> 57:10.209
Eddie Murphy.
He was in the Beverly hills cop,

57:11.501 --> 57:12.876
<i>in an armchair for two.</i>

57:13.084 --> 57:15.417
She did not see that. She is 8 years old.

57:15.626 --> 57:17.584
It was in doctor dol / file.

57:18.751 --> 57:20.959
She saw that. No? She knows?

57:21.167 --> 57:22.167
Eddie Murphy.

57:22.209 --> 57:23.251
It <i>is</i> in <i>Shrek.</i>

57:23.459 --> 57:24.542
Remember the donkey?

57:24.751 --> 57:26.126
It's his voice.

57:26.334 --> 57:27.334
Ah yes!

57:27.376 --> 57:29.459
"You definitely you need a tic tac.

57:29.667 --> 57:32.084
"Your breath stinks!" Here!

57:32.292 --> 57:33.792
She has an American accent.

57:34.001 --> 57:35.167
For a little English girl.

57:35.357 --> 57:36.477
She learned with the movies.

57:36.501 --> 57:39.001
She goes to the French school in London.
There is a good level.

57:39.209 --> 57:40.376
That is true?

57:40.584 --> 57:42.001
Your school is far away?

57:42.209 --> 57:43.709
No. We'll go tomorrow.

57:43.917 --> 57:45.459
You'll see my naughty teacher.

57:45.667 --> 57:47.167
"An naughty teacher?"

57:47.376 --> 57:48.667
Why naughty?

57:48.876 --> 57:51.459
I do not like her, she never laughs.

57:51.667 --> 57:53.001
He's a good teacher?

57:53.667 --> 57:56.792
Yes.
If you love depressive witches.

57:57.001 --> 57:59.709
Depressive witches, can't wait to meet her.

58:14.834 --> 58:17.834
She fell asleep at once.
No problem.

58:18.042 --> 58:19.626
It's all her.

58:22.876 --> 58:24.959
Why did not you
tell him the truth?

58:26.251 --> 58:28.001
I thought about it, yeah.

58:28.209 --> 58:31.667
But even looking good, I
have not found it correctly.

58:31.876 --> 58:34.042
To explain to him that his
mother had abandoned him.

58:34.876 --> 58:39.542
Even you, you prefer to be the
secret mamma that I invented. No?

58:44.292 --> 58:46.584
You made her a
wonderful little girl.

58:46.792 --> 58:48.959
I did not do it for you.

58:51.959 --> 58:55.542
- It was not easy, you know.
- Are you kidding?

58:55.751 --> 58:58.667
You left us like shit!

58:58.876 --> 59:01.501
We'll forgive you because
you answered a mail?

59:01.709 --> 59:03.542
I'm not asking you.

59:03.751 --> 59:06.042
I know it's unforgivable,
what I did.

59:06.251 --> 59:07.626
"Then why did you do it?"

59:07.834 --> 59:10.626
I was lost.
I was doing anything.

59:12.251 --> 59:14.126
When I got pregnant,

59:14.334 --> 59:18.334
I thought I could get away with
it, but it got worse and worse.

59:18.542 --> 59:21.167
I could not impose that on a baby.

59:21.376 --> 59:24.292
A baby blues and you leave your
daughter to a guy who has jumped you!

59:24.501 --> 59:25.542
"To his father."

59:30.626 --> 59:32.417
I knew you'd be up to it.

59:32.626 --> 59:35.126
It lasted 8 years.
You know what it's like, eight?

59:36.667 --> 59:38.459
It's an eternity.

59:42.084 --> 59:45.001
I've been thinking of her
every day for 8 years.

59:45.209 --> 59:48.501
It's been 8 years since I was
ashamed, it's been 8 years since...

59:50.376 --> 59:53.292
That I tell myself that my
daughter will ever forgive me.

59:54.667 --> 59:57.042
I was afraid, and the
more time passed,

59:57.251 --> 01:00:00.501
the more I was afraid, because
a mother like me, we hate her.

01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:02.001
That's easy.

01:00:02.209 --> 01:00:03.459
No, it's not easy.

01:00:06.584 --> 01:00:08.024
I come back from a distance, Samuel.

01:00:11.292 --> 01:00:13.751
But thanks to you, I
have existed, for her.

01:00:16.917 --> 01:00:18.292
Thank you.

01:00:32.626 --> 01:00:34.417
You got a place to sleep?

01:00:36.126 --> 01:00:38.459
I'll find a hotel.

01:00:39.167 --> 01:00:41.292
You can stay here
tonight, if you want to.

01:00:41.501 --> 01:00:43.126
That is true?

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:46.126
Yeah. It will make him happy.

01:01:22.376 --> 01:01:25.459
- And hop! Hi mom!
- Ah, you won.

01:01:25.667 --> 01:01:27.667
- Yeah.
- Hello. Are you ready?

01:01:27.876 --> 01:01:29.459
Yeah, yeah. I got up early.

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:32.209
- Checkpoint!
- 8h16.

01:01:32.417 --> 01:01:33.584
We got a minute!

01:01:33.792 --> 01:01:34.876
- Laces.
- Laces.

01:01:35.084 --> 01:01:36.126
Slept well?

01:01:36.334 --> 01:01:38.959
Yes. I prepared a
breakfast for Gloria.

01:01:39.167 --> 01:01:41.209
Mom, we never eat here in the morning.

01:01:42.167 --> 01:01:45.084
Yeah. We prefer to sleep
more and eat on the way.

01:01:46.001 --> 01:01:47.834
Checkpoint!
- 8h17.

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:49.417
- Jacket.
- Jacket.

01:01:49.626 --> 01:01:50.667
Vitamins.

01:01:50.876 --> 01:01:53.084
- Hop!
- Thank you.

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:55.001
We're ready. You come?

01:01:55.209 --> 01:01:56.834
Yes. We leave all this here?

01:01:57.042 --> 01:01:58.209
There are eggs, muffins.

01:01:58.417 --> 01:01:59.459
Even chouquettes.

01:02:00.042 --> 01:02:01.417
Oh yeah anyway.

01:02:01.626 --> 01:02:02.626
We got it.

01:02:02.709 --> 01:02:03.709
And dinner too.

01:02:04.501 --> 01:02:05.501
Checkpoint?

01:02:05.626 --> 01:02:07.334
- 8h18.
- Perfect.

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:09.917
Backpack.

01:02:10.917 --> 01:02:12.209
Um yes.

01:02:44.042 --> 01:02:45.334
Good morning, Gloria.

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:46.667
Hello madam.

01:02:46.876 --> 01:02:47.876
It is my mother.

01:02:48.042 --> 01:02:49.209
Hello madam.

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:51.751
I am the director
of the institution.

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:55.167
Glad to meet you at last.
Me too.

01:02:55.376 --> 01:02:56.976
"Come on, mamma, I'll
show you my class."

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.584
- Bye madam.
- Goodbye.

01:02:58.792 --> 01:03:00.042
Goodbye.

01:03:03.751 --> 01:03:05.584
"She paid for the
taxi and came back."

01:03:06.959 --> 01:03:10.001
The driver had no money...

01:03:11.376 --> 01:03:14.001
I have the episodes
of next week.

01:03:14.209 --> 01:03:16.834
I do not know if you saw them.

01:03:21.084 --> 01:03:24.126
"Sit in silence, please."

01:03:27.126 --> 01:03:29.209
Hello madam. I'm Gloria's mom.

01:03:29.417 --> 01:03:31.334
No parents in the class.

01:03:31.542 --> 01:03:32.751
It is the rule.

01:03:32.959 --> 01:03:34.167
Of course. Sorry.

01:03:34.376 --> 01:03:37.667
- Sorry.
- And again, she's cool.

01:03:38.751 --> 01:03:41.191
"Are you coming for me tonight?"
If you want. At what time?

01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:42.876
- Normally...
- 15h30.

01:03:43.084 --> 01:03:45.001
It's written here. Just read.

01:03:45.209 --> 01:03:46.876
Gloria?

01:03:49.084 --> 01:03:51.417
- We hate her. No?
- Yeah.

01:03:56.084 --> 01:03:58.584
Good. By the time Gloria settled down,

01:03:58.792 --> 01:04:00.667
you can open the notebooks.

01:04:00.876 --> 01:04:04.917
Today we are going to talk
about the solar system:

01:04:05.126 --> 01:04:09.209
The earth, the moon... Gloria.

01:04:09.417 --> 01:04:10.417
Thank you.

01:04:27.792 --> 01:04:30.251
Why are we here, Bernie?

01:04:30.459 --> 01:04:31.626
The view is sublime.

01:04:31.834 --> 01:04:33.584
- What?
- Get out of here, please.

01:04:35.084 --> 01:04:36.584
Hello sir.

01:04:38.042 --> 01:04:40.376
Did monsieur make his choice of tea?

01:04:44.126 --> 01:04:45.417
Yes...

01:04:46.042 --> 01:04:47.417
<i>A dis-z 'coke.</i>

01:04:47.626 --> 01:04:48.834
I am sorry, sir.

01:04:49.042 --> 01:04:51.042
We do not serve colas.

01:04:51.251 --> 01:04:53.209
Get some tea, shit.
The tradition.

01:04:53.417 --> 01:04:55.876
I knew it was a rough place.

01:04:56.084 --> 01:04:58.209
I was sure of it.

01:05:00.251 --> 01:05:01.417
An ice tea.

01:05:01.626 --> 01:05:02.626
Sorry?

01:05:02.709 --> 01:05:03.709
My god.

01:05:03.834 --> 01:05:05.917
Tea with ice in it.

01:05:06.126 --> 01:05:08.251
Tea with ice, inside.

01:05:08.709 --> 01:05:10.751
It's tea, it's not a.

01:05:10.959 --> 01:05:12.876
It's not a - no.

01:05:13.084 --> 01:05:15.876
"I am confused, sir.
He is French."

01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:17.084
It's tea.

01:05:17.167 --> 01:05:18.376
It's not a colas.

01:05:18.584 --> 01:05:21.251
Yes, we understood that. Oh...

01:05:22.959 --> 01:05:25.167
"Are you gonna check
it all afternoon?"

01:05:25.376 --> 01:05:28.501
"He comes here every Thursday."
He makes me his show.

01:05:28.709 --> 01:05:30.251
He drives me crazy.

01:05:33.084 --> 01:05:34.417
"This father of a family?"

01:05:34.626 --> 01:05:37.542
It's a blanket!
He's gay. It shows.

01:05:37.751 --> 01:05:39.042
You got drunk.

01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.251
What?

01:05:40.292 --> 01:05:43.667
Your chandeliers at 6 billion, your
tea, your papas dep, it's too much.

01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:45.376
It's okay. Take a seat.

01:05:45.584 --> 01:05:46.824
You do not even listen to me.

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:48.417
- Tell me about it.
- Tell what?

01:05:48.626 --> 01:05:49.626
About Kristin.

01:05:49.792 --> 01:05:52.501
If she comes fuck shit in the
family, it's not worth it.

01:05:53.501 --> 01:05:55.042
You're having a fit of jealousy.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:58.542
Nothing to see.
It's just that I see you more.

01:05:58.751 --> 01:05:59.501
It's been 2 days.

01:05:59.709 --> 01:06:01.469
- It's too much.
- It pleases the little one.

01:06:01.542 --> 01:06:05.501
I have a say.
I'm a little bit like that child's mother.

01:06:05.709 --> 01:06:06.709
Stopped.

01:06:06.917 --> 01:06:08.126
More than her.

01:06:08.334 --> 01:06:10.417
Do not worry. She's lost.

01:06:10.626 --> 01:06:12.459
She came to see Gloria
and she will leave.

01:06:12.667 --> 01:06:14.792
"But she is sleeping at home."

01:06:15.792 --> 01:06:17.292
You laid back with her?

01:06:17.501 --> 01:06:18.501
"I'm not fine?"

01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:20.751
- She is big?
- Oh, no.

01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:23.084
You laid back with her!

01:06:23.292 --> 01:06:25.751
I was sure of it.
Stop with that!

01:06:25.959 --> 01:06:27.501
She stays with Gloria.

01:06:29.126 --> 01:06:31.917
You promise me that there is not
an ounce of seduction between you.

01:06:32.667 --> 01:06:34.459
Not an iota.

01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:39.292
That's right, people
say I'm a stuntman.

01:06:39.501 --> 01:06:40.542
That is true.

01:06:40.751 --> 01:06:43.501
Let's say that the
cinema has fallen on me.

01:06:43.709 --> 01:06:45.334
And I fall in the movies.

01:06:45.542 --> 01:06:46.834
Stuntman.

01:06:47.042 --> 01:06:51.376
Tom cruise, jacky chan, bébel...
<i>'Who</i> ?

01:06:52.167 --> 01:06:53.501
Belmondo, Jean-Paul.

01:06:56.917 --> 01:06:59.834
If you want a picture
of your lovely family...

01:07:00.042 --> 01:07:01.376
Thank you.

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:03.917
What's the matter?

01:07:05.334 --> 01:07:08.834
Nothing. He says we're
a lovely little family.

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:10.251
Oh, right?

01:07:12.792 --> 01:07:14.667
It is true that it is not false.

01:07:17.459 --> 01:07:18.917
Why not?

01:07:21.709 --> 01:07:23.876
No, because I have someone.

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.084
Ah super.

01:07:28.292 --> 01:07:30.584
We met four years ago in New York.
It is serious.

01:07:30.792 --> 01:07:32.209
We live together.

01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:34.251
He's a very good person.

01:07:34.459 --> 01:07:36.626
It's thanks to him... it's cool.

01:07:36.834 --> 01:07:38.626
That I got out...

01:07:42.167 --> 01:07:44.626
I did not dare tell you about
it, but it just happened.

01:07:44.834 --> 01:07:46.542
In London and...

01:07:46.751 --> 01:07:48.501
I would like to present it to you.

01:07:49.376 --> 01:07:51.001
Great boss. It's cool.

01:07:51.959 --> 01:07:53.417
Very cool.

01:07:54.417 --> 01:07:58.209
- Well, if it's possible. Me I...
- Yes it's possible.

01:07:58.417 --> 01:08:02.001
We need to organize, what.
But it is possible.

01:08:03.042 --> 01:08:04.209
No problem.

01:08:12.959 --> 01:08:14.167
Here, Gloria.

01:08:15.626 --> 01:08:17.167
What? He's there?

01:08:18.626 --> 01:08:20.209
Ah yes, he's there.

01:08:29.959 --> 01:08:32.001
Hello. You must be Gloria.

01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:33.667
Yes.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:34.876
Hello.

01:08:35.084 --> 01:08:36.959
And you're... Samuel, right?

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:38.376
Right...

01:08:43.126 --> 01:08:46.417
Lowell. I prefer om. Sorry.

01:08:47.584 --> 01:08:48.751
What?

01:08:48.959 --> 01:08:51.709
Uh... Ol, om, teams.

01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:53.376
- Soccer.
- Ah, football.

01:08:53.584 --> 01:08:54.584
That's it.

01:08:54.751 --> 01:08:55.751
Paris Saint germain.

01:08:55.792 --> 01:08:57.626
No. I prefer the other.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.084
I prefer om.

01:08:59.834 --> 01:09:01.292
He does not speak English.

01:09:01.501 --> 01:09:05.209
Yes, of course. Hold on. He speaks.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:06.709
Sometimes a little.

01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:08.251
Sometimes, no.

01:09:08.459 --> 01:09:09.834
It depends, in fact.

01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:12.751
It depends, but he speaks.
Of course.

01:09:12.959 --> 01:09:14.626
What do you think?

01:09:14.834 --> 01:09:17.376
Well, do you sit in there?

01:09:17.584 --> 01:09:19.334
We'll be better. No?

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.709
Yes.

01:09:20.917 --> 01:09:22.626
- What do you think?
- Yes.

01:09:22.834 --> 01:09:23.501
Say it.

01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:25.001
Sit in it.

01:09:25.209 --> 01:09:27.001
It's good. Come on!

01:09:27.209 --> 01:09:30.542
My dad is the best man ever.
Everyone wants to work with him.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:33.209
You know Jack bates?

01:09:33.417 --> 01:09:34.417
Of course.

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:35.667
Well, it's him.

01:09:35.876 --> 01:09:36.667
Oh, right?

01:09:36.876 --> 01:09:38.459
It's me!

01:09:39.959 --> 01:09:42.084
"And the real actor in the series?"

01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:45.084
"The only risk he takes
is smoking cigarettes."

01:09:45.292 --> 01:09:46.751
Dad does all the rest.

01:09:46.959 --> 01:09:49.459
Wow! That is pretty impressive.

01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:51.167
Yes, I am!

01:09:54.209 --> 01:09:56.792
- You did not want to go to the bathroom?
- Yes.

01:09:57.001 --> 01:09:58.251
Me too. Let's go.

01:09:58.751 --> 01:10:00.209
We will be back.

01:10:00.417 --> 01:10:01.417
Ok.

01:10:20.876 --> 01:10:23.667
I love "bucu" "the" France.

01:10:24.251 --> 01:10:25.376
What?

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:29.209
"France. I like "bucu".

01:10:29.917 --> 01:10:32.084
"Ah! Okay.

01:10:32.292 --> 01:10:33.876
"The" France, yes.

01:10:34.084 --> 01:10:35.084
Okay. So...

01:10:35.292 --> 01:10:37.667
You like "bucu" tout "le" France.

01:10:37.876 --> 01:10:40.334
Or a part of "the" France?

01:10:41.542 --> 01:10:42.542
What?

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:47.167
I like "bucu"
the south of "the" France.

01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:50.334
The "zaousse".

01:10:50.542 --> 01:10:51.876
The "zaousse"?

01:10:52.084 --> 01:10:55.417
Yes, the "zaousse".
At the seaside.

01:10:55.626 --> 01:10:57.584
Ok... the south.

01:10:57.792 --> 01:10:59.334
That's what I said.

01:11:01.251 --> 01:11:02.709
The "zaousse"!

01:11:03.251 --> 01:11:04.251
Very good.

01:11:04.459 --> 01:11:06.542
Yeah, very good.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:09.457
He does not care about me.

01:11:12.959 --> 01:11:14.167
He does not care about me.

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:17.084
There is a toilet
for 300 people.

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:22.709
"Why do you prefer
lowell more than daddy?"

01:11:24.584 --> 01:11:26.251
But I never said that.

01:11:27.292 --> 01:11:31.626
No, but if you thought the other way
around, you'd be at home with us.

01:11:33.251 --> 01:11:37.251
We can see each other without
living in the same house.

01:11:37.876 --> 01:11:40.084
It does not mean we love each other less.

01:11:41.417 --> 01:11:42.626
Okay?

01:11:46.917 --> 01:11:48.792
Look at me, Gloria.

01:11:52.084 --> 01:11:54.459
I'll never leave you.

01:11:55.709 --> 01:11:57.126
Okay?

01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.792
I promise you.

01:12:04.209 --> 01:12:06.709
Come here, come.

01:12:16.626 --> 01:12:20.501
Can I avoid kids clothes
when I have a thermal suit?

01:12:20.709 --> 01:12:23.209
- Hi, my cat.
- It would be good.

01:12:23.417 --> 01:12:24.709
Whore! Shit!

01:12:24.917 --> 01:12:26.834
- Thank you.
- Thank you!

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:29.126
1000 hours to dress!

01:12:29.334 --> 01:12:32.292
Whore! This is the end of the day!
"Stop there!"

01:12:32.501 --> 01:12:35.126
It's not our fault that
Kristin has a guy.

01:12:35.334 --> 01:12:37.959
Nothing to see. I do not
understand what she finds.

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:40.167
- He's fat?
- Not especially.

01:12:40.376 --> 01:12:42.709
It's a little disgusting little bastard.

01:12:42.917 --> 01:12:44.501
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:45.834
Dad, I have a surprise.

01:12:49.876 --> 01:12:51.584
Is this sublime guy?

01:12:52.876 --> 01:12:54.834
I'll die, he has
the tom Ford news.

01:12:55.042 --> 01:12:56.042
He is small.

01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:57.876
Can I talk to you, Gloria?

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:01.417
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:13:01.626 --> 01:13:04.334
Gloria insisted.
Is not that a problem?

01:13:04.542 --> 01:13:07.334
Well, you know. In fact no.
Sorry excuse me.

01:13:07.542 --> 01:13:08.709
Without warning,

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:11.209
it is complicated.
There are standards.

01:13:11.417 --> 01:13:13.167
Hein... hey, Bernie?

01:13:13.376 --> 01:13:16.459
Secured, insurance...
It is cheese. No?

01:13:17.834 --> 01:13:19.209
Cheese? Not really.

01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:21.584
- Okay.
- Do not worry.

01:13:21.792 --> 01:13:24.626
Me, it's Bernie, the producer.
Nice to meet you.

01:13:26.167 --> 01:13:28.751
We'll set you up to look at me.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:30.376
It is fabulous. You will see.

01:13:30.584 --> 01:13:32.626
Be my guest, I'll be there in a minute.

01:13:32.834 --> 01:13:33.834
Over there?

01:13:33.876 --> 01:13:37.251
Be the guest... No problem.

01:13:39.501 --> 01:13:41.792
On the other hand I
reassure you, he's gay.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.459
Stop please.

01:13:43.667 --> 01:13:45.334
"Why is he here?"

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:46.626
To watch us.

01:13:46.834 --> 01:13:50.042
"He may like stuntmen."
That's it.

01:13:50.251 --> 01:13:52.209
All is said.

01:13:54.209 --> 01:13:55.209
Perfect!

01:13:55.417 --> 01:13:56.417
But even more.

01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:57.792
It must burn alive.

01:13:58.001 --> 01:13:58.667
Glo!

01:13:58.876 --> 01:14:01.042
Come and see, dear.

01:14:01.834 --> 01:14:03.417
I do not feel it, the scene.

01:14:03.626 --> 01:14:06.917
You ask them to leave the
1st floor, not the 3rd?

01:14:07.126 --> 01:14:09.917
Hey? We'll play it soft.
I do not know, it's...

01:14:10.126 --> 01:14:11.542
A feeling.

01:14:11.751 --> 01:14:14.501
- Okay, I'm asking.
- Thank you darling.

01:14:17.376 --> 01:14:18.667
I love what you do.

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:20.626
It's great to meet you.

01:14:20.834 --> 01:14:23.959
This is the most important
scene of the season.

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:27.042
A big waterfall.
Bates jumps from a building on fire.

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:29.334
Samuel will jump from up there.

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:32.376
That is really?

01:14:33.334 --> 01:14:36.751
Is not little bit dangerous?
"Yes, that is the point."

01:14:38.917 --> 01:14:40.251
Do not worry about him.

01:14:40.459 --> 01:14:42.084
From the 3rd floor, kid could do it.

01:14:42.292 --> 01:14:43.792
I thought it is the 6th?

01:14:44.001 --> 01:14:46.334
That would be great,
but I doubt he'll be great.

01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:48.751
"He says he wants to
do it from more."

01:14:48.959 --> 01:14:50.709
"Would he jump off the 6th floor?"

01:14:50.917 --> 01:14:51.917
No.

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:54.042
From the 11th floor.

01:14:55.352 --> 01:14:56.352
"11th?"

01:14:56.376 --> 01:14:57.751
This is the top floor.

01:14:57.959 --> 01:15:00.584
"He wants to show my mother
how courageous he is."

01:15:00.792 --> 01:15:01.542
Ok.

01:15:01.751 --> 01:15:02.951
OK, that's great. Let's do it!

01:15:03.017 --> 01:15:04.876
You are the man, Sam!

01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.084
Here!

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.542
One floor, we agree.
Thank you my friend.

01:15:08.751 --> 01:15:10.792
We're gonna rip everything up.

01:15:12.001 --> 01:15:14.084
It's exciting, is not it?

01:15:14.667 --> 01:15:15.792
OK guys, let's go!

01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:18.167
We're going up.

01:15:33.042 --> 01:15:35.001
Hold on. What are you doing?

01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:38.209
What are you doing?

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:40.167
One, I said "one."

01:15:40.584 --> 01:15:41.584
You said eleven.

01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:44.376
Eleven? You're maboul or what?
No way.

01:15:44.584 --> 01:15:45.709
No no. Stop!

01:15:45.917 --> 01:15:48.209
Stop that. Chopped off. Chopped off.

01:15:48.417 --> 01:15:49.876
I do not have control.

01:15:50.084 --> 01:15:50.626
Stopped.

01:15:50.834 --> 01:15:51.876
It's automated.

01:15:52.084 --> 01:15:53.751
What, "totomatisé"? Stop that.

01:15:53.959 --> 01:15:54.751
Stop I.

01:15:54.959 --> 01:15:56.876
Never will I jump
eleven stories on fire!

01:15:57.084 --> 01:15:58.459
You realize?

01:15:58.667 --> 01:16:00.334
Do not shout at me.

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:02.709
I'm feeling dizzy, please.

01:16:02.917 --> 01:16:04.459
Are you ready?

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:05.751
Almost.

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:06.626
Great!

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:07.834
<i>Cameras?.</i>

01:16:08.001 --> 01:16:10.084
No no no! Cut!

01:16:10.292 --> 01:16:11.042
Cut!

01:16:11.251 --> 01:16:12.417
Cut that!

01:16:12.626 --> 01:16:16.167
I do not move if I'm not
on the 1st floor. Ok?

01:16:18.084 --> 01:16:19.376
He wants to do it from the 1st.

01:16:19.584 --> 01:16:22.459
What? You kidding? What a fuck?

01:16:23.251 --> 01:16:24.501
Gloria, a word please.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:30.876
We had an agreement.
You said he would jump from the 11th.

01:16:31.084 --> 01:16:32.626
"What's he doing to her?"

01:16:32.834 --> 01:16:36.126
He does not care about me?
It's not the empire state building!

01:16:36.334 --> 01:16:37.459
What's he doing?

01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:40.751
Your daughter said eleven. She lied.

01:16:40.959 --> 01:16:41.959
Hold on!

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:43.292
Stop! Okay?

01:16:43.501 --> 01:16:46.126
You do not talk to her like that.
She's my daughter.

01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:49.001
He said what?
What he says to me now?

01:16:49.209 --> 01:16:50.289
You translate or you gland?

01:16:50.459 --> 01:16:52.876
Hold on... He is a
stuntman or a performer?

01:16:53.084 --> 01:16:55.542
What is he: Man or a mouse?
I am a guru!

01:16:55.751 --> 01:16:57.917
I will do it! Ok for 11.

01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:59.501
Tell him "ok for 11."

01:16:59.709 --> 01:17:00.751
She's not lying.

01:17:01.876 --> 01:17:04.251
"He's going to jump off the top floor."

01:17:04.459 --> 01:17:05.792
Bring the airbags!

01:17:06.001 --> 01:17:08.709
I do not have time to deal with this creep.

01:17:08.917 --> 01:17:10.042
Lets' go.

01:17:25.042 --> 01:17:26.834
Fuck, Gloria.

01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.001
"Be quiet!"

01:17:34.501 --> 01:17:36.626
cameras!

01:17:43.001 --> 01:17:44.667
8-176. One.

01:17:45.602 --> 01:17:47.709
Action!

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:49.292
Action!

01:18:05.417 --> 01:18:06.917
Cut.

01:18:07.126 --> 01:18:08.126
Sublime!

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.084
He's not moving.

01:18:13.292 --> 01:18:15.917
My god! Call Emergency!

01:18:23.959 --> 01:18:25.167
Let it pass.

01:18:25.376 --> 01:18:26.834
I'm here.

01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:29.042
No help, he just needs me.

01:18:31.834 --> 01:18:33.251
Dad.

01:18:33.459 --> 01:18:35.709
Awake, you are immortal.

01:18:43.459 --> 01:18:44.626
Dad.

01:18:44.834 --> 01:18:46.667
Awake, you are immortal.

01:18:52.167 --> 01:18:53.459
Papa 'g.

01:18:53.667 --> 01:18:54.959
Sam, answer.

01:18:56.126 --> 01:18:57.334
It' ok mate?

01:19:02.792 --> 01:19:04.251
Yes I am!

01:19:06.667 --> 01:19:07.751
Too strong!

01:19:07.959 --> 01:19:09.209
He is alive!

01:19:10.501 --> 01:19:11.584
He is alive!

01:19:12.917 --> 01:19:13.917
Thank you.

01:19:13.959 --> 01:19:15.876
"But speak more like that
to my daughter." Ok?

01:19:16.876 --> 01:19:18.667
Yeah, okay. Back to work!

01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:19.876
Back to work!

01:19:20.042 --> 01:19:23.251
- Come on, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks. It's okay.

01:19:32.001 --> 01:19:33.126
It will be fine?

01:19:40.917 --> 01:19:44.459
Did she tell you what in the ear?
It's a game between us.

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:47.227
I pretend to be dead.
She thinks she is bringing me back to life.

01:19:48.917 --> 01:19:50.417
Another lie.

01:19:51.834 --> 01:19:53.709
That's it. Another lie.

01:19:57.001 --> 01:19:59.667
"What will happen
when she finds out?"

01:19:59.876 --> 01:20:01.709
"You give me lessons?" You?

01:20:01.917 --> 01:20:04.334
"No, but one day she'll grow up."

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:06.626
Stop please.

01:20:11.459 --> 01:20:13.542
I want to tell him the truth about me.

01:20:13.751 --> 01:20:15.584
It would be better for her.

01:20:15.792 --> 01:20:18.751
For her? You do not
know what's good for her.

01:20:18.959 --> 01:20:20.334
You know nothing.

01:20:20.542 --> 01:20:24.084
So you're not going to say anything at all.
We forget this conversation.

01:20:24.292 --> 01:20:25.876
I am going to rest. I am tired.

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:27.667
I'm going to mix in the countries.

01:20:27.876 --> 01:20:28.876
I do not know Obama.

01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:32.376
I'm not a secret agent!
That is the truth!

01:21:23.292 --> 01:21:24.584
Thank you so much.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:25.792
See you soon.

01:21:25.917 --> 01:21:27.501
Yes, very soon.

01:21:32.626 --> 01:21:36.126
- Goodbye, Gloria.
- No, I want to come with you.

01:21:36.334 --> 01:21:38.042
We'll go see mom tomorrow.

01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:40.876
I'm not talking to you.
You liar!

01:21:41.084 --> 01:21:42.626
Calm down, darling...

01:21:42.834 --> 01:21:44.876
I do not want to go with you!

01:21:45.084 --> 01:21:47.084
I want to go with you, mom.

01:21:54.042 --> 01:21:56.167
Well, come on, we'll talk...

01:21:57.084 --> 01:21:58.376
I will call you tomorrow.

01:22:21.167 --> 01:22:22.292
Started.

01:22:38.501 --> 01:22:40.709
You do not want to sleep at home?

01:22:41.584 --> 01:22:42.709
With you?

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.209
Yeah...
A small head-spade to the old.

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:49.334
Not sure if it makes
me feel better.

01:22:49.542 --> 01:22:53.334
Do not worry. A good night's
sleep on it, it'll be fine.

01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:56.376
This is the first time I
will not put him to sleep.

01:22:56.584 --> 01:23:00.542
She's coming back.
Just give him a little time.

01:23:02.792 --> 01:23:04.376
I do not have time.

01:23:05.376 --> 01:23:08.584
Yeah, I know, buddy. I know.

01:23:16.417 --> 01:23:18.501
Come on... beers.

01:23:55.376 --> 01:23:58.709
Hello, it's Kristin.
Leave a message, thanks.

01:25:07.292 --> 01:25:08.751
How is she?

01:25:08.959 --> 01:25:10.917
"She falls asleep always so quickly."

01:25:11.126 --> 01:25:14.917
I do not understand. It's
against you she should be angry.

01:25:15.126 --> 01:25:18.667
Today she asked to see you.
He misses you.

01:25:19.376 --> 01:25:21.959
Must go in and everything
is the same as before.

01:25:22.959 --> 01:25:24.959
It may not be like before.

01:25:25.167 --> 01:25:26.626
That is to say?

01:25:26.834 --> 01:25:31.251
Things have changed.
We will find an equitable solution.

01:25:31.459 --> 01:25:34.792
Stopped. I raised her.
It will never be fair.

01:25:35.001 --> 01:25:38.501
I'd like to see her more.
Catch up the time I lost.

01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:41.917
"Yes, when you pass in the
corner, you call us!"

01:25:42.126 --> 01:25:43.834
Go on Facebook, now
that you master.

01:25:44.042 --> 01:25:46.002
"Stop, I should like to
have it also at my house."

01:25:46.026 --> 01:25:47.026
Habites is in New York!

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:48.334
We can get organized.

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:51.167
No! My daughter and I
are very well organized.

01:25:51.376 --> 01:25:54.417
There are lots of happy
children with separated parents.

01:25:54.626 --> 01:25:58.001
And full of happy children,
alone with their father!

01:25:58.209 --> 01:26:01.042
You give me a second chance.
I seized her.

01:26:01.251 --> 01:26:05.001
I gave you nothing.
I allowed Gloria to see her mother.

01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:07.626
"Now I am here, I
am his mother."

01:26:07.834 --> 01:26:10.084
You're gonna take her out and
stop me from seeing her?

01:26:13.376 --> 01:26:16.292
We will not go so far as to
settle this before a judge.

01:26:16.501 --> 01:26:20.251
A judge? Are we in there?
It goes to the penal, downright!

01:26:20.459 --> 01:26:21.917
Ben. Go ahead!

01:26:22.126 --> 01:26:24.667
Go and tell everything to your judge!
He'll love it!

01:26:24.876 --> 01:26:27.084
Meanwhile, Gloria stays with me!

01:26:27.292 --> 01:26:29.167
His house is here,

01:26:29.376 --> 01:26:31.376
his school is here, his life is here!

01:26:31.584 --> 01:26:33.292
End of the discussion.

01:26:33.501 --> 01:26:35.501
We stop the bullshit!

01:26:36.376 --> 01:26:38.459
- Hi, Sam.
- Shut up!

01:26:43.042 --> 01:26:44.584
It's me, darling.

01:26:45.751 --> 01:26:48.542
We go home now.

01:26:53.167 --> 01:26:55.209
You're doing a lot of bullshit.

01:26:55.417 --> 01:26:57.876
You did it eight years ago.
It's too late.

01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:05.917
Now you have more choice.

01:27:08.584 --> 01:27:09.959
Sir.

01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:28.084
Excuse me, my dear.

01:27:29.376 --> 01:27:31.459
I did not want to lie to you.

01:27:32.126 --> 01:27:33.709
It was for your good.

01:27:34.917 --> 01:27:39.167
Sometimes, for the good of the
people, you have to lie a little.

01:27:42.084 --> 01:27:44.709
Everything will go
back as before.

01:28:15.209 --> 01:28:16.417
Good morning everyone.

01:28:16.626 --> 01:28:18.876
We are gathered here today.

01:28:19.084 --> 01:28:21.876
To Kristin Stuart.

01:28:22.084 --> 01:28:23.542
VS Samuel Abelli,

01:28:23.751 --> 01:28:26.459
to determine custody,

01:28:26.667 --> 01:28:29.126
Of their eight-year-old daughter, Gloria.

01:28:29.334 --> 01:28:30.876
The mother will speak first.

01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:33.417
Ms. Stuart, step forward.

01:28:33.792 --> 01:28:34.792
It will be fine.

01:28:36.334 --> 01:28:37.814
He was preparing that, the bastard.

01:28:37.838 --> 01:28:39.209
And he's getting the lawyer.

01:28:39.417 --> 01:28:41.042
I should have known.

01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:43.959
I'm going to get screwed in English.
I will understand nothing.

01:28:44.167 --> 01:28:45.292
Tell the truth.

01:28:45.501 --> 01:28:48.621
No I can not... put on
your headset, then.

01:28:48.792 --> 01:28:52.459
- What?
- For English. Put on your headset.

01:28:52.876 --> 01:28:56.251
- Which channel, French?
- 5.

01:28:56.459 --> 01:28:57.542
You're welcome.

01:29:01.209 --> 01:29:06.626
"I know it's unforgivable
to abandon your child."

01:29:07.876 --> 01:29:08.876
I understad that.

01:29:09.876 --> 01:29:14.084
That my past actions can not
be excused or undone.

01:29:16.542 --> 01:29:18.792
But I do not want to
lose my daughter again.

01:29:22.459 --> 01:29:24.001
I'd like to thank Samuel.

01:29:29.751 --> 01:29:32.417
He's been wonderful father...

01:29:33.667 --> 01:29:35.876
I wish I had not come this far.

01:29:38.667 --> 01:29:42.667
I can never make up the lost years,
and I live with that every day.

01:29:44.001 --> 01:29:45.767
But I want to be mother to my daugter now.

01:29:47.334 --> 01:29:51.501
I hope you will give
us and I this right.

01:29:54.417 --> 01:29:57.709
The question is: "Is not
it too late, young lady?"

01:29:59.834 --> 01:30:00.876
I do not know.

01:30:04.042 --> 01:30:05.042
Next.

01:30:14.542 --> 01:30:16.084
In your own time, sir.

01:30:17.376 --> 01:30:19.167
Any mother would dream of a father,

01:30:19.376 --> 01:30:21.251
like Samuel for his child.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:25.584
He's a superman
and no one knows.

01:30:25.792 --> 01:30:26.917
Which he had to overcome.

01:30:27.126 --> 01:30:30.251
I assure you that he raises his
daughter in the best way possible.

01:30:30.459 --> 01:30:32.167
His way.

01:30:32.376 --> 01:30:33.376
Beacause this man.

01:30:33.584 --> 01:30:35.417
Has turned all his
life so that Gloria.

01:30:35.626 --> 01:30:37.834
Have the happiest life possible.

01:30:39.001 --> 01:30:40.334
<i>In fact,</i>

01:30:40.667 --> 01:30:43.334
I remember our meeting. We were.

01:30:44.167 --> 01:30:45.167
<i>In the tube,</i>

01:30:46.251 --> 01:30:49.542
Gloria was in great danger at
the foot of the escalator.

01:30:49.751 --> 01:30:51.167
Alone. And I saw this man.

01:30:51.376 --> 01:30:53.167
Risk her life to save her.

01:30:53.376 --> 01:30:54.792
At that very moment,

01:30:55.001 --> 01:30:58.334
I knew he was ment
to be a father.

01:31:00.126 --> 01:31:01.834
And stuntman.

01:31:04.042 --> 01:31:05.792
The question is:

01:31:06.001 --> 01:31:09.376
"Why did he leave his baby
unattended in the subway?"

01:31:12.626 --> 01:31:13.709
Hmm?

01:31:15.959 --> 01:31:16.959
I have met.

01:31:17.126 --> 01:31:18.876
Many parents of students.

01:31:19.084 --> 01:31:21.667
During my career in education.

01:31:21.876 --> 01:31:25.292
I must say that Mr. abelli
is, without a doubt,

01:31:25.501 --> 01:31:27.084
the most endearing father.

01:31:27.292 --> 01:31:28.834
I had the opportunity to meet.

01:31:29.542 --> 01:31:30.542
It transforms.

01:31:30.751 --> 01:31:32.626
Every minute of her daughter's life.

01:31:32.834 --> 01:31:34.167
In a magical moment.

01:31:34.376 --> 01:31:36.084
In my opinion,

01:31:36.917 --> 01:31:38.917
magic is cruelly
lacking in modern live.

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:40.209
Amen.

01:31:41.959 --> 01:31:43.417
The question is:

01:31:43.626 --> 01:31:47.584
"How many days did Gloria
go to school last month?"

01:31:54.501 --> 01:31:55.501
Five.

01:31:58.334 --> 01:31:59.376
Or six.

01:31:59.584 --> 01:32:01.251
Six, that's good.

01:32:01.459 --> 01:32:02.834
Six, definitely.

01:32:03.542 --> 01:32:05.084
Very well thank you.

01:32:06.227 --> 01:32:07.227
Next.

01:32:07.251 --> 01:32:08.792
Mr. Abelli.

01:32:18.876 --> 01:32:19.876
Sir.

01:32:24.334 --> 01:32:27.084
Gloria has arrived
in my life overnight.

01:32:30.126 --> 01:32:31.542
I was not ready.

01:32:32.459 --> 01:32:35.042
But I did the best I could.

01:32:36.126 --> 01:32:38.042
Maybe I have not quite high enough,

01:32:38.251 --> 01:32:41.334
maybe my love is too
strong, too loud.

01:32:42.167 --> 01:32:44.417
But I can not do otherwise.

01:32:44.626 --> 01:32:46.001
The question is...

01:32:46.209 --> 01:32:48.376
I'm not done.
No "the question is."

01:32:49.501 --> 01:32:51.667
Forgive me if I do not know the laws.

01:32:51.876 --> 01:32:53.876
I'm not a super father.

01:32:54.084 --> 01:32:56.251
But I'm fighting for
my daughter to live.

01:32:56.459 --> 01:32:59.251
In a world where all
children dream.

01:32:59.834 --> 01:33:01.751
I can change my job,

01:33:01.959 --> 01:33:05.209
I can make sure she does
not miss a school day.

01:33:05.417 --> 01:33:08.167
I can even learn
English, if you will,

01:33:09.459 --> 01:33:11.209
but I implore you,

01:33:12.959 --> 01:33:14.459
do not take my daughter away.

01:33:15.626 --> 01:33:17.459
Do not tear my heart away.

01:33:19.501 --> 01:33:21.001
Do not do that.

01:33:29.084 --> 01:33:30.417
That's all.

01:33:35.584 --> 01:33:37.542
The question is:

01:33:38.292 --> 01:33:41.334
"What is the child best interest?"

01:33:41.542 --> 01:33:43.751
That is the solely
question we are asking.

01:33:43.959 --> 01:33:46.042
The solely we have to answer.

01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:48.126
Before you today.

01:33:48.876 --> 01:33:50.376
Following the conscience,

01:33:50.584 --> 01:33:52.917
we unanimously decided.

01:33:53.917 --> 01:33:57.251
That the custody of
Gloria should return...

01:34:01.501 --> 01:34:03.084
To the parent she knows best.

01:34:05.376 --> 01:34:08.501
We give you custody of
your daughter, sir.

01:34:09.209 --> 01:34:10.501
- Yes!
- Thank you.

01:34:12.334 --> 01:34:13.334
Provided that...

01:34:14.126 --> 01:34:16.459
That you take English classes.

01:34:16.667 --> 01:34:17.709
Yes.

01:34:17.917 --> 01:34:20.584
"That you cease to be a stuntman."

01:34:20.792 --> 01:34:22.251
- We do not care.
- Yes.

01:34:22.459 --> 01:34:24.376
And that Gloria goes to school.

01:34:28.376 --> 01:34:30.584
The meeting adjourned.

01:34:30.792 --> 01:34:32.084
Thank you everyone.

01:34:36.167 --> 01:34:37.167
Mr. Abelli.

01:34:39.792 --> 01:34:41.376
Be worthy of this judgment.

01:34:41.584 --> 01:34:42.917
Ok. Ok.

01:34:43.126 --> 01:34:44.751
Hard, but fair.

01:34:59.917 --> 01:35:03.584
One year has 12
months, 365 days,

01:35:03.792 --> 01:35:05.417
and especially 4 seasons.

01:35:05.626 --> 01:35:06.792
Very distinct...

01:35:07.001 --> 01:35:08.459
Someone's knocking at the door.

01:35:09.667 --> 01:35:11.251
"Mademoiselle."

01:35:12.751 --> 01:35:14.667
Children, sit down.

01:35:15.667 --> 01:35:17.251
Some know it,

01:35:17.459 --> 01:35:21.501
but I present Samuel, your
new general superintendent.

01:35:21.709 --> 01:35:23.709
- Hello.
- Hello sir.

01:35:27.376 --> 01:35:28.876
Hello madam.

01:35:29.084 --> 01:35:31.251
The father of...
It's before all.

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.917
A new member of our institution.

01:35:34.126 --> 01:35:36.126
The staff must therefore accommodate it.

01:35:36.334 --> 01:35:38.084
"Do not worry, madam,
I'll make you forget."

01:35:38.292 --> 01:35:41.376
I do not think it's
a good idea to...

01:35:41.584 --> 01:35:43.251
Come and think in my office.

01:35:43.459 --> 01:35:46.042
I will explain to
you in private.

01:35:46.251 --> 01:35:48.251
Who will take care of my students?

01:35:48.459 --> 01:35:50.501
The new general supervisor.

01:35:53.251 --> 01:35:54.417
Are you okay, guys?

01:35:57.376 --> 01:35:58.709
You were on what?

01:35:59.251 --> 01:36:00.626
The four seasons.

01:36:00.834 --> 01:36:04.126
It's not complicated:
Winter, it's cold.

01:36:04.167 --> 01:36:05.917
Christmas trees, Christmas dad, snow...

01:36:06.126 --> 01:36:08.917
And there's summer too.
It's hot.

01:36:09.126 --> 01:36:12.167
The sun, the palm trees,
the orangeades...

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:15.334
They do not care.

01:36:15.959 --> 01:36:16.959
Good!

01:36:17.042 --> 01:36:18.667
What is the four seasons?

01:36:18.876 --> 01:36:19.876
It's Vivaldi.

01:36:19.959 --> 01:36:21.709
Vivaldi, great musician.

01:36:21.917 --> 01:36:24.917
Hair cut questionable, but
composer unavoidable.

01:36:25.126 --> 01:36:28.542
So we, it is normal, in
tribute to the good man,

01:36:28.751 --> 01:36:30.584
you, you keep this cup,

01:36:30.792 --> 01:36:32.167
it will make him happy,

01:36:32.376 --> 01:36:35.667
and we play music.
You have instruments?

01:36:39.792 --> 01:36:40.917
Yes yes yes!

01:36:41.126 --> 01:36:42.709
Congratulations! 20 out of 20 direct.

01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:43.917
Who wants 20 out of 20?

01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:45.584
'Me!

01:36:49.626 --> 01:36:51.792
It's the big brother!
I love this job!

01:36:55.501 --> 01:36:56.501
Hello?

01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:59.667
I can not talk to you,
I'm history.

01:36:59.876 --> 01:37:01.751
Samuel, we have a problem...

01:37:01.959 --> 01:37:03.626
What is happening?

01:37:03.834 --> 01:37:09.084
"Listen, miss Stuart asked
for a paternity test."

01:37:09.292 --> 01:37:10.292
What?

01:37:10.959 --> 01:37:12.459
I'm sorry.

01:37:53.417 --> 01:37:55.501
"I'm sorry, sir."

01:38:18.376 --> 01:38:19.626
I 'll be back.

01:38:35.667 --> 01:38:36.751
Kristin!

01:38:40.251 --> 01:38:41.709
- Come.
- It's okay.

01:38:47.001 --> 01:38:48.376
Just tell me.

01:38:49.876 --> 01:38:52.334
Did you know it from the beginning?
No.

01:38:55.459 --> 01:38:57.667
I was convinced it was you.

01:39:04.376 --> 01:39:05.834
I'm sorry.

01:39:28.334 --> 01:39:31.751
"What does mean" organic "?

01:39:33.834 --> 01:39:37.626
"That means the little
seed is not mine."

01:39:38.251 --> 01:39:40.917
- But you're still my daddy?
- Of course.

01:39:42.584 --> 01:39:45.167
You have a dad who designed you
and a dad who brought you up.

01:39:47.042 --> 01:39:49.667
- All that is just words.
- Exactly.

01:39:49.876 --> 01:39:52.001
It's just words, my daughter.

01:40:03.667 --> 01:40:05.417
Good morning. "Sir."

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:08.126
Is that obligatory, Scotland yard?

01:40:08.334 --> 01:40:10.584
I did not want to.
This is the procedure.

01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:15.209
You are ready?

01:40:18.584 --> 01:40:19.751
You leave me 2 m?

01:40:25.917 --> 01:40:28.317
Goodbye, that does not mean we'll
never see each other again.

01:40:29.376 --> 01:40:30.376
Hey?

01:40:30.584 --> 01:40:31.709
Yes I know.

01:40:33.792 --> 01:40:35.001
Dad...

01:40:35.959 --> 01:40:37.459
My love.

01:40:37.667 --> 01:40:39.417
Do not worry, it's okay.

01:40:40.626 --> 01:40:42.626
And then you'll love New York.

01:40:42.834 --> 01:40:46.126
You never took a plane!
It's going to be crazy. Hey?

01:40:46.334 --> 01:40:47.667
Sir?

01:40:47.876 --> 01:40:48.876
Come on.

01:40:49.584 --> 01:40:50.792
Let's go!

01:40:51.251 --> 01:40:54.334
Put that. We're expected, come on.

01:40:59.959 --> 01:41:01.834
You know what? We'll make a game.

01:41:02.042 --> 01:41:03.917
You're going to run down.

01:41:04.126 --> 01:41:06.334
If you're down before
I'm at the window,

01:41:06.542 --> 01:41:07.542
you won.

01:41:07.626 --> 01:41:09.334
- Ok?
- Ok.

01:41:10.417 --> 01:41:11.417
Ready?

01:41:12.751 --> 01:41:13.751
1...

01:41:15.042 --> 01:41:16.042
2...

01:41:16.834 --> 01:41:17.834
3!

01:41:25.376 --> 01:41:26.959
I'm sorry, Samuel.

01:41:29.209 --> 01:41:30.959
It could have happened otherwise.

01:41:31.792 --> 01:41:33.292
That should have been.

01:42:08.292 --> 01:42:09.834
I won.

01:42:38.126 --> 01:42:39.626
Hi, Bernie.

01:42:54.292 --> 01:42:55.834
We're going.

01:43:13.709 --> 01:43:16.459
"Is this the first time
you've been on a plane?"

01:43:16.667 --> 01:43:17.667
Yeah.

01:43:17.751 --> 01:43:20.417
- You'll see, it's a great journey.
- Hum.

01:43:20.626 --> 01:43:21.917
"Where up to miss?"

01:43:22.126 --> 01:43:24.417
Heathrow, terminal 3.

01:43:31.001 --> 01:43:32.167
Wait!

01:43:36.459 --> 01:43:38.251
What's the matter?

01:43:38.459 --> 01:43:41.167
I gotta go back, I
forgot something.

01:43:41.959 --> 01:43:42.959
You're sure?

01:43:43.167 --> 01:43:46.542
- Yeah, that's super important.
- Ok.

01:43:46.751 --> 01:43:47.917
Hurry up.

01:43:48.126 --> 01:43:49.126
Yeah.

01:44:03.251 --> 01:44:04.917
What are you doing here?

01:44:05.792 --> 01:44:08.459
I told mom I had
forgotten something.

01:44:09.042 --> 01:44:12.126
But in truth, I do
not want to leave.

01:44:14.376 --> 01:44:15.876
You lied to her?

01:44:16.792 --> 01:44:19.751
Ben... for the good of people,
we have the right, right?

01:44:23.251 --> 01:44:26.126
I want everyone to
live the whole life.

01:44:34.042 --> 01:44:35.751
We're gonna miss the plane.

01:44:42.417 --> 01:44:43.501
Sat! Open it!

01:44:43.709 --> 01:44:45.376
Open the door, please.

01:44:47.876 --> 01:44:49.042
Sam.

01:44:59.751 --> 01:45:02.292
"But where are we going?"
No idea!

01:45:10.792 --> 01:45:11.959
Over there!

01:45:14.376 --> 01:45:16.334
"Where are they, Bernie?"

01:45:18.126 --> 01:45:21.417
Fuck, Samuel...
If you know, tell him.

01:45:21.626 --> 01:45:23.126
- I dunno!
- The judge decided.

01:45:23.334 --> 01:45:24.501
It's an abduction!

01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:26.626
No. It's not an abduction!

01:45:27.209 --> 01:45:29.642
Are you going to report the
disappearance of their daughter?

01:45:32.142 --> 01:45:33.792
Tell me the truth.

01:45:35.709 --> 01:45:38.209
He makes a bullshit!
It's irresponsible!

01:45:38.417 --> 01:45:39.542
Stop saying that!

01:45:41.376 --> 01:45:43.084
This "irresponsible" guy,

01:45:43.292 --> 01:45:45.459
it's been four years since every day,

01:45:45.667 --> 01:45:49.459
he fears that this is the last time
he will see his daughter smile.

01:45:54.334 --> 01:45:56.084
That is the truth.

01:45:59.126 --> 01:46:01.126
What does it mean?

01:46:04.626 --> 01:46:06.292
She is sick.

01:46:08.876 --> 01:46:10.126
What?

01:46:12.417 --> 01:46:14.417
You know nothing.

01:46:32.626 --> 01:46:34.584
- Over there!
- There's nothing!

01:46:34.792 --> 01:46:38.167
"Yes, we're going to jump as on
the cliff when you were little!"

01:46:38.376 --> 01:46:39.834
"Truly, I've never jumped!"

01:46:40.042 --> 01:46:42.917
Not serious! You're immortal!
Trust me.

01:46:43.126 --> 01:46:44.251
Hold on! No!

01:47:09.292 --> 01:47:12.584
Did you know this thing?
"Of course!"

01:47:20.334 --> 01:47:22.667
I know where I'm going to take you.

01:48:02.542 --> 01:48:03.584
Here.

01:48:04.667 --> 01:48:06.667
It was here that I did not jump.

01:48:08.584 --> 01:48:09.626
Okay.

01:48:12.292 --> 01:48:13.584
We can skip today.

01:48:14.292 --> 01:48:16.959
No. We're going to start from scratch.
If you start.

01:48:17.167 --> 01:48:20.084
To say stuff like that!
Lets' go.

01:48:26.709 --> 01:48:30.917
There are more difficult tests than
jumping from the top of a cliff.

01:48:35.084 --> 01:48:36.709
When Gloria entered my life,

01:48:36.917 --> 01:48:39.959
I found the courage to throw
myself into the void.

01:48:51.501 --> 01:48:54.501
She taught me that fear
of dying is nothing.

01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:56.251
Alongside that are not living.

01:49:00.001 --> 01:49:03.459
That a 20 euro ticket to pay
for a taxi could be the key.

01:49:03.667 --> 01:49:05.917
Of absolute happiness.

01:49:06.126 --> 01:49:14.126
A.

01:49:30.584 --> 01:49:33.292
There is no perfect
mother or ideal father.

01:49:33.501 --> 01:49:34.917
One does what one can.

01:49:35.709 --> 01:49:36.709
We improvise.

01:49:41.001 --> 01:49:43.417
Today, I just need
to look at Gloria,

01:49:43.626 --> 01:49:46.042
to hear her laugh,
to forget all the rest.

01:49:49.792 --> 01:49:51.792
Only count that moment.

01:49:52.834 --> 01:49:55.334
And that little music
that will never leave me.

01:50:00.751 --> 01:50:02.209
It was worth it.

01:50:08.209 --> 01:50:11.334
Even when life reserves
you a setback,

01:50:11.542 --> 01:50:13.417
a defect in the machine,

01:50:14.667 --> 01:50:16.001
a weakness,

01:50:17.126 --> 01:50:18.292
just here,

01:50:18.501 --> 01:50:21.417
close to the heart,
and that the doctors explain to us.

01:50:21.626 --> 01:50:24.084
That there is no explanation.

01:50:24.292 --> 01:50:25.292
It's like that.

01:50:25.501 --> 01:50:26.751
It's life.

01:50:28.959 --> 01:50:32.959
That one day,
Gloria will fall asleep and never wake up.

01:50:37.334 --> 01:50:40.042
The doctors had not been mistaken.

01:50:40.251 --> 01:50:43.584
Gloria left a few weeks after she passed,

01:50:43.792 --> 01:50:46.376
the most beautiful moments
of her family life.

01:51:05.334 --> 01:51:08.001
My father prepared me
to face my fears,

01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:10.126
and my daughter, to face life.

01:51:12.834 --> 01:51:16.209
There are sometimes
falls that never stop,

01:51:16.417 --> 01:51:20.584
but I wanted every second of this fall
to be a feast.

01:51:20.792 --> 01:51:25.209
And today I have engraved in each
of these seconds with my daughter.

01:51:27.667 --> 01:51:30.542
Gloria is there, near me.

01:51:30.751 --> 01:51:33.417
Every moment. Forever.

01:51:36.251 --> 01:51:37.584
And tomorrow

01:51:38.305 --> 01:51:44.535
