10:23.957 --> 10:26.334
These are my airmen. They're good boys.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.837
Drop your clits and lift your tits!

10:28.920 --> 10:29.921
Officer on deck!

10:30.004 --> 10:31.172
Sir, yes, sir!

10:31.256 --> 10:32.340
At ease, ladies.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.883
Ha-ha. Ladies.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.262
Men, this is my good friend,
Major Frank Murphy,

10:37.345 --> 10:38.638
the Demon of Da Nang.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.889
He's killed more Viet Cong

10:39.973 --> 10:42.976
than that little river fish
that swims up your dick hole.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.435
Now load this lumber in his car.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.105
-Sir?
-You heard me!

10:47.188 --> 10:50.859
You can go back to braiding the hair
on each other's asses when you're done.

10:50.942 --> 10:51.776
Hop to it!

10:54.320 --> 10:56.114
You got to keep them down.
It's good for morale.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.074
So, uh, this is all right?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.576
Isn't that wood
property of the government?

10:59.659 --> 11:02.245
Well, they pay 2,200 dollars
for a fucking toilet seat.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.371
It'll be fine.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.623
Hey, I'll tell you what.
This is gonna take awhile.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.375
Let me buy you a drink...

11:07.709 --> 11:11.212
while these two rump rangers
take a handful of Crisco,

11:11.296 --> 11:14.549
grease each other up,
and hop on the fuck pile!

11:14.632 --> 11:16.259
[chuckles] God, I miss the service.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.432
So, would you rather be
a bird or an amphibian?

11:22.515 --> 11:23.808
-Bird.
-Wrong.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.311
Goomer, Babe, and Holty.

11:26.394 --> 11:28.313
Now that's what I call a power trio.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.899
Hey, Vic. You want to help out Frank?

11:30.982 --> 11:32.233
Take a seat.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.736
Frank drove away with Colonel Chet.

11:34.819 --> 11:36.362
And he looks really sharp.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.033
If you two ever got on a tandem bicycle,
ho-ho, watch out!

11:40.116 --> 11:41.492
Tandem.

11:41.576 --> 11:43.536
That reminds me of the time I was in L.A.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.788
and I hung out with Sonny and Cher
on their yacht.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.125
You know when you think
the first boat is the boat,

11:49.209 --> 11:51.544
but it's just the boat
taking you to the boat?

11:51.628 --> 11:53.630
[Babe and Goomer laugh]

11:53.713 --> 11:54.547
[both] No.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.008
Speaking of Cher,

11:57.091 --> 12:00.929
I once had to share a stale cracker
with two other men.

12:01.012 --> 12:03.264
We salted it with our tears.

12:07.644 --> 12:08.561
[grunts]

12:08.645 --> 12:09.938
Fuck you, Dad!

12:10.897 --> 12:11.898
Dildo!

12:12.523 --> 12:14.859
[laughing] Oh, man!

12:14.943 --> 12:17.904
Looks like somebody got
butt-fingered as a kid.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.614
I didn't get fingered. I drowned!

12:20.031 --> 12:21.199
Oh, hey, guys.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.700
Mad at your house, huh?

12:22.784 --> 12:23.618
[grunts]

12:23.701 --> 12:24.911
I hate this wall.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.246
[grunts]

12:26.329 --> 12:27.872
Happy birthday to me.

12:28.623 --> 12:31.876
You can't work on your birthday.
That's like a state law or something.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.127
Tell that to my dad.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.338
Your dad left about an hour ago, Kevin.

12:35.421 --> 12:39.384
He did? Oh, man, he makes me work
and he just leaves?

12:40.218 --> 12:41.302
I'm out of here.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.346
Let's go celebrate your birthday, Kev.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.265
Have fun, Kevin.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.434
I'm gonna go cool my armpits
in your refrigerator.

12:50.353 --> 12:54.274
Well, we're hoping to go to Cape May
the last week of August.

12:54.357 --> 12:57.568
That's a-when all the eggplants
come down from Philly!

12:57.652 --> 12:59.779
Now, that's not nice, Nana Rose.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.572
Am I wrong?

13:01.656 --> 13:04.450
Nana Rose, maybe you want to go
to the TV room.

13:04.534 --> 13:06.786
Ooh,<i> Dialing For Dollars</i> is on.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.914
Aw, it's the one show
the heebs haven't ruined.

13:12.458 --> 13:13.710
[gasps]

13:17.130 --> 13:20.049
Wow, I always thought
officers were pricks.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.135
Now I can see why. This place is great!

13:22.218 --> 13:24.220
[both laugh]

13:26.139 --> 13:27.890
I don't deserve to be here.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.350
I'm not a pilot.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.395
Never been in a cockpit,
except to clean out the ashtray.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.272
Oh, you're selling yourself short, pal.

13:34.814 --> 13:35.857
You run a major airline.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.942
I don't run it. But I know the owner.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.611
She took my son to the bathroom once.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.822
Oh, life is good, Frank. Cheers.

13:44.407 --> 13:47.285
You know, I've been all over the world,
but I love this burg.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.371
I could see me and Nguyen-Nguyen
settling down here.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.581
You got a good woman, Chet.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.874
And don't I know it.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.083
She's crazy about me.

13:54.167 --> 13:58.171
All night long she calls out my name in
her sleep.<i> "Chet,</i> Chet.<i> Chet,</i> Chet."

13:58.254 --> 13:59.255
I love Sue.

14:00.131 --> 14:03.551
I don't know how I ever got
a girl like that to marry me. [chuckles]

14:04.302 --> 14:05.386
Oh, right. Fucking Kevin.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.846
Hey, Sandy baby.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.473
What's your pleasure, Colonel?

14:08.556 --> 14:11.017
Well, I'd love for you and I to go test
the felt on that pool table,

14:11.100 --> 14:12.977
but... I'll settle for another drink.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.229
-Ooh. [laughs]
-[laughs]

14:15.313 --> 14:18.941
-Whoo.
-Oh, Chet, you're trouble.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.904
And you blush way too easy. [chuckles]

14:22.987 --> 14:26.240
[chuckles] Oh, no I don't. Do I?

14:26.324 --> 14:29.410
[speaking accented French]

14:29.494 --> 14:32.955
That means "deer through windshield."

14:33.539 --> 14:34.832
Your turn.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.086
[speaking accented French]

14:38.169 --> 14:39.504
Leaving the scene.

14:39.587 --> 14:42.340
Something you are familiar with.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.800
Phillip, is something wrong?

14:43.883 --> 14:45.885
-What happened to your eyebrows?
-Nothing!

14:45.968 --> 14:47.553
[grunting]

14:47.637 --> 14:49.222
Phillip, what's your problem?

14:49.847 --> 14:52.767
-You're not my friend anymore!
-Phillip?

14:52.850 --> 14:53.810
I am your friend!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.646
Tell that to Bridget Fitzsimmons!

14:56.729 --> 14:58.940
-What?
-You're a poop head!

14:59.023 --> 15:01.609
Phillip, I have a ladybug
and I'm gonna go...

15:01.692 --> 15:02.985
I am-- You know what?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.821
Why can't I be both your friends?

15:04.904 --> 15:06.823
Because you're my only friend!

15:06.906 --> 15:08.783
My only friend is you!

15:08.866 --> 15:10.284
I am-- You know what?

15:10.368 --> 15:11.494
You know what?

15:12.078 --> 15:13.079
You know what?

15:13.162 --> 15:14.789
[angrily] You know what, Anthony?

15:14.872 --> 15:16.958
You annoy the fuck out of me!

15:17.041 --> 15:21.712
I wish I'd pushed harder on your soft spot
when you were a baby!

15:22.713 --> 15:24.507
-[grunts]
-Ow!

15:24.590 --> 15:26.008
-Mommy.
-[Phillip hyperventilating]

15:26.092 --> 15:28.177
You know what? [cries]

15:28.261 --> 15:29.804
My baby!

15:30.388 --> 15:33.433
Phillip Pope John the 23rd Bonfiglio!

15:33.516 --> 15:35.518
How could you do that to your brother?

15:36.102 --> 15:37.937
You are going to mommy jail!

15:38.396 --> 15:40.898
I did it. I pushed Anthony down.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.233
Of course!

15:42.316 --> 15:45.736
I knew you were a bad seed
when you lit the woods on fire!

15:45.820 --> 15:47.947
No, Mother, it was me.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.617
There's no reason to try
and cover for this pyromaniac.

15:51.701 --> 15:55.788
Everyone knows redheads get
their hair color from the hand of Satan.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.374
Are you gonna let my son lie for you?

15:58.458 --> 16:01.419
My son is not a liar. You're the liar!

16:01.502 --> 16:02.837
What did you call me?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.630
You said you loved my invention,

16:04.714 --> 16:07.008
and then you just threw it in the trash!

16:07.091 --> 16:10.678
[Marie] How dare you invade
the sanctity of my garbage pail!

16:10.761 --> 16:13.347
I put my heart and soul
into the Forkoontula,

16:13.431 --> 16:15.600
and she just tossed it in
with the coffee grounds!

16:15.683 --> 16:17.894
I threw my Forkoontula out too.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.021
You did what?

16:20.104 --> 16:21.898
It cut me, Sue.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.233
It cut me like I owed it money.

16:24.317 --> 16:25.485
[gasps]

16:27.361 --> 16:31.532
I looked at that American soldier,
the one who liberated me,

16:31.782 --> 16:33.367
and I asked him his name.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.497
It was the German word for freedom.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.832
[speaks German]

16:39.916 --> 16:43.002
Lieutenant Hitler...

16:44.295 --> 16:46.339
Oh, man.

16:46.631 --> 16:48.508
You know, I recently got clean and...

16:49.050 --> 16:52.637
I guess up till now I never really paid
attention to everything you went through.

16:53.429 --> 16:55.848
But now that I'm sober,
and I really hear you,

16:55.932 --> 16:56.849
I got to say...

16:57.558 --> 16:59.435
you're a fucking bummer, man.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.436
A what?

17:00.520 --> 17:03.189
Okay, some horrible shit
happened to you, amigo,

17:03.272 --> 17:04.857
and you have the right to sing the blues,

17:04.941 --> 17:07.527
but you got to mix in
some rock 'n' roll along the way.

17:07.610 --> 17:10.821
Like last night, I hung out with
these three Apaches at my A.A. meeting

17:10.905 --> 17:13.616
and they don't dwell on
their past every five minutes.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.203
Shit, somebody built a fucking drive-in
movie on their grandfather's grave,

17:17.286 --> 17:19.997
but they just say,
"What's playing, Little Big Man?"

17:20.081 --> 17:21.499
Oh, my goodness.

17:21.582 --> 17:25.127
Is this how you've all seen me
all these years?

17:25.211 --> 17:27.338
As just a killjoy?

17:27.421 --> 17:30.675
No, no, no, we think you're
a barrel of laughs, Mr. Holocauster!

17:30.758 --> 17:33.135
[speaks German] It's true!

17:33.678 --> 17:35.012
Look at that beautiful wood.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.556
You are a hell of a friend.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.224
We should really be getting back.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.934
Oh, we're not done here yet.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.604
Oh, my God.

17:44.188 --> 17:46.941
That's my plane. Want to take a spin?

17:47.858 --> 17:50.319
If I didn't go to hell for loving a man,
I'd kiss you.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.281
[jet engines roaring]

17:53.364 --> 17:54.407
Having fun, Frank?

17:54.490 --> 17:57.743
Jesus Christ, this is my dream come true.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.245
You ready to go fast?

17:59.537 --> 18:00.705
We're going slow?

18:01.038 --> 18:02.206
You tell me.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.001
Holy shit!

18:07.044 --> 18:08.546
[Nikki] Make a birthday wish!

18:09.297 --> 18:10.798
-[all laugh]
-All right, yeah!

18:10.881 --> 18:12.842
Quiet! We're in full view of everybody.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.803
It's okay. We're burning the evidence.

18:15.886 --> 18:17.096
[all laugh]

18:17.179 --> 18:18.639
[spray can rattling]

18:18.723 --> 18:20.558
Let's decorate for your party.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.310
You do that in broad daylight?

18:22.393 --> 18:25.104
Well, we've got to be able to see
what we're doing.

18:25.187 --> 18:26.480
What if somebody sees us?

18:26.564 --> 18:28.774
Uh, we fucking run.

18:28.858 --> 18:29.942
[laughs]

18:30.026 --> 18:32.236
I like this kid. He makes me feel smart.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.030
That's so cool.

18:34.572 --> 18:38.868
It really makes you think about what would
happen if a giant bullet hit the Earth.

18:38.951 --> 18:39.952
Your turn.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.288
Uh... I don't know.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.957
I mean, this guy stiffed me
on my Christmas tree money,

18:45.041 --> 18:47.793
but, it's like-- It's his property and...

18:47.877 --> 18:50.004
This is Kevin. He's a good boy

18:50.087 --> 18:52.882
who met some new friends
from the wrong side of the tracks.

18:52.965 --> 18:57.637
How will these delinquents influence
his goody-two-shoe upbringing?

18:57.720 --> 18:59.013
Peer pressure!

18:59.096 --> 19:00.431
Peer pressure!

19:00.514 --> 19:01.849
Peer pressure!

19:01.932 --> 19:03.309
Peer pressure!

19:03.392 --> 19:04.727
Peer pressure!

19:04.810 --> 19:05.936
Peer pressure!

19:06.020 --> 19:06.937
Fuck it.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.565
[rock music playing]

19:10.066 --> 19:11.317
Oh my God, this is so--

19:11.400 --> 19:12.276
Hey!

19:12.360 --> 19:15.780
What in the wide world of fuck
do you think you're doing?

19:15.863 --> 19:17.114
Uh...

19:17.198 --> 19:18.282
It's my birthday?

19:18.366 --> 19:19.283
Run! [laughs]

19:21.160 --> 19:22.620
[Kevin] Your son is an asshole!

19:22.703 --> 19:24.664
You can blame his mother for that!

19:25.247 --> 19:26.957
[Frank] Chet, this is the best day ever.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.335
It's like a dream come true.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.337
This thing is a dream machine.

19:31.420 --> 19:32.630
You got that right.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.507
And plenty of mine have come true
right here.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.801
Why do you think they call it the cockpit?

19:36.884 --> 19:39.053
[both laugh]

19:39.136 --> 19:41.097
Sounds like you've had
some good times up here.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.723
You know, Sandy has a roommate.

19:43.224 --> 19:45.101
Not great looking, but a hell of a moaner.

We could all be having
a good time real soon.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.438
[both chuckle]

19:51.440 --> 19:52.525
You're kidding, right?

19:53.401 --> 19:54.694
I would never do that to Sue.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.987
Sure. Kidding.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.323
Oh, okay. Good. Good.
Because, you know, I just-- Just saying--

19:59.407 --> 20:00.366
Nope, it's fine.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.413
So, I guess I'm a bad guy, huh?

20:05.496 --> 20:07.581
No! You're not a bad guy.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.668
-I'm just saying that I--
-That you are superior to me.

20:10.751 --> 20:12.461
No! I didn't say that.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.047
It's okay. It's okay--
Hey, hey, hey! It's okay!

20:15.131 --> 20:17.508
You're the saint, right?
And I'm the piece of shit.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.510
No! I never said that. Not at all.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.179
You're a hero. I think you're great.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.806
Okay. Thanks, Frank.

20:26.684 --> 20:30.354
Say, pal, how about I show you
what this baby can really do?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.607
[Frank] Whoa!

20:33.691 --> 20:35.985
My balls are in my shoes!

20:36.694 --> 20:39.447
Marie, I'm so sorry I yelled at you.

20:39.780 --> 20:40.906
I don't know what got into me.

20:40.990 --> 20:44.118
It's okay. I've been pregnant
in the summertime.

20:44.827 --> 20:47.997
Oh, you pregnant now? Triplets?

20:48.080 --> 20:52.543

Because, baby, she's fat!

20:52.626 --> 20:53.794

20:53.878 --> 20:56.255
If you hate the Forkoontula so much,

20:56.338 --> 20:59.008
why did you say you liked it
at my house the other day?

20:59.091 --> 21:01.010
You forced it on me, Sue.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.887
I was afraid to say no to you.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.388
Did you all feel like that?

21:04.472 --> 21:07.266
Your eyes were scary and so round.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.102
But it's okay. Terror work some time.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.522
Terror? Well of course you'd hate it.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.065
Plus it's dangerous.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.902
You know that punching bag thing
in the back of your throat?

21:18.277 --> 21:20.070

21:21.864 --> 21:23.199

21:23.282 --> 21:26.035
I would never sell something
that could hurt you.

21:26.118 --> 21:28.370
Thank you for your honesty.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.872
I know it took awhile,

21:29.955 --> 21:32.958
but I finally heard
the hard truth about my invention.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.379
You really love it,
but it has a few minor flaws.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.006
Well, that's not exactly what--

21:39.089 --> 21:40.758
I've got more work to do on this thing.

21:40.841 --> 21:42.676
You know, the first Salad Tosser

21:42.760 --> 21:44.929
was just a rusty washing machine
and a bicycle chain.

21:45.012 --> 21:48.098
Oh! How many people did that one kill?

21:50.601 --> 21:53.729
[Frank] Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.689
[Chet]
Yeah, this isn't for everyone, big dog.

21:55.773 --> 21:56.982
Let's get you back on the ground.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.401

22:00.486 --> 22:01.445
What's going on?

22:01.529 --> 22:04.156
Frank, I don't know.
I got a light on here. We're losing power.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.407
Losing power?

22:08.077 --> 22:11.872
Oh, shit!

-Shit! Shit! Shit!

22:15.417 --> 22:18.170
What the fuck?
Shit! Chet! What the fuck?

22:18.254 --> 22:20.798
We've got nothing, Frank.
I'm trying to restart the engine.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.342
Fucking restart it! Oh, Christ! Christ!

22:23.425 --> 22:26.011
-[Frank] Restart the fucking thing!
-Brace for impact, Frank.

22:47.575 --> 22:51.620

this whole time. [chuckles]

You're roasting my dad's balls in here.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.361
Maureen, get out!

24:06.946 --> 24:08.030
Look, Phillip.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.616
Bridget's just a girl who's my friend.

24:11.116 --> 24:12.660
But you're my best friend.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.578
So I'm your best boy friend?

I guess.

in front of Jimmy Fitzsimmons...
