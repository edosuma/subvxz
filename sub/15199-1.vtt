00:34.268 --> 00:36.068
Where's the damn negotiator?

00:36.137 --> 00:37.870
-They said 10 minutes.
-10 minutes?

00:37.938 --> 00:40.906
They're all gonna be
dead in 10 minutes.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.875
Sir, I think we got company.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.119
What the hell
is he doing here?

00:54.188 --> 00:57.056
I don't know. Son of a bitch
thinks he's a hero now.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.770
Well, he's gonna
get us all ki...

01:14.909 --> 01:16.942
Look out, Jack!

01:17.011 --> 01:19.244
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

01:21.182 --> 01:22.448
Get down!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.918
No, Jack! No!

01:42.503 --> 01:43.502
No!

01:43.571 --> 01:45.104
Jack!

01:45.172 --> 01:46.605
Jack!

01:46.674 --> 01:48.173
Don't leave me, Jack!

01:48.242 --> 01:50.709
Don't leave me! Jack!

01:50.778 --> 01:51.710
No!

01:51.779 --> 01:53.545
No!

01:53.614 --> 01:59.051
No!

01:59.120 --> 02:01.987
No!

02:02.056 --> 02:04.623
Cut! Cut! No!

02:04.692 --> 02:06.358
That's a cut!
Cut! Cut! Cut!

02:06.427 --> 02:07.526
Are those the lines?

02:07.595 --> 02:09.862
Is that the script?
Give...

02:09.930 --> 02:11.530
Colton!

02:11.599 --> 02:12.631
Hey, man, are you okay?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.233
I think I hurt my back.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.135
You were so good, man.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.170
I know why I quit acting now.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.072
Yeah. Everything looked
just fine to me.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.740
You looked fine to me.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.809
Let me rub that back for you.

02:23.878 --> 02:25.177
-Good job, Marty.
-Come on.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.179
Come on. Come on. Let
me rub that for you.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.180
What happened to the scene?

02:28.249 --> 02:29.314
What happened to the comedy?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.083
Well, I changed
a few things, kid.

02:31.152 --> 02:32.584
You changed some things?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.419
You can't do that. Were
you gonna tell anyone?

02:34.488 --> 02:36.522
Well, you know, I...
Wasn't working for me.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.657
It might be
a little too funny.

02:38.726 --> 02:40.225
Yeah, it was too funny.
Yeah.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.894
Too funny? It's
supposed to be funny.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.496
It's a comedy.
It's called "Clown Cops."

02:44.565 --> 02:45.564
Yeah, well, my friend...

02:45.633 --> 02:47.432
You came out of
a pizza cop car.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.401
My friend just got shot, Joshie.

02:49.470 --> 02:51.170
It's a flesh wound.
He lives.

02:51.238 --> 02:52.771
Yeah. I mean,
you seen the scene.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.773
Have you read the scene?
Have you read the script?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.208
Yeah, I have,
but my character hasn't.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.843
You know, in my opinion,

02:57.912 --> 03:00.012
it should be
more serious, I think.

03:00.080 --> 03:02.181
You think? No, you're
not paid to think.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.416
You're paid to act,
I'm paid to direct,

03:04.485 --> 03:06.118
and it's
not going well.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.719
I'm gonna have
to tell the studio.

03:07.788 --> 03:09.855
I don't want to have
to tell the studio.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.623
No.
Joshie, no, no, no.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.026
You know what it is?
I'm... I'm crashing.

03:14.094 --> 03:15.227
That's the problem.
I'm crashing.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.562
-Are you okay?
-Low blood sugar!

03:16.630 --> 03:17.696
Chair!

03:17.765 --> 03:20.532
Chair! Chair! Chair!

03:20.601 --> 03:22.568
I'm telling you, I'm no good...
Where's Kyle?

03:22.636 --> 03:24.636
Maybe I need a salad
or something. Kyle!

03:24.705 --> 03:26.038
-Kyle!
-Yes, Mr. West.

03:26.106 --> 03:27.639
Kyle! Lips! Lips!
Quickly! Quickly!

03:29.877 --> 03:32.544
Well, okay.
Kyle, where's that salad,

03:32.613 --> 03:34.213
the kale salad from Lou's?

03:34.281 --> 03:35.647
There was a problem,
Mr. West.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.915
A problem?

03:36.984 --> 03:38.550
Your credit card
maybe was declined.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.919
-Who knows? I don't...
-What?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.588
This is very lovely.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.090
Just go get some food.

03:45.159 --> 03:47.125
Get your blood sugar into
just a nice comfy place...

03:47.194 --> 03:48.460
-I need something.
-Thank you.

03:48.529 --> 03:50.162
-And then you come back here...
-Thank you.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.130
And then read the freaking
scene as scripted!

03:52.199 --> 03:53.165
I promise. I pro...

03:53.234 --> 03:54.166
This is nice.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.801
This is
a nice sport coat.

03:55.869 --> 03:56.835
Barney's?
Where's this from?

03:56.904 --> 03:58.103
It's from my grandfather.

03:58.172 --> 03:59.338
It's beautiful,
really beautiful,

03:59.406 --> 04:01.006
-lovely.
-I'm sorry I snapped.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.441
It's okay.
It happens.

04:02.509 --> 04:04.276
-Just read the scene.
-It's moviemaking. Okay.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.644
All right, people,
we're resetting!

04:05.713 --> 04:06.912
Back to one!

04:06.981 --> 04:08.847
I'll be better!
I'll be better.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.749
I swear I'll be better.
What happened?

04:10.818 --> 04:13.185
What happened with the credit
card? How'd it get declined?

04:13.254 --> 04:16.454
Well, there were several
suspicious charges...

04:16.523 --> 04:17.990
What?
In Fort Lauderdale.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.524
Fort Lauderdale? Who's
in Fort Lauderdale? I...

04:20.594 --> 04:23.695
Gee. Look, just call
the credit card company.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.696
Approve the charges.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.765
Get my kale salad,
and do s...

04:26.834 --> 04:29.434
You're so muscular.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.702
-Yeah.
-Looks nice.

04:30.771 --> 04:31.703
You're working out.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.038
-Sort of.
-Good. Okay.

04:33.107 --> 04:34.172
Yeah.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.141
I'm not.

04:55.596 --> 04:57.296
<i>Fort Lauderdale?</i>

04:57.364 --> 04:58.830
Fort Lauderdale?

04:58.899 --> 05:00.198
Who said I was
in Fort Lauderdale?

05:00.267 --> 05:01.900
Your best friends,
Amex and Visa.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.535
Hey, will you pass me
that mango colada?

05:03.604 --> 05:05.003
Hey!

05:05.072 --> 05:07.205
<i>That's not code name
for a science book?</i>

05:07.274 --> 05:08.206
Mango colada?

05:08.275 --> 05:09.641
No, it's a beverage.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.678
Well, that's alcohol,
and it's Friday.

05:12.746 --> 05:14.913
I'm 21, and I'm parched.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.248
Besides, we didn't
have class today,

05:16.317 --> 05:17.649
so we have
a three-day weekend.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.184
Some of us
went to the beach,

05:19.253 --> 05:20.485
so stop freakin' out.

05:20.554 --> 05:22.421
I'm not freakin' out,
okay? Look,

05:22.489 --> 05:25.057
I'm supposed to be looking after
you while your mother's gone.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.492
<i>How am I supposed to do
that when I can't find you?</i>

05:27.561 --> 05:29.861
I'm not 10. I don't have
to tell you everything.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.163
<i>Well, you know what?</i>

05:31.231 --> 05:33.899
You do, as long
as I'm paying for it.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.267
<i>I'm fine,</i>

05:35.336 --> 05:37.502
and I don't need
my stepdad babysitting me.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.671
You're not checking up
on Mom every day

05:39.740 --> 05:42.441
while she's halfway across the world
on some yoga retreat, are you?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.675
<i>Hey, you know what, Raya?</i>

05:43.744 --> 05:45.010
You're not your mother, okay?

05:45.079 --> 05:47.179
And she had a very
tough year last year.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.180
You know that.

05:48.248 --> 05:49.581
My mom's gonna be fine.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.951
And, no, you're right.
I wasn't there.

05:53.020 --> 05:57.255
I was stuck in a library for 72
hours studying for finals week,

05:57.324 --> 06:01.126
being responsible, which is why
you can trust me now, Colt.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.427
I do trust you, Raya,

06:02.496 --> 06:04.429
and I know you could
take care of yourself.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.465
I know
you're responsible.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.633
And, Raya...

06:08.702 --> 06:10.969
you can call me Dad.

06:13.140 --> 06:14.406
My God.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.407
My God.

06:18.946 --> 06:19.878
My God.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.079
Raya?

06:27.521 --> 06:29.821
What just happened?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.323
Nothing good.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.836
They're here.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.614
Lavalantula!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.116
Run!

07:18.372 --> 07:19.371
Watch out!

07:27.714 --> 07:29.714
God! Raya!

07:29.783 --> 07:30.849
Casey!

07:30.918 --> 07:32.951
-Casey!
-Raya!

07:33.020 --> 07:35.020
Help me!

07:35.088 --> 07:36.021
No!

07:38.025 --> 07:40.725
Casey!
Casey!

07:43.764 --> 07:45.964
We have to go!

07:56.410 --> 07:58.844
<i>Hey, this is Raya.
Leave me a message.</i>

07:58.912 --> 08:00.078
<i>Bye.</i>

08:00.147 --> 08:02.714
Raya, call me back.
It's your dad.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.382
This is Lisa Johnson,

08:04.451 --> 08:07.152
and I am here in the downtown
district of Fort Lauderdale

08:07.221 --> 08:10.021
after massive sinkholes
all over the city

08:10.090 --> 08:12.257
have birthed another wave
of lavalantulas.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.559
And almost a year ago
to the day

08:14.628 --> 08:16.828
where they first
wreaked havoc on Los Angeles.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.531
The big question on
everyone's mind right now

08:19.600 --> 08:21.433
is when will the military
take action?

08:21.502 --> 08:26.605
Or does Florida
need Colton West?

08:26.673 --> 08:29.841
This is Lisa Johnson signing off
from downtown Fort Lauderdale.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.510
I'm not
doing this again.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.852
Hey, did you feel that?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.419
No.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.923
Hey, man, this is
not California.

08:44.992 --> 08:47.292
Things do not shake
like this in Florida.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.628
Not outside of South
Beach, anyway.

08:49.696 --> 08:50.629
Are you all right?

08:50.697 --> 08:52.297
Army helicopters, shaking!

08:52.366 --> 08:54.232
I'm having a bad déjà vu.

08:54.301 --> 08:56.034
No, you're not.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.736
Were you on the phone
with somebody?

08:57.804 --> 08:59.304
Yeah, my daughter, Raya.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.540
-Where's she at?
-Fort Lauderdale.

09:01.608 --> 09:05.977
Man, I heard that's where the
epicenter of all this mess is.

09:06.046 --> 09:09.381
Come on, Colton.
What would Red Rocket do, man?

09:19.960 --> 09:22.127
Where are those guns
you were working on?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.565
You okay?

09:26.633 --> 09:32.304
This is a modified XM25 Counter
Defilade Target Engagement System,

09:32.372 --> 09:35.974
specially designed to shoot
armor-piercing 50-millimeter rounds

09:36.043 --> 09:38.643
and my favorite,
liquid-nitrogen bombés.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.846
The Army likes
to call this...

09:44.718 --> 09:45.984
the Punisher.

09:46.053 --> 09:48.286
And Swiss Army knife
in the clip.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.621
But with
our modifications,

09:49.690 --> 09:52.257
I call her
a cold day in Hell.

09:52.326 --> 09:54.526
Have you tested it?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.528
Nope, but she's
pretty as hell.

09:56.597 --> 09:59.164
Mr. West, they're calling
everyone back to set.

09:59.232 --> 10:01.099
Go ahead.

10:01.168 --> 10:03.034
We're not going
back to set, Kyle.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.970
Excuse me? When you
signed up for this,

10:05.038 --> 10:06.438
you knew what it
was gonna entail,

10:06.506 --> 10:08.006
didn't you?
Yes, Mr. West.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.175
And you said it was okay
with you, didn't you?

10:10.243 --> 10:12.510
Yes, Mr. West.
So I gotta know, punk,

10:12.579 --> 10:15.347
are you in,
or are you out?

10:15.415 --> 10:17.549
If it means I can stop
getting your salads

10:17.618 --> 10:20.518
and start shooting spiders, Mr.
West, then I am all in.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.854
Wait.
Who's shooting spiders?

10:22.923 --> 10:25.156
No, the only thing we're
doing is shooting a scene,

10:25.225 --> 10:27.158
a very large,
expensive scene

10:27.227 --> 10:29.394
that's going tens of thousands of
dollars over budget every minute.

10:29.463 --> 10:30.996
Calm down, Joshie.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.631
Here's the deal.

10:32.699 --> 10:34.199
I'm gonna go
take a whiz,

10:34.267 --> 10:37.035
and then you and I,
Mr. Director,

10:37.104 --> 10:39.304
we're gonna make
movie magic.

10:39.373 --> 10:42.574
Okay. Sounds good.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.511
I have a good
feeling about this.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.079
Let's do it!

10:48.148 --> 10:50.148
Get my bag.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.349
Okay.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.653
I can't.
I can't. I can't.

10:54.721 --> 10:57.522
No, no, no. Not again.
Not again.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.057
Not again.
Well...

11:00.160 --> 11:01.926
you have to.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.328
Just one more time.

11:03.397 --> 11:06.164
You all better be be safe.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.733
Safe is our middle name.

11:10.303 --> 11:13.171
Okay, everyone,
we're back in two minutes.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.907
Get the helicopter
back up in the air.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.742
We can't do that.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.577
Why the hell not?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.279
Colton just,
hijacked it.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.415
No!

11:23.483 --> 11:26.584
Colton!

11:36.163 --> 11:38.530
You know I'm gonna get
fired for this, Mr. West.

11:38.598 --> 11:40.465
You know you're gonna
get a Purple Heart

11:40.534 --> 11:42.100
for this, Lester.
Anything?

11:42.169 --> 11:44.703
No. The circuits
are probably overloaded.

11:44.771 --> 11:46.204
Keep dialing, Kyle.

11:46.273 --> 11:47.706
Hey, Colt, Colt, Colt!

11:47.774 --> 11:49.607
We got trouble down there!
Take a look!

11:51.778 --> 11:53.078
<i>You're crazy.</i>

11:53.146 --> 11:55.914
<i>This is as far
as I go, Mr. West.</i>

12:01.154 --> 12:02.787
My God.

12:02.856 --> 12:05.123
My God, this is not happening!

12:05.192 --> 12:06.124
Damn it.

12:06.193 --> 12:07.559
-Casey...
-I know. I know.

12:07.627 --> 12:09.561
We have to keep it together.

12:09.629 --> 12:12.330
No! We have to get
out of here, all of us.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.631
The others.
We have to go.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.266
They're at the bar!

12:15.335 --> 12:17.302
Okay, you know, I don't feel
so good after that flight.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.436
Just what are we gonna do?

12:18.505 --> 12:19.738
We gotta help
every man, woman,

12:19.806 --> 12:20.805
and child in that order.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.107
Gotta get everybody
outta here,

12:22.175 --> 12:23.241
and we haven't even
tested these yet.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.244
-Shoot it!
-Gun's not working!

12:26.313 --> 12:27.812
-It should work!
-No, it isn't.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.481
If it was working,
I would have done it!

12:29.549 --> 12:30.949
Shoot it!

12:32.085 --> 12:33.952
Yeah. Yeah!

12:34.020 --> 12:35.420
You okay, Mr. West?

12:35.489 --> 12:37.255
Hell to the yeah, baby!

12:37.324 --> 12:38.256
Yeah!

12:38.325 --> 12:39.324
Gun works.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.126
Go easy on the explosives, man.

12:41.194 --> 12:42.427
Just use the 50 millimeter
rounds.

12:42.496 --> 12:43.595
There's only 100 per round.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.597
Don't tell me what to do.

12:45.665 --> 12:46.765
-Kyle.
-Yeah?

12:46.833 --> 12:47.966
You got a stepfather,
don't you?

12:48.034 --> 12:49.801
Depends on who you ask,
but yeah.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.202
Do you call him Dad?

12:51.271 --> 12:52.470
Yeah. Sometimes.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.872
If I was
your stepfather,

12:53.940 --> 12:55.607
would you call me Dad?
Yeah.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.674
-You would?
-Yeah.

12:56.743 --> 12:57.675
-Really?
-Yeah.

12:57.744 --> 12:59.110
Now go get us
a vehicle!

12:59.179 --> 13:00.545
Okay, Dad.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.715
Ho!

13:03.784 --> 13:06.484
We're going in!

13:07.921 --> 13:09.888
-We have to hurry.
-I know.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.724
-My God.
-The music's still on.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.058
Where's Jen and Claudia?

13:14.127 --> 13:15.059
I don't know.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.628
Maybe they left before us.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.196
Without telling us?
I'm really worried.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.632
Me, too. We have to get
everyone out of here.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.633
-Hey, guys!
-Hey, guys!

13:21.701 --> 13:23.168
Hey!
Guys!

13:23.236 --> 13:25.170
Listen to us!
Stop the music!

13:25.238 --> 13:26.838
Lavalantulas are coming!

13:26.907 --> 13:27.839
What?

13:27.908 --> 13:28.873
Lavalantulas!

13:28.942 --> 13:30.041
Never heard of 'em!

13:30.110 --> 13:32.076
-They're coming!
-Cool,

13:32.145 --> 13:34.379
but I don't have
that record yet!

13:34.447 --> 13:35.713
I can't play what I don't have!

13:35.782 --> 13:37.382
-No! No!
-Listen to me!

13:37.450 --> 13:39.417
You have to clear
everyone out of here!

13:40.987 --> 13:41.920
What?

13:41.988 --> 13:43.488
The city's on fire!

13:43.557 --> 13:45.356
Hear that?!

13:45.425 --> 13:46.524
Yes.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.694
This city is on fire!

13:49.763 --> 13:51.262
-No! No!
-No!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.364
No! That's not what I meant!

13:54.634 --> 13:56.000
Cut the music!

13:56.069 --> 13:57.368
Cut the music!

14:00.273 --> 14:01.206
God.

14:06.479 --> 14:08.413
Come on! Raya!

14:08.481 --> 14:10.248
Everybody has to leave!

14:10.317 --> 14:12.383
Daniella!

14:12.452 --> 14:14.953
Please!
Get it off!

14:17.324 --> 14:18.256
Come on!

14:34.140 --> 14:37.575
Help me!

14:42.983 --> 14:43.948
We gotta split up.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.083
Not a good idea.

14:45.151 --> 14:46.217
I said split up.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.418
Not a good idea.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.419
Just do it!

14:48.488 --> 14:50.588
Yeah, I said it before.

15:01.801 --> 15:04.669
You lookin' for something, pig?

15:04.738 --> 15:05.670
Pig?

15:05.739 --> 15:08.139
No. A pig? A cop?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.808
No, no, no.
I'm not a cop.

15:10.877 --> 15:12.977
Help! Help me!
Help me, please!

15:13.046 --> 15:14.612
Okay, pig cop,

15:14.681 --> 15:16.180
you can die, too.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.149
<i>Makes no matter
to me, pendejo.</i>

15:18.218 --> 15:19.617
<i>"Pendejo"?</i>

15:19.686 --> 15:21.619
No, no, no, no,
you gotta listen to me.

15:21.688 --> 15:23.254
There's spiders
all over the city

15:23.323 --> 15:25.123
w-with flames coming
out of their mouth.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.992
Flames coming out of
their mouths! I mean,

15:28.061 --> 15:30.962
look, if we don't
all get out of here,

15:31.031 --> 15:32.964
we're gonna be corpses,
believe me.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.701
Or not.

15:39.406 --> 15:40.471
Come with me!

15:48.014 --> 15:49.614
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey,

15:49.683 --> 15:50.982
Who dat?
Who dat? Who dat?

15:51.051 --> 15:52.550
Say hello to my little friend!

15:52.619 --> 15:53.685
<i>¿cómo se llamo?</i>

15:53.753 --> 15:55.386
I'm Dave.
Nice to meet you.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.621
<i>Mi hermana tiene cataro.</i>

15:56.690 --> 15:57.789
What?

15:57.857 --> 15:58.790
I'm American!

15:58.858 --> 16:00.124
I didn't know.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.193
Run, Dave!

16:02.262 --> 16:03.227
I owe you my life!

16:03.296 --> 16:04.729
Let's go!

16:10.437 --> 16:12.837
Dave!

16:12.906 --> 16:14.072
Wait up, man.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.640
Have some of this!

16:15.709 --> 16:18.376
Have some of this, some of
this, and some of that!

16:18.445 --> 16:21.045
Have some of this and
some of this and some of that!

16:21.114 --> 16:22.347
They dead?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.048
I don't know.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.550
Damn!

16:29.222 --> 16:30.822
Get it off!

16:30.890 --> 16:32.056
-Can't get it off!
-Come on! Come on!

16:32.125 --> 16:33.091
Let's go!

16:35.395 --> 16:37.528
Man, it's a tad breezy out here.

16:37.597 --> 16:41.099
Yeah, we gotta Kyle Reese
this situation ASAP.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.443
-Where the hell is he?
-I don't know.

16:52.512 --> 16:56.136
It's so hot out here, I could
fry an egg on my face.

16:56.137 --> 16:57.849
-Nice ride, Kyle.
-Get out.

16:57.917 --> 16:59.050
He's driving, Switek.
Let's go.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.418
-Come on.
-Your stuff's in the back!

17:00.487 --> 17:01.786
Thank you, Detective Gina.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.355
Yeah. You're in the back.
Let me have it.

17:05.759 --> 17:06.723
Let's go.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.765
Wait.
Where are we going?

17:13.833 --> 17:14.766
I can't run anymore!

17:14.834 --> 17:16.200
We have to get out of here!

17:17.837 --> 17:18.770
Daniella?

17:18.838 --> 17:19.936
I'm fine.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.939
I just got burned
back at the club.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.207
Wait.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.711
What?

17:26.780 --> 17:27.744
It's nothing.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.280
It's just
slightly burned.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.082
We have to get you
some medication.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.083
Screw the medication!

17:32.152 --> 17:33.751
What are we gonna do?

17:36.956 --> 17:38.489
I have an idea.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.091
Where are you going?

17:43.563 --> 17:44.996
How we doing back there, Kyle?

17:45.065 --> 17:47.498
Well, there's nothing yet,

17:47.567 --> 17:49.834
but I did find her
on that "Find My Phone" app,

17:49.903 --> 17:51.335
and she's still
in Fort Lauderdale.

17:51.404 --> 17:54.238
Hey, hey, hey! Castillo finds
out, we're both busted again.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.240
All right.
First, we save Raya.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.742
Then we save Florida.

17:57.811 --> 17:59.777
Yeah? You save Raya.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.079
You save Florida.

18:01.147 --> 18:02.113
You save California.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.347
Who's gonna save us?

18:03.416 --> 18:06.417
We did it in LA.
We'll do it here.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.320
We get this wrong,
we're gonna get a burn notice.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.861
What is this place?

18:17.997 --> 18:19.263
Hello!

18:20.366 --> 18:22.467
What is this?
This is sick,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.635
exactly what we need.
Hey, hey, hey!

18:24.704 --> 18:27.338
Don't touch that, man! What you
doing? That's nothing to play with!

18:27.407 --> 18:30.341
Okay, that's loaded with super-cold,
compressed liquid nitrogen.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.277
I use it for house parties. Nah, I use
it to freeze the crap out of spiders,

18:33.346 --> 18:35.613
so please just put it down before
you hurt somebody. Put it down.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.282
My gosh!
Hey!

18:38.351 --> 18:39.784
-I just said put it down!
-Hey!

18:39.853 --> 18:41.978
This is a workplace, TJ!
Safety first!

18:41.979 --> 18:43.383
I know. I just told 'em...
You good, bro?

18:43.384 --> 18:44.622
I told 'em to put it down.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.691
Yo, I look like I got
eight legs and spit lava?

18:46.759 --> 18:48.025
Sorry. I'm sorry.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.527
What the hell
they doing here anyway?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.212
I don't know. They just
let themselves in.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.197
-We really need a car.
-Yeah?

18:53.266 --> 18:54.899
Well, that's
a $10,000 deposit

18:54.968 --> 18:56.421
and a three-month
waiting list.

18:56.422 --> 18:58.002
-Deposit?
-Yes.

18:58.071 --> 19:00.671
Lavalantulas are
tearing up the entire city.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.540
Yo, she right, TJ.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.475
Probably be a four-month
waiting list.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.644
What?
Did you just hear her?

19:06.713 --> 19:08.646
We all have
to get out of here!

19:08.715 --> 19:09.914
We all heard her.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.816
Half my family's
from Los Angeles.

19:11.885 --> 19:16.020
They were all killed by the
lavalantulas, rest their souls.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.055
That's why I made this gun.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.824
True. Now bye, Felicias.

19:19.893 --> 19:23.094
Yeah, well, my stepfather was
the guy who killed them all, okay?

19:25.732 --> 19:27.999
Wait a minute.
Colton West?

19:28.067 --> 19:29.200
That's your father?

19:29.269 --> 19:31.235
Stepfather, and yes.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.703
-Really?
-Really.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.539
Yo, that man's a legend.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.574
He's the reason I made this gun.
Ain't that right, Brick?

19:36.643 --> 19:39.510
Yo, "Swamp Justice,"
crazy movie.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.280
Crazy movie. Crazy...

19:42.348 --> 19:43.447
Hey, yo,
what's wrong with her?

19:43.516 --> 19:45.216
She was burned by the spiders.

19:45.285 --> 19:46.417
She really needs help,

19:46.486 --> 19:48.586
so are you guys
gonna help us or what?

19:49.856 --> 19:50.922
Please.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.591
Yo, duck. Brick!

20:09.008 --> 20:11.943
Stop!

20:14.514 --> 20:16.147
Is there a problem, officer?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.549
You can't get through this way.
You have to turn back.

20:18.618 --> 20:19.784
Hey, yo,
what's up, M.P.s?

20:19.852 --> 20:20.952
We need to get
to Fort Lauderdale.

20:21.020 --> 20:21.953
That's not possible.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.054
Listen, officer...

20:23.122 --> 20:24.655
Get back inside the car, sir.

20:24.724 --> 20:25.923
We have a serious
lavalantula outbreak.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.959
I know.
That's why we're here.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.961
No one can get through. All the
roads have been closed off.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.463
Look, I don't know if
you fellas watch the news,

20:32.532 --> 20:35.399
but we took care of these
guys in Los Angeles.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.635
My name is Colton West,
authorized movie star.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.737
I know who you are,
Mr. West.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.339
I don't care if you're the
President of the United States.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.241
No one's getting through.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.742
What the heck are those?

20:44.811 --> 20:46.444
Guns!
For killing spiders!

20:46.512 --> 20:47.645
All right,
everyone freeze.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.280
Hands up in the air.
Nobody move.

20:51.184 --> 20:53.351
Officers! Look!

20:55.555 --> 20:56.487
<i>Get down!</i>

20:57.657 --> 20:58.856
<i>Give me the gun!</i>

20:58.925 --> 21:00.825
Give me the gun!
Hurry up!

21:00.893 --> 21:02.927
God!

21:02.996 --> 21:04.595
<i>Go!</i>

21:04.664 --> 21:05.763
<i>Gun! Give me the gun!</i>

21:05.832 --> 21:07.431
Come on, man!
Get us out of here!

21:08.501 --> 21:11.702
<i>Man!</i>

21:18.177 --> 21:19.210
<i>-Look out!
-Okay, let's go.</i>

21:20.346 --> 21:21.979
<i>Yo, fool, be careful!</i>

21:22.048 --> 21:24.215
<i>My God!
My God! Hurry!</i>

21:24.284 --> 21:26.017
<i>That's what
I'm talking about, boy!</i>

21:26.085 --> 21:27.451
<i>Let's go.</i>

21:36.095 --> 21:38.195
<i>If we keep driving
in the Glades like this,</i>

21:38.264 --> 21:41.632
<i>we are going
to get stuck.</i>

21:51.611 --> 21:53.044
Damn!

21:53.112 --> 21:54.845
I hate being right.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.084
Phone call!

22:00.153 --> 22:03.020
Phone call!
Phone call!

22:03.089 --> 22:04.555
It's Wyatt.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.157
Probably asking for money.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.431
Wyatt? Wyatt?

22:13.499 --> 22:16.000
<i>Dad. Dad, are you
hearing the news?</i>

22:16.069 --> 22:19.403
Yeah. Thank God, son.
You're okay. Thank God.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.772
<i>It's happening again in Florida.
I am freaking out right now.</i>

22:21.841 --> 22:24.408
No, no, no. Wait. What do you
mean, son? What do you mean,

22:24.477 --> 22:26.043
you're freaking out? Why
are you freaking out?

22:26.112 --> 22:28.179
<i>"Why?" What do you mean,
why? You're in Florida.</i>

22:28.247 --> 22:29.680
<i>Raya is in Florida.
What...</i>

22:29.749 --> 22:30.881
Wait. Where are you?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.717
I'm... I'm on a movie set.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.418
I'm not in the jungle.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.687
I'm not stuck in the Everglades,

22:36.756 --> 22:39.123
and... and I'm not
chasing lavalantulas.

22:39.192 --> 22:40.691
<i>Who said anything
about the Everglades?</i>

22:40.760 --> 22:42.893
I didn't say...
Nothing. I'm just...

22:42.962 --> 22:44.695
Nothing, son.
Just...

22:44.764 --> 22:46.564
I'm okay.
Raya's okay.

22:46.632 --> 22:48.799
We're all fine. We're
gonna get out of here.

22:48.868 --> 22:49.967
Give my love to your mom.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.869
I love you very much, Wyatt.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.738
<i>Okay, Dad.
I love you, too.</i>

22:53.806 --> 22:55.473
And I'll see you soon.

22:55.541 --> 22:56.741
<i>Okay.</i>

22:56.809 --> 22:58.242
<i>Bye.</i>

22:59.979 --> 23:02.046
So you can get
a video chat from Wyatt,

23:02.115 --> 23:05.316
but can't get ahold of Raya.

23:05.385 --> 23:08.085
Technology. Go figure.

23:08.154 --> 23:10.488
Technology and the
fricking Everglades, man.

23:10.556 --> 23:12.456
I'm... I've had enough
of this place, man.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.558
Where's my can of Raid?

23:14.627 --> 23:18.396
I'm hot, and I'm thirsty,
and I'm tired.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.498
Kyle, you just
left the car.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.666
Okay.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.603
Dead end,
multiple directions.

23:25.671 --> 23:26.604
Plan D?

23:26.672 --> 23:27.905
Why Florida?

23:27.974 --> 23:29.440
You ever wonder why Florida?

23:29.509 --> 23:32.843
No! I mean, all the
crazy crap that happens

23:32.912 --> 23:35.179
in this country
happens in this state!

23:35.248 --> 23:38.616
A man ate another man
on the side of the freeway.

23:38.684 --> 23:42.787
I mean, a couple had to remove their
time machine from their driveway.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.322
A time machine
from their driveway!

23:45.391 --> 23:47.691
Just last month,
a man was arrested

23:47.760 --> 23:50.661
for having sex
with an alligator.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.797
No offense, Florida!

23:52.865 --> 23:55.099
But I'm surprised it
didn't happen here first!

23:55.168 --> 23:57.168
A man and an alligator? Really?

23:57.236 --> 23:58.169
Yeah, yeah.

23:58.237 --> 23:59.603
Looked it up on the Internet,

23:59.672 --> 24:00.805
one of those sites.

24:00.873 --> 24:01.806
Don't go there.

24:11.551 --> 24:15.186
Marty, if that's you, I'm
gonna shoot you in the foot.

24:15.254 --> 24:16.454
What do you expect, man?

24:16.522 --> 24:18.222
We're outside of
a floating house.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.857
What kind of a house is this?

24:19.926 --> 24:21.859
I don't know.

24:21.928 --> 24:23.828
I'm sure they got a boat,
and that's what we need.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.830
They don't even
have a yard. God.

24:25.898 --> 24:28.232
All right.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.201
Split up. Hey, man, I
don't want to split up.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.902
Every time we split up,
what happens?

24:31.971 --> 24:34.338
Like in the damn movies, man.
I don't want to split up.

24:34.407 --> 24:35.840
Marty, help me out.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.508
Just go around.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.176
Come on, man.
Let's go around.

24:39.245 --> 24:41.178
The dude said split up, man.
Go around.

24:42.482 --> 24:43.514
Go ahead.

24:44.817 --> 24:47.585
Still alive.

25:10.276 --> 25:11.942
Quiet.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.177
You see?

25:15.615 --> 25:17.882
Over there on my wood crapper.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.084
Over there.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.055
I see you.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.802
Boy, you smell purty.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.137
Where are we going?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.572
Anywhere these spiders ain't.

25:41.641 --> 25:44.108
-Where's that?
-Pittsburgh.

25:44.176 --> 25:46.410
We ain't never been
to Pittsburgh before.

25:46.479 --> 25:48.045
What are you even
talking about?

25:48.114 --> 25:49.914
Slow down, TJ!

25:49.982 --> 25:51.248
What is that?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.050
The road!

25:54.220 --> 25:55.719
Great! Now what?

25:55.788 --> 25:56.987
Stay here.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.660
Brick, how we gonna
get around that?

26:02.728 --> 26:03.661
I don't know.

26:03.729 --> 26:04.662
Yeah, this hole...

26:04.730 --> 26:06.497
Look out!

26:06.566 --> 26:08.499
Look up!

26:08.568 --> 26:09.600
Let's do this!

26:17.977 --> 26:19.109
Damn.

26:19.178 --> 26:21.579
No.

26:21.647 --> 26:22.580
I'm out.

26:22.648 --> 26:23.747
My God.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.449
Me, too, bro. Damn.

26:26.519 --> 26:28.118
Sh...

26:28.187 --> 26:29.787
-Back up!
-Go!

26:29.855 --> 26:30.854
-Go!
-Go!

26:30.923 --> 26:32.156
-Hey, get us outta here!
-Go!

26:32.224 --> 26:33.924
Hey!

26:33.993 --> 26:35.426
I got a plan.

26:35.494 --> 26:37.695
You colder than a
penguin's toenail.

26:41.400 --> 26:42.600
Yeah.

26:42.668 --> 26:44.602
-My God.
-Look at that.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.537
That is amazing.

26:46.606 --> 26:48.606
Yo, but we out
of liquid nitrogen.

26:48.674 --> 26:50.874
How the hell we supposed
to get more of that now?

26:50.943 --> 26:52.943
The school
at the medical lab.

26:53.012 --> 26:54.845
-What school?
-Miami North University

26:54.914 --> 26:56.447
just a few miles
down the road.

26:56.515 --> 26:57.881
We go there.

26:57.950 --> 26:59.383
Yo, what's the mascot?

26:59.452 --> 27:02.019
I... I don't know.
I'm a medical student.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.655
But they keep a stockpile
of it for experiments.

27:04.724 --> 27:06.290
I do not like this idea.

27:06.359 --> 27:07.891
I like it.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.293
TJ!

27:09.362 --> 27:12.062
Yo, I do not
like this idea!

27:12.131 --> 27:13.731
What the heck was that?

27:13.799 --> 27:15.566
My.
It's a little girl.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.701
No, no, no!
They're okay! They're okay!

27:17.770 --> 27:19.370
He's okay.

27:19.438 --> 27:21.805
We're being hunted.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.676
What that was
was the first wave.

27:25.745 --> 27:26.744
What do you mean,
"first wave"?

27:26.812 --> 27:29.246
Well, first there were them,

27:29.315 --> 27:32.416
snakehead frankenfish.

27:32.485 --> 27:35.853
Then everybody got crazy
about them Burmese pythons.

27:35.921 --> 27:36.987
Aha.

27:37.056 --> 27:38.222
And now we got,

27:38.290 --> 27:40.024
-lavalantulas.
-Yeah.

27:40.092 --> 27:43.227
Don't they know how delicate
our ecosystem is out here?

27:43.295 --> 27:45.996
All right. How do we
get to Fort Lauderdale?

27:46.065 --> 27:49.166
Well, I'd say your best bet...

27:49.235 --> 27:51.502
is I-95.

27:51.570 --> 27:52.703
Jeez!

27:52.772 --> 27:54.405
National Guard
closed it.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.573
Well, can you get
us across anyway?

27:56.642 --> 27:57.841
Can we just take
that boat right there?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.543
That boat's got
a flat tire.

27:59.612 --> 28:01.912
Strange things
have been happening.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.213
I ain't been
out there in weeks.

28:03.282 --> 28:04.581
Why is that?

28:04.650 --> 28:06.050
Well, about two weeks ago,

28:06.118 --> 28:08.886
the manatees started
beaching themselves.

28:08.954 --> 28:10.554
Didn't think
much of it.

28:10.623 --> 28:12.690
Then all of a sudden,
these outcroppings

28:12.758 --> 28:14.358
started to rise from the Glades.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.760
Look, I appreciate your
passion for this stuff,

28:16.829 --> 28:19.229
but we got a
life-and-death situation.

28:19.298 --> 28:22.299
Mister, you're talking to
Florida's number one gator man.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.536
Name's Jim Dundee.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.872
But, hey, strawberry, you
can call me Alligator.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.642
Alligator Dundee?

28:31.711 --> 28:32.910
What?

28:32.978 --> 28:35.079
Well, it's like,

28:35.147 --> 28:37.414
Alligator Dundee,
it's kind of like...

28:37.483 --> 28:38.582
Kind of like what?

28:38.651 --> 28:40.951
Well, it's quite similar to...

28:41.020 --> 28:43.320
Like a superhero doing his
thing. Yeah, you know.

28:43.389 --> 28:44.788
It's nothing!
It's nothing!

28:44.857 --> 28:46.924
Look, can you get us across?

28:46.992 --> 28:48.425
You wanna get across?

28:48.494 --> 28:49.893
Then you talk to me.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.328
But I thought that's
what we were doing.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.830
-Do what?
-Talking to you.

28:52.898 --> 28:54.064
I'm talking to you
to talk to me.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.632
-Yeah, I know.
-I said you talk to me.

28:55.701 --> 28:57.434
No, I understand that.
Then who you talking to?

28:57.503 --> 28:59.069
I'm... Nothing.
I apologize.

28:59.138 --> 29:01.004
Do you have a boat
that works?

29:01.073 --> 29:03.140
-Do I have a boat that works?
-Yeah.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.075
Sure. Follow me.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.628
It's deserted.

29:24.697 --> 29:26.363
There must have
been an evacuation.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.365
If there was an evacuation,

29:28.434 --> 29:31.034
then either spiders are
coming, or they're here.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.304
We need to get in and out
as quickly as possible.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.206
Help her.
We need to talk.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.341
Okay.

29:37.409 --> 29:39.343
Your friend,
was she burned or bit?

29:39.411 --> 29:41.178
I don't know. Why.

29:41.247 --> 29:43.480
Your father, Colton, he didn't
tell you what happened in LA?

29:43.549 --> 29:45.115
I mean, I know what
everyone else knows,

29:45.184 --> 29:46.950
but my family doesn't
like to talk about it.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.386
No, I heard some crazy stuff that
happened when people got bit.

29:49.455 --> 29:50.654
Like what?

29:50.723 --> 29:52.322
I don't know.
I'm not from LA,

29:52.391 --> 29:54.158
so I don't know. I'm
not even... Like what?

29:55.728 --> 29:57.661
I heard
that if you got bit,

29:57.730 --> 29:59.696
you become a host
to baby spiders,

29:59.765 --> 30:02.065
like, thousands of 'em.
Like, they just,

30:02.134 --> 30:03.333
you know, burst
out of your body.

30:03.402 --> 30:04.334
You know what I'm saying?

30:07.239 --> 30:08.505
That's what I heard,
all right?

30:08.574 --> 30:10.808
She got burned,
okay?

30:15.581 --> 30:16.847
So is that
little strawberry

30:16.916 --> 30:18.515
a real close friend
of yours?

30:18.584 --> 30:20.184
Yeah, yeah,
just a distant relative.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.185
I'm right here.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.353
I can hear you.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.922
There you go! Look
at that right there.

30:24.990 --> 30:26.156
There's an outcropping.

30:26.225 --> 30:27.658
Boy, I ain't ever seen anything

30:27.726 --> 30:28.859
like that
in my whole life.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.260
Have you ever seen
anything like that?

30:30.329 --> 30:31.595
Didn't I just say that?
Yeah.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.198
Hey, Colton, what do
you think that is?

30:34.266 --> 30:37.100
Hell of a coincidence.

30:38.170 --> 30:39.269
All right!

30:40.371 --> 30:43.407
Lavalantulas!
Over there! Over there!

30:43.475 --> 30:45.375
Come on! Get some of this!
Come on! Come on!

30:45.444 --> 30:46.543
On the crapper!
On the crapper!

30:46.612 --> 30:48.612
I want some of this!

30:48.681 --> 30:49.913
Hey!
Get down!

30:51.550 --> 30:52.482
Off to the boat!

30:52.551 --> 30:53.817
To the boat!

30:53.886 --> 30:55.886
Let's go!

30:55.955 --> 30:57.554
Have ever seen them
do this before?!

30:57.623 --> 30:59.623
It's a new breed!
Get in the boat!

30:59.692 --> 31:03.627
Just get in the boat! Yah!

31:03.696 --> 31:05.629
-Gator.
-Dundee?

31:05.698 --> 31:06.730
Yeah!

31:06.799 --> 31:08.498
Get that knife
behind you!

31:08.567 --> 31:10.667
Hey!
Kill that thing, man!

31:12.571 --> 31:13.637
You okay?
I'm okay.

31:13.706 --> 31:14.638
I got you.

31:14.707 --> 31:15.639
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

31:15.708 --> 31:17.307
I got you.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.742
-No, I feel secure.
-You do.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.477
-No, I feel safe.
-There's one!

31:21.647 --> 31:23.647
Come on, man!

31:24.335 --> 31:26.116
Get us out of here, man!
Go! Go! Go!

31:34.026 --> 31:37.961
I mean, we were stuck
inside a ring of lava!

31:38.030 --> 31:42.132
But we sure taught
those guys something.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.468
We gave them two cents,
okay?

31:44.536 --> 31:46.770
We took the fight
to those suckers!

31:46.839 --> 31:49.039
Wait. Is this where
my highly paid star is?

31:49.108 --> 31:50.707
Taking the fight
to these things?

31:50.776 --> 31:52.342
I ain't saying anything.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.611
Here come the cavalry!

31:54.680 --> 31:55.612
Come on, guys.

31:57.349 --> 31:59.316
Where's Colton West?

31:59.385 --> 32:02.352
Good. Are you guys
here to evacuate us?

32:02.421 --> 32:04.955
I am Colonel Nathan R. Jester

32:05.024 --> 32:07.190
with the Army
Corps of Engineers,

32:07.259 --> 32:10.360
and I'm looking
for a Colton West.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.362
I was told he was here.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.165
Can you tell me where I
might find Colton West?

32:15.234 --> 32:17.000
Well, I could think
of a few places.

32:17.069 --> 32:18.001
Well, name one.

32:18.070 --> 32:20.170
The unemployment office.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.371
How 'bout another?

32:21.440 --> 32:23.073
The studio blacklist.

32:23.142 --> 32:24.174
Yeah.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.809
-All right.
-Where are you going?

32:25.878 --> 32:27.811
Let's set up a mobile
command station right here!

32:27.880 --> 32:29.146
No. No.
Move out!

32:29.214 --> 32:31.214
No one's going in there!

32:31.283 --> 32:33.750
That is a hot set!
That's a hot set!

32:33.819 --> 32:36.320
That's movie talk for
you can't move anything.

32:36.388 --> 32:37.721
It's movie talk.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.156
Studio blacklist?

32:39.224 --> 32:41.158
You think this is funny?

32:41.226 --> 32:43.160
Colonel Jester,
I don't think

32:43.228 --> 32:45.929
there's anything funny
about this at all.

32:45.998 --> 32:47.698
Colonel Jester...

32:49.001 --> 32:50.734
is a little bit funny.

32:50.803 --> 32:52.402
It's a little bit funny,
yeah.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.371
You know, I do not
like your attitude.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.673
You know, no one does.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.241
That's what makes me
a good director.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.010
So are you here
to evacuate us or what?

33:00.079 --> 33:02.212
Well, we'll talk
about that.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.181
But right now,
for the fourth time,

33:04.249 --> 33:07.884
I'm gonna ask you, can you tell
me where I can find Colton?

33:09.955 --> 33:16.093
This is a matter
of national security.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.260
General...

33:17.329 --> 33:18.295
Colonel.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.296
Colonel...

33:19.365 --> 33:20.897
he could be on a fan boat

33:20.966 --> 33:23.133
in the middle of the
Everglades for all I know.

33:38.784 --> 33:40.417
What's happening?
How's Gator?

33:40.486 --> 33:42.786
Not good, man.

33:42.855 --> 33:44.221
Jim's dead, Colton.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.557
I think I can save him!

33:47.626 --> 33:48.792
<i>-Come on!
-I stopped the bleeding,</i>

33:48.861 --> 33:51.579
<i>or he ran out of blood,
one of the two.</i>

33:51.580 --> 33:52.475
He's gone, yo.

33:52.476 --> 33:53.797
Do you even know
where you're going?

33:53.866 --> 33:55.298
<i>Kyle, we're in a swamp.</i>

33:55.367 --> 33:57.734
Of course I don't know
where we're going.

33:57.803 --> 34:00.670
Wait.

34:00.739 --> 34:01.738
Got it.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.440
Thank...

34:03.509 --> 34:04.674
Go that way!

34:09.348 --> 34:10.813
No, no, no, no, no.

34:10.882 --> 34:12.416
That way!

34:30.235 --> 34:31.237
A'ight, where they at?

34:31.239 --> 34:32.803
Where they at?
Where we at?

34:33.906 --> 34:34.938
What's up, man?

34:35.007 --> 34:36.639
Hey, yo, Brick.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.542
Don't lose these.

34:38.610 --> 34:40.444
Okay.

34:41.880 --> 34:44.648
Are you okay, girl?

34:44.716 --> 34:48.284
I think my burn is
making me feel sick.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.654
Okay. You're gonna
be fine, okay?

34:50.722 --> 34:51.955
Man.

34:52.024 --> 34:54.123
Hey, guys,

34:54.193 --> 34:55.826
it's a cold room.

34:55.893 --> 34:57.828
Come on.
In here.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.198
Okay.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.199
Okay.

35:02.267 --> 35:03.200
Okay.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.303
Damn, it's cold in here.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.506
It has to be to
keep things fresh.

35:12.044 --> 35:14.811
We got 'em.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.315
Come on.

35:20.919 --> 35:22.552
Is everybody okay?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.821
Jim's
still dead, man.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.023
I meant you girls!

35:27.092 --> 35:28.391
I'm fine.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.727
Where the hell are we, Kyle?

35:30.796 --> 35:31.995
Give me a second.

35:37.069 --> 35:38.535
By my calculations,

35:38.604 --> 35:40.837
we're about 40 miles west
of Fort Lauderdale.

35:40.906 --> 35:43.507
That's not good enough!
We gotta get to Raya!

35:43.575 --> 35:45.175
Well, she's...
Hey, wait.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.576
She's at her school.

35:46.645 --> 35:48.879
Wait a minute! Why would
she go to her school?

35:48.947 --> 35:50.580
Because she wants
to be a geologist.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.582
All right, we gotta
get to that school.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.518
What about...
What about Alligator,

35:54.586 --> 35:55.919
who died of natural causes?

35:55.988 --> 35:57.787
That's what he
would have wanted.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.689
He's a swamp man.

35:59.758 --> 36:00.924
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

36:00.993 --> 36:02.292
News flash.

36:02.361 --> 36:05.028
We are in the middle
of nowhere!

36:06.165 --> 36:07.531
Hear that?

36:07.599 --> 36:10.267
People?

36:10.335 --> 36:11.868
I smell popcorn.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.907
And I'm gonna eat it.

36:16.975 --> 36:19.442
She's been with us for 20 years!

36:19.511 --> 36:20.477
That's right.

36:20.546 --> 36:24.214
Green!
We call her Mean Green.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.383
She ain't the biggest,

36:26.451 --> 36:30.921
but she's the meanest captive
alligator in the Everglades!

36:37.592 --> 36:39.526
It's an alligator show.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.334
That's not part of the show.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.437
Keep going! Go!

36:47.506 --> 36:49.506
Move! Move! Move!
Keep going!

36:51.310 --> 36:52.275
Come on!

36:59.551 --> 37:02.185
Come on!
Keep moving, everyone!

37:03.655 --> 37:04.955
Move!

37:05.023 --> 37:06.856
Keep moving!
Keep moving!

37:06.925 --> 37:08.992
Keep moving!

37:10.896 --> 37:12.495
Move it! Move it!

37:12.564 --> 37:15.832
Move! Move it!

37:15.901 --> 37:17.200
Yo, let's load the guns up, bro.
Where the guns at?

37:17.269 --> 37:18.335
Don't you have 'em?

37:18.403 --> 37:20.036
Man, do I look like I got 'em?

37:20.105 --> 37:21.438
No.

37:21.506 --> 37:22.939
Dude, I told you
to get 'em from the truck.

37:23.008 --> 37:23.974
That ain't
what you said.

37:24.042 --> 37:25.342
Man, yeah, I did, man.

37:25.410 --> 37:26.943
You told me to help
what's-his-face here!

37:27.012 --> 37:28.211
-No, I didn't, man!
-Okay, enough!

37:29.448 --> 37:30.880
I'll grab the guns.

37:30.949 --> 37:34.150
All right, I'll help you if
that's what you trying to do.

37:50.202 --> 37:53.937
Back away from the lavalantula.

38:11.890 --> 38:13.757
It's not doing anything.

38:13.825 --> 38:14.791
What is happening?

38:14.860 --> 38:16.426
Why isn't it attacking me?

38:16.495 --> 38:17.673
It's like it doesn't see you.

38:17.674 --> 38:21.097
It's the cold.
That has to be it.

38:21.166 --> 38:24.301
We're so cold that it
doesn't see us a-as living.

38:24.369 --> 38:27.270
You mean, because I'm freezing,
it sees me as a chair?

38:27.339 --> 38:28.872
Nah, it probably
sees me as a chair.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.874
It probably sees you
as like a couch or something.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.877
Whatever. So as long as we
are cold, we're safe?

38:33.945 --> 38:35.879
Well, we're gonna die
if we stay in here,

38:35.947 --> 38:38.014
and we're gonna die
if we go out there.

38:38.083 --> 38:40.016
Man, wish we had guns
right now.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.018
But maybe if we keep our body
temperature cold enough,

38:42.087 --> 38:43.720
we can go get the guns.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.622
With the liquid nitrogen tanks.

38:45.691 --> 38:48.325
Like they use in cryotherapy.

38:48.393 --> 38:50.327
-Cryo-what? What...
-Therapy. It's the use

38:50.395 --> 38:52.896
of really low temperatures
in medical treatments.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.297
That's it.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.167
I don't like this idea.

38:57.235 --> 38:59.903
I do not like this idea.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.183
You saved my life!

39:13.251 --> 39:14.417
Thank you!

39:14.486 --> 39:15.652
My pleasure.
You know who I am,

39:15.721 --> 39:16.986
don't you?

39:17.055 --> 39:19.189
You recognize me
from movies and television?

39:19.257 --> 39:20.557
What about, Red Rocket?

39:20.625 --> 39:21.658
"Hey, I'm the Red Rocket!"

39:21.727 --> 39:24.094
Or... Or, "There's Hell to Pay!"

39:24.162 --> 39:25.862
What about the condom
commercial in the nineties?

39:25.931 --> 39:27.364
"This isn't mine.
It's too big!"

39:27.432 --> 39:28.932
No? What about,
"Hey, nice pants."

39:29.000 --> 39:30.367
Nice pants?
"Nice tattoo."

39:30.435 --> 39:32.001
He doesn't know who
you are, Colton! Sorry!

39:32.070 --> 39:33.837
Okay. I'm just trying
to talk to the man.

39:33.905 --> 39:36.840
That chopper,
do you know who owns it?

39:36.908 --> 39:38.174
Zed.
Zed. Where's Zed?

39:38.243 --> 39:40.210
Zed's dead, man.
Zed's dead.

39:40.278 --> 39:41.211
Well, do you know
how to fly it?

39:41.279 --> 39:42.278
Not a lick!

39:42.347 --> 39:43.580
Okay! Do you mind if we take it?

39:43.648 --> 39:44.581
-If it works!
-If it works?

39:44.649 --> 39:46.049
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

39:46.118 --> 39:47.283
What's going through
your mind, Colton West?

39:47.352 --> 39:49.119
A little flick
I did in the nineties

39:49.187 --> 39:50.253
called "Air Bandits."
Big hit.

39:50.322 --> 39:52.021
That was 20 years ago.

39:52.090 --> 39:54.391
It was three hours training.
They cut the scene.

39:54.459 --> 39:56.693
That's not a plan A.
What's your plan B?

39:56.762 --> 39:57.727
I'll catch you later.

39:57.796 --> 39:58.762
I'll catch you later.

39:58.830 --> 40:00.196
-You know that one?
-Yeah, yeah!

40:00.265 --> 40:01.464
Catch you later!
Catch you later.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.732
He remembers!
Catch you...

40:02.801 --> 40:04.134
Colton, you can't fly
that chopper!

40:04.202 --> 40:06.403
You got 847-to-3 odds.

40:06.471 --> 40:07.971
Never tell me the odds!

40:08.039 --> 40:09.806
And it was
four hours training!

40:09.875 --> 40:12.475
And 25 years ago...

40:15.814 --> 40:18.415
Yo, I'm so cold,

40:18.483 --> 40:21.251
I could hug
a lavalantula right now.

40:21.319 --> 40:22.952
Okay, that should
be enough.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.988
Yeah, we should
be cold enough.

40:25.056 --> 40:26.623
We just gotta head
to the truck

40:26.691 --> 40:28.491
and grab the guns, okay?
Okay.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.460
But we gotta move slow.

40:30.529 --> 40:31.728
Give me the keys.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.630
I put 'em on the table.

40:33.698 --> 40:35.432
What the... Why?

40:35.500 --> 40:36.966
I didn't want
to lose 'em.

40:37.035 --> 40:41.070
Okay, let's go, but slowly.

40:41.139 --> 40:43.573
Moving faster will raise our
body temps too quickly.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.276
And mine rises much faster
than the rest of y'all's.

40:50.482 --> 40:54.350
Okay, TJ and I will
go out there.

40:54.419 --> 40:56.252
Brick, stay with Daniella.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.455
It's safer in here. And then
once we reload the guns,

40:58.523 --> 40:59.456
we'll come back
for you.

40:59.524 --> 41:00.790
Nuh.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.525
Let's go.
Come on.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.761
Hey, yo, two words!

41:04.830 --> 41:06.196
Don't die.

41:07.332 --> 41:09.265
-Come on.
-Let's go.

41:11.436 --> 41:12.869
Stay over there.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.204
You gonna be good.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.508
Expensive.

41:18.577 --> 41:19.509
All right.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.810
Okay.

41:20.879 --> 41:22.679
Button, button.
Who's got the button?

41:23.748 --> 41:25.815
<i>-Too low.
-No. No.</i>

41:25.884 --> 41:27.317
Yes. Yes.

41:31.389 --> 41:33.022
Aha.

41:35.460 --> 41:37.527
Just like I remember.

41:45.270 --> 41:49.405
Well, fellas, I think I'm gonna be
pretty good at this flying thing.

41:49.474 --> 41:51.841
Hey! Hey!

41:51.910 --> 41:55.044
You want my opinion on that?

41:55.113 --> 41:56.713
Okay?

41:56.781 --> 41:59.382
Just a little bump
in the road, ladies.

41:59.451 --> 42:03.086
Kyle, I'm gonna need you to keep
an eye on Raya's coordinates.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.687
You're gonna be my GPS.

42:04.756 --> 42:06.723
I'm gonna need you
to keep us in the air!

42:06.791 --> 42:07.724
You're my pilot!

42:07.792 --> 42:10.593
Piece of cake.

42:59.678 --> 43:01.578
Okay.

43:01.646 --> 43:03.112
Where they go?

43:04.215 --> 43:05.481
Okay. Almost there.

43:32.877 --> 43:34.677
Okay.

44:07.245 --> 44:09.012
Get the door.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.780
I am

44:20.759 --> 44:21.724
Go! Go!

44:21.793 --> 44:23.693
Run!

44:23.762 --> 44:25.662
Go, go, go!

44:54.125 --> 44:56.426
Man, I hope they made it.

44:56.494 --> 44:58.394
Brick, can you
please look at my burn?

44:58.463 --> 45:00.663
I feel really weird,
like I'm gonna...

45:00.732 --> 45:03.232
Like I'm gonna hurl
or something.

45:03.301 --> 45:04.367
Yo, I'm a mechanic.

45:04.436 --> 45:06.202
I work on cars,
not spider burns.

45:06.271 --> 45:07.437
Brick, please?

45:10.408 --> 45:11.340
All right.

45:19.818 --> 45:21.451
-What?
-Nothing.

45:21.519 --> 45:22.919
Nothing. It looks good.

45:22.987 --> 45:24.554
I don't know what it
was like before,

45:24.622 --> 45:26.089
but you gonna be all right.

45:26.157 --> 45:27.590
It doesn't hurt
as bad as before.

45:27.659 --> 45:29.092
I think the cold is helping it.

45:33.665 --> 45:35.098
Hoo.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.766
Snap!

45:38.369 --> 45:39.302
My...

45:39.370 --> 45:41.104
No!

45:41.172 --> 45:42.638
Get out of here.

45:44.209 --> 45:45.875
Open the door! No.

45:47.846 --> 45:50.546
Come on.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.982
No!

45:53.051 --> 45:54.751
Come on!

45:54.819 --> 45:55.785
Hey!

45:55.854 --> 45:57.754
-Move!
-What happened?

45:57.822 --> 45:58.921
-Move!
-Raya, no.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.156
Where's Daniella?

46:00.225 --> 46:01.591
Raya. Raya.
She ain't gonna make it!

46:01.659 --> 46:02.592
-What? No!
-Take her! Go!

46:02.660 --> 46:03.760
Raya, no!
Raya, come on!

46:03.828 --> 46:05.161
-We can't leave her!
-No! Come on!

46:08.800 --> 46:10.133
We're right above her!

46:10.201 --> 46:11.501
I'm gonna take her down.

46:11.569 --> 46:12.935
She's moving faster!

46:13.004 --> 46:14.137
That could only mean...

46:14.205 --> 46:16.105
-She's in trouble.
-Man.

46:16.174 --> 46:17.974
Are you sure you
can land this thing?

46:18.042 --> 46:19.976
Never underestimate me,
Marty.

46:20.044 --> 46:21.410
You know that.

46:33.892 --> 46:35.091
Brick, my gun's jammed.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.127
Brick, save your ammo, man!

46:40.665 --> 46:42.698
Brick!

46:44.569 --> 46:45.768
There's way
too many of 'em.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.104
They're too lava,
too lantula!

46:48.173 --> 46:49.438
Get outta here.

46:49.507 --> 46:51.440
Brick! No, man! No!

46:51.509 --> 46:52.942
-We have to go, TJ!
-No.

46:54.612 --> 46:55.645
Let's do this!

47:02.187 --> 47:04.320
Man, I don't want to die today.

47:04.389 --> 47:06.291
We're not gonna die. We just
have to keep it together.

47:06.292 --> 47:08.291
Brick's gone, okay?
Brick's gone.

47:08.359 --> 47:09.692
Listen to me.

47:09.761 --> 47:10.993
Listen to me.

47:11.062 --> 47:12.695
I lost
my best friend, too.

47:14.065 --> 47:16.999
But we're gonna
get out of here, okay?

47:17.068 --> 47:18.401
I promise.

47:28.813 --> 47:30.179
-Wait.
-Okay.

47:36.387 --> 47:37.720
Okay.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.460
Go, go, go!

48:51.529 --> 48:52.995
Go, go! Go, go, go!

48:53.064 --> 48:54.263
Keep going! Keep going!

48:54.332 --> 48:55.965
Don't wait for me!
Keep going.

49:02.407 --> 49:03.739
Where's the gun?

49:03.808 --> 49:06.309
It's still in the
kitchen right now.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.180
My God.

49:13.251 --> 49:14.417
Damn it.

49:15.653 --> 49:17.653
God.

49:17.722 --> 49:19.188
-Come on!
-I'm coming.

49:19.257 --> 49:20.589
Leave us alone.

49:34.205 --> 49:35.371
No, no, no.

49:38.676 --> 49:41.944
<i>-What are we gonna do?
-They're everywhere.</i>

50:04.235 --> 50:06.369
Hey!

50:13.277 --> 50:14.243
Colton!

50:16.547 --> 50:19.749
Yes! Yeah!

50:19.817 --> 50:20.750
Hey.

50:23.087 --> 50:24.153
Wait. Wait.

50:24.222 --> 50:25.221
Wait. Wait.

50:25.289 --> 50:26.756
Raya! You got a boyfriend.

50:26.824 --> 50:27.923
-Raya.
-Colton!

50:27.992 --> 50:29.825
Ho ho.

50:29.894 --> 50:31.160
Thank goodness.
You're okay.

50:31.229 --> 50:33.696
Daniella's dead.
Everyone's dead.

50:33.765 --> 50:35.164
I'm so sorry.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.333
I'm so sorry, honey.
I promise you,

50:37.402 --> 50:38.501
everything's
gonna be okay.

50:38.569 --> 50:40.036
I didn't think
you'd come.

50:40.104 --> 50:42.238
Well, if you would answer
your phone once in a while.

50:42.306 --> 50:43.739
What do you mean,
I wouldn't come?

50:43.808 --> 50:45.775
How could I not
come back for you?

50:45.843 --> 50:48.511
You're my daughter.

50:48.579 --> 50:50.713
It's gonna be okay.
That ain't true.

50:50.782 --> 50:51.747
Ain't nothing gonna be okay.

50:51.816 --> 50:52.882
Who's he?

50:52.950 --> 50:55.351
That's TJ.
Saved my life.

50:55.420 --> 50:57.286
Yo, I'm a great fan,
man, a big fan.

50:57.355 --> 50:59.755
Thanks for coming for us, man.
I got a gun!

50:59.824 --> 51:01.390
I made a gun,
and you inspired it.

51:01.459 --> 51:03.426
It's in there. I'm gonna
go get it for you.

51:03.494 --> 51:04.794
Okay, you can thank us later.

51:04.862 --> 51:06.595
Right now we are not
out of the woods yet.

51:06.664 --> 51:08.631
We've got to find her
and kill her.

51:08.699 --> 51:10.599
-Find who?
-These are just babies.

51:10.668 --> 51:11.734
The mama's
hiding somewhere.

51:11.803 --> 51:13.636
When this happened
in Los Angeles,

51:13.704 --> 51:16.372
the good Dr. Von Struble gave
us a thermal image of the city.

51:16.441 --> 51:17.606
We were able to find her.

51:17.675 --> 51:19.041
I can do that.

51:19.110 --> 51:20.910
Thermal, spectral,
infrared.

51:20.978 --> 51:23.379
Last semester, I did my
thesis on global drought

51:23.448 --> 51:24.814
and raising
global temperatures.

51:24.882 --> 51:27.249
We had access to all the
satellite information.

51:27.318 --> 51:28.250
Show us, honey.

51:28.319 --> 51:30.653
Just follow me.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.822
You got a cool-ass daughter, Mr.
West.

51:32.890 --> 51:34.323
Don't even think about it.
I...

51:34.392 --> 51:35.758
I don't want it
crossing your mind.

51:35.827 --> 51:37.293
How you know...
You got me?

51:37.361 --> 51:38.828
Can...

51:38.896 --> 51:40.496
Okay.
All right.

51:40.565 --> 51:42.164
So we gotta get that chopper
operational. Can you do it?

51:42.233 --> 51:44.567
Come on, man. What happens
every time we split up?

51:44.635 --> 51:45.568
Weird stuff happens.

51:45.636 --> 51:46.769
Come on, Marty.

51:46.838 --> 51:48.304
How 'bout we split up
temporarily?

51:48.372 --> 51:50.973
I get the chopper,
and I'll meet you out front.

51:51.042 --> 51:53.275
-Great idea.
-All right? Cool.

52:04.355 --> 52:05.321
Go!

52:13.564 --> 52:17.099
Sir. We think we've
located Colton West.

52:17.168 --> 52:19.001
Well, get him on the line.

52:19.070 --> 52:20.769
What did you do to my set?

52:20.838 --> 52:22.104
You wrecked my set!
Wait.

52:22.173 --> 52:23.439
Did I hear you correctly?

52:23.508 --> 52:24.807
Did you find that S.O.B.?

52:24.876 --> 52:26.876
Did you find them?
Are they okay?

52:26.944 --> 52:28.944
Will you get these morons
out of my office?

52:29.013 --> 52:29.979
Yes, sir.

52:30.047 --> 52:31.480
Wait! This is crazy!

52:31.549 --> 52:33.849
You can't take me off
my own movie set, General!

52:33.918 --> 52:36.485
It is Colonel, and this is
now a military operation.

52:36.554 --> 52:39.388
I can do whatever
the hell I want to do.

52:39.457 --> 52:41.957
Now, Private, please get
these people out of my face!

52:42.026 --> 52:45.628
Don't you touch me!

52:45.696 --> 52:47.830
I'm gonna go
under my own accord.

52:47.899 --> 52:49.031
Humph!

52:49.100 --> 52:51.133
Don't let me
die on "Clown Cops"!

52:51.202 --> 52:52.868
This can't be my last movie.

52:52.937 --> 52:55.738
We're so overbudget.

52:58.809 --> 53:00.576
Something like this?

53:00.645 --> 53:02.411
Exactly like that.

53:02.480 --> 53:04.513
Now zoom in on Miami.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.650
Brilliant.

53:07.718 --> 53:09.852
And you thought I was
only partying, Colt.

53:09.921 --> 53:11.587
When did I say that?

53:11.656 --> 53:14.757
I never said that. I never
said you were only partying.

53:14.825 --> 53:18.060
So that's it? You think
that's the mamalantula?

53:18.129 --> 53:21.830
That is one massive heat
signature under Miami.

53:21.899 --> 53:24.233
Whatever it is, it is huge.

53:24.302 --> 53:26.268
What, the mamalantula?

53:26.337 --> 53:30.039
No, no, no, no.
That's much, much bigger.

53:30.107 --> 53:32.508
That's no mamalantula.

53:32.577 --> 53:37.346
That's a freaking
gargantulantula.

53:37.415 --> 53:39.548
Mamalantulantula.

53:39.617 --> 53:42.451
What?

53:42.520 --> 53:44.186
The... The mama tarantula?

53:44.255 --> 53:46.288
No. Gargantulantula.

53:46.357 --> 53:47.556
Gorgantulantula?

53:47.625 --> 53:48.557
What? Is it...

53:48.626 --> 53:50.359
Gor... The gorgantula? No.

53:50.428 --> 53:52.695
Yes... No, it's a gargantulantula.

53:52.763 --> 53:54.964
-It's a gor...
-Mormalantula?

53:55.032 --> 53:57.700
-With an "O"?
-No, with a G-A-R, gar.

53:57.768 --> 53:59.101
-Gargan... Gargantu...
-Gargar...

53:59.170 --> 54:00.102
-Gargantula.
-Gargan...

54:00.171 --> 54:01.237
What's the last part?

54:01.305 --> 54:03.739
-Say it slow. Just say...
-Gargan...

54:03.808 --> 54:05.374
It's very, very bad.
It's very bad.

54:12.049 --> 54:13.616
That's the government.

54:13.684 --> 54:15.117
How do you know that?

54:16.654 --> 54:19.955
'Cause it's ringing
really weird.

54:21.192 --> 54:22.124
Hello.

54:22.193 --> 54:23.259
Colton West?

54:23.327 --> 54:24.593
Speaking.

54:24.662 --> 54:26.962
<i>Yeah, this is,
Colonel Nathan R. Jester.</i>

54:27.031 --> 54:29.431
You are familiar with the
situation down in Florida?

54:29.500 --> 54:31.967
Yeah, slightly.

54:32.036 --> 54:35.004
<i>Yeah, well,
you are the only one</i>

54:35.072 --> 54:36.905
<i>that has successfully
dealt with these things...</i>

54:36.974 --> 54:37.973
I'm sorry.

54:38.042 --> 54:42.011
And, I need your help,
and I need your team.

54:42.079 --> 54:43.012
<i>Great.</i>

54:43.080 --> 54:44.847
Then come pick us up.

54:44.915 --> 54:47.616
No can do. You're
located in a hot zone.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.285
Yeah, in a hot zone.

54:49.353 --> 54:51.287
Believe me, I been
through this before.

54:51.355 --> 54:54.123
-I know you have.
-I know you have.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.792
Well, I got an idea.
If you listen to me, I...

54:56.861 --> 54:58.494
No, you listen to me,
General.

54:58.562 --> 54:59.995
It's Colonel.

55:00.064 --> 55:02.298
Colonel, you listen to me.

55:02.366 --> 55:03.832
<i>You position your satellites</i>

55:03.901 --> 55:06.969
for a thermal image
of Miami stat.

55:08.239 --> 55:09.371
You found her.

55:09.440 --> 55:11.373
<i>I found something,
'cause this one</i>

55:11.442 --> 55:14.043
makes the one in LA
look like a flea.

55:14.111 --> 55:17.179
So we find her,

55:17.248 --> 55:19.181
<i>we root her out,</i>

55:19.250 --> 55:20.683
and we blow her up.

55:20.751 --> 55:21.817
<i>I'm no expert,</i>

55:21.886 --> 55:24.186
but the heat signature
on this one

55:24.255 --> 55:26.121
is like something
I've never seen before.

55:26.190 --> 55:27.156
<i>It worked once.</i>

55:27.224 --> 55:28.891
It'll work again.

55:28.959 --> 55:33.195
We strike hard,
we strike first,

55:33.264 --> 55:35.064
and we show no mercy.

55:35.132 --> 55:38.667
No, these aren't
like the ones in L.A.

55:38.736 --> 55:40.569
They're bigger.

55:40.638 --> 55:43.138
They're hotter.

55:43.207 --> 55:45.507
They're nastier.

55:45.576 --> 55:48.243
So what are you suggesting,
that we just,

55:48.312 --> 55:50.179
simply do nothing and move on?

55:50.247 --> 55:53.582
Suggesting you
don't piss it off.

55:53.651 --> 55:55.718
I don't want you
and your... your friends

55:55.786 --> 55:58.420
to do anything real stupid
like the last time.

55:58.489 --> 56:01.357
I don't have friends.

56:02.927 --> 56:04.193
I got family.

56:04.261 --> 56:07.262
<i>Well, I got bombs,
so you and your family</i>

56:07.331 --> 56:08.864
can just stay tight.

56:08.933 --> 56:10.566
<i>We'll check out your map.</i>

56:10.634 --> 56:12.601
We'll get a confirmation to you.

56:12.670 --> 56:14.236
Don't hang up on me.

56:23.147 --> 56:24.713
They want us to sit tight.

56:24.782 --> 56:27.916
Sit tight? How can anyone
sit tight right now?

56:27.985 --> 56:31.286
They're gonna get us all killed.

56:31.355 --> 56:34.857
Colton, this is the U.S.
military we're talking about.

56:34.925 --> 56:38.927
Kyle, you know I have
a problem with authority.

56:43.200 --> 56:50.139
Nobody, nobody knows
these spiders

56:47.104 --> 56:50.139
like I know these spiders.

56:52.376 --> 56:54.977
Colonel, thermal images are up.

57:00.351 --> 57:01.884
He's right.

57:01.952 --> 57:03.986
Whatever that is,
it's huge.

57:04.054 --> 57:08.056
That is the behemoth
of all spiders.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.925
Get CENTCOM on the line.

57:09.994 --> 57:11.627
We're gonna smoke her out.

57:11.695 --> 57:14.430
Then we're gonna
light her ass up.

57:16.634 --> 57:19.134
We're gonna light her ass up.

57:19.203 --> 57:20.736
What happened to the chopper?

57:20.805 --> 57:22.638
-We can't get to the chopper!
-Why not?

57:22.706 --> 57:23.906
Remember when I told you
that every time

57:23.974 --> 57:25.574
we split up, weird
stuff happens?

57:25.643 --> 57:26.642
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.510
Well, I was
on my way to the...

57:28.980 --> 57:31.146
-Right.
-And all of a sudden...

57:33.851 --> 57:35.918
And...

57:35.986 --> 57:39.354
-And then what?
-Marshmallows.

57:39.423 --> 57:41.190
So what do we do?

57:41.258 --> 57:42.925
Does anybody have a car?

57:42.993 --> 57:43.926
I do.

57:43.994 --> 57:45.694
-Brilliant!
-Go.

57:49.900 --> 57:52.134
I don't understand
why we can't just sit back

57:52.203 --> 57:53.669
and let the military
handle this.

57:53.737 --> 57:55.003
'Cause they don't know.

57:55.072 --> 57:56.605
And they don't know.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.640
You keep saying that.
What don't they know?

57:58.709 --> 58:01.310
They haven't ridden on the back of
one of these things like I have,

58:01.378 --> 58:02.544
And he has.

58:02.613 --> 58:04.012
And they haven't
looked in the eyes

58:04.081 --> 58:05.681
of one of these
things like I have.

58:05.749 --> 58:06.682
And he has.

58:08.385 --> 58:09.718
TJ...

58:11.689 --> 58:14.656
I think you made a wrong turn.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.158
Yo, yo, chill out.

58:16.227 --> 58:19.027
<i>This is my hood, a'ight?</i>

58:19.096 --> 58:20.195
We're dead.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.630
What's happening?!

58:21.699 --> 58:23.332
TJ, shut the hell
up, and get down!

58:24.869 --> 58:26.735
They're shooting at us!

58:26.804 --> 58:28.303
<i>They're not shooting at us.</i>

58:28.372 --> 58:29.471
<i>Let's go.</i>

58:30.775 --> 58:31.686
Get 'em!

58:33.877 --> 58:34.542
<i>Let's go!</i>

58:34.543 --> 58:36.695
-There's so many of 'em!
-No! No! No!

58:36.696 --> 58:38.647
-Are you Colton West?
-Damn skippy.

58:42.019 --> 58:43.118
"Red Rocket."

58:44.965 --> 58:46.132
Crazy movie, man.

58:46.133 --> 58:48.830
<i>Yeah. They should have
continued the franchise.</i>

58:50.978 --> 58:51.326
Look out, man!

58:51.395 --> 58:52.995
Come on!

58:53.063 --> 58:54.713
What are you doing
with my punk-ass brother?

58:54.714 --> 58:57.299
Who you calling punk-ass, man?
We over here saving Florida.

58:57.368 --> 58:59.868
'Bout to get medieval on y'all.

58:59.937 --> 59:01.470
Dad, get back
in the house, man!

59:01.539 --> 59:02.871
You two stand back.

59:02.940 --> 59:06.174
I'm gonna show you boys
how it's done.

59:16.587 --> 59:18.620
-What is that, sir?
-Fire retardant.

59:18.689 --> 59:21.223
Well, whatever the hell it is,
it chased them the hell away.

59:21.292 --> 59:23.058
-You have any more of it?
-I'm out.

59:23.127 --> 59:24.028
I'm out of ammo.

59:24.029 --> 59:25.660
Everybody back in the house.

59:25.661 --> 59:27.496
-All right. Come on.
-When they return...

59:27.565 --> 59:29.398
-Go in, Pops. Go in.
-They're gonna be pissed.

59:31.635 --> 59:33.168
<i>This is Delta One.</i>

59:33.237 --> 59:34.503
<i>Target is in sight.</i>

59:34.572 --> 59:36.805
<i>-We have missile lock.
-Copy that.</i>

59:36.874 --> 59:38.640
<i>Operation Alpha Foxtrot
is a full go.</i>

59:38.709 --> 59:39.641
<i>Roger that.</i>

59:39.710 --> 59:41.143
Let her have it, boys.

59:51.589 --> 59:52.888
We have direct hit, sir.

59:52.957 --> 59:56.024
Well, that should
wake her ass up?

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:03.732
Greetings.

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:14.509
It's... It's a nice night,
all things considering.

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:16.745
Yeah. It's all right.

01:00:19.249 --> 01:00:21.783
I loved "Straight
Out of Compton."

01:00:21.852 --> 01:00:23.051
What?

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:26.855
Yeah, I know he's busy,
busy destroying this entire city.

01:00:26.924 --> 01:00:29.858
He doesn't know
what he's dealing with.

01:00:29.927 --> 01:00:31.727
Now put him
on the damn phone.

01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:33.195
What do you want?

01:00:33.263 --> 01:00:35.764
The little spiders,
they don't matter.

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:38.867
It's the big one,
the gargantulantula.

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:40.869
You kill it, and
you kill 'em all.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.905
-Who's he talking to?
-Well, if it's that easy,

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:46.274
why don't you just
get some bug spray?

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:48.143
I've done this before.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:51.747
These lavalantulas, they're
not like the last ones,

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:55.384
and this big one,
it's got so much heat,

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:57.819
no weapon can come close to it.

01:00:57.888 --> 01:00:59.788
<i>-I'm about to prove you wrong.
-Really?</i>

01:01:01.492 --> 01:01:03.825
Who's hungry?

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:06.728
Really, Mom, who could
eat at a time like this?

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:09.898
A man's got to eat. Now shut your
mouth, and put some food in it

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.501
before I slap you upside
the head, damn boy!

01:01:12.569 --> 01:01:14.102
What's wrong with you?

01:01:14.171 --> 01:01:15.971
You don't question your
mama in front of guests.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.172
I was just saying
I wasn't hungry.

01:01:17.241 --> 01:01:18.173
Well, make your butt hungry.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:22.411
Lord, is this what it takes
for a mama to get her kids

01:01:22.479 --> 01:01:26.314
back in the house at the same time,
a damn lavalantula invasion?

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:27.849
Hell, if I'd have known that,

01:01:27.918 --> 01:01:29.899
I'd have called up them
lavalantulas years ago.

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.954
Woman, what's wrong with you?
You can't call no lavalantula.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:34.823
Don't tell me what
I can and can't do.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:38.660
I got Colton West up in my
house, a real movie star.

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.495
That's very kind of you, ma'am,
and completely accurate.

01:01:40.564 --> 01:01:41.596
Don't interrupt me,
movie star.

01:01:41.665 --> 01:01:43.699
You need to eat, too.

01:01:43.767 --> 01:01:44.933
Look skinnier than
you did 20 years ago

01:01:45.002 --> 01:01:46.968
in that "Crimson Flyer" movie.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.037
It's actually called
"Red Rocket,"

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:50.672
and it was a huge hit.

01:01:50.741 --> 01:01:52.107
That's the potatoes.

01:01:52.176 --> 01:01:54.643
Elizabeth, you know
them potatoes give me gas.

01:01:54.712 --> 01:01:57.646
You gonna eat some potatoes,
or I'm gonna make you wear 'em.

01:01:59.116 --> 01:02:02.150
Sir, can you tell me again

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:05.053
what was that material that you were
shooting out of your leaf blower?

01:02:05.122 --> 01:02:07.289
-Fire retardant?
-Really?

01:02:07.357 --> 01:02:08.690
Yeah, it's
ammonium phosphate.

01:02:08.759 --> 01:02:11.326
That's right.
Girl got a brain.

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:14.029
TJ, why can't you find
a girl like that?

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:15.664
What are you
talking about, Pops?

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:17.165
I do. She... She right here,
ain't she?

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.805
Hal, where do you
get that stuff?

01:02:23.874 --> 01:02:25.974
Pops used to work
for a fire department.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.342
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:02:27.411 --> 01:02:28.810
30 years.

01:02:28.879 --> 01:02:30.345
You know, I played
a psychologically

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.880
complicated fireman
with a drinking problem

01:02:31.949 --> 01:02:34.082
in the hit film, "Scorcher."

01:02:34.151 --> 01:02:36.218
I didn't really care
for that movie very much.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.519
Really?

01:02:37.588 --> 01:02:39.187
They should have consulted
a real fireman.

01:02:39.256 --> 01:02:43.058
And the fire, that computer-generated
crap, man, that just looked silly.

01:02:43.127 --> 01:02:44.159
Well, it's Hollywood, Hal.

01:02:44.228 --> 01:02:45.360
You know, I just read 'em.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:46.428
I don't write 'em.

01:02:46.497 --> 01:02:48.563
But, anyway,
do you have any more

01:02:48.632 --> 01:02:50.532
of that stuff down
at the station?

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.001
Hell if I know, man.
I ain't been to the station

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:54.770
since they cut
my damn pension.

01:02:54.838 --> 01:02:58.039
But I can tell you where they
got a load of it, though.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.040
Where?

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:01.777
At the airfield,
at the Forest Service.

01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:04.179
That's where we drop it out
of planes for forest fires.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.548
Know anybody who could
fly one of those planes?

01:03:06.617 --> 01:03:07.883
You're looking at him.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:11.720
First job I had when
I got out the Air Force.

01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:14.256
Really?

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:18.026
Colton, is there
something on your mind?

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:21.630
I'm thinking.

01:03:21.698 --> 01:03:25.133
Now, one of those planes, we'd
never get close enough to drop it.

01:03:25.202 --> 01:03:28.436
That big one, the heat
coming off of it,

01:03:28.505 --> 01:03:30.205
would explode
the plane immediately.

01:03:30.274 --> 01:03:32.240
Yeah, or if we even
try to get close,

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.276
she'll shoot that cilica
garbage or whatever that is,

01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.278
and we would fry.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:39.314
At the school, when we
were being attacked,

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:40.649
the spiders didn't see us.

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:42.551
She's right.
We got so cold in there.

01:03:42.619 --> 01:03:43.952
We lowered our body temperature

01:03:44.021 --> 01:03:45.987
enough that we were
invisible to them.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.289
Really?

01:03:49.193 --> 01:03:51.760
So have you got any guys

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:55.297
who could help us load
one of those planes?

01:03:55.365 --> 01:03:56.298
Not a problem.

01:03:56.366 --> 01:04:00.335
And have you got any guys
who can get us to that airfield?

01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:01.736
Not a problem.

01:04:01.805 --> 01:04:03.772
And how do you feel
about helping me

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:06.074
beat that thing and
saving this city?

01:04:06.143 --> 01:04:08.176
Not a problem.

01:04:08.245 --> 01:04:10.078
Good.

01:04:12.049 --> 01:04:14.416
Then let's extinguish the bitch.

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:20.689
Heavenly Father.

01:04:20.757 --> 01:04:22.123
-What?
-Breaking news.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:25.260
<i>Live pictures coming in
now from downtown Miami</i>

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:26.695
<i>-at Imagination Stadium.
-Damn.</i>

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:28.496
<i>We can now see
what the military</i>

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.932
<i>has been targeting
with those airstrikes.</i>

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:34.436
<i>My goodness.
It's a giant lavalantula.</i>

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.005
<i>The entire stadium
has been reduced to rubble.</i>

01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:49.885
Let's move out.

01:04:49.953 --> 01:04:53.889
Well, that sure as hell
ain't no itsy-bitsy spider.

01:04:53.957 --> 01:04:55.891
She's really big, sir.

01:04:57.427 --> 01:04:58.660
Blow her up.

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:00.829
<i>Target is live.
Proceed and destroy.</i>

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.732
<i>Roger that. All right, fellas,
you heard the man.</i>

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.567
<i>Let's go light her up.</i>

01:05:16.079 --> 01:05:17.412
Tommy's hit!
We're too close!

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.381
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:25.186
It's not working, sir!

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.588
Nothing is getting through!

01:05:35.332 --> 01:05:37.766
Gimme, gimme. I'm gonna
maintenance these.

01:05:37.834 --> 01:05:39.834
Thanks a lot.
Yes, yes.

01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:43.038
Colton!
Arni!

01:05:43.106 --> 01:05:45.073
What the hell are you
do... Zip it, Colton!

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:48.076
You were a pain in the ass when your
career was going in the toilet,

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.911
and you're a bigger
pain in the ass now!

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:51.579
That's what you risked
your life for to tell me?

01:05:51.648 --> 01:05:53.848
I know what you're up to.
Are you out of your mind?!

01:05:53.917 --> 01:05:55.050
No, I've never been clearer.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:56.284
I think I found
a higher calling.

01:05:56.353 --> 01:05:58.053
Higher calling, my ass.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.689
You want to waltz into cities
and save millions,

01:06:00.757 --> 01:06:02.223
you go through me.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.125
I'm your agent!

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.094
-You think Hollywood pays well?
-Yeah.

01:06:06.163 --> 01:06:08.263
Well, wait'll we hit up
Uncle Sam for your services.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:09.297
Really?

01:06:09.366 --> 01:06:10.799
Now you want to save a city...

01:06:10.867 --> 01:06:12.400
They go through me.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:13.802
And we're gonna make millions.

01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:15.203
-Millions? Millions.
-Millions! Millions!

01:06:15.272 --> 01:06:16.438
I gotta go save the world.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:17.906
All right.
I'm gonna make some calls.

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.140
That's my agent.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.608
-You came to me.
-Go get 'em!

01:06:20.677 --> 01:06:22.210
-Amazing! Came to me!
-Go get 'em!

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:23.979
All right, what's the
number for San Francisco?

01:06:25.716 --> 01:06:29.784
She can drop 90,000 gallons
of fire retardant on a target

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:32.287
before you can call
for more peanuts.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.457
That good enough for you?

01:06:35.525 --> 01:06:38.093
That'll be just fine.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:41.396
This is gonna be
a dangerous flight, Hal.

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:43.064
Man, I've flown
through stuff

01:06:43.133 --> 01:06:45.767
turn your butt whiter
than you already are.

01:06:45.836 --> 01:06:48.136
Ain't no spider
gonna take me down.

01:06:48.205 --> 01:06:52.407
This is not your average spider.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:54.909
That's great,
but in my world,

01:06:54.978 --> 01:06:58.179
if it's got eight legs,
it's a damn spider.

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:01.816
Now we gonna keep
wasting time talking,

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:04.486
or we gonna go ahead
and take her out?

01:07:06.356 --> 01:07:08.423
We're gonna take her out.

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:23.138
Sir, the missiles
can't get through.

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:25.273
Well, target the ground
near her feet.

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:27.375
Maybe she'll sweep the leg.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:30.278
We can't, sir. It's her heat
signature. Nothing's getting close.

01:07:30.347 --> 01:07:32.380
The missiles are detonating
before they can impact.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:34.482
Colton was right.
She's too hot.

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:36.951
Well, it's time
for an alternative.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.153
Alternative, sir?

01:07:38.221 --> 01:07:39.788
Get the President
on the horn.

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:42.690
We just may have to nuke my
little darlin' straight back to hell.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:45.393
Sir, if we do that,

01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:47.629
you'll destroy the entire state.

01:07:49.032 --> 01:07:50.265
Let's hope that's all.

01:07:54.905 --> 01:07:58.173
Good people of Florida,

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:00.742
your state has come under attack

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.945
from one of the worst menaces
known to modern history,

01:08:04.014 --> 01:08:05.380
a creature so heinous,

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:07.782
it can only come
from the pits of Hell,

01:08:07.851 --> 01:08:11.619
and if we don't stop it,
millions of people will die,

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:14.689
and your great city
will be reduced to ashes.

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.591
But not on my watch!

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.028
Do you know what people say
about the great state of Florida?

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.296
It's too humid.

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.131
Yeah, yeah, they
actually do say that.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:27.868
What does this Angeleno know
about the great state of Florida?

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:30.138
Florida is a state of winners!

01:08:30.207 --> 01:08:31.773
Can you tell me what NFL team

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:35.443
is the only team to be
undefeated in history?

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:36.810
-The Dolphins!
-The Dolphins!

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.613
That's right.
The Dolphins from '72.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:41.549
And where did the king,
LeBron James,

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.319
go to get his championship ring?

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.319
Cleveland!

01:08:45.388 --> 01:08:46.654
-Miami!
-Miami!

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:47.889
That's right, Miami.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:50.725
And which state has the
most beautiful beaches,

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.428
the hottest women,
the most golf courses?

01:08:53.497 --> 01:08:56.296
And the only state to have
no state income tax?

01:08:56.366 --> 01:08:58.133
Alaska!

01:08:58.201 --> 01:08:59.466
Nevada.

01:08:59.536 --> 01:09:01.603
-South Dakota's one.
-Yeah.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:02.804
It's true, but, Arni,

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.506
I'm trying to do
a hero thing here.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:05.506
You asked a question!

01:09:05.575 --> 01:09:06.741
I know, but give me a break!

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.912
When aliens come to visit,
which state do they choose?

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.113
Florida.

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:16.251
She's just kidding.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.953
There are no aliens in Florida.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:20.688
Okay.

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.490
I don't know
anything about aliens,

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:25.160
but I do know when
the United States of America

01:09:25.228 --> 01:09:28.830
sends a rocket into space,
they don't send it

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:31.099
from Oregon
or South Dakota or Nevada.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:32.100
They send it from...

01:09:32.169 --> 01:09:34.102
-Florida!
-Florida!

01:09:34.171 --> 01:09:36.104
I won this fight in Los Angeles,

01:09:36.173 --> 01:09:40.108
and fate has brought me
here to Florida,

01:09:40.176 --> 01:09:43.211
and together, there's
no way we're gonna lose.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:45.613
-Amen.
-Amen. Yeah.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.148
Tonight we win!

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.216
We win! We win!

01:09:49.286 --> 01:09:51.986
We win! We win!

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:55.823
-Yeah.
-That's right.

01:09:55.892 --> 01:09:56.858
-That's right.
-Yeah!

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:01.996
Can somebody help me down?

01:10:02.065 --> 01:10:03.331
I got you, buddy!
I got you.

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:04.699
-Thank you, Arni.
-Swing your leg down.

01:10:04.768 --> 01:10:06.134
I have to swing
my legs down.

01:10:06.203 --> 01:10:07.168
<i>Okay, then I go...
All right.</i>

01:10:07.237 --> 01:10:08.469
<i>1, 2, 3. Go!</i>

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.371
<i>Yo, Arni! My God!</i>

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.808
Colt, if the missiles can't get
close enough without detonating,

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:16.411
how are you gonna get close
enough in the plane?

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:18.346
I got this, sweetie.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:20.715
You just stay here
in the hangar.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.884
I'll be back.

01:10:25.288 --> 01:10:27.088
You better be back.

01:10:27.157 --> 01:10:29.390
Promise.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.692
Love you.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:32.026
<i>Get some coolant right here.</i>

01:10:34.297 --> 01:10:35.997
<i>Let's go ahead and mark it off.</i>

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.498
<i>Hey, we're all clear over here.</i>

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.610
...3, Philadelphia.

01:10:48.678 --> 01:10:50.678
300,000 for Allentown.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:52.914
-Hey, turn that up.
-Okay.

01:10:52.983 --> 01:10:54.249
<i>Continuing our live coverage now</i>

01:10:54.317 --> 01:10:56.384
<i>of this catastrophic event.</i>

01:10:56.453 --> 01:10:58.253
<i>Miami has been evacuated,</i>

01:10:58.321 --> 01:11:02.257
and the military continues
to pound this enormous beast

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:05.360
in what is now being called
"Arachnid Freedom."

01:11:05.428 --> 01:11:08.730
<i>Hal, how do we get close enough
to that thing without being seen?</i>

01:11:08.798 --> 01:11:11.599
If we take her high enough,
the plane will freeze.

01:11:11.668 --> 01:11:13.901
<i>Mr. West, stand by
for Colonel Jester.</i>

01:11:13.970 --> 01:11:14.902
<i>Colton!</i>

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:16.771
How's it going, Colonel?

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:19.140
I think you damn well know
how it's going, Mr. West.

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:21.743
Don't you worry. We got a
plan that'll save us all.

01:11:21.811 --> 01:11:24.779
-Well, we got our own plan.
-No, no, no.

01:11:24.848 --> 01:11:27.215
You cannot nuke Miami, sir.
That's insane.

01:11:27.284 --> 01:11:28.449
Well, who said
anything about that?

01:11:28.518 --> 01:11:29.484
<i>I've made that movie,</i>

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:31.619
and it always
ends with nukes.

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:33.621
You just can't do it. You
gotta trust me on this one.

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:37.425
Sir, we picked up a C-130 entering
the restricted no-fly zone.

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:40.461
Colton, is that you

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.463
<i>riding through a
restricted air zone?</i>

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.465
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

01:11:44.534 --> 01:11:46.601
I'm trying to tell you
we've got a plan,

01:11:46.670 --> 01:11:48.069
but you gotta
listen to me.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:50.338
I've got 90,000 gallons
of fire retardant

01:11:50.407 --> 01:11:51.806
that says I know
what I'm doing.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:55.343
<i>I love all your films, Colton,
but we're out of time</i>

01:11:55.412 --> 01:11:57.278
for any Hollywood
half-baked rewrites.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:11:59.447
Look, I took one
of these things out

01:11:59.516 --> 01:12:01.149
without the military
and without you,

01:12:01.217 --> 01:12:03.251
and I'll be damned
if I can't take another,

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.285
but I'm gonna need your he...

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:11.025
Holy...

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.597
<i>The repeated military attacks
on this enormous creature</i>

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.133
<i>are failing to have
their intended effect,</i>

01:12:19.202 --> 01:12:22.437
<i>but we understand new reports
are filtering in,</i>

01:12:22.505 --> 01:12:24.439
and you are
hearing this correctly,

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:27.342
that Colton West is
piloting a civilian aircraft

01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:28.676
into the hot zone.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.452
Pull up!

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.730
<i>Incoming!</i>

01:12:48.798 --> 01:12:50.565
Brace yourself.

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:52.400
Tail!

01:12:55.472 --> 01:12:57.538
<i>Marty, you guys
all right back there?</i>

01:12:57.607 --> 01:12:59.374
We're hit! I repeat,
we're hit, captain!

01:12:59.442 --> 01:13:01.042
How bad's the damage?

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:02.510
We're in a plane full of smoke!

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:04.045
How bad do you think it is?

01:13:04.114 --> 01:13:06.481
It's bad!
It's very, very bad!

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.383
Come on, Colton. No more
screwing around here.

01:13:08.451 --> 01:13:09.484
Just hold on.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.686
<i>I do not have time to hold on,</i>

01:13:11.755 --> 01:13:12.920
<i>and neither do you.</i>

01:13:12.989 --> 01:13:14.822
We gotta get higher.

01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:16.858
Right now, I'm just
hoping it stays together.

01:13:16.926 --> 01:13:18.493
If she sees us,
it won't matter.

01:13:18.561 --> 01:13:20.395
Colton...
Colonel, just trust me.

01:13:20.463 --> 01:13:22.163
Get your fighters in position,

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:24.065
-and wait for my mark.
-Colton!

01:13:24.134 --> 01:13:26.534
I don't think I could
take her any higher!

01:13:26.603 --> 01:13:27.769
Come on! Come on!

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:35.510
No! No, no! Man,
we're in a stall!

01:13:44.521 --> 01:13:47.789
Come on!

01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:49.924
He's so bad at this!

01:13:49.993 --> 01:13:52.093
Hey, what are you
doing up there?!

01:13:52.162 --> 01:13:54.395
Not good!
This is not good!

01:13:54.464 --> 01:13:55.696
-Come on!
-Colton,

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:57.698
your plane is
in a dead stall.

01:13:57.767 --> 01:14:00.468
I'm sorry, but it's time
for my plan now.

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:02.103
No! No nukes,
Colonel!

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:03.604
Don't count us out yet!

01:14:07.210 --> 01:14:09.110
Marty,
get the payload ready.

01:14:09.179 --> 01:14:11.412
Houston, we got
a damn problem.

01:14:11.481 --> 01:14:13.381
What?
He's right!

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:15.917
The drop mechanism
is malfunctioning.

01:14:15.985 --> 01:14:17.051
The bay doors won't open.

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:19.720
That's not good.
Not good?

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:21.055
Our odds of getting out
of this alive are...

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.490
Never tell me the odds!

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:25.059
You get this plane
out of a stall,

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:27.929
and, Hal, get the
bay doors open.

01:14:37.373 --> 01:14:39.607
They're headed
right for her, sir.

01:14:39.676 --> 01:14:43.578
That son of a bitch
is going kamikaze on us.

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.122
I've got the controls back!

01:14:56.192 --> 01:14:58.626
I'm coming home, Elizabeth!

01:14:58.695 --> 01:15:00.428
Hal, open the bay doors!

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:03.998
I can't. The mechanism
is still fried, man.

01:15:04.067 --> 01:15:05.533
You gotta cut the
hydraulic cables.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.935
What do you mean? You
can't drop the payload?

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.303
We have no power at all!

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:11.439
The only way this is
gonna work is manual.

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:13.641
We gotta do it manual,
or we all die, savvy?

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.376
But wait.
We gotta be closer.

01:15:15.445 --> 01:15:17.011
If we drop this now,
it's just gonna

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.046
disperse into nothing
over Florida.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:23.351
Then I'm going down with it.

01:15:28.591 --> 01:15:31.025
Kyle, cut the cable!

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:32.894
Okay.

01:15:36.399 --> 01:15:38.666
Hal, patch me
into the hanger.

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:39.667
All right, man.

01:15:39.736 --> 01:15:42.069
Raya!

01:15:42.138 --> 01:15:45.673
That red light in the sky,
that's for you, honey.

01:15:45.742 --> 01:15:49.010
You tell your mom and
Wyatt that I love 'em.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.244
Dad!

01:15:50.313 --> 01:15:51.345
I love you!

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:52.813
I love you!

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.884
Ahoy.

01:15:58.454 --> 01:16:02.156
Hey, Colton, are you
sure about this?

01:16:02.225 --> 01:16:04.325
Just like old times, Marty!

01:16:04.394 --> 01:16:05.860
Damn!

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.562
Let's go!

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:09.830
Go get 'em, baby!

01:16:11.734 --> 01:16:13.534
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:16:13.603 --> 01:16:15.937
Let's go!

01:16:27.450 --> 01:16:29.450
Colonel,
we're getting intel

01:16:29.519 --> 01:16:32.119
that Colton West is doing a
HALO drop into the hot zone.

01:16:32.188 --> 01:16:33.287
He what?

01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:41.529
Yippee-ki-yay,
gargantulantula!

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:54.375
Indiana Jones got
nothing over this guy.

01:16:54.444 --> 01:16:57.945
Spiders. I hate spiders.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:13.594
She's down.

01:17:13.663 --> 01:17:15.596
What the hell's
going on up there?

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.398
Colonel, hit her
with all you got.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:19.100
Who's this?

01:17:19.168 --> 01:17:20.101
Now!

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.938
Fire.

01:17:33.416 --> 01:17:34.915
Direct hit, sir.

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:35.916
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:17:39.589 --> 01:17:40.955
Target is destroyed.

01:17:41.024 --> 01:17:42.256
I repeat,
target is destroyed!

01:17:48.698 --> 01:17:49.964
Yeah!

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:51.298
Son of a bitch.

01:17:51.367 --> 01:17:52.633
He did it again.

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:53.634
Right on!

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:55.936
All right!

01:17:59.709 --> 01:18:01.308
<i>...talking about,
fellas. Good job.</i>

01:18:01.377 --> 01:18:03.044
What about West, sir?

01:18:13.389 --> 01:18:16.023
He couldn't possibly
have made it.

01:18:24.067 --> 01:18:24.999
Real good job.
Hey.

01:18:25.068 --> 01:18:26.567
Look.

01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:31.906
Good job, man.

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:19.687
Remember me?

01:19:21.324 --> 01:19:22.389
Come here.

01:19:25.027 --> 01:19:26.594
Where's my buddy?

01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:28.062
God!

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.630
Yeah.
Ho ho!

01:19:29.699 --> 01:19:31.031
Let me see here.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.032
Colonel.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:35.703
Colton West.

01:19:35.772 --> 01:19:38.405
Told you. We had a plan.

01:19:38.474 --> 01:19:39.607
Glad you made it.

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:41.408
Yeah, well, thankfully I did,

01:19:41.477 --> 01:19:45.412
but the gargantulantula,
she wasn't as lucky.

01:19:45.481 --> 01:19:47.481
She's terminated, all right.

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.283
It's a job well done, boy.

01:19:49.352 --> 01:19:50.885
Sorry I ever doubted you.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.720
You know what?

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:57.291
I'm gonna take my whole battalion
to see your next movie twice.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:58.759
Well, thank you, General.

01:19:58.828 --> 01:19:59.960
It's Colonel.
Whatever.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:09.403
My little girl.

01:20:09.472 --> 01:20:10.938
I love you, Dad.

01:20:11.007 --> 01:20:12.640
I love you, too.

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:14.241
Wait a minute.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.776
You called me Dad.

01:20:15.845 --> 01:20:18.813
That's the sweetest thing
you could say to me.

01:20:18.881 --> 01:20:21.482
Deal with it.
Gladly.

01:20:21.551 --> 01:20:24.351
And you cannot tell
your mom about any of this.

01:20:24.420 --> 01:20:26.353
Dad,
it's all over the news.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:28.656
I guess
she's used to it.

01:20:28.724 --> 01:20:30.457
Come here.

01:20:30.526 --> 01:20:32.159
Just remember, guys,

01:20:32.228 --> 01:20:35.763
it doesn't matter if you win
by an inch or a lavalandslide.

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:37.832
Winning is winning!

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.933
Yes!
