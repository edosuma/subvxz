00:01.102 --> 00:03.737
Welcome to "Everlasting."

00:03.838 --> 00:06.640
But one of the dates has
to be at my hotel site in Napa.

00:06.741 --> 00:07.941
Done, all right?

00:08.042 --> 00:09.776
Now just get back to work,
you limey prick.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.979
What if we backdoor
a spin-off for next season?

00:12.080 --> 00:13.380
We'll call it "Royal Love."

00:13.481 --> 00:15.282
You get him to marry
the Mexican bikini model,

00:15.383 --> 00:16.817
and you've got yourselves a deal.

00:16.918 --> 00:18.885
- Consider me signed.
- All right.

00:18.987 --> 00:21.822
I signed on for one season
of this. One season, that's it.

00:21.923 --> 00:23.257
I don't intend
to stick around for another.

00:23.358 --> 00:24.758
All right, let's say
I can turn him around.

00:24.859 --> 00:26.093
- What's in it for me?
- Wheeling and dealing?

00:26.194 --> 00:28.028
- What do you want?
- My own show.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.230
- Take "Royal Love."
- Cut a deal for the show,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.399
and you insist that they
shoot it at the vineyard

00:32.500 --> 00:34.835
as "Royal Renovations."

00:34.936 --> 00:37.037
- Pick Anna.
- It's actually not a bad idea.

00:37.138 --> 00:39.072
Anna, I know that you and I
have a connection.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.878
- Will you marry me?
- Yes, yes.

00:48.983 --> 00:51.151
- I broke up with Lizzie.
- You what?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.130
Are you leaving
before round two?

01:37.231 --> 01:39.132
Yeah. I... Jeremy... I...

01:39.233 --> 01:41.401
- Rachel...
- Oh, my God. This was a huge mistake.

01:57.185 --> 01:59.119
Hey. Hi.

01:59.220 --> 02:00.387
Hey.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.788
Hi.

02:01.889 --> 02:03.123
What happened to you?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.926
I...was with Quinn.

02:06.027 --> 02:08.362
Sorry.

02:08.463 --> 02:11.398
Let me take you home.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.633
Where, to your house?

02:13.735 --> 02:14.968
Yeah.

02:15.069 --> 02:20.073
Take a real shower,
sleep in an actual bed.

02:20.174 --> 02:22.843
I'm not asking you
to move in or anything.

02:22.944 --> 02:26.012
Just stop living like
a homeless person for a night.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.421
Hey.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.856
Where's the ring?

02:35.957 --> 02:38.392
Uh, I took it off, okay? I took it off.

02:38.493 --> 02:40.327
No, it's too big to wear at work, okay?

02:40.428 --> 02:42.662
- You got to wear the ring, baby.
- Shh. Shh.

02:42.764 --> 02:44.731
Tell the world you're worth
10 friggin' carats.

02:44.832 --> 02:46.333
This place turned out
really amazing.

02:46.434 --> 02:47.734
Thanks.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.137
You do this all yourself?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.405
Mostly, yeah.

02:51.506 --> 02:53.974
I guess it keeps me sane.

02:54.075 --> 02:55.675
Well, you're not that sane.

02:55.777 --> 02:59.212
You're... you're still with me.

02:59.313 --> 03:02.649
That's true.

03:04.852 --> 03:08.255
I have to take a shower.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.858
All right. All yours.

03:16.431 --> 03:18.732
Hey.

03:18.833 --> 03:20.967
Hey.

03:22.970 --> 03:26.273
It was right having you here.

03:26.374 --> 03:29.743
I love you, Rach.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.982
Me, too.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.584
Okay, all right, come on,
we got to be careful, all right?

03:38.585 --> 03:39.585
I got to get off.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.453
I got to get off.
No, no. No.

03:40.455 --> 03:42.322
I want to make a baby. Come on.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.857
Come on.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.393
You said you wanted
to make a baby. Come on.

03:47.895 --> 03:49.296
Okay. Okay.

03:49.397 --> 03:51.932
Yeah, go ahead.

04:02.174 --> 04:02.841
- Okay.
- Hey, baby.

04:02.843 --> 04:03.843
Hand me my phone, will you?

04:08.382 --> 04:10.817
Welcome back to "Everlasting."

04:10.918 --> 04:14.688
And here we are... the final
troika of lucky ladies,

04:14.910 --> 04:16.978
Anna, Grace, and Faith.

04:17.079 --> 04:18.478
It's so windy outside right now.

04:18.579 --> 04:20.848
This week, each one of our
final three contestants

04:20.949 --> 04:23.784
is gonna get a chance to enjoy
a solo date with Adam

04:23.885 --> 04:25.252
at his vineyard.

04:25.354 --> 04:27.288
Each one of these dates
is a chance to show Adam

04:27.389 --> 04:29.523
who is the best partner for him

04:29.625 --> 04:31.792
as he embarks on a year
of construction and overhaul,

04:31.893 --> 04:33.427
a journey that will be chronicled

04:33.528 --> 04:37.098
in our new show next season...
"Royal Renovations."

04:37.199 --> 04:40.468
Look at that... classy, elegant,
totally on-brand.

04:40.569 --> 04:42.370
That's us.

04:42.471 --> 04:44.205
- Super classy.
- But at the end of these dates,

04:44.306 --> 04:45.940
Adam will have to choose one lucky lady

04:46.041 --> 04:48.175
to spend a romantic night alone with.

04:48.276 --> 04:50.011
Because after this week, folks,

04:50.112 --> 04:52.146
we're down to our final two women,

04:52.247 --> 04:57.451
one of whom could be
the next Mrs. Adam Cromwell.

05:01.123 --> 05:05.191
- Hey, hey. How you feeling?
- Feeling good. I'm feeling really good.

05:05.192 --> 05:07.227
That's good, good, 'cause you got
a lot of work to do, you know?

05:07.228 --> 05:09.096
You got to get out there, and you got
to make sure everything's up to snuff.

05:09.097 --> 05:10.431
Dude, I know how to sell a location.

05:10.532 --> 05:12.133
That's good because I
want this vineyard to be

05:12.234 --> 05:14.968
the most enticing vacation
spot since God invented

05:14.969 --> 05:16.769
- the Fijis, okay?
- Sounds good to me.

05:16.770 --> 05:17.671
It's gonna be
an exciting year.

05:17.672 --> 05:18.572
- Hey. Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

05:18.573 --> 05:20.107
- Oh, hey, Rachel.
- Oh!

05:20.108 --> 05:21.242
Yeah.

05:21.343 --> 05:23.411
Um, are you okay covering all
the vineyard prep on your own?

05:23.512 --> 05:25.179
'Cause I got to go to L.A.

05:25.280 --> 05:26.914
Awesome. I'll go with you.

05:27.015 --> 05:28.749
I'll show you the house, and, you know,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.118
we can pick up fixtures
and tiles and that kind of crap.

05:31.219 --> 05:33.921
No, uh, actually, it's, uh,
it's a lady-doctor appointment

05:34.022 --> 05:36.689
- that I need to take.
- Oh. Wow.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.158
Listen, hey, about the baby thing...

05:38.159 --> 05:38.993
I wouldn't worry about that,

05:38.994 --> 05:40.995
because I knocked up my
ex-wife with hate sex.

05:41.096 --> 05:42.930
Imagine what I can do for you.

05:43.031 --> 05:45.433
Oh, I... I know what you
can do, believe me.

05:45.534 --> 05:47.234
Safe flight. I love you.

05:47.335 --> 05:49.036
You, too.

05:49.137 --> 05:51.839
Oh, hey, Madison.

05:51.940 --> 05:54.108
Chet tells me that you're
doing a great job,

05:54.209 --> 05:57.478
so just keep doing whatever
it is that you're doing.

06:04.228 --> 06:06.630
A year? And a whole another show?

06:06.731 --> 06:09.132
It's so exciting.

06:09.233 --> 06:11.568
I can't believe that they're just telling
us about it right now, right?

06:11.669 --> 06:13.904
I know. Shocker.

06:14.005 --> 06:17.906
Yeah. I just love demolition
and busting up walls.

06:17.907 --> 06:19.241
I just love that sort of thing.

06:19.242 --> 06:20.042
I bet you do.

06:20.044 --> 06:21.177
Well, she's not the only one.

06:21.279 --> 06:22.946
Faith, you're absolutely right.

06:23.047 --> 06:25.548
What Adam needs is a real partner in this,

06:25.649 --> 06:28.218
someone who'll really dig
their hands into the project.

06:28.319 --> 06:29.619
Not just some diva who'll go shopping

06:29.720 --> 06:31.288
and pick out swatches for him.

06:31.389 --> 06:32.689
Agreed.

06:32.790 --> 06:36.426
Adam needs a strong,
confident woman by his side.

06:36.527 --> 06:39.295
It'd be awful if he ended
up with some sad sack

06:39.296 --> 06:41.431
with a dead daddy
that can't keep her dinner down.

06:44.168 --> 06:45.969
You happy?

06:46.070 --> 06:47.537
Shut up.

06:47.638 --> 06:52.108
♪♪

06:52.209 --> 06:54.210
All right, bring it on down.

06:54.312 --> 06:57.647
Hey, so, I think we're gonna, um,

06:57.748 --> 07:00.150
start with the whole, uh,
horseback-riding thing.

07:00.251 --> 07:03.752
All right, so, I'm gonna need a truck
mount and a stabilized head.

07:03.753 --> 07:04.721
You can pull the one off the crane.

07:04.722 --> 07:06.523
That was official, like I
know what I'm doing.

07:06.624 --> 07:07.958
Sorry, uh, can I steal Rachel
for a second?

07:08.059 --> 07:10.459
Oh, um, we... we're actually

07:10.460 --> 07:11.761
kind of in the middle
of something right now.

07:11.762 --> 07:13.063
It's okay. I got it.

07:13.164 --> 07:17.267
Um, you guys do whatever
you need to do, okay?

07:17.368 --> 07:19.402
- Not cool.
- Come with me.

07:19.503 --> 07:21.538
All right, let's lift it up.

07:26.677 --> 07:28.445
Hey, let me undo a couple of buttons

07:28.546 --> 07:30.613
so when you're up on the horse,
we see a little bit...

07:30.614 --> 07:32.515
Oh, right, get those tits bouncing.

07:32.516 --> 07:35.085
- There you go. You've got it, girl.
- 'Cause I'm the sexy one, right?

07:35.186 --> 07:36.486
You certainly are. Come on.

07:36.587 --> 07:38.555
And you, caralho, are
getting absolutely nothing!

07:40.458 --> 07:43.959
- I signed a contract for that new show.
- Ow.

07:43.960 --> 07:45.195
I promised I'd marry Adam.

07:45.196 --> 07:48.698
And the crazy thing is,
I actually wanted to.

07:48.799 --> 07:51.634
- You still might.
- You said I had it guaranteed!

07:51.736 --> 07:54.470
And now I have to fight
with Anna over him?

07:54.572 --> 07:56.573
Well, that's kind of the premise
of the show, right?

07:56.574 --> 08:01.210
You signed a contract that gives us
the right to exercise your options.

08:01.211 --> 08:03.379
Well, screw your contract, and screw you.

08:03.381 --> 08:05.415
Hey, Grace, y... um, where you going?

08:05.647 --> 08:07.381
Adam, you know, I've
scouted this place, so...

08:07.482 --> 08:08.782
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay. I'm just saying.

08:08.884 --> 08:10.718
Well, just h-have another
look, 'cause th-this is...

08:10.819 --> 08:12.686
This is what made me
fall in love with the property.

08:12.787 --> 08:14.255
Okay, look, I am so sorry.

08:14.356 --> 08:16.390
I just needed to get you out of my system.

08:16.491 --> 08:17.691
But I am with Jeremy now.

08:17.792 --> 08:19.560
Really? You going back to that well?

08:19.661 --> 08:21.395
Yeah. I mean, you know,
he's a really good guy.

08:21.496 --> 08:23.097
And he's good for me.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.598
So you told him about us?

08:24.699 --> 08:26.033
What would I have told him?

08:26.134 --> 08:27.701
- It was nothing.
- Oh, really?

08:27.802 --> 08:31.104
You can keep telling yourself that,

08:31.105 --> 08:32.239
but we both know it's not true.

08:32.240 --> 08:35.275
And besides, you're the one
who keeps crawling into my bed.

08:35.275 --> 08:36.909
And the first time you did,

08:36.909 --> 08:37.544
all we did was talk about your...

08:37.546 --> 08:40.147
Your novel, and African AIDS
babies... saving them. And...

08:40.248 --> 08:42.048
I clearly have issues with my boundaries.

08:42.049 --> 08:43.350
I like your boundaries.

08:43.351 --> 08:44.418
I think they're great.

08:44.419 --> 08:48.055
But, Rachel, you were with Jeremy,

08:48.156 --> 08:49.490
and clearly, it wasn't enough.

08:49.591 --> 08:51.392
You need someone who you can run with,

08:51.493 --> 08:53.394
someone who's gonna push you to the edge.

08:53.495 --> 08:55.929
This isn't real. We're
living in a fairytale.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.064
I mean, we're on location.

08:57.165 --> 08:59.333
Exactly. This is all fake.

08:59.434 --> 09:03.337
It's... It's... Anna and
Grace... it's just fiction.

09:03.438 --> 09:10.344
With you and me, you know
we have something real.

09:10.445 --> 09:13.414
No, we don't.

09:13.515 --> 09:15.449
Really?

09:22.624 --> 09:26.158
That felt pretty real to me.

09:26.159 --> 09:28.595
Yeah, see, that's the thing
with you, Adam.

09:28.596 --> 09:30.264
It feels pretty real with everyone.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.509
Where are you going? 'Cause
we, uh, got the horses

09:38.510 --> 09:40.378
for like another three hours,
and we have a lot of setup.

09:40.479 --> 09:42.480
Uh... hey, Grace? Hey.

09:42.581 --> 09:45.882
Maddie, get Rachel, please. Rachel!

09:45.883 --> 09:47.084
Uh, would you
calm down, Grace?

09:47.085 --> 09:48.252
A-And, uh...

09:48.353 --> 09:49.487
Calm down?

09:49.588 --> 09:53.756
I am not just some slutty salsa dancer

09:53.757 --> 09:55.226
or whatever you see
when you look at me.

09:55.227 --> 09:57.962
I have other suitors, you know,

09:58.063 --> 10:01.098
who want me and desire me for who I am,

10:01.200 --> 10:03.401
not just for these or this.

10:05.304 --> 10:06.571
Hey, uh...

10:06.672 --> 10:08.306
Hey!

10:08.407 --> 10:11.908
- Where have you been?
- What did you do?

10:11.909 --> 10:12.944
Dealing with the women
is... that's your job!

10:12.945 --> 10:14.812
- Hey, I'm sorry.
- Hacked apart by the Tijuana Terminator.

10:14.913 --> 10:17.014
Tell me what happened.
Just tell me what happened.

10:17.115 --> 10:19.250
- What happened... she freaked out.
- What did you say to her?

10:19.351 --> 10:21.551
I was... was trying to sex things up...

10:21.652 --> 10:22.820
- Oh, my God, Chet.
- And she flipped out.

10:22.921 --> 10:24.155
She went completely loco,

10:24.256 --> 10:27.191
and you got to reel that crap in, okay?

10:27.292 --> 10:29.593
Uh, hey. Yes. Hi.

10:29.694 --> 10:32.162
This is, uh, Quinn King.

10:32.163 --> 10:34.632
Yeah, I... I'm just, uh,
confirming my appointment

10:34.633 --> 10:35.967
for this afternoon.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.834
Uh, yeah, I'll hold.

10:38.935 --> 10:40.269
Great.

10:40.370 --> 10:42.738
And can you please thank
him for fitting me in?

10:42.839 --> 10:44.873
Yes, well, I-it... it's very important.

10:44.975 --> 10:47.543
Otherwise, I... I wouldn't
coming down there.

10:47.644 --> 10:51.547
Okay. Yes, thank you.

10:51.648 --> 10:53.516
Grace, I'm sorry he's such an idiot.

10:53.617 --> 10:56.586
"Unbutton your shirt," he said,
like I'm a piece of meat.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.821
Listen, he's an idiot,
but I really think that

10:58.922 --> 11:00.756
that was just, like, his version
of trying to help you.

11:00.857 --> 11:02.191
Adam knows I'm hot.

11:02.292 --> 11:05.227
I have a brain and a heart.
He needs to see that.

11:05.328 --> 11:07.730
You know something?
It doesn't have to be either/or.

11:07.831 --> 11:10.666
I wouldn't shy away from the chemistry
that you have with Adam

11:10.767 --> 11:13.268
because that is a very important
part of a relationship.

11:13.370 --> 11:15.237
What happened to "sluts get cut"?

11:15.338 --> 11:18.707
And now that ice princess is pulling
into the lead, and I'm just...

11:18.776 --> 11:21.143
Grace, you guys have had
a connection since day one.

11:21.645 --> 11:23.679
Do you really think
that he wants some, like,

11:23.780 --> 11:24.947
delicate, little flower?

11:25.048 --> 11:27.415
Adam's a sensual guy.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.852
Seriously, you've got, like, a real shot

11:29.953 --> 11:32.655
at getting that proposal next week.

11:34.824 --> 11:36.058
The rigs go all the way down.

11:36.159 --> 11:37.292
I hope it doesn't rain.

11:37.394 --> 11:38.794
It's so muddy out there already.

11:38.895 --> 11:42.631
Oh, got it.

11:42.732 --> 11:44.800
Hey.

11:44.901 --> 11:46.669
- Hey.
- So, she's a little skittish.

11:46.770 --> 11:47.936
I just need you to, uh,

11:48.038 --> 11:49.738
remind her that she's the one, okay?

11:49.839 --> 11:52.608
- Is she?
- Well until you propose they're all the one.

11:52.709 --> 11:55.477
Is that really what you want? If
I go for her, I'm gonna get her.

11:55.578 --> 11:56.879
That's exactly what I want.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.313
All right.

12:00.884 --> 12:01.984
- Hi.
- Hey.

12:02.085 --> 12:03.919
So, uh, you ready?

12:04.020 --> 12:05.120
Yeah.

12:10.260 --> 12:12.527
Whew! Thank you.

12:20.837 --> 12:23.072
- Cheers.
- No problem.

12:24.641 --> 12:25.908
Looking forward to a wonderful day.

12:26.009 --> 12:27.976
Me, too.

12:28.078 --> 12:30.746
Rachel, hi. Um, I heard you were
having some trouble with Grace.

12:30.847 --> 12:32.214
Uh, no, she's fine.

12:32.315 --> 12:33.682
Oh.

12:33.783 --> 12:36.618
Well, what about you?
How are you doing?

12:36.720 --> 12:38.253
- All good.
- Anything else?

12:38.354 --> 12:40.689
No, thank you. Can we cut, please?

12:40.790 --> 12:42.691
And let's get those doubles on the horses.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.994
Copy that.

12:55.271 --> 12:59.541
Okay, let's get Adam on the rig A.S.A.P.

13:08.651 --> 13:10.786
I thought they rode.

13:10.887 --> 13:12.955
No. They don't.

13:14.324 --> 13:16.125
- Hey.
- Quinn!

13:16.226 --> 13:18.093
This is a surprise.

13:18.194 --> 13:20.162
- Pleasure.
- Oh, please.

13:20.263 --> 13:22.030
Trust me, the pleasure's all mine.

13:22.132 --> 13:23.232
Sit.

13:23.333 --> 13:25.734
So, a day trip to L.A.?

13:25.835 --> 13:28.036
You're either quitting or it's
bad news about the show.

13:28.138 --> 13:30.906
Well, I'm not quitting,
and the show's great.

13:31.007 --> 13:33.142
But... let's be honest.

13:33.243 --> 13:37.311
We both know that this franchise
is a dinosaur.

13:37.312 --> 13:39.214
You need to be looking
for your next big thing.

13:39.215 --> 13:42.584
Tell me something I don't yell at my
staff a thousand times a day.

13:42.685 --> 13:45.954
"Everlasting" was my idea.
I won that lawsuit.

13:46.055 --> 13:47.222
I know.

13:47.323 --> 13:49.892
And I have a million more ideas.

13:49.993 --> 13:52.294
Chet know you're here?

13:52.395 --> 13:54.062
Does that matter?

13:54.164 --> 13:58.033
If I stopped running my ideas by
Chet, that well would run dry.

13:58.134 --> 14:00.636
I want to cut out the middleman.

14:00.737 --> 14:02.104
Ballsy move, Quinn.

14:02.205 --> 14:05.306
What makes you think
I won't just pick up the phone,

14:05.307 --> 14:06.341
call Chet, and tell him what you're up to?

14:07.777 --> 14:10.546
Brad, everyone knows
that you need a new hit show

14:10.647 --> 14:12.981
more than you need a drinking buddy.

14:15.885 --> 14:18.253
All right.

14:18.654 --> 14:22.056
You get one shot. Get your ducks in a row.

14:22.057 --> 14:24.126
Call me when you're ready
to pitch your best ideas.

14:24.127 --> 14:28.362
Okay. Great.

14:28.463 --> 14:30.831
Thank you.

14:32.229 --> 14:34.330
One date down, two to go.

14:34.431 --> 14:36.299
But now it is Anna's turn.

14:36.400 --> 14:40.470
The stakes are high after
Adam and Grace's sizzling date.

14:40.571 --> 14:43.940
But will Anna rise to the occasion?

14:45.976 --> 14:47.743
Adam.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.246
So, I can just get the unauthorized
version of Anna Martin?

14:50.347 --> 14:52.248
Well, what do you want to know?

14:52.349 --> 14:55.251
I know you're a big-shot lawyer,
but what about fun?

14:55.352 --> 14:56.519
I don't know.

14:56.620 --> 14:59.555
I like, um... I like nerdy stuff.

14:59.656 --> 15:01.724
Like what?

15:01.825 --> 15:05.428
Like art galleries and books and theater.

15:05.529 --> 15:07.930
Does that count?
Well, of course it does.

15:09.600 --> 15:11.267
I think you'd love London.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.336
What, you don't see us
living here next year,

15:13.437 --> 15:14.537
renovating the vineyard?

15:14.638 --> 15:16.005
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:16.106 --> 15:17.940
No, I mean just once
that's all... all done.

15:18.041 --> 15:19.575
I like Paris in spring,

15:19.676 --> 15:21.444
and polo in Buenos Aires in the autumn.

15:21.545 --> 15:22.945
And Christmas,

15:23.046 --> 15:25.047
we're at my family's castle
in the Highlands.

15:25.148 --> 15:26.649
So, yeah.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.918
- That sounds perfect.
- Yeah, it can be,

15:29.019 --> 15:30.753
if you have the right
person to share it with.

15:30.854 --> 15:32.488
It's not all fun and games, though.

15:32.589 --> 15:34.457
I mean, the people need
to know that we care,

15:34.558 --> 15:36.292
so my wife would be expected
to do the Princess Di thing...

15:36.393 --> 15:38.728
Pick a charity and really
get behind a cause.

15:38.829 --> 15:40.496
Like the... The land mines?

15:40.597 --> 15:42.365
Yeah, or, I mean,
clean water, or...

15:42.466 --> 15:44.634
don't know, saving African AIDS babies,

15:44.735 --> 15:47.870
or fighting obesity... as long as it's
something that you really care about.

15:47.971 --> 15:49.705
Honestly, that would be, like...

15:51.074 --> 15:53.342
My dream, to be able to do that much good.

15:53.443 --> 15:55.011
That's all I want for you, Anna.

15:55.112 --> 15:56.812
You have to follow your dreams.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.452
Umbrella! Umbrella!

16:05.822 --> 16:08.724
♪♪

16:10.527 --> 16:14.764
Nice. Help her out.

16:14.865 --> 16:16.365
Come on, come on.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.606
- You... You all right?
- Yeah.

16:24.875 --> 16:26.409
Ha!

16:26.510 --> 16:28.410
That Anna's really something, huh?

16:28.411 --> 16:29.311
- Yeah.
- Ha!

16:30.781 --> 16:32.682
- You want?
- I'm good.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.984
All right.

16:46.597 --> 16:47.997
- Hi. Thank you.
- There you go.

16:48.098 --> 16:49.465
God, I look like a drowned rat, huh?

16:49.566 --> 16:51.434
I think you look like a mermaid.

16:51.535 --> 16:54.270
Oh, perfect. Very Darryl
Hannah 40 years ago.

16:54.371 --> 16:55.471
Ah.

16:55.572 --> 16:57.006
Looked like you guys were having fun.

16:57.107 --> 16:58.808
God, it was... I mean, he's everything.

16:58.909 --> 17:00.676
Can you imagine seeing the world with him

17:00.777 --> 17:02.278
and... And doing things

17:02.379 --> 17:04.614
that might actually change people's lives?

17:04.714 --> 17:05.815
Yeah, yeah.

17:05.915 --> 17:07.916
I mean, it sounds like a really, um,

17:08.018 --> 17:10.252
amazing life that he's offering you.

17:10.354 --> 17:11.621
- Right?
- Yeah.

17:11.722 --> 17:15.590
Rachel, this is gonna sound stupid, but...

17:15.692 --> 17:19.127
I think I'm actually falling for him.

17:20.931 --> 17:22.131
I know I am.

17:23.700 --> 17:26.435
Okay, well, we should get this on camera.

17:26.536 --> 17:28.804
Can you just... Am I being an idiot?

17:28.905 --> 17:31.874
Is he saying these things
to the other girls?

17:34.378 --> 17:35.845
Come on, you made a fool
of me once already.

17:35.946 --> 17:39.048
He's only saying this stuff to you.

17:52.062 --> 17:55.498
AIDS babies?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.986
Jeremy's scared 'cause he's
never played beer pong before.

18:17.087 --> 18:19.021
Is that why?

18:20.891 --> 18:22.024
Chug it, birthday boy!

18:22.125 --> 18:23.626
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:23.727 --> 18:25.928
- Hey. Hi.
- Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

18:26.029 --> 18:28.497
- Whoa. Hello.
- You noticed.

18:28.598 --> 18:29.899
Yeah, I did.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.835
Well, you invited me to a party,
so I figured, I'd...

18:32.936 --> 18:34.003
- I did.
- Hey, Jer.

18:34.104 --> 18:36.338
- Yeah?
- You remember meeting Penny, right?

18:36.440 --> 18:39.007
Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Penny... Penny was there

18:39.008 --> 18:39.642
the night that we all got tramp-stamped.

18:39.643 --> 18:41.010
Yeah!

18:41.111 --> 18:43.012
"We all got tramp-stamped"?

18:43.113 --> 18:45.848
You haven't seen theirs? She's seen mine.

18:45.949 --> 18:48.350
- Gunner, Jamie, come here!
- What?

18:48.452 --> 18:50.953
- Jamie! Let's go, buddy!
- Wait, have you seen this?

18:51.054 --> 18:52.521
Oh!
What have you done?

18:52.622 --> 18:53.889
Gunner, Jamie.

18:53.990 --> 18:55.491
- All right, gentlemen.
- Oh, no.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.593
- All right, gents. All right.
- Oh, my God.

18:57.694 --> 19:01.597
On the count of one half... present dogs.

19:01.698 --> 19:03.899
- Yeah!
- Aaah!

19:04.000 --> 19:05.601
I can't believe it!

19:05.702 --> 19:07.636
Ugh!

19:07.738 --> 19:09.505
Acid, right? Acid?

19:09.606 --> 19:11.841
Were you on acid? No, my dad just died,

19:11.942 --> 19:15.311
and this was Jeremy's idea
of how to make me feel better.

19:15.412 --> 19:16.779
Besides, my dad loved bulldogs.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.648
That's a Boston terrier, dude.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.016
Wait.

19:22.452 --> 19:23.819
I told you that.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.489
We were really drunk, and it did
take my mind off things,

19:26.590 --> 19:28.924
because this guy knows
how to look after us.

19:31.695 --> 19:33.395
Yes!

19:35.132 --> 19:37.266
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

19:40.837 --> 19:42.004
Yeah!

19:43.774 --> 19:44.974
I want to dance.

19:45.075 --> 19:47.643
Will you dancewith me?

19:47.744 --> 19:49.345
Yeah. You know, I have to say,

19:49.446 --> 19:51.280
your friends are very cool, very cool.

19:51.381 --> 19:53.315
- Yeah. I know. I know.
- I like them a lot.

19:53.416 --> 19:54.784
I know it's not Paris, but...

19:56.620 --> 19:58.387
It's just not like this for me
on the show, you know?

19:58.488 --> 19:59.655
Yeah, you don't say.

19:59.756 --> 20:01.423
So quit.

20:01.525 --> 20:02.992
Quit? Right.

20:03.093 --> 20:04.593
- We talked about this.
- Chet just made me a show owner.

20:04.694 --> 20:06.328
- I can't quit it.
- Who gives a shit?

20:06.429 --> 20:07.596
Rach, the only job on this set

20:07.697 --> 20:08.964
that's worse than yours is Quinn's.

20:09.065 --> 20:10.366
Do you really want her life?

20:10.467 --> 20:13.402
Let's get out.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.670
I can work anywhere.

20:14.771 --> 20:16.872
You know, we can go back to L.A.,

20:16.973 --> 20:19.308
have a real life and real friends.

20:24.548 --> 20:25.748
It's Chet.

20:25.849 --> 20:28.918
And you have to handle it.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.653
Apparently...

20:32.589 --> 20:34.557
No. You know what?

20:34.658 --> 20:36.091
- No.
- No way.

20:36.927 --> 20:38.027
Whoa.

20:38.128 --> 20:41.096
Everybody! She just burned Chet!

20:44.968 --> 20:46.669
- How did it feel?
- It felt good!

20:46.770 --> 20:48.804
- It felt really good?
- It felt really good, really good.

20:48.905 --> 20:50.272
- Uh-huh.
- It felt really good.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.791
- Umbrella!
- Hey, umbrella!

20:58.892 --> 21:00.259
Got it.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.594
Oh, God, great idea, Marin County, Chet.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.531
So, look at you... executive
producer actually producing.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.332
Little weirdo and I have
been having a blast.

21:07.434 --> 21:09.101
Hey, how'd everything go
at the lady doctor?

21:09.202 --> 21:10.302
Uh, great, great.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.271
Everything is, uh, right as rain.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.839
Pregnant?

21:13.940 --> 21:15.874
Yeah, Chet, 'cause that's how
it works... your super sperm

21:15.975 --> 21:18.243
jumping my fallopian tubes
in a single bound.

21:20.213 --> 21:21.747
Hey, Maddie!

21:21.848 --> 21:23.449
Hi. Hey. Wait, uh... Hey.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.218
Hey, uh, Madison, you know,
why don't we, uh,

21:26.319 --> 21:28.687
find somewhere where we can put these down?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.222
- Can you take those?
- Sure.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.523
Thanks so much.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.158
Um, why don't we take a little walk, okay?

21:33.259 --> 21:34.726
Look, I know what happened.

21:34.828 --> 21:36.695
Oh, my God, Quinn, I'm so sorry.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.330
This is not your fault.

21:38.431 --> 21:39.598
Did he force you?

21:39.699 --> 21:41.667
I-I... What do you want me to say?

21:41.768 --> 21:44.102
Well, I want you to tell me the truth.

21:44.204 --> 21:45.838
Well, Chet and I were just talking...

21:45.939 --> 21:47.639
You know, about work and stuff...

21:47.740 --> 21:49.508
And then one thing led to another,

21:49.609 --> 21:52.077
and his penis was just
right there, staring at me.

21:52.178 --> 21:54.146
All right,
whether you know it or not,

21:54.247 --> 21:55.614
Chet forced himself on you.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.815
That's what happened.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.484
But I didn't say no.

21:58.585 --> 22:00.719
Okay, I'm sorry. How old are you?

22:00.820 --> 22:02.454
19? Please.

22:02.555 --> 22:05.090
Your frontal lobe hasn't even
finished growing yet.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.758
This is why I never promote anyone

22:06.860 --> 22:09.361
under the age of 26, okay?

22:09.462 --> 22:11.129
This is what Chet does, all right?

22:11.231 --> 22:15.400
He did the same thing to
me a long time ago.

22:15.502 --> 22:17.536
You were just confused,

22:17.637 --> 22:20.439
and you didn't know how to say no.

22:20.540 --> 22:24.109
I mean, he is my boss.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.411
But, then again, you're my boss, too, so...

22:26.513 --> 22:29.448
So... So... So if I asked you
to go down on me right now,

22:29.549 --> 22:30.716
would you?

22:30.817 --> 22:32.317
No.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.354
I m... I mean, n... Well,
is that what this is about?

22:35.455 --> 22:37.356
No! All right?

22:37.457 --> 22:39.625
Oh, come on. Okay.

22:39.726 --> 22:43.128
I am gonna get you a lawyer, okay?

22:43.229 --> 22:46.231
I'm gonna help you, all right?

22:46.332 --> 22:47.833
And we are going to make Chet

22:47.934 --> 22:50.168
take responsibility for what he did.

22:51.437 --> 22:53.238
Good talk.

22:53.339 --> 22:55.073
But, Quinn...

22:55.174 --> 22:56.708
Oh, and get me some coffee.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.546
Ready to roll on
Faith's date. And action.

23:02.448 --> 23:03.549
Oh, my gosh! Come on.

23:03.650 --> 23:06.218
And...

23:06.319 --> 23:07.686
Oh, my gosh.

23:07.787 --> 23:09.755
Look at that.

23:09.856 --> 23:12.224
- What do you think it was?
- I don't know. Maybe a root cellar.

23:12.325 --> 23:14.426
- Make a nice tasting room.
- You know what?

23:14.527 --> 23:17.095
- I do believe you're right.
- I had no idea there was a secret room here.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.597
Right?

23:18.698 --> 23:22.401
Damned if a girl can't read a blueprint.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.303
And cut. Cut, guys. We got it.

23:24.404 --> 23:26.171
- That was great, honestly.
- Really?

23:26.272 --> 23:27.873
I feel like that was silly...
Sledgehammering a foam brick.

23:27.974 --> 23:30.242
Oh, no, no, no. I think it,
uh, looks good on TV.

23:30.343 --> 23:32.678
- Should we, uh, reset the wall?
- I think we got it.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.513
- Yeah?
- We're good.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.714
Okay. Thanks.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.349
Why don't you guys take a break

23:37.450 --> 23:39.651
while we, uh, set up the
very real hidden room?

23:39.752 --> 23:40.852
- Come on.
- Yeah, sure.

23:46.492 --> 23:48.260
Oh.

23:48.361 --> 23:49.561
- Hey.
- Hey, there.

23:49.662 --> 23:52.397
So, I'm thinking...

23:52.498 --> 23:53.732
Mm-hmm?

23:53.833 --> 23:57.302
I want to win this thing.

23:57.403 --> 23:59.471
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

23:59.572 --> 24:01.640
Faith, you and I,
w-w-w-w-we...

24:01.741 --> 24:03.542
- Yeah, ew.
- Yeah, I know that.

24:03.643 --> 24:05.677
Dang. That's... That's the point.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.346
I don't follow. I'm not... What...

24:07.447 --> 24:09.081
Okay, look. You and I
can fix up this vineyard.

24:09.182 --> 24:11.283
You saw... I'm real handy with this stuff.

24:11.384 --> 24:13.185
And Amy... She could come up here,

24:13.286 --> 24:15.253
and I could take her to San Francisco.

24:15.355 --> 24:18.590
And I could show her that
we don't have to be outcasts.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.225
That sounds like another
year of pretending.

24:20.326 --> 24:21.760
Dude.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.430
I don't know if anyone's told
you, but you are a player.

24:25.531 --> 24:28.600
If I drew a vagina on a white piece of
paper, you'd probably hit on it.

24:28.701 --> 24:30.235
Come on.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.505
I know you're not ready to get engaged...

24:33.606 --> 24:35.674
To either Anna or Grace.

24:35.775 --> 24:39.344
Come on, Adam. Pick me.

24:39.445 --> 24:40.812
You could get...

24:40.913 --> 24:43.315
You could get any girl
that you want on the side.

24:43.416 --> 24:45.751
Lord knows I won't give a hoot.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.552
Adam, this could be so good.

24:47.654 --> 24:50.422
So good for both of us.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.190
Well, can we find out

24:52.291 --> 24:54.359
if the last van's shown up yet from Napa?

24:54.460 --> 24:55.560
Can you just let me know?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.796
Faith wants to win.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.731
What? Oh, you?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.133
- Ugh.
- Yeah.

25:01.234 --> 25:02.467
- Mm.
- She's scared.

25:02.568 --> 25:04.569
She has this crazy idea that if I pick her,

25:04.671 --> 25:07.305
we can renovate the vineyard,
and then she and Amy...

25:07.407 --> 25:09.741
Can run away to San Francisco
and live happily ever after

25:09.842 --> 25:12.177
without telling anyone back home.

25:12.278 --> 25:14.246
She's losing her nerve, which, uh, I mean,

25:14.347 --> 25:16.548
you wouldn't be able to
relate to that, would you?

25:16.649 --> 25:18.316
Considering it?

25:18.418 --> 25:20.786
Okay, Rachel, you and I may have
screwed some things up...

25:20.887 --> 25:22.521
- Oh, you think?
- Okay, yeah. But...

25:22.622 --> 25:24.589
You know what? I can't. I can't
even get into this anymore.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.291
I can't deal with
all these other people's lives.

25:26.392 --> 25:27.592
It's just way too much for me.

25:27.694 --> 25:28.860
Dealing with other people's lives? What...

25:28.961 --> 25:30.328
It's not healthy for me. I'm sorry, Adam.

25:30.430 --> 25:31.596
This is a TV show, okay? This isn't real.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.432
- Yeah. I know.
- This is ending. Right?

25:33.533 --> 25:35.701
Well, it's not. We've got
another year of this.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.803
Well, no, actually.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.439
I'm thinking I may not even
do "Royal Renovations."

25:40.540 --> 25:41.840
- I just...
- What?

25:41.941 --> 25:45.608
- Yeah.
- You're the one who convinced me to do this.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.478
- Now you're gonna disappear?
- Listen, I told you to do it

25:46.479 --> 25:48.513
because I thought it was
something smart for you to do

25:48.614 --> 25:50.282
for your future,
and I still think that.

25:50.383 --> 25:51.516
- That...
- That's unbelievable.

25:51.617 --> 25:53.218
Will you get over yourself? Honestly.

25:53.793 --> 25:55.260
Okay, just pick Grace for the overnight,

25:55.361 --> 25:57.162
which I know you're dying
to do, and move on.

25:57.263 --> 25:58.964
So just give in to the inevitable,

25:59.065 --> 26:00.799
just pick sex over class 'cause
I'm just a shallow manwhore.

26:00.900 --> 26:02.568
Yeah, pretty much.

26:02.669 --> 26:04.937
Okay, you can pick Grace,
you can pick Anna.

26:05.038 --> 26:06.872
You just do whatever you want to do, okay?

26:06.973 --> 26:08.807
And then I will do whatever I want to do.

26:08.908 --> 26:10.576
And we know that those two things...

26:10.677 --> 26:12.644
They don't really run in the same universe.

26:19.118 --> 26:21.186
Oh, Rachel! Great.

26:21.287 --> 26:22.754
Come in. Have a seat.

26:22.855 --> 26:24.623
- What's that?
- Oh.

26:24.724 --> 26:26.124
That is a mess.

26:26.226 --> 26:31.063
But this... is eight years of
ideas I never told Chet about.

26:31.164 --> 26:34.733
- Hmm.
- I'm leaving him.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.235
What? What did he do?

26:36.336 --> 26:37.769
You have no idea.

26:37.870 --> 26:39.738
And I am handling it.

26:39.839 --> 26:42.808
But first, I need to set up my parachute

26:42.909 --> 26:45.010
before I can sling the ax.

26:45.111 --> 26:46.712
I'm sorry, what does that mean?

26:48.581 --> 26:54.019
I just realized that
I don't want to be with Chet.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.687
I want to be Chet.

26:55.788 --> 26:58.056
So I'm starting
my own company,

26:58.157 --> 26:59.758
and I want you
to come with me.

27:01.227 --> 27:02.694
Quinn.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.029
Oh, wow.

27:04.130 --> 27:06.131
I...don't even know what to say.

27:06.232 --> 27:07.633
Okay, but not as a minion.

27:07.734 --> 27:09.301
Not even a-a right-hand woman.

27:09.402 --> 27:11.603
Full partner.

27:11.704 --> 27:12.871
That's incredible.

27:12.972 --> 27:14.706
That's super incredible.

27:14.807 --> 27:17.209
And, um...

27:17.310 --> 27:19.645
Wow, yeah, I'm honored, but, um...

27:19.746 --> 27:21.313
But what? I mean, come on.

27:21.414 --> 27:24.082
We can make TV that really matters,

27:24.183 --> 27:27.152
that doesn't make people feel like needy,

27:27.253 --> 27:29.087
useless bags of flesh.

27:29.188 --> 27:32.557
It's just that Jeremy and I have
really started talking about...

27:32.659 --> 27:33.925
getting out.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.661
Jeremy?

27:37.430 --> 27:39.564
Yeah, he... We're just, like,
talking about, like,

27:39.666 --> 27:42.834
leaving the business, and...
I know, just, like starting new.

27:42.935 --> 27:44.202
So...

27:44.304 --> 27:46.071
Really?

27:47.974 --> 27:52.511
I'm sorry, your below-the-line,
coupon-cutting boyfriend

27:52.612 --> 27:54.780
is gonna offer you something
more interesting

27:54.881 --> 27:56.515
than a five-year deal with me?

27:56.616 --> 27:58.617
Quinn, he's a very nice guy,
and he loves me.

28:00.153 --> 28:02.621
I just think I should give it a chance.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.656
What are you gonna do?

28:04.757 --> 28:07.693
Go play house in his little log cabin?

28:07.794 --> 28:09.061
Write your novel?

28:09.162 --> 28:11.863
Go volunteer at women's shelters?

28:11.964 --> 28:14.099
- Please.
- Maybe.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.767
"Maybe," yeah. Go, then.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.703
You know what? Just go. Do it.

28:17.804 --> 28:19.871
Join the Peace Corps if you want,

28:19.972 --> 28:22.040
and see how that feels as your life.

28:22.141 --> 28:25.143
You know something? I just don't want to
be a woman whose whole life is this.

28:26.813 --> 28:28.547
You may want to be Chet,

28:28.648 --> 28:30.782
but I don't want to be you, Quinn.

28:33.252 --> 28:34.953
Yeah, you do.

28:36.349 --> 28:41.019
And here we are, where three become two.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.489
Adam. Have you made your decision?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.191
Yes, I have.

28:46.292 --> 28:49.728
Anna. Faith. Grace.

28:49.829 --> 28:53.198
I've really enjoyed getting
to know each of you.

28:53.299 --> 28:55.200
You are all remarkable women.

28:56.621 --> 28:59.690
And this has been a
very difficult decision for me.

28:59.791 --> 29:03.193
But...

29:03.294 --> 29:06.797
Faith, it's time for you to go home.

29:08.933 --> 29:11.568
I spent a long time trying
to imagine our life together

29:11.670 --> 29:14.371
and what an incredible year
at the vineyard we might have,

29:14.472 --> 29:16.540
but ultimately, I can't deny
the physical chemistry

29:16.641 --> 29:18.075
I have with the other women.

29:18.176 --> 29:21.111
'Cause they're women.

29:21.212 --> 29:25.616
And while I see you as a friend
and I always will, I...

29:25.717 --> 29:27.651
I don't think we're meant to marry.

29:37.495 --> 29:38.629
I'm sorry.

29:38.730 --> 29:41.298
Don't be.

29:41.399 --> 29:44.635
I understand.

29:46.404 --> 29:48.839
I want you to stay the course, okay?

29:48.940 --> 29:51.842
You are a wonderful person,

29:51.943 --> 29:54.545
and you definitely deserve to be happy.

29:54.646 --> 29:59.650
Whoever you choose, you choose
from your heart, okay?

29:59.751 --> 30:01.418
Yeah.

30:05.290 --> 30:07.658
Oh, come on, come on.
There's got to be something.

30:07.759 --> 30:09.660
Boring.

30:09.761 --> 30:12.196
Ugh, not this.

30:27.746 --> 30:30.814
And now it is time for your
next decision, Adam.

30:30.915 --> 30:33.383
Which one of these two lucky ladies

30:33.485 --> 30:35.786
will be spending the night with you?

30:35.887 --> 30:40.224
Well, um, some may find this
unexpected, but, um...

30:40.325 --> 30:42.826
Anna.

30:42.927 --> 30:44.528
Will you spend the evening
with me?

30:44.629 --> 30:46.630
Yes.

30:46.731 --> 30:49.099
Yes, of course.

30:49.200 --> 30:52.202
Who'd have thunk? Hope
he doesn't break her.

30:57.776 --> 30:58.876
- Hey, uh...
- Hey.

30:58.977 --> 31:00.444
Great job on the ceremony tonight.

31:00.545 --> 31:01.678
- It looked fantastic.
- Thank you.

31:01.780 --> 31:03.881
Now, uh, get your ass into your office,

31:03.982 --> 31:05.582
and bring your boyfriend.

31:05.683 --> 31:07.217
Jeremy?

31:07.318 --> 31:09.319
The other one.

31:13.458 --> 31:15.325
Shit.

31:17.662 --> 31:20.130
Hi.

31:20.231 --> 31:22.499
Um... you talk to the girls

31:22.600 --> 31:26.170
when they have a problem and stuff, right?

31:26.271 --> 31:27.371
I knew it. Grace.

31:27.472 --> 31:28.772
I saw her tear out of here

31:28.873 --> 31:30.641
with an entire Entenmann's cake and a fork.

31:30.742 --> 31:32.142
No, it's not... It's not Grace.

31:32.243 --> 31:33.477
She doesn't really want to talk about it.

31:33.578 --> 31:36.814
- But you do?
- No, not about Grace.

31:36.915 --> 31:38.215
- Um, I...
- Madison, what is it?

31:38.316 --> 31:41.251
Well... it's just... Quinn
wants me to say...

31:41.352 --> 31:44.221
that Chet forced me, but he didn't really,

31:44.322 --> 31:45.656
and honestly, it wasn't that big of a deal.

31:45.757 --> 31:47.157
It was just a small thing.

31:47.258 --> 31:48.625
You did something with Chet?

31:50.829 --> 31:52.529
What did you do?

31:52.630 --> 31:58.836
W-We were just hanging out,
and I gave him... you know.

32:00.672 --> 32:02.406
- Ah, I got it.
- Yeah.

32:02.507 --> 32:05.742
Um, I mean... I think
I was just really flattered

32:05.844 --> 32:08.745
because he was actually
interested in me,

32:08.847 --> 32:11.181
and nobody's ever interested in me.

32:11.282 --> 32:12.683
Oh, honey.

32:12.784 --> 32:16.353
But then Quinn started talking
about lawyers and suing Chet

32:16.454 --> 32:18.522
and... and wanting me
to testify.

32:18.623 --> 32:20.691
Is that something you want to do?

32:20.792 --> 32:21.892
I don't know.

32:21.993 --> 32:24.828
Quinn seems really upset about this.

32:24.929 --> 32:26.730
Quinn is a complicated person.

32:26.831 --> 32:28.632
What do you mean?

32:28.733 --> 32:31.935
Nobody here does anything to be nice.

32:33.504 --> 32:37.174
The quicker you learn that,
the longer you'll survive.

32:38.943 --> 32:42.579
Okay, but, I mean, Quinn
is gonna be really angry

32:42.680 --> 32:43.580
if I don't.

32:43.681 --> 32:45.582
Relax, honey. It's okay.

32:45.683 --> 32:49.286
I think there might be
another way to solve this.

32:53.491 --> 32:54.758
So, what are we doing here?

32:54.859 --> 32:58.262
Learning a lesson.

32:58.363 --> 33:02.599
Now, I'm assuming you threw
a towel or your sweatshirt

33:02.700 --> 33:07.170
or something over the camera,
but... just wait for it.

33:07.272 --> 33:09.740
Wait for it. And...

33:09.841 --> 33:12.776
Oh! There it is.

33:12.877 --> 33:16.880
Oh, aren't you two so great
at that together?

33:20.752 --> 33:23.220
- So...
- Quinn, that didn't mean anything.

33:23.321 --> 33:25.522
Oh, I don't care that it didn't
mean anything then.

33:25.623 --> 33:28.392
But it sure as hell means
something now, doesn't it?

33:29.527 --> 33:32.729
What it means is that you
are gonna come and work for me

33:32.830 --> 33:34.898
at my new company, no questions asked.

33:34.999 --> 33:37.701
And if you don't agree,
I'm gonna take that footage,

33:37.802 --> 33:40.504
and I'm gonna walk outside
and I'm gonna show it

33:40.605 --> 33:42.739
to sweet, little, old, faithful Jeremy,

33:42.840 --> 33:44.841
break his heart right there
on the mansion steps.

33:44.943 --> 33:47.444
- Quinn, come on.
- Oh, you know I'll do it.

33:47.545 --> 33:50.247
And you, Prince Charmless.

33:50.348 --> 33:53.383
You're gonna give me a wedding.

33:53.484 --> 33:55.852
I want an honest-to-God,
ring-on-the-finger,

33:55.954 --> 33:58.422
blood-on-the-sheets ratings bonanza.

33:58.523 --> 33:59.856
Not some fake proposal.

33:59.958 --> 34:01.658
And what if I say no?

34:01.759 --> 34:04.394
Then I leak the tape.

34:05.697 --> 34:07.197
Uh-oh.

34:07.298 --> 34:09.266
Your reputation-recovery plan
goes up in smoke,

34:09.367 --> 34:11.400
just like every other one of
your other crap business deals.

34:11.502 --> 34:13.270
You know what? Go ahead. Show it.

34:13.371 --> 34:15.405
Show the tape. I've been
a bad boy on TV before.

34:15.505 --> 34:16.606
I'll be a bad boy again.

34:16.708 --> 34:18.976
I don't care.

34:21.379 --> 34:25.716
Except that...

34:25.817 --> 34:28.652
you don't want to do that to sweet,

34:28.753 --> 34:31.554
little, old Rachel, now, do you?

34:34.292 --> 34:36.592
You are a hateful, conniving
bitch. You know that?

34:36.694 --> 34:38.228
Thank you.

34:39.630 --> 34:41.565
Now, go start planning
a honeymoon, lover.

34:47.371 --> 34:49.840
So, that is how you prove

34:49.940 --> 34:52.442
your undying love to Jeremy, huh?

34:52.543 --> 34:54.277
Don't ever lie to me like that again.

34:54.379 --> 34:55.478
Quinn, come on, okay?

34:55.580 --> 34:56.813
I don't belong to you. I...

34:56.914 --> 34:58.615
Look, you don't belong to anyone, Rachel.

34:58.716 --> 35:00.217
That's the problem.

35:00.318 --> 35:01.485
You clearly need somebody
with a strong hand

35:01.586 --> 35:03.220
to point you in the right direction.

35:03.321 --> 35:04.654
Oh, my God! Who do you think you are?

35:04.756 --> 35:05.856
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

35:05.957 --> 35:07.257
Who do you think you are?

35:07.358 --> 35:08.625
Who do you think you are?

35:08.726 --> 35:10.327
I mean, judging from this tape,

35:10.428 --> 35:12.596
you seem more like one
of our self-destructive,

35:12.697 --> 35:14.431
brainwashed contestants

35:14.532 --> 35:17.134
than somebody who knows
how to get what they want.

35:17.235 --> 35:19.202
Choice is yours.

35:19.303 --> 35:21.638
I mean, kind of.

35:21.739 --> 35:24.741
So, let me know what you want to do.

35:54.560 --> 35:56.361
Oh.

36:06.072 --> 36:07.472
Chet!

36:07.573 --> 36:08.940
You have a minute?

36:09.041 --> 36:10.775
Oh, for you, I've got
all the time in the world.

36:13.446 --> 36:15.814
Hey.

36:15.915 --> 36:17.716
I went to the urologist today.

36:17.817 --> 36:20.485
Guess who has the sperm count
of a 21-year-old?

36:20.586 --> 36:23.922
Did they have to pump Madison's
stomach to get the sample?

36:26.192 --> 36:30.462
'Cause you also have
a massive legal problem.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.864
Talk.

36:32.965 --> 36:34.900
Quinn wants Madison to charge you

36:35.001 --> 36:37.035
with sexual harassment and assault.

36:37.136 --> 36:38.570
Quinn?

36:38.671 --> 36:40.939
Madison came to me for counsel,

36:41.040 --> 36:44.676
so there might be an opportunity
to turn it around.

36:44.777 --> 36:47.345
In exchange for...?

36:47.446 --> 36:50.348
I want my own segments
working with the girls,

36:50.449 --> 36:53.018
helping them through their intimacy issues.

36:53.119 --> 36:56.388
People need to see what
these kids go through.

36:56.489 --> 36:57.589
Why?

36:57.690 --> 36:59.591
Well, it could also do some good.

36:59.692 --> 37:02.561
And I'm thinking if it all goes well,

37:02.662 --> 37:04.896
maybe we could talk spin-off.

37:04.997 --> 37:06.731
- Really?
- Why not?

37:06.832 --> 37:09.801
Dr. Phil was a nobody once, too.

37:11.070 --> 37:14.339
I'm tired of being ignored, made fun of,

37:14.440 --> 37:17.842
not to mention pressured
to do illegal shit.

37:33.359 --> 37:36.027
Rach.

37:36.128 --> 37:37.529
- Hey.
- Hey, babe.

37:37.630 --> 37:38.964
You ready to go?

37:39.065 --> 37:41.032
Yeah, I was just, uh,
finishing up some work.

37:41.133 --> 37:43.735
I think I'm just gonna stay
behind, get a ride with transpo.

37:43.836 --> 37:45.403
You starting to wig out?

37:45.504 --> 37:47.005
Is this 'cause you have some
trash bags over at my place?

37:47.106 --> 37:49.040
- No, no.
- Okay.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.442
All right. See you at home.

37:50.543 --> 37:51.643
- I'll see you there.
- See ya, babe.

37:51.744 --> 37:53.545
Bye, babe.

38:08.861 --> 38:10.528
What's going on?

38:10.630 --> 38:11.896
Shouldn't you be inside,

38:11.998 --> 38:14.633
making sweet love to your soon-to-be bride?

38:14.734 --> 38:17.369
You should talk. Shouldn't you be off
somewhere with the man of your dreams?

38:17.470 --> 38:20.338
I was just thinking about you.

38:20.439 --> 38:22.707
- Really?
- Yep.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.348
We're screwed, aren't we?

38:30.449 --> 38:32.917
Pretty much, unless you want Quinn to talk.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.320
No, I'm not gonna do that to you.

38:35.421 --> 38:37.856
Not if you really want to be with Jeremy.

38:37.957 --> 38:39.958
Oh, my God. Jeremy deserves
a lot better than this.

38:40.059 --> 38:41.726
That's your problem, right there.

38:41.827 --> 38:43.728
You don't believe that you
deserve better, but you do.

38:43.829 --> 38:46.731
You deserve everything.
You know that, right?

38:46.832 --> 38:50.301
Why is everybody telling me
what my problem is today?

38:50.304 --> 38:53.805
'Cause you clearly have one. Or many.

38:53.806 --> 38:56.307
Rachel,
I am tired.

38:56.409 --> 38:59.544
I am tired of pretending
that I can run from this.

39:01.113 --> 39:03.949
You're the one that I want. These
other girls are paper dolls.

39:03.950 --> 39:06.218
- That's just ridiculous.
- How is that ridiculous?

39:06.227 --> 39:08.261
You are the only woman here
who deserves that ring,

39:08.362 --> 39:10.530
- the "happily ever after."
- Okay.

39:10.631 --> 39:13.566
Or you can work yourself
into spinsterhood like Quinn.

39:13.667 --> 39:16.469
No, I mean, tha... That's not
gonna happen, either,

39:16.570 --> 39:18.171
'cause Jeremy and I...
We're leaving the show.

39:18.272 --> 39:19.639
Fine. That's fine by me,

39:19.740 --> 39:22.008
as long as you don't go
running off with Jeremy

39:22.109 --> 39:24.144
because he's the only person who asked.

39:26.113 --> 39:27.647
I'm asking.

39:27.748 --> 39:29.149
What?

39:29.250 --> 39:32.519
What are you asking me?

39:32.620 --> 39:35.622
Run away with me.

39:35.723 --> 39:40.160
Tonight. We can take a plane.

39:40.261 --> 39:41.528
We go to St. Tropez.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.164
We can lie on the beach,
neck-deep in Bellinis,

39:44.265 --> 39:46.032
until we're bored, and
then we'll figure it out.

39:46.133 --> 39:48.535
What are they gonna do?

39:48.636 --> 39:50.770
They gonna arrest us?
They gonna call the tabloids?

39:50.871 --> 39:53.106
Honestly, I don't care,
as long as I'm with you.

39:53.207 --> 39:55.775
Look, I know you care about Jeremy,

39:55.876 --> 39:58.211
and he is a nice guy, but honestly,

39:58.312 --> 40:00.713
how long until you're folding his laundry

40:00.815 --> 40:02.415
and wishing him dead?

40:04.418 --> 40:05.652
You're like me.

40:05.753 --> 40:08.354
You were not made for the ordinary life.

40:08.456 --> 40:12.525
I can offer you the world if you let me.

40:14.595 --> 40:17.130
So let me.
