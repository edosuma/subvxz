WEBVTT

01:43.186 --> 01:46.355
Oh, that's it! Spindle, taillight.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.575
Hey. Hey!

01:58.743 --> 02:01.245
-What?
-What do you mean, "what"?

02:01.412 --> 02:03.705
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

02:03.873 --> 02:07.584
Yeah, this is the sleeping chamber.
Go to sleep.

02:07.752 --> 02:09.544
Don't make me come up there!

02:09.711 --> 02:14.466
I'm so sorry, but I must have
the final ingredient for my potion.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.343
Now, what's more important:

02:16.511 --> 02:22.432
Me completing my life's work
for the salvation of the colony--

02:22.600 --> 02:24.393
Which includes you guys.

02:24.561 --> 02:26.728
--or your sleep?

02:26.896 --> 02:29.481
-Sleep. I'm going with sleep.
-Yeah, the second one.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.860
Well, then I shall try to be very quiet.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.778
Clacktiel.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.826
That's it, I'm coming up there!

02:42.412 --> 02:44.079
Fire crystals.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.458
At last. The final ingredient.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.132
I'm on vacation.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.721
-No. No, cut it out.
-Dogpile.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.764
Dogpile.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.604
It's the Destroyer!

03:14.444 --> 03:16.195
Atomic wedgy.

03:17.155 --> 03:18.572
And a clean break.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.949
-Clean break. Excellent wedge.
-Yeah. All right.

03:21.117 --> 03:23.785
Come on, man,
I'm running out of underwear.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.288
Well, what are you gonna do about it, huh?
Nothing.

03:26.456 --> 03:31.293
-Because I'm big and you're small.
-Yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:36.548
-Because he's big and you're small.
-Hey.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.426
Quit repeating everything I say.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.637
I was just adding emphasis, dude.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.556
Man, why you gotta be hating?

04:01.616 --> 04:02.741
Destroyer.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.089
Zoc?

04:19.132 --> 04:20.759
Water!

04:20.927 --> 04:23.011
-Zoc.
-Hova, please, get to the grass.

04:23.179 --> 04:24.554
It's dangerous up here.

04:24.722 --> 04:27.224
But I've always wanted to see
a human up close.

04:27.392 --> 04:29.726
I hear they're capable of speech, like us.

04:29.894 --> 04:32.562
They are nothing like us.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.321
What you gonna do about it, ants?
Nothing.

04:41.489 --> 04:45.033
Because I'm big and you're small.

04:45.201 --> 04:50.163
Away, monster, or I will use my powers
to destroy you.

04:53.501 --> 04:56.962
Powers that I have yet to perfect. Run!

05:05.221 --> 05:06.471
Hello.

05:06.639 --> 05:10.017
We mean you no harm.

05:10.184 --> 05:11.518
-Oh, great.
-Shoe!

05:11.686 --> 05:13.395
Shoe!

05:19.736 --> 05:23.071
-Please, go in peace.
-Look out!

05:27.410 --> 05:31.663
-Are you all right?
-I-- I guess he didn't hear me.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.583
Lucas.

05:34.751 --> 05:37.085
Peanut, it's time to come inside now.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.094
Peanut.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.264
I think I might have gotten through
to him.

05:49.432 --> 05:53.185
-What do you think?
-Destroyer.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.647
Tiffany, Lucas, we're leaving now.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.567
Lucas? All the numbers are on the fridge.

06:00.735 --> 06:04.279
-Good one. Extended play.
-Lucas.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.784
What are you doing back there?
Why didn't you answer?

06:09.285 --> 06:11.411
-Are you all right, sweetie?
-I'm fine.

06:11.579 --> 06:14.956
-I was just playing with my friends.
-I don't know.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.794
-Maybe we shouldn't go on vacation.
-Come on, it's our big wedding anniversary.

06:18.961 --> 06:20.712
We're going to Puerco Vallarta.

06:20.880 --> 06:25.634
And I gotta spend a little quality time
with the mamacita.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.804
Don't cancel your vacation
just because of me.

06:28.971 --> 06:32.974
-I can solve my own problems.
-Problems? What problems?

06:33.142 --> 06:36.144
Does it have anything to do with
why I can't find your underwear?

06:36.312 --> 06:37.521
No!

06:37.688 --> 06:40.649
Bed-wetting is nothing
to be ashamed of, Peanut.

06:40.817 --> 06:42.734
What? Just stop it, Mom!

06:42.902 --> 06:45.987
I don't have any problems
except for you treating me like a baby.

06:46.572 --> 06:49.574
-Peanut.
-And stop calling me that.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.369
Just go away and leave me alone.

06:56.999 --> 06:59.709
I, Zoc, call upon the elements:

06:59.877 --> 07:04.673
The wind that blows, rain that falls,
fire that burns.

07:04.841 --> 07:09.052
Deliver your awesome power
and transform my potion.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.971
Clacktiel.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.560
That was great, sweetie.

07:16.727 --> 07:20.230
I loved the smoke effects.
Didn't you, Spindle?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.149
You...

07:22.316 --> 07:24.192
...rock. Curse upon your children.

07:24.360 --> 07:26.987
I don't think rocks have children, honey.

07:28.114 --> 07:31.491
-They won't now.
-Okay. What's the matter?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.952
Hova, the potion is supposed to
change color.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.581
It's not changing color.
It's not changing color.

07:37.748 --> 07:40.041
I call upon the elements:
Wind, rain, et cetera.

07:40.209 --> 07:42.752
Transform my potion and clacktiel.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.049
Clacktiel, clacktiel....

07:49.218 --> 07:52.387
-Maybe you're pronouncing it wrong.
-How could I pronounce it wrong?

07:52.555 --> 07:55.724
-I made it up.
-Take a break.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.559
Hova, perhaps you didn't notice...

07:57.727 --> 08:01.730
...but we were almost squished today,
and the colony is in shambles.

08:01.898 --> 08:05.984
I am this close to finding a solution
to the human problem...

08:06.152 --> 08:08.737
...and you tell me I need to--
Hova, what are you doing?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.906
-Nothing, I'm not doing anything.
-No. Wait.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.908
-No.
-I'm simply walking towards you.

08:13.075 --> 08:15.327
-There's no reason to panic.
-Wait. Now, Hova--

08:15.495 --> 08:17.954
-I'm just coming towards you.
-Wait. No. Hova. No.

08:18.122 --> 08:20.415
Does it tickle?
What about when I do this?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.501
Why are you laughing?
I see you laughing.

08:22.668 --> 08:24.753
Don't make me clacktiel you.

08:24.921 --> 08:29.090
Well, I'm glad you two have something
to laugh about.

08:30.551 --> 08:32.760
-Head of Council.
-Hi.

08:32.929 --> 08:36.264
How nice of you to....
It was unexpected.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.100
Forgive me.
I was working on an experiment.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.436
Oh, yes, I see.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.190
Well, we were-- How may I be of service?

08:45.358 --> 08:48.610
Zoc, attacks from the Destroyer
grow more frequent.

08:48.778 --> 08:51.530
Our food supplies
are now desperately low.

08:51.697 --> 08:56.368
The council was hoping
perhaps you might have a solution.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.996
Fight back. We must stop the Destroyer.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.457
But thousands of ants
would needlessly die.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.378
Perhaps if we could communicate,
you know, just talk with the human.

09:06.546 --> 09:10.131
Oh, what a great idea.
Let's have a nice chat.

09:10.299 --> 09:13.593
Well, hello, Destroyer.
Gee, you look kind of tired.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.263
Why don't you just rest your feet
on my girlfriend.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.639
Okay, oka--

09:17.807 --> 09:20.308
Sometimes you're a real stinkbug,
you know that?

09:20.476 --> 09:25.647
Zoc, a war with the human is--
It's impossible.

09:25.815 --> 09:30.277
A wizard knows no such word.

09:34.657 --> 09:38.034
-Whatever.
-Bye, Tiff. Bye, Lucas.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.620
I love you.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.583
You kids mind your grandma.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.002
Okay, goodbye. Have fun.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.380
Don't worry, everything's under control.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.637
A little help, please.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.390
I think it's your turn.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.517
Teeth in the grass.

10:03.894 --> 10:07.939
Mommo, here's your--
What are you doing?

10:08.107 --> 10:12.193
Preventing alien abduction,
that's what I'm doing.

10:12.361 --> 10:14.362
Thank you.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.283
Dang crabgrass.

10:18.451 --> 10:22.871
See these? Airflow. Aliens hate airflow.

10:23.623 --> 10:28.251
Drives them nuts. And if they try to cut
the power in the middle of the night...

10:30.379 --> 10:32.964
...these babies will wake me up.

10:33.132 --> 10:37.302
-We gotta be prepared. Tell your friends.
-I don't have any friends.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.929
Well, who's gonna look out for you
when you get old...

10:40.097 --> 10:44.100
...and your teeth are falling out,
and them aliens are after you?

10:44.268 --> 10:47.896
-Lucas.
-I'll look after myself.

10:49.398 --> 10:52.484
-Good night, Mommo.
-Good night. Sleep tight.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.694
Don't let the bedbugs bite...

10:54.862 --> 10:58.073
...or creep into your ear
and lay eggs in your brain.

11:12.838 --> 11:16.424
-Dance, Pukas.
-Dance, monkey boy, dance!

11:17.009 --> 11:18.760
Think fast.

11:40.658 --> 11:42.367
Clacktiel.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.414
You....

11:47.581 --> 11:50.250
Zoc, please, not in front of Spindle.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.211
Sorry.

11:54.255 --> 11:57.966
God, there must be something I missed.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.301
Wait. A crack.

12:00.469 --> 12:03.555
That's it. Imperfections in the crystals.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.641
Perhaps coating it
in a viscous compound.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.768
Spindle. Resin.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.486
Clacktiel.

12:23.784 --> 12:28.496
Oh, that's it. It worked!
The potion is complete!

12:29.039 --> 12:33.793
Praise the Mother! Yes! Yes! Yes!

12:33.961 --> 12:35.378
No!

12:37.339 --> 12:40.341
-Zoc.
-Hova, hang on.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.304
Spindle, get the potion. Quickly.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.419
Hello.

13:17.797 --> 13:23.218
Yep, I was about your age
when I flooded my first colony.

13:23.552 --> 13:27.972
Brother, those were good times.
Good times!

13:29.141 --> 13:32.393
-Who are you?
-Stan Beals is the name.

13:32.561 --> 13:34.229
Beals-A-Bug Pest Control.

13:35.815 --> 13:38.525
Exterminator, eradicator,
solver of problems.

13:38.692 --> 13:41.402
Hey, you must be the Nickle boy, right?

13:41.570 --> 13:43.571
Now, your dad ordered my services...

13:43.739 --> 13:46.407
...but he forgot to sign the contract
before he left.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.536
Busy man. Lot on his mind. It happens.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.747
So he just told me to talk to you....

13:52.998 --> 13:55.917
-Lucas.
-Yeah, Lucas.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.838
He said, "You have my son, Lucas,
sign the contract for me...

14:00.005 --> 14:04.050
...if I happen to forget to before I leave.
He's a grown man now."

14:04.218 --> 14:06.219
His exact words.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.265
I don't know.
Do you have any references?

14:10.933 --> 14:12.851
References?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.769
There's one.

14:16.647 --> 14:18.940
I don't think I should.

14:19.984 --> 14:24.153
You don't think you should, huh?
You don't think?

14:24.321 --> 14:27.866
So who does your thinking for you?
Your mommy?

14:28.033 --> 14:30.493
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,
what do I do?

14:30.661 --> 14:33.538
I'm just a little baby
that can't think for myself.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.456
Please wipe my little bottom for me.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.752
Wipe me. Oh, oh, please, wipe me.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.966
-Give me that stupid contract.
-Yes, sir. A very mature decision.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.552
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

14:47.720 --> 14:51.764
Just sign right here
And leave the killing to me

14:51.932 --> 14:53.850
I wrote that.

15:08.365 --> 15:10.909
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

15:11.076 --> 15:14.120
Spindle? Spindle?

15:15.497 --> 15:18.458
Spindle. You saved it.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.793
Oh, well, come here.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.963
Well, someone's getting
an extra moldy root tonight.

15:24.131 --> 15:26.257
-Okay, okay.
-Zoc.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.346
Spindle, light.

15:38.354 --> 15:41.522
-Mother, help us.
-Oh, no.

15:41.690 --> 15:45.443
To attack without provocation,
without reason...

15:45.611 --> 15:49.822
...just because they can, it's--
It's barbaric.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.992
But what can we do?

15:53.452 --> 15:55.703
We are lost.

15:56.205 --> 15:59.207
No. We are saved.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.543
This is our salvation.

16:02.711 --> 16:04.837
A potion?

16:05.005 --> 16:09.550
What exactly does it do?

17:41.518 --> 17:42.810
Hey. Hey, hey.

18:02.289 --> 18:05.625
Human. Come with us.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.633
Shoo. Shoo. Get away. Get away.

18:13.801 --> 18:16.928
I got a fan. I'm windy.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.597
I am windy.

18:23.519 --> 18:32.276
Hello?

18:34.488 --> 18:38.032
Scanning. Scanning. Scanning.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.827
Stop! Hey, come on! Cut it out!

18:40.994 --> 18:44.539
What are you doing out of bed,
tiny Lucas?

18:55.217 --> 18:58.052
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

19:26.373 --> 19:28.916
Gross. Hey, cut it out.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.936
Put me down! Hey. Stop. Put me down.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.276
Put me down!

20:01.241 --> 20:02.909
What is that? Oh, he smells.

20:03.076 --> 20:06.454
-It's the human.
-It's Peanut, the Destroyer.

20:08.749 --> 20:10.625
Oh, my.

20:10.792 --> 20:13.920
-All right, Peanut, this way.
-It's small.

20:14.087 --> 20:15.463
-What is it?
-Touch it.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.631
-Don't touch it.
-Hey.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.759
-Poke it.
-He's so soft.

20:19.927 --> 20:24.305
-His skeleton is on the inside.
-He's inside out?

20:31.146 --> 20:33.898
Where are you taking me? Help!

20:35.776 --> 20:38.819
Who are you? What did you do to me?
Let me go!

20:41.573 --> 20:42.823
Human...

20:43.617 --> 20:46.577
...you have been brought
before the council...

20:46.745 --> 20:50.539
...to face judgment
for crimes against the colony.

20:50.707 --> 20:51.999
Read the charges.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.086
"This human-destructor beast...

20:55.254 --> 20:58.589
...hereafter referred to
as Peanut the Destroyer...

20:58.757 --> 21:01.467
...did willfully
and with malice aforethought...

21:01.635 --> 21:04.303
...crush the food-storage chambers...

21:04.471 --> 21:06.847
...flood all of the lower
hatching chambers...

21:07.015 --> 21:12.645
...and douse the colony
with the dreaded yellow rain."

21:12.813 --> 21:14.855
Hey, come on, I had to go.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.485
Sentencing of the human
will be handed down...

21:19.653 --> 21:22.321
...by the queen herself.

21:31.331 --> 21:35.126
Greetings, my children...

21:35.294 --> 21:39.672
...and to our unusual guest...

21:39.840 --> 21:45.094
...a human that threatens
the very existence of our colony.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.222
Wait a second! Wait, wait, wait.
Time out.

21:48.390 --> 21:52.643
How was I supposed to know
ants had feelings or families or trials?

21:52.811 --> 21:56.564
-You're just a bunch of stupid ants.
-Destroy the Destroyer!

21:56.732 --> 21:59.317
-Throw him in the pit.
-Let's eat him!

21:59.484 --> 22:03.237
No, wait. We are not mindless savages.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.531
This human should be studied.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.283
-And then we'll eat him.
-Yeah.

22:07.451 --> 22:10.494
Eat! Eat! Eat!

22:10.912 --> 22:13.497
Order. Order.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.083
Be still, be still.

22:16.251 --> 22:19.879
Tonight we have a choice.

22:20.047 --> 22:25.426
We could destroy this human
and make safe this day.

22:25.594 --> 22:30.389
Or we could change
the nature of this human...

22:30.557 --> 22:36.228
...and perhaps create
a brighter future for all ants.

22:36.396 --> 22:41.484
I therefore sentence the human
to live and work in the colony...

22:41.651 --> 22:46.781
...to learn our ways.
He must become an ant.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.910
-What?
-No. No, my queen.

22:51.328 --> 22:55.456
What if he does not become an ant?

22:55.624 --> 22:57.958
Okay, I mean, come on.

22:58.335 --> 23:00.961
That would be regrettable.

23:01.880 --> 23:04.965
But-- But who will teach him our ways?

23:06.093 --> 23:08.594
-I will.
-Hova?

23:08.762 --> 23:10.221
It is done.

23:10.389 --> 23:13.474
Let us continue our work.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.228
That's it?
How long am I gonna be like this?

23:17.396 --> 23:18.646
I wanna go home.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.606
Wait. This is inhuman.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.235
Yes, it is.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.323
Hello, Peanut?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.159
Destroyer?

23:32.536 --> 23:34.912
Hello? We have to go.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.998
It's time to start your training.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.835
Where are you?

23:45.340 --> 23:46.465
Okay, okay. It's simple.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.677
All I have to do is run past the guards,
then escape the anthill...

23:49.845 --> 23:52.847
-...and not get eaten by anything.
-Well, hello there.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.349
You know, there's a million things
I wanna ask you.

23:55.517 --> 23:58.519
When were you hatched?
Are you--? Are you male or female?

23:59.062 --> 24:00.688
And how do you tell the difference?

24:00.856 --> 24:03.691
Is it--? Oh, is that how?

24:03.859 --> 24:08.154
Hey, stop peeking.
Or-- Or I'll stomp on you.

24:08.321 --> 24:12.074
Well, I wouldn't if I were you.
You see, I'm the only friend you've got.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.367
You're gonna eat me.

24:13.785 --> 24:17.037
You know, now that you mention it,
you do look soft and chewy...

24:17.205 --> 24:19.665
...but I promised the queen I wouldn't.

24:21.084 --> 24:22.334
Cross your heart.

24:22.502 --> 24:24.128
What? Oh, all right.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.297
Cross my heart, I will not eat you.

24:27.048 --> 24:29.216
I said, cross your heart, not your butt.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.218
I just did.

24:31.386 --> 24:33.596
See, there, did it again.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.014
Strange custom.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.891
I'm still not going.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.977
-Peanut, you need to--
-My name's Lucas, not Peanut.

24:40.145 --> 24:41.896
Lucas.

24:42.063 --> 24:45.065
Well, Lucas. You heard the queen.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.943
You must become an ant
if you ever want to return home.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.070
And how am I supposed to do that?

24:50.238 --> 24:52.740
Well, you just have
to find your place in the colony.

25:03.168 --> 25:06.754
So, Lucas,
do you have any special skills?

25:06.922 --> 25:09.423
I can make milk come out
of my sister's nose.

25:09.591 --> 25:13.385
Okay, well, let's try foraging.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.554
The instructor
is a personal friend of mine.

25:15.722 --> 25:17.848
I'm sure she'd love to help.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.226
Peanut? The Destroyer?

25:20.393 --> 25:22.520
I had to move out
of my nest because of you.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.271
I lost everything.

25:24.439 --> 25:26.732
Took me all morning to rebuild.

25:26.900 --> 25:31.570
Hova, don't tell me
that you are mentoring this-- This-- This....

25:32.113 --> 25:33.864
It's Lucas.

25:35.784 --> 25:39.203
Why is he covered in trash? Is he crazy?
Because I don't teach crazy ants.

25:39.371 --> 25:42.915
No, no, no. He calls the trash "clothes."

25:43.083 --> 25:45.125
They like keeping
their gender traits hidden.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.962
He's male.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.882
Okay, Lucas, you're on the blue team.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.717
-Oh, man. That's not fair.
-Come on.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.928
Hey, hey, hey, quiet.

25:56.096 --> 25:58.722
And suck in that thorax.

25:58.890 --> 26:03.227
Like everything in the colony,
foraging is a team effort.

26:03.395 --> 26:09.441
In this test, each team must act
as a single unit to avoid obstacles...

26:09.609 --> 26:13.320
...retrieve the sweet rock
and return to the nest.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.574
No ant gets left behind.

26:16.741 --> 26:18.325
First team back wins.

26:18.493 --> 26:20.494
Any questions?

26:24.541 --> 26:27.167
-Hello, baby.
-Fugax.

26:27.335 --> 26:31.338
Well, isn't it true that scout ants,
such as myself...

26:31.506 --> 26:35.968
...lead an exciting life of adventure
and intrigue.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.930
-Fugax!
-While foragers, such as you...

26:40.098 --> 26:43.309
...just walk around and pick up sticks.

26:45.687 --> 26:46.937
Questions, anyone?

26:47.105 --> 26:49.273
-Oh, sir?
-The guy with the crooked mandibles.

26:49.441 --> 26:50.983
What kind of adventures?

26:51.151 --> 26:53.527
Well, I'm glad you asked.

26:53.695 --> 26:57.072
-Fugax.
-Gather round, young scouts.

26:57.240 --> 27:02.786
In my travels, I have journeyed
far beyond the great flat rock.

27:04.289 --> 27:05.873
You mean, the street?

27:06.374 --> 27:09.168
No. The great flat rock...

27:09.336 --> 27:14.381
...where the humans
ride in their giant metal cocoons.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.050
Cars.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.177
Did I call on you?

27:18.345 --> 27:20.596
Who invited Captain Party Pooper?

27:20.764 --> 27:22.640
Fugax, meet the Destroyer.

27:22.807 --> 27:24.224
Destroyer?

27:31.483 --> 27:34.485
Now, are there any other--?

27:36.696 --> 27:40.032
Are there any other questions
about your assignment?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.077
Yeah, what's a sweet rock?

27:43.244 --> 27:44.745
Go.

27:51.503 --> 27:52.961
-Bridge.
-Stack up.

27:53.129 --> 27:54.588
Bridge, hooyah.

27:54.756 --> 27:55.964
Come on, Peanut.

27:56.132 --> 27:59.259
Hello, I can do it myself.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.516
Hey, guys. I think he's dead.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.060
I'm not dead.

28:08.436 --> 28:10.854
-Ladder.
-Ladder, hooyah.

28:11.272 --> 28:13.607
-Come on.
-Grab hold.

28:13.775 --> 28:15.734
I don't need your help.

28:15.902 --> 28:17.945
I need your help! I need your help!

28:18.113 --> 28:20.322
Bye, losers.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.658
Come on.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.996
-All right.
-Hurry, human.

28:28.164 --> 28:29.373
You're gonna make us lose.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.792
Hey. I've only got two legs.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.129
Go, Two Legs, go.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.588
Go, Lucas.

28:36.756 --> 28:39.049
-Spring.
-Spring, hooyah.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.135
Hooyah.

28:42.637 --> 28:44.638
Oh, time out.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.724
I don't think I can do this--

28:46.891 --> 28:48.058
All right.

28:50.311 --> 28:53.397
-Let me off!
-Don't let go!

28:53.815 --> 28:55.482
I'm gonna be sick.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.276
Don't let go.

28:57.444 --> 28:59.611
-I'm letting go.
-Don't let go.

29:02.824 --> 29:03.824
He let go.

29:10.165 --> 29:12.875
-A jellybean?
-All right, Lucas.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.793
Good thinking.

29:15.545 --> 29:17.337
Slingshot, hooyah.

29:25.597 --> 29:28.265
-All right, Lucas. Good job.
-Yeah, Peanut, you rule.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.518
-Come on, we're losing. Let's go.
-Good job, Lucas.

29:31.686 --> 29:33.312
-Did we win yet?
-Almost.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.398
We just have to get the sweet rock
over the finish line.

29:36.566 --> 29:37.775
Come on, let's go.

29:39.152 --> 29:41.487
Hurry up, Peanut.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.615
Yeah, right.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.700
Hurry, Lucas, climb the wall.

29:46.868 --> 29:48.118
Climb fast, Peanut.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.536
They're catching up.

29:49.913 --> 29:51.538
Bye-bye, loser.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.290
Climb the wall.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.293
Come on. Climb the wall.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.086
Come on.

29:58.797 --> 30:01.048
Forget it. This game is rigged.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.217
-Ladder.
-Hooyah.

30:03.384 --> 30:07.346
Come on. Let's go. Go, go, go.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.473
We got it. We go it. Yeah, man. All right.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.058
Red rules.

30:13.394 --> 30:14.895
Red team wins.

30:15.271 --> 30:18.106
All right. We did it.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.820
Thanks for trying.

30:34.582 --> 30:36.583
Lucas, you did fine, really.

30:36.751 --> 30:39.211
You just need to discover the ant within.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.755
Start by visualizing yourself with six legs.

30:41.923 --> 30:44.007
-Then, if you--
-How's that gonna get me home?

30:44.175 --> 30:46.677
Look at me. I'm not a stupid ant.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.681
Lucas, being an ant means more
than just having six legs or--

30:50.849 --> 30:54.226
Or lifting 10 times your own weight
or walking vertically up a wall...

30:54.394 --> 30:57.938
...it's being part of a colony.
Not always thinking of yourself first.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.399
-Oh, careful.
-Hey, don't touch me.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.609
I'm trying to help you.

31:02.777 --> 31:04.152
You think this is easy for me?

31:04.320 --> 31:06.572
Being the Destroyer's little helper?

31:06.739 --> 31:10.617
So you worry about you,
and I'll worry about me.

31:10.994 --> 31:12.661
Oh, Lucas.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.454
That's not the way ants are.

31:14.622 --> 31:17.875
Oh, Hova, that's the way I am.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.794
Well, if I could just--

31:22.589 --> 31:23.797
Just what?

31:24.257 --> 31:27.384
Hello? Earth to ant lady.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.887
You were in the middle
of sounding like my mom.

31:30.346 --> 31:32.764
They're coming. Run!

31:33.808 --> 31:35.809
Hey. Hey! What's wrong?

31:41.900 --> 31:44.568
-They're after the herd.
-What herd?

31:46.946 --> 31:48.447
Whoa, easy, girl.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.324
Easy.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.494
Take cover.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.124
Tell the queen I love her.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.252
Oh, we're cut off.

32:06.007 --> 32:10.385
Come, brothers, for queen and colony.

32:18.269 --> 32:20.145
Get to the grass.

32:20.688 --> 32:22.022
Attack formation.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.191
Load them up.

32:26.694 --> 32:29.696
-Enemy fire.
-Watch your wing. Watch your wing.

32:29.864 --> 32:32.032
-Now, that's gotta sting.
-Nice shot.

32:33.660 --> 32:35.035
My turn.

32:35.495 --> 32:37.329
-Thanks.
-Where's Hova?

32:37.497 --> 32:39.206
I don't know.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.999
Come on.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.002
To your positions. Ready.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.506
Squirt.

32:56.307 --> 32:59.059
Don't.
Please, I was just following orders.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.687
Who wants magic?

33:01.854 --> 33:03.563
Clacktiel.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.070
You look tasty.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.655
Leave him alone.

33:14.575 --> 33:16.827
Hova? Oh, quick, get out of my way.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.161
Move.

33:18.329 --> 33:20.706
-Hova.
-Hurry.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.249
Everyone, into the grass.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.835
Don't just stand there. Help her.

33:25.837 --> 33:27.629
Lucas, run.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.006
What are you doing?

33:33.553 --> 33:35.053
Everyone, into the grass.

33:59.787 --> 34:01.705
Where are you...

34:01.873 --> 34:03.790
...little bug?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.605
Please, hurry up. Light, light.

34:29.150 --> 34:31.443
Light, light.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.121
Hova, get down.

34:44.165 --> 34:45.831
Zoc.

34:50.838 --> 34:53.047
No!

34:54.509 --> 34:56.009
Stop, hey! No, no.

35:06.062 --> 35:07.354
Fire in the hole!

35:16.405 --> 35:18.615
-What was that?
-It's bath time.

35:18.783 --> 35:19.866
Retreat.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.046
They're leaving.

35:33.214 --> 35:34.506
We-- We won.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.470
All hail the Destroyer.

35:40.638 --> 35:42.055
Peanut! Peanut!

35:42.223 --> 35:43.682
Brilliant. Genius.

35:43.850 --> 35:45.350
I mean, Lucas made a:

35:45.518 --> 35:47.978
And then...they all flew away.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.397
And now I know
why they call you Peanut.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.900
He's got a brain the size of a peanut.

35:54.068 --> 35:55.735
Lucas the Destroyer.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.822
I take back everything
I thought about you.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.532
You saved us.

36:00.908 --> 36:02.993
Thank you, Lucas.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.912
Yeah, sure.

36:07.123 --> 36:08.999
He saved us.

36:09.167 --> 36:13.044
Oh, it's so obvious, I was so dumb.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.755
Praise the Destroyer.

36:15.923 --> 36:18.258
Wake up. He saved himself.

36:19.260 --> 36:20.427
The rest of us just--

36:21.304 --> 36:23.555
Just got in the way.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.183
Zoc. Oh, are you all right?

36:26.350 --> 36:27.809
-No, I'm--
-What happened to you?

36:27.977 --> 36:29.519
I'm fine. I'm fine.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.938
-You're hurt.
-No, it's nothing, really, I just--

36:32.106 --> 36:33.940
Zoc, do you have any yucca sap?

36:34.108 --> 36:37.360
Lucas has a burn. Poor baby.

36:38.279 --> 36:41.114
This is our enemy.

36:41.532 --> 36:45.076
They do not save ants, they kill ants.

36:45.244 --> 36:47.704
He very nearly killed me.

36:48.706 --> 36:50.874
Or does that not matter to you?

37:00.426 --> 37:03.929
I do, you do
We all like the honeydew

37:04.096 --> 37:05.597
Dinner is served.

37:05.765 --> 37:07.224
And I'm the dessert.

37:07.391 --> 37:09.976
And I'm on a low-fathead diet.

37:10.144 --> 37:12.479
And you know, it looks good on you.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.397
So, Lucas, what are you working on?

37:14.565 --> 37:15.565
Glasses.

37:18.069 --> 37:20.904
This is some good honeydew.

37:22.865 --> 37:26.326
Oh, Lucas, you have to try some.
It's so good.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.246
Go ahead.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.002
This is awesome.

37:36.170 --> 37:38.672
Tastes like green-apple bubble gum.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.681
That went away quick.
Another round for you?

37:47.848 --> 37:49.349
Oh, yeah, keep it coming.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.534
Get it while it's hot.

38:09.370 --> 38:12.622
Whoa, I didn't know
humans could change their colors.

38:12.790 --> 38:14.666
-Trippy.
-Perhaps our young pupa...

38:14.834 --> 38:17.252
...ate too much honeydew.

38:22.341 --> 38:23.967
Here, eat this.

38:24.135 --> 38:25.510
It'll make you feel better.

38:26.846 --> 38:29.014
What did that come out of?

38:29.640 --> 38:30.932
It's an alka root.

38:31.100 --> 38:35.145
Zoc discovered its powers to expel evil
and create well-being.

38:36.272 --> 38:38.398
He is a great wizard.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.567
Yeah, he hates me.

38:40.735 --> 38:42.277
Whoa, he really does, doesn't he?

38:42.445 --> 38:44.154
I mean, he hates your guts.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.032
It's actually amazing
how much he hates your guts.

38:47.199 --> 38:48.450
Okay, I'm sorry.

38:48.617 --> 38:52.454
Yes, Zoc has anger issues,
especially towards humans...

38:52.621 --> 38:54.080
...but he's a true ant.

38:54.498 --> 38:57.542
Hard on the outside,
but soft on the inside.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.420
Just give him time, Lucas.

39:18.731 --> 39:23.443
Praise the Mother.

39:24.820 --> 39:26.446
Thanks.

39:26.614 --> 39:29.115
Who is this mother
you keep talking about, anyway?

39:29.283 --> 39:30.367
Is it the queen?

39:30.534 --> 39:32.786
No, Lucas, the Ant Mother.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.788
The queen of queens.

39:34.955 --> 39:37.791
She gave birth to the first colony.

39:37.958 --> 39:40.668
To all ants.

39:40.836 --> 39:44.297
Come on. It's time for you to see.

39:59.480 --> 40:03.817
This is the Chamber of the Ages.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.655
What are these?

40:08.989 --> 40:12.534
They tell the story
of our colony, our history.

40:12.701 --> 40:14.994
These are pretty cool.

40:26.382 --> 40:29.759
This is the image of the Ant Mother.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.807
It is said that one day she will return...

40:35.975 --> 40:39.853
...and honeydew will pour
from the sky like rain.

40:40.020 --> 40:43.356
Then we will never go hungry again.

40:43.524 --> 40:46.192
So you actually want warm poop
to fall from the sky?

40:46.360 --> 40:50.029
Yes. That would be a blessed day.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.366
I'm sorry, it's just so beautiful.

40:53.784 --> 40:56.453
Hey, what's that one?

40:56.620 --> 40:58.329
It's the evil one.

40:59.039 --> 41:00.957
The Cloudbreather.

41:01.333 --> 41:04.419
It is ancient, drawn before our time.

41:04.587 --> 41:10.008
No one knows for sure what it is,
except that death is said to follow it.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.386
I think it's just a story used
to scare naughty pupas into behaving.

41:14.680 --> 41:17.390
No, the exterminator.

41:17.558 --> 41:18.892
I-- I gotta cancel him.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.477
I gotta go home now.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.020
But you're not an ant yet.

41:22.396 --> 41:24.397
-Just a quick visit.
-No way, Two Legs.

41:24.565 --> 41:26.566
The humans' nest is strictly forbidden.

41:27.651 --> 41:29.068
Well...

41:29.904 --> 41:31.988
...the colony needs food, right?

41:32.156 --> 41:33.698
Food?

41:33.866 --> 41:36.659
Yeah, sweet rocks.
My house is filled with them.

41:36.827 --> 41:40.288
-In assorted colors and flavors.
-Assorted flavors?

41:40.456 --> 41:41.748
Even the greenies?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.417
Well, you'll be needing a scout.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.503
No. There is no way
you're gonna get me--

41:46.670 --> 41:49.172
-I'm in.
-Come on.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.550
Better be some red ones.

41:56.096 --> 41:58.306
Wow, this is a big nest.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.267
Must have taken thousands
of humans to build this.

42:01.435 --> 42:03.603
-What's that?
-It's just the door.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.272
A door? Fantastic.

42:06.690 --> 42:08.942
Do all of your guests
pass under this door?

42:09.109 --> 42:12.946
Well, actually, you guys
are the first friends I've had over.

42:13.113 --> 42:14.822
We are the first ones?

42:14.990 --> 42:17.742
Kreela, we're the first ones
to pass under the door.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.036
-Great.
-And to think...

42:20.204 --> 42:23.623
...all of this is made from your own poop.

42:23.958 --> 42:25.124
Nice.

42:26.418 --> 42:29.796
Oh, why did Mom
have to get shag carpet?

42:29.964 --> 42:32.715
It'll take days to get to the kitchen.

42:32.883 --> 42:36.386
Oh, gee, that is too bad.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.348
I guess now we'll have to go home
before we all get in trouble.

42:42.893 --> 42:44.143
No.

42:45.312 --> 42:46.980
Wait.

42:51.193 --> 42:52.485
Come on.

42:52.653 --> 42:54.487
This is called hang-gliding.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.992
Have you ever done this, actually?

42:59.159 --> 43:00.368
I played the video game.

43:00.536 --> 43:03.079
Now, when I give the word,
everybody jump.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.835
Now.

43:11.964 --> 43:14.173
Oh, sorry, was that the word?

43:14.341 --> 43:16.509
-Coming.
-Hey, hey, look out.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.679
For queen and colony.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.931
Oh, God.

43:27.354 --> 43:31.566
-Showoff.
-Awesome. Yeah.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.778
This is Hawaii.
We went there last summer.

43:35.946 --> 43:39.282
It's got volcanoes and hula dancers
and Don Ho and surfboards.

43:39.450 --> 43:41.034
And I caught a fish.

43:42.411 --> 43:45.121
And these are the pyramids.
Well, not the real pyramids.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.124
The real ones are lots bigger.
Mommo says aliens built them.

43:48.292 --> 43:49.626
She's my grandma.

43:59.303 --> 44:01.137
Oh, are these your nest mates?

44:01.555 --> 44:04.015
Yeah, that's my family.

44:04.183 --> 44:05.308
Which one's the queen?

44:05.476 --> 44:08.186
My sister thinks she is.

44:09.229 --> 44:10.521
What's wrong?

44:10.689 --> 44:13.858
Nothing. It's just, well....

44:15.194 --> 44:18.237
I should have told
my mom goodbye. That's all.

44:18.864 --> 44:21.741
I can be a real jerk sometimes.

44:22.534 --> 44:25.036
-Lucas, your face is leaking.
-Leaking?

44:25.204 --> 44:28.081
Oh, no, it's okay.

44:28.248 --> 44:30.500
Is that what humans do
when they're sad?

44:30.668 --> 44:32.168
They leak from the face?

44:32.711 --> 44:36.297
When ants are sad, we do this:

44:56.110 --> 44:59.112
Oh, Lucas, it's-- It's--

44:59.279 --> 45:01.280
It's beautiful!

45:02.616 --> 45:05.284
Sweet rocks, come to papa!

45:23.095 --> 45:24.095
Red one.

45:24.263 --> 45:26.889
What are you doing?
Why aren't you taking the red ones?

45:27.057 --> 45:30.226
Well, it's actually
quite simple, sugar lips.

45:30.394 --> 45:31.811
I hate the red ones.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.063
Well, I love the red ones.

45:34.231 --> 45:35.732
-Hate them.
-I love them!

45:35.899 --> 45:37.608
-Hate, hate, hate.
-Love. Love.

45:37.776 --> 45:40.611
-Admit it, you find me attractive.
-What?

45:40.779 --> 45:43.489
Oh, how you tease me
with your sweet talk.

45:43.657 --> 45:45.950
Oh, you want some sweet talk?

45:46.118 --> 45:48.369
Because I'll give you some sweet talk.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.997
Now grab a red one
before I pull these off.

45:51.165 --> 45:52.749
Whoa, I need those.

45:54.626 --> 45:56.169
What are we doing?

45:56.336 --> 45:58.171
Nothing, nothing.

46:18.358 --> 46:21.152
-Mommo, I'm back!
-What was that?

46:22.029 --> 46:24.280
-Tiffany.
-What's a Tiffany?

46:24.448 --> 46:25.865
-Hurry up!
-Right.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.700
Leave the red ones behind!

46:27.868 --> 46:29.619
Fugax!

46:31.538 --> 46:33.873
Hey, pipsqueak, you there?

46:34.041 --> 46:35.792
Hello?

46:35.959 --> 46:37.710
Crossfire!

46:38.086 --> 46:42.048
That kid and his stupid electronic toys.

46:46.136 --> 46:47.678
What is he doing?

46:47.846 --> 46:50.139
Jumping. You know,
hippity hop, uppity downy?

46:50.307 --> 46:52.308
It's a scout thing.
You wouldn't understand.

46:52.684 --> 46:54.602
Okay, come on. One more.

46:54.770 --> 46:55.812
I just need a seven.

46:59.399 --> 47:03.027
-Hello. How are you?
-Hi.

47:03.195 --> 47:05.112
Pizza Kingdom. Hail to the king.

47:05.280 --> 47:09.075
Would you like to try our new
Princess Pepperoni with tangy Jester Sauce?

47:09.451 --> 47:11.619
Hello! This is Lucas Nickle!

47:11.787 --> 47:13.913
I need to cancel my order!

47:16.834 --> 47:17.875
What?

47:18.043 --> 47:19.377
You don't want to order?

47:21.672 --> 47:23.840
Please cancel the contract!

47:24.007 --> 47:28.761
-No exterminator!
-No extra tomato. Got it.

47:30.597 --> 47:32.807
Yes. No exterminator.

47:32.975 --> 47:34.934
I'm canceling the contract.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.062
What? You-- You wanna cancel?

47:38.230 --> 47:39.230
Who is this?

47:39.398 --> 47:41.274
Oh, Bill, is this you, man?

47:41.441 --> 47:44.610
You got me, man. You got me, dude.

47:46.488 --> 47:47.738
That's a relief.

47:47.906 --> 47:51.450
Okay, Lucas, I don't understand
most of what just happened.

47:51.618 --> 47:53.077
What is an exterminator?

47:53.245 --> 47:57.123
Oh, don't worry. Everything's okay now.

48:04.548 --> 48:06.215
Hide!

48:09.511 --> 48:12.346
This is Tiff. Hi, Mom.

48:12.514 --> 48:15.766
Yeah, everything's fine.
Lucas is being a pest.

48:17.477 --> 48:18.769
He's in his room playing...

48:18.937 --> 48:20.646
-...those stupid video games.
-No, no!

48:21.315 --> 48:23.774
I will. I will. Okay, Mom.

48:24.192 --> 48:29.280
Yes. I'm hugging the phone too. Bye.

48:34.995 --> 48:36.954
You must be Queen Tiffany.

48:37.122 --> 48:38.664
Allow me to introduce--

48:51.303 --> 48:53.012
Remember your training.

48:55.432 --> 48:57.475
Oh, no. No, no, no! Mother!

48:59.811 --> 49:03.189
We're sorry. Your call
cannot be completed as dialed.

49:03.357 --> 49:05.024
Hello?

49:06.026 --> 49:08.486
Tiffany, no! You'll squish Lucas.

49:08.654 --> 49:10.947
Hello. Nobody's shrunk.
Gotta go. Bye-bye.

49:11.114 --> 49:12.365
What are you talking about?

49:12.532 --> 49:15.284
Lucas! You let him go. It's me you want.

49:15.452 --> 49:21.207
Come back. Probe me instead. Lucas!

49:24.044 --> 49:27.088
Bring back Lucas, you alien scum!

49:27.255 --> 49:29.256
Oh, Lucas. Lucas.

49:29.424 --> 49:30.841
-Okay, Mommo.
-Lucas.

49:31.009 --> 49:34.220
Let's go find your other teeth.

49:52.864 --> 49:56.283
Hova, where are you?

50:07.462 --> 50:11.549
Hova? Hova! Are you all right?

50:12.092 --> 50:14.427
Are we all right? Of course.
Why wouldn't we be?

50:14.594 --> 50:17.513
We're fine. We're all right. Silly.

50:18.348 --> 50:20.307
Whoa, whoa, wait.
No, wait, now, hold up.

50:20.475 --> 50:22.643
Zoc! Zoc, guess what we did?

50:22.811 --> 50:24.937
We went to Hawaii.
We saw the pyramids.

50:25.105 --> 50:26.480
We flew without wings.

50:26.648 --> 50:28.274
At first, it was like:

50:28.442 --> 50:29.942
But then it was:

50:30.110 --> 50:33.446
Of course, the others were terrified,
so I took charge. And then we....

50:33.613 --> 50:36.073
We were inside the humans' nest.

50:36.241 --> 50:39.285
Humans' nest? That's forbidden!

50:39.453 --> 50:40.536
Right, right.

50:40.704 --> 50:43.539
But the nest was filled
with sweet rocks, okay.

50:43.707 --> 50:45.207
Lots of them.

50:45.375 --> 50:49.462
But then Queen Tiffany started swatting,
some massive flying teeth attacked us...

50:49.629 --> 50:52.423
...and, well, here we are.
What a day. Good night.

50:52.591 --> 50:56.052
And who told you
about these sweet rocks?

50:56.219 --> 50:59.472
-Lucas, of course.
-Really?

51:02.142 --> 51:04.101
Hi, there. How are you?

51:05.645 --> 51:08.481
-Okay.
-Okay. That's good.

51:08.648 --> 51:10.441
It's good to be okay.

51:10.609 --> 51:15.321
Listen, I just wanted
to show you something, if that's okay.

51:16.364 --> 51:18.365
You know what this is?

51:18.658 --> 51:22.495
This is the potion that will
make you big again.

51:22.788 --> 51:26.665
I just wanted you to take
a good, long look at it.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.919
Because this is the last time
you will ever see it.

51:31.171 --> 51:32.588
What do you mean?

51:32.756 --> 51:37.009
I mean, there is no way I am ever
going to make you big again.

51:38.804 --> 51:43.724
Ever. You are a threat
to every ant in this colony.

51:43.892 --> 51:45.851
Especially to Hova.

51:46.019 --> 51:48.437
But I would never do anything
to hurt Hova.

51:48.605 --> 51:51.690
I just-- I--

51:51.858 --> 51:53.859
I just wanna go home.

51:54.027 --> 51:55.611
Well, then, if I were you...

51:55.779 --> 52:01.075
...I'd try to find help somewhere else,
because there is nothing for you here.

52:03.411 --> 52:04.787
Nothing.

52:16.716 --> 52:18.717
The pain, the pain! It's unbearable.

52:18.885 --> 52:20.386
Just put me out of my misery!

52:20.554 --> 52:22.221
Oh, hold still, you big pupa.

52:22.389 --> 52:24.723
I haven't even touched you yet.

52:25.892 --> 52:27.852
Be gentle with me.

52:37.070 --> 52:39.572
-Where's Lucas?
-Isn't he with you?

52:39.781 --> 52:44.994
-No.
-Lucas? Lucas? That's weird.

52:45.287 --> 52:48.747
Well, he's probably off destroying
some other poor, unfortunate colony.

52:48.915 --> 52:50.916
You know how they are. Destroyers.

52:51.626 --> 52:53.002
Zoc, what have you done?

52:53.170 --> 52:56.338
-Me? What did I do?
-Where is he?

52:56.506 --> 52:57.923
He's gone.

52:58.091 --> 53:01.218
-He led you into a trap, Hova.
-There was no trap.

53:01.386 --> 53:04.597
He led us to food.
He was trying to protect us from....

53:04.764 --> 53:07.183
-From what? What, Hova?
-From something.

53:07.350 --> 53:08.809
Oh, something!

53:08.977 --> 53:11.061
And I was worried it was from nothing.

53:11.229 --> 53:12.855
He's blinded you, Hova.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.274
No, you are the one who's blind.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.694
You are so consumed
by your hatred for the humans...

53:18.862 --> 53:22.114
-...you see only what you want to see.
-Oh, come on.

53:22.407 --> 53:26.243
Zoc, I see a young pupa,
a human learning our ways...

53:26.411 --> 53:30.122
...becoming part of this colony,
becoming an ant.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.708
-Impossible.
-Listen to yourself, Zoc.

53:32.876 --> 53:36.462
"A wizard knows no such word."
So, what are you now?

53:36.755 --> 53:39.215
Certainly not the ant I love.

53:39.591 --> 53:41.133
Hova!

53:41.301 --> 53:43.969
I did it for you, for the colony.

53:44.137 --> 53:46.305
You did it for yourself.

53:46.932 --> 53:48.641
Hova, I....

53:50.852 --> 53:52.728
He won't make it
through the night alone.

53:52.896 --> 53:54.939
Fugax, your leg's broken.

53:55.106 --> 53:57.441
Yeah, but I still have five good ones.

53:57.609 --> 53:59.526
Very good ones.

53:59.694 --> 54:03.239
You know, I believe he was trying
to protect us from something.

54:03.490 --> 54:05.491
See you, Zoc.

54:28.098 --> 54:30.140
Maybe Zoc is right.

54:30.392 --> 54:33.310
Now I'll never get home.

54:35.605 --> 54:38.440
Hi! Nice evening, huh?

54:38.608 --> 54:39.650
Oh, may I?

54:40.527 --> 54:41.652
Sure, help yourself.

54:41.820 --> 54:45.781
Thanks, I love water! I'm a beetle
that loves water, but I'm not a water beetle.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.617
Isn't that funny? I'm a beetle--

55:25.905 --> 55:27.406
Hey, Lucas.

55:28.450 --> 55:31.952
Hey, anybody know what...means?

55:32.662 --> 55:35.080
I think I just figured it out.

55:36.082 --> 55:37.166
Croaker!

55:40.712 --> 55:42.004
This way!

55:49.012 --> 55:50.679
Don't ever leave me again.

55:50.847 --> 55:53.182
-But Zoc told me--
-You are my pupa, not Zoc's.

55:56.770 --> 55:58.270
Lucas, come on.

56:04.235 --> 56:07.863
Climb! You can do it. Just concentrate.

56:08.990 --> 56:10.783
I'm an ant. Okay, I'm an ant.

56:10.950 --> 56:13.994
-He's got it. He's got it.
-Look, I'm an ant!

56:14.162 --> 56:17.039
He hasn't got it.

56:24.798 --> 56:26.799
Grab hold!

56:28.635 --> 56:30.386
Hova?

56:32.472 --> 56:34.431
Lucas!

56:48.363 --> 56:51.657
Wow, we came right
down that guy's throat, didn't we?

56:51.825 --> 56:53.534
Hey, smiley, you're on my wing.

56:53.701 --> 56:55.661
Oh, oh, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

56:55.829 --> 56:57.329
So, what do you guys do?

56:57.497 --> 57:00.499
I'm a glowworm. I glow.

57:00.667 --> 57:01.875
That's great!

57:02.043 --> 57:04.545
You're really starting
to irritate me. Can you--?

57:09.259 --> 57:11.718
Oh, gross.

57:11.970 --> 57:14.721
Will you quit eating, fatso?

57:14.889 --> 57:16.849
It's cramped in here.
There's no more room!

57:17.016 --> 57:21.770
Don't worry. I'm afraid we will be
moving along in due course.

57:21.938 --> 57:23.564
Always with the negative with you.

57:23.731 --> 57:27.109
Why can't you be more-- Hey, Lenny!

57:27.527 --> 57:28.944
This is what I'm talking about.

57:29.112 --> 57:32.406
Lenny always has a smile on his face--

57:35.118 --> 57:36.952
Let me out! Let me out!

57:37.120 --> 57:40.164
-I don't wanna be a toadstool!
-"A toadstool." That's great.

57:40.331 --> 57:41.915
-You like that?
-That's very funny.

57:42.083 --> 57:44.209
There's plenty more
where that came from, pal.

57:44.377 --> 57:46.211
I like-- Hi, what's your name?

57:46.379 --> 57:48.505
There he goes again.

57:49.757 --> 57:51.884
Stop! Come back!

57:52.051 --> 57:53.427
-Hova!
-No!

57:53.595 --> 57:56.138
Hova, he's gone.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.558
Croaker, over here. This way!

57:59.726 --> 58:00.893
-Zoc!
-Zoc!

58:01.060 --> 58:03.228
I am delicious, eat me.

58:03.396 --> 58:05.564
Zoc, are you crazy?

58:05.732 --> 58:08.358
-He's crazy.
-Hey, froggy!

58:10.403 --> 58:13.322
No relationship is worth this.

58:18.411 --> 58:22.039
Oh, sure. Why not? Come on in.

58:22.207 --> 58:25.542
-Welcome to paradise.
-Zoc! How'd you get here?

58:25.710 --> 58:27.920
I sure didn't come in
through the rear entrance.

58:28.087 --> 58:30.756
Welcome. Make yourself at home. Hi.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.424
Who is this? Your ant?

58:32.592 --> 58:35.344
Zoc, you are crazy.
You're inside a frog, for Mother's sake.

58:35.512 --> 58:37.346
What are you doing? This is impossible!

58:37.514 --> 58:40.265
"Listen to yourself, Zoc.
A wizard knows no such word.

58:40.433 --> 58:42.684
So, what are you now?"

58:44.729 --> 58:46.104
Weirdo.

58:46.898 --> 58:48.607
What does she see in you?

58:48.775 --> 58:51.693
-What does she see in you?
-Exactly!

58:55.657 --> 58:57.282
Not me.

58:57.617 --> 59:00.953
-Hey, is that...?
-Alka root? So it is.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.290
-Oh, no.
-Oh, my.

59:08.670 --> 59:10.629
You might wanna let go of that.

59:10.797 --> 59:13.632
Oh, no. So you can grab it?
I don't think so.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.802
-Hands in the air.
-Oh, my.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.642
Wow, that was great!

59:23.810 --> 59:26.603
Hey, we sure owe you one!
Thanks a lot!

59:27.021 --> 59:30.315
I'm free! I'm free!

59:31.568 --> 59:34.111
Oh, crap.

59:36.906 --> 59:40.200
Hey, Zoc, thanks. But why'd you do it?

59:40.368 --> 59:43.829
An ant will sacrifice himself
for his friends.

59:43.997 --> 59:47.249
-I thought you hated me.
-I didn't do it for you.

01:00:02.515 --> 01:00:04.850
All right, well, we should
camp here for the night.

01:00:05.018 --> 01:00:07.561
Come on, Fugax. Let's forage some food.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:10.689
Excuse me? I don't forage.

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:13.233
I'll scout for food.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:14.860
Right, let's go.

01:00:15.194 --> 01:00:17.112
Zoc, stay with Lucas.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.864
He's been through a lot today.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.908
-Hova, please, don't ask me to--
-He's not what you think.

01:00:22.076 --> 01:00:23.910
There is goodness in him.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:26.830
There's an ant in him.

01:00:27.373 --> 01:00:30.083
See, he really is trying.

01:00:30.251 --> 01:00:31.960
Come on. You can do it.

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:36.381
-Concentrate.
-One, two, three.

01:00:36.591 --> 01:00:40.802
Think ant. Ant. Ant.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:44.222
Yeah, all right.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:47.726
Craznocks.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:00:58.278
It's funny.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:01.740
The sky looks exactly the same.

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:04.326
Everything else is so different...

01:01:04.494 --> 01:01:07.746
...but it's the same sky, the same stars.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:12.042
Why must you keep doing that?

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:16.672
-Are you ill?
-What? Oh, you mean yawning.

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:20.175
-I'm just tired.
-Please stop. It's disgusting.

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:25.472
-Ants don't yawn?
-Definitely not, thank you.

01:01:27.558 --> 01:01:31.895
So this city of yours, it's like a nest?

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:34.773
Well, yeah. Kind of.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:37.651
And the humans that live there
are all brothers...

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:40.779
...working together
for the greatness of their colony?

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.281
Well, not exactly.

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:48.286
It's a little more like,
you know, every man for himself.

01:01:48.621 --> 01:01:50.914
But that's so primitive.

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:52.624
How does anything get done?

01:01:52.917 --> 01:01:54.751
Some people work together.

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:56.795
Some. Why not all?

01:01:57.296 --> 01:02:00.465
I suppose it's because
of their differences.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:03.260
But it's the differences
that make a colony strong.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:07.097
Foragers, scouts, drones,
nurses, regurgitators...

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:10.517
...all are different,
but an essential part of the whole.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.145
This is where we ants draw our strength.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:16.606
My differences just get me beat up.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:19.443
-And why is that?
-I don't know.

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:23.488
Some humans prefer to clobber people
they don't understand.

01:02:23.656 --> 01:02:27.367
Like you prefer to clobber ants.

01:02:28.202 --> 01:02:31.371
I guess I didn't think
about what I was doing.

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:33.999
Seems to happen a lot.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:40.756
I suppose sometimes I, too,
can act without thinking.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:46.845
Perhaps in this way, we are alike.

01:02:49.807 --> 01:02:52.100
Good night, Lucas.

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:53.935
Good night, Zoc.

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:36.353
-What's the matter?
-Look!

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:38.563
-What is it? What's wrong?
-I see her!

01:03:38.731 --> 01:03:40.565
-Who her?
-The Ant Mother!

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:42.984
She's come! She's here!

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.073
Look! Look!

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:54.371
What do you know?

01:03:55.122 --> 01:03:56.915
There really is an--

01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.253
No.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.889
Cloudbreather.

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:15.642
But I cancelled the contract.

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.770
Praise the Mother!

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:20.772
-Praise the Mother!
-She's come at last!

01:04:21.065 --> 01:04:24.526
Everyone, please, calm down.

01:04:28.906 --> 01:04:32.284
Listen to me! It is not the Ant Mother!

01:04:32.451 --> 01:04:35.787
-It is a Cloudbreather!
-It's true.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:38.790
He's come to wipe out the entire colony.

01:04:39.208 --> 01:04:40.792
How can we possibly fight back?

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.711
His magic is strong.

01:04:45.256 --> 01:04:46.756
Sprayers.

01:04:48.259 --> 01:04:49.926
Foggers.

01:04:50.469 --> 01:04:51.970
Oh, that's the stuff.

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.805
Zappers.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.224
Sulfur bombs.

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.568
And how do you know of this creature?

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:08.862
Because....

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:12.282
-Because I brought him here.
-Lucas!

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:13.617
I knew it. I told you.

01:05:13.784 --> 01:05:17.537
-Guards, remove this human.
-Come on, kid.

01:05:17.705 --> 01:05:19.956
-Hova!
-Lucas!

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:24.502
-No.
-Wait. The potion.

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:30.133
That's it! Zoc, you shrunk me.
You can shrink the Cloudbreather.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.511
We can load these things up and then:

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:35.180
Right in the ear!

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.767
Yes. Yes, perhaps.

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:41.728
But the Cloudbreather
towers above us like a tree.

01:05:41.896 --> 01:05:43.521
How do we get close enough?

01:05:43.689 --> 01:05:45.190
I've got an idea.

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:50.278
Zoc, you would trust this human?

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:01.498
Yoo-hoo, hello?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:03.667
We need to talk to you.

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:06.753
Show yourselves.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:11.049
Down here. Hello?

01:06:18.182 --> 01:06:22.519
Well, well, well.
Just in time for lunch.

01:06:22.687 --> 01:06:24.396
-Hello.
-Wait.

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:27.190
Listen to me. We come in peace.

01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:31.528
The exterminator's here. He brings
death clouds that will destroy us all...

01:06:31.696 --> 01:06:33.989
...unless we can work together
to stop him.

01:06:34.448 --> 01:06:36.950
Death clouds, huh?

01:06:37.118 --> 01:06:39.661
Okay, let's eat.

01:06:41.747 --> 01:06:43.248
Get behind me.

01:06:55.803 --> 01:07:01.266
Sir, the east nest, totally destroyed.

01:07:01.642 --> 01:07:03.893
The cloud is coming.

01:07:04.270 --> 01:07:07.147
The cloud!

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:22.787
What do you have in mind?

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:31.755
Remember, you only get one shot at it.

01:07:31.922 --> 01:07:36.134
Don't fire until you see
the wax of his ears.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:38.970
-Understood.
-Ready? Lucas?

01:07:39.138 --> 01:07:42.474
-Good to go.
-Hey. Hey. Stop it. Stop it.

01:07:42.641 --> 01:07:46.144
Zoc! Can I switch? Mine's broken.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:49.064
All right, boys. Heat them up.

01:07:54.695 --> 01:07:57.322
Let's fly.

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:20.011
Hey, that looks fun. Let's help, shall we?

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:23.848
Okay. I only live two weeks anyway.

01:08:24.015 --> 01:08:26.350
Good for you.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:38.029
First wave, attack!

01:08:43.285 --> 01:08:46.662
So you want to rumble, huh?
Come on. Come on.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:48.372
Come on!

01:08:48.541 --> 01:08:49.999
I'm going in.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:03.011
I can't get through.
He's got some kind of shield.

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.723
Craznocks. Headphones!

01:09:29.081 --> 01:09:32.250
For queen and colony!

01:09:34.461 --> 01:09:35.712
Yeah.

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.841
Why have you stopped?

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:44.511
Oh, geez. Boy, that hurts. Please stop.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.180
Bye-bye.

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:57.066
We'll have to land on him.
Find a way in.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:04.782
He's reloading! Now's our chance.

01:10:09.538 --> 01:10:11.414
Draw!

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.502
Zoc!

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:30.308
-Welcome to the scalp.
-Hello.

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.810
-Have a slice.
-Enjoy.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:36.439
Fingers!

01:10:36.607 --> 01:10:38.691
He's scratching again!

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:42.237
-To the armpit!
-Dive, dive!

01:10:49.036 --> 01:10:51.996
Leave my friends alone!

01:10:58.212 --> 01:11:00.255
Don't pick your nose.
Don't pick your nose.

01:11:06.178 --> 01:11:09.013
-Need a lift?
-Thanks.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.784
No.

01:11:30.744 --> 01:11:33.913
Hova, are you okay?

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.665
What?

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.043
Nighty night.

01:11:40.087 --> 01:11:41.337
Run!

01:11:45.551 --> 01:11:48.845
Come on, get up!
We got to go, we got to go!

01:11:49.054 --> 01:11:50.722
I'm done, little ant.

01:11:57.021 --> 01:11:59.731
Run! Run!

01:12:01.525 --> 01:12:03.818
Lucas, go on.

01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:06.070
Save yourself.

01:12:19.543 --> 01:12:22.503
That's not the way ants are.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:27.216
Hurry up.

01:12:42.566 --> 01:12:44.692
Lucas? Lucas!

01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:50.323
Lucas!

01:12:56.413 --> 01:12:58.456
You did it. You did it!

01:12:59.458 --> 01:13:01.667
Now, that's an ant.

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:03.086
Oh, sorry.

01:13:03.545 --> 01:13:05.797
Thanks, kid.

01:13:15.307 --> 01:13:17.225
Oh, yeah!

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:21.312
-Our weapons are useless.
-We just need a clear shot.

01:13:24.983 --> 01:13:27.944
Hey, wait. A shot.

01:13:30.155 --> 01:13:33.157
Okay, now what?

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:37.328
Well, I don't know,
because I've never attacked before.

01:13:37.496 --> 01:13:39.580
-Isn't that funny?
-Hilarious.

01:13:39.998 --> 01:13:42.625
Oh, look. Here's a way in.

01:13:45.587 --> 01:13:49.507
Enjoy a world that's entirely bug free

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:54.011
Call Beals-A-Bug
And leave the bug-killing to me

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:04.355
Okay, I'm feeling like we ought to attack
something in here.

01:14:05.357 --> 01:14:08.067
Hey, that looks vulnerable.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.653
Perfect.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:17.827
Oh, look. Here's our way out.

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:21.038
Let's give this human a goodbye kiss.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.460
Pucker up, Mr. Beals!

01:14:51.236 --> 01:14:53.863
No, no, no.

01:14:54.031 --> 01:14:56.407
Stop. Just get away from me.
Get away from me.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.458
You can't exterminate me.

01:15:05.626 --> 01:15:09.086
Oh, yeah. I'm Stan Beals!

01:15:09.254 --> 01:15:11.005
Oh, no, no, no!

01:15:13.091 --> 01:15:15.760
Praise the Mother!

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.602
Lucas! Lucas! Lucas!

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:37.740
This day I no longer see
a human among ants...

01:15:37.908 --> 01:15:41.869
...but instead a single colony.

01:15:42.037 --> 01:15:44.997
No more Lucas the Destroyer...

01:15:45.165 --> 01:15:48.543
...but Rokai the ant.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.298
Welcome to the colony.

01:15:55.592 --> 01:15:58.678
Isn't that wonderful?

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.847
-Rokai?
-It's an ant name.

01:16:02.015 --> 01:16:03.474
A wizard name.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:08.312
Rokai has earned his freedom.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:11.983
And we have earned a friend.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.319
Remember us.

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:19.824
Hey, Lucas--

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:24.078
I mean, Rokai.
Listen, once you get back...

01:16:24.246 --> 01:16:27.957
...if you get the chance, how about
dropping a few sweet rocks now and then?

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:31.294
You know, red ones, preferably.

01:16:31.461 --> 01:16:34.672
Red ones?
I thought you hated the red ones.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.635
Well, I do, but I'm starting to like them.

01:16:40.721 --> 01:16:43.598
I'm gonna miss you, Two Legs.

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:46.559
Calling a human "friend."

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:49.437
I thought that impossible until you came.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.356
But, Zoc, a wizard knows no such word.

01:16:53.025 --> 01:16:54.775
Very true.

01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:56.569
Here.

01:16:57.654 --> 01:17:00.740
But just wait until you're outside
before you drink it.

01:17:00.907 --> 01:17:03.826
I still think I should have eaten you
when I had the chance.

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:05.786
I am soft and chewy.

01:17:05.954 --> 01:17:08.831
But I promised the queen I wouldn't.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.042
I'm gonna miss you, Hova.

01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:13.794
We're going to miss you too, Rokai.

01:17:13.962 --> 01:17:15.463
Cross our hearts.

01:17:15.839 --> 01:17:18.466
Cross our hearts!

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:31.312
He's back. He's back!

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:37.652
He's in his birthday suit.
Happy birthday, Lucas!

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:41.238
Got you that time.

01:17:49.498 --> 01:17:51.916
Hi, Tiff. Is everything all right?

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.334
Where's Lucas?

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:57.004
Still locked in his room,
hiding from society.

01:17:57.339 --> 01:17:59.048
Mom, hey, Mom!

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:02.843
-Lucas, what is it?
-I forgot to tell you goodbye.

01:18:03.428 --> 01:18:05.346
Goodbye.

01:18:05.514 --> 01:18:09.016
Goodbye, Peanut. Oh, sorry,
I shouldn't call you that.

01:18:09.184 --> 01:18:11.852
It's okay. I don't mind.

01:18:12.312 --> 01:18:15.106
Casa, sweet casa.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.150
These suitcases are muy grande,
my little love nacho.

01:18:18.318 --> 01:18:19.777
How about getting the el door-o?

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:22.238
I don't know what you mean, honey.

01:18:22.406 --> 01:18:24.949
-Yeah, honey, the puerta, the--
-What's the puerta?

01:18:25.117 --> 01:18:28.411
-The door, the door!
-The door. Okay, I got it. I got it.

01:18:30.455 --> 01:18:34.125
Hey, Pukas, where you been?
We've been looking for you.

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:39.755
-I think someone's overdue for a dogpile.
-Yeah, dogpile!

01:18:39.923 --> 01:18:41.132
He said dogpile.

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:45.803
Stop saying everything I say, got it?

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:49.974
Stop saying everything you say. Got it.

01:18:50.142 --> 01:18:52.810
That's it. How about I dogpile you?

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:56.105
How about you leave him alone?
What the craznocks is wrong with you?

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:59.859
What? How about you make me?

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:04.530
Oh, that's right, you can't.

01:19:04.698 --> 01:19:08.826
Because I'm big and you're small.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:14.749
Yeah, I'm small. We're all small.
But together, we're big.

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:18.294
You think these stupid losers
are going to team up against me?

01:19:18.462 --> 01:19:23.007
I can do anything I want to them,
and there's nothing they can do about it.

01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:27.178
And the same goes for you, Pukas.

01:19:27.721 --> 01:19:29.680
Dogpile!

01:19:31.516 --> 01:19:35.519
I said, dogpile!

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:40.858
-You heard the man.
-Dogpile!

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:47.198
No! Don't hurt me! Mommy!

01:19:48.241 --> 01:19:50.367
Hey, you guys want to come over
and play?

01:19:50.535 --> 01:19:52.828
Yeah, cool. Come on, Lucas.

01:19:52.996 --> 01:19:55.748
I'll catch up.
There's something I gotta do first.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.751
Yeah! All right!

01:19:58.919 --> 01:20:00.461
Oh, yeah.

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.632
They sure grow up fast.

01:20:05.759 --> 01:20:07.802
-What?
-Look what I got.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:09.220
Oh, no. Zoc.

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:13.390
Zoc! Wait! Wait! No, no! Stop!

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.142
Come on.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.813
Stop it! I'm serious....

01:20:23.777 --> 01:20:25.236
Sweet rocks!

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.460
