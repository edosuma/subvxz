10:50.116 --> 10:51.618
I DON'T LIKE
THE WAY YOU ASK ‐‐

10:51.618 --> 10:52.886
SO THAT MEANS YES.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.454
MAGGIE, JIM ‐‐

10:54.454 --> 10:55.956
DAVID, AGAIN,
YOU HAVE HIS BACK.

10:55.956 --> 10:58.224
THIS IS A GREAT TRAIT,
BUT WAY OUT OF LINE RIGHT NOW.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.193
I HAVE MY BEST GUYS
RUNNING HER.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.268
I'LL KNOW
ALL ABOUT HER IN A FEW.

11:03.570 --> 11:05.806
NO NEED.
WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.

11:05.806 --> 11:08.174
NO, YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS
TO THE SAME KIND OF INTEL I DO.

11:08.174 --> 11:09.142
REALLY?

11:09.142 --> 11:12.312
NO, YOU DON'T.
IT'S HIGHLY CLASSIFIED.

11:12.312 --> 11:14.948
I'LL KNOW HOW MANY FRECKLES
SHE HAS IN ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

11:14.948 --> 11:16.249
SHE'S BLACK.

11:16.249 --> 11:17.784
BLACK PEOPLE
HAVE FRECKLES.

11:19.285 --> 11:20.687
WHY WOULD YOU
NEED TO KNOW THIS?

11:20.687 --> 11:22.288
WHAT?
ABOUT HER FRECKLES?

11:22.288 --> 11:25.091
WHY WOULD YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT CANDACE YOUNG?

11:25.091 --> 11:27.027
BECAUSE SOMETHING
IS GOING ON HERE,

11:27.027 --> 11:28.895
AND YOU'RE KEEPING ME
IN THE DARK!

11:28.895 --> 11:31.064
OKAY, JIM.

11:32.098 --> 11:34.701
I'M NOT THE ENEMY HERE.

11:34.701 --> 11:36.870
I'M A SOLVER OF PROBLEMS.

11:36.870 --> 11:40.440
I AM JUST TRYING TO HEAD OFF
ANY ISSUES

11:40.440 --> 11:42.442
THAT WE MAY HAVE WITH THIS WOMAN
BEFORE THEY START.

11:42.442 --> 11:45.111
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.
I'VE GOT IT UNDER CONTROL.

11:45.111 --> 11:46.847
I WILL HANDLE
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

11:46.847 --> 11:48.114
YOU HANDLE THE CAMPAIGN.

11:48.114 --> 11:49.983
YOUR PERSONAL LIFE
IS THE CAMPAIGN, JIM.

11:49.983 --> 11:51.718
THERE'S NO DISTINCTION
AT THIS POINT.

11:51.718 --> 11:52.853
YOU WANT TO WIN GOVERNOR?

11:52.853 --> 11:54.521
YOU BETTER TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON.

11:54.521 --> 11:56.557
I TOLD YOU I WILL HANDLE
CANDACE YOUNG.

11:56.557 --> 11:57.658
YOU BUTT OUT OF IT.

11:59.726 --> 12:01.267
OKAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ]
FINE.

12:01.267 --> 12:02.536
YOU KNOW, HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

12:02.536 --> 12:04.337
FINE.
BUT IF SOMETHING COMES UP

12:04.337 --> 12:06.406
IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CAMPAIGN,
I WILL WALK. I MEAN IT.

12:06.406 --> 12:08.374
I DON'T SET MYSELF UP
FOR FAILURE,

12:08.374 --> 12:10.176
AND I ONLY ASSOCIATE
WITH WINNERS.

12:10.176 --> 12:12.513
WHO THE HELL IS
RUNNING FOR GOVERNOR
HERE, ME OR YOU?

12:12.513 --> 12:13.747
YOU THINK
THIS IS ABOUT YOU?

12:13.747 --> 12:14.748
YES.

12:14.748 --> 12:16.449
JIM CRYER,
I COULD GIVE A RAT'S ASS

12:16.449 --> 12:18.151
IF YOU WIN GOVERNOR
BASED ON MERIT.

12:18.151 --> 12:19.686
I HAVE A REPUTATION
AS A WINNER.

12:21.054 --> 12:24.424
MAGGIE, TRUST US.

12:24.424 --> 12:26.392
IT'S FINE.

12:28.762 --> 12:30.864
WE'RE GONNA HANDLE THIS.

12:31.898 --> 12:33.800
ALL RIGHT.

12:34.868 --> 12:38.672
SHE BETTER NOT SHOW UP
TO ANY MORE EVENTS UNANNOUNCED.

12:40.073 --> 12:42.308
SHE WON'T.

12:44.077 --> 12:46.112
OKAY. [ CLEARS THROAT ]

12:46.112 --> 12:48.582
I HAVE A MEETING.

12:48.582 --> 12:50.517
[ CLEARS THROAT ]

12:50.517 --> 12:54.788
UH, WE'LL BE MEETING
THE A.M.E. ZION PASTORS
TOMORROW MORNING.

12:54.788 --> 12:56.590
WE NEED THE AFRICAN‐AMERICAN
VOTE IN RECORD NUMBERS,

12:56.590 --> 12:58.391
SO, DAVID, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO RUN POINT ON THIS.

12:58.391 --> 13:00.093
WE ALSO NEED TO REISSUE
A STATEMENT

13:00.093 --> 13:01.267
IN SUPPORT OF THE POLICE

13:01.267 --> 13:03.269
CATCHING THE DRIVER
WHO HIT THAT LITTLE GIRL.

13:03.269 --> 13:04.938
THERE'S GONNA BE
A MARCH TOMORROW.

13:04.938 --> 13:06.239
YOU BOTH
SHOULD BE THERE.

13:06.239 --> 13:09.776
OH, AND I GOT THIS OUT
OF THE POLICE CHIEF EARLY.

13:09.776 --> 13:13.046
IT'LL BE RELEASED TOMORROW,
SO WE SHOULD BE HOLDING IT UP.

13:13.046 --> 13:14.781
IT'S GOOD
WE GOT IT FIRST.

13:14.781 --> 13:16.282
AND, UH,
WHAT IS THIS?

13:16.282 --> 13:18.118
THE MOTHER OF THE LITTLE GIRL
SAW THE DRIVER.

13:18.118 --> 13:20.654
THAT'S A COMPOSITE SKETCH.

13:20.654 --> 13:22.288
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

[ DOOR OPENS ]

Candace: YOUR MOM WAS SICK.
Jeffery: YEAH.

13:46.412 --> 13:48.615
YOU CRIED ALL THE WAY HOME.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE ECSTATIC.

13:48.615 --> 13:50.183
YEAH, I AM.

13:50.183 --> 13:52.853
WHAT'S
HE DOING HERE?

13:52.853 --> 13:54.187
OH.

13:54.187 --> 13:55.589
SORRY WE'RE LATE.

14:01.301 --> 14:03.269

HI. HOW YOU DOING?

14:03.269 --> 14:04.605
HOW ARE YOU?
MWAH.

14:04.605 --> 14:07.307
SO, UM, I HAVE TO GO
AND GET CHANGED.

14:07.307 --> 14:11.311
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT
IF YOU TWO WENT AND GOT COFFEE.

14:11.311 --> 14:12.312
CANDACE, I CAN'T.

14:12.312 --> 14:14.214
YES, YOU CAN.
ENJOY YOURSELF.

NO, IT'S ‐‐ IT'S FINE.

14:30.196 --> 14:31.832
YOU SURE?

14:34.167 --> 14:36.102
YEAH.

14:37.337 --> 14:39.205
I SAW A LITTLE PLACE
AROUND THE CORNER.

14:40.406 --> 14:42.008
YEAH?

14:45.211 --> 14:46.680
OKAY.

14:53.253 --> 14:55.956

MAYBE. I GOT TO GO.

15:01.502 --> 15:03.136
ANY LUCK?

15:05.572 --> 15:07.373
NO.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.177
I CAN'T FIND
THAT DAMN CAR.

15:11.177 --> 15:13.213
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.781
ABOUT WHAT?

15:14.781 --> 15:17.117
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE
WYATT LEFT THE CAR,

15:17.117 --> 15:19.853
IT PROBABLY ENDED UP
IN A CHOP SHOP BY NOW.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.155
YEAH,
I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT, DAVID,

15:22.155 --> 15:24.290
BUT THAT WOULD BE
WAY TOO EASY.

15:24.290 --> 15:26.593
ONE CAN HOPE.

15:26.593 --> 15:29.362
WE NEED A LOT MORE THAN HOPE
RIGHT NOW.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.064
YES, I KNOW. I KNOW.
I KNOW.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.733
WELL,
WE DO HAVE YOUR PLAN.

15:32.733 --> 15:35.602
AND MY PLAN COULD WORK,
BUT IT HAS TO GO BY THE NUMBERS.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.037
AND THAT'S THE RISK IN IT.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.939
BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND, DAVID.

15:38.939 --> 15:41.742
IF YOU HAVE A BETTER PLAN,
THEN WE'LL GO WITH THAT.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.209
NO, I DON'T.
NO.

15:43.209 --> 15:47.480
WELL, THEN WE HAVE TO GO
WITH WHAT WE HAVE, DON'T WE?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.750
YES, WE DO,
BUT IT ‐‐ IT HAS TO ‐‐

15:49.750 --> 15:53.053
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.
OR ALL OF IT WILL BE FOR NAUGHT.

15:53.053 --> 15:54.788
I UNDERSTAND.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.757
YOU KNOW HANNA HAS TO MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE

15:56.757 --> 15:58.458
FOR THIS TO WORK.
SHE WILL.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.626
SHE HAS TO.
SHE WILL.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.835
FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND,
SHE'S FALLING APART.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.837
AND HOW
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

16:03.837 --> 16:07.240
I HAVE SOMEONE
IN THERE, OKAY?

16:07.240 --> 16:09.309
OKAY.

ABOUT CANDACE?

TALK ABOUT?

JUST DREAMING ANYMORE.

ARE YOU STILL INVOLVED
WITH HER?

THE NEXT 18 YEARS.

IT WAS MY MISTAKE.

17:00.727 --> 17:02.135
BUT NOW
IT'S CANDACE'S MISTAKE.

17:02.135 --> 17:03.303
AND WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

17:03.303 --> 17:04.838
SHE GOT MY DAUGHTER
INVOLVED.

17:04.838 --> 17:07.040
WHEN IT WAS JUST CANDACE AND I
PLAYING AROUND,

17:07.040 --> 17:08.108
THAT WAS A LOT OF FUN.

17:08.108 --> 17:09.876
THERE WERE THRILLS.

17:09.876 --> 17:11.311
BUT NOT ANYMORE.

17:11.311 --> 17:12.478
NOT ANYMORE.

AMANDA IS SUING KATHERYN AND I
FOR HER INHERITANCE.

17:17.017 --> 17:19.520
CANDACE IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR THAT?

17:19.520 --> 17:22.556
COME ON. YOU THINK AMANDA WOULD
THINK OF THAT ALL ON HER OWN?

17:28.261 --> 17:29.930
CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

17:29.930 --> 17:32.032
IT WON'T.

FOR TIME?

REALLY HAS IT OUT FOR ME

HELP HER BROTHER.

17:38.572 --> 17:40.273

SHE WANTED HIM MOVED
TO A PRIVATE FACILITY.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.910
WELL, CAN'T GET INVOLVED
IN THAT.

17:43.910 --> 17:45.011
I'M NOT INVOLVED IN THAT.

17:45.011 --> 17:46.680
I'M NOT GOING TO DO THAT.
I DIDN'T DO IT.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.549
GOOD.

17:48.549 --> 17:51.017
BUT IT PISSED HER OFF.

17:55.989 --> 17:57.891
IT'S TIME TO CALL
THE MALONES.

18:00.466 --> 18:01.635

18:15.481 --> 18:18.484
BUT THEY ARE RUTHLESS.

18:18.484 --> 18:21.922
THEY ARE NO LESS
THAN WHAT WE NEED.

18:21.922 --> 18:24.691
IT'S TOO EXTREME, DAVID.

18:26.426 --> 18:28.562

18:28.562 --> 18:31.665
YOU'D HAVE BEEN
THE FIRST ONE ON THE PHONE.

18:31.665 --> 18:34.901
SO APPARENTLY YOU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR THIS GAL.

18:34.901 --> 18:36.803
PLEASE.

18:36.803 --> 18:39.973
THEN CALL THE MALONES
NOW.

18:39.973 --> 18:41.875
I HAVE TO GET AMANDA
OUT OF THE APARTMENT FIRST.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.777
I DON'T WANT THEM HAVING
ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER.

18:43.777 --> 18:44.978
NO.

18:44.978 --> 18:47.047

OUT OF THE APARTMENT,

18:47.047 --> 18:49.650

HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING.

19:11.678 --> 19:13.814
WHY DO YOU CARE?

19:13.814 --> 19:15.649
YOU GOT TO KEEP
YOUR STRENGTH UP.

19:15.649 --> 19:17.518
DON'T WANT TO FAINT
BEFORE THE MIRACLE.

YOU A MAN OF FAITH?

19:23.890 --> 19:25.626
SOMEWHAT.

19:25.626 --> 19:27.160
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:28.995 --> 19:31.231
IT MEANS THAT I KNOW
THERE'S SOMETHING UP THERE.

19:31.231 --> 19:32.699
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS.

19:32.699 --> 19:34.134
HIS NAME IS JESUS.

19:34.134 --> 19:36.570
HMM. MAYBE.

19:38.471 --> 19:40.473
JUST NOT A RELIGIOUS GUY.

19:40.473 --> 19:43.209
I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON,
EITHER.

19:43.209 --> 19:44.878
I'M A SPIRITUAL PERSON

19:44.878 --> 19:47.814
WHO BELIEVES IN GOD
WITH ALL MY HEART.

HE'LL SAVE YOUR SON?

19:49.583 --> 19:51.051
YES, I DO.

19:51.051 --> 19:52.986
AND WHAT IF HE DOESN'T?

19:52.986 --> 19:55.455
HMM.

19:57.257 --> 20:00.193
IF HE DOESN'T, THEN I...

20:00.193 --> 20:03.770
WOULD LIKE TO THINK
THAT I WOULD...

20:03.770 --> 20:06.439
DO WHAT DAVID DID.

20:07.741 --> 20:08.775
DAVID?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.145
THE KING IN THE BIBLE.

20:13.279 --> 20:17.083
WROTE SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
PSALMS IN THE BIBLE.

20:19.753 --> 20:23.189
HE LOST HIS SON...

20:23.189 --> 20:27.694
AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE
AND PRAISED GOD.

20:29.229 --> 20:30.631
PRAISED GOD?

20:30.631 --> 20:31.898
MM‐HMM.

20:31.898 --> 20:35.235
HE TRUSTED GOD THAT MUCH.

20:35.235 --> 20:40.807
HE LOVED GOD SO MUCH...

20:40.807 --> 20:43.744
THAT HE PRAISED HIM...

20:43.744 --> 20:44.945
AND PRAISED HIM SO HARD

20:44.945 --> 20:47.047
THAT HE DANCED
RIGHT OUT OF HIS CLOTHES.

20:47.047 --> 20:49.149
WOW.

20:49.149 --> 20:53.386
'CAUSE NO MATTER WHAT,
HE'S STILL GOD.

20:53.386 --> 20:57.558
YOU SAID YOU'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT YOU'D DO WHAT HE DID?

20:57.558 --> 20:58.992
YOU'RE NOT SURE?

21:02.503 --> 21:06.106
I BELIEVE IN MY SOUL
THAT I WOULD DO THAT.

21:09.009 --> 21:14.715
BUT I'M A HUMAN PERSON HAVING
A SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCE.

21:14.715 --> 21:16.617
WELL, I'M TRYING TO.

21:18.184 --> 21:23.757
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE I'M CRYING
AND ONE MINUTE I'M ANGRY,

21:23.757 --> 21:28.161
AND THEN ANOTHER MINUTE
