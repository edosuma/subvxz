00:30.600 --> 00:32.159
Wait for me there, OK?

00:32.160 --> 00:33.479
WOMAN: Hi there.

00:33.480 --> 00:36.839
Can we get one candy floss
and one of these, please?

00:36.840 --> 00:39.079
Yeah, of course.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.120
How much is that, please?

01:00.120 --> 01:01.800
Where did you get that?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.639
MAN: OK, can we go over some kit,
please?

01:33.640 --> 01:35.079
BASS DRUM THUDS

01:35.080 --> 01:37.159
That's great.
And some snare, please?

01:37.160 --> 01:38.639
SNARE DRUM RATTLES

01:38.640 --> 01:40.559
That's great, thank you.
Hi, Anna.

01:40.560 --> 01:43.519
MAN: Chris, can you check
the overheads, please?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.239
Anna, can I ask you a favour?

01:45.240 --> 01:47.439
We're running over,
I'm not sure I'm going to have time

01:47.440 --> 01:48.879
to drop Roan off at Mum and Dad's.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.879
You want me to do it?
If you don't mind.

01:50.880 --> 01:52.520
OK. Fine.
Thanks so much.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.599
Hi. Anna's gonna drop you off
at Nana's.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.919
Be good, OK? See you tomorrow.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.679
PHONE RINGS

02:00.680 --> 02:03.200
I'll text you when...
Hi, Larry. Where are you?

02:04.160 --> 02:06.080
We're on in an hour.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.039
Mm-hm.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.280
Mm-hm.

02:11.480 --> 02:13.120
Really?
Come on.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.800
Happy birthday, darling.

02:45.560 --> 02:47.079
Thank you.

02:47.080 --> 02:48.320
Roy?

02:53.080 --> 02:56.240
I had no idea you had so many.

02:57.320 --> 02:58.959
Well, this isn't even
the half of it.

02:58.960 --> 03:00.800
This is just A to D.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.119
I am not sure we have the space.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.279
What are you talking about?

03:06.280 --> 03:08.559
You've got loads of space
in your spare room.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.479
Oh.

03:10.480 --> 03:12.520
You mean... my study.

03:14.200 --> 03:16.639
Well, we don't... We don't have
to move everything tonight.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.999
I-I haven't even had an offer
on the place yet.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.079
SHE CHUCKLES

03:21.080 --> 03:22.719
I am messing with you.

03:22.720 --> 03:26.280
I want you and all your clutter.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.200
How dare you call this clutter.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.440
Philistine.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.879
# Hey!
Don't know how you got in my head

03:54.880 --> 03:57.519
# But you were savvy
You were poison

03:57.520 --> 03:59.679
# Poison, poison
Poison lover

03:59.680 --> 04:01.959
# Found you, and I'm here in my bed

04:01.960 --> 04:04.679
# And see around you like my poison

04:04.680 --> 04:06.279
# Poison love

04:06.280 --> 04:09.279
# And I'm losing track of time

04:09.280 --> 04:13.319
# It's like
I've finally lost my mind, I

04:13.320 --> 04:15.719
# Don't know how you got in my head

04:15.720 --> 04:18.279
# But you were savvy
You were poison

04:18.280 --> 04:19.759
# Poison, poison

04:19.760 --> 04:22.760
# Poison lover

04:27.960 --> 04:31.759
# I see your face in the streetlight

04:31.760 --> 04:35.279
# You pull me close
Then you turn away

04:35.280 --> 04:37.759
# Go on and break the illusion

04:37.760 --> 04:40.679
# Leave me wanting more

04:40.680 --> 04:42.559
# I've been here before

04:42.560 --> 04:44.639
# I've been through that door

04:44.640 --> 04:48.279
# And it finds me every time

04:48.280 --> 04:49.719
# And I know it's... #

04:49.720 --> 04:51.319
WOMAN:
It's sold out, babe.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.999
WOMAN: I need to get in.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.439
They're giving their money
to a thief!

04:55.440 --> 04:58.439
I need to let them know the truth.
Step away now!

04:58.440 --> 05:03.520
MUSIC CONTINUES INSIDE

05:11.080 --> 05:12.999
Did you give it to him?

05:13.000 --> 05:14.280
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.999
# But I'm losing track of time

05:21.000 --> 05:25.039
# It's like
I've finally lost my mind, I

05:25.040 --> 05:27.119
# Don't know how you got in my head

05:27.120 --> 05:29.959
# But you were savvy
You were poison

05:29.960 --> 05:31.599
# Poison, poison

05:31.600 --> 05:33.999
# Poison lover. #

CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:38.440 --> 05:40.439
You guys are amazing.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.959
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:43.960 --> 05:47.039
So, we have some exciting news.

05:47.040 --> 05:50.319
A promoter heard
our Poison Lover EP,

05:50.320 --> 05:54.679
and they've asked us
to support Jocasta Rose on tour.

05:54.680 --> 05:56.199
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

05:56.200 --> 05:58.599
We're going to America, guys.
CHEERING

05:58.600 --> 06:00.759
LA!

06:00.760 --> 06:02.479
And we couldn't have done
any of this

06:02.480 --> 06:05.559
without our incredible manager,
Larry.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.959
Larry? Where are you?
MAN: Come on, Larry!

06:07.960 --> 06:10.000
Larry?
DISTANT CHEERING

06:18.000 --> 06:20.240
BOTTLES CLINK

06:21.880 --> 06:23.719
I've never been to LA.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.719
I've only ever been to, like,
Corfu, you know?

06:25.720 --> 06:28.439
I'm so pumped.
I wanna hire a big American car,

06:28.440 --> 06:31.639
drive along the coast.
I wanna be in a movie!

06:31.640 --> 06:34.399
Do you think I can convince Larry
to book us into the Chateau Marmont?

06:34.400 --> 06:36.119
I don't think you can convince Larry

06:36.120 --> 06:37.839
to spend a single penny more
than he has to.

06:37.840 --> 06:40.079
DOOR BELL RINGS
Oh, pizza! I'll get it.

06:40.080 --> 06:41.799
Right, vegan margarita's mine.
OK, guys?

06:41.800 --> 06:44.240
Don't forget to tip! Ooh!

06:53.360 --> 06:56.839
SHE CHOKES

06:56.840 --> 07:01.120
SIREN BLARES

07:04.880 --> 07:07.799
OFFICER:
Can you please stand back?

07:07.800 --> 07:10.279
I hear you got here early again.

07:10.280 --> 07:13.120
Care to comment, detective?
Care to name your source?

07:14.360 --> 07:17.119
House is rented by Gaia Lafayette.
She's a singer.

07:17.120 --> 07:20.159
She's a pretty big deal locally.
Her gig tonight was sold out.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.199
And the victim?
Amber Tanaka. She's a drummer.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.039
She also goes by the name of Tank.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.480
She's got severe chest injuries.
She's still in surgery.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.519
So, they said they ordered pizza.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.399
When the doorbell rang, the victim
volunteered to answer the door.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.039
Then they heard the gunshot.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.280
By the time they reacted,
the shooter was gone.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.319
What's with the antlers?

08:08.320 --> 08:12.199
That belongs to Gaia Lafayette.
She wears it on stage.

08:12.200 --> 08:15.239
So, she was here in the hallway
when Tanaka was shot?

08:15.240 --> 08:18.120
No. Tanaka was wearing it.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.920
So the shooter thought
they were aiming at Gaia.

08:30.920 --> 08:32.559
When you ring a doorbell,

08:32.560 --> 08:35.040
you'd expect the homeowner
to answer the door, wouldn't you?

08:50.560 --> 08:52.000
Miss Lafayette?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.039
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.759
This is my colleague,
DS Glenn Branson.

08:59.760 --> 09:00.999
Is Tank OK?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.519
We don't have any news yet, sorry.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.759
OK.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.439
I know this is a difficult time,

09:07.440 --> 09:09.079
and you're anxious
about your friend,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.519
but I need to ask you
some questions.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.959
I already talked
to one of your officers.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.280
I told them I have no idea
who would want to hurt Tank.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.159
Gaia, from what I've seen,

09:20.160 --> 09:23.879
I think you may have been
the intended target this evening.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.040
SHE EXHALES
She was wearing my head dress.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.919
Has anyone made any recent threats
against you?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.719
Either in person or online?

09:34.720 --> 09:36.160
Not that I know of.

09:37.520 --> 09:41.799
Larry, my manager, has his company
handle all my social media. OK.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.879
Have you noticed anyone
hanging around after gigs?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.400
Lots of people.

09:47.840 --> 09:50.199
Fans. Friends.

09:50.200 --> 09:53.479
How about anyone
who might've made you feel...

09:53.480 --> 09:54.759
uneasy?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.559
Uncomfortable?

09:56.560 --> 09:57.760
No.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.440
This doesn't make any sense.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.920
Why would anyone want to kill me?

10:07.320 --> 10:08.839
We don't know yet.

10:08.840 --> 10:12.679
But you might wanna consider
laying low for a while.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.120
At least while the investigation
is in progress.

10:39.240 --> 10:40.760
PHONE BEEPS

10:45.040 --> 10:46.879
Hey, Anna, I said no visitors today.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.120
We need to talk to him.
ANNA: OK, let me see if...

10:50.720 --> 10:53.040
PHONES RING

10:54.720 --> 10:57.559
Mr Brooker?
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.359
DS Glenn Branson.

10:59.360 --> 11:03.159
Course. Yeah. Yeah, of course.
Please, take a seat.

11:03.160 --> 11:07.039
I'm in a bit of a state today,
and I'm not taking meetings.

11:07.040 --> 11:09.039
It's been a huge shock to everyone.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.319
Any leads?

11:10.320 --> 11:15.359
Well, we believe that Gaia
may have been the intended target.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.359
Gaia? Why?

11:18.360 --> 11:21.039
We were hoping
you might have some insight.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.639
Yeah, of course. Anything to help.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.919
How long have you managed Gaia?

11:25.920 --> 11:28.959
HE INHALES
Coming up to seven years.

11:28.960 --> 11:34.399
And are you aware of any threats,
from fans, maybe?

11:34.400 --> 11:35.679
Well, online, yeah,

11:35.680 --> 11:37.760
but that's just the way it goes
these days, you know.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.119
We, er... We moderate
the social media of our acts

11:41.120 --> 11:42.880
just to protect them
from the worst of it.

11:43.840 --> 11:45.959
Describe the worst to me.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.839
Well, I don't know,
anything from, er...

11:48.840 --> 11:50.719
hating the way she looks,

11:50.720 --> 11:53.199
to her music,
to telling her to kill herself

11:53.200 --> 11:54.959
to threats of rape and...

11:54.960 --> 11:58.079
and murder,
but it's just, you know, noise.

11:58.080 --> 12:00.679
Did Gaia know about these threats?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.440
No, she wouldn't step on stage
if she knew.

12:05.480 --> 12:09.039
The person who shot Amber Tanaka
will be aware they made a mistake,

12:09.040 --> 12:12.080
and there may be another attempt
on Gaia's life.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.759
OK. Well, how long
till you catch him, then?

12:15.760 --> 12:17.319
Well, you can help us with that.

12:17.320 --> 12:20.159
We need access
to Gaia's social media accounts.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.759
We can see who made the threats.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.239
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Anna will sort that out for you.

12:24.240 --> 12:26.479
And I would suggest
that she stop performing,

12:26.480 --> 12:28.839
for the time being at least.
No.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.839
No, no, no. Absolutely not.

12:30.840 --> 12:33.439
Look...

12:33.440 --> 12:35.399
I have invested
a considerable amount

12:35.400 --> 12:36.839
into developing Gaia as an artist.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.720
This is her break-out moment.
I can't afford for her to hide away.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.040
The show must go on, right?

12:45.000 --> 12:47.760
Yeah.
Yeah, when it's costing a fortune.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.719
Most of the properties
on Gaia's street are rentals.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.079
They all have old-fashioned
entry systems,

12:58.080 --> 12:59.679
there's no CCTV coverage at all.

12:59.680 --> 13:01.439
Door-to-door yielded nothing.

13:01.440 --> 13:05.119
The gunshot woke people up,
but no-one saw the shooter escape.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.719
Early ballistics suggest
a 12 bore shotgun.

13:07.720 --> 13:10.039
Have the cartridges been recovered?
Yeah.

13:10.040 --> 13:12.799
See if they can provide print
or DNA evidence.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.479
No witnesses, generic gun.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.679
Could be professional?
I don't know.

13:17.680 --> 13:20.199
I mean, would a professional
leave cartridges behind?

13:20.200 --> 13:21.719
And fire at the wrong target?

13:21.720 --> 13:24.679
They didn't even wait
for the door to open properly.

13:24.680 --> 13:27.960
Now that sounds like...
That sounds like nerves to me.

13:39.120 --> 13:41.520
PIGS GRUNT

14:03.640 --> 14:06.719
Looks like a sheep bone.
Nothing to be bothered about.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.639
Right. Finish spreading
this lot out, and go home.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.400
OK.

14:12.360 --> 14:15.759
Back at six sharp tomorrow. Right?
Not half past like this morning.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.120
Course.

14:19.480 --> 14:21.040
PIGS GRUNT

14:33.760 --> 14:35.360
SHE EXHALES

14:36.600 --> 14:38.799
Er, police, please.

14:38.800 --> 14:43.080
Yeah, I-I'd like to report
the discovery of human remains.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.279
OFFICER: Tony. Fifth one along.

14:56.280 --> 15:00.400
DISTANT RADIO CHATTER

15:03.200 --> 15:06.039
Hello.
I wasn't expecting to see you here.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.239
Nadiuska got held up on another job,

15:08.240 --> 15:11.159
so she sent me
to collect the remains.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.759
But now I think
she knew what she'd be in for.

15:13.760 --> 15:16.399
Dead bodies I can cope with, but...

15:16.400 --> 15:18.879
..this smell...
Yeah.

15:18.880 --> 15:20.719
Yeah, I wish I'd just sent him now.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.239
Ha-ha... Look, the longer you talk,

15:23.240 --> 15:25.880
the longer we're here,
breathing it in, so can we, er...?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.679
This is it?

15:28.680 --> 15:30.839
Er, yeah.
Pigs have very powerful jaws,

15:30.840 --> 15:33.199
so they can grind through a femur,
no problem.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.000
The only thing
they're not too keen on is teeth.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.639
And, erm...

15:38.640 --> 15:40.679
And hair. They can't digest hair.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.320
This could be all that's left
of the victim.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.959
Sorry, I'm just gonna
get some fresh air.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.959
PIGS GRUNT

15:48.960 --> 15:50.760
DISTANT RADIO CHATTER

15:54.640 --> 15:56.000
Mr Stettner.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.120
I expect you want tea.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.359
We don't want to put you
to any trouble.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.519
You say that,
but I've got a yard full of coppers.

16:05.520 --> 16:08.319
Yes, well, we have just found
body parts in your pig shed.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.159
I don't know anything about that.

16:10.160 --> 16:12.639
Does anybody else work here?

16:12.640 --> 16:14.080
Not really.

16:15.640 --> 16:17.999
Ginny, the lass that called you.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.039
Who else has access to the farm?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.119
Well, anyone can walk
across the fields.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.159
There's a right of way,
I can't stop 'em, you know.

16:24.160 --> 16:26.279
Did you notice anything unusual
yesterday?

16:26.280 --> 16:28.519
I can't be everywhere at once,
can I?

16:28.520 --> 16:30.519
Do you have CCTV?

16:30.520 --> 16:32.599
CCTV?
HE SCOFFS

16:32.600 --> 16:33.960
It costs money.

16:34.960 --> 16:36.559
I used to have a guard dog, Loki,

16:36.560 --> 16:38.759
but now it's just me
and the animals, you know.

16:38.760 --> 16:41.440
SLURPING
Well, thanks for your help.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.399
Norman, take a look
at the mispers list,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.639
see if any of them wore dentures.

16:49.640 --> 16:52.359
Also contact all the local dentists,

16:52.360 --> 16:55.079
see if any of them
recognise the plate as their work.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.479
Mate...

16:56.480 --> 16:58.680
Would a new pair of shoes count
as an expense?

17:10.600 --> 17:11.879
KNOCK AT DOOR
Boss?

17:11.880 --> 17:14.560
The mispers with dentures.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.960
It's not a long list.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.039
Charles Spring.
Who's that?

17:23.040 --> 17:26.319
Pub landlord, 50,
missing since 2016.

17:26.320 --> 17:28.799
And he stands out because...?

17:28.800 --> 17:30.239
Because according to this,

17:30.240 --> 17:33.560
he ran a pub ten minutes
from Stettner's pig farm.

17:35.320 --> 17:39.559
OK, so, as well as
the Gaia shooting, we now have this.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.439
Charles Spring and his wife, Nicola,

17:42.440 --> 17:45.199
ran The Prince Edward pub
in Tillingley.

17:45.200 --> 17:47.519
He went missing in 2016.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.559
The local area was searched
at the time,

17:49.560 --> 17:50.959
but they found no trace of him.

17:50.960 --> 17:55.599
This article by Spinella speculates
that he might've taken his own life.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.799
Well, if that's the case,

17:56.800 --> 17:59.120
how did he end up in a pig sty
six years later?

18:00.520 --> 18:03.359
I want a fingertip search
of the entire farm,

18:03.360 --> 18:06.559
and I want to know everything
about James Stettner,

18:06.560 --> 18:07.799
including his financials.

18:07.800 --> 18:09.279
Financials?

18:09.280 --> 18:10.959
Yeah, h-he can't afford CCTV,

18:10.960 --> 18:12.600
yet he's got
a brand-new Range Rover.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.359
Gaia. There you are.
I've got good news.

18:18.360 --> 18:21.919
Spoke to Jamil from Pretty Machine,
and...

18:21.920 --> 18:23.479
he's willing
to replace Tank on drums.

18:23.480 --> 18:26.319
I'm not replacing Tank.
LARRY SCOFFS

18:26.320 --> 18:29.039
You've still got to rehearse, Gaia.
The tour begins next week.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.479
Yeah, well... I'm just...
I'm not going.

18:31.480 --> 18:32.879
Well, you...

18:32.880 --> 18:35.519
Everything's set.
It's all... It's all booked.

18:35.520 --> 18:37.680
Tank has been with me
since the beginning.

18:39.360 --> 18:41.239
I'm staying by her side
until she wakes up.

18:41.240 --> 18:42.600
Gaia...

18:43.760 --> 18:45.599
Tank got you this far, yeah?

18:45.600 --> 18:48.160
And you really wanna tell her
you threw everything away?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.400
This is
your once-in-a-lifetime chance.

18:53.440 --> 18:55.000
Look. Look...

18:56.080 --> 18:58.119
You go to LA.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.879
You join the tour, yeah?

18:59.880 --> 19:03.999
When Tank wakes up, she rejoins you
and enjoys the success.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.319
I really need
to think about this, Larry.

19:06.320 --> 19:08.559
I can guarantee your safety
over there.

19:08.560 --> 19:09.960
But here?

19:11.120 --> 19:13.000
You were the target.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.839
You wanted to see me, sir?

19:23.840 --> 19:25.839
You're making
all of the front pages.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.079
With both your investigations.

19:29.080 --> 19:32.879
I'm beginning to think that Spinella
will catch the killers before you.

19:32.880 --> 19:35.199
The leak is not coming from my team.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.519
Since you can't be objective,

19:37.520 --> 19:40.679
I've ordered a sweep
of all comms coming out of CID

19:40.680 --> 19:42.680
to see who's been in contact
with Spinella.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.840
Will that be all?
For now.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.399
Glenn.

19:49.400 --> 19:52.319
I'm gonna create
two separate enquiry teams,

19:52.320 --> 19:54.999
split the workload
so we don't get overwhelmed.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.719
I'll take the pig farm case,

19:56.720 --> 19:59.200
I want you to be SIO
on the shooting.

20:00.480 --> 20:01.520
Wait...

20:02.560 --> 20:04.239
Seriously?

20:04.240 --> 20:07.199
You'll be sanctioned
as a temporary Detective Inspector.

20:07.200 --> 20:11.640
Handle this well, and it could count
a lot towards your promotion.

20:13.040 --> 20:14.439
Thank you.

20:14.440 --> 20:17.639
OK, so, pick your team.
Who do you want with you?

20:17.640 --> 20:19.600
Ah...

20:21.680 --> 20:24.679
Bella.
OK, I'll let her know.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.519
Keep me in the loop.
I will.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.240
Absolutely.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.639
Norman?
Boss.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.079
You're with me,
for the pig farm enquiry.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.999
Bella, you'll be with Glenn
for the shooting.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.879
OK. Shall we?
Yeah.

20:41.880 --> 20:43.800
Looks like
someone's made the A team.

20:54.240 --> 20:58.119
I never have non-client visitors.
No-one's interested in accounting.

20:58.120 --> 21:00.199
Well, this is your lucky day, then,
Mr Whiteley.

21:00.200 --> 21:01.799
We're here to talk numbers.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.439
Your client, James Stettner.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.439
Runs a pig farm, near Tillingley.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.479
Yeah. Er, yeah,
I've filed for Mr Stettner

21:08.480 --> 21:09.919
for just over six years now.

21:09.920 --> 21:13.599
Have you noticed
any unusual activity?

21:13.600 --> 21:16.720
Er, money that
might've appeared suddenly?

21:17.760 --> 21:19.880
You mean the 60,000?

21:20.880 --> 21:23.559
Yes. Yes, where did that come from?

21:23.560 --> 21:25.640
Er, Mr Stettner
sold off his woodland.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.439
And bought a new car.
That's right.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.359
Erm, he needed it
to haul his trailers.

21:34.360 --> 21:35.879
I can assure you that Mr Stettner

21:35.880 --> 21:37.679
has done everything by the book
since 2016.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.119
Cos he wouldn't want HMRC
looking into him again...

21:40.120 --> 21:41.720
Right, and what was he up to
in 2016?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.960
It's a simple enough question,
isn't it?

21:46.920 --> 21:48.959
Well, we don't wanna lose
Mr Stettner as a client,

21:48.960 --> 21:50.920
so that's for him to tell you,
if he wants to.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.839
NORMAN SIGHS
OK. Well...

21:55.840 --> 21:57.959
Thanks for your time, Mr Whiteley.

21:57.960 --> 21:59.559
That your son?

21:59.560 --> 22:01.639
Er... Yeah.

22:01.640 --> 22:04.959
Yeah. Don't get to see him
as much as I'd like to.

22:04.960 --> 22:06.479
How come?

22:06.480 --> 22:08.119
Er, his mother won't let me.

22:08.120 --> 22:09.799
Well, you know
there's things you can do,

22:09.800 --> 22:11.959
that's why
we have the family courts.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.359
Get help. You should try it.
I don't think Mr Whiteley needs

22:14.360 --> 22:16.040
our advice on personal matters,
Norman.

22:17.040 --> 22:19.999
Yeah. Sorry about that. It's just...

22:20.000 --> 22:24.120
I never saw my dad much growing up,
so things like that strike a chord.

22:25.360 --> 22:27.080
PHONE RINGS

22:30.960 --> 22:32.839
Anna has sent through
all the negative content

22:32.840 --> 22:34.999
that was deleted
from Gaia's social media.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.880
And there's a lot of it.

23:26.960 --> 23:28.519
Hey, guys.

23:28.520 --> 23:31.200
I've got a song for you.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.999
# She's not what you think

23:36.000 --> 23:38.079
# She's not what you believe

23:38.080 --> 23:40.039
# She's a girl with many faces

23:40.040 --> 23:42.439
# She's nothing but a thief

23:42.440 --> 23:44.999
# Gaia is a fraud

23:45.000 --> 23:48.999
# Is a fraud, is a liar

23:49.000 --> 23:50.679
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

23:50.680 --> 23:52.920
# Gaia isn't real. #

23:55.640 --> 23:56.840
Bella.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.759
Ninety-nine percent of Gaia's trolls

24:02.760 --> 24:04.839
are hating on other celebrities
and bands, right?

24:04.840 --> 24:07.239
Except for Real Singer Drayton.

24:07.240 --> 24:10.439
She's only seems to be interested
in calling Gaia a thief.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.160
What did Gaia steal from her?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.760
I don't know. But let's go find out.

24:34.720 --> 24:38.319
You were investigated by HMRC
in 2016.

24:38.320 --> 24:39.999
Why?

24:40.000 --> 24:41.319
Why?

24:41.320 --> 24:44.039
Cos some fella turned up, said
he wanted to rent two of my barns.

24:44.040 --> 24:46.959
Y'know, I... I thought, "Why not?"

24:46.960 --> 24:48.919
Money's tight, they're sitting idle.

24:48.920 --> 24:50.319
And then...

24:50.320 --> 24:52.199
Next thing I know,
there's... there's vans

24:52.200 --> 24:55.759
driving up and down the track
at all hours, making my dog bark.

24:55.760 --> 24:58.039
So one night,
I goes down to have a look,

24:58.040 --> 24:59.599
see what they were up to.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.999
What did you find?
The barns were...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.479
They were filled with cigarettes.
No tax on them, so...

25:04.480 --> 25:06.199
So I told the fella
he had to get off my land.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.960
Right. Then what happened?

25:09.360 --> 25:11.559
I found Loki.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.919
My dog, he was...
He was out in the yard.

25:13.920 --> 25:15.160
He'd been shot in the head.

25:16.640 --> 25:18.440
The bastard put a cigarette
in his mouth.

25:19.920 --> 25:23.559
Did you know the landlord
of The Prince Edward?

25:23.560 --> 25:27.479
Charles Spring?
Yeah, it used to be my local.

25:27.480 --> 25:30.839
What can you tell us about him?
Charles?

25:30.840 --> 25:32.959
He was an arse.

25:32.960 --> 25:35.759
You know, he... He fancied himself
a bit of a gangster.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.919
He was shifting the cigarettes
through his pub

25:37.920 --> 25:39.959
even though I warned him not to.

25:39.960 --> 25:42.359
Then Charles, he went missing.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.199
Did you report any of this
to the police?

25:44.200 --> 25:46.879
Police. You're on your own out here.

25:46.880 --> 25:49.119
You know, that's the way of it.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.519
It was a relief when HMRC turned up.

25:51.520 --> 25:53.560
Well, cos at least
it sent him packing.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.239
The man who rented the barns,
Mr Stettner.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.639
Can you give me a name?

25:58.640 --> 26:00.319
Yeah.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.400
Alvin. Alvin Smallbone.

26:04.720 --> 26:06.280
Thanks for your help.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.239
I put Alvin Smallbone away
about six years ago.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.799
Hm? What for?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.519
GBH on two bouncers.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.400
One of them had to drink his food
through a straw for a few months.

26:19.920 --> 26:22.239
When he went down,
he shouted across the courtroom

26:22.240 --> 26:25.679
that if he ever saw me again,
he'd put me in the ground.

26:25.680 --> 26:28.040
Let me guess.
You want to go see him.

26:54.520 --> 26:57.799
Drayton Wheeler is a Brighton-based
singer/songwriter.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.639
She plays the pubs and busks,
but she's not making it.

27:00.640 --> 27:02.919
All of her social media
for the past year

27:02.920 --> 27:05.359
has just been her accusing Gaia
of being a thief.

27:05.360 --> 27:06.959
What did she think Gaia stole?

27:06.960 --> 27:08.719
A song called Peaches.

27:08.720 --> 27:10.479
Did she?

27:10.480 --> 27:14.079
I don't know. This beef has been
going on for... two years?

27:14.080 --> 27:15.640
Before my time.

27:18.640 --> 27:19.760
Think you should see this.

27:21.280 --> 27:24.719
SHE SIGHS
It was posted a couple of hours ago.

27:24.720 --> 27:26.639
SECURITY GUARD ON RECORDING:
Sold out, babe.

27:26.640 --> 27:28.039
DRAYTON: I need to get in.

27:28.040 --> 27:30.199
They're giving their money
to a thief!

27:30.200 --> 27:32.919
I need to let them know the truth.
Step away now!

27:32.920 --> 27:34.359
This was the night of the shooting.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.919
GUARD: Stay still!

27:35.920 --> 27:37.559
Drayton's been angry for so long,

27:37.560 --> 27:40.839
we all just stopped...
paying attention.

27:40.840 --> 27:42.640
DRAYTON SHOUTS

27:50.760 --> 27:52.120
Spoke to East Sussex Prison.

27:53.120 --> 27:55.400
Smallbone was released
under licence on Friday.

27:57.200 --> 28:00.680
Well, let's find out who
his supervising officer is. Boss.

28:12.760 --> 28:13.960
The comms are clean.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.879
Well, that's reassuring.
Hardly.

28:18.880 --> 28:22.080
It means whoever is leaking
to Spinella is doing it in person.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.440
No-one is ruled out.

You're late.
Sorry. I had a thing I needed to do.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.199
Why are we here, not at the office?

28:56.200 --> 28:58.959
Office ain't the safest place
for me right now.

28:58.960 --> 29:00.759
Tell me about numbers.

29:00.760 --> 29:03.799
Well, um, Gaia's picked up a
significant number of new followers,

29:03.800 --> 29:06.719
and we're seeing a big uptick
on plays of Poison Lover.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.399
She was trending online yesterday,

29:08.400 --> 29:11.359
and her engagement's gone up
like 300%.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.439
People are really into this story
of the shooting.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.679
Good news! Good news, finally.
HE LAUGHS

29:17.680 --> 29:19.919
Yeah, but it won't last.

29:19.920 --> 29:23.119
Without new content,
this story's going to get old. Fast.

29:23.120 --> 29:24.599
It only happened four days ago.

29:24.600 --> 29:26.560
Yeah, that's a lifetime
on social media, Larry.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.639
If... you really want this
to blow up,

29:30.640 --> 29:32.719
you're going to need to drop a bomb.

29:32.720 --> 29:35.160
What bomb? I haven't got any bombs.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.880
Gaia's super secretive
about who Roan's dad is.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.919
Could be something juicy there.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.960
HE SIGHS
Ah, no, it's a dead end. Dead end.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.080
No way she'll let us
involve that kid.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.640

I hope you're going to the bank
to get my money, Larry.

30:13.080 --> 30:16.239
HE SIGHS
Alvin. Um...

30:16.240 --> 30:18.440
Been tryna call ya.
No, you haven't.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.879
Just give me a couple of weeks,
yeah?

30:21.880 --> 30:23.159
Nice try, Larry.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.119
But I know you're going to LA
on Friday.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.879
That's not definite.
ALVIN LAUGHS

30:28.880 --> 30:30.680
ALVIN SIGHS

30:32.280 --> 30:34.040
You've got to ask yourself
something.

30:35.680 --> 30:39.039
Did Gaia's shooter make a mistake,

30:39.040 --> 30:42.280
or... was it a warning?

30:50.240 --> 30:51.360
HE SIGHS

30:58.560 --> 31:02.319
# I tried my hardest to please you

31:02.320 --> 31:06.359
# And all I got was an empty space

31:06.360 --> 31:08.959
# You hold me like a possession

31:08.960 --> 31:11.959
# But I'm not yours, not yours

31:18.440 --> 31:21.319
Sorry to interrupt.

31:21.320 --> 31:23.399
Can we speak privately?

31:23.400 --> 31:24.640
Take a break, guys.

31:34.640 --> 31:37.119
What can you tell us
about Drayton Wheeler?

31:37.120 --> 31:38.439
Drayton?

31:38.440 --> 31:42.239
Well, she's a singer, like me.
She's... She's good.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.760
She says you stole her song.

31:45.840 --> 31:47.479
When I first started
working with Larry,

31:47.480 --> 31:50.839
he brought me this song
called Peaches.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.879
I really liked the melody,
so I reworked the lyrics.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.959
Made it my own.

31:54.960 --> 31:57.159
And it became Poison Lover?

31:57.160 --> 32:00.680
Then Drayton started accusing me
of stealing her song, so...

32:01.720 --> 32:03.479
..I asked Larry about it,

32:03.480 --> 32:07.599
and he admitted that he'd heard
Drayton busking and recorded her.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.759
That's how he got Peaches.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.919
What, he stole it?

32:10.920 --> 32:13.319
I-I didn't know at the time.

32:13.320 --> 32:15.719
And when I found out,
I wanted to give it back,

32:15.720 --> 32:19.519
but Larry said it was too late
and that telling the truth would...

32:19.520 --> 32:21.319
SHE SIGHS
..ruin my image.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.120
He wouldn't even let me
say sorry to Drayton.

32:24.640 --> 32:27.199
BANGING ON DOOR
Drayton?

32:27.200 --> 32:28.240

32:29.840 --> 32:33.079

Drayton!

32:33.080 --> 32:34.839
Drayton, open up. Police.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.399
We won't have any luck.

32:36.400 --> 32:38.559
Drayton's neighbour says
she's been gone a few days.

32:38.560 --> 32:40.479
She's been looking after her cat.

32:40.480 --> 32:42.639
Right, well,
does she know where she's gone? No.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.279
But she says
Drayton didn't seem well in herself.

32:45.280 --> 32:48.200
SIRENS WAIL,
HE SIGHS

32:52.120 --> 32:53.359
We've been in touch with

32:53.360 --> 32:55.199
Alvin Smallbone's
supervising officer,

32:55.200 --> 32:57.759
and Alvin has not checked in
since his release.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.119
He's broken
the conditions of his licence, then.

33:00.120 --> 33:03.279
Which gives us grounds for arrest.

33:03.280 --> 33:08.359
So, here's a list of his
known haunts,

33:08.360 --> 33:10.320
previous addresses...

33:11.360 --> 33:13.040
..associates, etcetera.

33:14.080 --> 33:17.319
And you will notice
that we're looking at locations

33:17.320 --> 33:19.919
in Brighton, Eastbourne,
Hailsham and Hastings.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.399
There's plenty of rocks he could
have crawled under then, eh?

33:22.400 --> 33:27.119
Exactly. Oh, and his party trick
is breaking fingers,

33:27.120 --> 33:31.159
so let's keep an eye on A&E
for potential victims.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.880
DOOR OPENS

33:40.200 --> 33:43.680
Ah. You, uh... You beat me to it.

33:44.960 --> 33:50.679
The estate agent has lined up
a few viewings for this week, so...

33:50.680 --> 33:52.839
Right. Uh...

33:52.840 --> 33:56.559
Look, I... I will keep things tidy,
OK? I promise.

33:56.560 --> 33:58.520
Thanks.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.960
How's the case going?

34:08.200 --> 34:09.999
Great.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.760
Apart from the fact that
Drayton Wheeler has disappeared.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.800
So has Alvin Smallbone.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.000
I'm just worried I'm...
I'm missing something.

34:21.320 --> 34:25.879
ROY SIGHS
Have you updated PNC?

34:25.880 --> 34:28.479
Yep.
ANPR? Mm-hm.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.239
Applied for permission
to track her accounts?

34:31.240 --> 34:34.240
Yeah. And I've notified airports
and Border Force.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.040
Then you have covered all the bases.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.239
ROY SIGHS

34:40.240 --> 34:42.280
So, what's up? Talk to me.

34:44.760 --> 34:45.880
Ari called.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.360
She says she wants to meet up
and talk things through.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.640
Well, that's progress, isn't it?
Mm.

34:57.440 --> 35:00.319
Look, how can I promise her that
I'm gonna be there for the family

35:00.320 --> 35:04.799
and put them first
when I'm chasing a promotion

35:04.800 --> 35:06.239
and more responsibility?

35:06.240 --> 35:10.799
Look... I have less time now
than I did before.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.120
Yeah, I hear you.

35:13.080 --> 35:15.360
I could never get the balance right
when I was with Sandy.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.079
And now?

35:18.080 --> 35:19.879
I try and do better.

35:19.880 --> 35:22.200
When I'm with Cleo,
my focus is on her.

35:24.480 --> 35:27.080

37:17.960 --> 37:20.399
Body parts being found
all over the South Downs.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.399
I can't believe people
want to live in the countryside.

37:23.400 --> 37:26.239
The pig farm's about a mile away
from here.

37:26.240 --> 37:28.839
Charles Spring's old pub
is walking distance,

37:28.840 --> 37:30.080
down that track.

37:31.400 --> 37:33.839
Well, if that is Charles,

37:33.840 --> 37:36.359
he's being scattered all around
his back yard.

37:36.360 --> 37:39.239
These dumps sites
aren't just convenient.

37:39.240 --> 37:41.920
They mean something to the killer.

37:42.880 --> 37:44.080
It's a message.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.720
Right, and the message is...

37:48.520 --> 37:50.600
Something petty. Spiteful.

37:53.200 --> 37:56.520
It could be a last laugh
from Alvin Smallbone.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.160
We need to find him.

38:30.840 --> 38:33.679
Gaia's doing well, isn't she?

38:33.680 --> 38:35.200
It's a catchy tune.

38:38.760 --> 38:41.399
Money must be pouring in.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.440
No, it doesn't...
doesn't work like that.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.039
Bullshit.

38:46.040 --> 38:49.599
Look, internet fame
isn't the same as income.

38:49.600 --> 38:51.399
I mean, yeah,
she looks successful online,

38:51.400 --> 38:53.039
but it hasn't translated
into cash yet.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.119
That's why we need this deal in LA.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.680
You know, she, er...
She needs the tour.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.000
Where's all my money gone, Larry?

39:03.440 --> 39:06.200
Erm, promotions...

39:07.680 --> 39:09.559
..venue hire, rehearsal time.

39:09.560 --> 39:12.560
I mean, everything costs a fortune,
mate.

39:13.960 --> 39:17.039
But you will get your money back,
I promise.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.720
This is the long game Alvin,
you know, just gotta be patient.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.399
I'm done being patient
with you, Larry.

39:27.400 --> 39:29.240
No, no, no!

39:30.320 --> 39:33.599
The marks on the bone suggest
the dismemberment was a struggle.

39:33.600 --> 39:36.879
Loads of different attempts
to saw through the bone.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.039
So he was in a hurry?

39:38.040 --> 39:41.239
Yes, because the limb
was also poorly packaged.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.639
You can see evidence of freezer burn
on the flesh

39:43.640 --> 39:45.239
where the skin was exposed.

39:45.240 --> 39:47.399
Freezer burn?

39:47.400 --> 39:49.999
The arm was frozen before
it was disposed of in the lake.

39:50.000 --> 39:54.919
In a freezer, the water inside
of the body migrates to the surface

39:54.920 --> 39:56.639
and becomes ice crystals,

39:56.640 --> 39:59.319
then they evaporate
through sublimation,

39:59.320 --> 40:01.399
leaving these grey spots.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.839
It happens if the freezer
is not cold enough,

40:03.840 --> 40:05.919
if it's too full, for example.

40:05.920 --> 40:08.519
Which it would be
if there was a corpse inside it.

40:08.520 --> 40:10.879
How long was it in the freezer,
do you think?

40:10.880 --> 40:12.799
Hard to say.

40:12.800 --> 40:17.079
So Alvin kills Charles Spring,
all right,

40:17.080 --> 40:19.479
but he doesn't have enough time
to dispose of the body parts

40:19.480 --> 40:20.559
before he gets sent down.

40:20.560 --> 40:23.479
So he bungs the rest
in cold storage,

40:23.480 --> 40:24.799
pops it on his to-do list.

40:24.800 --> 40:29.119
After he gets out,
he picks up where he left off,

40:29.120 --> 40:31.959
chucking the body parts
within shouting distance of the pub

40:31.960 --> 40:33.599
as a final insult.

40:33.600 --> 40:36.599
If this is Spring.
We still don't know yet.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.080
DNA will take a while.

40:39.120 --> 40:41.759
We also found this.

40:41.760 --> 40:44.360
It was inside the plastic wrapping
with the arm.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.199
Part of a sleeve maybe?

40:48.200 --> 40:51.879
Wool and silk -
most likely a suit material.

40:51.880 --> 40:53.359
Very loud suit.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.200
Pink and red checks.

40:58.800 --> 41:01.479
Let's talk to Charles Spring's wife,
Nicola.

41:01.480 --> 41:04.279
See if she remembers him wearing
a pink and red suit.

41:04.280 --> 41:06.760
Well, it's not something
you'd forget.

41:12.520 --> 41:17.639
When we got married, I knew that
I was in it for the long haul.

41:17.640 --> 41:21.439
I made a commitment
to you and the kids

41:21.440 --> 41:23.800
that this would be a stable home.

41:26.120 --> 41:28.520
I promised that I'd put in the work.

41:32.160 --> 41:34.560
Somewhere along the line, I...

41:36.520 --> 41:38.800
..I stopped putting you
and the kids first.

41:41.320 --> 41:45.080
I forgot that you had dreams
and ambitions, too.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.279
It did feel like I was the only one
making sacrifices.

41:52.280 --> 41:54.439
Yeah. I...

41:54.440 --> 41:58.080
I see that now. I get it.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.560
I get why you felt alone.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.080
I never stopped loving you.

42:08.560 --> 42:11.560
You need to know that.
Ari, I never stopped loving you.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.200
You can forgive me?

42:17.120 --> 42:18.879
Yeah.

42:18.880 --> 42:20.200
Yes.

42:23.800 --> 42:25.680
SECURITY GUARD: I think that's her.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.200
Nicola Spring?

42:43.920 --> 42:47.079
I'm Detective Superintendent
Roy Grace.

42:47.080 --> 42:50.999
I need to ask you some questions
about your husband, Charles.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.800
About a suit he might have worn.

42:59.560 --> 43:00.959
Get this woman an ambulance

43:00.960 --> 43:03.719
and let me know
when she's fit to talk. Yes, sir.

43:03.720 --> 43:06.279
She won't be much help for a while.

43:06.280 --> 43:10.079
I'm gonna call Glenn,
ask him if he knows any tailors.

43:10.080 --> 43:12.159
What? No! No, no.

43:12.160 --> 43:13.959
He's a measures man... at best.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.879
You wanna ask me,
I'm bespoke these days.

43:16.880 --> 43:18.399
You?
Yeah.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.719
Look, everything you see
on this suit -

43:20.720 --> 43:23.879
the button stance, the vents,
the lining -

43:23.880 --> 43:26.039
it's all exclusive to this suit.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.079
Can't believe you didn't notice.

43:28.080 --> 43:32.560
We're obviously paying you too much.
Hey, every man has his priorities.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.400
No.

43:38.440 --> 43:40.639
HE SIGHS
Come on, Gaia, help me out here.

43:40.640 --> 43:44.399
I'm not naming Roan's father
to get more likes on the Internet!

43:44.400 --> 43:47.679
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.279
Look, you're a teenage single mum.
Yeah? It's relatable.

43:50.280 --> 43:53.039
You'll get more plays. More money.

43:53.040 --> 43:55.560
No. It was traumatic.

43:56.720 --> 43:58.240
DOOR OPENS
AND CLOSES

44:00.920 --> 44:02.560
Sorry. Bad time?

44:03.800 --> 44:07.280
It's always a good time for food.
Yeah. I'll help you.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.680
SOFTLY: Take it.

44:20.720 --> 44:24.120
Oh, I'm too angry to eat.
I'll have it later.

44:36.080 --> 44:38.679
Would you consider her a fit parent?

44:38.680 --> 44:40.919
It's not a safe environment
for a child, is it?

44:40.920 --> 44:42.760
It's not for me to judge.

44:52.680 --> 44:54.160
Yep, hello.

44:55.520 --> 44:59.839
I'd like to speak to a solicitor
about getting access to my son.

44:59.840 --> 45:01.560
Yeah, I'll hold.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.799
We've found Drayton.

45:06.800 --> 45:07.919
Where is she?

45:07.920 --> 45:09.919
She used her bank card
at a hardware store.

45:09.920 --> 45:12.919
Now we've located her on CCTV
heading down West Street.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.400
That's near Brooker's office.

45:22.800 --> 45:26.239
Mr Potting,
how nice to see you again.

45:26.240 --> 45:27.839
Tyler, how are ya?

45:27.840 --> 45:31.679
This is my boss,
Detective Superintendent Roy Grace.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.839
Oh, I'm so glad Mr Potting
finally persuaded you to go bespoke.

45:35.840 --> 45:39.319
He hasn't.
I'm fine with off-the-peg.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.200
Do you recognise this fabric?

45:42.600 --> 45:47.119
Mm. That is a Coppersilk pink
and red check jacketing fabric

45:47.120 --> 45:48.159
by Marlowe & Fuller.

45:48.160 --> 45:51.639
It's very nice, indeed.
I remember it well.

45:51.640 --> 45:55.519
We made a suit for Gideon Reece
for his wedding to Samuel Clark.

45:55.520 --> 45:57.799
You know, Gideon and Sam?

45:57.800 --> 46:01.359
Of Bryson Fine Art Gallery?

46:01.360 --> 46:04.360
It was quite an event.
The suit looked amazing.

46:17.280 --> 46:19.560
Hm. Don't you agree?

46:23.680 --> 46:24.720
Mmm.

46:27.040 --> 46:31.960
And this would be a one-off piece?
Oh, very much so. Iconic.

46:33.400 --> 46:34.960
Interesting. Thank you.

46:36.240 --> 46:39.839
Oh. This might seem like
a strange question,

46:39.840 --> 46:43.880
but have you any idea whether
Gideon Reece wears dentures?

46:45.080 --> 46:46.719
Well...

46:46.720 --> 46:49.159
I don't know about that,

46:49.160 --> 46:53.839
but, er, I do know he went to Turkey
to got veneers done on the cheap.

46:53.840 --> 46:57.080
They say he lights up a room
when he talks now.

47:12.400 --> 47:13.839
I can't see her anywhere.

47:13.840 --> 47:16.080
Well, the CCTV saw her come in.

47:19.080 --> 47:20.839
There!

47:20.840 --> 47:22.919
THEY GRUNT

47:22.920 --> 47:24.720
METAL PIPE CLATTERS

47:26.800 --> 47:28.999
Drayton! Police, stop!

47:29.000 --> 47:30.959
Get your hands off him!

47:30.960 --> 47:34.399
Hey, get off him.
Hands off!

47:34.400 --> 47:37.279
He stole my song.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.639
He stole money from charity!

47:39.640 --> 47:41.599
Calm down. Calm down!

47:41.600 --> 47:43.479
Yeah? What money?

47:43.480 --> 47:45.759
He got all his acts
to sell off their gear

47:45.760 --> 47:50.039
in an auction for charity,
and then he kept it all for himself.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.680
He's the guilty one.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.720
ENGINE STARTS

48:03.960 --> 48:07.439
You OK? You wanna get
checked over in hospital?

48:07.440 --> 48:09.840
Nah. Bit shocked, but I'm fine.

48:11.040 --> 48:13.119
What happened to your hand?

48:13.120 --> 48:16.680
Nothing, just, er,
trapped it in the car door.

48:20.000 --> 48:21.119
KNOCK ON DOOR

48:21.120 --> 48:24.119
Ah. Now,
I've tracked down Gideon Reece,

48:24.120 --> 48:26.719
who is very much alive

48:26.720 --> 48:29.879
and surprised that
we're asking about his suit.

48:29.880 --> 48:34.079
Did he explain why part of it
ended up with a dismembered body?

48:34.080 --> 48:37.839
No. He just said after the wedding,
he put on a few pounds,

48:37.840 --> 48:40.279
it didn't fit,
so he decided to sell it.

48:40.280 --> 48:42.839
That was two years ago.
Who did he sell it to?

48:42.840 --> 48:45.359
Just a vintage reseller
in North Laine.

48:45.360 --> 48:48.519
Let me guess, the shop has no idea
who bought the suit.

48:48.520 --> 48:49.879
MOBILE VIBRATES
No.

48:49.880 --> 48:51.560
They encourage cash buyers.

48:54.200 --> 48:57.440
You OK?
Yeah. Yeah.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.239
I'll be an hour.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.760
Boss.

49:15.480 --> 49:18.040
Where's Norman off to?
Didn't say.

49:58.200 --> 50:00.720
Fancy seeing you here.
I got you a present.

50:03.040 --> 50:06.000
Don't get excited.
OK, I won't.

50:10.520 --> 50:11.679
You shouldn't have.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.560
I know, but I did.
Cos I'm thoughtful and I'm kind.

50:37.480 --> 50:39.879
I hear you found Drayton Wheeler.

50:39.880 --> 50:40.999
Yeah, well,

50:41.000 --> 50:43.399
the search of Drayton's flat
didn't turn up a shotgun.

50:43.400 --> 50:45.759
We did find her clothes
from the night of the shooting

50:45.760 --> 50:47.079
and sent that off for analysis,

50:47.080 --> 50:50.759
but initial swabs have come back
negative for gunpowder residue,

50:50.760 --> 50:53.399
so I'm not holding out
too much hope there.

50:53.400 --> 50:57.039
OK. Anything else?

50:57.040 --> 50:59.439
Well, we've been looking
into Larry Brooker.

50:59.440 --> 51:01.639
So, he has a string
of collapsed companies,

51:01.640 --> 51:05.519
his credit rating is terrible,
and he has A LOT of unpaid debt.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.799
He's got fancy offices
and a glitzy lifestyle,

51:08.800 --> 51:10.119
but it's all a lie.

51:10.120 --> 51:12.439
I mean, Brooker is on the verge
of another bankruptcy.

51:12.440 --> 51:15.400
He's also got a lot
of broken fingers.

51:16.320 --> 51:19.560
Debt... and broken fingers?

51:21.400 --> 51:22.880
What're you thinking?

51:26.680 --> 51:29.999
I'm thinking... there's a line...

51:30.000 --> 51:34.359
that... goes from
Stettner's pig farm

51:34.360 --> 51:37.159
to Alvin Smallbone...

51:37.160 --> 51:43.159
via the broken fingers,
to Larry Brooker, to the shooting...

51:43.160 --> 51:47.640
all the way down to...

51:52.880 --> 51:55.759
..this suit. Have we got
a bigger picture of this suit?

51:55.760 --> 51:57.480
Er, yeah.

52:07.920 --> 52:09.360
That's Gideon Reece's suit.

52:11.000 --> 52:14.080
That was sold at a vintage shop.
To Gaia.

52:15.360 --> 52:17.600
Bring the whiteboards together.

52:20.920 --> 52:24.159
So, Brooker made his artists
take part in a charity auction

52:24.160 --> 52:26.879
to raise funds
for a musicians' charity.

52:26.880 --> 52:29.679
Yeah, but that was a scam.
The charity confirmed to me

52:29.680 --> 52:32.559
they never received any donations
from Larry.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.799
So who was the highest bidder
on the suit?

52:34.800 --> 52:38.399
Er... Myles Royce.
Well, that tracks.

52:38.400 --> 52:41.239
Bella and I have seen thousands
of his posts about her.

52:41.240 --> 52:44.120
He is Gaia's number one fan.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.759
Yeah, course I remember it.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.279
It was gorgeous.

52:54.280 --> 52:58.199
I bought it in a vintage shop
about a year ago, but I...

52:58.200 --> 53:01.800
I only wore it on stage once.
The dry cleaning cost a fortune.

53:02.960 --> 53:05.439
Myles Royce won it in an auction.

53:05.440 --> 53:08.399
Yeah, I couldn't think
of a better home for it.

53:08.400 --> 53:10.319
He's a big fan of your, isn't he?

53:10.320 --> 53:11.800
Yeah, massive fan.

53:13.320 --> 53:18.359
He used to write me these...
beautiful handwritten letters.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.999
Then we became friends.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.119
This might seem like
an odd question,

53:22.120 --> 53:24.799
but, erm, did Myles wear dentures?

53:24.800 --> 53:27.600
Yeah, because he has anodontia.

53:30.480 --> 53:33.720
What's that?
It's where you don't form teeth.

53:35.680 --> 53:39.839
He had to wear dentures to school.
Can you imagine?

53:39.840 --> 53:42.400
The kids just...
just put him through hell.

53:46.640 --> 53:51.799
OK, the human remains
recovered from the pig farm

53:51.800 --> 53:56.039
and the fishing lake
belonged to Myles Royce.

53:56.040 --> 53:59.959
The fabric we found with
the severed arm is from Gaia's suit,

53:59.960 --> 54:01.559
which he bought at auction,

54:01.560 --> 54:03.919
and the dentures
have been positively identified

54:03.920 --> 54:06.999
as being from a plate made for him.
Now, hang on.

54:07.000 --> 54:11.439
Myles Royce was posting comments
and memes about Gaia

54:11.440 --> 54:12.639
up until yesterday.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.560
That doesn't make sense.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.720
So is he alive or dead?

54:40.880 --> 54:41.920
BUZZER

54:45.040 --> 54:47.159
Ah, finally.

54:47.160 --> 54:49.079
Are you the council?
About the noise, right?

54:49.080 --> 54:51.599
Noise?
Myles's noise.

54:51.600 --> 54:54.799
Horrible man.
Always playing his music, so loud.

54:54.800 --> 54:57.919
I tell him I have to use
the subtitles when I watch TV,

54:57.920 --> 54:59.799
he's so loud, but he doesn't care.

54:59.800 --> 55:01.519
Must have been quiet recently,
though?

55:01.520 --> 55:03.079
What are you talking about?

55:03.080 --> 55:05.479
It was so loud last night
I had to bang on the ceiling!

55:05.480 --> 55:08.039
I called you, the council.
We're... We're not the council.

55:08.040 --> 55:10.479
Wait, Myles was here last night?

55:10.480 --> 55:13.800
He's not here now,
but he's here every night.

55:16.960 --> 55:18.319
Have you seen him?

55:18.320 --> 55:21.120
His long coat and silly hat.
Of course I've seen him!

55:23.000 --> 55:27.240
Ah. You're the police, ah?
You've come to arrest him.

55:38.040 --> 55:42.599
Cassian's been on my case
about finding the mole in CID.

55:42.600 --> 55:43.800
Right.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.640
Who do you think it is?

55:49.320 --> 55:51.319
Well, at first,
I thought it was Norman.

55:51.320 --> 55:52.959
Norman?

55:52.960 --> 55:56.839
What, you seriously think
he'd take a bung from Spinella?

55:56.840 --> 55:59.240
Have you seen the suits
he's been wearing lately?

56:00.720 --> 56:02.080
Anyway, I followed him.

56:03.760 --> 56:05.240
He met Spinella?

56:08.080 --> 56:10.319
No.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.439
Well, go on, then.

56:12.440 --> 56:14.360
Don't keep me hanging, Roy.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.319
Norman and Bella...

56:19.320 --> 56:20.519
they're an item.

56:20.520 --> 56:22.279
No. No!

56:22.280 --> 56:23.439
Yeah!

56:23.440 --> 56:27.399
THEY CHUCKLE

56:27.400 --> 56:31.319
She's been getting texts messages
and giggling like a school girl!

56:31.320 --> 56:34.519
THEY LAUGH

56:34.520 --> 56:36.439
I don't normally like being wrong,

56:36.440 --> 56:38.360
but in this case
I couldn't be happier.

56:39.800 --> 56:40.840
Wow.

56:42.320 --> 56:45.160
Who's the leak, then?
If it's not one of us...

56:46.240 --> 56:49.079
Well, it's not one of us...

56:49.080 --> 56:51.280
but still,
the information gets out.

56:57.080 --> 56:59.560
And it's... It's specific.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.880
It's confidential.
Look.

57:05.880 --> 57:07.840
Long coat, hat.

57:09.520 --> 57:12.040
Myles Royce! Police!

57:19.520 --> 57:21.480
Myles, stop.

57:30.960 --> 57:32.440
What the..?

57:41.760 --> 57:44.600
FOOTSTEPS,
BANGING

57:46.280 --> 57:48.640
You go after him. I'll cut him off.

57:52.720 --> 57:54.000
HE GRUNTS

58:01.120 --> 58:03.880
CRASHING,
DOG BARKS

58:12.240 --> 58:13.320
Police!

58:20.520 --> 58:22.400
THEY PANT

59:07.120 --> 59:10.159
Myles Royce is definitely dead.

59:10.160 --> 59:13.639
It looks like the killer's been
keeping him alive on social media...

59:13.640 --> 59:15.759
for months.

59:15.760 --> 59:20.080
Must have gone into Myles's photos
and videos to create new content.

59:22.400 --> 59:24.239
Is there anything here
that might connect him

59:24.240 --> 59:27.519
to Alvin Smallbone
or Charles Spring?

59:27.520 --> 59:30.000
Nah, there's nothing I can find.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.639
HE SIGHS

59:33.640 --> 59:36.080
The closer we get,
the less it makes sense.

59:37.880 --> 59:42.320
Who's has been impersonating
Miles Royce, and why?

59:55.120 --> 59:56.999
You were right.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.119
You had a tracking device
hidden in your car.

59:59.120 --> 1:00:00.679
When triggered by speech,

1:00:00.680 --> 1:00:03.039
it calls a number
specified by the user,

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:05.120
who can then eavesdrop
on their phone.

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:08.520
Who was listening to me?

1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:19.159
How do I get this working again?

1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:21.199
You just put the SIM card
back in it.

1:00:21.200 --> 1:00:23.199
But if you do that,
he will hear everything.

1:00:23.200 --> 1:00:24.799
Good.

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:26.120
I want him to.

1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:40.160
BIRDSONG

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:00.360
Hey.

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:03.720
I hear you found another body.

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:07.480
One of Gaia's band. Was it Tunde?

1:01:08.920 --> 1:01:10.559
Was this another shooting...

1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:13.040
or was he chopped up
like Myles Royce?

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:18.079
Do you know what?

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:21.440
It doesn't matter.
I always find out, anyway.

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:24.879
Not today.

1:01:24.880 --> 1:01:26.560
Thanks, you can go.

1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:30.639
Is this a prank?

1:01:30.640 --> 1:01:34.679
I wouldn't call
bugging my car a prank.

1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:36.919
Oh, come on, Roy!

1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:40.439
Two years in prison.
Guys...

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:42.919
When you think about it,
we're colleagues, really.

1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:45.439
Scratching each other's backs.
Helping each other out.

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:47.120
I don't need your help.

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:52.239
You can't do this to me. You can't!
Can't I?

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:55.439
I know that you're very interested
in what happened to Charles Spring,

1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:57.520
and I can...
I can help you with that.

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.400
What do you know?

1:02:02.240 --> 1:02:05.639
Charles, he, erm,
he gave me a sum of money

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:10.360
to write a couple of stories about
him being missing, most likely dead.

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:14.279
It was enough to convince the people
who wanted to do him harm.

1:02:14.280 --> 1:02:16.279
Who wanted to harm him?

1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.160
Alvin Smallbone.

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.799
They were involved in some racket
with cigarettes that went bad.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:26.639
Spring's definitely alive, then?
Yeah. Yes.

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:29.080
Living in Amsterdam.
Never looked back.

1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:39.119
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of breaching the Data Protection Act

1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:42.719
and the illegal interception
of communications.

1:02:42.720 --> 1:02:45.520
Ah! I thought we were doing a deal!

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.879
I don't do deals.

1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:51.399
Christ, this has got to be
a wind-up. Come on, mate!

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:52.640
What the...?

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:56.919
What... What do you mean that
there's nothing that you can do?

1:02:56.920 --> 1:02:59.319
I'm sorry this is not
what you wanted to hear.

1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:01.360
He is my son!

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:04.919
I'm going to ask you to leave,
Mr Whiteley.

1:03:04.920 --> 1:03:07.799
Why won't you help me?
Why won't any of you just help me?

1:03:07.800 --> 1:03:09.680
You're scaring me, Mr Whiteley.

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:14.000
What, this? This is nothing!
CRASHING

1:03:25.680 --> 1:03:27.280
That's great, thanks.
No problem.

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:36.119
Roy? Just been talking to Liz,
the PCSO,

1:03:36.120 --> 1:03:39.639
she attended a disturbance at
a solicitors' office this morning.

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:42.679
A man was behaving in
a threatening manner towards staff

1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:45.760
because he claimed he was being
denied access to his son.

1:03:46.720 --> 1:03:48.799
Sorry, what's this got to do
with the inquiry?

1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:52.159
His son with Gaia.
Roan's father?

1:03:52.160 --> 1:03:54.600
Yeah... Eric Whiteley.

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:58.639
The accountant for the pig farm.

1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:02.439
Well, maybe Eric Whiteley
is the thread that links everything.

1:04:02.440 --> 1:04:04.800
Maybe he's been impersonating Myles.

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:09.320
Find Whiteley,
bring him in for a chat. Yeah.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.039
# Don't know how you got in my head

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:20.479
# They always said that you were
Poison

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:23.759
# Poison lover
How'd you end up here in my bed... #

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.839
TURNS MUSIC OFF

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:28.439
You guys look so serious. Is it bad?

1:04:28.440 --> 1:04:31.039
We need to talk to you
about your son, Roan.

1:04:31.040 --> 1:04:33.200
Guys, can you give me a minute?

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:38.359
Is Roan OK? Is he hurt?

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:40.720
He's at school, he's fine.

1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:44.839
Is Eric Whiteley Roan's father?

1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:47.559
Who?
Eric Whiteley.

1:04:47.560 --> 1:04:50.319
He says he's Roan's dad
and that you're denying him access.

1:04:50.320 --> 1:04:53.319
Ah, I... I don't know who that is.

1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:55.000
Then, who is Roan's father?

1:04:56.360 --> 1:04:58.199
Is that important?

1:04:58.200 --> 1:05:01.240
Actually,
I think it could be crucial, yeah.

1:05:02.520 --> 1:05:04.479
OK.

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:05.800
OK.

1:05:10.560 --> 1:05:11.799
SHE EXHALES SHARPLY

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:13.880
Sorry, I don't usually
talk about this.

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:21.319
When I was really young,
I tried to play in the pubs,

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:24.799
there was this one landlord who went
out of his way to be supportive.

1:05:24.800 --> 1:05:27.359
He let me play on a Friday night.

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:31.079
I was thrilled, even though
it was out in Tillingley,

1:05:31.080 --> 1:05:32.960
and the audiences were tiny.

1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:37.320
And then I would play
every Friday night.

1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:44.720
I thought he was my... friend...

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:50.959
..but then one night, after my set,

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:52.840
he said that I owed him...

1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:56.840
..for all of his help.

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:01.800
Roan's dad was a rapist.

1:06:06.920 --> 1:06:08.719
Did you report the rape
to the police?

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:11.879
I was going to, but...
SHE BREATHES DEEPLY

1:06:11.880 --> 1:06:15.479
I heard that he'd killed himself,
so what would have been the point?

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:19.240
Gaia, this... pub landlord...

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:22.800
..was it Charles Spring?

1:06:24.800 --> 1:06:26.199
Yes.

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:28.679
But... But Roan doesn't know,
please don't tell him.

1:06:28.680 --> 1:06:30.800
BUZZING
We won't, I promise.

1:06:31.880 --> 1:06:33.120
Excuse me.

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:35.800
Grace.

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:40.719
OK, thanks.

1:06:40.720 --> 1:06:44.839
Bella says Eric didn't show up
for work this morning.

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:48.159
Gaia, we need to get you and Roan
away from this area

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:50.880
while we track down Eric Whiteley.

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.160
SHE EXHALES

1:06:58.680 --> 1:07:01.399
Larry, can we go to LA tonight?

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:04.279
Yes! Love the idea! I'll set it up.

1:07:04.280 --> 1:07:07.879
Hey. Hey, are you OK?
I'll be fine.

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.239
Would you mind taking me
to pick up Roan from school?

1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:11.679
Yeah, sure. No problem.

1:07:11.680 --> 1:07:13.960
I'll sort things at your house
and pack the bags, yeah?

1:07:17.640 --> 1:07:20.679
Nick, what have we got
on Eric Whiteley?

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:24.160
Er, let me see. Eric...

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:27.999
Yeah, that's him.
Eric Whiteley -

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:32.319
he was arrested in 2017
for snatching a child

1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:34.759
outside Marine Way car park.

1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:37.279
He said the boy was his son,
but he wasn't.

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:39.079
OK, what was he charged with?

1:07:39.080 --> 1:07:42.359
Er, charges were dropped.
He was sectioned.

1:07:42.360 --> 1:07:44.479
What else have we got?

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:48.680
Right. In 2016,
he was interviewed after a drowning.

1:07:49.800 --> 1:07:51.960
William James Michael...

1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:54.599
..that's his son.

1:07:54.600 --> 1:07:57.439
He drowned?
Yeah.

1:07:57.440 --> 1:07:59.159
Coroner ruled
it was an accidental death.

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:02.360
It looks like he hasn't been able
to accept that his son's dead.

1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:06.199
He's still looking for him.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:09.439
And you're sure there's no discount
for anyone under the age of seven?

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:11.879
I mean, look, he's tiny.
MAN: 'No, I'm afraid not, sir.'

1:08:11.880 --> 1:08:14.919
All right, all right, well, how
about Gaia posts about the flight,

1:08:14.920 --> 1:08:17.799
gives you a bit of publicity,
can we get a free flight for her?

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.279
'I'm sorry.
It doesn't work like that, sir.'

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:22.640
You know, you will regret
this conversation.

1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:32.039
Yo, that's Gaia's.

1:08:32.040 --> 1:08:33.880
I'm entitled to 30% of it.

1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:37.360
He's been spiralling.

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:40.280
We all noticed.

1:08:50.600 --> 1:08:53.960
He made a boat like this
for William.

1:08:55.320 --> 1:08:57.919
I think he only turned away
for a moment,

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:02.079
and William had fallen in the water,
trying to reach the boat.

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:04.400
He could never accept he was dead.

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:08.879
Does he ever take these boats
to the pond where William drowned?

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:11.680
Yes. He spends hours there.

1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:14.240
Thank you.

1:09:33.520 --> 1:09:35.320
Eric, we need to talk.

1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:38.320
Sorry about Gaia.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:42.159
I shouldn't get so upset.

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:43.999
The grief's so overwhelming

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.800
that so... Sometimes,
I don't know what I'm doing.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:51.720
Why did you do it?

1:09:53.240 --> 1:09:55.360
It was a mistake.

1:09:58.280 --> 1:10:00.320
We know that Roan isn't your son.

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.160
I know that, too.

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:11.760
But if I just pretend he is,
it just makes the pain go away.

1:10:13.880 --> 1:10:17.559
I get to live in a world
where William is alive,

1:10:17.560 --> 1:10:19.800
even if it's just
for a little while.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.119
Even if there are consequences.

1:10:24.120 --> 1:10:28.360
When you shot Amber Tanaka,
thinking she was Gaia...

1:10:29.400 --> 1:10:32.199
..was the plan
to get custody of Roan?

1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:34.479
I haven't shot anyone.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:37.719
Sometimes, I follow Gaia
and her little boy,

1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:39.599
and, yeah, I pretend that he's mine.

1:10:39.600 --> 1:10:41.840
But, no, they didn't know,
I'd never hurt them.

1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:46.959
I shouldn't have shouted
at that solicitor, that was wrong.

1:10:46.960 --> 1:10:49.399
I should have just kept it
in my head.

1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:53.480
It's... It's just a daydream.
It's not real life.

1:10:54.800 --> 1:10:57.600
No-one can give William back to me.

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:02.560
Sorry for your loss.

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:17.960
Ooh!

1:11:20.520 --> 1:11:23.520
HE GROANS

1:11:26.560 --> 1:11:28.040
Hi, yeah, I need an ambulance.

1:11:29.640 --> 1:11:32.120
DOCTORS CHATTER

1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:39.160
You'll have to wait there.

1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.679
Roy, I'm at Sussex Central Hospital.

1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:53.599
Larry Brooker's been admitted
with a suspected poisoning.

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:55.039
Tunde told the paramedics

1:11:55.040 --> 1:11:57.399
that Brooker ate some food
at Gaia's house

1:11:57.400 --> 1:11:58.919
and fell ill shortly afterwards.

1:11:58.920 --> 1:12:01.000
ROY: 'Do we know
where the poison came from?'

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:05.080
OK. Thanks, Bella.

1:12:07.520 --> 1:12:09.359
Larry Brooker's been poisoned.

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:11.679
Really? What's his condition?

1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:15.639
Not good. Tachycardia,
hallucinations, blurred vision.

1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:18.839
The hospital hasn't been able
to identify the poison.

1:12:18.840 --> 1:12:20.799
Well, where did the poison
come from?

1:12:20.800 --> 1:12:22.520
Anna.

1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:49.479
OK, we're not looking
for the obvious.

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:52.560
Not rat poison or bleach, then.
No, exactly.

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:23.799
When me and Sandy
were trying for a baby,

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:26.479
she dug up all the dangerous plants
in the garden,

1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:27.679
and these were the worst.

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:30.040
They cause hallucinations
and heart failure.

1:13:33.560 --> 1:13:35.640
Poison Lover.

1:13:42.560 --> 1:13:44.400
It's foxgloves!

1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:49.599
He's eaten foxgloves.
Right, OK.

1:13:49.600 --> 1:13:51.920
OK. Yeah, thank you.

1:13:54.400 --> 1:13:56.840
Roan's still at school,
he's not been picked up.

1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:00.240
Anna and Gaia
should have collected him by now.

1:14:01.640 --> 1:14:03.720
Where's she taken her?

1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:38.360
Glenn!

1:14:43.040 --> 1:14:45.479
This is the coat
the suspect was wearing

1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.399
the night we thought
we were chasing Myles Royce.

1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:50.879
Anna was impersonating Myles Royce.

1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:54.519
Impersonating him,
keeping him alive on social media,

1:14:54.520 --> 1:14:58.319
basically covering up for the fact
that she'd murdered him.

1:14:58.320 --> 1:15:01.239
All units
looking for Anna Galicia's car,

1:15:01.240 --> 1:15:03.079
see if she has a GPS tracker,

1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:05.720
and see if we can locate her phone.

1:15:11.680 --> 1:15:13.920
Anna and her family. Recognise them?

1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:17.319
Charles Spring and his wife Nicola.

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.279
This is the fishing lake
where we recovered the severed arm.

1:15:21.280 --> 1:15:23.719
It's just down the road
from the pig farm,

1:15:23.720 --> 1:15:25.360
about a mile away from the pub.

1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:29.480
She must have grown up there
before Charles disappeared.

1:15:30.760 --> 1:15:33.039
So she knew about
the fishing lake...

1:15:33.040 --> 1:15:34.240
and the pig farm.

1:15:35.560 --> 1:15:37.400
That's where the connection is.

1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:40.680
Mrs Spring?

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:44.479
DS Norman Potting.
DS Bella Moy.

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:47.839
Are you OK to talk?
We need help to find your daughter.

1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:50.640
She's taken Gaia Lafayette.

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:56.279
Gaia came into my pub,

1:15:56.280 --> 1:16:02.439
she seduced my husband,
and she ruined our family.

1:16:02.440 --> 1:16:05.880
After Charlie died,
I started drinking.

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:10.920
Do you know what his death
did to my little girl?

1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:17.119
And Myles has the nerve
to tell Anna...

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.880
that her lovely daddy is a rapist?

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:23.519
She gets angry.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:27.520
She just wants justice for her dad.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:38.039
Why are we stopping here?

1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:39.919
It's where I used to live.

1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:42.040
Come and see.
No.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:57.200
I was afraid you'd be difficult.

1:17:05.800 --> 1:17:08.520
Anna. Anna! What are you doing?

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:22.560
You're gonna take your own life.

1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:26.879
BREATHILY: Oh, my God.

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:29.639
Why? Why are you doing this?

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.800
Anna! Anna, stop!

1:17:37.840 --> 1:17:39.839
I've prepared a very sad goodbye
from you,

1:17:39.840 --> 1:17:42.399
explaining that your lies
have destroyed your mental health,

1:17:42.400 --> 1:17:43.600
and you can't go on.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.799
It'll post when you're dead.

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:50.679
WOMAN: 'All units attending
the public house,

1:17:50.680 --> 1:17:54.200
'approach with caution
and liaise with CID on arrival.'

1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:48.720
Anna.

1:18:53.920 --> 1:18:56.439
I'll burn her
if you come any closer.

1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:58.159
Don't!

1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:00.199
Please, listen to me.

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:04.039
I know your father
is Charles Spring.

1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.840
Then you'll know that she is
the reason why he killed himself.

1:19:08.200 --> 1:19:10.839
She used him
to get everything she wanted!

1:19:10.840 --> 1:19:14.039
Their affair destroyed my family.
She got me put into care.

1:19:14.040 --> 1:19:16.400
I remember you now.

1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:19.319
You'd sneak down at night,

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:22.159
peek through the door to the bar
when I was playing.

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.679
Your dad would shoo you
back upstairs.

1:19:24.680 --> 1:19:26.719
Yeah, so you could be alone
with him.

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.639
He raped me, Anna.

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:31.999
Everything...
Everything you say is a lie!

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.680
Your dad's alive.

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:40.039
No.

1:19:40.040 --> 1:19:43.559
He faked his own death,
but not because of Gaia,

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:47.119
because he... He got into trouble
with some very bad people.

1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:51.359
He lied to you and your mother.
He abandoned you.

1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:52.919
That can't be true!

1:19:52.920 --> 1:19:54.159
He's alive.

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:57.119
He's alive and well
and living in Amsterdam.

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:00.159
And he could...
He could have got in touch with you,

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:03.960
at any point, to tell you
that he was OK, but he didn't.

1:20:11.840 --> 1:20:14.279
SHE MUMBLES

1:20:14.280 --> 1:20:17.239
He's the one
you should be angry with. Not Gaia.

1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:20.279
She was his victim.

1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:22.160
Come on.

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:33.159
But I...

1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:35.440
But I did all of this for him.

1:20:44.240 --> 1:20:46.440
You don't need to do this.

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:53.640
No!

1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:11.720
SHE COUGHS

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:23.080
Roy!

1:21:26.960 --> 1:21:29.040
Roy, where are you?!

1:21:30.080 --> 1:21:32.800
CRASHING

1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:47.640
COUGHING

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:51.720
Let's not do that again.

1:22:01.440 --> 1:22:05.119
# Sweeter than you and I

1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:07.720
# Together, we'll be

1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:15.759
# Holding hands
Beyond the sands of time

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:17.879
# Oh-oh, oh-oh

1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:21.639
# You're sweeter
Than a thousand peaches

1:22:21.640 --> 1:22:24.520
# To me

1:22:26.440 --> 1:22:31.359
# You need to know
You're always on my mind... #

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:35.279
I trust you're happy
with today's headlines, sir?

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:37.719
How you let a reporter
get close access

1:22:37.720 --> 1:22:40.479
to confidential information
is beyond me.

1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:43.560
I didn't ask Spinella to bug my car.

1:22:45.120 --> 1:22:48.079
What about Alvin Smallbone?
Not much progress there.

1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:50.399
Well, we've got the whole force
out looking for him.

1:22:50.400 --> 1:22:51.840
His luck will run out eventually.

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:54.920
Well, I guess you have it
all in hand.

1:22:56.280 --> 1:23:00.839
Oh, erm, I couldn't have done it
without DS Branson's help, sir.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:03.560
He... He performed his duties
admirably.

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:11.679
You took to being SIO quite easily.

1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:15.359
Yes, well, I, er...
I enjoyed the challenge, sir.

1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:17.639
Good result, too.

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:19.200
Yeah. Yes, sir.

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:22.839
It gives me great pleasure

1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:25.720
to tell you that you have passed
the promotion boards.

1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:31.800
Congratulations,
Detective Inspector.

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:36.360
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:43.679
CHEERING

1:23:43.680 --> 1:23:45.120
Congratulations.

1:23:46.400 --> 1:23:51.599
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Honestly, this, er, means a lot.

1:23:51.600 --> 1:23:56.879
Listen, Cleo has booked dinner
this evening, and you should come.

1:23:56.880 --> 1:23:59.479
We'll pull up a chair,
we'll order some champagne...

1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:01.839
I can't.
I can't because I have promised Ari

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:04.199
that we are gonna go out
on a date night.

1:24:04.200 --> 1:24:07.079
That is very good news!
Oh, yeah, I've just remembered,

1:24:07.080 --> 1:24:09.039
you've got a viewing
later on this afternoon.

1:24:09.040 --> 1:24:10.999
Oh, OK, good.

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:14.439
Yeah, well, it would be good if I
hadn't left a little bit of a mess.

1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:15.599
Oh, Glenn!

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:18.799
I know, I know, I thought I'd have
time to clear it up. Sorry.

1:24:18.800 --> 1:24:21.520
It's all right. I'll sort it.

1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:54.920
Marlon?

1:25:53.760 --> 1:25:55.640
DOOR CLOSES

1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:10.680
Hiya, erm, I'm looking...
Sorry, she's there, thanks.

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.120
Hey.

1:27:16.400 --> 1:27:17.519
HE SIGHS

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:18.920
You OK?

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:21.560
Yeah.

1:27:23.960 --> 1:27:25.799
Is this...

1:27:25.800 --> 1:27:28.000
A bad time for some news?

1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:31.319
Erm...

1:27:31.320 --> 1:27:34.360
Well, I could certainly do
with some good news.

1:27:55.960 --> 1:27:57.480
Are you sure?

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:04.400
What do you think about that?

1:28:06.040 --> 1:28:07.560
I think...

1:28:10.280 --> 1:28:11.440
..we're gonna be a family.

1:28:16.080 --> 1:28:20.119
You're gonna have to move
your record collection

1:28:20.120 --> 1:28:21.600
out of the study.

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:26.840
This is...

1:28:30.880 --> 1:28:32.680
I am so...

1:28:35.120 --> 1:28:37.320
I love you so much.

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:45.040
I love you, too.

1:28:47.520 --> 1:28:49.560
