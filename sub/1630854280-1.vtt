...AND NOW

02:26.000 --> 02:29.833
<i>The Disaster Prevention Agency reports
that unknown object is still moving.</i>

02:29.958 --> 02:34.083
<i>Behavioral principle unknown. Analyzing
with Kaiju Behavior Simulation D1.</i>

02:34.208 --> 02:35.833
<i>Evacuation route is undeveloped.</i>

02:35.958 --> 02:42.125
<i>Evacuation Simulation D2 is being
executed with civilians prioritized.</i>

02:42.250 --> 02:44.250
<i>SSSP has arrived at forward HQ!</i>

02:45.458 --> 02:50.000
<i>The DPA Minister has designated
the target as S-Class Species No. 7.</i>

02:50.458 --> 02:54.333
<i>Notice from the DPA.
D1 still under consideration.</i>

02:54.458 --> 02:56.875
Hello again.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.875
I'm the SSSP Captain, Tamura.

03:03.000 --> 03:07.333
We are assuming command as of this moment.
Your cooperation is appreciated.

03:07.458 --> 03:09.333
Yes sir. Let's skip the formal handover.

03:22.083 --> 03:25.958
The target is invisible, but can be
detected through surrounding debris.

03:26.083 --> 03:29.375
And it shows up clearly on infrared.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.500
Then isn't invisibility pointless?

03:31.625 --> 03:35.291
Lasers go through it.
Light transmittance is almost 100%.

03:35.416 --> 03:39.291
It can make its cells
have 0% reflection and absorption.

03:39.416 --> 03:40.833
Heat and light weapons won't work.

03:40.958 --> 03:44.458
If it's a bioweapon, it's for use against
a more advanced civilization.

03:44.583 --> 03:47.125
Target stopped near Yoshiwa substation!

03:47.875 --> 03:49.291
Why an electric substation?

03:58.041 --> 04:01.000
Wait... is it eating electricity?!

04:15.916 --> 04:18.166
<i>Change in Kaiju No. 7's visibility!</i>

04:18.291 --> 04:21.208
It seems to show itself when it's full.

04:21.333 --> 04:22.833
The invisibility's even more pointless!

04:22.958 --> 04:27.500
After charging, it reveals itself
to intimidate. It makes sense.

04:27.916 --> 04:31.000
If it eats electricity,
we should shut off its supply.

04:31.125 --> 04:34.208
Contact the Ministry of Economy
and the power company! Get it shut off!

05:07.666 --> 05:10.208
When the power stops,
it attacks the power grid.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.041
What a nuisance.

05:12.166 --> 05:16.166
Notice from the DPA.
S-Class Species No. 7 has been named.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.333
Target is hereby known as
Invisible Kaiju Neronga.

05:20.041 --> 05:21.375
Any reason behind that?

05:21.791 --> 05:24.250
The DPA Minister names them on impulse.

05:24.708 --> 05:29.625
Fascinating. How does it sense
where there's electricity?

05:29.750 --> 05:34.583
Maybe it has a quantum device that detects
the coordination of electric fields?

05:46.166 --> 05:51.000
<i>Neronga is heading towards Mt. Uji.
Blackout areas expanding.</i>

05:54.041 --> 05:57.750
Begin a reconnaissance-in-force and attack
before it causes even more damage.

05:57.875 --> 06:00.750
At this speed,
GPS-guided missiles can't miss.

06:00.875 --> 06:05.000
No radiation detected throughout.
A saturation attack is possible.

06:05.125 --> 06:08.125
Targeting the electrical horns
on its head seems most effective.

06:08.708 --> 06:09.833
Roger that.

06:10.541 --> 06:14.708
Forget the armor units.
Focus fire on Neronga's head.

06:30.875 --> 06:34.375
Target has shot down all missiles!
No hits!

06:34.708 --> 06:35.916
Unbelievable!

06:43.583 --> 06:45.000
An anti-surface discharge?!

06:45.208 --> 06:46.833
I think we just made it mad.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.041
Behavior Simulation D1 results are in.

06:50.166 --> 06:53.750
Left alone, Neronga will likely consume
all of Japan's electricity

06:53.875 --> 06:56.291
and discharge it all over Japan.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.291
What a pain...

06:58.416 --> 07:00.875
The Ministry of Economy and
Prime Minister's Office won't like this.

07:03.541 --> 07:04.791
It's Chief Munakata.

07:06.250 --> 07:07.250
What's the situation?

07:07.375 --> 07:09.208
There's been a setback.

07:09.333 --> 07:15.041
I see. The Secretary-General's suggesting
nuclear attack to the DPA Minister.

07:15.166 --> 07:19.625
It's probably an excuse to lead us
to possessing nukes, but you never know.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.666
It may only be for counter-Kaiju use,

07:21.791 --> 07:25.291
but this is what happens when they ratify
an international nuclear licensing treaty.

07:25.416 --> 07:27.958
For some reason,
Kaiju only appear in Japan.

07:28.083 --> 07:31.375
The international community
wants Japan to foot the bill.

07:31.500 --> 07:34.041
Do you think our politicians
can fight that pressure?

07:34.166 --> 07:36.208
I understand our situation.

07:36.833 --> 07:39.500
We'll try to resolve this
before the P5 do anything.

07:41.666 --> 07:44.541
That's the situation.
We need a viable option.

07:44.666 --> 07:47.375
Any ideas besides an attack
by the ground forces or cutting power?

07:47.833 --> 07:51.833
Fire a highly conductive material
into Neronga to cause electric leakage.

07:51.958 --> 07:53.583
Or use water to short it out.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.625
That could work, but its hide
is highly insulated and tough.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.208
Even an SDF excavator won't pierce it.

07:59.333 --> 08:05.458
It won't just let us punch a hole in it
and no tranquilizer has worked on a Kaiju.

08:05.583 --> 08:06.875
How about a long-term strategy?

08:07.000 --> 08:10.291
We can keep cutting off power
and try to starve it to death.

08:10.416 --> 08:13.583
It could take forever, and this is the
Chief Cabinet Secretary's electoral zone.

08:13.708 --> 08:16.458
The Prime Minister's Office
won't accept any more damage.

08:16.583 --> 08:20.083
I guess so.
In that case, I'm out of options.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.875
Same here. I have no idea.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.916
Captain, a child's still in the village.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.708
I'll handle this right away.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.375
All right. I'm counting on you.

08:54.708 --> 08:59.000
Anything! No one has any
swift and sure-fire ideas?!

08:59.125 --> 09:02.958
Object incoming from outside
the atmosphere. Speed, 12,000 kmph.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.750
Unknown object is slowing!
Heading this way!

09:22.833 --> 09:24.625
What happened?! Status report!

09:24.750 --> 09:26.666
Incoming object has crashed nearby!

09:26.791 --> 09:28.000
No, it's a landing!

09:28.125 --> 09:29.833
The object is moving!

09:30.333 --> 09:31.500
A new flying Kaiju?!

09:31.833 --> 09:32.583
No...

09:32.708 --> 09:35.833
Its silhouette is humanoid!

09:44.583 --> 09:46.291
What is this thing?!

09:46.416 --> 09:48.750
A... silver giant?

10:08.000 --> 10:11.875
Whoa. That's 500,000 kilowatts of power!
It can stand that?!

10:54.958 --> 10:56.291
It turned invisible again!

10:56.416 --> 10:57.416
Does it sense danger?

10:57.541 --> 10:59.125
Is the giant going to do something?

11:02.041 --> 11:03.291
What is it doing?

11:03.583 --> 11:05.000
High energy readings inside the giant!

11:08.666 --> 11:10.291
I don't know what's going on!

11:27.958 --> 11:29.000
Status report!

11:29.125 --> 11:30.125
What happened?!

11:30.250 --> 11:31.041
I don't know!

11:31.166 --> 11:32.333
It's a light wave heat beam!

11:32.458 --> 11:35.333
High ion readings!
The air's turned into plasma!

11:35.875 --> 11:38.750
How many gigajoules of heat was that?!

11:49.250 --> 11:53.291
Whatever it is, that giant is incredible.

12:10.750 --> 12:13.125
-It flies?!
-What?! That's impossible!

12:17.750 --> 12:20.125
Contact the radar sites! Don't lose it!

12:26.000 --> 12:27.958
<i>Mt. Mineoka station. Target lost.</i>

12:28.125 --> 12:30.083
Mt. Otakine station lost it, too.

12:33.791 --> 12:35.708
It disappeared in mid-air?

12:36.750 --> 12:38.375
Where did it go?

12:48.791 --> 12:49.625
See the Kaiju?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.208
Yeah I did!

12:51.333 --> 12:53.250
Did you see it turn invisible?

12:53.375 --> 12:54.958
I hope one doesn't appear in Tokyo.

12:55.083 --> 12:57.666
Why not? Kaiju are so amazing!

12:57.791 --> 12:59.125
They're so cool!

12:59.250 --> 13:00.250
I'm worried.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.916
Kaiju are like earthquakes to us Japanese.
When they hit, they hit.

13:04.041 --> 13:06.041
The newspapers were all sold out.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.000
One shows up in the countryside
and the media goes crazy.

13:09.125 --> 13:11.458
There wasn't much damage yesterday.

13:11.583 --> 13:14.708
Yeah. Our efforts
are finally showing results.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.833
So the ground force's Steel Rain
finally worked on a Kaiju.

13:17.958 --> 13:21.041
I hear a giant from the sky took it out.

13:21.166 --> 13:22.083
Seriously?

13:22.208 --> 13:27.250
Thanks to the widespread evacuation,
no civilian witnesses have been reported.

13:34.041 --> 13:39.208
Transferring from the Public Security
Intelligence Agency to the SSSP.

13:39.333 --> 13:40.625
I'm Hiroko Asami.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.416
I'm the Captain, Tamura.

13:43.375 --> 13:46.833
Our team has been assigned
to deal with the mysterious giant.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.416
That'll be your job.

13:48.541 --> 13:50.833
I still can't believe it.

13:50.958 --> 13:54.375
Is this giant humanoid a new Kaiju?

13:54.500 --> 13:58.000
We don't know.
It's why we asked for an analyst like you.

13:58.125 --> 14:01.250
Understood. I'll do my best
to meet expectations.

14:01.375 --> 14:04.625
I sensed in the giant an intelligence
different from that of Kaiju.

14:05.583 --> 14:07.083
It's just a personal impression.

14:07.208 --> 14:11.041
Initial impressions are important.
I'll keep that in mind.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.125
Welcome to the government's
independent young bloods.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.375
I'm Funaberi. Yumi Funaberi.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.083
I'm from the MEXT.
My specialty is biology.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.458
And you're also married.

14:23.583 --> 14:26.125
Captain Kimio Tamura
is from the Ministry of Defense.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.541
He's from the Bureau of Defense Policy.

14:28.666 --> 14:33.333
Akihisa Taki. Here from Johoku University
where he works in unparticle physics.

14:33.458 --> 14:37.541
A typical geek
who brings his personal life to work.

14:37.666 --> 14:40.708
You really were in intelligence.
You already know all about us.

14:40.833 --> 14:44.666
And that's my new buddy, Shinji Kaminaga.

14:44.791 --> 14:49.166
From Public Security, the National Police
Agency Security Bureau. That's all I know.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.583
He strives for anonymity.

14:51.708 --> 14:56.000
He says little and works alone.
I don't know him well.

14:56.125 --> 15:01.041
In the last incident, he and a child were
in the vicinity of the giant's landing.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.416
He didn't have a scratch.
He's amazingly lucky.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.166
So he was the closest to the giant.

15:09.041 --> 15:11.041
I'm Asami. It's a pleasure.

15:12.458 --> 15:15.583
I'm Kaminaga. By "buddy,"
do you mean "partner"?

15:16.583 --> 15:17.750
I guess so.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.583
I've only worked in teams or alone.
This is my first duo.

15:22.958 --> 15:23.833
I see.

15:23.958 --> 15:28.166
I suppose we're paired up
because of our similar background.

15:28.958 --> 15:31.791
But being buddies is about trust.

15:32.291 --> 15:34.916
Hopefully you can earn my trust.

15:35.375 --> 15:38.375
Where's your report on the giant?
It's not in my file.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.875
There was nothing to report.
I was unconscious.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.875
Already you're a useless buddy.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.833
What do I call the people here?

15:48.750 --> 15:51.708
They're SSSP members, just like you.

15:51.833 --> 15:55.000
No, I mean in terms of
human conceptual thought.

15:56.541 --> 15:58.833
They're our teammates.

15:59.375 --> 16:01.125
Our friends.

16:12.750 --> 16:13.875
How's the rookie?

16:14.000 --> 16:18.083
Outstanding. She's quick to adapt
and has good judgement.

16:18.208 --> 16:19.541
She works fast, too.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.291
Fast indeed.

16:24.791 --> 16:25.541
IDENTITY UNKNOWN

16:25.666 --> 16:27.083
And concise.

16:28.166 --> 16:29.708
ULTRAMAN (TENTATIVE NAME)
INVESTIGATIVE REPORT

16:30.041 --> 16:31.500
"Ultra"?

16:31.625 --> 16:36.916
It's code for top secret matters.
It was used in her training.

16:37.041 --> 16:40.875
"Ultraman." I like it.

16:41.541 --> 16:44.000
Though he is causing headaches.

16:44.125 --> 16:46.916
Information from NORAD and Yokota Base
has reached the White House.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.083
The US is becoming more interested.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.583
When it was Kaiju, all they would do
was sell us weapons.

16:52.708 --> 16:55.333
When it's an extraterrestrial,
they get involved.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.458
And now others are getting involved.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.125
Being a dominant country must be fun.

17:00.250 --> 17:04.500
So why do I have to write up a report
just to hand over to the US?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.416
Because the Chief told you to.

17:06.541 --> 17:11.708
They should get the information themselves
and not rely on a vassal state like us.

17:11.833 --> 17:17.708
What information? He's 60 meters tall and,
based on ground impressions, 2,900 tons.

17:17.833 --> 17:21.041
We know nothing about his beam,
how he flies, or his purpose.

17:21.166 --> 17:24.750
We don't even know
if he's naked or clothed.

17:24.875 --> 17:27.208
There's really nothing to go on.

17:34.458 --> 17:36.791
You're not very considerate.

17:40.666 --> 17:46.250
You could at least ask if I want a coffee
or just give me one.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.958
We are self-sustained,
individual organisms.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.750
We act on our own for ourselves.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.500
Society is more than just individuals.

17:55.625 --> 17:59.083
Your coffee, your clothes...
They are all made by someone else.

17:59.208 --> 18:03.291
Humans are social animals.
We depend on each other to survive.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.416
I see.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.666
So, a herd.

18:09.833 --> 18:12.291
This guy is an imbecile.

18:18.791 --> 18:19.916
Look out!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.000
It's crumbling!

18:24.458 --> 18:26.250
Avalanche!

18:27.958 --> 18:31.125
Get away from the bridge!
Get away! Quickly!

18:32.791 --> 18:36.333
A Kaiju has appeared in
the Momoyama District of Kamikita City.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.041
A chopper will be here in ten minutes.
Everyone, move out!

18:39.166 --> 18:39.916
Yes sir!

18:41.625 --> 18:43.333
Okay. My first mission!

18:44.125 --> 18:48.500
Out in the mountains again? I hate bugs!

18:48.625 --> 18:51.625
Oh come on. Show some spirit!

18:56.666 --> 18:59.791
<i>Earthquake detection system
locating the target.</i>

19:02.875 --> 19:05.583
We'll classify it as
a Subterranean Kaiju.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.416
A Subterranean Kaiju...

19:08.833 --> 19:10.083
I have a bad feeling.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.416
Civilian evacuation of target area
will be complete in 20 minutes.

19:13.541 --> 19:16.916
Kaiju No. 8 is digging through
the mountain moving in a straight line.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.166
Maybe we could use the tunnel it digs
for an expressway tunnel.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.500
Not for a while we can't.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.375
We're getting radioactive readings
in its wake...

19:29.500 --> 19:35.041
Yes. There are many similarities to
the Radiation-Eating Kaiju Pagos.

19:35.166 --> 19:39.291
You're right. It's heading directly
towards a nuclear waste storage facility.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.166
CONTROLLED AREA (STORAGE FACILITY)
NO UNAUTHORIZED ENTRY

19:42.291 --> 19:43.333
It is!

19:43.458 --> 19:46.541
Make sure everyone gets
protective gear on just in case.

19:46.958 --> 19:49.208
Asami, focus on radiation surveillance.

19:49.333 --> 19:49.833
Roger.

20:00.708 --> 20:05.291
<i>New seismic readings detected.
Target moving from Delta 6 to Echo 5.</i>

20:06.750 --> 20:10.083
Bingo. A 99% chance
it's the same type of Kaiju as Pagos.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.041
This is really bad.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.458
I'll assume it's a Case B
and report it to the Chief.

20:16.041 --> 20:18.208
This is really bad.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.250
Yes. Not only does it have
radioactive materials inside it,

20:21.375 --> 20:24.416
but, like Pagos, it may fire
some kind of nasty beam.

20:24.541 --> 20:28.333
We definitely want to avoid
radioactive materials scattering again

20:28.458 --> 20:29.833
like with Pagos.

20:29.958 --> 20:34.250
I'm initiating Case B in accordance with
the S-Class Species Suppression Protocol.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.583
I'll handle the higher-ups.
You handle the situation there.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.791
Roger that.

20:38.333 --> 20:42.541
The Chief will have the DPA
declare a State of Emergency B.

20:42.666 --> 20:45.125
Order a mandatory wide-range evacuation.

20:45.250 --> 20:48.541
Roger that. I'll check the local
monitoring system as a fail-safe.

20:48.666 --> 20:50.500
And we now have a name for it.

20:51.125 --> 20:52.958
The Subterranean Kaiju Gabora.

20:53.416 --> 20:55.541
With Gabora underground,
now might be our chance.

20:55.666 --> 21:00.708
Right. If we kill it underground, there's
less chance of radioactive contamination.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.916
Yeah. An MOP2 can reach this depth.

21:04.041 --> 21:08.125
All right. We'll purchase Massive Ordnance
Penetrators from the US right away.

21:08.875 --> 21:10.041
Get me the Prime Minster.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.458
-Get a status report.
-Send target location!

21:32.583 --> 21:35.250
-Kaiju No. 8 causing road collapses.
<i>-Cannot see target!</i>

21:35.375 --> 21:37.500
The explosions are masking
its seismic waves!

21:44.541 --> 21:47.333
<i>Underground roar detected!
Target is alive!</i>

21:47.458 --> 21:49.291
We can't just sit and wait.

21:49.625 --> 21:52.708
Contact Yokota Base. Keep bombing
until the target is neutralized.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.125
The US Military is out of munitions.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.500
It'll take six months to get more.

22:28.625 --> 22:33.166
Oh, have the US military
bill the Ministry of Defense. Not us.

22:50.958 --> 22:52.583
Target is in the open!

22:52.708 --> 22:56.708
This is bad. Only one mountain separates
it from the storage facility.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.791
Now is our only chance
for a direct attack.

22:58.916 --> 22:59.833
You're right.

23:00.125 --> 23:03.875
Gabora likely contains less radioactive
material than the facility.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.541
Let's call for a saturation attack.

23:05.666 --> 23:08.083
Data team, be ready for the giant
just in case!

23:08.208 --> 23:10.041
Have the radar sites monitor the skies!

23:10.166 --> 23:10.666
Roger!

23:10.791 --> 23:13.250
I wonder if Ultraman will show up again.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.458
<i>Gabora is headed for the storage facility!</i>

23:24.625 --> 23:28.708
Let's move to the command vehicle!
Asami, stay here and watch for the giant!

23:28.833 --> 23:29.750
Roger!

23:31.000 --> 23:33.875
Let's show some spirit!!

23:34.875 --> 23:35.750
Huh?

23:37.041 --> 23:38.125
Where's Kaminaga?

23:46.083 --> 23:48.958
Huh?! Is that... Ultraman?!

23:49.083 --> 23:51.166
He appeared on the ground this time?!
Why?!

23:51.291 --> 23:55.291
And his silver pattern has turned red!
Why?!

24:00.916 --> 24:02.666
So that's Ultraman.

24:05.291 --> 24:06.750
Beautiful.

24:13.666 --> 24:16.291
Follow Ultraman! We're moving! Come on!

24:58.833 --> 25:03.333
If Ultraman uses his beam
to destroy Gabora, it'll be catastrophic!

25:03.458 --> 25:05.041
He fires an unknown particle.

25:05.166 --> 25:08.333
There's no telling how it'll react
with Gabora's nuclear atoms!

25:08.458 --> 25:09.708
Let's assume the worst.

25:09.833 --> 25:13.500
By the SSSP special provision, I'm raising
the State of Emergency to High A!

25:13.625 --> 25:15.708
-Contact each ministry! Hurry!
-Yes sir!

25:16.416 --> 25:18.541
There he is! It's Ultraman!

25:20.208 --> 25:21.375
Where's Gabora?

26:59.791 --> 27:01.625
I knew it, it has the same face as Pagos!

27:04.625 --> 27:07.541
Then it can fire a very nasty beam, too?!

27:07.666 --> 27:08.208
What?!

27:29.291 --> 27:30.375
Why isn't he dodging?!

27:35.541 --> 27:38.500
It's weird. Despite the amount of
nasty beam it's shooting,

27:39.250 --> 27:41.041
the dosimeters aren't rising!

27:41.166 --> 27:45.333
Is he absorbing all the radiation
and neutralizing it?!

27:47.500 --> 27:50.500
Yes, he is. He's protecting us.

28:05.083 --> 28:07.583
His red patterns are turning green!

28:07.708 --> 28:10.000
Is it a sign of something affecting him?

28:10.125 --> 28:14.000
It seems so. It might be due
to a rapid loss of energy.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.541
He's taking Gabora away from us?

29:11.166 --> 29:14.708
Was he trying to avoid
any more harm to us?

29:14.833 --> 29:19.416
Maybe because the cleanup would
be difficult, like it was with Pagos?

29:19.541 --> 29:21.458
Yes. That's quite possible.

29:22.041 --> 29:24.375
He never used his beam.

29:24.708 --> 29:29.666
I don't know how, but he knew Gabora's
qualities and understood our situation.

29:29.791 --> 29:33.875
And right before he left...
He was making eye contact.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.791
<i>Target and Gabora both lost.
They disappeared again.</i>

29:38.625 --> 29:39.500
Let's get back.

29:39.625 --> 29:40.333
Yes sir.

29:40.458 --> 29:44.458
Anyway, we may be able to communicate
with Ultraman.

29:46.000 --> 29:47.291
There is hope.

29:50.833 --> 29:52.083
Welcome back!

30:14.000 --> 30:15.750
Pagos, Neronga, Gabora...

30:15.833 --> 30:20.375
Every part of their bodies was
about the same except the head and back.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.291
Like those parts were interchangeable.

30:22.416 --> 30:25.541
Until now, Kaiju were all
completely different.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.333
I finished my reports.
Now there's nothing to do.

30:32.583 --> 30:35.750
We're on standby for
Ultraman's next appearance,

30:35.875 --> 30:37.416
so all we can do is wait.

30:37.541 --> 30:40.250
He's only shown up to eliminate Kaiju.

30:40.375 --> 30:42.333
Where does he normally hide?

30:42.458 --> 30:45.583
The only place to regularly hide
something of that size

30:45.708 --> 30:47.375
would be in the ocean.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.750
How does he breathe and eat?

30:49.875 --> 30:52.000
Can he understand
human language and thought?

30:52.125 --> 30:54.500
The internet's overflowing with theories.

30:54.625 --> 30:58.541
Some civilians got the fight with Gabora
on video and uploaded it.

30:59.041 --> 31:01.458
Right now the world's abuzz about it.

31:01.583 --> 31:06.500
<i>...admitted its existence,
and has designated it as "Ultraman."</i>

31:08.833 --> 31:10.666
Kaminaga's not in again today.

31:11.750 --> 31:14.666
Yeah. He acts on his own too much.

31:14.791 --> 31:17.458
Where is he off wasting time?

31:19.916 --> 31:22.875
Maybe I'll check with my old agency.

31:26.583 --> 31:31.083
THE SAVAGE MIND

31:46.625 --> 31:47.958
Where's your partner?

31:48.416 --> 31:50.916
Off on his own again without permission.

31:51.333 --> 31:54.583
What does he think "buddy" means?

32:03.208 --> 32:08.000
The Chief's here from the fifth floor.
That's rare.

32:08.125 --> 32:10.375
Hopefully it's not a bad sign.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.166
Huh?! Wait!

32:21.583 --> 32:22.916
You're kidding.

32:25.625 --> 32:27.125
What's the cause?

32:27.250 --> 32:29.250
Unknown! Well, Taki?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.041
Taki!

32:34.708 --> 32:37.166
All of our data's toast.

32:37.291 --> 32:42.250
Who insisted on making these regulations?
A closed environment and no backups!

32:42.375 --> 32:44.416
I want to **** them!

32:46.625 --> 32:47.750
Me too.

32:48.250 --> 32:48.958
Who are you?!

32:51.208 --> 32:53.416
Forgive me. That was my fault.

32:53.875 --> 32:57.500
You know extraterrestrials exist.
There is no cause for alarm.

32:57.791 --> 32:59.291
My name is Zarab.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.791
Like Ultraman,
I am a visitor from another planet.

33:02.916 --> 33:05.125
You can consider me
Extraterrestrial No. 2.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.541
How did you get in here?

33:08.833 --> 33:10.208
That is a secret.

33:10.666 --> 33:14.916
I came here to communicate
with you directly.

33:15.041 --> 33:19.000
You say "communicate."
You understand our language?

33:19.458 --> 33:25.041
I have a translation app installed in
one of your devices. It should be working.

33:26.000 --> 33:29.166
<i>I'd like to test its capabilities.</i>

33:29.291 --> 33:31.791
<i>Can you speak this language?</i>

33:32.083 --> 33:34.291
<i>Of course. It is not a problem.</i>

33:35.625 --> 33:36.708
I guess it's working.

33:36.833 --> 33:41.416
When I materialized, I emitted
a powerful electromagnetic pulse.

33:41.541 --> 33:44.416
It seems that it caused
your current situation.

33:44.541 --> 33:49.750
It wasn't my intent. To make it up to you,
allow me to fix what I damaged.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.000
Whoa.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.958
How did you recover the lost data?

34:06.083 --> 34:08.333
I can do it by simply thinking.

34:08.458 --> 34:11.125
This ability is a function
of my natural physiological makeup.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.250
Unfortunately, it is not something
I can teach you to do.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.333
Let's get to the point.

34:17.083 --> 34:19.375
Why have you come here?

34:19.500 --> 34:21.750
To establish friendly relations
with this country.

34:21.875 --> 34:24.541
This planet is divided into groupings
called "countries."

34:24.666 --> 34:27.583
I wish to start a friendship
with this island nation.

34:27.708 --> 34:29.041
Why our country?

34:29.166 --> 34:32.333
It is where I landed. That is all.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.583
Not because Ultraman is here?

34:37.083 --> 34:39.958
Please let me speak
to the person you call Prime Minister.

34:42.333 --> 34:46.833
First a silver giant. Now a human-sized
extraterrestrial that can talk?

34:46.958 --> 34:49.791
The Prime Minister and extraterrestrial
are meeting in secret.

34:49.916 --> 34:53.000
I'm used to the unexpected.
Nothing surprises me anymore.

34:53.125 --> 34:57.083
But if other countries get wind of
an extraterrestrial who can communicate,

34:57.208 --> 34:58.541
it could complicate matters.

34:58.666 --> 35:01.708
They say he can control
electromagnetic pulses.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.083
According to reports, he can erase
and manipulate any electronic data.

35:05.208 --> 35:09.041
If Zarab gets angry, it won't just be
global economic chaos.

35:09.166 --> 35:10.625
It'll be worse than any Kaiju!

35:10.750 --> 35:12.708
Now that the world knows of Ultraman,

35:12.833 --> 35:15.416
global politics, economies,
militaries, and religions

35:15.500 --> 35:17.041
are being shaken to their cores.

35:17.166 --> 35:19.208
If he's friendly, then that's good.

35:19.458 --> 35:23.250
If we can form a treaty with him
before the rest of the world,

35:23.375 --> 35:25.583
we'd gain the upper hand
in all global politics.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.250
You were right.

35:33.916 --> 35:38.125
The details of the agreement are
not favorable but unequal and one-sided.

35:38.250 --> 35:41.916
This country will essentially
be subservient to Zarab.

35:42.041 --> 35:45.958
Huge quantities of intel
have been leaked to other countries.

35:46.083 --> 35:48.416
It's likely that Zarab leaked it.

35:48.541 --> 35:51.666
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is under
a lot of back-channeled pressure.

35:51.791 --> 35:55.458
And Zarab hinted at visiting other nations
in talks with the Prime Minister.

35:55.583 --> 35:58.291
He's better at politics
than human politicians.

35:58.416 --> 36:00.625
He's an extraterrestrial after all.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.541
He has overwhelming
technology on his side.

36:03.958 --> 36:10.041
Any help or technology Zarab offers
could lead to world dominance.

36:10.166 --> 36:13.500
So they want a quick treaty
to gain the global upper hand,

36:13.583 --> 36:16.041
regardless of how it's perceived
by other nations.

36:16.166 --> 36:21.125
The motives of those in power
never change.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.333
Curiosity killed the cat.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.958
It's your nature as an Intel officer,
but this time you have gone too far.

36:37.083 --> 36:38.833
There you are, Zarab.

36:39.875 --> 36:44.250
Why are you playing secret games
with world governments?

36:44.375 --> 36:47.750
To efficiently eliminate
the native intelligent life forms.

36:48.166 --> 36:53.583
I plan to cause conflict between countries
and have Homo Sapiens wipe themselves out.

36:54.541 --> 36:56.791
Humans have wisdom.

36:57.541 --> 36:59.208
It won't be so easy.

36:59.791 --> 37:04.333
It will be if I use
the existence of Ultraman.

37:05.333 --> 37:07.333
Why wipe out humans?

37:08.166 --> 37:09.708
I want to know why.

37:10.083 --> 37:15.666
Once a marker is discovered on a planet,
intelligent life forms must be destroyed.

37:15.791 --> 37:18.041
That is what I do.

37:18.166 --> 37:22.875
Homo Sapiens have destroyed
species that they considered harmful.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.500
From my perspective, it is no different.

37:25.625 --> 37:30.083
And while Homo Sapiens possess
sophisticated intellect and technology,

37:30.208 --> 37:34.458
they are a dangerous and unorganized
species that breeds unnecessarily.

37:34.583 --> 37:36.625
They are worth wiping out.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.166
We agree to disagree then.

37:40.500 --> 37:43.250
Sorry, but I can't let you do that.

37:43.625 --> 37:47.958
Do not bother.
You are already mine, Ultraman.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.500
Killing you is quite difficult.

37:50.625 --> 37:54.750
So, you must be detained
until I finish my work.

37:54.875 --> 37:57.916
Time to sleep, Ultraman.

38:14.250 --> 38:16.250
KAMINAGA

38:19.500 --> 38:20.625
Alone again?

38:21.000 --> 38:23.958
Yup. Not even a daily check-in.

38:24.291 --> 38:27.833
So I got an old friend in the PSIA
to track him for me.

38:27.958 --> 38:28.791
Any luck?

38:28.916 --> 38:29.791
Nope.

38:30.250 --> 38:32.916
Avoiding tails was part of his job,

38:33.000 --> 38:35.791
but he even managed to evade
my elite former colleagues.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.041
He's actually really good.

38:39.166 --> 38:41.416
I wonder what he's up to today?

38:44.166 --> 38:45.375
This is Tamura.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.416
What? Ultraman's appeared
at Yokosuka Base?

38:49.125 --> 38:50.333
He's destroying the base?!

38:59.000 --> 39:01.208
It really is Ultraman.

39:01.333 --> 39:02.958
Where's our deployment order?

39:03.083 --> 39:06.666
It hasn't been given. Or rather,
it seems someone above is halting it.

39:06.791 --> 39:12.333
Captain, a counter-extraterrestrial team
has been formed and has assumed command.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.208
That was too quick for
the Prime Minister's Office.

39:16.791 --> 39:18.750
Someone's pulling strings.

39:21.541 --> 39:22.708
Open fire!

39:22.833 --> 39:23.958
Open fire!

39:24.083 --> 39:25.583
Stop him here!

39:30.208 --> 39:34.333
We're engaging Ultraman.
Anti-ship missiles have no effect.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.416
Darn!
What's the point of being combat ready?

39:36.541 --> 39:37.625
Can't we do anything?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.208
Ultraman has vanished!

39:39.333 --> 39:40.208
Vanished?!

39:42.125 --> 39:43.250
Prime Minister.

39:44.916 --> 39:48.875
It seems what I warned of
has come to pass.

39:49.000 --> 39:55.250
TOKYO BAY LIVE CAMERA
YOKOSUKA 1

39:55.375 --> 39:56.708
That's strange.

39:57.166 --> 40:01.333
It's almost like he wants us
to see him causing damage.

40:01.625 --> 40:05.791
It doesn't matter,
Ultraman is now our enemy.

40:12.916 --> 40:15.416
What? You found Kaminaga's car?

40:15.541 --> 40:19.291
That's strange.
He's not one to leave a trace.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.125
Whoa!

40:20.625 --> 40:22.541
Look at this!

40:35.000 --> 40:36.458
Is this a fake?

40:36.583 --> 40:40.250
There's no evidence of tampering.
It's probably the original.

40:40.375 --> 40:42.041
I don't understand at all.

40:42.166 --> 40:44.666
Everything we've learned is for nothing!

40:44.791 --> 40:46.833
Find out who that man is!

40:46.958 --> 40:49.083
Analyzing the upload access log.

40:49.208 --> 40:51.375
Identifying the target.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.000
Sharing data now.

40:54.166 --> 40:56.916
That outfit looks kind of familiar.

40:57.041 --> 40:59.250
I've got the access log... Huh?

40:59.375 --> 41:00.458
My computer?

41:00.583 --> 41:02.833
Oh, there's other angles, too!

41:04.583 --> 41:05.833
Shinji Kaminaga?!

41:08.333 --> 41:09.458
Wait...

41:10.250 --> 41:11.666
He's Ultraman?!

41:13.416 --> 41:15.166
It's hard to believe.

41:16.458 --> 41:19.791
Facial recognition complete.
There's no mistake.

41:20.166 --> 41:23.750
It's SSSP Member,
Senior Superintendent Shinji Kaminaga.

41:24.750 --> 41:25.916
I see.

41:26.666 --> 41:28.833
My instincts are confused.

41:28.916 --> 41:31.041
But reason compels me
to accept that it's true.

41:31.166 --> 41:34.791
He was an extraterrestrial all this time?

41:37.250 --> 41:39.916
I can't believe you never shared this!

41:40.333 --> 41:42.083
Some buddy you are!

41:42.208 --> 41:44.708
Asami, are you still unable to
reach Kaminaga?

41:44.833 --> 41:50.125
It's not that I can't get through.
His whole phone number has been canceled.

41:50.250 --> 41:53.958
If he really is Ultraman,
then someone may have kidnapped him.

41:54.083 --> 41:57.500
Agreed. His car was abandoned
for three days.

41:57.625 --> 42:00.000
You don't think
a foreign intelligence agency...

42:00.125 --> 42:04.000
Not likely. He's not dumb enough
to get captured by another agent.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.333
Then who?

42:05.958 --> 42:08.833
None of the city's security cameras
have any trace of him.

42:08.958 --> 42:15.666
We can only assume every security video
has been altered with pinpoint accuracy.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.625
The only one who can do this is...

42:19.916 --> 42:21.375
ULTRAMAN ELIMINATION PLAN
PROPOSAL

42:21.500 --> 42:26.833
A being with this degree of destructive
power is trying to annihilate you.

42:26.958 --> 42:30.333
As someone who simply wants peace,
I cannot tolerate this extraterrestrial.

42:30.458 --> 42:33.625
I would like you to implement
this Ultraman Elimination Plan.

42:33.750 --> 42:37.833
I am willing to disclose
all information I have on him.

42:37.958 --> 42:40.708
Thank you.
We deeply appreciate your kind offer.

42:41.416 --> 42:43.041
We gladly accept.

42:43.166 --> 42:46.666
If you don't mind,
we have some questions for you.

42:46.791 --> 42:49.000
How does his light wave heat beam work?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.833
Spacium-133.

42:50.958 --> 42:52.583
Spacium-133?

42:52.708 --> 42:59.083
His body's made of a superheavy element,
atomic no.133, the source of his energy.

42:59.208 --> 43:00.708
He emits a form of that.

43:00.833 --> 43:01.875
How does he fly?

43:02.000 --> 43:05.208
By utilizing the energy of Spacium-133.

43:05.333 --> 43:08.083
He warps gravity and manipulates it.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.416
How did he come here?

43:09.541 --> 43:10.666
No comment.

43:10.791 --> 43:16.166
Our interstellar agreements forbid us from
revealing it to non-signatory life forms.

43:18.041 --> 43:22.750
What's the mechanism by which a human
enlarges and transforms into Ultraman?

43:22.875 --> 43:25.875
I do not know. You will have to ask him.

43:26.833 --> 43:28.041
But...

43:28.625 --> 43:31.750
is Ultraman really our enemy?

43:33.208 --> 43:36.458
Isn't eliminating him
being a little rash?

43:38.000 --> 43:42.000
I feel the giant in Yokosuka wasn't him.

43:42.666 --> 43:44.125
DPA Minister...

43:44.250 --> 43:50.416
If Ultraman reappears, you will realize
that he must be eliminated.

43:59.958 --> 44:01.583
So you are awake, Ultraman.

44:01.708 --> 44:03.750
Sorry to immobilize you in that way.

44:03.875 --> 44:09.166
You require the Beta System to summon
your Ultraman body from another dimension.

44:09.291 --> 44:13.250
I will now scan you again
for the ignition device.

44:17.708 --> 44:18.625
Nothing.

44:18.916 --> 44:21.916
You do not have the ignition device.

44:22.041 --> 44:23.583
Where did you hide it?

44:26.750 --> 44:27.666
Very well.

44:28.500 --> 44:32.375
You can no longer transform into Ultraman.
That is enough.

44:44.166 --> 44:44.833
KAMINAGA

44:45.166 --> 44:49.666
Only he could pull off a trick like this.

44:57.208 --> 44:58.958
BETA CAPSULE
I LEAVE IT WITH YOU

44:59.083 --> 45:01.250
Why did he give this to me?

45:24.208 --> 45:27.666
Is this the device he uses to transform?

45:34.083 --> 45:35.166
He appeared again?

45:35.291 --> 45:38.666
Zarab was right.
Ultraman really is our enemy.

45:38.791 --> 45:41.000
Yes. He was deceiving us all along.

45:41.125 --> 45:43.958
Absolutely.
The SSSP report is not credible at all.

45:45.791 --> 45:49.291
And I thought I was at least
a good judge of character.

45:49.916 --> 45:52.000
Order the SSSP to move out.

45:52.125 --> 45:55.541
Even if Ultraman's true identity
is Kaminaga...

45:56.208 --> 45:59.875
We must fight against anything
that threatens peace and order.

46:03.083 --> 46:03.833
Move out.

46:04.291 --> 46:05.125
Yes sir!

46:13.916 --> 46:14.458
Who are you?

46:14.583 --> 46:16.625
A former associate of
the man who is Ultraman.

46:16.750 --> 46:18.083
You know where he is?

46:18.208 --> 46:22.375
Yes. He asked me to contact you
if anything happened.

46:22.500 --> 46:23.291
Captain.

46:23.416 --> 46:24.375
It's all right.

46:24.500 --> 46:26.333
Permission granted. Let's go.

46:28.125 --> 46:29.625
Captain, where is Asami going?

46:29.750 --> 46:31.291
She has a separate mission.

46:33.166 --> 46:35.208
Asami is acting on her own.

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
Like a true partner of his.

46:38.125 --> 46:41.375
After I parted with Kaminaga,
Zarab appeared.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.333
He gave me a signal
telling me to track him.

46:44.500 --> 46:47.416
Zarab abducted him, turned invisible,
and vanished.

46:48.833 --> 46:51.833
But Kaminaga left a trail
with special ink.

46:53.291 --> 46:54.666
This is where he's being held.

46:55.666 --> 47:00.041
My team makes sure to use
only analog sources to prevent tampering.

47:00.166 --> 47:01.708
So I've given you a hard copy.

47:04.708 --> 47:09.250
Even when encrypted, phones and emails
are always monitored.

47:09.375 --> 47:13.375
I see. It also looks like Zarab
can't manipulate film negatives.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.250
The ink hasn't faded yet.
It should lead straight to him.

47:18.000 --> 47:20.666
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

47:33.000 --> 47:37.958
Zarab can turn invisible. Utilizing that
ability he can create optical illusions.

47:38.083 --> 47:39.333
Even a fake Ultraman.

47:39.458 --> 47:41.375
It would be easy for Zarab.

47:49.541 --> 47:50.375
This way.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.291
Electronics don't work here.

47:56.416 --> 47:58.125
It must be Zarab, I'm sure of it.

47:58.541 --> 48:00.958
I'm the SSSP captain, Tamura.

48:02.000 --> 48:03.375
I'm the platoon commander.

48:04.041 --> 48:06.708
We can't contact our bases
in Ichigaya or Kisarazu.

48:07.541 --> 48:09.291
We're on our own.

48:09.875 --> 48:13.625
I've been told to follow your orders
in such conditions.

48:15.458 --> 48:16.916
What should we do?

48:17.208 --> 48:21.000
This is a populated area.
We should avoid attacking him.

48:22.458 --> 48:26.000
If I may, sir...
I hear he's on your team.

48:26.791 --> 48:28.208
Are you letting him go?

48:28.791 --> 48:29.791
No.

48:30.583 --> 48:33.166
Anti-ship missiles
are ineffective against him.

48:33.791 --> 48:35.375
All we can do is wait.

48:36.083 --> 48:37.166
Wait?

48:37.583 --> 48:38.333
For what?

48:44.250 --> 48:46.541
I didn't expect this from you, Asami.

48:47.375 --> 48:48.750
I underestimated you.

48:55.541 --> 48:59.041
The whole world knows who you are now.

48:59.708 --> 49:00.750
I see.

49:04.875 --> 49:06.125
So...

49:07.375 --> 49:08.791
You admit it.

49:13.916 --> 49:16.666
You made fools of us! You lied to us!

49:16.791 --> 49:18.000
I never lied.

49:18.541 --> 49:19.916
I just never told you.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.416
Why didn't you tell us?!

49:22.208 --> 49:24.625
What would you have done?

49:33.000 --> 49:34.291
All right.

49:35.166 --> 49:36.375
I won't judge you.

49:38.875 --> 49:42.125
A man claiming to be
your former associate helped me.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.750
Were you always expecting me
to rescue you?

49:45.875 --> 49:48.458
Of course. You're my buddy.

50:00.833 --> 50:02.416
Just tell me one thing.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.958
Are you an extraterrestrial?

50:05.750 --> 50:07.083
Or a human?

50:07.416 --> 50:08.750
I'm both.

50:10.666 --> 50:13.416
Some things are only clear
when you are in between.

50:14.458 --> 50:16.375
I believe this is why I exist.

50:17.916 --> 50:19.083
I believe in you too.

50:20.125 --> 50:22.083
You trusted me with this.

50:22.916 --> 50:24.416
So I trust you.

50:28.083 --> 50:30.666
Your imposter is here
and destroying the city.

50:31.416 --> 50:32.541
Take him out!

50:43.375 --> 50:44.416
What's that?

50:44.791 --> 50:45.958
Is that a person?

50:48.958 --> 50:51.875
I see her! That's our analyst, Asami!

50:57.416 --> 50:59.666
We're counting on you, Kaminaga.

51:17.375 --> 51:19.083
There's another Ultraman?!

51:19.208 --> 51:20.958
This one is the real one.

52:06.500 --> 52:09.291
Wow! That's Spacium-133!

52:31.250 --> 52:33.833
I knew it was Zarab.

52:34.083 --> 52:35.458
We were right.

53:59.333 --> 54:00.583
Thank you...

54:01.083 --> 54:02.416
Kaminaga.

54:05.291 --> 54:07.500
Yes!
Former Senior Superintendent Kaminaga!

54:07.625 --> 54:09.916
Find him and secure him!
Priority One.

54:10.041 --> 54:13.791
Intelligence agencies across the world are
also looking. We have to find him first.

54:13.916 --> 54:18.166
All this and we still can't find him.
Where has Shinji Kaminaga gone?!

54:20.291 --> 54:23.583
Kaminaga is right to stay hidden.

54:23.708 --> 54:29.000
If a person could become Ultraman, anyone
would want to take advantage of him.

54:29.125 --> 54:30.541
What about his human rights?

54:30.666 --> 54:32.541
He's an extraterrestrial now.

54:32.666 --> 54:35.500
The government has already
pronounced him dead.

54:35.791 --> 54:37.708
Quick work for a government office.

54:37.833 --> 54:40.625
They just want to use him
as Ultraman no matter what.

54:40.750 --> 54:42.500
Japan's not the only country that does.

54:42.625 --> 54:44.916
Yeah, and with the Zarab incident,

54:45.000 --> 54:48.166
the Prime Minister's going around
apologizing to the UN and G9.

54:48.291 --> 54:50.208
The Prime Minister's under pressure.

54:50.750 --> 54:52.291
But so are we.

54:54.458 --> 54:58.916
I saw old colleagues and CIA
and SIS agents outside this morning.

55:02.500 --> 55:04.083
I made sure to say "Hi."

55:04.208 --> 55:08.208
Spying on us won't help.
What a waste of time.

55:08.333 --> 55:09.708
Is Asami not in today?

55:09.833 --> 55:12.000
Yes. She's AWOL again.

55:12.125 --> 55:14.416
I get it's hard to come in after that,

55:14.541 --> 55:17.583
but disappearing gives the media
the chance to say they've eloped.

55:17.708 --> 55:21.375
Her PSIA background
makes them easy gossip targets.

55:21.500 --> 55:23.875
Anyone would want to disappear for a bit.

55:24.000 --> 55:28.333
But I'm worried.
It's unlike her not to give any notice.

55:34.791 --> 55:35.791
What?

55:36.458 --> 55:37.750
Asami's been found?

55:41.791 --> 55:42.916
This way.

55:44.041 --> 55:47.250
Excuse me! Clear the way! Coming through!

55:47.375 --> 55:50.875
Excuse me! Excuse me! Clear the way!
Coming through! Excuse me!

55:51.000 --> 55:51.833
Let us through!

55:51.958 --> 55:52.708
Excuse me!

55:52.833 --> 55:53.458
Let us through!

55:53.583 --> 55:55.000
Excuse me! Excuse me!

56:07.500 --> 56:08.500
Whoa.

56:08.958 --> 56:10.958
It really is Asami.

56:13.916 --> 56:15.875
Anti-tank choppers are on their way.

56:16.000 --> 56:17.958
Tell the brass to hold their attack.

56:24.916 --> 56:26.500
Let's get closer.

56:36.833 --> 56:37.791
Asami!

56:38.791 --> 56:41.000
Are you Hiroko Asami?!

56:43.416 --> 56:45.708
What's wrong?! Can you hear me?!

56:45.833 --> 56:47.000
Answer me!

56:47.125 --> 56:50.208
Look at those blank eyes.
She seems hypnotized.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.625
We're under attack from the giant female!
Evacuate the area!

57:02.750 --> 57:04.083
Casualties expected!

57:19.416 --> 57:23.666
The Prime Minister has authorized
lethal force. Permission to fire?

57:23.791 --> 57:25.541
Hold your fire.

57:25.666 --> 57:28.875
She may be giant,
but she could still be human.

57:29.125 --> 57:30.125
<i>That's right.</i>

57:30.666 --> 57:33.708
<i>You'd be wise not to attack her.</i>

57:34.000 --> 57:36.208
<i>This is a demonstration.</i>

57:36.666 --> 57:42.583
<i>Just a presentation
to you native species of this planet.</i>

57:42.875 --> 57:45.250
Who are you?! Show yourself!

57:45.375 --> 57:47.000
<i>There's no need for that.</i>

57:47.583 --> 57:54.375
<i>I just want you to know that Ultraman
isn't the only one with this technology.</i>

57:54.500 --> 57:55.916
<i>Good day.</i>

58:03.583 --> 58:04.750
Asami!

58:04.875 --> 58:06.541
Is she dead?!

58:06.666 --> 58:08.958
No, she's alive! I can detect breathing!

58:13.416 --> 58:14.666
Thank goodness.

58:16.125 --> 58:19.333
That voice hinted at
offering advanced technology.

58:19.458 --> 58:22.500
They'll contact us. Let's wait for them.

58:24.250 --> 58:25.708
I'll join you there.

58:25.833 --> 58:27.416
Understood, sir.

58:29.916 --> 58:35.000
The ability to make humans gigantic could
lead to the militarization of Ultraman.

58:35.125 --> 58:38.708
It won't just be Japan.
The whole world will want this.

58:38.833 --> 58:41.666
This'll be another hassle.

58:41.791 --> 58:45.041
And Kaminaga's nowhere to be found.

59:11.750 --> 59:15.625
It's like Sleeping Beauty
mixed with Gulliver's Travels.

59:15.750 --> 59:17.875
Chief, those references are too old.

59:18.916 --> 59:20.000
Analysis complete.

59:20.125 --> 59:24.000
We did composite electromagnetic
scans of her body.

59:24.125 --> 59:28.333
There are heat energy variances, but
all other data is flat, even her clothes.

59:28.458 --> 59:31.916
It's like her entire body's composed
of an unknown homogenous material

59:32.041 --> 59:33.291
different from human somatic cells.

59:33.416 --> 59:35.375
Like Ultraman?

59:36.125 --> 59:37.208
What about bio samples?

59:37.333 --> 59:38.208
It's just that.

59:38.333 --> 59:42.166
Normal cutting devices, even lasers,
can't cut a single hair.

59:42.291 --> 59:46.041
We couldn't even cut off a single micron
of body tissue. Her clothes too.

59:46.166 --> 59:48.000
We couldn't get any samples.

59:48.125 --> 59:50.041
She's practically indestructible.

59:50.166 --> 59:53.000
Even empty-handed,
she could function as a weapon.

59:53.125 --> 59:55.916
We don't know anything about
her current state.

59:56.041 --> 59:59.625
All we know is that she's breathing
and she's still alive.

59:59.750 --> 1:00:04.833
Yeah. Just what is life?
This flips biological science on its head.

1:00:05.958 --> 1:00:08.625
All the knowledge humanity
has accumulated up to now

1:00:08.750 --> 1:00:12.375
amounts to nothing more than
common sense for extraterrestrials.

1:00:13.583 --> 1:00:14.833
Don't be so discouraged.

1:00:14.958 --> 1:00:16.875
That's what that voice wants.

1:00:17.500 --> 1:00:19.875
It left Asami behind
so we'd study her and realize

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:22.791
that we can't grasp
their secret of human enlargement,

1:00:22.916 --> 1:00:25.416
making its presentation
that much more valuable.

1:00:25.541 --> 1:00:28.083
Well done. You're correct.

1:00:29.333 --> 1:00:31.666
Sorry. The door was unlocked.

1:00:32.458 --> 1:00:34.208
No, I locked it.

1:00:36.458 --> 1:00:37.791
MEFILAS, EXTRATERRESTRIAL #0
AMBASSADOR EXTRAORDINARY

1:00:37.916 --> 1:00:40.291
That's very kind of you.

1:00:42.041 --> 1:00:45.750
"When in Rome do as the Romans do."
One of my favorite sayings.

1:00:45.875 --> 1:00:48.333
As those who've had
direct contact with Ultraman,

1:00:48.458 --> 1:00:50.458
I wanted to begin
negotiations through you.

1:00:50.583 --> 1:00:52.333
My name is Mefilas.

1:00:52.458 --> 1:00:56.250
I am Extraterrestrial No. 0.
I have come to bring this planet gospel.

1:00:56.375 --> 1:00:57.250
Number zero?

1:00:57.375 --> 1:00:58.250
Yes.

1:00:58.375 --> 1:01:02.916
I actually arrived here before Ultraman.

1:01:03.458 --> 1:01:07.333
I have been preparing my presentation
for some time now.

1:01:07.458 --> 1:01:09.458
So you're the voice from earlier?

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:11.250
Yes.

1:01:11.375 --> 1:01:13.791
But he looks human.

1:01:14.083 --> 1:01:17.208
We could not distinguish Ultraman
from ourselves either.

1:01:17.791 --> 1:01:21.583
First we'd like proof
you're an extraterrestrial.

1:01:21.916 --> 1:01:22.958
Then we'll talk.

1:01:34.250 --> 1:01:36.958
This alone should be enough proof.

1:01:37.458 --> 1:01:40.541
But everything starts with trust.

1:01:53.458 --> 1:01:55.083
Whoa...

1:01:56.333 --> 1:01:57.416
I don't believe it.

1:01:57.541 --> 1:01:59.250
This is a Beta Box.

1:02:00.041 --> 1:02:04.416
While not miniaturized like
Ultraman's Beta Capsule,

1:02:05.083 --> 1:02:07.041
it has the same fundamental structure.

1:02:33.291 --> 1:02:36.833
I'm not even drunk.
Why am I sleeping in plastic sheets?

1:02:37.916 --> 1:02:39.833
So now a third one.

1:02:40.166 --> 1:02:43.833
First Kaiju, and now even
extraterrestrials are normal in Japan.

1:02:43.958 --> 1:02:45.208
All rise!

1:02:48.166 --> 1:02:49.458
Sorry for the wait.

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:51.583
Not at all.

1:02:54.916 --> 1:02:57.000
Let's get down to business.

1:02:57.958 --> 1:03:01.000
"Strike while the iron is hot."
One of my favorite sayings.

1:03:05.583 --> 1:03:08.916
We seek the same thing, to create
a world brimming with peace and joy

1:03:09.041 --> 1:03:11.291
that permeates the multiverse.

1:03:11.416 --> 1:03:14.083
SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST EXTRATERRESTRIALS
THROUGH MAKING HUMANS GIANT

1:03:14.208 --> 1:03:16.375
I abhor violence.

1:03:16.708 --> 1:03:19.500
But when it comes to
violent beings like Zarab,

1:03:19.625 --> 1:03:23.208
sometimes power is necessary
for defense.

1:03:24.208 --> 1:03:28.250
As a deterrent, I will provide you with
a large quantity of Beta Boxes.

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:29.541
In return...

1:03:30.375 --> 1:03:33.541
I ask that you consider me
the Superior Conception.

1:03:34.291 --> 1:03:35.958
Your laws can remain the same.

1:03:36.416 --> 1:03:39.083
It won't have an effect on your lives.

1:03:39.958 --> 1:03:42.416
That's all that I ask.

1:03:45.041 --> 1:03:49.541
I understand.
We will consider your proposal favorably.

1:03:49.666 --> 1:03:55.041
There's no telling when
the next extraterrestrial will attack.

1:03:55.916 --> 1:03:57.708
"Better safe than sorry."

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:01.833
One of my favorite sayings.

1:04:08.166 --> 1:04:12.625
Did you hear? The Secretary-General's
lobbying for human-to-giant experiments.

1:04:12.750 --> 1:04:16.833
I heard. Weaponizing the Beta System
is more efficient than dealing with nukes.

1:04:16.958 --> 1:04:18.416
Soon the whole world will follow.

1:04:18.541 --> 1:04:20.291
Can't anyone consider a peaceful use?

1:04:22.291 --> 1:04:23.083
Oh.

1:04:23.541 --> 1:04:24.875
Welcome back.

1:04:25.583 --> 1:04:29.458
How'd you like being prodded and probed
by every government agency?

1:04:29.583 --> 1:04:33.291
They put me through the most
humiliating of tests, yet found nothing.

1:04:33.416 --> 1:04:36.166
All I got for it was days of indignity.

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:37.750
Then there's this.

1:04:41.083 --> 1:04:46.000
The whole world now knows my face,
I can never return to the PSIA!

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:47.291
You're a big star, Asami.

1:04:47.416 --> 1:04:51.083
You've taken over the top ten rankings
on social media across the world!

1:04:51.208 --> 1:04:52.625
Oh, no!

1:04:55.750 --> 1:04:59.791
Can't I just use public authority
to erase all of this!

1:05:00.541 --> 1:05:04.166
Mefilas...
I'll never forgive you for this!

1:05:05.416 --> 1:05:07.291
Message? From who?

1:05:07.416 --> 1:05:12.208
<i>My deepest apologies. I did not imagine
such crass individuals existed.</i>

1:05:12.333 --> 1:05:16.583
<i>I was foolish not to take
humans' base impulses into account.</i>

1:05:16.708 --> 1:05:21.666
<i>I know it's too late, but please allow me
to make amends for my mistake.</i>

1:05:21.791 --> 1:05:23.208
<i>I do hope you'll forgive me.</i>

1:05:23.416 --> 1:05:24.625
<i>Regards, Mefilas.</i>

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.083
Yes!

1:05:41.666 --> 1:05:44.291
Our time has come.

1:05:48.500 --> 1:05:50.708
"We are all in the same boat."

1:05:50.833 --> 1:05:52.625
One of my favorite sayings.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.291
Well?

1:05:54.791 --> 1:05:58.041
Will you work with me
on behalf of this planet?

1:05:58.958 --> 1:06:01.208
That depends on you, Mefilas.

1:06:01.916 --> 1:06:05.833
Well, in a way,
you're already working for me.

1:06:05.958 --> 1:06:07.166
So, it was you.

1:06:08.500 --> 1:06:12.375
You were the one
who woke the bioweapons of this planet.

1:06:15.500 --> 1:06:19.916
No, it was the humans' destruction
of the environment that awoke the Kaiju.

1:06:20.958 --> 1:06:22.625
The wrath of Mother Nature.

1:06:22.958 --> 1:06:24.958
It's like karma, Ultraman.

1:06:25.416 --> 1:06:29.000
Unlike the native species of this planet,
we are civilized.

1:06:29.458 --> 1:06:31.375
I'm in compliance
with our interstellar agreements.

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:36.583
Any interference with other planets
is limited to the use of living creatures.

1:06:36.708 --> 1:06:39.958
The initial creatures were just
for reconnaissance and tactical use.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:43.916
I then used the next-generation Invisible
Kaiju to attack the electrical industry.

1:06:44.041 --> 1:06:49.208
And the subterranean Kaiju was designed
to feed on nuclear waste.

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:53.958
They also served as
sufficient bait to lure you out.

1:06:56.625 --> 1:06:59.833
I wanted my plan to be
as cost-effective as possible.

1:06:59.958 --> 1:07:05.958
So, I've used what I could obtain
on this planet, including Zarab.

1:07:09.958 --> 1:07:12.250
By having them fight you...

1:07:13.291 --> 1:07:16.291
I made humans feel physically powerless.

1:07:16.416 --> 1:07:20.333
Revealing the Beta System
made them feel intellectually powerless.

1:07:20.458 --> 1:07:23.208
I wanted them to learn firsthand
their dependence on the mighty.

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:27.000
You have been instrumental in
instilling in humanity

1:07:27.125 --> 1:07:30.708
my idealistic notion of unconditional
obedience to extraterrestrial life.

1:07:30.833 --> 1:07:32.583
I am very grateful to you.

1:07:32.958 --> 1:07:36.166
You are the first successful
example of human fusion.

1:07:37.083 --> 1:07:39.166
It was also demonstrated in my experiment.

1:07:39.291 --> 1:07:42.458
Thanks to that, we now know that humanity
is an effective biological resource and

1:07:42.583 --> 1:07:45.583
can be converted into
a powerful and formidable weapon.

1:07:45.708 --> 1:07:51.416
I want to have absolute dominion over this
abundant and precious biological resource

1:07:52.916 --> 1:07:54.958
before it is ravaged
by other intelligent life.

1:07:55.083 --> 1:07:57.708
That's my only interest, Ultraman.

1:08:01.125 --> 1:08:02.208
Moreover...

1:08:02.333 --> 1:08:05.958
I think humanity should possess
the Beta System for self-defense

1:08:06.083 --> 1:08:11.166
in the event of invasion
from other extraterrestrials.

1:08:24.833 --> 1:08:25.750
I must thank Zarab.

1:08:25.875 --> 1:08:29.125
He made it hard for you to get around
in human society.

1:08:30.833 --> 1:08:33.083
But, this is unsettling.

1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.000
Let's get a drink.

1:08:43.416 --> 1:08:44.458
Kaminaga!

1:08:56.416 --> 1:09:00.000
I thought we were buddies.

1:09:00.375 --> 1:09:02.041
I should never have trusted him!

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.333
I'd rather not fight you.

1:09:06.666 --> 1:09:10.583
That's why I suggest you either
work with me or stand down.

1:09:14.166 --> 1:09:17.291
The life and death of humanity
is in my hands.

1:09:17.416 --> 1:09:21.291
I can use force at any time.
Obviously you can, too.

1:09:21.416 --> 1:09:23.541
But you choose not to.

1:09:24.041 --> 1:09:24.791
Why?

1:09:24.916 --> 1:09:31.541
As you said, for us to rule humans
would be to take all hope from them.

1:09:32.583 --> 1:09:35.791
It would stifle
their independent progress.

1:09:36.041 --> 1:09:36.916
I can't allow that.

1:09:37.041 --> 1:09:40.125
By the Code of the Planet of Light, yes?

1:09:40.958 --> 1:09:45.375
Then stay out of my affairs, Ultraman.

1:09:47.416 --> 1:09:50.750
I know this planet's value...
More than anyone in the multiverse.

1:09:50.875 --> 1:09:53.666
Surrendering this planet to me

1:09:54.416 --> 1:09:56.125
is the best option.

1:09:58.166 --> 1:09:59.916
Above all,

1:10:00.500 --> 1:10:02.833
I desire this beautiful planet for myself.

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:09.291
I, too, love the human race, Ultraman.

1:10:10.875 --> 1:10:13.708
You have already made
a secret agreement with this country.

1:10:19.791 --> 1:10:23.208
The natives sought the Beta System
of their own accord.

1:10:23.875 --> 1:10:29.291
Your Code keeps you from interfering with
native species. You can't stop this.

1:10:32.583 --> 1:10:34.666
My plan is perfect.

1:10:34.791 --> 1:10:36.958
How will you respond, Ultraman?

1:10:38.083 --> 1:10:40.291
By brute force if necessary.

1:10:40.958 --> 1:10:43.791
That's the will of the human inside me.

1:10:43.916 --> 1:10:46.083
The Code doesn't apply to him.

1:10:46.750 --> 1:10:48.000
I see.

1:10:48.125 --> 1:10:50.958
So that's why you fused with a native.

1:10:51.583 --> 1:10:53.291
A wise decision.

1:10:53.583 --> 1:10:54.541
That's not why.

1:10:55.083 --> 1:10:57.208
But I suppose that's the outcome.

1:10:57.333 --> 1:11:00.541
The Planet of Light
is aware of your actions.

1:11:01.125 --> 1:11:05.666
You're going to end up
dooming this planet.

1:11:05.791 --> 1:11:10.416
Even so, I want to protect these helpless,
vulnerable little life forms.

1:11:10.541 --> 1:11:11.708
Are you sure...

1:11:12.166 --> 1:11:17.416
that's your wish and not that
of the human inside you, Ultraman?

1:11:27.333 --> 1:11:29.041
How disappointing...

1:11:29.916 --> 1:11:32.000
A failure to reach an agreement.

1:11:33.333 --> 1:11:34.666
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

1:11:34.791 --> 1:11:36.625
-Check please.
-Right away.

1:11:41.208 --> 1:11:43.875
Do you mind if we split it, Ultraman?

1:11:44.666 --> 1:11:46.833
KAMINAGA

1:11:47.791 --> 1:11:49.791
What are you doing with that guy?!

1:11:49.916 --> 1:11:51.083
Where are you?!

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:52.333
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

1:11:52.541 --> 1:11:54.416
<i>It's better that you not know.</i>

1:11:54.541 --> 1:11:57.625
<i>I'll come to you.
You choose the location, buddy.</i>

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:00.625
All right.

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.500
I'll tell the team.

1:12:02.625 --> 1:12:06.000
Cell phones aren't secure,
so use S115 for contact.

1:12:06.125 --> 1:12:08.208
<i>Understood. Thank you.</i>

1:12:12.291 --> 1:12:17.083
I was really hoping to take a bath today.

1:12:20.958 --> 1:12:23.166
Take the Beta Box from Mefilas?

1:12:23.333 --> 1:12:27.708
You mean steal it. That means going
against the government. It's a crime.

1:12:27.833 --> 1:12:29.416
Even so, I need your help.

1:12:29.541 --> 1:12:32.125
Mefilas has already cut a deal.

1:12:32.250 --> 1:12:34.791
The handover is tomorrow.
We don't have time.

1:12:34.916 --> 1:12:38.416
We have to stop this
before the government gets the Beta Box.

1:12:38.541 --> 1:12:42.333
Abuse of the Beta System is too
dangerous for humans at the present time.

1:12:42.458 --> 1:12:45.041
So basically too much of a good thing.

1:12:45.166 --> 1:12:47.916
If humans can be used as bioweapons,

1:12:48.041 --> 1:12:51.583
there may come a day when
extraterrestrials go to war over us.

1:12:51.708 --> 1:12:52.541
Exactly.

1:12:54.375 --> 1:12:57.291
It's my fault for proving it's possible.

1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.208
And yet I got all of you involved.

1:13:04.208 --> 1:13:05.416
I'm sorry.

1:13:05.958 --> 1:13:07.125
All right.

1:13:08.208 --> 1:13:10.250
I'll handle the higher-ups.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:11.708
Thank you, Captain.

1:13:11.833 --> 1:13:13.458
But how do we get the Beta Box?

1:13:13.583 --> 1:13:17.666
It's hidden in the Planck brane dimension.
I need to locate its position.

1:13:17.791 --> 1:13:21.250
We can't perceive the Planck brane.

1:13:21.375 --> 1:13:22.375
So how...?

1:13:22.500 --> 1:13:26.250
If the system retains the first subject's
data, you could trace that.

1:13:27.291 --> 1:13:31.333
That's impossible. Quantified physical
data can't be detected from the outside.

1:13:31.458 --> 1:13:33.375
One piece of data can't be quantified.

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:35.125
The smell.

1:13:35.250 --> 1:13:36.125
The smell?

1:13:36.250 --> 1:13:37.041
Residual odor.

1:13:39.083 --> 1:13:40.833
There's no time. It'll have to do.

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:46.125
Huh?

1:13:47.208 --> 1:13:48.250
Now?

1:14:09.166 --> 1:14:12.250
Sorry. I've been too busy
to take a shower recently.

1:14:12.375 --> 1:14:15.291
It's fine. I can still
identify your scent.

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:19.666
That's not what I'm talking about!

1:14:21.333 --> 1:14:22.458
Thank you.

1:14:22.791 --> 1:14:25.916
I have your scent memorized. I'll find it.

1:14:43.083 --> 1:14:45.083
Platoon One, guard the west side!

1:14:50.083 --> 1:14:51.125
Here you go.

1:14:57.458 --> 1:14:59.250
It was so nice of you to

1:14:59.958 --> 1:15:03.541
choose a location visible
to other nations' spy satellites.

1:15:03.666 --> 1:15:05.166
It must have been difficult.

1:15:26.583 --> 1:15:29.291
The deal is done. Go ahead.

1:15:29.416 --> 1:15:30.833
I understand.

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:39.250
And now...

1:16:01.333 --> 1:16:05.833
You searched directly inside
the Planck brane using a woman's scent?

1:16:06.500 --> 1:16:10.500
For the noble Ultraman to engage
in such licentious behavior...

1:16:10.625 --> 1:16:13.250
"The ends justify the means."

1:16:14.416 --> 1:16:16.416
One of my least favorite sayings.

1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:25.833
Nice catch!

1:16:25.958 --> 1:16:27.000
Okay! Go!

1:16:33.791 --> 1:16:36.083
Mr. Tamura's made a fool of you.

1:16:36.583 --> 1:16:38.541
Wouldn't you say so...

1:16:39.166 --> 1:16:40.833
Mr. Mefilas?

1:16:44.583 --> 1:16:51.125
Instead of destroying the Beta Box, its
fate is now left to the native species...

1:16:56.333 --> 1:16:58.333
"If at first you don't succeed,
try try again."

1:16:58.458 --> 1:17:00.541
One of my least favorite sayings.

1:17:07.333 --> 1:17:09.208
I always provide a full warranty.

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:11.541
Please kindly wait a moment.

1:17:12.916 --> 1:17:15.083
How unfortune it is we must fight...

1:17:15.833 --> 1:17:17.125
Ultraman.

1:17:35.625 --> 1:17:36.708
Mefilas.

1:17:37.291 --> 1:17:40.500
Take your Beta System
and leave this planet.

1:17:40.625 --> 1:17:43.000
Regretfully, I must refuse.

1:18:49.208 --> 1:18:51.333
Spacium Energy sustains you.

1:18:51.458 --> 1:18:54.333
But the load of expanding
from the Planck brane

1:18:54.458 --> 1:18:57.083
as well as maintaining
your fusion with another species

1:18:57.208 --> 1:18:58.666
is causing rapid depletion.

1:18:59.458 --> 1:19:05.041
I can sustain myself with negentropy
but you can only fight for a limited time.

1:19:05.166 --> 1:19:07.750
Will it be long enough
to defeat me, Ultraman?

1:19:25.708 --> 1:19:27.666
This is pointless, Ultraman.

1:19:35.458 --> 1:19:37.583
Unfortunately, I'll have to
step aside here.

1:19:38.375 --> 1:19:43.333
This planet is no longer worth
killing you over.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:49.000
I will take the Beta Box
with me as you requested.

1:19:53.375 --> 1:19:56.375
Why did Mefilas stop fighting?

1:19:56.500 --> 1:20:00.125
It looks like they talked
extraterrestrial to extraterrestrial.

1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:06.250
Talking things out peacefully is
always the best solution.

1:20:16.458 --> 1:20:18.333
Received and accepted.

1:20:19.833 --> 1:20:21.666
There's a complication afoot.

1:20:22.250 --> 1:20:25.416
I should leave before
things get unpleasant.

1:20:26.041 --> 1:20:28.583
Farewell, Ultraman.

1:20:44.458 --> 1:20:49.291
Thank you. You were there for us
all the way back to safety.

1:21:02.250 --> 1:21:04.833
He stayed with us
right up to his limit.

1:21:04.958 --> 1:21:08.833
His one weakness is
his high energy depletion on Earth.

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:14.208
Just relax, let them do their job.

1:21:30.416 --> 1:21:33.000
She gets stressed out so easily.

1:21:33.125 --> 1:21:37.375
Detainment without an arrest warrant
is a human rights violation!

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:42.583
If we are suspected of violation
of our duties, why aren't we in jail?

1:21:42.708 --> 1:21:45.041
The Chief is working to get us restored.

1:21:45.625 --> 1:21:48.250
Plus this is also for our protection.

1:21:49.750 --> 1:21:55.000
Some countries are hinting at nuclear
attacks if we don't give them intel.

1:21:55.125 --> 1:21:57.541
And a US special forces team
has arrived in Japan.

1:21:57.666 --> 1:22:03.208
They surely want to kidnap the SSSP
members who know Ultraman's human form.

1:22:03.333 --> 1:22:05.125
That's why we're protecting them.

1:22:05.250 --> 1:22:06.083
I figured.

1:22:06.208 --> 1:22:09.416
The man who is Ultraman remains in hiding.

1:22:10.250 --> 1:22:14.541
The SSSP holds the vital position
as the only liaison to him.

1:22:15.500 --> 1:22:16.666
Personally...

1:22:17.833 --> 1:22:20.375
I'd like them to return to work
as soon as possible.

1:22:20.500 --> 1:22:22.166
It's true they broke the law.

1:22:22.291 --> 1:22:27.500
But how about we say they were being
coerced by the man who is Ultraman?

1:22:27.625 --> 1:22:31.791
Uh... How about that as an excuse?

1:22:35.333 --> 1:22:36.625
That will work.

1:22:37.041 --> 1:22:38.958
I'll tell that to
the Prime Minister's Office.

1:22:40.166 --> 1:22:41.666
We're free to go.

1:22:42.083 --> 1:22:43.208
Let's get back to HQ.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:44.083
Yes sir!

1:22:48.333 --> 1:22:51.916
Come to think of it, why does
Ultraman take the form of Kaminaga?

1:23:03.916 --> 1:23:07.625
You took this man's life, Lipiah.

1:23:07.750 --> 1:23:11.250
No, I'll call you by the name you've
been given on this planet, Ultraman.

1:23:11.958 --> 1:23:13.041
That's right.

1:23:13.166 --> 1:23:17.583
He lost his life trying to protect
a young human from my impact blast.

1:23:17.708 --> 1:23:22.000
An intriguing life form, one willing to
sacrifice his life for the sake of others.

1:23:22.125 --> 1:23:24.250
I want to understand him.

1:23:24.375 --> 1:23:28.125
So you decided to do the forbidden,
and merge with a human.

1:23:28.250 --> 1:23:29.333
That's right.

1:23:31.875 --> 1:23:34.541
You came as the new emissary
from the Planet of Light?

1:23:34.666 --> 1:23:36.541
My name is Zōffy.

1:23:36.666 --> 1:23:39.250
Because you broke the Code
of the Planet of Light,

1:23:39.375 --> 1:23:43.125
I'm now the watcher of the indigenous
creatures called humans on this planet.

1:23:43.250 --> 1:23:45.625
At the same time, I am their adjudicator.

1:23:45.750 --> 1:23:50.000
The humans of this planet will likely
evolve in the same way as we have.

1:23:50.125 --> 1:23:53.000
Therefore, we have decided
to disposed of them.

1:23:53.125 --> 1:23:58.125
Zōffy, I believe
the planet's decision is a mistake.

1:23:58.250 --> 1:23:59.500
A mistake...

1:23:59.625 --> 1:24:02.750
The mistake was your fusion with a human.

1:24:02.875 --> 1:24:07.041
Each of the billions of humans
can be used as a bioweapon.

1:24:07.166 --> 1:24:09.875
Now, every intelligent life form
in the multiverse knows that.

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:13.250
The best decision is to prune them
all now while we have the chance.

1:24:13.791 --> 1:24:18.625
As the adjudicator, I have brought
the Ultimate Celestial Suppression Weapon.

1:24:19.166 --> 1:24:20.916
You mean Zetton?

1:24:21.041 --> 1:24:22.291
Yes.

1:24:22.875 --> 1:24:25.416
I'm activating its autonomous program,

1:24:25.541 --> 1:24:30.125
that will exterminate the human race
along with the entire star system.

1:24:31.500 --> 1:24:36.375
The Planet of Light has documented
nearly 13 billion intelligent life forms.

1:24:36.500 --> 1:24:40.291
The loss of one will have
no impact on the universe.

1:24:40.791 --> 1:24:43.166
For the inhabitants of this planet...

1:24:43.291 --> 1:24:45.750
<i>One</i> is all there is.

1:25:02.041 --> 1:25:07.041
Is the intelligent life
on this planet worth dying over...

1:25:08.208 --> 1:25:09.458
Ultraman?

1:26:17.666 --> 1:26:19.583
Shouldn't we answer?

1:26:19.708 --> 1:26:23.333
They're just going to ask us to deal
with that thing orbiting the Earth.

1:26:23.458 --> 1:26:25.625
Don't answer unless it's the Chief.

1:26:25.750 --> 1:26:29.541
They just want to make us
get Kaminaga to do something.

1:26:29.666 --> 1:26:31.458
They are depending on Ultraman
for everything now.

1:26:31.583 --> 1:26:34.875
Humans have always
prayed to god when desperate.

1:26:35.500 --> 1:26:37.958
Ultraman is now the closest thing
we have to a god.

1:26:38.500 --> 1:26:40.000
No wonder people cling to him.

1:26:45.916 --> 1:26:47.291
Kaminaga?!

1:26:47.416 --> 1:26:50.041
There's something I must tell you all.

1:26:50.833 --> 1:26:52.166
About the thing in the sky?

1:26:52.291 --> 1:26:54.333
That's right. It's called Zetton.

1:26:54.458 --> 1:26:58.666
I want the details, but you're going to
be in serious trouble if you stay here.

1:27:01.416 --> 1:27:02.750
Shinji Kaminaga...

1:27:04.041 --> 1:27:07.583
or should I call you Ultraman?

1:27:08.166 --> 1:27:10.250
We'd like you to come with us.

1:27:10.375 --> 1:27:13.375
I'm sorry, but right now
I need to talk with my team.

1:27:13.500 --> 1:27:14.583
We can't allow that.

1:27:14.750 --> 1:27:16.916
The government has ratified a treaty

1:27:17.041 --> 1:27:19.541
placing Ultraman under
the joint control of Japan

1:27:19.666 --> 1:27:22.375
and a newly established UN organization.

1:27:23.916 --> 1:27:26.875
Try to understand
Japan's difficult position.

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:30.291
I don't get involved with human society.
I'm merely an observer.

1:27:30.541 --> 1:27:32.208
I am not a threat to you.

1:27:32.333 --> 1:27:37.875
Sadly, an overwhelming majority of the
international community doesn't trust you.

1:27:38.583 --> 1:27:44.083
If you won't come with us, we can't
guarantee the lives of the SSSP.

1:27:46.875 --> 1:27:49.500
Intimidation is a terrible thing
for a human to do.

1:27:50.583 --> 1:27:52.458
If you do that...

1:27:52.875 --> 1:27:56.166
I won't hesitate to wipe out the humans
before Zetton does.

1:27:56.291 --> 1:27:58.875
Isn't that intimidation, too?

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.875
It's negotiating on equal ground.

1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.833
If you wish for humans to live,

1:28:02.958 --> 1:28:05.833
please refrain from futile attempts
to meddle with the SSSP.

1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:09.291
Understood.

1:28:09.916 --> 1:28:12.208
We don't want a zero-sum game.

1:28:12.833 --> 1:28:14.125
We'll back off.

1:28:20.041 --> 1:28:23.458
So Zetton is still in the process of
assembling its attack system.

1:28:23.583 --> 1:28:26.750
Another being from my home planet, Zōffy,
has released control of the weapon.

1:28:26.875 --> 1:28:31.291
Once the weapon is ready, a one-terakelvin
superheated ball of energy

1:28:31.583 --> 1:28:34.000
will be launched without warning
from Zetton toward Earth.

1:28:34.125 --> 1:28:37.708
A one-terakelvin fireball?
That's a trillion degrees!

1:28:37.833 --> 1:28:42.625
That'll evaporate the entire solar system,
affecting an area light-years wide!

1:28:42.750 --> 1:28:44.083
An immensely powerful force.

1:28:45.250 --> 1:28:47.791
Humans can't do anything about that.

1:28:49.666 --> 1:28:51.250
Can Zōffy be reasoned with?

1:28:51.375 --> 1:28:53.291
He follows
the Code of the Planet of Light.

1:28:53.416 --> 1:28:54.750
Our only choice is to defeat Zetton.

1:28:58.500 --> 1:29:02.125
How many thermonuclear weapons
does the world's stockpile contain?

1:29:02.250 --> 1:29:04.750
The equivalent of roughly
two-million kilotons of TNT.

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:06.333
Totally insufficient.

1:29:06.458 --> 1:29:08.083
That won't stop Zetton.

1:29:08.208 --> 1:29:09.583
Obviously!

1:29:09.875 --> 1:29:13.750
We humans are tiny beings
on this tiny Earth.

1:29:13.875 --> 1:29:16.041
To the outside world, we're insignificant.

1:29:16.458 --> 1:29:19.083
Letting Ultraman handle it
is the optimal solution.

1:29:19.875 --> 1:29:22.416
Kaminaga, it's in your hands now.

1:30:42.125 --> 1:30:44.250
Can you defeat Zetton by yourself?

1:30:45.416 --> 1:30:46.750
If you do, you may succeed.

1:30:47.458 --> 1:30:49.541
If you don't, you will not.
This is always true.

1:30:49.666 --> 1:30:50.916
Now I must do.

1:30:54.583 --> 1:30:55.625
All right.

1:30:56.375 --> 1:30:57.625
Let's do it!

1:30:59.000 --> 1:30:59.916
Show some spirit!

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:03.375
<i>Resistance is futile.</i>

1:33:03.500 --> 1:33:07.375
<i>Stand aside and await
humanity's purge, Ultraman.</i>

1:33:07.750 --> 1:33:08.708
<i>No.</i>

1:33:09.208 --> 1:33:11.458
<i>I believe in humans
and I will resist to the end.</i>

1:33:12.291 --> 1:33:14.083
<i>That is my choice.</i>

1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:27.833
You couldn't defeat Zetton.

1:33:28.666 --> 1:33:31.083
You knew you couldn't.

1:33:32.291 --> 1:33:33.666
Kaminaga...

1:33:41.583 --> 1:33:43.208
Ultraman...

1:33:44.750 --> 1:33:46.208
has lost.

1:33:53.083 --> 1:33:54.041
I see.

1:33:54.750 --> 1:34:01.041
The Prime Minister has decided not to
disclose the truth about Zetton to anyone.

1:34:01.166 --> 1:34:06.583
Just do nothing and let humanity
die oblivious as an act of mercy.

1:34:11.125 --> 1:34:12.625
So be it.

1:34:59.458 --> 1:35:02.416
Captain, what are our orders for Zetton?

1:35:04.666 --> 1:35:06.291
To do nothing.

1:35:08.250 --> 1:35:09.791
I see.

1:35:18.958 --> 1:35:21.750
You're still working, Funaberi?

1:35:22.250 --> 1:35:24.416
A bioweapon is still an organism.

1:35:24.541 --> 1:35:27.625
It must have a weakness. I'll find it.

1:35:27.750 --> 1:35:30.375
Living creatures live by
survival of the fittest.

1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:34.291
Weak creatures can become extinct.
Humanity would be no exception.

1:35:34.416 --> 1:35:36.583
If we want to survive,
we have to become strong.

1:35:36.708 --> 1:35:39.125
That's why we have
wisdom, resilience, and courage.

1:35:40.458 --> 1:35:45.083
The godlike Ultraman couldn't beat it.
There's nothing we can do.

1:35:45.208 --> 1:35:49.375
Despair weakens the spirit.
It feels better to have hope.

1:35:49.500 --> 1:35:51.875
Hope? That's ridiculous!

1:35:52.166 --> 1:35:54.291
It doesn't matter what we do!
We're useless.

1:35:54.416 --> 1:35:56.500
Useless.
Totally useless!

1:36:01.708 --> 1:36:03.041
Taki...

1:36:03.375 --> 1:36:05.458
I don't think Kaminaga
believes that.

1:36:19.875 --> 1:36:23.875
<i>First, I apologize for
the situation I caused.</i>

1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:28.916
<i>I forced you to undergo rapid advancement
to ensure the survival of the human race.</i>

1:36:29.041 --> 1:36:31.958
<i>Here are the basic principles
of the Beta System,</i>

1:36:32.083 --> 1:36:37.000
<i>and theorems on higher-dimensional domains
converted into your written language.</i>

1:36:37.500 --> 1:36:40.666
<i>Rather than being given
a completed Beta System device,</i>

1:36:40.791 --> 1:36:45.625
<i>I would like humans to use their knowledge
to create it for themselves.</i>

1:36:45.750 --> 1:36:49.333
<i>How humanity uses it is up to you.</i>

1:36:51.333 --> 1:36:54.541
<i>Lastly, Ultraman is not an omnipotent god.</i>

1:36:54.666 --> 1:36:58.458
<i>Like you, he is a living organism.</i>

1:36:59.250 --> 1:37:02.875
<i>I place my hopes in all of humanity.</i>

1:37:03.541 --> 1:37:06.000
<i>Taki, you take if from here.</i>

1:37:06.708 --> 1:37:08.208
Right.

1:37:09.125 --> 1:37:11.208
If we utilize the
dimensional transfer principle,

1:37:11.333 --> 1:37:15.791
maybe we can shift Zetton's heat energy
into the Planck brane.

1:37:16.791 --> 1:37:19.791
A global summit of scholars
to derive a Zetton attack strategy?

1:37:19.916 --> 1:37:20.708
That's right.

1:37:20.833 --> 1:37:22.166
It's not just about physics.

1:37:22.291 --> 1:37:27.291
We'll gather the whole of human knowledge
and derive a formula for defeating Zetton.

1:37:27.416 --> 1:37:28.666
It's Taki's idea.

1:37:28.791 --> 1:37:34.541
Humanity can survive. We believe utilizing
what Kaminaga left us to be the only way.

1:37:55.541 --> 1:37:59.750
It's a meeting of
the greatest minds in the world,

1:37:59.875 --> 1:38:02.083
but it sure looks funny from here.

1:38:03.333 --> 1:38:04.208
Yeah.

1:38:04.833 --> 1:38:08.500
But that's what's great about it.

1:38:41.708 --> 1:38:42.833
Kaminaga.

1:38:44.416 --> 1:38:49.458
Taki and the others are cultivating
the seed of hope you left for us.

1:38:51.875 --> 1:38:54.041
We humans can be persistent.

1:38:54.583 --> 1:38:56.166
I want you to see it.

1:38:59.958 --> 1:39:01.125
So you have to wake up.

1:39:52.541 --> 1:39:54.833
Zetton has left orbit.

1:39:55.750 --> 1:39:56.583
It's descending.

1:39:57.375 --> 1:40:00.041
It appears to have entered
its final firing position.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:13.041
No! There's no time!

1:40:15.500 --> 1:40:17.625
Wait! We have to talk to you.

1:40:19.125 --> 1:40:25.041
Using your theorem, we were able to
derive a single method to defeat Zetton.

1:40:25.166 --> 1:40:26.625
Igniting the Beta Capsule twice will open

1:40:26.750 --> 1:40:28.625
a sixth-dimensional hole
to the Planck brane.

1:40:28.750 --> 1:40:31.250
You will have 1 millisecond to focus
the resulting gravity wave

1:40:31.375 --> 1:40:34.500
on the Zetton fireball's heat energy
and push Zetton

1:40:34.625 --> 1:40:36.875
through the extradimensional opening
into the Planck brane.

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:37.875
I see.

1:40:38.500 --> 1:40:40.916
After transforming, I have
to hit Zetton in one millisecond.

1:40:41.041 --> 1:40:43.083
Basically, yes.

1:40:43.208 --> 1:40:45.375
What will happen to Ultraman?

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.500
We predict he'll be caught in the event
and sent to some parallel dimension.

1:40:49.625 --> 1:40:50.791
What?!

1:40:50.916 --> 1:40:52.458
Then this plan is out.

1:40:52.583 --> 1:40:55.083
We can't sacrifice you,
even to save humanity.

1:40:55.208 --> 1:40:56.125
It's fine.

1:40:56.250 --> 1:40:58.291
Your future is my top priority.

1:40:58.750 --> 1:41:01.500
My life is but a tool to use to that end.

1:41:09.833 --> 1:41:11.208
I trust you.

1:41:12.250 --> 1:41:13.833
Promise you'll come back.

1:41:25.041 --> 1:41:26.375
See you soon!

1:41:27.583 --> 1:41:28.708
Right.

1:41:29.416 --> 1:41:30.958
Be right back.

1:44:11.708 --> 1:44:14.583
Ultraman. Wake up.

1:44:17.916 --> 1:44:23.250
Without the signal of your desire
to survive, I could not have found you.

1:44:23.375 --> 1:44:27.708
The acceptance of death
is the same as the desire for life.

1:44:27.833 --> 1:44:29.666
Thank you, Zōffy.

1:44:30.208 --> 1:44:34.875
So, to both accept death and thirst
for life is the core of human nature.

1:44:35.250 --> 1:44:37.208
Indeed, humans are fascinating.

1:44:37.625 --> 1:44:41.958
I respect humanity's bravery, intellect,
and vitality that let you defeat Zetton.

1:44:42.625 --> 1:44:45.083
They are too precious to destroy.

1:44:45.625 --> 1:44:47.208
You are injured.

1:44:47.333 --> 1:44:49.958
I will bring you home
and we can leave humans be.

1:44:50.083 --> 1:44:53.666
Come. Let's return
to the Planet of Light, Ultraman.

1:44:53.791 --> 1:44:58.250
Zōffy, I share this body with a human.

1:44:58.833 --> 1:45:03.416
To allow him to live,
I will remain on Earth.

1:45:03.750 --> 1:45:04.875
Ultraman.

1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:09.791
You now understand him so well that you're
willing to sacrifice yourself for him.

1:45:09.916 --> 1:45:12.291
He must understand you as well.

1:45:12.416 --> 1:45:14.375
He will forgive you.

1:45:14.500 --> 1:45:17.541
By fusing with
an organism of this planet...

1:45:18.083 --> 1:45:20.750
I sought to understand him and his people.

1:45:21.291 --> 1:45:26.166
But I believe humans are too complex
to simply understand.

1:45:26.583 --> 1:45:31.916
That's why I wish to become human
and learn more about them.

1:45:32.458 --> 1:45:34.791
And humanity is running out of time.

1:45:35.416 --> 1:45:38.666
Fearing their ability to defeat Zetton,

1:45:38.791 --> 1:45:42.458
other intelligent life forms
will continue to appear on Earth.

1:45:42.750 --> 1:45:46.166
But humanity is very young.

1:45:46.625 --> 1:45:50.583
In order to give them
even the slightest fighting chance...

1:45:50.833 --> 1:45:52.291
I will remain on Earth.

1:45:52.875 --> 1:45:55.708
Ultraman... that's not possible.

1:45:55.833 --> 1:45:59.291
I must return you to the Planet of Light.

1:45:59.750 --> 1:46:02.958
You must face the consequences
of breaking our Code.

1:46:03.083 --> 1:46:04.083
Zōffy.

1:46:04.708 --> 1:46:08.291
In that case, give my life to him.

1:46:08.416 --> 1:46:11.708
I want to leave this body
to the humans of tomorrow.

1:46:11.833 --> 1:46:13.791
Even if it means your death?

1:46:13.916 --> 1:46:15.041
Yes.

1:46:15.583 --> 1:46:19.625
To be human is to accept death.

1:46:20.375 --> 1:46:23.833
Human lives are far shorter than ours.

1:46:24.458 --> 1:46:26.500
I want him to live.

1:46:26.916 --> 1:46:29.416
His partner and friends feel likewise.

1:46:29.958 --> 1:46:31.833
I wish to grant them this.

1:46:32.708 --> 1:46:34.083
Ultraman...

1:46:34.625 --> 1:46:37.250
Have you become so fond of humans.

1:46:39.250 --> 1:46:42.750
Very well. I will grant you your wish.

1:46:43.125 --> 1:46:46.000
Thank you, Zōffy.

1:46:46.875 --> 1:46:50.625
I am going to separate
your body from Kaminaga's.

1:47:06.375 --> 1:47:07.833
Kaminaga!

1:47:08.416 --> 1:47:09.708
Kaminaga...

1:47:09.833 --> 1:47:11.208
Kaminaga!

1:47:16.250 --> 1:47:17.583
Welcome home.

1:47:17.708 --> 1:47:25.125
<i>Because the distant star shined so bright</i>

1:47:26.083 --> 1:47:33.708
<i>I trembled as I ran after its light</i>

1:47:34.791 --> 1:47:42.250
<i>In a cracked mirror,
I stared at a reflection of my past self</i>

1:47:43.250 --> 1:47:50.833
<i>I wanted to be strong,
in awe of everything</i>

1:47:52.666 --> 1:47:55.875
<i>You looked up at a hat</i>

1:47:56.916 --> 1:48:00.083
<i>Fluttering in the wind</i>

1:48:01.166 --> 1:48:05.000
<i>As you went on a long and short journey</i>

1:48:05.333 --> 1:48:09.791
<i>Traces of bygone days</i>

1:48:11.666 --> 1:48:14.333
<i>If you so wish,</i>

1:48:15.083 --> 1:48:19.666
<i>He'll come to your aide
with everything he has</i>

1:48:20.250 --> 1:48:23.875
<i>For now, fear nothing</i>

1:48:24.250 --> 1:48:29.416
<i>And be the only one
to understand the meaning of pain</i>

1:48:45.500 --> 1:48:52.958
<i>A flower about to wilt
said its last words to me</i>

1:48:54.000 --> 1:49:01.625
<i>"Though you may no longer see me,
I'll watch over you from afar"</i>

1:49:02.500 --> 1:49:03.375
<i>Yes</i>

1:49:03.500 --> 1:49:06.583
<i>You're absolutely shattered,</i>

1:49:07.666 --> 1:49:10.875
<i>Your heart's been worn down</i>

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:15.625
<i>The story begins with</i>

1:49:16.083 --> 1:49:20.458
<i>A bit of loneliness</i>

1:49:22.416 --> 1:49:25.083
<i>If the touch of your hand is</i>

1:49:25.833 --> 1:49:30.375
<i>The power of loneliness
that brings us together</i>

1:49:31.000 --> 1:49:34.625
<i>Who has the right to take that away?</i>

1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:40.166
<i>We'll keep seeking each other
until our lives are lost</i>

1:49:48.125 --> 1:49:52.041
<i>From beyond the leaves of the trees,</i>

1:49:52.500 --> 1:49:56.375
<i>A shining star says</i>

1:49:56.750 --> 1:50:00.666
<i>With a level gaze,</i>

1:50:01.041 --> 1:50:05.041
<i>You think of the future</i>

1:50:05.333 --> 1:50:08.458
<i>Unaware,</i>

1:50:08.833 --> 1:50:16.833
<i>We'll keep travelling towards the beyond</i>

1:50:22.458 --> 1:50:25.000
<i>If you so wish,</i>

1:50:25.875 --> 1:50:30.291
<i>He'll come to your aide
with everything he has</i>

1:50:30.958 --> 1:50:34.666
<i>For now, fear nothing</i>

1:50:35.041 --> 1:50:42.125
<i>And be the only one
to understand the meaning of pain</i>

1:50:44.125 --> 1:50:50.583
<i>Show me that slight smile
that resembles that star</i>

1:50:52.083 --> 1:50:58.666
<i>Just be the one
to understand the meaning of pain</i>

1:51:45.041 --> 1:51:47.083
