00:52.100 --> 00:53.400
I have problems.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.500
I told you about this--

>> Hudson, look.

00:57.567 --> 00:59.100
An orange.

Your apartment just got robbed."

Oh my God, I'll be right there.

You guys,

01:50.967 --> 01:52.567
tell Trip I had to leave.

>> Nice to meet you.

01:54.767 --> 02:00.500

All right, somebody hand me

02:01.300 --> 02:01.800
that Pear Pad,

02:01.800 --> 02:03.133
because I'm ready to play

Hey, yo, Hudson,

* Yeah, we papered up

03:36.067 --> 03:38.500
I added the infected big toe.

03:38.500 --> 03:39.667
>> Yeah.

03:39.667 --> 03:43.167
See? That's a nasty big toe.

to make sure he likes it.

03:51.200 --> 03:52.700
>> Hey, you guys.

Here comes Hudson.

03:54.533 --> 04:01.133
>> Look.

04:01.133 --> 04:04.200
I'm a Dirty Blob.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.067
>> Yes, you are.

>> We see that.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.067
to promote the game.

04:10.067 --> 04:10.467
>> Aah.

04:10.467 --> 04:12.733
>> See, that's smart.

04:12.733 --> 04:14.067
>> Hey, hey.

04:14.067 --> 04:16.400
Double G, fired up.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.433
>> Why are you guys

04:21.433 --> 04:23.200
dressed like that?

04:23.200 --> 04:23.667
>> We're going

04:23.667 --> 04:25.533
to a tuxedo hot tub party.

04:25.600 --> 04:29.433
Why is this child dressed

04:29.433 --> 04:32.200
like a giant blueberry?

04:32.267 --> 04:33.067
>> No, no.

04:33.067 --> 04:34.333
He's green, Dub.

04:34.333 --> 04:36.067
Blueberries are blue.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.733
>> I see that he's green.

04:37.733 --> 04:38.333
But they don't make

04:38.333 --> 04:39.267
green berries.

04:39.267 --> 04:39.833
Now, if I would have

04:39.833 --> 04:41.067
came in here and said,

04:41.067 --> 04:41.700
"Hey, why does Hudson

04:41.700 --> 04:43.333
look like a giant greenberry?"

04:43.333 --> 04:44.200
Then everybody would've been

04:44.200 --> 04:45.733
looking at me like Double G

04:48.067 --> 04:50.067
>> Whoa.

04:50.067 --> 04:51.467
>> You could've said avocado!

04:51.467 --> 04:53.333
They're green!

04:53.333 --> 04:58.067
>> Well, I'm glad

04:58.067 --> 05:00.133
you guys could stop by.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.233
>> Oh, wait a minute.

05:01.233 --> 05:01.900
When do I get to check out

05:01.900 --> 05:03.667
that new Dirty Blob game?

05:07.667 --> 05:08.700
>> Thank you.

05:08.700 --> 05:09.433
Now, I'm going to put

05:14.267 --> 05:15.433
>> I'll do it.

05:15.433 --> 05:16.233
>> Oh.

05:16.233 --> 05:16.667

05:16.667 --> 05:17.233
Can you guys give me

05:17.233 --> 05:18.300

05:18.300 --> 05:18.767
>> What?

05:18.767 --> 05:19.333
No.

05:19.333 --> 05:21.300
Ew.

05:21.300 --> 05:21.833
Can't your teacher

05:21.833 --> 05:23.833
just drop you off?

05:23.833 --> 05:28.800
>> Oh...

05:28.800 --> 05:29.533
>> Wait a minute.

05:29.533 --> 05:30.667

Weren't you supposed

05:31.233 --> 05:33.267
to be working with her today?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.567
>> Yeah.

05:35.567 --> 05:38.533
She had an emergency.

05:38.533 --> 05:39.533
>> Yeah, big emergency.

05:39.533 --> 05:40.533
It was urgent.

05:40.533 --> 05:43.633
>> She had an earthquake.

05:43.633 --> 05:46.400
>> Oh, there he is. Okay.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.133
>> Did you trick your teacher

05:47.133 --> 05:47.833
so you can get out of doing

05:47.833 --> 05:49.367
your school work today?

05:49.367 --> 05:52.533
>> Not exactly.

05:52.533 --> 05:53.333
>> Babe?

05:53.333 --> 05:55.600
>> I don't know nothing.

06:17.433 --> 06:18.400
>> Why not?

>> Because when I tell lies

is over.

Not Utah.
