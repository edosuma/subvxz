WEBVTT

00:07.233 --> 00:09.824
BLAIR:
It's not an offer, it's a deal.

00:09.918 --> 00:11.159
They can't do that.

00:11.253 --> 00:13.470
Well, call them back
and tell them that.

00:14.831 --> 00:16.432
(sighs) Hi.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.549
(exhales)

00:54.889 --> 00:57.723
(sighing)

00:59.560 --> 01:00.976

01:02.288 --> 01:03.604
MAN:
Whoa, look at that.

01:14.057 --> 01:16.575
Griffin? Oh, my... (laughs)

01:20.564 --> 01:21.246
Blair,

01:21.398 --> 01:23.990
I know I'm always asking you

01:24.143 --> 01:25.267
to jump with me on the weekends,

01:25.327 --> 01:26.977
but you can
stop worrying about that.

01:27.146 --> 01:29.088
All I want you to do

01:29.315 --> 01:30.964
is take this lover's leap.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.320
You know, we've been a hell of
a team for the last two years.

01:36.338 --> 01:37.579
But it's time
to make it official.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.340
Blair Andrews,
will you marry... (grunts)

01:40.659 --> 01:42.434
(Blair screams)

01:43.437 --> 01:46.021
(Griffin screaming)

01:52.446 --> 01:53.595
Dragged how, ma'am?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.188
<i> He jumped off</i>
<i> a building to propose,</i>

01:55.282 --> 01:56.673
and his parachute
got caught by a car.

01:56.692 --> 01:58.099
Can you describe the vehicle?

01:58.193 --> 02:01.102
Um, it's a pickup, there's a man
in it, he's wearing black.

02:01.122 --> 02:02.270
That's a bank robber.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.331
How do you know that?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.274
All units, all units,

02:06.293 --> 02:08.127
<i> we have a 211 in progress</i>

02:08.278 --> 02:09.670
<i> at the Cal-Am Bank</i>
<i> in Cal Plaza.</i>

02:11.156 --> 02:13.423
<i> -Units are arriving now.</i>
-Oh...

02:14.193 --> 02:16.593
727-L-30 in pursuit.

02:21.367 --> 02:22.558
(grunting)

02:30.967 --> 02:32.109
Hey!

02:36.048 --> 02:37.990
(grunting)

02:42.738 --> 02:45.497
You got nowhere to go.
Pull over.

02:47.501 --> 02:48.333
(truck horn honks)

02:48.485 --> 02:50.577
They gave you decoy money.

02:50.729 --> 02:52.963
You're wasting your time.

02:53.990 --> 02:55.716
(honks horn)

03:06.428 --> 03:08.520
(honks horn)

03:14.937 --> 03:17.029
Door.

03:24.763 --> 03:27.998
Get him out of here
so I can arrest his sorry ass.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.602
(gasping, groaning)

03:32.696 --> 03:34.046
Can you hear me, sir?

03:34.197 --> 03:35.697
-Can you tell me your name?
-Griffin.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.123
Where's Blair? Where is she?

03:37.218 --> 03:38.884
Griffin, I need you
to look at me right now.

03:39.035 --> 03:40.052
Breathing is good.

03:40.203 --> 03:41.703
Pulse is strong.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.371
Do you know
what year it is, Griffin?

03:43.465 --> 03:45.039
The year my life changes
forever. Where the hell is she?

03:45.059 --> 03:47.041
Pupils reactive. Let's get
this helmet off of him.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.209
(Griffin sobs)

03:48.303 --> 03:49.728
Steady. On three, ready?
One, two, three.

03:49.879 --> 03:51.897
All right, we're gonna get
a splint on this, Griffin,

03:51.974 --> 03:54.124
after we give you
something for the pain.

03:54.142 --> 03:55.883
Morphine's going in.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.361
I just want Blair.

03:58.981 --> 04:00.530
Here you go.

04:04.728 --> 04:06.703
(grunts)

04:13.662 --> 04:16.904
Griffin, are you
experiencing muscle spasms?

04:16.999 --> 04:18.815
Your hand is locked.

04:19.985 --> 04:23.136
You held on to that ring,
Griffin. That's really awesome.

04:24.098 --> 04:25.672
BLAIR:
Griffin!

04:25.766 --> 04:26.990
Here she comes.

04:27.083 --> 04:28.267
Griffin, I'm here. I'm here.

04:28.494 --> 04:29.509
I'm here.

04:29.661 --> 04:31.177
Blair. Will you...

04:31.330 --> 04:33.939
(crying):
Yes. Yes. Oh...

04:34.166 --> 04:35.565
All right, let's go.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.656
You can ride with him
if you want, ma'am.

04:43.767 --> 04:45.033
Do I have to?

04:47.696 --> 04:49.454
I mean, I had to say yes, right?

04:49.681 --> 04:51.031
He jumped off a fricking
building for me.

04:51.125 --> 04:52.624
You were gonna say no?

04:52.851 --> 04:54.200
People change

04:54.353 --> 04:56.536
when you put a ring on it.

04:56.688 --> 04:58.021
I liked us how we were.

04:58.040 --> 05:00.382
So, what do you want to do?

05:01.284 --> 05:02.450
I guess I'll wait a few months,

05:02.544 --> 05:04.303
and then break it off.

05:05.531 --> 05:10.517
I heard a proposal gone wrong
can scar a guy for life.

05:12.128 --> 05:14.980
Yeah. I heard that, too.

05:15.131 --> 05:16.982
Oh, give me a break.

05:17.133 --> 05:19.526
(sirens wailing)

05:31.390 --> 05:34.482
HEN: Ooh, I'm so looking
forward to this time off.

05:34.576 --> 05:36.409
Denny's on a sleepover
with Nathaniel.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.986
Karen and I are going to have
ourselves a staycation.

05:39.081 --> 05:40.397
What's the plan?

05:40.490 --> 05:41.414
Curl up on the couch
and watch nothing

05:41.567 --> 05:42.990
but television
that's bad for us.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.325
Well, isn't all
television bad for you?

05:44.419 --> 05:45.569
EDDIE:
That sounds awesome.

05:45.587 --> 05:47.179
I got to figure out
how to say no

05:47.330 --> 05:48.588
to another date
my<i> tía</i> set me up with.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.589
Why don't you just
download a dating app?

05:49.741 --> 05:50.740
I did, but I can't

05:50.926 --> 05:52.684
-bring myself to open it.
-RAVI: Hey, guys,

05:52.836 --> 05:55.245
before you leave, city wants us
to get new parking permits.

05:55.414 --> 05:57.356
-Annoying, but it's procedure.
-BOBBY: All right,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.191
fill them out, leave them on my
desk, and I'll expedite them.

05:59.418 --> 06:01.434
Really gonna work
another double, Chim?

06:01.587 --> 06:02.586
I live here now.

06:02.588 --> 06:04.196
Oh, we love having Chim
on the B-side,

06:04.423 --> 06:06.089
or, as we like to call it,

06:06.182 --> 06:07.199
the A+ side.

06:07.426 --> 06:08.724
Ravi here is
the double-shift king.

06:08.726 --> 06:10.427
-Maybe not for long.
-RAVI: Well, I have an excuse.

06:10.445 --> 06:12.037
I'm saving up to buy property.

06:12.264 --> 06:13.930
Oh, nice. Uh, your first condo?

06:14.023 --> 06:15.356
My third apartment building.

06:15.450 --> 06:18.693
What? That's how you build
generational wealth, right?

06:18.787 --> 06:20.212
Or an empire.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.029
CHIM:
Yeah, well, as soon as I

06:22.124 --> 06:23.289
cover the deductible
on this insurance claim

06:23.442 --> 06:25.550
I'm putting in, I'm donezo.

06:25.702 --> 06:26.776
Chim...

06:26.795 --> 06:29.170
The ring is gone.
I can be sad about it,

06:29.281 --> 06:30.463
but I'll be even sadder

06:30.616 --> 06:32.057
if I eat the cost
of a missing diamond.

06:32.284 --> 06:33.558
So get the insurance money.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.042
Then buy a new ring

06:35.062 --> 06:36.377
and propose.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.729
There's really no reason
why you shouldn't, Chim.

06:37.881 --> 06:39.231
Unless you plan on
buying a duplex.

06:39.458 --> 06:42.049
Guys, I appreciate
what you're trying to do.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.736
But the ring is gone.
It's a sign-- from God,

06:44.963 --> 06:46.796
from Sauron, I don't know.

06:46.890 --> 06:50.575
But I'm going to heed the
warning. It's time to move on.

06:55.474 --> 06:57.165

06:58.326 --> 06:59.325

<i> and, as usual, she left</i>
<i> destruction in her wake.</i>

07:14.435 --> 07:16.601
Good thing we're trained

07:16.753 --> 07:18.328
Oh, there's no amount of
training

07:18.421 --> 07:19.587
that can prepare you
for all of this,

07:19.665 --> 07:22.182

to escape danger.

07:22.334 --> 07:24.184
<i> -Again.</i>
-Yeah, sorry about that.

07:24.336 --> 07:26.019
-You sound tired.
<i> -Eh,</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:27.446
just need some coffee.

07:27.597 --> 07:29.430
Double the shifts,
triple the caffeine.

07:29.450 --> 07:31.524
You have been taking
extra shifts lately.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.433
Is there something

07:32.453 --> 07:34.101
<i> I should be worried about?</i>

07:34.196 --> 07:36.179
Maybe our HVAC system.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.530
Have you heard
the sound it makes

07:37.683 --> 07:39.440
when the air conditioning
kicks in?

07:39.460 --> 07:41.034
Yeah, it's kind of like a whine.

07:41.186 --> 07:42.294
<i> I think it's more of a cry.</i>

07:42.521 --> 07:45.038
A cry for help, Maddie.
Very expensive help.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.873
(alarm ringing)

07:46.967 --> 07:49.025
Uh, speaking of expensive help,
I got to go.

07:49.027 --> 07:50.469
Be safe out there. Love you.

-Hi.

12:51.496 --> 12:52.771
Buck after a few tequilas.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.163
Or mezcal.

12:54.257 --> 12:55.422
I mean, some pretty crazy things

12:55.517 --> 12:56.941
have been known
to happen, am I right?

12:57.168 --> 12:58.184
Really good to see you, Lucy.

12:58.336 --> 12:59.852
NATALIA:
So you said

13:00.005 --> 13:00.670
you had some stories?

13:00.763 --> 13:02.171
You know, we were actually

13:02.190 --> 13:03.764
about to close our tab...

13:03.933 --> 13:05.008
MAN:
Donato, you're up.

13:05.101 --> 13:06.618
Oh, saved by the eight ball.

13:06.769 --> 13:08.861
-Nice meeting you.
-You, too.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.013
Bye, Buck.

13:10.031 --> 13:11.664
See you. (soft chuckle)

13:13.794 --> 13:15.126
Thank you.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.462
Uh, hey, what do you
think the tip is?

13:17.689 --> 13:19.613
They give you three options
right down here.

13:19.691 --> 13:21.574
-Right. (chuckles)
-Are you all right?

13:21.726 --> 13:23.635
Uh, yeah. No. I don't know

13:23.862 --> 13:25.637
why I-I couldn't figure it out.

13:25.864 --> 13:26.879
You're flustered.

13:27.032 --> 13:28.455
-Flust...
-Mm-hmm.

13:28.475 --> 13:31.142
Oh, because of Lucy?
No, that-that was never a thing.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.052
Well, it-it was one thing...

13:33.204 --> 13:35.129
-Hmm.
-...and then it was nothing.

13:35.223 --> 13:36.314
Which thing, tequila or mezcal?

13:36.465 --> 13:38.691
It was nothing, I promise.

13:48.903 --> 13:50.495
Well, I'm glad to hear
Lucy's doing well

13:50.646 --> 13:51.645
over at Air Support.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.647
Yeah, did-did she request
to not come back?

13:53.667 --> 13:56.501
No, no, no, not at all. She's
just looking to get promoted.

13:56.728 --> 13:58.319
They might have some spots
available in the upper ranks.

13:58.413 --> 13:59.486
Captain Donato.
Knew that one was coming.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.898
So your day off
went as good as mine.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.232
CHIMNEY:
Did you get a rabies shot?

14:03.251 --> 14:04.825
No, that would have been
more interesting.

14:04.919 --> 14:07.512
Hiking and golfing in the
same day? Sounds like you were

14:07.663 --> 14:09.163
out there looking for signs,
too, Eddie.

14:09.257 --> 14:11.182
You know I don't believe
in that stuff.

14:11.409 --> 14:13.017
I just want what I had
when I met Shannon.

14:13.169 --> 14:14.835
It just happened.

14:14.929 --> 14:16.003
It was magic.

14:16.097 --> 14:17.580
Oh, so you believe in magic.

14:17.599 --> 14:19.006
I believe in chemistry.

14:19.100 --> 14:20.249
Ah, it's science.

14:20.268 --> 14:21.601
-I get it.
-BUCK: Back to magic.

14:21.753 --> 14:23.603
Weren't you guys in
the 12th grade when you met?

14:23.697 --> 14:26.272
Eighth, then we lost touch
and reconnected in 12th.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.591
Okay, so that's what it is.
You-you suck at it.

14:28.610 --> 14:29.868
All right, Buck, come on.

14:30.111 --> 14:32.428
Come on. I mean, if he met
his wife when they were kids,

14:32.447 --> 14:34.873
he just...
he hasn't really dated.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.115
So he sucks at it.

14:36.267 --> 14:37.876
-Yes.
-HEN: Clearly,

14:38.027 --> 14:40.295
you've mastered it, Buck.

14:41.864 --> 14:43.464
(honks horn)

14:47.370 --> 14:49.278
Buck, Eddie, saws and jaws.

14:49.297 --> 14:51.681
Although my money's on saws.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.968
Oh, great. You're here.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.379
Can we just keep going and you
can pull me out at the church?

14:58.473 --> 15:01.215
I'm sorry, I don't think
that's an option.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.351
BOBBY:
Let's get that top off, guys.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.904
-So, what's your name?
-Lois.

15:06.055 --> 15:07.130
Lois Gilbertson.

15:07.148 --> 15:08.981
Soon to be Mrs. Phillip Garrity.

15:09.134 --> 15:10.408
Congratulations.

15:10.559 --> 15:11.968
Weddings seem to be
a running theme for us lately.

15:11.986 --> 15:14.061
LOIS:
Yes, running is good.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.397
How about some galloping?

15:16.491 --> 15:18.399
Aren't you the captain?
I mean, it says so

15:18.418 --> 15:20.418
-on your hat, right?
-Yeah.

15:21.663 --> 15:23.454
You got to get me to the church.

15:23.681 --> 15:25.314
-EDDIE: Cap.
-Yeah?

15:25.333 --> 15:26.240
EDDIE:
I'm not sure.

15:26.334 --> 15:28.242
But it looks like termites.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.335
No, that's dry rot.

15:29.487 --> 15:30.653
Well, you think we can clear

15:30.746 --> 15:32.096
enough of that away
to pull her out of there?

15:32.323 --> 15:34.507
Afraid not. Gonna...

15:34.601 --> 15:36.601
-(whispering): We're gonna
need those saws.
-What?

15:36.828 --> 15:38.511
Oh, no.
Are you out of your mind?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.329
You're not getting that
anywhere near my dress.

15:40.331 --> 15:42.181
We have a plan for that, Lois.

15:42.333 --> 15:43.775
Uh, ma'am-- Lois-- is it okay

15:44.002 --> 15:45.777
if we maybe just move
your dress a little?

15:45.928 --> 15:48.529
LOIS:
Just get me out of here, please.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.431
Ah!

15:50.525 --> 15:51.691
CHIMNEY:
Okay, Lois, that
could be a sprain.

15:51.843 --> 15:53.359
Hold tight while I take a look.

15:53.511 --> 15:54.994
HEN:
Okay.

15:56.848 --> 15:58.665
This is a lot of dress.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.369
(saw whirring)

16:04.414 --> 16:07.523
-Is this a vow renewal?
-No, it is not.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.375
Today, I am marrying

16:09.527 --> 16:11.360
the love of my life.
Phillip Garrity.

16:11.362 --> 16:13.805
We went steady
back at Pacoima High,

16:14.032 --> 16:15.139
a very long time ago.

16:15.291 --> 16:16.382
Not quite horse-and-buggy time,

16:16.534 --> 16:18.125
if that's what you're thinking,
but...

16:18.219 --> 16:20.311
(chuckles) Not at all.

16:20.463 --> 16:21.479
1969.

16:21.706 --> 16:24.298
Neil Armstrong
landed on the Moon,

16:24.317 --> 16:25.632
and I landed my first kiss.

16:25.727 --> 16:27.634
We went to different colleges,

16:27.729 --> 16:28.987
promised we'd stay in touch,

16:29.138 --> 16:30.880
-but...
-You lost touch.

16:30.973 --> 16:31.897
I was afraid.

16:31.974 --> 16:34.217
But by the time I met the man

16:34.235 --> 16:36.569
that was my new husband,
I just, uh,

16:36.721 --> 16:38.312
I wasn't the same person.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.056
But we had
a great life together,

16:40.074 --> 16:42.649
and-and Phil had a lovely wife.

16:42.744 --> 16:44.485
It's just that we found each
other recently on The Facebook,

16:44.562 --> 16:47.338
-and we were both alone again.
-(chuckling)

16:47.490 --> 16:50.399
And we knew.
We were meant to be.

16:50.418 --> 16:52.635
-When you know, you know.
-Mm-hmm.

16:56.257 --> 16:57.865
BOBBY:
Okay, we're clear.

16:57.925 --> 17:00.910
-All right, on my count.
-Yeah, okay.

17:01.003 --> 17:02.562
One, two, three.

17:05.674 --> 17:08.026
Good, I-I'll be a little late,

17:08.177 --> 17:09.193
but I'll still make it.

17:09.420 --> 17:10.936
Lois, we have to
take you to the hospital

17:11.031 --> 17:12.421
-to get you checked out.
-No.

17:12.440 --> 17:13.531
Lois, we don't have a choice.

17:13.758 --> 17:16.016
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.869
A long time ago,

17:18.020 --> 17:18.944
I made the wrong choice.

17:19.097 --> 17:21.205
Yes, my life has been beautiful,

17:21.357 --> 17:23.857
my children are gonna
be there today,

17:23.951 --> 17:25.117
but don't you see?

17:25.211 --> 17:26.860
This is my chance.

17:26.954 --> 17:28.454
Maybe my last chance.

17:28.548 --> 17:32.366
You have to let me do this.
You have to.

17:32.460 --> 17:35.702
You have to let me choose love.

17:35.797 --> 17:37.947
I can do that.

the question?

No, he did not,
which answers my question,

19:16.138 --> 19:17.137
or at least one of them.

19:17.231 --> 19:18.547

19:22.162 --> 19:24.495

why are you wearing it?

19:24.647 --> 19:26.813
Because I found it,

19:26.908 --> 19:28.240
and I was looking at it,

19:28.334 --> 19:30.150
and, you know, I tried it on.

Uh, yeah, sure. Come over here.

You know, forget it.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.253
I'm not gonna cut it off
because it's my engagement ring.

19:57.346 --> 19:58.845
Uh, technically,
you're not engaged yet.

19:58.940 --> 20:00.198
He hasn't asked,
you haven't accepted.

20:00.425 --> 20:02.441
Which brings me
to my next question.

20:02.593 --> 20:03.868
-Why didn't he ask?
-Uh, he lost the ring,

20:04.019 --> 20:05.611
then he lost his mind.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.430
We were on a call, we came back,

20:07.448 --> 20:08.614
the ring was gone,
he was convinced

20:08.708 --> 20:11.042
we were hazing him.
Things got kind of tense.

20:11.193 --> 20:12.859

he should propose.

20:17.032 --> 20:19.032
Anyway, we tore up
the whole firehouse

20:19.126 --> 20:20.701
trying to find it, but...

20:20.869 --> 20:22.035
nothing.

we should get married?

21:31.958 --> 21:33.106
Well, tastier, I guess.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.034
You know, they do
have pre-fab models.

21:35.186 --> 21:36.869
Oh, I'm aware.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.203
-So is Chris.
-Hmm.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.298
That boy has the heart
of an engineer.

21:40.449 --> 21:43.134
-Likes to overthink everything.
-Ah, an overthinker.

21:43.285 --> 21:45.528
-Uh-huh.
-Apple doesn't fall
very far, huh?

21:45.621 --> 21:46.545
Yeah.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.141
So, hiking and
golfing in one day?

21:50.292 --> 21:52.310
Okay, I'm not proud of it.

21:52.461 --> 21:55.888
(chuckles) Eddie,
I know how hard this is.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.373
One thing you can't do

21:57.542 --> 21:58.482
is compare what you had

21:58.634 --> 22:00.392
with what you think
you're gonna have.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.394
You just have to be open
to whatever comes.

22:02.547 --> 22:03.637
Oh, plywood.

22:03.731 --> 22:05.740
Need that for the base.

22:07.718 --> 22:08.642
Ah.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.745
-There you go.
-All right.

22:15.001 --> 22:16.500
(mutters)

22:16.652 --> 22:18.151
So how'd you make it happen
for you and Athena?

22:18.171 --> 22:20.896
We got called
to a motorcycle accident.

22:20.915 --> 22:22.064
It was a bad one.

22:22.157 --> 22:24.249
I wasn't at my best at the time.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.094
Needed to take a minute.
She sat with me.

22:28.072 --> 22:29.013
Eventually, I asked her

22:29.164 --> 22:31.256
to go to church,
and we prayed together.

22:31.409 --> 22:32.424
Wow.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.742
And a few days later,
we had dinner,

22:33.836 --> 22:35.186
things grew from there, and now

22:35.355 --> 22:36.929
we're about to have
our fourth anniversary.

22:37.081 --> 22:39.431
(chuckles) So you definitely
weren't looking for it.

22:39.584 --> 22:41.025
When you met Shannon,
how old were you?

22:41.176 --> 22:43.361
-14.
-How'd you make that happen?

22:43.512 --> 22:46.030
I, uh, didn't.

22:47.274 --> 22:48.574
Right.

23:02.197 --> 23:03.789
They sent the police?

23:03.941 --> 23:05.441
The paramedics are
on their way, ma'am.

23:05.459 --> 23:07.218
I just happened
to get here first.

23:07.369 --> 23:09.035
Oh, right.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.055
They said something about that.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.789
Are you Ella?

23:20.808 --> 23:21.957
Yeah.

23:22.068 --> 23:25.127
I'm just here as a matter
of procedure, Ella.

23:25.220 --> 23:27.387
Could you tell me
when he passed?

23:27.407 --> 23:29.073
Just now.

23:29.224 --> 23:31.409
I was doing the dishes,

23:31.636 --> 23:34.728
and the monitor
started to go off.

23:34.822 --> 23:36.497
His heart stopped.

23:41.312 --> 23:44.813
I think I have some paperwork

23:44.832 --> 23:46.090
from his doctor.

23:47.576 --> 23:49.910
ATHENA:
That's okay. I see it here.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.595
(sighs)

23:52.840 --> 23:55.415
How long has he been
under home care?

23:55.584 --> 23:57.326
Since this morning.

23:57.419 --> 23:59.419
I mean, they just set it up.

23:59.513 --> 24:02.498
Nick was diagnosed with
grade three Oligodendroglioma

24:02.591 --> 24:04.090
seven weeks ago.

24:04.185 --> 24:06.351
Brain cancer.

24:06.504 --> 24:08.671
Inoperable.

24:08.689 --> 24:09.930
They hit him with everything

24:10.065 --> 24:13.509
they could, but it was
spreading too fast,

24:13.527 --> 24:16.011
so they decided
this was the best option.

24:16.030 --> 24:19.181
And they left you here alone?

24:19.200 --> 24:20.516
Well, they were gonna
order some takeout,

24:20.685 --> 24:23.502
and I told them they
should go grab a bite.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.114
Wait.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.876
You think I did
something to Nick

24:31.028 --> 24:32.044
while they were gone.

24:32.138 --> 24:35.556
Why don't we have a seat?

24:37.960 --> 24:39.518
Ella?

24:45.543 --> 24:48.393
I said I was here
as a matter of procedure.

24:48.546 --> 24:51.304
Your husband's death is
what we call "unattended."

24:51.398 --> 24:54.717
There was no medical
professional present.

24:54.735 --> 24:56.385
Ella,

24:56.478 --> 24:58.162
I need to advise you
of your rights.

24:58.313 --> 25:00.405
It happened so fast.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.057
Seven weeks.

25:02.150 --> 25:03.225
I can't imagine

25:03.285 --> 25:04.409
what you must be feeling.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.911
I don't mean the cancer.

25:06.063 --> 25:08.339
It was a shock, yeah,

25:08.490 --> 25:12.009
but everything about us
moved so crazy fast.

25:12.995 --> 25:14.762
We only met five years ago.

25:15.906 --> 25:17.515
Right over there.

25:17.742 --> 25:18.741
I threw a game night.

25:18.834 --> 25:20.409
A friend of mine
invited him over.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.853
We played Pictionary that night.

25:23.005 --> 25:25.264
Nick is a... was...

25:25.358 --> 25:27.173
a really good graphic designer,

25:27.268 --> 25:28.600
so he was really good at it.

25:28.753 --> 25:31.270
We felt like we were
breaking the rules.

25:31.422 --> 25:33.680
We're both big rule followers.

25:33.699 --> 25:36.450
But hey, we won fair and square.

25:37.352 --> 25:39.495
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

25:41.265 --> 25:43.615
We had an entire life
planned and now...

25:43.709 --> 25:46.769
We never even made it
to our fourth anniversary.

25:46.787 --> 25:49.529
I was going to get him flowers.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.031
He hated them. (laughs)

25:51.050 --> 25:53.776
I knew he would want them

25:53.869 --> 25:57.054
because flowers are the official
fourth anniversary gift.

25:57.205 --> 25:59.706
He was a rule follower.

25:59.725 --> 26:00.724
Yeah.

26:02.787 --> 26:04.970
I lost someone when I was about

26:05.064 --> 26:06.638
your age.

26:06.791 --> 26:08.457
My fiancé.

26:08.475 --> 26:10.401
We had our
whole lives ahead of us,

26:10.628 --> 26:11.384
but it was cut short.

26:11.462 --> 26:13.571
How long were you together?

26:13.722 --> 26:14.738
Two years.

26:14.890 --> 26:16.890
How did you survive?

26:17.026 --> 26:19.985
I didn't think I could.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.321
It seemed impossible,

26:22.473 --> 26:27.326
like climbing a mountain
that keeps on going.

26:27.478 --> 26:29.253
All the while,
you're carrying so much pain

26:29.363 --> 26:31.255
that you can barely move.

26:31.482 --> 26:36.576
And that pain is
the pain of memory. Of loss.

26:36.670 --> 26:39.321
But you can't carry it around.

26:40.324 --> 26:42.766
Don't make the same mistake
that I did.

26:42.993 --> 26:44.493
Cry.

26:44.511 --> 26:49.164
Let the physical loss
hurt as much as it needs to.

26:49.183 --> 26:52.943
But also realize that every
memory that you have of Nick

26:53.095 --> 26:55.762
is filled with love.

26:55.781 --> 26:57.172
It'll be with you.

26:57.265 --> 27:00.008
You'll feel it every day,

27:00.027 --> 27:03.329
because love never dies.

27:12.447 --> 27:15.540
There's a needle in the top
drawer of his nightstand.

27:15.635 --> 27:17.951
Hydromorphone. Ten cc's.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.045
-Ella...
-I couldn't do it.

27:20.197 --> 27:21.546
We talked about it

27:21.699 --> 27:24.457
and-and we worked it out.
It's legal in California now,

27:24.477 --> 27:28.604
but that's not how
either of us were raised.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.132
Rule followers till the end.

27:32.226 --> 27:33.542
I know my rights.

27:33.560 --> 27:36.111
You can ask me
anything you want.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.619

(sighs)

30:53.335 --> 30:55.410
So then we went back
to try and find the ring,

30:55.429 --> 30:56.761
but, you know...

30:56.856 --> 30:58.747
<i> WOMAN (on phone):</i>
<i> It was a landfill.</i>

30:58.765 --> 31:01.416
<i> Okay, Mr. Han, I think</i>
<i> I've got all the information</i>

31:01.509 --> 31:03.176
<i> I need to file</i>

31:03.195 --> 31:06.113

31:19.044 --> 31:20.619
<i> I'm-I'm sorry?</i>

31:20.695 --> 31:24.464
Signs, you know, like from God,
or the universe or whatever.

31:26.126 --> 31:28.793
You're gonna propose,
but then you lose the ring.

31:28.888 --> 31:32.447
That's a sign, right?
You're not supposed to propose.

31:32.466 --> 31:35.041
<i> I meant questions</i>
<i> about your insurance policy.</i>

31:35.060 --> 31:37.619
But then, the last few days,
everywhere I turn,

31:37.712 --> 31:40.288
it's proposals and weddings.

31:40.382 --> 31:44.309
I have to wonder if maybe
I misread the previous sign,

31:44.461 --> 31:45.569
or...

31:46.647 --> 31:49.389
...if I'm reading too much
into the more recent signs.

31:50.467 --> 31:53.368
<i> I'm not sure what</i>
<i> the question is, Mr. Han.</i>

31:58.976 --> 32:00.584
Do I propose or not, Gina?

32:01.645 --> 32:03.995
<i> Uh, Mr. Han,</i>
<i> it's not for me to...</i>

32:04.148 --> 32:06.314
Yeah, I know, I know, but...

32:07.484 --> 32:09.834
...you've just had to
transcribe this entire story,

32:09.987 --> 32:12.220
so I'm sure
you've got an opinion.

32:13.432 --> 32:17.601
Come on, Gina. Please?
You're my only lifeline.

32:20.497 --> 32:22.105
<i> I think people look for signs</i>

32:22.257 --> 32:24.524
<i> when they're afraid</i>
<i> of making a choice.</i>

32:26.170 --> 32:28.445
<i> Afraid to make the wrong one.</i>

32:30.007 --> 32:31.615
(sighs)

32:31.766 --> 32:33.266
Ouch.

32:33.393 --> 32:36.662
Brutal, but probably accurate.

32:38.606 --> 32:40.290
Are you married, Gina?

32:41.126 --> 32:42.775
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...

32:42.795 --> 32:45.045
<i> Divorced. Twice.</i>

32:47.374 --> 32:49.549
You ever regret saying yes?

32:52.137 --> 32:54.763
<i> I regret the result, Mr. Han.</i>

32:56.458 --> 32:58.725
<i> I don't regret the attempt.</i>

33:04.374 --> 33:05.732
(chuckles)

33:08.045 --> 33:11.655
Okay. Uh, thanks
so much for your time, Gina.

33:11.806 --> 33:13.973
I really, really appreciate it.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.076
<i> You're very welcome.</i>

33:27.506 --> 33:29.131
(knock on door)

33:35.830 --> 33:36.829
Maddie?

33:36.923 --> 33:38.598
Hey.

33:42.003 --> 33:43.336
Is something wrong?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.430
Yeah, I think there might be.
I found the ring.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.265
W-Where? How?

33:47.417 --> 33:49.175
-Did you tell Chim?
-No, I got the feeling

33:49.194 --> 33:50.510
that I wasn't
supposed to know

33:50.604 --> 33:52.512
he'd bought it,
but I also got the feeling

33:52.606 --> 33:54.422
that you don't think
he should've bought it.

33:55.517 --> 33:58.201
Maddie, I-I don't--
I don't know what Buck told you,

33:58.428 --> 33:59.536
but that's not what I said.

33:59.763 --> 34:01.204
Then what did you say?

34:01.356 --> 34:04.115
That you both have
been through so much...

34:04.209 --> 34:05.784
You mean I put him
through so much.

34:05.936 --> 34:07.360
That's not what I s...

34:07.379 --> 34:09.046
I left him and Jee for a reason.

34:09.197 --> 34:11.606
Yes. To protect them.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.124
But you have to understand

34:13.277 --> 34:15.701
that that's why I said
what I did to Chimney.

34:15.721 --> 34:16.702
I was...

34:16.722 --> 34:18.037
trying to protect him, too.

34:18.131 --> 34:21.299
-From me.
-Mmm, from himself.

34:21.376 --> 34:23.635
He was so stressed out
about whether or not

34:23.729 --> 34:26.288
he should propose, I just...

34:26.381 --> 34:28.690
I just wanted him
to take a breath.

34:30.977 --> 34:32.694
Maybe you should, too.

34:37.892 --> 34:38.817
(sighs) The program

34:38.911 --> 34:41.303
in Boston, it...

34:41.321 --> 34:42.487
it taught me a lot.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.730
It didn't teach me how
to reconnect with people

34:44.808 --> 34:45.957
in my life.

34:48.253 --> 34:49.252
Maddie,

34:49.438 --> 34:51.996
you don't have to
ever be embarrassed

34:52.091 --> 34:53.998
about what you went through.

34:54.093 --> 34:56.426
We all have our scars.

34:56.653 --> 34:59.821
Why haven't you told Chim
you found the ring?

34:59.914 --> 35:02.599
Because it's more than just
words and a piece of paper,

35:02.826 --> 35:04.492
you know?

35:04.586 --> 35:06.770
There's a power
that we give away.

35:07.589 --> 35:09.797
I just didn't know that
the first time around,

35:09.799 --> 35:11.691
until after.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.319
But he's Chim.

35:15.522 --> 35:16.929
He's not that guy.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.506
And you,

35:18.525 --> 35:22.702
you aren't that same person
that you were back then.

35:24.939 --> 35:26.623
It's stuck.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.458
(laughs)

35:29.686 --> 35:30.702
Do you want me to help you

35:30.796 --> 35:32.129
get that off?

35:40.788 --> 35:42.139
Uh, and-and that's everyone.

35:42.366 --> 35:45.308
I think. I-I hope that's not

35:45.460 --> 35:46.643
too much.

35:46.870 --> 35:47.644
No.

35:47.871 --> 35:51.731
Wow, that is a life well-lived.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.985
I don't think
I've ever met anybody

35:55.136 --> 35:56.319
-quite like you.
-(chuckles)

35:56.546 --> 35:59.305
You're "all in"
about everything.

35:59.399 --> 36:00.991
-It's a lot.
-(chuckles)

36:01.142 --> 36:03.401
But I guess I can be a lot, too.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.904
Well, you know what
they say, right?

36:05.998 --> 36:08.373
More is more.

36:10.151 --> 36:12.127
(knocking on door)

36:13.063 --> 36:15.188
Um, can you...

36:15.248 --> 36:16.414
give me... give me just one sec.

36:16.566 --> 36:17.632
I'm-I'm sorry.

36:19.419 --> 36:20.660
Uh...

36:20.754 --> 36:21.845
I don't know what
I'm going to do about Connor.

36:21.996 --> 36:23.680
Uh, we had a fight.

36:23.907 --> 36:24.997
Another fight, and I just,

36:25.091 --> 36:26.090
I-I had to get out of there.

36:26.185 --> 36:28.852
-Can I come in?
-Well... Um...

36:29.003 --> 36:30.336
-Oh. Hi.
-Hi.

36:30.430 --> 36:32.522
I'm so sorry.

36:32.674 --> 36:33.839
I'm-I'm interrupting.

36:33.859 --> 36:36.008
Uh, it's-it's okay.
Give me a sec.

36:36.028 --> 36:37.936
Just one second. Um...

36:38.088 --> 36:40.530
-uh, what's going on?
-He's driving me insane.

36:40.682 --> 36:42.199
I-I feel like he's not
present for this marriage

36:42.426 --> 36:45.610
or this impending family.

36:45.762 --> 36:47.520
I feel like I'm doing
this all by myself,

36:47.539 --> 36:48.613
and I'm just...

36:48.707 --> 36:50.432
I'm scared and
I don't know what to do.

36:50.450 --> 36:52.709
Okay, well,
just try and relax, okay?

36:52.860 --> 36:57.196
Relax? Relax. I... Buck,
I don't have time to relax.

36:57.290 --> 36:58.606
I mean, this baby's gonna
be here before we know it,

36:58.700 --> 37:00.217
and, I mean,
if he's this checked out now,

37:00.444 --> 37:02.868
what is it gonna be like
when he's, you know...

37:02.963 --> 37:04.170
Um, okay, K-K-Kameron.

37:04.281 --> 37:06.372
I need a place to stay.

37:06.391 --> 37:08.800
(sighs) Um...

37:08.952 --> 37:10.209
One second.

37:10.229 --> 37:13.788
Well, I guess I wasn't wrong
about "all in."

37:13.790 --> 37:17.484
I'm just the donor, okay?
Connor is the father.

37:18.795 --> 37:21.629
I know this is something
easy to judge, but...

37:21.723 --> 37:23.314
No, I'm not judging. It's...

37:23.467 --> 37:25.650
It's an amazing thing
to do for someone.

37:25.727 --> 37:26.818
I'm just...

37:26.912 --> 37:28.319
I'm gonna need a minute

37:28.472 --> 37:30.997
-to take it in.
-Of course.

37:36.496 --> 37:39.673
Thank you for dinner.
It was incredible.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.634
Take care of yourself.

37:43.578 --> 37:44.744
BUCK:
Wh-- Uh...

37:44.838 --> 37:46.579
Hey, h-hold on.

37:46.748 --> 37:48.172
Natalia. What.. Hey, wait.

37:48.325 --> 37:49.766
Come on, you don't need to...

37:49.993 --> 37:50.934
Come on.

37:51.085 --> 37:52.978
(sighs)

37:59.611 --> 38:01.503
-Mmm.
-(sighs)

38:01.596 --> 38:04.930
Wow. She seemed nice.

38:04.950 --> 38:07.075
Did you make this?

38:14.626 --> 38:17.443
-Hey.
-Hi. You hungry?

38:17.462 --> 38:19.354
I didn't hear you come
to bed last night.

38:19.372 --> 38:20.446
Yeah, it was late,

38:20.465 --> 38:22.540
and I didn't want
to wake you or the baby.

38:22.692 --> 38:24.208
Then you succeeded.

38:24.361 --> 38:25.785
Maddie, I have something

38:25.804 --> 38:27.679
that I want to say.

38:28.548 --> 38:30.214
Wha... Maddie, you f...

38:30.367 --> 38:32.383
You found it?
This is incredible.

38:32.477 --> 38:34.052
How did you even...
Where-where-where was it?

38:34.146 --> 38:35.703
-It doesn't matter.
-Doesn't matter?

38:35.722 --> 38:36.980
Do you know how insane I've
been looking for this thing?

38:37.131 --> 38:38.356
Yes, I am aware

38:38.542 --> 38:39.874
because I talked
to Buck and Hen.

38:39.893 --> 38:42.986
Maddie, I-I-I'm
in a different place

38:43.137 --> 38:44.696
-right now...
-Stop.

38:46.383 --> 38:47.973
(exhales)

38:48.142 --> 38:49.492
Howard Han...

38:50.329 --> 38:53.721
...from the moment that we met,

38:53.740 --> 38:55.332
I knew that I had found someone

38:55.408 --> 38:57.083
who would always
be there for me.

38:57.911 --> 38:59.227
I knew it, I just...

38:59.245 --> 39:01.729
I couldn't believe it.
(exhales)

39:02.674 --> 39:05.583
And there are so many people
who would never survive

39:05.735 --> 39:08.345
what I've been through
because they're alone.

39:08.496 --> 39:09.995
But I had you.

39:10.073 --> 39:12.182
You're my lifeline.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.909
And it is really funny,
you losing this ring

39:14.928 --> 39:16.911
and me finding it.

39:16.913 --> 39:18.596
It turned out
to be a total blessing

39:18.690 --> 39:21.416
because it just reminded us

39:21.434 --> 39:23.676
why we're so perfect together,
and it brought us

39:23.770 --> 39:26.363
right back to where
we're supposed to be.

39:27.924 --> 39:29.699
Jee, we're ready.

39:31.928 --> 39:33.428
Good job, baby.

39:34.355 --> 39:37.582
Let me see.
Uh, okay. (clears throat)

39:38.952 --> 39:40.377
Howard Han...

39:41.195 --> 39:43.605
...will you marry us?

39:43.623 --> 39:45.123
(laughs)

39:45.867 --> 39:47.759
-Finger. Yeah.
-Oh, right, right.

39:50.797 --> 39:51.963
(both sniffle)

39:52.099 --> 39:54.616
Yes, I will marry you.
