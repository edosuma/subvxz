What, are we ready?

00:30.375 --> 00:31.541
OK.

00:31.583 --> 00:33.291
All right, settle
everyone, please.

00:33.333 --> 00:34.500
Quiet on the set.

00:34.541 --> 00:35.541
OK, let's do this.

00:37.833 --> 00:40.291
What I want you to do is
when the camera starts

00:40.333 --> 00:43.291
moving forward, just
start to drift back

00:43.333 --> 00:46.291
to that day, that moment,

00:46.333 --> 00:49.791
when you knew, right?

00:49.833 --> 00:52.000
And roll sound.

00:52.041 --> 00:53.458

00:53.500 --> 00:54.666

01:04.500 --> 01:07.833
I'm not in love,

01:07.875 --> 01:11.625
so don't forget it,

01:11.666 --> 01:15.541
it's just a silly phase
I'm going through.

01:18.875 --> 01:23.333
And just because, I caught--

01:32.000 --> 01:32.916
What happened?

01:47.875 --> 01:49.250
[music playing]

03:08.583 --> 03:11.458
Now, he was master of the world.

03:11.500 --> 03:14.541
And though he was not
quite sure what to do next,

03:14.583 --> 03:16.250
he would think of something.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.416
He's going to throw a grenade.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.958
What did you even need it
to be a zebra for, anyway?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.291
It's for one of my films.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.625
You don't understand.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.541
You're not a filmmaker.

05:05.583 --> 05:08.708
I'm trying real hard
to understand you.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.708
On the good news front,
he did promise the horse

05:10.750 --> 05:12.958
would be brown again by dinner.

[music playing]

05:41.916 --> 05:43.208
[laughter]

06:06.166 --> 06:07.666
So I was thinking.

06:07.708 --> 06:11.000
Maybe it's time we thought
about adopting another baby.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.833
How many babies do you
want to have, exactly?

06:13.875 --> 06:16.125
A dozen?

06:16.166 --> 06:17.958
I'm not sure--

06:18.000 --> 06:20.541
Jesus Christ.

06:20.583 --> 06:23.875
Editing is when you see
something in your story

06:23.916 --> 06:27.166
that you don't like and
you just take it out.

06:34.000 --> 06:34.958
Take it out.

06:38.708 --> 06:39.541

06:45.833 --> 06:47.708
I already got blown up
in the grenade scene.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.666
Just jump.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.000
He deserves a childhood.

06:51.041 --> 06:53.125
Everybody deserves a childhood.

06:53.166 --> 06:57.625
I'm not sure it's the childhood
they think they deserve.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.666
I think the
childhood that people

07:00.708 --> 07:03.833
deserve is the one where they
learn how the world works.

07:07.166 --> 07:09.125
I haven't always been
wise, or done what's right?

07:09.166 --> 07:11.625
Line.

07:11.666 --> 07:14.666
We all made mistakes.

07:14.708 --> 07:18.958
It's what we do after we make
the mistake that's important.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.541
I don't think we learn how
the world works at the movies.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.541

08:22.666 --> 08:24.708
Who the hell is
Steven Spielberg?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.541
You're kidding, right?

08:28.583 --> 08:31.375
Do I look like I'm kidding?

08:31.416 --> 08:35.708
The guy who made Jaws, the most
successful movie of all time?

08:35.750 --> 08:38.958
The movie we're making
a sequel to here?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.708
By make, do you
mean he produced it?

08:40.750 --> 08:41.958
No, directed it.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.958
Careful, you're bleeding
on Moonbase Alpha.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.333
OK, so tell me, Pat.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.291
What the hell's the
difference between a director

08:47.333 --> 08:48.291
and a producer?

08:48.333 --> 08:49.291
Well--

08:49.333 --> 08:50.208

08:52.208 --> 08:53.166
Patrick!

08:58.666 --> 09:00.208
I don't know where
you're hiding,

09:00.250 --> 09:02.291
but I'm going to
Jungle's in 15 minutes.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.458
And if you want me to
pick up any more film,

09:04.500 --> 09:07.791
you better clean up this
shark attack mess before I go.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.875
And don't forget, it's
your turn to do the runs.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.750
Producer, director.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.458
Anyway, in Steven Spielberg's
first movie, Duel,

09:19.500 --> 09:21.958
this guy's being chased by
this old diesel fuel truck.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.875
He cut off on the
highway, and this truck

09:23.916 --> 09:26.125
is, like, the unstoppable
ghost truck from hell.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.458
Truck that's been on the
highway since the beginning

09:28.500 --> 09:29.833
of time and always will be.

09:29.875 --> 09:31.458
And every time this
guy thinks he's

09:31.500 --> 09:32.833
gotten away from
the thing, wham,

09:32.875 --> 09:34.375
it's right there behind him.

09:34.416 --> 09:36.875
Or in the case of this one
shot, in front of him, waiting.

09:36.916 --> 09:39.125
And the way Steven
Spielberg shoots it,

09:39.166 --> 09:41.166
he doesn't just have a
dorky close up of the guy

09:41.208 --> 09:43.375
going, whoa, to his
POV of the truck

09:43.416 --> 09:45.625
on the road to another
shot of the guy reacting.

09:45.666 --> 09:46.791
Oh, of course not.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.291
No, Spielberg has
this car racing up

09:49.333 --> 09:51.125
the highway in a long shot.

09:51.166 --> 09:54.125
And suddenly, the car
slams on its brakes, wham,

09:54.166 --> 09:56.625
camera pulls back to
reveal the underside

09:56.666 --> 10:01.791
of this dark, oily, smelly,
rumbling, smoldering,

10:01.833 --> 10:04.625
mechanical monster
waiting for him.

10:04.666 --> 10:07.041
Could you get Hooper's torso?

10:07.083 --> 10:09.500
So the car hitting its
brakes is the reaction shot.

10:11.541 --> 10:14.291
The squeal of the car's tires
is the main character's scream

10:14.333 --> 10:15.416
of terror.

10:18.333 --> 10:20.333
I still don't get how you
think you can get away

10:20.375 --> 10:21.708
with making a Jaws 2.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.708
I mean, at the end of Jaws
1, the shark's nothing

10:23.750 --> 10:25.291
but red mist and bone meal.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.333
No, no, no, not if it's
like the truck in Duel.

10:27.375 --> 10:29.291
Not if it's a shark
that's been swimming

10:29.333 --> 10:32.000
in the ocean since the beginning
of time, and always will be,

10:32.041 --> 10:33.541
the primordial
carnivore instinct

10:33.583 --> 10:36.875
made manifest by its
insatiable desire to feed.

10:36.916 --> 10:40.666
What the hell are
you talking about?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.708
The pool filter will
get the rest out?

10:46.916 --> 10:49.458
And what happened the
other six films we started?

10:49.500 --> 10:51.125
We're a movie studio, Bill.

10:51.166 --> 10:53.791
If we're going to make it, we
need to work on as many movies

10:53.833 --> 10:54.958
as we can.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.875
Or maybe we could
just finish one.

10:56.916 --> 10:59.125
Requiem to the Planet of
the Apes is almost finished.

10:59.166 --> 11:00.625
Almost finished?

11:00.666 --> 11:02.833
You've been working on it
since you were 12 years old.

11:02.875 --> 11:04.500
Well, I want it to be perfect.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.791
Well shit, Pat, it's
already got a bunch

11:06.833 --> 11:08.875
of other 12-year-olds
running around a cornfield,

11:08.916 --> 11:10.875
and bad rubber monkey
mask chasing you

11:10.916 --> 11:13.875
in a loincloth pretending
to be Charlton Heston.

11:13.916 --> 11:15.625
What could be more
perfect than that?

11:15.666 --> 11:18.125
Are you ever going to start
taking this stuff seriously?

11:18.166 --> 11:19.458
- Hell no.
- Why not?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.541
Because I don't think
that making little super

11:21.583 --> 11:23.166
eight movies in Pat
Johnson's backyard

11:23.208 --> 11:24.458
is my ticket to Hollywood.

11:24.500 --> 11:26.291
Then why do you keep
showing up to help?

11:26.333 --> 11:27.875
Because I feel
sorry for you, Pat.

11:31.500 --> 11:32.458
Why?

11:32.500 --> 11:34.458
Oh, shit.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.125
What's that?

11:36.166 --> 11:37.208
That wasn't a shotgun.

11:37.250 --> 11:39.416
It was my stupid brother Pat.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.125
Patrick, when you
dragged your box spring

11:47.166 --> 11:49.625
mattress out into the woods
so your German snipers

11:49.666 --> 11:51.958
could fall out of the
trees without getting

11:52.000 --> 11:53.458
killed, what did I say?

11:53.500 --> 11:55.000
You said, Patrick--

11:55.041 --> 11:56.708
Electrons, please.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.833
When you spray painted
your sister's horse

11:58.875 --> 12:00.791
to look like a zebra,
what did I say?

12:00.833 --> 12:02.291
After that.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.666
You said that you would
always support whatever road

12:04.708 --> 12:07.458
I chose to follow, as long as
I was willing to pay the toll.

12:07.500 --> 12:08.875
And I always have been.

12:08.916 --> 12:10.875
I painted Jody's
horse brown again.

12:10.916 --> 12:12.458
You were 10.

12:12.500 --> 12:15.625
That was a noble gesture,
but you're not 10 anymore.

12:15.666 --> 12:18.000
And I'm not paying for
another pool filter.

12:18.041 --> 12:20.166
Mom, we don't need
a new pool filter.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.958
Why is it that every time
I blow the circuit breakers

12:23.000 --> 12:24.250
in this house, you panic?

12:24.291 --> 12:26.833
That's what circuit
breakers are, for blowing,

12:26.875 --> 12:29.458
to keep things from breaking
when you push them too far.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.625
That's exactly my point.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.166
You're pushing things too far.

12:32.208 --> 12:34.833
Mom, the shark attack had to
look like it was taking place

12:34.875 --> 12:36.125
out at sea, at night.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.458
We couldn't take the
shark out to Lake Michigan

12:38.500 --> 12:40.541
past the waves, or it'd
be too deep to operate.

12:40.583 --> 12:42.208
Plus, we had to shoot
it day for night,

12:42.250 --> 12:43.958
because I don't have
any decent lights,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.625
and we couldn't use
them on the water

12:45.666 --> 12:47.458
without electrocuting
Bill anyway.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.458
So the perfect solution was
to shoot it in an insert tank.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.208
It's a swimming pool.

The new school year got off to
a rousing start at the pep rally

14:00.333 --> 14:03.291
yesterday with over 100 members
of the Warren Township marching

14:03.333 --> 14:06.791
band all blowing and beating
their instruments in unison.

14:06.833 --> 14:08.125
Wrap it up, boys.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.291
OK, today's menu
is an old favorite.

14:10.333 --> 14:11.666
That's right.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.375
The cafeteria is
serving muttloaf,

14:13.416 --> 14:16.458
served with green-ish beans and
your choice of mashed potatoes

14:16.500 --> 14:17.625
or tater tits--

14:17.666 --> 14:19.041
I mean tots.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.375
Damn it, Holmes, you cannot
say tits in the morning

14:22.500 --> 14:23.666
Well, you just did.

14:26.375 --> 14:29.041
Besides, my tits
was the a typo tits.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.125
I'm pretty you meant to
write tots, not tits.

the varsity football team, led
by quarterback Doug Austerlin,

14:38.083 --> 14:39.833
trounced Stephenson yesterday.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.125
At the victory party,
Doug had this to say--

14:42.166 --> 14:44.541
oh man, I think
I'm going to hurl.

14:54.250 --> 14:56.666
Practicing our pick up
routine for parties.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.708
If one of us spots a
girl we want to meet,

14:58.750 --> 15:01.041
the other one picks a fight and
pretends to beat the crap out

of the guy that wants the girl.

Then, the girl
comes over and makes

stare at her like a puppy

26:26.041 --> 26:27.791
hearing a strange
noise, and then

26:27.833 --> 26:30.791
you smile this goofy smile.

26:30.833 --> 26:33.458
And if she smiles back, God
help her, you fall in love.

You ignored Debbie Froynt just
to call some guy

26:48.500 --> 26:49.458
on a Saturday night?

26:49.500 --> 26:50.958
You're gay, Pat.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.041
I'm not gay, and Douglas
Trumbull isn't just some guy.

26:54.083 --> 26:56.041
He's the guy who did
the special effects

26:56.083 --> 26:57.666
for "2001: A Space Odyssey."

26:57.708 --> 27:00.125
Oh, so you're gay for a guy

No, Bill, you don't
really hate it.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.291
You just don't understand it.

27:07.333 --> 27:09.833
No, I do really hate it,
and nobody understands it.

27:09.875 --> 27:11.333
I do.

27:11.375 --> 27:14.291
OK then, what the hell is
the ending supposed to mean?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.333
Guy flies a spaceship
into a hotel room,

27:16.375 --> 27:18.458
gets old, drops his
wine glass, and turns

27:18.500 --> 27:20.625
into a giant baby floating over
the Earth,

27:20.666 --> 27:22.125
what the hell is that?

27:22.166 --> 27:24.458
The hotel room was designed
by the alien intelligences

27:24.500 --> 27:26.000
observing Dave
Bowman to approximate

27:26.041 --> 27:27.125
his natural habitat.

27:27.166 --> 27:28.625
The aliens wanted
to know if Dave

27:28.666 --> 27:30.625
could try to figure out
how to take the next step

27:30.666 --> 27:31.541
in human evolution.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.791
But he can't.

27:32.833 --> 27:34.375
He doesn't know what
they want from him.

27:34.416 --> 27:35.791
Neither does the audience.

27:35.833 --> 27:38.125
Yeah, exactly, because Dave
represents the audience.

27:38.166 --> 27:39.875
And like the audience,
he's not ready to see

27:39.916 --> 27:41.458
beyond what he expects to see.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.666
So with each moment of
missed opportunity to evolve,

27:43.708 --> 27:45.458
he gets older, his
years passing before him

27:45.500 --> 27:47.041
in the blink of an eye.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.625
Or in this case, a changing of
a camera angle, till finally,

27:49.666 --> 27:51.833
maybe just as the
answer to the riddle

27:51.875 --> 27:53.291
is finally within
his grasp, he's

27:53.333 --> 27:55.541
too old to reach out
and touch the monolith

27:55.583 --> 27:57.458
and receive his final
gift of enlightenment.

27:57.500 --> 27:59.666
So the aliens send him back
to the evolutionary cradle

27:59.708 --> 28:00.791
to start all over again.

28:00.833 --> 28:02.375
No, they don't.

28:02.416 --> 28:05.166
They send him back as a giant
baby floating over the Earth.

28:05.208 --> 28:06.750
It's called symbolism, Bill.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.333
Pat.

28:13.375 --> 28:15.666
What the hell does a
giant baby floating

28:15.708 --> 28:17.291
over the Earth symbolize?

28:17.333 --> 28:19.625
Well, if you're Arthur C.
Clark, who wrote the book

28:19.666 --> 28:21.291
and is an eternal
optimist, then Dave

28:21.333 --> 28:23.458
was sent back as the star
child, the first born

28:23.500 --> 28:26.166
in a new breed of man who
might one day touch the stars.

28:26.208 --> 28:29.458
If you're Kubrick, who's such
a realist, he won't even fly,

28:29.500 --> 28:31.958
then Dave was simply sent
back as a cosmic mirror,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.458

ramp on his hands and knees.

stupid thing off?

36:46.208 --> 36:47.708

36:47.750 --> 36:48.666
Yeah, go ahead.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.833
We're done tonight.

36:50.875 --> 36:52.375
But we didn't get the shot.

36:52.416 --> 36:54.041
We're done.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.125
Good night.

36:55.166 --> 36:57.125

36:57.166 --> 36:59.666
You give me hope for mankind.

36:59.708 --> 37:02.041
Go to hell, Bill.

37:02.083 --> 37:06.125
So have you ever
seen one, a UFO?

37:06.166 --> 37:08.833
Well, when I was a kid, I
used to watch planes take off

37:08.875 --> 37:10.458
from Waukegan Airport.

37:10.500 --> 37:12.625
You could see them just
over those trees there.

37:12.666 --> 37:14.208
But you couldn't hear them.

37:14.250 --> 37:20.041
There were just these blazing
silent lights coming this way.

37:20.083 --> 37:25.041
And every time a plane took
off I thought, or wished,

37:25.083 --> 37:28.125
that it was a UFO
coming to take me back.

37:28.166 --> 37:30.041
Back?

37:30.083 --> 37:33.208
I thought that maybe
I was an alien.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.125
What could possibly
have changed your mind?

37:36.166 --> 37:39.958
Well, my dad said that
UFOs didn't exist.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.791
And to prove it, he drove
me down to the airport

37:43.833 --> 37:45.625
to watch a plane take off.

37:45.666 --> 37:46.833
Wow.

37:46.875 --> 37:50.083
Plus, the aliens
never did take me.

37:51.500 --> 37:55.625
So where do your alien
relatives come from?

37:55.666 --> 37:57.166
A distant star system.

37:57.208 --> 37:58.541
Yeah? What's it called?

37:58.583 --> 37:59.833
Hollywood.

38:02.041 --> 38:03.791
Sounds like you need
to go there then.

38:03.833 --> 38:06.166
Not without you.

38:08.416 --> 38:13.000
I never thought I'd find
anyone who understood me, who'd

38:13.041 --> 38:16.291
accept me for who I really am.

38:16.333 --> 38:21.458
And then there you were,
reading "2001: A Space Odyssey."

38:21.500 --> 38:25.541
And it was like, awoogah.

38:25.583 --> 38:28.791
That's the first thing
you noticed about me,

38:28.833 --> 38:30.125
that I was reading "2001?"

38:30.166 --> 38:31.125
Yeah.

38:31.166 --> 38:32.708
It was so weird.

38:32.750 --> 38:36.166
It was like we were
meant to find each other.

38:40.333 --> 38:42.125
What?

38:42.166 --> 38:44.625
Now, he was master of the world.

38:44.666 --> 38:46.791
And he was not quite
sure what to do next.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.291
But he would think of something.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.000
God, I love this book.

38:54.041 --> 38:55.166
Sorry.

38:59.000 --> 39:02.291
So then I figured, hey,
if I skim through this,

39:02.333 --> 39:04.500
maybe I'll finally
understand the movie.

39:08.166 --> 39:11.291
Well, it's really not that hard
to understand when you really

39:11.333 --> 39:12.666
think about it.

39:12.708 --> 39:14.416
Or if you stay awake.

39:17.541 --> 39:20.166

46:48.208 --> 46:50.833
He kept asking if
you got the shot.

46:52.666 --> 46:55.458
He wanted to make sure
that he'd done it right.

46:55.500 --> 46:57.458
He didn't want to waste film.

46:57.500 --> 46:58.875
I feel bad enough, OK?

47:02.833 --> 47:05.791
It isn't just about you.
It's about him too.

47:05.833 --> 47:07.333
He needs a man to
be around right now.

47:07.375 --> 47:08.375
Oh, and that's my fault?

47:08.416 --> 47:09.958
No, it's not.

47:10.000 --> 47:12.666
But that doesn't change the fact
that, with your father gone,

47:12.708 --> 47:14.375
you're the one they
all look up to.

47:14.416 --> 47:15.958
They count on you to
be there for them.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.458
Yeah, well maybe they shouldn't.

47:17.500 --> 47:19.166
Maybe I'm not ready
to be counted on.

47:19.208 --> 47:21.958
Well, maybe you shouldn't be
moving so fast with Linda then.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.125
Maybe you should mind
your own business.

47:24.166 --> 47:26.458
You are my own business.

47:26.500 --> 47:31.166
[gentle music]

47:42.541 --> 47:45.125
I think you should graduate
high school first and find out

47:45.166 --> 47:46.875
what it's like to live
in the real world.

47:46.916 --> 47:48.208
This isn't the real world.

47:48.250 --> 47:49.875
This is your parents' basement.

47:49.916 --> 47:51.958
I just think that, before
we move in together,

47:52.000 --> 47:53.500
you might want to
find a job that

47:53.541 --> 47:55.000
pays more than minimum wage.

47:55.041 --> 47:57.458
Yeah, but there aren't any
part time jobs in Lake County

47:57.500 --> 47:58.833
that pay more than minimum wage.

47:58.875 --> 48:00.166
That's why I got a second job.

48:00.208 --> 48:01.375
You what?

48:01.416 --> 48:04.125
Mom got me on the
late shift at Solo.

48:04.166 --> 48:05.666
Doing what?

48:05.708 --> 48:09.791
Injection molding cups in the
machine right next to hers.

48:09.833 --> 48:12.458
OK, well maybe your mom could
get me a job at the machine

48:12.500 --> 48:13.666
next to yours.

48:13.708 --> 48:16.333
Actually, that's
where Tony works.

48:18.666 --> 48:21.291
You know, there's an
opening at Weebolts

48:21.333 --> 48:24.625
managing the men's department.

48:24.666 --> 48:28.875
Well, I'm not real
comfortable in a tie.

48:28.916 --> 48:31.500
Were you comfortable in
my parents' basement?

48:40.708 --> 48:43.958
And that'll be it for
this Amazing Alfredo.

48:44.000 --> 48:47.166
But luckily, due to the miracle
of our patented identical

48:47.208 --> 48:49.125
costume technology,
you'll hardly

48:49.166 --> 48:51.458
even notice the difference,
as I turn things over

48:51.500 --> 48:54.000
to the Amazing Alfredo.

48:54.041 --> 48:56.125
[applause and laughter]

48:56.166 --> 48:57.291
OK, Rick's watching.

48:57.333 --> 48:58.375
Don't embarrass me.

48:58.416 --> 48:59.958
Do I ever?

49:00.000 --> 49:01.958
Oh, my God.

49:02.000 --> 49:02.875
Hi.

49:05.875 --> 49:11.041
Ladies and gentlemen, permit
me to introduce myself.

49:11.083 --> 49:12.000
I am--

49:15.583 --> 49:17.291
[thunder]

49:17.333 --> 49:18.458
I am--

49:18.500 --> 49:19.458
[thunder strike]

49:19.500 --> 49:23.208
[screaming]

49:26.708 --> 49:28.958
Now he was master of the world.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.458
[screaming]

49:30.500 --> 49:33.041
And he was not quite
sure what to do next,

49:33.083 --> 49:34.666
but he would think of something.

49:34.708 --> 49:38.583
[music playing]

49:57.708 --> 50:06.000
I am the Amazingly Wet Alfredo.

50:06.041 --> 50:09.208
So, I'll guess your
age, your weight.

50:09.250 --> 50:10.875
Guess who I'm in love with?

50:12.500 --> 50:13.791
What on earth?

50:13.833 --> 50:15.291
Janet Johnson,
Stoneridge Heritage.

50:15.333 --> 50:16.958
I got the job.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.666
We're going to Gauge's Lake with
Bill and Robin to celebrate.

50:19.708 --> 50:21.791
Have I got a dog for you.

50:21.833 --> 50:23.166
He's had all his shots.

50:23.208 --> 50:25.291
He's completely house
trained, very well behaved.

50:25.333 --> 50:27.708
He needs a haircut, but we
do grooming here as well.

50:27.750 --> 50:29.958
But seriously, he's been
making these little movies

50:30.000 --> 50:31.500
since he was 9.

50:31.541 --> 50:33.875
You know, with the home movie
camera his dad left behind.

50:33.916 --> 50:35.125
But they're really something.

50:35.166 --> 50:36.791
He did this one which is like

50:36.833 --> 50:38.458
those "Planet of the Apes"
movies.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.833
And he and his friends
stuck straws up their noses

50:40.875 --> 50:43.666
so they could breathe, and put
plaster all over their faces,

50:43.708 --> 50:45.791
and made molds, and sculpted
ape faces, and made masks

50:45.833 --> 50:46.958
out of liquid latex.

50:47.000 --> 50:48.208
And then they went out

50:48.250 --> 50:49.875
and put together sets
and little models,

50:49.916 --> 50:51.458
and shot the whole thing
themselves.

50:51.500 --> 50:53.125
And it's really good.

50:53.166 --> 50:55.791
And they showed it at all the
grade schools around the area.

50:55.833 --> 50:57.791
And he was even in
the local paper.

50:57.833 --> 51:00.833
But now all he thinks about
is getting out to California

51:00.875 --> 51:02.958
and meeting those
movie heroes of his,

51:03.000 --> 51:05.458
like what's his name, the
guy that did all the trick

51:05.500 --> 51:07.291
photography on "2001."

51:07.333 --> 51:09.458
Special effects.

51:09.500 --> 51:12.125
Yes, that's right,
Douglas Trumbull.

51:12.166 --> 51:15.291
But here we are, in Wadsworth,
Illinois, and I just--

51:15.333 --> 51:16.875
I don't know how to help him.

51:16.916 --> 51:19.375
And I certainly don't
know anybody in Hollywood.

51:19.416 --> 51:21.208
So here's what I was wondering.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.625
If I could save enough
money and get him out there,

51:23.666 --> 51:25.625
do you think maybe
you could talk to him,

51:25.666 --> 51:27.875
and give him some pointers,
and maybe introduce him

51:27.916 --> 51:29.291
to this Douglas Trumbull person?

51:29.333 --> 51:30.875
[music playing]

51:36.583 --> 51:37.875
You're kidding.

51:37.916 --> 51:38.958
Of course.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.458
I know there are no guarantees.

51:40.500 --> 51:42.125
There never are.

51:42.166 --> 51:44.166
OK, wonderful.

51:44.208 --> 51:46.791
I'll get him out on
a plane this weekend.

51:46.833 --> 51:49.000
Thank you so much, Herb.

51:49.041 --> 51:50.375
Thank you so much.

51:50.416 --> 51:51.375
Bye.

51:55.750 --> 52:02.791
[SINGING] Hooray for Hollywood.

52:02.833 --> 52:05.708
I got you all set
up in Hollywood.

52:05.750 --> 52:08.500
I called a guy I
never met there.

52:08.541 --> 52:13.125
Now let's cut your hair and
find you something to wear.

52:13.166 --> 52:15.541
[SINGING] Who will
pay the airfare?

52:19.833 --> 52:25.333
[SINGING] Hooray
for credit cards.

52:25.375 --> 52:29.125
La, la, la, la, la,
la, la credit cards.

52:29.166 --> 52:31.500
[vocalizing]

52:37.166 --> 52:41.750
[atmospheric music]

53:42.208 --> 53:46.000
[heavy breathing]

53:57.541 --> 54:01.500
[phone ringing]

54:34.500 --> 54:35.750
Can I help you?

54:37.916 --> 54:39.666
I'm Pat Johnson.

54:41.166 --> 54:42.541
Hi.

54:42.583 --> 54:45.125
I'm Herb Lightman.

54:45.166 --> 54:48.791
Welcome to Hollywood.

54:48.833 --> 54:50.875
Thank you. Thank you.

54:50.916 --> 54:55.166
Oh, I'm also Malcolm
Higgins, and Steven Blum,

54:55.208 --> 55:00.625
and Ari Roscoe,
and Colin Anderson,

55:00.666 --> 55:07.458
and Felipe Castero Junior.

55:07.500 --> 55:09.541
You write the whole magazine?

55:09.583 --> 55:12.500
When I'm not entertaining
the folks from out of town.

55:13.916 --> 55:15.291
[phone ringing]

55:15.333 --> 55:17.250
And answering the telephone.

55:29.500 --> 55:33.291
So-- so, how does one get to
be the editor of "American

55:33.333 --> 55:36.458
Cinematographer Magazine?"

55:36.500 --> 55:39.833
One sets out to become a
big Hollywood director.

55:44.666 --> 55:51.125
Again, I just want to thank you
so much for doing this for me.

55:51.166 --> 55:55.000
Thanks a lot.

55:55.041 --> 55:59.041
I take it that thanking people
a lot in advance of their

55:59.083 --> 56:03.666
having done anything for you
is a Johnson family trait.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.166
Herb Lightman.

56:08.208 --> 56:09.208
[chatter]

56:09.250 --> 56:10.708
Oh, hello.

56:10.750 --> 56:12.541
Again.

56:12.583 --> 56:15.625
Yeah, he's here, hair and all.

56:15.666 --> 56:17.291
No, no, I'm kidding,
I'm kidding.

56:17.333 --> 56:19.333
No, it's fine.

56:19.375 --> 56:21.875
No, a haircut
won't be necessary.

56:21.916 --> 56:25.125
The Incredible Hulk look
is all the rage these days.

56:25.166 --> 56:26.625
Is he what?

56:26.666 --> 56:30.500
Yes, he's still wearing his tie.

56:30.541 --> 56:33.458
Oh, no, no, no, no,
really, that won't-- no,

56:33.500 --> 56:35.208
that won't be necessary.

56:35.250 --> 56:39.458
My thanks is the look
in a young person's eyes

56:39.500 --> 56:41.791
when I help make
their dream come true.

56:41.833 --> 56:43.625
No really.

56:43.666 --> 56:45.958
I'm happy to help.

56:46.000 --> 56:48.291
What's that?

56:48.333 --> 56:49.833
Of course.

56:49.875 --> 56:51.791
I will.

56:51.833 --> 56:53.458
I will.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.375
Yeah.

56:55.416 --> 56:58.291
OK, you got it.

56:58.333 --> 57:00.291
I can do that.

57:00.333 --> 57:03.125
As soon as I get off the phone.

57:03.166 --> 57:06.375
OK, bye.

57:06.416 --> 57:09.958
You will never guess
who just called.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.125
Yeah.

57:11.166 --> 57:12.583
Sorry, she's--

57:12.625 --> 57:20.208
She asked me to remind you
to thank me for doing this.

57:20.250 --> 57:22.625
Thank you.

57:22.666 --> 57:24.208
Oh, sorry, right, right.

57:24.250 --> 57:27.125
Your thanks is the look
in a young person's eyes

57:27.166 --> 57:29.541
when you help make
their dreams come true.

57:29.583 --> 57:30.625
That's right.

57:30.666 --> 57:32.458
And you know how
many times I've had

57:32.500 --> 57:34.833
the pleasure of seeing that
look in a young person's eye

57:34.875 --> 57:35.958
when their dream comes true?

57:36.000 --> 57:37.000
Precisely never.

57:37.041 --> 57:38.458
Why?

57:38.500 --> 57:40.333
Because I've never done
this for anyone before.

57:40.375 --> 57:41.958
Why?

57:42.000 --> 57:44.500
Because I never wanted to see
the look in a young person's

57:44.541 --> 57:46.958
eyes when they realize that
their dream is probably not

57:47.000 --> 57:47.875
going to come true.

57:47.916 --> 57:49.500
Why?

57:49.541 --> 57:52.291
Because Hollywood is the least
conducive place on the planet

57:52.333 --> 57:54.500
Earth for anyone's
dream to ever come true.

57:57.375 --> 57:59.208
So why are you
doing this for me?

58:00.666 --> 58:07.125
Cause your mother has
huge, clanging steel balls.

58:07.166 --> 58:10.041
Because you're here
anyway and because you say

58:10.083 --> 58:12.458
thank you a lot.

58:12.500 --> 58:15.375
[phone ringing]

58:15.416 --> 58:17.333
Shall we go?

58:20.833 --> 58:22.166
So tell me something.

58:22.208 --> 58:23.791
Of all the people
in Hollywood you

58:23.833 --> 58:26.125
could pick to meet,
why Douglas Trumbull?

58:26.166 --> 58:28.875
Have you ever seen
"2001: A Space Odyssey?"

58:28.916 --> 58:32.125
Well, it took a while to
finally get to Los Angeles,

58:32.166 --> 58:33.458
but yes, I've seen it.

58:33.500 --> 58:34.958
Did you understand the ending?

58:35.000 --> 58:36.291
Of course.

58:36.333 --> 58:38.833
Did you?

58:38.875 --> 58:40.625
Let me guess, you're
a hand grenade,

58:40.666 --> 58:43.166
and I just pulled the pin.

58:43.208 --> 58:44.958
The riddle is nearly
within his grasp,

58:45.000 --> 58:47.291
but he's too old to reach
out and touch the monolith

58:47.333 --> 58:49.125
and receive his final
gift of enlightenment.

58:49.166 --> 58:52.166
So they send him back to
the evolutionary cradle

58:52.208 --> 58:55.750
to start all over again.

58:56.916 --> 58:58.166
Kaboom.

59:02.416 --> 59:05.791
Well, I'm Herb Lightman,
if you could call him.

59:05.833 --> 59:06.875
No worries.

59:06.916 --> 59:08.208
Good.

59:08.250 --> 59:09.458
OK. I'll do that.

59:09.500 --> 59:11.125
Sure.

59:11.166 --> 59:14.500
Well, the good news is--

59:14.541 --> 59:16.708
You can go in now.

59:16.750 --> 59:18.291
Thank you.

59:18.333 --> 59:19.625
What's the bad news?

59:19.666 --> 59:21.875
The bad news is that
Douglas isn't here today.

59:24.041 --> 59:25.625
Did you tell them I was coming?

59:25.666 --> 59:28.791
I told him I was coming.

59:28.833 --> 59:32.958
Well, I mean, there's still
probably a bunch of cool stuff

59:33.000 --> 59:34.666
to see, right?

59:34.708 --> 59:37.000
I could leave him a note.

59:37.041 --> 59:39.666
I have some pictures
of my models.

59:39.708 --> 59:42.458
I could leave him my
movie and my projector.

59:42.500 --> 59:45.791
I mean, it's worth a try, right?

59:45.833 --> 59:47.750
You're asking the wrong guy.

59:50.416 --> 59:51.666
It's worth a try.

59:55.041 --> 59:57.541
OK, we have cumulocity.

59:57.583 --> 59:58.958
Roll camera.

59:59.000 --> 1:00:02.750
[music playing]

1:00:19.916 --> 1:00:22.416
Give us a little more
speed on the color changes.

1:00:26.041 --> 1:00:27.708
Yeah, that's it, that's it.

1:00:30.333 --> 1:00:35.041
Just-- OK, just
pull back slowly.

1:00:35.083 --> 1:00:37.833
Starting further back and
push through the cloud.

1:00:41.041 --> 1:00:43.041
So what is this
movie called anyway?

1:00:43.083 --> 1:00:45.291
It's called "Close Encounters
of the Third Kind."

1:00:45.333 --> 1:00:46.958
What does that mean?

1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:48.625
Contact.

1:00:48.666 --> 1:00:52.833
Close encounter of the
first kind is a sighting.

1:00:52.875 --> 1:00:54.875
Close encounter
of the second kind

1:00:54.916 --> 1:00:57.791
is physical evidence
of an encounter.

1:00:57.833 --> 1:00:59.708
Close encounter
of the third kind

1:00:59.750 --> 1:01:02.791
is actual contact
with the aliens.

1:01:02.833 --> 1:01:06.375
It's "True UFO Stories
Magazine," April 1974.

1:01:06.416 --> 1:01:07.458
Don't swing.

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:08.625
You want a Pepsi?

1:01:08.666 --> 1:01:10.291
Sorry, wait, stop.

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:11.291
Are you serious?

1:01:11.333 --> 1:01:12.500
Yeah, thank you.

1:01:12.541 --> 1:01:13.833
Oh, you messed up the cloud.

1:01:13.875 --> 1:01:15.166
It messed up the cloud.

1:01:15.208 --> 1:01:17.041
Cut.

1:01:17.083 --> 1:01:18.958
How long to reset?

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:20.500
25 minutes.

1:01:21.833 --> 1:01:23.500
Are you the--

1:01:23.541 --> 1:01:25.291
I really think it's four hours.

1:01:25.333 --> 1:01:27.166
You're Steven Spielberg.

1:01:27.208 --> 1:01:28.625
Steven.

1:01:28.666 --> 1:01:29.625
Hey, Herb.

1:01:29.666 --> 1:01:30.791
Come on.

1:01:30.833 --> 1:01:32.958
Let me show you guys around.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:34.333
How old is he?

1:01:34.375 --> 1:01:35.875
11.

1:01:35.916 --> 1:01:38.500
OK, let's recycle the tank
and order some dinner.

1:01:40.666 --> 1:01:42.500
When I was a kid, I used
to watch planes take off

1:01:42.541 --> 1:01:43.625
from the local airport.

1:01:43.666 --> 1:01:44.791
To me, they weren't airplanes,

1:01:44.833 --> 1:01:45.708
they were spaceships--

1:01:45.750 --> 1:01:46.833
Doug.

1:01:46.875 --> 1:01:48.208
--growing up on all
those '50s films

1:01:48.250 --> 1:01:49.375
with flying saucers
and aliens coming

1:01:49.416 --> 1:01:50.291
to Earth to destroy mankind.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:51.375
Where is Doug?

1:01:51.416 --> 1:01:52.875
Did you tell him I was coming?

1:01:52.916 --> 1:01:54.666
Which explains why my first film
was a little epic

1:01:54.708 --> 1:01:55.625
called "Firelight--"

1:01:55.666 --> 1:01:56.791
Doug.

1:01:56.833 --> 1:01:58.125
--which was essentially
about aliens

1:01:58.166 --> 1:01:59.791
coming to my backyard
and destroying my sisters.

1:01:59.833 --> 1:02:01.166
Where's Doug?

1:02:01.208 --> 1:02:02.958
So obviously, you've
come a long way

1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.958
from making little Super
8 movies in the backyard.

1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.875
Yeah, now I make big Super
8 movies in the back lot.

1:02:08.916 --> 1:02:13.291
Still, knowing what you know
now about how difficult it

1:02:13.333 --> 1:02:17.333
is to really do
this, I wonder what

1:02:17.375 --> 1:02:20.833
you would say to the 17-year-old
kid in the backyard who thinks

1:02:20.875 --> 1:02:25.625
he's got it all figured out.

1:02:25.666 --> 1:02:27.625
I say, if you're so
smart, what are you

1:02:27.666 --> 1:02:29.791
still doing in your backyard?

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:31.958
But if the kid were
to get up the courage

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.291
to leave the backyard and show
up on your doorstep

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:35.416
looking for help?

1:02:35.458 --> 1:02:37.125
I'd say, get your
own Douglas Trumbull,

1:02:37.166 --> 1:02:38.458
if you could find him.

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:40.625
Speaking of which, could
we talk for just a bit

1:02:40.666 --> 1:02:42.291
about exactly what
Douglas and his team

1:02:42.333 --> 1:02:43.625
are doing for you here?

1:02:43.666 --> 1:02:45.666
I knew I wanted to show
flying saucers in a way

1:02:45.708 --> 1:02:47.958
that they'd never been shown
before, and I had to go--

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:50.000
Well, "Close Encounters"
is a very effects heavy film.

1:02:50.041 --> 1:02:51.041
--a real alien.

1:02:51.083 --> 1:02:52.625
His name is Douglas Trumbull.

1:02:52.666 --> 1:02:54.791
He worked on a little film
called "2001: A Space Odyssey."

1:02:54.833 --> 1:02:56.791
Rejecting the sketches, we
created force perspective

1:02:56.833 --> 1:02:58.625
planning so much Greg,
Gene, and his model crew

1:02:58.666 --> 1:03:00.375
made miniature landscapes
with an amazing sense

1:03:00.416 --> 1:03:01.791
of distance and very
little space.

1:03:01.833 --> 1:03:03.666
Before it was paintings based
on sketches, and then

1:03:03.708 --> 1:03:05.291
Doug, Vilmos and I
work out the color scheme.

1:03:05.333 --> 1:03:06.333
Who is Vilmos?

1:03:08.041 --> 1:03:10.958
The DP.

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:15.291
The director of photography.

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:16.333
I know.

1:03:16.375 --> 1:03:17.458
OK.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:19.041
My worry was that
the stars would

1:03:19.083 --> 1:03:21.791
become diffused blobs instead
of crisp little points of light.

1:03:21.833 --> 1:03:23.458
So Richard Yuricich
came with the idea

1:03:23.500 --> 1:03:24.958
of burning the
starfields directly

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.166
in the interpositive, which
meant doing a latent image

1:03:27.208 --> 1:03:28.791
pass through the
optical printer,

1:03:28.833 --> 1:03:31.291
and bypacking the starfield
element with the original--

1:03:31.333 --> 1:03:33.750
[atmospheric music]

1:03:37.500 --> 1:03:40.125
--projection that will allow
us to put these large format

1:03:40.166 --> 1:03:42.958
images on the Scotchlite screen,
reflected back exactly on axis

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.500
so that any foreground object
will block its own shadow,

1:03:45.541 --> 1:03:47.708
preventing a perfect comp
with no need for blue screen

1:03:47.750 --> 1:03:48.833
or motion control.

1:03:48.875 --> 1:03:50.000
What?

1:03:50.041 --> 1:03:52.125
Sorry, what's motion control?

1:03:52.166 --> 1:03:55.041
[music playing]

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:03.791
So I told the guys at the studio
that I needed five airplanes,

1:04:03.833 --> 1:04:05.458
and they tried to give me three.

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:08.166
I told them, you can't make a
circle with three airplanes.

1:04:08.208 --> 1:04:09.791
You can make a
triangle with three.

1:04:09.833 --> 1:04:11.333
You can make a square with four.

1:04:11.375 --> 1:04:13.041
But if you're going
to make a circle,

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.958
you're going to need at
least five airplanes.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.500
[gentle music]

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:56.416
You're Greg Jein.

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.875
You built the Dark Star, and the
penis ship in "Flesh Gordon."

1:05:03.916 --> 1:05:05.750
[laughter]

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:09.375
"Star Log Magazine."

1:05:09.416 --> 1:05:11.666
Security.

1:05:11.708 --> 1:05:13.666
Relax.

1:05:13.708 --> 1:05:17.291
We don't really have
security, obviously.

1:05:17.333 --> 1:05:20.875
That's-- you got me.

1:05:20.916 --> 1:05:22.833
Looking for Doug?

1:05:22.875 --> 1:05:24.166
Yeah, how did you know?

1:05:24.208 --> 1:05:25.541
Everybody's looking for--

1:05:25.583 --> 1:05:27.833
Because you had an audience
with Steven Spielberg,

1:05:27.875 --> 1:05:29.500
and you ended up
in his model shop.

1:05:33.833 --> 1:05:35.208
I got lost.

1:05:35.250 --> 1:05:37.958
I know you did.

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.125
So here you are at
the intersection

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:44.208
of fantasy and reality, just
as far from Douglas Trumbull

1:05:44.250 --> 1:05:50.541
as you were back in Wadsworth,
Illinois, population 750.

1:05:50.583 --> 1:05:54.250
[engine revving]

1:06:03.333 --> 1:06:06.458
[typewriter keys clicking]

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:10.166
[atmospheric music]

1:06:27.583 --> 1:06:29.000
Hey, Doug!

1:06:29.041 --> 1:06:30.291
Doug!

1:06:30.333 --> 1:06:33.208
Hey, hey, hey, Doug.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:34.625
Hey, Herb.

1:06:34.666 --> 1:06:36.500
Sorry, about 12
million things came up.

1:06:36.541 --> 1:06:37.958
We can do the
interview another time.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:38.958
It's not important.

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:40.333
Anyway, I just want
to tell you

1:06:40.375 --> 1:06:41.708
I brought
somebody along today

1:06:41.750 --> 1:06:43.375
who has been anxious to meet you

1:06:43.416 --> 1:06:45.458
since he saw "2001" when
he was eight years old.

1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:47.166
And he understood it, no less.

1:06:47.208 --> 1:06:49.166
But anyway, he's a
film director himself,

1:06:49.208 --> 1:06:52.291
and that's because he was
so turned on and so inspired

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:53.958
by your first film.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.250
So if you could have half
a second, just say hi.

1:07:01.666 --> 1:07:03.000
Hi.

1:07:09.166 --> 1:07:10.500
Nice meeting you.

1:07:15.041 --> 1:07:17.875
[typewriter keys clicking]

1:07:19.208 --> 1:07:23.083
What-- what, you, you
had nothing to say?

1:07:25.541 --> 1:07:28.333
Well, that's so sweet.

1:07:28.375 --> 1:07:29.375
So--

1:07:29.416 --> 1:07:31.375
Stupid!

1:07:31.416 --> 1:07:33.291
I can't believe you said that!

1:07:33.333 --> 1:07:34.333
Said what?

1:07:34.375 --> 1:07:35.625
Nothing!

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:37.791
It was a good start.

1:07:37.833 --> 1:07:41.291
"Hi, my name is" might
have been a good follow up.

1:07:41.333 --> 1:07:43.125
Oh, boy.

1:07:43.166 --> 1:07:46.041
Saying goodbye to Steven might
have been a good idea too.

1:07:46.083 --> 1:07:49.916
[music playing]

1:07:52.416 --> 1:07:53.958
And that's it?

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.791
After all this crazy hoping,
and trying, and dreaming?

1:07:57.833 --> 1:08:01.291
You're nearly killing me making
dumb movies in your backyard.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:06.541
That's all you got from your
one chance at Hollywood?

1:08:06.583 --> 1:08:11.875
Well, there is one other
little, little thing.

1:08:17.375 --> 1:08:18.500
Hi, guys, John Dagster.

1:08:18.541 --> 1:08:20.208
Welcome to Industrial
Light and Magic.

1:08:20.250 --> 1:08:21.958
As you can see from
the poster, we're

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000
a little behind schedule,
which means we're all

1:08:24.041 --> 1:08:25.458
a little over-caffeinated here.

1:08:25.500 --> 1:08:26.833
So please keep
your hands and feet

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:28.000
inside the ride at all times.

1:08:28.041 --> 1:08:29.125
No flash photography.

1:08:29.166 --> 1:08:30.958
Most importantly,
remember to forget

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.500
every single thing you see
here, except for the cool stuff.

1:08:33.541 --> 1:08:35.541
The surface of the Death
Star, a small artificial moon

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:37.208
that goes around blowing
up other planets.

1:08:37.250 --> 1:08:38.625
So we had to make a lot of it.

1:08:38.666 --> 1:08:40.541
So we made wood patterns
and took molds off them

1:08:40.583 --> 1:08:42.625
with this Dow Corning
Silastic liquid rubber,

1:08:42.666 --> 1:08:44.875
which is normally used to seal
basements against flooding,

1:08:44.916 --> 1:08:46.708
inject the molds with
expandable urethane foam,

1:08:46.750 --> 1:08:48.125
like the stuff they squirt
in the walls

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:49.041
for insulation.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:50.208
Wham-o.

1:08:50.250 --> 1:08:51.875
Repeatable lightweight
modular sections.

1:08:51.916 --> 1:08:53.958
They're really easy
to throw around.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:56.791
Those are x-wings, part of
a small fleet of battleships

1:08:56.833 --> 1:08:59.958
used by the Rebel Alliance
to fight the Empire.

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:03.291
There's the escape
capsules, right over here.

1:09:03.333 --> 1:09:06.208
And over here, we've got the--

1:09:06.250 --> 1:09:08.958
we've got the Millennium Falcon.

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.958
It belongs to a space
pirate named Han Solo

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.958
and his Wookie, Chewbacca.

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.166
That's the rebel blockade
runner, right here.

1:09:16.208 --> 1:09:17.625
And where are we?

1:09:17.666 --> 1:09:20.291
Over here, we've got
the Star Destroyer.

1:09:20.333 --> 1:09:24.500
And here is Luke's Land Speeder.

1:09:24.541 --> 1:09:27.125
Now, that's Luke,
destroyed C-3PO,

1:09:27.166 --> 1:09:28.541
and that's Obi-Wan Kenobi.

1:09:28.583 --> 1:09:30.458
Wait, that's the Bionic
Man action figure.

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:31.875
Yeah, don't--
don't tell anybody.

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:33.708
We're making this whole
movie out of things

1:09:33.750 --> 1:09:35.500
you could find
lying around your garage.

1:09:35.541 --> 1:09:36.666
That's so cool.

1:09:36.708 --> 1:09:38.500
Over here, we have
our breakaway models.

1:09:38.541 --> 1:09:39.875
They're made from
a brittle resin

1:09:39.916 --> 1:09:41.125
which explodes really nicely.

1:09:41.166 --> 1:09:42.125
Go ahead, break it.

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:43.125
No, no, no, no, no.

1:09:43.166 --> 1:09:44.333
Here, check it out.

1:09:44.375 --> 1:09:47.291
No, no, no, no,
what are you doing?

1:09:47.333 --> 1:09:48.958
Cool, huh?

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.500
I can fix this.

1:09:50.541 --> 1:09:53.458
Now, understand a lot
of the blue screens

1:09:53.500 --> 1:09:54.791
still aren't composited.

1:09:54.833 --> 1:09:56.666
There's no music or
sound effects yet.

1:09:56.708 --> 1:09:59.500
It's still got a British from
"World War II," and stuff

1:09:59.541 --> 1:10:01.333
from "Dam Busters"
and "633 Squadron"

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:05.041
standing in for the
dogfight scenes.

1:10:05.083 --> 1:10:09.041
And this is our screening room.

1:10:09.083 --> 1:10:12.416
[dramatic music]

1:10:49.833 --> 1:10:51.291
Everyone's fixed up.

1:10:51.333 --> 1:10:54.000
And then, and suddenly,
they all turn around,

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:56.958
and this huge crowd of
hundreds of Rebel pilots

1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:58.458
give him a standing ovation.

1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:00.125
And that's it.

1:11:00.166 --> 1:11:03.291
That's the end.

1:11:03.333 --> 1:11:04.875
OK.

1:11:04.916 --> 1:11:08.333
So I just have one--
one question for you.

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:09.666
Go ahead.

1:11:09.708 --> 1:11:11.125
What the hell were
those hundreds

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:13.291
of other Rebel pilots
doing while their pals were

1:11:13.333 --> 1:11:15.458
getting their asses kicked
attacking the Death Star?

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.458
I don't know.

1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:17.708
Who cares?

1:11:17.750 --> 1:11:19.708
I'm telling you, when
this movie comes out,

1:11:19.750 --> 1:11:21.833
it's going to be like Woodstock.

1:11:21.875 --> 1:11:23.000
I'm thinking Nerdstock.

1:11:26.833 --> 1:11:30.541
When and where does
this thing come out?

1:11:30.583 --> 1:11:35.666
May 25th at theaters everywhere!

1:11:35.708 --> 1:11:38.125
You really met Steven Spielberg?

1:11:38.166 --> 1:11:40.291
Yeah, I really did.

1:11:40.333 --> 1:11:42.458
Did you show him your
"Planet of the Apes" movie?

1:11:42.500 --> 1:11:43.625
No.

1:11:43.666 --> 1:11:44.833
Good.

1:11:44.875 --> 1:11:46.458
Oh, man we have to
go opening night.

1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:47.375
We have to.

1:11:47.416 --> 1:11:48.333
Why?

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:54.541
Go see this movie again
when it comes out.

1:11:54.583 --> 1:11:56.458
See it opening day, first show.

1:11:56.500 --> 1:11:58.541
If it doesn't make
you jump in your car

1:11:58.583 --> 1:12:01.000
and drive like hell to get
back out here, then maybe

1:12:01.041 --> 1:12:03.500
I'm wrong about you.

1:12:03.541 --> 1:12:05.041
But I don't think I am.

1:12:08.041 --> 1:12:09.625
Um, hi.

1:12:09.666 --> 1:12:12.250
Pat Johnson says your center
speaker's distorting again.

1:12:15.166 --> 1:12:16.083
OK, bye.

1:12:18.666 --> 1:12:19.666
Come on, do it.

1:12:19.708 --> 1:12:20.708
No, I'm eating popcorn.

1:12:20.750 --> 1:12:22.333
The butter ought
to make it easier.

1:12:22.375 --> 1:12:23.833
What are you guys talking about?

1:12:23.875 --> 1:12:25.875
Robin can stick her
entire fist in her mouth.

1:12:25.916 --> 1:12:27.291
Don't ask her to
prove it, though,

1:12:27.333 --> 1:12:28.625
even with something smaller.

1:12:28.666 --> 1:12:30.291
I could put my entire
fist in your mouth.

1:12:30.333 --> 1:12:31.708
Well, now we're
starting something.

1:12:31.750 --> 1:12:32.791
OK, OK. Shh.

1:12:32.833 --> 1:12:34.125
Please refrain from talking--

1:12:34.166 --> 1:12:35.791
Pat, there's no one
else in the theater.

1:12:35.833 --> 1:12:36.666
This might be it, Bill.

1:12:36.708 --> 1:12:37.791
What?

1:12:37.833 --> 1:12:39.208
You say that every time.

1:12:39.250 --> 1:12:42.000
And every time, we end up
staring in awe struck wonder

1:12:42.041 --> 1:12:44.208
at the coming attractions to
"Logan's Run," or "Breaker

1:12:44.250 --> 1:12:47.458
Breaker" starring Chuck Norris.

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:48.625
I like Chuck Norris.

1:12:48.666 --> 1:12:50.250
[music playing]

1:12:50.291 --> 1:12:53.708
And really, Pat, if this "Space
Wars" thing is so great, then

1:12:53.750 --> 1:12:57.041
why hasn't there been
any hoopla about it?

1:12:57.083 --> 1:12:58.625
- It's "Star Wars."
- Hoopla?

1:12:58.666 --> 1:12:59.791
Know what I think?

1:12:59.833 --> 1:13:01.166
You're making this
"Space Wars" thing up.

1:13:01.208 --> 1:13:02.625
It's "Star Wars," and
why would I?

1:13:02.666 --> 1:13:04.500
So you had something to
tell people about your trip

1:13:04.541 --> 1:13:05.833
to Hollywood other
than, I blew it.

1:13:05.875 --> 1:13:07.083
I didn't blow it, Bill.

1:13:07.125 --> 1:13:08.666
You met Steven Spielberg
and Douglas Trumbull,

1:13:08.708 --> 1:13:09.791
and you came back.

1:13:09.833 --> 1:13:11.291
Why come back
if you didn't blow it?

1:13:11.333 --> 1:13:12.500
Are you serious?

1:13:12.541 --> 1:13:13.791
You're having one
of your fake fights.

1:13:13.833 --> 1:13:14.958
You're wasting your time.

1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:16.000
Why did I come back?

1:13:16.041 --> 1:13:17.166
I came back
to finish high school.

1:13:17.208 --> 1:13:18.208
The guy who directed "Jaws."

1:13:18.250 --> 1:13:19.291
You're acting
like you knew that?

1:13:19.333 --> 1:13:20.625
I told you that.

1:13:20.666 --> 1:13:21.958
I'm too busy watching
the coming attractions

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.291
to "Space Wars."

1:13:23.333 --> 1:13:24.458
It's "Star--" what?

1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:30.625
[explosions]

1:13:30.666 --> 1:13:31.666
He's moving too fast!

1:13:31.708 --> 1:13:32.958
It's an epic of heroes--

1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.500
[explosions]

1:13:35.541 --> 1:13:41.791
--villains, aliens
from 1,000 worlds.

1:13:41.833 --> 1:13:44.333
[grunting]

1:13:44.375 --> 1:13:45.958
[lightsaber igniting]

1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:50.208
"Star Wars," a billion years
in the making, and it's

1:13:50.250 --> 1:13:52.958
coming to your
galaxy this summer.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:57.000
[explosion]

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.375
Oh, my god.

1:14:00.416 --> 1:14:01.958
What do you mean, "Oh, my god?"

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.791
That was the goofiest
thing I've ever seen.

1:14:03.833 --> 1:14:05.125
May 25th?

1:14:05.166 --> 1:14:07.125
That's like a month from now.

1:14:07.166 --> 1:14:08.458
I know.

1:14:08.500 --> 1:14:10.666
No, Pat, you don't.

1:14:14.833 --> 1:14:17.291
[upbeat music]

1:14:17.333 --> 1:14:21.000
[vocalizing]

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:26.958
I have you now.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.625
[vocalizing]

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:30.291
Oh, right, like I'd waste
my time on

1:14:30.333 --> 1:14:31.458
some dorky sci-fi movie.

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:32.583
Oh, so you don't have

1:14:32.625 --> 1:14:34.291
your little "Star Trek"
parties anymore?

1:14:34.333 --> 1:14:35.625
Shut up.

1:14:35.666 --> 1:14:37.625
You probably shouldn't
see "Star Wars" anyway.

1:14:37.666 --> 1:14:38.791
Oh, why is that?

1:14:38.833 --> 1:14:40.458
Well, there's this
thing in it called

1:14:40.500 --> 1:14:42.041
the Death Star,
which could take out

1:14:42.083 --> 1:14:43.541
the Enterprise with one shot.

1:14:45.833 --> 1:14:47.625
The Enterprise has
deflector shields.

1:14:47.666 --> 1:14:52.291

1:15:06.500 --> 1:15:07.625
Again?

1:15:07.666 --> 1:15:10.541
Bill, I'll find a
way to pay for it.

1:15:10.583 --> 1:15:11.666
What?

1:15:11.708 --> 1:15:13.291
No, no I don't get
paid by the pile.

1:15:13.333 --> 1:15:14.333
Patrick!

1:15:14.375 --> 1:15:15.500
I'll call you back.

1:15:15.541 --> 1:15:16.625
What?

1:15:16.666 --> 1:15:18.166
Your friends are here.

1:15:24.875 --> 1:15:26.000
Hey.

1:15:27.833 --> 1:15:29.458
Hey.

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:30.791
I heard about your car.

1:15:30.833 --> 1:15:32.375
Yeah.

1:15:32.416 --> 1:15:35.375
Look, we got off to
a bad start, and I

1:15:35.416 --> 1:15:38.625
was thinking, if
you and Linda are

1:15:38.666 --> 1:15:42.500
going to be getting
married, or whatever,

1:15:42.541 --> 1:15:44.125
you're going to need money.

1:15:44.166 --> 1:15:45.125
OK.

1:15:45.166 --> 1:15:46.541
So?

1:15:46.583 --> 1:15:49.041
So Tony thinks his dad
would be willing to fix

1:15:49.083 --> 1:15:51.625
your car for free.

1:15:51.666 --> 1:15:53.333
Linda, being family and all.

1:15:53.375 --> 1:15:57.666
[music playing]

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:04.541
Cut.

1:16:04.583 --> 1:16:05.625
Ah.

1:16:05.666 --> 1:16:06.833
Do you mind?

1:16:06.875 --> 1:16:08.958
No, I don't mind
bringing in the groceries

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.291
even though it's your turn.

1:16:11.333 --> 1:16:13.166
Bill, you don't need
to check the mirror

1:16:13.208 --> 1:16:14.166
with your whole head.

1:16:14.208 --> 1:16:15.375
Just glance with your eyes.

1:16:15.416 --> 1:16:17.458
I was trying to show concern.

1:16:17.500 --> 1:16:19.041
Hey, you should be concerned.

1:16:19.083 --> 1:16:21.125
The corn's moving about
3,000 miles an hour.

1:16:21.166 --> 1:16:22.166
Excuse me?

1:16:22.208 --> 1:16:24.041
Corn's going by too fast.

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:28.458
The corn can never
go by too fast.

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:29.458
You know what? This is stupid.

1:16:29.500 --> 1:16:30.500
What's stupid?

1:16:30.541 --> 1:16:31.666
This whole movie thing.

1:16:31.708 --> 1:16:33.000
What do you think,
one of these movies

1:16:33.041 --> 1:16:34.125
is going to be seen by anyone

1:16:34.166 --> 1:16:35.208
other than you, me,
and your mom?

1:16:35.250 --> 1:16:36.625
Bill.

1:16:36.666 --> 1:16:38.458
You think having a premiere
at the Public Library

1:16:38.500 --> 1:16:40.041
is going to get you
noticed in Hollywood?

1:16:40.083 --> 1:16:41.291
OK, Bill, I'm sorry I
said you're corny.

1:16:41.333 --> 1:16:42.291
You're a good actor.

1:16:42.333 --> 1:16:44.291
No, I'm not. I'm terrible.

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:45.666
But at least I know it.

1:16:45.708 --> 1:16:47.500
Well, if you know
you're so terrible,

1:16:47.541 --> 1:16:48.791
why do you keep doing it?

1:16:48.833 --> 1:16:50.166
Because it used to be fun.

1:16:50.208 --> 1:16:51.541
Why do you keep doing it?

1:16:51.583 --> 1:16:53.625
Because you certainly
aren't having any fun.

1:16:53.666 --> 1:16:55.208
[engine revving]

1:16:55.250 --> 1:16:57.916
And when you're not having fun,
you are definitely not fun.

1:17:00.500 --> 1:17:03.208
I do it because
I'm not terrible.

1:17:03.250 --> 1:17:04.458
I'm just here.

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.375
Oh, so it's here
that's the problem?

1:17:07.416 --> 1:17:09.625
Here meaning all your
well-meaning but talentless

1:17:09.666 --> 1:17:11.291
friends holding you back, right?

1:17:11.333 --> 1:17:12.833
No.

1:17:12.875 --> 1:17:16.125
Fine, go to Hollywood so you
can be not terrible there.

1:17:16.166 --> 1:17:17.750
See how far that gets you.

1:18:01.166 --> 1:18:03.291

Can he say lesbians on
the morning announcements?

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.625
No, he cannot.

1:18:32.666 --> 1:18:36.291
Today is the last day of life
as we know it on this planet.

Today, a new and golden
age lies upon us.

1:18:39.875 --> 1:18:42.500
Today is the day that every

vocal sound effect

1:18:44.750 --> 1:18:46.291
you've heard from
these past few months

1:18:46.333 --> 1:18:47.458
will entirely make sense.

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:48.500

1:18:58.000 --> 1:18:59.625
Don't be scared.

1:18:59.666 --> 1:19:02.291
It's only an Imperial Cruiser
making the jump to lightspeed.

1:19:46.500 --> 1:19:47.625
Ah.

1:19:47.666 --> 1:19:49.083
What are you doing here?

1:19:49.125 --> 1:19:51.291
Linda had a conniption fit
because she had work for me

1:19:51.333 --> 1:19:52.375
today.

1:19:52.416 --> 1:19:54.166
So Dr. Kallen let
her off the hook,

1:19:54.208 --> 1:19:55.875
even though I called in sick.

1:19:55.916 --> 1:19:57.500
So where's Linda?

1:19:57.541 --> 1:19:58.791
She went to the mall.

1:19:58.833 --> 1:20:00.333
She said she had
to buy something

1:20:00.375 --> 1:20:02.000
nice to wear for big event.

1:20:07.208 --> 1:20:08.166

1:20:09.500 --> 1:20:10.458

1:20:22.166 --> 1:20:23.333
Where's Bill?

1:20:23.375 --> 1:20:26.000
He's hiding in his car.

1:20:26.041 --> 1:20:28.208
Hey, guys, don't forget
there's a party at my house

1:20:28.250 --> 1:20:29.791
tonight, 6:00.

1:20:29.833 --> 1:20:30.791
Thanks, Ann.

1:20:30.833 --> 1:20:31.833
That's great.

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.208
Drive, Bill.

1:20:37.250 --> 1:20:39.291
Just drive.

1:20:39.333 --> 1:20:42.500
I'll need your park ID.

1:20:42.541 --> 1:20:43.666
Can he do that?

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:44.958
Uh huh.

1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.833
Do you realize
what you just did?

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:48.666
Yeah, I got my severance
pay, which is more

1:20:48.708 --> 1:20:50.125
than I would have
gotten if I I'd

1:20:50.166 --> 1:20:51.791
worked for another
month, which means

1:20:51.833 --> 1:20:53.708
I can now pay for the
first 40 people to show up.

1:20:56.166 --> 1:20:57.291
Oh, shit.

1:20:57.333 --> 1:20:58.791
Oh, now you realize
what you just did.

1:20:58.833 --> 1:21:00.125
No, it's 2:14.

1:21:00.166 --> 1:21:02.375
Time flies when you're
throwing your life away.

1:21:02.416 --> 1:21:03.791
No, I mean I got to cash this.

1:21:03.833 --> 1:21:04.875
So we'll cash it.

1:21:04.916 --> 1:21:06.333
The theater's 15
minutes that way.

1:21:06.375 --> 1:21:08.125
My bank is 15 minutes
the other way.

1:21:08.166 --> 1:21:09.375
Pat, relax.

1:21:09.416 --> 1:21:11.166
My dad will cash your
check at the station.

1:21:11.208 --> 1:21:12.291
It's five minutes away.

1:21:12.333 --> 1:21:13.791
Sign it over to him.

1:21:13.833 --> 1:21:16.208
I'll go get the cash and
meet you at the mall at 2:45.

1:21:16.250 --> 1:21:18.666
But, no, it takes 15 minutes
to get to the theater.

1:21:18.708 --> 1:21:20.458
We can get there in 10.

OK.

1:21:32.375 --> 1:21:34.791
Slow down, you're going
to get all sweaty.

1:21:34.833 --> 1:21:36.625
Girls hate that.

1:21:36.666 --> 1:21:39.041
It's not like there's going
to be a line around the block

1:21:39.083 --> 1:21:40.000
to get in.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:41.000
Hey.

1:21:41.041 --> 1:21:42.791
Oh, hey.

1:21:42.833 --> 1:21:44.333
Hey.

What are you doing here?

1:21:45.666 --> 1:21:47.166
Picking you up.

1:21:47.208 --> 1:21:49.791
Bill's meeting us at 2:45.

1:21:49.833 --> 1:21:50.791
What?

1:21:50.833 --> 1:21:51.875
I can't go.

1:21:51.916 --> 1:21:53.166
Why not?

1:21:53.208 --> 1:21:55.041
Mom needs me to take
Misty to the vet.

1:21:55.083 --> 1:21:57.958
Oh, we'll take her afterwards.

1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.291
Tony is giving me a ride.

1:22:00.333 --> 1:22:01.625
Why?

1:22:01.666 --> 1:22:03.125
My car's in the shop.

1:22:03.166 --> 1:22:04.208
Again?

1:22:04.250 --> 1:22:05.375
Yeah, again.

1:22:05.416 --> 1:22:09.458
Wow, that's-- that's convenient.

1:22:09.500 --> 1:22:11.208
What's that supposed to mean?

1:22:11.250 --> 1:22:12.625
Well, let's see.

1:22:12.666 --> 1:22:15.041
First, Tony's dad can't
seem to find the left front

1:22:15.083 --> 1:22:16.958

Pinto for over a month.

1:22:17.000 --> 1:22:19.333
And then after managing
to finally scrape together

1:22:19.375 --> 1:22:20.625
enough money to pay him.

1:22:20.666 --> 1:22:22.625
He tells me he's been
charging me a storage fee

1:22:22.666 --> 1:22:24.333
on top of the original amount.

1:22:24.375 --> 1:22:26.666
And now your car's
back in the shop,

1:22:26.708 --> 1:22:29.458
and suddenly Tony is the only
one left with a car that works,

1:22:29.500 --> 1:22:31.166
which you have to go
back to your house in,

1:22:31.208 --> 1:22:32.458
with your new underwear.

1:22:32.500 --> 1:22:34.041
And no, can you tell
me what's wrong?

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:35.333
Yeah, I can.

1:22:35.375 --> 1:22:37.500
You don't know when
to stop thinking.

1:22:40.666 --> 1:22:41.875
What?

1:22:41.916 --> 1:22:42.958
Wait.

to stop thinking?

Oh, come on.

1:22:55.083 --> 1:22:56.791
I'm sorry.

1:22:56.833 --> 1:23:01.458
Don't even talk to me,
and don't call me either.

1:23:01.500 --> 1:23:02.958
Wait, don't leave.

I didn't say I'd
go to bed with you.

me in a hotel room room

to go to bed with me?

I thought you were going
to be first in line.

Things got messed up.

1:25:37.166 --> 1:25:38.500
What happened?

1:25:38.541 --> 1:25:41.833
Dodgeball accident,
then I missed the bus.

And next thing I know,
it starts raining,

1:25:44.666 --> 1:25:46.375
and Jody saw me walking home.

1:25:46.416 --> 1:25:48.833
You should have run him over.

1:25:48.875 --> 1:25:50.958
What's wrong with her?

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.958
She's 16.

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.458
She's a girl.

1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:55.791
Plus, she hates me.

1:25:55.833 --> 1:25:57.125
She doesn't hate you.

1:25:57.166 --> 1:25:59.291
I do so.

1:25:59.333 --> 1:26:02.125
If she hated you, why
would she drive you home?

1:26:02.166 --> 1:26:07.000
So she could enjoy not
driving me to the theater.

1:26:07.041 --> 1:26:08.458
Can I borrow the van?

1:26:08.500 --> 1:26:10.458
Eric took it down to O'Hare.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:11.875
What for?

1:26:11.916 --> 1:26:14.291
To ship a dog I sold
some people in Atlanta.

1:26:14.333 --> 1:26:16.375
They wired the money, thank God.

1:26:16.416 --> 1:26:18.833
Great.

1:26:18.875 --> 1:26:21.125
Could I borrow $200?

1:26:21.166 --> 1:26:22.291
I don't know.

When you walked by

1:26:23.916 --> 1:26:25.333
notice 2 million piles of poop?

1:26:25.375 --> 1:26:27.125
What the heck do
you need $200 for?

1:26:27.166 --> 1:26:30.791
To pay for 40 of my friends
to get in to see "Star Wars."

1:26:30.833 --> 1:26:33.541
You know, they say if you
have three good friends

1:26:33.583 --> 1:26:35.458

No, I sold my bike to

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:36.291
Jeez, will you relax?

1:27:36.333 --> 1:27:37.791
Relax?

that's the truth.

1:36:12.041 --> 1:36:13.625
You are so full of shit.

1:36:13.666 --> 1:36:14.875
Where do you come
up with that crap?

1:36:14.916 --> 1:36:16.125
Advanced placement psychology.

1:36:16.166 --> 1:36:17.291
You were my term paper.

1:36:17.333 --> 1:36:18.791
Come on, Pat.

1:36:18.833 --> 1:36:20.125
Your parents start
talking divorce,

1:36:20.166 --> 1:36:21.041
you start making movies.

1:36:21.083 --> 1:36:22.125
Why?

1:36:22.166 --> 1:36:23.208
Because I like to.

1:36:23.250 --> 1:36:24.875
You did it to get
their attention.

1:36:24.916 --> 1:36:26.625
So they'd have something
else to think about,

1:36:26.666 --> 1:36:28.958
like you had something other
than them that made you happy.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.791
You figured, if they saw
they were losing you,

1:36:30.833 --> 1:36:32.125
maybe they'd stop fighting.

1:36:32.166 --> 1:36:34.458
Sorry, Sigmund, but you're
wrong on this one, OK?

1:36:34.500 --> 1:36:35.500
So what happens?

1:36:35.541 --> 1:36:36.958
Your mom fawns over every frame,

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:38.333
thinks every shot is wonderful.

1:36:38.375 --> 1:36:39.541
And you know it's not true.

1:36:39.583 --> 1:36:40.791
So you start to distrust her.

1:36:40.833 --> 1:36:42.041
She's not leveling with you.

1:36:42.083 --> 1:36:43.791
She's just treating you
like her little baby

1:36:43.833 --> 1:36:44.958
that needs protecting.

1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:46.458
And your dad, who's drunk
half the time,

1:36:46.500 --> 1:36:47.958
can only see you
as his younger self

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:49.125
who wanted to be an artist

1:36:49.166 --> 1:36:50.333
till his dad threatened
to disown him

1:36:50.375 --> 1:36:51.708
if he didn't go to
med school, right?

1:36:51.750 --> 1:36:53.458
So here you come with
your first little Super

1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:55.375
8 "Planet of the Apes"
movie, and what does he do?

1:36:55.416 --> 1:36:56.458
OK, Donny.

1:36:56.500 --> 1:36:57.666
He shits all over it.

1:36:57.708 --> 1:36:59.291
OK, Donny, enough.

1:36:59.333 --> 1:37:01.125
It looks like a model.
You ever hear of focus?

1:37:01.166 --> 1:37:03.166
And they invented tripods
for a reason, you know?

1:37:03.208 --> 1:37:06.125
And how about this little gem,
is that like a Charlton Heston?

1:37:06.166 --> 1:37:08.708
It looked like a 12-year-old
with delusions of grandeur.

1:37:08.750 --> 1:37:10.875
You were a 12-year-old
with delusions of grandeur.

1:37:10.916 --> 1:37:12.375
Donnie, shut up, OK?
Just shut up.

1:37:12.416 --> 1:37:13.625
Fine, as soon as you admit

1:37:13.666 --> 1:37:15.291
the real reason
you want to make movies.

1:37:15.333 --> 1:37:17.625
Because it cuts through all the
stupid high school social caste

1:37:17.666 --> 1:37:18.625
system bullshit, OK?

1:37:18.666 --> 1:37:20.291
OK.

1:37:20.333 --> 1:37:22.458
It gets past all those stupid
goddamn armor everyone wears.

1:37:22.500 --> 1:37:23.625
Go on.

1:37:23.666 --> 1:37:25.166
When you're watching
a movie, you're

1:37:25.208 --> 1:37:27.291
sitting with 500 people who
wouldn't even sit next to you

1:37:27.333 --> 1:37:28.458
in lunch.

1:37:28.500 --> 1:37:30.333
And you're laughing
at the same jokes,

1:37:30.375 --> 1:37:32.375
and crying at the
same painful moments,

1:37:32.416 --> 1:37:34.125
and you're jumping
at the same scares.

1:37:34.166 --> 1:37:36.458
There aren't any cliques
in the movie theater.

1:37:36.500 --> 1:37:39.666
There aren't any jocks, or
geeks, or nerds, or brains, OK?

1:37:39.708 --> 1:37:41.291
And as long as it's
dark, and there's

1:37:41.333 --> 1:37:43.166
something you've never
seen before on the screen,

1:37:43.208 --> 1:37:46.500
it's like you're
family, where nobody

1:37:46.541 --> 1:37:49.666
yells or fights or leaves.

1:37:53.916 --> 1:37:55.166
Oh, shit.

1:37:57.750 --> 1:37:59.333
You know, years
from now, are you

1:37:59.375 --> 1:38:01.333
going to pay someone
hundreds of dollars

1:38:01.375 --> 1:38:03.625
to do what I just did for free?

1:38:03.666 --> 1:38:06.000
[laughter]

1:38:09.166 --> 1:38:10.791
Congratulations. It's a fist.

1:38:10.833 --> 1:38:11.791
[laughter]

1:38:11.833 --> 1:38:13.291
You've got her hand out?

1:38:13.333 --> 1:38:14.958
Oh, no problem with that.

1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:16.833
Doctor gave her a
little muscle relaxant.

1:38:25.333 --> 1:38:26.375
Here.

1:38:26.416 --> 1:38:28.125
You may need just for the drool.

1:38:28.166 --> 1:38:29.500
[laughter]

1:38:32.708 --> 1:38:35.041
What?

1:38:35.083 --> 1:38:36.666
Come on, I'll take you home.

1:38:36.708 --> 1:38:38.208
Wait, what about "Star Wars?"

1:38:38.250 --> 1:38:40.000
Gah!

1:38:40.041 --> 1:38:42.958
It's dark in the theater.

1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:44.500
[music playing]

1:38:44.541 --> 1:38:48.625
[SINGING] Music
Radio WLS Chicago.

1:38:48.666 --> 1:38:51.166
[MUSIC - ALAN PARSONS, "I CAN'T
GET THERE FROM HERE"]

1:38:57.375 --> 1:38:59.625
It's me.

1:38:59.666 --> 1:39:01.958
I told you not to call.

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:02.958
I know.

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.166
I'm sorry.

1:39:04.208 --> 1:39:09.125
It's just-- I realized
something tonight.

1:39:09.166 --> 1:39:12.291
I thought that it was going
to be the most important day

1:39:12.333 --> 1:39:15.666
of my life because it would
finally give me the strength

1:39:15.708 --> 1:39:20.708
to go out to LA and start up a
life I thought we both wanted.

1:39:20.750 --> 1:39:23.458
But when today finally
came, it wasn't enough

1:39:23.500 --> 1:39:25.458
for me to just see
"Star Wars" by myself.

1:39:25.500 --> 1:39:28.291
I felt I had to take everyone
I knew with me because I think

1:39:28.333 --> 1:39:30.541
what I really wanted
was for everyone

1:39:30.583 --> 1:39:34.291
to finally understand
me and approve of me.

1:39:34.333 --> 1:39:37.625
So that it would change this
place enough, in my mind

1:39:37.666 --> 1:39:43.833
and in my heart, that I wouldn't
have to leave it because I

1:39:43.875 --> 1:39:45.291
don't really want to go.

1:39:45.333 --> 1:39:47.125
[SINGING] There were
dreams we kept inside.

1:39:47.166 --> 1:39:48.250
I just want to belong.

1:39:50.333 --> 1:39:51.500
OK, Linda-chan.

1:39:51.541 --> 1:39:53.666
I go to work now.

1:39:53.708 --> 1:39:54.958
OK.

1:39:55.000 --> 1:39:56.333
Drive carefully, mom.

1:40:00.041 --> 1:40:05.666
[SINGING] I can't
get there from here.

1:40:05.708 --> 1:40:06.958
And you can't--

1:40:07.000 --> 1:40:09.125
Pat, you've been waiting
a really long time

1:40:09.166 --> 1:40:10.958
for this night.

1:40:11.000 --> 1:40:14.958
And maybe I didn't seem as
interested as you sometimes,

1:40:15.000 --> 1:40:18.500
but I really did want to
be with you the first time.

1:40:21.208 --> 1:40:22.791
And I really want
to be with you.

1:40:22.833 --> 1:40:25.625
[SINGING] Nowhere.

1:40:25.666 --> 1:40:27.791
OK, then.

1:40:27.833 --> 1:40:29.625
Come and get me.

1:40:29.666 --> 1:40:33.000
[SINGING] Touch the sky.

1:40:33.041 --> 1:40:38.625
If you don't, when you grow
old, you'll wonder why.

1:40:38.666 --> 1:40:41.291
You did just what you were told.

1:40:41.333 --> 1:40:44.833
No one will cry for you.

1:40:44.875 --> 1:40:49.041
And all you do is long to fly.

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:56.041
I can see--

1:40:56.083 --> 1:40:57.458
Beam me up, Jody.

1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:00.541
[SINGING] The final
curtain calling, let it be.

1:41:00.583 --> 1:41:03.125
[knocking]

1:41:03.166 --> 1:41:07.458
[SINGING] Listen to the voices
calling out to all who hear.

1:41:07.500 --> 1:41:09.291
You ready?

1:41:09.333 --> 1:41:13.708
[SINGING] Don't let your
fear push life beside.

1:41:18.208 --> 1:41:23.791
I can't get there from here.

1:41:23.833 --> 1:41:25.125
And you can't get--

1:41:25.166 --> 1:41:26.458
Oh.

1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:29.958
[SINGING] --here from there.

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:35.375
And we can't go anywhere.

1:41:35.416 --> 1:41:36.791
Why the long face?

1:41:36.833 --> 1:41:37.791
Ah!

1:41:37.833 --> 1:41:38.791
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

1:41:38.833 --> 1:41:39.875
I can't help it.

1:41:39.916 --> 1:41:43.833
Making jokes, it's what I do.

1:41:43.875 --> 1:41:45.166
Duh.

1:41:48.875 --> 1:41:50.791
Are you sure about this?

1:41:50.833 --> 1:41:52.958
Uh huh.

1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:57.791
[SINGING] Far beyond
all the things we know.

1:41:57.833 --> 1:41:58.833
Mm-mm.

1:41:58.875 --> 1:42:01.125
Wait.

1:42:01.166 --> 1:42:04.291
[SINGING] The world
of our dreams.

1:42:04.333 --> 1:42:05.333
[television chatter]

1:42:05.375 --> 1:42:06.791
[SINGING] Calling to us--

1:42:06.833 --> 1:42:08.041
You want to watch baseball?

1:42:08.083 --> 1:42:10.166
[SINGING] --but we don't go.

1:42:10.208 --> 1:42:13.291
I want the neighbors to think
we're watching baseball.

1:42:13.333 --> 1:42:18.125
Plus, it'll cover any, you
know, noise we might make.

1:42:18.166 --> 1:42:19.500
Now, close your eyes.

1:42:19.541 --> 1:42:23.833
[SINGING] You can't
get here from there.

1:42:23.875 --> 1:42:29.958
And we can't go anywhere.

1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:36.791
As long as we're still standing
on the road that leads nowhere.

1:42:36.833 --> 1:42:40.625
When I was a kid, they used
to show these short films

1:42:40.666 --> 1:42:42.333
before the feature
called serials,

1:42:42.375 --> 1:42:43.958
and they weren't very good.

1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.791
In fact, they were actually kind
of terrible in a wonderful sort

1:42:46.833 --> 1:42:49.291
of way because you could almost
imagine the actors suddenly

1:42:49.333 --> 1:42:50.958
turning to look out
at you and saying,

1:42:51.000 --> 1:42:53.291
look, we know you can tell
we made these sets out

1:42:53.333 --> 1:42:56.541
of cardboard, and we know you
can see the wires holding up

1:42:56.583 --> 1:43:01.375
our spaceships, but look
how much fun we're having.

1:43:03.333 --> 1:43:07.000
And those stupid little
films meant more to me

1:43:07.041 --> 1:43:11.833
than any big budget
Hollywood extravaganza

1:43:11.875 --> 1:43:14.833
because they gave me hope
that, with a little allowance,

1:43:14.875 --> 1:43:21.541
a little ingenuity, and a
little stolen time with my dad's

1:43:21.583 --> 1:43:24.041
old wind-up movie camera,
I could make movies too.

1:43:24.083 --> 1:43:25.458
And I did.

1:43:25.500 --> 1:43:28.291
Boy, did I.

1:43:28.333 --> 1:43:31.625
How much do you want to
be a director, Patrick?

1:43:31.666 --> 1:43:35.166
I want it more than anything
I've ever wanted in my life.

1:43:35.208 --> 1:43:37.125
Are you-- are you
really sure about this?

1:43:37.166 --> 1:43:40.000
Do you need to be one?

1:43:44.541 --> 1:43:46.208
Then you might just make it.

1:43:48.875 --> 1:43:49.875
You really think so?

1:43:51.916 --> 1:43:54.625
If it can happen to me,
it can happen to you.

1:43:54.666 --> 1:43:56.375
[thunder]

1:44:04.333 --> 1:44:05.583
So how was it?

1:44:08.708 --> 1:44:11.125
It was amazing.

1:44:11.166 --> 1:44:13.125
How about for you?

1:44:13.166 --> 1:44:15.625
I meant "Star Wars."

1:44:15.666 --> 1:44:18.125
Oh.

1:44:18.166 --> 1:44:20.125
I don't know.

1:44:20.166 --> 1:44:21.500
Too many things came up.

1:44:23.666 --> 1:44:26.125
You could go tomorrow.

1:44:26.166 --> 1:44:28.000
I could maybe get off work.

1:44:28.041 --> 1:44:30.708
No, I have to work.

1:44:30.750 --> 1:44:35.708
I got to start saving up
for everything we want.

1:44:37.666 --> 1:44:43.333
I'll try to see it on my next
day off, if it's still playing.

1:44:45.166 --> 1:44:46.875
The crowd's loving it.

1:44:46.916 --> 1:44:50.833
Now the big guy, hitting
.342 with 92 RBIs.

1:44:50.875 --> 1:44:53.333
More baseball after
these messages.

1:44:53.375 --> 1:44:54.875
Hey, Pete Rose,
what do men really

1:44:54.916 --> 1:44:56.666
want from his after shave?

1:44:56.708 --> 1:44:58.541
Are you sorry we did this?

1:44:58.583 --> 1:44:59.791
No.

1:44:59.833 --> 1:45:03.041
No fancy perfumes
or fancy bottles.

1:45:03.083 --> 1:45:04.708
Did you want to
wait till you get

1:45:04.750 --> 1:45:06.791
married before your first time?

1:45:06.833 --> 1:45:07.958
Uh-uh.

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:09.333
A man wants to smell like a man.

1:45:09.375 --> 1:45:11.500
That's why I like--

1:45:11.541 --> 1:45:13.791
And so Refreshing and masculine.

1:45:13.833 --> 1:45:15.125
What? What?

1:45:15.166 --> 1:45:16.291
What did I say?

1:45:16.333 --> 1:45:17.500
Shut up. Just shut up, OK?

1:45:17.541 --> 1:45:18.875
What?

1:45:18.916 --> 1:45:20.208
What?

1:45:20.250 --> 1:45:21.458
What did I do?

1:45:21.500 --> 1:45:22.875
You didn't do anything.

1:45:22.916 --> 1:45:25.083
OK, well then tell
me what's wrong.

1:45:29.916 --> 1:45:31.833
This wasn't my first time.

1:45:34.333 --> 1:45:36.458
Oh.

1:45:36.500 --> 1:45:38.791
Well, that's OK.

1:45:38.833 --> 1:45:39.875
No, it's not.

1:45:39.916 --> 1:45:41.041
I don't care.

1:45:41.083 --> 1:45:42.125
I care.

1:45:42.166 --> 1:45:43.125
Why?

1:45:43.166 --> 1:45:44.541
Why?

1:45:44.583 --> 1:45:47.041
What does it matter what we
did before we met, right?

1:45:47.083 --> 1:45:48.791
I don't have to be your first.

1:45:48.833 --> 1:45:50.958
I just have to be your
best and your last.

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:52.000
It matters!

1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.166
What?

1:45:58.333 --> 1:46:08.708
It matters because
my first time was

1:46:08.750 --> 1:46:10.416
while you were in Hollywood.

1:46:15.833 --> 1:46:17.958
I didn't know if
you'd be coming back.

1:46:18.000 --> 1:46:20.791
You were so excited about
going and maybe getting a job.

1:46:20.833 --> 1:46:24.125
I didn't know you'd
come back just for me.

1:46:24.166 --> 1:46:25.958
You were the only
reason I came back, OK?

1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:27.041
You said you loved me.

1:46:27.083 --> 1:46:28.291
I do love you.

1:46:28.333 --> 1:46:30.125
Well, you have a funny
way of showing it.

1:46:30.166 --> 1:46:32.125
You know, this wasn't
your first time either.

1:46:32.166 --> 1:46:33.125
Yeah, it was.

1:46:33.166 --> 1:46:34.458
No, it wasn't.

1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:36.500
Your first time was the
day you saw the coming

1:46:36.541 --> 1:46:37.625
attractions for "Star Wars."

1:46:37.666 --> 1:46:39.041
What?

1:46:39.083 --> 1:46:41.375
[MUSIC - ALAN PARSONS PROJECT,
"DON'T LET IT SHOW"]

1:46:41.416 --> 1:46:43.000
When it was over, I
looked over at you,

1:46:43.041 --> 1:46:44.291
and you had tears in your eyes.

1:46:44.333 --> 1:46:45.625
So?

1:46:45.666 --> 1:46:48.541
So how could I ever hope
to compete with that?

1:46:48.583 --> 1:46:50.208
Why Tony?

1:46:50.250 --> 1:46:51.333
Huh?

1:46:51.375 --> 1:46:53.166
What the hell is
so great about him?

1:46:53.208 --> 1:46:54.958
Is it his car, or
his gold chains,

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:56.291
or his feeble little mustache?

1:46:56.333 --> 1:46:57.541
His zip code.

1:46:57.583 --> 1:46:58.541
What?

1:46:58.583 --> 1:46:59.625
He's here.

1:46:59.666 --> 1:47:01.041
I am here.

1:47:01.083 --> 1:47:05.333
But he's not going anywhere,
and I'm OK with that.

1:47:05.375 --> 1:47:06.916
In fact, it's what I want.

1:47:06.958 --> 1:47:10.041
[SINGING] Though it's getting
harder to take what they say,

1:47:10.083 --> 1:47:13.875
just let it go.

1:47:13.916 --> 1:47:16.083
Just let it go.

1:47:20.041 --> 1:47:24.291
And if it hurts when
they mention my name,

1:47:24.333 --> 1:47:27.208
say you don't know me.

1:47:27.250 --> 1:47:30.833
And if it helps when
they say I'm to blame,

1:47:30.875 --> 1:47:32.958
say you don't own me.

1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.791
Just remember
something, life doesn't

1:47:35.833 --> 1:47:40.791
move at 24 frames per second.

1:47:40.833 --> 1:47:42.458
It moves a lot faster.

1:47:42.500 --> 1:47:44.500
[SINGING] Even if it's
taking the easy way out.

1:47:44.541 --> 1:47:46.125
And on this picture--

1:47:46.166 --> 1:47:47.625
[SINGING] Keep it inside of you.

1:47:47.666 --> 1:47:49.125
You only get one roll film.

1:47:49.166 --> 1:47:50.666
[SINGING] Don't give in.

1:47:50.708 --> 1:47:54.041
Don't tell them anything.

1:47:54.083 --> 1:47:58.875
Don't let it--
don't let it show.

1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:19.958
Even though you know it's
the wrong thing to say,

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:25.041
say you don't care,
say you don't care.

1:48:29.041 --> 1:48:33.875
Even if you want to
believe there's a way,

1:48:33.916 --> 1:48:37.625
I won't be there.

1:48:37.666 --> 1:48:40.166
I won't be there.

1:48:43.500 --> 1:48:47.958
But if you smile when
they mention my name,

1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:51.208
they'll never know you.

1:48:51.250 --> 1:48:55.125
And if you laugh when
they say I'm to blame,

1:48:55.166 --> 1:48:58.208
they'll never own you.

1:48:58.250 --> 1:48:59.916
Ooh.

1:49:03.833 --> 1:49:05.541
Hey.

1:49:05.583 --> 1:49:08.666
[SINGING] Even if you feel
you've got nothing to hide.

1:49:08.708 --> 1:49:10.458
Mom wants us to go
grocery shopping.

1:49:10.500 --> 1:49:11.958
[SINGING] Keep it inside of you.

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.125
Don't give in.

1:49:13.166 --> 1:49:14.208
Come on.

1:49:14.250 --> 1:49:16.791
[SINGING] Don't
tell them anything.

1:49:16.833 --> 1:49:18.125
Why are you helping me?

1:49:18.166 --> 1:49:19.541
[SINGING] Don't let it--

1:49:19.583 --> 1:49:22.041
Because numbskull, how could
you leave without a car?

1:49:22.083 --> 1:49:24.333
[SINGING] Don't let it show.

1:49:30.208 --> 1:49:31.208
Bye.

1:49:49.500 --> 1:49:52.333
What are you still
doing in your backyard?

1:50:13.500 --> 1:50:15.750
[barking]

1:50:20.166 --> 1:50:21.958
Where do you think you're going?

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.791
To get my car.

1:50:24.833 --> 1:50:27.041
Is that so?

1:50:27.083 --> 1:50:29.791
Yeah, I paid all I'm
going to pay for it.

1:50:29.833 --> 1:50:33.625
Besides, you don't need to
hold it hostage anymore.

1:50:33.666 --> 1:50:35.333
I'm not going to stop you.

1:50:35.375 --> 1:50:37.166
Scrawny piece of shit.

1:50:37.208 --> 1:50:40.625
You couldn't stop rain
from hitting the ground.

1:50:40.666 --> 1:50:46.333
Yeah, well, I'll tell you
what, I'll try to gain weight,

1:50:46.375 --> 1:50:47.958
you try to gain intelligence.

1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:49.458
We'll see who wins.

1:50:49.500 --> 1:50:51.500
Huh, I already know who
wins, and it ain't you.

1:50:51.541 --> 1:50:52.625
And you're going down.

1:50:52.666 --> 1:50:54.166
Oh.

1:50:54.208 --> 1:50:56.000
[music playing]

1:50:57.833 --> 1:50:59.791
Get up.

1:50:59.833 --> 1:51:02.000
Oh, jeez, Tony.

1:51:02.041 --> 1:51:04.458
Down, up, make up your mind.

1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:06.458
I said get up.

1:51:06.500 --> 1:51:08.625
It's time someone
kicked your ass.

1:51:08.666 --> 1:51:10.125
What's wrong?

1:51:10.166 --> 1:51:12.125
Don't you think you've
done enough to me?

1:51:12.166 --> 1:51:13.541
What are you talking about?

1:51:13.583 --> 1:51:16.166
You knew that Linda was
scared to go with me,

1:51:16.208 --> 1:51:18.958
and you played on it until
you finally brought her down

1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:21.208
to your level.

1:51:21.250 --> 1:51:23.500
My level?

1:51:23.541 --> 1:51:25.958
Oh!

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.541
What's my level, huh?

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:31.541
I work for a living.

1:51:31.583 --> 1:51:35.125
I don't expect the world owes
me fame and fortune like you.

1:51:35.166 --> 1:51:37.625
You know, you think because
you can direct little Super 8

1:51:37.666 --> 1:51:39.375
movies you can direct
how people's lives are

1:51:39.416 --> 1:51:40.541
going to turn out?

1:51:40.583 --> 1:51:41.791
I mean, come on.

1:51:41.833 --> 1:51:43.625
How are you going to
direct your way out

1:51:43.666 --> 1:51:46.000
of me dislocating your
shoulder if I want to, huh?

1:51:46.041 --> 1:51:47.833
How are you going to
direct your way out

1:51:47.875 --> 1:51:49.500
of me shoving your
face into the dirt

1:51:49.541 --> 1:51:51.041
until you choked to
death, if I want?

1:51:51.083 --> 1:51:52.625
Huh?

1:51:52.666 --> 1:51:56.458
Your brain may think of
better fantasies than mine,

1:51:56.500 --> 1:51:59.291
but it ain't going to think
of nothing if I beat it out

1:51:59.333 --> 1:52:01.958
of your head with a fucking
tire iron now, is it?

1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000
Is it?

1:52:04.041 --> 1:52:05.625
Oh!

1:52:05.666 --> 1:52:09.000
[coughs]

Never fuck with a Kubrick fan.

1:52:11.833 --> 1:52:13.291
A what?

1:52:13.333 --> 1:52:16.625
We may be geeks on the
outside, but on the inside,

1:52:16.666 --> 1:52:18.291
we're all killer apes.

1:52:18.333 --> 1:52:19.958
You're fucking nuts
is what you are.

1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:21.541
Oh, no, I'm not nuts.

1:52:21.583 --> 1:52:22.958
I'm evolved.

1:52:23.000 --> 1:52:25.958
My ancestors touched
the monolith.

1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.625
Your ancestors watched.

1:52:28.666 --> 1:52:29.791
Jesus, back off, man.

1:52:29.833 --> 1:52:30.833
Jesus.

1:52:30.875 --> 1:52:32.500
You mated with my mate.

1:52:32.541 --> 1:52:33.625
What?

1:52:33.666 --> 1:52:35.791
You rained on my
evolutionary parade.

1:52:35.833 --> 1:52:38.041
No, wait, wait.

1:52:38.083 --> 1:52:40.458
You want to compete with
me for scarce resources

1:52:40.500 --> 1:52:43.291
on this dusty African plane?

1:52:43.333 --> 1:52:44.916
Well, step to the plate.

1:52:47.666 --> 1:52:49.125
I am Moon Watcher.

1:52:49.166 --> 1:52:50.458
Hear me roar.

1:52:50.500 --> 1:52:51.666
No, stop!

1:52:51.708 --> 1:52:53.208
We didn't really do it, OK?

1:52:53.250 --> 1:52:54.958
I tried, but she
wouldn't go for it.

1:52:55.000 --> 1:52:56.458
She said she was
in love with you.

1:52:56.500 --> 1:52:58.458
She wanted to be
with you, I swear.

1:52:58.500 --> 1:52:59.625
She waited for you.

1:52:59.666 --> 1:53:02.625
We never did it.

1:53:02.666 --> 1:53:05.125
Than why would she
tell me you did?

1:53:05.166 --> 1:53:06.875

Popcorns, two Cokes,
and one Sugar Baby.

1:53:52.416 --> 1:53:54.833
Is this film ever going
to stop showing here?

1:53:57.500 --> 1:53:58.583
OK, bye.

1:54:06.541 --> 1:54:07.833
What are you doing here?

1:54:10.500 --> 1:54:12.958
Why is that up there?

1:54:13.000 --> 1:54:15.000
Why is what up where?

1:54:16.500 --> 1:54:22.375
That, that-- that's not--
that's not what's playing here.

1:54:22.416 --> 1:54:23.791
Yes, it is.

1:54:23.833 --> 1:54:27.041
Todd, OK.

1:54:27.083 --> 1:54:29.625
I know you're most likely
messing with me right now.

1:54:29.666 --> 1:54:30.625
And it's funny.

1:54:30.666 --> 1:54:31.750
It really is.

1:54:31.791 --> 1:54:33.666
And any other day,
I would laugh at it.

1:54:33.708 --> 1:54:36.791
I would find it
thoroughly amusing.

1:54:36.833 --> 1:54:40.166
This is the thing, I
just want you to tell me

1:54:40.208 --> 1:54:41.875
that "Star Wars"
is playing here,

1:54:41.916 --> 1:54:44.833
and then we can just, you
know, be friends after that.

1:54:44.875 --> 1:54:47.125
And I just want you to
be honest with me now.

1:54:47.166 --> 1:54:48.375
Please, buddy.

1:54:48.416 --> 1:54:50.125
Todd, I love you.

1:54:50.166 --> 1:54:52.625
Come on, just tell me
what's playing here.

1:54:52.666 --> 1:54:53.625
"Star Wars," right?

1:54:53.666 --> 1:54:54.541
"Star Wars."

1:54:56.666 --> 1:54:58.291
"Star Wars?"

1:54:58.333 --> 1:55:01.291
Yes, yes!

1:55:01.333 --> 1:55:03.458
"Star Wars."

1:55:03.500 --> 1:55:05.208
OK, you know what?

1:55:05.250 --> 1:55:06.625
Look.

1:55:06.666 --> 1:55:08.291
"Star Wars!"

1:55:08.333 --> 1:55:12.541
"Star Wars" starts today,
today, at theaters everywhere.

1:55:15.166 --> 1:55:16.750
Theaters everywhere.

1:55:20.208 --> 1:55:22.958
This isn't everywhere.

1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:25.791
[laughs] This is Lake County.

1:55:25.833 --> 1:55:35.625
[laughs] Everywhere.

1:55:35.666 --> 1:55:36.625

1:55:36.666 --> 1:55:39.666
[laughs] Oh.

1:55:39.708 --> 1:55:40.791
Todd.

1:55:40.833 --> 1:55:42.041
Oh, really killing me.

1:55:42.083 --> 1:55:43.041
Todd.

1:56:04.166 --> 1:56:07.083
Your muttloaf, sir.

1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:22.041
What are you doing
here, Johnson?

1:56:22.083 --> 1:56:24.291
Eating muttloaf.

1:56:24.333 --> 1:56:26.500
Huh.

1:56:26.541 --> 1:56:28.666
Well, it's Senior Skip Day.

1:56:28.708 --> 1:56:32.291
Why aren't you skipping?

1:56:32.333 --> 1:56:33.833
More muttloaf for me.

1:56:37.666 --> 1:56:39.583
You're a weird kid, Johnson.

1:56:48.333 --> 1:56:52.208
Not weird enough, apparently.

1:56:52.250 --> 1:56:54.708
Don't underestimate
yourself, Patty.

1:56:56.416 --> 1:56:58.291
Let's go.

1:56:58.333 --> 1:57:00.666
Where?

1:57:00.708 --> 1:57:05.666
Someplace dark and quiet, where
I can take away your virginity.

1:57:08.166 --> 1:57:09.750
Well, you're too late.
