                      FRANK: Me!

05:31.864 --> 05:34.498
                I'll go next.   
Okay. Go ahead,                 
Frank.                          

05:34.500 --> 05:38.803
 "Discuss the part of your body 
    you are most proud of."     

05:40.406 --> 05:41.705
          That's a snap.        

05:41.707 --> 05:46.244
    It is? It wasn't            
such a snap for Archie.         

05:46.246 --> 05:47.312
                For me,         
                  it's easy.    

05:47.314 --> 05:48.879
Go ahead, Frank.                
The world is waiting.           

05:48.881 --> 05:50.014
                All right,      
                all right.      

05:50.016 --> 05:52.016
    The part of my body         

05:52.018 --> 05:56.087
      I am most proud of        
         is...my nose.          

05:56.089 --> 05:57.655
Your nose?                      

05:57.657 --> 05:59.723
                Don't laugh!    
        They don't make noses   
             like this anymore. 

05:59.725 --> 06:02.827
     They don't make Edsels     
        anymore either.         

06:02.829 --> 06:05.729
    You don't hear Ford         
    bragging about it.          

06:05.731 --> 06:08.499
                 Let me give you
                  the full view.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.968
    Observe the nose.           

06:09.970 --> 06:12.803
    Notice how it cuts out,     
        down and under,         

06:12.805 --> 06:14.138
      like a Roman eagle.       

06:14.140 --> 06:16.507
And behold the full flare       
        of the nostrils,        

06:16.509 --> 06:20.811
      proudly proclaiming,      
  "Leave the breathing to us."  

06:20.813 --> 06:22.847
                  I got With It.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.682
                        IRENE:  
                     Oh, no, no.

06:24.684 --> 06:26.517
He's copping out.               
Frank, you're copping out.      

06:26.519 --> 06:28.853
It's not your nose              
you love the most.              

06:28.855 --> 06:30.188
            Irene, I got four   
                    With Its.   

06:30.190 --> 06:32.223
  No, no, wait a second.        
 That's part of the game.       

06:32.225 --> 06:34.025
  If Irene can persuade us      
  that you're copping out,      

06:34.027 --> 06:35.226
    then we can change          
        our votes.              

06:35.228 --> 06:36.727
      That's in the rules.      

06:36.729 --> 06:39.530
Now, Irene, if it's not his nose
 he loves the most, what is it? 

06:39.532 --> 06:40.931
It's his body.                  

06:40.933 --> 06:42.633
                        Irene,  
                     cut it out.

06:44.769 --> 06:46.237
      He loves that body?       

06:48.173 --> 06:50.441
Well, actually,                 
it's his skin.                  

06:50.443 --> 06:52.877
It's soft and smooth            
like a baby's bottom.           

06:52.879 --> 06:54.012
                     [LAUGHS]   
                      Irene.    

06:54.014 --> 06:55.779
He hasn't got a hair            
on his chest.                   

06:55.781 --> 06:57.982
                    Irene,      
                cut it out, huh?

06:57.984 --> 07:00.985
He takes about                  
a half-hour to put              
his shirt on in the morning.    

07:00.987 --> 07:03.454
He hates to cover up            
all that beauty.                

07:03.456 --> 07:07.258
 A half-hour to put my shirt on?
It only takes me 20 minutes.    

07:07.260 --> 07:09.227
Oh. Then you do                 
love your body                  

07:09.229 --> 07:10.428
more than you love              
your nose,                      

07:10.430 --> 07:11.929
so I give you                   
a Cop Out.                      

07:11.931 --> 07:13.131
        Cop Out, Frank.         

07:13.133 --> 07:14.932
Hey, Lionel, why don't you      
        give one a try?         

07:14.934 --> 07:16.534
Okay.                           

07:16.536 --> 07:17.768
 "Choose a member of the group. 

07:17.770 --> 07:19.203
"Now standing back-to-back      
     and pushing each other,    

07:19.205 --> 07:21.805
    tell him why it is hard     
for you to be direct with him." 

07:21.807 --> 07:23.774
     It's too bad, Lionel.      
    Archie's not here.          

07:23.776 --> 07:25.809
      You'll have to pass.      

07:25.811 --> 07:28.446
     No, no. I choose you.      

07:28.448 --> 07:30.014
              Me?               
Yeah, yeah.                     
Come on.                        

07:30.016 --> 07:31.082
                          FRANK:
                        Come on!
                    Go ahead.   

07:31.084 --> 07:32.750
                        Fine.   
                  What the heck?
                    I'm game.   

07:32.752 --> 07:34.285
        All right, let's see.   
          Standing back-to-back.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.886
                  Here we are.  

07:35.888 --> 07:38.556
              Now tell me why   
             it's hard for you  
        to be direct with me.   

07:38.558 --> 07:39.790
Well, look what's               
happening.                      

07:39.792 --> 07:41.325
The card said push.             
You're not pushing.             

07:41.327 --> 07:43.494
          Well, I-I don't want  
    to knock you off balance.   

07:43.496 --> 07:45.363
Well, would you                 
push harder if                  
I was white?                    

07:45.365 --> 07:46.797
                        What?   

07:46.799 --> 07:48.799
Well, I mean, you're always     
bending over backwards          
for me.                         

07:48.801 --> 07:50.801
I can't even get into           
a good argument with you,       

07:50.803 --> 07:52.203
you're so quick                 
to agree with me.               

07:52.205 --> 07:53.871
                 Well, Lionel,  
            we're supposed to   
                  be friends.   

07:53.873 --> 07:55.706
Yeah, well, that's why          
I'm telling you this.           

07:55.708 --> 07:57.075
You gonna push?                 

07:57.077 --> 07:59.143
                Fine. I'll push.

07:59.145 --> 08:01.345
Yeah, just once I'd like        
for you to talk to me           

08:01.347 --> 08:02.580
like I was                      
Lionel Jefferson,               

08:02.582 --> 08:04.582
and not a representative        
of the whole black race.        

08:04.584 --> 08:06.917
            Oh, come on, Lionel,
              I don't do that!  

08:06.919 --> 08:09.320
Sure! What's the first thing    
you say whenever I see you?     

08:09.322 --> 08:11.055
Always something about          
the black problem, right?       

08:11.057 --> 08:13.291
      Well, what do you want me 
     to talk about, the weather?

08:13.293 --> 08:14.425
Sometimes, yeah.                

08:14.427 --> 08:16.260
I mean, black people have       
weather too, you know.          

08:16.262 --> 08:18.696
I mean, we get rained on        
and everything.                 

08:18.698 --> 08:20.264
                  Now, look,    
                     Lionel.    
Enough!                         

08:21.666 --> 08:23.134
                I'm sorry.      

08:23.136 --> 08:26.737
         Jeez, you really had me
             faked out there.   
            What an act.        

08:26.739 --> 08:28.339
        But I didn't believe it,
            Lionel. No, sir.    

08:28.341 --> 08:29.873
     I didn't believe           
    one word you said.          

08:29.875 --> 08:31.842
I vote Cop Out.                 
What does everybody             
else say?                       

08:31.844 --> 08:33.244
                FRANK AND IRENE:
            With It. With It.   

08:33.246 --> 08:34.845
        I vote With It.         

08:34.847 --> 08:36.647
How can you--?                  
That's ridiculous!              
You saw the way--               

08:36.649 --> 08:37.648
            Michael, that's four
                  With Its.     

08:37.650 --> 08:39.417
All right, fine.                
Four With Its.                  

08:39.419 --> 08:40.418
    Good. One, two,             
    three, four.                

08:40.419 --> 08:42.620
But I vote Cop Out.             
      One back.                 

08:42.621 --> 08:44.489
I can't believe you             
bought that.                    

08:44.491 --> 08:46.491
Michael, isn't this game great? 
    It's just like you said.    

08:46.493 --> 08:48.025
        You just learned        
     a lot about yourself.      

08:48.027 --> 08:49.793
      Yeah, yeah, Gloria.       
    I learned a whole pile.     

08:49.795 --> 08:51.829
     I learned that Lionel      
 could fake you all out. Fine.  

08:51.831 --> 08:52.930
    Go ahead, Gloria.           

08:52.932 --> 08:54.698
It's your turn.                 
Sheesh.                         

08:54.700 --> 08:56.000
                        Okay.   

08:57.636 --> 09:00.304
    "Pick the person closest    
      in the group to you       

09:00.306 --> 09:02.840
    and tell them something     
you think will help them."      

09:04.109 --> 09:05.643
                         Okay.  

09:07.946 --> 09:09.847
        Ma, I don't want        
    to embarrass you--          

09:09.849 --> 09:11.182
                        Hey, ah,
                         ah, ah.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.784
                 Gloria, uh,    
             what are you doing?

09:13.786 --> 09:15.319
    Talking to Ma.              

09:15.321 --> 09:16.920
                      I know.   
                You should be   
                  talking to me.

09:16.922 --> 09:18.389
            Why?                

09:18.391 --> 09:21.025
The card said, "Pick the person 
 closest in the group to you."  

09:21.027 --> 09:22.460
    That-- That's me,           
         your husband.          

09:22.462 --> 09:23.927
            Michael,            
        don't be silly.         

09:23.929 --> 09:25.463
          You're both           
    very close to me.           

09:25.465 --> 09:27.898
                Gloria, you're  
              missing the point!

09:27.900 --> 09:31.636
              The card says,    
         "Pick the person," see,
         "closest in the group."

09:31.638 --> 09:32.637
  Michael, you're               
  being so picky.               

09:32.639 --> 09:33.837
            Closest! Closest!   

09:33.839 --> 09:37.007
Gloria, Mike,                   
please don't                    
fight over me.                  

09:37.009 --> 09:38.342
                      I'm not   
                fighting, Ma.   

09:38.344 --> 09:40.344
                      I'm just  
                trying to get   
                your daughter   

09:40.346 --> 09:41.945
                     to play    
                 the game right,
                that's all.     

09:41.947 --> 09:43.781
        Michael,                
     don't be ridiculous.       

09:43.783 --> 09:45.216
                I'm not being   
             ridiculous, Gloria.

14:29.769 --> 14:32.202
      that you're smarter       
        than him.               

14:32.204 --> 14:34.271
        Oh, she's               
          got you there.        
                        Zing!   

14:34.273 --> 14:35.372
      Hey, wait a second!       

14:35.374 --> 14:38.075
      Wait a second here!       

14:38.077 --> 14:39.309
    What is with you people?    

14:39.311 --> 14:41.111
What are you                    
all ganging up                  
on me for?!                     

14:41.113 --> 14:42.312
              We're not         
          ganging up on you.    

14:42.314 --> 14:44.114
            Can't you believe   
                    the fact    

14:44.116 --> 14:45.248
                    that she is 
                      right?    

14:45.250 --> 14:46.750
    She's right, huh?           

14:46.752 --> 14:48.418
     All right. All right.      

14:49.921 --> 14:51.622
             Fine.              

14:51.624 --> 14:53.190
I don't want                    
to play anymore.                

15:03.234 --> 15:04.902
         I don't understand you,
                 Michael.       

15:04.904 --> 15:06.937
                 You're the one 
                 that started   
            this whole thing.   

15:06.939 --> 15:09.106
                  You're the one
                  that wanted to
                  play the game.

15:09.108 --> 15:11.274
But, Gloria, they weren't       
    playing that game.          

15:11.276 --> 15:12.643
    They were playing           
        Get Mike Stivic.        

15:12.645 --> 15:14.244
        And you were one        
    of the worst offenders.     

15:14.246 --> 15:15.679
                 Me?            

15:15.681 --> 15:17.481
     Yes, you. "Pick the one    
     that's closest to you."    

15:17.483 --> 15:19.617
Pick your mother, not me.       

15:19.619 --> 15:21.018
      Oh, Michael,              
  don't you understand,         

15:21.020 --> 15:22.019
you can love                    
two people                      

15:22.021 --> 15:24.421
at the same time                
in different ways?              

15:24.423 --> 15:27.057
     Yeah. I understand, Gloria.
      You love your mother more.

15:27.059 --> 15:28.392
I didn't say that!              

15:28.394 --> 15:30.093
                All right.      
            Let's get down to   
                  real basics.  

15:30.095 --> 15:31.161
                Okay, Gloria?   

15:31.163 --> 15:32.663
             There's a storm    
                 at sea.        

15:32.665 --> 15:35.866
             The boat overturns 
        and your mother and I   
            are drowning.       

15:35.868 --> 15:37.434
             Which one of us    
             would you save?    

15:37.436 --> 15:39.336
Oh, Michael, don't pull         
that old one on me--            

15:39.338 --> 15:41.005
              No, just answer   
            the question!       

15:41.007 --> 15:42.439
             Which one of us    
             would you save?    

15:42.441 --> 15:44.808
That is not                     
a fair question.                
                      Why not?  

15:44.810 --> 15:47.110
  Because I can't swim.         

15:48.346 --> 15:50.180
Fine, Gloria. Make jokes.       
        Avoid the issue.        

15:50.182 --> 15:51.314
    That's okay.                

15:51.316 --> 15:52.883
             You know what      
    your problem is, Michael?   

15:52.885 --> 15:54.351
    You can't take criticism.   

15:54.353 --> 15:56.420
        You can dish it out,    
          but you can't take it.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.956
Gloria, I can take criticism    
when it is constructive,        

15:58.958 --> 16:00.624
but that down there             
was persecution!                

16:00.626 --> 16:02.292
Did you hear what               
your mother called me?          

16:02.294 --> 16:03.594
                        What?   
      She called me             
        an idiot.               

16:03.596 --> 16:04.862
             I didn't hear that!

16:04.864 --> 16:06.664
Gloria, she said I wasn't       
as smart as Archie.             

16:06.666 --> 16:08.999
That makes me an idiot.         

16:09.001 --> 16:10.601
                  You listen--  
I don't want to                 
listen anymore                  

16:10.603 --> 16:13.170
Gloria. Leave me alone.         
 GLORIA: Come on, be reasonable.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.872
                 They're still  
                     fighting.  

16:14.874 --> 16:17.240
     I wish we'd never          
     started that game.         

16:17.242 --> 16:19.677
What are you                    
doing, Irene?                   

16:19.679 --> 16:22.212
                Something you   
            ought to try, Edith.

16:22.214 --> 16:25.449
                 It relieves    
             the tension in your
             shoulders and back.

16:25.451 --> 16:29.219
                 You just take  
                 all the bones  
            out of your arms.   

16:29.221 --> 16:30.487
                Come on, try it.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.189
  Oh, all right.                

16:35.359 --> 16:36.827
    Hey, Mrs. Bunker?           

16:36.829 --> 16:37.828
                        EDITH:  
                      Yeah, Li--

16:37.830 --> 16:40.330
Oh! Excuse me.                  

16:40.332 --> 16:42.165
      Uh, Frank can't find      
         the tea bags.          

16:42.167 --> 16:44.735
 Oh, in the right-hand cupboard,
        in the coffee can.      

16:44.737 --> 16:47.404
                  Oh, uh, not in
                  the coffee can

16:47.406 --> 16:49.239
              with the coffee   
                  in it.        

16:49.241 --> 16:52.776
         In the empty coffee can
        with the tea in it.     

16:52.778 --> 16:55.145
          I don't know          
    how we missed it.           

16:56.447 --> 17:00.283
Oh, Mike,                       
I'm so glad                     
you came back down.             

17:00.285 --> 17:02.586
And I'm sorry                   
if I upset you before.          

17:02.588 --> 17:04.088
        No, no. Ma, really,     
             it's all right.    

17:04.089 --> 17:05.623
            It was all          
                my fault.       

17:05.625 --> 17:07.958
Oh hello. Look who's back.      
  You're just in time for tea.  

17:07.960 --> 17:09.326
         I'll get two more cups.

17:09.328 --> 17:10.794
            Uh, uh, Frank,      
         before you do that...  

17:10.796 --> 17:12.395
  would everybody sit down      
    for just one second?        

17:12.396 --> 17:13.998
 I have something               
I want to tell you.             

17:14.000 --> 17:15.198
                      EDITH:    
                  Oh, all right.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.333
    Come on,                    
 everybody sit down.            

17:16.335 --> 17:18.102
Just one minute.                

17:18.104 --> 17:23.741
  Uh...Gloria and I             
had a calm, quiet talk          
upstairs and...                 

17:25.242 --> 17:27.444
I realized that                 
 I behaved stupidly.            

17:27.445 --> 17:28.912
        Oh, no, Mike.           

17:28.914 --> 17:30.514
             No, no, no, Ma.    
        That's the word: stupid.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.350
 I should have been adult enough
      to take the criticism.    

17:33.352 --> 17:35.485
    I just want to say          
        that I apologize        

17:35.487 --> 17:37.254
          and tell you          
        I'm very sorry.         

17:37.256 --> 17:38.689
We understand.                  
                  Mike, come on.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.457
  You don't have                
  to apologize.                 
                 No, really, Ma.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.760
 So you picked on me a little.  
            I mean--            

17:42.762 --> 17:44.061
LIONEL:                         
Hey, Mike.                      

17:44.063 --> 17:46.697
What do you mean, "picked       
on you?"                        
            Did I say "picked"? 

17:46.699 --> 17:48.165
    I-I didn't mean that.       

17:48.167 --> 17:50.467
    What I meant was maybe      
    some of the things you said 

17:50.469 --> 17:51.501
         were a little          
         uncalled for.          

17:51.503 --> 17:52.970
    Well, now, if they were     
         uncalled for,          

17:52.972 --> 17:54.237
        I wouldn't have         
        said 'em.               

17:54.239 --> 17:56.774
  Lionel, why are you jumping   
      on every word I say?      

17:56.776 --> 17:58.408
I didn't mean that either.      

17:58.410 --> 18:00.678
 Forget it! Gee, you can't even 
  make an apology around here.  

18:00.680 --> 18:02.312
                Michael,        
              don't get excited.

18:02.314 --> 18:04.548
                  Haven't you   
            learned anything?   

18:04.550 --> 18:07.051
     Gloria, I tried            
  to apologize, didn't I?       

18:07.053 --> 18:09.987
     Yes, you did, Michael.     
     And you were beautiful.    

18:09.989 --> 18:11.855
Now, come on, everybody.        
Let's have some tea.            

18:11.857 --> 18:13.957
     Irene, but you're missing  
     the whole point completely.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.525
          I admit it,           
         I overreacted.         

18:15.527 --> 18:17.728
        But the point is,       
     anybody would have done    
          the same thing        

18:17.730 --> 18:19.763
        if they had been hit    
         as hard as I was.      

18:19.765 --> 18:21.031
     Will you forget it?        

18:21.033 --> 18:22.700
          Hey, do you admit     
             I was right?       

18:22.702 --> 18:23.834
    Yeah, sure.                 
Have some tea.                  

18:23.836 --> 18:25.803
        Hey, don't              
patronize me, Lionel.           

18:25.805 --> 18:27.237
Michael,                        
please!                         

18:27.239 --> 18:28.271
            Stay out of this,   
                    Gloria.     

18:28.273 --> 18:29.807
                     I'm making 
                a point here.   

18:29.809 --> 18:32.142
             Lionel, I want to  
        see you say something   
              to somebody here  

18:32.144 --> 18:34.578
            that you've never   
                said before but 
              you'd like to say.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.846
Oh, come on.                    
The game's over.                

18:35.848 --> 18:36.880
        Mike, have              
        some tea.               

18:36.882 --> 18:38.082
                I don't want    
                 any tea, Frank.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.316
                 Leave me alone!

18:39.318 --> 18:40.718
          Come on, say something
             to somebody here   

18:40.720 --> 18:41.719
            that you've         
            never said before.  

18:41.721 --> 18:42.720
                Pick somebody.  

18:42.722 --> 18:44.521
             Okay.              

18:46.024 --> 18:48.225
Mrs. Bunker,                    
I have something                
I'd like to say to you.         

18:48.227 --> 18:50.027
                      All right,
                         Lionel.

18:51.229 --> 18:52.629
I don't know                    
how to say this.                

18:52.631 --> 18:54.798
Oh, come on, Lionel.            
Don't cop out.                  

18:54.800 --> 18:57.201
  Mrs. Bunker...                

18:58.803 --> 19:01.171
when we first moved here,       
I was kind of scared.           

19:01.173 --> 19:02.973
My whole family                 
was scared.                     

19:02.975 --> 19:05.308
But because of the way          
you made us feel welcome,       

19:05.310 --> 19:06.543
we knew that                    
no matter what,                 

19:06.545 --> 19:08.946
we had one good friend          
in this neighborhood.           

19:08.948 --> 19:10.547
I don't know why                
it took so long                 

19:10.549 --> 19:12.750
to tell you this,               
but I'm very grateful.          

19:12.752 --> 19:15.886
                  Oh, thank you,
                      Lionel.   

19:17.388 --> 19:20.057
        That's it?              

19:21.860 --> 19:24.228
    You don't have anything     
        more you want to        
          say to her?           

19:24.230 --> 19:25.229
             No.                

19:25.231 --> 19:26.463
                Well, what about
                 the criticism? 

19:26.465 --> 19:27.865
I don't have any.               

19:27.867 --> 19:29.666
                 But criticism  
              is the whole point
                 of this game!  

19:29.668 --> 19:31.468
                  There's no fun
                    without it. 

19:32.804 --> 19:35.773
        Yeah. And so far        
  you've been a barrel of fun.  

19:35.775 --> 19:37.674
      Don't start with me,      
             Frank.             

19:37.676 --> 19:39.743
I'm the only one                
who's opened up                 
 here tonight.                  

19:39.745 --> 19:42.980
All we know about you           
is that you love your nose      
and your pretty chest.          

19:42.982 --> 19:44.381
         Why don't you          
     pick on somebody here?     

19:44.383 --> 19:46.784
    I would, but I can't think  
    of anything I want to say.  

19:46.786 --> 19:48.852
    Nothing? There's nothing    
bottled up inside of you?       

19:48.854 --> 19:51.054
  Nothing you want to say to    
  anybody? Not even your wife?  

19:51.056 --> 19:53.056
  Come on, Frank, you've been   
married for over 20 years!      

19:53.058 --> 19:55.058
    There must be something     
    you want to say to her.     

19:55.060 --> 19:56.426
What about your sex life?       

19:56.428 --> 19:58.228
     Isn't there something      
  you want to say about that?   

19:58.230 --> 20:00.164
Aha! My sex life.               
You bet I have.                 

20:00.166 --> 20:01.564
I'm glad                        
you brought it up.              

20:01.566 --> 20:03.700
Irene, thank you.               

20:10.675 --> 20:13.310
This is ridiculous!             
This is totally                 
ridiculous!                     

20:13.312 --> 20:15.612
    I don't even know           
     why I bother to            
     come down here.            

20:15.614 --> 20:17.014
                Michael,        
            don't cop out       
              by going upstairs.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.381
                  Ho, ho, ho!   

20:18.383 --> 20:20.417
            Don't you talk to me
             about copping out, 
                Gloria.         

20:20.419 --> 20:23.287
I am the only one who has played
    this game honest tonight.   

20:23.289 --> 20:24.421
         That's right.          

20:24.423 --> 20:25.722
              I thought we could
                 get together,  

20:25.724 --> 20:27.224
              have a nice game  
            without Archie here.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.993
            But as it turns out,
            I'm playing the game
             with five Archies, 

20:29.995 --> 20:32.529
                 and every one  
                of you is worse 
              than the real one.

20:32.531 --> 20:35.165
Michael, right now              
you sound worse than            
Daddy ever sounded.             

20:35.167 --> 20:36.800
            How can you say that
            to me, Gloria?      

20:36.802 --> 20:38.601
              You know the way  
            the man talks to me.

20:38.603 --> 20:40.170
             He never even      
              says hello.       

20:40.172 --> 20:43.073
        The first thing out     
    of his mouth is "Get away   
        from me, Meathead."     

20:43.075 --> 20:46.076
Michael, you know               
you yell at Daddy just          
as much as he yells at you.     

20:46.078 --> 20:47.811
         Gloria, it's different.
            It's self-defense.  

20:47.813 --> 20:49.446
                He forces me    
            to yell at him.     

20:49.448 --> 20:53.783
  Mike, I don't think you yell  
  at Archie because of Archie.  

20:53.785 --> 20:56.320
    I think you yell at him     
        because of you--        

20:56.322 --> 20:58.155
                Ma, what are you
                 talking about?!

20:58.157 --> 20:59.556
  Will you let her finish?      

20:59.558 --> 21:01.391
I'd like to hear                
what she has                    
to say.                         

21:01.393 --> 21:02.826
              Yes, but she's not
            making any sense!   

21:02.828 --> 21:04.627
     That's another problem     
         with you, man.         

21:04.629 --> 21:06.196
  You never let anybody talk.   

21:06.198 --> 21:07.931
              Oh. Oh, thank you,
                    Lionel.     

21:07.933 --> 21:09.132
                Thank you. Fine.

21:09.134 --> 21:11.034
                  Is that what  
                everybody wants,
                for her to talk?

21:11.036 --> 21:12.236
                  Okay.         

21:12.238 --> 21:13.971
                All right, Ma.  
                You talk,       
                I'll listen.    

21:13.973 --> 21:15.372
             Go ahead, Ma, talk.

21:15.374 --> 21:21.178
Well...I remember a story       
we learned in school once       

21:21.180 --> 21:24.681
     about a man who saved      
      another man's life.       

21:24.683 --> 21:27.050
    Ma, what has this           
    got to do with anything?    

21:27.052 --> 21:28.752
Oh, Mike, will you              
give her a chance?              

21:28.754 --> 21:30.120
    Would you                   
  let her talk?                 

21:30.122 --> 21:32.722
    Frank, stay out of this now.
Don't you tell me to stay out.  

21:32.724 --> 21:34.157
If I had a son                  
like that--                     

21:34.159 --> 21:35.359
                You've got a son
                like that!      

21:35.361 --> 21:37.427
Yeah, whose fault is it         
that they behave like him?      

21:37.429 --> 21:38.695
             BOTH:              
             Yours!             

21:38.697 --> 21:39.963
GLORIA:                         
Mr. and Mrs. Lorenzo,           

21:39.965 --> 21:41.865
please                          
don't fight.                    

21:41.867 --> 21:43.066
      No, no, Gloria.           
     This is beautiful.         

21:43.068 --> 21:44.834
        Don't stop them.        
     This is the first time     

21:44.836 --> 21:46.436
    some truth is coming out    
     in their relationship.     

21:46.438 --> 21:47.771
Go ahead, kill each other.      

21:49.173 --> 21:50.473
Wait, wait, wait.               

21:50.475 --> 21:52.142
What were you saying            
about saving                    
somebody's life?                

21:52.144 --> 21:55.279
            Yeah, this man saved
            another man's life. 

21:55.281 --> 21:59.049
And the man who was saved,      
instead of being thankful,      

21:59.051 --> 22:01.885
     got madder and madder      
at the man who saved him.       

22:01.887 --> 22:03.887
And the moral of the story--    
         MICHAEL: All right, Ma.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.122
    What you're trying to say   

22:05.124 --> 22:07.557
    is that I resent Archie     
because I owe him so much.      

22:07.559 --> 22:08.959
      Well, I've told him       
        a hundred times         

22:08.961 --> 22:10.760
        I'd pay him back        
with interest, every cent.      

22:10.762 --> 22:11.962
                 Now, excuse me,
                     please.    

22:11.964 --> 22:13.130
        Oh, no, wait.           

22:13.132 --> 22:14.631
            Wait a minute, Mike.
              I ain't finished. 

22:14.633 --> 22:17.534
            There's more to     
            the moral than that.

22:17.536 --> 22:21.238
        Now, the teacher said   
            that what the story 
              really meant was  

22:21.240 --> 22:24.975
        that if you owe somebody
              an awful lot,     

22:24.977 --> 22:28.511
        you begin worrying      
            that you'll never   
        be able to pay 'em back,

22:28.513 --> 22:31.214
             and that makes you 
             resent that person 
                 even more.     

22:31.216 --> 22:34.084
                    You see     
                    what I mean?

22:35.353 --> 22:36.286
I'm going to the kitchen.       

22:37.888 --> 22:40.523
    I think that I'd better     
     have another talk with him.

22:40.525 --> 22:42.426
Oh, no, Gloria.                 
Let me.                         

22:42.428 --> 22:43.726
    Excuse me.                  

22:44.929 --> 22:46.163
             Mike!              

22:46.165 --> 22:47.464
I'm all right,                  
Ma.                             

22:47.466 --> 22:50.900
                  Out there,    
                I told you why  
             you yell at Archie.

22:50.902 --> 22:53.903
            Don't you want to   
                hear why Archie 
                 yells at you?  

22:53.905 --> 22:54.904
    Ma...                       

22:54.906 --> 22:56.406
        I know why              
     he yells at me.            

22:56.408 --> 22:57.707
    He hates me.                

22:57.709 --> 22:59.576
              Oh, no, Mike.     

22:59.578 --> 23:03.013
             Archie yells at you
             'cause he's jealous
                of you.         

23:03.015 --> 23:04.747
            Ma, I don't want    
              to listen to this!

23:04.749 --> 23:06.883
Oh, now, wait a minute.         
You will listen to me!          

23:06.885 --> 23:08.551
Archie is jealous               
of you.                         

23:08.553 --> 23:09.552
                    Oh, come on,
                         Ma.    

23:09.554 --> 23:11.355
Now, that ain't hard            
to understand.                  

23:11.357 --> 23:14.091
Mike, you're                    
going to college                

23:14.093 --> 23:16.393
and you got                     
your whole life                 
ahead of you.                   

23:16.395 --> 23:20.330
Archie had to quit school       
to support his family.          

23:20.332 --> 23:24.301
He ain't never gonna            
be nothing more than            
he is right now.                

23:24.303 --> 23:29.339
But you, you got                
a chance to be anything         
you want to be.                 

23:29.341 --> 23:32.175
That's why Archie's             
jealous of you.                 

23:32.177 --> 23:36.413
He sees in you                  
all the things that             
he could never be.              

23:39.550 --> 23:42.452
So the next time                
Archie yells at you,            

23:42.454 --> 23:46.589
try to be a little              
more understanding.             

23:46.591 --> 23:48.025
  Now, you think                
    that over.                  

23:48.027 --> 23:50.960
     And when you're ready,     
come back in here with us       

23:50.962 --> 23:52.429
        and be with             
        our friends.            

24:00.738 --> 24:02.605
            Keep away from me,  
                Meathead.       

24:05.843 --> 24:08.645
          Oh, are they still    
              all here?         

24:08.647 --> 24:10.013
          Get away from me.     

24:10.015 --> 24:11.714
                     Arch, uh...

24:11.716 --> 24:13.316
                  I want to     
             tell you something.

24:13.318 --> 24:14.851
    Oh, what?                   

24:15.986 --> 24:17.687
                I understand.   

24:46.217 --> 24:50.353
        ANNOUNCER:              
 All in the Family <i>was recorded</i> 
 <i>on tape before a live audience.</i>
