WEBVTT

00:12.500 --> 00:14.767
- MILES, WHILE I'M BAKING,

00:14.767 --> 00:17.233
CAN YOU NOT HOVER
OVER MY SHOULDER?

00:17.233 --> 00:19.000
LITERALLY?

00:19.000 --> 00:23.467
- UGH, YOU SOUND
JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER.

00:24.967 --> 00:26.200
- I AGREED TO HELP MILES
MAKE COOKIES

00:26.200 --> 00:27.767
FOR HIS LITTLE CLUB
GET-TOGETHER.

00:27.767 --> 00:29.400
EXCUSE ME.

00:29.400 --> 00:31.433
THE GHOSTS AGAINST SCARING
ASSOCIATION

00:31.433 --> 00:32.867
IS A HUGE DEAL.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.200
WE MEET EVERY MONTH
TO DISCUSS WAYS

00:34.200 --> 00:36.233
TO PROMOTE POSITIVE
GHOST MESSAGING.

00:36.233 --> 00:41.400
- I MAY HAVE MISLED YOU WITH MY
"HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?"

00:41.400 --> 00:42.833
I JUST WANT A COOKIE.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.867
- ALL RIGHT.

00:44.867 --> 00:48.333
THEY SHOULD BE READY
IN ABOUT...TEN MINUTES.

00:48.333 --> 00:50.367
I JUST HAVE
TO SET THE TIMER TO...

00:52.567 --> 00:54.000
NOT THAT.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.267
- IT'S BROKEN.
MOM'S GOING TO FREAK.

00:56.267 --> 00:58.667
DON'T WORRY,
I'VE GOT YOUR BACK.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.400
- WHAT A NIGHTMARE!

01:02.400 --> 01:03.933
- SHE DID IT.

01:03.933 --> 01:05.633
- I CAN'T FIND
MY LIPSTICK ANYWHERE.

01:05.633 --> 01:09.300
OH, THERE IT IS.

01:09.300 --> 01:12.733
THANKS, LITTLE ONES.
LOVE YA BUNCHES.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.067
UH, MOM?

01:22.067 --> 01:24.500
I THINK THE OVEN IS BROKEN.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.067
- OOH, SOUNDS FUN.

01:28.067 --> 01:30.900
DOES MY HAIR LOOK OKAY?
I THINK IT LOOKS OKAY.

01:32.633 --> 01:36.233
UGH!

01:36.233 --> 01:39.900
MY SNACKS!
I CAN'T SERVE THESE NOW!

01:39.900 --> 01:43.600
- ALL RIGHT,
I NEED ANSWERS!

01:43.600 --> 01:47.100
I ASKED HOW MY HAIR WAS,
AND NO ONE'S RESPONDED.

01:47.100 --> 01:48.533
YOU KNOW--OOH!
KNOW WHAT?

01:48.533 --> 01:50.267
NO TIME.
I'VE GOT, UH...

01:50.267 --> 01:53.367
SOMETHING TO DO.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.067
- WAIT A SEC.

01:56.067 --> 02:00.233
ACTING NERVOUS,
EASILY DISTRACTED,

02:00.233 --> 02:03.233
OVERLY CONCERNED
ABOUT HER LOOKS.

02:03.233 --> 02:05.067
I THINK MOM
IS GOING ON A DATE.

02:05.067 --> 02:06.767
IMPOSSIBLE!

02:06.767 --> 02:08.867
- FRANKIE,
IT'S FRIDAY AFTERNOON

02:08.867 --> 02:12.133
AND SHE'S
NOT WEARING SWEATPANTS.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.133
- MOM'S GOING ON A DATE!

02:14.133 --> 02:16.267
WITH THAT HAIRDO?

02:16.267 --> 02:19.700
YIKES.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.500
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

02:25.500 --> 02:28.200
* YOU'VE GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

02:28.200 --> 02:30.867
- * SO IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

02:30.867 --> 02:34.067
* YOU GOTTA BE ONE BIG
SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

02:34.067 --> 02:36.533
- * DON'T KNOW HOW
WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

02:36.533 --> 02:40.067
* BUT I GUESS YOU COULD CALL US
THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS *

02:40.067 --> 02:41.100
- * OOH, OOH, OOH

02:41.100 --> 02:42.867
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:42.867 --> 02:43.967
- * OOH, OOH, OOH

02:43.967 --> 02:46.567
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:46.567 --> 02:49.567
**

02:49.567 --> 02:57.800
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:57.800 --> 03:00.067
- IT'S A CRAZY WORLD
OUT THERE.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.200
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.467
- MOM...

03:06.467 --> 03:09.533
THIS OVEN REPAIR GUY CAN'T
GET OUT HERE UNTIL NEXT WEEK.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.467
- AWW, THANK YOU.

03:11.467 --> 03:14.067
I GOT IT ON SALE.
40 BUCKS.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.467
- HEY, IF YOU WANT
YOUR OVEN REPAIRED,

03:17.467 --> 03:19.167
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST ASK MY POPS?

03:19.167 --> 03:21.067
RAY, YOU CAN FIX IT?

03:21.067 --> 03:23.400
- MY DAD CAN FIX ANYTHING.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.733
WELL, NOT ANYTHING.

03:25.733 --> 03:28.133
- HE'S JUST BEING MODEST.
- THAT'S TRUE.

03:28.133 --> 03:30.233
- LAST YEAR ALONE,
HE FIXED THE FURNACE,

03:30.233 --> 03:31.467
THE VACUUM CLEANER,

03:31.467 --> 03:33.700
AND MY TWEEN DREAM
VANITY MIRROR.

03:35.067 --> 03:38.600
MILES' TWEEN DREAM
VANITY MIRROR.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.933
- PRESTON MEN DO KNOW
THEIR WAY AROUND A TOOLBOX.

03:41.933 --> 03:43.467
- YEAH, THEY DO.
THE MAN!

03:43.467 --> 03:46.867
LET'S GO TAKE A LOOK.

03:46.867 --> 03:48.700
- THANKS, RAY!

03:50.800 --> 03:52.433
PRINCIPAL NELSON?

03:52.433 --> 03:54.333
- MS. HATHAWAY.

04:00.267 --> 04:01.600
- I DON'T KNOW.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.067
- YOU DON'T THINK
HE FOUND OUT

04:03.067 --> 04:04.333
I BOOBY-TRAPPED
THE WATER FOUNTAIN.

04:04.333 --> 04:06.400
OR COATED THE GYM ROPES
WITH BUTTER!

04:06.400 --> 04:08.967
OR FILLED THE TROMBONES
WITH TACO MEAT!

04:10.500 --> 04:14.367
- MESS WITH ME
AND YOU'LL FIND OUT.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.867
- WHY IS MOM TALKING
TO OUR PRINCIPAL?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.300
MILES!

04:24.567 --> 04:26.067
I'M KINDA BUSY
MAKING GHOST T-SHIRTS

04:26.067 --> 04:27.333
FOR MY CLUB MEETING.

04:27.333 --> 04:29.600
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT
I SHOULD OFFER SOMETHING

04:29.600 --> 04:32.100
SINCE I HAVE NO SNACKS.

04:32.100 --> 04:35.600
- "STOP SCARING,
START CARING"?

04:37.667 --> 04:40.067
- WE NEED YOU TO STRETCH
YOUR EAR OVER THERE

04:40.067 --> 04:41.200
AND EAVESDROP ON OUR MOM.

04:41.200 --> 04:42.500
- I GUESS I COULD DO THAT.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.667
JUST AS LONG
AS IT'S NOT HAUNTING.

04:44.667 --> 04:46.200
AFTER ALL...

04:46.200 --> 04:48.600
- LESS TALKY, MORE STRETCHY.

04:53.400 --> 04:55.200
- OKAY, LET'S SEE.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.867
HE'S COMPLIMENTING HER
A LOT.

04:57.867 --> 04:59.900
NO WAY!

04:59.900 --> 05:03.833
- DID YOU KNOW MICHELLE
GOT THAT BLOUSE FOR 40 BUCKS?

05:03.833 --> 05:07.333
WHAT A FIND.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.767
NOW SHE'S GIGGLING.

05:08.767 --> 05:12.300
- NOW HE'S GIGGLING.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.333
- NOW THEY'RE
MAKING DINNER PLANS.

05:16.533 --> 05:19.533
I THINK WE SEE
WHERE THIS IS GOING.

05:19.533 --> 05:21.467
TO A RESTAURANT.

05:21.467 --> 05:25.300
- NO, MOM IS DATING
OUR PRINCIPAL!

05:26.433 --> 05:27.767
- AWW.

05:27.767 --> 05:30.200
- NOT "AWW!"
EWW!

05:30.200 --> 05:31.500
- UH-HUH.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.733
- OHH.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.400
- OKAY, POPS, LET'S SHOW
THESE HATHAWAY WOMEN

05:38.400 --> 05:41.067
WHAT A PRESTON MAN CAN DO.

05:41.067 --> 05:42.733
SO...

05:42.733 --> 05:44.333
WHAT DO WE DO?

05:44.333 --> 05:47.067
- WELL, THE FIRST THING
WHEN FIXING AN APPLIANCE

05:47.067 --> 05:48.500
IS LOOKING THE PART.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.233
HA!

05:50.233 --> 05:52.233
CAN'T FORGET MY TOOLS!

05:52.233 --> 05:54.433
- WHOA.
CHECK OUT THAT DRILL.

05:54.433 --> 05:56.767
- OH, YEAH.
SHE'S A BEAUT.

05:56.767 --> 06:00.067
THE S-60-320 X...

06:00.067 --> 06:01.800
60.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.367
LET'S FIRE THIS BABY UP.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.700
- MAYBE MOVE
THAT SAFETY SWITCH.

06:10.833 --> 06:13.333
YOU SEE? I JUST TAUGHT YOU
YOUR FIRST LESSON.

06:13.333 --> 06:17.333
ALWAYS KEEP YOUR DRILL
IN THE SAFETY POSITION.

06:17.333 --> 06:20.933
- YOU ARE THE WISEST MAN
I KNOW.

06:20.933 --> 06:22.433
THANK YOU, SON.

06:22.433 --> 06:24.100
YOU KNOW, I BEEN
DOING THIS SINCE I WAS...

06:24.100 --> 06:26.333
OH!

06:26.333 --> 06:29.733
UH...HA!
RIGHT WHERE I WANTED IT.

06:29.733 --> 06:32.167
YOU KNOW, OUT OF THE REACH
OF CHILDREN.

06:32.167 --> 06:34.667
- SO, SHOULD WE
OPEN THE OVEN

06:34.667 --> 06:36.367
AND SEE WHERE THE NOISE
IS COMING FROM?

06:36.367 --> 06:40.533
- NOW YOU SEE,
THAT'S WHAT A ROOKIE MIGHT DO.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.067
THE FIRST THING A PRO DOES

06:42.067 --> 06:46.367
IS GET THE DIMENSIONS
OF WHAT HE'S FIXING.

06:47.933 --> 06:50.233
GIMME A SEC.
MUST BE JAMMED.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.467
- OW!

06:53.467 --> 06:55.267
- SORRY.

06:55.267 --> 06:57.367
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:57.367 --> 07:00.267
PSHH. THIS LOOKS
LIKE A TRICKY JOB.

07:00.267 --> 07:03.133
MAYBE YOU SHOULD GO UPSTAIRS
AND START YOUR GHOST HOMEWORK.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.567
I HAVE TO LEARN THESE THINGS

07:05.567 --> 07:08.567
IF I WANT
TO BE A MAN SOMEDAY.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.867
I'LL BE YOUR ASSISTANT.

07:09.867 --> 07:13.067
AND LIKE YOU SAID,
I SHOULD LOOK THE PART.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.600
NO ONE BETTER TOUCH
ME POT OF GOLD.

07:23.600 --> 07:26.100
- MOM AND PRINCIPAL NELSON--
DATING!

07:26.100 --> 07:27.333
- I KNOW!

07:27.333 --> 07:29.700
I MEAN, MOM
AND PRINCIPAL NELSON--

07:29.700 --> 07:30.767
DATING!

07:30.767 --> 07:33.067
- I KNOW!

07:33.067 --> 07:34.467
- IS THIS A GOOD TIME

07:34.467 --> 07:37.067
TO RUN SOME ANTI-SCARING
SLOGANS BY YOU GUYS?

07:37.067 --> 07:38.533
both: NO!

07:38.533 --> 07:39.767
- YOU TWO STILL WORRIED

07:39.767 --> 07:41.067
ABOUT MICHELLE
AND YOUR PRINCIPAL?

07:41.067 --> 07:42.900
IS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

07:42.900 --> 07:45.700
both: UM, YEAH!

07:45.700 --> 07:48.300
- WHAT IF IT GOT SERIOUS
AND THEY GOT MARRIED?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.500
- CAN YOU IMAGINE
IF PRINCIPAL NELSON

07:50.500 --> 07:52.233
LIVED UNDER OUR ROOF?

07:52.233 --> 07:54.533
HE'D UNCOVER ALL MY SECRETS.

07:54.533 --> 07:58.400
WHAT IF HE WAS ABLE
TO OPEN MY FOOTLOCKER?

07:58.400 --> 08:00.900
- WHAT DO YOU HAVE
IN YOUR FOOTLOCKER?

08:01.967 --> 08:06.300
- I GOT THINGS, MAN.
BAD THINGS.

08:07.500 --> 08:09.867
IF HE LIVED HERE,
IT WOULD BE A NIGHTMARE.

08:12.933 --> 08:14.833
HELLO?

08:14.833 --> 08:16.133
ANYONE HERE?

08:17.367 --> 08:21.300
- FRANKIE HATHAWAY,
COME ON DOWN!

08:21.300 --> 08:27.133
YOU'RE THE NEXT CONTESTANT
ON "WHEEL OF PUNISHMENT"!

08:29.067 --> 08:32.067
- I KNOW ABOUT THE GYM ROPES
AND YOUR FOOTLOCKER.

08:32.067 --> 08:35.633
AND NOW,
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO PAY!

08:35.633 --> 08:38.200
MICHELLE, ARE YOU READY
TO SPIN THAT WHEEL?

08:38.200 --> 08:40.367
- I SURE AM, BOB.

08:42.267 --> 08:43.600
- ROUND AND ROUND IT GOES.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.967
WHERE IT STOPS,
NOBODY KNOWS.

08:45.967 --> 08:48.467
TRASH DUTY, GROUNDING,

08:48.467 --> 08:50.133
MILITARY SCHOOL?

08:50.133 --> 08:51.367
- NOOO!

08:54.600 --> 08:57.167
- THAT COULD SO HAPPEN.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.767
NO ONE WANTS TO BE FRIENDS

08:59.767 --> 09:01.300
WITH THE DAUGHTER
OF THE PRINCIPAL.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.433
I'D BE A COMPLETE
SOCIAL OUTCAST!

09:06.900 --> 09:09.067
WOULD YOU GO TO THE DANCE
WITH ME?

09:09.067 --> 09:12.800
HI, WOULD YOU
GO TO THE DANCE WITH ME?

09:12.800 --> 09:14.133
WOULD YOU GO TO THE DANCE
WITH ME?

09:14.133 --> 09:16.100
- WITH THE PRINCIPAL'S
DAUGHTER?

09:19.067 --> 09:22.533
- HEY, TAYLOR, YOU CAN
GO TO THE DANCE WITH ME...

09:22.533 --> 09:23.533
AS A CHAPERONE.

09:23.533 --> 09:24.800
IT'LL BE FUN.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.200
WE CAN BUST TROUBLEMAKERS
TOGETHER.

09:28.667 --> 09:32.233
* 'CAUSE WHEN YOU
SNEAK OUT OF SCHOOL *

09:32.233 --> 09:34.567
* OR YOU BREAK THE GOLDEN RULE,
THAT'S DETENTION *

09:34.567 --> 09:35.933
SHAKE IT TO THE LEFT.

09:35.933 --> 09:37.333
* AND WHEN YOU
SNEAK OUT OF CLASS *

09:37.333 --> 09:38.533
* OR GET CAUGHT
WITHOUT A PASS *

09:38.533 --> 09:40.233
* THAT'S DETENTION *

09:40.233 --> 09:42.267
SHAKE IT TO THE RIGHT.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.567
NOOO!

09:48.267 --> 09:50.767
THAT COULD SO HAPPEN.

09:50.767 --> 09:53.567
- ALL I KNOW IS WE
HAVE TO BREAK THEM UP.

09:53.567 --> 09:56.067
I'M GONNA CALL MY SNAKE GUY.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.700
- YEAH, LET'S
CALL THAT OPTION TWO.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.533
NO OFFENSE,
BUT THIS INVOLVES DATING,

10:03.533 --> 10:06.867
AND THAT'S KINDA
MY AREA OF EXPERTISE.

10:09.833 --> 10:11.667
- YES.

10:11.667 --> 10:14.733
- GUYS, WHAT ABOUT
TAKING THE HONEST APPROACH?

10:14.733 --> 10:16.467
GO TALK TO MICHELLE
AND TELL HER

10:16.467 --> 10:18.233
HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING.

10:21.033 --> 10:23.033
"HOW ABOUT
THE HONEST APPROACH?"

10:23.033 --> 10:26.367
"TELL HER
HOW YOU'RE REALLY FEELING."

10:27.367 --> 10:29.767
- TEASING ISN'T PLEASING!

10:29.767 --> 10:32.867
OOH, THAT'S
SO GONNA BE A T-SHIRT.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.600
- AND...

10:35.600 --> 10:38.067
DONE!
WHOO!

10:38.067 --> 10:39.600
I TOLD YOU
I'D GET THE DIGITAL CLOCK

10:39.600 --> 10:42.033
TO TELL
THE RIGHT TIME AGAIN.

10:42.033 --> 10:45.067
- YAY.

10:45.067 --> 10:48.267
SO, DAD, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD OPEN THE OVEN

10:48.267 --> 10:50.333
AND SEE WHERE THE NOISE
IS COMING FROM.

10:50.333 --> 10:53.600
OKAY. FINE.

10:53.600 --> 10:56.533
HAND ME THE GRIPPY THINGY.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.800
- UH, YEAH.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.933
I WASN'T SURE YOU KNEW
THE TECHNICAL NAME FOR IT.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.733
- HEY, CAT, I WOULDN'T
BE SITTING UP THERE

11:07.733 --> 11:09.200
RIGHT NOW IF I WERE YOU.

11:10.733 --> 11:13.200
- OWW!

11:13.200 --> 11:14.433
SERIOUSLY?

11:16.200 --> 11:19.700
- AND THAT, SON, IS HOW
YOU REMOVE AN OVEN DOOR.

11:22.767 --> 11:23.967
- SO I THINK I FOUND A WAY

11:23.967 --> 11:25.467
TO BREAK UP
MOM AND PRINCIPAL NELSON

11:25.467 --> 11:28.967
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SNAKES.

11:28.967 --> 11:31.400
- CHECK OUT THE POSTER I MADE
FOR MY MEETING TONIGHT.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.967
"UNCLE MILES WANTS YOU...

11:34.967 --> 11:36.900
NOT TO BOO!"

11:38.633 --> 11:40.233
- SO I THINK I FOUND A WAY
TO BREAK UP MOM

11:40.233 --> 11:42.933
AND PRINCIPAL NELSON
THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE SNAKES.

11:42.933 --> 11:45.967
WE NEED TO SHOW MOM THERE
ARE BETTER FISH IN THE SEA.

11:45.967 --> 11:49.067
AND THERE HE IS.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.567
- RUSTY,
OUR SCHOOL CROSSING GUARD?

11:53.533 --> 11:56.367
- I DIDN'T HAVE
A TON OF OPTIONS.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.800
- TAYLOR, I'M GOING OUT
FOR A BIT,

11:57.800 --> 11:59.600
SO YOU'RE IN CHARGE, OKAY?
- MOM, WAIT!

11:59.600 --> 12:01.467
YOU REMEMBER RUSTY...

12:01.467 --> 12:03.967
FROM THE BUSY INTERSECTION.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.067
- YES, RUSTY.
THIS IS MY MOTHER.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.300
- OH. HMM.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.333
- WELL, SHE'S NOT A BLONDE.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.067
I'M OUTTA HERE.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.467
- GIRLS, I...

12:19.467 --> 12:23.233
DO NOT KNOW WHAT THAT WAS,
BUT I'M IN A HURRY.

12:25.067 --> 12:27.133
- ACTUALLY, I'M HAVING DINNER
WITH BOB NELSON,

12:27.133 --> 12:28.300
YOUR PRINCIPAL.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.433
I AM SHOCKED
BY THIS NEW INFORMATION.

12:31.433 --> 12:34.133
- WELL, I DIDN'T WANT
TO TELL YOU YET BECAUSE...

12:34.133 --> 12:36.967
THERE'S A CHANCE HE MAY
ASK ME SOMETHING TONIGHT

12:36.967 --> 12:38.933
THAT COULD LEAD
TO AN EXCITING NEW ADVENTURE.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.367
BUT UNTIL IT'S OFFICIAL--
WHOOP!

12:40.367 --> 12:42.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'VE ALREADY SAID TOO MUCH.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.900
WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER!

12:44.900 --> 12:47.067
- OUR NIGHTMARE
IS COMING TRUE.

12:47.067 --> 12:49.600
NELSON'S
GONNA PROPOSE TO MOM!

12:49.600 --> 12:51.067
- I THINK THE TIME HAS COME

12:51.067 --> 12:53.467
TO FINALLY
TAKE SOMEONE'S ADVICE.

12:53.467 --> 12:54.700
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MILES.

12:54.700 --> 12:56.833
FRANKIE,
CALL YOUR SNAKE GUY.

12:56.833 --> 12:59.067
THIS MARRIAGE PROPOSAL
IS NOT HAPPENING.

12:59.067 --> 13:01.233
- OKAY.

13:10.067 --> 13:12.567
- HOW RELAXING
IS THE KOI POND?

13:12.567 --> 13:15.400
FISH ARE SUCH
MAGICAL CREATURES.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.867
I'LL HAVE THE BAKED SALMON.

13:17.867 --> 13:20.200
- I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE
TO GO SOMEWHERE SPECIAL,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.133
IN CASE WE HAVE SOMETHING
TO CELEBRATE.

13:22.133 --> 13:23.967
- WELL, I LIKE IT.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.933
- KONICHIWA.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.733
I'M PATRICIA APPLEBEE,

13:30.733 --> 13:33.600
A GROWN WOMAN
WHO ENJOYS FINE DINING.

13:33.600 --> 13:37.400
- TERRIFIC.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.200
- SILLY FOOL.
HE NEVER SUSPECTED A THING.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.733
- LOOK, THERE THEY ARE.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.067
NO SIGN OF A RING.

13:52.067 --> 13:53.967
YOU READY TO STOP
A WEDDING PROPOSAL?

13:53.967 --> 13:56.700
- JUST PUT THESE SNAKES
UNDER HER TABLE,

13:56.700 --> 13:58.767
AND THIS DATE IS OVER.

14:04.500 --> 14:06.767
- NOW, BECAUSE OF ME,

14:06.767 --> 14:08.067
THEY INSTALLED
AN EXTRA GUARD RAIL

14:08.067 --> 14:09.833
AT THE MONKEY CAGES!

14:11.267 --> 14:14.067
THAT IS A GREAT STORY.
YOU ARE FUNNY.

14:14.067 --> 14:16.367
- OH, I HAVEN'T LAUGHED
THIS HARD IN YEARS.

14:16.367 --> 14:17.433
- WELL...

14:17.433 --> 14:19.467
- COME ON!
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.400
RELEASE THE SERPENTS.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.867
- LOOK AT HER LAUGHING.

14:24.867 --> 14:26.300
SHE LOOKS SO HAPPY.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.900
ARE WE SURE
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING?

14:27.900 --> 14:30.233
- I KNEW YOU'D GO SOFT ON ME.

14:30.233 --> 14:33.233
HERE.

14:33.233 --> 14:35.800
HOLD MY BINKY.

14:38.967 --> 14:41.267
- I LOVED NEW YORK,

14:41.267 --> 14:42.900
BUT MY FAMILY
NEEDED A FRESH START.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.767
IT WAS TOUGH AT FIRST,

14:44.767 --> 14:46.567
BUT IT WAS THE BEST THING
FOR MY GIRLS.

14:46.567 --> 14:49.467
THEY'RE MY BABIES.
- MM.

14:49.467 --> 14:53.133
- UGH! WHY DOES SHE
HAVE TO BE SUCH A GOOD MOM?

14:53.133 --> 14:55.067
- FACE IT.
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

14:55.067 --> 14:56.667
WE BOTH WANT MOM TO BE HAPPY.

14:56.667 --> 14:58.767
AND IF IT'S WITH OUR...

14:58.767 --> 15:02.333
PRINCIPAL, SO BE IT.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.133
COME ON,
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.

15:04.133 --> 15:06.933
- YOU KNOW,
WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

15:06.933 --> 15:10.967
WE'RE VERY CARING PEOPLE.

15:15.600 --> 15:17.867
- UMM...

15:25.567 --> 15:28.067
FOUND 'EM!

15:30.333 --> 15:34.733
- FIT, YOU STUPID PIPE! FIT!

15:35.633 --> 15:37.100
- HELLO, KIND SIR.

15:37.100 --> 15:38.967
'TIS I,
BEN FRANKLIN,

15:38.967 --> 15:43.867
INVENTOR OF THE OVEN
AND LIGHTNING.

15:43.867 --> 15:45.267
- LOUIE...

15:45.267 --> 15:48.267
- AND AS PRESIDENT
OF THESE UNITED STATES,

15:48.267 --> 15:51.800
I DECLARE THIS OVEN
UNFIXABLE.

15:51.800 --> 15:54.067
PLEASE STOP
WASTING EVERYONE'S TIME

15:54.067 --> 15:55.600
AND JUST BUY A NEW ONE.

15:55.600 --> 15:58.067
LATER, DAD.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.833
HEY, POPS.
HA.

15:59.833 --> 16:03.067
ANY COOL VISITORS DROP BY?

16:04.100 --> 16:06.667
- LOUIE,
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

16:06.667 --> 16:08.367
NO ONE'S BUYING A NEW OVEN.

16:08.367 --> 16:12.467
IT'S JUST THIS LINE.
IT NEEDS TIGHTENING.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.267
WHAT'D YOU DO?

16:26.067 --> 16:27.367
- WELCOME, FRIENDS.

16:27.367 --> 16:29.367
I MUST SAY,
THIS IS THE BIGGEST TURNOUT

16:29.367 --> 16:31.933
WE'VE EVER HAD
IN CLUB HISTORY.

16:31.933 --> 16:33.300
WHOO-HOO!

16:35.100 --> 16:38.100
SOME OLIVES, MIXED NUTS?

16:38.100 --> 16:41.333
HOW HARD IS IT TO WHIP UP
A FEW CHEESE PUFFS?

16:41.333 --> 16:44.067
- SNACKS ASIDE,
THE REASON WE'RE HERE

16:44.067 --> 16:45.933
IS OUR COMMITMENT
TO NOT SCARING.

16:45.933 --> 16:48.333
JUST TODAY,
I WAS ASKED TO HAUNT.

16:48.333 --> 16:52.933
- YOU CUT UP AN APPLE
AND PUT IT ON A PLATE!

16:52.933 --> 16:54.933
- THE FAMILY I LIVE WITH
WANTED TO KEEP A MAN

16:54.933 --> 16:56.767
FROM PROPOSING TO THEIR MOM.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.533
BUT I DID THE RIGHT THING:
NOTHING.

16:59.533 --> 17:02.700
- SO WHERE ARE THEY GOING
TO LIVE ONCE THEY'RE ENGAGED?

17:02.700 --> 17:05.233
- THEY'RE GETTING MARRIED.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.500
THEY'LL PROBABLY
MOVE INTO A NEW HOUSE.

17:07.500 --> 17:10.100
- NOBODY IS MOVING.
WHO SAID ANYTHING ABOUT MOVING?

17:10.100 --> 17:11.567
WE'RE A FAMILY!

17:11.567 --> 17:12.600
- RELAX, MAN.

17:12.600 --> 17:14.267
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT
CALM YOU DOWN?

17:14.267 --> 17:15.267
A SNACK.

17:15.267 --> 17:18.300
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.167
- OH, NO.
WHAT HAVE I DONE?

17:20.167 --> 17:24.100
I HAVE TO GET MY HAUNT ON!
MEETING OVER!

17:24.100 --> 17:26.633
- WORST HOST EVER.

17:29.767 --> 17:32.933
GOOD LITTLE SNAKEY.

17:32.933 --> 17:34.767
COME TO MAMA.

17:34.767 --> 17:38.300
- FRANKIE, WE'RE UNDERCOVER.
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.

17:38.300 --> 17:40.067
- OKAY.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.333
- AAH!

17:41.333 --> 17:43.067
- SORRY I'M LATE,
BUT DON'T WORRY.

17:43.067 --> 17:44.633
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET THIS PRINCIPAL CLOWN

17:44.633 --> 17:46.400
TAKE YOU AWAY FROM US.

17:46.400 --> 17:49.533
- MILES, STAND DOWN.
WE'RE NOT--

17:49.533 --> 17:52.500
- SO ANYWAY, I THINK YOU KNOW
WHY I ASKED YOU HERE.

17:52.500 --> 17:56.067
- YO! BOB-O!

17:56.067 --> 17:57.733
PARK IT IN NEUTRAL,
BIG GUY.

17:59.133 --> 18:00.733
- SOMETHING YOU SHOULD KNOW
BEFORE YOU START

18:00.733 --> 18:02.433
ASKING QUESTIONS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

18:02.433 --> 18:03.600
- O-KAY.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.100
- FIRST OFF,
YOU KNOW WHAT MY NICKNAME IS?

18:07.100 --> 18:08.533
MOUSTACHE MICHELLE.

18:08.533 --> 18:11.800
I HAVE TO SHAVE MY FACE
FIVE TIMES A DAY.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.200
- THAT'S A LOT.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.067
- IN FACT,
I FEEL A LITTLE STUBBLE

18:15.067 --> 18:16.400
POPPING OUT RIGHT NOW.

18:16.400 --> 18:19.933
SO, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
GOTTA LATHER UP.

18:23.567 --> 18:26.867
- MICHELLE,
DO YOU NEED SOME FRESH AIR?

18:26.867 --> 18:29.133
- NO, I JUST NEED A RAZOR.

18:29.133 --> 18:32.400
HEY, YO-YO MA!

18:32.400 --> 18:34.167
HELP A LADY OUT!

18:37.133 --> 18:40.233
MM. SMOOTH.

18:42.233 --> 18:43.767
SNAKE!

18:52.800 --> 18:55.300
- IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

18:59.733 --> 19:01.800
- NO NEED TO THANK ME.

19:01.800 --> 19:04.300
UNLESS YOU INSIST.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.867
ARE YOU THREE BEHIND...
THIS?

19:10.867 --> 19:12.500
- WE DID WHAT WE HAD TO DO.

19:12.500 --> 19:15.200
WE COULDN'T SIT BACK
AND LET NELSON MARRY YOU.

19:15.200 --> 19:17.733
- YOU THINK PRINCIPAL NELSON
AND I ARE DATING?

19:17.733 --> 19:19.200
- MOM, WE KNOW.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.067
WE SAW THE GIGGLING,
THE PRIMPING,

19:21.067 --> 19:22.900
THE NOT-WEARING SWEATPANTS.

19:22.900 --> 19:24.600
AT FIRST, WE FREAKED,

19:24.600 --> 19:27.100
BUT THEN WE SAW
HOW HAPPY HE MAKES YOU.

19:27.100 --> 19:29.800
- SO IF YOU WANT TO MARRY HIM,
WE SUPPORT YOU.

19:29.800 --> 19:32.300
- OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
PRINCIPAL NELSON AND I

19:32.300 --> 19:33.500
ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.067
WE'RE NOT EVEN DATING.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.467
- HE'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET ME TO CATER

19:39.467 --> 19:41.467
ALL THE PTA LUNCHEONS
FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR.

19:41.467 --> 19:43.533
WE'VE BEEN
NEGOTIATING A PRICE.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.067
- BUT YOU SAID
THIS COULD BE THE BEGINNING

19:45.067 --> 19:47.233
OF AN EXCITING
NEW ADVENTURE.

19:47.233 --> 19:48.767
- MM-HMM, BECAUSE
I WAS GOING TO USE THE MONEY

19:48.767 --> 19:51.567
TO PAY FOR THAT SKI TRIP
YOU'VE BOTH BEEN DYING TO GO ON.

19:51.567 --> 19:52.833
MM.

19:52.833 --> 19:54.167
- I JUST HAUNTED...

19:54.167 --> 19:56.167
ON NATIONAL
ANTI-HAUNTING DAY...

19:56.167 --> 19:58.333
FOR NOTHING?

19:58.333 --> 20:01.233
- YOU KIDS SHOULD HAVE
JUST USED THE HONEST APPROACH--

20:01.233 --> 20:03.733
COME AND TALK TO ME AND TELL ME
HOW YOU REALLY FEEL.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.100
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MOM.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.533
- IF ONLY SOMEONE
HAD TOLD US.

20:07.533 --> 20:10.200
THAT WAS MY ADVICE.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.467
I SAID THAT!

20:11.467 --> 20:13.167
- WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER

20:13.167 --> 20:15.567
YOU COVERED MY FACE
WITH SOUR CREAM?

20:15.567 --> 20:18.167
- BEFORE.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.700
- SO ABOUT THAT SKI TRIP...

20:20.700 --> 20:24.067
SNAKE!

20:25.267 --> 20:32.567
- YEAH,
YOU'RE NOT GOING SKIING.

20:32.567 --> 20:35.200
- POPS, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

20:35.200 --> 20:38.533
I'M JUST ABOUT DONE IN THERE.

20:38.533 --> 20:40.133
- YEAH, I'VE BEEN
WATCHING YOU ALL DAY.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.333
I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.467
IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

20:45.467 --> 20:47.733
WELL, FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

20:47.733 --> 20:49.067
THE OVEN IS FIXED.

20:49.067 --> 20:50.467
I'M THE MAN, RIGHT?

20:50.467 --> 20:52.533
OKAY, GOOD TALK.
GET LOST, GO PLAY.

20:52.533 --> 20:55.433
- OKAY, MRS. HATHAWAY,
YOUR NEW OVEN IS INSTALLED!

20:55.433 --> 20:57.100
OKAY, THANK YOU!

20:57.100 --> 20:59.067
MONEY'S ON THE COUNTER!

21:00.533 --> 21:04.300
BUT YOU JUST SAID
YOU COULD FIX ANYTHING.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.600
FINE.

21:06.600 --> 21:09.200
THE TRUTH IS...

21:09.200 --> 21:11.167
EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT
I FIXED BEFORE,

21:11.167 --> 21:13.067
I JUST REPLACED.

21:13.067 --> 21:15.600
I BARELY KNOW
A SCREWDRIVER FROM A...

21:15.600 --> 21:16.767
FROM A...

21:16.767 --> 21:18.700
- IT'S CALLED A HAMMER.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.167
- THAT'S IT.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.067
I'M SORRY
I LIED TO YOU, SON.

21:22.067 --> 21:24.267
I JUST DIDN'T
WANT TO LET YOU DOWN.

21:24.267 --> 21:28.067
- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
THIS IS AWESOME!

21:29.633 --> 21:32.233
- I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
IN OUR FAMILY WHO MESSES UP.

21:32.233 --> 21:34.767
EVERY TIME I TURN MYSELF
INTO A LEPRECHAUN

21:34.767 --> 21:37.633
OR A PIECE OF STRING CHEESE,
IT'S HUMILIATING.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.833
BUT NOW THAT I KNOW
YOU'RE A COMPLETE DISASTER

21:39.833 --> 21:41.367
AT FIXING STUFF,

21:41.367 --> 21:43.800
I FEEL LIKE IT'S OKAY
THAT I'M NOT PERFECT.

21:43.800 --> 21:47.767
DAD, YOU'RE THE MAN!

21:49.867 --> 21:51.233
THANK YOU, SON.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.733
I AM THE MAN.

21:54.833 --> 21:56.967
- FORGOT YOUR RECEIPT.

21:56.967 --> 21:59.767
OKEYDOKEY! TOODLE-OO!

21:59.767 --> 22:01.067
UH...

22:01.067 --> 22:04.333
JUST FORGET THAT LAST PART.

22:07.233 --> 22:08.167
- DOES THIS PLACE
HAVE AN EXIT?
