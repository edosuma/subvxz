WEBVTT

00:11.188 --> 00:13.988
On tonight's Holiday programme
we go to San Francisco
in California,

00:14.748 --> 00:20.588
we have a night out in Reno, Nevada-
and we end up on the salt flats
of Bonneville.

00:28.628 --> 00:30.748
Thank you, hello.

00:31.108 --> 00:32.387
Hello and welcome.

00:33.348 --> 00:36.308
Now that's all to come. But first,

00:37.188 --> 00:41.108
ever since Mr Barclays stop
lending money to Mr Lloyd and

00:41.868 --> 00:46.828
Mr Rock was bought by Mr Brown,
sales of flash new cars have
almost completely stopped.

00:47.908 --> 00:53.988
So does this mean it's the end
of the road for the petrolhead
or can you still have fun for 8p?

00:56.908 --> 01:01.268
This is the Fiat 500
and first things first,
James May doesn't like it at all.

01:03.228 --> 01:05.828
He says it's too cutesy, too twee.

01:07.508 --> 01:10.468
Mind you, we're talking about a
man who says if he came to power,

01:11.108 --> 01:15.948
his first job would be to
carpet-bomb the Cotswold town
of Burford.

01:19.948 --> 01:25.548
I, on the other hand, wouldn't bomb-
Burford so I like the little
Fiat a lot.

01:26.268 --> 01:29.948
Its £4,000 cheaper than a Mini,
it's also smaller,

01:30.468 --> 01:32.948
more economical
and I think better looking.

01:36.548 --> 01:38.188
And best of all, and I
know it this is a concept

01:38.828 --> 01:44.428
Eeyore May doesn't understand,
this car makes you feel happy.

01:46.428 --> 01:47.708
Yeah.

01:49.748 --> 01:52.628
And now there's a new version
and that's even better.

01:57.228 --> 02:00.028
This mad little scamp
is the 500 Abarth and
here are the headlines.

02:02.308 --> 02:08.268
The 1.4 litre engine
has been turbocharged,
producing 135 horsepower.

02:08.948 --> 02:12.428
It'll do 130mph.

02:15.228 --> 02:23.308
That's brilliant, except the car
I'm driving now is the SS version,
which produces 160 horsepower.

02:25.388 --> 02:30.028
160 horsepower
in a car the size of a shoe!

02:30.508 --> 02:31.908
That's fantastic.

02:38.508 --> 02:39.828
Heel and toe.

02:47.148 --> 02:49.268
With all that power going
through the front wheels,

02:51.108 --> 02:53.068
there's a bit of tug at the
steering
wheel - that's to be expected.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.548
The ride is quite bouncy.

02:58.228 --> 03:00.068
However, there's no bounciness
in the cheque you'll have to write

03:00.708 --> 03:04.868
because prices are going
to start at just £13,500.

03:08.108 --> 03:10.588
It's not what you'd
call barren in here.

03:11.228 --> 03:14.268
It's got a slot down here
into which you can plug your...

03:14.628 --> 03:15.308
Windows.

03:15.948 --> 03:21.788
It's got air-conditioning,
MP3 connectivity, a CD player
and a radio that plays...

03:22.508 --> 03:24.748
CRACKLE
Static.

03:26.908 --> 03:30.228
Although this could be Radio 1.

03:30.868 --> 03:35.508
You could solve that by fitting
an aerial and then you'd end up
with

03:36.108 --> 03:41.108
a small cuddly pet mouse that
can be used for killing burglars.

03:41.708 --> 03:47.188
However, there's one teeny
little thing that's niggling me.

03:47.828 --> 03:52.108
You see Abarth is to Fiat
what AMG is to Mercedes-Benz.

03:52.588 --> 03:55.188
It's an in-house tuning company.

03:55.988 --> 03:59.228
Only they're much, much more mad.

03:59.828 --> 04:02.788
For example, in the '80s
they got hold of the Strada

04:03.468 --> 04:05.388
and they fitted these
fabulous bucket seats.

04:06.228 --> 04:06.908
They were brilliant.

04:07.508 --> 04:08.588
Except you couldn't
tilt them forward

04:09.228 --> 04:12.148
because the headrest hit
the roof and so
you couldn't get in the back.

04:13.828 --> 04:18.108
That was nothing compared
to what they did to the 600.

04:18.708 --> 04:20.708
What they did
was tweaked the engine.

04:21.468 --> 04:24.868
And then they found the only way
of keeping it cool was to run
with the boot lid open.

04:25.388 --> 04:29.188
And then they found if they opened
the boot lid fully, in made the car

04:30.428 --> 04:33.108
11 kilometres an hour faster,
so this is how it was sold.

04:33.628 --> 04:35.588
With a boot lid
that can't be closed.

04:36.348 --> 04:40.388
That and seats that won't fold
forward, that's the Abarth way.

04:45.428 --> 04:48.468
And that's the niggle I have
with the new 500.

04:48.988 --> 04:51.588
Where's the lunacy?

04:55.668 --> 04:57.548
If we X-ray it, we find
the floor from a Panda,

04:58.188 --> 05:00.788
the engine from a Punto,

05:03.268 --> 05:07.708
a shape from the '60s
and some Abarth badges.

05:11.428 --> 05:14.388
Behind the louvres and the big
wheels and the lowered suspension,

05:15.028 --> 05:19.188
we find it has
seating for four - just.

05:20.388 --> 05:22.868
And a boot which is big enough
for things.

05:24.828 --> 05:27.628
On the move, it doesn't bark
or try to and turn itself
into an oven glove.

05:28.148 --> 05:33.388
And if you try to drive it with the-
bonnet open, it doesn't work at all.

05:34.548 --> 05:37.428
I can't see where I'm going!

05:37.788 --> 05:39.588
I can't see a thing.

05:45.588 --> 05:47.708
This car isn't mad in any way.

05:48.468 --> 05:52.268
But on the up side,
it's a pretty serious little racer.

05:58.428 --> 06:01.828
Listen to the noise - it growls.
Grrrr.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.428
I'm only this big but
I'm a Lamborghini really.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.788
I am, I really am. I promise.

06:10.428 --> 06:13.628
Look in here, it's got a steering
wheel trimmed in red and black like

06:14.148 --> 06:17.348
a man's wash bag and it's got
body-hugging leather seats and a

06:17.988 --> 06:22.948
button here that makes
more talk and another button
that does something racy.

06:23.788 --> 06:29.148
Look at this. A turbo boost gauge
the size of a fat spaniel's face.

06:32.948 --> 06:35.348
It corners well too.

06:35.828 --> 06:40.468
It's poised, composed, tidy,
no histrionics.

06:40.988 --> 06:43.708
You see, I told you I
was a Lamborghini. I am!

06:48.828 --> 06:51.948
In many ways, it reminds
me of the original Golf GTi.

06:52.588 --> 06:56.228
It's just a genuinely good,
small fast car.

07:04.428 --> 07:05.348
APPLAUSE

07:08.228 --> 07:09.908
I love it. I really love it.

07:10.548 --> 07:15.388
But as I said in the film, I do
miss some of that Abarth idiocy.

07:16.468 --> 07:17.868
What you're saying is it

07:18.468 --> 07:20.748
Yes. But you're just being obtuse.

07:21.348 --> 07:24.028
You're the one that wants to
attack the Cotswolds.

07:24.868 --> 07:26.868
Anyway, we must now find out how
fast it goes around our track.

07:27.388 --> 07:30.108
That means handing it over
to our tame racing driver.

07:31.148 --> 07:35.068
Some say he invented November.

07:36.828 --> 07:39.148
And that if he won the
World Championship in Brazil
last weekend,

07:39.788 --> 07:44.388
there might have been one
photograph of him without his
father gurning in the back of shot.

07:45.868 --> 07:48.108
All we know is
he's called the Stig.

07:49.828 --> 07:53.828
He's off, wheel spin there.This is
the first front-wheel-drive car
we've had on the track for a while.

07:54.468 --> 07:56.428
He's charging down
to the first corner.

07:57.508 --> 07:59.628
The hazards come on, hard braking.

08:00.148 --> 08:02.748
A sensible safety feature, not at
all what you want from an Abarth.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.628
MORSE CODE

08:09.588 --> 08:14.828
Stig's still listening to Morse
code - better than static, I
suppose as he squeaks round Chicago.

08:15.308 --> 08:16.948
And now down to the hammerhead.

08:19.028 --> 08:22.948
More hazard flashing but
it's front-wheel-drive

08:23.588 --> 08:27.348
Yes there's a limit to
the little terrier's grip.

08:27.828 --> 08:30.188
Yet he's got it all gathered
up in no time. Good boy.

08:35.748 --> 08:36.868
MORSE CODE

08:37.548 --> 08:40.227
Maybe he's signalling
to his home planet.

08:40.828 --> 08:43.428
Scampering through follow through,
panting and growling past the tyres.

08:43.948 --> 08:47.588
This kind of car would try to make
love to your leg. Two corners left.

08:48.548 --> 08:50.668
Clinging on bravely through there.

08:51.428 --> 08:55.428
Now coming up to Gambon,
turns in, kicks up some dust
and across the line.

08:56.028 --> 08:57.068
APPLAUSE

09:02.388 --> 09:03.908
Now...

09:04.628 --> 09:06.868
let's not forget
the little Fiat costs

09:07.348 --> 09:12.828
£756,000 less
than the Zonda F.

09:13.548 --> 09:15.908
You'd expect it to be
right down here.

09:16.988 --> 09:20.548
And it is. It's 135.5.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.188
And now let's do the news.

09:24.628 --> 09:27.468
And that little Fiat, I just love it.

09:27.948 --> 09:31.308
Seeing it on the telly as it bounces-
round a track, it's great.

09:32.028 --> 09:36.428
But if for some reason,
you're like Eeyore,
you don't want one of those...

09:37.108 --> 09:38.308
Are you wearing that for a bet?

09:40.828 --> 09:42.228
Yeah. OK. Go on.

09:43.828 --> 09:48.428
If, like Eeyore, you don't want one
of those, there's an alternative
super-fast micro car.

09:48.908 --> 09:50.908
This Renault Twingo 133.

09:52.348 --> 09:56.308
It's 0-68.7 seconds, 125 miles an
hour, not quite as fast as the Fiat.

09:56.908 --> 09:59.868
But more importantly that,
even with the clever

10:00.748 --> 10:07.148
sports chassis, a 650 quid option,
is still 1300 quid less
than the Fiat.

10:09.228 --> 10:11.548
That's extremely
good value for money. I love it.

10:12.188 --> 10:13.468
We've got one of those
in the studio over there.

10:15.028 --> 10:16.788
I've been driving at this
morning and I think it's excellent.

10:17.388 --> 10:18.428
Honestly, having
driven both of them,

10:19.428 --> 10:23.788
the Fiat is £1,000 more but it's
worth it. Does that make sense?

10:25.308 --> 10:32.428
And there's more fast small car
news from Renault with this,
which is the Megane R26R.

10:33.028 --> 10:34.308
I think that looks
really great as well.

10:35.748 --> 10:39.108
I saw that and thought
of you straight away.

10:39.548 --> 10:42.028
I thought what that James May is
going to want is a hatchback with

10:42.708 --> 10:47.068
red wheels, six-point harnesses,
a carbon fibre bonnet,
plastic windows.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.828
And James, it's French,
who you like to think of as
lamb-burning Communists.

10:52.428 --> 10:54.788
It's perfect for you in every way.
How did you arrive at wanting that?

10:55.748 --> 10:59.548
Because I like it.
James, you'd have to have literally

11:00.748 --> 11:03.548
no penis at all to buy a
car like that.

11:05.548 --> 11:07.748
How do you work that out?
We're always being told that

11:08.628 --> 11:12.428
the flashness of your car
is inversely proportionate
to the size...

11:13.028 --> 11:14.788
Am I talking sense here, girls?

11:16.908 --> 11:20.428
So the larger the man's car
and flasher it is, the vegetable
thing goes on.

11:21.068 --> 11:25.908
Is that right?
And you're saying that to a man
with a 1.2 litre Fiat Panda.

11:27.988 --> 11:31.188
Mr Swollen Wheel Arches
Mercedes CLK Black.

11:31.948 --> 11:33.548
He has a point there.
You've got a Ford Mustang.

11:34.228 --> 11:35.788
Let's move on.

11:37.108 --> 11:38.028
Can we stop talking about cars?

11:38.668 --> 11:42.188
Well, we weren't talking about cars.-
Not latterly,
but we were to start with.

11:43.108 --> 11:44.908
I want to congratulate
Lewis Hamilton.

11:45.388 --> 11:47.748
I think we all should.
CHEERING

11:48.468 --> 11:50.468
What a race, what a man.

11:50.948 --> 11:53.788
Well done. What a performance.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.188
A couple of tips
if you're watching, Lewis.

11:57.188 --> 12:02.668
We saw in the paper here
that his girlfriend said, the
one from the Pussycat Dolls -

12:06.108 --> 12:07.788
That's what she said after the race.

12:08.388 --> 12:12.308
We then saw in another paper that
he'd done this -

12:12.668 --> 12:14.068
Stayed up until 9am.

12:14.828 --> 12:19.788
If you've got a Pussycat Doll
saying you're going to get it
tonight, go to bed and have it.

12:20.668 --> 12:23.268
Maybe he didn't realise what
she meant. "I've already won it."

12:23.708 --> 12:25.748
No, not that!

12:26.348 --> 12:29.548
How could he get it so wrong?
We're a bit baffled by that.

12:30.388 --> 12:34.428
Next year, this is the good thing
about Formula One,
it's coming home to the BBC.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.908
CHEERING

12:37.508 --> 12:39.508
No adverts.

12:40.148 --> 12:44.268
The only problem we've got is there
are some people speculating

12:45.508 --> 12:48.668
the person getting the commentary
job, going to be the modern-day
Murray Walker, is Richard Hammond.

12:49.188 --> 12:51.788
I've seen that in the papers.
It came as a surprise.

12:52.348 --> 12:55.468
He's never watched a Formula One
race in his life. No, actually.

12:57.388 --> 12:59.668
You weren't even watching last
weekend. No. I was driving home.

13:00.588 --> 13:03.068
Did you look around and think
"The traffic's quiet tonight?"

13:03.548 --> 13:05.708
I did get a clear run, I must say.

13:06.188 --> 13:08.788
If he got the job it really would
be, "And they're off and look

13:10.708 --> 13:12.228
"at the idiot in the Mercedes
holding them up."

13:12.708 --> 13:14.268
No, Richard, that's the parade lap.

13:14.868 --> 13:17.188
There's a red one in the lead.
He's pulled in - what, for petrol?

13:17.708 --> 13:19.468
Why didn't
he fill up before he left?"

13:21.308 --> 13:23.068
I freely admit I wouldn't
be very good at that.

13:23.548 --> 13:27.588
He would be the worst person
in the world for that job...

13:28.068 --> 13:29.948
Well, not absolutely.

13:31.668 --> 13:33.028
Who would be good?
Anyone got any thoughts?

13:33.868 --> 13:36.348
Dale Winton. Dale Winton.

13:37.788 --> 13:39.188
Brilliant.

13:39.788 --> 13:42.548
Russell Brand. Russell Brand. Yes!

13:43.708 --> 13:44.428
No!

13:45.388 --> 13:48.468
I rang Rolf Schumacher and...
we're off the air.

13:52.308 --> 13:53.228
Took time.

14:00.348 --> 14:03.388
I can't think of anybody.
It's going to have to be me.

14:04.868 --> 14:06.868
Now, the time has come, I fear.

14:07.508 --> 14:11.028
Lots of complaints after last
week's programme,
internet awash with...

14:11.508 --> 14:14.588
hate, people demanding an apology
and I'm only too happy to give one.

14:15.348 --> 14:18.668
I'm very sorry that I didn't put
the GT2's time on the board.

14:20.228 --> 14:21.988
APPLAUSE

14:22.948 --> 14:24.828
I don't know what to say.

14:26.828 --> 14:29.628
We had more complaints
about that than we did
about burning Steve Redgrave's shed.

14:31.548 --> 14:32.628
But what was the time?

14:35.828 --> 14:36.988
it wasn't.
It was exactly the same time.

14:38.268 --> 14:40.148
119.6 or something.

14:40.508 --> 14:41.948
It was exactly the same time.

14:42.788 --> 14:45.388
There you go. So it's the same
as your four-wheel-drive Lambo,

14:45.988 --> 14:47.868
or the two-wheel-drive Porsche
did it.

14:48.268 --> 14:51.228
You can do it once in the Porsche.
The second lap would kill you.

14:51.828 --> 14:53.828
Only if you were a useless coward.
It's a better car.

14:56.108 --> 15:01.028
Time to move on.
What we have down here is a
selection of American muscle cars.

15:01.748 --> 15:03.468
The recipe for this sort of
thing was always very simple.

15:04.108 --> 15:10.908
Massive engine, crude,
simple suspension, very low price
and finally, some orange paint.

15:11.508 --> 15:14.108
This sort of thing never really
caught on in the civilised world.

15:15.108 --> 15:19.708
We thought that what with petrol
prices being so high now, they'd
have died out in America as well.

15:20.348 --> 15:25.068
However, in the last few months,
three brand-new American
muscle cars have arrived.

15:25.868 --> 15:29.628
So we thought we'd best
pop over to the States
and find out if they were any good.

15:29.988 --> 15:32.348
Unfortunately, there was a problem.

15:32.988 --> 15:37.348
You see, we all have visas
which allow us to go to America
and make a factual documentary.

15:38.108 --> 15:43.468
But since our last trip over there,-
when I might have accidentally
put a cow on the roof of my car,

15:44.068 --> 15:47.028
the American - the US State
Department, no less - has decided

15:48.468 --> 15:51.428
Top Gear is actually now
an entertainment show.

15:52.428 --> 15:56.828
Unfortunately, that requires
a different type of visa, and
we didn't have time to get one.

15:57.548 --> 16:02.908
So in the end, we were only allowed-
into the country if we promised -
this isn't a lie, is it?

16:03.988 --> 16:05.628
This is absolutely true,
hand on heart.

16:06.268 --> 16:09.188
..If we promised
not to be entertaining.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.708
The idea was that we'd meet up
with our muscle cars
in San Francisco,

16:20.228 --> 16:24.028
the 14th most populous city
in America.

16:25.348 --> 16:29.428
But immediately,
we ran into another problem.

16:33.508 --> 16:36.708
This is the Cadillac CTS-V
that James will be driving.

16:37.548 --> 16:41.108
This is the Corvette ZR1
that I'll be driving.

16:44.148 --> 16:49.428
And this is an empty space where
Richard's Dodge Challenger
should have been parked.

16:50.428 --> 16:54.108
It isn't here because Chrysler, the
people who make the Dodge Challenger,

16:54.748 --> 16:59.508
said we're always horrid about their-
cars, and decided at the last minute-
not to lend us one.

17:00.508 --> 17:05.588
If this was normal Top Gear,
we'd just make a Challenger
out of leaves or something.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.708
Or push Hammond off there
and carry on without him.

17:09.068 --> 17:11.268
Exactly,
but we decided to show Chrysler...

17:11.828 --> 17:13.308
In a factual,
not an entertaining way...

17:14.308 --> 17:17.108
..that Britain is not a bankrupt
rock in the North Atlantic,

17:17.748 --> 17:21.428
and that we will not be pushed
around by a two-bit car company.

17:26.228 --> 17:28.708
This is a Dodge Challenger
that I've just bought. Yeah!

17:29.828 --> 17:31.708
Thought you could stop us,
didn't you?

17:35.588 --> 17:37.588
Because of demand for these cars
over here right now, I've had to pay

17:38.188 --> 17:42.068
$51,000, which is $10,000
more than the list price.

17:46.228 --> 17:49.748
But all the same, I reckon, what,
£28,000 is not a lot for

17:50.388 --> 17:54.188
425 horsepower and a sound that
can start earthquakes.

17:55.988 --> 17:57.628
DEEP ROARING
Oh, yeah!

17:59.788 --> 18:02.028
That's subtle.

18:02.428 --> 18:05.388
'Once we were all assembled,
we broke out the map.

18:06.028 --> 18:11.188
'We had to get from San Francisco
across California and Nevada
to the Bonneville salt flats

18:11.188 --> 18:19.028
'in Utah...where in three days'
time, we'd been entered
for the Speed Week drag races.'

18:19.668 --> 18:24.788
Look, you two,
no irony, no hyperbole, no sarcasm
and don't put a cow on your roof.

18:25.228 --> 18:27.228
Can I crash into James
every time we stop? No.

18:27.708 --> 18:29.228
Just a tiny... No! All right.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.508
If Hammond drives
into May's car, Bruce Willis

18:35.028 --> 18:37.828
will come in a state department
gunship, and we will all be killed!

18:40.868 --> 18:42.628
We burbled out
of San Francisco, which is,

18:43.228 --> 18:49.428
er, the 14th most populous city
in America, towards the Golden Gate.

18:53.068 --> 19:00.588
Opened in 1937, this $27 million
colossus...is much like
the Humber Bridge in Britain.

19:02.508 --> 19:03.788
Only smaller.

19:05.508 --> 19:08.108
I want to make it plain.
That was a fact.

19:09.668 --> 19:11.068
And here's another one.

19:11.708 --> 19:16.708
After just half an hour,
James had decided he didn't
like his Cadillac very much.

19:17.508 --> 19:18.948
What exactly

19:18.948 --> 19:20.628
were they thinking of?

19:20.628 --> 19:23.588
This ambassador for the relaxed
American way of travelling

19:24.468 --> 19:31.148
around in style has a 6.2 litre
supercharged V8,
developing 556 horsepower.

19:32.108 --> 19:35.428
It's just not necessary.

19:35.428 --> 19:37.988
The moaning went on.

19:37.988 --> 19:42.588
What was wrong with being a
Cadillac? It's supposed to be
soft and floaty, you're supposed...

19:48.148 --> 19:51.588
..and sending a car
around the Nurburgring spoils it.

19:51.588 --> 19:54.548
Simple as that. I see why
the muscle car never caught on...

20:01.468 --> 20:05.108
Unlike James,
I absolutely understand
the appeal of muscle cars.

20:06.068 --> 20:08.228
Factually,
they're like killer whales.

20:08.228 --> 20:09.988
Very striking to look at, very fast.

20:10.708 --> 20:12.228
But you wouldn't want to own one.

20:12.988 --> 20:17.388
'This Corvette ZR1
is a classic case in point.'

20:17.388 --> 20:22.068
I've the same basic engine that
James has in his Cadillac,

20:22.068 --> 20:28.868
but while he has to make do with
only 550 horsepower, I have 640.

20:29.348 --> 20:31.228
ENGINE REVS

20:31.748 --> 20:33.988
That is intoxicating.

20:36.788 --> 20:40.668
I'm not being entertaining,
I'm just saying, that is...

20:41.628 --> 20:43.748
really incredible.

20:45.348 --> 20:52.268
It may cost $100,000 - a lot for a
Corvette - but it is Enzo fast.

20:53.468 --> 20:55.468
0-60 takes three seconds.

20:55.468 --> 20:58.828
The top speed is 205.

21:00.188 --> 21:05.028
It is ballistic, but you can't
have a Corvette in Britain.

21:06.348 --> 21:08.388
It's too brash, too ghastly.

21:09.268 --> 21:16.748
It'd be like turning up at
one of the Queen's garden parties
in chromed cowboy boots and chaps.

21:18.148 --> 21:25.028
Of course, Hammond failed to
understand any of this because deep-
down, he is a secret American.

21:27.428 --> 21:28.748
I love muscle cars.

21:30.508 --> 21:31.988
I love the fact that they're

21:31.988 --> 21:35.428
about racing away from the lights
when the police aren't looking.

21:35.428 --> 21:39.348
They're about cowboy boots,
work boots, denim jeans,
dime stores, bars. I love that.

21:41.988 --> 21:43.268
I'm feeling cooler already.

21:43.268 --> 21:44.828
I'm chewing gum and everything.

21:48.468 --> 21:54.668
James, meanwhile, wasn't even
enjoying the excellent music
on the local radio station.

21:54.668 --> 21:56.668
MUSIC: "JESSICA"
("TOP GEAR" THEME)

21:57.748 --> 21:59.748
I wasn't expecting to hear that.

22:00.588 --> 22:04.188
"On tonight's programme..."

22:07.348 --> 22:12.788
High in the Sierra Nevada we pulled
over next to Lake Tahoe,mountains,

22:13.988 --> 22:17.468
the eighth deepest lake
in the world.

22:18.188 --> 22:22.628
But because we could only look
at its shimmering beauty in a
factual way, we didn't bother...

22:22.628 --> 22:27.348
and concentrated instead on teasing-
Hammond about some of the
facts on his Challenger.

22:29.668 --> 22:32.748
Is this real carbon fibre?
No. Are these real

22:32.748 --> 22:34.508
ram air scoops? No.

22:35.148 --> 22:38.188
Sorry, Richard... It's
not supposed to be a Rolls-Royce.

22:39.148 --> 22:41.628
It's simple,
it's fast, it's a worker's car.

22:42.308 --> 22:45.828
It's for blue-collar workers...
Were you born in the USA?
What has happened to you?

22:46.908 --> 22:47.468
Put it this way.

22:48.068 --> 22:48.908
This is like a bodybuilder.

22:49.628 --> 22:53.028
Hugely impressive,
but when you take its trunks down,
it's "Hello, Mr Squirrel".

22:53.988 --> 22:56.108
BEEP

22:57.508 --> 22:58.988
What do you mean,
you put it in a melon?

22:59.588 --> 23:01.828
Sorry. Don't send helicopters.

23:02.348 --> 23:03.588
Why have you got
secondary double-glazing on

23:04.108 --> 23:06.348
your bonnet?
What's the point of that?

23:07.708 --> 23:13.308
Lamborghini and Ferrari put a glass-
engine cover on these days, so you
can see the craftsmanship. This?

23:13.788 --> 23:15.748
So you can see some
writing and some showing off.

23:16.348 --> 23:18.268
I quite like that. You... I do!

23:19.708 --> 23:22.188
I like it. The Ferrari's made
by craftsmen in Maranello.

23:22.788 --> 23:25.268
This is made by two
fat blokes in Kentucky.

23:25.628 --> 23:27.388
Called Bud and Bob.

23:28.388 --> 23:31.428
This plastic comes from the
same plastic they use to
make newsreaders over here.

23:31.908 --> 23:35.228
That's the same colour as well.

23:35.868 --> 23:37.388
Is there nothing about
your car that you like?

23:37.948 --> 23:39.868
Factually? No.

23:40.948 --> 23:44.988
Cos last time we were here,
you bought a Cadillac,
and you loved that.

23:45.828 --> 23:47.348
Yeah, but I was being entertaining.

23:50.508 --> 23:54.428
'Fearful that James may have
made a joke, we decided to leave'.

23:55.028 --> 23:57.308
Quickly, Bruce Willis will be here.-
I can hear helicopters.

24:01.348 --> 24:04.548
After an hour or so, there was a
worrying announcement from Jeremy.

24:06.948 --> 24:08.588
I'm starting to like this Corvette.

24:09.788 --> 24:11.708
It's ridiculous.

24:13.828 --> 24:15.348
It isn't the power.

24:15.868 --> 24:18.108
It's the surprise of the power.

24:18.748 --> 24:22.908
When you're driving a Ferrari Enzo,-
you expect it to go like Stig.

24:23.508 --> 24:26.108
But this is quiet,
comfortable, spacious.

24:26.948 --> 24:28.588
It's beautifully air-conditioned.

24:29.428 --> 24:33.588
So you're simply not
ready for the savagery
when you put your foot down.

24:35.508 --> 24:37.868
Whoa!

24:39.948 --> 24:44.548
And I've got a display
with my lateral G
and my supercharger pressure.

24:45.148 --> 24:47.388
And I've got the best
stereo in the world!

24:49.308 --> 24:52.028
Facts, Jeremy, facts.

24:55.788 --> 25:02.308
'As night began to fall and with
James still complaining about his
car...' ..To make a BMW M5...

25:04.868 --> 25:06.628
'We arrived in Reno.

25:08.548 --> 25:11.388
'Which is like Las Vegas,
only smaller.

25:12.708 --> 25:14.708
'And worse.'

25:15.308 --> 25:18.668
It's a town with some
light bulbs on it.

25:18.668 --> 25:22.588
Weirdly, James made
straight for a casino.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.348
Can't wait, sorry.

25:27.748 --> 25:31.148
While out on the street,
I was trying to keep
the Duke of Hammond under control.

25:32.708 --> 25:35.348
Don't race between the lights.

25:41.948 --> 25:45.148
No! Yeah, that's what we mustn't do.

25:47.108 --> 25:50.388
In Nevada's casinos, you can
usually win a car of some sort.

25:51.508 --> 25:54.228
Sadly, the prize in this casino
was this.

25:56.908 --> 25:59.228
Still, it was better
than that stupid Cadillac.

26:05.828 --> 26:06.508
Evening.

26:09.388 --> 26:12.348
Meanwhile we were still thinking of-
things we weren't supposed to do...

26:13.308 --> 26:14.468
to do.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.828
Ready? Here, OK? Go.

26:18.748 --> 26:20.068
ENGINES REV

26:21.868 --> 26:22.668
CAR ALARMS SOUND

26:23.388 --> 26:27.308
'Two revving V8s, and the alarms
went berserk'. Run away! Run away!

26:27.828 --> 26:29.548
Go, go, go!
Don't screech your wheels.

26:30.148 --> 26:31.468
WHEELS SCREECH

26:32.308 --> 26:37.308
That helped,
Jeremy, that helped!

26:37.308 --> 26:39.428
You won't change it
unless you change that.

26:40.068 --> 26:43.348
Yeah, it won't change unless you
change that. Now you're hit again.

26:44.188 --> 26:45.948
Where are you guys from, Australia?

26:46.588 --> 26:49.068
'James wasn't really
enjoying his company.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.028
'But then, neither was Jeremy.'

26:52.508 --> 26:54.988
I didn't know you were the police.
Real police. Well...

26:55.508 --> 26:59.148
Police. You were squealing the tyres-
and revving the engine.

26:59.668 --> 27:01.068
My foot slipped off the clutch.

27:01.788 --> 27:03.668
No. I don't buy that for a second.
Sorry.

27:05.588 --> 27:06.988
Oh, dear.

27:08.348 --> 27:11.188
'After a ticking off from the we
went to find James.'police,

27:14.308 --> 27:17.148
That's desperate. That is desperate.-
That is desperate.

27:17.748 --> 27:19.508
You'd rather have that
than your Cadillac? Yep.

27:20.108 --> 27:22.868
What is that? It's hideous.

27:23.948 --> 27:27.388
'We decided to turn in and leave
James with his new best friends.'

27:29.308 --> 27:29.988
Are you, er...

27:30.348 --> 27:32.868
John Lennon, or...? Might be.

27:33.588 --> 27:36.068
Well, you're from
the best band that I ever heard.

27:36.868 --> 27:38.068
Thank you.

27:38.508 --> 27:39.948
APPLAUSE

27:41.148 --> 27:44.228
Not arrested yet.
Right, we'll pick that up later on,

27:44.868 --> 27:47.428
but now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably priced car.

27:48.228 --> 27:54.148
My guest tonight won a programme
called Pop Idol, which of course
means I've never heard of it.

27:55.148 --> 27:58.828
Bit difficult, this, but ladies
and gentlemen, please welcome
that man over there!

28:03.228 --> 28:04.548
You know who I am! I know!

28:05.468 --> 28:08.108
It's Will Young, everybody!

28:08.668 --> 28:10.348
I'm being obtuse.

28:11.908 --> 28:13.428
I'm being obtuse again.

28:14.188 --> 28:18.228
Now, I'm not very good at
chat-shows, as we discovered last
week. We had Michael Parkinson on,

28:19.668 --> 28:22.388
and what's really worrying me is
that when Simon Cowell came here,

28:23.108 --> 28:28.028
I may have said accidentally
that you look like you've been
hit in the face with an axe.

28:30.868 --> 28:32.388
And now you're here!

28:33.028 --> 28:35.348
I get that, because I do

28:35.828 --> 28:37.508
had Slick Jaw McGraw, you know.

28:38.948 --> 28:42.028
But I've never heard "hit in the
face with an axe"! It's like, "Ow!

28:43.428 --> 28:44.828
"Look what you've done now".

28:45.468 --> 28:48.308
The thing I find interesting
is that you have actually got a

28:48.908 --> 28:52.348
career out of winning Pop Idol,
which of course became the X Factor.

28:52.828 --> 28:54.948
Yeah. Because most of them don't.

28:55.708 --> 29:00.348
Looking at the winners, I have to
refer to notes here, cos they're
meaningless names. Shane Warne.

29:01.428 --> 29:02.828
Shayne Ward!

29:03.468 --> 29:07.748
I don't know! What's Warne?
He's a cricketer! Even I know that.
Shane Warne's a cricketer?

29:08.468 --> 29:12.508
I don't know anything
about cricket either.
It's like talking to my dad.

29:12.988 --> 29:15.028
Leon Jackson?

29:17.148 --> 29:18.308
He's good?

29:19.148 --> 29:20.908
He's not as good as Camel Or Gong,
trust me.

29:22.028 --> 29:25.908
Nobody's heard of Camel Or Gong,
Focus or Genesis,
Led Zeppelin, The Who?

29:26.428 --> 29:27.708
Smoke On The Water,
people normally get that one.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.708
What's Smoke On The Water?

29:30.068 --> 29:31.948
Oh, for God's sake!

29:32.548 --> 29:37.348
But this is you. Your record
collection doesn't go past...1979,

29:37.948 --> 29:40.788
does it? When were you born?
I was born in 1979.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.268
See, this is your problem.

29:43.868 --> 29:46.868
You were born the year,
quite literally, the music died.

29:46.868 --> 29:50.068
The Clash...The Clash were
pretty much over in '79.

29:51.268 --> 29:53.868
Prog rock was over. What was
going on when you were growing up?

29:54.948 --> 29:56.108
What music did you listen to?

29:56.868 --> 29:59.668
I listened to my parents',
so it would have been
Joni Mitchell, the Beatles...

30:00.548 --> 30:02.548
This explains why you're
so successful now.

30:03.388 --> 30:04.548
You've got a new album out.
What's that called?

30:05.148 --> 30:07.508
Let It Go, which I think sounds
like a self-help book,

30:08.588 --> 30:09.748
but it's the only title I could...

30:10.468 --> 30:12.708
And you're on the South Bank Show
now. You really have achieved.

30:13.308 --> 30:15.068
X Factor to the South
Bank Show is astonishing.

30:15.868 --> 30:19.628
Yeah, but this, I'm
dead chuffed to be on this show,
cos I'm quite an avid watcher.

30:20.108 --> 30:24.188
I am the guy that watches
the re-runs of this on Dave.

30:25.708 --> 30:27.988
Really? Cos I've often wondered,
who's watching it again?

30:28.428 --> 30:31.068
That's me! I am the loser!

30:31.788 --> 30:32.908
So are you a bit of a car man?

30:33.668 --> 30:36.868
I am a car man, and my family
have always been car mad.

30:37.588 --> 30:40.068
My grandparents used to
have amazing cars.

30:40.628 --> 30:43.588
They had XK120s. They had a Bristol.

30:44.108 --> 30:45.868
My grandmother had an Alfa Spider.

30:46.628 --> 30:49.788
They always had...and My mum
and Dad have always been into cars.

30:50.428 --> 30:53.748
And also, we do love each other,
but we don't really get on that well.

30:54.308 --> 30:55.388
So when we go on holiday,

30:56.228 --> 30:59.188
if we go to Scotland or something,
we all drive in our separate cars!

30:59.868 --> 31:01.068
We can't be in the car together.

31:01.668 --> 31:02.588
Seriously? Yeah.

31:03.068 --> 31:04.468
Does it ever develop into a race?

31:05.828 --> 31:09.388
We have...no, cos we're
very responsible and we don't

31:09.828 --> 31:12.348
have races. I did a race once.

31:12.908 --> 31:14.708
I did a Top Gear race. Really? Yeah.

31:15.628 --> 31:17.388
I had the best car I've ever driven,

31:18.268 --> 31:23.788
a Range Rover supercharged Sport,
and my friends were flying back from

31:24.948 --> 31:28.268
Newquay, and we were driving back,
and we did our own Top Gear...race.

31:29.468 --> 31:30.508
See who could get back to London?

31:31.108 --> 31:33.988
Notting Hill. That's interesting.
Who won? We won. In the car?

31:34.428 --> 31:36.588
Yeah. Good man! That's the ticket.

31:37.388 --> 31:38.308
APPLAUSE

31:41.108 --> 31:45.868
So where did your car story begin?
What was the first car you had?

31:46.228 --> 31:47.268
The inevitable Mini?

31:48.108 --> 31:50.388
There was a Mini,
yeah, racing green Mini.

31:51.188 --> 31:53.428
Which was great, because...
I think of it like Lego.

31:53.908 --> 31:57.588
I remember buying another Mini
for 80 quid just for the wheels,

31:58.468 --> 32:01.028
and then you put bucket seats in
and you had racing pedals,

32:01.668 --> 32:03.428
and you could just interchange
the whole time.

32:04.188 --> 32:07.108
You should always start with Minis.-
It's the right place to start.
It's like a go-kart.

32:07.868 --> 32:11.388
You're so low down, you feel
like you're doing 100. The wing
mirrors used to flap at 80.

32:12.028 --> 32:13.908
You are interested in aesthetics.

32:16.228 --> 32:21.588
Property is an area you've moved
into? Yeah. I love doing them up.

32:22.028 --> 32:24.908
I've just got a place in Brighton
and it was quite dilapidated,

32:25.388 --> 32:26.668
and I loved, sort of,

32:27.268 --> 32:30.388
bringing it back to former glory.
Does yours always end up rubbish?

32:31.468 --> 32:34.868
Cos when I've just done
my house up, you just think,
"What did I do that for?"

32:35.348 --> 32:36.268
But it's quite addictive.

32:37.028 --> 32:41.548
Mmm. Everything, down to
the right cushion, you know,
I like the whole detail.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.428
I've just had that exact thing.

32:44.308 --> 32:47.108
The poor woman trying
to get my cushion fabric -
you may find this surprising,

32:47.788 --> 32:50.908
but I've been going, "No,
the brown stripe's too wide.
I want more orange".

32:53.588 --> 32:56.188
I wouldn't have you down
for that type of man.

32:56.788 --> 32:59.988
Maybe we should start a programme.
Jeremy and Will do up Surrey houses.

33:00.468 --> 33:01.868
I'd love to do up Surrey houses.

33:03.188 --> 33:05.188
Us fighting over shag-pile carpets.

33:05.788 --> 33:08.628
I don't like shag-pile.
Neither do I.

33:09.228 --> 33:11.748
LAUGHTER

33:13.028 --> 33:16.628
Have you ever been to the Chelsea
Flower Show? I have, actually!

33:17.268 --> 33:21.148
I went to the Chelsea
Flower Show to get a water
feature...talk among yourselves.

33:21.668 --> 33:24.028
Pathetic! They are
useless, water features.

33:25.588 --> 33:27.468
I've just got some
authentic Spanish tiles

33:27.988 --> 33:31.628
for my garden, and a water feature
and it's slate, but the water's...

33:32.868 --> 33:35.468
What colour slate, grey?
Yeah, that's the colour of slate!

33:36.068 --> 33:39.148
Yeah, but... This is
how the show could go!

33:39.788 --> 33:42.028
It would either go
incredibly well,

33:43.108 --> 33:45.468
to new heights...

33:46.148 --> 33:47.188
Or it could end in a massive fight.

33:47.708 --> 33:51.268
And you'd probably kill me. No,
I've got arms like pipe cleaners.

33:51.748 --> 33:53.988
You're quite trim. I mean,
not trim. Fit. Not fit.

33:54.468 --> 33:56.588
I'm saying all the wrong things.

33:57.308 --> 33:59.308
LAUGHTER

33:59.948 --> 34:02.748
Right, now, your lap.
How did it go out there?

34:03.468 --> 34:04.268
I think I did all right.

34:04.788 --> 34:08.788
But some things the Stig was saying
to me, I just didn't quite get...

34:09.428 --> 34:10.588
particularly the last corner.

34:11.348 --> 34:14.027
I had a lot of problems
with the last corner.

34:14.547 --> 34:16.027
I have to say,
the Stig was impressed.

34:16.628 --> 34:18.547
Really? He was impressed.

34:19.148 --> 34:22.188
You were let down slightly by the
lord of weather today, drizzling.

34:22.828 --> 34:24.348
Yeah, it started drizzling,
which I think is the worst.

34:24.828 --> 34:26.828
But he says you're fearless.

34:28.628 --> 34:30.987
And also a precision,
I mean, a feel for cars.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.868
Oh, good! Shall we see how he got
on?

34:34.348 --> 34:36.708
I know everyone says this
- I'm so nervous.

34:37.428 --> 34:39.908
I'll either be elated,
or I shall be weeping.

34:40.628 --> 34:42.547
Let's have a look at the lap.
Here we go.

34:44.668 --> 34:49.228
I've just turned the air con off,
thinking it would make a difference.

34:49.947 --> 34:51.348
How competitive I am!

34:52.027 --> 34:53.947
It'll make a huge difference.
About 10% more power.

34:54.428 --> 34:57.988
Oh, you see, yeah. You really
are intent. Look at this.

34:58.388 --> 35:00.948
Windscreen wipers on - how do
they work? Can't see anything.

35:02.388 --> 35:04.148
But it's raining.
You do need to have them on.

35:04.788 --> 35:07.868
That's not bad, if you
can get it back in tight again
on the exit, which you have.

35:08.428 --> 35:10.828
I'm so sweaty. Come on!

35:12.188 --> 35:14.268
Hammerhead. Hammerhead. Hammerhead.-
It's very hard, that.

35:14.788 --> 35:16.548
It's the hardest corner
on any track.

35:17.148 --> 35:20.548
If you keep it in those lines...
Yes! Look at that.

35:21.068 --> 35:22.348
Hey, that's all right, isn't it?
Don't lift off the gas. Yes.

35:23.068 --> 35:26.268
And you didn't go over the red
and whites. Flat out through there.

35:29.028 --> 35:30.188
This is BLEEP terrifying.

35:34.188 --> 35:36.428
Oh, now we slowed down.
That's too slow. Too slow!

35:37.188 --> 35:39.268
I know, I just couldn't ...
Were you frightened a bit about
crashing there? There we are!

35:40.588 --> 35:41.748
Across the line.

35:42.348 --> 35:43.748
APPLAUSE

35:45.308 --> 35:47.308
That second to last corner.

35:47.908 --> 35:48.828
What happened?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.188
Where do you reckon then?

35:51.948 --> 35:56.228
Now, bear in mind if it's wet,
as you can see, the wet laps start
down here. This is very wet.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.228
Keith Allen, Rob Brydon.

35:58.708 --> 36:01.788
They're down in the 151s.

36:02.148 --> 36:03.468
Do I get a wet lap?

36:03.948 --> 36:06.548
Oh yes, there's no question it was
wet. I'm assured by the Stig...

36:07.028 --> 36:08.788
Well, damp. I'll put a D on it.

36:10.228 --> 36:11.628
Or an M. Which do you want?
Would you like moist or damp?

36:12.708 --> 36:14.348
LAUGHTER

36:16.548 --> 36:18.508
They've got to do that show,
you know. It would be brilliant.

36:19.868 --> 36:22.828
D, please. D. Right,
you've got a D for damp.

36:23.908 --> 36:25.308
Oh, God.

36:25.788 --> 36:27.188
Come on, hazard a guess.

36:27.708 --> 36:28.828
Hazard? Oh God, I don't know.

36:29.708 --> 36:32.028
I'd like to be in the top ten.
You can't be. It's wet. All right,

36:32.668 --> 36:35.268
well, I'd like to be in the top ten
of the damp, wet people.

36:35.868 --> 36:37.388
Of the damp people. OK.
I have to say,

36:38.108 --> 36:39.508
I'm just prolonging your agony now.

36:40.108 --> 36:43.428
Oh, you're such a BLEEP, aren't you?-
You can't put that out.

36:43.908 --> 36:45.908
You did it in one minute...

36:48.428 --> 36:52.508
48.9. That's the fastest wet lap
we've ever had.

36:53.108 --> 36:54.588
APPLAUSE

36:55.308 --> 36:56.508
That is right...

37:00.788 --> 37:01.628
Is that good?

37:02.948 --> 37:05.708
I know you're going to look
disappointed but it's not our fault.

37:06.148 --> 37:07.308
I'm a little disappointed.

37:08.028 --> 37:11.508
I think that's an incredibly
good time on a damp track.

37:12.228 --> 37:14.588
OK. It's been brilliant. Thank you.
It's been great fun having you.
A car fan at last!

37:15.188 --> 37:16.828
Ladies and gentlemen, Will Young!

37:17.908 --> 37:18.948
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

37:26.428 --> 37:30.348
Now, tonight, we're trying to get
three fast cars from San Francisco

37:31.108 --> 37:33.908
to the speed week drag races,
at the Bonneville salt flats.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.148
Usual range of problems.

37:36.908 --> 37:40.548
We've got visas that only allow us
to be factual, not entertaining.

37:41.028 --> 37:43.308
Jeremy has met a policeman.

37:43.908 --> 37:45.908
And James hates his car.

37:46.508 --> 37:51.028
We rejoin the action at Reno, which
is, factually speaking, a toilet.

37:53.588 --> 37:56.388
'Good morning. This is KAOL
and it's another beautiful day

37:58.308 --> 37:59.588
'in northern Nevada.'

38:02.108 --> 38:04.508
Not for James, it wasn't.

38:07.628 --> 38:09.508
He'd been up all night,
hadn't won the trike,

38:10.148 --> 38:12.828
and was now facing another day
in his hateful Cadillac.

38:16.428 --> 38:19.428
What an appalling cackhole.

38:22.548 --> 38:25.668
Now, the quick way from Reno to
Bonneville is on the Interstate.

38:26.868 --> 38:31.868
But, to cheer James up, Hammond
and I decided not to use it.

38:33.548 --> 38:35.668
Chaps, why are we
going the long way round?

38:36.308 --> 38:38.388
Well, because we've got
really good cars.

38:40.268 --> 38:46.548
We would be using the I50, which
has been known as the loneliest
road in America since 1986.

38:47.268 --> 38:50.228
That's a staggering 22 years.

38:52.388 --> 38:55.268
It crosses all of Nevada and is
famous for going past almost

38:55.948 --> 38:59.068
nothing of any interest whatsoever.

39:00.148 --> 39:03.788
It was on this very road that they
shot the epic film Vanishing Point.

39:08.988 --> 39:12.308
It was about a bloke being chased
by police in a Dodge Challenger.

39:14.748 --> 39:18.748
He smashed into a digger and
was killed, I seem to remember.
I don't want to do that bit.

39:22.668 --> 39:25.828
That sound of a big V8 growling
and bellowing across the desert

39:27.028 --> 39:30.348
has got to be one of the single
most evocative noises in the world.

39:35.388 --> 39:37.268
Look at that road. Look at it.

39:38.268 --> 39:41.548
You could just become mesmerised
by the straightness of it.

39:46.148 --> 39:50.068
After a while, though, we became
bored by the straightness of it.

39:51.988 --> 39:56.628
There are 213 stitches
on my door panel.

39:57.588 --> 40:02.468
If you add up all the numbers on
my dashboard, it comes to 1,247.

40:04.388 --> 40:07.468
My battery is producing 12.9 volts.

40:10.508 --> 40:13.228
To liven things up, I decided
to stop for some elevenses...

40:15.388 --> 40:16.468
..Corvette style!

40:18.000 --> 40:24.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

40:30.268 --> 40:31.188
What are you doing?

40:31.708 --> 40:33.548
I've just laid these black
lines on the road and I bet you

40:34.068 --> 40:35.468
you can't do longer ones.

40:37.748 --> 40:39.388
I bet you a million pounds I can.

40:40.308 --> 40:42.468
This is what this car's for!

40:42.948 --> 40:43.668
What are we doing?

40:44.148 --> 40:47.228
You're keeping a lookout while
he tries to lay longer black lines

40:47.868 --> 40:49.108
down the road than I've managed.
But what if somebody sees us?

40:49.588 --> 40:51.268
I don't think they will. Ready?

40:54.868 --> 40:56.508
I don't think they will. Ready?

40:59.388 --> 41:00.908
Yes. Here I go.

41:02.348 --> 41:03.508
Ha-ha-ha!

41:04.508 --> 41:07.948
Hopeless. This may be harder
than I thought. It's automatic.

41:08.468 --> 41:11.028
Right, back him out the way.
Let's see if May can do it.

41:11.508 --> 41:12.428
This can only go well.

41:13.068 --> 41:14.068
Have you turned the traction
control off? Yes.

41:14.588 --> 41:16.588
Have you ever done that
in your life? No.

41:17.788 --> 41:20.628
I think it's game of him
to join in. Right, lots of revs,
steering wheel straight.

41:29.708 --> 41:33.068
Oooh! Oh, cock!

41:33.668 --> 41:36.268
You are such an imbecile.
What do you call that?

41:36.788 --> 41:39.628
I over corrected. How well does
that bode for Bonneville?

41:40.228 --> 41:41.628
He can't drive in a straight line.

41:43.908 --> 41:47.348
Traction control. On.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.268
We tried going back
to being factual.

41:53.068 --> 41:54.108
Cows.

41:54.708 --> 41:56.708
But soon we ran out of facts.

42:17.508 --> 42:18.908
Oh God, look.

42:19.628 --> 42:22.228
It's clouding over. Oh(!)

42:28.388 --> 42:31.828
After what felt like six years,
we came across some civilisation.

42:37.148 --> 42:41.868
Where Richard said he fancied
an all day breakfast in a
good old boys' American diner.

42:42.508 --> 42:44.348
And that gave me an opportunity
to think of another thing

42:44.828 --> 42:46.868
we weren't supposed to do...to do.

42:49.548 --> 42:51.428
All our cars have keyless go,
so providing you have the key

42:52.028 --> 42:55.108
about your person, somewhere near
the car, the engine will start.

42:55.948 --> 42:58.268
I think, however, that dodgers
are a bit crude.

42:59.628 --> 43:01.268
So, Hammond's sitting there, OK?
He's got the keys in his pocket.

43:01.868 --> 43:04.108
He'll know he's left it open.
I don't have his key.

43:07.468 --> 43:08.748
OK, ready?

43:13.708 --> 43:16.068
I'm going to re-park it. I'm not
sure how far I can actually

43:16.668 --> 43:19.628
drive before the engine
realises there's no key.

43:20.868 --> 43:24.908
But I think if I put it... I
don't know, about here. Perfect.

43:27.548 --> 43:29.788
Sorry.

43:31.508 --> 43:36.868
With that factual test completed,
we enjoyed a light breakfast
and chatted about our road trip.

43:37.948 --> 43:39.468
How much are you looking
forward to Bonneville?

43:40.068 --> 43:42.308
More than I've looked
forward to anything, ever.

43:43.628 --> 43:44.668
HORN TOOTS

43:45.308 --> 43:46.708
I've wanted to go there
since I was a small boy.

43:47.188 --> 43:48.348
TOOT!

43:49.668 --> 43:51.188
I'm going to buy a Corvette
when I get to England. You won't.

43:51.788 --> 43:54.388
'It was time to hit the road.'

43:55.228 --> 43:58.188
Onwards! Is that ...?
My car was there and now it's there.

43:58.948 --> 44:02.388
Did you leave it there?
No, of course I didn't leave it
in the road!

44:02.988 --> 44:04.588
I've got the...
I'd go and get it if I were you.

44:05.188 --> 44:06.468
How the...?

44:08.628 --> 44:09.828
TOOT! TOOT!

44:10.388 --> 44:13.028
Oh God, I'm sorry. Sorry!

44:17.228 --> 44:18.388
That's weird.

44:21.788 --> 44:25.948
Back on the I50, I rechecked
my stitching. 18, 19, 20.

44:26.908 --> 44:29.628
21. And James carried on moaning.

44:32.268 --> 44:33.788
..isn't a proper
American luxury car.

44:34.428 --> 44:36.388
This is some sort
of ridiculous American...

44:39.388 --> 44:40.348
At the end of the I50,

44:43.348 --> 44:45.188
there's another very
straight road to Bonneville.

44:45.828 --> 44:47.948
But Richard and I
decided it would be more

44:49.268 --> 44:53.668
fun to go there through the longer,-
twisting road through the mountains.

44:55.868 --> 44:59.508
So we'll go that way.
Why can't we just go there?

45:00.148 --> 45:02.988
Look, James, Cadillac has
never heard of Germany, OK?

45:03.748 --> 45:07.508
Despite that, this car has been
around the Nurburgring
in less than eight minutes.

45:08.388 --> 45:10.228
It's supposed to be the fastest
four-door saloon ever.

45:10.868 --> 45:13.828
On those twisting roads,
you'll love it.

45:17.228 --> 45:21.708
And, you know what?
On this astonishing road, he did.

45:23.868 --> 45:24.668
Hee-hee-hee-hee!

45:25.908 --> 45:28.028
All of a sudden, that stuff about
limited slip differentials

45:28.788 --> 45:33.268
and magnetic suspension...
all makes complete sense.

45:34.708 --> 45:35.988
Oh, yes!

45:36.988 --> 45:38.268
It's so planted.

45:43.588 --> 45:46.868
This is the best American
car I've ever driven.

45:47.468 --> 45:50.108
By a distance as great as that road.

45:53.108 --> 45:59.188
The lighter, grippier Corvette,
however...moves even better.

46:02.068 --> 46:03.228
Man, this is great.

46:04.908 --> 46:08.468
How can a car as docile as this one-
is most of the time

46:09.228 --> 46:12.668
be this exciting when the road gets
twisty? How is that possible?

46:16.028 --> 46:18.868
It's also such a joy to have all
this power and all this handling

46:19.388 --> 46:23.628
and a proper manual gearbox,
not those stupid flappy panels.

46:25.948 --> 46:29.148
Simple traction control on or off.

46:30.828 --> 46:32.748
Are you listening, Ferrari?

46:34.548 --> 46:39.428
Well done, fat man from Kentucky.
This is a masterpiece!

46:45.948 --> 46:48.388
Here in the mountains,
James and I have discovered we

46:51.188 --> 46:52.108
weren't really driving point
and squirt muscle cars.

46:52.588 --> 46:55.428
We were in full on sports cars.

47:00.148 --> 47:03.508
Richard, on the other hand, was
driving a traditional muscle car.

47:04.068 --> 47:07.388
And he wasn't having
quite such a good time.

47:08.988 --> 47:11.588
The Challenger's not really
very good at this sort of thing.

47:12.588 --> 47:15.388
The steering though, is...numb,
actually. It's quite numb.

47:17.188 --> 47:20.988
Meanwhile, back at the front,
something amazing was happening.

47:21.468 --> 47:23.588
This is just a tremend...
Oh, my God, look at this.

47:24.068 --> 47:25.948
I just got overtaken!

47:26.588 --> 47:28.668
Sorry, mate, but you're
spoiling the view ahead slightly.

47:29.148 --> 47:30.348
Now, that won't do.

47:33.948 --> 47:34.988
What's got into him?

47:37.388 --> 47:39.148
Try and keep up, Jezza.

47:39.788 --> 47:42.988
He is really shifting now,
Captain Slow.

47:44.068 --> 47:47.228
This was way too exciting
for the US government.

47:49.668 --> 47:52.988
And, anyway, we had to reach
Bonneville before nightfall.

47:53.588 --> 47:57.028
So we rejoined the main highway
and went for it.

48:10.868 --> 48:14.028
I just wanted to make sure that
you guys were doing the documentary.

48:14.548 --> 48:17.868
It is a documentary. It's not
like a fooling around show, no.

48:18.828 --> 48:22.868
A serious show. 'Jeremy's
sincerity wasn't convincing.

48:23.468 --> 48:26.548
'And his hand gestures
didn't help either.'

48:27.268 --> 48:28.348
Everything you said.

48:28.788 --> 48:30.708
Everything you said made it worse.

48:31.148 --> 48:32.348
At one point, I wanted to just...

48:32.948 --> 48:34.708
Look, did I tell him we were
doing a factual documentary?

48:35.348 --> 48:39.828
There's going to be no issues.
What's really alarming is, you've
actually been quite entertaining.

48:40.668 --> 48:41.628
I wasn't entertaining.

48:42.468 --> 48:45.628
No, I found you entertaining.
Yeah, you were. I was being factual!

48:50.588 --> 48:53.668
After that, we drove on
in a factual manner,

48:54.188 --> 48:55.948
excited that soon we
would be in Bonneville,

48:57.228 --> 48:59.588
the mecca of speed.

49:00.428 --> 49:01.628
And it really is a pilgrimage.

49:02.388 --> 49:05.108
I mean, for a petrol head,
that is hallowed ground.

49:20.708 --> 49:21.508
We woke up the next morning,

49:22.148 --> 49:23.628
having spent the night
in our rented Winnebago,

49:23.908 --> 49:26.348
on the salt flats themselves.

49:35.548 --> 49:38.588
Caused by global-warming about
15,000 years ago,

49:51.188 --> 49:56.748
Keen to become one of those speed
freaks, I was up extremely early.

49:57.268 --> 49:59.148
Now, as we know,
practice makes perfect.

49:59.628 --> 50:00.708
So I'm going to get some practice

50:01.308 --> 50:03.388
now before the course
opens, in the 'Bago.

50:07.028 --> 50:09.628
Clarkson! What? I know it's you.

50:10.588 --> 50:11.748
What are you doing?

50:12.388 --> 50:16.148
We're up to 40mph in the 'Bago.
Come on! I was asleep.

50:16.788 --> 50:18.668
Where's May?
Pack it in! I'm on the throne!

50:19.348 --> 50:20.548
Clarkson, it's not funny!

50:24.108 --> 50:25.788
Clarkson, you infantile pillock!

50:26.828 --> 50:28.148
You're tidying that up.

50:32.388 --> 50:37.228
At nine, the event began and
we immediately bought
some hats so we'd blend in.

50:39.308 --> 50:40.188
Morning.

50:40.948 --> 50:43.308
Then it was time for
our safety briefing.

50:44.348 --> 50:45.668
On a run, if a car has a problem,

50:46.548 --> 50:49.828
they blow up an engine, or catch
fire, they turn out to the right

50:50.588 --> 50:52.708
and we know immediately
to send the fire truck.

50:53.388 --> 50:54.428
So we go right if we have
a problem? Correct.

50:55.348 --> 50:58.268
If we go left, spinning wildly,
that doesn't mean we
haven't had a problem.

50:59.148 --> 51:01.348
It just means we haven't
been able to go to the right.

51:02.548 --> 51:03.948
Our challenge was simple...

51:04.548 --> 51:08.708
To see what speed we could achieve
as we went past the mile marker.

51:11.028 --> 51:13.908
I'm not leaving here until
I've achieved 170 miles an hour.

51:14.708 --> 51:15.988
150 is my target for that.

51:16.588 --> 51:20.028
150. 160.
50, 60, 70. Right, gentlemen.

51:22.468 --> 51:25.908
On a mile-long run on tarmac, our
cars would hit those speeds easily.

51:26.988 --> 51:30.668
But on salt,
that's a very different story.

51:32.508 --> 51:35.188
There's a top coat of tiny crystals.

51:36.628 --> 51:40.348
You kind of float over 130. You
start floating around a little bit.

51:40.948 --> 51:43.308
It's slicker. The surface responds
differently to the tyres.

51:43.788 --> 51:44.628
Does it slide about?

51:45.228 --> 51:47.228
Sometimes. Depends on how
much horse power you put down.

51:47.668 --> 51:49.108
425, what will happen then?

51:49.668 --> 51:51.468
You'll spin out. OK.

51:52.788 --> 51:54.788
You'll spin out? So what am
I going to do at 640 horsepower?

51:55.388 --> 51:57.868
You're gonna have to be
awfully careful.

51:58.868 --> 52:00.988
It was time for our first runs.

52:03.988 --> 52:07.188
Create havoc and let's slip
the dogs of war!

52:11.548 --> 52:14.268
They probably think that's
a Bon Jovi lyric here.

52:18.108 --> 52:19.668
OK, here we go.

52:21.548 --> 52:24.388
Come on now, baby. This is your
territory. This is what you do.

52:24.868 --> 52:26.668
Just that little bit more.

52:30.468 --> 52:32.388
Oh, that was a bad start.

52:33.108 --> 52:35.228
A bit of shaking.
Bit of wobble. Come on, car.

52:39.548 --> 52:40.868
One mile!

52:41.468 --> 52:42.868
There we go.

52:46.348 --> 52:47.628
'Course is clear.'

52:48.108 --> 52:49.628
All of us were too slow.

52:51.308 --> 52:53.908
166. 157. 142.

52:54.628 --> 52:56.508
That's not... No, I know.

52:58.668 --> 52:59.468
To reach our targets,

53:00.108 --> 53:02.828
we'd have to get the wheel spin
off the line exactly right.

53:03.308 --> 53:04.948
Every gear change exactly right.

53:05.788 --> 53:08.028
We'd have to get our line
in the salt exactly right.

53:08.668 --> 53:10.988
Every bit of the run
would have to be perfect.

53:12.428 --> 53:14.068
And that's a tall order for us lot.

53:15.148 --> 53:16.108
BLEEP the limiter.

53:19.188 --> 53:20.148
BLEEP the limiter.

53:21.068 --> 53:22.388
No, this is hopeless.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.228
166.

53:27.708 --> 53:29.268
153. Ignoring that one.

53:30.308 --> 53:32.908
Come on, come on...

53:33.388 --> 53:35.308
Oh no, I misdrove!

53:36.268 --> 53:38.868
It's going to be worse, no!

53:39.588 --> 53:40.988
This is so irritating.

53:41.828 --> 53:42.628
Oh BLEEP!

53:45.388 --> 53:47.868
144. 157.

53:48.348 --> 53:50.268
Missing the gear cost me three mph.

53:52.108 --> 53:54.428
It just doesn't work
with the traction control off.

53:55.148 --> 53:56.908
That was a complete cock-up.

53:57.508 --> 53:59.508
That was hopeless.
I'm going backwards.

54:01.068 --> 54:03.908
144 again.

54:06.588 --> 54:08.308
In the midst of all this
disappointment though,

54:09.188 --> 54:12.148
the little red Corvette
achieved something amazing.

54:12.948 --> 54:16.308
Well, you've got the fastest run
we've ever clocked on these clocks.

54:17.908 --> 54:20.708
Most people would be pleased to
break a record for production cars...

54:21.908 --> 54:25.508
Damn damn damn damn damn damn damn!

54:26.708 --> 54:30.868
But Jeremy was still shy
of his 170 mph target.

54:31.348 --> 54:33.948
They call this salt fever when you
become so obsessed...

54:35.188 --> 54:41.708
that you can think of nothing
but going faster and
faster and faster. Sod it!

54:42.428 --> 54:44.828
Even Captain Slow was infected.

54:45.268 --> 54:49.068
Oi! Have you met James, middle
name queue barger? I like this game.

54:49.828 --> 54:53.748
To help us find more speed,
Jeremy and I pumped our tyres up.

54:58.228 --> 55:03.428
While Richard met an expert who
said he should let some air out.

55:04.508 --> 55:07.108
If you have too much air in the
tyre, the air is actually holding

55:07.748 --> 55:10.468
the pressure held on the side wall
so the tyre can't grow.

55:11.788 --> 55:14.388
I'm really pinning my hopes on that
guy being one of those sort of

55:15.028 --> 55:16.868
mystic gurus of the flats.
They exist.

55:21.028 --> 55:25.628
Jeremy and I lined up
for another run with our tyres
bulging at 50 psi.

55:26.868 --> 55:32.228
Warning notices all over
my dashboard and I'm ready to rock!

55:36.108 --> 55:39.748
Good gear change there. Didn't
hit the rev limiter this time.

55:40.628 --> 55:43.348
Come on, stretch it,
stretch it, stretch it.

55:45.468 --> 55:47.228
162. 164. 165.

55:49.508 --> 55:51.028
169.

55:51.508 --> 55:53.508
Half-a-mile an hour to go.

55:57.148 --> 55:58.788
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

55:59.748 --> 56:02.028
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

56:05.028 --> 56:05.828
159.

56:06.428 --> 56:08.788
Oh, God! I can't do it.

56:10.948 --> 56:13.428
It had been close, but no banana
for Jeremy and James.

56:14.348 --> 56:16.748
So now, watch and learn.

56:19.428 --> 56:23.668
That's a much better start.
It's gonna work.

56:24.788 --> 56:29.308
Come on, Challenger. Think of
the glory, think of the honour.

56:34.028 --> 56:37.308
Ha-ha-ha! 130...? What's that?
I can't read it.

56:38.268 --> 56:40.068
139.

56:41.508 --> 56:44.108
It was afterwards, when we were
making the front of my car more

56:46.068 --> 56:49.268
streamlined, that I learned
a bit more about my salt guru.

56:49.868 --> 56:51.508
How much of your life
have you spent on the flats?

56:52.108 --> 56:53.748
This is my first time on the salt.

56:58.068 --> 56:59.388
OK.

57:00.228 --> 57:01.988
Still, he was pretty
good with Sellotape.

57:02.588 --> 57:05.068
So, with my grill sealed over
and my tyres pumped up,

57:05.908 --> 57:07.788
I set off for another run.

57:13.308 --> 57:15.068
Snaky start. Snaky start. Come on.

57:15.708 --> 57:19.708
Oh no, a bit of tape's gone.
I can't press the pedal any harder.

57:22.028 --> 57:25.148
Come on, come on, keep climbing,
keep climbing, keep climbing.

57:29.468 --> 57:33.548
Do you have a knife I can borrow?
There you go, Challenger - breathe.

57:34.348 --> 57:35.988
With my tyres pumped up
to the point of exploding,

57:36.788 --> 57:38.708
I set off after Hammond.

57:43.388 --> 57:45.508
Forward into the pages of history!

57:48.068 --> 57:49.908
Synchro's getting
a bit weak on second.

57:52.428 --> 57:53.988
153...4.

57:55.028 --> 57:57.068
Come on, stretch it, stretch it.

58:01.028 --> 58:02.308
Come on, 'Vette.

58:07.468 --> 58:10.348
Ooooh, I don't know.

58:11.268 --> 58:14.268
Ha ha ha! I didn't expect that.

58:14.708 --> 58:17.468
I've done it. 150.02. What?

58:18.668 --> 58:20.428
Just this second, that last run.

58:21.028 --> 58:22.468
You've done it? I've done it.

58:23.508 --> 58:25.668
Look, 150.02. What have I just done?

58:26.148 --> 58:27.068
Let's see.

58:27.668 --> 58:29.788
176.549. No?

58:34.628 --> 58:37.308
So, could Slow make it
three out of three?

58:39.708 --> 58:40.788
Come on.

58:42.228 --> 58:44.108
Quick change.

58:44.708 --> 58:46.828
Come on, come on, come on.

58:48.508 --> 58:50.788
176 miles an hour.

58:51.228 --> 58:53.308
I got 150 from my Challenger.

58:53.708 --> 58:56.588
I've ruined it, obviously.

58:57.188 --> 58:59.068
Come on.

59:02.908 --> 59:04.588
Please let that be it.

59:06.628 --> 59:08.748
Was it a good run?
Felt like it. Sir?

59:09.308 --> 59:11.108
163. Yes!

59:12.228 --> 59:14.308
We've all done it.
Has Hammond done it?

59:14.788 --> 59:16.068
Hammond's done 150.

59:16.788 --> 59:18.788
Fantastic. He's celebrating
in the honey bucket. Hammond!

59:19.508 --> 59:20.788
Hammond!

59:21.388 --> 59:23.188
What? He did it. What, 160? Yes.

59:23.788 --> 59:25.988
163. Hey, we've all hit our target!

59:26.628 --> 59:29.828
We were ambitious and, for the
first time ever, successful.

59:31.628 --> 59:34.988
We've never been good at anything
before. And, we've been factual.

59:35.948 --> 59:39.868
Our success though was not the
biggest surprise on this trip.

59:41.068 --> 59:44.028
We came here wondering
if America had finally

59:44.868 --> 59:49.268
made a car that might actually
work in the civilised world.

59:49.988 --> 59:51.548
The answer is no, they haven't.

59:54.788 --> 59:59.068
As you can see from our smiles,
they've made three.

01:00:08.428 --> 01:00:09.868
APPLAUSE AND CHEERS

01:00:10.668 --> 01:00:12.348
They were, all three, just great.

01:00:12.988 --> 01:00:16.028
They were. I reckon my Vette was
better than that Renault twingo.

01:00:16.548 --> 01:00:18.748
I'd rather have the Challenger. Yes.

01:00:19.388 --> 01:00:20.988
Perhaps they're not quite
as well made as we'd like.

01:00:21.628 --> 01:00:25.188
No, but they were just
fantastic fun. We just love them.

01:00:27.388 --> 01:00:29.748
And on that Obama shell,
it's time to end the show.

01:00:30.348 --> 01:00:33.548
Thanks very much for watching.
See you next week. Good night.

01:00:47.948 --> 01:00:50.788
