00:06.306 --> 00:07.773
<i>Previously on</i> Rogue...

00:07.775 --> 00:09.809
Just making sure.

00:09.811 --> 00:11.310
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is this?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.179
You took a risk, saying
those drugs were yours.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.346
So you don't
believe me, do you?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.681
So, roommate to roommate,

00:15.683 --> 00:17.183
- were they your drugs?
- No.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.919
<i>Were they Jack's?</i>

00:19.921 --> 00:21.754
<i>The cops probably planted</i>
<i>it on him or something.</i>

00:21.756 --> 00:23.489
<i>Jack's gonna propose.</i>

00:23.491 --> 00:25.191
Marlon's gonna be
a big ass businessman.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.259
You his nigga, Marlon.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.928
His mandingo
slave boy.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.098
Hutchings was a reporter,
chasing a story.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.166
This is what
they do.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.468
What is that?

00:36.470 --> 00:38.559
- It's urban art.
- No, what is that?

00:40.340 --> 00:42.775
That. Is that something
on the lens?

00:42.777 --> 00:43.843
General Howard's building
a case against you.

00:43.845 --> 00:46.345
What?

00:46.347 --> 00:48.214
<i>It feels personal,</i>
<i>like he wants to embarrass you.</i>

00:48.216 --> 00:50.549
So what's this all about?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.522
I'm First Lieutenant
Ethan Kelly.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.787
I killed three US Marines.

00:54.789 --> 00:57.823
Only a crazy man walks into
the US Attorneys' office and confesses.

00:57.825 --> 01:00.659
We gotta tell the whole story
from A to Z.

01:00.661 --> 01:04.629
- AJ set up a meeting with my team and the DOD.
- Who did you meet with?

01:04.632 --> 01:06.498
<i>A Lloyd Roberts, special aide
to the office of General Lance Howard.</i>

01:06.500 --> 01:08.868
Roberts is General Lance
Howard's right-hand.

01:08.870 --> 01:10.402
<i>Could be looking at</i>
<i>corruption that reaches</i>

01:10.404 --> 01:12.538
to the highest levels of the
<i>us military.</i>

01:12.540 --> 01:14.506
They're gonna start to think
that it must've been

01:14.508 --> 01:17.076
Howard and Roberts who
conspired to steal that money.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.879
<i>What about Roberts?</i>

01:19.881 --> 01:23.249
<i>They're gonna find</i>
<i>a nice, little surprise at his house.</i>

01:23.251 --> 01:26.151
Marty, you could have saved yourself a trip.
We have a full confession on videotape.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.354
Ethan Kelly, you are
under arrest for murder.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.321
You have the right
to a lawyer.

01:29.323 --> 01:31.954
I am his
fucking lawyer!

02:36.990 --> 02:39.158
Excuse me.

02:39.160 --> 02:40.960
You came in.
Now, get out!

02:40.962 --> 02:43.595
One minute. I'm heading back
to Chicago forthwith,

02:43.597 --> 02:46.966
so I will get to
the point, Donna.

02:46.968 --> 02:50.602
I don't think you've thought
through the ramifications of your decision.

02:50.604 --> 02:54.807
I know Ethan Kelly rots in jail
for murder if I tell the truth.

02:54.809 --> 02:55.874
I'm good.

02:59.446 --> 03:02.681
If Ethan Kelly goes down, then
your husband, your kids' father,

03:02.683 --> 03:05.751
goes down too. Again.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.354
"Your daddy's a murderer."

03:08.356 --> 03:10.456
That will follow
your kids wherever you go.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.681
Get out of my house.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.627
You don't stick
to our agreement,

03:15.629 --> 03:18.297
every parent, every teacher,
every student in that school

03:18.299 --> 03:21.300
will know about you,
your husband and your kids.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.801
I will see to it.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.801
I will make
it my hobby.

03:24.836 --> 03:26.672
And I promise you,

03:26.674 --> 03:29.875
this stink will follow you wherever you go,
wherever you try to hide,

03:29.877 --> 03:32.260
however far away you run.

03:34.047 --> 03:37.022
- You're disgusting.
- Yes, I'm a lawyer.

03:49.696 --> 03:51.418
Okay!

03:52.499 --> 03:54.837
Little powdered sugar,

03:55.702 --> 03:57.972
and for the
piece de resistance.

03:59.272 --> 04:00.339
Perfect.

04:04.110 --> 04:05.477
Perfect?

04:05.479 --> 04:07.091
- Meh.
- Meh?

04:08.214 --> 04:10.282
So,

04:10.284 --> 04:13.452
mom says you're having trouble with your
history project. You want some help?

04:13.454 --> 04:14.886
You can't help me.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.022
I know my history.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.024
Dad, I signed a letter
promising no outside help.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.793
They'll throw me out of the school.

04:21.795 --> 04:22.894
They're not gonna
throw you out of the school.

04:23.963 --> 04:24.763
Eat.

04:28.301 --> 04:30.135
Lloyd Roberts?

04:30.137 --> 04:33.308
- Yes, how can I help you?
- We have a warrant to search the premises.

04:34.974 --> 04:38.043
- Who is it?
- It's just work stuff, sweetie.

04:38.045 --> 04:39.511
Do you have any
firearms on the premises?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.714
Yeah, in a gun vault.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.689
What's all this?

04:50.690 --> 04:52.532
I have no idea.

05:12.846 --> 05:16.148
Kelly, you got a visitor.
Open number four.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.985
Turn around.
Face the wall.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.753
Arms behind your back.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.040
How are you?

05:46.379 --> 05:48.614
Could use a
decent meal.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.450
- I'll smuggle you in a sandwich.
- Hmm.

05:51.452 --> 05:54.453
I met with a shrink for three hours
yesterday. Make sure I wasn't crazy.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.207
- You're not. Clearly.
- Hmm.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.743
So how long
you figure this part is?

06:00.460 --> 06:02.794
Depends. They have a
lot to work through.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.464
They're gonna have
to go through their process.

06:05.466 --> 06:07.566
- They find the money?
- In process.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.067
What about Donna?
She do her part?

06:09.069 --> 06:10.102
- She will.
- But she hasn't yet.

06:10.104 --> 06:11.929
She will.

06:13.306 --> 06:15.140
You could've
confessed anywhere.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.142
Marty knew that
Cynthia Richmond

06:17.144 --> 06:19.818
would fully vet this
because she needs the win.

06:20.747 --> 06:23.106
She's vain.
It's her weakness.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.750
What's yours?

06:25.785 --> 06:27.653
Men in uniform.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.116
You gotta trust Marty.

06:35.628 --> 06:37.899
Do I have any
other choice, Sophie?

06:37.934 --> 06:39.675
Hang in there.

06:52.878 --> 06:53.845
So, I'm thinking,

06:54.647 --> 06:55.547
for dinner,

06:56.916 --> 06:58.283
some lamb chops.

06:58.285 --> 06:59.951
And,

06:59.953 --> 07:03.154
maybe, a nice,
grilled salmon,

07:03.156 --> 07:06.791
some kinda Pesto dish and a very special
Cabernet. You can go to the basement.

07:06.793 --> 07:10.261
- I'll handle it. How'd it go with Donna?
- Oh, God. Coin flip.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.998
Well, it all comes down to her.
I hope you didn't fuck it up.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.133
God damn it. This is going to
be a good dinner party.

07:15.135 --> 07:16.501
Well, it's certainly
one way to play it.

07:16.503 --> 07:18.169
And one more thing.

07:18.171 --> 07:21.673
Yes, if Marco's has fresh oysters,
I'll get a couple dozen.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.908
- Marry me.
- I thought you'd never ask.

07:23.910 --> 07:26.077
- And Miss Betsy?
- Yes?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.212
These eggs are terrific!

07:40.693 --> 07:42.661
Lloyd?

07:42.663 --> 07:44.496
That's my daughter's bed, guys.
Come on, please!

07:45.599 --> 07:48.667
Is this really necessary?
This is an honest home!

07:48.669 --> 07:50.618
Just let 'em do their thing.

07:50.698 --> 07:53.144
And then we're gonna bill
them for the fucking damage.

07:53.145 --> 07:54.770
Call General Howard.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.375
- I can't, not yet.
- Why not?

07:57.377 --> 08:00.340
I'm not exactly in his good books
right now. I will deal with this.

08:02.314 --> 08:03.715
Daddy?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.884
Sweetheart, stay downstairs.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.750
- Lloyd, this is insane! - Gentlemen,
you're not going to find anything here.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.857
- Honey?
- Okay, sweetie, it's gonna be okay, all right?

08:13.893 --> 08:15.393
Everything's gonna be fine.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.109
Now, what's this?

08:18.464 --> 08:20.055
You sons of bitches.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.675
- Take her to our room, now. Now!
- Oh...

08:23.736 --> 08:25.637
Daddy!

08:25.639 --> 08:27.572
It's not my money.
You know that.

08:27.574 --> 08:29.841
You're gonna put your
hands behind your back?

08:49.762 --> 08:51.896
Kinda nice having the place to
ourselves for a change, huh?

08:51.898 --> 08:52.797
Yeah.

08:56.168 --> 08:58.236
I just want to let you know
how much it means to me,

08:58.238 --> 08:59.304
you letting Vin stay here.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.173
It's no problem.

09:06.345 --> 09:07.679
Okay. So, what's up, then?

09:09.548 --> 09:11.883
Don't think that I can't tell
when something's up.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.518
It's nothing.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.455
C'mon, talk to me,
don't shut me out.

09:20.459 --> 09:21.326
Uh...

09:28.901 --> 09:29.868
I found the ring.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.705
Wha... what?

09:33.707 --> 09:35.173
In your shoe,
in the closet.

09:38.477 --> 09:41.541
Okay, well, this wasn't exactly
how I planned to propose.

09:42.715 --> 09:43.548
Sorry.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.718
What were you doing
going through my stuff?

09:48.154 --> 09:50.645
I was looking for drugs.

09:52.725 --> 09:54.371
Jesus.

09:55.327 --> 09:58.296
Because of the coke, right?
I already told you.

09:58.298 --> 10:00.526
That wasn't mine.
I told you that.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.745
But you don't trust me.

10:04.970 --> 10:07.572
After all this time, you still
don't fucking trust me.

10:09.408 --> 10:11.409
Why...

10:11.411 --> 10:13.945
Once an addict,
always an addict. Is that it?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.014
- That's not it.
- Then what is it?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.516
It's my issue, Jack, okay.

10:18.518 --> 10:20.151
I have to figure it out for myself.

10:20.786 --> 10:22.754
Okay.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.923
We can... we'll take
a step back then.

10:24.925 --> 10:26.341
I mean, you just got
shot at, for Christ sake.

10:27.447 --> 10:28.193
It's not yourself.

10:28.195 --> 10:30.261
You know what
getting shot at did?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.997
It just... like it just,
brought everything into focus, you know?

10:32.999 --> 10:35.333
It just made it really
fucking clear. What I want,

10:37.203 --> 10:39.003
and what I don't want.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.271
Yeah, but that's good.

10:41.774 --> 10:42.974
You should take
some time off work.

10:42.976 --> 10:46.110
Get your head straight.
We could go away.

10:46.112 --> 10:47.779
We can go up to my
brother's cabin and...

10:51.116 --> 10:52.684
I can't marry you, Jack.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.020
We won't get married, then.

10:56.022 --> 10:57.555
I mean, that was
a stupid idea. We...

11:00.392 --> 11:01.359
It's over.

11:02.494 --> 11:03.628
I'm sorry.

11:34.894 --> 11:35.827
They found
the money.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.595
Roberts was arrested.

11:37.597 --> 11:39.931
Good.
How's Ethan holding up?

11:40.733 --> 11:41.499
Not sure.

11:42.434 --> 11:43.768
Not sure?

11:43.770 --> 11:45.136
It's a lot of pressure.

11:47.072 --> 11:48.706
What about Donna?

11:48.708 --> 11:50.541
The US attorneys are supposed
to sit down with her soon.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.632
So, we'll see.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.880
Oddsmakers say,
Ethan is going to get fucked.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.110
Yeah. Is that
what you want?

11:58.617 --> 12:00.251
What I want?

12:02.756 --> 12:07.192
What I want is to see General
Lance Howard fall down very hard.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.441
If Ethan walks,
it's a nice little extra.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.574
- There's our Talia.
- On time.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.810
- I see that. Gonna be a night tonight!
- All right.

12:25.812 --> 12:26.611
Thanks, guys.

12:32.484 --> 12:33.384
That was yours.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.565
- Talia?
- It's nothing.

12:47.567 --> 12:49.434
Looks like something.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.803
I walked into my closet door.
It was late.

12:51.805 --> 12:53.171
I didn't have my lights on.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.572
It's fine. Seriously.

13:29.775 --> 13:31.275
- Hey!
- Hey.

13:31.277 --> 13:32.677
What's up?

13:32.679 --> 13:35.013
- Did you call?
- Yeah.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.147
- But uh...
- Ah!

13:36.149 --> 13:37.115
Had the phone off.

13:37.649 --> 13:38.616
Sorry.

13:39.718 --> 13:40.752
Everything okay?

13:41.387 --> 13:43.054
Yeah.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.722
I could just really
use someone to talk to.

13:45.524 --> 13:47.588
Oh. Yeah.

13:47.826 --> 13:48.693
Sure.

13:58.904 --> 14:01.550
Wow, Paddy,
this place is uh...

14:01.551 --> 14:03.881
- Yeah...
- It's pretty neat.

14:06.311 --> 14:08.880
I didn't know we had company.

14:11.650 --> 14:12.984
Harper, this is Lily.

14:13.719 --> 14:15.553
Lily, Harper.

14:15.555 --> 14:17.722
I've heard so
much about you!

14:17.724 --> 14:18.289
Hi!

14:21.360 --> 14:24.195
- Yes, nice to finally meet you.
- Yeah!

14:24.197 --> 14:26.497
I'm so... I didn't mean
to interrupt.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.666
Oh, no, are you kidding? I was just
gonna open a beer, do you want one?

14:29.334 --> 14:30.735
Uh...

14:30.737 --> 14:32.737
Sure, yeah,
that would be...

14:32.739 --> 14:35.673
Actually, if you have anything
stronger, that would be great.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.408
- I think we do.
- Yeah, we got stronger...

14:37.910 --> 14:38.776
Cool.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.129
- So?
- So...

14:58.131 --> 14:59.864
Don't the soup spoons
go on the left?

14:59.866 --> 15:01.299
We're not having soup.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.633
Then why the soup spoons?

15:02.635 --> 15:05.269
Never let your guests
know what's coming.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.039
If you take away the soup spoons,
they know there's no soup.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.042
What is that, a Chinese metaphor
for conquering Tibet?

15:11.044 --> 15:13.544
Instructions to the board game.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.962
Don't stop now, Marty. Pass go and
collect your two hundred dollars.

15:18.383 --> 15:21.152
And don't go to jail.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.888
Ah! There she is!

15:23.890 --> 15:28.593
Beauty is like a rock.
It stands the test of wind and storms.

15:28.595 --> 15:29.660
Stop it, stop it, General.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.963
Oh, excuse me.
Come on in.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.831
This way, old man!

15:33.833 --> 15:35.666
So glad we're
finally doing this.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.001
Long time coming.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.894
- Hello, Marty.
- Hi.

15:39.304 --> 15:40.505
- What's the occasion?
- Marty?

15:42.441 --> 15:45.309
I just need to speak to
Betsy for one second.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.245
Dinner timing is critical.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.281
Betsy,
table looks magnificent!

15:50.283 --> 15:51.916
- Well?
- The office called. No word yet on Donna.

15:53.585 --> 15:54.919
Fuck him.

15:54.921 --> 15:56.787
Who said Betsy
did the table?

15:56.789 --> 15:57.989
Come on, come on,
sit, sit, sit.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.957
It's terrific!

15:59.959 --> 16:03.127
Man, muscles on top
of muscles on top of muscles!

16:03.129 --> 16:06.531
- Speaking of which...
- Lynn, you look lovely, as usual.

16:06.533 --> 16:08.933
- Thank you. - I haven't seen
your boy, Ethan, in a while.

16:08.935 --> 16:12.003
He goes AWOL from time to time.
Wow!

16:12.005 --> 16:15.640
Look at this, huh?
Fabulous, right?

16:15.642 --> 16:19.325
- Everything all right?
- Wellfleets, blue points, some kumamotos.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.511
You concerned?

16:21.046 --> 16:23.210
No.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.617
- What are we celebrating?
- We are celebrating you.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.486
A, because you're beautiful,

16:28.488 --> 16:31.856
and B, you have been putting
up with this bum for too long.

16:31.858 --> 16:35.893
- Well, I'd argue with you but you know...
- Okay, okay, wise guy...

16:35.895 --> 16:39.397
We are going to send you away on
an all-expenses stay in Bali

16:39.399 --> 16:42.633
where you will be a free woman,
far away from the long arm of the army.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.502
No more, "Yes, sir," and "No, sir,"
and "Whatever you want, sir."

16:44.504 --> 16:46.370
Marty?

16:46.372 --> 16:48.539
- A toast to freedom!
- Toast to freedom!

16:48.541 --> 16:50.975
I like that.

16:50.977 --> 16:54.212
And Lynn, I may follow you to the islands
and sweep you away myself.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.846
- Marty.
- Marry me, Betsy,

16:55.848 --> 16:57.915
before I ruin this man
by stealing his woman.

16:57.917 --> 17:00.885
He'd never be the same.
He'd be down for the count.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.155
Stripped of medals. Buttons ripped
from his shiny buff uniform.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.290
Naked on the street with a
shopping cart and a tin cup!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.561
Doesn't sound so bad.
Fresh start.

17:11.564 --> 17:15.124
Don't tempt me, Marty,
change is the heart of life.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.501
Marty, may I
have a kumamoto?

17:17.502 --> 17:20.404
Yes, of course, sweetheart.

17:20.406 --> 17:24.617
- You're feeling spunky.
- Spunky? Spunky's a word for chipmunks.

17:24.742 --> 17:26.544
I'll get the salad.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.013
The wellfleets may
change all that.

17:29.015 --> 17:33.823
But I am going to
try one nonetheless.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.255
Cheers.

17:40.692 --> 17:43.728
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.097
Bourbon soda and the bud
to six, kamikazes table four.

17:46.099 --> 17:46.998
Thanks.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.204
Bourbon and soda and a bud.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.212
Hey!

18:05.917 --> 18:08.319
Oh, no, no, no.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.553
You must have been in the
bathroom when they ordered.

18:09.555 --> 18:10.755
Yeah, is that okay?

18:10.757 --> 18:13.090
- You're 21?
- Yeah, I'm 21.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.959
- Lemme see your ID.
- Jesus.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.602
- There's no way you're 21.
- Oh my God. I'm 21, okay?

18:24.604 --> 18:28.306
See? That's a driver's license
that says I'm 21.

18:28.308 --> 18:30.574
- Bitch.
- What did you just call me?

18:32.944 --> 18:36.947
What the fuck
did you just call me?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.449
Hey, wait, what's the problem?
What's the problem?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.484
Your waitress
thinks I'm not 21.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.385
Mmm, lemme see.

18:42.020 --> 18:42.853
Hey.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.757
It's legit.

18:46.759 --> 18:48.595
It's legit.

18:52.964 --> 18:55.166
When you have a chance,
I'll have another, thank you.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.001
Yeah. Coming right up.

18:57.003 --> 18:59.505
- Come here. Come here.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

19:00.505 --> 19:02.306
I want you to switch
tables with Julie, okay?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.642
I don't want you
to get into it with her.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.745
All right, but I'm telling you,
I don't need this shit today.

19:20.525 --> 19:23.861
What can you tell us about the relationship
between Ethan Kelly and your husband?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.063
They were very close.

19:28.233 --> 19:30.234
Did Ray talk to you about
what happened in Pakistan?

19:34.039 --> 19:37.891
- Mrs. Williams?
- Yeah, sure.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.244
What did he tell you?

19:42.814 --> 19:45.758
Penalty for perjury
includes prison.

19:51.757 --> 19:53.424
What the fuck!

19:53.426 --> 19:55.192
What difference
does it make now? He's dead.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.527
I'm sorry?

19:56.529 --> 19:59.230
My husband, Ray?
He's dead!

19:59.232 --> 20:02.578
Official police records list your
husband as missing, not dead.

20:03.502 --> 20:05.869
He's not missing.

20:06.505 --> 20:08.406
Do you know something
that we don't, Mrs. Williams?

20:09.875 --> 20:12.815
I know my husband.
I know Ray.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.914
The only thing
that would keep him

20:18.450 --> 20:21.603
away from me
and our kids...

20:23.355 --> 20:25.315
What happened
in Pakistan?

20:25.390 --> 20:28.054
Pakistan was a mess.

20:29.094 --> 20:31.173
His boss

20:32.264 --> 20:35.032
sent the boys to stop some
guys from stealing money.

20:36.368 --> 20:37.701
And then what happened?

20:41.706 --> 20:43.844
I can't lie.

20:45.243 --> 20:46.377
There was an accident.

20:47.245 --> 20:48.679
What kind of accident?

20:54.753 --> 20:56.819
They killed some Marines.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.724
Boss said they didn't
do anything wrong.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.359
Like that was supposed to
make them feel better.

21:03.995 --> 21:06.158
Do you believe that story?

21:08.133 --> 21:09.633
Fucking war.

21:09.635 --> 21:10.801
What it did to them.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.206
When he came back,

21:15.607 --> 21:17.814
he was different. He was...

21:19.311 --> 21:21.297
There was something
in his eyes.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.181
So, you didn't
believe what he told you?

21:24.616 --> 21:26.330
I did,

21:28.053 --> 21:33.670
until that fucker from the Pentagon showed
up at my door after Ray disappeared.

21:35.260 --> 21:36.918
Who was that?

21:39.431 --> 21:41.806
I don't remember his name.

21:45.637 --> 21:46.837
Robert, something.

21:48.507 --> 21:51.464
- Lloyd Roberts?
- Yeah.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.944
Yeah, Roberts.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.724
From the Pentagon.

22:01.353 --> 22:04.054
He paid me off

22:04.056 --> 22:06.357
to keep my mouth shut about
what had happened over there.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.359
And I have. Until now.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.189
Of course.

22:14.499 --> 22:17.442
You don't pay someone off
unless there's something really wrong.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.659
Do you still have
that money?

22:20.639 --> 22:22.297
What do you think?

22:24.242 --> 22:26.721
I have two girls.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.486
Am I going to jail?

22:35.420 --> 22:38.022
I really should've
married you, Betsy.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.424
But then again, I have all the
benefits and none of the heartache.

22:40.426 --> 22:42.693
And the best lamb chops.
The best goddamn lamb chops!

22:42.695 --> 22:43.928
Another glass of the Cab.

22:45.497 --> 22:47.531
Another glass
of Cab for the lady.

22:47.533 --> 22:48.933
- Betsy?
- Mmm-mmm.

22:48.935 --> 22:50.334
<i>Amigo por de vida!</i>

22:50.336 --> 22:52.002
Shit. Go ahead. Pour.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.370
That is my friend
of 50 years.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.440
Hair on his chest
and more on his balls.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.309
We'll follow with the Michter's
when we retire to the den.

23:00.278 --> 23:03.280
<i>- Amigo por de vida.</i>
<i>- Amigo... por de vida.</i>

23:03.282 --> 23:05.049
Friends for the vitamins?

23:05.051 --> 23:08.252
Friends for life, sweet thing.
Friends for life.

23:08.254 --> 23:10.054
Until we make our move
to Bali, that is.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.555
Confucius.

23:11.557 --> 23:14.258
"Have no friend
not equal to thyself."

23:14.260 --> 23:15.893
But then again,
he was confused.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.362
"A true friend stabs
you in the front."

23:18.364 --> 23:21.398
- True 'dat. True 'dat.
- Lynn, please.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.301
Oscar Wilde.
Poor thing.

23:24.303 --> 23:29.206
"May God be praised for woman,
that gives up all her mind.

23:29.208 --> 23:32.776
A man can find in no man,
a friendship of her kind."

23:32.778 --> 23:35.479
Lance recited that to me
the night before your wedding.

23:35.481 --> 23:37.481
Ah! He probably had a whiskey
in his hand, you know.

23:37.483 --> 23:39.984
You give an irishman whiskey
and out pours yeats.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.052
All I know is that you took
my best buddy from me!

23:43.555 --> 23:45.389
The best decision
I ever made.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.124
Come on, Lynn.
We'll get the coffee.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.359
You boys behave.

23:58.003 --> 24:00.437
Well, Monte and a Michter's.

24:00.439 --> 24:01.939
Like the old days.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.907
- I've given them up.
- Oh, don't be daft.

24:03.909 --> 24:06.110
We'll be dead by next Thursday
the way we're going.

24:08.581 --> 24:09.913
Might as well enjoy
the last few miles.

24:12.083 --> 24:13.951
You have a fair point.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.854
Your dad used to smoke
those White Owls, remember?

24:16.856 --> 24:19.089
Yeah, we stole a couple and
smoked them in a park.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.858
You threw up for an hour.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.427
- Nasty things.
- Cheap and nasty.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.863
Your dad used to chomp on them
all day long like GI Joe.

24:25.865 --> 24:28.198
That he did.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.768
Always in the basement. Cutting and
chopping and chomping and smoking.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.336
Your dad too.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.104
Those non-filtered cigarettes.

24:34.106 --> 24:36.122
Back when men were men.

24:36.775 --> 24:39.026
The lives our dads had.

24:40.945 --> 24:42.920
The lives our dads had.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.885
You took him to a museum?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.220
- Kicking and screaming.
- Hey, I got culture.

24:50.222 --> 24:51.288
Really?

24:52.691 --> 24:54.458
You're gonna gang up
on me now?

24:54.460 --> 24:56.160
Well, that's too easy.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.127
Right?

24:58.697 --> 25:01.231
So how'd you two meet?

25:01.233 --> 25:03.067
- Well, six months ago...
- No, it wasn't that long.

25:04.402 --> 25:05.736
Tuesday will be
six months, baby.

25:06.738 --> 25:08.338
- Really?
- Yeah!

25:08.340 --> 25:11.208
- Wow!
- Anyway,

25:11.210 --> 25:14.845
- I was just leaving the United Center...
- Bulls fan! That's good.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.313
Actually, I'm a cheerleader.

25:18.217 --> 25:20.217
Paddy, you think he'd
mention something like that...

25:20.219 --> 25:22.419
Lily also goes to school.

25:22.421 --> 25:25.422
Grad school, actually,
Romantic poetry.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.157
- You should hear Paddy...
- No fucking way.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.526
He read Wordsworth to his mom.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.829
- You have a mom?
- She didn't understand a word

25:31.831 --> 25:34.431
- but I'm sure she liked it.
- You have a mom.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.834
You know, losing your memory
like that, I just...

25:36.836 --> 25:38.001
I couldn't even imagine.

25:41.606 --> 25:42.673
I gotta get a beer.

25:54.753 --> 25:58.188
He's a good son, your partner.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.391
I mean, that place he's got his
mother in must cost a fortune.

26:04.028 --> 26:05.362
Yeah, you know what,
I should be going.

26:10.468 --> 26:12.736
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah. No, I'm fine.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.471
Are you sure?

26:14.473 --> 26:16.240
Maybe, maybe
you shouldn't be driving.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.541
Why don't you just stay here?

26:23.782 --> 26:26.917
I thought he was a God,
my old man.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.052
Out-foxed the evil,
perfidious Europe.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.588
He was odysseus
but he never went home.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.424
From another world.

26:34.426 --> 26:37.561
Made a life,
built a business, raised a family

26:37.563 --> 26:39.730
and man, could he kick
a soccer ball!

26:39.732 --> 26:42.132
My old man could kick my ass
until the day he died.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.234
And yours.
Same time.

26:44.236 --> 26:46.470
- Had to more than once.
- Well, we gave him good cause.

26:46.472 --> 26:49.606
That we did.
That we did.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.643
And one day, I come home from school
and there he is, lying on the couch.

26:52.645 --> 26:54.611
You know,
with his arm over his eyes,

26:54.613 --> 26:57.514
like he used to snore.
I don't know, I was 11.

26:57.516 --> 26:58.682
He was a good man.

26:58.684 --> 27:00.984
That's my point, Lance.
That's my point.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.086
Here he is...
lying on the couch,

27:03.088 --> 27:06.790
and noise coming out of him,
like, I don't know, some asthmatic bear...

27:06.792 --> 27:09.259
And that's the moment
I realized he's just a guy!

27:10.929 --> 27:12.863
He's just a guy!
Like any other guy.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.432
He comes home.
He eats. He sleeps.

27:15.434 --> 27:19.137
And at the age I am now,
he's been dead for 40 years.

27:20.672 --> 27:23.880
- You're getting up there, old friend.
- You're right there with me.

27:24.442 --> 27:27.277
You got a date or something?

27:27.279 --> 27:31.015
You know, you're the only one
I still talk to, after all these years.

27:32.350 --> 27:34.451
How did we last this long?

27:35.119 --> 27:35.953
Yeah.

27:37.188 --> 27:39.990
We're lone wolves, you and I.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.559
All those people, they get
replaced by other people,

27:42.561 --> 27:44.494
I forget their names
an hour after I meet them.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.863
Like passing gnats
on a highway.

27:45.865 --> 27:46.797
But you and me,

27:48.299 --> 27:50.095
all this time.

27:52.070 --> 27:53.911
Coffee and sweets for anyone?

27:54.672 --> 27:56.528
Thanks, I'm stuffed.

27:57.475 --> 27:59.142
Sophie called, said everything
worked out fine.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.917
<i>Amigo por de vida.</i>

28:08.820 --> 28:10.053
We have history, amigo.

28:12.257 --> 28:16.026
Yes, we do...

28:16.028 --> 28:19.730
- So why are you trying to fuck me?
- Excuse me?

28:19.732 --> 28:23.233
Sending Ethan Kelly to sniff
around my laundry basket.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.902
You asked me to
find you someone.

28:24.904 --> 28:27.070
Yes, I did.
Why him?

28:27.072 --> 28:28.405
Because he's in
your back pocket?

28:28.407 --> 28:30.440
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.910
What did you expect
to find, Lance?

28:32.912 --> 28:35.779
- Are you serious?
- Serious, yeah. Pretty fuckin' serious.

28:35.781 --> 28:39.049
You know what? You're paranoid!

28:39.051 --> 28:42.019
History, amigo.
History! History! History!

28:42.021 --> 28:44.701
Do not try to bullshit me!

28:47.091 --> 28:48.725
Kelly told me everything.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.460
- He's lying!
- Lying?

28:50.462 --> 28:53.931
Lying about what, Lance?
Lying about what?

28:53.933 --> 28:56.199
Come on, he's a criminal,
he's, he's lost.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.268
He's an empty shell.
And you know that.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.771
Well, he's found himself now.

29:00.773 --> 29:03.774
Right now, as we speak, he's
downtown with the federales.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.976
Son of a bitch
turned himself in.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.744
And you wanna know
what he's doing now, Lance?

29:07.746 --> 29:09.246
You're gonna love this.

29:09.248 --> 29:11.615
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

29:11.617 --> 29:14.418
He's sitting in the US Attorneys' office,
telling them quite a tale.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.054
And you and that little
cock-sucking prick who works for you

29:17.056 --> 29:19.623
are the central characters of
this little story, Lance.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.293
Murder, cover-ups,
millions of taxpayer dollars.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.014
Quite a tale!

29:27.265 --> 29:29.433
I don't know, I guess he just
couldn't live with himself anymore.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.300
I guess.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.696
Good cigar, no?

29:47.251 --> 29:48.051
God!

30:02.301 --> 30:04.835
You're born alone.
You die alone.

30:04.837 --> 30:07.537
And in between,
try not to get fucked

30:07.539 --> 30:09.706
by those who pretend
to be the closest to you.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.476
They all come
after me, Lance.

30:12.478 --> 30:17.314
The SCC, the IRS, the FBI, the EPA,
every agency in this state!

30:17.316 --> 30:19.816
Half the bar associations
across this country.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.818
And guess what, Lance?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.553
I'm still here.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.055
"I am still here!"

30:27.558 --> 30:30.327
Who was that?
Stephen Sondheim? Good song.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.697
They come after me. I get it.
It's three dimensional chess. I am the king.

30:33.699 --> 30:34.631
But you...

30:35.533 --> 30:36.400
Lance.

30:37.168 --> 30:37.968
You.

30:38.736 --> 30:39.803
Amigo.

30:42.540 --> 30:43.807
Make me understand.

30:47.578 --> 30:49.921
Your client, Sam Beuker,

30:50.381 --> 30:53.573
is selling arms
to enemies of the US.

30:54.852 --> 30:55.819
And?

30:58.322 --> 31:00.867
Jesus!

31:01.426 --> 31:04.561
He sells
steel internationally!

31:04.563 --> 31:07.731
I personally cleared every deal with
the Department Of State.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.266
I know what
you're doing, Marty.

31:09.268 --> 31:10.901
When I represented him,
that is.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.206
- You don't represent him anymore?
- No, I don't, General.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.814
Uh-oh, no tracers.

31:22.280 --> 31:24.514
You don't
represent him anymore!

31:25.783 --> 31:27.851
He's selling arms.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.854
Legal, schmegal.
Let's just say that's so. So what?

31:30.856 --> 31:33.890
Long view, General,
long view!

31:33.892 --> 31:36.359
- I know what you're doing, Marty.
- Would that were true,

31:36.361 --> 31:39.029
I would think that you would be
the first one to watch my back!

31:39.031 --> 31:40.297
Would that were true.

31:40.299 --> 31:42.065
It's treason.
And illegal.

31:42.067 --> 31:44.367
What is, exactly, General?

31:44.369 --> 31:46.870
I don't see any uniform.

31:46.872 --> 31:49.906
Unless those argyle socks are supposed
to represent the stars and bars.

31:49.908 --> 31:54.144
1948, my uncle Mo flew F-16
Falcons in Israel. Illegal!

31:54.146 --> 31:58.448
1941, American flying Tigers
fought in China. Illegal!

31:58.450 --> 32:03.053
1986, American civilians
helped fund the Mujahideen

32:03.055 --> 32:06.156
which directly took
down the Soviet Empire!

32:06.158 --> 32:10.813
Uh-oh. Illegal. And also,
by the way, patriotic.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.663
I'm a little bit
confused here, General.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.859
What the fuck is your point?

32:17.401 --> 32:18.768
I'll let it go, hero.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.885
Yeah, fuck!
Let it go. Let it go!

32:22.607 --> 32:24.641
Doesn't exactly
sound like it, General.

32:24.643 --> 32:26.810
Besides which
you are way off base,

32:26.812 --> 32:30.514
and you're a blind man
shooting blanks.

32:30.516 --> 32:32.616
Your defense of the hypothetical
is impressive, nonetheless.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.378
Hypothetical, General.
Key word.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.587
How did we get here, Marty?

32:49.133 --> 32:50.433
Remember that
weekend in Vegas?

32:50.435 --> 32:51.835
Like it was last week.

32:53.505 --> 32:55.472
- Mindy and Stacey.
- Mindy and Stacey.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.275
- Mindy was cuter.
- Stacey was sexier.

32:58.277 --> 33:00.343
We were busted
for being 17.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.945
And busted for
being broke.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.847
I told ya to stay away
from the craps table.

33:03.849 --> 33:07.017
One more good run, baby.
One more good run!

33:07.019 --> 33:09.352
And, so it goes.
My dad came and bailed us out.

33:09.354 --> 33:10.720
- Again.
- Again.

33:10.722 --> 33:11.721
- Cleared our records.
- Again.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.623
Again, indeed.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.824
Otherwise, you don't
go to law school.

33:14.826 --> 33:16.226
And you, West Point.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.799
He warned me
about you, you know.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.569
He said, "That Stein kid,
he's quite a kid. But he's trouble."

33:25.571 --> 33:28.905
Like the music man said,
"He's trouble, Lancelot."

33:28.907 --> 33:31.241
"And in the long run

33:31.243 --> 33:32.809
he'll take his own mother down
and give it a passing thought."

33:35.079 --> 33:38.081
My dad treated you
like his own son.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.380
You were the last person
he ever expected to fuck him.

33:43.721 --> 33:47.857
- Excuse me?
- Shady Green.

33:47.859 --> 33:52.329
Sure, it was just
a fart in a windstorm to you, huh?

33:52.331 --> 33:56.366
Condo building. Florida.
600 miles from civilization.

33:56.368 --> 34:00.237
- You're kidding me, right?
- No, I'm serious. I'm pretty fucking serious.

34:00.239 --> 34:03.273
Wow.

34:03.275 --> 34:06.209
This whole thing is over
a fucking tax shelter?

34:06.211 --> 34:09.446
He wrote it off eight-to-one.
He made money on the deal!

34:09.447 --> 34:12.415
Sure he did, Marty,
until 10 years later

34:12.417 --> 34:15.418
and the IRS disallowed
every one of those write-offs.

34:15.420 --> 34:17.420
Over taxes owed,
interest in penalties...

34:17.422 --> 34:19.688
You invest, you take a risk.
He was a big boy.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.625
My point, Machiavelli,
my point.

34:21.627 --> 34:24.293
He had all the
write-offs he needed.

34:24.295 --> 34:27.297
He only bought the
damn thing to help you.

34:27.299 --> 34:29.953
You got your fee.
He ended up bankrupt.

34:32.203 --> 34:33.937
- What are you doing?
- Do you ever wonder

34:33.938 --> 34:36.739
what goes through a man's head
when everything is taken from him?

34:36.742 --> 34:39.895
It doesn't happen right
away or all at once,

34:40.610 --> 34:43.380
but his chin hung
down to his tits.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.782
He grew bags under his eyes
and wrinkles on his wrinkles.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.951
He lost 40 pounds.

34:47.953 --> 34:52.389
He was 58 years old
and he looked 90.

34:52.391 --> 34:56.659
Dying was the best thing
that ever happened to him.

34:56.661 --> 35:00.830
Why didn't he come to me? I had plenty of money.
Why didn't you come to me?

35:00.832 --> 35:04.000
Because you were like a son.
You betrayed him for a buck.

35:04.002 --> 35:05.835
You broke his heart.

35:05.837 --> 35:08.638
- That's what you think?
- Come on.

35:08.640 --> 35:11.441
I've seen you destroy people
and walk away.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.511
Hiding your head
in your hubris, your ambition,

35:14.513 --> 35:16.579
or your money or whatever the
hell puts you to bed at night.

35:17.748 --> 35:18.748
Okay.

35:21.019 --> 35:23.478
What does this have to do
with the sky being blue?

35:23.621 --> 35:25.522
You're dangerous, Marty.

35:25.524 --> 35:27.716
More than you even know.

35:29.027 --> 35:33.630
I made a life stopping your kind, no
matter what flag they were waving.

35:33.632 --> 35:36.966
You're off the fucking plot.
In every possible way.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.269
From every possible angle.

35:39.271 --> 35:42.472
I'm gonna stop you, Marty.
I'm gonna ruin you.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.374
Don't get even
more stupid on me.

35:44.376 --> 35:48.178
I'm gonna humiliate you,
like you humiliated him.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.947
I'm gonna watch
while you lose all of this,

35:50.949 --> 35:53.950
and spend the last of your days
alone in a fucking prison cell,

35:53.952 --> 35:55.285
your chin hanging
down to your tits.

35:57.489 --> 36:02.959
Every investigation into you so far has
failed because you had no one on the inside.

36:02.961 --> 36:05.161
But then, you gave me a gift.
You wanted someone to plug your leak.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.296
I gave you Kelly.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.869
We do what we gotta do.

36:12.871 --> 36:15.438
I'm gonna beat this, Marty.
And I'm gonna beat you, old friend.

36:18.309 --> 36:20.243
- You think so?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:20.245 --> 36:22.078
You don't get
to play God anymore.

36:23.981 --> 36:26.810
Hmm. Maybe.

36:28.486 --> 36:29.953
Maybe not.

36:32.022 --> 36:33.089
They're here.

36:34.992 --> 36:36.159
Who's here?

36:38.396 --> 36:40.230
What we could have
done together, General.

36:42.566 --> 36:45.602
What the hell
is going on?

36:45.604 --> 36:49.101
You know me, Lance.
You know me better than anyone.

36:49.673 --> 36:52.869
I'd do anything,
anything at all,

36:53.711 --> 36:56.304
that puts me to
bed for a good night's sleep.

37:11.262 --> 37:12.529
General Howard.

37:14.366 --> 37:18.234
You're under arrest for conspiracy
to commit murder and grand larceny.

37:24.308 --> 37:25.442
Lance!

38:06.183 --> 38:07.250
I know you're awake.

38:19.363 --> 38:20.230
Paddy,

38:22.033 --> 38:26.302
you tell me about some girl you spent two
hours with in the back of a Toyota...

38:29.841 --> 38:33.710
...but you neglect to tell me you're
living with a charming, young poetry major

38:33.712 --> 38:36.045
in a black and red tutu?

38:36.047 --> 38:39.910
- She's a grad student.
- Like I give a fuck.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.852
You really think
she's charming?

38:45.489 --> 38:47.690
I tell you when Jack
pisses on the seat.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.859
And that's the fuckin'
highlight of my day.

38:49.861 --> 38:50.927
Fuck you.

38:55.866 --> 38:58.675
Maybe I was looking
to keep the door open.

38:59.203 --> 39:01.538
Don't be an asshole.

39:01.540 --> 39:03.306
Tell me you never
thought about it.

39:07.144 --> 39:09.245
Why would you
fuck with my head right now?

39:09.247 --> 39:10.480
I just broke up
with my boyfriend.

39:11.982 --> 39:14.984
Look, it's probably
none of my business,

39:14.986 --> 39:18.488
but this probably has nothing
to do with Jack, anyway.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.391
Some pisspot shot at you.
You shot back.

39:21.393 --> 39:25.562
Now, the pisspot, he's dead.
So maybe you feel an anger.

39:25.564 --> 39:29.766
Fear and, I don't know, guilt?
It's normal.

39:29.768 --> 39:32.635
It sucks.
That's all I know. It sucks.

39:34.705 --> 39:39.348
Even if the guy deserved
to be worm food, it still sucks.

39:42.480 --> 39:46.149
You're right,
it's not Jack. I mean, he's...

39:53.958 --> 39:57.689
My dad died 20 years ago
and I still want his approval.

39:59.730 --> 40:00.797
Stupid?

40:02.766 --> 40:04.367
The past's a motherfucker.

40:06.236 --> 40:07.937
I visit my mom once a week.

40:08.973 --> 40:10.640
She doesn't even
know my name.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.645
But I stand there like a fuckin'
asshole, waiting for her to say it.

40:21.719 --> 40:24.754
She doesn't even fuckin'
like me very much.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.423
She's got three fuckin' exes.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.059
Four kids. I'm the only fucker
who goes and visits.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.566
You can trust me, Paddy.

40:39.136 --> 40:41.304
That's what my dad says
about choosing a guy.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.373
He says, without trust
it all goes to shit.

40:46.276 --> 40:49.345
He was a pretty big deal
back in Vilas County.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.514
- Oh, yeah?
- Sheriff Big Terry Deakins.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.720
23 years on the job, then he, then
he takes a bullet right here.

40:58.656 --> 41:00.901
Can't lift a fork after that.

41:02.426 --> 41:05.294
They gave him the watch.

41:05.296 --> 41:09.098
Then, like a year later, he tells me
he's going fishing with his buddies.

41:10.768 --> 41:13.369
Instead, he goes
to Oneida County,

41:13.371 --> 41:16.425
puts Johnny Cash on the tape
player and a bullet in his brain.

41:18.275 --> 41:21.110
- Shit.
- Yeah.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.546
The fuckin' guy crosses
the county line

41:23.548 --> 41:25.448
so he's not a burden to the
guy who takes over his job.

41:27.484 --> 41:28.918
That's the gun he used.

41:32.022 --> 41:33.556
'Cause that's normal.

41:37.595 --> 41:40.963
That reminds me when things get
shitty, I've got a way out.

41:43.001 --> 41:47.303
I know it was his life and he can do
whatever the fuck he wanted with it,

41:49.206 --> 41:50.139
but I trusted him,

41:53.477 --> 41:55.545
and he left me. Yeah.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.394
You gonna tell me
about that shiner?

42:11.396 --> 42:13.262
It's nothin'.

42:13.264 --> 42:16.065
Anybody can hit a lady.
Only a real asshole does it.

42:17.201 --> 42:19.402
- Nobody hit me.
- Right. Right.

42:19.404 --> 42:22.630
It was, slipped in the shower.
No, no, it was the door.

42:24.174 --> 42:28.110
My advice,
whoever he is, dump him.

42:29.413 --> 42:30.847
You're too good
for the asshole.

42:33.684 --> 42:34.617
Yeah?

42:36.453 --> 42:37.186
You know,

42:39.022 --> 42:39.922
I was just,

42:43.227 --> 42:46.429
I was just tryin' to do something
good for me, you know?

42:48.599 --> 42:49.999
But everything's about him.

42:51.902 --> 42:55.037
Always about him.

42:55.039 --> 42:56.706
I mean, when you get right
down to the bottom line,

42:59.610 --> 43:02.912
none of this would've
happened if not for him.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.013
Bastard shouldn't
have hit you.

43:06.083 --> 43:06.983
Know what?

43:11.455 --> 43:13.489
You're right.

43:13.491 --> 43:14.724
Fuck him.

43:14.726 --> 43:16.492
Right. Fuck him.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.431
Look, you wanna go home,
I can close instead.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.966
- No, I'm good.
- You sure?

43:23.968 --> 43:25.835
- Yeah.
- Okay.

43:26.737 --> 43:27.837
All right.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.441
Don't forget to lock
that back door behind you.

43:32.443 --> 43:33.409
- Mmm.
- Night.

43:33.411 --> 43:34.744
Night.

44:46.250 --> 44:47.283
Oh, my God.

44:56.426 --> 44:57.660
Oh, my God.

46:09.733 --> 46:11.400
Harper Deakins.

46:14.538 --> 46:18.300
Okay, yeah.
Um, I will meet you there.

46:29.586 --> 46:30.519
What?

46:31.588 --> 46:33.422
Uh, yeah, send him in.

46:39.863 --> 46:42.531
- What? No white flag?
- Cynthia.

46:42.533 --> 46:45.167
- Hell of a story your client's selling.
- Happens to be true.

46:45.169 --> 46:47.036
Yeah, you wouldn't know
"true" if it bit you in the ass.

46:47.038 --> 46:48.371
Maybe just coincidence.

46:48.373 --> 46:49.839
I'm not here
about anything Kelly.

46:49.841 --> 46:52.274
- Really?
- General Howard.

46:52.276 --> 46:54.176
Oh, he's in this
up to his eyeballs.

46:54.178 --> 46:57.680
Let's focus. What's important
is that you've got your John Gotti,

46:57.682 --> 47:00.483
your Bernie Madoff. General Howard
is your ticket to Washington

47:00.485 --> 47:02.985
or a seven-figure
white-shoe gig.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.641
- Is that so?
- Tell me I'm wrong.

47:06.424 --> 47:08.057
Well, lucky for me, the man was
involved in three murders...

47:08.059 --> 47:10.860
Lucky for him,
you can't prove it.

47:10.862 --> 47:13.029
Roberts wouldn't scratch his
ass without Howard's okay.

47:13.031 --> 47:15.565
Roberts' ass is what you
should be aiming at.

47:15.567 --> 47:17.634
General Howard has
put his ass on the line

47:17.636 --> 47:20.470
for this country,
for a quarter century.

47:20.472 --> 47:23.206
He keeps shmucks like you and me safe
to play our little pissant games

47:23.208 --> 47:25.041
of "guilty" and "not guilty."

47:25.043 --> 47:27.911
- So, I owe him a mulligan?
- Four-star general,

47:27.913 --> 47:30.580
decorated veteran
of two wars.

47:30.582 --> 47:33.616
Bringing a man like him down
is like shooting John Wayne in the back.

47:33.618 --> 47:35.118
We the people,
we will not like it.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.554
God bless John Wayne.

47:37.556 --> 47:39.889
Hearts and minds.
Let's start with our own.

47:39.891 --> 47:42.091
From Pennsylvania Avenue
to the blue-haired lady

47:42.093 --> 47:45.094
who stamps your
speeding tickets "Paid."

47:45.096 --> 47:47.230
The one thing that keeps the
wheels of this country spinning

47:47.232 --> 47:49.065
is the faith that it works.

47:49.067 --> 47:51.768
Works today, works tomorrow
and the day after.

47:51.770 --> 47:56.195
You go ahead with this,
you put one more chink in that faith.

47:56.230 --> 47:58.188
The speech over?

47:58.843 --> 48:00.944
I rest my case.

48:00.946 --> 48:02.946
So I should let a murderer go
because it's good for America?

48:02.948 --> 48:05.748
Alleged murderer.

48:05.750 --> 48:08.084
And he's a ruined man,
as we speak.

48:08.086 --> 48:12.622
I know this first-hand. I want
this albatross flying in his wake.

48:12.624 --> 48:16.704
Put him in orange pajamas, it's
like throwing a rock at a coffin.

48:18.863 --> 48:22.432
If, and I use
this word pointedly,

48:22.434 --> 48:25.435
if I were to put
my patriot hat on...

48:25.437 --> 48:29.806
The General will resign
his post and quietly retire.

48:29.808 --> 48:32.133
Well, you know,
that would be a gift.

48:33.777 --> 48:37.947
So I save America, what's in it for me?
I can't wait to hear this.

48:37.949 --> 48:42.986
He gives you Lloyd
Roberts on a silver platter.

48:42.988 --> 48:44.487
I get a knight
instead of a king?

48:44.489 --> 48:47.318
And a chance to
play with the masters.

48:48.459 --> 48:52.570
I'm sure you're aware I have
half of DC on speed dial.

49:00.571 --> 49:03.946
- What about those guys
in white shoes? - Them too.

49:07.878 --> 49:10.505
And I'm guessing
Ethan Kelly gets exonerated.

49:10.540 --> 49:12.415
Collateral consequence.

49:12.417 --> 49:15.577
- He goes on the record tomorrow.
- You drop the charges today.

49:18.756 --> 49:21.324
Thank you.

49:21.326 --> 49:25.528
Marty, tell me, no bullshit,
what's the General got on you?

49:25.530 --> 49:29.261
50 years. And an IOU.

49:36.540 --> 49:38.942
<i>The truth</i>
<i>is on our side.</i>

49:38.944 --> 49:41.778
<i>If we just tell them what really happened
in Pakistan, we're gonna be fine.</i>

49:41.780 --> 49:43.446
Can't do that.

49:43.448 --> 49:45.048
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

49:45.050 --> 49:47.450
<i>I've been offered a deal.</i>
<i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

49:47.452 --> 49:49.385
You don't need a deal.

49:49.387 --> 49:51.754
<i>Big picture,</i>
<i>what have we done wrong?</i>

49:51.756 --> 49:54.424
<i>Kelly and his friends,</i>
<i>they're the bad guys here.</i>

49:54.426 --> 49:57.337
<i>They stole the money.</i>
<i>They're the ones who killed the Marines.</i>

49:57.372 --> 49:58.600
- It won't work, Lloyd.
- What?

49:58.635 --> 49:59.924
<i>Why?</i>

49:59.959 --> 50:01.554
<i>You murdered two people.</i>

50:02.967 --> 50:04.801
<i>On your orders.</i>

50:04.803 --> 50:07.136
- Orders?
- Whatever is necessary,

50:07.138 --> 50:10.540
<i>that's what you said.</i>
<i>We had to get Marty Stein.</i>

50:10.542 --> 50:12.575
<i>We had to stop the son of a</i>
<i>bitch and his client</i>

50:12.577 --> 50:15.244
from committing fuckin' treason.
That is what you said.

50:15.246 --> 50:18.305
<i>Going after Marty had nothing</i>
<i>to do with arms dealing.</i>

50:19.783 --> 50:22.919
<i>- Excuse me?</i>
<i>- It was just an excuse.</i>

50:22.921 --> 50:27.016
<i>It was my own petty war.</i>
<i>It was personal. I lied to you.</i>

50:30.060 --> 50:34.330
You're a righteous man, Lloyd.
I knew you needed a cause.

50:34.332 --> 50:39.068
<i>Personal? I murdered two</i>
<i>fucking people for personal?</i>

50:39.070 --> 50:41.571
<i>You should be in here, not me.</i>

50:41.573 --> 50:43.640
Like I said, I cut a deal.

50:43.642 --> 50:48.277
You cut a fucking deal,
you son of a bitch!

50:48.279 --> 50:50.446
- Come on.
- I've a wife and a kid.

50:50.448 --> 50:53.149
You think, you think I'm gonna
shut my fuckin' mouth,

50:53.151 --> 50:55.613
you cock sucker!

51:11.168 --> 51:14.396
I'm good, thanks.

51:20.444 --> 51:24.280
- How's your day going?
- Not bad.

51:24.282 --> 51:27.383
Well, it's about to get
a little bit better.

51:28.618 --> 51:30.186
Richmond bought the story?

51:30.188 --> 51:31.988
With an assist
from General Howard.

51:31.990 --> 51:35.591
- You're kidding me.
- He confirmed everything you told her.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.827
- And filled in the grout.
- Regarding Roberts?

51:37.829 --> 51:40.629
That cue ball prick's going
away forever, and then some.

51:40.631 --> 51:43.432
I thought General Howard
is your target.

51:43.434 --> 51:47.151
Yeah, well, best laid schemes
of mice and men.

51:47.838 --> 51:49.505
They're gonna release
you, conditional

51:49.507 --> 51:53.209
upon you helping them with
their prosecution of Roberts.

51:53.211 --> 51:55.868
- So, that's it?
- Fat lady's warmed up and ready.

52:00.217 --> 52:04.268
- I owe you.
- Yes, you do.

52:05.322 --> 52:07.857
Get changed, pal.
You are going home.

52:10.360 --> 52:11.527
You're a free man.

52:13.296 --> 52:16.027
What are you gonna do now?

52:49.266 --> 52:53.536
- Glad you called, Ms. Freeman.
- Sure, Mrs. Officer.

52:53.538 --> 52:55.371
What did you wanna
talk about?

52:55.373 --> 52:57.840
You still wanna deal
on the counterfeit money?

52:57.842 --> 53:00.876
- Where's your lawyer?
- You gonna deal or no?

53:00.878 --> 53:02.745
Depends on what
you have to give me.

53:06.183 --> 53:08.951
How about my brother?

53:08.953 --> 53:13.844
How about I give you Marlon
and my fucking lawyer, Marty Stein?

53:16.793 --> 53:18.933
You want them or not?

53:25.828 --> 53:30.778
