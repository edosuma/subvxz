WEBVTT

00:00.500 --> 00:02.300
Previously onHawaii Five-O...

00:02.600 --> 00:05.000
How's that water, tadpoles?
That toasty enough for you?

00:07.280 --> 00:08.840
JOE:
The Navy SEAL is a man.

00:08.840 --> 00:11.000
A man who would
lay down his life.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.580
A man who will persevere
in the face of adversity.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.890
Life is unpredictable.
Wouldn't you agree?

00:15.890 --> 00:16.740
Yeah, I would.

00:16.740 --> 00:18.890
I mean, I for one
never knew

00:18.890 --> 00:19.890
I had a sister.

00:19.890 --> 00:21.740
How do you know
where my wife is?

00:21.740 --> 00:23.780
What matters is I have
people there right now

00:23.780 --> 00:24.820
waiting to hear from me.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.890
You've made your point, Noriko.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.860
You have six hours

00:27.860 --> 00:28.820
to get me the money.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.820
What else could
you possibly need?

00:30.820 --> 00:32.620
An alibi.

00:32.620 --> 00:35.700
Just had a body wash up
on Ka'alawai Beach.

00:35.700 --> 00:37.420
GSW to the back of the head.

00:37.420 --> 00:39.890
Steve, it's Noriko.
Adam's sister.

00:51.890 --> 00:53.890
Hey, there's my guy!

00:53.890 --> 00:54.890
What's up, buddy?

00:54.890 --> 00:57.060
Hey, boo-boo,
what are you doing?

00:57.060 --> 00:58.300
Hi.
Hey.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.140
You guys have a
nice time together?

01:00.140 --> 01:01.580
My God, it was amazing.

01:01.580 --> 01:03.340
Yeah?
Like, off the charts.

01:03.340 --> 01:03.940
That's awesome.

01:03.940 --> 01:05.900
Well, listen, any time
you want to hang out

01:05.900 --> 01:07.700
with Eddie, you
just let me know.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.890
Noelani, I had no idea
you were so, uh,

01:09.890 --> 01:11.820
you were such a big fan of dogs.

01:11.820 --> 01:13.740
What

01:13.740 --> 01:15.580
Huge fan.

01:15.580 --> 01:17.100
Like, massive.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.660
Big-time.

01:18.660 --> 01:19.820
Huh.

01:20.890 --> 01:21.580
Okay, fine.

01:21.580 --> 01:22.860
Look, there's
this really cute guy

01:22.860 --> 01:23.890
that I see
at the Blue Tree Café

01:23.890 --> 01:26.500
most days before work,
and I always hear him talking

01:26.500 --> 01:28.980
to the barista
about his rescue dogs,

01:28.980 --> 01:30.300
and, well, I needed an in.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.890
Okay, so Eddie
was your wingman.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.860
It's pathetic, right?

01:33.860 --> 01:35.860
No, it's not pathetic.

01:35.860 --> 01:36.860
I won't tell anyone.

01:36.860 --> 01:37.580
Come on

01:37.580 --> 01:40.140
Actually, we're having drinks
in a couple hours.

01:40.140 --> 01:41.740
Boom. So, no.

01:41.740 --> 01:43.890
It's not pathetic,
it's awesome.

01:43.890 --> 01:44.940
I thought, uh, your generation

01:44.940 --> 01:47.500
only met people
on those dating apps.

01:47.500 --> 01:48.060
I'm old-school.

01:48.060 --> 01:50.340
Huh.
Anyway, mahalo
for understanding.

01:50.340 --> 01:51.890
No problem, no problem.
It's good to know

01:51.890 --> 01:54.540
that the Blue Tree's cool
with dogs, I like that place.

01:54.540 --> 01:55.620
Oh, they're not.

01:55.620 --> 01:56.140
I kind of told them

01:56.140 --> 01:58.220
that Eddie was
my emotional support animal.

01:58.220 --> 01:59.660
Okay.
I know it's wrong,

01:59.660 --> 02:00.580
but it's not like I did it

02:00.580 --> 02:02.620
just so I could bring him
on a plane.

02:02.620 --> 02:03.420
Good point.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.780
Well, I should get going.

02:04.780 --> 02:06.340
Still need to go home
and change.

02:06.340 --> 02:07.890
All right.
Good-bye, buddy.

02:07.890 --> 02:09.780
Good work today.

02:09.780 --> 02:11.890
Thank you.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.890
You want to try this?

02:13.890 --> 02:14.660
Yeah?

02:14.660 --> 02:15.890
All right, here you go.

02:15.890 --> 02:18.780
You ready?

02:18.780 --> 02:20.220
Da-da-da, sit.

02:20.220 --> 02:21.780
It's hot, it's hot.

02:21.780 --> 02:22.900
Okay

02:22.900 --> 02:25.660
Hey, if I don't finish mine,
you can have seconds, okay?

02:25.660 --> 02:26.700
JUNIOR: Hey.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.900
Yo.
I just ran into Noelani.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.580
She looks like
she's in a good mood.

02:30.580 --> 02:31.580
Oh, yeah, she met a guy.

02:31.580 --> 02:32.620
Yeah, that'll do it.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.340
Tell you what, man,
another five minutes, and, uh,

02:34.340 --> 02:36.260
you probably would've lost
your steak to the big boy.

02:36.260 --> 02:38.420
JUNIOR: Oh, yeah,
sorry I was late.

02:38.420 --> 02:39.580
I just was looking
at apartments,

02:39.580 --> 02:41.540
I just-- guess I just
lost track of time, so...

02:41.540 --> 02:43.980
You should check this place out,
it's pretty awesome.

02:43.980 --> 02:46.580
You know, it's just
a one bedroom, laundry,

02:46.580 --> 02:47.740
you know, underground parking.

02:47.740 --> 02:49.140
You know,
it's a great neighborhood.

02:49.140 --> 02:49.890
STEVE:
That's very nice.

02:49.890 --> 02:51.890
Very nice, I see
they have appliances.

02:51.890 --> 02:53.380
Yeah.
Ah, that's good, man.

02:53.380 --> 02:55.420
Uh, secured parking--
it's nice.
Yeah.

02:55.420 --> 02:58.580
I didn't... I-I didn't know
you were moving out.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.300
Well... well, not yet.

02:59.300 --> 03:01.890
You know, I still need to apply,
and I might not get it, so...

03:01.890 --> 03:05.420
Oh, just, I mean, I just...
mi casa su casa,you know?

03:05.420 --> 03:06.860
You can stay here
as long as you like.

03:06.860 --> 03:08.580
Of course, uh, of course,
you know, I-I...

03:08.580 --> 03:11.180
I mean, uh, it's not that
I want to leave, I just figured,

03:11.180 --> 03:11.980
at some point, you know...

03:11.980 --> 03:13.980
No, you should, it's good--
good for you, good for you.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.180
I-I never even had
my own place, I, uh...

03:16.180 --> 03:18.580
I went from here to boarding
school, to the Navy,

03:18.580 --> 03:21.180
and then, somehow, I, uh,
I ended up back here again,

03:21.180 --> 03:22.500
so, you know...

03:22.500 --> 03:24.860
Yeah.

03:27.900 --> 03:29.620
It's good.

03:29.620 --> 03:30.740
Hey, you know what?

03:30.740 --> 03:31.820
On second thought, I, uh...

03:31.820 --> 03:34.260
They always say, don't go with
the first thing you see, right?

03:34.260 --> 03:38.580
I mean, uh, there's plenty
of stuff out there, you know?

03:38.580 --> 03:39.860
You think I should keep looking?

03:39.860 --> 03:40.460
Yeah, I would.

03:40.460 --> 03:42.420
It's just, there's a lot
of places-- I just...

03:42.420 --> 03:43.380
Don't sell yourself short.

03:43.380 --> 03:44.890
Yeah, I think
I owe it to myself.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.300
I would, I would.
Mm-hmm.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.260
Okay, all right.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.620
I would.
Hey, uh, you want another beer?

03:49.620 --> 03:51.890
Definitely.
Yeah, I'm gonna
grab another one.

03:51.890 --> 03:54.060
Okay.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.780
STEVE: Hey, Junior,
these are almost done!

04:11.580 --> 04:15.500
Hey, what happened,
we run out of beer?

04:15.500 --> 04:16.890
Junior.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.890
Junior.

04:21.890 --> 04:23.780

I mean...

06:04.300 --> 06:05.460
Why am I here?

06:05.460 --> 06:06.700
There's been a terrible crime.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.980
You mean, the woman
who got stabbed

06:07.980 --> 06:09.100
during the break

06:09.100 --> 06:11.580
You know, the Honolulu
Police Department

06:11.580 --> 06:13.220
investigates such crimes.

06:13.220 --> 06:14.890
I'm not talking
about the murder.

06:14.890 --> 06:16.620
This is a different crime.

06:16.620 --> 06:16.890
Oh.

06:16.890 --> 06:21.700
Oh, and actually,
she was stabbed 13 times.

06:21.700 --> 06:23.890
There was blood
all over the place.

06:23.890 --> 06:25.740
It was likeThe Shiningin here.

06:25.740 --> 06:27.580
But thanks to
Crime Clean,

06:27.580 --> 06:29.060
you could never tell, right?

06:29.060 --> 06:29.980
It's about
to beThe Shining

06:29.980 --> 06:32.700
up in here again
if you don't get to the point.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.780
Better if I show you.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.620
Boom.

06:41.620 --> 06:43.890
What do you mean, "boom"?

06:44.620 --> 06:45.900
Boom.

06:45.900 --> 06:47.300
Two paintings. So what?

06:47.300 --> 06:49.890
So, they're not just
any paintings.

06:49.890 --> 06:51.220
These are old masters.

06:51.220 --> 06:53.180
Part of a collection
that went missing

06:53.180 --> 06:54.700
during World War II.

06:54.700 --> 06:57.890
And it looks like somebody
found 'em. So what?

06:57.890 --> 06:59.890
When I say "went missing,"

06:59.890 --> 07:01.900
it's a synonym for "stolen."

07:01.900 --> 07:03.300
Why don't you just say "stolen"?

07:03.300 --> 07:04.540
Okay. Stolen!

07:04.540 --> 07:06.500
By who?
The Nazis.

07:06.500 --> 07:08.140
Oh.

07:08.140 --> 07:10.020
Oh!

07:10.020 --> 07:12.460
Oh, well...

07:12.460 --> 07:16.890
how'd they end up
in here?

07:19.100 --> 07:20.660
STEVE: Hey.
Commander, hi.

07:20.660 --> 07:22.100
I apologize.
I just got your message

07:22.100 --> 07:23.620
a few minutes ago.
Huh.

07:23.620 --> 07:25.890
I appreciate you coming over.

07:25.890 --> 07:27.220
Oh, sorry. This is Manti.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.940
Howzit?
Manti, this is
Commander McGarrett

07:28.940 --> 07:29.890
and Officer Rey.
Hi.
Hi.

07:29.890 --> 07:31.420
Nice to meet you.
Hey, I'm sorry

07:31.420 --> 07:32.060
to interrupt your night.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.890
Hey, what's a first date
without an unplanned trip

07:33.890 --> 07:35.380
to a total stranger's house,
right?

07:35.380 --> 07:37.220
Right.
Any word on Junior?

07:37.220 --> 07:38.420
No. It's like he just vanished.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.980
Noelani, when you
saw him here earlier,

07:39.980 --> 07:40.980
did he say anything to you?

07:40.980 --> 07:43.820
We chatted for a second.
He was in a great mood.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.820
Said he found an apartment,
and that was it.

07:45.820 --> 07:48.300
Okay. Excuse me. McGarrett.

07:48.300 --> 07:48.900
JUNIOR:
Commander.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.460
Junior. Hey, hey, hey.
Where are you?

07:50.460 --> 07:52.860
Yeah, I'm sorry
for disappearing like that.

07:52.860 --> 07:53.890
Uh, they said there was no time.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.460
What are you talking about?
Who's "they"

07:56.460 --> 07:57.260
I'm in Pearl City.

07:57.260 --> 07:59.890
Uh, a rep from my old SEAL team
came to get me.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.060
I'm being recalled
from the reserves.

08:02.060 --> 08:03.580
He's being deployed.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.460
Okay, understood.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.060
Look, uh, appreciate the call.

08:06.060 --> 08:08.380
Sir, there's something else.

08:08.380 --> 08:09.300
What's that?

08:09.300 --> 08:10.860
The op is a kill
or capture mission

08:10.860 --> 08:13.060
for a high-value target
in Nigeria.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.700
Code name is "Reaper."
Hey.

08:14.700 --> 08:17.890
That's classified information.
Why are you telling me this?

08:17.890 --> 08:19.500
Just listen to me, please.

08:19.500 --> 08:20.500
Their latest intel suggests

08:20.500 --> 08:23.700
that the target's location
has minimal security.

08:23.700 --> 08:24.900
Reaper doesn't want it
to be known.

08:24.900 --> 08:27.660
But there's talk
that they may have hostages

08:27.660 --> 08:28.820
who could become collateral.

08:28.820 --> 08:31.420
One of them is an American
who disappeared last year

08:31.420 --> 08:34.300
while working
as a private contractor.

08:35.260 --> 08:37.140
Sir, they think
it may be Joe White.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.380
I know you two were close,

08:39.380 --> 08:41.740
so I thought I should tell you.

08:41.740 --> 08:43.780
Okay.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.180
Commander Park.

08:55.580 --> 08:56.420
Can I help you?

08:56.420 --> 08:59.100
My name's
Commander Steve McGarrett.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.220
Junior told me about you.

09:00.220 --> 09:03.100
If you've come for him, I'm
afraid the Navy has first dibs.

09:03.100 --> 09:04.890
That's not why I'm here.
Your target

09:04.890 --> 09:06.890
may be holding a former
Navy SEAL commander hostage.

09:06.890 --> 09:08.420
I want to come with you
and bring him home.

09:08.420 --> 09:11.820
First off, how the hell did you
come by that information?

09:11.820 --> 09:12.260
Sir, when a member

09:12.260 --> 09:13.890
of my team
suddenly gets deployed,

09:13.890 --> 09:16.100
you can't blame me
for making a couple of calls.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.620
JUNIOR:
Commander Park,

09:17.620 --> 09:18.540
I called him.

09:18.540 --> 09:20.060
You shared
classified information

09:20.060 --> 09:20.890
on an active mission?

09:20.890 --> 09:22.260
JUNIOR: Yes, sir.
'Cause I knew

09:22.260 --> 09:23.220
if I asked for
your permission,

09:23.220 --> 09:24.380
you'd say no.
You're damn right.

09:24.380 --> 09:26.260
And if we hadn't called you in

09:26.260 --> 09:27.540
because we were short
on personnel,

09:27.540 --> 09:30.020
this would be the fastest
a guy was kicked off an op

09:30.020 --> 09:31.020
in the history of the Navy.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.340
STEVE: All due respect,
Commander Park.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.820
If it wasn't
for Joe White,

09:35.820 --> 09:37.660
I wouldn't even
be a SEAL today.

09:37.660 --> 09:38.740
He trained me.

09:38.740 --> 09:39.860
Sir, he pushed me
through BUD/S.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.380
He was my father when my father
couldn't be there.

09:42.380 --> 09:43.890
If there's even a remote chance

09:43.890 --> 09:46.460
that man is downrange,
I'm gonna find him.

09:46.460 --> 09:47.980
Like hell you are.

09:47.980 --> 09:50.100
This is way too personal

09:50.100 --> 09:50.580
for you.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.060
And besides that,
there's no hard intel

09:52.060 --> 09:54.890
that Joe White
is even on that compound.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.740
Okay.

10:00.220 --> 10:01.220
Then know this.

10:01.220 --> 10:03.540
I'm gonna be right behind
you boys, all right?

10:03.540 --> 10:05.540
I'm gonna be on the next plane
out of here.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.890
I know the region.
I've run 100 ops like yours.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.890
Just know when
you're downrange,

10:09.890 --> 10:11.890
the shadow right behind you,
that's gonna be me.

10:11.890 --> 10:14.940
Okay? So tell your boys
not to shoot me.

10:14.940 --> 10:15.980
McGarrett!

10:15.980 --> 10:17.740
Yes, sir.

10:18.940 --> 10:21.890
All right.

10:21.890 --> 10:23.660
You want in? Fine.

10:23.660 --> 10:25.300
But understand something.

10:25.300 --> 10:27.780
Our mission is Reaper.

10:27.780 --> 10:29.100
If Joe White is on that compound

10:29.100 --> 10:32.860
and doesn't compromise the op,
we'll get him.

10:32.860 --> 10:36.140
But do not forget the priority.

10:36.140 --> 10:37.900
Those are my orders.

10:37.900 --> 10:39.940

Yeah, I like to think if I got
kicked out of the reserves,

to fall back on.

My leg's broke.
I thought it might be.

13:21.620 --> 13:23.940
We started taking fire
on the float down.

13:23.940 --> 13:26.740
And when I touched down,
you were still in the air.

13:26.740 --> 13:28.900
You had to ditch
from 50 feet up.

13:28.900 --> 13:30.500
Crashed through a tree.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.940

13:31.940 --> 13:34.580

Yeah, it's out.

13:46.890 --> 13:47.890
Well, that's good.

No. We're gonna make it

14:18.060 --> 14:18.890
CEO of Crime Clean.

Hi.
Oh, and on the DL,
Five-O's top C.I.

14:22.100 --> 14:25.020
:
Nice to meet you.
Yeah.

14:25.020 --> 14:26.180
Kono mentioned it, huh?

14:26.180 --> 14:28.940
You really expect me to believe
that you two are still in touch?

14:28.940 --> 14:31.740

We text every day.

Okay, I text her every day,

14:35.700 --> 14:37.100
KAMEKONA:
My man Hirsch told me

14:37.100 --> 14:39.300
you might've come
across some stolen art

14:39.300 --> 14:40.740
at a crime scene.

14:42.260 --> 14:43.060
Oh, he did, did he?

14:43.060 --> 14:44.890
KAMEKONA:
Move over.

14:44.890 --> 14:47.380
Yes, he did. So what
are we gonna do about it?

14:47.380 --> 14:49.460
"We"? Pardon me,

14:49.460 --> 14:52.180
but I was unaware
thatwewould be

14:52.180 --> 14:55.890
discussing
an ongoing investigation.

14:56.060 --> 14:57.900
Why not?
Well,

14:57.900 --> 15:00.620
for starters,
it's none of your damn business.

15:00.620 --> 15:01.940
HIRSCH:
Oh, a-actually,

15:01.940 --> 15:03.180
Kamekona is

15:03.180 --> 15:04.980
a silent partner in Crime Clean.

15:04.980 --> 15:08.740
So it is, quite literally,
his business.

15:08.740 --> 15:10.220
KAMEKONA:
That's right.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.700
Since it was Crime Clean
that brought the stolen art

15:12.700 --> 15:14.020
to Five-O's attention,

15:14.020 --> 15:16.580
I'm entitled to a sit-in.

15:18.620 --> 15:20.500
Fine.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.220
You can stay.

15:22.890 --> 15:24.180
Tani, run it, please.

15:24.180 --> 15:26.220
So, here's what we know.

15:26.220 --> 15:27.060
The victim is Sherry Wagner.

15:27.060 --> 15:28.700
She's survived
by her husband, Kurt.

15:28.700 --> 15:31.020
Kurt's family
is from Guünzburg, Germany.

15:31.020 --> 15:34.700
His grandfather emigrated to
the U.S. after World War II.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.180
So if he was part of the SS,
it's possible that he stole

15:37.180 --> 15:40.820
the paintings when the
Nazis were looting Europe.

15:40.820 --> 15:41.890
I knew it.

GROVER: Yeah, slow

15:43.890 --> 15:46.220

with the FBI Art Theft Unit.

15:46.220 --> 15:49.540
They warned us those paintings
could very possibly be fake.

15:49.540 --> 15:52.100
I was a master forger

15:53.940 --> 15:54.890
We still have to check them.

15:54.890 --> 15:57.340
Well, yeah, that might be
a problem there, sistah.

15:57.340 --> 15:59.620
If those paintings
are legit,

15:59.620 --> 16:00.540
soon as you ask to see 'em,

16:00.540 --> 16:02.890
your boy Kurt's gonna
get rid of 'em quick.

16:02.890 --> 16:05.260
Wow, that's actually,
uh, very true.

16:05.260 --> 16:06.740
We just have to pause

16:06.740 --> 16:07.220
this art thing.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.220
We got to focus
on Wagner's killer.

16:09.220 --> 16:10.620
Well, of course,
the husband did it.

16:10.620 --> 16:11.700
Yeah, it's always the spouse.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.500
Yeah, you should look into him
right away.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.100
We should look into him.
Why

Yeah.

23:56.260 --> 23:58.620

23:58.620 --> 24:00.700
I don't want to screw that up.

24:00.700 --> 24:01.890
She's smart.

24:01.890 --> 24:02.620
She's pretty.

24:02.620 --> 24:07.180
She can assemble a rifle
in under 30 seconds in the dark.

24:07.180 --> 24:10.500
Not asking her out is a screwup.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.060

33:53.180 --> 33:55.540
Do you speak English?

33:55.540 --> 33:57.130
Huh?

33:57.130 --> 33:57.700
Yes?

33:57.700 --> 33:59.130
Listen to me
very carefully.

33:59.130 --> 34:00.620
Cruise missiles
are inbound right now.

34:00.620 --> 34:02.460
They're gonna turn this place
into rubble in two minutes.

34:02.460 --> 34:06.580
Look at me. Look at me. Do you
understand what I'm saying?

34:06.580 --> 34:08.130
Do you understand?

34:08.130 --> 34:09.130
You want to live,

34:09.130 --> 34:11.130
you're gonna take us
to the tunnels

34:11.130 --> 34:13.060
underneath this building.

34:13.060 --> 34:15.020
Move.

34:23.500 --> 34:24.660
Go. Go.

34:26.740 --> 34:28.780
60 seconds. Let's go.

34:32.740 --> 34:36.220
Go, go, go!

34:38.020 --> 34:39.130
Go!

34:39.620 --> 34:42.130
Go, go, Junior, go!

35:09.060 --> 35:11.300
STEVE:
Where's the guard?

35:15.130 --> 35:17.340
He's gonna tell anybody
who's left that we're down here.

35:17.340 --> 35:18.620
There's only one way out.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.130
Yeah, which means
whoever is left

35:20.130 --> 35:22.820
is gonna be waiting out there
for us.

35:38.100 --> 35:39.100
We can't outrun 'em.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.020
We're gonna stop here
and try to hold them off

35:41.020 --> 35:43.130
till the chopper arrives.

35:43.130 --> 35:45.780
It should be here
in a few minutes.
Joe.

35:45.780 --> 35:48.180
There's 20 of them
and two of us.

35:48.180 --> 35:50.780
We're gonna be dead
in a couple minutes.

35:50.780 --> 35:52.900
We're not dying today, son.

35:52.900 --> 35:56.420
But I want you
to promise me two things.

35:56.420 --> 35:57.780
When we make it back,

35:57.780 --> 36:00.900
I want you to ask Catherine out.

36:03.660 --> 36:05.020
And I want you
to visit your dad,

36:05.020 --> 36:08.130
and I don't want to hear,
hear you say no, either.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.740
That's how you pay me back
for this.

36:11.780 --> 36:14.180
You got one father,

36:14.180 --> 36:16.300
and despite what you may think,

36:16.300 --> 36:18.130
that man loves you.

36:18.130 --> 36:22.540
Okay, Joe. Okay, Joe.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.540
JUNIOR:
Sorry for the call.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.180
Don't be.

36:27.180 --> 36:29.130
I would have done
exactly the same thing

36:29.130 --> 36:30.540
if the tables were turned.

36:30.540 --> 36:31.380
On the contrary,

36:31.380 --> 36:33.130
thank you.
For what?

36:33.130 --> 36:35.130
Showing up on my doorstep
seven months ago.

36:35.130 --> 36:36.980
JOE:
Hug it out, guys,
get it over with.

36:36.980 --> 36:38.220
We got to get out of here.

36:38.220 --> 36:39.860
STEVE:
All right, boys, this is it.

36:39.860 --> 36:43.220
It's been an honor serving
with you two.
Oh, yeah.

36:43.220 --> 36:48.020
Moments like this, I like
to say, "Try not to miss."

36:48.020 --> 36:51.130
Thank you for that
pearl of wisdom, Joe.

36:51.130 --> 36:52.460
Follow me.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.130
TANI:
So Kurt Wagner,

36:57.130 --> 37:00.180
super rich dude who wants out
of his marriage,

37:00.180 --> 37:01.980
but it's gonna cost him.

37:01.980 --> 37:03.980
So what's the solution?

37:03.980 --> 37:05.340
He kills his wife, of course,

37:05.340 --> 37:08.460
but to pull that off,
he has to have

37:08.460 --> 37:11.060
a rock solid alibi, doesn't he?

37:11.060 --> 37:11.900
And that's when you come in.

37:11.900 --> 37:14.780
GROVER:
Come to find out that you've
spent the last three days

37:14.780 --> 37:16.740
on the island of Lanai.

37:16.740 --> 37:18.940
And coincidentally,

37:18.940 --> 37:21.580
location records
for Kurt's phone

37:21.580 --> 37:23.220
also suggest

37:23.220 --> 37:25.300
that he was on Lanai as well.

37:25.300 --> 37:27.380
Problem is, nobody
that was staying

37:27.380 --> 37:30.260
at your hotel
ever remembered seeing him.

37:30.260 --> 37:31.860
Oh, you know who did
see him, though?

37:31.860 --> 37:33.500
Hmm?
Your next-door neighbor.

37:33.500 --> 37:35.260
It turns out
that Kurt was staying

37:35.260 --> 37:38.260
at your place
while you were out of town.

37:38.260 --> 37:40.130
With Kurt's phone.

37:40.130 --> 37:42.580
Whoops.

37:42.580 --> 37:45.140
It was a good plan, Olivia.

37:45.140 --> 37:47.380
And if we wouldn't have
gotten on to you,

37:47.380 --> 37:49.140
we'd have never
found out the truth.

37:49.140 --> 37:50.700
But you slipped up

37:50.700 --> 37:54.700
last night with your little
box spring bongo party.

38:05.130 --> 38:07.700
Hey.

38:10.060 --> 38:12.060
You all right?

38:13.500 --> 38:15.500
Thanks again.

38:16.740 --> 38:18.130
Come on.

38:18.130 --> 38:20.130
You probably would have died
in that place, you know.

38:20.130 --> 38:21.780
I couldn't let
that happen,

38:21.780 --> 38:24.500
not after everything
you've done for me.

38:26.300 --> 38:28.460
Listen, when we were
in Afghanistan,

38:28.460 --> 38:32.130
you said you made a
promise to keep me alive.

38:32.130 --> 38:33.180
I'm surprised
you remember that.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.130
You were pretty out of it.
I remember.

38:35.130 --> 38:38.130
And it wasn't till years later
that I realized

38:38.130 --> 38:39.540
that promise you made,

38:39.540 --> 38:41.940
that was to my mother,
wasn't it?

38:42.660 --> 38:46.130
Of course, at the time,
I thought she was dead.

38:46.130 --> 38:47.260
Even if I hadn't promised her,

38:47.260 --> 38:49.130
I would never
have left you there.

38:49.130 --> 38:51.940
I know that.

38:52.620 --> 38:56.300
You know, the day I got back,
I asked Catherine out.

38:56.300 --> 38:59.980
Hmm.
Yeah.

39:02.130 --> 39:04.980
Then I went to
see my dad, too.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.340
Because of you, I got
to spend some great time

39:07.340 --> 39:09.020
with him before
he was gone.

39:09.020 --> 39:11.940
Thank you for that.

39:14.020 --> 39:16.420
More than saving my life,

39:16.420 --> 39:18.580
thank you for that.

39:22.620 --> 39:25.980
GROVER:You didn't forget
your ID, did you?

39:25.980 --> 39:27.180
HIRSCH:
Nope.

39:27.180 --> 39:30.580
ID, boarding pass,

39:30.580 --> 39:33.020
priceless art:
check, check, check.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.900
I, uh, Googled the family.

39:34.900 --> 39:37.820
Seems like they've fallen
on some hard times,

39:37.820 --> 39:42.220
but they sell some of these,
take care of everything.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.660
Well, and if they do,

39:43.660 --> 39:45.540
you'll be the one
who's responsible

39:45.540 --> 39:47.260
for changing their lives.
Good.

39:47.260 --> 39:50.130
That's what we do--
we help people.

39:50.130 --> 39:52.420
I don't know
if I'll go that far.

39:52.420 --> 39:53.740
I help people,

39:53.740 --> 39:56.180
you mop up
their blood and guts.

39:57.380 --> 40:00.180
You can't let me
have this, can you?

40:01.060 --> 40:03.860
You know, back when
I was doing forgery

40:03.860 --> 40:07.500
and brokering deals
on the black market,

40:07.500 --> 40:10.130
it was very satisfying...

40:10.130 --> 40:12.130
financially,

40:12.130 --> 40:17.130
but it didn't do much in terms
of, uh, feeding the soul.

40:17.130 --> 40:19.860
But, uh...

40:19.860 --> 40:23.940
helping out these people...

40:23.940 --> 40:26.860
makes me feel good.

40:26.860 --> 40:29.780
Let me enjoy that.

40:30.500 --> 40:33.220
Hey, um, Hirsch.

40:34.380 --> 40:36.540
Hirsch, you did
an amazing job.

40:36.540 --> 40:37.580
Hell, if it wasn't for you,

40:37.580 --> 40:40.130
we probably would
have never gotten justice

40:40.130 --> 40:42.300
for Sherry Wagner, and...

40:42.300 --> 40:44.540
Now here you are,
getting ready to fly

40:44.540 --> 40:46.060
to the mainland on your own dime

40:46.060 --> 40:50.060
to do
this wonderful thing for...

40:50.060 --> 40:52.100
a bunch of complete strangers.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.700
I ought to be ashamed of myself.

40:57.020 --> 40:59.060
I'm proud of you, man.

41:03.540 --> 41:05.140
Hey, hey. Gee, now.

41:05.140 --> 41:08.900
I, uh, um, oh--
all right.

41:09.180 --> 41:11.130
Maybe lunch next week?

41:11.130 --> 41:13.260
Player, calm down.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.980
Hey. W-- Stop with the begging.

41:27.980 --> 41:28.780
Are you-- you're enormous.

41:28.780 --> 41:31.220
What, did you put on nine pounds
while I was away?

41:31.220 --> 41:32.500
How'd you even do that?

41:32.500 --> 41:34.780
Hey, uh, when you said you gave
Eddie a few treats,

41:34.780 --> 41:35.580
how many is "a few"?

41:35.580 --> 41:37.980
I don't know,
like three or four.

41:37.980 --> 41:39.060
What, like, every hour?

41:39.060 --> 41:40.740
Sorry. Maybe we partied
a little hard,

41:40.740 --> 41:42.420
but you get what you pay for,
you know.

41:42.420 --> 41:44.180
Which is exactly what I'm gonna
tell Adam and Kono

41:44.180 --> 41:46.100
when they come back and all
their plants are dead,

41:46.100 --> 41:47.220
because you know what?
They never even told me

41:47.220 --> 41:48.940
how much water to put in,
and I don't know.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.780
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that too much,

41:51.780 --> 41:52.540
because it didn't look like Adam

41:52.540 --> 41:54.620
was planning on coming home
any time soon.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.380
After what his sister did
to Jessie,

41:56.380 --> 41:58.130
can you really blame him?

42:03.820 --> 42:05.130
Hey, I got to let you go, okay?

42:05.130 --> 42:09.060
I got a smoke detector
that's on its last legs.

42:09.060 --> 42:10.540
Got to find batteries.

42:10.540 --> 42:12.500
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow?

42:12.500 --> 42:13.940
Okay. Bye.

42:21.900 --> 42:26.130
But, Adam, don't you think you
should stay and work the case?

42:26.130 --> 42:29.020
Don't you want to see
Noriko put behind bars?

42:29.020 --> 42:30.780
You're so close, Adam.
As far as I'm concerned,

42:30.780 --> 42:33.380
prison would be
letting her off easy.

42:33.380 --> 42:35.580
She deserves worse.

42:35.580 --> 42:38.020
A lot worse.
