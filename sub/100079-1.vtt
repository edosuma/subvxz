WEBVTT

00:00.280 --> 00:02.977
Ah, jizz, I think we might
have missed our turnoff.

00:02.980 --> 00:03.980
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, have we all haven't we?</font>

00:03.981 --> 00:05.979
This map's a total dickhead.

00:05.980 --> 00:07.979
There's tons of shit
that's just not on it.

00:07.980 --> 00:09.979
Like that tree.
Or that plough over there.

00:09.980 --> 00:11.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Do I need to turn the cart around</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">or not?</font>

00:11.980 --> 00:13.979
Er, nah, we'll be fine.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Fine? As in we'll definitely</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">end up in Tuscany?</font>

00:16.980 --> 00:19.979
Yeah, I reckon.
All this blue bit's at the side.

00:19.980 --> 00:21.659
<font color="#FFFF00">Blue bit? Do you mean the sea?!</font>

00:21.660 --> 00:23.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, yeah,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I do like to be beside the seaside.</font>

00:23.980 --> 00:25.339
<font color="#FFFF00">No, that is not what...</font>
Oh, yes!

00:25.340 --> 00:27.979
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll have a pint of prawns</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and a nap on the beach.</font>

00:27.980 --> 00:29.979
Or a shag on the beach
with a local hottie.

00:29.980 --> 00:32.979
That's what I call a holiday!
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not a holiday! How many times?!</font>

00:32.980 --> 00:35.979
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a business trip. To buy wine</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">from a vineyard in Tuscany.</font>

00:35.980 --> 00:39.979
All right, chill, got it.
Tuscany. Not a holiday.

00:39.980 --> 00:40.980
<font color="#FFFF00">So are we going the right way</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">or not?</font>

00:40.981 --> 00:42.979
Er, no, we've missed our turnoff.

00:42.980 --> 00:44.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, you howling prick!</font>
Hey!

00:44.980 --> 00:46.500
<font color="#FFFF00">Give it here!</font>
Get off!

00:49.980 --> 00:52.019
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>
PIG GRUNTS

00:52.020 --> 00:55.980
Oh,
that pig weren't on the map either.

00:57.980 --> 00:59.979
# When in Rome

00:59.980 --> 01:01.980
# Do as the Romans do

01:04.980 --> 01:06.980
# Far from home

01:07.980 --> 01:10.340
# All I got is you. #

01:12.980 --> 01:15.339
Well, the wheel's a write-off.
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, good (!)</font>

01:15.340 --> 01:17.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Because there's bound</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">to be a mechanic around here (!)</font>

01:17.980 --> 01:19.979
<font color="#00FFFF">The pig's a write-off and all,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">by the sound of things.</font>

01:19.980 --> 01:23.979
Oh, dear. Let's do the decent thing
and put it out of its misery.

01:23.980 --> 01:25.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Sure? I'm happy to eat it.</font>

01:25.980 --> 01:27.659
<font color="#FFFF00">No, there is nothing decent</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">about that.</font>

01:27.660 --> 01:29.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Let's just give it a quick,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">painless death and press on.</font>

01:29.980 --> 01:33.179
Yeah, cool. Go on, then.
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not doing it, you do it.</font>

01:33.180 --> 01:35.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Your shitty map reading's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the only reason we're on this road.</font>

01:35.980 --> 01:37.980
All right, aggy, I will.

01:38.980 --> 01:41.979
All right, come on, Mr Piggy,
let's get this over with.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.659
MARCUS GROANS

01:43.660 --> 01:44.819
PIG SQUEALS

01:44.820 --> 01:46.339
<font color="#FFFF00">I wish I'd got</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that extra collision cover now.</font>

01:46.340 --> 01:47.979
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a right old rip-off, though,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">isn't it?</font>

01:47.980 --> 01:49.979
<font color="#FFFF00">This is how these rental companies</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">get you.</font>

01:49.980 --> 01:52.979
<font color="#FFFF00">If you want to be fully insured,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you have to pay a fortune up front.</font>

01:52.980 --> 01:54.979
<font color="#FFFF00">So you decide to risk it, and then,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if you do have an accident,</font>

01:54.980 --> 01:58.979
<font color="#FFFF00">you have to pay 'em even more.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's just brutal.</font>

01:58.980 --> 01:59.980
<font color="#00FFFF">I feel your pain, boss.</font>

02:04.980 --> 02:07.979
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a bit sleepy, innit?</font>
Don't oversell it,

02:07.980 --> 02:10.979
it's deader than that pig.
In the end.

02:10.979 --> 02:13.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, sorry,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it put up a bit of a fight.</font>

02:13.980 --> 02:15.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Do you reckon they know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">how to fix carts here?</font>

02:15.980 --> 02:17.979
<font color="#FFFF00">I doubt they know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how to make fire here, Grumio.</font>

02:17.980 --> 02:19.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Or walk on two legs.</font>

02:19.980 --> 02:21.979
<font color="#11FF11">You fellas lost or summat?</font>
Hey.

02:21.980 --> 02:24.979
Yeah, we had a bit of a prang
in the road back there.

02:24.980 --> 02:28.179
<font color="#11FF11">So I see. You're a right old state.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He's fine.</font>

02:28.180 --> 02:30.659
<font color="#FFFF00">It's actually our wheel</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we're more concerned about.</font>

02:30.660 --> 02:33.979
<font color="#11FF11">Ooh, yeah.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">That's a nasty one, that is.</font>

02:33.980 --> 02:36.979
<font color="#11FF11">Dad! Come look at this here.</font>

02:36.980 --> 02:39.339
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, that's a nasty one, that is.</font>

02:39.340 --> 02:42.019
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, thank you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we're aware of how "narsty" it is.</font>

02:42.020 --> 02:44.979
<font color="#FFFF00">We're more trying to get it repaired</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">so we can get onto Tuscany</font>

02:44.980 --> 02:46.179
<font color="#FFFF00">before dark, ideally.</font>

02:46.180 --> 02:47.979
<font color="#00FFFF">All, right, well,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we'll give it a go.</font>

02:47.980 --> 02:49.819
<font color="#00FFFF">You'll need some new spokes, mind.</font>

02:49.820 --> 02:51.979
Really, you can fix this?
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I'll get my man onto it.</font>

02:51.980 --> 02:53.979
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know if he can do it</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">by nightfall, though.</font>

02:53.980 --> 02:55.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Thanks so much.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm Marcus, by the way.</font>

02:55.980 --> 02:57.979
<font color="#FFFF00">This is Jason and Grumio.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Hey.</font>

02:57.980 --> 03:00.019
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm Atlas,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this is my daughter, Calypso.</font>

03:00.020 --> 03:01.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Welcome to Soggy Ditch.</font>

03:01.980 --> 03:04.499
<font color="#11FF11">Here, if you're hanging about,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you boys should join us for dinner.</font>

03:04.500 --> 03:06.979
We should, I completely agree.

03:06.980 --> 03:08.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Right, Cally, tell Nanna</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">we've got three more need feeding.</font>

03:08.980 --> 03:10.979
<font color="#00FFFF">I believe she's down vineyard.</font>

03:10.980 --> 03:12.979
<font color="#11FF11">Right you are.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Sorry, you have a vineyard?</font>

03:12.980 --> 03:15.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, we make the best wine in</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the valley, if I do say so myself.</font>

03:15.980 --> 03:18.819
<font color="#00FFFF">Here, bide where you be,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and I shows you.</font>

03:18.820 --> 03:19.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Come on, you.</font>

03:19.980 --> 03:22.979
<font color="#11FF11">Let's get to you seen to and all.</font>

03:22.980 --> 03:24.980
Oh, yeah, do see to me.

03:27.980 --> 03:29.979
<font color="#00FFFF">You a wine lover, then,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">are you, Marcus?</font>

03:29.980 --> 03:31.979
You could say that, Atlas.

03:31.980 --> 03:35.979
Full disclosure, we actually run
the swankiest wine bar in Rome.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.979
That's why we're on our way to
Tuscany, to stock up the old cellar.

03:38.980 --> 03:40.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, well, then, you'll need</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to give me your expert opinion.</font>

03:40.980 --> 03:43.339
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know bugger all</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">about all that.</font>

03:43.340 --> 03:45.979
By all means.
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

03:45.980 --> 03:47.979
Mm...

03:47.980 --> 03:49.339
Oh, yeah.

03:49.340 --> 03:52.979
That's... got a lovely... big nose.

03:52.980 --> 03:56.979
Yeah. Long legs, a good body...
generally.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Right-oh.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I don't know how it compares</font>

03:58.980 --> 04:01.979
<font color="#00FFFF">to your lush Tuscan stuff, mind.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Apart from the difference in price.</font>

04:01.980 --> 04:02.980
THEY LAUGH

04:02.981 --> 04:05.979
Yeah, well, Tuscan stuff IS lush,
you're not wrong,

04:05.980 --> 04:06.980
but is it too lush?

04:06.981 --> 04:09.499
I honestly wonder
whether my customers

04:09.500 --> 04:11.979
wouldn't prefer something
more earthy and cheap,

04:11.980 --> 04:14.339
like, well, this.
<font color="#00FFFF">What?!</font>

04:14.340 --> 04:17.019
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, I ain't never sold my wine</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">outside the village before.</font>

04:17.019 --> 04:19.978
<font color="#00FFFF">You think them snooty, shitty folks</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">might go for it?</font>

04:19.980 --> 04:22.179
Er... if it came
with a personal recommendation

04:22.180 --> 04:23.979
from Marcus Gallo, they would.

04:23.980 --> 04:27.979
I tell you what, you do me a deal
for a few barrels now,

04:27.980 --> 04:30.979
and if it sells, I'll come back
for a few hundred later.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.979
<font color="#00FFFF">A few hundred?!</font>

04:32.980 --> 04:35.979
<font color="#00FFFF">God! I'll drink to that!</font>

04:35.980 --> 04:36.980
THEY LAUGH HEARTILY

04:38.000 --> 04:44.074

04:46.340 --> 04:49.659
You're one of them Roman buggers
joining us for dinner,

04:49.660 --> 04:51.819
then, are you?
<font color="#FFFF00">I am, yeah. Grumio.</font>

04:51.820 --> 04:55.979
<font color="#FFFF00">What is for dinner, please?</font>
Beef and truffle stew.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.980
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh...</font>

04:58.980 --> 05:02.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh... Now, then,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that is extremely scrummy.</font>

05:02.980 --> 05:04.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Beef and what, sorry?</font>
Truffle.

05:04.980 --> 05:08.979
Our local treasure.
Don't tell me you never had 'em.

05:08.980 --> 05:12.979
<font color="#FFFF00">I have not, no.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">This is not a food I recognise.</font>

05:12.980 --> 05:13.980
What are you playing at?!

05:13.981 --> 05:16.979
You're only meant to have shavings.

05:16.980 --> 05:19.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, well, shavings aren't really</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a quantity I recognise.</font>

05:19.980 --> 05:24.500
<font color="#FFFF00">Go on, give us another bite.</font>
No, get off with you. Shoo! Go on!

05:33.340 --> 05:36.979
So then I said, "How about
I take 20 barrels for 200?"

05:36.980 --> 05:38.979
Which is half of what we'd have paid
in Tuscany.

05:38.980 --> 05:41.819
<font color="#00FFFF">Magic. And what's the wine like?</font>
Yeah, seems fine.

05:41.820 --> 05:43.979
I mean, I have no idea, obviously.
<font color="#FFFF00">It's red, it's wet,</font>

05:43.980 --> 05:45.979
<font color="#FFFF00">it's getting me lashed,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what's not to like?</font>

05:45.980 --> 05:48.819
<font color="#11FF11">Beef and truffle stew!</font>

05:48.820 --> 05:52.979
<font color="#11FF11">With roast tatties</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and buttered cabbage.</font>

05:52.980 --> 05:54.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Er, if it's OK with you boys,</font>

05:54.980 --> 05:56.980
<font color="#00FFFF">we like to offer thanks</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">before we eat.</font>

05:58.980 --> 06:01.979
<font color="#00FFFF">To Mother Earth for giving us</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the fruit of our soil</font>

06:01.980 --> 06:03.019
<font color="#00FFFF">and the flesh of our flock</font>

06:03.020 --> 06:05.979
<font color="#00FFFF">that we'll enjoy together tonight.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Amen. </font><font color="#FFFF00">Amen!</font>

06:05.980 --> 06:08.179
And also to,
not Mother Earth, per se,

06:08.180 --> 06:10.979
but, well, our lucky stars
we had a prang

06:10.980 --> 06:12.979
so close to Soggy Ditch
and this wonderful family.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Love it! To new friends.</font>

06:14.980 --> 06:16.979
<font color="#00FFFF">And to no more chitchat</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">so I can eat my truffly stew.</font>

06:16.980 --> 06:18.979
ATLAS LAUGHS
<font color="#11FF11">Master?</font>

06:18.980 --> 06:20.179
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry to barge in like this.</font>

06:20.180 --> 06:22.979
<font color="#00FFFF">That's all right, Vulcan,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what is it, lad?</font>

06:22.980 --> 06:25.499
<font color="#11FF11">I just wanted to say</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I'm done mending the wheel</font>

06:25.500 --> 06:27.979
<font color="#11FF11">if your guests care to be leaving.</font>
Oh, right, fantastic.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.979
That's OK, though, thanks.
We're in no rush...

06:30.980 --> 06:32.339
now we've got our wine.
THEY LAUGH

06:32.340 --> 06:33.979
<font color="#11FF11">As you are, then.</font>

06:33.980 --> 06:36.979
<font color="#11FF11">Oh... I've not seen Caesar lately.</font>

06:36.980 --> 06:38.819
<font color="#11FF11">I'm worried</font>
<font color="#11FF11">something's happened to him.</font>

06:38.820 --> 06:40.979
Caesar? He was stabbed to death
20 years ago.

06:40.980 --> 06:41.980
Did the news not make it here?

06:41.981 --> 06:44.979
<font color="#00FFFF">No, no, no,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Caesar's the name of our pig.</font>

06:44.980 --> 06:46.979
<font color="#11FF11">He's not come in for his tea, sir.</font>

06:46.980 --> 06:48.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, it's unlike old Greedy Guts</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to skip a meal.</font>

06:48.980 --> 06:52.339
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't you worry, he'll be snuffling</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">away in his trough come morning.</font>

06:52.340 --> 06:54.979
Oh, I'm sure he will.
Maybe we should get going now,

06:54.980 --> 06:57.979
in fact, while it's still light.
<font color="#11FF11">It won't stay light for long.</font>

06:57.980 --> 07:01.979
<font color="#11FF11">Sun drops fast round here.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You boys should stay over, I say.</font>

07:01.980 --> 07:03.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Very sensible. Yeah, I agree.</font>

07:03.980 --> 07:05.979
<font color="#00FFFF">And you've too much wine in you,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">lad.</font>

07:05.980 --> 07:07.980
<font color="#00FFFF">We don't want you having</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">another prang, now, do we?</font>

07:14.980 --> 07:17.979
So this area here,
we call "the forum".

07:17.980 --> 07:19.979
<font color="#FFFF00">No way!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got one of them in Rome.</font>

07:19.980 --> 07:22.979
Go on!
I dunno what you do in your one,

07:22.980 --> 07:25.979
but here's where we have
all our big get-togethers.

07:25.980 --> 07:28.979
We once had 25 people here.
<font color="#FFFF00">Wow.</font>

07:28.980 --> 07:31.659
That's Old Tree there.

07:31.660 --> 07:34.979
Then, down by here
is our famous Soggy Ditch.

07:34.980 --> 07:38.979
<font color="#FFFF00">No way! This is it?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Cor, I'm starstruck!</font>

07:38.980 --> 07:40.979
<font color="#FFFF00">So is it always soggy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like, even now in summer?</font>

07:40.980 --> 07:41.980
You tell me.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.979
THEY BOTH GRUNT

07:45.980 --> 07:49.499
<font color="#FFFF00">Really?!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You want to do this here, now?</font>

07:49.500 --> 07:52.979
We've reached the end of our tour,
so there's bugger all else to do.

07:52.980 --> 07:54.980
<font color="#FFFF00">But, I mean, IN the actual ditch?</font>

07:56.980 --> 07:59.979
SHE MOANS LOUDLY

07:59.980 --> 08:01.980
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it is quite soggy, to be fair.</font>

08:04.980 --> 08:07.980
GRUMIO MAKES SUCKING NOISES

08:10.980 --> 08:12.979
Stop hogging the covers, Grumio.

08:12.980 --> 08:14.979
<font color="#00FFFF">I like having summat</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">between my legs.</font>

08:14.980 --> 08:16.979
And I like having something
on my body.

08:16.980 --> 08:18.979
Can you stop making
that weird sucking noise?

08:18.980 --> 08:20.979
It's like sleeping in a sink.
<font color="#00FFFF">Soz.</font>

08:20.980 --> 08:25.659
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm just searching my teeth</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for bits of truffle. I want more.</font>

08:25.660 --> 08:26.979
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna get more.</font>
No, you're not.

08:26.980 --> 08:29.179
You're going to sleep
so we can leave first thing.

08:29.180 --> 08:32.980
Just dream about truffles instead.
With less covers.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.980
HE SNIFFS

08:54.980 --> 08:55.980
<font color="#00FFFF">Bingo.</font>

08:56.980 --> 08:59.979
COCKRELL SQUAWKS

08:59.980 --> 09:01.819
So you had your roll in the hay,
then?

09:01.820 --> 09:03.179
<font color="#FFFF00">It was more like a fuck in the mud,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but, yeah.</font>

09:03.180 --> 09:05.979
Oh, lovely (!)
Pack up your things, we're off.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.659
<font color="#FFFF00">What? Why would we leave now?</font>
Why wouldn't we?

09:08.660 --> 09:10.819
I've got my wine,
Grumio got his stew,

09:10.820 --> 09:12.819
you got your hottie,
we all got what we came for.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I'd like to get mine again</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">if poss. Maybe a few times.</font>

09:14.980 --> 09:17.019
Oh, can we please, for once,
leave somewhere

09:17.020 --> 09:18.979
BEFORE everyone hates us?

09:18.980 --> 09:21.500
Before Atlas finds out
you drove a spoke into his pig.

09:22.500 --> 09:24.979
And then did something similar
to his daughter.

09:24.980 --> 09:27.979
<font color="#FFFF00">This isn't just some holiday fling,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">mate. I really like this girl.</font>

09:27.980 --> 09:30.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Me and Cally could be together</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">forever.</font>

09:30.980 --> 09:32.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Or some of forever, you know,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">like a couple of weeks maybe.</font>

09:32.980 --> 09:35.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, either way, I'm staying here</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">till it's run its course.</font>

09:35.980 --> 09:36.980
<font color="#FFFF00">You boys head back without me.</font>

09:40.980 --> 09:41.980
<font color="#FFFF00">Cally?! Ooh.</font>

09:41.981 --> 09:44.499
Oi!
<font color="#FFFF00">You all right, dude?</font>

09:44.500 --> 09:45.979
<font color="#FFFF00">You haven't seen Cally around,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">have you?</font>

09:45.980 --> 09:48.979
Cally is mine.
Do you hear me, city man?

09:48.980 --> 09:51.979
I loves her, I do.
I loves her since we was babies.

09:51.980 --> 09:53.979
<font color="#FFFF00">All right, chill,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want any agg, OK?</font>

09:53.980 --> 09:54.980
Like dirt, you don't.

09:54.981 --> 09:56.979
Why you got to be doing it
by my cottage, then, eh?

09:56.980 --> 09:58.979
Squelching around
down in Soggy Ditch

09:58.980 --> 10:01.979
and making animal noises
right under my face, it be!

10:01.980 --> 10:04.659
<font color="#FFFF00">The position was Cally's idea</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">in every sense.</font>

10:04.660 --> 10:07.819
Don't you dare blame Cally,
you wormer.

10:07.820 --> 10:10.979
We've got code round here.
Never heard of a country code?

10:10.980 --> 10:12.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, sure, like, er,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">don't start fires,</font>

10:12.980 --> 10:14.339
<font color="#FFFF00">always shut the gate...</font>

10:14.340 --> 10:18.979
Two men after the same girl
have to fight for her. To the death.

10:18.980 --> 10:20.980
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, right. Not heard of that one.</font>

10:21.980 --> 10:25.179
Well, now you know.
Forum. Sundown.

10:25.180 --> 10:29.979
And bring a bleed.
Cos I am gonna gut you, city man.

10:29.980 --> 10:31.980
I'm gonna gut you like a badger.

10:37.820 --> 10:40.979
MARCUS: And how much for the wheel?
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, no, no, that's on me.</font>

10:40.980 --> 10:44.499
<font color="#FFFF00">A token of our growing friendship.</font>
Oh, wow, that's incredibly kind.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.499
<font color="#FFFF00">You lads,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you're welcome here any time.</font>

10:46.500 --> 10:49.179
<font color="#FFFF00">Especially to buy all that wine.</font>
Then you'd better get making it.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.499
THEY LAUGH
<font color="#00FFFF">Atlas!</font>

10:50.500 --> 10:51.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Eh?</font>

10:51.980 --> 10:55.819
<font color="#00FFFF">You move my truffles somewhere?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I need 'em for market.</font>

10:55.820 --> 10:57.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Now, Nanna, why would I go</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and do a thing like that?</font>

10:57.980 --> 10:59.979
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, someone's moved 'em.</font>

10:59.980 --> 11:03.819
Right, well, we should get going.
<font color="#FFFF00">We really should, yeah.</font>

11:03.820 --> 11:05.979
I thought you wanted to let
your relationship run its course.

11:05.980 --> 11:07.979
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, it did, it sort of sprinted</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">its course in the end.</font>

11:07.980 --> 11:11.979
<font color="#00FFFF">It were you, weren't it, shorty?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">You snuffled my truffles.</font>

11:11.980 --> 11:13.979
<font color="#11FF11">Bye, then. Thanks for having us.</font>

11:13.980 --> 11:16.499
<font color="#FFFF00">Hold up, whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Hold on up. Oncoming!</font>

11:16.500 --> 11:21.340
<font color="#00FFFF">Atlas! It's Caesar!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">We found him on the road.</font>

11:22.333 --> 11:25.973
Oh, dear. That is a nasty one.

11:25.975 --> 11:31.470
For subtitling services, contatct:
waqas.zahoor89@gmail.com

11:31.471 --> 11:32.790
<font color="#FFFF00">Right...</font>

11:32.791 --> 11:37.651
<font color="#FFFF00">So by my reckoning,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you owe me another... 250 denarii.</font>

11:37.658 --> 11:40.657
<font color="#11FF11">250? You out of your mind?</font>
Grumio, please.

11:40.658 --> 11:43.657
Are you out of your mind, though?
You got all your wine back.

11:43.658 --> 11:45.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, and we only killed,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">like, one pig.</font>

11:45.658 --> 11:49.657
<font color="#FFFF00">That weren't any old pig, though.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Caesar were a prized truffle hunter.</font>

11:49.658 --> 11:53.657
<font color="#FFFF00">He'd earn us a fortune every show</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with what he'd snuffle out.</font>

11:53.658 --> 11:55.857
<font color="#FFFF00">Then there's the truffles</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">your man-child stole,</font>

11:55.858 --> 11:57.497
<font color="#FFFF00">and the cart repairs...</font>

11:57.498 --> 12:00.657
Well, I thought that was a token
of our growing friendship.

12:00.658 --> 12:02.697
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, but now that friendship's</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">shrunk down to fuck all.</font>

12:02.698 --> 12:06.657
Sure, and I get that, just...
we don't have that kind of cash.

12:06.658 --> 12:09.337
<font color="#FFFF00">You told me you own</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the swankiest bar in Rome.</font>

12:09.338 --> 12:12.857
Yeah, that was a bit of a porky.
If you'll pardon the expression.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.497
<font color="#FFFF00">What a surprise.</font>

12:14.498 --> 12:16.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, you'll just have to work</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">off the debt, then, won't you?</font>

12:16.658 --> 12:19.657
<font color="#FFFF00">On the farm.</font>
OK. That might not be so bad.

12:19.658 --> 12:22.657
<font color="#11FF11">Sure, we can pick some grapes</font>
<font color="#11FF11">or summat, one for you, one for me.</font>

12:22.658 --> 12:27.657
<font color="#FFFF00">No, no, no, no. You'll be tilling</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">the south field down by there.</font>

12:27.658 --> 12:32.017
<font color="#FFFF00">It should only take a month or so.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll fetch some tools directly.</font>

12:32.018 --> 12:33.658
<font color="#00FFFF">Morning.</font>

12:39.658 --> 12:42.017
Hey. Cally, hi.

12:42.018 --> 12:45.337
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, my lover?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Last night were lush, weren't it?</font>

12:45.338 --> 12:49.657
Yeah, it was, er... well,
quite a lot like that, I guess.

12:49.658 --> 12:51.017
THEY LAUGH

12:51.018 --> 12:53.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Get on all fours tonight,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and we'll try and fill the bucket.</font>

12:53.658 --> 12:56.017
Yeah, I might not make it through
till then,

12:56.018 --> 12:59.657
your talking scarecrow ex-boyfriend
wants to kill me at sundown.

12:59.658 --> 13:03.177
<font color="#00FFFF">Bleeding hell, does he?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I didn't mean for that to happen.</font>

13:03.178 --> 13:05.657
Didn't you, though?
Cos you did choose to get jiggy

13:05.658 --> 13:07.657
right outside his lair.

13:07.658 --> 13:09.177
<font color="#00FFFF">I just wanted to him</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to get the message</font>

13:09.178 --> 13:11.337
<font color="#00FFFF">that me and him's over,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that he should drop it.</font>

13:11.338 --> 13:12.657
Well, he didn't get the message.

13:12.658 --> 13:14.657
In fact, the whole
message-getting part of his brain

13:14.658 --> 13:16.657
seems to be made of cheese
or something.

13:16.658 --> 13:18.657
<font color="#00FFFF">This is a right pickle.</font>
No shit (!)

13:18.658 --> 13:20.657
He's gonna gut me like a badger.

13:20.658 --> 13:22.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, dear.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, lovely meeting you anyway.</font>

13:22.658 --> 13:26.657
Hang on, can't we sit down and talk
about this like grown-ups? Please?

13:26.658 --> 13:28.657
Or at least find a solution
that doesn't involve him

13:28.658 --> 13:29.658
turning me inside-out.

13:34.658 --> 13:36.657
<font color="#11FF11">I'd rather have the fork</font>
<font color="#11FF11">than the spoon, to be honest.</font>

13:36.658 --> 13:39.657
<font color="#FFFF00">It's a spade, not a spoon,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you clown.</font>

13:39.658 --> 13:42.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, don't tell me you boys</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">never done no digging before.</font>

13:42.658 --> 13:45.177
Not really, Rome's mainly paved.

13:45.178 --> 13:47.177
<font color="#FFFF00">Get to it, and I'll have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a carrot for you at noon.</font>

13:47.178 --> 13:49.177
<font color="#11FF11">Carrot? What about the stew?</font>

13:49.178 --> 13:52.658
<font color="#FFFF00">Stew... is for guests.</font>

13:54.338 --> 13:56.657
OK, come on, Grumio,
if we really knuckle down,

13:56.658 --> 13:58.857
we can get this done
in a couple of weeks or so.

13:58.858 --> 14:00.657
DULL THUD

14:00.658 --> 14:04.657
<font color="#11FF11">Why is the ground so hard?</font>
I don't know, just sort of is.

14:04.658 --> 14:05.658
<font color="#11FF11">No, sorry, not for me.</font>

14:05.659 --> 14:08.497
Oh, please, Grumio,
I'm not doing this on my own.

14:08.498 --> 14:10.657
<font color="#11FF11">Let's not do it at all, then.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Oi, Atlas!</font>

14:10.658 --> 14:12.657
<font color="#11FF11">Atlas, son,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we're not doing your digging, mate.</font>

14:12.658 --> 14:14.657
What are you playing at?
<font color="#FFFF00">You get to work, lad,</font>

14:14.658 --> 14:16.657
<font color="#FFFF00">or I'll lash you.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">No, ta.</font>

14:16.658 --> 14:18.657
<font color="#11FF11">How about I find another way</font>
<font color="#11FF11">of paying you back?</font>

14:18.658 --> 14:21.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no, I ain't gonna bed you, boy,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you ain't my type.</font>

14:21.658 --> 14:24.657
<font color="#11FF11">No, sorry, I mean,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">finding you a fuck ton of truffles.</font>

14:24.658 --> 14:27.657
<font color="#FFFF00">And how are you gonna do that?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">You murdered my pig, remember?</font>

14:27.658 --> 14:30.337
<font color="#11FF11">I'll use my truffle sense.</font>
Your what, sorry?

14:30.338 --> 14:32.657
<font color="#11FF11">That very first nibble</font>
<font color="#11FF11">gave me some freaky powers.</font>

14:32.658 --> 14:34.657
<font color="#11FF11">I could sniff out</font>
<font color="#11FF11">them smelly buggers anywhere.</font>

14:34.658 --> 14:37.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Is he soft up top or summat?</font>
Er, he is softish up top, yeah,

14:37.658 --> 14:40.657
but in fairness, he did find
Nanna's stash last night.

14:40.658 --> 14:44.658
<font color="#11FF11">Trust me, I can be the new Caesar,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you just give me a chance.</font>

14:46.658 --> 14:48.658
<font color="#FFFF00">Looks like we're going</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">truffle hunting.</font>

14:49.658 --> 14:50.858
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll round up the cousins.</font>

14:59.498 --> 15:00.657
Thank you, both,
for agreeing to be here,

15:00.658 --> 15:03.657
it's a massive first step.
Why don't we start by saying

15:03.658 --> 15:05.337
what we're hoping to get
out the session?

15:05.338 --> 15:07.658
And remember,
there's no wrong answers. Cally?

15:09.338 --> 15:12.657
<font color="#FFFF00">I suppose, I want Vulcan to get</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that I need to see other fellas.</font>

15:12.658 --> 15:14.657
Great.
And, Vulcan, what do you want?

15:14.658 --> 15:16.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I wants Cally.</font>
Right.

15:16.658 --> 15:18.497
But if she wants to see other guys,
then...

15:18.498 --> 15:20.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I'll kill 'em.</font>
No, that's not gonna work.

15:20.658 --> 15:22.657
<font color="#00FFFF">What? You said</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">there's no wrong answers.</font>

15:22.658 --> 15:24.657
Well, sometimes there are.
That is a wrong answer.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.657
Are you sure you don't want
to be with him, Cally?

15:26.658 --> 15:30.657
If you really search your heart.
<font color="#FFFF00">I have done, and I'm sure.</font>

15:30.658 --> 15:33.497
Search a little harder, then.
You know, really have a nosy round.

15:33.498 --> 15:36.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Nah, the thought</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of his big flappy hands on me</font>

15:36.658 --> 15:38.177
<font color="#FFFF00">turns my stomach.</font>
VULCAN GROANS LOUDLY

15:38.178 --> 15:40.657
I know,
what about an open relationship?

15:40.658 --> 15:42.657
<font color="#00FFFF">What's that, then?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">That sounds modern.</font>

15:42.658 --> 15:44.857
It is.
Yeah, it's all the rage in Rome.

15:44.858 --> 15:47.657
It's where a couple stay together,
but are also free

15:47.658 --> 15:50.657
to diddle other people.
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, no, that won't do.</font>

15:50.658 --> 15:52.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I wants Cally for mine and mine own,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and that's an end to it.</font>

15:52.658 --> 15:55.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I'm sorry, Vulcan,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but you can't have me!</font>

15:55.658 --> 15:58.657
<font color="#FFFF00">You'll just have to murder everyone</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I sleeps with.</font>

15:58.658 --> 16:00.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Fine, I will, then.</font>
Well, don't give up now!

16:00.658 --> 16:01.658
Look, violence isn't the answer.

16:01.659 --> 16:03.657
<font color="#00FFFF">Hang on, he ain't trying to help us</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">at all,</font>

16:03.658 --> 16:06.657
<font color="#00FFFF">he just don't want me to gut him.</font>
Well, obviously.

16:06.658 --> 16:08.177
Look, this has got nothing
to do with me,

16:08.178 --> 16:09.657
this is between you and Cally.
If anything,

16:09.658 --> 16:11.657
you should be gutting her.
<font color="#00FFFF">Don't be daft!</font>

16:11.658 --> 16:13.657
<font color="#FFFF00">This has to be settled</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by the fellas,</font>

16:13.658 --> 16:15.657
<font color="#FFFF00">it's how we do it round here.</font>

16:15.658 --> 16:17.658
<font color="#FFFF00">I will come and watch, though.</font>

16:19.658 --> 16:21.658
<font color="#00FFFF">See you at sundown, city man.</font>

16:25.658 --> 16:28.657
I'd offer some words of advice,
but I've not really been

16:28.658 --> 16:31.497
in this highly-specific situation
before.

16:31.498 --> 16:33.657
<font color="#11FF11">I just need to think like a pig,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I reckon.</font>

16:33.658 --> 16:34.658
Shouldn't be too hard for you.

16:34.659 --> 16:37.657
<font color="#11FF11">I mean, I've not had a wash</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in a while, to be fair.</font>

16:37.658 --> 16:39.657
ATLAS PLAYS A FANFARE

16:39.658 --> 16:41.658
<font color="#FFFF00">Release the pig!</font>

16:46.658 --> 16:49.658
MUSIC: 'Come Down' by Lord Tanamo

17:01.658 --> 17:04.018
<font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>
MUSIC CONTINUES

17:26.498 --> 17:29.857
Oh! He's found one.
He's only bloody found one!

17:29.858 --> 17:31.657
<font color="#11FF11">We're on a roll now, baby.</font>

17:31.658 --> 17:33.697
<font color="#FFFF00">No, that's badger shit.</font>

17:33.698 --> 17:35.658
ALL GROAN

17:43.338 --> 17:47.177
Creeping off, are you?
Like the shit pot weasel you are.

17:47.178 --> 17:50.657
<font color="#FFFF00">What? No, I wasn't creeping off,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I was creeping round.</font>

17:50.658 --> 17:53.497
<font color="#FFFF00">You know, for fitness.</font>
Pig dirt. You was fleeing.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.697
And if I can't trust you
to turn up on time,

17:55.698 --> 17:58.657
we're gonna do this right here,
right now.

17:58.658 --> 17:59.658
<font color="#FFFF00">I haven't even got a weapon!</font>

17:59.659 --> 18:01.657
There is a stick there, look.

18:01.658 --> 18:04.698
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, no way. Come on,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Vulcan, mate, don't do this.</font>

18:06.018 --> 18:08.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Look, as soon she meet another girl,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you'll be over Cally in a flash,</font>

18:08.658 --> 18:10.657
<font color="#FFFF00">I know you will.</font>
What other girl?

18:10.658 --> 18:11.697
The only other girl round here
is my sister.

18:11.698 --> 18:13.657
<font color="#FFFF00">And is that not an option?</font>

18:13.658 --> 18:15.658
Not really, no. It's frowned on.

18:16.658 --> 18:18.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Just need to get out there more,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">meet new women.</font>

18:18.658 --> 18:21.657
Stupid talk. Where would I go?
<font color="#FFFF00">Rome's full of girls.</font>

18:21.658 --> 18:24.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Girls that'd go mad</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">for your backward country charm.</font>

18:24.658 --> 18:27.177
Really? You reckon?

18:27.178 --> 18:30.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Big time. Hey, why don't you come</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">with us and find out for yourself?</font>

18:30.658 --> 18:33.657
I suppose, I mean,
if Cally won't have me,

18:33.658 --> 18:36.657
there's bugger all for me here.
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, now you're talking sense, boy.</font>

18:36.658 --> 18:38.657
All right, then. Yeah, I'm in.

18:38.658 --> 18:40.657
I suppose I'd better not cut
you open, now, then, eh?

18:40.658 --> 18:42.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Ideally not, yeah. Good shout.</font>

18:42.658 --> 18:44.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah!</font>
Come here.

18:44.658 --> 18:49.338
<font color="#FFFF00">OK! Ow! I'm so happy.</font>

18:51.658 --> 18:53.657
<font color="#11FF11">My truffle sense must've fogged up.</font>

18:53.658 --> 18:56.657
<font color="#11FF11">Probably got a sniffle from</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you nicking the covers last night.</font>

18:56.658 --> 18:57.658
HE LAUGHS
Yeah, it could be that,

18:57.659 --> 19:00.657
could be my fault,
or maybe your truffle sense

19:00.658 --> 19:03.697
never existed in the first place.
<font color="#11FF11">I found the stash, didn't I?</font>

19:03.698 --> 19:05.657
<font color="#11FF11">I sniffed out the right jar.</font>

19:05.658 --> 19:08.657
Mm-hm. So you knew
they'd be in one of the jars, then?

19:08.658 --> 19:09.658
<font color="#11FF11">Well, yeah, I mean...</font>

19:09.659 --> 19:12.657
And how many jars did you look in
before you found the right one?

19:12.658 --> 19:15.017
<font color="#11FF11">Only about... Yeah, most of them.</font>

19:15.018 --> 19:17.857
Suddenly a bit less impressive,
isn't it?

19:17.858 --> 19:20.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi! Boys!</font>
Where the bloody hell have you been?

19:20.658 --> 19:22.657
Get digging!
<font color="#FFFF00">Fuck that, bruv.</font>

19:22.658 --> 19:25.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Come on, we're bouncing.</font>
Bouncing? Bouncing, how?

19:25.658 --> 19:27.178
<font color="#FFFF00">I'll show you.</font>

19:31.658 --> 19:34.658
<font color="#11FF11">Hang on...</font>
<font color="#11FF11">we've nearly earned those carrots.</font>

19:38.498 --> 19:40.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I needs to stay with you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for a spell, mind.</font>

19:40.658 --> 19:41.658
<font color="#00FFFF">Just till I finds my feet.</font>

19:41.659 --> 19:44.177
<font color="#00FFFF">I could share a bed</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with the tiddler here.</font>

19:44.178 --> 19:45.657
<font color="#11FF11">Great. Sounds wicked.</font>

19:45.658 --> 19:47.657
We're taking
the terrifying simpleton, then?

19:47.658 --> 19:50.658
<font color="#FFFF00">We are, yeah. Trust me,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">it was the best option on the table.</font>

19:51.858 --> 19:54.657
Hurry up, Vulcan.
<font color="#00FFFF">Right you are.</font>

19:54.658 --> 19:57.657
<font color="#11FF11">Atlas,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">those boys be trying to scarper!</font>

19:57.658 --> 19:59.658
MAN: <font color="#FFFF00">You what?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Atlas!</font>

20:01.338 --> 20:03.657
<font color="#00FFFF">See you, Cally! I'm going down Rome!</font>

20:03.658 --> 20:06.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna get me one of them</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">open relationships!</font>

20:06.658 --> 20:08.657
<font color="#11FF11">Well, I'm glad you two kissed</font>
<font color="#11FF11">and made up.</font>

20:08.658 --> 20:10.657
<font color="#FFFF00">No thanks to you,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I could've been butchered today.</font>

20:10.658 --> 20:11.658
VILLAGES SHOUT

20:11.659 --> 20:13.657
<font color="#11FF11">You still might</font>
<font color="#11FF11">if you don't get a wiggle on.</font>

20:13.658 --> 20:15.657
Oh, shit! The cousins!

20:15.658 --> 20:17.658
<font color="#FFFF00">They've genuinely got pitchforks!</font>

20:18.658 --> 20:21.497
<font color="#11FF11">Make the horsey go faster!</font>
I'm trying!

20:21.498 --> 20:22.657
He's struggling
with the extra weight.

20:22.658 --> 20:24.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Come back here, you buggers!</font>

20:24.658 --> 20:26.658
<font color="#00FFFF">We needs to lighten the load!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Er...</font>

20:28.338 --> 20:30.698
Not the wine! We need that!

20:33.658 --> 20:34.698
HE GRUNTS ANGRILY

20:36.658 --> 20:38.697
<font color="#11FF11">It's not enough, we need more speed.</font>

20:38.698 --> 20:41.657
<font color="#FFFF00">Hey, Vulcan,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">how much would you say you weigh?</font>

20:41.658 --> 20:43.657
<font color="#00FFFF">I'd say about...</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">three and a half sheep?</font>

20:43.658 --> 20:44.658
<font color="#FFFF00">That'll do.</font>

20:48.658 --> 20:49.658
HE LAUGHS

20:49.659 --> 20:53.657
<font color="#00FFFF">You wormer! You badger fucker!</font>

20:53.658 --> 20:57.658
<font color="#FFFF00">Ha! Eat my dust,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you mouth-breathing bitch!</font>

JASON SCOFFS

21:13.018 --> 21:14.857
Well, that was all
a complete waste of time.

21:14.858 --> 21:17.657
<font color="#FFFF00">As if! That was one of the all-time</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">great road trips, mate.</font>

21:17.658 --> 21:20.337
Yeah, that wasn't exactly
my primary aim.

21:20.338 --> 21:23.657
And we are going home with fuck all.
<font color="#11FF11">I wouldn't say that, mate.</font>

21:23.658 --> 21:25.657
<font color="#11FF11">Someone just found a cheeky truffle</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in his pocket.</font>

21:25.658 --> 21:28.657
<font color="#11FF11">It must've fell in there last night.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Nice one.</font>

21:28.658 --> 21:32.657
<font color="#11FF11">Er... no, no, that is badger poo.</font>
