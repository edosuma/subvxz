00:10.120 --> 00:15.640
Zarah, you said you left the bank
a few minutes before the robber arrived.

00:15.720 --> 00:16.600
Is that right?

00:17.240 --> 00:19.320
Yes. I left through the back door.

00:20.560 --> 00:21.800
Why did you do that?

00:22.480 --> 00:24.960
I sometimes do when I'm going that way.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.160
So you and the robber left the same bank
and entered the same apartment?

00:30.240 --> 00:31.800
Only a few minutes apart.

00:31.880 --> 00:32.720
Yes.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.120
Why?

00:34.200 --> 00:36.200
It's a strange coincidence.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.160
Why can't you just prescribe some more?

00:41.240 --> 00:43.800
<i>Zarah, sleeping pills don't help.</i>

00:43.880 --> 00:46.440
<i>The only way to rid yourself</i>
<i>of your anxiety</i>

00:46.520 --> 00:51.040
<i>is to go to therapy</i>
<i>or stop the kind of work you do,</i>

00:51.120 --> 00:54.080
<i>if that's where</i>
<i>you get your panic attacks.</i>

00:54.160 --> 00:56.440
I'll have to see a different doctor.

00:56.520 --> 00:57.920
Thank you. Bye.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.160
<i>Change your lifestyle--</i>

01:01.200 --> 01:03.160
JÄRNGATAN 1,
VIEWING 30 DECEMBER

01:03.240 --> 01:04.280
Oh my God.

01:14.040 --> 01:15.480
GREW UP AT JÄRNGATAN 1

01:15.560 --> 01:17.160
Järngatan 1.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.920
No!

01:44.720 --> 01:45.680
Hello.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.160
Are you alone?

01:50.400 --> 01:51.640
Yes, exactly.

01:52.800 --> 01:55.720
It's a large apartment for one person.

02:33.640 --> 02:36.640
Hi, are you the real estate agent?

02:37.520 --> 02:41.760
-Do I look like one?
-You need shoe covers for viewings.

02:55.040 --> 02:56.960
-I need to get out.
-That was a quick tour.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.320
I need to get out.

03:04.360 --> 03:07.200
Did you know any of the other hostages?

03:07.280 --> 03:11.000
What? No, certainly not.
And I've already answered that question.

03:11.080 --> 03:14.320
Why were you at the viewing?

03:15.120 --> 03:17.320
Is this your new, clever question?

03:17.400 --> 03:19.000
Please, just answer the question.

03:19.080 --> 03:21.760
Yes, why do you go to a house viewing?

03:21.840 --> 03:26.040
-I don't know. I asked the question.
-You don't know? To look at houses.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.280
-As a prospective buyer.
-Do you know what?

03:28.360 --> 03:31.920
I get a feeling that
you're not telling me the whole truth.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.160
It feels like
you're protecting the robber.

03:35.880 --> 03:39.560
You've not even been able to give
a proper description of the robber.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.720
I've answered every question.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.440
He was wearing black and a balaclava.

03:45.520 --> 03:47.560
-You already said that.
-What else can I say?

03:47.640 --> 03:50.240
His build. You must have some impression.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.920
Oh, it's head office.
I really need to get this.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.280
Good. I think we're done.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.600
The voice. Was there an accent?

03:59.680 --> 04:02.200
I didn't hear him speak. I don't know.

04:02.280 --> 04:05.320
Could you just hold on a second?
Thank you.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.160
I've said all I can remember.
I need to take this.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.680
-Zarah speaking.
-Thank you very much.

04:10.760 --> 04:11.600
Thank you.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.080
Thank you for holding.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.360
-They've left now.
-Thanks.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.360
What the hell?

04:50.440 --> 04:51.840
Get down!

05:00.360 --> 05:02.240
-Hello.
-It's occupied.

05:02.320 --> 05:05.400
I can't get my head off. It's stuck.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.080
I was checking to see
if there are scissors in here.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.080
No!

05:09.160 --> 05:11.640
The zip has gotten stuck somehow.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.440
Pull…

05:14.600 --> 05:16.160
How hard can it be?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.600
You need to help me.

05:19.920 --> 05:20.960
Thanks a lot.

05:21.480 --> 05:23.480
I'll have to try another way.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.760
-How's it going?
-I'm looking.

05:29.840 --> 05:30.680
Who's Zarah?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.240
What?

05:32.320 --> 05:34.280
It says Zarah on the letter.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.240
-Turn around.
-Okay.

05:40.280 --> 05:43.800
I can't breathe.
I feel like a boiled bunny in here.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.280
Pull the damn thing off.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.400
-There.
-Thank you very much.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.000
How the hell did you do that?

05:59.240 --> 06:00.080
I just…

06:03.440 --> 06:04.440
Hand cream.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.440
It's good for most things.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.760
-Hand cream?
-Yes.

06:10.840 --> 06:13.760
-I shall remember that. Thank you so much.
-Okay.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.440
What a damn situation we've ended up in.

06:20.520 --> 06:23.840
Exactly. It's crazy.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.200
Are you a real estate agent?

06:30.280 --> 06:33.240
No, I'm not.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.480
You don't come across
as a potential buyer.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.360
Are you a plumber?

06:39.120 --> 06:41.760
You have a plumber's aura, you see.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.520
Is the plumbing being redone?

06:49.840 --> 06:53.080
I want to be alone. Would you…

06:53.160 --> 06:54.400
Hand cream.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.720
Yes, hand cream.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.440
-Thank you.
-Sure.

07:36.640 --> 07:37.720
Hello.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.680
I came in here to be alone.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.400
Didn't you hear me?

07:44.480 --> 07:48.360
I don't want to stay out there.
I'm worried Roger is gonna hit me again.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.000
-Hey.
-Yes?

07:54.080 --> 07:56.240
I'm actually an actor.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.200
Not a performance artist.

07:58.280 --> 07:59.320
That's something

08:00.520 --> 08:01.400
I do on the side.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.400
I would call you a viewing wrecker.

08:12.480 --> 08:19.000
It's not what I want to do, but times
are tough for people who work in the arts.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.760
Aren't times tough
for those trying to sell their apartments?

08:23.840 --> 08:26.320
Do you feel sorry
for those trying to sell their homes?

08:26.400 --> 08:29.680
People like you with your "side hustles,"

08:29.760 --> 08:31.160
or whatever you call it,

08:31.240 --> 08:34.320
are manipulating the economic system.

08:34.400 --> 08:37.040
The price of property is insane.

08:37.120 --> 08:41.360
I would say that
I'm trying to normalize it.

08:41.440 --> 08:44.680
The normalizing, horny musketeer?

08:50.080 --> 08:50.920
Okay.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.480
-So, listen…
-Well…

08:54.560 --> 08:57.840
Buying an apartment
is the largest investment people make.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.920
They want the best price.

09:01.440 --> 09:03.360
Doesn't the seller want the best price?

09:05.600 --> 09:07.960
-Well…
-Yeah, exactly.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.840
God.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.360
So what does Zarah do?

09:16.440 --> 09:17.720
What?

09:17.800 --> 09:19.240
What does Zarah do for a living?

09:19.320 --> 09:20.160
Please.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.040
I work for a bank.

09:23.600 --> 09:24.760
I'm a bank manager.

09:25.720 --> 09:26.680
Excuse me?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.800
What is it?

09:29.880 --> 09:33.640
You, if anyone,
are manipulating the system.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.640
-Shall I tell you how?
-Yes.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.400
The banks lend money,
and people end up in debt.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.960
They can't afford to pay rent,
mortgages, interest, or whatever.

09:42.040 --> 09:45.320
-The banks make all the profit.
-It's easy to blame the banks.

09:45.400 --> 09:49.160
-The banks are to blame.
-I'm not forcing anyone to borrow money.

09:49.240 --> 09:52.480
During the financial crisis,
the bank repossessed all the apartments

09:52.560 --> 09:55.120
because people couldn't afford
to pay the high interest.

09:55.200 --> 09:57.240
They lost everything.
Their homes, their jobs.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.960
And then everything went to pot.

10:00.640 --> 10:02.560
You're saying that's my fault?

10:04.160 --> 10:07.680
Are you saying it's my fault
that people's lives go to pot?

10:08.480 --> 10:11.000
Well, you can't blame
the mortgage holders.

10:18.480 --> 10:19.840
Yes, it's my fault.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.200
My damn fault.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.520
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:27.760 --> 10:28.600
Shit.

10:32.680 --> 10:35.240
A Julia called to book an appointment.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.200
Julia?

10:36.280 --> 10:37.600
She said she knew you.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.720
Julia and Ro. They're a couple.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.160
They want to meet and discuss a mortgage.

10:42.240 --> 10:45.840
No, I really can't do that.
Tell them I don't have time.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.040
One hundred and forty five.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.920
Yes. Hello.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.440
It's regarding a payment.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.480
We charge 50 kronor for paying out money.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.280
-Sorry?
-We charge 50 kronor for paying out money.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.240
What the hell?

11:08.320 --> 11:09.520
So I lose 50 kronor?

11:10.280 --> 11:11.880
Should I transfer to your account?

11:11.960 --> 11:14.360
What else would you do?

11:14.440 --> 11:15.840
Can I see your ID?

11:16.360 --> 11:18.000
No problem.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.160
Oh no. You were too slow taking the card.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.320
That'll cost 50 kronor.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.720
-One hundred.
-Do you want the money or not?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.400
You could at least wave back.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.520
I've paid your company 50 kronor.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.720
I should get a wave for that.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.680
-I thought you hated banks.
-I had to come in.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.040
-Did you need to borrow money?
-I always need to borrow money.

11:56.120 --> 12:00.000
I'm an impoverished arts worker,
but you won't give me any money.

12:01.240 --> 12:03.920
Oh. Please have a seat, then.

12:05.880 --> 12:07.000
I wanted to apologize.

12:07.080 --> 12:10.640
What I said about the banks
was not meant as a personal attack.

12:11.240 --> 12:12.680
It was nothing against you.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.800
What I said, on the other hand,
was directed at you personally.

12:19.880 --> 12:20.920
I really meant it.

12:21.000 --> 12:25.720
You have a lot of theories
about the market and manipulation,

12:25.800 --> 12:27.080
and it's just ridiculous.

12:27.160 --> 12:29.160
What you believe in is nonsense.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.640
And what do you believe in?

12:32.480 --> 12:33.400
Love.

12:35.400 --> 12:38.200
No one can attend
hundreds of house viewings

12:38.280 --> 12:41.720
without realizing that
there's more love in the world than hate.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.160
What are you basing that on?

12:46.400 --> 12:49.400
All the apartments that aren't for sale.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.320
Most people actually want to
carry on living together.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.080
Shall we grab a pizza?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.600
No, I fancy sushi.

13:06.520 --> 13:07.480
Sushi…

13:08.360 --> 13:09.400
Cat food.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.400
It's actually harmful.

13:12.040 --> 13:17.400
No, it's like medicine
compared to half a kilo of dough and--

13:25.400 --> 13:28.600
-I knew it.
-What?

13:30.440 --> 13:31.280
I see.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.040
Hello.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.240
There you are.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.800
So you're here together.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.480
-Yes, here we are.
-Yes.

13:46.600 --> 13:48.480
-Is that a problem?
-Yes.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.400
Lying in a police interview
is a bit of a problem.

13:52.480 --> 13:55.000
As you've obviously done, Zarah.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.920
You said you didn't know
any of the hostages.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.600
Well, this is actually a date.

14:02.720 --> 14:05.440
We've not seen each other
since the hostage situation,

14:05.520 --> 14:07.640
and I've just asked Zarah out for lunch.

14:07.720 --> 14:10.880
Is that an offense?

14:12.840 --> 14:15.320
So you're on a date. Is that right, Zarah?

14:17.840 --> 14:20.720
You've got some forceful tactics
going on right now.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.360
Well, I'm only doing my job.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.360
You can't keep blaming your job
the whole time.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.960
Right, Zarah?

14:30.760 --> 14:31.640
You can talk.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.880
What else would I blame?
I am actually only doing my job.

14:36.960 --> 14:41.200
You can choose your profession,
not just blame things on it.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.560
Or is that something that's inherited?

14:45.440 --> 14:48.160
-Inherited?
-Are you a policeman by succession?

14:48.240 --> 14:51.760
Did you inherit your job
from Daddy Policeman out there?

14:54.280 --> 14:55.120
Funny.

14:56.120 --> 14:56.960
Great.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.120
-He was here this morning as well.
-What?

15:01.200 --> 15:03.920
He came to interrogate me
and asked lots of questions.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.360
Right. So what did you say?

15:13.120 --> 15:14.760
I need some fresh air.

15:15.520 --> 15:16.800
I need to open a window.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.640
-Get down.
-Do as Roger says. Get down.

15:29.960 --> 15:32.880
I need to get out.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.640
I need to get out!

15:38.360 --> 15:41.240
Oh fuck! Get down!

15:43.440 --> 15:45.080
Don't shoot. We're on the floor.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.880
What the hell are you doing?
You almost killed my wife.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.480
I think we're okay.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.840
I'm sorry, but what do you want?

15:56.920 --> 15:58.160
We just wanna get out.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.200
<i>This is Jim Johansson.</i>
<i>Is everybody unharmed?</i>

16:01.960 --> 16:05.080
<i>I want to know that everybody is unharmed.</i>

16:05.160 --> 16:08.480
<i>Please give us a sign if that is the case.</i>

16:09.960 --> 16:10.920
Sorry.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.920
We're staying put.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.320
Unless you intend to kill me now,
I want to get out.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.640
Why are you keeping us locked up here?
Tell us what you want.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.440
No!

16:30.280 --> 16:33.400
Everybody get down! Get down!

16:33.480 --> 16:35.920
We're on the floor.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.720
We're on the floor. Everything's cool.

16:38.800 --> 16:41.200
Everybody's on the floor.

16:41.280 --> 16:43.640
Keep calm!

16:43.720 --> 16:46.760
Oh fuck.

16:46.840 --> 16:47.760
Hello?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.560
Is everything okay?

16:51.600 --> 16:53.000
What the hell is this?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.360
If you have hostages, you make demands.

16:55.440 --> 16:59.480
He's not made any demands.
He's a darn amateur hostage taker.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.720
I agree, Roger.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.000
If we get to rate
his efforts online later,

17:05.640 --> 17:10.400
I'll be pretty negative, you know.
I'll give him a straight face emoji.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.200
A big thumbs down for the whole situation.

17:13.280 --> 17:16.320
Shut the fuck up, fucking bunny!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.960
Shut up! Quiet.

17:19.040 --> 17:22.920
I'll buy you lunch,
but I want to choose what we talk about.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.360
-Sure.
-We could have a deeper conversation.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.240
I'll be asking
some awkward questions and stuff.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.720
-Fine, as long as you're paying.
-Sure.

17:35.480 --> 17:36.720
Will you lend me some money?

17:56.240 --> 18:01.080
Sometimes you have to go against
your internal compass as part of your job.

18:01.920 --> 18:03.920
You know you're talking about yourself.

18:11.680 --> 18:16.080
A man committed suicide
after I denied him a bank loan.

18:16.960 --> 18:17.800
What?

18:19.440 --> 18:21.840
He came to me during the financial crisis.

18:24.400 --> 18:28.920
Since then, I've been obsessed with
finding out everything about him.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.960
I wanted to know
where he grew up, who he was…

18:33.040 --> 18:37.680
I've got a notebook
where I've written what I've found out.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.920
Then I saw that ad in the paper about

18:43.160 --> 18:45.840
the viewing, and I saw that it was

18:46.480 --> 18:49.000
the same address
where he grew up, so I went.

18:53.160 --> 18:58.000
I saw a photo on the desk
in his childhood room.

18:58.600 --> 19:00.040
I saw a photo of him.

19:02.160 --> 19:04.600
Sorry, I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.960
I've never told anyone this before.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.640
Am I the first person
you're telling this to?

19:14.400 --> 19:15.640
A horny rabbit.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.240
How does that feel?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.880
It feels unexpectedly good.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.880
It actually does.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.240
Hey, Zarah.

19:40.920 --> 19:44.760
Regardless of what's happened before,
you need to try to carry on.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.400
You have to try to do better.
A do-over, a chance to do it right.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.520
You make it sound so easy.
It's not that easy.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.360
Who said it would be easy?

20:09.680 --> 20:14.480
Hi, will you book a meeting
tomorrow with Julia?

20:15.640 --> 20:17.400
The lady who contacted me earlier.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.800
Tell her to bring Ro as well.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.120
Did you know?

20:28.200 --> 20:29.760
No, but it's obvious.

20:32.320 --> 20:34.200
-Hello.
-Hi.

20:34.280 --> 20:36.280
-Jill.
-Hi.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.840
Oh, it's good to see you.

20:42.360 --> 20:43.200
Do you see?

20:43.280 --> 20:44.360
-Hey, bro.
-Hi, sis.

20:46.440 --> 20:50.520
-How long have you been here?
-Not that long. It's okay.

20:50.600 --> 20:53.080
You must be-- Are those your things?

20:53.160 --> 20:56.640
Come in. Let's not stay out here
in the cold.

21:00.440 --> 21:01.880
Oh. Shit.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.840
So, have you slept with Cecilia yet?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.640
No, I haven't.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.480
Why? She's pretty.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.680
We're colleagues.

21:16.760 --> 21:19.200
You could be more than that. I think--

21:19.280 --> 21:20.400
Jill.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.920
We thought you'd come for New Year's.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.640
I know. It didn't quite work out.

21:26.720 --> 21:27.640
No.

21:28.760 --> 21:30.960
Why? Did something happen?

21:31.040 --> 21:36.120
No, I owed a friend money
and had to pay it back.

21:36.200 --> 21:42.960
I would have lost my apartment otherwise,
so it was an emergency.

21:43.600 --> 21:48.040
I would have called,
but my phone ran out of charge.

21:49.040 --> 21:49.960
Yes.

21:50.040 --> 21:55.520
Do you know what I was thinking?
Why don't you move back home?

21:55.600 --> 22:00.720
What are you doing up there?
It's totally pointless you being there.

22:00.800 --> 22:02.600
But, Dad, what would I do here?

22:02.680 --> 22:03.880
Live with us.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.800
I'm not sure about that.
Are you sure you would like that?

22:06.880 --> 22:08.320
Should we share a room?

22:08.400 --> 22:12.640
-We'll chuck the stuff from the office.
-But that's our office.

22:12.720 --> 22:17.960
-Finding a job wouldn't be--
-What kind of job would she get here?

22:18.040 --> 22:19.520
What? I could get a job.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.600
Most jobs require qualifications.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.760
-It's not that easy.
-Well, thank you.

22:24.840 --> 22:27.160
Let's not ruin the atmosphere.

22:27.240 --> 22:31.360
Let's toast to finally being together.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.440
-And to Mom.
-Yes.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.440
Cheers.

22:40.040 --> 22:42.920
Jack was just telling me that
he's sleeping with Cissi at work.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.800
-It's true.
-Stop it.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.920
Forget Cissi. What's for dinner?

22:50.000 --> 22:53.200
-Toasted almond chicken.
-The usual thing.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.480
The usual, then.

23:06.560 --> 23:07.600
Hi.

23:08.280 --> 23:10.360
Are you alone? Where is Ro?

23:10.880 --> 23:15.200
She's been away all night,
and she knew we were meeting here today.

23:15.280 --> 23:17.720
I've tried to call, and she won't pick up.

23:17.800 --> 23:19.440
Yeah, well,

23:20.880 --> 23:22.040
let's go inside.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.120
You know the apartment
next to the one we saw?

23:29.200 --> 23:31.640
It's also for sale, and it's much cheaper.

23:32.320 --> 23:36.840
We don't have that much in savings,
but we'll put all of it into the deposit.

23:36.920 --> 23:40.760
No, don't do that.
You always need some emergency funds.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.120
That's really important.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.640
Okay, yes, but then it's not enough.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.920
Hang on.

23:47.960 --> 23:51.000
I thought I could offer you
an interest rate of 1.8 %.

23:51.760 --> 23:54.720
And you only start paying off the loan
after a year.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.160
I gather you won't be working
during your maternity leave?

23:59.320 --> 24:00.560
How does that sound?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.760
Are you sure?

24:04.840 --> 24:08.480
Yes, I will okay this now,
and I'll be your guarantor.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.040
Can you do that?

24:10.120 --> 24:11.960
No, I can't.

24:12.040 --> 24:16.720
But I've handed in my notice,
so sign this before I change my mind.

24:19.360 --> 24:21.960
Ro needs to sign it too.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.160
Sure.

24:24.800 --> 24:29.920
Take the documents with you,
and she can sign later.

24:34.400 --> 24:35.560
I've handed in my notice.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.400
<i>Well done, Zarah. How does it feel</i>
<i>to be an ex-bank manager?</i>

24:38.480 --> 24:40.680
Great. It feels really good.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.000
But…

24:45.800 --> 24:48.360
<i>-But what?</i>
-It's this letter.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.760
I haven't opened it yet.

24:52.280 --> 24:54.280
<i>Come on, Zarah.</i>

24:54.880 --> 24:57.120
-I can't do it.
<i>-Listen.</i>

24:57.200 --> 25:00.120
<i>Either you open that letter</i>
<i>and have closure</i>

25:00.200 --> 25:02.440
<i>or you let it go and move on.</i>

25:02.520 --> 25:06.400
<i>You can't not open it</i>
<i>and at the same time dig deeper</i>

25:06.480 --> 25:11.680
<i>into who this man was and go to a viewing</i>
<i>of the apartment he grew up in.</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:14.840
-I know, but--
<i>-Otherwise, you'll never escape this.</i>

25:17.840 --> 25:21.840
<i>And there's another thing</i>
<i>you've got to do.</i>

25:21.920 --> 25:23.240
What?

25:23.840 --> 25:26.200
<i>See me again. Soon.</i>

25:26.800 --> 25:29.240
<i>I demand you do that.</i>

25:29.320 --> 25:30.160
I'd love to.

25:31.200 --> 25:33.000
<i>You can come over now if you like.</i>

25:33.080 --> 25:34.160
I'm at work,

25:34.240 --> 25:37.720
but I'd love to come over later.

25:40.680 --> 25:41.840
-Hi.
-Good morning.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.880
Breakfast is ready.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.880
-Okay.
-Will you wake Jill?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.000
Sure.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.960
Sis, time to get up.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.600
Jill? Dad has made breakfast.

25:52.680 --> 25:54.400
I'm frying them both sides.

25:54.920 --> 25:56.040
Would you like the same?

25:57.320 --> 25:59.840
Jill might want hers boiled.

25:59.920 --> 26:00.880
Jill?

26:02.640 --> 26:03.720
She's left.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.920
She can't have.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.280
She's not here, Dad.

26:09.600 --> 26:13.760
-She must have gone for a morning walk.
-Come on.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.800
Where's your wallet?

26:16.520 --> 26:17.840
In my coat pocket.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.000
She's taken it.
It's not here. Shit, I knew it.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.280
The tablet was here yesterday.
It's also gone.

26:25.360 --> 26:27.160
We'll have to call and block the card.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.920
That's what I keep saying, Dad.
We can't trust her.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.880
Now we have to report her for theft.

26:32.960 --> 26:35.480
Do you think I'd report my own daughter?

26:35.560 --> 26:37.240
Then I will do it.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.920
I'll say I gave her the stuff.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.680
So… Yeah.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.280
That's what I'm like.

26:50.720 --> 26:51.760
It's…

27:12.840 --> 27:15.360
I'm sorry to bother you.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.160
Jack? Julia needs to talk to you.

27:20.680 --> 27:23.400
Has something happened?
Is it about the robbery?

27:25.160 --> 27:28.560
It's Ro. She's gone. She has disappeared.

27:29.160 --> 27:32.360
-She didn't come home last night either.
-Oh.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.440
Will you help me?
