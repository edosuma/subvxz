NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.769 --> 00:06.649
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.707 --> 00:08.482
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.542 --> 00:11.352
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.411 --> 00:12.685
These are their stories.

00:14.715 --> 00:18.356
We weren't flapping in the wind or anything.
We were lying on our stomachs.

00:18.418 --> 00:20.523
Looked to us like you were
lying on her stomach.

00:20.587 --> 00:21.657
That was totally innocent.

00:21.722 --> 00:24.464
Hey, look, pal, in this heat, I don't
know how you could do it in the place.

00:24.525 --> 00:27.802
But you were, and it's
gonna cost you 75 bucks.

00:28.161 --> 00:29.162
This really chews.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.230
(MACHINE GUN SHOTS)

00:30.297 --> 00:31.298
Shots!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.810
(PEOPLE SCREAMING)

00:32.866 --> 00:35.244
What's going on?
What's going on?

00:35.302 --> 00:37.407
Back there!
He's shooting everybody!

00:37.471 --> 00:39.542
This is Park Ten!
We have shots fired.

00:39.606 --> 00:41.381
Man with gun
behind the Conservatory.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.579
(SHOTS CONTINUE)
Don't stop! Keep moving!

00:42.743 --> 00:43.915
(SCREAMING CONTINUES)

00:44.878 --> 00:47.256
This is Park Ten!
We got people down!

00:47.314 --> 00:51.660
I see 15, 20! We're
behind the Conservatory.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.857
We're gonna need
EMS down here, big time!

00:54.154 --> 00:59.194
(PEOPLE CRYING)

01:02.329 --> 01:05.367
Witnesses saw a male, white,
mid to late 20s,

01:05.432 --> 01:07.173
average height and weight.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.545
T-shirt, shorts, sunglasses,
blue baseball cap.

01:11.104 --> 01:14.017
The fastest way out of the
park is the Vanderbilt Gate.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.485
You got people
covering that area?

01:15.542 --> 01:17.453
Yes, sir.
Canvassing Fifth Avenue.

01:17.844 --> 01:19.846
First shots came
from over there.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.551
Guy just moved
through the crowd.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.926
Emptied a clip, reloaded
from a black knapsack.

01:24.985 --> 01:28.432
We got 11 people down.
Wounded are at Mt. Sinai.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.328
(SIGHS)

01:34.394 --> 01:36.806
So, what do you
want to do first?

01:38.765 --> 01:41.268
Maybe the guy's A.C.
went on the fritz.

01:41.335 --> 01:42.678
You think?

01:45.505 --> 01:47.007
Oh, God!

Let's go.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.441
Come on.

02:24.177 --> 02:26.282
Let's go talk
to some witnesses.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.700
I got three kinds of patients
down here.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.077
Hysterical, unconscious
and expired.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.810
You want to talk to someone,
try X-ray. Second floor.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.214
Eddie, the elevator's
over here.

03:29.276 --> 03:30.778
Stairs are faster.
Hey, Loo.

03:30.844 --> 03:32.721
What's the count?
I heard 11 on the radio.

03:32.779 --> 03:34.156
BRISCOE: Yeah.
Plus four here.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.284
Fifteen dead?

03:35.348 --> 03:36.349
And 12 wounded.

03:36.416 --> 03:38.828
We're going upstairs to talk
to one of the survivors.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.826
ED: Ms. Drake,
I'm Detective Green.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.528
This is Detective Briscoe
and Lieutenant Van Buren.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.864
Can you talk to us
about what happened?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.497
Yes, I think so.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.563
How you feeling?

03:49.629 --> 03:51.108
Lucky.

03:51.164 --> 03:54.441
There was this girl lying to
me in the field, Claudia Shue.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.243
I was sitting with her group.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.681
What group is that?

03:58.738 --> 04:01.184
DRAKE: We're pre-med
at Hudson.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.916
I heard these pops
and Laura fell over,

04:04.978 --> 04:06.116
then Claudia.

04:06.613 --> 04:08.217
There was this guy
coming towards us.

04:08.281 --> 04:10.659
I got up to run,
but my leg just gave out.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.995
This guy,
what did he look like?

04:13.053 --> 04:15.795
He was white, I barely saw him.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.127
I kept my head down,
I played dead.

04:19.493 --> 04:23.270
He walked right past me,
shooting and muttering stuff.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.233
VAN BUREN: Muttering what?

04:27.100 --> 04:31.913
"Damn bitches." He just kept saying that.
"Damn bitches."

04:33.240 --> 04:36.187
The weapon's a nine mil
SMG fired at full auto.

04:36.243 --> 04:38.814
We're looking for a converted
Ingram or Rolf.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.483
Most of the dead
and wounded are women?

04:40.547 --> 04:43.426
All but two. And there were
plenty of men to shoot at.

04:43.483 --> 04:47.363
Seventeen of the female victims
were pre-med students at Hudson.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.990
They were the first ones
shot, right here.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.365
So the guy trolled the park
for women to shoot.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.732
Is there a sketch?
BRISCOE: Yeah.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.001
But it looks like half
the people in this room.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.542
I got a call from the Daily News. They
want to run it on the front page.

04:58.598 --> 05:00.441
Media calls
get routed to Public Affairs.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.945
It was a personal contact.

05:02.269 --> 05:05.250
I hope you didn't make any promises
you can't keep. Questions?

05:05.305 --> 05:07.080
No. But I think we ought
to release the sketch.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.346
It's too generic.

05:08.408 --> 05:09.944
Well, that could work
to our advantage.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.490
If the guy has a false sense of
security, he might make a mistake.

05:12.546 --> 05:13.718
He might make one if he thinks

05:13.780 --> 05:15.885
there's going to be a knock
on his door any minute.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.426
Any other groups of women
in the area.

05:18.618 --> 05:20.427
There was a soccer game
in the East Meadow.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.991
Yeah, and a bunch of flower-sniffers
from the Conservatory.

05:24.057 --> 05:27.004
But he chose
these pre-med students.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.631
Let's find out who knew
they were meeting in the park.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.338
It was an orientation to discuss
gender issues in med school.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.110
There was a flyer
about it in the lobby.

05:38.371 --> 05:40.112
ED: You have
a copy of it?

05:40.173 --> 05:41.516
Yeah, sure.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.216
It's okay.
Take your time.

05:53.587 --> 05:55.362
How long was this posted?

05:55.422 --> 05:56.560
A couple of weeks.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.832
This says that the orientation was
by the pool on the west side.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.634
How'd they end up
clear across the park?

06:01.728 --> 06:05.676
Oh, there were people playing Frisbee
so we had to find someplace else.

06:06.566 --> 06:08.102
Oh, you were with them?

06:08.168 --> 06:09.238
Yes.

06:09.302 --> 06:13.114
We had to walk across the park
before we found someplace quiet.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.318
We'd already wasted
half an hour,

06:16.376 --> 06:18.583
and I had to leave
for a meeting.

06:19.613 --> 06:20.785
(PHONE RINGS)

06:21.381 --> 06:24.692
I have to get that. All these
parents have been calling.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.931
If the shooter followed
the girls from the west side,

06:29.990 --> 06:31.901
there's a chance
he left that way.

06:31.958 --> 06:34.768
And a chance we were looking
on the wrong side of the park.

06:35.295 --> 06:37.366
I'll break the news
to the Lieutenant.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.074
This is Mr. Gilbert Gooba.

06:42.135 --> 06:45.514
N'Goueba. Gilbert N'Goueba,
from the Ivory Coast.

06:45.572 --> 06:46.676
ED: From Abidjan?

06:46.740 --> 06:47.946
Yes. You know Abidjan?

06:48.008 --> 06:50.079
The Paris of Africa.
My father worked there.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.145
You told the officers you saw
something yesterday?

06:52.212 --> 06:55.489
Yes. I saw a white man in short
pants run out of the park.

06:55.548 --> 06:58.290
He had blood on his short pants.
He went to the subway.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.126
BRISCOE: Did you get
a look at his face?

07:00.186 --> 07:03.633
Not very good. He had big
sunglasses and a baseball hat.

07:03.690 --> 07:06.432
Was he carrying anything,
like a bag or a knapsack?

07:06.493 --> 07:08.370
No, no. If he had a bag,
I see it.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.841
He must've ditched it
in the park.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.898
Thanks.

07:12.632 --> 07:15.738
Hey, Old Spice, what did
the Loo tell you about me?

07:15.802 --> 07:18.783
Nothing. Did she tell you
I don't like nicknames?

07:19.005 --> 07:20.382
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.219
Lennie'll do.

07:23.009 --> 07:25.250
The old man used to wear
Old Spice.

07:25.579 --> 07:28.389
POLICEMAN: Detectives,
a black knapsack, right?

07:33.553 --> 07:36.830
Rolf nine mil. There's still
three full clips in here.

07:36.890 --> 07:40.861
All right, cordon off the area and radio CSU.
Tell 'em we got a pick-up for the lab.

07:40.927 --> 07:41.928
Right.
I'll take it in.

07:41.995 --> 07:42.996
Get 'em to hump right on it.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.440
Hey, Ed, it's
after 7:00.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.340
You know Shrier's not
gonna look at it tonight.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.106
Sure, she will.

07:48.335 --> 07:49.336
(DOOR OPENS)

07:50.003 --> 07:52.882
The weapon, the bag, and the clips
were clean for fingerprints.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.645
And this is why
you paged me at 6:00 a.m.?

07:55.709 --> 07:59.122
The guy tried to burn the serial
off, but the lab recovered it.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.681
The gun manufacturer said

08:00.747 --> 08:04.251
the weapon was sold four months ago
to a wholesaler in Pennsylvania.

08:04.317 --> 08:08.026
The caller ID on your page
showed a 609 area code.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.226
Where were you, Atlantic City?

08:09.289 --> 08:11.860
Uh-huh. Went down there last
night to play some poker.

08:12.559 --> 08:14.232
Oh, yeah? How'd you do?

08:14.361 --> 08:18.503
I started up a Cadillac. I finished down a Rolex.
A stainless steel Rolex.

08:18.565 --> 08:19.600
(DOOR OPENS)

08:19.666 --> 08:23.170
Okay, I did a proctoscopy
on our little patient.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.910
You see these straight lines
along the inside of the barrel?

08:25.972 --> 08:27.849
BRISCOE: Yeah.
What are they, scratches?

08:27.907 --> 08:29.409
After shooting up the park,

08:29.476 --> 08:34.015
your suspect rammed a metal file down
the barrel to distort the rifling.

08:34.080 --> 08:37.721
Means the best I can do is a 50%
match to the slugs of the victims.

08:37.984 --> 08:39.929
This guy put some
thought into it.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.557
He used fingerprint-resistant
grips.

08:42.621 --> 08:45.660
Converted the piece
from a semi to a full auto.

08:45.725 --> 08:47.102
BRISCOE: Real handyman, huh?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.571
Well, once you buy
the conversion kit

08:48.628 --> 08:52.132
all you need is a screwdriver,
a file and a soldering gun.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.508
Twenty minutes,
you're ready to make history.

08:58.371 --> 09:02.751
Fifty Rolf Nines came in
back in March.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.083
Piece you're looking for,

09:04.144 --> 09:06.852
it went out two months ago to
a firearms dealer in Reading.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.688
A licensed dealer?
Of course.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.991
By the law, I can only sell to
a federally licensed dealer.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.191
We need the store's address.

09:16.322 --> 09:17.426
He doesn't have a store.

09:17.957 --> 09:21.336
Nowhere does it say I can only
sell to a dealer with a store.

09:21.394 --> 09:24.341
So where does he sell his guns?
Out of a Good Humor truck?

09:26.199 --> 09:29.203
This is my store. I sell through
the classifieds on the Internet.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.408
And this is my
dealer's license.

09:31.471 --> 09:33.382
And where are the guns?

09:35.775 --> 09:37.015
In there.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.023
Do you remember selling
this gun?

09:40.213 --> 09:43.126
Rolf Nine.
That's the serial number?

09:52.692 --> 09:54.694
Look, guys, technically you're
out of your jurisdiction.

09:54.761 --> 09:56.741
I don't have talk to you.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.072
Maybe you tell me what's so
important about this merchandise.

09:59.132 --> 10:02.841
This merchandise was used
to kill 15 innocent people.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.541
Oh. Wait, this is
the Central Park thing?

10:08.007 --> 10:09.008
Oh, shoot.

10:09.676 --> 10:10.848
"Oh, shoot"?

10:10.910 --> 10:13.948
By law, when I sell a gun, I'm supposed
to ship it to a licensed dealer

10:14.013 --> 10:16.994
where they buyer lives, so the buyer can
pick it up and fill out the paperwork.

10:17.083 --> 10:18.323
But you didn't do that.

10:18.384 --> 10:21.160
This guy said he was
housebound in a wheelchair.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.929
And since his shipping address matched
his address on his credit card, I...

10:23.990 --> 10:25.230
You shipped it right to him?

10:25.558 --> 10:27.560
Man, that license is coming
off the wall.

10:27.627 --> 10:32.269
Hey, relax. Read the federal statute.
It's barely a traffic ticket.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.708
So you want the guy's name,
or what?

10:39.672 --> 10:43.245
Lee Coats. New York City.
Purchased a month ago.

10:44.611 --> 10:47.217
Police! Search warrant!
Go, go, go!

10:49.582 --> 10:51.493
Somebody open a window.

10:59.292 --> 11:02.239
ED: Well, she's at least a couple
of days past the expiry date.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.264
Looks like a heart attack.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.331
LAMOTTE: Hey, Lennie.

11:05.398 --> 11:06.638
Hello. Excuse me.

11:06.699 --> 11:07.700
Who are you?

11:07.800 --> 11:11.509
I'm Mrs. Felder. I live
across the hall. Oh, my.

11:12.138 --> 11:13.481
Do you know who this is?

11:13.540 --> 11:15.577
Yes, it's Lee. Lee Coats.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.985
Short for Leanne.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.783
Yes. This is terrible.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.949
She live here with anyone?

11:20.013 --> 11:24.086
No. She just got out of
the hospital two weeks ago.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.687
What hospital?
Hudson Presbyterian.

11:26.753 --> 11:30.792
She had a pacemaker put in. She
was there for nearly a month.

11:36.095 --> 11:38.473
The gun was shipped while the
old lady was in the hospital.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.511
Shipping company made two
trips to her apartment.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.013
Nobody was home the first time,
so they left a signature card.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.174
The next day, the card was signed,
so they left the package.

11:45.238 --> 11:46.239
A neighbor?

11:46.306 --> 11:47.876
Nobody who fits
the description.

11:47.941 --> 11:51.286
Now Hudson Presbyterian is the
teaching hospital for Hudson.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.885
The victims were all
pre-med at Hudson.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.385
A hospital employee?

11:55.448 --> 11:58.486
Who had access to her credit cards.
Somebody in Admitting.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.654
Good place to start.

12:00.753 --> 12:04.394
Oh, by the way, did you happen
to read the news this morning?

12:04.457 --> 12:07.028
It's pretty much a rehash of
departmental press releases.

12:07.093 --> 12:11.769
But the funny thing, the only name they
mentioned was yours, Detective Green.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.679
Maybe 'cause it was easy
to spell.

12:16.836 --> 12:18.782
This lady had Medicare,
Blue Cross, CNA.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.010
I didn't need a credit card.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.849
First thing my doctor wants to
see is a specimen of my money.

12:23.109 --> 12:25.817
Why are there two admitting forms
in here with two different dates?

12:25.945 --> 12:28.357
Oh, I filled out this one when
the paramedics brought her in.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.018
She didn't have her
insurance cards with her,

12:30.083 --> 12:31.585
so I couldn't punch in
the information.

12:31.651 --> 12:32.686
She'd lost her purse.

12:32.752 --> 12:33.787
But you had all the information

12:33.853 --> 12:35.355
by the time you filled out
the second form?

12:35.421 --> 12:36.832
They must have found her purse.

12:36.889 --> 12:37.890
Who's "they"?

12:37.957 --> 12:38.958
Ask security.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.172
Found her purse
in the ambulance the next day.

12:43.229 --> 12:44.731
Must've fallen off
the stretcher.

12:44.797 --> 12:45.969
Just like that.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.103
Yeah. Things
got a little crazy.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.909
She flatlined
in the middle of the run.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.608
Old lady's got nine lives.

12:52.672 --> 12:55.585
Eight. You don't mind, we need to
talk to your partner at the time.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.885
Dennis Trope?
He's on disability.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.356
What kind of disability?

13:01.881 --> 13:03.918
Something with his nerves.

13:04.384 --> 13:05.920
Well, is he ever
coming back to work?

13:07.654 --> 13:10.157
I've been holding some stuff
he left in his locker.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.861
He was supposed to come
pick it up.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.841
"Don't trust anything that
bleeds for five days and lives."

13:22.902 --> 13:23.903
Hilarious.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.916
We got a couple of
lady paramedics working here.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.042
Dennis had a problem with that.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.150
I don't know his comings
and goings.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.348
Is that his?

13:32.445 --> 13:33.446
You can't look in those.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.186
Just check the warrant,
Mrs. Trope.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.921
What's all this about?

13:36.983 --> 13:39.725
It's about the shootings
in Central Park.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.891
The one all those girls
got killed?

13:42.855 --> 13:44.698
Oh, no, no. Not Dennis.

13:44.757 --> 13:45.895
Basic research.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.632
I got medical books in here.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.469
Dennis is gonna be
a great doctor.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.906
He's almost been accepted
at Hudson,

13:50.963 --> 13:52.465
but they give preference
to women.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.170
Mmm-hmm. Look, ma'am,

13:54.233 --> 13:56.406
it'll work out better for Dennis
if you tell us where he is.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.039
But I don't know where he is.

13:58.104 --> 14:02.211
What, he didn't call asking about this?
Disability check.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.944
So is he coming
or are you meeting him?

14:05.011 --> 14:07.218
You know we got trigger-happy
people on the force.

14:07.280 --> 14:10.261
If we have to go find him, he's
likely to get himself shot.

14:10.316 --> 14:11.317
Is that what you want?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.891
MRS. TROPE: That's him,
over there.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.167
He's got a gun!

14:28.501 --> 14:29.878
MRS. TROPE: Dennis, no!

14:29.936 --> 14:31.279
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.782
Stay away from me!

14:32.839 --> 14:33.840
(sun SHOT)

14:33.940 --> 14:37.114
(DENNIS SCREAMING)
MRS. TROPE: Oh, my God!

14:37.176 --> 14:38.348
DENNIS: Oh, God, I'm dying!

14:38.411 --> 14:41.119
ED: You ain't dying, man!
It's just a scratch.

14:41.180 --> 14:43.160
You get nothing until
I get a statement from you

14:43.216 --> 14:44.422
about those girls you shot!

14:44.484 --> 14:46.225
I want help! You gotta
take me to a hospital!

14:46.285 --> 14:48.663
You want to go to a hospital?
Say the magic words.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.734
Say the magic words!

14:51.791 --> 14:53.532
No, stop! It hurts!

14:53.593 --> 14:56.335
Say the magic words!
"I shot the women."

14:56.395 --> 14:58.875
No, please, stop him!
Get him away from my son!

14:58.931 --> 15:00.740
All right. All right, Ed
lay off of him.

15:00.967 --> 15:03.470
Eddie, come on, come on.
Let him go.

15:03.636 --> 15:05.809
Your son's getting
medical treatment, Mrs. Trope.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.874
I don't know when
you can talk to him.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.451
Well, I'm getting a lawyer.

15:09.542 --> 15:12.682
The other detective, the black
one, he brutalized my Dennis.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.659
You better keep your hands
off him.

15:16.682 --> 15:18.684
What did Green do
to Mr. Trope?

15:18.751 --> 15:22.665
He tried to get a statement, that's all.
Just a little energetic police work.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.895
I hope this doesn't turn
into another complaint.

15:24.957 --> 15:25.958
Another?

15:26.025 --> 15:29.905
Green has two complaints for excessive force.
Review Board gave him probation.

15:30.296 --> 15:33.766
Trope has a restraining order
against him from a Lisa Fiori

15:33.833 --> 15:36.575
issued last February, which
explains why he used the old lady

15:36.636 --> 15:37.637
to buy the piece.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.273
How'd the eyewitnesses do?
They couldn't pick Trope

15:39.338 --> 15:40.476
out of a photo array.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.781
Forensics processed
his clothing, his belongings.

15:42.842 --> 15:44.719
No powder residue,
no blood splatters.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.257
So except for a couple of
remarkable coincidences,

15:47.313 --> 15:49.384
we can't tie him to the gun
or the killing.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.451
He ask for a lawyer yet? Uh-uh.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.123
Well, we don't have much time before
his mother comes back with one.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.498
I pulled some old Children's
Services files on him.

15:57.557 --> 15:58.763
There was abuse in the family.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.862
I got his employee file
from the city,

16:00.960 --> 16:03.702
and I got his Hudson
med school application.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.172
I'm ready for him.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.536
All roads lead to you, Dennis.
From the gun, to the old lady,

16:09.602 --> 16:11.843
to the hospital,
to the ambulance, to you.

16:11.938 --> 16:13.042
I didn't kill anybody.

16:13.105 --> 16:16.143
Oh, no? You know who's
on juries nowadays?

16:16.209 --> 16:17.745
Women. Right, Eddie?

16:17.810 --> 16:21.451
Most of 'em got nothing better to do than
hang around and report for jury duty.

16:21.514 --> 16:23.653
Once they hear your take
on women's rights,

16:23.716 --> 16:26.253
they'll cut your kiwis off and
hand 'em to you on a stick.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.691
You really want those bitches
deciding if you live or die?

16:31.891 --> 16:34.269
You really wanna give 'em
that last bit of power?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.310
I mean they already got both
hands on the steering wheel.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.842
They're driving buses, directing
traffic, working construction.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.422
Who the hell invited them
to the party anyway?

16:51.477 --> 16:53.787
They should be at home
watching over their kids.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.651
Detective Green.
Yes, ma'am.

16:57.717 --> 16:58.752
I got it right here.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.432
I'm sorry I didn't get it
to you sooner.

17:11.263 --> 17:12.800
I've been in this house
a month.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.714
There isn't a day that bitch
doesn't ride my ass.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.012
Lennie, Detective Briscoe,
he was in line for the job.

17:23.075 --> 17:25.521
He had the seniority.
They made her Lieutenant.

17:30.149 --> 17:32.561
I bet it's the same
where you work.

17:33.820 --> 17:36.027
You know what?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.793
It belittles us.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.498
It disrespects us.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.596
Isn't that what you felt?

17:43.863 --> 17:45.774
But we don't sit around
and mope, do we?

17:46.199 --> 17:47.200
Take you.

17:47.733 --> 17:51.442
You tried to move up the ladder,
to get into med school.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.617
And they even denied you
that opportunity, didn't they?

17:57.143 --> 17:58.213
Yep.

17:58.477 --> 18:00.650
It's a terrible thing
they did to you.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.494
They should have been
helping you, Dennis.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.320
Taking care of you.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.955
That's what women are for.

18:08.020 --> 18:10.022
To look out for you.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.536
But they let you down.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.597
They always have, haven't they?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.078
I saw your Children's Services
file.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.511
Your old man beat on you.

18:27.506 --> 18:29.315
He beat your mother.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.251
I know what that's like.

18:36.882 --> 18:41.661
Your mother was supposed
to look out for you,

18:41.721 --> 18:43.598
to protect you.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.665
She just let it happen,
didn't she?

18:48.194 --> 18:51.300
She didn't protect her baby

18:51.897 --> 18:56.971
and now, these women get
a crack at killing you.

18:59.105 --> 19:00.106
Dennis.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.318
You are in a deep hole
right now, man.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.283
There's only one way out.

19:11.150 --> 19:17.066
You tell us what you did There's no
trial, no jury, no death penalty.

19:23.629 --> 19:26.371
Please, man, please.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.204
Don't them do this to you.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.108
Don't let them win.

19:34.206 --> 19:36.277
You tried hard to be a good man

19:38.778 --> 19:41.349
and did they give you
the respect you deserve?

19:43.416 --> 19:44.918
(CRYING)

19:44.984 --> 19:47.294
Those bitch doctors
at the hospital...

19:48.254 --> 19:50.666
What about them, Dennis?
What did they do?

19:54.894 --> 19:57.932
They said that I should
apply to nursing school.

19:59.699 --> 20:04.273
See? They humiliated you.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.687
But in the park, you set
everything right, didn't you?

20:10.276 --> 20:11.414
Yeah.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.751
You put them back
in their place.

20:12.812 --> 20:13.882
Yes.

20:15.014 --> 20:16.857
And that's why you
shot them, right?

20:18.985 --> 20:19.986
Yes.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.463
We need to hear
you say it, Dennis.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.274
That's why I shot them.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.366
It's all right, it's all right.

20:33.466 --> 20:35.946
You're gonna be
all right, Dennis.

20:36.769 --> 20:40.774
We just need your help with one
more thing to make this work.

20:41.774 --> 20:44.345
The clothes you wore.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.413
You got some blood on them.
You threw 'em away.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.992
Where'd you put them?

20:50.483 --> 20:55.933
In a bag on the train
tracks on 36th.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.090
(DOOR OPENS)

20:57.156 --> 21:01.764
Mr. Trope, this is Mr. Powell, a lawyer
hired by your mother to represent you.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.267
I want to talk
to my client alone.

21:04.330 --> 21:08.437
Take your time. We need to amend the charges
to include fifteen counts of murder.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.673
You did good, Dennis.
You win.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.415
They told his mother he was
getting medical treatment.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.893
Instead, they interrogated him even though
they'd been told a lawyer was being hired.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.724
Hired when? That day?
The next day?

21:28.254 --> 21:30.928
The right to counsel doesn't attach
until an attorney is actually...

21:30.990 --> 21:32.298
Mr. McCoy, this is a mess.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.838
Mr. Trope's statement doesn't
have much probative value anyway.

21:35.895 --> 21:36.896
I'm going to suppress it.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.602
Your Honor, this wasn't
some bodega robbery.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.642
Mr. Trope sprayed Central Park
with automatic gunfire.

21:44.170 --> 21:46.047
He was out to kill
every woman he encountered.

21:46.405 --> 21:50.478
He faces the death penalty. If anything, the
police should be held to a higher standard.

21:50.576 --> 21:53.318
The statement led the police to some clothing.
I want that out too, judge.

21:53.379 --> 21:56.223
That clothing had blood splatters
from five of the victims on it.

21:56.282 --> 21:59.957
Fruit of the poisonous tree.
I'm sorry. Motion granted.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.096
Do we know where Trope got the
conversion kit for his weapon?

22:03.322 --> 22:06.326
Not yet. But even if we did, it
won't solve our big problem.

22:06.792 --> 22:07.862
We have small problems?

22:07.927 --> 22:10.840
Well, since the rifling was
scratched up, ballistics can only

22:10.896 --> 22:13.638
give us a 50% match-up from
the weapon to the slugs.

22:13.699 --> 22:16.839
That's reasonable doubt. Don't we have
rocket scientists on the payroll?

22:16.902 --> 22:20.213
Well, they say they can recreate
the rifling on a computer

22:20.272 --> 22:23.515
but they need technical data from
the gun-maker, Rolf Firearms.

22:23.609 --> 22:24.644
Okay.

22:24.710 --> 22:28.214
Well, the company's ignored
all of our requests so far.

22:29.415 --> 22:31.019
We weren't ignoring
your request.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.756
As a matter of fact, we had a
meeting with our lawyers about it.

22:33.152 --> 22:34.324
CARMICHAEL: And
what did you all decide?

22:34.787 --> 22:38.098
Much as we'd like to cooperate, it
would force us to reveal trade secrets

22:38.190 --> 22:40.295
that would damage our ability
to remain competitive.

22:40.493 --> 22:41.494
Trade secrets?

22:42.828 --> 22:44.933
Mr. Weber, you make
guns, not soda pop.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.069
You're asking us for the specs
to our manufacturing equipment.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.204
I don't understand.
If it was my product

22:50.302 --> 22:51.747
that was used
to kill 15 people,

22:51.837 --> 22:53.874
I'd sure as hell feel
it was my civic duty

22:54.140 --> 22:55.642
to help convict the person
who pulled the trigger.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.811
Being good corporate
citizens also means

22:57.943 --> 22:59.820
we have a responsibility
to our employees

22:59.879 --> 23:01.051
to keep this company
in business.

23:01.280 --> 23:02.281
Okay.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.860
We'll go the hard way then.

23:04.817 --> 23:06.626
You can expect a subpoena on
your desk by tomorrow morning.

23:06.785 --> 23:09.959
My lawyers tell me subpoenas
from New York don't travel well.

23:10.589 --> 23:12.626
I'm sorry you came all the way
up to Connecticut for nothing.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.836
It's not trade secrets,
it's lawsuits.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.766
We're asking them to help prove
their gun killed 15 people.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.040
So they'd rather spend a
half a million dollars

23:21.100 --> 23:22.101
fighting a subpoena?

23:22.168 --> 23:24.671
It's like the bastards
are asking for it.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.842
BRISCOE: Fifteen dead
pre-med students.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.212
What's that worth these days?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.317
Gotta be Bill Gates ballpark.

23:30.376 --> 23:31.753
I mean, a family in California

23:31.810 --> 23:33.949
got 5 billion dollars
for an exploding gas tank.

23:34.013 --> 23:36.789
I'd be happy if Mr. Trope got
a five dollar injection.

23:38.484 --> 23:41.556
He made atoll call to New burgh

23:42.521 --> 23:43.727
in June,

23:44.890 --> 23:46.631
about a week after
he bought the gun.

23:46.692 --> 23:47.693
What's in New burgh?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.239
Besides deer ticks?

23:49.295 --> 23:50.296
Hello?

23:52.464 --> 23:55.809
Automated information line
for the New burgh Arena.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.436
Wait a minute.

23:57.569 --> 23:59.571
I just saw an ad
in one of these.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.778
Yeah.

24:01.840 --> 24:05.185
"Show-gun Gun Show, June
10th, New burgh Arena."

24:05.511 --> 24:08.219
"Chinese AKs,
German machine pistols."

24:08.514 --> 24:10.892
"Thousands of guns,
barrels of fun."

24:13.686 --> 24:15.290
Sol had a booth at New burgh.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.730
I take a booth at a
show every weekend.

24:18.357 --> 24:20.496
Since I'm not getting rich
on my stock options...

24:20.593 --> 24:22.402
No, you're doing it
the all-American way.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.872
Selling conversion
kits for assault weapons.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.199
I don't sell kits.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.437
I sell instruction sheets,

24:27.566 --> 24:29.239
which is legal
under the First Amendment.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.575
And on the other end
of the table,

24:30.703 --> 24:31.977
you sell recoil springs

24:32.137 --> 24:34.048
and a guide plate
for a 30-round clip.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.514
You say guide plate,

24:35.608 --> 24:37.144
I say a piece of junk metal.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.945
At 50 dollars a pop?

24:39.812 --> 24:42.019
Mr. Lydell,
we just want to know

24:42.348 --> 24:45.329
if you sold a kit for a
Rolf Nine that weekend.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.233
I had one customer,

24:56.662 --> 24:58.039
bought one set of instructions,

24:58.497 --> 24:59.498
one set of hardware.

24:59.965 --> 25:02.411
Good. Now, you're gonna look
at one set of pictures.

25:03.302 --> 25:04.474
Big demand for your kits?

25:04.536 --> 25:06.277
Mostly as it relates
to the Rolf Nine.

25:06.405 --> 25:07.713
It's the easiest to convert.

25:07.773 --> 25:08.979
CARMICHAEL:
Thanks to you.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.679
You want to put me
out of business?

25:10.743 --> 25:12.416
Make the gun
tamper-proof?

25:12.745 --> 25:14.691
Just redesign the slide bolt.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.053
It'll cost you all of
10 dollars per unit.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.320
This is him.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.333
It doesn't address
our core problem.

25:23.389 --> 25:25.062
We still have to prove
we have the right gun.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.762
You call the
manufacturer again?

25:26.859 --> 25:28.805
They filed a motion to quash
the subpoena this morning.

25:28.861 --> 25:29.862
Do you feel lucky?

25:29.928 --> 25:31.271
I won't offer Trope a deal.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.673
Well, as a matter of law,

25:32.765 --> 25:34.870
can you prove that you
have the murder weapon?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.973
'Cause the jury
might want to acquit,

25:38.304 --> 25:40.409
rather than send an
innocent man to death row.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.145
That subpoena hasn't
been quashed yet.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.086
Yes, that's why
now might be the time

25:45.177 --> 25:46.986
to make your best deal
with Trope.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.924
You're taking the death
penalty off the table

25:52.017 --> 25:53.257
with the city
screaming for blood?

25:53.886 --> 25:56.526
The victims' families
need closure, not blood.

25:57.556 --> 25:58.967
My client's
a healthy young man.

25:59.358 --> 26:00.359
Life without parole,

26:00.459 --> 26:01.460
that could be
fifty, sixty years.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.133
He could always
take up smoking.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.665
Going once.
Going twice.

26:07.032 --> 26:09.137
I was reading the Law
Journal on the bus.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.509
I noticed this motion hearing

26:10.602 --> 26:12.445
in the criminal court
calendar listing?

26:12.504 --> 26:15.075
Rolf Firearms v. New York.
Judge Flint presiding.

26:15.474 --> 26:16.680
I called Flint's clerk.

26:17.242 --> 26:19.017
Seems you have
an evidentiary problem.

26:19.111 --> 26:21.182
My problem is I've got
too much evidence.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.086
The only evidence that
matters is the gun,

26:23.315 --> 26:25.022
which you can't prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

26:25.084 --> 26:26.085
is the murder weapon.

26:26.151 --> 26:27.630
You're willing to bet your
client's life on that?

26:27.686 --> 26:29.996
You must have quite a
pair of crystal balls.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.063
We'd go
25-years-to-life,

26:32.124 --> 26:33.432
all sentences to be concurrent.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.065
It's a lot of closure.

26:38.363 --> 26:40.639
Mr. Trope, in accordance
with your plea agreement

26:40.699 --> 26:42.201
with the District Attorney,

26:42.267 --> 26:44.713
I sentence you to a term
of not less than 25 years

26:44.770 --> 26:46.306
and not more than
your natural life,

26:46.805 --> 26:49.615
to be served at a facility to be determined
by the Department of Corrections.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.449
Wait.

26:51.510 --> 26:53.353
This son-of-a-bitch
could be out in 25 years?

26:53.412 --> 26:55.289
Your Honor, this isn't right.
He killed my girl!

26:55.381 --> 26:57.190
Order! Officers,
clear the gallery.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.229
McCoy, you... Why are
you just sitting there?

26:59.318 --> 27:00.388
(GAVEL POUNDS)

27:00.452 --> 27:02.454
It isn't right!
My girl's dead!

27:02.955 --> 27:03.956
He killed my girl!

27:04.890 --> 27:05.891
It isn't right!

27:06.091 --> 27:07.092
(ALL CHATTERING)

27:07.226 --> 27:08.671
Those families deserve better.

27:09.428 --> 27:11.499
They deserve to get
their daughters back.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.167
JACK: They're entitled
to an eye for an eye.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.242
We couldn't deliver, because
Rolf Firearms got in the way.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.839
The least we can do now
is give them the sense

27:18.937 --> 27:20.644
that their kids
didn't die for no purpose.

27:20.839 --> 27:22.250
What are you talking about?

27:22.541 --> 27:23.986
Rolf makes a product

27:24.076 --> 27:25.783
that any clever
12-year-old

27:25.878 --> 27:27.880
can turn into a weapon
of mass destruction.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.823
I'm appalled.
Write them a letter.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.124
If they don't know it
already, Adam, they should.

27:32.885 --> 27:35.092
Last year, 284 violent crimes

27:35.320 --> 27:37.027
were committed in the state
using a Rolf Nine.

27:37.556 --> 27:39.934
All but six of them had been
modified for automatic fire.

27:40.259 --> 27:41.363
CARMICHAEL:
And that's their fault?

27:42.761 --> 27:44.502
What are those,
grand jury slips?

27:44.630 --> 27:45.631
Yes.

27:46.665 --> 27:47.871
What are you
charging them with?

27:52.037 --> 27:54.984
Fifteen counts of criminally
negligent homicide?

27:55.541 --> 27:56.542
It's unprecedented.

27:56.909 --> 27:58.547
Mr. Weber makes
a legal product.

27:58.610 --> 28:02.387
Mr. McCoy, if the admitted killer
tampered with their product,

28:02.948 --> 28:04.689
then why blame Mr. Weber
and his company?

28:04.750 --> 28:08.357
Because the evidence their product
posed an unjustifiable risk

28:08.420 --> 28:10.491
was right in front of them,
and they failed to look.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.264
New York has strict gun laws
which aren't being enforced.

28:13.325 --> 28:15.305
Her client's business practices

28:15.661 --> 28:17.732
help criminals
circumvent our laws.

28:18.163 --> 28:20.074
The weapons used to
commit crimes in New York

28:20.432 --> 28:22.309
were traced back
to wholesalers in states

28:22.367 --> 28:24.677
with far more lenient gun laws.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.380
Records show that Rolf

28:26.538 --> 28:29.849
shipped weapons to those states far
in excess of the local demand.

28:29.908 --> 28:31.910
My client was filling
legitimate orders.

28:32.010 --> 28:33.489
They never ask
who's buying their guns

28:33.545 --> 28:35.422
or what they're
doing with them.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.788
One look at the statistics,

28:36.982 --> 28:38.222
those guns are
finding their way

28:38.283 --> 28:39.523
back to New York
in the hands of criminals.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.725
Your Honor, Rolf Firearms
is a Connecticut company.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.930
They don't sell,
manufacture, transport,

28:46.158 --> 28:48.536
or advertise their
product in New York State.

28:48.627 --> 28:51.665
There is no jurisdictional
nexus for these charges.

28:51.730 --> 28:53.300
The victims were killed here.

28:53.832 --> 28:57.370
They're dead, because the
design of Mr. Weber's gun

28:57.603 --> 28:59.776
made it attractive
to Mr. Trope.

29:00.505 --> 29:03.042
And his marketing practices as good
as put it in Mr. Trope's hands.

29:03.809 --> 29:04.810
Mr. McCoy,

29:04.910 --> 29:07.151
you're trying to use my court
to make social policy.

29:07.212 --> 29:08.691
I won't stand for it.

29:08.947 --> 29:11.188
And my interpretation of the
statute doesn't permit it.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.688
You don't have the authority
to bring these charges.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.260
Motion to dismiss is granted.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.423
Judge Wright.

29:18.523 --> 29:19.524
Thirty years,

29:19.625 --> 29:21.935
I've seen him eat the same pork
chop for lunch at Forlini's.

29:21.994 --> 29:23.337
I'm filing an appeal.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.396
Man of La Mancha?

29:24.730 --> 29:26.175
You read the
op-eds, Adam.

29:26.498 --> 29:28.375
The public wants us
to do something.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.879
JACK: The fact that
Rolf Firearms' products

29:34.039 --> 29:35.814
are used
in the State of New York,

29:35.874 --> 29:37.353
the jury gives us jurisdiction

29:37.609 --> 29:39.486
over the corporation
and its officers.

29:40.746 --> 29:43.124
That all the criminal
acts except the murders

29:43.515 --> 29:45.461
took place outside
the state is immaterial.

29:45.651 --> 29:47.028
Thank you,
Mr. McCoy.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.504
Mr. McCoy wants
to punish my client

29:54.560 --> 29:57.063
for exercising his rights
under the Second Amendment.

29:57.863 --> 30:00.605
As long as the Supreme Court
upholds the right to bear arms,

30:00.966 --> 30:02.877
the manufacture
of those arms...

30:02.934 --> 30:05.574
The Supreme Court does
recognize the state's right

30:05.637 --> 30:06.672
to regulate firearms.

30:06.805 --> 30:09.012
Well, that's the point.
Mr. Weber makes firearms

30:09.074 --> 30:11.850
that can legally be
sold in New York State.

30:12.477 --> 30:14.252
He engages
in business practices

30:14.346 --> 30:16.257
that are legal
under New York law.

30:16.848 --> 30:19.192
Mr. McCoy's problem
is with the law.

30:19.618 --> 30:22.121
Let him seek redress in the
legislature, not the courts.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.693
Thank you, counselor.
Your point is well taken.

30:25.657 --> 30:28.137
Mr. McCoy,
in the remaining time.

30:30.128 --> 30:32.734
Criminal negligence
is not a legal activity.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.872
While adhering only
to the letter of the law,

30:35.934 --> 30:39.108
Mr. Weber ignores the fact
that his product

30:39.171 --> 30:40.479
is the preferred choice

30:40.539 --> 30:43.179
of bank robbers, gang
members and mass murderers.

30:43.342 --> 30:46.619
It does sound like you want
to make social policy.

30:46.778 --> 30:48.815
The courts have always been
agents of social change.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.652
The legislative process,

30:51.483 --> 30:53.224
especially as it relates
to this issue,

30:53.418 --> 30:54.419
has been corrupted

30:54.753 --> 30:57.063
by well-funded
special interest groups.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.068
Sol urge you to let a jury,

30:59.224 --> 31:01.226
to let 12 ordinary citizens,

31:01.760 --> 31:05.367
impartial and answerable
only to their consciences,

31:05.864 --> 31:07.002
decide on the evidence

31:07.499 --> 31:09.706
where the criminal
liability rests.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.176
In their infinite wisdom,

31:15.240 --> 31:17.447
the Appellate Court
has overturned my ruling,

31:17.542 --> 31:18.782
and remanded
this case for trial.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.218
I've given a lot of
thought to this matter.

31:22.748 --> 31:24.989
Particularly the People's
burden of proof.

31:25.450 --> 31:27.088
Now here's what the ground
rules are going to be.

31:28.153 --> 31:30.394
Mr. McCoy,
the People must prove

31:30.489 --> 31:33.698
that the firearm as manufactured
was hazardous per se.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.605
Your Honor...
Now, be quiet.

31:36.161 --> 31:38.232
Unless you can show that
Mr. Trope used the weapon

31:38.296 --> 31:41.038
as it was intended
to be used by Rolf Firearms,

31:41.400 --> 31:42.902
I will entertain
a motion to dismiss

31:42.968 --> 31:44.413
at the conclusion
of the People's case.

31:44.770 --> 31:46.374
That's an impossible
standard, Your Honor.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.880
Trial date to be
set in two weeks.

31:53.812 --> 31:57.919
Mechanical engineers, industry
analysts, marketing specialists.

31:58.450 --> 31:59.690
Riveting witness list.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.822
Once the victims'
families take the stand.

32:02.187 --> 32:03.564
Yes, you have them,

32:04.056 --> 32:05.592
and the other side
has Judge Wright.

32:05.657 --> 32:09.298
He has set the bar higher than
you can jump with a pogo stick.

32:09.361 --> 32:12.069
Jack wants the jury to make a
finding of emotion, not of fact.

32:13.031 --> 32:15.841
This isn't atrial, this is
gun control by other means.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.878
When they can sell guns on the talking
Internet, talking about control is a joke.

32:19.070 --> 32:20.242
So this is your answer?

32:20.439 --> 32:22.043
Putting gun-makers
in jail?

32:22.307 --> 32:25.481
I'd like to start by putting
Rolf Firearms out of business.

32:25.610 --> 32:27.920
CARMICHAEL: Responsible adults
can own firearms

32:27.979 --> 32:30.016
without the entire country
sinking into criminal anarchy.

32:30.148 --> 32:31.149
What's the point?

32:31.216 --> 32:32.854
Maybe when the Redcoats were
coming over Bunker Hill.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.659
How about somebody six-foot-five
coming through my door?

32:36.121 --> 32:38.226
The people have a right
to defend themselves.

32:38.390 --> 32:39.528
And cops shouldn't
have to worry

32:39.591 --> 32:42.333
about running into Rambo every
time they pull over a car.

32:42.427 --> 32:44.464
Before you settle
this spat with a duel,

32:44.563 --> 32:46.509
find a way to win
your case or drop it.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.604
Rolf never put
restrictions on us.

32:50.469 --> 32:51.812
We can sell it to any retailer.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.008
It doesn't matter
whether he has a store,

32:54.072 --> 32:55.608
or a booth at a gun show.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.115
As long as he has
a federal license.

32:58.610 --> 33:02.114
Did they ever question why their guns
were in such high demand in your area?

33:02.180 --> 33:03.181
Well,

33:03.248 --> 33:06.559
I got a call last year from
somebody at Rolf asking me about

33:07.185 --> 33:10.098
sales volume in retail outlets.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.157
What was he, a sales rep?

33:12.357 --> 33:13.597
He was in marketing.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.000
A director of marketing.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.334
Guy by the name
of Victor Colby.

33:17.763 --> 33:19.834
He said he was doing
a survey for Rolf.

33:21.199 --> 33:22.803
He's not on their
employment rolls.

33:24.636 --> 33:26.547
Unless Rolf Firearms
gives me permission,

33:26.671 --> 33:28.708
there isn't much I can tell
you about my work there.

33:28.774 --> 33:30.515
Just name, rank
and serial number.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.053
You signed a non-disclosure
agreement when you left?

33:33.278 --> 33:34.586
Yes. We all did.

33:34.980 --> 33:36.618
They laid off a third
of the sales department.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.216
They laid you off?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.287
After 16 years?

33:40.552 --> 33:42.691
And you won't talk to us
about a marketing survey?

33:43.488 --> 33:44.523
I can't.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.001
Did they offer you a financial
incentive to keep your mouth shut?

33:48.627 --> 33:49.765
You're going to have to leave.

33:52.831 --> 33:54.811
I'm sure you know what
killed these people.

34:03.808 --> 34:05.151
Any help you can give us.

34:17.956 --> 34:19.697
It's an internal memo
about the survey.

34:20.225 --> 34:23.364
The company concluded that making
the Rolf Nine tamper-proof

34:23.460 --> 34:25.737
would reduce sales
by almost 40%.

34:27.032 --> 34:30.377
It was cheaper to settle any
lawsuits than to change the design.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.239
With this, we can meet Judge
Wright's standard of proof.

34:35.239 --> 34:38.083
They know their gun's easy to modify.
It's their whole marketing strategy.

34:38.810 --> 34:41.120
Trope used the gun the way
they intended it to be used.

34:41.679 --> 34:44.126
First thing tomorrow,
we re-file the indictment.

34:45.449 --> 34:47.054
Murder two,
depraved indifference.

34:48.119 --> 34:49.120
Fifteen counts.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.862
Mr. Colby signed a legally binding
agreement with Rolf Firearms.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.233
If he chooses to testify,

34:55.327 --> 34:57.238
her clients can seek their
remedies in civil court.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.966
You can't keep him off the stand, Ms. Swann.
Motion denied.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.433
Now, what about this memo?

35:01.500 --> 35:02.911
It's a privileged
communication.

35:03.068 --> 35:04.911
Written by the vice
president of marketing,

35:04.970 --> 35:06.950
and addressed to Mr. Weber?
Where's the privilege?

35:07.005 --> 35:09.212
It was CC'd to the company's
in-house counsel.

35:09.407 --> 35:11.387
It's a communication
between a client,

35:11.543 --> 35:14.149
the corporation and its
officers, and an attorney.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.955
Memo's privileged.
Motion granted.

35:21.186 --> 35:23.132
We fund safety
education programs,

35:23.221 --> 35:25.292
we participate
in an industry-wide effort

35:25.390 --> 35:27.301
to develop smart
gun technology.

35:27.359 --> 35:28.360
And yet, tragically,

35:28.660 --> 35:31.903
innocent people still get killed
by criminals using your gun.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.169
Yes. We deeply
regret that.

35:34.266 --> 35:36.644
We know the very nature of
what we do imposes on us

35:36.768 --> 35:38.145
a grave responsibility.

35:38.336 --> 35:39.337
The idea

35:39.571 --> 35:42.245
that we passively encourage
criminal conduct

35:42.307 --> 35:44.344
just to make a profit
is repugnant.

35:44.643 --> 35:45.917
It never happened.

35:51.516 --> 35:54.156
You knew your guns were being
sold unlawfully to criminals.

35:54.352 --> 35:56.059
We have no control over that.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.666
If a liquor store sells
beer to an adult

35:58.723 --> 36:01.602
who turns around and sells it to a
minor, is the brewer responsible?

36:01.826 --> 36:04.204
He is, if he makes
bubble-gum flavored beer.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.036
This is the slide
bolt for a Rolf Nine.

36:11.570 --> 36:14.016
The part that's being
modified for automatic fire.

36:16.374 --> 36:18.513
This is where the design
flaw is, isn't it?

36:18.977 --> 36:21.082
The design is not flawed.

36:21.179 --> 36:24.592
The gun is simply vulnerable to
tampering, like all firearms.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.360
If it's vulnerable,
why didn't you correct it?

36:27.552 --> 36:28.553
Suppose we did.

36:28.753 --> 36:32.724
We shut down production, we redesign
the gun, we retool the factory.

36:32.824 --> 36:33.825
Six months from now,

36:33.892 --> 36:36.839
some other bright kid finds another
way to tamper with the gun.

36:37.462 --> 36:40.443
Do we change the design again, just
to keep pace with the criminal mind?

36:40.498 --> 36:41.909
But the real problem

36:42.634 --> 36:44.375
is sales, isn't it?

36:44.502 --> 36:47.881
No, the real problem is no
one's enforcing the laws.

36:48.173 --> 36:49.277
The laws.

36:50.942 --> 36:52.819
Mr. Weber,
didn't you contribute

36:53.178 --> 36:55.784
to a special interest group
that lobbied Congress

36:56.014 --> 36:58.790
to pass the so-called
Gun Owners' Rights Bill

36:59.184 --> 37:01.528
that weakened gun control laws?

37:01.753 --> 37:03.733
We have a right to participate
in the political process.

37:04.122 --> 37:05.795
You not only
armed Dennis Trope,

37:06.157 --> 37:09.229
you undermined the very laws that
were supposed to protect us from him,

37:09.394 --> 37:10.395
didn't you?
No.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.496
No, that's not true.

37:11.596 --> 37:13.940
Look, none of this
is our fault.

37:19.738 --> 37:20.739
No more questions.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.185
Your Honor, the defense rests.

37:23.942 --> 37:25.751
Mr. McCoy,
rebuttal witnesses?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.383
Yes, Your Honor. The
People call Dennis Trope.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.721
Those high school kids out
west had semi-automatics,

37:35.120 --> 37:36.463
but there were two of them.

37:37.222 --> 37:38.223
To...

37:39.290 --> 37:41.566
...do what I wanted
to do alone,

37:42.494 --> 37:45.236
I was going to need to convert
a semi-auto to a full-auto,

37:45.363 --> 37:47.775
and the easiest one, I found
out, was the Rolf Nine.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.381
Is this the one you bought
through the Internet?

37:52.904 --> 37:53.905
DENNIS: Yes.

37:54.472 --> 37:56.952
The literature said it had
a tendency to jam, but,

37:58.743 --> 38:00.279
it worked like a pro for me.

38:00.612 --> 38:02.592
After you got this
weapon, what did you do?

38:03.515 --> 38:06.792
I bought a conversion kit at
a gun show for 50 dollars.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.829
Show us how
you converted this weapon.

38:20.698 --> 38:22.644
The bolt comes with a
little hump right here.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.310
That keeps the gun from
firing on automatic.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.038
I filed it down.

38:27.605 --> 38:28.811
How long did that take?

38:29.507 --> 38:30.508
Ten minutes.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.988
Then I changed
the recoil spring.

38:33.378 --> 38:34.516
That took five minutes.

38:34.946 --> 38:35.947
And then,

38:36.848 --> 38:39.351
I soldered the new guide plate
on the magazine feed right here.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.125
How much time, all told?

38:44.055 --> 38:45.056
Half an hour.

38:45.290 --> 38:46.291
No more questions.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.603
Let me make sure I understand.

38:48.860 --> 38:51.636
You wanted to kill as
many women as possible

38:51.730 --> 38:53.141
in the shortest amount of time?

38:53.398 --> 38:54.399
Yes.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.104
And the Rolf Nine,
as you bought it,

38:56.201 --> 38:57.976
wasn't adequate to the task?

38:59.337 --> 39:00.338
No.

39:01.373 --> 39:02.374
No more questions.

39:04.442 --> 39:08.356
Gun-makers are among the most heavily
regulated groups in this country,

39:08.480 --> 39:11.188
with an army of people
watching over them.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.559
But despite all that,

39:14.119 --> 39:15.996
this fell through the cracks.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.333
Fifteen people were killed.

39:20.391 --> 39:22.234
Now, Mr. McCoy wants
you to believe

39:22.427 --> 39:26.637
there's a straight line between their
shattered bodies and my client's factory.

39:27.832 --> 39:28.833
There isn't.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.339
There's just Dennis Trope.

39:32.570 --> 39:34.550
He was the one
who broke the law

39:34.606 --> 39:38.213
when he bought the gun, modified
it, and fired it into that crowd.

39:38.276 --> 39:39.755
Horrifyingly simple.

39:40.445 --> 39:41.480
So,

39:42.480 --> 39:44.118
why doesn't
Mr. McCoy get it?

39:45.383 --> 39:48.421
Responsible gun ownership
is an American tradition,

39:48.686 --> 39:50.165
protected by the constitution.

39:50.655 --> 39:53.192
But many people would
like to get rid of guns.

39:55.426 --> 39:57.929
Well, we all know Cain didn't
need a gun to kill his brother.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.334
As long as there are Dennis
Tropes in this world,

40:03.068 --> 40:05.810
they will find away to
kill innocent people,

40:05.870 --> 40:09.113
whether it's with a gun or a few
hundred pounds of fertilizer.

40:11.042 --> 40:13.044
But you can't blame
the fertilizer company

40:13.478 --> 40:15.389
any more than
the gun-maker for that.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.950
You put the blame
where it belongs.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.187
That's another
American tradition.

40:26.658 --> 40:29.002
Gun ownership is not
an American tradition.

40:29.294 --> 40:30.295
That's a myth.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.101
Like George Washington's
cherry tree.

40:33.231 --> 40:36.041
Most Americans, going
back to colonial times,

40:36.167 --> 40:37.373
did not own a gun.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.240
Didn't even know
how to shoot one.

40:40.071 --> 40:41.311
That's still true today.

40:43.541 --> 40:45.384
You heard expert testimony

40:46.411 --> 40:49.654
that redesigning the
slide bolt of a Rolf Nine

40:49.848 --> 40:52.761
would add 27 dollars
and 64 cents

40:53.284 --> 40:54.695
to the manufacturing cost

40:54.853 --> 40:57.333
of a weapon that sells
for 900 dollars.

40:59.157 --> 41:00.431
Mr. Weber knew

41:00.858 --> 41:01.859
that his gun

41:02.260 --> 41:04.763
was being bought
for the purpose

41:04.829 --> 41:06.968
of being converted
to an automatic weapon.

41:07.198 --> 41:09.405
His refusal to
change the design

41:09.701 --> 41:11.271
is tantamount to admitting

41:11.636 --> 41:14.480
that its intended use was
as an automatic weapon.

41:22.780 --> 41:26.057
Reasonable people can disagree
about the Second Amendment.

41:29.053 --> 41:30.327
But this can't be.

41:30.788 --> 41:33.632
What the framers of the
constitution had in mind.

41:37.662 --> 41:40.939
Of course, you must hold
Dennis Trope responsible.

41:41.466 --> 41:42.638
He pulled the trigger.

41:43.101 --> 41:44.136
But remember,

41:45.136 --> 41:48.777
because of Mr. Weber's refusal
to change the design of his gun,

41:49.541 --> 41:52.579
instead of firing
this many bullets,

41:55.613 --> 41:58.059
in the 30 seconds
that he pulled the trigger,

42:00.852 --> 42:03.526
Dennis Trope was able
to fire this many.

42:28.413 --> 42:30.450
(SOBBING)

42:35.687 --> 42:36.893
Madam Foreperson,

42:37.021 --> 42:39.228
as to each of the fifteen
counts of the indictment,

42:39.324 --> 42:40.462
murder in the second degree,

42:40.525 --> 42:42.562
has the jury reached
a unanimous verdict?

42:42.760 --> 42:43.932
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

42:44.462 --> 42:46.066
We find the defendant guilty.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.205
(ALL CHATTERING)

42:48.266 --> 42:49.643
JUDGE: Order! Order!

42:49.701 --> 42:50.702
(GAVEL POUNDS)

42:50.868 --> 42:52.245
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

42:52.303 --> 42:54.214
I thank you for your service.
You are excused.

42:54.672 --> 42:56.083
Don't pack it up
just yet, Linda.

42:57.141 --> 42:59.348
I'm finding,
as a matter of law,

43:00.645 --> 43:02.352
the People failed to meet
the standard of proof

43:02.413 --> 43:03.824
I set at the
beginning of trial.

43:04.649 --> 43:07.926
The People did not establish that
the weapon was hazardous per se,

43:08.252 --> 43:11.256
nor that the main actor in the
homicides used the weapon

43:11.322 --> 43:14.303
as it was intended to
be used by Mr. Weber.

43:14.892 --> 43:16.872
Therefore, I am setting
aside the jury verdict,

43:16.928 --> 43:19.135
and issuing a directed
verdict of not guilty.

43:19.230 --> 43:20.231
The defendant is free to go.

43:20.598 --> 43:22.271
Objection!
Order! Order!

43:22.333 --> 43:25.007
I'm filing notice of the
People's intent to appeal!

43:25.503 --> 43:27.380
This is outside the
scope of your authority!

43:27.472 --> 43:29.247
Mr. McCoy, I'm not going
to sanction a verdict

43:29.307 --> 43:31.184
that can't possible be
sustained on appeal.

43:31.676 --> 43:33.622
This conviction isn't based on

43:33.911 --> 43:35.219
any proven facts.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.526
It's based on the
jury's outrage

43:37.648 --> 43:39.958
at Mr. Weber's
irresponsible and

43:40.351 --> 43:41.762
inexcusable conduct.

43:42.854 --> 43:45.266
You want to end the
violence, the bloodletting.

43:45.323 --> 43:46.597
So do I,
Mr. McCoy.

43:47.191 --> 43:48.261
In my 30 years on the bench,

43:48.326 --> 43:50.636
I've seen every
permutation of it,

43:50.795 --> 43:52.069
and it sickens me

43:52.397 --> 43:54.377
when somebody profits from it.

43:55.800 --> 43:57.370
But tempted though I may be,

43:57.435 --> 44:00.075
putting Mr. Weber in jail
won't end the carnage.

44:01.572 --> 44:04.246
Until we cure what
ails the human heart,

44:04.709 --> 44:06.746
we won't make a dent
in the body count.

44:07.378 --> 44:08.379
In the meantime,

44:08.479 --> 44:10.618
no matter how
profound our grief,

44:11.149 --> 44:12.753
our indignation,

44:13.317 --> 44:14.318
I can't let you

44:14.585 --> 44:15.586
use this court

44:15.753 --> 44:16.754
to raise a lynch mob.

44:16.888 --> 44:17.992
I won't allow you

44:18.656 --> 44:22.126
to exploit the same base
passions Mr. Weber counts on

44:22.193 --> 44:23.729
to beef up his bottom line.

44:23.861 --> 44:26.740
It's not about
being right, Mr. McCoy.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.241
It's about doing right.

44:30.234 --> 44:31.474
Now, we're adjourned.

44:31.536 --> 44:32.537
(GAVEL POUNDS)
