00:36.509 --> 00:41.909
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:46.619 --> 00:47.950
Today, I want my look to be...

00:48.289 --> 00:49.450
How should I put it?

00:49.619 --> 00:50.890
Natural, but put together?

00:50.890 --> 00:54.789
You know. The effortless yet polished look.

00:54.859 --> 00:56.259
- You know what I mean, right? - Yes.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.000
Yes, it's me.

01:32.159 --> 01:33.469
I want to make seaweed soup with oysters,

01:33.469 --> 01:35.170
so please prepare seaweed for me.

01:35.530 --> 01:38.469
Please put the oysters in the fridge with some ice cubes.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.409
And that radish kimchi with squid.

01:40.409 --> 01:41.870
Please put it in the kimchi refrigerator.

01:41.939 --> 01:43.040
It can't ferment too much.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.140
When Do Hyeon gets home, cook the marinated wagyu for him.

01:45.609 --> 01:46.980
I'll be home around 9pm.

02:08.598 --> 02:10.568
All right. As you can see,

02:10.568 --> 02:13.139
which one looks more luxurious to you?

02:13.370 --> 02:16.310
Consumers don't care whether it has fluorescent whitening agents.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.879
Facial tissues are different though.

02:18.979 --> 02:21.349
Using green tea and aloe Vera in product development is great.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.050
They want facial tissues to be high-quality.

02:23.050 --> 02:24.120
Sure, let's say I agree.

02:24.919 --> 02:26.020
But as for toilet paper,

02:26.020 --> 02:28.520
do we really have to increase the unit price...

02:28.520 --> 02:30.819
just to make it free of fluorescent whitening agents?

02:31.389 --> 02:33.759
Consumers are very smart these days, Mr. Ahn.

02:34.129 --> 02:35.830
It was in the news recently too.

02:35.830 --> 02:38.000
They say that fluorescent whitening agents...

02:38.000 --> 02:39.430
contain carcinogens.

02:40.099 --> 02:43.500
Well, when it comes to toilet paper,

02:43.539 --> 02:45.139
it's mostly for number two.

02:45.539 --> 02:48.969
In other words, people mainly use it to wipe their butts after pooping.

02:49.210 --> 02:52.180
It's not like we leave it on the skin for an hour or two.

02:52.180 --> 02:55.180
The absorption rate of the skin around the anus or the genital...

02:55.180 --> 02:57.449
area is 42 times higher than the skin on the inner arm.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.389
That means such carcinogens can be absorbed within just a few seconds.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.490
Plus, kids with atopic dermatitis will be severely affected by it.

03:05.490 --> 03:06.759
Then, we should just put a warning label...

03:06.759 --> 03:08.289
saying such kids shouldn't use it.

03:09.759 --> 03:11.699
Price is the determining factor...

03:11.699 --> 03:13.500
when women are shopping for toilet paper.

03:13.530 --> 03:16.030
No one checks whether it has fluorescent whitening agents.

03:16.030 --> 03:19.539
All we need to do is win the price war.

03:19.539 --> 03:22.009
I wholeheartedly disagree with that.

03:23.110 --> 03:26.409
Will you be okay if your daughter continues to use that toilet paper?

03:26.810 --> 03:29.949
I wouldn't need to worry about it because my family uses a bidet.

03:29.979 --> 03:31.750
The same goes for toilet paper for bidets.

03:31.819 --> 03:34.090
Gosh.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.490
People are not likely to spend 17 dollars for a roll of toilet paper,

03:40.490 --> 03:42.259
so quality isn't important.

03:42.629 --> 03:45.800
Our job is to provide consumers with cheap toilet paper.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.530
That's what I think.

03:49.169 --> 03:50.240
Right.

03:50.639 --> 03:53.340
What do you think about changing the design on our tissue box?

03:54.069 --> 03:57.240
- Sorry? - We can use an artwork.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.780
It will look luxurious. A painting by Matisse or Kandinsky for example.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.550
Well. As far as I know, it's not legal to just take...

04:04.750 --> 04:06.620
such an image and use it.

04:07.889 --> 04:10.689
Then, we can use an image of an artwork by an artist I know.

04:11.159 --> 04:12.289
It's pop art.

05:06.110 --> 05:08.779
We have a new member who is joining us starting today.

05:08.779 --> 05:11.120
Meet Lawyer Kang Gi Ho. Let's welcome him with applause.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.889
It's nice to meet you all. I'm Kang Gi Ho.

05:15.889 --> 05:18.220
From issues related to divorce, inheritance, and fraud...

05:18.220 --> 05:20.459
to even noise issues with neighbors,

05:20.459 --> 05:23.189
I can take care of any types of litigation.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.199
- I'm Lawyer Kang Gi Ho. - Hello.

05:27.600 --> 05:28.970
- I'm Lawyer Kang Gi Ho. - Hello.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.199
Hello, Ms. Baek. I'm Lawyer Kang Gi Ho.

05:33.410 --> 05:34.410
I'm Kang Gi Ho.

05:35.009 --> 05:36.040
Today,

05:37.279 --> 05:39.180
you'll partner up with the person sitting next to you and tell...

05:39.180 --> 05:43.379
your partner 10 reasons why he or she should exist in this world.

05:43.379 --> 05:46.790
After that, you'll share it with us in your own terms.

06:03.269 --> 06:04.699
You can start first.

06:07.370 --> 06:09.339
Well... By the way,

06:09.910 --> 06:13.279
do you always wear so much makeup?

06:14.310 --> 06:16.050
Even your hair. You're all done up.

06:16.410 --> 06:18.920
You're even wearing fake eyelashes in a meditation class.

06:20.819 --> 06:24.160
I have an interview with a newspaper editor right after this.

06:24.220 --> 06:25.490
What's the interview for?

06:25.490 --> 06:27.329
Do I have to tell you?

06:27.759 --> 06:28.930
Not really.

06:29.959 --> 06:33.060
Even when I'm wearing only a little of makeup, it really shows.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.430
When I stop by a place, people think they've seen me 10 times.

06:35.930 --> 06:39.199
How should I put this? I have a strong presence.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.939
- Are you married? - Yes.

06:44.939 --> 06:46.610
You must not like seeing her with makeup.

06:46.610 --> 06:49.250
- That's right. - Are you wondering how I knew it?

06:49.949 --> 06:52.379
- Yes. - I could tell earlier.

06:52.379 --> 06:55.519
The way you talk has no depth, and you're easy to read.

06:58.360 --> 07:00.589
If you see her going out wearing a lot of makeup,

07:00.589 --> 07:02.629
don't say anything negative and just compliment her.

07:03.430 --> 07:07.000
Tell her, "You're pretty."

07:07.500 --> 07:09.269
"Why are you wearing so much makeup?"

07:09.269 --> 07:10.870
Don't say things like that.

07:11.939 --> 07:13.000
Okay.

07:14.410 --> 07:17.310
Let's get started now. Tell me the reasons I should exist.

07:22.550 --> 07:23.850
You're pretty.

07:24.680 --> 07:25.879
You're pretty.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.019
You're pretty.

07:36.629 --> 07:39.360
When we say that we know someone well,

07:39.529 --> 07:42.399
how much do we really know...

07:42.800 --> 07:44.899
about that person?

08:02.290 --> 08:06.120
Knowing someone can be a blessing,

08:06.759 --> 08:08.430
but it can also be a curse at times.

08:11.930 --> 08:13.300
I'll pay you back.

08:13.529 --> 08:17.199
I'll definitely pay you back before the end of the month,

08:17.199 --> 08:18.399
so please give me some more time.

08:19.269 --> 08:20.339
Yes.

08:20.370 --> 08:23.040
Relationships that start without any foretelling signs...

08:23.040 --> 08:24.379
or motives are always right.

08:24.910 --> 08:25.910
However...

08:26.579 --> 08:27.910
I said I'll pay you back.

08:32.350 --> 08:35.250
Every person and object eventually encounters a moment...

08:35.289 --> 08:38.289
when their true colors are revealed.

08:38.659 --> 08:39.759
Goodness.

08:39.759 --> 08:41.490
I shouldn't wipe my butt with this.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.870
I told you that I'll pay you back. I'll pay you back in full.

08:47.700 --> 08:50.940
Listen. I'm going to pay you all the overdue interest as well...

08:53.769 --> 08:56.309
When your cover is blown,

08:56.639 --> 08:59.009
you must act promptly to conceal your true colors again.

08:59.009 --> 09:00.110
I'll call you back.

09:01.309 --> 09:05.279
Otherwise, it'll hinder you from arriving at your goal.

09:08.919 --> 09:10.960
I love this class so much.

09:10.960 --> 09:13.259
Do you know how happy it makes me?

09:13.490 --> 09:15.059
Did you like your partner?

09:15.259 --> 09:16.799
Jin Kyeong said that...

09:16.929 --> 09:19.000
even someone's wrong deed...

09:19.000 --> 09:21.169
helps us define our values,

09:21.169 --> 09:23.100
so that person should exist too.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.899
In that regard, I liked him.

09:27.110 --> 09:28.940
He's been through a lot.

09:29.210 --> 09:31.909
When he was 25, he lost his wife in a car accident...

09:33.210 --> 09:36.110
on their way to their honeymoon. His parents passed away too.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.980
That's why he got a military exemption.

10:52.820 --> 10:55.360
- Father, she is... - Sir.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.629
You have a kinesiotherapy session today, right?

10:59.330 --> 11:00.629
Ms. Park.

11:00.629 --> 11:03.330
Please call Mr. Kim.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.970
He probably doesn't know about it.

11:05.799 --> 11:07.009
I'll go with Mr. Chairman.

11:11.039 --> 11:13.580
I'm originally from Chungcheong Province,

11:13.580 --> 11:15.710
but I've been living in Seoul for a long time,

11:15.710 --> 11:18.080
so I can switch between the two dialects freely.

11:19.549 --> 11:21.789
Do you prefer me talking like this?

11:25.460 --> 11:27.990
This is much better, isn't it?

11:27.990 --> 11:29.460
Right, I think so too.

11:29.559 --> 11:32.059
I'm much more comfortable this way too.

11:41.909 --> 11:45.210
Weren't you going to tell me something earlier?

11:48.549 --> 11:50.049
(J Top Plastic Surgery)

11:57.419 --> 11:58.620
Is Seong Su in surgery now?

11:58.990 --> 12:00.159
Yes.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.190
This is for you guys.

12:03.059 --> 12:05.200
Give this to him when he is out of the surgery.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.269
He was craving rice punch out of the blue this morning.

12:11.370 --> 12:12.769
- I should get going. - Bye.

12:15.970 --> 12:18.240
They say you're always the last to find out...

12:18.240 --> 12:19.440
when your husband cheats on you.

12:20.179 --> 12:22.149
She is exactly in that situation now.

12:22.779 --> 12:24.549
We should just eat this, right?

12:26.320 --> 12:28.820
Book Hye Yeong Jeong at 2pm next week for bimaxillary osteotomy.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.360
And watch what you say, okay?

12:30.990 --> 12:33.259
I should text Dr. Jang.

12:34.460 --> 12:35.490
(Dong Jae's Mom)

12:35.590 --> 12:37.759
(Hui Seop and Yun Ji enrolled in Eureka Math Institute.)

12:50.440 --> 12:51.539
My goodness.

12:55.009 --> 12:56.009
You have something here.

13:03.090 --> 13:05.320
Hui Seop and Yun Ji enrolled in Eureka Math Institute.

13:05.320 --> 13:08.389
Your wife just came by. She brought rice punch for you...

13:08.389 --> 13:09.730
to drink after surgery.

13:24.340 --> 13:26.980
- We need to meet up urgently. - Thanks for the rice punch, dear.

13:29.679 --> 13:32.220
Ji Hu, look. This is a three-dimensional object,

13:32.220 --> 13:33.820
but your drawing is two-dimensional.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.120
How can you convey the depth in your drawing?

13:37.019 --> 13:39.460
You can do it by capturing the light and shadows.

13:40.289 --> 13:41.389
Look.

13:42.259 --> 13:43.700
What do you think? Isn't it different?

13:43.700 --> 13:44.860
Yes.

13:44.860 --> 13:47.730
Who is going to pick you up today? Whom should I call?

13:47.730 --> 13:49.899
- Aunt Jin Hee. - Okay.

13:55.940 --> 13:58.879
I explained everything to Ms. Baek and asked her to reconsider it.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.210
I told her about him being reprimanded for school violence...

14:01.210 --> 14:02.750
and currently being treated for ADHD.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.519
- I said my son's scared of him too. - What did she say after that?

14:06.220 --> 14:08.519
She said it doesn't matter as they aren't in the same class.

14:09.350 --> 14:11.289
Hui Seop is one thing,

14:11.320 --> 14:13.360
but isn't Yun Ji the one with the lowest grades?

14:13.360 --> 14:16.659
How can we send our kids to the same math institute as them?

14:20.970 --> 14:22.500
Say something, A Jin.

14:23.740 --> 14:25.470
She's not trying to put them in the same class.

14:25.470 --> 14:26.870
Aren't we being too sensitive?

14:27.169 --> 14:29.110
It's not like they have a contagious disease.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.610
Who cares?

14:30.710 --> 14:33.110
A Jin, that's not what we're talking about now.

14:33.779 --> 14:35.879
Did you all get good grades in school?

14:36.610 --> 14:39.480
Is Hui Seop the only kid who is showing ADHD symptoms?

14:40.320 --> 14:43.419
Why are we trying to send our kids to the specialized middle school?

14:43.659 --> 14:45.990
Let's be honest. Haven't you heard about arranged marriages...

14:45.990 --> 14:47.929
among graduates of such schools?

14:48.059 --> 14:49.460
Why do you think their parents make them...

14:49.460 --> 14:51.200
only hang out with high school alumni...

14:51.230 --> 14:52.799
even after entering prestigious universities?

14:53.230 --> 14:54.570
Why do they do that?

14:56.000 --> 14:58.500
A Jin, Ji Hu should quit too.

14:58.570 --> 15:00.909
- I'll try to find a good tutor. - I don't want to do that.

15:01.009 --> 15:03.110
Ji Hu's grades have gone up,

15:03.269 --> 15:05.610
and A Jin is closer to Ms. Baek than any of us are.

15:05.710 --> 15:07.049
It won't be easy for her.

15:09.110 --> 15:12.379
Both Do Hyeon and Su Min go there. I'll move them elsewhere.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.820
There is a spot in the advanced class at LCL,

15:14.850 --> 15:15.990
so I'll move Do Hyeon there.

15:15.990 --> 15:18.490
And I want Su Min to get tutored with your kids.

15:18.690 --> 15:20.190
That's what I've decided to do.

15:20.759 --> 15:23.029
- I'll stay. - I'm quitting.

15:23.659 --> 15:24.730
Me too.

15:27.730 --> 15:29.700
Then, Ji Hu will be the only one left in the class.

15:29.799 --> 15:32.769
No. Ms. Baek's son, In Jae and Ji Hu will be the only ones left.

15:36.779 --> 15:39.009
Okay. The tutoring sessions should be at my place, right?

15:39.440 --> 15:41.610
Why don't we take turns each month?

15:41.610 --> 15:43.580
The three of us should talk about it another time.

16:12.210 --> 16:15.450
Ju Mi. You should've turned the light on. It's too dark.

16:15.879 --> 16:16.980
Have you been drinking?

16:16.980 --> 16:18.649
Wine doesn't even count as alcohol.

16:19.519 --> 16:20.590
Do you want a glass too?

16:21.389 --> 16:22.419
Ju Mi.

16:22.419 --> 16:24.919
Let's not drink at home. Why don't we go out?

16:24.919 --> 16:26.019
Forget it.

16:27.360 --> 16:29.529
There are no tent bars in Gangnam.

16:32.399 --> 16:34.899
I really want to go to a tent bar today.

16:35.799 --> 16:38.570
Chicken gizzards and fish roe soup.

16:39.639 --> 16:42.240
I also want to eat the cheap udon that comes in a plastic container.

16:45.379 --> 16:47.710
We can go. Let's go to Hongdae.

16:47.710 --> 16:49.309
Let's drink all night.

16:49.679 --> 16:50.820
Shall we?

16:51.679 --> 16:52.720
Really?

16:53.820 --> 16:55.720
All right, let's do it.

16:57.789 --> 17:00.590
By the way, I know that Ms. Jo is off today,

17:00.590 --> 17:02.590
but where are Ms. Park and Father?

17:03.830 --> 17:05.098
They are out on a date.

17:16.210 --> 17:17.509
What is Ji Hu doing?

17:17.509 --> 17:20.680
She is doing her English homework. She doesn't even waste a minute.

17:20.680 --> 17:23.250
I'm like that too. I never waste any of my time.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.019
I mean, why do you think I came here instead of Jin Hee?

17:29.150 --> 17:31.420
To me, this moment is very...

17:32.890 --> 17:34.730
This is such a meaningful moment for me.

17:35.730 --> 17:36.829
Thank you.

17:38.930 --> 17:39.960
Give me a cup of tea.

17:40.470 --> 17:42.529
I won't want to leave if I eat tteokbokki again.

17:43.599 --> 17:45.200
I made potato pancakes.

17:52.680 --> 17:56.180
Everything in Insa-dong closes at night like this,

17:56.180 --> 17:58.019
so there is nowhere to go for food.

17:59.019 --> 18:00.289
Back in the day,

18:00.319 --> 18:02.690
poetry recitation competitions used to be held here.

18:04.059 --> 18:05.720
Poetry is great.

18:06.519 --> 18:07.529
Sir.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.460
Do you like poetry?

18:09.960 --> 18:12.230
Yes, I do.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.740
"Meadow, meadow, golden meadow."

18:19.369 --> 18:21.569
"The burning fire in the deep mountain valley..."

18:21.769 --> 18:24.609
"is the golden meadow by the grave of my beloved."

18:24.980 --> 18:27.710
"Spring is here. Spring light has come..."

18:30.279 --> 18:33.119
"to the tip of the willow and onto its thin branches."

18:33.390 --> 18:36.490
"The spring light has come. The spring day has come..."

18:37.559 --> 18:40.690
"to the deep mountain valley and on the golden meadow."

18:42.759 --> 18:44.529
It's a poem by Kim So Wol.

18:44.930 --> 18:47.029
I asked you just out of curiosity.

18:48.200 --> 18:51.099
How do you have the entire poem memorized?

18:52.900 --> 18:56.839
I only have a middle school diploma.

18:57.410 --> 19:00.710
I delivered newspapers to earn money to put my siblings through school,

19:01.579 --> 19:03.109
and it embarrassed me so much.

19:04.150 --> 19:05.150
So,

19:05.650 --> 19:09.190
I stole my friend's high school Korean textbook.

19:09.619 --> 19:11.420
I carried it with me all the time...

19:12.160 --> 19:14.329
and pretended that I was a high school student.

19:14.859 --> 19:17.599
Then one day, I happened to read a few pages in the textbook,

19:18.230 --> 19:20.299
and I was deeply moved by the poem.

19:22.529 --> 19:25.240
I read it so many times that I ended up memorizing it.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.109
Ms. Park.

19:31.579 --> 19:33.680
- Yes, sir. - You don't need to try so hard.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.019
Don't pretend to be who you're not like what I did.

19:37.549 --> 19:41.150
Just keep your native accent.

19:42.190 --> 19:46.490
You don't need to try so hard to sound like a Seoul native.

19:49.660 --> 19:51.029
Let's head home now.

19:51.829 --> 19:53.930
I need to take my medication.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.569
Shall we head back, sir?

19:58.440 --> 20:01.440
I'll call Mr. Kim then.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.680
All right, sure.

20:08.380 --> 20:10.279
My feelings for Mr. Chairman...

20:10.650 --> 20:12.650
weren't entirely fake.

20:13.519 --> 20:14.519
On some days,

20:15.220 --> 20:18.359
I felt horrible for what I was doing to him,

20:19.720 --> 20:21.690
and there were also times when I almost teared up...

20:22.460 --> 20:24.400
because of how much he cared for me.

20:25.630 --> 20:28.799
Nothing in this world is perfectly fake...

20:29.369 --> 20:32.740
or perfectly real.

20:35.440 --> 20:38.279
(Karaoke)

20:46.049 --> 20:47.150
Let's go.

20:48.819 --> 20:51.619
- Bye, Ms. Yun. - Bye, Ji Hu.

20:51.920 --> 20:53.289
Take care, Ms. Yun.

20:53.289 --> 20:54.930
Goodbye, Mr. Ahn.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.259
Let's go.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.319
(The Art of Seduction)

21:38.200 --> 21:41.170
Ji Hu, take your earphones off. Let's listen to it together.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.509
Tune to 91.3FM.

21:43.509 --> 21:45.339
All right, 91.3.

21:50.180 --> 21:54.250
Why do you like to listen to music that was popular before I was born?

21:54.319 --> 21:55.589
You're such an old soul.

21:57.460 --> 22:01.089
Why did the sky abandon me if it really exists?

22:01.930 --> 22:03.829
I'm all alone again.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.029
Goodness.

22:05.200 --> 22:09.130
That's how life is. We keep getting betrayed by the sky.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.200
And all of us are in it alone.

22:11.769 --> 22:14.170
Ji Hu, why do you think so?

22:14.210 --> 22:15.869
You're only 10, so act your age.

22:16.039 --> 22:18.509
You need to look at the world like other 10-year-old kids do.

22:18.680 --> 22:22.009
The fact that I'm young doesn't change how the world is.

22:22.150 --> 22:24.250
If I dismiss the reality just because I'm young,

22:24.250 --> 22:25.720
when it hits me one day...

22:26.079 --> 22:29.250
Like Mom always says, it'll be a total disaster.

22:29.349 --> 22:30.859
Let's say that this is like a warm-up.

22:32.660 --> 22:35.630
You need to watch some cartoons...

22:35.690 --> 22:38.200
to dumb yourself down.

22:38.759 --> 22:40.869
And don't listen to music like this.

22:42.130 --> 22:46.369
Yes, this is better. Listen to songs that make you stop thinking.

22:46.470 --> 22:47.569
Isn't this nice?

22:47.569 --> 22:50.640
That's what dictators did in the medieval times.

22:50.910 --> 22:54.609
They encouraged cultural development to divert people's attention.

22:54.750 --> 22:56.680
They wanted their people to become mindless.

22:58.680 --> 23:00.720
I'm not saying that's what you're doing, Dad.

23:00.849 --> 23:03.589
Regardless of their intentions, the cultural development initiated...

23:03.589 --> 23:05.619
by those dictators will be remembered forever in history.

23:07.960 --> 23:10.900
Do you ever watch cartoons? Like Doraemon for example.

23:11.259 --> 23:12.500
Yes, I like it.

23:13.099 --> 23:14.130
Thank goodness.

23:14.529 --> 23:17.500
Doraemon should have met Shin Chan...

23:17.500 --> 23:19.000
instead of Nobita.

23:19.299 --> 23:21.410
Then, he shouldn't have been able to act out like that.

23:27.410 --> 23:28.450
Hello?

23:43.799 --> 23:46.029
Ms. Park, it must have been a long day for you.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.470
Go get some rest now.

23:49.069 --> 23:51.339
Get a good sleep and rest up, sir.

23:51.740 --> 23:52.799
All right.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.009
I'd like...

24:02.150 --> 24:03.920
to thank you for everything today.

24:17.500 --> 24:18.559
Jae Seok.

24:20.099 --> 24:22.829
- Hello, Ju Mi. - Yes, hello.

24:25.740 --> 24:26.869
A Jin.

24:27.440 --> 24:28.509
Let's go home.

24:28.910 --> 24:29.970
My gosh.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.640
Look who is here. Jae Seok?

24:34.349 --> 24:35.609
You're a cutie.

24:36.779 --> 24:38.150
Let's talk at home.

24:38.549 --> 24:41.650
Hey, did you say hello to Ju Mi?

24:41.990 --> 24:43.619
A Jin, let's go home now.

24:44.720 --> 24:47.430
Ju Mi, you see this guy's face?

24:47.490 --> 24:50.799
His personality is even worse.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.670
Let's get going if you don't want to see me losing it. I'll carry you.

24:53.670 --> 24:56.400
Gosh, I don't need to be carried.

24:57.269 --> 25:00.000
Let me have one more drink. Just one more.

25:00.000 --> 25:02.839
My goodness. Ji Hu is in the car now.

25:05.509 --> 25:06.609
Ji Hu is in the car?

25:09.150 --> 25:10.549
Then, I should sober up.

25:12.019 --> 25:13.390
Both of you, follow me.

25:14.519 --> 25:16.549
Hey, wait. Where should we follow you?

25:16.619 --> 25:18.720
A Jin, where are you going?

25:41.279 --> 25:42.650
The trees on the street should thank you...

25:42.650 --> 25:44.380
for all the fertilizer you gave them.

25:45.849 --> 25:47.619
I'm going to wash up. You should leave for work now.

25:47.720 --> 25:48.750
Gosh.

25:49.349 --> 25:51.490
I'll go say hello to the caregiver before I head to work.

25:51.890 --> 25:54.490
Mr. Kim said that she has been taking such great care of Dad.

25:54.829 --> 25:56.900
There's no need. I have to fire her.

25:57.230 --> 25:59.460
Hey, is this some kind of mind game or what?

25:59.599 --> 26:01.869
You say that every time I'm heading there to meet her.

26:02.000 --> 26:05.299
Gosh. I have no choice because Ju Mi absolutely can't stand her.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.170
Gosh, I can't say it to her.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.109
And where am I going to find another caregiver?

26:10.309 --> 26:11.339
I think I'm experiencing deja vu.

26:11.339 --> 26:13.180
I This is exactly the same as last time.

26:13.480 --> 26:14.549
This is called deja vu, right?

26:26.089 --> 26:27.690
I'm going to work, Father.

26:28.490 --> 26:30.730
All right. Have a good day.

26:42.009 --> 26:44.880
Sir, please try moving your legs now.

26:50.779 --> 26:53.349
I feel like I'll be able to run in no time.

26:54.289 --> 26:55.390
Really?

26:56.589 --> 26:57.690
Let me help you.

27:01.660 --> 27:02.829
Good job.

27:05.829 --> 27:06.930
Put your arm around me.

27:08.200 --> 27:09.230
My goodness.

27:24.619 --> 27:25.779
Sir.

27:29.420 --> 27:31.619
Let's dance.

27:32.259 --> 27:33.289
Dance?

28:50.700 --> 28:52.599
That day, the three of us...

28:53.000 --> 28:56.680
felt the most beautiful sentiments the sky has given us...

28:57.180 --> 28:58.839
while looking at each other.

28:59.440 --> 29:01.750
It was a heartwarming day...

29:02.750 --> 29:06.019
for both me and her.

29:16.460 --> 29:19.299
So? Does that mean you've decided not to fire the caregiver?

29:19.299 --> 29:20.369
Yes.

29:20.400 --> 29:21.670
I think you've made the right decision.

29:21.670 --> 29:23.470
You have such a warm heart.

29:24.039 --> 29:26.809
Right. My husband suggested using one of your artworks...

29:26.809 --> 29:29.009
for the design of our tissue box.

29:29.109 --> 29:31.940
- Really? - I think you'll be paid royalties.

29:32.079 --> 29:34.779
I asked him to include your name in the design...

29:34.779 --> 29:36.309
to help you get your name out there.

29:36.309 --> 29:39.279
I don't need any royalties. I should pay the company.

29:39.619 --> 29:41.490
He asked me to pick a painting.

29:41.490 --> 29:43.119
Please e-mail me photos of your paintings.

29:43.690 --> 29:47.430
It looks like your husband discusses a lot of work matters with you.

29:47.430 --> 29:48.890
Gosh, of course.

29:48.890 --> 29:51.430
Our household can't function without me.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.299
The company will launch menstrual pads soon.

29:54.299 --> 29:57.170
It'll be extremely high-quality. It was my idea.

29:59.170 --> 30:01.339
You've never met my husband, right?

30:01.369 --> 30:04.210
Why? I met him when he came to pick up Ji Hu.

30:04.339 --> 30:05.839
Right.

30:06.009 --> 30:08.579
Let's have a meal together soon. We need to talk about the design.

30:09.049 --> 30:10.079
Okay.

30:10.079 --> 30:12.220
Go in now. The director must be waiting.

30:13.619 --> 30:17.420
For your information, she doesn't like artists who are outspoken.

30:17.420 --> 30:19.190
He has been burnt before.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.529
"She's been good..."

30:23.559 --> 30:24.930
"at mental arithmetic since she was very young,"

30:24.960 --> 30:27.500
"so I focused on helping her further develop the talent."

30:27.569 --> 30:31.240
"My goal for her is to have a higher EQ than IQ."

30:31.339 --> 30:34.109
"Emotional thinking is more important than logical thinking,"

30:34.109 --> 30:35.509
"but I got her to take the test..."

30:35.509 --> 30:38.079
"so that she can learn to challenge herself."

30:38.839 --> 30:40.450
For goodness' sake.

30:40.609 --> 30:42.049
She's so pretentious.

30:42.349 --> 30:45.079
I really can't stand how pretentious A Jin is.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.589
Woo A Jin. I have to admit that she is very pretty.

30:48.690 --> 30:50.089
Isn't her beauty on another level?

30:51.059 --> 30:53.259
I wouldn't say she's pretty. She got work done on her face.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.630
Hate her if you want to, but don't slander her name.

30:55.859 --> 30:57.130
She's all natural.

30:57.529 --> 30:58.930
Besides, it's not easy to become pretty...

30:58.930 --> 31:00.299
even with plastic surgery procedures.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.700
Plastic surgeons can't work their magic...

31:01.700 --> 31:04.369
when you're hopelessly ugly.

31:09.069 --> 31:11.009
"I know what you did in Suite 702."

31:21.289 --> 31:23.319
I must have a natural talent for this.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.220
You sure do.

31:26.220 --> 31:28.359
- Isn't this so pretty? - It is really pretty.

31:28.460 --> 31:29.529
I should start a business.

31:29.930 --> 31:31.299
I think that's a great idea.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.400
Where were we? Finish your story.

31:34.869 --> 31:36.130
Like I told you,

31:36.369 --> 31:39.369
Yun Jae's mom went to Dr. Jang's clinic for fat grafting,

31:39.670 --> 31:42.009
and the two of them fell for each other.

31:42.769 --> 31:44.339
What a disaster.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.240
Here is the latest hot news for you.

31:46.509 --> 31:48.349
It's about Ji Hu's violin teacher.

31:48.509 --> 31:51.920
She went clubbing for the first time in her life...

31:51.920 --> 31:53.490
and met a guy there.

31:54.049 --> 31:57.089
Apparently, they've realized that they are each other's true love.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.759
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

31:59.259 --> 32:01.160
I only heard about it yesterday. Pung Suk told me.

32:01.430 --> 32:04.759
I can't let someone like her teach Ji Hu. That's crazy.

32:05.329 --> 32:06.660
Why can't you?

32:06.799 --> 32:08.869
That story is scandalous.

32:09.369 --> 32:10.839
What about it is scandalous?

32:11.240 --> 32:13.069
They say that artists' loose morals prove...

32:13.069 --> 32:14.809
the existence of their artistic creativity.

32:15.309 --> 32:17.539
Besides, she's divorced anyway.

32:17.740 --> 32:19.240
What's wrong with her dating a guy?

32:20.579 --> 32:22.009
That is true.

32:23.549 --> 32:27.319
But it sounds funny to me that she met her true love...

32:27.390 --> 32:28.549
at a club.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.819
It was that guy's first time going clubbing too.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.759
There's nothing romantic about where they first met, but...

32:37.460 --> 32:40.500
I feel like it's been 5,000 years since the last time I went clubbing.

32:40.569 --> 32:41.799
I miss it.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.200
I used to go clubbing all the time before I got married.

32:44.299 --> 32:46.599
I still remember the names of the waiters at Hotel Infra's club.

32:46.599 --> 32:48.710
Ho Sik, Sam Dol, and Charles.

32:49.470 --> 32:51.880
They could earn a living thanks to me.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.380
I wonder what kind of work they do now.

32:54.210 --> 32:57.750
They used to grab my wrist like this and drag me around the club.

32:59.980 --> 33:02.619
One more thing. Do you want to hear something totally crazy?

33:02.619 --> 33:04.460
- What is it? - You know Su Min's mom, right?

33:04.460 --> 33:06.460
- The wife of Grand Pix Hotels' CEO. - Yes.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.190
Bring some cold green tea.

33:09.190 --> 33:10.900
I want to pour it over rice and dried corvina.

33:11.099 --> 33:14.470
I heard that he bought his mistress a house and a car,

33:14.670 --> 33:15.930
and she even visits him at home.

33:15.930 --> 33:17.339
Gosh, are you serious?

33:18.299 --> 33:20.609
The problem is his wife knows about it,

33:20.609 --> 33:22.210
but she's just putting up with it.

33:22.339 --> 33:25.039
No way. How can she put up with that? I'm sure she has no idea.

33:25.109 --> 33:28.279
She does know. His mistress is only 23,

33:28.279 --> 33:29.880
and she refers to Su Min's mom as his first wife.

33:30.480 --> 33:31.579
One more thing.

33:31.619 --> 33:34.190
I heard that Yun Jae's dad...

33:34.190 --> 33:36.490
hits his wife once in a while.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.660
Hey, are you out of your mind?

33:40.660 --> 33:42.329
My gosh, what a jerk.

33:42.359 --> 33:43.430
That's obviously why she has fallen...

33:43.460 --> 33:45.829
or Dr. Jang who's gentle and warmhearted.

33:46.869 --> 33:50.299
Jae Seok is ignorant and he talks nonsense often,

33:50.299 --> 33:52.170
but he's such a great husband.

33:52.670 --> 33:53.769
Don't you think so?

33:54.440 --> 33:55.710
So far, yes.

33:56.609 --> 33:57.809
So far?

33:59.309 --> 34:03.009
My mom told me to never trust men.

34:06.789 --> 34:08.090
- Sir. - Yes.

34:08.420 --> 34:10.360
We should stop here for today.

34:10.889 --> 34:11.920
Shall we?

34:12.219 --> 34:13.219
Yes.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.889
- All right then. - Please don't push yourself.

34:16.059 --> 34:17.059
Okay.

34:21.130 --> 34:23.000
It must have caused stress on the joints.

34:36.150 --> 34:37.650
- Ms. Park. - Yes.

34:38.550 --> 34:39.619
Bok Ja.

34:43.320 --> 34:44.360
Yes.

34:44.559 --> 34:46.090
Is there anything you want?

34:46.760 --> 34:48.190
What do you want to buy the most?

34:49.730 --> 34:51.260
It's okay. You can tell me.

34:51.360 --> 34:53.570
- I don't want anything. - Why isn't there any?

34:55.500 --> 34:56.630
There is one thing, but...

34:57.300 --> 35:01.539
I've been wanting to buy a bag that I can carry like this.

35:01.610 --> 35:03.309
You know that my hearing is bad.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.079
Say it louder.

35:05.139 --> 35:07.309
Goodness, you startled me.

35:07.809 --> 35:10.119
A bag. I want to buy a bag.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.519
Just a bag? Is that all you want?

35:14.650 --> 35:17.090
My gosh. "Just a bag"?

35:17.190 --> 35:18.889
Call Mr. Kim.

35:19.989 --> 35:22.090
- Why? - So that you can go buy a bag.

35:22.730 --> 35:23.929
Buy other things too.

35:24.030 --> 35:26.559
Get yourself some new clothes and new shoes as well.

35:29.369 --> 35:30.570
Are you being serious now?

35:31.239 --> 35:33.739
Gosh. It's okay, sir.

35:34.110 --> 35:35.210
Do as I say!

35:50.489 --> 35:52.889
Mr. Chairman told me to make sure you get the most expensive ones.

36:09.909 --> 36:13.610
I'm sorry. I need to use the washroom.

36:13.750 --> 36:14.750
Sure.

37:45.469 --> 37:47.469
Ms. Park, this is...

37:49.639 --> 37:52.010
Do you think that I'll let a piece of trash like you...

37:52.239 --> 37:53.610
have your way?

37:58.980 --> 38:02.289
A lowborn woman like you doesn't even deserve these things.

38:04.619 --> 38:06.460
Know your place, Park Bok Ja.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.829
You're just a maid here.

38:09.090 --> 38:11.630
My father-in-law's caregiver. Do you understand?

39:20.670 --> 39:22.099
(Ms. Kim, please call me.)

39:46.119 --> 39:48.260
- Hello? - I'm calling from Suite 702.

39:49.429 --> 39:50.630
Who are you?

39:50.860 --> 39:53.300
Let's meet up in Seoul. I'll tell you in person.

39:53.369 --> 39:54.469
I asked you who you are.

39:54.800 --> 39:56.329
I work at the residence.

39:57.469 --> 39:59.699
Will you be okay to come to my area tomorrow afternoon?

39:59.969 --> 40:02.210
I'll send you my address.

40:11.380 --> 40:12.650
Bring her back immediately!

40:12.949 --> 40:15.219
We'll find another caregiver as soon as possible.

40:15.519 --> 40:16.789
What? Another caregiver?

40:17.320 --> 40:18.889
Ju Mi, you kicked her out, didn't you?

40:19.059 --> 40:22.530
Father, I'll get a hold of her and make sure to bring her back.

40:22.590 --> 40:24.260
She's not picking up!

40:24.730 --> 40:27.699
I'll make sure to bring her back, Father.

40:27.929 --> 40:30.699
Dad, trust A Jin and wait for a few days.

40:30.800 --> 40:31.969
And please make sure you eat.

40:32.369 --> 40:35.940
I've been able to enjoy life that other people have.

40:36.639 --> 40:40.250
I've been laughing a lot because she made me so happy.

40:40.949 --> 40:44.019
Ju Mi, what on earth did you say to her?

40:44.119 --> 40:45.880
I told her that she should know her place.

40:47.449 --> 40:51.190
When I saw her holding the designer bag and shoes you bought for her,

40:51.820 --> 40:53.360
I got so upset.

40:54.559 --> 40:58.360
Even I don't own a designer bag. Why should a caregiver have one?

40:58.829 --> 41:01.400
She made you happy? That woman?

41:02.130 --> 41:04.869
That's why we hired her. We pay her to do that.

41:04.940 --> 41:05.969
Get out!

41:07.809 --> 41:11.079
If we can't find her,

41:11.480 --> 41:14.610
both you and Un Gyu will be kicked out of this house.

41:15.949 --> 41:18.579
Ms. Jo, please call Mr. Kim.

41:35.469 --> 41:37.769
You saw that, right? Do you still think that I'm wrong?

41:37.869 --> 41:39.199
I'll find her. We must meet with her.

41:39.269 --> 41:40.869
No, don't meet with her. Don't find her.

41:41.639 --> 41:42.670
Ju Mi.

41:43.380 --> 41:44.840
She'll probably answer your call.

41:44.940 --> 41:46.849
Meet up with her and persuade her to come back.

41:47.650 --> 41:48.650
Okay.

41:49.409 --> 41:50.449
What a headache.

42:19.440 --> 42:22.079
(Beautiful Ms. Woo)

42:37.699 --> 42:39.230
Are you away on a trip or something?

42:39.559 --> 42:42.699
You should have given us a heads-up. Father is looking for you.

42:42.969 --> 42:44.900
He might call the police to report you missing...

42:44.900 --> 42:46.340
if we don't hear from you.

42:53.280 --> 42:54.349
It's me.

42:54.809 --> 42:57.480
Please don't bother to file a missing-person report.

42:59.420 --> 43:00.420
Let's meet.

43:04.119 --> 43:05.190
What?

43:05.320 --> 43:06.989
She spoke with no accent just now.

43:19.869 --> 43:21.869
- You... - Hello, Ms. Kim.

43:21.940 --> 43:23.070
What's this ruse?

43:23.809 --> 43:24.940
Shall I teach you a lesson?

43:25.940 --> 43:27.480
I saw the man...

43:27.809 --> 43:30.349
who stayed in Suite 508 walking out of your room.

43:32.619 --> 43:34.449
He is a close friend of mine.

43:34.849 --> 43:36.760
We ran into each other, so we had tea together.

43:37.820 --> 43:40.489
Don't you know that I invite my friends to my room once in a while?

43:40.690 --> 43:42.659
We have parties there and play cards too.

43:42.730 --> 43:44.230
- I know. - Then?

43:44.329 --> 43:46.400
I did some digging on that man, Choi Gi Seok,

43:46.530 --> 43:48.099
and found out that he stayed at our residence...

43:48.199 --> 43:50.170
on all the days that you came.

43:51.440 --> 43:54.670
- Have you been watching me? - Gosh, of course not.

43:55.010 --> 43:56.780
I've been working hard, that's all.

43:57.880 --> 44:00.780
I've never even seen that guy drink a bottle of water in his room.

44:00.849 --> 44:03.719
Isn't it bizarre? It didn't look like he slept in the room at all.

44:04.079 --> 44:07.920
From the toothpaste and toothbrush to the towels, nothing was used.

44:09.820 --> 44:11.059
What is it that you want?

44:13.159 --> 44:15.690
I'd just like 30,000 dollars in cash.

44:18.460 --> 44:20.670
I won't be greedy and ask you for more later on.

44:21.469 --> 44:25.440
You just said you won't ask for more. Can I trust you on that?

44:25.539 --> 44:26.570
Of course.

44:27.469 --> 44:30.239
Also, there is one more thing.

44:31.739 --> 44:33.880
Please get me promoted to room division manager.

44:34.880 --> 44:38.519
I'm on a contract now. Please make me a permanent employee.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.449
That's all I want.

44:44.989 --> 44:46.730
All right. Instead,

44:47.460 --> 44:49.690
you and I will take this secret to the grave, okay?

44:49.829 --> 44:51.860
Your secret is safe with me. Then.

45:07.610 --> 45:09.380
Did Father buy you that coat?

45:12.449 --> 45:13.889
It looks amazing on you.

45:14.250 --> 45:16.150
It goes very well with the bag too.

45:19.190 --> 45:21.590
I knew it. You have such great taste.

45:22.389 --> 45:25.699
You shouldn't clean those shoes with a regular leather cleaner.

45:25.760 --> 45:27.199
You can't use water either.

45:27.269 --> 45:29.329
Calfskin is tricky to take care of.

45:29.869 --> 45:31.940
- Then... - You can use a soft brush.

45:32.070 --> 45:35.409
You should clean it with a toothbrush with soft, fine bristles.

45:35.570 --> 45:38.780
If they get a stain, mix detergent and shampoo in a 1-to-1 ratio,

45:38.880 --> 45:41.510
then use a minute amount of the mixture to remove the stain.

45:49.750 --> 45:50.989
Please open it.

45:54.829 --> 45:56.389
I made it.

45:58.130 --> 45:59.230
It's beautiful.

45:59.329 --> 46:03.329
It goes so well with your clothes, shoes, and bag.

46:05.739 --> 46:07.210
You should come over to my place.

46:07.869 --> 46:11.280
I've made so many like this. I'll give you the ones you want.

46:11.610 --> 46:13.239
- Really? - Yes.

46:13.980 --> 46:16.949
I should have invited you over for a meal a long time ago.

46:18.480 --> 46:19.519
Ms. Park.

46:20.190 --> 46:21.519
Please come back.

46:21.690 --> 46:23.289
Father cried.

46:24.659 --> 46:27.690
- Why did he cry? - He must miss you a lot.

46:27.960 --> 46:29.590
So, let's go now.

46:36.030 --> 46:38.000
I'll drag you if you don't come with me.

46:47.710 --> 46:48.710
Gosh.

46:48.780 --> 46:50.949
I never asked you to give it to me.

46:51.019 --> 46:52.679
Ms. Woo, why are you being like this?

46:52.780 --> 46:55.789
It looks better on you. Keep it.

46:56.119 --> 46:57.260
It's so pretty on you.

46:58.289 --> 47:01.289
By the way, you can sound like a Seoul native.

47:01.360 --> 47:04.329
I know, right? I can talk without the accent.

47:23.420 --> 47:24.650
Sir.

47:36.360 --> 47:37.530
You're back.

47:37.530 --> 47:39.699
"After all, tomorrow is another day."

47:40.070 --> 47:42.070
That's what Scarlett O'Hara said.

47:46.039 --> 47:47.539
I don't even know anymore.

48:16.900 --> 48:18.500
- Namaste. - Namaste.

48:30.250 --> 48:31.679
She comes to our clinic.

48:31.780 --> 48:33.320
She wants to get fillers done on her eyelids.

48:34.119 --> 48:37.989
Mistresses must work harder to take care of their looks...

48:37.989 --> 48:39.090
because it's their weapon.

48:39.889 --> 48:43.059
Why do women try so hard to impress men? It annoys me so much.

48:43.659 --> 48:47.630
Men stink of cigarettes, get big bellies, and go bald.

48:48.429 --> 48:52.070
- Is something going on with you? - Life is a series of problems.

48:52.599 --> 48:55.369
Also, are you really going to keep Ji Hu at that math institute?

48:55.940 --> 48:57.280
I already told you that I will.

48:57.380 --> 49:00.909
Don't be so stubborn and join us. Ms. Baek brought it upon herself.

49:01.010 --> 49:03.820
Because of those 2 kids, 14 students in the advanced class have quit.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.989
She's not running an institution. She needs to rethink her approach...

49:07.289 --> 49:09.250
because she's in the service industry after all.

49:09.320 --> 49:12.260
I really can't understand the moms who are getting their kids...

49:12.320 --> 49:13.690
to quit because of such reasons.

49:14.190 --> 49:15.760
Sometimes, you have to memorize things...

49:15.829 --> 49:18.199
that you don't understand in order to go with the tide.

49:18.400 --> 49:20.000
Just memorize it if you can't understand it.

49:20.630 --> 49:22.530
I don't think I can do that because I'm not smart.

49:23.099 --> 49:24.670
You're really stubborn.

49:26.300 --> 49:27.809
You'll come to the brunch tomorrow, right?

49:27.940 --> 49:29.670
Of course. I already paid the membership fees.

49:30.039 --> 49:31.480
I knew you'd say that.

49:34.710 --> 49:36.780
Slowly.

49:38.219 --> 49:40.090
- Good. - Gosh, that feels nice.

49:41.519 --> 49:43.719
Shall we have noodle soup for lunch?

49:44.519 --> 49:45.719
Is that what you'd like to eat?

49:46.730 --> 49:50.230
Sure, I'll make it quick.

49:51.230 --> 49:52.300
Where did you sleep?

49:53.400 --> 49:54.400
At a motel.

49:54.630 --> 49:57.269
Don't you have anywhere to stay besides my place?

49:58.139 --> 50:01.309
I was renting an apartment, but I needed the deposit to pay my debt.

50:01.440 --> 50:02.639
How much debt do you have?

50:02.940 --> 50:06.710
I moved in here because Ms. Woo said that she would raise my pay.

50:06.809 --> 50:08.909
I'll be able to pay it off after working for a full year.

50:09.010 --> 50:10.250
I'll pay it off for you.

50:11.420 --> 50:13.019
It's okay, sir.

50:13.079 --> 50:14.250
No.

50:15.389 --> 50:17.090
I've lived my life wrong.

50:17.559 --> 50:20.429
None of my children turned out the way I wanted them to,

50:21.090 --> 50:24.360
and my wife died young due to an illness.

50:25.130 --> 50:28.469
It's not like I'm going to take all the money with me when I die.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.099
I'll clear your debt for you.

50:30.699 --> 50:31.800
How much do you owe in total?

50:42.309 --> 50:44.820
So, are you saying that Ms. Park told you to clean my place...

50:44.920 --> 50:46.849
twice a week?

50:47.019 --> 50:50.360
She also told me to clean Mr. Chairman's house 4 times a week.

50:51.090 --> 50:53.019
Why didn't she discuss it with me first?

50:53.119 --> 50:57.860
I thought your housekeeper was returning after her maternity leave.

50:59.199 --> 51:02.030
Let's follow that schedule for now. Twice here and four times there.

51:06.369 --> 51:08.869
Gosh, your place is so nice.

51:08.940 --> 51:11.110
It's beautifully decorated.

51:11.210 --> 51:12.909
- Ms. Park. - Yes.

51:13.309 --> 51:16.650
Please make sure you discuss everything with me or Ju Mi first.

51:17.719 --> 51:18.750
What do you mean...

51:18.820 --> 51:22.449
It's about Ms. Jo. I heard you told her to clean my place twice a week.

51:24.260 --> 51:25.489
About that.

51:25.860 --> 51:28.690
It didn't look like you had a housekeeper.

51:28.860 --> 51:31.360
I thought it'd be too much work for you to clean your place alone,

51:31.559 --> 51:34.030
so I just wanted to help.

51:35.170 --> 51:36.570
Did it upset you?

51:36.670 --> 51:38.239
I appreciate you want to help,

51:38.570 --> 51:41.070
but there are two daughters-in-law in the family.

51:41.440 --> 51:42.539
I know that, of course.

51:42.610 --> 51:45.880
Ju Mi is in an awkward position now because her husband has fallen...

51:45.940 --> 51:49.610
out of favor with his father, but she still is the lady of the house.

51:50.219 --> 51:52.250
Please respect her opinions.

51:52.320 --> 51:55.349
Let me correct that. Please do as Ju Mi says.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.929
I'd like you to get her permission before making any decisions.

52:06.059 --> 52:07.230
Okay, I will.

52:09.599 --> 52:10.800
I got the message.

52:12.900 --> 52:13.940
You should get some rest now.

52:15.070 --> 52:16.110
Wait.

52:16.469 --> 52:18.179
From now on, Ju Mi will pay you as well.

52:18.280 --> 52:20.449
I'll speak to her about it.

52:42.670 --> 52:43.670
Well...

52:44.800 --> 52:46.739
There's a temporary front desk clerk...

52:46.809 --> 52:48.639
named Kim Eun Seok at the Songdo residence.

52:48.739 --> 52:49.769
Who is that?

52:51.309 --> 52:54.050
I've been observing him for a while,

52:54.679 --> 52:56.820
and he's really good at what he does.

52:57.280 --> 52:59.079
Can you give him a permanent position?

52:59.650 --> 53:00.889
Why do you even care?

53:01.150 --> 53:03.119
You need to groom talent...

53:03.119 --> 53:05.420
in order to make it big in the hotel industry.

53:05.690 --> 53:08.590
Let's be honest. All of your employees are temporary workers,

53:08.690 --> 53:09.960
and it's not even a five-star hotel.

53:10.059 --> 53:12.099
They have no pride because it's just a residence,

53:12.230 --> 53:14.030
so they can quit anytime.

53:14.900 --> 53:17.769
I think that he is really good at his job.

53:17.900 --> 53:20.469
- What is his name again? - Kim Eun Seok.

53:28.309 --> 53:29.380
You wench!

53:31.280 --> 53:33.179
I've been waiting for you. Come on in.

53:33.889 --> 53:34.920
Have a seat.

53:35.519 --> 53:37.090
- He's the psychic. - I see.

53:39.059 --> 53:41.889
- And among your family members... - My gosh!

53:42.190 --> 53:44.030
Your mom is your favorite.

53:44.300 --> 53:47.730
Gosh, he is so accurate. He is really good.

53:52.599 --> 53:53.710
Your wife...

53:54.070 --> 53:56.980
I mean, Ji Hu's mom. You must've married her because you love her.

53:57.309 --> 53:58.309
Of course.

53:58.440 --> 53:59.780
She used to be drop-dead gorgeous.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.679
She is still gorgeous.

54:01.980 --> 54:05.079
She is not as hot as she used to be.

54:10.059 --> 54:13.389
We shouldn't have had tteokbokki together that day.

54:14.260 --> 54:18.260
I shouldn't have invited you in that day.

54:19.599 --> 54:20.599
This is so...

54:22.329 --> 54:23.699
This is killing me.

54:24.440 --> 54:25.599
What's killing you?

54:25.670 --> 54:29.340
The fact that I've fallen for a married man.

54:29.440 --> 54:31.809
Well, that's not even a big deal nowadays.

54:32.010 --> 54:35.179
Who cares about such a thing? You sound so old-fashioned.

54:36.380 --> 54:37.380
No.

54:37.820 --> 54:39.250
Let's stop here.

54:39.480 --> 54:42.920
We haven't even done anything. What's there to stop?

54:43.019 --> 54:46.289
I don't want to feel guilty or be secretive about the person I love.

54:48.030 --> 54:49.460
I'm just not cut out for it.

54:49.559 --> 54:50.800
But I'm okay with it.

54:53.429 --> 54:56.900
I'll make sure she never finds out.

54:57.469 --> 55:01.139
A Jin is more simple-minded than you think. I bet she has no idea.

55:01.510 --> 55:05.710
I'll make sure that she never finds out, so just trust me. Okay?

55:09.579 --> 55:10.820
The sirloin is very good.

55:11.019 --> 55:13.389
This is on me, so you should have another one.

55:27.570 --> 55:29.900
Ms. Woo wants me to get paid directly from you...

55:30.769 --> 55:34.170
and get your permission on everything...

55:34.610 --> 55:36.679
- from now on. - I heard.

55:38.010 --> 55:39.010
I see.

55:40.550 --> 55:41.579
First off,

55:42.079 --> 55:44.349
I want you to move out of this house.

55:44.849 --> 55:47.449
You'll come here in the morning and leave when your day is done.

55:48.489 --> 55:50.320
- Why? - It's because we never planned...

55:50.420 --> 55:53.489
to hire a live-in caregiver if you must ask.

55:57.300 --> 55:58.360
Okay.

56:00.230 --> 56:01.530
I'll move out.

56:02.300 --> 56:05.340
Is there anything else you'd like to say?

56:06.500 --> 56:07.840
That's all for today.

56:08.769 --> 56:11.510
Then, when should I move my stuff out of the house?

56:11.639 --> 56:12.880
As soon as possible.

56:13.780 --> 56:14.809
Okay.

56:16.250 --> 56:19.420
I'll be living with Mr. Chairman,

56:19.980 --> 56:21.550
so I guess the place should be pretty big.

56:22.050 --> 56:24.289
He wouldn't want to live in a small place...

56:24.420 --> 56:26.360
since he's used to this mansion.

56:26.760 --> 56:27.789
What do you mean by that?

56:28.530 --> 56:31.000
Did you want me to move out by myself?

56:36.199 --> 56:38.599
If I do, your father-in-law will probably faint from emotional shock.

56:39.400 --> 56:40.909
Is that your goal?

56:41.610 --> 56:45.340
Are you doing this so that your husband can inherit his money soon?

56:46.380 --> 56:48.780
Is that what you want, ma'am?

56:53.789 --> 56:57.320
Don't provoke me, please.

56:58.590 --> 56:59.789
If you don't behave yourself,

57:02.630 --> 57:04.000
you'll get kicked out.

57:27.690 --> 57:29.190
Please take me home.

57:30.190 --> 57:31.190
Well...

57:33.119 --> 57:34.190
Let's kiss.

57:34.960 --> 57:36.289
Sorry? My gosh.

57:36.389 --> 57:38.800
I've been wondering what I can do to express my feelings for you...

57:39.199 --> 57:41.900
and have come to this decision after thinking for two and a half hours.

57:42.800 --> 57:43.840
Let's kiss.

57:46.099 --> 57:49.440
It will help us decide which way our relationship should take.

58:23.070 --> 58:24.409
Gosh. Are you okay?

58:45.860 --> 58:48.070
- Have you had dinner yet? - Yes.

58:49.500 --> 58:53.340
You must be working hard these days. You have lost weight.

58:54.210 --> 58:55.210
I know, right?

58:55.639 --> 58:58.579
Make me some stamina-boosting foods with eels or deer antlers.

58:58.679 --> 59:00.650
They aren't compatible with your constitution.

59:00.710 --> 59:02.750
I'll get the anti-fatigue herbal pills made.

59:03.550 --> 59:05.519
Gosh. I'm so proud of you, Jae Seok.

59:09.389 --> 59:11.719
Let's take a family trip. It's been too long.

59:11.920 --> 59:14.460
- What's with a family trip? - We haven't taken one in a while.

59:14.530 --> 59:16.329
We see each other every day.

59:16.329 --> 59:18.030
Then, why do you eat every day?

59:19.329 --> 59:20.329
A Jin.

59:20.500 --> 59:21.530
What?

59:23.170 --> 59:24.199
Never mind.

59:24.639 --> 59:25.639
I'm going to bed.

59:31.880 --> 59:32.980
What was that about?

01:00:02.039 --> 01:00:03.039
The groom is entering now.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:34.210
Dad!

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.380
Dad!

01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:42.349
How can you get re-married?

01:00:42.409 --> 01:00:45.519
I want to do it too. I want to get married twice like you.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:48.590
Why can't I do it? Let go of me!

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.219
Dad, I want to become like you.

01:00:52.519 --> 01:00:54.530
I'll get married twice too.

01:00:55.559 --> 01:00:56.659
Dad!

01:02:18.809 --> 01:02:22.349
(Ju Mi)

01:02:25.949 --> 01:02:26.949
Hello?

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:28.690
A Jin.

01:02:30.389 --> 01:02:31.789
Can you come over for a few minutes?

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:11.360
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:03:11.829 --> 01:03:13.769
What you did is simply wrong.

01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:17.800
It was a mistake. Please give me a chance, Ms. Woo.

01:03:17.869 --> 01:03:19.539
She's one sneaky, scary woman.

01:03:19.639 --> 01:03:21.710
I bet she moved in here with an ulterior motive.

01:03:22.070 --> 01:03:24.610
I told you to never come into my room.

01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:26.510
Do you think that things will change...

01:03:26.579 --> 01:03:28.179
just because you and Father slept together?

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.349
How much is your debt?

01:03:29.579 --> 01:03:31.949
Call them immediately and pay it off right away.

01:03:36.250 --> 01:03:39.389
She was young and pretty. What if he's having an affair with her?

01:03:39.619 --> 01:03:41.130
Good luck. I hope all goes well.

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.260
Thanks.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:46.099
I'll devote myself to you...

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:49.469
and work harder to take great care of you.

01:03:49.630 --> 01:03:51.039
She seemed like a good person.

01:03:51.139 --> 01:03:53.869
She was convicted of fraud and embezzlement seven years ago.

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:55.969
I want you gone first thing tomorrow.

01:03:56.039 --> 01:03:59.880
You'd better watch out from now on. You might end up behind bars...

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:04.219
before I get kicked out of this house.
