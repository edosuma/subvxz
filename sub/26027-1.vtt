00:29.796 --> 00:31.150
Come on, come on.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.783
Owe, owe, owe.

00:32.785 --> 00:35.356
- Come on, hurry up.
- Wee!

00:35.358 --> 00:36.884
Owe, watch it.

00:36.886 --> 00:39.421
- Yeah!
- That's not fair!

00:39.423 --> 00:40.986
Guys, guys, we got to keep
going.

00:40.988 --> 00:43.454
Move over.

00:45.297 --> 00:46.897
Please pipe down!

00:56.073 --> 00:57.739
- Open the window.
- Tell your mom,

00:57.741 --> 00:58.852
at least that's done.

01:00.384 --> 01:02.084
Patty!

01:02.086 --> 01:02.953
Huh?

01:02.955 --> 01:05.456
Oh, Jennifer, hi.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.785
Oh, hi Luis, I need
you to answer a question

01:07.787 --> 01:09.175
for a school news survey, okay?

01:09.177 --> 01:10.217
Uh, okay.

01:10.219 --> 01:11.192
Patty, you ready?

01:12.688 --> 01:15.432
Luis, on a scale of 1 to
10, how would you rate

01:15.434 --> 01:17.864
this recent school trip
to Dragon's Peak Mountain?

01:17.866 --> 01:20.819
Uh, ah, have you seen my shoe?

01:20.821 --> 01:21.688
It's yellow.

01:21.690 --> 01:22.801
I'm the journalist,

01:22.803 --> 01:24.052
I'll ask the questions here,
Luis.

01:24.054 --> 01:26.033
Hey, Louise!

01:26.035 --> 01:26.971
This yours?

01:26.973 --> 01:29.056
Give it back, Marlon!

01:29.058 --> 01:30.342
Got it!

01:30.344 --> 01:32.013
Hey Marlon go long.

01:36.915 --> 01:37.784
Hey, catch!

01:40.460 --> 01:41.604
- There.
- Thanks.

01:41.606 --> 01:43.551
Now, back to business.

01:43.553 --> 01:45.429
Still waiting for your
answer there, champ.

01:45.431 --> 01:48.105
Um, I don't know, 5?

01:48.107 --> 01:49.912
Jolly, thanks.

01:49.914 --> 01:51.895
Get that Patty, Patty?

02:07.536 --> 02:08.473
- Yay, yah.
- Oh.

02:08.476 --> 02:11.254
Order, children, order is
everything.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.208
- There you are.
- Come on.

02:15.983 --> 02:18.379
Marlon, look
at the state of you!

02:18.381 --> 02:20.502
- Huh?
- What will people say, huh?

02:23.420 --> 02:24.289
Uh, Mom.

02:32.631 --> 02:33.327
Huh?

02:38.089 --> 02:38.956
Luis!

02:39.654 --> 02:41.111
Why are you still here?

02:41.113 --> 02:42.781
Did your father forget
to pick you up again?

02:42.783 --> 02:46.429
Uh no, he's just very
busy trying to, you know,

02:46.431 --> 02:47.576
well he's, uh...

02:47.578 --> 02:49.001
You'll never get home on that.

02:49.003 --> 02:50.739
Come on, I'll give you a ride
home!

02:50.741 --> 02:51.642
What?

02:51.644 --> 02:53.868
No, that's not necessary!

02:53.870 --> 02:56.542
It's, it's no problem, really.

02:58.631 --> 03:00.126
Watch where you going.

03:32.590 --> 03:33.873
Hey, boy!

03:33.876 --> 03:36.829
That bike looks like it
belongs on a scrapheap.

03:36.831 --> 03:39.434
I'm getting a new one,
tomorrow is my birthday.

03:39.436 --> 03:42.529
Oh I, have an ice birthday!

03:42.531 --> 03:43.676
Did you hear what I did there?

03:43.678 --> 03:45.657
Because I am an ice cream man,
you see,

03:45.659 --> 03:48.961
I'm selling ice cream.

04:14.300 --> 04:15.931
Not to criticize,

04:15.933 --> 04:19.997
but that last snip left
much to be desired, darling.

04:24.518 --> 04:29.070
Hey Louise, what took
you so long?

04:29.072 --> 04:31.920
Child, look at the state
of your house and lawn.

04:31.922 --> 04:33.241
They're a disgrace!

04:33.243 --> 04:35.639
We're all sick of it!

04:35.641 --> 04:36.925
Yes, Mr. Winter.

04:36.927 --> 04:38.870
And tell your father
the block association

04:38.872 --> 04:42.592
is considering discussing
taking steps, steps, Louise!

04:43.601 --> 04:46.170
Unacceptable, there's
no other word for it.

04:46.172 --> 04:48.676
It's absolutely unacceptable.

04:52.672 --> 04:53.573
Huh?

05:17.525 --> 05:20.442
Who, what, huh, who's there?

05:20.444 --> 05:22.007
It's only me, Luis.

05:22.009 --> 05:23.363
Lu, what, there?

05:23.365 --> 05:24.961
I'm back from the school trip.

05:24.963 --> 05:26.698
Dragon's Peak, remember?

05:26.701 --> 05:30.280
Luis, you're so tall!

05:30.282 --> 05:31.533
How long were you gone?

05:32.576 --> 05:34.067
Four days, Dad.

05:34.069 --> 05:36.084
Ah, four days.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.169
No wonder I'm so hungry.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.664
What time is it, huh?

05:39.666 --> 05:40.533
Just after six.

05:40.535 --> 05:43.487
Ah, almost dark.

05:43.489 --> 05:46.580
Time to get up and get to work!

06:15.779 --> 06:20.055
Huh?

06:36.878 --> 06:38.441
Here's your breakfast.

06:38.443 --> 06:41.081
Right, that's six
degrees north.

06:41.083 --> 06:44.140
And I have a cake baking in
the oven,

06:44.142 --> 06:46.643
a birthday cake for tomorrow.

06:46.645 --> 06:48.763
Good, good, ovens are
good.

06:48.765 --> 06:51.509
- Ah, Okay, 1, 2,
- A raisin cake,

06:51.511 --> 06:53.839
- 3, 4.
- Like Mom used to make.

06:55.091 --> 06:56.132
And, Dad?

06:56.134 --> 06:59.156
I found another bunch
of bills in the trash.

06:59.158 --> 07:02.632
If we don't start paying them
soon they,

07:02.634 --> 07:04.995
they say they're gonna
turn off the electricity

07:04.997 --> 07:05.864
- and the
- Ah, that's very interesting.

07:05.866 --> 07:06.870
Yes, yes, Yes.

07:06.872 --> 07:07.809
But, Dad!

07:07.811 --> 07:11.042
Luis, please. I have to
concentrate.

07:11.044 --> 07:13.093
There is intelligent
life out there somewhere!

07:13.095 --> 07:15.181
And your father has to find it.

07:18.344 --> 07:21.123
Come here my boy, let me tell
you a story.

07:21.126 --> 07:24.078
A long time ago, when I was just
seven,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.005
I encountered a real
alien here on earth."

07:28.007 --> 07:29.395
It was monstrous!

07:29.397 --> 07:32.350
Vile to behold, truly
frightening!

07:32.352 --> 07:35.304
It tried to abduct me, but I
escaped.

07:35.306 --> 07:37.633
Nobody believes me, of
course

07:37.635 --> 07:39.232
but one day, I will...

07:39.234 --> 07:41.875
Dad, you've told me this
3 thousand-billion times.

07:42.919 --> 07:43.819
What's that?

07:43.821 --> 07:45.977
It's the kitchen timer for my
cake.

07:47.089 --> 07:50.390
Ah, ah, well, then, where was
I?

08:05.372 --> 08:07.282
Look at that!

08:07.284 --> 08:08.845
Oh my goodness.

08:08.847 --> 08:12.147
All right, sweetheart,
it's only a tiny speck.

08:12.150 --> 08:14.304
Let's dial it back to DefCon 3,
shall we?

08:14.306 --> 08:18.961
Now it's a tiny speck, but
tomorrow it could be a smudge.

08:18.963 --> 08:20.976
The next day, a glop!

08:20.978 --> 08:24.453
I really need your support here,
darling.

08:24.455 --> 08:26.155
Yes, dear.

08:26.157 --> 08:31.404
I am calm, nothing upsets
me, I am totally relaxed.

08:31.406 --> 08:32.760
What's up dawgs?

08:32.763 --> 08:36.513
Don't call us dawgs, dear
and tuck your shirt in!

08:36.515 --> 08:37.558
Whatever.

08:38.844 --> 08:40.788
And don't forget that
Sarah's school play

08:40.789 --> 08:42.422
is this afternoon!

08:42.424 --> 08:43.917
Oh that's whack, yo.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.238
Do I really gotta go?

08:45.240 --> 08:46.975
Oh you'll be there!

08:46.977 --> 08:48.227
I'm taking time off work

08:48.229 --> 08:51.147
to see our snookums stunning
performance.

08:52.190 --> 08:53.196
I'm a princess!

08:53.198 --> 08:55.805
You're a royal pain with a
booger brain.

08:55.807 --> 08:57.786
Marlon, be nice to your
sister.

08:57.788 --> 08:59.037
No.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.671
Well, I tried.

09:04.321 --> 09:07.518
I am a butterfly in
the eye of a hurricane.

09:07.520 --> 09:10.890
I am fragile and beautiful, but
safe.

09:19.616 --> 09:20.309
Good morning, son!

09:20.311 --> 09:22.987
Today is a very special day!

09:24.239 --> 09:25.661
Close your eyes, Luis.

09:25.663 --> 09:27.505
I have a big surprise for you.

09:29.347 --> 09:32.856
And open, huh?

09:32.858 --> 09:33.968
There were patterned
irregularities

09:33.970 --> 09:35.464
in the ambient noise last night

09:35.466 --> 09:39.147
and your father recorded
them successfully.

09:39.150 --> 09:40.260
Look!

09:40.262 --> 09:42.518
For so long I've been
sending signals into space

09:42.520 --> 09:45.439
and now I finally picked
up something like this!

09:45.441 --> 09:46.726
You know what that means?

09:46.728 --> 09:50.756
There are unidentified flying
objects in our solar system!

09:50.758 --> 09:52.147
Isn't that exciting?

09:52.150 --> 09:54.685
There's a chance that they
could land here on earth

09:54.687 --> 09:58.892
and this time I will
be ready!

10:04.418 --> 10:05.425
What's the matter?

10:05.427 --> 10:07.197
Aren't you happy for me?

10:07.200 --> 10:08.240
Yes, I am, but...

10:08.242 --> 10:11.368
You know, you could be
a bit more enthusiastic.

10:11.370 --> 10:14.114
Your father is the
leading mind in his field.

10:14.116 --> 10:15.886
You can ask me anything!

10:15.888 --> 10:17.035
Um.

10:17.037 --> 10:18.042
Well, come on.

10:18.044 --> 10:21.379
Um, why can't you
just have a normal job?

10:21.381 --> 10:23.675
Like everyone else's Dad?

10:23.677 --> 10:26.070
Oh my gosh!

10:26.768 --> 10:27.809
Huh?

10:27.811 --> 10:29.514
Don't move, they're here!

10:31.357 --> 10:33.372
Happy birthday to me.

10:35.737 --> 10:39.557
- He's coming.
- Let's get outta here!

11:07.436 --> 11:10.145
Huh, oh!

11:10.147 --> 11:11.048
Attention citizens!

11:11.051 --> 11:12.265
Aliens have landed on Earth!

11:12.267 --> 11:14.318
Oh, please, not again!

11:16.437 --> 11:18.382
The moment of my
vindication has arrived!

11:18.384 --> 11:20.468
Hide your houses and lock your
children...

11:21.373 --> 11:22.866
Hide your children and lock your
houses!

11:22.868 --> 11:25.161
Will you stop shouting, you
loony-bin!

11:25.163 --> 11:27.072
You'll give my wife a migraine

11:27.075 --> 11:29.573
and believe me, that never ends
well.

11:29.576 --> 11:31.138
But this time it's for real!

11:31.140 --> 11:32.809
I saw them right in my own yard!

11:35.867 --> 11:36.908
There, you see!

11:36.910 --> 11:39.168
Ha, who's the loony-bin now?

11:39.170 --> 11:41.322
Lucky for you all, I have
long prepared for this day!

11:41.325 --> 11:43.546
What do you think you're
doing!

11:43.548 --> 11:46.190
Here are your aliens!

11:47.095 --> 11:50.498
Oh, you two are
double-decker-ultra-grounded!

11:51.891 --> 11:55.609
Oh, it's the Henderson kids,
again.

11:58.808 --> 12:01.102
It's okay, you'll be good as
new.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.765
And a nut-bucket like that
is raising a kid by himself!

12:06.767 --> 12:09.964
Poor boy, a dead mother
and a crack-pot for a father.

12:09.966 --> 12:11.773
I'm calling Child Services.

12:12.746 --> 12:13.995
It's ridiculous.

12:13.997 --> 12:15.942
That's an excellent
idea, you should do that.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.019
Oh boy.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.243
We thank
you all again for choosing

12:32.245 --> 12:34.293
Cosmic Caravan Cruiselines.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.728
We put the you in Universe.

12:36.730 --> 12:38.188
On the left side of the vessel

12:38.190 --> 12:42.567
you can now see Planet P.U.
1753-L,

12:42.569 --> 12:44.860
known locally as Ee-yarth.

12:44.862 --> 12:46.876
One of the few inhabited planets

12:46.878 --> 12:49.136
in this backward part of the
galaxy.

12:49.138 --> 12:53.307
It is comprised of one-third
land, one-third water,

12:53.309 --> 12:56.088
and one-third high-fructose corn
syrup.

12:57.306 --> 12:59.981
Ancient Fleegyarblians used this
planet

12:59.983 --> 13:01.858
as a toxic waste dump,

13:01.860 --> 13:04.919
from which, primitive
life-forms have evolved.

13:06.657 --> 13:09.054
Ew, they look so bizarre...

13:09.958 --> 13:11.902
You know, you are so right,
beautiful.

13:11.904 --> 13:13.050
They don't hold a candle to you

13:13.052 --> 13:15.172
or each of your many sparkling
eyes.

13:16.145 --> 13:17.430
So here you are.

13:17.432 --> 13:21.286
Oh, hey honey, it's not how it
looks.

13:21.288 --> 13:22.643
She means nothing to me.

13:22.645 --> 13:23.929
What?

13:23.931 --> 13:25.632
- You little
- Oh!

13:25.634 --> 13:26.744
- Rotten,
- Oh!

13:26.746 --> 13:27.752
- Despicable,
- Ow!

13:27.754 --> 13:29.838
Flargnarg!

13:30.779 --> 13:31.645
Dinner?

13:31.647 --> 13:33.730
I could eat.

13:33.732 --> 13:36.893
Ah in my defense, it
says all that word for word

13:36.895 --> 13:37.936
in my Spacedate profile!

13:37.938 --> 13:40.683
Oh Wabo, why don't you
give the ladies a rest

13:40.685 --> 13:42.386
and focus on your gluttony.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.436
It's by far your greatest vice.

13:44.438 --> 13:46.312
Hey Nag, Wabo, check it out!

13:46.314 --> 13:48.677
We can pick up Television
signals from this planet.

13:48.679 --> 13:50.936
Oh, anything good on?

13:50.938 --> 13:51.842
Breaking news.

13:53.684 --> 13:55.593
Mog, what are you doing?

13:55.595 --> 13:57.958
You're not supposed to play
around with the monitors!

13:57.960 --> 13:58.965
Yeah, give me that!

13:58.967 --> 14:00.807
Mine, give me!

14:00.809 --> 14:04.005
Stop it, you two or you're
gonna break something!

14:04.007 --> 14:04.978
I'll do it!

14:05.676 --> 14:07.134
♪ Baby, baby ♪

14:08.353 --> 14:09.497
Yummy!

14:09.500 --> 14:10.922
This astonishing product.

14:10.925 --> 14:11.826
Oh, that's cool.

14:11.828 --> 14:12.938
The NubbiDubbi!

14:12.940 --> 14:14.292
Ah.

14:14.294 --> 14:16.483
The NubbiDubbi is a high quality,
interactive massage mat,

14:16.485 --> 14:19.646
that will work out any knots
or kinks that you might have.

14:19.648 --> 14:22.219
Oh Bill, that sounds
fabulous!

14:22.221 --> 14:23.991
Take a look dear viewers.

14:23.993 --> 14:25.346
Every one of these nubs is made
of a

14:25.348 --> 14:28.196
hyper flexible fiber re-enforced
polymer.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.038
That really will help you get to
those

14:30.040 --> 14:34.454
hard to reach spots and
send you to cloud nine.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.546
Absolutely Bill, and even
more.

14:37.548 --> 14:39.737
This product can give your empty
life

14:39.739 --> 14:42.657
the meaning you so desperately
crave.

14:42.659 --> 14:44.012
Whoa.

14:44.014 --> 14:45.715
Turn it on Jill.

14:45.717 --> 14:46.828
Sure Bill.

14:46.830 --> 14:48.079
Wow!

14:48.081 --> 14:49.436
I feel so alive!

14:51.521 --> 14:55.064
I love this NubbiDubbi!

14:55.066 --> 14:59.410
Uh-huh, I love this
NubbiDubbi.

14:59.412 --> 15:01.634
And you will too viewers!

15:01.636 --> 15:05.491
And a special feature, you
can adjust the intensity!

15:05.493 --> 15:07.928
It goes all the way up to
eleven.

15:09.875 --> 15:11.229
Up to eleven!

15:11.231 --> 15:12.447
- Wow.
- Whoa, oh.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.511
Friends, if you don't
order this item today,

15:16.513 --> 15:19.779
I'm 100% confident the rest of
your life

15:19.781 --> 15:22.664
will be consumed by pain and
regret.

15:22.666 --> 15:24.227
Am I right, Bill?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.355
So don't hesitate to contact me.

15:27.357 --> 15:29.406
I am waiting for you!

15:29.408 --> 15:30.483
For us?

15:30.485 --> 15:31.700
Did you hear that?

15:31.702 --> 15:33.994
She is waiting for us!

15:33.996 --> 15:38.026
There are only 279 of these
one-of-a-kind items left,

15:38.028 --> 15:39.068
so you can't afford to hesitate.

15:39.070 --> 15:42.232
Only 279 left!

15:42.234 --> 15:44.561
Hey, what are you guys doing?

15:44.563 --> 15:46.647
Mog, Wabo, wait!

15:46.650 --> 15:48.559
I am not going anyway with you!

15:48.561 --> 15:50.610
Okay, see ya!

15:58.362 --> 16:00.897
Hey, where are we going?

16:00.900 --> 16:02.497
We're not supposed to be in
here.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.198
We're going down to that
planet

16:04.201 --> 16:07.744
to get some NubbiDubbi
before they run out!

16:07.746 --> 16:08.787
What?

16:08.789 --> 16:11.185
We don't know anything
about the eeyarthlings!

16:11.187 --> 16:12.820
They could be dangerous!

16:12.822 --> 16:13.689
Oh come on!

16:13.691 --> 16:15.287
You heard what Jill said,

16:15.289 --> 16:16.608
"If we don't order this item,

16:16.610 --> 16:19.701
I'm 100% sure that you will
regret it."

16:19.703 --> 16:20.883
That's what she said!

16:20.885 --> 16:23.977
But the captain has expressly
forbidden anybody to...

16:23.979 --> 16:26.410
Nag, don't be such a
splignorp!

16:26.412 --> 16:28.635
We'll be back before they
even know we're gone.

16:28.637 --> 16:31.275
Now come on, we don't
wanna keep Jill waiting.

16:31.277 --> 16:32.701
I will not come along with
you!

16:32.703 --> 16:34.439
No way!

16:44.104 --> 16:45.144
Hi Jennifer!

16:45.146 --> 16:46.327
Would you like some cake?

16:46.329 --> 16:49.318
I made it myself, with extra
raisins!

16:51.994 --> 16:53.522
We made a raft, as well.

16:55.505 --> 16:56.580
Hey, Jenny!

16:56.582 --> 16:58.355
Brought ya a slice of my cake.

17:00.162 --> 17:01.344
Don't mind if I do!

17:02.838 --> 17:05.406
Mmh, hey, this is some legit
cake, yo.

17:05.409 --> 17:06.450
Did you make this?

17:06.452 --> 17:09.301
Uh, I mean, gross, dweeb!

17:09.304 --> 17:10.309
Hey, give that back!

17:10.310 --> 17:13.785
And what you gonna do about
it, Louise?

17:13.787 --> 17:16.877
Sic your loony old man on me
with his cray-cray-gun, yo?

17:21.712 --> 17:22.718
You jerk!

17:25.186 --> 17:26.785
Hey, whoa, cool it dude.

17:26.787 --> 17:28.314
Let go.

17:28.316 --> 17:29.045
- I am an ice man.
- Got ya.

17:29.047 --> 17:31.200
I am selling ice-creams.

17:35.789 --> 17:37.875
What a loser.

17:38.952 --> 17:42.253
Here, latest webcast is
up on the school news site.

17:42.255 --> 17:43.920
Big whoop.

17:43.922 --> 17:46.527
Wow, have you got any stories
in it?

17:46.529 --> 17:50.698
No, they ran a piece last
time, after the credits,

17:50.701 --> 17:51.915
like bloopers.

17:51.917 --> 17:55.390
Well, maybe you'll have a
big story in the next one.

17:55.392 --> 17:57.544
They only let me do those
stupid surveys

17:57.546 --> 18:00.048
because certain editors
at the school news network

18:00.051 --> 18:02.759
are incapable of
recognizing an epic talent

18:02.761 --> 18:04.498
when they see it.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.444
That's so unfair.

18:06.446 --> 18:10.336
Yea well, uh, Luis, do you
need a hand?

18:10.338 --> 18:13.673
Huh, no, no, I'm cool.

18:13.676 --> 18:17.532
Okay, come on Patty,

18:17.534 --> 18:19.933
these flyers aren't gonna
hand themselves out.

18:20.835 --> 18:25.596
Smooth Luis, real
smooth.

18:28.761 --> 18:29.804
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.405
This is Luis.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.297
Oh, I feel I've come
not a moment too soon!

18:40.300 --> 18:41.133
What?

18:41.135 --> 18:42.940
Ms. Diekendaker is
Headmistress

18:42.942 --> 18:45.409
of the Sunny Days Home
for Neglected Children.

18:47.216 --> 18:49.301
I'm worried about you, young Mr.
Sonntag.

18:49.303 --> 18:50.517
One of your neighbors has
reported

18:50.519 --> 18:52.916
the sub-standard conditions
you're forced to live in,

18:52.918 --> 18:55.628
and the questionable
fitness of your guardian!

18:55.630 --> 18:57.191
Since the passing of your poor
mother

18:57.193 --> 18:59.415
things seem to unraveling fast.

18:59.417 --> 19:03.238
What, no, I, my dad...

19:03.240 --> 19:06.332
Don't you think you'd be
much better off at Sunny-Days?

19:06.334 --> 19:07.409
You'll have so much fun living
with

19:07.411 --> 19:09.913
all those other problem
children.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.233
Wouldn't that be nice?

19:11.235 --> 19:13.075
No, I don't want to go away!

19:13.077 --> 19:14.362
Ew.

19:14.364 --> 19:17.212
Dear boy, it's not about what
you want, but what you need.

19:17.214 --> 19:18.533
But.

19:18.535 --> 19:22.078
Oh, my, you're not going
to cry, are you, Luis?

19:22.080 --> 19:24.479
There now, let me dry those
tears.

19:26.215 --> 19:27.987
Huh, uh, uh?

19:32.161 --> 19:34.175
Well, well, well.

19:34.177 --> 19:37.927
These are definitely the
tears of a lonely boy.

19:37.929 --> 19:39.213
What?

19:39.215 --> 19:41.090
You and your father will be in
my office

19:41.092 --> 19:42.967
this afternoon at three p.m. on
the dot.

19:42.969 --> 19:44.913
Do you understand?

19:44.915 --> 19:46.269
But...

19:46.271 --> 19:49.084
Please be punctual, garbage-free,
and wearing both shoes.

19:59.133 --> 20:01.771
- Dad, Dad, Dad.
- Luis, please!

20:01.773 --> 20:03.753
I need my sleep.

20:03.755 --> 20:04.726
No, wait!

20:04.728 --> 20:07.055
Dad, you've got to come to
school with me!

20:07.057 --> 20:11.331
I have a PhD son, I went to
school.

20:11.333 --> 20:13.241
Dad, they want to send me away

20:13.243 --> 20:15.501
to a home called Sunny Side.

20:15.503 --> 20:18.039
We gotta stop them, Dad, please!

20:18.041 --> 20:21.097
Not sunny-side up, son,
over-easy.

20:21.100 --> 20:22.594
You know that, Luis.

20:24.680 --> 20:29.754
The Aliens.

20:48.141 --> 20:49.704
Huh?

21:00.759 --> 21:02.321
Huh?

21:04.130 --> 21:05.275
What the?

21:05.277 --> 21:06.282
Whoa!

21:08.579 --> 21:10.177
Are you sure
we're at the right place?

21:10.179 --> 21:13.547
Of course, the autopilot
just followed the signal.

21:13.550 --> 21:14.694
What do you mean?

21:14.696 --> 21:17.336
Well, this is exactly
where the signal came from.

21:17.338 --> 21:18.760
It must be Jill and Bill.

21:18.762 --> 21:20.811
They're expecting us.

21:25.019 --> 21:25.922
Stop it, Wabo!

21:25.925 --> 21:28.806
One doesn't scribble on foreign
planets!

21:28.808 --> 21:29.988
What's he writing?

21:29.990 --> 21:34.160
Mog is a butt-head

21:34.162 --> 21:35.063
What?

21:35.065 --> 21:36.245
Oh come here, you.

21:36.247 --> 21:37.705
I'm gonna year you apart.

21:37.707 --> 21:38.643
I'm gonna slam you.

21:38.645 --> 21:39.338
I'm going to.

21:41.286 --> 21:42.396
Uh oh.

21:42.398 --> 21:44.064
How dare you...

22:01.655 --> 22:03.321
Aw, you made us crash!

22:03.323 --> 22:04.468
No, you made us crash!

22:04.470 --> 22:08.812
And look, the viewing screen
is completely damaged.

22:08.814 --> 22:09.543
You're face is damaged!

22:09.545 --> 22:11.037
Oh, you wanna damaged face?

22:11.039 --> 22:13.436
Then I'll show you a damaged
face.

22:13.438 --> 22:14.339
Oh you want to go?

22:14.341 --> 22:15.660
I'll break it.

22:15.662 --> 22:16.843
The NubbiDubbi is out there
somewhere, come on, let's go!

22:16.845 --> 22:17.781
No, stop!

22:17.783 --> 22:19.866
First we have to test the
atmosphere.

22:19.868 --> 22:21.952
The pressure could make our eyes
pop out,

22:21.954 --> 22:24.419
or the gases they could
make our lungs explode,

22:24.421 --> 22:27.931
or, you never.

22:27.933 --> 22:29.254
Hm, smells nice.

22:30.469 --> 22:32.795
They, they're real?

22:32.797 --> 22:34.290
Dad was right.

22:34.292 --> 22:35.577
He's not nuts.

22:35.579 --> 22:37.038
My dad's not nuts!

22:38.256 --> 22:40.200
A blue sky, how strange.

22:40.202 --> 22:41.764
What am I doing here?

22:41.766 --> 22:42.876
I'm hungry.

22:42.878 --> 22:46.420
Ok, so all we gotta do
is find a viewing system.

22:50.559 --> 22:55.493
Hands up, ee-yarthling, or
we will uh, obliterate you!

22:55.495 --> 22:57.022
No, please!

22:57.025 --> 22:58.100
What's obliterate?

22:58.102 --> 22:59.420
Make him explode!

22:59.422 --> 23:00.915
We don't know how to do that.

23:00.917 --> 23:02.027
He doesn't know that!

23:02.029 --> 23:04.287
Don't worry, we won't hurt
you!

23:04.289 --> 23:05.921
We're just looking for Jill!

23:05.923 --> 23:07.415
Do you know, where she is?

23:07.417 --> 23:08.666
Huh?

23:08.668 --> 23:11.620
We looking to get our hands
on one of her NubbiDubbis.

23:11.622 --> 23:12.350
Her what?

23:12.352 --> 23:14.228
A NubbiDubbi massage mat.

23:14.230 --> 23:16.350
It's got thousands of polymer
nubs

23:16.352 --> 23:18.642
that can send us to cloud 9.

23:18.644 --> 23:22.013
It goes all the way up to 11!

23:22.015 --> 23:24.655
You're not how I imagined
aliens.

23:24.657 --> 23:26.150
Aliens?

23:26.152 --> 23:29.487
We're not aliens, you're the
aliens.

23:29.489 --> 23:30.808
Yeah, we're Whoopies!

23:30.810 --> 23:33.275
We're the most attractive
people in the galaxy.

23:33.277 --> 23:34.317
Come on, fellas!

23:34.319 --> 23:36.890
Our multi-nubbed destiny awaits!

23:36.892 --> 23:39.186
Wait, you can't leave
your spaceship here!

23:40.925 --> 23:41.965
He's right.

23:41.967 --> 23:44.226
This space is clearly
reserved for creatures

23:44.228 --> 23:46.518
with large wheels for backsides.

23:46.520 --> 23:49.440
Um, let's hide it in
the barn over there.

23:54.340 --> 23:57.570
Thanks, Ee-yarth-boy, we owe
you one.

23:57.572 --> 24:00.560
It's actually pronounced
Earth.

24:00.562 --> 24:02.437
Ruff?

24:02.439 --> 24:03.272
Earth.

24:06.889 --> 24:08.381
Ah, forget it.

24:08.383 --> 24:12.100
So, you flew through the
whole universe in that?

24:12.102 --> 24:14.603
No, this is only a landing
craft.

24:14.605 --> 24:18.147
The cruise ship is much
bigger, like a small town.

24:18.150 --> 24:19.190
Cruise ship?

24:19.192 --> 24:20.826
Cosmic Caravan Cruises, baby!

24:20.828 --> 24:22.632
We put the you in
universe!

24:22.634 --> 24:25.586
Wow and all this is
happening on my birthday!

24:25.588 --> 24:26.872
Birthday?

24:26.875 --> 24:29.271
You mean the anniversary of the
beginning of your existence?

24:30.142 --> 24:31.009
You heard that guys?

24:31.011 --> 24:33.512
It's the yurth boy's detachment
day!

24:33.514 --> 24:35.597
Detachment day?

24:35.600 --> 24:39.107
Yeah, we Whoopies kind
of grow on our moms.

24:39.109 --> 24:40.567
Like a fungus, pretty much.

24:40.569 --> 24:42.897
And when we're ready,
the doctor scrapes us off.

24:42.900 --> 24:43.940
Uh.

24:43.942 --> 24:44.809
And that's our,

Oh, Luis!

25:19.081 --> 25:20.192
Thanks guys.

25:20.194 --> 25:23.182
That was really interesting.

25:23.184 --> 25:25.926
Let's go, we have a
mission to accomplish.

25:25.928 --> 25:27.212
Alright, let's go!

25:27.214 --> 25:30.411
Go where?

25:30.413 --> 25:32.113
Hey, where are you going?

25:47.965 --> 25:49.251
Okay.

25:49.253 --> 25:52.342
Come, come snookums,
off to the school play.

25:52.344 --> 25:53.593
It's getting
late dear.

25:53.595 --> 25:56.725
Oh, those e-arthlings
are leaving their nest.

25:57.803 --> 26:01.104
Looks like
they'll be gone for a while.

26:01.106 --> 26:04.542
Luis, does this nest have
a signal-viewing apparatus?

26:04.544 --> 26:08.402
Uh yeah, every house has one
or 10.

26:08.404 --> 26:09.272
Perfect!

26:10.141 --> 26:11.946
Wait, no, but.

26:34.055 --> 26:38.433
Dad, Dad, Dad, Dad, wake up!

26:38.435 --> 26:39.650
Wake up, Dad!

26:46.289 --> 26:47.923
What, uh, what, whoa, what
the?

26:49.417 --> 26:52.891
What would you do if
aliens really have landed?

26:52.893 --> 26:54.837
What, what are you talking
about?

26:54.839 --> 26:56.368
And what if they were friendly

26:56.370 --> 26:58.836
and didn't want to hurt anybody?

26:58.838 --> 27:01.964
This is what you woke me up
for?

27:01.966 --> 27:05.300
Why, I'd shoot them with
my Shockfroster, of course!

27:05.302 --> 27:06.238
Why?

27:06.240 --> 27:07.351
They're really nice.

27:07.353 --> 27:10.479
I mean, if they were real,
I mean, they wouldn't...

27:10.481 --> 27:13.294
Believe me, son, when
aliens land here, again

27:13.296 --> 27:14.825
they definitely won't be nice!

27:14.827 --> 27:18.160
They will plunder our
resources and enslave us all.

27:18.162 --> 27:20.769
Something like that needs
to be nipped in the bud!

27:22.195 --> 27:24.453
Why are you asking me this?

27:24.455 --> 27:27.059
Um well, no reason, you know.

27:27.061 --> 27:29.494
You told me to be more
enthusiastic.

27:30.432 --> 27:34.219
Well, well that's great, but
not in the middle of the day!

27:34.221 --> 27:38.286
You know I need my sleep so
I can do my work at night.

27:40.166 --> 27:41.035
Huh?

27:44.648 --> 27:46.106
Such a strange boy.

27:46.108 --> 27:47.915
No idea where he gets that from.

27:49.377 --> 27:52.401
Come on!

27:58.517 --> 27:59.421
Okay.

28:09.084 --> 28:11.864
Don't wake me again!
Under any circumstances!

28:22.257 --> 28:23.056
Huh?

28:25.420 --> 28:26.391
Hello?

28:26.393 --> 28:28.025
Hello, Mr.
Sonntag?

28:28.027 --> 28:29.415
We had an appointment for three
p.m!

28:29.417 --> 28:31.813
Did Luis not inform you?

28:31.815 --> 28:35.671
Uh um, of course, yea, my son
told me.

28:35.673 --> 28:38.558
But I, I can assure you
that there is absolutely

28:38.560 --> 28:41.893
no need to send Luis away to
that creepy lady's school.

28:41.895 --> 28:44.640
Luis, is that you?

28:44.642 --> 28:47.107
Do you take me for some kind of
fool, boy?

28:47.109 --> 28:48.150
Very well.

28:48.152 --> 28:49.645
Well I'll just have to
come and see for myself!

28:49.647 --> 28:51.765
I'll be there in 20 minutes!

28:51.767 --> 28:54.059
And if I find even the
smallest sign of neglect,

28:54.061 --> 28:55.484
your fathers custody of you

28:55.486 --> 28:57.881
will be removed on the
spot, you understand!

28:57.883 --> 28:59.654
No, no, no, wait.

29:09.007 --> 29:09.702
Oh.

29:12.517 --> 29:16.965
- Two large melons!
- Huh, hey.

29:16.967 --> 29:18.598
Look at this, it's fun huh?

29:18.601 --> 29:19.573
Look at me!

29:20.582 --> 29:22.041
Look, help me.

29:24.092 --> 29:26.418
Cut it out, Wabo, I have to
concentrate!

29:26.420 --> 29:27.496
Argh matey.

29:27.498 --> 29:30.172

cloudy.

29:30.175 --> 29:32.362
Ah, no.

29:40.497 --> 29:42.097
Ah, Wabo, please.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.992
Oh, what's that??

29:50.994 --> 29:52.105
This?

29:52.107 --> 29:53.843
Everybody knows what this is.

29:53.845 --> 29:56.276
It's a, one of those,

29:56.278 --> 29:59.786
a face sucker!

30:03.021 --> 30:04.861
Hey, what does this button do?

30:04.863 --> 30:06.842
Whoa!

30:06.844 --> 30:08.929
Oh oh oh, I found it!

Don't worry, yurth boy, we'll

Obliterate him?!

Hide!

32:29.283 --> 32:31.054

Oh, okay!

33:12.454 --> 33:16.866
Oh, maybe not.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.079
Mr. and Mrs. Winter!

33:27.261 --> 33:29.448
I thought you were at
your daughter's play.

33:29.451 --> 33:33.551
Um, we were, but I had a
sudden desire to take a shower!

33:35.289 --> 33:37.131
Who showers in their clothes?

33:38.488 --> 33:40.293
I don't know.

33:40.295 --> 33:41.683
We give up.

33:41.685 --> 33:43.386
Who showers in their clothes?

33:43.388 --> 33:44.325
Is there somebody in there?

33:44.327 --> 33:46.132
- Yes.
- No.

33:46.134 --> 33:49.052
Um, just me, visiting.

33:49.054 --> 33:50.303
Hi.

33:50.305 --> 33:53.467
I, I'd better get to work!

34:09.664 --> 34:11.367
Oh, it's you, Allegro!

34:12.237 --> 34:14.321
I didn't see you there.

34:15.920 --> 34:17.382
Who's a good perro?

34:20.788 --> 34:22.454
You like that, don't you?

34:22.456 --> 34:23.322
Oh, oh, oh yeah sure.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.452
That's good, lower to the left
please.

34:26.454 --> 34:28.538
What is going on here?

34:28.540 --> 34:31.213
Well it looks to me like
someone has a crush on you.

34:31.215 --> 34:33.021
Oh come on, chill, babe.

34:33.023 --> 34:35.107
Give me some more of
that sweet loving huh,

34:35.109 --> 34:36.114
don't play hard to get!

34:36.116 --> 34:38.304
Not one step more!

34:44.250 --> 34:46.264
Was it something I said?

34:46.266 --> 34:48.592
You think I could get her
number when she wakes up?

34:48.594 --> 34:51.130
You always have to
cause trouble, don't you?

34:51.132 --> 34:53.284
Hey, is it my fault
that the ladies love me?

34:59.890 --> 35:02.669
Hey dude, the 'rents are gone!

35:02.671 --> 35:03.851
Told them I was sick yo

35:03.853 --> 35:06.806
and couldn't go to my dumb
sister's dumb school play.

35:06.808 --> 35:08.995
Get over here, time to party!

35:08.997 --> 35:12.506
Yeah, we can cruise with
my old lady's car again.

35:12.508 --> 35:13.482
She'll never know!

35:14.385 --> 35:15.254
Whoa.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.311
Time out dude.

35:18.313 --> 35:20.988
The cleaning lady is dead or
something.

35:23.040 --> 35:23.979
Valentina?

35:27.662 --> 35:29.260
Huh?

35:29.262 --> 35:31.729
Uh, call you back!

35:35.519 --> 35:36.700
Hey!

35:37.743 --> 35:39.827
What are you doing in
my house, nerd boy, huh?

35:39.829 --> 35:41.494
Um, I, uh.

35:41.496 --> 35:42.919
Come on, talk!

35:42.921 --> 35:44.448
I can explain everything!

35:44.451 --> 35:46.883
Well, almost everything.

35:46.885 --> 35:49.418
Okay to be honest, I
can't explain a whole lot.

35:49.420 --> 35:52.305
Start with what you did to
Valentina?

35:52.307 --> 35:53.522
Who?

35:54.218 --> 35:55.088
Huh?

35:56.408 --> 36:01.622
Mom, Dad, why
are you back so early?

36:02.072 --> 36:03.287
Never mind that!

36:03.289 --> 36:05.582
What's this about time to party

36:05.584 --> 36:07.563
and you driving your old lady's
car?

36:07.565 --> 36:09.336
And who is this Old lady?

36:09.338 --> 36:10.587
I think he means you.

36:10.589 --> 36:12.117
Me, old?

36:12.119 --> 36:14.548
I'm not a day over 124!

36:14.551 --> 36:17.712
125, don't make yourself
younger than you are!

36:17.714 --> 36:19.937
What is going on?

36:19.939 --> 36:21.259
You are a rude boy!

36:21.261 --> 36:25.012
That's what's going on!

36:25.014 --> 36:27.654
Whoa, she, she's drunk, yo!

36:27.656 --> 36:28.766
Never mind her.

36:28.768 --> 36:31.825
Your mother and I are
very disappointed in you!

36:31.827 --> 36:33.423
You're his mother.

36:33.426 --> 36:35.857
Oh, right, yes, I'm your
mother!

36:35.859 --> 36:37.525
I'm very disappointed in you.

36:37.527 --> 36:41.731
Whoa dude, something
is very, very wrong here.

36:47.394 --> 36:50.032
Go to your room, wherever that
is!

36:52.135 --> 36:55.298
Cool, I've always wanted
to see that look on his face.

36:55.300 --> 36:56.203
Uh.

36:57.420 --> 36:58.356
Woohoo!

36:58.358 --> 37:00.510
That was fun, what do we do now?

37:00.513 --> 37:01.347
Nothing!

37:03.433 --> 37:05.098
As soon as our NubbiDubbi is
delivered,

37:05.100 --> 37:06.698
we go back to the ship.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.792
Okay, but until then, I
wanna play more human game!

37:09.794 --> 37:10.904
Yeah.

37:10.906 --> 37:12.641
Go to your room!

37:12.643 --> 37:13.789
He totally bought it!

37:13.791 --> 37:15.668
He really thought I was his
father!

37:17.231 --> 37:19.905
Yeah, he did.

37:19.907 --> 37:21.227
Oh, no.

37:21.229 --> 37:23.000
It's almost 3 thirty.

37:23.002 --> 37:24.147
I have an idea!

37:24.149 --> 37:26.509
Wait here, I'll be right back!

37:38.087 --> 37:39.127
What are you doing?

37:39.129 --> 37:40.934
What did I just say?

37:40.937 --> 37:42.185
Is this where you live?

37:42.188 --> 37:43.820
Shh!

37:43.822 --> 37:45.107
Shh!

37:46.255 --> 37:47.052
Who's this?

37:47.054 --> 37:47.955
That's my dad.

37:47.957 --> 37:52.266
Oh, and he is a male, yes?

37:52.268 --> 37:53.726
Yes.

37:53.728 --> 37:55.428
I'm getting good at this.

37:55.430 --> 37:57.723
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

37:57.725 --> 38:00.713
Stop, if he wakes up he's
gonna zap you with that!

38:00.715 --> 38:02.068
With this?

38:02.070 --> 38:04.814
Whoa.

38:08.222 --> 38:09.679
Oops.

38:09.681 --> 38:10.410
Stop it!

38:10.413 --> 38:11.696
We have to leave!

38:11.698 --> 38:14.024
The principal could arrive any
second.

38:14.026 --> 38:15.310
What, here?

38:15.313 --> 38:18.717
Yes and when he sees this
mess, he's gonna take me away.

38:18.719 --> 38:21.080
But I'm not going, no way!

38:21.082 --> 38:21.916
Good grief!

38:21.918 --> 38:23.933
There must be a way to stop him!

38:24.976 --> 38:26.295
There is.

39:04.912 --> 39:06.335
Hey, what are you doing?

39:06.338 --> 39:07.760
I'm the cleaning lady.

39:07.763 --> 39:09.638
No, I'm the cleaning lady!

39:09.640 --> 39:11.584
No, I'm the cleaning
lady!

39:11.587 --> 39:12.905
No, I am!

39:12.907 --> 39:15.303
No, I am the cleaning lady.

39:15.305 --> 39:17.981
Come on guys, you're
both the cleaning lady.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.559
Yay, woohoo!

39:21.562 --> 39:24.306
Uh, Luis, is that your
principal?

39:24.308 --> 39:27.573
Oh, no, he brought that creepy
lady!

39:27.575 --> 39:30.077
Looks like the show's about to
begin.

39:30.980 --> 39:32.093
- Mmh.
- Mmh.

39:36.439 --> 39:40.052
Oh, hello, Mr. Principal, what
an honor!

39:40.054 --> 39:45.299
I'm Armin Sonntag, do
please come in.

39:45.301 --> 39:48.220
- How nice of you to come by.
- Mmh.

39:48.222 --> 39:50.375
And who is this impressive
specimen

39:50.377 --> 39:51.799
of humanness you have with you?

39:51.801 --> 39:53.538
Well, this is Miss...

39:53.540 --> 39:55.414
I am here to assess your
capabilities

39:55.416 --> 39:56.596
as a guardian for Luis

39:56.598 --> 39:59.585
and to see if he has an
acceptable living environment.

39:59.588 --> 40:02.019
Uh, yes, Luis's living
environment

40:02.021 --> 40:03.756
is more than acceptable!

40:03.758 --> 40:08.170
It's downright passable,
don't you agree?

40:09.945 --> 40:10.918
Huh, hmm.

40:12.170 --> 40:13.905
Luis, where are your manners?

40:13.907 --> 40:15.575
Come here and say hi to our
guests!

40:15.577 --> 40:20.928
Oh, uh, uh, good afternoon
and good afternoon to you too.

40:22.457 --> 40:23.324
Is it?

40:23.326 --> 40:24.856
We'll see!

40:26.280 --> 40:28.052
Mr. Sonntag, we've had reports

40:28.054 --> 40:31.217
that you spend all day asleep on
the sofa.

40:31.219 --> 40:33.127
Ah, yes, well...

40:33.129 --> 40:34.204
Not anymore!

40:34.206 --> 40:36.604
My dad is like a completely
different person!

40:37.474 --> 40:38.377
Hm.

40:40.915 --> 40:43.381
Well, the house certainly is
clean.

40:43.383 --> 40:45.708
Oh yes, thanks to my fabulous
staff.

40:47.588 --> 40:50.193
Twins, hatched three minutes
apart.

40:50.195 --> 40:52.071
Strange, your neighbor called

40:52.073 --> 40:53.878
and said this place was a pig
sty.

40:53.880 --> 40:54.712
Really?

40:54.714 --> 40:56.068
Well, I'm not one to say

40:56.070 --> 40:57.979
anything bad about my neighbor's
house,

40:57.981 --> 41:01.770
but I mean,
did you see their house?

41:02.777 --> 41:04.517
My, quite the dump.

41:07.715 --> 41:09.692
Isn't it true that you spend
all night

41:09.694 --> 41:13.829
looking through your telescope,
searching for aliens?

41:13.831 --> 41:16.819
Ha ha, oh no, no, no, no, no,

41:16.821 --> 41:18.869
I'm no longer interested in
aliens!

41:18.871 --> 41:21.198
Crazy beings who rush
all over the solar system

41:21.200 --> 41:22.865
babbling nonsense and making.

41:24.154 --> 41:26.446
That's if they existed at all,
of course.

41:28.916 --> 41:29.958
Of course.

41:34.129 --> 41:35.692
Hey beautiful.

41:42.610 --> 41:43.477
How dare you!

41:43.479 --> 41:45.251
Stop that at once!

41:49.005 --> 41:50.706
Hm?

41:50.708 --> 41:53.037
Oh, does someone else live
here?

41:53.039 --> 41:55.573
Oh, no that's my, uh.

41:55.575 --> 41:56.722
Alarm clock.

41:56.724 --> 41:58.633
At three-thirty in the
afternoon?

41:58.635 --> 42:01.274
Just a reminder to
help Luis do his thing.

42:01.276 --> 42:02.003
Homework!

42:02.005 --> 42:03.706
It's so important these days.

42:03.708 --> 42:06.382
Valentina, would you please
be a dear and turn that off?

42:06.384 --> 42:08.538
- Certainly, Mr. Sonntag.
- Certainly, Mr. Sonntag.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.207
Hey, my name's Valentina!

42:10.209 --> 42:12.048
- No, my name's Valentina!
- We can't both be

42:12.050 --> 42:13.299
called Valentina!

42:20.463 --> 42:21.331
Uh.

42:25.502 --> 42:29.708
Make a sound and I'll wring
you like a nuclear mop, sh.

42:31.064 --> 42:32.765
Sh.

42:39.752 --> 42:40.691
No, the aliens.

42:41.769 --> 42:43.991
Got to get away, got to get
away.

43:00.607 --> 43:04.292
Mom, Dad, I saw an alien over
there, look!

43:09.089 --> 43:10.547
Oh man.

43:16.492 --> 43:17.326
What?

43:25.079 --> 43:26.052
What the?

43:27.442 --> 43:29.247
They're back!

43:29.249 --> 43:32.966
Well then, the next thing
we need to see is Luis's room.

43:33.699 --> 43:34.740
Come on, Luis.

43:34.742 --> 43:36.790
Uh, right, my bedroom.

43:36.792 --> 43:39.120
I'd be happy to show you my
bedroom.

43:41.588 --> 43:42.630
Oh, drat.

43:48.157 --> 43:50.312
Ah well, this is the bathroom
of course.

43:51.701 --> 43:53.093
Just down here, um!

43:55.282 --> 43:57.159
Okay that's the closet.

43:58.064 --> 43:59.766
Your room, please!

43:59.768 --> 44:02.199
Yes, yes, my room.

44:03.451 --> 44:08.419
Here it is!

44:08.421 --> 44:09.533
Um, ah, um.

44:11.967 --> 44:14.088
And this is your room, Luis?

44:15.095 --> 44:16.795
My son loves this room!

44:16.797 --> 44:19.542
He can't get enough cute
little frilly things.

44:22.950 --> 44:25.765
And who likes to wear these?

44:25.767 --> 44:27.363
Uh, uh.

44:27.365 --> 44:31.742
Young man, tell me right
now what is going on!

44:31.744 --> 44:36.958
I, I, uh, okay, this isn't my
room.

44:37.167 --> 44:38.207
Aha!

44:38.209 --> 44:40.293
And that's not my father.

44:40.295 --> 44:41.475
Aha!

44:41.477 --> 44:45.089
What I mean is, he's not just
my father.

44:45.091 --> 44:46.549
He's also my best friend.

44:46.551 --> 44:47.835
Ugh.

44:47.838 --> 44:49.539
He's is building a brand
new room for me in the attic,

44:49.541 --> 44:51.903
an amazing room, just the way I
want!

44:51.905 --> 44:54.787
Until it's done, I live
here with my little sister.

44:54.789 --> 44:56.003
Hm.

44:56.005 --> 44:59.062
My dad may be unusual, but
he's always there for me.

44:59.064 --> 45:00.626
On the weekends we have loads of

45:00.628 --> 45:03.129
really cool adventures together

45:03.131 --> 45:06.465
and if I ever feel sad he
whips up my favorite dinner,

45:06.467 --> 45:10.532
spaghetti carbonara, just
like Mom used to make."

45:10.534 --> 45:14.463
He's the best dad in the whole
world.

45:16.582 --> 45:17.659
It's true, I am!

45:19.989 --> 45:23.949
Well, now, it's obvious
that Luis is not neglected.

45:23.951 --> 45:25.547
This case is closed.

45:25.549 --> 45:27.080
Come along, Ms. Diekendaker!

45:28.331 --> 45:29.200
Mm.

45:33.508 --> 45:37.609
Mr. Sonntag, I noticed
that you're a urologist.

45:37.612 --> 45:41.224
I'm having a little trouble
with my, uh, waterworks.

45:41.226 --> 45:42.475
Drop by anytime!

45:42.477 --> 45:44.629
I'll be happy to check you over
thoroughly

45:44.631 --> 45:46.575
and that goes for you too!

45:46.577 --> 45:47.481
Hm.

45:49.081 --> 45:52.243
I still say there's
something fishy going on here.

45:52.245 --> 45:53.667
Oh, nonsense.

45:53.669 --> 45:56.482
Everything was above board, huh?

45:56.484 --> 45:57.803
They're finally here!

45:57.805 --> 46:00.587
Aliens have landed and they're
here,

46:01.454 --> 46:02.704
in this neighborhood!

46:02.706 --> 46:03.574
Are you listening?

46:05.348 --> 46:06.389
Oh no!

46:06.391 --> 46:07.223
- Huh?
- Huh?

46:07.225 --> 46:07.920
Huh?

46:10.700 --> 46:12.438
We've been busted!

46:13.550 --> 46:15.008
Quick, let's get out of here!

46:17.027 --> 46:18.312
What about the NubbiDubbi?

46:18.314 --> 46:20.154
Forget about it!

46:24.465 --> 46:25.679
Come on!

46:27.838 --> 46:30.720
- I don't know.
- Hurry!

46:30.722 --> 46:32.979
Luis, what's your take
on the shocking news

46:32.981 --> 46:34.890
that instant hot chocolate packs

46:34.892 --> 46:36.976
have received a five cent price
bump?

46:36.978 --> 46:37.880
I don't know!

46:37.882 --> 46:41.008
Oh Luis, stop saying I don't
know!

46:41.010 --> 46:43.789
How am I supposed to do
a story with no answers?

46:43.791 --> 46:44.452
Oh no.

46:45.459 --> 46:46.569
This way!

46:46.571 --> 46:49.697
We should never
have come to this planet!

46:49.699 --> 46:51.748
What's going on?

46:51.750 --> 46:52.724
- Ow.
- Move!

47:03.255 --> 47:04.471
In here!

47:09.303 --> 47:10.589
Oh no, it's locked!

47:13.718 --> 47:16.252
Hey, what about me!

47:16.254 --> 47:17.679
Huh, oh, Okay.

47:25.396 --> 47:27.792
Luis, you're not gonna
get away with this!

47:29.741 --> 47:30.816
Ah!

47:57.304 --> 47:58.589
Ah, greetings, boy!

47:58.591 --> 48:01.333
Would you or your friends like
an ice cream treat from me,

48:01.335 --> 48:02.725
the ice cream man?

48:02.727 --> 48:03.628
Not today!

48:03.630 --> 48:05.714
Because I am an ice cream man,
you see,

48:05.716 --> 48:07.625
and I am selling ice cream.

48:24.590 --> 48:27.158
Hey guys, I think we lost
them.

48:27.160 --> 48:29.453
Cool.

48:29.455 --> 48:31.121
What are we do now?

48:31.123 --> 48:32.755
I'll tell you what we do,

48:32.757 --> 48:36.963
we get off this crazy rock
and go home where it's safe!

48:36.965 --> 48:40.575
Can um, can I come with you?

48:40.577 --> 48:41.306
What?

48:41.308 --> 48:43.044
Are you serious?

48:43.046 --> 48:44.817
Do you really want to leave your
home?

48:44.819 --> 48:46.068
Why not?

48:46.070 --> 48:47.354
I've got nothing here

48:47.356 --> 48:52.637
and that creepy lady, she's
gonna find me no matter what.

48:52.639 --> 48:55.104
Yeah, let's bring him back
with us.

48:55.106 --> 48:57.539
If we show up back at the
ship with a ee-yarthling,

48:57.541 --> 48:58.998
we'll be in big trouble!

48:59.000 --> 49:01.883
But if I stay they
just gonna cart me off

49:01.885 --> 49:04.142
and throw me in some home for
weird kids.

49:05.292 --> 49:06.332
Oh come on, Nag!

49:06.334 --> 49:08.000
Let's give the kid a chance.

49:08.002 --> 49:09.147
And how are we going to
explain it?

49:09.149 --> 49:12.171
You know what'll happen
when the captain finds him.

49:12.173 --> 49:14.538
He won't hesitate to yell at us.

49:16.622 --> 49:18.809
Let's just take him then

49:18.812 --> 49:20.757
and don't say I didn't warn you.

49:20.759 --> 49:23.572
This calls for a
celebration!

49:47.940 --> 49:50.128
But how do you know
they're even in here?

49:50.130 --> 49:51.378
I sense it!

49:51.380 --> 49:55.168
The smell of loneliness of
that punk kid is unmistakable!

49:55.170 --> 49:56.141
Why don't we call it a day,

49:56.143 --> 49:58.991
come back tomorrow
refreshed and energized?

49:58.993 --> 50:00.972
You can't be serious.

50:00.974 --> 50:05.281
No child has ever dared to
undermine me in such a way.

50:05.283 --> 50:07.053
This is personal!

50:07.751 --> 50:09.071
Huh, hm.

50:14.843 --> 50:17.517
Oh my poor sweet thing.

50:17.519 --> 50:20.091
Come here, let me dry your
tears.

50:27.113 --> 50:28.362
Hm.

50:28.364 --> 50:29.232
Hm, hm.

50:33.890 --> 50:35.070
Quickly, this way!

50:35.072 --> 50:40.564
Oh, provisions
for the journey!

50:43.275 --> 50:44.245
Give me!

50:47.376 --> 50:49.425
What are you guys doing?

50:52.103 --> 50:52.970
Ah!

51:09.100 --> 51:12.399
Luis Sonntag, what's going on
here?

51:12.401 --> 51:13.929
Why is the principal chasing you

51:13.931 --> 51:17.231
and who are those weird
looking people with you?

51:17.233 --> 51:18.692
I don't know what you're
talking about!

51:18.694 --> 51:20.569
You're going nowhere until you
tell us

51:20.571 --> 51:22.235
exactly what's going on!

51:22.238 --> 51:24.878
Please, Jennifer, I've
got no time to explain.

51:24.880 --> 51:25.923
Let me through!

51:27.000 --> 51:29.397
No, answers now.

51:33.257 --> 51:34.126
Luis!

51:36.384 --> 51:38.468
Patty, you getting this?

51:38.470 --> 51:39.445
Ah, ah, ah.

51:45.283 --> 51:46.637
Over there!

51:51.679 --> 51:53.484
Quick guys, let's hide in
here.

51:53.487 --> 51:55.815
Yeah, right there.

51:56.789 --> 51:57.657
Huh, ah.

52:01.342 --> 52:02.210
Ah.

52:10.588 --> 52:11.525
In there.

52:16.948 --> 52:19.031
Oh, welcome.

52:19.033 --> 52:21.291
What can we do for you?

52:21.293 --> 52:22.994
Mmh.

52:31.407 --> 52:32.276
Ha!

52:34.397 --> 52:35.300
Huh?

52:39.853 --> 52:44.508
Goodness gracious, I look
terrible!

52:44.510 --> 52:45.242
Ah, ah.

52:47.744 --> 52:49.480
You're right, you're hideous,

52:49.482 --> 52:52.123
but don't worry, we can
fix you up in a jiffy!

52:57.406 --> 52:58.551
Mmh.

52:58.553 --> 53:02.444
Uh, somebody is in
desperate need of a make-over!

53:02.446 --> 53:03.939
I have no intention of letting
you...

53:03.941 --> 53:08.110
Trust me, this will
be tres chic!

53:14.402 --> 53:15.409
What did you do?

53:15.412 --> 53:16.245
Oops!

53:23.475 --> 53:24.588
Break time!

53:26.498 --> 53:27.367
Huh?

53:29.037 --> 53:30.668
The boy!

53:37.067 --> 53:37.970
Get him.

53:39.324 --> 53:41.410
I want that same do!

53:46.207 --> 53:47.076
Aha!

53:55.870 --> 53:58.614
Ah, careful, don't break
it.

53:58.616 --> 54:01.672
So ready to go home, slowly.

54:08.731 --> 54:11.788
Get your butt out of my face!

54:16.272 --> 54:17.001
Now what?

54:21.487 --> 54:24.787
Mog, you only had one job to
do!

54:24.789 --> 54:26.698
It's not my fault!

54:33.234 --> 54:35.283
It's gotta be the gizmo that
connects to the doo-hickey

54:35.285 --> 54:37.650
to the whosey-whatzit, I can fix
it.

54:38.693 --> 54:41.748
This won't take long.

54:43.523 --> 54:46.823
Oh wow, real aliens?

54:46.825 --> 54:51.377
Patty, keep shooting, this
will be the biggest story ever!

54:51.379 --> 54:52.837
We're going to win the Pulitzer.

54:52.839 --> 54:54.851
Wouldn't that be awesome?

54:54.853 --> 54:57.738
Hey guys, I, found the
problem.

54:57.740 --> 54:59.615
There, good as new!

54:59.617 --> 55:00.867
Fantastic.

55:00.869 --> 55:03.577
Well I hope you know how
to put it back together.

55:03.579 --> 55:06.880
Oh, well.

55:08.792 --> 55:13.866
Of all the laser-brained
idiots in the galaxy,

55:13.868 --> 55:15.291
I end up with you!

55:15.293 --> 55:16.820
And Me!

55:16.822 --> 55:17.932
We're gonna be stuck
here forever

55:17.934 --> 55:20.017
on a planet that smells like
sewage

55:20.019 --> 55:21.199
and it's all your fault!

55:21.201 --> 55:23.806
Hey, stop it, right now!

55:23.808 --> 55:25.755
You guys are friends, remember?

55:26.868 --> 55:27.737
Ish.

55:28.779 --> 55:31.105
Enough, I have an idea.

55:31.107 --> 55:33.642
My dad's got all kinds
of space-gizmos at home.

55:33.644 --> 55:34.650
Maybe there is one that could

55:34.652 --> 55:36.701
signal your mother ship
to come pick us up.

55:36.703 --> 55:39.830
Yeah, great idea, except
for that frostshock gun

55:39.832 --> 55:42.298
and your dad's itchy trigger
finger!

55:42.300 --> 55:44.592
Don't worry, I'll figure
something out.

55:44.594 --> 55:46.607
Well, it's worth a shot.

55:46.609 --> 55:47.618
Follow me!

55:49.842 --> 55:52.865
Oh Patty, this footage is
dynamite.

55:52.867 --> 55:53.944
What'd you got so far?

55:55.508 --> 55:57.975
Oh no, you had it on selfie.

56:00.026 --> 56:01.902
Dad, you home?

56:03.224 --> 56:04.058
Come on.

56:07.847 --> 56:10.277
Ah.

56:10.279 --> 56:11.355
Hm.

56:11.357 --> 56:13.580
What, I'm a nervous eater.

56:13.582 --> 56:16.223
It's okay, nobody reads them
anyway.

56:20.568 --> 56:21.435
Hm, hm, no.

56:22.723 --> 56:24.250
Oh come on, oh.

56:24.252 --> 56:28.388
Oh, oh, oh, I can do something
with this!

56:28.390 --> 56:31.448
I just put, do-da-do, over
there.

56:32.560 --> 56:34.017
There we go.

56:34.019 --> 56:36.206
As long as you don't take it
apart.

56:36.208 --> 56:37.772
Have I ever let you down?

56:37.774 --> 56:38.675
- Yes.
- Yeah.

56:38.677 --> 56:42.153
About five minutes ago, just
focus!

56:44.031 --> 56:47.054
Hm, oh, what is that?

56:48.201 --> 56:52.126
Oh, it's an old drawing my
dad did when he was a kid.

56:52.128 --> 56:54.733
Looks like a Tontonian.

56:56.926 --> 57:00.468
Hello, can anybody hear me?

57:00.470 --> 57:03.353
Ah, yeah, ah, funny story.

57:03.355 --> 57:06.378
We kind of get stranded
on that planet ear-th

57:06.380 --> 57:09.506
and we need your help.

57:09.508 --> 57:11.417
OK, I'll wait!

57:11.419 --> 57:12.528
What are they saying?

57:12.530 --> 57:13.850
They're trying to locate us.

57:13.852 --> 57:15.867
It might take a little while.

57:15.869 --> 57:17.292
I'll be right back!

57:17.294 --> 57:18.160
Mh?

57:26.226 --> 57:28.797
Dear Dad, looks
like you were right!

57:28.799 --> 57:32.588
Aliens do exist after all
and they're really cool!

57:33.665 --> 57:35.612
I'm going to have to leave with
them.

57:36.549 --> 57:38.912
Maybe you'll be able to spot me
in space

57:38.914 --> 57:40.614
with your telescope.

57:40.616 --> 57:43.293
I will remember you always, your
Luis.

58:06.338 --> 58:07.206
Huh?

58:08.353 --> 58:12.627
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah,
okay, yeah, gotcha, okay.

58:12.629 --> 58:13.739
What are they saying?

58:13.741 --> 58:15.790
Luis, is there an isolated
place

58:15.792 --> 58:17.527
where they can come pick us up?

58:17.529 --> 58:20.934
Um well, we just had our
class trip to Dragons Peak.

58:20.937 --> 58:22.358
There is never anyone up there.

58:22.360 --> 58:23.506
You get that?

58:23.508 --> 58:26.077
Aha, hm, Okay, thanks.

58:26.079 --> 58:27.190
Right, we have to be at the
top

58:27.192 --> 58:30.110
of Dragons Peak in 45 ee-yarth
minutes!

58:30.113 --> 58:32.439
They'll shine a beam that'll
pick us up!

58:33.971 --> 58:35.254
Huh?

58:39.531 --> 58:40.748
Freeze, huh?

58:54.165 --> 58:55.379
Who's there?

59:07.790 --> 59:10.395
Huh?

59:10.397 --> 59:13.906
What now?

59:18.391 --> 59:20.371
Oh, oh Mr. Sonntag!

59:20.373 --> 59:23.291
It's Mr. and Mrs. Winter, they,
they...

59:23.293 --> 59:24.159
They what?

59:24.162 --> 59:26.245
They tied me up!

59:26.247 --> 59:27.775
Listen, uh, Valentina,

59:27.777 --> 59:30.694
I try not to get involved
in people's personal lives.

59:30.696 --> 59:31.910
No, no, listen!

59:31.913 --> 59:33.788
They are not human.

59:33.790 --> 59:34.691
Come again?

59:34.693 --> 59:37.471
Their bodies are all
wibbly-wobbly

59:37.473 --> 59:40.149
and they can transform to look
like anyone

59:40.151 --> 59:42.824
and, and if you punch them in
the stomach

59:42.826 --> 59:45.120
they turn into, into, el
monstruoso!

59:45.954 --> 59:48.525
Oh, Senor Sonntag, I think
they're...

59:48.527 --> 59:50.610
Of course!

59:50.613 --> 59:51.619
What better way to disguise
yourself

59:51.621 --> 59:53.668
than as the perfect family?

59:53.670 --> 59:55.302
Why didn't I see it before?

59:55.304 --> 59:57.807
Come in my dear woman,
tell me all about it.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:03.089
Can you pilot this thing?

01:00:03.091 --> 01:00:06.217
Oof, this piece of
primitive tech, please!

01:00:06.219 --> 01:00:08.373
Adjust this, turn this.

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:11.745
Oh my gosh, oh.

01:00:13.379 --> 01:00:14.490
Mmh.

01:00:19.808 --> 01:00:22.833
Oh, oh, all under control!

01:00:30.203 --> 01:00:32.218
I meant to do that.

01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:37.499
Huh?

01:00:37.501 --> 01:00:38.717
Good news son!

01:00:38.719 --> 01:00:40.663
You're not grounded anymore.

01:00:40.665 --> 01:00:42.714
How about a family road trip?

01:00:42.716 --> 01:00:43.755
Uh, uh.

01:00:43.757 --> 01:00:45.945
Doesn't that sound lovely?

01:00:45.947 --> 01:00:46.850
What?

01:00:52.587 --> 01:00:54.218
Climb in, son!

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:56.789
Uh, that's the drivers seat.

01:00:56.791 --> 01:00:58.319
Exactly, young man!

01:00:58.321 --> 01:00:59.431
It's time to grow up

01:00:59.433 --> 01:01:02.594
by operating a motor
vehicle run on fossil fuels!

01:01:02.596 --> 01:01:03.534
Awesome, yo!

01:01:04.788 --> 01:01:06.348
Hi.

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.740
What's he doing here?

01:01:07.742 --> 01:01:08.642
Who, Luis?

01:01:08.644 --> 01:01:10.727
He's our friend.

01:01:10.729 --> 01:01:13.543
We should include him in
more things, don't you think?

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:16.220
I guess, where are we going?

01:01:16.222 --> 01:01:20.008
Well, we're taking a nice
little drive to Dragon's Peak!

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:21.433
Oh, that's boring.

01:01:21.435 --> 01:01:23.484
There's nothing to do there,
dawgs.

01:01:23.487 --> 01:01:25.118
That sounds perfect.

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.516
Come on, put the pedal to the
metal!

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.045
Huh?

01:02:03.006 --> 01:02:06.689
Marlon, get down here
immediately!

01:02:06.691 --> 01:02:09.366
You've got some explaining to
do!

01:02:09.368 --> 01:02:13.014
We can't leave that boy
alone for even a few hours!

01:02:13.016 --> 01:02:16.003
Oh, my therapist is gonna hear
about this!

01:02:18.752 --> 01:02:20.766
Sonntag, what on earth are...

01:02:20.768 --> 01:02:22.921
Get out here you filthy
creature!

01:02:22.923 --> 01:02:25.909
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is a historic moment.

01:02:25.912 --> 01:02:29.976
After years of futile
attempts, I, Armin Sonntag,

01:02:29.978 --> 01:02:31.853
can finally prove the existence

01:02:31.855 --> 01:02:34.218
of extraterrestrials beyond any
doubt!

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:35.365
What are you going on about?

01:02:35.367 --> 01:02:37.379
This man is crazy!

01:02:37.381 --> 01:02:39.396
- Hey over here.
- Yeah, yeah, right here.

01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:40.508
What's going on?

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.290
Who would have suspected
that my lovely neighbors

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:48.224
actually are in reality alien
invaders?

01:02:48.226 --> 01:02:50.483
Observe their flexible bodies.

01:02:50.485 --> 01:02:52.743
As soft and wobbly as Jello!

01:02:52.745 --> 01:02:54.724
And if you punch them in the
stomach,

01:02:54.726 --> 01:02:56.359
they revert to their alien form.

01:02:58.342 --> 01:03:00.841
That's it Sonntag,
I'm having you arrested!

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:02.269
Maybe a little harder.

01:03:08.422 --> 01:03:10.366
Go away, you dreadful alien
spawn!

01:03:10.368 --> 01:03:11.828
I'm a princess!

01:03:13.252 --> 01:03:14.919
Let's see what you revert to!

01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:16.101
We've seen enough!

01:03:16.103 --> 01:03:18.602
Yeah another false alarm,
crackpot!

01:03:18.604 --> 01:03:21.210
If we hurry maybe we can
get that Bigfoot story.

01:03:21.213 --> 01:03:23.713
And apparently it's just a
simple case

01:03:23.715 --> 01:03:25.381
of a neighborhood quarrel.

01:03:25.383 --> 01:03:28.474
Mr. Sonntag, have you seen
your son?

01:03:28.476 --> 01:03:30.699
Luis, what about Luis?

01:03:30.701 --> 01:03:32.020
I saw him!

01:03:32.022 --> 01:03:34.871
He was with the Winters, they
drove away a few minutes ago.

01:03:34.873 --> 01:03:36.608
That's impossible!

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:37.860
In your new SUV

01:03:39.599 --> 01:03:41.092
and Marlon was driving!

01:03:41.094 --> 01:03:42.066
What?

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:44.255
That's them, the real aliens

01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:46.237
and they have my son!

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.418
And our son!

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:49.851
Any idea where they were
going?

01:03:49.853 --> 01:03:52.562
I heard them mention Dragon's
Peak.

01:03:52.564 --> 01:03:53.468
Let's go!

01:03:55.657 --> 01:03:56.594
Oh, darn it

01:03:56.596 --> 01:03:58.609
A delivery for Mr. and Mrs.
Winter.

01:03:58.612 --> 01:04:00.594
A NubbiDubbi?

01:04:03.478 --> 01:04:05.042
How fast can this thing go?

01:04:18.668 --> 01:04:20.543
Hurry, they're getting away!

01:04:20.545 --> 01:04:22.593
Look, I appreciate the bribe,

01:04:22.595 --> 01:04:24.680
but there's a speed limit you
know!

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:31.004
Oh, for the love of, get out
of my way!

01:04:40.912 --> 01:04:42.579
I am a leaf.

01:04:42.581 --> 01:04:47.202
I am soaring through the
sky on a gentle breeze.

01:04:47.204 --> 01:04:50.922
That's good dear, stay in
your safe zone, remain calm.

01:04:50.924 --> 01:04:53.353
Oh shush Gary, how can I be
calm?

01:04:53.355 --> 01:04:57.107
What if our son has really
been abducted by aliens?

01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:58.395
Don't be silly, darling!

01:04:58.397 --> 01:05:01.837
There must be a simple explanation
for this whole thing!

01:05:29.053 --> 01:05:32.422
Watch it, will you,
this ain't a race car!

01:05:37.813 --> 01:05:38.751
You dropped something.

01:05:41.983 --> 01:05:43.060
It's a note from Luis.

01:05:46.189 --> 01:05:48.622
He's leaving with the aliens!

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.057
There, our SUV!

01:06:09.059 --> 01:06:11.802
Marlon!

01:06:20.217 --> 01:06:22.056
Hey, guys, we're being
followed

01:06:22.058 --> 01:06:23.797
by a humanoid carrier vehicle.

01:06:26.507 --> 01:06:28.594
And it's being
driven by Diekendaker!

01:06:31.409 --> 01:06:34.118
Come on, Marlon, engage warp
speed!

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.545
Oh!

01:06:38.848 --> 01:06:39.714
Have you lost your mind?

01:06:39.716 --> 01:06:42.182
Holy Jemimah, what are you
doing?

01:06:42.184 --> 01:06:45.519
No snotty nose kid is
gonna make a fool out of me!

01:06:47.153 --> 01:06:49.342
Why is a mail truck ramming
us?

01:06:49.344 --> 01:06:51.184
Oh, probably just jealous

01:06:51.187 --> 01:06:53.652
we're taking such a lovely
family trip.

01:07:00.258 --> 01:07:03.384
Think you
can escape me, think again!

01:07:06.515 --> 01:07:07.384
Watch out!

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:16.940
Hm.

01:07:18.994 --> 01:07:22.572
Good driving
son!

01:07:22.574 --> 01:07:24.621
I'm proud of you, boy of mine.

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:27.194
Yo, is somebody gonna finally
tell me

01:07:27.196 --> 01:07:28.931
what the heck is going on here?

01:07:28.933 --> 01:07:30.913
Why was that mail truck chasing
us?

01:07:30.915 --> 01:07:34.180
And what kind of family trip is
this?

01:07:34.182 --> 01:07:37.307
Well, at least he didn't
crash. We have to give him that.

01:07:37.309 --> 01:07:41.549
Okay, Marlon,
your parents, they well,

01:07:41.551 --> 01:07:43.426
they're not exactly your
parents.

01:07:43.428 --> 01:07:45.476
They're aliens.

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:46.207
They must be if they want to

01:07:46.209 --> 01:07:48.569
hang out with a freak like you!

01:07:48.571 --> 01:07:50.273
Luis isn't a freak!

01:07:50.275 --> 01:07:51.281
Jennifer?

01:07:51.283 --> 01:07:53.227
You just don't get it Marlon.

01:07:53.229 --> 01:07:54.271
Isn't that right, Patty?

01:07:54.273 --> 01:07:55.488
Hm-mm.

01:07:55.490 --> 01:07:56.356
What?

01:07:56.358 --> 01:07:57.607
Don't you understand?

01:07:57.609 --> 01:07:59.624
Luis is the first person on
Earth

01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:02.299
to be in contact with
extra-terrestrials!

01:08:02.301 --> 01:08:03.516
He's a trailblazer!

01:08:03.518 --> 01:08:05.394
Wait, you know?

01:08:05.396 --> 01:08:07.898
Of course I know, I'm a
journalist!

01:08:10.158 --> 01:08:11.199
Hm.

01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:14.847
Okay fine, my parents
are weirdos for sure,

01:08:14.849 --> 01:08:17.767
but there's no such thing as
aliens!

01:08:17.769 --> 01:08:18.812
Show him guys.

01:08:20.446 --> 01:08:21.938
- Ta-dah!
- Ta-dah!

01:08:21.939 --> 01:08:22.635
Ta-dah!

01:08:26.528 --> 01:08:29.238
Cool it, they won't hurt you!

01:08:30.004 --> 01:08:31.913
Patty, you getting this?

01:08:31.916 --> 01:08:32.785
Um.

01:08:49.782 --> 01:08:50.960
Come on, Luis!

01:08:50.962 --> 01:08:52.663
We have to get to the
highest point of the mountain

01:08:52.666 --> 01:08:54.437
so they can beam us up!

01:08:54.439 --> 01:08:57.356
You want to go with the
aliens?

01:08:57.358 --> 01:08:58.538
I have to.

01:08:58.541 --> 01:08:59.408
Why?

01:09:01.008 --> 01:09:03.231
I, I just have to.

01:09:06.292 --> 01:09:07.783
They're coming!

01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:17.761
Where did you learn to drive
lady?

01:09:22.837 --> 01:09:24.017
There, look!

01:09:35.558 --> 01:09:37.470
Luis, don't do it.

01:09:38.826 --> 01:09:40.526
Wow.

01:09:40.528 --> 01:09:41.639
Whoa, dude.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.863
We have to go, come on guys!

01:09:43.865 --> 01:09:45.913
Come on Patty!

01:09:49.774 --> 01:09:50.920
If they want to escape,

01:09:50.921 --> 01:09:53.282
they'll have to position
themselves under that ship.

01:09:53.283 --> 01:09:54.151
What are we waiting for?

01:09:54.153 --> 01:09:55.403
Let's go!

01:09:57.421 --> 01:09:58.497
Finally.

01:09:58.499 --> 01:09:59.366
At last!

01:10:08.926 --> 01:10:10.940
Luis, Luis, stop!

01:10:10.942 --> 01:10:12.747
Back away from the aliens!

01:10:12.749 --> 01:10:14.313
No Dad, you can't.

01:10:14.315 --> 01:10:15.701
They're my friends!

01:10:15.703 --> 01:10:17.023
But you can't leave with them,
Luis!

01:10:17.025 --> 01:10:18.829
Are you crazy?

01:10:18.831 --> 01:10:21.402
Why, what do you even care?

01:10:21.404 --> 01:10:23.315
What, what do you mean?

01:10:23.317 --> 01:10:25.330
Why would you say something like
that?

01:10:25.332 --> 01:10:27.728
You never pay any attention to
me.

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:30.543
You don't even know what day it
is today.

01:10:30.545 --> 01:10:31.831
It's my birthday, Dad!

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:34.369
Luis, I.

01:10:35.585 --> 01:10:38.850
And I bet you don't even
know what color my eyes are!

01:10:38.852 --> 01:10:42.293
All you care about is
your work, nothing else!

01:10:42.295 --> 01:10:44.133
You don't have any time for me.

01:10:44.135 --> 01:10:45.906
That's why they want to
put me into that home,

01:10:45.908 --> 01:10:47.299
with that creepy lady!

01:10:48.481 --> 01:10:52.338
Trust me, your boy will
be in good hands with me.

01:10:52.340 --> 01:10:54.492
What, what are you talking
about?

01:10:54.494 --> 01:10:59.464
No, no Luis, they can't take
you away from me, I love you.

01:11:00.855 --> 01:11:03.077
You, you never say that.

01:11:03.079 --> 01:11:05.268
You're all I have.

01:11:05.270 --> 01:11:06.833
You're my everything Luis!

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.413
Give me a chance to be
a better father, please!

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:16.008
And they're blue, your eyes,
they're turquoise blue!

01:11:16.705 --> 01:11:18.753
Just like your mother's.

01:11:27.167 --> 01:11:30.224
Ah, enough of this miserable
farce!

01:11:30.226 --> 01:11:31.962
Have you lost your mind?

01:11:34.362 --> 01:11:35.923
What are you doing?

01:11:35.925 --> 01:11:38.114
Luis, come here immediately!

01:11:38.116 --> 01:11:39.540
No, don't!

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.244
I'll count to three.

01:11:42.217 --> 01:11:46.630
One, two, three.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:49.514
Drop the gun!

01:11:49.516 --> 01:11:51.878
Game over, Ms. Diekendaker!

01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:56.051
Or should I say Miss Kychon 3X7,
hm?

01:12:00.430 --> 01:12:01.367
What's going on?

01:12:01.369 --> 01:12:03.660
This fine lady works for a
crime-lord

01:12:03.663 --> 01:12:05.120
from the planet Tonton!

01:12:05.122 --> 01:12:07.832
She sells human Children's
tears!

01:12:07.834 --> 01:12:10.925
On her planet every single
tear is almost priceless.

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:11.900
They cure baldness.

01:12:13.499 --> 01:12:15.062
Mm, baldness eh?

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.078
Is any of that true?

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:18.329
Who are you going to believe,

01:12:18.331 --> 01:12:22.291
me or some crazy ice cream man?

01:12:22.293 --> 01:12:24.483
That was only my clever
disguise!

01:12:25.630 --> 01:12:28.548
Now, what I'm going to show
you, may come as an surprise.

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:33.729
In fact, I am, Agent Stu of
the Intergalactic Hero Squad.

01:12:37.447 --> 01:12:38.733
Oh, oh, just a sec.

01:12:41.272 --> 01:12:43.216
I been following this villainess

01:12:43.218 --> 01:12:45.719
through the galaxy for some time
now.

01:12:45.721 --> 01:12:48.569
Keeping a close eye on
her despicable scheming.

01:12:48.571 --> 01:12:50.689
But finally the time has come

01:12:50.691 --> 01:12:52.774
to put an end on her dastardly
plan

01:12:52.776 --> 01:12:55.939
and bring her to justice.

01:13:15.752 --> 01:13:18.043
Oh no, it's a Tontonian!

01:13:18.044 --> 01:13:18.408
What?

01:13:18.409 --> 01:13:20.549
The worst criminals in the
whole galaxy.

01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:23.535
Quick, let's get outta
here while it's distracted.

01:13:25.172 --> 01:13:26.281
Luis?

01:13:37.198 --> 01:13:40.220
It's you, you're the.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:57.288
Mr.Sonntag, Mr.Sonntag,
get away from there!

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:01.076
Oh no!

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:06.809
Luis!

01:14:12.582 --> 01:14:13.588
Listen carefully, Luis!

01:14:13.590 --> 01:14:16.855
You must set the
Shockfroster to full power!

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:19.393
Come on my boy, you can do it!

01:14:24.052 --> 01:14:25.095
Ah!

01:14:26.112 --> 01:14:30.350
No, leave my son alone,
you miserable creature.

01:14:37.548 --> 01:14:40.777
On behalf of the
intergalactic confederation,

01:14:40.779 --> 01:14:43.072
you are under arrest.

01:15:30.607 --> 01:15:31.650
- Psst.
- Huh?

01:16:05.885 --> 01:16:06.999
Sorry, wrong Luis.

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:13.043
Yoo-hoo, I'm Luis!

01:16:13.045 --> 01:16:16.555
Oh boy.

01:16:16.557 --> 01:16:19.057
No, I am.

01:16:20.728 --> 01:16:21.596
Whoa.

01:16:23.541 --> 01:16:24.376
Hey you!

01:16:26.706 --> 01:16:27.609
I'm Luis!

01:16:42.854 --> 01:16:44.971
Luis!

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.001
Oh son!

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.649
Dad!

01:16:52.651 --> 01:16:53.834
Can you ever forgive me?

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:58.733
Let me through, I'm from the
press!

01:17:05.268 --> 01:17:06.761
Sorry, Mom.

01:17:06.763 --> 01:17:08.710
Who cares.

01:17:10.656 --> 01:17:12.009
I'm a princess!

01:17:12.011 --> 01:17:13.781
Oh, yes you are honey.

01:17:13.783 --> 01:17:17.535
Oh.

01:17:17.537 --> 01:17:20.943
Hey look,
she move, her eyes moved!

01:17:20.945 --> 01:17:24.246
Don't worry, she can't
hurt anybody any more!

01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:25.911
What will you do with it?

01:17:25.913 --> 01:17:28.484
She will be brought before
an intergalactic court

01:17:28.486 --> 01:17:31.196
and until then I'll store
her in my cooling house,

01:17:31.198 --> 01:17:32.726
next to the Ice cream.

01:17:32.728 --> 01:17:34.499
Because I have an ice
cream truck, you know?

01:17:34.501 --> 01:17:36.062
Because I was pretending
to be an ice cream man,

01:17:36.064 --> 01:17:36.931
yes you know...

01:17:36.933 --> 01:17:38.495
Yeah, okay we get it!

01:17:38.497 --> 01:17:43.083
But uh, why was she I mean it,
after Luis?

01:17:43.085 --> 01:17:45.308
Oh well, you see, on planet
Tonton,

01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:47.394
there is no substance more
precious

01:17:47.396 --> 01:17:50.487
than a lonely human
child's tears, you know?

01:17:50.489 --> 01:17:52.676
Tears, from the eyes,
of a child who is alone?

01:17:52.678 --> 01:17:55.665
You are a lonely child, aren't
you?

01:17:55.668 --> 01:17:58.655
Uh, I guess I used to be.

01:18:01.368 --> 01:18:05.120
Will somebody please just
sign for the darn NubbiDubbi?

01:18:05.122 --> 01:18:06.234
I'll take it!

01:18:11.065 --> 01:18:14.401
- The NubbiDubbi, yippee!
- The NubbiDubbi, alright!

01:18:14.403 --> 01:18:15.408
Come on, Luis!

01:18:15.410 --> 01:18:16.764
Let's try the NubbiDubbi out!

01:18:16.766 --> 01:18:19.753
Um, there's something
I gotta tell you, guys.

01:18:19.755 --> 01:18:20.624
Huh?

01:18:21.493 --> 01:18:22.745
I'm not going with you.

01:18:23.823 --> 01:18:24.794
- Huh?
- Oh no!

01:18:24.796 --> 01:18:25.836
Why not?

01:18:25.838 --> 01:18:28.789
- Are you sure?
- We had so much fun together!

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.918
Yeah, but my home's here
on earth, with my Dad.

01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:34.318
And with your little
girlfriend, eh?

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:37.202
I see how she looks at you, huh,
huh?

01:18:37.204 --> 01:18:40.260
Ooh.

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:42.276
I really wish you guys could
stay!

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:48.709
Yeah, let's get going
before we all start to cry!

01:18:50.934 --> 01:18:52.705
Alright.

01:18:52.707 --> 01:18:54.685
- So long!
- Bye, yearthboy!

01:18:54.687 --> 01:18:55.866
I'll never be back!

01:18:55.869 --> 01:18:57.257
Bye guys!

01:18:57.259 --> 01:18:59.239
Give my love to
Valentina!

01:18:59.241 --> 01:19:01.359
Oop, up we go.

01:19:21.833 --> 01:19:24.264
I'm really gonna miss
them.

01:19:24.266 --> 01:19:26.420
I'm glad we were here,

01:19:26.422 --> 01:19:28.473
even if I didn't get any good
shots.

01:19:29.654 --> 01:19:30.524
Huh?

01:19:34.484 --> 01:19:36.814
Oh Patty, you're beautiful!

01:19:38.031 --> 01:19:40.671
Come on, start rolling!

01:19:40.673 --> 01:19:42.616
Sorry if I was a bad neighbor.

01:19:42.619 --> 01:19:44.146
Over here, Mr. Sonntag.

01:19:44.148 --> 01:19:46.266
I'm here for an exclusive
interview

01:19:46.269 --> 01:19:48.908
with the renowned Ufologist
Armin Sonntag,

01:19:48.910 --> 01:19:52.350
who has finally be able to
prove the existence of aliens.

01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:54.748
Mr. Sonntag, what are your
plans?

01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:56.554
Will you extend your research

01:19:56.556 --> 01:19:58.814
or will you travel the
world giving lectures?

01:19:58.816 --> 01:20:01.700
For heaven sakes,
no!

01:20:01.702 --> 01:20:03.924
I have far better things to do!

01:21:26.407 --> 01:21:28.248
Whoa.

01:21:29.465 --> 01:21:30.541
Whoa.

01:21:30.544 --> 01:21:33.287
It goes all the way up to 11.

01:23:19.303 --> 01:23:24.511
