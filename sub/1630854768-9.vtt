00:01.894 --> 00:04.461
(upbeat music playing)

00:06.899 --> 00:08.632
That was an amazing game,
Mouse.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.658
Thank you, Mr. Dawson.

00:10.678 --> 00:14.346
I mean it. Two goals
against the Hammers?

00:14.498 --> 00:17.424
Your mom and dad are gonna
be so proud of you, honey.

00:17.501 --> 00:19.685
You know they wanted
to be there, but--

00:19.836 --> 00:20.911
Work.

00:20.913 --> 00:23.263
Hey, I got both
your goals on video

00:23.415 --> 00:25.599
so we can show them
when we get home.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.584
-(cheering)
-WOMAN (on video):
<i> Yeah, yeah, come on!</i>

00:27.586 --> 00:28.877
(whooping)

00:28.954 --> 00:30.195
That was really cool
of you to do.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.698
-Thank you, Mrs. Dawson.
-MRS. DAWSON: You got it.

00:32.891 --> 00:34.033
I just have one note.

00:34.109 --> 00:35.517
Why didn't you celebrate?

00:35.594 --> 00:38.428
Because it's Mouse, Mom.
She never celebrates.

00:38.430 --> 00:40.264
MRS. DAWSON:
I don't care who you are.

00:40.266 --> 00:43.525
You hit the game-winner against
the best team in the state,

00:43.544 --> 00:44.951
you celebrate!

00:45.028 --> 00:47.046
I don't want anyone to feel bad.

00:47.197 --> 00:49.048
Can I give you
a piece of advice?

00:49.124 --> 00:50.440
Never hide your light

00:50.442 --> 00:52.968
because it'll make
somebody else feel bad.

00:54.037 --> 00:56.037
Okay, so let's hear it.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.223
-What?
-Your celebration, silly.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.375
Next time you score a goal,
what are you gonna do?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.969
-I don't know.
-Ooh. I know what I'd do.

01:03.122 --> 01:05.122
-A big balls celebration.
-Joey!

01:05.124 --> 01:06.398
(chuckling) Not helpful.

01:06.625 --> 01:09.684
How about the classic
"Goa-a-al!"

01:09.795 --> 01:11.144
Like the TV guy, huh?

01:11.297 --> 01:12.237
-Come on.
-ALL: Goa-a-al!

01:12.464 --> 01:15.723
-ALL: Goa-a-al!
-Go, go, goa-a-al!

01:15.801 --> 01:16.724
ALL: Goa-a-al!

01:16.744 --> 01:17.725
Mr. Dawson!

01:17.745 --> 01:19.745
-(horn blaring)
-Oh, God!

01:19.896 --> 01:23.248
(theme music plays)

01:24.827 --> 01:26.901
Good job, 126.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.478
Oh, Mateo,
you got a little, uh...

01:28.497 --> 01:30.905
PAUL STRICKLAND:
You got something--
it's right there.

01:30.925 --> 01:32.165
(laughter)

01:32.318 --> 01:34.818
(cell phone buzzing)

01:34.820 --> 01:36.153
Hey, it's Marwani.

01:36.171 --> 01:37.671
-Hey-o. Is that Marjan?
-OWEN STRAND: Hey, Marjan!

01:37.823 --> 01:38.839
<i> Hey!</i>

01:38.991 --> 01:39.747
How's my girl?

01:39.767 --> 01:40.933
<i> Good.</i>

01:41.084 --> 01:43.102
<i> You were talking about</i>
<i> the bike, weren't you?</i>

01:43.253 --> 01:44.328
Of course,
I meant the bike.

01:44.330 --> 01:45.420
Well, I sold her.

01:45.664 --> 01:47.831
Pretty good price.
I got $200 more than I paid you.

01:47.833 --> 01:48.774
<i> You're hilarious.</i>

01:48.925 --> 01:50.258
MATEO CHAVEZ:
<i> Hey, what's up, Marj?</i>

01:50.277 --> 01:52.185
PAUL:
<i> Hey-o. Is that Marjan?</i>

01:52.262 --> 01:53.261
<i> Hey, what's up, girl?</i>

01:53.355 --> 01:54.171
Aw!

01:54.506 --> 01:56.115
You guys look like
you're having fun.

01:56.266 --> 01:58.024
Yeah, we just knocked down
a five-alarm fire

01:58.101 --> 01:59.359
in a sausage factory.

01:59.511 --> 02:01.286
It made me so hungry.
It smelled so delicious.

02:01.363 --> 02:03.180
JUDD RYDER:
<i> Ooh, you got that right.</i>

02:03.198 --> 02:04.456
<i> Hey, is that Marjan?</i>

02:04.608 --> 02:05.641
Oh, hey!

02:05.643 --> 02:06.774
I miss you guys.

02:06.794 --> 02:07.793
So come back!

02:07.944 --> 02:09.703
Okay.

02:09.855 --> 02:10.963
Okay? Did you say "okay"?

02:11.156 --> 02:12.539
<i> Yeah, I mean,</i>
<i> assuming you haven't</i>

02:12.691 --> 02:13.948
<i> replaced me already.</i>

02:13.968 --> 02:16.209
No, we haven't replaced you.
You're irreplaceable.

02:16.362 --> 02:17.544
Are you sure you're
ready to come back?

02:17.621 --> 02:18.953
<i> Yeah, I'm ready.</i>

02:19.031 --> 02:20.380
<i> Like, really ready.</i>

02:20.532 --> 02:21.807
-PAUL: Awesome, yeah!
-MATEO: Cool.

02:21.958 --> 02:22.808
MARJAN MARWANI:
<i> Okay, okay, okay.</i>

02:22.885 --> 02:24.459
Just promise me one thing.

02:24.536 --> 02:26.370
Please don't make
a big deal out of this.

02:26.372 --> 02:28.555
I don't need you guys
being all... extra.

02:28.707 --> 02:30.649
<i> Why would you think</i>
<i> we'd be all extra?</i>

02:30.726 --> 02:31.984
Dude, you gave your dad

02:32.060 --> 02:33.968
a tumor-shaped cake
when he beat cancer.

02:34.046 --> 02:36.046
Alright. We promise.
No parties.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.972
-<i> Where are you?</i>
-Uh, Tucumcari.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.549
<i> New Mexico?</i>
<i> You can be here by tonight.</i>

02:39.568 --> 02:41.493
No, I've had a pretty
eventful couple days.

02:41.645 --> 02:42.995
I think I'm gonna
grab a motel room

02:43.146 --> 02:45.238
and then maybe hit the road
first thing in the morning?

02:45.315 --> 02:47.315
Alright. So you'll be
in Austin by four o'clock.

02:47.334 --> 02:48.816
Why don't you just
come right to my house?

02:48.894 --> 02:50.652
Don't even bother going home.

02:50.729 --> 02:51.895
<i> Your place? Why?</i>

02:51.914 --> 02:53.922
So we can get
the paperwork sorted out.

02:55.234 --> 02:57.509
<i> Can't we just do that</i>
<i> on Tuesday at work?</i>

02:57.586 --> 03:00.086
Well, I think it's better
to just get it out of the way.

03:00.239 --> 03:02.422
You're throwing a party,
aren't you?

03:02.574 --> 03:04.999
ALL:<i> Yeah!</i>

03:05.019 --> 03:08.020
Okay, fine, fine.
But no yacht rock, okay?

03:08.096 --> 03:09.855
<i> -Oh!</i>
-(all jeering)

03:10.006 --> 03:11.005
<i> Alright, drive safe.</i>

03:11.007 --> 03:12.274
I will.

03:15.587 --> 03:16.920
Hey.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.104
Did you get a seat?

03:18.257 --> 03:19.847
I'm on the 8:45
to Fort Lauderdale.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.608
Amazing!

03:21.760 --> 03:24.761
Okay, do me a favor, Kiley,
and, uh,

03:24.763 --> 03:26.112
put this in your backpack.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.165
What? What is this?

03:31.453 --> 03:32.544
Marjan.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.697
I can't accept this.

03:35.774 --> 03:36.698
Yes, you can.

03:36.775 --> 03:37.883
I blew up your old life.

03:38.034 --> 03:40.277
The least I can do
is help you start a new one.

03:40.295 --> 03:42.462
Where did you even
get all of this?

03:42.614 --> 03:43.555
I sold my bike.

03:44.225 --> 03:45.373
No.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.118
-Oh, my God. You shouldn't have.
-It's okay.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.878
I've eaten enough diesel exhaust
to last me a lifetime.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.213
But how are you getting home?

03:52.233 --> 03:53.899
I don't know, I'll get
a rental car or something.

03:53.976 --> 03:55.216
Don't even sweat it.

03:55.236 --> 03:57.194
(over PA):<i> ...8:45 bus</i>
<i> to Fort Lauderdale.</i>

03:59.965 --> 04:01.465
Hey, what's-what's-what's
going on?

04:01.483 --> 04:05.318
What if getting on that bus is
the biggest mistake of my life?

04:05.395 --> 04:07.287
I mean, look at
how happy we were.

04:08.824 --> 04:11.750
No, those aren't real, Kiley.

04:11.827 --> 04:14.086
That was posted for show.

04:14.162 --> 04:15.662
What I saw
when you were with him,

04:15.814 --> 04:18.648
the look of terror in your eyes?

04:18.667 --> 04:20.150
That was real.

04:20.152 --> 04:21.909
Grant will have
posted bail by now.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.720
This is your chance
to break free.

04:24.673 --> 04:25.989
You have to take it.

04:25.991 --> 04:28.008
Grant was my home.

04:28.084 --> 04:29.175
MARJAN:
You thought he was.

04:29.252 --> 04:31.161
When you find your real home,

04:31.163 --> 04:32.938
you'll feel the difference.

04:33.089 --> 04:34.523
Believe me.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.092
(sniffles)

04:38.170 --> 04:39.695
I'm so scared...

04:40.839 --> 04:42.239
doing this alone.

04:43.933 --> 04:47.193
And that's what
makes you so brave

04:47.346 --> 04:49.103
because you're doing it anyways.

04:49.181 --> 04:50.680
And you won't
be alone, okay?

04:50.699 --> 04:54.200
My sister Sahar lives just
down the road in Miami Beach.

04:54.277 --> 04:56.628
She has the place wired.

04:56.780 --> 04:57.945
I'll text you her number.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.048
Thank you, Marjan...

05:00.617 --> 05:01.783
for everything.

05:05.121 --> 05:07.030
(Kiley inhales and exhales)

05:07.032 --> 05:09.683
Go, enjoy your life.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.019
You deserve it.

(ominous music playing)

05:25.050 --> 05:26.533
(bus engine revving)

05:35.561 --> 05:37.985
Man, I don't know about y'all,
but I'm getting a serious case

05:38.005 --> 05:39.245
of carpal tunnel over here.

05:39.398 --> 05:41.155
Right?
If Captain Vega was here,

05:41.233 --> 05:42.490
I would be submitting
for hazard pay.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.676
Yeah, she's lucky
she missed this assignment.

05:44.753 --> 05:45.677
Well, that's debatable.

05:45.995 --> 05:47.995
She's at her 11-year-old's
ballet recital,

05:48.073 --> 05:49.848
and it's supposed
to go for four hours.

05:49.999 --> 05:50.740
(scoffs) Ouch.

05:50.742 --> 05:52.075
Is Grace coming by?

05:52.094 --> 05:54.411
Nah, she can't. Actually,
her shift starts at 5:00

05:54.413 --> 05:57.097
so I told her
I'll bring her a piece of cake.

05:57.249 --> 05:58.023
-(oven dings)
-OWEN: Alright.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.858
The mushroom canapés are out.

05:59.935 --> 06:01.843
The short ribs and bruschetta
are cooking.

06:01.862 --> 06:05.179
Uh, salmon and cucumber canapés
are in the refrigerator.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.014
What else am I missing?

06:07.109 --> 06:08.108
Oh, yeah.

06:08.260 --> 06:10.427
The fig and-and brie canapés.
Duh.

06:10.429 --> 06:12.871
That's a lot of canapés
on 24 hours' notice.

06:13.022 --> 06:13.930
I have a guy.

06:13.949 --> 06:14.948
Hey, Dad, remember,

06:15.100 --> 06:17.376
she didn't want us
getting too extra.

06:17.452 --> 06:20.194
Oh, this isn't "extra."
I am never "extra."

06:20.272 --> 06:22.789
People, we must
have more LED balloons.

06:22.866 --> 06:25.083
I do not wanna see any light.

06:25.160 --> 06:27.127
I wanna see
this whole ceiling covered.

06:27.279 --> 06:28.870
He's still not over us

06:28.889 --> 06:30.204
not letting him
plan the wedding, is he?

06:30.449 --> 06:32.282
Yeah, we just gotta let him
figure it out on his own.

06:32.300 --> 06:35.209
And you know what?
I think we may have
dodged a bullet.

06:35.303 --> 06:36.711
In the shape of a canapé.

can anyone hear me,

I need police.

08:02.874 --> 08:04.224
I didn't know how to wake you.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.276
My friends need help.

08:08.063 --> 08:09.154
Wh-what happened?

08:09.231 --> 08:10.880
There was an accident.

08:10.899 --> 08:12.991
You drove off the road.

08:13.068 --> 08:14.493
Into a ditch.

08:14.978 --> 08:16.569
Yeah.

08:16.722 --> 08:18.371
I do that sometimes.

08:20.408 --> 08:21.725
Ah!

08:21.727 --> 08:22.959
Are you okay?

08:23.337 --> 08:24.227
(groans)

08:24.338 --> 08:27.297
Feels like I broke
a couple ribs.

08:30.402 --> 08:34.179
Probably a concussion, too,
I'm guessing.

08:36.074 --> 08:38.016
Where-where did you come from?

08:38.167 --> 08:40.227
I was in the accident, too.

A red car.

08:42.748 --> 08:45.081
My friend and his parents,
they're still stuck in the car.

08:45.100 --> 08:46.733
Please, you have to help them.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.935
Yeah.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.737
I'll-I'll-I'll call for help.

08:55.610 --> 08:56.493
Or not.

08:59.022 --> 09:00.613
Okay, kid.

09:00.766 --> 09:02.499
Come on. Show me.

09:11.793 --> 09:13.343
(coughs)

09:18.967 --> 09:21.309
(heavy breathing)

09:22.729 --> 09:23.687
(groans)

09:31.630 --> 09:32.654
(groans)

09:33.740 --> 09:35.965
(groaning)

09:35.984 --> 09:38.243
(panting)

09:48.830 --> 09:50.171
(items clatter)

10:03.604 --> 10:04.603
(sharp exhale)

10:11.945 --> 10:13.570
(heavy breathing)

10:15.598 --> 10:16.489
(winces)

10:17.600 --> 10:18.524
(groans)

10:18.677 --> 10:20.619
(panting)

10:27.035 --> 10:28.668
(heavy breathing)

10:35.210 --> 10:36.468
MOUSE:
You can lean on me.

10:36.619 --> 10:38.803
MARJAN: You know,
you're pretty strong for--

10:38.955 --> 10:40.880
What are you, eleven?

10:41.032 --> 10:41.865
Twelve?

10:41.883 --> 10:43.391
Ten.

10:43.869 --> 10:44.976
Oh.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.704
What's your name?

10:47.706 --> 10:49.731
People call me Mouse.

10:50.651 --> 10:52.150
Mouse?

10:52.301 --> 10:54.043
That's probably, uh--

10:54.062 --> 10:56.321
That's probably 'cause you're...

10:56.398 --> 10:59.616
pretty mouthy, huh?
(panting)

11:00.402 --> 11:01.326
No.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.871
(winces sharply)

11:04.981 --> 11:06.147
My name's, my name's Marjan.

11:06.166 --> 11:07.999
And you're in luck 'cause,

11:08.076 --> 11:10.168
'cause I'm a firefighter.

11:10.319 --> 11:11.244
Okay?

11:11.396 --> 11:13.338
And we're gonna
get through this.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.916
You said the car's
right around here?

11:17.068 --> 11:19.085
Uh... I thought so.

11:19.162 --> 11:22.088
Maybe I got turned around.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.256
MARJAN:
That's okay. It's okay.
Come on.

11:23.332 --> 11:25.183
We'll just,
we'll keep looking, okay?

11:26.002 --> 11:28.169
You play soccer, huh?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.246
MOUSE:
How did you know?

11:30.265 --> 11:32.440
Your uniform
kinda gave you away.

11:32.934 --> 11:34.341
Right.

11:34.419 --> 11:35.193
(pants)

11:35.437 --> 11:38.697
What, uh,
what position do you play?

11:38.924 --> 11:41.257
-Striker.
-No way!

11:41.276 --> 11:43.410
That was my favorite position.

11:44.112 --> 11:45.929
(twig snaps)

11:45.931 --> 11:47.764
MOUSE:
What? What is it?

11:47.782 --> 11:48.765
Nothing. Nothing. Uh--

11:48.783 --> 11:50.934
I just, I wanna make sure

11:50.952 --> 11:52.526
I know how to get back, okay?

11:52.546 --> 11:53.753
Come on.

11:59.961 --> 12:02.295
-Is that it?
-MOUSE: Yes.

12:02.447 --> 12:04.781
It's a miracle
you made it out of there.

12:04.799 --> 12:07.058
MOUSE:
Joey! Mr. and Mrs. Dawson!

12:07.210 --> 12:08.876
I brought a firefighter.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.578
Hey, hey.
Hey, listen, sweetheart,

12:10.580 --> 12:12.713
I think it's better if you just,
if you stay here, okay?

12:12.733 --> 12:14.065
But I wanna help you.

12:14.217 --> 12:16.626
I'm gonna do everything I can
to help your friends.

12:16.644 --> 12:17.885
I-I promise.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.386
So I need you to do me a favor.

12:19.464 --> 12:21.239
And you're just gonna
sit down here, okay?

12:21.390 --> 12:24.650
And, uh, look up at the trees
a-and count to 100,

12:24.803 --> 12:28.747
and whatever you do, just--
Don't-don't turn around, okay?

12:28.898 --> 12:30.415
-Okay.
-MARJAN: Okay.

12:30.825 --> 12:31.750
Okay.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.507
One, two...

12:40.594 --> 12:43.344
three, four...

12:44.172 --> 12:47.766
five, six, seven...

12:47.842 --> 12:49.158
(winces sharply)

12:49.177 --> 12:51.728
...eight, nine...

12:53.089 --> 12:54.330
-ten...
-(winces sharply)

12:54.349 --> 12:55.164
(panting)

12:55.183 --> 12:58.759
MOUSE:
...eleven, twelve,

12:58.853 --> 13:01.571
thirteen, fourteen...

13:02.857 --> 13:05.191
fifteen, sixteen...

13:05.343 --> 13:06.192
(groans)

13:06.344 --> 13:10.163
MOUSE:
...seventeen, eighteen...

13:10.957 --> 13:14.250
nineteen, twenty...

13:15.128 --> 13:18.338
twenty-one, twenty-two...

13:19.299 --> 13:22.358
twenty-three, twenty-four...

13:22.377 --> 13:23.968
-(Marjan winces)
-MOUSE: ...twenty-five...

13:24.120 --> 13:25.637
(panting)

13:25.713 --> 13:27.138
MOUSE:
...twenty-six...

13:28.033 --> 13:30.683
twenty-seven, twenty-eight...

13:31.794 --> 13:35.313
twenty-nine, thirty...

13:35.464 --> 13:39.300
-thirty-one, thirty-two...
-(Marjan groans)

13:39.319 --> 13:43.137
MOUSE:
...thirty-three, thirty-four...

13:43.156 --> 13:46.533
thirty-five, thirty-six...

13:49.996 --> 13:52.205
They're dead, aren't they?

13:54.984 --> 13:56.751
MARJAN:
Um... (panting)

13:59.506 --> 14:00.913
I'm so sorry.

14:01.066 --> 14:02.841
(exhales)
It's all my fault.

14:02.992 --> 14:05.068
No, no, no, no, Mouse, no.

14:05.161 --> 14:07.070
-It is not your fault.
-MOUSE: It is.

14:07.163 --> 14:09.088
They were teaching me
how to celebrate a goal,

14:09.165 --> 14:11.090
and Mr. Dawson
took his eyes off the road.

14:11.167 --> 14:12.833
If I hadn't had
driven into your lane,

14:12.853 --> 14:14.352
none of this would
have happened, okay?

14:14.503 --> 14:17.397
So if it's anybody's fault,
it's mine.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.932
You understand?

14:20.009 --> 14:21.675
We really have to
get out of here, Mouse.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.320
We need to go to the top
of the road and get some help.

14:25.699 --> 14:26.531
(Marjan winces)

14:32.355 --> 14:34.597
Can I say goodbye to him first?

14:34.599 --> 14:35.498
(sniffles)

14:37.060 --> 14:38.293
Joey.

14:39.695 --> 14:41.254
He's my best friend.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.941
Hey, no, I think--

14:45.034 --> 14:48.219
I think it's better if
you say goodbye in your head.

14:48.296 --> 14:51.180
-Okay?
-How do I do that?

14:55.562 --> 14:57.186
Close your eyes.

14:58.547 --> 15:03.217
Think of a time when you
were truly happy together.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.962
Do you have a memory like that?

15:05.980 --> 15:09.198
Last season,
Joey scored his first goal.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.034
His only goal.

15:11.894 --> 15:13.894
He was so happy
he hugged me

15:13.972 --> 15:16.155
in front of everybody.

15:16.232 --> 15:19.292
Then I want you to
think of him just like that.

15:21.070 --> 15:22.845
'Cause that's how happy
he'll always be

15:22.847 --> 15:25.423
as long as you
carry that with you.

15:26.927 --> 15:30.153
Now I want you to tell him
that you won't

15:30.155 --> 15:32.263
ever forget him.

15:35.677 --> 15:36.559
Okay.

15:37.512 --> 15:38.561
I told him.

15:39.847 --> 15:41.314
Good job, honey.

15:42.016 --> 15:43.274
Come on.

15:47.355 --> 15:48.854
JUDD:
Well, Cap, I hate to say it,

15:48.931 --> 15:50.097
but I think, uh,
you're gonna have to

15:50.116 --> 15:52.341
put your salmon canapés
back in the fridge.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.268
Yeah, these fishes are not
swimming upstream anymore, Cap.

15:54.362 --> 15:56.862
This is a disaster.
Where is she?

15:56.864 --> 15:58.105
Mateo, any news?

15:58.124 --> 15:59.290
Straight to voice mail.

15:59.367 --> 16:01.459
Maybe she doesn't
have service.

16:01.536 --> 16:04.203
She's on the interstate.
She should have service.

16:04.355 --> 16:05.521
TK STRAND:
Maybe she's
on the motorcycle

16:05.540 --> 16:06.872
and she can't hear
the phone calls coming in.

16:07.192 --> 16:08.874
No, no, no, no.
All that stuff goes
right into the helmet.

16:08.951 --> 16:09.950
-That's not an issue.
-Oh, God.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.469
She did tell us
she didn't want a party.

16:11.787 --> 16:14.530
Yeah, but Marjan
wouldn't ghost us, right?
She is not like that.

16:14.532 --> 16:16.324
NANCY GILLIAN:
Well, maybe she just
turned off her phone

16:16.400 --> 16:18.142
and she's, like,
taking the scenic route.

16:18.219 --> 16:20.261
We're talking
about Firefox, Nancy.

16:20.371 --> 16:22.647
The woman
never has her phone off,

16:22.724 --> 16:23.630
and she's never late.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.649
I mean, am I wrong, Cap?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.059
Not once in three years.

16:27.136 --> 16:29.654
Do we start
calling hospitals?

16:29.805 --> 16:32.156
Hang on.
I got a better idea.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.243
(keypad beeping)

16:35.978 --> 16:37.720
(line ringing)

16:37.722 --> 16:39.998
(cell phone ringing)

16:43.228 --> 16:44.410
-Hey, husband.
-JUDD (over phone):
<i> Hey, Gracie.</i>

16:44.562 --> 16:46.245
I got you on speaker
at Marjan's party.

16:46.397 --> 16:49.081
Hmm.
Okay, so you're calling
to rub my face in it, huh?

16:49.234 --> 16:50.399
<i> We missed you, Marjan.</i>

16:50.493 --> 16:51.509
JUDD:
No, no, sweetheart,
she ain't here.

16:51.660 --> 16:52.902
That's what
we're callin' about.

16:52.920 --> 16:53.919
She should have been here
about two hours ago,

16:54.072 --> 16:55.496
and she's not
answering her phone.

16:55.757 --> 16:57.423
OWEN (over phone):
<i> Hey, Grace, I'm sending you</i>
<i> her contacts.</i>

16:57.575 --> 16:59.726
Can you try to get
a location on her phone?

17:00.836 --> 17:03.479
Uh, let me try tracking her GPS.

17:06.768 --> 17:08.675
I'm not seeing her.

17:08.695 --> 17:10.920
Hey, Grace,
when was the last time
she used her phone?

17:10.922 --> 17:13.105
It was about
an hour and a half ago.

17:13.258 --> 17:15.883
Two calls,
both under three seconds.

17:15.960 --> 17:16.850
What were the numbers?

17:16.870 --> 17:18.594
It was to 9-1-1.

17:18.613 --> 17:20.112
<i> Both came into</i>
<i> Mason County Dispatch,</i>

17:20.206 --> 17:21.764
and both of 'em dropped.

17:21.766 --> 17:22.373
Okay, so that's bad.

17:22.617 --> 17:23.690
Mason County, alright, that--

17:23.768 --> 17:25.268
That must mean
she was on Highway 71.

17:25.270 --> 17:28.120
OWEN:
Grace, can you check
for accidents on Highway 71

17:28.197 --> 17:29.047
in Mason County?

17:29.123 --> 17:30.623
Mm-mm. I'm not seeing any.

17:30.775 --> 17:32.383
Anyone know what time
she left this morning?

17:32.535 --> 17:33.943
Uh, sunrise, early.

17:34.003 --> 17:35.961
That's seven hours on the road
before she called 9-1-1,

17:36.114 --> 17:37.113
which means she could be--

17:37.131 --> 17:39.057
Anywhere within
100 miles from here.

17:39.208 --> 17:40.207
Grace, I think we're
gonna hop in the car

17:40.285 --> 17:41.708
and head west looking for her.

17:41.803 --> 17:42.968
Uh, will you keep us updated?

17:43.121 --> 17:44.211
Yeah, I will.
I'll say a prayer, too.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.730
-Love you.
-Paul, come with us.

17:45.881 --> 17:46.806
We need your eyes.

17:46.882 --> 17:47.565
Okay, shouldn't we all go?

17:47.959 --> 17:48.841
No, no. Somebody's
gotta stay here

17:48.993 --> 17:49.883
in case she comes in that door.

17:49.961 --> 17:51.051
CARLOS REYES:
I'll call AFD,

17:51.071 --> 17:52.052
Highway Patrol,
Texas Rangers,

17:52.130 --> 17:53.387
see if they've heard anything.

17:53.464 --> 17:54.363
Alright.

17:56.634 --> 17:58.242
(groaning)

18:02.974 --> 18:05.666
Hey. Hey. Good hustle, Mouse.

18:08.663 --> 18:09.829
(pants)

18:09.981 --> 18:11.464
Are you still feeling okay?

18:11.999 --> 18:13.907
Yeah. You?

18:14.001 --> 18:15.510
-(vehicle approaching)
-Yeah.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.429
Hey.

18:22.585 --> 18:23.826
Hey!

18:23.845 --> 18:24.727
Hey!

18:25.513 --> 18:27.271
Stop! Hey!

18:27.423 --> 18:29.941
We need help.
(winces sharply)

18:30.017 --> 18:31.091
You alright?

18:31.111 --> 18:33.611
No. Th-There was an accident.

18:33.762 --> 18:34.670
Where's your vehicle?

18:34.689 --> 18:36.096
Down in-in the ravine.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.157
Looks like you hit your head
pretty good there.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.025
Yeah.

18:40.178 --> 18:41.510
The damn thing
won't stop leaking.

18:41.529 --> 18:43.955
I got some duct tape
in the back there.

18:44.031 --> 18:45.030
Probably do the trick.

18:45.183 --> 18:46.349
We-we should really just go.

18:46.367 --> 18:48.351
Nearest hospital's
40 miles away.

18:48.369 --> 18:50.611
You're liable to bleed out
before you get there.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.546
Come on.

18:54.134 --> 18:55.550
Drink some water.

18:56.636 --> 18:57.710
Thank you for stopping.

18:57.862 --> 18:59.712
My name's Rick.
What's yours?

18:59.806 --> 19:03.199
Marjan and, uh... Mouse

19:03.201 --> 19:04.642
RICK:
Kind of a nickname, huh?

19:07.129 --> 19:10.039
A square of this
over your eyebrow there

19:10.041 --> 19:13.225
should hold till we get you
to a professional.

19:13.302 --> 19:16.487
I'll dial 9-1-1.
Let 'em know we're on our way.

19:16.639 --> 19:17.229
Thank you, Rick.

19:17.398 --> 19:18.698
-Don't be--
-(gunshot)

An aggravated assault
two days ago in New Mexico.

Two days ago?
She never mentioned anything.

21:40.024 --> 21:42.133
The assailant

Please tell me
this guy's locked up.

31:12.145 --> 31:13.445
Look, I've--

31:13.521 --> 31:17.099
I've lost too much blood,
and I'm not gonna make it.

31:17.101 --> 31:19.525
But you have to.

31:19.603 --> 31:20.394
I'm so sorry.

31:20.396 --> 31:22.362
I don't care if you're sorry.

31:22.439 --> 31:25.465
You promised me we were gonna
get out of this together.

31:26.552 --> 31:27.634
Are you a liar?

31:28.629 --> 31:29.369
No.

31:29.537 --> 31:31.597
Then take my hand and get up.

31:36.787 --> 31:37.603
(Mouse grunts)

31:38.138 --> 31:39.971
(groans sharply)

31:40.048 --> 31:41.973
-(Mouse grunts)
-(Marjan groans)

31:42.050 --> 31:43.567
MOUSE: Come on.

31:43.718 --> 31:44.526
Come on.

31:45.796 --> 31:46.737
Yeah.

31:46.888 --> 31:48.447
(both panting)

31:52.560 --> 31:54.894
GRANT:
I know you were
in my stuff, friend.

31:54.914 --> 31:58.582
You know, you shouldn't touch
things that don't belong to you.

32:00.827 --> 32:02.961
You should've
stayed away from Kiley!

32:04.982 --> 32:06.906
After I'm done with you,

32:06.926 --> 32:08.759
I'm gonna find her.

32:08.910 --> 32:10.552
(yells) Fort Lauderdale?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.639
Isn't that what the bus said?

32:14.675 --> 32:16.324
You hear me?

32:16.343 --> 32:17.159
Hurry.

32:17.177 --> 32:19.019
-(groans)
-He's coming.

32:19.754 --> 32:21.846
I'm trying, kid. I'm--

32:21.923 --> 32:23.273
I'm trying.

32:25.002 --> 32:26.109
(Mouse grunts)

32:26.111 --> 32:27.402
MOUSE: This way.

32:31.433 --> 32:32.282
No.

32:33.935 --> 32:35.160
(groans)

32:36.863 --> 32:38.405
GRANT:
Damn, friend.

32:39.199 --> 32:41.683
How much blood you got in ya?

32:41.685 --> 32:44.586
Why don't you just let me
put you out of your misery?

32:46.023 --> 32:47.798
-What are we gonna do?
-(Marjan groans)

32:47.949 --> 32:49.708
I don't-- I don't know.

32:49.860 --> 32:51.343
I don't know.

32:57.034 --> 32:59.701
Alright, Grace,
we just passed mile marker 117.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.204
Okay, so Grant's Winnebago
should be on your right,

33:02.222 --> 33:03.313
just around this bend.

33:03.465 --> 33:05.315
Okay, we're going
around the bend.

33:05.542 --> 33:06.466
Definitely no Winnebago.

33:06.710 --> 33:09.361
What? You guys should be
right on top of it.

33:10.230 --> 33:11.379
JUDD:
What's that?

33:11.398 --> 33:13.198
It can't be a coincidence.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.417
Oh! Hey, y'all.

33:26.580 --> 33:27.820
Yeah, he's dead.

33:27.840 --> 33:28.913
He's got a gunshot wound.

33:29.008 --> 33:30.398
PAUL:
And, look,
we got drag marks

33:30.400 --> 33:32.234
going all the way back
to the driver's side door.

33:32.252 --> 33:35.161
Looks like someone
just wanted to get him
out of sight real quick.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.239
Uh, okay,
I'm gonna call this in.

33:37.257 --> 33:39.016
Guys, go back
and get us the radios.

33:39.167 --> 33:42.019
We're gonna split up
and find this Winnebago.

33:42.095 --> 33:43.478
And Marjan.

33:44.506 --> 33:45.397
And Marjan.

33:51.088 --> 33:52.011
(Marjan groans)

33:52.031 --> 33:53.772
I don't hear anything.

33:53.924 --> 33:55.032
Me either.

33:55.108 --> 33:56.849
Maybe he's gone.

33:56.927 --> 33:59.161
Okay. Okay.

34:00.781 --> 34:02.706
Let's go back that way.

34:02.783 --> 34:04.666
-(Marjan groans)
-(Mouse grunts)

34:09.548 --> 34:10.630
Hello, friend.

34:14.294 --> 34:15.969
Looks like that's it, friend.

34:20.634 --> 34:21.966
OWEN: Marjan!

34:22.043 --> 34:24.352
-(Marwani gasps)
-OWEN: Can you hear me?

34:24.955 --> 34:26.879
Marwani!

34:26.899 --> 34:28.623
(winces)

34:28.716 --> 34:29.641
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

34:29.793 --> 34:31.050
Don't make a sound.

34:31.128 --> 34:32.811
Don't make a sound.

34:32.963 --> 34:33.812
Or you're dead.

34:33.888 --> 34:35.313
I'm dead anyway.

34:35.465 --> 34:37.649
Yeah? Then I'll go do
your friend out there.

34:37.801 --> 34:38.817
PAUL: Marjan!

34:38.819 --> 34:39.743
It's Paul!

34:39.820 --> 34:40.893
Marjan!

34:40.913 --> 34:42.746
Holler back!

34:42.823 --> 34:44.623
Marwani, where you at?

34:45.809 --> 34:47.584
PAUL:
Marjan, can you hear me?

34:47.661 --> 34:49.661
OWEN: Marjan!

34:49.813 --> 34:51.505
Marjan, can you hear me?

34:57.337 --> 34:59.654
Hey, Cap, I got
a car in the ravine.

34:59.673 --> 35:00.913
Looks like it was
ran off the road.

35:00.991 --> 35:02.006
Any sign of the bike?

35:02.101 --> 35:03.433
PAUL (over radio):
<i> No. Checking the wreck.</i>

35:03.585 --> 35:05.519
Hey, y'all,
I found the Winnebago.

35:21.361 --> 35:23.102
Her name's
on the rental agreement.

35:23.196 --> 35:24.955
This is Marjan's car.

35:25.106 --> 35:26.272
Her car?
What happened to the bike?

35:26.350 --> 35:29.942
Nobody's home
but Marwani was definitely here.

35:30.036 --> 35:31.186
OWEN (over radio):
<i> You sure?</i>

35:31.204 --> 35:32.546
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.708
OWEN: Marjan!

35:36.860 --> 35:38.385
Are you out there?

35:40.639 --> 35:41.863
Marjan! Can you hear me?

35:41.865 --> 35:43.865
This can end now, Grant.

35:43.867 --> 35:45.809
Nobody else has to get hurt.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.126
GRANT:
Yeah, well, doesn't sound like

35:47.146 --> 35:49.721
your friends are leaving
anytime soon.

35:49.797 --> 35:51.389
Just let her go.

35:51.466 --> 35:52.524
Who?

35:53.560 --> 35:54.693
Kiley?

35:55.562 --> 35:56.227
No way.

35:56.304 --> 35:58.488
I'm gonna find Kiley.

35:58.565 --> 36:00.973
And then she's gonna
beg me to take her back

36:01.051 --> 36:02.884
before it's done.

36:02.886 --> 36:04.886
(laughs) Look at you.

36:04.905 --> 36:06.237
You can't even stand up.

36:06.314 --> 36:08.147
You know you're
gonna bleed out

36:08.225 --> 36:10.167
before they even
find us down here.

36:11.061 --> 36:12.151
You know what? You're right.

36:12.245 --> 36:14.913
We can end this
and they won't hear a thing.

36:15.065 --> 36:16.590
Don't even need
to waste another bullet.

36:21.013 --> 36:22.237
Turn around.

36:22.330 --> 36:23.680
(scoffs)
Why don't you
just give me that?

36:23.831 --> 36:25.073
I think you learned your lesson.

36:25.091 --> 36:26.975
-He's lying.
-I know.

36:27.686 --> 36:28.977
(gunshot)

36:32.691 --> 36:34.916
(groans, coughs)

36:34.918 --> 36:37.919
(Grant groaning,
screaming)

36:37.938 --> 36:40.346
-You guys hear that?
-Yeah, but where the hell
is it coming from?

36:40.365 --> 36:42.699
-MOUSE: We have to go.
-(Grant screaming)

36:43.593 --> 36:44.759
(grunts)

36:44.761 --> 36:46.778
It's okay. He's gone.

36:46.854 --> 36:47.871
We did it.

36:47.948 --> 36:49.614
No, we didn't.

36:49.691 --> 36:50.690
You have to get up.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.417
(groaning)

36:55.863 --> 36:57.339
Marjan!

36:58.108 --> 37:00.175
Marjan, we have to go.

37:02.629 --> 37:04.638
I see smoke 50 yards
east of the truck.

37:08.710 --> 37:10.602
MOUSE:
Marjan! Marjan!

37:11.897 --> 37:14.981
(dramatic music playing)

37:23.133 --> 37:24.908
-Marwani.
-Cap?

37:24.985 --> 37:26.134
Let me get you out of here.

37:26.194 --> 37:29.079
No. Take her first.
You have to take Mouse.

37:30.156 --> 37:32.398
You need to go with him.
You go with him.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.918
-OWEN: I got you.
-Cap! You can't leave her.

37:35.069 --> 37:36.753
It's okay, Marjan.

37:36.904 --> 37:38.646
I'm gonna be okay now.

37:38.648 --> 37:40.006
We both are.

37:48.583 --> 37:52.269
♪ ♪

38:03.765 --> 38:05.598
(softly) Mouse?

38:05.617 --> 38:08.159
(serene music playing)

38:23.168 --> 38:26.261
(indistinct PA chatter)

38:32.126 --> 38:33.959
Hey, sweetheart.
Sorry to wake you.

38:33.979 --> 38:36.054
I come bearing cronuts.

38:36.130 --> 38:37.129
-Ooh!
-CARLOS: Yes.

38:37.207 --> 38:38.873
Are these from
that place on Fifth?

38:38.892 --> 38:40.041
Babe, what, what is it called?

38:40.060 --> 38:41.651
Twiggies.

38:41.728 --> 38:42.727
Which you won't be

38:42.804 --> 38:44.303
if you have a few of those.

38:44.323 --> 38:46.138
I hope no one's
on a wedding diet.

38:46.158 --> 38:48.049
Oh, no, not today.
I'm starving.

38:48.068 --> 38:49.809
You're a lifesaver. Thank you.

38:49.886 --> 38:51.143
-(Grace giggles)
-Um, no, no, no.

38:51.221 --> 38:54.331
I hear that that title
belongs to all of y'all.

38:55.892 --> 38:57.725
How's Marjan doing?

38:57.727 --> 38:59.394
Um, she's good. She's stable.

38:59.412 --> 39:02.672
Last we heard, they were,
um, finishing up a surgery,

39:02.899 --> 39:03.898
cleaning out the bullet wound.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.175
Good. Other than that,
she's okay?

39:05.251 --> 39:08.086
Yeah, she got a concussion,

39:08.162 --> 39:10.088
two cracked ribs,
and some smoke inhalation.

39:10.240 --> 39:13.091
Mm-hmm. Nothing a little
R&R won't heal, though.

39:13.167 --> 39:15.910
Which is the last thing
she's gonna wanna hear.

39:15.929 --> 39:17.336
(chuckles) Right.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.522
How was Izzy's recital
last night?

39:19.674 --> 39:21.358
Oh, magical.

39:21.434 --> 39:24.343
For the first 15 minutes
that she was on stage.

39:24.363 --> 39:26.104
Then there were
the three and a half hours

39:26.180 --> 39:27.772
that followed, yeah.

39:27.849 --> 39:28.923
Babe, we gotta make sure

39:28.942 --> 39:30.683
Charlie stays away
from that ballet.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.260
-Yeah.
-I got news for you.

39:32.262 --> 39:33.853
Basketball camp isn't better.

39:33.947 --> 39:35.279
Well, it could be
that our daughter

39:35.356 --> 39:37.189
just don't got
no interests at all.

39:37.209 --> 39:38.190
-Good luck with that.
-GRACE RYDER: Mm-hmm.

39:38.268 --> 39:39.767
Oh, Captain, your timing

39:39.861 --> 39:41.026
is impeccable as always.

39:41.104 --> 39:42.270
Captain.

39:42.272 --> 39:44.297
Who's here
for Marjan Marwani?

39:45.533 --> 39:46.608
Huh. So many.

39:46.626 --> 39:48.885
I'm Dr. Cortes,
her vascular surgeon.

39:48.962 --> 39:50.703
The surgery was
a complete success.

39:50.722 --> 39:54.132
She's awake,
but still a little groggy
from the anesthesia.

39:54.284 --> 39:55.466
So can we go see her?

39:55.619 --> 39:56.726
Yes, but not all at once.

39:56.953 --> 39:59.211
We only allow two visitors
at a time on this floor,

39:59.231 --> 40:01.731
so you'll have to go in shifts.

40:01.808 --> 40:03.549
I'll let you sort it out.

40:03.568 --> 40:05.293
-Paul, why don't
you and I go first?
-Yeah.

40:05.295 --> 40:07.362
Wait, hey,
why you guys first?

40:08.965 --> 40:10.490
Fine. Just don't take too long.

40:13.561 --> 40:14.494
Knock, knock.

40:15.062 --> 40:16.746
Hey, guys.

40:16.898 --> 40:18.456
Hey, girl.

40:19.142 --> 40:20.083
MARJAN: Hi.

40:20.234 --> 40:21.826
You really picked a crazy way

40:21.920 --> 40:23.086
to spend your vacation.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.648
Next time, I'm gonna fly
and skip the drama.

40:26.650 --> 40:29.000
Yeah, well, there's a lot
of drama in the air, too.

40:29.076 --> 40:30.260
Trust me.

40:30.411 --> 40:31.744
Ah.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.388
So how you feeling?

40:33.765 --> 40:34.722
Froggy.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.225
Foggy.

40:38.161 --> 40:39.994
It's a lot of painkillers.

40:39.996 --> 40:42.755
So don't hold anything
I say against me.

40:42.832 --> 40:44.274
Don't worry, we won't.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.235
Thanks for saving my ass, Cap.

40:48.171 --> 40:50.947
We just gave your ass a ride.

40:51.024 --> 40:52.449
You saved it yourself.

40:53.343 --> 40:55.434
So you really sold the bike?

40:55.454 --> 40:56.844
Come on now, Cap.
Seriously?

40:56.863 --> 40:59.530
I promise it was
for a good cause.

40:59.607 --> 41:00.623
Oh, I have no doubt.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.684
But you didn't get $200 more?

41:02.686 --> 41:03.585
Uh-huh.

41:04.779 --> 41:06.796
They-they told me that Grant--

41:06.873 --> 41:08.298
Got what he deserved.

41:09.301 --> 41:11.083
What about
the older gentleman

41:11.194 --> 41:12.952
that pulled over to help us?

41:13.029 --> 41:15.346
He didn't make it.
I'm sorry.

41:17.124 --> 41:19.267
MARJAN:
God keep him.

41:20.386 --> 41:22.962
Wait, there-there,
there was another car.

41:23.039 --> 41:25.206
The station wagon...

41:25.225 --> 41:27.800
it swerved and there was
a family in it, Cap.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.736
Mm-mm. There was no other car.

41:32.048 --> 41:32.805
Are you sure?

41:32.882 --> 41:35.049
Oh, yeah, we're-we're sure.

41:35.051 --> 41:37.142
This concussion is no joke.

41:37.220 --> 41:38.995
Yeah, you were pretty out of it
when we found you.

41:39.146 --> 41:41.498
You thought you were
talking to somebody.

41:42.501 --> 41:43.500
-Really?
-Yeah.

41:43.651 --> 41:45.251
Somebody named Mouse.

41:46.505 --> 41:47.170
No kidding.

41:47.339 --> 41:49.255
That mean something to you?

41:50.400 --> 41:51.065
Yeah.

41:51.067 --> 41:51.916
(footsteps approaching)

41:52.010 --> 41:53.234
Yeah, it does. Wow, I--

41:53.236 --> 41:54.177
NURSE:
These came for you.

41:54.328 --> 41:56.128
Is it okay if I put them
by the bed?

41:56.239 --> 41:58.264
MARJAN:
That'd be great, thank you.

42:00.744 --> 42:02.018
How fancy.

42:02.095 --> 42:03.436
Who are they from?

42:09.252 --> 42:11.194
-Marjan?
-GIRL: Mom.

42:11.530 --> 42:13.087
Dad.

42:13.106 --> 42:14.179
We were so worried.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.849
Joey... and his parents,

42:16.926 --> 42:18.493
I couldn't save them.

42:19.279 --> 42:22.855
I tried, but nobody came.

42:22.932 --> 42:24.098
I know.

42:24.117 --> 42:25.875
My baby, I know.

42:26.027 --> 42:28.603
But you survived.

42:28.696 --> 42:30.338
I didn't think I would.

42:31.107 --> 42:32.715
I never felt so alone.

42:32.867 --> 42:35.777
Always remember...

42:35.779 --> 42:37.461
no matter what happens,

42:37.614 --> 42:41.391
with Allah,
you're never alone.

42:41.893 --> 42:43.393
Understand?

42:44.045 --> 42:45.728
Yes, Mom.

42:45.805 --> 42:48.231
We love you so much, Marjan.

42:50.235 --> 42:52.569
Our sweet little mouse.
