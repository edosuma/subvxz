00:03.400 --> 00:05.400
Grandma's going through one of
her good spells right now.

00:05.475 --> 00:06.567
So that's-- that's good.

00:06.797 --> 00:10.500
But I keep hearing that like they're
trying to bring in this Katrina refugee.

00:10.716 --> 00:12.211
This quarterback
from New Orleans.

00:12.467 --> 00:14.402
We got ourselves
a quarterback, coach.

00:17.642 --> 00:18.617
Welcome aboard, son.

00:18.731 --> 00:21.300
If I get in that car right now,
I'm never coming back. Do you understand?

00:21.433 --> 00:22.083
I get it.

00:22.968 --> 00:24.290
My legs are never
gonna get better!

00:24.637 --> 00:25.500
Football, over.

00:25.863 --> 00:27.405
You and me, we're not
getting married.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.117
Don't say that, Jason.

00:29.581 --> 00:30.657
Lyla, get out!

00:30.769 --> 00:31.963
What is wrong with you?

00:32.284 --> 00:35.200
Jason is in the hospital
and you won't even go and see him.

00:35.677 --> 00:37.043
Why don't you go and see him?

00:38.328 --> 00:40.602
He's never gonna walk again.

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074

<i>Oh, oh--that is nasty.</i>

01:07.397 --> 01:08.411
God help me.
That's disgusting!

01:08.696 --> 01:09.503
Hey, Julie.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.132
You finally came
to one of our parties.

01:12.278 --> 01:12.992
Yeah.

01:13.277 --> 01:14.082
And if you'll excuse me,

01:14.168 --> 01:16.041
I'm gonna go see if vomit
comes out of suede.

01:18.945 --> 01:19.823
Hey, good luck.

01:27.876 --> 01:31.501
Tim Riggins has been gawking
at us all night.

01:31.927 --> 01:32.872
I don't think he's--

01:33.028 --> 01:35.342
I always suspected
he was into me.

01:35.476 --> 01:35.772
Oh...

01:35.897 --> 01:40.801
Word on the street
is he totally dumped Tyra.

01:47.886 --> 01:48.563
<i>What's up, man?</i>

01:49.286 --> 01:50.200
<i>What up, Voodoo?</i>

01:50.535 --> 01:51.641
<i>Voodoo!</i>

01:55.656 --> 01:57.571
Have you Googled that guy?

01:58.368 --> 01:58.741
What?

01:58.915 --> 02:00.401
He won State last year
in Louisiana.

02:00.518 --> 02:02.272
Broke like five school records.

02:02.616 --> 02:03.953
You're history, Saracen.

02:04.986 --> 02:07.281
But you and your girlfriend
have a nice night.

02:07.656 --> 02:09.132
He's a nice guy.

02:09.257 --> 02:10.622
Yeah, he's the best.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.301
Hey, who changed my tune?

02:26.575 --> 02:27.312
Hey, Doo-Doo.

02:28.286 --> 02:30.073
What the hell you think
you're doing, man?

02:30.617 --> 02:31.563
Seriously, son.

02:31.807 --> 02:33.780
You gotta climb
some trees, brother.

02:34.096 --> 02:35.323
Touch something.

02:38.528 --> 02:40.143
You ever touch me again...

02:40.607 --> 02:42.592
I'll break your fingers.

Friday Night Lights

03:40.347 --> 03:40.981
All right, let's go!

03:44.007 --> 03:45.160
<i>Let's do it, let's do it!</i>

03:47.477 --> 03:49.530
<i>Let's do it, let's do it!</i>

03:51.636 --> 03:53.532
<i>Now, everybody knows
that the Dillon Panthers</i>

03:53.705 --> 03:57.380
<i>and the Arnett Mead Tigers have
been rivals for a long time.</i>

03:57.777 --> 04:00.581
<i>So we are looking forward
to another great football game.</i>

04:00.956 --> 04:03.012
<i>And to make it
even more interesting,</i>

04:03.238 --> 04:04.820
<i>we've got a little
wager going here.</i>

04:04.997 --> 04:07.040
<i>Winner takes all.
Isn't that right, Mayor?</i>

04:07.497 --> 04:09.713
<i>"All" being Sally here.</i>

04:10.597 --> 04:13.461
<i>Now, Sally is mine.
My prize heifer.</i>

04:14.706 --> 04:18.002
Um, honey, when are you
gonna be able to get home on Friday,

04:18.108 --> 04:19.500
- what time?
- Friday?

04:19.528 --> 04:21.341
We've got a scrimmage,
so I don't know.

04:21.524 --> 04:22.652
It'll end when it ends.

04:29.038 --> 04:29.912
I'll be in the car.

04:31.765 --> 04:32.211
Hey!

04:34.028 --> 04:34.940
What?
What did I do now?

04:35.198 --> 04:38.302
Honey, Friday is her dance recital.
You know that.

04:38.435 --> 04:39.160
Damn. I--I know.

04:39.728 --> 04:41.100
And you know
they plan those things

04:41.198 --> 04:43.802
on bye weeks just so
maybe somebody'll show up.

04:43.856 --> 04:44.173
I understand that.

04:44.306 --> 04:47.301
- I just messed up the dates a bit.
- All right, I love you. Bye.

04:47.515 --> 04:49.503
- Tell Julie--
- I'll tell her.

04:49.608 --> 04:50.802
I don't want her mad at me.

04:53.127 --> 04:54.381
One, two, three.

04:56.397 --> 04:57.522
There you go.

05:01.685 --> 05:03.711
Hey, when you're done
putting the newbie

05:03.827 --> 05:05.671
in that gay wheelchair
let me know.

05:05.908 --> 05:07.543
You are talking
to a gay man, Herc.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.220
I don't mean "gay"
as in "homosexual".

05:09.516 --> 05:10.543
I mean "gay"
as in "retarded."

05:10.736 --> 05:12.171
Maybe I have
a retarded son.

05:12.247 --> 05:13.370
Is he gay?

05:13.655 --> 05:14.591
I'm joking.

05:14.907 --> 05:17.201
Though there can be a genetic
component to homosexuality.

05:17.317 --> 05:18.731
Watch the Discovery Channel, Phil.

05:19.166 --> 05:20.202
When you're done,

05:20.308 --> 05:22.373
the bench press on the floor gym
is busted again.

05:22.476 --> 05:24.201
I need a walkie
to help me fix it.

05:24.307 --> 05:25.520
Welcome to paradise, kid.

05:28.875 --> 05:29.512
Who the hell was that?

05:31.325 --> 05:32.332
Your roommate.

05:52.707 --> 05:53.501
Rivalry.

05:55.807 --> 05:56.711
Tradition.

05:59.828 --> 06:02.803
Bring that knee up to your chest
as far up as it'll...

06:03.645 --> 06:06.902
Okay, Grandma, I'm going to school
to talk to Dad.

06:07.107 --> 06:08.662
Any messages
you want me to give him?

06:08.855 --> 06:09.501
Mmm.
Thank you, honey.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.843
Oh, is he coming over
for dinner tonight?

06:13.755 --> 06:15.612
Um, I'll ask him.

06:18.605 --> 06:20.180
Be sure he's taking
his vitamins.

06:22.727 --> 06:23.360
I will.

06:25.038 --> 06:26.551
You be sure to take
your pills, okay?

06:26.745 --> 06:28.562
- I love you.
- Mm-hmm, I love you too.

06:28.796 --> 06:30.582
- Have a good day.
- All right, sweetie.

06:36.737 --> 06:37.630
<i>Hey, boy, how you doing?</i>

06:38.357 --> 06:40.201
Doing good. I'm doing good.
How you doing?

06:40.447 --> 06:41.662
<i>Well, I'm hanging in here, man.</i>

06:41.908 --> 06:42.992
Pretty hot.

06:43.595 --> 06:44.183
Yeah.

06:44.376 --> 06:45.670
<i>You get to play this week?</i>

06:45.897 --> 06:46.951
I did. I started.

06:47.338 --> 06:47.790
<i>Very good.</i>

06:47.976 --> 06:50.200
Yeah, it was my first start.
We didn't win, but--

06:50.475 --> 06:52.261
<i>Oh, that's all right.
You got to start, though.</i>

06:52.377 --> 06:54.291
I threw pretty well.
I hit my receivers pretty well.

06:54.687 --> 06:57.203
So what about next week?
You gonna start again?

06:58.147 --> 06:58.910
Well, I--

06:59.575 --> 07:01.612
We'll have to see, 'cause...

07:02.055 --> 07:03.611
we got--we got
this new quarterback.

07:03.925 --> 07:06.390
He's supposedly, like,
this big star from Louisiana.

07:06.805 --> 07:07.353
Is that right?

07:07.656 --> 07:11.400
Yeah, but we'll just have to wait
and see what Coach decides. You know, so...

07:11.556 --> 07:14.000
Well, I guess it takes
the pressure off, don't it?

07:16.396 --> 07:18.072
Yeah. Yeah, Dad.

07:21.017 --> 07:21.903
I guess.

07:24.376 --> 07:26.740
Jason, try and take
a bite of food, okay?

07:27.757 --> 07:28.943
I'm really not hungry.

07:29.327 --> 07:30.330
That's all right.

07:30.938 --> 07:32.293
I just want you
to try to use your hands.

07:32.587 --> 07:35.783
Well, I can't...
use my hands, all right?

07:36.335 --> 07:37.551
Yeah, Jason, you can.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.002
You know, you're gonna get
the use of your hands back.

07:41.377 --> 07:43.322
Not everybody around here
can say that,

07:43.468 --> 07:44.770
so you're gonna
have to work at it.

07:45.686 --> 07:46.923
And you're gonna have to try.

07:47.437 --> 07:49.032
I'm really feeling
tired right now,

07:49.145 --> 07:50.403
and I'd like to lay down.

07:50.606 --> 07:52.211
Jason, I know you're tired.

07:53.286 --> 07:53.950
But if you work at it,

07:54.118 --> 07:56.410
you're gonna get to be
able to do almost everything

07:56.503 --> 07:58.205
that you were able to do
before your accident.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.667
Look, I'm not hungry,
and I'm tired,

08:00.981 --> 08:01.987
and I'd just like
to lay down.

08:02.289 --> 08:03.102
He said he's tired.

08:03.798 --> 08:04.763
Why don't you let him rest?

08:14.136 --> 08:15.032
Hey, babe.

08:16.016 --> 08:16.732
Hey.

08:19.857 --> 08:22.001
Listen, I know you'll do it
when you're ready, Jason, but

08:22.107 --> 08:23.402
you do have to eat.

08:24.246 --> 08:26.332
All right?
Let me help you.

08:28.288 --> 08:30.823
Come on.
Come on, babe.

08:34.607 --> 08:35.332
There you go.

08:37.118 --> 08:38.732
Hey, y'all.
This is Corey.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.230
Ah, the girlfriend.

08:43.927 --> 08:44.740
Hi.

08:46.365 --> 08:48.502
It's all right.
You can shake it. I won't bite.

08:48.725 --> 08:50.323
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

08:51.157 --> 08:52.753
Hey, Herc, you want
to get out of my food?

08:52.816 --> 08:53.513
Excuse me.

08:54.317 --> 08:54.911
Don't worry.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.090
He ain't gonna be
eating any of it soon.

09:00.085 --> 09:01.820
Yo, Corey,
we're out of here.

09:03.177 --> 09:03.861
Later on, Sparky.

09:05.415 --> 09:06.492
I've gotta get out of this room.

09:08.767 --> 09:11.110
<i>One, two, three, four.</i>

09:12.705 --> 09:13.563
<i>One, track, two.</i>

09:14.736 --> 09:15.791
<i>Around.</i>

09:16.915 --> 09:17.551
<i>Sharp. Eight.</i>

09:18.418 --> 09:22.501
<i>And big. Hit, hit, hit!
Big, big again. Bigger.</i>

09:22.967 --> 09:24.561
<i>Boom! And hit, hit, hit.</i>

09:24.845 --> 09:25.961
<i>In, out, in,out.</i>

09:26.128 --> 09:26.960
<i>Hit.</i>

09:28.926 --> 09:30.053
<i> Good. Good job, y'all.
</i>

09:36.697 --> 09:37.871
Let's go.
Bring it in, get in here.

09:38.866 --> 09:40.163
Come on, let's hustle up now.

09:51.828 --> 09:52.711
I gotta tell y'all something.

09:53.168 --> 09:55.180
I'm pissed at these boys
from Arnett Mead.

09:55.866 --> 09:56.961
I know you're pissed, too,

09:57.138 --> 09:58.721
but let's get one thing
straight right now.

09:59.448 --> 10:00.430
This ends here.

10:01.026 --> 10:04.401
There's not gonna be any retaliation.
There's gonna be no getting back.

10:04.698 --> 10:06.373
Rivalry week ends now.

10:06.916 --> 10:07.841
Tell you what we are gonna do.

10:08.736 --> 10:12.503
We're gonna take this energy we have,
and we're gonna take this anger that we have

10:12.955 --> 10:16.800
and we are gonna use it to kick their ass
where it counts... on the field.

10:17.175 --> 10:18.783
- Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

10:19.126 --> 10:20.741
- Who are we?
- Dillon Panthers!

10:21.016 --> 10:22.703
- Who are we?
- Dillon Panthers!

10:22.945 --> 10:24.181
All right, let's have
a good practice now.

10:26.315 --> 10:27.763
Hey, where's Voodoo?

10:28.165 --> 10:29.421
I don't know, Saracen.

10:29.808 --> 10:31.130
He's probably jerking around

10:31.248 --> 10:33.242
in front of a full-length
mirror right now.

10:38.297 --> 10:39.060
<i>Get off the ball.</i>

10:39.175 --> 10:40.300
<i>Get your heads in the game, boys,</i>

10:40.378 --> 10:41.233
<i>Get your heads in the game!</i>

10:42.667 --> 10:44.083
<i> Beware. Watch 'em coming in.</i>

10:44.168 --> 10:45.552
<i>29!</i>

10:46.158 --> 10:46.902
29!

10:47.847 --> 10:48.160
Hut!

10:49.377 --> 10:49.931
Get up there!

10:57.558 --> 10:58.082
Hey.

11:01.297 --> 11:02.840
<i>Let's go.
Bring it in, bring it in.</i>

11:09.546 --> 11:10.293
H ey.

11:11.587 --> 11:12.713
Practice starts at 4:00.

11:12.817 --> 11:14.993
I want you here at 4:00.
You hear me?

11:17.238 --> 11:17.810
Hey!

11:20.938 --> 11:21.971
You hear what I said?

11:28.367 --> 11:29.073
I hate him.

11:30.495 --> 11:30.950
Hate him.

11:31.096 --> 11:32.043
<i>All right,
let's huddle up, guys.</i>

11:32.126 --> 11:32.772
<i>Bring it in.</i>

11:34.687 --> 11:36.683
All right, let's go, baby.
Get off the ball now.

11:37.028 --> 11:37.440
<i>Let's go.</i>

11:40.875 --> 11:43.760
Set! Red eight!
Red eight!

11:44.995 --> 11:45.412
Hut!

11:55.208 --> 11:57.101
Pretty good.

12:13.937 --> 12:14.581
<i>There it is.</i>

12:14.787 --> 12:15.751
<i>There it is, it worked.</i>

12:16.936 --> 12:18.093
<i>He just looks good every time.</i>

12:19.116 --> 12:19.980
Good play.
Hustle back.

12:21.457 --> 12:22.041
<i>Good play.
Voodoo, Voodoo.</i>

12:22.316 --> 12:24.573
- Let's go!
- Looked good, Coach.

12:25.205 --> 12:26.361
He's doing something

12:26.475 --> 12:28.123
with that chance
you gave him, isn't he?

12:29.288 --> 12:30.761
I love this boy.

12:31.535 --> 12:33.870
Got my Voodoo working.

12:34.226 --> 12:36.160
Got that Voodoo working.

12:41.825 --> 12:43.545
Ray, what were you thinking all those days...

12:43.545 --> 12:45.541
when you were entraped 
inside the Superdome,

12:45.915 --> 12:47.611
not knowing if you were
gonna live or die?

12:47.998 --> 12:49.652
God wasn't gonna let me die.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.750
He told me to war up,
dance with fear.

12:52.877 --> 12:53.573
Now you see,

12:53.988 --> 12:56.283
I knew that the heavens
had opened up

12:56.316 --> 12:58.700
when this young man
landed here in Dillon

12:59.038 --> 13:01.712
after his family had been
through that devastation

13:01.857 --> 13:03.071
with Hurricane Katrina.

13:03.136 --> 13:04.691
I mean, I just
thought to myself,

13:04.978 --> 13:08.300
"This just might be our
new starting quarterback."

13:08.397 --> 13:11.771
Now are you saying that Coach Taylor's
given the nod to Voodoo

13:11.868 --> 13:13.642
to start next Friday
against the Tigers?

13:13.787 --> 13:15.720
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That's not my department.

13:15.845 --> 13:18.501
<i>You'll have to talk to
Coach Taylor about that one.</i>

13:19.586 --> 13:22.093
What are you pounding
around about?

13:22.606 --> 13:24.351
Nothing.
It's just this guy.

13:25.327 --> 13:26.762
- Voodoo?
- Well...

13:27.196 --> 13:29.422
Don't let Voodoo get
into your mind, babe.

13:29.507 --> 13:32.821
I'm not, I just got
a bad feeling about this.

13:32.938 --> 13:34.372
Well, you should play
Matt Saracen.

13:34.557 --> 13:35.570
Wish I could play
Matt Saracen,

13:35.695 --> 13:36.570
- but I can't play Matt Saracen
- Why not?

13:36.878 --> 13:39.800
'cause Matt Saracen's
self-destructing on the field.

13:39.947 --> 13:41.602
Are we having
some kind of party?

13:41.696 --> 13:42.952
Hey, monkey noodle,
come here.

13:43.116 --> 13:45.070
- How you doing?
- What did you say, sweetie?

13:45.528 --> 13:46.900
Some football party?

13:47.636 --> 13:51.300
'Cause Lois told me about this party,
and she's definitely the last person

13:51.377 --> 13:54.250
in the entire state of Texas
to find out about anything.

13:54.788 --> 13:56.890
That sounds just like a vicious rumor to me.

13:57.056 --> 13:58.321
I mean, I can't imagine
we'd be having

13:58.488 --> 13:59.810
any kind of football party.

13:59.915 --> 14:02.051
I mean, 'cause if we were having
some kind of a football party,

14:02.125 --> 14:04.623
that would involve food,
and drink,

14:04.735 --> 14:06.451
and a lot of advance notice.

14:06.578 --> 14:08.771
It's a weekend rivalry.
I didn't know anything about it.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.921
It's a tradition.
Everyone comes over to the coach's house.

14:11.006 --> 14:13.033
- When is this?
- A couple days.

14:13.128 --> 14:15.252
You mean, like,
Thursday couple days?

14:15.546 --> 14:17.330
All right, for how many
people, sweetie?

14:17.658 --> 14:18.633
Just the team.

14:18.708 --> 14:20.403
- Just the team.
Well, I mean, it'll be the team,

14:20.565 --> 14:22.802
and it'll probably be
a few others.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.920
- How many people?
- I'll help. It'll be fine.

14:25.195 --> 14:26.353
It's gonna be a lot of fun.

14:32.726 --> 14:33.701
- Grandma?
- Hmm?

14:35.698 --> 14:37.301
Did you forget to take
your pills yesterday?

14:37.585 --> 14:38.890
No, I took 'em.

14:39.498 --> 14:42.722
Well, then how come they're sitting
right here where I left 'em?

14:42.858 --> 14:44.080
'Cause you're mistaken.

14:44.155 --> 14:46.950
I took 'em just like I always do.
You might've made a mistake.

14:47.287 --> 14:47.892
Ok.

14:49.145 --> 14:50.343
Well, how about, um--

14:51.746 --> 14:54.290
Would you mind maybe today
taking 'em while I'm standing here?

14:57.748 --> 14:59.880
Matthew, give me those pills.

15:00.076 --> 15:01.061
Give me that juice.

15:01.516 --> 15:03.043
Don't take your eyes off my face.

15:03.558 --> 15:06.550
Now watch.
Pills.

15:09.636 --> 15:10.690
Juice.

15:11.005 --> 15:11.540
Ok.

15:11.696 --> 15:13.531
- Now you go to school.
- Yes, ma'am.

15:13.798 --> 15:16.272
Hey, hey, I saw that
game tape of yours again,

15:16.487 --> 15:18.402
and I know what your problem
is--it's your feet.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.932
Oh, yeah?
What's wrong with my feet?

15:20.076 --> 15:22.422
They're slow.
Slower than molasses.

15:22.887 --> 15:24.052
Need to move 'em faster.

15:24.335 --> 15:26.081
- All right.
- Let me see you.

15:28.567 --> 15:29.442
I'll work on that.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.371
Hey, we need to talk.

15:48.565 --> 15:50.163
I've been having these feelings.

15:50.745 --> 15:52.763
Like, a flood of feelings.

15:52.917 --> 15:53.521
Me too.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.140
For Jason, Tim.

15:55.946 --> 15:57.151
What happened with us

15:57.337 --> 15:59.222
came from all these
feelings about Jason

15:59.398 --> 16:01.500
and what he's going through.

16:01.685 --> 16:04.001
I know it doesn't make a lot of sense,
but do you understand?

16:04.535 --> 16:04.940
Yeah.

16:05.756 --> 16:06.643
What I'm saying is,

16:06.776 --> 16:09.032
I don't feel aything for you, okay?

16:09.956 --> 16:12.752
That wasn't even me that night.
That was...

16:13.557 --> 16:15.382
I don't even know who that was.

16:15.487 --> 16:17.841
But it will never happen again.

16:18.228 --> 16:19.493
No one can ever know about it,

16:19.578 --> 16:20.831
and it meant nothing.

16:21.217 --> 16:22.282
Do you understand me, Tim?

16:22.855 --> 16:23.451
Yeah.

16:26.006 --> 16:27.600
I hate myself for the other night.

16:27.788 --> 16:30.082
I just hope I don't go
straight to hell.

16:30.586 --> 16:31.531
I really do.

16:40.436 --> 16:41.222
<i>Heads up.</i>

16:41.415 --> 16:42.080
<i>Let's go, linemen!</i>

16:44.315 --> 16:45.782
<i>Beware, watch 'em coming in.</i>

16:46.235 --> 16:48.912
<i>- Get off the ball, linemen.
- Let's go, fire off.</i>

16:49.447 --> 16:52.170
<i>Saracen, concentrate.
Get your heads in the game!</i>

16:52.757 --> 16:53.190
Hut!

16:54.588 --> 16:55.773
<i>For God's sakes, Matt!</i>

16:56.688 --> 16:58.123
<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

17:05.426 --> 17:06.852
Show me your right hand.

17:08.257 --> 17:09.640
Show me your left hand.

17:10.076 --> 17:12.582
Well, that's a relief, he knows
his right from his left.

17:12.646 --> 17:13.530
<i>Brush with your right,
wipe with your left.</i>

17:13.605 --> 17:14.222
Listen to me.

17:14.416 --> 17:16.550
90% of this game
is between the ears, son.

17:16.627 --> 17:19.300
Mental errors are unacceptable.
You got that?

17:19.757 --> 17:20.713
Play smart.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.402
Mom says you're supposed to give me
a head count for the party.

17:24.507 --> 17:26.651
- Oh, hey, babe.
- Hey, Reyes, get your head out of your ass

17:26.737 --> 17:27.531
while you're at it.

17:27.645 --> 17:29.322
Nice, Dad.
That was very elegant.

17:29.456 --> 17:30.271
Head count?

17:30.505 --> 17:30.791
Hut!

17:33.176 --> 17:33.972
<i>There you go, there you go!</i>

17:34.066 --> 17:36.253
You almost look like
you know what you're doing.

17:37.197 --> 17:37.981
Fifty-ish.

17:38.488 --> 17:41.222
Is that more like 50
or more like 100?

17:41.537 --> 17:42.723
60, say 60.

17:43.045 --> 17:44.282
- All right.
- All right.

17:44.315 --> 17:46.050
- Love you, Daddy.
- I love you, too, baby.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.701
You have a good day.
Hey, hey!

17:48.295 --> 17:50.362
- Sixty-ish.
- Right.

17:51.566 --> 17:53.473
Yeah, sixty-ish.
That's good.

17:53.987 --> 17:54.532
Play!

17:55.718 --> 17:57.162
Son, you're a mess out there.

17:58.297 --> 17:58.803
Yes, sir.

17:58.986 --> 18:00.421
You need to get
more focused, son.

18:01.398 --> 18:01.913
Yes, sir.

18:03.086 --> 18:04.930
Now I know what's distracting you.

18:05.447 --> 18:06.611
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

18:07.288 --> 18:08.393
And I'm gonna
tell you something.

18:08.476 --> 18:09.782
You forget about Voodoo.
You understand me?

18:09.878 --> 18:11.403
This is within your reach.

18:11.617 --> 18:13.181
But not if you don't
attack the opportunity.

18:13.276 --> 18:16.400
I mean, attack the opportunity
every day, every practice.

18:17.496 --> 18:17.981
Yeah.

18:19.287 --> 18:20.391
You got a girlfriend?

18:20.867 --> 18:22.542
Uh, no, sir.

18:23.258 --> 18:25.061
Do you have someone
you're interested in?

18:25.626 --> 18:28.983
- Uh...sort of.
- Sort of?

18:29.306 --> 18:30.880
Well, forget about sort of.
You know what?

18:31.065 --> 18:32.692
Take her out.
You understand me?

18:33.118 --> 18:34.830
- Sir?
- Movies, dinner.

18:34.898 --> 18:35.842
Get her in the backseat
of your car.

18:35.976 --> 18:37.251
I don't care.
Whatever.

18:37.457 --> 18:38.910
But I'm telling you, you need
to get loose out there.

18:39.028 --> 18:40.442
You're wound up tighter
than a rubber band, son.

18:40.966 --> 18:41.460
Yes, sir.

18:42.597 --> 18:43.143
Good.

18:44.687 --> 18:49.001
So tomorrow, you come to practice
loose and focused.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.470
- Loose and focused.
- Yes, sir.

18:55.068 --> 18:55.963
Get out of here.

18:56.695 --> 18:59.951
Y-yes, sir, sorry.
Thanks, Coach.

19:00.828 --> 19:01.452
You're welcome.

19:11.636 --> 19:12.552
Hey, Grandma.

19:17.867 --> 19:18.550
Grandma?

19:24.507 --> 19:25.151
Grandma?

19:27.745 --> 19:28.503
Grandma?

19:31.945 --> 19:33.081
Oh, hey, Mrs. Johnson.

19:33.275 --> 19:34.330
I'm really sorry to bother you.

19:34.438 --> 19:35.271
Have you seen my grandmother?

19:35.655 --> 19:36.321
No.

19:36.996 --> 19:38.493
Matt, is everything okay?

19:39.176 --> 19:41.971
Uh, yeah, I'm sure
everything's fine.

19:42.115 --> 19:42.913
Thanks.
I'm really sorry.

19:43.285 --> 19:45.420
- I'm sorry I woke you.
- Well, let me know.

19:45.508 --> 19:45.992
I will.

19:52.596 --> 19:53.882
How many do you want, like, seven?

19:54.568 --> 19:55.060
I don't know.

19:55.168 --> 19:57.101
I think I've got enough,
sweetie, of the ribs.

19:57.186 --> 19:58.830
All right, let's go.
Come on, come on.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.623
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey, Mrs. Taylor.

20:02.806 --> 20:05.253
Got a big pile
for you here today.

20:06.328 --> 20:08.041
Oh, honey, did we get onions?

20:08.327 --> 20:09.793
I don't know, that was
on your part of the list.

20:09.895 --> 20:11.451
Well, I can't remember
if I got 'em.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.152
Can you see 'em?
Are they over there?

20:13.987 --> 20:15.762
- Just will you please--
- I'm just gonna go get some more.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.821
Will you please?
Thank you. I appreciate that.

20:17.897 --> 20:18.812
You're welcome.

20:19.807 --> 20:21.132
Put the gum in there, too.

20:22.376 --> 20:24.751
Now, if it's all right
with you...

20:24.867 --> 20:26.481
- Hey!
- Hey!

20:26.748 --> 20:28.702
Looks like rivalry week team
dinner at the coach's house.

20:28.738 --> 20:29.631
- That's right.
- Wow.

20:30.058 --> 20:31.203
Anything I can bring?

20:31.557 --> 20:34.281
Oh, no, I think
I've got it under control.

20:34.376 --> 20:35.100
Thank you, sweetie.

20:35.386 --> 20:36.880
Well, we'll see you there.

20:37.058 --> 20:40.103
Okay. Oh, are y'all coming?
Are the parents coming?

20:40.225 --> 20:43.023
- Oh, we wouldn't miss it.
- Oh, great.

20:43.127 --> 20:45.213
- Go Panthers!
- Okay, see you then.

20:45.757 --> 20:46.611
- Bye!
- Bye!

21:07.435 --> 21:10.182
Wh--what happened?
What happened?

21:10.336 --> 21:11.591
- Matt Saracen?
- Yeah.

21:12.698 --> 21:13.982
Looks like she wandered
into a neighbor's house

21:14.198 --> 21:14.951
around the block.

21:15.166 --> 21:17.302
They came home
and found her taking a bath.

21:17.546 --> 21:19.613
- She's fine?
- Fine. She's all right.

21:19.725 --> 21:20.740
Grandma, are you all right?

21:21.606 --> 21:22.060
Matt.

21:25.358 --> 21:26.232
I'm sorry.

21:26.877 --> 21:27.611
Don't be sorry.

21:28.607 --> 21:29.291
I'm so sorry.

21:34.488 --> 21:36.480
Let's go in.
Don't let anybody see me.

21:36.865 --> 21:37.352
Okay.

21:38.578 --> 21:40.400
It's all right, you're home now.
You're home.

21:41.555 --> 21:42.173
It's okay.

21:43.807 --> 21:45.533
Let's go inside.
It's okay.

21:51.026 --> 21:52.990
Well, they said it's dementia.

21:53.516 --> 21:54.531
<i>But she's okay now.</i>

21:54.908 --> 21:57.221
Well, yeah, I guess.

21:57.956 --> 21:58.392
<i>Good.</i>

21:58.616 --> 22:01.401
<i>Look, son, you're just gonna
have to hold down the fort.</i>

22:01.547 --> 22:02.410
<i>I've got my hands full here, Matt.</i>

22:03.535 --> 22:06.451
Yeah, well, I'm fine.
She's--

22:09.156 --> 22:09.721
She's fine.

22:09.857 --> 22:11.641
She's--she's just Grandma,
you know?

22:21.907 --> 22:25.933
Man, I shouldn't be around here
too much longer anyway.

22:29.787 --> 22:32.500
I just re-injured myself.
Here for a little tune up.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.582
Another couple weeks,
I should be getting out of here.

22:35.985 --> 22:38.521
You, you're here for quite some time.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.503
I hope you get better real soon.

22:41.868 --> 22:42.872
Lord have mercy.

22:42.925 --> 22:44.533
Where have you been
all my life?

22:49.127 --> 22:49.721
Hey.

22:50.715 --> 22:51.311
Tyra.

22:52.415 --> 22:53.143
Um...

22:55.448 --> 22:56.122
Look...

22:57.625 --> 22:59.573
I know we were never
close buddies.

23:00.126 --> 23:02.272
And I can only imagine
the load of fake crap

23:02.335 --> 23:03.551
that you've had to put up
with from people

23:03.628 --> 23:04.463
you hardly even know,

23:04.797 --> 23:07.461
and I am so not doing that.

23:08.487 --> 23:14.451
I just, um...I came by to tell you how sorry
I am that Tim hasn't been in to see you.

23:15.126 --> 23:16.452
He wants to.

23:16.548 --> 23:18.630
Although, you know,
we won't admit it.

23:18.985 --> 23:20.653
But he just can't do it.

23:21.345 --> 23:22.420
Yeah, why is that?

23:23.637 --> 23:24.802
He's scared.

23:25.407 --> 23:26.430
Oh, he's scared?

23:28.595 --> 23:29.950
Yeah, well, that's Tim for you.

23:32.476 --> 23:33.502
It sure is.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.242
- Well...
- Well...

23:39.495 --> 23:40.393
Thanks for coming.

23:41.267 --> 23:42.253
Yeah, yeah.

23:44.168 --> 23:46.600
And you tell Tim whenever
he's ready he can come on by.

23:47.745 --> 23:48.270
Jason...

23:50.585 --> 23:51.332
I'm really sorry.

23:54.077 --> 23:55.070
No, I mean...

23:57.286 --> 24:00.182
Something like this shouldn't happen
to a good person like you.

24:09.086 --> 24:11.081
- Thank you.
- Bye.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.283
Who in the hell was that?

24:16.896 --> 24:17.593
That's Tyra.

24:20.548 --> 24:21.240
Hey! Sparky.

24:23.486 --> 24:24.592
Come on, line, get off the ball.

24:24.798 --> 24:25.972
Give him some protection.
Let's go.

24:26.868 --> 24:27.933
All right,
86 change.

24:35.917 --> 24:38.683
<i>Blue 25! Blue 25!!</i>

24:39.845 --> 24:40.452
<i>Hut!</i>

24:46.056 --> 24:47.061
There it is. Good run.

24:52.615 --> 24:53.721
<i>Huddle up, come on.
Let's go!</i>

24:54.388 --> 24:55.012
<i>Huddle up. Geti it up,
Get it up.</i>

24:55.548 --> 24:56.170
<i>Let's go!</i>

24:57.468 --> 24:58.283
Let's go.

24:59.757 --> 25:01.480
Hey, y'all, how are you?

25:01.655 --> 25:03.030
Come on in. Good to see you.

25:03.637 --> 25:05.411
<i>Come on in. Welcome, welcome.</i>

25:05.735 --> 25:07.521
Hey, how are you? Oh.

25:07.686 --> 25:08.402
Hey!

25:09.016 --> 25:10.040
Girls, I--

25:10.528 --> 25:12.151
It is so good to see you again.

25:12.448 --> 25:13.282
You too.

25:14.196 --> 25:15.070
Great to see you there.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.512
Honey, go to the market.

25:18.758 --> 25:19.983
Buy all the steaks.

25:20.228 --> 25:22.601
Buy all the ribs.
Buy--buy all the barbecue sauce.

25:22.678 --> 25:23.243
Buy it all.

25:23.816 --> 25:25.063
Sweetie, go now.
Go now.

25:39.598 --> 25:42.470
Honey, can you please help me
put some ice in this cooler?

25:42.596 --> 25:43.731
Yeah, just a second.

25:44.045 --> 25:45.640
Oh, good.
Honey, where's the ice?

25:46.456 --> 25:46.873
The ice?

25:47.337 --> 25:48.641
The ice I was supposed to pick up?

25:49.395 --> 25:51.450
The ice that you forgot to get.
Get my wallet.

25:51.545 --> 25:52.761
I know, I know.
Buy the ice.

25:53.037 --> 25:53.590
Thank you.

25:54.117 --> 25:54.751
I'm sorry, honey.

25:55.015 --> 25:57.303
You know what? I gotta go smoke
some more meat.

25:57.725 --> 26:02.482
- Hey, I got cranberry juice and caramel apples.
- Oh, good. Fantastic.

26:02.658 --> 26:03.330
Excuse me, sorry.

26:04.637 --> 26:05.991
Hey, Julie. How's it going?

26:06.247 --> 26:08.081
Hey, um, it's great.

26:08.516 --> 26:09.491
Really, really great.

26:12.308 --> 26:13.733
Okay.

26:19.318 --> 26:22.680
I mean, this Tatom kid can bust
the season wide open for us,

26:22.756 --> 26:25.200
because, I mean, he's got great vision.
He's got great feet.

26:25.306 --> 26:27.402
He runs like a running back.
And he can throw the football.

26:27.555 --> 26:30.223
Well, has Coach decided
who's gonna start next week?

26:30.535 --> 26:31.181
I don't know.

26:31.705 --> 26:32.833
There he is, right there.

26:33.316 --> 26:34.322
We'll just ask the man.

26:35.176 --> 26:35.972
- Coach.
- Hey.

26:37.008 --> 26:38.992
Who are you gonna start next week?

26:39.497 --> 26:41.240
Who am I gonna start?
Tell you what, gentlemen.

26:41.336 --> 26:43.493
I'm thinking about revolutionizing
the whole offense.

26:43.596 --> 26:45.701
What I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna get rid of the quarterback,

26:45.808 --> 26:48.100
and I'm gonna have four running backs,
do a hell of a lot of reverses.

26:48.298 --> 26:49.172
That's what we're gonna do.

26:52.258 --> 26:53.342
What are you doing
down there?

26:53.457 --> 26:54.343
Cleaning up some beer.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.961
When you get done, would you help me
try to host up here?

26:57.106 --> 26:59.052
Well, no, actually I think I'm gonna
stay down here for a little while.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.240
That man's got a fine jaw line.

27:01.635 --> 27:02.450
Yes, he does.

27:04.015 --> 27:07.003
Hey, listen, I got the address
in Arnett Mead.

27:07.556 --> 27:10.948
The QB's car is a red '02 Mustang.

27:10.948 --> 27:11.940
We going tonight.

27:12.348 --> 27:15.002
- Where'd you get it?
- I got my ways.

27:17.548 --> 27:20.402
- Well, I'm sorry you're upset.
- Well, yeah, I'm upset.

27:20.667 --> 27:23.491
Well, you know what?
I should've given you more notice, all right?

27:23.536 --> 27:24.590
But I was a little bit busy.

27:24.716 --> 27:26.470
I know, I know.
Your job is really stressful.

27:26.585 --> 27:28.711
You know what, honey?
I'm doing it, all right?

27:28.847 --> 27:32.643
I threw the party for over 100 people
in two days' time.

27:32.815 --> 27:35.141
I did it with no help.
And I'm cleaning up

27:35.256 --> 27:38.211
after your football stars,
who by the way happen to be pigs.

27:38.327 --> 27:40.510
I'm doing it, but I'm not
gonna pretend to like it.

27:40.586 --> 27:42.042
Not right now.
Not down here.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.563
When I go back up there,
I'll give you a big smile.

27:44.627 --> 27:47.381
All right, just like I know you need.
But down here, I am pissed.

27:47.556 --> 27:49.200
And I am going to stay down here

27:49.336 --> 27:52.510
until I can get back up there
and give you your smile. All right?

27:53.105 --> 27:54.702
When you're done down here,

27:54.755 --> 27:58.002
it would be really great
if you'd come up and help me host.

28:01.066 --> 28:01.700
Hey, Coach.

28:02.708 --> 28:05.393
I know this is kind of not done,

28:05.698 --> 28:07.480
but I was wondering if maybe,

28:08.267 --> 28:10.091
off the record,
you could maybe tell me

28:10.346 --> 28:12.113
who you're thinking about
on the game on Friday,

28:12.286 --> 28:13.450
who you're thinking about
starting at quarterback--

28:13.578 --> 28:15.780
Seriously, you know who I'm gonna start?
I'm gonna start who I have to start.

28:15.838 --> 28:17.650
If you want it to be you,
you're gonna have to show me a lot more

28:17.757 --> 28:19.911
than what you've been showing me on the field
this week, all right?

28:23.038 --> 28:25.940
Hey, you need to be take
a deep breath and calm down

28:26.216 --> 28:29.720
before you go out there and you say something
that you're not gonna be able to take back.

28:29.868 --> 28:32.430
Something like what it's really like
to be the wife of the Panthers coach?

28:32.506 --> 28:34.222
- Like sometimes I hate it? Like right now?
- Hey, let me tell you something.

28:34.326 --> 28:36.381
This is my job.
This is what I do.

28:36.456 --> 28:36.831
It's a job--

28:37.135 --> 28:38.001
Oh, my--

28:38.817 --> 28:40.093
What the hell was that?

28:55.338 --> 28:57.181
Hey, QB baby, you coming?

28:57.597 --> 28:58.630
I--I don't think so.

28:59.286 --> 28:59.881
Oh, come on.

29:00.058 --> 29:01.292
Later, Bambi!

29:01.936 --> 29:04.703
Saracen, let's go.
You're coming.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.872
Come on, get in the car.
All right.

29:07.037 --> 29:07.693
Nice.

29:07.867 --> 29:10.343
Oh, yeah.

29:12.655 --> 29:14.553
Last piece of the puzzle,
gentlemen.

29:15.107 --> 29:15.723
Let's go.

29:23.275 --> 29:27.321
All right he's right there. Come on.
Come on now, let's do this, baby, come on.

29:28.276 --> 29:29.223
All right, let's go.

29:33.855 --> 29:34.652
<i>Wait up, wait up, wait up.</i>

29:35.207 --> 29:35.733
Let's go, man!

29:43.956 --> 29:45.320
Come on, let's go!
Come on, let's go!

29:47.598 --> 29:48.653
QB, get in!

29:51.977 --> 29:52.712
<i>Saracen!</i>

29:53.606 --> 29:54.870
<i>Saracen, come on!</i>

29:56.088 --> 29:58.433
<i>Saracen!
Saracen, Saracen, now!</i>

29:58.667 --> 30:00.750
Dad, get out here!

30:01.397 --> 30:01.921
<i>Saracen!</i>

30:02.756 --> 30:04.823
<i>Saracen, get in the car!</i>

30:05.958 --> 30:07.882
<i>get in the car!</i>

30:10.138 --> 30:11.273
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

30:15.258 --> 30:16.881
<i>Take this course
and you'll be just fine.</i>

30:17.756 --> 30:19.102
<i>Great job. Thank you.</i>

30:19.238 --> 30:21.783
<i>Hopefully I won't be
seeing you again soon.</i>

30:21.997 --> 30:23.752
- I'll see you in the halls.
- Okay.

30:24.186 --> 30:25.502
Hey, I'm next.

30:26.136 --> 30:26.961
What are you doing here?

30:28.317 --> 30:30.190
<i>It's very uncomfortable
sitting out there.</i>

30:32.056 --> 30:34.002
I'm sorry that you're mad at me.

30:35.077 --> 30:35.781
Hmm.

30:37.115 --> 30:38.253
I don't--
I'm sorry.

30:38.365 --> 30:40.971
I'm not sure that
that counts as an apology.

30:41.145 --> 30:42.893
"I'm sorry
that you're mad at me."

30:43.618 --> 30:46.042
I'm not sure that
that's actually officially--

30:46.975 --> 30:48.402
- You see what I'm saying?
- All right, come on.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.113
Listen, you know what I got
going on out there.

30:50.176 --> 30:51.590
I've got a very stressful job.

30:51.676 --> 30:53.591
You know, everybody's got
a stressful job.

30:54.177 --> 30:54.760
All right, yeah, but--

30:55.215 --> 30:57.862
Oh, you don't think
I have a stressful job?

30:58.008 --> 31:00.142
No, I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying--

31:00.257 --> 31:01.713
- You know what?
- I just am here to apologize

31:01.836 --> 31:02.901
- You know what I would love?
- For the party--

31:03.055 --> 31:07.601
I would love for you to try to talk
to a bunch of confused young kids

31:07.726 --> 31:11.490
who are all hopped up
on hormones and anxiety and stress.

31:11.807 --> 31:13.662
Not just, you know,
bark at 'em,

31:13.837 --> 31:16.600
or tell 'em where they need to carry the ball
for the next 30 seconds,

31:16.695 --> 31:18.341
but just to really sit down
and talk to 'em.

31:18.448 --> 31:19.862
- Okay.
- No, I mean seriously.

31:20.066 --> 31:22.652
You sit down and you do that,
and then you get back to me.

31:24.917 --> 31:25.762
Next!

31:26.608 --> 31:28.512
Watch out. She's a little
pissed off this afternoon.

31:40.837 --> 31:42.313
Where's that beautiful little girlfriend?

31:44.068 --> 31:45.830
You don't know anything
about my girlfriend,

31:45.965 --> 31:48.853
and you don't know
anything about my life. So...

31:49.265 --> 31:51.583
How about we just leave it alone
and you stay out of my face, okay?

31:52.636 --> 31:54.822
Actually, I know
everything about your life.

31:55.887 --> 31:57.372
Let me run down
the next two years for you.

31:57.488 --> 32:01.372
See, you're still in the golden,
"everyone rallies around you" phase.

32:02.336 --> 32:03.482
Yeah, they'll start to get
bored with that

32:03.578 --> 32:06.750
in about six weeks.
And then all the letters and cards

32:06.908 --> 32:09.403
and visits and prayers will
die down dramatically.

32:09.487 --> 32:10.373
Herc, just shut up.

32:10.418 --> 32:13.603
You know, another three months after that,
the girlfriend is gonna tell you all about

32:13.695 --> 32:15.400
how you're different people now.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.661
And how you need to find out
who you are apart.

32:18.025 --> 32:19.722
That'll be the end of her ass.

32:19.908 --> 32:24.652
Then maybe about two months after that,
the lawsuit will be in full swing,

32:24.726 --> 32:27.187
and you will lose people
who mean the world to you.

32:27.187 --> 32:28.510
- Herc, don't--
- So you can pay

32:28.598 --> 32:30.230
for fun things like colostomy bags.

32:30.327 --> 32:31.071
Get out of my face.

32:31.345 --> 32:33.103
And about maybe three, maybe
four months after that...

32:33.176 --> 32:35.962
- Get out of my face.
- Your parents will announce...

32:36.008 --> 32:36.551
Shut up.

32:36.675 --> 32:37.780
- that the stress of all this..
- Shut up!

32:37.877 --> 32:39.433
has driven such a wedge between them

32:39.525 --> 32:41.252
- that they've decided
- Herc, I'm warning you.

32:41.377 --> 32:44.503
- to go ahead and get a divorce because--
- Will you shut the hell up?!

32:50.926 --> 32:51.523
Good...

32:53.167 --> 32:55.182
I knew you had some fight in you.

33:16.918 --> 33:20.511
When I say there will be
no retaliation,

33:20.798 --> 33:24.503
I want you to remember
how you feel right now.

33:24.645 --> 33:25.480
That's ten.

33:26.786 --> 33:29.732
Now, is there anybody
that wants to tell me

33:30.348 --> 33:32.680
who went on this
little raid last night?

33:32.745 --> 33:35.593
We can end this all
right here and right now.

33:35.856 --> 33:37.681
Anybody want to 'fess up?

33:39.698 --> 33:40.920
All right, let's run ten more.

33:41.658 --> 33:43.532
- Let's run ten more!
- Let's go!

33:47.515 --> 33:48.701
Whoo, it's hot.

33:49.835 --> 33:50.793
Get up there!

34:15.344 --> 34:16.621
Well, look who it is.

34:17.496 --> 34:19.350
Mr. Alamo Freeze himself.

34:19.777 --> 34:21.659
That's a real cute hat
you have on there.

34:22.626 --> 34:23.512
Who was with you?

34:23.815 --> 34:26.179
Uh...no one.

34:26.717 --> 34:28.183
Heh. No one?

34:30.306 --> 34:31.552
There was no one else.

34:32.146 --> 34:33.150
I, uh...

34:33.465 --> 34:34.342
I had the bat.

34:34.878 --> 34:36.280
And the crow bar.

34:36.637 --> 34:38.853
I--I even drove the car
that I jumped into.

34:41.476 --> 34:42.610
Any of y'all want a Swizzler?

34:50.746 --> 34:52.940
This is what it's gonna
be like on the field.

34:59.717 --> 35:01.983
Hey, Coach, can we go
over some special teams sets?

35:02.036 --> 35:03.023
Mac, it's gonna have to wait.

35:03.168 --> 35:06.473
I've gotta get to my daughter's dance recital,
or Tami's gonna have me neutered.

35:06.636 --> 35:06.991
All right.

35:10.667 --> 35:11.711
Coach Taylor.

35:13.077 --> 35:15.640
<i>Coach...it's Saracen.</i>

35:16.685 --> 35:17.723
<i>I'm at the hospital.</i>

35:20.875 --> 35:21.651
Thank you, sir.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.501
I wouldn't get too excited.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.500
You and I are going
to a dance recital.

35:29.185 --> 35:30.161
You want to tell me what happened?

35:31.225 --> 35:32.681
Some of the Tigers players
wanted to know

35:32.818 --> 35:34.392
who trashed the QB's car.

35:37.226 --> 35:38.972
Why would they think that
you'd know about that?

35:40.246 --> 35:41.313
Because I was there.

35:44.458 --> 35:45.913
Did you name names?

35:46.457 --> 35:47.162
No, sir.

35:48.366 --> 35:49.840
And with all due respect, sir,

35:50.538 --> 35:51.402
I still won't.

35:54.636 --> 35:56.640
Look, I'm sorry I put you
on the spot the other night

35:56.778 --> 35:58.422
asking you about
who you're gonna start.

35:58.605 --> 36:00.593
Just seems like the whole
town wants you

36:01.477 --> 36:03.041
to make Tatom QB1.

36:04.438 --> 36:06.563
Even feels like my dad expects that.

36:07.687 --> 36:09.141
Let me tell you something.

36:11.627 --> 36:14.093
Your dad's not able to see what I see.

36:15.465 --> 36:19.041
You're a different kid
than you were two weeks ago.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.050
- I am?
- You are.

36:22.388 --> 36:24.142
You may have been
happy sitting on the bench

36:24.277 --> 36:26.003
letting Jason take the pressure.
I don't know.

36:26.108 --> 36:27.502
I don't need to know.
But I'll tell you what.

36:27.657 --> 36:29.160
I'm a firm believer
in you can do anything

36:29.257 --> 36:31.402
you put your mind to.
And yourself, you,

36:31.618 --> 36:34.301
I believe you can do anything
you put your mind to.

36:36.315 --> 36:38.302
- You really believe that, sir?
- I do.

36:41.948 --> 36:43.203
Thanks for coming to get me.

36:44.068 --> 36:44.803
You're welcome.

36:53.597 --> 36:54.141
Excuse me.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.573
Could you scoot down one, please?

37:01.968 --> 37:02.370
Hey.

37:03.518 --> 37:05.391
Hi, Matt, how are you?

37:07.408 --> 37:08.053
What happened?

37:14.415 --> 37:15.561
Are you all right, Matt?

37:15.895 --> 37:18.003
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.

37:24.106 --> 37:25.911
Julie hasn't gone on yet.

37:26.127 --> 37:26.953
Okay.

37:36.457 --> 37:37.883
<i>Do you wanna get with me</i>

37:38.316 --> 37:40.433
<i>You'll forget all the rest</i>

37:40.778 --> 37:43.043
<i>'Cause ain't no girl out like me</i>

37:43.387 --> 37:45.313
<i>Has got what I got</i>

37:46.467 --> 37:49.733
<i>I'm trying to get through</i>

37:50.187 --> 37:52.251
<i>I'll show you what to do</i>

37:52.767 --> 37:56.641
<i>Boy, I'll make you so, so, so addicted</i>

37:56.977 --> 37:58.100
<i>What I got</i>

37:58.545 --> 38:01.070
<i>I got that something
that you want</i>

38:02.108 --> 38:03.321
<i>What I got</i>

38:03.778 --> 38:07.352
<i>I got that something
that you dream about</i>

38:25.577 --> 38:26.772
I was wrong.

38:28.157 --> 38:29.392
All right?
I was wrong.

38:31.156 --> 38:32.502
Well, of course you were wrong.

38:32.607 --> 38:35.703
I mean, you gave me
no advance warning.

38:35.767 --> 38:38.303
- You know, and you just assumed--
- No, not about that.

38:38.687 --> 38:40.743
Listen, just what I'm saying is...

38:43.265 --> 38:45.251
I know how hard it is
what you do.

38:45.298 --> 38:47.240
I know it's not easy
talking to those kids.

38:47.287 --> 38:48.680
I know it's difficult.

38:49.638 --> 38:53.741
And I know my job has put you
through a hell of a lot.

38:53.867 --> 38:54.771
I understand that.

38:56.277 --> 38:58.631
I just wanted to make sure
you knew that I'm...

38:59.248 --> 39:01.142
thankful for everything
that you do.

39:01.188 --> 39:02.802
And I know you do a hell of a lot.

39:03.005 --> 39:03.920
Thank you.

39:04.488 --> 39:05.061
Friends?

39:07.925 --> 39:09.471
Friends?
Friends?

39:11.075 --> 39:12.281
Friends?

39:15.525 --> 39:16.261
Mmm. Hey.

39:16.978 --> 39:18.690
Oh, wow.
What happened?

39:19.105 --> 39:23.500
Oh, yeah, I just got beat up a little bit.
Just a little.

39:24.067 --> 39:26.402
But you were really--
Or that was--

39:27.095 --> 39:28.491
I really liked it.

39:29.005 --> 39:30.761
- Thanks.
- The music, too.

39:30.916 --> 39:31.722
The music was really cool.

39:31.866 --> 39:33.722
I don't know why, but for some reason
it kind of--

39:33.908 --> 39:36.772
it kind of reminded me
of this painter that I really like.

39:36.926 --> 39:39.453
Uh-huh, which painter would that be?

39:39.926 --> 39:43.000
Uh, this guy, um... Jackson Pollock.

39:43.156 --> 39:44.052
Yeah.

39:44.557 --> 39:45.922
I've heard of him before.

39:46.115 --> 39:46.710
Yeah.

39:47.315 --> 39:48.532
You ever seen any
of his stuff?

39:48.947 --> 39:52.622
Some of it, but I don't
really see the connection.

39:52.896 --> 39:53.821
You don't?

39:54.205 --> 39:55.422
Not really.

39:56.706 --> 39:57.411
Yeah.

39:57.638 --> 39:59.643
I gue--I guess it is
kind of stretch, huh?

39:59.968 --> 40:01.092
Maybe a little bit.

40:05.068 --> 40:05.953
What?

40:06.858 --> 40:08.030
- What, what?
- What?

40:12.018 --> 40:13.300
I think I told that kid

40:13.418 --> 40:15.571
to get our daughter
in the backseat of a car.

40:16.245 --> 40:17.340
Mama, Daddy.

40:19.478 --> 40:22.761
Aah!
You were amazing.

40:23.015 --> 40:23.963
Come here, come here, come here.

40:24.075 --> 40:24.842
Thank you, Mom.

40:25.157 --> 40:26.003
I can't believe it.

40:26.397 --> 40:29.553
I love you very much. Very much.

40:31.016 --> 40:32.933
- Mm-hmm.
- Good job. I love you.

40:33.756 --> 40:35.381
Good job, good job.

40:49.337 --> 40:50.530
What are you doing here?

40:56.686 --> 40:57.700
Lyla...

41:08.647 --> 41:10.461
My father is right downstairs.

41:10.557 --> 41:11.331
I know.

41:14.126 --> 41:14.830
Lyla...

41:19.487 --> 41:20.310
I can't...

41:21.267 --> 41:23.690
I can't stop thinking
about you, Lyla.

41:24.286 --> 41:25.132
I can't.

41:26.156 --> 41:26.980
No.

41:53.807 --> 41:55.693
<i>This is Slamming Sammy Mead</i>

41:55.886 --> 41:59.082
<i>signing off on the worst kind
of Friday in Dillon, Texas,</i>

41:59.316 --> 42:01.341
<i>and that's a Friday without a game.</i>

42:02.968 --> 42:04.680
<i>Well, next Friday night,</i>

42:04.825 --> 42:06.621
<i>I don't need to tell you, is the biggie.</i>

42:06.788 --> 42:08.141
<i>And I'm not the only one saying</i>

42:08.265 --> 42:10.560
<i>it could be the biggest
game of the season.</i>

42:11.916 --> 42:15.602
<i>The moment where this team
either gets past the loss of Jason Street</i>

42:15.706 --> 42:16.681
<i>and moves forward,</i>

42:17.165 --> 42:21.181
<i>or we watch the whole season
crumble right before our eyes.</i>

42:21.447 --> 42:22.723
<i>Now, I gotta believe we'll win</i>

42:22.798 --> 42:25.061
<i>because this town wants
that win so bad.</i>

42:25.777 --> 42:27.073
<i>And didn't Daddy tell us,</i>

42:27.547 --> 42:30.153
<i>"Winning goes to the one
who wants it most?"</i>
