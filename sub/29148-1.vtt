something might change.

it’s Liberty Belle, Britannica, or Zoya,

I know you made fun of national heroes

19:58.822 --> 19:59.698
All right.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.034
-[croupier] Pass line bets.
-All right. Pass line.

20:02.659 --> 20:03.493
Let's go.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.622
-[Reggie] Okay.
-[blows]

20:08.582 --> 20:09.666
Come on, mama.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.628
[Jenny squeals]

20:12.711 --> 20:14.296
-Seven. Well done.
-I won?

20:14.463 --> 20:15.297
You all won.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.632
-[all cheering]
-[big band music playing]

20:17.007 --> 20:19.635
-[Cherry] I won!
-Do that again. Exactly the same.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.220
Everyone who bet, bet again.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.846
-[Cherry] Okay.
-Okay.

20:26.141 --> 20:27.017
[blows]

20:27.267 --> 20:28.894
[chuckles softly]

20:31.271 --> 20:32.189
[Yolanda] Okay.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.398
Black magic.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.317
Seven. Winner.

20:35.400 --> 20:36.485
[all cheering]

20:40.530 --> 20:42.741
Nobody move! We got a hot table!

20:42.824 --> 20:44.660
Oh, my God, we’re winning money, bitches!

20:50.290 --> 20:51.959
Hey, Perry, any messages for me?

20:52.042 --> 20:53.961
No, sorry.

20:54.044 --> 20:57.172
-Oh, but... Miss Eagan.
-Yeah?

20:57.839 --> 20:59.383
Happy opening night.

21:00.801 --> 21:04.888
Um, could you have those sent
to the <i>GLOW </i>dressing room? Thank you.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.101
Hey, will you come here?
I wanna show you one thing.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.576
[Ruth exhales]

21:27.786 --> 21:28.704
[sighs]

21:28.787 --> 21:32.457
Oh, come on. I thought seeing our name
in lights would cheer you up.

21:33.292 --> 21:36.253
-Technically, it’s Bash’s name in lights.
-Well, that would...

21:37.045 --> 21:40.549
explain why no one knows who the fuck I am
or what I do. [exhales]

21:41.883 --> 21:45.971
Look, we may never open a show
in Las Vegas ever again.

21:46.054 --> 21:49.099
Just take a moment and appreciate
what is right in front of you,

21:49.182 --> 21:50.350
so you don’t miss it.

21:51.810 --> 21:54.521
Hey, this is me speaking as your producer.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.734
Everyone is up.
Don't bring them down into your...

21:59.776 --> 22:01.111
sinkhole of despair.

22:05.157 --> 22:05.991
[car door opens]

22:06.450 --> 22:08.285
Hey. That was fun last night.

22:08.535 --> 22:11.872
No, Todd, I...
What did we say? I'm not... I’m working.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.874
It's Chad.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.171
[car door closes]

22:19.254 --> 22:20.756
-Really?
-Yeah, really.

22:20.839 --> 22:25.010
He’s 25. I’m single.
Smoke ‘em if you got ‘em.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.640
God! Please make that cake go away!

22:30.849 --> 22:33.226
Um, can you take this downstairs
to the kitchen

22:33.310 --> 22:35.187
and ask them to turn it into some trifles?

22:35.270 --> 22:37.272
-[casino attendant] Right away.
-What's a trifle?

22:37.356 --> 22:40.650
Oh, it's like mashed-up cake with berries,
custard, and cream.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.905
Unless... you want them
to turn it into a penis cake.

22:45.614 --> 22:46.740
[exhales]

22:48.241 --> 22:49.409
Give us the room, please.

22:49.951 --> 22:51.411
Thank you so much.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.791
Thank you. Thank you.

22:58.001 --> 22:59.753
-Look...
-[door closes]

23:00.170 --> 23:03.465
all we need for a good party is alcohol,
drugs, and good people.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.592
-And we’ve got all of those.
-I didn't get any drugs.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.845
Well, I did. From the valet.
It’s all sorted.

23:10.180 --> 23:11.556
You didn’t have to do that.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.475
Well, it's my party, too, you know.

23:13.975 --> 23:17.062
And it’s the first time
we’re hosting together. It’s exciting.

23:17.354 --> 23:19.981
These producers I invited tonight,
they're-- they're legends.

23:20.065 --> 23:23.610
Donn Arden. Jeff Kutash. David Saxe.
Who, by the way, is still in high school

23:23.693 --> 23:25.362
and is somehow already a name
in this town.

23:25.445 --> 23:30.951
Well, maybe they should make a little room
for the new kid on the block.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.204
They were at the gift shop. I bought ten.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.749
My hair looks terrible.

23:37.833 --> 23:41.753
[laughs]
You’re bonkers. You look very handsome.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.339
And you’re on the cover. So...

23:44.840 --> 23:48.093
I don’t know why I’m so nervous.
I-- I’ve thrown a million parties,

23:48.176 --> 23:50.011
but I don’t know these people,

23:50.095 --> 23:51.763
and this isn’t my house,
and I don’t have--

23:52.431 --> 23:54.558
I-- I don't recognize half the names
on the guest list.

23:54.808 --> 23:55.642
Okay.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.562
I love meeting new people.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.814
-Uh-huh.
-[Rhonda] And I love parties.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.234
And... I love you.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.533
[romantic instrumental music playing]

24:14.494 --> 24:16.746
I thought you weren't sure
if you wanted to.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.833
Well, I want to. [chuckles]

24:27.632 --> 24:28.884
[laughs]

24:28.967 --> 24:32.262
-[both performing vocal exercise]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...

24:34.848 --> 24:37.100
I got you flour-s.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.686
Get it? Like, flour-s.

24:40.020 --> 24:42.397
Like, instead of flowers,
I got you flours.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.567
-Like, each individual grain of flour--
-You’re the sexiest nerd I’ve ever met.

24:45.650 --> 24:46.693
[Arthie] Thank you.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.153
[both giggle]

24:48.904 --> 24:50.030
Who sent those?

24:50.530 --> 24:51.698
You got a man?

24:52.073 --> 24:53.700
Oh, no, those are from Randy.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.995
So, really, they’re from my ex-husband
masquerading as my baby.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.582
Ernest sent me a box of See’s Candy.
No card, but I know it's him.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.625
Angel.

25:01.958 --> 25:04.211
Hey. You see this?

25:04.669 --> 25:06.087
[Debbie] Are you kidding me?

25:06.379 --> 25:08.381
I set up this whole photo shoot.

25:08.465 --> 25:11.301
I think they took a million pictures
of both of us.

25:11.384 --> 25:15.138
[Sam over intercom] <i>Ladies, hello.</i>
<i>Hello, Gorgeous Ladies of </i>GLOW.

25:15.430 --> 25:19.809
<i>It’s opening night. And-- And listen,</i>
<i>you know, I just wanna--</i> [clears throat]

25:19.893 --> 25:23.563
<i>I just wanna say that, uh, you...</i>
<i>you've all worked very hard--</i>

25:23.647 --> 25:26.358
-[switches intercom off]
<i>-</i>Well, I did wanna say something...

25:26.441 --> 25:28.818
[takes a deep breath] ...to all of you.
Um...

25:29.778 --> 25:30.612
Ooh!

25:31.488 --> 25:35.325
I wasn’t sure that we could, uh,
bounce back after this morning.

25:35.408 --> 25:36.785
What happened this morning?

25:40.372 --> 25:42.165
-The <i>Challenger.</i>
-[Reggie] Oh, my God.

25:42.249 --> 25:43.416
I forgot about it too.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.752
-Oh, it’s official. We’re assholes.
-[Debbie] No, no, no.

25:45.835 --> 25:47.754
You were professionals.

25:47.837 --> 25:48.797
You were sad.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.383
But you pulled it together
and you did your jobs.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.927
And tonight, thanks to your hard work--

25:54.010 --> 25:55.262
I-- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

25:56.513 --> 25:59.182
Can-- Can we just take
a moment of silence?

25:59.641 --> 26:02.143
We’re so lucky to all be here together.

26:02.227 --> 26:04.938
I know we’re not acknowledging anything
in the show, but...

26:05.313 --> 26:08.066
can we have a moment? Is that okay?

26:09.651 --> 26:11.653
-[Cherry] Yeah.
-Sure. [sighs]

26:14.906 --> 26:16.491
[under breath] Okay. [sighs]

26:28.587 --> 26:30.338
-Sorry, I need to put these somewhere.
-Shh!

26:30.422 --> 26:31.840
-Bash doesn’t want balloons at the--
-Shh!

26:31.923 --> 26:32.757
-[Dawn] Shh!
-Oh.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.093
We’re having a moment of silence
for the <i>Challenger.</i>

26:35.176 --> 26:36.720
Oh, shit. Sorry.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.014
Um, you can just put them in here.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.184
[Melrose]
What's his problem with balloons?

26:43.268 --> 26:45.186
Oh, no, no! Just-- Just leave 'em.

26:46.062 --> 26:47.147
Um, they float about,

26:47.230 --> 26:48.690
and floating reminds him
of the astronauts.

26:48.982 --> 26:49.899
That makes sense.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.235
[takes a deep breath]

26:54.696 --> 26:56.281
[Reggie giggles]

26:57.574 --> 27:00.035
-Stop. Come on, be respectful.
-I'm respectful.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.412
[shrieking and giggling]

27:02.495 --> 27:03.830
[Cherry] Shh!

27:04.664 --> 27:06.666
[shrieking and giggling continuing]

27:06.750 --> 27:08.752
[optimistic instrumental music playing]

27:16.843 --> 27:19.304
[giggling and excited chatter]

27:23.266 --> 27:24.684
Alan, looking great.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.102
Pal-ing with Alan.

27:26.394 --> 27:30.231
Kutash, I want comps to<i> Splash, </i>all right?
I wanna feel the water on my face.<i> </i>

27:30.315 --> 27:32.400
Okay. Hey, looking good.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.864
-What the fuck is going on with your hair?
-I love this town, I love my wife.

27:37.947 --> 27:39.157
How the girls doing, huh?

27:39.240 --> 27:41.826
Uh, they're good. I think they're good.
I gave 'em a big pep talk.

27:41.910 --> 27:43.495
-Great.
-I think it was my best pep talk.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.080
-I think they're gonna do great.
-Hey!

27:45.163 --> 27:47.582
-Oh, hi.
-All right. [chuckles]

27:47.666 --> 27:49.626
-Good evening. Hi, there.
-[Bash] Hi.

27:49.709 --> 27:52.087
God, I love opening nights.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.632
-You're a little underdressed.
-Well, I can't fucking watch.

27:55.715 --> 27:57.884
Too many...
Too many cues and costume changes.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.302
I'll be out at the bar.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.264
Is that your husband,
or grandfather, or...

28:03.348 --> 28:05.809
Gentlemen, this is Bernie Rubenstein.

28:06.184 --> 28:09.437
Bernie Rubenstein,
director and choreographer of <i>Rhapsody?</i>

28:09.521 --> 28:10.980
[quietly] The longest running show
at the Fan-Tan.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.566
-[in normal voice] What an honor.
-Bernie can’t really hear much.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.568
-[loudly] What an honor!
-[Sandy] He never misses

28:15.652 --> 28:16.486
an opening night.

28:16.569 --> 28:19.489
He’s a good-luck charm.
[loudly] Isn’t that right, Bernie?

28:19.656 --> 28:20.865
What is this show again?

28:21.491 --> 28:23.868
It's lady wrestlers. You're gonna love it.

28:23.952 --> 28:26.996
Oh! I used to wrestle in high school,
you know.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.709
[Dawn, as Edna] Hi! Here we are!
The showgirls have arrived!

28:30.792 --> 28:33.169
Hey! You know, they used to call me
"the slot machine,"

28:33.253 --> 28:36.131
but they put me out of commission,
'cause they said my slot was too loose.

28:36.214 --> 28:38.091
-Hey!
-Cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching!

28:38.174 --> 28:39.801
-[laughter]
-Can't keep anything in there.

28:39.884 --> 28:43.054
-[laughter and applause]
-[Dawn] Man, I'd love to be a call girl,

28:43.138 --> 28:44.431
-[Stacey] Really?
-[Dawn] but I can't figure out

28:44.514 --> 28:45.932
how to use the answering machine.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.642
-[both] Oh!
-[audience laughs]

28:47.726 --> 28:49.644
[Stacey] They asked me to be
a lady of the night.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.021
-But I can't stay up past 6:00 p.m.
-[both] Oh!

28:52.105 --> 28:54.232
[Dawn] You know,
they call me an old bird,

28:54.315 --> 28:57.610
but, really, I'd prefer the early bird,
if you know what I mean!

28:57.694 --> 29:00.071
[comedy routine continuing indistinctly]

29:00.155 --> 29:02.657
[audience cheers and applauds]

29:08.037 --> 29:09.080
Are you ready?

29:09.706 --> 29:10.749
I guess.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.377
-It's been a weird day.
-[Bash] And, in this corner,

29:14.461 --> 29:18.298
-at a combined weight of 227 pounds...
-[audience booing]

29:21.968 --> 29:22.969
[door opens]

29:25.305 --> 29:26.347
[Sam] Whoa!

29:27.849 --> 29:29.559
-Holy shit.
-[Ruth laughs]

29:30.143 --> 29:31.519
Really? It’s okay?

29:31.811 --> 29:33.646
Sheila got it for me
at the lost-and-found.

29:33.980 --> 29:34.981
And you ruined it.

29:35.064 --> 29:38.151
I mean, I don’t need to know that.
Now I’m thinking about how it got there.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.779
-You look nice, too.
-[Sam] Hmm.

29:41.613 --> 29:45.074
Thank you.
Wanna have a drink before we go up?

29:45.950 --> 29:46.951
[clicks tongue]

29:47.827 --> 29:50.371
Fine. Well, just come in
and watch me have a drink, then.

29:51.581 --> 29:53.917
Come on. I got you an opening-night card.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.168
-[Ruth] You did?
-No.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.213
But I thought about it for a few seconds.
Would've been good.

29:58.505 --> 29:59.422
[laughs]

30:05.470 --> 30:06.513
[Sam] Okay.

30:09.474 --> 30:10.517
That's too much.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.727
[Sam] All right. You know,
don't finish it, all right?

30:13.311 --> 30:14.187
Cheers.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.736
Wow, what a day.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.321
The worst.

30:25.198 --> 30:29.202
You know, when I was making
my first movie, Robert Kennedy was shot.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.788
-Oh!
-Yeah, it was awful.

30:32.747 --> 30:35.416
We were all, you know,
covered in fake blood and we...

30:35.500 --> 30:37.126
You know, what do you do? We...

30:38.211 --> 30:39.170
We kept working.

30:42.298 --> 30:44.843
My dad was watching the launch today
with his whole class.

30:45.093 --> 30:46.344
-Science?
-Yeah.

30:46.427 --> 30:47.971
-Oh!
-Eighth graders.

30:48.096 --> 30:49.097
[Sam] Mmm!

30:49.973 --> 30:52.559
Those kids all watched that happen
in real time.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.979
Did you, uh, call him?

30:56.396 --> 30:58.523
My dad? No. No.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.026
I knew I’d fall apart
if I heard his voice.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.654
Had to make it through the day.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.448
We did.
