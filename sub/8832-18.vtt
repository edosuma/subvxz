15:32.533 --> 15:33.800
>> ALL RIGHT, BUD, HAVE FUN.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.067
>> WE BAD. SAY IT. WE BAD.

15:35.067 --> 15:35.600
>> WE BAD.

15:35.600 --> 15:36.200
>> WE BAD.

15:36.200 --> 15:36.767
>> WE BAD.

15:36.767 --> 15:37.767
>> WE BAD.

15:37.767 --> 15:38.933
HE AIN'T BAD.

15:38.933 --> 15:40.667
HE AIN'T BAD AT ALL.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.333
WE DID A GOOD JOB MAKING HIM

15:45.333 --> 15:46.700
LOOK LIKE A REAL CONVICT.

15:46.700 --> 15:47.267
THOSE KIDS ON THE RIGHT PATH.

15:47.267 --> 15:48.600
IF BY NOW YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

15:48.600 --> 15:49.833
HE'S NOT WALKING INTO A ROOMFUL

15:49.833 --> 15:51.067
OF TEENAGERS, YOU'VE NEVER SEEN

15:51.067 --> 15:51.733
OUR SHOW BEFORE.

15:51.733 --> 15:52.733
>> THERE'S NO TEENAGERS.

15:52.733 --> 15:53.233
THERE'S --

15:53.233 --> 15:55.967
>> NO, NO, NO!

15:55.967 --> 15:56.700
>> HARD LEFT.

15:56.700 --> 15:57.467
>> HARD LEFT.

15:57.467 --> 15:58.533
>> GOOD LUCKY, BUDDY.

15:58.533 --> 16:00.067
WE'RE LEAVING YOU TO YOUR OWN

16:00.067 --> 16:01.500
DEVICES ON THIS ONE, PAL, SO...

16:01.500 --> 16:02.400
>> DO YOUR BEST, BUD.

16:02.400 --> 16:05.167
DO YOUR BEST.

16:05.167 --> 16:07.200
>> SHUT UP!

16:09.967 --> 16:11.633
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANYBODY.

16:11.633 --> 16:13.200
I GOT A STORY TO TELL.

16:13.200 --> 16:15.100
I GOT A LESSON TO TEACH.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.433
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE SILENCE.

16:17.433 --> 16:19.300
I WANT SILENCE!

16:21.733 --> 16:24.200
MY NAME IS SALVO CANO, AND I'VE

16:24.200 --> 16:27.567
BEEN LOCKED UP FOR 20 YEARS.

16:29.400 --> 16:31.133
I SAID "SHUT UP!"

16:32.467 --> 16:33.733
>> YOU'RE REALLY SCARING THESE

16:33.733 --> 16:34.100
KIDS.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.233
>> PRISON IS NOT A GAME!

16:36.233 --> 16:37.333
YOU THINK YOU'RE HARD?

16:37.333 --> 16:38.867
I'M THE HARD ONE!

16:38.867 --> 16:40.500
I'LL SHOW YOU HARD!

16:40.500 --> 16:42.300
I WILL SHOW YOU HARD!

16:42.300 --> 16:43.900
>> THAT'S A RETIRED COP.

16:44.867 --> 16:46.533
>> TELL YOU ABOUT MYSELF.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.533
WHEN I WAS YOUNG LIKE YOU GUYS,

16:48.533 --> 16:50.467
I THOUGHT I WAS TOUGH.

16:51.700 --> 16:53.067
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

16:53.067 --> 16:54.867
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TOUGH WAS

16:54.867 --> 16:56.467
UNTIL I WENT TO PRISON!

16:58.333 --> 16:59.600
>> YOUR TABLEFUL OF PROPS ARE

16:59.600 --> 17:00.700
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.

17:00.700 --> 17:01.967
>> I GOT SOME STUFF I WANT TO

17:01.967 --> 17:03.600
TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

17:05.067 --> 17:06.667
I USED TO DO GRAFFITI!

17:06.667 --> 17:07.600
>> YEAH, GOOD GUESS.

17:07.600 --> 17:08.267
>> ALL RIGHT.

17:08.267 --> 17:09.400
>> I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.733
I HAD A TAG NAME.

17:11.733 --> 17:13.067
JA-CRISPY.

17:16.067 --> 17:17.700
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE PENALTY IS

17:17.700 --> 17:18.500
FOR GRAFFITI?

17:18.500 --> 17:20.133
AT FIRST, IT'S JUST A CITATION.

17:20.133 --> 17:21.767
BUT WHEN YOU KEEP IT UP, YOU'LL

17:21.767 --> 17:24.100
LAND YOUR ASS IN THE CLINK.

17:24.100 --> 17:25.800
>> YOU'RE NOT SCARY ENOUGH.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.733
>> YOU LOOK NICE AND TIGHT, BOY.

17:28.633 --> 17:29.767
THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA

17:29.767 --> 17:30.533
TELL YOU IN THERE.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.900
NOW, DRUGS!

17:32.900 --> 17:34.567
>> IT'S A BAG OF TYLENOL.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.967
>> YOU GUYS WANT TO SPEND THE

17:35.967 --> 17:38.267
NEXT 50 YEARS IN HERE WITH ME?!

17:38.267 --> 17:40.067
>> SHE'S LAUGHING!

17:43.133 --> 17:43.767
>> THESE HURT.

17:43.767 --> 17:45.200
THESE HURT WHEN THEY PUT THEM ON

17:45.200 --> 17:45.700
YOU.

17:45.700 --> 17:47.567
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR PARENTS TO

17:47.567 --> 17:48.733
SEE YOU IN THESE.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.667
>> YOU'RE REALLY SCARING THEM

17:52.667 --> 17:53.500
STRAIGHT, BUD.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.867
>> SO...

17:54.867 --> 17:56.933
THIS IS SO NOT TEENS.

17:56.933 --> 17:59.800
>> TAKE THE GLASSES OFF.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.867
>> OH.

18:05.433 --> 18:07.600
THERE'S SO MANY OF YOU.

18:08.933 --> 18:10.100
>> SHUT YOUR FACE, GRANDMA!

18:10.100 --> 18:11.833
>> SHUT YOUR FACE, GRANDMA!

18:14.300 --> 18:15.333
>> YOU KEEP IT UP.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.167
KEEP DOING IT.

18:16.167 --> 18:17.433
YOU GOT TO STILL DO IT.

18:17.433 --> 18:18.900
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?

18:21.633 --> 18:22.833
MEANS I KILLED SOMEBODY.

18:22.833 --> 18:24.267
>> YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY

18:24.267 --> 18:25.500
INK I GOT?

18:25.500 --> 18:26.900
>> YOU THINK THIS IS THE ONLY

18:26.900 --> 18:27.600
INK I GOT.

18:27.600 --> 18:28.733
OH...

18:28.733 --> 18:29.800

18:29.800 --> 18:30.833
YOU MIGHT WANT TO SHOW THEM,

18:30.833 --> 18:31.167
BUDDY.

18:31.167 --> 18:32.267
>> SHOW THEM YOUR OTHER TATTOO.

18:32.267 --> 18:34.433
>> THERE'S A TATTOO ON MY LEG

18:34.433 --> 18:37.633
THAT I'M GONNA SHOW YOU.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.400
I'VE BEEN LAUGHED AT ENOUGH FOR

18:41.400 --> 18:42.500
IT, SO PIPE DOWN.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.233
>> SAL, KNOCK THE CHAIR OVER.

18:47.233 --> 18:48.500
>> THROW THAT CHAIR. GET ANGRY.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.367
>> NO ONE HERE'S GONNA END UP IN

18:56.367 --> 18:57.100
PRISON, RIGHT?

18:57.100 --> 18:57.833
>> RIGHT!

18:57.833 --> 18:58.833

19:12.233 --> 19:13.600
BUDDY, AND YOU LEAVE.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.500
>> THIS IS IT.

19:16.500 --> 19:17.667
THIS IS WHAT I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU

19:17.667 --> 19:19.733
WITH BECAUSE THIS IS THE THING

19:19.733 --> 19:21.833
THAT YOU SHOULD FEAR THE MOST.

19:23.767 --> 19:25.500
