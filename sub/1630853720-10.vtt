WEBVTT

00:14.639 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.782
Are your feet, like, super-cold?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.285
I got icicle toes over here.

00:37.495 --> 00:39.456
Oh, duh. Boots.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.209
Never been a shoe guy.
Feels like being in foot prison.

00:43.293 --> 00:45.628
I suppose it's the same with shirts, then?

00:45.712 --> 00:48.715
If that's an issue,
this is the first I'm hearing of it.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.217
I wish the lift was running,

00:51.301 --> 00:53.470
'cause before we climb
this ridiculous mountain,

00:53.553 --> 00:56.556
how can we be sure
that Klaus and Veruca are even here?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.518
I think we can be sure.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.154
-Ugh.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.781
Veruca, focus.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.910
But wait. How can we even be sure
the monkey came here with the whip?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.665
I think we can be sure.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.837
-I'll take that!

01:27.921 --> 01:30.215
Uh, and that!

01:30.298 --> 01:32.759
-Stop her. Stop her!

01:32.842 --> 01:34.427
Come on! What was that?

01:34.511 --> 01:37.430
Just taking my cut!

01:39.140 --> 01:40.934
I could use a couple of these.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.310
Stop her!

01:48.233 --> 01:50.902
I'll just take a few more for the road.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.239
If you think you're walking out of here
with half of my treasury,

01:54.322 --> 01:57.283
you truly underestimate
my might and power!

02:00.036 --> 02:03.039
You don't know might and power.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.084
Wait, what?

02:06.167 --> 02:07.418
What?

02:20.265 --> 02:24.102
Sorry we couldn't come to
some kind of an agreement.

02:24.185 --> 02:27.397
I'll be on my way…

02:32.110 --> 02:35.029
Well, that was easy.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.407
Whose idea was it
to put a booby trap there?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.788
You get a promotion.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.374
I'll call you
Captain Booby Trap from now on.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.458
Ooh.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.295
First assignment: clean up this mess!

02:50.378 --> 02:51.462
Oh…

02:51.546 --> 02:56.217
So much power in something so tiny.

02:56.301 --> 03:01.764
With power like this,
I shall capture the Dragon Master myself!

03:18.656 --> 03:20.867
Klaus, do you hear something?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.202
-What?
-Behind us.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.954
Hold on, hold on, hold on!

03:26.664 --> 03:28.666
Well, well, well.

03:30.877 --> 03:34.088
-This is perfect.

03:34.172 --> 03:38.134
Why don't we let them
take care of the bears, eh? Eh?

03:38.217 --> 03:41.679
We can snag that whip
and kill two bears with one stone.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.806
Then we mop up what's left.

03:44.307 --> 03:48.519
Don't look so surprised.
I can make plans too, I can.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.075
Po, stop it! Quiet down.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.912
Did you see
my drift around that corner?

04:05.995 --> 04:08.122
-That was awesome.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.835
Ugh, we're too late.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.590
Or we're right on time.

04:19.008 --> 04:22.762
Everyone, remain calm!
Hands off that whip!

04:23.888 --> 04:25.682
Former Dragon Master?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.433
Ooh, that still stings.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.810
Stand down, weasels!

04:28.893 --> 04:30.645
Weasels? You mean the monkey?

04:30.728 --> 04:32.146
-The monkey?
-The whip!

04:32.230 --> 04:33.731
He's got the whip.

04:34.232 --> 04:35.149
Arrest them!

04:35.233 --> 04:37.151
-Hold it right there.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.825
The former Dragon Master
has turned himself in,

04:43.908 --> 04:47.829
afraid to stand in defiance
of his mighty Emperor.

04:47.912 --> 04:50.623
-She actually sold you the whip.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.501
The monkey? No. She tried to play me.

04:53.584 --> 04:55.211
Uh, sorry, who are you?

04:55.795 --> 04:58.006
This is Luthera of Landreth,

04:58.089 --> 04:59.465
the Wandering Blade,

04:59.549 --> 05:02.760
Daughter of the Saxon Guard,
Knight of England.

05:02.844 --> 05:06.597
-You actually got it right.

05:06.681 --> 05:07.682
Yeah, I did.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.268
And?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.979
And we're on a mission
to stop the weasels,

05:13.062 --> 05:14.939
because see, they got the gauntlet.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.359
And there's these Tianshang Weapons
that nobody thought were real,

05:18.443 --> 05:21.362
but we saw them in a comic book,
so we went to Li Gao Stu…

05:21.446 --> 05:24.324
I was dressed as Bamboozle,
'cause you see, I was in the Wankun,

05:24.407 --> 05:26.993
and I had the gaunt--
Uh, well yeah, that was embarr--

05:27.076 --> 05:30.455
We captured Klaus and Veruca,
but she's got this crazy mage power

05:30.538 --> 05:33.833
where the vines come out of the ground,
and it's like, blah! Blade was--

05:33.916 --> 05:36.961
Then we found the Lost City,
which wasn't even really a city--

05:37.045 --> 05:40.506
The weasels are collecting the weapons,
and we thought they were coming here.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.385
So, I'm supposed to believe

05:44.469 --> 05:47.597
that you've been destroying towns
and beating up my guards

05:47.680 --> 05:49.891
because you're after two other criminals?

05:49.974 --> 05:51.601
Oh! Yes. You nailed it.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.812
They have one magical weapon,
and they're coming for that whip.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.814
We're here to save you!

05:58.066 --> 05:59.400
Fabulous.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.277
Send them to the dungeon!

06:01.360 --> 06:02.612
-Wait!

06:02.695 --> 06:05.114
No, you have to believe us.
You're in danger!

06:05.198 --> 06:06.365
Oh, really?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.701
And I'm supposed to take you at your word?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.621
Maybe you can't take mine,
but she's a knight,

06:11.704 --> 06:13.414
sent by the Queen of England.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.042
She's the most honorable person
I've ever met.

06:16.125 --> 06:18.252
She's got a whole code and everything!

06:18.336 --> 06:21.297
You don't have to believe me,
but you gotta trust her.

06:22.006 --> 06:23.758
-I do.

06:23.841 --> 06:24.842
With my life.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.680
She's no knight.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.229
Is today Dramatic Entrance Day?

06:38.439 --> 06:39.941
Who's this guy now?

06:41.901 --> 06:43.903
A knight of England.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.615
-Trappy rope launcher guy is a knight?
-Uh…

06:47.698 --> 06:49.033
What a twist.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.089
Sent by the Queen herself.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.134
To arrest her.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.804
-What is he talking about?

07:10.304 --> 07:13.099
I… I… I…

07:13.975 --> 07:16.894
-There may be a misunderstanding.
-She is a thief.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.522
You stole
that suit of armor and that sword

07:19.605 --> 07:21.441
from the knights' barracks in London.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.693
But here, your lie ends.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.571
And I do have proof.

07:27.155 --> 07:29.031
Hm.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.658
Ooh, a decree,

07:30.741 --> 07:33.619
signed by the Queen herself.

07:33.703 --> 07:37.039
You can take my personal ship
back to England.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.667
Just be careful. It's a lease.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.044
Much appreciated, Emperor.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.337
Take her.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.506
-But you're a knight.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.426
You have the book and the sword
and the no-nonsense attitude.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.347
Po, I'm, I'm not a knight.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.872
-Hey! No, no, no! Hey, look.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.790
You can't lock me up. We're in danger.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.836
Klaus and Veruca are coming for that whip,
and they've got this crazy dark magic

08:23.920 --> 08:26.756
that controls roots
and plants and leaves and stuff!

08:27.548 --> 08:30.426
Oh no! Hide the chrysanthemums!

08:32.845 --> 08:35.932
Why don't you grab us some dinner?
I'll take it from here.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.644
Weimin!

08:39.727 --> 08:40.603
Buddy!

08:40.686 --> 08:43.064
Buddy? You mocking me?

08:43.147 --> 08:45.191
Ol' Weimin's fallen from grace.

08:45.274 --> 08:48.986
Demoted to a lowly dungeon guard,
all because of you!

08:49.070 --> 08:50.863
What? That's so unfair.

08:50.947 --> 08:54.116
Why don't you let me out of here
and I'll go tell the Emperor myself.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.036
Ha! Nice try. Get comfy…

09:00.081 --> 09:02.667
Dragon Disaster.

09:05.461 --> 09:07.672
Nailed it!

09:15.805 --> 09:18.224
Oh, my boy!

09:18.307 --> 09:20.893
Not now, imaginary Dad.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.812
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.064
Oh, turn around, Po.

09:26.524 --> 09:29.026
Dad! You're not made of moss, are you?

09:29.110 --> 09:31.529
I… don't think so.

09:31.612 --> 09:33.698
I can't believe it!
What are you doing here?

09:33.781 --> 09:39.203
Well, the Emperor tried to torture me
and get information on where you were.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.373
But I didn't give them anything!

09:42.456 --> 09:44.542
They'd have to drown me in the ocean,

09:44.625 --> 09:46.335
revive my waterlogged body,

09:46.419 --> 09:50.381
wait 20 or 30 minutes for me to dry,
and light me on fire

09:50.464 --> 09:52.842
before I told them where you went.

09:52.925 --> 09:56.178
-I didn't tell you where I went.
-That was very helpful, thank you.

09:56.262 --> 10:00.683
What happened, Po?
Did you find what you were looking for?

10:05.521 --> 10:08.149
Theft of royal armor and weaponry,

10:08.232 --> 10:10.026
evading and resisting arrest,

10:10.610 --> 10:13.988
fleeing the country as a fugitive, and…

10:14.071 --> 10:15.823
impersonating a knight.

10:15.906 --> 10:19.702
Bold, but absolutely mad.
You had to know we'd catch you.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.038
Do you realize why I'm here?

10:22.121 --> 10:25.958
You're a criminal,
so to do crimes, I suppose?

10:26.042 --> 10:30.171
Flaunting your assumed status as a knight,
chaos, destruction, what have you?

10:33.215 --> 10:34.675
I'm here for vengeance.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.428
Klaus and Veruca DuMont are in China.

10:37.511 --> 10:39.555
Should I know who they are?

10:39.639 --> 10:43.726
The last of the mages,
the murderers of Sir Alfred of Landreth!

10:43.809 --> 10:46.395
Sir Alfred.
That's whose sword you stole, right?

10:46.479 --> 10:47.605
Listen closely, Colin.

10:47.688 --> 10:48.689
They killed my brother

10:48.773 --> 10:51.233
and now they're seeking
the four Tianshang Weapons.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.279
They already have one -
a gauntlet that can destroy a city -

10:55.363 --> 10:58.783
and they're about to get another
if I'm not there to stop them.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.828
Did you say a gauntlet?

11:11.754 --> 11:15.049
And then the Emperor
was all, like, "Take them away."

11:16.634 --> 11:18.803
Don't get me started on Blade.
This whole time

11:18.886 --> 11:22.348
she made me feel like an idiot
for not meeting her knightly standards,

11:22.431 --> 11:26.268
and now I feel like an idiot for
believing her in the first place.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.521
Ow, ow, ow! Come on!

11:28.604 --> 11:31.690
Maybe it's not so black and white.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.776
No. It is.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.655
It's all up to me now. Klaus and Veruca
could attack at any second

11:37.738 --> 11:40.491
and I'm trapped in a dungeon with my dad.
Sneak attack!

11:42.535 --> 11:44.537
Oh, you gotta be kidding! Ah, come on!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.877
Looking to bust out, eh?

11:53.254 --> 11:54.213
Me three.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.384
-It's the Raider of Raipur!
-Huh?

11:58.467 --> 11:59.677
Told you I was famous.

11:59.760 --> 12:01.429
Can you really get us out?

12:01.512 --> 12:04.807
Oh, yes. But nothing comes free.

12:04.890 --> 12:06.434
If I help you…

12:07.101 --> 12:09.353
I leave with the whip.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.820
-You let them get away?
-How was I supposed to know?

12:17.903 --> 12:20.239
Nobody even talks about the mages anymore.

12:20.322 --> 12:24.243
And it's not as if they carry signs
that say, "England's Most Wanted."

12:24.326 --> 12:26.954
We can still make it
if we turn back now.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.038
Turn back?

12:28.122 --> 12:30.708
Surely you aren't going
to let them get away again?

12:30.791 --> 12:32.334
They're not my mission, you are!

12:32.418 --> 12:34.545
And a knight
always completes their mission.

12:34.628 --> 12:36.630
It's more complicated than that.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.634
I'll inform the Queen of their escape
and the knights will take care of it.

12:40.718 --> 12:44.930
I'm not getting on that ship.
It'll take us a month just to get back.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.765
Po is in trouble now!

12:46.849 --> 12:47.808
Keep walking.

12:47.892 --> 12:52.271
After my brother died,
I watched the knights train every day.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.857
Am I supposed to be intimidated

12:54.940 --> 12:56.275
because you're a fan?

12:56.358 --> 12:57.193
No.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.653
Because I know all your moves.

13:35.606 --> 13:39.193
Uh, excuse me, guard? I have a question.

13:39.693 --> 13:42.947
The Raider of Raipur in action. Oh!

13:43.030 --> 13:46.283
E-Escape artist
of mystical status.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.786
A master plan, feats of legend.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.455
You're going to tell
your kids about this one day.

13:51.539 --> 13:55.084
If this is about a bathroom break,
you can use the--

13:55.167 --> 13:56.585
Hey!

13:58.045 --> 13:58.879
Hm.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.340
Not as intricate as I expected.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.718
But still, an absolute treat to watch.

14:06.929 --> 14:10.182
If you need a bathroom break,
well, I suggest you hold it.

14:10.266 --> 14:12.434
-Oh, son.
-Dad.

14:20.568 --> 14:21.860
Zhen?

14:22.361 --> 14:23.696
Oh, hey.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.114
What are you doing here?

14:25.197 --> 14:30.452
Eh, something about destruction
of "imperial property" with fireworks?

14:32.413 --> 14:33.873
What are you doing here?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.916
Alright, come on.

14:38.043 --> 14:41.797
Nah. I'm gonna stay here for a while.

14:46.302 --> 14:47.428
What is that?

14:52.433 --> 14:54.476
-Oh, come on!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.854
Why do I even have doors?

14:58.188 --> 15:00.900
Hello, hello, hello…

15:33.182 --> 15:36.226
You'll never be one of us.
You're a disgrace to England!

15:48.155 --> 15:51.408
Ah! Black Steel of the Equinox, eh?

15:54.328 --> 15:56.747
When I bring Klaus and Veruca
to the Queen's feet,

15:56.830 --> 15:58.332
she'll see that I'm worthy.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.209
The Queen wants you in chains!

16:08.592 --> 16:09.718
Whoa.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.937
Ursa Major!

16:37.746 --> 16:40.624
An honorable knight
would let their opponent live.

16:40.708 --> 16:44.169
Well, like you said, I'm not a knight.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.267
This isn't over!

16:58.350 --> 16:59.685
I'll find you.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.603
I'm sure you will.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.648
But you'll have to chew
through those ropes first.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.883
Hm. That glove is pretty powerful.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.177
That was just the pinky. Hide.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.890
Rukhmini-- Where did she-- Ah, great.

17:39.308 --> 17:40.893
-Right.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.479
On my own. Cool, cool, cool.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.355
Let's do this.

17:48.150 --> 17:51.904
Give up now, before I unleash the thunder!

17:54.698 --> 17:55.574
What's so funny?

17:55.657 --> 17:57.951
Thunder's just a bunch of sound, isn't it?

17:58.035 --> 18:00.287
-Yeah, not very intimidating.
-No!

18:00.370 --> 18:03.457
Ah, maybe you meant to say,
"unleash the lightning!"

18:03.540 --> 18:06.710
Yes, lightning.
Much more dangerous, lightning.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.836
Fine, I'll…

18:07.920 --> 18:11.673
I'll unleash
the very sharp and punishing fury!

18:12.257 --> 18:13.801
We gave you "lightning,"

18:13.884 --> 18:16.512
and you still went with
a very kind of vague…

18:16.595 --> 18:18.222
Never mind.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.937
Ow!

18:29.858 --> 18:31.318
How are you doing, son?

18:31.401 --> 18:32.611
Fantastic.

18:39.993 --> 18:42.037
-Whoa!

18:42.121 --> 18:44.206
-Veruca!

18:53.632 --> 18:54.466
No you don't.

18:58.303 --> 18:59.596
Whoa!

19:03.725 --> 19:05.727
-Ah!
-Dad, what are you doing?

19:05.811 --> 19:07.688
Looked like you could use some help.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.039
Wow, you make this look so much harder!

19:26.123 --> 19:28.125
Mm-hm.

19:29.501 --> 19:31.920
I like your new partner, Pandy.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.672
'Bout as useful as the last!

19:40.345 --> 19:41.180
Hm.

19:44.600 --> 19:47.644
Not so tough
without your whip, eh?

19:47.728 --> 19:50.689
Not so tough
without your muscle, eh?

19:54.651 --> 19:55.485
Ow!

20:16.089 --> 20:18.926
Why don't you
let me take it from here?

20:43.242 --> 20:47.162
In the name of China,
I demand you stop right there!

20:50.791 --> 20:52.709
I've tasted freedom, old man.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.754
Looks like you'll have to
chase me down!

21:02.886 --> 21:04.429
-Huh?

21:29.871 --> 21:31.498
Your friend lied to you.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.294
And your own Emperor
ripped away your title.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.754
Turned your country against you.

21:37.838 --> 21:41.049
-I know what that feels like, I do.

21:48.598 --> 21:52.311
At a certain point, you ask yourself
if they're worth dying over.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.648
Huh?

22:00.193 --> 22:01.194
Huh?

22:03.196 --> 22:04.031
Po.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.166
-I don't need a title to know who I am.
