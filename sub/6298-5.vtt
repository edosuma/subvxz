Your mistress deludes
herself if she believes

00:17.684 --> 00:19.718
she can be victor
over the Pope of Rome.

00:19.786 --> 00:21.954
The papal armies of
Rome barely exist.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.755
The articles of war
demand the papal army

00:23.823 --> 00:26.358
at full strength number:
10,000 men-at-arms.

00:26.392 --> 00:27.926
You have less
than half that.

IL CEREMONIERE:
Ambassador of the Court

00:29.362 --> 00:32.231
of his Highness
Louis XII of France.

00:32.298 --> 00:34.633
The king is a man
without fault.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.069
Perhaps, were you not
to meet his wife...

00:37.136 --> 00:39.004
He wants an annulment.
Uh-huh.

00:39.072 --> 00:40.873
This is where the game turns.

00:40.907 --> 00:42.908
CESARE: What happened before
belongs in the past.

00:42.976 --> 00:44.610
You can go off and
love your husband,

00:44.677 --> 00:46.411
and I can go off and
find myself a bride.

00:47.847 --> 00:49.781
I'm sorry.
I cannot.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.484
Maybe our love has to
be more of the soul.

00:52.519 --> 00:55.153
FERDINAND: Your daughter
is married to my kinsman.

00:55.188 --> 00:56.688
And she has a son already

00:56.756 --> 00:58.557
whose father is unknown.

00:58.591 --> 01:00.626
CESARE: To separate a
mother from her child...

01:00.693 --> 01:02.861
I am careful of myself
and my family.

01:02.996 --> 01:04.897
Your sister marries Naples.

01:04.931 --> 01:06.865

marry France?

<i>You hold the fate</i>

01:09.102 --> 01:11.503

Please join us.

01:11.538 --> 01:13.005
My lord had business in Rome.

01:13.039 --> 01:15.741
He requested an audience.
As do I.

GONZAGA: Consider
the bitch's insanity

lady's war on Rome.

01:19.679 --> 01:23.015
ALEXANDER: You request from us
a decree of annulment.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.751

Infidelity.

Indeed.

03:13.326 --> 03:16.662
He prepares our quarters.

03:25.638 --> 03:28.006
this King will not

03:28.041 --> 03:29.908
This marriage
was your choice.

03:30.009 --> 03:31.476
It was.

03:31.511 --> 03:34.613
And I still
love my husband.

03:34.681 --> 03:37.282
I would not have our love
poisoned with politics.

He is not with us?

04:38.578 --> 04:41.713
No, but he made
a contribution.

04:41.748 --> 04:44.416
Of his own
special kind.

04:53.059 --> 04:59.431
Madame, you know you're
going to have to leave us.

04:59.499 --> 05:00.966
Is that what you want?

05:01.067 --> 05:08.106
No, but your husband...

05:08.174 --> 05:10.342

05:10.409 --> 05:12.244
You are going to have
to go back to him.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.613
But I cannot.
Why not?

05:14.747 --> 05:16.648
Because...

05:16.749 --> 05:20.218
I am the lily of the valley.

05:20.286 --> 05:25.557
And the King hath brought me
to His chambers.

05:25.625 --> 05:30.262
Scandal may be the
prerogative of kings...

05:30.296 --> 05:32.798
But we are
the Pope of Rome.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.967
We have a church to run.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.439

I could exhaust myself

05:57.223 --> 06:00.492
in an account of the Borgia
Pope's licentiousness.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.727
But that would be boring.

06:02.795 --> 06:04.896
Can licentiousness
ever be boring?

06:04.997 --> 06:06.264
[scoffs]

06:06.332 --> 06:08.533
It can be tedious
in the extreme.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.468
As His Holiness
might soon discover.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.274
Tell us what you are proposing.

06:16.342 --> 06:18.844
CATHERINA:
A union.

06:18.911 --> 06:21.413
Of Italian families.

06:21.514 --> 06:24.482
Vitelli, Colonna,
Baglioni, Orsini.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.184
Like the fasci
of the Caesars.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.786
Together, we would
be unbreakable.

06:27.854 --> 06:31.723
[chuckles]
And all that. Under you?

06:31.858 --> 06:34.025
A woman?

06:34.060 --> 06:36.795
[chuckling]

06:36.863 --> 06:38.730
CATHERINA:
I propose myself.

06:38.764 --> 06:41.366
Feel free to propose
yourself, Roberto.

06:41.400 --> 06:44.236
But I have the arms,
the cannon, the castle.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.271
And, unlike you,

06:46.339 --> 06:48.506
my hatred of the Borgia
Pope is public already.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.041
Common knowledge.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.010
This Pope has
an army too -

06:52.044 --> 06:54.412
[chuckles]
We have all seen it at work.

06:54.447 --> 06:57.048
I dispelled it from
beneath these walls.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.617
His son Juan Borgia -

06:58.651 --> 07:00.485
His son,
Cesare Borgia

07:00.553 --> 07:02.687
is nothing like
his brother.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.225
He has vigour, I admit.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.396
But does his father
trust him enough

07:11.430 --> 07:13.398
to grant him
the Papal army?

07:14.967 --> 07:18.470
No, he sends him to France.

07:18.537 --> 07:24.042
So father fights with son,
like two bears in a pit.

07:24.076 --> 07:28.880
And this,
believe me,

07:28.948 --> 07:31.049
this is our moment.

07:32.885 --> 07:39.624
So be with me,
my family, my arms...

07:39.725 --> 07:42.260
Or against me.

07:53.239 --> 07:55.307
ORSINI:
Her rhetoric is persuasive.

07:55.408 --> 07:56.942
BAGLIONI:
As is her plan.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.977
All roads lead to Rome.

07:59.078 --> 08:00.712
And pass through the Romagna.

08:00.780 --> 08:01.913
ORSINI:
Yes Baglioni, yes.

08:01.948 --> 08:04.683
but what if it
is just rhetoric?

08:04.750 --> 08:08.553
What she threatens
means war Orsini.

08:08.621 --> 08:12.791
Perhaps war with
more than Rome.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.328
The Pope's daughter
married Naples.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.596
His son journeys to France.

08:18.631 --> 08:21.499
I say we keep
our co5nsel.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.034
Until he returns...

08:40.385 --> 08:44.522
My Lord Borgia...

08:44.557 --> 08:47.525
You look quite sober
for a Duke.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.494
And you look quite priestly,
for a King.

08:49.628 --> 08:51.629
The King is hunting.

08:51.664 --> 08:54.599
And please do not
take it amiss.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.802
There are diplomatic
niceties to observe.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.672

of a Pope.

10:10.910 --> 10:14.212

shall lead them...

11:50.176 --> 11:52.310

11:52.344 --> 11:54.512
Florence has an

11:55.581 --> 11:57.382
So, tell me...

11:57.416 --> 11:59.350
what do you think
of this one?

11:59.385 --> 12:01.686
Forsake the

12:01.720 --> 12:03.855
Wear the simple black satin.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.523

Why?

12:05.591 --> 12:07.759
They have never

12:07.826 --> 12:09.861

let alone a Borgia.

12:09.895 --> 12:12.530
Italian wealth unsettles them.

12:12.565 --> 12:16.301

it offends their martial nature.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.269

Well...

12:18.370 --> 12:20.171
Black satin it is then.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.173

12:25.444 --> 12:29.247
Do you have advice on anything
other than presentation?

12:29.348 --> 12:31.416
But presentation
is everything.

12:42.861 --> 12:47.599
This King desires
more than Naples.

12:47.633 --> 12:51.302
He has an equal
fondness for Milan.

12:51.403 --> 12:52.971
Ah...

12:53.038 --> 12:54.906
But I didn't say that.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.996
You will be with your
husband soon enough.

13:18.097 --> 13:20.331
It's not weeping for my husband.

13:20.432 --> 13:23.935
It is weeping for my son.

13:23.969 --> 13:27.672
Your brother tells me this King

You have to return

You've been here
too long Madam.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.999
Oh, this is madness -

15:36.902 --> 15:38.836
You say he knows?

15:38.904 --> 15:41.172
He asked me to perform an act -

15:41.240 --> 15:42.940
so heinous and so bloody -

15:43.008 --> 15:44.809
that I could not bear
to contemplate it -

15:47.913 --> 15:49.580
He asked you to
murder the child?

15:49.681 --> 15:53.384
Our child.

15:53.419 --> 15:57.088
So I shall bear you a son,
and you will be sad no longer.

15:57.189 --> 15:58.523

16:13.205 --> 16:14.705
and bring forth a son.

16:17.142 --> 16:21.112
It is the French custom,
Duke Valentino,

16:21.180 --> 16:23.581
to await their
Highnesses' attention,

16:23.649 --> 16:27.084
before bowing low
before them.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.820
Is the Queen
still in residence?

16:28.887 --> 16:30.054
Of course.

16:30.155 --> 16:31.622
The same queen

16:31.690 --> 16:33.791
for whom I carry the
Papal Brief of Annulment?

16:33.793 --> 16:36.127
Not on your person, surely?

16:36.161 --> 16:38.729
In my back pocket.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.299
I shall take care not
to bow too low then.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.135
Otherwise the queen
might see her destiny...

16:44.169 --> 16:47.038
...protruding from
my bastard Borgia arse.

16:53.045 --> 16:55.646
<i>MAJOR-DOMO: Presenting</i>
<i>the Duke of Valentinois,</i>

16:55.681 --> 16:57.748
<i>and the ambassador</i>
<i>of the Holy See,</i>

16:57.816 --> 17:00.585
<i>His Excellency</i>
<i>Cesare Borgia.</i>

17:00.686 --> 17:09.760
[quiet chatter]

17:09.862 --> 17:12.396
Once a Cardinal, I believe.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.568
Indeed I was,
Your Highness.

17:17.669 --> 17:22.473
And now a Duke.
Please explain.

17:22.540 --> 17:28.378
Well, I found the need,
Madame, to divorce myself

17:28.413 --> 17:30.448
from my bride,
the Holy Mother Church.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.050
Ah. Can it be done
that easily?

17:33.185 --> 17:34.585
With difficulty.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.554
And not without
soul-searching.

17:36.588 --> 17:41.592
But with the help of a Papal
Brief, anything is possible.

17:41.693 --> 17:45.296
Well, you are noble now,
after a fashion.

17:47.466 --> 17:50.434
You may kiss my hand.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.937
And you may kiss my cheek.

17:54.473 --> 17:56.240
In the true
French manner.

17:59.378 --> 18:02.680
You are in search of
a bride, I believe?

18:02.714 --> 18:06.350
Among my ladies in waiting?

18:06.385 --> 18:12.957
Carlotta D'Aragona
or Charlotte D'Albret -

18:13.058 --> 18:17.228
or...
no, not for you.

18:19.264 --> 18:23.534
[quiet chatter]

18:23.569 --> 18:25.603
<i>ALEXANDER: If you were</i>
<i>to return to your husband...</i>

18:25.637 --> 18:27.738
Then I must murder
this child -

18:27.806 --> 18:29.273
No...

18:29.374 --> 18:33.010
we would afford
you every support -

18:33.078 --> 18:38.015
in the confinds that are
appropriate to your condition.

18:38.083 --> 18:40.351
Your chambers are more
than appropriate -

18:40.419 --> 18:42.286
No, that is impossible.

18:44.923 --> 18:47.925
We were thinking perhaps -

18:47.993 --> 18:50.127
What?

18:51.830 --> 18:53.331
A Convent.

18:53.432 --> 18:55.733
With the Sisters.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.501
And that is impossible.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.173
I am the Lily of the Valley.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.442
And the King has
taken me to his chambers!

19:12.184 --> 19:18.089
[footsteps]

19:18.123 --> 19:23.461
[drums]

19:23.528 --> 19:27.131
[quiet chatter]

19:27.199 --> 19:32.970
[applause]

19:40.879 --> 19:45.182
The wedding of Alfonso
D'Aragona and Lucrezia Borgia

19:45.217 --> 19:48.552
was more than just a union,
of body and soul.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.989
It was a restoration,
of historic contacts

19:52.024 --> 19:54.659
between Rome and Naples,

19:54.693 --> 19:57.294
between the Vatican and Spain.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.965
So let us raise our glasses,

20:00.999 --> 20:04.001
to the falling
of the French winter

20:04.036 --> 20:07.938
and to the coming
of the true Italian spring.

20:08.006 --> 20:10.007
To harmony between
our states...

20:12.678 --> 20:14.245
And to this new family,

20:14.312 --> 20:16.514
that we welcome into
our bosom, as our own.

20:18.650 --> 20:20.451
I have a child,
Your Highness,

20:20.519 --> 20:23.054
who must someday
hear those words.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.724
[murmuring]

20:26.858 --> 20:28.192
A child, you say?

20:28.226 --> 20:31.996
I seem to remember
one, yes.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.364
How odd.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.534
And is this child
your husband's?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.270
If he is mine, he is
my husbands, surely.

20:43.008 --> 20:48.245
We would welcome any
fruit of your union.

20:48.280 --> 20:52.616
Meanwhile, all other
fruit is best forgotten.

20:52.718 --> 20:56.387
As if it never existed.

20:56.455 --> 20:59.623
So let us drink,
once again,

20:59.691 --> 21:01.125
to the harmony
between our states.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.560
ALL:
Harmony!

21:02.594 --> 21:06.030
To this family, that
we welcome as our own.

21:07.866 --> 21:19.643
[chatter continues]

21:23.381 --> 21:29.854
[music and chatter]

21:29.856 --> 21:37.228
[music and chatter]

21:38.797 --> 21:40.998
This Queen is
actually quite comely.

21:41.099 --> 21:43.033
But barren.

21:43.101 --> 21:46.637
The King will be
rid of her.

21:46.738 --> 21:48.139
I am aware you come here

21:48.173 --> 21:51.275
bearing one, quite
significant, gift.

21:51.309 --> 21:55.813
And I am aware that this gift
will not be given cheaply.

21:55.881 --> 21:59.550
It may not, Archbishop,
be given at all.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.352
Then, I would propose
myself

22:01.419 --> 22:04.021
as a facilitator
in this matter.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.223
You need
a well-borne bride.

22:06.258 --> 22:08.392
The least of my needs.

22:08.426 --> 22:10.795
Then let me guess
the others.

22:10.829 --> 22:14.965
A French Duchy for the
newly-made Duke deValentino?

22:15.000 --> 22:19.436
One of the more ancient titles,
to banish the arriviste odour?

22:19.504 --> 22:22.339
Ah, do I smell, then?

22:22.407 --> 22:24.942
Only of expensive
Italian perfume.

22:24.976 --> 22:28.412
The Order of the
Golden Rose, perhaps?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.782
The most prestigious the
French King can bestow?

22:31.817 --> 22:33.117
That would indeed be welcome.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.319
And...

22:35.353 --> 22:39.423
French support for your
father's Italian adventures?

22:39.457 --> 22:42.760
What I need most of all,
Cardinal,

22:42.828 --> 22:45.162
is an army.

22:45.263 --> 22:47.097
An army?

22:47.132 --> 22:51.969
Horse, cannon, infantry,
savoliere lancers.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.804
An army.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.473
An army that can
cut through Italy

22:56.541 --> 22:59.009
like a knife through butter.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.013
You called me Cardinal.

23:03.148 --> 23:04.849
I did indeed.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.452
A little premature,
perhaps, Archbishop.

23:08.486 --> 23:11.989
But a Papal Brief
is not the only gift...

23:12.057 --> 23:14.124
in my gift...

23:14.159 --> 23:16.827
Is this what you
French call dancing?

23:16.895 --> 23:26.570
[♪]

23:26.671 --> 23:28.405
Your Highness.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.208
Not her.

23:31.309 --> 23:33.010
She is properly noble.

23:33.044 --> 23:36.881
For you, the bastard child
of a minor aristocrat.

23:36.948 --> 23:38.849
You are too kind,
Madame...

23:38.917 --> 23:40.417
I am.

23:40.485 --> 23:42.519
My husband has often
remarked upon the very fact.

23:42.587 --> 23:44.154
Your husband is also kind.

23:44.189 --> 23:47.224
My husband smells.
Of horse manure, and the hunt.

23:47.325 --> 23:51.729
If you could persuade
him to bathe more often,

23:51.763 --> 23:54.832
I might find you
a better bride.

23:54.866 --> 23:56.367
I will do my utmost,
Madame.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.768
And if he comes to you
smelling of roses,

23:57.869 --> 23:59.370
my reward is?

23:59.437 --> 24:01.171
A Duchess, perhaps.

24:01.239 --> 24:05.276
Legitimate, maybe.

24:05.343 --> 24:07.611
Here, try this one,

24:07.712 --> 24:11.582
Charlotte D'Albret.

24:11.716 --> 24:13.550
She hates me.

24:13.585 --> 24:16.387
She must.
She recommended you to me.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.822
Ah, so she hates
you too?

24:18.890 --> 24:20.591
CESARE:
She hates us both.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.894
Hardly a reason for
courtship, surely.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.530
But I come with some
admirable qualities.

24:26.564 --> 24:28.766
So I have heard.

24:28.800 --> 24:33.570
And what do you demand of
marriage, Cesare Borgia?

24:33.638 --> 24:36.540
CESARE: A title.
An heir. A dowry.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.178
CHARLOTTE: What about
everlasting love?

24:41.246 --> 24:42.713
CESARE:
Of course. That too.

24:42.747 --> 24:44.148
How could I forget?

24:44.215 --> 24:46.283
What do you ask of it,
Charlotte D'Albert?

24:46.318 --> 24:47.885
CHARLOTTE:
A child.

24:47.919 --> 24:49.553
I would have a husband

24:49.587 --> 24:52.790
whose physique promises
he is handsome.

24:52.857 --> 24:55.926
CESARE:
And what of everlasting love?

24:56.027 --> 24:58.696
I'm glad you reminded me.
That too.

24:58.763 --> 25:00.431
But Rome.

25:00.465 --> 25:03.300
I am not sure
I could live in Rome.

25:03.401 --> 25:06.537
All that heat,
that conspiracy.

25:06.604 --> 25:08.706
CESARE:
You will not have to.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.874
CHARLOTTE:
Are we married already?

25:13.578 --> 25:15.546
[giggles]

25:17.449 --> 25:19.416
[applause]

25:19.551 --> 25:21.151
[hounds barking]

25:21.252 --> 25:23.654
[men shouting]

25:30.895 --> 25:32.496
[horse whinnies]

25:32.597 --> 25:34.131
[boar squeals]

25:46.344 --> 25:49.446
[distant shouts]

26:02.494 --> 26:05.295
They went that way -

26:05.363 --> 26:07.264
Should I care?

26:07.365 --> 26:10.334
The noble hunts the boar.

26:10.368 --> 26:14.872
The peasant scratches
the grass.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.807
But they both must eat,
surely.

26:16.841 --> 26:19.209
They must.

26:19.310 --> 26:22.646
You should mind
where he grazes.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.114
It is just grass...

26:24.182 --> 26:25.749
Those ferns.

26:25.817 --> 26:27.818
They hide the Galerina.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.297
This tiny bolus
could kill a horse.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.368
You have a use for it?

26:44.469 --> 26:47.004
I have a use for everything.

26:47.138 --> 26:49.373
Some kill, some cure.

26:49.441 --> 26:51.708
Each has its moment.

26:51.843 --> 26:53.343
On your way, my lady...

26:53.411 --> 26:55.312
Kill that boar...

26:59.184 --> 27:01.218
[horse whinnies]

27:19.671 --> 27:21.271
Tell us.

27:21.372 --> 27:24.074
She is not with child.

27:26.444 --> 27:29.379
So...

27:29.514 --> 27:32.382
She is deranged?

27:36.888 --> 27:38.555
Entirely without reason?

27:38.590 --> 27:40.257
She is deranged.

27:40.358 --> 27:42.226
But not without reason.

27:42.293 --> 27:44.728
She was with child.

27:44.762 --> 27:48.732
The child was cut from her.
<i>Most cruelly.</i>

27:48.766 --> 27:50.868
Her womb is scarred
<i>forever.</i>

27:50.935 --> 27:52.870
And the event
has unhinged her.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.740
<i>[Alexander exhales sharply]</i>

28:00.445 --> 28:04.248
So what is to be done?

28:04.282 --> 28:06.884
For her body,
or her mind?

28:09.420 --> 28:11.588
For her soul.

28:11.723 --> 28:13.490
Rest.

28:13.591 --> 28:15.592
Tranquillity.

28:15.727 --> 28:17.761
Prayer.

28:30.408 --> 28:33.143
Have you ever had a child,
Micheletto?

28:33.178 --> 28:36.013
No, my lady.
I have none.

28:36.114 --> 28:38.448
But if you had?

28:38.483 --> 28:42.553
Then I would bind him to me
with hoops of steel.

28:42.620 --> 28:45.422
And I would love them
till death and beyond.

28:48.359 --> 28:50.827
And I would make all tremble
who tried to come between us.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.963
[distant chatters and cheers]

28:55.200 --> 28:57.201
So you have a heart.

28:57.268 --> 28:58.869
<i>I must have.</i>

29:01.306 --> 29:03.607
It is the thought
of the child

29:03.641 --> 29:05.842
being kept from you,
it's mother,

29:05.944 --> 29:07.811
that makes it break.

29:17.021 --> 29:18.989
Bullseye!
Yes!

29:19.023 --> 29:24.161
If, God forbid,
this King were to die,

29:24.195 --> 29:26.396
who would succeed him?

29:26.497 --> 29:28.765
Your husband?

29:28.833 --> 29:32.169
He is but a cousin,
on the mother's side.

29:32.203 --> 29:35.439
<i>This King is strong,</i>
<i>My Lady.</i>

29:35.506 --> 29:37.341
<i>His father</i>
<i>lived a long life.</i>

29:37.375 --> 29:39.977
He will be with us
for a long time.

29:40.011 --> 29:43.180
Until my son
is a boy no longer.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.351
<i>[arrow strikes]</i>

29:52.190 --> 29:53.657
<i>[Ferdinand shouts]</i>
<i>That's why I'm the king!</i>

29:53.725 --> 29:56.593
[laughter]

30:06.571 --> 30:09.539
So, you can free me
of this wife of mine?

30:11.776 --> 30:14.177
Your Highness, I would
do anything to free you.

30:14.212 --> 30:17.247
KING LOUIS:
In return for the annulment -

30:17.282 --> 30:19.416
Charlotte D'Albert is
yours if you desire it.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.184
I do.

30:21.219 --> 30:24.154
KING LOUIS:
The Duchy also is yours.

30:24.222 --> 30:28.191
The Order of the Golden
Rose, yours also.

30:30.862 --> 30:33.563
But, as to the matter
of an army,

30:37.869 --> 30:39.703
For an invasion of Milan,
I would hazard.

30:45.877 --> 30:48.045
Do you read our thoughts?

30:48.079 --> 30:50.147
D'AMBOISE: Before one thinks
of them Your Highness.

30:50.214 --> 30:52.582
This young man
is clairvoyant.

30:52.617 --> 30:55.152
The last French invasion
ended in disaster.

30:55.219 --> 30:56.820
For all concerned.

30:56.854 --> 31:00.724
Maybe if the next was
under Italian leadership...

31:02.527 --> 31:04.227
Yours, I presume.

31:04.329 --> 31:06.863
With the blessing of the
Pope of Rome, of course.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.298
And he would give it?

31:08.366 --> 31:10.100
He would sever
his ties with Naples?

31:10.201 --> 31:11.835
And with Spain?

31:11.869 --> 31:13.770
I would make sure,
Your Highness, that he did.

31:16.441 --> 31:17.607
My God.

31:17.709 --> 31:19.476
What you propose

31:19.544 --> 31:22.913
could shake the foundations
of the Italian city states.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.448
Perhaps.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.416
But it would give you Milan.

31:26.451 --> 31:30.253
And it would
give you an army.

31:30.288 --> 31:33.357
I would have your advice,
Archbishop D'Amboise -

31:35.360 --> 31:37.561
Well you can call him
Cardinal D'Amboise.

31:45.603 --> 31:47.471
Cardinal D'Amboise.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.773

your advice.

31:55.646 --> 31:56.980
You!

31:57.048 --> 32:00.150
You came like a Greek,
bearing gifts.

32:00.218 --> 32:03.453
May that shrew you are to marry
suffocate you with her bile.

32:03.488 --> 32:05.655
May she bear you
a dwarf, a succubus.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.457
And may you rot in
that circle of hell

32:07.492 --> 32:09.793

the Borgia family.

32:09.827 --> 32:13.063
There is no hell.
No heaven either.

32:13.097 --> 32:15.165
This world is what
we make of it.

32:17.835 --> 32:21.304

was to remind you of that fact.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.040

34:04.108 --> 34:07.277
You would poison a whole

No.
