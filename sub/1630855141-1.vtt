00:54.388 --> 00:56.807
<i>We do not know why we are here.</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:08.569
<i>We do not know who built the Silo.</i>

01:18.871 --> 01:24.376
<i>We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.</i>

01:25.711 --> 01:26.920
Good morning, Sheriff.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.132
Hey, Sam. You awake yet?

01:31.425 --> 01:32.801
I'm about halfway there.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.769
<i>We do not know
when it will be safe to go outside.</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:47.149
<i>We only know that day...</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:51.737
<i>is not this day.</i>

02:28.065 --> 02:29.066
Hey.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.150
You're in early.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.320
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.
Got the damn leg cramps.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.531
When you get your coffee,
meet me in holding 3.

02:35.531 --> 02:36.657
Three?

03:13.652 --> 03:15.028
You want some coffee?

03:17.948 --> 03:19.283
What are you doing?

03:19.283 --> 03:20.534
I wanna see her.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.661
No, Sheriff.

03:23.245 --> 03:27.374
I should've done it three years ago.
But I couldn't listen.

03:27.374 --> 03:29.126
Hey. Stop.

03:30.544 --> 03:34.965
Come on out of there.
Let's talk about this.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.594
I made up my mind,
or I wouldn't be in here.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.846
I'm sorry, Sam.

03:42.181 --> 03:45.225
You're gonna say this to me
after all we've been through?

03:45.225 --> 03:46.852
Want me to wait till Sandy gets in?

03:46.852 --> 03:49.563
I don't want you to say it.

03:51.607 --> 03:54.860
Please, Sheriff. Don't say it.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.320
- Deputy Marnes...
- Please, Sheriff.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.529
I wanna go out.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.335
While you get things rolling,
I think I'm gonna lie down.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.129
Are you getting coffee?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.380
I am!

06:20.380 --> 06:24.009
Okay. I'll take milk, please.
Actually, no milk. I don't--

06:24.510 --> 06:26.303
I don't need any milk. No.

06:26.303 --> 06:28.180
- Come on. It's almost 8:00.
- Okay.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.182
- Please.
- Okay, coming.

06:32.476 --> 06:33.477
Thanks.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.146
I don't know why we're doing this.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.607
We're not gonna get it.
We had two tries.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.039
I can't believe it.

06:54.623 --> 06:55.666
Third time's a charm.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.709
You're just excited to have sex every day.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.545
Hey, you could be pregnant
a month from now.

06:59.545 --> 07:01.171
Please let it be more than that.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.719
You know I love you no matter what.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.931
Shut up. We're doing this. Let's go.

07:11.682 --> 07:14.101
Allie,
his office doesn't open for an hour.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.853
Yeah. Well, we can get some breakfast.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.437
We can talk about baby names.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.190
Which will be me just humoring you,
because obviously,

07:20.190 --> 07:22.234
if I'm giving birth
to this little critter,

07:22.234 --> 07:24.194
I'm naming it whatever the hell I want.

07:26.071 --> 07:27.072
Okay.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.585
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.171
- Congratulations.
- Yeah. Thank you.

07:42.171 --> 07:43.255
Thanks.

07:46.008 --> 07:46.925
Hi.

07:47.426 --> 07:48.343
Hi. Congrats.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.013
Hi.

07:54.725 --> 07:56.602
I really hate this part.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.270
People are just happy for us.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.856
I just wish everyone didn't know.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.026
Oh, shit.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.236
Sheriff, Mrs. Becker.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.280
I don't mean to intrude.

08:08.280 --> 08:09.489
So don't.

08:10.282 --> 08:12.743
There's your famous
tell-it-like-it-is manner.

08:12.743 --> 08:13.911
Why everyone likes you.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.954
If everyone likes me,
I'm not doing my job.

08:17.915 --> 08:21.335
Mrs. Becker, your husband might not be
interested in what I have to say--

08:21.335 --> 08:22.753
What I'd be really interested in

08:22.753 --> 08:24.922
- is you leaving us alone, Gloria.
- Holston.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.257
But whatever our sheriff
may have told you,

08:27.257 --> 08:29.051
I provide fertility counseling--

08:29.051 --> 08:30.761
Oh, yeah? Like what?

08:31.345 --> 08:33.138
Your husband's waiting for me
to say something

08:33.138 --> 08:35.265
I'm not legally allowed to say.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.643
- Such as?
- Clever.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.729
I have no desire to be sent out.
Thank you, Sheriff.

08:41.855 --> 08:45.859
Mrs. Becker, if you have an open mind,
come see me.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.071
I wish you both the very best.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.659
What does she do exactly?

08:53.659 --> 08:56.036
She goes right to the edge
of promising people a baby

08:56.036 --> 08:59.122
if they do what she says, which is fraud.
And it's cruel.

09:07.673 --> 09:09.049
I'll let that go numb.

09:10.801 --> 09:16.515
Now, after I remove the birth control,
it'll take two to three weeks

09:16.515 --> 09:17.975
for your hormones to reset.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.727
Now, that said, some couples
do become pregnant

09:20.727 --> 09:22.229
within days of getting clearance.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.022
But then, you know all this.

09:24.022 --> 09:25.858
Is this your second time?

09:26.733 --> 09:28.151
- Third.
- And last.

09:28.652 --> 09:30.320
I'm almost thirty-eight.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.283
Can you feel this?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.285
Just pressure.

09:36.285 --> 09:40.455
Well, even though you're numb,
it's still gonna feel weird.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.917
We make sure
the capsule's implanted quite deep

09:45.294 --> 09:47.212
so it never gives you any trouble.

09:48.630 --> 09:52.509
But not for long, as I am done.

09:54.178 --> 09:55.220
And there it is.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.639
You are no longer under birth control.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.728
You are now free to make a baby.

10:14.531 --> 10:16.533
Thank you, Mrs. Flores.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.995
I swear if one more person
congratulates us...

10:20.621 --> 10:22.122
Impregnate me. Now.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.123
Yes, ma'am.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.085
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

10:27.794 --> 10:28.795
Remember last time?

10:28.795 --> 10:31.381
At some point,
this is gonna start feeling like work.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.591
Best work ever.

10:41.558 --> 10:44.478
We tried, like, four times
before we finally got clearance,

10:44.478 --> 10:45.771
so now's your time.

10:45.771 --> 10:46.855
Yeah, let's hope.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.607
My cousin Charlene,

10:48.607 --> 10:52.110
she convinced her husband
he had to dye his unit blue.

10:52.110 --> 10:53.195
Did it work?

10:53.195 --> 10:54.404
They got pregnant.

10:54.404 --> 10:57.533
But I'm sure his blue dick
had nothing to do with it.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.494
She was just fucking with him.
Gives you a clue to that marriage.

11:00.494 --> 11:02.788
- Hello, Bernard.
- Morning, Bernard.

11:02.788 --> 11:04.498
Karen. Allison.

11:05.624 --> 11:07.584
I see you posted an article

11:07.584 --> 11:10.796
on our BBS about recovering deleted files.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.423
- I did.
- You do know you need to get my approval

11:13.423 --> 11:16.343
for any IT-related content
before it goes wide.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.388
Well, I figured we could cut down
on service calls

11:19.388 --> 11:21.640
if people could handle
some things on their own.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.394
I took it down. Your post.

11:25.394 --> 11:28.438
I have no doubt your intentions were good,

11:28.438 --> 11:31.900
but our reporting structure
is there for a reason.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.151
Got it.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.572
Fucking asshole.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.782
Did you know you were breaking the rules?

11:38.782 --> 11:43.161
No. Maybe. Kind of.

11:44.788 --> 11:46.331
There's too many rules.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.791
Well, you wanted to work in IT.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.711
It's not just IT. It's everywhere.

11:52.880 --> 11:56.175
We blame the rebels
for erasing our history, right?

11:56.175 --> 11:57.426
Yes.

11:57.426 --> 12:00.179
So why can't we ask questions
about that stuff?

12:00.179 --> 12:04.558
And if losing our history is so bad,
why can some goons from Judicial

12:04.558 --> 12:05.934
send you down to the mines

12:05.934 --> 12:08.061
if you happen to have a relic
from the before times?

12:08.061 --> 12:09.146
Allison.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.024
Really?

12:12.024 --> 12:14.151
You're gonna use
your sheriff voice with me?

12:14.902 --> 12:17.613
Honey,
the Pact is the only history we have.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.783
What if a bunch of rule-breakers
decide they wanna see for themselves

12:21.783 --> 12:22.868
what it's like aboveground?

12:23.452 --> 12:26.538
They somehow manage to open that door,
we are done.

12:27.915 --> 12:30.292
Part of my job
is making sure that doesn't happen.

13:05.786 --> 13:06.787
I got my period.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.249
I know. We still have time.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.173
What are you so afraid of?

13:18.173 --> 13:21.802
I'm afraid some drunken, pyromaniac
adolescent with a cherry bomb

13:21.802 --> 13:24.680
is gonna start a fire
that sets off a stampede.

13:25.681 --> 13:27.850
Are you done? Is it safe for me to speak?

13:27.850 --> 13:30.143
Since you've been wearing the sash
and we've been wearing a badge,

13:30.143 --> 13:33.689
Freedom Day has gone off without a hitch.
And that's a long damn time.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.315
All deputies will be on patrol,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.442
and we'll have fire teams
on every tenth level.

13:40.112 --> 13:42.865
It's getting harder to see
with every passing month.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.659
A long time between cleanings
means things are going well.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.619
No one wants a cleaning,

13:49.037 --> 13:51.331
but people need to see
what it's like out there.

14:03.427 --> 14:04.428
Mrs. Becker.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.013
- Hi.
- I was looking for you.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.808
- Are you pregnant?
- Not yet.

14:09.808 --> 14:12.019
But I'm afraid I won't be needing
your assistance.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.270
- Take care.
- Oh, no, no, no.

14:13.270 --> 14:18.650
That's not why I was looking for you.
I'd like to ask you a question in private.

14:25.782 --> 14:29.328
I hate that term, "Freedom Day."
So simplistic.

14:30.120 --> 14:32.623
"Put Down the Rebellion Day"
would be more accurate.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.209
Ma'am, you said you wanted
to ask me a question.

14:38.504 --> 14:39.630
Why'd you do that?

14:39.630 --> 14:41.423
Because I don't want them to hear.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.008
Who?

14:43.509 --> 14:44.968
Well, who's got listeners?

14:45.844 --> 14:46.845
Judicial?

14:51.683 --> 14:56.271
Have you ever wondered
what was on the servers they erased?

14:56.271 --> 15:01.944
In the books they burned?
If it was even the rebels that did it?

15:03.445 --> 15:05.280
- I should get to work.
- Oh, please.

15:05.280 --> 15:06.949
I didn't ask you here on a whim.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.911
I've heard you're someone who also

15:12.120 --> 15:13.121
wonders.

15:15.707 --> 15:16.708
Who told you that?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.669
Why do we live underground?

15:18.669 --> 15:22.214
What actually happened out there?

15:22.798 --> 15:24.675
- I'm going now.
- One last thing.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.055
Do you really think you're the kind of
person they want having children?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.644
Three times with no success?

15:36.228 --> 15:39.606
She just said it--
it started to feel a little intentional.

15:39.606 --> 15:43.402
Okay. Now she has officially descended
from eccentric oddball

15:43.402 --> 15:45.028
to completely fucking crazy.

15:45.696 --> 15:46.822
I should send the psych team

15:46.822 --> 15:49.658
- to pay Gloria a visit.
- Don't. She just--

15:49.658 --> 15:52.286
Just what? Said something that upsets you?

15:52.286 --> 15:54.788
She and her husband couldn't have a baby.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.790
She wants you to find out why.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.751
You had your birth control removed, Allie.

16:00.252 --> 16:04.631
We have the same shot at making a baby
as anyone who has clearance.

16:05.841 --> 16:07.509
- Okay?
- Okay.

16:19.438 --> 16:20.772
You're not gonna like this.

16:20.772 --> 16:24.902
Our buddy George submitted another ticket.
Guess whose turn it is to take it.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.702
He's a programmer in the Mids
with a repair stall in the market.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.788
- Why do you have to go?
- Everybody's taking off for Freedom Day.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.958
And because you're working,
I figured I would just be on call.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.960
But he wants me to be there
first thing in the morning,

16:41.960 --> 16:44.963
which means I have to go down tonight
and get a room in the hostel.

16:44.963 --> 16:49.927
Also means that we will be missing
this evening's entertainment.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.599
- Honey.
- I know. I'll be quiet.

16:56.558 --> 16:58.393
- Not here.
- Yeah, here.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.354
- Honey. Marnes is--
- Let's be quick.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.438
Okay.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
It's okay. It's okay.

17:31.093 --> 17:32.094
Holy shit.

17:33.387 --> 17:36.139
If I don't get pregnant
from that, I never will.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.829
We'll beat you to the top
and open the door to the outside,

17:58.829 --> 18:01.707
letting all the poison into the Silo!

18:04.168 --> 18:05.419
Not so fast, rebel!

18:05.419 --> 18:08.422
In the name of the Founders!

19:22.204 --> 19:23.288
Allison Becker?

19:23.288 --> 19:24.540
I am. You must be--

19:24.540 --> 19:27.000
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

19:34.424 --> 19:36.885
Sorry about getting you down here
on Freedom Day.

19:36.885 --> 19:39.847
I'm on call. My husband's working, so...

19:39.847 --> 19:41.849
That's what I figured,
him being the sheriff.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.308
Why I thought I might get you.

19:44.643 --> 19:47.688
I don't understand. How can I help you?

19:48.313 --> 19:51.733
Yeah. I read your post
on how to retrieve deleted files.

19:52.276 --> 19:56.321
I had a feeling it wouldn't stay up long,
so I printed it.

19:57.573 --> 20:00.701
- That must have cost you a fortune.
- Yeah, worth every credit.

20:00.701 --> 20:01.952
It got me a long way.

20:03.203 --> 20:07.207
But I needed to see you in person,
so I put in a repair request

20:07.207 --> 20:08.500
hoping I'd get you.

20:08.500 --> 20:12.087
Of course, they sent everyone but you.
So then I thought with the holiday--

20:12.087 --> 20:13.547
Why didn't you just ask for me?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.591
I didn't wanna arouse suspicion.

20:16.842 --> 20:17.843
From who?

20:17.843 --> 20:19.553
Who wrote the law on relics?

20:20.304 --> 20:22.264
You're worried about Judicial?

20:22.973 --> 20:23.974
Isn't everybody?

20:25.434 --> 20:26.602
Is this about a relic?

20:26.602 --> 20:28.270
That's just it. I don't know.

20:30.939 --> 20:34.067
A guy came in with this

20:35.027 --> 20:36.486
about a year ago.

20:37.946 --> 20:40.782
Said he found it
under the carpet in a closet.

20:41.909 --> 20:44.494
I fired it up,
and it looked like it was empty.

20:45.078 --> 20:47.581
Then I tried what you posted...

20:49.917 --> 20:54.713
and I was able to check the memory.

20:58.800 --> 21:03.847
It says most of the drive is in use,
but I can't find any files.

21:05.098 --> 21:08.018
There's something on there.
I just don't know how to get to it.

21:08.018 --> 21:10.354
Could just be old family recipes.

21:10.354 --> 21:13.524
Then they're very old family recipes.

21:14.733 --> 21:15.984
I checked the log in IT.

21:16.818 --> 21:18.737
There's no record of this serial number.

21:19.738 --> 21:23.158
Course,
the log starts after the rebellion.

21:23.158 --> 21:25.869
You think this drive
is over 140 years old?

21:25.869 --> 21:28.997
That's impossible. All the drives
were destroyed in the rebellion.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.415
Could just be an entry error.

21:32.459 --> 21:34.628
Or not.

21:38.549 --> 21:42.469
It might be as simple as just figuring out
the name on the directory.

21:42.469 --> 21:43.554
May I?

21:45.097 --> 21:46.598
Is there anything I can--

21:46.598 --> 21:48.392
Not talking would be great.

21:59.862 --> 22:02.447
- Happy Freedom Day.
- Happy Freedom Day, Mayor.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.866
Very nice to see you all.

22:36.398 --> 22:38.650
Any idea what the 18 means?

22:38.650 --> 22:39.735
Uh-uh.

22:44.239 --> 22:48.368
- Do you have a magnifying glass?
- Yep.

23:07.638 --> 23:08.889
Six minutes

23:09.473 --> 23:11.141
and six seconds

23:11.850 --> 23:13.477
past six o'clock

23:14.144 --> 23:15.687
on this day

23:16.188 --> 23:19.650
140 years ago.

23:19.650 --> 23:24.321
That is the moment
we regained our freedom.

23:27.699 --> 23:30.786
We are gathered on the anniversary

23:31.328 --> 23:34.081
to remember the terror of the rebellion.

23:35.123 --> 23:36.959
If they had succeeded,

23:36.959 --> 23:40.838
if they had opened the door
to the outside world,

23:40.838 --> 23:44.258
none of us would be here right now.

23:45.717 --> 23:49.763
They didn't succeed, thank the Founders.

23:49.763 --> 23:53.475
But they did manage
to take away our history.

23:53.475 --> 23:55.060
Got anything more powerful?

23:55.686 --> 23:57.312
That's as powerful as they get.

23:59.022 --> 24:00.399
It's letters, but--

24:02.484 --> 24:04.152
I think it says "library."

24:06.613 --> 24:09.199
<i>They destroyed our computer drives.</i>

24:09.783 --> 24:16.206
They shredded our files
and burned all the books in our libraries.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.930
But they were stopped.

24:32.556 --> 24:36.476
Our heroic forebears won the day.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.443
Look at this.

24:50.532 --> 24:51.533
I won't.

24:52.534 --> 24:53.535
You shouldn't either.

24:54.286 --> 24:55.787
You should bury this.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.165
Bury it? Are you kidding?
This is the great--

24:58.165 --> 25:01.460
This is a relic.
It's against the law to even have it.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.795
But this could be the key
to everything we don't know.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.840
- We have to look--
- They can send you out to clean for this.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.760
Are you gonna tell your husband?

25:10.677 --> 25:11.678
Just get rid of it.

25:30.489 --> 25:32.616
<i>And their great victory</i>

25:33.200 --> 25:36.745
<i>should be celebrated with cheers.</i>

25:53.804 --> 25:57.766
It should be celebrated with horns.

26:13.198 --> 26:14.783
Where the hell does that go?

26:28.672 --> 26:33.552
And it should be remembered in silence.

26:55.240 --> 26:59.119
<i>Hear the sound that rings</i>

26:59.119 --> 27:01.830
<i>It's calling us</i>

27:01.830 --> 27:05.918
<i>To our duty</i>

27:05.918 --> 27:09.421
<i>Hear the voices sing</i>

27:09.421 --> 27:12.508
<i>So loud and proud</i>

27:12.508 --> 27:16.303
<i>Praise freedom's beauty</i>

27:16.303 --> 27:20.516
<i>See the rising lights</i>

27:24.353 --> 27:28.732
<i>Long night, rise up...</i>

27:40.285 --> 27:42.955
Sorry. I'm just--

27:43.956 --> 27:46.083
I'm just really exhausted from that climb.

27:47.709 --> 27:50.879
I think if I didn't sit
on my ass all day, I'd be more fit.

27:53.674 --> 27:54.675
It's okay.

27:56.802 --> 27:58.053
Just saying I'm tired.

27:59.096 --> 28:00.097
Yeah.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.559
Are you 70-levels tired,

28:03.559 --> 28:04.643
or are you...

28:06.770 --> 28:07.896
tired?

28:10.732 --> 28:12.025
We still have some time.

28:12.568 --> 28:14.444
This can't be fun for you anymore.

28:15.279 --> 28:16.572
It's not about fun.

28:19.032 --> 28:20.450
I wanna have a baby.

28:23.579 --> 28:24.580
So did I.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.609
How'd it go with George?

28:54.818 --> 28:55.861
Couldn't help him.

28:56.862 --> 28:58.113
I think he's just lonely.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.407
Wants to converse
with other computer geeks.

29:06.079 --> 29:08.749
You know, I don't know
if it's something I ate

29:08.749 --> 29:12.044
or if I'm catching a cold,
but I don't feel great.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.004
Then go home. I'll tell Bernard.

29:15.839 --> 29:16.924
Thanks.

29:19.843 --> 29:20.928
Feel better soon.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.086
Come in.

30:00.342 --> 30:01.552
I hoped you'd be back.

30:02.344 --> 30:04.304
Why wouldn't they want us
to have children?

30:18.902 --> 30:23.115
- Bernard behaving himself?
- I didn't see him.

30:27.494 --> 30:30.330
I think I'm gonna take tomorrow off.
Go to the market.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.666
What do you need? I can send a porter.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.710
I just wanna look.

30:35.210 --> 30:36.628
Get some exercise.

30:37.212 --> 30:38.589
Take my mind off...

30:40.924 --> 30:43.468
Sure. Yeah.

30:43.468 --> 30:45.053
Sounds like a good idea.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.120
I wanna see everything.

31:28.013 --> 31:29.515
My brain is fried.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.440
Needless to say, we shouldn't tell
anybody about this.

31:38.982 --> 31:40.025
Needless to say.

31:41.944 --> 31:43.111
When can you come back?

31:43.612 --> 31:44.613
I don't know.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.119
What's this?

31:53.413 --> 31:54.581
I don't know.

31:55.332 --> 31:56.333
Last one?

32:29.032 --> 32:30.200
Hey! Keep right.

32:55.434 --> 32:56.435
It's late.

32:57.269 --> 32:58.562
I lost track.

32:58.562 --> 33:02.065
You go on a shopping spree?
Spend all our credits?

33:02.065 --> 33:04.526
Oh, yeah. I wish. Next time.

33:24.922 --> 33:27.216
I got a message from the doctor.

33:27.216 --> 33:29.676
The only time he can see us is at 11:00.

33:30.761 --> 33:35.182
But, you never know.
We technically still have a few hours.

33:35.182 --> 33:36.517
That's fine.

33:36.517 --> 33:39.520
I'm gonna sleep in a little,
so I'll meet you there.

33:45.484 --> 33:48.362
Hey. Are you okay?

33:50.405 --> 33:51.406
No.

33:52.491 --> 33:53.700
But I will be.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.574
- Hey, Karen.
- Hey.

34:35.576 --> 34:36.577
Where's Allison?

34:38.036 --> 34:41.039
She sent a note by porter
saying she wasn't feeling well.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.793
- Thanks.
- Sure.

34:58.140 --> 34:59.308
We need to talk.

35:01.685 --> 35:03.187
- What's going on?
- Sit.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.650
- Are you okay?
- Sit, please.

35:17.576 --> 35:18.911
I was gonna talk to you last night,

35:18.911 --> 35:22.497
but I wasn't sure you were gonna
be able to hear what I had to say.

35:23.624 --> 35:25.334
You don't always listen, honey.

35:26.877 --> 35:27.920
What are you talking about?

35:27.920 --> 35:29.922
- I always listen--
- Talking is not listening.

35:32.257 --> 35:37.554
Because you're the lawman,
I figured I needed to give you some proof.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.641
Proof of what?

35:41.642 --> 35:43.727
I can't tell you how I know this, but...

35:45.103 --> 35:47.272
they were never gonna
let us have children.

35:47.272 --> 35:49.316
- What?
- We--

35:51.318 --> 35:54.863
I'm not the type of person
they want having kids.

35:55.572 --> 35:56.615
Who's "they"?

35:56.615 --> 35:59.034
The enforcers of the Pact.

35:59.034 --> 36:03.038
They want docile, obedient people.

36:05.332 --> 36:07.793
I saw Dr. Leonard
take out your birth control.

36:07.793 --> 36:10.379
- No, you didn't.
- I was there.

36:10.379 --> 36:11.839
He was behind a curtain.

36:11.839 --> 36:14.007
- You didn't see what he was doing.
- Allison--

36:14.007 --> 36:16.218
I can assure you,

36:17.803 --> 36:19.721
he didn't take out my birth control.

36:20.264 --> 36:21.473
How do you know that?

36:21.974 --> 36:23.475
Because I just did.

36:32.025 --> 36:33.277
What did you do?

36:36.029 --> 36:38.407
Keep pressure on it and don't move.

36:47.666 --> 36:48.792
Hey.

36:53.714 --> 36:54.715
Hey.

37:07.394 --> 37:08.770
- You gotta come.
- What?

37:08.770 --> 37:10.355
It's Allison.

37:11.231 --> 37:13.317
- Good. Sheriff!
- I can't. Allison's hurt.

37:13.317 --> 37:14.860
Allison's in the cafeteria.

37:18.322 --> 37:22.409
None of this is real. Do you see?

37:23.160 --> 37:26.038
They wanna keep you in here,
so they're lying to you.

37:26.038 --> 37:29.958
It's green out there. There's green trees.
There's blue skies.

37:30.792 --> 37:33.295
There's things flying in the air.

37:34.338 --> 37:35.714
Is no one listening to me?

37:36.840 --> 37:38.008
They're keeping us here.

37:38.008 --> 37:40.385
- This display is a lie.
- Allison.

37:40.385 --> 37:43.555
- Allison. Come with me.
- They want us to-- No.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.015
- Listen to me.
- We tried--

37:45.015 --> 37:48.310
- We tried three times. I know it's hard.
- I'm not crazy!

37:48.310 --> 37:50.687
- Why are you treating me like I'm crazy?
- Of course not.

37:50.687 --> 37:53.607
Allison, I've known several patients
who have had breakdowns.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.984
I'm not having a breakdown.

37:55.984 --> 37:57.236
You are bleeding, honey.

37:57.236 --> 37:58.904
- And you need to come--
- No!

37:59.613 --> 38:04.701
No. Just-- I've been thinking
about this a lot, okay?

38:05.410 --> 38:09.915
Please. Just know there's no other way.

38:11.875 --> 38:13.085
I'm sorry, honey.

38:14.378 --> 38:15.879
It's okay.

38:16.588 --> 38:18.465
- It's okay.
- I want to go out!

38:28.684 --> 38:29.935
I want to go out.

38:32.437 --> 38:33.438
Oh, God.

39:06.430 --> 39:08.765
- There has to be something.
- There isn't.

39:08.765 --> 39:12.978
We could say she was distressed
or that she misspoke or people misheard.

39:13.604 --> 39:16.982
There were people there.
They heard what they heard.

39:16.982 --> 39:19.484
- Maybe we could--
- We can bribe them, kill them.

39:19.484 --> 39:20.652
No, goddamn it.

39:21.904 --> 39:26.033
The Pact says you can request a hearing
if you feel you have been misheard.

39:26.033 --> 39:28.035
Allison does not feel she was misheard.

39:28.869 --> 39:30.871
Don't you want to at least
look at the possibility?

39:30.871 --> 39:32.414
Of course I do!

39:33.498 --> 39:37.252
Don't you think I've gone over it again
and again? There is nothing I can do.

39:42.424 --> 39:46.136
If you boil the Pact down to one rule,

39:46.762 --> 39:51.475
it's do not say you want to go outside
or you will fucking go outside.

39:57.272 --> 40:01.985
Did anyone else play a part
in this? Steer her in this direction?

40:01.985 --> 40:07.407
She talked to a fertility counselor on 17.
Gloria Hildebrandt.

40:07.407 --> 40:08.992
And what did she say?

40:08.992 --> 40:10.953
She admits she put the bug
in Allison's ear

40:10.953 --> 40:14.081
about us not being the kind
they want having kids.

40:14.081 --> 40:15.249
<i>Who's "they?"</i>

40:15.249 --> 40:16.416
<i>She doesn't know.</i>

40:16.416 --> 40:19.461
<i>She's just mad
she and her husband couldn't have kids.</i>

40:19.461 --> 40:21.088
Do your talking at the station.

40:21.088 --> 40:25.300
<i>We also hauled up the guy
from the marketplace, George Wilkins.</i>

40:25.300 --> 40:27.511
<i>He runs a computer repair stall.</i>

40:27.511 --> 40:30.305
<i>Allison gave him tech support
on the holiday.</i>

40:30.305 --> 40:35.769
She went shopping yesterday.
I thought maybe she'd gone to see him.

40:35.769 --> 40:38.522
<i>But Wilkins said
that Allison never came back.</i>

40:39.231 --> 40:43.861
<i>A Judicial team searched his stall,
but they didn't find anything.</i>

40:45.153 --> 40:46.446
<i>Then why?</i>

40:48.490 --> 40:51.118
Allison feels things strongly.

40:52.995 --> 40:55.163
But not being able to have a baby...

40:57.499 --> 41:01.461
I think it was just too much.

41:07.467 --> 41:11.388
Holston, you don't have
to be here for the rest.

41:12.806 --> 41:13.807
I'm the sheriff.

41:13.807 --> 41:15.434
Sure you don't want to step aside?

41:16.393 --> 41:19.354
- I took an oath when I took the job.
- I know, but everyone will--

41:19.354 --> 41:22.858
What's the value of swearing an oath
if you only stick to it when it's easy?

41:28.864 --> 41:30.741
Two-day holiday, except for essential.

41:32.034 --> 41:34.328
Open rooms Up Top for visitors.

41:34.328 --> 41:38.874
We expect this'll attract a larger crowd
than usual, as it's been a while.

41:38.874 --> 41:42.336
We'll hold a lottery
for attendance in the cafeteria.

42:00.395 --> 42:01.647
I'm so sorry.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.234
Me too.

42:09.446 --> 42:10.948
I didn't go all crazy.

42:10.948 --> 42:13.242
You cut something out of your body
with a knife.

42:13.784 --> 42:15.953
Yeah, and it hurt like hell.

42:20.082 --> 42:22.334
I took the capsule back to Dr. Leonard.

42:22.334 --> 42:23.794
Oh, yeah? What'd he say?

42:23.794 --> 42:27.881
It was in there to hold a spot,
prevent infection.

42:27.881 --> 42:29.132
Something like that, right?

42:34.429 --> 42:35.639
Doesn't matter.

42:39.935 --> 42:41.603
I have to tell you something.

42:43.272 --> 42:44.773
But I need you to sit close.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.693
- I don't want anybody to hear.
- We're alone.

42:48.277 --> 42:49.278
Please.

42:51.321 --> 42:52.322
Please.

43:04.126 --> 43:06.920
First of all, I love you.

43:06.920 --> 43:12.467
- That is the most important thing.
- Is it?

43:13.051 --> 43:16.180
I know you're angry. I would be too.

43:19.183 --> 43:24.188
If I could wind back the clock
and not know what I know, I would.

43:25.063 --> 43:26.398
In a heartbeat.

43:29.484 --> 43:33.739
But what I found out,
what they told us isn't true.

43:34.907 --> 43:38.493
Why we're here,
what happened 140 years ago,

43:38.493 --> 43:41.622
why and who gets to have children.
And that's not even the big thing--

43:41.622 --> 43:42.706
So?

43:43.624 --> 43:45.334
- So?
- You find out something like that,

43:45.334 --> 43:49.296
you bring it to me, to Mayor Jahns,
to Judicial.

43:49.296 --> 43:50.881
You let everyone in the Silo know.

43:50.881 --> 43:55.302
What you don't do is say the words
that get you sent out there to die.

43:55.302 --> 44:00.140
But that's the big thing I found out.
I won't die out there.

44:00.140 --> 44:06.104
Listen, they have the ability
to change what we see on the screens.

44:06.104 --> 44:08.524
In the cafeteria,
throughout the Silo, everywhere.

44:08.524 --> 44:10.651
- What are you talking about?
- They take an image,

44:10.651 --> 44:12.569
and they alter it somehow.

44:12.569 --> 44:16.865
So, what we see is not what's out there.

44:16.865 --> 44:19.785
It's what they want us
to think is out there.

44:19.785 --> 44:22.037
- What's that? Right there.
- Holston.

44:22.037 --> 44:23.330
And that.

44:23.330 --> 44:25.582
The last three people who cleaned.

44:25.582 --> 44:28.377
Or maybe that's not what it is.

44:28.961 --> 44:32.339
- What if it's just rocks and bushes?
- I know what I'm seeing.

44:32.339 --> 44:35.384
Not if it's just
what the computer wants you to see.

44:35.384 --> 44:37.886
- Why would they do that?
- To keep us in here.

44:39.221 --> 44:40.305
Okay.

44:41.890 --> 44:45.686
If it's so wonderful outside,
why would they not want us to go out?

44:46.436 --> 44:47.563
I don't know.

44:49.690 --> 44:52.401
- I don't know.
- Okay.

44:52.401 --> 44:54.736
But I'm gonna find out. I'm sorry.

44:55.320 --> 44:56.905
- You keep saying that. I--
- Okay.

44:56.905 --> 44:59.032
Just one more thing
I want you to think about,

44:59.032 --> 45:00.325
and then you should get some sleep.

45:02.578 --> 45:03.954
Not going anywhere.

45:06.123 --> 45:07.457
Why do people clean?

45:12.296 --> 45:14.923
To get the dust and grime
off the sensors

45:14.923 --> 45:16.300
- so we can see.
- No.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.385
Why do they go through with it?

45:18.385 --> 45:20.179
Most people swear they're not gonna do it.

45:20.179 --> 45:23.140
When you arrested Brent, he said you'd
have to put a bullet through his head

45:23.140 --> 45:25.601
and throw him down the stairs
'cause he wasn't gonna clean.

45:25.601 --> 45:28.854
- And then what did he do?
- He cleaned.

45:28.854 --> 45:32.566
I think people clean
because they hope somehow

45:33.317 --> 45:38.572
that they can show people the truth
that that is a lie.

45:41.533 --> 45:47.164
When I get out there, if that's what
it's really like, I won't clean.

45:48.665 --> 45:51.627
I'll wave goodbye, because I would have
made the biggest mistake of my life.

45:52.628 --> 45:54.713
But if I'm right

45:55.255 --> 45:58.008
and it's green and lush and beautiful,

45:58.008 --> 46:03.597
I'll pull out my wool
and I'll start to clean. And you'll know.

46:06.141 --> 46:10.562
And then I'll walk over the hill,
and I'll find out what's going on.

46:10.562 --> 46:12.356
And then I'll come back for you.

46:16.026 --> 46:17.027
Okay?

46:35.796 --> 46:37.256
"Allison Becker.

46:38.799 --> 46:42.636
You have been charged with
and convicted of violating

46:42.636 --> 46:45.305
the cardinal law of our society.

46:46.181 --> 46:48.892
Any spoken request
to leave the Silo is granted,

46:50.727 --> 46:52.563
but it is irrevocable.

46:54.815 --> 46:58.402
Once uttered, it is determinative.

47:01.446 --> 47:03.115
You have been asked to clean

47:03.615 --> 47:06.410
and have been provided
with materials to do so.

47:07.244 --> 47:09.746
But you cannot be forced into cleaning.

47:09.746 --> 47:14.209
Once outside the air lock,
you are outside the law."

47:27.472 --> 47:29.391
"We do not know why we are here.

47:32.269 --> 47:34.479
We do not know who built the Silo.

47:36.440 --> 47:40.360
We do not know why everything
outside the Silo is as it is.

47:44.656 --> 47:46.158
We do not know...

47:49.286 --> 47:51.538
when it will be safe to go outside.

47:53.665 --> 47:55.918
We only know that day is not today.

47:57.211 --> 47:59.379
Allison Becker.

48:02.508 --> 48:06.637
On behalf of the people of the Silo,
I hope that you will clean

48:07.429 --> 48:12.893
so that we will better see
the world outside our sanctuary as it is

48:12.893 --> 48:15.062
and thereby be reminded

48:16.063 --> 48:20.567
that here is safe and there is not."

48:24.905 --> 48:26.365
Have you any last words?

48:29.993 --> 48:30.994
I love you.

48:34.289 --> 48:35.499
I love you.

53:00.347 --> 53:01.348
Yes!

54:36.652 --> 54:38.237
Something you should see.

54:38.737 --> 54:42.241
George Wilkins, he's the one Allison
went to help in the marketplace.

54:42.241 --> 54:44.368
- We hauled him up and--
- Yeah, I know who he is.

54:44.368 --> 54:47.204
He got a transfer to Mechanical last year.

54:48.372 --> 54:49.456
Okay.

54:50.791 --> 54:56.588
He's dead. Went over the rail
somewhere around level 120.

54:56.588 --> 54:59.091
Accident? Suicide?

54:59.842 --> 55:00.968
I don't know.

55:02.594 --> 55:05.097
- What does Hank say?
- He didn't say much.

55:05.097 --> 55:06.723
No one saw him go over.

55:08.225 --> 55:10.394
Get to the part you're not telling me.

55:13.981 --> 55:16.692
There's an engineer down there
that says it's murder.

55:37.212 --> 55:38.755
Where's the engineer?

55:40.048 --> 55:40.924
She couldn't make it.

55:41.425 --> 55:45.053
It took us a day to walk down here.
She could have cleared her schedule.

55:45.554 --> 55:46.722
Something came up.

55:52.686 --> 55:53.687
Okay.

56:00.986 --> 56:03.363
Meeting with us isn't optional, Hank.

56:03.363 --> 56:06.450
She says this guy was murdered.
We need to speak to her.

56:06.450 --> 56:07.534
What came up?

56:08.952 --> 56:11.246
The generator. It's been giving her fits.

56:13.165 --> 56:14.249
What does she do?

56:14.249 --> 56:16.752
Well, she pretty much keeps everyone
in the Silo alive.

56:41.026 --> 56:42.027
That's her.

56:43.445 --> 56:44.821
- What's her name?
- What?

56:45.614 --> 56:47.157
What's her name?

56:47.157 --> 56:49.952
Juliette. Juliette Nichols.

57:13.725 --> 57:15.602
<i>What happened
between you and her?</i>

57:18.480 --> 57:20.858
<i>For two years, you were dead inside.</i>

57:23.777 --> 57:25.529
<i>Then you met Juliette Nichols.</i>

57:27.030 --> 57:30.909
- I finally started listening is all.
- To what?

57:31.660 --> 57:36.123
To Allison.
To what she was trying to tell me.

57:37.416 --> 57:39.334
I'm not gonna tell you what that was.

57:39.334 --> 57:43.630
All you need to know is,
I'm gonna go find her.

57:45.090 --> 57:46.341
You want to find her?

57:47.259 --> 57:49.178
She's right there.

57:51.972 --> 57:53.182
I'm sorry.

57:55.767 --> 57:58.228
As much as I love you, you old bastard,

57:59.980 --> 58:01.481
I love Allison more.

58:05.777 --> 58:10.616
If that really is her out there or not,

58:11.783 --> 58:13.577
either way, I'm done.

58:14.703 --> 58:16.622
I've gotta know the truth.
