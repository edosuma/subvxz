00:01.000 --> 00:02.234
<i>Previously on "Alias. "</i>

00:02.235 --> 00:03.369
What about my father?

00:03.370 --> 00:05.870
He knew how badly you wanted to
become field-rated.

00:05.939 --> 00:08.464
And he thought it
was too dangerous,

00:08.541 --> 00:11.237
so he made sure
it didn't happen.

00:12.979 --> 00:15.504
We're going to my facility
in Nevada.

00:15.582 --> 00:16.949
Project: Black Hole.

00:16.950 --> 00:18.584
I've never heard
of Project: Black Hole.

00:18.585 --> 00:21.110
This is everything
the government has collected

00:21.187 --> 00:23.849
on or about Milo Rambaldi
since the 1940s.

00:23.923 --> 00:26.824
A quarter of the artifacts
were collected by you,

00:26.893 --> 00:29.128
and they're also
housed in Nevada.

00:29.129 --> 00:30.763
You had an affair?

00:30.764 --> 00:33.358
It was Irina Derevko.

00:33.433 --> 00:34.600
Sydney's mother.

00:34.601 --> 00:39.800
Are you telling me
Sydney is your daughter?

00:39.873 --> 00:43.775
I never tried to prove it
one way or the other.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074

01:20.513 --> 01:22.448
Sark's on Flight 0028.

01:22.449 --> 01:24.949
It left Chateaudun
Air Force Base 12 hours ago.

01:24.951 --> 01:26.785
They're due to arrive here
in two hours.

01:26.786 --> 01:29.286
We're coordinating with security
to set up a perimeter

01:29.289 --> 01:30.589
- around the airport.
- Good.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.825
The Intelligence Committee
is sending Senator Reed to

01:32.826 --> 01:34.126
oversee the interrogation.

01:34.127 --> 01:36.261
Why the sudden interest
from Washington?

01:36.262 --> 01:37.863
Sark is a key player now.

01:37.864 --> 01:40.492
They expect us to bleed him dry.

01:40.567 --> 01:43.001
Hold on a second.

01:43.002 --> 01:44.369
Robin, Steven.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.870
Connor's dad's here.

01:47.207 --> 01:48.774
- Bye, Dad.
- Later.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.275
Whoa.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.777
Heads.

01:51.778 --> 01:54.278
Dad!
Connor's watching!

01:54.280 --> 01:56.381
Go.

01:56.382 --> 01:57.449
Sorry about that.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.214
All information
concerning Sark's case

02:00.286 --> 02:01.954
is being strictly
compartmentalized

02:01.955 --> 02:03.288
within the task force.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.789
If we have any operational leak
in the next few days,

02:05.825 --> 02:08.193
we're gonna know it came
from inside the Rotunda.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.693
Copy that.

02:36.556 --> 02:37.656
Hey.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.825
- Hey.
- How's it going?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.393
I'm compiling
a list of questions

02:41.394 --> 02:44.591
I plan on asking Sark
during his interrogation.

02:46.032 --> 02:48.532
So, that's it?

02:49.736 --> 02:52.603
Wasn't your father supposed
to arrive like an hour ago?

02:53.239 --> 02:54.706
He went straight into a meeting

02:54.707 --> 02:57.767
with Jack Bristow
and Director Dixon.

02:58.878 --> 03:01.472
Are you gonna be okay
while he's here?

03:01.548 --> 03:04.048
I guess I'm about to find out.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.753
Washington's gone
to great lengths

03:07.754 --> 03:11.281
to secure Mr. Sark's
extradition from the French.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.458
They're expecting results.

03:13.459 --> 03:15.627
And delivering them
will strengthen my case

03:15.628 --> 03:18.063
when the appropriations bill
for your task force

03:18.064 --> 03:20.658
comes before my committee
next month.

03:20.733 --> 03:23.258
We appreciate your effort,
Senator.

03:24.070 --> 03:26.971
Sark's transport will be
arriving at Dover Airfield

03:27.040 --> 03:28.073
within the hour.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.908
Agents Bristow and Weiss
are on site

03:29.909 --> 03:31.310
to escort him into custody.

03:31.311 --> 03:33.212
Based on recently
acquired intelligence,

03:33.213 --> 03:35.681
we know Sark was promoted
to co-command

03:35.682 --> 03:37.583
The Covenant's
North American operations.

03:37.584 --> 03:42.248
It's imperative we learn
the identity of his associate.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.423
Excuse me.

03:44.424 --> 03:45.824
Ahh.

03:45.825 --> 03:46.992
There you are.

03:46.993 --> 03:48.894
Hello, Dad.
Good to see you.

03:48.895 --> 03:49.962
Please sit, Lauren.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.264
This concerns you as well.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.999
Once Sark is in custody,

03:54.000 --> 03:56.034
he will be transferred
to medical services

03:56.035 --> 03:58.595
and prepped
for the Inferno protocol.

03:58.671 --> 04:01.299
It's my understanding
that 50% of the test subjects

04:01.374 --> 04:03.934
suffered cardiac arrest
during that procedure.

04:04.010 --> 04:06.011
The United States
is not in the business

04:06.012 --> 04:08.013
of torturing witnesses
for information.

04:08.014 --> 04:11.313
Mr. Sark isn't being classified
as a prisoner of war.

04:11.384 --> 04:14.581
He has no protections
under the Geneva Convention.

04:14.654 --> 04:17.315
But given Sark's history
of selling out his employers,

04:17.390 --> 04:18.656
is it even necessary?

04:18.658 --> 04:20.559
He's likely to comply
quite willingly.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.094
That may have been true
in the past.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.825
He now has $800 million
invested in this organization.

04:24.897 --> 04:27.132
His loyalties will lie
with his money.

04:27.133 --> 04:30.728
All relevant materials you have
should be turned over to Jack.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.005
He'll be conducting
the interrogation.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.531
This has been cleared
through your superiors.

04:35.608 --> 04:37.909
Langley has requested
certain questions be included,

04:37.910 --> 04:39.344
some of which
contain information

04:39.345 --> 04:41.845
that exceeds
your classification level.

04:41.848 --> 04:44.348
I understand.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.288
I'll review this immediately.

04:51.324 --> 04:52.357
Director Dixon.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.026
Given Sark's importance
to The Covenant,

04:54.027 --> 04:56.461
we can't rule out the
possibility of a rescue attempt.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.396
Put her through.

04:57.397 --> 04:59.097
Put Level 3
containment procedures

04:59.098 --> 05:00.699
into effect immediately.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.200
No, they're not sick.

05:05.238 --> 05:06.872
I don't understand.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.373
Their carpool
picked them up hours ago.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.414
This cannot be good.

05:15.415 --> 05:17.082
Sark was supposed
to land 20 minutes ago.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.847
Agent Bristow here.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.154
We're on our way.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.156
Sark's plane just landed
in the desert

05:24.157 --> 05:26.657
60 miles east of here.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.514
Is the area secured?

05:49.515 --> 05:50.549
Copy that.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.075
No one's gotten on or off
the plane since it landed.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.060
Sark's gone.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.730
The plane landed on autopilot.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.032
We checked the body count
against the crew manifest.

06:41.033 --> 06:42.734
One of Sark's armed guards
was missing.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.703
If Sark had an accomplice,
we have to assume

06:44.704 --> 06:45.904
that he made it out alive.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.406
The passengers were frozen,

06:47.407 --> 06:50.001
indicating Sark may have
parachuted at altitude

06:50.076 --> 06:51.576
leaving the cabin
depressurized.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.278
Marshall's pulling
the satellite feeds.

06:53.279 --> 06:55.247
If Sark punched out
within a 100-mile radius,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.082
we should be able to narrow
our search.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.116
Put together a team.

06:58.117 --> 07:00.617
Be ready to move
on Marshall's lead.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.755
Sydney and Weiss
are on their way back

07:03.756 --> 07:05.357
with the flight recorders.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.359
Steven and Robin didn't
show up at school.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.022
I tried their cellphones.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.497
I've traded calls
with relatives, friends.

07:12.498 --> 07:14.366
Our neighbors.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.767
The police.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.599
It's Robin.
Thank God.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.541
Where have you been?

07:22.542 --> 07:24.876
We have your children.

07:24.877 --> 07:26.878
They're safe,
and they will remain so,

07:26.879 --> 07:29.780
assuming you follow
our demands precisely.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.614
Our calculations
indicate The Covenant

08:04.684 --> 08:07.778
abducted these children
between 8:30 and 8:45 a. m.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.821
In exchange
for their safe return,

08:09.822 --> 08:12.416
Sark is demanding
the release of these men.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.960
Five Covenant operatives
currently in custody

08:14.961 --> 08:16.528
apprehended within
the past year.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.029
- We have 48 hours.
That's impossible.

08:19.098 --> 08:21.623
Aren't these prisoners being
held by different governments?

08:21.701 --> 08:22.868
Yes, and even in the event

08:22.869 --> 08:25.237
that we could coordinate the
release of these prisoners,

08:25.238 --> 08:27.072
the diplomatic feat required
will take days,

08:27.073 --> 08:28.273
if not longer.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.941
We should begin working on

08:29.942 --> 08:31.576
securing their release
immediately.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.211
It's not that simple.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.647
There's a reason we don't
negotiate with terrorists.

08:35.648 --> 08:37.182
It sets a dangerous precedent.

08:37.183 --> 08:40.015
As would not doing everything
to protect those children.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.611
Who's to say that next week
the same organization

08:42.688 --> 08:45.714
won't target the children of
others working in Intelligence?

08:45.791 --> 08:47.692
We are not discussing
some hypothetical.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.928
The Covenant abducted
these hostages...

08:49.929 --> 08:52.429
Steven and Robin.

08:53.299 --> 08:54.366
I'm sorry?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.867
Their names.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.998
Steven and Robin.

09:02.808 --> 09:04.809
I only suggest that,

09:04.810 --> 09:08.678
for the safety
of all of our families,

09:08.748 --> 09:11.717
we may need to find
an alternative.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.552
Anyone else?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.147
Marshall is analyzing the
data recorder from the plane.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.556
It may give us a lead.

09:17.557 --> 09:21.516
May I also suggest
we at least begin negotiations

09:21.594 --> 09:23.461
with the countries
holding these prisoners?

09:23.462 --> 09:25.163
Whether or not we trade,

09:25.164 --> 09:27.432
as Ms. Reed mentioned,
this will be a lengthy process.

09:27.433 --> 09:29.668
We can use the negotiations
to buy time

09:29.669 --> 09:31.303
while having
The Covenant believe

09:31.304 --> 09:32.604
we are proceeding in good faith.

09:32.605 --> 09:35.540
Then that's how we'll proceed.

09:36.275 --> 09:37.909
One last thing.

09:37.910 --> 09:40.606
The only thing we do know
for certain...

09:41.080 --> 09:43.014
Sark managed his escape

09:43.015 --> 09:45.383
because he was provided
with information

09:45.384 --> 09:48.581
that could only have come
from this office.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.956
I want this leak identified.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.862
They're doing
exactly as we expected.

09:57.863 --> 10:01.026
The advantages of having
a predictable adversary.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.268
Not to mention
someone on the inside.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.236
Yes. Indeed.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.205
Which brings me
to my next question.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.574
Our superiors would like
to know how your efforts

10:09.575 --> 10:11.710
in securing a scapegoat
are progressing.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.305
I've already taken care of it.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.214
<i>Oui, Mr. Sloane?</i>

10:16.215 --> 10:18.216
Tell Karl that Judy's
on her way down.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.717
<i>Oui, Mr. Sloane.</i>

10:24.790 --> 10:27.290
The limo is here.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.860
I don't want to go.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.866
Then don't.

10:36.002 --> 10:42.237
I have used up all my sick days
and every conceivable excuse.

10:42.308 --> 10:45.300
I have got to get back to work.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.712
You may find this
hard to believe,

10:47.713 --> 10:51.240
but I'm usually
very professional.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.676
Why would I find that
hard to believe?

10:55.955 --> 10:59.356
I found our time together
very therapeutic.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.493
If the Agency finds out
about us,

11:09.568 --> 11:11.703
I will be totally discredited.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.905
No one will know.

11:13.906 --> 11:16.406
I give you my word.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.942
I wish that were enough.

11:20.046 --> 11:22.546
Mm-hmm.

11:22.915 --> 11:25.415
Judy...

11:26.952 --> 11:29.452
I'm not gonna
see you again, am I?

11:44.003 --> 11:46.503
I should go.

11:53.612 --> 11:56.172
This is the last
communication from the crew.

11:56.248 --> 11:58.550
Tell them you're
experiencing radio failure,

11:58.551 --> 12:00.452
or you're both dead.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.754
Albuquerque Center,
November Niner-Seven.

12:02.755 --> 12:05.255
We're experiencing intermittent
communication problems.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.454
- Nothing to worry about.
Copy that.

12:08.527 --> 12:09.928
Continue your approach.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.564
Please! Don't!

12:14.133 --> 12:16.301
We assume that Sark
bailed out over New Mexico.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.602
But check this out.

12:17.603 --> 12:20.538
20 minutes later, the recorder
picked up some faint noise.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.073
Can you be more specific?

12:22.074 --> 12:26.010
It turns out our friend
Mr. Sark made a phone call.

12:27.546 --> 12:29.748
Notify the extraction team.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.449
I should be at the L.Z.
On schedule.

12:31.450 --> 12:33.485
Do we have the hostages?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.453
Excellent.

12:35.454 --> 12:37.979
Not if I see you first, love.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.856
Sark was still on the plane
once they passed New Mexico.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.562
- That would put him in...
- Arizona.

12:44.563 --> 12:46.698
I tasked Echelon to focus
on a 200-mile radius

12:46.699 --> 12:47.732
around the drop point,

12:47.733 --> 12:49.300
added keywords
to the dictionary.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.929
Echelon picked up a burst
of Covenant communications

12:52.004 --> 12:54.205
from a warehouse in Nogales.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.970
I believe they might be
holding your children there.

13:00.513 --> 13:03.277
Based on Marshall's intel,
I have the authority

13:03.349 --> 13:05.517
to go tactical right now
and attempt a rescue.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.552
Or you can continue
the negotiations.

13:07.553 --> 13:09.721
I need an honest
assessment, Jack.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.790
The last time we did
business with The Covenant,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.291
they killed a hostage
as a negotiation tactic.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.060
If history is any indication,

13:16.061 --> 13:18.363
they may kill one of
your children to compel us

13:18.364 --> 13:19.697
to meet their demands.

13:19.698 --> 13:21.566
What if we give in
to their demands?

13:21.567 --> 13:24.297
There's no guarantee
they'll let them go unharmed.

13:24.370 --> 13:28.136
And if we attempt rescue,
the risks are equally high.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.707
I'm sorry.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.279
Prepare the tactical option.

13:43.222 --> 13:44.689
Marshall, we're in place.

13:44.690 --> 13:46.157
We're disabling
the alarm system.

13:46.158 --> 13:47.625
Once the alarm is down,

13:47.626 --> 13:50.356
you need to access
the closed-circuit feed.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.632
- Perimeter's clear.
- Alarms are down.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.868
We're hacking into
the closed-circuit feed now.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.838
Okay, receiving images.
Receiving.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.278
There they are!
I see them!

14:07.279 --> 14:08.980
The children are inside!

14:08.981 --> 14:11.416
I'm mapping coordinates.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.884
They're one level down.

14:12.885 --> 14:15.385
Let's go.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.028
Marshall, anything?

14:30.469 --> 14:32.969
Okay, try the first door
on your right.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.476
Robin?
Steven?

14:38.477 --> 14:40.078
Marshall, they're not here.

14:40.079 --> 14:43.048
That doesn't make any sense.
Hold on, let me do a re-scan.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.026
Oh, my God.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.596
We've got an explosive device.
12 left to go.

15:02.668 --> 15:04.602
Copy that, Boy Scout.
I'm checking it out.

15:07.072 --> 15:09.140
Marshall,
it's another explosive.

15:09.141 --> 15:10.508
59 seconds.

15:10.509 --> 15:13.501
Copy that, Mountaineer.
Can you describe it to me?

15:14.513 --> 15:16.614
It's got a wireless receiver.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.083
Oh, my God, the bomb
is connected to a network.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.452
There are six other charges.
You need to get out!

15:21.453 --> 15:22.854
The whole place is rigged.

15:22.855 --> 15:24.956
Team, fall back now!

15:24.957 --> 15:26.324
I'm going for my children.

15:26.325 --> 15:28.825
Copy that.
We got to go.

15:28.994 --> 15:30.561
Steven!
Robin!

15:30.562 --> 15:33.062
Dixon!

15:33.332 --> 15:35.733
No, this can't be.
This can't...

15:35.734 --> 15:38.430
Mountaineer, the children
are not in the building.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.471
The tape is on a loop.
It's a trap! Get out!

15:40.472 --> 15:42.573
Dixon, Marshall says
the tape is on a loop!

15:42.574 --> 15:43.675
We have to get out!

15:43.676 --> 15:44.776
I can't leave them!

15:44.777 --> 15:46.277
But they're not here!

15:46.278 --> 15:48.279
We don't know that!

15:48.280 --> 15:50.976
Dixon, if you stay here,
you are gonna die!

15:51.050 --> 15:55.043
Robin and Steven are out there,
and they need you to find them.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.023
Dixon, go!

16:39.832 --> 16:42.699
Marshall, I need you
to pull up the server logs

16:42.768 --> 16:44.502
for the classified FAA database.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.738
Sure.
No problem.

16:46.739 --> 16:47.939
What are we looking for?

16:47.940 --> 16:50.174
Everyone who accessed
Sark's flight information.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.939
Filter it to show only the
results from the last two days.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.512
No problem.

16:55.948 --> 16:58.781
There. That's not one of our
internal I.P. Addresses, is it?

16:58.851 --> 16:59.851
No, it's not.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.344
Looks like they logged on
using Dr. Barnett's account.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.690
That's interesting.
They...

17:05.691 --> 17:08.319
tried to spoof their I.P. By
bouncing it off several servers.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.056
- Can you find the origin?
- I think so.

17:40.325 --> 17:42.825
Jack.

17:43.128 --> 17:45.628
To what do I owe this pleasure?

17:45.798 --> 17:47.732
I take no pleasure in this,
Arvin.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.445
You're dismissed.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.847
Go!

18:17.796 --> 18:20.526
It wasn't enough for you
that I saw my wife die?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.867
I'm afraid I don't understand.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.902
They are children.

18:24.903 --> 18:26.003
Children.

18:26.004 --> 18:28.598
If I only knew what I was
being accused of, I...

18:31.143 --> 18:33.311
You gave information
to The Covenant.

18:33.312 --> 18:35.346
It's because of you
my children are missing.

18:35.347 --> 18:37.847
Dixon, I'm...

18:42.087 --> 18:44.851
The mistake I made was not
putting a bullet in your head

18:44.923 --> 18:47.423
three years ago
when I had the chance.

18:48.427 --> 18:50.862
Dixon, wait. No.
You can't do this.

18:50.863 --> 18:52.797
Get out.
I don't want you to see this.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.199
If you kill him,
it will be you locked up.

18:55.200 --> 18:56.300
Is that what you want?

18:56.301 --> 18:58.236
I want my children back.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.704
This is not
the way to help them.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.806
We'll find them.
We'll find them, Dixon.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.474
We'll bring them home.

19:03.475 --> 19:07.377
Sydney, for the last time.
Get out of here.

19:09.882 --> 19:13.477
What would Diane say
if she saw you like this?

19:14.153 --> 19:17.316
What about your kids?
They need you.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.889
What would they want you to do?

19:21.160 --> 19:24.220
What would they want you
to do, Marcus?

19:36.308 --> 19:38.808
Sydney.

19:39.745 --> 19:42.245
I didn't do this.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.908
God!
Steven!

20:43.909 --> 20:44.909
Oh, God.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.410
Daddy.

20:47.813 --> 20:50.805
Oh, Steven.
Are you all right?

20:51.583 --> 20:53.351
Where's your sister?

20:53.352 --> 20:55.286
You need to tell me.

20:55.287 --> 20:56.821
Where is Robin?

21:02.461 --> 21:04.961
They want to talk to you.

21:11.403 --> 21:16.272
They said they wanted me
to watch my children die.

21:16.341 --> 21:19.071
They wanted me to know
what it felt like.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.180
The Covenant knew we'd come.

21:23.181 --> 21:25.945
They fed us Echelon intercepts.

21:26.018 --> 21:30.216
Dangled the whereabouts
of my children like bait.

21:30.789 --> 21:33.289
The Covenant is now demanding
the immediate release

21:33.358 --> 21:35.059
of 10 prisoners.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.188
Any further attempts on our part
to outmaneuver them,

21:38.263 --> 21:40.763
and they have sworn...

21:41.133 --> 21:43.633
...I will never see
my daughter again.

21:44.603 --> 21:48.596
If I told you I was capable
of processing all of this,

21:48.674 --> 21:50.474
I would be lying.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.411
All I know is
my daughter is out there.

21:54.479 --> 21:59.439
And because of a failed
rescue mission I sanctioned,

21:59.518 --> 22:02.783
she is in even more danger.

22:02.854 --> 22:05.516
The emotional toll
this has taken

22:05.590 --> 22:08.090
and my current state of mind

22:08.160 --> 22:10.660
convinces me that I am no longer

22:10.696 --> 22:13.256
the best guarantee
of her return.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.165
Therefore,
I am stepping down temporarily

22:16.234 --> 22:20.500
as director of this task force
until this matter is resolved.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.041
Jack.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.444
I trust you will stand
in my stead

22:26.445 --> 22:28.512
and do everything
in your power

22:28.513 --> 22:31.013
to bring my daughter
back to me.

22:40.058 --> 22:42.226
Jack.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.195
I've already put in calls
to State.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.530
We're gonna do everything
in our power

22:46.531 --> 22:48.132
to meet The Covenant's demands.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.301
I appreciate it.

22:50.302 --> 22:53.066
The Covenant's agenda is rash.

22:53.138 --> 22:55.638
There's something behind
the boldness of their demands.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.541
- Like what?
- I don't know.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.876
Until we determine what it is,

22:58.877 --> 23:02.369
we should proceed negotiating
the release of the prisoners.

23:15.560 --> 23:18.060
How's he doing?

23:22.501 --> 23:24.068
He's dehydrated.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.936
But I think the damage is
more emotional than physical.

23:27.839 --> 23:29.473
So, what can I do?

23:29.474 --> 23:32.602
Sydney, Steven was sent back
with a message,

23:32.677 --> 23:35.373
but it had nothing to do
with releasing prisoners.

23:35.447 --> 23:36.514
I don't get it.

23:36.515 --> 23:40.451
They told me if I disclosed
their true demands to the CIA...

23:41.019 --> 23:43.154
...Robin would die.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.321
What do they want?

23:44.322 --> 23:46.822
A Rambaldi artifact
from Project: Black Hole

23:46.858 --> 23:49.293
in the Nevada desert.

23:49.294 --> 23:51.262
Lot 45.
I don't know what it is.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.830
Why the false demands?

23:52.831 --> 23:54.799
Keep the CIA occupied.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.967
The Covenant is aware
that I have clearance

23:56.968 --> 23:59.203
to enter the DSR facility.

23:59.204 --> 24:01.272
I have personal access codes.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.867
Access codes that can be
traced back to you?

24:03.942 --> 24:07.639
My daughter's life
is in their hands.

24:08.613 --> 24:12.549
If I could do this alone,
I would.

24:14.052 --> 24:16.552
Whatever you need.

24:34.706 --> 24:36.907
<i># Hit it #</i>

24:36.908 --> 24:38.175
<i># Stick 'em up #</i>

24:38.176 --> 24:39.977
<i># Stick 'em up, stick 'em up #</i>

24:39.978 --> 24:41.745
<i># Stick 'em up #</i>

24:41.746 --> 24:44.246
<i># Stick 'em up #</i>

24:50.355 --> 24:52.122
Miss, this is a restricted area.

24:52.123 --> 24:54.225
Dude...

24:54.226 --> 24:55.860
...this is sweet.

24:55.861 --> 24:57.495
I'm psyched to run into you.

24:57.496 --> 25:01.193
I was dunin' with my buddies,
and I got separated.

25:01.266 --> 25:04.099
I've been just goin' in
a circle for about an hour.

25:04.169 --> 25:06.763
Miss, you are not
supposed to be here.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.307
I'm not?

25:10.308 --> 25:11.842
The map says...

25:11.843 --> 25:14.343
Have a look.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.617
Can you ever read these things?
I can never tell.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.156
Dixon, I'm in position.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.657
Copy that.
Arriving now.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.698
The director of research
is expecting me.

25:37.102 --> 25:38.202
Thank you.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.837
Haven't had a chance
to congratulate you

25:39.838 --> 25:41.739
on your promotion, Erin.

25:41.740 --> 25:43.274
Thank you
for the recommendation.

25:43.275 --> 25:44.708
I'm sorry about your daughter.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.143
If there's anything we can do.

25:46.144 --> 25:47.545
I believe there is.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.674
Does the term "countershadow"
mean anything to you?

25:50.749 --> 25:52.550
I'm not sure
about countershadow.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.718
There are specific
references to shadows

25:54.719 --> 25:55.719
in neopaganism.

25:55.720 --> 25:57.955
There's over a dozen
references in the Bible.

25:57.956 --> 25:59.924
Anything Rambaldi-related?

25:59.925 --> 26:01.625
My son said his captors

26:01.626 --> 26:03.794
mentioned the word
"countershadow. "

26:03.795 --> 26:05.229
It's all I have to go on.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.960
I need access to a research
terminal for an hour or so.

26:08.033 --> 26:09.300
Not a problem.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.801
Mind if I tag along?

26:13.138 --> 26:14.805
Actually, I have to tag along.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.607
We're at a Code Orange.

26:16.608 --> 26:17.641
You understand.

26:17.642 --> 26:20.509
Understand?
I instituted the protocol.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.918
Dixon, I've reached the grate.

27:00.919 --> 27:02.920
Most of the files
are cross-referenced

27:02.921 --> 27:03.954
within the archive.

27:03.955 --> 27:07.482
But we should also check
the historical database.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.060
It's still sealed.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.298
This could take more time
than I thought.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.299
Coffee?

27:15.300 --> 27:17.800
Sure.
I'll have some brought in.

27:20.705 --> 27:22.339
Heat bubbles
are getting critical.

27:22.340 --> 27:24.308
I'm gonna have to abort.

27:24.309 --> 27:26.510
Oh!

27:26.511 --> 27:28.746
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry.

27:28.747 --> 27:31.648
All this hits
at the strangest times.

27:31.716 --> 27:33.717
I understand.

27:33.718 --> 27:37.176
Do you pray, Erin?

27:39.491 --> 27:42.927
No.
I'm agnostic, actually.

27:43.695 --> 27:47.153
Dixon, temperature is 248
and rising.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.302
Why don't I give you a moment?

27:52.303 --> 27:54.803
Thank you.

28:02.447 --> 28:06.110
Sydney, I'm patching into
the security console now.

28:13.892 --> 28:16.392
I'm through the grate.

28:23.301 --> 28:25.801
I'm in.

28:31.910 --> 28:34.410
This place...

28:35.280 --> 28:38.545
They've got every Rambaldi
artifact ever collected.

28:56.101 --> 28:58.601
Dixon, Lot 45 is gone.

29:05.276 --> 29:06.643
Dixon, what do I do?

29:06.644 --> 29:09.144
Give me a second.
I'll try to find it.

29:15.487 --> 29:17.987
It's been moved for analysis.
Level eight, quadrant one.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.489
I'm on my way.

29:23.528 --> 29:25.829
Did you call
the Algerian minister?

29:25.830 --> 29:28.330
Yes, sir.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.268
Hello, Ambassador?

29:38.576 --> 29:40.744
These negotiations
are meant to fail.

29:40.745 --> 29:42.412
Why?

29:42.413 --> 29:44.681
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.984
All of the resources of this
agency are being diverted

29:46.985 --> 29:49.453
to meet demands The Covenant
must know are unattainable.

29:49.454 --> 29:51.789
Which leads me to believe
it's merely a distraction.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.223
What do they really want?

29:53.224 --> 29:56.716
Well, then my question to you
is why target Dixon?

29:56.795 --> 29:59.295
What does he have
access to, Jack?

30:02.534 --> 30:05.034
Come on, Jack.

30:05.170 --> 30:09.004
If you want my help, you're
just gonna have to trust me.

30:09.073 --> 30:12.167
He has access
to Project: Black Hole.

30:16.381 --> 30:17.748
Proceed down the North corridor

30:17.749 --> 30:20.684
until you reach the central lab,
room 74.

30:20.752 --> 30:23.252
That's where they're
holding Lot 45.

30:29.494 --> 30:30.694
I'm approaching the door.

30:30.695 --> 30:31.695
It's locked.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.196
I'm working on it.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.533
Got it.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.749
- I see it.
Good.

30:52.750 --> 30:54.017
Can you get to it?

30:54.018 --> 30:56.086
I can try.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.587
Go ahead.

31:46.070 --> 31:47.371
I've got the artifact.

31:47.372 --> 31:49.273
I'll meet you
at the rendezvous point.

31:49.274 --> 31:51.774
Copy that.

32:18.469 --> 32:20.969
Director Dixon!

32:26.444 --> 32:27.945
You forgot the hard copy.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.112
Oh.

32:29.113 --> 32:30.180
Thank you.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.982
You saved me a trip back here.

32:31.983 --> 32:34.483
You're welcome.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.356
I got your message.

32:39.357 --> 32:40.757
Dixon made contact.

32:40.758 --> 32:43.160
He's prepared
to make the exchange.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.394
I understand.

32:44.395 --> 32:45.529
I must admit,

32:45.530 --> 32:48.897
I wasn't sure the good
director had it in him.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.200
I'm impressed.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.965
That man is living
through his worst nightmare.

32:53.037 --> 32:55.072
You might consider
losing the sarcasm.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.506
How touching.

32:56.507 --> 32:58.308
You actually care.

32:58.309 --> 32:59.743
When is the meet?

32:59.744 --> 33:01.378
Four hours.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.879
Make sure nothing interferes.

33:19.063 --> 33:20.897
What is this about?

33:20.898 --> 33:23.100
I know you removed an artifact

33:23.101 --> 33:25.601
from Project: Black Hole
to trade with The Covenant.

33:25.636 --> 33:27.604
- I talked to Sloane.
- Sloane?

33:27.605 --> 33:29.039
The Covenant is desperate

33:29.040 --> 33:31.308
to acquire a box
constructed by Rambaldi.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.777
It's Sloane's understanding
that they're close to locating

33:33.778 --> 33:34.778
a key to activate it.

33:34.779 --> 33:37.180
Why should we trust
a thing Sloane says?

33:37.181 --> 33:39.082
Sloane believes
the contents of that box,

33:39.083 --> 33:40.417
in The Covenant's hands,

33:40.418 --> 33:42.119
will put Sydney's life
in jeopardy.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.620
And I believe him.

33:45.123 --> 33:47.990
Dad, there is something
you should know.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.926
There's an inscription
on the box.

33:50.995 --> 33:53.495
Mom's name.

33:54.232 --> 33:57.497
You cannot give The Covenant
the artifact.

33:57.568 --> 33:59.603
Not until we know more.

33:59.604 --> 34:01.438
By then Robin could be dead.

34:01.439 --> 34:03.440
Jack, if I had another option...

34:03.441 --> 34:05.842
We can produce
a duplicate artifact,

34:05.843 --> 34:07.811
send in a team
to the exchange site,

34:07.812 --> 34:09.545
apprehend Sark once
the trade occurs.

34:09.547 --> 34:12.539
If Sark in any way thinks we're
trying to double-cross him,

34:12.617 --> 34:14.951
my daughter will suffer
the consequences.

34:14.952 --> 34:17.054
- I can't take that risk.
- I share your concern.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.554
Which is why I'm committed
to finding a way out of this

34:19.556 --> 34:21.591
without risking
my daughter's life as well.

34:21.592 --> 34:24.822
Robin didn't choose this life.
I did.

34:24.896 --> 34:27.396
It's my decision to make, Dad.

34:29.766 --> 34:32.496
And the exchange
is happening tomorrow.

34:34.237 --> 34:36.737
Then I'm going with you.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.708
Tell the Algerian minister
that if he refuses,

34:40.777 --> 34:43.542
I will personally see to it
that his foreign aid bill

34:43.614 --> 34:45.382
doesn't make it
to the Senate floor.

34:45.382 --> 34:48.681
Sir, Project: Black Hole
has been compromised.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.253
Tell him I'll call back.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.123
Excuse me?

34:53.123 --> 34:54.690
Lot 45 is missing.

34:54.692 --> 34:56.927
A list has been compiled
of all visitors and workers

34:56.928 --> 35:00.056
at the facility
in the last 24 hours.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.531
That'll be all.

35:01.532 --> 35:04.032
Yes, sir.

35:09.740 --> 35:12.008
This is Senator Reed.

35:12.009 --> 35:15.706
I want Marcus Dixon's name
added to the federal watch list,

35:15.780 --> 35:17.914
and I want
a tactical team deployed

35:17.915 --> 35:21.043
to bring him
into custody immediately.

35:27.558 --> 35:28.792
What is it?

35:28.793 --> 35:31.293
Dixon needs our help.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.676
Air Unit One,
what's your status?

35:48.746 --> 35:51.047
Air Unit One engaging GPS

35:51.048 --> 35:52.749
to locate the target area.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.518
- The helicopters are up.
- We wouldn't ask...

35:54.519 --> 35:55.785
Listen, say no more.

35:55.786 --> 35:59.051
If anybody ever laid a hand
on my mini-Mitch, I swear...

36:09.600 --> 36:11.401
They're using
a GPS navigation system

36:11.402 --> 36:13.036
- to vector the choppers.
- Meaning?

36:13.037 --> 36:15.438
I might be able
to uplink to their GPS receiver

36:15.439 --> 36:17.040
and induce a deviation error.

36:17.041 --> 36:18.108
Might or can?

36:18.109 --> 36:20.076
We'll find out soon enough.

36:20.077 --> 36:23.103
Air Unit One,
receiving GPS signal.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.681
Proceeding to target area.

36:44.468 --> 36:46.968
I want my daughter.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.708
Once I take possession
of Lot 45,

36:51.709 --> 36:53.543
my associate will release her.

36:53.544 --> 36:56.044
You have my word.

36:56.347 --> 36:59.248
Air Unit One,
we're over the contact area.

36:59.317 --> 37:01.817
There's no one here.

37:02.653 --> 37:05.055
Well, it looks like
they're taking a little detour

37:05.056 --> 37:07.616
outside of Long Beach Harbor
over the Pacific Ocean.

37:07.692 --> 37:10.192
Thank you so much, Marshall.

37:42.393 --> 37:44.361
I'm afraid I'm going
to need some insurance

37:44.362 --> 37:47.593
to guarantee I reach
my extraction point safely.

37:47.665 --> 37:50.100
This collar contains
a lethal cardiotoxin.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.469
Once I've placed this
on your daughter,

37:52.470 --> 37:54.271
you'll have two minutes
to disarm it

37:54.272 --> 37:56.772
before the compound
is released into her system.

37:56.841 --> 37:58.341
You son of a bitch!

37:58.342 --> 38:00.377
That was not part
of our agreement.

38:00.378 --> 38:03.211
This mechanism is well within
your disarming capabilities.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.448
Two minutes is generous,
in my opinion.

38:05.449 --> 38:07.450
You will not put that
on my daughter.

38:07.451 --> 38:08.985
- Use me instead.
- Sydney.

38:08.986 --> 38:11.486
Put the collar on me.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.795
She's 13 years old.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.330
All right, very well.

38:28.139 --> 38:31.131
If you try and remove this
device before disarming it,

38:31.208 --> 38:33.904
the injection is instantaneous.

38:33.978 --> 38:36.478
Now I want my daughter.

38:43.387 --> 38:44.387
As always...

38:44.388 --> 38:46.389
it has been a pleasure
doing business with you.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.558
Sark!

38:48.559 --> 38:51.619
You don't deserve to walk
out of here alive.

38:51.696 --> 38:54.529
Before you consider
taking any drastic measures,

38:54.598 --> 38:56.166
you should know

38:56.167 --> 38:58.761
that if I release my grip
on this remote,

38:58.836 --> 39:00.437
the toxin will automatically

39:00.438 --> 39:02.872
go into your daughter's
bloodstream.

39:02.873 --> 39:05.603
A fail-safe, if you will.

39:07.445 --> 39:09.945
As I said,
you have two minutes.

39:11.949 --> 39:14.084
Get Robin out of here.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.252
- Do it. Now.
- Go.

39:16.253 --> 39:18.753
Sydney, stand very still.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.761
The mechanism's armed.

39:24.762 --> 39:27.856
Our best bet is to sever
its link to the relay board.

39:27.932 --> 39:29.799
I see it.
It's wired to a mirror.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.067
If we clip the lead,

39:31.068 --> 39:33.969
it will register
the voltage drop.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.038
Dad...

39:35.039 --> 39:37.539
Easy.

39:39.744 --> 39:42.244
It's okay.

40:16.447 --> 40:17.847
If I told you I was innocent

40:17.848 --> 40:19.616
of these charges,
would you believe me?

40:19.617 --> 40:22.117
No.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.519
Look, Judy, why don't you
ask yourself...

40:28.759 --> 40:31.259
If I wanted to damage you,

40:31.328 --> 40:33.663
if I wanted to damage the CIA,

40:33.664 --> 40:36.164
would I be so careless?

40:36.434 --> 40:37.767
Would I leave a trail

40:37.768 --> 40:40.170
that so obviously leads
in my direction?

40:40.171 --> 40:42.671
You used me.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.208
I compromised my judgment

40:45.209 --> 40:48.508
because I believed
that you had changed.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.613
But you are incapable of it.

40:56.053 --> 40:58.988
If you can't trust me now,
I accept that.

40:59.323 --> 41:03.191
All I ask is that you respect
the confidentiality

41:03.260 --> 41:05.760
in what I told you.

41:06.864 --> 41:09.697
Regarding my affair with Irina.

41:15.072 --> 41:16.406
I'm going home.

41:16.407 --> 41:17.740
Have you seen your father?

41:17.741 --> 41:18.975
I haven't seen him.

41:18.976 --> 41:20.743
Maybe that's a good thing.

41:20.744 --> 41:22.078
You might be right.

41:22.079 --> 41:23.546
Lauren, Vaughn.

41:23.547 --> 41:26.141
It's come to my attention
that Senator Reed's effort

41:26.217 --> 41:30.586
to retrieve Lot 45
was thwarted inexplicably.

41:31.188 --> 41:33.423
Well, I imagine the Senator
will be gearing up

41:33.424 --> 41:34.491
for an inquiry.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.860
Although I doubt he'll find
any concrete evidence

41:36.861 --> 41:38.661
of wrongdoing.

41:38.662 --> 41:42.189
Well, whoever intervened
to save Robin's life,

41:42.266 --> 41:46.862
not to mention Sydney's,
is owed my deepest gratitude.

41:46.937 --> 41:49.437
Good night, Jack.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.843
See you later?

41:53.844 --> 41:56.344
Not if I see you first, love.
