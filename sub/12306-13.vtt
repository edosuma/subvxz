WEBVTT

00:00.830 --> 00:02.423
And when we come back,

00:02.430 --> 00:03.454
Our own keith bradshaw

00:03.469 --> 00:04.369
Has a special report

00:04.370 --> 00:05.792
On which southern california
restaurants

00:05.800 --> 00:07.962
Aren't making the grade
when it comes

00:07.970 --> 00:09.392
To serving
sanitary meals.

00:09.410 --> 00:12.004
Good thing I've
already had dinner.

00:12.010 --> 00:15.708
Stay with us.
We'll be right back.

00:15.710 --> 00:16.939
Woman: And we're out.

00:16.950 --> 00:20.375
[indistinct chatter]

00:22.180 --> 00:23.909
Hey, john.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.352
Ok. You're good.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.679
Man: Sorry.
Let me just--

00:57.690 --> 01:01.809
There we go.
Good. You're good.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.693
My daughter.

01:17.710 --> 01:18.905
Oh, my god.

01:18.910 --> 01:21.038
Oh, my god.
Emma. Oh, my god!

01:21.040 --> 01:21.836
John, what happened?

01:21.840 --> 01:23.103
And we're back
in 3, 2...

01:23.110 --> 01:25.249
No. No, no, no, no.
He's at my house!

01:25.250 --> 01:26.809
Somebody, call
the police!

01:26.820 --> 01:27.776
Please help me!

01:27.780 --> 01:30.112
Get the police
to my house now, now!

01:30.120 --> 01:31.281
Woman: John, what's wrong?

01:31.290 --> 01:32.439
He's gonna hurt
my daughter.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.189
He's gonna hurt my
daughter. Help me! Help me!

01:34.190 --> 01:36.284
We, uh, apologize
to our viewers.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.928
We are experiencing an
emergency situation here.

01:37.930 --> 01:41.355
Help me!
Somebody, help me!

02:07.390 --> 02:08.515
Morning.

02:08.520 --> 02:09.988
Morning, jack.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.355
I just wanted to
say thanks

02:11.360 --> 02:14.330
For the other night,
confiding in me.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.822
I know it's not an
easy thing for you to do,

02:16.830 --> 02:19.697
And I appreciate it.

02:19.700 --> 02:22.135
Thank you
for listening.

02:22.140 --> 02:23.494
Question. Who else
in the office

02:23.510 --> 02:25.160
Because janice knows
about your real name

02:25.170 --> 02:27.036
And your life
in seattle?

02:27.040 --> 02:29.475
Well, her, amanda,
and you.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.744
I'd like to keep it
that way for now.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.605
Of course.

02:35.380 --> 02:38.213
Michelle, huh?
I can see it.

02:38.220 --> 02:42.714
I like beth, but
michelle works, too.

02:44.490 --> 02:46.822
Come in.
Shut the door.

02:48.760 --> 02:50.489
I just spoke
with perry whitley's father.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.867
He refuses to file
a missing persons report.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.464
He expressed his concern
but is more concerned

02:55.470 --> 02:57.632
About keeping it quiet.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.376
This just in.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.178
Thanks.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.602
How's your friend tracy?

03:04.610 --> 03:06.271
She left town. She's
staying with a friend

03:06.280 --> 03:07.543
Till we can find
perry.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.644
Can we put out an apb
based on the assault charge?

03:09.650 --> 03:11.049
No. Perry's father
posted bail.

03:11.050 --> 03:13.041
There's nothing we can do
until he fails

03:13.060 --> 03:14.482
To show up
for his prelim.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.584
If we want to put
perry away,

03:16.590 --> 03:19.059
We have to build
a New case.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.960
Somebody, call the police.
Please help me!

03:22.970 --> 03:24.790
Get the police
to my house now! Now!

03:24.800 --> 03:26.165
What are you
watching?

03:26.170 --> 03:27.467
You remember john bardo?

03:27.470 --> 03:28.733
Channel 12
news guy.

03:28.740 --> 03:30.139
Last night,
he received a text

03:30.140 --> 03:31.062
During the broadcast.

03:31.070 --> 03:32.435
It was a video taken
from inside

03:32.440 --> 03:33.862
His daughter's closet.

03:33.880 --> 03:34.904
Bardo freaks out
on air.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.605
Turns out, his daughter
was at the movies.

03:36.610 --> 03:37.634
She was safe,
thank god.

03:37.650 --> 03:39.300
The video was recorded
a week prior,

03:39.320 --> 03:40.503
And the text came
from a burner,

03:40.520 --> 03:41.646
So it couldn't
be traced.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.049
We handled a stalking case
for him two years ago.

03:43.050 --> 03:45.280
Man obsessed with
bardo from his newscast.

03:45.290 --> 03:46.985
Broke into his house,
tried to kill him, right?

03:46.990 --> 03:48.856
Yeah. Sam russell,
a crime stringer.

03:48.860 --> 03:50.749
He chased crime scenes
and traffic accidents.

03:50.760 --> 03:52.159
He started supplying
tips to bardo

03:52.160 --> 03:53.719
When he was still
a field reporter.

03:53.730 --> 03:55.220
Sam idolized bardo,

03:55.230 --> 03:56.197
Became obsessed with him,

03:56.200 --> 03:57.759
And then when he started
stalking him,

03:57.770 --> 04:00.421
I was notified. Sam was
released 3 months ago.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.192
John on tv: Somebody,
call the police!

04:02.200 --> 04:03.065
Please help me!

04:03.070 --> 04:04.333
Get the police
to my house now! Now!

04:04.340 --> 04:05.865
The police are trying
to locate russell now.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.929
He's not at home, but he
has a clean probation report.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.704
Bardo could have
a new stalker.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.849
You know, these news
people, they get this a lot.

04:11.850 --> 04:13.249
All right. We'll talk
to bardo.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.878
Jack, let's go. You
guys, find us our stringer.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.745
Beth: According
to the exif file,

04:17.750 --> 04:19.387
This video was
taken last week.

04:19.390 --> 04:21.916
My ex-wife linda and I,
we share custody.

04:21.920 --> 04:24.651
Emma stays with me
every other week.

04:24.660 --> 04:28.255
It was him, wasn't
it? Same russell?

04:28.260 --> 04:29.227
Have you arrested him?

04:29.230 --> 04:30.925
We'll talk to him,
but we may have to

04:30.930 --> 04:32.125
Treat this
as a new threat.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.598
You may have
another stalker.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.093
Jack: Have you noticed any other
attention recently from your fans,

04:37.110 --> 04:39.636
People in your life,
ex-wife?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.302
What happened
with your marriage?

04:42.310 --> 04:43.471
A man broke
into my home

04:43.480 --> 04:45.903
And tried to kill me
in front of my wife.

04:45.910 --> 04:48.049
After that, we couldn't
make it work.

04:48.050 --> 04:49.074
My whole life fell apart.

04:49.080 --> 04:50.946
I still look
over my shoulder.

04:50.950 --> 04:54.887
We're on good terms
because of my daughter.

04:54.890 --> 04:56.289
His ex linda is
a sweetheart.

04:56.290 --> 04:57.485
She couldn't be
behind this.

04:57.490 --> 05:01.051
And, lauren, how long
have you two been together?

05:01.060 --> 05:02.755
4 or 5 weeks. Why?

05:02.770 --> 05:05.330
Well, it's routine, hon.
They have to ask.

05:05.330 --> 05:06.764
And you live here
with john?

05:06.770 --> 05:08.568
No. No. I just
came over last night

05:08.570 --> 05:09.696
When I heard
what happened.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.702
Any signs of break-in,
anything moved or taken?

05:12.710 --> 05:14.303
Look. It has to be
sam russell.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.130
There is no way
I have two stalkers.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.732
I mean, come on.
What are the odds?

05:17.750 --> 05:18.808
You'd be surprised.

05:18.810 --> 05:20.574
People in your profession
often attract

05:20.580 --> 05:21.775
Obsessive personalities.

05:21.780 --> 05:23.418
They notified me,
all right?

05:23.420 --> 05:24.546
He was released
3 months ago.

05:24.550 --> 05:27.781
I know, and I will
talk to him personally.

05:27.790 --> 05:31.090
We'll get to the truth,
I promise.

05:31.090 --> 05:32.979
[sighs]

05:33.630 --> 05:35.689
Beth: Why were you
hiding from us?

05:35.700 --> 05:38.567
I knew you were
gonna accuse me.

05:38.570 --> 05:39.526
I know what
happened.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.793
John bardo's
the news story of the day.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.063
I'm not your guy.

05:43.070 --> 05:45.801
I would never hurt
john or his family.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.107
I respect the man.

05:47.110 --> 05:49.431
Funny way of showing
your admiration,

05:49.450 --> 05:51.179
Showing up at his house
with a gun.

05:51.180 --> 05:54.571
That was a misunderstanding
two years ago.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.810
I went over to his house
to talk to him.

05:56.820 --> 06:00.586
I practice my
second amendment rights.

06:00.590 --> 06:02.684
I would never
hurt john.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.249
Where were you
last night?

06:04.260 --> 06:06.251
Home, editing.

06:06.260 --> 06:09.059
I have a crime blog.
It takes up all my time.

06:09.060 --> 06:10.255
And the night
of the 24th?

06:10.270 --> 06:13.524
That was the night of the
big accident on the 101.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.269
I was there shooting
"b" roll.

06:15.270 --> 06:17.261
Can anyone vouch
for you?

06:17.270 --> 06:21.400
No, but I'm not
stalking john.

06:21.410 --> 06:24.710
You guys should be out there
looking for the real stalker.

06:24.710 --> 06:26.804
- John could be in
serious trouble, you know.

06:26.820 --> 06:32.680
He's a good guy, and someone
has to watch out for him.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.816
Beth: I'm not convinced
sam is reformed,

06:36.830 --> 06:39.788
But I'm not so sure
the psychology adds up.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.825
Sam is a intimacy-seeking
stalker.

06:41.830 --> 06:43.924
He wants a closer
connection to john.

06:43.930 --> 06:45.091
He only escalated
two years ago

06:45.100 --> 06:46.465
Because john rejected
his help.

06:46.470 --> 06:50.293
I just don't see him sending
threatening texts or videos.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.961
That seems like something we
see more in resentful stalkers.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.075
I checked the alibis for the
ex-wife, the new girlfriend.

06:56.080 --> 06:57.002
Neither have motives.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.705
His daughter seems
well-adjusted.

06:58.710 --> 06:59.871
It's not a prank.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.416
Ok. Then john has
a new stalker.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.218
Let's go with that
for now.

07:03.220 --> 07:04.517
News anchors are
the most common

07:04.520 --> 07:05.544
Of celebrity stalking cases.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.848
They're in everybody's
living room,

07:07.860 --> 07:09.009
Looking
through the camera

07:09.020 --> 07:10.579
Into the eyes
of the people watching them.

07:10.590 --> 07:12.354
It's intimate.
They become fixated.

07:12.360 --> 07:14.249
They really think
they have a relationship

07:14.260 --> 07:15.227
With these people.

07:15.230 --> 07:16.595
Well, ben and I
went to the news station.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.329
We grilled the whole
staff, co-workers.

07:18.330 --> 07:21.595
No one had heard or seen
an unusual fan, nothing.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.965
What's that?

07:22.970 --> 07:23.698
What?

07:23.710 --> 07:26.065
Go back
frame by frame.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.135
There.
What is it?

07:28.140 --> 07:29.471
Can you enhance it?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.006
You see it?
Reflection in the mirror?

07:32.010 --> 07:33.546
I can better that.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.245
Someone inside wearing
a dark jacket.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.877
Is that a logo?
Partial logo.

07:36.890 --> 07:37.914
Can you decipher it?

07:37.920 --> 07:39.012
Yeah. Give me
some time.

07:39.020 --> 07:40.886
Beth: Janice, let's get
a unit on john's house

07:40.890 --> 07:42.119
And his ex-wife
and his daughter.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.829
Let's keep them safe till
we can figure something out.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.656
How's emma?

07:50.670 --> 07:52.559
Ok. Well,
the security company's

07:52.570 --> 07:55.232
Gonna be with you guys
24 hours a day

07:55.240 --> 07:57.060
Until they catch this guy.

07:57.070 --> 08:00.608
Look. I'm--I'm
really sorry, linda.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.830
I know, but I all I want is
for you and emma to be safe.

08:03.850 --> 08:05.875
You know that.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.771
Yeah. Ahem.
Ok. Bye.

08:10.650 --> 08:11.913
Was that your ex?

08:11.920 --> 08:13.888
Yeah. Ahem.

08:13.890 --> 08:15.654
What did she want?

08:15.660 --> 08:20.222
Hmm. I, um--I hired
a security team

08:20.230 --> 08:23.256
To watch after he
and emma.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.830
You're a good man,
john,

08:25.830 --> 08:28.128
But I don't know why you
don't do the same thing

08:28.140 --> 08:30.563
At your own house.

08:30.570 --> 08:32.129
I did.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.801
Security will be
here tomorrow.

08:33.809 --> 08:36.404
You know, you didn't
have to stay here tonight.

08:36.409 --> 08:38.947
I know all this is
really freaking you out.

08:38.950 --> 08:42.544
I'm not gonna
leave you like she did.

08:56.760 --> 08:59.070
[thud]

08:59.070 --> 09:00.822
What was that?

09:03.440 --> 09:05.465
I don't know.

09:07.070 --> 09:08.140
Where are you going?

09:08.140 --> 09:10.700
Stay here. Lock the
door and call the police.

09:10.710 --> 09:11.541
John, don't!

09:11.550 --> 09:13.177
Lauren, I am not
a victim.

09:13.180 --> 09:15.877
Lock the door
and call the police.

10:26.220 --> 10:28.655
You son of a bitch!

10:28.660 --> 10:30.412
Get out here!

10:30.430 --> 10:32.626
Come on!
Show your face!

10:34.560 --> 10:36.756
Where are you?

10:44.540 --> 10:45.666
Oh, my god.

10:45.670 --> 10:48.105
Lauren, lauren, lauren!

10:48.110 --> 10:49.771
He's in the room
with you!

10:49.780 --> 10:51.100
He's in the bathroom!

10:51.110 --> 10:52.441
Unlock the door!

10:52.450 --> 10:54.509
Aah! Aah!
Lauren!

10:54.520 --> 10:57.478
[screaming]

11:00.390 --> 11:03.917
Aah!
Lapd. Don't move!

11:04.790 --> 11:06.929
Stay on the ground.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.654
You got him?

11:16.670 --> 11:17.592
I'm not lying

11:17.610 --> 11:19.601
Why did you break
into john's house?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.032
He needed my help.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.202
You attacked
his girlfriend.

11:23.210 --> 11:26.100
John needs me.
He doesn't need her.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.202
Is he gay?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.109
Is it romantic
obsession?

11:29.120 --> 11:30.349
No. He worships him.

11:30.350 --> 11:32.819
He doesn't want anyone
to be near john but him.

11:32.820 --> 11:33.946
No one's good enough.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.883
You didn't answer
the question.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.450
After I spoke
with you guys,

11:38.460 --> 11:40.428
I got scared for john,

11:40.430 --> 11:41.989
So I had to find out.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.423
You broke probation.

11:44.430 --> 11:47.092
You're going
back to prison.

11:47.100 --> 11:48.864
I'm sorry.

11:48.870 --> 11:50.167
Don't send me back.

11:50.170 --> 11:52.161
I ca--I can't
follow the news

11:52.170 --> 11:53.535
If you send me back.

11:53.540 --> 11:57.704
Please! I-I screwed up
just the once.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.041
This guy's
not well.

11:59.050 --> 12:02.350
But I'm not so sure he's
the one we're looking for.

12:02.350 --> 12:04.910
Look. C-c-can I--
can I go to a city jail?

12:04.920 --> 12:08.345
If you send me upstate,
I can't get channel 12.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.112
I won't do it again,
I swe--

12:10.130 --> 12:11.689
Is john back there?

12:11.690 --> 12:14.330
Jo--john, I would never
hurt you, john!

12:14.330 --> 12:16.094
You know this!
Tell them!

12:16.100 --> 12:18.398
We confiscated his video
and recording equipment

12:18.400 --> 12:19.993
He had quite the setup.
Looks like he's been

12:20.000 --> 12:22.059
Following
john and his family.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.299
Any video
of john's daughter?

12:23.310 --> 12:24.630
None from her bedroom,
but there is footage

12:24.640 --> 12:26.631
Of her, john,
john's ex-wife,

12:26.640 --> 12:27.710
And most
of his colleagues.

12:27.710 --> 12:29.508
So sam was stalking
by proxy until last night.

12:29.510 --> 12:31.137
That's how he's
getting his fix

12:31.150 --> 12:32.470
Without violating
his tro.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.676
He was stalking
everyone around the person

12:34.680 --> 12:35.670
He was obsessed with.

12:35.680 --> 12:37.273
I'm still combing
through the footage,

12:37.290 --> 12:39.748
But I found one thing
of interest.

12:39.760 --> 12:40.750
Ben: An altercation.

12:40.760 --> 12:41.818
Jack: Who's
the other guy?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.289
Keith bradshaw,
field correspondent.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.758
They're arguing
about something.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.558
Ben: A little digging,
and I found out

12:47.560 --> 12:48.550
Keith was up for anchor,

12:48.560 --> 12:49.698
But john got
the job instead.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.259
So maybe keith
seeks retribution

12:51.270 --> 12:52.396
For perceived
injustice,

12:52.400 --> 12:53.822
Starts stalking
his work colleague.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.467
Classic case
of workplace stalking.

12:55.470 --> 12:59.600
Which usually escalates
quickly to violence.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.566
Damn. That hurt.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.799
John never mentioned
any co-worker dispute.

13:02.810 --> 13:03.936
He clocked him.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.475
Well, no charges
were ever filed.

13:05.480 --> 13:06.572
What's the date
on that?

13:06.580 --> 13:08.344
December 14,
around the same time

13:08.350 --> 13:09.340
John was promoted.

13:09.350 --> 13:10.442
Maybe keith
was jealous.

13:10.450 --> 13:12.418
I spoke to the station's
hr department myself.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.014
There was no record
of a co-worker rivalry.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.488
Most victims of
workplace stalking

13:16.490 --> 13:17.480
Won't run
to the boss.

13:17.490 --> 13:18.821
They're afraid
of getting fired.

13:18.830 --> 13:20.059
Ben, go through
this footage.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.425
Let's see who else
we can link to john.

13:21.430 --> 13:24.092
In the meantime, we'll
talk to keith bradshaw.

13:27.170 --> 13:30.538
[ball bouncing]

13:38.580 --> 13:41.003
Told you
I'd be back.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.545
What do you want,
a medal?

13:42.550 --> 13:45.986
No. No. I just
want to talk.

13:45.990 --> 13:50.712
Have you thought any about
what we discussed last time?

13:50.730 --> 13:51.720
It won't work.

13:51.730 --> 13:56.099
Yes, it will.
I know it will.

13:56.100 --> 13:59.024
Why do you want
to help me?

13:59.030 --> 14:00.725
The two of us,

14:00.740 --> 14:02.538
We're like-minded,
right?

14:02.540 --> 14:06.636
We--we share a--
a kinship of suffering,

14:06.640 --> 14:09.109
A mutual obsession.

14:09.110 --> 14:11.499
Michelle.

14:11.510 --> 14:13.604
Tell me about her.

14:21.520 --> 14:23.818
She changed her name?

14:25.960 --> 14:27.553
Yes.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.198
She goes
by beth davis.

14:29.200 --> 14:33.592
She's a detective--
well, lieutenant actually.

14:33.600 --> 14:37.264
She's in charge of lapd's
threat assessment unit.

14:37.270 --> 14:40.570
She investigates
stalking cases.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.280
Is she married?

14:44.280 --> 14:48.615
No. She lives alone,
very few friends.

14:48.620 --> 14:51.988
She's very guarded.

14:51.990 --> 14:53.014
No real personal life.

14:53.020 --> 14:55.182
Her work is
everything to her.

14:55.190 --> 14:57.750
She's a do-gooder.

14:57.760 --> 14:58.682
Very much so.

14:58.690 --> 15:02.297
It helps her
with the guilt.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.553
Because
of her family?

15:04.570 --> 15:09.736
They were all killed when
her house caught fire.

15:09.740 --> 15:13.199
Why did you kill them?

15:13.210 --> 15:16.407
I never meant to.

15:16.410 --> 15:20.142
But--but you set
the fire.

15:20.150 --> 15:21.948
So I could save them,

15:21.950 --> 15:24.078
So I could be
the hero,

15:24.090 --> 15:28.015
So I could get her
to come back to me.

15:33.760 --> 15:39.699
Well...We'll figure out a new
way for you to win her back.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.262
We can help each other.

15:44.540 --> 15:49.273
You really think you
can get me out of here?

15:49.280 --> 15:51.476
I know I can.

15:52.450 --> 15:54.043
Keith: Yeah, I punched
him. He deserved it.

15:54.050 --> 15:56.178
Beth: Why? Because he
got the promotion over you?

15:56.180 --> 15:58.569
No. I was brought out
here from chicago

15:58.590 --> 15:59.785
With the promise
of being anchor,

15:59.790 --> 16:01.610
And then two months ago
out of nowhere,

16:01.620 --> 16:03.509
They offer
the anchor desk to john.

16:03.530 --> 16:04.759
How's that
john's fault?

16:04.760 --> 16:06.080
I didn't say
it's his fault.

16:06.090 --> 16:08.149
It's just--you know,
it pissed me off, ok,

16:08.160 --> 16:09.457
Because I don't like
the guy,

16:09.460 --> 16:11.121
And now I got to look
at that--that face

16:11.130 --> 16:13.622
And that dumb smile
every day.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.222
How do you feel
about him now?

16:19.010 --> 16:21.035
Oh. Wait. You guys
think I had something

16:21.040 --> 16:22.701
To do with what happened
to john?

16:22.710 --> 16:23.700
You have motive.

16:23.710 --> 16:24.871
With him out
of the picture,

16:24.880 --> 16:26.177
You're next in line
to be anchor.

16:26.180 --> 16:28.148
Wow. Good theory,
but the truth--

16:28.150 --> 16:30.312
I have much better things
to do with my time.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.118
You know, maybe if
the guy kept his pants on,

16:32.120 --> 16:35.681
He wouldn't have
these problems.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.658
The guy sleeps around, ok?

16:37.660 --> 16:39.480
Yeah. He has this whole
wholesome image,

16:39.490 --> 16:41.254
But he's not
the clean cut guy

16:41.260 --> 16:43.354
He pretends to be.

16:43.370 --> 16:46.567
All right?
We done here?

16:48.100 --> 16:49.465
What, are you gonna
arrest me?

16:49.470 --> 16:51.632
Because I'll cover it
for the evening news.

16:51.640 --> 16:54.940
I'll be my own
exclusive.

16:54.940 --> 16:56.430
John on tv: ...Strictly
on teacher performance

16:56.440 --> 16:59.171
To persuade the board
to raise teacher salaries.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.672
And it looks as if
tuition increases...

17:01.680 --> 17:02.818
I met with a few exes.

17:02.820 --> 17:04.617
They say john's
a charmer.

17:04.619 --> 17:06.839
None that would admit
to sleeping with him.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.146
What about adele?
Talk to her?

17:08.160 --> 17:12.050
She says they're not
having an affair.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.085
When was this
newscast?

17:14.099 --> 17:15.396
A couple months ago.
Why?

17:15.400 --> 17:17.323
Can you pause it?

17:18.900 --> 17:21.618
Look at adele's body
language when john talks.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.368
She watches him intently.

17:23.369 --> 17:29.036
Her eye contact indicates
an interest, an attraction.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.907
Notice
the tight-lipped smile,

17:31.910 --> 17:34.402
The shared look.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.013
They have a secret.

17:36.020 --> 17:38.148
You think adele
lied to me.

17:38.150 --> 17:39.413
Adele is married,

17:39.420 --> 17:41.309
And if she's got
a jealous husband--

17:41.320 --> 17:42.549
John could be
in danger.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.585
Well, that about wraps
it up for us tonight.

17:44.590 --> 17:46.752
Security cameras will be
installed tomorrow morning,

17:46.760 --> 17:49.627
And I'll be here tonight
patrolling the perimeter.

17:49.630 --> 17:52.827
Ok. Um, thank you.
Appreciate it.

17:52.830 --> 17:54.025
Good night, sir.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.997
Good night.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.729
[indistinct chatter on tv]

18:20.730 --> 18:23.529
[crowd cheering]

18:23.530 --> 18:25.464
[whistle blows]

18:49.460 --> 18:51.758
[knock on door]

18:59.830 --> 19:02.765
[beeping]

19:13.280 --> 19:15.305
[gunshots]

19:15.320 --> 19:17.914
[tires squealing]

19:27.530 --> 19:29.157
John: The bullet
grazed my shoulder.

19:29.160 --> 19:30.650
I have been in the
emergency room all night.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.058
Now I don't
understand

19:32.070 --> 19:33.595
Why this
is happening again.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.761
It wasn't
sam russell.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.740
He was in custody last
night. It's someone else.

19:37.740 --> 19:38.935
Well, then
who's doing this?

19:38.940 --> 19:40.237
Because the first time
this happened,

19:40.240 --> 19:41.901
It destroyed my life,
and I can't--

19:41.910 --> 19:43.309
I can't do this anymore.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.869
- Sam was an
initamcy-seeking stalker,

19:44.880 --> 19:48.510
And we believe whoever's
stalking you now is resentful.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.215
They're trying
to punish you.

19:50.220 --> 19:52.245
I--I haven't done
anything to anyone.

19:52.250 --> 19:53.740
Tell me about
keith bradshaw.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.387
We know he's not
a big fan of yours.

19:55.390 --> 19:57.119
Is he capable
of this?

19:57.130 --> 19:57.983
Keith?

19:57.990 --> 19:59.583
He assaulted you before.

19:59.590 --> 20:01.558
I know the guy
doesn't like me,

20:01.560 --> 20:04.689
But he wouldn't
shoot me, would he?

20:04.700 --> 20:06.964
What about
matt marshall?

20:06.970 --> 20:08.062
Adele's husband?

20:08.070 --> 20:10.095
Would he shoot you?

20:12.170 --> 20:13.240
You know about me
and adele.

20:13.240 --> 20:17.700
Yes. The question is
does her husband know?

20:17.710 --> 20:18.632
[sighs]

20:18.650 --> 20:19.799
I don't think so.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.175
Look. It only
happened once.

20:21.180 --> 20:22.579
Adele told me that
they were separated.

20:22.580 --> 20:24.617
When I found out
the truth, I broke it off.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.509
I would never fool around
with a married woman.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.579
It's just--
it's not me.

20:28.590 --> 20:30.251
How did adele take that?

20:30.260 --> 20:31.853
She was completely
professional

20:31.860 --> 20:34.079
As if it never
even happened.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.420
Look. I consider
her a friend.

20:35.430 --> 20:38.320
It's funny
how that happens.

20:38.330 --> 20:39.729
Was lauren in the picture
at the time?

20:39.730 --> 20:43.291
No. No. This was
well before we met.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.096
How is she?

20:44.110 --> 20:45.930
Well, when sam
showed back up,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.908
I, uh...

20:47.910 --> 20:50.402
I thought it best if
we take some time.

20:50.410 --> 20:53.072
I've been through this
before with my ex-wife,

20:53.080 --> 20:55.344
And I, uh...

20:56.220 --> 21:00.179
I just didn't want lauren
getting hurt because of me.

21:01.150 --> 21:04.415
Do you really think this
is someone that I know?

21:04.430 --> 21:05.727
Yeah, we do.
The stalker was

21:05.730 --> 21:07.880
In your daughter's bedroom
but chose not to hurt her.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.823
Instead, they filmed her
and perfectly timed

21:09.830 --> 21:13.027
The delivery of the video
to throw you off at work.

21:13.030 --> 21:15.397
This is personal.

21:24.440 --> 21:25.646
Beth.

21:25.650 --> 21:26.879
Adele, hi.
Hi.

21:26.880 --> 21:27.802
You must be matt.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.219
Do you mind explaining
why we were asked

21:29.220 --> 21:30.415
To come all the way
downtown?

21:30.420 --> 21:32.240
Of course. I need a
moment with your wife first.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.220
No. Whatever you have to say
to her you can say in front of me.

21:35.220 --> 21:36.551
That wasn't
a request.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.951
I need a moment
with your wife.

21:39.960 --> 21:42.088
It's ok.

21:45.500 --> 21:46.820
Please.
Thank you.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.697
Um, is this about john's
stalking investigation?

21:49.700 --> 21:53.807
John, told us you two
were in a sexual relationship.

21:53.810 --> 21:56.074
It was hardly
a relationship.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.434
Why'd you lie to us?

21:57.450 --> 21:58.337
I didn't lie.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.569
I was asked if we were
having an affair.

22:00.580 --> 22:04.175
We aren't. We had
sex once, that's it.

22:04.190 --> 22:05.544
And your husband's
aware?

22:05.550 --> 22:07.518
Matt isn't
stalking john.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.909
That's not what
I asked.

22:09.920 --> 22:14.050
Yes. I told him
after we slept together.

22:14.060 --> 22:16.757
And he wasn't upset?

22:16.760 --> 22:18.797
No. You see,

22:18.800 --> 22:22.794
Matt and I have
an open relationship.

22:22.800 --> 22:26.338
It's not something
we publicize.

22:35.950 --> 22:39.443
Do you know your wife
slept with john bardo?

22:41.560 --> 22:43.312
Yeah, I did.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.390
Have a seat.

22:44.390 --> 22:48.020
I told her about us.
It's ok.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.021
You have
an open relationship?

22:50.030 --> 22:52.692
In most of these
relationships, there are rules.

22:52.700 --> 22:54.259
Do you have set rules
as a couple?

22:54.270 --> 22:55.829
Only one.
We don't like to tell

22:55.840 --> 22:57.490
Anyone we have
an open relationship.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.899
Why did you tell john
that you were separated?

22:59.910 --> 23:02.675
Look. I lied to make
him feel comfortable,

23:02.680 --> 23:04.705
To give him permission
to be with me.

23:04.710 --> 23:07.247
John is
an amazing guy.

23:07.250 --> 23:09.241
He's really sweet,
very handsome,

23:09.250 --> 23:10.479
But the guy's
a prude.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.969
She told me
all about john.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.344
I appealed to john's
puritanical,

23:13.350 --> 23:16.115
Monogamous sensibilities
to get in his pants,

23:16.120 --> 23:17.918
But it soon became
very clear that he

23:17.930 --> 23:19.455
Was not gonna be
a good fit

23:19.460 --> 23:21.224
For matt and 1.

23:21.230 --> 23:23.995
Where were the two
of you last night?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.650
At home.

23:25.670 --> 23:29.391
Um, entertaining
a guest,

23:30.540 --> 23:32.463
His name is james thorpe.

23:32.470 --> 23:35.007
I can get you
his number.

23:37.610 --> 23:41.569
I'll never watch channel 12
news the same way again.

23:41.580 --> 23:42.650
Their alibis
checked out.

23:42.650 --> 23:44.118
James thorpe confirmed
he stayed

23:44.120 --> 23:45.884
At the marshalls'
last night.

23:45.890 --> 23:47.813
Sounds like it was
a hot time.

23:47.820 --> 23:49.413
He even described
their basement.

23:49.420 --> 23:52.060
Ben: Bingo! I've been
running the partial logo

23:52.060 --> 23:53.619
From the stalker video
through an algorithm

23:53.630 --> 23:55.280
That searches the internet
for known commerci--

23:55.300 --> 23:56.552
Ben, just get to
the important part.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.770
Yeah. It's
a bradbury university logo.

24:00.770 --> 24:01.828
Jack: It's in chicago.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.569
Keith worked in chicago
before he moved to |.A.

24:03.570 --> 24:06.335
Yeah. It's keith's
alma mater.

24:06.340 --> 24:07.933
Let's talk to him.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.136
Beth: Did you attend
bradbury university?

24:10.140 --> 24:12.404
That's public knowledge.
It's on my web site.

24:12.410 --> 24:15.812
Did you really need to bring
me down here to ask me that?

24:15.820 --> 24:16.969
I like to be thorough.

24:16.980 --> 24:19.039
In fact, you attend
football games regularly.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.849
We found these on your
self-promotional web site.

24:21.860 --> 24:26.320
You're wearing a bradbury
university logo on your sweatshirt.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.583
You got me.
I like football.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.694
You detectives,
you're really good.

24:30.700 --> 24:33.089
We also analyzed the video
that was sent to john

24:33.100 --> 24:35.194
By his stalker
two nights ago,

24:35.200 --> 24:36.463
And the person
who made that

24:36.470 --> 24:39.132
Is also wearing
the university's logo.

24:39.140 --> 24:42.360
I'm not the only person in
LA. That went to bradbury.

24:42.380 --> 24:44.530
No, but you might be
the only one who wanted

24:44.550 --> 24:46.541
The channel 12
news anchor job.

24:46.550 --> 24:49.815
You said that you were angry
when john got the position over you,

24:49.820 --> 24:52.243
So maybe you sent
the video freak him out

24:52.250 --> 24:54.742
So he'd take leave
like he did two years ago.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.012
That's certainly
flimsy.

24:56.020 --> 24:57.988
And when that didn't work,
you took a shot at him.

24:57.990 --> 24:59.060
All right.
Listen, lady.

24:59.060 --> 25:01.279
I don't have to stalk
someone or shoot them

25:01.300 --> 25:06.625
I got the anchor position
because I'm the better anchor.

25:06.630 --> 25:09.565
But you don't have
the anchor position, keith.

25:09.570 --> 25:13.006
John's not
stepping down.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.262
You trying to get
under my skin?

25:14.280 --> 25:17.932
Is that what you're doing,
just to see if I lash out?

25:17.950 --> 25:19.179
Is it working?

25:19.180 --> 25:23.811
I asked around. I heard
you have quite the temper.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.289
Where were you
last night?

25:26.290 --> 25:27.416
I was at home.

25:27.420 --> 25:29.479
Home? Were you alone?

25:29.490 --> 25:31.857
Yeah, I was alone.

25:31.860 --> 25:34.283
Are we done?

25:34.300 --> 25:35.893
Is it because he's
better looking

25:35.900 --> 25:38.153
Or simply because he's
the better anchor?

25:38.170 --> 25:39.899
Listen, lady!
That's it, ok?

25:39.900 --> 25:44.462
I'm gonna go above you, and
I'm gonna have your badge!

25:44.470 --> 25:46.768
[bang]

25:46.770 --> 25:47.862
[sighs]

25:47.880 --> 25:49.837
There is is.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.705
Beth: He's volatile
and impulsive.

25:54.720 --> 25:56.347
He has the biggest motive,
but we don't have

25:56.350 --> 25:57.613
Enough evidence
to hold him.

25:57.620 --> 25:58.678
The guy clearly
suffers from

25:58.690 --> 25:59.987
Narcissistic
personality disorder.

25:59.990 --> 26:02.140
But we can't prove that
he took a shot at john.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.152
Forensics found no gunshot
residue on keith's clothes,

26:05.160 --> 26:07.686
But they did find a latent
print on the shell casings

26:07.700 --> 26:09.088
Dropped at john's house.

26:09.100 --> 26:10.556
I checked,
and the print is linked

26:10.570 --> 26:12.629
To an fbi rap sheet
in illinois.

26:12.630 --> 26:13.529
Get it.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.794
I'm on it.

26:15.800 --> 26:17.529
What's wrong
with you?

26:17.540 --> 26:19.907
Beth, we need to talk.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.560
What is it?

26:21.580 --> 26:22.934
It's personal.

26:22.940 --> 26:24.499
What's personal?

26:24.510 --> 26:25.875
Ben.

26:25.880 --> 26:27.939
What's going on?

26:27.950 --> 26:31.318
The chief administrator at seattle
pacific psychiatric just called.

26:31.320 --> 26:35.518
She's been trying to reach
you on your cell for the last hour.

26:36.460 --> 26:40.988
Ray matthews was just
released this afternoon.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.150
What?

26:43.160 --> 26:44.298
No. How?

26:44.300 --> 26:46.359
An outside specialist
was brought in

26:46.370 --> 26:49.067
And provided
an assessment of ray.

26:49.070 --> 26:51.960
He signed off
on the release.

26:51.970 --> 26:54.940
Beth, I'm so sorry.

27:16.300 --> 27:18.257
When did it happen,
when exactly?

27:18.270 --> 27:21.626
The video was time-stamped
just after 4 p.M.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.462
I had
the video enhanced.

27:26.040 --> 27:28.600
Do we know
where they went?

27:28.610 --> 27:29.532
No.
Car?

27:29.540 --> 27:32.942
Rental, paid in cash,
returned on time.

27:32.950 --> 27:35.009
No trace.

27:41.090 --> 27:44.287
This kid has no idea
what he's just done.

27:44.290 --> 27:45.917
Perry hired
a forensic psychologist

27:45.930 --> 27:47.284
With a harvard ph.D
and citations

27:47.290 --> 27:49.952
From half the medical
boards in the country.

27:49.960 --> 27:51.496
We're figuring out
how--

27:51.500 --> 27:55.892
They were holding him on
an involuntary conservatorship.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.892
It wasn't ideal,
but it was all we had.

27:58.910 --> 28:02.403
Any specialist could
come in and evaluate him,

28:02.410 --> 28:05.710
Find him suitable
for release.

28:05.710 --> 28:06.871
Do the matthews know?

28:06.880 --> 28:09.076
They were notified,
as well.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.479
It talked them.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.642
They seemed terrified.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.880
They know
how dangerous he is.

28:14.890 --> 28:18.087
Perry's specialist apparently
filed an emergency motion.

28:18.090 --> 28:21.924
Took less than 48 hours
to get ray released.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.489
Beth...

28:29.500 --> 28:31.195
You're not alone
on this.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.735
They couldn't have
gotten far.

28:32.740 --> 28:35.004
We'll check airlines
and bus routes.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.171
I'll call seattle pd.

28:36.180 --> 28:39.775
No. I appreciate
what you're doing,

28:39.780 --> 28:40.440
But no.

28:40.450 --> 28:42.646
We have no proof
of perry's

28:42.650 --> 28:44.175
Illegal activity.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.149
But we do have evidence
of john bardo's stalker.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.788
He is the victim, and
he's who we need to be

28:50.790 --> 28:52.189
Focusing on right now.

28:52.190 --> 28:53.783
Beth, let us
handle this.

28:53.790 --> 28:55.189
Jack stop.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.419
We need to do
our jobs.

28:57.430 --> 28:59.398
Let's work.

29:01.870 --> 29:02.996
Where are we?

29:03.000 --> 29:04.832
What is going on,
beth?

29:04.840 --> 29:06.239
We're not gonna
talk about it now,

29:06.240 --> 29:08.368
But we will soon,
I promise.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.802
I'll fill you in later.

29:09.810 --> 29:12.507
We need to work
now, ben.

29:12.510 --> 29:14.740
Ok. I spoke
with the news director

29:14.750 --> 29:17.469
At the chicago station
where keith bradshaw worked.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.117
It seemed keith had
a female fan,

29:19.120 --> 29:20.747
A woman named
candice donovan.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.649
Keith sent out signed
photos and other gifts.

29:22.660 --> 29:25.357
When the fan escalated
and started stalking keith,

29:25.360 --> 29:27.249
He used it as a way
to self-promote.

29:27.260 --> 29:28.557
He thought it made
him relevant.

29:28.560 --> 29:30.096
The stalker started
making threats,

29:30.100 --> 29:31.420
And the entire studio
felt in danger.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.024
Keith was asked to resign
because of his part in it.

29:34.030 --> 29:36.931
No wonder he didn't tell
us about a previous stalker.

29:36.940 --> 29:38.396
He was worried about
losing his job again.

29:38.410 --> 29:41.300
And get this--one of the gifts
he used to hand out to his fans

29:41.310 --> 29:44.132
Were bradbury university
shirts.

29:44.150 --> 29:45.402
I just spoke
with chicago pd.

29:45.410 --> 29:47.401
The print we found
on the casing isn't keith's.

29:47.410 --> 29:48.673
It belongs
to a woman.

29:48.680 --> 29:49.909
Let me guess--
candice donovan.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.378
She was arrested for violating
a tro keith had against her.

29:52.390 --> 29:54.142
They're e-mailing
me the report.

29:54.160 --> 29:55.980
So she was stalking keith in
chicago and then came here

29:55.990 --> 29:57.879
And started
stalking john?

29:57.890 --> 29:59.119
Stalking's not
territorial.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.053
We see people travel
thousands of miles

30:01.060 --> 30:02.084
Across state lines.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.592
I just got the police report
on donvoan.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.262
Um, you guys
need to see this.

30:10.340 --> 30:11.967
Meet candice donovan.

30:11.970 --> 30:15.201
That's john's
girlfriend lauren.

30:15.210 --> 30:17.201
And with all that
sunshine in the forecast,

30:17.210 --> 30:19.702
It like it's gonna be
a beautiful week.

30:19.710 --> 30:22.372
Well, that about wraps
it up for us, folks.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.644
From all of us here
at channel 12,

30:24.650 --> 30:25.742
Have a pleasant evening.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.980
Stay tuned for
the "world news report,"

30:27.990 --> 30:29.913
Coming up next.

30:29.920 --> 30:32.651
Woman: And we're clear.

30:38.260 --> 30:41.025
Hey, john.
Can I grab your mike?

30:47.240 --> 30:48.332
Oht

30:48.340 --> 30:49.808
Whoa.

30:49.810 --> 30:52.177
Hey. Uh, john. Look.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.171
I know you've been going
through a horrible time,

30:54.180 --> 30:58.549
And, uh, I've been
a complete ass to you, so--

30:58.550 --> 31:02.589
Look. I just--I just
want this to be over.

31:02.590 --> 31:03.910
John.

31:03.920 --> 31:05.149
Yeah?

31:05.160 --> 31:09.256
I'm not stalking
you, man, I swear.

31:10.700 --> 31:12.555
Ahem.

31:30.750 --> 31:34.243
Ugh. Sss.

31:34.260 --> 31:36.149
[sighs]

31:40.060 --> 31:41.983
[exhales]

31:46.370 --> 31:47.326
Lauren, hey.
Hey.

31:47.330 --> 31:48.866
What are you doing
here, sweetheart?

31:48.870 --> 31:51.134
I just came by
to check on you.

31:51.140 --> 31:52.733
You know, I mean, after
everything you've been through,

31:52.740 --> 31:54.560
Shouldn't you have
taken some time off?

31:54.580 --> 31:57.208
Oh. Yeah, well,
this job's the only thing

31:57.210 --> 31:58.803
Keeping me sane.

31:58.810 --> 32:02.303
But you were supposed
to be in the hospital.

32:02.320 --> 32:03.674
You were supposed to
take time off.

32:03.680 --> 32:06.047
I mean, that's what you did
when you were stalked before.

32:06.050 --> 32:08.610
You took several
months off.

32:08.620 --> 32:09.815
What's wrong with you?

32:09.820 --> 32:11.288
Mental duress.
Remember?

32:11.290 --> 32:12.155
I looked it up online.

32:12.160 --> 32:15.380
What are--what are
you talking about?

32:15.400 --> 32:17.721
It's keith's turn now.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.459
We're done playing,
john.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.290
It's time for you
to go away.

32:21.300 --> 32:25.168
You should know
I actually liked you,

32:25.170 --> 32:28.299
But I love keith.

32:28.310 --> 32:29.630
Wait. Look, lauren.

32:29.640 --> 32:31.677
That's not my name.

32:31.680 --> 32:33.341
Look. Just--just--
just wait.

32:33.350 --> 32:34.806
John, do you have
a second?

32:34.820 --> 32:35.946
Adele, run!

32:35.950 --> 32:37.315
[gunshot]

32:37.320 --> 32:39.573
Unh!

32:39.590 --> 32:42.981
[adele screaming]

32:44.820 --> 32:45.912
Man:
Is anybody hurt?

32:45.930 --> 32:47.079
Woman: Go back
to your office!

32:47.090 --> 32:48.785
I'm gonna call
the police.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.689
[shouting]

32:50.700 --> 32:52.020
Ohh!

32:52.030 --> 32:54.692
Man: Somebody's
got a gun!

33:03.080 --> 33:05.003
[sirens]

33:05.010 --> 33:07.104
She's barricaded herself
inside of a dressing room

33:07.110 --> 33:08.248
On the north side
of the building.

33:08.250 --> 33:10.969
One hostage,
newscaster john bardo,

33:10.990 --> 33:12.640
Being held
at gunpoint.

33:12.650 --> 33:14.015
Are you getting
everyone else out?

33:14.020 --> 33:16.011
We're evacuating to
the parking lot right now.

33:16.020 --> 33:17.510
Where's
the control room?

33:17.520 --> 33:19.113
Right this way.

33:19.130 --> 33:20.382
Beth: John just finished
his newscast.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.882
He might still have
his mike on.

33:22.900 --> 33:24.459
Pull up john's mike.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.723
Oh. OKk.

33:26.730 --> 33:29.199
John: Lauren, whatever
your name is, this is crazy.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.793
Lauren: Don't
call me crazy.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.234
No. You're not crazy.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.335
They know you're here. You're
never gonna get out of this.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.308
Well, if I don't get
out, you don't get out.

33:37.310 --> 33:39.574
J-just lower the gun,
please, ok, hon?

33:39.580 --> 33:41.639
Ugh. Don't call me hon.
I hate it when you

33:41.650 --> 33:42.640
Call me hon.

33:42.650 --> 33:45.278
Only keith
calls me hon.

33:45.290 --> 33:47.782
Ok. Then--then you
go find him.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.315
Go find him.
Be with him.

33:49.320 --> 33:50.310
I'll stay here.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.515
John, this is beth davis.

33:51.530 --> 33:52.884
Listen to me.
Stop provoking her.

33:52.890 --> 33:54.688
She's delusional.
She thinks she's

33:54.700 --> 33:56.225
In a relationship
with keith.

33:56.230 --> 33:58.255
Affirm that.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.365
You're, uh, candice.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.769
You're keith's candice,

34:02.770 --> 34:04.260
The one he talks about.

34:04.270 --> 34:06.068
Yes. From chicago.

34:06.070 --> 34:08.129
Candice from chicago.

34:08.139 --> 34:09.630
How do you
know that?

34:09.639 --> 34:10.675
Beth: "keith told me."

34:10.679 --> 34:12.739
Keith talks about you
all the time.

34:12.750 --> 34:16.106
What has he
told you?

34:16.120 --> 34:17.975
Tell her.
You're doing great.

34:17.989 --> 34:19.411
She thinks she's
in love with him.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.717
That's why she's
doing this.

34:20.719 --> 34:24.213
Well...He told me how
much that you love him.

34:24.219 --> 34:25.415
It's incredibly romantic.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.922
I-I wish I had
someone like that.

34:28.929 --> 34:32.230
What keith and I have
is very special.

34:32.230 --> 34:34.221
How'd you meet?

34:39.070 --> 34:41.129
When we first met, we
were in my living room

34:41.139 --> 34:42.107
Back in chicago.

34:42.110 --> 34:44.909
Keith was out in the
field doing a report,

34:44.909 --> 34:46.309
And he was looking
right at me.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.902
He used to send
me messages,

34:47.920 --> 34:50.139
Secret messages
when he was reporting.

34:50.150 --> 34:54.188
He knew I'd be watching
the tv. I would understand--

34:54.190 --> 34:55.248
[thump]

34:55.260 --> 34:56.216
Somebody's outside.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.587
I'll kill him,
do you hear me?

34:58.590 --> 34:59.853
Tell them to stand down!

34:59.860 --> 35:00.884
Rescue team,
stand down.

35:00.890 --> 35:02.187
Get keith bradshaw
in here!

35:02.200 --> 35:03.690
No! Nobody's out there!

35:03.700 --> 35:04.849
How do you know?

35:04.870 --> 35:05.723
What are you doing?

35:05.730 --> 35:07.391
Is that something
in your ear?

35:07.400 --> 35:09.937
Oh. I will blow your
head off, so help me.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.294
Give it to me.
Give you what?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.436
The mike in your ear.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.169
John's still wired. Beth
will walk you through it.

35:14.170 --> 35:16.207
Wait. Tell her that keith
wants to talk to her.

35:16.210 --> 35:17.075
Ok. Wait, wait.

35:17.080 --> 35:20.072
Keith is--he's
in the control room.

35:20.080 --> 35:23.175
Yeah. He wants
to talk to you.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.714
Ahem. Um...

35:28.720 --> 35:29.744
Hello?

35:29.760 --> 35:31.182
Keith. Hey, man.

35:31.190 --> 35:34.125
Yeah. Hold on.
Candice is right here.

35:34.130 --> 35:38.749
Take this
and take this, too.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.420
Here. Talk to him.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.762
Go ahead.
Talk to him.

35:42.770 --> 35:46.331
Keith: Is this candice?

35:46.340 --> 35:48.434
Keith?

35:48.440 --> 35:51.899
Hey, baby. It's me.

35:51.910 --> 35:54.641
You know I really want
to be with you, right,

35:54.650 --> 35:57.950
But if you hurt john,
then--then we can't be together.

35:57.950 --> 35:59.213
"They'll put you
away forever.

35:59.220 --> 36:00.449
I don't want to
lose you."

36:00.450 --> 36:01.747
They'll put you
away forever,

36:01.760 --> 36:03.854
And, baby, I don't
want to lose you.

36:03.860 --> 36:07.728
I want you to put
the gun down.

36:11.800 --> 36:14.121
Agh! Unh!

36:14.130 --> 36:15.495
Initiate, initiate!

36:15.500 --> 36:17.059
Man on radio:
All teams, go!

36:17.070 --> 36:20.267
Move!
Drop it now!

36:20.270 --> 36:23.308
This is why you
don't understand.

36:23.310 --> 36:26.575
This was for keith.
I love keith.

36:28.610 --> 36:31.978
[music playing]

37:07.290 --> 37:12.080
Ben: So keith's stalker
followed him to |.A. From chicago.

37:12.090 --> 37:13.160
True love.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.925
[cell phone ringing]

37:23.370 --> 37:25.134
Hello?

37:25.140 --> 37:27.939
Ray: Hello, michelle.

37:27.940 --> 37:30.170
It's been a long time.

37:34.810 --> 37:37.279
I've missed you.

37:40.620 --> 37:44.011
Are you guys gonna
fill me in or what?

37:44.020 --> 37:46.079
Is perry with you?

37:46.090 --> 37:49.788
You already know the
answer to that, michelle,

37:49.800 --> 37:52.690
Or would you
prefer beth?

37:57.300 --> 37:58.768
Tell me where
you are, ray.

37:58.770 --> 38:00.829
I want to see you.

38:00.840 --> 38:03.730
And I want to see
you, too.

38:03.740 --> 38:06.710
Soon, michelle, soon.

38:13.290 --> 38:14.985
Beth?

38:16.890 --> 38:19.882
What is it?

38:19.890 --> 38:23.155
It was ray.

38:23.160 --> 38:26.528
[music playing]

38:38.940 --> 38:40.476
Everything looks fine.

38:40.480 --> 38:42.403
I'll be outside
in the car.

38:42.420 --> 38:44.639
Great. Thanks.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.754
[beeping]

39:08.210 --> 39:10.975
[knock on door]

39:16.180 --> 39:18.740
[beeping]

39:20.650 --> 39:21.788
I was gonna come alone,

39:21.790 --> 39:26.853
But they wouldn't take
no for an answer.

39:26.860 --> 39:29.921
Slumber party,
game night, movie.

39:29.930 --> 39:33.025
It's whatever
you want it to be.

39:33.630 --> 39:36.998
Ben: They told me.
I had no idea.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.094
I'm sorry, beth.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.204
Hope you like
pepperoni.

39:51.280 --> 39:53.044
You don't have to
do this.

39:53.050 --> 39:54.779
There's
a unit outside.

39:54.790 --> 39:56.610
You asked
for your help.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.883
This is help.

39:57.890 --> 39:59.255
[Janice laughing]

39:59.260 --> 40:00.557
Boo-yah!

40:00.560 --> 40:01.356
Here you go.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.057
In the form of beer
and pizza?

40:04.060 --> 40:06.825
It's not all
about you.

40:09.970 --> 40:12.735
Thank you.

40:12.740 --> 40:13.639
What we got?

40:13.640 --> 40:14.801
Ben: Get in on this.
Pepperoni.

40:14.810 --> 40:16.005
That's what I call
a party.

40:16.010 --> 40:19.401
Beth, grab it.
It's cold.

40:19.410 --> 40:22.801
[music continues]
