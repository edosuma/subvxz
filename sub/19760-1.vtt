01:29.089 --> 01:32.593
<i>As life progresses...
images blur.</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:38.167
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

01:40.934 --> 01:42.811
<i>Some of them true...</i>

01:42.936 --> 01:44.506
<i>- some of them false.</i>

01:46.740 --> 01:48.515
<i>I remember her well.</i>

01:49.509 --> 01:51.511
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

01:52.312 --> 01:54.121
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

01:55.115 --> 01:57.618
<i>In the old century,
you had to be...</i>

01:57.751 --> 01:59.753
<i>in order to survive.</i>

02:28.348 --> 02:30.851
Breathe in and out,
the way she does.

02:32.285 --> 02:33.958
And now push. Now!

02:48.168 --> 02:49.875
- Thank you so much.

02:51.505 --> 02:52.882
- Bye.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.877
- See you in a couple of days,
right'?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.499
Mama?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.271
Are you coming?

03:20.600 --> 03:22.320
- Good morning!
- 'Morning, Liz!

03:32.779 --> 03:35.419
Here, Ma.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.291
- Liz, the boy's gotta learn
how to shoot.

04:13.420 --> 04:15.457
- Well, he's gonna do it anyway.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.262
Better here than sneaking off
somewhere else.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.803
You're scaring your mother.
- She ain't my mother.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.566
- Beware of false prophets...

05:30.964 --> 05:34.343
who come to you
in sheep's clothing...

05:35.735 --> 05:39.342
for inwardly,
they are ravening wolves.

05:40.974 --> 05:45.081
Jesus is the shepherd who protects you
and your family from those wolves.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.520
And I am his dog.

05:50.350 --> 05:55.356
The sheepdog that gets the lambs back
on track when they stray off the path.

05:57.357 --> 06:01.203
And some of you have strayed...
haven't you'?

06:04.564 --> 06:06.441
What do you people think?

06:06.566 --> 06:09.376
That God is well-disposed towards you?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.372
Let me set things straight.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.782
Those who deserve it go to Hell.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.414
I could tell you about Hell.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.223
About its flames.

06:23.450 --> 06:24.952
About the pain.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.898
I'm sure you people
have tried to imagine what it's like.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.129
It's worse.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.974
Retribution is coming.

06:40.033 --> 06:43.810
Now... let us join in singing.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.049
Abide With Me.

06:48.308 --> 06:52.256
<i>♪ Abide with me</i> ♪

06:52.379 --> 06:57.158

07:08.762 --> 07:10.332
You alright?

07:16.236 --> 07:17.772
- Thank you.

07:39.492 --> 07:42.598
- How're you doing, sir?
This is my daughter, Sam.

07:42.696 --> 07:45.700
My boy, Matthew. And, uh...

07:47.133 --> 07:49.010
my wife.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.148
Where were you?

08:01.715 --> 08:03.786
That man's a stranger here.

08:03.883 --> 08:05.556
He doesn't know anybody yet.

08:05.685 --> 08:08.564
I'd have expected
a little more compassion from you.

08:08.688 --> 08:11.032
What's wrong'? What's wrong?

08:11.157 --> 08:13.967
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong'?

08:30.377 --> 08:33.381
- Just breathe, alright? Breathe,
just breathe.

08:33.513 --> 08:37.586
Everybody outside.
We don't need no busybodies.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.822
Go on, get. Get out!

08:39.919 --> 08:42.229
It's gonna be alright.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.598
- Nathan,
I think you better go outside too.

08:45.725 --> 08:48.934
Some things aren't meant
for a man's eyes.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.540
It's gonna be just fine, right, Liz?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.938
- You're gonna take care of her, right?
Promise?

09:00.540 --> 09:04.545
I'm going to be right outside, OK?
I love you. I love you.

09:07.180 --> 09:08.955
You take care of her.

09:09.849 --> 09:11.954
- Close the door behind you.

09:37.410 --> 09:39.583
It's gonna be alright, honey.

09:50.390 --> 09:53.064
- The baby's head's too big.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.303
- What's that supposed to say?

09:56.429 --> 09:59.467
- We're going to have to choose
between the baby and the mother.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.306
Can't save both of them.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.471
You have to.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.106
Your mother said
everything would be bleating...

10:14.013 --> 10:16.254
- No, I wanna stay. I wanna help.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.829
- Hey... how's it going in there?

10:30.263 --> 10:32.038
Everything alright?

10:33.032 --> 10:35.034
Yeah?

10:56.856 --> 11:00.497
- Push, Abby.
Hard as you can now. Come on!

11:12.071 --> 11:13.516
Good girl!

11:20.313 --> 11:22.190
- Where's the baby?

11:22.315 --> 11:25.091
I wanna see my baby.
Where is he?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.887
Give me my baby!

12:29.382 --> 12:30.918
- It ain't your fault.

12:34.153 --> 12:37.396
The Lord gives...
and the Lord takes away.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.603
- The Reverend?

12:49.402 --> 12:50.779
Liz...

12:51.971 --> 12:54.178
The Reverend is a man of God.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.616
You're seeing things that ain't there.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.646
- <i>If Jesus came back to life
after he was dead...</i>

13:24.437 --> 13:27.441
couldn't that happen
to Abigail's baby too'?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.986
Can you face-paint me?

14:22.261 --> 14:24.263
- I'm doing something.
Can't you tell?

14:53.092 --> 14:55.129
- We've come to see
if everything's alright.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.763
- Everything's just fine.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.103
No reason for you folks
to go wasting your time.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.971
- We'd like to look for ourselves.

15:03.102 --> 15:05.605
- Rather not.
There's a doctor coming in an hour.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.979
It's better if he takes a look.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.890
The Reverend arranged it.

15:29.128 --> 15:30.766
- Hello!

16:08.801 --> 16:10.610
- What the hell?
- Liz!!

16:14.607 --> 16:16.177
Liz!!

16:18.778 --> 16:20.815
You get down here, Liz!

16:22.381 --> 16:23.985
You get down here!

16:26.385 --> 16:28.387
I wanna see your face.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.827
I wanna see... your face.

16:47.640 --> 16:51.213
Nathan!!
Don't take it out on my boy!!

16:52.011 --> 16:55.151
We can talk about this
like decent folk!!

16:55.248 --> 16:58.195
- I got no quarrel with you, Eli!

16:58.851 --> 17:00.694
I'm here for your wife!

17:02.221 --> 17:04.428
She's gotta be punished for her sins.

17:05.424 --> 17:07.529
She's gotta burn at the stake, Eli!

17:07.660 --> 17:10.163
- Try to be reasonable now, Nathan!

17:10.262 --> 17:13.107
I know your sorrow, believe me.

17:13.232 --> 17:15.769
I lost a loved one too, remember'?!

17:16.234 --> 17:18.545
I know you're out of your mind
with grief,

17:18.671 --> 17:23.119
but believe me, your pain will <i>pass,</i>
just like mine did!

17:23.242 --> 17:25.449
- I could accept that real easy...

17:26.444 --> 17:30.257
as long as that tongueless murderess
ends up at the stake!

17:31.050 --> 17:33.462
I demand retribution!

17:37.256 --> 17:39.065
You know what she did, Eli?

17:41.694 --> 17:43.765
She murdered my baby boy.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.274
Before he could even be baptized,
she murdered him.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.611
What's gonna happen to him now?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.491
You think he's gonna find salvation?

18:07.720 --> 18:09.927
You know how she did it, Eli?

18:12.491 --> 18:14.095
I seen him.

18:17.296 --> 18:19.298
His brains had leaked out.

18:24.103 --> 18:26.105
Your wife broke his skull.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.812
She cracked his skull wide open!

18:31.944 --> 18:34.117
She should go to hell for this!

18:36.816 --> 18:38.318
- That will be enough.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.757
There has been suffering.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.792
It is the whiskey talking now.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.464
This is not the moment to solve this.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.336
- She belongs in hell, Reverend.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.798
- He do you any harm?

19:29.802 --> 19:32.180
He just helped us out of a real fix.

20:05.604 --> 20:07.277
- Do I get one too?

20:07.406 --> 20:09.511
- You ain't old enough for that yet.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.451
- Why be so hard on the boy?

20:12.044 --> 20:14.524
He only acted to protect his family.

20:14.613 --> 20:16.286
That makes him an adult.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.861
- His mother doesn't want him
playing with guns.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.956
- It's natural for a young man
to want to hold a rifle in his hands.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.234
May I offer my glass to Matthew?

20:42.074 --> 20:44.554
- I think it's about time
you went back to bed, Matthew.

20:44.643 --> 20:47.089
- Aw, Dad!
- Come on, drink up.

21:04.663 --> 21:08.634
- None of this would've happened if that
baby had been born in perfect health.

21:10.269 --> 21:13.148
- But Liz couldn't do nothing about that.

21:13.272 --> 21:17.152
- She decided who was to live
and who was to die.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.689
That decision belongs to God
and God only.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.924
Why did she not leave
that choice up to Him?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.924
- Maybe I should go fetch her.

22:16.335 --> 22:20.147
- I know you're there,
and I know you can hear me.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.183
You may have no tongue,
but there is nothing wrong with your ears.

22:31.750 --> 22:34.560
Why do doubts rise in your heart?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.933
Why are you troubled?

22:42.161 --> 22:44.402
How do you sleep at night?

22:46.732 --> 22:49.713
How does it feel to be a murderess?

23:01.247 --> 23:03.887
Do you know why I'm here?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.220
I'm hereto punish you.

23:11.257 --> 23:13.100
Do you love this family?

23:16.462 --> 23:18.601
I've looked at your daughter.

23:19.965 --> 23:22.411
She's almost a young woman already.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.718
- There you are.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.779
- I must be going.

23:34.046 --> 23:37.255
Please don't bear a grudge
against Nathan in your heart-.

23:38.117 --> 23:41.564
Losing a child is the worst thing
a body can go through.

23:42.621 --> 23:45.830
I was just talking to your wife
about that same thing.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.327
- You didn't even thank him.

24:17.856 --> 24:20.496
Fact is,
you didn't even say hello to him.

24:24.863 --> 24:28.106
- Oh, Liz, Nathan will come around.

24:36.108 --> 24:38.315
Right. You know what?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.356
Give me a couple of days.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.893
I'll get somebody to come in
for the sheep.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.325
And then we'll go up
to my pa's for a bit.

24:50.122 --> 24:52.329
He's all alone up there anyway.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.064
- Dad'?!

26:02.428 --> 26:03.873
Dad!

26:44.770 --> 26:48.013
- I'm just going to talk.
This has got to stop.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.484
First shootin' our windows up,
now this.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.249
Yah! Come on!

26:55.814 --> 26:57.316
Yah! Yah!

27:01.620 --> 27:03.691
I want you to stay
with your mother!

27:03.822 --> 27:05.495
- She ain't my mother.
- Matthew!

27:05.624 --> 27:07.626
- You're gonna need my help.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.836
- Alright,
as long as you stay outside.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.036
- But why can't I just play inside?

27:20.038 --> 27:21.847
- Why?

27:22.641 --> 27:25.053
- And why can't I help out?

28:46.358 --> 28:49.737
- Your mother won't mind.
She has a lot to do.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
Here, see?

28:57.369 --> 28:59.144
Everything will be fine.

29:01.373 --> 29:02.716
- And Mama?

29:02.808 --> 29:05.049
- She had to work in the barn.

29:05.143 --> 29:08.590
And she did not want you there.
Do you remember?

29:12.150 --> 29:14.960
I would like to talk to you
about your mother.

30:18.016 --> 30:19.654
- Nathan?

30:28.460 --> 30:30.235
- They've gone and moved.

30:43.675 --> 30:44.915
Liz?

30:45.043 --> 30:46.681
Where are you?

30:58.056 --> 31:00.730
No, no, Nathan's gone.
And Abigail.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.930
Packed up, moved out.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.588
Whoa. Where'd you get to, huh?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.957
You scared your mother.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.429
Had her worried sick.

32:04.156 --> 32:06.659
- Mama, are you evil?

32:08.560 --> 32:11.131
The Reverend said
you murdered a man.

32:13.131 --> 32:15.270
He says he's hereto punish you.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.937
To take you back
where he came from.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.883
Why?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.650
- Because she loves you.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.325
- Shoot me.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.295
Behind you.

38:58.536 --> 38:59.981
Please.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.080
Stop the pain.

39:55.793 --> 39:58.034
Take them to Grandpa.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.453
Mama?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.455
Mama?

40:56.854 --> 40:59.664
It was the Reverend.
He woke me up.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.304
Yah! Yah!

43:54.632 --> 43:57.272
- Joanna. My name is Joanna.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.348
- Frank!

44:42.079 --> 44:43.683
Frank!

44:44.515 --> 44:46.051
- Meng!

45:07.371 --> 45:11.012
Meng, you prosperous fucker, you.
Look at you.

45:11.108 --> 45:12.951
And what do we have here?

45:14.178 --> 45:17.557
- My name's Joanna.
- Well, it is a pleasure to meet you.

45:17.682 --> 45:21.357
Come on now, spin around,
let me get a look at you.

45:22.186 --> 45:23.859
There you are.

45:23.955 --> 45:25.798
Sally!
- Yeah.

45:25.923 --> 45:28.961
- Would you be so kind
as to treat Joanna here

45:29.093 --> 45:31.039
to a glass of cold lemonade?

45:31.128 --> 45:33.734
- Yeah, but of course.
Come, honey.

45:36.968 --> 45:40.074
- Alright, Meng,
let's talk fucking turkey.

45:43.941 --> 45:45.579
- Here you go.

45:52.216 --> 45:55.459
- Lookie here! Fresh meat.
- Swallow it right on down, girlie.

45:55.586 --> 45:58.089
Soon you'll be swallowing something else.

45:58.222 --> 45:59.895
- What's your name, girl?

45:59.991 --> 46:01.299
- Joanna.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.427
- Did your daddy bring you here?

46:03.995 --> 46:05.975
No? You sure?

46:06.097 --> 46:07.838
Didn't he just think
you were so good,

46:07.965 --> 46:10.912
he had to let the rest
of the world in on it too?

46:26.617 --> 46:29.154
- Hey. Whoa, there now,
where do you think you're going?

46:29.287 --> 46:30.664
- They're leaving without me!

46:30.788 --> 46:32.927
- Yes, they are,
but don't you worry about a thing,

46:33.024 --> 46:36.130
'cause from now on,
this is where you live, darling.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.262
Right here.

46:42.833 --> 46:46.679
Now, come on now.
Let's get you cleaned up.

47:30.314 --> 47:31.850
- Shhh, shhh!

47:40.358 --> 47:42.599
- Yeah, yeah!

47:43.561 --> 47:45.199
- So that's the work we do around here.

47:45.329 --> 47:48.936
And we do all the moaning and groaning
because that makes sure it's over faster.

47:49.066 --> 47:52.741
- Why?
- Why? That's what men like.

47:56.907 --> 47:59.683
So, uh... you ever bled yet?

48:01.879 --> 48:03.916
'Twixt your legs, honey.

48:04.548 --> 48:08.291
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You have, haven't you?

48:10.121 --> 48:12.192
Yeah'? Well, then,

48:12.289 --> 48:15.395
that's gonna be our little secret
for the time being. OK'?

48:16.727 --> 48:18.297
Now, you go to bed.

48:47.425 --> 48:49.427
- Ah!

48:56.934 --> 48:58.936
- And who are you?

48:59.069 --> 49:01.140
What's your name, girl?

49:02.139 --> 49:03.777
- Joanna.

49:05.943 --> 49:09.015
- Frank, what's it cost
to go upstairs with this one?

49:09.146 --> 49:11.649
- Come on now, Fred,
you cannot afford her.

49:11.782 --> 49:15.457
- Oh, I don't know about that.
I got pretty damn lucky at cards today.

49:15.586 --> 49:16.963
- Hey, Eastman!

49:17.788 --> 49:20.632
I'm horny as hell
and I feel like doing you!

49:20.758 --> 49:23.034
What would you say to a free ride, huh?

49:23.160 --> 49:25.936
- That ain't yours to decide.
- I'll pay for it myself.

49:26.030 --> 49:29.170
- Damn Sally, what,
you been holding out on me now, huh?

49:29.300 --> 49:32.645
- <i>I'll</i> go along with that.
But then she gets to watch.

49:32.770 --> 49:35.649
- No way.
- Then it's no deal.

49:35.773 --> 49:38.617
- Oh, it sounds like a fine idea to me.

49:39.543 --> 49:42.046
It'll be most educational, I'm sure.

49:55.826 --> 49:58.705
- What's wrong,
don't you like it, honeybunch?

50:05.469 --> 50:07.005
Oh, yeah.

50:07.872 --> 50:09.874
Hit me.

50:10.007 --> 50:12.009
- What?
- Hit me!

50:12.510 --> 50:15.582
- No, I ain't gonna do that.
- Hit me, goddammit!

50:17.214 --> 50:20.252
- Ah! I'm not taking this, Eastman.

50:20.985 --> 50:22.828
- Hit me again.

50:24.221 --> 50:25.598
Hit me again!

50:31.362 --> 50:33.569
- No, no, no, no, don't shoot!

50:33.697 --> 50:36.701
Don't shoot.
I don't mind it, Joanna.

50:36.834 --> 50:39.041
It's just a game, right'? Oh!

50:41.005 --> 50:43.246
- You do that again
and I'm going to shoot.

50:43.374 --> 50:46.878
- Please put the gun down.
- Don't you ever.

50:47.011 --> 50:49.423
Just keep pointing it at me.

50:52.683 --> 50:55.027
Don't you dare drop that gun on me.

50:56.053 --> 50:57.088
- Ah!

50:59.423 --> 51:02.427
- That's right. Keep pointing it at me.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.865
Don't you dare...

51:05.596 --> 51:09.066
I'm gonna strangle the life out of her!

51:13.237 --> 51:14.580
Shoot me!

51:18.242 --> 51:21.246
Do it, Joanna.
Shoot me, goddammit!

51:25.249 --> 51:27.559
Shoot, goddammit, bitch!

51:47.671 --> 51:50.948
You're gonna make a fine little whore,
I can see that already.

51:52.776 --> 51:56.588
I just bet that you can make me
real nice and clean too.

52:10.427 --> 52:13.806
- The whole world
may see our fair city of Bismuth

52:13.931 --> 52:16.639
as a place of Sodom and Gomorrah.

52:17.501 --> 52:19.447
But rules do apply here.

52:20.704 --> 52:24.880
A whore cannot be allowed
to shoot down her customers with impunity.

52:26.043 --> 52:30.014
My brother runs The Inferno
as a place where hardworking miners

52:30.147 --> 52:32.286
can find well-deserved recreation.

52:32.383 --> 52:34.829
That must remain so,

52:34.952 --> 52:36.659
and so it will.

52:50.734 --> 52:52.975
Let this be an example.

52:54.738 --> 52:56.684
No.

53:21.165 --> 53:23.042
- Come on now,

53:23.167 --> 53:26.842
a mining town has a need
for organized entertainment.

53:29.573 --> 53:32.918
And I need to know
that customers here feel safe.

53:33.043 --> 53:36.024
That's why I brought
my brother Zeke to Bismuth.

53:36.613 --> 53:39.116
He's a better sheriff
than this town deserves.

53:40.784 --> 53:44.926
Everybody at The Inferno knows that if a
girl so much <i>as</i> scratches a customer,

53:45.055 --> 53:46.864
she's gonna be punished.

53:47.424 --> 53:50.030
So Sally knew what she had coming.

53:51.195 --> 53:53.197
- But he strangled her.

53:54.598 --> 53:58.239
- Yeah, I know. It hurt me too.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.815
Damn, she was one of my oldest employees.

54:03.040 --> 54:05.213
But rules are rules.

54:05.809 --> 54:10.258
If you don't obey the rules, you're guilty.
And if you're guilty, you're gonna pay.

54:12.816 --> 54:15.456
You understand that, don't you? Hmm?

54:16.620 --> 54:18.429
Tell me you understand.

54:29.833 --> 54:33.679
You know how old I was
when I first went to bed with a girl?

54:37.074 --> 54:38.644
I was 21.

54:40.244 --> 54:41.655
Twenty-one.

54:42.846 --> 54:44.792
While Zeke, he was 14.

54:45.849 --> 54:47.954
I got to watch, though.

54:48.085 --> 54:50.861
I spied on him through the peephole.

54:55.459 --> 54:58.497
I never did see
what all the fuss was about.

54:59.263 --> 55:01.470
You know, what everybody talked about.

55:02.666 --> 55:04.475
I couldn't see it.

55:07.871 --> 55:09.873
You're not a child anymore.

55:13.877 --> 55:16.153
- I haven't been for a long time.

55:29.493 --> 55:31.131
- The time has come.

55:34.698 --> 55:36.507
I'm gonna be gentle.

55:58.322 --> 56:00.063
- That's right.

56:00.190 --> 56:03.194
Oh, stud, you sure are good.

56:03.327 --> 56:04.431
- Joanna!

56:04.561 --> 56:06.199
Joanna!

56:06.330 --> 56:08.037
Frank is in a gunfight!

56:08.165 --> 56:10.509
- Hey, what the hell?!
I'm almost done.

56:16.540 --> 56:18.076
- You see that?

56:18.208 --> 56:20.711
What do you say
we have her join us next time?

56:36.426 --> 56:38.963
- This is just between me and Frank.

56:39.897 --> 56:42.468
All I want is a fair fight.

56:42.599 --> 56:45.637
- Then what are you doing here?!

56:45.769 --> 56:48.613
- Blow him to hell!
- Yeah!

56:48.739 --> 56:50.650
- I'm not a violent man.

56:50.774 --> 56:53.380
I usually work with numbers.

56:55.045 --> 56:57.651
But now I'm standing here
in front of you...

56:57.781 --> 56:59.783
to shoot you dead, Frank.

57:00.217 --> 57:03.664
My daughter is dead because of you.

57:05.589 --> 57:08.661
It's men like you who think
their actions have no consequences,

57:08.792 --> 57:12.831
who are making the country
turn into what it's turning into.

57:15.265 --> 57:17.245
So for my daughter's sake...

57:18.068 --> 57:20.014
for every daughter's sake...

57:21.438 --> 57:23.475
I have to kill you.

57:23.607 --> 57:25.609
Because I'm a father.

57:27.244 --> 57:29.087
- So you can count.

57:29.813 --> 57:32.293
And you can sure as shit talk.

57:33.083 --> 57:35.290
But what we all wanna know is,

57:35.419 --> 57:37.421
can you shoot?

58:02.679 --> 58:04.886
- So when do we elope?

58:06.316 --> 58:07.886
- Where to?

58:08.618 --> 58:10.723
- Anywhere.

58:10.854 --> 58:13.300
Wherever we can be free.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.468
- But we are free here. Sort of.

58:18.662 --> 58:20.369
- No, we're not.

58:20.497 --> 58:22.499
And you know it.

58:25.469 --> 58:27.142
Face-paint me.

58:27.871 --> 58:29.145
- What?

58:30.474 --> 58:33.011
- Paint my face with your fingers.

58:50.827 --> 58:53.364
- You, uh, you remind me of my wife.

58:55.098 --> 58:58.375
But you dress better,
you smell better, you look better.

58:58.702 --> 59:00.340
- Thank you.

59:06.109 --> 59:08.248
- No fucking kissing.

59:08.378 --> 59:10.949
I said, no kissing!

59:13.350 --> 59:16.024
No kissing! Goddammit!

59:16.720 --> 59:20.930
- So you gonna buy me that drink, or what?
- Sure. Whiskey.

59:30.133 --> 59:34.047
- I warned you, you sonofabitch!
Nobody kisses me! Do you understand'?!

59:34.137 --> 59:36.310
- Fucking whore,
you bit my tongue off!

59:36.440 --> 59:39.284
Frank?! Frank'?!

59:39.409 --> 59:41.855
Oh, girl, you really
gone and done it now.

59:41.880 --> 59:43.472
I warned him six times!

59:43.580 --> 59:46.254
- Well, the fella you warned
is kind of important

59:46.383 --> 59:48.385
up at the gold mine.

59:49.753 --> 59:51.630
Now, I got me a whole saloon

59:51.755 --> 59:54.292
full of drunken fucking idiots
all howling for retribution!

59:54.424 --> 59:57.504
- Tell 'em to go fuck themselves. Give
them a drink on the house or something.

59:57.561 --> 59:59.802
- You think I'm gonna waste
my hard-earned money

59:59.930 --> 01:00:02.274
because you girls refuse
to obey the fucking rules'?!

01:00:02.399 --> 01:00:04.401
Get the fuck up! Come on!

01:00:05.469 --> 01:00:07.779
Get out there!
- Fuck you!

01:00:07.904 --> 01:00:10.441
Now where's Mike?!

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:13.486
- I demand retribution!

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.954
- You're gonna get it, Mike!

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:18.423
You see, the rules in Bismuth are clear,

01:00:18.515 --> 01:00:21.689
and all customers will get
the respect they got coming!

01:00:21.818 --> 01:00:24.094
- Hang the stupid whore!

01:00:24.187 --> 01:00:27.100
- No, no, Elizabeth here,
she's not gonna hang.

01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:28.999
Gotta hang her, Frank!

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.299
- Mike ain't dead neither, is he?

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:34.875
But he was a victim of her lawlessness,

01:00:34.998 --> 01:00:38.309
so he gets to make a fucking proposal.

01:00:38.435 --> 01:00:40.642
Now what's it gonna be, Mike? Huh?

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:44.115
You want this free pussy for a week?
Is that it?

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:49.479
- You cut that fucking bitch's tongue off!

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.630
- You want a trade, Mike, huh?

01:00:57.721 --> 01:01:00.861
You want an eye for an eye?
Is that what you want'?

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:18.046
- Rinse it five times a day with alcohol

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:20.553
and it should heal up
sooner than you'd think.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:22.987
No solid foods. No blow jobs.

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.355
- Will she ever be able to talk again?

01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:27.155
- Not much chance of that.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:28.854
Here you go.

01:01:31.054 --> 01:01:32.692
Goodbye.

01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:37.866
- I...

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:40.072
dance...

01:01:40.830 --> 01:01:42.741
on Tuesday?

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:46.279
I... only drink...

01:01:47.337 --> 01:01:49.180
on Tuesdays.

01:01:49.272 --> 01:01:51.274
I only drink on Tuesdays.

01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:55.884
I...

01:01:57.914 --> 01:01:59.257
kill...

01:02:00.517 --> 01:02:01.894
Frank?

01:02:03.086 --> 01:02:04.793
That's suicide.

01:02:08.525 --> 01:02:10.402
But they'll come after you.

01:02:10.527 --> 01:02:13.269
Besides, what're you gonna do?
Work in some other cathouse?

01:02:17.100 --> 01:02:18.943
Please don't do it.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:21.714
I couldn't stand to miss you.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:32.455
God sees each and every one of you.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:37.588
Don't think just because this is a lawless,
godless place

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:41.134
that your actions will go
without consequences.

01:02:43.727 --> 01:02:47.004
Ladies, do you want to end up in Hell?

01:02:48.331 --> 01:02:51.574
The nice clothing doesn't fool anybody.

01:02:52.736 --> 01:02:54.443
I know who you are,

01:02:54.571 --> 01:02:56.744
and I know what you are.

01:02:58.742 --> 01:03:01.621
What would your fathers think if they knew?

01:03:02.746 --> 01:03:04.953
Your mothers weep.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:09.792
Your fathers pluck out their eyes in shame!

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:27.672
- I've managed to find someone who doesn't
mind marrying a woman without a tongue,

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:30.216
but it will take some travelling.

01:03:30.774 --> 01:03:33.277
He's been a widower
since the last six months.

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:35.481
He's looking for a wife
who can cook

01:03:35.612 --> 01:03:38.115
and who doesn't mind
that he already has a son.

01:03:39.783 --> 01:03:42.627
No, I figured as much-.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.870
- "We will welcome you with open arms

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:51.666
and make sure you feel right at home
as quickly as possible.

01:03:51.795 --> 01:03:54.867
Respectfully yours," and so on and
so forth. And there's a picture.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.811
You're gonna have a real family.

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.250
How am I gonna do that?

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:12.823
We're sisters?

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.714
Frank would kill us.

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.848
No, you never know.

01:04:42.946 --> 01:04:44.755
And when you've convinced
your new husband,

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.259
you can pay for the stagecoach
from down there.

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:52.255
How long you think you'll need?

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:57.028
- You two gotta come right away.

01:04:57.127 --> 01:05:00.540
Some fella just paid a whole pile of cash
to buy out The Inferno.

01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:02.405
Get your asses moving.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.071
- Your last night
and you got to work too.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:12.477
- Alright now, listen up!

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:16.254
Usually we don't earn jack-shit
at the end of the month.

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:21.420
Jackie, shut the fuck up right fucking now,
or I'm gonna fucking make you.

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:24.795
This customer right here is a godsend,

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.629
and he bought the right
to all of y'all this evening-.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.738
And if he becomes a regular customer,
well, you can all expect

01:05:30.827 --> 01:05:32.932
a big, fat, fucking bonus,
courtesy of me.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.237
But I demand total commitment here.

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:39.973
I mean, whatever happens,

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:42.606
whatever the fuck he wants,

01:05:42.739 --> 01:05:44.912
he is gonna get it.

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.121
Now if anybody -

01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:53.751
I mean anyone -
does anything to ruin it for me...

01:05:55.752 --> 01:05:57.925
well, they gonna be punished.

01:05:59.522 --> 01:06:03.129
Shit, they're gonna be punished
worse than I've punished anyone before.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:07.442
But with that fucking said,
you do a good job, and, uh...

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.771
shit, he'll take you all.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.548
I want this one.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.791
- Hey.

01:06:41.898 --> 01:06:44.378
Alright now, come on!

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:48.805
You are gonna like this.

01:06:49.973 --> 01:06:52.476
That's right, there you are.

01:06:52.575 --> 01:06:54.213
My little doves.

01:06:59.382 --> 01:07:01.589
Now, will you look at that, huh?

01:07:02.418 --> 01:07:06.059
These two right here,
they're real young, real fresh.

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:08.260
Untouched, if you know what I mean.

01:07:08.391 --> 01:07:10.234
We got all kinds here.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:13.838
We've got Chinese,
if you like that kind of thing.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:17.510
Oh, this one here, she's Jackie.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.410
Jackie likes you, I can tell.

01:07:21.204 --> 01:07:23.275
We've got anything you want here.

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.386
All your heart's desire.

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:28.045
Right here in The Inferno.

01:07:28.878 --> 01:07:31.552
Oh, this one here,
well, she got a fire in her.

01:07:31.681 --> 01:07:34.855
I had to cut out her tongue
just to keep her in line.

01:07:36.419 --> 01:07:38.626
Good thing she can't talk back.

01:07:45.428 --> 01:07:49.069
Oh, you have fine taste, sir.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.646
This one right here,
well, she is a mystery to me.

01:07:54.437 --> 01:07:57.384
I bought her from a band
of travelling gypsies.

01:07:57.473 --> 01:07:59.475
You know, colourful types.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:01.722
- Uh-huh.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:04.417
- Damn,
I don't even know her real name.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:38.684
- She's the one.

01:08:39.115 --> 01:08:42.823
- Well, that's an excellent choice, sir.
May I suggest a couple of other gi...

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:44.488
- Only her.

01:08:44.921 --> 01:08:47.367
- But you paid for the whole Inferno.

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:49.765
- I paid not to be seen doing this.

01:09:28.131 --> 01:09:30.542
This evening has cost me a lot of money.

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:36.582
Is there something wrong with your voice?
Can't you talk?

01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.983
- Yes, I can.

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.031
Would you like me to dance for you?

01:10:10.907 --> 01:10:13.183
- I had to wait a long time to find you.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.247
I am very disappointed.

01:10:16.379 --> 01:10:18.791
I had considered many things,
but not this.

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.526
Is this what you wanted?

01:10:25.388 --> 01:10:27.197
What you looked for?

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:39.046
I am prepared to forgive all your sins.

01:10:39.402 --> 01:10:43.441
I have also sinned.
I am going to burn in Hell forever.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.281
I gave up the right to go to Heaven.

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:49.986
But you made me do it.

01:10:51.814 --> 01:10:54.055
And only you can save me.

01:11:06.429 --> 01:11:07.931
- No.
- Yes.

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:11.136
I have sinned because
we should've finished the ceremony first.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.474
Paul the Apostle wrote it
in the First Corinthians.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.947
Help me, Joanna.
- I can't.

01:11:16.072 --> 01:11:17.779
- Then we shall both burn in Hell.

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:20.786
I am here to save you
so that you can save me.

01:11:23.646 --> 01:11:26.126
I will make you do it.
You know I will.

01:11:26.249 --> 01:11:28.126
- I won't let you do that again.

01:11:28.251 --> 01:11:30.094
I'll kill you first.

01:11:31.854 --> 01:11:34.596
- I tried.
You leave me no choice.

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.496
- Help! Somebody! Ah!

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:41.131
Somebody, help!

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:43.540
- You are mine!
It is God's will!

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.112
- Help!

01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:52.450
Get out!

01:11:58.114 --> 01:11:59.491
You whore!

01:12:14.697 --> 01:12:16.904
You're coming with me tonight.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.944
- I need your help.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:08.282
- You're not gonna get me
into trouble, are you'?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:46.482
Are you sure about this?

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:48.818
Alright.

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.535
I can't do this!

01:15:45.107 --> 01:15:47.383
- Are you Elizabeth Brundy?

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.565
- Are you sure
you're up to making this trip?

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.567
Well, good luck.

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:14.780
Don't let anyone see that for a while.
It's still pretty fresh.

01:20:13.609 --> 01:20:18.388
And forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us.

01:20:18.514 --> 01:20:20.118
And lead us not into temptation;

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:22.286
but deliver us from evil.

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:25.695
For thine is the kingdom
and the power and the glory,

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.960
forever and ever.
Amen.

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:49.749
- Ahem.

01:20:51.914 --> 01:20:53.222
Tonight.

01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:02.066
Joanna is still speaking Dutch.
I hold you responsible for that.

01:21:02.658 --> 01:21:05.161
- I'll pray for the Lord's assistance.

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.741
- As a wife, you have your duties.

01:21:09.264 --> 01:21:12.177
"The wife does not have authority
over her own body,

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:15.510
but yields it to her husband.“
Please come with me.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.246
- Not tonight.

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:23.687
- You leave me no choice.

01:21:56.111 --> 01:21:58.785
<i>We know why we came here.</i>

01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:01.053
<i>This is God's nation.</i>

01:22:01.150 --> 01:22:05.929
<i>The Lord shed his grace
on this beautiful new country.</i>

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:10.226
This was our Exodus.
In this city on a hill,

01:22:10.325 --> 01:22:14.569
we will develop a purer form
of Christianity.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:20.440
Hadn't we all agreed
to leave the old language behind?

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:24.442
Hadn't we sworn
to do things better over here?

01:22:24.573 --> 01:22:28.612
The new world would free us
from the sins of the old.

01:22:30.279 --> 01:22:34.125
We are the bright hope of humanity.

01:22:34.249 --> 01:22:36.126
This is the Promised Land,

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:40.427
and by coming here,
we have become His chosen people.

01:22:42.124 --> 01:22:45.799
Agatha, would you tell everyone
how you received the calling?

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:52.339
- I was at home, peeling potatoes,

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:55.005
when this huge white light appeared.

01:22:55.838 --> 01:23:00.378
In that light, I saw a beautiful young man
with white wings.

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.785
I asked if he was an angel,

01:23:03.879 --> 01:23:07.019
and the young man nodded and smiled.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.492
- Hmm.

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:11.858
Arie, would you be so kind

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:14.991
to share your story
of witness with us?

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:20.735
- For me, it was more or less
the same thing,

01:23:20.863 --> 01:23:23.139
but it wasn't a man.

01:23:23.232 --> 01:23:27.806
It was a beautiful young woman
who showed herself to me.

01:23:29.505 --> 01:23:32.645
- You see?
We are the chosen people.

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:35.017
A visitation like that
is not something that happens

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:37.521
to just anybody.
You have to earn it.

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:45.162
Anna, would you please
come to the front?

01:24:02.037 --> 01:24:03.914
What about you, Anna?

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.451
Have you received the calling yet?

01:24:09.244 --> 01:24:12.248
- I have not been blessed in such a way.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:17.455
- In our community, everyone of age
has received such a calling; you have not.

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:22.929
What did you do, Anna,
to... anger God this much?

01:24:26.461 --> 01:24:31.274
My own wife,
who cannot find the Lord's favour.

01:24:32.467 --> 01:24:34.242
I am ashamed of you.

01:26:29.084 --> 01:26:32.998
- Father, I pray that my wife
will grow in her love for you,

01:26:33.088 --> 01:26:34.567
and me.

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:39.730
May she love us with all her heart, all
her soul, all her mind and all her might.

01:26:39.861 --> 01:26:44.071
Give me the strength to lead her
to the salvation provided by your grace.

01:26:44.199 --> 01:26:47.203
In Jesus's name... Amen.

01:28:46.488 --> 01:28:48.729
You must wash your daughter.

01:28:49.457 --> 01:28:51.232
She is unclean.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:29:01.174
- But he never raises a finger
to help out,

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.648
- It's a woman's fate.

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:07.242
- Says who?

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.082
- Says the Bible.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.748
- It's not fair.

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:15.560
- Your father's a man of the cloth.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:18.528
He serves God
and leaves earthly chores to his wife.

01:29:20.422 --> 01:29:22.060
What do you want?

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.329
- Leave us alone,
I have to talk to the girl.

01:29:37.539 --> 01:29:40.782
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.587
- Yes.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:47.421
- The blood has penetrated into your life
and driven out the innocence.

01:29:47.549 --> 01:29:51.224
It won't be long before men
start to find you attractive.

01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:58.296
Woman! I know you're listening.

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:00.804
From now on,
you must treat Joanna like a woman.

01:30:01.696 --> 01:30:03.607
As of today, you will do the hogs.

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:48.613
Hello, lady.

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:03.769
I saw the pump.

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:05.997
I was hoping you'd be kind enough...

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.368
to let me quench my thirst.

01:31:30.885 --> 01:31:34.560
Allow me to express... my deepest thanks.

01:31:34.689 --> 01:31:36.566
- Where are you men from?

01:31:36.691 --> 01:31:38.830
- Oh, that's a long story.

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:41.569
Maybe some other time.

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:46.341
- What about him?
- You take care of him.

01:31:46.468 --> 01:31:49.244
After all, you are a Christian, I assume?

01:31:51.206 --> 01:31:52.913
God damn me.

01:32:20.368 --> 01:32:21.847
Get the horse.

01:32:21.936 --> 01:32:23.847
- My parents will find you two.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:29.120
- Then get... the goddamn saddle.

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.762
Go!

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:43.193
Go on, get out of here! Go on!

01:32:54.402 --> 01:32:56.780
- Damn bullet needs to get taken out.

01:33:01.242 --> 01:33:03.244
And I need taking care of too.

01:33:03.778 --> 01:33:05.587
- My father wouldn't like that.

01:33:05.713 --> 01:33:07.454
- Yeah...

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:10.461
You know what?
Don't fuckin' tell him.

01:33:33.174 --> 01:33:34.619
- Here it comes.

01:33:58.099 --> 01:34:02.479
- I reckon... it's about time
I introduced myself.

01:34:05.507 --> 01:34:06.781
I'm Samuel.

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:10.281
It's nice to meet you...?

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:13.689
- Joanna.

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:16.686
Thank you.

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.506
- The girl is growing fast.

01:34:58.593 --> 01:35:00.573
- Hi, sweetie.

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:02.402
- He's running a fever.

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:03.838
- Are you sure?

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:06.435
'Cause they say the best way
to take someones temperature

01:35:06.568 --> 01:35:08.343
is with the lips, huh?

01:35:27.889 --> 01:35:29.891
- How old are you now, child?

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:32.302
- Thirteen.

01:35:36.431 --> 01:35:39.037
- A full-grown woman has...

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:42.307
has duties in life
that a young girl can't fulfill.

01:35:44.439 --> 01:35:47.579
Duties imposed by our Lord himself.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.082
Come with me, please.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:10.069
Your mother does not always
assume responsibilities the way she should.

01:36:10.164 --> 01:36:13.611
She does not comply
with her natural duties.

01:36:14.836 --> 01:36:16.679
Do you understand what I mean?

01:36:20.942 --> 01:36:24.617
God has made you a woman
so soon for a reason.

01:36:25.513 --> 01:36:29.188
You might believe it to be a curse,
but He has a reason for everything.

01:36:30.485 --> 01:36:34.023
You have, as the apostle Paul put it,

01:36:34.155 --> 01:36:36.635
"passed the flower of your age."

01:36:36.758 --> 01:36:38.362
- This is not right.

01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:41.363
- You have seen the blood.

01:36:43.031 --> 01:36:44.704
- She's just a child.

01:36:47.201 --> 01:36:50.341
- I need not answer to you.
Only to God.

01:37:28.209 --> 01:37:30.246
No, thank you, Anna.

01:37:30.378 --> 01:37:32.255
God has other plans.

01:37:59.674 --> 01:38:01.085
- It'll be alright.

01:38:03.678 --> 01:38:05.282
Use both hands.

01:38:08.049 --> 01:38:10.029
Don't let the blast scare you.

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:13.288
- You're a grown woman now, Joanna.

01:40:14.575 --> 01:40:16.646
- Could I talk to you for a moment?

01:40:24.252 --> 01:40:26.232
I want to offer my apologies.

01:40:26.988 --> 01:40:30.231
I withheld from you
that to which you have a right.

01:40:30.358 --> 01:40:32.235
That was wrong of me.

01:40:34.529 --> 01:40:37.066
- Apology accepted.
- Let me make it up to you.

01:40:39.033 --> 01:40:40.876
- It's too late for that.

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.881
- I have seen how you look at her.

01:40:46.207 --> 01:40:47.880
She's your own daughter.

01:40:55.950 --> 01:40:57.395
It's a sin.

01:40:57.518 --> 01:40:59.395
- It does not have to be.

01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.194
"If any man thinks
that he is behaving himself unseemly

01:41:02.290 --> 01:41:05.066
toward his virgin daughter,
if she pass the flower of her age,

01:41:05.192 --> 01:41:07.900
and if need so requires,
let him do what he will;

01:41:08.029 --> 01:41:10.566
he is not sinning; let them marry.“

01:41:17.371 --> 01:41:18.941
- You shall be scolded.

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:20.245
" No!

01:41:32.386 --> 01:41:33.797
Good girl.

01:42:04.352 --> 01:42:06.525
- That sure as hell took long enough.

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.997
- Where are you going?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:12.763
- Gonna take a crap.

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:17.142
- Where you want me to put this?

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:20.768
- I need some rope and I need it fast.
Can you get that for me?

01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:22.977
Good.

01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.507
I had to do that.

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:38.773
If I hadn't,
he'd have killed me at some point.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.642
Better him than me, I'd say.

01:44:44.678 --> 01:44:47.022
I heard that story once.

01:44:47.748 --> 01:44:50.422
The one about turning
the other cheek and all that.

01:44:52.319 --> 01:44:55.027
The only person who'd say
something like that

01:44:55.156 --> 01:44:57.966
is someone who's in control.

01:44:59.293 --> 01:45:02.137
Someone who doesn't want you
to stand up to him.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.771
I've seen your mother.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:12.182
She's the kind of person
that turns the other cheek.

01:45:13.874 --> 01:45:15.478
Are you like her?

01:46:09.196 --> 01:46:13.576

<i>♪ O abide with me</i> ♪

01:46:37.892 --> 01:46:40.236
Why do you let him do this?

01:46:42.029 --> 01:46:43.906
I'll never be like you.

01:46:44.031 --> 01:46:45.772
This is no way to live.

01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:50.439
I'd rather die first.

01:47:16.664 --> 01:47:18.166
- The serpent said to the woman,

01:47:18.299 --> 01:47:20.301
"You surely will not die!

01:47:20.434 --> 01:47:23.938
For God knows that in the day you eat
from it, your eyes will be opened,

01:47:24.071 --> 01:47:27.678
and you will be like God,
knowing good and evil."

01:47:27.808 --> 01:47:30.789
And when the woman saw
that the tree was good for food,

01:47:30.911 --> 01:47:32.447
and was a delight to the eyes,

01:47:32.579 --> 01:47:36.152
and that the tree was
desirable to make one wise,

01:47:36.283 --> 01:47:39.093
she took from its fruit and ate.

01:47:40.521 --> 01:47:43.161
And then the Lord God
said to the woman:

01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:46.499
"I will greatly multiply
your pain in childbirth,

01:47:46.627 --> 01:47:48.868
In pain you will bring forth children;

01:47:48.996 --> 01:47:53.103
Yet your desire will be for your husband,

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.202
And he will rule over you.“

01:48:02.676 --> 01:48:04.349
This is an abomination.

01:48:06.013 --> 01:48:07.720
This is an abomination!

01:48:08.482 --> 01:48:11.793
Does she not know that her body is
the temple of the Holy Spirit,

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:14.491
which she received from God?

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:16.623
This is a disgrace.

01:48:16.724 --> 01:48:19.170
She will be punished in Hell.

01:48:19.293 --> 01:48:22.502
She will be transformed
into a thorny tree,

01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:26.167
and in a tortured wood,
she will be punished by harpies,

01:48:26.300 --> 01:48:28.712
who will dig their sharp talons into her,

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:31.373
until the blood comes flowing down!

01:48:35.509 --> 01:48:36.544
O Lord.

01:48:37.344 --> 01:48:38.846
Forgive me.

01:48:38.979 --> 01:48:42.517
You know I have tried to keep her
on the narrow way to repentance.

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:47.359
The way is broad that leads to destruction.

01:48:47.888 --> 01:48:49.925
I spoke to her.

01:48:50.691 --> 01:48:52.432
I chastised her.

01:48:55.029 --> 01:48:56.838
But to no avail.

01:48:59.233 --> 01:49:00.541
I failed.

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.398
- There, there.

01:49:53.487 --> 01:49:54.989
It's alright.

01:49:55.789 --> 01:49:57.427
It's alright.

01:50:10.604 --> 01:50:12.242
- I'm old enough.

01:50:15.909 --> 01:50:17.411
- I know.

01:50:58.819 --> 01:51:01.026
- God has forgiven me.

01:51:01.355 --> 01:51:02.857
I am ready.

01:51:14.334 --> 01:51:17.338
<i>Thank you, Lord,
Thank you, Almighty.</i>

01:51:17.471 --> 01:51:19.883
<i>You saw, and foresaw ail.</i>

01:51:20.240 --> 01:51:24.052
<i>You saw that my wife did not do
what you expected of her.</i>

01:51:24.178 --> 01:51:27.682
That she did not love you, or me,
as my daughter will.

01:51:28.315 --> 01:51:31.762
Lot lay with their daughters
and they bore children unto him.

01:51:31.885 --> 01:51:34.832
Joanna and I shall enter
a state of matrimony

01:51:34.922 --> 01:51:37.095
and she shall bear my children.

01:51:37.224 --> 01:51:39.898
We shall be joyous and honour you.

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:41.904
- Ah! Let me go!

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:44.009
Fear not.

01:51:44.097 --> 01:51:46.407
- No!!! Ah!!

01:51:46.533 --> 01:51:48.035
No!!

01:51:48.168 --> 01:51:51.672
- It is the will of God.
We are his chosen ones.

01:51:51.772 --> 01:51:55.413
When two people make their vows
in the name of the Everlasting,

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:58.853
they pronounce their wish
to belong to each other, fully in love.

01:51:58.946 --> 01:52:02.587
Together they shall search
for what God wants from their lives.

01:52:02.716 --> 01:52:06.721
Together they shall perform their duties
and care for their family.

01:52:32.613 --> 01:52:34.923
- My father was a real bastard.

01:52:35.048 --> 01:52:39.258
Used to put cigars out on my arm,
the sadistic fuck.

01:52:41.154 --> 01:52:44.158
And he was a pervert, just like you.

01:52:45.225 --> 01:52:48.069
I killed him when I was nine years old.

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:49.640
- Who are you?

01:52:50.397 --> 01:52:53.173
- You have a real special daughter.

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.807
She deserves to be free.

01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:06.246
- You think you can come in here
and take that which belongs to me?

01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:10.194
- Yeah. What do you think?

01:53:10.784 --> 01:53:13.424
That God's gonna come down here
and save you'?

01:53:19.359 --> 01:53:23.603
- I am as God. He is as I am.

01:53:34.875 --> 01:53:36.445
I will love you.

01:53:36.543 --> 01:53:38.454
And you will learn to love me.

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:40.786
It is God's will.
- I will kill you!

01:53:40.881 --> 01:53:43.885
- That would not stop me.
- You're mad!

01:53:44.017 --> 01:53:47.658
- Who was that man?
He put foolish thoughts in your mind.

01:53:47.788 --> 01:53:50.234
- He helped me. I love him!

01:53:52.292 --> 01:53:54.533
- No, you do not.

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:56.504
It is lust.

01:53:58.699 --> 01:54:00.042
- Yes.

01:54:05.372 --> 01:54:07.579
- I will beat your mother out of you.

01:54:33.533 --> 01:54:36.377
The time has come.

01:54:36.503 --> 01:54:38.380
I will be gentle.

- I'll be fine.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:49.652
Are we there yet?

02:01:12.398 --> 02:01:14.469
Ah!! Ah!

02:01:15.268 --> 02:01:17.305
What was that?

02:01:17.437 --> 02:01:19.576
No, let me go!

02:01:19.672 --> 02:01:21.811
- Stay there!
- Matthew!

02:01:21.941 --> 02:01:24.148
- Stay there, Sam!
Whatever happens!

02:01:24.277 --> 02:01:25.813
- Matthew!

02:01:28.148 --> 02:01:29.627
Ah!!!

02:01:31.684 --> 02:01:33.288
Mama!

02:01:35.488 --> 02:01:36.967
Matthew!

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:36.612
- Oh, Liz...

02:03:37.744 --> 02:03:41.886
I'd always hoped
this place would be Eli's someday.

02:03:44.317 --> 02:03:45.625
I mean...

02:03:45.752 --> 02:03:47.993
he could've...

02:03:48.121 --> 02:03:49.725
I don't know...

02:03:49.822 --> 02:03:52.302
a sawmill or something...

02:04:16.582 --> 02:04:18.459
Are you sure?

02:04:18.584 --> 02:04:21.155
You ever fired one of those things before?

02:04:25.825 --> 02:04:28.305
- I should be the one holding the gun.

02:05:03.896 --> 02:05:06.308
- There's no use shooting
from that distance.

02:05:17.577 --> 02:05:20.387
It's more difficult than you think,

02:05:20.513 --> 02:05:22.857
especially with a gun like that.

02:05:35.895 --> 02:05:39.035
I was truly prepared to forgive you,
back in Bismuth.

02:05:40.433 --> 02:05:41.844
I loved you.

02:05:41.934 --> 02:05:44.039
You should have seen that.

02:05:48.207 --> 02:05:49.948
You've turned against me.

02:05:51.177 --> 02:05:52.713
Just like your mother.

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:57.459
But again, I have been provided
with an alternative.

02:06:00.953 --> 02:06:02.796
That's right, Joanna.

02:06:03.956 --> 02:06:06.129
Your daughter shall
suffer for your actions.

02:06:08.027 --> 02:06:11.941
And I will make you watch
<i>as</i> I chastise her.

02:06:12.065 --> 02:06:15.239
And after that, you will witness
how I make her a woman.

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:20.413
You believe she's safe in there?

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.480
That I cannot get to her?

02:06:24.610 --> 02:06:26.988
You left her alone, Joanna.

02:06:27.413 --> 02:06:29.893
Never leave your loved ones alone.

02:06:29.982 --> 02:06:31.723
You should know that by now.

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:39.327
What is the worst thing
I could do to you, Joanna?

02:06:41.260 --> 02:06:43.467
Lucky for her, she was asleep.

02:06:43.596 --> 02:06:45.507
She did not see a thing.

02:07:00.646 --> 02:07:02.455
Huh'? What?

02:07:24.637 --> 02:07:27.846
- Beware... of false prophets...

02:07:28.941 --> 02:07:32.286
who come to you in sheep's clothing.

02:07:33.613 --> 02:07:37.288
For inwardly...
they are ravening wolves.

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:10.190
- Mama! Ah!

02:08:11.517 --> 02:08:13.724
No! Mama! Mama!

02:08:13.853 --> 02:08:15.230
No!!

02:08:20.359 --> 02:08:22.396
Mama!

02:08:22.528 --> 02:08:24.030
Mama!

02:08:46.118 --> 02:08:49.565
- I will do to your daughter
exactly as I did to you.

02:08:53.092 --> 02:08:55.698
I am going to hurt you
as much <i>as</i> I can.

02:09:02.535 --> 02:09:06.312
<i>♪ Abide with me</i> ♪

02:09:06.439 --> 02:09:11.946
<i>♪ Fast falls the eventide</i> ♪

02:09:37.403 --> 02:09:39.610
I will leave the door open.

02:10:16.342 --> 02:10:17.980
I brought you this.

02:10:24.383 --> 02:10:27.660
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

02:10:29.822 --> 02:10:33.497
Many people believe that God
does not approve of violence.

02:10:34.827 --> 02:10:37.330
They have not read their Bible.

02:10:37.463 --> 02:10:41.138
"Violence cleanses evil.
It purifies the heart."

02:10:42.802 --> 02:10:45.043
Does your heart need purifying?

02:10:46.405 --> 02:10:48.180
Have you had bad thoughts?

02:10:49.408 --> 02:10:51.251
About men, perhaps?

02:10:53.679 --> 02:10:55.056
Do you like men?

02:11:02.488 --> 02:11:04.263
Have you bled yet?

02:11:23.175 --> 02:11:25.519
I am a doomed man, Sam.

02:11:27.279 --> 02:11:28.917
Beyond salvation.

02:11:29.048 --> 02:11:31.961
I can do whatever I want.

02:11:37.957 --> 02:11:40.904
Young girls still carry
the scent of innocence.

02:11:42.428 --> 02:11:45.534
Older women smell different.

02:11:56.742 --> 02:11:58.380
The time has come.

02:12:46.325 --> 02:12:49.772
People think it's the flames
that make Hell unbearable.

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:52.870
It's not.

02:12:54.133 --> 02:12:56.306
It is the absence of love.

02:14:02.368 --> 02:14:03.540
. Hey-

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:09.451
Mm-hmm.

02:14:38.871 --> 02:14:42.978
- Well... longtime no see, Liz.

02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:52.725
I was a broken man.

02:14:53.152 --> 02:14:55.325
Couldn't go on living there.

02:14:56.288 --> 02:15:00.293
Good thing the new preacher showed me
I had to go try somewhere else.

02:15:00.759 --> 02:15:03.797
He was the one told me
they was lookin' for deputies,

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:05.306
up in Bismuth.

02:15:06.732 --> 02:15:09.144
I made myself up a new life there.

02:15:11.770 --> 02:15:15.616
'Bout a year ago,
the sheriff there got himself shot,

02:15:15.741 --> 02:15:17.482
and I was chosen to replace him.

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:21.655
While I was cleaning out his office...

02:15:24.783 --> 02:15:26.626
I found this.

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:34.198
You should've changed your name, Liz.

02:15:35.494 --> 02:15:39.135
How many Elizabeth Brundys
you figure there are in this world?

02:15:39.264 --> 02:15:42.108
And how many of 'em
you figure don't got no tongue?

02:15:47.172 --> 02:15:50.449
Elizabeth Brundy,
I hereby arrest you

02:15:50.542 --> 02:15:52.488
for the murder of Frank Blain,

02:15:52.611 --> 02:15:56.787
your former employer
and proprietor of Frank's Inferno.

02:16:27.346 --> 02:16:29.849
Your past done caught up with you, Liz.

02:17:29.808 --> 02:17:31.754
<i>As life progresses,</i>

02:17:31.877 --> 02:17:33.652
<i>images blur.</i>

02:17:35.581 --> 02:17:38.061
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

02:17:47.092 --> 02:17:49.299
<i>I</i> remember her <i>well.</i>

02:17:51.096 --> 02:17:52.973
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

02:17:53.098 --> 02:17:55.100
<i>Always in control.</i>

02:18:16.688 --> 02:18:19.361
<i>We often wondered
what she was thinking about</i>

02:18:19.491 --> 02:18:21.129
<i>on her way down.</i>

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.507
<i>I like to think she thought of me.</i>

02:18:29.868 --> 02:18:33.611
<i>I like to think she knew
I would grow up to be strong.</i>

02:19:28.326 --> 02:19:30.204
<i>I remember her well.</i>

02:19:30.929 --> 02:19:32.737
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

02:19:36.401 --> 02:19:39.177
<i>It feels like she always
stayed with me.</i>

02:19:43.108 --> 02:19:44.519
<i>Watching over me.</i>

02:19:46.044 --> 02:19:48.388
Protecting me.

02:19:48.513 --> 02:19:50.754
Hey, come on. Put that down.

02:20:06.231 --> 02:20:07.608
- Mama?

02:20:08.267 --> 02:20:09.575
You coming?

02:28:20.892 --> 02:28:22.929
