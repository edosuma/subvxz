WEBVTT

00:12.680 --> 00:14.982
(sighs)

00:15.015 --> 00:16.684
Claire to Isaac.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.386
ISAAC:
Yes, Doctor.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.354
Can I borrow your brain
for a moment?

00:20.388 --> 00:23.091
I'm writing a paper
on the use of nanosynthesis

00:23.124 --> 00:24.825
in Xelayan tissue regeneration,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.660
and I could use your help
on the tech side.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.097
Of course, Doctor.
I am on my way.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.598
(door whooshes open)

00:32.400 --> 00:34.368
Dr. Finn.

00:34.402 --> 00:36.270
Hey, Bortus.
What can I do for you?

00:36.304 --> 00:38.372
I would like a mustache.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.007
I-I'm sorry?

00:40.040 --> 00:42.176
Lieutenant Malloy
has informed me

00:42.210 --> 00:43.777
that I would...

00:43.811 --> 00:46.080
"look pretty good
with a mustache."

00:46.114 --> 00:48.682
Moclans do not
grow facial hair naturally,

00:48.716 --> 00:50.251
so I require your help.

00:50.284 --> 00:52.120
Well, I-I mean,

00:52.153 --> 00:55.556
I could run a follicle
stimulator over your upper lip.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.691
-Please do so.
-Are you sure?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.027
The lieutenant
was quite persuasive.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.196
Okay, it's your face.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.232
(whirring)

01:06.066 --> 01:08.736
All set. You should have it
within the hour.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.771
Thank you, Doctor.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.075
CLAIRE:
Oh, Isaac. Good.

01:15.109 --> 01:16.610
Come here and take a look
at this.

01:16.644 --> 01:19.147
Is Commander Bortus unwell?

01:19.180 --> 01:22.150
The answer to that depends on
your taste in personal grooming.

01:22.183 --> 01:24.452
Why are you holding a banana?

01:24.485 --> 01:26.086
It is for you.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.722
I have noticed your tendency
to become cantankerous

01:28.756 --> 01:31.625
after 1600 hours
when you have not eaten.

01:31.659 --> 01:35.229
Well, thank you... I think.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.065
Now, this draft
is a little long,

01:38.098 --> 01:40.100
so I just need to verify
the sections pertaining

01:40.134 --> 01:42.270
to angiogenesis
in the vascular system.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.671
Have a read.

01:47.175 --> 01:49.443
-There are numerous errors.
-Mm, I thought so.

01:49.477 --> 01:52.246
Uh, would you be a pal
and take a pass at it?

01:52.280 --> 01:55.048
Of course, Doctor.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.286
-Revision complete.
-Thanks.

01:58.319 --> 01:59.653
I owe you one.

01:59.687 --> 02:01.088
One what?

02:01.121 --> 02:03.691
Uh, you know, return the favor?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.326
It is unlikely you would be able

02:05.359 --> 02:08.329
to offer useful insight
into any of my research.

02:08.362 --> 02:10.030
My intelligence
far exceeds your...

02:10.063 --> 02:13.133
Right, right, ri...
Uh, uh, I forgot. I'm sorry.

02:17.538 --> 02:20.441
You have modified
the configuration of your hair.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.610
A little bit, yeah.

02:22.643 --> 02:24.645
I didn't think
anyone would notice.

02:24.678 --> 02:27.848
Did the previous alignment
fail to provide adequate warmth?

02:27.881 --> 02:30.951
No, I just felt
like changing it.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.986
Odd.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.501
*

04:01.442 --> 04:03.944
Union Symphony's
here next week, right?

04:03.977 --> 04:05.946
They are, yeah. Ship arrives
on Friday. You going?

04:05.979 --> 04:07.615
Yeah, Cassius and I
were gonna go.

04:07.648 --> 04:10.284
-What about you?
-ED: I think so, yeah.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.591
Um... wow.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.762
Oh, my God.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.598
What is the matter?

04:24.632 --> 04:26.800
Nothing. We were all just
wondering when you decided

04:26.834 --> 04:28.168
to join the fire department.

04:28.201 --> 04:30.504
Hey! There you go.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.139
See, that's what
I'm talking about.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.608
-And now it makes sense.
-That was your idea?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.444
GORDON:
Yeah. He looks good, doesn't he?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.178
Rugged, authoritative.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.581
The lieutenant told me
it would be appealing.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.249
Is that not so?

04:42.282 --> 04:44.251
Oh, no,
it's-it's super appealing.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.286
-It really is. It's-it's great.
-I love it.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.856
I-I think people are really
gonna be talking about it.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.858
-Is that good?
-GORDON: Oh, totally.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.493
No, no, no,
they're-they're gonna be like,

04:52.526 --> 04:54.628
"Man, if he has that much
across the lip,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.797
I wonder
what else he's got going on."

04:56.830 --> 04:58.366
What does that even mean?

04:58.399 --> 05:02.636
Hey, um, you remember
that conversation we had

05:02.670 --> 05:04.638
about selectivity
with what you say to Bortus?

05:04.672 --> 05:06.607
Yeah.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.175
Oh. This would've been...

05:08.208 --> 05:09.343
This would've been
one of those things, yeah.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.711
CLAIRE:
Commander?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.513
I have that update
on the vaccine shipment

05:12.546 --> 05:13.714
to Alamak Three.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.516
Hand-delivered. Thanks, Claire.

05:15.549 --> 05:18.552
Actually, I came up here to
remind you guys about tonight.

05:18.586 --> 05:20.554
With all the buzz
about the symphony,

05:20.588 --> 05:24.124
I don't want you to forget Ty's
piano recital is this evening.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.726
I really hope
you all can make it.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.996
-Is it mandatory?
-Well, no, but...

05:29.029 --> 05:32.232
But we're all gonna go anyway,
because we want to support Ty.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.302
And Isaac, too.
He's been an amazing teacher.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.038
Ty possesses considerable
musical aptitude

05:38.071 --> 05:40.240
for a biological life-form.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.875
We'll be there.
Tell him good luck.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.176
I will.

05:43.210 --> 05:45.212
(piano playing)

06:04.231 --> 06:06.233
*

06:15.909 --> 06:17.344
He's really good.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.346
(whispers):
I know.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.949
Seriously, I thought
this was gonna suck,

06:21.982 --> 06:24.952
but he's really good.

06:33.326 --> 06:35.328
(cheering, whooping)

06:40.734 --> 06:42.736
KELLY:
I took piano lessons
when I was a kid

06:42.770 --> 06:44.772
'cause they told me
I had the hands for it.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.206
I quit after three lessons.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.941
Had the hands
but not the talent.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.977
This little guy, though.
You're something special,

06:50.010 --> 06:51.579
-you know that?
-Thanks.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.116
CLAIRE:
Oh. Excuse me a second.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.519
I haven't thanked the teacher.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.659
Hey, there. You standing
over here all alone?

07:05.693 --> 07:09.129
Large social gatherings provide
ample opportunity to observe

07:09.162 --> 07:11.965
the behavior
of biological life-forms.

07:11.999 --> 07:14.568
Is it always
just about studying us?

07:14.602 --> 07:16.436
That is my primary function.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.607
Does any small part of you
ever enjoy our company?

07:19.640 --> 07:23.143
Enjoyment is an emotional
response unique to biologicals.

07:23.176 --> 07:26.246
(scoffs)
Sit down. Have a drink with me.

07:26.279 --> 07:29.182
-I do not drink.
-Well, nobody's perfect.

07:33.721 --> 07:37.491
You know, Ty really loves
the time he spends with you.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.126
I know you can't
share the feeling,

07:39.159 --> 07:41.795
but he's really attached to you.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.430
The data I have acquired

07:43.463 --> 07:46.466
from his behavioral stimuli
has been plentiful.

07:46.500 --> 07:49.703
Is it possible that's the
machine equivalent of saying

07:49.737 --> 07:52.172
you like spending time
with him, too?

07:52.205 --> 07:56.309
Interesting. The parallel
would require further analysis.

07:56.343 --> 07:58.378
Well, you think about it,
then get back to me.

07:58.411 --> 08:01.481
The cognitive capacity
of most preadolescent humanoids

08:01.515 --> 08:03.116
is quite stunted.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.654
However, Ty has demonstrated
superior focus.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.722
There is a human phrase:

08:08.756 --> 08:11.759
"You should be
very proud of him."

08:24.872 --> 08:27.875
-(door chimes)
-Come in.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.978
Hey, Claire.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.647
-You have a minute?
-Sure, what's up?

08:33.681 --> 08:36.750
There's... something
I need to talk about,

08:36.784 --> 08:38.986
and I'm not sure
who else to go to.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.354
Well, you can always come to me.
What is it?

08:41.388 --> 08:43.490
You feel like a glass of wine?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.359
Always. But I don't do it
during work hours.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.229
Okay. Um...

08:51.464 --> 08:54.401
I think I'm developing feelings
for a member of the crew.

08:54.434 --> 08:57.571
And you're worried
whether it's appropriate.

08:57.605 --> 09:00.273
In several capacities, yeah.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.876
Your judgment is rock solid.
You'll know how to handle it.

09:02.910 --> 09:05.879
I can tell you that Cassius and
I have made it work pretty well,

09:05.913 --> 09:08.381
and there's obviously
all the history with me and Ed.

09:08.415 --> 09:10.383
Ship's still afloat.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.352
Can I ask who it is?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.755
It's Isaac.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.332
Chardonnay, two glasses.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.803
I know I sound
like a crazy person,

09:29.837 --> 09:33.106
but I think it's been brewing
since the shuttle crash.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.875
Have you talked to Isaac
about it?

09:34.908 --> 09:37.110
No. He has no idea.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.546
Claire, Isaac is incapable of...

09:39.579 --> 09:42.149
Incapable of love,
incapable of emotion, I know.

09:42.182 --> 09:44.918
He's a machine,
I understand that, but...

09:44.952 --> 09:47.454
(sighs)
when I'm with him,

09:47.487 --> 09:49.456
I don't know, I...

09:49.489 --> 09:53.093
We get along really well.
I feel warmth.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.262
Is it possible
that you're projecting

09:55.295 --> 09:57.665
that feeling yourself,
onto Isaac?

09:57.698 --> 10:02.069
Maybe. But hey,
don't we all do that?

10:02.102 --> 10:03.971
In every relationship?

10:04.004 --> 10:06.506
Especially when someone's
a little mysterious.

10:06.539 --> 10:09.843
I guess so. Whenever Ed was
silent for long stretches,

10:09.877 --> 10:12.145
I used to think he was pondering
big questions.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.048
Then he'd just be like,
"I'm hungry."

10:16.116 --> 10:17.317
He brought me a banana.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.119
-Ed?
-No, Isaac.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.855
Oh, right.

10:21.889 --> 10:24.091
Well, look,

10:24.124 --> 10:27.160
if it were Gordon or Yaphit
telling me this,

10:27.194 --> 10:29.162
I would probably see a red flag.

10:29.196 --> 10:32.032
But you are the most responsible
person I know.

10:32.065 --> 10:35.736
So if you're feeling this way,
then there's something there.

10:37.237 --> 10:41.842
Not to be indelicate,
but can he even...

10:41.875 --> 10:44.611
-I mean, does he have a...
-I-I haven't even thought
about that yet.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.447
I'm still just contending
with the emotional side of it.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.449
Well,

10:49.482 --> 10:51.685
I guess...

10:51.719 --> 10:53.186
why not?

10:53.220 --> 10:55.856
-Why not what?
-Why not try it?

10:55.889 --> 10:57.725
I mean, if it doesn't work out,
you could probably write

10:57.758 --> 10:59.392
an award-winning research paper.

10:59.426 --> 11:00.627
(chuckles)

11:00.660 --> 11:03.330
"The Secret Sordid
Love Lives of Robots."

11:03.363 --> 11:05.532
Not that it's a fair comparison,

11:05.565 --> 11:09.169
but as someone
who's been with a man

11:09.202 --> 11:11.905
who could be unemotional
at times,

11:11.939 --> 11:13.640
just be careful.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.308
We're all attached to Isaac,

11:15.342 --> 11:18.178
but the reality is
he can't love.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.048
Just make sure
you don't get hurt.

11:29.757 --> 11:31.558
Hi.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.593
Hello, Doctor.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.662
-What you doing?
-I am analyzing

11:35.695 --> 11:38.531
and reconforming
the hyperspace metrics

11:38.565 --> 11:41.001
in Dr. Aronov's
temporal equations.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.204
-Can I help at all?
-That is doubtful.

11:44.237 --> 11:47.540
-You want some company?
-For what purpose?

11:47.574 --> 11:50.710
Okay, um,
I'm just gonna go right at it.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.246
Uh, Isaac,

11:53.280 --> 11:55.515
would you like
to go on a date with me?

11:55.548 --> 11:58.018
-A date?
-Yes.

11:58.051 --> 12:01.254
A social coupling designed
to facilitate mating.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.791
Wow, it just got
really hot in here.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.859
I am not detecting a rise
in the temperature.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.294
Isaac.

12:07.327 --> 12:10.530
I would very much like
to go out with you.

12:10.563 --> 12:13.300
-Out? Into space?
-No.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.903
Out. To dinner, to a show.

12:15.936 --> 12:18.605
Uh, how about
the symphony on Friday?

12:18.638 --> 12:20.941
You and me-- we could see
how it feels.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.877
Such an outing
would yield substantial data

12:23.911 --> 12:26.146
regarding human
behavioral patterns.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.448
Is that a yes?

12:28.481 --> 12:29.950
Affirmative, Doctor.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.652
I will go on a date with you.

12:49.536 --> 12:53.473
I just think, if it had a little
more kick when I hit the gas,

12:53.506 --> 12:55.408
it would feel better, you know?

12:55.442 --> 12:57.744
You understand this isn't
a Porsche, right?

12:57.777 --> 13:00.680
This is a quantum drive engine
that makes a thousand trillion

13:00.713 --> 13:02.482
independent calculations
every millisecond.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.784
Yeah, I know that, I-I just
like to feel a certain level

13:04.818 --> 13:06.419
of responsiveness
when I'm driving.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.488
Oh, okay. You want
power steering, too?

13:08.521 --> 13:11.024
Maybe an air freshener
shaped like a little tree?

13:11.058 --> 13:12.625
ISAAC:
Excuse me, Commander Lamarr.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.194
Am I interrupting?

13:14.227 --> 13:15.695
Oh, hey, Isaac.
No. What's up?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.430
I require guidance.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.667
How does one prepare for a date?

13:20.700 --> 13:22.169
Uh, I'm sorry,

13:22.202 --> 13:24.037
-did you say "a date"?
-Affirmative.

13:24.071 --> 13:26.806
-Are you serious?
-Isaac, you have a date?

13:26.840 --> 13:28.675
-Yes.
-Oh, wow.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.377
Sweet emotion.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.012
I am seeking advice.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.481
Well, I mean,
what I would normally do is...

13:34.514 --> 13:36.649
I prefer to hear
from Commander Lamarr.

13:37.684 --> 13:39.552
Uh, well, who's the lucky lady?

13:39.586 --> 13:40.988
Or fella?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.722
Or o-object?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.024
Dr. Finn.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.626
-What? No way. Come on.
-JOHN: Wait,

13:46.659 --> 13:48.395
who asked who out?

13:48.428 --> 13:50.130
It was Dr. Finn's request.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.233
I must now learn the intricacies
of the ritual.

13:53.266 --> 13:55.135
Well, you got to
get some threads. I mean,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.304
if it's a real date, you're
gonna want to look snazzy.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.572
-Snazzy.
-But don't overdo it.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.841
It should feel comfortable
and feel like you.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.343
You're a pretty
conservative guy,

14:03.376 --> 14:05.812
so I would go
with something fun but classic.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.515
I have some really neat shirts
if you want to borrow one.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.983
I mean, not just for the date.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.651
Anytime.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.320
And you're gonna want
to pick her up at her place.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.988
And maybe bring
some flowers, too.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.158
But not roses. You don't want
to come on too strong too soon.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
This input is quite helpful.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.895
Thank you, Commander.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.437
(both panting)

14:30.470 --> 14:31.871
(grunting)

14:36.309 --> 14:38.011
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, my God, you guys.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.180
-Claire and Isaac
are going on a date.
-I swear to God.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.049
-This is so insane.
I can't even believe it!
-Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.416
Guys, guys, guys, slow down.
What's going on?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.717
All right.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.920
Claire asked Isaac
out on a date.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.621
-What?
-You serious?

14:48.655 --> 14:49.756
So he told you.

14:49.789 --> 14:51.258
Wait, you knew about this?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.792
Claire confided in me.

14:52.825 --> 14:54.427
But now, apparently,
the whole ship knows.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.930
Uh, is this a thing?
Like, wh-what did I miss?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.966
I mean, they've always been
close, right? I saw them

14:58.999 --> 15:00.567
hanging out together
after Ty's recital.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.735
They bonded during the shuttle
accident, and it just...

15:02.769 --> 15:05.272
blossomed into something more.
It happens.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.441
A human and an artificial
life-form are incompatible.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.077
It will not succeed.

15:10.110 --> 15:13.246
How do you know? They could just
be two people in love.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.082
Well, it's not
as simple as that.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.716
The guy has limitations.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.319
I mean, even in the best-case
scenario, he's still...

15:19.352 --> 15:21.288
my father, and he'll never be
a weight lifter

15:21.321 --> 15:23.456
no matter how much
his heart is in it.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.842
(door chimes)

15:51.818 --> 15:53.486
Hello, Doctor.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.788
I am here for our date.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.191
Isaac, you're-you're dressed.

15:58.225 --> 16:01.661
Commander Lamarr advised me
to look snazzy.

16:01.694 --> 16:03.663
Well, mission accomplished.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.365
I wish the boys could see you.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.434
-Will they be joining us?
-Uh, no.

16:07.467 --> 16:08.701
Ty's at a sleepover.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.937
Marcus went to the simulator.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.172
Shall we go?

16:12.205 --> 16:14.807
That is the next
appropriate step.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.324
You nervous?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.026
That is not possible.

16:33.060 --> 16:34.794
I am.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.463
Excited, but a little nervous.

16:36.496 --> 16:38.398
May I ask why?

16:38.431 --> 16:41.000
It's all brand-new, and I don't
know where it's gonna take me.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.170
That's always a little scary.

16:43.203 --> 16:44.971
-Perhaps you should go home.
-No.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.973
No, I mean, scary-good.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.642
Sometimes it's electrifying
being afraid.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.544
It means you're out
of your comfort zone.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.517
(door whooshes open)

17:02.222 --> 17:03.790
Shuttle bay.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.793
(instruments tuning)

17:16.603 --> 17:18.071
(audience murmuring)

17:20.273 --> 17:24.177
Bortus, I wish that you would
remove that thing.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.678
What thing?

17:25.712 --> 17:28.014
The strip of hair
above your lip.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.217
The mustache? Why?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.420
Because it is foolish-looking
and people are staring at us.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.956
They are not.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.926
And if they are,
it is with admiration.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.795
I do not like
the way it feels when we kiss.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.866
And last night, there were bits
of your dinner present.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.301
It must go.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.702
We will discuss this later.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.571
TOPA:
Papa?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.240
I like it.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.007
Thank you, Topa.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.780
(tuning dies down)

18:00.813 --> 18:03.283
(applause)

18:11.991 --> 18:13.726
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:13.760 --> 18:17.063
One of the great pleasures
of conducting the Union Symphony

18:17.096 --> 18:19.966
is getting to travel
around the galaxy every summer,

18:19.999 --> 18:23.002
performing for so many
brave members of the fleet.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.937
It's an honor to be here.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.240
Before we begin
our main program,

18:27.274 --> 18:29.442
we'd like to start off
with something a little light.

18:29.476 --> 18:31.344
Enjoy.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.282
(sweeping, symphonic overtures)

19:01.708 --> 19:03.743
(orchestra playing
"Singin' in the Rain")

19:17.524 --> 19:19.926
*

19:35.942 --> 19:38.445
*

19:44.751 --> 19:47.153
You know, it was funny
they played that song.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.556
Just the other day,
I was thinking what I miss most

19:49.589 --> 19:52.425
about being away from Earth:
the rain.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.927
It is my understanding
that many humans

19:54.961 --> 19:56.429
dislike precipitation.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.164
Oh, not this human.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.200
When I was on Earth,
I used to sit outside

20:01.234 --> 20:03.436
on the front porch
before a thunderstorm

20:03.470 --> 20:05.538
and smell the ozone in the air.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.674
And then the rain
would come crashing down

20:07.707 --> 20:10.543
in big, dark curtains,
and it was exciting

20:10.577 --> 20:13.380
and beautiful and humbling
and wonderful.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.282
And I always thought to myself,

20:15.315 --> 20:18.184
"This is what being alive
is all about."

20:18.217 --> 20:20.186
The simulator is quite capable

20:20.219 --> 20:22.121
of recreating
such an environment.

20:22.154 --> 20:24.357
It's not the same.
I tried.

20:24.391 --> 20:27.760
The smells are never
completely accurate.

20:27.794 --> 20:31.063
Although, I must say,
I am really impressed

20:31.097 --> 20:32.799
with this simulation.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.201
It is your favorite
Earth restaurant, is it not?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.403
Yeah.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.137
I was wondering how you knew.

20:38.170 --> 20:39.972
It was in your personnel file.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.642
My neural processors
can instantly access

20:42.675 --> 20:44.544
and cross-reference
all information

20:44.577 --> 20:46.546
-in the ship's database.
-Wow.

20:46.579 --> 20:48.381
Feels like home.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.383
Your home is
Baltimore, Maryland.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.219
Located in the Northwestern
Hemisphere of Earth.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.221
Founded 1729, Earth time.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.256
Approximately 210
square kilometers...

20:57.290 --> 21:00.159
O-Okay, you got it. You got it.
Ooh, my God.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.329
You're like Jeff Bellman.

21:02.362 --> 21:05.097
A fictional character from
your favorite motion picture,

21:05.131 --> 21:08.401
Mind of Hermes,
completed 2035 Earth time.

21:08.435 --> 21:09.936
-A depiction of...
-I-Isaac.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.238
Is there anything
you don't know about me?

21:12.271 --> 21:15.908
I downloaded all available
information prior to our date.

21:15.942 --> 21:17.477
It kind of takes the fun out

21:17.510 --> 21:19.178
of getting to know someone,
doesn't it?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.247
My intent was
to maximize efficiency

21:21.280 --> 21:24.317
so that our evening
would conclude more promptly.

21:24.351 --> 21:26.753
What's my favorite
vacation spot?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.488
The Caribbean island
of Saint Lucia.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.989
-Favorite animal.
-The dolphin.

21:30.022 --> 21:31.157
-Favorite drink.
-Champagne.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.959
-Favorite food.
-Potato cakes.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.761
Here's your potato cakes
and champagne.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.195
Thank you.

21:37.897 --> 21:39.366
Isaac.

21:39.399 --> 21:41.968
It's not really a first date
without the excitement

21:42.001 --> 21:43.836
of getting to know
the other person.

21:43.870 --> 21:45.705
My method is more efficient.

21:45.738 --> 21:47.840
Uh, yeah,
but nothing's spontaneous.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.308
Okay, listen.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.944
Let's flip the tables here.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.112
(simulated patrons gasp)

21:53.145 --> 21:55.682
That's not what I meant.

21:55.715 --> 21:58.951
Reset table.

21:58.985 --> 22:03.189
What I mean is,
why don't I ask about you?

22:03.222 --> 22:04.657
Of course, Doctor.

22:04.691 --> 22:08.561
No human has ever been
to your home planet Kaylon.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.029
What's it like?

22:10.062 --> 22:12.499
Kaylon 1.
It is a planet populated

22:12.532 --> 22:14.200
by artificial life-forms.

22:14.233 --> 22:17.837
Circumference,
57,583 kilometers.

22:17.870 --> 22:21.674
Average density,
4.42 grams per cubic centimeter.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.844
Surface gravity,
1.13 times Earth standard.

22:24.877 --> 22:26.913
And these reports
you send about us--

22:26.946 --> 22:28.981
the data you collect
for your research

22:29.015 --> 22:32.385
of biological life-forms--
how long does it go on?

22:32.419 --> 22:34.220
Kaylon Primary will notify me

22:34.253 --> 22:36.322
when sufficient data
has been acquired.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.692
And then your people will
consider joining the Union?

22:39.726 --> 22:40.893
That is correct.

22:42.261 --> 22:44.531
What does your data
tell you about us?

22:44.564 --> 22:46.265
Please clarify.

22:46.298 --> 22:50.236
Well, what I mean is, I was...

22:50.269 --> 22:52.238
Well, I was ju...

22:56.609 --> 22:58.144
Never mind.

23:03.249 --> 23:06.619
Well, I had a really
interesting time tonight, Isaac.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.187
As did I.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.022
It yielded considerable data.

23:10.056 --> 23:12.592
Of which I have
already begun analysis.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.727
At least you'll be
thinking about me.

23:14.761 --> 23:17.263
Do you wish
to have another date?

23:17.296 --> 23:19.298
Um, uh, m-maybe.

23:19.331 --> 23:20.767
Shall we begin now?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.735
Uh, l-let's give it
a day or so, huh?

23:22.769 --> 23:24.136
I am a little tired.

23:24.170 --> 23:25.472
Very well.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.206
Good night, Doctor.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.941
Good night, Isaac.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.254
*

24:15.622 --> 24:17.590
Well?

24:17.624 --> 24:20.159
Can I assist you, Lieutenant?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.861
Don't act like you don't know
what I'm talking about.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.329
How did it go?

24:23.362 --> 24:25.765
You are referring to my evening
with Dr. Finn.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.868
Yes, brainiac. We're all dying
to find out what happened.

24:28.901 --> 24:30.436
We attended the symphony,

24:30.469 --> 24:32.972
then Dr. Finn consumed
an evening meal.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.341
That's it?
That's all you're gonna tell us?

24:35.374 --> 24:36.976
What information do you require?

24:37.009 --> 24:40.112
-Did you have fun?
Were there sparks?
-Sparks?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.447
-Yeah.
-Negative.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.550
There was no
equipment malfunction.

24:43.583 --> 24:45.317
Well, you don't have
to brag about it.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.153
There is one element
that has presented

24:47.186 --> 24:49.989
some difficulty in my analysis.

24:50.022 --> 24:53.325
Dr. Finn said I was not
"spontaneous" enough.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.795
Sounds like she wants you
to be more in the moment.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.196
Please elaborate.

24:57.229 --> 24:59.365
Well, you should try to
surprise her every now and then.

24:59.398 --> 25:01.033
One year, for my birthday,
Ed showed up

25:01.067 --> 25:02.501
in my office unannounced,
and he brought me a cake.

25:02.535 --> 25:04.003
-Baked it myself.
-It was the saddest,

25:04.036 --> 25:06.005
grossest-looking thing
you've ever seen.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.674
-Okay, but that's not...
-It was like a wide mound
of yellow.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.341
-It was the taste that matters.
-It looked like...

25:09.375 --> 25:11.644
You ever see a picture
of a caterpillar pupa?

25:11.678 --> 25:13.546
-Come on, now. That's... No...
-Like a half-formed thing?

25:13.580 --> 25:15.347
-That's what it looked like.
-That's what
it looked like, but...

25:15.381 --> 25:16.849
But it was
the thought that counted.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.885
But it was the thought
that counted. Exactly.

25:30.863 --> 25:33.432
Well, you couldn't
be healthier, Talla.

25:33.465 --> 25:35.234
Every test is letter perfect.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.436
-Told you.
-Yeah, well,

25:37.469 --> 25:39.772
it's still no excuse for waiting
so long for your physical.

25:39.806 --> 25:42.374
Most ships' doctors
aren't as patient as I am.

25:42.408 --> 25:43.776
Excuse the pun.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.746
-Hey.
-Oh, Commander, hi.

25:46.779 --> 25:48.581
Forget the commander.
This is a Kelly visit.

25:48.615 --> 25:50.016
We heard Isaac's bone-dry
account, and I wanted

25:50.049 --> 25:52.118
-to hear how your night went.
-Ugh.

25:52.151 --> 25:54.253
-I just don't know.
-What do you mean?

25:54.286 --> 25:58.224
I just... didn't feel the way
I wanted to feel.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.227
It's like, when I'm just
spending time with Isaac

26:01.260 --> 26:04.563
under normal circumstances,
he's charming and adorable

26:04.597 --> 26:05.798
without even trying.

26:05.832 --> 26:08.735
But last night,
he was so prepared.

26:08.768 --> 26:12.238
-It was all too rigid.
-Well, he is a machine.

26:12.271 --> 26:14.473
I know.
And dating a machine, it's...

26:14.506 --> 26:17.376
Oh, God, I hear my mother's
words in my head:

26:17.409 --> 26:20.713
"Be open-minded, but not so open
that your brain falls out."

26:20.747 --> 26:24.483
You know, there is one upside
here: he doesn't eat.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.118
Well, how is that an upside?

26:26.152 --> 26:28.054
Every time I'm in
a relationship, I gain weight.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.822
-It's just all about food.
-That's true.

26:29.856 --> 26:32.258
Like, 90% of a relationship
is going, "What should we eat?"

26:32.291 --> 26:33.893
You go out, you eat, you drink,

26:33.926 --> 26:35.995
you come home,
you eat more, you drink more.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.297
Ed and I gained 40 pounds
combined when we were married.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.499
That's why I always try
to break up with guys by summer.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.601
-God, we were fat.
-See, you don't have
to worry about that.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.003
Point for Isaac.

26:44.036 --> 26:46.639
Great. We can be awkward
and starving.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.275
I-I don't know, Kelly,
maybe you were right.

26:49.308 --> 26:52.444
Maybe it was just me projecting
my own affection onto him

26:52.478 --> 26:54.446
and thinking it was real.

26:54.480 --> 26:55.848
So what are you gonna do?

26:55.882 --> 26:58.384
(sighs)

27:16.068 --> 27:18.337
I have brought you a cake.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.006
Isaac, what the hell
are you doing here?

27:20.039 --> 27:21.674
I am being spontaneous.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.776
It's 3:00 in the morning.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.445
Surprise.
I am taking you on a date.

27:26.478 --> 27:29.348
No, Isaac.
For God's sake, not now.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.150
-Mom, what's going on?
-God...

27:31.183 --> 27:32.819
-Hey, Isaac.
-Hello, Ty.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.620
-Why is Isaac here?
-CLAIRE: Never mind, kids.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.789
-Go back to bed now.
-Is that cake for us?

27:36.823 --> 27:39.959
Now, Ty. We'll talk
in the morning. Go.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.294
Listen, Isaac, this is my fault.

27:42.328 --> 27:44.897
I don't know why I ever thought
this was going to work.

27:44.931 --> 27:48.667
I was lonely, and I just reached
out in the wrong direction.

27:48.701 --> 27:50.302
On the contrary.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.972
The data I have accumulated
has been most useful.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.574
You see,
that's exactly what I mean.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.576
To you, it's just data.

27:57.609 --> 28:01.147
Uh, my God,
I can't even kiss you.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.514
Does this mean you do not wish

28:02.548 --> 28:04.316
to go on a date
with me right now?

28:04.350 --> 28:07.519
Yes, that is what it means.
I'm sorry.

28:07.553 --> 28:11.557
I think we should just go back
to the way things were.

28:11.590 --> 28:13.960
Very well.
Good night, Doctor.

28:17.129 --> 28:19.131
("Centerfold"
by The J. Geils Band playing)

28:22.869 --> 28:24.436
JOHN:
Uh-huh, yes.

28:24.470 --> 28:26.773
That's a good ball.

28:26.806 --> 28:28.674
-TURCO: Yeah, baby! Whoo!
-Boom!

28:28.707 --> 28:30.509
-That's what I'm talking about!
-(grunting)

28:30.542 --> 28:32.078
It's true,
he was just talking about that.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.714
GORDON:
Hey, Isaac.

28:35.748 --> 28:36.715
What's going on?

28:36.749 --> 28:38.417
I am here to observe.

28:38.450 --> 28:40.887
-You want to learn how to bowl?
-Negative.

28:40.920 --> 28:45.391
It is my understanding that you
and Ensign Turco are dating.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.360
I mean, we... yeah,
it's not serious or anything,

28:48.394 --> 28:49.762
-but we hang out.
-It's not?

28:49.796 --> 28:51.363
-Is it?
-I... uh, no.

28:51.397 --> 28:52.865
-TURCO: No, right?
-JOHN: Uh, no.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.700
-No.
-Psh. Why do you ask?

28:54.733 --> 28:56.969
Dr. Finn has terminated
our coupling.

28:57.003 --> 29:00.739
This would indicate a flaw
in my ability to fully process

29:00.773 --> 29:02.641
human romantic interaction.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.210
Wait. Claire broke up with you?

29:04.243 --> 29:06.045
-Affirmative.
-TURCO: Oh, my God, Isaac,

29:06.078 --> 29:07.379
I'm so sorry.

29:07.413 --> 29:08.915
You are not to blame, Ensign.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.616
What did she say, exactly?

29:10.649 --> 29:13.585
CLAIRE (over Isaac):
Listen, Isaac,
this is my fault.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.122
I don't know why I ever thought
this was going to work.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.556
I was lonely,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.591
and I just reached out
in the wrong direction.

29:19.625 --> 29:23.295
My God, I can't even kiss you.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.697
Okay, remind me never
to tell you anything intimate.

29:26.799 --> 29:29.201
I think I might have an idea.

29:48.120 --> 29:50.122
*

30:04.403 --> 30:05.838
Hello, Doctor.

30:05.872 --> 30:09.275
Isaac.
What... what are you doing?

30:09.308 --> 30:11.210
Initiate simulation.

30:43.342 --> 30:45.311
Isaac.

30:45.344 --> 30:48.080
Is that you?

30:48.114 --> 30:50.082
Affirmative, Doctor.

30:50.116 --> 30:53.085
Commander Lamarr suggested
I create a simulation

30:53.119 --> 30:55.888
that would allow us to kiss.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.328
(quietly):
Can't believe it.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.597
In addition, I have deleted
all data pertaining

31:05.631 --> 31:09.401
to your background and interests
from my internal memory.

31:09.435 --> 31:12.438
This will allow me
to get to know you.

31:14.907 --> 31:16.608
Would you like to sit?

31:17.876 --> 31:20.446
I think I better.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.552
So I guess this means
you don't know where I'm from.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.588
Negative. That information
has been deleted.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.191
Baltimore, Maryland.
Back on Earth.

31:32.224 --> 31:35.461
I would like to know more
about Baltimore.

31:35.494 --> 31:38.931
(chuckles) That's a sentence
you don't hear very often.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.367
Um, well, I haven't been
back in a while,

31:41.400 --> 31:43.802
but I remember
there was always something

31:43.835 --> 31:46.705
to see and do.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.907
Music, art, live performances.

31:48.941 --> 31:51.877
They have one of the best
symphonies on the continent.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.612
Do you prefer it to the Orville?

31:53.645 --> 31:55.814
Oh, no, I love my job,

31:55.847 --> 31:58.817
-but I do miss one thing.
-What is it?

31:58.850 --> 32:01.587
You really did
delete everything.

32:01.620 --> 32:05.091
Rain, Isaac.
I miss the rain.

32:05.124 --> 32:09.395
It is my understanding that many
humans dislike precipitation.

32:09.428 --> 32:12.231
(laughs):
Déjà vu. I love it.

32:12.264 --> 32:16.702
I would be interested
to see Baltimore.

32:37.123 --> 32:39.525
Was that a kiss?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.660
It was.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.830
Did I execute it correctly?

32:44.863 --> 32:47.333
You did just fine, Isaac.

32:47.366 --> 32:51.503
If you wish,
you may kiss me again.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.610
Simulate quarters.

32:58.644 --> 33:01.547
Finn, Dr. Claire J.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.552
I'd like to do more than that.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.584
*

33:53.099 --> 33:55.067
The moment he transformed,

33:55.101 --> 33:59.037
it was one of the most moving
experiences I've ever had.

33:59.071 --> 34:02.341
A machine who knows nothing
of love--

34:02.374 --> 34:04.009
only logic--

34:04.042 --> 34:07.879
figured out a way to say,
"I'm trying. Let me try."

34:07.913 --> 34:09.948
-How was he?
-At first,

34:09.981 --> 34:12.384
I thought it was
gonna feel mathematical,

34:12.418 --> 34:16.388
but that was
the exquisite part of it.

34:16.422 --> 34:19.024
He could instantly attune to

34:19.057 --> 34:22.928
and harmonize with my every
move, with such precision.

34:22.961 --> 34:26.898
Imagine a human guy that aware,
that eager to please.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.900
-It was amazing.
-I got to say,

34:28.934 --> 34:30.569
that actually sounds
kind of incredible.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.771
It sounds like
he really is a machine.

34:32.804 --> 34:34.440
But does that really matter?

34:34.473 --> 34:37.476
Does it matter why people
do what they do for us,

34:37.509 --> 34:40.379
whether it's a man
or a computer?

34:40.412 --> 34:41.980
As long as they
make you feel the way

34:42.013 --> 34:43.649
you want to feel,
then I don't think so.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.884
It's the best
it's ever been for me.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.453
And maybe it's okay

34:47.486 --> 34:49.488
that it doesn't look
like I thought it would.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.923
Maybe it's okay
that it looks like

34:51.957 --> 34:53.559
a woman and a vacuum cleaner.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.361
(laughs)

34:56.628 --> 34:58.897
I think I'm in love with him.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.732
The coital pairing
marks the completion

35:00.766 --> 35:02.401
of my data acquisition.

35:02.434 --> 35:05.737
What is the proper method
of terminating a coupling?

35:05.771 --> 35:07.306
You want to break up with her?

35:07.339 --> 35:10.342
There is no need for further
association at this time.

35:10.376 --> 35:14.012
Analysis of the data I have
accumulated will be sufficient.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.282
Well, she's probably
gonna be really upset.

35:16.315 --> 35:19.084
It is not my intention
to distress Dr. Finn.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.953
I merely wish to conclude
the experiment.

35:21.987 --> 35:24.290
(sighs)
I can tell you what I do.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.325
When I'm in it with a girl
and I want out

35:26.358 --> 35:28.294
but I don't want
to make her feel bad,

35:28.327 --> 35:31.530
-I get her to break up with me.
-Please elaborate.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.965
You just have to make yourself
really unappealing

35:33.999 --> 35:36.001
so she doesn't want to be
with you anymore.

35:36.034 --> 35:38.304
That way, you end it,
but nobody gets hurt.

35:38.337 --> 35:40.839
-At least, not as much.
-I see.

35:40.872 --> 35:44.510
How would you suggest
I proceed in this endeavor?

35:44.543 --> 35:46.912
(sighs)

35:54.553 --> 35:57.523
Ah, you are home.
It is about time.

35:57.556 --> 35:59.625
Isaac, what are you doing?

35:59.658 --> 36:01.126
I am awaiting my dinner.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.662
This has caused me
to become displeased.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.130
CLAIRE:
You don't eat.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.798
And what the hell
are you wearing?

36:06.832 --> 36:09.134
-Is that underwear?
-Affirmative.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.902
I thought we were
going out tonight.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.639
I was looking forward to trying
that butter cake at Mooska's.

36:13.672 --> 36:15.807
The last thing you need
is more dessert.

36:15.841 --> 36:17.075
Excuse me?

36:17.108 --> 36:18.710
As I am incapable of stuttering,

36:18.744 --> 36:20.512
I must conclude
that you heard me.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.014
Okay, you're gonna
tell me what's going on

36:23.048 --> 36:24.983
right now,
beginning with an apology

36:25.016 --> 36:26.184
for what you just said.

36:26.218 --> 36:28.053
I am sorry you are upset.

36:28.086 --> 36:29.855
Perhaps you are on your period.

36:29.888 --> 36:32.258
Get out. Right now.

36:32.291 --> 36:37.195
Does this mean we are
no longer together?

36:37.229 --> 36:39.598
Wait a minute.

36:39.631 --> 36:41.867
Is that what you're
trying to do--

36:41.900 --> 36:43.402
get me to break up with you?

36:43.435 --> 36:46.405
-Affirmative, Doctor.
-Why?

36:46.438 --> 36:49.375
Commander Lamarr said it would
be the most appropriate means

36:49.408 --> 36:51.176
of terminating our coupling.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.245
But why would you want
to do that?

36:53.279 --> 36:56.782
I have experienced the full arc
of a human relationship.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.752
Our sexual union signified the
completion of the experience.

37:00.786 --> 37:04.356
You slept with me,
so now you're finished with me?

37:04.390 --> 37:05.891
That is correct.

37:08.594 --> 37:12.731
Fine, then.
You just got what you wanted.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.666
We're done.

37:16.134 --> 37:19.037
Get out.

37:19.070 --> 37:22.073
Good day, Doctor.
Thank you for your assistance.

37:45.431 --> 37:48.567
Captain, I have completed
the spectrographic analysis

37:48.600 --> 37:50.302
of the Septar binary system.

37:50.336 --> 37:52.237
Full data cataloging variations

37:52.270 --> 37:54.406
in radial velocity
is now available.

37:54.440 --> 37:56.808
-Great. Coordinate
with Chief Lamarr.
-Aye, sir.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.479
Way to go, jerk.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.616
-Are you addressing me,
Lieutenant?
-Nope.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.452
No, just talking to myself.

38:06.485 --> 38:08.454
How's Claire doing, Commander?

38:08.487 --> 38:11.523
-She's doing great, considering.
-That's good.

38:11.557 --> 38:13.525
I know if a guy
ever treated me that way,

38:13.559 --> 38:15.160
I'd probably want to break
a few of his ribs.

38:15.193 --> 38:17.195
Understandable feeling.

38:17.228 --> 38:19.431
It's weird how some guys
can treat a woman that way

38:19.465 --> 38:21.767
and somehow just...
not be bothered by it.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.369
Takes a special kind

38:23.402 --> 38:25.337
of garbage person,
if you ask me.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.315
(indistinct conversations)

38:39.317 --> 38:40.686
Another one, miss?

38:40.719 --> 38:43.555
Yeah, thanks. Make it a double.

38:46.925 --> 38:48.860
YAPHIT:
Hey, Doc.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.896
Oh, God, not here.

38:50.929 --> 38:53.499
Yaphit, this is
a private simulation.

38:53.532 --> 38:55.200
I thought you might
want some company.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.335
(groans)

38:59.505 --> 39:02.173
What in God's name did you do?

39:02.207 --> 39:04.576
-Just a little makeover.
Can I buy you a drink?
-No.

39:04.610 --> 39:06.512
Are you sure?
I know I hate being alone

39:06.545 --> 39:08.079
when I'm on the rebound.

39:08.113 --> 39:11.249
-I'm not on the rebound.
-Hey, man, I'm on your side.

39:11.282 --> 39:12.884
I always knew Isaac
was a scumbag.

39:12.918 --> 39:14.820
Only had one thing
on his mind, that guy.

39:14.853 --> 39:16.354
You're better off without him.

39:16.388 --> 39:19.024
Yeah, I just wish someone
had told me that before.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.358
Hey, you want to see
something cool?

39:20.392 --> 39:22.360
-What?
-Watch this.

39:24.029 --> 39:26.364
Some whiskey, milady?

39:27.599 --> 39:29.034
God.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.571
What did I say?

39:44.550 --> 39:47.052
-Hello, Doctor.
-What do you want?

39:47.085 --> 39:49.220
I am here for Ty's piano lesson.

39:49.254 --> 39:51.222
Ty has a new piano teacher.

39:51.256 --> 39:54.059
-May I ask whom?
-Lieutenant Kleeman.

39:54.092 --> 39:57.963
Lieutenant Kleeman's 26 fingers
may appear to be an advantage.

39:57.996 --> 40:00.298
However, his ability
to navigate the keyboard

40:00.331 --> 40:01.900
is inferior to mine.

40:01.933 --> 40:03.702
He'll manage just fine.

40:03.735 --> 40:07.038
-Your reasoning is unclear.
-Then let me clarify it for you.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.808
You and I have to work together,
but aside from that,

40:09.841 --> 40:12.043
I don't want you in my life.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.379
If this is due to the
termination of our coupling,

40:14.412 --> 40:18.116
it would be far more efficient
to excise it from your memory

40:18.149 --> 40:20.085
and resume standard
operating status.

40:20.118 --> 40:21.887
Yeah, well, it doesn't work
that way for humans.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.221
I know you can't
understand that,

40:23.254 --> 40:24.656
and that's why I don't hate you.

40:24.690 --> 40:26.658
I just don't want
to be around you

40:26.692 --> 40:28.827
any more than I have to.
That's all.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.196
Very well, Doct...

40:53.318 --> 40:55.654
There's a sight
you don't see every day.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.355
I've heard about these things,

40:57.388 --> 40:58.990
but I've never been
this close to one.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.458
Isaac, analysis.

41:00.492 --> 41:03.361
The primary is a type B7
white dwarf star.

41:03.394 --> 41:06.331
The secondary
is a type M2 red dwarf.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.999
The radial velocity
of the white dwarf

41:08.033 --> 41:10.836
is 78.2 kilometers per second.

41:10.869 --> 41:12.437
Correction:

41:12.470 --> 41:14.840
89.6 kilometers per second.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.875
Wait, wait, wait,
how's that possible?

41:16.908 --> 41:19.511
Orbital velocity can't just
change without an outside force.

41:19.545 --> 41:20.946
It did not, sir.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.348
The error was mine.

41:23.381 --> 41:26.317
-Yours?
-ISAAC: Yes, Commander.

41:26.351 --> 41:29.454
I believe I should perform
a self-diagnostic immediately.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.023
I'd say that's a good idea.

41:37.162 --> 41:39.965
I've never seen him
make a mistake before.

41:39.998 --> 41:41.399
At least, not that kind.

41:53.945 --> 41:55.547
(door whooshes open)

41:56.782 --> 41:58.817
Am I interrupting?

41:58.850 --> 42:03.221
Negative, sir. I have completed
97% of the diagnostic.

42:03.254 --> 42:05.824
-You find anything?
-There is no evidence

42:05.857 --> 42:07.993
of any significant malfunction.

42:08.026 --> 42:09.995
However, I believe
I have identified

42:10.028 --> 42:11.730
the source of the error.

42:11.763 --> 42:12.898
And what is it?

42:12.931 --> 42:14.099
I have restructured

42:14.132 --> 42:15.834
several recursive algorithms

42:15.867 --> 42:18.003
in order to accommodate
Dr. Finn's request

42:18.036 --> 42:20.171
that we minimize
our association.

42:20.205 --> 42:23.508
However, I neglected to account
for the adaptive nature

42:23.541 --> 42:25.343
of my programming at large.

42:25.376 --> 42:28.513
Well, we've all done that once
or twice. So what happened?

42:28.546 --> 42:30.916
The time I have spent
with Dr. Finn

42:30.949 --> 42:32.517
since my arrival
on board the Orville

42:32.550 --> 42:35.386
has affected a number
of unrelated subprograms.

42:35.420 --> 42:38.556
The data had not reduced the
efficiency of those subroutines,

42:38.590 --> 42:40.759
so I saw no reason to delete it.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.694
However, it has contradicted
the directive

42:42.728 --> 42:44.730
of the new algorithms.

42:44.763 --> 42:46.698
She's gotten under your skin.

42:46.732 --> 42:49.768
-I do not have skin.
-Your various programs

42:49.801 --> 42:52.537
are used to her,
and it turns out

42:52.570 --> 42:55.240
she's not so easy
to just... delete.

42:55.273 --> 42:58.944
A crude analogy,
but essentially accurate.

42:58.977 --> 43:00.411
You know, Isaac,
you just might be

43:00.445 --> 43:02.413
the first artificial
life-form in history

43:02.447 --> 43:05.250
-to fall in love.
-That is not possible.

43:05.283 --> 43:06.818
However, the incompatible data

43:06.852 --> 43:09.387
must be consolidated
in some fashion.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.823
I must create
a new translative program.

43:11.857 --> 43:15.961
Let me suggest
a possible option.

43:15.994 --> 43:18.596
There is one part
of the relationship experience

43:18.630 --> 43:20.666
that you haven't yet tackled.

43:20.699 --> 43:22.167
Please elaborate.

43:22.200 --> 43:23.568
You screwed up,

43:23.601 --> 43:25.503
and now you have
to win back the girl.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.973
Dr. Finn has made
her wishes clear.

43:28.006 --> 43:29.941
Yeah, well, Dr. Finn
is also the wisest person

43:29.975 --> 43:32.443
on board this ship. She knows
how new this is to you.

43:32.477 --> 43:34.646
If she sees you making
a real effort,

43:34.680 --> 43:37.582
then who knows?
She just might be understanding.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.085
I have no experience
in such matters.

43:40.118 --> 43:41.753
Yeah, well, there's no rule book
for this one.

43:41.787 --> 43:44.856
Y-You just have to take
everything you know about her,

43:44.890 --> 43:49.360
every bit of data, and do
something you've never done.

43:49.394 --> 43:52.330
-What is that?
-Be creative.

43:57.836 --> 44:00.205
(door whooshes open)

44:07.846 --> 44:10.982
You finally shaved, huh?

44:11.016 --> 44:15.854
Klyden insisted.
I became tired of his protests.

44:15.887 --> 44:18.489
Well, for what it's worth, I
think you look better this way.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.158
Perhaps.

44:20.191 --> 44:23.661
It was... itchy.

44:23.695 --> 44:25.797
Well, I think we've seen
about all there is to see here.

44:25.831 --> 44:27.365
Affirmative on that.
We got about

44:27.398 --> 44:29.300
six months' worth of data
out of these scans.

44:29.334 --> 44:31.402
Gordon, set a course
for outpost 30.

44:31.436 --> 44:33.538
You got it, sir.
Off we go.

44:40.411 --> 44:42.714
Lieutenant Keyali,
signal them we're on our way.

44:42.748 --> 44:43.949
Aye, Commander.

44:45.216 --> 44:46.651
What is it, Captain?

44:46.684 --> 44:48.820
Hmm?

44:48.854 --> 44:50.822
I got a message,
you needed me on the bridge?

44:50.856 --> 44:53.591
-I-I didn't call you.
-You didn't?

44:53.624 --> 44:55.761
-Did you call sickbay?
-No.

44:55.794 --> 44:57.562
CLAIRE:
Well, somebody did.

44:57.595 --> 44:59.564
My comm said it came
from the bridge.

44:59.597 --> 45:00.966
I did, Doctor.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.235
What for?

45:07.739 --> 45:11.176
GENE KELLY:
* I'm singin' in the rain *

45:11.209 --> 45:14.412
* Just singin' in the rain *

45:14.445 --> 45:17.382
* What a glorious feeling *

45:17.415 --> 45:19.017
* I'm happy again... *

45:19.050 --> 45:23.121
Initiate environmental
subprogram 43-Isaac.

45:23.154 --> 45:24.522
* I'm laughin' at clouds *

45:24.555 --> 45:28.426
* So dark up above *

45:28.459 --> 45:31.196
* The sun's in my heart *

45:31.229 --> 45:34.265
* And I'm ready for love *

45:34.299 --> 45:36.968
* Let the stormy clouds
chase... *

45:37.002 --> 45:39.104
ISAAC:
Dr. Finn.

45:39.137 --> 45:41.272
I apologize for my conduct.

45:41.306 --> 45:44.709
Further analysis of human
interaction has informed me

45:44.742 --> 45:47.478
that a relationship
is best served when both parties

45:47.512 --> 45:49.815
make a commitment
to its longevity.

45:49.848 --> 45:51.649
I wish to attempt this.

45:51.682 --> 45:56.054
Isaac, if a relationship
has any chance of working,

45:56.087 --> 45:58.489
it has to matter to both people

45:58.523 --> 46:00.758
more than anything else
in their lives.

46:00.792 --> 46:03.494
My research has verified
this fact.

46:03.528 --> 46:06.397
And why should I just say yes?

46:06.431 --> 46:09.100
My internal programs
will function more efficiently

46:09.134 --> 46:10.335
if you do.

46:11.769 --> 46:14.439
You're saying...

46:14.472 --> 46:17.308
you're better with me
than without me?

46:17.342 --> 46:19.310
Affirmative, Doctor.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.968
We are, without a doubt,

46:43.001 --> 46:46.171
the weirdest ship in the fleet.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.486
*

47:18.569 --> 47:23.141
* I'm dancin' and singin' *

47:23.174 --> 47:26.945
* In the rain. *

48:21.967 --> 48:23.935
