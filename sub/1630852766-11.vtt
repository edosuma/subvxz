<i> In the early 2000s,</i>

00:09.477 --> 00:10.976
<i> "girls next door" was one</i>

00:11.078 --> 00:13.912
<i> of the most popular</i>
<i> reality shows on tv.</i>

00:14.015 --> 00:17.016
<i> We all fell in love with</i>
<i> those blonde girls next door,</i>

00:17.118 --> 00:19.251
<i> and we also fell in love</i>
<i> with hugh hefner.</i>

00:19.353 --> 00:22.388
<i> That world seemed</i>
<i> fun and innocent,</i>

00:22.490 --> 00:24.990
<i> and the girls were</i>
<i> pretty fun to watch.</i>

00:25.092 --> 00:27.593
<i>In the final season of the show,</i>
<i> two twins,</i>

00:27.695 --> 00:31.530
<i> karissa and kristina shannon,</i>
<i>played two of hef's girlfriends.</i>

00:31.632 --> 00:34.299
-Hi. I'm kristina.
-I'm karissa.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.901
<i>After the "secrets of playboy,"</i>

00:36.003 --> 00:37.669
<i> they decided</i>
<i> to finally come forward</i>

00:37.772 --> 00:40.139
<i> and share their story.</i>

00:40.241 --> 00:42.107
<i> And we're about to hear</i>
<i> a side of their story</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:45.044
<i> that they have never told</i>
<i> until today.</i>

00:45.146 --> 00:48.280
It's like you're in a cult.
The isolation that I had--

00:48.382 --> 00:49.748
I was a shell of a person.

00:49.850 --> 00:52.051
Hef doesn't like to use
protection.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.119
There was at one point
an std that went around.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.922
I got a call saying, like,
"hey, you're pregnant."

00:57.024 --> 00:58.524
I didn't want any part of it.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.660
He's just a creepy old man

01:01.762 --> 01:03.462
with power.

01:03.564 --> 01:07.766
♪♪♪

01:08.936 --> 01:13.205
♪♪♪

01:13.307 --> 01:16.475
you know, I've been fascinated

01:16.577 --> 01:19.078
with, uh, your stories,
because although

01:19.180 --> 01:21.513
I'm a chief investigative
correspondent

01:21.615 --> 01:22.648
on "inside edition"...

01:22.750 --> 01:24.416
Why would you
try to take advantage

01:24.518 --> 01:26.585
of young women like this?

01:26.687 --> 01:29.021
...When I was 20 and 21,
I used to be a "playboy" model.

01:29.123 --> 01:30.989
I shot for "playboy" lingerie,

01:31.092 --> 01:32.758
and then eventually
I did a cover...

01:32.860 --> 01:34.560
-Oh, wow. I didn't...
-...In 2006.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.496
And there are so many questions
I wanna ask you.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.766
I think the best way to do this
is to just talk about

01:40.868 --> 01:42.367
how you got there to begin with

01:42.470 --> 01:44.036
and a little bit
about your background.

01:44.138 --> 01:46.105
Tell me about your childhood
and--and how you grew up

01:46.207 --> 01:47.773
and where you grew up.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.374
We were three months premature.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.376
We were born
in ann arbor, michigan.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.913
Our biological mom was
never involved in our lives.

01:55.015 --> 01:56.515
We didn't even get
to really know our father.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.384
-He was very abusive.
-We always think to ourselves

01:59.487 --> 02:02.087
we were born into this life
together because we knew

02:02.189 --> 02:04.356
we were gonna need each other.
-We were gonna...

02:04.458 --> 02:08.727
That's so sweet, and that's, um,
that's really sad.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.230
Our father's side
is the one who raised us,

02:11.332 --> 02:13.465
so when we refer to "mom,"
that's--it's our grandma.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.067
-Your grandma.
-Annette.

02:15.169 --> 02:17.703
Yeah, our grandma.
But she's "mom" to us.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.037
And where did you grow up?

02:19.140 --> 02:21.306
We moved to
clearwater beach, florida,

02:21.408 --> 02:23.408
with our grandmother.

02:23.511 --> 02:26.678
She was really, like,
our stability, our foundation.

02:26.780 --> 02:29.581
When my grandfather passed away
of cancer,

02:29.683 --> 02:31.750
he had left her
under a mountain of debt,

02:31.852 --> 02:34.186
so we ended up having to move
off of clearwater beach

02:34.288 --> 02:36.155
and into a trailer park
in florida.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.423
-For four years.
-For four years.

02:38.526 --> 02:41.326
Basically, school wasn't
an option for us.

02:41.428 --> 02:42.961
We had to drop out
and get jobs.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.097
We worked at winghouse
as waitresses,

02:45.199 --> 02:46.498
which is the same exact outfit
like hooters.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.667
You have a dolphin short.

02:48.769 --> 02:50.469
And we always wanted
to be models,

02:50.571 --> 02:53.739
so this was like the beginning
of our modeling career,

02:53.841 --> 02:55.040
is being able to be like
winghouse girls,

02:55.142 --> 02:58.944
doing commercials, menus,
billboards.

02:59.046 --> 03:00.412
Wings, beer, and atmosphere.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.381
Both: And yes,
we're identical twins.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.650
All: Need we say more?

03:04.752 --> 03:06.919
How old were you when you first
started working for winghouse?

03:07.021 --> 03:08.554
Both: 15.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.522
And you kind of considered this
glamorous.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.823
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

03:11.926 --> 03:13.425
So we were like,
"this could be our chance."

03:13.527 --> 03:14.927
yeah.

03:15.029 --> 03:17.196
At what point did you start
watching "girls next door"?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.497
-15, 16.
-So I think that's when

03:18.599 --> 03:20.933
we were hostessing.
We were fans of the show.

03:21.035 --> 03:22.201
We were very much fans, yeah.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.369
And we loved kendra
and most identified with her.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.104
'cause she was the younger one.
She liked rap.

03:26.207 --> 03:28.440
She was more like hip-hop
like us.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.908
We liked rap music.

03:30.010 --> 03:33.478
This is interesting because
the fan base was young women.

03:33.581 --> 03:34.780
We knew there
would be some interest

03:34.882 --> 03:36.081
because it was
the playboy mansion.

03:36.183 --> 03:38.517
What I did not anticipate
was how

03:38.619 --> 03:40.152
hugely popular it would become,
and particularly,

03:40.254 --> 03:41.920
how hugely popular
with young women.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.389
We wanted to have their boobs.
We wanted to, like,

03:44.491 --> 03:45.691
we were dirty blonde naturally.

03:45.793 --> 03:47.159
We wanted to have
platinum blonde hair.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.460
So the playboy mansion--

03:48.562 --> 03:50.095
I'm, like,
it just looks like heaven.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.832
It's like you're royalty there,
and hef looks so nice.

03:53.934 --> 03:57.236
You viewed the mansion
as an adult disneyland.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.904
-Yes, exactly.
-Yeah.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.505
Did you ever think that<i> you</i>

04:00.608 --> 04:03.442
would end up
on "girls next door"?

04:03.544 --> 04:04.910
No, not at all.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.545
We just wanted to be models,
but, um,

04:06.647 --> 04:08.680
when we were watching
"the girls next door,"

04:08.782 --> 04:10.282
and we were modeling
for winghouse,

04:10.384 --> 04:11.783
the photographer's, like,

04:11.885 --> 04:14.386
"hey, I know how to get girls
into 'playboy.'"

04:14.488 --> 04:15.988
"and, like, do a photo shoot
and submit your photos."

04:16.090 --> 04:18.290
"and do a photo shoot
and submit your photos."

04:18.392 --> 04:19.391
-how old were you?
-Both: 17.

04:19.493 --> 04:21.026
-17.
-Both: Mm-hmm.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.628
So you're underage.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.829
-Underage, yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.631
Asked if you would be willing

04:25.733 --> 04:27.432
to take nude pictures
to send to "playboy."

04:27.534 --> 04:28.367
-yeah. Yeah.
-Correct.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.835
Now do you remember

04:29.937 --> 04:34.072
the first time that you posed
for "playboy"?

04:34.174 --> 04:35.874
We were flown out to miami
for a test shoot.

04:35.976 --> 04:39.111
-We had<i> just</i> turned 18.
-Mm-hmm.

04:39.213 --> 04:40.579
And, um, it was tasteful.

04:40.681 --> 04:42.381
That was al the first time
that I looked at a,

04:42.483 --> 04:45.617
you know, a monitor and seen
we're actually beautiful.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.952
-I've never had, you know...
-Hair and makeup done.

04:47.054 --> 04:48.887
...Professional hair and makeup
and all that.

04:48.989 --> 04:51.957
And it's like, oh, my gosh.
We are gorgeous.

04:52.059 --> 04:55.761
What happens next? How do you
actually get out to the mansion?

04:55.863 --> 04:57.996
Halfway through the test shoot
in miami,

04:58.098 --> 04:59.665
they were sending
the photos over,

04:59.767 --> 05:00.799
and all of a sudden, we see

05:00.901 --> 05:02.601
the photographer talking
really fast

05:02.703 --> 05:04.403
to someone on the phone.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.871
Then all of a sudden, they just
quit, and they're like,

05:05.973 --> 05:08.473
"hefner likes them.
He wants 'em there."

05:08.575 --> 05:09.574
and we were like... [gasps]

05:09.677 --> 05:11.543
"oh, my god. So we're playmates?
Did we make it?"

05:11.645 --> 05:13.211
and they're like,
"oh, yeah, you made it."

05:13.314 --> 05:15.314
-oh, my gosh. Hef loves them.
-They said hef loved the photos.

05:15.416 --> 05:17.382
They said holly loved
the photos.

05:17.484 --> 05:18.383
That must have been
an amazing feeling.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.352
-It was.
-It really was.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.587
They ended up
reaching out to us.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.089
Holly called, actually,

05:24.191 --> 05:26.224
and she said, "oh, you made
'playboy' playmate,"

05:26.327 --> 05:28.794
and they wanted us to fly out
to california to shoot

05:28.896 --> 05:30.762
55th anniversary
on the tv show.

05:30.864 --> 05:32.064
And we... [laughs]
so we quit our job.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.398
We quit winghouse,

05:33.500 --> 05:34.666
put together two luggage bags,

05:34.768 --> 05:36.601
and we're just getting ready
to go to california.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.071
And then on top of it, you're
going to the playboy mansion,

05:39.173 --> 05:42.674
and you're gonna be shooting
a tv show,

05:42.776 --> 05:45.444
and you're gonna be part
of the 55th anniversary search.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.912
It was a big deal.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.181
We had the hef 1 limo
pick us up...

05:49.283 --> 05:51.316
-They miked us.
-...From the airport.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.718
-Miked us right away.
-Yeah.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.386
So when we first drove up

05:54.488 --> 05:56.788
and saw
the mansion gates opening,

05:56.890 --> 05:59.291
this is what we saw on tv.
♪ come on-a my house ♪

05:59.393 --> 06:01.093
both: ♪ my house ♪

06:01.195 --> 06:02.828
driving up, it was like
you're in tv land.

06:02.930 --> 06:04.463
It just didn't seem real.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.764
It's like "willy wonka
and the chocolate factory."

06:05.866 --> 06:06.932
you're like, oh, my god.
I'm here.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.734
Or you're like,
the golden ticket.

06:08.836 --> 06:09.868
You know what I mean?
Like, oh, my god.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.336
I got the golden ticket.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.171
And we're just driving up
to shoot our centerfold,

06:13.273 --> 06:15.540
and then they, like, stopped
at the security gate,

06:15.642 --> 06:17.042
and they were like,

06:17.144 --> 06:18.343
"okay, we're gonna film you guys
getting out,"

06:18.445 --> 06:19.478
and they just started
directing you right away,

06:19.580 --> 06:20.946
and we just signed
a release form.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.215
They're like, "you guys are
gonna sign this release form."

06:23.317 --> 06:24.716
did you read it
before you signed it?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.151
No.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.452
Never read a contract
in our life.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.920
-Didn't know what we were doing.
-We just--we were 18.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.722
Once you're there
and you're seeing, like,

06:30.824 --> 06:32.691
it's like don't meet your hero
behind the curtain or whatever,

06:32.793 --> 06:35.093
that's, like,
totally what it was.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.229
It just started
becoming a job right away.

06:37.331 --> 06:38.663
I remember seeing holly
for the first time,

06:38.766 --> 06:42.601
and it was a completely
different person.

06:42.703 --> 06:43.935
What do you mean?

06:44.037 --> 06:45.203
Like, before the cameraman
would get her walking

06:45.305 --> 06:46.838
into the house,
she'd just be like, you know,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.473
sitting there, you know, fixing
her lipstick or whatever.

06:48.575 --> 06:49.775
Drinking.

06:49.877 --> 06:51.910
-Wouldn't even talk to you.
-You know?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.044
And then when the cameras
would go up,

06:53.147 --> 06:55.013
she's just back into character
again.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.615
All of it was for sure fake.

06:56.717 --> 07:00.685
And that's one thing that hef
was a genius at--was his image.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.621
-You thought it was fake.
-Mm-hmm.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.556
You didn't think
that he was really sleeping

07:04.658 --> 07:06.691
with these young girls.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.059
Hell, no. You don't think
an 80-year-old man

07:08.162 --> 07:10.462
is sleeping
with three of these women.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.463
Did it, uh, occur to you
at some point

07:11.565 --> 07:14.065
that the girls had boyfriends?

07:14.168 --> 07:16.168
I actually thought that holly,

07:16.270 --> 07:17.769
since she was
the main girlfriend,

07:17.871 --> 07:20.539
I thought that she, you know,
was really trying to marry hef.

07:20.641 --> 07:24.976
For bridget, I kinda feel like
she was just holly's sidekick,

07:25.078 --> 07:26.445
but with kendra,
you could totally tell that

07:26.547 --> 07:29.214
she had dated on the side.

07:29.316 --> 07:33.418
Was it starting to occur to you
that these three women

07:33.520 --> 07:35.086
were on their way out the door,

07:35.189 --> 07:38.123
and they were gonna be looking
for new girlfriends?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.958
We didn't think they were
leaving at all.

07:40.060 --> 07:42.527
Okay, so then from there,
you go home.

07:42.629 --> 07:43.829
And then what happened?

07:43.931 --> 07:46.832
Yeah, so hef wrote a letter,
old school,

07:46.934 --> 07:49.568
and he said, "I would love for
you guys to be my girlfriends

07:49.670 --> 07:53.004
and to move in with me

07:53.106 --> 07:55.407
and film
'the girls next door' show."

07:55.509 --> 07:57.509
so when we got the letter,
we were like,

07:57.611 --> 07:59.177
of course, we're gonna go.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.780
You knew what it meant
to have a boyfriend...

08:01.882 --> 08:02.948
-Mm-hmm.
-...Which is, at your age now,

08:03.050 --> 08:04.082
a sexual relationship.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.217
-Mm-hmm.
-Right.

08:05.319 --> 08:08.153
Did you view the words
in that letter

08:08.255 --> 08:09.287
as something sexual?
-No. [laughs]

08:09.389 --> 08:10.922
no. No, no, no.
Not at all. [laughs]

08:11.024 --> 08:12.991
when he said--when he said
to move in and be girlfriends

08:13.093 --> 08:14.326
and live at the mansion...

08:14.428 --> 08:15.794
We were girlfriends on the show.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.096
...We thought, okay,
come be part of the tv show.

08:18.198 --> 08:20.699
You thought you were gonna be
cast members in a tv show.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.167
-Yeah. Exactly.
-Exactly.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.436
It was the best thing that's
gonna happen to us from the life

08:24.538 --> 08:26.371
that we were coming from.
This was insanely huge.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.006
So you joined the show.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.975
How soon afterwards
do you realize

08:30.077 --> 08:31.276
that you're supposed to have

08:31.378 --> 08:33.879
a relationship with hef
off-camera?

08:33.981 --> 08:35.847
Almost six months we were there.

08:35.949 --> 08:38.149
So during that six months...

08:38.252 --> 08:39.417
The other girls
were transitioning out.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.886
...The other girls,
the old girls next door

08:40.988 --> 08:42.654
were transitioning out,
so, like, we would hear

08:42.756 --> 08:44.523
on speakerphone,
kendra ordering, like, pasta

08:44.625 --> 08:47.559
and all the stuff and we were
like, what the hell?

08:47.661 --> 08:49.227
She was pregnant,
and we didn't know.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.162
So we were, like, we heard that,
like, we were, like,

08:51.265 --> 08:53.899
understanding holly's staying
in a separate bedroom now.

08:54.001 --> 08:58.003
And on our 19th birthday,
we all went out to a club,

08:58.105 --> 09:00.405
and that was the night that
realized we were...

09:00.507 --> 09:02.073
-What we got ourselves into.
-...What we got ourselves into.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.875
Like, this is what it is.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.611
So you turn 19,
and you all go out.

09:06.713 --> 09:07.913
And what happens next?

09:08.015 --> 09:09.414
We had a bunch of the playmates

09:09.516 --> 09:10.849
that are shooting from our year.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.651
Holly was with us.
Kendra was with us.

09:12.753 --> 09:13.952
We were all going out

09:14.054 --> 09:16.388
to a nightclub
for our 19th birthday.

09:16.490 --> 09:19.491
And we were drinking,
and then on the way back,

09:19.593 --> 09:21.459
kendra in the limo is like,
"you guys wanna smoke weed?

09:21.562 --> 09:23.261
Do you guys smoke weed?"

09:23.363 --> 09:24.829
and we're like,
"hell, yeah, we smoke weed."

09:24.932 --> 09:26.331
so we get back to the mansion,
and we went upstairs

09:26.433 --> 09:29.267
to smoke weed in hef's room.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.203
And at the time,
holly was not in there.

09:32.306 --> 09:36.775
So it was me, karissa,
kendra, and hef.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.243
But when we all went
to go smoke pot,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.845
kendra didn't smoke.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.948
So she leaves right when we're
all going to smoke pot.

09:43.050 --> 09:46.551
It was just me, you, and hef,
and he knew we were nervous.

09:46.653 --> 09:48.186
We were super nervous
when kendra left.

09:48.288 --> 09:49.454
-We didn't feel comfortable.
-Super nervous 'cause...

09:49.556 --> 09:51.556
And then he says,
"hey, you could take this.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.725
It will make...
You won't be so nervous."

09:53.827 --> 09:55.160
hugh hefner offers you a pill.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.127
-Pills.
-Mm-hmm.

09:56.229 --> 09:57.629
And...

09:57.731 --> 09:59.097
There were a couple pills
in his hand.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.732
-A couple of pills.
-Mm-hmm.

10:00.834 --> 10:02.334
-Do you take them?
-Both: Yeah.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.635

-He's 83. You're 19.
-Correct.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.706
So did you think that
you would be having sex

10:07.808 --> 10:09.841
with hugh hefner that night?

10:09.943 --> 10:10.976
Both: No.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.278
-Not at all. No.
-Mnh-mnh.

You've been to the club.

10:18.085 --> 10:19.618

10:30.130 --> 10:32.163

10:34.501 --> 10:37.335

25:08.374 --> 25:10.474
one of those two times,
you got pregnant.

25:10.576 --> 25:11.742
Mm-hmm.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.179
You know, he's having sex
with you unprotected.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.248
Um, you know,
you were old enough

25:17.350 --> 25:18.883
to know how people get pregnant.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.217
I didn't think that I would

25:20.319 --> 25:22.186
because I knew holly was
trying to get pregnant,

25:22.288 --> 25:25.422
and I knew that holly tried
so hard,

25:25.525 --> 25:27.658
so I was like,
maybe we're in the clear.

25:27.760 --> 25:29.159
-Didn't think it was possible.
-I didn't think it was possible.

25:29.262 --> 25:30.628
And again, how old is he?

25:30.730 --> 25:31.929
-84.
-84.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.731
Like, you don't really think
that would happen.

25:33.833 --> 25:34.865
But we were--we were about
the youngest girlfriends

25:34.967 --> 25:37.001
he had had.

25:37.103 --> 25:39.303
It was the end of 19.
I was gonna turn 20.

25:39.405 --> 25:41.705
I had no idea
until the blood test

25:41.807 --> 25:44.775
for my surgery, so a blood test
is what told me.

25:44.877 --> 25:48.746
We had plans to get our noses
done and our boobs done.

25:48.848 --> 25:52.016
So I got a call saying, like,
"hey, you're pregnant,

25:52.118 --> 25:54.418
and you have the surgery
coming up," and that's--

25:54.520 --> 25:57.721
I freaked. Like, I'm, like,
"who else knows about this?"

25:57.823 --> 25:58.756
and they're like,
"well, we just called you,"

25:58.858 --> 26:01.292
and I was like,
"don't call mary.

26:01.394 --> 26:03.227
Don't call hef.
Don't call anyone.

26:03.329 --> 26:04.662
I don't want anyone knowing."

26:04.764 --> 26:06.163
it's hard to hide things
at the mansion.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.432
Wait. The first reaction
that you had...

26:08.534 --> 26:10.067
-Was scared.
-...Was "who knows?"

26:10.169 --> 26:12.236
who knows?
Who in the office knows?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.638
Why didn't you feel like you
could go to hugh hefner

26:14.740 --> 26:16.607
and say, "hef, I'm pregnant"?

26:16.709 --> 26:19.843
I didn't want him to know
that I was pregnant.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.512
I didn't want him to want me
to have it.

26:21.614 --> 26:26.183
I didn't wanna be stuck
even more inside that bubble.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.619
I think it's a way for him
to control me even more...

26:28.721 --> 26:30.688
-I see.
-...Having me on a leash.

26:30.790 --> 26:32.323
Yeah.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.891
I felt disgusted with my body.
I didn't--

26:33.993 --> 26:37.695
I felt like there was something,
like, like, an alien inside me.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.263
I was just grossed out.

26:39.365 --> 26:43.100
[voice breaking] I just wanted
to get it over and done with,

26:43.202 --> 26:44.134
and... [sighs]

26:44.236 --> 26:45.903
I called around
for a few clinics.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.037
And, um,
'cause we didn't wanna--

26:47.139 --> 26:49.306
'cause security
couldn't take us there

26:49.408 --> 26:50.841
'cause otherwise
hef would've found out.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.110
Um, 'cause if we were together,
I knew we would get a...

26:53.212 --> 26:55.179
A lot more attention
or a chance of paparazzi

26:55.281 --> 26:57.314
walking in an abortion clinic.

26:57.416 --> 27:00.584
You two do everything together,

27:00.686 --> 27:03.520
but at this crucial moment
in your life,

27:03.623 --> 27:08.325
you have to walk in alone 'cause
you're worried about paparazzi.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.795
That is, to me,
so gut-wrenching and sad.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.230
-Yeah.
-You had to be alone.

27:13.332 --> 27:15.532
-[exhales deeply]
-I'm so sorry.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.469
I can't imagine what
the two of you went through.

27:18.571 --> 27:19.770
That's a double life.

27:19.872 --> 27:21.605
That's why we love each other
so much, too.

27:21.707 --> 27:24.174
We really are strong
for each other, you know?

27:24.276 --> 27:25.809
Yeah, you are.

27:25.911 --> 27:29.446
So, uh, I called my good friend
juicy j from--

27:29.548 --> 27:30.814
he's a rapper
from three 6 mafia,

27:30.916 --> 27:32.983
but we're really close.

27:33.085 --> 27:37.054
So I made an appointment, and we
went to sherman oaks mall,

27:37.156 --> 27:38.956
got dropped off and said
we were going shopping,

27:39.058 --> 27:41.792
and juicy j picked us up
at valet right away,

27:41.894 --> 27:44.728
drove us in his car, and we
dropped karissa off by herself.

27:44.830 --> 27:48.132
I did the procedure, came out,
got in his car,

27:48.234 --> 27:50.300
and they dropped us back off
at the mall,

27:50.403 --> 27:52.202
and she ran up and purchased,
like, two thongs

27:52.304 --> 27:54.938
from victoria's secret
to act like we went shopping.

27:55.041 --> 27:56.607
Then we went back
to the mansion,

27:56.709 --> 27:58.409
and then all of a sudden,
hef's like,

27:58.511 --> 28:00.144
"oh, we have to film

28:00.246 --> 28:02.179
for 'the girls next door' promo
opening."

28:02.281 --> 28:04.448
I think it was like
two days later, maybe.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.884
And they wanted us for
that opening to be in bikinis

28:06.986 --> 28:08.719
and all this stuff,
and I couldn't go down there

28:08.821 --> 28:11.755
'cause my stomach was swollen
and I was bleeding a lot.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.525
I just, uh, laid in bed and
tried to play like I was sick.

28:14.627 --> 28:17.895
And then lauren,
our main field producer,

28:17.997 --> 28:19.730
shuts the door and says,
"what's going on?"

28:19.832 --> 28:21.231
I had to tell someone.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.168
Kristina says,
"karissa just had an abortion."

28:24.270 --> 28:28.205
and lauren, thank god,
she didn't say anything.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.340
But she did say, "well, what do
you want me to tell hef?"

28:30.443 --> 28:32.276
so then hef comes up,
and I'm crying,

28:32.378 --> 28:33.911
and he's like, "what's wrong?"

28:34.013 --> 28:36.046
I said, "I'm sick.
I just can't film."

28:36.148 --> 28:38.282
he's like,
"well, we could do it tomorrow."

28:38.384 --> 28:39.616
and I said, "no,"
'cause I don't know

28:39.719 --> 28:41.251
if I'm gonna be all right
by tomorrow.

28:41.353 --> 28:42.419
So hef's like,
"whatever you wanna do,"

28:42.521 --> 28:45.189
and, like, leaves, all mad,

28:45.291 --> 28:47.257
and then that's the first time
we've said no.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.093
We never say no to filming.

28:49.195 --> 28:50.694
Lauren said, "all right,
how about this, karissa?

28:50.796 --> 28:53.497
You do your hair and makeup
and go down,

28:53.599 --> 28:55.532
and we will cut--put your head
on your sister's body

28:55.634 --> 28:58.168
if she's okay with it."

28:58.270 --> 29:02.573
so, yeah, um,
and then this opening,

29:02.675 --> 29:06.977
my head--it's kristina's body.
My head's put on her body.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.278
I was the body double
for both of us.

29:08.380 --> 29:09.913
She was the body double
for both of us

29:10.015 --> 29:11.548
this day of the shoot
for the opening.

29:11.650 --> 29:15.252
[voice breaking] I went down
and put on different bikinis.

29:15.354 --> 29:18.889
And...That's the opening for
"the girls next door"

29:18.991 --> 29:20.824
and the bobblehead thing.

29:20.926 --> 29:23.427
I mean, in a way, you were
almost more concerned

29:23.529 --> 29:27.064
about this reality show opening

29:27.166 --> 29:29.600
than you were about
your own body and health.

29:29.702 --> 29:33.537
[crying] so...It's hard watching
the opening for it.

29:33.639 --> 29:34.705
[sniffles]

29:34.807 --> 29:38.575
the fact that you were pregnant
by somebody

29:38.677 --> 29:40.277
that you didn't
wanna have sex with...

29:40.379 --> 29:44.314
Every time I've done it with him
it's assault.

29:44.416 --> 29:48.852
I'm ni--I'm a kid.
I'm 19 years old.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.188
I'm not even old enough
to drink yet.

29:51.290 --> 29:56.326
And he is just a creepy old man
with power.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.630
Women don't understand that
they can say no. [sniffles]

29:59.732 --> 30:04.501
I'm sorry. It's so hard
to talk about, you know?

30:04.603 --> 30:07.571
Do you look back
and think to yourself

30:07.673 --> 30:09.506
that you made
the right decision?

30:09.608 --> 30:11.508
100% I did, yeah.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.243
Everyone, to each their own...

30:13.345 --> 30:16.847
But for me it's like rape.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.348
He would use control mechanisms

30:18.450 --> 30:19.783
completely
throughout everything,

30:19.885 --> 30:22.586
so I'm happy that I had
the abortion.

30:22.688 --> 30:24.321
Because you felt like
he raped you.

30:24.423 --> 30:25.355
Yeah.

30:25.457 --> 30:27.624
♪♪♪

30:30.296 --> 30:31.628
[paparazzi shouting at once]

30:31.730 --> 30:33.997
you know, while we were there,
we also had a lot of opportunity

30:34.099 --> 30:35.899
besides being
"playboy" playmates.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.734
Like, movies, commercials.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.103
We did the "guitar hero"
commercial with brett ratner.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.271
We've done l'oréal France.

30:41.373 --> 30:45.175
We've done, like,
just tons of stuff,

30:45.277 --> 30:47.644
and we did the "somewhere"
with sofia coppola.

30:47.746 --> 30:50.581
Can you tell me how you got
that role in that film?

30:50.683 --> 30:53.650
Sofia coppola contacted
the mansion.

30:53.752 --> 30:55.786
They asked us,
"hey, we have a part..."

30:55.888 --> 30:57.221
"do you want to come audition?"

30:57.323 --> 30:58.255
"...We want you guys to come
and audition for."

30:58.357 --> 30:59.356
-she said--
-and then you got it.

30:59.458 --> 31:00.991
Both: Yeah, we got it.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.126
And hef was shocked. So they
made a whole episode about it.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.465
<i> Thanks for having us.</i>

31:16.108 --> 31:17.441
Oh, yeah.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.843
-Oh.
-"fan of your father."

31:19.945 --> 31:23.280
she's so uncomfortable. Like,
he gave a backhanded compliment.

31:23.382 --> 31:25.415
It was almost like
he was groveling to her.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.617
Both: Yeah.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.218
Clearly,
he really loves celebrities.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.786
-It comes with movies.
-Yeah, he loves movies.

31:29.889 --> 31:31.288
-It's a big deal.
-It's movies.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.756
I'll tell you,
this was the thing.

31:32.858 --> 31:35.859
When our, uh, red carpet came
for the premiere,

31:35.961 --> 31:37.661
for the movie,
we didn't want him to go,

31:37.763 --> 31:40.230
'cause I knew it was gonna be
more about him,

31:40.332 --> 31:41.932
and he was gonna bring
other women

31:42.034 --> 31:45.002
and make it more about them,
and to us, this was, like,

31:45.104 --> 31:47.437
our--we did this.
We got this on our own.

31:47.539 --> 31:49.740
Can we have this to ourselves?

31:49.842 --> 31:50.974
And so we told him

31:51.076 --> 31:52.442
we didn't want him
to come to the premiere,

31:52.544 --> 31:55.379
and he said, "well, I'll send
you with security in a limo,

31:55.481 --> 31:56.380
but you have to do movie night."

31:56.482 --> 31:58.348
"you have to stay
for movie night..."

31:58.450 --> 31:59.783
-and dinner.
-"...And dinner as normal."

31:59.885 --> 32:01.285
and this was what was
embarrassing.

32:01.387 --> 32:04.521
By the time the movie ended,
we jumped up, got in the limo,

32:04.623 --> 32:06.657
and by the time we got
to the premiere,

32:06.759 --> 32:10.027
it was already halfway through
the beginning of the movie.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.194
Sofia was waiting for us.

32:11.297 --> 32:12.863
He made you miss
your premiere...

32:12.965 --> 32:13.964
-Both: Yeah.
-...And the red carpet

32:14.066 --> 32:15.299
of your premiere.
-Both: Yep.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.466
-So when--
-was he jealous?

32:16.568 --> 32:17.901
-100% he was jealous.
-It was like

32:18.003 --> 32:19.236
he's now losing control
of you, too,

32:19.338 --> 32:22.406
'cause you're out there starting
to make your own career.

32:22.508 --> 32:23.640
Yep.

32:23.742 --> 32:24.574
And it's almost like
he couldn't handle it.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.310
Yeah.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.578
He's actually made a lot
of money off of us

32:28.681 --> 32:31.114
from just us living there.

32:31.216 --> 32:33.850
He really resented the success
of the other girls that left,

32:33.953 --> 32:36.653
and he didn't want us to leave.

32:36.755 --> 32:40.023
Let's talk about
how you were able,

32:40.125 --> 32:43.794
and I'm gonna use this word,
escape.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.062
We actually were scared.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.863
We didn't know how
to break up with him,

32:46.966 --> 32:48.231
so we went
to mary o'connor's office

32:48.334 --> 32:50.467
and told her we didn't
wanna be there anymore

32:50.569 --> 32:53.737
but didn't know how
to tell hef that.

32:53.839 --> 32:56.440
It was like an hour goes by
and then she calls us,

32:56.542 --> 32:57.808
and says, "hey, uh, come--
you girls come down here.

32:57.910 --> 32:59.943
I've got hef in here,"
and we were scared."

33:00.045 --> 33:02.045
-mm-hmm.
-He was pissed.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.082
He said, "okay, so you guys
wanna break up with me?"

33:05.184 --> 33:07.684
and we're like, "yeah."

33:07.786 --> 33:11.054
he said, "well, how about you go
and live at the bunny house?"

33:11.156 --> 33:13.323
hef had a lot of the girls
staying at the bunny house,

33:13.425 --> 33:15.759
which was across the street
from the mansion,

33:15.861 --> 33:19.963
and he said, "I'll give you guys
$500 a week rather than $1,000.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.098
-"you have to attend..."
-attend.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.833
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.

33:22.935 --> 33:26.670
We agreed, but the first night,
we went out to a, um, nightclub.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.438
He saw that we were getting
a lot of press,

33:28.540 --> 33:30.741
and he did not like it, and--

33:30.843 --> 33:32.976
so he said, "you stay here
at the mansion,

33:33.078 --> 33:34.511
and you can't be seen out,

33:34.613 --> 33:36.913
or you guys have to leave
the playmate house,"

33:37.016 --> 33:40.784
and we're like, you know what?
That's great for us,

33:40.886 --> 33:43.253

maybe ask a friend
to read social media for you

something snarky about somebody

39:24.996 --> 39:27.030
that you see on tv

is that other people
are reading that tweet

39:28.600 --> 39:32.669

considering coming forward.

39:35.207 --> 39:36.773

victimization for survivors.
