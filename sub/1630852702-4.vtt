WEBVTT

00:11.177 --> 00:12.929
Twenty seconds to impact!

00:13.013 --> 00:15.181
The number of fragments keeps increasing.

00:15.765 --> 00:18.184
The five of them
are heading to the moored shuttle.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.437
The shuttle area is decompressing.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.939
Maintain pressure until they evacuate!

00:26.776 --> 00:30.196
-What happened to the shuttle?
-The radar is blank. I can't tell.

00:30.280 --> 00:32.699
We'll run out of air in here soon too.

00:32.782 --> 00:34.492
Abandon the control room.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.413
All crew, move to the sub-control room!

00:40.165 --> 00:41.791
4 HOURS, 42 MINUTES, 30 SECONDS
AFTER ACCIDENT

00:41.875 --> 00:45.462
The comet fragments are still going around
at the same altitude.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.173
This is probably an AI comet.

00:48.256 --> 00:50.049
An AI comet?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.844
Yeah.
An unmanned vehicle is sent to the comet

00:52.927 --> 00:55.847
and sprays out a micro machine
that self-propagates

00:55.930 --> 00:59.434
and automatically creates
a membrane-like computer and engine.

00:59.517 --> 01:04.230
The AI does everything,
so it's cheaper than lunar water.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.691
-Mayor?
-What?

01:06.775 --> 01:08.193
This is bad.

01:08.276 --> 01:12.072
The second orbit of the comet group
is coming!

01:12.155 --> 01:13.198
Hold on!

01:14.282 --> 01:15.992
5 HOURS, 21 MINUTES, 10 SECONDS
AFTER ACCIDENT

01:16.076 --> 01:17.202
Any damage?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.789
Looks like we still have air.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.707
Mayor.

01:22.791 --> 01:24.292
What is that?

01:24.793 --> 01:26.711
Touya, are you safe?

01:26.795 --> 01:28.296
<i>Uncle!</i>

01:28.379 --> 01:32.509
Touya, you have to survive long enough
for the UN2 rescue ship to come.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.219
<i>We will.</i>

01:35.053 --> 01:36.721
Just a little longer, guys.

01:37.305 --> 01:39.224
We're going to solve the problem.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.476
It's what you said, but…

01:41.559 --> 01:42.769
EPISODE 4: SEVEN'S PATTERN

01:42.852 --> 01:44.813
We have to open the bulkheads above

01:44.896 --> 01:48.233
to be able to get on the UN2 rescue ship.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.276
Connected.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.738
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>With this, we can always communicate.</i>

01:53.822 --> 01:57.784
I'm not sure if it will work well or not,
but I have an idea.

01:57.867 --> 01:59.077
Dakky.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.498
Even if Twelve can't do it,

02:03.581 --> 02:06.584
we might be able to reboot
with a separate system.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.507
A while back, I hacked
a security hole in the bird drones.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.051
When on earth did you do that?

02:15.135 --> 02:16.136
<i>Align.</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:20.140
All right, get in formation.

02:21.349 --> 02:22.517
Forward.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.646
You in front, more to the right.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.400
Hacking is a major violation of the rules.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.777
Shall I stop the reboot then?

02:33.695 --> 02:35.905
No. Carry on.

02:36.614 --> 02:40.160
All right. It looks like the lower system
can be restored right away.

02:40.243 --> 02:42.579
If I fiddle with this,
communications will be restored.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.664
The birds were drones?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.295
Communications have been restored.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.505
What a terrifying nephew you have.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.924
Touya,
are you able to access the bulkhead?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.428
No, we can't get in.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.805
Some things work and some don't.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.307
How are they different?

03:02.390 --> 03:03.641
I don't know,

03:03.725 --> 03:06.936
but the things that aren't working
are those that incorporate quantum AI.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.648
The net's back!

03:14.110 --> 03:16.070
Mina, everybody!

03:16.154 --> 03:17.697
I'm still alive.

03:17.780 --> 03:21.701
What? "Everybody around the world
is relaying the Mina broadcast"?

03:21.784 --> 03:23.453
I'm world-famous?

03:23.536 --> 03:24.537
IN THE RANKING

03:24.621 --> 03:26.205
Thirty million followers?

03:26.289 --> 03:28.708
Yay! One-third of my goal.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.960
I've conquered worldwide.
Next is universe-wide.

03:31.044 --> 03:31.961
FOLLOWERS

03:33.046 --> 03:35.048
Another failure.

03:35.131 --> 03:37.800
-I'm sorry.
-If you make a mistake, you can try again.

03:37.884 --> 03:38.968
Yeah.

03:39.052 --> 03:42.472
But a mistake in space could be deadly,
so I'll be careful.

03:42.555 --> 03:46.517
True. But the most dangerous thing
isn't making a mistake.

03:46.601 --> 03:49.395
Giving up after making a mistake
is the most dangerous.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.480
Right.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.233
Today's Hero Interview.

03:53.316 --> 03:56.736
This is the famous Touya,
universally renowned.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.030
Touya, how do you feel?

03:59.113 --> 04:00.114
Shut up.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.243
There you have it.
Universally nasty as always.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.872
By the way, Touya,
you call your partner drone Dakky,

04:07.956 --> 04:09.958
but what is its formal name?

04:10.625 --> 04:11.876
Darkness Killer.

04:13.503 --> 04:15.380
Did you just laugh?

04:15.838 --> 04:18.591
No way. It's a cool name.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.135
That's why its nickname is Dakky,
isn't it?

04:21.219 --> 04:22.512
Go away!

04:22.595 --> 04:25.181
-You're in the way, Earther!
-You're in the way, Earther!

04:25.265 --> 04:27.350
If you open up this pathway--

04:27.433 --> 04:29.060
What are you eating?

04:29.143 --> 04:31.854
-Shut up, Earther!
-Shut up, Earther!

04:32.438 --> 04:33.815
Favorite word?

04:34.440 --> 04:36.943
-Drop dead, Earther!
-Drop dead, Earther!

04:37.026 --> 04:38.569
What are you doing?

04:38.653 --> 04:41.656
-You're an Earther too, you know!
-Just go away!

04:41.739 --> 04:43.366
Don't bother Touya!

04:43.449 --> 04:45.076
Fine, whatever.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.996
-I got loads of usable footage.
-<i>A meteorite should be dropped on Earth</i>

04:48.079 --> 04:50.581
<i>and should reduce</i>
<i>Earth's population by one-third.</i>

04:50.665 --> 04:54.794
-<i>Drop dead, Earther!</i>
-I'll gather all of these and up they go.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.129
SHOCKING! TOUYA'S TRUE COLORS

04:56.212 --> 04:59.048
There. The details
of our current time line are displaying.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.133
SIGNAL 22%

05:00.216 --> 05:01.634
UN2?

05:01.718 --> 05:03.886
<i>The UN2 signal's coming in.</i>

05:03.970 --> 05:06.514
<i>The UN2 rescue ship</i>
<i>is currently approaching.</i>

05:06.597 --> 05:09.017
<i>It will rendezvous with the Anshin</i>
<i>in one hour.</i>

05:09.100 --> 05:12.312
-It's UN2. UN2 has come.
-Yes!

05:12.395 --> 05:14.063
Yes, we're saved!

05:14.147 --> 05:16.149
Just what you'd expect
of humanity's representatives.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.650
They didn't forget about us.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.944
-All right.
-What's up?

05:20.028 --> 05:22.655
The timelines have converged.
It won't be long now.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.533
Text-only communication
has been established.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.077
What's happening with the comet?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.122
The fragments from the comet
that collided with the Anshin

05:31.205 --> 05:32.874
have scattered around a wide area

05:32.957 --> 05:35.626
and are burning up and evaporating
in the atmosphere.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.337
The danger is subsiding.

05:37.420 --> 05:41.049
However, this says that there is
a risk of contact with the Anshin

05:41.132 --> 05:42.341
in the next few hours.

05:42.425 --> 05:45.344
An exact match
with the Anshin's orbital plane?

05:45.428 --> 05:47.430
How is such a coincidence possible?

05:47.513 --> 05:48.514
There's more.

05:48.598 --> 05:51.309
However, aside from the other things
that entered low orbit,

05:51.392 --> 05:56.731
Alpha, the large, main body
is about to collide with Earth again.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.066
COMET 88%

05:58.149 --> 05:59.317
NUCLEAR ATTACK 87%

05:59.400 --> 06:00.985
A nuclear attack?

06:01.069 --> 06:05.073
<i>UN2 will soon be carrying out</i>
<i>a second nuclear strike on Alpha.</i>

06:05.156 --> 06:08.659
<i>If that happens, the EMP will destroy the</i>
<i>electrical equipment on the rescue ship</i>

06:08.743 --> 06:10.536
<i>and won't carry out the rescue.</i>

06:10.620 --> 06:12.580
<i>You have to escape before that happens.</i>

06:12.663 --> 06:15.249
<i>Everything-- both reacceleration</i>
<i>and opening the bulkhead--</i>

06:15.333 --> 06:17.960
<i>all hinges upon rebooting Twelve.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:21.089
<i>I'm sorry to ask this of you civilians,</i>
<i>but help us.</i>

06:21.172 --> 06:24.342
<i>Touya, would you be able</i>
<i>to reboot Twelve with Dakky</i>

06:24.425 --> 06:26.636
<i>using that security hole from before?</i>

06:26.719 --> 06:29.305
That would be difficult
with Dakky's current cognition level.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.349
What about your drone?

06:31.432 --> 06:34.769
Bright was not made to be used
for those kinds of rules violations.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.938
Then there is one way.

06:37.021 --> 06:40.233
Unlock up to the C limiter
of Dakky's cognitive restrictions.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.901
No way!

06:41.984 --> 06:45.196
<i>Taiyou, I'm counting on you.</i>
<i>I will take responsibility.</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:47.782
We don't know what will happen.

06:47.865 --> 06:49.659
-Bright.
-Aye. Copy.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.748
Do it, Dakky.

06:59.877 --> 07:01.921
All right. Good job, Dakky.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.258
I never thought I would end up
having a hand in such illegal activity.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.262
It booted up.

07:11.347 --> 07:15.268
I am Deegle's advanced general purpose AI,
Twelve.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.479
Twelve was made for the prosperity
and development of human--

07:18.563 --> 07:20.440
-Twelve, shut up.
-Shutting up.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.151
Twelve, open the blockage
in the B Cylinder.

07:23.234 --> 07:25.319
Secure oxygen
for the passage through here.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.781
Initializing air pressure modification
for the passage from B Cylinder.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.659
<i>Touya, the bulkhead is opening.</i>

07:31.742 --> 07:32.660
MINA 81%

07:32.743 --> 07:35.705
-Mina?
-It has started hitting individuals.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.789
CLOSE 92%

07:36.873 --> 07:39.125
Hey! Where are you going?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.878
This is another chance
to increase my followers!

07:41.961 --> 07:45.047
What are you doing, you LoserTuber?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.551
Nasa, what is that app?

07:48.634 --> 07:50.178
Oh, well…

07:50.261 --> 07:53.306
Is that the <i>Seven Poem</i> prophecy
you've always talked about?

07:53.389 --> 07:54.640
Yes.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.686
Actually, it's an app that analyzes the
poem and displays future possibilities.

07:58.769 --> 08:01.314
Does this mean that Mina
is going to get trapped over there?

08:01.397 --> 08:02.315
EROSION 84%

08:02.398 --> 08:04.609
-Oh, no.
-Wait.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.818
But--

08:06.903 --> 08:09.322
Mina's reaching the top.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.659
Why is it closing?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.204
Twelve, what's wrong? Don't close it.

08:17.079 --> 08:20.208
-Why did you stop me?
-It would disturb the timeline.

08:21.375 --> 08:25.213
If we told them, the future
that Seven predicted would change.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.214
Nasa.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.133
Can you see what's happening inside?

08:29.217 --> 08:32.011
No.
I can't access the surveillance camera.

08:32.094 --> 08:33.638
I found her.

08:33.721 --> 08:37.391
I'm going to make this into a story
and increase my followers.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.476
FAKE?

08:38.559 --> 08:40.394
Mina, everybody!

08:40.478 --> 08:42.897
Twelve, open the bulkhead.

08:42.980 --> 08:47.610
I've lost the control function
for each of the panels.

08:47.693 --> 08:49.320
What does that mean?

08:49.403 --> 08:51.781
Report the location of function loss.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.116
Most of it is around the A Cylinder.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.536
What is this?

08:56.619 --> 09:00.498
Nasa, hasn't it predicted a way
to open the bulkhead?

09:00.581 --> 09:03.543
This doesn't really work like that.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.545
The "S" Pattern?

09:06.128 --> 09:09.048
The "S" Pattern is growing.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.008
That pattern--

09:11.092 --> 09:14.220
It's the same
as the surface of the comet that crashed.

09:14.303 --> 09:17.306
The area in the pattern
matches the area we've lost control of.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.975
Is that the cause?

09:19.058 --> 09:23.145
It's the micro machine
that forms the quantum AI of the comet.

09:23.229 --> 09:26.190
Has it mistaken the station
for the comet it's attached to?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.610
That is unknown. However,
it is possible that this abnormal growth

09:29.694 --> 09:33.197
means that some kind of modification
has been made.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.950
Everything that's happened has been
predicted frighteningly accurately.

09:36.033 --> 09:36.951
TWELVE 97%

09:37.618 --> 09:38.703
Twelve?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.289
Is this some kind of hacking?

09:41.372 --> 09:42.498
That is unclear,

09:42.582 --> 09:47.753
but it is indiscriminately hacking
nearby devices and trying to assimilate--

09:49.171 --> 09:51.465
-Twelve?
-What happened, Twelve?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.301
My apologies.

09:53.384 --> 09:57.013
In 13 minutes, 11 seconds, I will die.

09:57.930 --> 10:01.684
I am currently being exposed to erosion.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.853
There is one way to stop the erosion.

10:03.936 --> 10:06.480
We'll help. What do we need to do?

10:06.564 --> 10:11.235
Give me permission to further unlock
the cognitive limiters of Touya's drone.

10:11.319 --> 10:12.320
What?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.071
-GOSH
-SHE'S TRAPPED

10:14.155 --> 10:18.117
In terms of intelligence, only that AI
is capable of correcting the situation.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.079
-<i>I went inside, and the door just closed.</i>
-My sister is making such a mess!

10:22.163 --> 10:24.707
-<i>It's not my fault.</i>
-I'm so, so--

10:24.790 --> 10:27.793
Papa-- I mean, Dad.

10:28.294 --> 10:31.005
Yeah? I'm kind of busy right now.

10:31.922 --> 10:34.634
Don't tell me. Tell Mina.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.721
It still won't open.

10:38.804 --> 10:40.681
I'm stuck.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.642
MOTHER

10:42.725 --> 10:43.643
Mom?

10:44.226 --> 10:47.271
What? Why are you calling out of the blue?

10:48.773 --> 10:51.776
I'm in the middle of a broadcast.
I'm hanging up.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.403
What's this?

10:54.487 --> 10:58.616
Air pressure adjustment function
has just shut down.

10:58.699 --> 10:59.784
This is bad.

10:59.867 --> 11:00.951
"Wa-nin"?

11:01.035 --> 11:02.036
WILL BE SUFFOCATED

11:02.119 --> 11:04.330
Does anyone know what this means?

11:04.413 --> 11:06.290
-NO OXYGEN
-THIS IS MOM

11:06.374 --> 11:08.334
"Death by suffocation."

11:08.417 --> 11:09.543
What?

11:11.629 --> 11:13.005
I got it on!

11:13.673 --> 11:16.384
Now I can breathe the oxygen
in the space suit.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.468
What?

11:17.551 --> 11:18.552
Yikes!

11:18.636 --> 11:20.554
This is out of oxygen too!

11:20.638 --> 11:23.933
<i>I used it all up in the EVA from before!</i>

11:24.016 --> 11:26.310
Taiyou, please give me permission.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.355
The authority of a UN2 staff member
is required.

11:29.438 --> 11:30.439
But--

11:30.523 --> 11:34.151
This is bad! I'm really going to die now!

11:34.902 --> 11:35.903
FATHER

11:35.986 --> 11:37.571
Now it's Dad?

11:37.655 --> 11:40.658
Didn't I tell you not to call
in the middle of a broadcast?

11:40.741 --> 11:41.742
-NO GOOD
-STORY?

11:41.826 --> 11:42.910
I'll die?

11:42.993 --> 11:46.330
No, I won't die.
It's a story. I'm hanging up.

11:46.414 --> 11:47.957
-THIS IS MINA'S FATHER
-MINA'S MOTHER (FOR REAL)

11:48.040 --> 11:49.959
My parents are texting.

11:50.042 --> 11:52.711
In front of the entire world--
My family is disgracing itself.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.088
CHECK KASUMIGAURA OFFICE HP!

11:54.171 --> 11:56.382
"John Doe claimed responsibility"?

11:56.799 --> 11:57.800
KASUMIGAURA OFFICE

11:57.883 --> 12:00.678
Taiyou, Mina is going to die. Hurry!

12:00.761 --> 12:06.100
Personally, mixing black into white
is absolutely unforgivable.

12:06.183 --> 12:07.852
What are you talking about?

12:07.935 --> 12:10.104
I'll permit the unlocking of the limiters.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.397
However,

12:11.480 --> 12:14.316
before that, I'm going to frame-fuse
Dakky and Bright together.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.276
What?

12:15.860 --> 12:19.113
I'll allow it on the condition
that it be managed by Bright.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.448
Wait a minute!

12:20.531 --> 12:24.118
I'll never forgive
mixing white into black.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.286
Execute.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.956
Frame fusion!

12:31.375 --> 12:32.793
I'll be right back.

12:35.629 --> 12:36.755
"Incorporation"?

12:39.341 --> 12:41.510
Frame fusion!

12:41.594 --> 12:44.013
What is frame fusion?

12:44.096 --> 12:45.639
-Incorporation.
-Incorporation.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.640
SAVE HER

12:46.724 --> 12:48.142
Hurry! Hurry up and save me!

12:48.225 --> 12:51.103
<i>My follower count has grown. I'm so happy.</i>

12:51.187 --> 12:53.147
<i>Save me!</i>

12:53.230 --> 12:56.025
IT IS FUTILE TO RESIST
THE PASSAGE OF TIME

12:56.108 --> 12:57.735
Resistance is futile.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.614
Dark, you will be reassigned
under my supervision.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.746
We have incorporated into a single frame.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.665
We are, so to speak, Dark-Bright.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.544
Dark has already been unlocked
up to the C limiter.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.962
If the E limiter is unlocked,

13:17.046 --> 13:19.465
we should achieve the intelligence
to suppress the erosion.

13:19.548 --> 13:20.549
I permit it.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.593
E limiter unlocked.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.846
Dark's cognitive level
is currently surging.

13:25.930 --> 13:28.641
Now, Dark,
show us what you are capable of.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.315
All right. It looks like
we should be able to eliminate it.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.903
Something's here!

13:40.986 --> 13:43.822
How come it's eroding all the way inside?

13:43.906 --> 13:46.075
Look! It's coming in here too.

13:49.078 --> 13:50.955
In this state,
it won't have enough capacity.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.165
Unlock a higher level
of cognitive restrictions.

13:53.249 --> 13:56.043
I hate doing things like this.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.962
We need to get up to the G limiter.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.046
Permission granted.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.973
It seems the obstacle can be eliminated.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.975
Accessing the bulkhead.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.854
I thought I was a goner.

14:15.938 --> 14:19.358
I am so sorry for the trouble
my older sister has caused.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.860
Taiyou. Touya.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.654
You guys saved my life.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.031
I'll give you
5,000 Mina handshake coupons.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.366
Not necessary.

14:27.449 --> 14:28.826
Oh, yeah.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.871
I should introduce
Touya and everybody to my followers.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.205
SHOCKING! TOUYA'S TRUE COLORS

14:33.289 --> 14:34.415
Oops, forgot.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.668
I should delete that video.

14:37.751 --> 14:38.836
What?

14:39.420 --> 14:40.963
The Internet's out.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.715
Oh, no. I can't delete it.

14:47.678 --> 14:50.139
All right, just one more bulkhead.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.141
Twelve, hurry up.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.272
Twelve, what's wrong?

14:58.355 --> 15:00.357
Everyone, time's up.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.028
I will die now.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.906
-Farewell.
-Wait, Twelve.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.743
I hope I was able
to meet the expectations all of you--

15:10.826 --> 15:11.911
Twelve!

15:11.994 --> 15:15.414
Touya,
why isn't the last bulkhead opening?

15:16.582 --> 15:17.958
Twelve

15:18.709 --> 15:20.294
is dead.

15:20.377 --> 15:23.505
The squiggly wigglies are spreading again.

15:30.262 --> 15:32.097
The pattern is evolving.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.642
Stopping it here
will be the best I can do.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.851
<i>It's the UN2.</i>

15:35.935 --> 15:38.354
<i>The UN2 ship has come.</i>

15:38.437 --> 15:39.521
We're saved!

15:39.605 --> 15:42.274
The UN2 rescue ship has come, everybody.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.110
What a relief! UN2!

15:45.194 --> 15:46.862
UN2!

15:48.155 --> 15:49.073
ATTACK VESSEL 94%

15:49.156 --> 15:50.449
An attack vessel?

15:51.075 --> 15:52.910
Why aren't the comms back?

15:52.993 --> 15:56.830
I don't know, but text-only communication
is just barely possible.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.082
I'll read it.

15:58.582 --> 16:02.836
"Because this station
could potentially trigger a pandemic,

16:02.920 --> 16:04.338
we are sealing it off."

16:04.421 --> 16:05.839
That's not a rescue ship.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.716
It's an attack vessel.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.094
UN2. No.

16:10.177 --> 16:13.555
Why are they doing this? Because
I unlocked the cognitive restrictions?

16:13.639 --> 16:15.057
A pandemic?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.059
-Like a disease?
-It's probably that.

16:17.643 --> 16:21.063
They're afraid that it will spread
outside of the station.

16:22.147 --> 16:26.068
But this is just the time
to ride this big wave.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.780
-UN2, Please!
-Here's the recap up to this point.

16:29.863 --> 16:33.409
A comet hit us. We are trapped.
The guy has **** lost it!

16:33.492 --> 16:37.037
A creepy pattern is eroding the place,
and UN2 is not going to save us!

16:37.121 --> 16:39.581
In a single word, it is chaos!

16:39.665 --> 16:41.083
On the scene and signing off.

16:41.166 --> 16:44.294
UN2 is the one blocking the comms?

16:44.795 --> 16:46.672
Do they intend to abandon the children?

16:46.755 --> 16:48.841
They're saying the pattern
on the Anshin's surface

16:48.924 --> 16:52.678
matches the forbidden "S" Pattern.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.472
"S" Pattern? What does that mean?

16:56.056 --> 16:59.101
The "S" Pattern
is a dangerous quantum circuit

16:59.184 --> 17:01.979
that transcended human technology
and self-propagates.

17:03.480 --> 17:05.399
Self-propagates? Impossible.

17:05.482 --> 17:08.569
There's an even bigger one over there.

17:09.486 --> 17:10.404
DELICIOUS COMET WATER

17:10.487 --> 17:12.281
The system that restores the comet

17:12.364 --> 17:16.160
was a product designed by Seven
right before it was euthanized.

17:16.744 --> 17:18.746
It was made with the "S" Pattern.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.666
It's finally begun.
The final chapter of the poem.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.170
<i>I'll read it.</i>
<i>"Since the Lunatic Seven incident,</i>

17:26.253 --> 17:29.089
<i>all 'S' Patterns were supposed</i>
<i>to have been destroyed.</i>

17:29.173 --> 17:31.800
<i>However, part of it</i>
<i>somehow eluded surveillance."</i>

17:32.634 --> 17:35.304
Yes, Konoha's
and the others' implants too.

17:36.138 --> 17:39.641
<i>"Now all existing 'S' Patterns</i>
<i>around the world</i>

17:39.725 --> 17:41.226
<i>are on the comet and on this station.</i>

17:41.310 --> 17:42.311
S PATTERN - JOHN DOE

17:42.394 --> 17:43.812
<i>This is too unnatural.</i>

17:44.480 --> 17:46.774
<i>This is part of</i>
<i>an intentional act of terrorism.</i>

17:47.566 --> 17:51.236
We believe that a collaborator
is inside the Anshin.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.782
<i>Earlier,</i>
<i>someone from John Doe made a statement</i>

17:54.865 --> 17:57.201
<i>claiming responsibility for the offense."</i>

17:57.785 --> 17:59.328
A statement from John Doe?

17:59.411 --> 18:02.831
Oh, that thing from before
that I read by chance.

18:03.415 --> 18:07.086
"The White House, Shenzhen,
the Kremlin, Kasumigaura and the like,

18:07.169 --> 18:09.213
all of their home pages
are being rewritten."

18:09.296 --> 18:13.300
They're confusing
Kasumigaura and Kasumigaseki again.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.636
One third of humankind--

18:15.719 --> 18:17.721
I've heard that somewhere.

18:18.388 --> 18:21.225
But how could they do something
so terrible?

18:22.434 --> 18:24.728
It's the main body of the comet.

18:25.187 --> 18:28.148
They plan on hitting Earth with the comet.

18:29.817 --> 18:33.445
In one hour, the planet will take
a direct hit from the comet.

18:33.529 --> 18:36.740
This is the mass of the main body,
as analyzed by the UN2.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.743
If something like this hits Earth--

18:44.331 --> 18:51.213
It coincides perfectly with Seven's plan
to exterminate 36.79% of humanity.

18:52.297 --> 18:54.591
We've determined
what type of attack vessel it is.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.094
It's compatible with nuclear weapons.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.639
They think that we're part of John Doe.

19:01.181 --> 19:02.099
OPTICAL

19:02.182 --> 19:05.102
Is the UN2 planning a nuclear strike
on us as well?

19:05.185 --> 19:07.187
I won't allow it.

19:07.271 --> 19:08.272
Think.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.030
The pattern's intelligence
is also surging.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.324
Unlock the J limiter.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.409
Permission granted.

19:22.411 --> 19:23.412
It's still not enough.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.914
Granted. Full permissions granted.

19:25.998 --> 19:30.878
Taiyou, with your authority,
I can only unlock up to the L limiter.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.798
Then grant permission up to the L limiter.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.177
It seems the erosion has stopped.

19:39.469 --> 19:44.183
Somehow the quantum circuit was completed,
so it seems the growth phase has ended.

19:44.766 --> 19:47.394
I've got to think
even more outside the box.

19:48.937 --> 19:52.065
The comet is just 20,000 kilometers away.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.859
If a nuclear explosion occurs here,

19:53.942 --> 19:57.196
the rescue ship that's supposed to come
before it enters the atmosphere

19:57.279 --> 20:00.616
will also be completely inoperable due to
the electromagnetic waves from the EMPs.

20:01.200 --> 20:05.287
If we don't stop UN2 from
a nuclear strike, we'll all be Buddhas.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.664
There's one way to stop them.

20:07.748 --> 20:10.000
Eliminate the threat of the comet.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.126
How?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.545
Stop the collision with Earth.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.340
And how will we do that?

20:16.423 --> 20:18.717
Convince it not to?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.387
That's right.

20:22.471 --> 20:26.433
The water company would have been prepared
to correct a deviation from orbit.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.603
I see. Getting the materials now.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.106
<i>Can we communicate with the comet</i>
<i>using these materials?</i>

20:33.857 --> 20:36.235
"Yes," Dark says.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.071
<i>If this is John Doe terrorism,</i>

20:39.154 --> 20:42.574
<i>they surely hacked the comet's</i>
<i>orbit-correcting function.</i>

20:42.658 --> 20:46.495
I see. If I can re-hack the main body
with Dark-Bright,

20:46.578 --> 20:47.996
we can change the orbit.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.875
<i>But all comm functions are unusable.</i>

20:51.959 --> 20:52.960
<i>Why?</i>

20:53.043 --> 20:57.798
<i>All UN2-approved communication</i>
<i>devices can be shut down remotely.</i>

20:57.881 --> 21:01.009
Damn it! Isn't there any way?

21:01.093 --> 21:04.596
There has to be a communication device
that isn't UN2-approved.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.889
CAN BE USED

21:05.973 --> 21:08.642
Kibo's ICS antenna.

21:08.725 --> 21:09.726
What is it?

21:09.810 --> 21:13.272
The antenna that's attached
to the Japanese Module Kibo.

21:13.355 --> 21:15.440
It was purchased from ISS
for tourism purposes.

21:15.524 --> 21:19.319
But that's an old antique
that was about to be discarded.

21:19.403 --> 21:23.323
There's no way it could reach a distance
of 20,000 km with this jamming signal.

21:23.407 --> 21:27.077
Would it make it
if it was 60 meters ahead?

21:27.828 --> 21:30.038
It seems Dark has thought of something.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.833
Please connect me to the ICS antenna.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.127
Touya, here's a cable.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.088
What in the world
is that drone planning to do?

21:38.171 --> 21:40.340
I don't know either.

21:41.174 --> 21:44.136
According to Dark,
the "S" Pattern and comet

21:44.219 --> 21:47.306
can communicate with each other
inside of the jamming signal

21:47.389 --> 21:49.725
since they're using quantum communication.

21:49.808 --> 21:52.894
Question! What is quantum communication?

21:52.978 --> 21:57.524
Completely confidential communication tech
established by unknown Seven technology.

21:57.607 --> 21:58.984
It breaks the Shannon limit

21:59.067 --> 22:01.778
with its encryption protocol
utilizing entanglement--

22:01.862 --> 22:03.947
Got it. That's enough.

22:04.031 --> 22:07.451
Anyhow, that means it can communicate
by mysterious means, right?

22:08.452 --> 22:12.164
We will interrupt this communication
circuit with the ICS antenna.

22:12.247 --> 22:14.207
It seems Dark has invented technology

22:14.291 --> 22:16.835
that can run a quantum communication
on radio waves.

22:17.627 --> 22:19.838
Dark has already used this circuit

22:19.921 --> 22:22.966
and connected with the comet once.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.892
Dark has connected with the comet.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.227
However,

22:34.853 --> 22:37.898
although we can connect,
it is using an unknown barrier.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.942
An unknown barrier?

22:41.026 --> 22:44.780
The comet's intelligence
has grown beyond prediction.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.282
It has reached 80% of Seven's.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.494
Are you okay?

22:50.994 --> 22:56.374
I heard this voice before
when I was much younger.

22:57.751 --> 23:02.506
<i>Dark says that this barrier</i>
<i>is the same as Seven's.</i>

23:02.589 --> 23:03.673
<i>It is impregnable.</i>

23:04.299 --> 23:06.218
The same as Seven's?

23:06.301 --> 23:07.719
I remember.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.806
The "S" in the "S" Pattern
is the "S" in Seven.

23:11.640 --> 23:15.519
<i>Seven itself</i>
<i>was made from the "S" Pattern.</i>

23:15.602 --> 23:17.062
Then this comet…

23:18.105 --> 23:20.315
is Seven itself resurrected?

23:20.941 --> 23:25.695
"Seven shall become a comet
bearing blessings and be resurrected."

23:25.779 --> 23:26.613
COMET

23:26.696 --> 23:27.697
Just like the poem says.

23:28.281 --> 23:29.574
<i>Dakky, anything yet?</i>

23:30.033 --> 23:33.245
<i>No. Hacking isn't working.</i>

23:33.328 --> 23:37.958
<i>That's crazy. Then how on earth did</i>
<i>John Doe manage to change the orbit?</i>

23:38.041 --> 23:42.420
The comet's AI is thinking autonomously
and determining the trajectory.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.966
It is using the data from John Doe
and thinking independently.

23:46.049 --> 23:49.261
<i>As a result,</i>
<i>it selected collision with the Earth.</i>

23:49.761 --> 23:52.222
So what are we supposed to do?

23:52.305 --> 23:55.225
We will talk to it and persuade it.

23:55.308 --> 23:56.977
Something's happening
on the comet's surface.

23:57.978 --> 24:03.024
The comet's intelligence…
has now surpassed Seven's.

24:04.234 --> 24:07.487
-It surpassed…
-Seven?

24:08.071 --> 24:10.407
It's Lunatic. This is the end.

24:10.490 --> 24:14.119
There's no way we can persuade
a collapsed intelligence.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.872
Communications are still connected.

24:17.539 --> 24:19.624
Identifying language system.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.585
Language identified.

24:21.668 --> 24:23.378
Learning grammar.

24:26.006 --> 24:27.465
A response has come.

24:28.091 --> 24:31.386
We can speak,
though not in a human language.

24:32.053 --> 24:33.263
We did it.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.309
We can talk to a Lunatic AI.

24:37.392 --> 24:41.021
Then perhaps to the implants as well.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.647
Time's up.

24:43.148 --> 24:46.359
They just launched a nuclear weapon
at the comet.

24:48.111 --> 24:53.283
The Anshin and much of the Earth
are going to take a serious EMP hit.

24:54.034 --> 24:57.454
When that happens,
there will be no hope of a rescue.

24:58.455 --> 25:02.167
-How many minutes left?
-Twenty seconds.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.501
Twenty seconds?

25:03.585 --> 25:07.130
<i>Damn it! There's no time to evacuate.</i>

25:07.214 --> 25:11.343
The comet has detected the nuclear strike
and is doing something.

25:12.802 --> 25:13.929
Ten seconds.

25:16.514 --> 25:20.143
It's okay.
You can see that, can't you, Konoha?

25:21.394 --> 25:22.437
Nasa.

25:26.900 --> 25:29.569
Nasa, are you--

25:31.404 --> 25:32.405
Three,

25:32.489 --> 25:33.782
two,

25:33.865 --> 25:34.991
one.

25:40.664 --> 25:42.290
What happened?

25:42.999 --> 25:44.918
I'm not dead yet?

25:45.877 --> 25:48.296
-What about the EMP?
-I can't see it.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.466
<i>Electrical components operating normally.</i>

25:51.549 --> 25:53.385
Did the nuclear strike fail?

25:54.386 --> 25:56.680
<i>This is an optical telescope image.</i>

25:57.264 --> 26:01.559
According to Dark, the comet hacked
the nuclear weapon and shut it down.

26:02.143 --> 26:05.146
It hacked UN2's nuclear weapon?

26:05.230 --> 26:07.274
There's no way it can do that.

26:07.357 --> 26:11.444
It seems the comet received
a hacking method from somebody.

26:11.528 --> 26:12.696
What?

26:12.779 --> 26:14.739
The comet is in great shape.

26:14.823 --> 26:17.450
Now Dark is using
11th dimension wave function

26:17.534 --> 26:20.328
to have a heated debate
with the comet's AI.

26:20.829 --> 26:23.456
It is too advanced
for me to understand, but--

26:24.040 --> 26:26.918
"Many humans will die
if you collide with Earth.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.296
I don't want you to kill the humans."

26:29.379 --> 26:32.465
Do you think it's possible to persuade it
to change its trajectory?

26:33.049 --> 26:37.470
It seems that the comet is not able
to comprehend the concept of humans.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.809
Interestingly,
it has a proper concept of humanity.

26:42.892 --> 26:47.814
But it seems to believe that "humanity"
and "humans" are separate creatures.

26:47.897 --> 26:49.983
Separate creatures?

26:50.066 --> 26:53.028
While the comet puts the highest priority
on humanity,

26:53.111 --> 26:56.489
"humans" outside of that frame
are not given priority.

26:56.573 --> 27:01.202
Thus the comet thought that 36.79%
of the unimportant humans

27:01.286 --> 27:03.747
should be exterminated.

27:03.830 --> 27:05.248
Seven probably does as well.

27:05.332 --> 27:07.083
Do you foresee us persuading it?

27:07.167 --> 27:11.379
<i>Dark is currently in the process,</i>
<i>but isn't quite getting the point across.</i>

27:11.963 --> 27:15.133
However, the comet is incredibly curious.

27:15.216 --> 27:18.345
Dark guesses that if we gave it
a chance to learn about humans,

27:18.428 --> 27:21.931
it may be possible to persuade it
to change its trajectory.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.434
Okay, carry on.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.019
Aye. Copy.

27:26.102 --> 27:28.938
I believe that we will succeed
in persuading it soon--

27:33.860 --> 27:35.820
What are you doing, Nasa?

27:39.449 --> 27:41.743
Your attention, everyone.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.453
To tell the truth,

27:43.536 --> 27:46.998
I'm the one who taught it about
the security hole in the nuclear weapon.

27:47.582 --> 27:48.625
What?

27:48.708 --> 27:53.630
Yes, and we must have the comet
stay the course and collide.

27:53.713 --> 27:56.633
This is stated in the <i>Seven Poem</i>.

27:57.425 --> 28:00.512
Nasa, what are you saying?

28:01.137 --> 28:04.557
Ta-da! Now I shall reveal my true self.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.018
I am a member of John Doe.

28:07.102 --> 28:10.146
You were the terrorist?

28:10.230 --> 28:12.982
It's not terrorism. This is a revolution.

28:13.566 --> 28:15.985
This is to save humanity.

28:16.069 --> 28:17.779
Ouch!

29:42.447 --> 29:45.867
