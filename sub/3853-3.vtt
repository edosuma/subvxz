[narrator]
previously on dark matter.

00:01.580 --> 00:03.158
[one]
we all woke up just like you,

00:03.159 --> 00:04.737
No idea who we are
or how we got here.

00:04.739 --> 00:07.439
We've named ourselves
by the order we woke up in.

00:07.441 --> 00:08.240
I'm one.

00:08.242 --> 00:08.808
Two.

00:08.809 --> 00:09.375
Three.

00:09.377 --> 00:10.275
Four.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.610
Five.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.545
Which makes you, six.

00:13.547 --> 00:17.149
[android]
murder, assault, arson, theft, .

00:17.151 --> 00:20.252
Turns out the raza aren't a rac.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.122
The raza is the name of this sh.

00:23.124 --> 00:26.291
We're not here to help these pe,
we're here to kill them.

00:26.293 --> 00:27.626
We had a deal.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.028
I got a better offer.

00:33.434 --> 00:34.666
[android]
good morning everyone.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.635
Here is your report from the br.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.605
I hope you're all
enjoying a hearty breakfast.

00:39.607 --> 00:42.408
The ship's engines are operating
within acceptable parameters.

00:42.410 --> 00:44.710
At current rate of travel
we should be arriving

00:44.712 --> 00:48.380
At the space station in
approximately 26 hours and 7 se.

00:48.382 --> 00:50.416
Exactly one hour earlier
than the last time

00:50.418 --> 00:54.286
She updated us, one hour ago.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.188
Thank you robot.

00:56.190 --> 00:58.757
[three] so, here's what happens
when we hit the space station.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.326
Hawk the ship,
split the profits,

01:01.328 --> 01:05.531
Have a fond farewell toast--
bid each other adieu.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.271
No?

01:12.273 --> 01:14.206
[one]
you want to split up?

01:14.208 --> 01:16.175
Yeah, we're six strangers
and a robot.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.110
We don't owe
each other anything.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.245
But we're a team.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.381
No offense,
but this "team"

01:22.383 --> 01:24.349
Has a lot of dead
weight on it.

01:24.351 --> 01:25.551
[six]
offense taken.

01:27.321 --> 01:31.457
Once we get to the station
we're gonna  refuel, resupply, .

01:31.459 --> 01:33.358
I'd be happy to give anyone
who wants to leave their share

01:33.360 --> 01:36.829
Of whatever we have left,
but we're not selling the ship.

01:39.700 --> 01:40.549
[door whooshes open and closed]

01:40.550 --> 01:41.399
Ain't up to her.

01:42.636 --> 01:45.104
I don't want to sell the ship.

01:45.106 --> 01:46.171
Me neither.

01:49.176 --> 01:50.109
Me neither.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.180
Okay, yeah.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.782
Alright.

01:56.784 --> 01:59.785
[door whooshes open and closed]

01:59.787 --> 02:01.553
You know,
if we just stick together--

02:01.555 --> 02:03.489
[four slams silverware down]

02:06.193 --> 02:07.292
Fine.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.627
That's fine.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.162
[door whooshes open and closed]

02:10.164 --> 02:11.797
This is what i wanted anyway.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.566
A little peace and quiet.

02:14.568 --> 02:20.506
[silence]

02:20.508 --> 02:26.545
[keyboard keys pressing down]

02:26.547 --> 02:28.514
You wanna play
a game or something?

02:28.516 --> 02:30.449
[six sighs] nah,
i'm just gonna take a nap.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.288
No thanks, kiddo.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.156
I found this antique book
in one of the holding rooms.

02:38.159 --> 02:41.160
It says it's a classic,
so i'm sure i've read it before,

02:41.162 --> 02:43.328
But it's all new to me now.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.498
I can give it to you
when i'm done if you wa--

02:46.500 --> 02:48.600
Or not.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.638
Hey!

02:52.640 --> 02:55.707
[door slams shut]

03:08.923 --> 03:10.522
[five sighs]

03:25.206 --> 03:26.939
[hatchdoor squeaks opens]

04:51.525 --> 04:53.458
[started gasp]

¶ music playing ¶

05:08.809 --> 05:13.011
[electronic buzzing]

05:13.013 --> 05:16.448
[android] male, appears
to be in his mid-teens.

05:16.450 --> 05:19.818
Didn't need to break out
the fancy scanners to tell us t.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.987
How long has he been dead?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.522
A while.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.891
[once] shouldn't he have started
to decompose by now?

05:25.893 --> 05:28.627
Under normal circumstances yes,
but the temperature

05:28.629 --> 05:31.530
In that section of the ship
was significantly lowered.

05:31.532 --> 05:33.799
As a result, the body
was quite well preserved.

05:33.801 --> 05:36.101
What were you doing up
in those vents anyways?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.869
[five stuttering]
exploring.

05:37.871 --> 05:39.371
You shouldn't
be up there at all.

05:39.373 --> 05:40.906
It's dangerous.

05:40.908 --> 05:43.875
Not anymore dangerous
than the rest of this ship.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.477
Any idea what
happened to him?

05:45.479 --> 05:47.112
He was shot.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.081
A single bullet to the kidney.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.983
He bled to death.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.454
Who was he, why the hell
did he bleed out on our ship?

05:55.456 --> 05:56.955
That the scanner can't tell us.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.957
Is there any record
of another crew member

05:58.959 --> 06:00.058
In the ship's computer?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.693
None that i found.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.462
You mean
one of us killed him

06:03.464 --> 06:05.030
And stuffed him
in that utility room?

06:05.032 --> 06:06.998
There's no point
in speculating.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.969
Without our memories,
we'll probably never know.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.988
Check the
body for valuables.

06:12.989 --> 06:15.006
We'll jettison it the next
time we drop out of ftl.

06:15.008 --> 06:15.941
That's it?

06:15.943 --> 06:17.259
What?

06:17.260 --> 06:18.576
Did you want to
organize a funeral?

06:18.579 --> 06:19.978
Prepare parting remarks?

06:19.980 --> 06:23.482
I think it'd be a bad idea
to dock at the space station

06:23.484 --> 06:24.983
With a dead body
on board.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.052
One of us killed him,
that doesn't bother you?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.887
Almost everything
about this bothers me,

06:28.889 --> 06:31.156
But pointing fingers isn't
going to get us anywhere.

06:31.158 --> 06:32.023
Let's just--

06:33.861 --> 06:37.763
Lets just forget about this
and put it behind us, alright?

06:37.765 --> 06:39.164
Come on.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.473
¶ door slides open ¶

06:48.475 --> 06:50.475
¶ door slides closed ¶

06:50.477 --> 06:52.477
I need you to do
something for me.

06:52.479 --> 06:53.845
Of course, two.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.515
And i'm going need you
to keep quiet about it.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.055
[staff whirling through air]

07:04.057 --> 07:05.991
[three]
hey, you busy?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.962
Listen, i need you
to help swing the vote.

07:10.964 --> 07:14.032
Get the others to sell
the ship so we can all cash out.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.568
What makes you think
i wanna do that?

07:16.570 --> 07:18.837
Well because selling this ship
allows us the freedom

07:18.839 --> 07:19.905
To chart our own course--

07:19.907 --> 07:21.573
Woah!

07:21.575 --> 07:23.825
Call our own shots.

07:23.826 --> 07:26.076
[three] come on man, instead of
letting these losers decide for,

07:26.079 --> 07:28.113
Let's cut 'em loose!

07:28.115 --> 07:29.614
[four] it's too soon.

07:29.616 --> 07:31.650
What are you talking about?

07:31.651 --> 07:33.685
We don't know enough about
who we are, who they are.

07:33.687 --> 07:35.987
The person i was
chose to be on this ship.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.457
He must have had a reason.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.926
You don't know that you
even chose to be on this ship.

07:40.928 --> 07:43.495
The clearest path
hasn't presented itself yet.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.465
And until it does, i stay.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.568
Alright, have a good time
playing with your stick.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.803
But if the day should come
where i'm no longer pleased

07:51.805 --> 07:53.872
With this arrangement--

07:53.874 --> 07:55.941
Yeah?

07:55.943 --> 07:58.577
Even then i wouldn't sell the s,

07:58.579 --> 08:00.645
I'd take it for myself.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.703
I feel bad for him.

08:26.173 --> 08:29.708
The time for feeling
bad for him is long past.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.977
He's gone.

08:31.979 --> 08:37.148
I know, it's just... The thought
of dying in some dark room,

08:37.150 --> 08:39.618
Bleeding and alone.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.685
He was around my age.

08:40.687 --> 08:43.054
I probably knew him.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.190
Maybe.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.291
And maybe not.

08:46.293 --> 08:51.029
When i was in that vent,
i could've just passed right by,

08:51.031 --> 08:54.199
But something told me
to stop and look in that room.

08:54.201 --> 08:55.967
It was like i'd been there befo,

08:55.969 --> 08:59.037
Like i knew there
was something to find.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.805
[frustrated sigh]

09:00.807 --> 09:04.276
I knew he was there,
which means i knew him.

09:04.278 --> 09:06.077
He probably meant
something to me once.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.879
And now, he's just
some dead stranger.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.649
It's not right.

09:10.651 --> 09:14.719
I just wish i could remember.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.856
Well, the more i think about it,

09:17.858 --> 09:21.226
The more i believe we're betterf
not remembering any of it.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.260
Really?

09:22.262 --> 09:23.929
Yeah.

09:23.931 --> 09:25.830
Fresh starts
for all of us, right?

09:28.001 --> 09:30.669
What if--

09:30.671 --> 09:32.737
Yeah?

09:32.739 --> 09:35.774
What if some of
our memories were--

09:35.776 --> 09:37.842
What if they
weren't all gone?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.115
[five]
don't! Please!

09:46.119 --> 09:47.052
[six] she has all our
memories in her head?!

09:47.054 --> 09:49.187
And you knew it?!

09:49.189 --> 09:50.755
I knew that's
what she thought.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.823
And you told her to
stay quiet about it?

09:51.825 --> 09:52.791
Why?

09:52.793 --> 09:53.858
I wanted to make sure.

09:53.860 --> 09:54.926
Yeah?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.962
How'd you
plan on doing that?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.333
She's been having dreams.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.168
Dreams she thinks
might be memories,

10:03.170 --> 10:05.837
Except they're not just hers.

10:05.839 --> 10:07.072
What?

10:07.074 --> 10:09.074
I think all of our
memories may have somehow

10:09.076 --> 10:12.811
Been transferred
into her subconscious.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.879
How's that even possible?

10:14.881 --> 10:16.348
[six] how's any
of this possible?

10:16.350 --> 10:17.983
[two] there's something else.

10:17.985 --> 10:20.752
One of the dreams
she experienced was of one of us

10:20.754 --> 10:23.021
Sabotaging the stasis pods.

10:23.023 --> 10:24.255
Son of a bitch.

10:24.257 --> 10:26.241
[one]
hang on.

10:26.242 --> 10:28.226
Just because she dreamed it,
doesn't make it real.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.794
I had the android search
through all terminal activity

10:29.796 --> 10:31.830
Prior to our last deep sleep.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.415
And?!

10:33.416 --> 10:34.999
I recovered portions of
a self-deleted subroutine

10:35.002 --> 10:38.036
That was initiated prior
to all of you entering stasis.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.938
Although it's specific intent i,

10:39.940 --> 10:42.007
It would appear your
memories were targeted.

10:46.780 --> 10:50.081
Oh, come on guys.

10:50.083 --> 10:50.982
How hard can this be?

10:50.984 --> 10:51.950
The kid remembers doing it.

10:51.952 --> 10:53.018
She did it!

10:53.019 --> 10:54.085
[six] if it was her,
why would she tell us about it?

10:54.086 --> 10:55.152
Think about it.

10:55.153 --> 10:56.219
[two] alright, alright, come on.

10:56.223 --> 10:59.257
Why didn't you tell
us about this sooner?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.759
I wanted to see if
her dream about tampering

11:00.761 --> 11:03.828
With the ship's
systems checked out.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.865
It did, which means this goes
far beyond that one memory.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.433
She could have
all of our memories

11:08.435 --> 11:09.968
Tucked away in her head.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.822
When you dream,

11:13.823 --> 11:15.840
You have no idea whose
memories you're experiencing?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.175
No.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.911
In the dreams,
everything is happening to me,

11:19.913 --> 11:24.082
But sometimes
i can tell i'm not me.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.851
It's really confusing,
and a lot of times kinda hazy.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.220
I have trouble
remembering it when i wake up.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.825
So someone in this room
wiped our memories

11:33.827 --> 11:35.960
And probably killed that kid.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.434
[power system failing]

11:43.904 --> 11:46.905

11:46.907 --> 11:47.673
[alarm beeping]

11:47.674 --> 11:48.440
[two]
what was that?

11:48.442 --> 11:50.175
We just
dropped out of ftl.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.043
Why?

11:52.045 --> 11:53.344
There's something
wrong with the ship.

11:53.346 --> 11:58.750
[alarm continues]

12:03.824 --> 12:05.423
[android] we've lost power
to several systems,

12:05.425 --> 12:07.292
Including external
sensors and the ftl drive.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.827
What happened?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.495
The operation efficiency
of one of the outer relays

12:10.497 --> 12:12.030
Dropped below minimum safe.

12:12.032 --> 12:14.032
The ship detached
the coupling and shut down

12:14.034 --> 12:16.968
All related systems to
avoid a catastrophic failure.

12:16.970 --> 12:18.136
Translation please?

12:18.138 --> 12:19.771
We nearly blew a fuse.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.372
Except in this case,
"blowing a fuse"

12:21.374 --> 12:23.374
Would equate to
an explosion powerful enough

12:23.376 --> 12:25.076
To vaporize the entire ship.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.980
Well, that's great.

12:28.982 --> 12:31.750
Dead bodies,
hacked stasis pods, now this.

12:31.752 --> 12:34.252
It's a whole lotta things
going wrong on this ship.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.855
Almost like someone's
been tampering with it,

12:36.857 --> 12:38.189
Isn't that right tech monkey?

12:38.859 --> 12:40.258
Back off.

12:40.260 --> 12:41.526
Why are you protecting her?

12:41.528 --> 12:43.645
You don't know her.

12:43.646 --> 12:45.763
I know i like her a lot
more than i like you.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.465
Could this be sabotage?

12:47.467 --> 12:48.767
[android] the coupling
is located on the outer hull.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.401
If someone wanted
to tamper with it,

12:50.403 --> 12:52.771
They would have had
to perform an eva.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.039
You mean go
outside the ship?

12:55.041 --> 12:56.074
It seems unlikely.

12:56.076 --> 12:57.308
[two] no, it's impossible.

12:57.310 --> 12:59.477
We were in ftl
until five minutes ago.

12:59.479 --> 13:00.411
Exactly.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.449
On the other hand, tampering
with the diagnostic system

13:04.451 --> 13:07.152
To make the ship think
that the coupling would fail

13:07.154 --> 13:08.386
Would be
comparatively simple.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.455
If someone wanted
to disable the ship

13:10.457 --> 13:13.525
Without doing any real damage,
this would be an excellent way .

13:16.930 --> 13:19.230
Well, we can't stay
out here forever.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.232
How do we get
the ftl back online?

13:21.234 --> 13:23.268
First, i have to
determine what, if anything,

13:23.270 --> 13:24.569
Is wrong with the system.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.871
That could take some time.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.506
We'll let you get to it then.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.548
Do you have
another question?

13:36.550 --> 13:37.982
Yeah.

13:37.984 --> 13:41.052
When people lie,
they exhibit tells, right?

13:41.054 --> 13:43.588
Physical signs that
they're being untruthful.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.490
When humans
are being deceptive,

13:45.492 --> 13:49.327
They show a spike
in respiration, blood pressure,

13:49.329 --> 13:50.995
And changes
in skin conductivity.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.498
Now those signs,
we wouldn't necessarily be able

13:53.500 --> 13:56.201
To notice them,
but you could, right?

13:56.203 --> 13:59.170
If i was in close
enough proximity, yes.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.005
In theory, i could determine
if a person was lying.

14:05.412 --> 14:06.477
[four]
where are we going?

14:06.479 --> 14:08.229
[three]
you'll see.

14:08.230 --> 14:09.980
[four] you said you wanted
to show me something.

14:09.983 --> 14:10.882
[three]
i do.

14:10.884 --> 14:13.351
Just trust me on this one.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.220
You are going to be amazed.

14:20.594 --> 14:21.926
That's it?

14:21.928 --> 14:23.394
Yeah.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.164
You expect me to be amazed
by a very large door?

14:26.166 --> 14:28.166
No, not the door,
what's behind the door.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.200
What's behind the door?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.134
I don't know.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.281
Yet.

14:32.282 --> 14:34.427
But it's got to
be pretty awesome,

14:34.428 --> 14:36.573
I mean why else keep it
behind this kind of lockdown?

14:36.576 --> 14:38.076
No one else
knows about this?

14:38.078 --> 14:41.546
Nope, only you, because
you're the only guy i trust.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.584
Oh hey,
i've been thinking.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.053
The way you handle your weapons
it's damn impressive.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.221
It's mighty
damn impressive

14:50.223 --> 14:53.491
For someone
who's lost their memories.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.492
Don't get me wrong.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.327
I'm not accusing
you of anything.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.329
Just wondering
how you do it is all.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.598
I mean you can't even
remember your own name,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.500
Yet you recall all
these fancy moves?

15:03.970 --> 15:04.535
Hmm?

15:10.076 --> 15:11.109
Instinct.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.682
Okay, instinct.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.053
So what are your
instincts telling you about

15:22.055 --> 15:25.189
Whether or not you
can open this door?

15:30.096 --> 15:32.096
Remember, we're partners
in this, yeah.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.998
I've got your back;
you've got mine.

15:38.004 --> 15:40.071
So, you think
you can open this door?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.276
No.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.482
Well, shit.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.390
[six]
hey.

16:02.462 --> 16:03.428
[two]
what?

16:03.430 --> 16:04.562
We need to talk.

16:04.564 --> 16:05.363
About what?

16:05.365 --> 16:07.365
The kid.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.700
You mean five.

16:08.702 --> 16:11.102
She doesn't belong here.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.971
A while ago,
you were arguing otherwise.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.039
That was before
she found that body.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.708
We're bad company.

16:16.710 --> 16:20.178
I know, but she woke up in that
stasis pod like everybody else,

16:20.180 --> 16:25.183
And that tells me she did
something right, or wrong, to b.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.451
Is that what you believe?

16:26.453 --> 16:28.219
Or is it what you've
convinced yourself,

16:28.221 --> 16:30.221
So you can keep
her around long enough

16:30.223 --> 16:32.090
To tap those
memories in her head?

16:33.526 --> 16:34.642
[one]
hey.

16:34.643 --> 16:35.759
We're convening
in the mess hall.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.195
What for?

16:37.197 --> 16:38.763
Answers.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.037
I'll begin by asking
some simple questions

16:46.039 --> 16:48.339
To establish
a vitals baseline.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.074
Sure thing.

16:50.076 --> 16:51.409
What is your name?

16:51.411 --> 16:53.144
Jace corso.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.747
Well at least that's
what the records tell me.

16:55.749 --> 16:57.648
Here they call me one.

16:57.650 --> 17:01.052
Well, griffin jones
was my name; i'm now six.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.387
Two.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.122
My name is two.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.456
What day is today?

17:05.458 --> 17:06.691
I have no idea.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.027
I don't know;
don't really care.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.330
It's chocolate
protein pudding day!

17:12.332 --> 17:13.464
Where are you?

17:13.466 --> 17:15.800
Sitting here talking to you.

17:15.802 --> 17:17.635
In the mess hall.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.803
Where is that?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.338
This ship, the raza.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.373
Do you have any
memory of your life

17:22.375 --> 17:24.709
Before exiting
the stasis pod five days ago?

17:24.711 --> 17:25.777
No.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.045
None.

17:27.047 --> 17:28.046
No.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.080
No.

17:29.082 --> 17:30.882
No.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.683
Do you have any memory of
tampering with the stasis pods?

17:32.685 --> 17:33.785
No.

17:33.787 --> 17:34.685
No.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.720
No.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.522
None.

17:37.524 --> 17:41.259
Well i had a dream about it,
but besides that no.

17:41.261 --> 17:42.827
Do you mean any
of the passengers

17:42.829 --> 17:44.429
On this ship any harm?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.296
No.

17:45.532 --> 17:46.497
No.

17:46.499 --> 17:47.365
No.

17:47.367 --> 17:47.799
No.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.069
Not yet.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.303
Have you sabotaged
this ship in anyway?

17:52.305 --> 17:53.604
[all]
no.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.707
Have any of the answers
you've given here today been li?

17:56.709 --> 17:59.077
No.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.679
She's telling the truth.

18:01.681 --> 18:02.713
You all are.

18:03.850 --> 18:04.849
We're not done.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.186
[three cocks gun]

18:08.188 --> 18:09.587
Not interested.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.588
Thanks, though.

18:10.590 --> 18:11.589
[two]
we all did it.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.336
Good for you.

18:13.337 --> 18:15.082
[six] why... You have
something to hide?

18:15.083 --> 18:16.828
Nope, i've told you
everything i know.

18:16.830 --> 18:20.865
Good, then this should be easy.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.767
I don't trust that robot.

18:23.336 --> 18:25.103
We're not asking.

18:27.340 --> 18:29.273
[three] this is gonna
influence the test!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.210
[android]
just try to relax.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.411
Seriously?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.746
With twitchy fingers over here?

18:35.748 --> 18:38.816
If you shoot him
you may skew the results.

18:40.120 --> 18:43.221
[three sighs in annoyance]

18:43.223 --> 18:46.057
[one uncocks gun]

18:46.058 --> 18:48.892
What is your name?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.261
Don't make this any
harder than it needs to be.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.380
I don't like to be touched.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.498
Just answer the questions
it'll be over before you know i.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.502
What is your name?

18:57.504 --> 19:00.805
From the moment i stepped out
of that pod, it's been three.

19:00.807 --> 19:02.574
What day is today?

19:02.575 --> 19:04.342
The day after yesterday
and a little before tomorrow.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.443
This is ridiculous.

19:05.445 --> 19:09.814
Do you have any memory of
tampering with the stasis pods?

19:09.816 --> 19:11.149
Of course not.

19:11.618 --> 19:12.517
There's a problem.

19:13.286 --> 19:14.418
[six cocks gun]
i knew it!

19:14.420 --> 19:16.187
I'm detecting
something unsettling.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.288
I'm not lying!

19:17.290 --> 19:18.689
Not with you.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.424
With the ship.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.727
The hull is being bombarded with
an unusually high concentration

19:22.729 --> 19:24.162
Of gamma radiation.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.533
You still think the ship
hasn't been sabotaged?

19:28.535 --> 19:29.884
What does this mean?

19:29.885 --> 19:31.234
At this current
level of exposure,

19:31.237 --> 19:33.871
Full penetration will
occur within three hours.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.873
At which point, everyone
onboard will be subjected

19:35.875 --> 19:37.942
To a lethal dose
of radiation.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.395
I thought the shields

19:57.396 --> 19:59.330
Were supposed to protect
the hull from radiation.

19:59.332 --> 20:00.631
That's exactly what
they've been doing.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.633
But this level of exposure
has taxed them

20:02.635 --> 20:04.735
Beyond design specifications.

20:04.736 --> 20:06.836
I've had to reroute power from
some of the ship's other systems

20:06.839 --> 20:08.372
To reinforce them.

20:08.374 --> 20:09.857
What caused this?

20:09.858 --> 20:11.341
[android] there are any number
of celestial phenomena

20:11.344 --> 20:13.277
That can generate
this level of gamma radiation,

20:13.279 --> 20:14.712
Even at interstellar distances.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.248
But in this case i believe
we're dealing with the remains

20:17.250 --> 20:18.916
Of a type 1-a supernova.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.820
It's unfortunate that
we happened to emerge from ftl

20:22.822 --> 20:24.722
Within lethal range.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.991
Yeah right...
This is all just bad luck?

20:26.993 --> 20:28.760
We're supposed to believe this?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.528
You think whoever sabotaged
the ship timed this malfunction

20:30.530 --> 20:32.296
Deliberately to put
us in this location?

20:32.298 --> 20:34.048
Damn straight, i do.

20:34.049 --> 20:35.799
Even though he, or she,
would suffer from the effects

20:35.802 --> 20:37.401
Like everyone else?

20:37.403 --> 20:39.437
Unless, he or she is an it.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.242
What kind of "effects"
are we talking about here?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.644
Nausea, vomiting, disorientatio-

20:46.646 --> 20:47.712
Okay.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.413
Infection, peeling skin.

20:49.415 --> 20:50.837
Okay.

20:50.838 --> 20:52.260
Hemorrhaging,
damage to the centr--

20:52.261 --> 20:53.683
Yeah, okay, okay, i get it!

20:53.686 --> 20:55.820
[three] okay, just
wait a minute here.

20:55.822 --> 20:58.322
If this is a supernova
or whatever,

20:58.324 --> 21:01.392
That mean's it's been happening
since we got here, right?

21:01.394 --> 21:02.693
So, how come
miss know-it-all

21:02.695 --> 21:04.695
Is only telling us
about it right now?

21:04.697 --> 21:06.697
I believe i may
have already mentioned

21:06.699 --> 21:08.899
That the external
sensors were down.

21:08.901 --> 21:10.851
I only detected the radiation

21:10.852 --> 21:12.802
Once it made significant
penetration into the hull.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.805
You've got an answer
for everything, don't you?

21:14.807 --> 21:17.842
Yes, i am an excellent
information source, thank you.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.260
That wasn't a compliment.

21:19.261 --> 21:20.677
[two] alright, enough.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.914
So we know the situation,
what can we do?

21:23.916 --> 21:25.449
You have two options.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.885
One, you can override
the safety protocol,

21:27.887 --> 21:29.887
And initiate
an immediate jump to ftl.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.322
[one] we can do that?

21:31.324 --> 21:32.423
[android] but, i
wouldn't advise it.

21:32.425 --> 21:33.724
[two]
why not?

21:33.726 --> 21:35.793
The system was
shut down for a reason.

21:35.795 --> 21:38.929
If we engage the coupling
without addressing the malfunct,

21:38.931 --> 21:41.432
The computer is predicting
a 73% chance of developing

21:41.434 --> 21:44.969
A fatal instability
in the plasma matrix.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.821
Translation?

21:46.822 --> 21:48.672
The ship blows up.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.575
[one] 73%? I'm not
loving those odds.

21:51.577 --> 21:55.346
Of course, if you really
believe this was sabotage,

21:55.348 --> 21:58.316
It's most likely the diagnostic
program that was tampered with,

21:58.318 --> 21:59.884
In which case
there's really nothing wrong

21:59.886 --> 22:01.385
With the coupling at all.

22:02.789 --> 22:05.022
Would anyone like
to take that chance?

22:10.830 --> 22:12.897
You said there
was a second option.

22:19.505 --> 22:21.505
[android] the computer
has identified what it believes

22:21.507 --> 22:23.040
To be the faulty part.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.510
It's a relatively
small electrical component.

22:26.512 --> 22:28.346
All we have
to do is replace it.

22:28.348 --> 22:29.881
You want one of us
to go out there?

22:29.882 --> 22:31.415
In the deadly radiation storm?

22:31.417 --> 22:32.750
Why are we even
listening to this bag of bolts?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.452
She's obviously
got a wire loose.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.621
I'll go.

22:36.622 --> 22:38.789
[three] on the other hand,
sometimes she makes a lot of se.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.924
Good luck.

22:41.794 --> 22:44.595
You're not impervious
to gamma radiation.

22:44.597 --> 22:47.465
The suits are shielded
against full spectrum em.

22:47.467 --> 22:49.767
As long as i'm not
outside for too long,

22:49.769 --> 22:50.634
I'll be fine.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.143
[six]
you okay?

22:59.145 --> 23:00.711
Yeah.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.847
I just i want to be here
in case she needs something.

23:02.849 --> 23:06.016
[power generator shutting down]

23:14.560 --> 23:16.394
It'll be okay.

23:16.396 --> 23:18.162
She'll get us all fixed up.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.699
I know.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.969
My guess is she's making it
seem a little worse than it is,

23:24.971 --> 23:28.038
That way were all impressed
when she takes care of it.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.941
I don't think
androids work that way.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.944
I know they're not supposed to,
but lets face it,

23:33.946 --> 23:36.414
Ours is a little different.

23:36.416 --> 23:37.581
[five chuckles]

23:37.583 --> 23:39.116
I know.

23:39.118 --> 23:40.918
That's why i like her.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.587
She's just
like the rest of us.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.423

23:47.160 --> 23:48.659

Good luck.

23:55.568 --> 23:57.101
I don't need it.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.803
Well, good luck anyway.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.671
No, the oxygen.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.739
I don't need it.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.576
We're draining power
from the other systems

24:05.578 --> 24:07.745
To boost the shield.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.813
I'd better hurry.

24:30.236 --> 24:33.170
[android] you should know,
i've used my neural link to upld

24:33.172 --> 24:34.972
An override program.

24:34.974 --> 24:37.041
It can be accessed
from the navigation console

24:37.043 --> 24:38.042
On the bridge.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.646
That won't be necessary.

24:42.648 --> 24:46.150
Simply initiate the override,
then after a few moments,

24:46.152 --> 24:47.618
Once complete,
it will automatically

24:47.620 --> 24:49.653
Execute the jump to ftl.

24:49.655 --> 24:50.921
We won't need it.

24:50.923 --> 24:52.690
I sincerely
hope you're right.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.258
But if anything
goes wrong out there,

24:54.260 --> 24:56.060
It will be
your only chance.

24:56.062 --> 24:59.530
You just get back in one piece,
we can't do this without you.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.265
Well, you can.

Opening outer door.

25:17.783 --> 25:20.618

are housed in a series of trencs

25:20.620 --> 25:23.087
About 50 meters
from this position.

25:23.089 --> 25:25.923
It should only take me
a few minutes to get there.

25:28.594 --> 25:29.760
Something's wrong.

and come back inside.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.012

it's an electro-static discharg.

A side effect from

25:50.249 --> 25:52.716
When the accumulation
of negative ions is too much

25:52.718 --> 25:55.319
For the hull to absorb,
they're sporadically released.

25:55.321 --> 25:58.022
[two] will your suit
insulate you if you get hit?

25:58.024 --> 25:59.089
I highly doubt it.

25:59.091 --> 26:01.025
But there's
no cause for alarm.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.159
It seems to have stopped.

26:02.161 --> 26:04.194
For now. How long
until the next one?

26:04.196 --> 26:05.863
I don't know.

26:05.865 --> 26:09.166

She'd be ripped off the hull
in a matter of nanoseconds.

that another one won't happen s.

work-around.

wrote the work-around.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.773
[android magnetic boots power d]

34:02.775 --> 34:04.374
Alright, let's go.

34:06.311 --> 34:15.318
[heavy electric magnetic boot s]

34:15.320 --> 34:18.188
[one] alright, we're
approaching the airlock.

34:18.190 --> 34:20.190
[machine whurring]

34:20.192 --> 34:21.358
Might want to hurry!

34:21.360 --> 34:22.659
Yeah.

34:23.162 --> 34:25.495
[airlock slides oepn]

34:25.497 --> 34:26.530
[electric shock]

34:26.532 --> 34:28.432
[six screaming in pain]

34:29.701 --> 34:31.802
We're in, hit it!

34:31.804 --> 34:39.109
[the raza gearing up for ftl]

34:41.613 --> 34:47.150
[five panting]

34:47.152 --> 34:47.851
[control panel beeps]

34:47.853 --> 34:49.286
[doors slide open]

34:49.288 --> 34:50.153
[five]
what's wrong?

34:50.155 --> 34:51.455
[one]
he's not breathing.

34:53.292 --> 34:54.724
I'll bring the android
back online.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.426
She'll know what to do!

34:59.598 --> 35:00.864
He doesn't have a pulse.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.432
His heart stopped!

35:03.669 --> 35:07.571
[cpr'ing six's heart]

35:08.173 --> 35:09.873
She's not waking up.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.575
Why isn't she waking up?

35:11.577 --> 35:15.645
[one panting]

35:15.647 --> 35:18.849
Agh!

35:28.694 --> 35:30.193
You can't give up.

35:31.697 --> 35:32.596
[one]
it's too late.

35:37.436 --> 35:40.737
[android reboots]

35:40.739 --> 35:41.872
Please stand back.

35:41.874 --> 35:44.141
[five and one panting]

35:52.151 --> 35:59.656
[android zapping six's heart]

35:59.658 --> 36:01.391
[six gasps for breath]

36:01.727 --> 36:03.293

are you okay?

36:05.330 --> 36:09.432
[six]
arghh!

36:09.434 --> 36:10.834
Ah!

36:10.836 --> 36:12.586
How did you do that?

36:12.587 --> 36:14.337
I released the electro-static
charge my nanites

36:14.339 --> 36:16.540
Had absorbed and stored.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.874
It was...

36:17.876 --> 36:19.476
...Very satisfying.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.582
You risked your lives to save m.

36:25.584 --> 36:26.683
I don't understand.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.553
You would've done
the same for us.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.956
In fact, i did.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.659
[six laughing]

36:35.661 --> 36:37.427
Well, thank you.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.461
You're welcome.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.799
[android] have you
sabotaged this ship in any way?

36:42.801 --> 36:43.800
[three]
no.

36:43.801 --> 36:44.800
Do you mean
any of the passengers

36:44.803 --> 36:46.469
On this ship any harm?

36:46.471 --> 36:47.871
No.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.740
Have any of the answers
you've given here today been li?

36:50.742 --> 36:51.808
No.

36:53.845 --> 36:55.845
He's telling the truth.

36:55.847 --> 36:56.880
Of course i am.

36:58.717 --> 37:00.217
Stupid.

37:00.218 --> 37:01.718
But if everyone's
telling the truth--

37:01.720 --> 37:04.854
[six] whoever did this wiped
their own memories as well.

37:04.856 --> 37:07.624
Why would anyone do that?

37:07.626 --> 37:09.459
[android] it may
have been an accident.

37:09.461 --> 37:12.696
The code was crude,
perhaps rushed.

37:12.698 --> 37:15.332
A communal mindwipe may
not have been the intention.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.700
So, what does this mean?

37:16.702 --> 37:18.702
It means that finding out
whoever did this

37:18.704 --> 37:20.937
Is gonna be
next to impossible.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.343
So, we move on?

37:27.980 --> 37:29.746
We move on.

37:32.751 --> 37:37.387
[raza whooshing]

37:38.790 --> 37:45.328
[grunting]

37:45.330 --> 37:48.832
[quick, deep breaths]

37:48.834 --> 37:54.971
[grunting]

37:54.973 --> 37:56.039
Pretty crazy day.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.041
Can't remember one that wasn't.

38:00.746 --> 38:04.414
So, what're we going to do
about our two mutineers?

38:04.416 --> 38:08.285
Well, truth is,
they didn't mean us any harm.

38:08.487 --> 38:12.522
We felt it was worth the risk
to save the android; they didn'.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.924
What about the sabotage?

38:17.996 --> 38:21.631
The android analyzed
the part she replaced.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.633
Turns out it
really was defective.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.302
There was no sabotage.

38:32.477 --> 38:36.079
[breathing heavily]

38:36.081 --> 38:37.681
Anchor me.

38:54.466 --> 38:55.699
I've been thinking.

38:55.934 --> 38:57.934
Why would whoever did this
target our memories?

38:57.936 --> 39:00.003
What was their endgame?

39:00.005 --> 39:03.807
Well, five seemed to think it
was because we were "dangerous."

39:03.809 --> 39:05.642
Yeah but, dangerous how?

39:05.644 --> 39:08.912
As far as i can tell, dangerous
in every sense of the word.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.915
No, i know, i just--

39:11.917 --> 39:13.983
We've all got
bounties on our heads.

39:13.985 --> 39:16.986
If you wanted
to capture us, to subdue us,

39:16.988 --> 39:19.556
What would be
the best way to do it?

39:19.558 --> 39:21.958
There's got to be easier ways
than erasing our memories.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.960
What if what
he actually wanted to do

39:23.962 --> 39:25.795
Was only target part of them.

39:31.937 --> 39:32.953
"he"?

39:32.954 --> 39:33.970
Look, we may have
lost our memories,

39:33.972 --> 39:36.106
But i think it's
pretty safe to say

39:36.108 --> 39:37.807
That we didn't lose
our personalities.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.810
And there's only one person on
this ship who's made no bones

39:40.812 --> 39:42.512
About looking out
for number one.

39:44.116 --> 39:45.582
So, looking out for you?

39:45.584 --> 39:46.850
You know what i mean.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.151
He wants to sell the ship.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.919
He could care less
about the "team."

39:49.921 --> 39:52.922
I understand the need
to want to make sense of all th,

39:52.924 --> 39:55.392
But you have to make
peace with the fact

39:55.394 --> 39:56.860
That we'll probably never know.

39:56.862 --> 40:00.029
And throwing around
accusations isn't going to help.

40:00.031 --> 40:02.966
Your mind would be
better put to other pursuits.

40:13.044 --> 40:13.977
Sorry.

40:17.983 --> 40:18.782
I should--

40:19.918 --> 40:21.718
Six wanted me to--

40:25.924 --> 40:27.690
Goodnight.

This is your report from the br.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.786
Ship's engines are operating
within acceptable parameters.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.824
At current rate of travel,
we should be arriving

In approximately 11 hours and 2.

I've programmed

By the time we dock at the stat.

will be comprised of

41:47.205 --> 41:49.973
Hydrated protein packets,
bacon and egg flavor,

41:49.975 --> 41:51.808
As well as orange juice.

Hey, knock it off!

Goodnight.

Goodnight!

[man] i'm looking for
a ship called the raza.

42:12.964 --> 42:15.665
I hear it may've come
through here a while back.

42:15.667 --> 42:18.268
[bartender] lots of ships
come through here.

42:18.270 --> 42:20.236
This one's special.

42:20.238 --> 42:23.740
I've been trying to catch up
to it for some time now.

42:23.742 --> 42:27.877
I've got some unfinished
business with someone on board.

42:27.879 --> 42:30.079
You're free to ask around.

42:30.081 --> 42:33.550
If you make it worth my while,
i can ask around for you.

42:33.552 --> 42:36.119
What's your name?

42:36.121 --> 42:37.787
Corso.

42:37.789 --> 42:39.856
The name's jace corso.
