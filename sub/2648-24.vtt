WEBVTT

00:02.744 --> 00:04.700
- Right?

00:04.787 --> 00:06.660
Yeah. Hey, Mom.

00:06.747 --> 00:08.703
Listen to this card Dad got
for Grandpa Jay.

00:08.790 --> 00:11.244
"Hip-hip-hip hooray.

00:11.333 --> 00:14.037
Save the extra hip.
You'll need it someday."

00:14.126 --> 00:15.833
- 'Cause he's old.

00:15.919 --> 00:17.994
Mmm. You're not giving him that.

00:18.087 --> 00:21.502
- Even if he drinks his other gift first?
- Nope.

00:21.589 --> 00:24.340
Ladies, do you remember
exactly one year ago today...

00:24.424 --> 00:27.626
when you did not have a gift for your
grandfather and it killed him just a little...

00:27.718 --> 00:30.588
so I suggested you start interviewing
all the members of the family...

00:30.679 --> 00:31.709
for a video tribute?

00:31.804 --> 00:34.969
Well, check it and burn.
We totally did that.

00:35.056 --> 00:36.550
Almost.

00:36.641 --> 00:38.597
We just need to finish the editing.

00:38.684 --> 00:40.841
And you should talk.
You haven't even started on your gift yet.

00:40.935 --> 00:43.472
- That's because I changed mine.

00:43.561 --> 00:45.600
I thought of a better idea yesterday.

00:45.688 --> 00:48.094
I think I came up with a better idea.

00:48.189 --> 00:51.604
Okay. My dad has a picture
of me and Mitchell when we were kids...

00:51.692 --> 00:53.564
standing in our old backyard.

00:53.651 --> 00:55.525
We're gonna re-create the picture.

00:55.611 --> 00:57.899
I did the same thing last year
for my parents for Christmas.

00:57.988 --> 00:59.149
It went over like gangbusters.

00:59.238 --> 01:02.653
You remember?
Funny.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.980
Oh, I do. I do.

01:05.075 --> 01:06.866
- Ohh.
- I do.

01:06.951 --> 01:09.737
Come on, girls. TV off.
It's your grandfather's birthday.

01:09.828 --> 01:12.531
We gotta start taking this seriously.

01:12.621 --> 01:14.780
Permission to come aboard.

01:15.748 --> 01:17.575
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:17.667 --> 01:19.705
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:19.793 --> 01:21.785
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:21.877 --> 01:23.750
<i># Hey, hey #</i>

01:23.837 --> 01:25.035
<i># Hey ##.</i>

01:27.464 --> 01:30.464
My best birthday memory:
I'm a teenager...

01:30.550 --> 01:33.218
and for some reason
I drag this boat out on the lake...

01:33.302 --> 01:36.716
and for hours,
I'm just lying there, fishing...

01:36.804 --> 01:38.796
alone with my thoughts.

01:38.888 --> 01:42.138
Fantastic. That's all I want this year.

01:42.224 --> 01:44.975
So, that's really going to be your day?
You're going fishing?

01:45.058 --> 01:46.885
With time out for a gourmet lunch.

01:46.977 --> 01:49.301
Sausage of the Month Club
really nailed it in May.

01:49.395 --> 01:52.478
But, honey, no offense. They almost
lost me last month with that chorizo.

01:52.564 --> 01:54.639
- Why no offense?

01:54.732 --> 01:57.648
It's a sausage. It's not on our flag.

02:00.902 --> 02:02.526
Lily, what you doing here?

02:02.611 --> 02:06.359
Surprise! We were just on our way to
get Jay's cake and thought we'd pop by.

02:06.448 --> 02:10.277
Lily was driving me crazy all morning.
I had to get rid of her.

02:10.366 --> 02:13.152
- She refuses to get dressed.

02:13.243 --> 02:15.235
- Well, did you try bribing her?
- Oh, no.

02:15.328 --> 02:18.078
Of course I did.
I cannot go back in there, Mitchell.

02:18.163 --> 02:20.534
- Why did we ever decide to have a kid?
- I don't know.

02:20.623 --> 02:22.081
- I don't know.

02:22.166 --> 02:23.493
Come on.

02:23.583 --> 02:25.207
She loves you so much.

02:25.293 --> 02:27.581
Just this morning
she was looking at a picture of you...

02:27.669 --> 02:29.460
and I swear
she was trying to say your name.

02:29.545 --> 02:30.541
Really?

02:32.172 --> 02:34.578
<i>Ay,</i> I would love
to spend more time with her...

02:34.673 --> 02:38.041
but I have to go to the mall
to get Jay's gift for his birthday.

02:38.134 --> 02:41.336
I'm sorry, sweetie.
Gloria's busy. No, don't cry.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.420
We should go.

02:43.512 --> 02:45.718
- Oh, maybe I can take her with me.
- Okay. Bag's packed.

02:45.805 --> 02:47.549
Have fun. Bye, sweetie.

02:47.641 --> 02:49.466
- Hey, Cam.
- Oh, hey, Manny.

02:49.558 --> 02:51.882
- Mom, is Jay still here?
- No. He just left.

02:51.976 --> 02:53.304
Shoot.

02:53.393 --> 02:54.935
Why? What's up, pal?

02:55.020 --> 02:57.936
I'm going over to a friend's house
where I may have to use this thing.

02:58.022 --> 03:00.856
I only used it once, and that
was to take a torte out of the oven.

03:00.941 --> 03:04.557
Okay, well, first, let's
loosen this thing up.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.275
- So what's her name?
- How'd you know?

03:08.362 --> 03:11.646
Well, you're pretending to be something
you're not. Boys do that for girls.

03:11.739 --> 03:13.695
Or really dreamy boys.

03:13.782 --> 03:16.153
Her name's Tara.
We have great chats online.

03:16.241 --> 03:19.941
She's really smart and funny,
but she's on a softball team.

03:20.036 --> 03:21.695
Well, nobody's perfect.

03:21.787 --> 03:24.359
Hey, you know what? Why don't we
go outside and toss the ball around.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.782
- Okay.
- Wow.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.746
And you know what?
I wouldn't worry too much.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.287
She's gonna like you
even if sports aren't your thing.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.406
Aren't my thing?

03:31.501 --> 03:34.703
I have a tennis racket upstairs
I only use as a bubble bath frother.

03:36.171 --> 03:38.661
- Wow.
- How do you put this on?

03:40.090 --> 03:41.632
- Excuse me, miss.
- Sorry.

03:41.716 --> 03:44.004
You answered to "miss."

03:44.093 --> 03:46.665
Hilarious. Hey.

03:46.761 --> 03:49.132
Glen Whipple... my college rival.

03:49.221 --> 03:52.340
Captain of the cheer squad,
winner of every robot battle.

03:52.431 --> 03:55.634
Every second I spent with the guy
just made me feel worse about myself.

03:55.725 --> 03:58.843
The only thing I could compete
with him in was close-up magic.

04:01.186 --> 04:04.352
Ah. Well, it's great to see you.

04:04.438 --> 04:07.107
Great to see you too.
And I believe this is yours.

04:07.190 --> 04:10.890
- What? When?
- Hey, you headed over to the card shop?

04:10.985 --> 04:13.272
I was in there earlier.
I got myself one of those musical cards.

04:13.361 --> 04:15.317
A little more expensive,
but I can swing it.

04:15.404 --> 04:17.728
- Oh, well, great to see you.
- Yeah.

04:17.822 --> 04:21.190
By the way, don't leave
without this quarter from behind your...

04:21.283 --> 04:23.358
- Come on, Phil.

04:23.450 --> 04:25.822
Good luck, Dunphy.
I'm off to get some new cross trainers.

04:25.910 --> 04:28.579
I blow through them pretty fast
with all this power walking I'm into.

04:28.662 --> 04:30.655
Catch you later.

04:34.583 --> 04:35.958
Phil!

04:36.042 --> 04:37.204
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:37.293 --> 04:39.699
- What are you two doing here?
- Shopping for tonight.

04:39.794 --> 04:41.205
Oh. I'll walk with you.

04:41.296 --> 04:42.705
- Where were you heading?
- The card store.

04:42.796 --> 04:45.251
What a beautiful child.

04:45.339 --> 04:47.296
You and your wife must be so happy.

04:47.383 --> 04:49.838
- Bye.

04:49.926 --> 04:53.839
I didn't think anything of it until other
people started making the same mistake.

04:53.928 --> 04:55.967
It reminded me
of a college job I had parking cars.

04:56.054 --> 04:58.805
<i>One day I had to park
an Aston Martin.</i>

04:58.890 --> 05:02.304
<i>I'll never forget the looks I got</i>
<i>driving that baby down the block...</i>

05:02.392 --> 05:04.467
<i>and I wasn't gonna dent this one.</i>

05:04.560 --> 05:08.722
Hey, uh, what would you think
about swinging by the shoe store?

05:08.813 --> 05:10.437
Okay, let's go.

05:14.400 --> 05:16.641
I still can't believe
all the looks we got driving over here.

05:16.735 --> 05:18.525
And yet you wore the hat the whole time.

05:18.611 --> 05:20.733
Don't you think we should park
on the next block over?

05:20.820 --> 05:21.851
This is all permit parking.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.732
- No. We used to live here. It's fine.
- Yeah, still, I... Oh.

05:24.823 --> 05:27.776
- I don't think anybody's home.

05:27.867 --> 05:30.191
- You don't?
- Here. Hang on to this.

05:30.285 --> 05:33.119
- What? Where are you going?
- The backyard.

05:33.203 --> 05:35.325
We'll take this picture really quickly,
and then we'll just get out of here.

05:35.413 --> 05:38.117
No, let's just...
let's just wait for them to come home.

05:38.207 --> 05:39.783
Okay, that-that's trespassing.

05:39.874 --> 05:41.866
No, it's not. We used to live here.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.243
- I don't think that does what you think it does.
- Of course you would baby out...

05:45.336 --> 05:47.328
because this is just like
pool-hopping all over again.

05:47.420 --> 05:49.128
I don't see what was fun about that.

05:49.214 --> 05:50.956
It made going
in Grandma's pool less special.

05:51.048 --> 05:53.004
Why don't you try being
a little less special?

05:53.090 --> 05:55.083
- Oh...

05:55.176 --> 05:56.799
Is it far?

06:04.014 --> 06:06.718
- Hello.
- <i>Hi. It's Sandra from the dog groomer.</i>

06:06.807 --> 06:09.096
<i>I'm trying to reach Gloria.
Stella's ready.</i>

06:09.185 --> 06:12.053
Oh, I must have her phone.
She probably grabbed mine again.

06:12.144 --> 06:14.053
Listen. This is her husband.

06:14.146 --> 06:16.683
You have my number right there probably.
Give that a call.

06:16.773 --> 06:18.349
<i>Oh, okay. Thanks.</i>

06:25.528 --> 06:27.853
Yeah, it's me again. I'll be right there.

06:28.821 --> 06:30.814
Yeah, I did blame her for no reason.

06:30.907 --> 06:32.945
You have a little bit of an attitude,
you know that?

06:33.033 --> 06:36.732
You know who did your job in my day?
A hose.

06:36.910 --> 06:38.737
- Okay, a little to your left.
- Yes, okay.

06:38.828 --> 06:41.200
- Right there. That's it. Perfect. Okay.
- Hurry.

06:41.288 --> 06:42.947
- And I was right...
- Quickly.

06:43.039 --> 06:44.319
- Here.
- Okay. Fast.

06:44.415 --> 06:45.659
Here we go.

06:45.749 --> 06:47.705
- It's weird being back here, isn't it?
- I know.

06:47.792 --> 06:50.542
Everything looks exactly the same.
Except for the fence.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.620
Yeah, what's with that?
Who are they trying to keep out anyway?

06:52.712 --> 06:54.419
- I don't know.

06:54.505 --> 06:55.500
Oh, God.
- Oh.

06:55.588 --> 06:57.581
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- Oh, wow. Oh, my God.

06:57.674 --> 07:00.424
- No, it's okay. He might be friendly. He's nice.
- He's so... He's nice.

07:01.551 --> 07:03.093
- Oh! Oh, God!

07:03.177 --> 07:05.085
So not nice.

07:05.178 --> 07:07.004
Hurry. Hurry, hurry. Oh, God.

07:09.056 --> 07:12.257
- Now what do we do?
- Well, you could try telling him we used to live here.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.135
They're never coming home.
We need to call someone.

07:19.229 --> 07:21.267
Use your phone.
Mine's down there getting rabies on it.

07:21.355 --> 07:23.263
- No, I left mine in your car.
- What?

07:23.356 --> 07:26.190
- Well, I didn't wanna ruin the line in my pants.
- Oh, God.

07:26.275 --> 07:28.313
- Oh, look. Somebody's coming.

07:28.401 --> 07:30.393
No. Okay, that is what happens...

07:30.486 --> 07:31.979
when you park without a permit.

07:32.070 --> 07:34.477
Stop! That's ours! We're up here!

07:35.406 --> 07:36.650
Stop!

07:36.739 --> 07:38.115
He ignored me.

07:38.199 --> 07:41.283
He didn't stop
for the screaming sailor in a tree?

07:41.368 --> 07:42.695
Give me your shoe.

07:42.785 --> 07:44.943
You think that wolf down there's
gonna be afraid of a shoe?

07:45.036 --> 07:47.443
No. No, I don't.

07:48.455 --> 07:51.159
Wha...
What are you doing with dad's wine?

07:51.249 --> 07:53.039
- Getting comfortable.
- Eesh.

07:53.125 --> 07:55.745
We could be up here...
for a really long time.

07:55.835 --> 07:59.452
- Whoa. Where did you learn how to do that?

07:59.546 --> 08:01.538
Where did you get
a sailor's suit on short notice?

08:01.630 --> 08:03.871
- Fair enough.
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.965 --> 08:05.922
Ew. It's merlot.

08:09.302 --> 08:10.500
Hello.

08:10.595 --> 08:12.551
Manny! Hey, how did it go with Tara?

08:12.637 --> 08:14.179
- It's still going on.

08:14.264 --> 08:17.845
The catch part went fine, mostly.
I took a running dive into the dirt.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.724
Well, did you at least catch the ball?

08:19.809 --> 08:23.472
I was trying to throw the ball. I'm in
her bathroom looking for Band-Aids.

08:23.561 --> 08:25.718
I'm trying to get up the nerve
to tell her how I feel.

08:25.812 --> 08:27.556
Well, just be honest.

08:27.647 --> 08:30.979
<i>She intimidates me. Every time</i> <i>I
open my mouth, I say something stupid.</i>

08:31.065 --> 08:34.149
I called her bedroom "fantazing."
That's not even a word.

08:34.234 --> 08:35.942
Are you okay in there, Manny?

08:36.028 --> 08:38.696
Yeah. I'm just water washing my hands!

08:38.779 --> 08:41.778
Help me. Tell me what to say.

08:41.864 --> 08:43.903
Okay, how about this?

08:43.991 --> 08:48.485
You are the prettiest, smartest,
funniest girl in the sixth grade.

08:48.577 --> 08:53.153
I know you're only 11,
but I can't stop thinking about you.

08:53.246 --> 08:55.487
I've loved talking to you online.

08:55.581 --> 08:58.451
I think we should become
boyfriend and girlfriend.

08:58.541 --> 09:01.494
Oh, no, it's not what you think.
I'm talking to a little boy.

09:02.252 --> 09:03.450
- Oh.

09:09.423 --> 09:11.380
Hello.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.708
She's not with me, Cam. I got her phone.

09:13.802 --> 09:15.959
Why are you crying?

09:16.053 --> 09:18.625
How do you get kicked out of a bakery?

09:18.721 --> 09:22.006
- Well, that'll do it.
- I'm sorry to ask you to get your own birthday cake...

09:22.098 --> 09:26.260
- but I can't get ahold of any-anyone else.
- <i>Can't do it.</i>

09:26.351 --> 09:30.513
I'm on my way to the lake, finally.
Just get something at the grocery store.

09:30.604 --> 09:33.438
I am not getting you a grocery-store cake.

09:33.522 --> 09:36.095
Gloria asked me to handle this.
She's gonna yell at me, Jay.

09:36.190 --> 09:38.017
She can be mean in Spanish.

09:38.108 --> 09:39.518
Okay, fine.

09:39.609 --> 09:42.181
- Let's wrap this up, Princess.
- Okay. Love you. Bye.

09:43.445 --> 09:44.820
What are you guys doing?

09:44.904 --> 09:46.861
Just editing our birthday tribute
to Grandpa.

09:46.948 --> 09:49.319
Some of the interviews I did
didn't turn out so well.

09:49.407 --> 09:52.324
That's okay. We'll just use the best stuff
from what we all got.

09:52.409 --> 09:55.113
- <i>  Okay, Haley, talk about Grandpa.</i>
- <i>Ew!</i>

09:55.203 --> 09:57.527
<i>I can't talk about Grandpa</i>
<i>dressed like this.</i>

09:57.621 --> 10:00.289
<i> </i>

10:00.373 --> 10:03.740
- <i>I love</i> my...
- <i> </i>

10:03.833 --> 10:06.370
<i>That stupid dog next door!</i>

10:06.459 --> 10:08.748
<i>Jay! Jay!</i>

10:08.837 --> 10:10.294
<i>Jay!</i>

10:10.379 --> 10:13.961
- <i>Three, four, five... No.</i>
- <i>  Uncle Mitch, what do you think...</i>

10:14.048 --> 10:15.956
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- <i>Uh, nothing.</i>

10:16.049 --> 10:20.341
<i>You didn't see this, and we
don't tell Cam.</i> Capisce?

10:20.426 --> 10:22.584
- <i>  it'll only take one minute.</i>
- <i>We don't have a minute.</i>

10:22.678 --> 10:24.920
- <i>Who's Clive Bixby?</i>
- <i>A friend of your mom's.</i>

10:25.013 --> 10:26.388
<i>Not now!</i>

10:26.472 --> 10:28.843
- <i>  Hey, Uncle Cam,</i> can you talk about Jay?
- <i>Jay. I know.</i>

10:28.932 --> 10:31.802
<i>No time. I got a little girl's birthday
party</i> <i>to save. Skedaddle. Go.</i>

10:31.892 --> 10:33.800
<i>Oh, not now, honey.</i>

10:33.893 --> 10:36.016
<i>Your father's out back.</i>
<i>Why don't you call him?</i>

10:36.103 --> 10:39.553
<i>Phil... Dad! Your kids need you!</i>

10:39.647 --> 10:41.272
<i>Grandpa is really cool.</i>

10:41.357 --> 10:43.349
- <i>He once let me drink some of his beer.</i>
- <i> </i>

10:43.442 --> 10:45.314
- <i>For the love</i> of...
- <i>Root beer.</i>

10:46.152 --> 10:48.060
I could've sworn we had more.

10:48.153 --> 10:51.603
Well, let me work my magic.
It's all about creative editing.

10:51.697 --> 10:55.065
Just give me two hours and another hour.

10:55.157 --> 10:57.445
Someone get me some chocolate milk...

10:57.534 --> 10:59.276
with extra salt.

10:59.368 --> 10:59.410
Do you remember the time you quit
Cub Scouts and Dad got mad at you...

10:59.410 --> 11:02.944
Do you remember the time you quit
Cub Scouts and Dad got mad at you...

11:03.037 --> 11:04.780
- so you ran away up here?
- Right.

11:04.872 --> 11:07.362
And you brought me my dinner up here
and my comic books.

11:07.457 --> 11:09.744
Yep. I think Mom and Dad
would have been a lot more scared...

11:09.833 --> 11:11.825
if you hadn't been running into the house
to use the bathroom.

11:11.917 --> 11:14.076
I can't go outside.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.920
- Great. Now I'm thinking about it.
- Mitchell.

11:17.004 --> 11:18.463
It's ironic.

11:18.547 --> 11:22.164
We always wanted a dog in this backyard
and we could never have one.

11:22.258 --> 11:23.917
Ye-Yeah. Manny got one.

11:24.009 --> 11:25.835
Hmm. Manny gets everything.

11:25.926 --> 11:27.337
Yeah.

11:27.428 --> 11:29.882
Hey, do you think Manny's
gonna get a third of...

11:30.763 --> 11:32.839
- A third of what?
- You know.

11:32.931 --> 11:36.548
Oh. Uh... I guess.

11:36.641 --> 11:38.799
- Sure. I mean, that seems fair, right?
- Does it?

11:38.893 --> 11:42.474
- Claire, does it?
- We've probably had enough of this.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.353
Okay, wait.

11:46.440 --> 11:49.191
Do you think if we can get
the dog to chase this doll...

11:49.275 --> 11:51.682
Then we can run down
and grab the phone really quick.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.104
- We could do that.
- Yeah.

11:53.194 --> 11:55.684
We just are going to have
to throw it really, really far.

11:58.322 --> 12:00.196
Right. So...

12:00.282 --> 12:01.740
- That way.
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.824 --> 12:04.397
Gloria, I'd still love
to swing by that shoe store.

12:04.493 --> 12:08.276
If you're in a hurry, go by yourself.

12:08.370 --> 12:09.912
No. I'll wait.

12:09.996 --> 12:12.486
Whipple! Whipple!

12:12.581 --> 12:14.786
Okay.

12:14.874 --> 12:16.333
What do you think?

12:16.417 --> 12:18.788
Oh, it's perfect. Let's see the other side.

12:18.877 --> 12:20.287
Whipple!
- Bless you.

12:20.377 --> 12:22.287
Thank you.
- It's a little too tight, no?

12:22.378 --> 12:24.288
What do you think of the tush?

12:24.380 --> 12:27.464
Oh, I think it's great. Keep it there
for a second. Let's make sure.

12:27.549 --> 12:29.956
Yeah, but it's a little see-through.

12:30.051 --> 12:33.418
Maybe if I put this underneath,
then it won't, like, show...

12:33.511 --> 12:35.468
No, no, no, no, no. It looks good that way.

12:35.554 --> 12:37.629
- I go try something else better.
- No, wait!

12:37.722 --> 12:39.050
Wait.

12:42.266 --> 12:44.887
Oh, don't think about it. Just get it.

12:44.976 --> 12:46.885
Hilarious, Whipple.
I'm actually here with someone.

12:46.977 --> 12:48.970
Then you finally did make
something disappear.

12:49.063 --> 12:51.517
- She was here a second ago.
- Of course she was.

12:51.606 --> 12:55.187
Just like that date you had on the final
night dance of Junior Tumbling Congress.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.563
- There was traffic.
Sure.

12:57.652 --> 13:02.644
I think I found something that is going
to make my husband very happy.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.694
What do you think?

13:04.781 --> 13:07.353
- Oh, very happy, Gloria.
- Oh!

13:07.449 --> 13:08.942
Very happy.

13:11.993 --> 13:15.658
Okay, but don't go far away because
I might need help with the zipper, okay?

13:15.746 --> 13:18.070
Sounds good, with the zipper.

13:18.164 --> 13:21.698
Wow. Phil. I mean, wow.
That's your wife?

13:21.792 --> 13:23.499
It would appear so.

13:23.584 --> 13:25.659
- Great to see you, Glen.

13:25.752 --> 13:27.294
Oh! Hmm.

13:28.421 --> 13:30.792
You know,
I gotta say I'm a little surprised.

13:30.880 --> 13:32.588
Surprised?

13:32.674 --> 13:34.132
Or mystified?

13:34.216 --> 13:37.002
Damn it. It went down your shirt.
You can keep it.

13:37.093 --> 13:38.716
- I'll see ya.
- No, no.

13:38.802 --> 13:41.127
I just always assumed
you would marry Claire Pritchett.

13:41.221 --> 13:43.343
- You remember Claire?
- Are you kidding?

13:43.431 --> 13:46.633
She was gorgeous.
God, I was so jealous of you back then.

13:46.725 --> 13:49.096
- You were jealous of me?
- Oh, man.

13:49.184 --> 13:52.717
Claire Pritchett, with
the blonde hair and those brown eyes.

13:52.811 --> 13:55.764
Great smile.
Oh, I can picture her smiling right now.

13:55.855 --> 13:57.135
I can't.

13:57.231 --> 14:00.479
I wonder who landed her.
Lucky son of a bitch.

14:00.566 --> 14:02.274
Yeah.

14:02.359 --> 14:06.022
- Phil, I need you!
- What now?

14:06.111 --> 14:08.483
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

14:08.571 --> 14:11.109
I'll be there in a second.

14:11.198 --> 14:13.237
No! How?

14:15.534 --> 14:17.656
What the hell were you thinking?

14:17.744 --> 14:20.660
I'll answer that for you.
You weren't thinking.

14:20.746 --> 14:22.821
- You think that's funny, Popeye?

14:22.913 --> 14:24.823
- No.
- Popeye.

14:24.914 --> 14:27.914
I should be fishing,
but I'm hauling my ass across town...

14:28.000 --> 14:30.572
trying to save you two from a little dog.

14:30.668 --> 14:33.704
- At least we got to have a dog for a few minutes.
- Here we go.

14:33.795 --> 14:37.495
You could show a little gratitude,
you know. These pants are new.

14:37.590 --> 14:39.914
Climbing over that fence,
I might have wrecked 'em.

14:42.676 --> 14:44.632
That's mature.

14:44.719 --> 14:47.339
- I'm sorry. We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.421
Sorry you said "rectum."

14:51.849 --> 14:54.054
I'm sorry, Dad,
and we're so glad that you came...

14:54.142 --> 14:55.635
- Thank you.
- And got us.

14:55.726 --> 14:58.642
That was very smart the way
that you distracted the dog.

14:58.728 --> 15:01.479
Twelve times a year I get sausages.
That's it.

15:01.563 --> 15:03.519
What the hell am I gonna do till June?

15:03.606 --> 15:06.606
- Hey.
- Ah, let's see it.

15:06.691 --> 15:08.102
Okay.

15:08.193 --> 15:11.109
- It's beautiful.
- We just need some candles.

15:11.194 --> 15:14.147
- I-I must have in one of the drawers.
- Okay.

15:14.237 --> 15:15.732
Okay.

15:15.822 --> 15:20.399
Froot Loop necklace. Baby Jesus. Keys.

15:20.492 --> 15:22.068
I was looking for these keys.

15:22.159 --> 15:27.069
Baby Jesus. BB gun.
More baby Jesus. <i>Ay,</i> another baby...

15:27.163 --> 15:29.831
Jesus, Stella, don't do that!

15:29.915 --> 15:31.823
Gloria.
- No, Jay!

15:31.916 --> 15:35.200
Don't come in here. You cannot see
the cake. It's the bad luck.

15:35.293 --> 15:38.577
I already saw the cake.
I bought it while I was busy not fishing.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.627
No. Go to the bar. Go.

15:40.713 --> 15:43.666
You never used to talk to me like that
before we got that damn dog.

15:45.049 --> 15:47.800
Hey, Manny, I almost called you.
How did it go with Tara?

15:47.884 --> 15:49.129
Okay, I guess.

15:49.219 --> 15:52.005
I used every line you gave me
and she totally ate it up.

15:52.095 --> 15:53.672
Well, then why just okay?

15:53.763 --> 15:56.798
She wants to go on a date now,
to the batting cage.

15:56.890 --> 15:59.676
Oh. Not so good with a bat?

15:59.767 --> 16:03.632
I am, as long as I'm using it
to roll out dough.

16:03.727 --> 16:06.561
I'll bet you just need a little practice.

16:06.646 --> 16:10.939
You know, when I was your age,
I couldn't hit a balloon with a bat...

16:11.024 --> 16:12.648
and my father took me out to the field...

16:12.733 --> 16:16.184
and a couple of hours later,
I was knocking the hide off that ball.

16:16.277 --> 16:20.143
- It's one of the best days we ever had together.
- Really?

16:20.238 --> 16:23.522
Yeah. I just bet you need
some time in a batting cage.

16:23.615 --> 16:26.105
What are you doing this weekend?
That'd be fun, huh?

16:26.200 --> 16:29.366
That's a great idea. I'll ask Jay.
He loves stuff like this.

16:29.452 --> 16:30.696
Oh.

16:30.786 --> 16:32.779
- That'll be great for you guys.
- Yeah.

16:32.870 --> 16:35.575
And thanks for your help today, Cam.

16:36.164 --> 16:37.659
You got it.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.620
I don't think
Grandpa's having the best time.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.751
He keeps going and getting more drinks.

16:47.839 --> 16:48.870
Well, not every time.

16:48.965 --> 16:51.537
One time he went in to check on
the women's basketball score.

16:51.633 --> 16:54.088
The Sparks are up by eight
if anybody cares.

16:54.176 --> 16:56.880
Okay, Dad...

16:56.970 --> 16:59.175
we all owe you an apology.

16:59.263 --> 17:01.338
We were so worried
about giving you a great night...

17:01.431 --> 17:02.924
that we ruined your day...

17:03.015 --> 17:04.972
and we're really sorry
we didn't let you go fishing.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.136
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry, Jay.

17:06.224 --> 17:07.339
- Sorry.
Sorry, Jay.

17:07.435 --> 17:10.103
You know what? I'm acting like a jerk.

17:10.185 --> 17:11.596
What am I, 12?

17:11.686 --> 17:13.015
Hey.

17:13.105 --> 17:15.724
So I didn't get to go fishing.
Am I gonna pout about it?

17:15.815 --> 17:18.435
I still have my family,
and you guys made such a big fuss.

17:18.525 --> 17:19.983
I love you all.

17:20.067 --> 17:21.443
Ohh!
- Ohh!

17:21.527 --> 17:24.098
- So let's go get some cake and presents.
Yeah!

17:24.194 --> 17:26.104
Cake and presents. Come on, everybody.

17:26.195 --> 17:29.730
Honey, have I told you
how lucky I am to have you?

17:29.824 --> 17:32.195
Gloria, excuse me. 'Cause I am.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.777
- Okay.
# Ha... #.

17:33.868 --> 17:35.196
No singing.

17:35.286 --> 17:38.949
- What the hell happened to the cake?
- Nothing. It's beautiful.

17:39.038 --> 17:41.575
- Okay, let's open the presents.
- Yes. The presents.

17:41.664 --> 17:43.242
- Who's first? There we go.
- Mine first. Mine first.

17:43.333 --> 17:45.455
As you know,
Claire and I didn't quite finish ours.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.783
- But we will be getting that to you.
- Fine.

17:47.877 --> 17:51.624
- And our gift is a fuller version of that, and a card.
- Wonderful.

17:51.713 --> 17:55.246
- And, of course, the cake is, uh, mine.
- Fantastic.

17:55.340 --> 17:59.632
And here we have a phone
in the shape of a mouth.

17:59.718 --> 18:01.959
Ah, you're welcome. Very sexy.

18:02.053 --> 18:04.009
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.
Let me work this out.

18:04.095 --> 18:06.668
I mentioned a few times
I was thinking of taking up the saxophone.

18:06.764 --> 18:08.387
You give me this.

18:08.473 --> 18:10.880
I got it. Is this a "sexy phone"?

18:10.974 --> 18:13.678
- Happy birthday!
- Wow.

18:13.768 --> 18:15.392
What else we got?

18:15.478 --> 18:18.597
Oh. Uh, nothing.

18:18.688 --> 18:21.772
Maybe not a perfect showing
on behalf of the adults in the family...

18:21.856 --> 18:23.932
but don't forget the kids
still have their big gift.

18:24.025 --> 18:25.648
And it took us a year to make.

18:25.734 --> 18:28.402
- It's in the D VD player. You gotta come watch it.
Okay.

18:28.486 --> 18:30.477
- Come on.
I'm so excited. Let's go, Jay.

18:30.570 --> 18:33.523
- I bring your sexy phone.
- Ah, you don't forget that.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.440
And, uh, we all participated...

18:36.532 --> 18:38.524
- so this is kind of from all of us.
- Yeah.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.408
Hit the lights.

18:46.413 --> 18:47.824
- <i>Dad!</i>
- <i>Jay!</i>

18:47.915 --> 18:48.911
<i>Jay!</i>

18:50.250 --> 18:51.826
- <i>Grandpa...</i>
- We...

18:51.917 --> 18:53.494
- <i>Love...</i>
- <i>Ew!</i>

18:53.585 --> 18:54.367
Capisce?

18:57.754 --> 18:59.082
Well...

19:00.130 --> 19:03.047
- Well, who wants to see it again?
- Um...

19:03.132 --> 19:06.583
That's it? That's all you used?
I wasn't even in it.

19:06.677 --> 19:09.546
- That totally sucked.
- You know what? Great party.

19:09.637 --> 19:12.471
Thank you all for coming.
And I hope you forgive me.

19:12.555 --> 19:17.180
I'm gonna go upstairs, curl up
with a Ludlum and call it a day.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.302
Hello.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.972
Manny.

19:25.105 --> 19:26.599
Where are you?

19:27.481 --> 19:29.521
What are you doing out there?

19:33.652 --> 19:35.146
What the hell?

19:35.237 --> 19:38.355
I dragged it back here this afternoon.
I know it's not the lake.

19:38.446 --> 19:41.731
But maybe we could pop open a few
drinks and hang out on the water.

19:43.075 --> 19:45.031
Now, the old Jay would have said...

19:45.118 --> 19:48.735
"I wanted to be on a lake
with a fishing rod and sunshine...

19:48.829 --> 19:52.160
not bobbing around at night
in a swimming pool."

19:53.373 --> 19:55.281
I miss the old Jay.

19:55.374 --> 19:58.908
- This is the life, huh?
- It ain't half bad.

19:59.002 --> 20:01.918
<i>Ay,</i> I want to get in the boat.

20:02.004 --> 20:03.829
Captain?
- All right.

20:03.921 --> 20:07.170
I wanna get in the boat if she's getting in.
- I wanna get in.

20:07.257 --> 20:09.379
You want to?
- So how was your day with Claire?

20:09.466 --> 20:12.336
Actually, it was really great.

20:12.427 --> 20:16.553
I don't always think about it, but I was
really lucky to have her to grow up with.

20:16.637 --> 20:19.092
I cannot imagine dealing
with my crazy parents alone.

20:19.180 --> 20:20.461
Yeah.

20:22.641 --> 20:24.882
- Cam?
- Hmm?

20:24.976 --> 20:28.142
I... I wanna have another baby.

20:31.147 --> 20:34.063
What would you think
about a boy this time?

20:34.149 --> 20:35.559
All right, easy. Easy.

20:35.649 --> 20:39.728
- No, no, no. You're rocking the boat!
- I got Claire! I got Claire!

20:39.819 --> 20:41.312
All right, ahoy.

20:41.403 --> 20:44.688
So if we all just enter through
the starboard section and then...

20:48.283 --> 20:50.405
Okay, everybody, upstairs.

20:50.492 --> 20:52.484
And, Luke, I want you to get
in a hot bath right away.

20:52.577 --> 20:55.363
- I'm still shivering.
- That's why you don't stand up in a boat.

20:55.454 --> 20:58.952
- I was king of the world.
- Now you're dork of the night.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.909
Honey, have I told you how lucky I am?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.541
You mean since dinner?

21:03.626 --> 21:05.249
I can't help it.

21:05.335 --> 21:08.288
Your beautiful eyes, your silky hair.

21:08.378 --> 21:11.497
Promise me you'll never... change.

21:12.590 --> 21:14.914
I have to admit, that's kind of hot.

21:15.008 --> 21:17.628
Maybe I will go change. Mmm.

21:18.510 --> 21:21.675
Mmm. I still got it.

21:21.762 --> 21:23.754
Knock it off.

21:30.684 --> 21:31.680
