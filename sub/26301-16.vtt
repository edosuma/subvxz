00:03.831 --> 00:06.218
<i>Why do I let Greg
drag me to these stupid</i>

00:06.243 --> 00:08.125
<i>Westport Historical Guild things?</i>

00:08.151 --> 00:09.555
<i>I haven't seen this many dorks</i>

00:09.580 --> 00:12.306
<i>since my high school's
Model UN conference.</i>

00:12.340 --> 00:14.615
<i>Everyone's lucky I'm not
busting in with my posse</i>

00:14.640 --> 00:16.912
<i>and water balloons full
of pudding this time.</i>

00:16.945 --> 00:18.914
<i>Being an adult blows.</i>

00:18.947 --> 00:20.681
My favorite historic site on
the Connecticut registry

00:20.706 --> 00:22.278
is definitely the Walker House,

00:22.310 --> 00:23.891
built by Major Ebenezer Dooley...

00:23.916 --> 00:25.999
Captain Ebenezer Dooley.

00:26.024 --> 00:27.743
The house was built in 1795.

00:27.782 --> 00:29.450
Ebenezer was yet to be promoted.

00:29.483 --> 00:31.619
Nice catch.

00:31.653 --> 00:33.821
Ah, yes, Ebenezer Dooley.

00:33.854 --> 00:36.991
Remembered for his amazing
legacy of leaving parties early.

00:37.024 --> 00:39.360
Let's honor him by getting
the hell out of here.

00:39.393 --> 00:41.095
Wait, Katie, I want you to meet Dane.

00:41.128 --> 00:42.363
He's one of our Guild's new members.

00:42.396 --> 00:43.464
Nice to meet you, Katie.

00:43.497 --> 00:45.500
Are you a history buff as well?

00:45.534 --> 00:47.469
The buffest.

00:47.501 --> 00:49.370
Greg, you said this mixer
was from 7:00 to 9:00.

00:49.403 --> 00:52.707
It's 9:03, better shut this down
before tempers start to flare.

00:52.741 --> 00:53.775
Whose temper's gonna flare?

00:53.808 --> 00:56.512
Hey, numbnuts, what you looking at?

00:56.545 --> 00:58.299
Okay. We should go.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.860
I should head out as well.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.228
I need to adjust my humidor.

01:01.262 --> 01:02.963
Oh, you're into cigars?

01:02.997 --> 01:04.065
Oh, God, no.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.437
My humidor is filled with
historical pantaloons

01:09.470 --> 01:10.905
from the Revolutionary War.

01:10.937 --> 01:13.140
- Gotta keep 'em damp.
- Oh, that's true.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.142
Dane, is your wife into
pantaloons as well?

01:15.175 --> 01:16.877
Oh, I'm not married.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.411
I know.

01:18.445 --> 01:19.780
Nice to meet you, Katie.

01:19.814 --> 01:21.419
And, Greg, let me know
about tomorrow night.

01:21.444 --> 01:22.884
Tomorrow night?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.585
There's not another mixer, right?

01:24.618 --> 01:25.652
No, he wants to hang out.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.655
He wants to hang out with you?
Even with that haircut?

01:28.922 --> 01:30.223
It actually sounds like a fun night,

01:30.256 --> 01:31.559
but inviting me over to hang out?

01:31.592 --> 01:32.927
- Who does that?
- That's what adults do

01:32.960 --> 01:34.061
when they want to make friends.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.396
I don't need friends, I have you.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.297
True, but it puts a lot of
pressure on me

01:37.330 --> 01:39.266
to be your everything...
Your wife, your friend,

01:39.300 --> 01:41.169
your co-parent,
your person who looks away

01:41.202 --> 01:43.070
when you put lotion on
your elbows like this.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.006
I guess I could give Dane a shot.

01:45.038 --> 01:46.473
It'd be nice to come
to one of these things

01:46.506 --> 01:47.942
and not have you yell "BO-RING"

01:47.975 --> 01:49.443
every time someone brings up history.

01:49.476 --> 01:51.145
I don't do that every time.

01:51.178 --> 01:53.747
Sometimes I pretend that
I'm hard of hearing.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.183
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.346
Hm?

01:58.524 --> 02:01.329
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

02:05.124 --> 02:07.928
Look at this. Cooper, on a yacht.

02:07.962 --> 02:09.497
He said he couldn't hang out with me

02:09.529 --> 02:11.631
because he was gonna be
with his parents all weekend.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.301
Cooper's parents were actually in town?

02:13.333 --> 02:14.534
That's what he said.

02:14.568 --> 02:16.103
But look at this...

02:16.135 --> 02:17.204
I went to Facebook...

02:17.237 --> 02:18.672
Old people Internet.

02:18.706 --> 02:20.141
...and his parents posted
a picture of them

02:20.174 --> 02:22.309
on a different yacht in
a totally different ocean.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.946
He just didn't want to invite me
to his yacht party, so he lied.

02:24.979 --> 02:26.480
It was only a matter of time

02:26.512 --> 02:29.182
before Cooper got tired of his
poor friend mooching off of him.

02:29.216 --> 02:30.551
You really think that's true?

02:30.583 --> 02:32.018
That's what happened with me
and the Blondetourage.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.186
As soon as they realized

02:33.219 --> 02:34.955
I wasn't a privileged princess
like them,

02:34.988 --> 02:36.657
they dropped me like a hot tomato.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.024
It's, "drop you like a hot potato."

02:38.057 --> 02:39.192
No, it's not.

02:39.225 --> 02:40.994
Why would you ever drop a hot potato?

02:41.028 --> 02:42.330
Hot potatoes are French fries.

02:42.362 --> 02:44.397
- They're delicious.
- Oh, my God.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.235
Why don't you just ask Cooper
about the picture?

02:47.267 --> 02:49.135
That's not how you handle things
in high school.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.238
You need to hurt Cooper
like he hurt you.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.507
You need to get Insta-revenge.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.176
Huh.

02:55.208 --> 02:57.244
Good call. Take the dumb one's advice.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.413
- Hey!
- I wasn't talking about you.

02:59.445 --> 03:00.681
Oh, okay.

03:05.785 --> 03:06.854
Okay, I'll see you later.

03:06.886 --> 03:08.556
Have fun at Dane's!

03:10.424 --> 03:12.760
<i>Ahh, a night without Greg.</i>

03:12.793 --> 03:14.896
<i>I'm going to do whatever I want.</i>

03:14.928 --> 03:17.831
<i>The first thing is getting
a babysitter for Anna-Kat.</i>

03:24.737 --> 03:27.607
<i>Next I'm going to run
a half-full dishwasher.</i>

03:27.641 --> 03:29.568
<i>Greg says it's a waste of water,</i>

03:29.592 --> 03:30.977
<i>blah blah.</i>

03:30.978 --> 03:33.681
<i>And I'm going to watch as many
"Fast and Furious" movies</i>

03:33.713 --> 03:36.182
<i>as I want without Greg
always complaining</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:38.052
<i>about how no one wears seatbelts.</i>

03:43.057 --> 03:44.292
Hey!

03:44.325 --> 03:45.893
Hey, honey!

03:45.926 --> 03:47.361
How did it go with Dane?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.730
Ah, we had so much fun.

03:49.762 --> 03:52.033
He has an Eyecom 6000 microfiche reader.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.433
We looked at local proposed amendments

03:53.467 --> 03:55.937
- from the 1920s for hours.
- Mm.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.205
Sometimes the city council
would tackle public schools

03:58.237 --> 04:00.206
and zoning in the same meeting.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.742
Roaring '20s, indeed.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.577
Wow.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.415
That sounds... wow.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.050
It was wow.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.484
I think I have a new friend.

04:10.516 --> 04:13.454
- That's great, sweetheart.
- I know.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.990
So the Guild's "Party Like
It's 1799" shindig is coming up,

04:16.023 --> 04:18.426
and you have to be fitted
for your bonnet.

04:18.458 --> 04:21.930
Hey, why don't you go with your
new pal Dane instead of me?

04:23.831 --> 04:26.167
Sure. That would work.

04:27.300 --> 04:28.735
I'm sorry.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.737
Did I say the wrong thing?
Was that a test?

04:30.771 --> 04:34.442
No, it's just that I am so happy
that I don't have to go.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.145
This is all ready.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.282
If I am not home,
then somebody needs to put it

04:41.314 --> 04:43.149
in the oven at 5:00.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.618
Since when do you like Mom so much?

04:45.651 --> 04:46.987
Yeah, what the hell, Oliver?

04:47.021 --> 04:49.023
I told you... I don't have a will.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.358
He's taking pictures
to post on social media

04:51.391 --> 04:52.959
to get back at Cooper
for blowing him off.

04:52.992 --> 04:55.428
Yeah. What's the one thing
Cooper wants most

04:55.461 --> 04:56.529
but can't have?

04:56.562 --> 04:57.998
Mom.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.367
For some reason, he loves
the way she yells at him

05:00.401 --> 05:02.436
and that all of her recipes
are basically meat

05:02.468 --> 05:04.372
plus supermarket seasoning packets.

05:04.405 --> 05:07.675
You guys drive yourselves crazy
with this social media.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.044
When I was in high school, if
you had a problem with someone

05:10.076 --> 05:11.711
you challenged them to a fight,

05:11.744 --> 05:13.213
and you wore your biggest rings

05:13.247 --> 05:16.550
and you sucker-punched them
right before it started.

05:19.018 --> 05:20.655
Okay, have a great day at school.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.558
Dane has been to so many battle sites.

05:25.591 --> 05:27.694
Look at this picture from his
trip to the Battle of Yorktown.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.896
Hashtag Battle of Forktown.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.831
Because he's eating lunch.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.634
This guy is too much!

05:33.667 --> 05:35.703
He's a riot.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.971
Listen, tonight let's pajama-up

05:38.004 --> 05:39.874
and finally finish that puzzle
that's all candy bars.

05:39.906 --> 05:40.974
Oh, I can't, I have plans.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.175
You're Greg.

05:42.208 --> 05:43.343
You don't have plans.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.545
Oh, Dane invited me to climb
Sheffield Lighthouse

05:45.579 --> 05:47.081
after work and I said yes.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.651
Wow, you and Dane are really
getting serious.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.886
You think?

05:51.918 --> 05:53.319
We can finish the puzzle another night.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.922
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

05:54.954 --> 05:57.224
Go enjoy a night out
with your new friend.

05:59.959 --> 06:02.699
<i>Is Greg blowing me off?</i>

06:03.030 --> 06:05.700
Luthor, has he said anything to you?

06:07.567 --> 06:09.169
I see.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.572
Bros before hoes.

06:15.515 --> 06:17.778
...and then on Sunday, Greg and Dane did

06:17.810 --> 06:19.796
the "Benjamin Franklin ate here!" tour.

06:20.581 --> 06:22.383
Ugh, that sounds terrible.

06:22.415 --> 06:25.785
It's just a lot of time for Greg
to be spending with one friend.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.420
I get to be upset about this, right?

06:27.454 --> 06:30.223
No. You and Greg spend
way too much time together.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.059
Richard and I see each other
four times a month.

06:32.091 --> 06:34.694
Twice to get my allowance,
and two bone days.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.396
Look, Greg having a friend

06:36.430 --> 06:37.697
means less pressure on you.

06:37.730 --> 06:39.266
Now when you don't want to do
something with Greg,

06:39.298 --> 06:41.534
you don't have to feel guilty
because he has Dane.

06:41.567 --> 06:43.103
Mm! And since he has plans,

06:43.136 --> 06:44.370
you can finally come
to Girls' Night Out.

06:44.403 --> 06:45.706
- Yes.
- Oh, yes!

06:45.739 --> 06:46.910
I'm never free for Girls' Night Out.

06:46.935 --> 06:48.307
Let's do this.

06:51.410 --> 06:52.446
So Girls' Night Out is just

06:52.478 --> 06:54.247
doing the same thing, but at night?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.548
And with wine.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.157
- Hey.
- What do you want?

07:03.189 --> 07:04.557
Your mom made meatloaf.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.494
I always come over for meatloaf.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.829
You forgot to text me, but no
big... saw it on Instagram.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.264
I didn't forget.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.398
We don't really invite each
other to things anymore, right?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.835
Huh? <i>No comprende.</i>

07:14.867 --> 07:16.437
Well, maybe you'll <i>comprende</i> this.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.105
I saw your Insta from the yacht party.

07:18.138 --> 07:19.940
Oh.

07:19.973 --> 07:23.244
Well, technically the boat
was barely 33 feet,

07:23.276 --> 07:24.744
so it's more of a cabin cruiser...

07:24.778 --> 07:26.647
No, I get it,
I'm your little charity case,

07:26.680 --> 07:28.115
and you're done bringing me
around to your parties

07:28.148 --> 07:30.684
- with your rich friends.
- Whoa, <i>amigo</i>,

07:30.716 --> 07:32.353
you're coming in a little <i>caliente</i>.

07:32.386 --> 07:33.687
You don't have to slum it
around here anymore.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.289
Go back to your mansion.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.594
Well, technically it's an estate...

07:46.867 --> 07:48.968
So, you have a nice night?

07:49.002 --> 07:51.138
The best.

07:51.170 --> 07:52.772
I wish you could have seen
the view from the lighthouse.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.170
Oh, Dane posted some pictures...
I can show you my Instagram.

07:57.511 --> 07:58.879
You're on Instagram?

07:58.912 --> 07:59.880
Dane set it up for me.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.448
My handle's "Gerg Otto."

08:01.480 --> 08:03.216
I wanted to fix it,
but Dane thought it was funny.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.555
What are you laughing at?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.123
Just something Dane said.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.676
Dane.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.027
- Whoa.
- What is that?

08:13.059 --> 08:14.127
Just a D pic.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.297
- Wait, what?
- A D pic.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.131
A Dane pic. It's a pic of Dane.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.967
Oh, you've got to stop
abbreviating things.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.067
You're going to get into trouble.

08:21.100 --> 08:22.168
Hmm. How was your evening?

08:22.201 --> 08:23.636
So fun.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.840
Not microfiche fun, but right up there.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.875
So, tomorrow night
I was thinking that...

08:28.908 --> 08:29.909
I'm sorry, I'm going out with Dane.

08:29.942 --> 08:31.478
Again?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.547
Why am I just now hearing about this?

08:33.580 --> 08:35.316
You're not.
You said I should go with him

08:35.349 --> 08:37.850
to the "Party Like It's 1799"
shindig, remember?

08:37.884 --> 08:40.019
Oh, right.

08:40.052 --> 08:42.556
- You want me to cancel?
- No. No, no, no, no.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.658
Go have fun catching smallpox

08:44.691 --> 08:46.060
and starting every sentence with "ye."

08:48.061 --> 08:49.763
Dane used a filter to make us look like

08:49.796 --> 08:50.864
we're part of Mount Rushmore.

08:52.265 --> 08:53.700
Fun stuff.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.703
Turn off the phone
and go to sleep, Gerg.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.711
Dane. Come on in.

09:05.912 --> 09:08.182
Greg, your friend's here.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.884
Did you know that your house
is built on the spot

09:10.917 --> 09:12.452
where the Pequot Indians
first broke bread

09:12.485 --> 09:13.920
with the white settlers?

09:13.953 --> 09:15.622
Oh, that's boring.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.691
So, is everyone dressing up?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.627
Because the cape feels
a little over-the...

09:19.659 --> 09:21.594
- Cape bros!
- Cape bros!

09:21.628 --> 09:23.030
All right, honey, we're leaving.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.865
Oh, good. Because I have a lot
of plans tonight, too.

09:24.898 --> 09:25.932
Oh, great, what are you doing?

09:25.966 --> 09:27.735
A little of this, a little of that.

09:27.768 --> 09:28.902
A whole lot of the other thing.

09:28.935 --> 09:30.371
You know how I do.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.240
Super vague, but have fun.

09:33.472 --> 09:35.208
No, Doris, it's okay.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.610
I didn't realize that it
was the 16th already.

09:37.643 --> 09:40.748
I need to put you and Richard's
bone days in my calendar.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.750
Yeah, I already tried Angela.

09:42.783 --> 09:46.486
She is watching videos
of Robin Roberts on YouTube.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.288
I know.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.256
Go bone. I'll talk to you later.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.927
<i>Am I desperate enough to hang
out with Anna-Kat and Franklin?</i>

09:54.961 --> 09:55.962
<i>Yep!</i>

09:59.999 --> 10:01.601
What are you guys doing?

10:01.634 --> 10:02.869
Nothing.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.172
Sounds like you guys
are having a lot of fun.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.474
We're not.

10:07.507 --> 10:08.509
When is she leaving?

10:10.177 --> 10:12.713
- Guess I'll just go downstairs.
- 'Kay.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:21.620 --> 10:23.156
Look at this.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.159
Cooper was on a WaveRunner
having fun without me.

10:25.192 --> 10:26.159
Look at this.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.461
Right now your dad is at a party.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.363
Having fun without me.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.698
I can't stop looking at my phone.

10:31.731 --> 10:34.467
Now I know what you guys go
through with social media.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.202
Makes you feel like a loser, doesn't it?

10:36.235 --> 10:37.970
- We <i> are</i> losers.
- Total losers.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.773
We're garbage, human garbage.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.974
We should crawl into a dumpster.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.143
- And curl up and die.
- Yeah.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.747
Maybe you and I shouldn't be
around each other right now.

10:48.714 --> 10:49.817
Trip!

10:49.850 --> 10:51.451
I didn't know you were over.

10:51.485 --> 10:52.820
I'm so happy to see you.

10:52.852 --> 10:54.520
Wow, Mrs. A.

10:54.553 --> 10:56.622
I haven't been hugged like this
since I told my English teacher

10:56.656 --> 10:57.558
I was dropping his class.

10:57.591 --> 10:59.960
Mom, don't be weird.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.830
So, Dad is out again with
his new best friend Dane.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.898
Whatever. Who needs Dad? Not me.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.067
I have you guys. What are you doing?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.037
I have to observe the meteor
shower for homework,

11:10.070 --> 11:11.071
and Trip said he'd keep me company.

11:11.104 --> 11:13.240
- I'm in.
- I didn't invite you.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.875
Well, I didn't mean to have you,
so now we're even.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.582
Oh, wait. Meteor shower.

11:22.615 --> 11:24.217
Better grab an umbrella.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.418
Always thinking.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.989
You shall not destroy me!

11:29.022 --> 11:30.190
Show me what you got!

11:31.424 --> 11:32.992
What are you guys doing?

11:33.025 --> 11:34.594
Mom already tried to crash our playdate.

11:34.628 --> 11:35.929
Find your own friend.

11:35.961 --> 11:37.163
I don't have a friend.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.365
Yes, you do. Go talk to Cooper.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.835
What happened to Cooper...
Cooper the Pooper.

11:41.868 --> 11:43.771
Genius.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.505
He lied to me about his plans

11:45.538 --> 11:48.241
so he could go to a yacht party
without me last weekend.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.442
That's not last weekend.

11:49.475 --> 11:50.844
What are you talking about?

11:50.876 --> 11:53.246
Look... Those are Fourth
of July napkins.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.847
How did you even notice that?

11:54.880 --> 11:57.617
- I love themed napkins.
- He really does.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.419
It makes Christmas shopping a breeze.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.587
It is the Fourth of July.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.756
Why would Cooper lie to me
and post an old photo?

12:03.789 --> 12:05.291
Go talk to him and find out.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.560
I think I will.

12:06.592 --> 12:07.727
Thanks, Franklin.

12:10.897 --> 12:12.766
- What?
- It's not you.

12:12.798 --> 12:15.601
It's just when a woman
has an idea, he ignores it,

12:15.634 --> 12:19.639
but when a man says the same
thing, he's suddenly all ears.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.609
I wish I was all ears.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.812
Stupid nose.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.917
Sorry we haven't seen anything yet.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.451
Ah, don't worry about it.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.887
I could stay out here
all night with you.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.589
I've got Bugles. I've got Combos.

12:36.623 --> 12:37.758
I've got Chicken In A Biskit.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.926
Ooh, Chicken In A Biskit!

12:38.959 --> 12:40.494
Mom, you really don't need to be here.

12:41.695 --> 12:43.297
Look! There's a meteor!

12:43.330 --> 12:46.233
- Wow!
- No, wait. That's a plane.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.134
- A shooting star!
- Wow!

12:48.168 --> 12:50.269
Nope! Another plane.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.575
Is that Doris or Angela?

12:54.608 --> 12:55.976
It's probably an emergency.

12:56.009 --> 12:57.344
No time to take it, just go.

12:57.376 --> 12:58.744
Dane just put up more photos

12:58.778 --> 13:01.081
of him and your dad at the 1799 party.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.682
They're assembling muskets,

13:02.716 --> 13:04.784
cobbling shoes,
and churning butter together.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.352
That stuff's so cool.

13:06.385 --> 13:08.988
Your generation was so lucky
you got to do all that.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.460
Look at how your dad is smiling at Dane.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.028
Look at how much fun they're having.

13:15.061 --> 13:17.663
He should be having fun with me.

13:17.696 --> 13:19.131
You need to go down there and show him

13:19.164 --> 13:21.367
you are way more fun than Dane.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.202
- You think I should?
- Absolutely.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.639
You need to let Dane know
he's the third wheel.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.307
You know, somebody who wants
to hang out with a couple

13:28.341 --> 13:30.177
when the couple really
wants to be left alone.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.115
- I can take a hint.
- No, no, no! Not you!

13:55.268 --> 13:57.704
Hey, Katie. What are you doing here?

13:57.736 --> 14:02.308
I am reliving the past
with an eye towards the future.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.910
Oh, my God. Katie, thank you

14:03.943 --> 14:05.211
for paying attention
to the Guild's mission.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.214
Of course. I listen.

14:07.246 --> 14:08.481
Where's Dane?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.850
He's at the mead pong table.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.887
He's dominating. No one can beat him.

14:14.921 --> 14:16.089
He's so cool.

14:16.121 --> 14:18.091
You think dominating beer pong is cool?

14:18.124 --> 14:19.359
Great.

14:19.392 --> 14:20.661
I will be back.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.328
<i>I'm from Florida.</i>

14:22.361 --> 14:24.497
<i>They teach beer pong in school
as an elective.</i>

14:24.531 --> 14:25.935
<i>Hmm.</i>

14:27.200 --> 14:28.602
Hey.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.776
Hey, Katie, you made it. Great!

14:36.810 --> 14:39.780
We'll see how great you think
it is once your reign is over.

14:41.781 --> 14:43.050
Ye on.

14:50.050 --> 14:51.113
I'm dominating.

14:56.015 --> 14:57.866
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

14:57.891 --> 14:59.069
Drink! Drink!

15:04.169 --> 15:05.839
Suck a musket, Dane.

15:10.677 --> 15:13.747
Yeah! Whoo!

15:21.488 --> 15:23.345
Drink, drink, drink!

15:23.370 --> 15:25.292
Drink, drink, drink!

15:25.325 --> 15:29.821
Drink, drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink, drink!

15:42.475 --> 15:45.144
Yeah! In your face!

15:45.177 --> 15:46.413
C'mon, everybody...

15:46.446 --> 15:48.850
Dane sucks! Dane sucks!

15:48.936 --> 15:51.183
- Dane sucks! Dane sucks!
- Dane sucks! Dane sucks!

15:51.216 --> 15:53.285
- Dane sucks! Dane sucks!
- Dane sucks! Dane...

15:53.318 --> 15:55.755
Katie, could I speak to you
by the stocks, please?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.357
Yeah.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.328
How is this fun for you?

16:01.360 --> 16:04.130
It's not. My cellphone rang
during a re-enactment.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.365
It was the third time.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.267
I hate nerds so much.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.268
What was that all about?

16:09.302 --> 16:12.139
I don't want you doing all this
stuff with Dane every night.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.507
You encouraged me
to be friends with him.

16:13.539 --> 16:14.707
Well, that was stupid.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.276
And it takes up too much of your time.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.645
You're jealous.

16:18.677 --> 16:20.179
That's amazing.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.348
I should have gotten
a new friend years ago.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.218
I just... miss you.

16:25.250 --> 16:26.986
I wanted you to find a new friend,

16:27.019 --> 16:28.388
but not a new best friend.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
I'm supposed to be your best friend.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.459
Sweetie, I like Dane, but you
will always be my best friend.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.595
You're hands-down my favorite
person to do stuff with.

16:36.663 --> 16:38.230
- Really?
- Of course.

16:38.264 --> 16:40.167
I'm sorry I ever made you doubt that.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.169
And to prove it, I'll take
you out for a fun night.

16:42.201 --> 16:44.037
- I'd like that.
- Done.

16:44.070 --> 16:46.039
You know, next week is the unveiling

16:46.071 --> 16:47.474
of the Wesley Lyon headstone restoration

16:47.507 --> 16:48.542
at the Willowbrook Cemetery.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.710
You can do that with Dane.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.485
Could somebody give me a hand?!

17:06.592 --> 17:08.561
Hey, Chambers let me in.

17:11.964 --> 17:15.267
Please have Chambers
reassigned to the bowling alley...

17:15.300 --> 17:16.736
shoe rentals.

17:18.404 --> 17:20.373
Didn't know you had
an arcade in your basement.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.443
In the winter it's an ice-skating rink.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.578
Oh, yeah.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.613
So what you want?

17:27.646 --> 17:30.082
I just wanted to say I was sorry.

17:30.116 --> 17:32.719
I was mad because I thought
you blew me off.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.053
Why would you think that?

17:34.087 --> 17:35.522
Because when I saw you on that yacht

17:35.554 --> 17:37.923
I thought you lied to me
about being with your parents.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.761
And then I realized it
was just an old picture.

17:40.793 --> 17:43.129
Why'd you post that?

17:43.162 --> 17:45.264
Because instead of hanging out with me,

17:45.298 --> 17:47.367
my parents bailed to
go sailing with the son

17:47.399 --> 17:49.802
of Dubai's Minister of Foreign Affairs.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.938
They were with someone else's son.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.408
I just didn't want anyone to know.

17:55.440 --> 17:58.244
- Dude, that sucks.
- Yeah.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.212
I guess I just thought
you were sick of slumming it

18:00.245 --> 18:01.480
with your poor friend.

18:01.514 --> 18:02.948
What?

18:02.982 --> 18:05.252
Dude, that's never going to happen.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.119
I don't care how much money you have.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.788
- Really?
- Of course.

18:08.821 --> 18:11.056
Plus, we're the richest family
in Westport.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.059
Literally everyone is beneath me.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.966
Uh, how many tickets
do I need for that drone?

18:19.998 --> 18:21.433
How many tickets do you have?

18:21.466 --> 18:25.071
- Uh, 14.
- 14 tickets.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.606
Well done.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.977
I know it's kind of sad that
he's just giving me things

18:32.011 --> 18:35.514
that I already own...
but it's sadder for him, right?

18:35.548 --> 18:37.450
I'll answer that.

18:37.483 --> 18:38.819
It's sadder for me.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.486
See?

18:40.520 --> 18:41.955
Are we <i>bueno?</i>

18:41.987 --> 18:43.055
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

18:44.823 --> 18:46.192
All right, see you in a couple weeks.

18:46.225 --> 18:47.994
I'll be here.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.662
Is this, like, your full-time job?

18:49.696 --> 18:51.630
Ouch.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.834
Yes. Yes, it is.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.802
And I'm... I'm almost 50 years old.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.474
Go.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.377
Meatloaf, my fave!

19:04.409 --> 19:05.778
The only way this could be better

19:05.812 --> 19:07.379
is if your mom was here, too.

19:07.412 --> 19:09.849
I'm here, you dingbat!

19:09.882 --> 19:12.518
<i>Muy bonita</i>, Mrs. Otto!

19:12.552 --> 19:13.954
You also look really pretty.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.044
Thank you.

19:15.069 --> 19:17.523
I'm your father's date tonight.
We compromised.

19:17.556 --> 19:20.492
First we're gonna go
candle-making... yawn.

19:20.525 --> 19:21.861
Then we're gonna grab dinner

19:21.895 --> 19:24.364
and see The Rock's new movie... groan.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.700
If you don't want to fight
traffic, you can catch the 8:15

19:26.733 --> 19:28.335
at the theater in my basement.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.570
If you're in the mood for an
indie, theater two is showing...

19:30.602 --> 19:32.205
Shut up and eat, Cooper.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.239
That's the stuff.

19:34.773 --> 19:36.577
Here, let me get a picture.
Everyone together.

19:39.611 --> 19:41.348
Everybody smile.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.585
- Did you get it?
- Here, hold on.
