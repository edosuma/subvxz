[suspenseful music playing]

00:56.791 --> 00:58.416
We got these fuckers now.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.875
We're gonna lose comms in there. [sighs]

01:15.416 --> 01:16.291
[radio beeps]

01:16.375 --> 01:20.208
Raptor Base, this is Delta Zero Three.
We have positive ID on the hostage.

01:20.291 --> 01:21.958
[man on radio]
Delta Zero Three, understood.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.166
The status of hostage?

01:23.708 --> 01:24.541
Still breathing.

01:25.083 --> 01:26.916
We followed the insurgents
to a tunnel system.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.041
[man] Delta Zero Three, stand by.

01:29.125 --> 01:32.000
It's getting kinda late.
Maybe we should back trail and break camp.

01:32.083 --> 01:33.125
Wait till light.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.750
That hostage looked like
he was in pretty bad shape.

01:35.833 --> 01:37.125
[sighs]

01:37.208 --> 01:39.208
It's always fucking night in a cave.

01:39.291 --> 01:42.458
-Why are you such a pussy, Spence?
-Why are you such a dick, Dilman?

01:44.250 --> 01:45.333
Get ready to move.

01:47.375 --> 01:50.791
[man] Delta Zero Three,
secure hostage and proceed to exfil.

01:50.875 --> 01:53.708
[man 2] Received, Raptor Base.
Delta Zero Three, over.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.125
Beaumont, on point.

01:56.625 --> 01:58.291
One beam, no white light.

01:58.375 --> 01:59.458
Everyone, go goggles.

02:01.125 --> 02:03.458
Spence,
I want IR markers at 25-meter intervals.

02:03.541 --> 02:04.625
[Spencer] Roger that.

Oh, I feel like a fat, fucking target
of opportunity up here.

02:18.291 --> 02:21.666
Don't worry. I've got your back, donkey.

02:21.750 --> 02:23.250
[Beaumont] Stop calling me that.

02:23.333 --> 02:24.583
[Dilman] Okay, okay.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.958
Soon as you stop fucking donkeys.

02:27.041 --> 02:30.291
I told you, I was just petting it.
It was scared. What was I supposed to do?

02:30.375 --> 02:32.625
All right.
Cut the bullshit. We're on the job.

[suspenseful music swells]

02:49.125 --> 02:50.083
Weird shit, man.

02:50.166 --> 02:51.000
What is it?

02:52.458 --> 02:53.750
Some sort of lichen.

02:54.250 --> 02:57.916
-Is that normal in a cave?
-Fuck if I know. I'm from Rhode Island.

03:02.833 --> 03:04.375
[Beaumont] Sarge. Body.

03:05.458 --> 03:06.416

03:08.750 --> 03:10.000
-Set security.
-Roger.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.125
[Harper] A military-aged male.

03:14.333 --> 03:15.958
No discerning marks of trauma.

03:16.541 --> 03:17.625
[Beaumont] No trauma?

03:17.708 --> 03:19.375
Then where'd his fucking face go?

03:19.458 --> 03:20.458
[Sarge] The hostage.

03:22.083 --> 03:22.916
Goddammit.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.083
What the actual fuck?

03:25.583 --> 03:27.625
[man] Sarge, I got two more over here.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.333
[Sarge] These must be the insurgents.
Didn't we just see these guys?

03:31.416 --> 03:33.541
What kinda weapon
does that to a person, huh?

03:35.500 --> 03:36.833
Fuck this shit.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.791
Let's get this done. [exhales]

03:47.875 --> 03:50.250
[whispering] Sarge,
the hostage was the mission.

03:51.416 --> 03:52.708
We should take him home.

06:11.625 --> 06:12.875
I could have helped him.

06:12.958 --> 06:14.166
No. You couldn't have.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.791
The bugs aren't following us.

06:19.791 --> 06:21.500
They must only guard the tunnels.

Just this.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.458
[Harper breathing heavily]

09:31.000 --> 09:32.083
It's coming from…
