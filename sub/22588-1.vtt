00:42.439 --> 00:47.809
Thank you, dear peoples.
Thank you, everyone.

00:47.811 --> 00:49.010
'Now in conclusion.'

00:49.012 --> 00:53.482
On behalf of my country
Moldavia, land of charm

00:53.484 --> 00:58.186
is such pleasure to unveil
for you Moldavia's greatest

00:58.188 --> 01:01.990
national treasure
behind me on platform.

01:03.460 --> 01:07.996
But there is a small ceremony.

01:23.480 --> 01:28.917
It's traditional Moldavian
friendship cake, dear peoples.

01:28.919 --> 01:32.287
Which I'll now chop
for you in the name of..

01:40.564 --> 01:44.166
Hey look! Look what
shot from that cake.

01:54.044 --> 01:57.145
"Why is an orange like a bell?"

01:57.548 --> 02:00.282
You know what this
means, don't you?

02:00.284 --> 02:01.483
The Riddler.

02:01.485 --> 02:03.952
Right, Chief O'Hara,
The Riddler.

02:03.954 --> 02:05.120
That infernal prince of puzzlers

02:05.122 --> 02:08.423
who's outwitted
us a dozen times.

02:08.425 --> 02:11.426
What about it, men?
O'Hara?

02:11.428 --> 02:15.831
Inspector Basch? Any of
you think you can handle him?

02:27.978 --> 02:30.111
I don't know who
is behind that mask

02:30.113 --> 02:32.581
but I do know when
we need him.

02:32.583 --> 02:35.550
And we need him now.

02:46.997 --> 02:48.597
I'll call him, sir.

02:48.599 --> 02:50.432
We're in lucky, he's at home.

02:50.434 --> 02:53.401
My resources are
behind you in full.

02:53.403 --> 02:55.036
You're a real
champion, Mr. Wayne.

02:55.038 --> 02:57.973
- 'Indeed you are.'
- Don't mention it, Mr. Harris.

02:57.975 --> 02:59.474
'Perhaps, if there had
been anti-crime centers'

02:59.476 --> 03:02.410
of the type you now
propose when my own parents

03:02.412 --> 03:04.313
were murdered
by dastardly criminals..

03:05.650 --> 03:06.849
Yes, Alfred.

03:07.451 --> 03:10.385
The Bat-phone, sir.

03:10.921 --> 03:12.220
Forgive me,
I'm just reminded

03:12.222 --> 03:15.991
I'd promised to take my young
ward, Dick Grayson fishing.

03:15.993 --> 03:16.658
If you'll excuse me.

03:16.660 --> 03:18.927
It'll be a pleasure
working with you, sir.

03:18.929 --> 03:21.630
It's wonderful
knowing you're behind this.

03:21.632 --> 03:25.233
Oh, there you are, Dick.
Feel like a bit of fishing?

03:25.235 --> 03:28.970
Holy barracuda! You mean..

03:30.040 --> 03:33.041
Sure, Bruce.
Why not? Sounds swell.

03:33.043 --> 03:35.977
Doesn't it, Aunt Harriet?

03:40.918 --> 03:41.549
Yes, commissioner.

03:41.851 --> 03:44.552
You'll never guess who's
on the loose.

03:44.554 --> 03:47.322
Your old arch enemy,
The Riddler.

03:47.324 --> 03:48.890
- Good heavens!
- Him again?

03:48.892 --> 03:50.625
Can you come to
headquarters right away?

03:50.627 --> 03:54.329
It'll be a pleasure,
Commissioner Gordon.

Clear. Ready to move out.

05:46.411 --> 05:50.613
"Why is an orange like a bell?"

05:50.615 --> 05:52.615
Answer! Because they
both must be peeled!

05:52.617 --> 05:56.385
Right. You peel an orange
and you peal a bell. Get it?

05:56.387 --> 06:00.189
What idiots we are! Why couldn't
we have worked that out?

06:00.191 --> 06:01.724
But what does it mean, though?

06:01.726 --> 06:03.626
Right, commissioner.
There's a problem.

06:03.628 --> 06:06.328
We all know how this
quizzical criminal operates.

06:06.330 --> 06:09.465
He deliberately leaves
clues to confound us.

06:09.467 --> 06:13.436
Clues which may or may not lead
to the real crime he's planning.

06:13.438 --> 06:16.405
- The real crime?
- Precisely, Inspector Basch.

06:16.407 --> 06:19.809
The Riddler contrives
his plots like artichokes.

06:19.811 --> 06:23.612
You have to strip off spiny
leaves to reach the heart.

06:23.614 --> 06:26.482
But surely, Batman,
there must be some sort of

06:26.484 --> 06:27.550
political plot against Moldavia.

06:27.552 --> 06:30.486
- That exploding cake--
- A mere ruse, commissioner.

06:30.488 --> 06:33.856
A clever device to
make you call me in.

06:33.858 --> 06:36.459
But why?
Why would he want that?

06:36.461 --> 06:38.094
You're his deadly nemesis.

06:38.096 --> 06:39.228
The Riddler's mind is twisted.

06:39.230 --> 06:42.631
Crime's no fun for him
unless it means outwitting us.

06:42.633 --> 06:43.866
Robin's right.

06:43.868 --> 06:48.437
He has this strange,
artistic compulsion to..

06:49.273 --> 06:51.240
Artistic. That's it.

06:51.242 --> 06:53.209
The meaning
of the first clue.

06:53.211 --> 06:54.376
The Peale Art Gallery.

06:54.378 --> 06:57.313
Of course! It's a store house
of priceless art treasures.

06:57.315 --> 06:59.448
- Just The Riddler's meat.
- Call out your boys, chief.

06:59.450 --> 07:03.552
Stakeout that Peale Art Gallery
like you would a circus tent.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.354
Yes, sir.

07:06.624 --> 07:08.190
'Not so fast, men. Wait.'

07:08.192 --> 07:10.693
The Riddler's up to
something tricky.

07:10.695 --> 07:13.329
Better let us handle this.

07:13.331 --> 07:15.898
It smells like a trap.

07:31.482 --> 07:34.450
Let's mosey up the back way.

07:40.491 --> 07:41.624
Batman speaking.

07:44.228 --> 07:45.895
'This is a recording.'

07:45.897 --> 07:49.765
'Before you trip over your
cape, Batman, riddle me this.'

07:49.767 --> 07:53.469
'There are three men in
a boat with four cigarettes'

07:53.471 --> 07:54.703
'but no matches.'

07:54.705 --> 07:58.774
'How do they manage
to smoke, hm?'

08:03.514 --> 08:04.346
The Riddler.

08:04.348 --> 08:06.749
What the heck's
he trying to tell us?

08:06.751 --> 08:08.918
I don't know.

08:09.787 --> 08:12.588
Let's go up and ask him.

08:19.597 --> 08:21.530
Stand clear.

08:26.837 --> 08:30.206
- You go first. I'll anchor you.
- Roger.

08:30.741 --> 08:33.909
Gosh, if I could just
figure out that riddle.

08:33.910 --> 08:35.344
Why can't I get it?

08:35.346 --> 08:37.613
Maybe your mind's on
that cute little teenager

08:37.615 --> 08:40.448
who waved to you on
the way across town.

08:40.451 --> 08:42.618
Aw, come on, Batman.

08:49.427 --> 08:51.727
Caught him red-handed.

09:27.398 --> 09:30.466
Watch it, chump.
Pedestrian safety.

09:30.468 --> 09:32.801
Oh, sure. Sorry.

09:53.491 --> 09:55.924
Hold it, Riddler.

10:04.969 --> 10:06.335
The game's up, Riddler.

10:06.337 --> 10:08.037
As a duly deputized
agent of the law

10:08.039 --> 10:10.472
'I place you under
arrest for armed robbery.'

10:10.474 --> 10:14.510
- Snap on the Bat-cuffs.
- You've got me, Batman.

10:18.416 --> 10:19.048
What the..

10:19.050 --> 10:21.483
It's too delicious.

10:21.485 --> 10:22.451
I even gave you a tip-off.

10:22.453 --> 10:27.356
Batman, you've made a mistake.
He didn't steal that cross.

10:27.358 --> 10:27.723
What?

10:27.725 --> 10:29.591
I tell you, it belongs to him.

10:29.593 --> 10:30.826
He lent it to me for a show.

10:30.828 --> 10:35.497
But, Mr. Peale, we saw him
take it from you at gunpoint.

10:35.499 --> 10:37.066
Gunpoint?

10:40.471 --> 10:42.905
Holy Ashtray! He did tip us off.

10:45.476 --> 10:46.975
"There were three men in a boat

10:46.977 --> 10:49.578
"with four cigarettes
and no matches.

10:49.580 --> 10:52.014
How did they manage to smoke?"

10:52.483 --> 10:54.049
They threw one
cigarette overboard

10:54.051 --> 10:55.484
and made the boat
a cigarette lighter.

10:55.486 --> 11:00.589
You saw him giving me a light
as I handed back his cross.

11:00.591 --> 11:01.690
Out riddled!

11:01.692 --> 11:03.025
I thought you might be, Batman.

11:03.027 --> 11:05.861
That's why I brought
witnesses with cameras. Ho-ho!

11:05.863 --> 11:11.133
What is it that no man wants to
have yet no man wants to lose?

11:11.135 --> 11:12.101
A lawsuit.

11:12.103 --> 11:14.970
Correct, Boy Wonder!

11:24.448 --> 11:26.915
How I've waited for this?

11:26.917 --> 11:31.387
It makes my whole
life worthwhile.

11:35.593 --> 11:38.761
After you've chewed
over this for a while

11:38.763 --> 11:40.696
look for two more.

11:40.698 --> 11:42.464
<i> Adios, amigos.</i>

11:42.466 --> 11:44.566
See you in court.

12:01.853 --> 12:04.087
'According to legal experts'

12:04.089 --> 12:05.422
'the one million dollar lawsuit'

12:05.424 --> 12:07.123
'filed this morning
against Batman'

12:07.125 --> 12:10.627
for assault, slander
and false arrest

12:10.629 --> 12:14.631
appears to have every
chance of success.

12:14.633 --> 12:18.134
'Causing even greater dismay
in law enforcement circles'

12:18.136 --> 12:20.937
'is the fact that
Batman will undoubtedly'

12:20.939 --> 12:24.541
have to reveal his
true identity in court.

12:24.543 --> 12:26.743
- 'Once unmasked it is feared..'
- Dick.

12:26.745 --> 12:27.210
Turn it off.

12:27.212 --> 12:28.845
'...no longer
will the Caped Crusader'

12:28.847 --> 12:34.551
'and his youthful aid be able
to combat crime in Gotham City.'

12:35.787 --> 12:37.053
Find anything?

12:37.055 --> 12:38.521
Looks black as pitch, Dick.

12:38.523 --> 12:41.858
I've been through all
my father's old law books..

12:41.860 --> 12:45.128
...I don't see we
have a leg to stand on.

12:45.130 --> 12:47.130
A million dollars.

12:47.132 --> 12:51.201
It's not the money, Alfred.
It's the idea of it.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.102
'My identity revealed.'

12:53.104 --> 12:56.105
My value as a secret
crime-fighter ended.

12:56.107 --> 12:58.174
Everything I've
trained myself for

12:58.176 --> 13:01.010
since my parents were murdered

13:01.012 --> 13:03.012
in the ashcan.

13:03.014 --> 13:04.013
Gone.

13:04.015 --> 13:04.948
Up the shoot.

13:04.950 --> 13:08.952
Well, sir, I do hope
something can be worked out.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.154
If poor Mrs. Cooper
were to find out

13:11.156 --> 13:13.656
what Master Dick
has been doing on these

13:13.658 --> 13:16.960
supposed fishing
trips of yours..

13:33.178 --> 13:36.145
Listen, Bruce.
I have an idea.

13:36.147 --> 13:36.746
Yes.

13:36.748 --> 13:38.181
Remember what the Riddler said

13:38.183 --> 13:39.582
when he slipped you this paper?

13:39.584 --> 13:42.585
'"When you chewed over this
one, look for two others."'

13:42.587 --> 13:46.823
- What do you guess he meant?
- Two other riddles, of course.

13:46.825 --> 13:47.957
Exactly.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.925
And where can we look?

13:48.927 --> 13:52.729
What do we have with us
which The Riddler gave us?

13:52.731 --> 13:54.564
Great Scott, Dick!

13:55.767 --> 13:59.702
Could there be secret
writing on this document?

14:00.305 --> 14:02.138
To the Bat-cave.

14:14.986 --> 14:16.953
Look between the lines.

14:16.955 --> 14:22.592
"When is the time of a clock
like the whistle of a train?"

14:22.594 --> 14:24.694
When it's two to two.

14:24.696 --> 14:27.597
- Too-too-too!
- Right you are.

14:27.799 --> 14:29.566
Here comes another one.

14:29.568 --> 14:34.637
"What has neither
flesh, bone...nor nail

14:34.639 --> 14:39.776
yet has four
fingers and...a thumb?"

14:39.778 --> 14:42.278
- A glove, of course!
- Could it be an address?

14:42.280 --> 14:45.148
I've got it.
222, Glover Avenue.

14:45.150 --> 14:46.249
You've done it again, chump.

14:46.251 --> 14:48.818
Let's just hope
we're not too late.

14:59.764 --> 15:03.766
<i> Meanwhile, in an abandoned</i>
<i> subway toolroom</i>

15:03.768 --> 15:04.667
<i> deep under Gotham City</i>

15:04.669 --> 15:09.238
<i> the secret headquarters</i>
<i> of the infamous Molehill Mob.</i>

15:15.213 --> 15:16.346
Watch them fish eggs, Molly.

15:16.348 --> 15:19.382
They're full of calories.
You'll blow up like a balloon.

15:19.384 --> 15:22.218
- Who cares? I'm hungry.
- I care.

15:22.220 --> 15:25.955
Get fat, you won't be able
to get through the manholes.

15:25.957 --> 15:28.057
Then what use you'd be?

15:30.095 --> 15:32.762
Get up, stop that
ridiculous bickering.

15:32.764 --> 15:36.099
Batman's had time
to solve the clue.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.337
Hurry, into the tunnel.

15:43.942 --> 15:45.975
<i> What foul trickery</i>
<i> are the fiendish</i>

15:45.977 --> 15:50.179
<i> Riddler and his evil</i>
<i> Molehill Mob up to now?</i>

16:10.802 --> 16:12.335
Odd, the new discotheque?

16:12.337 --> 16:15.138
What's The Riddler's game?
Hold up the wealthy patrons?

16:15.140 --> 16:19.042
Could be. It's a favorite
haunt of high society.

16:19.344 --> 16:23.780
Sorry, Batman. I'm afraid
the boy is underage.

16:24.349 --> 16:26.182
It's the law.

16:26.184 --> 16:29.419
Very odd. This could be
a plot to separate us.

16:29.421 --> 16:33.423
I can take care of
myself, Batman. You go inside.

16:33.425 --> 16:37.093
I'll pull into the lot
and watch in the Bat-scope.

16:37.095 --> 16:38.461
Alright.

16:40.198 --> 16:42.832
Thanks, Robin will take it.

17:23.875 --> 17:27.109
Gleeps! It's Batman.

17:28.346 --> 17:32.782
Anything I can do
for you, sir? Check your cape?

17:34.786 --> 17:36.052
Ringside table, Batman?

17:36.054 --> 17:38.521
Uh, just looking, thanks.
I'll stand at the bar.

17:38.523 --> 17:42.325
I shouldn't wish
to attract attention.

17:59.210 --> 18:01.377
A large fresh
orange juice, please.

18:01.379 --> 18:02.812
Yes, sir.

18:02.814 --> 18:05.214
Looking for a friend?

18:05.450 --> 18:10.153
Maybe you can help me.
I've got a problem.

18:10.155 --> 18:12.088
Why is a quarrel like a bargain?

18:12.090 --> 18:15.424
Well, well. What master
taught you to riddle?

18:15.426 --> 18:19.428
The answer is it
takes two to make it.

18:19.430 --> 18:24.200
Like beautiful music,
like the dance.

18:26.838 --> 18:27.937
Shall we?

18:27.939 --> 18:32.041
Your orange juice, sir.
Batman special.

18:43.354 --> 18:45.388
What's your name?

18:45.390 --> 18:46.389
Molly.

18:46.391 --> 18:49.225
You interest me, strangely.

18:49.828 --> 18:52.495
'I accept your invitation.'

19:27.899 --> 19:31.100
You shake
a pretty mean cape, Batman.

19:31.102 --> 19:33.636
It's nothing, it's..

19:38.509 --> 19:40.443
Yes.

19:41.412 --> 19:42.945
Yes.

19:42.947 --> 19:44.180
Well, I..

19:44.182 --> 19:46.549
My, my drink..

19:46.551 --> 19:47.550
Doped!

20:19.550 --> 20:21.217
I'll take the Batmobile too.

20:21.219 --> 20:25.488
- What about Molly and me?
- The manhole, stupid.

20:51.215 --> 20:52.715
That thing's alive.

20:52.717 --> 20:56.252
Every copper in town
will see them fireworks.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.628
Quickly, the kid.
Grab the kid.

21:20.445 --> 21:25.548
If I can't take the dratted
thing, I'll...burn it up!

21:49.474 --> 21:54.677
Curses! This got
more lives than a cat!

21:55.013 --> 21:56.746
Come on!

22:08.659 --> 22:13.596
Officers, out of
my way. They've got Robin.

22:16.467 --> 22:20.302
Out of my way I said.
I've got to go after Robin.

22:20.304 --> 22:24.607
Hand me the key, Batman.
You're in no condition to drive.

22:25.543 --> 22:28.344
Yes, of course, Officer.

22:28.513 --> 22:32.048
You're entirely correct.

22:33.484 --> 22:37.319
Look. The Bat-signal
from the roof of City Hall.

22:37.321 --> 22:40.456
The commissioner's
trying to call Batman.

22:47.265 --> 22:51.200
In his shape,
kinder not tell him.

22:51.536 --> 22:55.371
Where have they got Robin?

23:01.446 --> 23:04.848
Put him on a table
and strap him down.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.580
Mol.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.616
Yes, doctor.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.085
At last.

23:41.087 --> 23:45.423
At last, Boy Wonder Robin.

23:52.631 --> 23:54.798
At last, Boy Wonder Robin.

23:54.800 --> 23:58.168
You and the Caped Crusader

23:58.170 --> 24:01.205
both...are set

24:01.841 --> 24:04.908
for the final bow.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.744
<i> Will Robin escape?</i>

24:09.281 --> 24:12.282
<i> Can Batman find him in time?</i>

24:12.284 --> 24:16.219
<i> Is this the</i> ghastly
end <i> for our Dynamic Duo?</i>

24:16.221 --> 24:18.055
<i> Answers tomorrow night!</i>

24:18.057 --> 24:20.657
<i> Same time, same channel.</i>

24:20.659 --> 24:21.591
<i> One hint</i>

24:21.593 --> 24:24.127
<i> the worst is yet to come.</i>
