00:01.210 --> 00:06.173
Well, I don't know why
they need you in the studio.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.841
Surprise!

00:08.007 --> 00:11.136
Oh, my God!
Is this for me?

00:11.303 --> 00:15.015
I can't believe you made all
this fuss over my birthday.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.434
It's so incredibly thoughtful.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.853
Let me give something
back to you guys.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.690
* I believe the children are our future *

00:23.857 --> 00:26.568
* Teach them well and
let them lead the way *

00:26.736 --> 00:29.690
Hey, guess what, everyone?
I'm engaged.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.320
Engaged?

00:33.037 --> 00:36.783
Hey, this isn't gonna change the way
you dress or eat lollipops, is it?

00:36.959 --> 00:37.452
No.

00:37.629 --> 00:40.081
Oh, then congratulations.

00:40.246 --> 00:42.502
This is for you, Cerie.

00:42.667 --> 00:46.210
* I believe the children are our future *

00:46.386 --> 00:50.053
* Teach them well and
let them lead the way *

00:50.217 --> 00:50.803
* Show them...

00:50.968 --> 00:52.673
* All the beauty they possess... *

00:52.847 --> 00:53.761
Everyone, guess what?

00:53.926 --> 00:58.641
There's an antique car
show out in the plaza!

01:05.607 --> 01:06.901
How long is Jack gonna be?

01:07.065 --> 01:09.311
He's still on the phone.

01:09.488 --> 01:12.190
Area code 407?
Oh, no.

01:12.366 --> 01:13.031
When did this happen?

01:13.198 --> 01:14.652
407? Is that bad?

01:14.826 --> 01:18.910
It's fine.
It's gonna be just fine.

01:19.836 --> 01:23.450
Jonathan, these cheap phones
keep on shattering!

01:23.626 --> 01:25.122
You can go in now.

01:25.296 --> 01:27.462
No.

01:29.468 --> 01:33.170
Who let 407 through?
Jonathan, we have drills for this!

01:33.347 --> 01:34.381
Liz distracted me.

01:34.558 --> 01:36.381
No, I didn't.

01:36.556 --> 01:38.303
What's going on?
Business got you down?

01:38.477 --> 01:41.183
Business doesn't get me down.
Business gets me off.

01:41.357 --> 01:44.563
Now, what is your urgent
problem this time?

01:44.735 --> 01:49.731
Well, the writers and I wanted to get TGS jackets,
but the guy in accounting says
that we can't have the jackets.

01:49.907 --> 01:51.153
But Dateline has jackets.

01:51.327 --> 01:54.281
Jackets?
Is this what you're talking about now?

01:54.445 --> 01:54.903
Jackets?

01:55.075 --> 02:00.621
Lemon, do you realize that your little show accounts for
3% of our revenue but takes up 90% of my time?

02:00.785 --> 02:02.280
Hello?!

02:02.458 --> 02:05.663
Now, would you do me a kindness, please?

02:05.835 --> 02:08.961
And handle your problems yourself
and stop bothering me.

02:09.126 --> 02:11.133
Is that too much to ask?

02:11.296 --> 02:12.540
Absolutely!
Forget it.

02:12.717 --> 02:17.222
I won't bother you
about anything anymore.

02:29.448 --> 02:31.521
Wow, he's a little bit of
a stress eater, huh?

02:31.698 --> 02:34.192
He puts up with so much.

02:34.366 --> 02:36.940
All right.

02:59.306 --> 03:02.641
Liz, you shoulda seen this guy
at the club last night.

03:02.808 --> 03:05.602
Everybody at this party is a Jedi.

03:05.767 --> 03:09.641
We must get our freak on
while our fruit is a-plentiful.

03:09.818 --> 03:11.440
Oh, naw!

03:11.607 --> 03:15.520
Oh, sounds like another great party
I wasn't invited to.

03:15.696 --> 03:19.241
Tracy, thank you for
the funnest night of my life!

03:19.406 --> 03:20.150
Love you, man.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.991
I love you too, J Bird!

03:23.168 --> 03:24.740
Yo, I don't like that dude.

03:24.918 --> 03:26.953
It's disrespectful
when he imitates me.

03:27.126 --> 03:28.580
I want him fired.

03:28.756 --> 03:32.213
Oh, come on, it's a goof.

03:32.377 --> 03:35.003
How would you like it if
I did an impression of you, Liz Lemon?

03:35.176 --> 03:37.172
Hi, I'm Liz Lemon!

03:37.345 --> 03:41.222
I like to wear man shirts.
Watch me skateboard.

03:41.385 --> 03:42.510
I don't skateboard.

03:42.686 --> 03:44.180
Hurts, doesn't it?

03:44.346 --> 03:46.183
I'm not firing Josh.

03:46.358 --> 03:49.852
You always take his side.

03:50.648 --> 03:53.021
Tracy, stop tasering him.

03:53.195 --> 03:53.771
See?

03:53.948 --> 03:55.442
I need to be respected, Liz Lemon.

03:55.615 --> 03:56.903
What do you know about respect?

03:57.076 --> 03:58.780
Please, Tracy, just let it go.

03:58.947 --> 04:02.781
Well, if you won't do anything about it,
then I'll just go over your head to Donaghy.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.122
No, no no, do not do that.
Don't bother him.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.373
I'll talk to Josh.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.543
Hey, Cerie, what are you doing?

04:14.718 --> 04:17.882
Oh,  I let them do my make-up sometimes.
They say it's fun for them.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.423
She's like a Barbie.

04:19.596 --> 04:25.972
Oh, sorry, my babysitter got jury duty.
I think I'm going to kill myself.

04:27.727 --> 04:31.391
So, Cerie, how long have you known this guy
that you're marrying?

04:31.565 --> 04:33.191
It'll be two months in...

04:33.357 --> 04:34.482
three weeks.

04:34.657 --> 04:37.191
You'd love him, Liz.
He's so funny.

04:37.366 --> 04:40.230
He does this thing
where he screams at limo drivers.

04:40.407 --> 04:45.163
Yeah, it just kind of seems like
you're rushing into it a little bit.

04:45.325 --> 04:45.743
I guess.

04:45.918 --> 04:48.491
But we both wanna have babies
while it's still cool.

04:48.668 --> 04:50.370
I already have
all the names picked out.

04:50.546 --> 04:55.042
If it's a girl, Bookcase.
Or Sandstorm. Or maybe Hat.

04:55.218 --> 04:56.422
But that's more of a boy's name.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.293
Yeah, I was gonna say.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.842
It's just, you're so young, Cerie.
There's no big hurry to have babies.

05:03.017 --> 05:07.513
I mean, there are other things in life.
Like having a career. And working.

05:07.687 --> 05:11.521
And...having a job.
And working.

05:11.687 --> 05:13.483
You can have a career anytime.

05:13.647 --> 05:17.313
But you only have a really short period
where you can be a young, hot mom.

05:17.488 --> 05:19.691
If you wait too long,
you could be like...

05:19.866 --> 05:22.072
50 at your kid's graduation.

05:22.238 --> 05:25.071
50's not that old, Cerie.

05:25.247 --> 05:29.032
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you 50 now?

05:31.127 --> 05:33.913
Paul Newman or Robert Redford?

05:34.088 --> 05:36.292
I've told you 1,000 times, Newman.

05:36.467 --> 05:38.581
Because I enjoy his
salad dressings and lemonade.

05:38.757 --> 05:39.840
Me too.

05:40.008 --> 05:44.462
Okay, uh, Brad Pitt...
or George Clooney?

05:45.556 --> 05:47.012
Do you think
I'd be a good mother?

05:47.188 --> 05:47.843
What?

05:48.016 --> 05:49.010
Something is kicking in.

05:49.187 --> 05:53.643
And the last few months
I've just started wondering
if I'm ever gonna have a baby.

05:53.815 --> 05:56.562
I mean, I'm so many steps away
from being able to do it.

05:56.737 --> 05:58.733
And I panic that maybe
I waited too long.

05:58.905 --> 06:03.571
What if my junk goes bad?
What if Cerie is right?

06:03.735 --> 06:05.691
Wow, red wine is not your drink.

06:05.868 --> 06:07.530
I'm sorry.
I'm in my right mind.

06:07.707 --> 06:09.532
I just--it comes in waves, you know?

06:09.705 --> 06:12.583
And I love my job
and I love my friends.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.412
And if I am meant to crank out a kid,
then I have plenty of time.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.040
Uh, not really.

06:19.217 --> 06:20.001
Jenna! 

06:20.175 --> 06:20.881
No, Liz, I'm just saying.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.211
If this is something you really want,
let's go for it.

06:23.387 --> 06:23.923
I'll help you.

06:24.095 --> 06:27.341
Please, let me help you for once.
We'll get you a guy.

06:27.516 --> 06:30.182
Like that hot dancer
Madonna used to have Lourdes.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.513
No  no no.
That is not how I roll.

06:32.687 --> 06:36.063
Forget I said anything.

06:36.278 --> 06:37.562
Because you agreed to this.

06:37.738 --> 06:41.270
I did not make you sign anything.
I will not be intimidated by you!

06:41.448 --> 06:42.271
Good  morning, Mr. Donaghy!

06:42.447 --> 06:43.111
Go to hell.

06:43.277 --> 06:46.111
No, thank you.

06:51.808 --> 06:53.830
Kenneth, I'm sorry.
How do you do it, Kenneth?

06:53.995 --> 06:58.462
How do you sit here every day
taking crap from people and you keep smiling?

06:58.627 --> 07:01.632
My mother always told me
that even when things seemed bad...

07:01.797 --> 07:04.091
there's someone else
who's having a worse day.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.342
Like being stung by a bee
or getting a splinter.

07:07.518 --> 07:10.842
Or being chained to a wall
in someone's sex dungeon.

07:11.018 --> 07:12.801
Isn't that a kick in
the soft stuff, Kenneth?

07:12.976 --> 07:16.722
I mean, you gain strength from your mother
while mine is sucking the life out of me.

07:16.896 --> 07:18.560
She calls me constantly. That was her.

07:18.736 --> 07:19.600
That was her.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.651
Complaining about where she's living.
Threatening to move in with me.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.693
Oh, how wonderful.

07:23.869 --> 07:28.242
No no no, that's not wonderful.
I run companies. Plural.

07:28.409 --> 07:29.321
But to that woman...

07:29.497 --> 07:33.030
I'm always gonna be the punk kid who cried
when Pop was run over by a mail truck.

07:33.205 --> 07:35.082
Oh my, a mailman killed your dad?

07:35.248 --> 07:35.952
No, Pop was my dog.

07:36.125 --> 07:40.371
My dad left when I was two...
so I grew up calling my Collie Pop.

07:40.546 --> 07:43.213
My mother is my best friend.

07:43.387 --> 07:46.800
My mother tried to send me to Vietnam
to make a man out of me.

07:46.965 --> 07:48.461
I was 12.

07:48.637 --> 07:50.760
Well, my mother has her dark times too.

07:50.926 --> 07:55.100
But that's when I tell her,
"Mama, you carried me for nine months.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.603
Let me carry you now."

07:59.568 --> 08:02.312
You are a remarkable human being, Kenneth.

08:02.487 --> 08:06.361
I bought my mother a lovely
retirement home. In Florida.

08:06.526 --> 08:09.990
With a tea garden and fake rocks made of foam
because she falls down a lot.

08:10.156 --> 08:12.152
Got everything
she needs except a phone.

08:12.327 --> 08:18.043
I told those people, I made it clear,
do not give her a phone.

08:19.167 --> 08:22.712
It's her.
It's always her.

08:27.296 --> 08:29.672
Hello?

08:35.767 --> 08:37.681
This is Dr. Leo Spaceman.

08:37.857 --> 08:39.813
Oh, hi, I'm sorry.

08:39.976 --> 08:42.812
I got this number under fertility
in the Writer's Guild Health Manual.

08:42.988 --> 08:46.611
I'm also listed under meth addiction
and child psychiatry.

08:46.778 --> 08:48.022
So what can I help you with?

08:48.198 --> 08:52.821
I should start by saying that
I can't personally help you conceive.

08:52.998 --> 08:57.322
Something happened to me
while scuba diving.

08:57.498 --> 09:00.701
Hey, so Jenna tells us
you're looking for a babydaddy.

09:00.878 --> 09:01.870
She what?

09:02.045 --> 09:04.251
Yeah. So?

09:04.415 --> 09:06.711
So...

09:07.297 --> 09:08.383
Are you kidding me?

09:08.548 --> 09:10.923
Now, okay, before you say no...
I just wanna say...

09:11.095 --> 09:13.173
our child would have a leg up
getting into Harvard.

09:13.347 --> 09:14.683
Oh, really?
Did you go to Harvard?

09:14.848 --> 09:16.932
'Cause you haven't mentioned it
in like three hours.

09:17.095 --> 09:19.763
Our kid would have strong, flat feet.

09:19.938 --> 09:22.772
And if you choose me,
I agree not to take my shirt off.

09:22.936 --> 09:24.522
But I do like to get yelled
at during sex.

09:24.696 --> 09:25.602
You're disgusting.

09:25.778 --> 09:27.773
Yeah, that's a good start.

09:27.948 --> 09:28.902
Ugh.

09:29.067 --> 09:29.733
Get out of here.

09:29.908 --> 09:32.943
Jenna had no business
telling you guys that.

09:33.116 --> 09:35.702
Oh, hey, blue pages.
What? What's wrong?

09:35.868 --> 09:39.372
Jenna told the writers that I'm looking for
a guy to get me pregnant.

09:39.537 --> 09:40.331
Can you believe her?

09:40.498 --> 09:42.040
I know.
It's so uncool.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.751
I mean, why would she go to them?
Who do you know better than me?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.581
Oh, come on.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.082
Didn't you have a vasectomy?

09:48.257 --> 09:49.543
No, I just told my wife I did.

09:49.717 --> 09:51.133
And she doesn't get pregnant how?

09:51.305 --> 09:53.880
I fake it.

09:54.056 --> 09:55.223
Is Jenna out here?
Is she rehearsing?

09:55.385 --> 09:56.680
She's onstage.

09:56.848 --> 09:58.761
Excuse me, Ms. Lemon?

09:58.937 --> 09:59.933
Uh...

10:00.105 --> 10:05.890
I'm not usually this formal, nor this bold,
but I figure time is on neither one of our sides.

10:06.068 --> 10:08.480
Uh, could you excuse us for a second?

10:08.655 --> 10:10.612
I'd kind of like him to stay.

10:10.775 --> 10:12.113
Very well.

10:12.275 --> 10:15.151
Ms. Lemon... Liz...

10:15.325 --> 10:18.032
I'd  like to carry your child
if I might.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.953
I have a small ferret farm
about 60 miles north of the city.

10:21.125 --> 10:22.991
It's not much,
but it is self-sufficient.

10:23.166 --> 10:26.912
I can get cable if you want,
'cause I know how much you like the TV.

10:27.085 --> 10:31.133
Sometimes I watch you watching it.

10:34.007 --> 10:35.670
Think about it.

10:35.847 --> 10:37.671
Jenna.

10:37.847 --> 10:41.011
Stop telling everyone
I need someone to get me pregnant.

10:41.188 --> 10:44.680
I'm not telling everyone.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.150
All right, guys, check this out.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.940
Oprah and Steadman are the same person.

10:53.115 --> 10:53.733
You know what?

10:53.905 --> 10:55.281
I don't have time for this conversation.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.861
I don't have time for anything.

10:57.037 --> 10:59.863
That's why he/she won't run for president.

11:00.037 --> 11:01.872
Hey, you gotta stop doing that impression.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.161
Tracy hates it.

11:03.338 --> 11:04.872
What? But it's funny.

11:05.048 --> 11:06.621
These guys like it.

11:06.795 --> 11:12.421
The Mars probe didn't brake.
It was attacked by a Martian cougar.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.382
This is how you take care
of things, Liz Lemon?

11:15.558 --> 11:16.763
I'm going to Jack Donaghy.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.343
No, no Tracy, please don't do that.

11:18.515 --> 11:21.133
Too late. This is untoward.

11:21.307 --> 11:24.433
This is not toward!

11:26.278 --> 11:27.682
You better fix this, nerd.

11:27.856 --> 11:30.852
Otherwise, Jack Donaghy is gonna kill me
and then he's gonna kill you.

11:31.026 --> 11:33.813
And then he's gonna fold us up
in a pizza and eat us.

11:33.988 --> 11:34.692
What?

11:34.868 --> 11:35.521
Hey Liz!

11:35.695 --> 11:37.480
I heard you're looking for a hook-up.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.491
Oh, you know what?

11:39.656 --> 11:42.071
Everybody, stop working right now!

11:42.248 --> 11:45.082
I don't wanna have sex with any of you.

11:45.247 --> 11:51.793
I have plenty of time to have a baby.
And I am not looking for sperm donors.

11:54.048 --> 11:55.671
Okay.

11:55.847 --> 11:59.883
But do you still want a sound hook-up
so you can listen to rehearsal?

12:00.055 --> 12:02.841
Yeah, thanks.

12:03.228 --> 12:06.392
How are you, Bobby? Good?

12:06.567 --> 12:08.933
Great.

12:17.828 --> 12:18.281
Yo!

12:18.448 --> 12:19.482
Tracy. It's Jack Donaghy.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.072
I hear we have a problem
with Josh Gerard.

12:21.247 --> 12:23.570
Damn right!
Keeps impersonating me.

12:23.746 --> 12:25.372
Making me into a caricature.

12:25.535 --> 12:27.990
Well, I would take care of this if I could.

12:28.168 --> 12:28.993
But it's tricky.

12:29.168 --> 12:31.910
You see, Josh's father's an assassin
with the Russian mafia.

12:32.087 --> 12:34.173
They call him El Matador.

12:34.335 --> 12:36.463
Whoa. Those dudes are crazy.

12:36.635 --> 12:38.672
Forget it, I don't need any of that noise.

12:38.846 --> 12:41.011
It happys me to hear you say that.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.551
For being so understanding.

12:42.725 --> 12:46.183
I'm sending you our new super
top secret invisible motorcycle.

12:46.355 --> 12:47.353
For reals?

12:47.518 --> 12:48.970
[laughing] For realses.

12:49.148 --> 12:51.271
Now, if you'll excuse me, 
I need to see a doctor.

12:51.436 --> 12:54.981
I keep pooping during sex.

12:58.155 --> 12:59.533
Lemon, we have a problem.

12:59.695 --> 13:02.193
I have this whole Tracy/Josh
thing under control.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.403
What are you talking about?

13:03.578 --> 13:05.822
Nothing. What are you talking about?

13:05.997 --> 13:09.700
You. You yelling at the crew.
You trolling for seed.

13:09.876 --> 13:12.290
Oh, it's a big misunderstanding.

13:12.455 --> 13:14.671
Jenna thinks
that I want to have a baby.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.883
I  should have known this was going to be a problem
when I decided to mentor a woman.

13:18.048 --> 13:22.130
No, in fact, what I said was
that my body is trying to make me think
I wanna have a baby.

13:22.306 --> 13:25.180
But my body is not the boss of me.
My brain is.

13:25.347 --> 13:28.722
All right, if you insist upon
going all Murphy Brown on me,
let me give you a tip.

13:28.906 --> 13:32.432
Don't smother your child with affection
to compensate for not having a man in your life.

13:32.606 --> 13:35.231
Don't say you're the only man I'll ever love.
Even babies know that's creepy.

13:35.397 --> 13:35.982
Of course.

13:36.147 --> 13:38.653
Don't put little notes in their lunch bag
that say, "Mommy's watching you."

13:38.818 --> 13:39.771
People find those things.

13:39.948 --> 13:41.023
I bet you behaved yourself, though.

13:41.198 --> 13:47.360
If your child is a terrific hockey player
and a gifted flautist, don't make them
play the National Anthem on the flute in front of their teammates.

13:47.538 --> 13:48.910
Your mother did that?

13:49.075 --> 13:51.490
Now she wants to move in with me.

13:51.667 --> 13:52.662
I can't have that, Lemon.

13:52.836 --> 13:56.503
Then be an adult and call her
and say you love her very much.

13:56.676 --> 13:58.253
But that living together is
not going to work for you.

13:58.428 --> 14:01.130
Oh, no. You don't know my mother.

14:01.305 --> 14:05.591
This is a woman that actually had a heart attack
to prevent me from going on my honeymoon.

14:05.768 --> 14:10.300
Maybe her heart broke because she spent 20 years
raising you and you're a total ingrate.

14:10.478 --> 14:12.350
That's exactly what she said.

14:12.516 --> 14:16.941
Is this what you want, Lemon,
to breathe life into another human being

14:17.106 --> 14:20.192
just to spend the rest of your days
slowly sucking it out of them?

14:20.366 --> 14:24.532
No, that's why my brain is the boss.

14:26.406 --> 14:27.572
Speak of the devil.

14:27.746 --> 14:31.122
Take a breath.
Be nice.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.580
Hello, Mother.
So nice to hear your voice.

14:35.758 --> 14:38.212
No, I am not on anything.

14:38.375 --> 14:43.463
I know that things have been difficult for you lately
and I was thinking you carried me for nine months.

14:43.635 --> 14:45.302
Let me carry you now.

14:45.467 --> 14:49.051
Well, right back at you, Colleen!

14:49.225 --> 14:50.012
Yeah, that's right!

14:50.186 --> 14:52.431
You cut Pop's balls off!

14:52.607 --> 14:56.601
And left him in the street to die!

14:56.777 --> 14:59.733
Liz, check out my wedding dress.

14:59.906 --> 15:01.732
Absolutely not, young lady.

15:01.906 --> 15:03.443
Kenneth, get Donaghy on the phone.

15:03.618 --> 15:05.481
Jonathan, I have
Tracy Jordan for Mr. Donaghy.

15:05.657 --> 15:08.611
No. No no no no.

15:10.705 --> 15:13.662
Tracy, please.
Do not bother Jack.

15:13.838 --> 15:15.790
He is in a weird place right now.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.120
Bebe Jackson's condo?

15:17.298 --> 15:17.703
No.

15:17.877 --> 15:19.332
A children's clothing store in Dubai?

15:19.508 --> 15:20.582
Stop guessing!

15:20.757 --> 15:23.251
What I'm saying is,
leave Jack alone.

15:23.425 --> 15:25.502
Too late, Liz Lemon.

15:25.677 --> 15:27.590
He called me five minutes ago.

15:27.767 --> 15:31.550
Five minutes ago
I was with him.

15:31.726 --> 15:32.681
How did he sound?

15:32.857 --> 15:33.851
What did he say?

15:34.018 --> 15:34.722
Nothing unusual.

15:34.896 --> 15:36.522
Russian mobs, invisible motorcycles...

15:36.685 --> 15:39.393
Sex pooping.

15:44.738 --> 15:45.521
Are you insane?

15:45.695 --> 15:49.993
What are you gonna do when Tracy asks Jack
for his invisible motorcycle?

15:50.156 --> 15:51.702
Uh... Yeah, dummy.

15:51.865 --> 15:55.532
Here's what you're gonna do.

15:58.166 --> 16:01.422
It's not your mother.

16:04.178 --> 16:04.631
Hello?

16:04.795 --> 16:05.881
Donaghy!

16:06.047 --> 16:06.803
What's up, Tray?

16:06.968 --> 16:07.632
If in the future...

16:07.806 --> 16:08.382
In the future...

16:08.556 --> 16:10.673
- If I mention anything crazy...
- If I mention anything crazy...

16:10.846 --> 16:12.470
- Like an invisible motorcycle...
- Like an invisible motorcycle...

16:12.635 --> 16:14.763
- It means I'm off my meds...
- It means I'm off my meds...

16:14.937 --> 16:17.853
- and should be ignored.
- should be ignored.

16:18.027 --> 16:21.603
Also, I think Josh Gerard
is a young Alex Guinness.

16:21.776 --> 16:23.522
Go back on your meds, Tracy.

16:23.695 --> 16:24.811
- Hang up.
- Hang up.

16:24.985 --> 16:25.942
- What?
- What?

16:26.116 --> 16:27.652
- Idiot.
- Idiot.

16:27.825 --> 16:29.440
Tracy, I've gotta go.

16:29.616 --> 16:31.992
Idiot.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.993
I think that went well.

16:35.168 --> 16:38.541
Now you gotta call Tracy as Jack.

16:38.706 --> 16:39.410
Or...

16:39.587 --> 16:42.712
I could call him...
as Christopher Walken.

16:42.877 --> 16:47.213
Do you not understand
what we're doing?

16:47.675 --> 16:51.423
Jenna, did you tell Life and Style
that your favorite book is the Koran?

16:51.595 --> 16:54.091
I just wanted to sound smart.

16:54.267 --> 16:55.723
Oh, hi, baby!

16:55.895 --> 16:59.011
Would you take her for a second?
I'm trying to finish her eyes.

16:59.188 --> 17:00.353
Oh, I'm actually really busy.

17:00.528 --> 17:02.772
I heard you were baby crazy.

17:02.948 --> 17:03.563
No.

17:03.736 --> 17:04.771
Yes, she is.

17:04.946 --> 17:05.849
Please.

17:06.027 --> 17:08.483
Oh, for the love of--nuts.

17:08.655 --> 17:09.611
Okay.

17:09.788 --> 17:11.942
Hi!

17:12.286 --> 17:13.362
How about that, huh?

17:13.535 --> 17:15.281
Yeah, she likes you.

17:15.454 --> 17:16.911
Go ahead, walk her around.

17:17.075 --> 17:19.622
Oh, okay.

17:20.377 --> 17:21.330
Look how pretty I look.

17:21.507 --> 17:23.962
Who's the cutest baby in the world?

17:24.127 --> 17:26.382
Who's the cutest baby in the world?

17:26.546 --> 17:30.633
Who's the cutest baby in the world?

17:32.516 --> 17:35.132
How did I get home?

17:35.308 --> 17:39.050
Why didn't you say something?

17:39.398 --> 17:41.810
Jack Donaghy.

17:41.976 --> 17:44.690
Now, I know you asked me
not to say anything.

17:44.855 --> 17:50.443
But I think I know somebody that can help you
with your sex poop problem.

17:50.617 --> 17:52.781
Hi.

17:54.576 --> 17:55.782
Please don't hurt me.

17:55.958 --> 17:56.611
I can't help it.

17:56.785 --> 17:58.412
It just pours out of me.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.830
I'm Jack Donaghy.
I'm important.

18:00.997 --> 18:02.332
I just bought the moon.

18:02.495 --> 18:06.371
Oh, my God.
I'm doing it again.

18:08.888 --> 18:10.251
What? 

18:10.428 --> 18:12.502
Mother, I love you too.

18:12.675 --> 18:16.470
But living together
is not gonna work out for me.

18:16.635 --> 18:18.971
Yes, I went this morning.

18:19.146 --> 18:23.182
I don't know, regular consistency?

18:23.568 --> 18:24.602
I can't do this.

18:24.777 --> 18:27.983
Every day for the rest of
your or her life.

18:28.157 --> 18:31.022
And she will outlive you.
She's like Castro.

18:31.197 --> 18:35.900
And  when you're done with that,
call my wife and tell her I'm sorry about
what happened with me and Keith and them.

18:36.077 --> 18:38.663
Wait, who?

18:42.286 --> 18:43.161
Oh, God!

18:43.336 --> 18:44.542
It's true that you had the baby.

18:44.706 --> 18:45.580
I don't know what happened.

18:45.807 --> 18:48.421
One minute I was holding the baby
in make-up and then suddenly...

18:48.588 --> 18:49.793
It was like highway hypnosis.

18:49.965 --> 18:52.502
You know, when you pull into your driveway
but you don't remember driving home?

18:52.676 --> 18:53.302
Oh, right right.

18:53.468 --> 18:54.880
And you have someone
else's baby in your car.

18:55.055 --> 18:56.883
I feel so terrible.

18:57.055 --> 18:57.553
Give me the baby.

18:57.727 --> 18:59.181
I'll try to smooth things over.

18:59.348 --> 18:59.970
What's her name?

19:00.148 --> 19:03.010
Well, Anna calls her Isobel,
but I call her Nancy.

19:03.187 --> 19:05.853
I think it might be a good idea
if I give Anna the rest of the week off.

19:06.028 --> 19:07.352
Seriously? We're really busy.

19:07.526 --> 19:09.982
No, of course. Of course.

19:10.155 --> 19:12.060
Stealing a baby? Really?

19:12.237 --> 19:14.151
Hey, I found Isobel!

19:14.326 --> 19:15.480
I'm a hero.

19:15.658 --> 19:17.320
Hi, baby.

19:17.498 --> 19:18.990
Hi, muffin.

19:19.157 --> 19:22.823
Oh, I'm so glad you're back.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.211
You're loving this, aren't you?

19:28.378 --> 19:29.582
Oh, yes.

19:29.758 --> 19:33.962
I'm a big fan of kidnapping.
Especially by my middle management.

19:34.137 --> 19:37.710
So the thing you were saying about listening to your mind
and not your body, how's that going for you?

19:37.885 --> 19:39.720
My body's telling me several things.

19:39.887 --> 19:41.841
First of all, I need to start working out.

19:42.018 --> 19:43.432
That kid was killing my arms.

19:43.608 --> 19:48.312
Number two, I could be very happy
with a baby that looks nothing like me
and didn't bake in my oven.

19:48.486 --> 19:51.482
Three, I gotta let myself
have a personal life.

19:51.656 --> 19:53.191
What I've been telling you for five months.

19:53.368 --> 19:54.481
Well, you're right again.

19:54.656 --> 19:57.320
Right it down in your
little "I'm Awesome" book.

19:57.485 --> 19:59.283
Where are you going?
You have a rehearsal about to start.

19:59.445 --> 20:02.912
I stole a baby, Jack.
I'm taking a half day.

20:03.075 --> 20:04.203
Fair enough.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.663
I have to do some thinking.

20:05.838 --> 20:08.002
Maybe it's impossible to have it all.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.290
Career, the family...

20:10.468 --> 20:13.922
But if anybody can figure out
how to do it, it's me.

20:14.088 --> 20:15.173
That's going up.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.922
Oh, nerds!

20:24.015 --> 20:26.353
I was talking about you at work today, Mother.

20:26.516 --> 20:30.233
I think my boss, Mr. Jack Donaghy,
wishes you were his mother.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.523
Isn't that something, mother?

20:32.697 --> 20:35.063
Yes, Kenneth, that's sweet.

20:35.238 --> 20:37.111
Do you have me on speaker phone again?

20:37.276 --> 20:37.942
Yes, Ma'am!

20:38.117 --> 20:39.610
It's just like Charlie's Angels!

20:39.787 --> 20:43.531
Oh, by the way, did you get your old
Halloween decorations I sent you?

20:43.707 --> 20:45.202
Oh, yes, thank you!

20:45.375 --> 20:47.413
I'm looking at the kooky skeleton right now.

20:47.585 --> 20:48.873
I love it!

20:49.046 --> 20:50.792
You're the best mother in the whole world!

20:50.956 --> 20:53.043
Okay, calm down, dear.

20:53.218 --> 20:55.923
Yes, Mother.
