WEBVTT

00:02.015 --> 00:05.367
All right, gentlemen, and I use
that word quite sarcastically,

00:05.467 --> 00:07.951
it's time to lighten your
wallets with a game called poker.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.350
Poker!

00:09.927 --> 00:12.958
Okay, let that be the only new
word she learns tonight, got it?

00:13.058 --> 00:14.074
Got it.

00:14.109 --> 00:15.824
So, should we start with
a little five-card stud?

00:15.924 --> 00:17.707
Stud!

00:17.759 --> 00:18.808
(laughs) Sorry.

00:20.796 --> 00:22.846
All right, the buy-in is 20 bucks.

00:22.881 --> 00:25.832
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa. Condoms instead of chips?

00:25.884 --> 00:29.536
Look, we are not giving
you 20 bucks for condoms.

00:29.571 --> 00:32.522
We can steal these for
free from your room.

00:32.524 --> 00:33.657
Well, I'm tired of
supporting your habit.

00:33.692 --> 00:37.477
From now on, if you wanna
get laid, I've gotta get paid.

00:37.512 --> 00:39.562
Hey, I don't think anyone
should use this one.

00:39.598 --> 00:40.597
There's a bunch of tiny holes in it.

00:40.632 --> 00:42.482
Wait, same with these.

00:42.517 --> 00:45.819
And this one. Oh, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.804
They all have holes in them!

00:47.839 --> 00:48.939
We've been using these condoms.

00:48.974 --> 00:49.940
Do you know what this means?

00:49.975 --> 00:51.908
Uh-oh!

00:53.745 --> 00:55.712
You heard the girl, start panicking!

I checked them all, they

01:10.837 --> 01:14.923
So all three of our
girlfriends might be pregnant?

01:14.975 --> 01:17.842
See, man, this is what happens
when you buy condoms in bulk.

01:18.845 --> 01:20.979
You have babies in bulk!

01:21.014 --> 01:23.815
Oh, I can't breathe!

01:23.850 --> 01:25.734
Well, isn't this just perfect?

01:25.769 --> 01:26.985
Sam and I are finally
together, and now our next date

01:27.020 --> 01:30.739
is gonna be dinner,
movie, and an ultrasound.

01:30.774 --> 01:31.856
But what about me, man?

01:31.908 --> 01:33.775
"Oh, hey, Renee, I wasn't sure

01:33.827 --> 01:35.827
"what to get you for our
one-month anniversary,

01:35.862 --> 01:38.747
so I got you a baby!"

01:38.782 --> 01:39.948
What are we gonna do?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.783
I guess we'll just have to tell them.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.034
No, about my breathing!

01:43.086 --> 01:45.787
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why
would we tell them something

01:45.839 --> 01:47.789
when there might be nothing to tell?

01:47.841 --> 01:49.841
Right? I mean, it's only a problem

01:49.876 --> 01:51.876
if someone is actually pregnant.

01:51.878 --> 01:53.762
He's right.

01:53.797 --> 01:55.764
There might be nothing to worry about.

01:55.799 --> 01:56.798
We just gotta find a way

01:56.850 --> 01:57.799
for them to take a pregnancy test

01:57.851 --> 01:58.883
without them knowing.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.718
I'd help you think of stuff,

02:00.771 --> 02:03.855
but there's no blood
in my brain right now.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.890
Which is exactly how
I got in this situation

02:05.892 --> 02:08.810
in the first place.

02:11.898 --> 02:12.897
Is there a non-creepy,

02:12.949 --> 02:14.732
non-suspicious way to ask a girl

02:14.734 --> 02:15.867
to pee on a stick for you?

02:15.902 --> 02:17.869
No... no, but look.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.738
There is a test you can
take using just saliva.

02:20.791 --> 02:22.740
Oh, oh, saliva? I'm in!

02:22.742 --> 02:23.875
Do mine first.

02:25.962 --> 02:28.746
Yeah, he especially should
not be having a baby.

02:28.799 --> 02:29.831
Yeah, no.

02:31.802 --> 02:33.802
No, Danny, I can't leave
work in the middle of the day

02:33.837 --> 02:35.787
to help you lick envelopes.

02:36.840 --> 02:40.658
All right. I'll see you tonight.

02:40.710 --> 02:41.659
Love you.

02:41.711 --> 02:42.760
Aw. I know you do.

02:42.762 --> 02:44.729
Wish I could say it back.

02:44.781 --> 02:46.631
So, why am I here?

02:46.666 --> 02:48.983
Okay, so the partners
finally gave me an assistant...

02:49.019 --> 02:51.569
Here you are, Ms. Perrin,

02:51.605 --> 02:53.605
the affidavits for the
Murphy case you requested,

02:53.640 --> 02:54.956
coffee, black, two
sugars, and a reminder

02:54.991 --> 02:56.608
that your meeting
starts in five minutes.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.893
Uh, actually, I asked
for the Torkelson file,

02:58.929 --> 03:02.764
I drink tea, and my meeting
started two hours ago.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.884
Right. Uh, the Harrison file, soy latte,

03:05.886 --> 03:08.653
and gather everyone in the
conference room for your meeting.

03:11.808 --> 03:13.775
Wow.

03:13.810 --> 03:16.644
Does that kind of incompetence
come with a helmet?

03:16.680 --> 03:18.563
He has got to go.

03:18.598 --> 03:21.599
I know. I know. All right, that's
why I wanted to talk to you.

03:21.651 --> 03:25.887
I just don't have your kind of
cruel, heartless, go-for-the-throat...

03:25.939 --> 03:28.873
Stop it, you're making me blush.

03:28.875 --> 03:33.828
Okay, it's simple. You just
have to be direct, okay?

03:33.864 --> 03:35.780
Roger, can I see you, please?

03:35.815 --> 03:36.881
Oh, no, no, what are you doing?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.734
- I can't.
- Yes. You can.

03:39.769 --> 03:42.770
Just pretend he's a
cupcake, and eat him alive!

03:43.940 --> 03:48.743
Roger, Ms. Perrin has some
unfortunate news for you.

03:48.778 --> 03:50.628
What is it, Ms. Perrin?

03:50.630 --> 03:54.582
Uh, Roger, um, I just...
I was just thinking that...

03:54.618 --> 03:57.619
(muttering, whimpering)

04:03.910 --> 04:05.176
Hey! You got a minute?

04:05.212 --> 04:06.911
I'm just trying out some new
appetizers. What do you think?

04:09.749 --> 04:12.767
Oh, my God, it's disgusting.

04:12.819 --> 04:13.868
Yeah, I thought it was gross, too.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.720
Here, go ahead, spit it out.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.589
All of it. Even the saliva.

04:22.646 --> 04:25.997

04:38.912 --> 04:41.796
Huh? Danny... Danny, wake up.

04:41.848 --> 04:42.931
What's wrong, babe?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.750
I was just choking on
this, this was in my mouth.

04:45.752 --> 04:48.636
Well, you were snoring pretty hard,

04:48.672 --> 04:50.555
maybe you sucked it
in from the bathroom.

04:59.599 --> 05:00.949
(knocking)

05:00.984 --> 05:02.967
Roger? What are you doing here?

05:03.003 --> 05:04.869
Ms. Perrin has a client
meeting this morning,

05:04.904 --> 05:06.938
and I gave her the wrong case
files yesterday before she left.

05:06.990 --> 05:08.840
- Where's the meeting?
- At our office.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.875
- Where are you coming from?
- The office.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.744
See where I'm going with this?

05:12.796 --> 05:15.730
Oh, my God! I'm the
worst assistant ever.

05:15.782 --> 05:18.716
Roger, why don't you come inside,
and we'll have a little chatty-chat

05:18.718 --> 05:19.751
about your work sitch?

05:19.786 --> 05:21.786
Uh-oh.

05:23.790 --> 05:27.542
Uh-oh? Why did the
little girl say "Uh-oh"?

05:27.577 --> 05:28.660
Oh, I knew it, I'm getting fired.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.595
I don't know what's wrong with me.

05:30.647 --> 05:33.665
Ever since I met the girl of my dreams,
I just haven't been able to focus.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.567
So, that's why you've been so bad?

05:36.603 --> 05:37.919
You're in love?

05:37.954 --> 05:40.855
Oh... Roger.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.680
I've always struggled with confidence.

05:48.732 --> 05:50.832
I try, but it's hard when no
one's ever believed in you.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.834
But I'm sure someone
like you has no idea

05:52.886 --> 05:54.769
what I'm talking about.

05:54.821 --> 05:59.574
Sure, I'm confident now. I
mean, I could knock you down

05:59.609 --> 06:01.576
and take you right here on
this couch if I wanted to.

06:05.565 --> 06:08.850
But you know, Roger, it wasn't
long ago that I woke up one day

06:08.885 --> 06:11.903
with no husband, no
job, and worst of all,

06:11.938 --> 06:14.772
no one around to believe in me.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.841
I don't wish that feeling on anyone.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.760
You know what, Roger?

06:18.812 --> 06:21.696
I am gonna help you
find your confidence.

06:21.748 --> 06:22.864
Just let me put my
granddaughter down for a nap.

06:25.819 --> 06:29.771
See, Emma? Sometimes we
have to do the right thing,

06:29.806 --> 06:31.706
and open our hearts to losers.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.593
There we go. Okay.

06:36.613 --> 06:37.995
(gasps) My earring.

06:37.997 --> 06:40.515
I've been looking all over for this.

06:40.550 --> 06:41.983
Oh, you could've gotten hurt.

06:43.970 --> 06:45.970
Okay, come here, sweets.

06:45.972 --> 06:48.940
Oh... and a condom. Nice.

06:48.975 --> 06:49.891
God.

06:51.828 --> 06:55.730
Emma... did you poke holes in
this with Grandma's earring?

06:57.701 --> 07:00.818
No, Emma. Never do that.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.754
Unless he's a billionaire
or a movie star.

07:11.531 --> 07:15.533
Holey condoms, Emma! You turned
these things into sprinklers!

07:17.554 --> 07:19.904
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

07:19.939 --> 07:21.773
Okay, I'm ready for my first lesson.

07:21.825 --> 07:22.890
Oh, first lesson.

07:22.926 --> 07:24.942
Right, um... Oh, it's babysitting!

07:24.978 --> 07:25.893
(shrieks)

07:28.848 --> 07:29.881
(elevator dings)

07:29.883 --> 07:30.898
Oh, hey, Mom.

07:30.934 --> 07:34.669
Big problem. Have you...
Did you... Don't panic!

07:34.721 --> 07:35.903
I'm gonna take care of it.

07:35.939 --> 07:37.772
(muttering) Oh, yeah. They're
sprinklers, they got holes...

07:41.694 --> 07:43.728
Must've run out of wine again.

07:43.763 --> 07:46.664
I can't believe we all
struck out on the saliva test.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.949
What are we gonna do now?

07:47.984 --> 07:49.600
I vote for nothing.

07:49.602 --> 07:51.536
Look, if they're pregnant,
they'll tell us eventually,

07:51.538 --> 07:52.920
and we'll just pretend we
don't know how it happened.

07:52.956 --> 07:55.740
I like it. I'm really good
at not knowing anything.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.728
For example, I don't
know who this guy is.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.799
You're probably all wondering
why I asked you here.

08:04.834 --> 08:08.736
Not me. How much do you need, 40, 50?

08:08.788 --> 08:10.705
Thanks.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.641
But that's not why I'm here.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.478
Have any of you used one of
these condoms from Ben's room?

08:17.530 --> 08:18.563
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

08:18.615 --> 08:19.964
I think so.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.867
Well, that is a problem then.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.535
Why, is something
wrong with the condoms?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.954
No, I'm taking a survey. Yes,
something's wrong with the condoms.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.823
You all might be pregnant.

08:28.858 --> 08:32.860
(all talking at once)

08:40.236 --> 08:42.068
(timer dings)

08:42.121 --> 08:43.169
- Oh, thank God!
- Perfect!

08:43.222 --> 08:45.055
- Negative!
- Not pregnant!

08:45.090 --> 08:46.406
Dodged that Tucker bullet!

08:46.458 --> 08:49.059
I'm on the pill, but you never know.

08:49.061 --> 08:52.346
Well, I say we celebrate with a drink
we almost couldn't have for nine months.

08:52.381 --> 08:55.282
And I know right where
Ben keeps the good stuff.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.383
Ah!

08:56.418 --> 09:00.320
Which is right next to
a saliva pregnancy test.

09:03.359 --> 09:06.093
Oh, my God, they knew.

09:06.128 --> 09:09.112
All right. I woke up last night
with a cotton swab in my mouth.

09:09.114 --> 09:11.031
Unbelievable!

09:11.066 --> 09:14.051
You think you know everything
about a person after four dates,

09:14.086 --> 09:15.936
and then he pulls something like this.

09:17.122 --> 09:19.122
Well, then maybe they
should know what it's like,

09:19.158 --> 09:21.391
if we were pregnant.

09:24.930 --> 09:27.281
Sorry, Danny, I just don't
feel like lunch today.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.383
Yeah, I've been nauseous all morning.

09:29.418 --> 09:31.234
(retches) Oh, no!

09:31.236 --> 09:33.303
Here it comes again! I gotta go, bye!

09:34.323 --> 09:37.140
Now it's your turn to feel nauseous.

09:37.176 --> 09:40.143
Hey, hey. So, what's the verdict?

09:40.195 --> 09:44.181
Not to dramatize, but
are you fertilized?

09:44.233 --> 09:47.050
Nope, negative.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.103
Yeah, which is right in line with
how I feel about men right now.

09:50.155 --> 09:53.040
So you know what I'm gonna
do? I am going to fire one.

09:54.093 --> 09:56.376
Roger, get your sweet
little ass in here.

09:56.412 --> 09:59.413
Whoa whoa. You know, Riley,

09:59.448 --> 10:01.965
sometimes people just need
someone to believe in them.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.401
They just need a word
of encouragement or two.

10:04.436 --> 10:07.254
I cannot believe you're drunk
in the middle of the day.

10:09.224 --> 10:10.374
All right. I am firing him.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.093
No... No, you can't.

10:13.128 --> 10:14.311
He's the boss's son.

10:14.346 --> 10:16.129
- What?
- Yeah.

10:16.181 --> 10:17.130
My God, really?

10:17.182 --> 10:19.983
How did I not know this?

10:20.035 --> 10:22.219
Thank you so much. You
just saved my career.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.138
Hey! Hey you!

10:25.174 --> 10:28.392
Is everything okay? Am I getting fired?

10:28.427 --> 10:30.394
Fired? You?

10:30.429 --> 10:32.429
No! That's... That's hilarious.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.031
(laughing)

10:34.066 --> 10:36.299
So funny!

10:36.335 --> 10:38.251
No, you and me, we're a team.

10:38.287 --> 10:39.603
All right? We're partners.

10:39.605 --> 10:43.323
Speaking of partners, I would
really like to be one one day.

10:43.359 --> 10:46.209
But I'm gonna go to my staff meeting,

10:46.261 --> 10:48.145
which is in room...?

10:50.299 --> 10:52.115
You know what, I'll find it.

10:53.318 --> 10:57.087
Oh, and by the way, I love
that sweater. So handsome.

10:58.140 --> 11:00.991
Oh, my God! I get to keep my job!

11:00.993 --> 11:03.377
And... I think she might love me, too.

11:03.412 --> 11:07.330
Yeah, yeah. I wouldn't
doubt it. Wait, what?

11:07.332 --> 11:09.983
Riley is the girl you're in love with?

11:10.035 --> 11:11.368
Yes, I thought that was clear.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.387
Did you tell me it was
a girl at the office?

11:13.422 --> 11:15.322
- No.
- Did you tell me it was Riley?

11:15.374 --> 11:17.174
- No.
- See where I'm going with this?

11:21.346 --> 11:23.280
Aren't you hungry?

11:23.282 --> 11:26.099
Or are you one of those
girls who eats before a date

11:26.135 --> 11:28.068
so you can look like you hardly eat?

11:28.120 --> 11:30.153
(laughs) I do that!

11:32.057 --> 11:35.425
I'm just feeling a little... nauseous.

11:35.461 --> 11:37.394
Nauseous?

11:37.429 --> 11:39.446
You feel nauseous?

11:39.498 --> 11:42.349
Yeah. It usually only
happens in the morning.

11:42.384 --> 11:44.234
I hope I'm not catching a bug.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.304
It might be a bit bigger than a bug.

11:49.241 --> 11:52.142
Hey. What do you feel like
doing after work today?

11:52.144 --> 11:54.194
I think I'm just gonna
go home and lie down.

11:54.229 --> 11:56.179
I don't know what's wrong
with me, but my back hurts,

11:56.215 --> 11:59.116
my ankles are swollen, and
even my boobs are a little sore.

11:59.151 --> 12:02.169
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say I was pregnant.

12:02.221 --> 12:04.971
Pregnant?

12:05.007 --> 12:06.123
Ha!

12:06.125 --> 12:08.992
'Cause that calls for a "Ha!"

12:09.027 --> 12:10.026
Ha...

12:15.017 --> 12:16.283
Oh my, God.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.269
I'm glad you're feeling better.

12:19.271 --> 12:20.370
I'm starving.

12:20.405 --> 12:22.289
But you know what I would really love?

12:22.341 --> 12:25.325
A peanut butter and pickle sandwich.

12:25.377 --> 12:28.261
Weird, huh?

12:28.313 --> 12:31.131
So you'd say you're having a craving?

12:31.166 --> 12:33.099
Yeah! Yeah, I would.

12:41.043 --> 12:41.975
Riley's pregnant.

12:42.010 --> 12:44.060
- So is Renee.
- I think Sam's pregnant, too.

12:44.112 --> 12:46.963
Okay. Are we about to
high-five or freak out?

12:47.015 --> 12:48.298
Because I'm leaning
towards freaking out.

12:48.350 --> 12:50.367
- Freak out.
- Okay.

12:54.019 --> 12:54.851
Okay, let's review

12:55.996 --> 12:57.128
Danny, you're going to have a child

12:57.164 --> 12:59.014
with the girl of your dreams.

12:59.049 --> 13:01.933
Ben, you're having your
second unplanned child

13:01.969 --> 13:04.936
with a cheerleader you've been
in love with since high school.

13:04.988 --> 13:06.988
And I've knocked up a girl
whose name I'm not even sure

13:06.990 --> 13:09.808
is spelled with two "E's" or three.

13:09.843 --> 13:11.860
Well, then, we're just gonna
have to tell them the truth.

13:11.862 --> 13:14.779
No. No, no one is
telling anyone anything.

13:14.815 --> 13:16.865
Riley and I just got back
together, and if she finds out

13:16.900 --> 13:18.733
I was lying to her and
didn't say anything,

13:18.769 --> 13:20.135
then there will be
no more back together.

13:20.187 --> 13:22.070
Wait. We wouldn't even be in this mess

13:22.072 --> 13:23.755
if the girls found out about the condoms

13:23.807 --> 13:25.273
at the same time we did.

13:25.275 --> 13:30.979
I get it. We just keep using the condoms
until they notice the holes in them.

13:31.014 --> 13:33.965
No.

13:34.017 --> 13:36.868
We just redo the poker game,
and this time we invite them.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.972
And we discover the bad condoms
all together. It's genius.

13:41.024 --> 13:43.842
As long as we're doing that,
can we also redo the poker game

13:43.877 --> 13:44.893
from three weeks ago?

13:44.928 --> 13:46.811
'Cause I lost a ton of money that night.

13:49.766 --> 13:51.182
Roger! No!

13:53.804 --> 13:57.072
I told you, Riley has a boyfriend.

13:57.074 --> 14:00.008
A big giant boyfriend.

14:00.010 --> 14:02.027
But I feel like she's seen the light.

14:02.062 --> 14:05.013
Yeah, well, that light's gonna get
real dark once he punches you out.

14:05.048 --> 14:07.999
Riley is worth a thousand
punches to the head.

14:08.035 --> 14:11.820
Which clearly, you've already taken.

14:11.872 --> 14:14.939
Listen, Roger. Danny and
Riley just got back together.

14:14.975 --> 14:17.892
But currently, their relationship
is hanging on by a thread.

14:17.944 --> 14:20.945
And I'm not gonna let you
snap it by barging in there

14:20.981 --> 14:22.897
and professing your love for her.

14:22.933 --> 14:26.668
So Riley's in there?
And I have a chance?

14:26.720 --> 14:27.852
Riley, I'm coming for you!

14:27.904 --> 14:30.071
Oh, no, you're not! No, you're not!

14:30.123 --> 14:32.791
No, you're not! I can do
this all day, pretty boy!

14:32.843 --> 14:34.743
You are going down!

14:34.778 --> 14:38.046
Bring it on, Roger. Bring it on!

14:38.081 --> 14:40.982
- The roof!
- Ohh, damn it!

14:41.018 --> 14:44.085
Roger! No! No, no, no!

14:45.105 --> 14:46.988
Well, this is a first.

14:47.024 --> 14:49.057
You guys inviting us to poker night.

14:49.092 --> 14:50.825
Where are the chips?

14:50.861 --> 14:52.927
Oh. It's normally a $20 buy-in, but...

14:52.963 --> 14:55.980
we can make this a friendly game, right?

14:56.016 --> 14:57.749
Condoms.

14:57.801 --> 14:59.834
Wow, that's... pretty friendly.

15:01.705 --> 15:03.671
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

15:03.673 --> 15:05.790
(both grunting)

15:05.826 --> 15:07.742
Damn, you're bony!

15:07.778 --> 15:08.743
Ow!

15:08.779 --> 15:11.713
Five-card draw,
one-eyed Jacks are wild.

15:14.718 --> 15:16.985
Riley, do you have enough chips?

15:16.987 --> 15:19.120
Or do you want a couple of mine?

15:19.156 --> 15:23.024
I'm good. Thanks. Uh, I'll take two.

15:26.897 --> 15:28.997
What? This is weird.

15:28.999 --> 15:32.767
Wow, this condom has
a bunch of holes in it.

15:32.803 --> 15:34.886
Wow, and... Oh, my God,
you guys, here we are

15:34.921 --> 15:39.758
all just discovering it
for the very first time.

15:39.810 --> 15:42.744
Well, lucky you found
it now, am I right?

15:42.779 --> 15:45.013
I'll take one.

15:45.065 --> 15:47.082
(stammers) Hey! Wait.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.117
This condom has a couple
of holes in it, too.

15:49.119 --> 15:50.985
I wonder if they all do?

15:51.021 --> 15:52.921
Oh, my God, Danny, you're right.

15:52.956 --> 15:54.122
They must all be defective.

15:54.124 --> 15:56.941
Then let's make sure we don't use those.

15:56.977 --> 15:57.909
Three, please.

15:57.961 --> 15:59.778
What if we've already used them?

15:59.813 --> 16:01.780
Surely someone must be thinking that?

16:02.916 --> 16:03.865
Anyone?

16:08.805 --> 16:11.106
Aah! Pull me back up!

16:11.158 --> 16:13.708
Only if you leave Riley alone!

16:13.710 --> 16:15.059
Never!

16:15.112 --> 16:18.046
Are you sure, Roge? You're
gettin' pretty heavy.

16:18.098 --> 16:21.116
Ben, so what if we
all used your condoms?

16:21.118 --> 16:23.968
I think we'd know if we
were pregnant, right, ladies?

16:24.020 --> 16:25.954
- Of course.
- Yeah, totally.

16:25.956 --> 16:28.973
Ah! Full house! Read 'em and weep!

16:29.009 --> 16:31.876
The cards don't lie.

16:31.928 --> 16:33.928
The cards don't, but we do!

16:33.964 --> 16:37.715
Riley, you're pregnant.
You're all pregnant!

16:37.751 --> 16:38.883
I really wanted to tell
you about the condoms,

16:38.919 --> 16:40.685
but they didn't let me.

16:40.737 --> 16:42.170
I'm so sorry, please, please,
don't break up with me again.

16:42.205 --> 16:44.139
Our child needs a father!

16:45.775 --> 16:48.810
I liked it better when
you didn't know anything.

16:50.130 --> 16:52.163
I'm not pregnant.

16:52.199 --> 16:54.015
Okay? None of us are.

16:54.050 --> 16:56.034
That's not true, you
have all the symptoms.

16:56.069 --> 16:58.937
No, the only symptoms we have
are dating a bunch of idiots.

16:58.972 --> 17:01.055
Your mom told us about
the holes in the condoms.

17:01.057 --> 17:02.991
Thank God for her, she saved our lives.

17:02.993 --> 17:05.042
(grunting, panting)

17:06.896 --> 17:09.814
Oh, my God! You saved my life.

17:09.849 --> 17:14.752
Yeah, that's right. So now
you'll leave Riley alone?

17:14.788 --> 17:15.869
Riley!

17:15.922 --> 17:17.922
Dammit!

17:20.777 --> 17:22.676
I'm sorry.

17:22.729 --> 17:23.845
I didn't know what to do.

17:23.896 --> 17:27.749
Well, here's a crazy idea:
maybe tell the truth next time.

17:33.039 --> 17:34.973
Eh, she'll be fine.
I'll call her tomorrow.

17:37.043 --> 17:39.961
Wow, Tucker, too bad your
girlfriend isn't very understanding.

17:39.963 --> 17:41.896
Thank God mine is.

17:41.898 --> 17:43.831
Right?

17:43.884 --> 17:45.900
You almost gave me a heart attack.

17:45.936 --> 17:47.869
The last thing I want to
do right now is have a kid.

17:47.871 --> 17:50.855
Trust me, neither do I.
Eventually, sure, but right now,

17:50.891 --> 17:52.740
no, thank you. Am I right?

17:52.742 --> 17:55.843
So right. Not now,
and actually, not ever.

17:57.781 --> 17:59.814
Riley, I think you're right.

17:59.849 --> 18:01.716
We should just forget
this ever happened.

18:01.718 --> 18:03.785
I never said that.

18:03.820 --> 18:05.753
Could you?

18:05.805 --> 18:09.073
Danny, you should've
followed your instincts,

18:09.109 --> 18:11.676
and not let anyone... Ben or Tucker...

18:11.711 --> 18:13.678
talk you out of telling me.

18:13.713 --> 18:15.980
We have to believe that our
relationship is strong enough

18:16.016 --> 18:18.016
that we don't have to hide
anything from each other,

18:18.051 --> 18:22.003
that there's absolutely nothing
that I wouldn't tell you about.

18:22.005 --> 18:24.923
Riley, I love you!
And I know you love me!

18:28.962 --> 18:30.895
Is there something you wanna tell me?

18:30.931 --> 18:32.714
No, I'm good.

18:35.702 --> 18:37.819
So, let's never do that again.

18:37.871 --> 18:40.772
By "again" you mean the use
of defective condoms, right?

18:40.807 --> 18:42.657
Because if we're never
doing the other thing again,

18:42.709 --> 18:44.726
I foresee some issues
with our relationship.

18:44.761 --> 18:47.729
Yes, I meant the condoms.

18:47.764 --> 18:50.982
But let's maybe triple down from now on.

18:51.017 --> 18:53.067
The whole kid thing is
a little too much for me.

18:53.119 --> 18:57.972
Yeah... about that. Did you really
mean you never wanna have kids?

18:58.024 --> 19:01.793
I did, it's just... not
something I see in my future.

19:01.845 --> 19:05.830
But... I have a kid, and
she's definitely in my future.

19:05.882 --> 19:07.949
Oh, and I will totally get used to that.

19:07.984 --> 19:09.767
I can deal with Emma.

19:09.803 --> 19:13.805
Yeah... see... "deal with" and "used to"

19:13.857 --> 19:16.858
are not exactly the words a father
wants to hear about his little girl.

19:16.860 --> 19:20.094
Plus... I want more kids.

19:20.146 --> 19:23.698
Having a brother growing up was
part of what made me who I am.

19:24.751 --> 19:28.653
I'm sorry, Ben, it's just not who I am.

19:32.075 --> 19:34.676
I can't believe I'm
about to say this, but...

19:34.678 --> 19:37.111
if that's how you truly feel,

19:37.147 --> 19:40.665
then I don't think
we have a future, Sam.

19:40.700 --> 19:42.133
You're kidding, right?

19:42.168 --> 19:45.069
After all we went through to get here?

19:45.105 --> 19:51.092
But here without a family
is nowhere for me. I'm sorry.

19:51.094 --> 19:53.978
I'm sorry, too.

19:56.066 --> 19:58.099
Hey! Has anyone seen Roger?

19:58.101 --> 20:02.987
Nope? You know... you
two make a nice couple.

20:07.848 --> 20:11.616
Well, it is a relief to know that I'm
not gonna be a grandma again right away.

20:12.753 --> 20:16.752
But you know, those tests are not
always accurate this early in pregnancy.

20:16.777 --> 20:19.810
Okay. Well, I guess I know what
I'm doing in my lunch hour.

20:21.432 --> 20:25.979
Here is your tea, your folder on Jonson
case and I had your parking validated.

20:26.812 --> 20:30.890
***

20:30.990 --> 20:33.893
***

20:36.501 --> 20:38.923
- So, you still haven't fired him yet?
- I can't.

20:38.948 --> 20:40.589
Remember, boss' son?

20:40.689 --> 20:44.482
Yeah, yeah, about that, hum...

20:45.409 --> 20:47.409
You know what? Never mind.
