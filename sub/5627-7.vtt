00:06.960 --> 00:08.580
Previously onCriminal Minds...

00:08.580 --> 00:12.170
This guy stumbles into
the Atlantic City ER,

00:12.170 --> 00:13.710
having been shot in the jaw.

00:14.670 --> 00:16.420
They were able to give a name,
Giuseppe Montolo.

00:16.920 --> 00:17.960
He's a contract killer.

00:18.210 --> 00:19.830
Only a hit man would be this good.

00:25.080 --> 00:26.500
You're under arrest.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.580
He's playing us.
The only leverage he has

00:28.580 --> 00:31.580
is a list of potential victims
targeted by a network of hitmen.

00:31.580 --> 00:32.880
I know there's more of you out there,

00:32.880 --> 00:34.960
but me and my team will not rest

00:34.960 --> 00:37.580
until we take every last
one of you sons of bitches down.

00:40.330 --> 00:41.750
"The Dirty Dozen."

00:42.080 --> 00:43.670
This is who you're gonna kill next.

01:10.040 --> 01:12.120
Your lawyer told me you're ready to talk.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.540
Can you talk?

01:18.710 --> 01:20.080
I can talk.

01:22.040 --> 01:26.540
Any deal we make is contingent
on actionable intelligence.

01:26.540 --> 01:29.920
That means we make an arrest
before we make you comfortable.

01:29.920 --> 01:32.460
-Capisce?-

01:32.460 --> 01:35.960
You're part of an interconnected group
of hitmen working together online.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.000
Yes or no?

01:38.080 --> 01:39.170
Si.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.540
-How many of them are you?
-

01:42.750 --> 01:45.120
Besides me, quattro.

01:48.250 --> 01:51.420
I need names and contact information.

01:54.580 --> 01:56.210
And the last time we talked,

01:56.210 --> 01:58.750
you hinted that this was your next target.

01:58.750 --> 02:00.830
"The Dirty Dozen." Who are they?

02:04.540 --> 02:07.170
That's the wrong question.

02:07.170 --> 02:10.120
It's not a who...

02:10.120 --> 02:11.460
It's a what.

02:12.540 --> 02:14.670
-What does that mean exactly?
-

02:14.670 --> 02:17.120
Look, cut the act!
I ain't in the mood to play with you.

02:17.120 --> 02:18.880
What does it mean?

02:25.960 --> 02:29.120
Don't choke! Hey! I need medical!

02:29.580 --> 02:30.790
-Don't choke!
-

02:31.670 --> 02:33.000
Get me medical!

02:43.210 --> 02:45.080
Hi!

02:45.670 --> 02:47.670
-Oh!
-Welcome back! Welcome back.

02:47.670 --> 02:51.420
-I missed you guys.
-Oh, we missed you more.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.170
Hey.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.000
Oh, wow. Oh, my gosh, nice.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.790
Will's favorite brand. Thank you, Rossi.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.380
-And, Spence, wow.
-It's my original set.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.250
And I realize that
most of this information

03:07.250 --> 03:09.080
is most likely on that "Internet."

03:09.080 --> 03:11.460
But you can never teach
old-fashioned research habits too soon.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.040
How's the little guy doing?
-Oh, he's good.

03:14.330 --> 03:16.710
He's sleeping through the night for now,
at least.

03:16.710 --> 03:19.210
Oh, and, Spence, I showed him the
picture of when you first visited

03:19.210 --> 03:22.040
and he started kicking his little legs
and he smiled real big.

03:22.040 --> 03:24.290
Who wouldn't get excited
seeing that bella faccia?

03:24.290 --> 03:25.540
I think he wants to see you.

03:25.540 --> 03:26.670
You know, studies have shown

03:26.670 --> 03:28.000
that babies begin exhibiting cognizable

03:28.000 --> 03:29.670
non-verbal communication
within days of birth.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.250
And some things never change.

03:31.250 --> 03:35.290
Yeah. And some things do,
and because of that,

03:35.290 --> 03:39.080
we took the liberty of doing this...

03:39.880 --> 03:42.080
It's all the pictures
you sent while you were away.

03:43.790 --> 03:47.960
You guys, I love it. It's perfect.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.750
Thank you, all of you.

03:50.790 --> 03:51.920
Almost all of you.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.380
They're debriefing.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.330
The warden determined that Montolo

03:58.330 --> 04:00.330
had been poisoned
by one of the guards.

04:00.330 --> 04:01.620
Did they make an arrest?

04:01.620 --> 04:03.750
No. The guard was found shot,
execution-style, in his car.

04:06.540 --> 04:09.330
Hotch, Montolo
was our only viable lead.

04:09.710 --> 04:11.460
When I asked him
who the Dirty Dozen were,

04:11.460 --> 04:13.500
he said it's not who, it's what.

04:14.120 --> 04:17.330
So maybe it's not
a list of human targets like we thought.

04:17.330 --> 04:19.330
It could just be something
in the hitmen's infrastructure.

04:19.330 --> 04:21.040
Well, it doesn't change our investigation.

04:21.040 --> 04:23.500
I'll have Garcia search the darknet
with new parameters.

04:23.500 --> 04:24.620
Yeah.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.250
Well, for the next five minutes, anyway,

04:29.250 --> 04:31.210
I just want to enjoy the fact
that our friend is back.

04:32.380 --> 04:36.330
Okay, and this is your
Bureau-approved bubbly.

04:36.330 --> 04:39.580
Cheers.
Okay, now tell me all about Tara Lewis.

04:39.580 --> 04:40.920
She is really excited to meet you.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.830
I think her exact words
after reading your reports were,

04:42.830 --> 04:45.210
"Is JJ as awesome as I think she is?"

04:45.460 --> 04:46.830
I like her already.

04:48.120 --> 04:50.920
Okay, you did not just have a baby.

04:50.920 --> 04:52.710
Hi.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.380
Oh...

04:54.380 --> 04:55.880
-Welcome back.
-Hi.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.670
Seriously, talk to me. What is
your secret? 'Cause you look good.

04:58.670 --> 05:00.170
Well, yeah, see these guns?

05:00.170 --> 05:02.080
It's from lugging around
two boys all day.

05:02.080 --> 05:05.000
Oh, baby weightlifting.
I would buy that DVD.

05:05.290 --> 05:07.330
- -Excuse me.

05:07.790 --> 05:09.210
-SSA Rossi.
-Cider.

05:09.670 --> 05:12.080
Hey, Dad, it's me.-Joy?

05:12.080 --> 05:14.620
Yeah. This is my work cell.
Sorry you didn't recognize the number.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.210
Well, everything okay?

05:16.210 --> 05:18.250
Are you still at that
conference in New York?

05:18.250 --> 05:21.120
Uh, no, actually. We need to talk.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.040
-Are you at your office?-Yeah.

05:23.040 --> 05:24.540
Great. So am I.

05:25.380 --> 05:28.170
Okay, so it started with a long form piece
that I'm writing for Esquire

05:28.170 --> 05:30.460
on campus violence against women.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.080
After the whole UVA debacle,

05:32.080 --> 05:34.540
my editor told me I needed to
triple source everything.

05:34.540 --> 05:37.290
And that's when I came across
this pattern.

05:37.290 --> 05:40.460
Missing freshmen and sophomores,
all women.

05:40.460 --> 05:41.620
Four over nine years.

05:41.620 --> 05:43.920
They were taken from different
East Coast campuses.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.830
By the time their families realize
that they're missing,

05:45.830 --> 05:47.080
the trail is cold.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.290
So I put out an alert
on campus chat rooms,

05:50.290 --> 05:53.710
and this morning I got a call about her.

05:56.420 --> 05:57.540
Bahni Desai.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.000
Her sister said she went missing last
night from Judy Temple College.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.790
What do the campus police think?

06:02.790 --> 06:05.250
It hasn't been 24 hours,
so there's nothing they can do.

06:06.290 --> 06:10.290
Look, it might be a coincidence,
but I have cried with four families,

06:10.290 --> 06:11.920
and I don't want hers to be number five.

06:14.580 --> 06:15.920
Give me a second.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.080
-We haven't been invited in.
-No.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.380
And the missing student might be fine.

06:22.330 --> 06:23.420
She might.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.420
I know I'm asking a lot,

06:26.540 --> 06:28.330
but Joy is my daughter.

06:28.330 --> 06:31.710
Look, all I'm saying is that
we talk to campus police, friends,

06:31.710 --> 06:32.920
rule out any foul play.

06:33.170 --> 06:35.250
And we could get answers
a lot faster than Joy could.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.420
Exactly.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.170
So, what do you say?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.880
"We are all sharks, circling,

07:53.880 --> 07:56.750
"and waiting for traces of blood
to appear in the water."

07:56.750 --> 07:57.920
Allan Clark.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.880
Four cases in nine years. How come
this hasn't been on our radar?

08:01.210 --> 08:04.500
Because the disappearances were in
different states with different M.O.s.

08:04.500 --> 08:08.750
The first missing woman
was Kathy Miller from NYU in 2006.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.500
So what's the plan
once we land on campus?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.540
Track Bahni's movements.
Campus police checked her room.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.170
She's not there.
They taped it off for you.

08:14.170 --> 08:15.580
What about her cell phone?

08:15.960 --> 08:18.120
It just pinged in her room overnight.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.420
Strange for millennials to go anywhere
without a phone.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.290
No credit card activity.
I've confirmed with all ticket agencies.

08:23.290 --> 08:26.290
She didn't take a boat,
bus, blimp, or plane last night.

08:26.290 --> 08:30.330
Oh! Dean's office just sent us her file
from Judy Temple College.

08:30.330 --> 08:32.620
It looks like... Oh, dear.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.790
-Looks like what?
-She voluntarily withdrew.

08:44.670 --> 08:47.580
-Dad, this is Bahni's sister, Aasia.
-Thank you for coming.

08:47.580 --> 08:48.960
Thank you for helping.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.620
We were supposed to meet in D.C.,
this morning.

08:51.620 --> 08:54.250
After two hours of Bahni's mobile
going to voicemail,

08:54.250 --> 08:55.580
I called the campus police.

08:55.580 --> 08:58.250
The phone is in the room, but she isn't.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.830
There's something else
we need to talk about.

09:01.790 --> 09:04.880
Did she tell you she was withdrawing
from school?

09:05.580 --> 09:08.330
-She was?
-She got a B-plus on her midterm.

09:08.330 --> 09:09.920
She thought her world was over.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.120
Aasia, you never told me that.

09:11.120 --> 09:13.040
She picked up extra-credit work and she

09:13.040 --> 09:14.960
was going to withdraw
her request on Monday.

09:15.380 --> 09:18.790
This, whatever's happening,
it isn't related to that.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.790
-I need you to believe me.
-I do.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.540
Excuse me.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.580
I have to say something.
You're not gonna like hearing it.

09:33.670 --> 09:38.000
Sometimes emotion can cloud
our judgment in an investigation.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.830
We see smoke, but there's no fire.

09:41.540 --> 09:45.460
So, you don't think this is related
to the other cases?

09:45.460 --> 09:47.620
I'm not saying that... Yet.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.500
You and I are going
to take this as far as it will go.

09:52.920 --> 09:54.500
She definitely didn't plan
on leaving town.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.120
Her clothes, shoes, and luggage
are all still here.

09:57.120 --> 09:59.000
Well, it looks like she was
trying on different outfits.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.540
Miniskirts, heels.
She was clearly going out.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.960
But why not take her phone? She'd
need it to meet up with her friends.

10:05.170 --> 10:06.420
Unless her friends
were already here.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.120
Reid, same textbooks, different names.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.540
-She wasn't studying alone.
-Might be the last person who saw her.

10:17.460 --> 10:19.960
Paddy Morris, this is the FBI.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.380
Very funny, Josh.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.500
It's too early for this...

10:30.620 --> 10:32.170
You're not Josh.

10:37.540 --> 10:39.250
Another left and another right!

10:50.500 --> 10:52.250
Four times...

10:57.500 --> 10:59.040
Tommy?

11:00.540 --> 11:01.790
Is that you?

11:34.250 --> 11:35.750
No.

11:40.880 --> 11:42.790
-Get in.
- No!

12:11.080 --> 12:12.540
Shut up! Shh!

12:21.710 --> 12:23.080
You shut up!

12:39.040 --> 12:41.420
I was with her last night. She was fine.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.960
Any idea why she left
her cell phone in her room?

12:43.960 --> 12:47.120
We didn't take purses,
and we didn't have pockets in our skirts.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.710
Okay, walk us through the night.

12:48.710 --> 12:50.790
You guys were studying
before you went out?

12:51.120 --> 12:52.330
Yeah. Um...

12:52.790 --> 12:54.170
I knew about this party.

12:55.880 --> 12:56.920
She didn't want to go.

12:57.290 --> 12:59.330
He said he's definitely gonna be here.
Do I look okay?

12:59.330 --> 13:00.710
You're perfect.

13:00.710 --> 13:03.460
We can only stay for an hour.
I'm meeting my sister super early.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.380
Okay, fine. Stop stressing.

13:05.380 --> 13:07.670
Show off your assets, please?

13:07.670 --> 13:09.580
This is the first time I've seen you
dressing for fun.

13:09.580 --> 13:11.000
Okay! That's enough.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.250
Get ready to have your mind blown,
because this party is going to be epic.

13:15.420 --> 13:18.830
This guy was in class today
asking why his python encoder...

13:22.790 --> 13:24.120
The girls are here.

13:30.080 --> 13:32.080
So, it wasn't epic?

13:33.000 --> 13:35.960
It was most decidedly not epic.

13:35.960 --> 13:37.500
Did you two come back to the dorm?

13:37.960 --> 13:40.620
No. I made her stay.

13:41.960 --> 13:43.080
Why?

13:43.080 --> 13:47.080
There was this tennis guy
that I'd been trading tweets with.

13:48.500 --> 13:49.880
He said he'd show up, but he was late,

13:49.880 --> 13:52.120
and then the later it got,
the more I drank.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.250
No...

13:59.250 --> 14:00.380
How much did you have?

14:00.380 --> 14:04.170
Her, I don't know,
me, a lot. Until...

14:04.170 --> 14:06.920
Let's get this party start... Oh.

14:07.380 --> 14:11.080
-Peter! -Honey, how's it going? I...

14:11.080 --> 14:13.170
-Paddy.
-Hi, hi. Right.

14:14.460 --> 14:17.040
Hey. I'm going now.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.500
-What?
-I'm going.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.620
Sure.

14:19.620 --> 14:23.120
Did anyone walk out after her,
maybe try to escort her?

14:23.790 --> 14:24.880
Not that I saw.

14:27.790 --> 14:31.460
- God, it's my fault, isn't it?
-No, it's not.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.460
But there's still a way you can help us.

14:33.460 --> 14:35.330
Anything. Name it.

14:35.920 --> 14:37.210
Where was the party?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.040
Okay, mapping the route
from the not-so-awesome

14:39.040 --> 14:40.880
house party to Bahni's dorm.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.620
What are those icons
there along the street?

14:42.620 --> 14:43.830
Security cameras.

14:43.830 --> 14:45.330
They line the perimeter of the campus.

14:45.330 --> 14:48.080
And to answer your next question,
that is real good news for us

14:48.080 --> 14:51.380
because it means that we can pull
the feed from last night. And presto.

14:51.380 --> 14:52.710
00 a.m. And go forward.

14:53.170 --> 14:54.460
Roger.

14:56.210 --> 14:57.420
I've got her.

15:01.170 --> 15:03.080
Looks like she's stumbling a little.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.380
Drunk, alone at night. She's a low-risk
vic in a high-risk environment.

15:10.620 --> 15:12.580
Wait, wait. Right there. Stop.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.380
All right, back it up.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.920
Yeah. Can you enhance that?

15:33.790 --> 15:35.250
Oh, my God.

15:35.250 --> 15:37.500
Garcia, what's the next
camera they show up on?

15:37.500 --> 15:38.580
Uh...

15:46.620 --> 15:49.040
-None of them.
-Joy, you were right to come to us.

15:49.290 --> 15:51.460
We'll open a case and coordinate
with campus and Alexandria P.D.

15:51.830 --> 15:54.040
I'll make sure this is their top priority.

15:55.540 --> 15:56.620
Thank you.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.170
I'll be right back.

16:20.330 --> 16:24.080
I went to Darfur on assignment.
Did I ever tell you that?

16:24.580 --> 16:25.710
No.

16:25.710 --> 16:29.290
It was just after I was married,
before Kai was born.

16:31.460 --> 16:34.380
I saw the worst a human being
can do to another.

16:35.580 --> 16:39.170
But this is still so...

16:40.120 --> 16:42.380
The first disappearance you uncovered,

16:43.040 --> 16:45.580
Kathy Miller, NYU, 2006.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.170
You went to NYU in 2006.

16:50.830 --> 16:53.540
That's why you started this investigation.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.250
Tell me about Kathy.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.380
I didn't know her, really.

17:00.250 --> 17:02.120
We just had one class together.

17:02.670 --> 17:06.960
Even though there was never a body,
her parents had a memorial.

17:08.460 --> 17:09.920
And...

17:09.920 --> 17:13.120
I went 'cause she was so young.

17:16.500 --> 17:17.920
And it could have been me.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.960
So what do you think the chances are
of finding Bahni?

17:22.330 --> 17:24.250
Better because
it was reported right away.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.670
I want to tell you we'll find her,
but realistically I can't.

17:29.380 --> 17:30.620
But we have a picture now.

17:30.620 --> 17:32.880
We'll build a profile.
We'll go to the press.

17:32.880 --> 17:36.920
Bahni has a shot
that she wouldn't have without you.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.670
And here he comes,

17:47.670 --> 17:48.830
surging down the stretch to home,

17:48.830 --> 17:50.670
just in time, going full out.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.080
Jockey Carroll pulling out all the stops.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
What are you doin' up there?

18:17.500 --> 18:19.830
If you scream, I'll kill you.

18:45.790 --> 18:46.880
Look...

18:48.120 --> 18:49.830
I don't want to hurt you, okay?

18:51.170 --> 18:52.670
I'm hungry!

18:54.040 --> 18:55.420
Get your ass down here!

18:58.080 --> 18:59.670
Get me some food!

19:02.080 --> 19:03.920
-Do you hear me?
-Okay!

19:28.540 --> 19:29.710
This is your room now.

19:47.380 --> 19:48.500
I'm keeping you.

20:22.250 --> 20:23.420
This is the last spot
she was seen.

20:23.420 --> 20:26.960
The next camera is 100 feet down,
which makes this the abduction zone.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.670
Well, Alexandria police
searched the buildings, nothing there.

20:29.670 --> 20:30.880
Well, if she got in the car with him,

20:30.880 --> 20:32.580
they would have shown
up on the camera down the street.

20:32.580 --> 20:36.420
But shoving her in the trunk of a car
out in the open like this, it's too risky.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.710
That leaves this.

20:48.790 --> 20:50.330
Everything okay?

20:50.330 --> 20:53.500
Actually, no.
My mom's not doing so well.

20:53.500 --> 20:56.580
The doctors have had to change her
medicine three times

20:56.580 --> 20:58.540
to try to stabilize the schizophrenia.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.710
Spence, why didn't you say anything?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.170
-I didn't want to bother you.
-Okay.

21:04.170 --> 21:06.330
That's never possible. Got it?

21:07.670 --> 21:09.580
How long has this been going on?

21:09.580 --> 21:11.580
It's gotten really bad the past few weeks.

21:12.710 --> 21:15.330
Look, the minute we are done here,
you need to go help her.

21:15.330 --> 21:17.120
-She needs you.
-I know.

21:17.120 --> 21:18.250
Right now so does Bahni.

21:20.580 --> 21:22.380
All right, let's think this through.

21:22.380 --> 21:25.540
All right, if he took her out
this way, it's a busier street.

21:25.540 --> 21:27.330
The traffic was lighter last night,

21:27.330 --> 21:29.670
but it's still a risk to abduct someone
in plain sight.

21:29.670 --> 21:33.250
So he was able to control a drunk
woman and it didn't look suspicious.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.330
He probably just put
his arm around her and walked off.

21:35.330 --> 21:38.040
She was too drunk to even realize
she was in danger.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.830
You know, if this was
just about the assault,

21:39.830 --> 21:41.290
he could have done that
back in the alley.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.120
I think this has gotta be
some sort of long-term play.

21:44.830 --> 21:46.250
Then he's been watching Bahni,

21:46.540 --> 21:48.330
looking for the perfect opportunity.

21:48.330 --> 21:49.710
Well, he certainly found it last night.

21:49.710 --> 21:53.000
She's a straight A student
who never drinks and rarely goes out.

21:57.960 --> 22:00.250
Okay, so if he watched
and waited to take Bahni,

22:00.250 --> 22:02.170
we should be looking for offenders
with precursor crimes

22:02.170 --> 22:03.330
of stalking and peeping.

22:03.330 --> 22:05.460
Greater metro area creeps coming up.

22:05.460 --> 22:06.830
He's patient and organized.

22:06.830 --> 22:09.580
He'll have a plan for when she sobers
up and becomes non-compliant.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.960
He'll isolate her so it's easier
to be dependent on him.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.420
She's the most important
thing in the world to him right now.

22:15.420 --> 22:17.250
We need to get him to see her
as a person.

22:18.120 --> 22:21.380
The FBI is working to locate this woman,

22:21.380 --> 22:24.830
19-year-old sophomore Bahni Desai.

22:24.830 --> 22:27.330
She went missing last night
from Judy Temple College.

22:27.330 --> 22:30.120
We're also trying to identify this man.

22:30.120 --> 22:33.250
We believe he has information
that will help us locate Bahni.

22:34.080 --> 22:35.670
Isn't this man also a suspect?

22:35.670 --> 22:39.380
Right now he's a person of interest,
strictly a witness.

22:39.380 --> 22:42.380
Did he abduct her

22:42.380 --> 22:45.040
Our focus right now is on Bahni,

22:45.040 --> 22:48.210
which is why her sister Aasia
would like to say a few words.

22:51.880 --> 22:56.420
All my parents want, all I want,
is to see Bahni again soon.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.170
Please, call the hotline
number if you can help.

23:01.170 --> 23:02.380
When she arrived at school...

23:02.380 --> 23:05.920
That girl's probably chopped up
under the floorboards somewhere.

23:06.540 --> 23:09.750
She always knows how to make
everyone around her smile,

23:10.210 --> 23:11.420
especially children.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.620
What... Jeez, you can't do anything
right, you stupid bastard.

23:15.620 --> 23:17.170
And you're a worse cook
than your mother.

23:17.170 --> 23:22.580
Why don't you just take this slop
and clean it up, you son of a bitch.

23:26.880 --> 23:29.040
You get back here and clean it up!
You hear me?

23:29.380 --> 23:32.670
Bahni, if you can hear me,
we love you very much,

23:32.670 --> 23:36.710
and we'll never stop searching for you
until we have you back in our arms.

23:36.710 --> 23:39.750
That was an FBI
announcement regarding the abduction

23:39.750 --> 23:42.620
-of 19-year-old Bahni Desai.-

23:42.620 --> 23:44.330
We'll be coming back with...

23:54.670 --> 23:56.040
Anything from the hotline calls?

23:56.040 --> 23:59.170
Nothing legit. But there's a walk-in
that security thinks you should talk to.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.500
-Can I help you?
-I'm the man in the video.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.960
I saw the press conference.
You wanted to talk to me?

24:13.620 --> 24:16.330
This is Agent Jareau, Mr. Burnett.
She'll be joining us.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.040
Call me Sam.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.710
-Is that your birthstone?
-Uh, it's my son's.

24:22.420 --> 24:23.710
It's beautiful.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.710
Thank you.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.080
So, uh, Mr. Burnett, can you just...

24:29.080 --> 24:31.420
00 a.m.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.920
I drive a cab. I'm Medallion 3469.

24:34.920 --> 24:37.040
And moonlight as a sober cabdriver.

24:37.460 --> 24:40.790
It's a service local bars
and campuses provide

24:40.790 --> 24:44.580
to make sure kids get home safely
if they've gotten stupid.

24:44.580 --> 24:47.460
Front Street's a good spot to post up
and wait for fares.

24:47.460 --> 24:49.120
I was checking my phone
when I saw her.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.710
-Bahni.
-I don't know. I guess.

24:52.670 --> 24:55.330
What I noticed was
how out of it she was.

24:55.330 --> 24:56.540
I went to help.

24:56.540 --> 24:59.290
Then some dude came up
and walked off with her.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.920
It seemed like they knew one another.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.710
Can you describe him?
-Big. My height.

25:05.330 --> 25:08.170
He was wearing a hoodie,
so I couldn't see his face.

25:08.170 --> 25:10.960
But, I mean, that's the guy
you should be looking for, right?

25:10.960 --> 25:13.250
Okay, explain something to me.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.290
Um, why did you step back
into the doorway?

25:17.580 --> 25:18.710
What do you mean?

25:18.710 --> 25:20.580
Well, you saw Bahni coming,

25:20.580 --> 25:23.210
you stepped back to let her pass.
Then you followed her.

25:27.210 --> 25:28.250
Listen,

25:28.790 --> 25:31.250
I came in here because you asked.

25:31.250 --> 25:32.710
Maybe that was a mistake.

25:34.620 --> 25:39.080
After that guy went off with that girl,
I got a fare, which I took.

25:39.080 --> 25:41.540
My cab has GPS. You can check it out.

25:42.790 --> 25:45.250
If you don't believe me,
maybe I should get a lawyer.

25:46.040 --> 25:49.710
His GPS and his cell phone
confirm his whereabouts, sir.

25:49.710 --> 25:51.830
And this was five minutes later.

25:53.250 --> 25:56.750
Yeah. No way he'd have Bahni
in the trunk when he had customers.

25:58.420 --> 25:59.750
You let him go?

25:59.750 --> 26:01.210
His alibi checks out.

26:01.210 --> 26:04.920
Dad, you said Bahni had a shot
because we had a picture and a profile.

26:04.920 --> 26:08.710
And in this case, the picture does not
match the profile.

26:08.710 --> 26:10.170
He followed her, Dad.

26:10.170 --> 26:13.750
There is something off about this guy,
but he did not take Bahni.

26:13.750 --> 26:14.960
Did you check his priors?

26:15.790 --> 26:17.080
No arrests at all.

26:18.330 --> 26:21.920
-Joy, I'm doing everything I can.
-I know you are, Dad.

26:24.420 --> 26:25.620
I need some air.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.580
The beauty of this one is

26:33.580 --> 26:36.040
it covers the fruit
or whatever you're slicing,

26:36.040 --> 26:38.580
so that your fingers
are nowhere near the blade.

26:38.580 --> 26:39.880
Well, I...

26:47.500 --> 26:49.330
That's amazing!

26:49.330 --> 26:51.920
And it's all uniform, all the same size.

26:52.250 --> 26:53.620
Now, just...

27:02.920 --> 27:04.120
Don't touch that!

27:04.580 --> 27:07.380
Never, never touch that!

27:07.380 --> 27:09.380
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

27:10.250 --> 27:12.500
-Anyone see Joy

27:12.500 --> 27:15.670
She asked about Sam's rap sheet.
At the time, I didn't think it through.

27:15.670 --> 27:17.080
But she is a journalist.

27:17.080 --> 27:18.330
And Sam's a lead.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.620
-Pull him up, Garcia.
-Okay, Sam Burnett.

27:21.620 --> 27:24.380
No record.
Just his address and his date of birth.

27:24.380 --> 27:25.960
He's about the same age as Joy.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.420
That's it. Where did he go to college?

27:27.750 --> 27:30.540
He dropped out of NYU in 2006.

27:32.500 --> 27:34.040
The same time Kathy Miller
went missing.

27:34.040 --> 27:35.710
Okay, but hold up. What are we saying?

27:35.710 --> 27:38.420
But he could be an UnSub.

27:38.420 --> 27:40.170
When he talked about Bahni's
abduction,

27:40.170 --> 27:42.380
he wasn't concerned, he was jealous.

27:42.380 --> 27:44.920
We have two separate UnSubs
in a target-rich environment.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.500
And Joy's going to confront
the one we know.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.880
Garcia, ping her phone.

27:51.750 --> 27:54.210
She's in the same alley
that Bahni was last seen.

27:54.210 --> 27:56.120
Now ping Sam's.

28:10.120 --> 28:11.830
Hey.
-Hey.

28:12.170 --> 28:14.210
-Thanks for meeting me here.
-My pleasure.

28:15.120 --> 28:18.620
-What paper was this for, again?
-It's a magazine, actually.

28:18.620 --> 28:21.670
So my sources tell me that
you were the last person to see Bahni.

28:21.670 --> 28:23.960
-What did you see first?
-Just her alone.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.000
I wasn't sure if she was drunk or what.

28:27.000 --> 28:29.920
But then that guy came up,
put his arm around her,

28:29.920 --> 28:31.250
and walked her in here.

28:35.710 --> 28:37.500
And what, they just disappeared?

28:38.500 --> 28:40.040
Did he put her in a car?

28:42.500 --> 28:44.670
-What did you see?
-Everything.

28:46.620 --> 28:47.670
I saw everything.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.710
-It's down here.
-What?

28:51.380 --> 28:52.920
Why didn't you tell the authorities?

28:52.920 --> 28:55.080
Because I could have
helped her and I didn't,

28:55.080 --> 28:56.460
and I feel bad about that.

28:56.460 --> 29:00.580
I mean, who sees everything
and does nothing?

29:00.580 --> 29:02.210
I could have made
a difference last night.

29:02.210 --> 29:05.750
-Instead, I just walked away.
-Well, it isn't too late.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.750
Tell them whatever you can
and it could help.

29:07.750 --> 29:09.580
Well, one thing I remember.

29:10.670 --> 29:13.620
When she got right here, he did this.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.960
Oh!

29:20.620 --> 29:21.710
What the hell are you doing?

29:21.960 --> 29:24.170
You said you wanted
to know what he did,

29:24.170 --> 29:25.580
and I'm showing you.

29:30.290 --> 29:31.790
You like this, don't you?

29:32.460 --> 29:33.620
What are you talking about?

29:33.620 --> 29:36.000
Look at you. You're excited.

29:37.460 --> 29:40.420
-Is this what you did to Kathy Miller

29:42.000 --> 29:44.830
Haven't heard that name in a long time.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.710
I remember her.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.710
You should. You killed her.

29:51.960 --> 29:54.830
All I said was I remember her.

29:56.080 --> 29:57.960
Everyone remembers
what happened to her.

30:02.460 --> 30:04.790
We were just talking, agents.

30:04.790 --> 30:07.830
Sam Burnett, you're under arrest.

30:07.830 --> 30:10.670
-For what?
-Assault. Rossi, I got him.

30:14.420 --> 30:16.040
What were you thinking?

30:16.540 --> 30:19.330
That's him, Dad. I know it is.

30:19.330 --> 30:22.380
Then you definitely don't follow him
down an alley!

30:22.380 --> 30:23.880
You're a parent, for God's sake.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.880
If Kai did something this...

30:26.670 --> 30:31.540
There's no other word for it
than this stupid, how would you feel?

30:36.080 --> 30:38.880
There's more to this than Kathy Miller,
isn't there?

30:45.620 --> 30:47.380
The week before she disappeared,

30:48.250 --> 30:49.670
I went to a frat party.

30:50.580 --> 30:53.960
I got drunk, I walked home alone...

30:55.710 --> 31:01.580
And some guy in a ski mask grabbed
me and dragged me into the bushes.

31:03.040 --> 31:05.210
And I screamed and screamed.

31:05.920 --> 31:09.960
And some voice in my head told me
that I needed to get up

31:09.960 --> 31:11.920
because no one
was coming to rescue me.

31:12.920 --> 31:18.580
And so I fought and I scratched at him
and I jabbed my thumb in his eye,

31:18.580 --> 31:19.830
and then he ran off.

31:23.380 --> 31:26.170
-But you know what I didn't do?
-You didn't report it.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.580
At college they talk about drunk girls
a certain way.

31:32.880 --> 31:35.380
Like it's their fault
if they get attacked.

31:36.040 --> 31:37.540
It's so unfair.

31:38.670 --> 31:41.120
Especially when a week later,
another girl goes missing

31:41.120 --> 31:42.710
because I didn't tell anyone.

31:46.460 --> 31:49.250
-It's not the same guy.
-Dad...

31:51.580 --> 31:54.710
The guy who hurt Kathy was organized.

31:54.710 --> 31:56.540
He had a place to take her.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.040
The dirtbag who attacked you
was impulsive.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.710
He hadn't thought that far ahead.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.040
Well, none of this is helping Bahni.

32:04.040 --> 32:07.580
Unless, Sam gave you
some new details.

32:08.290 --> 32:10.210
Kathy Miller?

32:10.500 --> 32:13.500
I haven't heard that name in a long time.

32:15.120 --> 32:18.120
-It's how he said it.
-He got off toying with you.

32:18.790 --> 32:20.210
I really thought I had more than this.

32:20.210 --> 32:24.120
Go back to the beginning, right before
he admits to seeing everything.

32:24.120 --> 32:25.960
And what,
they just disappeared?

32:26.790 --> 32:28.250
Did he put her in a car?

32:30.920 --> 32:32.120
What did you see?

32:32.120 --> 32:34.120
He paused
when you asked about the car.

32:34.120 --> 32:38.250
It's the only time he did that. Everything
else, he answered without hesitation.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.080
Maybe he avoided the question

32:40.080 --> 32:42.120
because he didn't want
to give you a clue.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.540
Penelope, we need you
to pull up the security cameras again.

32:47.540 --> 32:51.500
Run registrations on all vehicles
on or around the campus after midnight.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.000
This is...

33:10.000 --> 33:12.380
This is what I always order when I...

33:12.380 --> 33:13.420
I know.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.250
How long have you been watching me?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.500
Long enough to know that I wanted you.

33:40.960 --> 33:42.290
I'm trusting you.

34:03.880 --> 34:05.330
I'm looking at the vehicles
from earlier

34:05.330 --> 34:07.710
and there's nothing extraordinary about
them or their owners.

34:07.710 --> 34:09.330
Any of them belong
to Judy Temple students?

34:09.330 --> 34:12.170
Two, but we already know
they went home for the weekend.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.210
Some of Sam Burnett's story is true.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.880
The UnSub likely walked off

34:15.880 --> 34:17.330
with his arm around Bahni,
and it's highly doubtful

34:17.330 --> 34:19.420
that he would have taken the chance
to hurt her in public.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.920
Yeah, but then they just disappeared.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.880
Well, because he took her away,
likely in a vehicle that fit in.

34:23.880 --> 34:25.830
Campus security should
have a list of vehicles

34:25.830 --> 34:27.500
that are authorized
to drive onto campus.

34:27.500 --> 34:29.420
Cross-check those against your list.

34:29.420 --> 34:31.500
Checking registrations.

34:31.500 --> 34:34.710
There's a car.
It looks like it's in the neighborhood.

34:34.710 --> 34:36.710
It delivers Chinese food to campus.

34:36.710 --> 34:37.830
Does Bahni order from them?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.920
-All the flippin' time.
-Who's it registered to?

34:43.000 --> 34:45.420
22-year-old Tom Larson.
No criminal record.

34:45.420 --> 34:46.460
Check for juvenile offenses.

34:47.170 --> 34:49.000
Oh. Bingo.

34:49.000 --> 34:53.170
Lots of misdemeanor,
peeping offenses in his teens.

34:53.670 --> 34:55.330
It doesn't look like it's a coincidence.

34:55.330 --> 34:57.250
And every time he got busted,
he'd end up in the hospital

34:57.250 --> 34:58.580
with bruises and broken bones.

34:58.580 --> 35:00.830
Probably an abusive father.
Was child services ever called?

35:01.080 --> 35:05.790
Looks like the mom explained it away,
until she committed suicide years ago.

35:05.790 --> 35:07.960
You want to bet that
she received the brunt of his abuse?

35:07.960 --> 35:09.210
Oh, no takers on that bet.

35:09.210 --> 35:11.210
Looks like the elder Larson
had a heart attack last year.

35:11.210 --> 35:14.750
According to medical records, uh,
the son is the primary caregiver.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.120
Caring for his own father who beat him,

35:16.120 --> 35:17.710
it was only a matter
of time before he snapped.

35:17.710 --> 35:19.500
We don't have two monsters,
we have three.

35:19.500 --> 35:21.290
Garcia,
send the address to Rossi and JJ.

35:33.710 --> 35:34.960
What are you doing?

35:50.540 --> 35:51.580
Ah!

35:54.250 --> 35:56.000
-No!
-

35:56.670 --> 35:59.460
Help! Help!

36:04.290 --> 36:05.920
What the hell's going on up here?

36:06.460 --> 36:08.500
Please, help me.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.210
That's that...
That's that girl from the news.

36:11.210 --> 36:13.750
-Dad, you...
-What have you done?

36:13.750 --> 36:16.120
-Ah!
-Thank you. Thank you.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.880
Tommy. Close the door, Tommy.

36:23.880 --> 36:24.920
We gotta get rid of her.

36:33.170 --> 36:35.250
No. No!

36:43.920 --> 36:45.040
We're 3 miles out.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.290
Stay away from me!

36:53.290 --> 36:54.420
Dad, don't.

36:54.750 --> 36:57.620
You made this mess,
and we're gonna clean it up.

36:57.620 --> 36:59.620
No! She's mine.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.170
-Not any more.
-I want to keep her.

37:03.420 --> 37:04.540
Dad, don't!

37:07.580 --> 37:09.040
What, are you crazy?

37:09.710 --> 37:12.170
You don't record what we're about to do.

37:13.710 --> 37:14.960
You moron.

37:16.170 --> 37:17.920
Grow a pair and be a man.

37:17.920 --> 37:20.790
-We gotta clean this mess up.
-

37:28.670 --> 37:30.250
How's this for being a man?

37:52.460 --> 37:54.330
FBI! Drop your weapon!

37:54.620 --> 37:56.460
Get it off, get it off, get it off.

37:56.460 --> 37:58.620
-Get it off, get it off, get it off.
-I need a knife.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.750
He's gone, right

38:04.210 --> 38:06.500
Do you even know what you did, Tom?

38:06.500 --> 38:08.250
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

38:08.500 --> 38:09.540
Okay.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.380
Yeah, I knew.

38:15.880 --> 38:18.670
There you go. It's okay.

38:21.210 --> 38:22.500
Aasia.

38:39.500 --> 38:42.040
I got nothing to say
until my lawyer gets here.

38:42.040 --> 38:45.120
Except, the little recording that bitch
made is inadmissible.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.290
Even I know that.

38:46.290 --> 38:49.170
Maybe so, but she's my daughter.

38:49.880 --> 38:53.080
And that recording gave us probable
cause for a search warrant.

38:54.170 --> 38:56.040
So you have a thing for necklaces.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.040
See this?

39:00.170 --> 39:01.500
Kathy Miller's initials.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.460
Her grandmother gave it to her.

39:05.880 --> 39:06.920
All right, let's make a deal.

39:08.420 --> 39:09.460
Let's not.

39:09.960 --> 39:12.670
We tied him to the murder
of three of the victims,

39:12.670 --> 39:14.750
including Kathy Miller.

39:17.000 --> 39:19.170
Look, we need to talk.

39:19.420 --> 39:21.670
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I went off to meet him.

39:21.670 --> 39:23.380
You're right. It was...

39:23.380 --> 39:26.000
-It was stupid and reckless.
-That's not what I meant.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.000
What you survived in college is trauma.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.670
It doesn't just go away
because we do good for somebody else.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.120
You need to talk to someone.

39:34.670 --> 39:36.620
Like your old man, maybe.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.000
Because I won't lecture.

39:41.330 --> 39:42.540
I'll just listen.

39:43.790 --> 39:45.960
- -

39:45.960 --> 39:47.170
Hang on.

39:48.170 --> 39:49.620
That's my editor.

39:52.080 --> 39:53.250
This is Joy Rossi.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.170
Uh-huh.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.210
Yeah.

39:58.040 --> 39:59.920
Just send me the latest version.

40:01.120 --> 40:02.540
Thanks.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.250
Joy Rossi?

40:07.080 --> 40:08.830
I didn't get to use
the name Rossi growing up,

40:08.830 --> 40:10.790
so I thought I'd try a new by-line.

40:12.710 --> 40:13.830
What do you think?

40:13.830 --> 40:16.920
I think I need to get
a subscription to Esquire.

40:18.920 --> 40:23.000
"To a father,
nothing is dearer than a daughter."

40:23.420 --> 40:24.710
Euripides.

40:31.290 --> 40:33.000
You were that little once.

40:33.000 --> 40:36.380
It seems impossible, doesn't it,
that we all start out so helpless.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.540
And we all end the same way.

40:41.170 --> 40:42.210
Yeah.

40:42.460 --> 40:43.500
Are you gonna call your mom?

40:45.330 --> 40:46.500
It's not too late there, is it?

40:46.880 --> 40:49.040
-Tell her I said hi.
-I will.

40:54.580 --> 40:55.670
Hey, Mom.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.210
I'm good. How are you feeling?

41:00.540 --> 41:03.880
What do you think about me coming out
to visit for a little while?

41:05.540 --> 41:06.920
Hey, baby girl...

41:21.080 --> 41:22.420
Leave it off, please?

41:24.420 --> 41:27.500
-What are you doing -I'm scared.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.120
Not the unnerved-but-you-know-I'll-pull-
through kind of scared.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.420
I'm scared scared.

41:34.420 --> 41:37.080
Hey, I'm right here.

41:38.080 --> 41:39.460
Talk to me.

41:39.460 --> 41:42.000
Hotch told me to review everything
that I had on the Dirty Dozen.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.790
So I went back to look at the botnets
I used for the original search.

41:45.080 --> 41:46.250
Botnets, what's that?

41:46.250 --> 41:47.830
Think linked computer systems.

41:47.830 --> 41:51.460
Completely randomized with anonymous
proxy servers so no one can hack me.

41:51.460 --> 41:52.620
Make sense?

41:52.620 --> 41:53.880
Mmm-hmm.

41:53.880 --> 41:55.580
I don't pay attention
to how many botnets I use.

41:55.580 --> 41:59.290
It's like when you google something,
you don't pay attention to the numbers,

41:59.290 --> 42:00.790
you just pay attention
to the search results.

42:00.790 --> 42:03.920
But when I went back
to look at the digital breadcrumbs,

42:03.920 --> 42:05.330
someone was counting me.

42:09.170 --> 42:11.080
I used 12 botnets, Derek.

42:13.250 --> 42:14.500
You're the Dirty Dozen?

42:16.170 --> 42:20.170
My filters work good, but if these
hitmen are as good as I think they are,

42:20.170 --> 42:22.170
they could use a reverse worm protocol.

42:22.170 --> 42:23.580
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:23.580 --> 42:25.080
Would they know it was you?

42:27.000 --> 42:29.960
They would know it was someone at
fbi.gov at Quantico.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.960
That's why I shut everything down.

42:32.380 --> 42:35.120
-Because it's just a matter of time...
-No. No.

42:35.620 --> 42:37.330
I'm not about to let
anything happen to you.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.670
They killed Montolo at a supermax
and you were right there.

42:43.920 --> 42:45.830
You can't stop them, Derek.

42:46.460 --> 42:48.170
No one can stop them.
