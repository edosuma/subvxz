[Townsend]  Third of August, 1959.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.800
Dearest Margaret,
I write to you with a heavy heart,

02:57.880 --> 02:59.080
in hopes of preparing you...

02:59.160 --> 03:01.600
-[door opens]
-...for an announcement I am to make.

03:02.240 --> 03:07.240
As you are aware, I have just returned
from a year abroad around the world.

03:08.600 --> 03:12.160
A young woman named Marie-Luce
accompanied me on this trip

03:12.240 --> 03:14.640
as my secretary and photographer.

03:14.720 --> 03:19.000
She is someone I have known
for a few years now

03:19.080 --> 03:22.240
and her companionship has been
one of the few joys in my life.

03:24.200 --> 03:27.000
I have decided to ask her to marry me.

03:28.080 --> 03:32.160
Dearest Margaret, I know
you will feel betrayed by this decision.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.160
When we parted,
I could never have imagined

03:35.240 --> 03:37.520
falling in love with anyone else.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.800
But these years apart

03:39.880 --> 03:43.760
and the knowledge that I will
never be allowed to marry you,

03:43.840 --> 03:45.880
[his voice fades]  or even, in time...

03:57.760 --> 03:59.440

05:17.760 --> 05:21.760
[footsteps approach]

05:37.640 --> 05:39.520
-[Margaret] I, uh...
-[Tony] Mm?

05:39.960 --> 05:42.760
[Margaret] I received a letter
this morning from Peter Townsend.

05:42.840 --> 05:45.000
[Tony] Ha! Group Captain Bore?

05:45.080 --> 05:46.840
-Peter's not a bore.
-[Tony shouts] What?

05:47.920 --> 05:50.800
-I said Peter's not a bore.
-Excuse me.

05:51.280 --> 05:54.880
Straight-backed, obedient, decent.
Missionary fashion, three quick minutes.

05:54.960 --> 05:57.720
And that's your lot. Definitely a bore.
Probably pajamas, too.

05:57.800 --> 05:59.440
He looks like a pajama man.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.160
Striped and ironed.

06:04.520 --> 06:07.280
And? What did he have to say?

06:09.840 --> 06:12.240
[Margaret] He asked my permission
to break our pact.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.040
[Tony] Pact? What pact?

06:14.760 --> 06:18.120
We promised that if we couldn't marry
each other, we'd never marry anyone else.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.040
[Tony] Ah, I see.

06:20.080 --> 06:26.240
Well... he now wishes to be released
from that pledge.

06:26.320 --> 06:27.920
[Tony] To get married?

06:30.120 --> 06:32.440
-Yes.
-Who is the unfortunate?

06:33.760 --> 06:36.440
Some girl he met in Brussels. [scoffs]

06:36.960 --> 06:37.800
[laughs] She's 19.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.280
Really?

06:41.560 --> 06:45.520
At his age?
Isn't that some sort of criminal offense?

06:45.600 --> 06:48.840
Well, he wrote to me so I wouldn't
hear about it from anyone else.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.000
How gallant.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.240
And? How do you feel?

06:55.400 --> 06:59.520
Yes, I feel a bit hurt
that he should have found happiness first.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.160
Ah, don't be.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.160
[kisses]

07:02.240 --> 07:03.840
He hasn't found happiness.

07:03.920 --> 07:06.880
He's found marriage,
the very opposite of happiness.

07:07.960 --> 07:13.040
Ideally it would've been me writing to him
saying that I was the one getting married.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.240
Uh-uh-uh. You said
you didn't want to get married.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.360
"That's what dreary
conventional people do."

07:19.720 --> 07:24.040
You don't think you and I could do it...
unconventionally?

07:24.840 --> 07:26.400
Interestingly?

07:28.040 --> 07:31.960
Christ. Only if we violated
each and every one of the god-awful vows

07:32.040 --> 07:33.760
the Church would make us take.

07:37.560 --> 07:40.440
-[man clears throat] Tony.
-[Tony] Ah, right, yes.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.520
-You have to, uh, open the doors.
-No--

07:42.600 --> 07:44.480
-You ready?
-You can't just leave it there.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.240
Darling, we're half an hour late as it is.

07:46.320 --> 07:49.600
-I've just effectively proposed.
-Oh, we can discuss this another time.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.280
Fine. If what's important to me
isn't a priority for you...

07:54.360 --> 07:56.360
-Is my car still outside?
-[man] Yes, ma'am.

07:56.440 --> 07:58.520
-[Tony] Where are you going?
-[Margaret] Home.

07:58.600 --> 07:59.880
But you came to support  me.

07:59.960 --> 08:02.440
Half those bloody journalists
have only come to see you.

08:02.520 --> 08:06.080
Well, the work will have to speak
for itself. I'm sure it will.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.000
[crowd chatters loudly]

08:11.360 --> 08:13.640
Where's Her Royal Highness gone, Tony?

08:13.720 --> 08:17.480
Oh, it's not really her sort of thing, but
Larry Olivier's here and Alec Guinness.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.520
Marlene Dietrich, anyone?

08:23.760 --> 08:26.480
[man] That's her. Oi! Come on, lads.
She's coming out now.

What a thrill.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.160
Oh, you must come again. It's been so
long. I'd adore it. Much love, much love.

-[woman] Darling.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.200

09:33.280 --> 09:35.680

09:46.400 --> 09:47.880
-[Tony] So...
-[sighs]

09:50.920 --> 09:55.600
You didn't come to my exhibition.
After I reminded you, too.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.320
There was a clash.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.080
-Your brother...
-Half-brother.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.600
...was on parade.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.240
The Irish Guards are on parade
every month.

10:03.320 --> 10:05.560
I have an opening like that once a year.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.600
It was so important to him.

10:09.800 --> 10:11.520
Well, there we are.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.480
Michael.

10:19.280 --> 10:21.480
The notices were favorable.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.160
Very favorable, actually.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.960
-Really? I read  The Times.
-Mm.

10:28.880 --> 10:31.040
The Times  was the only naysayer.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.440
Any mention of her?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.400
Margaret? She wasn't there.

10:40.520 --> 10:41.680
Oh.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.760
[sighs]

10:42.840 --> 10:45.120
-We had a tiff.
-What about?

10:47.840 --> 10:49.560
Marriage, if you must know.

10:49.640 --> 10:50.560
[woman] Mm-hmm.

10:51.960 --> 10:53.960
-She's turned you down.
-No.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.960
The other way round.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.440
Are you mad?

11:06.040 --> 11:08.280
You know, Mummy, for most parents...

11:10.200 --> 11:12.520
there's never anyone good enough
for their children.

13:15.640 --> 13:17.520

13:17.600 --> 13:20.920
[thunder rumbles in the distance]

13:22.200 --> 13:25.320
-[Tony]   So I told Jacqui.
-[woman] How did she take it?

13:25.400 --> 13:29.080
Not lying down. [laughs]

13:29.160 --> 13:31.240
Mind you,
she never takes anything lying down.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.600
Far too conventional.

13:35.520 --> 13:39.760
[sighs] She really is
the most dazzling fuck.

13:39.840 --> 13:43.480
-Evidently.
-What is that supposed to mean?

13:43.560 --> 13:46.960
Well, you've just become so much...

13:48.280 --> 13:50.880
better since seeing her.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.040
-[man] Hear, hear.
-[Tony] Have I?

13:54.120 --> 13:57.000
[man] I really can't keep up anymore.
[kisses]

13:57.080 --> 14:00.280
-[woman] And you're more imaginative.
-[Tony] Am I?

14:01.800 --> 14:05.720
So don't give her up, whatever you do.

14:07.440 --> 14:08.680
I won't.

14:08.760 --> 14:10.880
Speaking of which,
I have to be in London on Thursday

14:10.960 --> 14:12.480
and might have some time after lunch.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.560
Is that a proposition?

14:15.480 --> 14:19.960
It is. Any objections, Mr. Fry?

14:20.040 --> 14:23.160
-[man] None at all, Mrs. Fry.
-[woman laughs]

14:24.400 --> 14:26.000
Can I get back to you on that?

14:27.400 --> 14:29.280
I'm supposed
to be seeing Margaret that night.

14:29.360 --> 14:34.320
[woman] That's all right.
I promise not to totally exhaust you.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.040
I just thought that
I might pop the question to her then.

14:37.120 --> 14:40.600
-[woman] Which question?
-That question.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.520
You said she had thick ankles
and the face of a Jewish manicurist.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.240
[Tony] Well, [groans] she does.

14:48.320 --> 14:51.120
[woman laughs]

14:51.200 --> 14:53.400
But she's adorable, too.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.680
-And with a quick temper.
-Oh, is that a plus?

14:57.600 --> 14:59.520
It's not unsexy.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.880
It doesn't mean you have to marry her.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.120
I'm afraid I do.

15:07.520 --> 15:08.640
Other reasons.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.680
Don't ask me to explain.

15:29.440 --> 15:34.200
[man on TV]  Most of the species
in Galapagos are unique to the islands.

15:34.280 --> 15:39.760
For instance,
this sea lion, uh, is a subspecies

15:39.840 --> 15:42.440
found only in the Galapagos.

[puts ashtray down]

20:22.360 --> 20:25.000
Will you forgive me
if I don't go down on one knee?

20:26.720 --> 20:27.680
Hmm?

20:28.800 --> 20:32.360
You won't defer to your princess,
even when you propose to her?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.720
It's got nothing to do with deference.

20:36.080 --> 20:38.680
-They're chafed from fucking you.
-[chuckles]

20:44.880 --> 20:46.600
Marry me.

20:57.880 --> 20:59.920
I thought you hated the idea of marriage.

21:00.440 --> 21:02.000
I do.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.080
Then I hated the idea
of losing you even more.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.080
You would have lost me.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.720
You'd have come back.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.800
Never.

21:56.000 --> 21:58.000
Promise me one thing.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.680
Name it.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.960
Not to bore me.

22:09.240 --> 22:10.840
Fine.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.560
Now promise me one thing in return.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.960
Name it.

22:25.760 --> 22:26.920
Not to hurt me.

22:33.280 --> 22:34.280
I promise.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.760
Tony has proposed marriage to me
and I've accepted.

22:43.760 --> 22:45.600
That's marginally better than the "Oh,"

22:45.680 --> 22:48.160
which was your reaction
to Peter Townsend's proposal.

22:49.640 --> 22:53.200
Anyway, I do hope there won't be
any objections or obstacles this time.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.400
No, of course not.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.840
Be good enough to give me
that assurance again,

22:56.920 --> 23:00.560
nice and audibly,
so we're both quite clear.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.640
Margaret.

23:09.480 --> 23:14.360
I promise that I will never do anything
to block any marriage of yours ever again.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.320
Thank you.

23:16.400 --> 23:20.560
So I have your blessing to make
the announcement and start making plans?

23:20.640 --> 23:21.640
-Yes...
-Good.

23:21.720 --> 23:25.840
Then forgive me for not staying longer.
I'd just like to get cracking on this.

23:27.160 --> 23:31.160
Peter wrote to me. He's marrying too.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.800
She's 19.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.800
-Oh, Margaret.
-So my announcement must come first.

24:14.200 --> 24:16.200
[phone rings]

24:21.080 --> 24:22.680
[phone continues ringing]

24:24.360 --> 24:25.760
[man] Birr Castle. Good evening.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.120
It's Tony Armstrong-Jones.
I'd like to speak to my mother.

24:28.880 --> 24:31.080
I'll see if Lady Rosse is available.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.880
Tell her it's important.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.360
Lady Rosse is resting at the moment, sir.

24:52.440 --> 24:55.440
She has asked
that you might call back again tomorrow.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.520
[dial tone humming]

25:10.160 --> 25:11.200
[loud thud]

25:15.920 --> 25:17.320
Shit.

25:21.640 --> 25:23.640
-[Margaret] Tony?
-Coming.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.800
Ah.

25:31.160 --> 25:32.760
-[squeals]
-[groans]

25:47.520 --> 25:48.440
Ma'am.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.320
Do sit down, Michael.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.600
So where shall we do it?
What do you fancy?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.600
People will expect the abbey,

26:08.680 --> 26:11.600
but since there's no danger
of my ever wearing the crown,

26:11.680 --> 26:14.080
we can break with that, if we want.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.360
-And go to Gretna Green?
-[chuckles]

26:18.000 --> 26:19.160
Why not?

26:20.720 --> 26:22.320
Or Las Vegas.

26:23.280 --> 26:25.360
I've been informed by Princess Margaret

26:25.440 --> 26:27.120
that she's received a proposal
of marriage.

26:29.080 --> 26:32.840
She's accepted that proposal and now
wishes to make a public statement.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.880
Would you kindly speak
to Commander Colville

26:34.960 --> 26:39.040
and the rest of the people in
the press office and ask them to help her?

26:40.600 --> 26:41.840
Of course, ma'am.

26:44.960 --> 26:49.200
And it is to be the photographer, ma'am?

26:51.040 --> 26:52.040
Yes.

26:52.600 --> 26:56.960
-Mr. Jones.
-Armstrong-Jones, I believe.

26:59.720 --> 27:02.640
-I see.
-She's quite within her rights, Michael.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.880
And she seems very determined.

27:04.960 --> 27:07.880
And we can ill afford another drama
like Peter Townsend,

27:07.960 --> 27:11.920
so I'm going to support it,
come what may.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.200
Of course, ma'am.

27:16.520 --> 27:18.880
There is one slight problem, though.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.640
Wouldn't it be fun
if we did choose the abbey?

27:24.720 --> 27:28.680
One half full of your friends,
one half full of mine.

27:29.360 --> 27:32.560
New world, old world.

27:33.600 --> 27:37.720
Like an eagle with two heads,
facing in opposite directions.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.680
All right. Let's do the abbey.

27:45.720 --> 27:50.640
And let's make it bigger than my sister's.
Let's eclipse her.

27:51.640 --> 27:54.440
Let's shake this place to its core.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.080
[Margaret]  The decision we've come to

28:01.160 --> 28:06.120
is a little announcement
followed by a big wedding...

28:06.200 --> 28:08.360
at the abbey.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.360
Ta-da!

28:15.360 --> 28:18.680
I brought a copy of the statement which
we'll give to the newspapers tomorrow.

28:24.720 --> 28:26.720
Well, what do you think?

28:27.560 --> 28:29.680
It looks fine, but, uh...

28:30.520 --> 28:32.080
No, don't come with "buts."

28:38.360 --> 28:41.320
-We're going to have to delay it.
-Delay what?

28:42.520 --> 28:46.040
The announcement. Just for a few months.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.920
-Why?
-Because of the baby.

28:50.840 --> 28:52.360
What baby?

28:53.880 --> 28:56.400
Mine. I'm expecting.

28:56.480 --> 28:58.200
Since when?

28:58.280 --> 29:00.800
Fourteen weeks.

29:00.880 --> 29:02.880
Why didn't you tell me that?

29:02.960 --> 29:06.200
I've tried, but your head's been
in the clouds, understandably.

29:06.280 --> 29:09.720
What has expecting
got to do with anything?

29:09.800 --> 29:14.600
-Congratulations, by the way.
-Thank you. It's a protocol issue.

29:14.680 --> 29:17.080
-Oh, pro-- Oh, I understand!
-No, Margaret, you don't.

29:17.160 --> 29:20.760
This is just some scheme cooked up
by all of you to put me off the marriage.

29:20.840 --> 29:22.960
No. It's a tiresome protocol issue.

29:23.040 --> 29:26.360
Until the sovereign's child is born, no
other family announcements can be made.

29:26.440 --> 29:29.400
Don't you see? Until we announce it,
we can't marry, either.

29:29.480 --> 29:32.640
-No, just for six months.
-Another six months?

29:32.720 --> 29:34.160
Margaret.

29:35.280 --> 29:38.320
Most of that time will be taken up
with planning anyway.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.080
Margaret. Margaret.

29:43.160 --> 29:48.320
As indication of my support as Queen,
I intend to throw a party.

29:49.320 --> 29:53.280
For the family. For your friends.
To show our support.

29:54.280 --> 29:56.200
We never did that for Peter.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.520
You never did anything for Peter.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.880
Margaret, you have my word.
It's full steam ahead.

30:03.960 --> 30:08.280
You will marry Tony.
We just can't announce it yet.

30:17.800 --> 30:21.440
Mr. Aneurin Bevan, who if he isn't
returned it'll be a miracle, of course,

30:21.520 --> 30:24.560
-with his enormous majority in...
-Bob.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.760
Bob, I'll just interrupt you one second.
I'm being called for... Sorry.

30:28.840 --> 30:32.640
I've stopped him now, so we'll just
confirm Edinburgh Pentlands.

30:32.720 --> 30:35.320
Bob Mackenzie said
that Labour needed that swing,

30:35.400 --> 30:38.120
two percent or more, to win the election.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.960
At the beginning of the night,
it was all over the place.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.760
One or two the other way
made us think we must hesitate,

30:43.840 --> 30:46.480
but after 30 results it's settled down...

30:46.560 --> 30:49.080
[Tony] So it's most likely
to be an earldom.

30:50.760 --> 30:53.160
What they'll give me
to make me acceptable.

30:53.240 --> 30:55.240
-An earldom?
-Mm.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.720
Not a fucking dukedom.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.320
[chuckling]

31:00.400 --> 31:01.560
Or a marquisate.

31:02.240 --> 31:04.400
But as husband to the Queen's sister,

31:04.480 --> 31:08.800
I'd still rank higher than the man
my mother took as her second husband,

31:08.880 --> 31:11.080
the Irishman, when she left my father.

31:13.200 --> 31:15.520
And I'd rank higher
than the son she gave him,

31:16.520 --> 31:20.000
little Brendan,  le vicomte.

31:21.800 --> 31:27.520
On our trips to Ireland, he, Brendan,
would travel first class in the train

31:27.600 --> 31:30.400
and my stepbrother would travel
in second class,

31:30.480 --> 31:33.440
and I was made to travel third.

31:36.400 --> 31:42.000
The runt son from the unsatisfactory
first marriage with no title.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.880
And a polio-twisted leg.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.040
Oh.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.240
Could you? Would you? Thank you.

31:56.200 --> 31:57.320
Love you.

31:57.400 --> 32:02.680
Conservative Party: 27,055.

32:04.120 --> 32:09.760
And this points to a Conservative majority
of 110 over Labour,

32:09.840 --> 32:13.240
over 100 over all parties
in the next Parliament.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.520
Are you in the mood for some questions?

32:53.960 --> 32:56.040
It depends on the questions.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.280
Does it hurt?

32:59.480 --> 33:03.160
No, it doesn't hurt.

33:04.080 --> 33:05.880
[sighs]

33:05.960 --> 33:08.120
But it is uncomfortable,

33:09.240 --> 33:14.040
especially if the baby's sitting down
in my pelvis or decides to kick me.

33:14.640 --> 33:17.800
-No, you see, now you're not interested.
-I'm very interested.

33:19.960 --> 33:23.880
One does feel cumbersome,
and I'm tired all the time

33:23.960 --> 33:28.000
and I can't do anything
and I can't bend down.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.640
It's rather like that journey
from Aberdeen to Balmoral.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.560
-Don't.
-It just seems to go on forever.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.280
And one's toes are disappearing.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.480
Don't say that.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.560
-I like your toes.
-My toes are hideous.

33:42.640 --> 33:45.520
Don't be silly.
They're the second-best thing about you.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.760
That's a horrible compliment.

33:47.840 --> 33:50.040
There's no such thing
as a bad compliment.

33:50.440 --> 33:54.080
That's true. Beggars can't be choosers.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.320
What's the best thing?

34:01.400 --> 34:02.920
[inhales]

34:03.000 --> 34:05.000
What's the best thing?

34:07.400 --> 34:08.520
Two things, really.

34:08.600 --> 34:10.239
-Oh!
-[both laugh]

34:12.520 --> 34:15.400
Reason alone to have children, I'd say.
Enormous.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.000
-Yes, all right.
-You milkmaid.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.400
No. No, no. Barmaid.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.280
-Oh.
-Go on, indulge me.

34:25.560 --> 34:27.159
Pour me a pint.

34:28.199 --> 34:30.199
Filthily. Go on.

34:30.960 --> 34:33.120
-I haven't the faintest idea.
-Go on.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.840
Like this.

34:41.239 --> 34:44.000
Look me in the eyes while you're doing it.

34:44.080 --> 34:45.679
Go on.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.600
[laughs]

34:53.639 --> 34:54.639
[sighs]

34:54.719 --> 34:56.040
[indistinct chatter]

34:56.120 --> 34:57.120
[car door closes]

35:01.840 --> 35:04.720
[sound of faint music]

35:08.200 --> 35:09.360
[handbrake]

35:10.800 --> 35:12.600
[crowd chattering]

35:15.600 --> 35:16.440
[car door closes]

35:20.200 --> 35:22.600
-[music playing]
-[chattering]

35:31.280 --> 35:33.160
-[indistinct chatter]
-[laughter]

35:35.920 --> 35:39.480
[Lady Rosse] I'd adore you to come to Birr
in March. That's when we have the hunt.

35:39.560 --> 35:42.280
-[Queen Mother] Really?
-Yes, and if you do...

35:42.360 --> 35:43.200
[laughs]

35:43.280 --> 35:46.880
-[Margaret] This way.
-[Tony] Please, someone interesting.

35:47.920 --> 35:52.480
[Margaret] Darling, this is John Beaufort.
These are great friends of ours.

35:56.560 --> 35:59.120
-[laughter]
-The little finger. The little finger.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.000
[indistinct chatter]

36:08.280 --> 36:10.280
[laughter]

36:15.960 --> 36:17.960
[Margaret] Whiskey, please, darling.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.520
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

36:31.520 --> 36:33.720
Of course, in some ways, you have.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.840
Hideous, redundant relics and specters,
all of them.

36:36.920 --> 36:37.920
[Mrs. Fry laughs]

36:38.680 --> 36:40.720
-No, it's not that.
-What?

36:40.800 --> 36:43.120
-Two whiskeys, please.
-[man] Certainly, sir.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.760
I didn't want to tell you tonight.

36:48.640 --> 36:49.640
What?

36:51.760 --> 36:53.760
Tony, I'm pregnant.

36:57.000 --> 36:58.040
Me?

36:59.560 --> 37:01.720
-You can't be sure.
-I'm 99 percent.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.480
Well, that still leaves one percent.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.280
-Have you told Jeremy?
-Not yet. I daren't.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.320
-[Lady Rosse] Well, he did Knollys House.
-Yes, yes.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.960
[Lady Rosse] And he adores it.
He's got it in his living room.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.760
-[party music]
-[guests chatter and laugh]

37:42.280 --> 37:44.160
[Philip] If any further evidence
were needed

37:44.240 --> 37:47.400
to prove that we are a changed country,
then this is it.

37:49.040 --> 37:50.800
It's all changed so quickly.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.840
-Within a generation.
-Yes.

37:55.920 --> 37:58.760
Just 15 minutes ago, the British
government and establishment

37:58.840 --> 38:00.680
were up in arms
about my joining this family.

38:00.760 --> 38:03.680
-I remember.
-I was a royal prince from a royal house.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.880
My great-great-grandmother
was Queen Victoria.

38:05.960 --> 38:08.520
My father was a prince,
my grandfather was a king,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.160
and everyone was mortified
at how inappropriate I was

38:11.240 --> 38:12.640
and how low you were stooping.

38:12.720 --> 38:14.480
-I know.
-I mean, this fella's mother...

38:14.560 --> 38:16.840
-[whispers] Stop it!
-...is a ghastly social climber.

38:16.920 --> 38:20.200
His father's a common-or-garden
contract lawyer who buggered off

38:20.280 --> 38:21.520
with an airline stewardess

38:21.600 --> 38:24.720
and everyone's throwing their hats
in the air, declaring it's a victory.

38:25.280 --> 38:26.640
Not yet.

38:28.360 --> 38:29.400
Pathetic.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.960
[Queen Mother] Come on, Margaret.
Now, follow me.

38:35.040 --> 38:37.520
-Come on, everybody. Do join in.
-[Margaret] Please come on.

38:38.160 --> 38:39.680
[laughter]

38:42.120 --> 38:43.680
-Ma'am.
-[Queen Mother] Here we go.

38:43.760 --> 38:45.920
-Michael.
-[Queen Mother] I'll lead the way.

38:46.000 --> 38:50.560
If there was anything that one ought
to know about Mr. Armstrong-Jones

38:50.640 --> 38:53.320
before he becomes part of this family,

38:53.400 --> 38:56.160
it might be better to know
sooner rather than later.

38:57.200 --> 39:01.120
What is it that Your Majesty
would like to know?

39:04.040 --> 39:05.080
[Tony] Coming through!

39:06.360 --> 39:08.520
-[Michael] Ma'am.
-[Tony] Coming through.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.160
[Tony] Mind yourselves.

39:13.520 --> 39:14.680
-Whoa!
-[laughter]

39:15.800 --> 39:17.360
[laughter gets louder]

39:18.640 --> 39:20.200
[Queen Mother laughs] Lilibet.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.280
-[Tommy] Michael.
-[Michael] Morning, Tommy.

39:46.360 --> 39:49.720
[Tommy] I hope Your Majesty
understands the context

39:49.800 --> 39:53.320
in which this discreet
reconnaissance work was done

39:53.400 --> 39:55.480
and that it in no way represents

39:55.560 --> 40:00.880
a prurient, moralistic
or censorious position.

40:01.640 --> 40:04.720
Mr. Armstrong-Jones is perfectly entitled
in his private life

40:04.800 --> 40:08.320
to make those choices he wishes,
indeed, to live as he wishes.

40:08.800 --> 40:09.960
[Michael clears throat]

40:10.560 --> 40:14.600
However, as with a great many artists,

40:14.680 --> 40:19.440
the, uh, conventional approach to life
doesn't appear to fit.

40:20.200 --> 40:24.120
It seems that what makes his work notable

40:24.200 --> 40:27.720
is his willingness, his appetite,

40:27.800 --> 40:30.440
to break barriers and conventions,

40:30.520 --> 40:36.480
as he pushes his medium,
photography, I believe, to its boundaries,

40:36.560 --> 40:40.040
and, um, [clears throat] as in art,

40:40.120 --> 40:42.800
so, it would appear, in life.

40:45.720 --> 40:46.720
I see.

40:47.120 --> 40:48.120
[sighs]

40:50.160 --> 40:56.160
The narrow path,
the straight, Christian path,

40:57.240 --> 40:58.840
is not to his taste.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.880
-To the best of our knowledge...
-[unlocks briefcase]

41:08.960 --> 41:11.320
...he is currently conducting

41:12.120 --> 41:16.400
no fewer than three other
intimate relationships.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.440
What?

41:21.440 --> 41:22.800
With whom?

41:24.120 --> 41:28.280
With a Miss Jacqui Chan,

41:28.360 --> 41:31.040
an Oriental dancer and singer.

41:32.320 --> 41:36.000
With Gina Ward, an actress.

41:36.080 --> 41:41.680
And with a Miss Robin Banks,
his former assistant.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.880
These, we should add...

41:51.400 --> 41:54.240
Are just the natural ones.

41:56.320 --> 41:57.480
What?

41:58.120 --> 42:01.760
There is good reason
to suspect that Mr. Armstrong-Jones

42:01.840 --> 42:04.800
has a taste for members of his own sex

42:04.880 --> 42:09.040
and that his close friendship
with his proposed best man,

42:09.120 --> 42:11.520
-Mr. Jeremy Fry, is...
-Yes.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.000
-...in fact--
-All right, Tommy.

42:17.640 --> 42:20.400
Not to mention his wife.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.560
-Please.
-Camilla.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.080
Formerly Grinling.

42:26.160 --> 42:30.200
An erstwhile girlfriend
of Armstrong-Jones.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.960
Who is now expecting, herself.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.120
Do you have a photograph of her?

42:42.200 --> 42:43.200
We do.

42:46.200 --> 42:48.600
[Tommy] Thank you, Michael. [exhales]

43:12.160 --> 43:13.160
[Elizabeth gasps]

43:41.920 --> 43:43.080
[zip opens]

43:50.200 --> 43:52.480
[doctor] If you agree, gentlemen,
it's customary

43:52.560 --> 43:54.520
to inform the Home Secretary
at this point.

44:02.960 --> 44:04.160
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[thud]

44:04.240 --> 44:06.680
-Christ, Jim.
-[Jim] All right, all right, all right.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.960
-OK?
-Right.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.400
[Jim groans]

44:22.680 --> 44:24.640
[Jim groans]

44:25.680 --> 44:28.560
-Some twilight sleep, ma'am.
-[Elizabeth whispers] Thank you.

44:31.640 --> 44:32.960
[Elizabeth inhales sharply]

44:33.040 --> 44:38.160
I'm happy to tell you, delivery of
the Queen's child is expected imminently.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.080
Oh, well. Good gracious.

44:40.800 --> 44:45.160
Well, um, perhaps a moment's prayer
on behalf of the government?

44:48.120 --> 44:51.080
[Macmillan] O Lord, our heavenly Father,
high and mighty,

44:51.160 --> 44:53.120
king of kings, lord of lords...

44:53.200 --> 44:54.280
[doctor] There we are.

44:54.360 --> 44:56.640
...the only ruler of princes,

44:57.520 --> 45:01.640
who dost, from Thy throne,
behold all the dwellers upon Earth.

45:02.920 --> 45:06.320
Most heartily, we beseech Thee,
with thy favor,

45:06.400 --> 45:10.880
to behold our most gracious
Sovereign Lady, Queen Elizabeth,

45:11.840 --> 45:16.000
and so replenish her
with the grace of thy Holy Spirit,

45:16.080 --> 45:18.440
that she may always incline

45:18.520 --> 45:21.960
-to Thy will and walk in Thy way...
-[breathes heavily]

45:22.040 --> 45:25.520
Endue her plenteously
with heavenly gifts.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.480
[Jim groans]

45:31.120 --> 45:32.480
Shit.

45:32.560 --> 45:36.880
[Macmillan]  Grant her,
in health and wealth, long to live.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.880
Strengthen her, that she may vanquish
and overcome all her enemies

45:42.960 --> 45:45.360
and, finally, after this life...

45:45.440 --> 45:47.120
-[groans]
-Ah, shit!

45:47.760 --> 45:51.880
...she may attain
everlasting joy and felicity

45:51.960 --> 45:54.880
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

45:54.960 --> 45:56.960
-Amen.
-[ministers]  Amen.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.720
[baby gurgles]

46:16.960 --> 46:22.440
-[nurse] Good baby. What a good baby.
-[baby gurgles]

46:22.520 --> 46:25.560
[man on radio]  This is London.
Here is the news.

46:26.480 --> 46:29.240
[radio pips]

46:30.680 --> 46:33.400
[man on radio]  The new prince
will be second in line to the throne

46:33.480 --> 46:36.480
and was born weighing
seven pounds and three ounces.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.040
A name is expected
to be announced soon.

46:39.120 --> 46:43.440
Celebrations today include a 41-gun
salute by the Royal Horse Artillery

46:43.520 --> 46:47.240
and a 21-gun salute by the Royal Navy.

46:47.320 --> 46:50.160
[woman on radio]  This is the British
Broadcasting Corporation...

46:50.240 --> 46:52.320
[airplanes approach]

46:59.520 --> 47:01.320
[crowd clamoring]

47:01.400 --> 47:02.640
[horn honks]

47:03.800 --> 47:05.480
[faint sound of crowd chattering]

47:05.560 --> 47:07.400
[man] You have a new nephew,
Your Highness.

47:07.480 --> 47:09.200
[woman] Congratulations.

47:12.840 --> 47:15.720
[baby cries]

47:15.800 --> 47:18.200
-[Elizabeth] Hello.
-[Margaret] Hello.

47:19.720 --> 47:21.960
-Look. He's beautiful.
-[baby coos]

47:22.040 --> 47:24.840
-Thank you.
-Have you thought of a name?

47:26.040 --> 47:30.560
Well, we briefly considered George,

47:30.640 --> 47:33.600
but there's been too many of those,
and anyway, no one could live up to Papa.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.000
-[Margaret] No.
-[baby cries]

47:35.080 --> 47:37.520
And then we thought of Louis,
but that was a bit too...

47:37.600 --> 47:39.200
-[Margaret scoffs] Foreign.
-Mm.

47:40.040 --> 47:44.360
-So, we've decided upon Andrew.
-Oh...

47:44.440 --> 47:45.560
After Philip's father.

47:46.280 --> 47:47.840
Yes, the bankrupt philanderer.

47:49.080 --> 47:50.080
Philip's father.

47:57.200 --> 48:02.280
So, now the baby's here and healthy
and all is well, everybody's thrilled,

48:02.360 --> 48:04.720
I would just like your blessing
for me and Tony to...

48:04.800 --> 48:06.120
[inhales]

48:07.040 --> 48:10.560
-Yes, you know what I'm about to say.
-Announce your engagement?

48:10.640 --> 48:11.720
Yes.

48:14.280 --> 48:15.440
Very well.

48:16.920 --> 48:18.040
Thank you.

48:20.200 --> 48:21.040
[chuckles]

48:24.200 --> 48:28.720
But before you announce it
and rush up the aisle...

48:35.160 --> 48:37.160
are you sure that Tony's the right man?

48:44.320 --> 48:46.520
-I can't believe you're doing this.
-Margaret.

48:47.520 --> 48:50.280
In the first flush of a romantic love,
we're all blind.

48:51.240 --> 48:53.280
We see only what we want to see.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.120
-You hardly know him.
-And you know him even less.

49:00.200 --> 49:02.680
I'm just concerned
that in a rush to heal wounds...

49:02.760 --> 49:04.240
Wounds inflicted by you.

49:04.320 --> 49:08.880
...you end up committing yourself
to something, someone,

49:08.960 --> 49:10.760
that isn't quite right.

49:13.800 --> 49:16.200
You told me yourself
you only embarked on this engagement

49:16.280 --> 49:19.440
after you heard from Peter
that he intended to marry someone else.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.400
I just want to make sure
that this isn't some kind of revenge.

49:24.480 --> 49:28.320
Tony is no revenge. Tony is a free choice.

49:29.320 --> 49:32.360
Tony has given me reason
to hope and dream.

49:32.440 --> 49:36.680
-He makes me feel things no one ever has.
-[sighs]

49:36.760 --> 49:37.760
[laughs]

49:38.600 --> 49:41.040
Things I didn't imagine possible.

49:42.840 --> 49:44.400
I don't doubt that.

49:47.960 --> 49:50.360
But he's also a very complicated man.

49:53.600 --> 49:57.880
With a complicated past
and, who knows,

49:59.680 --> 50:01.520
a complicated present.

50:02.840 --> 50:04.320
What is that supposed to mean?

50:11.400 --> 50:13.200
Or is there something you know?

50:14.560 --> 50:16.400
Because if there is, tell me now.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.720
Tell me now.

50:28.240 --> 50:31.240
I'm merely asking if he's the right man
for a lifelong commitment.

50:33.760 --> 50:36.720
Is he really cut out for marriage
with all its ups and downs?

50:36.800 --> 50:40.280
I will marry Tony
if it is the last thing I do.

50:41.280 --> 50:45.120
At the Chelsea Registry Office,
with a local drunk as witness, if need be.

50:46.760 --> 50:49.920
Because Tony makes sense of me,
defines me.

50:51.080 --> 50:56.080
At long last, I know who I am
and what I represent.

50:57.680 --> 50:59.520
And what is that?

51:01.840 --> 51:04.840
A woman in my own right.

51:06.440 --> 51:08.440
A woman for the modern age.

51:09.280 --> 51:12.160
And, above all, a woman who is free.

51:13.200 --> 51:16.680
Free to live, to love,

51:17.880 --> 51:20.080
and free to break away.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.880
But you're not breaking away.

51:23.760 --> 51:28.080
Because you won't give up your title,
your rank, your privileges,

51:28.160 --> 51:29.760
for one simple reason.

51:30.600 --> 51:32.400
You enjoy it all too much.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.200
The palaces, the privileges,
the deference.

51:35.280 --> 51:37.920
It's always meant more to you
than it did to me.

51:41.640 --> 51:44.320
-[baby cries]
-Whereas all I wanted to do was...

51:45.760 --> 51:47.080
give it all up...

51:48.520 --> 51:51.480
disappear and become invisible.

51:55.520 --> 51:58.400
Well, in that case, your achievement's
all the more remarkable.

52:01.840 --> 52:06.840
As you've managed to disappear and
become invisible, while wearing the crown.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.720
-Margaret...
-I'll see you in the abbey.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
[man on TV]  When the announcement
of the betrothal

52:39.080 --> 52:40.400
was made from Clarence House,

52:40.480 --> 52:43.080
the reaction everywhere
was not only one of surprise

52:43.160 --> 52:45.080
but also of the greatest pleasure.

52:51.760 --> 52:54.480
Strange to be getting up
in a London street,

52:54.560 --> 52:57.800
but you must have your hair looking
its best on a great day like this.

53:05.080 --> 53:06.160
[door opens]

53:31.280 --> 53:33.120
[man on TV]
Before the great news was given,

53:33.200 --> 53:36.880
the princess's fiancé was quite unknown
to the people of Britain.

53:36.960 --> 53:40.880
[man on radio]  Now everyone knows he's
29, the same age as Princess Margaret.

53:40.960 --> 53:43.080
He was educated
at Eton and at Cambridge,

53:43.160 --> 53:45.880
where he coxed the winning crew in 1950,

53:45.960 --> 53:48.560
and he's unconventional, talented
and very popular--

53:48.640 --> 53:49.800
[switches radio off]

53:53.800 --> 53:56.280
[man on TV]  They spent some time
walking through the grounds

53:56.360 --> 53:59.280
while the cameras continued
to make this delightful record.

54:02.640 --> 54:04.440
[crowd cheering]

54:15.800 --> 54:18.680
[music box playing]

54:29.920 --> 54:32.560
[music box continues playing]

54:34.760 --> 54:35.600
[music stops]

54:41.400 --> 54:43.800
[crowd cheers]

55:05.800 --> 55:06.960
[sighs]

55:22.720 --> 55:25.000
[bells ring in the distance]

55:43.200 --> 55:45.120
Your father would have been proud.

56:10.440 --> 56:12.240
[crowd on TV cheers]

56:26.880 --> 56:28.840
[crowd cheering]

56:40.920 --> 56:42.560
Well, not bad, you'd have to say.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.000
What?

56:45.080 --> 56:47.720
For the son
that always brought you shame.

56:48.600 --> 56:52.200
The son that you rejected.
The son that was never good enough.

56:58.880 --> 57:01.760
I suppose I always thought
that eventually you'd find it in you

57:01.840 --> 57:03.520
to admit that you're proud of me.

57:06.640 --> 57:08.560
Perhaps even that you love me.

57:10.360 --> 57:13.120
Darling, I do hope
you haven't done all this for me.

57:20.040 --> 57:26.320
[man]  Antony Charles Robert, wilt
thou have this woman to thy wedded wife,

57:26.400 --> 57:29.240
to live together after God's ordinance

57:29.320 --> 57:32.440
in the holy estate of matrimony?

57:32.520 --> 57:38.160
Wilt thou love her, comfort her,
honor and keep her,

57:38.240 --> 57:41.120
in sickness and in health,

57:41.200 --> 57:46.040
and, forsaking all other,
keep thee only unto her,

57:46.120 --> 57:48.400
as long as ye both shall live?

57:48.480 --> 57:50.000
[Tony]  I will.

57:51.240 --> 57:53.320
[crowd continues cheering]

57:56.040 --> 57:57.280
[cameras click]

57:57.360 --> 58:02.440
[man]  Margaret Rose, wilt thou
have this man to thy wedded husband,

58:02.520 --> 58:07.920
to live together after God's ordinance
in the holy estate of matrimony?

58:08.000 --> 58:12.920
Wilt thou obey him and serve him,
love, honor and keep him,

58:13.000 --> 58:15.400
in sickness and in health,

58:15.480 --> 58:17.720
-and, forsaking all other...
-[church bells ring]

58:17.800 --> 58:19.880
...keep thee only unto him,

58:19.960 --> 58:22.600
so long as ye both shall live?

58:22.680 --> 58:23.960
[Margaret]  I will.
