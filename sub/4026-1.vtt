13:04.909 --> 13:05.951
Let go!

13:06.035 --> 13:08.162
You know I'm stronger
than you, Greg Heffley.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.956
Don't make me
beat you up again!

13:11.040 --> 13:12.207
Let's get
something straight.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.710
I was sick that day and
I had something in my eye.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.545
[MR. DRAYBICK]: Well!

13:17.881 --> 13:20.757
I've never had students so
eager to start the school year.

13:20.842 --> 13:21.967
What's going on?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.427
This is my seat!
This is my seat!

13:23.636 --> 13:27.514
(LAUGHS) Okay, let's start
again. What are your names?

13:28.475 --> 13:32.227
Patty Farrell,
two R's, two L's.

13:35.690 --> 13:39.568
Greg Heffley.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.072
Would you be related
to Rodrick Heffley?

13:47.410 --> 13:48.410
(EXHALES)

14:04.594 --> 14:07.554
I've got my eye
on you, Heffley.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.019
[GREG]:
There's no way to escape.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.564
(RODRICK LAUGHS EVILLY)

14:17.649 --> 14:21.777
It's unbelievable! Even at school,
Rodrick is ruining my life.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.070
Shh!

14:23.780 --> 14:24.780
(WHISPERS)
He might hear you.

14:25.823 --> 14:27.824
Nah. Watch.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.576
(BANGING LOUDLY)

14:30.453 --> 14:31.662
Holy cow!

14:31.955 --> 14:33.956
He once slept through
an entire day.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.500
Do you have an amazing talent
that you'd like to share?

14:37.460 --> 14:41.380
Today, Plainview City Council
announced a brand-new local contest:

14:41.464 --> 14:43.048
Plainview's Most Talented.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.133
Hey! Greg!
Maybe we should...

14:45.218 --> 14:46.593
Can it,
Chunky Cheese!

14:46.678 --> 14:50.097
Westmore is absolutely packed
to the roof with talent.

14:50.181 --> 14:52.683
The top prize is 1,000 dollars
and of course,

14:52.767 --> 14:54.726
the admiration of your
friends and neighbors.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.230
This is huge. I gotta call
the band. We gotta practice.

14:58.314 --> 14:59.565
This is gonna be
our big break!

14:59.649 --> 15:00.816
Uh-uh-uh.
Wait a second.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.235
Aren't you forgetting something? What?

15:03.361 --> 15:05.070
I showered yesterday.
Smell.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.822
Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.825
We agreed that you'd give
a drum lesson to Greg.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.618
You were serious?

15:11.703 --> 15:12.744
[SUSAN]: Who knows?

15:13.121 --> 15:14.663
Maybe you guys
will really like it

15:14.747 --> 15:16.248
and we can form a family band.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.333

15:21.462 --> 15:23.797
Come on get happy

15:25.466 --> 15:29.636
A whole lotta lovin'

We'll make you happy

15:31.639 --> 15:33.515
(ROCK SONG PLAYING)

15:38.021 --> 15:40.022
[GREG]: Rodrick says
he's a professional musician,

15:40.106 --> 15:42.733
but as far as I know
the only money he's made,

15:42.817 --> 15:45.736
is when Dad gave him five
bucks once to stop playing.

15:45.903 --> 15:47.988
When do we get to
play the real drums?

15:48.364 --> 15:50.032
Like I'd ever
let you touch them!

15:50.450 --> 15:53.076
Watch and learn,
earthworm!

15:53.870 --> 15:57.539
Hey, I was thinking we
should enter the talent show.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.292
I could do my magic act and
you could be my assistant.

16:00.376 --> 16:01.793
Assistant? No way.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.296
Doing magic tricks
is bad enough.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.590
Assisting the guy
doing the tricks?

16:06.883 --> 16:09.176
I'd never make it
to eighth grade.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.602
(BEEPS)

16:21.648 --> 16:22.939
What?

16:23.024 --> 16:24.399
Hey, a cookie.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.109
Manny,
what have you done?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.819
I'm only three.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.072
What's going on?
What did you do to him?

16:30.156 --> 16:32.074
Nothing!
He ruined my video game.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.494
Oh! He didn't do anything
on purpose. Did you, honey?

16:35.578 --> 16:38.705
No, I didn't. No, he
didn't. He's only three.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.749
[MANNY]: I'm only three!

16:41.584 --> 16:43.710
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
You want another cookie?

16:43.795 --> 16:45.128
[GREG]: It's so unfair.

16:45.213 --> 16:47.381
I have Rodrick making my
life a misery on one side,

16:47.465 --> 16:49.007
and Manny attacking me
from the other.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.803
And I'm the only one who seems
to get blamed for anything.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.264
I wonder what it'd be like to have
a family that actually loves me.

16:56.474 --> 16:57.599
Little boy!

16:58.142 --> 17:01.561
We're a very rich couple with no
children and so much love to share.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.271
Won't you come be
part of our family?

17:04.773 --> 17:08.276
Finally! Someone I can
leave my billions to.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.611
(SIGHS)

17:11.030 --> 17:13.240
India? Why would
you go there?

17:13.407 --> 17:17.493
India is fascinating. It's
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.538
My father has business
to take care of,

17:19.622 --> 17:21.498
so he's taking
the whole family.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.165
Can you bring me
back a cobra?

17:23.251 --> 17:25.669
I want to
teach it to dance!

17:30.550 --> 17:33.719

What are you guys doing over there?

Wow. Holly Hills is better than
Bryce. And he's an all-star!

18:00.288 --> 18:02.080
Well, I'm sure
your soccer skills

18:02.165 --> 18:03.999

impression on her.

Go strike while
the iron is hot.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.043
You'll see.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.962
When you come back
from India,

18:09.464 --> 18:10.881
she'll be
hanging out with me.

18:12.842 --> 18:14.801
[CHIRAG]: I would love for that
to be true, Gregory.

18:15.011 --> 18:17.721
It would provide hope
for smaller boys everywhere,

18:17.805 --> 18:21.933
but girls like that just don't
hang out with guys like us.

18:26.355 --> 18:30.525
So, listen, you don't have to worry
about being in my magic show anymore,

18:30.735 --> 18:33.737
'cause I got Scotty from my
karate class to be my assistant.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.114
Scotty?
Isn't he like eight?

18:36.491 --> 18:38.533
He'll be eight.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.888
I needed the room
for my new equipment.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.308
How'd you have
the money for that?

19:03.434 --> 19:05.560
You know, Mom Bucks.

19:06.938 --> 19:09.731

Yeah. Definitely.

He made it for you because
he wanted to say he was sorry

20:53.836 --> 20:57.130

Down, down, down!
All right, let's go.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.787
I'd rather
you hadn't than had

38:09.871 --> 38:12.581
If you hadn't
I wouldn't be mad

38:12.666 --> 38:15.459
At what I'd been handed
Despite it I've landed

38:15.543 --> 38:17.920
On both feet so
don't worry, Dad

38:18.004 --> 38:19.296
It looks good.

38:19.381 --> 38:21.090
Too good.

paint over it.

I don't know
how to make paint!

38:38.191 --> 38:39.316
I got it!

38:39.401 --> 38:41.235
See? It's a good thing
I locked you down here.

38:41.319 --> 38:42.319
Now let's go!

38:45.156 --> 38:46.281

doesn't have a lock on it.

39:12.934 --> 39:15.310

it and this doesn't. We're dead.

Hi.
Hey, Mom, Dad.

39:25.947 --> 39:28.490
Hey, how's Manny? Is he
feeling better? Poor little guy.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.368
Yeah. He's doing okay.

The house looks pretty good.

a real mess.

39:41.379 --> 39:42.379

39:44.382 --> 39:45.716
Who came over
this weekend?

39:45.800 --> 39:48.385
(LAUGHING)
What? Nobody.

39:48.845 --> 39:51.597
You said nobody, Dad.
No means no, right?

39:51.681 --> 39:54.141
Yeah, yeah. Good boy.

40:00.815 --> 40:01.857
So,

40:03.860 --> 40:06.153
you guys just hung out?

40:06.321 --> 40:07.905
Had a good time
together, huh?

40:07.989 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, actually.

40:09.991 --> 40:11.950
You know, I never thought I'd admit this,

40:12.035 --> 40:13.994
but we had a pretty
good time together.

40:15.205 --> 40:16.371
Really?

40:16.456 --> 40:18.665
Yeah. Surprised me, too.

40:18.792 --> 40:22.795
So you just worked it
all out by yourselves?

40:22.879 --> 40:26.256
Yeah, I guess. I don't know. Mom,
don't make a big deal about it.

40:26.424 --> 40:27.633
Please, just...
Okay. Okay.

40:27.717 --> 40:30.177
But nothing...
Nothing makes me happier

40:30.261 --> 40:31.762
than to see you two
being friends.

40:31.846 --> 40:32.971
Right, Frank?

40:33.056 --> 40:34.181
Hmm? Yeah.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.059
Yeah.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.854
Okay, let's go upstairs.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.274

40:52.283 --> 40:54.451
You guys got something
you want to tell me?

40:55.662 --> 40:56.703
No.

40:57.372 --> 41:02.501
What was General Grant
doing on the thermostat?

41:03.670 --> 41:04.962
I have no idea.

41:05.046 --> 41:06.380
No idea.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.382
No idea, huh?

41:10.885 --> 41:15.389
Don't... These... These
are off limits! No touch!

41:15.515 --> 41:19.476
They are not toys.
They're figurines!

41:20.728 --> 41:21.812
I can't...

41:24.065 --> 41:26.024
(WHISPERING) We have to keep
them away from the bathroom.

41:26.109 --> 41:27.568

Listen to me.

41:29.988 --> 41:33.157
No matter what they ask you,
no matter how hard they push,

41:33.241 --> 41:35.200
deny, deny, deny.

41:35.451 --> 41:40.080
Even if they figure it out,
never ever admit to anything.

41:40.165 --> 41:43.542
Deny, deny, deny.
Got it?

41:44.127 --> 41:47.504
Got it.
Deny, deny, deny.

41:48.423 --> 41:51.425
It sounds to me like,
"Lie, lie, lie. "

41:51.718 --> 41:54.136
I kind of wish
you hadn't told me.

41:55.471 --> 41:58.974
Don't you understand? Rodrick
isn't beating me up anymore.

41:59.058 --> 42:02.227
But how are they not going to
notice that the lock's gone?

42:02.353 --> 42:04.271
Please.
They're like 40.

42:04.814 --> 42:06.982
They can barely
remember our names.

42:12.155 --> 42:14.781
Hi, Greg! I've returned from
halfway around the world.

42:16.159 --> 42:19.620
And I see that you're even
further than that from Holly Hills.

42:19.704 --> 42:22.915
I guess your unappealing older
brother was right about you.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.541
You have no game.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.460
[GREG]: You know what?

42:26.544 --> 42:30.088
I liked Chirag a whole lot
better when he was in India.

42:30.173 --> 42:32.382
Man, I sure do miss Chirag.

42:32.467 --> 42:33.759
I wonder when
he's coming back.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.638
It's almost like I can
feel his presence.

42:37.722 --> 42:40.641
What are you talking about? Here I am!

hear something?

42:44.854 --> 42:46.021
No. Nothing.

42:46.356 --> 42:49.983
Well, better get to class. Chirag
would've wanted it that way.

me physically, Greg Heffley,

but mentally,
I am the more muscular!

Hey, Rowley.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.088
Hey.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.426
Does he know
about the D-O-R-E?

43:17.512 --> 43:18.512
Huh?

43:18.846 --> 43:19.846

43:21.015 --> 43:24.476
Yeah. Don't worry. I already
told him, deny, deny, deny.

a lock on this door?

losing my marbles.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.549
Okay, everybody,
dinnertime!

43:56.217 --> 43:58.302
Actually, Mom,
I have to skip dinner.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.137
Why?

44:00.221 --> 44:02.472
I've got the most important
meeting of my life tonight.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.308
Did you say you have a meeting? Yeah.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.519
Like, for like a job?
Yeah. Kind of.

44:07.729 --> 44:10.230
I'm meeting with the best
guitarist in Plainview.

44:10.440 --> 44:13.150
Now he's in between bands, and if
I can get him into LÃ¶ded Diper,

44:13.234 --> 44:15.360
then winning the talent show is a lock.

44:15.486 --> 44:18.613
I mean, you'd like him, Dad. He's
a real professional, like you.

44:18.865 --> 44:20.115
Mmm-hmm.
Be supportive.

44:20.241 --> 44:21.283

44:21.367 --> 44:23.327
That's him.
I'll get that!

Oh, man,
I barely made it here.

so many numbers!

44:30.168 --> 44:32.002
All right, Bill, we should... Whoa!

44:33.755 --> 44:36.048
Do I smell pot roast?

44:44.599 --> 44:45.932
Oh! Mmm.

44:47.769 --> 44:50.354
[GREG]: Bill got voted
"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star"...

44:50.438 --> 44:51.563
when he was
in high school.

44:52.940 --> 44:54.024
[BOY]: You suck!

44:55.610 --> 44:57.277
That hasn't
really worked out.

44:57.487 --> 44:58.612
We should be going...

44:58.696 --> 44:59.780
Sit.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.117
So, Bill,

45:05.453 --> 45:08.038
Rodrick tells me that you're
a professional musician.

45:08.122 --> 45:11.625
So that means that you earn
enough to make a living?

45:11.709 --> 45:13.960
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

45:14.629 --> 45:18.090
Well, enough if you live in
your parents' basement. (LAUGHS)

45:18.633 --> 45:20.717
My parents are
really supportive.

45:20.802 --> 45:23.762

boys!

Hey! That's what
Joshie says!

45:25.640 --> 45:26.765
Shh!

45:26.849 --> 45:27.849
So...

45:28.893 --> 45:31.061
It doesn't sound like
a cakewalk, right? No.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.312
Why don't you
tell Rodrick?

45:32.397 --> 45:35.399
Give him a picture of just how
challenging it can really be.

45:35.483 --> 45:37.484
No, it's really hard.

45:37.860 --> 45:40.862
First of all, there's no
home-cooked meals like this.

45:40.947 --> 45:43.198
What? Really?

45:43.282 --> 45:47.536
Yeah, yeah! No, on the road, it's all

45:47.620 --> 45:51.456
burgers and fries
and pizza.

45:51.541 --> 45:54.668
Then you got to deal with the
fans, especially the girls.

45:55.795 --> 45:59.464
No, it's definitely
not for everyone.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.466
But...

46:02.510 --> 46:08.348
If you like rocking deep into the
night and partying hard all day

46:08.975 --> 46:11.935
then it might be the life for
you. It's definitely for me.

46:12.019 --> 46:13.562
[ROWLEY]:
It does sound fun.

46:13.688 --> 46:16.523
But what if you don't play
a musical instrument?

46:17.525 --> 46:19.734
Löded Diper
always needs roadies.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.362
So... you're joining the band?

46:22.447 --> 46:23.947
Yeah, brother!

46:24.031 --> 46:26.032
I'm in. Let's rock!

46:43.426 --> 46:45.218

Four? We only got
four lousy hits?

about the party. I never lie.

a lie hurts everyone.

he'll ruin it!

He just wanted to come in and
say hi to Rowley. All right?

47:08.910 --> 47:11.328
And Rowley's mother brought
over some healthy snacks

47:11.412 --> 47:14.289

we watch The Foot?

My knee bone.

50:25.231 --> 50:26.523
What?

50:35.032 --> 50:36.616
Mommy, look.

50:36.701 --> 50:40.328
Mommy is looking. Mommy's
looked a thousand times!

50:40.955 --> 50:44.290
Mommy just needs to go to the
potty for one minute, okay?

50:45.167 --> 50:47.127
No! No!

50:49.880 --> 50:53.466
[SUSAN]: What the heck?
Where's the lock?

50:54.343 --> 50:55.468
Wait.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.317
[SUSAN]: Rodrick, could you
come here, please?

51:11.777 --> 51:13.945
What happened
to the lock?

51:14.780 --> 51:15.905
I don't know
what you're talking about.

51:15.990 --> 51:17.991
There was a lock
on this door.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.951
Um...
(LAUGHS)

51:20.035 --> 51:21.661
I don't think so.

51:21.746 --> 51:24.330
Rodrick, I've lived in
this house for 10 years.

51:24.415 --> 51:26.249
I've locked that door
10,000 times

51:26.333 --> 51:30.128
because sometimes it's my only
moment of privacy of the day.

51:30.212 --> 51:31.254
I know there was
a lock on that door.

51:31.380 --> 51:32.422
There wasn't.
Trust me.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.674
Greg has walked in
on me a million times.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.177
And if there was a lock,
I would use it.

51:38.262 --> 51:40.847
In fact, maybe
you should put one on.

51:42.099 --> 51:43.600
So that's your story.

51:43.684 --> 51:46.811
There was never a lock and you
have no idea what I'm talking about.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.606
Yes.

51:50.858 --> 51:54.110
Fine. I'll just go ask
your brother the same thing.

Bathroom door.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.552
It was Rodrick! He made
me! It was his idea.

52:19.637 --> 52:22.055
He had the party! Someone wrote on
the door, so we had to change it!

52:22.139 --> 52:23.932
I knew it. I knew it.

52:24.016 --> 52:26.100
No, Mom, wait! I was
exaggerating a little bit.

52:26.185 --> 52:28.186
It wasn't a party.
It was a band rehearsal

52:28.270 --> 52:29.646
for the talent show.
That's all it was.

52:29.730 --> 52:32.649
We said nobody could come
over. He knew the rules.

52:32.733 --> 52:34.651
Yeah, but, Mom,
if you punish him,

52:34.735 --> 52:36.152
Rodrick's gonna know
I told on him.

52:36.237 --> 52:39.823
We really had a good time this
weekend. But if you do this,

52:39.907 --> 52:42.492
Rodrick and I will never,
ever be friends again.

52:43.494 --> 52:47.539
The idea that one day my kids won't
get to know their Uncle Rodrick?

52:47.623 --> 52:49.666
Or have any
family holidays?

52:50.376 --> 52:52.919
You two really have been getting
along better this week, haven't you?

52:53.629 --> 52:55.547
Yeah. We really have.

[GREG]:
I couldn't believe it!

54:07.745 --> 54:10.288
Rodrick was actually
trying to be nice to me.

54:15.544 --> 54:19.422
Wow! You're a Mom Bucks millionaire!

54:19.506 --> 54:21.424

- Thrift shops.

don't be good at something
you don't want to do.

54:43.656 --> 54:47.116
Guys!
Use clean rags, not...

54:47.201 --> 54:51.496
Just give me that!
I'll do it myself.

54:53.540 --> 54:57.377
Rule number two, always lower
Mom and Dad's expectations.

55:02.132 --> 55:04.717
Hey, I took
a math test today

55:04.802 --> 55:06.469
and I'm pretty sure
I flunked it.

55:06.553 --> 55:07.720
Oh, Greg!

55:07.805 --> 55:10.974
But I got it back,
and look!

55:11.058 --> 55:12.642
I got a C minus.

55:13.894 --> 55:16.187
Well, at least
you didn't fail.

55:18.732 --> 55:21.067
Rule number three,
never do something

55:21.151 --> 55:23.444
when someone else
can do it for you.

55:23.737 --> 55:24.737
(EXCLAIMS)

55:25.656 --> 55:28.199
"100 Years Ago. " I
remember that assignment.

55:28.909 --> 55:30.660
Why write a new one

55:30.744 --> 55:32.620
when there's
a perfectly good paper

55:32.705 --> 55:34.914
already written
by your brother?

55:37.209 --> 55:38.835
Isn't that cheating?

55:38.919 --> 55:40.878
Isn't Mr. Draybick
cheating

55:40.963 --> 55:44.674
by handing out the same
assignment every year?

55:47.261 --> 55:50.596
New binder.
Teachers dig binders.

55:52.391 --> 55:53.641
[GREG]: The thing was,

55:53.726 --> 55:55.685
Rodrick had managed
to get my dad to do...

55:55.769 --> 55:57.979
all his homework
for the past five years.

55:58.856 --> 56:00.690
Which one's
the space bar again?

56:00.774 --> 56:03.651
- Just let me do it, okay?
- Okay.

56:03.736 --> 56:07.071
I would never actually hand in
a paper Rodrick wrote.

56:07.156 --> 56:09.866
But my dad?
That's a different story.

56:09.950 --> 56:12.827
So that's just three of the things
Rodrick has taught me.

56:12.911 --> 56:14.454
He has a lotta cool tips.

56:14.538 --> 56:17.582
I'm not sure Rodrick's tips
are really that cool.

56:20.002 --> 56:22.795
Okay, so the invisible
Chirag joke is still going,

56:22.880 --> 56:24.922
and the whole school
is in on it.

56:25.007 --> 56:27.550
But it looks like Chirag's
discovered our weakness.

56:27.634 --> 56:29.469
Hello, Greg, Rowley.

but I think I may have Class Clown

57:14.348 --> 57:17.934
In conclusion, without last
century's technological advances,

57:18.018 --> 57:23.523
there would be no computers, cell
phones, or modern medical miracles.

57:23.607 --> 57:27.652
And so for that, we salute
and thank our ancestors

57:27.736 --> 57:29.195

57:36.995 --> 57:39.789
Thank you, Holly.
That was excellent work.

57:39.873 --> 57:42.416
I think we have time
for one more.

57:42.501 --> 57:46.337
I have to say that
when I read this paper

57:46.421 --> 57:48.464
I was a bit surprised
by its content.

57:48.549 --> 57:54.387
But more than any other, this
one deserves to be read out loud.

57:56.265 --> 57:57.348
Greg?

57:59.726 --> 58:01.352
Yay, Greg!

58:12.739 --> 58:15.658
Just read it, Greg.
All of it.

58:18.579 --> 58:19.829

58:21.165 --> 58:25.334

about stuff I do not know...

Did flowers even grow?

Were deserts filled with snow?

how important it is to recycle,

58:58.410 --> 59:01.245
we don't mean turning in
your brother's old papers.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.046
I thought Dad helped
you with this paper.

59:10.130 --> 59:12.048
Well, actually,

59:12.132 --> 59:14.634
Dad started writing my
papers because of that paper.

59:14.718 --> 59:16.093
I looked like an idiot!

59:16.511 --> 59:19.931
And the girl from the roller
rink? She laughed at me.

59:20.599 --> 59:21.724
Ouch!

59:21.934 --> 59:24.977
Just do something that
changes her opinion of you.

59:25.062 --> 59:27.939
Like, set a firecracker
off in the classroom. Boom!

59:28.023 --> 59:29.398
Chicks dig bad boys.

59:29.483 --> 59:33.236
Well, actually I was thinking
about writing her a note.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.571
You mean like one
with words on it?

59:35.781 --> 59:37.198
I've got it
all figured out.

59:37.282 --> 59:40.493
I'm gonna pass her a note with a
question on it, but it'll be anonymous.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.745
She'll be like, "I have
to know who wrote this. "

59:42.829 --> 59:44.497
Then later,
I'll walk up to her

59:44.581 --> 59:46.874
and ask her
the exact same question.

59:46.959 --> 59:48.542
It'll blow her mind.

still going well with Rodrick.

My dad should be happy that
I'm hanging out with Rodrick.

But I don't think
he really likes Bill.

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.855
I think what he's worried about
is I'll turn out like Rodrick,

eventually, we'll all turn out like Bill.

My grandpa's favorite is a really
old board game called Gutbusters.

is to read the joke card...

have to try not to laugh.

calling you Fregley the other day.

what happened.

part, my brain just flipped.

of middle school to get over it.

Oh, my brother
spit milk on me.

wasn't actually funny.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.498
It's in the Older Sibling Handbook.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:07.085
Last week, my older sister
put hair remover in my shampoo.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.796
If I hadn't smelled something,
I'd be completely bald by now!

01:15:09.881 --> 01:15:11.548
Why would she do that?

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.675
Duh! 'Cause
she's my sister.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:17.429

01:27:01.341 --> 01:27:04.135

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:14.437

(AUDIENCE GASP)

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:17.148
Oh. Oh.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:21.235
That thing's dead.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.738

him in my pocket too long.

01:27:23.822 --> 01:27:24.822
(BOTH GASP)

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:27.742

And now,
for my grand finale,

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:56.145
the saw-the-lady-in-half
trick!

01:27:58.649 --> 01:28:00.024
If you will.

01:28:04.696 --> 01:28:06.530
(WHISPERS) Push out the feet.
(WHISPERS) Okay.

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:12.286
No trap doors.
No chance of escape.

01:28:13.622 --> 01:28:17.333
I will now miraculously
saw Greg in half.

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:20.544
Wait. Forget it!
I want out!

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.131
What are you doing?

01:28:24.216 --> 01:28:25.299
This is the showstopper!

01:28:25.384 --> 01:28:27.218
Good, then stop!

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.681
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:45.528
That should
have been me!

01:28:53.662 --> 01:28:55.830
We killed. And I didn't have to die!

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:58.416
It was even better than
it was in the rehearsals.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.583
Hi. Can I have your autograph?

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:00.710
Sure. Sure.

pathetic, Greg Heffley!

And we can't do
nothing right

01:30:10.489 --> 01:30:12.364

wanted to say that

you getting Mom to let me play
last night was really cool.

I kind of owed you.

You know, I guess having a
big brother isn't all that bad.

Maybe we don't
always get along,

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.365
but I know he's gonna
be there for me.
