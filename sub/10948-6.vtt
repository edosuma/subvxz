13:12.130 --> 13:14.960
Uh, the Avatar, sir.

13:23.800 --> 13:25.140
( CHOMPING NOISILY )

13:26.850 --> 13:28.770
Blow on it. It's too hot for her.

13:28.850 --> 13:29.850
Allow me.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.190
Oh, my.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.070
Avatar Aang, it's an honor
to have you visit us.

13:38.690 --> 13:42.570
In your opinion, how much longer
do you think the war will last?

13:42.820 --> 13:45.990
I'd like to defeat
the Fire Lord by the end of summer,

13:46.450 --> 13:47.790
but I can't do that

13:47.870 --> 13:50.250
without finding
an earthbending teacher first.

13:50.790 --> 13:54.040
Well, Master Yu
is the finest teacher in the land.

13:54.130 --> 13:56.250
He's been teaching Toph
since she was little.

13:56.630 --> 13:58.630
Then she must be a great earthbender,

13:59.550 --> 14:02.010
Probably good enough to teach
someone else. Ow!

14:05.760 --> 14:07.720
Toph is still
learning the basics.

14:08.390 --> 14:11.140
Yes. And, sadly,
because of her blindness,

14:11.230 --> 14:13.520
I don't think she will ever
become a true master.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.980
Oh, I'm sure she's better
than you think she is.

14:18.070 --> 14:19.070
Uh!

14:29.660 --> 14:32.120
( SNEEZES )

14:34.630 --> 14:36.210
What's your problem?

14:36.290 --> 14:37.800
What's your problem?

14:40.630 --> 14:43.630
Well, shall we move to the living room

14:43.720 --> 14:45.090
for dessert, then?

14:48.560 --> 14:49.640
Good night, buddy.

14:52.230 --> 14:53.310
Hyah!

14:53.600 --> 14:56.520
Relax. Look, I'm sorry about dinner.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.400
Let's call it a truce, ok?

15:01.150 --> 15:04.820
Even though I was born blind,
I've never had a problem seeing.

15:06.490 --> 15:07.950
I see with earthbending.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.700
It's kind of like
seeing with my feet.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.250
I feel the vibrations
in the earth,

15:13.540 --> 15:15.750
and I can see where everything is―

15:16.250 --> 15:20.710
You, that tree, even those ants.

15:23.760 --> 15:25.090
That's amazing.

15:25.180 --> 15:27.050
My parents don't understand.

15:28.180 --> 15:30.510
They've always treated me
like I was helpless.

15:30.970 --> 15:33.230
Is that why you became
the Blind Bandit?

15:33.310 --> 15:34.310
Yeah.

15:34.940 --> 15:37.100
Then why stay here
where you're not happy?

15:37.190 --> 15:38.900
They're my parents.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.690
Where else am I supposed to go?

15:42.110 --> 15:43.360
You could come with us.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.490
Yeah. You guys get to go
wherever you want.

15:46.570 --> 15:50.160
No one telling you
what to do― That's the life.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.410
It's just not my life.

15:55.870 --> 15:57.080
We're being ambushed.

16:14.680 --> 16:17.980
I think you kids
owe me some money.

16:24.280 --> 16:26.610
Whoever took Aang
and Toph left this.

16:27.490 --> 16:29.360
"If you want to see
your daughter again,

16:29.450 --> 16:31.580
bring 500 gold pieces
to the arena."

16:31.660 --> 16:34.200
It's signed "Xin Fu
and the Boulder."

16:34.290 --> 16:35.620
I can't believe it.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.330
I have the Boulder's autograph!

16:40.130 --> 16:43.170
Master Yu, I need you
to help me get my daughter back.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.590
We're going with you.

16:45.920 --> 16:47.130
Poor Toph!

16:47.470 --> 16:48.840
She must be so scared.

16:49.380 --> 16:51.890
You think you're so tough,
why don't you come up here

16:51.970 --> 16:53.970
so I can smack that
grin off your face?

16:54.060 --> 16:55.310
I'm not smiling.

16:55.970 --> 16:57.430
SOKKA: Toph!

16:58.100 --> 17:00.190
Here's your money.
Now, let them go.

17:11.110 --> 17:12.570
What about Aang?

17:12.660 --> 17:16.540
I think the Fire Nation
will pay a hefty price for the Avatar.

17:16.910 --> 17:19.330
Now get out of my ring.

17:35.970 --> 17:37.600
Go. I'll be ok.

17:40.980 --> 17:44.310
Toph, there's too many of them.
We need an earthbender.

17:44.400 --> 17:45.900
We need you.

17:45.980 --> 17:47.860
My daughter
is blind.

17:47.940 --> 17:51.490
She is blind and tiny and helpless
and fragile.

17:51.610 --> 17:53.070
She cannot help you.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.200
Yes, I can.

18:02.370 --> 18:03.710
Let him go.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.590
I beat you all before,
and I'll do it again.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.970
The Boulder takes
issue with that comment.

18:12.880 --> 18:14.010
Wait.

18:19.930 --> 18:21.100
They're mine.

19:07.060 --> 19:08.150
Ugh.

19:09.860 --> 19:10.860
Hit it harder!

19:10.940 --> 19:11.940
I'm trying.

19:45.520 --> 19:47.020
Aah!

19:47.150 --> 19:49.310
( GROWLING )

19:50.730 --> 19:53.440
( GROWLING )

19:56.490 --> 19:58.570
( EARTHBENDER YELLS )

20:13.710 --> 20:16.800
I never knew.
Your daughter's amazing.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.810
( NECK CRACKING )

21:08.850 --> 21:13.110
She's the greatest
earthbender I've ever seen.

21:14.730 --> 21:16.900
Dad, I know it's probably hard

21:17.030 --> 21:18.450
for you to see me this way,

21:18.530 --> 21:20.700
but the obedient little
helpless blind girl

21:20.820 --> 21:22.870
that you think I am
just isn't me.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.790
I love fighting.

21:25.370 --> 21:26.910
I love being an earthbender.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.920
And I'm really, really good at it.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.920
I know I've kept my life secret from you,

21:33.000 --> 21:35.880
but you were keeping me secret
from the whole world.

21:35.960 --> 21:37.550
You were doing it to protect me.

21:38.050 --> 21:40.840
But I'm 12 years old,
and I've never had a real friend.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.760
So now that you see
who I really am,

21:44.850 --> 21:47.310
I hope it doesn't change
the way you feel about me.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.520
Of course it doesn't change
the way I feel about you, Toph.

21:51.060 --> 21:52.650
It's made me realize something.

21:53.310 --> 21:54.360
It has?

21:54.650 --> 21:58.320
Yes. I've let you have
far too much freedom.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.860
From now on,
you will be cared for and guarded

22:00.950 --> 22:02.320
24 hours a day.

22:02.410 --> 22:03.530
But, Dad―

22:03.620 --> 22:06.450
MRS. BEIFONG: We are doing this
for your own good, Toph.

22:06.540 --> 22:09.290
MR. BEIFONG: Please escort
the Avatar and his friends out.

22:09.790 --> 22:12.000
They are no longer
welcome here.

22:12.500 --> 22:14.080
I'm sorry, Toph.

22:14.170 --> 22:17.420
I'm sorry, too.
Good-bye, Aang.

22:22.550 --> 22:24.640
Don't worry. We'll find you a teacher.

22:25.260 --> 22:28.100
There are plenty of amazing
earthbenders out there.

22:28.220 --> 22:29.640
Not like her.

22:36.060 --> 22:37.440
( DISTANT PANTING )

22:39.570 --> 22:41.400
Toph, what are you doing here?

22:41.740 --> 22:43.410
My dad changed his mind.

22:43.490 --> 22:46.120
He said I was free to travel the world.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.410
Well, we'd better get out of here

22:49.490 --> 22:51.450
before your dad changes his mind again.

22:51.910 --> 22:53.330
Good idea.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.460
You're gonna be a great teacher, Toph.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.750
Speaking of which,
I want to show you something.

22:58.880 --> 22:59.880
Ok.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.510
Aah!

23:02.050 --> 23:03.340
Now we're even.

23:03.930 --> 23:05.260
Um, I'll take the belt back.

23:08.640 --> 23:09.640
Ow!

23:10.100 --> 23:11.310
SOKKA: Sorry.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.810
MR. BEIFONG: I know you two
are very different,

23:15.900 --> 23:18.730
but I believe you have
a common interest.

23:23.110 --> 23:25.320
The Avatar has kidnapped my daughter.

23:25.780 --> 23:30.290
I want you to do whatever it takes
to bring her home.
