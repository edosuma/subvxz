00:02.836 --> 00:04.754
<i>Amy: Previously on "Heartland".</i>

00:04.796 --> 00:06.339
- Can you believe it?

00:06.381 --> 00:07.632
We're standing in our
living room right now.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.634
I'm gonna be looking
at this view,

00:09.676 --> 00:11.970
drinking my morning coffee.
- It's pretty amazing.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.930
- You guys have gotten way
too big for your boots.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.682
And it's gonna come back
and bite you.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.434
It's gonna bite you hard.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.977
- Mount Royal University,

00:19.019 --> 00:21.187
turns out they are still
accepting applications.

00:21.229 --> 00:23.148
- (Exhales)
Mom put you up to this,

00:23.189 --> 00:25.400
didn't she?
- No.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.986
Yes, yes of course she did.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.196
- Why do you pretend like
your sister never existed?

00:30.238 --> 00:31.781
<i>Jack: That's not true.</i>

00:31.823 --> 00:33.324
- Well, you never talk
about her.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
Not even with your own family.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.369
I... why I don't get it.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.499
- Because it was my fault.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.585
The reason June died
was my fault.

00:49.507 --> 00:51.092
(Birds chirp)

00:53.428 --> 00:55.221
(Approaching hooves thud)

00:56.431 --> 00:58.516
- (Phoenix snorts)

00:58.558 --> 00:59.434
(Soft whinny)

01:00.643 --> 01:02.187
(Hoove thuds echo)

01:03.396 --> 01:04.647
(Tack jingles)

01:04.688 --> 01:14.657
**

01:14.699 --> 01:27.379
**

01:27.420 --> 01:28.713
(Hooves rustle in the foliage)

01:28.755 --> 01:30.799
(Phoenix snorts)

01:30.840 --> 01:36.721
**

01:36.763 --> 01:38.682
- Where are they?

01:38.723 --> 01:40.642
(Phoenix snorts)

01:42.894 --> 01:44.646
(Patrons chatter, dishes clank)

01:46.064 --> 01:47.816
- You know,
this whole "date" thing

01:47.857 --> 01:48.817
works better when there is
two people involved.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.986
Ty: (Small chuckle)

01:52.028 --> 01:53.780
I know, I know. Sorry.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.532
- (Small chuckle)

01:55.573 --> 01:57.158
We made the right call, Ty.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.954
- Really?
- We did.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.664
It's not like it's forever.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.290
- Telling our contractor
to stop building our home

02:04.332 --> 02:05.875
feels pretty final to me.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.919
- Well, it's not.
And Lee knows that.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.545
We just need time
to get back on our feet.

02:09.586 --> 02:11.631
And clients will return.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.508
It'll all be back to normal.
You'll see.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.884
- Amy, there's only one reason
we can't afford

02:14.926 --> 02:17.762
to build our home right now.
It's me.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.514
I wanted to take Kirk on
as a client.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.182
I didn't listen to you.
- That's not true.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.811
- Well, it's not not true.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.482
Can I get a coffee, please?
- Sure thing.

02:29.524 --> 02:31.276
- Thanks.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.902
(Knocking)

02:32.944 --> 02:34.487
- Peter.
(Knocking)

02:34.529 --> 02:35.864
Yeah. Hi.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.702
- Here, drink this.
- What's going on?

02:40.744 --> 02:42.704
- I need you caffeinated.
Georgie's out for a ride

02:42.746 --> 02:44.456
we need to talk to her
as soon as she gets back.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.374
It's game time.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.418
- (Sighs) Right.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.587
Um, listen, I know this trip
is all about

02:50.628 --> 02:52.464
getting Georgie focused
and everything,

02:52.505 --> 02:54.716
maybe we shouldn't ambush her,
okay?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.801
- Her college application.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.678
- Why do you have it?

02:58.720 --> 03:00.513
- I found it putting away
laundry in her room.

03:00.555 --> 03:02.557
Shoved under her bed.
- Huh.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.476
Doesn't laundry usually
go in drawers?

03:04.517 --> 03:06.436
- No. Peter,
the-the pages are blank.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.313
She hasn't even started
to fill it out yet.

03:08.355 --> 03:09.856
I mean, this is...

03:09.898 --> 03:11.483
this is her last chance
to apply anywhere for fall.

03:11.524 --> 03:12.942
And she is missing it.

03:12.984 --> 03:14.694
We have to talk to her. Now.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.696
- Okay. Can I get dressed?

03:16.738 --> 03:18.823
- Yes. Yeah.
- Okay.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.575
- I'll wait here.
- I'm sure you will.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.868
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.204
(Patrons chatter)

03:28.208 --> 03:29.959
- Coffee, please?
Waitress: You got it.

03:30.001 --> 03:31.419
- Ty. Ty, don't.

03:32.837 --> 03:34.714
- (Sighs) What do you want?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.466
- Look, we need to talk.
- No we don't.

03:36.508 --> 03:38.593
- Yes we do.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.845
I want this to stop. Okay?

03:40.887 --> 03:42.681
Those anonymous posts,
the negative comments?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.516
I know you wrote them.
You need to take them down.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.934
- I don't need to do anything.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.647
- Look, okay. I'm sorry.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.065
This has been all a big
misunderstanding.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.942
If you can just please
take them down.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.819
That would be great.
I-I appreciate that.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.612
- Oh well, since you said
the magic word.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.992
No. I told the truth.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.911
And people need to know
who you two really are.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.621
In fact...

04:06.663 --> 04:08.248
hey, listen, every one!
- Hold on!

04:08.289 --> 04:10.750
- These two, right here?
Almost killed my horse.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.836
- Kirk... stop!
- And this one.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.963
Horse whisperer?!
More like horse killer.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.589
- That's enough, all right!
- Ooh! Ooh!

04:16.630 --> 04:18.425
Tough guy, now? Are we?
- Get out of my face, okay?

04:18.466 --> 04:19.926
- That's enough!
- Violent, also!

04:19.968 --> 04:21.553
See that, folks?
- Hey! Time to leave.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.596
Kirk: Tim...
- Time to leave.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.806
<i>Kirk: I'm just trying to get</i>
<i>a cup of coffee.</i>

04:24.848 --> 04:26.725
<i>That's all.</i>

04:28.643 --> 04:30.395
- What the hell is wrong
with you? Huh?

04:33.356 --> 04:35.525
(Warning alarm sounds)
- Environment Canada has issued

04:35.567 --> 04:37.485
a severe storm watch
for the Foothills area.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.446
Funnel clouds have been
reported

04:39.487 --> 04:41.197
in the Bragg Creek region.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.241
<i>And potential tornado activity</i>
<i>could continue</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:45.785
<i>as far east as Millarville</i>
<i>and perhaps Hudson.</i>

04:45.827 --> 04:47.912
Residents in this area
shaded in red

04:47.954 --> 04:49.789
are advised to prepare
themselves and stay vigilant

04:49.831 --> 04:52.000
as this storm approaches.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.544
- Okay. We need to get back
to Heartland. Now.

04:54.586 --> 04:55.837
- Yeah.

04:58.048 --> 05:03.553
**

05:03.595 --> 05:13.313
**

05:13.355 --> 05:18.651
* And at the break of day
you sank into... *

05:18.693 --> 05:20.695
* Your dream *

05:20.737 --> 05:22.572
* You dreamer *

05:22.614 --> 05:24.699
* Oh, oh, oh, oh... *

05:24.741 --> 05:26.951
* You dreamer *

05:28.995 --> 05:32.874
* You dreamer *

05:38.546 --> 05:40.048
- So, how much time do we have?

05:40.090 --> 05:42.050
- A few hours,
it's hard to say.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.593
- Honestly, Jack,
I've looked everywhere.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.512
Will's horses have
just disappeared.

05:45.553 --> 05:46.971
- Well, if that's true,

05:47.013 --> 05:48.973
then the storm is coming
right through here.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.767
Horses are better
than any weatherman.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.353
So I found all
the window boards.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.897
- Well, that's a bit extreme,
isn't it, Jack?

05:55.939 --> 05:58.733
- When you hear "funnel cloud",
you can't be too prepared.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.235
Now, I'm gonna need some
help in the barn.

06:00.276 --> 06:02.237
- Yeah. I can do that.
- Me too.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.948
- No. We need an extra set
of hands at the dude ranch.

06:04.989 --> 06:07.033
Right, Peter?

06:07.075 --> 06:09.285
- Yeah. Yeah,
you should come with us.

06:09.327 --> 06:11.204
Jack: Okay. That means Tim,
Ty... you're on house duty.

06:11.246 --> 06:12.831
Start with the windows.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.582
- Mom, I'm coming with you guys.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.126
- No, honey.
You'll be safer at home.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.003
- Please, the storm
doesn't scare me.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.674
- You okay, Luke?

06:22.716 --> 06:24.968
- I'm fine. I just wanna help.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.970
- All right. Well, why don't
you look after Lyndy

06:27.012 --> 06:28.221
while we prep the ranch, okay?

06:28.263 --> 06:29.639
- Okay.
- All right.

06:29.681 --> 06:31.599
Less talk. More action.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.685
- All right. There you go.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.186
Amy: All right, Lyndy,
you stay here with Luke.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.063
- (Whispers) Come here.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.357
Hey.
- What?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.943
- I just wanna make sure you're
still on board with our plan.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.738
- On board? What? What? Now?
- Yeah, of course.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.322
We can prep for the storm
and talk to Georgie.

06:46.364 --> 06:48.116
Two birds, one stone.

06:48.158 --> 06:49.868
- No. We're not gonna coerce
our daughter

06:49.909 --> 06:52.203
into making life choices in
the middle of a tornado, Lou.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.705
- Peter. It is literally now
or never.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.415
You're leaving tomorrow!

06:55.457 --> 06:57.709
- Oh. Can we just deal with one
storm at a time here?

07:00.628 --> 07:02.130
Okay, fine.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.923
Yeah, we can talk about it
if it comes up

07:03.965 --> 07:05.800
in the natural course of
conversation.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.677
It has to be organic.
Don't force it.

07:07.719 --> 07:08.803
- Organic. Yes, absolutely.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.140
Ty: Amy, wait.

07:12.182 --> 07:13.850
Listen, we need to talk about
what happened at Maggie's.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.769
- Do we?

07:15.810 --> 07:17.812
- Kirk shouldn't have called us
out like that.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.230
- And you shouldn't have let
him push your buttons.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.232
I told you not to go over
there, Ty!

07:21.274 --> 07:22.984
- Amy, I was defending you!
- And I appreciate that, but--

07:23.026 --> 07:25.028
- Did you hear what he said?!
- Yeah.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.946
And what were you gonna do?!
What were you thinking, huh?!

07:26.988 --> 07:28.448
You gonna go over there
and just start a fight

07:28.490 --> 07:30.200
in the middle of the diner?
- Amy, I wasn't thinking!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.077
Okay? Kirk makes me crazy.
He was insulting you.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.079
What did you want me to do?
- No.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.955
You know, I do not wanna have
this conversation right now.

07:35.997 --> 07:36.915
We have way too much
to get done.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.502
Tim: Ty! Windows. Now.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.463
- All right!

07:47.926 --> 07:49.219
(Remi barks in the distance)

07:49.260 --> 07:51.012
(Boards thud)

07:53.890 --> 07:56.309
(Screen door shuts)
- All right, tools are packed.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.061
The wind's picking up
so we better get going.

07:58.103 --> 07:59.896
- Okay.
Georgie, let's go!

07:59.938 --> 08:01.231
- Come on, girls, let's go!

08:01.272 --> 08:03.108
- I should really be staying
with Amy and Ty

08:03.149 --> 08:04.859
if they're gonna be letting
the horses go.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.986
- Let them go?
Why would they do that?

08:07.028 --> 08:09.155
- It's what you do
during big storms.

08:09.197 --> 08:10.824
- We're gonna be back in plenty
of time to help, okay?

08:10.865 --> 08:13.118
Let's go.

08:13.159 --> 08:15.745
Can you get the door?

08:15.787 --> 08:16.996
Thank you.
(Drill whirs)

08:19.457 --> 08:20.917
- Hey, are you okay?

08:20.959 --> 08:22.794
- (Sighs) I'm fine.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.087
Could ask you the same thing.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.964
- Oh, I'm all right.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.967
This isn't my first storm,
you know.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.927
- I meant about June, Grandpa.

08:30.969 --> 08:33.346
We haven't talked about
what you told me.

08:33.388 --> 08:35.849
- You know,
I shouldn't have said anything.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.767
Just forget it.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.977
Besides, this is definitely
not the time.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.023
- Fine.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.190
(Dramatic whoosh)

08:45.650 --> 08:55.243
**

08:57.120 --> 08:58.705
- Yeah. We-we're fine.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.331
No-no-no.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
Don't cut your parents'
visit short for me.

09:04.252 --> 09:06.171
Yes, we'll stay safe.
I promise.

09:06.212 --> 09:08.965
I know. I wish you could
be here, too.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.717
- Lou! Can I have the--
- Yeah.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.927
Okay. I gotta go. Yeah.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.055
I love you.
Okay, bye.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.931
(Beeps phone off)

09:16.973 --> 09:19.059
- The "l-word," huh?

09:19.100 --> 09:20.977
Things are good between you
and Mitch, I guess?

09:21.019 --> 09:23.021
- Yeah. Yeah,
they're really good.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.731
And you and Jen?
Things are good there, too?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.192
- Uh, yeah. Amazing.

09:28.902 --> 09:31.404
- Um, guys, what about these
planters?

09:31.446 --> 09:34.074
They're like a million pounds.
- They're fine.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.743
But I'm loving how motivated
you've been today.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.870
Right, Peter?
- Yeah.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.122
- And speaking of motivated...

09:41.164 --> 09:42.832
how's that college
application coming?

09:42.874 --> 09:44.042
It's due soon, right?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.129
You know, if you need any help
hashing things out,

09:48.171 --> 09:49.881
Peter and I are always happy
to help.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.341
- No it's okay.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.301
No help needed.
- Okay.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.803
- Okay, hon.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.306
Real organic, Lou.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.393
(Drawer bangs shut)

10:01.434 --> 10:03.520
- Hey, Ty,

10:03.561 --> 10:05.313
there is still work to do
out here.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.065
We gotta-we gotta move those
jumps out of the ring.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.316
- I'm sorry, I can't right now.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.151
I gotta put this paperwork away.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.279
- Look, I know where you were
coming from this morning.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.281
Trust me.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.659
It was all I could do not
to punch Kirk myself. But...

10:19.411 --> 10:21.329
it's not how you fix this.
- I know.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.707
- Okay. Good.

10:23.748 --> 10:26.376
But I hope you know it still
needs to be fixed and soon.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.378
It can't go on like this.

10:28.420 --> 10:30.547
Your business is non-existent.

10:30.588 --> 10:33.174

- Tim, I know. Okay?

10:34.926 --> 10:35.927
And I know what I gotta do.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.263
- Well, good, do it fast.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.056
For Amy's sake.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.766
She didn't asked
for any of this.

10:41.808 --> 10:43.685
- Any of what?

10:45.937 --> 10:48.148
- Tim.
- Yep.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.858
- What is going on?

10:51.693 --> 10:52.986
- There's something I gotta do
before this storm hits, okay?

10:55.113 --> 10:56.614
Kirk posted another comment.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.159
This time using his real name.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.453
He's threatening to take out a
restraining order against us.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.246
- Are you kidding me?

11:03.288 --> 11:04.372
- Amy I gotta do something.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.875
I'm not gonna sit back
and let this guy bury us.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.418
- Yeah, but what are you
gonna do?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.378
- I'm gonna go
and I'm gonna talk to him.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.505
- Ty?
- I'm just gonna talk, okay?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.966
I'm gonna talk,
I'm gonna clear the air.

11:15.008 --> 11:17.469
Make peace. Okay?
Before he posts anything more.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.137
- I don't like this, Ty.
The storm is coming.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.306
- There is time, okay?

11:21.348 --> 11:23.933
I got this.
I have to do this, all right?

11:23.975 --> 11:25.352
It's the only way
to make him stop.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.854
- No. We need you here. Ty?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.441
- Amy, this is gonna break us.

11:31.483 --> 11:33.568
Okay?

11:33.610 --> 11:35.362
I need to fix this.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.364
Or we'll break.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.326
Okay?

Yeah. I don't know why
you're prepping the cellar.

that bad.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.135

Jack, come on!

12:55.775 --> 12:58.111
- Last time we were all
here together...

12:58.153 --> 13:01.406
was when Georgie had
that broken arm, right?

13:04.075 --> 13:07.120
- Agh! I think you're right.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.496
That was a long ago, huh?

13:08.538 --> 13:10.123
- And I caught a fish...
even with my cast.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.167
- Yeah. That was a fun day.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.210
<i>- (Lou giggles)</i>

13:14.252 --> 13:17.255
You know, I think that story
says a lot about you, Georgie.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.799
And just how determined
you've always been.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.384
And I know that you're gonna
take that determination

13:21.426 --> 13:23.303
with you when you do...

13:23.345 --> 13:25.347

do you think you're doing

13:45.533 --> 13:47.369
on my property?
- Look, I don't wanna fight,
Kirk.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.120
I just wanna talk.
- I wasn't joking

13:49.162 --> 13:50.872
about that restraining order.
I won't be harassed.

13:50.914 --> 13:53.458
- I'm not trying to harass you,
okay? I just wanna solve this.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.460
There's gotta be something
I can do.

13:55.502 --> 13:58.046

has made a full recovery.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.513
It would set my mind at ease

14:06.554 --> 14:08.181
if I could just take a look
at him.

14:08.223 --> 14:09.766
You know, make sure
he's all right.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.351

I give a damn

14:11.393 --> 14:13.436
about the state of your mind?
Huh?!

you gone. Now!

- Dad hasn't hounded me once
since being home!

19:27.584 --> 19:29.961
Because he actually believes
that I know what I'm doing.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.005
- Georgie, your dad isn't
just here just to have fun

19:32.047 --> 19:33.923
vacation with the family, okay?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.925
He's here to help me stage
an intervention.

19:35.967 --> 19:38.094
- An intervention!?

19:38.136 --> 19:39.763
- Okay, that's a pretty strong
word but--

19:39.804 --> 19:41.639
- I don't believe this.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.058
- Ever since coming home
from Europe

19:43.099 --> 19:45.185
you have been floundering, okay?

19:45.226 --> 19:47.562
You used to have so much
purpose and direction.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.981
And then Phoenix got sick
and Kim walked away--

19:50.023 --> 19:51.775
- Kim did not walk away. I did.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.651
- Fine. But ever since then

19:53.693 --> 19:55.653
it's like you've stopped caring.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.697
About show jumping
or college or anything.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.741
- That's not fair.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.743
- Sweetheart, we're just-
we're just concerned.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.536
- Yes. Especially since you
didn't handed in

20:03.578 --> 20:05.538
your college application.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.707
- How do you know
I didn't handed it in?

20:07.749 --> 20:12.253
**

20:13.588 --> 20:15.215
- Daddy coming?

20:15.256 --> 20:16.508
- Daddy should be here soon,
Sweetheart.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.677
- I hope not.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.179
He'd be taking his life in
his hands driving right now.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.264
(Wind gusts outside,
objects clatter)

20:29.020 --> 20:32.065
- I have to get Boots!
- Hey! Luke!

20:32.107 --> 20:33.983
You've gotta stop!
You've gotta stop!

20:34.025 --> 20:36.528
- Let go of me!
- Listen! Listen to me!

20:36.569 --> 20:38.655
You cannot go out there!
Do you understand?!

20:38.697 --> 20:40.532
You'll get hurt or even worse.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.117
- What do you care?
You don't even like me anymore.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.619
Not since I found
that stupid box.

20:44.661 --> 20:45.787
- (Yells) Get away from that!
- (Gasps)

20:52.002 --> 20:53.920
(Horse whinnies nervously)

20:53.962 --> 20:55.922
- Easy boy! Easy!

20:55.964 --> 20:57.924
(Wood clatters)

20:57.966 --> 21:00.093
Here!
- I got it! I got it!

21:00.135 --> 21:01.928
Don't let yours get away
from you!

21:01.970 --> 21:03.638
Come on!
(Horse grunts)

21:05.181 --> 21:06.766
- Come on, pull 'em out!

21:06.808 --> 21:08.727
- Come on, horse!

21:08.768 --> 21:10.770
Stay away! Stay away!

21:10.812 --> 21:13.481
(Horse whinnies nervously)
- Come on!

21:13.523 --> 21:14.941
Sarge! Here we go!

21:14.983 --> 21:16.735
Let's go!

21:18.862 --> 21:21.489
(Wind howls outside)

21:25.035 --> 21:26.411
- (Softly) Grandpa.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.877
- You need to know...

21:33.918 --> 21:35.503
that I loved my sister
very much.

21:42.427 --> 21:43.845
Growing up,

21:45.805 --> 21:48.099
it always felt like...

21:48.141 --> 21:50.352
me and June against the world.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.022
Especially against our father.

21:56.483 --> 21:57.692
He was tough.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.615
He was... he was a tough man.

22:03.656 --> 22:05.575
Real old school when it came
to discipline.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.369
I tell you that.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.000
He drank a fair bit.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.879
And that's when you really
wanted to steer clear.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.341
June and I we...

22:22.926 --> 22:24.761
we tried to avoid him
as best we could.

22:24.803 --> 22:26.471
I got into rodeo. And...

22:29.057 --> 22:30.558
she came down here.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.980
I set up that desk for her.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.774
So she could get some peace...

22:37.816 --> 22:39.484
away from Dad.

22:41.820 --> 22:44.572
Writing and drawing that...

22:44.614 --> 22:46.157
that was her passion.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.913
But she also loved horses.

22:54.165 --> 22:56.167
She had a way with them.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.211
I saw so much of her in Marion

22:58.253 --> 22:59.921
and now in you.

23:02.799 --> 23:04.175
I got a chance to rodeo
in the states:

23:04.217 --> 23:05.927
Nashville, Tennessee.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.184
But she knew that me leaving

23:13.226 --> 23:15.520
meant she had to stay,

23:15.562 --> 23:16.688
help Dad on the ranch.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.775
But she wanted me to go.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.445
She... she was so sure
I would win it all.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.950
I...

23:28.992 --> 23:30.952
I just didn't realise that...

23:32.370 --> 23:34.080
that would mean losing her.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.710
(Spinner rattles)

23:38.752 --> 23:39.961
- (Tight exhales)

23:43.340 --> 23:44.966
- I still can't believe you
guys went through my things.

23:46.718 --> 23:48.303
- That's your take away
from this?

23:48.345 --> 23:50.263
- For all you know I could've
submitted online!

23:50.305 --> 23:52.182
- Well, did you?
- No...

23:52.223 --> 23:53.933
- Sweetheart, we're just
worried about you, okay?

23:53.975 --> 23:55.852
You've always been so goal
orientated. Now we feel like

23:55.894 --> 23:57.062
maybe you don't know
what you want anymore.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.022
- We just wanna make sure that
you're on the right path.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.815
- I can't win with you guys!

24:00.857 --> 24:02.108
- What is that supposed
to mean?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.694
When I'm driven and motivated,
you say I'm too intense.

24:04.736 --> 24:06.738
And now, that I'm taking a
break, I'm not intense enough!

24:06.780 --> 24:08.031
- There's a difference between
taking a break,

24:08.073 --> 24:09.949
and getting completely
left behind.

24:09.991 --> 24:11.951
- I won't get left behind!
- If you don't hand in

24:11.993 --> 24:13.703
that application, you won't
eligible for late admission.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.205
- And what happens then?
- I don't know, okay?!

24:15.246 --> 24:17.248
- Okay, calm down--
- No.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.209
I don't have all the answers.
But is that so bad?

24:19.250 --> 24:20.960
Can you guys really tell me,

24:21.002 --> 24:22.837
that you've always stayed
on "the right path"?

24:22.879 --> 24:24.381
- This isn't about us--
- No!

24:24.422 --> 24:26.841
You can't sit there and tell me

24:26.883 --> 24:28.760
that you haven't questioned
what you wanted in life.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.345
Because last time I checked,
you two are divorced,

24:30.387 --> 24:31.846
so you've been known
to change your minds.

24:34.808 --> 24:36.685
Both: (Laughing)

24:38.353 --> 24:40.230
- It's a good point.
- Yeah. It's true.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.940
Well-played.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.483
- (Small chuckle)

24:47.779 --> 24:50.031
- Grandpa, how did June die?

24:52.325 --> 24:54.369
- She was helping our dad
pick rocks from the field.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.080
<i>We used this old homemade</i>
<i>stone boat,</i>

24:57.122 --> 24:59.541
<i>it was pulled by a team</i>
<i>of horses.</i>

24:59.582 --> 25:02.627
<i>That day, June was driving.</i>
<i>It was her first time.</i>

25:02.669 --> 25:04.337
(Horse whinnies)

25:04.379 --> 25:05.964
Team got away on her.
She was dragged.

25:06.006 --> 25:07.716
(Hooves thunder)

25:10.051 --> 25:11.636
- I'm so sorry.

25:15.056 --> 25:17.058
- With June gone,
Dad's drinking got worse.

25:20.520 --> 25:22.147
Until he was pretty much
addicted,

25:22.188 --> 25:23.732
and almost cost us this ranch.

25:26.234 --> 25:28.570
You know, I didn't ask
to be a rancher.

25:30.405 --> 25:32.866
But it was on me to keep
Heartland running.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.826
I didn't have a choice.

25:36.411 --> 25:39.330
Besides, I owed it to June.

25:39.372 --> 25:41.332
She loved this place so much.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.084
- And you didn't?
- No.

25:45.920 --> 25:47.255
Up until then, I wanted out.

25:50.342 --> 25:52.260
Took a little time but...

25:52.302 --> 25:55.347
I eventually realized that

25:55.388 --> 25:57.223
even in death,

25:57.265 --> 25:58.767
June had given me a gift.

26:01.102 --> 26:02.270
She gave me this ranch,

26:03.855 --> 26:04.773
this family,

26:06.149 --> 26:07.692
this life.

26:12.364 --> 26:14.115
She made me who I am.

26:17.202 --> 26:18.995
- I don't know how you can
blame yourself for her death,

26:19.037 --> 26:20.789
you weren't even here.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.837
- Driving the stone boat
was my job. I was gone.

26:27.879 --> 26:29.130
She took my place.
And it got her killed.

26:32.008 --> 26:34.135
<i>- C'mon, Jack...</i>

26:34.177 --> 26:36.805
that doesn't mean
it's your fault.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.936
- If I hadn't left,
she would be alive.

26:45.980 --> 26:48.817
(Wood clatters,
wind gusts outside)

26:52.404 --> 26:53.988
And that...

26:55.615 --> 26:58.993
is something I have had
to live with

27:00.203 --> 27:01.996
for a long time.

27:04.165 --> 27:06.334
(Wood clatters,
wind gusts outside)

27:09.004 --> 27:10.839
(Horse whinnies)
Ty: Switch him around!

27:10.880 --> 27:12.132
- I've got him!
- Come on!

27:12.173 --> 27:14.092
- I got him! I got him!
C'mon, Sarge!

27:14.134 --> 27:15.969
Ty: Let's go, come on!

27:16.011 --> 27:17.887
Come on, boy! Move!

27:17.929 --> 27:19.764
- Come on, Sarage!
Come on.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.059
Come on, Sarage!

27:23.101 --> 27:24.853
- Come on! Let's go!

27:24.894 --> 27:26.187
<i>(Wood creaking)</i>

27:27.647 --> 27:29.941
- We gotta get out of here now.

27:29.983 --> 27:31.860
- I'm not leaving without
Sarge!

27:31.901 --> 27:34.070
Come on, Sarge!
Do it for Carla!

27:34.112 --> 27:36.281
Do it for Carla.

27:36.322 --> 27:38.408
(Sarge whinnies)

27:38.450 --> 27:40.201
(Wood crashes)
Come on!

27:42.162 --> 27:44.372
Oh! Oof!
(Loud crash)

27:45.874 --> 27:51.796
**

27:56.217 --> 27:58.011
(Ominous music, wind howls)

28:00.347 --> 28:02.057
(Electricity flickers)

28:03.516 --> 28:05.226
- There she is.

28:08.521 --> 28:10.190
(Small laugh)

28:23.578 --> 28:25.080
- What's this, Grandpa?

28:27.248 --> 28:28.416
- June's journal.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.421
She took this with her
everywhere.

28:35.799 --> 28:38.259
She was always real secretive
about what she put in there.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.889
But one day she did
show me this.

28:51.648 --> 28:54.401
I decided to make that
the symbol for Heartland.

28:57.445 --> 28:59.114
Guess it was my way of...

29:00.615 --> 29:03.034
keeping her here with me.

29:03.076 --> 29:04.911
(Electricity fizzles)

29:04.953 --> 29:06.287
(Thunder rumbles)

29:07.872 --> 29:17.215
**

29:17.257 --> 29:19.384
(Wind howls fiercely)

29:22.971 --> 29:25.265
(Pained grunts)

29:25.306 --> 29:27.142
(Objects clatter
in the distance)

29:30.270 --> 29:31.813
- (Effort grunts)

29:33.023 --> 29:34.733
Kirk!

29:34.774 --> 29:36.443
(Objects clatter
in the distance)

29:36.484 --> 29:38.820
Hey! Hey!

29:40.405 --> 29:43.074
Kirk, wake up!

29:43.116 --> 29:44.492
(Wood boards clatter)

29:46.161 --> 29:48.413
(Effort grunts)

29:48.455 --> 29:50.290
(Overlapping talking)

29:50.331 --> 29:53.084
(Loud thunder booms)
- Whoa! Wow!

29:53.126 --> 29:54.586
- We're gonna blow away!
- (Chuckles)

29:54.627 --> 29:56.588
No we're not.

29:56.629 --> 29:58.673
- They did in
"The Wizard of Oz."

29:58.715 --> 30:00.342
- Aw... we're okay, honey.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.637
- It's nice, you know.

30:04.679 --> 30:06.514
Being together.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.521
Relax. I'm not asking you guys
to get remarried or whatever.

30:13.563 --> 30:15.357
(All chuckle)

30:15.398 --> 30:17.525
I just miss being a family
like this sometimes.

30:20.111 --> 30:22.197
You'll go back to Vancouver.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.240
Georgie will go to college...
- Or not...

30:24.282 --> 30:27.202
which is fine... could be fine.

30:29.662 --> 30:31.790
- I wanna go to college, Mom.

30:31.831 --> 30:34.042
- Then what's holding you back?

30:35.543 --> 30:37.754
- I don't know.

30:37.796 --> 30:41.216
Maybe I'm sad like Katie
that things changing.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.054
College just seems really...
final.

30:48.181 --> 30:49.974
- Why?

30:51.685 --> 30:53.603
- Saying I wanna go
to college means

30:53.645 --> 30:55.438
saying goodbye to competing.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.607
- What? No it doesn't have to.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.275
- It does if I wanna compete
at the level

30:59.317 --> 31:00.402
that I reached at Euro-camp.

31:02.487 --> 31:04.447
Europe was amazing.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.241
I thought it would take me
to the Olympics.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.409
But...

31:09.160 --> 31:10.537
when I got back,
everything kinda fell apart.

31:13.289 --> 31:15.250
It made me realise that
that dream was silly.

31:17.252 --> 31:19.421
And college isn't silly.
College is real.

31:21.464 --> 31:24.050
- Georgie, you don't have
choose one or the other.

31:25.635 --> 31:27.429
If anyone can juggle show
jumping and freshman year,

31:27.470 --> 31:29.097
you can.

31:30.765 --> 31:32.767
- Your mom's right, sweetheart.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.477
You can handle anything.

31:34.519 --> 31:36.604
From psych 101 to competing...

31:36.646 --> 31:38.732
to meddling parents...

31:38.773 --> 31:40.275
- (Small laugh)

31:47.782 --> 31:50.368
- (Effort grunts)

31:50.410 --> 31:53.038
Kirk, wake up!

31:53.079 --> 31:54.998
Kirk, wake up!

31:55.040 --> 31:56.666
Hey!

31:56.708 --> 31:59.210
Hey! Wake up!
- What?!

31:59.252 --> 32:01.379
- Come on, I can't move!

32:01.421 --> 32:03.631
I know. I need your help
to get this off of us, okay?

32:05.759 --> 32:07.427
We gotta push on three!

32:07.469 --> 32:09.137
Okay?
- Okay!

32:09.179 --> 32:11.681
- One, two, three...

32:11.723 --> 32:13.892
(Big effort grunts)

32:13.933 --> 32:15.643
- I can't.
- Come on! Push harder!

32:17.187 --> 32:18.480
One, two, three...

32:20.148 --> 32:22.150
(Big effort grunts)

32:24.402 --> 32:26.321
- Ty!

32:27.739 --> 32:29.783
(Pained grunts)

32:29.824 --> 32:33.119
- Come on! Come on!

32:36.289 --> 32:37.999
(Tired grunts)

32:40.168 --> 32:42.629
(Loud crashing)

32:44.381 --> 32:45.507

Go!

Come on! Inside!

(Wind howls outside)

33:03.525 --> 33:05.276
- What?

33:05.318 --> 33:07.737
Jack, what is it?

33:07.779 --> 33:09.364
- It's June's last entry.

33:11.783 --> 33:13.451
She wrote it on the day
she died.

33:17.372 --> 33:19.207
(Reads) "Dad's letting me help.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.169
I'll be out in the fields today.

33:24.838 --> 33:26.464
Just like Jack!

33:29.342 --> 33:32.220
He's down in Nashville
and I know he'll win big

33:33.847 --> 33:37.559
because this is Jack's chance...

33:37.600 --> 33:39.519
to shine."

33:39.561 --> 33:47.277
**

33:47.318 --> 33:49.738
I can't...
I can't do it.

33:49.779 --> 33:51.322
I'm sorry.

34:04.794 --> 34:07.672
- (Reads) "I was proud to help
Jack in my own small way,

34:51.466 --> 34:53.467
<i>Following your dream</i>
<i>allowed June to follow hers.</i>

34:55.804 --> 34:58.306
<i>You gave June her big chance.</i>

35:02.018 --> 35:03.645
- Big chance for what?

35:05.522 --> 35:07.649
- Well, Jack,

35:07.691 --> 35:11.277
June died doing
what she loved to do.

35:14.447 --> 35:17.951
Wouldn't we all choose
to go that way if we could?

35:17.992 --> 35:20.662
- She didn't resent you
for leaving, Grandpa.

35:20.704 --> 35:22.247
She was happy.

35:23.581 --> 35:26.459
And I think somehow,

35:26.501 --> 35:28.503
she wanted you to know that.

35:34.843 --> 35:36.511
- (Mournful sigh)

35:45.603 --> 35:47.355
(Leaves rustle in the wind)

35:47.397 --> 35:48.857
(Door creaks open)

35:54.362 --> 35:55.655
- (Exhales) Oh...

36:00.160 --> 36:02.370
Why is it every time
you're around,

36:02.412 --> 36:03.538
something horrible happens
to me?

36:06.791 --> 36:08.209
- (Small chuckle)

36:10.712 --> 36:12.505
- (Sighs) Look at this.

36:12.547 --> 36:15.050
- Hey Kirk... you...

36:15.091 --> 36:16.718
you mentioned a name
in the barn.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.929
Carla?

36:19.971 --> 36:21.389
Who is that?

36:24.517 --> 36:25.810
- My wife.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.564
Sarge... he was her horse.

36:30.982 --> 36:33.443
(Horses whinny)
She died.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.236
Last winter.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.367
- I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.

36:41.951 --> 36:43.661
- That damn horse.

36:45.872 --> 36:47.582
Every time I look at him,
I see her.

36:52.003 --> 36:53.338
That's why I wanted
to sell him.

36:56.424 --> 36:57.926
Get rid of him.

37:01.805 --> 37:03.264
- But you saved him, Kirk.

37:06.559 --> 37:07.936
- Yeah, I did, didn't I?

37:10.980 --> 37:13.274
<i>(Small chuckle) Funny, huh?</i>

37:15.777 --> 37:17.445
Hey.

37:20.407 --> 37:21.741
Ty...

37:24.786 --> 37:26.579
you saved him, too.

37:28.039 --> 37:29.749
You saved them all...
including me.

37:33.753 --> 37:35.463
You were the hero today.
I know that.

37:41.886 --> 37:43.722
I'm gonna make sure everyone
else does, too.

**

38:06.202 --> 38:07.996
(Doors creak open)

38:14.919 --> 38:16.338
- Well, looks like the house
weathered the storm.

38:19.716 --> 38:21.134
I can say the same for you.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.761
- Very funny. I'm fine.

38:25.305 --> 38:27.474
Hey, Luke,
you better go find boots.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.103
- Well, if that horse
has blown away,

38:32.145 --> 38:33.605
it's on you.
- Boots!

38:36.191 --> 38:37.692
<i>- Grandpa.</i>

- Grandpa I... I'm sorry

38:47.952 --> 38:50.372
I didn't mean to push
down there about June.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.089
- June's words

38:59.130 --> 39:01.716
were something I've wanted
to hear my entire life...

39:03.927 --> 39:05.845
and I can't thank you enough.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.893
(Phone vibrates)

39:11.935 --> 39:13.895
- Ty... I'm sorry.

39:13.937 --> 39:16.189
- You better talk to him.
(Phone beeps on)

39:16.231 --> 39:18.525
- Ty, are you all right!
Yeah!

39:18.566 --> 39:20.527
Yeah, we're okay.

39:20.568 --> 39:22.028
Yeah, we're fine.

39:22.070 --> 39:23.905
(Dramatic whoosh)

39:30.203 --> 39:31.746
- (Small chuckle)

39:35.250 --> 39:36.918
(Running footsteps
crunch in the gravel)

39:40.505 --> 39:42.424
(Sighs)

39:46.386 --> 39:50.140
- (Exhales) What a mess.
- Yeah. I'll clean it up.

39:50.181 --> 39:52.684
Georgie: Mom! Dad! Let's go!

39:52.726 --> 39:54.394
- Yeah, We're coming!

39:54.436 --> 39:56.855
Hey listen, thank you
so much for helping me

39:56.896 --> 39:58.940
navigate everything
with the girls today.

39:58.982 --> 40:00.859
No, you were great.

40:00.900 --> 40:02.861
- So were you.

40:02.902 --> 40:04.612
- It's hard to believe last
time we were here,

40:04.654 --> 40:06.948
we were about to break up.

40:08.908 --> 40:10.785
But we put on a brave face
for the kids, right?

40:10.827 --> 40:12.996
I think we still do.

40:13.038 --> 40:14.622
- I agree. Yeah.

40:15.915 --> 40:17.792
- I'm proud of us.

40:17.834 --> 40:20.045
You know, I mean it's not
the most conventional set up,

40:20.086 --> 40:23.006
but somehow,
we make it work, right?

40:23.048 --> 40:25.175
- I think so. Yeah.

40:25.216 --> 40:26.634
(Small chuckles)

40:28.011 --> 40:29.596
- I really love you, you know.

40:31.097 --> 40:32.891
- I love you, too.

40:32.932 --> 40:34.642
(Phone vibrates, chimes)

40:35.977 --> 40:37.896
- I should take this.
- Yeah.

40:37.937 --> 40:40.315
(Beeps phone on)
- Mitch! Hi!

40:40.357 --> 40:42.817

40:53.787 --> 40:55.747
I found Boots!

40:55.789 --> 40:57.916
- Yeah, I knew he wouldn't
be far.

40:57.957 --> 41:00.251
- You are one lucky guy.

41:00.293 --> 41:02.170
Amy: Ty!

41:09.135 --> 41:10.845
Did you fight?

41:10.887 --> 41:12.097
- No. We didn't fight.

41:12.138 --> 41:13.723
- Okay. Are you okay?

41:13.765 --> 41:15.684
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

41:15.725 --> 41:17.519
In fact...

41:17.560 --> 41:20.146
I have a feeling we're both
gonna be fine from now on.

41:20.188 --> 41:28.029
**

41:28.071 --> 41:29.906
Both: (Laugh)

41:29.948 --> 41:34.369
* I look around to find
the way it all began *

41:34.411 --> 41:36.705
* The years,
they've turned *

41:36.746 --> 41:39.124
* Like the heart of man *

41:39.165 --> 41:41.334
* But I'll say
that I'm grateful *

41:41.376 --> 41:43.837
* For the time that has past *

41:43.878 --> 41:47.090
* And I'll stay right
where I am *

41:47.132 --> 41:50.927
**

41:50.969 --> 41:53.179
* Well, I raise my glass *

41:53.221 --> 41:55.473
* With the unfortunate ones *

41:55.515 --> 41:57.892
* We're broken and tired... *

41:57.934 --> 41:59.644
- How are things looking up
here?

41:59.686 --> 42:02.022
- Not too much damage, really?

42:02.063 --> 42:04.232
Of course, I guess, there
wasn't that much to ruin.

42:07.152 --> 42:09.738
Jack.

42:09.779 --> 42:11.322
Those things you said
about your dad.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.033
I had no idea.

42:14.617 --> 42:16.953
That his drinking could've cost
you the ranch.

42:16.995 --> 42:18.747
That you were,
you were dealing with that.

42:18.788 --> 42:20.915
Marion never said.

42:20.957 --> 42:22.834
- Well, she didn't' say
because she didn't know.

42:25.086 --> 42:26.254
What's it to you, anyway?

42:28.757 --> 42:31.217
- I don't know.

42:31.259 --> 42:33.136
Guess maybe it just sheds
a little light

42:33.178 --> 42:35.638
on why you took such a hard
line on me and my addictions

42:35.680 --> 42:36.931
all those years ago.

42:40.268 --> 42:42.103
Why you wanted Marion to cut me
out of her life so completely.

42:46.232 --> 42:48.485
I guess... maybe I just
understand you a bit more.

42:48.526 --> 42:50.570
- Yeah, you think so?

42:55.867 --> 42:57.285
- Yeah.

42:58.912 --> 43:00.372
Yeah, who knows?

43:00.413 --> 43:02.165
One day I might understand you
completely.

43:02.207 --> 43:04.125
- (Small laugh)

43:04.167 --> 43:06.044
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

43:16.054 --> 43:18.223
* They all end up the same *

43:18.264 --> 43:20.100
