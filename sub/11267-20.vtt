"Blue Ivy"
Closed Captioned

00:01.376 --> 00:03.002
Previously on 90210:

00:03.128 --> 00:05.046
Working together puts
pressure on our relationship.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.090
I've already made up my mind.
I'd do anything for you,

00:07.215 --> 00:08.968
even give up music.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.052
Isn't that what you
were going to say?
Uh, yeah.

00:11.178 --> 00:12.346
DR. HARPER: Hi Erin, this is

00:12.471 --> 00:13.889
Dr. Harper from
the genetic screening.

00:14.014 --> 00:15.724
We've received your results.

00:15.850 --> 00:19.102
Please call us back to schedule
a review as soon as possible.

00:19.227 --> 00:20.521
Where were you
yesterday afternoon?

00:20.646 --> 00:21.522
Liam was with me.

00:21.647 --> 00:22.606
Drove me to a
doctor's appointment

00:22.731 --> 00:24.274
that I didn't want anyone
to know about.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.734
It's my fault you
and Jen are fighting.

00:25.860 --> 00:27.319
I should've just told you
you're the one I wanted.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.570
NAOMI: Sorry about everything.

00:28.696 --> 00:29.697
Especially

00:29.822 --> 00:31.239
Preston Hillingsbrook.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.867
I ran into a mutual friend

00:32.992 --> 00:34.201
who told me
the most scandalous secret.

00:34.326 --> 00:36.704
PRESTON: All you needed

00:36.829 --> 00:37.496
was a date with a hunky boy

00:37.621 --> 00:39.289
in board shorts.

00:39.414 --> 00:41.876
I am just smiling because we
found a very worthwhile cause

00:42.001 --> 00:43.627
to donate our
first check to.

00:43.752 --> 00:45.212
And Caleb's kind
of great, too.

00:45.337 --> 00:48.883
You look like
you need to talk.

00:49.008 --> 00:50.133
IVY: How could you

00:50.258 --> 00:51.050
lie to me, Raj?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.177
Did you think I was

00:52.302 --> 00:54.304
gonna get over you and...
and be happy one day?

00:54.429 --> 00:55.890
And then the minute
I actually started

00:56.015 --> 00:58.517
living my life, then
that would be the perfect time

00:58.642 --> 01:00.644
to find out that
you had lied to me?

01:00.769 --> 01:02.813
And that you
died here... alone.

01:13.490 --> 01:17.202
(coughs)
Did you save the universe?

01:17.327 --> 01:19.162
We saved the universe.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.289
Then tell my boss

01:21.415 --> 01:24.292
I'm putting in for overtime.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.213
DIRECTOR: Cut!

01:28.338 --> 01:29.798
That's a wrap on Liam Court.

01:29.924 --> 01:31.926
(scattered applause)

01:34.511 --> 01:36.889
Hey.
There you go.

01:37.014 --> 01:37.556
That, uh, that take
felt a little stiff.

01:37.681 --> 01:39.725
You think I should
ask for another one?

01:39.850 --> 01:40.893
No. Don't even
think about it.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.270
In fact, it's time to start
talking about what's next.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.689
Ah, which is why I'm
trying to set up a meeting

01:45.814 --> 01:47.399
with Cynthia Bennett,
the indie producer.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.818
She practically
owns Sundance.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.529
Whoa. Aren't those movies
for, like, trained actors?

01:52.654 --> 01:54.281
Liam, you're ready.
Trust me.

01:54.406 --> 01:56.491
Will I have to
show my ass?

01:56.617 --> 01:59.078
Uh, only if you want
to win an Oscar.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.871
Look, leave
everything to me.

02:00.996 --> 02:03.082
I'm not gonna let
anything get in the way

02:03.206 --> 02:05.208
of our dreams coming true.
All right.

02:05.333 --> 02:06.961
Hey. I've got
to get your mic.
Okay.

02:11.339 --> 02:13.759
(whispers):
Great job.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.014
Mm. Sorry about that.
No, no, no, no.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.390
I'm the one
who should apologize.

02:20.515 --> 02:22.183
I appreciate you
coming with me

02:22.309 --> 02:23.602
last week to
take the cancer test,

02:23.727 --> 02:24.478
but I did not mean

02:24.603 --> 02:26.897
to make things weird
with Vanessa.

02:27.022 --> 02:28.607
She'll get over it.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.609
Still can't believe
she thought there was

02:30.734 --> 02:32.319
something going
on between us.

02:32.444 --> 02:35.196
(chuckles)
I know, it's crazy, right?

02:38.784 --> 02:39.701
So, hey, um....

02:39.827 --> 02:41.578
when do you get the results?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.081
Uh, I asked the doctor
to mail them,

02:44.205 --> 02:45.707
but they haven't come yet.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.250
I don't want to
think about it

02:47.375 --> 02:49.086
until after Raj's funeral.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.671
Yeah.

02:50.796 --> 02:53.007
Have you thought about
talking to Navid?

02:53.132 --> 02:55.092
No. That would only
complicate things.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.136
What do you mean?

02:57.260 --> 02:58.762
I mean, if he knew...

02:58.887 --> 03:00.472
he'd come back, you know?

03:00.597 --> 03:03.142
The whole reason
I didn't tell him

03:03.266 --> 03:04.977
how I felt before he left
for Princeton

03:05.102 --> 03:07.562
was because I didn't want to get
in the way of his new life.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.982
Yeah, but you need
someone to talk to, you know.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.734
Someone whose girlfriend isn't
gonna get insanely jealous.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.610
(chuckles)

03:13.735 --> 03:15.320
Look, Liam,
thank you for everything.

03:15.445 --> 03:18.365
You've been
an amazing friend.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.908
This is my problem, and...

03:20.034 --> 03:23.620
from here on out,
I'm gonna deal with it alone.

03:24.663 --> 03:26.414
Good job in there.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.763
Tell me your deep,
dark secrets.

03:41.889 --> 03:45.059
I want to know everything
about PJ Hillingsbrook.

03:45.184 --> 03:46.852
You could check
my Wikipedia page.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.896
It's shockingly accurate.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.355
ANNIE: Get a room!

03:50.480 --> 03:51.481
There's only, like,
18 of them in this place.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.608
You know what?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.402
Wilson's right.
I should go.

03:55.527 --> 03:57.779
Wilson sucks.
Thank you very much.

03:57.905 --> 04:00.532
Ew. Uh, PJ, sorry to talk
business right now,

04:00.657 --> 04:02.826
but at the rate
our bags are selling,

04:02.951 --> 04:04.411
we're gonna have to upgrade
some of the equipment

04:04.536 --> 04:05.704
at the factory...
All right,

04:05.829 --> 04:08.248
I'll get you a check
by the end of the day.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.168
And I will see you later.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.926
Yeah, he's a serial killer.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.095
Seriously.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.971
He probably has heads
in his fridge.
Why don't

04:23.097 --> 04:25.057
you just call Jen and ask her
what she was talking about

04:25.182 --> 04:26.934
when she told you that PJ
had some scandalous secret.

04:27.059 --> 04:30.270
Okay, genius, I've tried that;
I can't get in touch with her.

04:30.395 --> 04:31.563
She's away at some
silent yoga retreat

04:31.688 --> 04:32.856
in the south of France
for another week.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.858
Here's another crazy
thought: ask him.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.902
Annie.

04:37.027 --> 04:38.737
That is the last resort.

04:38.862 --> 04:40.114
Our relationship
is going great.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.157
I really think PJ
could be the one.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.617
I'm not gonna mess
everything up

04:43.742 --> 04:44.952
by acting like I
don't trust him.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.037
You work with him.
Have you noticed
anything strange?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.997
Not really.
He's just your basic

04:49.123 --> 04:50.207
self-absorbed trust-fund kid.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.917
My world is full of them.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.460
Uh, sorry.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.544
Let's talk about you.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.130
How's that cute
surfer boy of yours?

04:56.255 --> 04:57.464
You mean Caleb?

04:57.589 --> 04:58.632
Not happening.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.926
He's already in
a committed relationship.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.803
He wants to become a priest.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.512
Oh, God.
Exactly.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.806
He's in seminary,

05:05.931 --> 05:09.434
and next year, is going to take
a vow of celibacy.

05:09.559 --> 05:10.769
Then you still have time.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.230
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
I'm already going to hell.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.232
Don't really need to add to it
by defrocking a priest.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.025
Bu it's just as well.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.693
We should probably
be focused on Ivy.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.279
Yeah, you're right.

05:20.403 --> 05:21.529
How do you think she's doing?

05:21.655 --> 05:23.406
Well, this morning,
she was making

05:23.531 --> 05:25.492
chocolate chip pancakes,
like you would any morning

05:25.617 --> 05:27.577
that wasn't the day
of your husband's funeral.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.412
She's acting
like everything's fine.

05:29.537 --> 05:31.081
Because I am fine.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.916
There she is!
Hey, you.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.417
You guys, please
stop looking at me

05:34.542 --> 05:36.503
like somebody
kicked my puppy.

05:36.628 --> 05:37.587
Honey, it's okay to be sad.

05:37.712 --> 05:38.672
I know.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.090
Of course,
I'm sad.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.050
But, like I said,
I knew this was coming

05:42.176 --> 05:43.802
when I first got
involved with Raj,

05:43.927 --> 05:45.762
so let's just get
through this day, okay?

05:45.887 --> 05:46.847
Of course.
Whatever you say.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.515
Okay.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.191
Yeah, I know.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.905
How's she holding up?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.782
It's hard to tell.
I don't think

06:05.907 --> 06:07.492
she's even cried yet.
ADRIANNA: Well, I'll be doing

06:07.617 --> 06:08.827
enough of that
for all of us.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.537
Did you bring
the tissues?

06:10.662 --> 06:11.705
Uh... no.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.167
I left them in the car
with my phone, apparently.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.751
Okay. I'm on it.
Okay.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.419
Okay, I'm glad you guys
are here,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.755
but I swear,
if one other person tells me

06:20.881 --> 06:21.798
that they are sorry
for my loss...

06:21.923 --> 06:24.301
NAOMI:
Guys, look who's here.
ADRIANNA: Oh, Navid!

06:24.425 --> 06:25.510
Hey, guys.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.386
Navid, did you just fly
all the way

06:27.512 --> 06:28.638
from New Jersey?
Uh, technically,

06:28.763 --> 06:30.057
from Philly, Omaha,
then Denver.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.350
Everything was booked up
for spring break.

06:31.474 --> 06:33.227
I didn't know
if I'd make it in time.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.686
Hey, Ivy.
Hey.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.104
So sorry for your loss.

06:36.230 --> 06:36.980
I'm fine.

06:38.481 --> 06:39.983
Really, I just... I...

06:40.108 --> 06:40.942
wish you didn't go
through all that trouble.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.819
Thank you.

06:47.366 --> 06:48.783
Yeah.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.668
Hey.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.129
Hi.

07:01.255 --> 07:03.382
How are things
at Princeton?

07:03.506 --> 07:04.883
Fine, I guess.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.969
Just took a while to get used
to being the new guy.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.428
But, uh, I'm working
for the college paper.

07:10.931 --> 07:15.143
Well, that's good.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.646
(sighs)

07:18.772 --> 07:20.190
Still can't believe about Raj.

07:20.315 --> 07:22.525
Guess I have been
pretty out of touch.

07:22.650 --> 07:26.280
Ade told me Dixon just, uh,
practically had a stroke.

07:26.405 --> 07:26.863
Can't believe
he didn't call me.

07:26.988 --> 07:27.447
I mean,
what's his deal?

07:27.572 --> 07:29.074
I'm sure he knew
you were having

07:29.199 --> 07:30.409
a great time, you
know, at school

07:30.533 --> 07:32.244
and didn't want to
mess that up for you.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.578
Yeah, maybe.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.580
I'm still going to kick his ass.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.125
So how have you been?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.667
I'm great.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.669
Well, it was good
seeing you.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.306
(phone ringing)

07:52.431 --> 07:54.849
Dixon's phone.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.059
WOMAN:
This is Carter Thomas's office

07:56.184 --> 07:57.602
at House of K Records.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.020
Is Dixon available?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.022
Uh, no, but can I
take a message?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.441
We'll try back.

08:02.565 --> 08:04.567
Carter wants to set a meeting
to give Dixon feedback

08:04.692 --> 08:06.153
on the tracks he sent in
last week.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.071
Wait. Last week?

08:09.156 --> 08:11.450
I'll tell him.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.202
DIXON:
Hey.

08:14.328 --> 08:15.287
Service is about to start.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.621
We should get in there.
Who was that?

08:18.081 --> 08:19.582
Wrong number.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.460
Oh. Cool.
Come on.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.990
Hey. Cut it out.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.116
We're at a funeral.

08:53.241 --> 08:53.992
I'm setting up
that meeting.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.618
Well, stop it.

08:55.743 --> 08:56.661
We should be
focused on Raj.

08:56.786 --> 08:57.787
I am.

08:57.912 --> 08:59.039
Life is short,

08:59.164 --> 09:01.875
and we have to embrace
every opportunity.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.835
(gasps)

09:03.960 --> 09:05.253
Looks like we're on
for this afternoon.

09:05.379 --> 09:09.132
God, am I amazing
or what?

09:09.257 --> 09:11.009
VANESSA: But not
as amazing as Silver.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.760
Vanessa, come on.

09:12.886 --> 09:13.970
I told you what
she's going through.

09:14.095 --> 09:15.680
Must be hard
to be at a funeral

09:15.805 --> 09:17.140
of a guy who just
died of cancer

09:17.265 --> 09:18.350
when you might have
the cancer gene.

09:18.475 --> 09:19.893
Okay.

09:20.018 --> 09:21.561
Her boyfriend is back
in town from Princeton.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.937
Why don't you
let her cry

09:23.063 --> 09:24.647
on his shoulder
for a change?

09:24.772 --> 09:26.024
He's not
her boyfriend anymore.

09:26.149 --> 09:28.193
Besides, she
doesn't want him

09:28.318 --> 09:30.111
to know
about the test.

09:34.366 --> 09:35.409
ADRIANNA: Why wouldn't
Dixon tell me that he

09:35.534 --> 09:36.826
already sent tracks
to a producer?

09:36.951 --> 09:38.578
He didn't have to lie.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.080
Maybe he didn't lie.

09:40.205 --> 09:41.415
Why don't you just ask him?

09:41.540 --> 09:42.832
I can't.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.209
The doctor said
not to stress him out.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.835
And he already feels
like I'm smothering him.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.296
There's got to be some kind
of simple explanation.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.758
You know what? You're right.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.386
I mean, when nobody else
let me in, Dixon trusted me.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.555
I'm going to do
the same for him.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.474
If there's something
going on, he'd tell me.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.351
I signed a recording contract.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.437
What?! Dude,
that's great.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.104
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.147
Just keep it down.

10:06.273 --> 10:06.940
Ade doesn't know yet.

10:07.065 --> 10:08.983
Why not?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.486
Because the label
didn't want her.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.780
They said her past
would hold us back.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.990
Oh. She's going to find out.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.367
Well, maybe not, okay?

10:17.492 --> 10:18.743
Uh, I already told her

10:18.868 --> 10:20.454
I started working
on music again.

10:20.579 --> 10:22.414
And, I don't know,
maybe in a few weeks,

10:22.539 --> 10:23.748
I'll tell her
the label liked it

10:23.873 --> 10:25.459
and wants to sign me.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.335
Dude, that's the
worst plan ever.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.547
Okay. Well, I mean, what else
am I supposed to do, huh?

10:30.671 --> 10:32.757
I mean, I don't want
to hurt her feelings.

10:32.882 --> 10:33.633
This girl
is really important

10:33.758 --> 10:35.676
to me, man.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.720
But so is my career, and...

10:37.845 --> 10:39.973
and opportunities like this
only happen once in a lifetime.

10:40.098 --> 10:43.017
I get it. But look what happened
to me when I lied to Silver.

10:43.143 --> 10:46.646
Even after all this time, she...
she can barely talk to me.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.358
(sighs) This tandoori
is making me sweat.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.694
I'm going to go get
some fresh air.

11:01.411 --> 11:02.787
Hey.

11:02.912 --> 11:06.374
Hey.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.335
Pretty intense
in there, huh?

11:08.460 --> 11:10.044
Yeah, I guess.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.838
Vanessa, right?

11:11.963 --> 11:15.258
Yeah. Sorry.

11:15.383 --> 11:17.302
I, I feel like know you.

11:17.427 --> 11:21.139
Silver talks about
you all the time.

11:21.264 --> 11:22.307
She-she does?

11:22.432 --> 11:23.642
Mm.

11:23.766 --> 11:28.605
She must be really
relieved you're back.

11:28.729 --> 11:30.773
I can't imagine what
she's going through.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.401
What do you mean?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.862
Being at a funeral

11:35.987 --> 11:39.991
for a guy who just
died of cancer.

11:40.116 --> 11:43.578
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:45.330 --> 11:48.833
Oh, my God.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.168
Oh, my God,
she didn't tell you?

11:50.293 --> 11:51.752
I have such a big mouth.

11:51.878 --> 11:52.753
I'm sorry. This is
not my place.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.505
W-Wait, please.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.509
Tell me, what's
going on with Silver?

11:57.634 --> 11:58.593
Okay, but I'm
only telling you

11:58.717 --> 12:01.555
because I'm really
worried about her.

12:06.893 --> 12:08.520
Hey, guys, can we
get out of here?
Two hours of

12:08.645 --> 12:09.854
grieving is pretty
much my limit.

12:09.979 --> 12:10.522
Yes. Come on.
Let's get you home.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.856
Ivy, wait.

12:13.483 --> 12:15.527
Mrs. Kher, hi.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.528
You were Raj's wife,

12:16.653 --> 12:19.780
and I know how much
you loved each other.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.578
That's why I think

12:24.703 --> 12:26.913
he would like you
to have his ashes.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.748
I'm...

12:31.418 --> 12:32.669
I'm, I'm sorry.

12:32.793 --> 12:33.712
I-I...

12:33.836 --> 12:35.129
I-I can't. Um...

12:44.305 --> 12:45.098
It's weird having Raj

12:45.223 --> 12:47.392
back in the house,
but I have to say

12:47.517 --> 12:49.143
it's a nice urn.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.229
I just wish Ivy
would talk to us.

12:51.354 --> 12:52.647
So we can say what?

12:52.813 --> 12:53.523
I offered to take
her shopping,

12:53.648 --> 12:55.358
she said no.
I am out of ideas.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.902
You're right.
She should talk

12:58.027 --> 12:59.237
to someone
with a spiritual perspective.

12:59.362 --> 12:59.946
Someone like Caleb.

13:00.071 --> 13:02.198
The PILF?

13:02.323 --> 13:02.990
"Priest I'd like to..."

13:03.116 --> 13:04.618
Yeah, I got it.

13:04.743 --> 13:06.244
What? I was
gonna say

13:06.369 --> 13:07.870
"Priest, I'd
like to friend."
Mm.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.163
He can help Ivy,

13:09.289 --> 13:10.582
and, you know,
teach you

13:10.707 --> 13:11.541
about the
Seven Deadly Sins.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.000
Okay, stop!

13:13.126 --> 13:15.169
I'm only going to
see him for Ivy's sake.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.547
Okay, I'm pretty sure
lying is a sin, too.

13:17.672 --> 13:18.839
(chuckles)

13:18.965 --> 13:20.425
I'm off.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.677
PJ and I have
a couple's massage.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.596
The suspense is killing me.
I'm gonna get him relaxed

13:24.721 --> 13:27.014
and then I'm just gonna
ask him point-blank

13:27.140 --> 13:28.141
what his big secret is.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.892
(text alert tone sounds)

13:30.017 --> 13:32.186
What's the matter?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.272
It's PJ.

13:34.397 --> 13:36.566
"Have to cancel spa date.
Something came up."

13:36.691 --> 13:38.777
Hmm, guess he has
to serial-kill someone.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.902
(chuckles)

13:44.115 --> 13:46.200
Liam's movie is
gonna open huge,

13:46.326 --> 13:48.202
and the offers will
come rolling in,

13:48.328 --> 13:49.537
but, you know,
in the meantime,

13:49.663 --> 13:50.829
we want to
do something

13:50.955 --> 13:54.793
that really showcases
Liam's real talent.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.336
Great. This is
the modern-day version

13:56.461 --> 13:57.378
of The Brothers Karamazov.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.422
The script is brilliant.

13:59.547 --> 14:03.510
And Liam is
perfect for Alex.

14:03.635 --> 14:05.553
That's the lead.
We're out

14:05.679 --> 14:07.054
to Ryan Reynolds for that role.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.641
I'm offering Liam
the role of Tomas.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.976
The stable hand?

14:12.101 --> 14:13.561
He barely has any lines.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.104
Yeah, But he, he sweats a lot

14:15.229 --> 14:17.315
and he takes
his shirt off.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.651
I thought you said you want
to showcase Liam's talents.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.111
What are you trying to say?

14:22.236 --> 14:23.946
Honey, you're adorable--
the camera loves you--

14:24.071 --> 14:25.573
but it wouldn't hurt
to take a few acting lessons.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.200
You don't know
what you're talking about.

14:27.325 --> 14:29.118
Liam's a star.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.871
Maybe, but I'm offering
the stable hand.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.665
You can take it or leave it.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.712
I think we're done here now.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.629
Yup.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.882
(wry chuckle)

14:43.007 --> 14:44.551
(knocking)

14:48.429 --> 14:49.930
What are you
doing here?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.057
What is this
about a cancer test?

14:51.182 --> 14:53.560
Who told you?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.478
That doesn't matter.
The question is, why didn't you?

14:55.603 --> 14:57.938
Because, Navid,
it's no big deal.

14:58.064 --> 15:00.441
No big deal? Silver,
you're being tested
for the cancer gene.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.068
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

15:02.193 --> 15:03.778
Well, you weren't here to tell.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.321
What does that mean?

15:05.446 --> 15:07.532
It means you left, okay?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.534
Oh, so because I decided
to go to school,

15:09.659 --> 15:10.993
everyone forgets how
to use a cell phone.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.829
How are you making this
about you?

15:12.953 --> 15:13.872
We're not even together anymore.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.541
We may not be together,
but I still care about you.

15:16.666 --> 15:17.333
Well, look, Navid,
this is something

15:17.458 --> 15:18.710
that I need to go through alone.

15:18.835 --> 15:20.336
But those test results
don't just affect you!

15:20.461 --> 15:23.631
How could you be so selfish?!

15:23.757 --> 15:25.592
Wow. See, I thought the selfish
thing would've been

15:25.717 --> 15:27.677
to call you and ask you
to come home.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.137
But I didn't do that
because I didn't want

15:30.263 --> 15:31.598
to mess up your
amazing new life.

15:31.723 --> 15:32.849
Now I get it.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.351
Silver...
No, forget it, okay?

15:35.476 --> 15:37.144
You're not gonna make me
feel guilty about this.

15:37.270 --> 15:39.230
It's my life, and I don't
really care what you think.

15:39.355 --> 15:40.273
Hey, I'm sorry.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.816
Get the hell out!

15:46.070 --> 15:46.821
(door slams)

15:46.946 --> 15:49.990
♪ ♪

15:59.876 --> 16:02.378
Thanks for agreeing
to talk to Ivy.

16:02.503 --> 16:05.089
Hey, it's worth a shot.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.091
Sometimes people
feel more comfortable

16:07.216 --> 16:08.843
talking to strangers.

16:08.968 --> 16:09.761
Yeah.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.806
Let me just rinse off here,
get out of this suit.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.061
So you're not really
big on advertising

16:19.186 --> 16:20.647
the whole "becoming
a priest" thing, huh?

16:20.772 --> 16:24.275
Not so much. It tends
to freak people out.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.652
They start to act
differently around me.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.612
Yeah, I could see that.

16:28.738 --> 16:29.697
It's like they think

16:29.823 --> 16:31.908
I'm gonna condemn them
to hell or something.

16:32.032 --> 16:35.453
Truth is,
I'm just a regular guy.

16:35.578 --> 16:37.580
I have flaws
just like everyone else.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.545
Oh, if only.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.006
(house music playing)

16:47.131 --> 16:49.801
(phone rings)

16:49.926 --> 16:51.594
Hey, this is Dixon.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.346
It's Carter. Look, I still want
to talk to you about your
tracks,

16:53.471 --> 16:54.555
but something just came up:

16:54.681 --> 16:56.933
Haley Reinhart is playing
a showcase

16:57.057 --> 16:59.101
this afternoon at Saint Rocke.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.103
Her backup guy got sick
and had to bail.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.648
How'd you like to come down
and join her for a song?

17:03.773 --> 17:06.526
Uh... are you serious?

17:06.651 --> 17:08.234
Uh, we haven't rehearsed
anything.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.737
You know her stuff, right?

17:09.863 --> 17:12.699
If you can get down here
in an hour, you're in.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.200
All goes well, Haley
might ask you to fill in

17:14.325 --> 17:15.868
on the last leg of her tour.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.872
Uh, oh, man! That, that's
amazing, but I don't know.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.790
This is happening way too fast.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.042
I haven't even told...

17:26.546 --> 17:27.171
uh, all my friends.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.048
This is a big deal.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.676
Opportunities like this
don't come along every day.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.428
Uh, cool. Uh, count me in.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.389
Great, I'll e-mail you
all the details.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.432
Cool.

17:40.852 --> 17:41.519
IVY:
Look, I'm only doing this

17:41.644 --> 17:43.396
because my friends
are worried about me.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.648
It's not like I actually
have anything to say, okay?

17:45.773 --> 17:47.066
Then screw it.
Let's go surf.

17:47.191 --> 17:50.862
I'll tell Annie
I fixed everything.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.363
You know
I'm not Catholic, right?

17:52.488 --> 17:53.197
I mean, I'm not even sure
I believe in God.

17:53.322 --> 17:54.615
That's okay.

17:54.741 --> 17:59.370
The God I believe in
can handle that.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.955
Okay, so what do
you want me to say?

18:01.080 --> 18:01.956
I mean, what do you
want to talk about?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.666
You want me to tell you
how weird it was

18:03.791 --> 18:04.834
to see Raj in
a frigging bottle?

18:04.959 --> 18:06.002
You want me talk

18:06.126 --> 18:07.628
about how depressing
the whole thing was?

18:07.754 --> 18:10.172
I mean, the whole,
the whole funeral, okay,

18:10.297 --> 18:11.883
it was just...

18:12.008 --> 18:13.342
it just wasn't Raj.

18:13.467 --> 18:14.928
It wasn't, it wasn't like him.

18:15.053 --> 18:16.345
He was, he was funny

18:16.470 --> 18:20.725
and he was charming
and he was just...

18:20.850 --> 18:22.643
he was just full of life.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.811
Everybody says good-bye
in their own way.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.314
Maybe that's how Raj's
family needed to do it.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.816
Doesn't make it right for you.

18:29.943 --> 18:31.360
Yeah.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.445
Your last name's Sullivan,
right?

18:32.570 --> 18:33.821
You ever been to an Irish wake?

18:33.947 --> 18:35.364
Nope.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.784
I've been to a
million of them.

18:37.909 --> 18:39.410
We drink a lot
of whiskey,

18:39.535 --> 18:41.203
swap stories about
the dead guy,

18:41.328 --> 18:44.707
and pretty much
raise hell.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.751
That's how we
say good-bye.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.920
Does it make you
feel better?

18:49.045 --> 18:51.631
When it doesn't end
in a fistfight, yeah.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.674
Something like that
sound more like Raj?

18:55.718 --> 18:57.177
Actually, yeah.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.596
Let's do that.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.642
Come on.

19:11.776 --> 19:14.445
♪ ♪

19:20.284 --> 19:24.038
Okay, PJ, where are you
really going?

19:34.214 --> 19:36.258
(car alarm blaring)

19:36.383 --> 19:38.136
Cops! Cops! Run!

19:47.937 --> 19:49.647
Naomi.

19:49.772 --> 19:51.231
Oh!

19:51.357 --> 19:53.818
(panting):
PJ. Oh, my God.

19:53.943 --> 19:56.070
I'm so embarrassed.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.864
You can't find a good
bathroom downtown anywhere.

19:57.989 --> 19:58.865
What's going on?

19:58.990 --> 20:00.074
(sighs)

20:00.199 --> 20:02.660
Okay, fine.

20:02.785 --> 20:04.328
Jen heard from one
of your friends

20:04.453 --> 20:05.830
that you had some
kind of secret.

20:05.955 --> 20:06.539
And she was right.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.082
I knew you were too
good to be true.

20:08.207 --> 20:10.292
I knew it.
Open it.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.752
No, I'm not gonna open that.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.337
Do you have any idea how many
times I've been arrested

20:13.462 --> 20:14.547
this year alone?
Open the box.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.397
Cigars?

20:31.522 --> 20:32.940
They're Cubans.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.067
So, technically,
yes, they are illegal.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.359
My guy's a little paranoid.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.403
You smoke cigars?

20:37.528 --> 20:40.073
That... no, that-that
can't be your big secret.

20:40.198 --> 20:41.574
It's a filthy habit.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.118
Picked it up while
campaigning for Arnold.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.327
Wait.

20:45.452 --> 20:48.664
For Ar-- Oh, my God.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.751
You're a Republican.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.836
That's it! Jen
hates Republicans!

20:53.961 --> 20:55.922
I mean, it's a practical
deal-breaker for her.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.381
But it's not for me!

20:57.506 --> 20:58.758
I can live with that!

20:58.883 --> 20:59.717
I can totally
live with that!

20:59.842 --> 21:01.052
I am so relieved.

21:01.177 --> 21:02.053
I'm sorry.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.931
I should've
trusted you.

21:05.056 --> 21:08.601
You're right.

21:08.726 --> 21:11.353
You should have.

21:16.525 --> 21:19.278
It was so humiliating.

21:19.403 --> 21:21.655
Yeah, I don't usually pretend
to pee in front of a guy

21:21.781 --> 21:23.157
until we've been dating
at least a month.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.158
Okay, you know what?

21:24.283 --> 21:25.243
I'm serious, all right?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.286
I-I really, really,
really screwed this up.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.955
Do you think maybe
you could talk to PJ

21:29.080 --> 21:30.330
and tell him that
I'm not a total freak?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.331
You mean lie to him?

21:31.457 --> 21:32.332
Yes, exactly!

21:32.458 --> 21:33.793
And then you can go to

21:33.918 --> 21:35.169
your hot little priest
for confession; it's a win-win.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.336
Fine.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.797
Only because I'm already
going to talk

21:37.922 --> 21:39.257
to PJ about our charity.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.759
But please promise me
that you'll stop making up

21:41.884 --> 21:44.053
fictional problems and be glad
that the guy you're into

21:44.178 --> 21:45.596
isn't taking a vow of celibacy.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.597
I promise.

21:46.722 --> 21:48.348
And don't forget, we
have that Irish wake

21:48.474 --> 21:49.475
for Raj on the
beach tonight.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.310
Right. Anything I can do?

21:51.435 --> 21:52.895
Yeah, actually.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.354
Bring Raj.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.120
Wow, you're reading
a book on acting?

22:09.245 --> 22:10.246
Yeah. You know,
some of this method stuff

22:10.370 --> 22:12.081
actually makes sense.

22:12.206 --> 22:15.417
Like when I got impaled by the
alien, I could've been thinking

22:15.542 --> 22:17.962
about getting into
the motorcycle accident...

22:18.087 --> 22:20.006
with an alien.

22:20.131 --> 22:22.008
I don't know, I haven't
finished the chapter yet.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.968
Okay, well, if you want
to read something,

22:24.093 --> 22:26.304
try this.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.264
Congratulations.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.891
You're playing Alex.

22:31.017 --> 22:31.976
What?

22:32.101 --> 22:32.810
Yeah.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.061
What are you talking about?

22:34.187 --> 22:36.022
You know how it is.

22:36.147 --> 22:38.565
A bunch of people passed,
so you're in.

22:38.691 --> 22:40.109
I-I thought that Cynthia lady
hated me.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.611
Eh, she was bluffing.

22:42.736 --> 22:44.404
She wanted to get in your
head so we'd take less money.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.364
But when I went
back and told her

22:46.490 --> 22:48.826
you weren't going to be in
the movie at all, she caved.

22:48.951 --> 22:51.495
Now learn your lines; you
start shooting next week.

22:53.789 --> 22:56.876
In the meantime, um,
I'm gonna look for a new place.

22:57.001 --> 22:59.212
What's wrong with this place?

22:59.337 --> 23:02.340
Liam, we can't keep living
in the back room of a bar.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.133
Okay, wait, this is all
happening so fast.

23:04.258 --> 23:05.467
Of course it is.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.970
That's the way I planned it.

23:08.095 --> 23:10.597
I'm not hitching my wagon
to anything less than a star.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.482
Hey.
NAVID: Hey.

23:20.607 --> 23:23.069
Uh, Dixon said I could crash
here for a couple of days.

23:23.194 --> 23:24.778
Hope-hope that's cool.
Of course.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.197
I mean, as long as
you don't mind splitting

23:26.322 --> 23:28.115
two chili dogs three ways.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.243
Oh. Uh, Dixon-- he just left.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.660
Really?
Yeah.

23:31.785 --> 23:32.703
I mean, we had
this whole day planned

23:32.828 --> 23:35.915
to eat comfort food
and watch cartoons.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.583
Uh, think he had
a doctor's appointment.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.377
Since when?
I mean, I write

23:39.501 --> 23:41.337
all of his appointments
down in this book.

23:45.799 --> 23:47.385
Yeah, he doesn't have one today.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.179
Oh, well, you know, the guy
basically just had a stroke.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.805
So he probably just
forgot to tell you.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.266
Or he could be lying.

23:53.391 --> 23:55.601
Ade, listen.

23:55.726 --> 23:58.604
Sometimes people
don't tell you everything.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.981
Doesn't mean
they don't care about you.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.194
It could just mean
they're trying to protect you.

24:05.319 --> 24:07.363
Yeah, I guess you're right.

24:07.487 --> 24:09.365
Of course I'm right.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.284
I'm totally taking
out that chili dog.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.202
Oh, wait,
let me just,

24:13.327 --> 24:15.079
uh, make sure
I packed my antacid.

24:30.594 --> 24:32.638
Did Naomi send you
here to spy on me?

24:32.763 --> 24:34.140
I heard about everything.

24:34.265 --> 24:37.435
And I know Naomi can get
a little out of hand sometimes,

24:37.559 --> 24:40.062
but she really is one of
the best people I know.

24:40.187 --> 24:42.440
She has a huge heart,
and-- God knows why--

24:42.606 --> 24:44.566
she thinks you're amazing.

24:44.691 --> 24:46.986
So will you please
give her a second chance?

24:47.111 --> 24:48.112
I know she's crazy.

24:48.237 --> 24:49.571
I like crazy.
Hmm.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.282
I'm just making her
sweat it a bit.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.993
Well, you two are
perfect for each other.

24:54.118 --> 24:55.786
There's one other thing,

24:55.911 --> 24:57.371
about the funds
for the charity.

24:57.495 --> 24:58.496
Did you get my check?

24:58.622 --> 25:00.374
Yeah, I did.

25:00.498 --> 25:03.336
But I stopped by the bank
and it bounced.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.006
Oh, I'll (clears throat)
get that cleared up.

25:07.131 --> 25:09.133
Not a problem.

25:09.258 --> 25:11.969
PJ, if there's a problem,
you have to tell me about it.

25:12.094 --> 25:14.347
Yeah, I guess so.

25:14.472 --> 25:15.806
Thank you.

25:18.058 --> 25:20.144
Naomi's right. There's, uh,
there's a bit of a secret.

25:20.269 --> 25:22.396
All right, when I
was 18 and I got

25:22.520 --> 25:25.065
my first installment of my
trust, I went a little crazy.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.733
You know, girls,
booze, partying.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.319
It was like
an orgy 24/7.

25:28.444 --> 25:29.362
Lovely image.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.904
Yeah, it was
a good time.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.614
But my grandfather,
however,

25:32.739 --> 25:34.241
thought I was an embarrassment
to the family name.

25:34.367 --> 25:36.327
So he put a clause
in my trust that said

25:36.452 --> 25:38.704
if I'm not married
by the time I'm 28,

25:38.829 --> 25:41.374
I lose the money, it
goes back to my family.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.334
Wow.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.419
Problem is, I turn
28 in two weeks.

25:45.543 --> 25:46.253
Way to run out the clock.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.671
Well, the way
I figured,

25:47.796 --> 25:50.299
if I wasn't married by
now, I'd find a girl,

25:50.424 --> 25:53.135
get married, and, you
know, doesn't work out,

25:53.260 --> 25:55.513
she gets taken care of
for the rest of her life.

25:55.637 --> 25:58.140
I know it's not very
romantic, but neither was I.

25:58.265 --> 26:01.394
And then I met Naomi.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.396
Wilson, I think
she's the one.

26:03.521 --> 26:05.898
You have to tell her
about this marriage clause.

26:06.023 --> 26:07.691
I can't. I don't
want her to think

26:07.816 --> 26:10.027
that my feelings for
her have anything to do

26:10.152 --> 26:11.529
with the fact that I
could lose everything.

26:11.653 --> 26:12.446
She's gonna find out eventually.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.697
Maybe not.

26:13.822 --> 26:14.698
I have lawyers
working on it,

26:14.823 --> 26:15.866
and there could be
a way around it.

26:15.991 --> 26:16.992
PJ.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.411
Two weeks.
Annie, two weeks.

26:18.536 --> 26:20.496
If I don't have
this figured out,

26:20.620 --> 26:22.373
I promise you I
will tell her.

26:22.498 --> 26:24.582
But you have
to trust me.

26:32.841 --> 26:33.842
Hey.

26:33.967 --> 26:34.885
We're setting up
for the wake.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.136
Annie asked me
to get the blankets.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.472
Ah, yep.
Right here.

26:38.596 --> 26:41.183
Hey, how would you like to,
uh, have another P.A. job?

26:41.308 --> 26:45.812
Because... I just got
the lead in a new film.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.023
Mm. Good for you.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.943
Are you okay?

26:51.068 --> 26:52.945
How could you tell Navid
about the cancer test?

26:53.070 --> 26:54.154
What were you thinking?
What?

26:54.280 --> 26:55.781
We had a huge fight.

26:55.906 --> 26:57.866
Which is exactly
what I didn't want.

26:57.991 --> 26:59.410
Liam, I never should've
trusted you.

26:59.535 --> 27:00.911
Silver, it wasn't me, I swear.

27:01.036 --> 27:02.580
Who else could it have been?

27:06.417 --> 27:08.252
Vanessa.

27:08.377 --> 27:09.253
Why didn't I think of that?

27:09.378 --> 27:10.754
No, she wouldn't do that.

27:10.879 --> 27:11.755
Of course she would.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.215
She hates me.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.762
Liam, I'm sorry.

27:18.887 --> 27:21.599
No, it's-it's fine.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.559
Here. Um, I'll meet you
at the wake.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.673
You must be Haley Reinhart.

28:35.797 --> 28:36.798
Live and almost
in concert.

28:36.923 --> 28:38.217
Did you want
an autograph?

28:38.342 --> 28:41.720
No, I'm actually
looking for Dixon Wilson.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.055
Oh, I think he's
backstage with Carter,

28:43.180 --> 28:44.264
getting ready
for the show.

28:44.390 --> 28:45.516
The show?

28:45.641 --> 28:49.311
Wait, Dixon's
performing today?

28:49.436 --> 28:50.770
With you?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.105
Yeah, I'm-I'm really excited
about it.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.857
Carter played me his single,
I loved it.

28:53.982 --> 28:56.735
Good.

28:56.860 --> 29:00.447
Well, hey, do you want me
to give Dixon a message?

29:00.573 --> 29:03.242
Yeah, actually,
could you tell him

29:03.367 --> 29:06.870
that his girlfriend stopped by?

29:15.421 --> 29:17.339
I'm not really
dressed for this.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.092
Be better when the fire
gets going, but...

29:20.217 --> 29:21.801
Here.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.803
That better?

29:23.929 --> 29:26.515
Yeah. Thanks.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.101
Does this mean we're
going steady now?

29:29.226 --> 29:31.228
Sorry. Bad joke.

29:31.353 --> 29:32.896
I'm gonna get some firewood.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.403
(laughs)

29:39.528 --> 29:40.654
Here's Raj.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.656
Was that a move
or was that a move?

29:42.781 --> 29:44.491
He's just
being friendly.

29:44.617 --> 29:45.784
Oh, would you stop
torturing yourself

29:45.909 --> 29:47.077
and just tell him
how you feel.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.954
But first stop
torturing me, please.

29:49.079 --> 29:50.247
What did PJ say?

29:52.541 --> 29:55.586
Just that... he is fine
with your craziness.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.213
He even kind of likes
it, which is scary.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.215
Thank you!

30:00.340 --> 30:02.050
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

30:02.175 --> 30:03.802
Okay, I really owe you one.

30:03.927 --> 30:05.345
I promise, I am not
going to do anything else

30:05.471 --> 30:07.097
to mess this up,
at all. Okay?

30:07.222 --> 30:08.724
Okay.
Okay.

30:08.848 --> 30:10.058
Okay.

30:10.183 --> 30:11.602
All right.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.813
Ade, please
let me explain.

30:14.938 --> 30:15.939
What is there to explain?

30:16.064 --> 30:17.775
You basically cheated on me.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.234
At least,
that's what it feels like.

30:19.359 --> 30:21.236
But you're the one who said
we should take a break.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.488
Dixon, I'm not stupid, okay?

30:22.613 --> 30:24.030
Why wouldn't you just
tell me in the first place

30:24.156 --> 30:25.198
that you wanted to go solo?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.367
Because I didn't
want to go solo.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.203
(sighs)

30:30.329 --> 30:31.497
The label
asked me to.

30:31.622 --> 30:33.415
All right?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.041
It was after
Desert Valley.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.502
They said no one would
believe that you'd changed.

30:36.627 --> 30:38.086
So what?

30:38.211 --> 30:39.546
We always knew that we would
have to deal with that.

30:41.590 --> 30:43.091
Unless you believed them.

30:43.216 --> 30:46.052
Ade, you know
it's not like that.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.724
I don't know what hurts more,

30:50.849 --> 30:53.352
that you chose your career
over our relationship,

30:53.477 --> 30:55.562
or that you never
really believed in me.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.152
Hey, I know it's almost
time for the wake,

31:02.277 --> 31:04.363
but I think I'm just
gonna stay here.

31:04.488 --> 31:07.907
I've had enough grief
for one weekend.

31:08.033 --> 31:09.618
Did you tell Navid about Silver?

31:11.411 --> 31:12.705
What are you talking about?

31:12.830 --> 31:14.581
Her cancer test.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.500
Someone told him,
and it wasn't me.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.876
And Silver said it was me?

31:18.001 --> 31:18.918
(scoffs)

31:19.044 --> 31:20.713
She's lying.

31:20.838 --> 31:23.507
I don't think so.

31:23.632 --> 31:24.508
Tell me the truth.

31:24.633 --> 31:27.886
How did I get the part
in that movie?

31:28.011 --> 31:29.929
I already told you.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.765
Cynthia was bluffing.
Stop lying to me.

31:31.890 --> 31:34.810
Okay, look, I did some digging,

31:34.934 --> 31:37.646
and I found out that Cynthia
Bennett, married mother of two,

31:37.771 --> 31:40.649
is sleeping with
her boy toy assistant.

31:40.774 --> 31:43.360
So I offered her a trade:
you get the movie,

31:43.485 --> 31:45.070
and she gets to keep
her happy little family.

31:45.195 --> 31:47.781
You blackmailed her?

31:47.906 --> 31:49.282
(wry chuckle)

31:49.408 --> 31:52.285
She insulted your talent.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.788
Look, I'm sorry if
that makes you uncomfortable,

31:54.913 --> 31:57.583
but that's the way
the business works.

31:57.708 --> 31:59.459
Everything I did, I did for you.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.294
Okay? You have
to believe that.

32:01.420 --> 32:04.673
Everything everyone said
about you is true.

32:04.798 --> 32:05.799
Did Adrianna even attack you?

32:05.924 --> 32:07.593
Liam.

32:07.718 --> 32:09.052
The rundown house
you took me to,

32:09.177 --> 32:10.888
did you actually grow up there?
Of course.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.639
The motorcycle accident--
was it actually an accident?

32:15.392 --> 32:16.852
Our relationship has been
one big lie!

32:16.976 --> 32:19.062
Okay, Liam, baby, listen,
you're just talking crazy.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.231
No, no, no. I want you gone
by the time I get back.

32:21.356 --> 32:22.065
You don't mean that.

32:22.190 --> 32:23.650
Oh, yes, I do.

32:23.776 --> 32:25.611
Get your crap
and get the hell out!

32:25.736 --> 32:27.279
Liam, please.

32:27.404 --> 32:30.031
I love you.

32:39.999 --> 32:43.629
We're here tonight
to share our sorrow

32:43.754 --> 32:46.005
and celebrate the life we lost.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.173
There's no rules.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.927
Say what you want to say.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.553
Be honest.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.431
To the dead, we owe
only the truth.

32:54.556 --> 32:55.014
To Raj!

32:55.140 --> 32:57.684
ALL: To Raj.

33:04.817 --> 33:07.152
Raj liked me the best.

33:07.277 --> 33:09.154
I'm serious.

33:09.279 --> 33:12.365
He used to tell me,
"Naomi, you're my favorite."

33:12.491 --> 33:14.952
He let me shave
his head once.

33:15.076 --> 33:17.245
Uh, you know, when his hair
started falling out.

33:17.370 --> 33:18.455
Let's face it-- even bald,

33:18.580 --> 33:21.207
he was one
good-looking Indian dude.

33:21.333 --> 33:22.250
LIAM:
We figured out that his name

33:22.375 --> 33:24.461
spelled backwards was Jar,

33:24.586 --> 33:27.213
and mine spelled backwards
was Mail.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.133
We laughed
for, like, 45 minutes.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.677
And then I was like,

33:31.802 --> 33:32.928
"Dude, seriously,
what is in these brownies?"

33:33.052 --> 33:35.180
(laughter)

33:35.305 --> 33:37.724
The guy was a good listener,
you know?

33:37.850 --> 33:40.018
It's like, I'd be complaining
about something stupid,

33:40.143 --> 33:43.897
then remember that he just went
through a full day of chemo.

33:44.022 --> 33:47.317
(chuckles)

33:47.442 --> 33:50.278
Kind of makes me wish, uh...

33:50.403 --> 33:52.489
I would've listened
to him a little more.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.199
ADRIANNA:
He didn't care about your past

33:54.324 --> 33:56.827
or the mistakes you made.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.705
He just took you at face value.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.791
He never felt sorry for himself.

34:02.916 --> 34:05.084
Even when the cancer
was taking its toll.

34:05.210 --> 34:08.547
He was... positive.

34:08.672 --> 34:10.340
NAOMI:
I'll never forget the wedding.

34:10.465 --> 34:12.257
How he looked at Ivy

34:12.384 --> 34:16.094
as he stood across
from her at the altar.

34:16.221 --> 34:18.431
I don't know--
it gave me the hope that...

34:18.556 --> 34:20.308
someday someone
could look at me like that.

34:20.433 --> 34:24.187
ANNIE: There was something
about the way he said good-bye.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.524
He'd look you straight
in the eye, almost like he knew

34:27.649 --> 34:29.985
it could be the last time,
so he wanted

34:30.109 --> 34:32.946
to let you know how important
you were to him.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.657
Anybody else?

34:40.286 --> 34:42.039
Wait.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.581
Okay, I know
you guys

34:43.706 --> 34:48.293
are all saying these
really nice things about Raj,

34:48.420 --> 34:51.339
okay, but the truth is, I mean,
Raj was just a liar.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.174
He lied to me,
and he told me

34:53.299 --> 34:55.552
that he didn't
love me anymore.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.888
And I know that he thought
that he was protecting me,

34:58.013 --> 35:01.224
but we were... we were supposed
to be together until the end.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.393
I mean, I married him
so that I could spend

35:03.518 --> 35:05.478
the rest of his life with him.

35:05.604 --> 35:09.482
And then he just took
that away from me.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.650
And now this is
what I'm left with.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.694
The time that we could
have spent together.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.405
And the conversations
that we could have had.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.199
And the things
that I never said.

35:18.324 --> 35:21.078
I can't get
that back.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.080
I deserved more.

35:23.204 --> 35:25.624
There should have been more.

35:39.471 --> 35:42.348
Think she's
going to be okay?

35:43.976 --> 35:45.727
Yeah.

35:45.852 --> 35:46.812
She stopped trying to
hide from her feelings

35:46.937 --> 35:50.565
and was finally honest
about what a loss this is.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.567
The truth
will always set you free.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.947
Are you okay?

35:57.072 --> 36:00.366
No, not really.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.912
I haven't exactly been honest
with a friend of mine.

36:04.037 --> 36:07.332
And I guess I'm just worried
that if I tell the truth,

36:07.457 --> 36:10.168
it could change
our relationship forever.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.087
Well, in my experience,
if people are talking

36:12.211 --> 36:13.839
to me about it, it's because
they've already decided

36:13.964 --> 36:15.173
they want to tell the truth.

36:17.801 --> 36:19.678
You're right.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.972
I should just be honest.

36:26.018 --> 36:27.936
I'm pretty tired.

36:28.061 --> 36:30.438
I should probably get home
and get some sleep.

36:30.563 --> 36:31.606
I'll see you later, okay?

36:37.487 --> 36:40.323
I'm sorry for
calling you selfish.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.993
I was way
out of line.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.620
Just, hearing
Ivy tonight and...

36:48.665 --> 36:50.876
I can't stand the
thought of losing you.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.714
You were right,
you know.
