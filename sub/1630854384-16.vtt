[Male narrator]
<i>Previously on Sistas.</i>

00:01.968 --> 00:03.370
-Maurice Webb.
-Okay what do you need?.

00:03.370 --> 00:04.637
Help me get bail for him.

00:04.637 --> 00:06.740
Andi, I do not have another
million dollars.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.275
-Andi told Robin about the call.
-He already knows, right?

00:09.275 --> 00:10.677
I think he may have a way out.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.812
He is so leveraged, there ain't
no way, I'm telling you.

00:12.812 --> 00:15.515
I'm on my way to Andi's office
right now to figure it out.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.084
Well hurry up, I'm in here
fighting for my virginity.

00:18.084 --> 00:20.353
-I just want you.
-[Fatima]<i> How was your night?</i>

00:20.353 --> 00:23.189
I got him, girl.
He is eating out of my hands.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.892
You and Zac, you're good, right?

00:25.892 --> 00:28.128
-What is it?
-Are they kissing?

00:28.461 --> 00:29.629
What the--

00:32.157 --> 00:35.761
-Is that him?
-Send me that picture.

00:36.228 --> 00:40.699
-Okay. Is that him?
-Yeah, that's him.

00:44.036 --> 00:45.304
Shit.

00:46.038 --> 00:48.073
Girl, I did not
wanna show you this.

00:52.244 --> 00:54.179
How did you get
that picture anyway?

00:55.314 --> 00:57.850
Well, um, a friend of mine,
she was at the salon,

00:58.317 --> 01:02.688
she recognized him and she knows
I know you so she sent it to me.

01:07.025 --> 01:10.028
At the salon. Is she legit?

01:11.163 --> 01:13.766
-What do you mean?
-Is she a shit starter?

01:14.967 --> 01:19.605
No, I mean, she just knows that
I know you, and she asked me if

01:19.605 --> 01:21.573
this was the guy
my friend was dating.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.311
Okay, I'm just, I'm just
trying to figure out why

01:26.311 --> 01:27.713
she would send you that picture.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.783
Fatima, don't you think
you should be

01:30.783 --> 01:33.419
a little bit more concerned with
why he's kissing her?

01:34.553 --> 01:37.356
I got that, but still,
I need to check the source.

01:38.056 --> 01:41.293
-I see.
-Damn.

01:42.494 --> 01:45.831
Well, look, maybe it's
an old picture.

01:47.933 --> 01:51.837
-Zac had that on today.
-Damn.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.640
And his ass couldn't afford it
in the past.

01:55.908 --> 01:57.109
[Angela]<i> </i>Hmmm.

02:00.112 --> 02:03.649
Maybe he has a twin or
something.

02:03.649 --> 02:05.784
A twin, bitch? Really?

02:08.654 --> 02:13.792
Look, I, I appreciate it,
but that's him.

02:15.060 --> 02:16.295
-[Angela]<i> </i>Hmmm.

02:19.131 --> 02:21.133
Girl, what you gonna do?

02:23.936 --> 02:25.204
I'm just gonna wait.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.808
-Wait for what?
-For him to tell me.

02:32.077 --> 02:35.314
-Shit.
-What?

02:35.914 --> 02:39.618
Um, that's just real new
for you.

02:40.252 --> 02:41.620
And what do you mean by that?

02:42.287 --> 02:45.524
I mean, back in college,
you would've been in that ass.

02:46.758 --> 02:50.329
Well honey, I am in my 30's
and I'm not doing all that.

02:50.662 --> 02:51.997
Alright, alright.

02:51.997 --> 02:54.199
So I'm just gonna
let him tell me.

02:56.602 --> 02:57.803
Alright.

02:58.670 --> 02:59.605
Well, why not?

03:00.472 --> 03:04.576
Because the longer you wait,
the more angry you get.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.450
I know, but let's just see
what he does.

03:12.251 --> 03:14.119
No, no, I don't like that,

03:14.119 --> 03:16.321
you need to just call him
and ask him.

03:17.556 --> 03:18.624
Angela, no.

03:19.157 --> 03:22.227
Look, I want to look him in his
eyes when he tells me this.

03:23.729 --> 03:24.696
Are you sure?

03:30.402 --> 03:33.605
Yes. Okay? I'm sure.

03:36.341 --> 03:40.078
Okay, well,
you know I heard that

03:40.078 --> 03:41.480
they be having sex
in that back room.

03:41.480 --> 03:45.384
Really? Don't-- Don't you need
to get back upstairs?

03:47.653 --> 03:49.154
-Oh.
-Think it's about time.

03:49.154 --> 03:50.255
-[Angela] Okay.
-Yeah.

03:50.255 --> 03:51.990
-[Angela] You right.
-Thank you.

03:51.990 --> 03:55.594
-Look, I'm really sorry.
-You know what? It's all good.

03:56.495 --> 03:58.363
-Okay.
-It's all good.

03:58.630 --> 03:59.598

-Hi.

Uh yeah, she's actually
in her office,

04:44.368 --> 04:46.370
one of the bosses just
went in to talk to her.

04:47.905 --> 04:49.473
Oh, okay.

just come back with me,

[knocking]
Come in.

05:11.028 --> 05:12.396
-Hey.
-[Andi] Hi.

05:14.332 --> 05:17.702
-So I talked to him.
-Okay, is it gonna work out?

05:18.970 --> 05:20.938
He wants 20% interest.

05:23.941 --> 05:26.844
-What?
-Yeah.

05:30.114 --> 05:32.249
Well, it's either that
or you lose the--

05:32.750 --> 05:34.719
-Not gonna do that.
-[Andi]<i> </i>Mhmmm.

05:35.753 --> 05:38.889
So, um, when are they gonna send
you the money?

05:39.590 --> 05:43.294
-Oh, they already wired it.
-You move quick.

05:44.362 --> 05:46.897
He wasn't big on a contract.

05:49.967 --> 05:52.903
Mm-mm, he just likes to get his
money back. [laughs]

05:52.903 --> 05:53.838
I got that part.

05:56.707 --> 05:59.677
Okay, well, I'm glad that
they're not taking over.

06:02.279 --> 06:03.481
Yeah, I wanna see their faces

06:03.481 --> 06:04.949
when they find out
I put the money up.

06:07.418 --> 06:08.552
And when will that be?

06:09.387 --> 06:10.888
Called them here
for a meeting tomorrow.

06:11.422 --> 06:14.992
-Hmmm, well, good.
-Yeah.

06:17.662 --> 06:18.763
Okay.

06:23.901 --> 06:25.269
Can I see you tonight?

06:33.444 --> 06:35.546
I'm sorry, Robin, but no.

06:38.749 --> 06:40.651
[sighs] It was worth a shot,
right?

06:43.054 --> 06:46.390
Thank you for taking a shot.
Shooters shoot.

06:46.390 --> 06:49.960
-Shooters shoot?
-[laughs]

06:52.797 --> 06:53.864
You don't miss me?

06:57.868 --> 07:01.505
To be honest? No.

07:03.574 --> 07:04.875
-[Andi] I'm joking.
-Damn.

07:04.875 --> 07:07.178
-[laughter]
-I'm joking, of course.

07:07.812 --> 07:10.948

enjoyed your company.

07:13.484 --> 07:16.887
-But you and Gary...
-We're not together.

07:18.889 --> 07:20.925
-[Robin]<i> </i>But you're...
-He's around.

07:23.260 --> 07:24.462
I see.

07:25.796 --> 07:29.333
I have to get back to work so--

07:30.067 --> 07:31.001

07:32.870 --> 07:34.972

-Hi.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.640

07:36.640 --> 07:38.142
Oh yes, could you please
bring her in?

to call me back.

07:46.317 --> 07:50.387
-Okay, thank you.
-Yeah. Hey.

07:51.155 --> 07:52.423

08:03.067 --> 08:06.704
Oh! [laughs] I'm sorry.
Let me get that off of you.

08:06.704 --> 08:09.106
-You guys need anything?
-No, we're fine, thank you.

08:09.106 --> 08:10.274
-Okay, uh-huh.
-I missed you.

08:10.274 --> 08:11.776
I missed you too,
glad you're back.

08:12.143 --> 08:16.714
-Andi, oh my God.
-Okay.

08:18.616 --> 08:21.352
Alright, just relax, okay?

08:21.352 --> 08:22.987
I'm doing everything I can
for Maurice.

08:24.321 --> 08:27.858
-I know, but...
-What is it?

08:29.593 --> 08:34.532
-I told him to call me.
-Really?

08:35.399 --> 08:37.234
There's nothing I can do
about it right now,

08:37.234 --> 08:38.169
I mean, I'm at work.

08:39.637 --> 08:41.839
Well, at least he'll know that
somebody is trying.

08:43.874 --> 08:47.144
Okay, I mean, do I really
have a choice?

08:49.380 --> 08:52.750
-This is insane.
-I know.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.623
I just, I, I just don't want him
to do anything stupid, you know?

09:01.392 --> 09:02.593
Like what?

09:08.766 --> 09:11.001
Sabrina, is Maurice suicidal?

09:15.339 --> 09:18.008
No, but he does not like it
in there.

09:18.943 --> 09:23.547
-I can only imagine.
-No, you can't, Andi.

09:24.682 --> 09:29.553
-This is traumatizing.
-I'm sorry.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.957
[phone buzzing]

09:32.957 --> 09:35.326
This is him calling.

-[Andi]<i> How are you?</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:05.222
-Oh, I'm in paradise, ho.
-Okay, Maurice.

10:05.656 --> 10:07.892
Why would you ask
some fool shit like that?

10:08.759 --> 10:12.029
-Maurice.
-What? Shit.

10:13.797 --> 10:15.933
-This is not helping.
-Mm-mm.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.569
Well I'm not being helped.

10:19.937 --> 10:23.407
-Maurice, she's trying.
-Well she better do something.

10:24.008 --> 10:27.344
My boss put a call in to the
judge to see if we can set bail.

10:27.811 --> 10:29.780
-Bail?
-[Andi]<i> Yeah.</i>

10:30.381 --> 10:31.649
He helped with Sabrina.

10:32.850 --> 10:35.920
Okay, well, well how much was
Sabrina's bail?

10:37.855 --> 10:39.256
Don't worry about that, Maurice.

10:39.790 --> 10:42.026
I will let you know
more information

10:42.393 --> 10:44.061
about if your bail gets set.

10:44.628 --> 10:48.766
[sighs] I don't have any money.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.635
We're gonna do everything
that we can, okay?

10:52.469 --> 10:56.740
Listen, I don't think that bail,
Andi, is a good idea for me.

10:57.374 --> 11:00.844
Well, you go to a bails bondsman
and they lend you the money.

11:01.312 --> 11:06.016
Oh look at that, another stupid
idea that requires money!

11:07.151 --> 11:10.254
-We are working on that.
-Y'all better do something.

11:11.221 --> 11:13.657
-We are trying, Maurice.
-No, Maurice, hold on.

-[Sabrina]<i> </i>Andi.
-No!

11:16.593 --> 11:21.098
Okay? Now Sabrina is doing this
because she cares about you.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.133
I'm doing this because I care
about Sabrina.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.234

-[Andi] No.

11:25.069 --> 11:27.671
<i>Sabrina is your friend.

11:28.939 --> 11:32.276

anything, to be clear.

-No, so all this

-I, I really am sorry.

-It's okay.
-[Maurice]<i> No it's all my fault.</i>

11:59.737 --> 12:01.372
Maurice, please, don't do that.

12:01.839 --> 12:04.875
I let him stay here,
but okay, okay.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.979
-Maurice.
-Okay.

12:10.914 --> 12:13.851
We're gonna,
we're gonna get you out.

12:15.252 --> 12:17.588
-Yeah.
-Okay, please.

12:18.255 --> 12:20.357
Okay, we're gonna do everything
that we can, okay?

12:21.392 --> 12:24.128
-Thank you so much.
-[Sabrina]<i> Call me later?</i>

12:24.828 --> 12:26.163
I will if I can.

12:27.464 --> 12:31.702
-Okay, be safe.
-Andi? Thank you.

12:33.437 --> 12:36.273
-Bye, Maurice.
-Okay, bye-bye.

12:37.074 --> 12:38.075
Bye.

12:39.943 --> 12:41.111
Did you have to do that?

12:41.111 --> 12:43.580
Yeah, he needs to know
the truth.

12:43.947 --> 12:46.250
He's the reason why
you're in this mess.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.352
I know, but he's already
so down on himself.

12:48.352 --> 12:49.453
No, I am sorry, Sabrina,

12:50.187 --> 12:54.091
but I have been doing favors
left and right, expensive ones.

12:54.091 --> 12:55.025
For you.

12:58.062 --> 13:01.031
Okay? I don't, I don't need
all that attitude from him.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.102
-You're right.
-[Andi]<i> </i>Mhmmm.

13:05.736 --> 13:07.805
-Okay, I understand.
-Okay.

13:09.173 --> 13:13.210
Well, do you think they're gonna
give him bail?

13:16.914 --> 13:18.882
Sabrina, do you know how much
your bail was?

13:20.551 --> 13:25.289
-No.
-Millions of dollars.

13:28.459 --> 13:31.962
-What?
-No bond, cash only.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.903
-How did--
-I gave them everything I had.

13:44.641 --> 13:46.210
And Robin helped me
with the rest.

13:50.781 --> 13:53.183
And from what I can assess
with this prosecutor,

13:53.183 --> 13:55.953
they are going to do
the same thing for Maurice.

14:01.158 --> 14:04.862
-Thank you, thank you.
-I love you.

14:04.862 --> 14:06.964
-I love you.
-[Andi]<i> </i>There's no question.

14:08.198 --> 14:10.934
But it is not looking good
for Maurice, okay?

14:13.237 --> 14:17.207
-I understand.
-If the judge comes back

14:17.207 --> 14:20.511
and says he wants another
multi-million cash bond,

14:22.146 --> 14:23.881
I don't know what else I can do.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.221
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

14:32.422 --> 14:35.325
I understand, I really
appreciate everything.

14:36.326 --> 14:40.397
That's fine. You go home, I'll
let you know what they say.

14:42.032 --> 14:43.767
-Okay, thank you.
-I love you.

14:43.767 --> 14:44.902
I love you.

14:51.909 --> 14:54.511
Sabrina, I am doing
everything I can, okay?

14:54.511 --> 14:56.046
-Alright.
-Thank you.

14:59.449 --> 15:00.751
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

15:00.751 --> 15:01.885
Okay.

15:09.760 --> 15:13.397
[phone buzzing]

15:14.498 --> 15:16.000
-[Hayden]<i> Hey.
</i>-Hey man.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.502
-[Hayden]<i> How you doing?
</i>-I'm good.

15:19.436 --> 15:22.940
-Bet you ain't as good as me.
-What are you talking about?

15:24.775 --> 15:28.245
-I found the one, bro.
-Yeah?

15:28.712 --> 15:30.948
I am telling you,
this woman, ooh.

15:30.948 --> 15:33.317
-[Gary]<i> The one you just met?
</i>-Oh yeah, she the one.

15:35.786 --> 15:37.054
Hayden, what are you--
What's going on?

15:37.454 --> 15:41.125
I'm telling you,
this girl is next level, I mean,

15:41.992 --> 15:43.594
the stuff that
she was doing to me...

15:44.194 --> 15:48.499
-What?
-I was like, my God.

15:49.099 --> 15:51.335
Like, I didn't even know it was
like that, for real.

15:51.869 --> 15:54.171
Uh, she the one. [laughs]

15:55.806 --> 15:57.374
Alright, did you call me
to talk about her

15:57.374 --> 15:58.809
or did you call me to
talk about business?

15:59.476 --> 16:01.312
[Hayden]<i> So you just wanna talk
about your shit, huh?</i>

16:02.446 --> 16:06.350
Alright, well, the real reason I
called is about Andi.

16:07.451 --> 16:08.352
What about her?

16:09.853 --> 16:11.455
I saw her in the office with
your boy.

16:11.789 --> 16:12.890
Look I, I don't care, man.

16:13.624 --> 16:16.026
You don't care that she was
in the office with Robin?

16:16.627 --> 16:17.828
No, I do not.

16:19.096 --> 16:20.965
'Cause we about to
take his ass out, huh?

16:22.499 --> 16:23.400
That's right.

16:24.101 --> 16:26.837
Man, I am loving that shit,
you don't even know.

16:28.439 --> 16:31.909
-Yeah, me too.
-You think Andi told him?

16:36.146 --> 16:41.385
-You know, I hope she did.
-Why?

16:41.986 --> 16:43.887
Um, well, that way
he knows it's me.

16:46.190 --> 16:49.860
-I don't know, man.
-Hayden, what's the problem?

16:50.394 --> 16:52.296
It's not like the man
can come up with the money.

16:53.063 --> 16:53.998
I know that, but...

16:54.431 --> 16:56.333
Oh, and hey,
do you know he called?

16:57.701 --> 16:59.403
-Wait, what?
-Yeah, yeah,

16:59.403 --> 17:01.572
he wants to meet with me
and your, uh, client tomorrow.

17:02.940 --> 17:05.309
Really? Well, that's good.

17:06.744 --> 17:09.213
Yeah, yeah, he probably
wants to tell us

17:09.213 --> 17:10.414
he doesn't have the money.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.284
I can't wait to see the look on
his dumbass face.

17:15.119 --> 17:19.023
-Yeah, me too.
-Don't -- with Gary, huh?

17:20.290 --> 17:22.626
That's right, don't -- with
what's mine.

17:23.193 --> 17:26.563
Mhmmm, hey, don't mess with
mines either, though.

17:27.431 --> 17:28.632
[chuckles] That's right, yeah.

17:30.134 --> 17:32.002
Hold up, Hayden,
what are you talking about?

17:32.002 --> 17:33.370
Fatima, what you think?

17:34.905 --> 17:39.009
-Come on, man.
-No look, so I got this guy,

17:39.009 --> 17:41.145
and he's been watching
his every move, right?

17:41.712 --> 17:45.115
-This Zac stuff again?
-[Hayden]<i> So it turns out</i>

17:45.115 --> 17:47.785
this -- got a baby mama,
of course, right?

17:47.785 --> 17:52.189
So I'm taking his ass to court.
That boy getting sued for sure.

17:55.626 --> 17:56.660
What's wrong with you?

17:58.095 --> 17:59.430
I got this man,
what's the problem?

17:59.863 --> 18:01.598
Look, you can't be acting
like this, man,

18:01.598 --> 18:02.566
over a woman? Come on.

18:04.034 --> 18:07.905
Okay, you realize
we two peas in a pod, right?

18:08.605 --> 18:11.809
No, no, no, no, no, Hayden.
We are nothing alike.

18:11.809 --> 18:16.146
No? You are literally forcing
a man out of his own company

18:16.447 --> 18:17.347
over a woman.

18:18.615 --> 18:22.453
This is a level up, alright?
Not jealousy.

18:24.054 --> 18:25.756
That's a level up,
yeah, okay, bro.

18:26.223 --> 18:27.424
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, alright?

18:27.825 --> 18:29.093
It's the truth.

18:30.094 --> 18:34.264
-[Hayden]<i> Alright.
</i>-Alright, I gotta go.

18:35.299 --> 18:37.768
-Alright, bro.
-I'll talk to you later, man.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.303
-[Hayden]<i> Mhmmm.
</i>-Alright.

18:40.270 --> 18:43.507
Me and you the same. Hayden.

18:54.084 --> 18:56.587
-Alright.
-What?

18:56.587 --> 19:00.190
-It's time for you to go home.
-I am not going home.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.091
Oh, yes, you are.

19:01.859 --> 19:03.494
You know you only supposed to
be working half days.

19:03.827 --> 19:06.163
-I'm fine.
-[Pam] No, you ain't.

19:06.463 --> 19:07.631
Yes, I am, Pam.

19:08.098 --> 19:10.601
Karen Mott, don't make me
call your mama.

19:13.403 --> 19:16.573
-You don't have to.
-Well, hey, Aaron.

19:16.573 --> 19:17.474
What's up, Pam?

19:17.775 --> 19:19.610
You know, you be popping up like

19:19.610 --> 19:22.312
one of those little talking
devils on your shoulder.

19:22.312 --> 19:24.648
-Uh-uh, don't say that.
-[Pam]<i> </i>Well, you do.

19:26.283 --> 19:28.152
-Hey, Karen.
-Hey.

19:28.952 --> 19:29.820
It's time to go.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.791
Oh, I can't leave Pam here
by herself, you know.

19:33.791 --> 19:34.758
Oh, yes, you can.

19:35.893 --> 19:38.328
Do I need to tell him about
you and them curling irons?

19:40.731 --> 19:43.967
-That was one time.
-It only takes one time, Pam

19:44.501 --> 19:45.903
I know, that's why
we send you the video

19:45.903 --> 19:47.437
of me cutting everything off.

19:48.705 --> 19:52.242
-See? She got it.
-What does she got? Tell me.

19:53.277 --> 19:54.812
Hello, tell her, Aaron.

19:54.812 --> 19:56.146
Look, I wanna take you
to dinner.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.549
-Is that so?
-Yes.

20:00.083 --> 20:03.520
-Okay, where to?
-You name the place.

20:04.888 --> 20:06.890
-Okay.
-Alright, we have spent

20:06.890 --> 20:08.258
too much time in that apartment.

20:09.726 --> 20:10.994
Yeah, we have.

20:10.994 --> 20:12.796
Yes, and I'm gonna get you
a nice big meal.

20:12.796 --> 20:13.997
-Oh will you?
-Mhmmm.

20:14.364 --> 20:16.033
Yeah, we gotta feed this baby.

20:16.667 --> 20:19.369
Okay, there's people around,
okay.

20:20.571 --> 20:22.940
-They don't mind. Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:23.407 --> 20:25.242
So you ready to go, or?

20:25.242 --> 20:27.110
Yeah, let me just get my things.

20:27.110 --> 20:28.579
-Okay.
-Oh, that's okay with you?

20:28.579 --> 20:30.113
-Yeah, that's fine with me.
-Okay.

20:30.113 --> 20:31.548
-Yeah, please, by all means.
-Oh okay, perfect.

20:31.548 --> 20:33.283
No, yeah 'cause so I can
whisk you away, thank you.

20:33.283 --> 20:36.220
-Excuse me.
-Yes please, thank you.

20:40.691 --> 20:42.659
-Can you get her up outta here?
-[Aaron] I'm getting her.

20:42.659 --> 20:45.896
'Cause let me tell you,
she's working my last nerve.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.231
You know she can hear you,
right?

20:47.231 --> 20:50.500
-I know.
-Alright, you better be quiet.

20:52.302 --> 20:53.470
She'll be alright.

20:56.673 --> 20:58.375
How many things
does she have to get?

20:58.976 --> 21:00.677
Alright. [sighs]

21:04.047 --> 21:07.184
[phone buzzing]

21:08.185 --> 21:10.520
-Hello?
-Hey, I uh,

21:10.520 --> 21:13.290
wanted to bring over these
papers that Zac dropped off.

21:14.291 --> 21:17.294
-He's got it ready already?
-Yes, he did.

21:17.294 --> 21:19.463
Okay, well, um,
bring it to my house tonight.

21:20.030 --> 21:23.934
Okay, um, Aaron's bringing me to
dinner, so I can come by after.

21:24.434 --> 21:27.671
-Okay, that's fine.
-[Karen]<i> Maybe like 9 o'clock?</i>

21:27.671 --> 21:29.873
-Perfect.
-Alright, see you then.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.175
[chuckles] See you then.

21:36.633 --> 21:38.368
-Fatima?
-Hey.

21:38.368 --> 21:42.338
-What are you doing?
-What, did I miss something?

21:42.839 --> 21:45.175
Look at your phone, where is it?
See?

21:46.409 --> 21:47.844
-Oh, shit!
-Yes.

21:48.278 --> 21:51.514
-Andi I'm, I'm so--
-I called you several times.

21:51.514 --> 21:55.585
-I'm sorry, um... Sorry.
-What's going on?

21:56.986 --> 21:57.921
Nothing.

22:00.824 --> 22:03.259
I know you. What's up?

22:07.030 --> 22:08.164
It's nothing.

22:10.533 --> 22:14.104
Well, uh, looks like Zac has his

22:14.104 --> 22:16.239
child support paperwork
in order.

22:17.407 --> 22:20.977
Yeah, um, he went to go see
the lawyer today.

22:23.146 --> 22:27.917
-Karen wants me to look over it.
-Okay, that's good.

22:31.221 --> 22:36.226
So are we all moving forward
with this?

22:38.561 --> 22:44.000
Yeah, moving forward with this
what you wanna call it.

22:46.202 --> 22:47.904
Fatima, what's going on?

22:51.307 --> 22:56.246
Andi, if I tell you this, you
cannot say anything to Karen.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.916
-Oh gosh.
-[Fatima] Andi, promise me.

23:02.418 --> 23:05.221
I promise. Now what is it?

23:11.161 --> 23:15.498
-Are-- Are you looking at it?
-It's clearly an old photo.

23:16.299 --> 23:19.936
No, it's not.
He had this on today.

23:21.204 --> 23:24.007
Oh, and...

23:24.007 --> 23:27.277
Yeah, when he took the papers,
this is what happened.

23:29.045 --> 23:33.783
Okay, well, did you call him
and talk to him about it?

23:34.817 --> 23:39.322
-No, I didn't.
-You should.

23:40.557 --> 23:42.358
No, I want him to tell me.

23:43.359 --> 23:45.261
And you know what's really
pissing me off?

23:46.129 --> 23:46.896
What?

23:47.230 --> 23:49.365
I ain't heard from this --
all day.

23:52.702 --> 23:55.605
-Okay.
-Nah, Andi.

23:56.072 --> 23:57.373
That's that guilt shit.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.409
This -- would've been
text me or call me.

23:59.409 --> 24:03.780
No, you don't know that, let's
just, let's just, let's just...

24:06.449 --> 24:08.718
Okay, first, who took the photo?

24:09.219 --> 24:11.087
Look, I already went
down that path,

24:11.087 --> 24:13.656
and it's not Karen,
from what I know.

24:14.090 --> 24:15.892
No, she wouldn't do
anything like that.

24:17.260 --> 24:18.161
Are you sure?

24:19.195 --> 24:21.998
I've known Karen for years, she
does not play those kinda games.

24:24.934 --> 24:27.403
Great, so that means
this is real.

24:28.204 --> 24:30.306
It can't be real, let me see it
one more time.

24:30.607 --> 24:32.242
No Andi, this is real.

24:35.645 --> 24:41.317
Well, okay.
Go home, talk to your man.

24:41.317 --> 24:43.720
-No.
-[Andi] Talk to your man, yes.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.888
Go home, talk to him,
talk to Zac.

24:49.759 --> 24:51.227
-Okay.
-[Andi] Yes.

24:51.995 --> 24:54.097
-Alright.
-You okay?

-Just talk to your man.

24:59.035 --> 25:01.304
-And call me.

-Hi.
-Hi.

25:15.785 --> 25:16.953

-Yeah, of course.

25:16.953 --> 25:18.121

-Okay.

25:18.121 --> 25:19.088
-[Fatima] Bye.
-[Robin]<i> </i>Bye.

25:21.090 --> 25:23.159
So I've got
good news and bad news.

25:25.461 --> 25:28.064
-Okay.
-Maurice got bail.

25:29.098 --> 25:33.536
-Wow, thank you.
-Same situation, cash.

25:34.671 --> 25:37.540
-What?
-1.5.

25:38.941 --> 25:40.310
What in the hell?

25:40.310 --> 25:42.011
What in the hell did you do
to this prosecutor?

25:42.378 --> 25:44.380
I promise I didn't do anything,
I mean...

25:44.881 --> 25:47.550
-Well, you had to do something.
-I mean, I did beat the breaks

25:47.550 --> 25:50.286
off of him in a divorce case,
but that's it, I mean...

25:50.286 --> 25:52.555
That's right, that's right.
I mean, that'll do it.

25:52.555 --> 25:57.593
-It will. [laughs]
-So yeah, good and not so good.

25:58.227 --> 25:59.162
Right.

26:02.198 --> 26:04.167
I'd really love
to take you to dinner tonight.

26:08.905 --> 26:11.341
-No.
-[sighs]

26:12.275 --> 26:14.210
So I'm never gonna get to
make this up to you?

26:14.210 --> 26:15.144
No.

26:18.348 --> 26:21.050
-So when you been burned...
-I'm out.

26:22.919 --> 26:27.423

26:28.958 --> 26:30.093
Thank you again.

26:31.427 --> 26:32.895
Yeah, let me know if you need
anything else.

26:33.196 --> 26:35.998
Uh, you've done
more than enough.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.501
And yet I still can't
take you out?

26:42.171 --> 26:45.808
-Okay, I get it.
-Thanks for getting it.

26:46.109 --> 26:47.677
-[Robin] Yeah.
-Okay.

26:47.677 --> 26:51.447
[music]

27:09.474 --> 27:13.312
[phone buzzing]

27:13.645 --> 27:15.881
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:17.849 --> 27:21.920
-Well?
-I was able to get him bail.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.389
-Oh my God, thank God, what?
-[Andi]<i> Hold on.</i>

27:24.389 --> 27:28.927
-What?
-It's 1.5 million dollars.

27:31.863 --> 27:37.169
What? Oh my God, oh my God.

27:37.736 --> 27:39.004
How am I gonna get that?

27:39.671 --> 27:42.474
It's cash only, and
you know I'm tapped out.

27:44.576 --> 27:47.279
[sighs] I don't even know
what to do with that.

27:48.013 --> 27:49.181
I'm sorry.

27:50.182 --> 27:52.084
You know I don't know anybody
with that kinda cash flow.

27:52.484 --> 27:56.488
-Yeah, I know.
-Do you have any more money?

27:57.556 --> 28:02.461
Sabrina, I spent all my money
on your bail, so no.

28:04.496 --> 28:05.497
Right, right.

28:06.431 --> 28:08.500
And you're not gonna skip town,
right?

28:08.500 --> 28:11.336
[sighs] Andi, I won't.

28:11.336 --> 28:15.507
Okay, good. I knew that,
I knew you were a safe bet.

28:16.308 --> 28:20.612
Yeah. I know I have
about $87,000.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.081
Friend, that's not
gonna be enough.

28:23.849 --> 28:28.720
I know that, Andi.
What about Karen?

28:29.688 --> 28:32.224
You know Karen doesn't have
that kind of money.

28:35.160 --> 28:36.361
What about Zac?

28:37.295 --> 28:41.033
How is Zac even an option
for this situation?

28:43.635 --> 28:49.107
Well, I think I might know
one other person.

28:50.675 --> 28:51.643
Well, who is it?

28:54.179 --> 28:56.748
Nevermind, uh, I'm gonna,
I'm gonna ask him.

28:58.350 --> 29:01.853
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.591
Okay, and you're sure that
Maurice isn't gonna run?

29:07.659 --> 29:08.593
He won't.

29:09.861 --> 29:13.131
-Are you sure?
-Andi, I'm sure.

29:13.698 --> 29:15.700
Okay, suit yourself.

29:16.668 --> 29:19.204
[sighs] Alright, let me just go
ahead and call this person.

29:19.671 --> 29:22.274
Okay, um, give me a call
when you get the money

29:22.274 --> 29:24.309
-and I will get him out.
-Okay.

29:24.643 --> 29:30.348
-Okay, um, are you okay?
-[sighs] I will be.

29:30.348 --> 29:33.919
Alright, good.
I'll call you later.

29:33.919 --> 29:35.654
-Thank you, Andi.
-[Andi]<i> Alright.</i>

29:35.921 --> 29:37.022
Bye.

29:52.871 --> 29:54.706
-Bayo.
-[Bayo]<i> Sabrina.</i>

29:55.340 --> 29:59.411
-Hi, how are you?
-[Bayo]<i> I'm good.</i>

30:00.745 --> 30:02.080
Good.

30:02.080 --> 30:03.348
[Bayo]
<i>I would really like to see you.</i>

30:06.518 --> 30:08.787
Could you please come over,
then? Now?

30:09.488 --> 30:11.289
[Bayo]
<i>Sure, I will head right over.</i>

30:12.124 --> 30:16.328
-Okay, I'll see you in a bit.
-[Bayo]<i> Is everything okay?</i>

30:18.630 --> 30:20.632
I will tell you everything
when you get here.

30:21.099 --> 30:23.969
-[Bayo]<i> Okay.
</i>-Okay, see you soon.

30:24.402 --> 30:26.338
-[Bayo]<i> I'm on my way.
</i>-Bye.

30:37.382 --> 30:40.585
-Hey, you leaving?
-Yeah.

30:41.453 --> 30:43.488
So uh, can I come over?

30:44.756 --> 30:49.227
No, I don't let men I don't know
come to my house.

30:49.227 --> 30:50.362
But you know me, though.

30:51.396 --> 30:53.165
No, I don't know you.

30:53.498 --> 30:55.700
I mean, we've been working here
every day.

30:55.700 --> 30:57.936
-No.
-[Que] Really?

30:58.470 --> 31:01.640
Well shit, what I'm gonna do to
you? I'm being monitored.

31:02.674 --> 31:04.876
-I'm sorry, Quincy.
-[Que] Really?

31:05.443 --> 31:08.380
Can I at least, you know,
ask you to drop me off?

31:10.549 --> 31:12.617
What, what, what do I look like
to you?

31:12.884 --> 31:13.852
[Que] Come on, Danni.

31:15.353 --> 31:17.589
Okay, where?
Where, where do you...

31:17.889 --> 31:18.857
At the train station.

31:20.525 --> 31:26.364
Oh, it's upstairs, it literally
leaves from the airport.

31:26.364 --> 31:28.133
Uh-huh, you see, I was just
trying to...

31:28.133 --> 31:30.202
-Lie.
-Okay, look.

31:30.202 --> 31:32.404
-[Danni]<i> </i>Mhmmm.
-Just trying to get to know you.

31:34.372 --> 31:36.174
-And I got some good--
-[Danni]<i> </i>What?

31:36.174 --> 31:37.542
I got some good weed.

31:39.244 --> 31:41.246
You think I'm gonna
smoke weed from you?

31:41.246 --> 31:43.415
Shit's probably laced with
fentanyl, no.

31:43.415 --> 31:45.784
-Wow.
-[Danni] No.

31:45.784 --> 31:49.421
-Okay.
-As I said, I don't know you.

31:49.921 --> 31:51.756
-Okay, fine.
-So bye.

31:52.390 --> 31:53.758
-I'm gonna keep trying.
-Train station--

31:53.758 --> 31:57.295
-Alright, all in vain.
-Well, I won't stop.

31:57.963 --> 32:00.198
-All in vain.
-[Que] Okay.

32:01.633 --> 32:04.669
-Well, I won't stop.
-Dude, suit yourself.

32:04.669 --> 32:08.607
-Birthday suit.
-You felt good about that?

32:08.607 --> 32:09.708
-Just a little.
-[Danni] You felt good?

32:09.708 --> 32:10.909
-Just a little.
-[Danni] Okay.

32:10.909 --> 32:12.110
-[Que] Wasn't cute?
-Mm-mm.

32:12.110 --> 32:13.612
Okay, okay.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.251
[sighs]

32:24.189 --> 32:27.892
[phone buzzing]

32:29.160 --> 32:30.829
-Hey.
-[Danni]<i> Hey.</i>

32:31.296 --> 32:32.464
-Are you home?
-[Sabrina]<i> Yeah.</i>

32:32.897 --> 32:36.568
-Alright, I'm on my way over.
-Okay, how long?

32:37.302 --> 32:38.503
About 45 minutes.

32:40.939 --> 32:43.375
Um yeah,
Bayo's about to be here.

32:44.342 --> 32:46.645
-Oh, the African.
-[Sabrina]<i> Mhmmm.</i>

32:46.645 --> 32:48.546
Alright, sounds like you're
doing fine to me.

32:49.681 --> 32:51.650
I'm just really worried
about Maurice.

32:53.218 --> 32:54.653
Alright, what's going on
with him?

32:55.854 --> 32:58.356
-Well, tell me if this is wrong.
-[Danni]<i> What?</i>

32:59.557 --> 33:02.894
He's the only guy that I know
with millions of dollars.

33:04.129 --> 33:06.965
Oh Sabrina, you about to ask
this man for money?

33:08.099 --> 33:10.802
Well, Andi said that
the judge was able to grant bail

33:10.802 --> 33:13.838
but it has to be in cash,
1.5 million.

33:14.839 --> 33:17.309
Damn, they think he
Osama Bin Laden?

33:18.143 --> 33:19.110
I know.

33:19.511 --> 33:21.246
And you gonna ask him
for that money?

33:21.246 --> 33:24.182
Yes, 'cause he has a lot of it.

33:24.649 --> 33:26.851
Sabrina, but do you know him
well enough?

33:27.886 --> 33:30.889
I have to do something,
for Maurice.

33:33.391 --> 33:37.295
I know, but...
Just doesn't feel right Sabrina,

33:37.295 --> 33:38.563
I don't know about this one.

33:39.264 --> 33:40.198
[Sabrina]<i> What?</i>

33:40.532 --> 33:42.167
I mean,
Maurice don't know nobody?

33:42.867 --> 33:46.304
No, do you know anybody with
that kind of money?

33:47.005 --> 33:48.807
I mean, I guess Andi, but...

33:49.607 --> 33:52.510
Yeah, she used all hers
to get me out on bail.

33:52.510 --> 33:58.416
Yeah? Damn. Hey girl, uh,
your ass better not skip bail,

33:58.416 --> 33:59.617
you know that, right?

34:01.453 --> 34:02.487
Danni, I won't.

34:03.121 --> 34:04.856
[Danni]<i> I'm, I'm just saying
I know you won't,</i>

34:04.856 --> 34:07.959
but you really wanna
bet on Maurice?

34:08.593 --> 34:09.961
I have to do something.

34:09.961 --> 34:13.331
That's your problem,
always trying to help everybody.

34:15.166 --> 34:16.067
Come on, Danni.

34:16.768 --> 34:19.571
Listen, you just call me when
he leaves, alright?

34:21.172 --> 34:22.240
Okay, I will.

34:22.240 --> 34:23.808
Alright,
and I'll just head over.

34:24.175 --> 34:26.111
-Okay.
-[Danni]<i> Okay, bye.</i>

34:26.111 --> 34:27.345
Bye.

34:38.324 --> 34:43.095
-Mr. Webb.
-My name is Diva.

34:43.729 --> 34:47.499
-You got bail.
-Well, good.

34:48.901 --> 34:50.302
Get me outta this bitch.

34:51.003 --> 34:52.438
You gotta come up with it first.

34:52.805 --> 34:55.708
-Well, I will.
-[John]<i> </i>You think?

34:56.542 --> 35:00.446
-Yes.
-Okay, well it's 1.5 million.

35:04.583 --> 35:07.886
-Okay.
-So do you have that?

35:11.523 --> 35:12.858
Get out of my face.

35:13.425 --> 35:15.427
Where'd you get it from,
robbing the bank?

35:15.427 --> 35:18.897
-No, I got it from my girdle.
-Oh, that's funny.

35:19.431 --> 35:21.934
-You're not.
-Listen, I just want you to know

35:21.934 --> 35:24.937
that you can still sign this
deal and give me Sabrina.

35:26.472 --> 35:29.108
Well, I'm not gonna do that
ever, so...

35:30.009 --> 35:33.879
You need to know that you will
be in here a long time.

35:34.913 --> 35:37.383
I have been looking at you,
and there is no way

35:37.950 --> 35:39.718
you will raise
that kind of money.

35:40.552 --> 35:42.087
Oh bitch, you don't know me.

35:42.087 --> 35:47.593
And if you do, I will be all
over you to see how you got it.

35:47.993 --> 35:50.162
Oh, don't threaten me
with a good time.

35:50.462 --> 35:51.930
I would love that,

35:51.930 --> 35:54.166
and then I could sleep better
at night, white man.

35:54.767 --> 35:57.703
Yeah, well,
you enjoy your time here.

35:58.237 --> 36:02.841
I will, it's lovely, the low
watt institutional lighting.

36:03.642 --> 36:04.777
Anytime you want to
give her up,

36:04.777 --> 36:06.345
you can walk right out
that door.

36:06.779 --> 36:08.981
-Yeah, and anytime you wanna--
-Spare me.

36:08.981 --> 36:10.749
-Uh-uh, I just wanna say--
-Nope, I don't wanna hear it.

36:10.749 --> 36:13.419
You can kiss
the crack of my ass!

36:15.654 --> 36:18.891
-Yeah, okay.
-I mean all in it.

36:23.062 --> 36:24.363
Mother-- .

36:27.499 --> 36:32.071
1.5 million dollars. [sighs]

36:37.109 --> 36:39.712
Oh, I'm slain.

36:50.089 --> 36:54.593
[sighs]
[phone buzzing]

36:56.395 --> 36:58.397
-Hey.
-Hey.

36:58.964 --> 37:01.500
-[Fatima]<i> What's up?
</i>-You home?

37:02.534 --> 37:04.570
Yeah, I'm sitting
in the driveway.

37:05.704 --> 37:08.640
-What are you doing?
-I'm going in.

37:09.174 --> 37:10.542
You need me to come by?

37:10.909 --> 37:14.113
[sighs]
No Angela, I'm good, I'm good.

37:15.647 --> 37:18.450
-Well, girl...
-[Fatima]<i> What?</i>

37:19.118 --> 37:22.154
You told me you were gonna wait,
wait for him to tell you?

37:23.355 --> 37:25.424
[sighs] Yeah, I don't know
about that.

37:26.892 --> 37:29.995
-Okay.
-Look, do you know this --

37:29.995 --> 37:31.196
hasn't hit me all day?

37:32.264 --> 37:35.134
-Is that normal?
-[Fatima]<i> No, it's not normal.</i>

37:35.634 --> 37:38.170
Zac's normally called and text
me several times by now.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.071
[Angela]<i> Hmmm.</i>

37:40.038 --> 37:41.774
Yeah, I'm just sitting in this
car getting madder and madder.

37:42.474 --> 37:45.110
Look girl, let's just go
get a drink or something

37:45.110 --> 37:46.044
before you go in.

37:46.712 --> 37:49.281
[sighs] No Angela, I'm good.
But...

37:49.715 --> 37:50.616
[Angela]<i> Fatima.</i>

37:51.350 --> 37:53.419
I'm telling you right now,
if I walk in this house

37:53.419 --> 37:56.455
and he doesn't tell me as soon
as I get in there, I'ma lose it.

37:56.889 --> 37:59.658
-Fatima.
-[Fatima]<i> Shit.</i>

38:02.494 --> 38:04.163
Are you sure your girl's legit?

38:05.631 --> 38:08.167
-Yes.
-[Fatima]<i> And Karen wouldn't</i>

38:08.167 --> 38:09.334
<i>put her up to this?</i>

38:09.334 --> 38:10.903
She don't even know her
like that.

38:12.604 --> 38:14.606
Then why was she at her salon?

38:15.707 --> 38:17.109
Girl, it's a salon.

38:17.643 --> 38:18.944
She said it was
her first time there,

38:18.944 --> 38:20.579
she wasn't even in her chair.

38:21.613 --> 38:25.017
-Okay.
-Look, I'ma come over.

38:25.851 --> 38:27.653
-Angela, I'm good.
-[Angela]<i> You sure?</i>

38:27.653 --> 38:29.354
Yes, I'm, I'm about to go in.

38:30.055 --> 38:33.325
-But Angela?
-Look, Fatima, just stay calm.

38:34.092 --> 38:37.463
[sighs] Look, I can't do this
shit, alright?

38:37.463 --> 38:38.363
[Angela]<i> I know.</i>

38:39.064 --> 38:40.833
I'm not gonna tolerate another
-- cheating on me.

38:41.733 --> 38:44.303
Mm look, stay calm.

38:44.670 --> 38:48.507
I am calm.
Look, I'm about to go in,

38:48.507 --> 38:50.476
this -- got one minute
to tell me.

38:50.476 --> 38:53.111
Fatima...look, no.
I'm coming over.

38:53.111 --> 38:54.646
No, you're not. I'm good.

38:56.081 --> 38:58.650
-Okay.
-[Fatima]<i> I'll call you after.</i>

38:58.650 --> 39:01.587
-You better.
-Alright, bye.

39:08.861 --> 39:20.806
[music]

39:32.417 --> 39:34.319
-Hey!
-Hey.

39:35.087 --> 39:35.988
[Zac] Hey.

39:37.256 --> 39:39.124
You're home early. I wasn't
expecting you for another hour.

39:42.494 --> 39:43.595
What's that?

39:46.865 --> 39:49.635
Okay, how was your day?

39:50.469 --> 39:53.105
It was good. How was yours?

39:53.805 --> 39:55.807
I mean it was actually
pretty good, like...

39:56.808 --> 39:58.810
I dropped the papers off to
Karen, you know,

39:58.810 --> 40:02.147
she signed them, it was actually
pretty easy, to be honest.

40:02.147 --> 40:03.248
But I ain't take them.

40:03.949 --> 40:07.085
-Why not?
-'Cause Andi got to look at it.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.655
-Well, did she?
-I don't know.

40:09.655 --> 40:11.990
I'm here with you, but she said
she gonna have Andi look at it,

40:11.990 --> 40:14.927
