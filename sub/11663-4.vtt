(mellow music playing)

01:11.700 --> 01:13.600
Morning, Rose, Dorothy.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.400
What a night.
Did you hear that racket out front?

01:16.467 --> 01:17.633
I didn't sleep at all.

01:17.700 --> 01:20.734
I think Dreyfuss has the hots
for our lawn flamingo.

01:23.967 --> 01:26.367
Ma, we don't have a lawn flamingo.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.734
In that case,
we'd better tip the paper boy.

01:31.867 --> 01:33.400
What's with the photo albums?

01:33.467 --> 01:36.734
I'm doing a family history,
and I'll need your help.

01:36.800 --> 01:40.467
I think it's important to tell
the grandchildren about their ancestors,

01:40.533 --> 01:43.233
give them pride in those
who came before them.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.400
Even uncle Nunzio?

01:44.467 --> 01:48.567
Even uncle Nunzio,
but we call the goat a pet.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.867
Anyway, Ma, I want you
to drag out anything

01:52.934 --> 01:55.266
that'll jog your memory
about the old days.

01:55.333 --> 01:59.633
People in St. Olaf are lucky.
We all have the same family tree.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.400
You can trace each of us
back to the same brother and sister.

02:11.100 --> 02:13.233
Well, I think
that completes the puzzle.

02:17.533 --> 02:20.767
Wait a second. Why are you asking me
questions about our family?

02:21.233 --> 02:23.300
Uh-oh. I'm going to die.

02:23.867 --> 02:25.900
You talked to my doctor. I'm going to die.

02:25.967 --> 02:28.767
The doctor says you're healthy as a horse.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.700
Actually, the doctor in
our prepaid health plan

02:31.767 --> 02:33.500
says you're healthy as a camel.

02:36.266 --> 02:38.767
I assume in his country,
it's the same as a horse.

02:40.266 --> 02:41.867
You know, Dorothy, for an extra $5.00,

02:41.934 --> 02:44.533
we can get a doctor
who sees patients one at a time.

02:49.066 --> 02:50.266
Wonderful news.

02:50.333 --> 02:53.500
The contractor says he can start building
the hot tub tomorrow.

02:53.567 --> 02:55.934
Oh, this is so exciting.

02:56.400 --> 03:00.266
You must be paying extra
to get a building permit that quickly.

03:00.333 --> 03:04.734
I'll tell you one thing, the government
won't see one cent of my money.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.467
But the city requires a permit

03:06.533 --> 03:10.700
on any new home construction built within
5 feet of a standing structure

03:10.767 --> 03:12.667
used as a primary dwelling.

03:14.467 --> 03:18.700
Rose, all this technical information.
It doesn't sound like you.

03:18.767 --> 03:23.066
If Blanche doesn't get that permit,
they could make her live in a shoe.

03:25.100 --> 03:26.734
Welcome back, sweetheart.

03:27.900 --> 03:30.233
(calm music playing)

03:30.300 --> 03:34.834
It all happened so fast.
He grabbed her. She bit him.

03:35.367 --> 03:38.266
He stuffed her in his calamari wagon
and sped away.

03:40.033 --> 03:43.500
And that, dear grandchildren,
is how my parents met.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.667
How romantic. A roll in the squid.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.600
May I remind you,

03:53.667 --> 03:57.233
the purpose of these stories
is to give the kids family pride?

03:57.300 --> 04:02.033
I'll have you know it was my father who
single-handedly invented the ransom note.

04:04.433 --> 04:06.000
If you're not going
to take this seriously,

04:06.066 --> 04:08.867
-I'll do the history by myself.
-Keep away from that.

04:08.934 --> 04:12.667
-What are... what's in the box?
-Mexican jumping beans.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.066
-Ma.
-Sorry. Hispanic jumping beans.

04:23.900 --> 04:25.834
You don't want me to know? Fine.

04:25.900 --> 04:28.467
I wouldn't dream
of infringing on your privacy.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.700
-Look! Rudy Vallee!
-Where? Where?

04:34.533 --> 04:38.000
I'll give you 3 to give me that box. One.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.967
By the way, your reflexes are a joke.

04:45.967 --> 04:47.433
Dorothy...

04:48.066 --> 04:51.533
-guess what I have under my robe.
-That guy from the circus?

04:56.600 --> 04:59.367
No, Dorothy. My new swimsuit.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.400
I'm wearing it to entice
the muscular young men

05:02.467 --> 05:04.333
who are installing my hot tub.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.800
-Would you like to see it?
-Is it a two-piece?

05:07.867 --> 05:09.133
-Yes.
-No.

05:12.266 --> 05:13.934
This is just so exciting.

05:14.000 --> 05:18.400
I love construction workers...
good with their hands, dumb as stumps,

05:18.467 --> 05:21.233
and don't mind showing their buns
when they bend over.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.567
-Look what I found.
-The box!

05:25.633 --> 05:27.367
Where did you get it?

05:27.433 --> 05:30.867
I was just under my bed playing,
and there it was.

05:34.200 --> 05:38.166
-Do you know whose it is?
-Oh, Rose. Oh, Rose...

05:38.467 --> 05:42.767
how can I look at that face and lie?
It's mine.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.233
(doorbell rings)

05:50.233 --> 05:52.767
Hi. I'm Don Benson.
I'm here about the hot tub.

05:52.834 --> 05:56.266
Oh, my goodness. Word does travel fast.

05:56.567 --> 05:58.467
It's not in yet, Don.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.600
Oh, I'm not here to soak in it.
I'm a city inspector.

06:07.667 --> 06:10.934
You can't come in here.
This house has been quarantined.

06:11.367 --> 06:12.967
We all have, uh...

06:13.500 --> 06:15.467
quick, Rose. Give me a deadly disease.

06:15.533 --> 06:18.767
Oh, I'm sorry, Blanche.
I don't have a deadly disease.

06:21.100 --> 06:22.333
Well, get one.

06:24.266 --> 06:25.367
-Yeah.
-Sorry.

06:25.433 --> 06:28.900
-We're off to a bad start.
-Won't you come in?

06:28.967 --> 06:30.433
May I help you?

06:30.500 --> 06:35.166
-Yeah. I got a call from a Lois Nylund.
-Oh, that's Rose Nylund.

06:35.233 --> 06:38.400
Rose, as in a series of seats
in a movie theatre.

06:39.700 --> 06:43.266
-Or the flower.
-Well, yeah, that too.

06:44.433 --> 06:48.900
-Rose, could I see you in the kitchen?
-Why don't you go in and find out?

06:48.967 --> 06:52.133
Get in there. Go. Go. Excuse us.

06:53.967 --> 06:57.533
-I should horsewhip you.
-I haven't even opened the damn box!

07:01.800 --> 07:03.367
I'm... I'm sorry.

07:05.734 --> 07:09.066
I can't believe you called the city
after I asked you not to.

07:09.133 --> 07:14.900
-I couldn't sit and be party to a lie.
-There are times it's all right to lie.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.533
-Dorothy will back me up. Right, Dorothy?
-No, it's not right to lie.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.033
Anybody got a bobby pin?

07:21.800 --> 07:25.200
I've calculated the cost of this hot tub
down to the last penny.

07:25.266 --> 07:27.734
I cannot afford any useless permits.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.600
If he insists I need it,
it's on your head, period.

07:32.734 --> 07:36.300
I can't believe she said that,
exclamation point.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.800
Who's to say, question mark.
New paragraph-- what the hell am I saying?

07:44.367 --> 07:45.433
Rose...

07:46.033 --> 07:49.100
Rose, this isn't my box. It's my mother's.

07:49.700 --> 07:53.166
I was going to open it, but I can't.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.433
Dorothy, I'm proud of you.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.567
I can't with a bobby pin.
Maybe with a butter knife.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.967
(serene music playing)

08:04.033 --> 08:05.567
Rose, you're off the hook.

08:05.633 --> 08:10.266
Don just made a quick inspection,
and the permit's only $40.

08:10.333 --> 08:12.400
You were right about telling the truth.

08:12.467 --> 08:15.667
If there's one thing I'm good at,
it's citizenship.

08:16.233 --> 08:18.533
That and guessing the weight
of brood sows.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
Shut up.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.300
135.

08:28.066 --> 08:32.667
It's nice to know there are still people
who don't think we're out to get them.

08:32.734 --> 08:35.066
-Somebody moving in?
-Hardly.

08:35.133 --> 08:36.934
With the three of us renting from Blanche,

08:37.000 --> 08:39.533
we're practically sleeping
on top of each other.

08:40.867 --> 08:44.266
-Oh, you can't do that.
-Well, we all wear pajamas.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.000
I mean you can't rent
to more than two people

08:49.066 --> 08:50.967
unless you have a boarding license.

08:51.033 --> 08:55.066
What the hey? Put it on my bill.
What is it, another 40?

08:55.133 --> 08:58.100
-Well, the permit's $80.
-That's not so bad.

08:58.166 --> 09:02.100
But the improvements you'll have to make
will run you about, oh, 10,000.

09:05.100 --> 09:06.900
$10,000?

09:08.300 --> 09:11.900
I can't afford that,
even if I use my hot tub money.

09:11.967 --> 09:15.867
I guess you'll have to lose a renter.
Hey, you got 48 hours.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.066
Hey, uh, Don, wait.

09:18.133 --> 09:20.333
I'm going to catch him,
but you'll sleep with him.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.400
Rose, you're not going to believe
what I found in that box.

09:30.467 --> 09:33.900
-Look at this photo.
-It's Sophia as a young bride.

09:33.967 --> 09:36.100
Yeah, but that's not my father.

09:36.900 --> 09:40.000
Ma was married to someone else
before she married pop,

09:40.066 --> 09:43.066
and she never told me.
She lied to me.

09:43.700 --> 09:47.600
I don't know this woman.
I don't know my own mother.

09:47.867 --> 09:50.967
(calm music playing)

09:51.800 --> 09:57.100
(mellow music playing)

09:57.166 --> 09:58.567
Here you are, Ma.

09:58.633 --> 10:03.000
I still have questions about our family
history, if that's okay.

10:03.066 --> 10:05.900
Fine. Just don't ask
me about the box.

10:05.967 --> 10:09.367
The box? What box? Oh! Right.

10:09.433 --> 10:12.000
It completely slipped my mind.

10:12.767 --> 10:17.600
That kind of thing happens to me all the,
uh...

10:18.100 --> 10:20.000
all the shrimp you can eat.

10:21.800 --> 10:23.133
Nice try, Ma.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.767
Let's talk about 1920.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.967
-Bad year. Now, 1918--
-I said 1920.

10:31.433 --> 10:35.567
Okay, 1920 it is.
The year I sailed for America.

10:35.633 --> 10:37.500
America.

10:37.800 --> 10:41.500
The land of opportunity
where the streets were paved with gold.

10:41.800 --> 10:46.867
And a young man named Irving Berlin
was writing songs like this, hit it.

10:51.100 --> 10:52.667
Dorothy, where's our piano player?

10:53.967 --> 10:57.333
Ma, get back on the track. 1920.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.834
-Did you date much?
-Not really.

11:00.900 --> 11:04.567
Then what about this picture
of you in a wedding gown

11:04.633 --> 11:07.700
with someone who is identified as Guido?

11:07.767 --> 11:09.467
Uh, world's fair...

11:10.500 --> 11:13.133
at the have-your-picture
taken-with-Guido booth.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.967
You were married to somebody else!
I have a right to know.

11:20.033 --> 11:24.233
Wrong. There are some things daughters
shouldn't know about their mothers.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.433
You're always sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong,

11:26.500 --> 11:28.567
like that dog Sandy we had.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.700
God, your father loved that dog.

11:35.867 --> 11:37.533
Can you believe that?

11:38.000 --> 11:41.433
After I bared my heart
and soul to that woman.

11:41.500 --> 11:45.166
-You hide things from her all the time.
-Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.266
I'm the smartest woman in the whole world!

11:50.333 --> 11:52.100
And I am the Pygmy Queen.

11:53.467 --> 11:55.066
No. Wait a minute.

11:55.133 --> 11:57.400
Blanche, what would you say
if I got a permit

11:57.467 --> 12:02.233
-to have as many people here as you want?
-What? Oh, that's terrific.

12:03.533 --> 12:05.800
Rose, this says I'm going to turn my home

12:05.867 --> 12:08.433
into a halfway house
for recently released criminals.

12:10.433 --> 12:13.367
Yes, Rose.
You are the smartest person in the world.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.133
Burger world.

12:16.533 --> 12:20.700
If I use this permit, any kind of scum
could walk through the door...

12:20.767 --> 12:24.100
thieves, murderers, men who haven't
seen women for 10 years,

12:24.166 --> 12:27.633
who've done nothing but lifting weights
and counting the days...

12:30.200 --> 12:33.166
Dorothy, remind me again
why this was a bad idea.

12:33.834 --> 12:35.200
Oh, Blanche, be serious.

12:35.266 --> 12:39.667
If we want to stay together,
we're going to have to raise $10,000.

12:39.734 --> 12:43.600
Why should I have to raise any money?
I didn't create this problem.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.734
I think the moronic Scandinavian nitwit
ought to pay it.

12:48.033 --> 12:49.834
She's talking about me, isn't she?

12:53.000 --> 12:55.834
No, Rose. She's talking about Spike Lee.

12:57.066 --> 13:01.467
Don't get smart with me, Dorothy,
just because you're out $10,000.

13:01.533 --> 13:03.533
-Me?
-Face facts.

13:03.600 --> 13:07.066
We were already roommates
when you brought your mother in...

13:07.467 --> 13:10.500
so either pay up,
or Sophia should move out.

13:10.567 --> 13:13.000
Well, thank you very much.

13:13.066 --> 13:16.734
But if anybody's going to put my mother
out in the cold,

13:16.800 --> 13:18.200
it's going to be me.

13:20.367 --> 13:24.066
-No, Rose. Forget it.
-She did dump the old lady on us.

13:24.133 --> 13:28.100
Oh. Now you're buddy-buddy with
a moronic Scandinavian nitwit?

13:28.166 --> 13:29.700
Jealous, are we?

13:31.500 --> 13:35.967
Fine. I tried to come up with a solution.
You two don't even help.

13:36.033 --> 13:40.166
-Fine. Just count me out of this.
-Fine. Just count me out of it.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.834
Fine, but it's your funeral.

13:41.900 --> 13:45.233
Nice try, Dorothy, but she'd probably need
a permit for that, too.

13:46.633 --> 13:50.200
(serene music playing)

13:51.400 --> 13:52.600
Oh, here you are.

13:53.033 --> 13:57.000
Rose, I have something to say to you,
and I want you to pay attention.

13:57.066 --> 14:00.967
-Oh, Blanche, I'm sorry.
-Oh, honey, I'm sorry, too.

14:01.033 --> 14:04.233
-Oh, no, but I'm really sorry.
-Girls, I am so sorry.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.734
-We're the ones that are sorry.
-I'm sorry.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.867
Oh, sweetie, get over here.
We're sorry, too.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.867
Yes, we are. We're really sorry.
It's our fault, too.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.433
Hey, how were you supposed to know
I had an accident in the hall?

14:18.900 --> 14:19.900
Wait.

14:19.967 --> 14:21.467
Why were you guys sorry?

14:22.166 --> 14:24.967
Oh, well, this isn't solving anything.

14:25.033 --> 14:27.233
This whole thing was my fault.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.600
I'm going to be responsible.
I'll move out.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.767
Rose, you are not moving out.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.567
Somebody has to.
How else can we choose?

14:35.633 --> 14:38.567
We could do what they do in Russia, vote.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.633
Here. It's the only fair way.

14:44.700 --> 14:48.000
I'd just like the panel
to disregard that accident in the hall.

14:49.500 --> 14:52.367
All right. Everybody write down
who you think ought to leave.

14:52.433 --> 14:55.600
This is a waste of time.
I'll just write down myself.

14:55.667 --> 14:59.533
Don't tell us that.
Maybe this is the fairest way.

14:59.600 --> 15:04.900
-But it's just going to end up being me.
-Okay.

15:05.667 --> 15:06.867
Here we go.

15:07.367 --> 15:08.934
Good luck, ladies.

15:12.500 --> 15:13.734
"Dorothy."

15:20.200 --> 15:21.400
"Dorothy."

15:30.767 --> 15:31.834
"Dorothy."

15:37.333 --> 15:38.700
"Dorothy."

15:41.767 --> 15:43.967
Well, that's that. Let's eat. I'm starved.

15:45.767 --> 15:49.734
-Wait a minute! How did this happen?
-We all voted for you.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.400
Dorothy, it's your own damn fault.
Why did you vote for yourself?

15:55.467 --> 15:58.667
I just assumed everyone
was going to vote for Rose,

15:58.734 --> 16:02.200
and I didn't want a sweep
to hurt her feelings.

16:02.867 --> 16:05.400
-That would hurt.
-It does!

16:05.867 --> 16:07.867
Oh, no.

16:07.934 --> 16:12.066
No, wait. I cannot allow this to happen.
This whole thing was my fault.

16:12.133 --> 16:13.867
I am the one who must go.

16:13.934 --> 16:18.467
-No! Nobody's going to go anywhere.
-Well, what choice do we have?

16:18.533 --> 16:22.233
I mean... oh, I'll miss you,
and you know I love you...

16:22.700 --> 16:24.100
but it's the only way.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.667
I'll have to find some other place
to rent.

16:26.734 --> 16:28.100
Stop saying that!

16:28.667 --> 16:29.867
Hey, wait a minute.

16:30.900 --> 16:34.500
The city says you can't
have three renters, but what if...

16:34.567 --> 16:38.100
-what if we're all co-owners?
-Co-owners?

16:38.166 --> 16:41.467
Yeah. You sell us each
a share of the house,

16:41.533 --> 16:44.000
and we pay you every month,

16:44.066 --> 16:47.700
but instead of paying rent,
we'll be paying the mortgage.

16:47.767 --> 16:49.166
I tell you what.

16:49.567 --> 16:53.500
Why don't we forget the mortgage?
I'll give you the house as a present?

16:53.567 --> 16:56.700
Then I'll buy all your clothes,
pay for your food,

16:56.767 --> 16:59.100
set up trust funds
for all your grandchildren.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.533
Throw in a piano player,
you got yourself a deal.

17:04.066 --> 17:06.667
Like hell. This is my home
we're talking about,

17:06.734 --> 17:08.934
and it's more than a home.
It's memories.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.000
Dorothy, this is where I lived
with my husband.

17:12.066 --> 17:16.100
It's my past and it's my future.

17:16.367 --> 17:20.367
As I move on toward middle age,
it's all I have.

17:20.934 --> 17:24.300
You're right, Blanche. It's a lot to ask.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.433
I'm sorry, but it really is.

17:27.200 --> 17:30.166
I just could never sell it,
not even to you all.

17:31.567 --> 17:37.000
(calm music playing)

17:45.767 --> 17:47.233
I know what you're gonna say, Dorothy.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.400
You can't stand to see me go,
but I made up my mind.

17:49.467 --> 17:50.867
-Rose, listen--
-Now you're gonna tell me

17:50.934 --> 17:54.567
-"I'll miss you. God, how I'll miss you."
-Rose, you have to listen to me.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.667
"You know, Rosie," you're thinking.

17:56.734 --> 18:00.300
I sure could use one last
St. Olaf story before you leave.

18:03.433 --> 18:04.800
And then I'd ask,

18:04.867 --> 18:07.667
"Shall I tell you about
how the St. Olafians

18:07.734 --> 18:11.066
were one of the original
lost tribes of Israel?"

18:14.500 --> 18:16.066
Taxi!

18:17.900 --> 18:21.567
-I knew you were gonna say that.
-Look, Rose, sit down.

18:21.633 --> 18:26.700
Now, you are not going to leave.
Rose, we need you here. Really.

18:26.767 --> 18:29.000
You're too important here.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.000
Okay, that's not believable. We love you.

18:32.567 --> 18:35.166
-(knocking on door)
-So, who's leaving?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.934
We were just discussing that, Mr. Benson.

18:38.734 --> 18:40.467
I'm afraid that no one's leaving.

18:41.033 --> 18:42.066
You see,

18:42.700 --> 18:45.700
we're a family here.
Well, not the conventional one,

18:45.767 --> 18:47.967
but we love each other, and--

18:48.033 --> 18:50.300
-Excuse me. Snoop.
-Liar.

18:50.367 --> 18:51.734
-Rhino.
-Lizard.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.633
It's real love, Mr. Benson.

18:57.734 --> 18:59.233
It's an honest love.

18:59.300 --> 19:02.767
And yes, we might have secrets
that we hide from each other--

19:02.834 --> 19:04.633
-Python.
-Swamp insect.

19:07.900 --> 19:11.900
But we're a family nonetheless,
and you can't break us up.

19:11.967 --> 19:15.467
As moving as this is,
I got to file my report.

19:15.533 --> 19:18.400
Either Mrs. Deveraux
has to bring the house up to code,

19:18.467 --> 19:20.000
or somebody's got to leave.

19:20.066 --> 19:23.133
Wait. These women no longer
live in my house.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.467
-Blanche, what are you saying?
-It's not just my house anymore.

19:27.533 --> 19:30.767
It's our house.
I've decided to share the title with you.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.266
We'll sign the deed tomorrow.

19:33.333 --> 19:36.500
That way you'll have equity,
and nobody can make you leave.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.333
By golly, you got me.

19:39.467 --> 19:42.200
Say, Don, why don't you drop back by
after the hot tub's in?

19:42.266 --> 19:43.433
Ooh.

19:46.500 --> 19:50.533
Land. I'm a landowner. I've made it.
And it only took 80 years.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.967
-Finally, property. I'll be plantin' soon.
-Ma!

19:57.834 --> 20:01.000
Blanche, this was so generous of you.
I'm so touched.

20:01.066 --> 20:05.066
I got to thinking,
this house was the home of my family,

20:05.133 --> 20:09.900
but you're right, you're family now,
so now it's our home!

20:11.033 --> 20:12.266
Rabbits.

20:13.367 --> 20:16.166
Gonna raise me some rabbits
as big as your head.

20:17.767 --> 20:21.834
(serene music playing)

20:22.800 --> 20:24.400
(knock on door)

20:24.967 --> 20:27.266
Ma, we have to talk.

20:28.166 --> 20:32.166
-I think it's time we settled this.
-Get off my property.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.166
Ma, that's enough.

20:35.633 --> 20:39.800
Now look, Ma, this isn't our relationship,
not talking to each other.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.867
Ma, I'm sure you had your reasons,

20:41.934 --> 20:47.000
but it can't have felt good
hiding this man from me all these years.

20:47.467 --> 20:50.600
-Well, no.
-Then unburden yourself, Ma...

20:50.934 --> 20:53.767
not just to your daughter,
but to your friend.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.700
Here goes.

20:57.066 --> 20:59.867
The man you saw in that picture
was Guido Spirelli.

20:59.934 --> 21:02.266
He was my first husband
through an arranged marriage

21:02.333 --> 21:04.900
-which was later annulled.
-And?

21:04.967 --> 21:08.000
And I shot him to watch him die.
What do you mean, "and"?

21:08.800 --> 21:11.800
That's all you're going
to tell me about it?

21:11.867 --> 21:14.233
We were promised to each other
when we were 9.

21:14.300 --> 21:19.433
He was considered quite a catch.
He was to inherit the family business.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.967
What was the family business?

21:21.033 --> 21:22.467
-Getting even.
-Ah.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.567
What was the problem?
You didn't love him?

21:25.633 --> 21:28.700
-Nah. He was a workaholic.
-I had the marriage annulled.

21:28.767 --> 21:32.066
Two days after it was official,
I left for America.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.333
Ma, why couldn't you tell me this?

21:34.400 --> 21:37.000
Dorothy, I went against
centuries of tradition.

21:37.333 --> 21:39.100
You don't leave an arranged marriage.

21:39.166 --> 21:42.100
I disgraced my family's
entire way of life.

21:42.166 --> 21:44.433
I think I'm finally beginning to see.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.133
Good. Then you'll have the decency to lie
if anyone asks you about it.

21:49.133 --> 21:52.600
Of course not.
It all goes in the family history.

21:52.667 --> 21:55.333
Don't do this.
don't do something we'll both regret.

21:55.400 --> 21:56.633
I have to, Ma.

21:59.266 --> 22:00.734
In 1920...

22:01.066 --> 22:03.700
your great-grandmother Sophia Petrillo...

22:04.033 --> 22:07.300
became a pioneer in
the women's rights movement.

22:08.233 --> 22:12.734
She single-handedly dragged her family
into the 20th century

22:12.800 --> 22:15.900
by refusing to be thought of as
property...

22:16.333 --> 22:19.934
and demanding instead
to marry a man she loved.

22:20.734 --> 22:23.934
To do so, she had to leave behind
everything she'd ever known...

22:25.333 --> 22:28.133
and that is the kind
of courage and strength

22:28.200 --> 22:30.834
that flows through your veins.

22:31.967 --> 22:34.033
-Pussycat.
-Yeah, Ma?

22:35.233 --> 22:37.633
-You make me very proud.
-No, Ma.

22:38.066 --> 22:39.834
You make me proud.

22:42.500 --> 22:44.200
I hope you're not waiting for a hug.

22:46.266 --> 22:48.567
Ah, come here, you tramp.

22:56.633 --> 23:02.934
(theme music playing)
