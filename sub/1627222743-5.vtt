They aren't gonna let us off
with a warning

09:25.921 --> 09:27.096
and a glass of Thai iced tea.

09:27.139 --> 09:28.619
They'll coerce a confession,

09:28.663 --> 09:30.099
then sell our combadges
on the black market.

09:30.142 --> 09:32.057
Lucky for us,
they're terrible drivers.

09:32.101 --> 09:33.885
Why is that lucky?

Don't go down the stairs!

11:01.233 --> 11:03.496
Fascinating.

11:03.540 --> 11:04.889
-I can't take it anymore.
-Hey! Hey!

11:04.933 --> 11:06.630
I got a model here. Stay back!

11:06.674 --> 11:08.327
This is humiliating.

11:08.371 --> 11:10.155
[Dooplers exclaiming]

11:10.199 --> 11:12.680
We got to get to higher ground.

Oh!
[grunts]

11:16.292 --> 11:18.816

Are you crazy?!

11:20.862 --> 11:23.212
We can escape
through the maintenance hatch.

11:23.255 --> 11:25.388
It was sealed off months ago.
Don't you remember?

11:25.431 --> 11:28.217
No, Tendi, I don't remember.
And that's the problem.

11:28.260 --> 11:30.436
My whole deal
is repairing starships.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.221
If I can't fix this little toy,

11:32.264 --> 11:34.136
then I don't even know
who I am anymore.

11:34.179 --> 11:36.529
-You're still
Samanthan Rutherford.
-Am I?

11:36.573 --> 11:39.576
The old me was better.
I can't figure out his notes,

11:39.619 --> 11:41.621
and I'm, like, a year behind
being friends with you.

11:41.665 --> 11:43.493
It's like I'm competing
with my own ghost.

Oh, yeah. "Let's move
to the aviary," he says.

12:15.960 --> 12:19.442
"It'll be so quiet," he says.

12:19.485 --> 12:21.966
Ha! We lost 'em. Never doubt me.

12:22.010 --> 12:24.142
[Mariner and Boimler scream]

Still alive.

12:51.561 --> 12:54.129
[retches]
I barfed up bubble bath.

12:54.172 --> 12:56.348
Yeah, I was there.
Thank you for the update.

12:56.392 --> 12:59.395
[grunts] We can forget about
the party, because guess what.

12:59.438 --> 13:00.875
We're probably
getting arrested instead.

13:00.918 --> 13:03.225
No way. I didn't
put on underwear for nothing.

13:03.268 --> 13:05.227
Mariner.

13:05.270 --> 13:07.751
Thank the gods whom I worship
that you're alive. [chuckles]

13:07.795 --> 13:09.884
Shut up. If you don't tell me
where that party is,

13:09.927 --> 13:12.887
I'm telling security I know
who those disruptors belong to.

13:12.930 --> 13:14.453
But you would get arrested, too.

13:14.497 --> 13:16.629
Yeah, and then we'd both be
in the same cell.

13:16.673 --> 13:19.110
-Just you and me.
-All right, all right.

13:19.154 --> 13:21.634
I'll send you the location.
But you still owe me.

13:21.678 --> 13:23.375
I owe a foot up your ass.

13:23.419 --> 13:26.335
Ballroom Alpha? Aw, that's
where all the big parties are.

13:26.378 --> 13:28.685
-How is that even a secret?
-[Boimler sighs]

13:28.728 --> 13:30.121
[groans]

13:30.165 --> 13:32.863
I knew we should have brought
the skants.

13:32.907 --> 13:35.344
[dance music playing]

13:37.737 --> 13:39.435
This is stupid.
We're soaking wet.

13:39.478 --> 13:40.871
Shh, shh, shh,
there's the bouncer.

13:40.915 --> 13:42.046
Name?

13:42.090 --> 13:43.439
Brad... William.

13:43.482 --> 13:45.397
Boimler. USS Titan.

13:45.441 --> 13:46.746
Go on in.

13:46.790 --> 13:48.357
-It worked! [laughs]
-Yeah, he just...

13:48.400 --> 13:50.141
he loves being on lists.

13:50.185 --> 13:51.360
Very excited. Whoa!

13:51.403 --> 13:52.970
-Not you.
-This is Beckett Mariner.

13:53.014 --> 13:54.885
-She's my plus-one.
-What ship you on?

13:54.929 --> 13:56.931
-Uh, the Voyager-D.
-Mm.

13:56.974 --> 13:59.324
Beckett Mariner,
ensign on the Cerritos.

13:59.368 --> 14:02.023
Nope, sorry.
Luna-class and above only.

14:02.066 --> 14:03.938
[groans]
They're not letting me in.

14:03.981 --> 14:06.157
Whatever. There's, like,
a million other things to do

14:06.201 --> 14:08.681
-on a station this big.
-But this is the best thing,

14:08.725 --> 14:09.900
-right?
-Fine.

14:09.944 --> 14:11.075
Just go in without me.

14:11.119 --> 14:12.381
I'm not gonna abandon you
out here.

14:12.424 --> 14:14.165
Oh, please. You love abandoning.

14:14.209 --> 14:15.775
No, I don't.
You'rethe abandoner.

14:15.819 --> 14:16.907
You didn't think twice
about taking

14:16.951 --> 14:18.256
that promotion to the Titan.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.431
You just couldn't wait
to leave me,

14:19.475 --> 14:21.042
just like everybody else.

14:21.085 --> 14:22.391
You're still mad
about the Titan?

14:22.434 --> 14:23.740
Why didn't you
bring it up before?

14:23.783 --> 14:25.046
Of course I'm still mad!
I've been waiting

14:25.089 --> 14:26.830
for you to apologize for weeks,
you dumb jerk.

14:26.874 --> 14:28.092
How was I supposed to know that?

14:28.136 --> 14:29.964
Maybe try being honest sometime.
[scoffs]

14:30.007 --> 14:32.009
Whatever.
I earned that promotion,

14:32.053 --> 14:34.142
but I guess you have
to make it all about you.

14:34.185 --> 14:36.057
-Some friend.
-[Mariner groans]

14:37.058 --> 14:39.234
Hey.
It's tough being vulnerable.

14:39.277 --> 14:41.149
Believe me, I know.

14:41.192 --> 14:43.151
Yeah... shut up.

14:43.194 --> 14:45.544
-[music grows louder]
-Whoa.

14:51.681 --> 14:52.943
Whoa!

14:52.987 --> 14:54.640
Captain Shelby
and her number one.

14:54.684 --> 14:55.728
[gasps]

14:55.772 --> 14:57.121
Captain Exley
and his number one.

14:57.165 --> 14:58.949
[chuckles]:
Hey, you made it.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.473
I haven't seen you
since Centauri IV.

15:04.128 --> 15:06.478
[Dooplers exclaiming]

15:06.522 --> 15:08.089
This is so awkward!

15:08.132 --> 15:09.917
You're telling me!

15:09.960 --> 15:11.701
[grunts] I'm sorry
I can't finish the model.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.137
I just have to get used
to knowing

15:13.181 --> 15:14.791
that the old me
was a better engineer.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.098
What? Rutherford,
you have it all wrong.

15:17.141 --> 15:19.448
-Old you
never finished it, either.
-What do you mean?

15:19.491 --> 15:20.579
We always stopped
at the warp core,

15:20.623 --> 15:22.842
-and then we'd start over again.
-Why?

15:22.886 --> 15:25.193
Because as long as we
were working on this,

15:25.236 --> 15:26.585
people left us alone.

15:26.629 --> 15:28.152
It was like
our social deflector dish.

15:28.196 --> 15:30.589
We got to hang out
without anyone bugging us.

15:30.633 --> 15:32.504
So all these notes
from old me...?

15:32.548 --> 15:34.985
Are probably just to slow down
and buy time.

15:35.029 --> 15:36.334
I wasn'tsmarter than me!

15:36.378 --> 15:38.032
-[screams]
-I'm glad you're feeling better.

15:38.075 --> 15:39.381
Too bad we're gonna get crushed.

15:39.424 --> 15:41.687
Not if we detonate
the warp core.

15:43.689 --> 15:45.778
[grunts]

15:45.822 --> 15:48.433
-Come on.

16:09.541 --> 16:10.978
[exhales]

16:11.021 --> 16:12.892
Is this because of us?

16:12.936 --> 16:15.025
They don't like us!

16:17.071 --> 16:18.246
[groans]

16:18.289 --> 16:20.857
Uh, can I get
five more of these?

16:20.900 --> 16:23.468
-You, uh, think
that's a good idea?
-Hmm.

16:23.512 --> 16:25.775
Interesting. I'm actually going
for "bad idea."

16:25.818 --> 16:27.429
-[door whooshes open]
-Put those on my tab.

16:27.472 --> 16:29.561
Plus a prune juice spritz.

16:31.085 --> 16:33.043
Don't tell me
the party was boring.

16:33.087 --> 16:35.219
It was amazing. Nonstop sliders.

16:35.263 --> 16:38.483
You love sliders.
So why'd you leave?

16:38.527 --> 16:39.963
-It just wasn't fun.
-Hmm.

16:40.007 --> 16:41.704
-Not enough famous admirals?
-There were,

16:41.747 --> 16:44.054
but you weren't there
to make fun of them with me.

16:44.098 --> 16:47.057
[sighs] I'm sorry I left
for the Titanthe way I did.

16:47.101 --> 16:50.104
I guess I was worried
you would talk me out of it.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.670
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

16:51.714 --> 16:54.108
I didn't even know
you hadfeelings.

16:54.151 --> 16:55.370
Of course I do.

16:55.413 --> 16:57.154
I just don't show them
to everyone.

16:57.198 --> 16:59.287
I don't know why
I make an exception for you.

16:59.330 --> 17:01.419
Maybe because
you're my number one.

17:01.463 --> 17:03.073
[laughs]

17:03.117 --> 17:05.684
Wow. No, if anything,
you're mynumber one.

17:05.728 --> 17:07.512
-I'm your mentor.
-[scoffs] Nice try.

17:07.556 --> 17:09.993
-We've already done that.
-It goes by force
of personality.

17:10.037 --> 17:11.386
Me. Then you.

17:11.429 --> 17:14.389
No, don't make me
bump you down to number two.

17:14.432 --> 17:17.218
Thanks for coming to hang.
I'm sorry I ruined the party.

17:17.261 --> 17:19.829
I can replicate sliders whenever
I want back on the Cerritos.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.265
Who needs to be at the coolest,

-[grunts, screams]

17:32.929 --> 17:34.844
Enough. Enough!

17:34.887 --> 17:37.412
Stop being
such whiny little [bleep]!

17:37.455 --> 17:39.196
Wh-What did you say?

17:39.240 --> 17:43.548
You idiots need to shut up
and stop being sniveling babies!

17:43.592 --> 17:45.376
-[Doopler grunts]
-[gasps]

17:45.420 --> 17:47.465
Did you see that?
I berated them,

17:47.509 --> 17:49.076
and they recombined.

17:49.119 --> 17:51.121
Getting embarrassed
makes them lose control,

17:51.165 --> 17:52.992
but getting pissed
helps them get it back.

17:53.036 --> 17:54.385
Hey! You're a jerk!

17:54.429 --> 17:56.996
Excuse me?
[grunts]

17:57.040 --> 17:58.824
Attention, everyone.

17:58.868 --> 18:01.305
Stop being careful
around the Dooplers.

18:01.349 --> 18:04.265
Yell at them.
Call them spineless punks.

18:04.308 --> 18:05.918
I know we're Starfleet,

18:05.962 --> 18:09.487
but really give them
a piece of your mind.

18:09.531 --> 18:11.924
Your pagh is weak,
and it disgusts me!

18:11.968 --> 18:15.319
I don't even know what that is,
but I don't like your tone.

[Dooplers grunting]
