WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.249
Previously on "Station 19"...
It is crazy.

00:03.250 --> 00:04.499
That a marriage license could
protect us from the rules.

00:04.500 --> 00:05.829
Are you really considering this?

00:05.830 --> 00:08.169
I want Ripley. And I want my
job. And this gets me both.

00:08.170 --> 00:10.919
It's my call. No, you're too close to this.
The call is mine.

00:10.920 --> 00:12.169
She's my world.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.810
I don't need you
to talk to me ever again.

00:15.540 --> 00:16.879
My God.

00:16.880 --> 00:18.579
To new beginnings.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.999
Conlin's still inside.

00:20.000 --> 00:21.709
I'm coming back. I promise.

00:21.710 --> 00:23.379
Lucas Ripley,
will you marry me, for real?

00:23.380 --> 00:24.619
I'll see you at the diner.

00:24.620 --> 00:26.419
He didn't show. Now I'm getting
back to work, okay?

00:26.420 --> 00:28.380
Somebody call 911!

00:30.290 --> 00:32.209
There's this firefighter motto,

00:32.210 --> 00:34.789
a Latin phrase...
"Semper Paratus."

00:34.790 --> 00:37.119
It means "Always Ready."
Come on, Luke, pick up.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.289
So, the Chief has low calcium
levels, and that means...

00:39.290 --> 00:42.619
His numbers indicate that he was
exposed to some potent toxin.

00:42.620 --> 00:45.959
Hydrocarbon, fluorocarbon,
maybe even hydrofluoric acid.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.209
It's hard to say without knowing
the contamination source.

00:48.210 --> 00:49.919
Can you please call him again?

00:49.920 --> 00:51.119
Considering the aortic stenosis

00:51.120 --> 00:52.579
has already put stress
on his heart...

00:52.580 --> 00:53.789
You're worried about
pulmonary edema,

00:53.790 --> 00:55.459
respiratory distress,
arrhythmias...

00:55.460 --> 00:57.709
I can't believe he just
checked himself out.

00:57.710 --> 00:59.879
He wants to explain to Vic...
I don't care what he wants!

00:59.880 --> 01:02.039
I need him here,
not Lancelot-ing

01:02.040 --> 01:03.789
all around Seattle
looking for his girlfriend.

01:03.790 --> 01:04.998
So we go get him.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.419
But go where?
We don't know where he is.

01:06.420 --> 01:07.959
If he's not answering...
If we find Vic,

01:07.960 --> 01:09.829
we'll find Chief Ripley.
It's our best shot.

01:09.830 --> 01:11.619
Then we'll deliver him
straight to you.

01:11.620 --> 01:13.290
Okay. I will be here.

01:14.580 --> 01:16.789
Hey, I know you're not used
to taking orders

01:16.790 --> 01:18.419
from other people, Chief,
but right now,

01:18.420 --> 01:19.499
I am the boss of you,

01:19.500 --> 01:21.499
and I need you
to pick up my call.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.579
We're "always ready"
for any fire,

01:23.580 --> 01:25.669
any rescue, any complication.

01:25.670 --> 01:29.289
But being ready for anything
the world throws at you...

01:29.290 --> 01:31.119
I can't take your call,
so do your thing!

01:31.120 --> 01:32.919
Victoria, I know you're mad,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.169
but I can explain everything,
okay? In person.

01:35.170 --> 01:36.959
Dispatch said you were still
at the coffee plant,

01:36.960 --> 01:38.169
so I'm coming to you.

01:38.170 --> 01:39.249
Don't move.

01:39.250 --> 01:40.789
That's a very big ask.

01:40.790 --> 01:42.329
Vic's voicemail. Again.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.619
Confirmed. Ladder 19

01:43.620 --> 01:45.119
is still at
the coffee plant overhaul.

01:45.120 --> 01:46.619
Can't we radio Hughes
through Dispatch?

01:46.620 --> 01:49.289
No. We can't just put
the Chief's condition on blast.

01:49.290 --> 01:51.169
It's too important.
It's too serious.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.789
It's a delicate situation.

01:52.790 --> 01:54.619
Yeah, well, I'm still trying to
wrap my brain around that part,

01:54.620 --> 01:55.669
the delicate part...

01:55.670 --> 01:57.119
Chief Ripley and Vic, a couple.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.959
News about their relationship
could damage her career.

01:58.960 --> 02:00.829
We can't just announce that.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.999
So we extricate her from the
call and tell her in person?

02:03.000 --> 02:04.039
Yeah, it's the best way.

02:04.040 --> 02:06.619
Luke! Pick up the phone,
damn it!

02:06.620 --> 02:08.788
Okay. I know it's kind of

02:08.789 --> 02:10.329
hilariously embarrassing

02:10.330 --> 02:12.289
how many voicemails
I've left you.

02:12.290 --> 02:14.670
I hope, at least,
they make you laugh.

02:16.670 --> 02:19.499
See you soon, Eggy.

02:19.500 --> 02:22.169
Okay, I know I'm bad for
slipping out on Dr. Pierce.

02:22.170 --> 02:23.459
I don't care about that.

02:23.460 --> 02:25.329
I can manage with my heart valve
thing for an hour,

02:25.330 --> 02:26.669
until I find Vic.

02:26.670 --> 02:28.669
It's not like it's an
emergency... Luke, shut up!

02:28.670 --> 02:30.419
Your tests came back, okay?

02:30.420 --> 02:32.499
It looks like you've been
exposed to something.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.079
Okay.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.999
There's a chance
it's hydrofluoric acid.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.419
But I...
And if that's the case...

02:38.420 --> 02:41.379
Hydrofluoric acid?
I mean, that...

02:41.380 --> 02:43.329
That's the one that messes
with your calcium, right?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.709
But... I don't have any burns.

02:45.710 --> 02:47.669
I-It's possible you inhaled it,

02:47.670 --> 02:49.499
which Pierce says
it can be lethal.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.669
She can treat it
if you go to the hospital.

02:51.670 --> 02:52.999
Immediately, sir.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.169
If it is hydrofluoric acid,
once the process starts,

02:55.170 --> 02:57.169
it progresses very quickly.

02:57.170 --> 02:58.329
Well, I... I feel fine.

02:58.330 --> 02:59.829
I got a...
I got a scratchy throat and...

02:59.830 --> 03:03.170
Luke. You need to get
to a hospital right now.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.879
Alright. I...

03:06.880 --> 03:08.459
I'm a few blocks
from Seattle Pres.

03:08.460 --> 03:11.459
I think I'll... I guess I'll
pull in there, but, Sully...

03:11.460 --> 03:13.579
Promise me you'll find Vic.

03:13.580 --> 03:15.209
Bring her to me.

03:15.210 --> 03:17.120
I promise.

03:19.000 --> 03:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:28.880 --> 03:30.289
No hot spots here!

03:30.290 --> 03:31.879
Southwest corner's clear.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.619
We'll clear
the east corridor next.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.959
Hey, you guys good? Better than
the stairwell. Full collapse.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.209
No injuries, though.

03:37.210 --> 03:38.709
It is a crime
to be working a call

03:38.710 --> 03:40.789
that smells of
such caffeinated goodness

03:40.790 --> 03:42.209
and not being able
to stop and eat

03:42.210 --> 03:44.079
every pancake on the planet.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.579
Hughes! Pause.

03:45.580 --> 03:47.459
I set up a wellness check
station outside

03:47.460 --> 03:48.919
for everybody pulling doubles.

03:48.920 --> 03:51.249
Sir. Make sure you're
all staying hydrated.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.919
Guess what's useless if nobody
shows up to be checked?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.789
Me and my wellness check
station.

03:55.790 --> 03:56.919
So I come to you. You're fine.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.119
Miller.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.419
Bishop! Freeze.

03:59.420 --> 04:01.079
Clear signs of dehydration,
both of you.

04:01.080 --> 04:02.419
You haven't even
examined me yet.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.119
We can work. No...

04:04.120 --> 04:05.959
Your foreheads don't have
a drop of sweat on them.

04:05.960 --> 04:07.249
In this heat,
that's all I need to see.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.619
You two do less-intensive work,

04:08.620 --> 04:11.249
like recovering discarded gear
and sorting it by company.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.079
Montgomery, turn around.

04:13.080 --> 04:16.500
You know you technically can't
give us orders anymore, right?

04:18.920 --> 04:20.420
Yes, sir.

04:26.620 --> 04:28.289
I-I need help.

04:28.290 --> 04:30.079
Okay.
What seems to be the problem?

04:30.080 --> 04:31.669
I'm a firefighter,
and I think I've been

04:31.670 --> 04:34.039
exposed to something... It's...

04:34.040 --> 04:36.959
There's a chance it could be
hydrofluoric acid.

04:36.960 --> 04:38.499
You have a cough,
trouble breathing?

04:38.500 --> 04:39.619
Does your throat burn?

04:39.620 --> 04:42.119
Yeah, a little bit.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.169
I-I got treated earlier today
for a collapse.

04:44.170 --> 04:45.999
Could you call my doctor,
please? Maggie Pierce.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.709
She's at, Grey-Sloan Memorial.

04:48.710 --> 04:50.539
I got a patient here
of Dr. Pierce's.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.830
It's urgent!

04:53.670 --> 04:55.379
Hughes to Incident Command.
We're done over here.

04:55.380 --> 04:56.999
Ready to go back into rotation.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.119
Really?

04:58.120 --> 04:59.619
We just got out of
overhaul hell.

04:59.620 --> 05:00.999
You're already asking for more?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.999
Roger that. Ladder 19 is cleared

05:03.000 --> 05:05.039
and back in rotation
for active calls.

05:05.040 --> 05:06.379
This is avoidance.

05:06.380 --> 05:08.289
We need to talk.

05:08.290 --> 05:10.499
Vic, hey.

05:10.500 --> 05:12.380
How long did you wait
at that diner?

05:14.830 --> 05:16.169
Nope. Not doing this.
No talking.

05:16.170 --> 05:18.380
Talking feels like
a really bad idea right now.

05:21.830 --> 05:23.829
Talk. Please, say something.

05:23.830 --> 05:25.669
You've been eating cake
very quietly.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.209
Now you're cleaning up cake
very quietly,

05:27.210 --> 05:29.999
and I can't be doing
all the talking, so...

05:30.000 --> 05:31.499
Your turn.

05:31.500 --> 05:34.169
For... For Spice?

05:34.170 --> 05:36.249
Okay.

05:36.250 --> 05:37.919
Okay, are you making fun of me?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.999
Nope. Not at all. I'm just, -

05:40.000 --> 05:41.669
just wondering what
that was about before,

05:41.670 --> 05:45.579
and... what you're
thinking about now.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.829
I'm thinking about
lots of things,

05:47.830 --> 05:48.999
like a whole brain
full of things

05:49.000 --> 05:50.329
I shouldn't be thinking
right now.

05:50.330 --> 05:51.999
I'm a fountain of bad ideas.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.499
Like what?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.540
I was...

05:57.540 --> 06:00.710
thinking about getting
a drink after shift.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.539
I like company when I drink.

06:03.540 --> 06:04.790
You could be company.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.119
Like I said, bad idea.

06:09.120 --> 06:12.289
I mean, if you invited me,
it would be, -

06:12.290 --> 06:14.419
it'd be rude not to join.

06:14.420 --> 06:16.289
For just a drink.

06:16.290 --> 06:17.879
Right. Just a drink.

06:17.880 --> 06:19.539
I can't believe Dutton's
is closed.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.749
A bar, closed at 830 a.m.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.919
I mean, don't they realize
we've been on call for 24 hours?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.879
Yeah, they have the best stale
breakfast popcorn.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.879
Would you settle for a stale
breakfast bagel?

06:27.880 --> 06:29.960
I know a place. My place is
right around the corner.

06:31.460 --> 06:33.919
I mean, I just... I didn't mean
to imply, I was just...

06:33.920 --> 06:35.709
I mean, it's so close, you know?
Yeah, of course.

06:35.710 --> 06:37.829
Not that it's weird for someone to
see us together out here, off-duty.

06:37.830 --> 06:39.289
Why... Why would it be weird?
No, it's not.

06:39.290 --> 06:40.749
It's not like we're doing
anything wrong.

06:40.750 --> 06:42.669
Just a little conversation.
Exactly.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.579
So, um...

06:45.580 --> 06:48.669
But, you know, I don't know,
if we did want to...

06:48.670 --> 06:50.959
sit or anything,

06:50.960 --> 06:53.579
conversation could also
happen there.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.459
At my place.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.999
Conversation could happen there.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.619
Unless you think it's a...

07:00.620 --> 07:02.120
it's a bad idea.

07:41.290 --> 07:44.620
I was wrong.
This is a fantastic idea.

07:49.500 --> 07:51.829
I just think talking might help.

07:51.830 --> 07:53.539
No need to whisper
for Gibson's sake.

07:53.540 --> 07:55.619
You know he knows. That's okay.
I-I don't need to...

07:55.620 --> 07:58.039
No, actually, fine.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.999
I asked Ripley to marry me
and he stood me up,

08:01.000 --> 08:02.329
so now I'm pretty sure
we're done,

08:02.330 --> 08:04.749
and I'm feeling really good
right now, so...

08:04.750 --> 08:06.579
Cool? We all up to speed?

08:06.580 --> 08:07.829
Sure.

08:07.830 --> 08:08.999
Goodie.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.879
Ladder 19. Aid Car 15.

08:10.880 --> 08:12.919
Person in distress
on Bryn Mawr Tower...

08:12.920 --> 08:14.329
Ella Lee Trail.

08:14.330 --> 08:16.879
Great. The faster we load,
the faster we do something.

08:16.880 --> 08:18.000
So let's go!

08:18.880 --> 08:20.879
Maggie Pierce, Head of Cardio,
Grey-Sloan.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.249
I'm looking for Lucas Ripley.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.829
Okay.

08:25.830 --> 08:29.040
Last name Ripley...

08:30.250 --> 08:32.419
Okay, I need you to skip
the slow searching thing

08:32.419 --> 08:34.169
that you're doing because
my patient is the Fire Chief,

08:34.169 --> 08:35.999
and he has a pre-existing
heart condition.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.499
Doctors at this hospital
nearly killed our Chief Bailey

08:38.500 --> 08:40.419
until I arrived
and brought the thunder.

08:40.419 --> 08:43.119
Do you need me to do that again?

08:43.120 --> 08:44.539
No? Good.

08:44.540 --> 08:48.210
Then get me some privileges and
access to my patient right now.

08:52.250 --> 08:54.209
Hey. Yeah, I'm getting Ripley.

08:54.210 --> 08:55.459
Do you have Vic?

08:55.460 --> 08:56.540
Any minute now.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.079
Dad!

09:02.080 --> 09:04.119
Have you seen Hughes? Yeah.
Checked her out a bit ago.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.419
We need her. It's urgent.

09:05.420 --> 09:06.709
Well, another call came in
a couple minutes ago.

09:06.710 --> 09:07.710
Ladder Truck took it.

09:07.711 --> 09:08.959
Are you sure? Damn.

09:08.960 --> 09:11.079
Yeah. What's going on?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.379
Come on.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.879
Herrera to Dispatch.
I need an updated location

09:14.880 --> 09:16.460
to Ladder 19 right now!

09:26.250 --> 09:28.919
Who is that up there?
I wish I could tell you.

09:28.920 --> 09:30.789
We got a whole slew
of 911 calls about her.

09:30.790 --> 09:32.459
Doesn't seem like a threat
to public safety.

09:32.460 --> 09:34.499
That doesn't mean she isn't
a threat to her own safety.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.749
I tried talking her down,
but then she climbed higher,

09:36.750 --> 09:37.959
so I shut up.

09:37.960 --> 09:39.419
On a call like this, the
civilian's the one in charge.

09:39.420 --> 09:42.419
She is really high up.
The ladder's not gonna reach.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.919
Do you guys have an airbag
or something?

09:43.920 --> 09:45.749
Let's double time it
on that rescue cushion.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.749
The only option I see is
for one of us to climb up,

09:47.750 --> 09:48.789
try and coax her down.

09:48.790 --> 09:49.750
I'll go.

09:49.751 --> 09:51.289
No, Vic. Jack or I can go.

09:51.290 --> 09:52.789
You don't have...
Hey, I got dumped.

09:52.790 --> 09:54.619
Doesn't mean I can't do
my damn job.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.119
Gibson, I mean it. Let me go.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.420
I can do this.

09:59.960 --> 10:02.919
Alright, finish harnessing up.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.119
Alright. No radios.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.169
You heard Tanner,
it agitates her.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.050
Switching to TAC Channel 3.
That line's private.

10:12.290 --> 10:13.460
Where's that bag?

10:18.620 --> 10:20.669
If she needs a break,
she'll say so.

10:20.670 --> 10:21.790
Come on.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.710
Right.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.289
Here's an axe from 66.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.959
Got a helmet from 88.

10:30.960 --> 10:33.459
And a glove from...

10:33.460 --> 10:35.619
This is Gibson's, actually.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.169
So when were you planning
on telling me?

10:37.170 --> 10:39.619
About Gibson's glove?
I just did.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.329
Do you think that I don't
notice the two of you

10:41.330 --> 10:43.499
sneaking into my houseboat
in the wee hours

10:43.500 --> 10:46.829
or you sneaking out of it
in the even wee-er hours?

10:46.830 --> 10:48.079
You've known?

10:48.080 --> 10:50.579
About me and Jack?

10:50.580 --> 10:53.329
This is great. I have
so many feelings about this

10:53.330 --> 10:54.499
and no one to tell them to.

10:54.500 --> 10:56.419
Andy's mad about it.
I tried talking to a baby,

10:56.420 --> 10:58.079
but you're way better
than a baby.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.710
Not the reaction
I was expecting.

11:10.330 --> 11:12.829
Hi.

11:12.830 --> 11:14.169
I'm Vic. I'm a firefighter.

11:14.170 --> 11:16.169
Can you tell me your name?

11:16.170 --> 11:17.329
Gwen.

11:17.330 --> 11:18.579
Nice to meet you, Gwen.

11:18.580 --> 11:20.329
How you feeling?

11:20.330 --> 11:21.330
A little lost.

11:21.331 --> 11:22.500
I hear that.

11:24.670 --> 11:26.249
Does your head hurt, Gwen?

11:26.250 --> 11:29.789
That's kind of
a loaded question.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.959
Well, do you mind if I get a
little closer and check you out,

11:31.960 --> 11:33.209
maybe slip this harness on you?

11:33.210 --> 11:34.789
Please, don't! O-Okay.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.919
Okay. You're in charge here.

11:36.920 --> 11:38.420
Montgomery!

11:40.920 --> 11:41.880
Where's Vic?

11:41.881 --> 11:43.119
What's wrong?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.959
Just something we have to
tell her face-to-face.

11:44.960 --> 11:47.290
She's... a little busy
right now.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.459
You must think I'm crazy. No.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.039
One thing about me...
I don't judge.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.879
I think everyone's just
doing the best they can,

11:55.880 --> 11:57.209
you included.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.459
Okay.

11:58.460 --> 12:01.709
Are you on any medications?

12:01.710 --> 12:03.459
A couple, yeah.

12:03.460 --> 12:05.119
Okay. But I missed doses.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.789
Happens to the best of us.
What's the medication for?

12:07.790 --> 12:09.959
My anxiety.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.169
Mood swings. Bad days.

12:12.170 --> 12:13.830
Stuff like that. Gotcha.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.079
God, this is really high.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.249
Okay. I can't.

12:19.250 --> 12:21.289
Okay, okay. You know what?
We don't have to.

12:21.290 --> 12:22.749
Alright?

12:22.750 --> 12:26.459
Hey, what's that in your hand?

12:26.460 --> 12:28.289
It's a... car.

12:28.290 --> 12:31.419
My daughter...
She's 6, and she loves cars.

12:31.420 --> 12:32.919
This one's her favorite.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.419
It's super-charged.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.959
Tiny, but strong.

12:35.960 --> 12:37.119
So you have a daughter?

12:37.120 --> 12:39.919
She slipped it in my pocket
this morning.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.790
For luck.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.249
Tiny but strong. I like that.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.419
Didn't work, though.

12:43.420 --> 12:45.079
I had a big meeting
with my boss.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.669
They laid us all off.

12:46.670 --> 12:48.419
No warning, nothing.

12:48.420 --> 12:51.119
I was driving home, but I'm
never home from work this early.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.120
I needed some quiet.

12:54.540 --> 12:56.379
It is quiet up here.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.290
The world can feel a little
too loud sometimes.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.959
We can find a quiet spot
for you down there, too.

13:01.960 --> 13:03.329
Let's climb down. I said no!

13:03.330 --> 13:05.709
O-Okay. There's no rush.

13:05.710 --> 13:07.119
You're in charge, remember?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.789
One hell of a call to interrupt.

13:08.790 --> 13:10.119
Sorry, did I just
hear you right?

13:10.120 --> 13:11.669
You guys want to radio
Hughes right now?

13:11.670 --> 13:13.119
There's something
she needs to know.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.789
Hughes is with
an unstable civilian.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.619
No, I agree with Tanner.
It's a big risk.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.619
If Hughes misses her chance
to see Ripley

13:18.620 --> 13:20.119
because we didn't tell her...

13:20.120 --> 13:21.959
Guys. They're balanced
on the edge.

13:21.960 --> 13:24.459
It's Hughes up there.
She's Teflon. She can handle it.

13:24.460 --> 13:25.789
But what if the patient can't?
We should wait.

13:25.790 --> 13:27.119
No time to wait. Radio up.

13:27.120 --> 13:29.169
All respect, sir, but FD's
not running this call right now.

13:29.170 --> 13:30.499
I am. Not anymore.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.620
Herrera, radio Hughes.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.999
What was that?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.669
Nothing. It's no big deal.
It's just my radio.

13:37.670 --> 13:39.999
Guys, I thought
I said no radios.

13:40.000 --> 13:41.499
Vic, we need you to come down!

13:41.500 --> 13:42.999
No! Please, don't go.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.999
Negative, Herrera.
We're not moving.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.999
No, we're tagging you out.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.249
I'll come up, but we need you
to come down.

13:49.250 --> 13:51.039
No, no, no, no, no!
Please don't leave me.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.829
Shh! Gwen, it's okay.
I'm not going anywhere.

13:52.830 --> 13:54.329
Andy, you are making things
worse up here.

13:54.330 --> 13:55.579
I know, I'm sorry, but...

13:55.580 --> 13:56.999
Okay, I'm turning
the radio off now.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.329
No! There's news.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.039
Okay, well, it's gonna have
to wait, alright?

14:00.040 --> 14:03.169
Gwen. Gwen.
I am not leaving, okay?

14:03.170 --> 14:04.669
Don't worry. It can't wait!

14:04.670 --> 14:06.499
I told you I'm not going
anywhere, alright?

14:06.500 --> 14:07.749
If you have news,
give me the news,

14:07.750 --> 14:09.110
but I am not coming down
to get it.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.539
Okay, so what do we do?

14:11.540 --> 14:14.079
She can handle it. Right?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.380
I hate this.

14:16.750 --> 14:17.710
Vic, hey.

14:17.711 --> 14:20.289
What is going on down there?

14:20.290 --> 14:21.709
It's Ripley.

14:21.710 --> 14:25.459
He was exposed to some pretty
potent toxins, it seems.

14:25.460 --> 14:27.289
How potent?

14:27.290 --> 14:28.959
Vic, let us tag you out.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.250
Please.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.709
I don't know
who they're talking about,

14:34.710 --> 14:36.879
but I'm looking
at your face, and...

14:36.880 --> 14:38.209
you should go.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.789
I can't be the reason
you miss seeing

14:39.790 --> 14:41.619
someone who's sick or dying.

14:41.620 --> 14:43.579
- Gwen. Gwen!
- God!

14:43.580 --> 14:46.039
- Get back, get back!
- You got that?

14:46.040 --> 14:48.539
Gwen, stop moving! Let me
hook up to you first, okay?

14:48.540 --> 14:50.749
I'm holding as tight as I can,
but I keep sliding!

14:50.750 --> 14:52.789
Okay, just hold on!
Just hold on, Gwen!

14:52.790 --> 14:54.579
Go. Go! No. No!

14:54.580 --> 14:56.289
I'll just hold on even tighter!

14:56.290 --> 14:58.830
I am not leaving you, Gwen.
That is how this works.

15:03.420 --> 15:05.459
Okay, I'm gonna tie
this harness around you,

15:05.460 --> 15:06.919
and then we're gonna
climb down together, okay?

15:06.920 --> 15:10.789
Okay. I got you, I got you.
Alright?

15:10.790 --> 15:12.749
Hold on. Hold on.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.079
Okay. There!

15:14.080 --> 15:16.079
Okay, harness is in place.
Now hold on to me.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.579
I can't move! Hold on to me.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.619
Gwen. Please, Gwen.

15:19.620 --> 15:21.619
Please try.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.619
I can barely hold on.
I need you to focus.

15:23.620 --> 15:25.079
I can't stop looking down.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.829
Just focus on me, okay?
Focus on me.

15:26.830 --> 15:27.620
Focus... No.

15:27.621 --> 15:29.919
Okay. Focus... Eggy!

15:29.920 --> 15:31.460
Okay? He calls me Eggy.

15:34.250 --> 15:36.079
What?

15:36.080 --> 15:39.119
The guy, the one I ne...
The one I need to get to,

15:39.120 --> 15:41.619
the one who is in trouble.

15:41.620 --> 15:45.209
I care about him a lot,
and that is his name for me.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.540
Eggy?

15:48.710 --> 15:49.959
Just in time.

15:49.960 --> 15:53.119
Um, may I please have
the eggy thing?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.119
That dish has a name.
Cam knows what I mean.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.209
I do not,
but I know what you want

15:57.210 --> 15:59.329
because your hubby
already ordered for you.

15:59.330 --> 16:01.789
I am...

16:01.790 --> 16:03.539
Yes, I ordered your usual.

16:03.540 --> 16:04.669
Eggy.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.459
Eggy.

16:06.460 --> 16:08.619
You guys, can I just say,

16:08.620 --> 16:10.789
I know I scolded you
for the parking lot incident...

16:10.790 --> 16:12.379
You... you were just
doing your job.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.169
My God, I'm really glad
that you see it that way

16:14.170 --> 16:16.959
because you two are, like,
relationship goals.

16:16.960 --> 16:18.959
And I hope that I'm still
getting busy in the parking lot

16:18.960 --> 16:20.209
when I get married.

16:20.210 --> 16:21.539
That's an interesting goal.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.880
Eggies on me today.

16:27.170 --> 16:29.330
So, that's sticking? Yeah.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.249
Eggy. Okay, Hubby.

16:32.250 --> 16:34.079
He came to that conclusion
all on his own.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.419
He can come to conclusions
all day long

16:35.420 --> 16:37.829
if it keeps getting us
free eggy things.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.209
So, in this new fake marriage
thing we've got going,

16:40.210 --> 16:42.329
um, do we have pets?

16:42.330 --> 16:44.249
Can we be spies?

16:44.250 --> 16:45.919
God, I hope your family
likes me.

16:45.920 --> 16:48.169
My family's really
just my sister, so...

16:48.170 --> 16:49.170
Jennifer.

16:49.171 --> 16:50.329
That's the one. Right? Yeah.

16:50.330 --> 16:51.829
And I'll bet she
at least likes you better

16:51.830 --> 16:53.330
than my first two wives.

16:56.670 --> 16:58.329
Wives.

16:58.330 --> 16:59.749
As in plural.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.419
Yeah.

17:01.420 --> 17:05.118
Sorry, I didn't mean to open up
this conversation, exactly.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.118
No, I mean, I, um...

17:07.119 --> 17:09.709
You know, I never asked, so...

17:09.710 --> 17:12.540
So I guess marriage just isn't
such a serious thing for you.

17:14.619 --> 17:18.539
Look, the first time around,
I thought I was very serious,

17:18.540 --> 17:20.618
but we were really young,
and it fizzled fast.

17:20.619 --> 17:24.289
The second time, I...
I felt good about Eva,

17:24.290 --> 17:27.618
but by the end, I'm not even
sure that she liked me.

17:27.619 --> 17:30.039
Ouch. Yeah.

17:30.040 --> 17:32.039
Now, marriage number three...

17:32.040 --> 17:35.079
That I would take
very seriously.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.210
I wouldn't be game unless
I knew it was really right.

17:39.250 --> 17:41.709
You are strong,
and you can handle this.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.619
Just like the toy car,
you're tiny but strong.

17:44.620 --> 17:46.419
No. I'm not.

17:46.420 --> 17:47.830
You are.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.119
Hold on to me.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.329
I got you.

17:53.330 --> 17:54.829
Focus on me.

17:54.830 --> 17:56.250
You can do this.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.289
Come here. Yeah.

18:00.290 --> 18:01.789
Okay. Okay, good, I've got you.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.749
Now let's climb down.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.750
Okay.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.459
Okay. Okay, Gwen.

18:10.460 --> 18:13.749
You're almost there.
You're okay.

18:13.750 --> 18:16.960
Okay. You did great.

18:24.420 --> 18:26.459
For strength.

18:26.460 --> 18:27.460
Good luck.

18:27.461 --> 18:29.119
Thank you.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.459
We got her, Vic. You got to go.

18:30.460 --> 18:32.709
Wait. Tell the hospital
she's off her anxiety meds

18:32.710 --> 18:33.879
and possibly manic.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.039
And make sure they call
her husband, okay?

18:35.040 --> 18:36.619
Okay. Gibson and I
will meet you there.

18:36.620 --> 18:37.960
Let's go!

18:43.170 --> 18:45.289
Captain Conlin's been diagnosed

18:45.290 --> 18:46.879
with the same symptoms
as Ripley.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.879
Looks like the coffee plant fire
was the only call

18:48.880 --> 18:50.209
they both went on this week,

18:50.210 --> 18:52.119
and we just got confirmation
that the plant uses

18:52.120 --> 18:55.329
a cleaning agent made
from hydrofluoric acid.

18:55.330 --> 18:56.709
We were all in that fire.

18:56.710 --> 18:58.379
Everyone gets
their calcium levels checked

18:58.380 --> 19:01.709
as soon as we get
to Seattle Pres.

19:01.710 --> 19:04.539
My last words to him
were "Okie dokie."

19:04.540 --> 19:08.500
"Okie dokie" can't be the last
words I ever say to him.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.579
Lucas Ripley.

19:11.580 --> 19:12.500
I'm his sister.

19:12.501 --> 19:13.999
Jennifer?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.169
Vic. Jennifer.

19:15.170 --> 19:16.829
Thank God, a familiar face.

19:16.830 --> 19:19.499
Lucas texted me
that he was at Grey-Sloan,

19:19.500 --> 19:21.749
but then he checked himself out,
and now he's here.

19:21.750 --> 19:22.879
I just... I-I don't understand.

19:22.880 --> 19:24.499
Why in the world
would he do that?

19:24.500 --> 19:25.999
God, it's, um...

19:26.000 --> 19:28.670
Jennifer, I am so sorry.
He did it because of me.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.209
My God, I can't...
I can't breathe.

19:34.210 --> 19:35.829
What?

19:35.830 --> 19:37.999
I'm just, - I'm just happy
you two like each other.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.169
What's not to like?

19:39.170 --> 19:41.329
Clearly.

19:41.330 --> 19:44.000
God. I got to scoot, but, um...

19:45.420 --> 19:47.499
You guys should both fly up
for a weekend visit.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.709
What about the weekend of the 27th?
I'd love to.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.619
Um... I...
Can we pick another weekend?

19:51.620 --> 19:53.539
We got the smoke-jumping
thing on the 27th. Yeah.

19:53.540 --> 19:54.579
Shoot, that's right.

19:54.580 --> 19:56.379
Smoke jumping?
That just sounds...

19:56.380 --> 19:57.749
No, it's the biggest rush.

19:57.750 --> 19:59.749
Literally jumping out of planes.
Over and over and over.

19:59.750 --> 20:01.879
It's... Well, I was gonna
say that it sounds,

20:01.880 --> 20:03.459
like, really dangerous.

20:03.460 --> 20:04.879
No, I mean, well, they don't...

20:04.880 --> 20:06.879
They don't start by letting
you jump out of planes.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.879
You actually begin by jumping
out of these big towers.

20:08.880 --> 20:11.249
I found this training facility
with really high safety ratings.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.289
So it w... it was your idea.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.040
She has all the best ones.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.289
Okay. Another weekend, then.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.879
Yeah.

20:19.880 --> 20:20.959
It was so nice to meet you.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.380
It was so nice to meet you, too.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.250
Okay. Bye.

20:28.790 --> 20:30.250
- Bye!
- Bye!

20:31.790 --> 20:33.999
I told you she'd like me.
She loves you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.080
Yeah.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.999
Lucas is here because of you?

20:38.000 --> 20:39.169
Jennifer.

20:39.170 --> 20:40.579
Lucas is here because
of his heart

20:40.580 --> 20:42.289
and a possible exposure
to, um...

20:42.290 --> 20:44.669
Robert. Hi. Hey.

20:44.670 --> 20:45.959
Your brother was looking for me,

20:45.960 --> 20:47.959
and I wasn't, um...
I wasn't answering my phone.

20:47.960 --> 20:49.499
I'm sorry,
I'm just really confused.

20:49.500 --> 20:50.749
Why wouldn't you talk to him?

20:50.750 --> 20:54.119
Well, there's a few things
in play here.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.289
Are you not telling me
everything

20:56.290 --> 20:58.919
because your co-workers are here
and you two are a secret?

20:58.920 --> 21:00.749
Because this is his health
we're talking about... No.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.249
No, no, no.
That is not... That is...

21:02.250 --> 21:03.579
They know about us.

21:03.580 --> 21:05.919
Then can you please explain
to me why my brother

21:05.920 --> 21:08.459
would risk his life
and leave his doctor's care

21:08.460 --> 21:10.579
because you couldn't be bothered
to answer your phone?

21:10.580 --> 21:13.499
I have an update
on Chief Ripley.

21:13.500 --> 21:15.329
Yes. Yes.

21:15.330 --> 21:16.999
Um, if you're looking for
family to update,

21:17.000 --> 21:17.960
I'm his sister.

21:17.961 --> 21:19.669
We're his family, too.

21:19.670 --> 21:20.999
Vic is. I'm sorry.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.459
This is a lot
to take in right now,

21:22.460 --> 21:25.120
and I feel like
I need to do this alone.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.709
I'm sorry, Vic.

21:30.710 --> 21:34.999
Updates are technically
just for family members.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.290
Right, okay. Okay.

21:44.290 --> 21:47.119
Miranda. Hey, um, look,

21:47.120 --> 21:49.789
I... I know you're in surgery

21:49.790 --> 21:53.169
and alive and well
and saving lives,

21:53.170 --> 21:55.249
just like you should be.

21:55.250 --> 21:57.169
But...

21:57.170 --> 22:01.209
I am at Seattle Pres right now,

22:01.210 --> 22:03.379
actually, you know,
where you were when you...

22:03.380 --> 22:07.499
You know, when you
had your heart attack.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.499
Um...

22:09.500 --> 22:10.709
Um, I'm walking these halls

22:10.710 --> 22:13.040
and remembering that day, and...

22:18.330 --> 22:21.499
Look, anyway, um, I guess
I just really wanted to tell you

22:21.500 --> 22:24.670
how happy I am you're alive.

22:28.750 --> 22:31.749
I'll... I'll see you at home.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.580
Love you.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.959
You have to understand.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.119
When Jen and Luke
lost their parents,

22:39.120 --> 22:41.209
Luke was in college,
but she was just a kid.

22:41.210 --> 22:43.459
When you're so young
and that happens,

22:43.460 --> 22:45.119
it shapes you.

22:45.120 --> 22:48.039
In an instant, Luke became
her parents and her brother...

22:48.040 --> 22:49.379
Everything.

22:49.380 --> 22:51.880
She's not at her best right now,
is all I'm saying.

22:53.620 --> 22:54.959
Just dropped Gwen off at Psych.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.119
She seems to be doing better.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.579
Hold on, Vic.
What are you doing in here?

22:58.580 --> 23:01.459
Ripley's sister's pulling
the family-only card.

23:01.460 --> 23:03.619
Because of HIPAA? Now?

23:03.620 --> 23:06.539
She can't do that. She can.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.749
And she is. I mean, I'm...

23:08.750 --> 23:10.209
Family only.
That's the rule, right?

23:10.210 --> 23:12.709
And I'm not family.

23:12.710 --> 23:15.079
I'm not his fiancée. I'm nobody!

23:15.080 --> 23:16.919
No, you know what?
I'm worse than nobody,

23:16.920 --> 23:18.119
because if I had just
answered my phone,

23:18.120 --> 23:19.080
then he wouldn't
have left Grey-Sloan,

23:19.081 --> 23:20.249
and why would he do that?
Why would...

23:20.250 --> 23:21.250
If I had just answered my phone.

23:21.251 --> 23:22.789
If I just...

23:22.790 --> 23:24.749
If I just answered my phone and
picked up... No. Vic! Hey! Vic!

23:24.750 --> 23:26.079
You were saving a woman's life.

23:26.080 --> 23:29.119
You get to feel zero guilt
about that, okay?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.919
You should be in there
with Ripley right now.

23:30.920 --> 23:32.579
You want me to go hunt down
Dr. Pierce for you?

23:32.580 --> 23:34.080
'Cause I will.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.079
Orderly to OR nine.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.960
Orderly to OR nine.

23:43.460 --> 23:45.459
Vic, come on.
I just need some space.

23:45.460 --> 23:47.079
I want to know what's
going on with Lucas.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.999
Even I don't know
what's going on.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.749
I mean, Dr. Pierce
barely said a word

23:50.750 --> 23:52.579
before he had a coughing attack
or something,

23:52.580 --> 23:53.919
and then she ran
to go treat him.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.579
Okay, well, we go find her.
We go do something.

23:56.580 --> 23:58.749
Wow. You are just like him.

23:58.750 --> 24:01.709
I mean, you both just
barrel ahead, no matter what.

24:01.710 --> 24:02.829
I'm gonna go out on a limb

24:02.830 --> 24:06.169
and guess that's what
landed him in here, right?

24:06.170 --> 24:08.119
That's...
I mean, that's our job.

24:08.120 --> 24:10.119
When Lucas told me that
he started dating someone,

24:10.120 --> 24:12.959
I just thought,
"Please let it be a lawyer"

24:12.960 --> 24:14.459
or an architect, an engineer...

24:14.460 --> 24:16.879
Someone who just has
a nice desk job

24:16.880 --> 24:20.539
"who entices him to play nice
at a desk."

24:20.540 --> 24:22.619
But you entice him
to risk things.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.959
I mean, you spend your weekends
jumping out of planes.

24:24.960 --> 24:27.379
Excuse me.

24:27.380 --> 24:29.959
I'm afraid things
have escalated.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.460
Um... okay.

24:35.790 --> 24:37.710
Okay. Okay.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.209
Did you seen the Chief?

24:48.210 --> 24:50.169
- What did Pierce say?
- Did you get an update?

24:50.170 --> 24:51.379
What's wrong?

24:51.380 --> 24:52.999
Hey, Vic.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.709
Vic. What's wrong?

24:54.710 --> 24:56.999
Is it his sister?
Did she say something?

24:57.000 --> 24:59.749
Hey. Vic. Look at me.

24:59.750 --> 25:02.330
I'm gonna take you somewhere,
okay?

25:07.000 --> 25:09.079
Here. Perfect.

25:09.080 --> 25:10.209
What is this?

25:10.210 --> 25:11.829
This is a yelling closet

25:11.830 --> 25:13.079
or a crying closet

25:13.080 --> 25:14.829
or a whatever-
you-need-to-do closet.

25:14.830 --> 25:16.669
Go on in. I'll be right here.

25:16.670 --> 25:17.919
I don't...
I don't think I need...

25:17.920 --> 25:20.080
Yes, you do.

25:42.710 --> 25:45.119
Just so that you're aware,
your brother has been asking

25:45.120 --> 25:46.879
for Victoria Hughes
since the moment he arrived

25:46.880 --> 25:48.619
as my patient.

25:48.620 --> 25:51.709
All he's wanted
is to talk to her,

25:51.710 --> 25:53.959
to accept her proposal.

25:53.960 --> 25:55.379
So in my professional,

25:55.380 --> 25:58.039
not to mention personal,
opinion... Um, wait.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.749
As in marriage?

25:59.750 --> 26:00.959
Yeah.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.250
Just before he collapsed.
You didn't know?

26:05.330 --> 26:07.290
I bet that made him
really happy.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.459
My... I... I'm so sorry.

26:13.460 --> 26:15.619
Yes, please. Um, can...

26:15.620 --> 26:17.620
Can you go get her? Yes.

26:19.290 --> 26:20.419
Hughes!

26:20.420 --> 26:22.120
Have you seen Hughes? Yes...

26:23.420 --> 26:24.960
Yelling closet.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.079
Is he...

26:37.080 --> 26:38.579
What's going on?

26:38.580 --> 26:41.079
We're supplementing his
breathing with extra oxygen,

26:41.080 --> 26:44.669
but his body isn't responding
the way that we'd hoped.

26:44.670 --> 26:47.209
The acid exposure is disrupting
his calcium levels,

26:47.210 --> 26:49.119
causing his lungs
to fill with fluid.

26:49.120 --> 26:51.289
Can't you just give him
more calcium?

26:51.290 --> 26:54.669
It doesn't work like that,
unfortunately.

26:54.670 --> 26:57.169
And it's already taking
a heavy toll on his organs.

26:57.170 --> 26:58.789
I'm sorry, you're...

26:58.790 --> 27:02.289
But you're like
a-a medical superhero.

27:02.290 --> 27:04.289
Right? There must be
something you can do.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.959
If I could work
some sort of miracle

27:05.960 --> 27:10.619
and scoop out every last
molecule of poison, I would,

27:10.620 --> 27:13.789
but I'm afraid I'm...

27:13.790 --> 27:15.620
powerless here.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.209
So...

27:19.210 --> 27:20.620
he's gonna die.

27:24.380 --> 27:27.999
Right now, he's comfortable.

27:28.000 --> 27:30.749
He's been very clear
about being DNR and DNI.

27:30.750 --> 27:34.329
He does not want to be
resuscitated or intubated.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.250
He wants to go on his own terms.

27:39.670 --> 27:42.500
But now is the best time
to say your goodbyes.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.539
There you two are.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.579
Let's go. Seattle Pres.
Now. Sir?

27:53.580 --> 27:55.669
Chief Ripley's been exposed.
Finish dressing.

27:55.670 --> 27:57.379
We'll get checked while
we're at the hospital.

27:57.380 --> 27:59.669
Are either of you symptomatic?
Runny nose, cough?

27:59.670 --> 28:01.039
- No.
- We're fine.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.329
But the Chief?

28:02.330 --> 28:05.250
All any of us can do at this
point is show up for him.

28:24.710 --> 28:26.620
There's a lot of people
out there.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.379
Word's out the Chief's down.

28:30.380 --> 28:32.580
The department is going
to come sit vigil.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.919
Vic...

28:54.920 --> 28:56.789
If you want to go sit with him,

28:56.790 --> 28:58.000
now's the time.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.829
Somebody else go. I can't.

29:14.830 --> 29:16.460
I'm not ready. I can't.

29:18.420 --> 29:19.920
It's okay.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.620
Still waiting for
that beer you owe me.

29:45.540 --> 29:49.670
Yeah, this isn't a beer
kind of establishment.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.459
I wasted so...

30:09.460 --> 30:11.789
So much time
being angry with you.

30:11.790 --> 30:13.830
You don't need
to apologize, Sully.

30:25.670 --> 30:27.169
Did she listen to my messages?

30:27.170 --> 30:28.499
Does she know
I wasn't trying to...

30:28.500 --> 30:31.829
She knows everything
she needs to know.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.710
She knows that this is...

30:35.670 --> 30:37.000
goodbye.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.500
She's not ready to say it.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.709
I'm not either.

30:46.710 --> 30:48.080
Then don't.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.669
Yeah. I'll just...

30:51.670 --> 30:53.750
I'll just say, um...

30:56.620 --> 30:58.080
we're good.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.380
I'm glad.

31:06.790 --> 31:09.709
Alright.

31:09.710 --> 31:11.790
Alright.

31:21.210 --> 31:23.209
Sully.

31:23.210 --> 31:24.579
Yeah?

31:24.580 --> 31:26.460
Please, will you send her in?

31:35.080 --> 31:36.250
Hughes.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.120
The Chief is asking for Vic?

31:53.790 --> 31:55.919
Hey.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.419
It's time. Okay?

31:57.420 --> 31:58.750
Before it's too late.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.080
I can't. I can't move.

32:13.750 --> 32:15.250
Just focus on me.

33:06.380 --> 33:09.830
Wait.

33:11.670 --> 33:15.000
You look great.

33:39.880 --> 33:42.079
Easy on the morphine, please.

33:42.080 --> 33:44.579
You'll feel more pain
without it.

33:44.580 --> 33:46.460
I'll be more alert, too.
I can...

33:47.880 --> 33:49.580
I can handle the pain.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.040
I'll be outside if you need me.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.920
I called.

34:01.080 --> 34:03.079
I know.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.419
I tried to get to the diner.

34:04.420 --> 34:05.540
I know.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.960
The treatments, they
didn't... I know.

34:19.380 --> 34:20.708
Hughes and the Chief?

34:20.710 --> 34:21.879
How long has that been going on?

34:21.880 --> 34:23.079
That's enough.

34:23.080 --> 34:24.540
Now is not the time.

34:38.960 --> 34:40.420
How long has that been going on?

34:46.750 --> 34:48.119
So...

34:48.120 --> 34:50.958
the secret's out, I guess.

34:50.960 --> 34:52.418
Yeah.

34:52.420 --> 34:54.079
I guess we can...

34:54.080 --> 34:56.330
We can finally take
that vacation?

34:58.250 --> 34:59.749
Aspen?

34:59.750 --> 35:01.670
No. Definitely Hawaii.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.919
I'm there right now.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.249
In a bikini.

35:06.250 --> 35:08.289
Lucky you.

35:08.290 --> 35:09.620
Lucky me.

35:12.830 --> 35:14.960
Our toes are in the sand.

35:17.460 --> 35:19.119
The sun's warming our skin.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.710
Not a care in the world.

35:22.710 --> 35:24.459
Wait, actually,

35:24.460 --> 35:25.959
I do have a care.
I have a big care.

35:25.960 --> 35:28.670
Sand has now fully gone
the wrong way up my suit.

35:37.790 --> 35:38.959
I'm just... I'm gonna...

35:38.960 --> 35:41.790
I'm gonna turn these...
Turn these off.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.999
I told you I would be there.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.709
I wanted to be there.

35:57.710 --> 36:01.329
Please don't work yourself up
right now, okay?

36:01.330 --> 36:03.170
I owe you an answer.

36:06.670 --> 36:09.000
It's yes, Victoria.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.540
Of course it's yes.

36:16.670 --> 36:20.829
That's a very wise
decision, obviously.

36:20.830 --> 36:23.499
We can do it right now. Can't...

36:23.500 --> 36:26.080
Can't we get a chaplain
or somebody in here?

36:30.040 --> 36:31.620
You know what? I, um...

36:33.880 --> 36:36.540
I'd just
like to have this moment.

36:38.540 --> 36:40.789
With you, right now, okay?

36:40.790 --> 36:41.959
Just us.

36:41.960 --> 36:43.709
This was supposed to be
our beginning.

36:43.710 --> 36:44.789
I'm...

36:44.790 --> 36:46.579
I messed it all up. No.

36:46.580 --> 36:50.290
I was bringing you flowers.
You didn't mess anything up.

36:58.290 --> 37:01.710
Hey, you did something new
with your hair.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.919
Yeah.

37:05.920 --> 37:08.710
You're so beautiful.

37:15.920 --> 37:19.500
I was really ready to spend
the rest of my life with you...

37:21.750 --> 37:23.460
Lucas Ripley.

37:24.790 --> 37:27.579
At least...

37:27.580 --> 37:30.919
I get to spend
the rest of mine...

37:30.920 --> 37:32.620
with you.

38:28.040 --> 38:31.290
Time of death, 1743.

39:09.420 --> 39:11.079
When a Fire Chief dies,

39:11.080 --> 39:14.329
the department spares no expense
on the funeral.

39:14.330 --> 39:17.379
Vehicle options range
from a basic vehicle

39:17.380 --> 39:19.710
to a fire engine caisson.

39:20.790 --> 39:23.419
Bagpipers are common.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.879
The bell service is a special
tradition that we some...

39:25.880 --> 39:27.579
All of it.

39:27.580 --> 39:29.249
He'd want all of it.
He should have it all.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.380
Excuse me.

40:50.290 --> 40:53.209
Semper Paratus. "Always Ready."

40:53.210 --> 40:55.879
What it really means
is that we're always ready

40:55.880 --> 40:58.289
to lose a member of our family.

40:58.290 --> 41:00.829
But when it's time
to face that emptiness,

41:00.830 --> 41:04.329
when you realize you'll
never see that face again,

41:04.330 --> 41:08.039
touch that skin,
feel that warmth,

41:08.040 --> 41:10.120
listen to that heartbeat...

41:12.460 --> 41:15.879
What if you get sick?
I could be contagious.

41:15.880 --> 41:17.290
You are.

41:27.920 --> 41:31.329
Victoria Hughes...

41:31.330 --> 41:33.420
I love you.

41:35.580 --> 41:38.170
Damn it. I love you, too.

41:42.170 --> 41:44.830
Okay, did I just say... Yes.

41:47.920 --> 41:49.420
I love you.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.499
Yeah, okay.

41:56.500 --> 41:58.879
It's time to stop talking now.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.999
It's late.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.709
I'm wide awake.

42:03.710 --> 42:05.620
Just go to sleep.

42:09.790 --> 42:13.039
The question is...

42:13.040 --> 42:15.290
are we ever really ready?
