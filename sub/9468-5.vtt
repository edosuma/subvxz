00:50.695 --> 00:52.780
This is crazy, JR!

00:52.821 --> 00:56.451
I know what you're thinking,
but Shelley deserves a chance.

01:00.854 --> 01:05.376
- What condition's the body in?
- Her name is Shelley. Shelley!

02:24.544 --> 02:27.584
There's a rumor going around
that you're a werewolf.

02:27.626 --> 02:29.919
Well, are you?

02:29.961 --> 02:33.674
What do you think?

02:35.843 --> 02:39.971
Take two. What are you doing
with my cousin Roman?

02:40.013 --> 02:42.265
What needs to be done.

02:42.307 --> 02:45.225
You do know we're
in high school

02:45.268 --> 02:47.270
and not a Clint Eastwood movie.

02:49.938 --> 02:53.401
You ever seen <i>High Plains Drifter?</i>

02:56.153 --> 02:58.864
I'm just glad the two of you
are getting along.

02:58.906 --> 03:02.536
Roman doesn't
have many friends.

03:05.515 --> 03:07.343
Excuse me.

03:09.451 --> 03:11.919
You that sure
I'm not contagious? Ooh.

03:18.176 --> 03:22.639
Just promise me you'll keep
him from doing something stupid.

03:22.681 --> 03:25.599
Since when did I become
the designated driver?

03:27.602 --> 03:29.563
Please.

03:29.604 --> 03:31.496
All right, shit, fine.

03:31.616 --> 03:34.526
I promise.

03:34.568 --> 03:36.902
Now that we're talking turkey
though, what can you tell me

03:36.944 --> 03:39.531
- about Roman's mom?
- Aunt Olivia?

03:39.573 --> 03:41.742
- Why?
- References.

03:41.783 --> 03:46.747
- In case she asks for a loan.
- Yeah, I'll bet. Hmm.

03:46.788 --> 03:50.082
Well, as the story goes,
Roman's dad was touring

03:50.123 --> 03:52.878
biomedical facilities in England
when he first met Olivia.

03:52.919 --> 03:55.254
Further reports indicate

03:55.295 --> 03:57.257
that he was bedazzled
right from the start.

03:57.298 --> 04:00.093
Whoa. Bedazzled? People
actually use that world?

04:00.134 --> 04:03.263
Some people do.

04:05.265 --> 04:09.185
What else? On the day that
they buried her husband,

04:09.227 --> 04:12.230
the local paper described
my aunt as the most beautiful

04:12.272 --> 04:14.691
and despised woman

04:14.733 --> 04:16.692
in Hemlock Grove.

04:16.733 --> 04:20.320
Hmm. And they say
journalism is dead.

04:20.362 --> 04:23.115
Prize?

04:23.156 --> 04:26.326
That's creepy.

04:30.163 --> 04:32.750
It actually means good luck.

04:37.379 --> 04:40.090
Come on. Don't be
such a fucking girl!

05:02.572 --> 05:05.908
Dr. Chasseur.

05:05.950 --> 05:08.536
Dr. Pryce.

05:08.577 --> 05:12.372
Thank you for seeing me.
I know you must be very busy.

05:12.414 --> 05:16.001
I saw the preparations
downstairs. You're celebrating

05:16.042 --> 05:19.045
- the institute's 20th anniversary?
- Yes, tomorrow's festivities.

05:19.087 --> 05:21.048
An ode to our late founder,

05:21.089 --> 05:23.884
orchestrated by Mrs. Godfrey
and her son.

05:26.596 --> 05:28.555
Intrigued?

05:28.597 --> 05:30.766
Artificial, isn't it?

05:30.808 --> 05:33.394
One of your creations?

05:33.435 --> 05:35.938
Mmm, and a puzzle.

05:35.980 --> 05:37.940
Every test indicates

05:37.983 --> 05:40.359
the scent is genetically
identical to the real flower.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.947
Still, the bees have
yet to be convinced.

05:43.988 --> 05:46.448
Ever consider
planting a garden?

05:46.490 --> 05:50.703
It's not, as they say,
in my job description.

05:50.745 --> 05:54.456
You're not planning on recording
our conversation, are you, Doctor?

05:54.498 --> 05:56.792
Hadn't planned on it, no.

05:59.252 --> 06:02.548
I am.
Just so you know.

06:04.550 --> 06:07.051
And, please, call me Johann.

06:07.093 --> 06:10.556
So what is it exactly
that you do here, Johann?

06:10.597 --> 06:12.641
Sly devil, pretending
you don't know.

06:12.683 --> 06:14.769
I admit I did some reading.

06:14.810 --> 06:17.479
Your area of specialization
is quite contentious.

06:17.521 --> 06:21.108
I was hoping I could convince you to amplify
on the premise of your first published paper.

06:21.149 --> 06:23.276
The one colloquially
referred to

06:23.318 --> 06:25.779
as "better reincarnation
through chemistry?"

06:25.822 --> 06:28.240
- Mm-hmm.
- It's all theoretical.

06:28.281 --> 06:30.325
If one took
an existing but inanimate

06:30.367 --> 06:32.411
- carbon-based structure--
- A corpse.

06:32.452 --> 06:34.568
That was still
in a relatively labile situation.

06:34.688 --> 06:35.576
A baby's corpse.

06:35.697 --> 06:39.301
One might weave into the existing
structure the element of phosphorous,

06:39.421 --> 06:42.046
forming chain molecules
that could support life...

06:43.548 --> 06:47.217
...all of which raises
one overriding question:

06:49.093 --> 06:52.138
How is this of any importance

06:52.180 --> 06:55.017
to the US Fish
and Wildlife Service?

06:58.020 --> 07:01.024
Johann, is there any chance any of your
test animals could have gotten out,

07:01.065 --> 07:02.983
any of your human subjects?

07:07.195 --> 07:09.949
None whatsoever.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.911
And there I thought
I'd cracked the case.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.084
You wouldn't happen to have any
thoughts on our demon dog, would you?

07:19.165 --> 07:22.461
There is one thing, Doctor.

07:22.502 --> 07:25.632
Considering the parallels
between the two killings,

07:25.673 --> 07:28.550
I'm convinced this was
the premeditated act

07:28.592 --> 07:30.844
of a pathological
sexual predator.

07:31.870 --> 07:34.382
Didn't you say you believed
an animal was responsible?

07:34.502 --> 07:36.115
Yes, I did.

07:36.725 --> 07:40.646
Because no person could do what was
done to those bodies, not barehanded.

07:51.615 --> 07:54.576
Owing to an abnormality
with my adrenal glands,

07:54.618 --> 07:57.079
I suffer from what is
clinically described

07:57.121 --> 07:59.414
as hysterical strength.

07:59.456 --> 08:02.876
The type of physical feats induced
by fight-or-flight mode are...

08:02.918 --> 08:06.463
simply my mode.

08:06.505 --> 08:08.465
You do know that technically

08:08.507 --> 08:11.468
this makes you a suspect.

08:13.471 --> 08:15.931
- Dr. Chasseur.
- Clementine.

08:15.973 --> 08:18.183
Clementine, then.

08:18.224 --> 08:22.146
You should know the Godfreys are very
protective of the institute's fortunes.

08:22.187 --> 08:25.816
- And?
- Tread lightly and with certainty.

08:25.858 --> 08:30.154
It's been my experience that the
bees don't land on them either.

09:28.629 --> 09:30.590
Yes?

09:33.217 --> 09:35.802
Nothing more to say
to your old friend?

09:35.845 --> 09:38.680
What an unexpected surprise.

09:38.722 --> 09:40.933
[As surprises should be.]

09:40.975 --> 09:44.853
I'm calling because,
all assurances to the contrary,

09:44.895 --> 09:48.732
I'm hearing that
you're still drinking.

09:53.071 --> 09:55.115
And if I said it wasn't true?

09:57.116 --> 10:00.035
Then I'd believe you...

10:00.077 --> 10:03.914
until I had reason
to think otherwise.

10:03.956 --> 10:07.500
Well, then you have
your answer.

10:09.502 --> 10:11.463
Anything else?

10:11.504 --> 10:15.050
Just that you've always been

10:15.092 --> 10:17.677
my favorite, Clementine.

10:41.660 --> 10:45.789
Get your damn hands off me!
Son of a bitch!

10:45.831 --> 10:48.542
- Get the goddamn door!
- Fuck you, man!

10:48.583 --> 10:50.961
Fuck you!

10:51.004 --> 10:54.090
Piece of shit!

10:54.131 --> 10:56.591
I'll bite it off at the knuckle.

11:08.520 --> 11:12.149
Look at us, a couple wily
desperados thrown together by fate.

11:12.192 --> 11:15.110
Fucking <i>mentira.</i>

11:15.153 --> 11:18.114
INS men picked me up
two days ago for no reason.

11:18.155 --> 11:21.158
- Right.
- I have a green card,

11:21.201 --> 11:24.161
I'm legal, I swear,
but no one will listen.

11:26.496 --> 11:28.832
I can't have my baby here.

11:28.875 --> 11:33.045
Go ahead, honey.
Cry if it makes you happy.

11:35.881 --> 11:38.591
God does not want us
to be happy.

11:38.634 --> 11:40.845
He wants us to be strong.

12:12.793 --> 12:16.838
Sacred heart of Jesus,
please pray for me.

12:16.880 --> 12:20.509
St. Jude, helper of the
hopeless, please pray for me.

12:20.550 --> 12:24.179
St. Jude, worker of miracles,
please pray for me.

12:24.221 --> 12:27.766
Please pray for me.
Please pray for me.

12:27.807 --> 12:30.185
Pray for me.

13:24.323 --> 13:26.326
I heard about what happened
to you in the woods.

13:26.366 --> 13:28.285
I'm sorry.

13:28.327 --> 13:31.121
Why would you be sorry?

13:31.163 --> 13:33.957
Because I am.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.252
Are you done?

13:39.463 --> 13:41.466
I guess so.

13:45.470 --> 13:48.639
You won't get away
with it, you know?

14:33.600 --> 14:37.603
Roman.

14:39.605 --> 14:41.649
We have a guest.

14:41.692 --> 14:44.069
Uh, Shelley darling,
would you go up to your room?

14:48.908 --> 14:50.867
What's the problem?

14:50.909 --> 14:53.828
Franklin Hernandez.

14:56.122 --> 14:59.000
Go on, officer.

14:59.043 --> 15:03.297
It appears some deviants - and by some I
mean two, given the footprints we found -

15:03.338 --> 15:05.841
got down and dirty at
the cemetery last night.

15:05.882 --> 15:10.303
- Some kind of prank?
- If you consider digging up

15:10.346 --> 15:13.973
Lisa Willoughby's corpse and gutting her like
a fish a prank, yes, I guess it was a prank.

15:14.015 --> 15:17.437
So who's Hernandez?
Is he a suspect or...?

15:17.477 --> 15:19.438
He is our gardener.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.731
Who's been in the hospital
for the last three weeks.

15:21.774 --> 15:24.025
We retrieved this
from the hole.

15:25.985 --> 15:29.115
Any idea how a shovel from your
property wound up near an open grave?

15:29.155 --> 15:31.741
Roman?

15:31.783 --> 15:34.870
Maybe somebody stole it.

15:36.371 --> 15:38.624
Stole your gardener's shovel?

15:38.664 --> 15:40.793
This shovel?

15:40.833 --> 15:42.794
Yeah.

15:42.836 --> 15:46.048
Well, in case you're interested,
there is a $10,000 reward.

15:46.090 --> 15:48.216
Which I've just
offered to double.

15:48.259 --> 15:52.513
Yeah. Like I said,
you know...

15:55.307 --> 15:58.059
OK.

15:58.101 --> 16:00.228
Thank you for your help,
Mrs. Godfrey.

16:00.270 --> 16:03.482
- My pleasure.
- I'll be seeing you, kid.

16:08.111 --> 16:10.780
You did this.

16:10.822 --> 16:13.908
You and that gypsy scum,
choosing a moment

16:13.951 --> 16:17.120
- you knew would hurt me most.
- What?

16:17.163 --> 16:20.124
Tomorrow's gala for your father.
Don't pretend you've forgotten.

16:20.165 --> 16:22.750
- Jesus.
- Do you hate me so much

16:22.793 --> 16:26.254
that you would risk this
family's public humiliation?

16:26.297 --> 16:28.966
What if I told you that
what I'm doing is important?

16:29.007 --> 16:32.927
That it is quite possibly
the most important--

16:32.970 --> 16:36.264
Be quiet.

16:36.307 --> 16:39.184
I can't bear the sound of you.

16:42.437 --> 16:45.607
Another visit from the police and
I will collect the reward myself.

16:47.317 --> 16:49.569
Nod if you understand.

16:52.656 --> 16:54.949
Tomorrow, guests
arrive at eight.

16:54.991 --> 16:57.452
You will be prompt,
properly dressed

16:57.495 --> 17:01.414
and attentive
to our guests. Nod!

17:05.836 --> 17:08.797
Now stay out of my sight.

17:18.391 --> 17:21.101
So, did you and my cousin
have a pleasant lunch?

17:21.143 --> 17:23.103
Huh?

17:23.144 --> 17:27.733
Nutrition! They don't
call it lunch anymore.

17:29.735 --> 17:32.821
Roman! Hey!

17:32.863 --> 17:34.865
She pities me.

17:36.325 --> 17:39.453
Yeah, she's all heart.

17:59.806 --> 18:02.142
You never told me
why you're here.

18:13.278 --> 18:16.365
Why don't you talk to me?

18:34.173 --> 18:37.052
So you're in the military.

18:39.846 --> 18:42.475
It means you have people,

18:42.516 --> 18:45.894
someone who cares about you.

18:52.901 --> 18:57.030
There's a brother, Michael,

18:57.072 --> 18:59.575
a Marine like me,

18:59.617 --> 19:01.868
another 10 out of 10
on the "fucked up" scale.

19:11.420 --> 19:13.839
Shit!

19:13.880 --> 19:16.801
Why are you doing that?

19:20.721 --> 19:23.432
I'm not here on some bullshit
drunk and disorderly.

19:23.474 --> 19:26.519
Rednecks are gonna
bury my black ass

19:26.560 --> 19:30.980
just as surely as
they're gonna let you rot.

19:33.400 --> 19:36.320
It's a weapon.

19:38.614 --> 19:41.450
Not yet.

19:41.492 --> 19:45.078
Take me with you when you go.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.624
Please. I'll do
anything you ask.

19:48.666 --> 19:52.919
I just can't have my baby here.

19:52.961 --> 19:56.256
Ride my coattails?

19:58.258 --> 20:01.679
Work the edge.
Not the point.

20:05.974 --> 20:08.728
Not the point.

20:19.780 --> 20:21.740
Thank you, Chasseur.

20:21.782 --> 20:25.703
Clementine.

20:25.745 --> 20:29.540
Thank you, Clementine.

20:52.521 --> 20:55.858
Peter! Hi. Muah.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.569
Come in. I'll just be a second.

20:58.611 --> 21:02.155
Now, I want you to find time
every day to be mindful

21:02.197 --> 21:05.701
of the love and nourishment
flowing from your Manipura, OK?

21:05.743 --> 21:07.703
And lay off the refined sugars.

21:07.745 --> 21:10.748
- It messes with your metabolism.
- All right, thank you.

21:12.734 --> 21:15.381
- Another happy customer?
- Crushed a couple blue pills in his tea.

21:15.501 --> 21:17.316
The sugar thing was
just common sense.

21:17.436 --> 21:19.157
Like when your doctor
tells you to stop smoking.

21:19.277 --> 21:20.513
One size fits all.

21:20.633 --> 21:23.176
Hi!

21:23.218 --> 21:25.763
This is my cousin,
Destiny Rumancek.

21:25.805 --> 21:28.891
I'm Roman.

21:28.932 --> 21:31.017
See anything interesting?

21:31.059 --> 21:33.312
Hmm.

21:33.353 --> 21:35.773
You gentlemen have
something for me?

21:39.234 --> 21:41.111
Ooh! Orangies.

21:41.153 --> 21:45.157
What a sweetie.

21:47.576 --> 21:51.204
Just tell me why
this is better than running.

21:51.246 --> 21:53.958
Fucked if I can, D.

21:53.999 --> 21:56.669
Oh, Peter.

21:59.254 --> 22:02.758
Mmm.

22:02.800 --> 22:05.469
Wah!

22:21.944 --> 22:24.488
Hello, handsome.

22:33.831 --> 22:37.584
- Sorry, buddy. <i>Bon appÃ©tit. </i>
- How long is this gonna take?

22:37.626 --> 22:39.920
Better let it sit overnight
for good measure.

22:39.961 --> 22:42.548
We'll need some tequila.

22:42.589 --> 22:45.342
- Is that part of it?
- No.

22:45.384 --> 22:48.637
Um, something in a pretty
bottle. Silver's good.

22:48.679 --> 22:51.849
You got it.

22:58.313 --> 23:00.691
Why didn't she tell me
what she saw in my palm?

23:00.733 --> 23:03.360
'Cause it doesn't
work like that.

23:03.402 --> 23:07.447
Oh, I didn't realize I had to grease your
whore cousin like the rest of the rubes.

23:07.489 --> 23:11.410
Whore as in, like, literal description.
I'm a fucking feminist.

23:11.451 --> 23:14.830
What you want isn't for sale. Destiny
doesn't trade real magic for money.

23:14.872 --> 23:18.918
She trades everything else.

23:18.959 --> 23:21.628
It's not the same.

23:25.798 --> 23:28.886
Women do what they do.

23:28.928 --> 23:31.764
That's the hell of it.

23:31.805 --> 23:35.559
What?

23:35.601 --> 23:38.062
Women do what they do.

23:38.102 --> 23:40.564
That's the hell of it.

23:42.566 --> 23:44.651
Shee-it.

23:44.692 --> 23:47.528
I think my Manipura
needs nourishment.

23:54.326 --> 23:56.580
That's ridiculous.

24:15.015 --> 24:19.185
Ah, Francis.
Good morning.

24:19.227 --> 24:21.187
Good morning my ass.

24:21.229 --> 24:23.607
You got me all fucked up.

24:23.649 --> 24:26.567
It's just a sedative.
I'm told you had a bad night.

24:26.610 --> 24:28.903
I don't want anyone else

24:28.946 --> 24:31.155
helping me sleep.

24:31.197 --> 24:33.867
Right.

24:35.995 --> 24:40.082
Can you tell me anything
more about Ouroboros,

24:40.124 --> 24:43.002
anything that may help us?

24:43.043 --> 24:46.588
That's why they killed us.

24:48.715 --> 24:51.426
Us.

24:51.468 --> 24:53.595
Do you mean there were others?

24:57.850 --> 25:00.602
You don't want to do this.

25:00.644 --> 25:02.604
You don't want to see.

25:04.982 --> 25:07.191
Francis,

25:07.233 --> 25:09.319
I need you to focus.

25:09.361 --> 25:12.614
You know, Ouroboros,
this talk of the dragon.

25:12.656 --> 25:16.785
I can't help you unless
I know what you mean.

25:22.374 --> 25:27.295
Why don't you ask that beady-
eyed little fucker Pryce?

25:36.304 --> 25:39.474
So, where's your extremely
tall upir friend?

25:39.516 --> 25:42.019
He's going to a party
but he, uh,

25:42.061 --> 25:44.269
he expects a full report.

25:44.312 --> 25:46.899
So Inspector Rumancek

25:46.940 --> 25:49.609
- is still on the case?
- Shut up.

25:49.651 --> 25:52.863
Peter, this goes wrong,

25:52.905 --> 25:56.533
Roman goes home to his mom.
You could end up in a cage.

25:59.411 --> 26:03.373
OK.

26:03.415 --> 26:05.876
This can be messy.

26:08.336 --> 26:10.547
Ooh.

26:10.589 --> 26:12.591
Hello.

26:28.774 --> 26:32.986
Ooh.

26:59.012 --> 27:01.014
Now.

27:04.059 --> 27:06.686
OK, whatever you need, ask it
quick because this goes fast.

27:06.728 --> 27:08.980
OK.

27:09.022 --> 27:12.109
Hey, I don't suppose
you're ticklish, huh?

27:12.151 --> 27:14.194
Try it and it'll be
the last thing you ever do.

27:14.236 --> 27:18.073
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

27:50.438 --> 27:52.398
Can you talk?

27:52.440 --> 27:54.567
- Yes.
- What can you tell me?

27:54.609 --> 27:57.070
I hated butterscotch,
was good at shit, liked to sew,

27:57.112 --> 27:58.913
was planning on giving Scott
Buford a blowjob for his birthday

27:59.034 --> 27:59.948
but would have chickened out.

28:00.067 --> 28:02.139
Sorry. What can you tell me
about your death?

28:09.041 --> 28:12.502
I came to Hemlock Grove
because of the invitation.

28:12.544 --> 28:15.130
It was dark. There was no one else there.
I thought that was a part of it and--

28:15.172 --> 28:20.052
- Wait. What invitation?
- Fun, fun, fun.

28:23.971 --> 28:27.351
I parked,

28:27.391 --> 28:29.769
got out, but left my keys
in the car. Ding,

28:29.811 --> 28:31.938
ding, ding.

28:34.482 --> 28:36.567
I was alone, I thought,

28:36.609 --> 28:39.321
but then he was there,

28:39.363 --> 28:41.323
all big and all black - ding,

28:41.365 --> 28:43.950
ding, ding, ding.

28:57.547 --> 28:59.925
I've always had a way with dogs.

28:59.966 --> 29:02.427
I reached out to pet his cheek

29:02.468 --> 29:07.682
and then I saw his eyes,
a horrible yellow.

29:07.724 --> 29:10.727
- Oh, God. It was how he looked at me.
- Looked how?

29:10.769 --> 29:14.480
The helpless way a dog looks at you
when he can't tell you what it needs.

29:36.128 --> 29:38.130
I need to brush my teeth.

29:41.466 --> 29:43.927
This continues the personal
journal of Dr. Johann Pryce.

29:43.969 --> 29:46.012
Full stop.

29:46.054 --> 29:49.515
I met a Dr. Chasseur. Full stop.

29:49.557 --> 29:52.227
She affects an enigmatic
manner - semicolon.

29:52.269 --> 29:54.438
The forest ranger coat, comma,

29:54.479 --> 29:56.689
her guileless manner, comma,

29:56.730 --> 30:00.986
all carefully designed to put
her subjects at ease. Full stop.

30:03.071 --> 30:05.657
So close, comma,

30:05.698 --> 30:07.659
and yet sadly oblivious
to what awaits her

30:07.700 --> 30:10.203
should her inquiries
lead to the Godfreys' door.

30:10.245 --> 30:12.580
Full stop.

30:15.125 --> 30:17.419
Hello, Norman.

30:17.461 --> 30:20.546
- A bit early for this evening's soiree.
- Shut up.

30:20.588 --> 30:22.590
Tell me about
Ouroboros, Johann.

30:22.632 --> 30:25.259
I see.

30:25.302 --> 30:28.554
Can I get you something? Brandy?

30:28.596 --> 30:30.974
- Red Bull?
- Don't.

30:31.016 --> 30:33.643
Yes, Ouroboros.

30:33.685 --> 30:36.521
Of course. One of
our spaghetti projects.

30:36.562 --> 30:39.149
- The hell's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, it's a term

30:39.191 --> 30:41.442
one of the wags in the
laboratory devised to define

30:41.485 --> 30:43.611
our more conceptual efforts,

30:43.653 --> 30:46.781
as in we throw something
against the wall

30:46.823 --> 30:50.618
and see if it sticks. In the
case of Ouroboros, pit vipers.

30:50.660 --> 30:53.913
They possess heat-sensitive
organs called thermoreceptors.

30:53.955 --> 30:57.459
We were studying them to see if
there might be a human application.

30:57.501 --> 30:59.627
For instance, to aid the blind.

30:59.669 --> 31:03.589
Why would the homeless man under my
care be raving about pit vipers?

31:03.631 --> 31:06.301
Oh, this wouldn't be
our Francis Pullman.

31:06.343 --> 31:09.179
Well, yes, he was a volunteer
for one of our drug trials.

31:09.221 --> 31:13.307
Unfortunately, this particular
sedative discovered

31:13.350 --> 31:16.978
could cause mild
hallucinogenic effects.

31:17.019 --> 31:19.730
In spaghetti terms,
it did not stick.

31:19.772 --> 31:22.734
None of that explains why
both Pullman and my niece

31:22.775 --> 31:25.320
reference something
they call the dragon.

31:25.362 --> 31:28.490
Well, if you like,
I could show you.

31:34.162 --> 31:37.374
We're just past
clinical microbiology.

31:37.416 --> 31:40.752
The sleep lab is that way.
Sometimes I take Shelley there

31:40.793 --> 31:42.961
to monitor her REM activity

31:43.004 --> 31:45.006
and this.

31:49.219 --> 31:51.221
Sometimes the most
obvious explanation

31:51.263 --> 31:54.224
is the most
obvious explanation.

31:54.266 --> 31:58.978
A clever thief learns
to cover his tracks.

31:59.019 --> 32:01.773
You seem to be under
a great deal of stress.

32:01.814 --> 32:04.088
If you worked for me,
I'd insist you take a vacation.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.949
But you work for me, Pryce.

32:06.069 --> 32:10.282
Which reminds me. You should be receiving
an offer soon from a firm called Lod LLC.

32:13.159 --> 32:15.912
- I'm getting an offer?
- To buy you out.

32:15.954 --> 32:19.874
You've made it abundantly clear you'd
just as soon disavow the whole institute.

32:19.916 --> 32:23.086
Consider it your chance to
relieve yourself of your burden.

32:23.128 --> 32:25.922
My burden, Johann, or yours?

32:25.964 --> 32:27.923
You'd have rather she had died?

32:27.966 --> 32:29.759
Shelley did die.

32:29.801 --> 32:33.054
Your brother understood
the ramifications.

32:33.096 --> 32:36.849
He was a father mourning the death of
his child, and you exploited that.

32:36.891 --> 32:39.018
Would you care to tell our
girl that you see her conception

32:39.060 --> 32:41.019
as the result of
emotional incompetence?

32:41.062 --> 32:43.898
It's the only damn thing
about her that's normal.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.817
Now you understand something.
I have a teenage daughter

32:46.859 --> 32:50.696
I'm taking to the OB/GYN tomorrow and
I'm telling you - don't interrupt!

32:52.324 --> 32:55.743
And I'm telling you now,
if I find evidence

32:55.785 --> 32:58.955
that you had any involvement
in her condition,

32:58.997 --> 33:00.957
I'll have you killed.

33:00.999 --> 33:03.585
Well.

33:03.627 --> 33:06.129
Hmm. Now,

33:06.171 --> 33:08.548
be a good fellow and tell
your friends at Lod

33:08.590 --> 33:10.800
to righteously and rigorously

33:10.842 --> 33:13.553
go fuck themselves.

33:29.027 --> 33:32.238
Of course, comma,
if he had learned anything

33:32.280 --> 33:36.284
during his years within
the gulag of academia,

33:36.326 --> 33:39.829
it was that rational decisions
based upon the premise

33:39.871 --> 33:43.625
that other human beings
were rational agents were,

33:43.667 --> 33:46.503
comma, in fact, comma,

33:46.545 --> 33:48.880
a fucking lie.

33:56.095 --> 33:59.807
Next time maybe
lay off on the tequila.

33:59.849 --> 34:01.809
You better be careful
around this Roman

34:01.851 --> 34:04.229
and his mother.

34:04.269 --> 34:06.855
The little prince has no teeth

34:06.898 --> 34:10.527
and the queen's an actress.

34:10.568 --> 34:12.527
She's just bored.

34:12.570 --> 34:14.530
I saw a conversion

34:14.572 --> 34:17.449
of his fate line and heart line.

34:17.492 --> 34:19.452
Your friend is gonna face
the hardest choice

34:19.494 --> 34:21.454
of his life, and whoever's
in his shadow

34:21.496 --> 34:23.998
is gonna share in
the consequences.

34:24.039 --> 34:26.543
And bored is just one mask.
Who knows how many more

34:26.585 --> 34:30.630
that crazy bitch is
wearing underneath?

34:30.672 --> 34:33.132
Spic and span.

34:33.172 --> 34:35.134
I better get going -

34:35.175 --> 34:38.804
- school night and all.
- Peter,

34:38.846 --> 34:42.056
you remember why Nicolae
was so afraid of the upir?

34:44.561 --> 34:47.855
Never forget what he is, Peter,

34:47.896 --> 34:50.983
especially if he has.

35:04.914 --> 35:08.460
What can you tell me
about angels?

35:14.048 --> 35:18.344
Angels are messengers that
help us better understand God.

35:18.385 --> 35:22.347
Why are you asking me
about angels?

35:22.389 --> 35:26.227
There's this girl at my school.

35:26.269 --> 35:29.564
What is it with you
and crazy girls?

35:40.907 --> 35:43.244
A moment for an old friend?

36:52.938 --> 36:54.898
<i>I understand that you have</i>

36:54.940 --> 36:59.153
a certain confidence
with your Uncle Norman.

36:59.195 --> 37:02.280
I'm not cross with you.
I'm not Olivia.

37:02.322 --> 37:05.492
But there is something I have
to do, something very important

37:05.535 --> 37:08.788
and, by necessity, secret.

37:08.829 --> 37:12.541
Now, I know that
sounds unseemly,

37:12.584 --> 37:15.001
but I ask, have you
ever shown your mother

37:15.043 --> 37:18.338
your poetry?
Exactly.

37:21.008 --> 37:24.262
There's no shame
in hiding some things.

37:26.472 --> 37:28.807
You've done nothing wrong,
glowworm,

37:28.849 --> 37:32.269
but I have to ask you
to repeat nothing

37:32.311 --> 37:34.773
I tell you.

37:34.814 --> 37:37.776
Ouroboros is that important

37:37.817 --> 37:41.237
and that vulnerable.

37:46.617 --> 37:50.037
I am, as always,
in my best girl's debt,

37:50.079 --> 37:52.456
and even more deeply

37:52.498 --> 37:56.126
if you would favor me
with a smile.

38:02.675 --> 38:05.929
Thank you, glowworm.

38:13.269 --> 38:16.564
We should hurry. You promised
we'd be out by tonight.

38:16.606 --> 38:18.398
What are you gonna name it?

38:18.441 --> 38:20.401
Diego,

38:20.443 --> 38:22.987
if it's a boy.

38:23.028 --> 38:24.989
If it's a girl, Leticia,

38:25.030 --> 38:27.240
after my mother.

38:31.621 --> 38:34.916
Thank you.

38:43.132 --> 38:46.385
God wants you to be strong, OK?

38:46.427 --> 38:48.429
It's time.

39:12.704 --> 39:14.664
Please, someone help!

39:14.706 --> 39:18.793
Chasseur, she's not breathing!
Someone help!

40:32.742 --> 40:35.119
It's better this way.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.121
For both of you.

40:37.162 --> 40:41.876
You were wise to kill it
before it fully transformed.

40:48.883 --> 40:53.096
Exemplary work, Dr. Chasseur.
The bishop will be pleased.

40:53.137 --> 40:56.264
Three fucking weeks
you left me in there with it,

40:56.307 --> 40:59.644
knowing she'd turn.

40:59.684 --> 41:02.521
You needed to smell it.

41:02.563 --> 41:06.191
She was pregnant.

41:06.233 --> 41:09.903
Welcome to the Order
of the Dragon, Dr. Chasseur.

41:15.827 --> 41:18.537
Geez, it stinks in here.

42:58.302 --> 43:00.514
Darlings.

43:00.556 --> 43:02.474
Oh, Letha.

43:06.604 --> 43:10.191
Such a beautiful boy.

43:19.324 --> 43:21.367
Look at that
cocky little prick.

43:21.410 --> 43:24.288
- Jesus, Dale, what now?
- I'm here and JR's not,

43:24.329 --> 43:26.749
leaving that freak
and his whore mother

43:26.791 --> 43:29.210
as the once and future king
of the Godfrey Institute.

43:29.251 --> 43:31.878
Lord help us all.

43:35.883 --> 43:38.844
- Two waters, please.
- Uh, one with peppermint, please.

43:38.885 --> 43:40.887
My stomach.

43:43.224 --> 43:45.184
Thanks.

43:45.226 --> 43:49.021
Are you all right?

43:52.733 --> 43:55.235
You always knew how
to find the right spot.

43:55.278 --> 43:58.072
I don't know if you've
given it any thought,

43:58.114 --> 44:01.492
but you should have your baby
here, at the institute.

44:01.532 --> 44:03.452
Cola product, please.

44:03.494 --> 44:05.496
I didn't think they handled
that sort of thing here.

44:05.537 --> 44:08.331
I hear they're opening
an obstetrics unit.

44:08.373 --> 44:11.043
They have the best doctors
in the world. Even better,

44:11.085 --> 44:14.463
you'd be close to home. Yeah?

44:14.505 --> 44:17.340
Whatever's best.

44:18.759 --> 44:20.719
Oh, God.

44:25.099 --> 44:27.184
Get your hands off her.
Are you OK?

44:27.226 --> 44:29.436
- What happened?
- Give me your jacket.

44:29.478 --> 44:32.356
What's wrong?

44:32.396 --> 44:34.983
Give me your jacket.
Come on. I'm taking you home.

44:35.026 --> 44:37.235
What about Roman?

44:39.238 --> 44:41.657
Listen to me, little girl.
If you want to have this baby,

44:41.699 --> 44:43.826
you need to start acting
like a pregnant woman,

44:43.867 --> 44:47.288
not some starry-eyed
party favor.

44:50.791 --> 44:52.751
Stay. I'll drive her.

44:52.793 --> 44:56.838
As soon as this fiasco's over,
then I'll be home.

45:11.729 --> 45:14.523
Bourbon, please, straight.

45:27.036 --> 45:29.204
Another one.

45:51.184 --> 45:53.686
Twelve goddamn years.

45:53.729 --> 45:55.689
What?

45:55.731 --> 45:58.817
Since that bitch
drove your brother to it.

45:58.858 --> 46:01.612
You're fucking drunk, Dale.

46:01.653 --> 46:04.697
At least the rug rat's
finally off the teat,

46:04.740 --> 46:06.825
though I doubt
he'd have the fortitude

46:06.867 --> 46:09.702
to pull his own pecker,
let alone run a business.

46:09.744 --> 46:13.081
Go home. Sleep it off.

46:15.084 --> 46:17.668
Thank you, sir.

46:17.711 --> 46:20.881
Well, piss on her!

46:20.923 --> 46:24.009
Piss on her,

46:24.050 --> 46:27.387
and piss on her useless brat!

46:27.430 --> 46:29.181
Hmph!

46:46.240 --> 46:49.160
What?

46:57.126 --> 46:59.295
Ladies and gentlemen.

47:01.297 --> 47:03.798
It's been 20 years
since last we gathered.

47:03.840 --> 47:07.677
Then, it was to celebrate the
inauguration of the Godfrey Institute,

47:07.719 --> 47:10.431
the long-held dream

47:10.472 --> 47:12.766
of my late husband,

47:12.807 --> 47:14.893
JR Godfrey.

47:27.197 --> 47:30.492
Now we're getting somewhere.

47:38.959 --> 47:42.296
Now all these years later, we gather
once more to celebrate this good man,

47:42.338 --> 47:45.132
JR,

47:45.173 --> 47:46.884
businessman,

47:46.925 --> 47:48.885
friend,

47:48.927 --> 47:52.431
husband and father.

47:52.472 --> 47:56.227
<i>JR's greatest passion</i>
<i>was his family.</i>

47:56.268 --> 47:58.936
<i>His death was a terrible tragedy</i>
<i>felt deeply</i>

47:58.979 --> 48:02.273
- <i>by all who knew him. </i>
- Oh, honey.

48:04.693 --> 48:08.989
<i>But none more</i>
<i>than our son, Roman.</i>

48:09.030 --> 48:13.117
- Right on fucking cue.
- Oh, for Christ's sakes.

48:13.160 --> 48:15.871
Come on, take a bow, Liv.
That's a hell of a performance.

48:15.913 --> 48:19.708
- That's enough.
- Open your eyes, Godfrey.

48:19.750 --> 48:22.001
If anyone killed
your brother, it was her.

48:27.840 --> 48:30.885
- I got this.
- Oh, get off of me.

48:30.927 --> 48:33.596
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving.
- Let's go.

48:33.637 --> 48:36.517
Where's my fucking wife?!

48:39.811 --> 48:42.481
My husband's death
affected us all

48:42.523 --> 48:45.401
in different ways.
After the shock passed,

48:45.443 --> 48:49.280
I chose to focus my attentions
on the institute,

48:49.320 --> 48:52.490
comforted knowing that
my husband's healing legacy

48:52.532 --> 48:54.659
would continue,

48:54.701 --> 48:57.913
first through me,

48:57.954 --> 49:01.750
and then our son.

49:49.465 --> 49:51.425
What is that?

49:51.467 --> 49:55.596
Oh, my god. Roman?

49:55.637 --> 49:58.932
Roman?

49:58.974 --> 50:00.675
Please tell Theo

50:00.795 --> 50:03.604
that the institute
will be in good hands.
