IT'S EIGHTY-FIVE
AND SUNNY TODAY IN PASADENA.

00:07.478 --> 00:10.141
THAT'S RIGHT,
IT'S CHRISTMAS TIME.

00:10.141 --> 00:12.143
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MY WHOLE LIFE,

00:12.143 --> 00:14.645
I GET TO SPEND CHRISTMAS
AS PART OF A FAMILY,

00:14.645 --> 00:17.618
AND I'M SO EXCITED THAT
I EVEN LET THEM DRESS ME UP.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.320
CHECK IT OUT.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.651
PRETTY COOL, HUH?

00:20.651 --> 00:24.024
HEY, I GOT THE RED NOSE
AND I CAN TALK.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.057
I WONDER IF I CAN FLY.

00:26.057 --> 00:27.228
AAH!

00:29.200 --> 00:31.702
NOPE.

00:31.702 --> 00:33.704
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:33.704 --> 00:36.707
I FINALLY GET TO DISCOVER
THE TRUE MEANING OF CHRISTMAS.

00:36.707 --> 00:41.072
HEY, I THINK IT MEANS
HAVING A PLACE TO PEE INDOORS.

00:41.072 --> 00:43.244
All: NO!

00:43.244 --> 00:46.447
SORRY. FIRST CHRISTMAS.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.578
DON'T FEEL BAD, STAN.

00:47.578 --> 00:50.581
LAST CHRISTMAS, I DRANK
A WHOLE CARTON OF EGG NOG

00:50.581 --> 00:52.583
AND THREW UP
ON SANTA'S COOKIE PLATE.

00:52.583 --> 00:57.358
THEY WERE GONE THE NEXT MORNING.
SANTA'S GROSS.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.831

THESE PINE NEEDLES OUTSIDE.

01:00.831 --> 01:02.193

01:02.193 --> 01:03.694
YOU KNOW HOW
IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD

01:03.694 --> 01:06.737
THERE'S ONE MEAN, SCARY GUY
THAT NOBODY LIKES?

01:06.737 --> 01:09.840
PHIL TRUMMER TRAINS THAT GUY.

01:09.840 --> 01:12.443
MR. TRUMMER, WE WERE
GONNA CLEAN THOSE UP.

01:12.443 --> 01:17.378
DADDY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID
TO LET THEM BLOW INTO
NASTY OLD MAN TRUMMER'S YARD?

01:17.378 --> 01:20.211
MY DAD CALLS EVERYONE
NASTY OLD MAN TRUMMER.

01:20.211 --> 01:23.254
HE CALLS MY MOM
NASTY OLD MAN TRUMMER.

01:23.254 --> 01:26.717
SO, MR. TRUMMER,
ANY SPECIAL PLANS
FOR THE HOLIDAYS?

01:26.717 --> 01:30.691
OH, THANKS FOR ASKING,
NASTY OLD MAN TRUMMER.

01:30.691 --> 01:36.227
JUST CALLING THE COPS IF YOU
LEAVE YOUR CHRISTMAS LIGHTS ON
AFTER 8:00.

01:36.227 --> 01:38.599
WOW, YOU CAN REALLY
TELL IT'S CHRISTMAS.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.673
HE WAS SO MUCH NICER THIS TIME.
HE DIDN'T CALL ME SALLY
OR TELL ME TO CUT MY HAIR.

01:42.673 --> 01:44.675

WORST GIFT GIVER.

GONNA GET THAT FOR YOU?

03:23.574 --> 03:25.476
RIGHT DOWN THE STREET

07:36.126 --> 07:38.959

07:38.959 --> 07:40.631
WHY WOULD SHE
GIVE THAT TO A KID?

07:40.631 --> 07:45.866
MAYBE FOR THE SAME REASON
SHE GAVE THESE TO A KID.

07:45.866 --> 07:48.539

07:48.539 --> 07:50.501
DOESN'T MOMMY LIKE YOU?

07:50.501 --> 07:53.173
THE QUESTION IS, DIDN'T GRANDMA
HAVE A TOOTHBRUSH?

07:53.173 --> 07:57.578
IF ANY OF MY PRESENTS
ARE THIS BAD, I'M GONNA FREAK.

07:57.578 --> 07:59.550

07:59.550 --> 08:04.555

HOW MUCH WE HATE THE GIFTS,

08:10.521 --> 08:12.623
SHE WILL HAVE
A VERY SAD CHRISTMAS.

08:12.623 --> 08:15.666
JUDGING BY THIS PICTURE,
YOUR MOM CAN'T HELP BUT SMILE.

08:15.666 --> 08:17.828

"NO, AMANDA, I'M NOT
COMING OVER TO YOUR HOUSE
BECAUSE YOUR SISTER'S A MODEL.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.640
I LIKE HEARING ABOUT
YOUR SKIN PROBLEMS."

08:30.911 --> 08:34.244

OUR REACTIONS. WATCH THIS.

08:34.244 --> 08:36.116
I UNWRAP THE BOX.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.287
WHAT COULD IT BE?

08:37.287 --> 08:38.949
SOMETHING I'VE ALWAYS WANTED!

08:38.949 --> 08:43.554
A LOOK OF SURPRISE, A TINY GASP,
A SQUEAL, A BUTT WIGGLE.

08:43.554 --> 08:45.556
WHO'S UP NEXT?

08:45.556 --> 08:47.698
OH, ME, ME, ME! I GOT THIS.

08:47.698 --> 08:50.030
"HEY, WOW, GREAT GIFT, ELLEN.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.103
I MEAN, YOU NAILED IT!
HOW DID YOU KNOW?!"

08:53.103 --> 08:55.135

08:55.135 --> 08:59.269

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE
WHO DOESN'T GET TO TALK.

08:59.269 --> 09:00.611

09:00.611 --> 09:04.615
IF I BUTT WIGGLE
WITHOUT TALKING,
I GET THE WORM MEDICINE.

09:04.615 --> 09:07.147
ALL RIGHT, CHLOE,
SHOW ME YOUR STUFF.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.549
CONVINCE ME YOU
REALLY LOVE YOUR PRESENT.

09:11.752 --> 09:12.783
WHAT'S THAT LOOK?

09:12.783 --> 09:14.284
I DRANK THREE JUICE BOXES.

09:14.284 --> 09:15.986
I HAVE TO GO!

09:19.229 --> 09:21.231

09:21.231 --> 09:23.594

09:23.594 --> 09:27.097
NO, YOUR THRILLED
PRESENT-OPENING FACE. GO!

09:27.097 --> 09:28.969

WITH THE SKIN PROBLEM.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.771
WELL, MOM DOESN'T HAVE
A SKIN PROBLEM.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.272
THEN WHY DOES SHE WEAR
ALL THAT WHITE STUFF ON--

09:32.272 --> 09:33.674
THAT'S NOT HER!

09:35.005 --> 09:36.847
HEY, I CAN FAKE IT
ALL YOU WANT,

09:36.847 --> 09:40.150
BUT WHAT IF THE GIFT IS EVEN
WORSE THAN I CAN IMAGINE?

09:40.150 --> 09:42.683
WELL, THEN THERE'S
ONLY ONE THING TO DO.

09:42.683 --> 09:46.316

SO WE WON'T BE HORRIFIED

OUT OF YOUR BODY,

BETTER LUCK WITH MINE.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.709

10:44.945 --> 10:46.646
JUST TASTE ONE OF MY COOKIES.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.118
NO, JUST TASTE ONE OF MINE.
MINE ARE BETTER.

10:48.118 --> 10:49.349
NO, JUST TASTE MINE.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.921
NO, MINE'S
AN OLD FAMILY RECIPE.

10:50.921 --> 10:52.683
YOUR FAMILY MADE SHOES.

10:52.683 --> 10:55.686
( muffled arguing )

10:55.686 --> 10:59.159
Both: ( muffled )
OH, HELLO, CHLOE.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.694
UM, ARE YOU
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING?

11:03.694 --> 11:06.436
YES, SOMETHING HORRIBLE
I HAVE TO PRETEND TO LIKE.

11:06.436 --> 11:09.139
ELLEN, GIVE CHLOE
ONE OF YOUR COOKIES.

11:12.773 --> 11:13.944
( doorbell rings )

11:13.944 --> 11:15.445
WHO IS IT?

11:15.445 --> 11:17.778
NASTY OLD MAN TRUMMER.

11:17.778 --> 11:23.253
I'M SUPPOSED TO PRETEND
WE'RE NOT HOME. BUT HI.

11:23.253 --> 11:25.315
HEY, BERNADETTE PETERS.

11:25.315 --> 11:27.788
I DON'T GET THAT.

11:27.788 --> 11:31.121
I FOUND YOUR DOG OUTSIDE
TRYING TO ESCAPE.

11:31.121 --> 11:32.963
TELL YOUR PARENTS
TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.

11:32.963 --> 11:38.268
YOU DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO HIM,
NOT THAT I CARE.

11:38.268 --> 11:40.801
I WASN'T ESCAPING.
WE WERE LOOKING FOR PRESENTS.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.303
THEN I HAD TO GO OUTSIDE
AND LEAVE A PRESENT.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.835
( squishes )

11:44.835 --> 11:46.737
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.711
ANY LUCK IN THE KITCHEN, CHLOE?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.243
NO PRESENTS IN THE KITCHEN.

11:53.243 --> 11:55.185
WELL, THEN THERE'S ONLY
ONE PLACE LEFT TO LOOK.

11:55.185 --> 11:56.186
COME ON.

11:57.848 --> 11:59.319
ARE YOU SURE
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS?

11:59.319 --> 12:00.891
I KNOW WE'RE DOING
THE WRONG THING,

12:00.891 --> 12:02.222
BUT WE'RE DOING IT
FOR THE RIGHT REASONS.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.754
STORY OF MY LIFE.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.898
GUYS, I THINK WE HIT PAY DIRT!

12:07.898 --> 12:10.801
SHE'S GIVING US DIRT?

12:10.801 --> 12:12.102
NO, IT'S AN EXPRESSION.

12:12.102 --> 12:14.935
ALTHOUGH IN THIS CASE,
YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.

12:14.935 --> 12:16.907
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S LOOK AT OUR PRESENTS

12:16.907 --> 12:19.109
AND GET ALL OF THE HORROR
OUT OF OUR SYSTEMS.

12:19.109 --> 12:21.942
REMEMBER, IT'S ALL FOR MOM.

12:24.514 --> 12:27.147
COOL! AN X-KUBE!

12:27.147 --> 12:28.748
WHAT?

12:28.748 --> 12:30.320
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!

12:30.320 --> 12:32.252
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.926
A DOLL! I LOVE HER!

12:35.926 --> 12:37.788
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

12:37.788 --> 12:40.490
WHY? I'M A LITTLE GIRL,
I LOVE DOLLS.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.864
MOM BOUGHT GOOD GIFTS?

12:43.864 --> 12:46.967
MAYBE BEING IN THIS NEW FAMILY
HAS CHANGED HER.

12:46.967 --> 12:50.470
WOW, I WON'T HAVE TO PRETEND
ON CHRISTMAS MORNING.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.803
I CAN ACTUALLY BE THRILLED!

12:56.206 --> 12:58.408
A CHRISTMAS PONCHO?

12:58.408 --> 13:00.881
NO!

13:00.881 --> 13:02.512
AND BUTT WIGGLE.

13:02.512 --> 13:04.284
Stan: HEY, LOOK WHAT I GOT!

13:04.284 --> 13:06.786
IT LOOKS LIKE A BONE,
BUT IT'S MADE OUT OF RUBBER.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.358
IF THIS THING SQUEAKS, I'M--

13:08.358 --> 13:10.420
( squeaks )

13:10.420 --> 13:13.563
JUMPING JACK RUSSELL!
SHE TOTALLY GETS ME!

13:13.563 --> 13:17.898
YEAH, SHE GETS YOU GUYS.

13:17.898 --> 13:21.001
ALL OF MY LIFE,
I'VE BEEN PRETENDING
TO LIKE HER HORRIBLE GIFTS.

13:21.001 --> 13:27.337
I THOUGHT SHE WAS
A TERRIBLE GIFT GIVER,
BUT IT'S JUST WITH ME.

13:27.337 --> 13:29.339
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

13:29.339 --> 13:31.081
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK HER?

13:31.081 --> 13:32.812
HOW CAN I EVEN FACE HER?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.915
TURN AROUND.

13:41.892 --> 13:46.556
UM, PROBABLY UNCOOL
TO SQUEAK MY AWESOME GIFT
IN FRONT OF YOU RIGHT NOW.

13:46.556 --> 13:49.829
SO I'M JUST GONNA TAKE IT
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

13:49.829 --> 13:54.834
( squeaks )

14:02.542 --> 14:04.244
HEY, HON.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.176
I'M SO DEPRESSED.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.848
WELL, I WAS A LITTLE HARD
ON YOU EARLIER,

14:08.848 --> 14:11.481
BUT BAKING
IS NOT FOR EVERYONE.

14:11.481 --> 14:16.186
NOT THAT. DO YOU THINK
AVERY AND I RELATE WELL?

14:16.186 --> 14:18.488
AND I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY
OF YOUR THERAPY GOBBLEDY-GOOK.

14:18.488 --> 14:21.261
CAN I USE
THE LANGUAGE OF DANCE?

14:21.261 --> 14:23.463
PLEASE DON'T.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.595
MOM, I THINK WE NEED TO TALK.

14:25.595 --> 14:29.039
HAVE YOU REALLY HATED
ALL THE GIFTS I'VE GIVEN YOU?

14:29.039 --> 14:31.871
I'M REALLY SORRY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.544
I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT
YOU WERE A BAD GIFT GIVER.

14:34.544 --> 14:38.548
BUT YOU GOT SUCH GOOD GIFTS
FOR EVERYONE ELSE THIS YEAR.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.310
DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

14:40.310 --> 14:43.984
OH, SWEETHEART, I LOVE YOU.
YOU'RE MY GIRL.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.885
I THOUGHT YOU LOVED MY GIFTS.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.657
WHY WOULD I LOVE
GRANDMA'S TEETH?

14:47.657 --> 14:49.489
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL,

14:49.489 --> 14:52.662
YOU USED TO TAKE THEM OUT
OF THE GLASS BY HER BED
AND PLAY WITH THEM.

14:52.662 --> 14:55.665
I WAS THREE. AND EVEN THEN,
YOU MIGHT HAVE DISCOURAGED THAT.

14:55.665 --> 14:59.899
WHY? WE USED
TO LAUGH AND LAUGH.
IT WAS OUR THING.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.072
YOU GAVE HER TEETH?

15:02.072 --> 15:05.976
NOW, WHEN YOU SAY
SHE HAS YOUR MOTHER'S EYES,
YOU DON'T MEAN SHE...

15:08.338 --> 15:12.612
I GIVE YOU THINGS THAT
ARE SPECIAL TO BOTH OF US,
LIKE THE CLOWN PICTURE.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.286
I HAD IT IN MY ROOM
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
AND NOW IT'S IN YOUR ROOM.

15:16.286 --> 15:18.088
I HATE THE CLOWN PICTURE.

15:18.088 --> 15:20.920
NEXT YOU'LL BE TELLING ME YOU
HATE PINEAPPLE, AND BADMINTON,

15:20.920 --> 15:23.593
AND WRITING WORDS
ON GRAINS OF RICE.

15:23.593 --> 15:24.924
I DO.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
WHICH ONE?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.128
ALL OF THEM.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.930
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.263
WELL, ONCE I DID WRITE IT
ON A GRAIN OF RICE.

15:33.263 --> 15:36.706
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT
YOUR FEELINGS, SO I COOKED IT.

15:36.706 --> 15:40.570
I THOUGHT WE WERE SO SIMILAR.

15:40.570 --> 15:45.075
YOU KNOW, IT'S EVERY
MOTHER'S DREAM THAT HER
DAUGHTER BE JUST LIKE HER.

15:45.075 --> 15:49.249
BUT LOOK AT YOU,
YOU'RE YOUR OWN PERSON NOW.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.021
IT'S HORRIBLE.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.523
I HAVE AN HOUR ON MONDAY
FROM 4:00 TO 5:00

15:53.523 --> 15:55.155
IF YOU WANNA COME IN.

15:59.189 --> 16:01.731
I'M SORRY YOU HATED
ALL THE GIFTS I'VE GIVEN YOU.

16:01.731 --> 16:04.694
DON'T SAY THAT.
I LOVED SOME OF THE GIFTS.

16:04.694 --> 16:07.137
( crying ) NO, YOU DIDN'T.

16:07.137 --> 16:10.300
( crying )
IT'S TRUE, I DIDN'T.

16:10.300 --> 16:14.104
( crying )
YOU WERE MY LITTLE GIRL.

16:14.104 --> 16:17.447
( crying ) MOM, STOP CRYING.
YOU'RE MAKING ME CRY.

16:17.447 --> 16:19.749
( crying )
YOU'RE MAKING ME CRY.

16:19.749 --> 16:22.582
( crying )
YOU'RE BOTH MAKING ME CRY!

16:22.582 --> 16:24.254
( crying )
DON'T YOU GO DOWN, BIG GUY.

16:24.254 --> 16:27.757
YOU WERE THE ONLY THING
KEEPING ME STRONG!

16:27.757 --> 16:30.620
( crying ) WHY WOULD YOU
GET ME A CHRISTMAS PONCHO?

16:30.620 --> 16:36.666
( crying ) I GOT ONE TOO.
WE WERE GONNA BE TWINS.

16:36.666 --> 16:39.599
( crying )
I DON'T THINK THAT'S HEALTHY.

16:39.599 --> 16:42.572
( crying ) SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

16:42.572 --> 16:46.576
OKAY. THIS YEAR'S
GONNA BE DIFFERENT.

16:46.576 --> 16:50.140
I'M GONNA GET PRESENTS
FOR YOU, NOT FOR ME.

16:50.140 --> 16:52.142
THANK YOU, MOM.

16:52.142 --> 16:54.184
I'M GONNA GO SHOPPING
RIGHT NOW.

16:54.184 --> 16:55.445
I'LL GET MY LIST.

16:55.445 --> 16:56.616
NO, NO. NO LISTS.

16:56.616 --> 17:00.620
I'M GONNA PROVE
THAT I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.453
SHE HAS NO IDEA WHO I AM!

17:03.453 --> 17:04.694
( crying )

17:04.694 --> 17:07.557
NOBODY LIKES
"ALL THAT JAZZ-MAS"!

17:07.557 --> 17:09.299
( crying )

17:09.299 --> 17:11.561
I JUST SAT ON MY TAIL!

17:11.561 --> 17:15.465
( all crying )

17:16.766 --> 17:18.638
Bennett:
OUR FIRST CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

17:18.638 --> 17:21.141
BLENDING OUR LOVE
AND OUR TRADITIONS.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.713
AND WE DID A GREAT JOB
COMPROMISING ON
ANOTHER TRADITION:

17:23.713 --> 17:24.714
HOW TO DO THE TREE.

17:24.714 --> 17:26.376
AH, THAT WAS A TOUGH ONE.

17:26.376 --> 17:29.819
BUT IT'S A BIG STATEMENT
ON HOW WE MAKE THIS FAMILY WORK.

17:31.781 --> 17:32.682
MWAH.

17:32.682 --> 17:35.385
HEY, KIDS,
TIME TO OPEN PRESENTS.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.387
I AM SO NERVOUS
ABOUT WHAT I GOT AVERY.

17:37.387 --> 17:38.758
CAN'T WE JUST DO THIS LATER?

17:38.758 --> 17:40.460
I UNDERSTAND THE NERVES,

17:40.460 --> 17:42.792
BECAUSE AFTER ALL
THE WEIGHT YOU AND AVERY
HAVE PUT ON THIS,

17:42.792 --> 17:47.137
I'D SAY THE FUTURE
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

17:47.137 --> 17:49.669
THANKS. I FEEL MUCH BETTER NOW.

17:51.501 --> 17:54.404
AVERY,
HERE'S YOUR GIFT FROM MOM.

17:54.404 --> 17:57.247
UM, ACTUALLY, I'M THINKING
OF RUNNING AWAY TO MEXICO.

17:57.247 --> 18:01.581
WELL, AT LEAST
YOU GOT THE PONCHO.

18:01.581 --> 18:05.655
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
LET'S OPEN SOME PRESENTS.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.657
UM, SHOULDN'T WE HAVE
SOME BREAKFAST FIRST?

18:07.657 --> 18:09.659
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE
SOME SCONES FROM SCRATCH,

18:09.659 --> 18:14.294
OR BREAD IN AN ADOBE OVEN
WE BUILD OURSELVES
FROM MUD AND STRAW.

18:14.294 --> 18:18.228
YES, LET'S GO TO A FIELD
AND PICK THE STRAW
AND GATHER THE MUD. COME ON!

18:18.228 --> 18:21.571
UH-UH-UH. GIRLS, GIRLS.

18:21.571 --> 18:25.575
IF WHATEVER IS IN THAT BOX
DESTROYS YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

18:25.575 --> 18:27.407
IT WASN'T MEANT TO BE.

18:41.691 --> 18:43.693
( knuckles crack )

18:48.428 --> 18:51.561
( chuckles nervously )

19:03.743 --> 19:05.515
SURPRISE!

19:23.633 --> 19:25.395
( gasps )

19:25.395 --> 19:29.399
A GIFT CARD! I LOVE IT!

19:29.399 --> 19:31.641
REALLY?!

19:31.641 --> 19:36.476
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED!
TOTAL CONTROL OVER MY GIFT!

19:36.476 --> 19:38.808
YOU KNOW ME!
YOU KNOW ME SO WELL!

19:38.808 --> 19:42.282
I DO! I REALLY DO!

19:42.282 --> 19:43.913
OH!

19:43.913 --> 19:45.655
HERE, OPEN MY GIFT.
OKAY.

19:51.361 --> 19:52.822
( gasps )

19:52.822 --> 19:56.195
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!

19:58.428 --> 19:59.929
WE'RE TWINS!

20:00.930 --> 20:03.303
I KNOW! TWINS FOREVER!

20:03.303 --> 20:06.376
YEAH, STILL NOT HEALTHY.

20:06.376 --> 20:07.837
HERE, LOOK. THERE'S A CARD.

20:07.837 --> 20:10.940
OH! OH!

20:10.940 --> 20:13.743
( gasps )
OH! A GRAIN OF RICE!

20:13.743 --> 20:14.744
YEAH!

20:14.744 --> 20:16.816
OH, THANKS.

20:18.948 --> 20:20.820
OH, SWEETHEART,
THAT'S LOVELY.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.991
OH...

20:21.991 --> 20:23.993
OH, LOOK, THERE'S MORE.

20:27.797 --> 20:31.331
ARE WE THE ONLY TWO NORMAL ONES
IN THIS FAMILY?

20:31.331 --> 20:35.004
YES. YES, WE ARE.

20:37.006 --> 20:38.938
OH...

20:38.938 --> 20:41.741
HEY, STAN, LOOK.
WE GOT YOU A PRESENT.

20:44.013 --> 20:46.015
IT'S A CHRISTMAS SWEATER!

20:47.677 --> 20:50.950
IT'S THE UGLIEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.353
BUT I KEPT IT ANYWAY.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.525
'CAUSE IT'LL ALWAYS REMIND ME

20:55.525 --> 20:58.358
OF MY FIRST CHRISTMAS
WITH MY NEW FAMILY.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.690
AND WE STARTED
A NEW FAMILY TRADITION.

21:00.690 --> 21:02.992
I GUESS
THE REAL MEANING OF CHRISTMAS

21:02.992 --> 21:05.395
IS THAT IT'S NOT
THE GIFTS THAT MATTER.

21:05.395 --> 21:07.397
IT'S THE LOVE THEY REPRESENT.

21:07.397 --> 21:09.399
AND IF YOU REALLY LOVE ME,

21:09.399 --> 21:12.572
NEXT YEAR YOU'LL GET ME
THAT T-REX BONE.

21:12.572 --> 21:16.446
HERE'S A PICTURE OF WHEN
I SAW IT AT THE BONE STORE.

21:16.446 --> 21:20.279
MERRY CHRISTMAS, EVERYONE.

21:25.014 --> 21:28.318
I GOT YOUR NOTE
ASKING ME TO COME OVER.

21:28.318 --> 21:29.989
WHAT NOTE?

21:29.989 --> 21:32.322
BENNETT DIDN'T WRITE
THAT NOTE, I DID.

21:32.322 --> 21:34.664
I DID A LITTLE RESEARCH
ON TRUMMER AND IT TURNS OUT

21:34.664 --> 21:37.597
HE WAS QUITE THE SONG
AND DANCE MAN IN HIS DAY.

21:37.597 --> 21:42.472
AND FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT!

21:42.472 --> 21:44.804
I JUST THOUGHT I'D DO
A LITTLE CHRISTMAS GOOD DEED

21:44.804 --> 21:48.978
AND INVITE TRUMMER
TO GIVE US A LESSON.

21:48.978 --> 21:51.781
I REALIZED HE WAS JUST
A LONELY GUY ON CHRISTMAS,

21:51.781 --> 21:53.783
LOOKING FOR
A LITTLE HUMAN CONTACT.

21:53.783 --> 21:55.785
FOSSE!

21:55.785 --> 21:58.448
WHAT A BUNCH OF LOSERS.

21:58.448 --> 22:01.320
THE HEART THEY YANKED OUT OF ME
HAD MORE RHYTHM THAN YOU!

22:01.320 --> 22:05.955
STILL NOT A NICE GUY,
BUT A LITTLE LESS LONELY.

22:05.955 --> 22:08.958
AND...
