[Brian] Previously on
What About Brian:

00:01.875 --> 00:04.667
He's supposed to be the dad,
not date the girl I date.

00:04.667 --> 00:08.250
- I think you're
great... and smart.
- But we're friends, right?

00:08.250 --> 00:11.166
This is Heather Hillman.
We just got married!

00:11.166 --> 00:13.208
- Isn't that the, uh...
- Stripper?

00:13.208 --> 00:14.792
- Yeah, that'd be her.
- Sweet.

00:14.792 --> 00:17.834
- What was he doing in Naples?
- It's nonsense. So let it go.

00:17.834 --> 00:20.000
What if there is something?
Some secret?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.208
- How did your date go?
- Fine. Yours?

00:22.208 --> 00:23.917
Awesome.

00:29.500 --> 00:31.625
[Dave] All right, everybody.

00:31.625 --> 00:34.667
Got some fresh homemade chicken
straight out of the bucket.

00:34.667 --> 00:35.917
Come and get it!

00:37.667 --> 00:40.000
Oh, you're hilarious.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.834
You got any mac and cheese?
I'm craving it big time.

00:42.834 --> 00:45.542
Here you go, Mommy.
Mac and cheese. Enjoy.

00:45.542 --> 00:47.375
Hey, think I'll pass.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.375
Oh, I hear some monkeys.
Come on, let's get some dinner.

00:50.375 --> 00:52.875
- Can I have
some chicken, please?
- Of course.

00:52.875 --> 00:56.041
No baked beans, OK?
Wanna know why?

00:56.041 --> 00:58.041
- No one wants
to know why, honey.
- Why?

00:58.041 --> 00:59.667
'Cause...

00:59.667 --> 01:01.834
♪ Beans, beans
They're good for your heart ♪

01:01.834 --> 01:04.583
- ♪ The more you eat,
the more... ♪
- You eat more chicken.

01:04.583 --> 01:08.417
- There you go.
- All right, girls.
Let's hit it.

01:08.417 --> 01:11.709
- Come on, guys.
Come on. Get going.
- When is Mommy coming home?

01:11.709 --> 01:15.208
I told you, honey,
that she's gonna be home soon.

01:15.208 --> 01:16.792
OK?

01:20.750 --> 01:22.375
[Heather] Where is Deena?

01:22.375 --> 01:26.583
Well, they've decided not
to do the group functions
together anymore.

01:26.583 --> 01:29.750
- Why not?
- Well, it's...

01:29.750 --> 01:31.250
Because we decided...

01:31.250 --> 01:34.333
We decided that we should
switch off on these events.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.417
You know, to make it
easier on you guys.

01:37.417 --> 01:41.583
So while I'm here with you,
Deena's out on a date with
a rich guy.

01:41.583 --> 01:44.959
To avoid awkward moments.
Sort of just like this one.

01:44.959 --> 01:48.083
Well, I would like to make
a toast and also change
the subject.

01:48.083 --> 01:49.583
- Yes, please!
- Hear, hear.

01:49.583 --> 01:51.375
To the last time you will see me

01:51.375 --> 01:54.083
at one of these weekly dinners
without a baby.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.750
- May God help us all.
- May God help us all.

02:00.709 --> 02:02.875
A game you don't even
believe in, you know?

02:02.875 --> 02:05.959
I mean, what do you got?
Cotton candy mountains

02:05.959 --> 02:09.125
and peppermint stick ladders.
Who cares? Just kill me.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.250
It's hard selling something
when you don't really
believe it.

02:12.250 --> 02:14.291
Trust me, I know.

02:14.291 --> 02:18.625
What? You try doing your job
in a G-string, and you'll see
what I mean.

02:18.625 --> 02:22.125
Some nights I go out there
and I just feel like
I'm phoning it in.

02:22.125 --> 02:25.500
- Why don't we go to the living
room... - Perfect example, all
right?

02:25.500 --> 02:27.792
I was supposed to do
a number with Anastasia.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.625
She's supposed to grab the pole,
then I do this thing...

02:30.625 --> 02:32.709
No, no, baby.
No one wants to hear it.

02:32.709 --> 02:35.041
- Oh, yes, we do.
- Oh, yeah. Are you kidding me?

02:39.041 --> 02:42.583
Why don't you go ask Nicole,
see if she needs any help.

02:42.583 --> 02:43.959
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.166
What is the matter with you?

02:48.166 --> 02:52.000
It's the first rule of life.
You never interrupt a
girl-on-girl story.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.667
That girl happens to be my wife!

02:54.667 --> 02:56.291
Yeah, OK. I'm sorry
about that.

02:56.291 --> 02:58.333
Yeah. That's
uncomfortable, I guess.

02:58.333 --> 03:01.667
I mean, on the way over here,
a bunch of frat guys recognized
her.

03:01.667 --> 03:05.333
Yeah, it's like being
married to a movie star.

03:05.333 --> 03:08.834
You know, I mean,
one who's not in movies

03:08.834 --> 03:12.500
and one who takes her clothes
off for money. You know what
I'm saying?

03:12.500 --> 03:15.625
Why don't you just tell her to
stop? Obviously, it bothers you.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.792
What am I gonna tell her?
She makes good money,
pays for school.

03:18.792 --> 03:20.166
Who am I to tell her to stop?

03:20.166 --> 03:23.166
Who are you to say it?
You're her husband.

03:23.166 --> 03:27.834
You say, "Honey, I'm your
husband and I do not want
you dancing naked."

03:29.375 --> 03:31.375
You don't hear that
very often, do you?

03:36.041 --> 03:38.542
[Dave] Well, let's
scrub some dishes.

03:38.542 --> 03:41.875
So... what did you think?

03:41.875 --> 03:44.208
Why were they all
running around like that?

03:44.208 --> 03:47.875
- They were trying
to catch the bad guy.
- There was a bad guy?

03:47.875 --> 03:50.041
Did you not read
the title cards?

03:50.041 --> 03:52.041
I kinda forgot my glasses.

03:52.041 --> 03:56.709
I just didn't wanna tell you
'cause I didn't want to ruin it
for you.

03:56.709 --> 03:59.458
Oh, I guess it's two for two
in the bad date department?

03:59.458 --> 04:02.208
No, no, no! This was fun.
And the first one wasn't bad.

04:02.208 --> 04:05.375
It was just too much. You know,
it was just kinda way too much.

04:06.542 --> 04:10.125
- Oh, wow.
- It's a baby book!

04:10.125 --> 04:12.125
We made it ourselves.

04:12.125 --> 04:14.291
Oh, I love it.

04:14.291 --> 04:18.500
- [Larissa] Don't cry.
- Oh, I can't help it.
It's just...

04:18.500 --> 04:21.375
This is so beautiful. I can't
believe you made this for me.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.375
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

04:25.166 --> 04:27.583
These are coupons for
baby-sitting.

04:27.583 --> 04:28.917
I'm available.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.583
- You're too young to baby-sit.
- Nuh-uh.

04:33.583 --> 04:36.750
- Yuh-huh.
- OK, OK. All right, all right.

04:36.750 --> 04:38.917
No one's old enough to baby-sit.

04:38.917 --> 04:40.667
That'll last for a half hour.

04:41.917 --> 04:44.083
I must have done
something right, huh?

04:44.083 --> 04:46.917
- They're amazing.
- Yeah, not bad.

04:48.166 --> 04:50.166
How are you feeling?

04:50.166 --> 04:52.959
I'm... a little nervous.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.000
Gonna be great.
And it's not so bad.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.959
[scoffs] How do you know?

04:57.959 --> 05:01.625
Deena would squeeze my arm so
hard I felt every contraction,
believe me.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.250
Did I ever show you this,
right there, that scar?

05:04.250 --> 05:07.291
That's Carrie's delivery.

05:07.291 --> 05:10.250
That's 'cause I told Deena
to keep up the good work.

05:10.250 --> 05:14.792
Well, I won't have
Angelo there to squeeze.

05:14.792 --> 05:17.792
First, I'd like to punch him out
but then when he came to,

05:17.792 --> 05:19.750
at least I'd have him
there to squeeze.

05:19.750 --> 05:21.792
I'm sorry, honey.

05:21.792 --> 05:24.750
I know this isn't working out
the way you wanted it to.

05:24.750 --> 05:28.458
[sighs] I'm just still so
angry at him, you know?

05:28.458 --> 05:32.458
I don't... I don't wanna
carry that anger into the...

05:33.625 --> 05:35.125
To the delivery room.

05:35.125 --> 05:37.625
Well, then don't, babe.
Let it go.

05:37.625 --> 05:41.542
I can't. I don't
wanna do this alone.

05:41.542 --> 05:44.417
I'm scared, and he should
be there with me,

05:44.417 --> 05:46.417
even though he was a cheater.

05:47.834 --> 05:48.959
I can go with you.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.709
I'll take you. I took you
to the movie premiere.

05:52.709 --> 05:54.667
That turned out... OK, sort of.

05:54.667 --> 05:56.959
- That was a little different.
- Yeah, Nic.

05:56.959 --> 05:59.625
I can do this. I'm a pro.
OK, I've done it three times.

05:59.625 --> 06:01.542
I know everything
there is to know.

06:01.542 --> 06:03.917
I know where to park,
what to bring, how to push.

06:03.917 --> 06:06.500
If I were in labor,
I'd definitely want me with me.

06:06.500 --> 06:10.000
Well, there's a lot of exposure
going on, you know?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.667
Yeah. Well, I can totally stay
north of the equator, you know?

06:13.667 --> 06:16.959
I'll just be an arm to squeeze.
Someone to scar.

06:19.375 --> 06:20.834
You'd really do this for me?

06:20.834 --> 06:23.208
You kidding? I'd do
anything for you.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.917
And Angelo too.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.667
'Cause if I weren't around,
and Deena was alone,

06:27.667 --> 06:30.000
he would totally
stand in for me.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.375
Yeah. What do you think?

06:33.375 --> 06:35.709
I like it.

06:35.709 --> 06:39.417
- [water running]
- [door opens]

06:41.875 --> 06:43.875
[water shuts off]

06:49.750 --> 06:51.417
What are you looking at?

06:52.542 --> 06:53.959
You.

06:53.959 --> 06:56.750
Well, stop. I look terrible.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.750
You wanna watch
some TV before bed?

07:01.750 --> 07:05.375
I don't want you to do it
anymore. You can quit.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.875
I can take care of you.
I want to take care of you.

07:08.875 --> 07:13.542
[sighs] And I want to take
care of myself. That's just
the way I am.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.792
You know, you don't have to be
so independent all the time.

07:16.792 --> 07:18.750
It's just a job, Adam.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.875
I'm just a performer
wearing a costume, that's all.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.583
Well, you deserve a better job.

07:23.583 --> 07:26.250
I make my own hours,
enough money to pay for school.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.583
It just works for me.

07:28.583 --> 07:30.917
- Heather, I...
- Adam.

07:30.917 --> 07:35.250
You've seen the place.
They serve lunch, for God sakes.

07:37.709 --> 07:40.166
[exhales sharply]

07:41.625 --> 07:44.458
Just try and be
supportive, OK?

07:44.458 --> 07:45.792
That's all I'm asking.

07:57.083 --> 08:00.250
I know what's going on.
You said a lot of things
to me at the church

08:00.250 --> 08:02.583
and made yourself vulnerable,
you're embarrassed.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.291
There is nothing
to be ashamed of.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.041
- This isn't about that.
- It isn't?

08:06.041 --> 08:08.208
I practiced that whole
speech for nothing?

08:08.208 --> 08:09.959
- No, it was nice.
- Thanks.

08:09.959 --> 08:12.834
Look, I like you. Obviously
I find you very attractive.

08:12.834 --> 08:16.291
- In a perfect world,
we'd be together.
- So, what's your problem?

08:16.291 --> 08:19.583
- You had an affair
with my father.
- Stop being such a moron.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.542
Exactly. Treat me like that,
like I disgust you.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.125
If that's what you want.

08:24.125 --> 08:27.000
I just think it's best if
we stay away from each other
for now.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.625
- OK?
- OK.

08:28.625 --> 08:32.500
So I decided, what better
way for all of us to get
to know one another

08:32.500 --> 08:34.208
than a company retreat?

08:34.208 --> 08:37.458
We're off to Ojai.
All of us, the whole company.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.083
Overnight in a hotel.
A little bonding.

08:40.083 --> 08:42.000
A lot of group activity.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.750
And attendance is mandatory.

You don't bring pit stains
to a company retreat. You know?

09:34.333 --> 09:36.458
- Looks like you don't care.
- I don't.

09:36.458 --> 09:39.041
You gonna spend the night
with Bridget at a hotel?

09:39.041 --> 09:41.709
You're not planning

- No. No way.
- Good. Good for you.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.709
Rule number two in life.
Never go after your dad's
sloppy seconds.

09:47.709 --> 09:51.625
'Cause it's just... just wrong.
On so many levels.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.750
Where are you getting
these rules from?

09:53.750 --> 09:54.875
Right here, buddy.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.917
This from a guy
who's spent the last hour

09:56.917 --> 09:59.667
- Googling some guy named T.K.
- I didn't name the guy,

09:59.667 --> 10:02.583
- I just don't like him.
- What kind of name
is T.K., anyway?

10:02.583 --> 10:05.750
Thaddius Korn.
A multi-millionaire
software designer.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.750
Pharmaceutical stuff.
That's fun.

10:07.750 --> 10:10.250
I thought you were going out
with Sandwich Girl.

10:10.250 --> 10:13.583
Naw, she's a baby.
She's barely older than Geneva.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.250
She lives with her parents.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.875
I can't date anybody who
doesn't have their own place.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.542
- You don't have your own place.
- I did.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.083
I mean, I do. Sometimes I do.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.959
I'm not gonna get involved
with somebody I work with.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.125
Remember last time?
Complete disaster.

10:28.125 --> 10:31.583
She delivers sandwiches to you.
You don't exactly work together.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.041
Wow, cubicle. That's low.

10:35.291 --> 10:37.625
- What's this now?
- What?

10:37.625 --> 10:39.458
Let me see the bag.

10:39.458 --> 10:41.125
You got cologne in here?

10:41.125 --> 10:44.792
I don't need you smelling
all manly when you're trying
to avoid Bridget.

10:44.792 --> 10:48.250
I told her we need to keep
our distance no matter how
attractive she is.

10:48.250 --> 10:50.291
You said you thought
she was attractive?

10:50.291 --> 10:53.625
What the hell are you thinking?
Are you thinking clear right
now?

10:53.625 --> 10:55.792
I don't think so.
That's rule number three.

10:55.792 --> 10:58.375
- No more rules, Dave.
- Fine, you don't need rules.

10:58.375 --> 11:02.041
You're stuck in her little web
and she's gonna spin you around
and eat you.

11:02.041 --> 11:05.125
I'm tired of being in the wrong
relationships. I'll be strong.

11:05.125 --> 11:08.125
Fine. I'm gonna help, OK?

11:08.125 --> 11:11.250
You need to keep your phone
on you at all times and call
me often.

11:11.250 --> 11:14.625
If you feel a little tingle
down below, think about your
buddy Dave.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.959
- Don't I always?
- Yeah.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.000
So you are one
centimeter dilated.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.792
One centimeter dilated, OK.
So what does that mean?

11:25.250 --> 11:27.000
It means that your cervix...

11:27.000 --> 11:30.500
- I know what it means,
but what does it mean?
- That's hard to say.

11:30.500 --> 11:34.333
Some people walk around for
weeks like this and others
progress quickly.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.792
I'll be right back. I need
to draw blood so we can check
your levels.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.291
Great.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.417
Oh, it'll be worth it soon.

11:42.417 --> 11:45.208
When you hold your little
baby girl in your arms

11:45.208 --> 11:48.333
for the first time,
you'll see. I promise.

11:48.333 --> 11:52.709
- Your girls were
so cute last night.
- Yeah? Tell me everything.

11:52.709 --> 11:57.291
They were bursting at the
seams to give me that beautiful
baby book.

11:57.291 --> 12:01.875
- Dave let them
give you the book?
- Why? Was he not supposed to?

12:01.875 --> 12:06.542
Well, the girls and I have been
working on that book for months.

12:06.542 --> 12:10.083
It wasn't Dave's fault.
The girls were just so
excited to give it to me.

12:10.083 --> 12:12.250
He wasn't trying
to steal your thunder.

12:12.250 --> 12:14.542
Whatever. It's just...
it's typical.

12:14.542 --> 12:17.291
Dave doesn't think about
those things, you know?

12:17.291 --> 12:19.041
Dave doesn't think, period.

12:20.291 --> 12:23.208
Look, Dave's been so great
to me since Angelo died.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.417
He really has been
there for me, you know?

12:25.417 --> 12:29.500
Really, I mean, even when
I told him how scared I was
about the delivery,

12:29.500 --> 12:31.709
he offered to be there
in the room with me...

12:31.709 --> 12:34.583
- You didn't say yes, did you?
- Should I have said no?

12:34.583 --> 12:37.625
Well, I... Nicole,
I just assumed.

12:37.625 --> 12:40.709
I mean, I am the one
standing here right now

12:40.709 --> 12:42.917
with your dilated
cervix, you know?

12:42.917 --> 12:46.583
And I bought you that, you know,
doughnut-hole pillow

12:46.583 --> 12:48.583
to sit on when you
get hemorrhoids.

12:48.583 --> 12:51.333
Not to mention that I am the
one who birthed three babies

12:51.333 --> 12:54.542
and not just stood there like
a deer caught in the headlights.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.458
You're right.
You're totally right.

12:56.458 --> 12:59.417
I just got caught up in
the moment, OK? I am sorry.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.375
- I will take care of it.
- OK.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.625
- I'll go tell him, OK?
- All right.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.959
OK. I promise.

13:08.417 --> 13:10.041
"Life sucks"?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.125
Is that really what you think?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.333
Hey.

13:14.333 --> 13:18.917
No, this is...
It's a game I'm working on.

13:18.917 --> 13:22.041
So just because I told you
I was 20 years old,
now life sucks?

13:22.041 --> 13:24.166
- Is that it?
- No, that's not it.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.834
Life sucked way before that.

13:26.834 --> 13:29.458
Then life got better
for a brief moment on our date

13:29.458 --> 13:31.917
and then life pretty much
went back to sucking.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.417
Can we go out again or what?

13:38.583 --> 13:41.291
You know what? I don't...
I don't think so, Roxanne.

13:41.291 --> 13:45.917
Why is it such a big deal
that I'm 20 years old and
live with my parents?

13:45.917 --> 13:49.083
I should be the one freaking out
that you're divorced
with three kids.

13:49.083 --> 13:52.417
- Separated.
- Worse. You're still in limbo.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.583
You're right. You see that?

13:54.583 --> 13:58.500
You should run away as fast as
you can because I'm a walking
time bomb, baby.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.709
- No, you're not.
- No, I'm not.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.000
My friends are going
to Moonlight Rollerway tonight.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.166
Really? What's that?

14:10.166 --> 14:13.333
It's a roller-skating rink.
Kinda old-school.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.750
- Yeah.
- Like you.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.333
Oh, like me.
That's good.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.000
Make me feel better.

14:22.542 --> 14:24.166
I don't... I don't skate.

14:24.166 --> 14:26.250
Neither do I.
That's why it's fun.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.125
OK, then.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.792
- Guess I'll see you around.
- You'll see me around.

14:41.375 --> 14:44.291
I don't think you should
develop that game, Life Sucks.

14:44.291 --> 14:47.750

21:02.542 --> 21:04.458
the '70s and '80s up-tempo

contemporary up-tempo.

- Yeah, that's right.
I'm the closer.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.000
We'll see about that.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.834
Let's see if we can't make
this year the best year ever

22:38.834 --> 22:43.000
and we can do that by working
as a team, all together.

22:43.000 --> 22:46.000
So thanks for coming and
enjoy the rest of your evening.

22:56.542 --> 22:58.834
- Hello?
- Hey, Deen!

22:58.834 --> 23:01.208
We're in here. In the bedroom!

23:02.542 --> 23:05.250
- OK, it's not in here.
- Well, it's in the hall closet.

23:05.250 --> 23:07.375
- What's going on?
- I'm in labor!

23:07.375 --> 23:10.625
- What?
- Yes. I know. It's nuts.

23:10.625 --> 23:13.208
- I'm in labor!
- [both screaming]

23:13.208 --> 23:17.250
[Dave] She's doing great.
Breathing's fine. Contractions
are six minutes apart.

23:17.250 --> 23:20.709
We've called the doctor.
She's on the way to the
hospital, meet us there.

23:20.709 --> 23:22.291
- I got the bag!
- Oh, good!

23:22.291 --> 23:24.583
You know what? Dave, Dave.
Thank you very much

23:24.583 --> 23:27.083
for getting her this far,
but I got it from here.

23:27.083 --> 23:29.542
What? No, no, no, no.
Deena, I'm going with her.

23:29.542 --> 23:31.417
We had this deal
I was gonna help her.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.709
- You didn't tell him?
- Didn't tell me what?

23:33.709 --> 23:36.542
I'm gonna be with her
in the delivery room,
all right?

23:36.542 --> 23:39.792
- Why didn't you tell him?
- I guess 'cause
I went into labor!

23:39.792 --> 23:42.083
I had a lot on my mind.

23:42.083 --> 23:44.125
That's funny.
But here's the thing, OK?

23:44.125 --> 23:46.667
I got the playlists and
the iPod, so she needs me.

23:46.667 --> 23:48.917
- She needs me too.
- I'm gonna get my coat.

23:48.917 --> 23:52.125
- Yeah, you do that, sweetie.
- I am not gonna
miss this, all right?

23:52.125 --> 23:54.417
I will be in that room
with her, so back off!

23:54.417 --> 23:57.208
No, I'm gonna be in there
with her, OK? So you back off.

23:57.208 --> 23:59.417
- You back off.
- No, I'm not gonna...

24:06.208 --> 24:08.458
Come on. Come on.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.458
- Let's take the stairs.
- Stairs. Good idea.

24:13.250 --> 24:15.083
The stairs are this way.

24:16.083 --> 24:18.083
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.500
Well, you can't go to bed yet.
The night's young.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.125
What do you say we go
get a drink? Come on.

24:27.959 --> 24:30.125
- Great banquet, huh?
- Yeah.

24:30.125 --> 24:33.458
You should've seen this guy
when he was a kid, all over
the place.

24:33.458 --> 24:36.625
Football one week, then soccer.
Even got into drama.

24:37.792 --> 24:39.500
- Drama?
- I wasn't into drama.

24:39.500 --> 24:43.291
- Yeah, you were in that play.
- I never did a play.

24:43.291 --> 24:47.000
Yeah, you started to do
that play, and then, oh,
yeah, I guess you fell out.

24:47.000 --> 24:50.250
But you always had a little
problem with commitment
in those days.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.500
You know what?
I'm gonna turn in.

24:55.500 --> 24:57.917
You haven't finished your drink.

24:57.917 --> 24:59.917
I'm done. I've had enough.

25:04.166 --> 25:06.959
- Good night.
- Night.

25:06.959 --> 25:09.834
What do you say we go outside
and have a couple of cigars?

25:09.834 --> 25:13.667
- I got some excellent Cubans.
- What are you doing, Dad?

25:13.667 --> 25:16.208
What do you mean,
what I am doing?

25:16.208 --> 25:19.417
Why are you trying to make me
look like a jerk in front
of Bridget?

25:19.417 --> 25:22.333
I was just telling cute stories
about when you were a kid.

25:22.333 --> 25:24.458
And what's with the drinks
and the cigar?

25:24.458 --> 25:27.959
You got a problem with
a father wanting to spend
some time with his son?

25:27.959 --> 25:31.834
No, if that were true.
Since when do you want
to spend time with me?

25:31.834 --> 25:33.834
Brian, all the time.

25:33.834 --> 25:37.667
You're trying to keep Bridget
and I away from each other.
That's all this is.

25:40.542 --> 25:44.208
This place is kind of dead.
Let's go to the other joint
and have a drink.

25:44.208 --> 25:47.208
- They got live music.
- I'm going to bed now.

25:55.125 --> 25:59.542
Listen, Nicole is my friend.
I should have been the one
to give her the baby book.

25:59.542 --> 26:01.375
I should be the one
driving this car.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.542
And I should be the one
in the delivery room.

26:03.542 --> 26:06.208
Your friend? The reason
you know Nicole is through me.

26:06.208 --> 26:09.208
Because Nicole
is Brian's sister.

26:09.208 --> 26:11.250
I am Brian's friend.

26:11.250 --> 26:15.041
- I met Brian first.
- You didn't meet Brian first.

26:15.041 --> 26:18.417
- I saw him first.
- You saw him first? Who cares?

26:18.417 --> 26:21.208
At the student union
during registration.

26:21.208 --> 26:24.375
- When did you see him?
- [Nicole] I'm having
another contraction.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.000
Aw, Jeez, Dave.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.959
Stopping at a yellow light
does not mean stopping really,
really early.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.750
Just listen to me!

26:31.750 --> 26:35.583
Because these are all my
friends we're talking about,
my best friends.

26:35.583 --> 26:39.250
I don't really get to see
my friends anymore half
the time 'cause of you.

26:39.250 --> 26:42.583
- Great. Keep on breathing.
- Can it with the breathing,
would you?

26:42.583 --> 26:45.875
You two need to shut up, OK?
This is not about you,
it's about me

26:45.875 --> 26:48.625
and I could use a little
support in my labor.

26:48.625 --> 26:52.917
Really. Dave, just step on it,
OK? You're driving like
a grandmother!

26:52.917 --> 26:55.750
OK. We're gonna move right now.
We're getting out of here.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.834
We were actually friends.

28:35.834 --> 28:38.333
You can't claim all these
people as your friends.

28:38.333 --> 28:41.417
- I've known them

- Whatever, Deen.

28:41.417 --> 28:43.959
- Whatever.
- Why are you making
this so difficult?

28:43.959 --> 28:48.166
Difficult? You told Nicole
to tell me I couldn't be
in the delivery room.

28:48.166 --> 28:51.500
That is because I was
supposed to be in the
delivery room with her.

28:51.500 --> 28:54.291
- I shouldn't have
let you drive us.
- Now I can't drive?

28:54.291 --> 28:57.375
Who will you get to drive,
your boyfriend K.T. Tunstall?

28:57.375 --> 29:00.041
He's not my boyfriend.
I've been out with him twice.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.333
That's probably all
I'll ever be out with him.

29:02.333 --> 29:05.417
The other night I went with him
because I needed somewhere to go

29:05.417 --> 29:08.166
because you were
with all our friends.

29:08.166 --> 29:10.083

Excuse me, you know
where Nicole Varzi went?

29:14.417 --> 29:17.083

and Delivery now.
- OK, where's that?

29:17.083 --> 29:19.250
Wait. Which one of us
does she want with her?

29:19.250 --> 29:22.959
- Neither of you.
- We're supposed
to be in the room.

29:22.959 --> 29:25.917
- Are you Dave and Deena?
- Yeah.

29:25.917 --> 29:27.583
Nope. No mistake.

29:27.583 --> 29:29.125
But...

29:34.208 --> 29:36.750
So, what happened?
Did she have the baby?

29:36.750 --> 29:39.417
Wait, aren't you supposed
to be in the delivery room?

29:39.417 --> 29:40.875
Yeah, kinda.

29:40.875 --> 29:43.875
Let me ask you, who was friends
with Nicole first, me or her?

29:43.875 --> 29:46.375
- Oh, please. Don't.
- Just answer the question.

29:46.375 --> 29:47.959
- Just...
- Zip it!

30:31.041 --> 30:33.709
You want me to tell someone
to get you the right bag?

30:33.709 --> 30:36.208
No. Please just bring it
to me. Thank you.

Hey.

31:15.875 --> 31:18.667

it's kind of a crazy
question to ask my wife...

31:56.917 --> 31:58.917

Yeah, I do.

32:17.625 --> 32:19.291

32:19.291 --> 32:22.500
OK, when you say a whole bunch,
how many do you mean?

32:22.500 --> 32:26.625
- Like three?
- Oh, no, nothing like that.

32:26.625 --> 32:28.750
