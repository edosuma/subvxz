<i>Kids,
October of 2012 kicked off</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:05.672
<i>The Autumn of Breakups.</i>

00:05.756 --> 00:08.717
<i>And Barney, having broken
his engagement with Quinn,</i>

00:08.717 --> 00:11.094
<i>was slowly trying
to pick himself back up.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:15.098
Welcome to Bangtoberfest!

00:15.182 --> 00:17.267
Have a Bangtoberfest T-shirt!

00:17.351 --> 00:18.769
I'm back!

00:18.769 --> 00:20.896
Have a Bangtoberfest
T-shirt!

00:20.896 --> 00:22.523
I'm single again!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.441
Sorry about your eye!

00:24.525 --> 00:26.527
I'm available!

00:26.527 --> 00:28.403
"Bangtoberfest:

00:28.487 --> 00:30.948
"This Time It's Really
Not Personal."

00:30.948 --> 00:34.785
Barney, you just went through
some really big emotional stuff.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.703
You need to give yourself
some time to heal.

00:36.787 --> 00:39.540
Robin, I spent
seven grand on merch.

00:39.540 --> 00:43.377
This is happening.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.962
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.421
Hi, Marshall.

00:46.505 --> 00:48.507
So, Lily's dad just showed up

00:48.507 --> 00:50.467
two days ago unannounced.

00:50.551 --> 00:53.178
Remember when I bought all those
Mexican fireworks so I'd never

00:53.262 --> 00:54.555
have to buy
Christmas presents again?

00:54.555 --> 00:56.682
Oh, God,
you blew up the house.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.392
Blew up the house?

00:58.392 --> 00:59.601
Oh, no.

00:59.685 --> 01:00.853
Nothing like that, no.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.897
No, the fireworks
blew up the garage.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.816
The house burned down.

01:05.816 --> 01:07.776
Holy frijoles,
do I smell brownies?

01:09.862 --> 01:11.613
We covered that fire
on the news.

01:11.697 --> 01:15.617
I had no idea "naked man
runs back into inferno

01:15.701 --> 01:18.745
"to rescue potato salad"
was Mickey.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.706
My hour's up.
Your turn, Marshall.

01:20.706 --> 01:22.875
Oh, no.

01:22.875 --> 01:25.836
Baby Marvin,
did you just go poo-poo?

01:25.836 --> 01:27.087
Craziest thing.

01:27.171 --> 01:29.339
He just went poo-poo
this very second.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.883
Are you sure this

01:30.883 --> 01:33.594
poo-poo didn't happen
on your watch

01:33.594 --> 01:35.429
and you just ran out the clock
until it was my problem?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.347
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, right.

01:37.431 --> 01:41.059
What kind of mother lets her son
sit in his own filth

01:41.143 --> 01:43.478
for an extra nine minutes
and 42 seconds?

01:48.400 --> 01:51.904
I got my eye on you, Aldrin.

01:51.904 --> 01:56.241
It's watering right now,
but I got my eye on you.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.120
I can't believe
I have to go back to work

02:00.204 --> 02:02.539
on Monday and we still haven't
found a nanny.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.334
Well, if Grandpa Mickey's there,
couldn't he just...

02:05.334 --> 02:07.085
Are you kidding?

02:07.169 --> 02:09.254
My dad was never there for me
when I was a kid.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.923
And when he was...

02:12.758 --> 02:14.468
What's wrong, Daddy?

02:14.468 --> 02:18.055
Oh, Daddy can't pick a horse
to save his freakin' life.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.975
All I need is
just one lucky number.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.269
Hey, when's your birthday?

02:24.353 --> 02:26.230
Today.

02:26.230 --> 02:28.524
Well...

02:28.524 --> 02:31.568
We've got to find a nanny,
and my dad's definitely not it.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.738
Well, um, and this doesn't solve
your nanny problem,

02:34.738 --> 02:36.949
but if you're in need
of a babysitter,

02:36.949 --> 02:38.325
Nick and I could do it.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.077
We're really clicking
as a couple.

02:40.077 --> 02:44.623
Um, if any couple
is clicking these days,

02:44.623 --> 02:47.167
it's me and Victoria.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.795
Do you think
that you and Victoria

02:49.795 --> 02:51.630
are clicking more than
me and Nick?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.924
Do you think you and Nick are...

02:53.924 --> 02:57.261
Oh, that's precious.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.471
<i>Kids, when
you're in a new relationship</i>

02:59.555 --> 03:01.890
<i>and you're competing
with your ex for who's happier,</i>

03:01.974 --> 03:03.392
<i>it can get ugly.</i>

03:03.392 --> 03:05.727
Anyway, I should get going.

03:05.811 --> 03:08.397
I have to go get
a key made for Nick.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.940
For my apartment.

03:09.940 --> 03:11.108
Ha-burn.

03:11.108 --> 03:12.901
Hey, maybe the locksmith
who made the key

03:12.985 --> 03:14.486
I gave to Victoria
will give you a deal.

03:14.570 --> 03:16.029
Oh, wait, he won't remember me.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.407
It was three weeks ago.
Ha-double burn.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.908
Nick signed for a package
when I wasn't there.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.577
Victoria keeps tampons
at my apartment.

03:21.577 --> 03:23.704
Damn it!

03:36.925 --> 03:38.510
<i>The next day,
Lily and Marshall's</i>

03:38.594 --> 03:40.179
<i>nanny search hit pay dirt.</i>

03:40.179 --> 03:42.264
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen,

03:42.264 --> 03:46.059
I promise to create a safe,
nurturing environment

03:46.143 --> 03:49.563
full of learning,
laughter and love.

03:49.563 --> 03:52.024
So that even when
we have to eat lima beans

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
or we get a boo-boo on our knee,

03:53.984 --> 03:57.362
we know everything
will be just fine.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.072
And do you know why?

03:59.156 --> 04:00.574
Because you're an angel
sent from heaven?

04:00.574 --> 04:03.035
I want to bury my head
in the safety of your bosom.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.038
Because Mrs. Buckminster
is here.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.749
The search is over.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.793
Mrs. Buckminster, we just need
to know your salary.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.754
Oh, delightful!

04:13.754 --> 04:16.256
Well, my weekly fee is...

04:17.758 --> 04:19.051
There, there.

04:19.051 --> 04:22.513
I'm sure you'll find someone
you like just as much.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.182
- No, we won't!
- Not like you!

04:27.601 --> 04:29.228
Hey, Robin,
can I borrow a stamp?

04:29.228 --> 04:32.898
Oh, wait, this wedding
reply card already has one.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.358
Why, you ask?

04:34.358 --> 04:37.569
Victoria and I
are RSVPing to a wedding...

04:37.653 --> 04:39.029
in Jamaica...

04:39.029 --> 04:40.697
six months from now.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.866
Ha-triple burn.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.660
Oh. Jamaica.

04:44.660 --> 04:45.953
Yeah.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.205
That's an island, right?

04:48.205 --> 04:49.831
Depends where you're going
with this.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.584
All the way
to the island of Hawaii.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.044
Why, you ask?

04:54.044 --> 04:56.171
Well, I was invited
to spend New Year's there

04:56.255 --> 04:58.549
last night when I met
Nick's parents.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.552
Ha-aloha burn.

05:01.552 --> 05:04.888
Have you, um,
met Victoria's parents, Ted?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.933
As a matter of fact, I haven't.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.853
Because they're dead.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.813
Are they, Ted?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.940
Are they really dead?

05:14.940 --> 05:16.525
No.

05:16.525 --> 05:18.986
Damn it!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.280
Bangtoberfest is a flop!

05:21.280 --> 05:24.783
I can't think of an innovative way to bang chicks

05:24.867 --> 05:27.286
that properly honors
my return to the game.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.496
Sure, I've tried
some old reliables.

05:29.580 --> 05:32.791
Ten unpaid parking tickets?

05:32.875 --> 05:35.669
I suppose there is one way
I could...

05:35.669 --> 05:39.214
"get you off."

05:39.298 --> 05:40.507
No!

05:40.591 --> 05:43.886
I've used that admittedly
awesome line a thousand times.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.762
You're better than this, Barney!

05:45.846 --> 05:49.683
Well, the evidence
is pretty incriminating, but...

05:49.683 --> 05:53.520
I suppose there is one way
I could "get you off."

05:53.604 --> 05:56.356
Damn it! What?

05:56.440 --> 05:58.609
Bangtoberfest
is about innovation,

05:58.609 --> 06:00.402
about ideas.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.863
Bangtoberfest used
to mean something.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.198
You just
made it up yesterday.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.825
Enough questions.
I need time to think!

06:09.620 --> 06:11.288
So, how's the nanny search
going, Lil?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.664
Lousy.

06:12.748 --> 06:15.626
Mrs. Buckminster
was a spoonful of sugar.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.212
But so far, everyone
we can afford on this Web site

06:18.212 --> 06:22.591
HeyNannyNanny.com
is Scary Poppins.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.468
<i>But Lily and Marshall
needed a nanny,</i>

06:24.468 --> 06:26.553
<i>so they forged ahead
with their search.</i>

06:26.637 --> 06:29.139
So, zero experience
as a nanny?

06:29.223 --> 06:32.392
Right. But in rehab,
I was in charge of the cats.

06:32.476 --> 06:35.103
And only two died,
so I figured...

06:37.940 --> 06:39.650
How do you feel
about spanking?

06:39.650 --> 06:43.403
For eight bucks an hour, you can do
whatever you want to me.

06:43.487 --> 06:44.696
I'm available.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.073
Dad, we know.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.535
I wasn't talking to you.

06:49.535 --> 06:52.120
<i>Finally,
they met Julie Jorgensen.</i>

06:52.204 --> 06:54.915
You're from
St. Cloud, Minnesota?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.208
I'm from St. Cloud.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.502
Really? Oh, you must know
my dad, George Jorgensen?

06:58.502 --> 07:00.838
Of course.
George Jorgensen's Organs.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.256
Last year, my brother
joined the business.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.883
Really? Who knew that Morgan
Jorgensen would go into organs?

07:04.967 --> 07:06.802
- Anyway, Julie...
- Is it still called

07:06.802 --> 07:08.637
George Jorgensen's Organs
or did they change it

07:08.637 --> 07:10.222
to George Jorgensen
and Son Organs?

07:10.222 --> 07:12.850
They changed it to George
and Morgan Jorgensen's Organs.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.309
Guess whose idea that was?

07:14.393 --> 07:16.270
- Morgan's.
- Morgan's.

07:16.270 --> 07:17.771
They just opened a new shop
out of state.

07:17.855 --> 07:19.147
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- Oregon.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.651
- What's that one called?
- Piano Town.

07:22.651 --> 07:24.903
Well, you have experience,

07:24.987 --> 07:28.115
and I think it's safe to say
you have my husband's approval.

07:28.115 --> 07:31.118
- What's your salary?
- Oh, um, it's right there.

07:32.411 --> 07:35.956
Julie, we would love
for you to be our nanny.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.541
Oh, thank you so much.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.710
Um, I just have
one last interview today,

07:39.710 --> 07:41.211
but to be honest,
I can't imagine

07:41.295 --> 07:43.046
liking anyone more
than I like you guys.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.506
Oh...

07:44.590 --> 07:46.717
Okay, bye. Bye.

07:46.717 --> 07:49.136
Yay.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.555
Well, she was a total bitch.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.601
<i>That night,
Lily and Marshall called Julie</i>

07:55.601 --> 07:57.269
<i>hoping she'd accept the job.</i>

07:57.269 --> 07:59.938
I'm so sorry, I can't.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.815
Don't tell us
you took the other job.

08:01.899 --> 08:04.318
No, I didn't.
I'm not taking any nanny job.

08:04.318 --> 08:05.861
I don't understand.

08:05.861 --> 08:07.362
The most amazing thing happened

08:07.446 --> 08:09.448
at my next interview
after you guys.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.408
I fell in love with a single dad

08:11.408 --> 08:13.452
who turns out to be
a billionaire.

08:13.452 --> 08:16.079
Tomorrow, we're heading off
to Paris in his private jet.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.042
It's gonna be, as he would say,
legend... wait for it...

08:20.042 --> 08:22.711
Barney!

08:22.711 --> 08:26.006
Ix-nay on the eal-ray ame-nay.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.509
Mr. and Mrs. Eriksen?

08:28.509 --> 08:31.345
You son of a...

08:31.345 --> 08:32.596
itch-bay!

08:37.851 --> 08:40.604
Look, Barney's our friend,
for some reason,

08:40.604 --> 08:42.898
and everything he
told you was a lie.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.566
But the good news is

08:44.650 --> 08:46.318
you're free to come work for us.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.904
I'm sorry,
I can't nanny for anyone

08:48.904 --> 08:50.781
who's friends with this monster.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.288
Look, I'd offer you guys coffee,

08:58.372 --> 09:00.165
but I have
another nanny interview

09:00.249 --> 09:02.209
in about 15 minutes, so...

09:02.209 --> 09:04.461
Barney, quick question: why
are you interviewing nannies?

09:04.545 --> 09:05.754
Glad you asked!

09:05.838 --> 09:07.172
You guys were all
pressuring me to think

09:07.256 --> 09:10.092
of a revolutionary new way
to get chicks for Bangtoberfest.

09:10.092 --> 09:12.177
And frankly, I was stumped.

09:12.261 --> 09:13.512
Until...

09:13.512 --> 09:16.098
So far, everyone we can
afford on this Web site

09:16.098 --> 09:19.643
HeyNannyNanny.com
is Scary Poppins.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.186
<i>And there it was.</i>

09:21.270 --> 09:24.857
<i>The Big Bro in the sky
had answered my prayers.</i>

09:24.857 --> 09:27.484
Almighty-five. Ow.

09:27.568 --> 09:29.653
I'd introduce
you to little Baby Edgar,

09:29.653 --> 09:32.114
but one, he's napping,

09:32.114 --> 09:36.159
and two, he doesn't exist.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.287
And these nannies
are really falling for this?

09:38.287 --> 09:41.290
Yeah, these toys don't even
make sense for a baby.

09:41.290 --> 09:44.334
You've got an air rifle,
you got the exact race track

09:44.418 --> 09:46.128
with the double loopty-loop
I had as a kid!

09:46.128 --> 09:50.174
Oh, can I open it,
can I open it, can I open it?

09:50.174 --> 09:52.050
What about Baby Edgar's mom?

09:52.134 --> 09:55.637
Oh, that's a sad story.

09:55.721 --> 09:58.557
And in the end,
the coroner's report confirmed

09:58.557 --> 10:01.435
what I already feared:

10:01.435 --> 10:05.981
the female body cannot withstand
that many consecutive orgasms.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.693
I blame myself.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.697
Okay, does anybody have
six nine-volt batteries?

10:16.033 --> 10:19.286
Once I got the nannies
all sympathetic,

10:19.286 --> 10:21.580
I had to check
their qualifications.

10:21.580 --> 10:23.540
I'd like to see how
you handle bath time.

10:23.624 --> 10:26.001
Follow me to the tub.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.336
Should I get the baby?

10:27.336 --> 10:29.588
No.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.590
I'm just gonna take
the batteries

10:31.590 --> 10:35.093
out of these smoke detectors.
Cool? Cool.

10:35.177 --> 10:39.681
Once the interview was over,
I went in for the kill.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.683
You're perfect for the job.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.103
So, congratulations,
you're hi... no.

10:45.187 --> 10:47.022
I can't do this.

10:47.022 --> 10:49.191
I find you very attractive,

10:49.191 --> 10:51.777
and it wouldn't be appropriate.

10:55.531 --> 10:57.449
It wouldn't be appropriate.

11:01.119 --> 11:03.121
It wouldn't be appropriate.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.836
I repeat it,
it would not be appropriate.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.468
It was like taking candy
from an imaginary baby!

11:16.552 --> 11:19.179
Barney, I just went five months
with no help,

11:19.263 --> 11:22.349
and interviewed 92 nannies
before finding one we liked,

11:22.349 --> 11:23.559
and you ruined everything

11:23.559 --> 11:26.228
the night before
I'm supposed to go back to work?

11:26.228 --> 11:29.231
Thank you for being
the most immature person

11:29.231 --> 11:30.524
I have ever met.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.775
Marshall, let's go.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.819
- Five more minutes!
- Now.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.656
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.492
- Mm.
- Mmm.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.743
Mm-hmm. Mmm.

11:44.997 --> 11:47.124
Mmm!

11:47.124 --> 11:49.877
I'll miss you.

11:52.254 --> 11:53.881
Oh! Oh!

11:55.174 --> 11:57.217
Overcompensating a bit?

11:57.301 --> 11:59.928
Why would I need
to overcompensate?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.805
I am...

12:01.889 --> 12:04.600
...deliriously happy
in my perfect relationship.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.687
What about what I just witnessed
not two minutes ago?

12:08.687 --> 12:12.399
How can the Giants
pass on third and one?

12:12.399 --> 12:13.609
Honey, it's okay.

12:13.609 --> 12:16.612
It's the first quarter, and the
Browns are only up by three...

12:16.612 --> 12:19.198
Robin, I don't want
you to fix this.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.868
I just want
to feel heard.

12:22.868 --> 12:24.912
First of all,
the Giants were smart

12:24.912 --> 12:27.080
not to run
on my Dawg Pound defense.

12:27.164 --> 12:28.707
- They suck, Ted.
- I know.

12:28.707 --> 12:30.125
And two,

12:30.209 --> 12:32.377
there is no way
that you like being with a guy

12:32.461 --> 12:33.921
who's so emotional and needy.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.131
You want to dance, Mosby?

12:36.215 --> 12:38.926
Let's talk about yesterday.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.638
Hi! You guys,
I'm so sorry I'm so late.

12:42.638 --> 12:46.934
I'm gonna run upstairs, change,
I'll be back in five minutes.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.019
Take your time, sweetie.

12:52.105 --> 12:53.732
Victoria's a slob!

12:53.732 --> 12:56.652
Well, at least
I'm not dating a girl.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.028
- You know what I mean.
- Hey, you know what?

12:58.028 --> 13:01.281
I-I really appreciate
how sensitive

13:01.365 --> 13:03.534
and in touch he is with his...

13:03.534 --> 13:05.244
God, who am I kidding?

13:05.244 --> 13:09.164
20 bucks says he is crying
in the ladies' room right now.

13:09.248 --> 13:12.751
Well, at least when
he's finished, he's gonna flush.

13:15.546 --> 13:17.881
<i>So, just as Lily
was about to call in sick</i>

13:17.965 --> 13:19.424
<i>on her first day
back to work...</i>

13:26.056 --> 13:27.307
Good morning!

13:27.391 --> 13:31.228
Mrs. Buckminster, hold me
and make everything okay!

13:31.228 --> 13:34.439
I mean, uh,
what are you doing here?

13:34.523 --> 13:38.735
A Mr. Stinson called the agency
and offered to pay my salary.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.864
Wow. Really?

13:41.864 --> 13:44.783
It's a nice gesture,
but I'm still pissed.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.035
He also sent along this.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.038
- Are the batteries...
- Yes,

13:50.122 --> 13:52.457
the batteries are included, dear.

13:52.541 --> 13:55.043
Yes!

13:55.127 --> 13:56.962
Now, off to work, you two.

13:56.962 --> 13:59.798
Mr. Marvin and I
are going to get acquainted.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.300
Great.

14:01.300 --> 14:03.260
I can't wait to hand him off

14:03.260 --> 14:04.970
and-and finally get
some freedom.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.723
You deserve it.
Now hand him over.

14:07.723 --> 14:10.601
Hand him over, yup.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.770
I'll just take little Marvin
off your hands then.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.689
Take him off my hands.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.441
There he goes.

14:17.441 --> 14:21.278
Ready to receive him!

14:21.278 --> 14:23.447
I can't give Marvin
to a stranger!

14:26.575 --> 14:29.036
Okay, somebody who's not
in the middle of a race

14:29.036 --> 14:30.913
should probably go talk to her.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.294
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Buckminster.

14:37.294 --> 14:40.088
We've decided we're not going
to use a nanny after all.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.925
- You're fired.
- Calm down. Lily,

14:42.925 --> 14:44.718
you're just nervous
about spending

14:44.718 --> 14:46.762
your first day away
from Marvin.

14:46.762 --> 14:48.305
That's perfectly normal.

14:48.305 --> 14:50.682
Oh, I am holding
onto you forever,

14:50.766 --> 14:52.643
and when I die,
and become a skeleton,

14:52.643 --> 14:56.688
I'll still be holding you. Yes.

14:56.772 --> 14:57.856
Last night,

14:57.940 --> 15:01.944
Nick cried
when I killed a spider.

15:01.944 --> 15:04.404
You should have brought
that spider over to my house

15:04.488 --> 15:06.323
to feast on the ant colony

15:06.323 --> 15:09.618
breeding on Victoria's
unwashed dishes.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.411
Whoa!

15:11.495 --> 15:13.789
Barney, what
happened to you?

15:13.789 --> 15:16.416
It was a nightmare.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.544
<i>I'm walking down the street,
minding my own business,</i>

15:18.544 --> 15:19.920
<i>and I see one of the nannies</i>

15:19.920 --> 15:21.421
<i>that I interviewed,
and I'm thinking,</i>

15:21.505 --> 15:22.714
<i>"Maybe I can get her
behind a Dumpster</i>

15:22.798 --> 15:24.883
<i>"and interview her again."</i>

15:24.967 --> 15:28.303
<i>But then...</i>

15:28.387 --> 15:32.391
<i>and then...</i>

15:32.391 --> 15:34.935
<i>they were everywhere.</i>

15:34.935 --> 15:36.353
<i>I was surrounded!</i>

15:36.353 --> 15:38.438
Hey. Hi.

15:38.522 --> 15:40.566
Did you really think
you could get away with this?

15:41.984 --> 15:45.445
As a matter of fact,
I did, yeah.

15:45.529 --> 15:48.073
Time for your nap!

15:48.073 --> 15:50.200
I woke up in a Dumpster

15:50.284 --> 15:52.744
covered in diapers.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.204
And I found a pacifier

15:54.288 --> 15:57.249
somewhere I'm not willing to discuss.

15:57.249 --> 15:59.626
What is wrong with me?

15:59.710 --> 16:01.712
You're still
getting over Quinn.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.339
You can't just dive right back
into single Barney mode.

16:04.423 --> 16:06.049
But I can't stop myself!

16:06.133 --> 16:07.342
I'm out of control!

16:07.426 --> 16:09.219
No, I'm not. I'm fine!

16:09.303 --> 16:10.888
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:10.888 --> 16:15.309
that blonde at the bar looks
as loose as my rear molars.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.686
Stop me! Don't stop me!
I'm fine. Help!

16:17.686 --> 16:19.396
Being single's great!

16:23.984 --> 16:27.029
You know, Victoria's messiness

16:27.029 --> 16:29.907
just forces me
to grow as a cleaner.

16:29.907 --> 16:32.451
Totally. And without Nick,

16:32.451 --> 16:35.454
who's gonna hem my pants?

16:35.454 --> 16:37.873
To making
these relationships last.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.792
<i>Both relationships
would implode within the month.</i>

16:41.960 --> 16:43.086
Hey, sweetie.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.631
Hey. Did you guys conk out?

16:45.631 --> 16:47.925
Yeah, I guess we did.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.801
- What time is it?
- 5:00.

16:49.885 --> 16:53.055
Wow. We slept all day!

16:53.055 --> 16:54.223
Quick question.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.016
Um, where's Marvin?

16:56.016 --> 16:58.810
Right here.

17:09.488 --> 17:12.241
Hey, gang.
What's the big whoop?

17:12.241 --> 17:13.450
Marvin!

17:13.534 --> 17:15.077
Dad, what happened?

17:15.077 --> 17:17.663
<i>Well, when I came back
this morning from my jog,</i>

17:17.663 --> 17:19.414
<i>Marshall was gone,</i>

17:19.498 --> 17:22.376
<i>and I couldn't find
Mrs. What's-her-face.</i>

17:22.376 --> 17:26.547
<i>And you two were sawing logs,
so I figured I'd lend a hand.</i>

17:37.599 --> 17:38.684
<i>Then, why did I wake up</i>

17:38.684 --> 17:40.143
holding a monkey?

17:40.227 --> 17:42.354
Well, a little later,
I got kind of hungry.

17:50.821 --> 17:53.657
So I gave him a bath,
and put his diaper rash ointment on,

17:53.657 --> 17:55.784
and fed him strained peas,
not bananas,

17:55.868 --> 17:57.244
'cause he had bananas yesterday,

17:57.244 --> 17:59.204
and I did the laundry,

17:59.288 --> 18:00.497
finished my burrito,

18:00.581 --> 18:02.332
put him down
for his nap at noon,

18:02.416 --> 18:04.960
sterilized the bottles,
and then we just went to the park.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.628
Okay.

18:06.712 --> 18:09.089
Wow. That's incredible.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.175
When did you get so good
with kids?

18:11.175 --> 18:13.343
You know something, honey,
you don't remember this,

18:13.427 --> 18:15.721
but, um, for the first few years
of your life,

18:15.721 --> 18:18.640
your mom worked,
and I was a stay-at-home dad.

18:18.724 --> 18:20.767
I thought Grandma and Grandpa
took care of me.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.102
Well, they visited a lot,

18:22.186 --> 18:24.062
but I was the guy
who took care of you.

18:24.146 --> 18:25.314
You know, America thinks

18:25.314 --> 18:28.233
I ran into that burning house
to get potato salad,

18:28.317 --> 18:31.862
but I actually ran in
to get this photo album.

18:31.862 --> 18:35.365
And potato salad. Sure.

18:44.249 --> 18:47.503
Dad, I never
realized you were...

18:47.503 --> 18:50.005
there for me.

18:50.005 --> 18:52.758
How come there are no pictures
of me after I go to preschool?

18:54.760 --> 18:56.803
Well...

18:56.887 --> 18:59.014
Oh. Okay, well,

18:59.014 --> 19:02.893
have fun on your first day
of preschool, Princess.

19:02.893 --> 19:04.811
Okay. Off you go.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.897
There you go.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.565
Ugh!

19:08.649 --> 19:11.360
How am I gonna make it
to 3:00 without her?

19:15.239 --> 19:18.367
"Belmont Race Track?" Hmm.

19:18.367 --> 19:20.911
I guess it couldn't hurt
to go just once.

19:22.704 --> 19:23.830
Six months later,

19:23.914 --> 19:26.834
guess what gambling addict's thumbs
had metal pins in them?

19:26.834 --> 19:29.419
This guy.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.258
Look, honey, I was a jerk

19:34.258 --> 19:36.468
who wasn't there
for most of your childhood,

19:36.552 --> 19:40.347
and I regret that
every single day of my life.

19:40.347 --> 19:41.557
But I promise you,

19:41.557 --> 19:45.227
I'm here now for Marvin...

19:45.227 --> 19:48.564
if you want.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.482
You're hired.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.734
<i>I look up to you</i>

19:52.818 --> 19:55.529
<i>You don't look down on me</i>

19:55.529 --> 19:57.823
<i>What do you see in me?</i>

19:57.823 --> 20:00.659
<i>Is it oceans of blue?</i>

20:00.659 --> 20:05.706
<i>How do you
make the colors say</i>

20:05.706 --> 20:08.333
<i>In a thousand crazy ways</i>

20:08.417 --> 20:10.419
<i>That in the end</i>

20:10.419 --> 20:13.589
<i>Most things will be okay...</i>

20:16.967 --> 20:18.927
Ten parking tickets, huh?

20:19.011 --> 20:21.680
I suppose there is a way
I could, uh...

20:21.680 --> 20:23.724
"get you off."

20:23.724 --> 20:25.934
Why did I ever doubt a classic?

20:26.018 --> 20:28.145
Now, now, now.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.189
This is exactly the sort of behavior

20:30.189 --> 20:32.941
you hired me to put an end to,
Mr. Stinson.

20:33.025 --> 20:34.193
Off with you, dear.

20:34.193 --> 20:36.069
Go make better decisions!

20:39.781 --> 20:41.325
You're right.

20:41.325 --> 20:43.452
Thanks, Mrs. Buckminster.

20:43.452 --> 20:44.661
You're welcome.

20:44.745 --> 20:47.706
And I'm proud of you
for trying to change.

20:47.706 --> 20:50.918
What you're doing
with these young women

20:50.918 --> 20:53.462
is simply not appropriate.

20:59.301 --> 21:03.222
That can never
happen again.

21:03.222 --> 21:06.475
Oh, pish-posh.
You said that five times ago.
