WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.996
House slaves
will never be gladiators--

00:07.174 --> 00:09.335
something we are
in short supply of.

00:09.510 --> 00:11.091
We need fighting men.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.001
Keys, quickly.
Release them.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.551
- Our ranks swell.
- We will need more weapons.

00:16.725 --> 00:18.590
Gratitude for your kindness.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.305
Know that l have
treasured it.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.687
Is it true?
Did you lay with her?

00:24.858 --> 00:26.189
- Oenomaus--
- ( screams )

00:27.694 --> 00:31.858
I would have you end the life
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

00:32.032 --> 00:35.024
Glaber's own wife
this very night leaves for Rome.

00:40.040 --> 00:41.701
Your men are now mine.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.247
(theme music playing )

01:08.277 --> 01:10.268
Where do you take me?

01:11.780 --> 01:14.567
Please, I am with child.

01:15.576 --> 01:17.942
( men chattering )

01:21.081 --> 01:22.787
Someone approaches.

01:25.419 --> 01:26.784
Follow fucking lead

01:26.962 --> 01:28.918
and do not stray from it.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.017
Come.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.600
What brings you so far
from road, brother,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.682
with one so ripe?

01:47.691 --> 01:49.602
An ancient horse
gone to grass.

01:50.944 --> 01:54.107
The woods offer shorter distance
for my wife to Pompeii.

01:54.281 --> 01:57.318
Shorter by a lifetime,
if tread absent caution.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.450
Spartacus and his fucks set upon a wagon
not far from here recently.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.610
Spartacus?

02:01.788 --> 02:03.949
Perhaps, we should be
on our way, my love...

02:05.459 --> 02:08.041
unless similar misfortune
fall upon us.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.463
It appears it already has.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.167
How did you come by that?

02:12.341 --> 02:14.627
Our horse, when it fell.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.795
You have business there?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.713
Meat and bone
carved for coin.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.757
A butcher?

02:23.935 --> 02:25.766
Mm.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.476
Fine dress for wife of such.

02:30.651 --> 02:32.812
He's a gladiator.
I am the praetor's--

02:49.378 --> 02:50.914
Apologies.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.334
llithyia: Help me!

02:55.509 --> 02:57.670
Somebody help me!

02:57.844 --> 02:59.345
Help me!

03:00.972 --> 03:02.257
Raise voice again,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.674
and lwill hack tongue
from fucking mouth.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.688
Ask any price.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.319
My husband will see it paid
for my return.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.446
( chuckles )

03:20.617 --> 03:22.903
I seek no ransom.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.997
You are going to
rob me of my life?

03:29.167 --> 03:32.034
No.
It is not mine to take.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.586
I could have speared him.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.720
He was beyond your throw.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.007
You know the distance better
than my own hand, do you?

03:47.185 --> 03:50.643
I know many things regarding
the great and powerful Spartacus.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.764
Great and powerful?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.978
And kind and just.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.893
l have peered
into your very heart

03:59.072 --> 04:01.358
and know what it holds.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.119
You would not have found
content so pleasing,

04:08.290 --> 04:10.497
if you had chanced
upon me in my youth.

04:10.667 --> 04:11.702
Mira: Huh.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.833
I stood more animal
than man.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.585
And what tamed
the wild beast?

04:21.136 --> 04:23.001
Your wife, of course.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.545
Apologies.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.088
( footsteps )

04:26.266 --> 04:28.473
(llithyia moaning)

04:32.230 --> 04:35.597
Take the life
of Glaber's woman,

04:35.776 --> 04:37.937
as he took the life of yours.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.028
See end to vengeance

04:43.200 --> 04:45.156
and with it
the suffering of all

04:45.327 --> 04:48.114
caught between you
and such desires.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.052
Lucretia:
I am to blame for her fate.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.009
Had I not broken words
with Gannicus,

05:08.183 --> 05:10.094
he never would have known
llithyia was on the road.

05:10.268 --> 05:12.850
An unfortunate slip
of the tongue.

05:13.021 --> 05:16.263
I thought only to convince
Gannicus of proper path--

05:16.441 --> 05:18.477
to willingly follow
your command

05:18.652 --> 05:20.358
and join the hunt
for Spartacus.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.066
The man is probably in league
with the fucking Thracian.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.982
They were both slaves
under your house, were they not?

05:26.159 --> 05:28.400
Separated by a distance
of years.

05:28.578 --> 05:30.443
They never have met
one another.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.613
That we have knowledge of,

05:32.791 --> 05:34.656
not that it is a thing
of matter now.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.666
Gannicus now holds

05:36.837 --> 05:39.704
my wife and unborn child!

05:39.881 --> 05:41.872
If she yet draws breath.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.507
No, he would not have
risked all

05:44.678 --> 05:47.715
to take her from the city
only to have her life.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.509
She yet lives.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.972
| feel her heart beating
as though it were my own.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.637
Your men must scour the countryside
until she is found.

05:57.816 --> 06:00.307
Such an area takes months to cover
with numbers at hand.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.316
Then send message
to Rome for aid.

06:02.487 --> 06:06.400
Word of this shall not spread
beyond these walls.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.358
But llithyia--

06:10.537 --> 06:13.244
Was snatched from grasp
of a praetor of Rome.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.248
I will not have
the Senate whisper

06:16.418 --> 06:18.955
of how I could not
protect my own wife.

06:19.129 --> 06:21.336
A wise choice.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.883
You must look
towards your future.

06:25.677 --> 06:27.213
You talk of politics?

06:27.387 --> 06:31.881
llithyia is valued friend
and wife.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.892
She holds the blessing
ofyourcth,

06:36.062 --> 06:38.724
and with him slim tether
to Albinius's wealth,

06:38.899 --> 06:40.730
one which will be severed
if she is not found.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.234
Do not lecture on
what is at fucking risk!

06:44.404 --> 06:46.486
Ashur: Praetor.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.275
You have seen it done?

06:51.453 --> 06:54.616
All trace of your wife's
misfortune has been erased.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.246
No one will know of it.

06:58.585 --> 06:59.574
Good.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.368
Gather your men.

07:02.839 --> 07:06.002
Seppia, lwould have
a moment.

07:13.308 --> 07:16.425
Ashur: I would not raise voice
in such manner with him again...

07:18.438 --> 07:20.429
if you wish to keep purchase
in this world.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.472
Absent llithyia's blessings,

07:22.651 --> 07:26.235
it is a place that
I shall quickly tumble from.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.615
I would never let you
fall so far, my love,

07:32.786 --> 07:36.654
not while I yet
treasure your company.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.929
Good.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.965
Now keep eye on angle
of my shoulders.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.974
It will give clue
to my next--

08:15.078 --> 08:16.693
You learn quickly.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.953
l have advantage

08:19.124 --> 08:21.786
of being taught by a god.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.593
Again.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.613
Oenomaus: Harudes,

08:57.787 --> 09:01.075
you betray intent by bellowing
like a crazed goat.

09:06.296 --> 09:08.378
( men laugh )

09:08.548 --> 09:12.086
Nemetes, Saxa,
take position.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.421
Are we to use wooden stick
in battle as well?

09:14.596 --> 09:16.837
Close mouth
and heed Oenomaus.

09:17.015 --> 09:19.802
I need no instruction.
I fucking know how to fight.

09:19.976 --> 09:23.889
l instruct you not how to fight
but how to win,

09:24.064 --> 09:27.522
so you do not find yourself again
enslaved by the Romans.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.558
First position.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.399
Attack!

09:34.407 --> 09:36.443
Nemetes does hold argument,

09:36.618 --> 09:39.360
towards lack of proper
weapons at least.

09:41.247 --> 09:42.828
(crowd gasping, murmuring)

09:42.999 --> 09:44.364
Fuck the gods.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.910
You have taken Glaber's wife?

09:49.089 --> 09:51.876
No. She has been delivered
into my hands.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.915
And they will see her
to proper end.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.255
Woman: Whore!
Beg for your life!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.590
- ( crowd shouting )
Man: ...your fucking throat!

10:00.725 --> 10:02.101
Woman: Whore!

10:02.268 --> 10:04.224
( llithyia whimpering )

10:11.277 --> 10:12.983
Is this our cause now--

10:13.154 --> 10:15.691
falling upon a helpless woman
heavy with child?

10:15.865 --> 10:18.527
Glaber held no pity
towards my wife--

10:18.701 --> 10:20.566
a woman far more deserving
than the thing

10:20.745 --> 10:22.281
that stands before you.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.367
- ( crowd shouting )
- Man: Whore! Whore!

10:25.542 --> 10:27.407
Man #2:
Fucking bitch.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.467
Coin before cunt,
you worthless shit.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.306
Now crawl from sight.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.813
Man: Get up, you old cunt.
( laughing )

10:54.154 --> 10:56.611
Linger yet a while,

10:56.781 --> 10:58.646
my good man.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.700
We'll have the pleasure
of your company.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.487
What do you seek
of me now, Syrian?

11:05.665 --> 11:07.781
Glaber: Gannicus.

11:09.085 --> 11:13.044
A gladiator
of some renown in Capua.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.002
He has been noted
to frequent

11:17.177 --> 11:19.213
your establishment,
has he not,

11:19.387 --> 11:21.002
partaking of wine
and whores?

11:21.181 --> 11:22.842
Yes, Praeto r.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.677
I would have words
with the man.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.341
He is not here.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.471
Then there must be some
among you

11:31.649 --> 11:33.389
who have had cause
to share drink

11:33.568 --> 11:36.230
and other distractions
with him.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.355
I would know
of what he spoke,

11:40.533 --> 11:43.650
towards revelation
of where he secrets himself.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.240
And I would hope
for another fucking drink

11:46.414 --> 11:48.279
and a whore upon my cock.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.792
(crowd murmuring)

11:56.216 --> 11:59.458
Let me ask it of you again.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.754
Who among you has spoken
with Gannicus?

12:12.065 --> 12:13.601
Disappointing.

12:17.487 --> 12:18.897
Wait. Wait.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.939
I did see Gannicus
break words.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.740
Who was privy to them?

12:24.911 --> 12:27.527
My slave Marcia.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.081
Where is she?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.207
Your fucking Syrian
nailed her to a cross.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.835
And l have yet to receive
fair compensation for loss incurred.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.754
Gannicus has taken
something from me!

12:45.932 --> 12:49.220
And I will see it returned.

13:03.866 --> 13:05.572
Put all to question.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.161
Please do not do this.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.958
Were those same words
pleaded by my wife

13:23.136 --> 13:25.969
before Roman blade
ripped her forever from my arms?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.595
I did not know of her.

13:27.765 --> 13:29.756
My hands are
unstained by the deed.

13:31.769 --> 13:33.760
Yourhusband
cannot claim such.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.475
He is the one
that condemned her to slavery.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.355
She is gone from this world
because of it.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.606
And I will have
equalvengeance.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.768
You can not do this.
My child--

13:43.656 --> 13:47.319
Sura and I often spoke
of children,

13:47.493 --> 13:50.530
of the family
we would have,

13:50.705 --> 13:54.323
now forever denied me,

13:54.500 --> 13:56.752
as | now deny Glaber of his.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.910
The child is yours.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.014
You lie.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.845
Would that my tongue
made false noise.

14:13.019 --> 14:16.477
Yet it sounds bitter truth.

14:18.483 --> 14:22.317
Monthly blood ceased after you
came to me in Batiatus's villa.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.443
Lucretia had promised Crixus--

14:27.617 --> 14:29.482
a cruel jest.

14:40.046 --> 14:42.583
of that night,

14:42.757 --> 14:45.624
of you inside me?

14:58.731 --> 15:01.473
Yes,

15:01.651 --> 15:05.439
as does memory
of my hands upon your throat.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.655
Then see to completion
what they began.

15:14.664 --> 15:18.122
Take my life,
and that of your child.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.908
And may your wife turn from you
for what you have done,

15:21.087 --> 15:22.873
when she greets you
in the afterlife.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.957
Oenomaus does not seem lifted
by your return.

16:05.131 --> 16:08.214
I did not think
to be embraced as brother.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.797
Nor l, or to lay eyes upon you
again in this life.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.927
Yet here you stand.

16:14.098 --> 16:17.135
Would that all things were
so easily done.

16:18.936 --> 16:21.348
l have seen the bond
between you.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.638
Whatever the cause
for disagreement,

16:23.816 --> 16:25.602
it will pass.

16:25.776 --> 16:28.734
I would do anything
to rise in his eyes again.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.237
Capturing the praetor's bitch
is a fine start.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.069
( both chuckle )

16:34.243 --> 16:35.824
An impressive act,

16:35.995 --> 16:38.657
sure to further ignite
our cause.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.367
I seek only to end it.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.374
It is done then?

16:53.304 --> 16:54.885
She yet lives.

16:57.600 --> 17:00.012
l brand myself
fucking enemy of Rome

17:00.186 --> 17:02.177
to deliver her to your hands,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.937
only to find them
weak and trembling?

17:06.692 --> 17:09.024
I am not Glaber,

17:09.195 --> 17:10.935
able to strike a woman down

17:11.113 --> 17:13.069
for his crimes
absent misgivings.

17:13.241 --> 17:16.654
And what of the women crucified
in the streets of Capua,

17:16.827 --> 17:19.489
tortured to death because
they dare whisper your name,

17:19.664 --> 17:22.622
eyes bright with thoughts

17:22.792 --> 17:25.534
of freedom and rebellion?

17:25.711 --> 17:29.203
Take her life
and end this now...

17:30.299 --> 17:34.212
or see countless more fall
in the name of your cause.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.845
Lucretia: Prayer alone
will not provide guidance

17:42.019 --> 17:43.725
through these dark times.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.272
We must look inward

17:45.439 --> 17:47.475
and find strength
in heart's resolve.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.976
So the gods turn from you,
as they do from llithyia?

17:52.989 --> 17:55.196
They are always with us,

17:55.366 --> 17:59.325
their will felt
in every breath,

17:59.495 --> 18:01.861
and every touch.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.241
They guide our hands,

18:06.419 --> 18:10.412
compelling us
toward proper course.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.706
Gaius will be pleased
to hear of it.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.385
who holds the key
to llithyia's salvation.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.639
I fear the gods
have led you far astray then.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.174
I command no army,

18:23.352 --> 18:25.638
nor can I conjure
Gannicus before us.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.394
Yet message from you

18:27.565 --> 18:29.977
would bring Varinius from Rome,
and with him--

18:30.151 --> 18:31.937
Gaius was clear
on the matter.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.193
We are to tell no one
of what has happened.

18:34.363 --> 18:36.695
Words born of desperation.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.982
He talks of shoring name

18:40.161 --> 18:43.449
while life's foundation
crumbles beneath his feet.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.410
Seppia.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.499
Seppia.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.332
You sought Praetor Varinius's
affections once.

18:52.506 --> 18:55.964
Send message
and you could yet gain them.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.925
Whims of a child.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.711
Such thoughts
have been set aside

19:00.890 --> 19:04.098
in favor of mature pursuits.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.302
The day has been long.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.517
I will see you
beneath the covers.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.478
We will revisit the subject
with the morning sun.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.814
Apologies.
lam not yet for bed.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.570
I would check upon Gaius
and offer words of comfort.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.484
Are words
all that you would offer?

19:23.496 --> 19:26.329
I am his guest in this house
and wish only to pay tribute

19:26.499 --> 19:28.740
to generous host.

19:28.918 --> 19:32.160
It's beneath you, Seppia.

19:32.338 --> 19:34.124
The gods shall take ill notice.

19:34.298 --> 19:37.005
Was it not their hands that saw
my brother struck from my side,

19:37.176 --> 19:39.167
their providence
that sheltered me

19:39.345 --> 19:40.801
beneath this very roof?

19:40.971 --> 19:42.882
Do you not see it?

19:43.057 --> 19:46.265
The gods have lead me
upon path to Gaius,

19:46.435 --> 19:49.723
as their will has removed
llithyia from it.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.941
A quivering woman,

20:03.119 --> 20:05.030
and with child--

20:05.204 --> 20:07.240
she does not appear
the deadly serpent

20:07.415 --> 20:09.497
you give voice to.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.955
She is wife of the fuck
that would see us all to grave.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.665
Yet not the man himself.

20:16.507 --> 20:19.294
Crixus speaks of how she took
Acer's life

20:19.468 --> 20:22.210
as fucking amusement
of celebration.

20:23.681 --> 20:26.889
Her heart is as venomous
as Glaber's or any other Roman shit's.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.426
A familiar song
bleated from your fucking tongue.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.310
You know my meaning,
Lucius.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.563
And mostly share
in its low estimation.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.476
Yet I would hold ourselves
to higher standard.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.237
Food for deadly prisoner.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.489
Shall I draw her
a warm bath as well?

20:44.702 --> 20:46.567
Consider meal for the child,

20:46.746 --> 20:49.613
unless you fear it shall
take up sword against you

20:49.790 --> 20:52.122
- from fucking womb.
- ( Nasir chuckles )

20:52.293 --> 20:54.284
( Nasir clears throat )

21:03.095 --> 21:06.258
Faded years
soften wounded heart.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.513
( gasps )

21:15.691 --> 21:18.273
Calm yourself.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.685
I intend no harm.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.117
You are the one
that came to aid

21:28.287 --> 21:30.073
when those animals

21:30.247 --> 21:31.748
turned upon me
when lwas brought in.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.373
Do not clutch me to breast.

21:34.543 --> 21:38.502
l shit with the rest
of those animals.

21:38.672 --> 21:41.379
Forcth.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.265
At least you will not die
ofhungen

21:58.526 --> 22:01.188
You bear no brand.

22:02.404 --> 22:04.110
You are a free man?

22:04.281 --> 22:07.444
lam of the Republic,
as you and yours.

22:07.618 --> 22:10.951
Yet you stand
with Spartacus against it?

22:11.121 --> 22:12.702
I stand for what is just.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.488
Just?

22:14.667 --> 22:18.000
Spartacus moves to destroy
everything we hold of worth.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.957
Then he moves too late
in my regard.

22:21.131 --> 22:25.044
Sulla seized my lands
and those of my kin years ago,

22:25.219 --> 22:27.335
slaughtering
any who resisted

22:27.513 --> 22:29.595
and giving
what he stole as gifts

22:29.765 --> 22:31.266
to his most loyal of men,

22:31.433 --> 22:34.971
all of them fellow Romans.

22:36.021 --> 22:40.355
Such a loss must weigh heavy
in the passing of years.

22:40.526 --> 22:43.359
( men chattering )

22:47.366 --> 22:50.483
I would see burden lifted.

22:50.661 --> 22:53.073
( laughs)

22:53.247 --> 22:56.239
And | mistake you for helpless,

22:56.417 --> 22:58.533
yet you have power
to reverse the sun

22:58.711 --> 23:01.043
and see past reformed?

23:03.674 --> 23:05.505
and l of importance to him,

23:05.676 --> 23:07.416
being prized daughter
of my clan,

23:07.595 --> 23:10.553
my child heir to its lineage
and fortune.

23:10.723 --> 23:14.341
Save vaunted words
for grander ear.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.351
( quietly )
I cannot free you.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.764
We would both be absent fucking head
before three steps could be taken.

23:21.942 --> 23:25.400
No, I do not ask such a thing,
only that you carry message

23:25.571 --> 23:28.358
imparting where
Spartacus holds me.

23:30.784 --> 23:33.912
You do not have to
live this way.

23:34.079 --> 23:38.368
All that was taken from you
can yet be restored

23:38.542 --> 23:41.705
with but simple command
from my husband.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.296
The sum of my loss

23:46.467 --> 23:49.049
is no small thing.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.595
He can see it paid,

23:50.763 --> 23:53.004
your life returned to you

23:53.182 --> 23:56.265
in exchange for mine

23:56.435 --> 23:58.801
and the child I carry.

24:03.150 --> 24:05.106
Mira:
She claims it yours?

24:05.277 --> 24:07.609
With passion of certainty.

24:10.366 --> 24:12.448
She is a deceitful
fucking snake,

24:12.618 --> 24:15.109
truth split
by forked tongue.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.778
Her words
may hold such in this.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.617
Do you recall the night
in Batiatus's villa

24:22.795 --> 24:24.376
when you aided in
transforming likeness

24:24.546 --> 24:26.127
into golden Apollo?

24:26.298 --> 24:28.584
To lay with
the Roman woman Licinia.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.295
She wore
the mask of Diana.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.423
Yet beneath
it was not Licinia.

24:41.313 --> 24:42.473
llithyia?

24:43.732 --> 24:44.812
Why did you not
tell me?

24:44.984 --> 24:47.521
What purpose
would it have held?

24:50.948 --> 24:52.358
None.

24:52.533 --> 24:55.491
Nor should it hold
any for you now.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.526
Even if true,

24:57.705 --> 24:59.570
she tells you
only to stay your hand.

24:59.748 --> 25:01.704
She's a fool,

25:01.875 --> 25:05.868
knowing she carries heritage
forever denied my own wife.

25:14.346 --> 25:17.179
See llithyia to her grave...

25:18.392 --> 25:21.350
and tortured past
buried beside her.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.896
To make Glaber suffer
as l have at his hand

25:26.066 --> 25:29.684
is a thing I have craved
more than air and breath.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.359
Yet in inflicting equal wound,

25:34.533 --> 25:37.821
how do | not become
as the man himself...

25:39.705 --> 25:42.993
a man my wife
would turn from?

26:36.845 --> 26:39.302
l was not certain
you would desire this.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.714
What man could not?

26:42.768 --> 26:45.851
It is not the offering
that gave concern,

26:46.021 --> 26:49.764
rather your preoccupation
with unfortunate events.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.434
The fate of my heir
does weigh mind.

26:53.612 --> 26:56.445
And that of your wife's?

26:57.449 --> 26:59.485
A thing of lesser notice.

26:59.660 --> 27:03.369
Is the bond of marriage
really such a cold affair?

27:03.539 --> 27:06.781
There was a time

27:06.959 --> 27:09.496
the love between us
burned hot,

27:09.670 --> 27:11.786
bright as noonday sun.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.956
But day has turned to night...

27:16.176 --> 27:20.260
casting golden memories
to shadow.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.636
lwould have you bask
in the light,

27:25.811 --> 27:27.802
as a man of your worth
deserves.

27:29.648 --> 27:34.312
Albinius did not hold me
to such esteem,

27:34.486 --> 27:36.818
nor the rest of the Senate.

27:39.032 --> 27:42.195
Gaze into their eyes
when you present Spartacus's head

27:42.369 --> 27:44.530
and see estimation soar...

27:48.167 --> 27:50.783
and my brother avenged.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.586
Would that his death

27:58.760 --> 28:01.502
did not pain you so.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.423
The sting lessens
with each passing day

28:05.601 --> 28:07.557
because of you.

28:07.728 --> 28:09.719
And lwould return favor

28:09.897 --> 28:12.513
if your wife falls
prey to Spartacus,

28:12.691 --> 28:15.398
as my brother fell.

28:39.885 --> 28:43.343
Your chest overflows
with coin and blood.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.964
Both well earned
by day's exertion.

28:48.018 --> 28:50.555
What news of llithyia
did labors bring?

28:52.314 --> 28:54.475
You have the praetor's ear.

28:54.650 --> 28:56.231
Did he not already
fill yours?

28:56.401 --> 28:58.733
His attentions
toward young Seppia

28:58.904 --> 29:00.519
prevent me
from breaking words.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.858
Ah...

29:06.036 --> 29:08.493
the freshness of youth.

29:11.124 --> 29:15.083
Is it a wonder he favors
the caress of her tongue

29:15.254 --> 29:17.210
to the sound of yours?

29:17.381 --> 29:20.373
Her bloom will wither
when llithyia returns.

29:20.550 --> 29:24.088
You place great stock
upon uncertain future.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.754
You have not found path
to Gannicus?

29:26.932 --> 29:28.763
Sadly, it remains obscured,

29:28.934 --> 29:31.721
though not through lack
of noble effort.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.396
Where?

29:42.572 --> 29:45.279
From there we moved
from place to place...

29:49.621 --> 29:53.455
questioning with fist
and blade...

30:01.466 --> 30:05.459
the answer always the same.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.379
I will make sacrifice
to the gods

30:08.557 --> 30:11.924
and entreat them
for more valued response.

30:13.937 --> 30:16.679
Let us pray together

30:16.857 --> 30:19.849
and seek divinity
in warm embrace.

30:20.027 --> 30:23.770
llithyia and the child she carries
must be found.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.359
- If they are lost--
- What? Hmm?

30:26.533 --> 30:29.491
Will the sun no longer move
across the sky?

30:29.661 --> 30:33.153
Will ivory moon plummet
into frothing sea?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.323
Strike the bitch
from fucking thought,

30:35.500 --> 30:37.161
as Glaber
has already done--

30:50.390 --> 30:54.508
I am not your slave
to lay fucking hand upon--

30:54.686 --> 30:56.677
a lesson I had thought
already learned.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.516
Apologies.

31:01.151 --> 31:03.187
I question
sincerity of the word.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.398
Speak it again.

31:06.948 --> 31:08.688
Apologies.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.950
- Again.
- Apologies. (whimpering )

31:12.120 --> 31:14.031
Your position in this house
continues to spiral.

31:14.206 --> 31:17.164
Soon I will be all that stands

31:17.334 --> 31:19.575
between you and dark abyss.

31:21.380 --> 31:24.167
When that day arrives,

31:24.341 --> 31:27.504
you shall greet
my breath upon your neck

31:27.677 --> 31:29.963
as precious gift.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.641
Do you understand this,
my love?

31:37.687 --> 31:39.552
Yes.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.063
A gift from the gods.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.571
(thunder crashing )

32:16.893 --> 32:19.270
Lucius.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.303
Where do you go?

32:22.441 --> 32:24.102
To clear troubled mind.

32:24.276 --> 32:25.356
I would have the same.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.768
Let us walk together for a moment
and break words.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.877
The man unleashes wrath
upon wooden form

32:46.047 --> 32:47.708
when l have risked all
for him

32:47.883 --> 32:50.295
to seize vengeance
and end this.

32:51.344 --> 32:54.836
You take risk only to lighten
weighted conscience.

32:55.891 --> 32:58.928
I would not see more fall
to foolish cause.

32:59.102 --> 33:02.014
And I would not
see my brother fall.

33:05.025 --> 33:07.391
We no longer stand as such.

33:08.445 --> 33:10.902
Is there no path
towards mended bond?

33:11.072 --> 33:13.324
You cannot mend illusion.

33:13.492 --> 33:14.823
Our brotherhood,

33:14.993 --> 33:17.655
the trust I placed upon you--

33:17.829 --> 33:21.321
a thing of lies and deceit.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.456
Do you not think
a day passes

33:23.627 --> 33:25.663
that I am not
consumed by it?

33:27.380 --> 33:31.214
lwould give my life
for Melitta to yet own hers.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.885
And I would gladly take it.

33:33.053 --> 33:35.840
Then what stays hand?

33:36.014 --> 33:38.756
Do you and Spartacus
straddle same uncertain ground,

33:38.934 --> 33:41.926
unable to take vengeance
when it is placed before you?

33:43.772 --> 33:48.232
Your death would not
see her again to my arms.

33:48.401 --> 33:51.108
It would only serve as mercy,

33:51.279 --> 33:54.191
releasing you
from what you have done.

33:55.575 --> 33:57.406
Then I stand condemned

33:57.577 --> 33:59.818
till the afterlife takes me.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.996
You stand for nothing,

34:07.170 --> 34:09.832
as you always have.

34:19.558 --> 34:22.220
We must wait till Spartacus
relieves us of charge.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.725
Time passes too slowly.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.886
We must be quick then.

34:39.369 --> 34:41.610
This is how you stand guard?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.829
Apologies. We were--

34:45.000 --> 34:46.536
Agron: Uh, we were--
we were--

34:46.710 --> 34:48.666
- We--
- We were just-- we--

34:48.837 --> 34:50.577
( both laugh )

34:50.755 --> 34:52.586
Take to your bed.

34:52.757 --> 34:54.839
I will assume watch
over llithyia.

35:03.059 --> 35:04.924
- Gratitude.
- ( chuckles )

35:21.828 --> 35:23.614
Please,

35:23.788 --> 35:25.449
I would have more water.

35:25.624 --> 35:29.162
It is a terrible thing,
is it not,

35:29.336 --> 35:31.452
to live in want and fear?

35:33.465 --> 35:36.582
That is what it is
to be a slave.

35:36.760 --> 35:38.842
Please,

35:39.012 --> 35:40.968
for my child.

35:50.482 --> 35:51.722
Is it true

35:51.900 --> 35:53.606
what you told Spartacus?

35:53.777 --> 35:57.315
I swear to the gods.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.901
lf Spartacus takes my life,

36:00.075 --> 36:02.657
the blood of his child
will forever stain his own.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.199
He is a good man.

36:13.797 --> 36:16.209
I will not let him
be destroyed by this.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.624
lwill not let him kill you.

36:19.803 --> 36:22.089
You will help me?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.469
Yes, lwill help you

36:27.644 --> 36:29.885
from this fucking world.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.786
Have you lost mind?

36:53.211 --> 36:55.327
I move only to spare you
from what must be done.

36:55.505 --> 36:58.247
If you take her life,
the deed will weigh every breath.

36:58.425 --> 37:00.006
So you remove choice

37:00.176 --> 37:02.212
and invite such fate
upon yourself?

37:03.722 --> 37:06.714
I would embrace it, to see your heart
spared from the act.

37:06.891 --> 37:09.803
You do not know my heart.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.728
Spartacus.

37:14.899 --> 37:16.685
Leave us.

37:26.703 --> 37:29.240
I would have words now...

37:31.750 --> 37:33.911
and see your time here
at an end.

37:59.736 --> 38:02.728
You glow
like the morning sun.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.238
You must have slept well.

38:05.408 --> 38:07.524
Hardly at all.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.943
It's an unfortunate thing.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.282
I would not deem it so.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.750
I fear you shall.

38:20.465 --> 38:22.001
Out.

38:26.513 --> 38:29.550
I will not have you threaten
in such a manner.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.056
I do not move to threats,

38:32.227 --> 38:35.560
only to warning about the man
you turn affections towards.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.597
Your words will not
turn me from him.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.936
The time for them
has passed.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.148
Come.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.652
l have something more
tangible to show you.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.157
Where is the praetor?

38:49.327 --> 38:50.988
In his chambers.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.278
Lucretia:
What's happened?

38:53.456 --> 38:55.947
A man comes with news
of llithyia.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.665
You claim to have knowledge
of my wife?

39:05.802 --> 39:07.713
More than claim.

39:07.887 --> 39:09.843
She is being held
by Spartacus.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.630
- She lives?
- For the moment.

39:12.809 --> 39:14.219
How do you know this?

39:14.394 --> 39:16.305
l have just traveled
from the rebel's camp.

39:16.479 --> 39:19.266
You stand
as one of his men?

39:19.440 --> 39:22.147
I am no fugitivus,

39:22.318 --> 39:25.560
just a tired old man
seeking what little peace he can

39:25.738 --> 39:27.990
before falling
to eternal slumber.

39:28.157 --> 39:31.285
Well, tell me
where she's being held

39:31.452 --> 39:33.363
and you will be seen
to great reward.

39:33.538 --> 39:37.030
Your wife boasted
of your generosity

39:37.208 --> 39:39.119
and promised
the return of my lands

39:39.294 --> 39:42.536
seized by the bastard Sulla.
ls such a thing possible?

39:42.714 --> 39:45.376
It is within my power.

39:45.550 --> 39:50.214
And what of my own wife,

39:50.388 --> 39:52.504
my children,

39:52.682 --> 39:54.218
my brothers and sisters,

39:54.392 --> 39:56.599
all slaughtered
in the name of Rome?

39:56.769 --> 39:59.226
Is it within your power
to return them to me too,

39:59.397 --> 40:00.728
you fucking cunt?

40:00.899 --> 40:04.983
Lay a hand on me
and your wife dies.

40:08.364 --> 40:11.777
If I do not return
within reasonable hour,

40:11.951 --> 40:14.033
she dies.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.194
Any attempts to follow me--

40:18.124 --> 40:20.080
she dies.

40:23.755 --> 40:26.246
What would Spartacus
have of me?

40:26.424 --> 40:27.584
Gaius.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.177
Speak.

40:31.429 --> 40:34.171
You are to enter
the city of Atella on foot,

40:34.349 --> 40:36.556
just before rise
of morning sun,

40:36.726 --> 40:38.933
three of your men
allowed by your side,

40:39.103 --> 40:40.764
Spartacus to hold the same.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.099
And llithyia?

40:42.273 --> 40:44.605
She will be returned
to you afterwards

40:44.776 --> 40:48.143
in exchange
for a single wagon

40:48.321 --> 40:50.733
heavily weighted
with armor and weapons.

40:50.907 --> 40:53.523
Give arms
to the enemies of Rome?

40:53.701 --> 40:56.283
That is his price.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.945
And if your troops are seen
on the road to Atella,

40:59.123 --> 41:00.738
Spartacus will not appear

41:00.917 --> 41:03.124
and your wife
and the child she carries

41:03.294 --> 41:06.286
will be lost to you forever.

41:12.804 --> 41:16.388
Did I mention the part
about laying hands upon me?

41:18.351 --> 41:20.342
Let him pass.

41:31.823 --> 41:33.063
I do not trust this.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.651
Nor l.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.782
Yet action must be taken.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.659
Prepare a wagon.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.162
Praetor, we can not aid them

41:41.332 --> 41:43.994
with means to forge
further war upon us.

41:44.168 --> 41:46.830
What choice
has Spartacus left?

41:47.005 --> 41:49.371
There are always choices.

41:50.883 --> 41:53.010
No.

41:53.177 --> 41:56.169
Spartacus leaves but one path

41:56.347 --> 41:58.884
and I must travel upon it.

42:03.771 --> 42:06.854
lam old but not a fool.

42:07.025 --> 42:09.937
It was much to ask--
entering the lair of the beast.

42:10.111 --> 42:11.692
Oh, it was
a great pleasure

42:11.863 --> 42:13.694
to piss in the face
of a fucking praetor.

42:13.865 --> 42:15.856
Spartacus.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.400
Glaber agrees to the terms?

42:19.412 --> 42:22.028
I am for Atella,
to see it done.

42:22.206 --> 42:23.582
Yeah!

42:23.750 --> 42:26.833
Let us take his weapons
and his fucking life!

42:27.003 --> 42:29.415
- Yeah!
- No.

42:29.589 --> 42:32.046
If we do not honor word,
we prove ourselves

42:32.216 --> 42:35.458
no better than the Romans.
We shall hold to it.

42:38.973 --> 42:41.055
If three are all
that can be seen with you,

42:41.225 --> 42:43.136
I would count myself
among them.

42:43.311 --> 42:45.848
As would I,
despite the company.

42:47.190 --> 42:48.726
lwould join as well.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.607
I would welcome no one
as warmly,

42:51.778 --> 42:54.565
yet you have not healed
from ordeal in the arena.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.730
lwould stand in his place.

42:58.242 --> 43:00.233
For a cause
you do not believe in?

43:00.411 --> 43:02.823
Oenomaus believes in it.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.409
Perhaps one day I shall too.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.705
Return with proper weapons

43:10.880 --> 43:12.416
and your lives.

43:14.425 --> 43:17.087
It is madness to place trust
in the words of Glaber.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.589
I do not place it with him.

43:22.767 --> 43:25.383
| place it with all those
I take with me.

43:27.814 --> 43:31.056
We will see this done
together

43:31.234 --> 43:33.395
and gain means
to strike Glaber

43:33.569 --> 43:35.776
and his army
from this world!

43:35.947 --> 43:38.438
( crowd cheers )

43:42.120 --> 43:44.111
( clucking )

44:02.598 --> 44:04.884
Spartacus!

44:29.375 --> 44:32.162
The old man claims
you have my wife.

44:36.299 --> 44:38.381
Cut from her dress,

44:38.551 --> 44:41.167
her scent yet upon it.

44:52.190 --> 44:56.229
A thing easily taken
from a body robbed of life.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.893
My thoughts turned
toward such a thing--

44:59.071 --> 45:02.859
blade parting flesh,

45:03.034 --> 45:05.992
her blood upon the ground,

45:06.162 --> 45:09.450
as my wife's blood
was spilled.

45:11.709 --> 45:14.246
Yet you do not claim
her life.

45:14.420 --> 45:16.160
lam not you.

45:16.339 --> 45:18.625
I will not strike down
a woman

45:18.799 --> 45:21.882
for the foolish acts
of her husband.

45:22.053 --> 45:26.513
You carved my name
into a dead man's chest,

45:26.682 --> 45:29.765
make attempt against my life
in the streets of Capua

45:29.936 --> 45:32.222
and then again
in the arena,

45:32.396 --> 45:35.433
yet you turn from
most assured opportunity

45:35.608 --> 45:37.064
to balance debt
between us.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.442
I turn from nothing.

45:39.612 --> 45:42.854
One day soon
I will have your life.

45:44.825 --> 45:47.908
Bring the wagon forward.

45:50.331 --> 45:53.368
I hold many regrets

45:53.542 --> 45:58.036
since first we laid eyes
on each other a lifetime ago.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.716
I pray this decision
does not stand amongst them.

46:12.061 --> 46:15.224
You will hold your wife again.

46:15.398 --> 46:17.309
And she will deliver you
an heir.

46:17.483 --> 46:20.190
Yet when you gaze
into the child's eyes,

46:20.361 --> 46:24.274
I will forever be
reflected there...

46:26.742 --> 46:31.452
in memory
of how I spared them both.

46:33.165 --> 46:34.996
I fear you are right.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.829
You are not like me.

46:38.004 --> 46:41.212
Your wife was the heart

46:41.382 --> 46:43.088
that beats within your breast.

46:43.259 --> 46:46.251
You would have given all
to see her live...

46:48.264 --> 46:52.098
while I would do the same

46:52.268 --> 46:53.849
to see you dead.

47:05.531 --> 47:07.032
Kill them!

48:10.179 --> 48:11.385
Now!

48:24.276 --> 48:25.436
Take cover!

48:31.909 --> 48:33.319
Glaber: Salvius!

48:33.494 --> 48:34.779
Give call!

48:36.288 --> 48:38.279
( blowing loudly)

48:38.457 --> 48:40.698
( several horns answering )

48:42.586 --> 48:44.747
(several horns playing )

49:14.493 --> 49:15.824
Spartacus:
Fall back.

49:25.171 --> 49:27.002
You waited long enough
to give signal.

49:27.173 --> 49:29.004
Spartacus:
l cling to honor ignored.

49:29.175 --> 49:30.460
Quickly, before
they recover.

49:32.344 --> 49:34.881
Take to foot.
I would stay awhile.

49:35.055 --> 49:37.011
Spartacus: Lucius.

49:38.392 --> 49:41.475
Lucius: Go,
before I come to fucking sense.

50:03.542 --> 50:05.999
At least it's not a fucking Roman
that takes--

50:12.718 --> 50:14.709
Man: Do not let them
reach the woods!

50:14.887 --> 50:16.718
Go! Go!

50:23.729 --> 50:26.345
You never intended
to make trade?

50:26.524 --> 50:29.641
I intended to send
Spartacus to his death--

50:29.818 --> 50:32.150
deserved fate he yet evades

50:32.321 --> 50:34.403
through treachery and deceit.

50:34.573 --> 50:36.188
You will have him
soon enough.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.903
At price of wife,

50:38.077 --> 50:39.988
and the blessing
she carries.

50:40.162 --> 50:42.539
I would gladly pay
the sum of the world

50:42.706 --> 50:44.867
to have his throat
beneath my heel.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.909
llithyia must return
to this house.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.544
The gods have--

50:50.714 --> 50:51.749
( glass crashes )

50:51.924 --> 50:53.880
The gods can descend
from their fucking heavens

50:54.051 --> 50:55.791
if they wish
to see her live!

51:00.683 --> 51:03.265
ln coming days I shall grieve

51:03.435 --> 51:05.175
the loss of wife and child

51:05.354 --> 51:08.266
and the fortunes
carried upon her family name.

51:08.440 --> 51:10.931
And we shall grieve
with you.

51:16.448 --> 51:19.064
I would see myself to bath

51:19.243 --> 51:22.406
and blood and troubled thoughts
of moment washed away.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.697
Go. lwill bring more wine
to aid endeavor.

51:40.848 --> 51:42.839
(humming a tune)

51:47.813 --> 51:49.849
Do you know
what he's done?

51:51.483 --> 51:53.815
What he felt he must,
to see an end to Spartacus.

51:53.986 --> 51:56.978
He has pulled the world
to ruin,

51:57.156 --> 51:59.397
and with it
reason for living.

51:59.575 --> 52:01.156
Your reason perhaps.

52:01.327 --> 52:03.409
My heart yet beats.

52:03.579 --> 52:05.240
And what of
your brother's?

52:06.332 --> 52:08.664
Gaius moves
to avenge his death.

52:08.834 --> 52:12.622
Then he should turn wrath
upon himself...

52:14.006 --> 52:15.587
and see it done.

52:23.807 --> 52:26.139
It's your brother's, is it not?

52:26.310 --> 52:28.767
I had thought his slaves
took it with his life.

52:28.937 --> 52:32.429
They stand blemished
by neither offense.

52:32.608 --> 52:35.020
How did you come by this?

52:36.070 --> 52:39.528
The gods
led me to the truth,

52:39.698 --> 52:42.690
hidden amongst
Ashur's treasures,

52:42.868 --> 52:44.574
stripped from the bodies
of those

52:44.745 --> 52:46.736
who have died at his hand.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.120
Ashur?

52:48.290 --> 52:49.700
He must have been there
that night,

52:49.875 --> 52:52.366
when your brother fell.

52:52.544 --> 52:54.671
Yet the villain moves
only upon command

52:54.838 --> 52:58.831
of Gaius Claudius Glaber.

53:08.060 --> 53:10.392
Glaber:
Much has been lost--

53:10.562 --> 53:13.269
the ones we have loved,

53:13.440 --> 53:17.479
the ones we thought
would forever be at our side.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.270
But in their passing,

53:21.448 --> 53:23.939
the chains that bound us
to desires not our own

53:24.118 --> 53:26.404
have been struck.

53:26.578 --> 53:29.536
And without such a blow,

53:29.707 --> 53:32.073
we would not find ourselves

53:32.251 --> 53:34.617
in each other's arms.

53:36.505 --> 53:38.587
No.

53:38.757 --> 53:40.839
We would not.

53:44.763 --> 53:46.799
( llithyia whimpering )

53:49.435 --> 53:51.096
Kneel.

53:53.397 --> 53:55.137
Please.

53:58.068 --> 54:00.400
Do you know what it is

54:03.157 --> 54:06.991
to be filled
with light and hope,

54:07.161 --> 54:10.949
to see that blessing
returned in kind

54:11.123 --> 54:13.830
in the eyes of the only one

54:14.001 --> 54:16.868
that could ever know
the true depth of your heart?

54:33.771 --> 54:36.262
That is what your husband
took from me.

54:44.782 --> 54:46.818
I would take the same
from him.

54:49.453 --> 54:51.239
Yet...

54:51.413 --> 54:54.405
he chose vengeance against me
over your life.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.001
Taking it would balance nothing.

55:08.055 --> 55:11.798
He does not love you

55:11.975 --> 55:14.352
as I loved my wife.

55:24.363 --> 55:25.853
You let me live?

55:29.076 --> 55:31.317
Do not think it a kindness.

55:41.505 --> 55:42.995
(sobs)

55:44.842 --> 55:46.878
(theme music playing )
