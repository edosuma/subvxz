00:08.100 --> 00:10.500
- Oh, heads up, Jillian.
Coffee is for closers.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.233
- Well,
I don't even drink coffee.

00:13.333 --> 00:15.167
- Mm, well, actually,
sweetheart, bagels--

00:15.267 --> 00:16.467
also for closers.

00:16.567 --> 00:18.233
Mmm.
That's not very good.

00:18.333 --> 00:20.233
- Sugar-free vanilla creamer,
also for--

00:20.333 --> 00:21.567
I'm sorry,
I don't remember your name,

00:21.667 --> 00:23.200
but I think you know
what I was about to say,

00:23.300 --> 00:25.167
and the word is "closers."

00:25.267 --> 00:27.633
- All right, everyone,
come and have a seat, please.

00:27.733 --> 00:30.200
- It's for closers.
- Yeah, we're closers, so...

00:30.300 --> 00:32.800
- All right, everyone, we have
a very special guest today.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.867
Let me introduce
Sigourney.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.733
- Thank you, Alice.
- You're welcome.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.533
- Hi, everybody.
I'm Sigourney Goulet.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.033
Most of you know me
as the product rep from MenCo.

00:42.133 --> 00:45.233
For years, we've had products
such as...

00:45.333 --> 00:48.867
men's intimacy
endurance spray.

00:48.967 --> 00:52.767
Well, we are going to just throw
all of that in the trash...

00:54.767 --> 00:58.167
Because today
we're no longer MenCo.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.733
We are now...

01:00.833 --> 01:02.467
FemCo!
- Huh?

01:02.567 --> 01:04.733
- The future leaders
in feminine retail.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.733
- That's right, ladies, huh?

01:06.833 --> 01:09.367
- And the very first product
that we're gonna bring to market

01:09.467 --> 01:13.067
is the Boobillow.

01:13.100 --> 01:17.167
The Boobillow is an ergonomic
wedge-shaped pillow

01:17.267 --> 01:19.367
that allows
very large-breasted women

01:19.467 --> 01:22.300
to sleep comfortably
on their stomachs.

01:22.400 --> 01:24.067
- [clears throat]
- Yes?

01:24.100 --> 01:25.267
- Hi, um, question--

01:25.367 --> 01:27.067
just to be clear...
- Yes.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.533
- So you're telling us
we are allowed to call women

01:30.633 --> 01:34.533
and talk to them
about their breasts?

01:34.633 --> 01:38.067
- Well, yes, but when dealing
with a sensitive subject--

01:38.100 --> 01:40.200
[all cheering]
- Cool!

01:40.300 --> 01:42.133
- We finally get
to talk titties at work.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.167
- All right!
- Yeah, baby!

01:44.267 --> 01:46.367
- Dude, I'm gonna call my dad.
- You got to. You have to.

01:46.467 --> 01:47.967
I'm gonna try to contact
my father.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.600

01:54.700 --> 01:56.600
* You gotta, we gotta,
you gotta *

01:56.700 --> 02:00.067
* Gotta be fresh

02:00.100 --> 02:02.200
- Dudes, dudes, dudes,
check it out.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.533
I got a girl on here who wants
to buy two Boobillows--

02:04.633 --> 02:08.233
One for her and one
for her sister with back issues.

02:08.333 --> 02:11.333
- Hey, that lady's back issue
is giving me a front issue

02:11.433 --> 02:12.900
that's gonna require a ton
of tissue.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.500
[laughter]

02:14.600 --> 02:16.967
- I get it. Like ejaculation.
- Yeah, to clean up.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.500
- Oh, dude,
that is funny, dude!

02:19.600 --> 02:22.400
- Yes, um, what size
are your breasts?

02:22.500 --> 02:25.733
Are we talking kumquats
or grapefruits?

02:25.833 --> 02:28.067
And be honest.
You're on speakerphone.

02:28.167 --> 02:29.667
Hello?
- Hello?

02:29.767 --> 02:31.567
- What you working with, girl?
[line clicks, dial tone]

02:31.667 --> 02:32.933
- Okay, I think I lost her.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.233
[laughter]
Lost another one!

02:34.333 --> 02:35.933
- We're gonna lose many more.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.067
- Oh, I thought
it was gonna break.

02:38.100 --> 02:40.333
Oh, man, yesterday
was so frickin' awesome, right?

02:40.433 --> 02:42.100
- Yeah.
- I love my job.

02:42.200 --> 02:44.133
I love my life, and dare I say
I love my friends?

02:44.233 --> 02:45.600
- Oh, man,
I love you right back.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.067
Dude, I got a girl's number
yesterday.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.500
- What?
- Yeah, from my list of leads.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.467
- But you got it.
- Yeah, and I texted it.

02:51.567 --> 02:52.933
And now it's just
a waiting game.

02:53.067 --> 02:57.600
[indistinct chatter]

02:57.700 --> 02:59.900
- Hey, guys, over here...

03:00.067 --> 03:01.333
now.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.067
Well...
[sighs]

03:05.100 --> 03:07.700
You guys were all terrible
yesterday--

03:07.800 --> 03:10.867
awkward, creepy,
and with total sales of zero.

03:10.967 --> 03:13.067
Luckily, all the saleswomen
in the office killed it.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.767
So that's why
I'm transferring more women

03:14.867 --> 03:17.067
from other departments
to take over your call lists.

03:17.133 --> 03:20.067
- First they take
"Ghostbusters," now our phones?

03:20.133 --> 03:23.800
- Okay, Alice, what are we
supposed to do, then, huh?

03:23.900 --> 03:27.133
- From this point on,
all men are support staff.

03:27.233 --> 03:29.767
- Okay, well, she's lucky
I don't have my bo staff.

03:29.867 --> 03:32.233
- I'm sorry.
What was that?

03:32.333 --> 03:34.100
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.233
- I'm sure--he was--
what you were trying to say was,

03:37.333 --> 03:40.767
like, if these were
guy-centric products, right,

03:40.867 --> 03:42.367
we'd be selling the crap
out of them, Alice.

03:42.467 --> 03:44.267
It's just this stuff,
we don't--

03:44.367 --> 03:46.567
Can I have one moment?
- No.

03:46.667 --> 03:48.633
- Just give me one moment.
- No--Don't touch me. Fine.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.800
- Just give me one moment.
- Ugh.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.933
- I just want a moment.
We just want one moment.

03:53.067 --> 03:54.733
What moment are we doing?

03:54.833 --> 03:56.533
- We're gonna do...
- We're doing that?

03:56.633 --> 03:57.867
- [whispering]
Yes, it's fine.

03:57.967 --> 03:59.867
- Premature ejaculation

04:00.067 --> 04:04.067
is the number-one problem facing
the American penis today.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.800
But with the male intimacy
endurance spray,

04:06.900 --> 04:10.167

four times...

04:11.867 --> 04:13.600
- Close it down.
Get underneath.

04:13.700 --> 04:16.567
- And I guess it'll take
a few seconds to kick in.

04:16.667 --> 04:19.100
- He just touched his ding-dong.
- Ticktock, ticktock.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.067
Adam, go ahead
and kick me in the dads.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.433
It's show-and-tell, baby.
- Really?

04:23.533 --> 04:25.067
- Yeah, man,
we're selling these people.

04:25.167 --> 04:26.533

04:26.633 --> 04:29.567

- Ow, you spit your gum.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.567
That was awesome.
That was cool.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.267
- Another
satisfied customer.

04:33.367 --> 04:34.900
- I'd like to give it a shot.
- [grunts loudly]

04:35.067 --> 04:37.833
- [laughing]

04:37.933 --> 04:39.533
I'm left-handed.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.733
- [straining]
And I'm all good. I'm fine.

Whoa.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.067
- Whoa, did you time
out that ding?

04:47.133 --> 04:48.700
- No, I think somebody
got a text.

04:48.800 --> 04:50.567
- That was incredible!
- Put them on vibrate, please.

04:50.667 --> 04:52.767
- Yeah, put them on vibrate.
This is a presentation.

04:52.867 --> 04:54.733
- So do you want us to get
on the phones now or...?

04:54.833 --> 04:56.367
- No. But I am going
to sleep better at night,

04:56.467 --> 04:58.100
knowing that you
can't have children now.

04:58.200 --> 04:59.533
- Ooh.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.967
- Okay, Alice.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.633
Hello. Excuse me.

05:02.733 --> 05:04.667
- I need my first cup
of coffee ever, immediately.

05:04.767 --> 05:07.467
- Blake, you heard her.
Go get some coffee.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.533
- Are we gonna get those leads
anytime soon?

05:09.633 --> 05:11.300
- Go fetch, Stretch.
Move it.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.633
- Okay, Alice,
hey, real quick,

05:13.733 --> 05:16.500
I know that Jillian
is on the phones now,

05:16.600 --> 05:18.467
so you will need
a new assistant, right?

05:18.567 --> 05:20.633
- You know what?
Fine. I will think about it.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.833
But for now,
you're a floater.

05:22.933 --> 05:25.833
- Ew.
Was that a poop joke?

05:25.933 --> 05:27.900
- No, of course not.
- [sighs]

05:28.067 --> 05:31.467
Okay, good, 'cause just know
that I hate poop jokes.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.533
All right, this is working out
great so far.

check out my new assistant.

is it garbage day?

05:46.967 --> 05:49.067
'Cause, uh, it looks like
someone took the junk

05:49.167 --> 05:50.400
out of your pants.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.067
[laughter]

05:52.100 --> 05:54.300
- But, hey,
peep that caboose.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.733
- Oh.
- Ooh.

05:55.833 --> 05:57.900
- Oops.
- Uh-oh.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.733
- Whoopsy-daisy.
Could you get it for me, Blake?

06:00.833 --> 06:03.767
- Of course. Of course.
- Thanks, Blake.

06:03.867 --> 06:05.567
- [grunts]

06:05.667 --> 06:09.067
- Ooh.
Okay, turn, so I can see.

06:09.167 --> 06:12.067
Turn, turn, yeah.
Turn--And pivot.

06:12.133 --> 06:15.367
- Oh, yeah.
- That's where it's at.

06:15.467 --> 06:17.233
[laughter]
- Lower.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.567
- Excuse me?

06:18.667 --> 06:20.300
- Lower.
- Yeah.

06:20.400 --> 06:21.967
- And now in.
- In?

06:22.067 --> 06:23.267
- Yeah.
In, but down.

06:23.367 --> 06:25.133
No, no, no,
spread the legs more.

06:25.233 --> 06:27.133
Spread as much as you can.
- I'm--Yeah, that's about--

06:27.233 --> 06:29.200
- And now just--
and now just [bleep] it.

06:29.300 --> 06:31.267
- Okay.
- Now just [bleep] the ground.

- Okay.
- Pop it! Pop it!

06:33.633 --> 06:36.933
Pop it and dip it in!
In! In!

06:37.067 --> 06:39.133
In!

06:39.233 --> 06:41.467
I'm done.
- What?

06:41.567 --> 06:44.333
- You can leave now.
- All right, sorry.

06:46.533 --> 06:49.267
- [chuckles] Hello, ladies, got
some hot, fresh leads for you.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.633
- Oh, yeah, for us?

06:50.733 --> 06:52.367
'Cause we do
your job now, right?

06:52.467 --> 06:55.133
- Anyway, if you guys ever
wanted any pointers, sisters,

06:55.233 --> 06:56.833
feel free to bend my ear, and--

06:56.933 --> 06:58.600
- Oh, please enlighten us.

06:58.700 --> 07:00.500
- Yeah, that'd be great.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.167
- Make a sa--
Oh, cool, yeah.

07:02.267 --> 07:03.700
I'll make a sale. Yeah, I mean--
- Oh, yeah, come on.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.533
- Yeah, I want to see that.
See what you got.

07:05.633 --> 07:07.100
- Watch how it's done.
- We haven't been able to.

07:07.200 --> 07:09.833
- Yeah, okay, can I call Marcia?
Is that cool?

07:09.933 --> 07:11.667
- Yeah, Marcia's next.

07:11.767 --> 07:13.600
- I'm actually not getting
a dial tone.

07:13.700 --> 07:15.500
That's weird.

07:15.600 --> 07:18.700
- Could be because you're not
a salesman, bitch.

07:18.800 --> 07:19.933
Now get!

07:20.067 --> 07:22.500
[laughter]

07:22.600 --> 07:25.900
- You didn't even plug it in?
- No, it wasn't plugged in.

07:26.067 --> 07:27.767
- [all speaking at once]

07:27.867 --> 07:31.500
[laughter]

07:31.600 --> 07:34.267
- Good afternoon, ladies!

07:34.367 --> 07:35.900
Chocolate for you,
chocolate for you.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.767
Sorry about the new attire.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.267
I spilled a little coffee
on myself.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.567
Had to borrow a spare
from my main man, Rob.

07:41.667 --> 07:43.333
Ooh!

07:43.433 --> 07:45.900
Hey, just let me know
if you need anything from me

07:46.067 --> 07:47.900
using my strength
or my muscles.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.967
Fresh mail. Hot off the boat.
- Thank you.

07:51.067 --> 07:52.667
- Hey, I know what you're
thinking--

07:52.767 --> 07:57.100
"Is this guy Alice Murphy
assistant material?"

07:57.200 --> 08:00.533
Well, I'm about to prove to you
that I would.

08:02.067 --> 08:04.500
Excuse me, sales angels!

08:04.600 --> 08:08.633
I've arranged
a special beef tenderloin lunch

08:08.733 --> 08:13.067
that I will be serving myself
in the break room at noon.

08:13.133 --> 08:15.733
Who's hungry?
Thank you.

08:15.833 --> 08:17.500
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.700
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.833
If you feed 'em at work, they
won't take an hour for lunch.

08:22.933 --> 08:25.067
- Oh, I never suspected
you had a brain.

08:25.167 --> 08:28.067
- I just want to use my muscles
and my mind

08:28.100 --> 08:30.700
and open up shop right here
and be your number-one guy,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.167
using my muscles and my mind.

08:33.267 --> 08:35.067
- All right, well,
I'll think about it.

08:35.100 --> 08:38.233
But for now, let's just keep you
at my, like, number-20 guy.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.967
- I'll live with that.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.867
- Ah, these women, my gosh.

08:43.967 --> 08:45.867
Can't live with 'em, can't...

08:45.967 --> 08:47.700
[urine splashing]
[sighs]

08:47.800 --> 08:50.500
Have sex with 'em,
'cause they don't like me.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.467
Whatever.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.200
- Hey, Blake.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.800
- Jillian?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.333
- Keep "potty-ing."

09:01.433 --> 09:04.367
Hey, you know
what I was thinking?

09:04.467 --> 09:06.133
You would look
so much prettier

09:06.233 --> 09:08.433
if you wore your hair up
in a bun.

09:08.533 --> 09:12.167
Oh, the nape of your neck
is so elegant.

09:12.267 --> 09:14.433
You know what, Blake?

09:14.533 --> 09:16.100
I like a man bun...

09:16.200 --> 09:19.300
Up top and on bottom.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.967
- [gasps]

09:21.067 --> 09:24.333
- So shake-a da wee-wee
off-a da pee-pee

09:24.433 --> 09:27.167
and go get me a coffee.

09:27.267 --> 09:29.567
[moans]

09:37.267 --> 09:39.333
- She gone?

09:39.433 --> 09:40.600
- Who's in here?

09:40.700 --> 09:42.333
[toilet flushes]

09:42.433 --> 09:44.133
- You can't stand
for that bull[bleep]!

09:44.233 --> 09:46.667
It's time to fight back
for men's rights.

09:46.767 --> 09:48.600
- I can't fight a woman, Bill.

09:48.700 --> 09:50.133
She'd kick my ass.

09:50.233 --> 09:51.800
- Well, you know what I'd do?

09:51.900 --> 09:55.167
Poo in a plastic bag,
flatten it out like a pancake,

09:55.267 --> 09:57.500
stick it in the freezer
for a few hours.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
You know how those bitches
always leave their windows

09:59.700 --> 10:01.300
cracked open
in the Rancho heat?

10:01.400 --> 10:05.167
You slide the poo disc
through Jillian's window,

10:05.267 --> 10:08.000
and when she gets into her car
after work,

10:08.100 --> 10:12.200
she's got a poo puddle
waiting for her.

10:14.567 --> 10:16.100
- That's insane, Bill.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.100
- I've got a poo disc
in the freezer, if you want it?

10:19.200 --> 10:21.167
- Oh, my gosh,
I thought that was

10:21.267 --> 10:22.900
a Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage.
- Nope.

10:29.867 --> 10:31.633
- Superglue for a super bitch.

10:39.433 --> 10:40.400
What up?

10:40.500 --> 10:41.833
- Jillian says she needs you

10:41.933 --> 10:44.233
to come tuck her napkin
into her shirt.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.033
- Of course, yes.

10:46.133 --> 10:48.333
She asked me to tidy up as well,
which I'm doing,

10:48.433 --> 10:51.633
and, also, I'm making
a personal call to my father.

10:52.700 --> 10:54.567
- Okay.

10:54.667 --> 10:56.867
- Okay, bye.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.267
Oh, shoot.

11:01.767 --> 11:03.467
Ah!

11:03.567 --> 11:05.467
Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:05.567 --> 11:07.967
- Hey, buddy.
A little medium raw, please.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.933
- Loin is for closers only.

11:10.067 --> 11:12.100
- It is.
Loin's for closers.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.267
There you go.
Enjoy the loin.

11:14.367 --> 11:15.500
Sorry, honey.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.100
- Come on, man.
They've all eaten.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.900
There's, like, a ton
of leftover loin.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.967
- Mm, in fact, there's
no leftover loin. Ders...

11:22.067 --> 11:23.667
[whispering]
Know your place.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.600
- Have you forgotten
what's it's like to make a sale?

11:25.700 --> 11:28.467
- I don't remember anything
before putting on this apron

11:28.567 --> 11:31.300
and getting the attention
of a lifetime.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.800
- Good luck with that.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.200
Wow.
- Bye!

11:37.333 --> 11:39.467
- [sighs]

11:39.567 --> 11:42.700
It's good to be back.

11:42.800 --> 11:44.067
Hello, ma'am?

11:44.100 --> 11:45.733
Hi. Uh, my name's
Anders Holmvik,

11:45.833 --> 11:48.067
and I'm calling to talk to you
about your blobs. I--

11:48.100 --> 11:51.967
Sorry. I'm calling to talk
to you about your knock-wobbles.

11:52.067 --> 11:53.967
Sorry.
I'm calling to talk to you

11:54.067 --> 11:55.067
about your chest bombs, ma'am,

11:55.133 --> 11:56.533
I mean--

11:56.633 --> 11:58.533
I'm just calling to talk to you
about your tits.

11:58.633 --> 11:59.733
[dial tone]

11:59.833 --> 12:00.867
Hello?

12:00.967 --> 12:03.133
You stupid, dumb dick.

12:03.233 --> 12:05.067
Aah!

12:10.700 --> 12:13.600
Wait a second.

12:13.700 --> 12:16.067
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

12:16.133 --> 12:18.467
[bottle spraying]
Just--

12:18.567 --> 12:21.767
[inhales sharply]
You can do this.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.200
It's not bad, actually.

12:24.300 --> 12:25.433
* *

12:25.533 --> 12:29.467
- * He's insane

12:29.567 --> 12:31.933
*

12:33.500 --> 12:36.733
- Hey, gals,
got a tasty bit of trivia.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.567
It turns out
that, uh, Jillian here

12:38.667 --> 12:41.867
has quite
the embarrassing tattoo.

12:41.967 --> 12:44.567
- No, I--no, I don't.
- Yes.

12:44.667 --> 12:45.967
- You have a real tattoo?

12:46.067 --> 12:48.233
- You guys want--
you want to see it?

12:48.333 --> 12:49.600
- Yes.
- Yeah!

12:49.700 --> 12:51.233
- All right, fine.
I'll show you. Fine.

12:51.333 --> 12:52.867
I'll show it to you too,
Blake...

12:52.967 --> 12:54.100
- Oh, good.
- Since you're so interested.

12:54.200 --> 12:55.367
Ladies...

12:55.467 --> 12:57.267
can you unzip?

12:57.367 --> 12:58.767
- This ought to be
real good.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.667
Whoa.
- Whoa!

13:00.767 --> 13:03.267
- It's big.
- Jillian, that is badass.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.767
I had no idea.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.700
- No, it's not badass.
It's embarrassing.

13:06.800 --> 13:08.967
I wanted the same tat
as my granddaddy,

13:09.067 --> 13:11.633
and I took the photo in
to show the tattoo artist,

13:11.733 --> 13:14.767
and he just--he messed up,
and he tattooed the whole photo.

13:14.867 --> 13:19.067
- Polaroids are a throwback,
and that means that is dope.

13:19.167 --> 13:20.833
- Girl, you got
a throwback back.

13:20.933 --> 13:23.333
- You really think so?
both: Yeah.

13:23.433 --> 13:25.100
- You guys are dope.
- You are.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.100
- You're dope.
[laughter]

13:27.200 --> 13:29.367
- Could you zip me up?

13:29.467 --> 13:30.733
Thanks, sisters.

13:30.833 --> 13:33.767
Sister!
[laughter]

13:36.067 --> 13:38.600
Did you come at me?

13:38.700 --> 13:40.667
I will fudging end you.

13:40.767 --> 13:44.667
I will rip off your head
and fudge it down your neck.

13:44.767 --> 13:48.100
- Okay, all right, all right.
All right, sorry.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.400
[laughter]

13:50.500 --> 13:53.333
[phone dialing]

13:53.433 --> 13:55.733
[line trilling]

13:55.833 --> 13:57.333
- [exhales deeply]

13:57.433 --> 13:59.700
Hello, hi, uh, yes, uh,
Mrs. Wilson?

13:59.800 --> 14:01.633
How are you?

14:01.733 --> 14:04.600
My name's Anders Holmvik,
and I'm calling to tell you how

14:04.700 --> 14:06.167
how the Boobillow
breast pillow rest

14:06.267 --> 14:08.467
is going to change your life.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.267
I made a sale.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.233
Phyllis Wilson--34F.

14:13.333 --> 14:17.367
But I neutralized my sexuality,
so I don't care.

14:17.467 --> 14:18.700
- Is this true, Jillian?

14:18.800 --> 14:21.233
- Um, Phyllis Wilson,
you said?

14:21.333 --> 14:24.067
Um, no, I made that sale
this morning.

14:24.167 --> 14:25.733
He's a liar.
- No, I'm not.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.667
I'm not lying, okay?
I have nothing to lie about.

14:28.767 --> 14:31.333
- Yeah, I, like, almost cared
for two seconds.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.867
- [chuckles] Right?
- No, no.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.700
But I sprayed the stuff,
so I can't feel a thing.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.333
- Did you feel that?

14:36.433 --> 14:39.467
- No.
Not down there.

14:39.567 --> 14:41.067
But, yeah.

14:41.133 --> 14:42.667
Yeah, up here.

14:42.767 --> 14:45.633
- One! Two!

14:45.733 --> 14:48.867
all: Three! Four! Five!
- Aah!

14:48.967 --> 14:51.233
Oh! Aah!

14:51.333 --> 14:54.067
[chuckles]
I cramped up there.

14:54.133 --> 14:55.867
- Very good, Adam.

14:55.967 --> 14:58.067
That's very strong.
- Very strong. Thank you.

14:58.167 --> 14:59.633
- All right,
listen up, everybody.

14:59.733 --> 15:03.067
Sales of the Boobillow
have been so amazing

15:03.167 --> 15:06.433
that I just signed a contract
with FemCo

15:06.533 --> 15:09.533
to sell their products
exclusively.

15:09.633 --> 15:13.833
Which means these kick-ass
office changes are permanent!

15:13.933 --> 15:16.067
[women cheering]
- Oh, my God!

15:16.133 --> 15:18.700
Oh, my God!

15:18.800 --> 15:20.833
- Hey, psst.
- Jesus.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.500
- Come on in here.

15:22.600 --> 15:24.867
Go. He's coming. He's coming.
- I know. Okay.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.533
- These women
have to be stopped, all right?

15:26.633 --> 15:28.067
I can't take this anymore.
- It's true, man.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.833
Jillian is a monster.

15:29.933 --> 15:32.800
Mere seconds ago, she told me
she wanted to butt-fudge me

15:32.900 --> 15:34.467
in the mouth or something.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.600
I don't know.
- Ow! Ow, my eyes! They hurt!

15:37.700 --> 15:40.767
They hurt from how ugly you are
when you complain.

15:40.867 --> 15:44.467
This is, like, an amazing time
to be a man.

15:44.567 --> 15:46.800
Finally we get "oogled"
and ogled

15:46.900 --> 15:49.200
and--and get sexualized.

15:49.300 --> 15:51.200
- I mean,
he did always love that.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.967
- Yeah, but he also
loved sales.

15:53.067 --> 15:55.533
- Guys, women rule the world,

15:55.633 --> 15:58.067
and it's time
that we accept that.

15:58.133 --> 16:00.167
Let's be on the right side
of histor-she.

16:00.267 --> 16:01.667
- No.
- What did you just say?

16:01.767 --> 16:03.900
- Histor-she.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.233
That is not the word.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.700
It is his-story.
- Adam...

16:06.800 --> 16:08.667
- [grunts]
Miss Murphy, I got you

16:08.767 --> 16:11.067
a warm, steaming travel mug

16:11.100 --> 16:13.933
of Darjeeling Limited
Edition Tazo tea.

16:14.067 --> 16:16.500
- Yeah, you can just
put that down anywhere, Adam.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.133
[tray clatters]

16:18.233 --> 16:20.133
- What's going on here?
Is he assaulting you?

16:20.233 --> 16:22.733
Do I need to frickin' throw down
right now?

16:22.833 --> 16:24.167
Is that what I need to do?

16:24.267 --> 16:25.900
- Okay, cut it out, Adam.

16:26.067 --> 16:27.267
Gil is my new assistant.

16:27.367 --> 16:31.167
- [laughing]

16:31.267 --> 16:32.633
[stammering]

16:32.733 --> 16:35.167
What kind of massaging
are you even doing, Gil?

16:35.267 --> 16:37.433
You don't even know massaging.
What kind of massaging is that?

16:37.533 --> 16:39.067
- Foot.

16:39.100 --> 16:40.933
- That makes sense.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.733
I thought
I was your number one.

16:42.833 --> 16:45.933
- Yeah, well, right now
you're acting like a number two.

16:46.067 --> 16:48.133
[soothing traditional
Asian music playing]

16:48.233 --> 16:49.967
- Was that a poop joke?

16:50.067 --> 16:52.467
[dramatic music]
- Yep.

16:59.100 --> 17:02.333
[ice clacking]

17:04.133 --> 17:06.200
- I got to say something.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.400
Yeah, yeah.
- No, do it.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.800
- [clears throat]
Ahem! Ahem!

17:09.900 --> 17:12.567
I wanted to just say something
to the women of this office,

17:12.667 --> 17:16.267
and that is that I think
things need to change,

17:16.367 --> 17:18.267
if that's okay.

17:18.367 --> 17:20.800
[laughter]
- No, no, no, he's right.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.633
Because the way you are
treating us is like used meat,

17:23.733 --> 17:24.800
and we're not meat.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.933
We're men...
with feelings.

17:27.067 --> 17:28.300
Treat us thusly.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.467
- Whoops.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.067
Oh, I dropped my popcorn.

17:33.133 --> 17:35.300
I guess you guys are gonna
have to come pick it up.

17:35.400 --> 17:37.267
- Yeah, whoo!
- Pick it all up.

17:37.367 --> 17:39.967
[laughter and cat-calling]

17:40.067 --> 17:41.900
- It's not gonna do it itself.

17:42.067 --> 17:43.367
Oh, missed a spot.

17:43.467 --> 17:44.933
- We haven't even started,
Jillian.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.067
- Oh, hey,
would it be easier

17:47.167 --> 17:49.967
if you took your tops off?

17:50.067 --> 17:51.800
[women cheer]

17:51.900 --> 17:53.933

Unbutton your buttons!

Unbutton your buttons!
Unbutton your buttons!

18:00.067 --> 18:02.333
Unbutton your buttons!
Unbutton your buttons!

18:02.433 --> 18:04.667
- Stand up!
Cover yourselves!

18:07.700 --> 18:10.100
What is wrong
with you women?

18:10.200 --> 18:15.067
For days, we've been held down
by the matriarchy...

18:15.167 --> 18:16.700
which is a word
I recently looked up,

18:16.800 --> 18:19.233
and it means
when women control things.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.767
We are not gonna stand by

18:21.867 --> 18:24.833
and be harassed
and controlled by you...

18:24.933 --> 18:29.067
'cause men are invaluable,

18:29.100 --> 18:31.533
and we should be treated
as such.

- No! No! That wasn't--
I'm not a piece of meat!

18:38.267 --> 18:42.067
I'm not a piece of meat!

18:42.100 --> 18:44.200
Just as women...

18:44.300 --> 18:47.500
burned bras
in the '70s to be hot,

18:47.600 --> 18:51.567
I shall burn this Boobillow
for men's rights!

18:51.667 --> 18:54.500
To infinity and beyond!

18:54.600 --> 18:57.067
Men rule. Men--
- Whoa!

18:57.100 --> 19:00.067
[all shouting]

19:02.267 --> 19:04.233
- Fire!
- Fire!

19:04.333 --> 19:07.067
- Fire! Watch it!

19:07.100 --> 19:09.300
- [screaming]

19:09.400 --> 19:11.267
- Where's Sigourney?

19:11.367 --> 19:13.467
- Oh, she's still in there!
Oh, my God, where's Sigourney?

19:13.567 --> 19:15.133
- All right, women,
shut up and stand back.

19:15.233 --> 19:17.467
Heroism is man business.

19:17.567 --> 19:20.400
- That's right--
shut up and stand--stand back

19:20.500 --> 19:22.767
and--and grab on
to your tampon string.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.300
- Yeah, everybody shut up,

19:24.400 --> 19:25.900
'cause the men are about
to s-save the day.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.800
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Save the day.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.833
- That's what we're gonna do.
- All right, save the day!

19:29.933 --> 19:31.467
- Men doing men stuff!
- We got this.

19:31.567 --> 19:33.467
- All right.
- Whoa!

19:33.567 --> 19:34.633
[fire alarm bell ringing]

19:34.733 --> 19:36.467
- Be careful.

19:36.567 --> 19:40.833
- Everyone's out.
Everyone's safe.

19:40.933 --> 19:42.433
- Guys?
- Sigourney?

19:42.533 --> 19:44.300
- Help!

19:44.400 --> 19:51.067
*

19:51.100 --> 19:52.333
- Oh, thank God.

19:52.433 --> 19:54.467
- My beautiful boys
are in there! Save them!

19:54.567 --> 19:58.567
- [screams, shuddering]

19:58.667 --> 20:02.000
[suspenseful music]

20:02.100 --> 20:04.900
[Ders and Adam coughing]

20:05.000 --> 20:07.333
- Are you okay?
Are you okay?

20:07.433 --> 20:09.833
- We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

20:09.933 --> 20:11.233
- [coughs]
I'm good.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.733
- You want to know
why we're okay?

20:12.833 --> 20:15.633
Because we were saved
by some guys.

20:15.733 --> 20:18.433
- Yeah, some
real manly male fire-men.

20:18.533 --> 20:20.000
- That's right.
- That is right.

20:20.100 --> 20:21.400
Yeah.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.133
- No, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

20:24.233 --> 20:26.467
- Oh, yes!

20:26.567 --> 20:28.467
- Yes!
- Dudes!

20:28.567 --> 20:30.233
- That's what
I'm talking about.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.100
Thanks, man.
Good stuff, good stuff.

20:33.200 --> 20:37.433
- Well, everyone, I would love
to be able to fire Adam

20:37.533 --> 20:39.167
for setting the office on fire,

20:39.267 --> 20:42.800
but, unfortunately, FemCo
is taking full responsibility,

20:42.900 --> 20:45.300
because the Boobillows
were so highly flammable.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.700
- Whoo!

20:46.800 --> 20:48.733
- Everyone will resume
their normal jobs.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.067
Thanks, [bleep]-tard.

20:50.167 --> 20:51.667
- You're welcome.
I'm here to help.

20:51.767 --> 20:54.667
- Whoa, heads up.
Coffee's for closers.

20:54.767 --> 20:56.867
- Actually, I quit coffee.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.400
I mean, sure, the caffeine
turned me into a sales beast

20:59.500 --> 21:01.767
that made me enough money
to fix my back tat, but--

21:01.867 --> 21:03.767
I sure will miss
that cubicle, though.

21:03.867 --> 21:06.800
[chuckles]
- Yeah.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.600
[boing]

21:08.700 --> 21:10.633
- Nice.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.833
- [sobbing, shuddering]

21:21.667 --> 21:23.767
[man snickers]

21:23.867 --> 21:26.800
[stifled laughter]
