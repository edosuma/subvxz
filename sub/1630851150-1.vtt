00:55.597 --> 00:59.309
From the beginning of civilization,
we've known there's something captivating

00:59.393 --> 01:01.979
about watching human beings fight
for their lives.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.899
That's why we watch gladiator games,
public executions.

01:06.525 --> 01:10.487
We created a sport for people
who still have a thirst for savagery.

01:10.571 --> 01:11.905
What did you just do?

01:11.989 --> 01:15.242
Our customers are some
of the most powerful people in the world.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.743
Real fun game, huh?

01:16.827 --> 01:19.121
Every year they demand more.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.748
More complicated rooms,

01:21.832 --> 01:24.418
more ways to gamble on life and death.

01:24.501 --> 01:29.131
And we provided them
with a box seat for life's ultimate drama.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.677
"This serves as an entry voucher..."

01:33.760 --> 01:35.429
"...for Minos Escape Rooms."

01:35.512 --> 01:37.472
Are there rules and regulations, or what?

01:37.556 --> 01:39.600
You have to escape
before the clock runs out.

01:39.683 --> 01:42.352
Anything that looks
like a puzzle or a code.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.564
Numbers are very important.
It could be anything, anywhere.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.236
Zoey, you go first.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.572
They're watching.
They know every move we're making.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.782
They knew everything about us.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.660
Zoey! Goddamn it. Zoey!

02:00.954 --> 02:03.332
She sacrificed herself for us!

02:04.208 --> 02:06.585
You're the psycho that designed
this murder maze, huh?

02:06.668 --> 02:09.588
No, I'm the Games Master.
The Puzzle Maker designs the rooms.

02:09.670 --> 02:10.881
Ben.

02:13.759 --> 02:15.511
You came back for me.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.804
Yeah. Well, I'm tired
of being the only survivor.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.890
I am not imagining this.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.266
You gotta let this shit go.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.560
Everyone else who was sent
those invitations died,

02:23.644 --> 02:26.355
and whoever sent them is still out there.

02:26.438 --> 02:29.608
The logo. They're coordinates
in the middle of Manhattan.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.235
Are you in?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.569
Yeah, I'm in.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.436
Go and wash up. It's late.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.729
You must be tired.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.608
Okay. Can I say hi to Dad?
I wanna tell him about our day--

03:11.692 --> 03:13.360
No. You know he's busy working.

03:15.237 --> 03:16.113
Okay.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.206
I had a lot of fun today, Mom.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.241
Not now.

04:01.325 --> 04:02.534
We need to talk.

04:02.618 --> 04:03.952
I am on a deadline,

04:04.036 --> 04:07.497
and you know what happens if I miss it.

04:07.581 --> 04:11.335
We're not doing Claire any favors
by pretending nothing is wrong here.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.296
I've made up my mind.

04:14.838 --> 04:17.257
I can't do this anymore.

04:22.888 --> 04:25.098
You wanna take her away from me?

04:26.725 --> 04:29.186
You wanna break up this family.

04:31.063 --> 04:35.359
This family is already broken.

04:38.445 --> 04:43.283
I don't have time for this.
I am already behind.

04:46.078 --> 04:49.998
We can talk about this
in an hour when I'm finished.

04:50.082 --> 04:52.709
-I'm not gonna change my mind.
-One hour!

04:55.170 --> 04:57.840
Please. Just give me
the chance to talk this through.

04:57.923 --> 05:01.593
You can take the time, have a swim,
clear your head and then...

05:04.346 --> 05:07.850
I won't argue, I promise.
I'll just listen.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.604
One hour.

08:26.048 --> 08:26.882
Henry?

08:27.758 --> 08:28.592
Henry!

08:32.929 --> 08:37.601
I'm not playing this game.
Please, honey, you don't have to do this.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.395
I'm sorry for what I said. Please. God.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.524
No! No! Damn it, don't!

08:51.114 --> 08:52.658
Okay. Okay.

08:53.909 --> 08:56.954
"I grow in earth. I shrink in wind.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.082
I drown in water. I survive in fire.
What am I?"

09:00.874 --> 09:02.334
I can't believe this is happening.

09:03.043 --> 09:06.004
Okay, think. Think! "Grow in earth."

09:07.464 --> 09:10.092
"Shrink in wind. Survive in fire."

09:10.843 --> 09:12.511
It's a rock. Rock.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.558
Okay. What is it? What is it? Okay.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.393
What am I looking for?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.310
Come on.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.730
Come on!

09:24.356 --> 09:26.066
It's a different color. It has to be.

09:27.776 --> 09:28.610
This one.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.031
Okay.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.661
What is it? What is it?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.168
What does it do?

09:45.502 --> 09:47.629
It's a magnet. Okay.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.214
No! Come on!

09:52.718 --> 09:53.552
Metal.

10:00.309 --> 10:02.060
Okay. Come on.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.744
Good.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.207
Brace yourself!

11:07.459 --> 11:08.627
Ending sim.

11:09.628 --> 11:10.629
You wanna reset?

11:11.630 --> 11:13.966
No. Good work.
We're ready for game time.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.600
-What's the probability of survival?
-It's approximately 4%.

11:23.684 --> 11:27.938
I'm so glad
Zoey got over her fear of flying.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.120
It's not too late. You know?

11:44.788 --> 11:45.914
Too late for what?

11:48.500 --> 11:51.879
To get out of here, I guess.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.507
What do you mean?

11:56.884 --> 11:58.927
We could walk away if we wanted to.

11:59.511 --> 12:01.180
We're literally at the gate, Ben.

12:01.263 --> 12:04.099
We could just go grab a slice.
You know, catch a game.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.350
"Catch a game"?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.728
I don't know. I'm just saying...

12:09.188 --> 12:11.315
we don't have to do this.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.818
-You're having second thoughts?
-No, no, I'm sticking by your side.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.321
Look, we were lucky
to get out of those games alive.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.865
I just think that it's okay,
that we can...

12:21.200 --> 12:22.284
keep on living.

12:22.367 --> 12:23.785
I have to do this.

12:24.995 --> 12:26.705
Minos is still killing people.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.460
You don't have to come.

12:32.669 --> 12:34.046
No, here we go.

12:35.214 --> 12:38.717
Flying heroically into danger.

12:38.800 --> 12:43.472
Or flying, you know,
discount economy into danger.

12:55.651 --> 12:57.569
Ensler. How is she today?

12:59.321 --> 13:00.322
She seems focused.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.366
Like always, sir.

13:20.926 --> 13:22.594
One second, I'm almost done.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.055
I did a good job. Don't worry.

13:25.138 --> 13:27.724
Yes, I know, Claire,
you do wonderful work.

13:30.102 --> 13:33.230
I need you to understand
how high the stakes are this time.

13:34.523 --> 13:35.691
What's it matter?

13:40.279 --> 13:43.198
Either way,
I'll still be locked in a cage.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.748
How long do you think
you'd last down here...

13:52.916 --> 13:54.251
if anything happened to me?

13:54.334 --> 13:57.796
Maybe you should've built
these rooms yourself, then,

13:57.880 --> 14:00.048
instead of obsessing
over a way to kill Zoey.

14:02.843 --> 14:04.261
She's not ready.

14:05.762 --> 14:09.433
She thinks that she can expose us.

14:10.309 --> 14:11.894
Chrissake.

14:11.977 --> 14:14.521
Maybe I just understand her
a little bit better than you do.

14:14.605 --> 14:16.773
I mean, we both know
what it's like to lose our mom.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.127
Thanks, sir.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.421
-Hi. There we go. Thank you.
-Thank you.

14:39.505 --> 14:40.881
Next passenger.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.218
Next passenger.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.220
Next.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.269
Your ticket, ma'am.

14:56.396 --> 14:57.439
Ma'am?

15:01.151 --> 15:02.736
Have a nice flight.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.122
Zoey. Hey.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.958
Zoey, are you all right?

15:19.169 --> 15:20.170
Zoey.

15:20.879 --> 15:22.005
Zoey, honey.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.007
Zoey! Are you okay?

15:25.551 --> 15:26.552
Honey.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.596
-Are you excited for Vietnam?
-Mom?

15:31.348 --> 15:33.100
I don't think I can do this.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.936
-I can't do this.
-Yeah, okay. So let's go.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.813
-No.
-Hey, Zoey!

15:37.896 --> 15:40.524
Stop. Hey, stop.

15:45.487 --> 15:48.365
They said we could only afford
the shittiest car they had, but...

15:49.408 --> 15:53.245
I managed to boost us up to a four-door
with a broken windshield wiper.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.665
As long as we sign the release.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.959
How are you still willing to come with me?

15:59.793 --> 16:04.506
I mean, I wanna stop Minos and everything,
but I can't even get on the plane.

16:06.884 --> 16:07.843
Look...

16:12.472 --> 16:14.558
I didn't wanna tell you this, but...

16:16.935 --> 16:18.687
I got fired from my job.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.859
I had a panic attack in front of a client,
we were...

16:25.485 --> 16:28.280
walking out of a door, it got stuck,

16:28.363 --> 16:30.324
and I broke down.

16:34.077 --> 16:37.581
So you're not alone in feeling this way.
Okay?

16:41.668 --> 16:46.465
Plus, I tend to have this weird
loyalty thing for people who save my life.

16:48.967 --> 16:49.801
Thanks.

16:52.221 --> 16:55.724
Don't thank me too much. You're the one
that's gotta drive the whole way.

16:59.686 --> 17:00.771
Let's do it, yeah?

17:01.605 --> 17:03.815
Sure you don't wanna stop in Cleveland?

17:03.899 --> 17:06.026
Ben, I said no detours.

17:07.069 --> 17:10.948
I know this is a lot to ask,
so thank you for coming with me.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.701
Well, don't thank me too much.

17:15.536 --> 17:17.162
I don't have any gas money.

17:18.288 --> 17:20.499
Actually don't have any money.

17:21.625 --> 17:25.462
No. I'm not spending the next two days
in a car full of smoke with you.

17:32.010 --> 17:33.303
Should we go to bed?

17:34.346 --> 17:36.306
-Are you tired?
-No.

17:36.390 --> 17:37.474
But...

17:38.600 --> 17:40.143
we should try, right?

17:42.062 --> 17:43.146
Yeah.

17:48.277 --> 17:51.238
-Go ahead. No, you go.
-You go. You stood up first.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.282
No, no, no. You go. No, go.

17:53.365 --> 17:54.700
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

18:00.539 --> 18:01.999
Smooth move, man.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.021
Okay.

18:27.065 --> 18:30.444
Ben? Ben, it's locked! I can't get out!

18:30.527 --> 18:32.863
-Zoey? Zoey!
-Ben! Ben! I can't get out!

18:32.946 --> 18:34.573
Come on! We gotta go!

18:35.282 --> 18:36.116
Zoey!

18:38.619 --> 18:40.412
No, no, no. No!

18:40.996 --> 18:41.914
Shit!

18:44.416 --> 18:45.959
No, no, no! No!

18:48.921 --> 18:50.214
Oh, shit!

18:53.842 --> 18:54.843
No, no, no!

19:00.474 --> 19:02.142
No! No, no, no!

19:06.313 --> 19:07.940
Shit. Oh, shit.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.319
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong? What's wrong?

19:12.402 --> 19:14.112
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

19:14.655 --> 19:15.781
Oh, shit.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.786
Hey, I think you just had a nightmare.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.663
I saw-- I saw the--

19:23.372 --> 19:24.915
The whole thing was just--

19:25.541 --> 19:26.500
Just a dream.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.127
Yeah. It was just--

19:29.711 --> 19:31.588
-We gotta get these guys.
-Yeah.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.174
-Let's get out of here.
-Yeah.

19:35.843 --> 19:37.386
We're almost there.

19:37.469 --> 19:39.263
It's an abandoned government building.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.056
There's no record, there's no deed.

19:41.139 --> 19:42.724
It's a total black hole.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.981
This is it. We're here.

19:54.695 --> 19:56.613
Looks like Minos went out of business.

19:58.323 --> 20:00.534
Are we sure we got the coordinates right?

20:00.617 --> 20:02.494
This doesn't make any sense.

20:06.331 --> 20:10.460
Look. This was from two days ago.
It's filled with workers.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.504
This has to be the right place.

20:17.885 --> 20:22.472
Can we just circle the perimeter
before we enter this hell-trap nightmare?

20:22.556 --> 20:24.516
-You stay out here.
-That's not what I meant.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.101
Hey, just stop.

20:27.978 --> 20:29.438
Wait, no. Zoey.

20:33.734 --> 20:37.237
Can we just look at the coordinates again?
Maybe we got a number wrong.

20:37.946 --> 20:38.780
Come on. I--

20:41.325 --> 20:42.951
We shouldn't be in here.

20:43.035 --> 20:46.246
We need answers. We came this far,
we have to figure this out.

20:46.330 --> 20:47.706
It's all locked. There's no use.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.166
-No!
-There's nothing in there.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.420
Let's just retrace the steps.

20:53.504 --> 20:55.672
-There has to be something in here.
-Hey!

20:56.673 --> 20:57.758
What's up, guys?

20:57.841 --> 21:01.929
You guys shouldn't be here.
It's not safe. This place is condemned.

21:02.012 --> 21:03.514
Yeah, I think...

21:03.597 --> 21:05.974
I mean, I can help you get in there.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.270
I haven't eaten
in a couple of days though.

21:10.354 --> 21:14.691
-Can you maybe help me out?
-Look, I don't-- Hey!

21:14.775 --> 21:16.818
-Hey!
-What the hell? Come on, stop!

21:16.902 --> 21:19.071
-Come back!
-Come on, get back here!

21:20.739 --> 21:21.573
Stop!

21:26.870 --> 21:28.830
Stop him! Come on!

21:28.914 --> 21:29.998
Hey!

21:31.208 --> 21:33.043
-Hey!
-Stop!

21:34.336 --> 21:35.170
Watch it!

21:35.796 --> 21:37.172
Slow down!

21:40.509 --> 21:41.426
Out of the way!

21:45.013 --> 21:45.973
Hey!

21:46.515 --> 21:48.183
Somebody stop him!

21:50.686 --> 21:52.396
-Ben!
-Zoey, come on!

21:53.689 --> 21:55.023
Assholes.

21:55.691 --> 21:57.943
Hey! Get back here, man!

22:03.073 --> 22:04.449
-Hey!
-Get him! Get him!

22:08.537 --> 22:10.122
No, no, no. No.

22:11.790 --> 22:12.875
Oh, shit.

22:13.834 --> 22:17.421
Okay, look,
we'll find a cop at the next station.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.965
Maybe there's some surveillance footage
or something.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.634
No, there's no point. It's gone.

22:24.553 --> 22:25.721
That was my mom's.

22:29.725 --> 22:30.726
I'm sorry.

22:32.728 --> 22:37.482
Look, we should get off at the next stop
and go back to the building.

22:37.566 --> 22:39.860
-Yeah.
-There's something there, I know it.

22:39.943 --> 22:42.654
Yeah. We're gonna find our own way in.

22:43.322 --> 22:44.239
No matter what.

22:45.866 --> 22:48.744
Just, new rule,
no more talking to junkies.

22:49.912 --> 22:53.248
Hey, baby. You're not gonna believe
where I am right now.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.876
No, I am on the train.

22:55.959 --> 22:58.754
I couldn't get the damn thing
to start this morning.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.214
Had to leave the car at the gym.

23:01.215 --> 23:03.842
Yeah, I know.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

23:05.302 --> 23:08.722
Because! Listen, when I make my baby
a promise, I keep it.

23:09.848 --> 23:10.682
Okay.

23:11.475 --> 23:15.229
Hey, that was one time.
Your mother doesn't like...

23:15.312 --> 23:16.313
Do you hear that?

23:18.065 --> 23:19.233
Train noises.

23:26.073 --> 23:27.241
Yeah, I hear that.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.335
What's going on?

23:39.294 --> 23:41.129
Isn't the conductor supposed
to be in here?

23:41.213 --> 23:42.881
Yeah. I don't know.

23:56.895 --> 23:58.272
-Hey.
-What just happened?

23:59.773 --> 24:02.150
That's bad, right? Holy shit.

24:02.234 --> 24:03.944
Hey, baby, I'll call you back, okay?

24:04.027 --> 24:07.364
-What the hell is going on?
-I don't know. The train just uncoupled!

24:07.447 --> 24:09.908
-What do you mean, uncoupled?
-They separated!

24:09.992 --> 24:11.869
-What do I do?
-I don't know!

24:11.952 --> 24:14.872
-Hit the button!
-I have hit the button!

24:17.916 --> 24:19.001
-Hey!
-Hey!

24:26.508 --> 24:28.719
Hey! Hold on to something!

24:31.388 --> 24:33.056
-Stop touching shit!
-Do something!

24:37.811 --> 24:40.898
Shit! Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

24:40.981 --> 24:41.940
Baby?

24:44.067 --> 24:45.736
Tiff, can you hear me?

24:45.819 --> 24:47.237
Oh, shit.

24:49.114 --> 24:50.574
Is that the end of the track?

24:50.657 --> 24:51.909
Oh, no, no, no!

24:57.289 --> 24:59.124
-Run! Run!
-Go, go, go!

25:12.471 --> 25:14.348
Hey. Hey!

25:15.182 --> 25:17.059
Hey. Let me see.

25:17.601 --> 25:19.520
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, you?

25:20.270 --> 25:21.563
Okay, you're not bleeding.

25:21.647 --> 25:22.773
Where are we?

25:24.066 --> 25:24.983
My head.

25:40.666 --> 25:43.210
-Okay.
-Come on. Get up, you got this.

25:43.293 --> 25:44.670
Come on, come on.

25:44.753 --> 25:45.838
Is everyone okay?

25:47.381 --> 25:48.674
Hey, man, you're leaking.

25:50.384 --> 25:54.179
-Don't you think it's early for that?
-This day just gets better and better.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.308
How long you think
till someone comes for us?

25:58.392 --> 26:01.687
I don't know. It's like 100 miles
of derelict track down here.

26:02.980 --> 26:06.900
And no one knows where the hell we are,
so I'd say long as hell.

26:06.984 --> 26:07.985
Great.

26:09.236 --> 26:10.571
I'm not getting a signal.

26:10.654 --> 26:12.739
Let me know when the cavalry arrives.

26:12.823 --> 26:13.824
Hold on a second.

26:14.491 --> 26:16.326
Looks like we're in an abandoned station.

26:16.410 --> 26:17.786
You're shitting, right?

26:20.455 --> 26:21.373
Hey!

26:23.959 --> 26:25.085
Hello?

26:26.461 --> 26:29.506
Hey, you got six people trapped in here.
Somebody sending help?

26:30.340 --> 26:32.301
Attention, passengers.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.345
Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.

26:35.429 --> 26:39.892
If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.

26:40.517 --> 26:42.686
Remain alert and good luck.

26:45.939 --> 26:47.399
Minos found us.

26:49.985 --> 26:51.695
Did you just say "Minos"?

26:51.778 --> 26:53.697
It's happening again.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.783
No. No.

26:57.534 --> 27:00.537
No. No, no, no.

27:00.621 --> 27:03.790
No, I knew I shouldn't have
come back. Oh, my God.

27:03.874 --> 27:06.418
Wait. What, you guys have played
the game before?

27:06.502 --> 27:10.714
How do you think I got this, huh?
They locked me in a goddamn submarine.

27:12.216 --> 27:14.760
Then they increased the air pressure
until my eardrums burst.

27:15.761 --> 27:17.179
So that makes this what?

27:18.472 --> 27:19.890
Tournament of champions?

27:21.058 --> 27:23.018
No. No!

27:23.101 --> 27:25.395
No! No!

27:26.271 --> 27:28.524
Let me out!

27:28.607 --> 27:32.110
I'm not playing this game again,
you no-good pieces of shit!

27:32.194 --> 27:34.404
Hey, hey, hey! You're making it worse!

27:34.488 --> 27:36.698
Don't make it worse, okay?
Don't make it worse.

27:38.534 --> 27:42.204
If they can hijack a train,
they can reinforce the doors, okay?

27:42.287 --> 27:44.081
It's my wife's birthday today.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.252
I told her I wouldn't be late.

27:51.547 --> 27:53.215
I'm always late.

27:59.680 --> 28:03.141
I should've done more.
I should've convinced you not to come.

28:03.225 --> 28:04.977
Ben, Ben, Ben. Look at me.

28:05.060 --> 28:08.647
Look, we broke out once.
We'll do it again. I promise, okay?

28:09.773 --> 28:12.317
You gotta get
that fantasy out of your head.

28:12.401 --> 28:15.737
Okay, we've all been through this before.
We solve the puzzles, we win.

28:15.821 --> 28:18.824
-We go free.
-You mean, one of us does.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.288
What's that sound?

28:38.719 --> 28:39.928
What the hell is that?

29:12.419 --> 29:15.297
-No.
-I don't like the sound of that.

29:32.231 --> 29:34.107
Shit! Shit, I just got shocked.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.151
-You all right?
-Yeah.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.111
They electrified the entire car?

29:38.195 --> 29:41.156
We all know how this works.
We play the game or we die.

29:41.240 --> 29:45.160
This is exactly what they want us to do,
dance for their amusement.

29:45.244 --> 29:48.330
I don't know about you,
but I'm not dying on nobody's Q Train.

29:52.125 --> 29:53.544
Attention, passengers.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.214
Keep your belongings
in sight at all times.

29:57.297 --> 30:01.844
If you see a suspicious package,
please tell the nearest MTA employee.

30:01.927 --> 30:04.388
Remain alert and good luck.

30:04.471 --> 30:07.432
Hey, I found a bag.
This belong to any of you?

30:08.183 --> 30:09.101
What's in it?

30:13.146 --> 30:14.189
There's a towel...

30:14.731 --> 30:16.859
-Oh, shit.
-Hey, careful, bro.

30:19.862 --> 30:23.031
Okay. Let's find out
what that handle goes to.

30:23.115 --> 30:24.283
Everyone split up.

30:24.950 --> 30:27.494
-All right. Careful about the poles.
-Seriously, homeys.

30:27.578 --> 30:29.413
It's gotta be to one of the doors.

30:30.414 --> 30:32.541
The handle's metal
so we need to be careful.

30:46.138 --> 30:48.765
-I think I found the way out.
-Does it need the handle?

30:48.849 --> 30:51.643
No. It's a trapdoor.
There's gotta be another way to open it.

30:51.727 --> 30:54.730
Jesus Christ. Come on, guys.
You aren't listening to the whole clue.

30:54.813 --> 30:58.817
They said report any of this shit
to the MTA employee, right? Right?

30:58.901 --> 31:00.319
That's the conductor booth.

31:00.402 --> 31:02.905
-Just give me the damn thing.
-Will you be careful?

31:02.988 --> 31:05.365
Yeah. We don't have a choice, all right?

31:06.366 --> 31:07.576
Shit!

31:11.163 --> 31:13.498
Hope you enjoyed that, assholes.

31:14.917 --> 31:15.959
Wait a minute.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.505
-Leather's an insulator.
-Yeah, yeah, that's smart.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.217
Okay.

31:28.555 --> 31:29.556
Hey, it worked!

31:40.692 --> 31:41.568
Shit!

31:41.652 --> 31:43.070
-You okay?
-Yeah.

31:43.695 --> 31:44.905
Playing makes it worse.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.783
It's-- It's one
of those old subway token slots.

31:48.450 --> 31:50.244
I haven't seen one since I was a kid.

31:50.327 --> 31:53.997
Okay, so we need tokens.
Anyone see any tokens anywhere?

31:54.081 --> 31:55.207
What does that sign say?

31:55.290 --> 31:59.586
"All false advertising must be pulled."
Maybe the tokens are behind the ads?

31:59.670 --> 32:02.297
But the frames are metal,
so we need a tool to pull them off.

32:02.381 --> 32:04.424
No, wait. "All false advertising."

32:04.508 --> 32:06.969
Yeah, I noticed something earlier.

32:07.052 --> 32:09.930
Right here.
This ad for Hourglass Bay, it says:

32:10.013 --> 32:12.558
"Lose yourself in the sand."
"Yourself" is missing an E.

32:12.641 --> 32:16.353
Check all the signage. See if there are
any more misspellings. Okay?

32:19.398 --> 32:20.232
Nothing.

32:22.109 --> 32:23.402
Here! C.

32:23.485 --> 32:25.654
There's a C missing in "statistic."

32:25.737 --> 32:29.366
Okay, C, E...
They're trying to spell something out.

32:29.449 --> 32:31.994
Wait, wait, wait. What did the clue say?

32:32.077 --> 32:33.871
"All false advertising must be pulled."

32:33.954 --> 32:35.414
The missing letters...

32:36.290 --> 32:39.126
Has everybody noticed
how many handles there are?

32:39.209 --> 32:41.545
-Who counts how many--?
-Twenty-six.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.547
-Like letters in the alphabet.
-Right.

32:43.630 --> 32:46.008
We pull the corresponding handles
of the missing letters.

32:46.091 --> 32:49.344
The metal handles?
I hope no one has a heart condition.

32:49.428 --> 32:50.762
What if we use the towel?

32:50.846 --> 32:52.723
No, cotton is not a good enough insulator.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.850
Is there anything else in the bag?

32:54.933 --> 32:57.811
Wait, the lining is rubber.
We could use this.

32:57.895 --> 33:00.105
Does anybody have keys, so I can cut it?

33:01.231 --> 33:02.608
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

33:07.988 --> 33:09.698
Does anybody wanna hand me keys?

33:11.867 --> 33:12.910
My bad.

33:16.413 --> 33:17.414
Pass them down.

33:18.207 --> 33:20.792
Great. We're rubbered up.
Which one are we pulling?

33:20.876 --> 33:22.920
Hey, there's a green handle here!

33:23.003 --> 33:26.006
I noticed a red one at the other end.
Green is A, red is Z, right?

33:26.632 --> 33:27.966
Maybe this is where we start.

33:28.050 --> 33:30.302
Okay. C is the third letter
of the alphabet, so...

33:31.929 --> 33:34.389
Okay. Any objections?

33:34.473 --> 33:35.849
No, go for it.

33:35.933 --> 33:38.393
No. You got this.

33:46.818 --> 33:47.903
A C, that's one.

33:48.654 --> 33:52.366
Hey, look! Letters. Two Cs.
That's gotta mean something, right?

33:56.495 --> 33:57.454
It's getting worse.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.582
-Come on, keep moving!
-Go, go, go!

34:02.459 --> 34:03.710
-Come on!
-No shock.

34:03.794 --> 34:06.630
It must be grounded.
We need eight more tokens.

34:06.713 --> 34:11.510
Okay. "Lose yourself." A, B, C, D, E.

34:14.054 --> 34:16.681
-Yes!
-Everybody split up, look for letters.

34:16.764 --> 34:18.266
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

34:19.351 --> 34:20.811
Shit, we're running out of time.

34:21.812 --> 34:23.021
Seven!

34:23.563 --> 34:26.108
Check the back of the train.
Gotta be something there.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.360
What the hell
does half this shit even mean?

34:28.443 --> 34:29.485
There's an extra M here!

34:30.987 --> 34:32.989
-And an A! An A missing.
-I'll get the A!

34:34.116 --> 34:36.659
M! M! Ready?

34:37.327 --> 34:38.328
Go!

34:39.496 --> 34:40.581
We need five more!

34:43.667 --> 34:45.002
Oh, my God. Hey!

34:45.752 --> 34:46.587
Oh, God!

34:46.670 --> 34:48.045
-I'll get the token.
-She okay?

34:48.130 --> 34:49.380
-I got you.
-She okay?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.507
-She's fine. Keep going.
-Where's the token?

34:51.592 --> 34:52.634
This is missing a K!

34:52.717 --> 34:55.429
"Call a cab in advance."
There's an extra L here too.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.389
All right. Back to L!

34:57.472 --> 34:59.850
-You got the L? Okay!
-I got L!

34:59.933 --> 35:03.145
-Five more.
-Oh, shit. It's a game of Hangman.

35:03.228 --> 35:05.105
This is gonna suck!

35:12.863 --> 35:15.824
-This can't be happening.
-Hey! Give me the token!

35:15.908 --> 35:17.201
Give me the token!

35:18.243 --> 35:19.328
Go, man, go!

35:20.746 --> 35:22.247
Everybody stay down!

35:24.750 --> 35:26.126
Get up, Theo, get up!

35:28.086 --> 35:30.672
-Zoey, what are you doing?
-It's the proof we came here for!

35:30.756 --> 35:33.091
-Get down!
-Hurry up!

35:34.593 --> 35:36.678
Where are the other letters?

35:44.186 --> 35:45.103
There's three!

35:45.187 --> 35:46.230
Okay.

35:56.782 --> 35:59.326
Guys! Guys, I found the missing letter--

36:22.766 --> 36:23.684
He's dead!

36:23.767 --> 36:24.935
Oh, shit.

36:28.647 --> 36:31.859
-Do we know what letters he found?
-No, the map is burnt out!

36:33.527 --> 36:36.113
Zoey! Got any ideas?

36:42.494 --> 36:44.872
The missing letters are W, B, and O!

36:44.955 --> 36:47.875
-How do you know?
-I just know. Just do it!

36:58.510 --> 36:59.678
B, O!

37:08.562 --> 37:10.063
Go!

37:20.115 --> 37:21.241
One more!

37:22.492 --> 37:23.869
I'm coming!

37:24.661 --> 37:26.914
-Sleep well, brother.
-Oh, shit!

37:28.040 --> 37:30.209
Hand it to me! Give me the token!

37:39.593 --> 37:40.802
The door is open!

37:40.886 --> 37:44.223
All right! Go! Go, go! Get out of here!

37:47.893 --> 37:49.311
Come on, go!

37:54.983 --> 37:56.443
Zoey, hurry! Jump!

38:04.493 --> 38:06.161
Everybody stay down!

38:07.204 --> 38:08.205
Stay down!

38:11.834 --> 38:13.001
We're moving!

38:14.044 --> 38:15.087
We're going down.

38:30.102 --> 38:33.522
Hey, wait. Somebody just died.
Can we just have a moment?

38:33.605 --> 38:38.068
Maybe we should have a minute of silence.
I mean, we did just lose somebody.

38:38.944 --> 38:41.822
You can be as silent as you want.
They're eating this shit up.

38:41.905 --> 38:43.907
Anybody even know his name?

38:47.578 --> 38:48.412
No.

38:50.581 --> 38:51.623
I'm Brianna.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.417
I'm Nate.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.918
I'm Rachel.

38:56.003 --> 38:56.920
I'm Ben.

38:57.671 --> 38:58.755
Zoey.

39:01.008 --> 39:04.303
Hey, did the train mean anything
to anybody?

39:04.386 --> 39:07.681
It was horrible. We almost died.
Does that count?

39:07.764 --> 39:11.185
No, no, I mean,
this is all part of a puzzle, right?

39:11.268 --> 39:14.730
So for our groups,
we were all lone survivors.

39:14.813 --> 39:17.900
So if the rooms were tailored
around our accidents--

39:17.983 --> 39:20.527
Maybe the last room was designed
for the guy who died in it.

39:20.611 --> 39:23.697
Okay, well, what about your groups?

39:23.780 --> 39:27.868
-Do you think there was any connection?
-My group was all influencers.

39:27.951 --> 39:30.621
What, so your special skills were selfies?

39:30.704 --> 39:34.082
No, my special skill was travel blogging.

39:34.166 --> 39:37.794
Camping in Atacama,
elephant sanctuaries in Thailand.

39:38.545 --> 39:39.671
That kind of thing.

39:39.755 --> 39:44.218
Got a million followers, made some money,
and then this scar happened.

39:45.135 --> 39:47.346
My last room was
an exploding hall of mirrors.

39:47.429 --> 39:50.224
It's just a weird category, is all.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.684
I got a letter from my diocese.

39:52.768 --> 39:54.603
Oh, so you're a priest?

39:57.439 --> 40:02.027
It called me to some interchurch seminar
or something.

40:02.945 --> 40:06.031
-When I get there--
-Let me guess. Five more priests?

40:06.615 --> 40:08.325
Beginning of a bad joke, right?

40:09.868 --> 40:15.874
You see, in ours they wanted to see
if faith helped us survive.

40:17.167 --> 40:19.461
Well, you survived.

40:22.005 --> 40:25.634
I keep walking around up there, so lost.

40:28.387 --> 40:29.304
I mean,

40:30.013 --> 40:32.766
-I just don't understand.
-Understand what?

40:33.892 --> 40:35.519
Why God spared me.

40:36.478 --> 40:38.188
Maybe that's enough story time--

40:38.272 --> 40:39.690
Wait, wait, wait.

40:39.773 --> 40:42.109
When I won the game,

40:42.192 --> 40:45.737
some vaguely European asshole tried
to strangle me to death.

40:46.446 --> 40:48.240
Only reason I got out was because of Zoey.

40:48.323 --> 40:51.952
So, what, they just let you all go free?

40:52.035 --> 40:55.163
They gave me a hug, called me an Uber.
It was a really pleasant experience.

40:55.247 --> 40:58.709
We're just trying to find a pattern.
That's it. That's all.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.587
They're betting on something.
What's the angle?

41:01.670 --> 41:03.463
You can't outthink Minos.

41:03.547 --> 41:06.466
Trying to is just going
to put us all at risk.

41:06.550 --> 41:09.678
She's the only one here
who saved somebody except for herself,

41:09.761 --> 41:12.139
-so why not listen to her?
-I heard you on the train.

41:12.222 --> 41:15.017
Sounds like listening to her is
what got you back into this mess.

41:19.188 --> 41:20.647
Maybe we should keep moving.

41:38.999 --> 41:42.044
An art deco bank of death. Great.

41:42.127 --> 41:43.921
They built a bank underground?

41:45.214 --> 41:46.340
This is crazy.

41:47.591 --> 41:49.635
Look, the vault door's open.

41:51.678 --> 41:54.556
-There's no way it's that easy.
-Yeah, definitely not.

41:55.224 --> 41:58.435
-Clearly, they're baiting us.
-Yeah, you think?

42:00.479 --> 42:01.605
Zoey? What's wrong?

42:04.525 --> 42:05.651
Goddamn it!

42:09.363 --> 42:11.657
Security system activated.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.200
Nobody touch anything.

42:21.416 --> 42:24.169
It's the tile.
You need to step both feet off of it.

42:24.253 --> 42:26.255
-It's triggering the lasers.
-Help me.

42:26.338 --> 42:27.840
-I'm gonna guide you.
-I'm stuck.

42:27.923 --> 42:29.216
Take my hand.

42:30.008 --> 42:31.301
Just listen to me.

42:31.385 --> 42:33.929
Lower your body. Nice and slow.

42:34.888 --> 42:35.889
Slow.

42:35.973 --> 42:38.392
-Steady. Careful.
-Wait, wait, wait.

42:38.475 --> 42:41.270
You're gonna lift your left foot
and bring it over to me.

42:41.353 --> 42:42.354
Yeah, good.

42:42.437 --> 42:46.525
When you're ready. There you go.
Over to me. Nice and slow.

42:46.608 --> 42:47.901
Really low. You got it.

42:47.985 --> 42:51.029
-I got you.
-A little bit lower. You got it.

42:51.113 --> 42:52.489
On the count of three.

42:52.573 --> 42:53.532
Three.

42:54.324 --> 42:55.242
-Two.
-Two.

42:55.325 --> 42:56.869
-One.
-One.

42:56.952 --> 42:57.953
Shit.

42:59.580 --> 43:01.415
-Is she okay?
-No, no, don't.

43:01.498 --> 43:02.833
I know. Don't touch it.

43:02.916 --> 43:05.878
Yeah. It looks like
the skin is fused to the shirt.

43:06.837 --> 43:09.131
Full laser-grid activation

43:09.214 --> 43:10.966
-in ten minutes.
-Oh, shit.

43:11.049 --> 43:12.342
That is the way out.

43:12.426 --> 43:14.803
There has to be another way
across those tiles.

43:14.887 --> 43:16.513
We can't exactly test them.

43:17.347 --> 43:19.308
-Maybe we can go around?
-Great.

43:19.391 --> 43:21.143
Might as well be a mile away.

43:22.644 --> 43:24.897
Hey, guys? I think I found a key.

43:26.899 --> 43:29.359
-Inside the lollipop. It's a key, right?
-Yeah, yeah.

43:31.945 --> 43:35.908
Well, those are safety-deposit boxes.
It's gotta be for one of them.

43:39.077 --> 43:41.622
Wait, we don't know
if it's safe over there yet.

43:43.165 --> 43:44.875
This is where the clue leads.

43:46.543 --> 43:49.087
These tiles are different
than the ones in the middle, so...

43:51.632 --> 43:52.633
Zoey, be careful.

43:52.716 --> 43:54.885
Clock's ticking. We have no choice.

43:59.806 --> 44:00.641
Safe.

44:01.517 --> 44:03.435
Okay. Look for some more keys.

44:03.519 --> 44:05.312
There's more boxes on the other side.

44:05.395 --> 44:07.064
See if we can find any more.

44:12.736 --> 44:13.779
"You are here"?

44:13.862 --> 44:15.280
No shit.

44:18.951 --> 44:20.994
There's too many boxes.
We're missing something.

44:22.538 --> 44:24.414
"To be filed." Where is it?

44:31.046 --> 44:32.506
-Found a key.
-Yes!

44:32.589 --> 44:33.924
I found another key!

44:34.758 --> 44:37.344
-Try the boxes on the other side.
-We'll check over there.

44:41.557 --> 44:42.850
Brianna. Come on.

44:47.187 --> 44:49.481
Okay, this is gonna take a while.

44:51.567 --> 44:55.362
Full laser-grid activation
in eight minutes.

44:55.445 --> 44:57.281
I hate these sons of bitches.

44:57.364 --> 44:58.490
You guys hear that?

45:02.369 --> 45:04.162
Welcome to Illuminus Bank.

45:04.788 --> 45:09.084
For payment following the death
of a loved one, please enter your PIN.

45:09.168 --> 45:10.002
PIN.

45:10.878 --> 45:13.672
We need a PIN code.
What's that? Four numbers.

45:13.755 --> 45:16.341
Four numbers? Yeah, okay.
We're looking for four numbers.

45:16.425 --> 45:19.052
Let's see, is there one...?
Shit. All these are three.

45:19.136 --> 45:22.264
"Enter your PIN. Follow instructions.
Don't forget to take your receipt."

45:22.347 --> 45:24.850
"Payment." Briefcases?
"Following the death of a loved one."

45:24.933 --> 45:28.729
Full laser-grid activation
in seven minutes.

45:28.812 --> 45:31.023
Hey, come here. Check this out.

45:31.106 --> 45:33.150
All the boxes have numbers
except for this one.

45:33.233 --> 45:35.777
"Sonya." Who's Sonya?

45:36.612 --> 45:37.696
Oh, my God.

45:38.530 --> 45:41.241
Here. Only one way to find out.

45:42.075 --> 45:43.160
Come on, come on.

45:48.415 --> 45:50.125
Rachel, look, there's something in here.

45:51.251 --> 45:54.546
Shit! Shit, that's really sharp.
I'm bleeding.

45:54.630 --> 45:58.717
We got a box with the name "Sonya" on it
and some razor-sharp diamonds.

45:58.800 --> 46:01.011
-Anything else?
-We got a box like that too.

46:01.094 --> 46:05.140
It says "Sonya" on it.
And there's two stacks of blank bills.

46:05.224 --> 46:06.808
-I don't know what it means.
-Okay.

46:07.518 --> 46:11.355
Full laser-grid activation in six minutes.

46:11.438 --> 46:14.066
Sharp diamonds, blank bills,
and a chick named Sonya.

46:14.149 --> 46:15.567
We're missing something.

46:15.651 --> 46:18.195
"Following the payment
of a death of a loved one."

46:19.154 --> 46:22.449
Wait. What do you call it
when you get paid for a death?

46:23.408 --> 46:25.702
Blood money.
Hurry, bring the bills over here.

46:25.786 --> 46:27.454
They want us to put blood on the bills.

46:27.538 --> 46:29.164
Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, yeah.

46:37.714 --> 46:39.174
-Oh, no!
-Rachel!

46:40.259 --> 46:41.260
Rachel?

46:41.885 --> 46:43.053
Rachel.

46:43.136 --> 46:44.763
Hey. Are you okay?

46:44.847 --> 46:46.265
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

46:46.348 --> 46:48.642
-Counters are off-limits.
-Okay.

46:48.725 --> 46:50.561
-Priest guy, get the bills.
-The bills okay?

46:50.644 --> 46:52.813
-Yeah, this one's good.
-All right.

46:52.896 --> 46:54.940
-Bring them here. Careful.
-I hope that's enough.

46:55.858 --> 46:57.192
Okay. Here.

47:00.112 --> 47:02.531
Oh, what is that? Okay.

47:02.614 --> 47:03.782
It's working.

47:04.658 --> 47:07.578
Okay, 0-5-2-6. Try that.
Try 0-5-2-6 in the ATM.

47:07.661 --> 47:09.079
0-5-2-6.

47:09.162 --> 47:10.789
0-5-2-6.

47:11.415 --> 47:12.249
The clocks!

47:14.001 --> 47:14.918
Everyone see that?

47:15.002 --> 47:20.048
They stopped moving at 12:09 in New York,
3:02 in London, and 12:03 in Shanghai.

47:20.132 --> 47:22.259
How does that get us across the floor?

47:22.342 --> 47:24.178
Hang on. We got another clue.

47:24.261 --> 47:25.470
What is it?

47:26.388 --> 47:30.350
"Plot a course by the hours of the day.
Count the minutes every step of the way."

47:30.434 --> 47:34.229
Okay, maybe it's coordinates
like in chess. Row and column?

47:34.313 --> 47:35.647
No, wait. I see it.

47:35.731 --> 47:37.649
"Plot a course by the hours."

47:37.733 --> 47:40.277
Twelve o'clock is straight.
Three o'clock is right.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.405
That makes sense. So "Count the steps
every minute" must be the distance

47:43.488 --> 47:46.867
and that means
that 12:09 is straight, nine steps?

47:47.409 --> 47:48.952
Full laser-grid activation

47:49.036 --> 47:51.747
-in five minutes.
-How do we know where to start from?

47:54.041 --> 47:56.418
This says you start three tiles
from the left.

47:56.502 --> 47:59.463
-Three tiles from the left!
-At least, I think so.

48:00.130 --> 48:02.341
I don't know.
We're making a lot of assumptions.

48:02.424 --> 48:04.259
We gotta try something, right?

48:04.343 --> 48:05.844
Wait, I have an idea.

48:05.928 --> 48:08.055
What are you--? Where are you going?

48:11.099 --> 48:13.060
I'm gonna plot a course
for the rest of you.

48:14.144 --> 48:15.312
Careful, okay?

48:24.404 --> 48:27.032
Okay. It worked. Okay.

48:27.115 --> 48:28.158
One.

48:29.618 --> 48:30.619
Two.

48:32.371 --> 48:33.413
Three.

48:34.164 --> 48:35.832
-Come on.
-You're doing great, Nate.

48:41.004 --> 48:42.464
Okay. Okay.

48:42.548 --> 48:44.508
-Nine? Nine. Okay.
-That's nine, right?

48:44.591 --> 48:48.095
So it's 3:02 in London,
so try two steps to your right.

48:57.229 --> 48:59.648
Okay, third clock, Shanghai, 12:03.

48:59.731 --> 49:01.733
That's three steps forward.

49:04.444 --> 49:05.404
One.

49:06.363 --> 49:07.197
Two.

49:10.826 --> 49:12.286
Shit!

49:13.245 --> 49:16.290
Hey! Something opened over there.
Look, right there!

49:18.166 --> 49:21.253
It's a combination lock.
We need three more numbers.

49:21.336 --> 49:22.796
Three numbers. Okay.

49:22.880 --> 49:25.007
Hey, something's happening here.

49:25.966 --> 49:30.012
"Money makes the world turn.
Don't let it stop or else it all ends."

49:30.637 --> 49:32.055
The hell does that mean?

49:32.139 --> 49:33.807
Shit. What number?

49:35.809 --> 49:36.977
The codes in here?

49:38.896 --> 49:39.980
Come on! What is it?

49:40.063 --> 49:43.942
There's international accounts on here.
Tokyo and South Africa. Maybe that's it?

49:44.026 --> 49:47.196
Every piece of paper in here
has goddamn numbers on it!

49:48.363 --> 49:50.866
-Full laser-grid activation...
-Oh, shit.

49:50.949 --> 49:52.409
...in three minutes.

49:53.619 --> 49:54.745
We're not gonna make it.

49:54.828 --> 49:59.374
Guys, we're not gonna make it in time!
What else is there? Look!

49:59.458 --> 50:01.919
Don't panic.
We just need to keep looking, okay?

50:02.002 --> 50:03.170
Calm down, okay?

50:06.048 --> 50:07.049
Okay.

50:07.132 --> 50:07.966
Nate!

50:09.009 --> 50:10.969
What is he doing? No, no, no.

50:11.053 --> 50:13.972
-Nate! What are you doing?
-Stop!

50:14.056 --> 50:17.684
-No. Wait. Wait. Oh, shit!
-Nate! No, no, no.

50:17.768 --> 50:20.020
-Wait! What the hell? Stop it!
-Nate!

50:20.103 --> 50:22.147
Just stay there. Stay there.

50:22.231 --> 50:26.026
We don't know if those tiles are safe
because we haven't found any clues.

50:26.109 --> 50:28.403
So just stop what you're doing!

50:28.904 --> 50:30.948
-Nate!
-No! Stop!

50:31.031 --> 50:33.867
-Stop! Stop!
-Stop, please!

50:33.951 --> 50:36.328
You're gonna get us killed! Please stop.

50:36.411 --> 50:39.122
Whatever you think you're doing,
it's not helping us.

50:39.206 --> 50:40.916
It's okay. It's working.

50:40.999 --> 50:43.544
Stop for two seconds, okay? We just-- No!

50:47.422 --> 50:48.757
He's gonna kill us.

50:48.841 --> 50:51.468
This is why he spared me.
I know you're afraid.

50:51.552 --> 50:54.304
-Stop!
-I know-- I know you're afraid.

50:54.388 --> 50:55.430
Don't be afraid.

50:55.514 --> 50:58.475
-I'm not scared! Listen to her!
-You're gonna kill us!

50:59.268 --> 51:01.186
You don't need to do this, okay?

51:05.983 --> 51:07.276
Zoey! Zoey!

51:09.903 --> 51:11.947
Get him up! Come on! Hurry!

51:12.030 --> 51:13.782
Nothing happened when he hit his head.

51:13.866 --> 51:16.702
Maybe it's just the end of the counters
that are booby-trapped.

51:16.785 --> 51:18.287
Let's get him off the tiles.

51:18.370 --> 51:20.664
Let's go. Help me pull him up.

51:24.168 --> 51:25.294
Careful. Careful!

51:30.632 --> 51:31.550
That was close.

51:32.593 --> 51:34.511
-Is he okay?
-He's out cold.

51:34.595 --> 51:37.514
-We're gonna have to carry him.
-Father Nutbag torched all the clues!

51:37.598 --> 51:39.683
The papers weren't the answer.
There was too many.

51:39.766 --> 51:40.726
What's the clue again?

51:40.809 --> 51:43.896
"Money makes the world turn.
Never let it stop--"

51:43.979 --> 51:46.231
Wait. We gotta turn something.

51:49.026 --> 51:51.361
-It's stuck!
-Try turning it both ways!

51:51.445 --> 51:53.447
We were never looking for a number.

51:53.530 --> 51:55.574
"Don't let it stop."
Don't let it stop turning.

51:55.657 --> 51:57.659
-Oh, shit.
-Got it. I got it.

51:57.743 --> 51:59.077
We got something.

51:59.870 --> 52:02.623
It's a graph, a transparency.
You gotta put it on something.

52:02.706 --> 52:04.499
Maybe it goes on the map. Throw it here.

52:04.583 --> 52:06.460
Full laser-grid activation

52:06.543 --> 52:08.337
-in one minute.
-We're running out of time!

52:08.420 --> 52:09.421
Toss it over!

52:09.505 --> 52:12.090
-I'll throw it over the laser tiles.
-You have to throw it.

52:12.174 --> 52:15.594
-Throw it over! Hurry! Come on!
-Go! You got it!

52:18.931 --> 52:20.933
Okay. Okay, okay.

52:21.016 --> 52:23.477
All right. You go and I'll guide you out.

52:23.560 --> 52:24.853
I'm not leaving without you.

52:24.937 --> 52:27.731
-We need help to carry the chosen one!
-Just go.

52:27.814 --> 52:30.192
-Hurry up! We gotta get out of here.
-Shit.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.489
-I got the lollipops.
-Here.

52:35.572 --> 52:37.991
I got him, I got him. Careful, careful.

52:40.244 --> 52:43.914
-We sure we need this asshole?
-Take two tiles to the left.

52:43.997 --> 52:45.249
One, two.

52:45.332 --> 52:46.834
We're leaving you a path.

52:46.917 --> 52:49.211
Okay. Six tiles straight.

52:51.171 --> 52:53.048
Two tiles diagonally to the right.

52:53.632 --> 52:55.509
One, two.

52:55.592 --> 52:58.303
-Two tiles diagonally to the left.
-Full laser-grid activation...

52:58.387 --> 53:00.764
-One, two.
-...in ten, nine,

53:00.848 --> 53:04.601
-eight, seven, six, five...
-And then straight all the way up.

53:04.685 --> 53:08.146
...four, three, two, one.

53:24.705 --> 53:25.539
Shit.

53:37.885 --> 53:40.304
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Come on.

53:40.387 --> 53:41.263
What happened?

53:41.346 --> 53:43.765
We almost lost Zoey out there,
that's what happened.

53:43.849 --> 53:47.227
-You like being stupid and selfish?
-Okay, I'm sorry.

53:47.311 --> 53:49.646
-I'm sorry.
-Is that what you like, huh?

53:49.730 --> 53:51.064
Ben, Ben, Ben! Stop!

53:51.773 --> 53:54.318
Okay, enough! He was just trying to help!

53:57.821 --> 53:58.822
Thank you.

54:00.490 --> 54:01.992
For getting us out of there.

54:02.951 --> 54:04.578
Yeah, don't worry about it.

54:09.666 --> 54:10.834
What's happening?

54:10.918 --> 54:12.127
It's gonna collapse!

54:13.128 --> 54:14.880
Everybody run! Run!

54:15.839 --> 54:16.798
-Go!
-Run!

54:16.882 --> 54:18.842
Hurry up! Get out of here!

54:18.926 --> 54:20.677
-Go, go, go!
-Hurry up!

54:32.940 --> 54:34.358
Well, that's impressive.

54:43.992 --> 54:45.327
A full 360.

54:45.410 --> 54:48.205
-They did something like this in our game.
-Ours too.

54:48.956 --> 54:51.041
This is some next-level shit.

54:52.876 --> 54:54.920
Hundred bucks says they try to drown us.

54:55.003 --> 54:56.880
No, are you kidding?
Look at all this sand.

54:56.964 --> 54:58.507
Definitely land mines.

55:03.136 --> 55:06.181
Check this out. It's a Polaroid camera
and it says something.

55:07.599 --> 55:09.768
-What does that say?
-"It will last longer."

55:09.852 --> 55:11.103
It's like the phrase.

55:11.770 --> 55:13.438
I guess you have to take a picture.

55:24.867 --> 55:27.661
What--? What the hell was
the point of that?

55:27.744 --> 55:31.164
-It looks like a postcard, right?
-Yeah, like a memory.

55:32.666 --> 55:34.042
There's writing on the back.

55:34.126 --> 55:36.295
It says, "Drop your anchor
at Hourglass Bay."

55:36.378 --> 55:38.463
That's the name
on the billboard behind us.

55:40.132 --> 55:41.258
It's just the room.

55:41.341 --> 55:43.552
Yeah, but, no, look at the horizon.

55:43.635 --> 55:45.554
There's a tiny boat
that's not on the wall.

55:46.722 --> 55:50.100
So we're looking for something nautical.
Maybe an anchor?

55:50.184 --> 55:53.103
-Possibly surrounded by land mines.
-Would you stop saying that?

55:53.812 --> 55:55.981
Can we just be careful
what we're stepping on?

55:56.064 --> 55:59.860
-I'm gonna check by the pier.
-The exit has to be in this shack.

55:59.943 --> 56:02.738
X marks the spot? I don't know.

56:03.822 --> 56:05.574
I'll bet that fridge is our way out.

56:11.747 --> 56:13.498
You still think the rooms are connected?

56:13.582 --> 56:16.668
The beach bag on the train,
Sonya's name in the bank,

56:16.752 --> 56:18.754
even the walls changing
like they just did,

56:18.837 --> 56:22.674
it feels like it's all connected,
like it's telling a story.

56:22.758 --> 56:25.511
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel like it's about us.

56:27.095 --> 56:29.097
SOS! Our ship is sinking!

56:29.181 --> 56:32.809
-I've got a weird distress call here.
-I got a ship in a bottle.

56:32.893 --> 56:35.312
Ship in a bottle.
I'm gonna check this cooler.

56:35.395 --> 56:37.606
Let's see what's behind door number--

56:43.904 --> 56:46.823
Zoey. Now we know what that anchor's for.

56:46.907 --> 56:49.618
There's a telescope
at the top of the lighthouse.

56:49.701 --> 56:51.161
I think I found our boat.

56:54.915 --> 56:56.917
"Blind Love"? Like the Bon Jovi song?

56:57.000 --> 56:59.294
Guys, Ben figured it out.

56:59.378 --> 57:01.213
Minos is Bon Jovi.

57:03.382 --> 57:04.216
Very funny.

57:05.008 --> 57:06.552
Let's find an anchor.

57:06.635 --> 57:07.678
Careful, guys.

57:07.761 --> 57:09.721
Seriously, how did we miss this?

57:12.599 --> 57:15.102
-I don't see anything down here.
-It's just netting.

57:16.186 --> 57:17.396
Nothing here.

57:20.649 --> 57:21.608
What the--?

57:22.776 --> 57:25.487
-This has to connect to something.
-Wait, look.

57:28.198 --> 57:29.575
It's a metal detector.

57:32.786 --> 57:33.620
Does it work?

57:34.288 --> 57:35.122
Yeah.

57:36.582 --> 57:38.292
-Why is it still in my face?
-Let me try.

57:38.375 --> 57:41.044
-Sorry. Here.
-Let me see it. Thank you.

57:41.128 --> 57:43.881
My dad found a silver dollar
with one of those once.

57:43.964 --> 57:45.382
It was worth a dollar.

57:48.260 --> 57:49.428
There's nothing here.

57:49.511 --> 57:51.972
What is with these people
and these crazy-ass mannequins?

57:59.021 --> 58:00.272
It's gonna be under the sand.

58:11.408 --> 58:13.368
-Did you hear that?
-Oh, yeah.

58:14.620 --> 58:15.954
There's something.

58:17.122 --> 58:20.209
-You still thinking land mines?
-Nice and easy.

58:24.963 --> 58:26.298
-Here.
-Yeah.

58:26.381 --> 58:28.759
-Zoey, can you bring some shovels?
-Yeah.

58:28.842 --> 58:30.177
We found something.

58:36.308 --> 58:37.768
I feel something.

58:37.851 --> 58:38.894
Lose the shovels.

58:40.354 --> 58:41.188
Come on.

58:42.689 --> 58:44.358
-The anchor!
-It's the anchor.

58:47.528 --> 58:49.238
-You got it?
-Let's get it to the door.

58:52.115 --> 58:54.451
-Oh, shit. That's not good.
-It's tied down.

58:54.535 --> 58:56.078
-It's stuck.
-Pull!

58:56.703 --> 58:58.539
-All together.
-Help me grab it.

58:59.164 --> 59:00.332
Go!

59:01.416 --> 59:03.252
Pull! Keep going!

59:04.586 --> 59:06.255
It's connected to something.

59:07.172 --> 59:09.258
-What happened?
-Something's happening.

59:09.341 --> 59:11.593
Hear that?
There's something under the sand.

59:11.677 --> 59:13.387
-Guys?
-What the hell is that?

59:15.889 --> 59:17.474
Where'd it go?

59:17.558 --> 59:19.184
-This can't be good.
-The anchor!

59:22.354 --> 59:23.355
Give me your hand!

59:23.438 --> 59:25.941
-Hey! Get me out!
-Grab him! Grab him!

59:30.737 --> 59:33.699
-We're sinking! It's pulling me down!
-Get out!

59:34.575 --> 59:35.993
Grab my arm! Grab!

59:36.076 --> 59:39.246
-It's got my legs!
-We can't get any closer!

59:39.329 --> 59:41.832
-Reach! Hurry!
-Help me!

59:41.915 --> 59:43.000
Grab his hand!

59:44.751 --> 59:45.627
Come on!

59:45.711 --> 59:47.421
-Come on, stop it!
-Rachel!

59:47.504 --> 59:50.048
We need something!
We need something to get her.

59:50.132 --> 59:52.176
-Stop moving!
-I'm gonna get the ring.

59:53.969 --> 59:55.012
Come on!

59:56.680 --> 59:57.514
Rachel!

59:58.557 --> 59:59.975
-No!
-Rachel!

1:00:00.642 --> 1:00:01.518
Shit!

1:00:04.438 --> 1:00:06.690
-Give me the rope.
-You're not going down there.

1:00:06.773 --> 1:00:08.734
What are you doing? She's gone.

1:00:08.817 --> 1:00:11.445
-Listen!
-Hold this, okay? Hold this.

1:00:11.528 --> 1:00:14.823
-You're not going!
-Listen! I have to do this, okay?

1:00:14.907 --> 1:00:16.909
Nate, you're crazy. Stop! Stop!

1:00:16.992 --> 1:00:19.161
Hold him! Hold on!

1:00:21.371 --> 1:00:22.706
Just hold it tight!

1:00:27.127 --> 1:00:29.004
Rachel! Rachel, you okay?

1:00:29.087 --> 1:00:30.506
Come out of there. You can do it!

1:00:31.256 --> 1:00:33.842
-Rachel! Rachel! Grab the rope!
-Come on!

1:00:33.926 --> 1:00:36.553
-You can do it!
-Get up. Hold it!

1:00:37.888 --> 1:00:39.640
Come on! Get it!

1:00:40.974 --> 1:00:43.185
Okay. All right.

1:00:43.977 --> 1:00:45.062
Come on, Nate!

1:00:45.145 --> 1:00:46.522
Nate!

1:00:46.605 --> 1:00:50.150
Nate! Come on! Go up the rope!
Come on! Nate!

1:00:50.234 --> 1:00:52.361
Come on! Go up the rope! Come on!

1:00:52.819 --> 1:00:53.654
No!

1:00:55.072 --> 1:00:56.657
We have to help him! We have to!

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:58.951
-The rope's gone!
-He saved me. We have to save him!

1:00:59.034 --> 1:00:59.993
Bring the anchor!

1:01:00.077 --> 1:01:01.995
-Rachel!
-We can't help him.

1:01:02.955 --> 1:01:05.082
Hurry up! They're gonna sink this too.

1:01:06.291 --> 1:01:07.918
Hurry, it's going under us.

1:01:08.669 --> 1:01:10.337
-Come on, come on!
-Okay.

1:01:10.420 --> 1:01:12.214
Rachel, come on, let's go!

1:01:13.257 --> 1:01:15.092
Rachel, come on. He's gone!

1:01:15.175 --> 1:01:17.845
There's nothing we can do!
We gotta get out of here!

1:01:20.180 --> 1:01:21.515
"Bon voyage."

1:01:25.227 --> 1:01:27.229
Guys, I think this is our exit.

1:01:28.772 --> 1:01:31.275
The fridge is unplugged.
I found the power cord.

1:01:31.358 --> 1:01:34.862
Maybe if we find the other end,
we plug it in, open it, and get out.

1:01:34.945 --> 1:01:35.821
Yeah. Okay.

1:01:41.034 --> 1:01:44.288
The light switch, it looks like
the lighthouse in the postcard.

1:01:44.371 --> 1:01:46.081
There has to be a connection.

1:01:48.125 --> 1:01:49.126
Worth a try.

1:01:49.209 --> 1:01:51.628
'Cause nothing bad happens
when we touch things.

1:01:51.712 --> 1:01:53.589
Do it! We have to move.

1:01:54.298 --> 1:01:55.257
Oh, shit!

1:01:55.340 --> 1:01:56.175
Hold on.

1:02:00.262 --> 1:02:03.515
If we don't find the exit,
this whole thing's going down.

1:02:09.605 --> 1:02:12.900
Look! Look at the lighthouse.
It has a ladder on it now.

1:02:13.901 --> 1:02:16.195
-I'm gonna go check it out.
-I'm coming with you.

1:02:16.778 --> 1:02:17.779
Shit!

1:02:18.363 --> 1:02:20.532
-Help them, in case I'm wrong.
-Okay.

1:02:20.616 --> 1:02:22.034
The wood is blocking the exit.

1:02:22.117 --> 1:02:23.869
-Shit! Get it out!
-Clear a path!

1:02:30.250 --> 1:02:31.084
Careful.

1:02:35.506 --> 1:02:36.882
Clear a path!

1:02:45.182 --> 1:02:46.850
The light, it stopped!

1:02:47.601 --> 1:02:48.810
"I can't sea you."

1:02:48.894 --> 1:02:50.687
The door's clear. Did you find anything?

1:02:50.771 --> 1:02:54.107
Yeah, there's a message on the sign
and it says, "I can't sea you."

1:02:54.191 --> 1:02:56.068
But "sea" is spelled S-E-A.

1:02:56.985 --> 1:02:59.446
-I don't know.
-Come on down. We'll figure it out.

1:02:59.530 --> 1:03:02.491
The clue is "I can't sea you,"
spelled S-E-A.

1:03:02.574 --> 1:03:03.408
S-E-A?

1:03:03.492 --> 1:03:04.493
-S-E-A!
-Okay.

1:03:04.576 --> 1:03:06.537
I'm gonna go check the boat!

1:03:10.958 --> 1:03:12.334
What the...?

1:03:15.170 --> 1:03:16.088
No! No!

1:03:16.755 --> 1:03:18.298
"I can't sea you"?

1:03:18.382 --> 1:03:21.593
-I don't know.
-Sea salt shakers? I don't know!

1:03:23.554 --> 1:03:26.348
Okay. Let's see.
"I can't-- I can't sea you."

1:03:32.312 --> 1:03:33.814
Come on! "I can't sea you."

1:03:35.816 --> 1:03:38.277
-Maybe it has something to do with eyes!
-What?

1:03:38.360 --> 1:03:42.155
Not somebody's eyeballs. You can't open
a fridge with somebody's eyeballs.

1:03:42.239 --> 1:03:43.448
Okay.

1:03:49.621 --> 1:03:50.831
Shit!

1:03:59.798 --> 1:04:02.843
"Blind love" and "I can't sea you." Wait.

1:04:04.678 --> 1:04:05.929
The mannequin.

1:04:06.722 --> 1:04:08.390
Yeah, the mannequin!

1:04:11.935 --> 1:04:12.769
Shit!

1:04:13.312 --> 1:04:14.229
Come on.

1:04:15.272 --> 1:04:16.106
Come on.

1:04:19.401 --> 1:04:21.236
Shit, yeah! I got it!

1:04:24.364 --> 1:04:25.199
Shit.

1:04:25.824 --> 1:04:27.534
Zoey, I've got the plug!

1:04:27.618 --> 1:04:30.037
No, Ben, I think this is another way out!

1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:31.663
Here! Take it! Take it!

1:04:39.129 --> 1:04:41.089
It worked! Ben, go get Zoey.

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:45.177
-Zoey, we got the door open! Come on!
-I found a way out.

1:04:45.886 --> 1:04:47.554
This could be a way out of the game!

1:04:47.638 --> 1:04:50.098
Wait, wait! Zoey found another way out.

1:04:50.182 --> 1:04:52.351
What are you talking about,
she found another way?

1:04:52.434 --> 1:04:55.854
-This is the way out! Come on!
-What the hell is she doing?

1:04:55.938 --> 1:04:59.066
-They're not listening to me!
-We have to go! We don't have time!

1:04:59.149 --> 1:05:01.985
The whole room's collapsing!
Come on, it's the way out!

1:05:02.069 --> 1:05:04.613
If we keep playing,
how many of us die before this is over?

1:05:04.696 --> 1:05:08.033
We don't know where that's gonna lead.
We have to go here! This is the way out!

1:05:08.116 --> 1:05:11.078
Even if you win, what makes you think
they'll let you walk away free?

1:05:11.161 --> 1:05:12.621
Rachel. Come on.

1:05:12.704 --> 1:05:15.999
You have to trust her.
She saved my life! Hurry, let's go!

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:18.794
-Yeah. Okay.
-Wait-- Rachel!

1:05:18.877 --> 1:05:20.254
-Yeah. Go, go, go!
-Ben!

1:05:20.337 --> 1:05:22.172
You cannot cheat the game!

1:05:22.256 --> 1:05:25.926
Brianna, come on! Shit.
Come on! We don't have time!

1:05:26.009 --> 1:05:27.302
-Hurry, Rachel!
-I'm coming!

1:05:28.095 --> 1:05:29.096
Brianna, come on!

1:05:32.224 --> 1:05:33.684
-Oh, my God.
-Come on!

1:05:35.060 --> 1:05:37.229
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

1:05:38.063 --> 1:05:39.523
-Come on.
-I'm coming!

1:05:39.606 --> 1:05:40.649
-Come on.
-I'm coming!

1:05:40.732 --> 1:05:42.651
Brianna, let's go! Come on!

1:05:45.279 --> 1:05:46.613
Come on, hurry!

1:05:46.697 --> 1:05:48.740
-Brianna, come on!
-Shit. Shit.

1:05:51.326 --> 1:05:52.494
Brianna, let's go!

1:05:53.495 --> 1:05:55.747
Hurry! We're sinking!

1:06:01.670 --> 1:06:02.963
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

1:06:03.046 --> 1:06:06.300
Come on. Okay, okay.
You go in first. Yeah, I got it.

1:06:14.099 --> 1:06:15.225
Shit.

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:19.771
Hurry!

1:06:19.855 --> 1:06:21.023
Climb, Ben. Climb.

1:06:21.106 --> 1:06:22.316
Let's go! Come on!

1:06:25.277 --> 1:06:26.320
Ben!

1:06:27.362 --> 1:06:28.197
Ben!

1:06:34.119 --> 1:06:35.287
Let's go, come on!

1:06:35.370 --> 1:06:37.748
-I'm not gonna make it!
-You got it.

1:06:37.831 --> 1:06:39.333
Just make it out alive!

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:40.834
-Come on!
-Come on.

1:06:41.919 --> 1:06:43.420
Ben! No!

1:06:43.504 --> 1:06:44.630
Ben!

1:06:44.713 --> 1:06:46.507
No, no, no!

1:06:49.635 --> 1:06:51.053
We have to go now!

1:06:52.721 --> 1:06:53.847
Zoey!

1:06:54.389 --> 1:06:55.724
No, no, no!

1:06:56.517 --> 1:07:00.479
I tend to have this weird loyalty thing
for people who save my life.

1:07:03.732 --> 1:07:07.152
Zoey, come on.
You have to leave him. Come on.

1:07:07.236 --> 1:07:08.445
Zoey, it's sinking!

1:07:08.529 --> 1:07:12.032
Don't do this, Zoey!
Come on. Give me your hand!

1:07:12.115 --> 1:07:13.909
Come on, give me your hand!

1:07:44.106 --> 1:07:45.816
It's safe. Come on.

1:07:52.114 --> 1:07:54.700
I should've just gone the way
he wanted me to.

1:07:54.783 --> 1:07:56.535
Ben would still be alive.

1:07:59.121 --> 1:08:00.289
I lost him.

1:08:01.164 --> 1:08:03.041
He was my best friend.

1:08:03.750 --> 1:08:05.210
He died because of me.

1:08:06.628 --> 1:08:10.716
I lost him. He didn't even wanna--
He didn't wanna come back.

1:08:12.676 --> 1:08:15.220
It's my fault. It's my fault.

1:08:15.304 --> 1:08:16.763
Zoey, don't do this.

1:08:19.183 --> 1:08:20.475
It's Minos' fault.

1:08:21.475 --> 1:08:22.644
They did this.

1:08:22.728 --> 1:08:26.148
-No, I chose to come back into the game.
-I didn't.

1:08:27.149 --> 1:08:30.444
I mean, Brianna didn't. Nate didn't.

1:08:30.527 --> 1:08:34.488
They would have found you and Ben
one way or another. You know that.

1:08:35.782 --> 1:08:36.992
And you were right.

1:08:37.075 --> 1:08:39.368
They're never going to stop
unless we stop them.

1:08:39.453 --> 1:08:42.788
You still have your phone, right?
With the video from the train.

1:08:43.372 --> 1:08:46.502
What does it matter?
It doesn't prove anything.

1:08:46.585 --> 1:08:48.377
It's more than we had before.

1:08:49.087 --> 1:08:49.921
Right?

1:08:51.756 --> 1:08:52.591
Look.

1:08:54.051 --> 1:08:57.345
Everyone went through hell in their games.

1:08:58.846 --> 1:09:01.140
I was born with a microdeletion
in one of my genes.

1:09:01.767 --> 1:09:05.229
It affects sensation.
I can't feel physical pain.

1:09:08.106 --> 1:09:09.483
Just imagine...

1:09:10.359 --> 1:09:14.238
the kinds of puzzles
Minos came up with for the pain freaks.

1:09:15.154 --> 1:09:16.198
You're fighting back.

1:09:17.282 --> 1:09:18.533
You're doing the right thing.

1:09:21.953 --> 1:09:23.830
We have to go. Come on.

1:09:30.212 --> 1:09:31.630
Rach, do--?

1:09:34.966 --> 1:09:35.801
You hear that?

1:09:38.470 --> 1:09:40.471
Hey, there's something over there.

1:09:48.397 --> 1:09:49.314
Oh, my God.

1:10:06.832 --> 1:10:07.833
We made it.

1:10:13.422 --> 1:10:15.841
We're out. Come on. Come on.

1:10:16.425 --> 1:10:17.509
We're out.

1:10:18.802 --> 1:10:20.679
Oh, my God. We're out.

1:10:22.598 --> 1:10:25.642
Wait! Don't let it close!

1:10:31.273 --> 1:10:32.566
I don't understand.

1:10:32.649 --> 1:10:33.775
What's going on?

1:10:34.568 --> 1:10:36.111
We're still in the game.

1:10:37.446 --> 1:10:38.989
Oh, no, no, no.

1:10:42.910 --> 1:10:45.996
Oh, my God. What did they do to you?

1:10:48.207 --> 1:10:51.043
It's acid. When the timer runs out,
it rains acid.

1:10:51.126 --> 1:10:52.294
Acid? What?

1:10:52.377 --> 1:10:55.005
We have to hurry.
We have to find the keys to the bodega.

1:10:55.088 --> 1:10:57.799
If we could just get through this lock,
I think it's the way out.

1:10:58.926 --> 1:10:59.760
May 26th.

1:11:01.178 --> 1:11:04.306
-It's 0-5-2-6 again, but we need a key.
-No, but she's holding a key.

1:11:04.389 --> 1:11:07.559
-Yeah, but how does that help us?
-We have a minute left.

1:11:07.643 --> 1:11:10.812
"I'll always be watching over you"
and she's an angel, right?

1:11:10.896 --> 1:11:15.192
Wait! There's a cloud above her,
so we climb it, right? We climb it!

1:11:15.275 --> 1:11:18.737
-There's a ladder on the fire escape!
-Okay. I'll climb it.

1:11:26.036 --> 1:11:27.329
Bri, do you see anything?

1:11:27.412 --> 1:11:30.040
Why are there so many plants?
So many plants.

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:32.292
Come on, come on.

1:11:34.211 --> 1:11:37.631
-I found a key! It's stuck to the railing.
-Hurry!

1:11:37.714 --> 1:11:39.675
We only have 30 seconds left!

1:11:39.758 --> 1:11:42.427
-Come on, Brianna. You can do it!
-I got it!

1:11:42.511 --> 1:11:45.097
-Here, catch!
-Got it!

1:11:45.639 --> 1:11:46.932
Okay, try it. Go, go, go.

1:11:47.015 --> 1:11:49.518
Hurry! Get down here!
It's about to rain again!

1:11:50.185 --> 1:11:51.144
Okay.

1:11:52.521 --> 1:11:53.689
Okay.

1:11:53.772 --> 1:11:54.606
Lift!

1:11:56.942 --> 1:11:58.569
Hurry up! Lift the gate!

1:11:58.652 --> 1:12:00.612
It's another locked door.

1:12:25.262 --> 1:12:27.598
The rain stopped. They reset the timer.

1:12:33.937 --> 1:12:38.775
Conservation activists have started
a chain reaction throughout the city.

1:12:38.859 --> 1:12:40.777
With rising water costs,

1:12:40.861 --> 1:12:44.531
residents are turning
to urban rainwater collection.

1:12:44.615 --> 1:12:45.616
Water collection.

1:12:47.201 --> 1:12:50.245
-They want us to collect the rain.
-Conservation activists...

1:12:50.329 --> 1:12:51.663
Another awning came down.

1:12:51.747 --> 1:12:53.999
...have started a chain reaction
throughout the city.

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:56.877
Okay, chain reaction.
There's a chain on the phone booth.

1:13:01.173 --> 1:13:02.424
All right. Okay.

1:13:04.885 --> 1:13:07.638
All right. They want us
to answer the phone.

1:13:07.721 --> 1:13:10.557
If we collect the rain,
we can use the acid to burn through.

1:13:10.641 --> 1:13:12.643
-That could work.
-How do we contain acid?

1:13:13.435 --> 1:13:15.354
-Wait, don't touch that!
-No, it's fine.

1:13:15.437 --> 1:13:17.731
-You'll burn your hands.
-I'm fine. I don't feel it.

1:13:17.814 --> 1:13:20.526
Hydrochloric acid burns
through everything but a certain plastic.

1:13:20.609 --> 1:13:22.236
Look for anything that hasn't melted.

1:13:22.319 --> 1:13:23.362
Yeah. Right.

1:13:24.613 --> 1:13:27.115
Everything's melted, even the awnings.

1:13:27.199 --> 1:13:29.159
We only have 20 seconds.

1:13:31.119 --> 1:13:31.995
Shit.

1:13:34.373 --> 1:13:37.084
There's a ketchup bottle here.
There's a bottle hasn't melted.

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.086
Okay.

1:13:41.755 --> 1:13:44.883
PMP. Polymethylpentene. Yes, this is it!

1:13:44.967 --> 1:13:46.260
Acid won't melt this.

1:13:46.343 --> 1:13:48.637
We don't have much time! Let's go!

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:51.390
-Hurry! Get under the awning!
-All right, hurry!

1:14:18.292 --> 1:14:20.627
It worked! It worked.

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:22.921
Okay.

1:14:26.466 --> 1:14:28.093
It's working! It's working.

1:14:32.347 --> 1:14:34.516
Go, go, go! Answer it!

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.351
-Go!
-Hello?

1:14:37.311 --> 1:14:39.438
Here, let me try it. Hello?

1:14:39.521 --> 1:14:40.981
There's nobody there.

1:14:41.481 --> 1:14:43.859
Okay. "When the weather turns,
give us a call."

1:14:43.942 --> 1:14:45.861
It must have something to do with the cab.

1:14:45.944 --> 1:14:46.778
It's not working.

1:14:49.698 --> 1:14:51.200
-What are you doing?
-Stay in there.

1:14:51.283 --> 1:14:53.160
There's not enough room for all of us!

1:14:53.243 --> 1:14:55.162
-Come on, let's try.
-We're missing something!

1:14:55.245 --> 1:14:57.998
-I don't know!
-You can't stay out there!

1:14:58.081 --> 1:15:01.084
-It's not like we really have a choice!
-No, wait.

1:15:01.168 --> 1:15:04.838
-We can't do it like this. We can fit.
-Zoey, catch! Use it.

1:15:13.514 --> 1:15:15.766
Zoey! Zoey!

1:15:16.850 --> 1:15:18.310
Is she okay?

1:15:18.393 --> 1:15:20.854
"Pawnshop." Pawnshop!

1:15:22.731 --> 1:15:25.609
"Three rings." Pick up the phone
and put it back down!

1:15:25.692 --> 1:15:26.693
What?

1:15:26.777 --> 1:15:28.987
Pick up the phone and put it back down!

1:15:30.322 --> 1:15:32.282
Now pick it up on the third ring!

1:15:32.824 --> 1:15:34.368
Third ring? Okay. One.

1:15:40.415 --> 1:15:41.416
Hello?

1:15:42.209 --> 1:15:44.294
Do you see the cab?
The door, the door, the door!

1:15:48.674 --> 1:15:50.551
-Okay. Ready? Go!
-Let's go!

1:15:52.094 --> 1:15:53.595
-Go!
-Come on!

1:15:56.431 --> 1:15:58.392
-It won't open. They locked it.
-Open the door!

1:15:58.475 --> 1:16:00.060
-Get back to the booth!
-Zoey!

1:16:00.978 --> 1:16:03.814
-Try the front door.
-The booth! They're cutting us off!

1:16:06.817 --> 1:16:08.735
Zoey, it's locked! I can't get it open!

1:16:13.073 --> 1:16:14.449
-It won't open.
-They're locked!

1:16:14.533 --> 1:16:16.994
-It won't open.
-Try the front! Try the front.

1:16:17.077 --> 1:16:18.120
I-- I can't!

1:16:18.203 --> 1:16:20.622
-No, no, no!
-There's nowhere to go.

1:16:23.125 --> 1:16:24.626
Brianna, listen to me.

1:16:24.710 --> 1:16:27.337
Don't give them the satisfaction, okay?

1:16:27.421 --> 1:16:29.756
Hey! Hey, don't give up!

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:31.592
I don't wanna die.

1:16:31.675 --> 1:16:32.676
I know.

1:16:35.387 --> 1:16:36.430
Come on!

1:16:41.685 --> 1:16:43.145
Come on! Come on!

1:16:49.985 --> 1:16:51.778
We have an error in the transition chute.

1:16:53.363 --> 1:16:54.406
What's wrong?

1:16:54.489 --> 1:16:56.658
Just a malfunction. Hold on.

1:17:02.122 --> 1:17:03.123
What is that?

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:07.044
Final room.
Ready to activate as soon as you call it.

1:17:07.127 --> 1:17:08.378
Pull it up.

1:17:10.881 --> 1:17:12.883
When was this design approved?

1:17:12.966 --> 1:17:15.928
It was in the expedited changes
you delivered just a few days ago, sir.

1:17:18.555 --> 1:17:22.184
And those changes
were delivered on this, huh?

1:17:23.435 --> 1:17:24.478
I'm calling it in.

1:17:24.561 --> 1:17:28.315
Oh, no, no, no. We play through.

1:17:28.398 --> 1:17:29.733
We've been breached.

1:17:31.068 --> 1:17:35.280
Our employers have made it
very clear we continue no matter what.

1:17:36.990 --> 1:17:39.952
This is the highest bet-upon match
in our game's history.

1:17:45.082 --> 1:17:48.335
Relax. You're okay.
I've brought you to a safe place.

1:17:49.545 --> 1:17:52.714
Your head'll clear in a few minutes.
I'm tracking your father's phone.

1:17:52.798 --> 1:17:55.717
He's on his way here. I'm going upstairs
to try and buy you some time.

1:17:58.011 --> 1:17:59.137
Be careful.

1:17:59.972 --> 1:18:00.973
I'm gonna come back.

1:18:05.602 --> 1:18:06.645
Zoey?

1:18:06.728 --> 1:18:10.023
Hey. I know you're confused,
but you really gotta listen to me, okay?

1:18:12.192 --> 1:18:14.570
-There's not a lot of time.
-Who are you?

1:18:14.653 --> 1:18:17.948
I've been watching you for so long,
I forgot we're not already friends.

1:18:18.031 --> 1:18:19.449
I'm Claire.

1:18:21.994 --> 1:18:23.579
Please be careful, okay?

1:18:25.163 --> 1:18:28.000
Look, you're free to go at any time.
But I really need your help.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:31.295
-So if you could just hear me out. Please.
-Those are the clues.

1:18:33.046 --> 1:18:37.885
The subway, the rain,
the bank, the beach. It was...

1:18:39.094 --> 1:18:40.220
It's you.

1:18:41.513 --> 1:18:45.559
-The story's about you. Sonya...
-She was my mother.

1:18:46.435 --> 1:18:48.228
And the mural. That date.

1:18:48.812 --> 1:18:50.564
That was the day she died, right?

1:18:50.647 --> 1:18:52.983
I knew you'd be the one
to see me through it all.

1:18:57.821 --> 1:18:58.697
What is that?

1:19:03.869 --> 1:19:06.413
-You designed the rooms?
-You don't understand, okay?

1:19:06.496 --> 1:19:09.958
My father, he locked me in here.
He forced me to do all of this.

1:19:10.042 --> 1:19:11.335
You're a murderer!

1:19:11.418 --> 1:19:15.172
I resisted for as long as I could,
but I realized that my only way out

1:19:15.255 --> 1:19:17.966
was if I had your help,
if I gained your trust.

1:19:18.050 --> 1:19:19.551
Why would I trust you?

1:19:19.635 --> 1:19:22.888
-You killed Ben!
-Because I saved him.

1:19:22.971 --> 1:19:24.973
He's alive, Zoey. Ben's alive.

1:19:25.933 --> 1:19:27.184
What are you talking about?

1:19:27.267 --> 1:19:29.436
I built a hidden
extractor tank in the sand.

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:31.730
Ensler got him.
He's in the tunnels, he's safe.

1:19:31.813 --> 1:19:34.024
I can show you. Look. Look.

1:19:35.108 --> 1:19:36.401
See?

1:19:36.485 --> 1:19:38.070
I saved him, Zoey.

1:19:38.695 --> 1:19:42.241
-Ben?
-After I get out of here, we can get him.

1:19:42.324 --> 1:19:44.117
Get him out.

1:19:44.201 --> 1:19:47.204
-No, no, no. No. No.
-Wait, what's happening?

1:19:47.788 --> 1:19:50.415
No, no, no. No.

1:19:50.499 --> 1:19:53.377
-Wait, where'd he go?
-No! My dad's men found him.

1:19:56.547 --> 1:19:58.924
Oh, shit. Shit.

1:20:02.219 --> 1:20:03.428
Holy shit. Where is she?

1:20:05.556 --> 1:20:06.807
Where is she?

1:20:07.850 --> 1:20:09.017
Answer me!

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:12.771
I'm not gonna play
your stupid game anymore!

1:20:12.855 --> 1:20:14.356
You need to do something!

1:20:14.439 --> 1:20:17.234
I can't get him out from in here.
The only computer that has access

1:20:17.317 --> 1:20:18.902
-is in my father's study.
-What?

1:20:18.986 --> 1:20:22.072
We don't have time. I need your help.
Can you please just help me?

1:20:22.155 --> 1:20:25.158
What's this? A combination lock!

1:20:26.034 --> 1:20:29.746
Four numbers. Really original.
And a puzzle, too, yeah?

1:20:29.830 --> 1:20:32.708
I need somebody as smart as you
to help me solve that.

1:20:32.791 --> 1:20:34.293
Everything is a game to him.

1:20:34.376 --> 1:20:38.213
He said that no matter how hard I tried,
I would never figure it out on my own,

1:20:38.297 --> 1:20:39.548
which is why I need you.

1:20:41.341 --> 1:20:43.093
Okay. Where does it go?

1:20:45.762 --> 1:20:47.723
The images on the left
correspond to a code,

1:20:47.806 --> 1:20:51.018
and I only get three chances until
all the oxygen is sucked out of my cell.

1:20:51.101 --> 1:20:54.146
-I already used one on my 18th birthday.
-Okay, so--

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:56.273
Ben.

1:20:57.149 --> 1:21:00.611
Okay, so insects.
We have a mayfly and then a termite.

1:21:00.694 --> 1:21:03.739
It's an African mound-building termite.
They can live for up to 50 years.

1:21:03.822 --> 1:21:06.867
Mayflies only live a day, so maybe
it's something to do with life cycles?

1:21:07.534 --> 1:21:08.827
Oh, shit! Okay!

1:21:08.911 --> 1:21:12.915
So we have iridium, titanium, lithium.
The atomic numbers for that are 3, 22, 77.

1:21:12.998 --> 1:21:14.750
Maybe the atomic weights matter.

1:21:16.418 --> 1:21:17.503
Yeah. Okay.

1:21:18.128 --> 1:21:19.004
Damn it!

1:21:19.087 --> 1:21:20.923
Okay, moments in Greek history.

1:21:21.006 --> 1:21:24.092
The Battle of Troy, 1250 B.C.
The Olympic Games, which is--

1:21:24.176 --> 1:21:25.469
776 B.C.

1:21:25.552 --> 1:21:29.723
And then the third tile is Pericles.
He lived from 495 to 429.

1:21:29.806 --> 1:21:32.309
None of the puzzles make sense.
We're missing something!

1:21:32.935 --> 1:21:33.769
Ben, hang on.

1:21:34.895 --> 1:21:36.688
Zoey, what are you doing? Talk to me.

1:21:36.772 --> 1:21:38.690
"You'll never be able to solve it alone."

1:21:38.774 --> 1:21:41.860
You can't do it on your own.
And you're stuck in a box.

1:21:41.944 --> 1:21:44.154
Why would he do that?
Just to taunt you?

1:21:44.238 --> 1:21:47.241
Doors of perception.
If you can't see, then change the view.

1:21:47.324 --> 1:21:50.160
We don't have time.
My dad is gonna be here any minute now.

1:21:51.370 --> 1:21:54.915
What are you doing? Talk to me.
We can work this together.

1:21:57.543 --> 1:22:00.712
Doors of perception.
If you can't see, change the view.

1:22:01.713 --> 1:22:02.756
What are you looking at?

1:22:03.715 --> 1:22:06.343
-What do you see?
-It's a lenticular hologram.

1:22:06.426 --> 1:22:08.262
-What?
-I can see what you can't see.

1:22:08.345 --> 1:22:10.848
That's why you'll
never be able to solve it on your own!

1:22:10.931 --> 1:22:13.016
-What are they?
-There are three images.

1:22:13.100 --> 1:22:14.601
The first one's a pentagram,

1:22:14.685 --> 1:22:16.895
the second is a cross section
of a nautilus shell,

1:22:16.979 --> 1:22:19.690
and the third one is a DNA molecule.

1:22:19.773 --> 1:22:21.567
Maybe it's Fibonacci's sequence?

1:22:21.650 --> 1:22:24.403
No, the golden ratio exists
with all three of those images.

1:22:24.486 --> 1:22:27.614
-Wait, so, what? So 1.6?
-1.618!

1:22:30.826 --> 1:22:31.743
Shit!

1:22:36.874 --> 1:22:39.626
The golden ratio is represented
by the Greek letter phi, right?

1:22:39.710 --> 1:22:40.627
Yeah.

1:22:42.462 --> 1:22:45.174
-But how does that correspond to this?
-Lowercase!

1:22:45.257 --> 1:22:48.260
All of the tiles are in lowercase,
so the symbol for phi is...

1:22:51.263 --> 1:22:53.140
-I've got it. I got it!
-Okay.

1:22:58.770 --> 1:22:59.813
It worked.

1:23:11.283 --> 1:23:12.326
Are you okay?

1:23:12.409 --> 1:23:14.119
I'm not going back in there.

1:23:15.162 --> 1:23:16.371
Don't do this, Claire.

1:23:19.374 --> 1:23:22.920
You have any idea
what you have just done?

1:23:24.796 --> 1:23:26.507
How could you do this to me?

1:23:28.008 --> 1:23:33.388
After everything I have done for you.

1:23:44.983 --> 1:23:47.277
You let me out of here right now.

1:23:49.863 --> 1:23:51.240
-Claire.
-Ben.

1:23:52.658 --> 1:23:53.575
Claire?

1:23:55.410 --> 1:23:57.454
Claire!

1:24:06.129 --> 1:24:07.673
Zoey, hurry! This way.

1:24:07.756 --> 1:24:10.050
Zero, five, two, six.

1:24:18.058 --> 1:24:18.892
Zoey.

1:24:21.979 --> 1:24:22.855
Can you get him out?

1:24:22.938 --> 1:24:24.273
-I'm trying.
-Get him out.

1:24:24.356 --> 1:24:25.732
There's just too much root code.

1:24:26.525 --> 1:24:28.193
I have to override the entire thing.

1:24:28.277 --> 1:24:30.737
He's not gonna make it much longer.
You have to hurry up.

1:24:31.947 --> 1:24:32.781
I think I got it.

1:24:41.456 --> 1:24:42.791
Thank you.

1:24:43.584 --> 1:24:47.671
After you escaped,
the clients begged for an encore.

1:24:47.754 --> 1:24:49.840
A game of champions.

1:24:49.923 --> 1:24:51.466
We started letting people win.

1:24:51.550 --> 1:24:53.927
You're the only one
who ever really beat them.

1:24:58.098 --> 1:25:00.184
-Where's Ben?
-You already know.

1:25:00.934 --> 1:25:03.061
The coordinates. You were right all along.

1:25:03.145 --> 1:25:05.355
You know where the building is. Here.

1:25:05.439 --> 1:25:07.983
Take my dad's car.
It's not like he can stop you.

1:25:08.066 --> 1:25:10.194
What are you gonna do to him?

1:25:10.277 --> 1:25:12.988
As soon as I get far enough away,
I'm gonna call the police.

1:25:13.071 --> 1:25:14.239
He'll pay for what he did.

1:25:14.323 --> 1:25:18.994
You know they're still out there,
though, right? They can hunt you.

1:25:19.077 --> 1:25:20.996
You came here for proof, right?

1:25:22.164 --> 1:25:24.708
So I might have locked some doors.

1:25:24.791 --> 1:25:26.502
-Sir!
-Have you checked the network?

1:25:28.170 --> 1:25:31.507
Made it a little more difficult
for them to clean up their mess this time.

1:25:43.435 --> 1:25:44.728
Thank you.

1:26:25.310 --> 1:26:26.228
Ben?

1:26:26.311 --> 1:26:28.313
Hey, hey, hey, miss. You can't--

1:26:28.397 --> 1:26:29.690
-Miss, stop!
-Ben.

1:26:30.524 --> 1:26:32.401
Ben? Ben!

1:26:33.527 --> 1:26:35.070
-Ben.
-Zoey?

1:26:35.153 --> 1:26:38.699
Hey, hey, hey. She's with me.
Just give us a minute, okay?

1:26:40.325 --> 1:26:41.201
Are you okay?

1:26:41.827 --> 1:26:45.581
When I went through the sand,
there was a guy waiting.

1:26:46.498 --> 1:26:49.918
And he gave me this.

1:26:50.502 --> 1:26:52.421
I don't know if it's a threat or...

1:26:55.007 --> 1:26:56.550
I think it's a "thank you."

1:27:04.558 --> 1:27:05.434
It's over.

1:27:06.185 --> 1:27:07.394
We're safe now, Ben.

1:27:08.729 --> 1:27:09.730
Yeah.

1:27:11.190 --> 1:27:12.191
It's over.

1:27:40.552 --> 1:27:42.638
I only ever wanted to protect you.

1:27:43.347 --> 1:27:46.058
You stole everything from me.

1:27:46.141 --> 1:27:49.728
There was a time when
I could've said the same thing to you.

1:27:49.811 --> 1:27:52.564
You know that I lost Mother
long before that day.

1:27:52.648 --> 1:27:56.360
I knew she was reaching her end,
that she was making plans.

1:27:56.985 --> 1:27:58.737
So I decided to test her.

1:27:58.820 --> 1:28:00.614
Claire. You're hurting me.

1:28:00.697 --> 1:28:03.283
Still, I hoped that it wasn't true.

1:28:03.367 --> 1:28:06.578
I hoped that my own mother
could love me for who I really was.

1:28:06.662 --> 1:28:09.039
Put them back. Put them back.

1:28:09.122 --> 1:28:11.959
I want them all.

1:28:12.626 --> 1:28:14.253
I wasn't afraid.

1:28:14.336 --> 1:28:19.049
I followed my curiosity wherever it led,
and I was smarter than both of you.

1:28:20.968 --> 1:28:23.428
Parents are supposed
to love their children.

1:28:23.512 --> 1:28:26.348
They're not supposed
to throw them away like trash!

1:28:26.431 --> 1:28:27.975
Why are you crying?

1:28:28.058 --> 1:28:29.977
You need help, honey.

1:28:30.686 --> 1:28:31.854
You can help me.

1:28:32.646 --> 1:28:34.314
Not in the way you need.

1:28:34.398 --> 1:28:36.400
You're going to go away for a while.

1:28:37.442 --> 1:28:40.487
I even tried to show you
how useful I could be to you

1:28:40.571 --> 1:28:41.905
by getting rid of her.

1:28:41.989 --> 1:28:43.574
And how did you repay me?

1:28:43.657 --> 1:28:47.286
You stole all of my ideas.
You took all of the credit.

1:28:47.369 --> 1:28:48.662
Claire, calm down.

1:28:48.745 --> 1:28:52.040
I created such beautiful rooms for you,

1:28:52.124 --> 1:28:57.087
and no matter how high the profits soared,
you still censored and stifled me.

1:28:57.171 --> 1:28:59.882
Honey, we could be together.
We could be a team.

1:29:01.091 --> 1:29:03.552
You and Mom are gonna
be so proud of me...

1:29:05.095 --> 1:29:07.055

1:29:14.563 --> 1:29:16.273
Initiating purge.

1:29:16.356 --> 1:29:18.192
Claire!
