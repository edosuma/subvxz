WEBVTT

00:06.798 --> 00:08.800
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

00:09.759 --> 00:11.469
If it's about the Peterson ranch,

00:11.553 --> 00:14.597
I haven't changed my mind.
We're not buying it.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.725
And we're not turning
the barn into an Airbnb.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.980
It's not about either of those.
Although I stand by both.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.943
I'm telling you, we put
"rustic ranch experience" in the ad

00:27.027 --> 00:29.904
and people will pay us to sleep on hay
and shovel our cow shit.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.410
Fine. Ask your question.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.954
But I haven't had my coffee yet,

00:38.038 --> 00:41.583
so I won't be
my usual bright, cheery self.

00:42.334 --> 00:44.877
[chuckles] All right.

00:47.380 --> 00:51.634
When you asked Mom to marry you...
how'd you know it was the right time?

00:51.718 --> 00:55.097
Yeah, I suppose we could
turn the barn into an Airbnb.

00:57.432 --> 01:00.268
[chuckles] Come on,
seriously, was there, like...

01:01.018 --> 01:03.855
like, a moment or something?
Or did you just know?

01:05.022 --> 01:06.691
I guess a part of me knew.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.943
But there was this one day

01:09.026 --> 01:13.740
we're out in the pasture and your mom
was looking at a hoof on this heifer

01:13.823 --> 01:15.575
and the damn thing tried to kick her.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.035
She got out of the way just in time.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.206
I asked her if I could help.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.291
She said no.
No, she had it.

01:24.167 --> 01:27.044
She just walked right up and
grabbed that heifer by the ears and said,

01:27.129 --> 01:29.005
"Knock that shit off!"

01:30.882 --> 01:34.177
Anyway, that time on, I...

01:35.887 --> 01:39.015
I knew your mom
and I'd be getting married.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.270
You thinking about
asking Abby to marry you?

01:44.271 --> 01:45.355
[sighs]

01:45.438 --> 01:48.733
Yeah, I was gonna ask her before
all that stuff happened with Heather.

01:49.859 --> 01:53.905
But now I don't want her to think
that I'm just doing it 'cause of...

01:55.782 --> 01:57.659
you know, stuff with Heather.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.993
Yeah.

01:59.827 --> 02:01.704
-[sighs]
-Let me ask you this...

02:03.373 --> 02:05.500
can you imagine your life without Abby?

02:06.584 --> 02:08.378
Could live without a lot of things.

02:10.004 --> 02:11.005
Not Abby.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.383
Or Xbox.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.887
Abby or Xbox.

02:19.722 --> 02:23.017
Abby or Xbox or apricot face scrub.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.980
I think you should marry Abby.
She's a terrific young woman.

02:29.065 --> 02:29.982
On the other hand,

02:30.066 --> 02:32.109
-I'm not sure Abby should marry you.
-[chuckles]

02:34.696 --> 02:35.947
I know, she's amazing.

02:36.030 --> 02:38.783
The only thing wrong with her
is she's in love with me.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.244
That makes me question her judgment.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.247
You have a ring?

02:45.207 --> 02:46.208
I had one.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.003
I had to sell it to pay for
some of Heather's doctor's bills.

02:52.714 --> 02:53.756
But I'll figure something out.

02:53.840 --> 02:57.051
I mean, pawn shops have a tendency
to hold onto rings for a while.

02:57.134 --> 03:00.137
It's not like guns
or power tools or swords.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.270
Okay. I guess we're done.
Love you too, Dad.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.399
Do you ever shut up?

03:12.609 --> 03:15.487
Yeah, during church
or the national anthem,

03:15.570 --> 03:17.947
or when a cop says,
"You have the right to remain silent."

03:18.030 --> 03:19.282
[clicks tongue]

03:22.285 --> 03:23.370
Here.

03:25.788 --> 03:26.873
What's that?

03:32.211 --> 03:34.339
-That's Mom's ring.
-Yeah.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.883
Before that, it was your grandmother's.

03:38.676 --> 03:41.679
I think Abby would be
a great addition to the Bennetts.

03:47.352 --> 03:48.353
Thank you.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.273
I hug you now or at the wedding.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.028
I'm gonna save it. [chuckles]

03:58.154 --> 04:00.156
It's gonna be a good one. [chuckles]

04:02.325 --> 04:03.743
It's a nice ring.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.539
You know, I could probably sell this
and get a ring and a sword.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.081
Yeah. [chuckles]

04:10.458 --> 04:12.126
I really hope she says no.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.339
Hey, Dad.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.925
I can't wait. [chuckles]

04:22.595 --> 04:24.597
[theme song playing]

05:25.533 --> 05:27.577
Yeah, I don't think
it's anything too serious.

05:27.660 --> 05:29.579
Probably just something he ate.

05:29.662 --> 05:34.584
I'll come by in a couple days
and check on Tucker, see how he is.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.337
That's Drake. Tucker was our last dog.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.132
He's been dead for ten years.

05:42.299 --> 05:45.219
Oh, right. Uh...

05:46.053 --> 05:49.015
Well, compared to Tucker,
Drake's doing fine.

05:49.098 --> 05:51.017
[chuckles softly]

05:51.100 --> 05:55.104
Mash up one of them anti-nausea pills
and put it in his food once a day.

05:55.980 --> 05:59.651
Charlene puts my heart pills
in a Fig Newton.

06:01.318 --> 06:02.945
You won't take pills?

06:03.029 --> 06:05.072
Oh, no. No, I'll take 'em just fine,

06:05.156 --> 06:07.534
but that's the only way
she'll let me have a Fig Newton.

06:08.951 --> 06:10.286
[vehicle approaching]

06:11.328 --> 06:13.164
-[engine turns off]
-[door opens and closes]

06:13.247 --> 06:15.833
-Hey, Brenda.
-Hello, gentlemen.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.754
Wow, it's good to see you, Dale.
Will you be joining us for dinner?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.297
Oh, I wish I could,

06:21.380 --> 06:25.468
but, uh, my daughter's
bringing her new boyfriend over.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.805
Apparently, he does a podcast about soup.

06:30.014 --> 06:30.973
Is that a job?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.267
I'm not allowed to ask.

06:34.977 --> 06:37.730
[chuckles] Oh, Dale, before I forget,

06:37.814 --> 06:40.608
Charlene is coming in
to get her hair colored tomorrow.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.278
Now, this time, would you just tell her
her highlights look great,

06:44.361 --> 06:46.739
instead of saying,
"Where'd all the gray hair go?"

06:48.700 --> 06:52.411
Yeah, I had to spend the night
in the cooldown room on that one.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.038
-[laughs]
-[Brenda] Yeah.

06:54.121 --> 06:56.415
I won't make that mistake again.

06:56.499 --> 06:59.210
[chuckles] Not in front of
my daughter's new boyfriend.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.212
I'm meeting him
for the first time tonight.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.131
Apparently, he runs a podcast about soup.

07:06.509 --> 07:09.554
-You just told us that, you old coot.
-I did?

07:10.722 --> 07:13.015
Did I also tell you to go fuck yourself?

07:14.517 --> 07:15.560
Ma'am.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.773
-Well, that was a little weird.
-No, not really.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.359
He tells me to go
fuck myself all the time.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.988
No, he was repeating things.
I've never seen him do that.

07:27.655 --> 07:28.698
You think he's all right?

07:28.781 --> 07:30.783
I'm sure he's fine.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.286
If not, he'll tell me about it.
Probably a few times.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.167
-Yeah, no, I was...
-[chuckles]

07:40.251 --> 07:41.919
I'm calling bullshit on that.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.880
[chuckles] Hey! What's up, guys?

07:43.963 --> 07:47.049
Surprise inspection.
I got a question for you.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.051
Is everyone in here over 21?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.803
Well, I got a question for you...

07:51.513 --> 07:52.930
Do you want a free beer?

07:55.141 --> 07:57.477
-All right, inspection passed.
-[Rooster chuckles]

07:58.853 --> 08:00.146
Not so fast.

08:00.229 --> 08:02.774
Assistant Inspector Hank, here.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.696
So, guys, long time no see.
How you been?

08:08.780 --> 08:10.990
-Not great, actually.
-Oh.

08:11.073 --> 08:15.119
The nursing home cut, like,
half their staff, so I'm out of a job.

08:15.202 --> 08:16.829
Oh, shit, that sucks.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.456
Hey, is it true that old people
fuck all the time?

08:20.667 --> 08:25.212
Yeah. And sometimes they fall asleep
and you have to pull them apart.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.967
Money's already tight
with all the wedding stuff.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.719
We can't afford a videographer,

08:31.803 --> 08:35.056
so we're gonna park a cop car at
the end of the aisle and use a dashcam.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.351
That's actually why we're here.

08:39.435 --> 08:41.688
I was wondering if you needed any help.

08:41.771 --> 08:45.567
I could be a bartender,
a waitress, anything.

08:46.150 --> 08:47.569
Yeah, uh... [sighs]

08:47.652 --> 08:51.447
I'm not sure I really have it
in the budget to hire a "legal resident."

08:54.784 --> 08:57.119
[stammers] I'm sorry. Forget I asked.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.080
I didn't mean to put you on the spot.

09:00.164 --> 09:02.917
Where should we go next? Dairy Queen?

09:03.710 --> 09:06.128
No. They do background checks.

09:10.507 --> 09:12.635
Hey, you know what?

09:12.719 --> 09:15.805
Fuck it. What's the point of owning a bar
if you can't help out your friends, right?

09:15.888 --> 09:18.099
-Look, I'll take you on as a waitress.
-Seriously?

09:18.182 --> 09:22.103
Yeah. No business was ever hurt
hiring a hot girl, you know.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.772
Hooters,  Wheel of Fortune,  strip clubs.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.692
-Thank you! Oh, my God!
-[chuckles]

09:29.110 --> 09:32.404
Oh, hey, Beer Pong.
Hey, Nikki. What's up, guys?

09:32.488 --> 09:33.990
I work here now.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.576
Really? That's cool.
Can I get a beer?

09:36.659 --> 09:38.202
Uh, sure.

09:43.290 --> 09:45.960
I meant a new one,
but whatever. [chuckles]

09:47.253 --> 09:49.881
Man, Rooster, this is really cool of you.

09:49.964 --> 09:53.676
Hey, I'm doing security at
the Thomas Rhett concert this weekend.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.261
You want backstage passes?

09:55.344 --> 09:58.973
Whoa! Hold on. Seriously?
Abby loves Thomas Rhett.

09:59.056 --> 10:01.475
Oh, cool, I guess I'll be
taking Abby to the concert.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.813
Come on, man. The... [sighs]

10:05.897 --> 10:07.899
All right, y'all gotta keep this a secret,

10:07.982 --> 10:11.110
but I've been racking my brain
for ways to propose to Abby...

10:11.193 --> 10:12.486
-Oh, my God!
-You're proposing?

10:12.569 --> 10:14.446
Whoa, dude! Congrats, bro.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.908
Hey, don't worry,
I won't say nothing to nobody.

10:16.991 --> 10:17.992
Plus, all my friends,

10:18.075 --> 10:19.535
I know they don't give a shit
about you anyway, so...

10:21.037 --> 10:23.205
[chuckles] This is perfect.
'Cause I'm gonna do

10:23.289 --> 10:25.207
what I saw this guy do
at the Kenny Chesney concert.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.334
Apparently, he handed Kenny a note,

10:27.418 --> 10:31.005
and then Kenny brought him up on stage
to propose to his girlfriend.

10:31.088 --> 10:32.715
That's so romantic.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.175
Yeah, she said no.

10:35.467 --> 10:38.805
Hey, uh, I can give Thomas the note
when I meet him backstage.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.099
Tickets are yours, dude.
Rooster, we still owe you one.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.311
Yeah? How much of one,
like a DUI or...

10:46.228 --> 10:47.396
kill a guy?

10:49.023 --> 10:51.901
Hell, if I'm the first one on the scene,
you could do whatever you want.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.027
[chuckles]

10:56.322 --> 10:58.074
-[vehicle approaching]
-[dog barking]

10:58.700 --> 10:59.701
[clinking]

11:03.245 --> 11:04.371
What the hell?

11:10.461 --> 11:14.423
Hey, Dale, I thought you weren't
coming by until tomorrow.

11:15.591 --> 11:17.343
And I thought we were friends.

11:17.426 --> 11:20.054
Well, if I gave you
that impression, I'm sorry.

11:22.098 --> 11:25.434
Now, see, I'm used to you
insulting me to my face.

11:25.517 --> 11:29.563
What I don't like is
you gossiping behind my back

11:29.646 --> 11:33.317
like you're Vicki from
The Real Housewives of Orange County.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.320
What the hell are you talking about?

11:36.403 --> 11:41.743
Brenda told Charlene that you think
my cheese has slid off my cracker.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.245
She did what?

11:44.328 --> 11:47.331
She says you're going around
telling folks that I'm senile.

11:47.414 --> 11:49.541
I've never said you're senile.

11:49.625 --> 11:51.919
I've said you're blind.
I've said you're deaf.

11:52.003 --> 11:53.921
I've said you dress like a rodeo clown.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.174
Then what the hell happened?

11:57.258 --> 12:01.720
Well, I... I noticed you were
repeating yourself a lot.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.430
And so did Brenda.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.851
Well, that's no more Brenda's business
than it's Charlene's business

12:06.934 --> 12:10.980
that you stop twice as often
to take a piss as you used to.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.774
I'm drinking more water now.

12:12.857 --> 12:17.194
Bullshit. You have a prostate
as big as your mouth.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.657
-Are you finished?
-Why?

12:22.909 --> 12:24.618
You gotta go take a pee, Beau?

12:25.995 --> 12:28.664
All right, you know what?
I'm gonna stop worrying about you.

12:28.747 --> 12:31.708
You can drop dead on my porch,
I won't tell a damn soul.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.377
-Good!
-Fine!

12:33.460 --> 12:36.422
I'll come back in a day or so
and check on Drake,

12:36.505 --> 12:40.843
and I'll bring a bottle of Chardonnay
so you can share with your gal pals.

12:42.719 --> 12:45.807
Send up a flare if you get lost
walking back to your truck.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.394
I'll be back in a couple of days
to check on Drake.

12:50.477 --> 12:53.272
-Dale...
-And that is not a repeat,

12:53.355 --> 12:55.607
that is a confirmation!

13:00.696 --> 13:01.738
Hey.

13:02.406 --> 13:04.450
Look, I didn't wanna
put you on the spot last night...

13:05.868 --> 13:07.744
but Dad gave me
Mom's ring to give to Abby.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.374
Got real emotional.
We had a big hug.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.381
I think he's gonna buy me a sword,
but whatever. [clears throat]

13:20.591 --> 13:24.803
I just, uh, wanna make sure you're cool
with it since you're the older brother.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.098
Yeah, it's totally fine.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.016
I'll just take it when she says no.

13:30.309 --> 13:33.145
Hey, Nikki, these two beers
are for that couple over there.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.900
Again? God, it's like
every half hour with them.

13:39.651 --> 13:40.652
[cell phone rings]

13:43.614 --> 13:46.408
Oh, uh...
Sorry, I have to take this.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.036
It's wedding stuff.
Hank, you mind?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.830
Uh, okay.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.766
-Hey, baby.
-Hi.

14:12.434 --> 14:14.020
Rooster, can I get a beer?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.188
Yes, you may, and it's on the house.

14:17.106 --> 14:19.066
I think we both know why.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.693
I'll pay.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.157
Listen, you're not gonna believe this,
but I can't go to the concert.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.783
What? Why?

14:27.867 --> 14:30.577
[sighs] Well, there's a meteor shower,

14:30.661 --> 14:33.039
and I forgot that
I told the astronomy club

14:33.122 --> 14:35.958
that we'd camp out and watch it
from the football field. I'm so sorry.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.459
[stutters] Okay. Abby,

14:37.543 --> 14:40.629
first off all, the astronomy club
on the football field? What the fuck?

14:43.215 --> 14:46.260
-You gotta bail on that!
-No, I can't.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.387
I promised these kids
and I'm gonna honor it.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.681
This is the reason why I became a teacher.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.475
This might be one of the moments where
a student looks back on this and says,

14:53.559 --> 14:57.396
"That's when I decided to go to college.
That's when I changed my life."

14:57.479 --> 15:00.900
Okay, Billy got us backstage passes.
We get to meet Thomas Rhett.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.484
Fuck the kids!

15:04.695 --> 15:09.700
What...
I get to touch Thomas Rhett? [chuckles]

15:09.783 --> 15:12.286
Yeah, and spend quality time
with your boyfriend, who you love.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.370
[chuckles] Yeah, whatever.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.374
They need two more beers.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.716
-Thank you. See you in a few weeks.
-Okay.

15:25.799 --> 15:26.968
Hey, Melissa.

15:27.051 --> 15:28.844
Hey, this is a nice surprise.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.055
Well, I had to go to the feed store,

15:31.138 --> 15:33.224
-so I thought I'd stop by.
-Oh.

15:33.307 --> 15:36.393
Did you tell Charlene
that I thought Dale was losing it?

15:36.477 --> 15:38.479
What? No.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.941
Well, I said that you and I thought
that he seemed a little off,

15:42.024 --> 15:44.526
but mostly we talked about
Heidi Meyer's fake tan.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.363
If you want us to believe it's real,
don't be showing up at Clark's Market

15:47.446 --> 15:49.365
in Crested Butte
when you said you'd be in Cabo.

15:51.325 --> 15:54.745
Why'd you do that?
I was gonna tell him in my own time.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.956
Well, Charlene was a little worried.

15:57.039 --> 15:58.665
She thought that
she might be imagining things,

15:58.749 --> 16:00.001
so I just told her that she wasn't.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.255
Damn it. I didn't want to put him
on the spot and embarrass him.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.967
Now he's pissed off 'cause he thinks
I'm talking behind his back.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.387
Apparently, I'm some sort of
Orange Housewife.

16:13.680 --> 16:17.309
Well, my friend asked my opinion,
so I gave it to her. I'm not gonna lie.

16:18.019 --> 16:22.064
I'm not asking you to lie.
I'm just asking you to do what I do.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.275
Don't talk to anybody.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.111
But that's not who I am.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.571
When I've got a friend in need,
I do whatever I have to.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.283
Yeah. It's just...

16:33.909 --> 16:36.620
Why in the hell do you
have to be so nice to everyone?

16:37.288 --> 16:39.581
Takes fewer muscles
to smile than to frown.

16:39.665 --> 16:42.084
-So you're just lazy?
-[chuckles]

16:44.586 --> 16:47.506
Look, I am sorry if Dale's upset with you.

16:47.589 --> 16:51.552
But the most important thing is...
that we make sure he's okay.

16:51.635 --> 16:52.886
Yeah.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.557
I'm sorry if I came in
with a head of steam.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
That's okay.

17:00.477 --> 17:02.438
Wow, we just had our first fight.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.482
Should we kiss and make up?

17:11.447 --> 17:12.448
Brenda...

17:13.490 --> 17:16.660
it's daytime and your blinds are open.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.912
[gasps] Oh.

17:22.333 --> 17:24.251
Hey, let me ask you a question.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.920
Did you have an employee who was, like,

17:27.003 --> 17:28.964
completely worthless
at every task you gave 'em?

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
Yes, I have.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.096
Oh, yeah, I get it. Fucking Colt.

17:37.013 --> 17:38.849
[sighs] You know,
it's just that I hired Nikki

17:38.932 --> 17:40.016
'cause she's a friend, right?

17:40.101 --> 17:42.269
But it's like she's distracted,

17:42.353 --> 17:44.688
she can't take orders,
she drinks on the job.

17:44.771 --> 17:47.483
[chuckles] I mean, could you imagine
having an employee like that?

17:50.486 --> 17:51.612
Yes, I can.

17:53.614 --> 17:54.490
Yeah.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.699
Fucking Colt.

17:58.952 --> 18:02.581
Rooster, you're about
the most loyal person I know.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.252
It's the reason you put up with my
grumpy ass for all these years.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.130
It's the reason you're here,
helping your mom.

18:09.213 --> 18:11.423
And it's probably why
you hang on to that beard

18:11.507 --> 18:13.634
when everyone tells you it looks stupid.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.805
What? No one says that.
This beard is awesome.

18:20.266 --> 18:23.894
And you're loyal to your friends.
That's why you're in this situation.

18:25.146 --> 18:27.063
The way I see it, you got two choices.

18:27.148 --> 18:30.567
You can fire her
or find out what she's good at.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.862
People come up to me all the time,
tell me how badass my beard is.

18:36.031 --> 18:39.075
A great mustache does not
need a supporting cast.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.875
I like your beard.

18:48.752 --> 18:50.629
Thanks, Hank.
I wish you were my dad.

18:51.838 --> 18:53.465
Who says I'm not?

18:54.508 --> 18:57.928
What's up, Mr. Rooster?
I call you that 'cause you're my boss.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.971
[chuckles] Yeah, that's cute.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.766
Look, Nikki, we need to talk.

19:02.849 --> 19:06.853
Oh, God, you're gonna fire me.
This is just like the nursing home.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.815
Except I didn't leave anyone outside here.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.860
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.279
I'd keep you on
if the situation were different.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.489
You know, like,
if I had more customers or...

19:18.574 --> 19:19.908
you were good at your job.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.870
Well, I can get a bunch of my friends
from community college to come.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.707
You can? Well, I mean,
that'd be awesome.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.210
Yeah, just tell 'em all...
Wait, you go to college?

19:29.793 --> 19:32.003
Yeah, and my friends drink a ton.

19:32.087 --> 19:35.257
My friend Jane had
her stomach pumped twice.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.386
Well, fucking A. Get Jane down here.
You know, we're close to the hospital.

19:40.887 --> 19:42.973
I'll put an invite on Facebook right now.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.434
Uh, what's the name of this place?

19:48.144 --> 19:50.689
-Uh, Maggie's.
-Mmm, I don't think so.

19:52.899 --> 19:54.067
I'll go check outside.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.821
Oh, by the way,
table two needs another round.

19:59.155 --> 20:00.241
I'm on it.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.163
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hi.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.457
-Oh, man!
-[Abby chuckles]

20:08.540 --> 20:09.708
-Oh...
-Hi.

20:09.791 --> 20:11.918
Hey, hey, I'm gonna have him sign my hat.
How about you?

20:12.002 --> 20:13.169
[chuckles] My boobs.

20:14.004 --> 20:16.131
I'm kidding. Unless you're cool with it.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.799
I am not.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.635
[sighs] Fine, my hat. Lame.

20:20.261 --> 20:21.220
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hi!

20:21.303 --> 20:22.804
-I'm Thomas Rhett, nice to meet you.
-Hey. [chuckles]

20:22.888 --> 20:24.390
-Hey, how are you doing?
-We are huge fans.

20:24.473 --> 20:25.516
We're from Colorado.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.600
-Oh, cool.
-I don't know why I said that.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.394
We're in Colorado.
Will you sign my boobs?

20:29.144 --> 20:31.480
-Uh, I'm actually married.
-Oh, I don't care.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.648
-[laughs]
-[Colt chuckles] Oh.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.024
She's kidding, she's kidding.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.443
I'm Colt Bennett.
This is my girlfriend, Abby Phillips.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.029
Cool. Colt Bennett.
How do I know that name?

20:39.112 --> 20:41.948
Oh, I played a little football.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.159
Oh, that's it!
Oh, well, I grew up in Nashville.

20:44.243 --> 20:47.871
Oh! Yeah, yeah, I played, like,
a half a season for the Nashville Kings.

20:47.954 --> 20:48.955
[stammers] You catch a game?

20:49.039 --> 20:52.501
No, I was working at McDonald's
when you hit that kid in the drive-thru.

20:54.503 --> 20:58.214
[stammers] Okay, I just grazed his bike.
We settled out of court.

20:58.299 --> 21:00.467
-Oh. Okay.
-You hit a kid?

21:00.551 --> 21:01.718
No, I did not hit a kid.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.969
You know, it was bullshit anyway.

21:03.053 --> 21:04.971
Kid was way too old for training wheels.

21:06.307 --> 21:07.308
Do you wanna get a picture?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.475
-Yes!
-Whoa! Yeah!

21:08.559 --> 21:09.560
-Okay, yeah.
-[Abby laughs]

21:09.643 --> 21:11.061
-Well, hop in here.
-Yeah. All right, yeah.

21:13.980 --> 21:15.732
-Perfect. Thank y'all so much.
-Okay! Thanks! [chuckles]

21:15.816 --> 21:18.234
-Have a good time at the show.
-Oh, oh, hey, Thomas,

21:18.319 --> 21:19.653
-one more thing.
-Thanks.

21:19.736 --> 21:22.238
Thomas. Thomas. I got... [sighs]

21:24.325 --> 21:26.034
-You hit a fucking kid?
-[sighs]

21:26.117 --> 21:28.454
The court sealed the case.
I don't have to talk about this!

21:31.457 --> 21:32.874
[vehicle approaching]

21:36.670 --> 21:39.255
I'm glad you're here, Dale.
I was hoping we could talk.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.344
I've come to see Drake.
Come here, boy.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.680
If you wanna say anything to me,
you can tell Brenda

21:46.763 --> 21:49.725
and Brenda'll tell Charlene
and Charlene will tell me.

21:51.142 --> 21:53.770
Oh, come on, Dale, even on  Housewives,

21:53.854 --> 21:57.065
Gretchen listened when Vicki said
she wanted to apologize

21:57.148 --> 21:59.109
about calling her a hot mess.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.446
Colt showed me an episode.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.199
If you wanna apologize,

22:06.282 --> 22:09.328
comparing me to Gretchen
is a damn poor way to start.

22:11.538 --> 22:13.957
Come on. Got out the good whiskey.

22:14.040 --> 22:17.336
You mean,
I'm-sorry-I-was-an-asshole whiskey?

22:17.419 --> 22:19.045
I'm surprised you have any left.

22:22.674 --> 22:26.219
I should have come to you,
made sure you were all right.

22:26.302 --> 22:27.303
I'm fine.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.933
-I can do 20 push-ups right now.
-Well, go ahead.

22:32.976 --> 22:35.437
Well, I don't mean "right now" right now.

22:37.188 --> 22:39.941
I ain't wearing my push-up Wranglers.

22:42.486 --> 22:45.071
Look, we're both getting up there.
There ain't any shame in it.

22:45.947 --> 22:48.534
Our bodies, our minds,
everything's falling apart.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.285
I feel like an old Ford.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.370
Or a new Chevy.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.833
Yeah, getting old sucks.

22:56.917 --> 23:01.379
I used to be able to buck 100 bales
of hay without breaking a sweat.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.467
Now, I got to take a nap
after eating dairy.

23:08.386 --> 23:11.598
I do like being able
to clean my teeth in a cup.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.811
I talked to Charlene.

23:17.145 --> 23:19.731
I'm gonna go to the doctor
and make sure everything's all right.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.900
Well, that's the right thing to do.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.986
Just be prepared...

23:25.070 --> 23:26.613
The nurse is a man.

23:29.825 --> 23:34.245
-[sighs] What if they give me bad news?
-They're not gonna give you bad news.

23:34.913 --> 23:36.582
But, hey, if they do...

23:36.665 --> 23:40.544
by the time you get to the truck,
you won't remember anyway.

23:40.627 --> 23:41.628
[chuckles]

23:44.214 --> 23:46.467
[Thomas]  ♪ My, my T-shirt ♪

23:47.509 --> 23:49.094
♪ Yeah ♪

23:49.177 --> 23:51.472
-♪ You were wearin' my T-shirt ♪
-[cheering]

23:51.555 --> 23:54.475
Excuse me. Pardon me.
Pardon... Excuse me.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.811
Excuse me. Make-A-Wish kid coming through.

23:57.894 --> 23:59.605
-[Abby grunts]
-Why don't you cough or something, baby?

23:59.688 --> 24:01.272
Colt, that is awful.

24:01.356 --> 24:02.649
Move, please.

24:02.733 --> 24:05.193
-[coughs]
-Yeah, attagirl.

24:05.276 --> 24:07.613
Holy shit!

24:07.696 --> 24:08.780
[whoops]

24:08.864 --> 24:11.575
We're so close
I can see the dip can in his jeans.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.953
Thomas! Thomas! Down here!

24:15.036 --> 24:18.248
-I'm the guy who hit the kid! Thomas!
-Colt!

24:18.331 --> 24:21.167
-What are you doing?
-I wanna request a song.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.919
Oh, here, I'll do it.

24:23.003 --> 24:24.921
Thomas! Look at my boobs!

24:28.717 --> 24:29.926
[Colt] Shit. He didn't see it.

24:30.010 --> 24:32.971
-[sighs] All right. Well, I gotta go pee.
-What? No, you can't go!

24:33.054 --> 24:35.932
Colt, in two minutes, I'm peeing.
The only question is where.

24:39.603 --> 24:42.480
-Go in here.
-Are you high? I'm going!

24:42.564 --> 24:45.609
Excuse me.
Sick kid coming through. [coughs]

24:48.361 --> 24:49.445
Thomas!

24:50.363 --> 24:54.743
Thomas! Hey! Hey! Bring me up, man!

24:54.826 --> 24:57.370
What the fuck? [grunting]

24:58.830 --> 25:01.750
-What the hell?
-Oh, I'm sorry, dude, I tripped.

25:04.210 --> 25:06.254
Thomas, look at the fucking note.

25:12.803 --> 25:13.804
Excuse me.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.140
Hey, here you guys go.

25:18.684 --> 25:22.145
[sighs] Nikki, this is crazy, man.
I've never seen this place so packed.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.397
Oh, by the way, the hospital called.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.482
They pumped Jane's stomach
and she's doing fine.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.571
So I'm not fired?

25:30.654 --> 25:32.781
No, you did awesome.
You gotta keep this up.

25:32.864 --> 25:36.242
[chuckles] Great. 'Cause this job
means, like, everything to me.

25:36.326 --> 25:38.662
-Uh...
-Um, okay, I'll be back in a few.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.956
I'm gonna go get high in my car.
[chuckles]

25:42.583 --> 25:43.667
Nikki, what are you doing?

25:44.292 --> 25:45.460
That's what the bathroom's for.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.298
What the hell kinda college
is she going to?

25:52.801 --> 25:56.554
Hey, what's up? I'm Rooster.
I run the place.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.600
Hey, I'm Brittany. Cool beard.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.351
[chuckles] I fuckin' knew it!

26:03.770 --> 26:04.938
Do people call you Rooster

26:05.021 --> 26:07.565
because they want you to be the one
to wake them up in the morning?

26:08.149 --> 26:09.860
Oh, shit. You are trouble.

26:11.152 --> 26:12.863
-What are you drinking, Brittany?
-Just a Bud.

26:13.947 --> 26:16.908
Just a Bud, huh. All right. [sighs]

26:16.992 --> 26:20.120
Well... this one's on the house.

26:20.203 --> 26:23.206
We'll call it the, uh,
pretty lady discount.

26:23.289 --> 26:25.416
Well, aren't you sweet?

26:25.500 --> 26:27.335
-I hope I see you later.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.674
[sighs] Oh, hey, was that your girlfriend?

26:32.758 --> 26:34.342
'Cause if it is... [clicks tongue]

26:34.425 --> 26:36.052
she's definitely cheating on you.

26:38.304 --> 26:40.682
I'm with the Colorado
Liquor Enforcement Division.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.018
You just served alcohol to a minor.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.895
I'm going to need to
see your liquor license.

26:44.978 --> 26:48.774
Not so fast.

The bathroom line was so long,
so I went and got a beer.

27:02.453 --> 27:04.622
But then by the time I got into
the bathroom, I finished that beer.

27:04.706 --> 27:06.082
So I went back and got another beer,

27:06.166 --> 27:08.501
and then I had to go to the bathroom
again because of the first beer.

27:08.584 --> 27:09.753
Oh, then on the way here,
I spilled your beer,

27:09.836 --> 27:10.837

27:45.580 --> 27:47.290
Haven't you ever been
in a drunk tank before?

27:47.373 --> 27:49.667
Hundreds of times. But never sober.

27:50.543 --> 27:52.045
All right. Yeah, I'm busting out.

-Shut up, Billy.
-All right, I'll just leave you two alone.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.437
I'm sorry, Abby, but trust me,
I had a real good reason.

28:09.520 --> 28:10.981
Oh, you always have excuses.

28:19.530 --> 28:21.241
But trust me, this is legitimate.

28:21.324 --> 28:23.284
So then why did you do it?

28:24.911 --> 28:25.912
I can't tell you.

28:25.996 --> 28:29.082
[sighs] Of course you can't.
Why do you do shit like this, huh?

28:29.165 --> 28:32.002
-Are you ever gonna grow up?
-Abby, I got a good reason.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.837
Yeah, that you can't tell me. [sighs]

28:33.920 --> 28:36.047
-I just can't... Find your own way home.
-All right, fine.

28:36.131 --> 28:39.801
You know what? The reason I got on stage
tonight is 'cause I was gonna to do this.

28:39.885 --> 28:40.886

You are the greatest thing

tonight included...

28:53.064 --> 28:54.315
you're always there for me.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.652

I'm kneeling on broken glass.
