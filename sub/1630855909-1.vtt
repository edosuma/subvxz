WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:08.842
Any clue when our...
houseguest is finally gonna leave?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.552
It’d be nice to have
the living room back.

00:10.552 --> 00:12.178
I keep tripping on all his top hats.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.638
He’s always messing with my TiVO!

00:13.638 --> 00:16.182
It’s an antique,
the buttons are fragile!

00:16.182 --> 00:17.976
Big surprise that Dad’s avoiding
all this.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.229
Guys, he’s a family friend,
he can stay as long as he needs.

00:21.229 --> 00:24.399
Hey, so I just sold some drugs
to the weird little dude in there,

00:24.399 --> 00:25.692
he said you had cash?

00:26.025 --> 00:28.361
Oh, you kids in school?
You having trouble focusing?

00:28.361 --> 00:30.196
Okay, that’s it!
Morty, find your grandfather

00:30.196 --> 00:31.781
while go I talk to our houseguest

00:31.781 --> 00:32.991
Jerry, pay the dealer.

00:32.991 --> 00:35.285
Yeah, I prefer the term pharmacist.

00:35.285 --> 00:36.286
So do they!

00:37.120 --> 00:40.707
- Any chance you have...
- Sorry, I left my wallet in space.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.209
Are you leaving to get it?

00:44.919 --> 00:47.380
Mr. Poopybutthole,
this has gone far enough.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.841
We have been really
cool to you in your time of need.

00:50.967 --> 00:54.471
I agree, Beth.
I’m a pieeeece of garbage.

00:54.929 --> 00:58.641
Can you boost me up so
I can hook my belt to the ceiling fan?

00:58.641 --> 01:00.059
We don’t have a ceiling fan.

01:00.059 --> 01:03.229
Ooo wee, is that why it’s so hot?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.190
They’re not expensive.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.235
Bet you didn’t expect to see me in
a cold open, huh?

01:09.569 --> 01:12.572
Looks like I’ve taken another turn
for the worse.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.950
- It all started when Beth shot me.
- I said I was sorry!

01:15.950 --> 01:18.578
I know.
It tore you up inside...

01:18.953 --> 01:20.747
- Like a bullet.
- It was an accident!

01:21.331 --> 01:24.125
Anyway,
then I got fired from my job,

01:24.125 --> 01:27.420
my wife left me,
I broke both my legs,

01:27.420 --> 01:28.963
failed the bar exam.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.925
Ooo wee, things went downhill
from there.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.552
So I’ve been crashing
with the Smiths for a while.

01:34.552 --> 01:39.641
Ooo wee, I’m Mr. Popybutthole
and this is Rick and Morty Season 7.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.636
Hey buddy. Brought you a coffee.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.472
I can synthesize coffee. You don’t
need to make excuses to come see me...

02:19.472 --> 02:21.057
Yeah I knew you’d say that
so I didn’t even bring a cup.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.184
Any progress?

02:23.184 --> 02:26.646
Yes, Morty, I found the version of me
that killed my wife. You just missed it.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.856
Okay, I get it.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.858
I had a big sword fight with him
on top of Hoover Dam,

02:29.858 --> 02:31.484
then he fell and landed
on a sharp spike,

02:31.484 --> 02:33.528
whispered “thank you” like a werewolf.

02:33.528 --> 02:34.904
Was asking to be polite.

02:34.904 --> 02:37.448
The family wants you upstairs
to deal with Mr. Poopybutthole.

02:37.448 --> 02:38.658
It’s finally time, huh?

02:38.658 --> 02:41.119
Well, lucky for you guys, I know how
to make someone leave.

02:41.744 --> 02:44.747
Family. I present to you, RoboGhost.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.332
- Rick!
- Your plan is to scare him away?

02:46.332 --> 02:47.333
- Avoidance much?
- I’m listening.

02:48.042 --> 02:49.335
Assembling body.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.716
Activating sentience.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.844
Uploading business.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.141
Unfinished business detected.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.517
Terminating body.

03:10.648 --> 03:13.860
Okay. I need to make gravity part of its
finished business

03:13.860 --> 03:15.403
and leave floors unfinished.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.197
- Starting over.
- Dad, you can’t keep putting this off.

03:18.197 --> 03:20.074
- You’re doing an intervention with us.
- Nope.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.243
Then we’re sticking Poopybutthole
downstairs with you.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.163
What is this? Is this an intervention
of me not intervening?

03:25.163 --> 03:28.333
You know this can’t make the concept
work, not comedically or clinically,

03:28.333 --> 03:30.335
its success rate is ten
percent in both areas.

03:30.335 --> 03:33.004
Then you have to help him on your own.
And not with a ghost.

03:35.298 --> 03:36.549
O, that-that’s interesting,

03:36.549 --> 03:38.551
you kind of gave him a little
power by mentioning him.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.054
There’s a lot of science
to unpack about ghosts.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.682
After I talk to my friend.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.517
He’s in the living room, Rick.

03:46.517 --> 03:48.019
I’m not doing this by myself.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.771
Oh, so you’re going to have
an intervention?

03:49.771 --> 03:52.231
No. I’m going to get some friends
to help me talk to a friend

03:52.231 --> 03:54.984
and you’d know the difference if you
weren’t stupid and had friends.

03:54.984 --> 03:57.362
- You’re mean! Dad!
- Pick your battles, honey.

03:57.946 --> 03:58.905
Yeah fuck you, Summer.

04:00.114 --> 04:01.658
- God damn it.
- Your portal closed.

04:01.658 --> 04:04.452
Oh did it? Have an intervention
or we’ll intervention you,

04:04.452 --> 04:05.787
you bunch of stupids.

04:08.498 --> 04:10.833
Gearhead! Buddy! Listen.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.544
We gotta help Mr. Poopybutthole.
He’s in a bad place.

04:13.544 --> 04:17.840
Well that sounds like an intervention,
which Gearhead no Likehead.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.926
It’s not an intervention.
And you owe me.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.220
Okay fine, but now I need a drink.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.471
Make it to go and make it two.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.016
Rick, you son of a squanch!

04:27.016 --> 04:28.935
Squanch!
Told you he wasn’t dead.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.978
We squanching?

04:29.978 --> 04:32.939
A little, we need to have a hang with
Poopybutthole and talk to him about...

04:32.939 --> 04:33.982
His drinking.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.275
Us? Not without a squanch.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.194
- I’d love one if you’re pouring.
- Make it three.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.781
You left a Gromflomite femur in the compost.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.367
Your human side is
passionate but careless.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.869
I also
found your Federation hit list.

04:46.869 --> 04:48.287
Don’t go through my stuff!

04:48.287 --> 04:49.914
This place is worse than prison.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.505
- Rick.
- BP!

04:57.505 --> 04:58.506
It’s been a minute.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.633
Is... someone here?

05:00.633 --> 05:02.510
- Birddaughter.
- You found her.

05:02.510 --> 05:05.930
Yes. She was imprisoned in a femme
fatale training camp.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.975
That’s great! Let’s go celebrate
with our closest friends

05:08.975 --> 05:11.811
by encouraging Poopybutthole to dial
back his drinking!

05:13.021 --> 05:15.565
Suspect.
But I find fatherhood exhausting

05:15.565 --> 05:18.693
and would like to show my daughter
what real selfishness looks like.

05:18.693 --> 05:21.112
Perfect!
Now, do we know anyone sober?

05:23.781 --> 05:25.825
- Have you been drinking?
- On a Thursday?

05:25.825 --> 05:26.826
He seems ideal.

05:27.910 --> 05:31.205
- So where to? A coffee shop?
- No. He’ll know something’s up.

05:31.205 --> 05:33.166
Yeah! and I’m not squanching just
coffee!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.667
Let’s squanch him to a bar!

05:34.667 --> 05:36.210
It would undercut our messaging.

05:36.210 --> 05:37.795
So it is an intervention.

05:37.795 --> 05:39.589
No! We’re not asking
anybody to stop drinking

05:39.589 --> 05:42.967
because we’re not hypocrites or
squares, we’re just concerned friends.

05:42.967 --> 05:46.137
Then we can at least do it
at a place with a bar.

05:46.137 --> 05:48.806
Look, I think if it has food it’s
allowed to have a bar.

05:53.269 --> 05:55.146
Appreciate you guys taking me out.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.647
It’s been a rough week.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.193
Amy’s taking pilaaaates
from a guy named Guy.

06:00.568 --> 06:02.945
You’ve been surveilling your ex-wife?

06:02.945 --> 06:07.492
Oooweeee not with the restraining order!
I hired a Predator to follow her around.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.035
You can hire predators?

06:09.035 --> 06:11.287
Yeah, they’re cheap because they
live for the hunt,

06:11.287 --> 06:13.581
you just have
to pay ‘em to not kill your target

06:13.581 --> 06:16.375
and if they stay cloaked
there’s no licensing fee.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.045
Welcome to Fuck You’s!
My name is Mart, and...

06:19.378 --> 06:23.049
Fuck you! See, at Fuck You’s,
we lightly tease our customers.

06:23.382 --> 06:24.634
Oh, this is fun.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.094
What do you know, Gilligan?

06:26.427 --> 06:27.595
Nice.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.555
Look at this depressed pencil eraser.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.225
Did some middle schooler
stick you up a cat’s asshole?

06:32.558 --> 06:35.645
I bet you had everything and you
watched it slip through your powerless

06:35.645 --> 06:37.688
little fingers like the
sands of time.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.275
Be right back to take your order,
folks, or should I say, fucks.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.195
Perhaps this wasn’t the best place
to do this, Rick.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.488
What are you talkin’ about?

06:45.488 --> 06:48.741
This is a great place
to celebrate my birthday.

06:48.741 --> 06:55.331
Birthday, Birthday, Birthday...

06:55.331 --> 06:56.749
- Your birthday?
- Ooo weee.

06:56.749 --> 06:58.751
I can’t believe y’all remembered!

06:59.085 --> 07:03.339
I was at the end of my rope,
thinking I’d worn out all my welcomes.

07:03.673 --> 07:05.883
Thanks for doing all this, Rick.

07:05.883 --> 07:08.427
Of course, Mr. PB.
What are friends for.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.179
Heard we got a birthday boy.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.181
Yeah but... please don’t sing or...

07:12.682 --> 07:13.641
Yah! Fuck you, shithead!

07:15.476 --> 07:18.521
Haha yeah.
That sure is a smart hat...

07:18.521 --> 07:22.024
Because even my son
Poopy Jr.. hates me.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.945
I can relate.
Birddaughter is a total bitch.

07:26.487 --> 07:27.905
If you’re a parent you can say that.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.450
Well. Should we do shots?

07:31.909 --> 07:32.827
Rick?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.372
Let’S get Riggity, Riggity, wrecked!

07:36.372 --> 07:38.374
<i>I take a shot
Do a pop</i>

07:38.374 --> 07:39.625
<i>Blow a line
Huff turpentine</i>

07:39.625 --> 07:40.960
<i>Get wrecked
Text your ex</i>

07:40.960 --> 07:42.211
<i>Fight a cop
Feeling fine</i>

07:42.211 --> 07:43.379
<i>Punch your dick
Turn some tricks</i>

07:43.379 --> 07:44.630
<i>Quit your job
Buy a dog</i>

07:44.630 --> 07:45.923
<i>Have two beers
Then ten more</i>

07:45.923 --> 07:47.300
<i>Pop a pill
And meet the floor.</i>

07:50.761 --> 07:52.346
That one’s not my bellybutton.

07:53.055 --> 07:54.056
Well, what is it?

08:06.235 --> 08:07.320
Hold on, everyone!

08:10.740 --> 08:13.034
I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!

08:13.034 --> 08:14.243
Is there a restroom?

08:14.243 --> 08:15.244
At the front.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.010
Oh shit it’s happening.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.514
Honey rave! Bee time, baby.

08:35.348 --> 08:37.225
Whoa, what world is this?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.435
- We’re on Earth.
- How do you know?

08:39.435 --> 08:41.437
Because I think that is Hugh Jackman.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.609
Oh shit, it is.
Hey, Jackman!

08:47.276 --> 08:49.820
Makes sense he recognizes me,
we both hosted the Oscars.

08:49.820 --> 08:51.197
It’s a pretty exclusive club.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.908
Listen guys, don’t make this tacky,
nobody call him Wolverine,

08:53.908 --> 08:55.618
- just treat him like a regular...
- Gene!

08:55.952 --> 08:57.662
- Small world, mate!
- Hugh!

08:57.662 --> 08:58.955
Hugh married my cousin.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.166
Which I guess makes him
a Wolver-ine-law.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.377
That is fantastic!

09:05.002 --> 09:06.379
Didn’t you host the Oscars?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.214
- Yeah, I uh...
- Alright, Alright, listen.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.634
Now, I’m not assuming you guys want
to party with me tonight, but if you do.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.760
- Yes we do.
- Ooo wee.

09:12.760 --> 09:16.889
If you do, you do it together,
as a team.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.558
Now I need to go take what
I call a “Huge Ackman.”

09:19.558 --> 09:21.394
Ackman is Australian slang for shit.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.104
Don’t look it up. Do make a decision.

09:23.437 --> 09:25.731
Because from here,
I’m heading to the Jack Shack.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.609
- What’s the Jack Shack?
- It’s just his house.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.945
But guys.
I don’t think we should go there.

09:30.945 --> 09:34.740
I challenge you to explain why not
without making us want to go more.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.159
Well, Hugh’s pretty anti-limitation.

09:37.576 --> 09:40.413
When he parties, it gets... extreme.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.539
Challenge failed.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.499
Woah! What’s extreme by the Gene metric?

09:43.499 --> 09:45.126
Does he have Les Mis shot glasses?

09:45.126 --> 09:47.211
We’re not exactly squanchweights, brother.

09:47.211 --> 09:50.798
It’s my birthday and I wish
to party with Hugh Jackman.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.259
- Then you shall!
- That was a fast shit.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.261
But first everybody’s taking these.

09:55.261 --> 09:57.430
- What are they?
- Maybe they’re Tic-Tacs.

09:57.763 --> 09:58.889
Maybe they’re cyanide.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.642
Maybe I don’t like
to party with people that hesitate.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.645
There you go! That’s the spirit!

10:05.021 --> 10:08.357
Now we're all completely fun!

10:12.737 --> 10:15.281
This was not oversold!

10:15.281 --> 10:17.241
A, b, d, e...

10:17.575 --> 10:20.119
I lost my C.
My alphabet has no C.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.538
Did I do these already?
Did I ask that already?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.333
Squanch, yeah. My turn.

10:26.917 --> 10:27.835
Did I win?

10:31.505 --> 10:32.840
The best bloody day of my life.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.092
My wedding was pretty great too.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.802
I was talking about the Tony award.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.515
- Yes.
- We’re squanching now!

10:41.974 --> 10:44.518
- Why the long face, mate?
- Shape of my skull.

10:44.518 --> 10:45.728
You know, Mr. Poopybutthole,

10:45.728 --> 10:48.189
when I wrote Caribbean Queen,
you know what my agent said?

10:48.564 --> 10:50.566
- Billy Ocean wrote that...
- That’s what he said.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.318
Exactly that.
“Billy Ocean wrote this.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.819
Don’t write it again.
You’re not Billy Ocean.”

10:53.819 --> 10:55.654
You know what I did?
I fired my agent.

10:56.530 --> 10:59.367
Don’t accept other people’s limitations.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.328
What does your heart want, lil’ ripper?

11:02.703 --> 11:03.788
Right now, don’t think.

11:04.163 --> 11:07.208
Right now, my heart wants Amy back.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.293
Everybody!
Our friend wants Amy back.

11:09.293 --> 11:10.378
Squanch idea.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.380
I will agree to anything in this state.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.632
I do not think that’s a good idea.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.510
Ladies and Gentlemen!
This man is a fake friend.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.678
- Come on, Hugh.
-"Come on, Hugh."

11:19.678 --> 11:22.390
Come on, everybody.
Don’t call Hugh Jackman Wolverine.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.934
Don’t call yourself Billy Ocean.
Don’t get Amy Back.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.228
You’re a vampire, brother.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.938
You feed off other people’s energy.

11:28.938 --> 11:30.356
That is kind of true.

11:30.356 --> 11:33.359
Are you kidding me? You’ve been
living on my daughter’s sofa for months.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.028
- Do you want me to leave?
- The entire family does!

11:36.028 --> 11:38.656
- Why not say something?
- Because you’re my friend!

11:38.656 --> 11:41.784
A real friend would have
known it’s not my birthday.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.828
O shit.

11:44.245 --> 11:45.204
Fake friend!

11:45.204 --> 11:46.956
You’re not helping, Hugh Jackman.

11:46.956 --> 11:51.210
You do not tell me what to do.
Or Anyone Here.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.378
- Affirmative.
- Yeah, baby!

11:52.378 --> 11:54.380
Why would you pretend
it was your birthday?

11:54.380 --> 11:57.800
You think I don’t know a half-assed
intervention when I see one coming?

11:57.800 --> 11:59.176
O Shit.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.220
Love where you are, man.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.597
You’re just Wolverining right now.
You feel that?

12:03.597 --> 12:06.517
I think so.
Does Wolverining hurt a little?

12:06.517 --> 12:07.768
- Every time!
- Every time!

12:07.768 --> 12:09.395
Alright, grab a drink to go, gentlemen.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.147
Because we’re either getting Amy back.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.857
Or. We’re going home.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.067
- You’re nuts!
- Then nut me up, bitch!

12:15.526 --> 12:16.902
Nut me up!

12:17.445 --> 12:19.447
- Nut me up!
- Nut me up!

12:19.447 --> 12:20.531
It’s not an expression!

12:21.323 --> 12:23.367
Amy’S coming back dead or alive!

12:24.827 --> 12:25.744
Yes.

12:26.954 --> 12:29.498
Fake friend, my ass.
I know how to be there for my friends.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.419
Father? Why?

12:33.419 --> 12:36.172
Ah crap. Hang on. Lemme go upstairs
and grab the business finisher.

12:36.172 --> 12:40.259
From where I’m sitting, you’re the
one with unfinished business.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.886
Hey, mind your own business.

12:41.886 --> 12:46.474
Business is my business.
And brother, business is good.

12:52.813 --> 12:55.149
Oh, you come back to ruin our fun?

12:55.149 --> 12:56.775
No. To help you finish this.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.862
I made you guys come out because
I didn’t want to talk to PB alone.

13:00.362 --> 13:01.489
I’m here to go down with the ship.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.782
- Respect, Rick.
- Hit it, Hugh!

13:04.867 --> 13:08.954
<i>I lose my cool
when she steps in the room</i>

13:13.000 --> 13:16.921
<i>And I get so excited
just from her perfume</i>

13:16.921 --> 13:19.298
Weeeeooo, there she is. My Amy.

13:21.550 --> 13:22.927
<i>Electric eyes that you can't ignore...</i>

13:22.927 --> 13:25.638
Oh, she feels my love around her! Oowee!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.431
Wow. Your love is pretty strong.

13:29.892 --> 13:31.435
I guess that’s not all she’s feeling.

13:31.435 --> 13:35.523
Predator P.I.? This is the opposite
of what I hired you for!

13:35.856 --> 13:39.485
Now, now.
Did you do this, Gul’karna?

13:39.818 --> 13:42.696
<i>You do this? You do this?</i>

13:42.696 --> 13:44.031
<i>...running my game...</i>

13:44.031 --> 13:46.325
I’m gonna uncloak this later...

13:46.325 --> 13:48.077
<i>Now. Now.</i>

13:49.245 --> 13:51.497
Okay, honestly PB, that could have
gone a lot worse...

13:52.289 --> 13:53.207
Pb?

13:53.874 --> 13:55.501
<i>- Caribbean Queen...</i>
- Ooooweeee gotta goooo!

13:56.001 --> 13:56.919
Run!

13:59.421 --> 14:01.799
I’m too drunk to flee a Predator
right now.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.301
Mud. The mud thing.
Everyone mud up and hide!

14:06.053 --> 14:08.722
What’s that smell?
Squanchy, that’s not mud.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.140
Well, I’m not from this planet.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.725
Daddy, what’s happening?

14:11.725 --> 14:13.686
Quiet, Poopy Jr.
I’m taking you home.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.065
- Look, I just didn’t think I could...
- What? Be honest?

14:18.065 --> 14:19.858
Don’t high-road me.
It’s just as dishonest

14:19.858 --> 14:21.860
to play dumb about
wearing out your welcome!

14:21.860 --> 14:23.487
You could’ve just told me.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.447
You’re an adult! Read the room and
figure it out.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.511
I admit it, that was self destructive.

14:49.680 --> 14:52.433
Use me as a shield, I feel nothing!

14:55.269 --> 14:56.895
Squanch this.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.236
I’m so... I’m so squanched up, man.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.868
I’m not really with these guys,
I was just walking in this park...

15:12.953 --> 15:14.371
No!

15:14.997 --> 15:16.415
Why is this my thing?

15:16.415 --> 15:19.001
No! I won’t let you take
my family from me.

15:28.677 --> 15:31.722
Guess you didn’t see season 4,
episode 3.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.723
Let’s Go!

15:34.266 --> 15:35.100
Fuck.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.313
Who’s got the three dots on their
forehead now?

15:39.313 --> 15:41.398
Could have done that
before he punched me.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.319
Suck my squanch!

15:51.075 --> 15:52.451
Gimme that big ol’ tooth!

15:52.451 --> 15:54.453
Gul’karna...

16:00.626 --> 16:01.919
No, no, stop!

16:01.919 --> 16:03.837
What are you doing?
I want that skull!

16:03.837 --> 16:07.424
No, Rick. No more.
This is my fault. All of it.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.885
And... if he’s gonna protect
my wife and chiiild,

16:10.344 --> 16:13.138
that’s a great thing to know
while I get my shit together.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.223
Wayne?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.933
- Wayne?
- Amy.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.060
I messed up real baaad,

16:18.602 --> 16:21.397
I came to say I don’t know
what to do without you, but...

16:21.397 --> 16:23.899
I guess I can start by not kidnapping.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.694
That’s definitely where you should start.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.117
I’m... sorry, Amy.

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
You should be. But I’m not.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.954
We’re a family now.

16:36.954 --> 16:42.126
Me, Poopy Jr., and Gul’Karna,
Clan Leader of The Skin'Thieves.

16:42.543 --> 16:43.669
Goodbye, Wayne.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.170
Goodbye.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.340
Ooo-weee, a musket?

16:48.340 --> 16:50.342
I’m starting to think it’s like
their currency...

16:50.926 --> 16:56.348
<i>I hunt because I must. But man possesses
a precious gift; the power to change.</i>

16:57.057 --> 16:59.101
More like the power of music, bitch!

16:59.101 --> 17:00.227
What the fuck?

17:00.227 --> 17:02.271
Jesus, Hugh, we were just resolving it.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.148
Well, I’m an actor and I’m high.

17:04.606 --> 17:07.818
“Caribbean Queen, written by Hugh
Jackman, age sixteen.”

17:07.818 --> 17:09.028
How’s that for a twist?

17:09.737 --> 17:10.738
Confusing.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.531
Well. Sometimes you have to believe.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.826
Wow, that’s reeeal inspiring.
Makes me think of how...

17:15.826 --> 17:18.871
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay, okay, sorry.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.873
lright guys,
I’m buying drive through tacos,

17:20.873 --> 17:23.542
but nobody tells my nutritionist
and we have to steal a car.

17:25.878 --> 17:26.879
Wayne’ huh?

17:26.879 --> 17:31.884
Oooweee. But I prefer Mr.
Popybutthole. More refined.

17:34.052 --> 17:37.598
It appears Birddaughter has broken
into another Federation compound.

17:37.931 --> 17:39.057
I must go.

17:39.057 --> 17:41.602
Wayne, this counts as attending
your actual birthday.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.396
Rick. It was... canonical to see you.

17:44.772 --> 17:45.731
Yeah, let’s call it.

17:46.148 --> 17:48.442
I wanna pass out before
I remember what we did tonight.

17:48.942 --> 17:52.488
I never want to forget it.
And I never want to repeat it.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.072
Proud of you, little buddy.

17:55.324 --> 17:56.366
You too, Squanch.

17:56.825 --> 18:00.788
Fuck. Look at us.
A bird guy, talking cat,

18:01.330 --> 18:03.874
what are you?
A robot man, and a mutant.

18:03.874 --> 18:07.127
Was a bonzer night, mates.
That’s one for the books.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.588
<i>Bonzer night indeed.</i>

18:09.963 --> 18:12.257
<i>Kept in touch
with the guys over the years.</i>

18:12.257 --> 18:14.760
<i>As much as ya can in this fast world.</i>

18:15.135 --> 18:17.262
<i>Birdperson went home
to take on a challenge</i>

18:17.262 --> 18:19.598
<i>way more difficult than a Predator...</i>

18:19.932 --> 18:21.517
<i>raising Birddaughter.</i>

18:22.017 --> 18:25.813
<i>Gearhead went back to The Gear System
and got a spinal replacement.</i>

18:26.313 --> 18:27.773
<i>He’s still paying it off.</i>

18:28.190 --> 18:31.485
<i>Squanchy?
Checked himself into a nice rehab.</i>

18:31.860 --> 18:34.321
<i>No one thought it would
stick and it didn’t.</i>

18:34.321 --> 18:37.866
<i>He was later arrested for smuggling
toad venom across the border.</i>

18:38.242 --> 18:40.035
<i>to glue Hugh Jackman
went to the Jack Shack</i>

18:40.035 --> 18:42.996
<i>back together the Tony
award that Gene shot.</i>

18:43.330 --> 18:47.125
<i>And possibly to put a bullet
in all future Wolverine references.</i>

18:47.125 --> 18:48.293
<i>Thanks to us.</i>

18:48.293 --> 18:51.547
<i>And what came of Rick?
I think he learned something that night.</i>

18:51.880 --> 18:54.341
<i>About friendship. About honesty.</i>

18:54.675 --> 18:58.053
<i>And maybe he learned
something about himseelllf.</i>

18:59.054 --> 19:02.850
Here. Forgot to give you a fading pill.
Great for hangovers.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.144
Just to clarify, I had to take
an un-fading pill to counteract

19:06.562 --> 19:07.938
the original fading pill I just took.

19:08.355 --> 19:10.315
Okay?

19:10.315 --> 19:12.150
And if you’re hung up on why the
taxi disappeared,

19:12.150 --> 19:15.153
the pills aren’t sentient,
but they do detect human coverings,

19:15.153 --> 19:17.781
so it saw the taxi as some sort
of large overcoat.

19:18.407 --> 19:19.324
Doesn’t matter.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.076
You uh, gonna be alright?

19:21.618 --> 19:22.619
Got a place to stay?

19:23.245 --> 19:25.122
I can 3D print you
an apartment on the moon.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.499
I’ll figure it out, Rick. Thanks.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.710
Well, here I go pill’in again.

19:32.087 --> 19:36.216
Yep. Don’t any of you worry about
Mr. Popybutthole.

19:36.717 --> 19:39.887
I got a lot of work to do,
but I’ll land on my poopy little feet.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.471
I always do.

19:43.307 --> 19:46.351
This burns like hell.
How did the other guys not react?

19:46.351 --> 19:49.813
Is mine different?
It’s like my skin is boiling!

19:50.606 --> 19:53.025
Guys, I got the Best Buds Burrito Box.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.860
They normally ask
for proof of friendship,

19:54.860 --> 19:56.987
but the cashier trusted
me that you guys were out...

19:58.697 --> 19:59.615
...here.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.284
Not cool, man.

20:41.698 --> 20:45.202
You don’t have to do this, Sheriff.
It’s your last day on the job.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.956
That’s exactly why I must.
I ain’t retiring a coward.

20:49.498 --> 20:50.916
Get out of here, officer.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.377
And go take care of my granddaughter.

21:26.785 --> 21:33.291
<i>When I was young and in my prime,
my mind being free from care.</i>

21:33.709 --> 21:35.293
I ain’t scared of you!

21:36.003 --> 21:39.172
<i>Whilst leaving all in Donegal.</i>

21:39.715 --> 21:44.177
<i>That i might, plough,
the raging main,</i>

21:44.886 --> 21:47.472
<i>going to amerikay...</i>

22:01.528 --> 22:02.446
What happened?

22:02.904 --> 22:04.406
I think it ran out of gas.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.161
So, he could have survived
if he just stood back five feet?

22:10.370 --> 22:13.206
Well. Let’s not tell
his granddaughter that.
