<i>Clear and holster your safe weapon.</i>

00:14.424 --> 00:16.924
When your weapon is safe,
raise your hand.

00:18.828 --> 00:21.562
<i>The line is safe.
Remove your eyes and ears.</i>

00:21.631 --> 00:24.231
Bring your targets up-range.
Watch your heads.

00:27.469 --> 00:29.096
Police your brass.

00:29.182 --> 00:31.885
Bring your targets up
for requalification.

00:36.746 --> 00:38.846
You can frame this if you want,

00:38.915 --> 00:41.248
you know, for younger
generations to marvel.

00:42.618 --> 00:44.952
- Detective Lindsay, right?
- Yeah.

00:45.021 --> 00:47.355
- From Intelligence?
- Yeah.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.341
You got a new guy, Kenny Rixton?

00:50.410 --> 00:52.510
Yeah.

00:52.578 --> 00:54.245
Watch your back.

00:55.615 --> 00:56.940
We got to roll. How'd you do?

00:59.352 --> 01:00.851
Son of a bitch.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.287
Congratulations.

01:03.356 --> 01:04.754
You both passed re-qual.

01:04.824 --> 01:07.591
- Stay safe out there.
- Thank you.

01:07.660 --> 01:10.861
- Um...
- Erin, we gotta go.

01:35.988 --> 01:36.999
- But it's all we have.
- Thanks.

01:37.023 --> 01:38.023
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

01:38.057 --> 01:39.490
Body inside the house.

01:39.559 --> 01:40.925
Or, you know, what's left of it.

01:40.993 --> 01:43.928
Reynolds is the LGBT home next door.

01:43.996 --> 01:47.431
- LGBT stands for Lesbian...
- I know what it stands for.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.300
Okay. Everyone in there was evacuated

01:49.368 --> 01:52.002
to the school basement,
which is down the block.

01:52.071 --> 01:54.538
- Okay. Thanks.
- Yeah.

02:02.315 --> 02:04.248
- Sergeant.
- Randy.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.485
Another day at the office?

02:07.553 --> 02:11.288
Yeah. These natural gas
explosions are no joke.

02:11.357 --> 02:13.457
I've seen one take out
half a city block.

02:13.526 --> 02:15.993
Any indication how it happened?

02:16.062 --> 02:18.996
Gas flex hose was removed
from the kitchen wall,

02:19.065 --> 02:22.166
so looking like this was intentional.

02:28.975 --> 02:30.307
Okay, so what did Rixton do?

02:30.376 --> 02:32.076
Guy didn't say.

02:33.379 --> 02:34.545
What? They got to know.

02:34.614 --> 02:36.781
Where's Rixton now?

02:36.849 --> 02:39.016
He's in the back of the house.

02:39.085 --> 02:41.685
Guys, I'm just saying
let's not go on the warpath

02:41.754 --> 02:44.369
until we know what happened,
if anything.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.341
You're right.

02:51.714 --> 02:55.266
Paint thinner. Could be the accelerant.

02:55.334 --> 02:58.536
CFD says there were two more
like it in the basement.

02:58.604 --> 03:00.388
Your guys at the gang unit must be proud

03:00.440 --> 03:03.541
with you making the jump
over to Intelligence.

03:03.609 --> 03:05.309
Yeah. Yeah, they are.

03:05.378 --> 03:06.777
Why?

03:09.982 --> 03:12.016
Hey! Hey! Over here!

03:16.322 --> 03:18.756
- He's alive!
- Medics, trauma victim.

03:18.825 --> 03:21.992
Delta side in the gangway.
Board, collar, jump bag, now!

03:22.061 --> 03:23.728
<i>- Copy that.
- Okay, ready?</i>

03:23.796 --> 03:25.796
Lift! You're gonna be okay.

03:25.865 --> 03:27.598
Help's on the way. Just hang on.

03:29.635 --> 03:30.901
Just hang on.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.636
All right, the tenant
is Dan Llewellyn, 35.

03:40.722 --> 03:41.810
He's a contractor.

03:41.897 --> 03:43.330
Now, we didn't find a cell phone

03:43.399 --> 03:45.399
anywhere on the body or on the property.

03:45.467 --> 03:47.734
All calls to Llewellyn's cell
have gone unanswered,

03:47.803 --> 03:49.569
and we can't get a signal location.

03:49.638 --> 03:51.004
We've reached out to his family.

03:51.073 --> 03:52.606
Body's at the M.E.'s office right now.

03:52.675 --> 03:54.708
They're trying to track
for dental and DNA.

03:54.777 --> 03:57.344
Preliminary report says
we got a male, 6'2 ", maybe 6'3."

03:57.413 --> 03:58.490
That matches Llewellyn's height.

03:58.514 --> 03:59.724
All right, and the other victim?

03:59.748 --> 04:01.415
Was he from that LGBT home?

04:01.483 --> 04:03.283
Yeah, he's at Med.
I'm trying to get an ID,

04:03.352 --> 04:05.919
but the home's director says all
their kids are accounted for.

04:05.988 --> 04:08.028
All right, Atwater,
you and Rixton head over to Med.

04:08.057 --> 04:09.890
I want you there
when he's ready to talk.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.458
And have his clothes sent to the lab.

04:11.527 --> 04:12.771
Have them checked for accelerant.

04:12.795 --> 04:13.894
He may be our firebug.

04:13.962 --> 04:16.630
CFD says we're not looking
at a trained arsonist.

04:16.699 --> 04:18.632
All right, the rest of you...
fire's an easy way

04:18.701 --> 04:21.034
to execute a homicide or cover one up.

04:21.103 --> 04:22.269
Let's figure out which

04:22.593 --> 04:25.428
and why we got two bodies at the
same place at the same time.

04:25.507 --> 04:27.107
What do we have on the building's owner?

04:27.709 --> 04:30.381
Fred Teague. He's got six
properties on the south side,

04:30.467 --> 04:32.357
and he's been dancing on and off
with the city's.

04:32.381 --> 04:34.181
Troubled Building Unit
for the last few years.

04:34.249 --> 04:36.082
Copy that. And he's downstairs.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.584
Hit it.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.152
Okay.

04:41.023 --> 04:43.123
That's convenient.

04:49.231 --> 04:51.198
Talked to a guy who I trust.

04:51.266 --> 04:53.433
He said indictments are
being handed down

04:53.502 --> 04:54.434
to Rixton's old unit.

04:54.503 --> 04:55.769
Seriously? For what?

04:55.838 --> 04:58.238
I don't know. He didn't say.

04:58.307 --> 05:00.874
So, what? Rixton bailed
on a sinking ship?

05:00.943 --> 05:02.876
Yeah, or Voigt threw him
a life preserver.

05:04.079 --> 05:06.379
I mean, what are we all supposed to do?

05:06.448 --> 05:08.582
Just wait around for IAD to handle it?

05:08.650 --> 05:11.885
'Cause I figure
if his old unit is bent,

05:11.954 --> 05:13.119
what kind of cop is he?

05:13.188 --> 05:14.955
What do we even know about this guy,

05:15.023 --> 05:17.903
aside from the fact
that Voigt rubber-stamped him?

05:18.971 --> 05:21.238
I'm gonna call Antonio.

05:21.341 --> 05:22.841
I mean, if indictments are coming down,

05:22.865 --> 05:24.698
- he's gonna know about them.
- Yeah.

05:28.904 --> 05:30.971
I just came from the house.

05:31.039 --> 05:33.473
That was the first rental
I bought, 18 years ago.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.542
Can you believe that?

05:34.617 --> 05:37.043
What was your relationship
like with the tenant,

05:37.112 --> 05:38.148
Dan Llewellyn?

05:38.314 --> 05:39.613
Frosty.

05:39.682 --> 05:42.783
I mean, rest his soul, but...

05:42.960 --> 05:45.361
what a royal pain in the ass.

05:45.461 --> 05:46.660
How so?

05:46.754 --> 05:48.422
Dan was looking to break his lease,

05:48.490 --> 05:50.457
move in with his girlfriend.

05:50.526 --> 05:51.959
But he had eight months left.

05:52.027 --> 05:54.861
- What was her name?
- Vivica something.

05:54.930 --> 05:56.908
You got a couple of properties
with code violations.

05:56.932 --> 05:58.229
I fixed all those.

05:58.315 --> 06:01.535
And the house from this morning
was 100% up to code.

06:01.604 --> 06:04.338
Yeah, except you took out extra
insurance on it two months ago.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.839
I was doing work on the building,

06:05.908 --> 06:07.941
and the extra insurance is

06:08.010 --> 06:09.977
because there was gonna be
people on site.

06:10.045 --> 06:12.646
All right, so where were you
this morning, Mr. Teague?

06:12.715 --> 06:15.916
I had a meeting
with a painter across town.

06:20.389 --> 06:23.557
Are you guys seriously looking
at me for torching my own place?

06:23.626 --> 06:26.493
You're not talking us out of it.

06:26.562 --> 06:28.362
Maybe Dan lit the place

06:28.430 --> 06:30.275
so he didn't have to pay rent
the rest of the year,

06:30.299 --> 06:32.299
and he torched his own ass
in the process.

06:32.368 --> 06:33.934
Maybe.

06:35.504 --> 06:37.804
Name and number of the painter you met.

06:40.676 --> 06:43.744
Dan will screw me yet from the grave.

06:43.812 --> 06:45.479
He'll screw me.

06:48.917 --> 06:50.672
Sarge.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.053
We got a homeless guy
ranting and raving outside.

06:53.122 --> 06:54.430
So get rid of him.

06:54.649 --> 06:57.557
Yeah, love to, but CPD's
new de-escalation protocol

06:57.626 --> 07:00.594
means I got to contact
my immediate supervisor ASAP,

07:00.663 --> 07:03.330
so... it is what it is.

07:06.602 --> 07:09.036
It's about my dog.
She's been gone all this time.

07:09.104 --> 07:10.949
And no one can find her.

07:11.043 --> 07:12.939
And I looked. I did. I did.

07:13.008 --> 07:15.074
And so... so what help are you?

07:15.136 --> 07:18.045
What I'm asking... right? Right?
'Cause Jupiter... Jupiter...

07:18.113 --> 07:19.546
That's what planet he's on.

07:19.615 --> 07:20.914
You have a dog missing, sir?

07:20.983 --> 07:22.949
Dog. My dog. Thank you.

07:23.018 --> 07:25.619
Why is no one looking?
Looking? 'Cause Jupiter...

07:25.688 --> 07:27.754
H-his name is Jupiter?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.523
Marvin. My name's Marvin.

07:29.591 --> 07:31.758
Okay, Marvin, we're gonna
walk inside where it's warm,

07:31.827 --> 07:33.138
and we're gonna get you
something to eat,

07:33.162 --> 07:34.895
and maybe make a few calls...!

07:36.365 --> 07:38.732
What's in your pocket, Marvin?

07:38.801 --> 07:42.369
Look at me.
Marvin, what's in your pocket?

07:42.438 --> 07:44.104
Needle.

07:44.173 --> 07:46.773
What's in the needle, Marvin?
Are you shooting up?

07:46.842 --> 07:48.809
My dog is gone.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.717
You didn't pat him down?
You didn't search him?

07:50.779 --> 07:52.657
- What are you, a rookie?
- No, no, he comes up and I...

07:52.681 --> 07:54.915
Tell Commander Crowley
I'll have an Exposure Report

07:54.983 --> 07:56.316
when I get back from Med.

07:56.385 --> 07:57.617
But get him inside,

07:57.686 --> 07:58.952
search him properly,

07:59.021 --> 08:01.455
and get his info.

08:01.523 --> 08:02.789
All right, come on.

08:04.493 --> 08:06.827
We just finished unpacking last night.

08:06.895 --> 08:09.096
Why do you want to know about Dan?

08:09.164 --> 08:10.270
Have you spoken to him today?

08:10.294 --> 08:12.966
Not since this morning.
He left at, like, 5:30.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.469
Do you know where his job was
or the name of his firm?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.804
He's self-employed. He's
doing a remodel across town,

08:17.873 --> 08:18.983
but I don't have the address.

08:19.007 --> 08:20.474
What's going on?

08:20.542 --> 08:23.610
Vivica, there was a fire
at his old place

08:23.679 --> 08:26.613
early this morning,
and somebody got caught in it.

08:26.682 --> 08:28.148
Someone died?

08:30.119 --> 08:32.018
My God. Was it Dan?

08:32.087 --> 08:32.938
We don't know yet.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.421
How can you not know?

08:34.490 --> 08:36.640
The condition of the body.

08:41.047 --> 08:44.097
That's him. He was wearing
a blue shirt, grey sweater.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.633
He's tall. Like 6'3".

08:46.702 --> 08:48.802
No. No.

08:48.871 --> 08:50.137
No. Where's the body?

08:50.205 --> 08:52.584
- At the medical examiner's.
- I'll go. I'll know if I look...

08:52.608 --> 08:55.142
You don't want to see the body, ma'am.

08:59.782 --> 09:01.381
Patient's name is Kyle Harvey.

09:01.450 --> 09:03.850
Dr. Rhodes is coming down.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.719
- Great. Thank you.
- Appreciate that.

09:05.788 --> 09:08.293
So, dog,

09:08.371 --> 09:10.988
you still keep up with buddies
from your old unit?

09:12.082 --> 09:16.496
Why is everyone suddenly
so interested in my old unit?

09:16.565 --> 09:17.859
I'ma keep it real with you, man.

09:17.983 --> 09:20.578
We heard about some
indictments coming down, and...

09:21.347 --> 09:23.113
I just want a little clarification.

09:23.472 --> 09:25.216
Yeah, well, you know,
you're not an active cop

09:25.240 --> 09:27.029
unless you got a beef on you.

09:27.115 --> 09:30.477
Yeah, well, indictment's a little
different from beef, but okay.

09:30.546 --> 09:31.546
Hey, fellas.

09:31.764 --> 09:33.914
So, I'm sorry, but your victim
was triple zeroes

09:33.982 --> 09:34.848
when he came in.

09:34.961 --> 09:36.944
We did everything we could, but he died

09:37.012 --> 09:39.390
of massive blunt force trauma
from the explosion.

09:39.492 --> 09:41.369
Thanks, Doc. Think you could
send those clothes

09:41.431 --> 09:42.431
to the lab for us?

09:42.472 --> 09:43.971
- You got it.
- Thanks.

09:46.829 --> 09:48.428
Did you know Kyle?

09:48.497 --> 09:51.565
I'm Angie McCallister, from Reynolds,

09:51.633 --> 09:53.600
the LGBT home next door.

09:53.669 --> 09:55.902
Kyle was one of ours.

10:01.243 --> 10:04.945
Kyle was released two weeks ago.

10:05.013 --> 10:07.113
His mother passed away a year ago.

10:07.182 --> 10:09.082
He and his father were always at odds.

10:09.151 --> 10:11.184
Six months ago,
he tried to take his own life,

10:11.253 --> 10:13.587
and he was placed with us.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.255
We'd been working with Kyle and his dad.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.437
They'd come so far.

10:18.527 --> 10:22.963
Yeah. Um, did you have any
issue with the tenant next door?

10:23.031 --> 10:25.165
Dan? No.

10:25.234 --> 10:27.467
He was a great guy.

10:27.536 --> 10:30.537
He fixed things around the house.

10:30.606 --> 10:32.139
He was really nice to the kids.

10:32.207 --> 10:36.176
And some people in the neighborhood
just weren't as welcoming, you know?

10:36.245 --> 10:39.379
He stood up for our kids.

10:39.448 --> 10:43.550
Did he stand up to anybody
in particular?

10:43.619 --> 10:46.553
One guy, yeah.

10:46.622 --> 10:50.760
Like, two weeks ago,
he and Dan got into a fight.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.307
The M.E. says no dental work

10:55.369 --> 10:56.863
or recent surgeries on our victim.

10:56.932 --> 10:59.213
Canvass says it may have happened
too early for witnesses.

10:59.256 --> 11:02.836
No neighbors saw or heard
anything until the explosion.

11:02.905 --> 11:05.005
Hey, Sarge, um,

11:05.073 --> 11:08.074
we gotta ask you about Rixton.

11:08.143 --> 11:09.643
What about him?

11:09.711 --> 11:13.046
We heard that indictments were
being handed down in his old unit.

11:13.115 --> 11:15.982
What does that have to do with you?

11:19.922 --> 11:21.988
I want to know who's got my back.

11:22.057 --> 11:25.859
Jeez. I imagine Kenny'd like
to know who has his as well.

11:25.928 --> 11:28.139
You'd think that impending
indictments would be something

11:28.163 --> 11:29.763
that he might, you know, offer up to us.

11:29.798 --> 11:30.931
I know I would.

11:31.202 --> 11:34.067
So you question a guy that I
brought in and vouched for

11:34.381 --> 11:36.436
instead of working a case
that killed two people?

11:36.505 --> 11:38.491
I can do both
at the same time. Trust me.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.242
Dan Llewellyn stood up
for a few gay teens

11:42.311 --> 11:43.743
a week and a half ago...

11:43.812 --> 11:46.450
Punched a grown bully who was
threatening them. Harlan Betts.

11:46.489 --> 11:49.083
Betts left, but pissed.

11:49.284 --> 11:51.114
You and Erin.

12:01.897 --> 12:04.764
The guy punched me,
and I'm the one in hot water?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.002
Why don't you go arrest him?

12:06.088 --> 12:08.969
Maybe because you're the one
that likes to taunt teenagers.

12:09.037 --> 12:10.166
Does that make you feel tough?

12:10.190 --> 12:12.639
I got a kid, okay?
She looks out the window,

12:12.708 --> 12:14.574
sees two guys kissing.

12:14.643 --> 12:16.276
What kind of example is that?

12:16.345 --> 12:19.813
What kind of example is it
you attacking them?

12:19.882 --> 12:21.081
I didn't attack anyone.

12:21.149 --> 12:24.050
<i>He hit me. Why am I here?</i>

12:24.119 --> 12:27.988
Because somebody set his house
on fire with him in it.

12:30.192 --> 12:32.292
I'm sorry. Do you find that funny?

12:32.361 --> 12:35.595
Karma's a bitch?

12:35.664 --> 12:37.731
Two people were killed in that blast,

12:37.799 --> 12:39.697
and one of them was a teenager
from Reynolds, so what happened?

12:39.721 --> 12:41.090
Did he kiss another kid in front of you?

12:41.114 --> 12:42.947
You decided to teach him a lesson?

12:43.289 --> 12:44.455
Nope.

12:48.844 --> 12:50.111
I'm warning you:

12:50.214 --> 12:52.647
Lose the grin,
or I will lose it for you.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.153
You're gonna want to see this.

13:08.951 --> 13:10.267
Hit it.

13:10.532 --> 13:13.133
Dan Llewellyn, tenant from 3507 Wallace.

13:13.201 --> 13:14.935
He's alive. He's okay.

13:15.979 --> 13:19.039
Then... who the hell died in that fire?

13:28.407 --> 13:30.320
Did I hear right
that someone from next door

13:30.398 --> 13:31.398
got killed in the blast?

13:31.492 --> 13:33.648
- That is right.
- Who?

13:34.038 --> 13:35.805
His name was Kyle Harvey.

13:35.874 --> 13:38.040
- Man.
- So you knew him?

13:38.109 --> 13:40.443
Yeah. He was trying to patch
things up with his dad.

13:40.512 --> 13:42.211
How well did you know him?

13:42.280 --> 13:45.314
He'd come around sometimes. We'd talk.

13:45.383 --> 13:47.094
When's the last time
you were at the house, Dan?

13:47.118 --> 13:49.352
A week and a half ago. I took everything

13:49.421 --> 13:51.655
but the heavy stuff
I was gonna sell online.

13:51.803 --> 13:54.084
Can you think of anyone
who might've had it out for you?

13:54.211 --> 13:55.677
Yeah. The landlord.

13:55.794 --> 13:56.993
Well, he alibied out.

13:57.119 --> 13:59.407
Yeah, well, maybe he hired one
of his illegal immigrant workers

13:59.431 --> 14:00.807
he pays 2 bucks an hour.

14:00.885 --> 14:01.931
That could be.

14:02.010 --> 14:03.713
All right, Dan,
I'm gonna posit a scenario

14:03.791 --> 14:07.127
that any objective person
would eventually arrive at.

14:07.272 --> 14:08.971
Torching the place is one way

14:09.040 --> 14:10.920
of getting out of paying
the rest of your lease.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.976
Yeah, it is. But that's not my style.

14:14.045 --> 14:15.990
I already reached out to a buddy
of mine getting into real estate

14:16.014 --> 14:17.947
to see if he could find me a subletter.

14:18.016 --> 14:21.050
- His name?
- Corey Kipton. He teaches yoga

14:21.119 --> 14:23.453
until the real estate thing
kicks in full-time.

14:23.521 --> 14:25.722
So where were you this morning?

14:25.790 --> 14:28.424
On this new job. I was working
in a basement all morning.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.061
Walked out to grab a smoke,
and my phone lit up

14:31.139 --> 14:32.762
with messages and missed calls.

14:32.831 --> 14:34.928
Anybody confirm that?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.000
Me.

14:38.069 --> 14:39.969
You know, Kyle wasn't staying
at Reynolds House.

14:40.038 --> 14:42.004
Why do you think he came back?

14:42.073 --> 14:43.840
- What are you implying?
- Nothin'.

14:43.908 --> 14:45.842
'Cause he was gay...

14:45.910 --> 14:47.888
you implying me and Kyle
had a sexual relationship?

14:47.912 --> 14:49.078
- Did ya?
- No.

14:49.147 --> 14:50.621
Okay.

14:50.683 --> 14:52.308
What difference would it make if we did?

14:52.402 --> 14:54.502
I'm just trying to figure out
what's goin' on.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.491
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

15:01.559 --> 15:03.693
Just having a conversation.

15:03.762 --> 15:06.095
Well, the conversation's over.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.102
Jay.

15:15.568 --> 15:17.646
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

15:17.740 --> 15:18.886
People are starting to whisper

15:18.910 --> 15:21.310
about what went down in the gang unit.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.826
Don't say a word.

15:22.912 --> 15:24.779
I wouldn't mind coming clean.

15:24.949 --> 15:28.351
Keep your head in the case.
Don't say a word.

15:34.325 --> 15:36.085
What the hell?
They won't buzz me up anymore?

15:36.127 --> 15:38.060
Well, we told them
to keep the riffraff out.

15:41.499 --> 15:44.200
- So?
- Whole thing's sealed up tight.

15:44.269 --> 15:46.369
And I'm not on that case.

15:46.438 --> 15:48.070
But you must have heard something.

15:48.139 --> 15:49.906
Antonio, come on.

15:49.974 --> 15:52.108
We have to work with this guy now.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.511
I heard seven indictments
are coming down.

15:55.993 --> 15:57.960
Rixton was in an eight-man unit.

15:58.052 --> 15:59.418
That's right.

16:00.679 --> 16:03.147
So is Rixton the one
not getting indicted?

16:03.215 --> 16:04.343
Correct.

16:04.585 --> 16:07.023
If he wasn't rounded up,
maybe he didn't do anything.

16:08.588 --> 16:10.987
Or he's walking because he
rolled on his entire team.

16:11.401 --> 16:13.162
That's not my department.

16:14.732 --> 16:18.770
Man... you miss us, though, right?

16:20.905 --> 16:23.406
I cry myself to sleep every night.

16:23.475 --> 16:25.174
Figured.

16:26.911 --> 16:29.779
We ran the man's name
with area hospitals.

16:29.848 --> 16:33.950
The VA has him confirmed
with hepatitis C.

16:34.018 --> 16:36.285
O-okay.

16:36.354 --> 16:38.855
They're sending his full record now.

16:38.923 --> 16:40.897
And we'll also check for HIV,

16:40.975 --> 16:42.925
but that's just precautionary.

16:43.181 --> 16:46.584
I mean, I barely got pricked.

16:47.077 --> 16:48.898
We'll keep a good thought, all right?

16:48.967 --> 16:50.199
Thanks.

16:57.442 --> 16:59.508
Yeah, I've been studying
for my real estate license,

16:59.577 --> 17:01.510
so renting houses
and apartments part-time.

17:01.579 --> 17:04.180
"Show the place to anybody 6'3" or so?

17:04.248 --> 17:06.015
Yeah, a guy walked in yesterday.

17:06.084 --> 17:07.516
Does he have a name?

17:07.585 --> 17:09.351
I think it was Bill something.

17:09.420 --> 17:13.255
Couple of first names. John...
Bill Johns?

17:13.324 --> 17:15.868
Anyway, he and his wife said they
wanted to move to the south side.

17:15.893 --> 17:17.133
He wanted the house right then.

17:17.156 --> 17:18.242
Said he loved the red door.

17:18.308 --> 17:20.208
Hey, how about a copy
of that application?

17:20.698 --> 17:23.232
He offered me a thousand bucks
cash to hold the place.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.901
Well, you should at least have
a phone number, right?

17:25.970 --> 17:28.436
No. He said he was gonna call me today.

17:28.506 --> 17:32.107
Does anybody else besides you
and Dan have a key to the place?

17:32.176 --> 17:34.376
No idea. I just use the key

17:34.445 --> 17:36.445
that Dan leaves under
the planter by the back door.

17:36.514 --> 17:38.647
Did this Bill Johns
see where that key is hidden?

17:38.716 --> 17:41.584
Maybe. Probably.

17:41.652 --> 17:42.751
We good?

17:42.820 --> 17:44.220
Yeah.

17:46.324 --> 17:48.490
Your victim didn't die
from smoke inhalation

17:48.559 --> 17:50.459
or blunt force trauma.

17:50.528 --> 17:52.428
He was shot first.

17:52.496 --> 17:55.464
A .22 fired into the eye socket
at close range.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.900
- Okay.
- Any marks to help us ID him?

17:57.969 --> 18:00.669
Too far gone for birthmarks or tattoos.

18:00.738 --> 18:02.538
But I do have a wedding ring.

18:03.774 --> 18:05.975
Congrats on moving up to Intelligence.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.509
I've been meaning to tell you that.

18:07.578 --> 18:08.614
Thank you.

18:08.638 --> 18:11.224
And that super nice guy
you were engaged to, Adam Ruzek?

18:11.286 --> 18:12.708
Is he still there?

18:12.837 --> 18:16.238
No. He's... no.

18:16.520 --> 18:19.755
Because of you?

18:19.824 --> 18:22.358
- Can we move on?
- Of course.

18:22.426 --> 18:23.626
Great.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.294
No inscription,

18:25.363 --> 18:27.763
nothing out of the ordinary to track it.

18:27.832 --> 18:30.299
And his watch.

18:30.368 --> 18:31.700
Victim fell on his arm.

18:31.769 --> 18:33.502
It wouldn't have survived otherwise.

18:33.571 --> 18:36.305
Breguet, vintage.
I have a reference number,

18:36.374 --> 18:38.374
movement serial number, and case number.

18:38.442 --> 18:42.645
18 jewels, high-quality
manual wind mechanism.

18:42.713 --> 18:45.335
Sorry. My second husband was obsessed.

18:47.318 --> 18:49.648
Shame about the fire. This was a beauty.

18:49.673 --> 18:50.709
You sold it?

18:50.734 --> 18:52.018
I checked my records after your call.

18:52.042 --> 18:53.322
Sold it a year and a half ago.

18:53.391 --> 18:55.219
To a Bill Johns? William Johns?

18:55.309 --> 18:58.208
No. A Jane Framingham?

19:00.147 --> 19:01.981
And this watch is 12 grand?

19:02.049 --> 19:04.283
It's a deal for what she got.
Mint condition,

19:04.352 --> 19:06.352
authenticated original box
and service papers.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.787
It was an anniversary gift.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.489
She say anything about the husband?

19:10.558 --> 19:13.292
No. Did she kill him?

19:13.361 --> 19:14.994
Did she say she was gonna kill him?

19:15.062 --> 19:16.862
God, no. Don't mind me.

19:16.931 --> 19:18.664
I read too many thrillers.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.683
This is the most excitement
I've had all year.

19:23.471 --> 19:26.305
Mrs. Framingham, we found the watch

19:26.374 --> 19:28.274
on a body earlier this morning.

19:28.342 --> 19:30.476
The man died in a house fire.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.544
In New York?

19:33.180 --> 19:34.830
My husband's travelling there
on business.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.832
Is... is that where this happened?

19:36.901 --> 19:39.034
The south side of Chicago.

19:39.103 --> 19:41.553
We believe the man's name
was Bill Johns.

19:41.622 --> 19:44.229
He was wearing this watch
and a wedding ring.

19:46.494 --> 19:48.727
I don't understand.
Why would a dead man in Chicago

19:48.796 --> 19:50.955
be wearing my husband's watch and ring?

19:57.121 --> 19:59.540
Curt and I talked
on the phone last night.

20:00.541 --> 20:02.085
He calls every night
when he's travelling.

20:02.109 --> 20:04.376
- He called you from New York?
- Yes.

20:04.445 --> 20:07.012
I mean, that's where he said he was.

20:08.432 --> 20:11.667
The body that you found, it's...

20:11.735 --> 20:13.502
it's definitely him?

20:14.688 --> 20:17.473
The real estate agent
confirmed from your photograph

20:17.541 --> 20:19.708
that he showed your husband
that house yesterday.

20:19.777 --> 20:23.045
Do you have any idea why he'd be
using the name Bill Johns?

20:23.114 --> 20:25.314
No.

20:25.382 --> 20:27.049
Why did he say he was in New York?

20:27.118 --> 20:29.718
He's a trader. His company's
at the Board of Trade.

20:29.787 --> 20:32.454
He travels east all the time, or...

20:32.523 --> 20:35.691
Did he ever mention a house
at 3507 South Wallace?

20:35.759 --> 20:37.392
Or moving?

20:37.461 --> 20:41.029
He always wanted
to paint our front door red.

20:42.700 --> 20:46.101
Maybe it was a... a surprise?

20:49.373 --> 20:52.374
Were you guys having any problems?

20:52.443 --> 20:54.576
No.

20:54.645 --> 20:57.346
We were good.

20:57.414 --> 21:00.649
Or, I... I thought we were.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.385
Could there have been
someone else in his life?

21:06.090 --> 21:08.223
Well, I don't know anything, do I?

21:14.098 --> 21:18.142
Curt Framingham worked for Metro
Gold Central for five years.

21:18.324 --> 21:19.642
No employment before here,

21:19.703 --> 21:21.737
and no Curt Framingham
in Chicago before that.

21:21.805 --> 21:24.661
There's no Curt or Curtis
Framingham countrywide.

21:24.808 --> 21:29.125
Not in Lexus Nexus,
Face of the Nation, social media.

21:29.219 --> 21:32.321
However, we ran a multistate
DMV facial recognition

21:32.430 --> 21:34.616
and popped a match for Curt Forrester.

21:34.685 --> 21:36.719
- Kevin, would you be so kind?
- Yes, ma'am.

21:36.805 --> 21:39.525
Great. So, Curt Forrester,
AKA Curt Framingham,

21:39.611 --> 21:43.592
was arrested in Indianapolis in
2010 for running a Ponzi scheme.

21:43.660 --> 21:46.461
He funneled client savings to
these money-losing businesses

21:46.530 --> 21:48.897
to line his own pockets
with finder's fees.

21:48.966 --> 21:51.967
The SEC lost the case when
a key witness died during trial.

21:52.035 --> 21:55.919
It was a boating accident.
Looks like an actual accident.

21:55.944 --> 21:57.978
Call HIDTA.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.622
Run a deconfliction report
on Curt Framingham

22:00.724 --> 22:01.896
and on Metro Gold Capital.

22:01.977 --> 22:04.380
Let's see if the Feds are into this guy.

22:04.755 --> 22:07.427
I got a guy at the Fed who
gets me whatever I want to know.

22:07.518 --> 22:09.117
You want me to call him?

22:09.186 --> 22:11.253
We're good.

22:16.393 --> 22:20.043
Someone want to fill me in
on the office gossip?

22:20.113 --> 22:22.631
Um... your gang unit pulled indictments

22:22.700 --> 22:24.766
for everyone but you, so...

22:24.835 --> 22:27.569
why don't you tell us
how you worked that out?

22:27.638 --> 22:30.822
Well, maybe there was nothing to indict.

22:30.891 --> 22:32.929
Seven guys taken in, and one
in the clear? That happens.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.460
You wanna say something? Say it.

22:35.529 --> 22:36.561
I think I just did.

22:36.586 --> 22:38.613
I mean, there's only
a couple options, right?

22:38.683 --> 22:40.710
I mean, either you're dirty
and you got away with it,

22:40.734 --> 22:42.776
or you worked a deal.
I think we just want to know...

22:42.800 --> 22:44.881
You wrote parking tickets
for two years to get up here,

22:44.905 --> 22:45.963
and you're gonna lecture me?

22:45.987 --> 22:48.592
Come talk to me after you work
seven years on the front lines.

22:49.944 --> 22:52.153
There a problem?

22:53.928 --> 22:55.144
No, Sergeant.

22:55.253 --> 22:56.565
Well, that's good,

22:56.667 --> 22:59.083
'cause if I hear one more person
talk about anything

22:59.170 --> 23:02.171
other than this case and the
two people who were killed,

23:02.239 --> 23:05.078
I'll put you on the next transfer order.

23:08.167 --> 23:09.866
Try me.

23:22.259 --> 23:23.759
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:23.827 --> 23:26.361
I, I notified Commander Crawley,

23:26.430 --> 23:27.796
and Marvin's in holding.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.490
Holding? You had him arrested?

23:29.599 --> 23:32.310
Yeah. Injury was sustained
during a struggle with a police officer.

23:32.342 --> 23:33.802
That's an IOD, right?

23:33.871 --> 23:36.946
We got a guy without a home
in February in Chicago

23:37.016 --> 23:38.540
who just lost his dog,

23:38.609 --> 23:39.775
and you're gonna arrest him?

23:39.843 --> 23:42.744
By arresting him, it meant we could
run a mandatory blood draw.

23:42.813 --> 23:44.157
You compare that with your tests at Med.

23:44.181 --> 23:46.081
I just thought...

23:46.150 --> 23:47.516
Yeah.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.085
Good move.

23:50.154 --> 23:51.787
What about the dog?

23:52.790 --> 23:54.690
Seriously still worried about the dog?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.798
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

24:02.866 --> 24:03.920
I'm sorry.

24:04.045 --> 24:06.134
We're still looking
for your dog, Marvin.

24:06.203 --> 24:10.319
J-Jupiter took my-my-my dog.
He n-never came back.

24:10.397 --> 24:11.907
Jupiter's your friend?

24:11.976 --> 24:13.842
Jupiter went to a home.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.410
What's your dog's name?

24:15.479 --> 24:16.845
Rosie. Rosie!

24:16.914 --> 24:18.052
What color is she?

24:18.142 --> 24:21.110
Red. Red. Red.

24:21.185 --> 24:22.771
- Okay.
- Red.

24:22.873 --> 24:25.154
We're working on getting you
outta here real soon, Marvin.

24:27.491 --> 24:30.459
So, tell me: What do the Feds
have on Curt Framingham?

24:30.527 --> 24:32.576
We made the connection
between Forrester and Framingham

24:32.600 --> 24:33.695
four months ago.

24:33.764 --> 24:36.537
- So, why didn't you pick him up?
- You know the AUSA's office.

24:36.615 --> 24:39.568
They want a 99% chance the guy's
going away before we grab him.

24:39.826 --> 24:41.936
We were finalizing the paperwork
with the company.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.293
Now how much had he skimmed?

24:43.345 --> 24:45.478
Over 300 grand into personal accounts.

24:45.719 --> 24:48.120
But the company was looking
at over 3 million in losses.

24:48.317 --> 24:50.480
Could one of his investors have
figured it out and killed him?

24:50.504 --> 24:51.512
Unlikely.

24:51.629 --> 24:54.929
Metro Gold covered their accounts
before any client looked twice.

24:55.419 --> 24:56.561
List of his clients.

24:56.679 --> 24:58.729
You ever hear about him
using the name Bill Johns

24:58.785 --> 25:00.846
for anything... William Johns?

25:01.143 --> 25:04.559
Ballistics got a match. Gun's a .22
registered to Roxanne Cabrera.

25:04.628 --> 25:06.425
Roxanne Cabrera on your list?

25:06.505 --> 25:07.609
Nah.

25:07.729 --> 25:08.758
We've got an address.

25:08.783 --> 25:10.804
- All right, Rixton and Atwater.
- Yeah.

25:13.804 --> 25:16.672
Sorry. I broke my ankle
in a car accident last night.

25:16.740 --> 25:17.804
I was in the hospital.

25:17.855 --> 25:20.445
No. I'm sorry to hear that.
When did you get home?

25:20.544 --> 25:22.477
An hour ago. What is this about?

25:23.077 --> 25:25.280
Ms. Cabrera, you wouldn't happen

25:25.342 --> 25:26.581
to own a weapon, would you?

25:26.650 --> 25:28.584
I have a gun. It's registered.

25:28.670 --> 25:30.256
Okay. When's the last time you used it?

25:30.354 --> 25:32.421
Two weeks ago. I went shooting
with some friends.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.590
- Whose gear?
- My brother's.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.291
The accident happened late last night.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.459
He came to feed the cat.

25:37.528 --> 25:38.848
Okay. What's your brother's name?

25:38.896 --> 25:40.295
Rafael, but...

25:40.364 --> 25:41.663
Same last name?

25:41.732 --> 25:43.799
Yes. Whatever this is...

25:43.867 --> 25:46.435
Your weapon was used
in a shooting this morning.

25:46.503 --> 25:49.271
That's impossible.
I keep my gun locked in a safe

25:49.340 --> 25:50.340
in the bedroom.

25:50.374 --> 25:51.440
Bedroom's that way?

25:51.508 --> 25:52.774
Yeah.

26:01.619 --> 26:03.452
I... I put it there myself.

26:03.520 --> 26:04.753
Okay. Step back, ma'am.

26:04.822 --> 26:06.488
Let's call Forensics
for prints, bro.

26:06.557 --> 26:07.489
Something else first.

26:07.554 --> 26:09.718
Your brother, Rafael...
has he been in trouble?

26:09.766 --> 26:12.242
Not since he moved here from Florida.

26:13.330 --> 26:15.918
Assault with a deadly weapon,
self-admitted gang member.

26:15.980 --> 26:18.834
Rafi was here last night with my fiancé.

26:18.902 --> 26:21.436
- What's your fiancé's name?
- Bill Johns.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.172
Perfect.

26:29.337 --> 26:31.056
How long have you been seeing Bill?

26:31.173 --> 26:32.305
Six months.

26:32.307 --> 26:34.074
He tell you what he did for a living?

26:34.143 --> 26:35.329
Finance.

26:35.407 --> 26:36.877
He tell you he was married before?

26:36.945 --> 26:38.645
Married still?

26:38.714 --> 26:39.813
No.

26:39.882 --> 26:41.648
We love each other.

26:41.717 --> 26:43.894
We're moving into a new house together.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.558
And why do you keep talking
about him in the past tense?

26:49.625 --> 26:51.591
Take a wild guess.

26:53.395 --> 26:55.629
He's dead?

26:58.467 --> 27:00.867
Bill wasn't even his name.
He was Curt Framingham.

27:00.936 --> 27:02.569
Before that, Curt Forrester.

27:02.638 --> 27:04.738
He's got a wife named Jane
in the suburbs.

27:04.807 --> 27:06.940
- No.
- Yes.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.310
Roxanne...

27:12.915 --> 27:15.649
Hey.

27:15.718 --> 27:17.384
What happened?

27:21.590 --> 27:25.025
The gun that killed
Curt Framingham belongs to you.

27:25.094 --> 27:28.013
And your brother was in your
house last night. He had access.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.863
Rafi doesn't even know the combination.

27:29.932 --> 27:31.765
It's 7-14-90. It's your birthday.

27:31.834 --> 27:34.334
You don't think
he could figure that out?

27:34.403 --> 27:36.703
Look. You found out Bill or Curt

27:36.772 --> 27:38.917
or whatever he called himself
was married, you got angry.

27:38.941 --> 27:41.007
- Any woman would.
- No!

27:41.076 --> 27:44.511
Okay, your brother found out,
defended your honor.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.918
Okay, where's Rafael?

27:54.022 --> 27:56.356
Where is Rafael?

27:57.426 --> 27:58.759
Roxanne,

27:58.827 --> 28:01.027
you got to be a big sister right now.

28:01.096 --> 28:04.931
If we put out a manhunt, this is
gonna go a whole lot worse.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.867
Just tell us where he is.

28:09.304 --> 28:11.304
In class,

28:11.407 --> 28:12.806
at Chicago City College.

28:12.875 --> 28:13.907
He's getting straight As.

28:13.976 --> 28:15.442
He's working so hard.

28:15.511 --> 28:17.744
I want to be there
when you talk to him.

28:17.813 --> 28:19.579
Sorry.

28:22.980 --> 28:24.680
Okay.

28:27.122 --> 28:30.724
Hey. There's a Jane Framingham
downstairs.

28:30.793 --> 28:32.392
She asked to see you.

28:40.494 --> 28:41.790
God.

28:41.904 --> 28:43.904
I just keep running it over in my head.

28:43.972 --> 28:45.728
Meeting Prince Charming,
falling in love.

28:45.788 --> 28:48.197
Guy who has money, doesn't want mine.

28:49.077 --> 28:51.945
The house thing with the red door...

28:52.014 --> 28:54.781
that was for another woman, wasn't it?

28:54.850 --> 28:56.016
Mrs. Framingham...

28:56.084 --> 28:58.919
Is she pretty? Younger?

29:00.923 --> 29:02.923
Both.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.991
Did she kill him?

29:05.060 --> 29:07.300
I mean, just... maybe there's
some justice in this world.

29:07.362 --> 29:09.930
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

29:09.998 --> 29:13.533
I keep thinking
maybe if I wasn't so stupid...

29:13.602 --> 29:15.469
Just tell me what you know.

29:15.537 --> 29:17.971
Do you know that your husband
had another name

29:18.040 --> 29:19.973
before he met you?

29:20.033 --> 29:21.196
Forrester.

29:21.579 --> 29:23.245
You're kidding me.

29:25.383 --> 29:27.800
You should start moving on.

29:27.885 --> 29:29.752
I've got to get back upstairs.

29:34.842 --> 29:37.593
Well, your sister says
you and her fiancé were

29:37.679 --> 29:38.561
at her place last night.

29:38.596 --> 29:40.680
Yeah. He stayed for an hour, then left.

29:40.765 --> 29:42.848
What, so you followed him
back out to the suburbs,

29:42.934 --> 29:45.401
see his big house, his wife?

29:45.436 --> 29:46.852
What are you talking about?

29:46.938 --> 29:50.022
You found out what he was
up to last night.

29:50.108 --> 29:52.742
This morning, you went over to the place

29:52.777 --> 29:54.243
he was gonna rent for your sister,

29:54.278 --> 29:55.695
and you shot him in the face.

29:55.780 --> 29:57.697
What? No.

29:57.782 --> 29:59.582
Rafael, stop. Don't embarrass yourself.

29:59.617 --> 30:00.911
We know exactly what happened.

30:00.936 --> 30:02.868
Doused him in paint thinner,
pulled the gas hose,

30:02.954 --> 30:04.587
went to class like nothing happened.

30:04.622 --> 30:05.921
Man, I would never do that.

30:05.957 --> 30:07.590
Sure you would. You already have.

30:07.625 --> 30:10.760
Like that time in Florida
you took a baseball bat to a guy

30:10.795 --> 30:12.962
'cause he tried to steal
a package off your porch.

30:13.047 --> 30:15.381
No. I've changed. I didn't hurt Bill.

30:15.406 --> 30:16.642
All right, then explain it to us,

30:16.666 --> 30:18.426
'cause you were the last
person with the guy.

30:18.456 --> 30:21.303
You have motive, no alibi,
history of violence...

30:24.442 --> 30:26.776
Found it in the sister's
building storage. It's a .22.

30:26.811 --> 30:29.945
Serial number matches
the sister's registration.

30:29.981 --> 30:31.731
Oops.

30:31.816 --> 30:33.866
Should've found a better hiding spot.

30:33.951 --> 30:35.317
Man, somebody set me up!

30:35.403 --> 30:36.952
I swear to God, I've changed.

30:36.988 --> 30:38.654
Well, you didn't change enough.

30:38.740 --> 30:40.706
Get up. We're booking you for murder.

30:40.792 --> 30:43.325
Get up. Let's go.

30:48.916 --> 30:52.051
Hey. April from Med...

30:52.136 --> 30:53.836
test came back negative for hepatitis.

30:53.921 --> 30:55.838
Only insulin found on the needle.

30:57.108 --> 30:58.818
Now, they still got to do
the blood drop on Marvin,

30:58.842 --> 31:00.810
but the VA reports from last week showed

31:00.845 --> 31:04.396
that hepatitis was his only
communicable disease,

31:04.482 --> 31:07.900
so... you're in the clear.

31:21.916 --> 31:24.500
My gosh.

31:24.535 --> 31:27.086
Look at you. Who are you?

31:27.171 --> 31:29.672
I don't believe it.

31:29.707 --> 31:33.008
Come on, little sweet thing.
Look at you.

31:33.044 --> 31:35.711
Look at your little face. Come on.

31:36.931 --> 31:40.516
Marvin? Marvin, I got a present for ya.

31:40.551 --> 31:43.769
Rosie!

31:43.855 --> 31:45.855
You found my Rosie-Rosie!

31:45.890 --> 31:48.524
Rosie! You found her.
You found my Rosie!

31:48.559 --> 31:49.999
How did you... how did you find her?

31:50.061 --> 31:52.812
Well, I didn't do anything.
She found you.

31:52.897 --> 31:56.031
Jupiter took-took-took my dog,
and then he never...

31:56.067 --> 31:57.950
never came back... never, never.

31:58.035 --> 31:59.535
Well, shame on Jupiter, then?

31:59.570 --> 32:02.571
"Jupiter wanted to go
to the home," the man asked.

32:02.657 --> 32:04.635
Okay, well, we're gonna
get you out of here now, Marvin,

32:04.659 --> 32:05.708
get you some help.

32:05.743 --> 32:06.959
J-Jupiter g-g-go to a home...

32:07.044 --> 32:08.961
he go to the home... he go... he go,

32:09.046 --> 32:10.830
and then he always wanted to see...

32:10.915 --> 32:14.049
- Okay, up we go.
- With the big red door.

32:14.085 --> 32:15.301
What did you say?

32:15.496 --> 32:19.004
Jupiter always wanted to see
the house with the big red door.

32:19.090 --> 32:21.006
The-the-the man showed him. He did.

32:21.092 --> 32:23.926
He took my dog. He took my-my-my Rosie.

32:24.011 --> 32:25.845
Jupiter took the dog with him

32:25.930 --> 32:29.666
after a man offered to show him
a home with a big red door?

32:29.780 --> 32:32.189
Is that when she went missing?

32:33.571 --> 32:35.487
Why is your friend called Jupiter?

32:35.573 --> 32:37.940
Jupiter's the biggest of all planets.

32:38.910 --> 32:40.693
How big is Jupiter?

32:42.947 --> 32:44.663
Sit tight, Marvin.

32:46.701 --> 32:49.451
Hi, Rosie. Hi, Rosie.

32:52.006 --> 32:54.817
The house that blew up with
your victim... it had a red door?

32:54.911 --> 32:56.825
- That's right.
- And the victim was 6'3"?

32:56.888 --> 32:58.529
- Yeah.
- Who was he?

32:58.592 --> 33:00.642
Half a con artist living a double life.

33:00.775 --> 33:02.725
Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.

33:07.598 --> 33:09.925
Marvin, is this the man
who approached you last night?

33:10.003 --> 33:11.123
You and your friend Jupiter?

33:11.207 --> 33:14.293
I thought Jupiter had my dog.

33:14.356 --> 33:15.809
M-m-my dog Rosie.

33:15.886 --> 33:18.534
Okay, so you left together.
Do you know where?

33:19.194 --> 33:21.716
I thought Jupiter took my... my dog,

33:21.785 --> 33:23.950
so I followed... I followed Jupiter,

33:23.999 --> 33:25.810
and then the man,
and then they went to the house

33:25.834 --> 33:27.500
w-with the red door.

33:27.586 --> 33:29.002
Is that the place?

33:29.087 --> 33:32.222
That! Yes! The big red door!

33:32.307 --> 33:33.840
The big red door!

33:35.060 --> 33:37.644
Thank you. This really, really helps.

33:37.679 --> 33:41.815
Jupiter okay? I'm not m-mad anymore.

33:41.850 --> 33:43.149
I have Rosie back.

33:43.185 --> 33:44.818
Jupiter okay?

33:44.853 --> 33:46.770
Jupiter's okay.

33:49.992 --> 33:52.859
Way to go, Marvin. You did real good.

33:57.499 --> 33:58.365
Hey, we got a hit on Framingham

33:58.450 --> 34:00.200
at a car rental place
on Lake Park Avenue.

34:00.285 --> 34:01.751
It's rented to a Curt Forrester.

34:01.837 --> 34:04.671
The same credit card was used at a
gas station on 94, heading north.

34:04.706 --> 34:06.006
Is he going to Canada?

34:06.041 --> 34:08.842
And at a motel off 94, half an hour ago.

34:08.877 --> 34:10.241
He's bunking down for the night.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.210
All right, let's roll.
We're gonna get this bastard

34:12.234 --> 34:14.047
before he skips town completely.

34:21.973 --> 34:23.806
Room 125.

34:23.891 --> 34:26.025
124 isn't occupied, but 126 is.

34:26.061 --> 34:28.194
All right, we'll stack at the door.

34:41.043 --> 34:42.574
Hands up! Get your hands up!

34:42.661 --> 34:44.188
- Don't move!
- Hey! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

34:44.212 --> 34:45.245
Jay...

34:46.797 --> 34:49.081
Police! Keep your hands
where we can see them.

34:49.167 --> 34:51.000
Get against the wall.
Against the wall, now!

34:51.085 --> 34:53.168
Against the wall.

34:55.924 --> 34:57.757
Put your hands behind your back.

35:05.901 --> 35:08.184
You totally had me fooled.

35:08.270 --> 35:10.270
- All right, get her dressed.
- Sit down.

35:14.393 --> 35:16.109
Sit down.

35:22.250 --> 35:26.035
Your husband...
is he actually your husband?

35:26.121 --> 35:28.288
Your partner-in-crime?

35:28.373 --> 35:30.090
He just lawyered up.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.654
I want a lawyer as well.

35:31.759 --> 35:34.803
That's fine. We have plenty enough
to ring you up on as it is,

35:34.896 --> 35:36.262
so you don't need to say anything,

35:36.298 --> 35:38.181
but you are gonna listen.

35:39.386 --> 35:42.218
Leon Tremaine. Also known as Jupiter.

35:42.304 --> 35:45.855
He was a boxer who almost made
the Olympic team in 2000.

35:45.941 --> 35:47.607
All the fighting gave him brain damage

35:47.642 --> 35:50.110
and turned him homeless.

35:50.145 --> 35:52.729
He wandered to Chicago
all the way from Indiana.

35:52.814 --> 35:54.948
He had just reconnected
with his daughter,

35:54.983 --> 35:59.619
who'd been looking for him
for ten years.

35:59.654 --> 36:02.122
That's who your husband
put a bullet into.

36:02.157 --> 36:04.824
That's who you put a bullet into,

36:04.910 --> 36:07.160
because you're gonna
get charged the same.

36:08.663 --> 36:10.964
Kyle Harvey was 18 years old.

36:10.999 --> 36:13.166
He lost his mom right before
his dad kicked him out

36:13.251 --> 36:15.218
of the house... twice,

36:15.303 --> 36:17.170
and he was coming back to the only place

36:17.255 --> 36:18.472
that had ever treated him well

36:18.554 --> 36:20.805
when he died in the fire
you guys rigged.

36:21.176 --> 36:23.009
That's how Kyle died.

36:24.813 --> 36:26.813
Look at him.

36:26.848 --> 36:28.431
Look at him!

36:28.517 --> 36:29.649
You're hurting me.

36:29.684 --> 36:31.351
You don't know what hurting is.

36:31.436 --> 36:33.353
Do you want me to show you?

36:33.438 --> 36:36.189
I'd be happy to.
Just nod your head at me.

36:41.413 --> 36:43.112
You knew the Feds were closing in,

36:43.198 --> 36:46.249
so you decided to fake
your husband's funeral.

36:46.334 --> 36:48.284
Well, guess what, sweetheart.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.036
This is your funeral now.

37:03.591 --> 37:05.888
Hey, um,

37:06.279 --> 37:10.440
I'd... I'd like to publicly apologize.

37:12.143 --> 37:16.196
There were some whispers
and some gossip.

37:16.231 --> 37:19.020
I ran with it,
and I shouldn't have, okay?

37:19.622 --> 37:22.223
You know, this... this whole nonsense...

37:22.317 --> 37:25.038
I was leading the charge on this.
I'm sorry, man.

37:25.216 --> 37:27.490
I had a bad experience
with a guy in my unit

37:27.576 --> 37:28.875
when I was overseas,

37:28.910 --> 37:30.842
who was not who he claimed to be.

37:30.923 --> 37:33.420
And that's my problem. That's not yours.

37:34.416 --> 37:37.333
You're a solid dude, and a good cop,

37:37.419 --> 37:41.337
so whatever happened in the gang
unit doesn't matter, all right?

37:41.423 --> 37:43.967
Man to man, and to the whole team,

37:44.139 --> 37:46.809
um, I'm sorry.

37:48.686 --> 37:51.253
Yeah, you can count me in on that, too.

37:53.735 --> 37:54.901
My bad, dog.

37:56.822 --> 38:00.040
The sister of one of the
gang unit cops was beat up

38:00.075 --> 38:03.827
after she turned in a banger
for robbing her place.

38:03.912 --> 38:06.296
ASA didn't have enough to
convict the guy who did it,

38:06.381 --> 38:08.665
so Rixton's unit went after him.

38:10.886 --> 38:13.922
But Kenny wasn't with them.

38:14.089 --> 38:16.750
Two cars belonging
to other members of the unit

38:16.868 --> 38:18.258
were spotted by plate readers

38:18.359 --> 38:20.943
one block from where
the payback beating went down

38:21.641 --> 38:23.868
at the same time it happened.

38:24.300 --> 38:25.933
And one of those...

38:26.015 --> 38:28.682
one of those cars was approached
by a patrolman

38:28.854 --> 38:31.938
who was told they were
on a narcotics sting,

38:32.023 --> 38:34.809
but they'd already clocked out.

38:35.944 --> 38:37.958
So it had to be a lie.

38:39.114 --> 38:41.948
That's how they got caught.
Not by anything Kenny did.

38:43.618 --> 38:46.169
I was approached by IAD,

38:46.237 --> 38:50.398
but turned down a deal,
and I never said a word.

38:50.759 --> 38:52.414
Not that my unit believed me.

38:52.555 --> 38:54.312
Why didn't you just say that
in the first place?

38:54.336 --> 38:57.641
Because I told him not to.
We were working a case.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.970
Plus, his last unit iced him out
over a rumor.

39:01.064 --> 39:02.886
I wanted to see if you guys
were any better.

39:04.423 --> 39:06.029
How did we do?

39:08.914 --> 39:10.581
I'll see you at Molly's.

39:33.969 --> 39:35.492
Adam.

39:39.619 --> 39:41.601
Hey.

39:41.718 --> 39:43.843
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

39:44.012 --> 39:45.598
- I'm good.
- Good.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.387
And... and the undercover assignment?

39:47.504 --> 39:50.066
It's over. Yeah.

39:51.988 --> 39:53.738
Listen...

39:55.240 --> 39:57.586
I kind of ran from Intelligence.

39:58.193 --> 40:02.008
I'll admit I wasn't ready
to work side-by-side with you.

40:02.196 --> 40:03.797
It was stupid.

40:04.199 --> 40:06.141
It's like my family up there.

40:06.485 --> 40:08.115
I'd really like to come back.

40:08.336 --> 40:09.763
Okay.

40:09.873 --> 40:12.922
- Is that okay with you?
- Yes.

40:13.008 --> 40:14.174
- You sure?
- Yes.

40:14.295 --> 40:16.576
- Okay, 'cause that was kind of quick.
- Yes!

40:17.125 --> 40:18.841
Welcome back.
