WEBVTT

00:11.704 --> 00:13.085
How well did you know him?

00:14.328 --> 00:15.605
My brother.

00:15.605 --> 00:18.711
We're sweeping up the garbage
the Royal Commission missed.

00:18.711 --> 00:20.023
The ones who got away.

00:20.023 --> 00:22.439
Anyone who runs a business
in the Cross pays protection.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.545
- From who?
- From me.

00:24.545 --> 00:26.616
Now we've got every
two-bit fucking gangster

00:26.616 --> 00:28.411
in the state, on the strip.

00:28.411 --> 00:30.171
We might have just
started a war.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.416
It's cool, uh, we got
the green light.

00:35.590 --> 00:36.453
Fuck!

00:36.453 --> 00:38.179
I want 'em all cleared out.

00:38.179 --> 00:39.387
Grab some boys
to go with you,

00:39.387 --> 00:41.320
in case you going
to be scared, yeah?

00:41.320 --> 00:44.047
Oh, fuck, Sam,
no, fuck, Sam.

00:46.705 --> 00:48.949
You need to curb your dog

00:48.949 --> 00:50.674
or there'll be consequences.

00:50.674 --> 00:53.367
Tell your boss
to go fuck himself.

00:53.367 --> 00:56.715
It's 800 feet of road.

00:56.715 --> 00:59.269
You can't control that?
It's not fucking Columbia!

00:59.269 --> 01:00.581
Go!

01:06.414 --> 01:07.588
Double homicide.

01:07.588 --> 01:09.797
It's not the best look
for a senator, is it?

01:11.005 --> 01:12.317
Change your statement.

01:13.387 --> 01:15.561
Do you know how it feels
to have to stick up for you,

01:15.561 --> 01:17.908
when you are actively
the one fucking us over?

01:52.150 --> 01:53.289
What's up?

02:20.799 --> 02:23.457
I'm going to get us
some coffees.

02:27.944 --> 02:31.499
What the fuck?
Look at this fucking shit.

02:33.087 --> 02:34.226
You gonna let that
piece of shit

02:34.226 --> 02:35.331
to get the fuck
away with this?

02:35.331 --> 02:36.401
We're going to chase
every last one

02:36.401 --> 02:38.023
of these cunts down,
you understand?

02:38.023 --> 02:38.955
Yes, Sammy.

02:38.955 --> 02:39.956
- You understand?
- Fuck yeah!

02:39.956 --> 02:41.785
These fucks are
paying with blood.

02:44.650 --> 02:45.720
You finished?

02:47.377 --> 02:48.930
What the fuck are
you doing here?

02:48.930 --> 02:50.070
What am I doing?

02:50.070 --> 02:50.967
I'm doing what you
should have done.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.002
I'm here to protect
the fucking street.

02:52.002 --> 02:53.245
Protect?

02:53.245 --> 02:54.902
By turning up with your
tooled up idiots off your face!

02:54.902 --> 02:57.042
How's that protecting anyone?

02:57.042 --> 02:58.630
How's it make you any better?

02:58.630 --> 03:00.494
How's it going to get any
worse than this, John?

03:00.494 --> 03:01.771
Do you still not get it?

03:02.875 --> 03:05.085
You blow up that car,
they burn down my club.

03:06.362 --> 03:08.847
You fire more shots at them,
they fire more shots at us.

03:08.847 --> 03:11.815
Okay, where does it end?
Them blowing up Mum's house?

03:13.748 --> 03:16.026
This is exactly
what he wants.

03:16.303 --> 03:18.028
Okay, us fighting.

03:18.926 --> 03:21.204
Now Ezra doesn't have his
jacks doing his dirty work,

03:21.204 --> 03:22.516
he's got these little
fuckers doing it.

03:22.516 --> 03:25.277
Okay? He wants a reaction
from you and you, and,

03:25.277 --> 03:26.485
you're giving it to him.

03:26.485 --> 03:28.694
You're playing into
his hand. Just...

03:38.187 --> 03:39.188
You do you.

03:40.120 --> 03:40.948
Remember?

03:42.812 --> 03:44.020
I'll do me.

03:50.475 --> 03:52.787
Fuck, you got
so much Mum in you.

04:24.405 --> 04:27.063
You told us under oath that
Crellan shot Nasa Kalouri

04:27.063 --> 04:29.686
out the front of his house
and left him for dead.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.379
That was my recollection.

04:32.379 --> 04:33.828
But as you guys know,

04:33.828 --> 04:36.900
I was under a lot of pressure
to make a quick statement.

04:36.900 --> 04:39.489
Since then, I've had
time to decompress

04:39.489 --> 04:41.284
and I realise I made
a huge mistake.

04:42.768 --> 04:44.322
Well, now you're making
an even bigger one

04:44.322 --> 04:45.495
by changing your story.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.328
Fuck, eh! You must be
pumped to see him.

04:51.225 --> 04:52.502
What's on the cards?

04:52.502 --> 04:54.366
A pop down the pub,
have a few beers,

04:54.366 --> 04:56.265
run through a list of cops
who have topped themselves?

04:56.265 --> 04:57.542
How fun.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.405
Look,

05:00.890 --> 05:03.030
I know you want this
to be over with.

05:03.030 --> 05:05.688
Fuck's sake, shut up!

05:08.794 --> 05:09.795
Declan.

05:11.072 --> 05:12.350
We really want to help you,

05:13.454 --> 05:16.526
but we can't protect you
unless we know

05:16.526 --> 05:18.356
who we're protecting
you from.

05:22.981 --> 05:25.363
I don't know what to tell ya.
All right?

05:26.295 --> 05:27.434
My memory changed.

05:28.918 --> 05:30.126
That's all I got to say.

05:31.714 --> 05:32.784
Excuse me.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.827
Now, if you guys don't mind,
my family's getting home,

05:41.827 --> 05:44.278
and I've got a fucking
shit load to do.

05:51.630 --> 05:55.393
The smart money's on
Bill Allen, by the way.

05:55.393 --> 05:57.947
And believe me, if the
Assistant Commissioner

05:57.947 --> 06:00.605
gave you up once,
he can do it again.

06:03.677 --> 06:07.163
Think about that when you
tuck your kids in tonight.

06:25.181 --> 06:26.147
Three months for murder.

06:26.147 --> 06:28.218
That is some magical
bullocks, mate.

06:29.358 --> 06:31.808
It's got to be some kind
of record, doesn't it?

06:31.808 --> 06:34.880
I mean, who'd you have to
suck off to get out so quick?

06:34.880 --> 06:37.297
Old mate just caught a
sudden dose of amnesia.

06:38.781 --> 06:39.782
Right.

06:40.438 --> 06:41.301
Really?

06:44.027 --> 06:45.063
Fuck you.

06:46.685 --> 06:49.205
I was looking at
well over a decade

06:49.205 --> 06:51.103
and I kept my mouth shut.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.971
Also, do you pricks have any
idea how much I loved my job?

06:57.972 --> 07:01.562
I was a cop for 22 years and
I loved every minute of it.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.462
And the blokes that I went
to work with every day,

07:04.462 --> 07:05.670
I considered them my family.

07:05.670 --> 07:07.603
I'd take a fucking
bullet for them.

07:07.603 --> 07:11.503
And yet I gave all of that
up to protect you guys.

07:11.503 --> 07:13.056
Not to mention having
the Royal Commission

07:13.056 --> 07:14.644
take that away
from me permanently,

07:14.644 --> 07:17.647
so are you fucking kidding me
with the attitude?

07:20.270 --> 07:21.720
Well, now,
I think it's about time

07:21.720 --> 07:23.343
you picked a
fucking side, innit?

07:27.450 --> 07:28.417
When do I start?

07:48.885 --> 07:52.717
You know, you could always
just tell them who did it.

08:02.934 --> 08:06.006
Come on, John.
It's not rocket science.

08:06.006 --> 08:07.421
On one side of the street,

08:07.421 --> 08:08.457
your brother's trying
to fill the hole

08:08.629 --> 08:11.183
in the Kings Cross drug
market left by Joey Romano.

08:11.183 --> 08:12.046
And on the other,

08:12.253 --> 08:14.428
the Bui Doi think it's
theirs for the taking.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.292
That's not going to end well.

08:16.292 --> 08:18.881
Then there's you in the
middle with nothing to gain

08:18.881 --> 08:20.503
and everything to lose.

08:24.714 --> 08:26.164
You're telling me
my life story?

08:26.164 --> 08:28.373
Yeah, and the only
person who can stop it

08:28.373 --> 08:30.202
doesn't seem to
be doing anything.

08:31.341 --> 08:33.067
So you could be forgiven
for thinking that

08:33.067 --> 08:35.449
Ezra's stoking the flames,
couldn't you?

08:36.208 --> 08:39.522
Like, I assume that's what the
garden party was all about?

08:39.522 --> 08:41.386
Ezra Shipman and his mates?

08:41.386 --> 08:44.769
The ex-Senator and the
Assistant Commissioner of
Police?

08:44.769 --> 08:46.564
Hot and cold
running girls laid on.

08:52.501 --> 08:54.261
That was you?

08:56.505 --> 08:57.678
Yeah, I...

08:58.817 --> 09:00.405
I hope they were useful.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.375
See, you and I, we've,

09:05.375 --> 09:07.826
we've always wanted
the same thing, John.

09:09.241 --> 09:11.002
Just for different reasons.

09:16.904 --> 09:19.182
Right now, I'm just trying
to keep my brother alive.

09:36.027 --> 09:37.580
- Hey, Sam!
- Gentlemen.

09:37.580 --> 09:39.271
- Hey, mate.
- Sammy.

09:42.792 --> 09:45.312
Mm, nice.

09:48.798 --> 09:51.974
- Hey. What are you doing?
- What?

09:52.871 --> 09:53.907
You don't get to sit down

09:53.907 --> 09:55.702
until every last slope
is off the street.

09:58.705 --> 09:59.671
Righto.

10:20.450 --> 10:23.212
How many years have we
worked together then?

10:23.212 --> 10:25.904
- 30-odd years.
- Right.

10:26.318 --> 10:29.011
In all that time, right,

10:29.011 --> 10:31.392
how many people have tried
to take over the Cross?

10:32.773 --> 10:35.293
It's a long fucking list, boss.

10:35.293 --> 10:37.364
All right, but how many
have succeeded, though?

10:37.364 --> 10:38.607
Just one.

10:39.849 --> 10:41.644
You might want to
remind Sam of that.

10:53.173 --> 10:54.174
Hey, mate.

10:55.727 --> 10:56.590
You around?

10:59.420 --> 11:00.594
Righto.

11:21.684 --> 11:24.584
Look at you.
Barely aged a day.

11:25.757 --> 11:26.896
Funny, that.

11:30.935 --> 11:32.592
So how you want to do this?

11:34.490 --> 11:36.941
I figured you'd called to sort
out the money for old mate.

11:36.941 --> 11:40.669
Nah, don't worry about that.
My way of saying thanks.

11:41.221 --> 11:42.532
If you'd gotten
talkative on the stand,

11:42.532 --> 11:43.741
we might have been
having this little chat

11:43.741 --> 11:45.743
from the rec yard
at Long Bay instead.

11:47.468 --> 11:49.194
Long Bay might be
the safest place for you

11:49.194 --> 11:50.299
from what I'm hearing.

11:51.852 --> 11:54.061
Your brother seems
to have poked the bear.

11:55.994 --> 11:57.547
Fuck, Johnny.

11:59.101 --> 12:01.413
You're the owner of the four
biggest clubs in the country.

12:01.413 --> 12:02.932
You're making serious coin

12:02.932 --> 12:05.141
and you want to get
into a drug war?

12:07.937 --> 12:09.249
You're the one who
never wanted drugs

12:09.249 --> 12:10.837
in the Cross
in the first place.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.013
Family.

12:16.325 --> 12:18.845
- Hell of a thing.
- Yeah.

12:20.294 --> 12:22.434
Last of the crazy Lebs, huh?

12:28.544 --> 12:32.893
- Is that what you reckon?
- Johnny. Crazy? Yeah.

12:34.584 --> 12:36.586
But the rest of it? Well.

12:38.934 --> 12:40.418
That's a little premature.

12:44.456 --> 12:46.148
I need to hear
the words, mate.

12:50.014 --> 12:52.637
Ezra wasn't too fast when I
was looking down the barrel

12:52.637 --> 12:55.088
at well over a decade in
a twelve-by-eight cell.

12:55.088 --> 13:00.403
You did something about it.
And I'll never forget it.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.035
Cross is changing, Johnny.

13:11.863 --> 13:14.176
Crowds are thinning,
moving up to Oxford Street,

13:14.176 --> 13:16.040
away from the violence.

13:19.284 --> 13:21.424
We have to keep up with
the times, don't we?

13:23.495 --> 13:24.600
It's food for thought.

13:28.190 --> 13:30.399
But if you ever need
me to square that debt,

13:30.399 --> 13:33.160
then you just say the word.

13:37.820 --> 13:40.927
Don't ever bring a gun
to a meet with me again.

13:42.825 --> 13:44.827
You don't need it.

14:19.034 --> 14:21.381
Hey, you! You're home early.

14:23.832 --> 14:25.109
Yeah, it was a,

14:26.282 --> 14:27.628
slow night.

14:33.186 --> 14:34.635
Whatcha doing?

14:35.809 --> 14:40.400
Just reading about the little
island my Yaya's from, Ikaria.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.608
Check it out.

14:42.195 --> 14:45.370
It's known as the island
where people forget to die.

14:45.370 --> 14:47.338
How cool is that?

14:47.338 --> 14:50.099
One in three people
live till 90.

14:51.445 --> 14:52.722
How come?

14:53.413 --> 14:54.932
No one's really sure.

14:55.656 --> 14:58.176
Lots of olive oil and, um,

14:58.176 --> 15:00.558
not too many nightclubs, apparently.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.600
Sounds unreal.

15:09.222 --> 15:12.052
Oh. It's real, all right.

15:13.157 --> 15:15.366
In 24 hours,

15:15.366 --> 15:19.439
we could be eating
grilled octopus and

15:19.922 --> 15:23.374
sitting on a beach,
sipping cold beer.

15:24.030 --> 15:27.240
Just say the word.

15:39.873 --> 15:41.702
I mean, why the sudden change?

15:41.702 --> 15:43.014
I mean, John does a good job.

15:43.014 --> 15:44.947
The system's been
in place for years.

15:45.948 --> 15:48.571
I'm just passing on
the message, mate.

15:48.571 --> 15:50.159
What, and he's
okay with this?

15:51.574 --> 15:53.128
John will understand.

15:53.128 --> 15:56.372
But you haven't told him yet?
What about Sam?

15:58.512 --> 15:59.651
What about Sam?

16:01.619 --> 16:03.759
Let me ask you all a question.

16:03.759 --> 16:06.693
Do you think Ezra needs
the Ibrahim's permission

16:06.693 --> 16:08.522
to change things
up around here?

16:08.522 --> 16:10.593
Just might be worth
a chat, that's all.

16:10.593 --> 16:12.802
Yeah. Just to keep the peace.

16:12.802 --> 16:14.494
Well, who says Ezra
wants peace?

16:17.428 --> 16:19.879
Let me be very fucking clear.

16:19.879 --> 16:22.329
If Ezra Shipman wants to
make a change on the strip,

16:22.329 --> 16:23.537
that's his call.

16:23.537 --> 16:26.368
And do you know why? Do you?

16:27.610 --> 16:29.474
'Cause it's his fucking strip.

16:30.786 --> 16:32.132
Now, if any of you
think otherwise,

16:32.132 --> 16:33.996
I'd be happy to
pass on your feedback.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.482
The Ibrahims,
they're fucking out.

16:38.828 --> 16:42.073
From now on, you can
come directly to Ezra.

16:42.073 --> 16:43.799
Are we fucking clear?

17:47.207 --> 17:48.036
Yeah.

17:50.728 --> 17:52.661
Steph, this is not a good time.

17:59.323 --> 18:00.289
I'm trying to stop the street

18:00.289 --> 18:01.842
going up in flames
and you pull this shit.

18:01.842 --> 18:03.327
What the fuck are
you trying to do?

18:03.327 --> 18:04.569
What am I doing?

18:05.743 --> 18:08.435
Thank you, sweetheart.
I'm doing my fucking job, John.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.506
Which is looking after
my boss's best interests.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.646
How is any of this
in Ezra's interests?

18:14.372 --> 18:15.960
You don't think I know
what he's doing?

18:15.960 --> 18:18.652
Pitting me against Sam.
Steering you and I into each other.

18:18.652 --> 18:20.758
Do you not see what he's doing?

18:20.758 --> 18:21.621
It's not going to be forever.

18:21.621 --> 18:22.518
Just take your
fucking medicine.

18:22.622 --> 18:24.865
No, fuck that, okay?
It's not happening.

18:24.865 --> 18:27.799
Ezra has nothing to sell
anymore, so I'm not buying it.

18:27.799 --> 18:30.354
You listen to me
really fucking carefully.

18:30.354 --> 18:32.045
You'll be really careful
about what you say

18:32.045 --> 18:34.220
'cause do you really want
to go down that path?

18:35.393 --> 18:37.223
'Cause if you call out
Ezra Shipman,

18:37.223 --> 18:39.397
it ain't fucking
ending well.

18:46.163 --> 18:48.958
You know, when I first
came to the Cross, I th...

18:48.958 --> 18:51.064
I thought it was
this crazy jungle.

18:51.064 --> 18:52.341
No order, no rules.

18:53.273 --> 18:54.447
Chaos.

18:55.551 --> 18:58.934
I mean, that's what it
looked to me, like as a kid.

18:59.797 --> 19:01.419
What the fuck did I know?

19:03.318 --> 19:04.526
But it was you.

19:04.526 --> 19:07.115
It was you who showed me
that there is a system.

19:07.115 --> 19:09.255
There's a business
based off respect,

19:09.255 --> 19:11.878
off trust,
off working together.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.399
That's all bullshit,
isn't it?

19:16.641 --> 19:18.850
There's no trust.
There's no respect.

19:18.850 --> 19:20.438
There's just fucking business.

19:20.438 --> 19:22.199
So you know what?
I'm fucking done.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.616
No more kickups.

19:25.616 --> 19:27.066
You can tell Ezra
I am cutting him off

19:27.066 --> 19:28.515
and not the other way around.

19:33.969 --> 19:34.763
Fuck.

19:35.971 --> 19:37.076
He said that?

19:38.629 --> 19:40.079
Well, words to that effect.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.979
He was upset, but he wasn't
thinking straight.

19:46.395 --> 19:48.259
Oh, he's fucking dead, man.

19:48.708 --> 19:50.468
Boss?

19:51.400 --> 19:52.574
Ezra?

20:18.462 --> 20:19.359
Yeah, hi.

20:20.809 --> 20:23.225
Yeah, it's me. Yeah.

20:25.193 --> 20:26.573
So, kill 'em.

20:28.851 --> 20:30.198
The both of them.

20:33.373 --> 20:35.375
Yeah.

20:43.383 --> 20:44.488
Hey.

20:46.490 --> 20:47.905
What time'd you get back?

20:49.907 --> 20:52.875
I don't know. Late.

20:52.875 --> 20:54.325
There was trouble.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.643
Can I ask you something?

21:02.091 --> 21:03.783
And I promise if you don't
want to talk about it,

21:03.783 --> 21:05.094
I'll let it go.

21:07.096 --> 21:08.408
You can ask me anything.

21:10.652 --> 21:12.067
How do you do it?

21:14.380 --> 21:15.553
Do what?

21:16.934 --> 21:18.453
This.

21:18.453 --> 21:20.040
Everything.

21:20.524 --> 21:22.664
I mean, if I had a week
like you've just had

21:22.664 --> 21:25.184
or a year like your last year,

21:25.184 --> 21:26.185
I mean, I'm going to be honest,

21:26.185 --> 21:28.911
if that's me,
I'm not sticking around.

21:35.677 --> 21:37.230
What choice do I have?

21:38.127 --> 21:39.163
It's who I am.

21:40.992 --> 21:43.823
No, it's what you do.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.791
They are two very
different things.

21:58.389 --> 22:00.046
It's not that simple.

22:01.427 --> 22:04.050
I've spent every waking
hour since I was 14

22:04.050 --> 22:05.465
trying to build...

22:06.604 --> 22:07.916
...something.

22:10.194 --> 22:12.438
Everything I have
is in those clubs.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.444
Not everything.

22:24.553 --> 22:26.659
For now, at least.

22:48.853 --> 22:53.755
Argh. No wonder why
everybody's take is down.

22:53.755 --> 22:56.309
I would head to
Oxford Street, too.

23:05.214 --> 23:07.424
These cigarettes are fucked.

23:07.424 --> 23:08.735
Go get me another packet.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.875
I got you a packet, Sam.

23:10.875 --> 23:13.292
There's still heaps in there.

23:20.264 --> 23:21.127
Whoops.

23:30.619 --> 23:32.103
4:00 PM.

23:32.103 --> 23:33.484
The pig.

23:38.696 --> 23:40.457
Anton's come through.

23:40.457 --> 23:43.045
Four o'clock.
Porky's.

24:07.311 --> 24:08.312
Hey.

24:08.312 --> 24:10.003
It's me. Where are you?

24:10.003 --> 24:10.901
At work. What's up?

24:11.280 --> 24:13.213
I've got a surprise
for you. Can I swing by?

24:13.213 --> 24:17.183
Of course you can. I'm at,
uh, Porky's. I'll be here.

24:17.183 --> 24:19.150
See you soon.

24:23.016 --> 24:24.293
All good?

24:26.088 --> 24:27.504
Yeah.

24:27.952 --> 24:30.369
- Is she okay?
- She's fine.

24:35.443 --> 24:36.754
Who am I kidding?

24:38.377 --> 24:39.688
She's amazing.

24:42.001 --> 24:43.312
Okay.

24:48.214 --> 24:50.699
Her brother's
Spyro Mavris.

24:50.699 --> 24:54.841
I know. Been taking cash to
the mum for years now, Johnny.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.291
From me.

25:02.055 --> 25:03.263
Okay.

25:04.230 --> 25:05.404
Yeah.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.130
And she doesn't know, eh?

25:08.924 --> 25:10.961
She knows I knew him,
that's it.

25:14.654 --> 25:17.243
Everytime I try
and tell her, I, I just...

25:18.451 --> 25:19.797
...feel I'm going to
ruin the best thing

25:19.797 --> 25:21.178
that's ever happened to me.

25:23.007 --> 25:24.664
You know, Johnny.

25:25.354 --> 25:26.977
If she's into you,

25:26.977 --> 25:28.806
she's into all of you.

25:30.498 --> 25:32.983
Tell her what happened.
If she go, she go.

25:32.983 --> 25:34.433
But if she stay,

25:37.228 --> 25:38.782
she stay for good.

25:41.578 --> 25:44.028
Truth is good for you, Johnny.

25:45.167 --> 25:46.375
Hmm?

26:09.053 --> 26:11.504
Sammy, you got a sec?

26:11.504 --> 26:13.817
Mate, I just spoke to John.
He wants to see ya.

26:14.369 --> 26:15.439
What does he want?

26:15.439 --> 26:16.405
I don't know.

26:16.544 --> 26:18.062
He just wants to chat
to you about something.

26:18.062 --> 26:20.340
Tell him he can come here
if he wants to talk to me.

26:20.340 --> 26:22.273
I did tell him that but
he's being a cock about it.

26:22.273 --> 26:23.274
He's out the front of Porky's.

26:23.274 --> 26:24.206
And I don't know
what it's about

26:24.206 --> 26:26.070
but it does sound
pretty serious.

26:38.842 --> 26:41.707
I swear to God, it
better be fucking important.

26:41.707 --> 26:42.466
Huh?

26:42.811 --> 26:45.434
Hah! Flicking your fingers
like a fucking King.

26:45.434 --> 26:46.643
What the fuck
are you talking about?

26:46.643 --> 26:47.678
You high again?

26:47.678 --> 26:48.817
What am I fucking
here for?

26:48.817 --> 26:49.922
You told me
to come down here.

26:49.922 --> 26:51.440
I didn't tell
you to come down here.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.925
You're being
fucking paranoid again.

26:52.925 --> 26:53.891
Do you hear this fuckwit?

26:53.891 --> 26:54.754
Will you stop
with the nose bags.

26:54.858 --> 26:55.617
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

26:55.755 --> 26:56.376
You're not
thinking straight.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.102
What the fuck
is wrong...

26:58.102 --> 26:59.345
Babe!

27:00.139 --> 27:02.210
Guess what I just did?

27:02.935 --> 27:04.350
Hope you
got a passport!

27:04.350 --> 27:05.282
John...

27:05.282 --> 27:06.835
We're
going to Athens!

27:06.835 --> 27:08.043
We?

27:09.666 --> 27:11.530
Wait a minute.
When did you do this?

27:11.530 --> 27:13.186
I bought
it earlier today.

27:13.186 --> 27:14.187
John!

27:35.208 --> 27:37.417
Fuck!

27:38.695 --> 27:39.523
Shit!

27:39.523 --> 27:42.595
Sam, hey, hey,
I got you. I got...

27:42.595 --> 27:44.355
Not me.

27:46.012 --> 27:47.600
Babe?!

27:49.637 --> 27:51.915
Fuck! Babe?

27:52.329 --> 27:53.951
Fuck! Not you, not you!

27:54.331 --> 27:57.714
Just breathe. It's okay.
I got you. Hey!

27:57.714 --> 27:59.301
I got you.

27:59.301 --> 28:01.614
Somebody get a
fucking ambulance!

28:01.614 --> 28:02.442
Fuck!

28:02.442 --> 28:04.134
Hey! Stay with me.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.690
Babe? Babe!

28:41.861 --> 28:43.622
Go home, brother.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.140
I got this.

28:48.385 --> 28:50.801
Huh?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.874
Just go home, go home.

28:54.874 --> 28:56.324
I'll find every
last one of them.

28:56.324 --> 28:58.050
I'll slit their
fucking throats.

28:58.050 --> 29:01.087
Go. Go to sleep,
when you wake up, it's done.

29:06.921 --> 29:08.992
We were this close, Sam.

29:09.889 --> 29:10.856
John.

29:14.376 --> 29:16.447
We were this close.

29:16.931 --> 29:18.898
To getting out.

29:25.594 --> 29:27.527
You can't help yourself.

29:37.365 --> 29:40.057
They killed her
in the street, John.

29:43.371 --> 29:46.201
Killed her like a dog.

29:53.243 --> 29:55.832
They didn't kill her, Sam.

29:58.489 --> 29:59.974
You did.

30:03.667 --> 30:05.427
You did.

30:57.307 --> 31:00.551
You hungry?
You need anything?

31:05.522 --> 31:08.905
No, mate, I'm all good.
You should go home.

31:09.906 --> 31:13.357
Maybe I'll hang around
and make some food,

31:13.357 --> 31:16.119
or you know... whatever.

31:22.332 --> 31:24.265
See you tomorrow.

31:26.957 --> 31:30.754
You know I love you, hey?
Hmm?

31:31.410 --> 31:33.584
Bye.

32:34.783 --> 32:37.752
I'm done.

32:40.065 --> 32:41.376
You win.

33:32.117 --> 33:33.152
They're expecting me.

33:43.576 --> 33:45.924
Without Ibrahims.

33:45.924 --> 33:48.167
Without Ibrahims.

33:49.582 --> 33:51.343
Sorry to crash your party.

33:52.654 --> 33:54.208
John?

33:54.829 --> 33:57.832
You dare come
in here uninvited?

33:57.832 --> 33:59.834
Delivering a message.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.561
Say what you have to say,
and then leave.

34:05.150 --> 34:06.565
This one's for you.

34:12.364 --> 34:14.297
You brought your war
to Kings Cross,

34:14.297 --> 34:15.608
now I'm bringing it here.

34:16.989 --> 34:18.853
I thought you
were smarter than this John.

34:18.853 --> 34:20.337
This is something your
brother would do!

34:20.337 --> 34:21.407
You mention my
brother's name again,

34:21.407 --> 34:23.444
you'll see how
fucking similar we are.

34:25.860 --> 34:27.448
Kill him! Kill him!

34:32.280 --> 34:36.284
Whatever happens,
I'm taking you with me.

34:37.458 --> 34:39.425
Oh, oh, shh, shh.

34:39.425 --> 34:42.911
Calm down, calm down.
Calm down.

34:42.911 --> 34:44.879
Or I fucking finish you here.

34:44.879 --> 34:47.123
Going to take my
brother now, eh?

34:51.920 --> 34:53.405
Good.

34:54.371 --> 34:58.444
Come on Johnny.
Come brother, it's okay.

35:08.972 --> 35:10.525
Where the fuck
did you come from?

35:10.525 --> 35:12.079
I knew you'd do
something like this.

35:13.528 --> 35:15.530
Hey! Where are
you going? John?

35:15.530 --> 35:17.015
I don't know.

35:29.406 --> 35:33.203
War! He does not know what
the meaning of it is yet.

35:33.203 --> 35:35.826
I'll take care of him, and
his brother. Both of them.

35:35.826 --> 35:37.311
We don't have to worry.

36:21.665 --> 36:22.839
John?

36:22.839 --> 36:24.151
You still got
mates in the press?

36:24.461 --> 36:26.049
Yeah, what do you need?

36:26.394 --> 36:28.189
I think it's time
we cleaned house.

36:28.569 --> 36:29.604
Yep.

36:58.323 --> 36:59.669
Ezra.

37:02.050 --> 37:03.362
You might want to read that.

37:38.432 --> 37:40.019
Possum!

37:45.301 --> 37:46.957
Possum!

37:47.958 --> 37:49.374
Possum?

37:49.374 --> 37:50.789
Are you in there?

37:54.344 --> 37:55.621
Possum!

37:55.621 --> 37:58.624
There you are!
What are you doing...

38:14.122 --> 38:16.124
The former
Senator is believed

38:16.124 --> 38:18.610
to have left a suicide note,
admitting his involvement

38:18.610 --> 38:21.889
with high-level corruption and
links to organised crime.

38:23.097 --> 38:25.686
It's understood he has
made serious allegations

38:25.686 --> 38:27.895
against a number of
senior police officers,

38:27.895 --> 38:30.863
including Assistant
Commissioner Bill Allen.

38:30.863 --> 38:34.108
Senator Calandro's name has
been linked to Kings Cross

38:34.108 --> 38:35.799
real-estate baron
Ezra Shipman...

38:36.731 --> 38:37.801
...and a series of

38:37.801 --> 38:40.494
controversial developmental approvals.

38:40.494 --> 38:42.841
Calandro has always
strenuously denied

38:42.841 --> 38:44.049
any involvement.

38:44.049 --> 38:47.052
An ICAC investigation into
the matter was cut short

38:47.052 --> 38:51.332
when the key witness died
in mysterious circumstances.

38:51.332 --> 38:53.369
The Assistant Commissioner's
shock arrest

38:53.369 --> 38:54.749
comes on the back of the death

38:54.749 --> 38:56.510
of long-serving
state politician

38:56.510 --> 38:59.029
and former Senator
Paul Calandro.

38:59.754 --> 39:00.997
Calandro was found dead

39:00.997 --> 39:03.931
in his Cammeray home late
yesterday after allegations

39:03.931 --> 39:06.589
were made against him
of high-level corruption

39:06.589 --> 39:08.591
and links to organised crime.

39:09.626 --> 39:10.903
Shit backhand.

39:12.077 --> 39:13.768
Unconfirmed
reports say that a note

39:13.768 --> 39:16.081
found with the dead man named
Assistant Commissioner Allen

39:16.081 --> 39:18.014
and real-estate mogul
Ezra Shipman.

39:18.014 --> 39:19.257
What are you doing here?

39:19.257 --> 39:21.880
Came to check in on ya.
See if you're all right.

39:21.880 --> 39:22.708
Yeah.

39:25.021 --> 39:27.368
You been listening
to that bullocks?

39:27.368 --> 39:28.231
Yep.

39:28.231 --> 39:30.647
Fuck it, amateur hour.

39:31.648 --> 39:33.029
Yeah.

40:01.713 --> 40:04.440
This is all a bit
cloak and dagger, isn't it?

40:04.440 --> 40:06.234
Tricky times.

40:08.202 --> 40:09.928
You want to tell me
what's going on?

40:10.584 --> 40:12.033
Why am I here?

40:16.521 --> 40:18.385
So you're not there.

40:21.284 --> 40:22.837
Right.

40:24.460 --> 40:25.771
Fuck.

40:46.689 --> 40:48.760
...arson squad
detectives are currently

40:48.760 --> 40:50.555
combing through the wreckage

40:50.555 --> 40:53.316
of the popular Golden Lantern restaurant.

40:53.316 --> 40:55.560
Witnesses describe
several loud explosions,

40:55.560 --> 40:58.494
shortly after midnight, by
the time fire crews arrived,

40:58.494 --> 41:01.082
the building was
engulfed in flames.

41:01.082 --> 41:03.982
Tragically, several
bodies have been located

41:03.982 --> 41:05.052
in the rear of the club,

41:05.052 --> 41:08.883
including the owner
identified as Li Xiangshen,

41:08.883 --> 41:11.092
in what appears to be
a targeted blaze.

41:38.879 --> 41:40.708
Yeah? Yes, this is Doyle.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.642
He's what?

41:44.678 --> 41:47.991
There's no sign of
forced entry, no struggle.

41:47.991 --> 41:50.649
Point 45 with his prints all
over it.

41:50.649 --> 41:52.375
Maybe he finally did
what everyone's

41:52.375 --> 41:54.481
been too scared to do
for all these years.

41:56.310 --> 41:57.829
Ezra Shipman?

41:57.829 --> 41:59.037
Oh yeah, it's possible.

41:59.037 --> 42:01.936
It's, it's bullshit.
It's a fucking hit!

42:02.799 --> 42:04.525
Liz!

42:04.525 --> 42:07.045
Calandro, Allen,
Li and now this!

42:07.045 --> 42:09.185
Someone's cleaning house,
and you fucking know it.

42:09.185 --> 42:12.430
Who cares? Look we've barely
been able to get our hands

42:12.430 --> 42:15.225
on this bloke and now
he's gone, all right?

42:15.225 --> 42:16.710
I'll take the win either way.

42:16.710 --> 42:18.159
Shit.

42:20.058 --> 42:22.060
For fuck's sake.

42:33.347 --> 42:37.351
Hello mate.
I've been looking for ya.

43:12.317 --> 43:14.802
I'm surprised to find you
here all alone.

43:17.046 --> 43:18.634
Not in the mood to party?

43:20.221 --> 43:21.084
Honestly?

43:23.535 --> 43:25.433
I don't know what
I'd be celebrating.

43:45.143 --> 43:46.800
Hey! Where's John?

43:49.941 --> 43:51.701
You did the work for me.

43:52.771 --> 43:57.189
Ezra Shipman.
Calandro. Bill Allen.

43:57.914 --> 44:00.296
Only left Li,
for me to mop up.

44:00.538 --> 44:04.542
Honestly? I thought you'd
put up more of a fight.

44:06.198 --> 44:07.959
I'm not used
to fighting women.

44:07.959 --> 44:11.376
Where I'm from, we learn
at a very young age

44:11.376 --> 44:14.241
to always let the man
think that he's in charge.

44:14.413 --> 44:16.623
It makes destroying him
much easier.

44:21.593 --> 44:24.838
In my culture,
we fight with this.

44:26.080 --> 44:29.877
In yours,
you fight with this.

44:31.707 --> 44:33.329
Look at Sam.

44:33.329 --> 44:35.676
After everything
that he's done to you,

44:35.676 --> 44:37.920
I would've cut
him off years ago.

44:38.368 --> 44:39.956
Anyone would.

44:40.370 --> 44:41.924
But not you.

44:42.269 --> 44:43.684
You can't choose your family.

44:46.998 --> 44:50.208
Sam broke everything
that you ever built.

44:51.174 --> 44:54.315
Destroyed everything
that you ever loved.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.111
And you still can't
turn your back on him.

45:17.028 --> 45:19.547
Hey! Police!
Don't fucking move!

45:19.547 --> 45:22.205
Don't fucking move!
Put the weapon down.

45:22.205 --> 45:24.622
Drop the weapon now, Sam!

45:25.001 --> 45:26.520
I heard what she said.

45:26.520 --> 45:27.417
I'll shoot.

45:27.417 --> 45:29.109
- It's not true.
- Yes it is.

45:29.109 --> 45:30.420
Now!

45:31.042 --> 45:33.941
Sam, drop the
fucking gun now!

45:34.183 --> 45:35.529
I'm sorry, John.

45:35.529 --> 45:37.324
Drop it!

45:39.119 --> 45:42.053
Hands in the air.
Hands in the air!

45:42.053 --> 45:43.675
On your knees.

45:46.471 --> 45:47.852
Hands behind your head.

46:25.579 --> 46:27.029
Sam was
charged with the murder

46:27.029 --> 46:31.067
of Vietnamese gang boss,
Tran Cat Tien.

46:31.067 --> 46:34.208
Luckily for him,
Liz Doyle made a statement

46:34.208 --> 46:36.245
arguing self-defence,

46:36.245 --> 46:38.626
and the charge was downgraded.

46:41.043 --> 46:43.562
John refused to make
a statement at all.

46:43.562 --> 46:44.978
No surprise.

46:44.978 --> 46:47.566
He'd made a career out
of not talking to cops.

46:47.566 --> 46:49.741
He walked away a free man,

46:49.741 --> 46:52.813
but he had much more to
worry about than the law.

46:52.813 --> 46:54.919
He'd paid a high price to be,

46:54.919 --> 46:57.197
the last King of the Cross.

I'm going. I'm just...
