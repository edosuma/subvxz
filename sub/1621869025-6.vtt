12:12.691 --> 12:14.192

Adam's sweatshirt

12:14.192 --> 12:15.694

12:15.694 --> 12:16.903
Yeah.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.200
He had donated it to Goodwill.

12:22.200 --> 12:24.661
And that's how I had it.

12:24.661 --> 12:28.415
And then I just made him swear
not to tell anyone anything.

12:29.708 --> 12:32.127
Why would you do that?
She gave you shit for weeks.

12:32.127 --> 12:33.712

than people knowing

you would never be so stupid.

- Not really.
