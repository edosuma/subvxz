00:15.483 --> 00:18.219
Darling, are you okay?

00:18.219 --> 00:20.488
Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.323
[Nadja]
<i>Something is wrong with Laszlo.</i>

00:22.323 --> 00:24.492
It has been like this
a few weeks now.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.528
<i>He just sits in the library,
staring off into space.</i>

00:27.528 --> 00:29.230
I have never seen him
like this before.

00:29.230 --> 00:32.233
Ah, Laszlo,
I've just been reading this book

00:32.233 --> 00:34.268
about the Battle
Of Quiberon Bay.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.203
Could you explain to me
the difference between

00:36.203 --> 00:40.074
an Endymion-class frigate
and a brigantine?

00:40.074 --> 00:42.944
Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

00:42.944 --> 00:44.812
[Nadja]
<i>I fear I am to blame.</i>

00:44.812 --> 00:46.514
Laszlo is so worried
about this hex

00:46.514 --> 00:48.282
that is ruining my eternal life

00:48.282 --> 00:50.251
that he is emotionally depleted.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.786
[Nandor]
<i>Sadly, I think it is</i>

00:51.786 --> 00:53.888
because
his world has been rocked

00:53.888 --> 00:56.490
by the fact
that I am in such a good place.

00:56.490 --> 00:59.794
Actually,
I keep having these dreams

00:59.794 --> 01:02.430
where I'm a small child,

01:02.430 --> 01:05.266
and Laszlo is... my daddy.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.202
Oh, that is actually because
that did happen, Colin Robinson.

01:08.202 --> 01:11.339
I think I would remember
Laszlo wiping my bottom.

01:11.339 --> 01:12.907
- [chuckles]
- It's 'cause he did.

01:12.907 --> 01:14.308
Though, to be fair, that...

01:14.308 --> 01:16.344
that is what's happening

01:16.344 --> 01:18.212
- in-in the dream.
- Ew.
- Please stop.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.814
[quietly]
Laszlo?

01:19.814 --> 01:21.148
Laszlo?

01:21.148 --> 01:22.917
Yeah, it's my fault.

01:22.917 --> 01:24.285
<i>Laszlo's been working so hard
to figure out</i>

01:24.285 --> 01:25.953
<i>why I'm not
a full vampire yet.</i>

01:25.953 --> 01:27.989
<i>- And Laszlo hates defeat, so,</i>
- [groaning]

01:27.989 --> 01:29.290
I think it's broken his brain.

01:29.290 --> 01:30.257
[whispering]
Laszlo, I just want you

01:30.257 --> 01:31.425
to know that it's okay.

01:31.425 --> 01:32.927
- You did your best.
- Gizmo?

01:32.927 --> 01:35.029
Ah. Yes.
Yes, I'm here for you.

01:35.029 --> 01:36.330
Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

01:36.330 --> 01:39.033
[Nadja]
<i>Even his libido is out of whack.</i>

01:39.033 --> 01:42.069
I mean, we are down to, like,
only 16 fucks a week.

01:42.069 --> 01:44.238
We are down to just three.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.375
I can't even get enough
of a rise out of him

01:47.375 --> 01:48.909
<i>for a mini-drain.</i>

01:48.909 --> 01:50.811
Oh, good Lord. Ooh!

01:50.811 --> 01:54.949
Does the limited warranty cover
the power cord, or just

01:54.949 --> 01:57.218
- the main unit itself?
- Ooh, I have been
hammering so hard

01:57.218 --> 01:59.754
- on these big nails.
- Good one, Jimbo.
You got me there.

01:59.754 --> 02:01.789
- Yeah, no, I'd love
to go on hold. Sure.
- Ooh. Ooh.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.291
- [Muzak plays over phone]
- Let's pound some rivets, baby.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.992
[Nandor]
Look what I found.

02:04.992 --> 02:07.094
A big box of ships
and pornography.

02:07.094 --> 02:09.229
Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

just stupid people. [groans]

02:51.739 --> 02:53.341
What do we know about Laszlo?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.242
[Nadja]
Guillermo, you spend

02:55.242 --> 02:58.045
a lot of your life
being very miserable and sad.

02:58.045 --> 03:00.081
Do you have any ideas?

03:00.081 --> 03:03.117
- Okay.
- Is it all right
if I pitch an idea?

03:03.117 --> 03:06.954
What about
if we threw Laszlo a roast?

03:06.954 --> 03:10.391
Right? Where we all give
funny speeches about Laszlo,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.059
kind of tease him a little bit,

03:12.059 --> 03:14.328
and it just makes him so happy
for some reason?

hear me out on this--

what if we threw Laszlo a roast?

[Nadja]
Love that idea!

03:26.741 --> 03:29.176
Now, this is an idea I like!

03:29.176 --> 03:31.979
- [laughing] I just said that.
- [Nandor] How did you
think of that?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.447
- [Guide] I said it so loud.
- [Nadja] Well done, Colin.

03:35.015 --> 03:38.051
No peeking, cheeky.

Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the official roast

03:56.404 --> 04:00.508
Yes, Laszlo,
this night is for you.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.410
Just look at this crowd!

04:02.410 --> 04:05.246
- [laughs]
- We gathered all

04:05.246 --> 04:09.250
the people that love you
into this one room.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.185
And then when we saw
all the empty chairs,

04:11.185 --> 04:14.088
we decided to drag some randos
in off the street to fill them!

04:14.088 --> 04:16.791
- [drum plays rim shot]
- [laughter]

04:16.791 --> 04:20.962
So many illustrious guests
here on the dais tonight.

04:20.962 --> 04:23.030
And also Colin Robinson.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.268
He got me. I got got.

04:27.268 --> 04:30.037
Our neighbor Sean is here.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.873
- Hey-yo! [laughs]
- [Nandor] Don't worry.
we hypnotized him

04:32.873 --> 04:35.810
so he's not gonna remember
anything tomorrow.

04:35.810 --> 04:38.179
- Seanie.
- Seanie.

04:38.179 --> 04:42.283
I see the great Baron Afanas
is here this evening,

04:42.283 --> 04:46.921
restored to his original
splendor, thank goodness.

04:46.921 --> 04:49.857
For a couple of years,
the baron looked a lot like

04:49.857 --> 04:53.194
if George Hamilton had had sex
with some pork rinds.

04:53.194 --> 04:55.196
- [rim shot]
- [laughter]

04:55.196 --> 04:58.298
- Hmm.
- I see that The Guide
is also here.

05:01.568 --> 05:05.006
So, everyone, please join me

05:05.006 --> 05:07.074
in saluting the man of the hour,

05:07.074 --> 05:10.011
the one, the only
Laszlo Cravensworth.

- [applause]

05:11.412 --> 05:13.748
We've known each other
so many, many years,

05:13.748 --> 05:15.216
you know.

05:15.216 --> 05:17.852
We can practically finish
each other's hand jobs.

05:17.852 --> 05:19.453
- [rim shot]
- [laughter]
- Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.155
We are just getting started.
It is your roast.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.157
A one, a two,
a one, two, three, four.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.992
- [lively jazz playing]
- It's Laszlo's roast.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.261
- It is his...
- [all] Roast.

05:27.261 --> 05:29.163
- It's Laszlo's...
- [all] Roast!

05:29.163 --> 05:30.864
We'll be back right after this.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.805
If you think
the missionary position involves

05:37.805 --> 05:39.073
lying on top of a missionary,

05:39.073 --> 05:42.243
you might be
a Laszlo Cravensworth!

05:42.243 --> 05:44.779
- [laughter]
- [rim shot]
- If the first thing

05:44.779 --> 05:47.448
you look for
in a woman is your dick,

05:47.448 --> 05:49.183
you might just be...

05:49.183 --> 05:51.786
a Laszlo Cravensworth!

05:51.786 --> 05:53.521
- [rim shot]
- [laughter]
- [man] Hey!

05:53.521 --> 05:56.257
If you think ejaculating
onto the pillow counts

05:56.257 --> 06:00.094
as "cooking your wife dinner,"
you might just be...

06:00.094 --> 06:02.396
[all]
A Laszlo Cravensworth.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.465
- [band plays]
- [laughter]

06:04.465 --> 06:06.767
- Women <i>can</i> be funny.
- [band stops playing]

06:08.502 --> 06:09.971
- [glass breaking]
- Ooh.

06:09.971 --> 06:12.239
Some describe Laszlo

06:12.239 --> 06:15.042
as a man of arts and letters.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.844
[quiet laughter]

06:16.844 --> 06:19.847
I can think of a couple
of letters to describe Laszlo.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.883
"F" and "W."

06:23.951 --> 06:28.322
Uh, no, not "W." Uh, "U."

06:28.322 --> 06:30.858
- [rim shot]
- Sorry. It was supposed
to be "F" and...

06:30.858 --> 06:32.927
- [rim shot]
- I think I'm just going

06:32.927 --> 06:34.929
to tell a story.

06:34.929 --> 06:38.065
A story called
"The Aristocrats."

06:38.065 --> 06:41.802
Ah, shit. Oh, I wasn't supposed
to say the name till the end.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.471
Forget I said the name of it.

06:43.471 --> 06:46.774
Um, anyway, a father,
a mother, a son

06:46.774 --> 06:50.978
and a daughter walk
into a talent agent's office.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.913
And the... the father says,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.483
"Boy, have I got an act
for you!"

06:55.483 --> 07:00.221
Uh, and the talent agent says,
"Well, let's see it then."

07:00.221 --> 07:02.923
Oh, and-and
there's a... a dog.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.860
Uh, the family dog.
That's important to note.

07:05.860 --> 07:07.995
- [lively jazz playing]
- [applause]

07:07.995 --> 07:11.465
- [rim shot]
- Up next, we have a man

07:11.465 --> 07:16.470
who knows more about roasting
than his beloved Arby's.

07:16.470 --> 07:18.306
- [rim shot]
- [scattered laughter]

07:18.306 --> 07:21.442
- Hmm?
- When this guy starts
roasting a vampire,

07:21.442 --> 07:24.845
you better bring a bun,
and also some ketchup.

07:24.845 --> 07:27.448
- [rim shot]
- [laughter]
- I don't get it.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.851
[Guide] <i>I did whisper
to the baron that</i>

07:30.851 --> 07:33.054
it was Guillermo
who opened the door

07:33.054 --> 07:36.357
<i>that let the sun come in to burn
his body into bits, you know,</i>

07:36.357 --> 07:38.059
<i>a few years ago because</i>

07:38.059 --> 07:39.994
he didn't know
what the joke was.

07:39.994 --> 07:42.463
<i>And I was trying to help him,
'cause being left out of a joke,</i>

07:42.463 --> 07:43.998
it sucks.

07:43.998 --> 07:45.933
[Nandor]
So give it up for an expert

07:45.933 --> 07:47.868
on raking 'em over the coals,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.170
or should I say the foyer rug...

07:49.170 --> 07:50.504
- Okay, okay. Thank you.
- [rim shot]

07:50.504 --> 07:52.073
[Guide]
<i>And then I did also mention</i>

07:52.073 --> 07:53.975
that Guillermo had
Van Helsing lineage.

07:53.975 --> 07:56.210
<i>That one just slipped out.</i>

07:56.210 --> 08:00.448
So, we are all here tonight
to honor Laszlo Cravensworth.

08:00.448 --> 08:03.451
Cravensworth? I'm more like,

08:03.451 --> 08:05.920
Cravensworth-less.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.455
- [rimshot]
- [laughter]

08:07.455 --> 08:09.991
Might I say a word or two?

08:09.991 --> 08:12.193
Yes, absolutely, Baron.
Please vacate

08:12.193 --> 08:14.929
the microphone for the baron.
Please welcome a man

08:14.929 --> 08:18.933
who knows quite a lot
about... sick burns.

08:18.933 --> 08:22.069
[rim shots, laughter]

08:22.069 --> 08:23.971
Baron Afanas.

08:23.971 --> 08:27.007
- [music plays]
- [whooping, applause]

08:28.542 --> 08:31.379
Look at this festive assembly.

08:31.379 --> 08:33.781
All of us,
gathered here together,

08:33.781 --> 08:36.350
chuckling at jokes
and silliness.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.919
- [laughter]
- And jackanapery.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.321
[rim shots]

08:40.321 --> 08:42.990
I guess there's only one thing
left to say.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.960
What is this shit?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.528
- [rim shot]
- [laughter]

08:47.528 --> 08:49.096
[laughs] Very good.

08:49.096 --> 08:51.465
[Baron]
You call yourselves vampires?

08:51.465 --> 08:55.002
Bah. This entire evening
has been nothing but

08:55.002 --> 08:57.438
a pageant of insipid nonsense.

08:57.438 --> 08:59.307
[laughing] Yes.

08:59.307 --> 09:02.843
Worshipping at the altar
of your own mediocre frivolity.

09:02.843 --> 09:05.313
A jester's hollow dance.

09:05.313 --> 09:06.814
And who is laughing?

09:06.814 --> 09:08.316
Yeah! [whoops]

09:08.316 --> 09:10.518
[grunts]

09:10.518 --> 09:12.219
[Baron]
Vampires are supposed to have

09:12.219 --> 09:15.957
blood orgies
and slaughter circles.

09:15.957 --> 09:18.192
Gah! You have all gone soft.

09:18.192 --> 09:21.462
You even invited humans
to this asinine affair.

09:21.462 --> 09:22.930
All right, you know what?
Sean is cool.

09:22.930 --> 09:24.198
He's a good time.
I take that one back.

09:24.198 --> 09:26.467
But everything else is
an embarrassment

09:26.467 --> 09:28.869
to the very word "vampire."

09:29.937 --> 09:31.372
[Nandor]
Baron, we just were

09:31.372 --> 09:33.808
trying to, you know,
cheer up Laszlo a bit.

09:33.808 --> 09:36.077
He just hasn't
been himself lately.

09:36.077 --> 09:39.347
Vampires do not need
cheering up!

09:39.347 --> 09:42.249
- [electrical hissing
and popping]
- We vampires

09:42.249 --> 09:44.452
are not cheerful creatures.

09:44.452 --> 09:47.822
We sit, and we brood,
for centuries on end,

09:47.822 --> 09:51.459
plotting the demise of our foes
and innocent bystanders alike!

09:51.459 --> 09:54.328
- Oh, okay, I guess we didn't
really see it like that--
- Uh!

09:54.328 --> 09:56.797
- [Nadja whimpers]
- And the worst part?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.333
I find out only tonight

09:59.333 --> 10:01.102
that you have all been keeping

10:01.102 --> 10:04.338
secrets around here,
have you not?

10:04.338 --> 10:09.477
For years, I now know
that you have been harboring

10:09.477 --> 10:13.247
- a vampire killer...
- [all gasping]

10:13.247 --> 10:15.950
...right here
under your own roof...

10:15.950 --> 10:17.451
Uh...

10:17.451 --> 10:21.088
...who, in fact,
tried to kill me.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.957
- [gasping]
- What? What vampire--

10:22.957 --> 10:24.925
Do not insult my intelligence!

10:24.925 --> 10:28.762
So, vampire killer.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.802
Do you have anything
to say for yourself?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.170
Well, I, uh--

10:36.170 --> 10:38.439
It doesn't matter
what you have to say! Seize him!

10:38.439 --> 10:40.508
- Run!
- [growling]

10:40.508 --> 10:42.777
[audience exclaiming]

10:42.777 --> 10:44.811
[panting]

10:46.880 --> 10:48.916
[growling]

10:51.285 --> 10:53.788
Baron, show him mercy!

10:53.788 --> 10:56.323
Let us give you
the very simple explanation!

11:00.861 --> 11:03.163
[panting]

11:04.999 --> 11:06.801
- Guillermo.
- Guillermo.

11:06.801 --> 11:07.968
- Are-are you o--
- [Nadja squeals]

11:08.769 --> 11:10.972
- [Nadja coughing] Behind you.
- What?

11:10.972 --> 11:12.773
[coughing]

11:12.773 --> 11:14.508
[gasps]

11:14.508 --> 11:16.377
- [Nadja] Ooh.
- [Nandor] Laszlo?

11:16.377 --> 11:19.513
- Laszlo!
- Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.850
[grunting]

11:22.850 --> 11:24.819
[panting]

11:24.819 --> 11:26.753
[Baron groaning]

11:33.260 --> 11:35.196
Baron, stop!

11:35.196 --> 11:37.932
- It was just a mix-em-up!
- [Nadja] A whoopsie-daisy!

11:37.932 --> 11:39.533
- [Nandor yells]
- Stay out of this!

11:39.533 --> 11:40.901
[both yelling]

11:42.303 --> 11:43.471
[grunts]

11:43.471 --> 11:46.307
[car alarm sounding]

11:46.307 --> 11:47.975
[growling]

11:47.975 --> 11:50.410
[grunting]

11:52.279 --> 11:54.215
[Baron] Gah!

11:54.215 --> 11:56.450
- [car thudding]
- [glass breaking]

11:56.450 --> 11:58.252
- Don't film this.
- [Nandor] Okay.

11:58.252 --> 12:00.187
- Hey, guys.
- Not now!

12:00.187 --> 12:01.989
Oh, I just wanted
to take a quick moment

12:01.989 --> 12:03.991
to apologize
for telling the baron

12:03.991 --> 12:06.060
that it was Guillermo
who burned him to a crisp.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.828
- Not now.
- That's on me.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.030
- [Nandor] Are you done?
- [Guide] Sorry.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.967
You know what, Nandor? I think
let's just sit this one out.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.802
Let them two sort it out
between themselves.

12:14.802 --> 12:15.836
[Baron grunts]

12:15.836 --> 12:16.804
- [Nandor gasps]
- Hmm?

12:16.804 --> 12:18.439
- Ah...
- [grunts]

12:18.439 --> 12:21.809
You are forgetting that
Guillermo is a vampire killer.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.444
Which means he could kill
the baron.

12:23.444 --> 12:25.913
We are direct descendants
of the baron's vampiric line,

12:25.913 --> 12:27.481
which means we would all die.

12:27.481 --> 12:29.917
[Nadja] Maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad thing

12:29.917 --> 12:31.185
- if we ended up dying?
- [Nandor] Wh... Are you okay?

12:31.185 --> 12:32.787
Yeah.

12:32.787 --> 12:34.789
I've just been going
through a lot lately.

12:34.789 --> 12:36.824
- [groans]
- [Nadja] So... Fine.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.760
if we want to live, then yes,
I do have a plan.

12:44.999 --> 12:46.934
Guillermo? [groans]

12:46.934 --> 12:48.469
Nadja, anything?

12:48.469 --> 12:49.971
No!

12:49.971 --> 12:51.772
- No sign of Gizmo or the baron.
- [groans]

12:51.772 --> 12:53.307
Wait. Hang on. Hey!

12:53.307 --> 12:55.476
- Come here, you little shit!
- [groans]

12:55.476 --> 12:56.844
[Nandor] Shit.

12:56.844 --> 12:58.112
- What?
- [Nadja] I got him!

12:58.112 --> 12:59.180
Meet me out front!

12:59.180 --> 13:02.816
She's got him! I'm coming!

13:04.351 --> 13:07.455
- You got Guillermo?
- No. The baron.

13:07.455 --> 13:09.523
Are you telling me
Baron Afanas cannot fight

13:09.523 --> 13:11.192
his way out of a burlap sack?

13:11.192 --> 13:12.493
I think he's injured.

13:12.493 --> 13:14.462
We had quite the scuffle
in there. [laughs]

13:14.462 --> 13:16.063
[Guillermo]
How badly is he hurt?

13:16.063 --> 13:17.465
- [Nandor] There you are.
- Because if he dies...

13:17.465 --> 13:18.866
- Yes, we know.
- [Nadja] Oh, shut up, Guillermo.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.801
[Baron]
Guillermo, help me.

13:20.801 --> 13:24.372
These two imbeciles,
they are trying to kill me.

13:24.372 --> 13:26.907
You know, if you help
the baron, he might forgive you.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.945
Yeah. Okay, Baron.
I want to help you.

13:30.945 --> 13:33.214
- But you have to promise
not to hurt me.
- [Baron] Yes.

13:33.214 --> 13:35.049
- I promise. Please.
- Okay, then.

13:35.049 --> 13:36.517
Let's just get you out of here.
You're gonna be safe.

13:36.517 --> 13:38.519
- And... [groans]
- [electricity buzzing]

13:38.519 --> 13:41.088
- [laughing]
- All right, dudes.

13:41.088 --> 13:42.089
Now what?

13:42.089 --> 13:43.924
Yoo-hoo?

13:43.924 --> 13:45.326
Baron?

13:45.326 --> 13:47.528
We've got the little
motherfucker, Baron!

13:47.528 --> 13:49.329
- [gasps]
- [shrieks]

13:50.297 --> 13:51.399
Nicely done.

13:51.399 --> 13:53.267
And now? Leave him to me.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.836
Baron, we ask that you show
Guillermo mercy.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.938
- [groaning]
- No! Ow.

14:02.476 --> 14:04.077
What is the meaning of this?

14:05.212 --> 14:06.948
- Sorry.
- Terribly.

14:06.948 --> 14:08.783
[roaring]

14:08.783 --> 14:11.118
[Nandor] So,
to review again, Baron...

14:11.118 --> 14:13.120
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you agree that

14:13.120 --> 14:15.222
when Guillermo opened the door

14:15.222 --> 14:17.191
and fried you by the sun,

14:17.191 --> 14:20.194
he did not know that you were
inside at the time?

14:20.194 --> 14:21.929
I do.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.364
Great. And, Guillermo,

14:23.364 --> 14:26.000
you accept,
even though it was an accident,

14:26.000 --> 14:29.437
that the baron has every right
to be very mad

14:29.437 --> 14:32.206
at the fact that
he got fried by the sun?

14:32.206 --> 14:33.841
I-I do.

14:33.841 --> 14:36.177
I will accept your apology
if you will accept

14:36.177 --> 14:38.779
- the fact that I'm still
going to kill you.
- [Guillermo] What?

14:38.779 --> 14:41.115
- No. No.
- Guillermo, he is trying to
meet you in the middle here.

14:41.115 --> 14:44.218
- Come on.
- It's like he doesn't even want
this to be resolved.

14:44.218 --> 14:46.187
By my killing him.

14:46.187 --> 14:47.855
No, I do want this
to be resolved, but--

14:47.855 --> 14:49.457
Okay, you know what?
Let's take a hard five.

14:49.457 --> 14:52.893
Guillermo, I will take a carafe
of your finest blood.

14:54.094 --> 14:57.097
Ah, yes. Okay.
I will fetch.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.200
Baron Afanas?

14:59.200 --> 15:01.234
Yes, snake?

15:02.870 --> 15:05.806
I can't help
my vampire hunter lineage,

15:05.806 --> 15:08.376
but I want you to know
that I have renounced it.

15:08.376 --> 15:11.178
[huffs]
And how did you do this?

15:11.178 --> 15:14.181
[muttering] Guillermo?
This is dangerous territory.

15:14.181 --> 15:16.183
I...

15:16.183 --> 15:18.085
got turned into a vampire.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.320
You...

15:21.355 --> 15:23.791
...are a vampire?

15:23.791 --> 15:27.761
Guillermo is a vampire?
Did everybody else know this?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.465
Delicious. Ah!

15:31.465 --> 15:33.534
[laughs]

15:33.534 --> 15:37.905
Oh, such a flamboyant, perverse
betrayal of your own kind.

15:37.905 --> 15:40.241
Oh, I like it a lot.

15:40.241 --> 15:41.809
And kudos to Nandor.

15:41.809 --> 15:44.345
Mm? To turn a Van Helsing,

15:44.345 --> 15:47.081
a vampire killer,
into a vampire?

15:47.081 --> 15:49.050
Oh! Oh, that is a big get.
[chuckles]

15:49.050 --> 15:50.818
I must congratulate him
when he returns.

15:50.818 --> 15:51.852
[Guillermo]
Well, see, that's the thing.

15:51.852 --> 15:54.355
It wasn't Nandor that turned me.

15:54.355 --> 15:55.856
What?

15:55.856 --> 15:58.192
Oh, it was that vampire
named Derek.

15:58.192 --> 16:00.061
How could you do such a thing?

16:00.061 --> 16:01.329
I've just been
waiting for this a long time,

16:01.329 --> 16:03.831
and yeah,
it's still a bit sticky, but--

16:03.831 --> 16:05.533
Oh, "sticky"?

16:05.533 --> 16:09.002
I think it is a bit more
than just "sticky."

16:10.337 --> 16:13.174
It is a devastation.
A violation.

16:13.174 --> 16:15.076
A humiliation!

16:15.076 --> 16:18.045
A shame from which neither you
nor Nandor shall ever recover.

16:18.045 --> 16:20.081
I know, I know, and that's
exactly why I haven't told him.

16:20.081 --> 16:22.316
And I would appreciate it
if none of you

16:22.316 --> 16:23.918
tell him, either.

16:23.918 --> 16:25.953
You know me,
I'm-I'm like a vault...

16:25.953 --> 16:27.388
with stuff.

16:27.388 --> 16:30.825
Yeah, and I'm not gonna tell
anyone anything.

16:30.825 --> 16:33.127
In fact, I'd very much like

16:33.127 --> 16:36.831
to be excluded
from this narrative.

16:36.831 --> 16:39.333
Me, too. I should go.

16:39.333 --> 16:40.968
Guillermo, you and I?
We are good.

16:40.968 --> 16:42.803
- Oh.
- You all have
much graver matters

16:42.803 --> 16:44.472
to discuss here,

16:44.472 --> 16:47.775
and I want no part of
what might transpire if--

16:47.775 --> 16:51.312
Here we go!
Blood for the vampires.

16:51.312 --> 16:52.446
- Baron.
- Mm.

16:52.446 --> 16:55.449
And a flat Pepsi for Guillermo.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.052
- Thank you.
- So, what did I miss?

16:58.052 --> 16:59.120
Mm?

16:59.120 --> 17:01.322
Oh, Guillermo and I have

17:01.322 --> 17:03.924
called a truce.

17:03.924 --> 17:06.927
A truce? So, you are not
killing him, then?

17:06.927 --> 17:09.530
Well, I will not be the one

17:09.530 --> 17:12.133
to take this
familiar's life tonight.

17:12.133 --> 17:13.467
[Nandor]
Oh, that's great.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.935
Good to hear.

17:14.935 --> 17:17.038
So good, in fact,
I propose a toast.

17:17.038 --> 17:19.307
To the baron, to Guillermo,

17:19.307 --> 17:21.442
to the work
we have achieved tonight.

17:21.442 --> 17:22.743
Cheers!

17:24.144 --> 17:25.479
[exhales]

17:26.814 --> 17:27.782
- Oh, that's sweet.
- May I?

17:27.782 --> 17:28.815
Mm.

17:30.851 --> 17:34.454
If I could have a moment
alone with Guillermo?

17:36.223 --> 17:38.192
- Alone.
- Mm.

17:38.192 --> 17:39.794
Yeah, no, please.

17:39.794 --> 17:41.329
- Thank you, Nandor.
- Yes, thank you, Baron.

17:41.329 --> 17:43.264
Thank you.

17:43.264 --> 17:44.966
[sighs]

17:44.966 --> 17:49.036
Guillermo, vampire to vampire...

17:50.070 --> 17:51.939
A secret like this,

17:51.939 --> 17:54.475
it will not stay hidden forever.

17:54.475 --> 17:57.979
It is best that
Nandor hears it from you.

17:57.979 --> 17:59.914
- I know.
- Mm.

17:59.914 --> 18:01.916
But...

18:01.916 --> 18:03.985
what do you think he'll do?

18:03.985 --> 18:05.953
Probably kill you.

18:05.953 --> 18:07.822
Then himself.

18:07.822 --> 18:09.323
That is what I would do.

18:09.323 --> 18:12.326
- Right.
- Mm.

18:12.326 --> 18:14.962
You know, it's funny,
I did all this because

18:14.962 --> 18:17.965
I want to be a vampire,
a great vampire.

18:17.965 --> 18:20.935
- Like Nandor, like you.
- Oh...

18:20.935 --> 18:23.471
Your heart is
in the right place, my boy.

18:23.471 --> 18:26.440
And please know
that I am rooting for you, hmm?

18:26.440 --> 18:29.477
- To not get killed.
- Oh. Thank you.

18:29.477 --> 18:32.446
- But... these things happen.
- Well, I hope not.

18:32.446 --> 18:34.915
Can't afford another accident
on my watch.

18:34.915 --> 18:37.184
- [screams]
- No! No!

18:37.184 --> 18:39.320
- Guillermo, no! No, no!
- Ah, no! [crying]

18:39.320 --> 18:42.089
[Baron screaming]

18:48.095 --> 18:49.964
Well, things were almost okay.

18:49.964 --> 18:53.167
But now, not so much.
[chuckles nervously]

18:53.167 --> 18:56.103
As soon as the sun sets
and the baron is awoken,

18:56.103 --> 18:58.172
he is going to track
Guillermo down until he is

18:58.172 --> 18:59.941
very much, well...

18:59.941 --> 19:01.809
- Dead.
- Shut up.

19:01.809 --> 19:04.078
I'm sure he will be safe.

19:04.078 --> 19:05.846
And dead.

19:05.846 --> 19:08.950
- [thunder rumbles]
- [Nadja] <i>Sunset approaches.</i>

19:08.950 --> 19:12.453
Is it me, or does he look like
a shriveled-up nutsack?

19:12.453 --> 19:16.958
- [Nadja] Laszlo? Any ideas?
- Yes, yes, very good. Thank you.

19:16.958 --> 19:18.892
[clock chiming]

19:19.893 --> 19:20.961
[yawning]

19:23.230 --> 19:25.132
Oh, good evening.

19:25.132 --> 19:26.801
- Baron, listen. Guillermo is--
- Oh, where was I?

19:26.801 --> 19:29.503
Ah, yes.
About to kill Guillermo, yes.

19:29.503 --> 19:32.006
Baron, I... I beg mercy.

19:32.006 --> 19:34.909
I know that Guillermo has made
some mistakes.

19:34.909 --> 19:36.344
He nearly killed you twice.

19:36.344 --> 19:39.180
- Mm.
- And he's even massacred

19:39.180 --> 19:41.215
an entire theater of vampires.

19:41.215 --> 19:42.783
Wait, what?

19:42.783 --> 19:45.219
But he did so
to defend his master.

19:45.219 --> 19:47.488
Whatever Guillermo's
flaws may be,

19:47.488 --> 19:50.057
he has always been loyal to me.

19:50.057 --> 19:52.226
- Has he?
- Yes, Baron.

19:52.226 --> 19:53.961
Mm...

19:53.961 --> 19:55.529
Has he, though?

19:55.529 --> 19:57.465
Yes, Baron, he has.

19:57.465 --> 19:58.933
You are certain of--

19:58.933 --> 20:00.901
Yes! I-I am.

20:00.901 --> 20:03.504
Well, I would just say
it is complicated,

20:03.504 --> 20:06.340
but we can discuss this further
after I kill him, yes?

20:06.340 --> 20:09.410
Now, where would he run?

20:09.410 --> 20:10.745
[groans]

20:10.745 --> 20:13.147
I will need Guillermo's scent.

20:13.147 --> 20:14.749
- [sniffing]
- [Laszlo] I say, Baron,

20:14.749 --> 20:16.117
if you're looking for Gizmo,
he's not here.

20:16.117 --> 20:17.918
You'll find him
in the toolshed.

20:17.918 --> 20:19.453
That's where he goes
to hide and wank.

20:21.055 --> 20:22.256
Thank you.

20:22.256 --> 20:24.792
Why would you say that?

20:24.792 --> 20:26.494
Well, why delay the inevitable?

20:26.494 --> 20:29.297
Plus, I was sick of
hearing you lot waffle on.

20:29.297 --> 20:31.365
If you'll excuse me...

20:37.872 --> 20:39.273
[Nandor]
Guillermo!

20:40.808 --> 20:44.111
Well, at least he died
doing what he loved:

20:44.111 --> 20:46.113
beating off in the toolshed.

20:46.113 --> 20:48.983
Oh... [whimpers]

20:48.983 --> 20:51.919
Oh, no.

20:51.919 --> 20:53.921
Oh...

20:53.921 --> 20:57.491
Okay, now I'm starting
to feel a little bad.

20:57.491 --> 21:00.828
But on the bright side,
he-he was just a familiar.

21:00.828 --> 21:03.164
He was not just a familiar.

21:03.164 --> 21:05.099
He was my bodyguard.

21:05.099 --> 21:07.501
He was the best man
at my wedding.

21:07.501 --> 21:09.070
He was my friend.

21:09.070 --> 21:11.372
Okay, yes, yes.
It is all very sad.

21:11.372 --> 21:12.907
But I think we should now
get him in the ground

21:12.907 --> 21:14.408
before he starts to stink.

21:14.408 --> 21:18.178
Laszlo, can you come
and help carry this, please?

21:19.346 --> 21:21.749
- That's not Gizmo.
- What do you mean
it's not Gizmo?

21:21.749 --> 21:23.016
What I mean is...

21:24.018 --> 21:25.252
...it's not Gizmo.

21:25.252 --> 21:27.221
- What are you doing?
- Stand aside.

21:27.221 --> 21:28.823
[Nandor] Laszlo,
what are you doing?

21:28.823 --> 21:30.291
Laszlo, I do not think
we need to eat him.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.826
- [grunts]
- Ooh, yeesh!
- [Nandor] Stop that!

21:31.826 --> 21:33.327
Stop that!

21:33.327 --> 21:35.396
[Nadja and Nandor exclaim]

21:35.396 --> 21:36.864
[Guide] Eesh.

21:36.864 --> 21:38.199
[all exclaim]

21:38.199 --> 21:39.500
Does Gizmo have gills?

21:39.500 --> 21:41.068
- You mean lungs?
- [Laszlo] I mean gills.

21:41.068 --> 21:42.837
So he can breathe underwater.

21:42.837 --> 21:44.405
And does he have
an amphibious egg sac?

21:44.405 --> 21:47.375
- Maybe?
- He never said. Uh...
I never asked.

21:47.375 --> 21:49.377
He wore a lot of layers.

21:49.377 --> 21:51.445
It was hard to see what was
going on under all that.

21:51.445 --> 21:53.948
- [Guide] Oh!
- [Nandor] Oh! Why do his eyes
look like that?

21:53.948 --> 21:55.316
[Lazlo] It's not Gizmo.
It's a byproduct of

21:55.316 --> 21:58.352
my scientific experimentation
gone awry.

21:58.352 --> 22:00.788
So, where is
the real Guillermo, then?

22:00.788 --> 22:02.423
Fucked if I know.
Excuse me, my darling.

22:02.423 --> 22:05.026
- Hmm?
- [Baron] Ah, you know what?

22:05.026 --> 22:07.461
[groans] I will let him go.

22:07.461 --> 22:09.530
After all of that?

22:09.530 --> 22:12.199
I was going on and on
about all of you

22:12.199 --> 22:14.168

22:14.168 --> 22:16.003

22:17.404 --> 22:20.007
...it is I who have gone soft.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.742
- [Guide] What?
- No.

22:21.742 --> 22:24.879
- [Nandor] Ridiculous.
- Let us be candid here.

22:24.879 --> 22:28.215

New Jersey.

22:52.173 --> 22:56.010
At this point,
we are more like roommates
