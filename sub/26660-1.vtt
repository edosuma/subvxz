01:09.278 --> 01:11.863
But at least I have the decency
when I'm driving,

01:11.947 --> 01:14.575
to put my head out the window and go,

01:15.576 --> 01:17.244
"Sandman coming. Watch out."

01:18.203 --> 01:20.956
How about those Tesla's now

01:21.039 --> 01:22.457
Those Teslas, that's pretty cool.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.543
They can drive themselves. Holy shit, man.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.754
I got in an accident with a Tesla
and nobody was in there,

01:27.838 --> 01:30.966
and I didn't know who to exchange
the information with...

01:31.049 --> 01:34.344
and I started screaming,
"Hey, you fucker. What the fuck?"

01:34.428 --> 01:38.056
And the Tesla's, you know, fucking
windshield wipers are flappin' about.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.451
And I was like, "What the fuck
does that mean? You did it."

01:40.475 --> 01:42.603
And its fucking lights
are going on and off.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.105
Like it's saying, "Okay. All right."
And, uh...

01:45.188 --> 01:46.440
Then we go to court

and I'm like,
"I'm going to fucking destroy this thing."

01:49.151 --> 01:51.695
And then the Tesla shows up
in a neck brace,

01:51.778 --> 01:53.780
and I say, "Oh, give me a fucking break.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.788
you ring the doorbell and the guy answers,

02:42.871 --> 02:44.665
And then you go, "Oh, God. Okay."

02:44.748 --> 02:46.541

You're like, "Roll my pants up?"

He puts some grapes down,

He's like, "Making the wine!"

03:24.996 --> 03:27.749
Don't you put a lot of lotion
on your face out here in LA?

03:27.833 --> 03:31.044
My wife fucking
really lathers on the lotion.

03:31.128 --> 03:32.796
She always says she's looking out for me.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.924
She just puts a lot of lotion.
Like, there's too much.

03:36.007 --> 03:37.217
Doesn't rub it in either.

03:37.300 --> 03:39.761
She just puts it on my forehead,
my cheeks, my nose...

03:39.845 --> 03:41.805
Then I found out, before me,

03:41.888 --> 03:44.349
my wife used to date a lemon meringue pie.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.308
And I was like...

03:46.351 --> 03:49.229

04:09.916 --> 04:11.168
My father used to shave...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.711
My dad had a beard,

04:12.794 --> 04:15.338
and then, literally, every ten years
would shave his beard.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.550
Like, didn't ask us, just fucking
came out of nowhere, shaved.

04:18.632 --> 04:21.219
It was... Any time
my father shaved his beard,

04:21.303 --> 04:23.513
it was the only time
you saw him look vulnerable.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.974
When he first came out of the bathroom,
he was like...

04:30.437 --> 04:33.565
I was like, "Dad has dimples?"
I didn't know Dad had dimples."

04:36.943 --> 04:38.612
"It'll grow back."

04:39.196 --> 04:40.322
Why'd you do it?

04:41.740 --> 04:42.824
"I don't know.

04:44.534 --> 04:45.619
It was...

04:46.411 --> 04:47.411
It was itchy."

04:47.871 --> 04:49.915
"It's been itchy for ten fucking years?"

04:52.459 --> 04:55.670
I went to my friend's house
and he had a heated toilet seat.

04:56.254 --> 04:59.883
I sat on his heated toilet seat.
I've got to say it made you relax.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.177
I went a lot better than I usually go.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.239
I came out and said, "I like that heated
toilet seat. Where'd you get that?"

05:05.263 --> 05:07.057
He goes, "I don't have
a heated toilet seat."

05:09.142 --> 05:12.020
You ever walking down the street
and you say hi to a baby?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.479
And, uh...

05:14.147 --> 05:16.608
And the baby goes...

05:16.691 --> 05:18.610
And you're going, "Yeah, that's great."

05:18.693 --> 05:21.404
And then... And the mother goes,
"He can say 'hi' back."

05:21.488 --> 05:24.324
And you go, "Oh, yeah?"
And the kid goes...

05:24.407 --> 05:25.450
You go, "There it is."

05:25.534 --> 05:27.536
Then mother goes,
"No, he really can say it."

05:27.619 --> 05:30.288
And the kid goes...

05:30.372 --> 05:32.123
And you go, "Hey, that was great."

05:32.207 --> 05:33.927
The mother goes,
"No, he really can say it."

05:33.959 --> 05:35.961
And the kid goes...

05:36.044 --> 05:37.921
And you go,
"There it is. That was it, right?"

05:38.004 --> 05:40.423
And the mother's like,
"No! Say it. Say hi."

05:40.507 --> 05:42.259
And the kid's like...

05:42.342 --> 05:45.470
And... And then the mother's like,
"What the fuck? Say it!

05:45.554 --> 05:46.680
You said it earlier!"

05:46.763 --> 05:49.975
And the kid's like...

05:50.058 --> 05:52.954
And you're like, "Hey, that was
a full sentence. That's better than 'Hi'."

05:52.978 --> 05:56.648
And the mother's like, "What the...?
I'm so mad at you, baby!"

05:57.941 --> 06:01.027
And then she like hands you the baby
and is like, "I've got to walk this off.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.446
This is very discouraging for me.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.866
He said it earlier!"

06:05.949 --> 06:07.784
And you're holding the baby, like...

06:09.119 --> 06:11.621
"Say it. Go ahead and say it. Say, 'Hi'.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.790
Come on, you really upset your mother."

06:13.874 --> 06:15.417
And the kid's looking at you...

06:15.500 --> 06:18.712
And you're like, "Come on, get it out."
It's gonna make her feel better.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.549
And the kid's like...
And you're like, "You can do it. Come on."

06:22.632 --> 06:26.177
And the kid's like...

06:27.888 --> 06:28.972
"Help me.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.102
She... She...

06:34.686 --> 06:37.480
She won't let me get vaccinated."

06:39.524 --> 06:41.985
Come on, there's no proof
that that's good or bad yet.

we fool around pretty hardcore.

We go at a pretty good. It's fun.

07:44.047 --> 07:47.467
You know, it's nice. We love each other,
and we fucking go pretty hard and...

07:48.593 --> 07:51.846
It gets crazy.
It gets pretty fucking nuts in there

07:51.930 --> 07:53.570

07:55.976 --> 07:58.311
We do, uh... We do have a safe word.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.312
It's, "Really?"

08:02.399 --> 08:05.527
My whole life, I always wanted
to be able to do a flip.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.610
Wouldn't that be great?

08:06.653 --> 08:09.293
I was always growing up, going,
"Man, I've got to get a flip going.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.283
Everybody will love me
if I could just do a flip."

08:12.367 --> 08:14.786
Everybody would be like,
"Whoa, did you see the Sandman?

08:14.869 --> 08:16.371
He popped out a flip."

08:16.454 --> 08:19.457
I just wanted to be
in a fucking Marshalls or something,

08:19.541 --> 08:21.876
buying some cheap clothes
and going, "Hey, watch this."

08:21.960 --> 08:24.796
Pop a flip and have
the fucking lady at the cash register go,

08:24.879 --> 08:26.881
"Did you fucking see
that kid with the flip?"

08:26.965 --> 08:29.050
I'd be like. "Hey, I do it all the time."

08:29.134 --> 08:32.554
But I never got that one down, man.
I wish I did.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.347
Always I was like...
I didn't know how to fucking practice.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.599
That was the problem.

08:36.683 --> 08:41.062
I didn't know how to do my first try.
I would always get to right about here,

08:41.145 --> 08:43.231
and then go, "Ah, I don't know.
I'm gonna get hurt."

08:43.313 --> 08:46.192
And when I got older, I wanted to learn
how to speak fluent Italian too.

08:46.276 --> 08:47.777
And I did that. I mastered that.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.613
So, I'm in Italy,
and I meet the Pope himself,

08:50.697 --> 08:52.365
and in fluent Italian, I say to him,

08:52.449 --> 08:54.617
"Hey, I love what you've done
for the Church.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.828
I love what you you're doing
for the world.

08:56.911 --> 08:58.913
America says, 'Hello.'

08:58.997 --> 09:00.540
Um...

09:00.623 --> 09:02.167
Am I getting into heaven?"

09:02.250 --> 09:04.753
And in Italian he says,
"Can you do a flip?"

09:04.836 --> 09:07.714
And I was like, "Madonne!"

09:09.340 --> 09:10.800
Shit.

09:10.884 --> 09:13.595
Did you ever have a friend
who rescues too many animals

09:13.678 --> 09:15.305
and, like, never can do anything?

09:15.388 --> 09:17.557
"Hey, you want to go out
in a couple days?"

09:17.640 --> 09:19.642
"Ah, no, my chicken's eye fell out

09:19.726 --> 09:22.353
and I've got to paste it back on."

09:22.437 --> 09:24.272
"Oh, okay. That shouldn't take that long."

09:24.355 --> 09:27.108
"Well, one of the ducks,
she isn't quacking, so...

09:28.276 --> 09:29.694
I've got to look...

09:29.778 --> 09:31.654
I've got to look into that."

09:36.534 --> 09:37.952
Okay.

09:38.953 --> 09:39.954
Dling!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.457
By the way, I never met this man.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.837
Uh, this one is
kind of a Bee Gee-esque tune.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.964
Kind of a...
You like the Bee Gees out there?

09:50.048 --> 09:51.966

Hello.

21:24.617 --> 21:25.617
You ever...

21:26.035 --> 21:27.620
How about the times you wake up...

21:27.703 --> 21:29.455
Ever wake up like 4:30 in the morning

21:29.538 --> 21:32.166
and you're like, "God damn it.
What am I doing up right now?"

21:32.249 --> 21:34.001
4:30, can't fall asleep...

21:34.084 --> 21:35.753
I'm fucking ruined for the day.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.636
Ever do one of those things where you go,
"Let me just get out of bed,"

21:38.714 --> 21:42.051
and live like those people who always go,
"Hey, I get up at 4:30 every day.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.844
I do that for me. That's me time.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.471
I spend the morning alone.

21:45.554 --> 21:48.808
That's my time and it's the best.
It sets me in the right mood."

21:48.891 --> 21:50.935
You're like, "Let me be
one of those fucking pricks.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.394
I'll get up at 4:30."

21:52.478 --> 21:55.105
And you get up at 4:30
and you make yourself breakfast.

21:55.189 --> 21:57.900
You're like, "Wow, this is good.
making breakfast. I never do that."

21:57.983 --> 21:59.151
And then you work out.

21:59.235 --> 22:00.986
You're like, "I'm working out this early.

22:01.070 --> 22:03.113
Holy shit. That's out of the way.
That's great."

22:03.197 --> 22:05.491
And then you have yourself
another breakfast.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.077
You're like,
"Okay, I'm running out of shit to do."

22:08.160 --> 22:11.580
And then you flip on the news and you go,
"There's news before the news?

22:11.664 --> 22:13.040
Who the fuck are these people?

22:13.123 --> 22:15.584
They're very good.
They should be on the real news."

22:15.668 --> 22:18.170
Then you go outside
and you see a bird eating a worm.

22:18.254 --> 22:20.014
You're like,
"Is that the fucking early bird?

22:20.047 --> 22:22.883
I've been hearing about that thing
for a long time."

22:22.967 --> 22:24.343
There he is. Holy shit."

22:24.426 --> 22:26.554
Then a bus shows up,
and your kids get on it.

22:26.637 --> 22:29.932
You're like, "That's how they fucking
get to school. Nobody fucking told me...

22:30.015 --> 22:31.934
What a day. This is interesting."

22:32.518 --> 22:36.689
And then it's around 11 o'clock
and you're in the middle of a work meeting

22:36.772 --> 22:39.817
and you're like, "How long
is this fucking day gonna go for?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.527
Let me sleep!"

22:43.529 --> 22:48.075
My wife's grandmother turned...
she turned 101 years old,

22:48.158 --> 22:50.494
which is nice, 101 years old.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.913
That's good for the family,

22:52.997 --> 22:54.874
you know, good to have that
in your genes.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.584
My daughter's got that great life.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.544
My family, we fucking die...

22:58.627 --> 23:02.548
I should be dead is all I'm saying.
It makes no sense that I'm here right now.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.258
But 101 years old...

23:04.341 --> 23:07.928
I went to her birthday,
I gave her 101 punches in the shoulder...

23:08.637 --> 23:10.639
Just, she kept going, "Ooh."

23:10.723 --> 23:14.101
And I was saying, "It's tradition.
We can't break tradition, Grandma."

23:14.184 --> 23:16.729
She was like, "I want to break tradition."

23:16.812 --> 23:20.357
I was like, "Well, you can't.
So, just fucking deal with 94 more."

23:20.441 --> 23:22.109

Are you ever wiping yourself,
uh, back there...

26:45.395 --> 26:48.148
You're wiping up pretty good,
and then you keep wiping.

26:48.232 --> 26:50.359
And then you've really...
you've got to keep wiping.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.820
And you wipe again,
and then you wipe another one.

26:52.903 --> 26:54.029
Then you go, "You know what?

26:54.113 --> 26:56.907
Just out of principal,
I'm stopping after this next one.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.367
It's fucking enough already.

26:58.450 --> 27:01.161
I don't care if I'm done or not.
This is fucking killing me.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.956
Whatever happens happens.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.291
Get me the fuck out of here.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.797
I did my first dick pic, everybody.

27:12.798 --> 27:13.799
Thank you.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.802
A dick pick is...
that's a weird thing to do.

27:16.885 --> 27:20.013
There's no reason for me to do it.
I'm fucking married.

27:20.097 --> 27:23.159
But all my friends are doing them,
so I'm like, "What the fuck, let me just...

27:23.183 --> 27:25.144
at least I can be part of the conversation

27:25.227 --> 27:26.907
when they're talking
about their dick pics.

27:26.937 --> 27:28.772
I can go, "Oh, yes, definitely."
You know?

27:30.023 --> 27:32.526
So, I do my first dick pick.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.403
I look back at it.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.697
There's a ghost in the background.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.074
So there's a ghost in the image,

27:39.158 --> 27:41.743
and I'm like,
"I live in fucking haunted house?"

27:41.827 --> 27:44.121
I had no idea. I want to show everybody...

27:44.621 --> 27:45.873
'cause...

27:45.956 --> 27:47.916
what are the chances of catching that?

27:48.667 --> 27:50.836
But my dick doesn't look...

27:51.420 --> 27:54.339
as good as I want it to look in the image.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.551
Plus, you know,
the fucking ghost was really tall,

27:57.634 --> 28:00.470
so he made my dick not look... exact.

28:00.554 --> 28:04.641
Plus the fucking ghost was holding a ruler
next to my dick.

28:04.725 --> 28:07.060
I was like, "What the fuck
is your problem?" to the ghost.

28:07.144 --> 28:08.061
He was like...

28:08.145 --> 28:10.647
The ghost was like,
"I live here too. I like to have fun."

28:11.773 --> 28:15.110

You love your kids more than anything
on the planet until like 9:30 at night.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.692
And then you're like,
"Okay... that's enough.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.904
I loved you all day long.
Just give me a little break.

29:41.405 --> 29:43.365
I answered all your crazy questions.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.575
I don't even know... I know nothing.

29:45.659 --> 29:48.620
That does not fucking help
when you have to answer your kid.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.956
I've got to make up every goddamn answer.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.416
"Are whales smart, Daddy?"

29:52.499 --> 29:55.919
"Well, you know, they're more street smart
than book smart, but..."

29:56.003 --> 29:58.797
I don't fucking know anything
about whales.

29:59.423 --> 30:02.259
My daughter plays basketball,
my nine year old.

30:02.342 --> 30:05.512
So, I go and see her play basketball,
and she's a sweetheart of a kid.

30:05.595 --> 30:08.515
And every time they put the kid
in the game, I get so excited.

30:08.598 --> 30:10.267
I take my video camera out,

30:10.350 --> 30:12.602
and I fucking video everything she does.

30:12.686 --> 30:16.023
And so, a couple Sundays ago,
I'm videoing my daughter

30:16.106 --> 30:17.274
and another dad goes,

30:17.357 --> 30:19.818
"Hey, can you email me that
when you're done?"

30:19.901 --> 30:21.528
And I go, "Yeah, absolutely, dude.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.239
And then I'm videoing my kid
and then I remembered.

30:24.323 --> 30:28.160
Actually, when I video my kid,
I say a lot of things, and...

30:28.243 --> 30:31.621
It's always not stuff
I want other people to hear.

30:31.705 --> 30:34.583
And I'm always like,
"Okay, you got it, you little cutie.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.336
You've got the ball. You're so good.
Look how good you are.

30:37.419 --> 30:40.505
You take the ball. Pass it to my kid.
Somebody pass it to my kid.

30:40.589 --> 30:43.050
I'll get a break your fucking neck,
I swear to God.

30:43.133 --> 30:46.261
Give that fucking ball to my fucking kid.
You all suck out there."

30:46.345 --> 30:50.474
And I was like, "I better not
email that to that man there.

30:50.557 --> 30:54.144
So I just emailed him
the ghost/dick pic thing.

30:54.227 --> 30:56.563
The guy was like,
"What the fuck's with the ruler?"

30:56.646 --> 31:00.275
I go, "Yeah, the ghost was an asshole.
Fuck that guy."

31:00.359 --> 31:01.359
"I'm with you."

31:01.735 --> 31:03.653
My little sweet daughter...

31:03.737 --> 31:04.821
the sixth grader,

31:04.905 --> 31:06.990
she comes back from school
and she's like,

31:07.074 --> 31:09.659
"All the boys keep saying,
'That's what she said...'

31:09.743 --> 31:11.244
and then they all laugh."

31:11.328 --> 31:13.830
- "Why Daddy?"
- And I was like, "Oh, boy."

31:13.914 --> 31:16.666
"Yeah, it seems like anything I say,

31:16.750 --> 31:18.919
they say, 'That's what she said.'

31:19.002 --> 31:22.255
They look at each other,
and they just laugh and laugh.

31:22.339 --> 31:25.175
And I'm confused. Help me Dad-da."

31:25.258 --> 31:28.428
And so, I'm like, "Okay,
how do I explain this to her?"

31:28.512 --> 31:31.681
And I'm trying to just figure out,
you know, the right way to do it,

31:31.765 --> 31:33.850
in a clean way, no cursing.

31:33.934 --> 31:36.603
And I'm just going,
"Uh... uh... uh... uh, well, it's a..."

31:36.686 --> 31:37.854
And then my kid goes,

31:37.938 --> 31:40.148
"That's okay, Daddy. You tried your best."

31:41.691 --> 31:43.985
And I was like, "That's what she said."

31:46.571 --> 31:47.697

Very nice, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you.

38:20.256 --> 38:22.717
So I'll tell you a little story
about Disney World.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.595
You want to hear
a true Adam Sandler Story?

38:25.678 --> 38:27.931
Please, I can... Okay.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.475
So you guys have been
to Disney World, right?

38:30.558 --> 38:32.644
The families have been there.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.438
Who doesn't have kids
and still goes to Disney World?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.484
You fucking stoners.

38:39.567 --> 38:41.402
I'm on to you.

38:43.446 --> 38:45.990
All right, so I go
to Disney World recently

38:46.074 --> 38:48.827
with my wife and the two kids.

38:48.910 --> 38:51.037
My kids wanted
to go on this roller coaster.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.414
They were very excited.
So, we wait on the line.

38:53.498 --> 38:55.378
We're waiting.
You know the lines are very long.

38:55.458 --> 38:57.377
So, it takes like an hour and 15 minutes.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.212
We get to the front of the line,

38:59.295 --> 39:03.967
and then the roller coaster, we find out,
only takes three people at a time.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.593
So, there's four of us.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.512
And I see my wife and the two kids

39:07.595 --> 39:09.973
just immediately start walking
to the thing.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.851
And I was like, we're not even
gonna flip a coin. Not...

39:12.934 --> 39:15.603
Not even a thought, right?
They're like, "No, no..."

39:15.687 --> 39:16.896
I was like, "Yeah. All right."

39:16.980 --> 39:19.732
And so, I'm sitting there very angry.
I'm stewing.

39:19.816 --> 39:22.277
Like, "I waited a fucking hour
and 15 minutes

39:22.360 --> 39:25.488
to go on this fucking shit with you guys,
and you fucking bail on me."

39:25.572 --> 39:29.993
Then I see it happens to some other dad
from Oklahoma, and he's muttering.

39:30.076 --> 39:33.162
He's like, "Goddamn motherfucker...
They're mean as shit.

39:33.246 --> 39:34.622
And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah."

39:34.706 --> 39:36.249
And then I say to the other dad,

39:36.332 --> 39:38.793
I go, "You want fucking me and you
to go on it together?

39:38.877 --> 39:41.421
And he's like, "What?"
I go, "Well, I'm not going alone.

39:41.504 --> 39:43.381
Let's fucking do this shit.
I'll go with you."

39:43.464 --> 39:46.175
And he's like,
"Yeah, whatever the fuck you want."

39:46.259 --> 39:47.677
And so...

39:48.219 --> 39:51.306
So I get on the roller coaster
with the guy

39:51.389 --> 39:53.029
and we're both not talking to each other.

39:53.057 --> 39:54.893
The roller coaster takes off,

39:54.976 --> 39:57.061
and you know how they take off
so fucking fast...

39:57.145 --> 40:00.231
that both our necks snap back,
and we look at each other.

40:00.315 --> 40:01.635
And he's like "Ooh, that got me."

40:01.691 --> 40:04.027
I was like, "Oh, yeah,
that was fucked up, man."

40:04.110 --> 40:05.528
We start laughing a little bit.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.739
And we're fucking
all of a sudden loosening up.

40:07.822 --> 40:11.743
And we're fucking doing all the... jetting,
banging into these fucking crazy turns.

40:11.826 --> 40:14.454
I'm fucking leaning,
100% leaning on the guy.

40:14.537 --> 40:18.249
He's looking at me like, "What the fuck?"
I was like, "Hey, here we are."

40:18.333 --> 40:20.126
And we're laughing our asses off.

40:20.209 --> 40:24.047
And I'm like, "Holy shit, I haven't been
this happy in at least 11 years.

40:24.130 --> 40:28.009
I know that, but whatever,
I'm fucking... jetting around,

40:28.092 --> 40:29.260
fucking doing loop-the-loops.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.637
He's fucking bumping my first.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.907
I'm like, "Yeah, motherfucker."
He's like, "Yeah, baby."

40:32.931 --> 40:34.474
We get to the end. The fucking...

40:34.557 --> 40:36.351
You know how the break
comes out of nowhere.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.479
It fucking screeches on,
both our fucking heads snap again.

40:39.562 --> 40:42.941
He's like, "They got us again.
I was like, "Fuck yeah, we'll never learn.

40:44.817 --> 40:49.113
So, uh, we're creeping up
to, you know, getting off the ride,

40:49.197 --> 40:50.740
how it's like a little slow at exit,

40:50.823 --> 40:52.992
and we're sitting there,
and I'm fucking...

40:53.451 --> 40:55.453
I feel this crazy pain in my heart,

40:56.245 --> 40:59.582
and I'm like, "Did I fucking fall in love
with this guy or some shit?

40:59.666 --> 41:00.792
What happened?

41:00.875 --> 41:03.503
And he's not looking at me.
I'm like this guy feels it too,

41:03.586 --> 41:05.588
'cause he's in a fucking daze.
We're both...

41:05.672 --> 41:08.675
And my kids are like,
"Come on, let's go to Peter Pan."

41:08.758 --> 41:10.426
I was like, "All right, in a minute."

41:10.510 --> 41:12.178
I'm yelling at the kids too loud.

41:12.261 --> 41:14.222
"I've got to say goodbye to the man."

41:14.305 --> 41:15.431
And, uh...

41:15.515 --> 41:17.767
I get off. I go, "Hey, nice to meet you."

41:17.850 --> 41:19.727
He's like, "Yeah, nice to meet you."

41:19.811 --> 41:21.980
He won't look at me,
and we're both all fucked up.

41:22.063 --> 41:24.524
He goes back to his family,
I go back to mine.

41:24.607 --> 41:25.817
I'm walking away.

41:25.900 --> 41:28.736
In my head, I'm like, "I'm never gonna see
that fucking guy again,

41:28.820 --> 41:30.822
and I don't feel good about that.

41:30.905 --> 41:31.905
Um...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.491
And then I...

41:33.574 --> 41:34.993
And then I go...

41:35.618 --> 41:37.495
"They take your picture though...

41:38.121 --> 41:39.247
on those rides.

41:39.789 --> 41:41.666
You know, just for memory's sake.

41:41.749 --> 41:45.169
Just, what the fuck, I'm gonna go see,
maybe they snapped us, maybe they didn't.

41:45.253 --> 41:47.839
But if they did... why not?
Fuck it, you know. Let's just see."

41:47.922 --> 41:49.340
And so, we...

41:49.424 --> 41:50.842
We go to the, uh...

41:50.925 --> 41:53.845
I go to that place
where there's the fucking monitor up.

41:53.928 --> 41:56.222
Sure enough, there's a picture
of me and the guy,

41:56.305 --> 41:59.058
upside down, in the loop-the-loop...

41:59.142 --> 42:02.687
staring so deep into each other's eyes.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.063
It was fucking bananas.

42:04.147 --> 42:07.316
I was like, "Okay, he felt it.
He definitely felt it too."

42:07.400 --> 42:12.488
So, I say to the lady behind the counter,
"Hey, how much is that?"

42:12.572 --> 42:14.699
And the lady goes, "Sixty-five dollars."

42:14.782 --> 42:16.117
I was like, "Oh. Okay."

42:16.200 --> 42:19.245
And then I take my phone out,
and I fucking snap a shot of it.

42:19.328 --> 42:22.915
And then I feel this energy behind me.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.126
I look back, and it's the guy
from Oklahoma.

42:25.209 --> 42:27.462
He's holding the picture he just bought.

42:27.545 --> 42:30.131
And he was like, "I wasn't worth it?"

42:33.676 --> 42:35.428
So, anyways...

42:35.970 --> 42:38.931
If that man is watching
my Netflix special right now,

42:39.557 --> 42:41.100
I think of you a lot, sir.

42:41.184 --> 42:42.393
I think of you a lot.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.808

48:13.891 --> 48:15.142
Really good.

48:15.226 --> 48:16.644
I liked that.

48:16.727 --> 48:19.563
Yes, those UFC guys,
they are built pretty fucking good.

48:19.647 --> 48:20.564
I can't stand...

48:20.648 --> 48:22.900
That's the only reason I don't watch.
I get so angry

48:22.983 --> 48:25.486
at how fucking chiselled
these fucking guys are.

48:25.569 --> 48:29.240
I go to the gym, of course,
but I just go to pick my wife up.

48:29.323 --> 48:31.659
I'm always like, "Hey, how was that?
How'd it go in there?"

48:31.742 --> 48:34.787
She's like, "You've got to come in."
I'm like, "Yeah, definitely."

48:35.371 --> 48:38.207
I got old enough now
that I don't take my shirt off anymore.

48:38.290 --> 48:40.709
I'm 51, 51 years old.

48:41.961 --> 48:44.296
So, I don't take my shirt off anymore

48:44.380 --> 48:47.633
when I go swimming
at, like, a hotel pool with my kids.

48:47.716 --> 48:49.260
I keep my fucking shirt on.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.223
I'm swimming,
and everyone's pointing and stuff,

48:51.303 --> 48:53.180
and like this lifeguard was yelling at me.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.349
"You can't do that."
I'm like, "What the fuck is...

48:55.433 --> 48:58.203
I'm humiliated, buddy. I just don't want
to take my fucking shirt off."

48:58.227 --> 49:00.947
He's like, "No, you've got to wear
a bathing suit, your dick is out."

49:00.980 --> 49:02.481
I'm like, "Oh, okay.

49:02.565 --> 49:05.818
Oh, this is, uh...
one of the fancy Howard Johnson's.

49:05.901 --> 49:06.944
I got you.

49:07.027 --> 49:08.737
Fuck. Sorry, man."

49:08.821 --> 49:11.323
The guys over 50 know
what I'm talking about.

49:11.407 --> 49:15.703
The testicles do get bigger and bigger
as you get older.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.622
They hang lower
and whatever the fuck happens...

49:18.706 --> 49:20.958
You know, you've seen it
at the YMCA your whole life,

49:21.041 --> 49:23.794
the older men with the giant balls,

49:23.878 --> 49:25.838
and you're always wondering

49:25.921 --> 49:28.757
why they're so free and happy, fucking...

49:28.841 --> 49:31.010
Those are like the 85-year-old guys.

49:31.093 --> 49:34.805
They don't give a fuck.
They just swing it... and whatever.

49:34.889 --> 49:36.649
They don't even think
of throwing a towel on.

49:36.682 --> 49:39.810
They're just like, "This is it.
I only got a few years left.

49:39.894 --> 49:43.063
I want... You should remember me how I am,

49:43.147 --> 49:45.024
with these giant..."

49:45.107 --> 49:46.984
My balls are not that big,

49:47.067 --> 49:50.237
but they still don't make sense
on my body.

49:50.321 --> 49:54.158
My dick literally looks
like it's sitting in a bean bag chair.

49:54.241 --> 49:57.453
Yeah, it's so comfortable.
My dick never...

49:57.536 --> 49:59.330
it never wants to leave the balls.

49:59.413 --> 50:00.789
It's always just resting.

50:00.873 --> 50:04.543
So nice, like, "I love you guys.
You're my best friends."

50:06.253 --> 50:09.131
The new giant balls get me into trouble
with my wife now,

50:09.215 --> 50:10.841
because we're both not used to them.

50:10.925 --> 50:14.512
I'm behind her doing my thing,
what you do when you're behind your wife.

50:14.595 --> 50:16.180
And I'll hear, "Hey, hey, no spanking."

50:16.263 --> 50:19.266
I'm like, "That wasn't me.
That was... That was those guys, babe."

50:19.350 --> 50:20.768
And she's like, "Oh...

50:21.352 --> 50:23.312
Oh, you got me again."

50:24.813 --> 50:27.441
Okay, this is for the people
who either live together

50:27.525 --> 50:29.109
or have been married for awhile.

50:29.193 --> 50:30.361

52:32.858 --> 52:34.777
The vagina fart

52:34.860 --> 52:37.279
has been around a long time, girls.

52:37.363 --> 52:38.572
No problem. It's fun.

52:39.156 --> 52:42.117
The vagina fart, girls, I gotta say
still gets you every time.

52:42.201 --> 52:45.412
Everybody. Every fellow here
enjoys them so much.

52:45.496 --> 52:46.955
Just keep them coming, girls.

52:47.873 --> 52:50.250
It just provides entertainment
in the bedroom.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.002
Guys do not say nothing about it.

52:52.086 --> 52:53.962
Guys will fucking ignore it every time.

52:54.046 --> 52:56.715
Just because, you know,
if you comment on it, it's fucking over.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.967
You're getting up and leaving
and that's it.

52:59.051 --> 53:02.554
So you're like, "Okay, whatever the fuck
that was, let's keep...

53:02.638 --> 53:04.056
Let's keep going forward."

53:04.139 --> 53:07.059
I have been face-to-face
with the vagina fart.

53:07.142 --> 53:10.896
I've been tagged pretty hard
by my wife right there.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.147
I don't say shit.

53:12.231 --> 53:13.857
You know, I might go like, "Uh."

53:13.941 --> 53:15.609
I might give her one of those.

53:16.193 --> 53:17.193
Hey, now.

53:17.695 --> 53:20.656
But I always get right back in there
and finish off when I started.

53:20.739 --> 53:25.077
You know, if my wife hits me
with like four or five of them in a row,

53:25.160 --> 53:28.831
I might say, "I think you've got to do
some fucking jumping jacks or some shit.

53:29.415 --> 53:31.625
You know, get a Q-Tip,

53:31.709 --> 53:33.001
fucking pop that...

53:33.085 --> 53:35.796
You got... Something's wrong.
Something's going on with you.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.549
But when you come back,
I'll fucking finish you good.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.008
I promise you.

53:40.092 --> 53:41.844
If it was reversed...

53:41.927 --> 53:44.847
let me just say...
the girls would not be as sweet to us.

53:44.930 --> 53:47.015
If there was a dick fart,
if there was such a...

53:47.099 --> 53:50.978
There's no dick fart,
but if there was a dick fart...

53:51.061 --> 53:53.731
And it would be nothing.
It's such a little hole.

53:53.814 --> 53:55.482
The sound would be nothing.

53:55.566 --> 53:57.276
Your vaginas literally are like

53:57.359 --> 54:01.155
acoustically fucking made
to blast out a boomer.

54:01.697 --> 54:05.492
And... And we're just like, "All right,
let's play it off like it didn't happen."

54:05.576 --> 54:08.370
With a dick fart, you'd be like...
At the most, it would sound like...

54:09.788 --> 54:12.332
And you'd be like,
"Whoa, what the fuck is that?"

54:16.795 --> 54:18.172
"I'm nervous. I don't know.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.382
You don't think that's cute?

54:20.883 --> 54:23.010
It sounds like a little Disney character.

54:24.511 --> 54:25.511
Cinderelly."

54:26.388 --> 54:27.306
"I'm leaving!"

54:27.389 --> 54:29.558
We'd have to play it off
like it didn't happen.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.041
Like, "No, I think the tea's ready.

54:36.607 --> 54:39.526
My wife, one time, hit me in the face
with a combo platter.

54:39.610 --> 54:42.279
She hit me with the vagina to the mouth...

54:42.362 --> 54:43.363
Up high.

54:43.947 --> 54:47.284
At the very same time,
hit me in the neck with the other...

54:47.367 --> 54:48.452
the, uh...

54:48.535 --> 54:51.497
She came up high and down low
at the very same time.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.999
I fucking don't know what happened.
One time in 20 years.

54:54.082 --> 54:56.585
Just fucking bam, in the face,
one in the neck.

54:56.668 --> 54:59.421
Fucking hit me hard,
it was like the perfect storm.

54:59.505 --> 55:01.632
We don't know
what she was eating that day,

55:01.715 --> 55:03.175
but whatever the fuck it was,

55:03.258 --> 55:04.551
she got me good.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.637
I've got to say, it literally felt like

55:06.720 --> 55:09.139
somebody opened the door
on a fucking airplane.

55:09.223 --> 55:10.641
It was like, "Whoa!"

55:12.184 --> 55:14.812
There was debris in the air and fucking...

55:15.312 --> 55:18.148
Other passengers were floating
through my fucking room.

55:20.400 --> 55:22.903
Oxygen masks dropped down.
You know, I was...

55:22.986 --> 55:24.321
But I fucking took it like...

55:24.404 --> 55:27.115
I did wish someone else saw it.
That was fucking incredible.

55:27.199 --> 55:30.953
And then I hear the ghost go,
"I saw that shit. Oh, my God.

55:31.036 --> 55:33.622
It fucking blew the ruler out of my hand."

55:35.958 --> 55:39.461
So I tell my wife recently
I would love to try anal.

55:39.545 --> 55:42.631
And I say to my wife,
"Hey, I would love to try anal."

55:42.714 --> 55:44.466
And she goes, "Oh, I wouldn't."

55:44.550 --> 55:45.801
And then I say, "Oh."

55:46.802 --> 55:48.011
I said, "But I would."

55:48.095 --> 55:50.138
And she goes, "Yeah, I know. I heard."

55:51.181 --> 55:53.225
And then I said, "Okay, so let's..."

55:53.308 --> 55:54.601
I really think we should.

55:54.685 --> 55:56.353
She goes, "I'm just not into that."

55:56.436 --> 55:58.230
And then I said, "You know, what?

55:59.398 --> 56:00.399
I love you.

56:00.482 --> 56:02.568
I'm gonna be with you
for the rest of my life.

56:02.651 --> 56:04.152
I've been with you 20 years.

56:04.236 --> 56:06.864
I've never cheated on you.
I never will cheat on you.

56:06.947 --> 56:09.491
It's you and me against the world, baby.

56:09.575 --> 56:13.036
And, uh... I really...
I got nowhere else to get this anal.

56:13.120 --> 56:14.705
So...

56:14.788 --> 56:16.628
I was like, "You've got
to fucking help me out.

56:16.665 --> 56:18.292
It's a fantasy. Please?"

56:18.375 --> 56:19.251
And, uh...

56:19.334 --> 56:21.962
And she was nice. She said okay.

56:22.045 --> 56:24.590
And so, on my birthday, she gave it up.

56:24.673 --> 56:27.384
She gave it to me,
and she said she liked it.

56:27.467 --> 56:29.177
She said it was fun

56:29.261 --> 56:32.097
and she couldn't believe
she fit her whole fist inside me...

56:32.180 --> 56:34.224
And so... I don't know.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.894
I said, "You see? New experiences."

56:38.478 --> 56:40.188
She's a good girl. That's my baby.

56:40.689 --> 56:42.107
That's my baby.

56:42.190 --> 56:44.109
