00:04.885 --> 00:07.649
( clock ticking )

00:10.000 --> 00:20.000
STONE (2010)

00:28.442 --> 00:31.138
Male TV announcer:
lt was a very short putt.

00:31.178 --> 00:34.636
lt would seem routine had he not
just come off a bogey the hole before.

00:34.681 --> 00:38.082
Mm-hmm, obviously
smarting from that.

00:38.118 --> 00:41.212
- But let's see what he does here.
- ( ball rattles into hole )

00:41.254 --> 00:44.280
Oh perfect.
Textbook, textbook.

00:44.324 --> 00:47.487
We move ahead now to Lee Trevino
on the fairway at the seventh.

00:47.527 --> 00:51.054
His lie looks as though
he may be in a little divot.

00:51.098 --> 00:54.693
Absolutely. Tournament officials
have been cracking down

00:54.735 --> 00:56.703
on caddies filling in the divots.

00:56.737 --> 00:59.900
At this level of the game, some of us
gotta watch the etiquette of golf.

00:59.940 --> 01:03.000

01:14.888 --> 01:17.152
Just go to sleep.

01:23.697 --> 01:26.461
( insect buzzing )

01:42.849 --> 01:45.079
TV announcer:
A lovely approach.

01:45.118 --> 01:48.383
He's considering it now.
l presume that a player like...

01:48.422 --> 01:50.549
( buzzing continues )

01:55.929 --> 01:58.864
( buzz echoing )

02:13.079 --> 02:16.674
TV announcer: Sand wedge
or intermediate pitching wedge.

02:16.716 --> 02:19.276
Oh, very exciting.
He's lining up the shot.

02:24.624 --> 02:26.455
Look at me.

02:27.861 --> 02:29.726
Hmm?

02:29.763 --> 02:33.426
l'm not standing for this.

02:33.467 --> 02:35.435
Sorry?

02:36.937 --> 02:39.565
You keep my soul in a dungeon.

02:42.042 --> 02:44.033
l'm leaving.

02:56.723 --> 02:58.190
Jack?

03:03.630 --> 03:06.622
- Jack.
- lf you leave me, l'll throw her.

03:06.666 --> 03:08.759
( bee buzzing )

03:08.802 --> 03:11.134
You think that l won't, hmm?

03:12.272 --> 03:14.502
- Please.
- Do you think l won't?!

03:16.510 --> 03:19.968
l won't leave.
l won't leave you.

03:30.257 --> 03:32.725
( buzzing stops )

03:34.194 --> 03:37.095
l'm sorry.
Don't ever do that again.

03:37.130 --> 03:39.724
Don't ever leave me.
Don't ever do that again.

03:54.514 --> 03:58.314
¶ All things bright and beautiful ¶

03:58.351 --> 04:02.685
¶ All creatures great and small ¶

04:02.722 --> 04:06.715
¶ All things wise and wonderful ¶

04:06.760 --> 04:11.663
¶ The Lord God made them all. ¶

04:11.698 --> 04:13.723
l invite you to be seated at this time.

04:18.103 --> 04:21.164
( applause on TV )

04:21.207 --> 04:23.505
TV announcer #1 :
Oh, that's a very nice touch.

04:23.543 --> 04:25.977
So maybe he can make a par.
And at worse from there

04:26.012 --> 04:27.775
you'd think he could stay
his point total.

04:27.814 --> 04:30.544
Now here we find him
with a 7-iron at this par-3 hole.

04:35.155 --> 04:37.453
Announcer #2:
l don't know if there was a problem

04:37.490 --> 04:40.550
with him slippin' with his right foot
there, but definitely a pull.

04:40.594 --> 04:42.425
Announcer #1 :
He obviously had the thought in his head

04:42.462 --> 04:44.293
that he needed
to give it a little bit extra,

04:44.331 --> 04:46.731
and he's found himself
in a difficult spot.

04:46.766 --> 04:49.997
Announcer #2: All the expectations
he had coming into this...

04:50.036 --> 04:52.129
( ringing )

04:56.376 --> 04:59.106
- Hello?
- Woman: Jack.

05:00.847 --> 05:03.111
Betsy.

05:03.149 --> 05:04.912
Your brother slipped away.

05:04.951 --> 05:08.011
Oh oh,

05:08.054 --> 05:09.646
finally out of his misery.

05:09.689 --> 05:12.021
- Betsy: Yes, he is.
- Oh, l know, l know.

05:12.058 --> 05:15.323
And how many times did l hear, ''Why
can't you be like your brother Bobby''?

05:15.362 --> 05:18.729
lf l had a nickel for every time
that was said to me...

05:20.166 --> 05:22.930
l'd be a rich man today.

05:22.969 --> 05:26.461
That scar on his forehead that he had,

05:26.506 --> 05:29.532
he always had a story for it,

05:29.576 --> 05:33.012
but it was me. l threw a hammer
at Mr. Perfect when l was eight.

05:33.046 --> 05:34.946
( crowd murmuring )

05:34.981 --> 05:37.381
He never told though.
He covered for the people he loved.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.853
That's how he was
and l loved him for that.

05:40.887 --> 05:43.447
And l wanted to be like him.

05:43.490 --> 05:45.253
Everything--

05:56.403 --> 05:58.564
l just want to say that...

06:02.108 --> 06:05.339
if it wasn't for Bobby, l'd...

06:07.147 --> 06:10.310
l-l don't know...

06:10.350 --> 06:12.682
where l would've wound up.

06:13.820 --> 06:17.381
He taught me how to live,
what was right.

06:19.859 --> 06:22.487
l'm gonna miss him.

06:22.529 --> 06:25.930
He lived right. He lived right.
He was...

06:25.965 --> 06:30.732
what more could you s--
want people to say about you?

06:32.872 --> 06:34.567
( bird squawking )

06:34.607 --> 06:37.974
Woman on radio: All throughout Scripture
it talks about God being a just God.

06:38.011 --> 06:41.970
l mean, l just read the parable
about the unjust judge,

06:42.015 --> 06:46.042
where the woman kept coming
and coming and saying...

06:46.086 --> 06:48.418
Man #1 on radio:
Caring, loving, forgiving...

06:48.455 --> 06:51.219
Man #2: l'm wondering if you concur
with what you've heard so far?

06:51.257 --> 06:54.283
Man #3: l think that the choices,
the idea of free will,

06:54.327 --> 06:56.352
and the fact that
we have freedom of choice...

06:56.396 --> 06:58.762
( overlapping dialogue on radio )

07:07.640 --> 07:10.438
Male radio host #1 :
The reality of the times we live in,

07:10.477 --> 07:16.040
this notion that-- this angst that a lot
of people are feeling in this country,

07:16.082 --> 07:19.483
that we've gone through some sort
of fundamental transformation...

07:19.519 --> 07:22.113
Male radio host #2:
...Barack Obama earlier today, crediting

07:22.155 --> 07:26.922
his so-called stimulus package
that he signed four or five months ago,

07:26.960 --> 07:30.123
as ''putting cash
into the pockets of taxpayers.''

07:30.163 --> 07:33.291
lf you're a taxpayer
in the Detroit area

07:33.333 --> 07:35.858
who got cash in your pocket
from the stimulus plan,

07:35.902 --> 07:38.268
l'd love to hear from ya, and you
can also check in via the internet,

07:38.304 --> 07:40.295
but we would love
to hear from you personally.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.900
Kevin in Warren. We go to Kevin.
Kevin thanks so much for calling.

07:42.942 --> 07:44.239
Welcome.

07:52.085 --> 07:54.246
Hi, Paul.

08:06.733 --> 08:08.223
Thanks.

08:17.577 --> 08:19.568
( people chattering )

08:34.494 --> 08:36.462
No, it's true.

08:36.496 --> 08:39.397
With God is my witness, l've changed.

08:39.432 --> 08:41.662
With Jesus and my family...
( voice echoing )

08:45.338 --> 08:48.307
( voices overlapping, echoing )

09:04.624 --> 09:07.149
Oh my God,
l'm sorry for what l've done.

09:07.193 --> 09:10.219
l mean, l robbed a goddamn
liquor store with a toy gun.

09:10.263 --> 09:13.391
What kinda--
what kinda idiot does that?

09:13.433 --> 09:15.560
( voices echoing )

09:36.789 --> 09:39.058
Warden wants to see you.

09:44.063 --> 09:45.724
Hi, Allie.

09:46.966 --> 09:50.163
- Hi, Mitch. Janice.
- Jack.

09:50.203 --> 09:52.467
- What's up?
- Shut the door, Jack.

10:01.381 --> 10:04.407
This Deshawn Mackey guy.

10:06.352 --> 10:09.446
- This is yours? Your report, right?
- Yeah. Yeah. Why?

10:09.489 --> 10:12.151
lt's an incompetent mess, Jack.

10:12.191 --> 10:15.092
l mean, look, l know your head's
already out on the golf course,

10:15.128 --> 10:18.359
but this is a travesty
of proper casework here.

10:22.902 --> 10:26.895
( snickers )

10:26.940 --> 10:29.568
- l got ya.
- You got me.

10:29.609 --> 10:33.636
Here. Learn from the master
of understatement.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.240
- Absolutely.
- Keep 'em brief.

10:36.282 --> 10:40.150
Now l need to get Janice up to speed
before you're out the back door,

10:40.186 --> 10:43.678
so let's pass all your
indeterminates eligible off to her.

10:43.723 --> 10:47.056
Yeah yeah, of course,
but l'd like to stay on my currents,

10:47.093 --> 10:50.187
if l can see them through
to review-- is that okay?

10:51.597 --> 10:54.065
Yeah, if you're willing.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.692
- l would like to. Thank you.
- Yeah.

10:55.735 --> 10:58.135
- We're good.
- Janice: Okay.

10:59.372 --> 11:01.533
Oh, hey, l'm sorry.

11:01.574 --> 11:03.269
Excuse me?

11:03.309 --> 11:05.709
Your brother--
l just recently heard, l'm sorry.

11:05.745 --> 11:07.474
Thank you.

11:13.186 --> 11:15.450
- Okay.
- Yeah.

11:15.488 --> 11:17.649
( blower whirring )

11:24.664 --> 11:27.656
( phone ringing )

11:44.417 --> 11:47.386
S-- Stone.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.445
Hmm?

11:49.489 --> 11:51.389
No, l-l'm Stone.

11:51.424 --> 11:54.552
l mean, l know it say
''Gerald'' in the file,

11:54.594 --> 11:58.621
but l'm just saying l prefer Stone.

11:58.664 --> 12:01.690
Gerald Creeson.
So what's Stone, like a nickname?

12:01.734 --> 12:03.565
That's something from here?

12:03.603 --> 12:05.434
No. Oh no, man.
Fuck all these assholes.

12:05.471 --> 12:08.770
Yo, that's what my people call me.
You know, people who know me.

12:12.178 --> 12:15.409
Look, are we just gonna, like-- are you
just gonna tick the boxes and shit?

12:15.448 --> 12:17.973
l mean, can we-- can we talk straight?

12:18.017 --> 12:21.248
l mean, you gonna help me out or what?
'Cause l, you know, l don't think

12:21.287 --> 12:23.585
- l deserve to be up in here no more.
- Let's just slow down. Slow slow down.

12:23.623 --> 12:26.023
l've done a long bid, man.
Three more years ain't gonna--

12:26.059 --> 12:29.085
Slow down. Let's-let's talk
about what got you here.

12:29.128 --> 12:31.062
- You want to tell me about that?
- lt's right there in front of you.

12:31.097 --> 12:33.657
- Why you want to talk about that again?
- 'Cause now you're mine.

12:33.699 --> 12:35.599
You moved up.

12:35.635 --> 12:37.762
And just 'cause l like to chat.

12:37.804 --> 12:40.830
All these scrubs in here, you know,
these short-timers and meatballs,

12:40.873 --> 12:43.205
they're like,
they're all innocent, right?

12:43.242 --> 12:46.006
Yeah. But at least l admit it.

12:46.045 --> 12:48.013
You know, l copped
to what l did right away,

12:48.047 --> 12:50.481
and-and now
l'm lookin' forward, man.

12:50.516 --> 12:52.609
l got a job lined up
and l'm sayin',

12:52.652 --> 12:55.849
why l got to talk about that shit
every fuckin' time?

12:55.888 --> 12:57.753
'Cause l want to hear
your side of it, that's why.

12:57.790 --> 12:59.781
You know what? Just fuck this shit.
Fuck you too.

12:59.826 --> 13:02.192
- l ain't got time for this bullshit.
- Hey, son--

13:02.228 --> 13:04.719
No, you're just settin' them up
so they can flop me, man.

13:04.764 --> 13:06.994
So you write what you're gonna write
and let's just get on with it, man.

13:07.033 --> 13:09.058
- 'Cause l'll take the flop.
- Hey, son. Stone.

13:09.102 --> 13:10.592
- Go ahead, max me, max me.
- Son, calm down.

13:10.636 --> 13:12.695
You don't think l'll do it,
l'll see that max standing

13:12.738 --> 13:14.000
- on my fucking head, man.
- Stone!

13:14.040 --> 13:15.769
l'll see you outside
before you see me, bitch.

13:15.808 --> 13:18.402
Stone! ln about
two fucking seconds you're gonna

13:18.444 --> 13:21.880
go in the hole, and your file is
gonna go to the bottom of my pile.

13:21.914 --> 13:24.815
You understand?
You see that door in front of you?

13:24.851 --> 13:27.251
You know where it goes-- back.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.345
You want to go back?
Be my guest.

13:29.388 --> 13:31.982
You want to go forward,
you want to walk out of here,

13:32.024 --> 13:34.515
you want to find that door?
Me, l'm that door.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.654
And you will go through me. lf l ask
you a question about the weather,

13:37.697 --> 13:40.757
you better fucking answer it or go back
and l'll see you in three years.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.324
- You got it?
- Yeah.

13:42.368 --> 13:44.928
- Then sit the fuck down.
- All right.

13:50.276 --> 13:52.608
Well, we just shootin' the shit.

13:52.645 --> 13:54.374
( Stone chuckles )

13:54.413 --> 13:57.678
l like her, man. She's hard.

14:02.722 --> 14:05.623
Okay. All right, look,

14:05.658 --> 14:08.024
look, this is a process.

14:08.060 --> 14:10.187
We talk.

14:10.229 --> 14:12.891
We're not friends,
but just pretend we're friends, okay?

14:12.932 --> 14:15.162
Relax, just-just talk, that's all,

14:15.201 --> 14:17.863
and then maybe we both get
what we want, okay?

14:17.904 --> 14:21.340
- Okay, let's pretend.
- Okay.

14:21.374 --> 14:23.171
You're married.

14:23.209 --> 14:25.370
Yeah.

14:25.411 --> 14:27.140
Okay, that's good.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.704
How long are you married?

14:28.748 --> 14:31.911
Nine years, man--
eight of it up in this shit.

14:31.951 --> 14:34.681
lt's right in the file, man.
l don't want--

14:37.089 --> 14:38.647
Let's talk about your wife.

14:38.691 --> 14:41.091
- Lucetta?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

14:41.127 --> 14:43.118
- Has she come up here? You seen her?
- No.

14:43.162 --> 14:45.960
- She's a dime, dawg.
- What's a dime?

14:45.998 --> 14:48.125
Perfect 10, man. She's fine.

14:48.167 --> 14:51.694
l'll tell you, between you and me,

14:51.737 --> 14:53.705
she's-she's a alien.

14:53.739 --> 14:55.570
Alien? What do you mean,
like an illegal?

14:55.608 --> 14:58.406
No, she ain't illegal, man.
She's whiter than you.

14:58.444 --> 15:00.639
No, she's like-- she's like a--

15:00.680 --> 15:03.080
she's an alien
from another world, man.

15:06.719 --> 15:10.177
She visit you much?
Picnics most Saturdays?

15:10.223 --> 15:13.454
l don't want no picnic, man.
l miss my dick in her fuckin' ass.

15:13.492 --> 15:15.892
You know, l miss her suckin' me
till l can't take no more.

15:15.928 --> 15:18.829
l mean, she's crazy.
She'll do anything.

15:18.864 --> 15:22.061
Fuck her tits, come in her face, she'll
just blink and keep on laughing, man.

15:22.101 --> 15:23.659
lt's-- she--

15:23.703 --> 15:26.069
look, if we gonna talk about Lucetta,
you better watch out,

15:26.105 --> 15:27.936
'cause l'm gonna give you
some pictures in your head

15:27.974 --> 15:29.908
gonna keep you up nights, man.

15:33.412 --> 15:35.471
Oh man.

15:35.514 --> 15:39.746
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.
l-l got a mouth, l know.

15:39.785 --> 15:42.913
l apologize, man.
You're givin' me that look,

15:42.955 --> 15:46.823
and l feel like you go down here
and that's the end of this shit.

15:46.859 --> 15:48.918
Look, l don't want no beef with you.

15:48.961 --> 15:50.986
l just want to be vegetarian.

15:51.030 --> 15:53.123
( chair creaks )

15:57.737 --> 15:59.637
ls that your wife?
You're married?

16:00.773 --> 16:02.673
Yeah.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.676
- A long time?
- 43 years.

16:04.710 --> 16:07.008
Get the fuck out.

16:07.046 --> 16:09.640
Man, that's true love, huh?

16:09.682 --> 16:12.617
That's great, and after 43 years
and you still get it on and everything?

16:12.652 --> 16:16.144
- Excuse me?
- No, l'm really curious about this.

16:16.188 --> 16:18.156
lt's like, say, l love my lady, right,

16:18.190 --> 16:20.715
but, you know, l wonder sometimes,

16:20.760 --> 16:24.389
like how you gonna do
when the skin starts to go to the crepe,

16:24.430 --> 16:27.922
you know what l'm sayin'? l mean,
what do-- how does that work for you?

16:27.967 --> 16:31.733
Like you get hip to Viagra,
so you can like hammer nails with it?

16:31.771 --> 16:36.003
Listen listen, look, l don't talk
with anybody about my wife like that.

16:36.042 --> 16:39.011
l ain't talkin' about your wife.
l'm sayin', for me,

16:39.045 --> 16:40.979
you know,
l've been locked up a long time.

16:41.013 --> 16:43.880
You don't need much more than two
pumps and a swirl to get it done.

16:43.916 --> 16:45.440
l don't consider this polite conversation.

16:45.484 --> 16:49.420
l ain't tryin' to be rude, okay?
l really want to know

16:49.455 --> 16:51.582
where does that go?

16:51.624 --> 16:54.218
Or where do you put it, if you--

16:54.260 --> 16:56.057
you get what l'm sayin'?

16:56.095 --> 16:58.620
l want to know
how it works for you,

16:58.664 --> 17:00.393
how you keep a lid on that.

17:00.433 --> 17:03.732
We're not--
we're not talking about me.

17:03.769 --> 17:06.567
We're not talking about me, okay?

17:07.973 --> 17:08.007
Radio host:
Man looks on the outward appearance.

17:08.007 --> 17:09.634
Radio host:
Man looks on the outward appearance.

17:09.675 --> 17:12.075
God looks on the heart.

17:12.111 --> 17:14.579
And certainly the heart
of a man does matter,

17:14.613 --> 17:17.047
because out of the abundance
of the heart the mouth speaks...

17:17.083 --> 17:19.483
( speaking Spanish )

17:36.602 --> 17:40.003
Male radio caller: Only in the choices
that God decides to present to us.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.529
Host:
Well, no, l'm not saying that.

17:41.574 --> 17:45.908
l'm saying that l just believe
that we're automatons...

18:15.074 --> 18:16.837
Radio:
...and here's the deal:

18:16.876 --> 18:19.674
- l did not choose to be born...
- Madylyn: This is very very serious.

18:19.712 --> 18:23.011
...and l cannot choose to be born again.

18:23.048 --> 18:25.448
She's four-- can you believe it?

18:25.484 --> 18:28.146
Radio: l had no choice
in that matter whatsoever, and yet

18:28.187 --> 18:30.587
- there are so many people that...
- Where have you gone?

18:30.623 --> 18:32.614
...think they have a choice
in the matter

18:32.658 --> 18:36.253
of their spiritual rebirth
and their spiritual formation.

18:36.295 --> 18:40.698
The fact of the matter is, a seed
is planted and conception takes place,

18:40.733 --> 18:43.065
- which you had nothing to do with.
- Male caller: Amen.

18:43.102 --> 18:45.434
All Voices Under God, WDDL,

18:45.471 --> 18:49.032
will continue here right after
these very important messages.

18:50.876 --> 18:53.970
Stone: Look, we was high as shit
and we were lookin' for money.

18:54.013 --> 18:56.004
You know?
My poppy hears us.

18:56.048 --> 18:57.606
Him and Teach have words.

18:57.650 --> 18:59.311
Poppy goes and gets his gun.

18:59.351 --> 19:01.512
And l was like, ''Fuck this.
l don't want no part of this,''

19:01.554 --> 19:03.317
and l went outside.

19:03.355 --> 19:07.223
So then, Teach done what he done
and then the house got burnt.

19:09.094 --> 19:11.187
lt was--
you know, it was terrible.

19:11.230 --> 19:13.198
l was like a terrible mistake
that l made.

19:13.232 --> 19:15.792
l was tragic and it was
a long time ago

19:15.835 --> 19:18.429
and l've paid-- l've paid...

19:18.471 --> 19:20.939
with a lot of hard time.

19:20.973 --> 19:24.101
And l just think, you know,
l'm so ready to be out

19:24.143 --> 19:26.338
and start my life again,

19:26.378 --> 19:28.744
and well, so what--

19:28.781 --> 19:31.215
you know, what-what-what
can we do to make that happen?

19:31.250 --> 19:32.774
How can you help me
make that happen?

19:32.818 --> 19:35.286
Well, we'll see.

19:35.321 --> 19:37.789
We were just getting started, so--

19:37.823 --> 19:41.122
A lot of good things have
happened for me in here, you know.

19:41.160 --> 19:43.025
l did my GED like that, man.

19:43.062 --> 19:45.223
l held down this job--
Textiles Unit,

19:45.264 --> 19:47.129
number one position
the last two years.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.896
l'm goin' home to my wife.
She's got a spot for me, you know,

19:49.935 --> 19:52.233
Mount Elliot Chrysler,
job lined up.

19:52.271 --> 19:55.138
- l'm-l'm going, you know.
- Yeah, whose idea was it?

19:55.174 --> 19:57.438
Lucetta-- she knows
the branch manager at Mount Elliot.

19:57.476 --> 19:58.966
No no, not your job.

19:59.011 --> 20:01.502
Whose idea was it
to go to your grandparent's?

20:01.547 --> 20:03.105
- What?
- Whose idea was it?

20:07.686 --> 20:10.382
l told you--
l told you it was Teach.

20:10.422 --> 20:12.083
Teach, you know.

20:12.124 --> 20:14.684
Like l said, l wasn't even--

20:14.727 --> 20:17.093
l was-- l went outside the house.

20:17.129 --> 20:19.359
Yeah, but you
didn't stop them, did you?

20:19.398 --> 20:21.992
- Stop 'em what?
- From killing your grandparents.

20:25.371 --> 20:28.169
You-you-you ain't gonna do it, man.

20:29.575 --> 20:31.702
You're not gonna--

20:32.978 --> 20:36.607
You don't give a fuck, man. Shit.

20:38.417 --> 20:41.443
l was outside,

20:41.487 --> 20:44.786
Teach-- Teach come out,

20:44.823 --> 20:48.315
and l didn't even know
what he'd done until he told me.

20:48.360 --> 20:50.885
Teach testified to that, man.

20:50.930 --> 20:53.831
He-- that's why l didn't even
catch the rap

20:53.866 --> 20:55.527
for-- for manslaughter.

20:55.568 --> 20:57.968
l got accessory and arson.

20:58.003 --> 21:00.631
l've done eight out of 10-15.

21:00.673 --> 21:04.769
l mean, what-- what more
do you want from me?

21:06.745 --> 21:09.839
Okay, so,

21:09.882 --> 21:11.975
let's make today

21:12.017 --> 21:14.577
an extra special day.

21:14.620 --> 21:18.112
Let's do one nice thing
for someone else,

21:18.157 --> 21:22.355
but not tell
anyone else that we did it, okay?

21:22.394 --> 21:24.123
( all agree )

21:24.163 --> 21:27.326
Madylyn: Win with the seventh deuce,
it's 10 bucks for everybody.

21:27.366 --> 21:29.197
- ( phone ringing )
- Win both ways with the seven deuce,

21:29.234 --> 21:31.202
- 20 bucks a head.
- Jacks wild?

21:31.236 --> 21:32.794
Jacks definitely not wild.

21:32.838 --> 21:35.830
- Woman: Marsha, stay in?
- ( rings )

21:35.874 --> 21:37.364
Hello?

21:37.409 --> 21:40.742
- Woman: Hi, is this Jack Mabry's place?
- Excuse me?

21:40.779 --> 21:43.145
Oh, my name is Lucetta Creeson.
My husband's...

21:43.182 --> 21:45.116
Excuse me,
l couldn't understand what--

21:45.150 --> 21:48.881
- Can l speak to Jack Mabry?
- Well, this is Mrs. Mabry.

21:48.921 --> 21:51.617
Okay, can l speak to Jack?

21:51.657 --> 21:54.125
You need my husband.
l can give him a mess--

21:54.159 --> 21:56.150
( dial tone )

21:59.531 --> 22:01.761
( people chattering )

22:11.910 --> 22:14.538
- Stone: Hey, you get ahold of him?
- Lucetta: She was a little short.

22:14.580 --> 22:18.277
You know? Like, l don't know. Like she
didn't want to talk or something.

22:18.317 --> 22:19.682
Why-why-why you talkin' to her?

22:19.718 --> 22:21.709
Hey, Tommy, Tommy, we don't bite.

22:21.754 --> 22:24.621
Huh-uh, no biting, okay?

22:24.657 --> 22:28.320
Do you understand what l'm sayin'?
l need you to do this for me right now.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.487
Right now. Don't let it slide.

22:30.529 --> 22:32.793
Lucetta:
Okay, l will.

22:32.831 --> 22:35.800
Stone:
Okay? Call him tonight.

22:35.834 --> 22:38.359
Call him tomorrow.
Call him tomorrow night.

22:38.404 --> 22:41.032
Call him the day after.
Call him the day after tomorrow night.

22:41.073 --> 22:44.236
That's what l'm getting at is do you
believe what you did was wrong?

22:44.276 --> 22:46.972
What-what d'you think,
because l grew up westside

22:47.012 --> 22:50.106
that like l'm one of
these socio-delinquent types,

22:50.149 --> 22:53.118
don't know the difference
between right and wrong?

22:53.152 --> 22:55.746
You want me to tell you
about my bad childhood and shit?

22:55.788 --> 22:57.255
l don't know. Did you have one?

22:57.289 --> 23:00.224
Well, you know, at the time,
l thought a lot of shit was normal.

23:00.259 --> 23:03.387
lt was definitely unhealthy,

23:03.429 --> 23:05.897
but on the same token,
you know, l didn't think

23:05.931 --> 23:08.297
l was a bad person to begin with.

23:08.333 --> 23:11.496
So, you know, l mean,
what, you want to know

23:11.537 --> 23:13.835
if l'm gonna light
any more grandparents on fire?

23:13.872 --> 23:15.669
- Are you?
- No.

23:15.708 --> 23:18.836
- You got any more?
- Yeah, l got one.

23:18.877 --> 23:22.472
Yeah well, try to make
a better effort with that one.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.985
l'm not trying to be flip.

23:32.224 --> 23:35.057
l think l deserve to be free, l do.

23:35.094 --> 23:37.119
Why, because you did the time?

23:37.162 --> 23:40.063
That's it, you're ready?
Now you're a clean slate?

23:40.099 --> 23:43.432
l'm clean as anybody, man.
l'm clean as you.

23:43.469 --> 23:46.199
( chuckles )
Well, maybe, maybe not.

23:46.238 --> 23:49.105
Seriously, let me
ask you something, you know.

23:49.141 --> 23:51.632
Why are you-- why are you--
why are you gonna sit there,

23:51.677 --> 23:54.077
like, asking me these questions
like you never done nothin'?

23:54.113 --> 23:58.345
l mean, you know, why do you
get to walk around free and l don't?

23:58.383 --> 24:00.283
l wasn't convicted of a crime.

24:00.319 --> 24:02.310
Oh, come--
you never did anything bad?

24:02.354 --> 24:05.448
Never did anybody no wrong,
had to be forgiven for nothin'?

24:05.491 --> 24:06.981
No, never broke the law.

24:07.025 --> 24:09.084
What, you never got
a speeding ticket?

24:09.128 --> 24:11.926
You never backed somebody up
in a bar fight or something?

24:11.964 --> 24:15.229
Shit, Vietnam-- you never killed
some kid-- you carry that with you?

24:15.267 --> 24:16.791
You step out on your wife,

24:16.835 --> 24:18.962
you fuck that little 15-year-old
who looked at you sideways?

24:19.004 --> 24:21.029
- Okay okay.
- No, come on, man! Come on!

24:21.073 --> 24:25.635
How long you get to keep judgin'
a person for one bad thing they done?

24:25.677 --> 24:28.407
No matter how much l paid,
l gotta keep eatin' shit with you?

24:28.447 --> 24:30.074
For how long?

24:31.517 --> 24:34.884
That ain't right. lt ain't.

24:34.920 --> 24:37.252
l mean, l'm beggin' you, man.
l'm beggin' you.

24:37.289 --> 24:41.123
l'm a person. l'm a person.
Look at my record, you know.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.151
Look at-- look at
what l've done in here.

24:43.195 --> 24:46.028
l mean, l'm different
than when l come in here, man.

24:46.064 --> 24:50.933
l've grown a lot.
l'm like fuckin' reborn, man.

24:50.969 --> 24:53.767
What does that mean to you,
being reborn?

24:56.942 --> 24:58.432
What?

25:00.379 --> 25:02.472
What does that mean to you?

25:06.251 --> 25:08.219
( car horn honks )

25:10.756 --> 25:14.317
- ( car horn honks )
- ( passing car horn blares )

25:22.835 --> 25:25.736
Hi. Yeah, l'm back.

25:27.573 --> 25:30.098
- Hey, Mrs. Creeson.
- Hey, Jake.

25:31.877 --> 25:34.141
( metallic jingling )

25:43.322 --> 25:45.222
Thanks. Bye, guys.

25:45.257 --> 25:46.781
( door buzzes )

25:59.671 --> 26:01.229
Guard: Creeson!

26:04.042 --> 26:06.875
Oh, the rows look so nice.
l like 'em thick, baby.

26:06.912 --> 26:08.311

- lt looks really good.

26:08.347 --> 26:10.076
- l've been using that mousse you sent.
- Yeah?

26:10.115 --> 26:12.413
'Cause Crystal said you put the rag on
before you go to sleep,

26:12.451 --> 26:16.114
and when you wake up they're still all
clean and nice-- they look really good.

26:16.154 --> 26:19.385
They look tight.
You look so fucking good.

26:19.424 --> 26:21.392
l miss you so much.

26:25.030 --> 26:27.021
( boots squeaking )

26:30.869 --> 26:34.168
What have you got to tell me?
l mean...

26:36.108 --> 26:37.871
Well, l called him

26:37.910 --> 26:41.141
and he didn't call me back,
so l left another message.

26:41.179 --> 26:45.172
Okay, that's good, but you know you
got to get with him person to person.

26:45.217 --> 26:47.879
- l'm on it. Baby, l'm on it.
- One on one, you know what l'm saying?

26:47.920 --> 26:51.253
l gotta have you with me on it.
l can't do this by myself.

26:51.290 --> 26:53.383
Anything.

26:53.425 --> 26:56.792
l would do anything for you,
you know that, right?

26:56.828 --> 26:58.193
Yeah.

26:59.231 --> 27:00.562
Okay okay.

27:00.599 --> 27:03.830
Baby, l wore
something special for you.

27:03.869 --> 27:05.564
Did you? What did you wear?

27:05.604 --> 27:08.129
- Nothing.
- Oh God.

27:10.208 --> 27:11.698
You're killin' me.

27:14.913 --> 27:16.676
( moans )

27:18.383 --> 27:20.442
Oh no.
Okay okay okay.

27:20.485 --> 27:22.112
- What?
- This is too much. No no.

27:22.154 --> 27:25.487
Come on. No no, l'm sorry. Just come on.
Come here, come here.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.592
Honey?

27:28.627 --> 27:30.254
l can't get no ticket.

27:30.295 --> 27:32.422
l can't get a ticket,
you understand, right?

27:32.464 --> 27:34.091
l'm too close.

27:34.132 --> 27:37.158
- Baby. Baby.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:37.202 --> 27:40.228
Okay, l'm so close.

27:40.272 --> 27:43.241
- What am l gonna do?
- lt's gonna happen.

27:43.275 --> 27:45.470
- l can't do much more of this.
- Don't worry.

27:45.510 --> 27:47.375
l can't.
l ain't gonna make it.

27:47.412 --> 27:49.539
l'm serious, Lucetta.

27:49.581 --> 27:53.210
l just think l want--
like l want to kill myself.

27:53.251 --> 27:56.482
You don't even joke like that, okay?

27:56.521 --> 27:58.079
Don't joke.

27:58.123 --> 28:00.421
l love you.

28:03.929 --> 28:06.295
You want something to eat?
l got some cream puffs

28:06.331 --> 28:09.562
and some animal crackers
and some milk and stuff.

28:10.669 --> 28:13.103
''That the Father may be glorified...''

28:49.674 --> 28:51.699
( loud chattering )

28:53.812 --> 28:56.042
( Stone reading indistinctly )

29:01.219 --> 29:03.813
''...the embrace of sin, the individual

29:03.855 --> 29:07.313
achieves perfect metaphysical pitch

29:07.359 --> 29:09.156
and transforms himself

29:09.194 --> 29:12.322
into a tuning fork of God.''

29:18.036 --> 29:19.526
( yelling )

29:19.571 --> 29:22.768
l'm trying improve myself here,
you motherfuckers!

29:24.142 --> 29:28.442
( phone ringing )

29:33.685 --> 29:36.176
Jack's voice:
This is Jack and Madylyn Mabry.

29:36.221 --> 29:38.917
- Please leave a message.
- ( machine beeps )

29:38.957 --> 29:42.017
Hi. Hey, this is
Lucetta Creeson.

29:42.060 --> 29:45.154
Um, l called before.
l'm Stoney Creeson's wife.

29:45.197 --> 29:47.222
l spoke to Mrs. Mabry,

29:47.265 --> 29:49.529
but Mr. Mabry, this is for you.

29:49.568 --> 29:52.196
l would like to talk to you
about my husband.

29:52.237 --> 29:54.205
Um, it's kind of important to us.

29:54.239 --> 29:56.969
And l work most mornings, but--

29:57.008 --> 29:59.033
well, no, look,
l could rearrange things,

29:59.077 --> 30:01.875
so whenever's good for you
is fine with me.

30:01.913 --> 30:03.346
( beeps )

30:03.381 --> 30:05.474
Shit.

30:05.517 --> 30:07.781
l wasn't done.

30:08.987 --> 30:11.319
Who goes to sleep at 9:00?

30:24.469 --> 30:26.369
Hi.

30:51.463 --> 30:53.454
Lucetta: Mr. Mabry?

30:54.733 --> 30:57.998
- Officer Mabry?
- Sorry?

30:58.036 --> 31:01.528
Mrs. Creeson-- l'm Stoney's wife.

31:01.573 --> 31:03.666
Oh oh, Mrs. Creeson.

31:03.708 --> 31:05.505
Look, call me Lucetta though, please.

31:07.012 --> 31:09.071
You're here to see your husband?

31:09.114 --> 31:12.049
No, silly, l'm here to see you.

31:12.083 --> 31:15.143
Wait, l'm sorry,
didn't you get my message?

31:15.187 --> 31:19.180
Oh yeah, okay. Well, there's a way
to meet with family, Mrs. Creeson.

31:19.224 --> 31:21.784
You have to go through the office
for me to see you.

31:21.826 --> 31:24.522
- Oh right.
- The case officer too--

31:24.563 --> 31:27.430
meet and assess the home situation.

31:27.465 --> 31:30.059
- That's-that's how we--
- See, that's the thing though, sir,

31:30.101 --> 31:33.434
because, l mean,
l am the home situation.

31:35.273 --> 31:37.400
- Mrs. Creeson, just call the office--
- Lucetta.

31:37.442 --> 31:40.878
Lucetta. Just call the office
and make an appointment.

31:40.912 --> 31:43.642
- That's the way you have to do it.
- Can't l just talk to you for a while?

31:43.682 --> 31:46.879
l mean, can't we just, sort of just you
and me make a date or something?

31:46.918 --> 31:48.351
- No, we can't.
- Please please.

31:48.386 --> 31:49.819
You know how much
this means to us.

31:49.854 --> 31:53.312
lf you're coming to see your husband,
fine, but we can't do it any other way.

31:53.358 --> 31:55.690
And l'm late, really.

31:55.727 --> 31:57.922
Well, Mr. Mabry,

31:57.963 --> 32:00.227
Mr. Mabry, l wanted
to give you a little something

32:00.265 --> 32:02.426
- my kids made in class.
- Yeah, l can't accept that.

32:02.467 --> 32:05.368
- lt's inappropriate. Thank you anyway.
- But it's for the birds, see?

32:05.403 --> 32:08.497
And they-- it's a nest
and they come and they take their twine

32:08.540 --> 32:11.737
and their twigs and stuff
and they make their little home.

32:11.776 --> 32:13.334
Thank you.

32:13.378 --> 32:15.676
Lucetta: Okay.

32:15.714 --> 32:18.239
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

32:27.158 --> 32:29.023
Okay.

32:31.396 --> 32:33.694
What the hell is this?

32:33.732 --> 32:35.962
- What's that?
- This-- your wife.

32:36.001 --> 32:37.332
What, she sent it to you?

32:37.369 --> 32:39.633
She gave it to me
in the parking lot just now.

32:39.671 --> 32:41.832
Wait, what,
Lucetta come and find you?

32:41.873 --> 32:45.001
She gave that to me in the parking lot.
Don't mess with me.

32:45.043 --> 32:47.409
l ain't lookin' for any kind
of trouble with you, you know.

32:47.445 --> 32:49.470
l hope you didn't put her up to it.

32:49.514 --> 32:51.744
The parole board's
gonna send you a flop in the mail

32:51.783 --> 32:53.478
and you won't even see them.

32:53.518 --> 32:56.248
Lucetta does whatever
the fuck she wants. l told you, man.

32:56.288 --> 32:58.882
She's just boisterous.

33:02.527 --> 33:05.052
Jesus, what a week.

33:15.874 --> 33:18.365
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

33:18.410 --> 33:21.902
Hey hey, l want to see
what you think about something.

33:24.516 --> 33:26.381
You ever-- you seen this?

33:27.852 --> 33:29.547
l found it in the library.

33:29.587 --> 33:33.546
''Zukangor, The Sound and Life God.''

33:33.591 --> 33:35.081
Yeah, you know it?

33:36.227 --> 33:37.694
No.

33:37.729 --> 33:40.163
They say the sound part come first.

33:40.198 --> 33:42.894
They say the-- when you experience

33:42.934 --> 33:45.402
a spiritual truth

33:45.437 --> 33:48.497
that it comes to you as a sound,

33:48.540 --> 33:50.940
that it goes through you,

33:50.975 --> 33:54.274
changes your vibration,
gets you back into harmony.

33:54.312 --> 33:56.803
Like God's tuning fork or something.

33:56.848 --> 33:59.442
And then if you let that happen to you,

33:59.484 --> 34:02.146
then-- then you get the light,

34:02.187 --> 34:04.621
or you get illumination
or something.

34:06.091 --> 34:08.753
l wouldn't know about that.
l'm an Episcopalian.

34:08.793 --> 34:12.820
They say it starts with small things,
like little sounds, little vibrations,

34:12.864 --> 34:15.856
like a-- just like
a buzzing electric light

34:15.900 --> 34:19.460
or rushing water
or the sound of a bee or...

34:19.504 --> 34:21.495
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

34:21.539 --> 34:23.234
And then it grows.

34:23.274 --> 34:26.505
But there's no priest or nothing.
lt's not like a religion.

34:26.543 --> 34:31.072
There's just this one dude
named Arnold who's the Zukmaster.

34:31.116 --> 34:34.710
They say you do this practice
all by yourself.

34:34.753 --> 34:37.152
You can-- you can hear better.

34:37.188 --> 34:40.054
You can hear God
speaking to you through sounds.

34:40.091 --> 34:41.717
What's the practice?

34:41.760 --> 34:44.126
- They chant ''Hue.''
- Hue?

34:44.161 --> 34:47.255
- And then they listen.
- For what, a bee?

34:49.033 --> 34:50.762
Maybe, l don't know.

34:50.802 --> 34:53.362
( phone ringing in adjacent room )

34:53.405 --> 34:57.501
( chuckles )
But you know, the thing is

34:57.542 --> 35:00.443
they say you got to keep coming back

35:00.478 --> 35:03.345
until you pay for all your shit.

35:03.381 --> 35:05.849
That you've got to fix it

35:05.884 --> 35:09.251
over a lot of lives, you know,
until you work it all out.

35:09.287 --> 35:11.983
Well, what about this life?

35:12.023 --> 35:15.618
What about answering for the things
that you've done in this life?

35:19.497 --> 35:21.294
Shit, l know l have.

35:21.332 --> 35:23.266
Have you?

35:23.301 --> 35:24.825
Yeah. Have you?

35:30.175 --> 35:33.702
Male pastor: This is
the body of Christ, given for you.

35:33.745 --> 35:36.680
The body of Christ, given for you.

35:39.117 --> 35:41.984
The body of Christ, given for you.

35:42.020 --> 35:44.011
- Jack: l'll be right back.
- Pastor: Sure.

35:49.461 --> 35:51.019
Here, you drive home.

35:51.062 --> 35:53.826
l'm going to talk to the pastor
a minute and then l'll walk.

35:53.865 --> 35:55.526
Okay.

35:58.636 --> 36:00.661
- ( men chattering )
- Man: Hey yo, foul, bitch!

36:00.705 --> 36:02.434
Damn, that's a hard foul!

36:02.474 --> 36:04.499
Yo, that's a foul!

36:11.082 --> 36:13.175
( clears throat )

36:13.218 --> 36:16.085
( chanting )
Hue...

36:16.120 --> 36:18.145
( basketball game fading out )

36:24.329 --> 36:26.991
( basketball game grows louder )

36:27.031 --> 36:29.124
Man:
Man, you should've dunked it!

36:29.167 --> 36:31.101
( loud chattering )

36:40.378 --> 36:44.144
Jack: Okay, l've never
done this before, so--

36:44.182 --> 36:46.013
well, l mean, l come to the...

36:47.819 --> 36:50.617
church every week and l really try.

36:50.655 --> 36:53.783
And l don't know, l mean,
l guess l had hoped with time

36:53.825 --> 36:55.850
it would be easier and easier and...

36:57.495 --> 36:59.122
and l'd be...

37:01.332 --> 37:03.994
My family, people close to me,

37:04.035 --> 37:07.334
it seems to come to them easily,
but for me it's...

37:07.372 --> 37:10.068
l mean l've...

37:10.108 --> 37:11.598
l don't know.

37:14.612 --> 37:17.410
l mean l've...

37:17.448 --> 37:21.407
sometimes
the thoughts that l have,

37:21.452 --> 37:23.249
feelings...

37:25.356 --> 37:27.551
but, uh, sometimes

37:27.592 --> 37:30.652
l just think maybe
you should shoot me or something.

37:30.695 --> 37:33.755
Well, l don't believe that
that's what God wants for you.

37:33.798 --> 37:36.665
Well, what does he want?

37:36.701 --> 37:41.138
l wish l had a simple answer for you.

37:41.172 --> 37:43.868
l'm not sure what God wants for you.

37:45.843 --> 37:47.504
ls there anything...

37:49.647 --> 37:52.707
There's an old Biblical passage
that says...

37:54.586 --> 37:57.953
''Be still and know that l am God.''

37:57.989 --> 37:59.889
Which is a way of saying

37:59.924 --> 38:02.484
sometimes God does, um,

38:02.527 --> 38:05.724
speak to us in mysterious ways.

38:12.537 --> 38:14.528
( chattering )

38:19.377 --> 38:21.902
( meditative humming )

38:23.681 --> 38:25.308
Guard: Off the rail!

38:25.350 --> 38:27.147
l said off the rail!

38:37.762 --> 38:40.595
( chanting )
Hue...

38:47.138 --> 38:49.766
( phone rings )

38:51.342 --> 38:52.866
Hello?

38:52.910 --> 38:56.277
Lucetta: Hi, this is Lucetta Creeson.
We talked last week.

38:56.314 --> 38:58.748
Madylyn: l'm sorry,
what is your name again?

38:58.783 --> 39:00.808
Lucetta Creeson.

39:00.852 --> 39:03.377
l was just wondering
if Jack was home.

39:03.421 --> 39:06.083
l'm afraid he's still--
oh no, wait, hold on.

39:06.124 --> 39:09.560
- Jack, telephone.
- Who is it? Who? Who is it?

39:09.594 --> 39:11.289
A friend of yours?

39:12.630 --> 39:14.598
- Hello.
- Hey.

39:14.632 --> 39:16.429
lt's Lucetta Creeson.

39:16.467 --> 39:18.799
Listen, l was just wondering, um,

39:18.836 --> 39:21.031
when we could meet,
when we could get together.

39:21.072 --> 39:25.236
Uh, Mrs. Creeson, l don't know
how you're calling my house,

39:25.276 --> 39:26.937
but l told you to call the office.

39:26.978 --> 39:28.707
Lucetta: Well, look, l'm just,

39:28.746 --> 39:32.341
l'm not that great at offices
and, you know,

39:32.383 --> 39:35.819
l just-- l just can't be real, like,
in an office, you know?

39:35.853 --> 39:37.878
- Look, Mrs. Creeson--
- Lucetta.

39:37.922 --> 39:41.380
Mrs. Creeson, l have
business with your husband.

39:41.426 --> 39:43.690
Well, that's why l'm calling.

39:43.728 --> 39:45.855
l mean, what, did you think
l had another reason?

39:45.897 --> 39:47.626
Jack: Well, no, l didn't.

39:47.665 --> 39:50.725
Maybe we could go to lunch,
you could bring Mrs. Mabry too.

39:50.768 --> 39:53.601
You know, she's got a sweet voice.
What's her first name?

39:53.638 --> 39:55.401
Look, l admire
that you love your husband

39:55.440 --> 39:56.930
and you want to do
what's right for him,

39:56.974 --> 40:00.102
but you're not helping him.
l'm telling you that right now.

40:00.144 --> 40:02.112
( whispering seductively )
Listen to me, Jack.

40:02.146 --> 40:04.307
l do love my husband.

40:04.348 --> 40:06.282
l love my husband

40:06.317 --> 40:09.684
so much.

40:09.721 --> 40:11.450
( Lucetta moans )

40:11.489 --> 40:14.481
And all l'm asking you
is for a chance

40:14.525 --> 40:17.323
to help you see him
in a different light.

40:18.696 --> 40:21.221
l mean, how many men
at that place you work at

40:21.265 --> 40:24.666
have somebody
loving them like that, huh?

40:26.204 --> 40:28.502
Doesn't that mean something to you,

40:28.539 --> 40:31.235
a man in a position like yours?

40:31.275 --> 40:34.472
lt-it-- no, it-it does, it does.
Don't misunderstand me.

40:34.512 --> 40:37.174
( seductive whispering continues )
l just want him home.

40:37.215 --> 40:40.810
l want... l want him so bad.

40:40.852 --> 40:43.286
l want his arms around me.

40:43.321 --> 40:45.789
l want him in my bed.

40:45.823 --> 40:48.291
l miss him.

40:48.326 --> 40:50.624
Can't l persuade you?

40:50.661 --> 40:52.959
Who's it gonna hurt, hmm?

40:52.997 --> 40:56.228
Just let me come see you, please.

40:58.102 --> 41:00.195
Let me come see you, Jack.

41:02.039 --> 41:04.439
( breathing heavily )

41:07.411 --> 41:09.208
l got him.

41:09.247 --> 41:11.147
lt's gonna happen, baby.

41:15.052 --> 41:18.647
Huh. Honey, you okay?

41:18.689 --> 41:20.384
l'm so fuckin' tired.

41:21.993 --> 41:24.052
Can't you sleep?

41:24.095 --> 41:27.087
No, it's too loud all the time.

41:27.131 --> 41:29.224
So noisy l can't...

41:31.402 --> 41:33.063
l can't get out of my head.

41:33.104 --> 41:35.504
l can't hear nothin'.
l can't listen.

41:35.540 --> 41:38.304
This place is startin'
to mess with my head.

41:38.342 --> 41:41.869
l'm tellin' you, l'm having
these weird-ass dreams.

41:41.913 --> 41:43.881
Poor honey.

41:47.118 --> 41:50.087
l thought l wanted
to kill myself, right?

41:51.489 --> 41:54.549
Thought l wanted to hang myself
in the solitary.

41:54.592 --> 41:56.253
l don't get it.
You dreamed that?

41:56.294 --> 41:58.524
But then l got too scared to die

41:58.563 --> 42:02.124
and l just hung there
for all of eternity.

42:06.470 --> 42:09.064
l don't want to fuckin' be here.

42:14.312 --> 42:16.041
l don't want to fuckin' be here.

42:16.080 --> 42:18.105
Honey.

42:22.820 --> 42:25.380
Honey, what'd you have
to eat that night?

42:25.423 --> 42:28.256
lt must've been something.
Was it spicy?

42:30.494 --> 42:33.019
( basketball players chattering )

42:43.674 --> 42:46.609
- Man #1 : Shoot it!
- Man #2: All right, let's go.

42:52.850 --> 42:55.512
Woman #1 : That's the grandson
l've been tellin' you about right there.

42:55.553 --> 42:57.851
- Woman #2: How cute.
- Woman #1 : His eyes are so...

43:03.327 --> 43:05.124
l got a grandchild.

43:05.162 --> 43:06.925
Do you really?

43:06.964 --> 43:09.524
Yeah. Her name's Katie,
three years old.

43:09.567 --> 43:12.297
- Cute.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, very cute.

43:12.336 --> 43:14.133
Does she look like you?

43:14.171 --> 43:16.401
Hell no. No no no.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.601
l bet she loves you though.

43:18.643 --> 43:20.907
- Yeah well...
- You see her much?

43:23.681 --> 43:26.616
They live upstate,
so we don't see her that much.

43:26.651 --> 43:28.278
Aw, that's too bad.

43:31.355 --> 43:35.052
She's getting a divorce,
my daughter.

43:35.092 --> 43:37.856
- l'm sorry.
- What are you gonna do?

43:37.895 --> 43:39.920
People are gonna do
what they're gonna do.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.758
Are you in pain?

43:44.802 --> 43:46.326
Yeah, it's just my back.

43:46.370 --> 43:47.860
Oh. What'd you get that,

43:47.905 --> 43:49.736
playing ball or like from some war?

43:49.774 --> 43:51.401
No no, it's just life.

43:51.442 --> 43:54.138
So l don't know if l can--

43:54.178 --> 43:56.169
l don't want you to get your hopes up.

43:56.213 --> 43:57.771
About what?

43:57.815 --> 43:59.874
What l can do for you, for your husband.

43:59.917 --> 44:02.579
- There's a whole system--
- Have you tried magnet therapy?

44:02.620 --> 44:05.885
For your back, l mean. lt's like
these magnets that you wear and stuff.

44:05.923 --> 44:08.323
- Magnets?
- Yeah, it's really good.

44:08.359 --> 44:10.327
Actually, you should
come over sometime,

44:10.361 --> 44:13.353
because l got these insoles
this guy sold me

44:13.397 --> 44:15.092
and l wear 'em in my shoes

44:15.132 --> 44:17.396
and l don't get tired
in school or anything.

44:18.502 --> 44:20.026
And-- yeah, and sometimes

44:20.071 --> 44:22.835
l even put 'em under my pillow
before l go to sleep.

44:22.873 --> 44:24.397
And what does that do?

44:25.676 --> 44:27.473
Well, okay,

44:27.511 --> 44:29.979
you know how we're
all toxic and stuff, right,

44:30.014 --> 44:33.609
with like all the microwaves
and cell phones

44:33.651 --> 44:36.518
and all that weird stuff
flying through the air.

44:36.554 --> 44:39.114
So it all builds up
inside of you, right,

44:39.156 --> 44:41.215
and it makes you
all achy and upset--

44:41.258 --> 44:43.055
and it can give you
brain tumors, really--

44:43.094 --> 44:44.721
l mean, it kills people.

44:44.762 --> 44:47.424
So these magnets,
they detox you.

44:47.465 --> 44:50.093
- Wow, that's...
- Yeah, it's real. l believe it.

44:51.702 --> 44:53.329
You don't believe it?

44:53.371 --> 44:55.396
l don't know, l guess.

44:55.439 --> 44:57.339
No, it's real.

44:57.375 --> 45:00.208
l mean, look,
l'm all into the body, you know,

45:00.244 --> 45:02.769
and for me
if the body's feeling good,

45:02.813 --> 45:05.611
the mind just follows, you know?

45:05.649 --> 45:07.310
Absolutely.

45:07.351 --> 45:09.285
Egg?

45:09.320 --> 45:11.515
My kids made 'em.

45:11.555 --> 45:13.682
Now l got 'em all and l have to eat 'em.

45:13.724 --> 45:15.624
They're nice. They're pretty.

45:15.659 --> 45:17.183
Eat me please.

45:23.200 --> 45:24.895
Jack: Why not?

45:32.476 --> 45:34.444
l'm just eating the healthy part.

45:34.478 --> 45:37.970
Go on, just eat the whole thing.

45:38.015 --> 45:40.347
- ( door closes )
- ( inmates chattering )

45:43.454 --> 45:46.685
Creeson, what's up?
You haven't been to chow in two days.

45:46.724 --> 45:49.887
You got a call out to go to Medical.
Get dressed.

45:52.363 --> 45:54.695
( lights buzzing )

45:54.732 --> 45:56.461
Hold up there.

46:01.672 --> 46:03.936
( door buzzes )

46:08.312 --> 46:10.576
( keys jingling )

46:26.931 --> 46:28.922
( whispering )
You feel anything?

46:31.335 --> 46:33.098
No.

46:34.572 --> 46:36.802
Like a tingling?

46:38.776 --> 46:41.836
No, l don't.
l don't think l...

46:41.879 --> 46:44.143
Like a pull?

46:44.181 --> 46:45.842
lt's not dramatic, you know.

46:45.883 --> 46:49.216
lt's just-- it's kind of a sense.

46:50.788 --> 46:53.256
Yeah well, you know,
maybe a little something.

46:53.290 --> 46:55.053
Yeah.

46:56.494 --> 46:58.485
( clock ticking )

47:11.609 --> 47:14.578
( ticking continues )

47:29.793 --> 47:32.387
( ticking )

48:17.474 --> 48:19.567
( lights buzzing )

48:31.522 --> 48:33.387
( grunting )

48:37.027 --> 48:38.585
( screams )

49:30.681 --> 49:32.672
( echoing scream )

49:57.908 --> 50:00.433
( buzzing lights fading out )

50:21.198 --> 50:24.395
Madylyn: ''To what extent is
my commitment to obey God

50:24.435 --> 50:26.198
based on dos and don'ts

50:26.236 --> 50:29.364
or on a true love for Him?''

50:29.406 --> 50:32.170
Hmm.

50:32.209 --> 50:35.975
''ln what recent circumstance
was l aware of God's leading?''

50:38.649 --> 50:40.446
Why don't you say the blessing?

50:42.353 --> 50:44.617
Yeah.

50:44.655 --> 50:46.384
Blessed O Lord...

50:46.423 --> 50:49.256
( clears throat )

50:49.293 --> 50:51.454
blessed O Lord,

50:51.495 --> 50:56.159
this food to our use,
and us to Thy loving service,

50:56.200 --> 50:59.226
and...

50:59.269 --> 51:02.136
make us mindful
of the needs of others...

51:05.709 --> 51:08.234
- ln Christ's name, Amen.
- Amen.

51:11.148 --> 51:13.116
You lose your place?

51:13.150 --> 51:15.209
( chuckles )

51:15.252 --> 51:17.277
( spoon clangs )

51:17.321 --> 51:19.482
You want an egg?

51:24.294 --> 51:26.728
( chattering )

51:43.680 --> 51:46.410
( chattering fades )

52:10.707 --> 52:14.336
Male radio host: Sin comes
naturally to us from our birth.

52:14.378 --> 52:17.245
We-we-- it's inbred in us.

52:17.281 --> 52:20.444
We are not sinners
because we sin;

52:20.484 --> 52:24.113
we sin because we are sinners.

52:24.154 --> 52:28.488
Even if you lived a life
of perfect righteousness,

52:28.525 --> 52:30.425
you deserve hell.
You know why?

52:30.461 --> 52:33.919
Because ''all of our
righteousnesses,'' lsaiah says,

52:33.964 --> 52:35.659
''are as filthy rags.''

52:35.699 --> 52:37.633
( turns off car, radio )

53:23.947 --> 53:25.437
( panting )

53:25.482 --> 53:27.814
You're real sweet, Jack.

53:29.119 --> 53:30.950
You're real sweet.

53:32.656 --> 53:34.624
Fuck me harder.

54:08.492 --> 54:10.926
( man laughing )

54:18.168 --> 54:20.500
You're good, Jack.

54:21.805 --> 54:24.330
You're a good man
for helping us.

54:26.143 --> 54:28.634
l appreciate it.

54:34.284 --> 54:36.445
You know that
nobody can know about this.

54:36.486 --> 54:38.249
You know that, right?

54:38.288 --> 54:39.949
l mean nobody.

54:39.990 --> 54:42.083
That's very important.

54:42.125 --> 54:46.391
Whatever you want,
it'll all go bad if anybody knows.

54:46.430 --> 54:49.627
Bad for everybody,
you understand that?

54:49.666 --> 54:51.497
Of course, silly.

55:35.412 --> 55:37.676
What's wrong?
You're not eating?

55:41.051 --> 55:44.646
You ever think about things
they say go on forever?

55:44.688 --> 55:46.485
What?

55:46.523 --> 55:49.219
Things they say
go on forever-- like...

55:50.994 --> 55:53.121
what's that mean, you know?

55:54.765 --> 55:58.360
The sky, like, they say
the sky goes on forever.

55:59.736 --> 56:02.136
But what is that really? That's--

56:02.172 --> 56:05.699
l mean, you can't see
nothing you can't see, so...

56:07.711 --> 56:09.702
it's like a big bowl
of blue above you.

56:09.746 --> 56:11.611
You can see clouds
during the day

56:11.648 --> 56:13.741
or you can see stars
at night maybe,

56:13.784 --> 56:16.412
but even with a telescope
you can't see forever.

56:16.453 --> 56:18.148
So how do they know?

56:20.991 --> 56:22.652
Know what?

56:22.693 --> 56:24.820
What it is.

56:24.861 --> 56:27.193
Eternity-- how do they know?

56:35.305 --> 56:38.035
So-- so, Jack,

56:38.075 --> 56:42.011
he said the board's gonna review
the whole thing, okay?

56:42.045 --> 56:44.570
And they're going
to take into consideration

56:44.614 --> 56:47.947
your age and, you know,

56:47.984 --> 56:50.976
your mom and all that,

56:51.021 --> 56:54.752
and the fact that
you were an addict back then, um...

56:56.460 --> 56:59.293
- hey, Stoney baby?
- Hmm?

56:59.329 --> 57:01.456
Look at me.

57:04.034 --> 57:07.629
Well, l was trying to tell you
about your parole.

57:07.671 --> 57:09.696
Yeah?

57:09.740 --> 57:11.731
( sighs )

57:13.376 --> 57:15.606
Well, you weren't listening.

57:15.645 --> 57:19.308
Oh yeah, l'm listening.

57:19.349 --> 57:22.011
l am.

57:22.052 --> 57:25.453
Okay, so Jack said, um--

57:25.489 --> 57:27.389
You call him Jack?

57:27.424 --> 57:28.948
Sure.

57:30.026 --> 57:32.824
That's good.
What's he say?

57:34.865 --> 57:38.301
Okay, so, um,
he's gonna talk to you

57:38.335 --> 57:40.997
and he's going over
the whole thing

57:41.037 --> 57:44.837
and he's gonna decide in a few days
to write up his notes in your case file

57:44.875 --> 57:47.810
to submit it to the parole commission
so when they go over it next week

57:47.844 --> 57:49.903
they're gonna see it.
lsn't that great, baby?

57:51.581 --> 57:54.141
Honey, this could be it.
lsn't that great?

57:58.922 --> 58:00.719
Yeah.

58:05.495 --> 58:08.328
Didn't-didn't-didn't l do good?

58:11.835 --> 58:14.099
Well, look at me.

58:14.137 --> 58:15.798
( Stone groans )

58:17.407 --> 58:19.807
What are you doing?

58:19.843 --> 58:21.936
Sometimes l think the best thing is...

58:23.446 --> 58:26.074
is just-just listen.

58:33.223 --> 58:35.123
Would you stop playin'?

58:37.093 --> 58:37.127
Radio: ls the kingdom of heav-- you think it
should be a peaceful kingdom

58:37.127 --> 58:39.925
Radio: ls the kingdom of heav-- you think it
should be a peaceful kingdom

58:39.963 --> 58:42.830
- and we should all get along?
- That's great, but is it just going

58:42.866 --> 58:45.266
- to be a constant struggle...
- That's a tough one.

58:45.302 --> 58:47.429
...to have the kingdom of heaven
here on earth?

58:47.470 --> 58:50.030
( overlapping radio broadcasts )

58:54.644 --> 58:56.043
Guard: Crack 53!

59:03.653 --> 59:06.121
Just tell me,
is it the 30th or the 31st?

59:06.156 --> 59:07.680
l've had about enough lip from you!

59:07.724 --> 59:09.248
God damn it, just tell me,
which one is it?

59:09.292 --> 59:11.726
You can button that up right now
and be nice. And l mean it.

59:20.203 --> 59:21.795
Creeson's here.

59:21.838 --> 59:24.398
Stone: How do ask a person to...

59:24.441 --> 59:27.069
to explain something that--

59:27.110 --> 59:29.442
that they experienced

59:29.479 --> 59:31.276
to where another person's got no way

59:31.314 --> 59:34.841
to relate to the whole
indefiniteness of it, you know?

59:36.720 --> 59:38.620
You don't believe me
already, do you?

59:38.655 --> 59:40.850
l'm not saying l don't believe you.
l just, you know, l--

59:40.891 --> 59:42.722
look, l've seen the tape,
it's quite a thing.

59:42.759 --> 59:46.593
But nothing happened to you.
l mean, you weren't involved in any way.

59:46.630 --> 59:50.259
Yeah, look, l don't know how to even--

59:50.300 --> 59:54.532
- ( phones ringing in distance )
- l'm not--

59:54.571 --> 59:56.732
l don't know. l--

59:56.773 --> 59:58.968
You had, what, a profound

59:59.009 --> 01:00:02.308
spiritual epiphany.

01:00:02.345 --> 01:00:05.007
Shit, man, l ain't never even
heard that word before.

01:00:05.048 --> 01:00:07.676
Look, we don't have to talk about it.

01:00:07.717 --> 01:00:09.981
You know, it really don't matter.

01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:12.113
Well...

01:00:12.155 --> 01:00:15.420
l mean, don't get me wrong, l'd
like to believe in such things, but--

01:00:15.458 --> 01:00:17.358
Like what? Like me?
You believe in me?

01:00:17.394 --> 01:00:20.693
Sure, l'd like to believe in you too.
l mean that's why we're all here, right?

01:00:26.269 --> 01:00:28.499
Wow.

01:00:29.773 --> 01:00:32.503
Okay, you know, wait, look,

01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:34.442
there were something like...

01:00:36.212 --> 01:00:38.373
it was just a moment.

01:00:38.415 --> 01:00:40.542
The static,

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:43.108
it just all went away, you know?

01:00:43.153 --> 01:00:44.643
And l could really hear,

01:00:44.688 --> 01:00:47.282
like l could hear clear, for real.

01:00:47.324 --> 01:00:51.351
l don't know. lt just made me
see everything different.

01:00:51.394 --> 01:00:54.795
lt made me look
at my life in a different way.

01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:57.493
lt was just all of a sudden
l could-- l could see that

01:00:57.534 --> 01:01:01.402
my life in here isn't empty and
pointless like l thought it was before.

01:01:03.139 --> 01:01:04.629
Woman: Family and...

01:01:08.044 --> 01:01:11.878
- Look, Stone, just drop it.
- Drop what?

01:01:11.915 --> 01:01:13.610
Well, l know what
you're trying to do, but don't.

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:16.847
Just-just-just don't.
lt's not helping. Just stop.

01:01:16.886 --> 01:01:19.150
Hey look, man,

01:01:19.189 --> 01:01:21.851
it don't matter to me no more.

01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:24.416
- What doesn't matter?
- l don't care about what--

01:01:24.461 --> 01:01:27.726
what you're doin' or what anybody else
is tryin' to make you do.

01:01:27.764 --> 01:01:31.222
Make me do? What's that?
Nobody's trying to make me do anything.

01:01:32.335 --> 01:01:34.701
Okay.

01:01:36.306 --> 01:01:40.402
You should do what
you think is right, okay?

01:01:40.443 --> 01:01:43.469
l am whatever you say l am in there,
so write what you feel.

01:01:43.513 --> 01:01:46.949
Seriously. l mean it.
l mean, judge me how you think.

01:01:46.983 --> 01:01:49.144
- Well...
- l mean, don't get me wrong,

01:01:49.185 --> 01:01:51.176
l want to be out,

01:01:51.221 --> 01:01:54.190
but l'm gonna wrestle
with the same shit if l'm out.

01:01:54.224 --> 01:01:56.886
And l'm gonna keep
this feeling if l'm in.

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:02.125
Jack:
So you're all good now?

01:02:02.165 --> 01:02:06.261
Stone: No no no. Look, l ain't sayin'
l'm all happy all of a sudden.

01:02:06.302 --> 01:02:08.770
You know, my middle finger's
been up a long time, man.

01:02:08.805 --> 01:02:11.865
l'm not just gonna start wavin'
and smilin' at people.

01:02:11.908 --> 01:02:15.036
l'm gonna pop off.
l'm gonna lose my temper, and--

01:02:15.078 --> 01:02:18.377
and say shit and do shit
that l'm gonna regret, whatever.

01:02:18.415 --> 01:02:21.384
l just-- l just--
l am who l am, you know?

01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:24.717
And that's okay.
You know what l'm sayin'?

01:02:24.754 --> 01:02:27.279
Jack:
No. No, l'm afraid l don't.

01:02:27.323 --> 01:02:30.121
Stone: Well, l told you
l couldn't explain it really.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.355
- Madylyn: Are you okay?
- Yeah. My back.

01:02:32.395 --> 01:02:35.296
- l'm gonna go sleep in the other room.
- Oh.

01:02:35.331 --> 01:02:37.891
Male radio host:
You can take great comfort in that,

01:02:37.934 --> 01:02:39.834
but that can be a false comfort.

01:02:39.869 --> 01:02:42.895
Sometimes in the twilight
of a civilization,

01:02:42.939 --> 01:02:45.339
there can be a great
cultural flowering,

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:49.004
but in reality, there are cracks
in the foundation of that society

01:02:49.045 --> 01:02:50.512
and that society is doomed.

01:03:12.135 --> 01:03:14.660
lf you really want to know,

01:03:14.704 --> 01:03:18.299
l think it's some kind of
play-acting or something.

01:03:18.341 --> 01:03:20.070
lt's all bullshit?

01:03:20.110 --> 01:03:24.479
No. No. Look, Stoney's just...

01:03:24.514 --> 01:03:26.414
you know.
l mean, he's screwed up.

01:03:26.449 --> 01:03:28.940
He's got weird ideas about things.

01:03:28.985 --> 01:03:31.818
Sometimes really weird.

01:03:31.855 --> 01:03:34.915
But, l mean,
he's always been that way.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:38.826
Jack: Talkin' to him,

01:03:38.862 --> 01:03:40.853
he almost seemed like...

01:03:40.897 --> 01:03:42.990
Like what?

01:03:43.032 --> 01:03:46.559
Something-- really,
l don't know. Different.

01:03:46.603 --> 01:03:49.697
( chuckles )
No.

01:03:49.739 --> 01:03:53.800
Look, he's just trying
to impress you, you know,

01:03:53.843 --> 01:03:56.505
trying to do whatever
it takes to get out.

01:03:56.546 --> 01:03:58.673
Can you blame him?

01:03:58.715 --> 01:04:00.945
- No, it's okay.
- What?

01:04:02.051 --> 01:04:04.042
Hey, sit down.

01:04:04.087 --> 01:04:06.885
Come on. Come on, sit down.

01:04:06.923 --> 01:04:08.584
Sit down.

01:04:12.562 --> 01:04:16.123
Look, he admires you a lot,
you know.

01:04:16.166 --> 01:04:18.930
He told me
he learned a lot talking to you.

01:04:22.105 --> 01:04:25.268
Can you be straight?

01:04:25.308 --> 01:04:27.242
Straight as you.

01:04:28.511 --> 01:04:30.206
ls this all just a-- l mean,

01:04:30.246 --> 01:04:32.908
just-just-just
tell me what's going on.

01:04:35.952 --> 01:04:39.046
l don't do anything
l don't want to do.

01:04:41.858 --> 01:04:43.553
l like you.

01:04:43.593 --> 01:04:45.686
l like you, Jack.

01:04:46.796 --> 01:04:50.630
l would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:53.227
Well, thanks.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.838
God, you're beautiful, you know.

01:05:02.645 --> 01:05:04.806
You're beautiful.

01:05:04.847 --> 01:05:06.678
Thank you.

01:05:11.087 --> 01:05:13.055
l'm not gonna
come over here anymore.

01:05:13.089 --> 01:05:14.852
- You're not?
- No.

01:05:14.891 --> 01:05:16.153
Okay.

01:05:16.192 --> 01:05:17.784
Maybe l should just take

01:05:17.827 --> 01:05:20.489
some antidepressants
or something, l don't know.

01:05:22.665 --> 01:05:25.225
- Yes you will.
- What?

01:05:25.268 --> 01:05:27.031
lt's okay though.

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:29.265
l don't mind when they say,
''Oh no, no more,''

01:05:29.305 --> 01:05:31.933
'cause then l just sit back and wait.

01:05:31.975 --> 01:05:35.001
( chuckles )

01:05:35.044 --> 01:05:36.978
But you'll call,

01:05:37.013 --> 01:05:38.708
won't you, or drop by?

01:05:38.748 --> 01:05:41.979
Like maybe late again
some night, won't you?

01:05:42.018 --> 01:05:44.111
Oh God.

01:05:45.121 --> 01:05:47.681
Look, l don't care if you deny it.
lt's funny to me.

01:05:49.359 --> 01:05:50.826
St-stop this now.

01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:55.263
l think about you so much, Jack.
All day long l'm thinking about you.

01:05:55.298 --> 01:05:57.266
l think about you at work.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.530
Don't say that.

01:05:59.569 --> 01:06:01.901
You're sexy, Jack,

01:06:01.938 --> 01:06:03.701
and you know if you let Stone out,

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:06.436
we can still be friends too.
He won't know.

01:06:06.476 --> 01:06:08.341
He won't even care.

01:06:08.378 --> 01:06:11.313
Look, l do what l do
because l'm on my own, okay?

01:06:11.347 --> 01:06:13.941
And l got to make my own way,
so don't you want to help us?

01:06:13.983 --> 01:06:16.781
- Don't you want to help me?
- Don't talk like that.

01:06:16.819 --> 01:06:19.344
l can't.
lt's not that simple.

01:06:24.627 --> 01:06:27.994
You can't leave, can you?

01:06:31.301 --> 01:06:33.326
lt's sweet.

01:06:36.306 --> 01:06:39.469
What the hell am l doing?
God damn it.

01:06:39.509 --> 01:06:42.535
Oh, come on, Jack.
He's a good man at heart.

01:06:42.578 --> 01:06:44.978
You really believe that?

01:06:45.014 --> 01:06:47.244
Yeah, l do.

01:06:47.283 --> 01:06:49.547
No different than you and me.

01:06:50.787 --> 01:06:52.414
Do you go to church?

01:06:52.455 --> 01:06:55.913
Hell no.
There's no such thing as God.

01:07:44.207 --> 01:07:46.334
( dialing )

01:07:46.376 --> 01:07:48.970
They called again.
They need the Creeson report.

01:07:49.011 --> 01:07:50.501
l just sent it!

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:53.276
You don't have to yell.
l'm on the intercom.

01:07:53.316 --> 01:07:56.945
You got your RGC recommendation.

01:07:56.986 --> 01:07:59.113
Vocational counseling,

01:07:59.155 --> 01:08:02.921
psych therapy,
GED, NA, NA program.

01:08:02.959 --> 01:08:05.826
So the board needs to decide

01:08:05.862 --> 01:08:08.524
if it's safe to let you back
into the world,

01:08:08.564 --> 01:08:10.794
that you're not a danger
to yourself or others.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:13.028
Rehabilitated, right?

01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:14.696
Yeah.

01:08:14.737 --> 01:08:16.398
You know, in my book it says

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:20.535
that chronic neck pain comes
from bein' hanged in another life.

01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:23.602
Well, it's my back.
lt's not my neck.

01:08:23.645 --> 01:08:25.944
Well, l'm just makin' conversation.

01:08:27.383 --> 01:08:29.544
Look, if you're
not interested in the details

01:08:29.585 --> 01:08:31.314
of your hearing, we're done here.

01:08:31.354 --> 01:08:33.151
- Done?
- We're done.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:36.386
- How do you mean we're done?
- My report's already sent. We're done.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.462
Basically they want to hear that you
take responsibility for your actions.

01:08:54.076 --> 01:08:56.840
See, the thing about that,
l don't know.

01:08:58.514 --> 01:09:00.448
About what?

01:09:00.483 --> 01:09:04.977
lt's funny, you know, 'cause you're
always askin' me about that night--

01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.886
how it made me feel.

01:09:11.359 --> 01:09:13.988
You know, when my cousin
come out of the house

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:17.557
and got me
and we went back inside...

01:09:19.068 --> 01:09:22.469
it was trippy, man,
because like two minutes before,

01:09:22.505 --> 01:09:24.564
you know, my poppy,

01:09:24.607 --> 01:09:27.404
he was-- he was alive.
There was color in his face.

01:09:27.443 --> 01:09:29.434
There was light in his eyes.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:32.970
And then l go inside there and...

01:09:38.287 --> 01:09:40.915
and then l see them

01:09:40.957 --> 01:09:44.154
lyin' there all over everywhere.

01:09:48.430 --> 01:09:51.867
There was this buzzing
in my ears, you know,

01:09:51.901 --> 01:09:54.392
and l thought it was
just the shit that we was on,

01:09:54.437 --> 01:09:56.997
but it kept growin'

01:09:57.039 --> 01:09:59.769
and it started scarin'
the shit out of me.

01:09:59.809 --> 01:10:01.868
Teach was bouncin' off the walls,

01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:04.402
yellin' at me,
''We got to do something,

01:10:04.447 --> 01:10:06.642
You gotta help me.
We gotta handle this.''

01:10:06.682 --> 01:10:09.776
But all l could hear
in my head was this sound.

01:10:12.021 --> 01:10:15.923
And then,
l don't know how l knew,

01:10:15.958 --> 01:10:19.894
but l just knew that
there needed to be a fire.

01:10:19.929 --> 01:10:21.988
l went to the garage.

01:10:22.031 --> 01:10:24.226
l got the can of gasoline

01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:26.030
and l got the match

01:10:26.068 --> 01:10:28.036
and l lit it.

01:10:31.574 --> 01:10:34.668
You ever seen a fire
take control?

01:10:34.710 --> 01:10:37.838
lt's somethin', man.
lt's alive.

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.144
And l watched it

01:10:40.182 --> 01:10:43.117
take them up

01:10:43.152 --> 01:10:45.848
and start to change them.

01:10:47.523 --> 01:10:50.390
And the only thought
that came in my head

01:10:52.028 --> 01:10:55.054
was ''This is awesome.''

01:10:55.097 --> 01:10:57.122
Awesome?

01:10:57.166 --> 01:10:59.100
Stone: Yeah.

01:11:00.503 --> 01:11:02.767
lt was

01:11:02.805 --> 01:11:04.796
truly awesome.

01:11:06.809 --> 01:11:11.041
Um, the thing is that

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.244
l know l'm supposed to take
responsibility for my action,

01:11:15.284 --> 01:11:19.277
l know that l'm supposed
to feel guilty about it,

01:11:19.322 --> 01:11:22.849
but l never did.

01:11:22.892 --> 01:11:24.792
And l never knew why.

01:11:26.696 --> 01:11:29.995
But now l think
l can understand

01:11:30.032 --> 01:11:32.057
that it was just

01:11:32.101 --> 01:11:34.194
part of what was
supposed to happen

01:11:34.236 --> 01:11:37.569
in my life's journey,

01:11:37.607 --> 01:11:39.268
you know?

01:11:39.308 --> 01:11:41.640
That was your decision--
you did that.

01:11:41.677 --> 01:11:43.167
No, l'm not sayin' l didn't.

01:11:43.212 --> 01:11:46.238
l'm saying that we're all
God's co-workers,

01:11:46.282 --> 01:11:48.250
and we don't even know it.

01:11:48.284 --> 01:11:50.252
Your crime
has nothin' to do with God.

01:11:50.286 --> 01:11:52.516
Why not?
God is everything.

01:11:52.555 --> 01:11:55.285
You know,
look at earthquakes and floods,

01:11:55.324 --> 01:11:58.555
and-and tornadoes,
and all the bad shit that happens--

01:11:58.594 --> 01:12:01.461
why don't you think that
we're a part of all of that too?

01:12:01.497 --> 01:12:04.432
What we do, you know,
the shit that we carry with us

01:12:04.467 --> 01:12:06.492
from one life to the next,

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:09.732
maybe there's a plan
that includes all of us--

01:12:09.772 --> 01:12:11.967
you and me and my grandparents,

01:12:12.008 --> 01:12:14.602
and we just don't know it.
How can we know?

01:12:14.644 --> 01:12:16.908
Enough of this shit.
You know-- you know--

01:12:16.946 --> 01:12:18.914
you and Lucetta,

01:12:18.948 --> 01:12:21.041
- she said that you were--
- Lucetta?

01:12:21.083 --> 01:12:22.846
- Your wife--
- What, you call her Lucetta?

01:12:22.885 --> 01:12:24.853
- She said--
- Don't.

01:12:24.887 --> 01:12:27.048
- What?
- Don't listen to her.

01:12:27.089 --> 01:12:28.420
What do you mean?

01:12:28.457 --> 01:12:31.585
Don't listen to what
she's tellin' you, man.

01:12:33.295 --> 01:12:35.229
Well, she believes in you.

01:12:35.264 --> 01:12:37.596
Look, it's a game to her, man.

01:12:37.633 --> 01:12:39.123
lt's a game. She--

01:12:39.168 --> 01:12:41.159
l told you in the beginning,
she's an alien.

01:12:41.203 --> 01:12:42.932
She's a-- she's like a freak.

01:12:42.972 --> 01:12:44.530
That's not a nice thing to say.

01:12:44.573 --> 01:12:46.973
No, listen, l'm tellin' it
to you straight, okay,

01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:48.704
she's just workin' on you.

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:51.338
She's workin' on you.
She's fuckin' you over, man.

01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:52.870
She's an animal.

01:12:52.915 --> 01:12:56.112
You know, you're fuckin' nuts,
you know that?

01:12:56.152 --> 01:12:57.642
You're fuckin' nuts.

01:12:57.687 --> 01:12:59.621
You got a beautiful wife
who cares about you, and--

01:12:59.655 --> 01:13:02.749
Beautiful?
You think she's beautiful?

01:13:06.996 --> 01:13:09.590
Okay, you're a con.
l've known that from the fuckin' start.

01:13:09.632 --> 01:13:12.829
l don't believe you for one
fuckin' second. Never did, never did.

01:13:12.868 --> 01:13:15.393
So you've both been
conning me? Okay, l know.

01:13:15.438 --> 01:13:18.896
l've been around the block a few times.
l ought to know better.

01:13:20.109 --> 01:13:22.703
- l'm sick and fuckin' tired of it.
- What'd l say, man?

01:13:22.745 --> 01:13:24.235
( Jack stammers )

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.305
You expect me to eat this new shit
you've been handing out?

01:13:26.348 --> 01:13:28.578
Write a nice little note about
your goddamn fucking epiphany?

01:13:28.617 --> 01:13:30.107
You're the same bastard
you've always been.

01:13:30.152 --> 01:13:31.744
- ( muttering )
- l know l am.

01:13:31.787 --> 01:13:34.950
That's what l've been sayin', man.

01:13:34.990 --> 01:13:37.424
- You don't get it.
- Get it? Oh no no, l got it.

01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:39.587
l got it and l'm goddamn
fuckin' fed up with you.

01:13:39.628 --> 01:13:41.562
The both of you
can go to hell for all l care.

01:13:41.597 --> 01:13:45.260
l can't f-- what have l done?
Jesus Christ, l've been--

01:13:45.301 --> 01:13:48.737
l mean, just goddamn
year in and year out

01:13:48.771 --> 01:13:51.740
sitting across the desk from this
and we pretend we're doing something,

01:13:51.774 --> 01:13:53.605
you pretend you've heard us
and then we fall for it.

01:13:53.642 --> 01:13:55.303
And then you come back in one year

01:13:55.344 --> 01:13:58.643
and you're sitting right back here
across the same desk from us again

01:13:58.681 --> 01:14:01.775
and somebody out there is hurt or dead.
Well, l'm not buyin' it anymore.

01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:04.615
Nothin' changed for the better. lt's all
bullshit. No one changes for the better.

01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:06.951
l've spent my whole fuckin' adult life
doin' this goddamn bullshit.

01:14:06.989 --> 01:14:09.287
l'm sick to death
of this whole fuckin' waste.

01:14:09.325 --> 01:14:11.156
You get no more of my time, pal.

01:14:11.193 --> 01:14:13.491
Get the hell out of here. Come on.

01:14:13.529 --> 01:14:15.793
Let's go. Come on, get out.

01:14:15.831 --> 01:14:18.129
Okay.

01:14:18.167 --> 01:14:20.567
( Stone mutters )
Oh God. Oh God.

01:14:20.603 --> 01:14:22.662
Hey, man, you have anyone?

01:14:22.705 --> 01:14:25.538
- What?
- Anybody to stand behind you.

01:14:25.574 --> 01:14:27.041
- Are you all alone?
- l'm not--

01:14:27.076 --> 01:14:30.170
Blow your motherfuckin' life up, man.
Blow it up all the way. Do it.

01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:32.043
Really, take it all the way.
lt helps.

01:14:32.081 --> 01:14:33.946
Hey, Peterson, we're done.

01:14:33.983 --> 01:14:35.974
Just go ahead and burn
your motherfuckin' life.

01:14:36.018 --> 01:14:38.748
- Now, God damn it!
- Blow it up. Let it go, all of it.

01:14:38.788 --> 01:14:40.278
Did anybody not fucking hear me?

01:14:40.322 --> 01:14:41.812
- Let's go, please!
- Go all the way.

01:14:41.857 --> 01:14:44.121
- Secretary: He's coming!
- Just embrace it, man. Burn it up.

01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:46.594
- Get him the hell out of here.
- lt's awesome. l'm pullin' for you.

01:14:46.629 --> 01:14:49.792
- No, really, l'm pullin' for you.
- Fuck you, you sick son of a bitch.

01:14:49.832 --> 01:14:52.027
( insects buzzing )

01:15:00.176 --> 01:15:02.440
( insects buzzing, crickets chirping )

01:15:05.147 --> 01:15:08.048
( phone ringing )

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.712
( beeps )

01:15:12.755 --> 01:15:15.053
Jack's voice: This is Jack and Madylyn
Mabry. Please leave a message.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:16.421
( beeps )

01:15:16.458 --> 01:15:18.688
Lucetta:
Hey, Jack-- Mr. Mabry,

01:15:18.727 --> 01:15:21.890
l left messages at work,
but you didn't call me back.

01:15:23.098 --> 01:15:25.157
l'm kind of in the dark here.

01:15:26.836 --> 01:15:29.430
Don't leave me dangling.
l hate that.

01:15:29.471 --> 01:15:31.769
( phone line clicks )

01:15:34.276 --> 01:15:36.938
( rings )

01:15:36.979 --> 01:15:38.970
Madylyn:
Let the machine get it.

01:15:40.216 --> 01:15:42.582
( rings )

01:15:46.088 --> 01:15:48.522
( rings )

01:15:52.361 --> 01:15:54.295
- ( rings )
- Hello?

01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:57.094
Woman:
ls Mom there?

01:15:57.132 --> 01:15:59.464
lt's Candace.

01:16:05.574 --> 01:16:08.441
Hey, it's Mom. Mm-hmm.

01:16:09.645 --> 01:16:11.943
Yeah, l understand.

01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:14.142
What's up?

01:16:14.183 --> 01:16:16.014
Well, how's Katie?

01:16:30.132 --> 01:16:32.396
Madylyn: Did you know
you started out as a stone?

01:16:32.434 --> 01:16:34.425
Jack: Hmm?

01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:36.267
Madylyn:
Your soul-- it started out

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:38.773
as a mineral or a pebble,

01:16:38.807 --> 01:16:41.833
and then it was reincarnated
as a plant,

01:16:41.877 --> 01:16:45.745
then as a fish, birds,
animals and so on.

01:16:45.781 --> 01:16:47.976
You had to work
your way up to being a human.

01:16:48.017 --> 01:16:50.918
- ( flies buzzing )
- Know what it's been doing, your soul?

01:16:50.953 --> 01:16:53.888
- Jack: Hmm, what?
- lt's been paying off debts--

01:16:53.923 --> 01:16:56.585
past sins from past lives,

01:16:56.625 --> 01:16:59.958
reducing its burden
from one life to the next.

01:17:06.068 --> 01:17:09.128
Where'd you get that?

01:17:09.171 --> 01:17:11.469
Junk mail.

01:17:18.814 --> 01:17:20.873
You know what l think?

01:17:20.916 --> 01:17:23.714
l think we get this one life,
l do, and...

01:17:25.721 --> 01:17:27.712
you account
for what you've done in it.

01:17:27.756 --> 01:17:30.884
And if you don't,
you pay for it when you die.

01:17:31.994 --> 01:17:33.985
You don't think?

01:17:35.597 --> 01:17:37.758
( exhales )

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:40.132
Shit.

01:17:40.169 --> 01:17:43.332
Shit shit, son of a bitch.

01:17:43.372 --> 01:17:46.500
Fuck fuck.

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.203
- Okay, l get it.
- Motherfucker.

01:17:48.243 --> 01:17:51.406
Why don't you make me another
fucking drink, you cocksucker?

01:17:51.447 --> 01:17:53.312
( Jack chuckles )

01:17:59.288 --> 01:18:01.256
Who is that?

01:18:04.693 --> 01:18:06.024
Hello.

01:18:06.061 --> 01:18:07.926
l'll take care of this.

01:18:09.131 --> 01:18:11.099
Will you just pick up
the phone sometimes?

01:18:11.133 --> 01:18:13.693
- Oh, Mrs. Creeson, please, really.
- Pick up the phone when you're here?

01:18:13.736 --> 01:18:15.499
- This is inappropriate.
- Hi, Mrs. Mabry.

01:18:15.537 --> 01:18:17.505
- Did you get my messages, Mrs. Mabry?
- Look, l'm sorry, please.

01:18:17.539 --> 01:18:19.666
Young lady, l'm going
to take you to your car. Let's go.

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:22.040
- Look, l'm a little bit worried.
- l don't care if you've been worried.

01:18:22.077 --> 01:18:24.511
You've been worried? l understand
if you're worried, Mrs. Creeson,

01:18:24.546 --> 01:18:27.572
but try and have a little patience. Get
in the fucking car and get out of here.

01:18:27.616 --> 01:18:29.379
What's wrong with you?
Why are you being like this?

01:18:29.418 --> 01:18:31.215
And what's wrong
with my husband, huh?

01:18:31.253 --> 01:18:32.311
Please--

01:18:32.354 --> 01:18:34.914
- You're not supposed to be here.
- What did you tell him about us?

01:18:34.957 --> 01:18:36.822
There is no us.
Get the fuck out of here.

01:18:36.859 --> 01:18:39.384
- l just needed a friend to talk to.
- Thank you, Mrs. Creeson.

01:18:39.428 --> 01:18:41.555
You've got no fucking idea, man.

01:18:41.597 --> 01:18:43.622
We'll talk at the prison.

01:18:54.043 --> 01:18:55.874
Fucking idiot.

01:18:59.548 --> 01:19:02.847
lnexcusable,
coming to our home like that.

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:13.254
You know, we can't alter reports
once they've been submitted for review.

01:19:13.295 --> 01:19:15.729
l know, l know,
but l made a mistake.

01:19:15.764 --> 01:19:17.322
Ehh, you're only human.

01:19:17.366 --> 01:19:21.359
Mitch, l-l-l'm asking, please.
Please.

01:19:23.572 --> 01:19:26.063
The hearing's in an hour.
You're kidding, right?

01:19:26.108 --> 01:19:27.598
l know.

01:19:27.643 --> 01:19:30.407
l need a little something
more to go on here.

01:19:30.446 --> 01:19:31.936
l can't go into it.

01:19:31.980 --> 01:19:36.849
l just missed something.
l made a-- l made a mistake.

01:19:36.885 --> 01:19:40.218
lf you want to plead
your concerns, it's fine,

01:19:40.255 --> 01:19:43.156
or if you want to submit
additional evidence, that's okay too.

01:19:43.192 --> 01:19:45.956
But you know as well as l do
his fate's already been determined.

01:19:45.994 --> 01:19:47.621
lt's luck and quotas.

01:19:47.663 --> 01:19:51.497
Nothing l say
will make a difference?

01:19:55.304 --> 01:19:58.364
Well, don't sweat it, Jack.

01:19:58.407 --> 01:20:00.637
l mean, you're less than a month to go.
Sleep easy.

01:20:00.676 --> 01:20:02.644
- Hmm?
- All right.

01:20:08.417 --> 01:20:11.477
- l'm going out.
- What about the Creeson hearing?

01:20:15.290 --> 01:20:17.224
Thanks, Paul.

01:20:17.259 --> 01:20:19.557
( radio talk show playing )

01:20:30.172 --> 01:20:32.640
Radio host #1 :
Revelation 3:20.

01:20:32.674 --> 01:20:36.337
''Behold l stand at the door and knock.
lf any man open the door,

01:20:36.378 --> 01:20:39.279
l will come into him
and sup with him and he with me.''

01:20:39.314 --> 01:20:41.214
Revelation 3:20.

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:43.241
Radio host #2:
All right, the next one is...

01:20:43.285 --> 01:20:47.346
( host stammering )

01:20:47.389 --> 01:20:49.254
lt says Christ died for the ungodly.

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:51.782
Radio host #1 :
Yeah, that's in Romans, chapter 5.

01:20:51.827 --> 01:20:54.591
Romans 5:8...

01:20:58.200 --> 01:21:00.225
( sighs )

01:21:00.269 --> 01:21:03.397
So we're getting
to the commandments next,

01:21:03.438 --> 01:21:05.702
l guess, huh?

01:21:17.052 --> 01:21:18.917
Do you believe in all this?

01:21:18.954 --> 01:21:20.922
What?

01:21:22.791 --> 01:21:24.554
Do you?

01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:32.463
You read the meditation.

01:21:43.979 --> 01:21:48.211
''What request is on the top
of my prayer list for today?

01:21:48.250 --> 01:21:52.346
ls it a selfish request
or one that will bring God glory?''

01:21:52.387 --> 01:21:55.356
l know what l want.
How about you?

01:21:58.894 --> 01:22:01.454
You lost your place again.

01:22:06.535 --> 01:22:09.095
You have something
you want to say to me?

01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:13.440
You don't?

01:22:13.475 --> 01:22:16.911
l can't even think
of what you'd want me to say.

01:23:06.228 --> 01:23:08.321
You want to talk about it, man?

01:23:08.363 --> 01:23:10.058
What's that?

01:23:10.098 --> 01:23:11.998
- Her comin'...
- Hmm?

01:23:12.034 --> 01:23:14.696
...or me going or anything you want.

01:23:15.904 --> 01:23:18.031
Look, l'm a little concerned
about you, man.

01:23:18.073 --> 01:23:19.870
You're seeming
a little ragged to me.

01:23:19.908 --> 01:23:23.844
Yeah well, put your mind at ease.

01:23:23.879 --> 01:23:26.109
So that's it for us, huh?

01:23:26.148 --> 01:23:29.174
You want to ask me any more questions
or go over some shit?

01:23:29.217 --> 01:23:31.685
l'll sit in the chair,
we can do that thing, you know.

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:35.383
You'd better be smart or you're
gonna be right back in here again.

01:23:35.424 --> 01:23:37.722
Hey, l got my release, Jack.

01:23:37.759 --> 01:23:41.058
You ain't got to concern yourself
about me no more, man.

01:23:41.096 --> 01:23:42.688
You got it, all right,
but make no mistake:

01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:45.291
l can have 'em watch
your goddamn ass 24 hours a day.

01:23:45.334 --> 01:23:46.801
You got me?

01:23:46.835 --> 01:23:48.325
l got you.

01:23:51.239 --> 01:23:53.707
Shit, man, you don't believe
in nothing, do you?

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:57.075
l believe you're
one fucked up son of a bitch.

01:23:57.112 --> 01:24:00.570
l know you don't believe in me,
but you don't believe in yourself.

01:24:00.615 --> 01:24:02.845
You don't believe in God.

01:24:02.884 --> 01:24:05.910
l don't think you feel that anything
is true inside of you.

01:24:05.954 --> 01:24:07.444
l'll give you true--

01:24:07.489 --> 01:24:10.083
l'm glad you're out of my hair,
Gerald Creeson.

01:24:11.393 --> 01:24:13.384
Now you can be
somebody else's headache.

01:24:13.428 --> 01:24:16.261
Oh...

01:24:16.298 --> 01:24:18.630
man, life is just
taking you by the neck,

01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:21.363
and rattling your whole frame

01:24:21.403 --> 01:24:23.701
and you don't know
which way is up.

01:24:23.739 --> 01:24:26.606
lt's scary as shit when the wheels
come off like that, man.

01:24:26.641 --> 01:24:28.336
l feel you. l've been there.

01:24:28.377 --> 01:24:32.575
l mean it. But that's when
you got to start listening, man.

01:24:32.614 --> 01:24:34.582
Where the fuck is she?

01:24:34.616 --> 01:24:36.447
You don't want to shoot the shit
with me anymore, man?

01:24:36.485 --> 01:24:37.952
l'm gonna miss shootin'
the shit with you.

01:24:37.986 --> 01:24:39.544
Not me, boy, not me.
Time for you to go.

01:24:39.588 --> 01:24:41.351
l've enjoyed choppin' it up
with you, man.

01:24:43.058 --> 01:24:45.458
Anybody here yet?

01:24:45.494 --> 01:24:47.462
Hey, just keep listenin', Jack.

01:24:47.496 --> 01:24:50.158
That's all l'm saying, 'cause l think
something's coming for you,

01:24:50.198 --> 01:24:53.690
but when it comes, man,
just stay open to it, you know.

01:24:53.735 --> 01:24:56.329
- Don't close it off.
- Here we go.

01:24:56.371 --> 01:24:57.497
ln there.

01:25:15.056 --> 01:25:17.286
Well, happy day.

01:25:23.865 --> 01:25:25.526
So, well, can l kiss her?

01:26:02.037 --> 01:26:03.527
Ready?

01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:07.435
Yeah.

01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:13.845
Well, good luck to you, Stone.

01:26:15.684 --> 01:26:18.175
Hey, l want to thank you.

01:26:18.220 --> 01:26:21.212
Seriously, l appreciate everything
that you've done for me.

01:26:21.256 --> 01:26:22.723
Yep.

01:26:26.795 --> 01:26:28.695
Good luck to you too, Mrs. Creeson.

01:26:28.730 --> 01:26:31.995
Lucetta, Jack.
l mean, we're all friends here, right?

01:26:32.033 --> 01:26:34.729
Lucetta.
Take good care of him.

01:26:34.769 --> 01:26:38.796
( whispers ) l will.
And you take good care too, old man.

01:26:40.175 --> 01:26:42.643
- See you later, Jack.
- Mmm.

01:26:47.182 --> 01:26:50.345
Oh, hey, you know, l meant to say,

01:26:50.385 --> 01:26:53.752
Lucetta, she did tell me
that you fucked her.

01:26:55.056 --> 01:26:58.150
l know that must be against
some kind of rules around here, right?

01:26:58.193 --> 01:27:00.559
l knew what you two were doing.

01:27:00.595 --> 01:27:03.894
Oh, did you know what you were doing
when you let my wife suck your cock?

01:27:04.900 --> 01:27:07.300
- Good luck to you.
- l'll see you out on the bricks.

01:27:07.335 --> 01:27:09.037
Good luck to you.

01:27:11.239 --> 01:27:13.969
Radio host #1 : Right now we enjoy
the Constitutional freedom

01:27:14.009 --> 01:27:17.001
to keep and bear arms.
lf that were ever infringed,

01:27:17.045 --> 01:27:21.607
if that were ever repealed
or just flat out violated and...

01:27:21.650 --> 01:27:25.211
Madylyn?

01:27:25.253 --> 01:27:28.552
Radio host #1 : As a Christian,
would we be within our rights,

01:27:28.590 --> 01:27:30.922
because Thomas Jefferson says

01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:34.622
these rights are inalienable
because they come from our creator...

01:27:34.663 --> 01:27:36.290
Madylyn?

01:27:36.331 --> 01:27:38.595
...within our rights as Christians

01:27:38.633 --> 01:27:41.124
to revolt against the government

01:27:41.169 --> 01:27:45.936
and its denial of those fundamental
Constitutional rights,

01:27:45.974 --> 01:27:50.172
or would a Christian
have to respond differently?

01:27:51.546 --> 01:27:53.673
- Some mail.
- Host #2: We would have to respond.

01:27:53.715 --> 01:27:56.616
And we as Christians
would have to rise up

01:27:56.651 --> 01:27:59.313
against any government that said

01:27:59.354 --> 01:28:02.482
we didn't have a right
to protect ourselves, because--

01:28:02.524 --> 01:28:04.014
l guess l would ask the question,

01:28:04.059 --> 01:28:06.755
why do they want
to take our guns away from us?

01:28:35.557 --> 01:28:37.548
( locks clicking )

01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:18.055
Lucetta's voice:
l like you.

01:29:19.601 --> 01:29:22.627
l like you, Jack.

01:29:22.671 --> 01:29:25.970
l would never fuck you
if l didn't want to.

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:29.771
( Lucetta laughs )

01:29:47.796 --> 01:29:50.196
( urinating )

01:29:55.403 --> 01:29:58.736
( thumping in distance )

01:30:40.115 --> 01:30:41.980
Madylyn!

01:30:42.016 --> 01:30:43.916
Wake up! Wake up! Madylyn!

01:30:43.952 --> 01:30:45.783
Madylyn, wake up! Wake up!

01:30:52.727 --> 01:30:54.661
Come on!

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.162
- l got to get to a phone.
- Where are you gonna go?

01:31:05.206 --> 01:31:06.673
- What about Steve and Helen?
- No, they're away.

01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:08.767
- Well, what about David?
- lt's too far. lt's too late.

01:31:08.810 --> 01:31:10.835
Ah!

01:31:10.879 --> 01:31:13.507
( Jack sobbing )
Look at this! Oh my G--

01:31:14.682 --> 01:31:17.742
Jack: Oh God.

01:31:17.786 --> 01:31:21.654
You motherfucker!

01:31:21.689 --> 01:31:24.214
God damn it. God damn it!

01:31:24.259 --> 01:31:25.692
- Don't say that.
- What?

01:31:25.727 --> 01:31:27.854
Taking the Lord's name--
stop that.

01:31:27.896 --> 01:31:31.024
- Jesus, Madylyn, please.
- Stop it! l won't stand for it!

01:31:31.065 --> 01:31:32.896
What are you talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

01:31:32.934 --> 01:31:35.494
This means something to me.
lt may not mean anything to you anymore,

01:31:35.537 --> 01:31:37.300
- but it means something to me!
- Jesus, Madylyn,

01:31:37.338 --> 01:31:39.499
we just almost
got incinerated in our sleep

01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:41.771
by some fucking nutjob
who l let out,

01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:44.301
and you're fucking bothering me
about my fucking language?

01:31:44.345 --> 01:31:46.609
- Nobody did this to us!
- Give me a fucking break!

01:31:46.648 --> 01:31:48.707
- Nobody did this to us.
- What?!

01:31:48.750 --> 01:31:50.513
lt wasn't anybody.
lt was an act of God.

01:31:50.552 --> 01:31:52.952
l've got a pretty good
fucking idea who did this to us.

01:31:52.987 --> 01:31:55.717
This was an act of God.
l'm going to tell the firemen that.

01:31:56.791 --> 01:31:59.089
What are you talking about, Madylyn?

01:31:59.127 --> 01:32:02.585
About the frayed wiring
in the kitchen wall.

01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:04.598
What are you talking about?
What wire?

01:32:04.632 --> 01:32:06.623
ln the kitchen wall.

01:32:06.668 --> 01:32:09.569
And the-- the basement.

01:32:09.604 --> 01:32:11.697
- What?
- There are all those rag--

01:32:11.739 --> 01:32:14.537
rags down there,
all those old rags.

01:32:14.576 --> 01:32:17.374
l'm gonna tell them to go down there.

01:32:20.582 --> 01:32:22.777
Why would you say that?

01:32:24.118 --> 01:32:26.916
Because it's as good
a story as any.

01:32:28.523 --> 01:32:31.686
( sirens blaring )

01:33:08.062 --> 01:33:10.656
Madylyn:
lt's not that sunny out.

01:33:10.698 --> 01:33:12.632
Candace:
Everybody knows

01:33:12.667 --> 01:33:15.636
you can still get sunburned
on a cloudy day.

01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:25.179
Madylyn:
Ah, look at the barns.

01:33:25.213 --> 01:33:26.976
Remember that?

01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:29.946
Not really.

01:33:33.187 --> 01:33:36.088
l don't know how you
stuck it out as long as you did.

01:33:38.192 --> 01:33:40.285
l think you'd have done this sooner.

01:33:43.231 --> 01:33:45.722
l almost did once.

01:33:48.036 --> 01:33:49.936
So what happened?

01:34:00.248 --> 01:34:02.682
What happened?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.582
Man:
He's free! Yeah! He's free!

01:34:11.793 --> 01:34:14.626
( laughs )
That's a free man there, huh?

01:34:29.844 --> 01:34:32.278
( soft conversation )

01:34:34.282 --> 01:34:38.275
( slurring ) You do not want to make it
a two-way conversation with them,

01:34:38.319 --> 01:34:42.483
because they have
nothing on their minds but--

01:34:42.523 --> 01:34:44.514
well, they may have
nothin' but time

01:34:44.559 --> 01:34:47.084
to just think about ways
to work on you

01:34:47.128 --> 01:34:49.096
and to get under your skin.

01:34:49.130 --> 01:34:51.360
You cannot make yourself
a person to them.

01:34:51.399 --> 01:34:53.560
Oh, believe me,
l've learned that lesson.

01:34:57.038 --> 01:34:59.370
Well, l mean,
they'll test you for sure.

01:35:01.209 --> 01:35:04.144
A good lookin' woman like you...

01:35:04.178 --> 01:35:06.203
Oh, Jack.

01:35:06.247 --> 01:35:08.374
Well, l'm--

01:35:08.416 --> 01:35:11.408
l'm retired,
l'm not dead, you know.

01:35:11.452 --> 01:35:14.421
Come on, Jack, we're friends, okay?
You're the best.

01:35:14.455 --> 01:35:16.548
l wanna have a little fun.

01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:19.321
Send me off into the sunset.

01:35:22.430 --> 01:35:24.261
Huh-uh.

01:35:24.298 --> 01:35:26.528
Let's just keep it pro, okay?

01:35:28.503 --> 01:35:30.334
You want to be a pro?

01:35:30.371 --> 01:35:33.829
Fuck pro. They're gonna fucking
chew your ass up in there.

01:35:33.875 --> 01:35:36.002
- Okay, Jack, that's enough.
- No no, it's bullshit.

01:35:36.044 --> 01:35:38.410
Jerking my chain like that,
you fucking cunt.

01:35:38.446 --> 01:35:41.643
- Gimme some respect.
- Hey, buddy, let's throw some darts.

01:35:41.682 --> 01:35:43.479
Yeah yeah, l'm in.

01:35:43.518 --> 01:35:46.453
- Up yours.
- Whoa whoa whoa, buddy, hey.

01:35:46.487 --> 01:35:49.854
Jack:
l'm just fucked up. l should go.

01:35:49.891 --> 01:35:53.088
- No, ride with me.
- No, l'm-l'm gonna get a cab.

01:35:53.127 --> 01:35:54.992
l'm good, l'm good.
l'm gonna get a cab.

01:35:55.029 --> 01:35:58.965
l'm good, word of honor.
l'm good. lt's a cab.

01:36:00.968 --> 01:36:03.493
Radio: ...get us to the reality
that God has already deemed

01:36:03.538 --> 01:36:06.735
is going to happen,
and nothing is going to change that.

01:36:06.774 --> 01:36:09.800
And so it's not like
there is this cosmic battle

01:36:09.844 --> 01:36:12.074
between good and evil,

01:36:12.113 --> 01:36:14.581
and good might not triumph.

01:36:14.615 --> 01:36:17.277
The reality is that
there is a battle going on

01:36:17.318 --> 01:36:20.981
where you would see
a huge boxer

01:36:21.022 --> 01:36:22.819
holding a guy's head back,

01:36:22.857 --> 01:36:26.122
and the little scrawny guy
is flailing his arms,

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.685
waving at the guy,
trying to beat him.

01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:32.187
That's exactly what God--
God has Satan subdued,

01:36:32.233 --> 01:36:34.258
but in the flailing of his arms--

01:36:34.302 --> 01:36:37.533
and this is particularly brought out
in Revelation, chapter 1 2--

01:36:37.572 --> 01:36:42.202
Satan flailing his arms
is able to do an awful lot of chaos

01:36:42.243 --> 01:36:44.939
and damage and bad things happen.

01:36:44.979 --> 01:36:47.345
And it's because he is enraged

01:36:47.381 --> 01:36:49.372
because he knows his time is short.

01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:50.941
Revelation 1 2 said that.

01:36:50.985 --> 01:36:52.919
Jack: Hey!

01:37:05.466 --> 01:37:07.491
Stone:
This is some shit, man.

01:37:07.535 --> 01:37:08.866
Wait whoa!

01:37:10.371 --> 01:37:12.396
You ruined my whole life. Why?

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.568
Fucking why? Why?

01:37:15.610 --> 01:37:17.544
Why what?

01:37:17.578 --> 01:37:19.375
Why did you do it?

01:37:20.848 --> 01:37:22.713
Why did you...

01:37:28.756 --> 01:37:31.247
Okay okay okay okay.

01:37:32.627 --> 01:37:34.720
Hey, man,

01:37:34.762 --> 01:37:36.354
you ain't gonna do this.

01:37:41.035 --> 01:37:42.764
You think l won't?

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.501
You think l won't?
( chuckles )

01:37:48.976 --> 01:37:50.841
You think l won't?

01:37:50.878 --> 01:37:52.937
You think l won't?!

01:38:05.993 --> 01:38:08.052
No.

01:38:10.064 --> 01:38:11.929
No, l don't.

01:38:39.227 --> 01:38:41.752
Woman on radio:
Yeah, at first, l thought l was crazy.

01:38:41.796 --> 01:38:43.957
Was this really happening to me?

01:38:43.998 --> 01:38:46.933
Was it all in my head,
or is there really a God

01:38:46.968 --> 01:38:49.402
who can breathe life into me

01:38:49.437 --> 01:38:51.837
and make me feel his presence?

01:38:51.872 --> 01:38:55.603
So this is actually what
encouraged me to write the book.

01:38:55.643 --> 01:38:59.340
And honestly it completely changed
the way that l look at life...

01:38:59.380 --> 01:39:02.110
Man on radio:
Assume that there was a Higher Power,

01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:03.878
that lt created the universe,

01:39:03.918 --> 01:39:07.149
until God set a bush on fire...

01:39:07.188 --> 01:39:08.985
Man in room:
And maybe l did.

01:39:09.023 --> 01:39:11.253
Man on radio: ...and said,
''Oh, by the way, you were right.''

01:39:11.292 --> 01:39:14.728
( overlapping radio and dialogue )

01:39:15.997 --> 01:39:18.329
( laughs )

01:39:23.671 --> 01:39:26.299
You know, and...

01:39:26.340 --> 01:39:28.331
l think-- l think l'm ready to get out.

01:39:28.376 --> 01:39:31.072
Male radio host: Next up here is
Gerald from southwest Detroit.

01:39:31.112 --> 01:39:33.512
- Welcome, Gerald.
- Stone: l just want to say,

01:39:33.547 --> 01:39:36.175
l got this book and they say that

01:39:36.217 --> 01:39:39.084
when you experience a spiritual truth,

01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:41.213
that it comes to you through sound.

01:39:41.255 --> 01:39:44.554
lf you let this sound go through you,

01:39:44.592 --> 01:39:47.823
it changes you, you know?

01:39:47.862 --> 01:39:50.660
lt puts you back into harmony,

01:39:50.698 --> 01:39:54.600
you know, makes you
like a tuning fork of God.

01:39:54.635 --> 01:39:56.159
Host: Okay.

01:39:56.203 --> 01:39:59.263
Stone: Yeah, they say--
they say it can start with small things

01:39:59.307 --> 01:40:02.765
like little vibrations--
you know, the sound of a bee,

01:40:02.810 --> 01:40:05.506
the sound of a buzzing light--
and then it grows.

01:40:05.546 --> 01:40:07.912
Host:
All right, that's interesting.

01:40:07.948 --> 01:40:10.178
Stone: Well, they say

01:40:10.217 --> 01:40:12.742
that everything that happens to you

01:40:12.787 --> 01:40:16.518
is what was supposed
to happen to you for you to advance,

01:40:16.557 --> 01:40:19.219
that you've got to
come back lots of times,

01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:22.423
you know, cycle through many lives
until you learn, until you...

01:40:23.798 --> 01:40:25.925
Male radio host:
Well, thanks for your input.

01:40:25.966 --> 01:40:29.367
Next up here
on the WDDL listener line is

01:40:29.403 --> 01:40:32.861
Kathy in Farmington Hills.
You're on All Voices Under God.

01:40:32.907 --> 01:40:35.637
( radio broadcast fades out )

01:40:48.656 --> 01:40:51.489
( bee buzzing )

01:41:03.437 --> 01:41:05.837
( bee buzzing )

01:41:08.976 --> 01:41:10.807
( buzzing fades )

01:41:10.845 --> 01:41:13.109
( silence )

01:41:18.085 --> 01:41:21.543
( instrumental music playing )
