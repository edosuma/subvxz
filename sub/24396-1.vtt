00:42.751 --> 00:45.336
<i>Welcome to </i>Letting Go With Love.

00:47.630 --> 00:48.715
<i>Chapter one.</i>

00:53.470 --> 00:54.679
<i>You're on a dock.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.101
<i>You've been here before.</i>

01:08.318 --> 01:10.320
<i>Choose to walk down the dock.</i>

01:22.707 --> 01:23.875
<i>Notice the boat.</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:31.090
<i>Notice the gathering clouds...</i>

01:33.134 --> 01:34.344
<i>the high winds...</i>

01:36.471 --> 01:37.972
<i>the unsteady seas.</i>

01:42.101 --> 01:44.229
<i>Choose to board the boat.</i>

01:53.196 --> 01:54.364
<i>Now hold on...</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:57.617
<i>and never let go.</i>

02:08.002 --> 02:09.420
<i>Happy 4th July.</i>

02:09.504 --> 02:12.507
<i>If you're looking for that perfect burst</i>
<i>of fireworks in the sky,</i>

02:12.590 --> 02:15.218
<i>Colleen Malone has already done</i>
<i>the groundwork for you.</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:16.678
<i>Colleen and her team of experts</i>

02:16.761 --> 02:19.347
<i>have designed the show</i>
<i>over LA's Dodger Stadium,</i>

02:19.430 --> 02:21.057
<i>and she's here to talk to us now.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.852
<i>-So, Colleen, thanks for joining us.</i>
<i>Happy to be here.</i>

02:24.352 --> 02:27.272
<i>Hey, you have reached Seth and...</i>

02:27.355 --> 02:29.023
<i>And me, too!</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:32.527
<i>Should they leave a message?</i>
<i>Leave a message, please.</i>

02:32.610 --> 02:33.653
<i>Did I do good?</i>

02:35.280 --> 02:38.950
<i>The mailbox is full and cannot</i>
<i>accept any messages at this time. Goodbye.</i>

02:39.033 --> 02:40.827
Hey! Open up.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.288
-Yeah, OK. Just hold on one second.

02:43.371 --> 02:46.416
-Just don't touch the thing.
I can't open it.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.209
What? Oh, there you go.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.836
-OK, we got it.
-Whoo!

02:51.713 --> 02:54.299
-Just hold on one second. I got it.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.383
All right.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.260
-Hi.
-Hi. I thought you forgot about me.

02:57.343 --> 03:00.471
-I'm 15 minutes early.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.639
-Yeah.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.893
I sent Ella the cutest little truck
and he hasn't called me to thank me.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.104
Oh.

03:11.941 --> 03:14.360
-We're not going to CVS.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.820
Oh, come on. Please?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.406
They're having this big make-up special.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.742
You know, eyeliners and lip liners

03:20.825 --> 03:22.076
and eyebrow liners.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.747
Anything that has a "luh" sound in it
is on sale, two for five.

03:26.414 --> 03:28.583
You don't need...
You have so much make-up.

03:28.666 --> 03:31.544
-Maybe on the way back.
-You just want to wander the aisles.

03:31.628 --> 03:34.088
You don't get anything.
It should be quality over quantity.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.883
Are you going to put
some earrings on later tonight?

03:36.966 --> 03:39.177
Yeah, I have these on. I'm going to...

03:39.260 --> 03:40.887
But you have a different...

03:40.970 --> 03:43.097
For the party tonight,
are you putting on earrings?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.307
Maybe a little lipstick?

03:44.390 --> 03:46.100
-Yeah.
-Maybe we can get you a nice liner.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.311
I'm going to...
I'll put all the make-up on.

03:48.394 --> 03:50.480
Oh, good.
-I mean, I'm...

03:50.563 --> 03:52.857
-It's a party.
-No, I know.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.275
I know what... I know what...

03:58.363 --> 03:59.739
OK, fire her up.

04:11.167 --> 04:12.669
Coming through, hot soup.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.962
Oh, excuse me.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.089
Sorry.

04:17.840 --> 04:19.550
-Whoa!

04:19.634 --> 04:21.886
-It's definitely a dog toy.
-It's not a dog toy.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.722
Um... There's a spot
to blow all these up in the back, right?

04:24.806 --> 04:25.807
OK, great.

04:27.392 --> 04:30.520
OK. Yeah, we need all this stuff.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.481
Oh, how cute. That's so big.
Don't you think that's good value?

04:36.693 --> 04:38.695
OK, don't. Don't, don't, don't.

04:40.488 --> 04:43.116
-I don't think they're going to fit.
-Oh, they will fit.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.618
Oh, my gosh!

04:45.702 --> 04:47.120
Come on, you guys.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.122
You little bastards. Get in there.

04:51.833 --> 04:55.378
Let's pull them through.
Seriously, I've got to pee.

04:55.461 --> 04:56.796
OK. All right.

04:56.879 --> 04:57.880
OK. Ah!

05:02.927 --> 05:04.762
Oh, that looks good. OK.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.227
Mom! Mom?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.149
Mom?

05:17.942 --> 05:20.320
That's great. Can you fill
half of these with juice boxes?

05:20.403 --> 05:21.612
-My niece is coming.
-Sure.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.740
-Cups!
-Killing it.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.575
Hey, hey, hey.
I owe you. I swear this time.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.161
You know, there's an outlet over there.
Thanks so much.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.790
What's going on here?
There's a drought in California.

05:32.874 --> 05:35.209
-I was just going to turn it off.
-OK.

05:35.293 --> 05:37.462
Are these pig blankets
tight enough for you?

05:37.545 --> 05:38.546
Yeah.

05:39.130 --> 05:40.548
-Yeah.
-You're going to re-roll.

05:40.631 --> 05:43.468
-She's going to re-roll those.
-You guys are so mean. I...

05:45.762 --> 05:47.096
I might... I might re-roll them.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.473
Hey, Mom?

05:49.265 --> 05:50.349
Mom!  What is...

05:55.104 --> 05:56.814
-I'm thinking this.
-Yeah.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.399
-No.

05:59.567 --> 06:02.278
Well, you don't need to...
It's a good outfit, but no.

06:02.361 --> 06:04.030
Oh, hold on. Your tag is out.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.156
-Thank you.
-OK.

06:05.615 --> 06:07.909
Oh, my God. He will see the balloons
from down the block.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.786
Wait. What are you wearing, if not this?

06:09.869 --> 06:12.413
-I have a thing laid out. Another outfit.

06:12.497 --> 06:15.458
I have a... It's cute. I think
it's pretty cute. It's like a dress.

06:15.541 --> 06:16.626
It's like a dress?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.044
-It <i>is</i> a--
-Hold on.

06:18.127 --> 06:20.505
I think maybe people
might come into your room.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.215
You can fold a couple of things.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.591
Is this a shirt or a dress?

06:25.218 --> 06:27.095
I think if you
have to question what it is...

06:27.178 --> 06:30.014
Don't think.
One, two, three. Shirt or dress?

06:30.598 --> 06:32.642
I mean, I think it could be
either of those things.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.686
If you have to ask yourself, maybe
it's not the best choice. I don't know.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.146
I need to ask myself.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.273
-I just... I can't...
-This is stressing you out.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.316
Hello!
-Hey!

06:40.399 --> 06:41.400
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.277
You can see the balloons down the block.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.197
I know. Will you say something to Mom?
I just can't with her right now.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.157
Yeah, sure. Yeah. Is Seth here?

06:48.241 --> 06:50.034
-Wait. You were supposed to get him.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.869
-Definitely, you were.
-Hey, Cam.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.329
-Hi, Gar.
-Hey.

06:53.412 --> 06:54.956
Let's get this party started.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.124
Yes.

06:56.207 --> 06:57.208
Here we go.

06:57.291 --> 06:58.417
Looks good.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.045
Just peeling eggs.
It's actually exhausting.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.047
-Hell, yeah. Thank you.
Sure.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.676
I will go deal with your mother.
Thank you.

07:09.387 --> 07:10.972
Your dad is so hot.

07:11.055 --> 07:12.056
OK.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.182
It's true.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.060
Did that, like,
make you uncomfortable growing up?

07:16.144 --> 07:17.145
It was really hard.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.063
It was a dress for a child.
I looked it up.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.315
Hm. What the fuck is that?

07:21.399 --> 07:22.859
Um... What the fuck is this?

07:22.942 --> 07:24.694
-Yeah.
-It's a sign I handcrafted.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.611
No.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.946
-Respect it.
-No.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.032
-Yeah, this is glue stick. Yeah.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.661
-You can pay people to do that for you.
-You can.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.205
-You can if you're a sucker.
-For sure, yeah.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.415
I don't know.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.542
Oh, my gosh.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.669
OK. You guys, Jack made it to drinks.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.213
-Good
-Yes.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.673
You guys don't think he knows?

07:45.756 --> 07:47.049
-Yeah.
-No.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.427
Yeah, I know that he doesn't know.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.095
-Right, he better not know.
-Uh-uh.

07:52.763 --> 07:56.350
I am dying to see
his cute fucking face when...

07:57.351 --> 08:00.104
I can't even. I mean, I can't <i>even.</i>
In my heart, I can't.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.481
Fucking face.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.691
The fireworks. It's going to be...

08:03.774 --> 08:05.526
-It's almost too much.
-It is.

08:05.610 --> 08:06.736
It is almost too much.

08:06.819 --> 08:08.946
OK. All right. OK.
I'm going to go get the cake.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.990
-I can do that.
-No, I'm going to get the cake.

08:11.073 --> 08:12.408
Then I'm going to get the tacos

08:12.492 --> 08:14.702
before my mom starts telling me
everyone will starve.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.786
-OK.
-OK.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.206
Please stop eating everything.

08:18.289 --> 08:19.624
This is a tiered thing.

08:19.707 --> 08:23.044
-I worked hard on making these color--
-You're losing your mind. Go.

08:23.127 --> 08:26.130
-Remove yourself from the premises.
-We love you. Go!

08:26.214 --> 08:28.883
-Call me if you need anything.
-Have fun. We are covered.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.010
-She's freaking out.
-You're stressing her out.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.261
I ate <i>one</i> of these.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.973
-Can you peel or--

08:36.057 --> 08:37.683
-Put that away.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.668
<i>Chapter two.</i>

09:06.546 --> 09:08.172
<i>You are on the same boat.</i>

09:10.925 --> 09:13.219
<i>Notice how water has rotted the boat.</i>

09:15.012 --> 09:18.641
<i>Promise yourself to fix it</i>
<i>before you travel.</i>

09:27.942 --> 09:29.902
-Lost one.
Yeah, it was my fault.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.572
My fault. My fault. I got excited.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.781
OK.

09:33.864 --> 09:34.991
It's OK.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.077
Katie, I hope you have
more food than this.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.745
Your friends are going to starve.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.455
Yeah, Ma, I'm going.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.499
And get your brother
for me on the way.

10:22.204 --> 10:23.414
Ding-dong!

10:24.582 --> 10:25.833
I'll be right there.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.837
All right. Got your backpack

10:29.920 --> 10:31.130
Have you got your shoes?

10:40.389 --> 10:41.390
My balloons.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.978
I forgot my red balloon and my blue one.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.481
I have two balloons.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.816
Two red ones...

10:50.900 --> 10:53.277
-...and two blue.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.113
Can you go get them?
Are you OK?

10:56.906 --> 10:57.907
Yeah.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.539
Keep that there, and give you this guy.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.418
Oh, yeah.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.003
Kitty cat.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.882
This fucking thing just, like...

11:16.050 --> 11:17.802
It's... It's a normal seat belt.

11:17.885 --> 11:20.554
-Just click it in.
-Maybe you could come back and help me.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.139
I don't know why you're in the front.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.224
-Sorry.
Meow!

11:26.811 --> 11:28.104
I just can't get this. I need more slack.

11:30.564 --> 11:33.567
Meow! Meow! Meow! Meow!

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
Meow!

11:35.194 --> 11:37.571
How do stupid people do this? I'm just...

11:37.655 --> 11:38.781
Meow! Meow!

11:38.864 --> 11:40.533
Hi. Yeah.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.993
Can you say "Aunt Katie is  incompetent"?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.871
Incompetent.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.623
Yeah, that's my girl.

11:47.706 --> 11:49.125
-That's not good.
-Incompetent.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.794
Exactly.
-No, that's not a good thing to teach her.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.463
Incompetent.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.551
<i>How old is Jack?</i>

11:58.634 --> 12:00.136
He's thirty...

12:00.219 --> 12:01.929
-Thirty-six.
-...six.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.305
He is a grown man.

12:03.389 --> 12:06.600
Yeah, you're throwing a 36-year-old
grown man a surprise party. That's...

12:06.684 --> 12:07.977
It's supposed to be funny.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.770
-Yeah.
-And it's going to be. It's... Yeah, it's going to be hilarious.

12:11.647 --> 12:14.483
Great idea, and it's going to be executed.

12:18.779 --> 12:20.239
What's uh... What's this?

12:20.322 --> 12:22.074
Oh, Jack needs paper towels.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.328
Man, Jack is such a... B-minus.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.247
He's a B

12:28.330 --> 12:30.458
Then you're definitely a D.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.127
I would rather be a D
than a fucking B-minus.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.129
OK, I'm going to just ignore you now.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.950
Dinner to go. Your order's ready.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.916
-Oh, that's perfect. Great.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.042
Do you need help?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.212
No, I've... I've got this.

13:17.129 --> 13:18.214
-Thank you.
-Mm-hm.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.466
All right.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.592
Come here. Come here.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.844
Why don't you hold on to me?

13:23.928 --> 13:26.514
Hold on to me. We're going to go.
Yeah, that's perfect.

13:26.597 --> 13:28.474
OK, here we go.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.310
You've got my butt?

13:32.269 --> 13:33.562
You've got my butt?

13:40.486 --> 13:41.695
Kitty cat.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.615
Meow! Meow!

13:49.787 --> 13:50.788
Um...

13:51.956 --> 13:55.000
Mom sent Ella a truck, and I guess
you didn't call her to thank her for it.

13:55.709 --> 13:58.087
-OK.
-Well, it's because you didn't get it.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.255
You didn't open it.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.173
OK.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.678
Well, you stopped opening
your mail last time, too.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.847
What

14:12.893 --> 14:15.354
Can you just... roll up your sleeve?

14:18.524 --> 14:20.526
Just show me your arm.

14:22.403 --> 14:23.779
-No.
-Just show me your arm.

14:23.863 --> 14:24.864
Can we not do this?

14:24.947 --> 14:26.907
-Seth, just show me.
-There's nothing to see.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.993
Then we'll just go to my house,
go to the party.

14:29.076 --> 14:31.871
-This fucking hurts my feelings.
-Just show me and we go to my house.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.955
Can you trust me?

15:14.413 --> 15:15.956
How did this happen again?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.419
It's hard.  It's OK.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.216
It's OK.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.431
I've got to take you to detox.

15:34.892 --> 15:35.976
Yeah, I know.

-I think we should take her to my house.

-I just... I can't.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.765
I mean, why?

16:56.849 --> 16:59.309
Why?
Because people don't do that, all right?

16:59.393 --> 17:00.728
I'll get fired.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.064
I'll do... I'll do a four-day detox.
That's it, though.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.859
Just tell them Dad's sick or something.
No one will question that.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.403
Yes, of course they will.
Katie, it's not that easy.

17:09.486 --> 17:12.114
Just listen to me, please.
Dad got me the job, all right?

17:12.197 --> 17:14.950

so we're not doing that, OK?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.150
Everyone's going to know.

17:58.452 --> 17:59.745
I just wish you had told me.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.498
Next time.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.462
-That was a joke.
-No, it was... That was hilarious.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.923
-I was, like, on the floor.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.426
-You don't seem like you're on the floor.
-I mean, if I wasn't driving...

18:14.510 --> 18:15.552
Yeah?

18:15.636 --> 18:18.347
...I would be just, like, done.

18:18.430 --> 18:21.433
-That's very sweet of you to say.
-Yeah, it brought down the house.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.977
You should develop that into,
like, a longer act.

18:24.478 --> 18:26.146
With your encouragement, I might.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.023
This actually is a pretty long act.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.691
You've got at least...

18:30.567 --> 18:33.570
what is it, a couple of years' worth
of material here, right?

18:34.446 --> 18:36.323
You're making me feel so warm right now.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.117
Yeah, that's my job.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.202
Hey, girlie.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.204
-Come here. Let me unbuckle you.
-Kitty cat.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.665
All right, let's go.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.416
Have you got your bunny?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.669
All right, out.

18:49.169 --> 18:52.172
Out, out, out. OK. Shut the door.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.007
OK.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.135
Just be careful
before the car comes.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.595
OK, yeah.
Before the car comes, huh?

18:58.679 --> 18:59.847
Just be careful.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.642
Still looks like a crack house.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
Well, you'll fit right in, right?

19:08.188 --> 19:09.189
Funny.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.496
Wait, wait, wait. She needs shoes.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.373
She's fine.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.042
Just... Just give me the keys.
It will take two seconds.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.252
I'll hold her.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.713
Come on. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm just going to the car.

19:32.796 --> 19:36.842
-I'll hold her. You don't need to go.
-Katie, it's... OK. All right, calm down.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.553
Don't tell me to calm down.
That's the worst thing you could say.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.054
Don't make a thing of this, please.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.598
I just think it's insane

19:42.681 --> 19:46.268
that you picked this moment,
of all moments, to be a parent.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.519
And it's actually...

19:48.145 --> 19:50.063
It's <i>actually</i> insane.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.066
I don't understand why you get so pissed
about the dumbest shit.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.860
-Nothing.

19:55.527 --> 19:56.945
Hello.
-Hi.

19:57.446 --> 19:59.907
Hi. Um... Your insurance card?

20:00.616 --> 20:01.950
Can I help you?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.660
Yeah. Um... Can we come inside?

20:03.744 --> 20:05.120
I need some information first.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.039
Me.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.584
-Um... You bet he has.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.920
And what are you detoxing from?

20:17.799 --> 20:20.636
-I knew I should have dropped her off.
-It's fine. Just give her to me.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.471
-OK.
-Come here, baby. Come here.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.181
OK. Um...

20:25.140 --> 20:27.267
-Well--
-We'll be... We'll be right here.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.352
OK.

20:54.628 --> 20:55.921
Ma'am?
-Yeah.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.966
Um... He's on heroin.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.135
-Um... Anthem.

21:02.719 --> 21:05.097
Unfortunately, we don't take Anthem.

21:05.180 --> 21:06.765
But he's been here before.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.226
Does he have a new job
since the last time?

21:10.727 --> 21:12.020
Yeah.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.232
Then we probably took
his last job's insurance.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.151
OK, but you can still admit him, right?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.362
We have an outpatient program.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.992
No, he needs to be in
for ten days for it to work.

21:25.075 --> 21:25.909
OK.

21:25.993 --> 21:28.578
Not that it's never worked, but um...

21:29.162 --> 21:30.914
I can admit him if you want to pay cash.

21:32.165 --> 21:35.043
-It's $5,000 for the ten-day program.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.380
OK, just give me a minute.

21:43.093 --> 21:45.304
Credit card.
They don't take your insurance.

21:45.387 --> 21:47.055
But my credit's fucked. You know that.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.183
Seth, tell me
what to do right now.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.105
Can you pay for it?

21:58.734 --> 22:00.485
You still owe me five grand
from last time.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.904
How long have you waited
to play that card?

22:02.988 --> 22:05.615
-That's what I'm doing.
-I bet you think about that all the time.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.076
-Every once in a while--
-All you fucking people, man.

22:08.160 --> 22:11.288
You, Mom, Dad. It's like--

22:11.371 --> 22:14.041
-Yeah, that's so lovely.
-There are always strings attached.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.417
!
-Gross.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.627
The string attached
is that you stay fucking clean,

22:17.711 --> 22:19.212
not that you achieve greatness.

22:19.296 --> 22:20.672
OK, OK.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.050
The bar is so low that there's not a bar.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.843
It's just, like, the ground, so...

22:30.932 --> 22:32.142
Why don't you ask Jack?

22:34.811 --> 22:37.022
You want me to ask my boyfriend
to pay for your detox?

22:37.105 --> 22:38.315
I don't know.

22:40.442 --> 22:41.860
Who are you?

22:41.943 --> 22:43.070
I'm a piece of shit.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.447
Ma'am? Yeah.

22:47.824 --> 22:48.992
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

22:49.076 --> 22:50.619
Hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop, stop!

22:51.495 --> 22:53.497
We need to go get the cat.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.709
No, no, no!

22:57.793 --> 22:59.586
Told you she needed fucking shoes.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.421
-Yeah.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.257
American Group takes Anthem.
They're downtown.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.593
Um... OK.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.932
I don't think I can go downtown right now.

23:12.015 --> 23:14.601
I'm throwing my boyfriend
a surprise birthday party tonight.

23:16.311 --> 23:19.564
And I'm... I-I just want you to know,
I did hear myself say that out loud.

23:20.273 --> 23:21.274
So...

23:22.901 --> 23:25.946
Did you want me to call American,
let them know you're coming?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.782
-Mm-hm.

23:28.865 --> 23:32.410
OK, so you're just going to take him to
one location. That's it, OK? Don't stop.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.913
I just...
I can't stress how important that is, OK?

23:34.996 --> 23:37.165
I'm sorry.
She talks like that to everyone. I'm really sorry
I'm not taking you myself.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.842
-I know you don't care, but this party--
-No, I really don't.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.596
OK.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.265
-Goodbye.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.516
OK, go and say goodbye.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.644
Hey. Hey, monkey.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.271
Hey.

23:59.354 --> 24:02.858
Daddy's just feeling a little sick,
but I'm going to go get better, OK?

24:03.775 --> 24:04.776
Hey.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.987
I love you more than the whole wide world.

24:07.529 --> 24:09.531
Can I get a kiss

24:10.240 --> 24:11.283
Thanks, sweetheart.

24:12.409 --> 24:13.451
Can I give you kisses?

24:16.454 --> 24:17.455
OK.

24:24.212 --> 24:25.213
So...

24:27.841 --> 24:29.759
All right, can we... Let's go. Can we go?

24:32.512 --> 24:33.847
Hi.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.223
What the fuck took so long?

24:35.307 --> 24:36.391
Where's the cake?

24:36.474 --> 24:39.603
OK, still have to get the cake.
Can you watch Ella? She's in the car.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.856
Your phone is ringing.
-You're not meant to leave babies in cars.

24:42.939 --> 24:44.858
She's sleeping, it's fine. I got it.

24:44.941 --> 24:47.194
All right. Where's Seth?
-He stayed home.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.112
-Your phone is still ringing.
-I've got it.

24:49.196 --> 24:51.156
-I'll just take it.
-I have it. I've got it.

24:51.239 --> 24:52.240
OK. All right.

25:27.150 --> 25:28.735
<i>Chapter three.</i>

25:31.988 --> 25:33.156
<i>You're here again.</i>

25:38.370 --> 25:39.955
<i>You board the same boat.</i>

25:44.584 --> 25:47.963
<i>Admit to yourself that you do not know</i>
<i>how to drive this boat.</i>

25:59.391 --> 26:03.103
<i>Tell yourself you are the only person</i>
<i>who can drive this boat.</i>

26:07.440 --> 26:09.985
<i>Now push off... and paddle.</i>

26:13.905 --> 26:14.739
Oh!

26:15.365 --> 26:16.491
You look good.

26:16.574 --> 26:17.575
Thank you. Better.

26:20.328 --> 26:21.496
OK.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.123
That was so close.

26:23.873 --> 26:25.083
So close.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.088
She's asleep.

26:30.171 --> 26:31.923
She's napping.

26:32.007 --> 26:35.468
Um... He went home. Yeah. He had to...
Can you just give me one second, please?

26:35.552 --> 26:38.096
-Yeah, I'm going to grab it now.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.556
-So just take her with you.
-OK.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.392
-She's passed out.

26:43.226 --> 26:46.146
Yeah, it's fine.
Yeah, let's just get a drink.

26:46.229 --> 26:47.522
It's fine.

26:47.605 --> 26:49.399
Everything's OK, though, right?

26:50.275 --> 26:52.444
Yeah.

26:54.738 --> 26:57.824
<i>You are on the fastest route</i>

27:01.411 --> 27:04.581
<i>In 100 feet,</i>

27:16.217 --> 27:18.428
<i>You are on the same boat.</i>

27:20.513 --> 27:21.598
<i>Keep right.</i>

27:22.891 --> 27:24.559
<i>Notice the engine.</i>

27:26.436 --> 27:27.437
<i>Try the wheel.</i>

27:46.456 --> 27:47.916
<i>You cannot drive...</i>

27:54.756 --> 27:56.424
<i>and you cannot paddle...</i>

28:01.679 --> 28:03.390
<i>and think that you...</i>

28:03.473 --> 28:05.392
<i>might... drown.</i>

28:05.475 --> 28:07.811
No, he <i>was</i> on Oxy.
Now it's just heroin.  I understand.
-Don't say that you understand.

28:10.313 --> 28:12.148
It's, like, the worst thing
that you can say.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.151
-I understand that you're angry.
-Oh, my God. I'm going to lose my mind.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.612
-I understand.
-You say that, and you keep saying it!

28:17.695 --> 28:20.407
-I understand.
Where's the bathroom?

28:20.490 --> 28:21.991
There's a bed in Pasadena. Hey, sir!

28:24.786 --> 28:27.372
Come here, come here, come here. Hey. OK.

28:41.594 --> 28:42.804
Daddy.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.266
Take her away.
Get away. Get away.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.186
It's OK, baby. It's all right.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.480
Ella. Ella, it's OK.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.858
<i>Starting route</i>

<i>In 0.2 miles,</i>

29:00.363 --> 29:04.200
-It's OK. Ella, it's OK. Look at me.
-Come on, man. You've got to let me out.

29:04.284 --> 29:06.161
Just... Just fucking let me out.

29:09.372 --> 29:10.582
Shut the lights!

29:11.916 --> 29:13.209
But she's not answering.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.503
Yeah. Well, I'm sure she'll be fine.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.133
OK. Where are you?

29:20.633 --> 29:22.093
It hurts so fucking...

29:22.969 --> 29:24.304
It fucking hurts.

29:24.387 --> 29:27.557
Ella, baby, can you sing me a song?
Can you sing "Wheels on the Bus"?

29:27.640 --> 29:29.309
Just... Just take me to get some.

29:29.392 --> 29:31.603

I'll go anywhere you want. Please.

29:31.686 --> 29:33.521
-Daddy!
-Please. Just take me. I'll go.

29:39.152 --> 29:40.695
That's too far. It's too far.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.156
All I do is lie for you.

29:43.239 --> 29:47.076
I'll be... I'll be fine. I just need
a little bit. Just take me there.

29:47.160 --> 29:48.161
I can't. I can't.

29:49.329 --> 29:51.623
I'm sorry.
I don't want to fucking do this to you.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.625
I don't want to do this to you,
but I have to...

29:58.338 --> 30:00.423
I'll be... It will be fine.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.008
I'll be fine. I just need a...

OK, they're here. They're here.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.436
Down, down. Shh.

30:16.314 --> 30:19.108
Surprise!

30:26.241 --> 30:27.617
What is going on?

30:30.119 --> 30:31.788
Yes!

30:33.039 --> 30:34.499
Oh, my God. Wait, wait.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.293
Where are you

30:37.377 --> 30:39.921
She's um... There was...
There was a cake thing.

30:40.004 --> 30:42.131
A problem with the cake,
but she's coming.

30:42.215 --> 30:45.343
-No, literally, she is getting a cake.

30:45.426 --> 30:48.555
I cannot believe she would do this.
I have never been surprised before.

30:48.638 --> 30:50.265
-I know!

30:50.348 --> 30:51.683
We gave you your first surprise?

30:51.766 --> 30:53.351
-Oh, my gosh.
-We did, yeah.

30:53.434 --> 30:54.435
She is...

30:57.939 --> 31:00.233
She's going to be so pissed
is what she's going to be.

31:01.401 --> 31:02.902
I just need a little bit.

31:07.532 --> 31:08.908
Katie, please.

31:20.461 --> 31:23.131
I won't do it again.
I won't do it. This is the last time.

31:23.923 --> 31:26.885
This is the last time.
I fucking swear this is the last time.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.012
Just a little bit.
I just need a little bit.

32:08.217 --> 32:09.218
It's OK. It's OK.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.952
<i>Surprise!</i>

32:43.586 --> 32:44.671
<i>What is going on?</i>

32:47.173 --> 32:48.883
<i>Is this my party?</i>
<i>Yes!</i>

32:50.051 --> 32:51.344
<i>Oh, my God. Wait, wait.</i>

<i>Where is she</i>

33:03.314 --> 33:04.440
Tell me where to go.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.364
Get some at 7th and San Pedro.

33:12.240 --> 33:13.533
Seventh and San Pedro.

34:17.597 --> 34:19.849
Can we turn around?

34:22.769 --> 34:24.145
OK. All right, slow down.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.983
What are you doing, man?
Fucking slow...

34:29.067 --> 34:30.610
No. I'm going.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.320
You're staying in the fucking car.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.531
You're fucking crazy. No.
-You won't come back.

34:35.615 --> 34:37.450
No, you're not fucking going.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.869
<i>If I leave you</i>
<i>in the car with her, you'll stay.</i>

34:43.664 --> 34:44.665
Right?

34:57.178 --> 34:58.638
Six black.

34:59.639 --> 35:00.723
<i>That's what I say?</i>

<i>You always said he was ugly.</i>
<i>I never said that.</i>

You say shit like that about everyone.

35:56.821 --> 35:58.781
The door's open!

36:02.785 --> 36:04.704
Close the door!

36:23.806 --> 36:24.891
Don't look.

36:24.974 --> 36:25.975
Don't look.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.151
OK. It's OK.

36:52.877 --> 36:54.253
Daddy.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.216
Daddy.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.969
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

37:02.595 --> 37:03.638
Let me see.

37:03.721 --> 37:05.223
I want to get out.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.768
He took them out of his mouth.

37:08.851 --> 37:11.395
I want to go home.

37:12.980 --> 37:14.398
You can't eat them.

37:15.608 --> 37:17.610
Am I... Am I supposed to eat these?

37:18.277 --> 37:20.029
I want to go home.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.282
I mean,
I-I guess I didn't think about that.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.576
There's a guy, he's under a blue tarp.

37:25.660 --> 37:27.203
He sells needles for a buck. Can you--

37:27.286 --> 37:29.247
-I'm not going back out there.
-Yes.

37:30.873 --> 37:31.874
No.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.918
I think I don't like this car.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.169
All right, listen.

37:36.879 --> 37:38.798
I need you to take me to a pharmacy...

37:39.799 --> 37:42.134
before I die in your fucking car, OK?

37:42.218 --> 37:43.678
OK, I just need a second,

37:43.761 --> 37:46.222
because I'm just a bit overwhelmed
with what just happened.

37:46.305 --> 37:48.432
-Please go to the pharmacy.
-What we should do--

45:48.120 --> 45:49.121
In there.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.763
Are you OK?

46:50.641 --> 46:51.850
You're OK.

47:07.032 --> 47:09.076
Is that a little monkey I hear?

47:10.244 --> 47:12.579
How did a cute little monkey
sneak in here?

47:13.789 --> 47:16.166
I got... shit everywhere.

47:16.250 --> 47:20.087
We don't care about
no stinky poop, do we?

47:20.170 --> 47:22.965
We <i>love</i> poop, don't we?

47:23.048 --> 47:25.634

47:34.059 --> 47:35.310
Seth, what are you doing?

47:35.811 --> 47:36.812
Stop.

47:37.437 --> 47:39.273
Seth, stop.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.275
Daddy hurt his hand.
Can you kiss it?

47:41.358 --> 47:43.193
Can you kiss it? Thank you.

47:45.070 --> 47:46.321
Do you know what time it is? Put your arms out.

47:47.739 --> 47:49.324
It's chopper time!

47:54.329 --> 47:55.372
Let's chopper out!

47:55.455 --> 47:57.708
It's time to chopper out!

47:59.459 --> 48:01.086
Chopper out!

48:01.878 --> 48:03.755
Chopper out!

48:03.839 --> 48:05.507
Chopper out!

48:05.591 --> 48:08.093
Chopper landing.

48:09.761 --> 48:11.597
Let's go. Let's go. We want to play.

49:00.395 --> 49:04.691
No. It's just been, like,
such a... crazy night.

49:04.775 --> 49:05.776
Um...

49:06.276 --> 49:09.821
The cake took so long, and we got a flat.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.198
I'm going to eat them.

49:14.409 --> 49:15.410
He bit me!

49:15.494 --> 49:17.412
Hold on, sweetie.
I can't hear you.

49:17.496 --> 49:18.997
You've got to bite him back!

49:19.081 --> 49:20.874
-You've got to bite him!
-I love you, too.

49:20.957 --> 49:23.418
-Save us, quickly!
-No, I'll be home really, really soon.

49:24.002 --> 49:25.962
Yes, you bit his head off!

49:26.046 --> 49:28.090
You saved humanity!

49:28.173 --> 49:29.424
Oh, my gosh!

49:29.508 --> 49:30.801
You're my hero.

49:31.343 --> 49:32.844
You're my hero, you know that?

49:37.265 --> 49:38.308
Oh, shit.

49:38.809 --> 49:39.810
What?

49:41.311 --> 49:44.106
OK, you've got to...
you've got to promise not to kill me.

49:45.190 --> 49:46.191
What?

49:52.906 --> 49:54.491
Are you fucking kidding me?

49:55.075 --> 49:57.911
-I don't want it. You take it.

49:59.663 --> 50:02.040
I'm sure she'll be very happy to see you.

50:02.624 --> 50:03.709
Fuck you.

50:03.792 --> 50:06.336
Language! There's a child present.

50:20.100 --> 50:21.059
Oh, no.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.145
Uh-uh.

50:23.854 --> 50:25.856
-I have the key.
-I don't care.

50:25.939 --> 50:28.984
She's going to get in so much trouble.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.737
You don't want me
to just hand you the key right now?

50:31.820 --> 50:33.780
No, because we're closed right now.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.157
Are you fucking kidding me?

50:35.240 --> 50:37.075
No, I'm not kidding you. You can go now.

50:37.159 --> 50:40.620
They locked the door. They locked
her out. She is not going to be happy.

50:45.208 --> 50:47.210
Oh, sh-- Yes.

50:47.794 --> 50:49.463
Yes! Let's go! Let's go!

50:49.546 --> 50:53.383
Chopper out! Chopper out! Let's go!

50:54.968 --> 50:55.969
I got you.

50:56.052 --> 50:57.888
OK. Oh, fuck!

50:57.971 --> 51:00.182
That's right. That's right.
We are choppers.

51:00.265 --> 51:01.975
-Go! Go!
-Put your seat belt on!

51:03.894 --> 51:05.103
Oh!

51:05.187 --> 51:06.563
Shit!

51:07.647 --> 51:10.066
Oh! Drive! Just fucking drive!

51:10.150 --> 51:11.818
-You're a mess! Go!
-OK, OK, OK!

51:15.322 --> 51:17.115
Chopper out!

51:23.497 --> 51:24.498
Hey.

51:25.832 --> 51:27.626
-She's fine.
Oh, you got through?

51:27.709 --> 51:30.128
-She's with Seth, and she's fine.

51:30.962 --> 51:31.963
Oh. Oh.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.219
-She told me he went home.
-Don't do this. Don't.

51:37.302 --> 51:40.180
-No, don't make him call her back.

51:40.263 --> 51:42.641
-She sounded fine.
-I want to hear the sound of her voice.

51:42.724 --> 51:44.059
Please, just call her back.

51:47.562 --> 51:49.397
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

51:56.279 --> 51:59.950
Dad was, like,
driving 90 miles an hour up the five,

52:00.033 --> 52:03.620
and I had to stick my head
out the window to puke.

52:03.703 --> 52:06.289
You really don't remember?
This was, like, a big moment.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.874
I don't think so. Keep going.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.919
So I puke out the window
and everything just...

52:11.002 --> 52:12.170
Comes back on the car?

52:12.254 --> 52:15.882
Came back on the whole side of
the car, and they couldn't see anything.

52:15.966 --> 52:16.967
Oh, yeah.

52:17.050 --> 52:19.094
We get to Santa Barbara
and Dad gets out.

52:19.177 --> 52:20.428
He was fucking pissed.

52:20.512 --> 52:23.098
"Who the fuck puked
all over the side of my car?"

52:25.016 --> 52:29.229
I just don't understand how he thought
someone else puked on his car.

52:32.190 --> 52:34.234
Dad always says
the exact same thing.

52:34.860 --> 52:35.861
What?

52:37.320 --> 52:38.738
You know. Think about it.

52:41.992 --> 52:43.076
All right, yeah.

52:43.827 --> 52:47.205
"Suck it up,
walk it off, grow a pair."

52:48.081 --> 52:49.791
And then let them dangle.

52:50.375 --> 52:51.751
I don't remember that part.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.503
I think that's a new addition.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.588
Maybe.

52:56.548 --> 52:58.758
Dad doesn't joke
with me any more. It's weird.

52:58.842 --> 53:02.137
<i>In 1.3 miles,</i>
<i>turn left onto North Figueroa Street,</i>

53:02.220 --> 53:05.348
<i>then merge onto CA 110 North</i>

53:07.434 --> 53:08.935
I know what Mom will say, too.

53:09.769 --> 53:10.770
What?

53:12.647 --> 53:14.232
She'll tell me I broke her heart.

53:15.567 --> 53:17.527
She really loves to tell me that.

53:24.743 --> 53:25.744
Hey, Ella.

53:26.494 --> 53:27.954
You want to see monkey brain?

53:29.497 --> 53:30.498
Bleugh!

53:31.833 --> 53:33.168
Like that monkey brain?

53:38.006 --> 53:39.966
A kitty! A kitty!

53:42.135 --> 53:43.136
A cheetah.

53:53.229 --> 53:54.689
I think I can do it this time.

53:57.150 --> 53:58.568
It feels different, you know?

53:59.486 --> 54:00.487
Yeah.

54:03.531 --> 54:06.076
I know what I've got to do
and I'm just going to do it.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.081
<i>In 200 feet, keep left.</i>

54:15.961 --> 54:19.839
Oh, look, they're right over my house.
Have you ever been over on the fourth?

54:20.715 --> 54:21.800
No, I don't think so.

54:22.467 --> 54:23.468
<i>Keep left.</i>

54:23.551 --> 54:24.970
And a blue one.

54:28.556 --> 54:29.849
Should we go check them out?

54:30.809 --> 54:33.061
Let's do it. It will be fun.
Come on, let's do it.

54:33.561 --> 54:35.355
Come on, let's go check them out,

54:35.438 --> 54:38.066
and then... and then we can go
to that place in Pasadena.

54:38.149 --> 54:41.277
-I really don't think it's a good idea.
-It's not going to make a difference.

54:41.361 --> 54:42.612
I'll be fine. I promise.

54:48.618 --> 54:51.246
-Really, really. Yeah, I swear.

54:55.291 --> 54:56.793
I've got to go get the cake.

54:57.502 --> 54:58.920
Is that a yes?

54:59.004 --> 55:00.088
Fireworks?

55:00.171 --> 55:03.675
We're going to see fireworks, baby!

55:04.259 --> 55:07.679
Yes! Let's go eat those fireworks.

55:07.762 --> 55:09.514
I'm sick of fries and burger.

55:09.597 --> 55:11.641
I want fireworks.

55:12.183 --> 55:14.102
Oh! I'm going to eat a pink one...

55:14.894 --> 55:15.895
and a blue one,

55:15.979 --> 55:18.356
and I might even dip my fries
in the fireworks.

not to sing any more.

55:29.451 --> 55:31.286
I cannot do anything of the sort.

55:31.369 --> 55:33.997
You sing the same song
with different words.

55:34.080 --> 55:36.041
-You just list things.
-I will attempt.

55:36.124 --> 55:40.170
-It's just you listing items and things.
-I cannot make any definitive promises.

55:41.379 --> 55:42.380
That's it.

55:42.464 --> 55:45.216
Jealousy does not look good on you.
It doesn't.

55:45.300 --> 55:48.219
I'm so jealous
of these song skills, right?

55:48.303 --> 55:50.972
You know what?
You're either born with it or you're not.

55:51.056 --> 55:52.974
-I'm not worth it.
-I can't even take credit.

55:53.058 --> 55:54.184

56:22.462 --> 56:25.632

It's me.

59:17.637 --> 59:19.180
Look what I found.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.099
-Hey.
-He's here.

59:21.182 --> 59:22.892
Hey, Seth. It's good to see you.

59:22.976 --> 59:24.185
Hi, Ella.

59:24.894 --> 59:26.187
Did you um...

59:26.980 --> 59:28.398
lie to me before?

59:29.732 --> 59:33.444
Because I feel like there is something...
really something going on.

59:35.613 --> 59:37.865
Let's get that firework.

59:37.949 --> 59:39.909
I want to get up there
and touch the firework.  <i>Tell me where you were</i>
<i>and what happened.</i>

59:42.036 --> 59:44.205
I don't feel like we need
to talk about it this minute.

59:44.289 --> 59:46.165
-You are scaring me.
-OK, just...

59:50.628 --> 59:52.922
Come on, Seth. Slow down, OK?

59:53.506 --> 59:54.549
Seth.

59:54.632 --> 59:57.468
So, what, is he high right now, or...?

59:59.429 --> 1:00:03.141
-I wanted to hear it from you.

1:00:03.224 --> 1:00:04.892
I wasn't sure.

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:10.023
Seth, she's going to hit her head.
Honey, please. She could--

1:00:10.106 --> 1:00:14.068
Mom, we can't slow down if we're going
to chopper up to the fireworks!

1:00:14.152 --> 1:00:16.070
We can't stop! We can't stop!

1:00:16.654 --> 1:00:18.114
We can't stop! We can't stop!

1:00:18.197 --> 1:00:20.825
How do you expect to have a relationship
if you keep stuff from me?

1:00:20.908 --> 1:00:23.411
-It's not about you.
-I know. I know it's not about me.

1:00:23.494 --> 1:00:26.372
I'm not keeping anything from you.
I'm just, like... I am trying to--

1:00:26.456 --> 1:00:29.667
If you say you are compartmentalizing,
I swear to God...

1:00:29.751 --> 1:00:30.877
It's me and Dad.

1:00:31.836 --> 1:00:33.338
<i>We should let my parents in.</i>

1:00:33.421 --> 1:00:35.340

Your mom thinks...

1:00:45.141 --> 1:00:46.184

1:00:47.894 --> 1:00:49.646
Katie, come here.
-I'm fine.

1:00:50.271 --> 1:00:51.564
I'm fine.

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:55.193
OK, I'm an adult and Seth is an adult,
and there's just nothing you guys can do.

1:00:55.276 --> 1:00:57.487
There's nothing
anyone can do for him, babe.

<i>You want me to just leave him?</i>

1:01:06.829 --> 1:01:09.916
I wish he would just suck it up already
and get over it. I really do.

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:12.210
It breaks my heart every time.

1:01:12.293 --> 1:01:16.172
Yeah, I think that he...
knows both of those things.

1:02:03.928 --> 1:02:06.139
Something that is actually important.

1:02:08.182 --> 1:02:10.560
<i>And now... let go.</i>

1:02:17.984 --> 1:02:18.985
Daddy

1:02:46.137 --> 1:02:48.890
Ella, come here.
What are you doing, hey?

1:02:49.640 --> 1:02:50.641
What?

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:52.852
Yes.

1:02:54.979 --> 1:02:56.522
Hey.

1:02:56.606 --> 1:02:58.816
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since uh...

1:03:00.401 --> 1:03:01.402
Cutie!

1:03:05.198 --> 1:03:07.658
Honey. Katie. Katie.
-No, no. I got it. I got it.

1:03:13.080 --> 1:03:14.081
Seth?

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:19.921
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Is Seth...?

1:04:08.135 --> 1:04:09.303
Did you bring me cake?

1:04:10.638 --> 1:04:12.640
-No!
-Ouch!

1:04:19.438 --> 1:04:21.858
So, was that a yes or a no on the cake?

1:04:22.567 --> 1:04:24.527
When I'm with you, all I see is you.

1:04:27.530 --> 1:04:28.823
What song is that?

1:04:31.033 --> 1:04:32.285
<i>♪ I close my eyes ♪</i>

1:04:32.368 --> 1:04:33.369
Stop it.

1:04:33.452 --> 1:04:35.913
<i>♪ And all I see is you ♪</i>

1:04:35.997 --> 1:04:36.831
Stop.

1:04:36.914 --> 1:04:38.332
<i>♪ I close my eyes... ♪</i>

1:04:38.416 --> 1:04:40.543
Stop it! Jesus, stop!

1:04:40.626 --> 1:04:42.962
God, you suck me in and I can't get out.

1:04:46.549 --> 1:04:50.595
I-I'm not even trying to be funny,
but I'm pretty sure that's a song, too.

1:04:50.678 --> 1:04:52.388
-Don't.

1:04:52.471 --> 1:04:53.639
No, I don't.

1:04:57.059 --> 1:04:58.269
You promised.

1:04:58.352 --> 1:04:59.395
OK.

1:04:59.478 --> 1:05:02.356
-You do this every fucking time.
-All right. Just calm down.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.817
Don't tell me to calm down.
It makes me insane!

1:05:04.901 --> 1:05:07.445
I didn't mean that. OK, I'm sorry.

1:05:15.703 --> 1:05:18.331
Did something happen... to you?

1:05:18.414 --> 1:05:20.625
Did something happen to you
to make you like this?

1:05:20.708 --> 1:05:22.209
No, nothing happened.

1:05:25.379 --> 1:05:27.006
We came from the same place, so...

1:05:28.174 --> 1:05:30.217
Yeah, look at <i>you.</i>

1:05:31.719 --> 1:05:34.388
Wow!
Look at that girl right there.

1:05:36.682 --> 1:05:38.768
I have done everything for you.

1:05:38.851 --> 1:05:39.977
OK.

1:05:40.603 --> 1:05:45.316
Wasted my whole fucking life
because I'm always... somewhere with you.

1:05:45.399 --> 1:05:47.276
Yeah, all right, man. Let's... Let's go.

1:05:47.818 --> 1:05:50.488
-To the... the Pasadena place.

1:05:50.571 --> 1:05:52.907
I'm ready. Let's do it.
You can drive me now.

<i>You board the same boat.</i>

1:06:11.884 --> 1:06:14.679
<i>The boat is filling with water.</i>
<i>Admit to yourself.</i>

1:06:14.762 --> 1:06:16.514
I feel like I'm having a heart attack.

1:06:16.597 --> 1:06:18.975
You're not.
No, you're not having a heart attack.

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:21.185
<i>Notice the gathering clouds.</i>

1:06:21.268 --> 1:06:22.979
I can't breathe right now.

1:06:23.062 --> 1:06:24.647
Katie. Katie, you're breathing.

1:06:24.730 --> 1:06:27.233
-You're breathing right now.
-I feel like I'm drowning.

1:06:27.316 --> 1:06:30.111
-Everything's going to be fine.

1:06:52.675 --> 1:06:53.634
<i>I will.</i>

1:06:55.011 --> 1:06:56.095

I-I will, I promise.

1:06:57.888 --> 1:06:59.724
You need to get out!

1:06:59.807 --> 1:07:01.934
-I want you to be clean so bad.
-Yeah, I know.

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:04.770
I know. Me, too.
-You really have to do it this time.

1:07:04.854 --> 1:07:07.273
Katie, I'm going to do it.
I-I can. I can do it.

1:07:07.356 --> 1:07:08.357
I know.

1:07:12.862 --> 1:07:14.405
But I can't take you.

What?

1:07:35.509 --> 1:07:36.552
