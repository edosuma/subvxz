00:02.240 --> 00:04.108
<i>(Male announcer) Previously
on Hell's Kitchen... </i>

00:04.142 --> 00:05.342
I thought I was going home broke.

00:05.377 --> 00:07.044
(Announcer) Robyn survived
another elimination.

00:07.079 --> 00:09.046
I feel like I am out of chances right now.

00:09.081 --> 00:11.382
(Announcer) Then, in the
three-course relay challenge...

00:11.416 --> 00:12.683
<i>You have 30 minutes</i>

00:12.718 --> 00:15.219
<i>to cook me three stunning entrees.</i>

00:15.253 --> 00:16.887
Just mass chaos.

00:16.922 --> 00:18.823
(Announcer) Communication was key.

00:18.857 --> 00:20.191
Fish in the oven here. The
lambs in the oven there.

00:20.225 --> 00:21.692
(Announcer) But both the red team...

00:21.727 --> 00:23.327
It's already burning on the bottom.

00:23.361 --> 00:24.895
(Announcer) And the blue team...

00:24.930 --> 00:26.530
He's gotta go faster now.

00:26.565 --> 00:27.732
Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on.

00:27.766 --> 00:28.466
(Announcer) Failed.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.533
[Bleep].

00:29.568 --> 00:31.368
Point goes to... none of you.

00:31.403 --> 00:32.970
(Announcer) In historic fashion...

00:33.004 --> 00:34.972
For the first time ever... 

00:35.006 --> 00:36.907
<i>in Hell's Kitchen history,</i>

00:36.942 --> 00:39.744
I cannot pick a winner.

00:39.778 --> 00:41.512
(Announcer) Before dinner service,

00:41.546 --> 00:43.514
Chef Ramsay sought to inspire the Chefs.

00:43.548 --> 00:44.782
[All exclaiming]

00:44.816 --> 00:46.584
You're cooking for a black jacket.

00:46.618 --> 00:48.285
I'm like, "holy shit, this is real now."

00:48.320 --> 00:50.020
(Announcer) The red team...

00:50.055 --> 00:51.756
Never mix and old
risotto with a fresh one.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.324
(Announcer) Was able to
overcome small mistakes.

00:53.358 --> 00:54.692
Ooh, [Bleep]. Hey, all right.

00:54.726 --> 00:56.127
Got that out of my system.

00:56.161 --> 00:57.394
Let's finish strong.

00:57.429 --> 00:59.096
<i>(Gordon) Service, please.</i>

00:59.131 --> 01:00.598
(Announcer) To deliver
an impressive performance.

01:00.632 --> 01:01.932
Christina, very nice, that risotto.

01:01.967 --> 01:04.200
There's no greater way to celebrate

01:04.236 --> 01:05.636
than put on a black jacket!

01:05.670 --> 01:07.204
[Cheering]

01:07.239 --> 01:08.939
Congratulations.

01:08.974 --> 01:10.741
(Announcer) It was a different
story on the blue team.

01:10.776 --> 01:12.309
Hey! Stop! Come here!

01:12.344 --> 01:13.978
- (Announcer) Clemenza...
- How long?

01:14.012 --> 01:15.212
Gonna be three more minutes.

01:15.247 --> 01:16.514
- Hurry up then!
- Yes!

01:16.548 --> 01:17.448
(Announcer) Struggled on appetizers.

01:17.482 --> 01:18.582
All of you, come here!

01:18.617 --> 01:20.618
Multicolored [Bleep] risotto!

01:20.652 --> 01:22.720
(Announcer) Brian imploded
on the meat station.

01:22.754 --> 01:24.054
Raw! Perfect!

01:24.089 --> 01:25.623
And medium-rare,

01:25.657 --> 01:27.424
and sliced in a [Bleep] door wedge!

01:27.459 --> 01:28.592
Stupid me.

01:28.627 --> 01:30.528
(Announcer) Justin failed on fish.

01:30.562 --> 01:32.363
You reheat the same bass?

01:32.397 --> 01:34.031
- Is that your best?
- No, Chef!

01:34.065 --> 01:35.633
That was just a dumb, dumb mistake.

01:35.667 --> 01:37.101
(Announcer) And Robyn...

01:37.135 --> 01:38.302
They told me to hold it in here.

01:38.336 --> 01:39.303
- Who told you?
- My team did.

01:39.337 --> 01:41.105
They said it's a holding oven.

01:41.139 --> 01:42.339
- (Announcer) Found little support...
- What?

01:42.374 --> 01:43.507
They said it's a holding oven!

01:43.542 --> 01:44.542
(Announcer) Amongst here teammates.

01:44.576 --> 01:45.576
<i>- (Clemenza) No. No.
- What?</i>

01:45.610 --> 01:47.244
- I didn't tell her that.
- Don't lie.

01:47.279 --> 01:49.346
<i>(Justin) That's not what
we said. That's a lie.</i>

01:49.381 --> 01:51.182
(Announcer) At elimination, Chef Ramsay

01:51.216 --> 01:53.317
thought everyone on the blue
team needed to make their case.

01:53.351 --> 01:55.853
I want all four of you to step forward.

01:55.887 --> 01:59.456
(Announcer) Then, Justin and Clemenza
were the first two blue team members

01:59.491 --> 02:01.492
to receive black jackets,

02:01.526 --> 02:05.763
forcing Chef Ramsay to make
his most difficult decision yet.

02:05.797 --> 02:07.264
Put that on.

02:07.299 --> 02:08.499
(Announcer) And so it was...

02:08.532 --> 02:09.900
Brian.

02:09.935 --> 02:12.002
(Announcer) Whose dream
of becoming Head Chef

02:12.037 --> 02:13.504
at Gordon Ramsay Steak
at Paris, Las Vegas,

02:13.538 --> 02:15.306

I'm so [Bleep] stoked right now.

03:20.772 --> 03:22.573
(Clemenza) It feels great
to have this jacket on.

03:37.422 --> 03:38.989
Good job, buddy.

03:39.024 --> 03:41.025
(Christina) I'm thrilled
with the black jacket,

03:41.059 --> 03:43.027
and now, to see that,
like, beautiful knife.

03:43.061 --> 03:45.663
Insane! Insane.

03:45.697 --> 03:47.765
[Singsong] We got black jackets.

03:47.799 --> 03:50.100
We got black jackets.

03:50.135 --> 03:51.468
[Squeals] Yay!

03:51.503 --> 03:53.837
What's up? Who looks good in black?

03:53.872 --> 03:54.972
I do!

03:55.006 --> 03:57.074
It's weird to celebrate with Robyn,

03:57.108 --> 03:59.810
but... we're all, like,
having a good time.

03:59.844 --> 04:00.844
And it's fun.

04:00.879 --> 04:03.881
[Laughs] That was hot.

04:05.417 --> 04:07.017
It's been a wild [Bleep] night, man.

04:07.052 --> 04:09.353
<i>- 18 people. 6.
- Yeah.</i>

04:09.387 --> 04:11.288
We knocked out two-thirds
of the competition.

04:11.323 --> 04:13.290
Now it's time to go for the jugular.

04:13.325 --> 04:14.892
Yeah.

04:14.926 --> 04:16.694
(Justin) The stakes are
definitely higher now, you know.

04:16.728 --> 04:17.928
It's down to the last six.

04:17.963 --> 04:19.430
I'm really, really focused right now.

04:19.464 --> 04:20.764
The best of me is definitely yet to come.

04:20.798 --> 04:22.666
I'm ready to win this whole thing.

(Announcer) The Chefs
awake as one elite team.

04:31.576 --> 04:34.244
<i>- Hi, new team.
- Yeah, we're all a team now, man.</i>

04:34.279 --> 04:37.181
(Announcer) And Chef Ramsay has
invited two world-renowned Chefs...

04:37.215 --> 04:39.083
Look at that. Love it.

04:39.117 --> 04:40.818
(Announcer) To turn up the
heat on the next challenge.

04:40.852 --> 04:43.153
[Singsong] I smell something cookin'.

04:43.188 --> 04:44.621
<i>Let's go. Good morning.</i>

04:44.656 --> 04:45.756
(All) Good morning, Chef.

04:45.790 --> 04:46.824
How about good morning to our Chefs?

04:46.858 --> 04:47.591
(All) Good morning, Chefs.

04:47.625 --> 04:48.225
Hey, guys. Good morning.

04:48.259 --> 04:49.526
Yeah.

04:49.561 --> 04:50.894
I see these two Chefs.

04:50.929 --> 04:52.596
And I see, obviously, Chef Ramsay,

04:52.630 --> 04:54.098
and I see three domes there.

04:54.132 --> 04:56.600
I'm thinking there's gonna be,
like, a live chicken under one,

04:56.634 --> 04:58.702
a little man under the
other, and [Bleep] hand's

04:58.737 --> 05:00.704
gonna pop out of the
table from the third dome.

05:00.739 --> 05:02.006
I don't know what the [Bleep] going on.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.807
The final six. As you can see, we have two

05:03.842 --> 05:05.376
very distinguished guests.

05:05.410 --> 05:08.812
<i>On my far right, Chef Ludo Lefebvre.</i>

05:08.847 --> 05:10.881
<i>Executive Chef of L.A.'s favorite pop-up,</i>

05:10.915 --> 05:12.116
<i>Ludobites.</i>

05:12.150 --> 05:14.351
And next, a dear friend of mine,

05:14.386 --> 05:16.720
<i>Chef Quinn Hatfield, of the
amazing Hatfield's. Good morning.</i>

05:16.755 --> 05:17.955
Recipient of a Michelin star.

05:17.989 --> 05:19.023
<i>- Wow.
- Okay.</i>

05:19.057 --> 05:20.190
Today, I've asked both Ludo

05:20.225 --> 05:21.592
and Quinn to prepare

05:21.626 --> 05:23.394
one of their signature dishes.

05:23.428 --> 05:25.162
I've prepared one of mine as well.

05:25.196 --> 05:27.898
<i>And each of these dishes is a great</i>

05:27.932 --> 05:29.900
modern take on a classic.

05:29.934 --> 05:31.068
<i>Let's begin with Chef Ludo.</i>

05:31.102 --> 05:32.436
Yes, Chef.

05:32.470 --> 05:34.271
This is our first challenge.
For the black jackets.

05:34.305 --> 05:35.773
All right, Chef Ramsay, what is it?

05:35.807 --> 05:36.707
Let's go. Give it to me.

05:36.741 --> 05:38.442
This is a unique caprese salad.

05:38.476 --> 05:40.044
Think about what sets this dish

05:40.078 --> 05:41.745
from the classics you've seen.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.480
(Announcer) A traditional caprese salad

05:43.515 --> 05:45.282
consists of fresh buffalo mozzarella,

05:45.316 --> 05:47.251
tomatoes, and basil.

05:47.285 --> 05:50.387
But Chef Ludo's take on
this modern Italian classic

05:50.422 --> 05:51.588
has added some twists.

05:51.623 --> 05:52.890
Instead of tomatoes,

05:52.924 --> 05:55.092
Chef Ludo used red bell peppers.

05:55.126 --> 05:57.494
And that's not buffalo mozzarella.

05:57.529 --> 05:59.463
That's a feta cheese mousse.

05:59.497 --> 06:01.131
Okay, what's the elements in there?

06:01.166 --> 06:02.132
Hazelnut crumble?

06:02.167 --> 06:03.434
<i>[Buzzer] No?</i>

06:03.468 --> 06:04.601
<i>It could have been fresh ricotta.</i>

06:04.636 --> 06:05.469
<i>[Buzzer] Mm-mmm.</i>

06:05.503 --> 06:06.670
That's wrong.

06:06.704 --> 06:08.439
Tastes like buffalo mozzarella.

06:08.473 --> 06:10.040
Ludo, would you be so kind
to explain this unique dish?

06:14.946 --> 06:17.548
Oh, my God, nobody got
anything right on that dish.

06:17.582 --> 06:19.016
But no harm, no foul...

06:19.050 --> 06:21.085
we're going into round two, still even.

06:21.119 --> 06:23.353
<i>Okay, let's move on to Chef Quinn's dish.</i>

06:23.388 --> 06:25.355
(Announcer) Chef Quinn's
dish is a seafood pasta.

06:25.390 --> 06:27.224
But that's not pasta.

06:27.258 --> 06:28.625
That's salsify.

06:28.660 --> 06:31.128
And now the black
team's hoping, this time,

06:31.162 --> 06:32.529
they can impress the Chefs.

06:32.564 --> 06:33.831
What's the pasta?

06:33.865 --> 06:35.365
Well, it's definitely not pasta.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.567
<i>I thought it was almost a potato.</i>

06:36.601 --> 06:37.568
<i>(Gordon) Potato?</i>

06:37.602 --> 06:38.735
Yeah.

06:38.770 --> 06:40.037
So the noodle is made out of salsify.

06:40.071 --> 06:41.038
Salsify.

06:41.072 --> 06:43.273
[All chuckle]

06:43.308 --> 06:44.942
Come on. How many of you got that?

06:44.976 --> 06:46.110
<i>Okay.</i>

06:46.144 --> 06:51.148
Those first two dishes were a warm-up.

06:51.182 --> 06:52.883
For your real challenge,

06:52.917 --> 06:55.486
it's now time...

06:55.520 --> 06:57.121
to Taste It, Now Make It.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.755
[Laughter]

06:58.790 --> 07:00.090
[Sighs]

07:00.125 --> 07:01.391
I knew it!

07:01.426 --> 07:02.826
I knew it was gonna be
Taste It, Now Make It.

07:02.861 --> 07:04.128
So I'm kind of nervous,

07:04.162 --> 07:06.597
especially after I bombed
on the practice test.

07:06.631 --> 07:09.900
<i>I'd like you all to thank
Chef Ludo and Chef Quinn.</i>

07:09.934 --> 07:11.335
Thank you, Chefs. Thank
you very much, Chefs.

07:11.369 --> 07:12.369
Thanks, Quinn. Thanks, Ludo.

07:12.403 --> 07:15.839
<i>Okay, today you'll be working
and competing in pairs.</i>

07:15.874 --> 07:18.642
<i>Clemenza, you're pairing up with Dana.</i>

07:18.676 --> 07:20.043
Uh, Justin, you've got Barbie.

07:20.078 --> 07:21.311
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

07:21.346 --> 07:23.847
Good. Christina, Robyn, you're together.

07:23.882 --> 07:26.984
<i>The pair that comes the
closest wins the challenge.</i>

07:27.018 --> 07:28.118
- Everybody ready?
- (All) Yes, Chef!

07:28.153 --> 07:32.322
You have 30 minutes to
recreate this stunning dish,

07:32.357 --> 07:35.159
starting from now. Let's go.

07:35.193 --> 07:37.294
I'm super excited, man.
I've been waiting for this.

07:37.328 --> 07:39.429
I know that I'm good at this challenge.

07:39.464 --> 07:40.597
(Announcer) In the Taste
It, Now Make It challenge...

07:40.632 --> 07:41.999
<i>Coming over the top.</i>

07:42.033 --> 07:43.133
(Announcer) Each team must recreate

07:43.168 --> 07:44.501
Chef Ramsay's signature dish

07:44.536 --> 07:47.271
from sight, smell, and taste alone.

07:47.305 --> 07:48.739
Ah, are you kidding me, Clemenza?

07:48.773 --> 07:49.673
<i>- Clemenza...
- Yes, Chef?</i>

07:49.707 --> 07:50.874
<i>Don't eat it all.</i>

07:50.909 --> 07:52.509
Everybody's just [Bleep] diggin' in.

07:52.544 --> 07:54.044
It was like six people
just got let out of jail

07:54.078 --> 07:55.812
that haven't eaten in, like, five days.

07:55.847 --> 07:57.548
Mmm. Taste it.

07:57.582 --> 07:59.850
The first bite, I'm like,
"okay, is it pork or is it veal?"

07:59.884 --> 08:01.785
But as I'm recognizing the texture

08:01.819 --> 08:04.421
and the flavor, I'm pretty
certain that it's veal.

08:04.455 --> 08:06.156
Guys, can you start cooking?

08:09.894 --> 08:11.128
You're right.

08:11.162 --> 08:12.863
It's not pork. It's veal.

08:12.897 --> 08:14.831
(Announcer) All three teams have decided

08:14.866 --> 08:17.334
that the protein in Chef
Ramsay's dish is veal.

08:17.368 --> 08:19.937
Then I went on to what
the veal was coated in.

08:19.971 --> 08:21.438
- What is this?
- Serrano ham.

08:21.472 --> 08:22.940
- You sure?
- Serrano ham.

08:22.974 --> 08:24.508
And there was just a texture about it

08:24.542 --> 08:27.878
that made me think it was
serrano ham and not prosciutto.

08:27.912 --> 08:29.479
But it wasn't wrapped in prosciutto.

08:29.514 --> 08:30.814
I think it was serrano ham.

08:30.848 --> 08:32.883
I'm a little uncertain,
but it seemed to be

08:32.917 --> 08:34.918
a thinner slice of ham on the outside.

08:34.953 --> 08:36.852
So we're going with the serrano.

08:36.888 --> 08:39.022
(Announcer) Barbie,
Justin, Christina, and Robyn

08:39.057 --> 08:40.924
have all chosen to wrap their protein

08:40.958 --> 08:42.693
in serrano ham. However...

08:42.727 --> 08:44.795
Is this serrano ham or prosciutto?

08:44.829 --> 08:47.698
(Announcer) Dana and Clemenza are
still considering other possibilities.

08:47.732 --> 08:49.199
No, it's prosciutto. Prosciutto.

08:49.234 --> 08:50.567
Yeah.

08:50.602 --> 08:53.403
I eat prosciutto here,
like, a half a pound a day.

08:53.438 --> 08:55.172
Who else eats the prosciutto?

08:55.206 --> 08:56.673
Clemenza.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.642
So if we can't tell that
this is [Bleep] prosciutto,

08:58.676 --> 09:00.210
then we deserve to lose.

09:00.245 --> 09:01.812
(Announcer) Confident
in their cured meats,

09:01.846 --> 09:04.848
Dana and Clemenza choose to
wrap their veal in prosciutto.

09:04.882 --> 09:06.049
Okay, 15 minutes to go.

09:06.084 --> 09:07.184
<i>15 minutes to go.</i>

09:07.218 --> 09:08.452
<i>(Gordon) Let's go.</i>

09:08.486 --> 09:09.820
<i>Clemenza, taste the puree.</i>

09:09.854 --> 09:11.154
I think that could have
been a white bean puree.

09:11.189 --> 09:13.323
Hey, I think it's the white bean puree.

09:13.358 --> 09:14.625
I think we're right.

09:14.659 --> 09:16.727
The taste seemed really familiar,

09:16.761 --> 09:18.295
but it didn't click to me

09:18.329 --> 09:19.696
until I was walking around the ingredients

09:19.731 --> 09:21.198
and I saw the white bean.

09:21.232 --> 09:22.399
That was in the puree.

09:22.433 --> 09:23.667
That's it!

09:23.701 --> 09:26.837
(Announcer) There is a clear consensus
among the Chefs that the puree

09:26.871 --> 09:28.905
in Chef Ramsay's dish
is made from white beans.

09:28.940 --> 09:32.809
And now they must determine
the source of its smoky flavor.

09:34.279 --> 09:37.114
I feel really solid about
what's in the white bean puree.

09:37.148 --> 09:38.515
I think it's bacon base.

09:40.752 --> 09:41.718
Okay.

09:41.753 --> 09:45.022
The bacon, you just need
a little bit. You're good.

09:45.056 --> 09:46.390
(Clemenza) I start making
the white bean puree,

09:46.424 --> 09:48.058
and, uh, tastes right...

09:48.092 --> 09:49.426
but it doesn't look right.

09:49.460 --> 09:50.727
I got it. This horseradish.

09:50.762 --> 09:52.062
- What?
- Trust me on that one.

09:52.096 --> 09:53.497
If you're confident, then do it.

09:53.531 --> 09:55.232
Yeah, I'm redoing it. That sucks.

09:55.266 --> 09:56.466
(Announcer) Instead of smoked bacon,

09:56.501 --> 10:00.103
Dana and Clemenza season their
white bean puree with horseradish.

10:00.138 --> 10:01.438
Five minutes to go, guys.

10:01.472 --> 10:03.006
(Announcer) Now, all three teams

10:03.041 --> 10:04.908
must decode the final element
of Chef Ramsay's dish...

10:04.942 --> 10:05.976
Go, go, go, go!

10:06.010 --> 10:07.477
(Announcer) The sauce.

10:07.512 --> 10:08.912
There's some kind of acid in that sauce.

10:08.946 --> 10:10.614
- Touch of lemon juice?
- Sweetness, something.

10:10.648 --> 10:12.749
Justin went straight for
the dark chicken broth,

10:12.784 --> 10:14.284
but there was this tartness,

10:14.319 --> 10:16.320
and I know it was a fortified wine.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.422
It's definitely port. That's it.

10:19.590 --> 10:20.891
Right here.

10:20.925 --> 10:22.459
Christina and I both taste that madeira,

10:22.493 --> 10:23.627
and then we both taste the port.

10:23.661 --> 10:24.861
- I think it's that one.
- Yep.

10:24.896 --> 10:26.229
We went with the port
instead of the madeira.

10:26.264 --> 10:27.097
There's some sort of wine in it,

10:27.131 --> 10:28.665
what's the wine in it?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.167
There's wine in there.
There's some sort of wine.

10:30.201 --> 10:32.169
- What is it?
- Madeira.

10:32.203 --> 10:34.771
He's like, "madeira!"
And I'm like, "shh! Shh.

10:34.806 --> 10:36.940
Clemenza, don't tell everyone."

10:36.974 --> 10:39.810
(Announcer) Instead of port,
once again Dana and Clemenza

10:39.844 --> 10:41.478
have gone against the grain

10:41.512 --> 10:44.314
and have chosen to use
madeira in their sauce.

10:44.349 --> 10:46.416
<i>(Gordon) Last two minutes!</i>

10:46.451 --> 10:48.452
(Announcer) And now each pair
must quickly focus on plating

10:48.486 --> 10:50.921
as they attempt to recreate
the look of Chef Ramsay's dish.

10:50.955 --> 10:52.122
Dana, we gotta get that meat out.

10:52.156 --> 10:53.490
I know, I know.

10:53.524 --> 10:55.058
- There's two slices or three?
- Three, three.

10:55.093 --> 10:56.493
30 seconds to go. Come on.

10:56.527 --> 10:58.328
(Justin) We're going
for gung ho right now,

10:58.363 --> 10:59.529
and hopefully, it's cooked perfectly.

10:59.564 --> 11:00.764
<i>- (Gordon) Get it on.
- Oh, my God.</i>

11:00.798 --> 11:02.299
- Five...
- Perfect, that is perfect.

11:02.333 --> 11:03.800
<i>- Four...
- The oil, the oil.</i>

11:03.835 --> 11:05.102
<i>- Three...
- Get it up there.</i>

11:05.136 --> 11:06.670
<i>Two...</i>

11:06.704 --> 11:07.671
<i>One...</i>

11:07.705 --> 11:10.006
And stop!

11:10.041 --> 11:12.309
Dana, Clemenza, present your dish, please.

11:12.343 --> 11:14.144
Let's check out the presentation first.

11:14.178 --> 11:16.446
Okay. Side by side.

11:16.481 --> 11:18.515
<i>Okay, tell me what it is.</i>

11:18.549 --> 11:19.716
<i>(Dana) That is a...</i>

11:19.751 --> 11:22.219
prosciutto-wrapped veal.

11:22.253 --> 11:24.020
<i>(Clemenza) The puree is white bean</i>

11:24.055 --> 11:24.955
with a little bit of
horseradish and wasabe.

11:24.989 --> 11:27.057
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

11:27.091 --> 11:28.058
Mmm.

11:28.092 --> 11:30.560
Chef Ramsay is scaring me!

11:30.595 --> 11:32.095
He's like, "hmm... "

11:32.130 --> 11:33.130
Hmm... "

11:33.164 --> 11:34.598
Mm-hmm. What's it wrapped with?

11:34.632 --> 11:35.899
<i>- Prosciutto.
- Prosciutto?</i>

11:35.933 --> 11:37.234
Mm-hmm.

11:37.268 --> 11:39.336
Tell me if it's prosciutto or not!

11:39.370 --> 11:40.904
Okay. Thank you.

11:40.938 --> 11:42.672
Aah! You're killin' me!

11:42.707 --> 11:44.574
<i>Next team. Let's go.</i>

11:44.609 --> 11:46.877
(Justin) I'm 100% confident in our dish.

11:46.911 --> 11:48.779
You wouldn't be able
to tell the difference

11:48.813 --> 11:49.880
between Chef Ramsay's dish and our dish.

11:49.914 --> 11:50.647
It was perfect, on the money.

11:50.681 --> 11:52.082
And, Barbie, what is it?

11:52.116 --> 11:54.351
It is a serrano ham-wrapped veal loin.

11:54.385 --> 11:57.120
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- I definitely picked up on white bean puree.</i>

11:57.155 --> 12:00.490
<i>And I thought that the smokiness
may have come from bacon.</i>

12:00.525 --> 12:02.025
<i>And decided to use a little port</i>

12:02.059 --> 12:03.760
for the tartness and the sweetness.

12:03.795 --> 12:05.128
Okay. Good job. Thank you.

12:05.163 --> 12:06.263
- Thank you, Chef.
- Thank you.

12:06.297 --> 12:07.597
<i>Okay, what is it?</i>

12:07.632 --> 12:10.434
<i>It's, um, the veal wrapped in serrano ham.</i>

12:10.468 --> 12:12.202
<i>Mmm. The white bean puree</i>

12:12.236 --> 12:14.471
with, um, just a little bit of the bacon.

12:14.505 --> 12:16.006
We also put a sauce in there.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.240
<i>It was definitely tawny port.</i>

12:17.275 --> 12:18.842
- That tastes delicious.
- Thank you, Chef.

12:18.876 --> 12:21.311
All the dishes, they're
so close to each other.

12:21.345 --> 12:23.613
And I'm really shaking
in my boots at this point.

12:24.949 --> 12:26.616
Okay, and first, the protein.

12:26.651 --> 12:27.717
You all used veal.

12:27.752 --> 12:29.486
(All) Yes, Chef.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.821
You all got it right.

12:30.855 --> 12:32.055
<i>Congratulations. Good job.</i>

12:32.089 --> 12:33.957
<i>Good job.</i>

12:33.991 --> 12:35.325
And let's move on to the wrapping.

12:35.359 --> 12:36.526
Dana, Clemenza...

12:36.561 --> 12:38.061
<i>Yes. You said prosciutto.</i>

12:38.095 --> 12:39.396
[Sighs] You're the
only ones who said that.

12:41.032 --> 12:42.799
Dana, Clemenza...

12:42.834 --> 12:43.867
you got it right.

12:43.901 --> 12:44.801
<i>- Yeah.
- Well done.</i>

12:44.836 --> 12:46.203
<i>Good job.</i>

12:47.405 --> 12:52.442
Isn't serrano ham the prosciutto of Spain?

12:52.477 --> 12:53.977
Come on!

12:55.379 --> 12:56.480
Dana, Clemenza.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.248
You said white bean puree.

12:58.282 --> 12:59.483
Yes, Chef.

12:59.517 --> 13:01.017
With a touch of smokiness in there.

13:01.052 --> 13:02.385
Yes, horseradish.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.954
But there's no horseradish in the puree.

13:03.988 --> 13:05.255
[Bleep].

13:05.289 --> 13:07.791
There is smoked bacon in the puree.

13:07.825 --> 13:09.960
<i>Which, Christina and
Robyn, congratulations.</i>

13:09.994 --> 13:11.428
Thank you. Thank you.

13:11.462 --> 13:12.362
<i>Barbie, Justin, congratulations.</i>

13:12.396 --> 13:13.263
Thank you, Chef.

13:13.297 --> 13:14.798
(Barbie) It's very suspenseful.

13:14.832 --> 13:16.633
It's down to the minute details.

13:16.667 --> 13:17.667
Sauce.

13:17.702 --> 13:18.935
<i>This, for me,</i>

13:18.970 --> 13:21.171
is the one that clinches it.

13:21.205 --> 13:22.372
<i>Because...</i>

13:22.406 --> 13:25.308
you all pretty much nailed the dish.

13:25.343 --> 13:28.078
(Announcer) If Chef Ramsay's
dish is made with madeira,

13:28.112 --> 13:30.714
then Dana and Clemenza win the challenge.

13:30.748 --> 13:33.483
But if his dish is made with port,

13:33.518 --> 13:35.118
then for the first time ever,

13:35.152 --> 13:37.721
Taste It, Now Make It will end in a tie.

13:37.755 --> 13:38.955
Congratulations...

13:38.990 --> 13:40.457
- My heart right now...
- I know.

13:48.527 --> 13:50.595
(Announcer) In today's Taste
It, Now Make It challenge,

13:50.629 --> 13:52.630
the final six are competing in pairs

13:52.664 --> 13:55.933
to recreate one of Chef
Ramsay's signature dishes.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.202
You all pretty much nailed the dish.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.605
(Announcer) The winners will be
determined by one final detail.

14:00.639 --> 14:02.273
In the sauce...

14:02.307 --> 14:04.242
there was something unique.

14:04.276 --> 14:05.910
- My heart right now...
- I know.

14:05.944 --> 14:07.778
Barbie, Justin, Christina, Robin...

14:07.813 --> 14:09.280
You said port, right?

14:09.314 --> 14:10.581
Dana and Clemenza...

14:10.616 --> 14:13.217
you said a madeira-based sauce.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.186
[Sighs]

14:18.423 --> 14:19.924
Dana and Clemenza, you had the madeira.

14:19.958 --> 14:21.759
- Congratulations.
- Aah!

14:21.793 --> 14:23.694
<i>[Bleep]. Well done.</i>

14:23.729 --> 14:25.162
Yea-hea-hea-hea-heah!

14:25.197 --> 14:27.832
Baby! I [Bleep]... Yes, yes, yes, yes,

14:27.866 --> 14:29.200
and [Bleep] yes!

14:29.234 --> 14:31.002
- Told ya, told ya.
- Really well done indeed.

14:31.036 --> 14:32.637
Yes! Thank you.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.638
Dana, Clemenza...

14:33.672 --> 14:35.006
(Both) Yes, Chef?

14:35.040 --> 14:37.308
You're heading to Silverwood Lake,

14:37.342 --> 14:39.677
where you've got the most
amazing gourmet picnic.

14:39.711 --> 14:40.678
Nice. Cool.

14:40.712 --> 14:41.712
So romantic!

14:41.747 --> 14:44.549
<i>And then each of you will have your own</i>

14:44.583 --> 14:47.351
top-of-the-range jet ski.

14:47.386 --> 14:49.120
Oh! Yes!

14:49.154 --> 14:50.988
I'm really bummed, man.
I love wave-runners.

14:51.023 --> 14:52.657
I mean, they're my [Bleep], you know?

14:52.691 --> 14:53.891
It sucks.

14:53.926 --> 14:55.293
Head upstairs. Get your bathing suits.

14:55.327 --> 14:56.193
<i>- Yes, Chef.
- Well done.</i>

14:56.228 --> 14:57.228
Whoo!

14:57.262 --> 14:59.997
Only thing that can make this day better

15:00.032 --> 15:02.733
is if it were my boyfriend
instead of Clemenza.

15:02.768 --> 15:04.001
Come on, Dana! Move your ass!

15:04.036 --> 15:05.503
We're going jet skiing.

15:05.537 --> 15:06.871
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

15:06.905 --> 15:09.440
you're gonna be in for one miserable day.

15:09.474 --> 15:13.611
<i>I've decided to give the entire
dining room staff the day off.</i>

15:13.645 --> 15:15.680
I would like all the table tops redone.

15:15.714 --> 15:16.681
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

15:16.715 --> 15:18.215
All the linen.

15:18.250 --> 15:19.750
Ironing. [Bleep].

15:19.785 --> 15:21.352
Folding.

15:21.386 --> 15:23.387
Polishing all the flatware.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.789
You're gonna be working with James.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.125
<i>And he is meticulous when it
comes to cleaning, trust me.</i>

15:28.160 --> 15:29.493
(Barbie) I hate cleaning.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.329
Plus, I don't want to iron.

15:31.363 --> 15:33.331
<i>- This is gonna suck.
- (James) All right, come on.</i>

15:33.365 --> 15:35.466
We've actually got a lot to do today.

15:37.035 --> 15:38.336
All right, so...

15:38.370 --> 15:40.738
<i>there's some feather dusters here.</i>

15:40.772 --> 15:42.873
If somebody wants to
start the chandeliers.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.508
- Yeah, baby!
- Bye, James!

15:44.543 --> 15:45.643
<i>(James) You're gonna have a fun day!</i>

15:45.677 --> 15:46.844
Yeah! I'm so excited!

15:46.878 --> 15:48.679
More fun than scrubbing and
cleaning the dining room.

15:48.714 --> 15:50.514
Don't forget to make those
really nice and clean.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.650
Chef Ramsay likes them like that.

15:52.684 --> 15:53.851
[Dana laughs]

15:55.187 --> 15:56.454
Yay!

15:56.488 --> 15:57.888
<i>(Clemenza) Yeah!</i>

15:57.923 --> 15:59.490
<i>(Dana) Peace out, Hell's Kitchen!</i>

15:59.524 --> 16:00.558
<i>(Clemenza) Check it out.</i>

16:02.861 --> 16:04.462
You're goin' down!

16:04.496 --> 16:06.764
I'm gonna smoke Clemenza
out on the water right now.

16:06.798 --> 16:08.933
[Engines growling]

16:08.967 --> 16:11.135
Ah, Clemenza!

16:11.169 --> 16:14.572
(Clemenza) Once we break out into the
speed zone, it's just like, forget it.

16:14.606 --> 16:16.073
She's going this way, I'm going this way.

16:16.108 --> 16:17.541
She's jumping waves.

16:17.576 --> 16:18.876
I'm [Bleep] getting splashed
in the face with water.

16:18.910 --> 16:19.577
This is awesome.

16:19.611 --> 16:21.679
Come on, Dana! [Bleep]!

16:21.713 --> 16:23.080
Ha ha! That's it.

16:24.716 --> 16:26.984
(Dana) Hey, wait... where's Clemenza?

16:27.019 --> 16:28.552
Clemenza, are you there?

16:28.587 --> 16:30.254
Clemenza, it's over.

16:30.288 --> 16:31.255
You're gone.

16:31.289 --> 16:33.891
Bye, Clemenza!

16:33.925 --> 16:35.526
- Okay, and get this.
- Okay.

16:35.560 --> 16:36.594
Get this up here, yeah?

16:36.628 --> 16:38.295
Blah, punishment.

16:38.330 --> 16:39.597
Keep going.

16:39.631 --> 16:41.565
We are under the direction of James today.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.734
I'm pretty sure he's got a
pair of white gloves somewhere.

16:43.769 --> 16:45.636
I see more dust up there.

16:45.671 --> 16:47.738
<i>- Okay.
- Please make sure that's shiny.</i>

16:47.773 --> 16:50.174
Yeah, today would be a
good day to be on the lake.

16:53.011 --> 16:53.978
[Quacking]

16:54.012 --> 16:55.212
(Dana) Yeah!

16:55.247 --> 16:57.014
(Clemenza) What do we got here?

16:57.049 --> 16:59.984
(Dana) We jet ski up to
this private little cove.

17:00.018 --> 17:01.686
Whoa! There's nobody else around!

17:01.720 --> 17:03.654
Like, we have our own private beach.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.021
I'm starving.

17:05.057 --> 17:07.925
[Sexy music]

17:07.959 --> 17:08.925
(Clemenza) Wow!

17:08.960 --> 17:10.094
Yeah!

17:10.127 --> 17:11.796
(Clemenza) Whoa, this is pretty cool.

17:11.829 --> 17:12.863
Mmm.

17:12.897 --> 17:14.231
Yippie-ki-yay.

17:14.266 --> 17:15.633
Dana is in this bikini,

17:15.666 --> 17:17.435
and it's just this little bikini.

17:17.469 --> 17:20.003
I'm like, "mwah." [Speaking Italian]

17:20.038 --> 17:21.204
Dana, beautiful.

17:21.239 --> 17:22.973
- To our winning team.
- Yes, cheers.

17:23.008 --> 17:24.642
Beautiful day.

17:24.675 --> 17:25.843
Mm!

17:25.877 --> 17:27.178
<i>Definitely...</i>

17:27.212 --> 17:29.146
better than cleaning the dining room.

17:29.181 --> 17:30.147
[Laughs]

17:30.182 --> 17:31.482
[Sighs]

17:32.651 --> 17:34.485
All the linens need to be pressed.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.321
<i>Your mother is not here,</i>

17:37.355 --> 17:38.823
so you will be doing it.

17:38.857 --> 17:39.824
I don't iron.

17:39.858 --> 17:41.125
Oh, my God,

17:41.159 --> 17:43.127
Justin's gonna learn how to iron today.

17:43.161 --> 17:44.128
<i>All right.</i>

17:44.162 --> 17:45.329
Let's get to it.

17:45.363 --> 17:46.564
Nope.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.501
Oh, I'm definitely not ironing.

17:50.535 --> 17:51.669
For me, I feel it's a little degrading

17:51.703 --> 17:52.403
to have to sit there and iron.

17:52.437 --> 17:53.537
<i>Here.</i>

17:57.008 --> 17:58.309
<i>Here.</i>

18:00.979 --> 18:02.213
I just noticed something!

18:02.247 --> 18:03.414
Justin hasn't ironed?

18:03.448 --> 18:05.716
Justin...

18:05.751 --> 18:07.985
[Laughter]

18:08.019 --> 18:10.054
Justin, I've got something for you.

18:10.088 --> 18:11.989
Couple of my shirts.
Couple of Chef's jackets.

18:12.023 --> 18:14.091
<i>Seriously, no creases, no crinkles.</i>

18:14.126 --> 18:15.860
You know how Chef Ramsay is.

18:15.894 --> 18:17.795
I don't really even like
to iron my own shirts.

18:17.829 --> 18:19.230
You see how wrinkled these things are?

18:19.264 --> 18:20.998
Nevertheless have to
iron other men's shirts.

18:21.032 --> 18:22.733
What's the... I...

18:22.768 --> 18:24.401
<i>Use the other end, silly.</i>

18:24.436 --> 18:25.569
Man, this sucks.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.371
It really does suck.

18:27.405 --> 18:28.506
<i>(Dana) Hi, guys!</i>

18:28.540 --> 18:30.608
(All) Hi.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.409
Justin, you look good with the iron, man.

18:32.444 --> 18:34.245
You could do my dress next.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.479
<i>[Laughing] I'm just kidding.</i>

18:35.514 --> 18:36.914
[Laughter]

18:36.948 --> 18:38.682
Come on, Clemenza!

18:38.717 --> 18:40.251
<i>(Clemenza) I'm comin', honey.</i>

18:42.921 --> 18:45.322

may have been split up yesterday...

18:45.357 --> 18:46.891
Black jacket.

18:46.925 --> 18:48.526
(Announcer) Today, they
are all looking forward

18:48.560 --> 18:49.426
to their first dinner service

18:49.461 --> 18:50.928
in one kitchen as the black team.

18:50.962 --> 18:52.963
We can do this, guys. We gotta do this.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.431
Dude, I'm [Bleep] amped now.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.533
Morning.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.067
(Announcer) But Chef Ramsay...

18:57.102 --> 18:58.335
I need you all for 30 seconds, please.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.738
Come round. Let's go, come up to the bar.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.273
(Announcer) Has an important
piece of information for the group.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.774
Okay. I know something's coming.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.442
I know he's not bringing us all

19:05.477 --> 19:06.410
way up by the bar for no reason, you know?

19:06.444 --> 19:07.378
Big night tonight, right?

19:07.412 --> 19:08.412
(All) Yes, Chef!

19:08.446 --> 19:10.748
<i>And it's not just because
it's the first time</i>

19:10.782 --> 19:14.485
<i>you're working as a
dynamic team in one kitchen.</i>

19:14.519 --> 19:19.056
Tonight, you will be
competing against another team.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.393
Come on, dude. [Bleep] Spit it out.

19:22.427 --> 19:24.094
Who are we going up against?

19:24.129 --> 19:26.230
Take a look up there.

19:30.902 --> 19:33.037
Seriously, dude? Wow.

19:36.636 --> 19:40.906
(Announcer) Tonight, the final six will
be working together for the first time.

19:40.941 --> 19:44.543
But they won't be the only
Chefs cooking in Hell's Kitchen.

19:44.578 --> 19:47.480
You will be competing
against another team.

19:50.684 --> 19:52.651
Take a look up there.

19:52.686 --> 19:54.653
<i>All these individuals, like you,</i>

19:54.688 --> 19:56.822

19:56.857 --> 19:57.823
<i>These Chefs... </i>

19:57.858 --> 20:01.894
<i>not only earned their black jackets...</i>

20:01.928 --> 20:05.097
They were all runners-up.

<i>From Hell's Kitchen 8,</i>

20:09.503 --> 20:10.803
- That steak's cooked perfectly!
- Thank you, Chef!

20:10.837 --> 20:12.905
I chose the team that I wanted,

20:12.939 --> 20:14.807
and I thought they would help me win,

20:14.841 --> 20:16.208
and I'm gonna definitely
blackball you guys,

20:16.243 --> 20:17.910

20:20.280 --> 20:21.981
- Welcome back.
- Thank you very much.

20:22.015 --> 20:24.083
I remember Russell for
sure. What a [Bleep] ass.

20:24.117 --> 20:26.052
I don't care what station he's on tonight.

20:26.086 --> 20:27.753
I hope it burns down.

20:27.788 --> 20:29.922
I hope he goes down harder
than anybody on that team.

20:48.975 --> 20:50.209
(Dana) I don't like Jay.

20:50.243 --> 20:51.444
Why do you have blue hair?

20:51.478 --> 20:52.878
Do you think it looks good?

20:52.913 --> 20:54.980

22:38.919 --> 22:39.885
You're going home again.

22:39.920 --> 22:41.153
I've never looked forward to a service

22:41.188 --> 22:42.454
more than this one, let me tell you.

22:42.489 --> 22:43.756
- I'm ready.
- We're ready.

22:43.790 --> 22:44.857
I'm pumped.

22:44.891 --> 22:46.225
Good. Let's get cracking.

22:46.259 --> 22:47.526
Uh, good luck.

22:47.561 --> 22:49.762
(Bonnie) Tonight is redemption night.

22:49.796 --> 22:51.263
I want to win.

22:51.298 --> 22:54.233
If we lose, we're just
number twos all over again.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.734
And nobody wants to be the number two.

22:55.769 --> 22:57.136
I'm excited.

22:57.170 --> 22:58.404
Me too.

22:58.438 --> 23:00.739
This is the first time I've actually
been here that I'm excited to cook.

23:00.774 --> 23:01.974
[Bleep], yeah.

23:02.008 --> 23:03.809
I feel really good about my team.

23:03.843 --> 23:05.244
Our confidence is high.
Our theme is redemption.

23:05.278 --> 23:08.881
We're here to do work and pick up the "W."

23:08.915 --> 23:10.649
(Announcer) With an experienced lineup...

23:10.684 --> 23:12.251
I really just want to [Bleep] win.

23:12.285 --> 23:14.820
I would be shocked if the other team wins.

23:14.854 --> 23:15.854
Seriously.

23:15.889 --> 23:17.489
Let's do this.

23:17.524 --> 23:19.391
(Announcer) The runners-up
are not short on confidence.

23:19.426 --> 23:21.460
But over in the blue kitchen...

23:21.494 --> 23:23.462
Dude, I'm [Bleep] pumped.

23:23.496 --> 23:25.364
(Announcer) The current Chefs
are not ready to be counted out.

23:25.398 --> 23:26.232
<i>(Clemenza) I think we can take 'em.</i>

23:26.266 --> 23:27.399
Yeah.

23:27.434 --> 23:28.667
Matter of fact, I know we can take 'em.

23:28.702 --> 23:30.002
I agree.

23:30.036 --> 23:31.937
Matter of fact, let's
just [Bleep] take 'em.

23:31.972 --> 23:33.239
You know what I'm [Bleep] sayin', baby?

23:33.273 --> 23:34.406
Let's take all these bitches right now.

23:34.441 --> 23:35.140
Yeah, really.

23:35.175 --> 23:36.775
I'm not intimidated at all.

23:36.810 --> 23:39.278
You've had your time here.
This is our house now.

23:39.312 --> 23:41.247
Welcome. We'll show you how it's done.

23:41.281 --> 23:42.948
I never wanted to win so bad in my life.

23:42.983 --> 23:44.216
Honestly, I'm not even kidding.

23:44.251 --> 23:45.284
[Chuckles] Yep.

23:45.318 --> 23:46.752
- All right, James.
- Yes, Chef?

23:46.786 --> 23:47.987
- Let's go.
- Yes, Chef.

23:48.021 --> 23:49.321
Open Hell's Kitchen.

24:02.502 --> 24:05.571
(Announcer) Tonight, it's a
dinner service unlike any other

24:05.605 --> 24:07.306
as some of the most talented Chefs

24:07.340 --> 24:08.974
<i>in Hell's Kitchen history are back,</i>

24:09.009 --> 24:10.242
looking for redemption.

24:10.277 --> 24:11.543
Let's go.

24:11.578 --> 24:13.178
(Announcer) They take
on the current Chefs,

24:13.213 --> 24:14.513
who want to prove to Chef Ramsay

24:14.547 --> 24:17.449
<i>that they are just as good
as Hell's Kitchen's best.</i>

24:17.484 --> 24:18.884
Let's kick some runner-up ass.

24:18.918 --> 24:19.785
(All) One, two, three.

24:19.819 --> 24:21.020
Black team!

24:21.054 --> 24:22.888
Order in, Chef. Let's go.

24:22.922 --> 24:24.256
<i>Okay, returning Chefs.</i>

24:24.291 --> 24:25.858
On order, four couples, table 30.

24:25.892 --> 24:26.992
Two scallops, two Caesar salad.

24:27.027 --> 24:28.027
(All) Yes, Chef!

24:28.061 --> 24:29.128
Five to the window!

24:29.162 --> 24:30.195
Five in the window.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.664
<i>Virginia...</i>

24:31.698 --> 24:33.232
you guys are talking
with the scallop, right?

24:33.266 --> 24:34.199
You guys are all set?

24:34.234 --> 24:35.801
Got it.

24:35.835 --> 24:38.003
(Kevin) You know, it's that old
feeling that comes back again.

24:38.038 --> 24:39.271
You just kind of start to get into sync.

24:39.306 --> 24:41.273
"All right, you're here,
you're here, you're there.

24:41.308 --> 24:42.708
You're doing this, you
got that, you got this,

24:42.742 --> 24:43.676
you got that, y'all got this. Check this."

24:43.710 --> 24:44.376
You going up now? I can go up.

24:44.411 --> 24:45.311
<i>Two scallops! Thank you.</i>

24:45.345 --> 24:46.445
Got the garnish?

24:46.479 --> 24:47.546
It's just like riding a bike.

24:47.580 --> 24:48.681
You just fell off.

24:48.715 --> 24:50.282
Now you're back on, ready to go.

24:53.153 --> 24:54.887
Lovely scallops! Beautiful scallops.

24:54.921 --> 24:55.888
Thank you, Chef.

24:55.922 --> 24:57.656
Service, please.

24:57.691 --> 25:00.259
(Jay) Getting a compliment from
Chef Ramsay for anything is amazing.

25:00.293 --> 25:02.828
I mean, it feels great. I feel phenomenal.

25:02.862 --> 25:03.829
Who done these?

25:03.863 --> 25:04.897
These guys, Chef.

25:04.931 --> 25:06.198
Beautiful. Let's go.

25:06.232 --> 25:07.566
<i>- All right.
- Service, please.</i>

25:07.600 --> 25:08.701
Returning Chefs, keep
that going like that.

25:08.735 --> 25:10.369
Yes? I'm gonna be over the moon.

25:10.403 --> 25:11.670
<i>Let's go, yeah?</i>

25:11.705 --> 25:13.138
(Announcer) The returning Chefs

25:13.173 --> 25:14.306
have delivered perfection to Chef Ramsay.

25:14.341 --> 25:16.041
And now, over in the blue kitchen...

25:16.076 --> 25:17.743
On order... three couples, table 61.

25:17.777 --> 25:19.211
- Three Caesar salad...
- Yes, Chef!

25:19.245 --> 25:21.180
Three Caesar working right now!

25:21.214 --> 25:22.848
(Announcer) He's looking
for Robyn on cold appetizers

25:22.882 --> 25:24.350
to deliver more of the same.

25:24.384 --> 25:25.718
90 seconds out.

25:25.752 --> 25:27.219
Heard 90 seconds!

25:27.253 --> 25:29.321
I am on cold apps,
working next to Christina.

25:29.356 --> 25:31.390
This is gonna be an easy service.

25:31.424 --> 25:34.093
The real black team is gonna
[Bleep] whip their asses.

25:36.196 --> 25:37.930
Robyn!

25:37.964 --> 25:39.164
<i>Yes, Chef?</i>

25:39.199 --> 25:41.300
I want more salad
dressing on here... look.

25:41.334 --> 25:42.501
- It's dry.
- Okay, Chef.

25:42.535 --> 25:43.369
Yeah, it's dry. Let's go.

25:43.403 --> 25:44.570
More dressing.

25:44.604 --> 25:46.372
[Bleep] Hell.

25:46.406 --> 25:48.307
<i>Come on, Robyn! I do not expect</i>

25:48.341 --> 25:50.376
a Caesar salad to be
redone, not at this stage.

25:50.410 --> 25:53.412
Robyn, all you had to do
was put dressing on leaves.

25:53.446 --> 25:55.247
That's it, that's all you had to do.

25:55.281 --> 25:58.417
So now we're already off to a bad start.

25:58.451 --> 25:59.718
<i>Caesar salad, Chef.</i>

25:59.753 --> 26:02.187
<i>Extra dressed. Not too wet.</i>

26:03.423 --> 26:05.190
Finally.

26:05.225 --> 26:08.260
(Announcer) Robyn has managed to
deliver acceptable Caesar salads.

26:08.294 --> 26:09.395
But in the red kitchen,

26:09.429 --> 26:10.929
the runners-up...

26:10.964 --> 26:12.998
Chef, first scallop, second
one 20 seconds behind.

26:13.032 --> 26:14.967
Nice color. Good.

26:15.001 --> 26:17.002
(Announcer) Are doing way
better than acceptable.

26:17.036 --> 26:20.939
I've never seen food this
immaculate leave the red kitchen.

26:20.974 --> 26:23.275
(Announcer) And have served more
than half of their appetizers.

26:23.309 --> 26:24.743
It's really good.

26:24.778 --> 26:26.278
(Announcer) Now, over
in the blue kitchen...

26:26.312 --> 26:28.213
Two scallops, one Caesar salad away!

26:28.248 --> 26:30.315
(Announcer) Robyn has
enlisted the help of Clemenza.

26:30.350 --> 26:32.117
Rob, how many more spaghetti we got?

26:32.152 --> 26:33.485
<i>- One more?
- Yes!</i>

26:33.520 --> 26:35.487
(Announcer) Who is determined
to make up for lost time.

26:35.522 --> 26:36.555
Why is he doing spaghetti?

26:36.589 --> 26:37.856
We don't [Bleep] need it.

26:37.891 --> 26:39.291
(Announcer) Perhaps a
little too determined.

26:39.325 --> 26:41.193
- What are you doing?
- Spaghetti of lobster.

26:41.227 --> 26:43.896
Look at me! We haven't even got it on!

26:43.930 --> 26:46.432
(Clemenza) I'm looking at
Robyn like, "what the [Bleep]?"

26:46.466 --> 26:47.800
Big man out of control!

26:47.834 --> 26:49.768
<i>Come here! It's not even on!</i>

26:49.803 --> 26:51.270
She's putting the spaghetti down.

26:51.304 --> 26:53.605
<i>Now she's taking the pan.</i>

26:53.640 --> 26:55.007
It's not on!

26:55.041 --> 26:57.509
I would not want to be
over there right now.

26:57.544 --> 26:59.244
How come both of you produced something

26:59.279 --> 27:00.212
that's not on the [Bleep] order?

27:00.246 --> 27:02.214
Are you kidding me?

27:02.248 --> 27:03.615
What an embarrassment.

27:03.650 --> 27:05.217
That is embarrassing.

27:05.251 --> 27:08.020
That just tells me that both
of you are out of control!

27:08.054 --> 27:09.721
- No, Chef.
- So if you are in control,

27:09.756 --> 27:11.790
then why are you cooking
food we don't need?

27:11.825 --> 27:13.692
- Answer me that one, then.
- No answer, Chef.

27:13.726 --> 27:15.327
Both of you are out of control!

27:15.361 --> 27:17.896
<i>You and you, do you wanna go?</i>

27:17.931 --> 27:19.064
[Bleep], dude!

27:19.098 --> 27:21.433
Focus!

27:26.011 --> 27:28.045
(Announcer) An hour into dinner service...

27:28.079 --> 27:30.047
Two scallops. Let's go.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.982
(Announcer) Both teams are
steadily sending out appetizers.

27:32.017 --> 27:33.250
Service, please.

27:33.285 --> 27:34.351
(Announcer) And in the blue kitchen,

27:34.386 --> 27:36.820
our current Chefs are
looking to get ahead.

27:36.855 --> 27:38.922
- What are you doing?
- Spaghetti of lobster.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.524
Look at me! We haven't even got it on!

27:40.558 --> 27:41.992
(Announcer) Unfortunately,

27:42.027 --> 27:44.161
it's with food that hasn't been ordered.

27:44.195 --> 27:45.829
How come both of you produced something

27:45.864 --> 27:48.732
that's not on [Bleep] order!

27:48.767 --> 27:50.834
"Get over." I said, "what do you need?"

27:50.869 --> 27:52.336
Robyn said, "make this."
Done, and I started making it.

27:52.370 --> 27:53.604
Now I'm catching [Bleep] for it.

27:53.638 --> 27:56.106
<i>Are you feeling like a bit of
a spare [Bleep] at a wedding?</i>

27:56.141 --> 27:57.141
No, Chef.

27:57.175 --> 27:58.275
'Cause you look like one!

27:58.310 --> 27:59.710
Get rid of it.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.578
Gee, thanks. Thank you, Robyn.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.380
<i>You had the appetizer rolling out.</i>

28:03.415 --> 28:04.415
Now we're hitting the entrees. Let's go.

28:04.449 --> 28:05.816
(All) Yes, Chef.

28:05.850 --> 28:06.817
Away now... two COD, two New York strip.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.185
(All) Yes, Chef!

28:08.219 --> 28:09.687
Three minutes! I need
garnish in the window!

28:09.721 --> 28:11.188
Yes!

28:11.222 --> 28:13.290
(Announcer) While Barbie
gets the team back on track...

28:13.325 --> 28:14.558
Where do you need help out, guys?

28:14.592 --> 28:15.959
Don't touch anything!

28:15.994 --> 28:17.428
(Announcer) Over in the red kitchen...

28:17.462 --> 28:18.595
Chef, hot.

28:18.630 --> 28:21.098
(Announcer) The returning Chefs
have finished their appetizers.

28:21.132 --> 28:23.300
My first bite melted in my mouth.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.602
(Announcer) And are moving on to entrees.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.004
Two Wellington, two COD, two sea bass!

28:27.038 --> 28:28.205
(All) Yes, Chef!

28:28.239 --> 28:29.440
Let's go.

28:29.474 --> 28:30.741
(Announcer) Now, it's up to season 7

28:30.775 --> 28:33.744
runner-up Jay on fish
to keep up the momentum.

28:33.778 --> 28:34.945
(Jay) Behind you, behind you.

28:34.979 --> 28:36.146
Right behind you.

28:36.181 --> 28:37.448
Two bass.

28:40.885 --> 28:42.386
<i>(Kevin) That's peppered beyond belief.</i>

28:42.420 --> 28:45.289
Jay!

28:45.323 --> 28:46.857
I got two bass on the same table.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.958
I got one cooked beautifully

28:47.992 --> 28:49.827
and one that's caked in black pepper.

28:49.861 --> 28:50.961
- Yes, Chef.
- Yes.

28:50.995 --> 28:52.763
Jay was sweatin' bullets.

28:52.797 --> 28:54.798
I mean, blue [Bleep] running
all down the side of his face.

28:54.833 --> 28:56.734
[Laughing] He was
sweatin', so it was like,

28:56.768 --> 28:58.302
all right, before we sink,
this would be a good idea

28:58.336 --> 29:00.104
to jump over there and just help out.

29:00.138 --> 29:01.472
Come on, guys. I'm draggin' a bass!

29:01.506 --> 29:03.941
Comin' right now, Chef!

29:03.975 --> 29:05.709
I'm ready on the garnishes.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.378
<i>I got it right now! I got it, I got it!</i>

29:07.412 --> 29:08.879
Hot behind! Hot behind!

29:10.515 --> 29:12.049
Kevin...

29:12.083 --> 29:13.784
- Perfect.
- Yes, Chef!

29:13.818 --> 29:16.553
(Announcer) Kevin has managed
to keep the fish station afloat.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.255
<i>- Thank you.
- (Gordon) Service.</i>

29:18.289 --> 29:19.523
(Announcer) But over in the blue kitchen,

29:19.557 --> 29:20.858
thanks to Barbie...

29:20.892 --> 29:23.093
Two COD, two welli, two bass! Walking!

29:23.128 --> 29:25.829
(Announcer) The current Chefs are
ready with their first entrees.

29:25.864 --> 29:27.231
Service please.

29:27.265 --> 29:29.800
(Announcer) And are giving the
runners-up a run for their money.

29:29.834 --> 29:30.968
Beautifully cooked, Barbie.

29:31.002 --> 29:32.002
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

29:32.036 --> 29:33.370
Hell, yeah!

29:33.405 --> 29:35.305
I'm not letting the
runners-up intimidate me.

29:35.340 --> 29:37.474
Right now, it's neck-and-neck!

29:37.509 --> 29:38.742
<i>Yes, Chef! Keep it going.</i>

29:38.777 --> 29:39.810
(All) Yes, Chef!

29:39.844 --> 29:41.211
<i>Last order of appetizers.</i>

29:41.246 --> 29:42.479
<i>Two scallops, three lobster spaghetti.</i>

29:42.514 --> 29:45.182
<i>After that, two sea
bass, two New York strip.</i>

29:45.216 --> 29:46.550
How long? Five minutes, Chef.

29:46.584 --> 29:47.684
Nine, nine!

29:47.719 --> 29:48.719
Nine!

29:48.753 --> 29:50.354
- What?
- She just dropped it.

29:50.388 --> 29:51.488
<i>I can't do ten minutes every table.</i>

29:51.523 --> 29:52.156
- Gotta drive it, yes?
- Yes, Chef.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.357
Let's go, you.

29:53.391 --> 29:55.025
After that, three COD, one Wellington.

29:55.059 --> 29:56.794
<i>- Three COD, one Wellington!
- How long?</i>

29:56.828 --> 29:58.529
<i>- Eight minutes, Chef.
- Eight minutes for COD?</i>

29:58.563 --> 30:00.531
Fish cooks quick.

30:00.565 --> 30:02.232
Are you stupid or what?

30:02.267 --> 30:03.500
- Dana!
- Yes, Chef?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.969
Ask for [Bleep] help!

30:06.004 --> 30:07.704
He's doing nothing. She's doing nothing.

30:07.739 --> 30:09.039
<i>And you're sinking.</i>

30:09.073 --> 30:10.607
Stand here and shout for help!

30:10.642 --> 30:11.809
Yes, Chef!

30:11.843 --> 30:13.510
I don't trust Clemenza and Robyn.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.980
They don't have the skills or the
finesse that the rest of us have.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.149
So I don't want them on my station.

30:19.184 --> 30:20.951
<i>What are you doing? Can you just...</i>

30:20.985 --> 30:22.653
Two orders of scallops
going in two minutes.

30:22.687 --> 30:24.354
Fine, Clemenza, you cook the scallops.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.389
I'll cook my fish.

30:25.423 --> 30:27.157
Do not [Bleep] this up.

30:27.192 --> 30:29.726
<i>(Justin) Need those
scallops right away, guys.</i>

30:31.129 --> 30:32.262
Ah, come on!

30:34.499 --> 30:36.200
I know that Clemenza can't cook scallops.

30:36.234 --> 30:37.301
Scallops getting ready to walk!

30:37.335 --> 30:38.569
Got nice color on those, right?

30:38.603 --> 30:40.537
Yeah. Don't worry.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.506
(Justin) I don't even know why
he would attempt to help someone

30:42.540 --> 30:43.540
by cooking something he can't do.

30:43.575 --> 30:44.541
Come on.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.243
Scallops!

30:46.277 --> 30:47.911
Scallops walkin'!

30:47.946 --> 30:50.047
Comin' in.

30:54.719 --> 30:55.953
[Bleep]

30:55.987 --> 30:58.989
All of you, come here!

30:59.023 --> 30:59.990
Hurry up! Mm.

31:00.024 --> 31:00.991
I knew it!

31:01.025 --> 31:02.426
This is just... look!

31:02.460 --> 31:03.961
Look, there we are.

31:03.995 --> 31:05.762
She can't ask for [Bleep] help.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.798
He burns the scallops. Look at that.

31:07.832 --> 31:09.867
(Dana) You're supposed to
be coming over to help me,

31:09.901 --> 31:11.401
not [Bleep] sink me!

31:11.436 --> 31:13.303
Come on! Yes, Chef!

31:13.338 --> 31:15.205
<i>And if you're gonna have somebody</i>

31:15.240 --> 31:16.206
on your station, you've
got to control them!

31:16.241 --> 31:17.207
Yes, Chef!

31:17.242 --> 31:18.942
So wake up!

31:20.478 --> 31:22.779
Hey, Robyn, I need two scallops.

31:22.814 --> 31:25.782
(Announcer) While Dana tries her
luck with Robyn on the scallops...

31:25.817 --> 31:27.117
Two orders of scallops now!

31:27.151 --> 31:28.318
Heard!

31:28.353 --> 31:30.187
(Announcer) Over in the red kitchen...

31:30.221 --> 31:31.421
Okay, going up, two
Wellington, two COD, yes?

31:31.456 --> 31:32.556
Yeah, let's go.

31:32.590 --> 31:33.824
Two Wellington garnishes up,

31:33.858 --> 31:34.625
two COD garnishes up.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.193
Coming behind, behind.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.961
(Announcer) The returning Chefs,

31:37.996 --> 31:40.063
who have never been in the
kitchen together before tonight,

31:40.098 --> 31:41.665
have quickly bonded.

31:41.699 --> 31:42.799
- Paula!
- Yes?

31:42.834 --> 31:44.034
<i>They're perfectly cooked.</i>

31:44.068 --> 31:45.068
Thank you, Chef.

31:45.103 --> 31:46.136
Whoo-hoo!

31:46.170 --> 31:47.604
(Announcer) But one Chef...

31:47.639 --> 31:49.239
Bonnie, need a spoon, sweetheart?

31:49.274 --> 31:50.841
(Announcer) Isn't exactly making friends.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.609
You're gonna be like
the [Bleep] douche bag,

31:52.644 --> 31:54.278
calling all the girls sweetheart.

31:54.312 --> 31:57.014
I'm from the South so
I call women sweetheart.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.482
Do you need another
sizzle platter, sweetheart?

31:58.516 --> 31:59.683
Er, uh, Paula.

31:59.717 --> 32:00.851
Yeah. See how I held that back?

32:00.885 --> 32:02.252
I'm just a gentleman.

32:02.287 --> 32:03.854
If you don't like it...

32:03.888 --> 32:05.489
Boom!

32:05.523 --> 32:07.124
You love me anyways.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.726
(Announcer) Confident in
themselves and their cooking, ves

32:09.761 --> 32:12.462
the runners-up continue to
pump out consistent entrees.

32:12.497 --> 32:13.864
Hot on your right.

32:13.898 --> 32:15.098
(Announcer) Over in the blue kitchen,

32:15.133 --> 32:17.968
the current Chefs are
sending out entrees as well.

32:18.002 --> 32:19.369
Service, please.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.138
(Announcer) And Chef Ramsay is eager

32:21.172 --> 32:22.973
to finish the last table of appetizers.

32:23.007 --> 32:25.042
I'm dragging two scallops,
three spaghetti... how long?

32:25.076 --> 32:26.376
I got four minutes on the pasta, Chef.

32:27.512 --> 32:29.446
<i>Who seasoned the scallops?</i>

32:29.480 --> 32:31.048
Oh, I don't know where these came from.

32:31.082 --> 32:33.016
<i>- I don't know.
- Come here.</i>

32:33.051 --> 32:35.986
<i>We season scallops as they go in the pan.</i>

32:36.020 --> 32:37.454
They've sat there, screwed.

32:37.488 --> 32:39.189
<i>When you season like that, they go dry.</i>

32:39.223 --> 32:40.958
Then they go overcooked.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.793
Well, I didn't put them
there, that's why...

32:42.827 --> 32:43.760
that's why I said, "who seasoned them?"

32:43.795 --> 32:44.828
Who seasoned the scallops?

32:47.332 --> 32:49.866
(Robyn) I seasoned those scallops
right there, Chef, for her.

32:49.901 --> 32:52.035
And you're four minutes away.

32:52.070 --> 32:53.904
I seasoned two orders of scallops

32:53.938 --> 32:55.572
and put 'em in the pan for Dana.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.240
And I didn't finish them,

32:57.275 --> 32:59.309
'cause Dana likes to
finish her own scallops.

32:59.344 --> 33:01.044
So... that's my fault?

33:01.079 --> 33:02.879
<i>I wanna know now,</i>

33:02.914 --> 33:04.281
between you two muppets,

33:04.315 --> 33:05.515
<i>what the [Bleep] are you doing,</i>

33:05.550 --> 33:06.583
<i>and I'll stop it.</i>

33:06.618 --> 33:07.651
I seasoned those scal...

33:07.685 --> 33:09.720
Shout at me again...

33:09.754 --> 33:11.154
- I will lift you up...
- Yes.

33:11.189 --> 33:12.122
- And throw you in that...
- I know.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.523
And you think it's funny.

33:13.558 --> 33:15.359
I don't, Chef, think it's funny.

33:15.393 --> 33:17.127
<i>I'm just trying to help out,</i>

33:17.161 --> 33:18.729
<i>but there's too many people right now.</i>

33:18.763 --> 33:19.930
<i>You're right... there are
far too many people, Robyn.</i>

33:19.964 --> 33:22.332
[Bleep]!

33:22.367 --> 33:23.900
See ya later, Robyn.

33:24.902 --> 33:27.137
Dana... come here!

33:27.171 --> 33:28.672
Whoo! What?

33:28.706 --> 33:29.673
Take those out of the oven.

33:29.707 --> 33:32.909
No!

33:36.271 --> 33:37.604
(Announcer) It's nearly two hours

33:37.639 --> 33:38.806
into dinner service,

33:38.840 --> 33:40.808
and with Dana falling behind on fish...

33:40.842 --> 33:42.943
Robyn, I need two scallops.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.012
(Announcer) She has
enlisted the help of Robyn...

33:45.046 --> 33:46.513
Who seasoned the scallops?

33:46.548 --> 33:49.116
(Announcer) Unfortunately, Robyn
has set her back even further.

33:49.150 --> 33:51.218
When you season like that, they go dry,

33:51.252 --> 33:53.253
then they go overcooked.

33:53.288 --> 33:55.989
(Announcer) But Chef Ramsay feels
the responsibility lies with...

33:56.024 --> 33:57.758
Dana, come here!

34:01.196 --> 34:02.563
You're sinking.

34:02.597 --> 34:04.631
If anybody touches
anything on your station,

34:04.666 --> 34:05.999
you've got to command it.

34:06.034 --> 34:07.601
- Yes, Chef.
- Now, find a voice...

34:07.635 --> 34:09.002
- Yes, Chef.
- And get a grip, Dana.

34:09.036 --> 34:10.036
Yes, Chef.

34:12.373 --> 34:13.806
Chef Ramsay's right.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.409
If they're not helping me,

34:15.443 --> 34:16.677
then I need to kick
them off of my station.

34:16.710 --> 34:18.712
I need two more scallops now.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.414
- I would like to cook them.
- That's fine.

34:20.447 --> 34:21.882
Spaghetti, scallops?

34:21.916 --> 34:23.117
How long on the scallop?

34:23.150 --> 34:24.284
Two minutes!

34:24.319 --> 34:26.018
I got it. It's 2 1/2 minutes.

34:26.054 --> 34:27.487
Please.

34:27.522 --> 34:30.090
I can absolutely do
this station better alone

34:30.125 --> 34:31.992
than with anybody else trying to help me.

34:33.261 --> 34:34.527
Scallops walking!

34:37.899 --> 34:39.199
Service, please.

34:39.234 --> 34:40.801
(Announcer) Dana has managed to get

34:40.835 --> 34:42.168
the fish station back on track.

34:42.203 --> 34:43.737
Two COD, two New York strip.

34:43.772 --> 34:44.670
How long do you need on the New York?

34:44.706 --> 34:45.606
I'm ready on the COD.

34:45.639 --> 34:46.974
(Announcer) And the bluechen

34:47.007 --> 34:48.475
is pushing out their final entrees.

34:48.510 --> 34:50.010
Go, he said. Coming up behind.

34:50.043 --> 34:51.678
Walking with COD, right now.

34:51.713 --> 34:53.347
(Announcer) And both teams...

34:53.380 --> 34:54.748
We're down to the last ticket, let's go.

34:54.783 --> 34:56.150
Hot, hot behind.

34:56.184 --> 34:57.951
(Announcer) Complete
a solid dinner service.

34:57.986 --> 34:58.952
Well done, guys.

34:58.987 --> 35:01.488
<i>Great teamwork.</i>

35:04.526 --> 35:05.492
Tonight...

35:05.527 --> 35:06.860
<i>for the first time,</i>

35:06.895 --> 35:08.195
<i>not only did you cook together,</i>

35:08.229 --> 35:10.497
but you were up against the very best.

35:10.532 --> 35:12.633
<i>The winning team tonight...</i>

35:12.667 --> 35:14.935
is...

35:14.969 --> 35:16.303
our returning runners-up.

35:16.337 --> 35:18.138
Great job well done.

35:18.173 --> 35:19.206
Whoo!

35:19.240 --> 35:20.874
Yay!

35:20.909 --> 35:22.609
It feels good to win.

35:22.644 --> 35:24.178
<i>- Thank you, Chef.
- All of you,</i>

35:24.212 --> 35:25.212
<i>- a big thank you.
- Good luck, guys.</i>

35:25.246 --> 35:27.080
[Overlapping farewells]

35:27.115 --> 35:28.715
I did not want to lose tonight.

35:28.750 --> 35:29.716
Not happy.

35:29.751 --> 35:31.051
Not [Bleep] happy.

35:31.085 --> 35:32.186
Thank you, guys.

35:32.220 --> 35:33.720
Whoo! Whoo hoo!

35:33.755 --> 35:35.255
Whoo hoo! [Laughter]

35:35.290 --> 35:37.191
Considering this was your first time

35:37.225 --> 35:39.927
<i>working together as one team,</i>

35:39.961 --> 35:41.662
<i>not bad.</i>

35:41.696 --> 35:43.063
The bad news...

35:43.097 --> 35:45.732
<i>when you make such careless mistakes,</i>

35:45.767 --> 35:47.501
and it was just so frustrating,

35:47.535 --> 35:49.303
'cause you could have
been right with them.

35:49.337 --> 35:51.772
<i>Get upstairs and come to a decision</i>

35:51.806 --> 35:55.776
<i>on which two of you should
be leaving Hell's Kitchen.</i>

35:55.810 --> 35:57.678
- Got it?
- (All) Yes, Chef.

35:57.712 --> 35:59.279
[Bleep] Off.

35:59.314 --> 36:00.681
There's no way I'm gonna go up tonight.

36:00.715 --> 36:03.317
Everything was fine until
everyone starts coming over

36:03.351 --> 36:05.285
and [Bleep] up on my station.

36:08.356 --> 36:09.857
[Sighs]

36:09.891 --> 36:11.658
Can I just say something about my station?

36:11.693 --> 36:12.159
<i>Chef wanted me to ask for help.</i>

36:12.193 --> 36:13.427
Okay, fine.

36:13.461 --> 36:14.595
So I'll give the scallops to somebody.

36:14.629 --> 36:15.729
One, two...

36:15.763 --> 36:17.331
I didn't cook any scallops.

36:17.365 --> 36:18.499
I put 'em in the pan, that was it!

36:18.533 --> 36:19.766
But you walked away from it, then,

36:19.801 --> 36:20.968
<i>like, that's...</i>

36:21.002 --> 36:22.703
Like it's... she's saying,
"I need the scallops."

36:22.737 --> 36:23.570
<i>Clemenza cooked the first ones.</i>

36:23.605 --> 36:24.538
They were raw, correct?

36:24.572 --> 36:26.139
- Dana...
- Yeah?

36:26.174 --> 36:27.741
It's the second time on fish.

36:27.775 --> 36:30.344
To blame someone that's
helping her on her station,

36:30.378 --> 36:33.247
I think that's just an error in judgment.

36:33.281 --> 36:35.349
I'm sorry, Clemenza, my vote is for you,

36:35.383 --> 36:36.617
<i>and it's not personal,
it's just based on the fact</i>

36:36.651 --> 36:39.052
<i>that... when you came over to help me,</i>

36:39.087 --> 36:40.087
I needed your help with the scallops.

36:40.121 --> 36:40.888
They went up raw.

36:40.922 --> 36:42.155
Yeah.

36:42.190 --> 36:43.590
Yeah, I put up a [Bleep]-up scallop.

36:43.625 --> 36:44.758
But I worked my ass off.

36:44.792 --> 36:46.693
Dana should be going home tonight,

36:46.728 --> 36:48.295
'cause the fish station
was [Bleep] slow as [Bleep].

36:48.329 --> 36:49.763
She should be the one
that should be up there.

36:49.797 --> 36:51.064
Not [Bleep] me.

36:53.368 --> 36:55.002
I'm gonna vote for Robyn,

36:55.036 --> 36:56.870
<i>because she doesn't
finish what she starts.</i>

36:56.905 --> 36:58.572
You know what, Barbie? I
finish everything I start,

36:58.606 --> 36:59.806
so I don't even wanna hear it.

36:59.841 --> 37:01.375
Except for scallops.

37:01.409 --> 37:03.110
Because it's her station!

37:03.144 --> 37:05.312
Oh, my... and then you're
not accountable for [Bleep]!

37:05.346 --> 37:07.214
You're just floating station to station,

37:07.248 --> 37:08.815
just starting [Bleep]!

37:08.850 --> 37:10.651
You know what, don't talk
to me like that, honey!

37:10.685 --> 37:11.685
<i>Okay, fine. Don't talk to me like that.</i>

37:11.719 --> 37:13.053
I can't handle this [Bleep] anymore.

37:13.087 --> 37:15.255
I don't know the word that
comes after frustration,

37:15.290 --> 37:17.391
but that's pretty much where
I'm at with Robyn right now.

37:17.425 --> 37:19.560
You don't want me here.

37:19.594 --> 37:20.661
You don't want me here.

37:20.695 --> 37:21.862
Rea... oh. Ohh!

37:21.896 --> 37:23.530
<i>I know you don't want me here.</i>

37:23.565 --> 37:24.798
<i>Stop it. You don't want me here.</i>

37:24.832 --> 37:25.866
Robyn's definitely my first vote.

37:25.900 --> 37:26.967
I'll be the first one to say that.

37:27.001 --> 37:28.435
Okay. Fine. Put me up there.

37:28.469 --> 37:30.704
I didn't [Bleep] up
tonight. Y'all did, not me.

37:30.738 --> 37:33.574
I feel like Chef Ramsay is
definitely gonna agree with me.

37:33.608 --> 37:34.608
Megan.

37:44.152 --> 37:45.686
[Sighs]

37:45.720 --> 37:47.187
Barbie.

37:47.221 --> 37:48.288
Yes, Chef?

37:48.323 --> 37:50.057
First nominee and why, please.

37:50.091 --> 37:51.191
The first nominee of
the black team was Robyn.

37:51.225 --> 37:52.225
Robyn?

37:52.260 --> 37:53.627
<i>- Yes, Chef.
- Why?</i>

37:53.661 --> 37:55.095
She was all over the place,

37:55.129 --> 37:56.997
and accomplishing nothing.

37:57.031 --> 37:58.298
No.

37:58.333 --> 37:59.733
Second nominee. Barbie.

37:59.767 --> 38:01.969
The team's second nominee was...

38:10.400 --> 38:13.235
(Announcer) The Chefs successfully
completed their first dinner service

38:13.269 --> 38:14.670
as the black team,

38:14.704 --> 38:16.472
but were unable to defeat the returning

38:16.506 --> 38:17.940
<i>Hell's Kitchen runner's up.</i>

38:17.974 --> 38:21.443
And they must give Chef
Ramsay their two nominees.

38:21.478 --> 38:22.478
The first nominee was...

38:22.512 --> 38:24.346
Robyn.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.781
Second nominee.

38:25.815 --> 38:26.982
The team's second nominee was...

38:29.552 --> 38:30.719
Clemenza, Chef.

38:33.223 --> 38:35.457
Clemenza?

38:35.492 --> 38:38.360
<i>The team felt like Clemenza was
responsible for Dana's scallops.</i>

38:39.529 --> 38:41.430
[Sighs] Robyn, Clemenza,

38:41.464 --> 38:42.764
<i>step forward, please. Let's go.</i>

38:42.799 --> 38:44.967
<i>Move, Clemenza.</i>

38:47.537 --> 38:49.171
- Robyn...
- Yes, Chef?

38:49.205 --> 38:51.206
Tell me why you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

38:51.241 --> 38:53.175
I deserve this black
jacket. I deserve to be here.

38:53.209 --> 38:55.811
<i>The first thing I said
since day one is "teamwork."</i>

38:55.845 --> 38:57.279
<i>Teamwork, teamwork, teamwork.</i>

38:57.313 --> 38:58.780
<i>There's no "I" in team.</i>

38:58.815 --> 39:00.649
<i>I don't know, Chef.</i>

39:00.683 --> 39:02.484
I tried to help out tonight with meat.

39:02.519 --> 39:03.852
<i>I felt like I had to throw elbows,</i>

39:03.887 --> 39:05.154
I felt like I was in a
basketball game, trying to...

39:05.188 --> 39:06.855
Trying to get in there, try to help out.

39:06.890 --> 39:08.090
So who should be up there
in place of you, then?

39:08.124 --> 39:09.658
I feel like Dana didn't communicate

39:09.692 --> 39:11.393
<i>and asked for help when she needed it.</i>

39:11.427 --> 39:13.328
No, but I felt like I had
a handle on my station.

39:13.363 --> 39:14.630
I was fine.

39:14.664 --> 39:16.064
<i>Them being there wasn't helping me.</i>

39:16.099 --> 39:17.166
It was making it worse.

39:19.068 --> 39:21.036
<i>Clemenza, is your time done?</i>

39:21.070 --> 39:22.070
No, Chef!

39:22.105 --> 39:23.438
<i>My time is not done.</i>

39:23.473 --> 39:24.740
<i>I am not ready to go home.</i>

39:24.774 --> 39:28.744
I am 110% ready to go and do
anything you need to be done.

39:28.778 --> 39:30.445
How many times have you
been up here, Clemenza?

39:30.480 --> 39:31.747
<i>- Too many, Chef.
- Yeah, how many?</i>

39:31.781 --> 39:32.948
Three, four.

39:32.982 --> 39:34.383
I think tonight...

39:34.417 --> 39:35.817
Whew.

39:35.852 --> 39:39.254
It's your sixth time.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.590
Okay, this is tough.

39:41.624 --> 39:46.328
My decision is...

39:46.362 --> 39:52.234
Clemenza.

39:52.268 --> 39:54.303
Back in line.

39:54.337 --> 39:56.471
[Exhales]

39:56.506 --> 39:57.472
Robyn.

39:57.507 --> 39:58.774
<i>- Yes, Chef.
- The passion...</i>

39:58.808 --> 40:00.108
<i>the hunger's there.</i>

40:00.143 --> 40:02.344
But you're not ready right now

40:02.378 --> 40:03.679
to be Head Chef in Vegas.

40:03.713 --> 40:05.080
- I respect you.
- Thank you.

40:05.114 --> 40:06.615
Give me your jacket.

40:06.649 --> 40:07.883
- Thank you, Chef, for everything.
- Thank you.

40:07.917 --> 40:08.684
<i>Keep going, will you?</i>

40:08.718 --> 40:10.185
<i>Of course.</i>

40:13.523 --> 40:17.059
<i>I thought that I was gonna be the
season 10 winner of Hell's Kitchen.</i>

40:17.093 --> 40:19.194
And I [Bleep] come in here
with 250 [Bleep] percent!

40:19.229 --> 40:21.430
I'm probably one of the only
people in this competition

40:21.464 --> 40:23.131
that's won so many challenges.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.934
<i>The only person who did well
on the men's team was a woman!</i>

40:25.969 --> 40:27.069
Thank you, Robyn.

40:27.103 --> 40:29.838
(Robyn) I definitely had some
memorable experiences here.

40:29.872 --> 40:31.807
<i>Ladies, jump aboard your g4.</i>

40:31.841 --> 40:33.342
- (Robyn) And...
- Raw!

40:33.376 --> 40:34.676
Some experiences I'd like to forget.

40:34.711 --> 40:36.178
You called me a [Bleep] bitch today,

40:36.212 --> 40:38.247
and you want me to keep my mouth shut?

40:38.281 --> 40:40.282
Coming here, I didn't realize
it was gonna be this catty.

40:40.316 --> 40:41.283
[Bleep] Hit me!

40:41.317 --> 40:42.851
Robyn! Hit me!

40:42.885 --> 40:44.686
Robyn! Don't even [Bleep]
get me ghetto, Kimmie!

40:46.322 --> 40:47.656
But there was 18 of us.

40:47.690 --> 40:49.091
I made it to the final six.

40:49.125 --> 40:50.892
- Robyn...
- Yes, Chef?

40:50.927 --> 40:52.094
Put that on.

40:52.128 --> 40:53.528
You will not regret this decision,

40:53.563 --> 40:54.896
I swear to you.

40:54.931 --> 40:56.231
I'm a winner no matter what, in my book.

40:56.266 --> 40:57.366
And now, leaving here

40:57.400 --> 40:59.067
is gonna push me harder
and harder to succeed

40:59.102 --> 41:00.769
and show all those [Bleep]
that are still here,

41:00.803 --> 41:02.571
go [Bleep] yourself,
'cause I am better than you.

41:03.773 --> 41:05.807
Right now...

41:05.842 --> 41:07.175
<i>I still don't know.</i>

41:07.210 --> 41:08.610
Who's going to Vegas.

41:08.645 --> 41:09.611
Can I ask you one more thing, Chef?

41:09.646 --> 41:10.312
[Bleep] Hell.

41:10.346 --> 41:11.346
I need to step it up.

41:11.381 --> 41:14.216
I need to show you and I need
to show my team that... as well.

41:14.250 --> 41:16.018
I don't look at you, and I see Vegas.

41:17.086 --> 41:19.721
Change my mind or get hungry.

41:20.757 --> 41:21.790
Now get out of here.

41:21.824 --> 41:23.325
(All) Yes, Chef.

41:23.359 --> 41:25.527
When Chef Ramsay said he didn't see Vegas,

41:25.561 --> 41:28.497
that really, really, really,
really [Bleep] bothered me.

41:28.531 --> 41:30.299
That just lit a spark under my ass.

41:30.333 --> 41:31.700
You're gonna see a whole new Clemenza.

41:31.734 --> 41:33.969
I'll [Bleep] tattoo a slot machine
on my ass if it [Bleep] helps.

41:34.003 --> 41:35.904
(Dana) There are only four people

41:35.938 --> 41:37.472
between me and the prize.

41:37.507 --> 41:40.609
One by one, everybody's gotta go down.

41:40.643 --> 41:43.145
Because I'm about to win this [Bleep]!

41:43.179 --> 41:44.746
Making it to the black jacket

41:44.781 --> 41:46.014
was a dream come true for Robyn.

41:46.049 --> 41:47.616
But cooking against the runner-up

41:47.650 --> 41:49.351
was a reality check...

41:49.385 --> 41:51.086
for her and for me.

41:55.158 --> 41:58.493
<i>(Announcer) Next time on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

41:58.528 --> 42:00.629
We are walking out minus Robyn!

42:00.663 --> 42:03.498
(Announcer) As the final five
celebrate Robyn's departure...

42:03.533 --> 42:05.901
I was never happy to see
someone go until today.

42:05.935 --> 42:08.603
(Announcer) Chef Ramsay brings
someone back into the game.

42:08.638 --> 42:10.038
Oh, my God!

42:10.073 --> 42:12.007
(Announcer) That will
flip the competition...

42:12.041 --> 42:14.042
Oh, [Bleep]! (Announcer) Upside down.

42:14.077 --> 42:15.877
Are you guys [Bleep] kidding? Ohh.

42:15.912 --> 42:17.813
(Announcer) And Barbie hatches a plan...

42:17.847 --> 42:19.314
It's all strategy.

42:19.349 --> 42:21.283
<i>Clemenza, I'm hoping we can work together.</i>

42:21.317 --> 42:22.951
She's trying to build an alliance.

42:22.985 --> 42:25.587
I'm seeing this new Barbie emerge.

42:25.621 --> 42:27.489
(Announcer) But is Clemenza an ally...

42:27.523 --> 42:29.191
Clemenza, take the risotto.

42:29.225 --> 42:31.526
It's not ready. Clemenza,
take the risotto!

42:31.561 --> 42:32.761
(Announcer) Or a scapegoat?

42:32.795 --> 42:34.663
Overcooked [Bleep].

42:34.697 --> 42:36.498
- It's an insult to Italy.
- Told ya.

42:36.532 --> 42:38.700
(Announcer) It all goes down, next time...

42:38.735 --> 42:40.202
Don't wait till the end of service.

42:40.236 --> 42:41.269
Get the [Bleep] out of here.

42:41.304 --> 42:42.404
(Announcer) On a highly combustible...

42:42.438 --> 42:43.972
It's a [Bleep] [Bleep] show.

42:44.006 --> 42:46.041
(Announcer) And dangerously explosive...

42:46.075 --> 42:48.076
And we're cooking like [Bleep] idiots.

42:48.111 --> 42:49.611
There's no way Chef Ramsay's
shutting us down today.

42:49.645 --> 42:50.912
<i>(Announcer) Hell's kitchen.</i>

42:50.947 --> 42:52.214
I beg you to go home.

42:52.248 --> 42:53.882
What the [Bleep] is going on?
