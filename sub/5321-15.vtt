worries me more than
if they just kept attacking.

Have there been any side effects
from the vaccine?

Side effects?

21:33.960 --> 21:36.850
- Thought the US government collapsed years ago.
- It did.

21:37.000 --> 21:39.731
The whole idea of a nation state
is a thing of the past.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.521
A new world is rising
from the ashes of the old.

21:43.680 --> 21:46.001
A better world. Zona.

21:47.240 --> 21:48.890
Zona?

21:49.040 --> 21:52.408
I've heard of that.
This crazy pilot in Roswell.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.210
He was gonna fly
some experimental aircraft

21:54.360 --> 21:56.044
back to Zona.

21:56.200 --> 21:58.202
We thought he was nuts.
Zona's real?

21:58.360 --> 22:02.604
Zona is more than just real.
It's the future.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.410
Early in the apocalypse,

22:04.560 --> 22:07.006
a group of visionary
world leaders and businessmen

22:07.160 --> 22:10.289
embarked on a plan
to save humanity.

22:10.440 --> 22:13.125
Together, they created
a zombie-free island

22:13.280 --> 22:15.726
where the seeds of the next human race
have been planted.

22:15.880 --> 22:18.167
What about the old human race?

22:18.320 --> 22:20.004
Time may be running out.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.606
The pilot you met
was part of a larger plan

22:22.760 --> 22:25.730
to recover advanced technology
and cultural heritage

22:25.880 --> 22:27.530
before it's lost forever.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.604
Unfortunately,
both tend to be very fragile.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.242
We're in a race against time
to hold on to what makes us human.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.607

the human race,

22:48.560 --> 22:51.564
maybe we'd better get started.

before the outbreak.

enough power and resources

But the vaccine
only slows down the virus.

or make you immune.

I've been a one-man apocalypse
all my life.

33:58.680 --> 34:04.562
I'm not afraid to die.
Death - shit, that's all I know.

34:06.120 --> 34:07.804
I know it don't mean shit,

34:07.960 --> 34:10.485
but I apologise.

34:12.440 --> 34:14.647
I'm not that man
who killed your family, man.

34:17.120 --> 34:18.645
That man is dead.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.880
Killed by the Zs when you
threw me down that hole.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.728
In that one second,

34:24.880 --> 34:26.723
I saw every horrible,
malicious thing I ever did

34:26.880 --> 34:28.563
and I wanted to die
right there and then.

34:28.719 --> 34:32.202
But I knew if my life
were to have any meaning,

34:32.360 --> 34:34.283
I had to get out of there.

34:35.480 --> 34:38.404
I had to survive and make up
for all the things that I did.

34:39.920 --> 34:41.728
Maybe this is how I do it.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.567
Do me a favour, man.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.967
You pull that trigger.

(COCKS RIFLE)

34:59.640 --> 35:01.085
Do what you have to.

after you pull that trigger?

35:26.120 --> 35:28.248
(GUNSHOT)

35:31.720 --> 35:33.722
What happened?

35:52.080 --> 35:54.401
- I couldn't do it.
- I know.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.124
I'm glad.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.090
Not for him. For you.

36:03.480 --> 36:06.051
- Never did show you this, did I?
- No.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.809
She's beautiful.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.689
They both are.

36:17.240 --> 36:19.129
Come on. We better get going.

36:20.800 --> 36:22.928
My mission is over.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.685
Yeah.

36:25.840 --> 36:27.490
So is mine.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.569
You better go.

36:33.960 --> 36:35.564
Well, I ain't gonna say goodbye.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.643
Me neither.

36:40.160 --> 36:42.242
Well...

36:44.560 --> 36:47.166
Watch out for those
puppies and kittens, huh?

36:54.160 --> 36:56.083
I will.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.250
- What happened?
-ls he alive?

37:11.400 --> 37:12.925
WARREN: He's alive.

37:14.680 --> 37:16.762
He's not coming.

37:16.960 --> 37:18.644
Well, what do we do now, chief?

37:18.800 --> 37:21.883
I don't know.
I'm not in charge anymore.

38:15.600 --> 38:17.443
Got enough food, ammo
and Z-Weed for a month.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.010
I'm in.

38:22.600 --> 38:27.242
Well, look - if we need to,
we kill him and take the truck.

38:35.240 --> 38:37.004
WARREN: We're only going
as far as the beach.

38:37.160 --> 38:39.049
I like the beach.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.243
Big sub like that,
gotta have a real medical team.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.411
Well, I hope
they don't bleed him dry.

39:56.560 --> 39:59.609
I hate to admit it,
but I kinda miss Murphy.

39:59.760 --> 40:01.410
Really?

40:01.560 --> 40:03.244
Didn't get to know him
too well,

40:03.360 --> 40:05.408
but he seemed like
kind of a dick.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.608
- That doesn't look good.
-ls it submerging?

40:19.520 --> 40:22.888
No. It's sinking.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.441
- Murphy.
-10K.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.245
Is that a boat?

40:33.240 --> 40:37.643
It's Murphy. He has Dr Merch
and the sub captain.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.723
What about 10K?

10K is on that boat!
