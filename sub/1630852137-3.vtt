WEBVTT

00:05.240 --> 00:08.520
It's a year of change for Juventus.

00:08.600 --> 00:12.120
A new coach and a group
searching for its balance.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.160
After the defeat against Barcelona,

00:15.280 --> 00:18.960
the team was able to react
by playing a great derby.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.280
He shoots! Ball in the net.
Torino now leads.

00:22.360 --> 00:27.280
This victory shows the soul of a team that
must combine the present and the future.

00:28.920 --> 00:32.840
Bonucci! Juventus now leads!

00:32.920 --> 00:36.240
Will Juventus find their new identity?

00:37.320 --> 00:39.000
Only time will tell.

00:45.000 --> 00:48.160
TURIN
DECEMBER 2020

00:48.240 --> 00:52.840
The victory of the derby brought
a positive atmosphere to Juventus,

00:52.920 --> 00:55.360
and the players are trying to re-energize.

00:58.800 --> 01:01.640
-Yes, Álvarito.
-Bravo, Isla!

01:01.720 --> 01:03.880
But there's no time to rest.

01:03.960 --> 01:08.560
In less than 24 hours, the team needs to
prepare for an even more challenging match

01:08.640 --> 01:10.760
against the fearsome Barcelona.

01:16.720 --> 01:18.120
JUVENTUS - BARCELONA
28 OCTOBER 2020

01:18.200 --> 01:21.760
In the first leg, Juventus suffered
a heavy defeat on home turf.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.920
Dembélé! Goal. Barcelona now leads.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.200
Messi shoots, ball in the net.
Barcelona's second goal.

01:27.280 --> 01:28.760
JUVENTUS 0 - 2
BARCELONA DEMBÉLÉ 14' - MESSI 90' + 1

01:28.840 --> 01:31.120
Now the two teams have the same score,

01:31.200 --> 01:33.160
but they both aim for the first place

01:33.240 --> 01:38.120
in order to have the chance of a more
favorable draw in the next stage.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.800
To get there,
Juventus must win 3-0 in Barcelona,

01:42.880 --> 01:46.880
a very difficult mission
for the new coach, Pirlo, and his staff.

01:47.320 --> 01:52.120
This is how they should be set
in the first line. Coach?

01:52.200 --> 01:55.120
We move our two strikers
on their two midfielders,

01:55.200 --> 01:57.600
taking on their external full-backs,

01:57.680 --> 02:02.800
with a one-on-one.
We move our wings right away

02:02.880 --> 02:06.160
and send a defender
to take on Messi along the flank.

02:06.240 --> 02:09.280
So, Danilo and Ramsey tackling Messi.

02:09.360 --> 02:13.280
If we have to go out, we go out
with Arthur, McKennie and Ramsey.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.840
And possibly Morata.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.320
Who moves to the fourth.

02:16.400 --> 02:19.520
On the tackling:
Danilo, Bonucci, Alex Sandro, De Ligt...

02:19.600 --> 02:20.680
De Ligt and Cuadrado.

02:20.760 --> 02:25.120
He can come in with the three versus three
along with Ramsey and Arthur.

02:25.600 --> 02:29.520
And if they come find us at midfield,
McKennie goes wider.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.400
-As I told him today, he's central.
-Yes, that's fine.

02:34.120 --> 02:39.880
A new victory in the Champions League
is a dream to turn into reality.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.600
The Champions is a tough path.

02:43.680 --> 02:44.880
You also need luck.

02:47.160 --> 02:50.960
So many teams want to win,
but just one gets to raise the cup.

02:54.440 --> 02:59.480
It's a tough mission because many clubs
in Europe, even more ready than us...

02:59.560 --> 03:01.160
GIORGIO CHIELLINI
DEFENDER

03:01.240 --> 03:03.480
...want to win this trophy.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.920
JUVENTUS - AJAX
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 1996

03:06.000 --> 03:08.840
Juventus last won the cup 25 years ago.

03:15.640 --> 03:19.600
Juventus has two European Cups
on their shelf.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.080
The 1996 Champions...

03:21.160 --> 03:22.480
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

03:22.560 --> 03:25.400
...relates to the greatest joy
for so many Juventini.

03:27.120 --> 03:32.160
From '96 to this day, Juventus got to
the Champions League Final five times

03:32.240 --> 03:33.840
and lost it all five times.

03:33.920 --> 03:36.480
JUVENTUS - BARCELONA
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE FINAL 2015

03:36.560 --> 03:40.520
Champions League is the biggest desire
of Juventus fans.

03:42.400 --> 03:45.240
The Champions League
is the reason why I still play.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.720
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

03:48.440 --> 03:52.080
Gigi Buffon has won every trophy,
except for the Champions League.

03:53.480 --> 03:57.040
Now that he's 43,
this could be his last chance.

03:57.120 --> 04:00.920
But first, he needs to check
the outcome of an old injury.

04:02.480 --> 04:07.360
I wanted to check the injury
he had a few years ago.

04:07.440 --> 04:13.440
Buffon has a big scar
due to a second degree strain...

04:13.680 --> 04:15.560
...he had three years ago.

04:15.640 --> 04:21.640
We try to be very, very careful
as he needs to be able to play well.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.160
This year I've been out of action twice.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.040
The first time for about nine days,
and the second one for ten.

04:30.920 --> 04:36.240
I want to get my hands dirty
and I want to help out on the pitch.

04:37.320 --> 04:41.800
I think I can still play those games
and play them well.

04:42.800 --> 04:47.640
A champion's secret for longevity
is not only limited to a great body.

04:47.720 --> 04:51.600
It's dependent on a strong mind
capable of withstanding pressure.

04:51.680 --> 04:57.680
I've never taken a day off in 25 years.

04:58.240 --> 05:03.560
When you know you have to perform,
when you know you're the star of the show,

05:06.720 --> 05:11.360
the sense of responsibility
is always in the back of your mind,

05:11.480 --> 05:17.440
reminding you of what's coming
in a couple of days.

05:21.600 --> 05:26.320
And this is exhausting,
especially for your mind.

05:28.360 --> 05:32.600
The rest of the team is training
ahead of the Champions League match.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.800
Pirlo must instill the right mindset
in the youngest players.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.240
No, on the other side!

05:43.200 --> 05:44.480
WESTON MCKENNIE
MIDFIELDER

05:56.960 --> 06:01.880
We must have the dribble
in the middle of the field, they're fewer.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.360
A winning mindset is the strongest weapon

06:06.440 --> 06:09.280
which can help scoring three goals away.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.800
Chiesa is tired. Look how he's kicking.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.160
Very tired.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.040
Why are the corner kicks this bad?

06:19.120 --> 06:21.680
They look like beasts, and they can't...

06:21.760 --> 06:23.320
We can't do one good cross.

06:23.400 --> 06:26.080
If you make a mistake,
they aim for the goal.

06:26.160 --> 06:29.640
In addition to a winning mindset,
having a record man

06:29.720 --> 06:32.320
like Cristiano Ronaldo
surely helps the team.

06:32.400 --> 06:36.400
He will have to withstand most
of the pressure during the match.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.640
We can't win 3-0 against Barcelona.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.160
-Cristiano said we can.
-Did he?

06:45.360 --> 06:46.760
If he scores six goals.

06:50.760 --> 06:56.160
Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo have been
the stars of soccer for the past 15 years.

06:58.120 --> 07:02.320
The two champions have scored
over 1,500 goals.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.360
CRISTIANO RONALDO
FORWARD

07:31.360 --> 07:36.520
In the west outskirt of Turin,
superfans Piero and Loris, father and son,

07:36.600 --> 07:39.480
are preparing
for the match against Barcelona.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.840
Dad, I came to get some stuff.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.920
Can you remind me where I put the scarves?

07:46.360 --> 07:47.840
What scarves are you taking?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.120
Don't take them all.

07:50.200 --> 07:52.320
The new one that you got me.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.000
You can't take them all.
What am I left with?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.600
Today I went to my parents' house.

07:57.680 --> 08:01.880
I took the chance to go and get some
of the pieces of my heart.

08:01.960 --> 08:04.680
Not that one! Don't even think about it!

08:07.400 --> 08:08.880
LORIS DOGLIO
JUVENTUS FAN

08:08.960 --> 08:11.520
Gigi Buffon truly represents Juve to me.

08:11.600 --> 08:16.520
No one can ever take away from me
the memories related to his saves.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.240
Gigi is Gigi. He's a superhero.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.360
I think I got everything.
If not, I'll come back.

08:22.800 --> 08:23.760
Back to the forefront.

08:27.920 --> 08:33.600
Always slow, keep the lower back straight.
Great. One more.

08:33.680 --> 08:35.360
Buffon gets the green light

08:35.440 --> 08:39.840
and he now has the chance to play
one more game in the Champions League.

08:41.840 --> 08:47.520
To avoid any further injuries,
you must definitely do prevention.

08:47.880 --> 08:53.880
By doing physiotherapy,
going to the gym, eating well at home,

08:53.960 --> 08:58.520
sleeping well at home
at appropriate hours for a sportsman.

08:58.880 --> 09:03.200
That's the only way I know

09:03.280 --> 09:05.440
to have the least possible injuries.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.600
BARCELONA
8 DECEMBER 2020

09:14.640 --> 09:16.040
It's match day.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.720
The team is doing a brief warm-up
at the hotel.

09:21.280 --> 09:26.000
This is Pirlo's last chance to explain
the schemes with which he hopes to win.

09:27.080 --> 09:31.880
With his staff, he evaluates what
formation to use. It's a crucial choice.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.880
Since they're going to keep low on us,

09:37.000 --> 09:39.360
tell Álvaro to rest on their player.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.880
If they have one, yes.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.400
The match is about to start.

09:57.000 --> 09:59.280
Juventus can only take the field

09:59.360 --> 10:02.880
and aim to win
with a difference of three goals

10:03.000 --> 10:05.640
in order to finish first in the group.

10:07.480 --> 10:12.400
Such an incredible match! These two teams
represent the history of soccer.

10:12.480 --> 10:16.120
It's the sixth day,
UEFA Champions League Group G.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.960
Leo Messi versus Cristiano Ronaldo.

10:19.040 --> 10:22.840
The best players in the world,
two phenomenal champions.

10:26.760 --> 10:31.600
They have to win for us fans,
but also to avoid

10:31.640 --> 10:35.720
surprises in the next draw.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.640
Watch out, Ronaldo throws himself in.
He's taken down.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.640
Penalty for Juventus.

10:59.400 --> 11:01.000
Ronaldo!

11:01.480 --> 11:05.920
Ronaldo's eleventh goal of the season,
and third in UEFA Champions League.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.560
Cuadrado can pass it
in the middle, watch out.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.880
McKennie! Second goal for Juventus!

11:15.360 --> 11:17.600
Scissor kick from the American.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.040
Messi is about to shoot. Messi shoots.

11:20.120 --> 11:21.560
Buffon!

11:21.640 --> 11:25.440
He saves it and says no to Lionel Messi.

11:38.160 --> 11:42.400
Messi shoots, Buffon. Messi tries again,

11:42.480 --> 11:45.800
Buffon says no again.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.640
Watch out for Jordi Alba,
ground ball, Messi, Buffon!

11:50.720 --> 11:52.400
Once again, he saved it.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.880
Gianluigi Buffon.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.560
Watch out for Messi. Messi!

11:58.640 --> 12:00.600
Buffon's save, once again.

12:00.680 --> 12:04.480
Three out of three,
Gianluigi Buffon is winning this battle.

12:05.080 --> 12:07.560
Juventus' captain is bringing the ball up.

12:07.640 --> 12:11.080
Wide shot for Cuadrado,
quick exchange with this narrow triangle.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.880
Cross from Cuadrado,
soft ball landing in the middle.

12:13.960 --> 12:18.080
Watch out, header, McKennie.
Penalty for Juventus!

12:18.600 --> 12:20.440
The handball by Lenglet,

12:20.520 --> 12:23.040
defender of Barcelona
and French national team,

12:23.120 --> 12:25.520
is a golden opportunity for Juventus.

12:28.960 --> 12:31.360
Ronaldo!

12:31.440 --> 12:32.640
3-0!

12:32.720 --> 12:36.040
It's the perfect match, here at Camp Nou!

12:36.120 --> 12:39.520
Andrea Pirlo's masterpiece!

12:45.920 --> 12:48.520
Lionel Messi again. Messi shoots. Buffon!

12:48.600 --> 12:52.840
For the fourth time in this match,
he said no to Lionel Messi.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.200
There's always Gigi.

12:56.280 --> 12:59.920
Watch out for Barcelona's captain, Messi.
Messi shoots. Ball's out.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.360
Messi!

13:05.640 --> 13:07.320
Buffon!

13:07.400 --> 13:13.000
Once again! The legendary Buffon says no
to Lionel Messi.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.480
Gigi is playing like a 20-year-old.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.720
Braithwaite towards Messi.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.160
Messi manages to pass.
Ronaldo steals the ball.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.960
Well done, Cristiano,
at not allowing the pass.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.920
Juventus wins 3-0!

13:33.000 --> 13:34.560
BARCELONA 0 - 3 JUVENTUS

13:34.640 --> 13:38.120
Thanks to this victory,
Juventus becomes the first Italian team...

13:38.200 --> 13:39.560
TEAM W D L PT
1 JUVENTUS 5 0 1 15

13:39.640 --> 13:44.080
...to score at least three goals in
Barcelona in a top European competition.

13:44.160 --> 13:48.480
Victories don't just come from great
players that are placed on the pitch.

13:48.560 --> 13:51.720
You understand that the work...

13:53.040 --> 13:58.040
...is not only done by the players, but
also by those who are around the players.

14:00.920 --> 14:02.240
They deserved to win.

14:02.320 --> 14:06.880
Pirlo's merit is obvious...

14:06.960 --> 14:11.640
...because the way
we faced Barcelona at Camp Nou

14:11.720 --> 14:15.960
was not defensive at all,
and was well-organized

14:17.280 --> 14:20.720
with many players on offense.

14:20.800 --> 14:25.880
I think they played the match
that reflects the kind of game

14:25.960 --> 14:27.680
that Pirlo wants.

14:27.760 --> 14:31.960
I think everyone around the team
lives the match the same way.

14:32.040 --> 14:35.840
That's eventually what leads you
to win titles and trophies.

14:39.800 --> 14:43.360
The goals that Juventus aims for
are always the same.

14:43.440 --> 14:45.920
To reach the highest levels
you must play to win.

14:47.560 --> 14:53.560
Defeats teach you to do better,
but it's always better to win.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.680
Happy, huh?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.800
The victory over Barcelona

15:03.880 --> 15:07.320
and the qualification in round 16...

15:07.400 --> 15:10.600
...brought a positive atmosphere
in the club.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.880
We are staying here forever

15:14.960 --> 15:18.800
We are staying here forever
With you

15:18.880 --> 15:23.720
We will never leave you
We are staying here forever

15:27.240 --> 15:29.760
Outside Juventus training center,

15:29.840 --> 15:34.640
Piero Doglio is hoping to meet
his son's idol, Gianluigi Buffon.

15:36.480 --> 15:38.320
Good morning, excuse me.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.360
Good morning, how are you?

15:40.440 --> 15:41.840
-Good. And you?
-Good.

15:41.920 --> 15:44.840
This is the commemorative jersey
of your hundred years.

15:44.920 --> 15:47.480
-Of my hundred years? Of course.
-No...

15:48.280 --> 15:52.760
-It's the thousand one.
-It's the thousand one.

15:52.840 --> 15:54.520
And we did...

15:54.600 --> 15:58.600
I wanted you to sign here,
in your number. Wait.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.200
-Let's place it...
-Just...

16:01.280 --> 16:03.120
Here, just stretch it down.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.920
-Should I sign here?
-Great.

16:05.000 --> 16:08.600
Gigi, I'm so tense that--
Like a bell.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.240
-Truly. Gigi, may I ask you...
-Sure.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.480
I took my son's soccer cards.
He doesn't know.

16:16.240 --> 16:20.840
He's crazy about Buffon. He adores you.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.280
You're like wine. Thank you.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.640
At my age, each game is a record.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.720
-You're amazing.
-Like the jackpot.

16:28.800 --> 16:30.480
You are... Look...

16:30.560 --> 16:32.360
more than the number one.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.920
You are more.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.720
Thank you so much. Bye.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.520
-For my son's 30th birthday.
-Thank you.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.000
I'm lost for words, guys.

16:46.200 --> 16:49.080
Gigi Buffon is number one for my son.

16:49.160 --> 16:52.760
It will be the best gift
for his 30th birthday.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.320
He will remember this forever.

16:58.880 --> 17:00.760
Raise you glasses.

17:02.000 --> 17:03.240
We're here for Loris.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.520
-Happy birthday!
-Happy birthday, Loris!

17:09.480 --> 17:12.040
We have been sharing this.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.320
Now that you're 30, I'm giving it to you.

17:15.400 --> 17:17.240
This is Gigi's jersey.

17:17.560 --> 17:18.760
It's yours now.

17:18.800 --> 17:20.720
You brought it here?

17:21.280 --> 17:24.720
We shared it, but now it's all yours.

17:24.800 --> 17:28.080
Fuck, you're inheriting already!

17:28.200 --> 17:30.800
-Open the damn jersey.
-Open it!

17:30.920 --> 17:31.920
Show it to us.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.080
-No!
-What?

17:36.920 --> 17:38.560
Shit, I didn't expect this.

17:39.800 --> 17:42.040
-The autograph!
-Is it authentic?

17:42.080 --> 17:46.080
No, Luca did it.
He's good at forging signatures.

17:47.720 --> 17:49.200
What a gift.

17:52.320 --> 17:53.560
What the hell...

17:54.800 --> 17:56.160
These are my...

17:56.240 --> 17:57.400
These too?

17:58.640 --> 18:01.640
Gigi touched that and signed them all.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.080
I arrived, and Gigi came out.

18:05.160 --> 18:06.400
He's huge.

18:06.480 --> 18:09.560
You're an asshole.
You could have called me!

18:09.640 --> 18:10.880
Finally.

18:10.960 --> 18:12.520
What a gift!

18:12.560 --> 18:14.640
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.720
It's beautiful, thank you.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.080
-Here's to Baffo.
-Here's to Baffo!

18:19.440 --> 18:21.320
Baffo, Baffo, Baffo!

18:21.400 --> 18:22.800
Great Baffo.

18:27.640 --> 18:31.400
Federico Chiesa has only been
with the team for three months,

18:31.480 --> 18:34.240
and he's determined to prove his worth.

18:34.320 --> 18:40.080
My goal is to improve each year.
Even if just 1%, I always want to improve.

18:41.400 --> 18:46.200
Kulu, McKennie, Frabotta and I are young,

18:46.560 --> 18:52.160
but, in my opinion,
we have the skills and mindset

18:52.240 --> 18:54.240
to play for Juventus.

18:56.800 --> 18:59.040
Pirlo has invested a lot on Chiesa.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.080
GUIDO VACIAGO
JOURNALIST

19:01.160 --> 19:03.000
He wanted him strongly

19:03.080 --> 19:08.320
because it was quite an expensive
business transaction for Juventus,

19:08.440 --> 19:11.160
but Pirlo insisted on it.

19:12.000 --> 19:16.560
Chiesa was chosen for his rare skills.

19:16.680 --> 19:20.880
He's one of the few Italian players
who knows how to skip the man,

19:20.960 --> 19:24.480
how to play man-to-man.
He can play both right and left,

19:24.560 --> 19:28.520
and he's fully settled
in the Juventus team.

19:29.800 --> 19:35.760
Buffon, Chiellini, Pirlo himself,
see Chiesa as one of them.

19:35.800 --> 19:41.800
He's someone who shares their personality
and DNA, their work ethic,

19:41.920 --> 19:47.080
and that dedication that has characterized
the Juventine DNA of this cycle.

19:47.200 --> 19:51.240
I often say that Chiesa reminds me a lot
of a young Chiellini,

19:51.320 --> 19:54.800
who started his journey
with Juventus in 2005.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.560
Is your girlfriend here, Fede?

19:56.640 --> 20:01.440
Yes, later I'll go home and watch a film.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.560
Such an easy life, without children.

20:05.640 --> 20:06.720
Later you'll go home,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.880
and you'll find three kids calling you,
"Daddy!"

20:10.960 --> 20:13.560
Giogio, the youngest calls me Giogio.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.680
Giorgio is a warrior on field.
He'd give everything for the team.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.440
FEDERICO CHIESA
FORWARD

20:21.520 --> 20:23.320
Off field, he's calm,

20:23.440 --> 20:25.080
he's not over the top.

20:25.800 --> 20:29.760
My schedule was:
from 3:00 to 5:00 I slept. Then...

20:29.800 --> 20:32.160
At what age? My age?

20:32.240 --> 20:33.320
Twenty-three.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.800
Then I'd study a bit. I'd play videogames.

20:36.920 --> 20:40.320
Aperitif at 7:30, dinner at 8:30 or 9:00.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.320
-Aperitif?
-Yes, with my friends.

20:42.440 --> 20:46.400
-Without Covid, we could have had dinners.
-That's for sure.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.720
TEAM W D L PT
4 JUVENTUS 6 5 0 23

20:48.800 --> 20:51.760
Juventus is in fourth position
with 23 points.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.920
In order to reach league leaders Milan,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.080
Juve must win the next match
at home against Atalanta.

20:57.640 --> 21:02.320
There are moments in the season
when we have to give continuity.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.400
Not only in terms of victories,

21:04.480 --> 21:07.800
but also of the attitude
shown in the last few games.

21:07.920 --> 21:10.080
That's what leads us to win.

21:10.160 --> 21:14.000
This is a great match that will allow us
to win the Scudetto.

21:14.080 --> 21:18.160
-Let's go get these three points!
-Let's go, come on!

21:18.240 --> 21:20.480
My only goal is to win.

21:21.640 --> 21:25.720
Winning the tenth Scudetto
is crucial because

21:26.320 --> 21:32.320
beyond the star we would earn
for winning ten Scudetti in a row,

21:32.440 --> 21:36.560
proving our strength
after such a turbulent season...

21:36.680 --> 21:37.880
LEONARDO BONUCCI
DEFENSE

21:37.960 --> 21:42.520
...would mean showing
what an incredible mindset we have.

21:42.560 --> 21:45.160
The group is united and strong,

21:45.240 --> 21:48.720
and winning would increase our strength
as a team.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.080
Off we go, enjoy Juventus-Atalanta.

21:57.000 --> 21:59.400
Juventus, with a great cross to Ronaldo!

22:06.520 --> 22:08.000
McKennie gets the ball back.

22:09.480 --> 22:11.120
Go alone, Álvaro.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.960
Ronaldo, who stumbles! Then Morata...

22:15.360 --> 22:17.160
The ball is out. Unbelievable.

22:21.720 --> 22:24.240
-Be bold. Be bold. Be bold.
-Go!

22:33.520 --> 22:34.800
Go, Fede!

22:39.160 --> 22:42.760
Juventus ahead by 1-0.
A fantastic goal by Federico Chiesa.

22:44.160 --> 22:45.000
Palomino.

22:45.080 --> 22:48.680
Rabiot, once again,
Freuler, about to shoot.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.920
He shoots and Atalanta scores.

22:52.000 --> 22:55.960
The score is now 1-1,
here at Allianz Stadium.

22:56.760 --> 23:00.680
The match between Juventus
and Atalanta is now over.

23:01.080 --> 23:05.040
Juventus ahead on the 29th minute
with Federico Chiesa.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.560
Despite Chiesa's performance,
the result slows down Juventus' race

23:09.640 --> 23:13.400
by bringing it to the third position,
four points behind Milan.

23:23.280 --> 23:26.600
In the Continassa HQ,
Manager Edoardo Bandini...

23:26.680 --> 23:27.520
Good morning.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.800
...responsible for the relationship
between sponsors and players,

23:30.880 --> 23:33.840
is organizing
the club's annual Christmas campaign.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.000
In this year's Christmas video,
I'd like to show the new players.

23:38.080 --> 23:43.080
Chiesa, Arthur, McKennie,
Kulusevski, Morata.

23:43.640 --> 23:49.360
Five profiles, all five different,
all five international. One Italian.

23:50.880 --> 23:54.880
And Cristiano can close the video.

23:54.960 --> 23:59.840
He can close with a wink,
with panettone and "Merry Christmas."

24:00.160 --> 24:04.280
Every year in early December,
we release the Christmas video.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.280
You jumped out.

24:11.480 --> 24:14.240
-Hi.
-Hi. Is everything ready? Good morning.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.440
-You're perfect.
-Wow.

24:19.200 --> 24:24.280
It aims to launch an ironic
and cute message to our fans,

24:24.360 --> 24:29.040
to promote some products

24:29.120 --> 24:32.120
that will be sold in stores and online.

24:32.520 --> 24:34.520
-That's it? Perfect.
-Yes.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.960
In the middle, otherwise...

24:37.040 --> 24:39.000
Who are you, the coach?

24:39.080 --> 24:43.240
We also want to get likes and comments,

24:43.320 --> 24:45.920
so engagement from our fans.

24:46.000 --> 24:49.280
We chose young players.

24:51.840 --> 24:52.880
Damn.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.520
We still have no news from Cristiano.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.800
I know it makes the difference.
He can turn this video

25:05.360 --> 25:07.840
into a massive hit,
or a massive nightmare.

25:10.320 --> 25:13.000
Before shooting,

25:13.600 --> 25:17.120
I'm extremely anxious.

25:18.160 --> 25:21.280
The first time
I met Cristiano Ronaldo was for

25:21.920 --> 25:24.040
Cristiano Ronaldo's launch.

25:26.560 --> 25:29.680
We had to create
Cristiano Ronaldo's launch video.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.080
Eu estou aqui.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.640
And so, of course,

25:36.720 --> 25:41.120
you feel the thrill of knowing
such an amazing global personality.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.520
I started sweating, I was so anxious.

25:47.120 --> 25:50.320
I turned around,
and three seconds later, boom.

25:50.400 --> 25:52.880
He's naked.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.280
His figure is majestic...

25:57.000 --> 26:00.200
I felt a bit embarrassed:
it was the first time I met him,

26:00.280 --> 26:04.080
and I had to tell him what to do
and how to do it.

26:04.680 --> 26:07.280
I said, "Okay, this is the home kit."

26:08.560 --> 26:14.560
After a second, he looked at himself and
said, "Good, black and white suits me."

26:15.680 --> 26:19.080
That's when the adventure
with Cristiano Ronaldo began.

26:24.440 --> 26:27.120
SHARE IT WITH THE HASHTAG.
#NOTANORDINARYNIGHT

26:27.640 --> 26:33.320
From the moment he walks
through that door, we have five minutes.

26:33.400 --> 26:35.440
In terms of the logistics:

26:35.520 --> 26:37.920
he arrives, I meet him in the hall,

26:38.000 --> 26:43.400
we put his sweater on, so we save time
and I can also give him a briefing.

26:43.480 --> 26:44.760
-Okay.
-Okay.

26:44.840 --> 26:46.920
As for the people in the room:

26:47.000 --> 26:52.520
only those who are needed stay.
Everyone else, out.

26:55.160 --> 26:59.240
He left home at 12:25.
He hasn't texted me yet, so...

27:08.560 --> 27:10.560
-Any news?
-No, not yet.

27:19.280 --> 27:20.280
Sorry.

27:21.000 --> 27:23.600
If this happens while he's here,
I'll faint.

27:24.120 --> 27:25.600
I'll drop dead.

27:30.640 --> 27:34.040
Perfect, I'm going to get him. Bye.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.840
-Is there a mirror?
-No.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.480
You don't have a mirror?

27:46.560 --> 27:48.040
Here, turn around.

27:48.800 --> 27:52.160
-That's not a mirror, it's a screen.
-You're perfect, trust me.

27:53.600 --> 27:56.080
-Let's go film.
-Yes, let's do it.

27:57.200 --> 28:01.720
Ah, Christmas lunch.
Finally, you can eat anything you want.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.040
But first...

28:08.240 --> 28:10.640
The most important thing.

28:16.640 --> 28:18.320
Wish them a Merry Christmas.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.320
Merry Christmas.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.600
Good first take!

28:22.680 --> 28:26.080
One last thing.
The lady talking to you is Luciana.

28:26.160 --> 28:29.760
So, you say, "You too, Luciana."

28:30.240 --> 28:33.360
You too, Luciana,
should wish them a Merry Christmas.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.040
Perfect.

28:38.920 --> 28:40.560
-Thank you. Bye.
-Thank you.

28:41.760 --> 28:47.640
He arrived, got changed and filmed
in only seven minutes. Unbelievable.

28:50.080 --> 28:54.080
I've been working with him for three years
and he still makes me sweat.

28:54.160 --> 28:58.840
Cristiano Ronaldo is very good indeed.
He never makes a mistake.

28:58.920 --> 29:04.920
I've never seen anyone
so focused even off the field.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.880
He knows how to smile and when to smile.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.680
Merry Christmas.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.800
Three days after the tie with Atalanta,

29:13.880 --> 29:16.960
Juve gets a comeback opportunity
against Parma,

29:17.040 --> 29:19.720
a team fighting at the foot of the table.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.320
Juve must score three points.

29:22.400 --> 29:27.040
Aaron, ball to the center, in between
right midfielder and left defender.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.600
If we turn around, get back inside.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.240
You too Rodri, ball in the middle.

29:32.320 --> 29:35.640
The central defenders,
if the midfielder is on the back,

29:36.280 --> 29:38.840
should be ready to advance,

29:39.560 --> 29:44.600
maybe for Kucka's touch, we must be ready
to come out if there is pressure.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.640
Parma is a special place for some players.

29:47.720 --> 29:50.240
Buffon spent ten years of his career here,

29:50.320 --> 29:53.840
and Kulusevski played with the Emilians
in the last season.

29:55.480 --> 29:57.160
Kulu? He needs to get better.

29:57.240 --> 30:00.000
He needs to train everyday.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.840
Getting his hands dirty.

30:01.920 --> 30:07.360
He's 20 years old. He's shy.
Better like this, actually.

30:07.440 --> 30:12.840
He's a good guy.
He will slowly grow stronger.

30:14.040 --> 30:17.440
The night before the match,
there's time to team up.

30:19.000 --> 30:22.080
Kulu, you wanted a friend
sitting next to you?

30:22.160 --> 30:23.600
There was no chair.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.480
There.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.240
The veterans have fun
teasing the youngest.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.440
He's in pain for tomorrow.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.600
-He's fine.
-As a former Parma player.

30:34.800 --> 30:38.520
You won't even have fans booing you
tomorrow. Don't worry.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.960
No, I heard them.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.600
I took all the fans' boos.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.840
It's the two of us, actually.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.440
There's no time to rest.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.160
The Championships continue.
A match every three days.

30:53.240 --> 30:54.440
PARMA
19 DECEMBER 2020

30:55.200 --> 30:59.000
Juventus must win,
to stand a chance against Milan.

30:59.520 --> 31:02.840
With Chiesa on the bench,
Pirlo relies on Kulusevski

31:02.920 --> 31:06.000
to support the Ronaldo-Morata axis
on attack.

31:06.080 --> 31:08.680
It's the 13th leg of Serie A

31:08.760 --> 31:11.560
and it's the night
of Parma versus Juventus.

31:12.960 --> 31:16.240
The first 20 minutes go by
without altering the score.

31:16.320 --> 31:17.520
Go, Kulu!

31:17.600 --> 31:21.240
But Juventus' pressing manages
to find a way through Parma's defense.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.320
There are people in the middle,
goal by Kulusevski!

31:24.400 --> 31:30.320
Kulusevski scores against his former team
and takes Juventus on an easy path.

31:30.400 --> 31:35.280
Wonderful goal!
Morata, he crosses to Ronaldo!

31:35.360 --> 31:41.240
Goal! Cristiano Ronaldo! 2-0 for Juventus!

31:41.320 --> 31:45.720
Again to Ronaldo! 3-0!

31:45.800 --> 31:50.200
Bernardeschi crosses to Morata.
Header, and it's goal!

31:50.280 --> 31:54.080
4-0 for Juventus. Álvaro Morata!

31:55.040 --> 32:00.560
Certain players, who have been...

32:00.640 --> 32:02.200
GIANLUIGI BUFFON
GOALKEEPER

32:02.280 --> 32:08.280
...the pivot of the team for years,
age and leave room for new generations.

32:08.360 --> 32:13.640
They are replaced
by other very talented players.

32:13.720 --> 32:18.000
The match is over.
Juventus wins against Parma.

32:18.080 --> 32:19.560
Our team is very young...

32:20.080 --> 32:25.360
...and, consequently, in perspective,

32:25.440 --> 32:28.720
if you give it a year or two,

32:28.800 --> 32:34.720
it can reopen a very long winning cycle.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.360
If we are not focused,
we embarrass ourselves.

32:48.800 --> 32:52.080
I have to live these games
only as a manager.

32:52.440 --> 32:56.440
We must go out there
and continue to win, win and win!

32:58.960 --> 32:59.960
COVID RUINS JUVENTUS
