        Cheers <i>is filmed</i>        
 <i>before a live studio audience.</i> 

00:04.571 --> 00:07.539
    Move it, you deadbeats.     
      We're closing early.      

00:07.640 --> 00:08.674
    Woody, our bartender's,     
        getting married,        

00:08.742 --> 00:09.775
      and we're all going       
        in the wedding.         

00:09.876 --> 00:11.377
Go on. Get the hell out of here.

00:11.444 --> 00:14.813
    If you're still thirsty,    
      go on over to Bob's.      

00:16.282 --> 00:19.952
     Gee, it's nice to see      
    my cousins again.           

00:21.254 --> 00:22.955
          You know, sitting here
            in my dinner jacket,

00:23.023 --> 00:24.890
              I feel I should be
                     tossing off

00:24.958 --> 00:28.494
             brittle Noel Coward
                    bon mots.   

00:29.696 --> 00:32.664
Do you know any brittle         
Noel Coward bon mots?           

00:32.732 --> 00:34.333
                     As a matter
                  of fact, I do.

00:34.401 --> 00:36.235
    It seems that after being   
         told that a very boring

00:36.302 --> 00:39.138
     acquaintance of his had put
     a bullet through his brain,

00:39.205 --> 00:43.876
      Coward said, "He must have
        been a remarkable shot!"

00:43.943 --> 00:47.446
Did he often find humor         
in the tragedy of others?       

00:47.514 --> 00:49.648
        Well, darling, you're   
        missing the humor, dear.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.817
He got his jollies              
from massive head trauma?       

00:51.885 --> 00:53.352
                        Don't...

00:53.420 --> 00:54.420
                  You're missing
                the whimsy...   

00:54.487 --> 00:56.021
Oh, for God's sake,             
Frasier!                        

00:56.089 --> 00:58.390
Can you imagine the state       
of mind that would drive a man  

00:58.458 --> 00:59.992
to do something like that?      

01:00.060 --> 01:02.394
Can you picture the despair     
he must have felt               

01:02.462 --> 01:06.498
facing a future in which        
any hope or joy seemed          
utterly impossible?             

01:06.566 --> 01:09.401
                I think I can   
             picture that, dear.

            So what'd you clowns
        get the happy couple?   

02:27.247 --> 02:29.548
Well, uh, you know, Carla,      
      recent surveys show       

02:29.616 --> 02:32.217
  there are a lot of wasteful   
 duplication in wedding gifts.  

02:32.285 --> 02:33.519
Yeah.                           

02:33.586 --> 02:34.887
Everybody gets like,            
you know...                     

02:34.954 --> 02:37.956
four toasters                   
and four-dozen fondue forks.    

02:38.024 --> 02:39.892
They always wind up sitting     
in a closet somewhere.          

02:39.959 --> 02:42.061
        Yeah, so, uh, we went   
         for the, uh, practical.
Yep.                            

02:43.296 --> 02:46.098
            Ta-dah!             

02:46.166 --> 02:47.766
             Hey, wait a minute.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.269
                Is that a new   
                    garbage can?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.237
Um... yeah.                     

02:54.441 --> 02:55.874
                Like hell it is.

02:55.942 --> 02:58.277
              You just took that
             out of your kitchen
            and brought it here!

02:58.345 --> 02:59.678
    Hey, this is a seasoned     
    receptacle, okay?           

02:59.746 --> 03:01.146
                        Oh, God!

03:01.214 --> 03:03.415
They got some fetish to look    
at a brand-new garbage can,     

03:03.483 --> 03:05.017
    they can come over          
         to my kitchen.         

03:07.887 --> 03:09.455
          Darling, what's taking
                    you so long,

03:09.522 --> 03:11.123
                just to write   
                  a simple card?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.292
We're the most articulate       
couple Woody and Kelly know.    

03:13.360 --> 03:14.693
I'd like to leave them          
with some words                 

03:14.761 --> 03:17.029
they can reread and cherish     
20 years from now.              

03:17.097 --> 03:20.232
                Yeah, if they're
             still married then.

03:20.300 --> 03:22.634
            Forgive me if I seem
          unduly cynical, but...

03:22.702 --> 03:24.837
              geez, I've treated
             so many emotionally

03:24.904 --> 03:26.638
                scarred husbands
                      and wives,

03:26.706 --> 03:28.040
                it's hard for me
              to get sentimental

03:28.108 --> 03:29.975
                over a simple   
                  greeting card.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.243
            What'd you write?   

03:31.311 --> 03:33.879
"May you never forget the way   
your hearts leapt up            

03:33.947 --> 03:36.815
when first you gazed            
into each other's eyes."        

03:36.883 --> 03:39.685
        (crying):               
        Oh, God Lilith!         
    I still remember!           

03:41.721 --> 03:45.691
Whoa, guys, this is going to be 
some kind of wedding reception. 

03:45.759 --> 03:48.627
I tell you, it was pretty nice  
of Mr. Gaines to buy            

03:48.695 --> 03:49.762
    all his liquor from us.     

03:49.829 --> 03:50.929
 I think I'm going to throw in  

03:50.997 --> 03:52.998
that special case of wine       
         I got in here.         

03:53.066 --> 03:54.800
          Sam, you might as well
            leave on your apron.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.068
You're going down to the cellar.

03:56.136 --> 03:58.037
    Oh, yeah, you're right.     

03:58.104 --> 04:00.072
        (humming)               

04:02.809 --> 04:04.877
 It's all cobwebby down there.  

04:06.813 --> 04:09.248
It's a perfectly                
sensible precaution.            

04:09.315 --> 04:11.417
After all, it's not as though   
he slept in a shower cap.       

04:11.484 --> 04:12.351
                          No.   

04:12.419 --> 04:14.920
            Oh, well,           
        so what if he did?      

04:16.923 --> 04:18.156
          I mean, uh,           

04:18.224 --> 04:20.959
    like any guy might.         

04:21.027 --> 04:23.462
 You know, to keep the spiders  
         off his head.          

04:25.298 --> 04:29.034
Do you realize, when I publish  
my book on borderline psychosis,

04:29.102 --> 04:32.338
every penny I ever spent        
in this bar will be deductible? 

04:34.007 --> 04:35.374
I just hope                     
it's a short wedding.           

04:35.442 --> 04:37.209
I can't wait to get             
to that cake.                   

04:37.277 --> 04:38.777
I'm starving.                   

04:38.845 --> 04:40.379
                     So I gather
                the preparations
                  for this event

04:40.447 --> 04:41.580
                    have been   
                somewhat lavish.

04:41.648 --> 04:43.215
"Somewhat"?!                    

04:43.283 --> 04:45.651
      We are talking about      
    the wedding of the year!    

04:45.719 --> 04:47.152
    Look at this guest list--   

04:47.220 --> 04:49.822
    tycoons, philanthropists,   
            European royalty.   

04:49.889 --> 04:52.658
     The kind of wonderful crowd
that I could be mingling with   

04:52.726 --> 04:54.893
        right now if Robin and I
          had stayed together...

04:54.961 --> 04:56.762
            which, of course,   
                      we didn't.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.964
                 He went his way
                 and I went mine

04:59.032 --> 05:01.166
             and the dream ended
        and... that was that.   

05:01.234 --> 05:02.801
                And now I've got
                to go over there

05:02.869 --> 05:05.070
                and schlep booze
              so those rich pigs

05:05.138 --> 05:07.906
                can pour it down
             their ugly throats!

05:07.974 --> 05:11.010
                     Life sucks.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.812
             Okay to call on you
            for a wedding toast?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.019
    Hey, here's the blushing    
        bridegroom now.         

05:20.086 --> 05:21.086
    Hi.                         

05:21.154 --> 05:22.454
        How're you doing, Woody?

05:22.522 --> 05:24.757
          Fine. Fine.           

05:24.824 --> 05:26.492
What're you smiling about there?

05:26.559 --> 05:28.227
    Am I smiling, Sam?          

05:28.294 --> 05:30.362
        Okay, I'll stop.        

05:35.135 --> 05:36.802
    You're acting all weird.    
        What's going on?        

05:36.870 --> 05:38.570
    Am I acting weird, Sam?     

05:38.638 --> 05:40.839
        Okay, I'll stop.        

05:40.907 --> 05:42.074
Yeah, you're spacing out.       

05:42.142 --> 05:43.776
        You've got that         
    goofy look on your face     

05:43.843 --> 05:45.511
                and that look   
                    in your eyes

05:45.578 --> 05:46.845
                that I always   
              get right after...

05:46.913 --> 05:50.082
              Aw, don't tell me.

05:50.150 --> 05:53.052
You and Kelly couldn't wait till
  your wedding night, could you?

05:53.119 --> 05:54.553
            Oh...               

05:58.692 --> 06:00.793
It gives me a whole new         
prospective, Sam.               

06:00.860 --> 06:02.327
You know, suddenly I            
understand all those jokes      

06:02.395 --> 06:03.562
you guys have                   
been telling me.                

06:03.630 --> 06:05.831
And by the way,                 
ha-ha, Mr. Peterson.            

06:07.667 --> 06:10.135
And ha-ha-ha, Mr. Clavin.       

06:10.203 --> 06:13.472
And ho-ho-ho, shame             
on you, Dr. Crane.              

06:16.476 --> 06:19.244
Tell me, Woody, why, after      
three years of chastity         

06:19.312 --> 06:21.513
and just hours                  
before the wedding?             

06:21.581 --> 06:23.882
    Well, Kelly was modeling    
         her trousseau.         

06:23.950 --> 06:27.419
  And she just looked so good,  
and we couldn't help ourselves. 

06:27.487 --> 06:29.321
And we figured                  
it's okay as long               

06:29.389 --> 06:31.523
as we're getting married        
today, you know.                

06:31.591 --> 06:33.225
You still respect me,           
right, Sam?                     

06:33.293 --> 06:35.594
    Aw, come on, you'd still    
respect me, wouldn't you?       

06:35.662 --> 06:37.563
Let's not open up               
that can of worms.              

06:39.299 --> 06:41.867
                      Ah, Woody,
                    I understand
                     completely.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.870
    You know, forbidden fruit   
          is often the sweetest.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.106
              Many men look back
            on premarital sex   

06:47.173 --> 06:49.041
                as the last real
                 thrill they had

06:49.109 --> 06:51.810
        before the cold, dead   
            hand of matrimony   

06:51.878 --> 06:55.881
turned what was once exciting   
     into predictable routine...

06:55.949 --> 06:57.016
(rhythmic clinking)             

06:58.852 --> 07:00.986
            According to this   
            idiotic book I read.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.824
    I just worry about          
        Kelly's father.         

07:05.892 --> 07:07.192
    He's pretty traditional     
      about those things.       

07:07.260 --> 07:09.228
        I wouldn't want         
        him finding out.        

07:09.295 --> 07:10.229
        Hi, lover.              

07:12.198 --> 07:15.034
    Gee, I don't know           
    what would tip him off.     

07:15.101 --> 07:17.703
    Shouldn't you be home       
    getting dressed?            

07:17.771 --> 07:19.204
Uh-huh,                         
but I missed you.               

07:19.272 --> 07:22.041
    Oh, I missed you, too.      

07:22.108 --> 07:24.043
             You know, no matter
             how often I see it,

07:24.110 --> 07:26.879
    the sight of young lovers   
    never fails to make me sick.

07:28.815 --> 07:31.316
        Kelly.                  
        Kelly...                

07:31.384 --> 07:33.152
    Kelly!                      
    (clears throat)             

07:33.219 --> 07:35.387
    Look, uh, I gotta           
    ask you something.          

07:35.455 --> 07:38.357
I'm making you guys             
an astrological marriage chart  

07:38.425 --> 07:39.591
for a wedding present.          

07:39.659 --> 07:41.927
And I gotta get                 
some information.               

07:41.995 --> 07:44.963
         Oh, gee, I...          
     I don't know my sign,      

07:45.031 --> 07:48.067
  but I know I'm not a Virgo.   

07:49.936 --> 07:51.503
CARLA:                          
I know your date of birth       

07:51.571 --> 07:53.072
and where you were born,        

07:53.139 --> 07:56.175
but what I gotta                
know is what time               
you were born exactly.          

07:56.242 --> 07:58.410
                     It was 8:00
                 in the morning.
    Okay.                       

07:58.478 --> 08:01.547
    I weighed seven pounds,     
         three ounces.          

08:01.614 --> 08:03.148
      I had very fine hair      

08:03.216 --> 08:06.185
  and a tiny little birthmark   
        on my shoulder.         

08:06.252 --> 08:08.320
 Daddy said it was the sweetest 
    thing you've ever seen.     

08:08.388 --> 08:10.055
Yeah, yeah, yeah.               

08:10.123 --> 08:12.591
KELLY:                          
Can you believe that sweet,     

08:12.659 --> 08:14.226
innocent baby girl grew up      

08:14.294 --> 08:16.628
    and got it on with          
the Woodman this morning?       

08:24.971 --> 08:29.942
8:00 a.m. Got it. Okay.         

08:30.010 --> 08:31.310
    Kelly, who's performing     
         the ceremony?          

08:31.378 --> 08:33.212
    Don't you have an uncle     
    who's a minister?           

08:33.279 --> 08:35.179
    Yes, Uncle Roger.           

08:35.248 --> 08:36.615
    But it didn't seem          
    right to ask him.           

08:36.683 --> 08:38.549
    He's going through          
 a terrible divorce right now.  

08:38.618 --> 08:40.119
Apparently, he got              
tired of coming home            

08:40.186 --> 08:43.054
      and finding his wife      
    in bed with Hives.          

08:43.123 --> 08:45.124
            Well, it's pretty   
             insensitive of him.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.992
     Hives is their butler.     

08:47.060 --> 08:47.993
                    Oh.         

08:49.896 --> 08:52.698
CARLA:                          
Oh, oh...                       

08:52.766 --> 08:55.300
      Oh, bad news, guys.       

08:55.368 --> 08:56.669
    The wedding's off.          

08:56.736 --> 08:58.437
      What are you talking      
         about, Carla?          

08:58.505 --> 09:00.773
Well, according                 
to my chart,                    

09:00.840 --> 09:03.342
this is the worst possible day  
for you guys to get married.    

09:03.410 --> 09:05.144
If you do, the wedding          
will be a disaster.             

09:05.211 --> 09:07.813
            CLIFF:              
        Oh, for crying          
          out loud, Carla!      

09:07.881 --> 09:10.182
You ought to know by now,       
  horoscopes are for suckers.   

09:10.250 --> 09:12.818
Oh, they're for                 
suckers, huh, Clavin?           

09:12.886 --> 09:15.254
     Sure. I was reading an     
     article debunking them     

09:15.321 --> 09:19.358
        in last month's         
      <i>UFO Spotter's Guide.</i>      

09:21.695 --> 09:24.830
                 You know, kids,
        astrology is bad enough,

09:24.898 --> 09:26.498
      but she's also a Cassandra
            into the bargain,   

09:26.566 --> 09:28.167
        always prophesying doom.

09:28.234 --> 09:30.169
        You know, when Lilith   
              and I got married,

09:30.236 --> 09:34.606
          she predicted that our
     marriage would descend into
    a life of endless bickering.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.408
         That's not exactly what
              she said, Frasier.

09:36.476 --> 09:37.743
Yes it is, word for word.       

09:37.811 --> 09:40.412
      No, you're misremembering,
                    as usual.   

09:40.480 --> 09:41.880
It's my story.                  

09:41.948 --> 09:43.315
Why can't you keep              
your oar out?                   

09:43.383 --> 09:45.451
         Because inaccuracy is a
        mark of sloppy thinking.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.152
And what is butting in          
a mark of?!                     

09:50.857 --> 09:51.790
I'm telling you, Woody,         

09:51.858 --> 09:53.192
You've got to call              
this thing off.                 

09:53.259 --> 09:55.294
Just reschedule it for          
any other day but this.         

09:55.362 --> 09:56.862
                Well, that's out
         of the question, Carla.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.364
      After what happened       
         this morning,          

09:58.431 --> 10:01.133
Kelly and I have to get married,
  or she'll be a fallen woman,  

10:01.201 --> 10:03.035
 and I'll have brought disgrace 
      on my whole family,       

10:03.103 --> 10:04.636
just like                       
Uncle Orlo.                     

10:04.704 --> 10:06.305
     He got caught checking     
          into a motel          

10:06.373 --> 10:09.208
with a cream separating machine.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.310
 It may not seem shocking now,  

10:11.378 --> 10:14.680
but in the early '60s, that was 
    considered pretty weird.    

10:16.983 --> 10:18.650
 No, got to get married today.  

10:18.718 --> 10:19.752
                  Woody's right.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.186
                 If we don't get
                  married today,

10:21.254 --> 10:23.322
             we'll never be able
             to face each other.

10:24.691 --> 10:25.858
     Okay, suit yourselves,     

10:25.925 --> 10:27.126
but don't blame me.             

10:27.193 --> 10:28.394
                    Aw, come on,
            don't listen to her.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.661
    Okay, Kelly, we'd           
      better get you home       

10:29.729 --> 10:31.063
      so you can get into       
      that wedding dress.       

10:31.131 --> 10:32.731
    Now come on you two,        

10:32.799 --> 10:34.566
      cut it out. Come on.      

10:34.634 --> 10:36.101
    Otherwise, you're going     
     to be getting married      

10:36.169 --> 10:38.370
    in nothing but high heels   
             and a wedding veil.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.872
    How would that look, huh?   

10:39.939 --> 10:41.206
Trust me, Sam.                  

10:41.274 --> 10:42.908
            (laughing)          

10:46.146 --> 10:48.013
    Oh, that's great.           

10:48.081 --> 10:49.848
Okay, Rebecca, you ready to go? 

10:49.916 --> 10:51.684
     Uh, no, no, no. I want     
  a picture of everybody first  

10:51.751 --> 10:53.719
    with us all dressed up.     
            Come on.            

10:53.787 --> 10:55.688
Everybody get over              
here on the steps.              

10:55.755 --> 10:57.589
     You know, it's amazing     
how different we all look       

10:57.657 --> 10:58.691
    when we're dressed up...    

10:58.758 --> 11:01.760
     sort of sophisticated      
         and debonair.          

11:03.329 --> 11:05.597
             CLIFF:             
Hey, for crying out loud, Norm! 
    You stepped on my shoe!     

11:05.665 --> 11:07.599
 Do you know how long it took me
    to get that shine on there?!

11:07.667 --> 11:10.569
NORM:                           
Oh, did Cliffy get his little   
shoesy-woosey messed up?        

11:10.637 --> 11:12.538
              Hey!              
     Will you knock it off?     

11:12.605 --> 11:14.973
     How would you like a smear 
     on your "triple Es" pal?!  

11:15.041 --> 11:17.576
                Okay, all right,
                I've got it set.

11:17.644 --> 11:19.845
        In five seconds         
     the picture goes off.      

11:23.183 --> 11:25.117
    (camera shutter clicks)     

11:26.186 --> 11:29.288
        Darn it, I think        
      my eyes were closed!      

11:43.503 --> 11:44.603
                 Come on, Carla.

11:44.671 --> 11:46.438
                As soon as we're
            finished setting up,

11:46.506 --> 11:47.740
                we can enjoy    
                the wedding.    

11:47.807 --> 11:48.907
I'm telling you, Rebecca,       

11:48.975 --> 11:50.342
nobody's gonna enjoy            
this wedding.                   

11:50.443 --> 11:51.910
      The stars don't lie.      

11:51.978 --> 11:53.946
The day is gonna be a disaster. 

11:54.014 --> 11:57.316
There's gonna be carnage,       
bloodshed, destruction.         

11:57.384 --> 12:00.285
People will be fighting         
each other to get on stretchers 

12:00.353 --> 12:02.988
     and begging to be put      
      out of their misery.      

12:03.056 --> 12:04.957
              Carla, if you feel
            that way, why didn't
             you just stay home?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.359
What? And spend the night       
         with my kids?          

12:07.460 --> 12:10.229
  (dogs barking and growling)   

12:11.431 --> 12:13.365
        Whew! Boy,              
         I'll tell you,         

12:13.433 --> 12:16.235
 those are two of the fiercest  
guard dogs I've ever seen.      

12:16.302 --> 12:18.971
          Mr. Gaines says if you
          just call them by name

12:19.039 --> 12:21.340
    and speak firmly to them,   
        they're gentle as lambs.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.641
Well, that's                    
good to know.                   

12:22.709 --> 12:23.709
     What are their names?      

12:23.877 --> 12:26.145
              Hitler and Attila.

12:26.212 --> 12:29.348
      What do you want me       
     to do with this wine?      

12:29.449 --> 12:31.684
          Uh, why don't you just
            put it over there   
             in the wine closet?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.752
All right. Oh, oh, oh.          

12:33.820 --> 12:35.754
                Wine closet.    

12:40.894 --> 12:42.995
                 These certainly
                 look delicious.

12:43.063 --> 12:44.897
        Uh! Uh!                 
                        Ow!     

12:44.998 --> 12:46.799
(with French accent):           
I have told you again           
and again--                     

12:46.866 --> 12:48.801
don't touch the food!           

12:48.868 --> 12:50.869
I am the caterer.               
You are just...                 

12:50.937 --> 12:52.037
bar people.                     

12:52.138 --> 12:54.306
Why are you being so rude?      

12:54.374 --> 12:56.175
                 You know, we're
                  caterers, too.

12:56.242 --> 12:59.411
Opening a bag of potato chips   
does not make you a caterer.    

12:59.479 --> 13:01.113
    Huh. That is not a bag.     

13:01.181 --> 13:02.414
         That is a can.         

13:02.515 --> 13:06.552
         Those are Pringles, Mr.
      Big-Time-Know-It-All chef.

13:08.755 --> 13:12.358
     Hey, that's the nicest     
 wine closet I've ever been in. 

13:12.425 --> 13:14.927
     Well, Robin and I were     
      gonna have one, too.      

13:15.028 --> 13:17.229
                    It was gonna
                     have stereo

13:17.364 --> 13:19.598
     and hanging plants and     

13:19.699 --> 13:22.234
            two little chairs   
             and a little table,

13:22.302 --> 13:24.336
                and we would sit
             there late at night

13:24.404 --> 13:26.338
             with a very special
                 bottle of wine.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.376
             The son of a bitch.

13:31.444 --> 13:33.746
You wanted to talk              
to me, Mr. Gaines?              

13:33.813 --> 13:36.615
            Yes, Woody, now that
            we're almost family,

13:36.683 --> 13:39.418
            Mr. Gaines sounds   
         pretty cold and formal.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.819
        Dad?                    

13:40.887 --> 13:43.922
        But better than that;   
        have a seat here, Woody.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.858
                     Now, Woody,
                I don't think   

13:45.925 --> 13:47.693
                 I've ever tried
                to hide the fact

13:47.761 --> 13:49.161
                  that I dislike
                  you intensely.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.699
    I appreciate that, sir.     

13:53.767 --> 13:56.735
        The only reason         
    I've accepted this union    

13:56.803 --> 13:59.605
      is that my daughter       
    loves you so very much.     

13:59.673 --> 14:02.241
                Oh, I know she's
            had other suitors   

14:02.308 --> 14:03.509
                     with better
                    backgrounds,

14:03.576 --> 14:05.577
            but they all had one
        thing on their minds.   

14:05.645 --> 14:06.845
    They couldn't keep          
        their hands off         

14:06.913 --> 14:08.547
my little girl, and I hate that.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.115
            But you,            
    on the other hand,          

14:10.216 --> 14:12.818
 have always seemed to respect  
     and love my daughter.      

14:12.886 --> 14:14.186
                 But believe me,

14:14.320 --> 14:15.788
  if I thought for one moment,  

14:15.855 --> 14:18.123
  you didn't respect my Kelly,  
I'd call off this wedding       

14:18.191 --> 14:21.760
             and have those dogs
          of mine eat you alive.

14:21.828 --> 14:23.429
    Do I make myself clear?     

14:23.563 --> 14:24.697
         Oh, yes, sir.          

14:25.899 --> 14:27.900
Now, Woody,                     
I know this sounds              

14:27.967 --> 14:30.803
like a meddlesome father-in-law 
giving advice, but it isn't.    

14:30.870 --> 14:32.905
         It's a threat.         

14:35.175 --> 14:37.309
Think he's starting to like me. 

14:39.546 --> 14:41.080
          Hey, Woods.           

14:41.147 --> 14:44.416
Hey, ah, that is                
a good shot right there.        

14:44.484 --> 14:46.285
                    Okay, there,
                        Rebecca!

14:46.353 --> 14:47.553
                     Say cheese!

14:47.620 --> 14:49.555
              Oh!               
Oh, man!                        

14:49.622 --> 14:51.824
Think you got enough wattage    
in that thing?                  

14:51.891 --> 14:52.858
(camera shutter clicking)       

14:52.926 --> 14:54.159
        Oh...                   

14:54.227 --> 14:56.095
Hey, you're missing             
quite a party out there.        

14:56.162 --> 14:57.329
                    What are you
                  talking about?

14:57.397 --> 14:59.264
         I thought the reception
          was after the wedding.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.700
Oh, yeah, but as soon           
as he met Woody's relatives,    

15:01.768 --> 15:03.435
Mr. Gaines opened the bar       
right away.                     

15:05.071 --> 15:07.740
  Yeah, we'd better take some   
hors d'oeuvres out there.       

15:07.807 --> 15:09.875
I am not going                  
to tell you again.              

15:09.943 --> 15:12.311
Keep your hands                 
off my savories!                

15:12.379 --> 15:13.779
                            SAM:
                         Oh, my.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.149
I haven't heard that            
since high school.              

15:17.217 --> 15:19.351
      You-you have a real       
    attitude problem,           

15:19.419 --> 15:21.020
         you know that,         
    you little creep?!          

15:21.087 --> 15:22.287
                          CLIFF:
                            Hey.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.289
        Now you're taking <i>me</i>    
            back to high school.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.924
        Huh.                    

15:25.992 --> 15:27.459
            Yeah.               

15:27.527 --> 15:29.261
                  Teachers, huh?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.664
    As long as you two guys     
         are out here,          

15:32.732 --> 15:34.366
 why don't you give me a hand?  

15:34.434 --> 15:35.701
        (clapping)              

15:35.769 --> 15:37.036
        Hilarious.              

15:37.103 --> 15:39.038
 Cliff, dry off those glasses,  

15:39.105 --> 15:40.973
        and Norm,               
  open up those wine bottles.   

15:41.074 --> 15:43.342
    Hey, does anybody           
        have a plunger?         

15:43.410 --> 15:45.144
     Why? Something happen      
         to the toilet?         

15:45.211 --> 15:47.780
No, my Uncle Elroy              
left his leg on the bus,        

15:47.847 --> 15:49.782
and he wants to dance.          

15:53.586 --> 15:57.289
        Yeah, well, if I see it,
        I'll send it out to him.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.692
             Woody!             

15:59.759 --> 16:01.026
                      Woody, for
                  the last time,

16:01.094 --> 16:03.729
    will you call this thing off
        before disaster strikes?

16:03.797 --> 16:05.864
Carla, I couldn't               
even if I wanted to,            

16:05.932 --> 16:07.866
now that Kelly's                
in a family way.                

16:07.934 --> 16:09.835
Family way?                     
Just from this morning?         

16:09.903 --> 16:11.003
        Wouldn't surprise me.   

16:11.071 --> 16:12.571
                  Farm boys know
                these things.   

16:12.639 --> 16:15.174
             She's got that same
             glow we used to see

16:15.241 --> 16:16.542
        on the brood sow's snout

16:16.609 --> 16:18.811
         after we'd fed the hogs
                fermented swill.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.045
    Yeah?                       

16:20.113 --> 16:21.513
                    Pretty soon,
             she'll be grunting,

16:21.581 --> 16:23.849
                squealing and   
        cranking out piglets.   

16:23.917 --> 16:28.220
          Never lose those stars
             in your eyes, Wood.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.388
             Woody.             

16:29.456 --> 16:30.723
                          WOODY:
                      Oh, Kelly!

16:30.790 --> 16:32.591
    You ever look gorgeous!     

16:32.659 --> 16:34.293
KELLY:                          
Shh. Daddy would kill you       

16:34.361 --> 16:36.462
if he saw us together           
before the wedding.             

16:36.529 --> 16:38.497
                  Oh. Okay, I'll
                  see you later.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.466
See you later, Woody.           

16:42.268 --> 16:44.203
                          CLIFF:
                Oh, boy, huh?   

16:44.270 --> 16:46.572
             Yeah.              
        Looking at those two,   
            it's hard to believe

16:46.639 --> 16:48.440
        that one out of every   
    two-and-two-thirds marriages

16:48.508 --> 16:50.376
                 in this country
                ends in divorce.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.478
    Where do they get           
    those stupid statistics?    

16:52.579 --> 16:54.580
What is two thirds              
of a marriage?                  

16:54.647 --> 16:57.750
      Plenty, believe me.       

16:57.817 --> 17:00.386
         Hey, come on,          
        you guys.               

17:00.453 --> 17:02.454
        You heard Mr. Gaines.   
        Woody, if he sees you   

17:02.522 --> 17:04.757
  and Kelly smooching like that,
         he's gonna throw a fit!

17:04.824 --> 17:06.425
MR. GAINES:                     
Kelly, where are you?           

17:06.492 --> 17:09.028
        Oh, hey, Carla,         
 give me a hand here, will you? 

17:09.095 --> 17:10.863
I told you                      
disaster was gonna strike.      

17:10.930 --> 17:12.097
                Come here, come,
                  come out here.

17:12.165 --> 17:13.298
(dogs barking and barking)      

17:13.366 --> 17:14.599
MR. GAINES:                     
Kelly,                          

17:14.667 --> 17:15.768
you're not downstairs, are you? 

17:15.902 --> 17:17.636
     You have to hide her!      

17:17.737 --> 17:20.939
    Uh, yeah, Kelly, out through
      the, uh, s-swinging doors.

17:21.007 --> 17:21.906
                     No, no, no.
              Nobody can see her

17:21.974 --> 17:23.008
until she walks                 
down the aisle!                 

17:23.143 --> 17:24.175
      How about the oven?       

17:24.243 --> 17:26.478
                          Carla!

17:26.546 --> 17:29.248
             How about          
          the dumbwaiter?       

17:29.315 --> 17:33.085
  My cousin and I used to hide  
 in there when we were little.  

17:33.153 --> 17:36.088
        Ooh. Ooh,               
    it's cozy in here.          

17:36.156 --> 17:37.356
            Woody...            

17:37.424 --> 17:38.924
                  No, don't even
                 think about it.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.292
MR. GAINES:                     
Kelly?                          

17:40.360 --> 17:41.527
Kelly?                          
            Oh, hi,             
          Mr. Gaines.           

17:41.594 --> 17:43.662
Hi, Woody. I can't              
seem to find Kelly.             

17:53.573 --> 17:55.908
She didn't go                   
out there, did she?             

17:55.975 --> 17:57.910
            I think she's around
                 here somewhere.

17:59.646 --> 18:01.513
              Woody, you haven't
        seen Kelly, have you?   

18:01.581 --> 18:02.715
Uh, no.                         
No, sir.                        

18:02.782 --> 18:04.883
No. Not me.                     
Not before the wedding.         

18:04.951 --> 18:06.885
I wouldn't want                 
to see Kelly naked.             

18:09.556 --> 18:11.990
I mean, uh, married.            

18:12.058 --> 18:14.660
I mean, I don't believe in      
 seeing her naked... marriages, 

18:14.728 --> 18:17.062
         or being naked         
    when you see a marriage,    

18:17.130 --> 18:18.630
or any of that stuff,           

18:18.698 --> 18:21.200
    not even with a... veil.    

18:22.402 --> 18:24.603
              More bourbon, Sam.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.605
    Lots more bourbon.          
Yes, sir.                       

18:26.673 --> 18:28.107
            The big bottles.    

18:30.010 --> 18:32.811
   Oh! I couldn't have held on  
to that rope much longer.       

18:32.879 --> 18:35.014
All right, I don't want         
to take any more chances here.  

18:35.081 --> 18:36.715
  You go up to your room, Kelly.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.550
                  Now, would you
                  two stop that!
                Now, come on.   

18:38.618 --> 18:40.185
            Woody, Woody, Woody,
          get out there and, uh,

18:40.253 --> 18:42.187
mingle with your,               
uh, guests. Come on.            

18:42.255 --> 18:43.155
KELLY:                          
See you later, Woody.           

18:43.356 --> 18:44.957
                 Love you.      

18:45.058 --> 18:45.891
         Love you, too.         

18:45.959 --> 18:46.925
            Love you more.      

18:47.027 --> 18:47.860
         No, you don't.         

18:47.961 --> 18:49.595
        Yes, I do, too.         
                Love you more   

18:49.662 --> 18:51.296
                than anything in
                the whole world.

18:51.364 --> 18:54.199
             Wuv you, wuv you...
    Yes, I wuv you,             
    wuv you, too, Woody.        

18:54.267 --> 18:55.834
Now, uh, you go out there       

18:55.902 --> 18:58.837
             and mingle with    
          your new in-laws, huh?

19:00.674 --> 19:02.207
  Are you a history buff, Sam?  

19:02.275 --> 19:04.043
        Uh, no, sir, I'm not,   
                  actually. Why?

19:04.110 --> 19:06.011
I was thinking                  
about Mussolini.                
                      Ah.       

19:06.079 --> 19:09.248
Oh, I know you hear a lot       
of negative things about him... 

19:09.315 --> 19:11.550
but any man that had            
his own son-in-law shot         

19:11.618 --> 19:12.918
couldn't have been all bad.     

19:14.954 --> 19:17.122
    All right, I think          
    everything's okay here.     

19:17.190 --> 19:19.625
    I'll just, uh, make sure    
 that Woody's behaving himself. 

19:22.796 --> 19:25.898
              Well, hello there.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.766
            Can I, uh, help you?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.702
(with German accent):           
I'm Cousin Monika.              

19:29.769 --> 19:32.404
        Oh. Well, I'm Uncle Sam.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.940
I need a paper towel.           

19:35.008 --> 19:38.043
I'm afraid I spilled            
a bit of wine, right here.      

19:38.111 --> 19:39.278
                Oh, really?     

19:39.379 --> 19:41.213
          Well, it doesn't show.
    It does...                  

19:41.314 --> 19:43.282
if you look closely enough.     

19:43.350 --> 19:45.317
          Oh, yes, you're right,
                by golly.       

19:45.385 --> 19:48.587
  That's a beauty-- it's too bad
you had to get a stain on it.   

19:48.655 --> 19:49.621
            Throw that to me.   

19:49.689 --> 19:50.723
        Thank you very much.    

19:50.790 --> 19:53.092
Let me, uh, get this for you.   

19:53.159 --> 19:56.462
            You're as gallant as
             you are attractive.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.297
Well, I try for an even mix.    

19:58.398 --> 20:00.733
                 Are you part of
             the groom's family?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.234
Actually, I'm the best man.     

20:02.302 --> 20:04.870
                 <i>I'd</i> enjoy being
              the judge of <i>that.</i>

20:08.208 --> 20:09.508
This is hardly                  
the time or place.              

20:09.576 --> 20:10.776
Of course, under                
the gift table                  

20:10.844 --> 20:12.578
in about half an hour           
would be all right.             

20:13.680 --> 20:15.481
There you go--                  
good as new.                    

20:15.548 --> 20:16.782
                      Thank you.

20:19.853 --> 20:22.321
     Whoa, w-wait a second,     
     what-what's your rush?     

20:22.389 --> 20:24.656
              My husband will be
                 looking for me.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.927
     Can you believe that?      
         She's married!         

20:28.995 --> 20:32.965
     She didn't seem to be      
      a fanatic about it.       

20:34.434 --> 20:35.734
REBECCA:                        
Oh, hello, Father.              

20:35.835 --> 20:37.169
Can I help you?                 

20:37.237 --> 20:38.671
              I'm Dr. Chatfield.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.172
                  I'm performing
                the ceremony.   

20:40.240 --> 20:42.007
                     (chuckles):
            I've been retired   
                        so long,

20:42.075 --> 20:44.209
    I've forgotten how tiring   
    the preliminaries can be.   

20:44.310 --> 20:47.146
            All that handshaking
              and yak, yak, yak.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.614
              Is there somewhere
                I could just sit

20:48.682 --> 20:50.282
              and put my feet up
                until it's time?

20:50.350 --> 20:51.717
    Well, sure--                
how about right over here?      

20:51.785 --> 20:54.019
CHEF:                           
Just keep him out of            
my part of the kitchen.         

20:54.087 --> 20:56.355
  I still have the whole cake   
          to decorate.          

20:56.456 --> 20:58.357
 Well, I wish you'd hurry up--  
     I'm starving to death.     

20:58.425 --> 21:00.159
         I haven't had          
a thing to eat all morning      

21:00.226 --> 21:01.360
         except one of          
     those little candies.      

21:01.428 --> 21:03.195
    What little candy?          

21:03.296 --> 21:05.497
  Those little candies shaped   
    like brides and grooms.     

21:05.565 --> 21:09.101
          I made this           
    for the top of the cake!    

21:10.337 --> 21:13.138
 You bit the head of my groom!  

21:13.206 --> 21:16.475
            I'm sorry-- I didn't
              have any idea that
                 that was for...

21:16.543 --> 21:18.243
This is the last straw!         

21:18.345 --> 21:20.946
  You have been an irritation   
ever since you walked in.       

21:21.014 --> 21:24.416
    Now, I want you...          
          out of here.          

21:24.484 --> 21:26.685
              No!               

21:26.753 --> 21:28.721
     I can stay here, too!      

21:28.788 --> 21:30.422
  I've been working very hard,  

21:30.490 --> 21:33.859
and except for eating the groom,
I've done a damn good job.      

21:35.729 --> 21:38.430
     If you don't like it,      
why don't <i>you</i> just leave!       

21:38.531 --> 21:40.065
        Very well.              

21:40.133 --> 21:41.367
        We shall.               

21:41.434 --> 21:43.168
 <i>Allons-y!</i>                      

21:43.236 --> 21:46.171
(muttering in French)           

21:46.239 --> 21:48.507
         (dogs barking,         
      growling excitedly)       

21:49.943 --> 21:51.210
        (door slamming)         

21:51.277 --> 21:52.778
                        NORM:   
                Probably not the
                smartest move   

21:52.879 --> 21:57.549
  for a bunch of guys who have  
  been handling liver all day.  

21:59.052 --> 22:00.619
            He left.            

22:00.687 --> 22:03.288
    (feigns French accent):     
     Well, you told him to!     

22:03.356 --> 22:04.890
        Yes! But nobody         
      ever listens to <i>me.</i>       

22:04.958 --> 22:06.925
     Why did he have to be      
         the first one?         

22:08.194 --> 22:09.762
 Say, is the minister out here? 

22:09.829 --> 22:10.929
They need him for a photograph. 

22:11.031 --> 22:13.032
                Right back here.
All the waiters and the chef,   

22:13.099 --> 22:14.233
how are we going                
to replace them?                

22:14.300 --> 22:15.734
          Just relax.           
 We can handle this ourselves.  

22:15.802 --> 22:17.236
          Oh, really?           
  How are we going to do that?  

22:17.303 --> 22:19.672
    We'll just do whatever those
     clowns were supposed to do.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.739
     Now, come on, listen to me.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.008
                 This is Woody's
                    wedding day.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.176
    It's the most important day 
            in his life.        

22:24.244 --> 22:25.210
    We're not going to spoil it.

22:25.278 --> 22:26.779
          Now, we'll just       
        ice the cake,           

22:26.846 --> 22:28.347
    and serve the hors d'oeuvres

22:28.415 --> 22:29.381
    and don't worry about it.   

22:29.449 --> 22:31.817
    There's no need to panic.   

22:31.885 --> 22:34.053
I think somebody better tell    
them to wait on that photograph.

22:34.120 --> 22:35.287
                 Why is that?   

22:35.388 --> 22:38.357
            Because the minister
                  is dead.      

22:52.005 --> 22:53.739
    Dead?                       

22:53.807 --> 22:55.341
    He can't                    
    be dead.                    

22:55.408 --> 22:57.142
          He just sat down there
        to take a little nap.   

22:57.210 --> 22:58.210
Frasier, are you sure?          

22:58.311 --> 22:59.311
    I trained as a physician.   

22:59.379 --> 23:00.412
          Believe me, he's dead.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.047
                  You don't make
             that mistake twice.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.783
        Oh, the poor, old thing.

23:06.219 --> 23:08.153
    Would you                   
    stop that?!                 

23:09.689 --> 23:11.690
             Aw, no, poor Woody.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.258
         There goes the wedding.

23:13.326 --> 23:14.526
Yeah, unless one                
of you knows                    

23:14.594 --> 23:16.228
an incredible                   
ventriloquist.                  

23:16.329 --> 23:18.831
                  Well, somebody
             better go tell him.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.932
You're right.                   

23:20.000 --> 23:22.468
Oh, he's just                   
going to be crushed.            

23:22.535 --> 23:23.702
  Break it to him gently, Sam.  

23:23.803 --> 23:27.072
Sam? Why am I the one           
who's responsible?              

23:27.173 --> 23:28.240
Hey, Woodrow!                   

23:28.308 --> 23:29.375
     How're you doing, man?     
     Hey!                       

23:29.442 --> 23:30.576
                          WOODY:
                    Hey, Sam.   

23:30.643 --> 23:32.211
     I just came in to get      
        my boutonniere.         

23:32.278 --> 23:34.713
Oh, he just, uh, came in        
to get his boutonniere.         

23:34.781 --> 23:37.082
             Oh.                
                Listen, I didn't
                    get a chance

23:37.150 --> 23:41.220
  to thank you guys for making  
this such a wonderful day.      

23:41.287 --> 23:43.322
Helping me out                  
with Kelly's dad.               

23:43.390 --> 23:44.823
                    Oh, well,   
                we'd do anything

23:44.891 --> 23:47.426
          we could for you, pal,
      anything humanly possible.

23:47.527 --> 23:48.961
     I know you would, Sam.     

23:49.029 --> 23:51.497
    I-I know you all would,     
    and thank you all.          

23:51.564 --> 23:55.367
 This is just the greatest day  
    of my whole life.           

23:55.435 --> 23:56.869
                    Aw, well,   
                that's terrific.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.171
         Say, how would you feel
         if we had to cancel it?

24:00.807 --> 24:01.907
     What, are you kidding?     

24:01.975 --> 24:03.776
     No way. Why would we?      

24:03.877 --> 24:06.779
     Oh, I don't know, you know,
     say the minister was, uh...

24:06.846 --> 24:08.547
    Called away.                
                    Called away.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.182
    He's retired, Sam.          

24:10.250 --> 24:12.484
        That's for sure.        

24:12.552 --> 24:14.319
  His wife died ten years ago.  

24:14.387 --> 24:15.587
  He doesn't have any family.   

24:15.655 --> 24:17.256
    From what I hear,           
 he hardly has any life at all. 

24:17.357 --> 24:18.657
        You heard right.        

24:24.130 --> 24:26.732
  Whereas, I have the greatest  
life anyone could ask for       

24:26.800 --> 24:29.068
and... you know,                

24:29.135 --> 24:30.769
      the greatest friends      

24:30.837 --> 24:35.107
 and I-I'm going to marry Kelly 
         in 30 minutes.         

24:35.175 --> 24:36.408
      And I just feel like      
        the luckiest guy        

24:36.476 --> 24:37.543
      in the whole world.       

24:37.610 --> 24:38.677
            You sure are, pal.  

24:38.745 --> 24:39.812
                Bye-bye.        

24:42.615 --> 24:44.683
                 Oh, great. What
             are we going to do?

24:44.751 --> 24:47.019
    Well, I suppose I should    
        call the police.        

24:47.087 --> 24:49.154
          Yeah, one of us better
        tell Mr. Gaines, too.   

24:49.222 --> 24:50.589
Oh, that'd be great.            

24:50.657 --> 24:53.225
What are we supposed to do,     
throw rice at the hearse?       

24:54.761 --> 24:56.095
I'm telling you,                
if we tell anybody,             

24:56.162 --> 24:57.796
they're just going to cancel    
the whole celebration.          

24:57.864 --> 25:00.399
        Rebecca's right.        

25:00.467 --> 25:02.835
    A dead body at a wedding    
         is a bad idea.         

25:02.902 --> 25:06.138
     Both times we did that     
 in my family, we regretted it. 

25:08.108 --> 25:09.908
Boy, look at him, Norm.         

25:09.976 --> 25:12.177
One minute he's here,           

25:12.245 --> 25:14.079
next minute he's gone.          

25:14.147 --> 25:15.748
Really makes you think,         
doesn't it?                     

25:17.083 --> 25:21.353
Friendship, mortality,          
the afterlife...                

25:21.421 --> 25:23.188
what's it all about?            

25:23.256 --> 25:25.190
That's a nice watch             
he's wearing.                   

25:29.329 --> 25:31.730
              No. No, Cliff, no.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.633
I'm just saying, is all.        

25:34.701 --> 25:36.402
Wait a minute.                  
Wait, wait, wait.               

25:36.469 --> 25:37.770
Didn't Woody say something like 

25:37.837 --> 25:39.405
          this old man          
 didn't have any friends left?  

25:39.472 --> 25:40.606
Well, what harm                 
would it be                     

25:40.674 --> 25:42.408
if we just didn't tell          
anybody for a few hours?        

25:42.475 --> 25:44.209
         What are we going to do
            with Father Bye-Bye?

25:44.310 --> 25:46.111
          Who's going to perform
                the ceremony?   

25:46.179 --> 25:47.479
Well, Kelly said something      
about having                    

25:47.547 --> 25:48.714
an uncle who's a minister.      

25:48.782 --> 25:49.648
     Uncle Roger!               

25:49.716 --> 25:50.883
     Great! Okay.               

25:50.950 --> 25:52.217
  Cliffie, go find Uncle Roger  

25:52.285 --> 25:53.419
and bring him in here.          
             Roger!             

25:53.486 --> 25:55.120
That's what                     
I just said.                    

25:55.188 --> 25:56.455
Go, go-go-go.                   

25:56.523 --> 25:59.291
Frasier, uh, go stall           
while I send out more drinks.   

25:59.359 --> 26:02.194
 Uh, Norm, Carla, get the body  
in the wine cellar there.       

26:02.262 --> 26:04.730
Uh, Rebecca, ice the cake.      

26:04.798 --> 26:08.500
        (whining):              
      Why do I always get       
        the hard part?!         

26:08.568 --> 26:10.903
              Just do it,       
            will you please?    

26:10.970 --> 26:12.604
Come on, come on.               
Hurry up.                       

26:14.107 --> 26:15.507
                 Can you believe
                    this, Carla?

26:15.575 --> 26:17.943
          We're actually putting
a dead body in a wine closet.   

26:18.011 --> 26:19.978
  Honey, if I had a nickel...   

26:21.581 --> 26:22.581
          We're lucky.          

26:22.649 --> 26:24.717
      Maurice already left      
        the icing here,         

26:24.784 --> 26:26.385
  so maybe I can do this cake.  

26:26.453 --> 26:27.653
But what am I going to do       

26:27.721 --> 26:28.987
about the little                
figure for the top?             

26:29.055 --> 26:30.422
        Uh, can't you repair it?

26:30.590 --> 26:32.358
                    Uh, here,   
                 yeah, use this.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.659
    Sam, that's pate.           

26:33.727 --> 26:35.527
You want me to make the groom's 
    head out of meat?           

26:35.595 --> 26:37.029
            Why not?            
It's supposed to be Woody.      

26:40.166 --> 26:42.201
             CLIFF:             
          Sammy, Sam.           

26:42.268 --> 26:44.136
                Uh, Uncle Roger.

26:44.204 --> 26:46.839
    Oh! Hello, Uncle Roger!     

26:46.906 --> 26:48.741
          Very pleased          
    to meet you, Sam!           

26:48.808 --> 26:52.578
      I've heard wonderful      
    things about you.           

26:52.645 --> 26:54.346
              Who are you again?

26:54.414 --> 26:55.814
Well, I'm the best man, sir.    

26:55.882 --> 26:57.883
We were wondering if you        
could help us out here          

26:57.951 --> 26:59.585
and perform Kelly               
and Woody's wedding.            

26:59.652 --> 27:01.387
    I'd be flattered!           

27:01.454 --> 27:03.422
        I love weddings.        

27:03.490 --> 27:07.559
      Yeah, they're such a      
    marvelous, young couple.    

27:07.627 --> 27:08.861
        Do I know them?         

27:11.965 --> 27:14.233
Uh, quick,                      
black coffee, Norm.             

27:14.300 --> 27:15.734
      I love black coffee!      

27:17.103 --> 27:19.038
Black coffee is marvelous!      

27:19.105 --> 27:21.540
          But you know          
  what's even more marvelous?   

27:21.608 --> 27:23.208
        Oh, yeah.               

27:23.276 --> 27:24.843
Oh, here we go.                 

27:24.911 --> 27:26.412
    Here we go. There.          

27:27.580 --> 27:29.748
    Okay, Uncle Roger,          
         this is Norm.          

27:29.816 --> 27:31.517
          He's going to help you
        prepare your remarks.   

27:31.584 --> 27:32.685
Pleased to meet you, Norm.      

27:32.752 --> 27:35.621
      I've heard marvelous      
    things about you!           

27:35.689 --> 27:38.590
        Uh, Cliffie, uh,        
serve some hors d'oeuvres.      

27:38.658 --> 27:39.758
Keep people happy,              
will you?                       

27:39.826 --> 27:41.527
        Very good.              

27:41.594 --> 27:43.028
     What's taking so long?     

27:43.096 --> 27:44.530
        Shouldn't the wedding   
            have started by now?

27:44.597 --> 27:46.699
Uh, well, something             
came up, Lilith. I'm afraid     

27:46.766 --> 27:48.100
I can't go into it, but, uh,    

27:48.168 --> 27:49.902
maybe it'd be a good idea       
if you went out there           

27:49.969 --> 27:51.337
and, you know,                  
were to sing and dance          

27:51.404 --> 27:53.806
and use some of your natural    
talents to entertain people.    

27:53.873 --> 27:56.175
                Oh, my God,     
                someone died,   
                didn't they?    

28:01.448 --> 28:02.981
    You can count on me, Sam.   

28:03.049 --> 28:05.050
                Good heavens,   
             death at a wedding.

28:05.118 --> 28:07.019
                  How appalling.

28:10.824 --> 28:12.458
      All right, see? Huh?      

28:12.525 --> 28:14.860
    No need to panic.           
Everything's under control here.

28:16.463 --> 28:17.830
                     <i>Du dort!</i>   

28:17.897 --> 28:21.333
              <i>Ich glaube Du bist</i>
          <i>der nachdem ich suche.</i>

28:21.401 --> 28:22.735
Pardon me?                      

28:22.802 --> 28:24.803
     <i>Ich will nicht, dass Sie</i>   
     <i>mit meiner Frau flirten!</i>   

28:24.871 --> 28:25.871
"Frau, frau," that's German.    

28:25.939 --> 28:27.072
Anybody speak German?           

28:27.140 --> 28:28.607
     Just the basics, Sam.      

28:28.675 --> 28:30.843
Uh, "Lowenbrau, Michelob,       
          bratwurst."           

28:32.512 --> 28:33.445
Ah, good,                       

28:33.513 --> 28:34.880
                good, good.     
                Here we go.     
                Here we go.     

28:37.317 --> 28:42.788
(loudly):                       
I wanted to take German         
in high school!                 

28:42.856 --> 28:47.126
It <i>really</i> interested me!        

28:47.193 --> 28:51.897
But it conflicted               
with Driver's Ed!               

28:53.733 --> 28:56.201
         Anything, huh?         

28:56.269 --> 28:59.271
     <i>Gehe wieder an sie heran</i>   
      <i>und Du kannst fuer den Tod</i>

28:59.339 --> 29:00.639
             <i>eines Hundes beten!</i>

29:00.707 --> 29:02.775
 Yeah, <i>well, Ich bin</i>            
 <i>ein</i> Berliner, pal.             

29:02.842 --> 29:04.043
Listen, I'm sorry.              
I can't help you.               

29:04.110 --> 29:05.511
Sam,                            
    What?                       

29:05.578 --> 29:06.712
      I think he's saying       
he needs to go to the bathroom. 

29:06.780 --> 29:08.480
    Oh, I bet you're right.     
        I'm sorry.              

29:08.548 --> 29:09.982
    Right through the doors     
    there, Goldfinger.          

29:10.984 --> 29:12.117
            Dieter!             

29:12.185 --> 29:15.054
          <i>Du bist gewamt worden!</i>

29:15.121 --> 29:16.588
Hey, how you doing, Monika?     

29:16.656 --> 29:19.525
        I'm sorry.              
  Was my husband being a pest?  

29:19.592 --> 29:20.859
Your husband?                   

29:20.927 --> 29:22.961
Oh, listen, when we met,        
I didn't know you were married, 

29:23.029 --> 29:24.329
let alone                       
to the Kaiser there.            

29:24.397 --> 29:26.031
        Oh, pay no mind.        

29:26.099 --> 29:28.200
          He's hideously jealous

29:28.268 --> 29:30.536
            of every man I am   
                 even polite to.

29:30.603 --> 29:33.005
Well, maybe you're              
just too darn polite.           

29:33.073 --> 29:35.140
            The reason I came   
        looking for you, Sam,   

29:35.208 --> 29:37.843
                  is to give you
                  a little gift.

29:37.911 --> 29:39.078
Oh, oh, yeah.                   

29:39.145 --> 29:40.746
Listen, you didn't              
have to do that.                

29:40.814 --> 29:43.882
     Consider it a down payment.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.517
            MONIKA:             
     Now I have a problem.      

29:45.585 --> 29:48.220
            My legs are cold.   

29:48.288 --> 29:50.289
              How do you think  
            I can warm them up? 

29:50.357 --> 29:51.924
Well, if you were               
a cricket,                      

29:51.991 --> 29:53.692
you could always                
rub them together.              

29:53.760 --> 29:54.860
(Sam and Monika laughing)       

29:54.928 --> 29:57.096
 Don't tease me, Sam.           

29:57.163 --> 29:59.365
I'll be expecting you...        

29:59.432 --> 30:03.035
                 unless you need
              another incentive.

30:03.103 --> 30:05.104
No-no-no-no-no,                 
no more incentive.              
No-no-no.                       

30:05.171 --> 30:07.006
Thank you very much.            

30:07.073 --> 30:08.574
 Oh, Lord, what am I gonna do?  

30:10.076 --> 30:11.377
                     Hey, buddy.
              How are you doing?

30:11.444 --> 30:13.178
Oh, hey, Sam.                   
I'm missing her.                

30:13.246 --> 30:15.014
I want to go up                 
and say "hi" to her.            

30:15.081 --> 30:17.683
      Ah, no, no. Can't you keep
          your hormones in check
          just for five minutes?

30:17.751 --> 30:19.284
      Look who's talking!       

30:19.352 --> 30:21.387
                 Aw, yeah.      

30:21.454 --> 30:23.555
          You got me there, pal.

30:23.623 --> 30:25.057
        You be careful!         

30:25.125 --> 30:28.093
          (chuckling):          
     Boy, Sammy, you ought      
    to see Lilith out there.    

30:28.161 --> 30:29.661
She's really working up a sweat,

30:29.729 --> 30:31.730
singing, dancing,               
doing impressions!              

30:31.798 --> 30:34.066
She's doing everything          
but playing the spoons!         

30:34.134 --> 30:35.334
          I'm cooking.          

30:36.736 --> 30:38.237
    Give me an A-flat.          

30:39.439 --> 30:40.806
        Thank you.              

30:40.874 --> 30:42.074
    (spoons clacking)           
    ¶ When you're smiling ¶     

30:42.142 --> 30:44.076
    ¶ When you're smiling ¶     

30:44.144 --> 30:46.712
 ¶ The whole world smiles... ¶  

30:46.780 --> 30:49.682
  You know, maybe it wouldn't   
be so bad to let them see       

30:49.749 --> 30:51.650
the corpse after all, eh?       

30:51.718 --> 30:53.352
                Oh, Uncle Roger!

30:53.420 --> 30:54.553
      You feeling better?       

30:54.621 --> 30:56.255
Well, well, yes,                
I am feeling better.            

30:56.322 --> 30:57.489
                    Ah, good.   

30:57.557 --> 30:58.757
                  You feeling up
                to performing   
                      a wedding?

30:58.825 --> 30:59.658
    Perform a wedding?          

30:59.726 --> 31:01.093
      I'd sooner be dead.       

31:01.161 --> 31:03.495
      Oh, now, now, don't,      
 don't you get started on this. 

31:03.563 --> 31:04.963
        I hate weddings.        

31:05.031 --> 31:08.300
     Well, my own marriage      
    was a, a disaster.          

31:08.368 --> 31:10.769
I-I-I... at times               
I prayed I would die            

31:10.837 --> 31:14.006
and go to a better hell         
than the one I was living.      

31:14.074 --> 31:16.075
          Oh, my... Just talk to
            him, will you, Norm?

31:16.142 --> 31:18.077
      What am I gonna do,       
      argue with the man?       

31:20.413 --> 31:24.616
Marriage ruined my life!        
Oh, Norm, Norm,                 

31:24.684 --> 31:26.185
if you only knew.               

31:26.252 --> 31:27.586
      Amen, brother, amen.      

31:27.654 --> 31:29.154
            Not now, Cliffie!   

31:29.222 --> 31:30.189
Uh, do me a favor.              

31:30.256 --> 31:31.423
                Take Uncle Roger
                      out there.

31:31.491 --> 31:33.592
        Find Frasier and        
get him some therapy fast.      

31:33.660 --> 31:35.527
            Sure thing. Okay,   
            buddy boy, let's go.

31:35.595 --> 31:36.528
        Are you married?        

31:36.596 --> 31:37.763
Uh, no, sir, I'm not.           

31:37.831 --> 31:38.864
Came close once,                
but no.                         

31:38.932 --> 31:40.532
  Well, she was a lucky girl.   

31:40.600 --> 31:42.368
Why, thank you, sir.            

31:42.435 --> 31:45.971
    What's the holdup?          
     Where's Dr. Chatfield?     

31:46.039 --> 31:51.143
    Uh, Dr. Chatfield,          
    um, has, uh, challenged     

31:51.211 --> 31:56.348
the chef and the waiters        
to a footrace in the park,      

31:56.416 --> 31:57.516
and that's where                
they are now, footracing.       

31:57.584 --> 31:59.685
      Thank you very much.      
He was going for it.            

32:01.254 --> 32:02.721
Sir, uh, the minister           
should be ready                 

32:02.789 --> 32:03.889
in about five minutes.          

32:03.957 --> 32:05.591
            Well, then I'll just
            use this opportunity

32:05.658 --> 32:07.626
            to get the champagne
         out of the wine closet.

32:07.694 --> 32:08.627
         Oh, good idea.         

32:08.695 --> 32:11.030
Uh, everybody loves wine,       
            Rebecca.            

32:11.097 --> 32:12.998
                            SAM:
                         No! No!

32:13.066 --> 32:15.100
             Please, this is far
                  too dangerous.

32:15.168 --> 32:16.568
                  Let me go down
                  there for you.

32:16.636 --> 32:18.137
         I'm just gonna         
    select a vintage.           

32:18.204 --> 32:20.873
            Rebecca, can you sew
             a button on for me?

32:20.940 --> 32:24.009
Kelly, what are you doing       
down here in the kitchen?       

32:24.077 --> 32:26.245
     Now that you're here,      
let me get a look at you.       

32:26.312 --> 32:28.847
             Oh, yes, yes, let's
                all look at her.

32:28.915 --> 32:31.350
     Kelly, you stand right over
      there by the pâté. Oh! Oh!

32:31.418 --> 32:35.988
            (gasps)             
  Isn't... she... beautiful?!   

32:36.056 --> 32:37.222
                            SAM:
                  Yes, yes, yes.

32:37.290 --> 32:38.724
     I'm just a bartender,      

32:38.792 --> 32:40.859
 but even a dumbwaiter like me  
 can see how beautiful she is.  

32:40.927 --> 32:42.594
  Oh, look at her, Mr. Gaines.  

32:42.662 --> 32:45.931
      Turn around, Kelly.       
      Look at that dress!       

32:45.999 --> 32:48.667
Look at that hair!              

32:48.735 --> 32:51.170
      Look at that train!       

32:51.237 --> 32:52.438
             Well,              

32:52.505 --> 32:53.906
      you're just a little      
     store-bought princess,     

32:54.040 --> 32:55.207
    aren't you, Kelly?          

32:57.377 --> 32:59.111
                     Oh, Cliffy!
                         Cliffy!

32:59.179 --> 33:00.913
Ah, you're                      
just in time.                   

33:00.980 --> 33:02.514
  Yeah, the bride and her father
    would like to have a shot   

33:02.582 --> 33:03.649
             before the wedding!

33:03.717 --> 33:05.451
        Oh, yeah,               
    sure thing there, Sammy.    

33:05.518 --> 33:07.419
Okay, now just look at me.      

33:07.487 --> 33:08.687
Uh, just look at Cliff.         

33:08.755 --> 33:10.856
        I already hired         
  a professional photographer.  

33:10.924 --> 33:13.425
I know, but spontaneous         
is so much more fun. Smile!     

33:13.493 --> 33:14.059
    (camera shutter clicks)     

33:14.127 --> 33:14.760
              Oh!               
                        Yeah!   

33:16.429 --> 33:17.529
                  SAM:          
             Oh, oh! Coming     
             through, sir.      

33:17.597 --> 33:18.997
            Coming through.     

33:19.065 --> 33:21.767
    Okay. Here we go. Let's     
get another one this way.       

33:21.835 --> 33:24.269
             CLIFF:             
  Yeah, good idea. We'll, uh,   
    spin right around here,     

33:24.337 --> 33:25.771
                    Turn around.
and I'll get                    
a picture                       

33:25.839 --> 33:27.740
of your baby blues.             
    Oh! You blinded me          

33:27.807 --> 33:28.974
with that                       
damn flashbulb.                 

33:29.042 --> 33:30.709
Will you be reasonable?!        

33:30.777 --> 33:33.112
             I tell you, I won't
        perform another wedding.

33:33.179 --> 33:34.613
    (shutter clicking)          
    What the devil was that?    

33:34.748 --> 33:36.348
Uh... maybe it                  
was the radio.                  

33:36.416 --> 33:37.383
                 Oh, yeah.      

33:37.450 --> 33:38.684
    Turn off that damn radio!   

33:38.752 --> 33:39.818
                      I've got a
             splitting headache.

33:39.886 --> 33:41.153
        I'm gonna go upstairs   
                and lie down.   

33:41.221 --> 33:43.022
    No, sir. You gotta          
      pick a vintage here       

33:43.089 --> 33:45.357
                 so we can      
              drink champagne.  

33:45.425 --> 33:47.026
        Do you eat a lot        
         of sugar, Sam?         

33:47.093 --> 33:49.561
            No, sir, I'm just   
            a fool for weddings.

33:49.629 --> 33:50.596
    What are you doing          

33:50.663 --> 33:51.597
dressed like that? Come on.     

33:51.664 --> 33:53.232
Mr. Gaines could see            
you. Get out there.             

33:53.299 --> 33:54.366
         (dogs barking)         

33:55.535 --> 33:57.803
I still need to have            
my button sewed on.             

33:57.871 --> 34:01.273
Woody was kidding around,       
 and he kind of... bit it off.  

34:01.341 --> 34:03.075
                  Where is the  
                  button, Kelly?

34:03.143 --> 34:04.143
      Well, Woody has it.       

34:04.210 --> 34:05.744
              SAM:              
I got it. I got it. Woody!      

34:05.812 --> 34:06.945
  (dogs barking and growling)   

34:08.313 --> 34:09.348
      Oh, my God.               

34:09.416 --> 34:10.983
             Give me the button.
                 There you go.  

34:11.051 --> 34:12.016
         (dogs barking)         

34:14.054 --> 34:14.987
         Here, Rebecca.         

34:15.054 --> 34:16.121
    Sew it on, quick.           

34:16.188 --> 34:17.322
    Sam, I'm icing the cake.    

34:17.389 --> 34:18.556
  If I weren't icing the cake,  

34:18.625 --> 34:19.992
         I would sew on         
    the damned button,          

34:20.060 --> 34:21.060
    but I am icing the cake.    

34:21.127 --> 34:22.995
                You don't know  
             how to sew, do you?

34:23.063 --> 34:25.464
     I don't even know how      
    to ice the damned cake.     

34:27.400 --> 34:28.434
        I can sew.              

34:30.503 --> 34:32.670
        Yeah, Ma thought        
         it was a skill         

34:32.739 --> 34:33.806
 every young man should learn.  

34:33.873 --> 34:36.108
    Oh, that was very           
        sensible of her.        

34:36.176 --> 34:39.712
Oh, sure, I can also knit,      
    crochet and do bargello.    

34:39.779 --> 34:41.179
        You ought to see        
      this petit-point rug      

34:41.246 --> 34:44.183
            I did of John Wayne 
          ascending into heaven.

34:44.250 --> 34:46.351
         (dogs barking)         

34:47.253 --> 34:49.355
        (gasping):              
        Big dogs.               

34:49.422 --> 34:50.356
Big, hungry dogs.               

34:50.422 --> 34:52.324
    Thank God, I'm saved.       

34:52.391 --> 34:53.292
    Sam, here we are.           

34:53.360 --> 34:54.827
         (dogs barking)         

34:54.893 --> 34:57.363
Well, that's quite a pair       
of dogs you got there, sir.     

34:57.430 --> 34:59.031
Thank you. This ought to do it. 

34:59.099 --> 35:00.232
  Put those on ice for later.   

35:00.300 --> 35:01.433
     On ice, sir. Yes, sir.     

35:01.501 --> 35:03.068
I wonder how Lilith             
is doing out there.             

35:03.136 --> 35:05.571
            LILITH:             
         And this time,         
     just the women yodel.      

35:06.806 --> 35:09.308
  (dogs barking and growling)   

35:11.044 --> 35:12.211
Here you go,                    
Mr. Best Man.                   

35:12.278 --> 35:13.645
Thank you very much.            

35:13.713 --> 35:14.847
My pants are torn.              

35:14.914 --> 35:15.981
        Oh, I'm sorry, Woody.   

35:16.049 --> 35:17.316
              Uh, Kelly's father
                  was down here.

35:17.384 --> 35:19.385
        Listen, why don't you   
    run up to her room there?   

35:19.452 --> 35:21.020
            Uh, Cliffie's sewing
            on a button for her.

35:21.087 --> 35:22.654
            Maybe he can take   
             care of your pants.

35:22.722 --> 35:24.390
     You'd think those dogs     
     would know me by now.      

35:24.457 --> 35:26.725
Mr. Gaines is always giving them
one of my shoes to sniff.       

35:28.762 --> 35:30.529
Quick, quick, haul him up.      

35:30.597 --> 35:32.164
Okay, now,                      

35:32.232 --> 35:34.667
     if we can get the body     
  in the wine cellar, and, uh,  

35:34.734 --> 35:36.669
          and Frasier           
      to fix Uncle Roger,       

35:36.736 --> 35:38.203
  and Rebecca to fix the cake,  

35:38.271 --> 35:40.205
        and Lilith              
    to entertain the guests     

35:40.273 --> 35:43.075
and Cliffie to fix Woody's      
  pants and we'll be all set.   

35:43.143 --> 35:45.678
  Sammy, I hate to be the one   
     to break this to you,      

35:45.745 --> 35:46.879
         but the, uh, body seems

35:46.946 --> 35:49.214
              to have fallen off
                 the dumbwaiter.

35:49.282 --> 35:50.416
    Aw, gee.                    

35:50.483 --> 35:52.017
Just when everything            
was going so well.              

36:05.699 --> 36:06.699
     The body's gone, Sam.      

36:06.766 --> 36:08.334
Well, we're just                
gonna have to find it           

36:08.401 --> 36:09.501
before somebody else does.      

36:09.569 --> 36:12.604
"Horoscopes are                 
for suckers, Carla."            

36:12.672 --> 36:15.207
Hey, does anyone know           
where this dumbwaiter goes?     

36:15.275 --> 36:16.642
      The cellar, I think.      

36:16.710 --> 36:18.811
        Robin and I were        
    going to have one,          

36:18.878 --> 36:20.979
     right off the kitchen      
    by the inglenook,           

36:21.047 --> 36:22.981
      those little leaded       
         glass windows,         

36:23.049 --> 36:26.652
     overlooking the little     
          herb garden.          

36:26.720 --> 36:29.321
  I'd love it if he were dead.  

36:31.024 --> 36:32.324
            Okay, tell you what.

36:32.392 --> 36:34.526
             Go outside there,  
             see if you can find

36:34.594 --> 36:35.661
                  the entrance  
                  to the cellar.

36:35.729 --> 36:37.196
    No problem, Sammy.          

36:37.263 --> 36:38.530
         (dogs barking)         

36:38.598 --> 36:39.832
        Problem, Sammy.         

36:39.899 --> 36:41.667
All right, all right, all right.

36:41.735 --> 36:43.002
                Plan B. Uh...   

36:43.069 --> 36:44.770
    All right, somebody climb   
          in the dumbwaiter here

36:44.838 --> 36:46.038
              and, uh, I'll     
              lower you down.   
Okay.                           

36:46.106 --> 36:48.073
                  Okey-doke.    

36:48.141 --> 36:50.009
                    No, uh...   

36:50.076 --> 36:52.011
    Just a thought, but maybe   
        Carla should go, huh?   

36:52.078 --> 36:54.747
    Oh, sure, sure. I'd love    
    to be lowered down          

36:54.814 --> 36:55.981
into the cellar on a rope       

36:56.049 --> 36:57.850
    to look for a dead          
    body in the dark.           

36:57.917 --> 36:59.818
  Who believes in horoscopes?   

37:00.920 --> 37:02.321
    Are you there yet?          

37:02.489 --> 37:03.756
Uh, a little more!              

37:03.823 --> 37:05.424
            Hello, Uncle Sam.   

37:05.492 --> 37:07.159
        (Carla screams,         
          heavy thud)           

37:09.329 --> 37:11.964
                  As long as you
              have my stockings,

37:12.032 --> 37:13.532
            I thought you might 
            need something to...

37:13.600 --> 37:14.967
                 hold them up.  

37:15.035 --> 37:18.137
  Oh, uh, gee, I-I wish, uh--   
    not now, not now.           

37:19.839 --> 37:21.507
No, look, this is               
wrong. Listen.                  

37:21.574 --> 37:22.741
This is my buddy's              
wedding today.                  

37:22.809 --> 37:23.742
I can't spoil it.               

37:23.810 --> 37:25.511
Besides, I have certain         
moral standards                 

37:25.578 --> 37:27.646
 that I just refuse             
to compromise.                  

37:27.714 --> 37:28.914
        Right after the wedding,

37:28.982 --> 37:33.986
        my poor husband has     
        to fly to Dusseldorf.   

37:34.054 --> 37:35.521
 Okay, but I'm                  
 buying breakfast.              

37:39.926 --> 37:41.660
 I don't feel good about this.  

37:41.728 --> 37:43.529
      But I've felt a lot       
    worse in the past.          

37:45.098 --> 37:46.999
        Carla, honey, I'm sorry!

37:47.067 --> 37:48.667
That wasn't                     
funny, Sammy!                   

37:48.735 --> 37:49.868
          Have you got the body?

37:49.936 --> 37:51.003
Yes. Now pull us up.            

37:51.071 --> 37:52.638
        All right. Here we come.

37:52.706 --> 37:54.206
                     Here we go.

37:54.274 --> 37:55.207
                      I see you.

37:55.275 --> 37:56.508
    What are you doing, Sam?    

37:56.576 --> 37:57.576
              Ooh!              

37:57.644 --> 37:58.577
(Carla screams, loud thud)      

38:00.080 --> 38:01.580
          Nothing. Nothing. Why?

38:01.648 --> 38:03.615
I need a bandage                
for Mr. Clavin.                 

38:03.683 --> 38:05.284
He pricked his finger           
sewing my button on,            

38:05.352 --> 38:07.152
and he's being a                
real baby about it.             

38:07.220 --> 38:08.287
     Apparently, his mother     

38:08.355 --> 38:11.490
    used to tell him bedtime    
    stories about gangrene.     

38:12.559 --> 38:13.625
             Carla!             

38:13.693 --> 38:14.593
SAM:                            
Honey!                          
          No, no, no!           

38:14.661 --> 38:15.828
    I'm not listening.          

38:15.895 --> 38:17.329
                  Roger, please!

38:17.397 --> 38:19.431
             I'm a psychiatrist.
             You're a minister. 

38:19.499 --> 38:20.632
    We're both professional men.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.968
        We're in the business   
              of helping people.

38:23.036 --> 38:24.737
          Don't make me hit you!

38:24.804 --> 38:26.939
I am not going                  
near that wedding.              

38:27.007 --> 38:28.407
      Oh, Sam, I give up.       

38:28.475 --> 38:29.675
        I've tried every        
         known therapy.         

38:29.743 --> 38:31.543
  This man is beyond the help   
      of medical science.       

38:31.611 --> 38:32.745
I don't                         
understand this.                

38:32.812 --> 38:35.881
I mean, he, he was perfectly    
happy when he was drunk.        

38:35.949 --> 38:37.649
            Calling Dr. Daniels.

38:37.717 --> 38:39.118
    Dr. Jack Daniels.           

38:43.256 --> 38:45.324
  Carla?! Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

38:45.392 --> 38:46.792
You are a dead                  
man, Malone.                    

38:46.860 --> 38:47.993
        I'm sorry, honey.       

38:48.061 --> 38:49.428
            I-I'm gonna pull you
            up right now.       

38:49.496 --> 38:51.363
        Hey, you want to give   
        me a hand here, Norm?   

38:51.431 --> 38:52.931
                 No, no, no, no.

38:52.999 --> 38:54.199
                  With the body.

38:54.267 --> 38:56.101
        I gotta get the minister
        into the wine closet.   

38:56.169 --> 38:57.436
You know, this guy              
didn't move around              

38:57.504 --> 38:58.771
that much when                  
he was alive.                   

39:00.407 --> 39:01.707
                     I'm sorry, 
                     sweetheart.

39:01.775 --> 39:03.542
          Oh, no, no,           
     don't apologize, Sam.      

39:03.610 --> 39:05.277
  Your dropping me was funny,   

39:05.345 --> 39:07.346
    and then the second time    
        was hysterical.         

39:07.414 --> 39:09.682
     Then this third time,      
      I said to myself...       

39:09.749 --> 39:10.416
        (yelling)               

39:11.251 --> 39:12.017
          (screaming)           

39:12.085 --> 39:13.919
                          (thud)
                       <i>Sie dort!</i>

39:13.987 --> 39:15.287
           <i>Ich habe Dich gewart.</i>

39:15.355 --> 39:17.489
                 <i>Nun wirst Du</i>   
             <i>dafuer bezahlen!</i>   

39:17.557 --> 39:19.224
      No, no, no. Frasier,      
      do you speak German?      

39:19.292 --> 39:22.861
     <i>Ich werde dich wie ein</i>     
 <i>gefeseltes Schwein multilieren.</i>

39:22.929 --> 39:24.697
             Well, I picked up a
smattering during med school,   

39:24.764 --> 39:25.831
          but it's been so long.

39:25.899 --> 39:28.967
             I did recognize the
        word "mutilate," though.

39:29.035 --> 39:31.970
         <i>Das ist nicht Alles was</i>
           <i>ich abschlagen werde.</i>

39:33.473 --> 39:34.973
              He speaks too fast
                    for me, Sam,

39:35.041 --> 39:36.842
    but I can tell you this--   
            he's clearly insane.

39:36.910 --> 39:38.110
                  Good with a   
                  sword, though.

39:38.178 --> 39:39.978
            Tell him I didn't   
            touch his wife.     

39:40.046 --> 39:41.180
             <i>Bitte.</i>             

39:41.247 --> 39:43.182
         <i>Es ist ein, er, Fehler.</i>

39:43.249 --> 39:44.650
                  <i>Dieser ist der</i>
                 <i>falsche Mann.</i>  

39:44.718 --> 39:46.552
 <i>Der falsche Mann?</i>              
                       <i>Yah.</i>     

39:46.619 --> 39:49.355
 Oh, good. Now, please tell him 
     to put his sword away.     

39:49.422 --> 39:50.989
              <i>Er ist unschuldig.</i>

39:51.057 --> 39:52.324
              <i>Tut ihm nicht weh.</i>

39:54.027 --> 39:56.195
  Oh. Oh. Thank you, Frasier.   

39:56.262 --> 39:57.663
     Whew! Boy, I tell you,     

39:57.731 --> 39:59.832
        I thought I was         
      a dead man for sure.      

39:59.899 --> 40:00.933
 <i>Du Schmutiziges Schwin!</i>        

40:01.001 --> 40:02.468
        No. No, no, no.         

40:02.535 --> 40:04.336
        These are mine.         
    Yeah, yeah, see I, uh...    

40:04.404 --> 40:06.505
      surgical condition--      
    poor circulation.           

40:06.573 --> 40:08.674
              Yeah, oh, oh, that
              feels much better.

40:08.742 --> 40:10.976
         You know, actually, uh,
         that does feel better. 

40:12.412 --> 40:15.781
              (howling laughter)

40:15.849 --> 40:18.117
         <i>Er ist bestimmt</i>        
     <i>der falsche Mann.</i>          

40:18.184 --> 40:19.752
      <i>Er ist ein "Poofter."</i>     

40:19.819 --> 40:21.353
         (all laughing)         

40:21.421 --> 40:23.689
Well, I tried to tell you.      

40:23.757 --> 40:25.357
             <i>Ein "Poofter."</i>     

40:25.425 --> 40:28.227
   <i>Hoert Alle, der beste Mann</i>   
      <i>ist ein "Poofter..."</i>      

40:28.294 --> 40:29.361
                     (guffawing)

40:29.429 --> 40:31.563
 <i>Ich bein "Poofter."</i>            

40:31.631 --> 40:32.965
         <i>Ein "Poofter!"</i>         

40:33.033 --> 40:34.700
                      (laughing)

40:34.768 --> 40:36.468
            What's a <i>Poofter</i>    
                mean, anyway?   

40:36.536 --> 40:38.070
     Well, it means you'll      
      never have to worry       

40:38.138 --> 40:39.471
 about the German draft board.  

40:39.539 --> 40:41.640
  Oh, Lord. At the very least,  

40:41.708 --> 40:43.042
                I thought I     
                was gonna get   

40:43.109 --> 40:45.044
            the living daylights
            kicked out of me.   

40:45.111 --> 40:46.612
      The night is young.       

40:46.680 --> 40:47.613
              Ooh!              

40:47.681 --> 40:49.648
        (screams, thud)         

40:49.716 --> 40:50.783
      Sammy, you're gonna       
        have to let her         

40:50.850 --> 40:51.850
 out of there sooner or later.  

40:51.918 --> 40:53.786
    Yeah, yeah, later.          
    Much, much later.           

40:55.121 --> 40:58.390
      For crying out loud.      
          $72 million           

40:58.458 --> 41:00.926
     and they can't afford      
      a bottle of Bactine.      

41:00.994 --> 41:02.594
I tell you,                     

41:02.662 --> 41:03.996
if I lose this finger,          

41:04.064 --> 41:06.231
this house and everything in it 
     is gonna belong to me.     

41:06.299 --> 41:07.566
Just remind me                  

41:07.634 --> 41:09.635
      to call my attorney       
 after the wedding, all right?  

41:09.703 --> 41:12.137
    Wedding? I love weddings.   

41:12.205 --> 41:13.772
             Oh...              

41:13.840 --> 41:14.907
      Well, in that case,       

41:14.974 --> 41:16.542
    how would you like          
    to perform the ceremony?    

41:16.609 --> 41:18.677
I can do better than that.      

41:18.745 --> 41:21.213
  I will perform the ceremony!  

41:24.918 --> 41:26.218
So, where's Woody, anyway?      

41:26.286 --> 41:27.553
     Oh, he's upstairs          
     with Kelly. Yeah.          

41:27.620 --> 41:29.621
I-I was beginning to feel       
like a third wheel. Yeah.       

41:29.689 --> 41:30.456
      Do you want to give       
        me a hand here?         

41:32.692 --> 41:34.693
Why are we the only people      
      who find that funny?      

41:37.097 --> 41:38.964
    Well, all right, Roger,     
shall we get going there?       

41:39.032 --> 41:40.232
                        Mm.     

41:40.300 --> 41:42.301
                Not so fast!    

41:42.369 --> 41:45.070
Can't I get a chance            
to kiss the bride?              

41:45.138 --> 41:46.705
No, no. Not now.                

41:46.773 --> 41:49.041
Plenty of time for that         
after the wedding.              

41:49.109 --> 41:52.344
        Yeah. Y-You know, I,    
        I'm somewhat sloshed.   

41:52.412 --> 41:53.812
Yes, well, it'll be             
our little secret.              

41:53.880 --> 41:55.147
              Yes, you're right.

41:55.215 --> 41:56.615
                          ROGER:
                Black coffee.   

41:56.683 --> 41:59.985
Quick. I need a blindfold       
and three sharp cleavers.       

42:02.055 --> 42:02.988
  Lilith, you don't need that.  

42:03.056 --> 42:04.123
 The wedding's about to begin.  

42:04.190 --> 42:06.425
     Like hell. Not before      
         my big finish.         

42:10.764 --> 42:12.531
Okay. Looks like we're all set. 

42:12.599 --> 42:13.565
     Where's Woody, anyway?     

42:13.633 --> 42:15.200
Oh, God. He's                   
upstairs with Kelly             

42:15.268 --> 42:16.869
working up another smile.       
             What?              

42:16.936 --> 42:19.471
 Finally,  we seem to be ready  
     to start the wedding.      

42:19.539 --> 42:20.606
I'll go upstairs and get Kelly. 

42:20.674 --> 42:21.807
    Oh, no, no,                 
    no. Mr. Gaines.             

42:21.875 --> 42:23.876
      Right, Sam, and you       
    get Woody. Let's do it.     

42:23.943 --> 42:25.210
                  All right now,
                you go upstairs,

42:25.278 --> 42:27.012
                  Mr. Gaines, to
                  Kelly's room!!

42:27.080 --> 42:30.149
  Sam, please. You're yelling   
 loud enough to wake the dead.  

42:30.216 --> 42:32.584
Oh, yeah, if only I could.      

42:32.652 --> 42:33.786
                    Do you think
                 there's any way

42:33.853 --> 42:35.354
              for him to get out
                of that bedroom?

42:35.422 --> 42:36.355
Yeah, he could                  
always jump                     

42:36.423 --> 42:37.990
out the window and              
come to the back door.          

42:38.058 --> 42:38.991
    (fumbling at door)          

42:39.059 --> 42:40.292
  Oh, cool. Maybe this is him.  

42:43.129 --> 42:45.030
         (dogs whining)         

42:47.901 --> 42:49.034
                        Whew!   

42:49.102 --> 42:51.003
I wonder what put the           
fear into those dogs?           

42:51.071 --> 42:53.739
         Oh, Mayday...          

42:56.309 --> 42:59.111
          It's payday!          

42:59.179 --> 43:01.080
No, no, no, honey,              
please, sweetheart...           

43:01.147 --> 43:03.382
        You stand still         
    and take it like a man.     

43:03.450 --> 43:04.783
                 No, no, I never
            fight with women,   

43:04.851 --> 43:05.984
                  especially one
             who could cream me.

43:06.052 --> 43:07.186
      Baby, let's stop it.      

43:07.253 --> 43:08.520
You've just finished            
icing the cake.                 

43:09.856 --> 43:11.023
Someone could get               
hurt by accident.               

43:11.091 --> 43:12.324
        It won't be an accident!

43:12.425 --> 43:14.360
No. Please. No,                 
Carla don't. Carla.             

43:14.427 --> 43:15.761
      Please. I need help.      

43:15.829 --> 43:18.897
          Attention everyone.   
         Here comes the bride.  

43:18.965 --> 43:22.701
        Oh! Oh, Mr. Gaines,     
        you must be so proud.   

43:30.343 --> 43:32.077
Woody, that was close.          

43:32.145 --> 43:34.346
    Boy, now I'm really gonna   
        have to marry her today.

43:36.950 --> 43:38.817
     Okay, buddy. You ready     
        to go out there?        

43:38.885 --> 43:39.818
                 I'm ready, Sam.

43:39.886 --> 43:41.020
             All right.         
            Here we go.         

43:41.087 --> 43:42.021
    Wait, wait, wait, wait.     

43:42.088 --> 43:43.255
          Wood, before you      
          go out there...       

43:43.323 --> 43:44.556
Listen, there's something       

43:44.624 --> 43:45.891
I'd like to give                
you that...                     

43:45.959 --> 43:48.260
well, I wish that someone had   
given to me on my wedding day.  

43:48.328 --> 43:49.828
        Cliffy, you want        
      to hold him, please?      

43:49.896 --> 43:51.463
No, no, no. Whoo!               

43:52.866 --> 43:53.832
    No, it's okay,              
    Mr. Peterson.               

43:53.900 --> 43:54.967
    I really love her.          

43:55.035 --> 43:56.235
Okay, Wood, just don't come     

43:56.302 --> 43:57.903
complaining to me               
in about ten years.             

43:57.971 --> 44:00.372
Although you <i>will</i> know          
where to find me, won't you?    

44:01.708 --> 44:02.675
            Turn around here.   

44:02.742 --> 44:05.344
                 Oh, man, I'm so
                 proud of you.  

44:05.412 --> 44:07.212
        Oh, thanks, Sam.        
      Thank you very much.      

44:07.280 --> 44:08.981
            Come on. Come on.   

44:10.417 --> 44:11.750
                 You see, Carla?

44:11.818 --> 44:13.185
                 You were wrong.

44:13.253 --> 44:15.320
         Oh, sure, it could have
    turned out to be a disaster,

44:15.388 --> 44:19.191
      but we all worked together
     and we got everything done.

44:19.259 --> 44:20.993
            You know what?      

44:21.061 --> 44:23.662
          I think this wedding's
    gonna turn out just fine.   

44:24.931 --> 44:26.598
                Just fine.
