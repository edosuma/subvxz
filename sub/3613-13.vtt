00:13.430 --> 00:15.974
Excuse me, but I'm getting ready
to close now.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.727
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
that you were open till 1.

00:18.894 --> 00:22.147
Normally, I am, but not on the
eve of Friday the 13th.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.399
In fact, I kind of wanna
be closed by midnight.

00:24.566 --> 00:27.110
All right, well, we won't be
much longer, will we, Pheebs?

00:27.277 --> 00:30.864
Okay, okay. So input?

00:31.031 --> 00:33.450
- It's nice. Let's go.
- It's nice? That's it?

00:33.617 --> 00:36.995
- Maybe I should look for another one.
- Phoebe, the woman wants to close.

00:37.162 --> 00:40.957
I know, I know, but choosing the right
good-luck charm is a very big decision.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.752
If they all bring good luck,
what's the worst that can happen

00:43.919 --> 00:45.879
if you choose the wrong one?

00:46.046 --> 00:49.215
All right, you know, this is why
I like shopping with Piper.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.927
Do you want me to put this
on Piper's order?

00:53.094 --> 00:55.263
- No, I'll pay separately.
- Cash or charge?

00:55.889 --> 00:58.475
Will you put it on a credit card for me?
I will pay you back.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.435
You know, tomorrow
I have a job interview...

01:00.602 --> 01:04.563
And the good-luck charm
is going to help you get the job.

01:04.980 --> 01:07.233
- How much?
- Twenty-five fifty, plus tax.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.860
Okay.

01:09.027 --> 01:11.654
Oh, but you get 10 percent off
if you sign the mailing list.

01:12.363 --> 01:15.074
See? Good luck already.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.372
If you're interested,
we're having a Wicca gathering

01:21.539 --> 01:23.249
for the Spring Equinox.

01:23.791 --> 01:26.044
What makes you think that
we would be interested?

01:26.377 --> 01:28.379
Most witches are.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.758
We never said
that we were witches.

01:35.887 --> 01:38.097
- You think she knows?
- How could she?

01:50.735 --> 01:52.653
Can you please hurry?

01:52.862 --> 01:54.864
- Is there a problem?
- I told you, I just...

01:55.031 --> 01:56.532
I wanted to be closed
before midnight.

01:56.699 --> 01:59.911
Wow, you really take this
Friday the 13th stuff seriously.

02:00.077 --> 02:02.246
Yeah, you should too.
Especially this one.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.874
- And why is that?
- Because once every 1,300 years,

02:05.041 --> 02:09.169
there's a universal convergence
of negative energy on Friday the 13th.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.089
- And this is the year.
- Of course it is.

02:15.926 --> 02:17.344
Did you hear that?

02:18.137 --> 02:22.183
The clock struck 13.
It's starting already.

02:30.316 --> 02:31.567
Goodnight, Tanjella.

03:14.443 --> 03:16.570
Sorry, we're closed.

03:20.115 --> 03:21.908
I said, we're closed.

03:29.249 --> 03:31.668
Not to me, witch.

03:31.877 --> 03:33.128
Oh, my God.

03:37.257 --> 03:41.595
Amulets don't work with this demon.

03:48.810 --> 03:54.774
Your greatest fear is being
buried alive in an earthquake.

04:06.411 --> 04:08.288
Yes.

04:14.043 --> 04:16.254
Oh, you can't run!
You're frozen...

04:17.547 --> 04:19.173
...in fear!

07:01.084 --> 07:04.170
Think about it.
When has she ever said it to you?

07:04.337 --> 07:06.631
I don't remember exactly,
but I'm sure she must have.

07:06.798 --> 07:09.968
Yeah, okay. Try to think of a time.
Just one.

07:10.135 --> 07:12.345
Whenever I say it to her,
she says something like,

07:12.512 --> 07:15.723
- "Oh, me too" or, "Same here."
- You know, you're right.

07:15.890 --> 07:19.727
Yeah, the girl cannot say the words,
"I love you." It's like some weird...

07:19.894 --> 07:22.772
- Morning.
- Oh, good morning.

07:23.481 --> 07:27.485
- Oh, that outfit looks great on you.
- Thank you for giving it to me.

07:27.652 --> 07:29.821
Wait, you gave her that outfit?

07:29.988 --> 07:31.531
Yeah, it was an early
birthday present.

07:31.698 --> 07:34.784
- For the next three years.
- Are you feeling okay?

07:34.951 --> 07:36.911
I am fine.

07:37.078 --> 07:39.747
In fact, I had a wonderful dream
about Mom.

07:40.832 --> 07:42.625
Oh, how great. What about?

07:42.792 --> 07:45.795
Well, I was a little kid,

07:45.962 --> 07:50.299
like 4 or 5, and I was reaching up,
holding her hand.

07:50.466 --> 07:52.885
And she was taking me someplace.

07:53.052 --> 07:56.597
I don't know where,
but it felt so safe.

07:56.764 --> 07:59.100
- I wish I had dreams like that.
- Mom would have to knock

07:59.267 --> 08:01.310
before she came into your dreams.

08:04.981 --> 08:06.732
What are you doing?

08:06.899 --> 08:10.653
You have to cover your mouth when
you yawn, or you might let the devil in.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.740
Especially on Friday the 13th.

08:15.116 --> 08:18.077
Is that amulet one of the things
that we picked up for you last night?

08:18.244 --> 08:21.789
Yes, and this and these.

08:21.956 --> 08:25.418
We're having a superstition-themed
fundraiser at the restaurant today.

08:25.584 --> 08:27.294
I'm going to need
all the help I can get.

08:27.753 --> 08:30.214
Don't you think that you're
overdoing it just a little bit?

08:30.381 --> 08:33.092
With all the warlocks and demons
we've seen, I don't think so.

08:33.551 --> 08:35.344
Piper, those things are real.

08:35.719 --> 08:37.847
Okay, superstitions are like

08:38.013 --> 08:41.433
old wives' tales invented to explain
somebody's misfortune.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.270
Statistics show more bad things
happen on Friday the 13th

08:44.436 --> 08:47.189
than any other day.
I met Jeremy on Friday the 13th.

08:47.356 --> 08:49.441
- Really?
- Yes, and he tried to kill me.

08:49.608 --> 08:53.362
Afterwards, I found out there's
a superstition that any relationship

08:53.529 --> 08:55.698
started on Friday the 13th
is doomed.

08:55.864 --> 08:57.991
More bad things happen
on Friday the 13th

08:58.158 --> 09:00.994
because people put energy into
believing bad things will happen.

09:01.578 --> 09:03.080
Pheebs?

09:03.247 --> 09:06.792
Actually, I prefer the upside
of superstition: Good fortune.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.920
Which is what I hope this little honey
brings me at my job interview

09:10.087 --> 09:12.422
with the real estate agency.
Will you give me a lift?

09:12.589 --> 09:14.800
- I'm running late.
- Sure.

09:14.967 --> 09:18.178
Okay, well, have a great day, Prue.

09:18.345 --> 09:20.264
- I love you.
- Yeah, me too.

09:27.479 --> 09:30.023
I wonder if she knows
she does that.

09:34.403 --> 09:36.655
- Oh, hey, Andy.
- Hey. Prue in?

09:36.822 --> 09:39.074
Prue, there's a policeman
here to see you.

09:39.241 --> 09:42.452
See you later, Andy.
We're running late.

09:47.040 --> 09:50.085
- So this must be bad news.
- Why would you say that?

09:50.252 --> 09:54.089
- It's a little early for a social call.
- You're right.

09:54.256 --> 09:56.299
We've had three suspicious deaths
since midnight.

09:56.466 --> 10:01.263
All single females, all under 30.
One was a bookstore owner.

10:01.429 --> 10:04.266
Credit card company's records
show you were her last customer.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.101
Oh, my God.

10:06.810 --> 10:08.478
You remember anything
out of the ordinary?

10:08.645 --> 10:10.689
Suspicious characters
hanging around?

10:10.855 --> 10:12.816
No, Phoebe and I were
the only ones in there.

10:12.982 --> 10:15.318
In fact, she was locking up
when we left.

10:15.485 --> 10:18.071
- Was the place in order?
- Yeah. Why?

10:18.238 --> 10:21.157
Well, when we found her,
her body was half buried in debris.

10:21.324 --> 10:23.576
The coroner said it wasn't
her injuries that killed her.

10:23.743 --> 10:26.621
- It was a heart attack.
- A heart attack?

10:26.788 --> 10:30.333
Yeah, her hair had turned shock white.
Her face was contorted in terror,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.544
just like all the others.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.295
If I didn't know any better,

10:34.462 --> 10:37.090
I'd say they were
literally scared to death.

10:37.924 --> 10:41.552
You visit occult bookstores
at midnight often?

10:42.136 --> 10:44.263
No, of course not.

10:44.430 --> 10:47.475
Phoebe needed a good-luck charm
for her job interview today.

10:47.642 --> 10:49.435
It was... It was very last-minute.

10:49.602 --> 10:52.313
These killings look like some
weird, ritualistic thing.

10:52.480 --> 10:55.274
The victims all had ties to the occult.

10:57.026 --> 10:59.320
You might consider shopping
somewhere else.

11:00.905 --> 11:02.698
Meaning?

11:02.865 --> 11:04.450
Just be careful.

11:11.415 --> 11:13.918
Friday the 13th.

11:14.085 --> 11:16.545
Friday the 13th.

11:18.089 --> 11:22.093
"The Demon of Fear appears
once every 1,300 years

11:22.259 --> 11:24.512
on Friday the 13th.

11:24.679 --> 11:28.391
He feeds on the fears
of witches for his survival."

11:30.601 --> 11:32.561
Mom's handwriting.

11:39.485 --> 11:41.529
Okay, we need a table
for taking the tickets.

11:41.695 --> 11:42.738
Okay.

11:48.035 --> 11:49.745
Who's the guy?

11:49.912 --> 11:54.083
Lucas Devane. He's chairing the
fundraiser for the children's hospital.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.710
Oh, right. I saw his picture
in a magazine.

11:56.877 --> 12:00.089
Wasn't he named one of the
Bay Area's most eligible bachelors?

12:00.255 --> 12:02.549
- Don't rub it in.
- Hey, you're the one who's letting

12:02.716 --> 12:05.719
a silly superstition run your life.

12:05.886 --> 12:07.805
Is he still looking over here?

12:09.306 --> 12:10.474
Yeah.

12:10.641 --> 12:12.851
He's undressing you with his mind,

12:13.018 --> 12:15.729
and he's down to white cotton.

12:15.896 --> 12:19.525
I haven't worn white cotton
since high school.

12:21.652 --> 12:23.445
Humour me.

12:23.612 --> 12:25.614
So sorry I had to rush you
off the phone.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.116
What's with the Demon of Fear?

12:28.283 --> 12:30.744
<i>Well, I found a page about him
in the Book of Shadows</i>

12:30.911 --> 12:32.204
in Mom's handwriting.

12:32.371 --> 12:35.040
- Mom? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

12:35.207 --> 12:38.502
I checked it against the handwriting
on the back of the spirit board.

12:39.252 --> 12:42.506
<i>Wow, this is the first time we've found
anything Mom's written in the Book.</i>

12:43.006 --> 12:45.842
Well, she must've known that this
demon would appear in our lifetime,

12:46.009 --> 12:48.053
and she wanted to warn us
against him.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.888
I don't like the sound of that.

12:50.055 --> 12:53.975
Well, if he can kill
13 unmarried witches before midnight,

12:54.142 --> 12:57.604
he'll be freed from the underworld
to wreak his terror every single day.

12:57.771 --> 13:01.441
Unmarried. Like being single
doesn't have enough problems.

13:01.942 --> 13:03.777
- So how can we stop him?
- I don't know.

13:03.944 --> 13:08.239
But he does kill by turning
a witch's greatest fear against her.

13:08.406 --> 13:10.575
<i>- Meaning?
- The Book doesn't say.</i>

13:11.201 --> 13:16.247
But Mom wrote that in the face of our
greatest fear our powers are paralyzed.

13:16.414 --> 13:18.666
Wait a minute.
We're on the most-wanted list,

13:18.833 --> 13:20.877
and we're defenceless?

13:21.044 --> 13:23.421
Didn't Mom say anything
about how to get rid of him?

13:23.588 --> 13:26.341
- Just to release our fear.
- How do we do that?

13:26.508 --> 13:28.968
Don't know. That's all she wrote.

13:29.135 --> 13:33.348
Look, I know that
you're afraid of flying.

13:33.515 --> 13:36.434
It's not really a fear.
I just prefer buses.

13:36.601 --> 13:40.396
Well, as long as you stay in
a crowded restaurant, you'll be fine.

13:40.563 --> 13:43.691
And since Phoebe's afraid of being
trapped in an elevator,

13:43.858 --> 13:46.069
I'll tell her to take the stairs.

13:46.235 --> 13:47.987
And you'll stay away from pools.

13:50.490 --> 13:53.493
Ever since Mom drowned,
you've been terrified of the water.

13:53.993 --> 13:56.537
That's why you never took
swimming lessons with us.

13:56.704 --> 14:00.291
We've always known
that was the reason. It's okay.

14:00.500 --> 14:03.795
Yeah, well, don't worry about me.
I'll be fine. I gotta go.

14:03.961 --> 14:06.756
Call me when you get to Buckland's.

14:06.923 --> 14:11.761
I'm not going to Buckland's.
Mom warned us, but there are others.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.388
We don't know any other witches.

14:14.555 --> 14:17.850
No, see, Tanjella gave me
this flyer for a Wicca gathering.

14:18.517 --> 14:20.811
And there's a woman named
Zoe listed as a contact.

14:20.978 --> 14:22.939
I'm hoping that she can help.
So call Pheebs

14:23.105 --> 14:24.815
- and let her know what's up, okay?
- Okay.

14:25.650 --> 14:26.692
Okay.

14:26.901 --> 14:29.362
- I love you.
- Yep.

14:33.282 --> 14:36.452
We're a small firm, but we've
built a very successful business.

14:36.619 --> 14:39.789
Oh, well, size doesn't matter to me.

14:39.955 --> 14:41.874
What does excite me though
is the chance

14:42.041 --> 14:43.667
to work with a successful woman.

14:43.834 --> 14:46.545
I mean, if I wanna be a success,
who better to learn from, right?

14:46.712 --> 14:48.422
Well, I like that.

14:48.589 --> 14:52.218
I've heard all I need to hear.
When can you start?

14:53.469 --> 14:55.471
Are you serious? I got the job?

14:55.638 --> 14:59.558
I can spot talent when I see it.
Can you start today?

14:59.725 --> 15:03.145
Yeah. Yes, of course.

15:04.563 --> 15:07.191
Hi, honey. Give me a second.

15:10.611 --> 15:14.323
Here are the keys.
Louise is out of town. I've got...

15:15.991 --> 15:19.703
I'll be in Calistoga for the day, so all
you have to do is answer the phones.

15:19.870 --> 15:22.831
Taking a romantic midweek break?

15:22.998 --> 15:26.126
Well, yeah, which reminds me...

15:26.710 --> 15:30.380
...there is one special task I'll need
you to handle from time to time.

15:30.547 --> 15:34.218
If my husband calls,
I'll need you to cover for me.

15:38.722 --> 15:40.766
Oh, right.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.977
- Sure.
- Our little secret?

15:44.144 --> 15:46.146
Oh, of course.

15:46.938 --> 15:50.984
Well, you have my pager number,
so have fun.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.195
Okay.

15:56.281 --> 15:58.408
You too.

16:22.599 --> 16:25.352
I thought you might come.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.898
There's nothing for you here.

16:30.231 --> 16:33.818
Oh, you couldn't be
more wrong, witch.

16:35.445 --> 16:37.906
You're all alone. That's all I need.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.992
You have no power over me.

16:41.159 --> 16:47.123
I have evolved to a place where
I have released all mortal fears.

16:48.207 --> 16:52.128
My inner strength will destroy you.

17:04.682 --> 17:07.268
You didn't release your fear of fire.

17:07.435 --> 17:09.228
You only repressed it.

17:11.439 --> 17:14.275
No. Please.

17:14.442 --> 17:18.279
Save it for another lifetime.

17:19.906 --> 17:23.034
You're frozen in fear!

17:28.497 --> 17:29.540
Hello.

17:59.111 --> 18:01.780
Sorry I'm late. So, what do we have?

18:01.947 --> 18:04.116
The coroner says there are
no burn marks on the body.

18:04.533 --> 18:08.621
She didn't die of smoke inhalation.
Her heart gave out, just like the others.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.540
And I can't believe you're wearing
the serial shoes again.

18:12.207 --> 18:15.544
- They're my good-luck charms.
- They're embarrassing.

18:15.711 --> 18:18.547
This is the fifth woman with ties to
the occult that's been found dead

18:18.714 --> 18:22.384
since midnight. Now, tell me it's not
the work of some serial nutcase.

18:22.593 --> 18:26.680
I can't, but it still doesn't mean
those shoes aren't embarrassing.

18:26.847 --> 18:30.267
Inspector, will you look at this?

18:41.778 --> 18:44.656
The doorman keeps
a visitor sign-in log.

18:44.823 --> 18:47.200
Wanna guess who the last person
was to see the victim?

18:47.367 --> 18:49.369
I'm gonna guess the killer.

18:49.870 --> 18:51.496
Prue.

18:54.207 --> 18:56.585
- What did you tell Andy?
- I didn't talk to Andy.

18:56.752 --> 18:59.421
I didn't want him to know that
I was anywhere near there,

18:59.588 --> 19:03.049
- so I called 911, and I left.
- Are you sure you're okay?

19:03.216 --> 19:06.344
Yeah, it's just that I can't get her face
out of my mind, you know.

19:06.553 --> 19:10.015
There was so much fear,
and her hair was pure white.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.142
The terror that she must've felt,
it's just...

19:12.309 --> 19:16.313
Okay, I'm scared enough,
thank you. So now what?

19:16.479 --> 19:19.316
We avoid any place
he could use to terrorize us.

19:19.482 --> 19:22.360
- And what about all the other witches?
- I took Zoe's Day Runner.

19:22.527 --> 19:25.989
Some of the names in it have got to be
witches. I'll start making phone calls.

19:28.241 --> 19:29.868
Quick, throw some
over your shoulder.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.953
- Don't be ridiculous.
- It's bad luck.

19:32.120 --> 19:34.748
You could be attacked by evil spirits.

19:34.914 --> 19:38.543
Piper, we have been attacked
by plenty of evil spirits,

19:38.710 --> 19:42.130
and they had nothing to do with salt.
And considering our powers,

19:42.672 --> 19:45.341
I can't believe that you wanna rely
on this for our protection.

19:45.508 --> 19:48.052
My feeling is you can never
be too rich or too safe.

19:48.219 --> 19:50.221
Oh, look, a ladybug.

19:51.055 --> 19:54.225
- Is that bad luck?
- No, actually, Grams once told me

19:54.392 --> 19:58.229
that whatever direction it flies in
you can find your ideal mate.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.732
We gotta try it. Ready?

20:10.033 --> 20:13.369
So does a positive superstition
cancel out a negative one?

20:13.536 --> 20:15.747
- I don't know.
- Wait, what's going on?

20:15.913 --> 20:18.291
That guy has been trying
to talk to Piper all day,

20:18.458 --> 20:20.585
and she has been avoiding him
because she...

20:22.461 --> 20:25.089
Oh, no.

20:25.256 --> 20:27.800
- You should've thrown the sa...
- Piper, don't even say it.

20:27.967 --> 20:30.928
- The salt. Okay.
- I'm going home to change.

20:31.095 --> 20:33.556
- Be careful. I love you.
- Yeah.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.103
All right, so she can't say it.

20:39.270 --> 20:42.523
Maybe she's afraid it'll make her
look too vulnerable.

20:42.690 --> 20:45.735
Ever since Mom died, you know,
she has to be the strong one

20:45.901 --> 20:49.155
to take care of us and everything.
It's probably just all part of that.

20:49.321 --> 20:52.783
- Maybe. Hey, I gotta get back to work.
- How's the new job?

20:52.950 --> 20:56.829
Great, except my new boss wants me
to lie to her husband about an affair

20:56.996 --> 21:00.457
- that she's been having.
- How nice. What are you gonna do?

21:00.624 --> 21:03.335
I don't know. I'm just hoping
it never comes up.

21:03.502 --> 21:06.005
Hey, good luck.

21:10.551 --> 21:13.721
- How's it going?
- Oh, good.

21:14.471 --> 21:17.808
Listen, we've been working so well
together on this fundraiser,

21:17.975 --> 21:21.311
I was wondering if you'd want
to get dinner after it's over.

21:23.981 --> 21:27.151
I should probably... I should
probably check my schedule.

21:27.860 --> 21:32.114
- You don't know if you're free tonight?
- Well...

21:36.160 --> 21:37.703
Dinner would be great.

21:38.704 --> 21:40.247
Great.

21:47.671 --> 21:52.301
Okay, heads, I tell him the truth.
Tails, I lie.

22:00.517 --> 22:02.769
Oh, that helped a lot.

22:07.774 --> 22:10.610
Oh, hold on, please.

22:14.614 --> 22:15.949
Prue.

22:19.661 --> 22:22.205
No one's in. Call back later.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.094
<i>We're not in. You know what to do.</i>

22:36.261 --> 22:38.638
<i>Prue, it's Phoebe. Pick up.</i>

22:38.805 --> 22:41.599
<i>Prue, are you there?
Pick up. Hello?</i>

22:41.766 --> 22:45.353
Prue, I just had a premonition.
You could be in trouble. Are you there?

22:46.229 --> 22:49.065
<i>Prue, are you there? Hello?</i>

22:49.274 --> 22:51.359
<i>Prue, pick up.</i>

23:25.643 --> 23:28.563
Your greatest fear is drowning.

23:28.729 --> 23:32.066
Thank you for making it so easy.

23:38.823 --> 23:40.032
That's right.

23:41.575 --> 23:43.744
Feed me your fear.

23:43.911 --> 23:45.663
No!

23:48.207 --> 23:49.917
Help!

24:02.054 --> 24:04.765
Your powers are frozen by your fear.

24:17.528 --> 24:20.864
I wish I could think of a logical reason
to explain why Prue's involved in this.

24:21.031 --> 24:24.702
You mean, this time
or every other time?

24:30.708 --> 24:31.917
Look out.

24:33.877 --> 24:35.504
Prue?

24:40.384 --> 24:42.177
Prue?

24:44.638 --> 24:46.682
Prue?

24:52.187 --> 24:53.855
You okay?

24:54.022 --> 24:55.357
I don't know.

25:02.072 --> 25:04.366
I'll wait for you downstairs.

25:39.192 --> 25:41.027
So, what were you screaming about?

25:41.194 --> 25:44.239
- I told you, I had soap in my eyes.
- You had soap in your eyes?

25:44.406 --> 25:46.908
- That's why you were screaming?
- Yes.

25:47.075 --> 25:49.077
What were you doing
at that woman's apartment?

25:49.452 --> 25:51.496
Well, I was...

25:52.413 --> 25:57.043
Zoe was a collector of occult items,
and she wanted to know

25:57.210 --> 26:00.171
if the auction house was interested
in selling them for her.

26:00.338 --> 26:03.883
When you got there,
was she alive or already dead?

26:04.300 --> 26:05.802
Dead.

26:06.594 --> 26:09.097
So you called 911?
Why didn't you leave your name?

26:09.264 --> 26:12.350
- Why'd you just duck out?
- Because I wanted to avoid this.

26:12.850 --> 26:16.104
I knew that you would suspect me
of being involved, and I'm not.

26:16.270 --> 26:19.023
Don't you think it's a little coincidental,
you being one step ahead

26:19.190 --> 26:22.318
- of death twice in one day.
- What exactly are you implying?

26:22.485 --> 26:25.279
- In my shoes, what would you think?
- First of all,

26:25.446 --> 26:27.573
- nobody should be in those shoes.
- Told you.

26:27.740 --> 26:28.908
But if I were,

26:29.075 --> 26:31.953
I would never think that you had
anything to do with these deaths.

26:32.411 --> 26:36.916
Prue, five women your age have been
scared to death since midnight.

26:37.291 --> 26:39.293
Now, we show up,
we hear you screaming, break in,

26:39.460 --> 26:41.087
find you terrified in the shower...

26:41.254 --> 26:42.964
I told you, I had soap in my eyes.

26:43.130 --> 26:45.299
That wasn't pain on your face,
that was fear.

26:48.219 --> 26:49.971
Prue!

26:50.262 --> 26:52.181
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:52.348 --> 26:56.018
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

26:56.185 --> 27:00.481
- So are we done?
- Yeah, we're done.

27:12.034 --> 27:13.869
You would not believe
what happened to me.

27:14.036 --> 27:18.040
Yes, I would. I saw it. Prue...

27:18.207 --> 27:20.292
...he came really close, didn't he?

27:20.793 --> 27:23.671
You've got some white in your hair.

27:42.314 --> 27:44.817
<i>There's gotta be something
in the Book about releasing fears.</i>

27:44.983 --> 27:47.277
Maybe it's just not obvious.

27:48.237 --> 27:50.697
Phoebe, do you smell that?

27:50.864 --> 27:54.493
- What?
- It's like sandalwood.

27:54.826 --> 27:56.161
No, I don't smell anything.

27:56.536 --> 27:59.456
Mom used to wear
a fragrance like that.

28:00.749 --> 28:02.876
I was too young to remember.

28:04.711 --> 28:07.172
Wait, I thought you said
there was nothing in here

28:07.339 --> 28:09.591
about releasing your fear.

28:11.301 --> 28:14.846
"To let go of your fear,
trust in the greatest of all powers."

28:15.013 --> 28:17.140
That wasn't there this morning.

28:17.307 --> 28:20.102
Well, you know, maybe because
of all the stress you've been under...

28:20.268 --> 28:23.271
No, it wasn't there. It's in Mom's
handwriting. I would've remembered.

28:23.438 --> 28:25.232
Okay.

28:25.398 --> 28:27.317
What do you think the
greatest of all powers is?

28:27.484 --> 28:30.278
- Do you think it's the power of three?
- I don't know.

28:30.445 --> 28:33.907
- What is it?
- It's like I can feel her presence.

28:35.784 --> 28:38.703
Okay, maybe you should
get dressed and go to Buckland's.

28:38.870 --> 28:41.957
No, I don't really think
that I'm up for that.

28:42.123 --> 28:44.709
Look, Prue, you said he disappeared
once Andy got there.

28:44.876 --> 28:47.170
So maybe he only attacks
when you're alone,

28:47.337 --> 28:50.215
- when your fear is greatest.
- Yeah, you're right.

28:50.382 --> 28:53.843
Of course I am. And whatever you do,
stay away from water. Any water.

28:54.010 --> 28:56.054
- Don't even drink it.
- Don't worry.

28:57.597 --> 28:59.724
- I love you.
- Me too.

29:01.142 --> 29:03.061
Hey, why do you do that?

29:03.228 --> 29:06.648
- What?
- You never say, "I love you" to me.

29:06.814 --> 29:09.901
- I just did.
- No, you just said, "Me too."

29:10.068 --> 29:13.905
You never say it to Piper either. Have
you ever said, "I love you" to anybody?

29:18.952 --> 29:20.870
Yeah, I said it to Mom.

29:21.037 --> 29:23.247
It was the last thing I said to her
before she died.

29:46.562 --> 29:49.982
Do me a favour? Walk behind me
so you don't cross my path.

29:50.191 --> 29:52.360
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

29:54.070 --> 29:55.946
You dropped your tail.

30:09.585 --> 30:11.545
- Are you okay?
- Me?

30:11.712 --> 30:15.216
Yeah, you seem kind of,
I don't know, tense.

30:15.382 --> 30:18.344
Well, it just seems ever since
I agreed to have dinner with Lucas

30:18.511 --> 30:20.971
I've had a run of bad luck.

30:21.138 --> 30:23.515
I broke a nail,
the shipment of clams is late,

30:23.682 --> 30:25.851
I had to fire a hostess,
and I just ripped my skirt.

30:26.018 --> 30:28.687
Well, it is Friday the 13th.

30:29.146 --> 30:30.189
Doug, order up.

30:36.904 --> 30:37.946
Here you go.

30:39.365 --> 30:41.533
- Yeah, just hand it here.
- Here you go. It's ready.

30:46.580 --> 30:49.750
<i>Sage so fair, from far and wide</i>

30:49.917 --> 30:53.670
<i>Take my troubles
And brush them aside</i>

30:56.006 --> 30:57.049
Hey!

30:57.341 --> 30:59.760
Is there a fire?
Where's the smoke coming from?

31:00.886 --> 31:03.013
- Is there a fire?
- I don't know.

31:03.555 --> 31:06.266
- Is it malfunctioning?
- Just not my day.

31:12.939 --> 31:14.733
Hi. May I help you?

31:14.900 --> 31:16.777
Hi, I was looking for Susan.

31:16.943 --> 31:20.447
Oh, she's not here, but I can tell her
you came by. What's your name?

31:20.614 --> 31:22.657
Richard Warner.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.369
You're Susan's husband.

31:26.536 --> 31:28.705
Unless she's got one
that I don't know about.

31:30.707 --> 31:33.043
No. No.

31:33.210 --> 31:35.086
She doesn't have another husband.

31:35.253 --> 31:38.924
I thought I'd surprise her and take her
to dinner. You know where she is?

31:39.758 --> 31:41.301
Yes.

31:41.801 --> 31:43.595
She went out.

31:44.137 --> 31:48.058
Okay, well, I think we established that.
Do you know where?

31:49.059 --> 31:50.810
Well, she...

31:50.977 --> 31:54.064
It's actually interesting. She just...

31:54.230 --> 31:56.399
I can't do this.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.234
I don't understand.

31:58.401 --> 32:01.404
I'm sorry, Mr Warner, but I can't be
the assistant your wife wants

32:01.571 --> 32:04.073
without compromising my beliefs,
and I just won't do that.

32:04.240 --> 32:06.659
- Wait a minute. Slow down.
- Don't worry about the office.

32:06.826 --> 32:08.953
I will lock up.
Susan...

32:11.039 --> 32:12.624
Thank you.

32:14.417 --> 32:15.501
For what?

32:15.668 --> 32:18.046
For not lying to me
about Susan's affair.

32:18.922 --> 32:20.882
- You knew?
- I've tried to deny it

32:21.049 --> 32:24.052
for some time now, but I guess...

32:24.886 --> 32:28.222
...there comes a time when
you have to face the truth.

32:28.765 --> 32:29.974
I'm so sorry.

32:30.683 --> 32:31.934
Don't be.

32:32.101 --> 32:34.812
And listen, don't quit on my behalf.

32:35.938 --> 32:37.940
I'm not.

32:52.830 --> 32:55.333
<i>- SWA Property.
- Hello, may I speak to Susan?</i>

32:55.499 --> 32:57.752
No, she's not in right now.
Can I take a message?

32:57.919 --> 33:01.172
<i>This is Mrs Joffee. I'm outside a house
Susan's supposed to show me,</i>

33:01.339 --> 33:03.507
<i>and she's not here.</i>

33:03.674 --> 33:06.844
Well, I'm sorry,
but she must've forgotten.

33:07.011 --> 33:08.596
She's out for the rest of the day.

33:08.763 --> 33:11.932
<i>Can anybody help me? I flew in
from L.A. just to see this house.</i>

33:12.099 --> 33:15.102
<i>I'm under a terrible deadline
to move from my other house.</i>

33:15.269 --> 33:17.229
No one's here.

33:17.730 --> 33:19.648
But, you know,
since you flew in and all,

33:19.815 --> 33:23.611
I guess I can show you the property.
What's the address?

33:39.168 --> 33:41.378
Mrs Joffee?

33:41.962 --> 33:44.214
Hello.

33:52.347 --> 33:54.641
Mrs Joffee?

33:54.808 --> 33:57.728
It's SWA Properties.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.857
Hello, dear.

34:02.024 --> 34:04.526
Thanks so much for coming out.

34:07.404 --> 34:10.866
- Let go, or I'll scream.
- Go ahead, I could use the fix.

34:15.786 --> 34:19.623
I know how you kill, but there
are no elevators around here.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.668
Elevators? That's what you think
your greatest fear is?

34:22.835 --> 34:27.799
You mortals need to look deeper.
Down where the real truth lies.

34:27.966 --> 34:32.846
Your greatest fear is losing a sister,
and I get two for one.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.565
He's only a threat
till midnight, okay?

34:44.107 --> 34:48.152
All right, well, take care
and don't look in any closets till then.

34:48.612 --> 34:52.239
All right, look, I gotta go.
Somebody's calling me. Bye.

34:52.407 --> 34:53.908
- Hello?
- Prue, it's Phoebe.

34:54.074 --> 34:56.661
I got stuck at a house I was showing.
Can you come get me?

34:56.828 --> 35:01.624
- Yeah, sure. Where are you?
- I'm at 3112 Napa Street.

35:01.791 --> 35:05.003
All right. I'm on my way.

35:22.812 --> 35:26.024
I can't remember when
I've enjoyed a dinner more.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.610
I'm so glad you suggested this.

35:28.776 --> 35:30.820
You know, I almost didn't.

35:30.987 --> 35:32.655
- Really?
- Well, I'm pretty sensitive

35:32.822 --> 35:35.867
to people's feelings,
and I got the sense this morning

35:36.034 --> 35:38.745
that you were
totally turned off to me.

35:38.911 --> 35:40.913
How odd.

35:41.664 --> 35:47.086
So, what's it like being one of the city's
most eligible bachelors?

35:47.795 --> 35:51.883
Oh, that magazine article was so lame.
I'm really a very simple guy.

35:52.049 --> 35:56.804
I value home and hearth.
I'd like to settle down, have kids.

35:56.971 --> 36:01.475
I've got two nieces I'm crazy about.
I even carry pictures of them.

36:06.814 --> 36:09.358
You sound too good to be true.

36:19.744 --> 36:22.329
You are too good to be true.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.586
Lint. You had a little lint.

36:28.752 --> 36:30.671
Oh, thanks.

36:31.046 --> 36:34.550
So your instinct about me
this morning was right.

36:34.717 --> 36:37.803
I was sort of sending out
negative vibes.

36:38.387 --> 36:39.597
Why?

36:39.763 --> 36:41.348
Well, there's this superstition

36:41.515 --> 36:44.727
that any relationship
started on Friday the 13th is doomed.

36:44.893 --> 36:46.770
So I was determined to avoid you.

36:46.937 --> 36:50.566
But then there's another superstition
about finding your ideal mate...

36:50.733 --> 36:52.317
Wait a minute.

36:53.068 --> 36:57.489
You were gonna reject me
because of a superstition,

36:57.656 --> 37:00.075
but then decided
I was worth going out with

37:00.242 --> 37:02.578
only because
of another superstition?

37:04.163 --> 37:05.289
Yeah.

37:05.455 --> 37:08.250
Well, doesn't say much for me then,
does it?

37:08.417 --> 37:09.793
Oh, no, it's not...

37:09.960 --> 37:13.255
Piper, I'm sure you're very nice,

37:13.422 --> 37:16.842
but someone who lets things
like superstitions or omens

37:17.009 --> 37:19.511
determine their lives...

37:20.512 --> 37:24.182
Well, I just had an experience
like that

37:24.349 --> 37:28.186
with my last girlfriend,
and it was a disaster.

37:28.353 --> 37:33.692
I'm looking for someone
who's just not into that stuff.

37:34.317 --> 37:35.735
I'm sorry.

37:47.831 --> 37:50.625
- Phoebe?
- I'm in the backyard.

37:50.792 --> 37:53.128
You won't believe
the view from here.

37:55.130 --> 37:57.674
Pheebs, where are you?

38:01.636 --> 38:03.638
Phoebe?

38:07.225 --> 38:10.311
Isn't that a great view?

38:10.478 --> 38:12.480
Bring your suit?

38:22.282 --> 38:24.284
That's right.

38:26.452 --> 38:28.454
Feed me your fear.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.849
<i>Prue.</i>

38:48.015 --> 38:49.183
<i>Prue.</i>

38:51.144 --> 38:53.938
<i>You must face your fears, Prue.</i>

38:54.856 --> 38:59.151
<i>You must trust in the greatest
of all powers: Love.</i>

38:59.443 --> 39:00.486
<i>Mom?</i>

39:01.028 --> 39:03.364
<i>Save yourself.</i>

39:04.115 --> 39:06.367
<i>Save your sister.</i>

39:07.910 --> 39:10.371
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

39:30.641 --> 39:32.059
It's over.

39:42.403 --> 39:45.739
- Your fear.
- I'm not afraid anymore.

39:47.116 --> 39:49.201
No!

40:08.846 --> 40:11.390
Oh, my God. I was so scared.

40:11.557 --> 40:13.642
I know. I'm just glad you're safe.

40:13.809 --> 40:16.603
I don't know what would happen
if I ever lost you.

40:17.646 --> 40:19.481
I love you.

40:19.648 --> 40:22.276
I love you.

40:43.171 --> 40:45.799
Hey, what are you doing?

40:45.966 --> 40:51.763
Kicking myself. I just lost probably
the greatest catch in San Francisco.

40:51.930 --> 40:53.348
What happened?

40:53.515 --> 40:57.602
He doesn't like women who rely on
superstitions to make decisions.

40:57.769 --> 40:59.604
And I'm not so sure he's wrong.

41:00.981 --> 41:04.693
So Prue vanquished
the Demon of Fear.

41:05.276 --> 41:09.155
Well, at least put him back in the bottle
for another 1,300 years.

41:09.322 --> 41:11.783
Wait, whoa, what? What happened?

41:11.950 --> 41:15.453
Well, he pushed her into a pool,
and then...

41:15.787 --> 41:17.664
And Mom helped me out.

41:17.831 --> 41:19.541
Mom?

41:19.707 --> 41:22.836
Okay, I know it sounds crazy,
but I saw her.

41:23.002 --> 41:26.381
It was just like my dream.
She was this incredible vision,

41:26.548 --> 41:29.592
so peaceful, and she took my hand
and brought me to the surface.

41:31.886 --> 41:34.097
It doesn't sound crazy.

41:34.264 --> 41:36.432
- I wish I could've seen her.
- Me too.

41:39.018 --> 41:41.312
I'm just glad you're all right.

41:43.648 --> 41:45.441
I love you.

41:47.985 --> 41:50.321
- What did you just say?
- I love you.

41:54.492 --> 41:56.536
That's the first time
you've ever said that to me.

41:56.702 --> 41:58.037
Yeah, I know.

41:58.204 --> 42:01.040
I wish I would've said it
a long time ago.

42:02.208 --> 42:04.794
Ever since Mom died,
I've been afraid to say it.

42:04.961 --> 42:06.671
I didn't wanna lose anybody else.

42:07.672 --> 42:10.049
Well, we're not going anywhere.

42:13.886 --> 42:17.682
Okay. I'm exhausted.
I'll see you two in the morning.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.860
What happened to her in that pool?

42:30.027 --> 42:33.864
I don't know, but whatever it was,
it must've been incredible.

42:49.713 --> 42:53.092
<i>Thanks for letting them
into your heart.</i>

42:55.928 --> 42:57.930
I miss you, Mom.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
