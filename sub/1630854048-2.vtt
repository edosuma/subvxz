Motherfucker.

00:13.287 --> 00:15.716
Oh, I'm sorry.
You didn't hear that?

00:15.751 --> 00:17.421
Motherfucker!

00:17.456 --> 00:21.689
Fuck you and your moronic
defund-the-police bullshit!

00:21.724 --> 00:24.593
Why? Because you're putting
Trump back into the White House,

Well, aren't you in for a treat?

Yeah. That'll really get people

I'm here to see Julius Cain,
and this was in the elevator.

01:00.829 --> 01:02.400
-Another one?
-Mm.

01:02.435 --> 01:04.567
Tell security it was a man
in camouflage on 18th.

01:04.602 --> 01:06.866
-Could be Antifa,
could be Proud Boys.
-Thanks.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.406
Uh, your name, sir?

01:08.441 --> 01:10.738
-Rahm Emanuel.
-Please take a seat?

01:10.773 --> 01:12.608
Sure.

01:15.382 --> 01:17.613
(playing classical music)

01:17.648 --> 01:19.450
-Eli.
-What is this, a lounge bar?

01:19.485 --> 01:21.221
Do you mind going back
to reception?

01:21.256 --> 01:23.223
I'm just finishing up a call.

01:23.258 --> 01:25.192
No, I'll wait.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.856
What's that about?

01:29.891 --> 01:31.561
JULIUS:
Oh, they're making a documentary
about the top five

01:31.596 --> 01:33.761
Black prosecutors.
Now, will you please

01:33.796 --> 01:35.235
wait in reception?

01:35.270 --> 01:37.303
I'm here
to ask you a small favor.

01:37.338 --> 01:39.272
Eli Gold does not ask
for small favors.

01:39.307 --> 01:40.603
Well, a medium one.

01:40.638 --> 01:42.275
Put Marissa back
on the Lila Royce case.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.607
She was having a bad day.

01:44.642 --> 01:47.247
-That's all.
-Eli, it's a $3 million case.

01:47.282 --> 01:49.711
It's not a training ground
for lawyers.

01:49.746 --> 01:51.185
Look, I'll second chair for her.

01:51.220 --> 01:52.780
Do you even know
what the case is?

01:52.815 --> 01:54.386
A pop star being sued

01:54.421 --> 01:56.520
for not honoring her contract
to play in Israel.

01:56.555 --> 01:59.193
-Right.
-So how can you defend her?

01:59.228 --> 02:01.261
Because I'm Jewish?
That is so anti-Semitic.

02:01.296 --> 02:02.493
O-Okay, okay.

02:02.528 --> 02:03.956
It's not up to me.
It's up to the client.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.794
-Talk to her.
-Good. I'll call her.

02:06.829 --> 02:09.401
Uh, hang on, Eli.

02:09.436 --> 02:11.667
(clears throat)

02:11.702 --> 02:13.405
Marissa was there for me,

02:13.440 --> 02:16.804
so I want to offer you
a bit of advice for her.

02:16.839 --> 02:19.213
Make sure she wins this one.

02:19.248 --> 02:21.479

-(car alarm sounding)

02:21.514 --> 02:24.383
(loud, overlapping shouting)

02:31.953 --> 02:33.623
You ready?

02:33.658 --> 02:36.989
Doctor, I had a near-death
experience recently.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.793
Will that change anything?

02:38.828 --> 02:40.993
-What happened?
-A fake hand grenade

02:41.028 --> 02:42.830
from the protest, but I...

02:42.865 --> 02:45.437
I really thought I was
gonna die, and I went numb.

02:45.472 --> 02:46.900
Well, many people believe

02:46.935 --> 02:50.310
that this treatment
helps you step outside yourself

02:50.345 --> 02:53.247
to examine why
you felt what you did.

02:53.282 --> 02:55.579
So, I don't think
that'll be a problem.

02:55.614 --> 02:57.647
Ready?

02:57.682 --> 02:59.616
I guess.

03:05.019 --> 03:06.755
See you in an hour.

03:11.894 --> 03:14.433
Breathe deeply.

03:14.468 --> 03:16.435
(inhales loudly through nose)

03:16.470 --> 03:17.931
Count back from eight.

03:17.966 --> 03:19.603
Eight.

03:19.638 --> 03:21.605
Seven.

03:21.640 --> 03:22.969
Six.

03:23.004 --> 03:25.543
Five.

03:25.578 --> 03:27.479
Four.

03:27.514 --> 03:28.942
Three...

03:28.977 --> 03:31.582
So, uh, top five
Black prosecutors?

03:31.617 --> 03:33.650
-Yes. It's inspired
by Kamala Harris.
-Mm-hmm.

03:33.685 --> 03:35.355
You know, so many Black women
are looking

03:35.390 --> 03:36.752
for role models today.

03:36.787 --> 03:39.788
Yeah. And, uh, what's it on,
uh, Netflix or...?

03:39.823 --> 03:42.428
-Uh, we're still finding a home.
-Okay, well,

03:42.463 --> 03:44.496
anything for a fellow SGRho.

03:44.531 --> 03:46.025
Oh. It's the way to go.

03:46.060 --> 03:47.697
-Isn't it? (laughs)
-(laughs)

03:47.732 --> 03:49.798
So this is called
an "Interrotron."

03:49.833 --> 03:51.470
Just look right in there.

03:51.505 --> 03:53.604
You'll see my face so you can
just talk right to me.

03:53.639 --> 03:55.606
But on tape, it'll look like
you're talking to the lens.

03:55.641 --> 03:57.641
Sounds great. Uh, perfect.

03:57.676 --> 04:00.710
Okay. So, Ms. Reddick,
did you find

04:00.745 --> 04:03.680
your father's legacy
as a major civil rights activist

04:03.715 --> 04:05.979
to be a burden or an asset
in your job?

04:06.014 --> 04:10.489
Well, my father's reputation
did open some doors.

04:10.524 --> 04:12.854
Was it difficult working
as a prosecutor?

04:12.889 --> 04:14.460
Tell me what you mean?

04:14.495 --> 04:16.792
Convicting people
your dad would've defended.

04:16.827 --> 04:18.662
Well, I, you...

04:18.697 --> 04:20.928
you know, I think that there are
bad people in the world,

04:20.963 --> 04:24.030
and the best way
to protect the good people is

04:24.065 --> 04:25.702
to convict the bad.

04:25.737 --> 04:29.673
Were there any people you were
worried about convicting?

04:29.708 --> 04:31.807
Tell me... I'm sorry.
Tell me what you mean?

04:31.842 --> 04:34.645
Some of the other prosecutors
we interviewed felt sometimes

04:34.680 --> 04:37.384
their superiors,
their white superiors,

04:37.419 --> 04:41.080
required they prosecute even if
they had some hesitations.

04:41.115 --> 04:43.720
Did you have anything like that?

04:44.558 --> 04:48.560
Uh, um... no.

04:49.497 --> 04:52.432
Tell me about the Matthews case.

04:52.467 --> 04:54.126
I'm sorry. The Matthews?

04:54.161 --> 04:56.634
Murder in the first degree,
2008.

04:56.669 --> 04:58.570
Man accused of killing
his pregnant girlfriend.

04:58.605 --> 05:00.770
We're-we're focusing
on one difficult case

05:00.805 --> 05:04.411
with each of the prosecutors
we're profiling, just as a way

05:04.446 --> 05:06.842
to drill down
on struggles in the job.

05:06.877 --> 05:09.350
Can you tell us about it?

05:10.419 --> 05:12.947
You wanted to see me, sir?

05:12.982 --> 05:14.949
Ri'Chard.

05:14.984 --> 05:17.116
Please, sit down, Carmen.

05:17.151 --> 05:20.724
Here, have a Pie Crust Cookie.

05:20.759 --> 05:21.857
My mom made 'em.

05:21.892 --> 05:23.958
No, I'm fine.

05:26.501 --> 05:30.404
We thank You, Jesus,
for this new day.

05:30.439 --> 05:32.131
And thank You
for the opportunity

05:32.166 --> 05:36.476
to reveal Your gifts, and
to help us earn our daily bread.

05:36.511 --> 05:38.940
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

05:38.975 --> 05:40.172
Amen.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.042
(chuckling)

05:42.077 --> 05:46.145
In 1995, I was living
out of my car in Atlanta.

05:46.180 --> 05:47.751
I had nothing.

05:47.786 --> 05:50.754
I used to dig
McDonald's scratch-off cards

05:50.789 --> 05:53.757
out of the trash
to "win" free meals.

05:53.792 --> 05:58.663
Then, one morning,
I found an LSAT study guide,

05:58.698 --> 06:00.060
and I started to read it.

06:00.095 --> 06:02.832
First out of boredom,
then out of interest,

06:02.867 --> 06:06.198
because I thought to myself,
"This, I could do."

06:06.233 --> 06:08.772
I read it cover to cover
three times.

06:08.807 --> 06:11.643
Then I went to the library,
and a man there,

06:11.678 --> 06:13.876
C.J. Howard, saw me
check out a stack of law books

06:13.911 --> 06:17.946
as tall as I was,
and he offered me a job.

06:17.981 --> 06:20.751
As a paralegal
in a local Black law firm.

06:20.786 --> 06:22.786
He didn't do it to be kind.

06:22.821 --> 06:26.592
He told me, "I'm doing this
because I expect you

06:26.627 --> 06:29.463
to make me a million dollars."

06:29.498 --> 06:31.861
And I did.

06:31.896 --> 06:33.797
Now I've been looking
at how much money

06:33.832 --> 06:35.832
you've made
for this firm, Carmen.

06:35.867 --> 06:38.197
You've earned more
than any other associate,

06:38.232 --> 06:40.199
more than 90% of the partners.

06:40.234 --> 06:42.806
And yet, for some reason,
you are still being treated

06:42.841 --> 06:44.907
like a new lawyer
fresh out of law school.

06:44.942 --> 06:47.074
I am a new lawyer
fresh out of law school.

06:47.109 --> 06:49.747
I want to change that!

06:49.782 --> 06:51.551
I want to move you upstairs.

06:51.586 --> 06:53.553
Right there.

06:53.588 --> 06:55.819
-(snapping his fingers)
-Come on in.

06:55.854 --> 06:59.185
These are third-year associates.

06:59.220 --> 07:00.923
They now work for you.

07:00.958 --> 07:03.959
They no longer take commands
from the other partners.

07:03.994 --> 07:07.831
If you want them to grab
your laundry, they'll do it.

07:07.866 --> 07:09.503
Thank you.

07:10.132 --> 07:11.835
Why am I doing this?

07:11.870 --> 07:13.837
I don't expect you
to make me a million dollars.

07:13.872 --> 07:17.236
I expect you
to make me $20 million.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.843
In the first year.

07:19.878 --> 07:25.046
Mr. Lane,
I appreciate the confidence,

07:25.081 --> 07:27.983
but I can't accept all this.

07:28.018 --> 07:29.589
Why?

07:29.624 --> 07:31.888
I don't like
having people work for me.

07:31.923 --> 07:35.122
I don't like having
to explain myself.

07:35.157 --> 07:37.256
Thank you for the office,

07:37.291 --> 07:39.093
but I don't want the attention.

07:39.128 --> 07:41.634
I just want to keep working
the way I've been working.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.670
Carmen,
no one wants the attention,

07:44.705 --> 07:47.739
but Jesus marks some of us

07:47.774 --> 07:50.610
for greater things.

07:50.645 --> 07:53.547
And the attention will come
either way.

07:53.582 --> 07:55.615
Thank you, sir,

07:55.650 --> 07:57.749
but...

07:57.784 --> 08:01.522
I want to remain where I am.

08:03.658 --> 08:05.922
I respect that.

08:05.957 --> 08:08.089
It's good to meet you, Carmen.

08:08.124 --> 08:11.257
Oh, by the way,
do you and Liz not get along?

08:11.292 --> 08:13.259
No. We do.

08:13.294 --> 08:14.898
She's my mentor.

08:14.933 --> 08:16.669
Huh.

08:17.837 --> 08:20.167
I'll be mentoring you
from now on.

08:20.202 --> 08:22.708
What?

08:29.849 --> 08:31.079
Is everything all right?

08:31.114 --> 08:33.653
Yes.
Mr. Lane just wanted to meet.

08:33.688 --> 08:36.315
-Why?
-He wants to mentor me.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.284
Really?

08:38.319 --> 08:40.319
Yes.

08:40.354 --> 08:42.794
You heard we got a new one?

08:42.829 --> 08:44.796
Yes. And it's not just
our building.

08:44.831 --> 08:46.963
All the buildings on the street
are getting grenades.

08:46.998 --> 08:48.668
And they're counting down
to some last protest

08:48.703 --> 08:50.164
-on November 10.
-All right.

08:50.199 --> 08:52.067
Then we need to arrange
for extra security detail,

08:52.102 --> 08:54.806
-especially to escort
our lawyers to their cars.
-Uh-huh.

08:54.841 --> 08:57.105
All right? And can you do
one more thing for me?

08:57.140 --> 09:00.075
Can you look
into a Deandra Minton?

09:00.110 --> 09:03.980
-Who?
-It's this, uh, documentary
that I agreed to.

09:04.015 --> 09:06.180
There's a chance
that it's not all positive.

09:06.215 --> 09:07.654
Tough questions?

09:07.689 --> 09:09.282
Well, she asked a lot
about a case

09:09.317 --> 09:10.855
that I prosecuted 13 years ago.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.956
Matthews. It was...
it was a murder case.

09:12.991 --> 09:15.695
-See you tomorrow.
-All right. Can't wait.

09:15.730 --> 09:17.158
Thanks, guys. Thank you.

09:17.193 --> 09:18.962
Why don't you just
get rid of her?

09:18.997 --> 09:21.734
I-I might be overreacting,
you know?

09:21.769 --> 09:23.901
Okay, I'll see
what I can find out.

09:23.936 --> 09:27.102
-Okay, what's Eli Gold
doing here?
-What?

09:27.137 --> 09:28.972
Eli Gold. He's here.
Do you know why?

09:29.007 --> 09:31.073
-No idea.
-(elevator bell dings)

09:34.144 --> 09:35.715
Okay.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.619
-Daughter!
-Father!

09:39.787 --> 09:42.656
Ah. I'm here to help.
Put me to work.

09:42.691 --> 09:43.921
Well, I need help
lobbying Julius

09:43.956 --> 09:45.252
to put me back
on the Lila Royce case.

09:45.287 --> 09:48.728
Already done.
In fact, I am second chairing.

09:48.763 --> 09:51.390
-You're second chairing? What?
-Mm.

09:51.425 --> 09:54.393
Julius made it a condition.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.769
What are you after, Dad?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.870
Oh, my God, suspicious much?

09:58.905 --> 10:00.432
What I'm after is
proximity to you.

10:00.467 --> 10:02.808
-I don't believe it.
-Well, believe it.

10:02.843 --> 10:04.810
It's what a father does.

10:04.845 --> 10:07.373
Or so I've read.

10:07.408 --> 10:09.782
(birds chirping)

10:11.819 --> 10:13.786
Good morning.

10:13.821 --> 10:15.216
How are you feeling?

10:18.320 --> 10:20.793
I'm good.

10:20.828 --> 10:23.290
Wow. I'm really good.

10:23.325 --> 10:25.699
This armrest is so smooth.

10:25.734 --> 10:27.701
Have you noticed?

10:27.736 --> 10:30.132
Touch it.

10:30.167 --> 10:33.036
I'd say this was
a pretty good first session.

10:33.071 --> 10:35.038
Hold on.

10:35.073 --> 10:36.303
Ooh.

10:36.338 --> 10:38.371
(laughs)
Hello, world.

10:38.406 --> 10:40.076
Mmm.

10:40.111 --> 10:43.277
Shall we go into my office
and discuss it?

10:43.312 --> 10:45.114
Would you like some help up?

10:45.149 --> 10:47.886
Mm, I probably don't need help,
but sure.

10:51.991 --> 10:54.453
Was that plant always there?

10:54.488 --> 10:56.224
Our ficus, yes.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.738
(laughs)

11:04.773 --> 11:06.267
Why? What are you seeing?

11:06.302 --> 11:08.775
(chuckles) Elves.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.403
Oh, those are elves.

11:10.438 --> 11:12.471
Plaster elves
from my secretary's daughter.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.814
Tho-Those are
a school project.

11:19.821 --> 11:22.481
It's important to stay hydrated
throughout the day, Diane.

11:22.516 --> 11:25.187
Six or seven cups
of water ought to do it.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.492
Have you always used
my first name?

11:33.527 --> 11:34.966
I think so.

11:35.001 --> 11:38.497
-Lyle, right?
-That's right.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.499
Would you mind telling me

11:40.534 --> 11:42.776
what you remember
from your experience?

11:44.571 --> 11:47.979
Yeah. I was in a prank.

11:48.014 --> 11:50.245
No. I mean park. (laughs)

11:50.280 --> 11:55.217
Words actually meant the same
backwards as forwards.

11:55.252 --> 11:57.351
Can I have one of those?

11:57.386 --> 11:59.925
Flowers? Certainly.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.158
-Are they real?
-They are.

12:06.164 --> 12:08.802
So, uh,
what happened in the park?

12:08.837 --> 12:11.266
Oh, well, um,
God, I was very charged.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.806
I was with a man.

12:12.841 --> 12:15.875
Not a man I knew.

12:15.910 --> 12:17.877
Wait. Let me think.

12:17.912 --> 12:20.913
Um, yeah, I was
on a p-picnic blanket.

12:20.948 --> 12:23.014
And he had a deep voice.

12:23.049 --> 12:26.281
And it was very beautiful

12:26.316 --> 12:29.284
and erotic, and...

12:29.319 --> 12:32.188
it felt temporary.

12:33.092 --> 12:36.357
Like-like I could blink my eyes,
and it would be gone.

12:36.392 --> 12:39.063
But I didn't mind it.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.166
Something's coming.

12:43.201 --> 12:44.563
Excuse me?

12:44.598 --> 12:46.598
Something's coming.
Something big.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.171
There.

12:48.206 --> 12:50.910
Oh, that's from the protests.

12:50.945 --> 12:53.077
Are they here as well?

12:53.112 --> 12:54.177
Yes.

12:54.212 --> 12:57.279
-(Diane laughs)
-(laughs)

12:57.314 --> 12:59.952
Diane, you're taking a cab
back to the office, right?

12:59.987 --> 13:02.449
-Right-o!
-Good.

13:02.484 --> 13:07.025
You, uh, might experience
some mild vertigo

13:07.060 --> 13:09.489

Ms. Royce, when did you decide

-in the State of Israel?
-I think

it was an apar-thide country.

16:16.381 --> 16:20.482

Um, stuff I read. Podcasts about
the conditions in the Gaza.

16:24.554 --> 16:28.127
Would it be fair to say
that when you agreed

16:28.162 --> 16:30.723
to tour dates in Israel, you had
not yet familiarized yourself

16:30.758 --> 16:32.791
with the political and racial
conditions in the country?

16:32.826 --> 16:35.464

you would not have agreed?

-Never.

do you find objectionable

16:43.705 --> 16:46.244
about the conditions in Gaza,
Ms. Royce?

16:46.279 --> 16:48.378
Uh, well,
the crowding, for starters.

16:48.413 --> 16:50.314
Then you would never perform
in Mumbai?

16:50.349 --> 16:51.810
Come on.

16:51.845 --> 16:53.317
Was that an objection,
Counselor?

-Badgering. Relevancy.
-Overruled.

MARISSA:
So, what, you're plaintiff's
attorney and judge now?

16:56.718 --> 16:58.652
LILA: Well, it's not just
the crowding. It's the way

16:58.687 --> 17:00.126
the Palestinians are treated.

17:00.161 --> 17:02.128
They can't travel
without showing ID.

17:02.163 --> 17:05.428
And when you go to the airport,
do you not have to show an ID?

17:05.463 --> 17:07.793
-That's completely different.
-What about human rights?

17:07.828 --> 17:09.300
Are you aware of the
human rights record of Hamas?

17:09.335 --> 17:10.301

17:12.767 --> 17:14.107
"Objection." How's that, Dad?

hitting Israel every day,

21:18.914 --> 21:20.353

22:09.437 --> 22:11.096
-Deandra's setting you up.
-Aah.

22:11.131 --> 22:12.702
So much for sisterhood.

22:12.737 --> 22:14.440
You might not remember,
but the court started

22:14.475 --> 22:15.870
an on-camera pilot project
back then.

22:15.905 --> 22:18.037
What? So she's seen footage
of the Matthews trial?

22:18.072 --> 22:19.478
She's got all of it.

22:19.513 --> 22:21.106
Well, what the hell
does she want?

22:21.141 --> 22:23.746

<i> Officer Tenny,</i>

22:25.849 --> 22:27.816

22:27.851 --> 22:30.621
<i> -Yes, I did.</i>
<i> -And is this the gun...</i>

22:30.656 --> 22:32.623
God, I was big as a house.

22:32.658 --> 22:34.020
How did I stand up
and sit down?

22:34.055 --> 22:35.560

<i> Yes, it is.</i>

22:35.595 --> 22:37.661
<i> And is this</i>
<i> the ballistics report</i>

22:37.696 --> 22:39.828
<i> on the bullet shells found</i>
<i> at the crime scene?</i>

22:39.863 --> 22:41.698
-I was tougher then.
<i> -TENNY: Yes, ma'am.</i>

22:41.733 --> 22:43.535
-I sounded tougher.
-Yes, I watched it all.

Here's the problem.

22:51.743 --> 22:53.710
Your witness, Officer Tenny--

22:53.745 --> 22:55.943
eight years later, there were
allegations of misconduct.

22:55.978 --> 22:58.649
He's had 12 convictions
overturned so far.

22:58.684 --> 23:00.519
Tenny doesn't matter.

23:00.554 --> 23:01.784
No, this case was clear.

23:01.819 --> 23:03.786
There was physical evidence.

23:03.821 --> 23:06.052
<i> There is right and wrong.</i>

23:06.087 --> 23:08.593

23:16.999 --> 23:19.065
she can edit it
any way she wants.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.804
And I think she wants a story.

23:21.839 --> 23:24.972
And people doing good
is not a story.

Tel Aviv dangerous,

-I was really not aware.

32:45.501 --> 32:48.172
AMY ANN:
How is it
you're outraged by Israel,

32:48.207 --> 32:49.569
the only democracy
in the Middle East,

32:49.604 --> 32:52.737
but totally comfortable
with authoritarian China?

32:52.772 --> 32:55.377
Your Honor, we move for a recess
to confer with our client.

32:55.412 --> 32:56.807
To coach your client, more like.

32:56.842 --> 32:58.347
-Objection.
-This is the first

32:58.382 --> 33:00.085
I've heard
of these concert dates.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.317
I'd like to confirm them
before this line

33:01.352 --> 33:03.088
of questioning
proceeds any further.

33:03.123 --> 33:05.519
Ms. Royce herself says the dates
haven't even been announced yet.

33:05.554 --> 33:07.257
AMY ANN:
Maybe Ms. Royce held
off announcing

33:07.292 --> 33:09.358
her China concerts
because she knows

33:09.393 --> 33:10.722
they make her look
like a hypocrite.

33:10.757 --> 33:13.329
All right, Ms. Howard,
you've made your point.

33:13.364 --> 33:15.265
We'll return tomorrow.

33:15.300 --> 33:19.500
So, she canceled Israel,
but she's still going to China?

33:19.535 --> 33:22.140
Look, we just need to confirm
if these dates are true.

33:22.175 --> 33:23.504
Seems pretty hypocritical
to me. Hmm.

33:23.539 --> 33:25.341
Well, what country doesn't have
some corruption?

33:25.376 --> 33:26.837
Where are artists supposed
to perform? Not in Florida.

33:26.872 --> 33:29.675
-Guys, I just need confirmation.
-DEVIN: But China? Come on.

33:29.710 --> 33:31.611
It's genocide. The Uyghurs
are being forcibly sterilized.

33:31.646 --> 33:33.745
When did Lila become
so political anyway?

33:33.780 --> 33:35.615
-DEVIN: Right.
-LUCY: Israel's occupation
of Palestine

33:35.650 --> 33:37.419
is directly connected to money
and power in this country.

33:37.454 --> 33:38.849
-DEVIN: Oh, my God.
-LEAH: Look, the point is that

33:38.884 --> 33:41.159
-Jews have a lot
of power and money.
-Seriously?

33:41.194 --> 33:42.622
-Okay. What?
-DEVIN: Oh, my God.

33:42.657 --> 33:44.426
How are you doing
on those Protocols of Zion?

33:44.461 --> 33:46.164
-Thank you!
-LEAH: Okay, well, then, so,

33:46.199 --> 33:47.330
why don't you guys prove
that it's not true?

33:47.365 --> 33:49.266
-Oh, my God.
-Don't get me started on

33:49.301 --> 33:51.433
-Black-Jewish relations.
-Excuse me?

33:51.468 --> 33:53.105
-What?
-Jewish people played a big role
in civil rights.

33:53.140 --> 33:54.799
-You got to give 'em that.
-And funded the slave trade.

33:54.834 --> 33:56.735
-What?
-And what about
the Crown Heights Riot?

33:56.770 --> 33:59.705
DEVIN:
Forced labor!
One million Uyghurs being forced

33:59.740 --> 34:01.179
-to pick cotton.
-Cotton?

34:01.214 --> 34:02.378
-That is not true!
-It is. Look online.

34:02.413 --> 34:04.578
Okay. Thank you, guys.

34:04.613 --> 34:06.283
I think I've got this.

34:09.255 --> 34:11.849
Uh, can I take the case
when you're done?

34:11.884 --> 34:13.851
The Lila case. Can I take it?

34:13.886 --> 34:15.886
What are you talking about?

34:15.921 --> 34:18.229
Oh. Uh, nothing.

34:18.264 --> 34:20.396
Maybe you didn't...

34:20.431 --> 34:22.299
Nothing.

34:24.369 --> 34:26.336
I'm still not finding anything.

34:26.371 --> 34:27.733
I think
I'd better call Lila's manager.

34:27.768 --> 34:29.471
What's going on, Dad?

34:29.506 --> 34:31.638
I'm just checking to see if
those Chinese dates were real.

34:31.673 --> 34:34.245
No. An associate just asked
if she could have the case

34:34.280 --> 34:36.247
once I'm off it.
What's that mean?

34:38.812 --> 34:41.615
(clears throat)

34:41.650 --> 34:46.224
Julius said that
your Judge Wackner stuff

34:46.259 --> 34:47.753
put you in a bad position
with the firm.

34:47.788 --> 34:50.195
-"My" Judge Wackner...
-They're looking for an excuse

34:50.230 --> 34:53.231
to dump you, so we've got to
keep pushing forward with this.

34:53.266 --> 34:56.201
Oh, my God. I've been a lawyer
for a week, and I've been fired.

34:56.236 --> 34:58.599
You're not fired.
You're-you're...

34:58.634 --> 35:01.734
you're a new lawyer.
You're... you're learning.

35:01.769 --> 35:04.671
(cries)

35:04.706 --> 35:06.838
Oh, baby.

35:06.873 --> 35:08.906
(sighs)

35:08.941 --> 35:11.513
I'm just tired. I really want
to be good at this.

35:11.548 --> 35:13.251
-You<i> are</i> good at it.
-(sighs)

35:13.286 --> 35:15.946
It's just so hard.

35:15.981 --> 35:17.948
-Hmm.
-(sniffles)

35:17.983 --> 35:19.554
I'm going to tell you something

35:19.589 --> 35:22.293
I first told you
in the third grade.

35:24.627 --> 35:26.924
Life is hard

35:26.959 --> 35:29.300
because people are assholes.

35:29.335 --> 35:32.567
-(Marissa laughs)
-(Eli laughs)

35:34.901 --> 35:37.605
Ms. Minton, I have no patience
left for games.

35:37.640 --> 35:40.212
Exactly what kind of evidence
do you think you have

35:40.247 --> 35:41.642
with this Matthews case?

35:41.677 --> 35:43.809
The friendship bracelet.
Found in the hallway.

35:43.844 --> 35:45.811
The issue was never resolved
at the time. It's a huge

35:45.846 --> 35:47.549
-question mark.
-JULIUS: That sounds like

35:47.584 --> 35:49.848
a low-rent game of Clue.
Is that all you have?

35:49.883 --> 35:52.884
Officer Tenny. Did you know
he was corrupt at the time?

35:52.919 --> 35:55.458
-Of course not.
-Someone's suggesting
you did know.

35:55.493 --> 35:59.462
From an interview I did
with a coworker of yours.

36:00.630 --> 36:01.696
<i> I told Liz.</i>

36:01.731 --> 36:04.434
<i> I felt I had</i>
<i> to warn her about Tenny--</i>

36:04.469 --> 36:06.733
<i> that he had a bad reputation.</i>

36:08.440 --> 36:10.000
Did he? Warn you?

36:10.035 --> 36:11.573
Hello, Brian.

36:11.608 --> 36:13.674
I knew I shouldn't have talked
to that girl.

36:13.709 --> 36:15.478
You totally
threw me under the bus.

36:15.513 --> 36:17.546
-I didn't, I swear.
-Telling her

36:17.581 --> 36:19.845
that I knew
that Officer Tenny was corrupt?

36:19.880 --> 36:21.451
That-That's not what I said.

36:21.486 --> 36:23.387
Not exactly.
But come on, Liz.

36:23.422 --> 36:25.488
We talked about how sketchy
Tenny was back then.

36:25.523 --> 36:28.326
-And we were right.
-But we didn't know.

36:28.361 --> 36:29.921
Otherwise, we would have
never have used him.

36:29.956 --> 36:31.923
That's what I said
in my interview.

36:31.958 --> 36:33.661
We knew
the evidence was strong.

36:33.696 --> 36:36.763
Our case was good. I told her
you would never play dirty.

36:36.798 --> 36:37.995
You never did.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.832
You said that?

36:39.867 --> 36:41.669
Of course I did. It's the truth.

36:41.704 --> 36:46.575
Yeah. Well, I don't think
she's going to use that part.

36:46.610 --> 36:48.676
I'm sorry.

36:48.711 --> 36:50.942
I would never do anything
to hurt you intentionally.

36:50.977 --> 36:52.680
Just unintentionally.

36:52.715 --> 36:54.319
Hey, you got out.

36:54.354 --> 36:55.749
You run a big firm now.

36:55.784 --> 36:57.916
Okay.

36:57.951 --> 37:01.920
Then you need to get me access
to that old case file.

37:01.955 --> 37:04.054
I don't know.

37:04.089 --> 37:08.025
Brian! You owe me.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.962
Of course we arranged a concert
in China. A goodwill concert.

37:10.997 --> 37:13.536
Art and music are the best way
to bring people together.

37:13.571 --> 37:14.933
Is this contract ironclad?

37:14.968 --> 37:16.935
-Is there no exception
for moral qualms?
-No!

37:16.970 --> 37:19.575
But even if there were,
we don't want out of this.

37:19.610 --> 37:21.610
Lila has 13 million more fans
in China.

37:21.645 --> 37:22.776
Well, she can't play China
if we're claiming

37:22.811 --> 37:24.349
she has moral objections
to Israel.

37:24.384 --> 37:25.878
BO: Of course she can.
Just 'cause Lila

37:25.913 --> 37:27.484
doesn't like one injustice
doesn't mean

37:27.519 --> 37:28.914
she has to hate all injustice.

37:28.949 --> 37:31.620
-China is worse than Israel.
-That's your perspective.

37:31.655 --> 37:33.523
Lila, have you heard
about the concentration camps?

37:33.558 --> 37:35.525
Hold on. You're her lawyers,
not her guardian angels.

37:35.560 --> 37:37.758
We can't win this
unless we are consistent.

37:37.793 --> 37:39.430
Lila brings a message
of peace with her.

37:39.465 --> 37:41.663
You want her to negate
a third of her audience?

37:41.698 --> 37:43.533
Lila, this is all just
about making money in China.

37:43.568 --> 37:45.601
No, not money. People don't
make money in China.

37:45.636 --> 37:47.603
People make fortunes in China.

37:47.638 --> 37:49.605
So money cleanses everything?
Is that it?

37:49.640 --> 37:51.343
No. Money only cleanses
everything if it's enough money.

37:51.378 --> 37:53.906
(large explosion)

37:53.941 --> 37:57.580
Look, China's bad.

37:57.615 --> 37:59.043
So is Israel.
So is America.

37:59.078 --> 38:02.486
We're all on the same page,
and Lila's an artist.

38:02.521 --> 38:04.950
So... let her sing her truth.

38:04.985 --> 38:06.622
<i> Objection, Your Honor!</i>

38:06.657 --> 38:08.789
<i> Misstates the evidence</i>
<i> and lacks a question.</i>

38:08.824 --> 38:10.956
Memory is weird.

38:10.991 --> 38:12.793
You see his smile?

38:12.828 --> 38:14.960
When I saw that,
it all came back.

38:14.995 --> 38:16.764
-What did?
-The other cops,

38:16.799 --> 38:19.129
including the one that I was
married to at the time--

38:19.164 --> 38:20.603
they all talked about Tenny.

38:20.638 --> 38:21.967
Well, there's always talk.

38:22.002 --> 38:23.441
Yeah, but what if...

38:23.476 --> 38:24.970
What if I brushed it all off

38:25.005 --> 38:27.104
because I needed the police
to do their job

38:27.139 --> 38:28.809
so that I could succeed at mine?

38:28.844 --> 38:30.778
Liz, you can't attack
your younger self

38:30.813 --> 38:32.516
with information
that y-you're only getting now.

38:32.551 --> 38:33.847
If I did that,
I'd never get out of bed.

38:33.882 --> 38:35.981
-He was corrupt.
-(helicopter whirring)

38:36.016 --> 38:37.851
Well, did you know that then?

38:37.886 --> 38:40.755
Or does it only feel
like you should have?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.991
Oh, 'cause...
What do I do?

38:46.026 --> 38:49.401
Do I... do I continue
this interview, or do I stop?

38:49.436 --> 38:50.963
<i> LILA:</i>
<i> What's up, Lila-ites?</i>

38:50.998 --> 38:55.407
<i> I'm just wondering, like,</i>
<i> why are people so mean?</i>

38:55.442 --> 38:58.003
<i> I just read some really</i>
<i> triggering posts about China,</i>

38:58.038 --> 39:01.479
<i> about the Uyghurs and</i>
<i>a tennis player and some actors.</i>

39:01.514 --> 39:03.646
<i> And I'm just feeling like...</i>

39:03.681 --> 39:05.615
<i> we need to do better.</i>

39:05.650 --> 39:08.112
<i> Love you all.</i>
<i> Peace and love.</i>

39:08.147 --> 39:10.048
We did not know, Bo.

39:10.083 --> 39:12.853
Fuck you. It doesn't matter if
you knew. You made her do this.

39:12.888 --> 39:14.624
Your girl posted that video
on her own.

39:14.659 --> 39:16.428
We were not consulted,
we did not advise.

39:16.463 --> 39:17.891
Did you not think
of having a conversation

39:17.926 --> 39:19.497
regarding the subject?

39:19.532 --> 39:22.060
-What subject? China?
-Yes! China!

39:22.095 --> 39:24.535
You don't like the way the
Israelis treat the Palestinians,

39:24.570 --> 39:27.769
the way the Serbs treat
the Croats, or the way

39:27.804 --> 39:29.771
the Eskimos treat
the baby fucking seals,

39:29.806 --> 39:32.004
blow off those dates,
but do not...

39:32.039 --> 39:33.973
do not fuck with China!

39:34.008 --> 39:36.547
But did it not bother you,
never finding out

39:36.582 --> 39:38.648
who the owner
of that friendship bracelet was?

39:38.683 --> 39:41.486
That person was
potentially another suspect.

39:41.521 --> 39:43.917
There was never anything
that suggested

39:43.952 --> 39:45.919
that the bracelet
had anything to do

39:45.954 --> 39:47.921
-with Stephen Matthews
or the murder.
-But it did

39:47.956 --> 39:50.220
suggest someone else might've
been present at some point.

39:50.255 --> 39:53.762
In a hallway in an apartment
building. Entirely possible.

39:53.797 --> 39:56.831
So there are
unanswered questions.

39:58.164 --> 39:59.966
Deandra, what are you doing?

40:00.001 --> 40:03.233
-I'm trying to find the truth.
-No, you're not.

40:03.268 --> 40:04.674
You're not,

40:04.709 --> 40:06.511
because if the truth

40:06.546 --> 40:07.677
really mattered to you,
you wouldn't have

40:07.712 --> 40:10.207
lied to me
when you first got here--

40:10.242 --> 40:12.616
calling me a role model
and using

40:12.651 --> 40:14.618
our sorority sisterhood bonds
so that you could get me

40:14.653 --> 40:16.246
to lower my guard
so that you could do to me

40:16.281 --> 40:17.951
-what they've been doing
to Kamala.
-Look, I admit

40:17.986 --> 40:19.689
I didn't share everything
with you,

40:19.724 --> 40:21.185
but sometimes,
justice requires you...

40:21.220 --> 40:23.088
You are not here for justice.

40:23.123 --> 40:26.091
You're here about entertainment,
and you know how I know?

40:26.126 --> 40:28.731
Because we're not even talking
about Officer Tenny

40:28.766 --> 40:30.733
and whether he lied.

40:30.768 --> 40:34.099
Because you're so fixated
on a fucking friendship bracelet

40:34.134 --> 40:37.069
that was found 50 feet
from the crime scene,

40:37.104 --> 40:39.269
even though
there was a mountain of evidence

40:39.304 --> 40:41.513
right at the suspect's feet.

40:41.548 --> 40:44.714
Why? Because it's visual.

40:44.749 --> 40:46.716
Because you want
the audience to think

40:46.751 --> 40:50.852
that you found something
that everybody else overlooked.

40:50.887 --> 40:53.954
So, congratulations.
You found QAnon.

40:53.989 --> 40:56.990
-Can I talk now?
-You know,
you're a very smart young woman,

40:57.025 --> 40:58.860
and you could do a lot of good
in this world.

40:58.895 --> 41:01.126
But you're not doing the truth.

41:01.161 --> 41:03.733
The phone call
that didn't get connected,

41:03.768 --> 41:05.867
or-or the dog
that barked a mile away--

41:05.902 --> 41:08.903
all of these are irrelevant.

41:08.938 --> 41:12.170
Life is filled
with irrelevant shit.

41:12.205 --> 41:15.074
But you-- you're trying
to shove it all together

41:15.109 --> 41:16.911
to make us believe

41:16.946 --> 41:21.212
that someone that the jury found
guilty was wrongly convicted.

41:21.247 --> 41:23.720
You know, I-I would actually
have more respect for you

41:23.755 --> 41:25.590
if you thought
you were righting a wrong.

41:25.625 --> 41:27.559
-I am. I...
-No, you're not.

41:27.594 --> 41:29.187
Because if you were,

41:29.222 --> 41:33.598
you wouldn't be fixated on all
the visual pieces of evidence.

41:33.633 --> 41:36.095
So you know what?

41:41.069 --> 41:42.574
Here's the old case file.

41:42.609 --> 41:44.301
Read it,

41:44.336 --> 41:46.303
review it,

41:46.338 --> 41:48.745
and then we'll talk.

41:56.689 --> 41:58.887
Don't steal from me.

41:58.922 --> 42:00.724
Okay.

42:00.759 --> 42:03.793
Um, can you tell me
how I'm stealing from you?

42:03.828 --> 42:06.191
You are not Carmen's mentor.
I am.

42:06.226 --> 42:07.896
I was just noticing how little

42:07.931 --> 42:09.997
-you and Carmen care
for each other.
-I work

42:10.032 --> 42:12.164
with a lot of people that
I don't necessarily care for.

42:12.199 --> 42:14.804
-Back off.
-My mistake.

42:14.839 --> 42:18.071
I am officially
backing the fuck off.

42:18.106 --> 42:20.337
You know, we need to figure out
how we're gonna work together.

42:20.372 --> 42:22.009
Please.

42:23.012 --> 42:24.374
(chuckles)

42:24.409 --> 42:27.850
Oh, yeah, my mom used
to make Pie Crust Cookies, too.

42:27.885 --> 42:30.347
Yeah?

42:30.382 --> 42:32.382
Have one.

42:32.417 --> 42:34.824
Thank you.

42:37.730 --> 42:39.158
Hmm-mm.

42:39.193 --> 42:40.962
No. These are store-bought.

42:40.997 --> 42:42.230
No, they are not.

42:42.265 --> 42:45.197
You cannot fake your way through
this. These are store-bought.

42:45.232 --> 42:47.639
Uh, can you step out a sec?

42:49.269 --> 42:51.709
How do we work together?

42:51.744 --> 42:53.711
By being truthful.

42:53.746 --> 42:54.910
And how do we do that?

42:54.945 --> 42:56.945
Don't treat me like an idiot.

42:56.980 --> 42:58.342
I can see right through you.

42:58.377 --> 43:00.784
Being partners is
a numbers game.

43:00.819 --> 43:04.854
So, don't go after Diane,
I am Carmen's mentor,

43:04.889 --> 43:07.989
and you can have your
15 associates, and that's it.

43:08.024 --> 43:09.826
Okay.

43:09.861 --> 43:12.994
-Let's pray.
-Oh, yes. Dear Lord,

43:13.029 --> 43:16.327
Father God, dear Lord, help us

43:16.362 --> 43:21.002
to work together to bring this
firm to even greater success.

43:21.037 --> 43:24.940
Dear Lord, help Ri'Chard
to know his place.

43:24.975 --> 43:29.076
And help him to see
that I am not the enemy.

43:29.111 --> 43:31.815
And, dear Lord, help us
to work together

43:31.850 --> 43:35.049
that we may advance Your will.

43:35.920 --> 43:39.185
In Jesus' name we pray.

43:39.220 --> 43:41.957
-Amen.
-Amen.

43:45.732 --> 43:48.128
Now don't fuck with me.

43:51.870 --> 43:54.002
(door closes)

43:54.037 --> 43:55.971
(sighs)

44:00.813 --> 44:02.879
We represent
Lila Royce's record label.

44:02.914 --> 44:04.749
Are you
her responsible attorneys?

44:04.784 --> 44:05.915
-Actually...
-What do you want?

44:05.950 --> 44:07.444
We need Lila
to make a formal apology

44:07.479 --> 44:08.951
to the Chinese people.

44:08.986 --> 44:11.283
-That's not gonna happen.
-We'll provide the text.

44:11.318 --> 44:13.890
Any changes to the text will
have to be approved in advance.

44:13.925 --> 44:15.320
Did you not hear
what she just said?

44:15.355 --> 44:16.794
SIMON:
I did. Said apology

44:16.829 --> 44:18.455
will be prerecorded on video

44:18.490 --> 44:21.029
and played across all platforms
currently authorized

44:21.064 --> 44:22.492
by the Chinese government.

44:22.527 --> 44:24.230
What's the gist
of this apology?

44:24.265 --> 44:25.902
That her recent statements

44:25.937 --> 44:28.773
demonstrated a lack
of understanding

44:28.808 --> 44:30.269
regarding
China's ethnic minorities,

44:30.304 --> 44:33.338
a lack of understanding common
in former colonial powers.

44:33.373 --> 44:36.473
That she has come to understand
that the government of China

44:36.508 --> 44:39.245
is acting in the best interests
of all its citizens

44:39.280 --> 44:41.346
and supports a spirit
of friendship

44:41.381 --> 44:43.282
with the West
while rejecting any attempt

44:43.317 --> 44:45.284
to interfere
with internal Chinese policies.

44:45.319 --> 44:47.484
-That's total bullshit.
-Should she refuse

44:47.519 --> 44:49.090
to deliver this apology,

44:49.125 --> 44:50.960
her recording contract
will be renewed

44:50.995 --> 44:53.358
per the one-way option
currently held by the label,

44:53.393 --> 44:56.361
but no recordings will be
either made or released.

44:56.396 --> 44:58.968
She will be prevented from
signing with any other label

44:59.003 --> 45:00.431
for a period of 11 years.

45:00.466 --> 45:03.236
I guess you don't mind
getting sued, do you?

45:03.271 --> 45:05.007
(scoffs)
Not a bit.

45:05.042 --> 45:07.306
Lila will never do it.
She's got her principles,

45:07.341 --> 45:08.846
and she won't be bullied...

45:08.881 --> 45:11.882
<i> What's up, Lila-ites?</i>
<i> (sighs heavily)</i>

45:11.917 --> 45:13.983
<i> I was a bit too hasty</i>
<i> with my last post.</i>

45:14.018 --> 45:15.985
<i> I did a little more research,</i>

45:16.020 --> 45:17.987
<i> and I've fallen in love</i>
<i> with China again.</i>

45:18.022 --> 45:20.990
<i> I love the people,</i>
<i> I love the history,</i>

45:21.025 --> 45:23.256
<i> and I love the fans,</i>

45:23.291 --> 45:28.030
<i> which is why</i>
<i> I will be performing in China,</i>

45:28.065 --> 45:31.561
<i> the most beautiful country</i>
<i> in the world.</i>

45:31.596 --> 45:34.168
<i> (speaking Mandarin)</i>

45:35.435 --> 45:37.875
(sirens blaring outside)

45:37.910 --> 45:40.339
(helicopter whirring)

45:40.374 --> 45:43.342
-(distant explosion)
-(car alarm blaring)

45:43.377 --> 45:46.818
My little girl,
a counselor-at-law.

45:46.853 --> 45:48.281
Who didn't win.

45:48.316 --> 45:50.283
Your client was happy.
That's all that matters.

45:50.318 --> 45:52.054
(sighs)
I suppose it's appropriate

45:52.089 --> 45:54.386
that a case involving Israel
ended in a settlement.

45:54.421 --> 45:56.223
(Eli chuckles)

45:56.258 --> 45:59.358
I know I was tough on you,
but...

45:59.393 --> 46:02.999
listen, I was very impressed
with how you handled yourself.

46:03.034 --> 46:05.496
Dad, you don't have to say
something just to be nice.

46:05.531 --> 46:08.235
When did I ever do that?

46:08.270 --> 46:10.534
You're a damn good lawyer,
Marissa.

46:10.569 --> 46:13.306
So good, I'd like to hire you.

46:13.341 --> 46:15.308
What?

46:15.343 --> 46:17.376
I'd like you
to join my legal team.

46:17.411 --> 46:18.916
For what?

46:18.951 --> 46:20.445
Some little matter
I have to deal with.

46:20.480 --> 46:22.887
A-A campaign thing. Uh...

46:23.582 --> 46:25.351
I'm being indicted for fraud.

46:25.386 --> 46:27.419
-That's what this was all about?
-There was

46:27.454 --> 46:29.256
the possibility
you might be subpoenaed,

46:29.291 --> 46:31.258
but now that you're my lawyer,
you can't be.

46:31.293 --> 46:34.162
-Oh, my God.
And I thought you were real.
-I am real.

46:34.197 --> 46:35.933
You just did this so that
I couldn't be subpoenaed?

46:35.968 --> 46:37.935
Marissa... you matter to me.

46:37.970 --> 46:41.169
No, I don't.
My testimony matters to you.

46:41.204 --> 46:43.908
-We're family, baby.
-When you need me.

46:43.943 --> 46:45.877
Well, it's a good thing
I always need you.

46:46.506 --> 46:48.913
See you tomorrow, babe.

46:49.641 --> 46:52.180
Babe?

46:53.018 --> 46:55.183
-(sirens wailing outside)
-And the-the expression

46:55.218 --> 46:58.186
on her face when I told her
to read the damn file.

46:58.221 --> 47:00.892
(chuckles)
I'm not gonna lie.

47:00.927 --> 47:02.927
That felt good.

47:02.962 --> 47:05.061
(chuckles)
Here's to saving the world

47:05.096 --> 47:07.360
-from one more
lousy documentary.
-Yeah.

47:09.661 --> 47:11.298
LIZ:
Mm.

47:11.333 --> 47:14.631
(distant fire truck horn
blaring)

47:14.666 --> 47:16.633
Are you all right?

47:16.668 --> 47:19.570
(Diane sighs)

47:19.605 --> 47:21.572
My mother died at my age.

47:21.607 --> 47:23.948
Well, then, she died young.

47:24.577 --> 47:27.644
I'd forgotten she was my age
until this morning,

47:27.679 --> 47:31.285
and now I can't get the thought
out of my head.

47:32.717 --> 47:34.684
LIZ:
Mm.

47:34.719 --> 47:36.455
No one said she died young.

47:36.490 --> 47:39.062
Well, but "young" and "old"
don't mean the same thing

47:39.097 --> 47:40.525
that they used to.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.595
And-and nobody is younger
than Diane Lockhart.

47:44.630 --> 47:46.938
(loud, indistinct shouting
outside)

47:47.567 --> 47:49.567
Diane?

47:49.602 --> 47:52.438
God, I just remembered
I'm not supposed to drink.

47:52.473 --> 47:54.011
Why?

47:54.046 --> 47:55.705
I'm on medication.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.443
Are you dizzy?

48:00.448 --> 48:02.921
No.

48:06.025 --> 48:08.190
Okay.

48:15.001 --> 48:17.232
I got to go home.

48:26.573 --> 48:29.145
(indistinct shouting outside)

48:32.183 --> 48:34.348
(shouting outside continues)
