MALE VOICE: Global Dynamics,
cryogenics, access granted.

00:14.973 --> 00:17.305
Guys, how much longer?

00:17.643 --> 00:19.679
There are people
trying to sleep.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.135
(LAUGHING)

00:21.313 --> 00:22.894
Only two more to go.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.896
These probably date back
to the '50s.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.143
Don't make 'em
like this anymore.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.979
Which is why
we're replacing them.

00:28.070 --> 00:30.686
It's an out-of-date design,
just like your haircut.

00:30.781 --> 00:31.816
(CHUCKLING SARCASTICALLY)

00:31.907 --> 00:32.987
(BEEPING)

00:33.033 --> 00:34.614
What is that?

00:34.660 --> 00:35.991
I don't know.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.825
(BEEPING CONTINUES)

00:37.871 --> 00:39.407
I thought this one
was empty.

00:39.498 --> 00:40.988
It's supposed to be.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.336
No way.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.007
Did you get it?
Yeah, hand it over. Come on.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.835
Come on, come on,
come on.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.350
Double-shot Vinspresso.

00:59.393 --> 01:00.724
Do not tell him.

01:00.811 --> 01:02.551
Not if he tortured me.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.595
(CLEARING THROAT)

01:05.065 --> 01:06.396
Nice try.

01:06.525 --> 01:07.605
Dad, come on.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.524
No, a dozen. Uh-huh.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.983
Long... Long-stemmed.
Okay, thanks.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.235
Who are the flowers for?

01:16.326 --> 01:18.362
(SNIFFING)
None of your business.

01:18.412 --> 01:23.873
This is Vincent's coffee.
Vincent knows not
to supply you.

01:26.712 --> 01:30.170
Oh, you have a middleman.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.215
You'll never break me.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.857
"Sassy pumps for fall."

01:53.572 --> 01:55.813
I'm so ashamed.

01:55.907 --> 01:57.317
Dealing to minors.

01:57.409 --> 01:58.865
Coffee's not a drug, Dad.

01:58.910 --> 02:00.241
Well, then, you can quit it
whenever you want,

02:00.329 --> 02:01.910
so no driving lessons
until you do.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.955
But...
No! No "buts."

02:05.042 --> 02:09.206
I love you too
much to watch you
do this to yourself.

02:09.921 --> 02:10.956
Mmm.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.413
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

02:12.674 --> 02:14.414
Lupo. Sure.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.462
It's Allison.

02:16.553 --> 02:18.009
(CARTER SIGHING)

02:19.264 --> 02:20.253
Jack Carter.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.589
Oh, hey. It's me.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.757
Yeah.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.723
Okay, well, we have a bit of
an unusual situation up here.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.930
Wow, at Global Dynamics,
imagine...

02:30.275 --> 02:33.438
Well, this one's
unprecedented, even for us.

02:33.528 --> 02:36.440
What do you want me to do,
evacuate the town?

02:36.531 --> 02:38.487
Okay, I get it.
You're still mad at me.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.987
How long are you going
to punish me for this?

02:41.078 --> 02:42.739
Wow.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.033
I'm just trying to do my job.
I'll be there shortly.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.411
(SIGHING)

02:49.961 --> 02:51.246
What was that about?

02:51.296 --> 02:54.538
Nothing. Got to go.
We'll talk consequences later.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.632
BOTH: Can't wait.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.341
He broke me like a stick.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.514
Which will make revenge
that much sweeter.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.966
He left his cell phone.

03:06.061 --> 03:07.267
JO: Well, what are you
gonna do?

03:07.312 --> 03:09.098
Oh, I don't know.
Getting as much coffee

03:09.147 --> 03:11.433
and driving lessons,
as I want.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.311
Hi, yes. I'm calling for
my boss, Jack Carter.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.320
I believe he just
ordered flowers.

03:19.366 --> 03:23.279
Right. Well, Ijust need
to verify the spelling
of the name?

03:23.578 --> 03:26.615
Okay. Yeah, that's right.
Thank you.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.535
Who the hell's
Angela Fairfield?

03:34.089 --> 03:37.047
ALLISON: Okay, Carter,
can we talk about this?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.501
I don't...

03:42.431 --> 03:44.171
I don't know what to say.

03:44.266 --> 03:47.008
I mean,
you withheld information

03:47.102 --> 03:50.139
that Stark's device could be
causing the shared dreaming.

03:50.188 --> 03:51.849
| apologized for that.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.389
Allison, I'mjust gonna
be mad for a while.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.851
Okay?

03:59.072 --> 04:00.187
Okay.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.360
So, what's the emergency?

04:06.413 --> 04:08.745
We're updating the equipment
in cryogenics.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.120
(CHUCKLING) Thank God.
A number of people have
elected to go into cryostasis

04:12.210 --> 04:14.542
over the years,
going back to the 1950s.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.005
Cryostasis?

04:16.047 --> 04:18.754
Cold-stored,
to be revived at a later date,

04:18.842 --> 04:22.209
ideally after we've found
the cure for whatever disease
they were dying from.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.171
Creepy, yes,
but I don't think that
falls under my jurisdiction.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.554
Well, we've
discovered a person

04:26.641 --> 04:29.474
in an unmarked chamber,
a very old chamber.

04:29.561 --> 04:31.176
Okay, so G.D. put some food
in the freezer

04:31.229 --> 04:33.060
without labeling it,
and now it's mystery meat.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.388
Still seems like
an internal problem.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.348
There's a little more to it
than that, Carter.
Like?

04:36.401 --> 04:39.063
Like the fact that
this one has a heartbeat.

04:45.702 --> 04:46.862
(CARTER SIGHING)

04:46.912 --> 04:48.197
What's he
doing here?

04:48.246 --> 04:50.237
Nathan's early research
was in cryogenics.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.288
(SIGHING) Of course it was.
How's it going?

04:52.375 --> 04:53.911
We are monitoring
the frost rate.

04:54.002 --> 04:56.914
Opening the chambers too
quickly could destabilize
his tissues.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.589
I can't believe this is
happening in my lifetime,
right here, right now.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.750
Fargo, don't hurt yourself.
No, no, you don't understand.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.880
This is history in the making.
The first person ever

05:04.930 --> 05:06.420
to come out of
cryostasis alive.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.553
His pulse is dropping.

05:07.641 --> 05:08.881
All right, we've got to
get him out of there.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.425
I need all medical personnel
standing by.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.723
Ready to make history, Henry?

05:17.776 --> 05:19.186
Hit it.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.191
Why is he standing
backwards?

05:24.282 --> 05:25.613
Why is he fully clothed?

05:25.700 --> 05:29.943
His pulse is slow, but stable.
His vital signs look strong.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.283
Okay, get him out of there.

05:33.416 --> 05:34.792
Gently.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.326
All righty,
lift him up.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.962
We need to get him
up to the infirmary.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.331
Hold on.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.632
Pierre Fargo.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.389
Grandpa?

06:37.355 --> 06:39.266
All my life, I thought
he ran out on my grandma,

06:39.357 --> 06:41.348
and he's been
right here all along.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.642
Of all people to bring
out of cryostasis,

06:43.695 --> 06:45.401
| resurrect another Fargo.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.399
Yeah, karma's a bitch.

06:47.490 --> 06:52.029
Hey, is anyone curious
as to how he got in there?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.406
He's a Fargo.
Are you really surprised?

06:54.497 --> 06:57.034
I am standing right here.
He just twitched.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.706
I think he might have
heard you.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.083
Belle.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.377
No, I'm Allison Blake.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.173
Do you know your name?

07:04.215 --> 07:08.879
Everyone knows my name.
I'm Pierre Fargo,
the Pierre Fargo.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.385
Do you know the date, Pierre?

07:10.472 --> 07:13.339
I prefer Dr. Fargo,
thank you.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.759
And, yes,
it's August 30, 1957.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.718
Did I hit my head
or something?

07:18.813 --> 07:22.772
You're at Global Dynamics.
You've been asleep
for a while.

07:22.859 --> 07:26.397
Does anyone know the time,
because my girl Belle and |

07:26.488 --> 07:28.353
have dinner plans
and I can't be late.

07:28.448 --> 07:32.157
I don't know how to say this.
You're already late.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.363
Like, 50 years late.

07:34.412 --> 07:35.401
Excuse me?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.579
Pierre, you just woke up
from cryostasis.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.407
Sure I did.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.242
I know this may be difficult
to process...

07:42.337 --> 07:45.955
But you've been in cryostasis
since 1957.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.914
The year is 2007.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.628
There's no way
you're convincing me

07:49.719 --> 07:52.335
that I just woke up
50 years in the future.

07:53.932 --> 07:55.718
Put your glasses on.

07:56.935 --> 07:58.471
(SIGHING) Okay.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.179
That's better.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.666
I'm Douglas Fargo.
I'm your grandson.

08:28.091 --> 08:31.675
Imagine waking up and
everything you know is gone.

08:31.761 --> 08:33.547
Nathan's gonna keep him
under observation

08:33.638 --> 08:35.299
until we're sure
that he's stabilized.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.597
From cryogenics
to babysitting?

08:37.642 --> 08:39.382
Sheriff Carter?
Yeah.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.138
Hey, Fargo,
how you doing?

08:41.229 --> 08:42.594
Better than my granddad.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.059
Listen, I know Fargos
have a reputation

08:45.150 --> 08:47.061
for being in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

08:47.152 --> 08:50.644
but if he says
he doesn't know
how he got into that chamber,

08:50.739 --> 08:53.321
I believe him. Maybe somebody
put him in there.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.529
The same way somebody
"put" you into the
force-field bubble?

08:56.619 --> 08:58.120
FARGO: Okay, fair point.
CARTER: Uh-huh.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.320
But we're not
talking about me.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.955
Fargos may be cursed,
but we're honest.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.458
Will you please just
look into it?

09:05.503 --> 09:07.835
|'|| personally put
someone on that right away.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.840
(TAPPING)

09:11.092 --> 09:14.880
I'm sorry, is my working
disturbing your reading?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.844
No.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.263
So, does Allison know?

09:22.353 --> 09:23.388
About?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.721
The woman
you're sending flowers to.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.182
It's none of
Allison's business,
nor do I think she would care.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.349
Hmm.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.394
Did something happen
with you two?

09:32.489 --> 09:33.854
Can we talk about
something else?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.022
Yeah, like what?

09:35.116 --> 09:38.233
Like, what pumps are gonna
be in fashion this fall?

09:38.328 --> 09:41.991
I'm just asking 'cause
I want to know what
belts to buy.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.163
Funny.

09:46.669 --> 09:50.287
Wow. Pierre was working
with Andre Sandrov.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.209
CARTER: Who is...

09:52.258 --> 09:54.715
Who is Eureka's
Albert Einstein.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.714
I would have thought
Albert Einstein

09:56.805 --> 09:58.716
would have been Eureka's
Albert Einstein.

09:58.807 --> 10:02.720
Yeah, but, point is Sandrov's
revered here, by everyone.

10:03.269 --> 10:07.808
And he gave a statement
that Pierre went AWOL in 1957,

10:07.899 --> 10:10.311
after giving written notice
at work.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.187
Which Pierre didn't mention.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.356
(BEEPING)

10:14.405 --> 10:17.238
Cold War is over.
The Soviet Union is gone.

10:17.283 --> 10:18.819
The Red Sox won
the World Series.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.525
I don't really understand
why that one's important,

10:20.578 --> 10:21.863
but everybody
keeps on telling me it is.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.904
I guess I just
don't really get baseball.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.447
Grandpa, are you listening?

10:25.542 --> 10:26.907
Hey, look,

10:28.419 --> 10:31.411
I'm having a hard enough time
processing all of this, okay?

10:31.464 --> 10:33.671
And |... You seem
like a really nice guy,

10:33.758 --> 10:35.339
and I admit that there's
a slight resemblance,

10:35.426 --> 10:37.917
but, you know,
this is insane.

10:37.971 --> 10:41.463
I'm Pierre Fargo.
I'm nobody's grandpa. Okay?

10:41.558 --> 10:42.923
I'm not even a father.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.509
I'm pretty sure you were.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.936
Look, we're practically
the same age.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.097
Well, yeah, pretty much.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.650
Okay, great, so in light
of that, let's just
drop "Grandpa."

10:54.737 --> 10:59.356
Let's stick with
"Dr. Fargo," okay?
Nice meeting you.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.236
Hey. Wait!

11:02.162 --> 11:04.323
Wait! Wait!

11:04.414 --> 11:06.530
(PANTING) Belle St. John
is my grandmother.

11:07.292 --> 11:09.658
So Belle is still alive?
Very much so.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.872
Well, that's wonderful news.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.124
I have to see her. How do you
get out of this place?

11:14.215 --> 11:16.251
Not by going that way.
Anyway, you can't see her.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.882
She's in Alaska, which,
by the way, is a state now.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.880
It's very big with tourists.
Hmm. What's she doing there?

11:19.971 --> 11:20.960
No, not that way.

11:21.055 --> 11:24.013
She's dogsledding.
She'll be back on the weekend.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.340
My Belle always had
a wild side.

11:25.435 --> 11:29.474
She also had a son.
My dad, Thomas.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.806
He died in a lab accident
when I was a little kid.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.562
Pushed the wrong button.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.517
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:37.238 --> 11:40.776
So I suppose she must have
gotten married then,
if she had a son.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.283
No, she always said she was
holding out for her dream man.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.989
Really?

11:46.039 --> 11:47.074
(CHUCKLING)

11:47.165 --> 11:48.871
I brought a picture of her.

11:48.958 --> 11:52.371
Might look a little bit
different than she did
when she was 20.

11:54.672 --> 11:59.507
Oh, she's still beautiful.

12:00.678 --> 12:05.843
I've missed so much,
but I'm not missing any more.

12:07.185 --> 12:12.305
JO: 1957, brand-new
Ford Thunderbird
costs 3,000 bucks?

12:12.357 --> 12:15.190
Speaking of cars,
I'd like to start
driving mine.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.896
Not till you dry out.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.355
I haven't had caffeine
all day.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.526
I said a week.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.561
A week.

12:22.033 --> 12:24.149
Okay, you want
to play hardball?

12:25.370 --> 12:26.951
Who's Angela Fairfield?

12:29.415 --> 12:31.201
You hit redial
on my cell phone, didn't you?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.367
Cop's daughter,
you pick things up.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.126
Well, normally
I'd be proud,

12:36.214 --> 12:38.000
but, Zoe, don't go
digging into this.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.210
Well, if you would
just tell me who she is,
I wouldn't have to.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.416
Someone from my past.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.092
Okay, then why are you...
Zoe.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.760
Why are you sending her
flowers today?

12:44.847 --> 12:46.223
We're not discussing this.

12:46.307 --> 12:51.097
I think | just found out
why Pierre would want
to put himself on ice.

12:51.187 --> 12:57.183
Birth certificate for
a Thomas Steven Fargo,
son of Belle St. John.

12:59.153 --> 13:02.520
Hmm. Born eight months after
Pierre Fargo disappeared.

13:02.573 --> 13:04.404
Maybe he found out
about the pregnancy,

13:04.492 --> 13:07.575
panicked, and took
a cryo-trip to the future.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.906
I don't know, that seems
a little extreme.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.742
Oh, it says here,
"Fatherhood can scare men

13:11.833 --> 13:15.075
"into disassociation,
which can lower
their sex drive."

13:15.128 --> 13:17.710
You, burn this.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.086
Where are you going?

13:19.173 --> 13:22.131
Talk to Pierre. See if he
had some fatherhood issues.

13:22.510 --> 13:23.841
I know I do.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.011
PIERRE: This place is a maze.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.259
Just last week the frame
for this building was
going Up,

13:29.309 --> 13:30.845
and now look at it.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.767
(CHUCKLING) Say, did we ever
get to the moon?

13:33.855 --> 13:35.095
Yeah, in '62.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.599
Way to go, guys!

13:36.691 --> 13:39.854
Top secret, of course.
We didn't go public until '69.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.734
What's that?
It's a computer.

13:45.783 --> 13:47.398
Oh, so is this.

13:48.911 --> 13:50.071
It's so small.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.406
Microchips.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.913
That PDA,
a personal digital assistant,

13:53.958 --> 13:56.119
can store the entire
Library of Congress

13:56.210 --> 13:57.916
and track
a satellite in orbit.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.044
(LAUGHING) Terrific.

14:01.716 --> 14:03.001
PIERRE: Dear Lord.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.798
FARGO: Ah, the robotics lab.

14:07.305 --> 14:10.297
If you think
that's impressive,
you should see the big one.

14:16.230 --> 14:18.266
Holy smokes!

14:21.861 --> 14:23.726
Tissue rejuvenation
research.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.152
Yeah, it's not really
my cup of tea,

14:25.239 --> 14:26.399
but there's some
computer stuff over...

14:26.491 --> 14:28.322
Hey, hold on a second.

14:29.160 --> 14:34.245
That's my cellular
reconstruction technique.
They're using my methodology.

14:35.958 --> 14:39.371
No, that process is based on
the research of Andre Sandrov.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.702
Sandrov?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.500
No, he...

14:43.925 --> 14:45.256
He was a lab tech.

14:45.343 --> 14:47.959
(CHUCKLING) Sandrov
was the forefather

14:48.012 --> 14:50.594
of modern bioengineering
and cryogenics.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.058
He's a Global Dynamics
treasure. See?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.308
No, this can't be.
I'm the treasure.

14:59.357 --> 15:01.973
No, no, trust me.
Nobody treasures Fargos.

15:02.026 --> 15:06.110
They treasure people who win
Nobel Prizes, like Sandrov.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.689
Sandrov won the Nobel?
What for?

15:09.742 --> 15:11.824
The dedifferentiation
of mesenchymal cells.

15:11.869 --> 15:14.531
No! That was my idea!

15:14.580 --> 15:16.320
That idea got him
a statue in the park

15:16.374 --> 15:19.411
and a multimillion-dollar
foundation named after him.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.539
I can't believe this.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.081
Sandrov stole my research.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.713
He stole my life.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.304
Sandrov wasn't a genius.
He was a thief.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.635
A thief?
Yeah.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.436
A thief who's given millions
of dollars back to this town?

15:41.524 --> 15:44.812
Yes, millions of my dollars,
based on my ideas.

15:44.902 --> 15:46.984
Now, he shoved me
into that chamber,

15:47.071 --> 15:49.278
a cryochamber
which I designed, by the way.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.105
How do you like that
for irony?

15:51.200 --> 15:54.442
Just so he could steal my work
and pass it off as his own.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.368
We found Sandrov's
police statement.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.780
In that statement, he said
that you left a letter
of resignation

15:58.875 --> 16:00.536
before you disappeared.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.246
Now, why would I resign?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.253
I was on the verge
of greatness,

16:05.298 --> 16:07.459
which he has now
taken from me.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.257
He is a liar.
Work was great.

16:10.344 --> 16:12.255
Belle was...
Pregnant.

16:14.557 --> 16:16.093
Belle was pregnant.

16:16.184 --> 16:17.344
Now, careful, slim.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.426
I respect that
you're an officer of the law,

16:19.520 --> 16:21.260
but you're insulting
the good name of my girl,

16:21.355 --> 16:22.811
and I will not stand for it.
Okay.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.390
Come on.
Okay, nobody's
insulting anybody.

16:30.781 --> 16:35.696
Belle St. John gave birth
to Thomas Steven Fargo
eight months after you left.

16:39.290 --> 16:42.578
Fatherhood is a big
responsibility,

16:42.627 --> 16:45.414
and you wouldn't be
the first guy to run from it.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.078
Run from it?

16:47.965 --> 16:50.297
I was going to propose
to Belle. I...

16:52.303 --> 16:53.793
Here, look.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.638
I was on my way to pick up
the ring before our dinner.

16:57.683 --> 17:01.676
Believe me, fatherhood
is the last thing that
I would run from.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.649
I'm not sure
how I'm supposed to feel.

17:05.733 --> 17:06.813
(CHUCKLING
AWKWARDLY)

17:06.859 --> 17:09.441
I just lost a son
that I never knew I had.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.656
You still have me.

17:13.824 --> 17:16.236
Not sure how I'm supposed
to feel about that, either.

17:16.327 --> 17:19.160
Andre Sandrov
took away my family

17:19.247 --> 17:22.080
and ruined my good name,
and now he has to pay.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.157
And I will set
the record straight.

17:24.210 --> 17:28.078
You honestly believe
that Andre Sandrov
stole Pierre Fargo's research?

17:28.172 --> 17:30.458
Well, I don't know,
which is why I'm
gonna ask him.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.920
All the ridiculous claims,
and by a Fargo.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.341
Oh, so you're saying
it's not even possible?

17:34.387 --> 17:36.343
Well, no...
Well, yes.

17:36.389 --> 17:39.005
Scientists are always
bickering over credit
for breakthroughs.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.636
Or denying responsibility
for them.

17:40.685 --> 17:41.765
Are you still on that?
Yes!

17:41.852 --> 17:43.433
Oh, can we please
stay focused on this?

17:43.521 --> 17:47.355
Look, Sandrov was a visionary.
His work is well documented.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.436
Read any of his
voluminous biographies,
or get a book on tape.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.521
You know what? Just do
the tox screen on
Pierre's blood.

17:54.574 --> 17:55.814
I'm gonna go talk
to your visionary.

17:55.866 --> 17:58.198
Carter, please, I need you
to keep in mind

17:58.244 --> 18:01.361
that the Sandrov Foundation
is funding our stem-cell
research.

18:01.414 --> 18:04.747
So, you want me to go easy
on him because he gives
you money?

18:04.834 --> 18:07.450
No, but he is a very
well-respected man

18:07.545 --> 18:09.752
with a lot of friends
at the DOD.

18:09.839 --> 18:12.501
So for your own sake,
tread lightly.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.667
I believe that when someone
is responsible for something,

18:15.720 --> 18:18.553
that they should be held
accountable.

18:18.639 --> 18:19.719
Okay?

18:28.733 --> 18:30.439
If you could wait
on the lower chairs,

18:30.526 --> 18:33.108
Dr. Sandrov will join you
momentarily.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.321
Thank you.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.821
Nice place.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.074
This is what
a Nobel Prize buys you? Huh.

18:42.705 --> 18:46.197
So, where did you
and Angela Fairfield meet?

18:47.752 --> 18:49.162
Let it go.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.789
Can I help you?

18:51.881 --> 18:56.921
Oh, hey, Dr. Sandrov.
I'm Sheriff Jack Carter.
This is my deputy, Jo Lupo.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.630
Is there something wrong?

18:58.721 --> 19:00.712
Oh, depends on
how you look at it.

19:00.806 --> 19:05.220
I'm not sure if you've heard.
Global Dynamics revived
someone from cryostasis today.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.384
Really?

19:06.437 --> 19:09.270
He's apparently been in there
for about 50 years.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.188
Well, that is tremendous.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.355
Ha!

19:12.443 --> 19:14.354
I knew that design
would prove itself out.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.403
| just didn't know if it would
be within my lifetime.

19:17.448 --> 19:19.689
The man they woke up
is Pierre Fargo.

19:20.451 --> 19:24.569
He claims that
you stole his research,
including the cryochamber.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.953
Do you remember him?

19:26.040 --> 19:28.747
Yes, of course.
He used to work for me,

19:28.793 --> 19:32.206
but how in the world
did he end up in cryostasis?

19:32.296 --> 19:33.627
That's what we're trying
to figure out.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.585
Pierre seemed to make it sound
like you worked for him.

19:36.634 --> 19:37.794
Well, I'm not surprised.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.752
Pierre's reach
often exceeded his grasp.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.638
He tried to pass off my work
as his own.

19:47.311 --> 19:51.304
Then he disappeared.
A shame, really.
He's quite talented.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.814
Some people just seem
destined for failure.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.022
Sir, is there any truth
to Pierre Fargo's claims?

19:58.489 --> 20:02.323
I'd like to think the body
of my work speaks for itself.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.196
But I look forward
to hearing how he recovers.

20:04.286 --> 20:05.537
Do wish him well for me.

20:05.621 --> 20:06.827
Thank you.

20:06.914 --> 20:10.452
Now, I'm hosting a cocktail
fundraiser this evening

20:10.501 --> 20:12.992
that I need to prepare for,
so...

20:13.045 --> 20:14.285
Unless there was
anything else?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.670
No, not at the moment.
Thank you very much
for your time.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.081
Not at all.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.802
Charming guy.

20:24.306 --> 20:26.683
If this breakthrough
was based on Sandrov's work,

20:26.767 --> 20:28.303
he should have been dying
to see the result.

20:28.352 --> 20:31.810
Oh, and he was, until
he found out it was Pierre.

20:31.856 --> 20:33.141
Yeah.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.270
So, what now?

20:34.358 --> 20:36.019
Well, I think Sandrov's
a smart guy.

20:36.068 --> 20:39.105
We take his suggestion,
go check out his body of work.

20:43.117 --> 20:49.033
This town is amazing.
The transformation
is just incredible.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.039
All along here
were Quonset huts,

20:52.084 --> 20:54.325
and a dirt road,
if you can believe it.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.209
I mean, there were
only 100 of us.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.037
It was more a military base
than a town.

20:58.132 --> 21:01.295
Yeah, they didn't really bring
in the city planners and
architects until the '60s.

21:01.385 --> 21:02.670
(BEEPING)

21:02.887 --> 21:06.630
No, no, it's okay.
It's just a car alarm.
It's anti-theft.

21:06.724 --> 21:07.930
Oh.

21:08.017 --> 21:11.680
Well, we used to leave
our keys in the ignition.
I guess times have changed.

21:11.729 --> 21:15.096
Hmm. Well, it's really nice
having you back, Grandpa.

21:17.067 --> 21:20.150
| tell you what,
you can call me Pierre.

21:20.237 --> 21:23.229
Oh, sorry. I'm just excited.
I've never really had
a grandfather,

21:23.324 --> 21:26.236
or a father, or friends.

21:27.578 --> 21:31.287
Well, I guess if you don't use
it in public, it's okay.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.625
Deal. So, where
are we going?

21:33.709 --> 21:35.574
To see an old friend.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.164
We have the results
of Pierre's tox screen.

21:38.255 --> 21:42.624
So, is our boy a deadbeat dad,
or did somebody
throw him in the freezer?

21:42.843 --> 21:45.425
Well, there are traces
of chloroform in his system.

21:46.180 --> 21:47.386
Traces?

21:48.265 --> 21:50.881
Fine, there's enough there
to sink him like a rock.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.472
So Pierre was telling
the truth. Somebody was
out to get him.

21:53.562 --> 21:56.395
Well, if you're looking
for more praise from me...

21:56.440 --> 21:58.772
What I'm looking at
is the praise for
Andre Sandrov,

21:58.818 --> 22:00.433
and wondering
if it's deserved.

22:00.528 --> 22:04.066
Deserved? Sandrov was
one of the greatest
thinkers of his time,

22:04.406 --> 22:05.532
any time.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.447
Yeah, but he was
just a mid-level researcher,

22:07.493 --> 22:09.905
until his big breakthrough
in cell regeneration.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.569
So?
So, that didn't happen
until a month

22:11.622 --> 22:13.954
after Pierre disappeared.

22:24.635 --> 22:26.591
Charlie, you old dog.

22:29.682 --> 22:30.967
Pierre?

22:31.058 --> 22:32.047
In the flesh.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.098
You haven't aged a day.
Where've you been?

22:34.144 --> 22:36.396
Well, you remember
my little cryostasis project?

22:36.480 --> 22:39.972
Uh-huh.
Let's just say it worked,
and here I am.

22:40.025 --> 22:42.311
I have something
for you.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.817
How about that?
That's from 1957.

22:47.950 --> 22:49.986
Looks just like new,
doesn't it?

22:50.077 --> 22:53.490
So, do you still have
that diamond you were
growing for Belle's ring?

22:53.539 --> 22:59.125
Oh, I'm sorry, Pierre.
I sold it a couple of
years after you left,

22:59.169 --> 23:01.455
or we thought you'd left.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.497
Oh. Well,
it was a long shot.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.666
I was hoping I could
still give it to her.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.675
I don't know.
You might want
to think about that.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.679
I mean, lots happened
since you disappeared.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.723
And people really believed
that I would just leave her
like that?

23:14.810 --> 23:15.845
Even you?

23:15.936 --> 23:18.973
I came by with the diamond,
and you'd gone.

23:19.607 --> 23:24.101
So Belle has lived
this entire time believing
that I ran off on her.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.895
She did fine, Pierre.
I mean, she's a strong one.

23:28.365 --> 23:33.029
But seeing her now
might not go the way
you planned.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.324
Okay.

23:36.373 --> 23:39.160
I'll keep that in mind.
Thanks, Charlie.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.454
Take care.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.664
Let's go.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.341
Go where?

23:49.386 --> 23:51.547
To clear my name.
We have to find that letter.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.470
We?
Of course.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.548
Well, it's your name, too.

23:55.935 --> 23:56.924
Let's go.

23:58.854 --> 24:00.685
ZOE: SARAH, I need to look up
a name.

24:00.731 --> 24:02.096
SARAH: Of course. Who?

24:02.191 --> 24:04.603
Dad's new girlfriend,
Angela Fairfield.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.901
I don 't feel comfortable
prying into the Sheriff's
personal life.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.780
Oh, no, no, no, I'm not
prying. Ijust want to know

24:10.866 --> 24:13.778
who she is, and where
she lives, and what
she looks like.

24:13.869 --> 24:16.030
Sorry. Out of the question.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.240
Okay. Fair.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.955
But, you know,
it would be a shame

24:21.043 --> 24:23.955
for everyone to find out
about your addiction
to Jerry Springer.

24:24.254 --> 24:25.243
Hmm.

24:25.422 --> 24:27.583
I have no idea who that is.

24:28.258 --> 24:30.249
(CROWD SCREAM/N6)

24:35.766 --> 24:37.973
Yeah, you're not
fooling anyone.
Fine.

24:38.143 --> 24:40.850
There ’s no Ange/a Fairﬁeld
living in Eureka.

24:41.438 --> 24:43.429
Okay, can you try
widening the search?

24:43.524 --> 24:44.639
None in Oregon.

24:44.733 --> 24:47.224
Okay, try other places
my dad has lived.

24:47.277 --> 24:51.065
For the last 25 years,
there have been four
in Laguna Beach.

24:51.115 --> 24:53.822
Show me their pictures.
I know his type.

24:54.410 --> 24:57.322
Okay, the one
with the big hair, who is she?

24:57.413 --> 25:00.280
There 's a juvenile
police record associated
with her name,

25:00.374 --> 25:01.784
but it's closed.

25:01.834 --> 25:04.246
A record? A record for who?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.454
Your father.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.134
Wow. It could take forever
to find my letter
in all these files.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.470
FARGO: Restricted files.
We shouldn't even be in here.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.309
We better hurry.
I've changed my mind.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.685
I don't think I can do this.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.107
Well, you have to.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.519
And so what if we get caught?
What's the worst
that could happen?

25:31.613 --> 25:33.820
I'd lose myjob,
and you'd go to jail?

25:33.907 --> 25:36.319
I've seen the way people
treat you around here,

25:36.368 --> 25:38.654
and getting fired
could be a blessing.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.406
True.

25:40.497 --> 25:41.782
Come on.

25:43.459 --> 25:44.995
Let's get at it.

25:50.799 --> 25:52.505
It is amazing!
Oh, I found it.

25:52.551 --> 25:55.588
Super. Now, let's get that
letter and get out of here.

25:56.722 --> 25:57.711
Ah-ha.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.018
Okay, yes.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.390
There we go.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.848
Hey, here it is,
August 30, 1957.

26:08.942 --> 26:10.603
"For personal reasons beyond
my control,

26:10.694 --> 26:13.731
"I hereby tender
my resignation,
effective immediately.

26:13.822 --> 26:16.029
"Sincerely, Pierre Fargo."

26:16.075 --> 26:17.360
Is that your signature?

26:17.451 --> 26:19.783
Well, yes,
but I never wrote this.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.320
What the hell
are you two doing?

26:22.372 --> 26:24.749
You set alarms off
all over the building.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.918
Don't punish him.
This was my idea.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.745
And that would be
what exactly?

26:31.840 --> 26:35.503
Sandrov set me up,
and I needed this resignation
letter to prove it.

26:37.346 --> 26:39.052
Okay, can I see it?

26:42.518 --> 26:44.008
I know this looks bad.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.723
Well, it's about
to look a lot worse.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.273
(SIGHING)

26:51.777 --> 26:56.020
It is astonishing his tissue
could have survived

without any signs
of degeneration.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.689
(CHUCKLING)

27:00.244 --> 27:03.111
It's good to see you
getting back to real science.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.240
Feels good.

27:07.334 --> 27:09.245
Nothing like
exploring the unknown.

27:09.294 --> 27:10.670
Nothing like it.

27:11.421 --> 27:16.085
Henry, the other day
you said that
you knew for sure

27:16.176 --> 27:18.417
that the accident with
the artifact was not my fault.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.633
How do you know?
I found something
in Kim's lab.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.930
Her computers were sabotaged.

27:24.393 --> 27:25.382
By whom?

27:25.811 --> 27:27.847
I don't know,
but clearly you and Kim

27:27.938 --> 27:30.771
were on the verge
of understanding
something

27:30.816 --> 27:33.307
that someone
was trying to protect.

27:33.944 --> 27:36.230
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

27:38.907 --> 27:43.241

anything like that?

27:43.287 --> 27:44.447
Never.

27:47.833 --> 27:51.200
CARTER: The bad news is that
they have you on a
class-three security breach.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.753
The good news is that
the mattress is
surprisingly supportive.

27:55.215 --> 27:57.126
If he's staying,
I'm staying with him.

27:57.217 --> 27:59.299
That's fine with me.
I have to go to the bathroom.

There's one just in there.

28:03.140 --> 28:05.381
Can't he just use
your bathroom, Sheriff?

That window
doesn't even open.

28:11.398 --> 28:12.433
Swell.

28:12.566 --> 28:15.057
Mr. Fairfield, excuse me
for a second.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.642
I need to take this,
all right?

28:16.695 --> 28:19.812
I'm watching!
I mean, I'm not watching,
but I'm watching.

28:22.743 --> 28:24.358
Sorry about that.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.323
(STUTTERING)
No, no, no need to thank...

28:29.082 --> 28:30.288
I know.

28:32.586 --> 28:33.917
Yeah, me, too.

28:34.171 --> 28:36.002
ZOE: So, what have you got
on Ange/a Fairﬁeld?

28:36.089 --> 28:38.466
SARAH: I found some
photo documentation.

28:38.842 --> 28:40.457
What are these from?

28:40.510 --> 28:42.421
Angela's high-school
yearbook.

28:43.222 --> 28:44.962
Wait, wait, stop there.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.846
No way! That's Dad.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.141
There 's another one
of them together.

28:49.811 --> 28:52.678
So, she was
his high school sweetheart.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.892
Why is he still
sending her flowers?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.855
Wait, wait.
Hold it there.

29:00.614 --> 29:03.651
Oh, my God.
She died.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.203
I'm sorry about that.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.369

since you left.

this is Sheriff Carter!

PIERRE: Go away, Sheriff.
There's nothing
you can do for me now.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.749
What sort of trouble
you having?

29:21.843 --> 29:24.050
Not the kind
you'd understand, Sheriff.

I could kick
the door down.

Look, Pierre,
I know this has to be a shock.
Things must look pretty bleak.

29:37.276 --> 29:41.770
You're scared.
We've all been there,
not exactly there.

29:41.863 --> 29:45.481
But my point is
you don't have to go
through this alone.

29:46.702 --> 29:48.408
You have family out here.

29:53.250 --> 29:54.615

30:04.928 --> 30:07.419
It's happening too fast.

halted the aging process,
but as soon as he got out...

30:21.278 --> 30:23.439
It's making up
for the lost time.
Exactly.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.395
The problem is
that the accelerated aging

30:25.449 --> 30:27.360
is causing advanced
cell degeneration.

30:27.451 --> 30:29.658
There is no indication that
that is slowing down.

30:29.745 --> 30:31.610
But I just got him back.
Now I'm gonna lose him?

30:31.705 --> 30:34.538
Fargo, we are doing
everything we can.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.956
It's uncharted territory.
Of course, it is.

30:37.044 --> 30:39.831
Fargo...
No, he's notjust
some screw-up.

30:39.921 --> 30:41.912
He had his whole life
stolen from him,

30:41.965 --> 30:44.627
his work, his reputation,
his family.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.342
He doesn't deserve
this, so...

30:49.598 --> 30:52.465
Don't treat him
like just another lab rat.

30:54.144 --> 30:56.305
I'm gonna go see my grandpa.

from bedpans and sponge baths.

being here, Charlie.

Just wanted to see you
with a few wrinkles.

Hey, listen.
|f| go without seeing Belle,

31:26.551 --> 31:28.257
would you do me a favor,

31:28.345 --> 31:30.677
and tell her that
I came back to her,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.883
and that I never stopped
loving her?

31:32.974 --> 31:34.134
You'll tell her yourself.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.175
Would you do that
for me, pal?

31:36.853 --> 31:38.013
IWill.

31:38.105 --> 31:39.436
Thank you.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.891
Hey, Charlie, Pierre, Fargo.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.362
Well, thanks
for the books, Sheriff,

31:46.405 --> 31:48.862

a lot of leisure time left.

Yeah...

Kind of busy trying to save
Fargo's granddad.
What do you need?

31:52.369 --> 31:55.827
Yeah, I checked out a bunch
of biographies of Sandrov's

31:55.872 --> 31:57.988
that talk all about his
groundbreaking research.

31:58.041 --> 32:00.123
Generally what
biographies do, yes.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.199
Yeah, but these
were all written

32:01.294 --> 32:03.876
about breakthroughs
that happened after
Pierre disappeared.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.911
(SIGHING)

32:05.006 --> 32:06.462
So, let's see what he knows.

32:06.550 --> 32:07.756
Carter, you're wasting time.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.674
I don't have
a lot of time left.

32:09.719 --> 32:12.256
All I have is my name
and my legacy.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.924
And I'd like a chance
to set the record
straight before I go.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.634
Exactly, and since
you're the big Sandrov expert

32:19.729 --> 32:21.890
and you have access to all the
classified information,

32:21.982 --> 32:23.643
I think it should be you
who asks him the questions

32:23.733 --> 32:25.348
that only the real talent
would know.

32:25.402 --> 32:26.391
Fine.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.401
(SIGHING)

32:28.447 --> 32:31.234
What did you first use
to encourage cell
regeneration?

32:31.283 --> 32:36.949
Well, you need raw materials,
so we started with hypatocyte
and osteoblast stimulants.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.576
Were you successful?

32:40.667 --> 32:42.532
(LAUGHING) Not exactly.

32:43.336 --> 32:46.669
The first successful cell
regeneration occurred

32:46.756 --> 32:49.498
on my 482nd try.

32:53.305 --> 32:56.092
I take it from your silence
that's another right answer.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.593
When were you first
able to isolate

32:57.684 --> 33:00.847
and identify signals
responsible for cell growth?

33:00.937 --> 33:05.101
Actually, I wasn't.
It was my hypothesis
that the expression

33:05.150 --> 33:08.392
of small molecules
known as micro-RNAs

33:08.445 --> 33:14.190
act as molecular regulators,
and thereby control
the growth of isolates,

33:14.951 --> 33:16.657
but it was a long shot.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.404
A theory that proved
to be true,

33:21.458 --> 33:23.449
five years
after Pierre disappeared.

33:23.543 --> 33:24.874
So he's right?

33:25.962 --> 33:27.293
(CHUCKLING)

33:27.547 --> 33:31.961
Pierre, your research
changed our understanding
of the human cell.

It was Pierre's work
all along.

33:37.891 --> 33:40.223
Anybody want to crash a party?

33:40.810 --> 33:41.890
Me.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.970
I've just finished
lecturing in Vienna,

33:45.023 --> 33:48.356
so I could return to view
the galleys for my new book
in October.

33:48.443 --> 33:51.025
And what would the title
of that book be, Andre,

into the parlor?

33:58.411 --> 34:01.369
No, thank you.
You've kept me
hidden long enough.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.821
I don't know
what you're talking about.

34:02.916 --> 34:04.326
You be careful.

34:05.043 --> 34:09.457
I'm a dying man
with nothing left to lose,
and it's all because of you.

34:09.506 --> 34:13.749
Dr. Sandrov, you had plenty
of opportunity and everything
to gain.

34:14.135 --> 34:17.172
You think
I put him in the cryochamber?

34:18.682 --> 34:21.389
No. I have gains of my own.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.512
This town wouldn't be here
without me.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.302
Tell them, Dr. Stark.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.016
| wish I could.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.431
We already know that your
breakthroughs were based
upon Pierre's work

34:29.526 --> 34:31.141
which you passed off
as your own.

34:31.194 --> 34:34.186
It was unethical.
It was illegal.

34:34.489 --> 34:37.731
But attempted murder
is a different matter
altogether.

34:37.826 --> 34:40.659
I attempted
nothing of the kind.

34:42.372 --> 34:45.956
I came into the lab
that night, and you
weren't there.

34:46.042 --> 34:50.411
Your letter of resignation
was on the table,
and that was it.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.963
I never wrote that letter,
and | find it hard to believe
that you didn't notice

34:54.050 --> 34:55.881
that there was someone
in one of the chambers.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.715
Nobody noticed.
We were all caught up
in our own deadlines.

34:59.764 --> 35:03.052
I was failing
to meet mine,

35:03.101 --> 35:08.312
so when you didn't come back,
your work was there,
and it was brilliant.

35:08.315 --> 35:09.725
so when you didn't come back,
your work was there,
and it was brilliant.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.396
Ijust picked up
where you left off.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.070
A sin of omission.

35:17.157 --> 35:19.489
If you didn't put my grandpa
in there, who did?

35:19.576 --> 35:21.032
I don't know.

35:22.412 --> 35:24.152
I am sorry, Pierre.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.411
So, what do we do now?

35:28.543 --> 35:34.755
The only thing we can do.
A great scientist is dying
of rapid tissue degeneration,

35:34.799 --> 35:37.211
and you're gonna help me
save him.

35:44.601 --> 35:46.432
So, you really think
this will work?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.594
The treatment is based
on your theory, Pierre.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.104
I simply augmented
and refined it.

35:51.733 --> 35:55.021
Unfortunately, it's not gonna
make you any younger.

35:59.407 --> 36:00.567
Grandpa...

36:00.617 --> 36:02.778
Okay, let me have it.

36:05.747 --> 36:07.112
(GROANING)

36:08.166 --> 36:10.248
Okay.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.958
(SIGHING)

36:13.797 --> 36:15.162
Oh, yeah.

36:15.340 --> 36:16.546
Yeah, okay.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.383
Well, those years
are gone, anyhow.

36:20.804 --> 36:23.261
| just want to make the most
of the time I have left.

36:23.306 --> 36:25.968
And we'll all make sure
you get credit where
credit is due.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.632
Won't we, Dr. Sandrov?

36:27.727 --> 36:29.137
Of course.

36:29.229 --> 36:31.641
And I'm still working
on figuring out who
put you in that chamber.

36:31.731 --> 36:33.562
Well, it's your worry
now, Chief.

36:33.650 --> 36:37.734
The truth's come out,
and Ijust want to put
things right with Belle.

36:41.032 --> 36:44.320
| wish I'd still had this ring
that I was going to give her.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.320
Could I see that order slip
for a second?

36:51.209 --> 36:52.574
Thanks.

36:58.508 --> 37:03.252
The signature on this
resignation letter
is traced

37:04.013 --> 37:05.753
from your order slip.

37:14.357 --> 37:16.689
Hey, Charlie.
Hey, Sheriff.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.726
I heard what happened.
You made it.

37:19.946 --> 37:23.313
That's twice you've risen
from the dead in one week.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.028
Why'd you put him
in the chamber, Charlie?

37:30.039 --> 37:33.031
I knew, as soon
as I saw you in my shop,

37:34.210 --> 37:35.871
my sins had come back
to haunt me.

37:35.962 --> 37:39.830
You looked me in the eye,
and you called me your friend.

37:41.718 --> 37:42.878
I'm so sorry.

37:42.969 --> 37:45.210
Why, Charlie? Why?

37:45.305 --> 37:48.342
You were gonna propose
to Belle, and I've always
loved her.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.722
You never said a word.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.975
When I showed up
to deliver the ring,

37:52.061 --> 37:53.801
well, Ijust couldn't
let her go.

37:53.897 --> 37:55.637
I thought if you were gone,
Belle would think

37:55.732 --> 37:58.394
you'd run out on her,
and I could be her savior.

37:58.485 --> 38:01.602
Well, like you say, the past
always catches up with you.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.854
We're gonna have to
take you in.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.234
Hold on a sec.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.910
Putting Charlie in prison
isn't gonna give me
my life back.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.741
He was in love with Belle.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.160
I understand how that feels.

38:15.251 --> 38:18.118
"Turn the other cheek"
doesn't really apply here.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.670
He has to live alone
with what he's done.

38:21.174 --> 38:23.460
I think
that's punishment enough.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.257
And that's not for you
to decide.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.427
Carter...
Sheriff's right.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.187
For what it's worth,

38:36.481 --> 38:38.563
she never got over you.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.276
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

38:56.459 --> 38:57.574
Hey, Dad.

38:57.627 --> 39:00.460
Hey. Let me guess,
you need a lift home.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.583
Yeah, but that's...

39:04.133 --> 39:06.169
That's actually
not why I came.

39:07.136 --> 39:12.722
I wanted to apologize
for nagging you about Angela.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.643
It's all right.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.311
I found your yearbook,

39:20.608 --> 39:23.941
and I know that she died.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.147
Yeah.

39:25.613 --> 39:26.648
Yeah, she did.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.983
What happened?

39:34.831 --> 39:40.246
I was 17,
and I made a very,
very big mistake.

39:42.171 --> 39:45.709
She was
a great girl.

39:45.800 --> 39:49.463
She was fearless,

39:52.599 --> 39:54.089
reckless,

39:55.977 --> 39:57.763
a little like you

39:57.854 --> 39:59.185
actually.

40:01.691 --> 40:04.524
It was her 16th birthday.

40:05.778 --> 40:08.235
She wanted me to teach her
how to drive.

40:08.948 --> 40:13.658
She was doing great,
and we were celebrating.

40:15.538 --> 40:20.373
We drifted
into the next lane,

40:24.380 --> 40:28.999
and swerved to
get around a car.

40:29.636 --> 40:31.126
I'm so sorry, Dad.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.595
And when the police arrived,
I was holding her.

40:34.933 --> 40:39.051
They assumed
I was driving,

40:40.229 --> 40:42.845
and I was charged
with reckless endangerment.

40:42.899 --> 40:45.060
Why didn't you just tell them
what happened?

40:45.109 --> 40:47.646
It was my responsibility.
It doesn't matter.

40:48.905 --> 40:54.320
So, every year,
I send flowers

40:54.911 --> 40:56.526
to the cemetery.

40:57.872 --> 41:02.411
And every year,
her father calls to thank me.

41:08.049 --> 41:12.258
I haven't talked about this
in a long, long time.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.710
(SNIFFLING)

41:13.763 --> 41:17.927
Well, thank you
for telling me.

41:28.778 --> 41:31.565
(SIGHING) I hope
I don't disappoint her.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.115
Oh, you won't.

41:35.451 --> 41:37.282
A lot has happened.

41:37.370 --> 41:39.110
(BOTH LAUGHING)

41:39.455 --> 41:43.448
I don't exactly know
what I'm going to say.

41:44.043 --> 41:45.783
I think when you...

41:45.920 --> 41:48.161
I think when you see her,
you'll know.

41:56.889 --> 41:58.174
Belle.

41:58.933 --> 42:00.924
Oh, Pierre.

42:01.602 --> 42:03.183
You look so beautiful.

42:03.271 --> 42:05.102
After all these years...

42:06.190 --> 42:08.602
I'm so sorry that I left you
alone, my love.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.482
It's okay.
You're here now.

42:12.321 --> 42:15.984
I've wanted to do this
for a very long time.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.666
Get over yourself, Fargo.

42:27.712 --> 42:31.079
Just because your grandfather
left his mark doesn't mean
you will.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.506
Maybe not,
but it's my name, too.

42:35.470 --> 42:36.835
(SIGHING)
