WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.674
(Birds chirp)

00:06.707 --> 00:08.309
Alexis: Okay,
so I'm thinking like,

00:08.342 --> 00:09.743
season five Carrie Bradshaw,

00:09.777 --> 00:11.712
like, super professional
and polished,

00:11.745 --> 00:13.147
but also like,
chill and flirty

00:13.181 --> 00:15.149
in an impossibly expensive
sort of way.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.251
- You do know that this
is your first day

00:17.285 --> 00:20.321
at Elmdale College,
and not Vogue, right?

00:20.354 --> 00:22.123
- Hush David,

00:22.156 --> 00:24.425
because Jocelyn said that only
her top students go to Elmdale.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.494
- Okay, I think that says more
about Jocelyn as a teacher

00:26.527 --> 00:28.362
than it does her students.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.331
- Kids, it's garbage day.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.266
- Oh good, ours is full.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.335
- Okay, I've told you both
a thousand times,

00:34.368 --> 00:37.105
tie up the bags and leave them
outside your door!

00:37.138 --> 00:39.207
- Okay, but I like,
just put something in it

00:39.240 --> 00:41.109
that made it full, though.

00:41.142 --> 00:44.378
- Yeah, and you're already
wearing your little gloves,
though.

00:44.412 --> 00:46.714
Okay, do me a favour, David,
and don't mention this to dad,

00:46.747 --> 00:48.616
'cause I haven't chosen
my courses yet,

00:48.649 --> 00:50.351
and if he finds out he's
just gonna like, buzz around

00:50.384 --> 00:51.785
until I ask him his opinion.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.787
And no offence to him,
but I don't want it.

00:53.821 --> 00:56.090
- This is the same college
where Malala gave

00:56.124 --> 00:58.192
that devastating commencement
speech, right?

00:58.226 --> 01:00.694
- I don't know, David,
maybe he did.

01:00.728 --> 01:03.097
Anyway, I have a lot
of big changes

01:03.131 --> 01:04.598
happening in my life right now,

01:04.632 --> 01:06.400
so I'd appreciate it if you
were a little bit more onside.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.801
- Okay.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.370
(Door opens and shuts)

01:11.339 --> 01:14.142
- Where'd Alexis go?
- She went for a run,

01:14.175 --> 01:15.609
apparently there are some
really big changes

01:15.643 --> 01:17.145
happening in her life
right now.

01:17.178 --> 01:19.480
- Yeah, I should say so.

01:19.513 --> 01:21.449
- Why are you waving
a thermometer in my face?

01:21.482 --> 01:24.785
- It's a pregnancy test.
- Ewww! What?!

01:27.188 --> 01:31.125
♪♪♪

01:33.327 --> 01:34.795
- Well, it's a smiley face,

01:34.828 --> 01:36.797
so I'm assuming
it's a positive result.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.332
- Well, that's presumptuous.

01:38.366 --> 01:40.868
- Are we a 100% sure it's hers?

01:40.901 --> 01:43.837
- Well, this test
is a 100% sure it's someone's!

01:46.207 --> 01:48.542
- Oh, are you serious?
I was ready to stop after one!

01:48.576 --> 01:50.211
- Come to think of it,

01:50.244 --> 01:52.180
she has been very up
and down lately,

01:52.213 --> 01:53.881
but I've been just chalking
that up to the fact

01:53.914 --> 01:56.417
that her personal life is like
a steaming pile of--

01:56.450 --> 01:59.287
- Someone needs to talk to her!
- Well, don't look at me,

01:59.320 --> 02:01.489
I'm pretty sure she already
knows it's a mistake!

02:01.522 --> 02:03.191
- No, I'll talk to her.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.926
Yes, I'll tell her she has
no right to lay

02:05.959 --> 02:09.697
this financial and
psychological burden on us!

02:09.730 --> 02:12.300
- Well, maybe I'll talk
to her...

02:12.333 --> 02:14.402
- Now she has to move into one
of those homes

02:14.435 --> 02:17.738
for unwed mothers!
- Oh my God, imagine?

02:17.771 --> 02:19.407
- Moira, that's not gonna
happen.

02:19.440 --> 02:20.874
- Oh, I'm sure there
are plenty of them

02:20.908 --> 02:22.576
on this side of the tracks.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.745
Let the nuns take care
of the little stranger!

02:24.778 --> 02:27.915
- What Alexis needs now is to
feel supported by her family!

02:27.948 --> 02:29.583
- Hah!
- Okay.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.420
Um, I'm just gonna say it,
I am not in a place right now

02:32.453 --> 02:34.655
to be emotionally available
to a baby.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.757
- You know I'm a little
disappointed in you, David,

02:36.790 --> 02:38.692
you spend a lot of time
with Alexis,

02:38.726 --> 02:40.861
you could've done a better job
looking out for her!

02:40.894 --> 02:43.697
- Okay, I'm sorry
I'm not a condom.

02:43.731 --> 02:46.534
- Aaaah! I always knew
this would happen!

02:47.935 --> 02:49.703
Oh, God help us all.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.308
- Okay, I just think I'm in
a state of shock right now,

02:54.342 --> 02:56.310
you know, the news
was very numbing,

02:56.344 --> 03:00.481
and I'm feeling very alone.
- Mhmm. Mm!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.416
Imagine how Alexis must feel.

03:02.450 --> 03:03.751
- Yeah, I haven't spoken to her.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.454
- Huh. Remind what this is
again?

03:06.487 --> 03:08.989
- That is a eucalyptus
under eye serum.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.758
- Mhmm...

03:10.791 --> 03:12.726
and remind me why you can't
apply it to yourself?

03:12.760 --> 03:15.529
- Because it requires
a steady hand,

03:15.563 --> 03:17.431
and I'm going through
a lot right now.

03:17.465 --> 03:20.368
- Right...
(Bell on door jingles)

03:20.401 --> 03:22.370
- Hi, I was looking
for some uh--

03:22.403 --> 03:24.238
- Yeah, we don't sell that.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.574
- Bath salts?
- We actually do sell those.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.609
They're on the middle shelf,
just over there.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.244
I'll be over to help you
in a second.

03:30.278 --> 03:32.646
- Okay, between Alexis
getting knocked up,

03:32.680 --> 03:36.016
and us not having enough
privacy to connect,

03:36.049 --> 03:37.951
I'm feeling very shaken.

03:37.985 --> 03:39.687
- Do you think you're gonna
make it, though?

03:39.720 --> 03:41.255
- Unclear.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.690
Unclear on whether I'm gonna
make it through or not.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.392
- Hang in there.

03:47.795 --> 03:51.265
Moira: Jocelyn, oh, I seem to
have left my sunglasses behind,

03:51.299 --> 03:53.567
you haven't discovered them
amidst your cleaning, have you?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.803
- You mean, the ones on top
of your head?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.406
- And there they are.
- (Laughs)

03:58.439 --> 04:00.641
- And I'm off, then.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.511
- Moira, is everything
all right?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.879
You seem a little
distracted today.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.981
- No, I'm-I'm just a little
distracted today.

04:08.015 --> 04:10.050
- I'm having one of those
days myself.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.952
- We're in the midst
of a family crisis,

04:11.985 --> 04:13.821
if you must know!

04:13.854 --> 04:16.757
- Well, I don't wanna pry, so--
- Well, you've cracked me open.

04:16.790 --> 04:20.060
Alexis is pregnant.
- What?

04:20.093 --> 04:24.332
- I know! We discovered the
test in her bathroom today.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.000
- You did?
- And to think when I awoke,

04:27.034 --> 04:29.370
my biggest concern
was how to make

04:29.403 --> 04:30.904
that ragtime medley
of yours work.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.340
- Uh huh...

04:32.373 --> 04:35.075
- It's just flagrant
irresponsibility!

04:35.108 --> 04:38.512
To allow an unscheduled
conception to occur!

04:38.546 --> 04:40.781
- Moira?
- Oh, she has no idea

04:40.814 --> 04:42.750
of the toll a baby can take
on its mother,

04:42.783 --> 04:44.618
or its mother's mother.

04:44.652 --> 04:46.754
- Moira, I'm the one
who's pregnant.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.756
- If only.
- It's true.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.091
I was dropping off Alexis'
course book,

04:51.124 --> 04:52.860
and I had gotten the test
from the pharmacy,

04:52.893 --> 04:54.428
and I was so anxious
to find out,

04:54.462 --> 04:56.697
that I took the test
in Alexis' bathroom.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.669
- Oh Jocelyn, oh Jocelyn!

05:01.702 --> 05:04.505
Oh, what a wonderful surprise
for us all!

05:04.538 --> 05:06.607
Oh!
- I know.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.343
I thought it was menopause
that was making me late,

05:09.377 --> 05:11.445
and giving me the cravings,
and morning sickness.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.013
- I wouldn't know.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.849
- Listen, can you do me
a favour,

05:15.883 --> 05:17.951
and just keep this between
the two of us,

05:17.985 --> 05:20.454
because Roland
doesn't know yet.

05:20.488 --> 05:23.657
- Oh! Oh Jocelyn,
Roland's not the father?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.894
- Of course he is,
I just haven't found

05:26.927 --> 05:28.796
the right time to tell him.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.031
- Don't wait, best to rip
it off like a band aid.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.733
- You're probably right.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.968
It's just that we weren't
expecting this.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.638
- One must prepare
for any event.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.907
Miracles don't take
reservations.

05:41.041 --> 05:41.942
Ahhh! Oh...

05:43.411 --> 05:44.912
- (Sighs)

05:46.814 --> 05:48.582
(Door opens)

05:49.683 --> 05:51.652
- Oh, hi, honey.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.821
- My God, how long have you
been sitting there?

05:53.854 --> 05:55.523
- Oh, I didn't realize it took
you so long

05:55.556 --> 05:57.491
to put your makeup on.

05:57.525 --> 05:59.593
- Can I help you
with something?

05:59.627 --> 06:02.596
- Just wondering how
you're feeling.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.466
- Fine, a little nervous.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.601
- Well, that's understandable,
comes with the territory.

06:09.503 --> 06:12.440
Uh... it might help
if we chat about it.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.076
- Um no, I don't want
to chat about it. I'm late.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.078
- Well, I know you're late,
sweetheart.

06:18.111 --> 06:18.946
- I knew this was gonna happen!

06:21.649 --> 06:23.451
David has already given me
a hard time.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.018
- I know, and believe me,

06:25.052 --> 06:27.521
I will be talking
to David about that.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.760
Now... Ted,

06:32.793 --> 06:35.028
is he being supportive?

06:35.062 --> 06:37.998
- I haven't even told Ted.
- Oh.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.534
- I just wanna do one thing
on my own!

06:40.568 --> 06:43.937
- And you're sure this is
the right one thing to pick?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.473
- Okay, please don't stress me
out about this!

06:45.506 --> 06:47.174
This is supposed to be fun!

06:47.207 --> 06:50.177
- And it will be fun, honey,
it will be, in time.

06:50.210 --> 06:53.514
You know, it will also be
a lot of work.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.948
- I know that!

06:54.982 --> 06:57.217
- And not to mention,
a lot of money.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.986
- Why do you think I've been
saving up my money

06:59.019 --> 07:00.888
from the vet's office?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.923
- How long have you known
about this?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.858
- Oh my God, you are being
so extra right now!

07:04.892 --> 07:06.193
I have to go!
- Okay,

07:06.226 --> 07:08.128
clearly this is not a good time,

07:08.161 --> 07:10.197
but I just want you to know
your mother and I are here,

07:10.230 --> 07:12.800
whenever you feel comfortable
enough to talk,

07:12.833 --> 07:14.602
although I'd suggest
talking to me, and...

07:14.635 --> 07:16.470
not your mother.

07:16.504 --> 07:18.606
- You are making way too big
a deal of this.

07:18.639 --> 07:22.543
If I don't like it, I'll just
give it up, and move on!

07:22.576 --> 07:24.077
Okay?

07:25.513 --> 07:26.480
(Door slams)

07:26.514 --> 07:27.915
(Jazz music plays)

07:31.218 --> 07:32.886
(Bell on door jingles)

07:35.523 --> 07:37.024
- Hmmm.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.726
(Bag rustles)

07:41.795 --> 07:44.031
- Ding, ding!

07:44.064 --> 07:45.899
- Ahem. Hi.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.971
We're actually closed today.

07:51.004 --> 07:53.907
- It's one o'clock on a Friday.

07:53.941 --> 07:56.243
- Okay, is there something
I can help you with?

07:56.276 --> 07:57.945
- Do you give all your
customers this kind

07:57.978 --> 07:59.513
of VIP treatment?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.615
- Actually, I do, and I would
love to keep chatting,

08:01.649 --> 08:05.653
it's just that Patrick and I
were working on fixing a uh...

08:05.686 --> 08:08.055
a light bulb in the back,
so we-- oh, hey.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.057
- Hey, Stevie.
- Hi.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.660
- David and I were just in the
back doing some inventory.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.161
- Yeah.
- Hmm, yeah.

08:14.194 --> 08:15.963
Seems like you guys
are really busy...

08:15.996 --> 08:17.531
at work.
- Uh...

08:18.799 --> 08:21.201
- Ooh, what's that?
- What's what?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.737
- You got a little red um...
is that a bug bite?

08:23.771 --> 08:26.506
Or a little mouth shaped
sunburn?

08:27.875 --> 08:29.743
Looks like a hickey, actually.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.079
- But it's not, it's not a--
it's not a hickey, right?

08:32.112 --> 08:33.847
Because that would be
disgusting,

08:33.881 --> 08:35.182
and wildly unprofessional.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.884
David, did you give me
a hickey?!

08:36.917 --> 08:39.887
- Okay no, I didn't,
I gave you a-a half hickey,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.922
because we haven't had
the time or the privacy

08:41.955 --> 08:43.924
for me to give
you a full hickey!

08:43.957 --> 08:45.893
- If you give me $50 bucks
I'll stand outside,

08:45.926 --> 08:47.294
and tell people
you're on lunch.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.196
- I'll give you 50 cents
to stand outside

08:49.229 --> 08:50.798
and never come back!
- You see,

08:50.831 --> 08:52.733
this is why we can't do
this here.

08:52.766 --> 08:55.135
- Desperate times, huh?
- No, trying times,

08:55.168 --> 08:57.971
nothing about this
is desperate.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.740
It's just that there's a lot
of people at the motel,

08:59.773 --> 09:02.109
and Patrick is renting
a room from Ray.

09:02.142 --> 09:03.777
- Who really likes to chat.
- Yeah.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.647
So there has literally been
zero privacy.

09:06.680 --> 09:10.017
- Well, if you want,
I'm happy to offer you guys

09:10.050 --> 09:12.786
my apartment for the night.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.623
- Why? Why would you do that?

09:15.656 --> 09:18.258
- Because I care about you two.

09:18.291 --> 09:21.662
- Okay, and where will you be?

09:21.695 --> 09:24.832
- Well, if you must know,
work's been really stressful,

09:24.865 --> 09:29.837
so I'm going to take a little
me time at a spa in Elmdale.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.872
- That is super generous,

09:31.905 --> 09:33.140
but wouldn't be a little
bit weird

09:33.173 --> 09:35.142
us having alone time
at your place?

09:35.175 --> 09:36.677
Especially because
you guys have--

09:36.710 --> 09:38.378
- Oh God no! No, we've never--
- No, never, ew!

09:38.411 --> 09:40.748
- We've never done that there.
- Never. I still live there.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.349
- I mean, we could consider it.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.820
- What exactly is the catch?

09:46.854 --> 09:48.722
- No catch.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.627
- David!
- What?

09:53.661 --> 09:56.664
- We'll take the place.
- Okay, we'll take the place.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.666
- Great, and I'll take this.

09:58.699 --> 10:01.001
- So there's a bit of a catch.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.202
(Door opens, slams)

10:04.071 --> 10:07.074
- You know, Moira, it's not
as bad as I thought.
- Mmm...

10:07.107 --> 10:09.042
- If David sells the store,
and uh...

10:09.076 --> 10:11.078
and you get some part time work,

10:11.111 --> 10:13.013
and we get a good price
for the car,

10:13.046 --> 10:15.182
I think we can make it through
the first two years easy,

10:15.215 --> 10:17.384
and then we just have
to figure out preschool.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.656
- John, as much as I appreciate
your budgetary prowess,

10:22.690 --> 10:25.693
it turns out there is no
immediate need for concern.

10:27.795 --> 10:31.364
- Well, now we're all taking
this a little too lightly.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.400
- Alexis isn't the one
who's pregnant.

10:35.068 --> 10:37.705
Someone else is, but don't
press me for details,

10:37.738 --> 10:40.040
because I've been sworn
to secrecy.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.142
- You've been sworn--
- It's Jocelyn!

10:42.175 --> 10:43.911
But you're not supposed
to know.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.879
She hasn't told Roland yet.

10:45.913 --> 10:47.314
- Jocelyn!
- Uh ha.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.883
She was appropriately
gobsmacked herself.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.953
And I must say,
I am entirely relieved.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.756
- Yeah, that's it's not Alexis!

10:55.789 --> 10:57.725
- But save that spreadsheet,
John,

10:57.758 --> 11:01.428
and you might want to add
a line item for prophylactics.

11:01.461 --> 11:04.164
Tomorrow's another day.
- Yeah, well, don't worry,

11:04.197 --> 11:07.000
I've already had a serious
talk with Alexis,

11:07.034 --> 11:09.102
though now I'm wondering
what exactly...

11:09.136 --> 11:10.370
we were talking about.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.106
(Students chatter)

11:17.845 --> 11:19.780
- Um, hey, excuse me,

11:19.813 --> 11:22.315
I'm looking for
the registrar's office.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.384
- It's in there.

11:24.417 --> 11:26.319
- Okay, I'm just like,
a little bit confused,

11:26.353 --> 11:28.455
because on the brochure
it looks like

11:28.488 --> 11:30.958
it's in a moss covered
building by the lake.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.162
So... I'm guessing the quad
is just like,

11:35.195 --> 11:37.297
on the other side
of the building?

11:37.330 --> 11:39.266
- The office is in there,
make a right.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.868
- A 100%.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.339
(Car rumbles)

11:46.373 --> 11:51.211
♪♪♪

11:59.887 --> 12:02.289
(Students chatter)

12:03.323 --> 12:05.859
(Music plays)

12:05.893 --> 12:08.361
- Ooh...

12:08.395 --> 12:10.297
(Music plays on radio)

12:13.333 --> 12:16.269
- Okay, hi. Hi!
- Hmm, what's up?

12:16.303 --> 12:19.139
- I am what this brochure calls
a prospective student.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.540
- Cool, so you're not
enrolled yet?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.176
- No, I am enrolled, um,
prospectively.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.278
I was wondering if there's
like, a campus tour,

12:25.312 --> 12:27.480
or something?
- Wow...

12:27.514 --> 12:30.083
well, it wouldn't be much
of a tour, but...

12:30.117 --> 12:32.052
yeah, I guess I could walk you
back up the hall,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
if you want.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.288
- Okay, it's just that
this brochure is like,

12:35.322 --> 12:37.124
a little bit confusing.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.926
- Yeah, we couldn't afford
in house photography,

12:38.959 --> 12:41.995
so we just used stock images.
See? Watermark there.

12:42.029 --> 12:43.430
(Laughs) This is actually
a still

12:43.463 --> 12:45.365
from "Dead Poets Society."

12:45.398 --> 12:47.534
- I feel like that's false
advertising,

12:47.567 --> 12:50.503
especially considering what
I am paying for these courses.

12:50.537 --> 12:54.141
- Yeah, but you get free coffee
and doughnuts.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.143
Oh, and like, um, an agenda.

12:57.344 --> 13:00.013
- (Groans)
- Yeah, it's off by a day.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.015
So... I wouldn't use it.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.820
- Okay great, I would like
a refund, please.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.890
- Uh, the problem is,
is we don't give refunds.

13:09.923 --> 13:13.226
- Okay, then I guess I would
just like my money back, then.

13:13.260 --> 13:15.528
- Again, we don't give refunds.
- Okay, okay.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.031
This is the first time
that I've ever invested

13:18.065 --> 13:20.133
in anything myself,
and I thought that was like,

13:20.167 --> 13:22.335
the responsible choice,
but clearly,

13:22.369 --> 13:24.604
this is like, a joke school.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.375
- Well, that's why most students
do their courses online.

13:28.408 --> 13:32.212
- Oh. So like, potentially,

13:32.245 --> 13:34.882
I could refund
my refund request,

13:34.915 --> 13:36.549
do all my courses online,
and like,

13:36.583 --> 13:38.852
never have to ever
come back here again?

13:38.886 --> 13:40.553
- That's actually how I keep
my side hustle going,

13:40.587 --> 13:42.589
part time DJ.

13:42.622 --> 13:45.625
Here's my card, in case
you have any problems,

13:45.658 --> 13:47.895
or you wanna go on a date,
or something.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.063
- Okay. Well, I won't be
doing any of that,

13:50.097 --> 13:52.432
but thank you so much.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.401
Ooh!

13:54.434 --> 13:56.169
(Door opens)

13:56.203 --> 13:58.105
- Please, come in, come in.

13:58.138 --> 14:00.240
- Ooh.
- Welcome.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.510
Make yourselves at home.

14:03.543 --> 14:05.545
Just so you know, there's
nothing in the fridge.

14:05.578 --> 14:09.049
Oh, and I marked the booze,
so I'll know if you touch it.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.517
- I noticed the line
is a couple inches above

14:10.550 --> 14:12.319
where the whiskey starts.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.055
- I am stunned by your
generosity.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.490
Where exactly
are you going tonight?

14:17.524 --> 14:19.927
- Out to a spa.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.162
- Which she already told us,
so maybe just say thank you.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.997
- Oh no, I did, I did say
thank you multiple times.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.066
Um, what is the name
of the spa?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.101
- David!
Let's just let her go, okay?

14:28.135 --> 14:30.237
- Okay, yeah.
(Knock on the door)

14:30.270 --> 14:33.540
- Are we expecting company, or?
- N-no, I wasn't!

14:33.573 --> 14:35.475
- Hey, pony!
Are you ready to go?

14:37.144 --> 14:39.346
- What are you doing? I said
I would meet you outside!

14:39.379 --> 14:41.481
- I said I'd help you
with your bags.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.450
- David.
Wow, it's been a while.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.419
- Pony.
- Hey...

14:46.453 --> 14:49.256
- Mm-mm! Ahem!
- Wow, you look good.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.025
Who's this guy?

14:52.059 --> 14:54.261
- This is my... that's--
- Patrick.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.397
- That's Patrick.
- And you are?

14:57.430 --> 14:59.132
- Picking up Stevie.
- Yeah, we're gonna go, so...

14:59.166 --> 15:01.434
- So I'm not getting a name,
then.

15:01.468 --> 15:03.636
- Um, so you and "pony,"

15:03.670 --> 15:05.939
what do you have planned
for tonight?

15:05.973 --> 15:08.675
- Well, it's date night,
so we thought maybe

15:08.708 --> 15:10.510
we'd spend it in the woods.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.312
- Yeah, just galloping around
the woods, huh?

15:12.345 --> 15:14.114
- Yeah, with your "pony."

15:14.147 --> 15:16.149
Not at a spa. So...

15:16.183 --> 15:19.319
I take it you two are still--
- Seeing each other, yes.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.421
As it turns out we are.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.223
- After we all broke up,

15:23.256 --> 15:25.125
Stevie came over to end
things officially,

15:25.158 --> 15:26.693
and it just didn't stick, so.
- Yeah. Yeah.

15:26.726 --> 15:28.461
No, it didn't stick, did it.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.063
- When you say
"we all broke up--"

15:30.097 --> 15:32.299
- So you offering
your apartment

15:32.332 --> 15:34.968
had nothing to do with
any guilt you felt

15:35.002 --> 15:37.404
about harbouring
a little secret?

15:37.437 --> 15:40.640
- Nope. Just trying to be
a good person, so.

15:40.673 --> 15:43.243
We're gonna go,
leave you two lovebirds.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.312
- Unless you two wanna come?

15:45.345 --> 15:47.647
- Nope! I don't think so.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.217
- Come on.
- You do you.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.319
- Good to meet you, man.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.989
(Door shuts)

15:57.257 --> 15:58.691
- So we're gonna talk
about this, right?

15:58.725 --> 16:00.560
- Yep, I'm just gonna grab
that bottle of--

16:00.593 --> 16:02.062
- Whiskey? Yeah.
- Yeah, the whiskey.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.231
(Cars rumbles)

16:04.264 --> 16:06.566
- So Roland, you're probably
wondering why

16:06.599 --> 16:09.236
I'm taking you out
for tacos tonight.

16:09.269 --> 16:12.139
- Well honey, you don't need a
special reason for taco night.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.408
- No, but there is a special
reason tonight.

16:15.442 --> 16:18.611
There's something that I wanted
to talk to you about,

16:18.645 --> 16:20.413
something exciting.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.548
- Oh, hold that thought, honey.

16:21.581 --> 16:24.451
Hey, Johnny, Moira,
Jocelyn's just about to tell me

16:24.484 --> 16:26.453
something exciting,
come and join us.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.589
- Oh, no, no, no, far be it
for us to intrude.

16:29.622 --> 16:32.425
No, I think it's best
that Jocelyn share

16:32.459 --> 16:35.128
this life altering news,
whatever it may be,

16:35.162 --> 16:37.164
on her own.
- Yeah.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.499
And we'll probably take
another table,

16:39.532 --> 16:42.035
because I skipped lunch and
you know me when I'm hungry.

16:42.069 --> 16:43.503
Look out! (Laughs)

16:43.536 --> 16:45.172
Uh, we'll sit over here.

16:45.205 --> 16:47.340
- Johnny, I am not
gonna ask again.

16:47.374 --> 16:48.741
- No, no, no.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.377
- No, in fact I am
gonna ask again.

16:50.410 --> 16:51.811
And again. And again.
- Roland--

16:51.844 --> 16:53.813
- Get over here,
and sit yourself down!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.783
- It's okay Moira, take a seat.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.320
- Okay, okay well, John and I
will just study the menu,

17:00.353 --> 17:02.555
as they keep making amendments.
- Yeah...

17:02.589 --> 17:05.492
- (Sighs)

17:05.525 --> 17:07.360
Hmm...
- So Roland,

17:09.262 --> 17:11.831
you might have noticed
that I've been on a real

17:11.864 --> 17:14.667
Dorito casserole kick lately,

17:14.701 --> 17:17.570
and there's a reason for that.

17:17.604 --> 17:20.207
- Besides wanting to keep me
as your husband?

17:20.240 --> 17:22.709
(Laughs uproariously)
Am I right, Johnny?

17:22.742 --> 17:24.711
- Oh, I don't need to be a part
of this.

17:24.744 --> 17:27.447
- The last time I made
that casserole

17:27.480 --> 17:29.249
was when I was pregnant
with Mutt.

17:29.282 --> 17:32.252
And I've really been craving
that casserole again.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.388
- Yeah.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.490
Well, that's understandable
honey,

17:37.524 --> 17:39.659
I mean, it's a terrific
casserole.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.461
- I'd kill for a casserole
right now.

17:41.494 --> 17:43.463
- Rollie, how are you
not getting this?

17:43.496 --> 17:45.565
- Have we decided?
- I'm pregnant!

17:47.800 --> 17:50.603
- (Gasps)
- We're having a baby.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.639
- Oh my goodness!
- Yeah, Twyla,

17:54.174 --> 17:56.109
I'm gonna have the bottomless
French Onion soup,

17:56.143 --> 17:58.878
and maybe you might wanna drop
a little calamari on the table.

17:58.911 --> 18:02.249
- John! (Gasps)
- Yes! Oh, oh, pregnant?

18:03.583 --> 18:05.185
Wow! Wonderful news.

18:06.519 --> 18:08.855
Hey, congratulations, fella.

18:08.888 --> 18:11.791
- Yes, we are stunned!

18:15.228 --> 18:18.331
- Honey... are you okay?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.335
- Okay? (Chuckles)

18:23.270 --> 18:25.338
(Laughs wildly)

18:25.372 --> 18:27.307
Of course I'm okay!

18:27.340 --> 18:29.342
Oh my God!

18:29.376 --> 18:31.178
We're having a baby!

18:31.211 --> 18:34.381
(Applause)

18:34.414 --> 18:36.883
Champagne for everybody, on me!

18:36.916 --> 18:39.619
- I can't drink, Rollie.
- Oh right, you're driving.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.354
- Uh you know what Twyla,
actually,

18:41.388 --> 18:43.590
let's just do one beer,
one beer for me. Okay?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.358
- Congratulations, you two.

18:45.392 --> 18:48.595
- Well, I can honestly say
from the bottom of my heart,

18:48.628 --> 18:51.364
that I couldn't be happier

18:51.398 --> 18:54.701
that this is happening to you
and your family!

18:56.636 --> 18:58.471
(Crickets chirp)

18:58.505 --> 19:00.607
- So this is for you. Um...

19:01.841 --> 19:04.444
cheers to privacy.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.681
- Sorry, I've just gotta go
through that one more time.

19:08.715 --> 19:11.684
So you dated Jake
and then Stevie dated Jake.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.653
- Mhmm... mhmm.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.688
- And at one point, you all--

19:15.722 --> 19:17.290
- No, see, that's where
you're wrong.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.793
We almost all, but I said no.
- Ah.

19:20.827 --> 19:23.196
- Because Stevie and I agreed
that that would be a bad idea,

19:23.230 --> 19:25.598
but it appears that I'm
the only one that held up

19:25.632 --> 19:27.400
my end of that agreement.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.369
- And you're upset about this
because you still...

19:29.402 --> 19:31.504
- No! I'm not upset!

19:31.538 --> 19:34.407
I-I don't want any of that!
- No...

19:34.441 --> 19:36.376
- It's a principle thing.

19:36.409 --> 19:38.778
And we are getting sidetracked
right now.

19:38.811 --> 19:40.547
Okay? So...

19:40.580 --> 19:43.916
who is feeling sexy?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.985
- Getting there for sure,
I just-you know, I...

19:46.018 --> 19:49.389
I knew you had a rich
dating history, David,

19:49.422 --> 19:51.691
I just didn't expect to be
graced by the presence

19:51.724 --> 19:53.726
of two of your exes tonight.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.895
- Yeah, funny thing,
neither did I. So...

19:59.732 --> 20:01.368
- But...
- Mhmm?

20:02.735 --> 20:04.804
- Given that we only have
the apartment for one night.

20:04.837 --> 20:07.707
- Mmm.
- Maybe it's best if we...

20:07.740 --> 20:09.842
lock that box back up for now?

20:09.876 --> 20:12.845
- I think that's a good idea.
- Mhmm. Mhmm.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.881
- You know what, we didn't even
get into your history--

20:14.914 --> 20:17.250
- Lock it up, David. Lock it up.
- Oh, okay.

20:21.421 --> 20:22.722
- Hey, so I've been thinking
about what you said,

20:22.755 --> 20:25.024
and it is a big expense,

20:25.057 --> 20:26.859
but I think I can find a way
to make it work.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.728
- What's happening?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.863
- Dad's trying to get me
to drop out of college.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.732
- No, that's not what
was happening!

20:32.765 --> 20:35.835
I-I thought we were talking
about something else.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.404
- What else?

20:37.437 --> 20:38.905
- Oh, he thought
you were pregnant.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.608
- What? Ew!
- Well, we all did.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.576
- Oh my God, that's so mean!

20:43.610 --> 20:46.879
- Oh, look who's here.
Where were you all night?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.315
- Um...out-side.

20:50.617 --> 20:51.951
I was outside.

20:51.984 --> 20:53.586
- A little past curfew.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.422
- Oh burn, David.

20:55.455 --> 20:58.491
- I'm sorry, I was processing
Alexis' situation.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.294
- David, Alexis isn't--
- No, it's okay.

21:01.328 --> 21:04.797
I mean, have your fun
now David,

21:04.831 --> 21:06.799
because when the twins arrive,

21:06.833 --> 21:08.801
I'm gonna really need
your help.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.670
- Um, that's a hard pass.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.805
- You're gonna be so involved
in their lives.

21:12.839 --> 21:14.841
- Mm, your body, your problem.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.809
- David, Alexis isn't pregnant.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.979
- Okay, but just picture them
as like, tiny little roommates,

21:20.012 --> 21:21.648
whose tiny little poops
you get to clean up!

21:21.681 --> 21:23.015
- Yeah, thanks so much.
