own desires ahead of everything
else when you left.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.099
Are you angry with me?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.771
Yes, I am angry, Dr. Brennan.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.225
We had a great thing going,
and you just—

14:21.319 --> 14:22.934
You let it fall apart.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.580
J‘J‘ [Whistling]

14:35.667 --> 14:37.407
Ahh. Look at that, huh?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.000
Dad?
Yeah?

14:39.129 --> 14:41.586
Did you kill anybody?
Why you asking me that?

14:41.673 --> 14:44.460
My friends always want to know.
What should I tell them?

14:44.551 --> 14:47.213
You tell your friends
that your dad...

14:47.304 --> 14:50.592
does his duty the best
that he knows how.
All right?

14:50.682 --> 14:54.391
Someday me and you
are gonna talk all about it.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.180
All right?
VVhen?

14:56.271 --> 14:58.637
When you’re older.
When you’re a man.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.190
You gonna go away again?
No. Never.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.401
Because of me?
Because of you.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.444
It’s the best reason ever, huh?

15:06.531 --> 15:09.273
Drink your orange juice.
Here we go.
Let’s eat up, hmm?

15:12.662 --> 15:16.246
Oh. It’s Dr. Temperance Brennan.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.039
Hey, welcome back.

15:18.126 --> 15:20.333
Did you find Homo ﬂoresiencis
in Maluku?

15:20.420 --> 15:23.787
No. Not yet.
Why are you fixing a bus?

15:23.882 --> 15:27.966
You are a highly educated
and fairly intelligent young man.

15:28.053 --> 15:30.294
Gotta pay rent,
save up for tuition.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.094
What happened
to your fellowship?

15:32.182 --> 15:35.345
After you left, the new
forensic anthropologist wasn’t
based at the Jeffersonian.

15:35.435 --> 15:38.598
He was in New York,
so they shut down the program.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.639
I am very, very difficult
to replace.

15:41.733 --> 15:43.439
That you are.

15:43.527 --> 15:46.940
I would like to hire you
to help me.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.816
For how long?

15:48.907 --> 15:50.613
For however long it takes
to identify these remains,

15:50.700 --> 15:52.315
and then I have to get back
to Maluku.

15:52.410 --> 15:55.493
No can do.
I pulled in favors to get thisjob.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.320
Gotta think long-term.

15:57.415 --> 15:59.792
I appreciate
the offer though.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.491
How much would it take?

16:01.586 --> 16:04.498
Because I have
quite a lot of money,
and it’s no use to me in Maluku.

16:12.848 --> 16:16.136
I put Logan down
at 8:00 pm,
after his bath.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.308
| read him a story.

16:18.395 --> 16:19.931
He’s a good sleeper.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.057
You have a glass or two
of wine after that, Carrie,

16:22.149 --> 16:25.016
or did you just go
straight to the vodka?

16:25.110 --> 16:26.850
Don’t do that.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.271
Look, I’ve been sober
for over a year.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.734
So when did you notice
that Logan was gone?

16:35.829 --> 16:38.992
He’s usually up around 6:00.

16:39.082 --> 16:41.619
That’s when I went in,
and he was just—
He was gone.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.541
Where were you, Mr. Bartlett?

16:43.628 --> 16:46.370
Me and Carrie split up last year.

16:46.464 --> 16:49.206
[ Sniffles ]
I got custody of Logan.

16:49.301 --> 16:51.633
Again, I’m asking you.
Where were you
when your son disappeared?

16:51.720 --> 16:54.837
I’ve got family in Delaware—
in Dover.

16:54.931 --> 16:57.217
Got receipts, witnesses.
Whatever you need.

16:57.309 --> 16:59.220
Missing Persons cops—
they got it all.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.267
Trevor’s angry, Agent Booth,

17:01.354 --> 17:03.936
but he would never do anything
to harm Logan.

17:06.109 --> 17:07.895
Thank you for that, Carrie.

17:09.821 --> 17:13.734
Look, I’m a father.
I can only imagine what
you’re going through right now.

17:13.825 --> 17:15.486
I really appreciate
you coming in.

17:15.577 --> 17:18.740
There’s an agent outside
who’s gonna drive you home.
Okay?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.703
- What about me?
- I have a few more questions
for you.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.921
Agent Booth, do you think
that the body in the morgue—

17:27.005 --> 17:29.621
the one they’re talking about
on TV—

17:29.758 --> 17:31.965
Do you think—
It’s not very clear
right now.

17:32.052 --> 17:35.715
If I were you, I’d take that
as a good reason to have hope.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.306
Right?

17:46.024 --> 17:47.810
[Angela Sighs]
Wow.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.766
These really are
the remains of a child, huh?

17:49.861 --> 17:54.321
Yeah. And that about sums up
my total knowledge
on the case.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.068
It’s a male child.

17:56.159 --> 17:59.447
- You like living in Paris?
- Are you kidding?

17:59.537 --> 18:01.198
It’s Paris.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.200
I get to draw
the Eiffel Tower.

18:03.291 --> 18:04.906
Not dead children’s faces.

18:05.001 --> 18:07.287
These remains were found
wrapped in a blanket...

18:07.379 --> 18:09.119
in a shallow grave
along the Potomac?

18:09.214 --> 18:12.001
Yeah. I don’t know
if that’s a blanket.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.582
Um—

18:13.677 --> 18:16.043
Looks like it might have been
cut from something larger.

18:16.137 --> 18:20.005
Yeah, the stitching suggests
that maybe it’s from
some kind of garment,

18:20.100 --> 18:22.341
like a jacket
or a sleeping bag.

18:22.435 --> 18:24.687
What does this look like
to you, Wendell?

18:28.817 --> 18:30.353
Root completion
of the canines.

18:30.443 --> 18:33.310
That, plus the fusion
of the vertebral elements.

18:33.405 --> 18:36.021
You’re suggesting
that this victim
is over three years old?

18:36.116 --> 18:38.732
- Yes.
- Despite his small size?

18:38.827 --> 18:40.943
It’s hard to be sure
in a child this young,

18:41.037 --> 18:43.904
but the eye orbits
are relatively round.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.958
Yes. Angela is right.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.751
About what?

18:50.839 --> 18:53.751
The round eye orbits.
The skull is brachycephalic.

18:53.842 --> 18:55.833
If I were reconstructing the skull,

18:55.927 --> 18:57.883
I’d definitely be going Asian.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.342
[ Saroyan ]
So it can’t be Logan Bartlett.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.053
[Sighs]

19:04.144 --> 19:06.009
Thanks for your cooperation.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.594
Do me a favor, huh?

19:07.689 --> 19:10.351
Quit wasting your time
appreciating my cooperation.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.182
Go find my kid.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.938
Nice man.
You think he killed his son?

19:14.029 --> 19:15.644
I don’t quite get “killer”
off of him.

19:15.739 --> 19:17.695
Ho, ho.
What’s going on here?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.990
- Agent Corby’s moving out
so you can move back in.
-Mmm.

19:21.077 --> 19:24.695
You aren’t going back
to Afghanistan after this, are you?

19:24.789 --> 19:27.166
Because I told Agent Corby
that you needed
your office back.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.375
Don’t you make me
a liar.
Nah. I’m not going back.

19:30.462 --> 19:32.498
Something happened to me
back there that made me realize...

19:32.589 --> 19:34.454
l have to be here for my son.

19:34.549 --> 19:36.460
You almost die or something?

19:36.593 --> 19:38.834
[ Sighs]
I should know better
than to ask.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.055
Anything else
happen to you over there...

19:41.139 --> 19:43.004
that you’d maybe
like to talk about?

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
Little something-something?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.064
-Ahh.
- Huh?

19:50.190 --> 19:52.932
I like the set of her chin.
Right?

19:53.068 --> 19:56.060
Does Dr. Brennan know?
’Course she does.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.645
Sort of takes
the emotional pressure off,
lguess.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.694
Right?
Which means there’s
absolutely no reason...

20:01.785 --> 20:03.741
for the two of you
not to work together,

20:03.828 --> 20:05.864
get the old team
back together,

20:05.955 --> 20:07.741
catch miscreants and killers
and the like.

20:07.832 --> 20:11.245
I’m staying, but I’m pretty sure
Bones is heading back
to the “Machupachooie” Islands,

20:11.336 --> 20:14.453
or whatever they’re called,
to find her missing link to humanity.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.581
Well, we’d all like
for her to find that.
Right? Me too.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.506
No missing link there though,
right?

20:19.636 --> 20:21.922
Honey, ain’t nothin’ missing
off of her.
Right.

20:22.138 --> 20:25.255
You wouldn’t believe
what I went through
to hang on to that.

20:25.350 --> 20:27.887
I never asked you
to give me the ring back.

20:27.977 --> 20:30.810
When I left, you and I
weren’t really precise...

20:30.897 --> 20:32.558
on where we were
as a couple.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.607
You flushed me, Daisy.
How much more clear could it be?

20:35.693 --> 20:38.856
Just to be clear,
in your mind,
we’re no longer engaged?

20:38.947 --> 20:40.983
What?

20:41.116 --> 20:43.323
No.
I thought about you
every day.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.401
- [ Horns Honking]
- [ Man ]
Hey, get outta the way!

20:45.495 --> 20:47.736
Okay. This is very confusing
for me,

20:47.831 --> 20:50.618
because I spent
the last few months
trying to forget about you.

20:50.708 --> 20:53.120
You found someone else
while I was away?

20:55.588 --> 20:59.422
And by “a few”
I mean more than two.
I was completely faithful,

20:59.509 --> 21:01.795
but I don’t blame you
for seeking comfort
in the arms of others.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.501
Blame me?

21:03.596 --> 21:06.554
You looked me in the eye
and told me that your career
would always come first.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.428
l was emulating my mentor,
Dr. Brennan,

21:09.519 --> 21:12.602
and she was wrong,
which means I was wrong too.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.645
l was led astray by my brain.

21:14.732 --> 21:16.688
Well, I need some time to think.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.184
Then you keep the ring.

21:19.279 --> 21:22.521
You want us to be engaged,
you just give it back.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.542
Yes. I’m seeing
Harris lines here in the tibia.

21:40.842 --> 21:43.003
These lines of calcified material
on the shinbone?

21:43.094 --> 21:45.380
Signifies childhood malnutrition.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.180
The skull shows, uh—

21:49.267 --> 21:50.803
I forget what these lesions
are called,

21:50.894 --> 21:53.727
but they’re caused
by iron deficiency, anemia—

21:53.855 --> 21:55.891
Porotic hypersitosis.
Yeah.

21:55.982 --> 21:58.473
Comes from working
on bus engines, I guess.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.776
Well, anyone could learn
the labels, Mr. Bray,

22:01.863 --> 22:04.570
but not everyone
would notice the condition.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.693
Nice. What have you got?

22:06.784 --> 22:10.151
We won’t know for certain
until we get a complete
histological profile,

22:10.246 --> 22:14.831
but it’s looking pretty good
that this kid is
an Asian immigrant.

22:14.918 --> 22:19.378
By “pretty good” Mr. Bray means
a better than 85% chance.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.580
Hey. Hodgins found
some bug evidence.

22:21.674 --> 22:23.756
Hey, Hodgins, what’s up?
Hey, brother.

22:23.843 --> 22:27.381
Wow. What is with this
scuzzy hellhole?

22:27.472 --> 22:30.555
- And where’s my office?
- You see that table over there?

22:30.642 --> 22:33.679
That’s your office.
And you have to share.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.931
Huh.

22:36.022 --> 22:40.891
If these remains are Asian,
that might help explain his size,

22:40.985 --> 22:44.853
and this is all adding up
to the likelihood that this
is not Logan Bartlett.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.529
It’s not Logan Bartlett.

22:46.616 --> 22:50.200
Cam’s bug guy—
really not top-shelf, by the way—

22:50.286 --> 22:54.871
says that insect activity
indicates that this kid died
between six and 12 weeks ago,

22:54.958 --> 22:57.870
but he didn’t take into account
the fact that the kid
was wrapped up.

22:57.961 --> 23:00.703
The blanket
retarded insect activity.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.879
Again, it—
Not a blanket.

23:02.966 --> 23:06.424
Calliphoridae
and Sarcophagidae files
are present as adults...

23:06.511 --> 23:08.843
and early instar larvae—

23:10.974 --> 23:15.217
Okay, upshot—
this child died
at least 16 weeks ago,

23:15.311 --> 23:17.563
long before Logan Bartlett
went missing.

23:17.647 --> 23:21.185
I think we’re all agreed
that this is not the missing child.

23:21.276 --> 23:25.485
Well, maybe not the famous one,
but this is somebody’s missing child.

23:33.371 --> 23:36.454
So you are positively,
abso-tively certain...

23:36.541 --> 23:38.122
that it isn’t Logan Bartlett.

23:38.251 --> 23:41.243
“Abso-tively”?
That’s not a word.
Yes. We are certain.

23:41.337 --> 23:44.670
So you people come back
from the far-flung corners of the earth,

23:44.757 --> 23:46.713
out past the outer suburbs
of Timbuktu,

23:46.801 --> 23:48.382
and you solve the case in a shake?

23:48.469 --> 23:49.925
What’s a shake?

23:50.013 --> 23:53.050
- Three jiffies and a cha-cha.
- Cha-cha-cha.

23:53.141 --> 23:55.302
We didn’t actually
solve the case.

23:55.393 --> 23:58.806
All we’ve done is ascertain
that the remains are not
those of Logan Bartlett.

23:58.896 --> 24:03.265
We still have to figure out
whose remains are in Cam’s lab
and what happened to him.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.523
You are so right, Dr. Brennan.
How could I have taken my eye
off the ball like that?

24:07.614 --> 24:10.401
Blood flow is crucial
to cognitive dexterity.

24:10.491 --> 24:12.356
Perhaps you don’t get
enough exercise.

24:12.452 --> 24:14.659
We figure this out,
Cam has a chance
to keep herjob, right?

24:14.746 --> 24:17.362
That’s what you came back for, isn’t it—
help out Cam?

24:17.457 --> 24:18.822
Abso-tively.

24:20.543 --> 24:23.410
Look, nothing against Carrie,
but you got to admit...

24:23.504 --> 24:26.632
it was crazy to choose
the alcoholic mother
over the father.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.456
lmean, it was just
a bad decision.

24:28.551 --> 24:30.963
Something
was bound to happen.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.464
Sweets.
And ill tell you
something else—

24:32.555 --> 24:34.056
Why you lookin’ at that?

24:34.140 --> 24:36.301
This guy looks you in the eye.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.600
His expressions reach his entire face,
notjust his mouth.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.928
He’s speaking in contractions
instead of formally.

24:42.023 --> 24:45.015
- He was telling the truth?
- Yes. Look. See?

24:45.109 --> 24:47.521
He expands himself outwardly
in this communication.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.819
A liar doesn’t do that.
A liar pulls in.

24:49.906 --> 24:52.613
Not only is this guy telling the truth,
he’s relaying facts.

24:52.700 --> 24:54.156
Forget about this guy.
Okay?

24:54.243 --> 24:56.985
This is a Missing Persons case
right now.
It’s out of my hands.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.662
What’s important right now is
we’re working on a homicide.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.285
What do we have on that?

25:01.376 --> 25:05.244
The remains were wrapped,
which suggests a sense
of ceremony,

25:05.338 --> 25:08.671
a loving burial or,
equally possible, shame.

25:08.758 --> 25:12.467
Which makes sense
’cause the child’s hands
and feet were bound with twine.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.965
- Sex crime.
- Hard not to go there.

25:15.056 --> 25:16.512
Thanks.

25:16.599 --> 25:19.432
Yeah. Hey, uh, Booth,

25:19.519 --> 25:22.352
can I ask you
a personal question?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.599
Oh, that depends.
About you or me?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.852
- Me.
- Shoot.

25:26.943 --> 25:30.856
Okay. Daisyjust wants
to pick up where we left off,

25:30.947 --> 25:32.608
- and I don’t know whether to—
- Move on.

25:33.574 --> 25:35.110
Yeah? Like you did?
You know what?

25:35.201 --> 25:37.283
You asked my opinion, right?
I’m gonna give it to you.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.031
You listening?

25:39.122 --> 25:41.534
Give yourself a chance
to be happy.
Move on.

25:41.666 --> 25:45.500
And that worked for you?
Yeah. It did. It did.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.379
If you don’t mind me asking,
Dr. B., why do you keep
staring at the X-ray?

25:57.473 --> 25:59.725
Because I’m suffering
the nagging certainty...

25:59.809 --> 26:04.849
that my eyes are seeing
something which my brain
refuses to process.

26:04.939 --> 26:07.271
Isn’t your brain supposed
to be the smart one?

26:07.358 --> 26:09.019
Hey, Ange, you want
somethin’ to eat?

26:09.110 --> 26:11.852
I do, yes, but I want it in Paris.

26:14.407 --> 26:18.525
- Are her eyeballs
and brainpan arguing again?
- Yeah. Clash of the Titans.

26:18.619 --> 26:21.702
Got it. There’s nearly
imperceptible damage to the hyoid.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.404
The little boy got strangled.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.706
No, it’s not cracked or crushed.

26:25.793 --> 26:28.205
It’s more like there’s
a hole or a puncture.

26:29.213 --> 26:31.204
I’ll check it out
on the actual bone.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.843
Sweetie?

26:34.927 --> 26:37.418
Sweetie, can I get
some attention over here?

26:37.513 --> 26:40.220
Yeah, uh— Yes.
It’s very good to see you.

26:40.308 --> 26:43.766
Because you are my best friend
and I love you like a sister—

26:43.853 --> 26:48.438
uh, I assume, not having
an actual sister to use as a control.

26:48.524 --> 26:49.980
Right. Yes. Yes, I know.

26:50.067 --> 26:52.194
So, um, what
is the deal with Booth?

26:52.278 --> 26:54.109
Is it weird
seeing him again?

26:54.197 --> 26:56.108
Not at all weird. Very nice.

26:56.199 --> 26:59.783
Are there any
old surges of feelings?
Anything like that?

26:59.869 --> 27:01.825
Booth fell in love in Afghanistan.

27:01.913 --> 27:04.905
Oh. Oh, sweetie,
I’m so sorry.

27:04.999 --> 27:07.661
Why? Are you in love with Booth?

27:07.752 --> 27:11.119
A little bit,
but that’s not what I mean.

27:11.214 --> 27:14.172
Don’t tell me that
you’re happy about him
finding somebody else.

27:14.258 --> 27:15.964
I’m very pleased for him.

27:16.052 --> 27:18.043
A committed, romantic dyad...

27:18.137 --> 27:21.504
is exactly the kind
of relationship Booth
seems to require to be happy.

27:21.599 --> 27:23.965
Did you think
about Booth at all
when you were away?

27:24.060 --> 27:25.550
Yes, I did.

27:25.645 --> 27:28.057
A few times,
I actually dreamed about him.

27:28.189 --> 27:33.024
Oh, well, there you go.
Dreams are very meaningful.
I dreamed about the work we do.

27:33.110 --> 27:34.771
I dreamed
about catching murderers...

27:34.862 --> 27:38.025
and getting justice
for people who were killed.

27:39.450 --> 27:42.988
What does that mean?
It means you’re going
to die loveless and alone.

27:43.079 --> 27:44.865
I don’t follow your reasoning.

27:44.956 --> 27:47.948
Sweetie, can you ask me
how I am, please?

27:48.042 --> 27:49.498
I already know how you are.

27:49.585 --> 27:54.249
You love living in Paris,
and you don’t miss murderers
and violence.

27:55.591 --> 27:57.968
What I did miss is my period.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.848
[Sighs]
[Laughing]

28:02.932 --> 28:06.390
I hope you’re hugging me
because you’re excited
about being an aunt.

28:06.477 --> 28:08.468
No, I’d have to be your sister to do that.

28:08.563 --> 28:11.771
Oh. Which I am, metaphorically.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.565
Yes, you better be,
because I haven’t
even told Hodgins yet.

28:14.652 --> 28:18.236
Anthropologically speaking,
women often confide in other women...

28:18.322 --> 28:20.483
before broaching sensitive subjects
with their mates.

28:20.575 --> 28:22.782
[ Sighs ]
Okay.

28:24.245 --> 28:26.486
[Laughs]

28:26.581 --> 28:30.199
Dr. Brennan was right.
I found a very small puncture
in the boy’s hyoid.

28:30.293 --> 28:32.079
A puncture?
Like he was stabbed?

28:32.169 --> 28:36.378
That’s what I thought,
so I took a close look,
and I found—

28:38.259 --> 28:40.295
Cellulose?
[ Hodgins ]
Wood.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.217
My best estimate
is hardwood—

28:42.305 --> 28:44.261
maple, alder or ash.

28:44.348 --> 28:47.055
I don’t believe a stabbing
would cause this kind of damage.

28:47.143 --> 28:50.727
How else would a sharp piece
of wood come into contact
with the hyoid?

28:50.813 --> 28:52.644
Maybe a toothpick.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.849
Combined with concomitant
damage to the sternum,

28:55.943 --> 28:58.025
I propose the following scenario.

28:58.112 --> 29:01.354
A child swallows something,
perhaps a toothpick.

29:01.449 --> 29:04.907
He chokes. He stops breathing.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.734
Someone tries to save him.

29:06.829 --> 29:09.115
The damage to the sternum
was from the Heimlich maneuver.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.946
What about him
being tied up like this?

29:11.042 --> 29:13.033
Yeah, that mostly looks bad.

29:13.127 --> 29:15.743
[ Brennan ]
There are cultures where
the binding of hands and feet...

29:15.838 --> 29:17.703
is part of the burial ritual—

29:17.798 --> 29:20.926
ancient Jews, some Asian cultures,
including the subcontinent.

29:21.010 --> 29:22.591
Angie says the boy was Asian.

29:22.678 --> 29:24.339
So we’re not looking
at a murder?

29:24.430 --> 29:27.763
We’re looking at negligence
or maybe even an accident?

29:27.850 --> 29:30.341
Logically, I’d say yes.

29:39.111 --> 29:41.147
- Korea.
- Korea?

29:41.238 --> 29:43.524
The boy was wrapped in a kind
of polyester fabric...

29:43.616 --> 29:46.653
which is not legal
in the United States—
it’s flammable—

29:46.744 --> 29:50.862
but it is very common in North Korea.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.493
Mostly in outenNear.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.539
That would explain the malnutrition.

29:54.627 --> 29:56.834
North Korea’s not famous
for its cuisine.

29:56.921 --> 29:59.378
North Koreans aren’t allowed
to leave their country.

29:59.465 --> 30:01.126
A few lucky ones escape,

30:01.217 --> 30:03.378
mainly to rejoin
their families in South Korea.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.970
There’s something else.

30:05.054 --> 30:07.591
The twine there that’s binding
the boy’s hands and feet—

30:07.682 --> 30:10.674
it’s a very heavy
industrial embroidery thread.

30:10.768 --> 30:12.258
Sleeping bags?

30:12.353 --> 30:18.314
Yes. Uh, also casket linings,
moving blankets, horse blankets.

30:18.401 --> 30:22.895
So, we’re looking for
an industrial sewing operation
with a Korean connection.

30:31.205 --> 30:34.572
That is one sweatshop—
an upholsterer
and an awning manufacturer.

30:34.709 --> 30:37.542
Okay, what’s next?
lpchun Industries.

30:37.628 --> 30:38.913

30:39.046 --> 30:41.207
I find this reassuring.

to wear your seat belt.

[ Growls ]

30:55.521 --> 30:59.013
No, you should say
like a flea when referring
to lightning-fast reflexes.

30:59.150 --> 31:02.608
I’m not gonna say
I’m like a flea.
It’s more accurate.

31:02.695 --> 31:04.731
Listen, Bones,
we gotta talk about this.

31:04.822 --> 31:07.859
The way my use
of accurate similes
makes you uncomfortable?

31:07.950 --> 31:11.238
No. Are we gonna
put the old team
back together again?

31:12.288 --> 31:15.246
I dreamed about this.
You did?

31:15.332 --> 31:18.415
Oh. Oh, you mean
you literally
dreamt about it. Right.

31:18.502 --> 31:21.118
So you’re open to the idea?

31:21.213 --> 31:24.376
It’s an anthropological fact
that in any community of individuals,

31:24.467 --> 31:27.049
there is a linchpin
or keystone personality.

31:27.178 --> 31:29.920
Uh, the leader, you mean?
Mmm, not usually.

31:30.014 --> 31:33.222
Mostly, it’s just a member of the group...

31:33.309 --> 31:35.595
who otherwise might seem invisible,

31:35.728 --> 31:40.188
but when she leaves,
the group disintegrates.
“She”?

31:40.274 --> 31:43.437
Yes. I am obviously the linchpin
personality in our group.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.109
But I left too.

31:46.197 --> 31:47.983
Well, after I decided to leave.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.156
No. You left after—

31:51.619 --> 31:54.110
All right, the question is,
are you back?

31:55.915 --> 31:58.031
Well, I’d rather
go back to Maluku,

31:58.125 --> 32:00.662
but I feel,
as the linchpin personality,

32:00.753 --> 32:05.338
that I should put
my own selfish desires
behind the good of this group.

32:05.424 --> 32:06.800
Great. So you’re staying?

32:06.926 --> 32:08.712
Yes.
Great. There you go.

32:08.803 --> 32:11.260
All you have to do is get
Hodgins and Angela on board,

32:11.347 --> 32:14.089
talk the Jeffersonian
into giving us our lab back,

32:14.183 --> 32:15.764
and then track down
all your “squinterns.”

32:15.851 --> 32:18.263
That’s a long list
of very difficult tasks.

32:18.354 --> 32:21.767
Well, it’s not easy
being the linchpin, now, is it?

32:21.857 --> 32:23.313
That’s true.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.435
Did you make a decision
about the ring?

goes back to Maluku,
are you going with her?

- Definitely not.

You told me to have hope.

This is me hoping.

If it’s such a long shot,

Why would he do that
if he loves him so much?

He kidnapped him to hurt his wife.
