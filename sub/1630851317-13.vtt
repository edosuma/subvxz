Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.830 --> 00:07.094
Come in.

00:07.137 --> 00:09.357
- Hey, what're you doing?
- Homework.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.228
Come on, I won't rat you out.
What are you really doing?

00:11.272 --> 00:12.751
Homework.

00:12.795 --> 00:14.927
What have they
done to you?

00:17.017 --> 00:18.322
So, listen,

00:18.366 --> 00:20.846
I was thinking about
running over to Costco

00:20.890 --> 00:22.500
and buying one
of those new Xboxes

00:22.544 --> 00:24.807
and inviting some friends over
to mess around with it.

00:24.850 --> 00:25.895
You a gamer?

00:25.938 --> 00:27.070
No, which means I'll need

00:27.114 --> 00:29.203
somebody to teach me.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.943
Oh, I don't think my mom
will like that.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.423
Oh, she's gonna hate it.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.035
Let's go.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.345
So, what, I'm just supposed to
become a Ravens fan now?

00:41.389 --> 00:43.173
Are they not a better team?

00:43.217 --> 00:44.392
Okay, that's a low blow.

00:44.435 --> 00:45.610
Everything is a low blow.

00:45.654 --> 00:46.829
You are so sensitive.

00:46.872 --> 00:49.092
Sounds like there's
trouble in paradise.

00:49.136 --> 00:50.572
Another marital problem that

00:50.615 --> 00:52.748
we will have to
help them navigate.

00:52.791 --> 00:54.315
They're so lucky
to have us. Mm.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.013
When I was a newlywed,
there was nothing to navigate.

00:57.057 --> 00:58.580
You just did what
your husband said,

00:58.623 --> 01:00.408
and you made sure he never
saw you without makeup.

01:00.451 --> 01:03.802
My husband still has
never seen my naked face.

01:03.846 --> 01:05.239
- Really?
- I sleep in

01:05.282 --> 01:08.894
full makeup and
a girdle. Mm-hmm.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.163
I thought you were
getting yourself some tea.

01:16.206 --> 01:18.165
I never made it to the kettle.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.949
My mother stopped me
to complain.

01:19.992 --> 01:22.995
- About what?
- Everything.

01:23.039 --> 01:24.606
You know, this could be
a new reality show.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.303
An angry Nigerian mother-in-law

01:26.347 --> 01:28.610
slowly destroying
the people she loves.

01:28.653 --> 01:30.438
Call it, <i>Guess Who's</i> <i>
Coming to Dinner...</i>

01:30.481 --> 01:33.441
<i>and Staying. Forever.</i>

01:33.484 --> 01:35.834
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:35.878 --> 01:37.619
I forgot my phone out there.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.229
Don't go back.
I'll order you a new one,

01:39.273 --> 01:41.579
have it delivered to the window.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.146
I think I left it in the gym.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.105
I could get to it from
the side of the house.

01:45.148 --> 01:47.324
Yeah, but that's right next to
"you know whose" room.

01:47.368 --> 01:48.586
Your mother
has a name.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.023
Don't say it out loud,
you'll summon her.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.157
Then she'll come and
tell us one of her stories.

01:54.201 --> 01:56.290
Did I ever
tell you about my royal flush

01:56.333 --> 01:58.553
at the Jackpot
Junction Casino?

01:59.771 --> 02:02.165
I always get the one
about someone

02:02.209 --> 02:05.951
named Frankie Valli
buying her a lemon drop.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.518
We're prisoners
in our own home.

02:07.562 --> 02:09.955
Our moms are the guards,
and this is the hole.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.696
We could
always escape.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.133
Go out the window,

02:13.176 --> 02:14.438
press against
the side of the house

02:14.482 --> 02:15.961
to avoid
the motion lights,

02:16.005 --> 02:19.574
have the Uber pick us up
two blocks down at the 7-Eleven.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.621
Wow, you just had that
plan ready to go?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.754
You are new
to this prison,

02:25.797 --> 02:27.451
I grew up in it.

02:27.495 --> 02:29.149
Well...

02:31.063 --> 02:33.153
I suppose we could
jump that rose bush.

02:33.196 --> 02:35.067
Although, that gravel
on the other side's

02:35.111 --> 02:36.547
gonna make for a tricky landing.

02:38.245 --> 02:41.204
I'm gonna have to change shoes.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.640
- Bob.
- Yeah?

02:42.684 --> 02:43.989
We don't have to do this.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.904
Thank you.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.819
Hey, I found
somebody's phone.

02:47.863 --> 02:49.952
You guys in there?

02:49.995 --> 02:52.433
Bob? Abishola?

02:52.476 --> 02:55.784
Shh. It responds to noise.

03:23.290 --> 03:25.335
Do you have
any eights?

03:25.379 --> 03:27.207
Go fish.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.296
This is a very
strange game.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.254
Yeah, it's
mind-numbingly simple,

03:31.298 --> 03:33.691
which is why it's better to do
when you're drinking.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.127
What isn't?

03:35.171 --> 03:37.608
I knew we were simpatico.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.044
- I'll get the Baileys.
- Mm.

03:39.088 --> 03:40.872
Hey.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.222
Good morning, sweetie.

03:42.265 --> 03:43.266
Hello, Bob.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.137
<i>E karo,</i> Mama Ebun.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.704
Is everything okay?

03:46.748 --> 03:48.880
You and Abishola
- turned in early last night. Yeah.

03:48.924 --> 03:50.360
I'm on this new diet

03:50.404 --> 03:52.232
where you're not
supposed to eat after 6:00,

03:52.275 --> 03:56.148
so what's the point
of being up? Or alive?

03:56.192 --> 03:59.108
While you have an
important guest here,

03:59.151 --> 04:00.588
it might be nice for you to make

04:00.631 --> 04:02.198
a little more effort
to entertain them.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.765
I'm sorry, Mama Ebun.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.201
I meant me.

04:06.158 --> 04:09.249
It is good you and Abishola are
spending so much time together.

04:09.292 --> 04:12.077
Listen, a-about that,

04:12.121 --> 04:12.991
you know,

04:13.035 --> 04:14.384
we love having both of you here.

04:14.428 --> 04:15.777
Of course you do.

04:15.820 --> 04:17.561
We're delightful.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.433
Yeah.

04:19.476 --> 04:22.087
It's just, I feel like I spend
more time with you two

04:22.131 --> 04:23.480
than I do Abishola.

04:23.524 --> 04:25.265
- Well, whose fault is that?
- Yours.

04:25.308 --> 04:27.571
You should always
make time for your wife.

04:27.615 --> 04:28.746
That's what I'm
trying to do.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.879
Then why are you here
whining to us?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.533
I'm not whining.
I just want some alone time

04:32.576 --> 04:34.186
- with my wife.
- Well, maybe your yelling

04:34.230 --> 04:36.406
is why she doesn't want to spend
any more time with you.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.931
How about this? One night
a week, you guys stay out

04:39.975 --> 04:42.325
of our hair.
- Is that too much to ask?
Not at all.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.935
To be honest,

04:43.979 --> 04:46.416
we could use a little break
from you, too.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.026
Seriously?

04:48.070 --> 04:51.291
You know I love you, sweetie,
but you're under foot a lot.

04:51.334 --> 04:53.336
This is my house.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.426
How dare you tell your mother
that your house is yours.

04:56.470 --> 04:57.906
I had a stroke,

04:57.949 --> 04:59.386
God forbid I should stay

04:59.429 --> 05:00.865
a couple of weeks. Mm.

05:00.909 --> 05:02.345
You've been here for two years.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.391
You know what?

05:04.434 --> 05:07.350
Forget I said anything.
Have a great day.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.439
You too, sweetie.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.181
Boy, he's in a mood.

05:12.224 --> 05:15.532
I hope he does not pass
that disposition onto his child.

05:15.576 --> 05:16.968
Huh?

05:17.012 --> 05:19.362
Clearly, they are trying
to have a baby.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.364
Can you think
of any other reason

05:21.408 --> 05:23.540
they would not want
their mothers around?

05:26.108 --> 05:29.503
Hot damn, I'm gonna be a granny.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.985
Of course, Ebun.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.988
I will not tell
a soul.

05:37.032 --> 05:40.252
Hand me the church directory.
I need to spread the good news.

05:40.296 --> 05:41.993
What?

05:42.037 --> 05:44.169
Bob and Abishola are going
to have a child.

05:44.213 --> 05:46.258
- No!
- Yes!

05:46.302 --> 05:50.045
Can you imagine how adorable
a little baby Bob will be?

05:50.088 --> 05:52.221
I need to tell
Sister Comfort.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.266
Shouldn't Bob and Abishola
be the ones

05:54.310 --> 05:55.703
to announce this blessing?

05:55.746 --> 05:56.747
Yes.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.706
Hello, Sister Comfort.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.664
I have wonderful news!

06:04.102 --> 06:07.018
Just saw
my first robin.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.369
Spring is coming soon.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.198
Are you having
another stroke?

06:13.242 --> 06:17.507
No, I'm just
enjoying God's handiwork.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.857
Each day
really is a gift.

06:19.901 --> 06:22.686
It does sound like she's dying.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.688
I'm not dying.

06:24.732 --> 06:28.257
If you must know,
I'm in a good mood because

06:28.300 --> 06:30.651
I'm about to be a grandmother.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.653
Wait, Abishola's pregnant?

06:32.696 --> 06:33.784
They're working on it.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.177
I knew when he started
losing weight

06:35.220 --> 06:36.439
he was up to something.

06:36.483 --> 06:37.832
Oh, he's burning those calories.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.660
Ew.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.226
Are you sure
about this?

06:41.270 --> 06:44.926
I just feel like Abishola
would've told her little sister.

06:44.969 --> 06:47.058
Little? You're older than her.

06:47.102 --> 06:49.452
Yeah, but
- she's taller.
- Bob said

06:49.496 --> 06:50.888
they need more alone time.

06:50.932 --> 06:52.716
What do I need to do,
draw you a picture?

06:52.760 --> 06:55.632
Well, maybe she just
didn't want to jinx it

06:55.676 --> 06:58.113
by sharing it with the person
that she's closest to.

06:59.462 --> 07:00.942
Yeah, I'm sure that's it.

07:02.639 --> 07:04.467
Poor Bob.

07:04.511 --> 07:06.034
What do you mean,
"poor Bob"?

07:06.077 --> 07:07.601
He's gonna be one
of those old dads.

07:07.644 --> 07:10.430
Him and the kid are gonna be
in diapers at the same time.

07:10.473 --> 07:12.475
Well, I'm excited.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.911
This baby could be good for us,

07:13.955 --> 07:16.000
give me more than one winner
in the bunch.

07:16.044 --> 07:17.480
One winner?

07:17.524 --> 07:18.960
She's talking about Bob.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.092
All I'm saying is, it's a chance

07:21.136 --> 07:23.138
to right some wrongs.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.140
What, so are you saying
Douglas and I are the wrongs?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.228
No.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.839
You both fill my heart
with pride.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.762
Your shift was over
a half hour ago.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.634
Yes, it was.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.636
Your mom still here?

07:43.854 --> 07:45.290
Yes, she is.

07:46.727 --> 07:48.598
My mother would
visit for months

07:48.642 --> 07:51.471
and do nothing but nag me
from the couch all day.

07:51.514 --> 07:54.299
Her butt print would haunt me
even after she left.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.519
I feel bad for my mother.

07:56.563 --> 07:59.522
I'm all she has.
My siblings barely speak to her.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.744
See that guilt
- you're feeling?
- Mm-hmm.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.964
It's all part of their
little game, child.

08:07.008 --> 08:09.619
My mother does not play games.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.187
The fact that you
think that,

08:12.230 --> 08:14.276
means she's winning.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.672
Here.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.544
What is this?

08:21.588 --> 08:23.154
I would have made more of
an effort if I hadn't found out

08:23.198 --> 08:25.853
you were having a baby
from Sister Comfort.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.681
What? You're
having a baby?

08:27.724 --> 08:29.552
- No.
- Oh, please.

08:29.596 --> 08:31.772
Don't play coy now.
Your secret is out.

08:31.815 --> 08:33.208
I am not pregnant.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.689
That's why she been
eating such big lunches.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.473
And having erratic mood swings,

08:37.517 --> 08:39.823
from angry to very angry.

08:39.867 --> 08:42.522
You are making me angry now
with this pregnancy nonsense.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.089
I'm going to be
a wonderful godmother.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.743
Ah, who made you godmother?

08:46.787 --> 08:47.831
You think it should be you?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.572
I think we should discuss it.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.443
- Is anyone listening to me?
- Shh.

08:51.487 --> 08:55.273
What if we were
- co-godmothers?
- I could live with that.

08:55.317 --> 08:58.102
Well, let's do that then.

09:00.452 --> 09:02.716
Ooh, you look
a little cranky.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.848
Let me get you twoa snack.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.767
Apparently, my mother has been
telling everyone I'm pregnant.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.639
Well, how the hell
did she get that idea?

09:12.682 --> 09:15.076
I was just telling her we barely
get any time together.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.991
- Oh, Bob.
- What?

09:17.034 --> 09:19.602
Why would two married people
want to be alone?

09:19.646 --> 09:22.431
To look at a suspicious mole

09:22.474 --> 09:25.347
on the husband's back?

09:25.390 --> 09:27.001
Now she will never give up

09:27.044 --> 09:29.438
on this ridiculous baby idea.

09:29.481 --> 09:31.658
Is it?

09:31.701 --> 09:34.356
- What?
- Ridiculous.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.488
Yes.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.273
We talked about this.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.318
I know, but that was before.

09:40.362 --> 09:41.493
Before what?

09:41.537 --> 09:43.408
Spending time with Dele.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.019
He's such a great kid.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.803
You can't help
but wonder

09:46.847 --> 09:48.849
what kind of kid
we would have.

09:48.892 --> 09:51.112
I can help but wonder.

09:52.374 --> 09:55.116
You know what?
- Forget I said anything.
- Okay.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.161
Yeah, just forget it.

10:07.955 --> 10:10.871
Oh, great, you're here.
Please, sit down.

10:10.914 --> 10:13.003
Are you coming back
to take my job?

10:13.047 --> 10:14.352
No, I would never.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.311
Oh, thank God.

10:16.354 --> 10:18.661
Don't thank God yet.
Someone is

10:18.705 --> 10:20.010
coming for your jobs.

10:20.054 --> 10:22.970
Someone younger and smarter.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.232
Who is coming?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.495
Bob and Abishola
are trying to have a kid.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.670
No!

10:27.714 --> 10:28.671
Yes.

10:28.715 --> 10:30.891
That is wonderful news.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.980
Stop smiling,
you fool.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.590
The moment
the child is born,

10:34.634 --> 10:36.679
we are on an
18-year countdown

10:36.723 --> 10:38.812
until he inherits
the MaxDot throne.

10:38.855 --> 10:41.336
Yes, he, she, or they

10:41.379 --> 10:43.033
will certainly be put in charge.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.122
I would welcome a leader
that has a mix

10:45.166 --> 10:48.038
of Abishola's relentless drive
and Bob's tenderness.

10:48.082 --> 10:50.693
Like a teddy bear with talons.

10:50.737 --> 10:53.696
There will be no company
to work for.

10:53.740 --> 10:56.873
Often, the passion
for a family-run company

10:56.917 --> 10:59.136
only lasts one generation.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.356
You think Bob's kid will sell?

11:01.399 --> 11:02.618
Of course.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.576
He will not care about socks.

11:04.620 --> 11:06.448
He will only care
about going to the club

11:06.491 --> 11:09.407
and getting jiggy with it.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.235
I don't like him.

11:11.279 --> 11:13.760
He hasn't even been born yet,
and I do not like him.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.936
That baby is no threat to you.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.982
I was the one who was
going to be in charge.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.509
Goodwin,

11:24.553 --> 11:25.728
we love you

11:25.772 --> 11:28.122
and all you've done
for the business, but...

11:28.165 --> 11:30.733
we're Wheelers.

11:30.777 --> 11:33.562
Well, Bob Wheeler

11:33.605 --> 11:35.956
promised me I would take over
once he left.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.871
- I'm sorry?
- What?

11:37.914 --> 11:41.004
I have a signed statement
on a Wendy's napkin.

11:42.310 --> 11:44.138
And where
is this napkin?

11:48.490 --> 11:50.231
In a safe place.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.496
Yeah, I don't know if a napkin
will hold up legally.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.716
I mean that genuinely,
I have no idea.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.892
Why was I never told?

11:58.935 --> 12:01.590
None of this matters
if Mr. Wheeler has a child.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.855
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

12:05.899 --> 12:07.683
To get a baby gift.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.337
Are you sure?

12:09.380 --> 12:12.209
When you walk out that door,
you have chosen your side.

12:16.257 --> 12:17.737
Oh, my God.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.565
This baby is already
tearing us apart.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.527
Well, here they are!

12:25.570 --> 12:28.530
Ooh. The bringers of life.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.837
I have wanted
to change a diaper

12:30.880 --> 12:32.926
since I saw the movie <i>
Three Men and a Baby,</i>

12:32.969 --> 12:36.843
because I was one man
with no baby.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.801
That's very sweet, guys,

12:38.845 --> 12:40.455
but there has been
a misunderstanding.

12:40.498 --> 12:42.457
Eat this eba.

12:43.545 --> 12:45.373
I'm not hungry right now.

12:45.416 --> 12:48.332
Eat it. Your cousin Bisi ate it
during her pregnancies

12:48.376 --> 12:50.770
and all her children
are over six feet.

12:50.813 --> 12:53.598
And she and her husband
are both little people.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.819
Everyone is getting
ahead of themselves.

12:56.863 --> 13:00.040
Abishola, I just want to
say thank you.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.738
I'd given up on the idea
of becoming a grandmother,

13:02.782 --> 13:04.479
and then this came
out of nowhere.

13:04.522 --> 13:08.309
Like the time Frankie Valli
bought me a lemon drop.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.355
I have to say,

13:11.399 --> 13:14.141
this is...
this is the most...

13:14.184 --> 13:15.490
No, no, no, please don't.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.057
Let your uncle cry.

13:17.100 --> 13:18.667
After all our struggles,

13:18.710 --> 13:21.061
he is excited
to have a baby around.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.585
Yes. That.

13:23.628 --> 13:25.587
Listen, I don't want to
disappoint anyone,

13:25.630 --> 13:27.763
but Abishola and I
talked about it,

13:27.807 --> 13:30.070
and we're not sure
we're gonna do the kid thing.

13:30.113 --> 13:31.985
What?
Yes, you will.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.595
I have already told everyone.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.814
Well, you should not
have done that.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.076
This is my fault.

13:36.119 --> 13:38.643
I didn't mean to give you
the wrong idea.

13:38.687 --> 13:41.081
Do you really not want a child?

13:41.124 --> 13:42.952
Uh... You see?

13:42.996 --> 13:44.519
Your husband wants a child.

13:44.562 --> 13:47.827
You are denying him the chance
to continue his family name.

13:52.701 --> 13:53.833
I'm sorry.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.664
I know everyone here's
intentions are good,

13:59.708 --> 14:01.231
but I think we just need
a little space.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.233
This is a complicated situation.

14:03.277 --> 14:07.063
It is not complicated.
We want a child.

14:07.107 --> 14:07.977
We do.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.458
We really do.

14:12.764 --> 14:14.592
I am so sorry about that.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.774
Wow, she's like a ninja.

14:32.175 --> 14:34.134
Can I join you?

14:34.177 --> 14:35.265
What happened?

14:35.309 --> 14:36.919
I fell out the window
following you.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.486
What do you think happened?

14:38.529 --> 14:40.923
That rose bush was tricky.

14:40.967 --> 14:44.318
That makes me feel
much better.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.667
How did you find me?

14:45.710 --> 14:47.625
You know that app
you track Dele on

14:47.669 --> 14:48.626
with your phone?

14:48.670 --> 14:50.672
- You did that?
- Sorry.

14:50.715 --> 14:51.934
Do not be.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.197
Tracking someone
means you love them.

14:58.245 --> 14:59.768
A child would require me

14:59.811 --> 15:01.465
to take time
away from the hospital.

15:01.509 --> 15:03.598
That's true.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.817
I would also need to delay
going to medical school

15:05.861 --> 15:07.558
for at least a year.

15:07.602 --> 15:10.126
Yeah, I guess you would.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.736
I have concerns about

15:11.780 --> 15:14.217
taking care of a newborn
and your mother,

15:14.261 --> 15:16.480
who, after a few drinks,
is fussier than a baby.

15:17.917 --> 15:21.485
Got to be careful not to mix up
their bottles.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.534
So many people want this.

15:26.577 --> 15:30.277
What they want doesn't matter.

15:30.320 --> 15:33.193
But you want it.

15:33.236 --> 15:36.457
What I want is
for you to be happy.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.241
And if you don't want
to have a kid,

15:38.285 --> 15:40.113
then I support that.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.552
I'm not sure what I want.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.772
Wait, I thought you were
a hard no.

15:47.816 --> 15:50.688
Because up until today,
I thought you were as well.

15:52.429 --> 15:55.693
Are you saying
you want to have a kid?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.437
I'm saying
I'm no longer a hard no.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.049
Huh.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.224
Okay.

16:05.877 --> 16:07.444
Okay.

16:07.488 --> 16:08.968
♪ Into the sun

16:10.012 --> 16:13.363
So... Let's just drink
while I still can.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.147
You got it.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.076
Hey, Goodwin.

16:30.119 --> 16:31.773
Hello.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.343
I just want you to know

16:36.386 --> 16:38.519
that I fully support
Bob's choice

16:38.562 --> 16:40.782
in putting you in charge
one day.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.610
Thank you.

16:42.653 --> 16:44.960
And I'm happy to
help throw overboard

16:45.004 --> 16:47.571
any family member who disagrees.

16:48.616 --> 16:51.749
You know, so long as there's
a place for me on that boat.

16:52.707 --> 16:54.796
I will keep that in mind.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.363
Great.

16:58.800 --> 17:01.455
You look handsome today.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.165
Hey! My favorite coworker.

17:16.209 --> 17:19.081
I was just thinking...

17:19.125 --> 17:21.866
about how much I love
working on the floor.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.477
Under you.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.652
Thank you.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.828
I would never abandon this place

17:26.871 --> 17:28.830
the way cuckoo Christina did.

17:28.873 --> 17:31.050
I'm loyal,
like a hound dog.

17:31.093 --> 17:34.749
All I need is a pat on the belly
once in a while.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.273
And my old office back
and a company car.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.276
I will think about it.

17:41.277 --> 17:44.106
Take your time.

17:47.457 --> 17:49.024
You look handsome today.

17:52.549 --> 17:55.248
- Hello, cousin.
- Yes?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.511
Is there something
you would like to tell me?

17:57.554 --> 17:58.555
No.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.254
I'm just here
to make copies.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.734
- Always the hard worker.
- Mm-hmm.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.520
I will remember that
when I rise to power.

18:06.563 --> 18:08.522
Interesting.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.785
We will see what the Wheeler
child has to say about that.

18:10.828 --> 18:14.745
Haven't you heard?
There is no Wheeler child.

18:16.007 --> 18:18.009
You have old
information, cousin.

18:18.053 --> 18:20.969
Abishola is no longer
a hard no.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.493
Where did you hear this?
Who-who is your source?

18:23.537 --> 18:25.887
Like I said,

18:25.930 --> 18:27.845
I am just here to make copies.
