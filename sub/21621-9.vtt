00:00.100 --> 00:02.302
CPK Sports presents

00:02.369 --> 00:05.405
Jeff Gordon, a four-time
NASCAR Cup Series Champion.

00:05.471 --> 00:07.875
The youngest winner
of the Daytona qualifier

00:07.941 --> 00:10.410
and he kind of looks like Tom Cruise.

00:10.811 --> 00:13.413
With Michael Strahan,
a Super Bowl Champion,

00:13.480 --> 00:17.951
an NFL Hall of Famer
and he bakes a killer ricotta tart.

00:18.986 --> 00:23.190
Together, they're in a car versus
the mean streets of New York City.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.193
This might get real right here.

00:26.793 --> 00:29.096
This is Carpool Karaoke Tonight.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.502
-What's up, big papa?
-What's up, Mike?

00:36.170 --> 00:37.104
-Excited, man.
-How are you, buddy?

00:37.171 --> 00:40.541
-I'm good, man. You ready to go?
-Oh, I am.

00:40.607 --> 00:42.609
-Seatbelt on, brother.
-Wait a minute.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.983
-So you wanna drive?
-Of course I wanna drive.

00:55.923 --> 00:57.624
-Are you ready?
-OK. Let's do this.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.729
Gotta wake this day up,
get this day going the right way.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.768
I'm getting driven around by Jeff Gordon
and you know what that does to me?

01:29.356 --> 01:30.858
Not really you
but you know what I mean.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.806
It's gonna be what, Jeff?
It's gonna be what?

01:58.719 --> 01:59.853
I need two breaths.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.156
It's getting steamy in here.

02:04.324 --> 02:06.293
I can make some evasive action right here.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.062
That went smoothly. I personally wouldn't
have been able to make that move.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.064
-You would've slammed the brakes.
-I would've slammed on the brakes.

02:11.064 --> 02:14.635
I don't know who was next to me
but I think I just pushed them over.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.171
He's doing it to me again. Hold on.

02:17.237 --> 02:18.338
-No way.
-No, you ain't.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.942
Ain't none of that cutting in on us.
I got Jeff Gordon driving this puppy.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.111
Now, this guy, see?

02:24.178 --> 02:26.246
I could do that to the van,
I don't know if I could do that.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.449
These New York City yellow cabs.
No respect for Mr Gordon.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.084
-This might get real right here.
-Yeah.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.087
-That's how I do it.
-You are no joke right now.

02:34.121 --> 02:36.190
See, that's that New York driving
right there, man.

02:36.256 --> 02:39.193
When I first came to New York,
I was like I'll never drive in this city.

02:39.259 --> 02:42.262
There are no lanes,
there's no discipline, nothing.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.431
See, that's exactly
why I love driving in this city.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.233
No, but now I love it.
I'm like a cab driver.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.368
Maybe you could be a race car driver

02:48.435 --> 02:50.370
if you like driving in the city.
I'm telling you.

02:50.437 --> 02:52.472
But you got to hold your pee too long.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.274
Why do you think I retired?

02:57.010 --> 02:59.947
You know what?
I've been a fan of yours forever

03:00.013 --> 03:01.782
and you've gone through quite a few looks.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.619
I mean, seriously, you really have and...

03:06.820 --> 03:07.654
This is true.

03:07.721 --> 03:12.059
But this was not the Jeff Gordon I was
used to seeing, like, back in the day

03:12.059 --> 03:15.128
-so I brought a few little things here.
-Great. I can't wait.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.698
These looks are on the comeback.

03:17.764 --> 03:20.767
They really are. I mean, come on, man.

03:20.834 --> 03:25.372
Who could forget about a mullet, OK?

03:25.439 --> 03:27.107
And then who can forget your little...

03:30.143 --> 03:30.978
That's the Jeff.

03:31.078 --> 03:32.546
No, I wish I could grow
a moustache like that.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.649
That's the Jeff Gordon
that I know right here.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.085
Yeah, baby. If we got out of this car
and say who am I,

03:38.151 --> 03:40.487
they'd go, "Oh, my God, Jeff Gordon!"

03:44.324 --> 03:46.360
I had this made up just for you.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.128
Oh, I get the gap.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.731
-Think I can pull off the gap?
-You could pull of the gap.

03:53.467 --> 03:56.003
Hey, if my teeth look like that,
we're in trouble.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.973
Oh, my, you don't have to...
Take that out, man. That's disturbing.

04:01.542 --> 04:04.411
This is gonna make me sweat
because this extra hair,

04:04.478 --> 04:06.313
you know, it's like a workout.

04:06.713 --> 04:10.150
Oh, now, hold on. I heard a little bit
of something about you and your workout.

04:10.217 --> 04:12.686
-And what is that?
-Something about Jane Fonda workout?

04:12.753 --> 04:16.589
Oh, man. I was a kid. I didn't know
any better. Now, when I was a kid...

04:16.656 --> 04:19.059
Did you get into the leotards
and the whole thing?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.661
I did not wear the leotard, Jeff.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.397
But I do have a song that I think
goes along with this.

04:27.467 --> 04:28.769
-You gotta whip your hair.
-Oh, yeah.

04:31.205 --> 04:32.639
-Jazzercise, right?
-Yeah.

04:38.645 --> 04:40.447
-Did you just do that move?
-I did.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.083
-Did you just really do that?
-Isn't that one of her moves?

04:47.955 --> 04:52.860
Let's get physical, baby. Yeah.
Let me hear that body talk, people.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.628
Crazy thing, it's New York,
nobody's looking at me like I'm strange.

04:54.695 --> 04:58.098
-Yeah, New York...
-They're like, go ahead.

05:00.267 --> 05:01.568
Oh, boy.

05:03.036 --> 05:06.373
You know, when I was 13,
I grew up in Germany

05:06.440 --> 05:09.343
and, you know, I wasn't playing sports,
I wasn't doing anything.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.445
I was kind of like a chunky kid.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.448
-And my brothers would call me Bob.
-Bob?

05:14.515 --> 05:16.750
I was the youngest of six so I thought
cool, they gave me a nickname.

05:17.251 --> 05:19.520
And then they told me it meant
"Booty on Back".

05:19.586 --> 05:21.922
-What?
-I had a fat butt.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.260
So I bought the Jane Fonda VHS tapes
and that's what I did.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.629
I literally would do the leg lifts.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.565
-But that was it, I actually--
-So did it work?

05:31.632 --> 05:34.368
Well, I guess so.
My booty's not that big anymore.

05:37.404 --> 05:39.840
-I hear you've got, like, a clothing line.
-Yeah.

05:39.907 --> 05:42.276
I heard that you have
an underwear line, is that right?

05:42.342 --> 05:43.577
Yeah, man.

05:43.644 --> 05:46.847
Do you do, like, the design,
the modelling for the...

05:46.914 --> 05:50.751
OK, this is the thing. I volunteered
to be the underwear model for my own line

05:50.817 --> 05:51.952
and I was told I couldn't do it.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.088
Wait, wait a minute.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.957
Little upset about it
to be honest with you

05:57.090 --> 05:59.426
because my underwear
modelling career is dead.

06:00.294 --> 06:04.097
But you endorse a lot of stuff.
You got a lot of products yourself.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.466
-So let's play a little game.
-OK.

06:06.533 --> 06:10.504
I'm gonna give you some real thing that
you endorsed and some fake products

06:10.571 --> 06:13.607
and I want you to tell me what's real,
what's fake. Are you ready?

06:13.674 --> 06:15.876
It's called "What Don't You Do?"

06:18.879 --> 06:21.415
Alright, here we go.
The Jeff Gordon bowling ball.

06:21.481 --> 06:23.250
-Jeff Gordon...
-Oh, yeah. I've bowled that ball.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.257
OK, the Jeff Gordon charm bracelet?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.193
Oh, I'm gonna say real.

06:36.463 --> 06:41.301
Real? You got it. How about
the Jeff Gordon computer mouse?

06:41.368 --> 06:43.904
Yeah, we did those. I mean, think of it.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.340
A mouse shaped like a race car?
That's cool.

06:50.143 --> 06:54.081
This one here I was surprised and I was
like, "Man, I can't believe this."

06:54.114 --> 06:56.984
-The Jeff Gordon personal lubricant.
-No.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.286
-That was a fake product.
-I was gonna say.

06:59.353 --> 07:01.255
Thank God I said no to something.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.762
How about the Jeff Gordon mailbox cover?
I don't like the way my mailbox looks.

07:09.162 --> 07:10.030
I say, no.

07:13.467 --> 07:14.568
Yes, you did.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.674
How about this one?
Jeff Gordon's girl's toddler dress.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.410
Oh, I really hope we did not make those.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.649
You made those.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.227
-I may know a few lyrics.
-I think you will.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.934
That made my life.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.805
-I don't know anything from this point on.
-Alright.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.374
Oh, man.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.444
-That was awesome.
-I just needed you

08:30.511 --> 08:35.482
driving me in New York City
to hit me with your lyric out of E.I..

08:37.049 --> 08:41.321
And I will admit graciously
as much as I possibly can

08:41.388 --> 08:45.292
that I may have benefitted from it,
you know.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.760
Ain't nothing wrong with that.

08:49.730 --> 08:52.766
-I love this. It's a good song, man.
-Oh, man, Chainsmokers.

08:52.833 --> 08:55.269
Get you fired up. Let's see what you got.

09:54.962 --> 09:55.963
Yeah.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.131
Great song!

09:58.932 --> 10:01.702
-I hear you're a big car collector.
-Yeah, man, I love cars.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.204
And I'll be honest with you,
it's a thrill for you to drive me

10:04.271 --> 10:06.173
but I've always wanted to race you.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.609
So I have a little something set up.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.577
-Oh, you do?
-Yeah, yeah, if you don't mind.

10:10.978 --> 10:15.849
-I would love to race you in a car race.
-In a race. We're not gonna run.

10:15.916 --> 10:18.318
-I mean, there's wheels and tyres.
-There's wheels and tyres.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.655
-Here we are.
-I look forward to this challenge.

10:43.944 --> 10:47.114
-I knew you were up to something.
-I'm not up to anything. We got wheels.

10:47.114 --> 10:48.382
There's no motor on this.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.751
You do have the motor,
it's called your legs.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.153
Oh, do you see my legs?
Look at those legs.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.927
I don't know if you guys fully know
what you're getting yourself into here.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.062
-It could get ugly.
-Even before we start.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.399
-I'mma block you.
-No, you won't.

11:05.465 --> 11:06.967
The power leg is feeling good.

11:08.302 --> 11:12.172
Gentlemen, on your mark, set...

11:16.210 --> 11:16.944
...go.

11:17.077 --> 11:19.079
What you got, Mike? What you got?

11:37.397 --> 11:39.099
He's behind you, he's behind you

11:39.099 --> 11:40.434
What happened, Mike?

11:41.568 --> 11:42.769
Yeah!

11:43.937 --> 11:44.872
What was that?

11:48.108 --> 11:50.143
-What happened, Mike?
-Equipment failure.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.514
Flawless gear shifting
is what that was all about.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.182
I do have one more thing to show you.

11:55.249 --> 11:57.117
-What?
-Our victory dance.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.919
-You don't have to show it.
-Oh, yeah.

12:01.255 --> 12:05.692
Yeah! Yeah, victory is mine!

12:07.060 --> 12:07.961
Get down.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.132
-I am sad I didn't get to see yours.
-No, you're not.
