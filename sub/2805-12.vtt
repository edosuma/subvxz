12:32.127 --> 12:33.295
(TAPPING ON GLASS)

12:36.256 --> 12:37.716
PETER: <i>Looks like we have a deal.</i>

12:41.803 --> 12:44.264
The signal is a watch,
worn on the left hand,

12:44.348 --> 12:45.891
banded upside down.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.809
What time?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.896
It should be set to 10:20.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.815
Happy?

12:54.316 --> 12:57.319
That you'll soon be serving
two consecutive life sentences?

12:57.402 --> 12:59.321
Yeah, I'm ecstatic.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.492
I gave you what you wanted.

13:05.035 --> 13:06.578
Now it's my turn.

13:21.635 --> 13:24.221
PETER: You're not going in
until we know the signal works.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.931
And if it does...

13:27.057 --> 13:30.519
Just in case I need to be
in contact with you.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.728
You sure you're up for this?

13:32.563 --> 13:35.274
I wish I could say
absence made the heart grow fonder.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.734
Jones, how we looking?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.945
We've got eyes and ears on Diana.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.698
-Diana, you with us?
-DIANA: <i>Copy that.</i>

13:50.622 --> 13:53.041
It looks like somebody's approaching.
Here we go.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.549
Lovely day.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.890
I like your watch.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.601
You want something taken care of?

14:10.976 --> 14:12.769
You tell me what you want me to do.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.104
I do it, you pay.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.689
That's the deal.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.775
I don't discuss the job
till we're safely indoors.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.861
Given my line of work,
you can't be too careful.

14:32.915 --> 14:34.416
(CAMERA CLICKING)

14:34.958 --> 14:37.711
Peter, we've got a hitch.
Diana's following our suspect.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.963
-No clue where they're headed.
<i>-Did you ID him yet?</i>

14:44.551 --> 14:46.261
Yeah. Conrad Worth.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.640
He was a suspect in an S.E.C.
investigation a few months back.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.683
Never did pin anything on him,

14:51.767 --> 14:53.602
but he's looking really shady
right about now.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.688
Peter, I don't like this.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.273
<i>Someone backing her up?</i>

14:58.357 --> 15:00.234
Yep, I am.

15:01.568 --> 15:04.279
Diana called an audible.
She's following the suspect.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.823
Make it quick in there.

15:21.839 --> 15:23.215
Neal.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.677
I hate for you to see me like this.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.808
Do you remember what
my last words to you were?

15:34.810 --> 15:36.061
"I'll see you soon."

15:37.354 --> 15:38.605
Here you are.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.732
It's like something out of a novel.

15:40.816 --> 15:45.070
Yeah, the kind you buy in an airport
and then leave in your seat-back pocket.

15:45.153 --> 15:48.156
Come on, I'm still me.

15:48.991 --> 15:50.742
I'm still Rebecca.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.327
Don't you see that?

15:52.661 --> 15:54.037
When I first met you,

15:54.121 --> 15:57.207
what I saw was the innocence of Kate,

15:57.457 --> 15:59.710
the wit of Sara, the allure of Alex.

15:59.793 --> 16:02.629
Exactly. I'm the perfect woman for you.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.299
No, you made yourself into that,

16:05.382 --> 16:09.261
into something you're not 'cause that's
the job you were hired to do.

16:10.095 --> 16:12.890
What you are is a murderer.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.476
You can't separate the woman
you fell in love with

16:16.560 --> 16:18.437
from any of my identities.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.148
It turned real.

16:21.857 --> 16:24.276
You saw the true me.

16:24.860 --> 16:26.445
And I know you.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.406
I can tell you still have feelings for me.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.494
Rebecca, Rachel,

16:34.620 --> 16:36.246
and whatever name
you decide to call yourself

16:36.330 --> 16:38.582
in the cafeteria line...

16:39.416 --> 16:40.667
It's over.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.881
See, I can see what you're doing.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.008
That slick facade.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.677
It means you feel threatened.

16:50.761 --> 16:54.348
Neal, I can see
right through all your lies.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.147
I admire the minimalist touch.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.565
We just moved in.

17:03.649 --> 17:06.610
My partners and I,
we come and go as we please.

17:06.693 --> 17:11.114
And besides, this day and age,
what more do you need?

17:16.995 --> 17:18.539
It's lovely.

17:18.622 --> 17:20.791
Now, can we get down to specifics?

17:20.916 --> 17:22.042
It's funny.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.293
With all I've heard about you,

17:23.377 --> 17:26.171
I was expecting someone different.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.134
Please, sit down.

17:32.678 --> 17:34.012
Talk to me, Jones.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.526
I've got eyes on Diana.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.486
They're on his terrace.

17:49.987 --> 17:52.155
First sign of trouble, I'm in.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.952
You're not the only job on my horizon.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.413
Please tell me I'm not wasting my time.

18:01.832 --> 18:04.418
When I first heard about you,
it was only in whispers.

18:04.501 --> 18:06.962
Your exploits are the stuff of legend.

18:07.504 --> 18:08.797
There was one story.

18:08.881 --> 18:10.048
You couldn't forget it if you've heard it.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.551
Some friends of mine,
they saw it with their own eyes.

18:13.343 --> 18:16.889
Caracas, May 2009,

18:17.181 --> 18:18.348
remind me.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.601
How did that go down?

18:21.185 --> 18:22.895
Enough with the closure, Neal.

18:23.353 --> 18:25.397
I need you to ask about...

18:27.900 --> 18:30.485
Caracas, May 2009.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.321
I want to know what happened.

18:32.404 --> 18:34.615
Neal, are you helping Agent Burke

18:34.698 --> 18:37.492
make sure some bumbling agent
is safely vetted?

18:37.618 --> 18:39.745
That's so beneath you. Come on.

18:42.831 --> 18:44.333
Then I guess we're
out of things to talk about.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.667
All right.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.837
You want to know some things?
I got some questions, too.

18:50.047 --> 18:52.799
One for one,
we answer each other truthfully.

18:52.883 --> 18:54.760
-Okay.
-But if you lie to me,

18:54.843 --> 18:56.345
I lie to you.

18:56.553 --> 19:00.807
And besides, lovers are experts
at sniffing out one another's deceptions.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.312
You know, what you're
asking me to admit to

19:05.395 --> 19:06.855
could get me thrown in jail.

19:06.939 --> 19:08.232
Are you wearing a wire?

19:08.649 --> 19:09.816
Please.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.443
Then let me be blunt.

19:11.777 --> 19:13.612
I don't discuss past jobs.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.073
Well, let me be blunt.

19:16.156 --> 19:18.158
I'm not sure you are who you say you are,

19:18.242 --> 19:19.785
so tell me what I need to know.

19:22.788 --> 19:24.039
The story, Neal.

19:24.456 --> 19:25.791
<i>We're running out of time.</i>

19:25.874 --> 19:27.251
REBECCA: How about I go first?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.294
Something light to warm us up?

19:29.378 --> 19:30.754
(NEAL CLEARS THROAT)

19:31.797 --> 19:33.715
Do you think you're smarter

19:33.799 --> 19:35.384
than your old friend Peter Burke?

19:35.467 --> 19:36.635
Yes.

19:36.969 --> 19:38.679
<i>And Peter thinks he's smarter than me.</i>

19:39.054 --> 19:40.430
Well, you can't both be right.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.266
Which has resulted in years of debate.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.767
Now, one for one, truth for truth.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.143
Tell me what happened in Caracas.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.026
May 21st, 2009.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.446
An opera at the Teatro Teresa Carreño.

19:56.530 --> 19:57.865
Tight security.

19:58.532 --> 20:00.367
I snuck in, removed a wire

20:00.450 --> 20:02.661
from the orchestra's piano,
and slipped it...

20:02.744 --> 20:06.748
Over the lead actor's neck
as the first act was ending.

20:06.957 --> 20:09.001
He owed a very large debt
to the city's mayor

20:09.084 --> 20:10.252
and refused to pay,

20:10.335 --> 20:13.672
so I left his body onstage
and his head on the mayor's doorstep.

20:14.006 --> 20:15.507
That's the short version.

20:15.591 --> 20:18.927
I left out the '54 Gullwing
and the bridge jump over the Guaire.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.309
It's nice to finally hear it
from the source.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.814
This is the address
of an R & D facility in midtown.

20:30.898 --> 20:34.026
I need what's in vault 23, compartment 3.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.029
The haul is tiny,
but its importance to me is not.

20:37.529 --> 20:38.697
And what is it?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.032
It's a thumb drive.

20:40.157 --> 20:42.618
I need it Friday morning,
9:00 a.m., period.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.204
I expect my compensation upon delivery.

20:46.496 --> 20:49.208
See, this R & D facility, it's not like
slipping into an opera house.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.834
It's incredibly secure.

20:51.335 --> 20:54.421
I mean, maybe we should bring
along some, I don't know,

20:54.505 --> 20:56.215
muscle in case you get into trouble.

20:57.049 --> 20:58.300
(GROANING)

20:58.383 --> 21:00.469
One thing I forgot
to tell you about Caracas.

21:00.886 --> 21:03.514
Someone got in my way as
I was leaving the opera house.

21:03.597 --> 21:06.475
So I snapped the tendon
in his middle finger.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.852
Tendons are elastic, like rubber bands.

21:09.353 --> 21:12.940
I later heard his doctor had to fish
for the severed end deep inside his elbow.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.025
That enough muscle for you?

21:16.401 --> 21:18.153
You'll have the drive by Friday morning.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.452
Not a bad story, huh?

21:25.744 --> 21:28.413
What's your professional opinion,
one thief to another?

21:30.165 --> 21:31.500
You're not a thief.

21:32.835 --> 21:34.878
Admit it, you still love me.

21:35.587 --> 21:37.631
I wouldn't call what we had love.

21:37.714 --> 21:39.091
I disagree.

21:39.925 --> 21:41.343
Neal...

21:41.927 --> 21:44.596
You and I belong together.

21:44.680 --> 21:49.810
Uh-huh. And how would that work exactly,
conjugal visits every third Thursday?

21:49.893 --> 21:51.103
(CHUCKLES)

21:51.186 --> 21:52.813
Circumstances change.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.191
Come on, four years ago,
would you have guessed

21:56.275 --> 21:57.651
that you'd be a snitch

21:57.734 --> 21:59.570
for the very people
that were hunting you down?

22:03.490 --> 22:05.450
That's it, Neal. We're done.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.623
So, you going after the diamond?

22:12.374 --> 22:13.750
Who says I don't already have it?

22:13.834 --> 22:15.002
I do.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.629
That little thing you just did
with your eyebrow, it's a tell.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.385
Maybe I'm working on it.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.847
Or maybe the diamond doesn't even exist.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.473
Oh, it exists.

22:30.017 --> 22:32.603
And you're getting close.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.356
What are you gonna do if you find it
with that thing on your ankle?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.524
What then?

22:39.860 --> 22:40.986
I don't know.

22:44.489 --> 22:48.243
But I do know that whatever happens next
sure as hell doesn't include you.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.247
Good-bye, Rebecca.

23:14.645 --> 23:16.980
I think you invented a new sport in there.

23:17.356 --> 23:18.899
Psychological judo.

23:19.942 --> 23:22.402
Well, they say throwing salt on the wound

23:22.486 --> 23:23.904
is the quickest way to heal.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.697
-I don't think they say that.
-You sure?

23:25.781 --> 23:27.616
Yeah, they say something about time.

23:27.699 --> 23:29.618
Well, time to move on.

23:29.701 --> 23:30.786
I plan to

23:31.161 --> 23:33.372
while she spends
the rest of her life in a cell.

23:35.165 --> 23:37.501
Hey, about me saying that
I'm smarter than you in there...

23:37.584 --> 23:39.211
Oh, I know you think you are.

23:39.294 --> 23:40.796
That's why I always catch you.

23:41.839 --> 23:43.090
Good work.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.716
The Caracas story did the trick.

23:44.883 --> 23:47.135
-Diana got the assignment?
-And then some.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.515
Caffrey.

23:54.393 --> 23:57.688
Looks like Worth is targeting
the offices of DCFI.

23:57.771 --> 23:59.815
It's a hedge fund run by Ian Dybek.

23:59.898 --> 24:03.402
Ivy League, Upper West Sider,
golfs at clubs that don't allow women.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.237
Dybek and Worth
managed the fund together.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.155
Hmm. Until they were investigated

24:07.239 --> 24:09.032
on suspicion of market manipulation.

24:09.116 --> 24:10.409
JONES: Yeah, a bunch of strange activity

24:10.492 --> 24:13.203
from the company's server caught
the attention of the S.E.C.

24:13.287 --> 24:15.622
It turns out Worth ran
the high-frequency trading division.

24:15.706 --> 24:18.500
The S.E.C. shook him down
but didn't get enough to press charges.

24:18.584 --> 24:20.085
But Dybek fired him anyway.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.588
I think he needed a sacrificial lamb.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.382
I let Ian Dybek know

24:25.465 --> 24:28.010
that there's a security threat
on his facility.

24:28.093 --> 24:29.178
He want protection?

24:29.261 --> 24:32.806
No, he thanked me, then proceeded
to bolt out of the building.

24:33.515 --> 24:36.310
It looks like he tucked
something small in his pocket.

24:37.019 --> 24:39.479
Looks like a thumb drive.
Where was he headed?

24:39.563 --> 24:41.315
PETER: Home. I bet he had a reason.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.901
Like hiding the drive from the FBI.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.322
Firms like DCFI pay a fortune
for their trading algorithms.

24:48.405 --> 24:52.451
Yeah, a millisecond means the difference
between gaining and losing millions.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.077
If there's an algorithm on that drive,

24:54.161 --> 24:55.746
it makes sense that Worth
would want to steal it.

24:55.829 --> 24:57.164
But not why Dybek hid it.

24:57.247 --> 24:59.166
It's not illegal to use an algorithm.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.336
Unless it is.

That's a 1,000-point dead drop,

25:07.090 --> 25:09.176
all because one fund moved
a large amount of stock

25:09.259 --> 25:11.970
-when the market was vulnerable.
<i>-Indeed, the broader market...</i>

25:12.054 --> 25:15.349
It started a chain reaction
by high-frequency trading servers,

25:15.432 --> 25:17.142
which caused the market
to crash in seconds.

25:17.559 --> 25:19.144
Like high-stakes <i>Jenga.</i>

25:19.228 --> 25:22.397
Yep, but it's more like
throwing a banana peel.

25:22.481 --> 25:24.358
You're saying that
what tipped off the S.E.C.

25:24.441 --> 25:27.027
might have been Worth and Dybek
testing their algorithm

25:27.110 --> 25:29.530
to see how many ones and zeroes
they could make slip and fall.

25:29.613 --> 25:30.948
There are billions to be made.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.283
Sell short before the market dives.

25:33.367 --> 25:35.035
Be first in line when it bounces back up.

25:35.285 --> 25:38.163
The perfect crime, executed by computers.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.374
And Worth knows
if he steals the algorithm,

25:40.457 --> 25:43.710
Dybek can't report the theft
without implicating himself.

25:43.794 --> 25:46.588
If we're right, the only way to stop it
is to get that drive.

25:46.964 --> 25:48.048
We'll need a warrant.

25:48.131 --> 25:50.884
That takes time.
Worth wants the drive by Friday.

25:50.968 --> 25:52.427
What happens Friday?

25:52.511 --> 25:54.638
Uh, the new Woody Allen comes out.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.057
So does the jobs report.

25:57.307 --> 25:59.059
That means the market
is primed to be volatile.

25:59.309 --> 26:01.436
Jones, reach out to friendly
judges for that warrant.

26:01.520 --> 26:02.896
-Yep.
-I've got a briefing

26:02.980 --> 26:04.857

-Take Neal.
-I have one child.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.375
-Do you remember when we first moved in?
-Mmm-hmm.

26:23.584 --> 26:25.752
We ate off a crate for three months.

for the Georgetown house.

26:34.970 --> 26:36.180
Yeah.

26:36.263 --> 26:37.848
Yeah, we just have a lot of memories here.

26:37.931 --> 26:38.932
Mmm-hmm.

26:39.766 --> 26:41.101
We'll make some new ones.

26:42.603 --> 26:43.770
I know.

26:45.105 --> 26:46.148
Mmm.

26:46.231 --> 26:48.817
Does that have something to do
with opening a can?

26:49.193 --> 26:52.446
Mmm, no, I think it has something to do
with pitting a mango.

26:53.280 --> 26:54.573
Never used it.

26:54.698 --> 26:56.617
(CHUCKLES) Do you think Neal
would want it?

26:57.075 --> 26:58.285
I don't know,

26:58.368 --> 27:01.330
but I do know that he doesn't
want a handler anymore.

27:02.331 --> 27:06.210
Neal asked me to recommend
that his sentence be terminated.

27:06.293 --> 27:07.461
-Really?
-Yeah.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.545

-Hmm.

27:13.634 --> 27:14.676
Or not.

27:15.052 --> 27:17.804
I don't know. Maybe Neal's changed.

27:18.305 --> 27:21.016
We have been known
to be a positive influence before.

27:21.225 --> 27:24.520
Yeah, but Rebecca not only conned him.

27:24.603 --> 27:25.938
She broke his heart.

27:27.105 --> 27:30.234
What Neal needs right now are rules,
structure.

27:31.151 --> 27:34.655
Or what he needs is to figure out
what he wants in his life.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.033
I don't know.
Maybe this was a wake-up call for Neal.

27:52.464 --> 27:54.383

-You're handling me.

Ugh, that sounds all kinds of wrong.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.540
Well, so does this plan.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.250

Worst case, he doesn't.

36:37.447 --> 36:39.324
Is that what's supposed to happen?

36:39.408 --> 36:42.619
It's a little difficult
to explain to someone like you.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.580
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)

36:47.958 --> 36:49.960
I could explain it to you.

36:50.377 --> 36:52.754
Keep it simple so I understand.

36:54.298 --> 36:55.757
I just made a killing.

36:56.884 --> 36:58.010
Your turn.

36:58.844 --> 36:59.970
Explain that.

37:07.603 --> 37:08.854
Or I could tell you

37:08.937 --> 37:11.231
what happened to the last guy
who pointed a gun at me.

37:11.315 --> 37:13.108
-Her cover's blown.
-Let's move.

37:13.942 --> 37:15.068
Who the hell are you?

37:15.485 --> 37:16.820
I'm Rebecca Lowe.

37:17.529 --> 37:18.697
Who referred me?

37:19.031 --> 37:22.242
-An associate from Zurich.
-I'm not a fed.

37:22.326 --> 37:24.119
Yeah, that's not a bet
that I care to hedge.

37:24.244 --> 37:25.287
Do you really think the government

37:25.370 --> 37:27.664
would let millions of people
lose billions of dollars

37:27.748 --> 37:28.999
to sting one man?

37:29.249 --> 37:30.375
You're not that special.

37:30.459 --> 37:32.794
Now give me my money. We're done.

37:43.639 --> 37:45.265
Have you ever held a gun before?

37:47.059 --> 37:48.352
FBI.

37:48.894 --> 37:50.354
You're under arrest.

37:50.938 --> 37:52.272
Hands behind your back.

37:52.564 --> 37:53.607
Now!

37:58.362 --> 37:59.571
You okay?

38:01.698 --> 38:02.950
Of course you are.

38:03.534 --> 38:04.868
Let's go.

38:07.538 --> 38:08.956
Who the hell sent that text?

38:16.964 --> 38:18.131
What do we have?

38:18.215 --> 38:20.300
Tracing the SIM card
from Worth's phone now.

38:20.676 --> 38:23.220
Peter, you won't believe where
that text message came from.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.596
Where?

38:24.888 --> 38:27.641
-The Metropolitan Corrections Center.
-Rebecca.

38:36.942 --> 38:39.111
Warden Maxwell,
how the hell did she gain access

38:39.194 --> 38:40.362
to a cell phone?

38:40.445 --> 38:42.906
One of my best agents
was put in harm's way.

38:43.448 --> 38:46.159
You and me, we're gonna get
to the bottom of this.

38:46.702 --> 38:49.413
Peter, cell phones are currency in prison.
It happens.

38:49.496 --> 38:51.123
Not with cop killers it doesn't.

38:52.082 --> 38:53.917
-If anything had...
-Well, it didn't.

38:54.001 --> 38:55.502
We're not going there.

39:00.549 --> 39:02.092
What do you say we both go home?

39:07.181 --> 39:11.685
See, they want you to think
the <i>Apollo</i> landed on the moon.

39:11.768 --> 39:13.103
What they don't want you to know

39:13.187 --> 39:17.566
is that the "spaceship" landed
in our own backyard six times.

39:18.317 --> 39:19.693
(GURGLING)

39:22.821 --> 39:24.239
Come on.

39:24.948 --> 39:27.784
What's more interesting
than a good lunar con?

39:40.631 --> 39:43.634
Kid, you're kidding me!

39:46.220 --> 39:47.471
Of course.

39:47.554 --> 39:51.225
Every symbol could represent a number.

39:51.767 --> 39:54.269
Mosconi's symbols aren't a message.

39:54.770 --> 39:56.230
They're numbers.

39:57.272 --> 39:59.775
Numbers we understand.

40:00.609 --> 40:01.985
Numbers we can work with.

40:02.069 --> 40:04.279
Don't let anyone tell you
you'll never use math.

40:05.113 --> 40:06.365
Wow.

40:06.823 --> 40:08.492
You're really good with babies.

40:08.575 --> 40:09.993
Oh. Hairline.

40:10.911 --> 40:12.621
And your timing is impeccable.

40:18.460 --> 40:20.671
PETER: We have Dybek in custody.

40:20.754 --> 40:23.173
And just like any criminal,
he lawyered up.

40:24.258 --> 40:26.134
I wouldn't expect any less.

40:31.181 --> 40:35.853
All these times, I not only allowed
but encouraged you to break the rules...

40:35.978 --> 40:37.229
Hell, the law.

40:37.312 --> 40:38.730
It was never lost on me

40:38.814 --> 40:41.316
that the actions I took
were sanctioned by the FBI.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.944
I was focused on closing cases.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.737
And I let you scratch an itch.

40:45.821 --> 40:47.990
I have a great dermatologist.

40:49.116 --> 40:50.701
Actions define us.

40:51.285 --> 40:52.786
I made sure yours did.

40:54.162 --> 40:56.623
Got one question for you, just one.

40:57.958 --> 40:59.293
Shoot.

41:00.419 --> 41:02.212
Do you think you can go straight?

41:05.007 --> 41:06.300
Yes.

41:06.550 --> 41:09.428
Peter, I've never lied to you.

41:09.511 --> 41:12.389
Neal, you've double-talked,
omitted and bent the truth.

41:12.472 --> 41:14.892
One word. No loopholes.

41:16.643 --> 41:17.686
Yes.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.062
(SIGHS)

41:19.146 --> 41:20.772
I want to believe it.

41:20.856 --> 41:23.108
But after all you've done,
I'm not sure I can.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.695
If you can't...

41:28.864 --> 41:30.657
I'll have to do it on my own.

41:51.386 --> 41:52.596
What?

Peter, what is it?

Seriously?

Neal, where are you?

It's 4:00 a.m.
I've been calling all night.

42:11.949 --> 42:13.534
I have glorious news.

42:14.076 --> 42:16.495
Thanks to baby Teddy, I'll explain later,

42:16.578 --> 42:20.040
we know that Mosconi's
last clues were numbers.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.042
Numbers that, by the time you get home,

42:22.125 --> 42:24.086
will lead us to the diamond.
