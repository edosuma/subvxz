00:00.109 --> 00:01.370
<i>Previously, on</i>
"SEAL Team"...

00:01.960 --> 00:02.961
- Hey, Dad.
- Whoa!

00:03.046 --> 00:04.336
Emma,
what are you doing home?

00:04.421 --> 00:05.938
I-I told you I was
coming down.

00:06.023 --> 00:07.235
NATALIE:
You can't keep

00:07.320 --> 00:09.055
all these worlds
separate forever.

00:09.140 --> 00:10.758
Like I said,
my world is messy.

00:10.843 --> 00:12.259
REBECCA:
Well, we have a long way to go

00:12.343 --> 00:15.195
before we can give John and
Jackie a run for their money.

00:15.335 --> 00:17.000
The key to my place
is a start.

00:17.085 --> 00:18.656
Why did I agree
to any of this?

00:18.741 --> 00:21.219
My team and the hostages
you are treating

00:21.304 --> 00:22.711
are in serious danger.

00:22.796 --> 00:23.805
They need you.

00:23.890 --> 00:25.142
Had us in the dark
there, Master Chief.

00:25.226 --> 00:26.826
Yeah, well, dark is where
this op should stay.

00:26.910 --> 00:27.827
Where's Dr. Craig?

00:27.911 --> 00:29.562
Total mission failure.

00:29.647 --> 00:32.219
We all support the idea
Ray threw the offensive grenade

00:32.304 --> 00:33.322
in the room
with the hostages.

00:33.406 --> 00:35.142
DAVIS: It appears as though
someone threw something

00:35.226 --> 00:38.055
from the outside, into the room
where Dr. Craig was held.

00:38.155 --> 00:39.656
You were gonna
let Ray hang.

00:39.741 --> 00:41.007
Coward! Come here!

00:41.092 --> 00:42.266
JASON:
All my times on the teams,

00:42.350 --> 00:43.791
I've never seen anything
like this, Vic.

00:43.875 --> 00:44.937
Get out.

00:48.775 --> 00:50.812
ERIC: After the brutal
op-tempo in Caracas,

00:50.914 --> 00:53.050
I told Jace I'd give
you guys a chance to

00:53.134 --> 00:54.296
slow down, take a breath.

00:54.381 --> 00:56.634
JASON: Yeah, and I told Blackburn
Bravo Team doesn't slow down.

00:56.718 --> 00:57.945
Best way to clear our heads

00:58.030 --> 00:59.000
is to speed up.

00:59.085 --> 01:00.100
Isn't that right, boys?

01:00.185 --> 01:01.851
[whoops]

01:05.929 --> 01:07.005
Yeah!

01:07.112 --> 01:10.466
Daytona 500 champ Austin Dillon
has generously offered

01:10.638 --> 01:13.053
to give Bravo
some driving lessons. You're kidding me.

01:13.138 --> 01:14.680
Austin Dillon?
The Ace?

01:14.764 --> 01:15.951
- The one and only.
- It's okay, Sonny.

01:16.035 --> 01:18.183
You can put that tongue of yours
back in your mouth, man.

01:18.267 --> 01:20.177
- Come on, man.
- RAY: That's the perks of being DEVGRU.

01:20.261 --> 01:21.774
The best in the world want
to train with the best, right?

01:21.858 --> 01:24.019
Tell you what, a little
friendly competition.

01:24.214 --> 01:25.430
Rubbing's racing.

01:26.268 --> 01:27.394
[whoops]

01:27.479 --> 01:29.542
SONNY:
Looking good.Nice.

01:34.877 --> 01:37.448
Dude, hell yes.
Wow.

01:37.585 --> 01:39.981
Yeah, the smell
of freedom right there.

01:40.268 --> 01:42.758
- Hey, fellas, I'm Austin.
- Yeah, Sonny Quinn.

01:42.843 --> 01:44.571
Real pleasure to meet you, man.
Big fan of yours.

01:44.655 --> 01:46.697
Yeah, I actually saw you race
at Texas Motor Speedway

01:46.781 --> 01:47.539
a couple years back.

01:47.623 --> 01:50.020
- Dude, Texas is awesome, isn't it?
- Yeah. Hook 'em, baby!

01:50.104 --> 01:52.204
He's as smart as he is fast.
[laughs]

01:52.289 --> 01:54.028
Well, guys, this is a race car.

01:54.113 --> 01:56.003
And I want to show you a few
tips on how to drive it, man.

01:56.087 --> 01:57.233
Let's do it.

02:00.318 --> 02:02.293
Go ahead, open it up
a little bit, Ray.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.945
Accelerate into the corner
and catch the apex.

02:08.136 --> 02:09.988
- [laughing]
- All right, fellas,

02:10.073 --> 02:11.543
tires are always important.

02:11.628 --> 02:13.277
That's the only thing
touching the ground.

02:13.362 --> 02:15.105
So you want to take care
of your tires when you can,

02:15.189 --> 02:17.020
because you'll be able
to run faster longer.

02:17.801 --> 02:19.113
[whoops]

02:21.629 --> 02:23.358
AUSTIN: I know you're
gonna run close together.

02:23.442 --> 02:25.186
If you put air
on somebody's rear quarter,

02:25.270 --> 02:26.403
it's gonna make 'em loose.

02:27.185 --> 02:28.186
[tires screeching]

02:32.102 --> 02:33.748
AUSTIN:
Nice recovery, buddy. You okay?

02:33.840 --> 02:35.320
Yeah, all good.

02:39.675 --> 02:41.559
<i>Ease up a little bit
there, Jason.</i>

02:42.731 --> 02:44.379
Yeah, his comms get
a little spotty

02:44.463 --> 02:45.728
when he doesn't like
what you're saying.

02:45.812 --> 02:47.121
AUSTIN: Couple more laps,
then bring it in.

02:47.205 --> 02:49.732
Pit, who's got the fastest
lap of the day?

02:49.816 --> 02:51.864
That'd be Sonny with a 45 flat.

02:51.948 --> 02:55.332
Watch and learn, Sonny Boy.
Watch and learn.

03:19.111 --> 03:20.348
42.7.

03:20.583 --> 03:23.151
42.7, Jason.
Checkered flag's yours.

Ah, I bet you're thinking that
this is Austin Dillon, but...

03:50.328 --> 03:51.156
it's me.

03:51.241 --> 03:52.702
What'd you bring
in here with you?

03:52.787 --> 03:55.681
Is that... fossil fuel
I'm smelling, or booze?

03:55.766 --> 03:57.278
Little bit of both.

03:57.362 --> 04:01.297
You know, doing 205 in a 65,
didn't get caught. Bam!

04:01.382 --> 04:02.865
Hit the reset button.

04:03.134 --> 04:04.939
Are you checking the range
on that reset button?

04:05.023 --> 04:06.633
- See if it worked on us, too?
- No.

04:06.718 --> 04:09.016
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I just, uh...

04:10.055 --> 04:11.570
I was driving back
from the track,

04:11.655 --> 04:13.336
wind was whipping
through my hair.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.860
I had this revelation
that, you know what,

04:17.235 --> 04:18.298
whole thing
with Emma and you,

04:18.382 --> 04:19.690
I handled that wrong.

04:19.774 --> 04:22.651
Yeah. It didn't have
to be worlds colliding.

04:22.735 --> 04:23.652
Yeah, I know.

04:23.736 --> 04:25.523
[exhales]
I know.

04:25.607 --> 04:27.899
Hey, I understand the impulse

04:27.984 --> 04:30.485
to want to keep parts
of your life separate.

04:30.570 --> 04:34.444
I did more then my share
of that with Luke. Luke.

04:34.734 --> 04:36.601
The Lukester, right?
The ex-husband?

04:36.686 --> 04:38.795
Yeah. Bring him up
every now and then,

04:38.880 --> 04:41.016
your eyes roll into
the back of your head.

04:41.147 --> 04:42.140
What about him?

04:42.225 --> 04:43.818
There are things I learned
from my marriage,

04:43.902 --> 04:46.515
broken as it was, that
made me who I am today.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.702
We're all shaped
by our pasts.

04:50.226 --> 04:51.708
Right. So I'll tell you what.

04:51.793 --> 04:55.265
Mikey and Emma are coming back
next month before deployment.

04:55.350 --> 04:56.659
We could all get together.

04:56.744 --> 04:58.096
We could, you know,
have some fun,

04:58.181 --> 05:00.186
go get some churros...

05:00.422 --> 05:02.558
Uh, I was talking
about the past,

05:02.643 --> 05:04.952
and you just jumped
right to the future.

05:05.037 --> 05:08.043
That, sir, is some
masterful avoidance.

05:08.128 --> 05:09.351
What do you want me to say?

05:09.475 --> 05:10.698
I don't know
what you want me to say.

05:10.782 --> 05:14.952
Right.
Ight. So we're moving on.

05:15.435 --> 05:17.773
But I, uh...

05:18.445 --> 05:20.317
[making race car sounds]

05:20.796 --> 05:22.319
Next month.

05:22.678 --> 05:24.148
- Thank you.
- WOMAN: <i>Bye.</i>

05:24.233 --> 05:25.921
You got to admit
that was weird, right?

05:26.006 --> 05:26.991
- How so?
- [thunder rumbling]

05:27.076 --> 05:29.585
I don't know.
You haven't been here in six months,

05:29.670 --> 05:31.980
and the barista starts
making our usuals

05:32.065 --> 05:34.304
the second we walk in the door,
like nothing's changed.

05:35.046 --> 05:36.405
And everything has.

05:38.366 --> 05:39.632
Yeah, that's weird.

05:44.574 --> 05:46.110
I'm glad we could
finally do this.

05:47.330 --> 05:49.440
So, how you been?
Uh, good.

05:49.565 --> 05:51.827
- You know, work's work.
- Team's doing good.

05:51.911 --> 05:54.395
Illuminating, as always.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.223
[chuckles]
How's your, uh...

05:57.582 --> 06:00.095
your visiting lecturer
thing going?

06:00.416 --> 06:01.725
It's good.

06:01.810 --> 06:03.186
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.178
I am, um, hoping that
Old Dominion offers me

06:06.263 --> 06:08.771
- a long-term position.
- Long term?

06:09.505 --> 06:10.802
Mm-hmm.

06:11.255 --> 06:13.505
Leaving Virginia
was a mistake.

06:14.591 --> 06:17.474
You know, I've been, um...
I've been seeing someone.

06:18.286 --> 06:20.053
I just thought
you should know that.

06:20.919 --> 06:22.490
Okay.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.632
That's great.

06:26.583 --> 06:27.655
Is it?

06:27.740 --> 06:29.404
Yeah, I mean, I moved...

06:29.677 --> 06:31.224
You moved on.

06:32.599 --> 06:34.826
I didn't expect you
to hold out for me.

06:36.237 --> 06:37.438
So, how did you meet?

06:38.081 --> 06:39.614
You don't want to hear
about all that.

06:40.128 --> 06:43.444
Mm, I do. I do
actually want to know.

06:43.551 --> 06:45.702
Just 'cause we're
not together doesn't mean

06:45.819 --> 06:47.328
I don't want to know
what's going on with you.

06:47.412 --> 06:50.506
It's kind of how that whole
"being friends" thing works.

06:52.552 --> 06:54.554
[gunshots]

07:03.725 --> 07:04.826
Ensign Davis.

07:06.162 --> 07:08.343
What brings you down from
your ivory cake-eating tower?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.645
Trying to get back
to my enlisted sailor roots.

07:10.729 --> 07:12.032
I've been doing
a lot more paper-pushing

07:12.116 --> 07:13.999
than weapons training recently.

07:14.084 --> 07:15.304
Yeah, well,

07:15.389 --> 07:17.991
sunrise yoga's got nothing
on a 100-round wake-up.

07:18.272 --> 07:19.262
Guarantee you leave
feeling better

07:19.346 --> 07:20.350
than when you came in.

07:20.434 --> 07:22.522
That'd be good.
I'm a little rusty.

07:22.846 --> 07:24.468
- Got any tips?
- Just one.

07:24.569 --> 07:25.964
Rounds downrange
are downrange.

07:26.155 --> 07:27.788
Last shot didn't go
the way you want,

07:27.873 --> 07:29.820
don't let it impact
your next one.

07:29.905 --> 07:31.843
- Copy.
- Easier said than done.

07:31.928 --> 07:33.092
Truth be told,

07:33.694 --> 07:35.974
I've been a little off
since that last op.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.100
Well, Caracas was hard
for everybody.

07:41.548 --> 07:43.158
Hey, I'm sorry about Vic.

07:43.936 --> 07:45.296
I'm sorry you got
put through that.

07:47.170 --> 07:48.639
Hey, I'm still standing.

07:48.873 --> 07:51.296
I'm better than standing,
I'm moving forward.

07:51.381 --> 07:54.264
When's your next, uh, warrant
officer board interview?

07:54.530 --> 07:56.035
In a week.

08:00.343 --> 08:03.889
I have to admit I felt better
about it the first time.

08:04.390 --> 08:06.694
But after the
Venezuela op, Vic...

08:07.842 --> 08:09.632
I feel like I shuffled
the deck a little bit.

08:09.717 --> 08:11.018
Well, you did everything
right down there.

08:11.102 --> 08:12.609
None of this is on you.

08:13.540 --> 08:16.115
Hey, what'd you say?

08:17.381 --> 08:18.935
Rounds downrange...

08:21.809 --> 08:23.593
Downrange.

08:25.569 --> 08:26.818
Not bad.

08:30.008 --> 08:31.186
[knocks gently]

08:31.857 --> 08:33.982
Spenser, come on in.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.116
This situation with
Petty Officer Lopez

08:37.201 --> 08:39.864
- is... unfortunate.
- Yes, sir.

08:39.948 --> 08:41.659
Though we were fortunate
that Vic was exposed

08:41.744 --> 08:43.763
before causing any
real damage to Bravo.

08:46.141 --> 08:48.208
It's got to be especially
frustrating for you.

08:48.309 --> 08:49.831
Earning some seniority
on the team,

08:49.915 --> 08:51.920
then suddenly you're back
being low man.

08:52.138 --> 08:53.990
I like to think I have
an impact on the team,

08:54.075 --> 08:55.184
regardless of my position.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.333
Well, it seems you still
want to have an impact

08:57.481 --> 08:59.222
away from Bravo.

09:02.101 --> 09:03.772
Look, sir, what,
uh, what happened

09:03.857 --> 09:05.185
with Congressman Suzuki...

09:05.270 --> 09:07.225
It's fine, Spenser.
I didn't bring you in here

09:07.340 --> 09:08.543
to ream you.
Have a seat.

09:11.589 --> 09:14.246
Look, I want to help you
to harness

09:14.330 --> 09:15.987
your energy and your ambition

09:16.278 --> 09:17.641
to allow you to do more.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.833
Isn't that what
you're looking for?

09:20.349 --> 09:22.338
Uh...

09:23.788 --> 09:26.146
You stood me down
months ago.

09:27.216 --> 09:28.870
So why are you taking
an interest in me now?

09:28.954 --> 09:31.763
Jason Hayes, Ash Spenser.

09:31.848 --> 09:34.560
You think they cast
big shadows? [chuckles]

09:34.954 --> 09:37.699
You should have met
my old man, the admiral.

09:37.815 --> 09:40.881
Any success I enjoyed,
that was because of him.

09:40.966 --> 09:43.841
My failures proved I'd
never be as good as him.

09:44.325 --> 09:46.833
Just took me a long time
to find my own path.

09:46.997 --> 09:49.146
Maybe I can help shed
some light on yours.

09:49.231 --> 09:51.587
No, you... you don't have
to do that, sir.

09:51.672 --> 09:54.286
Well, my job is to deploy
every resource

09:54.370 --> 09:55.940
to its greatest effect.

09:56.024 --> 09:59.155
And you, Clay, you could be one
hell of a resource for the Navy.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.864
It just all depends
on what you want.

10:02.915 --> 10:05.513
Gentlemen, we'll be
departing today

10:05.598 --> 10:08.865
for our foreign internal
defense training exercises.

10:08.950 --> 10:10.781
Five days in Turkmenistan.

10:10.865 --> 10:13.903
SONNY:
Is that on Tatooine? No, it's not.

10:14.260 --> 10:15.917
Turkmenistan is cozy
with the Russians

10:16.001 --> 10:17.571
and is led by a madman.

10:17.661 --> 10:19.630
And I'm not sure why
we want to go there

10:19.715 --> 10:20.680
and share our tactics with them.

10:20.765 --> 10:22.357
Teaching tomorrow's enemies
today.

10:22.442 --> 10:24.280
Which is why we're not gonna
show 'em all of our tricks.

10:24.364 --> 10:25.317
CQB only.

10:25.401 --> 10:27.929
Offering to guide their
burgeoning spec ops program

10:28.013 --> 10:29.974
will score the U.S. points
with a potential ally

10:30.058 --> 10:31.323
in a hostile region.

10:31.407 --> 10:33.794
And Mr. Spenser here
has graciously volunteered

10:33.879 --> 10:35.358
to tell us all about that.

10:35.443 --> 10:37.216
- Has he not?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:37.301 --> 10:39.466
- RAY: Yeah, yeah...
- Got voluntold, actually.

10:39.551 --> 10:41.853
Drumroll, please.
Drumroll.

10:45.498 --> 10:48.066
[imitating Eric]:
All right, everybody, listen up.[laughter]

10:49.077 --> 10:49.994
That's not even close.

10:50.078 --> 10:51.561
Base we're gonna be living

10:51.669 --> 10:53.650
and training in is in the
city of Turkmenbashi.

10:53.734 --> 10:56.631
SONNY: Bashi.
- Area's geopolitically stable,

10:56.716 --> 10:58.598
although not without tension.

10:58.905 --> 11:01.614
- All right, get to good stuff there.
- Get to the good stuff.

11:01.699 --> 11:04.182
Where is our local
drinking establishment?

11:04.266 --> 11:06.122
How close and how clothed?

11:06.207 --> 11:07.951
[door opens]

11:09.105 --> 11:11.301
Whoa, why don't we
table that till later?

11:11.404 --> 11:13.017
Agent Ellis.
Good to see you.

11:13.101 --> 11:14.216
CLAY:
Agency show up to put

11:14.301 --> 11:15.367
a little curve on the ball
or what?

11:15.451 --> 11:17.239
RAY: Or tell us why Bravo's
doing a training op

11:17.323 --> 11:18.806
more fit for white-side SEALs?

11:18.890 --> 11:21.069
Team 2 or 4
couldn't do this?

11:21.153 --> 11:22.645
MANDY:
Syed Latif.

11:22.762 --> 11:24.599
One of the most gifted engineers

11:24.684 --> 11:26.552
of Pakistan's weapons program.

11:26.636 --> 11:29.120
Until he went missing
two days ago.

11:29.204 --> 11:31.223
DAVIS: Intel says he's
abducted by operatives

11:31.308 --> 11:33.466
working with the
Turkmen intel agency.

11:33.551 --> 11:35.927
It's believed they'll be
transporting him to Turkmenistan

11:36.012 --> 11:39.325
and forcing him to work on their
nuclear weapons technology.

11:39.429 --> 11:42.610
Sources indicate he'll be held
in a safe house temporarily,

11:42.695 --> 11:44.613
20 kilometers
from your base.

11:44.698 --> 11:47.530
Uh, use our training visit
as a cover to snatch him?

11:47.754 --> 11:49.193
That's the idea.

11:49.278 --> 11:50.674
Trojan Horse.- [chuckles]

11:50.759 --> 11:52.677
Beware of frogmen bearing gifts.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.451
DAVIS:
Latif is a gold mine

11:54.536 --> 11:56.104
of foreign weapons knowledge
that we can tap.

11:56.188 --> 11:58.584
Plus, we'll keep the Turkmen
from advancing their program.

11:58.668 --> 12:01.185
Yeah. We will be
under constant watch

12:01.270 --> 12:02.794
by Turkmen command
on the base.

12:02.879 --> 12:04.489
Doing anything without
their knowledge,

12:04.574 --> 12:06.535
let alone an
HVT capture op,

12:06.620 --> 12:08.320
will be tremendously dangerous.

12:08.459 --> 12:10.551
Yeah, but it's a hell of a lot
more fun than running drills.

12:10.635 --> 12:13.333
[agreeing chatter]

12:15.849 --> 12:17.294
Here's a picture of
the safe house.

12:17.379 --> 12:19.154
The HVT, Latif,
will be arriving in

12:19.239 --> 12:21.225
Turkmenbashi
on the last day of your visit.

12:21.310 --> 12:23.287
Any heightened security measures
we need to know about?

12:23.371 --> 12:24.325
None that
I'm aware of.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.552
MANDY: His captors
most likely think

12:25.636 --> 12:27.232
that getting him out of
Pakistan was the hard part.

12:27.316 --> 12:29.637
- How many guns protecting him?
- Estimate three to four.

12:29.729 --> 12:31.920
Yeah, we can only send in
a four-man assault team.

12:32.005 --> 12:33.233
The rest of the unit
will have to maintain

12:33.317 --> 12:35.130
a presence at the
base for cover.

12:35.215 --> 12:37.216
Hmm. This hit seems
pretty straightforward.

12:37.301 --> 12:38.437
JASON:
Straightforward. Right.

12:38.521 --> 12:40.101
We'll be on the base
without any of our guns,

12:40.185 --> 12:43.931
vehicles or
method to sneak out undetected.

12:44.015 --> 12:46.543
Agency's pinning down weapons
and transport as we speak.

12:46.627 --> 12:48.403
Yeah, and if our hosts
have any inkling

12:48.488 --> 12:50.189
that we've got an agenda
besides training,

12:50.274 --> 12:52.098
the blowback
will be disastrous.

12:53.029 --> 12:55.278
Well, we still got five days
to figure out the details.

12:55.363 --> 12:56.997
Wheels up in four hours.

13:04.854 --> 13:06.377
[knocking on door]

13:11.474 --> 13:13.451
STELLA: So, I thought that
I could drive home

13:13.536 --> 13:14.904
and-and just let it go.

13:14.989 --> 13:16.497
And allow you
to move on.

13:16.598 --> 13:17.685
- What are you doing?
- [exhales]

13:17.769 --> 13:19.687
I did not come back
to Virginia for work.

13:19.772 --> 13:22.161
I didn't. I came
back for you.

13:22.403 --> 13:23.897
Why would it be
any different this time?

13:23.981 --> 13:25.408
I don't want it
to be different.

13:25.683 --> 13:27.626
When we were together,
all that seemed to matter

13:27.711 --> 13:29.629
was what you did,
and when we were apart,

13:29.713 --> 13:31.333
I realized that it didn't.

13:31.418 --> 13:34.555
It didn't matter. All that
mattered was who you are.

13:35.012 --> 13:36.716
I still love you.

13:37.177 --> 13:38.616
I'm about to
board a flight.

13:38.895 --> 13:40.639
- I can't do this right now.
- Okay.

13:40.770 --> 13:43.176
I-I know that it's not fair
to complicate things.

13:43.276 --> 13:45.387
I just
needed to tell you.

13:46.934 --> 13:48.731
Please come home safe.

13:56.786 --> 13:58.387
ERIC:
Plane just finished refueling.

13:58.475 --> 14:00.801
- Six hours, fellas.
- SONNY: So you're telling me

14:00.885 --> 14:02.036
that she straight-up

14:02.121 --> 14:04.387
John Cusack, Say Anything'd
you on your doorstep?

14:04.472 --> 14:06.346
- Yeah. Pretty much.
- [laughs]

14:06.431 --> 14:09.466
Ooh-wee.
I told you she didn't

14:09.551 --> 14:11.730
fly across the country
just to be your buddy.

14:11.929 --> 14:13.512
No, no, no.

14:13.609 --> 14:15.345
So, uh, you figured out

14:15.430 --> 14:17.551
how you're gonna cut
this Rebecca girl loose?

14:19.807 --> 14:21.176
Hold on a
second here.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.181
You're not telling me
this is an actual decision.

14:23.356 --> 14:24.491
Oh, come on, man.

14:24.576 --> 14:26.256
Seriously? What about
all those months

14:26.341 --> 14:27.861
of you ruining a good tequila,

14:27.945 --> 14:30.560
crying over the fact that
the-the-the professor girl

14:30.644 --> 14:32.130
was the one?

14:32.215 --> 14:34.301
And now this shiny new
girl is more important?

14:34.386 --> 14:35.911
[chuckles]

14:36.161 --> 14:38.079
Why do you care?

14:38.164 --> 14:41.649
Well, Lindell called you in,
dangling opportunities.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.294
Yeah? Well, that's 'cause
he knew you'd bite.

14:44.445 --> 14:47.505
'Cause you're always looking
for what's next.

14:48.708 --> 14:49.771
[sighs]

14:49.856 --> 14:51.364
Can't nothing hold
your eyes for long,

14:51.481 --> 14:52.669
can it, Clay?
[sniffles]

14:52.754 --> 14:54.277
- I'm out.
- [knocking on table]

14:55.886 --> 14:57.145
RAY:
So, uh,

14:57.332 --> 14:58.770
got an e-mail earlier today.

14:58.873 --> 14:59.964
From Vic.

15:00.049 --> 15:01.739
The hell does he want?

15:02.403 --> 15:04.911
I don't know.
I haven't opened it yet.

15:05.692 --> 15:07.335
But it can't be good,
and I don't want it messing

15:07.419 --> 15:08.511
with my head on this trip.

15:08.603 --> 15:10.380
Don't open it.
Just delete it.

15:11.292 --> 15:13.210
It doesn't feel right
just erasing the thing.

15:13.365 --> 15:14.891
Why? What happened
happened.

15:15.723 --> 15:17.694
Why are you rehashing the past?

15:17.779 --> 15:19.013
There's always something
to be learned

15:19.097 --> 15:20.262
from the ugly moments, right?

15:20.347 --> 15:22.265
Exactly why they
call 'em ugly, Ray.

15:22.696 --> 15:24.841
That's why I get rid of 'em,
'cause they're ugly.

15:25.496 --> 15:27.513
I don't understand.
It's like...

15:27.614 --> 15:28.879
You sound like Natalie.
You know? It's just...

15:28.963 --> 15:30.834
just keep bringing up
things from the past.

15:31.341 --> 15:32.759
It's weighing on you, huh?

15:33.116 --> 15:34.723
She's talking
about her ex-husband.

15:35.895 --> 15:37.335
Have you talked to her
about Alana?

15:37.451 --> 15:40.520
- Why?
- How is going back

15:40.605 --> 15:42.356
helping us move forward?

15:43.136 --> 15:44.387
Doesn't work.

15:45.839 --> 15:47.614
- That's one way of looking at it.
- Mm-hmm.

16:04.999 --> 16:06.101
JASON:
Hello, boys.

16:06.186 --> 16:07.579
Master Chief Hayes.

16:11.353 --> 16:13.429
Uh, this is awkward.

16:14.470 --> 16:15.780
CLAY:
Middle school dance awkward.

16:15.864 --> 16:18.171
Well, we should maybe
teach them about hospitality.

16:18.256 --> 16:19.663
Have some refreshments
out first,

16:19.748 --> 16:21.187
maybe a plate of cruditÃ©s.

16:21.272 --> 16:22.494
ODEEV:
Welcome.

16:22.617 --> 16:25.265
Welcome. Master Chief Hayes.

16:25.458 --> 16:27.913
- Master Chief Odeev.
- RAY: I take it you're gonna be the one

16:27.998 --> 16:29.812
doing the translating
for the silent ones?

16:29.897 --> 16:32.398
Ah... all my men know
some English.

16:32.499 --> 16:35.687
Prenko here speaks it
like a poet. Uh, Prenko,

16:35.927 --> 16:37.453
give them the tour.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.218
You sleep there.

16:39.303 --> 16:41.046
- [soft laughter]
- ODEEV: He's good.

16:41.351 --> 16:43.234
My men are housed
right next door.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.218
If you need anything,
just shout.

16:45.303 --> 16:46.999
And if you need
to go anywhere in the base,

16:47.128 --> 16:48.437
we will gladly escort you.

16:48.572 --> 16:49.750
So we need chaperones?

16:49.835 --> 16:51.231
It is the policy.

16:51.781 --> 16:54.624
We're all very excited
to train with the best.

16:58.147 --> 17:00.898
All right. No privacy,

17:01.252 --> 17:02.835
mutual suspicion,

17:02.920 --> 17:04.403
and the smell of gunpowder.

17:04.747 --> 17:06.593
I feel like I'm back
home with my family.

17:06.890 --> 17:08.690
You sure we're gonna be able
to pull this off?

17:13.672 --> 17:15.436
Current workup
on the men believed

17:15.521 --> 17:17.522
to be transporting the HVT.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.986
We heard from our guys yet?

17:20.694 --> 17:22.035
ERIC: Yeah, Jason reached out.

17:22.118 --> 17:23.940
The encrypted cell you gave him
is working fine.

17:24.023 --> 17:25.800
DAVIS: All my intel
says Latif is still on track

17:25.885 --> 17:27.257
to arrive four
days from now.

17:27.422 --> 17:31.211
Our guys do their day jobs till
then, we'll keep 'em updated.

17:31.419 --> 17:33.203
Yeah.
[clears throat]

17:34.241 --> 17:36.768
Hey. The Trojan Horse
cleared the gate.

17:36.859 --> 17:37.982
So we're good.

17:38.067 --> 17:39.068
Yeah.

17:40.739 --> 17:42.203
RAY:
Four-man room entry.

17:42.288 --> 17:43.640
Bread and butter CQB.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.265
Same fundamentals as
the two-man, so let's review.

17:46.359 --> 17:47.477
Mr. Spenser.

17:47.562 --> 17:51.756
All right, so,
point man hooks in,

17:52.078 --> 17:54.759
posts up two feet from
the wall, clears the room.

17:55.038 --> 17:56.563
Second guy

17:56.648 --> 17:59.585
hooks in two feet from the wall,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.366
- scans the room.
- <i>Prenko</i> speaks Turkmen'

18:01.457 --> 18:04.663
[scoffs]
There a problem? Huh?

18:04.873 --> 18:06.095
ODEEV: Ah,
he's just telling them

18:06.179 --> 18:07.990
to, uh, focus.

18:08.631 --> 18:10.256
PRENKO:
What are you here for?

18:10.351 --> 18:11.516
Excuse me?

18:11.601 --> 18:14.211
Did you come all this way
to treat us like schoolchildren?

18:14.296 --> 18:16.360
Let's gear up,
do this for real.

18:16.445 --> 18:19.508
Uh, you crawl, walk,
then you run.

18:19.593 --> 18:21.469
All right? Taking it one
step at a time, buddy.

18:21.554 --> 18:23.186
You're wasting our time.

18:23.601 --> 18:25.123
We want to learn
high-speed assault,

18:25.208 --> 18:26.488
explosive breaching.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.602
ODEEV:
Prenko.

18:27.687 --> 18:28.922
Sem bol.

18:29.007 --> 18:31.361
You SEALs strut around
like cowboys.

18:31.531 --> 18:33.447
- Let's see you prove it.
- We don't need to prove

18:33.531 --> 18:36.515
a damn thing to you,
Soda Popinski.

18:36.717 --> 18:38.443
You don't think
we're good enough?

18:38.528 --> 18:39.867
Eh.

18:40.374 --> 18:42.632
PRENKO:
Our best against yours.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.313
Shooting contest.

18:44.398 --> 18:46.618
CLAY [laughs]:
That's hilarious.

18:46.703 --> 18:48.353
You might want to get your boy
in check here, buddy.

18:48.437 --> 18:50.196
We win, you teach us
the real stuff.

18:50.281 --> 18:51.577
Airplane
takedown tactics.

18:51.662 --> 18:53.413
How you took out
General Lionheart.

18:53.787 --> 18:55.703
If Bravo Team's
really the best,

18:55.788 --> 18:58.040
what's there to be scared of?

18:58.319 --> 19:00.408
Got to earn your shot
at the title.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.609
Six plates, 20 yards.

19:03.906 --> 19:05.090
Shoot the ends.

19:05.281 --> 19:07.180
You messed with the wrong bull,

19:07.265 --> 19:08.874
Popinski.

19:11.267 --> 19:12.706
Might be the dumbest idea
you've ever had.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.688
CLAY [laughs]:
And that's saying something.

19:14.773 --> 19:16.101
There was no way in hell

19:16.185 --> 19:18.103
I was gonna let them slander
Bravo's good name.

19:18.187 --> 19:20.486
Let's just hope you can shoot a
pistol better than you can drive.

19:20.570 --> 19:22.711
- Course I can.
- RAY: Best two out of three.

19:22.796 --> 19:24.718
Quickest time,
one shot per plate.

19:24.802 --> 19:26.781
SONNY:
Yeah. Roger that.

19:30.063 --> 19:31.937
Well done, Prenko.

19:32.593 --> 19:34.163
3.1.

19:34.528 --> 19:36.878
[panting]

19:44.153 --> 19:45.811
3.22.

19:45.896 --> 19:47.772
- [laughter]
- We got this.

19:47.857 --> 19:49.661
[whispers]:
Hey, Sonny.

19:49.825 --> 19:51.180
Sonny. Listen to me.

19:51.264 --> 19:53.138
You can't lose,
you understand me?

19:53.222 --> 19:55.029
We can't be teaching
unapproved tactics.

19:55.114 --> 19:56.295
They're gonna pull the plug

19:56.380 --> 19:58.143
on this training,
and our op's gonna be canked.

19:58.227 --> 19:59.929
There's more on the line than
your knuckleheaded pride, hoss.

20:00.013 --> 20:01.930
SONNY: Okay, well,
I happen to be using

20:02.014 --> 20:03.975
this little Russian peashooter
right now.

20:04.060 --> 20:05.624
- They have the home team advantage...
- Focus, focus.

20:05.708 --> 20:06.678
Now focus.

20:06.763 --> 20:08.435
Come on, man. I'm playing
a little rope-a-dope.

20:08.519 --> 20:10.260
[exhales sharply]Focus.

20:14.575 --> 20:16.015
[wolf whistle]2.8.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.364
MAN:
Nice.

20:25.907 --> 20:27.044
2.7.

20:27.129 --> 20:28.090
[grumbling]

20:28.191 --> 20:31.075
Okay. Final round.

20:32.435 --> 20:33.747
Final round.

20:41.414 --> 20:42.767
[whoops]

20:42.852 --> 20:44.335
CLAY:
Two flat.

20:44.420 --> 20:46.030
- JASON: Dial it in.
- ODEEV: Prenko.

21:01.685 --> 21:02.755
1.8!

21:02.840 --> 21:04.027
- [whooping]
- JASON: All right, boys.

21:04.111 --> 21:06.167
Let's go.
Party's over.

21:06.252 --> 21:08.083
- Let's go.
- ODEEV: Hey. Nice shooting.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.428
Nice shooting.

21:09.513 --> 21:11.388
You are the best.

21:11.546 --> 21:13.548
[vocalizing quietly]

21:15.794 --> 21:17.056
Uh...

21:20.341 --> 21:22.099
Corner of that building.

21:22.294 --> 21:23.968
Surveillance camera.

21:24.536 --> 21:27.474
Another group beyond
that flagpole, by gate two.

21:27.575 --> 21:29.975
Just as many eyes
on the other exit routes.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.927
Great Escape'snot gonna be as
easy to pull off as we thought.

21:38.419 --> 21:40.202
So, I read it.

21:41.232 --> 21:42.317
Vic's e-mail.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.311
I hope it said, "Thank you
very much for the opportunity."

21:45.396 --> 21:47.506
Said I'm a fraud. You got to be kidding me.

21:47.591 --> 21:49.770
And I'm all about
myself and my career.

21:49.854 --> 21:52.860
Uh, thinks I only acted like a
mentor to him to pad my rÃ©sumÃ©,

21:52.944 --> 21:56.037
and then when the wind
changed, I sold him out.

21:56.239 --> 21:58.021
Should've deleted it.
What did I tell you?

21:58.106 --> 21:59.328
Delete.

21:59.413 --> 22:00.958
Ignoring him
doesn't help, Jace.

22:01.043 --> 22:03.440
[scoffs]
Doesn't hurt, either.

22:03.912 --> 22:07.411
Gate three over there looks
to be our best bet for exit.

22:07.496 --> 22:09.632
Deliveries around the clock.

22:09.723 --> 22:11.989
Agency laundry truck
should be able to slip right in.

22:12.268 --> 22:15.114
We slip out of the barracks,
get on the laundry truck,

22:15.459 --> 22:18.378
hit the target, hitch a
ride back on that truck.

22:18.463 --> 22:19.859
Straight through that gate.

22:19.997 --> 22:21.505
- Boom.
- Boom.

22:23.555 --> 22:25.278
GUARD:
Stop.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.685
You're Americans.

22:28.770 --> 22:30.079
What are you doing
over here?

22:30.163 --> 22:31.734
You're supposed to be
supervised at all times.

22:31.818 --> 22:34.172
No, relax, brother. We're just
walking off the lamb Chegdermeh.

22:34.256 --> 22:35.391
That's it.
Yeah, we're heading back...

22:35.475 --> 22:37.069
- Give me your identification.
- Whoa-ho-ho.

22:37.153 --> 22:40.159
Hey, chief, simmer down.
Put that down.

22:40.244 --> 22:41.902
You're coming with me.
That's not gonna happen.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.083
You're making a big
mistake, friend.Big.

22:45.257 --> 22:47.107
Come on.

22:47.192 --> 22:48.318
Yeah.

22:50.934 --> 22:53.185
I'm reporting this
to my commander.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.833
May have just blown
this op, Ray.

23:08.044 --> 23:10.701
Jason reports a gate guard
spotted them doing recon,

23:10.786 --> 23:12.717
made some noise about
calling his commander.

23:12.802 --> 23:14.420
We can't afford
any more eyes on us.

23:14.505 --> 23:15.928
We may need to cancel
the Latif op.

23:16.013 --> 23:17.865
No. We can
monitor chatter,

23:17.950 --> 23:20.193
if there are suspicions being
raised in Turkmen command.

23:20.278 --> 23:22.214
There's no reason to alter
the mission plan yet.

23:22.299 --> 23:24.619
Maybe not, but if they're
in that guard's crosshairs,

23:24.704 --> 23:26.418
there's no way they're
sneaking out of his gate.

23:26.502 --> 23:27.714
Gate three is the only one

23:27.799 --> 23:29.619
that's taking
service deliveries.

23:29.748 --> 23:32.205
Okay, we'll find a way
to make gate three work.

23:32.915 --> 23:34.581
We have three days
to figure it out.

23:34.666 --> 23:36.879
[â™ª]

23:37.103 --> 23:39.245
CLAY: <i>And then,
as soon as you clear that,</i>

23:39.330 --> 23:41.506
<i>you're clearing the rest of it.</i>

23:43.643 --> 23:44.809
Right.

23:44.894 --> 23:46.792
You're coming through like this.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.423
<i>â™ª Better bite your tongue</i>

23:49.608 --> 23:51.799
<i>â™ª Before you cross the line...</i>

23:53.651 --> 23:56.088
CLAY:
Karagoz checks the whole truck.

23:56.987 --> 23:59.172
Captain Hadley's
taking a break.

23:59.853 --> 24:01.284
2200 hours.

24:01.369 --> 24:04.159
<i>â™ª Look me in the eye...</i>

24:04.314 --> 24:06.037
TRENT: His replacement
is less vigilant.

24:07.743 --> 24:09.704
<i>â™ª Then recognize</i>

24:09.788 --> 24:12.008
<i>â™ª I bring a whole lot
of trouble â™ª</i>

24:13.183 --> 24:15.536
<i>â™ª I bring a whole lot of pain</i>

24:15.620 --> 24:19.061
<i>â™ª If you ain't
got the heart... â™ª</i>

24:19.466 --> 24:22.034
Takes a second break
at midnight.

24:23.272 --> 24:25.345
<i>â™ª I'm a bad man...</i>

24:26.120 --> 24:27.808
GATE 2 GUARD:
<i>Odeev!</i>

24:27.893 --> 24:29.432
I'll, uh, catch up
with you guys.

24:29.517 --> 24:31.558
- Hey. What's up, brother?
- What's up, brother?

24:31.643 --> 24:33.682
[speaking indistinctly]

24:35.716 --> 24:37.460
[barking, growling]

24:37.583 --> 24:39.370
<i>â™ª Want to take me down?</i>

24:39.470 --> 24:40.692
[barking]

24:40.776 --> 24:43.303
[laughter]

24:43.387 --> 24:46.745
MAN:
We're gonna need a bigger dog.

24:46.999 --> 24:48.526
<i>â™ª Recognize</i>

24:48.610 --> 24:51.093
<i>â™ª This ain't your day</i>

24:51.177 --> 24:53.705
<i>â™ª Better swallow your pride...</i>

24:53.789 --> 24:55.446
- Way to go.
- [applause]

24:55.530 --> 24:57.099
Very good. Good.

24:57.183 --> 24:59.328
<i>â™ª Then recognize...</i>

24:59.578 --> 25:01.389
CLAY: Same schedule,
three nights in a row.

25:01.536 --> 25:02.670
10:00 to midnight.

25:02.754 --> 25:04.324
It's a tight window
for exit and RTB.

25:04.408 --> 25:05.586
FULL METAL:
Tomorrow night,

25:05.678 --> 25:06.913
it's on.

25:06.998 --> 25:08.696
<i>â™ª Ain't got the heart</i>

25:08.788 --> 25:10.477
<i>â™ª I'm a bad, bad man. â™ª</i>

25:10.659 --> 25:12.735
HVT's confirmed on site
at the target house?

25:12.820 --> 25:15.260
As of 20 minutes ago.
Escorted in by three men.

25:15.395 --> 25:18.532
ISR has launched from Shindand.
Be on station in an hour.

25:18.617 --> 25:21.144
Transport and weapons
are locked down.

25:21.229 --> 25:24.024
The laundry truck will be on
the base at 2200. We're ready.

25:24.109 --> 25:26.524
All right, so Mandy's guys
will cut power to the safe house

25:26.609 --> 25:28.000
immediately before
we do the hit.

25:28.126 --> 25:29.321
We'll go in with NODs.

25:29.406 --> 25:30.477
Who's on the assault team?

25:30.562 --> 25:32.132
Me, you, Trent,
Full Metal.

25:32.217 --> 25:33.657
We'll slip in
just before 10:00.

25:33.741 --> 25:35.493
Rest of us will stay behind
to maintain our cover.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.927
One hour till go time,
so stay sharp.

25:39.175 --> 25:41.063
The guests of honor!

25:41.183 --> 25:43.844
We celebrate our
wonderful new partnership.

25:43.929 --> 25:46.103
Ah, yes, my dear friends.

25:46.188 --> 25:48.703
You know, I really
appreciate that, but, uh,

25:48.788 --> 25:49.880
we have an early flight
in the morning.

25:49.964 --> 25:52.065
Boys, they got to sleep up,
get some rest.

25:52.150 --> 25:54.678
The tough Americans,
they need their beauty sleep.

25:54.762 --> 25:56.321
No chance.

25:56.406 --> 25:58.641
We send you off in style,
Master Chief. Come.

25:58.726 --> 26:00.051
[clears throat]

26:00.244 --> 26:02.383
- Okay. One hour.
- SONNY: Sweet.

26:02.468 --> 26:04.086
Keep it together, guys.

26:04.219 --> 26:05.789
All right.
All right.

26:06.207 --> 26:07.733
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:07.818 --> 26:09.519
ALL:
Cheers.

26:09.603 --> 26:12.071
Whoo! Wow, stuff is harsh.

26:12.214 --> 26:14.719
[grunting, coughing]

26:14.869 --> 26:17.091
Pains me to every fiber
of my being.

26:17.175 --> 26:18.702
Think these guys will
leave when we need them to?

26:18.786 --> 26:21.397
What, you're questioning
my ability to clear a room?

26:25.156 --> 26:27.071
Vehicle just pulled up
at the safe house.

26:27.156 --> 26:29.540
They could be getting ready
to transport Latif.

26:29.625 --> 26:31.953
We have no intel
on a secondary location.

26:32.038 --> 26:34.321
If we lose Latif,
he's in the wind.

26:34.524 --> 26:35.844
Bravo has to move now.

26:35.929 --> 26:38.761
The team's window to exit safely
is not for another 15 minutes.

26:38.846 --> 26:40.677
Okay, well, we scramble
the transport early.

26:40.762 --> 26:41.946
That's not gonna work.

26:42.046 --> 26:44.727
Create a diversion on the base
to draw the guard off.

26:44.812 --> 26:46.664
We don't have a full team.

26:46.749 --> 26:49.829
You're telling me
four Tier One operators

26:49.914 --> 26:52.266
can't outwit one security guard?

26:53.086 --> 26:54.694
Listen, I understand
what you went through

26:54.778 --> 26:56.133
in Caracas, Agent Ellis.

26:56.218 --> 26:57.556
And that you want to
keep doubling down,

26:57.640 --> 26:59.775
earn back what you lost.
But there is a limit.

26:59.997 --> 27:03.086
There's nothing to do
but wait and watch.

27:06.206 --> 27:08.515
- CLAY: Boom. Suck it.
- [groaning]

27:08.906 --> 27:11.008
SONNY: Suck it. Poker, pistols,

27:11.093 --> 27:12.290
not your day

27:12.375 --> 27:13.509
in Deadwood, comrade.

27:13.594 --> 27:15.323
All right, well, afraid
it's, uh, getting to be

27:15.407 --> 27:17.524
our bedtime, boys,
so we got to clean up here.

27:17.706 --> 27:19.555
Mm.All right.

27:19.640 --> 27:22.559
Sorry we could not, uh, throw
you a better goodbye party.

27:22.644 --> 27:25.703
But come here again, and
we'll show you the nightlife.

27:25.788 --> 27:27.271
Most beautiful women
in the world,

27:27.356 --> 27:29.100
right here in Turkmenbashi.

27:29.461 --> 27:30.861
Are you kidding me?

27:30.945 --> 27:33.469
It's taken you four damn days
to tell me this?

27:33.554 --> 27:35.164
You would have never left.Yeah.

27:35.471 --> 27:37.168
[alarm sounding]

27:40.399 --> 27:41.946
That part of your send-off?

27:42.433 --> 27:43.689
<i>[man speaking Turkmen over P.A.]</i>

27:43.773 --> 27:45.853
Base is on security lockdown.

27:45.938 --> 27:48.323
Nobody can come in
or, uh, go out.

27:49.790 --> 27:51.922
So, what do you say?

27:52.251 --> 27:54.296
Fun's just
getting started.

27:59.102 --> 28:00.853
Copy that, Havoc.
I'll tell the boys.

28:00.938 --> 28:03.657
Havoc is saying that the
shutdown is due to a threat

28:03.810 --> 28:06.540
from a separatist group
about 500 miles away.

28:06.673 --> 28:07.900
Yeah, well,
a couple of the Turkmen say

28:07.984 --> 28:09.735
these happen once a month.
False alarm.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.867
CLAY: Real or not, there's no
way our ride's getting on base now.

28:11.951 --> 28:13.416
SONNY:
This place ain't like Alcatraz.

28:13.500 --> 28:14.774
There's got to be
a way out.

28:14.859 --> 28:16.861
You know, I think I got
another card to play.

28:18.066 --> 28:19.244
Odeev.

28:19.601 --> 28:20.719
ODEEV:
I don't know, guys.

28:20.804 --> 28:23.524
Come on, hey. It's our last
night here, we can't sleep.

28:23.736 --> 28:26.063
You know, the party is,
it's on life support.

28:26.148 --> 28:27.581
And I told the guys here about

28:27.666 --> 28:28.931
what you said about
the local ladies.

28:29.015 --> 28:30.291
You know, unless you were telling tales?

28:30.375 --> 28:32.073
Yeah, I think he was telling tales.
It was the truth. - No, no.

28:32.157 --> 28:33.602
Well, let's go check it out.

28:33.687 --> 28:36.157
Okay, but the base
is locked down.

28:37.401 --> 28:39.930
Are you an operator
or an order taker?

28:44.680 --> 28:46.063
ODEEV:
Hey!

29:07.412 --> 29:09.852
JASON: Do we want to know
what's inside that package?

29:09.943 --> 29:11.989
Eh, probably not.

29:18.855 --> 29:21.204
Bona fide ninja, Odeev.

29:21.513 --> 29:24.519
[â™ª]

29:24.673 --> 29:26.969
[dance music pulsing]

29:27.054 --> 29:30.016
<i>Speaks in Turkmen...</i>

29:32.471 --> 29:34.947
[whooping]

29:35.829 --> 29:37.587
[laughs]

29:37.695 --> 29:39.640
ODEEV:
[laughs] Wow!

29:39.725 --> 29:41.596
Unbelievable.

29:42.125 --> 29:44.227
Come on.

29:44.858 --> 29:46.532
Wow.[laughs]

29:47.335 --> 29:49.686
Oh, my God.

29:55.040 --> 29:58.196
Okay. Did Odeev lie?

29:58.281 --> 30:00.845
Yeah, well, I've been fooled
by neon lights and smoke before.

30:00.964 --> 30:02.798
So I'm gonna reserve my judgment

30:02.970 --> 30:05.032
until I get up close
and personal.

30:05.173 --> 30:06.798
ODEEV:
Come on!

30:06.883 --> 30:09.541
Hey, you know what?
You're drinking on us tonight.

30:09.626 --> 30:12.329
Yeah. Let's go. Let's get some bottles,
baby. Let's go.

30:12.414 --> 30:14.071
Let's go, let's go!

30:14.155 --> 30:15.721
I really like you.

30:15.806 --> 30:16.854
RAY:
I like you, too.

30:17.321 --> 30:19.975
- ODEEV: Let's go!
- RAY: Come on.

30:26.399 --> 30:28.303
Havoc, this is 1.
I'm passing Daytona.

30:28.387 --> 30:31.102
Linked up with GRS
for the weapons and vehicles.

30:31.187 --> 30:32.626
That's a good copy, 1.

30:32.913 --> 30:34.110
Traffic's light.

30:34.195 --> 30:35.744
You should be on
target in ten mikes.

30:35.829 --> 30:37.345
Copy, Havoc.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.696
All right. They're on the move.

30:40.007 --> 30:41.269
Gun.

30:53.079 --> 30:54.649
We got a problem.

30:54.912 --> 30:56.392
Latif's on the move.

30:59.189 --> 31:01.025
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.989
Be advised, HVT is now mobile.

31:03.073 --> 31:05.587
Departing the safe house
in a silver VW sedan.

31:05.672 --> 31:06.937
How copy?

31:07.296 --> 31:08.387
JASON:
Copy, Havoc.

31:08.472 --> 31:10.129
Do we have
a second known destination?

31:10.214 --> 31:12.437
Negative, 1.
We have eyes on the vehicle.

31:12.522 --> 31:14.091
We can guide you
through the pursuit.

31:14.176 --> 31:17.055
Interdiction is gonna have
to happen vehicle to vehicle.

31:17.220 --> 31:18.845
Good copy, Havoc.
Show us the way.

31:18.930 --> 31:20.397
'Cause an outmanned
safe house hit

31:20.482 --> 31:22.441
with nuclear stakes is too easy.

31:25.322 --> 31:26.457
ERIC [over radio]:
Bravo 1, this is Havoc.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.478
Target vehicle
is one block east,

31:28.563 --> 31:31.288
moving parallel
on an intersecting street, over.

31:31.372 --> 31:32.681
JASON:
Copy that, Havoc.

31:32.765 --> 31:34.400
CLAY:
Havoc, this is Bravo 6.

31:34.485 --> 31:36.003
I got eyes on target vehicle.
How copy?

31:36.087 --> 31:37.512
I copy eyes on target.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.033
We still need a positive
identification on the HVT

31:40.118 --> 31:41.201
inside the vehicle.

31:41.286 --> 31:43.027
JASON:
Copy, Havoc. Bravo 1 out.

31:44.857 --> 31:46.688
Bravo 4, this is 1.
Making our move.

31:46.866 --> 31:48.196
Portside extract.

31:48.813 --> 31:49.813
You got the lead.

31:50.826 --> 31:52.915
TRENT:
Copy, Bravo 1. Taking the lead.

32:16.165 --> 32:19.579
JASON: Okay,
4. Ease past. Don't want to spook them.

32:19.664 --> 32:21.536
Need to I.D. him.

32:26.305 --> 32:28.214
Yeah, Bravo 6 confirms Hotel.

32:28.376 --> 32:30.149
That's Latif.

32:30.562 --> 32:32.868
JASON:
Bravo 4, lock them in.

32:34.696 --> 32:36.032
Execute.

32:47.143 --> 32:48.188
[tires screeching]

33:10.775 --> 33:12.649
JASON: Havoc,
this is 1. I pass Talladega.

33:12.734 --> 33:14.609
HVT secure.
Moving to handoff.

33:14.693 --> 33:17.510
That's a good copy, Bravo 1.
Nice work.

33:21.775 --> 33:23.008
You got your man.

33:23.189 --> 33:26.618
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

33:35.385 --> 33:37.387
[â™ª]

33:59.172 --> 34:01.174
[â™ª]

34:18.757 --> 34:20.889
[tires screeching]

34:22.565 --> 34:25.964
It used to be the unit
was a family. - Mmm.

34:26.049 --> 34:27.752
You know, like brothers,
thick and thin.

34:27.837 --> 34:29.623
- Yes.
- These days,

34:30.205 --> 34:31.947
feels like we're just, uh...

34:32.031 --> 34:34.297
A group of guys
doing their own thing.

34:34.380 --> 34:35.643
- Exactly.
- Yep.

34:35.728 --> 34:36.734
Okay, you understand this.

34:36.818 --> 34:38.081
Oh, yeah, more than
you know, brother.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.472
- More than you know.
- RAY: Yo, Sonny.

34:39.556 --> 34:41.581
Mm, what? These guys are looking
for Jason and the boys.

34:41.665 --> 34:43.065
You seen them?

34:43.150 --> 34:45.042
Jason, yeah.
Think he...

34:45.127 --> 34:48.702
he had a hankering for that, uh,
the meat on a stick.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.340
- Yeah.
- When he's got to eat, he's got to eat.

34:50.424 --> 34:51.270
Should be back any second.

34:51.353 --> 34:52.926
SONNY: Yeah,
I hear that's all the rage here.

34:53.010 --> 34:56.054
Yeah, it's crazy. Yeah.

34:57.839 --> 34:59.392
You know,
in the meantime, I...

34:59.477 --> 35:00.931
I think we're gonna
train you guys

35:01.016 --> 35:03.369
on some high-speed
Tier One tactics.

35:03.453 --> 35:06.416
Right? You ready, Olaf?
Watch and learn.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.811
- Hello, ladies.
- That's my guy.

35:09.895 --> 35:12.096
Come on, gents. I'll show you
how America does it.

35:12.181 --> 35:13.925
Check out my dance moves...

35:14.023 --> 35:17.726
[â™ª]

35:17.811 --> 35:19.468
[phone ringing]

35:20.088 --> 35:21.471
Ray, we're headed back
to the club.

35:21.556 --> 35:22.692
RAY:
Yeah, well, step on it.

35:22.777 --> 35:24.086
These guys
are getting suspicious.

35:24.170 --> 35:26.502
- This is getting sideways real quick.
- All right.

35:26.587 --> 35:28.347
- How far out are we?
- At least ten minutes.

35:28.471 --> 35:30.229
- JASON: All right.
- Hold on.

35:31.088 --> 35:35.175
Flossing? Nobody likes to floss?
How about two-step? - Two-step?

35:35.628 --> 35:36.968
Hey, tough crowd.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.449
- Think it got lost in translation, man.
- RAY [chuckles]: Yeah.

35:39.533 --> 35:41.190
[Sonny chuckles]Yeah,
what is going on here?

35:41.274 --> 35:42.535
SONNY: What is going on? Listen,
man,

35:42.619 --> 35:44.996
Wyatt Earp misses a shot
every once in a while. Okay?

35:45.081 --> 35:46.395
- Don't hold it against me.
- No, I'm talking about

35:46.479 --> 35:48.347
- the other SEALs.
- What? What about them?

35:48.432 --> 35:50.111
- Where arethey?
- RAY: All right.

35:50.196 --> 35:51.324
There's nothing to
worry about.

35:51.408 --> 35:53.675
They're just out getting
some fresh air is all. - Yeah.

35:53.761 --> 35:55.362
PRENKO:
Stop!

35:55.447 --> 35:57.698
All night,
you've been acting strange.

35:57.858 --> 35:59.073
Where are they?

35:59.264 --> 36:02.415
Odeev, you need to get your man,
he's... had one too many...

36:02.500 --> 36:04.592
No, I think we will
ask one more time.

36:05.237 --> 36:06.998
We would hate to tell our C.O.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.087
that we noticed the Americans
missing from base.

36:09.171 --> 36:11.293
Had to go out and
hunt them down.

36:11.378 --> 36:14.307
Stop lying and tell us
where your teammates went.

36:15.424 --> 36:17.347
Know what?
Hey, hard trying to find

36:17.432 --> 36:19.932
a good bottle of whiskey
in this town.

36:20.534 --> 36:22.348
That's top shelf right there.

36:22.677 --> 36:24.812
Appreciate
your hospitality.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.854
Mmm.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.159
Well, let's drink!

36:37.307 --> 36:39.886
You're back! [laughing]

36:40.064 --> 36:42.069
- You are crazy.
- You're crazy, too.

36:42.161 --> 36:43.800
[shouts, laughs]

36:43.907 --> 36:46.768
- Let's drink!
- [excited chatter]

36:55.576 --> 36:57.065
[snoring]

37:07.675 --> 37:08.930
You feeling okay
there, Clay?

37:09.014 --> 37:11.831
I haven't seen you swipe right
on a dating app in ages.

37:11.916 --> 37:14.965
It's kind of, uh,
the exact opposite, actually.

37:15.057 --> 37:17.059
Meaning?

37:18.284 --> 37:20.526
Stella wants
to get back together.

37:20.697 --> 37:23.595
Wow, uh... [scoffs]

37:24.214 --> 37:26.909
But-but you and Rebecca,
you're good, right?

37:28.026 --> 37:29.620
Yeah, better than good.

37:30.284 --> 37:32.344
And yet?

37:33.526 --> 37:34.979
Exactly.

37:35.815 --> 37:38.524
The history between you
and Stella, that's...

37:39.315 --> 37:40.800
like gravity.

37:41.159 --> 37:44.089
Imagine it'd pull you two
together even if you fight it.

37:44.761 --> 37:47.182
But history
isn't everything.

37:47.495 --> 37:49.576
Everyone evolves.

37:53.983 --> 37:55.628
I'd just...

37:56.182 --> 37:59.479
I'd make sure you're
pursuing what you want,

37:59.776 --> 38:01.718
not what you wanted.

38:10.464 --> 38:13.559
Reading Vic's e-mail
again? And again?

38:13.947 --> 38:16.561
- Can't shake it.
- Can't shake it? Ray.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.355
Got your warrant review
coming up.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.609
I don't want you
seeing any ghosts.

38:19.693 --> 38:20.849
It's not that simple.

38:20.934 --> 38:22.761
Yeah, it is.
It's real simple, Ray.

38:23.925 --> 38:25.484
If Vic can't deal
with losing Bravo,

38:25.568 --> 38:27.965
that's his problem.
It's not your problem.

38:29.120 --> 38:31.035
I'm thinking about
reaching out. Reaching out?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.578
Yeah, confronting the problem
instead of ignoring it.

38:32.662 --> 38:33.597
Where-where does that get you?

38:33.682 --> 38:35.165
Past is what makes
a person, brother.

38:35.361 --> 38:36.974
It's the same reason
Natalie wants to talk

38:37.058 --> 38:39.263
- about her ex-husband.Right.
- Well, it may work for some people,

38:39.347 --> 38:40.673
but not me.

38:41.565 --> 38:42.957
Yeah, you are
definitely more of a,

38:43.042 --> 38:44.285
uh, "ignore and
override" guy.

38:44.370 --> 38:45.809
That's right, you know?
And I apply that to my life,

38:45.893 --> 38:48.152
and it works.
Not just kicking in doors, Ray.

38:48.237 --> 38:49.996
It is not that simple.
It's not that simple?

38:50.081 --> 38:51.276
No.Okay.

38:51.361 --> 38:55.464
So, if I focus on what happened
between me and Alana...

38:56.940 --> 39:00.151
and how that ended,
how is that gonna help me

39:00.354 --> 39:02.050
with my present relationship?

39:04.814 --> 39:07.751
If your past kept you from
ever kicking in another door,

39:08.143 --> 39:09.572
that would be a shame.

39:10.104 --> 39:12.531
But if it keeps you from
ever opening yourself up

39:12.615 --> 39:15.270
to somebody again, brother,
that's a damn tragedy.

39:19.785 --> 39:21.645
I, uh, put a lot of thought
into this.

39:21.730 --> 39:22.802
I didn't want to screw it up,

39:22.886 --> 39:24.801
so I got some advice
before making my choice.

39:26.803 --> 39:29.766
The, uh, the guy
at the counter assured me

39:29.850 --> 39:32.421
that these dumplings
are life-changing.

39:32.505 --> 39:35.728
Ooh, are we sure we
want life-changing?

39:35.812 --> 39:38.644
I mean, I'm pretty
darn happy with mine.

39:38.941 --> 39:40.600
Me, too.

39:48.660 --> 39:50.787
Senior Chief Perry?

39:51.175 --> 39:53.800
I bet you're anxious
to put this review board to bed.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.957
Ready, sir. I need to mention something
before we get started.

39:57.042 --> 39:59.620
My office received a message
about you

39:59.808 --> 40:02.233
from Petty Officer
Victor Lopez.

40:02.652 --> 40:03.843
Sir?

40:03.927 --> 40:06.672
Well, Lopez said that
you called him this morning,

40:06.756 --> 40:08.754
and you helped talk him through
some hard stuff,

40:08.839 --> 40:10.410
and he commended you
for stepping up

40:10.495 --> 40:13.027
when others would have
ignored him.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.355
That's well done.

40:15.492 --> 40:17.323
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

40:17.767 --> 40:19.291
Let's get inside.

40:23.972 --> 40:27.432
JASON: Hey,
there you are. Nat-o-rama.

40:27.589 --> 40:30.696
Been waiting for you all day
just to come out to play, huh?

40:30.780 --> 40:31.959
Crazy Monday
schedule.

40:32.043 --> 40:33.636
Didn't have a chance
to come up for air.

40:33.721 --> 40:36.788
Staff meeting, PT observation,
peer review, right?

40:36.873 --> 40:38.910
Is that what they call
lifestyle-patterning?

40:38.995 --> 40:41.620
I just like to know
where you are, that's all.

40:42.300 --> 40:43.878
But not where I come from.

40:44.098 --> 40:45.755
Seems to be parts of me
you're avoiding,

40:45.839 --> 40:47.928
like my marriage.

40:54.925 --> 40:56.753
What do you want to tell me?

41:01.105 --> 41:04.294
Luke was a surfer.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.472
Uh, he worked at a brewery,

41:07.557 --> 41:12.035
and he was funny and sweet,

41:12.675 --> 41:14.433
till he wasn't.

41:15.160 --> 41:17.004
That's great.

41:17.745 --> 41:19.644
I appreciate
the effort, Jason,

41:19.729 --> 41:21.895
but a quick recap
of my marriage

41:21.980 --> 41:24.058
isn't going
to fix our issue.

41:24.510 --> 41:26.550
What's the issue?
What issue?

41:27.761 --> 41:29.495
A few months ago...

41:30.441 --> 41:33.020
you told me that
you wanted us to be all in.

41:33.214 --> 41:35.082
How can that be
if we don't share

41:35.167 --> 41:37.558
all of ourselves
with each other?

41:37.856 --> 41:39.793
You don't share your past
with me.

41:39.878 --> 41:41.583
It feels to me
like you don't

41:41.972 --> 41:44.308
really want me to know
who you are.

41:49.214 --> 41:51.456
It's been a long day,
so I'm gonna go.

41:53.081 --> 41:55.511
You know, I met Alana
when I was 14.

42:01.847 --> 42:05.008
You know, I can remember
everything that she said to me,

42:05.092 --> 42:07.403
but I... for the life of me,

42:07.488 --> 42:09.792
I can't remember anything
that I said to her.

42:12.839 --> 42:16.843
I would give anything
to... to remember.

42:19.019 --> 42:21.652
Last time I saw Alana,

42:22.433 --> 42:26.308
I can remember every word

42:26.636 --> 42:28.333
that I said to her.

42:34.267 --> 42:36.399
I'd give anything
to forget that.

42:40.189 --> 42:42.040
I'd give anything to
forget that.
