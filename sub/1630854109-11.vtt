WEBVTT

01:26.520 --> 01:28.656
Mm-hmm.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.191
Get down!

01:53.281 --> 01:55.249
Morning, boss. Morning.

01:55.349 --> 01:57.418
Thank you.
What are we looking at?

01:57.518 --> 01:59.220
Shooting. Three victims.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.788
One of them is John Oyama.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.823
Former Gunner's Mate
Third Class.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.258
Former?

02:04.358 --> 02:05.526
We don't usually
get called in for people

02:05.626 --> 02:06.794
separated from service.

02:06.894 --> 02:08.596
Except this isn't
exactly normal.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.498
John was the subject
of an investigation

02:10.598 --> 02:13.301
out of the NCIS office
in Yokosuka, Japan.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.703
What was he getting
investigated for?

02:15.803 --> 02:17.638
Some kind of theft.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.276
What was John doing out here?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.345
HPD's questioning
a witness.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.579
We're hoping
to find out.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.980
The shooting took place
around 3:00 a.m.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.550
I always say nothing good
happens that late.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.452
I wouldn't know anymore.
I'm normally passed out

02:31.552 --> 02:32.986
after bedtime stories.

02:33.086 --> 02:34.588
Hagrid impression
takes it out of me.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.657
You're a wizard, Harry.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.293
These are .223 casings.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.628
Likely from an assault rifle.

02:40.728 --> 02:41.829
Yeah, the tread suggests

02:41.929 --> 02:43.497
that the killer fled
on motorcycle.

02:43.597 --> 02:46.834
Probably a sport bike based
on the tire size and burnout.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.802
Forensics said
the same thing.

02:48.902 --> 02:50.804
Dad hunted subs
and he rode a Ducati 916.

02:50.904 --> 02:53.741
Badass. Like father,
like daughter.

02:53.841 --> 02:56.677
What are you thinking, boss?

02:56.777 --> 02:58.779
All this reads
like a gangland murder.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.248
I'm not answering
any questions

03:00.348 --> 03:01.649
until I have
my attorney present.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.384
You said they were
interviewing a witness.

03:03.484 --> 03:04.952
Nobody told me
it was Pike.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me, this is--

03:06.620 --> 03:07.921
Connor O'Shea,
Port Manager.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.158
And I refuse to speak
without counsel present.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.428
If you're done processing him,
we'll take him

03:14.528 --> 03:17.030
for questioning, thank you.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.699
Are you okay?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.067
Follow-up question.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.502
Why are you acting
like an insane person?

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
I really appreciate
all your concern.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.772
But it is
my constitutional right

03:24.872 --> 03:26.874
to have counsel present
at all times.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.844
All right, you heard the man.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.013
Let's get him a lawyer.

03:33.113 --> 03:35.416
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:35.516 --> 03:38.586
And please, for
everyone's sake, do.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.796
Hey, boss.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.198
What's with the--?
About to find out.

03:53.934 --> 03:55.636
Ow.
Okay, start talking.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.338
Okay, as port manager,

03:57.438 --> 03:59.039
it's my right--
As...

03:59.139 --> 04:01.609
Special Agent Neil Pike.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.577
Sorry, I apologize.

04:03.677 --> 04:05.279
It's habit. I was undercover.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.481
Yeah. I figured out that part.
Deep under.

04:07.581 --> 04:08.682
Like, it's
kind of hard to remember

04:08.782 --> 04:10.083
who Neil Pike is anymore.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.285
How long has it been?

04:11.385 --> 04:13.186
Three days?

04:13.287 --> 04:14.688
Right.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.089
Neil?
Yeah?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.525
Why were you in that
room last night?

04:17.625 --> 04:19.760
Because a dock worker reported

04:19.860 --> 04:21.261
being greased
by some Yakuza dudes

04:21.362 --> 04:23.631
about helping them
smuggle in goods, so I went

04:23.731 --> 04:25.466
under to find out more.
Yakuza?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.335
As in the organized crime
syndicate out of Japan.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.103
Yes, but then that means
that our former sailor

04:30.203 --> 04:31.539
was working for them.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.707
Any idea why somebody
would ambush that meeting?

04:33.807 --> 04:36.310
They just said they were
trying to smuggle in cigars.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.746
Okay, people don't
usually kill other

04:38.846 --> 04:41.114
people for cigars.
Well, it depends.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.216
I mean,
some cigars are pretty nice.

04:44.318 --> 04:46.153
DoD weapons.

04:46.854 --> 04:49.757
Gunner's Mate
Third Class John Oyama

04:49.857 --> 04:51.792
was accused of stealing
...50 cal machine guns

04:51.892 --> 04:53.527
destined for his ship.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.095
Wow.

04:55.195 --> 04:57.431
That is a lot
of heavy-duty firepower.

04:57.531 --> 04:58.999
NCIS at Yokosuka

04:59.099 --> 05:00.368
couldn't pin him
for it, but they never

05:00.468 --> 05:01.869
found the weapons, either.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.171
He could've been trying
to smuggle them here.

05:05.072 --> 05:08.376
Okay, even if this is
about weapons,

05:08.476 --> 05:12.145
triple homicide seems... big.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.782
Any leads on who might've
pulled that trigger?

05:14.882 --> 05:17.317
Not yet.
I'll follow up with HPD.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.953
Thanks.
Well, that still
leaves the missing

05:20.053 --> 05:22.356
giant, scary
machine guns.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.794
You think Connor O'Shea
can set up

05:26.894 --> 05:29.029
another meeting
and find out where they are?

05:31.665 --> 05:34.468
Connor O'Shea is a closer.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.069
Whoo!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.506
Okay.
He's also kind of a "whoo" guy.

05:38.606 --> 05:39.973
Yeah, okay, come on, let's

05:40.073 --> 05:41.609
get you to Ernie's office
and set up that meeting.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.377
Okay. Sorry about the "whoo."
It's fine.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.323
Hey!

05:56.424 --> 05:57.958
Got extra if you like.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.861
This isn't a social call.
I know.

06:00.961 --> 06:03.230
This is about you
siccing the FBI on me.

06:03.330 --> 06:06.667
Because you're using local
businesses to launder money.

06:06.767 --> 06:08.035
I'm helping
local businesses survive.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.703
And you murdered
the Koa brothers.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.304
You wearing a wire?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.742
Did you get
my dad mixed up in this?

06:14.842 --> 06:16.544
The FBI's investigating him, too?

06:16.644 --> 06:19.079
Not quite sure what irony is,
but I feel like we're there.

06:19.179 --> 06:20.948
Now is not the time for jokes.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.750
You really think Unko Wally
would break the law?

06:22.850 --> 06:25.519
No. But you definitely did.

06:25.619 --> 06:28.255
You loaned him money,
you took advantage of him.

06:28.355 --> 06:30.190
Think you're <i>akamai,</i>
got it all figured out.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.592
And you think
you're one step ahead.

06:31.692 --> 06:32.926
You find

06:33.026 --> 06:34.762
a local business
that's struggling,

06:34.862 --> 06:37.765
and you worm your way in.
He came to me.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.167
No.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.402
No, there's no way
my pops shows up

06:42.503 --> 06:44.572
hat in hand asking for money.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.273
Asking for help.

06:46.373 --> 06:47.708
And I did.

06:47.808 --> 06:50.010
Because that's what friends do.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.313
You came here wanting
to be mad at me,

06:53.413 --> 06:57.050
but maybe I'm not the one
you should be mad at.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.727
And the meeting is... set.

07:06.827 --> 07:08.796
They're sending a location soon.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.330
Nice job, Pike.
Who are you meeting with?

07:10.430 --> 07:12.833
The head honcho this time,
Kenji Sato.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.335
<i>Ikuzo.</i>

07:16.870 --> 07:18.071
What?
Nothing.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.073
Just the, uh, Japanese.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.775
You think it's strange
I know Japanese?
No.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.677
That's super cool.
Mm-hmm.

07:23.777 --> 07:24.778
But you think
I only know

07:24.878 --> 07:25.879
Japanese because I'm so

07:25.979 --> 07:27.247
into anime, don't you?

07:27.347 --> 07:29.483
Excuse me.
Yeah, that sounds about right.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.719
Well, actually, it all started

07:31.819 --> 07:34.354
in the winter of '96
with a seminal home-stay

07:34.454 --> 07:35.956
in Niigata.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.958
The Kurota family welcomed me
into their home,

07:38.058 --> 07:39.960
nestled deep in the valley
next to Hakkaisan--

07:40.060 --> 07:43.163
Yada, yada, yada. Now you're
testing fate a second time

07:43.263 --> 07:44.865
in two days to try to take down

07:44.965 --> 07:47.501
a Yakuza crime syndicate.
It's funny how life works.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.938
Come again.

07:51.038 --> 07:52.706
Well, you narrowly escaped death
less than 12 hours ago.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.307
And now you're
going back in again.

07:54.407 --> 07:57.177
This time with the head
of the gang.

07:57.277 --> 08:00.614
Someone I'm guessing
you wouldn't want to meet.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.215
Kenji Sato.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
Been arrested for criminal
mischief and aggravated assault.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.954
That's just the stuff
he got caught for.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.457
You have guts, my friend.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.093
Okay.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.228
I am making a terrible mistake.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
No, no, no.
All you're doing is

08:16.930 --> 08:18.799
meeting and getting
information about a shipment.

08:18.899 --> 08:20.701
And you'll have us

08:20.801 --> 08:22.335
with you. Right, Ernie?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.638
Yeah.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.374
Okay. Nano earbud.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.709
Button cam.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.343
As long as you have
your Bluetooth signal

08:30.443 --> 08:31.645
and your shirt...

08:31.745 --> 08:33.413
we'll have eyes and ears
on you at all times.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.882
See?

08:35.683 --> 08:36.650
Okay.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.919
Okay.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.688
They send the location
for the meet?

08:40.788 --> 08:41.989
Yep.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.757
Great. Remember.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.425
Eyes and ears on you
at all times.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.995
Yeah, um, about that...

09:06.079 --> 09:07.881
Oh, please tell me you guys

09:07.981 --> 09:09.883
found a way to hear me.

09:15.022 --> 09:17.124
Hey, man. You okay?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.326
Yeah, I just never been good
with these things.

09:19.426 --> 09:23.030
'Cause I am alone
and it is very awkward.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.937
Like, where do I even wait?
Okay, that's the best
we're gonna get.

09:30.037 --> 09:32.272
I told Pike
we'd be there for him.

09:32.372 --> 09:33.741
We have any way
of knowing when to go in?

09:33.841 --> 09:35.108
I mean, how do you say

09:35.208 --> 09:36.910
"no clue" in Japanese?

10:11.111 --> 10:12.980
Not again.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.083
You know, Boom-Boom would've
been able to make it work.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.818
Not all of us can be Boom-Boom.

10:22.189 --> 10:24.191
Got it, got it.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.526
I think that's
our cue to go in.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.381
Hey, Pike,
you all right?

10:48.481 --> 10:49.883
You're all right,
you're all right.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.819
I got you.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.653
Kenji's gone.

11:03.363 --> 11:05.498
It seems the assassin was
waiting to take out Kenji Sato.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.234
Bathhouse is
a pretty good spot

11:07.334 --> 11:08.902
to try to kill
a Yakuza boss. Hmm.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.204
Hey, how's Pike?
Uh...

11:11.304 --> 11:12.940
Pike is good, but, uh...

11:13.040 --> 11:15.675
Connor O'Shea has been
scared into retirement.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.878
Okay, well, did he at least
get any useful intel

11:17.978 --> 11:20.180
before the attack?
Not exactly.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.582
But we did get one answer.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.684
Our bathhouse assassin

11:24.785 --> 11:26.619
is the same killer
from the docks.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.588
MCRT searched his home.
They found

11:28.688 --> 11:30.323
a G-36C that matches

11:30.423 --> 11:32.192
the bullet casings
from the docks

11:32.292 --> 11:34.461
as well as a motorcycle,
and you called it, too.

11:34.561 --> 11:37.097
600cc sport bike.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.070
Those are Yakuza tattoos.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.305
But he has no affiliation
to Kenji Sato.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.742
So first the docks,
then the bathhouse.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.044
Clearly he was coming
after the Sato clan.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.747
Do we know if he has any
affiliation with a rival family?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.349
I tried to get
more intel, but...

11:56.449 --> 11:58.085
NCIS isn't
exactly dialed

11:58.185 --> 12:00.687
into the world
of the Yakuza.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.156
Well, good thing we know
someone who might be.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.992
The Sato Yakuza Clan
has long operated

12:05.092 --> 12:06.493
in the shadows of Hawai'i.

12:06.593 --> 12:09.763
Oda Sato was in charge
until the FBI put together

12:09.863 --> 12:11.498
a case and several
warrants against him.

12:11.598 --> 12:14.101
That sent him into hiding a few
years back, leaving his son...

12:14.201 --> 12:15.602
Kenji Sato...

12:15.702 --> 12:16.904
to take his place.

12:17.004 --> 12:18.705
And now someone's
gunning for them.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.373
The Machidas.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.042
These two families have

12:22.142 --> 12:23.777
hated each other
for decades.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.078
So all this is personal.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.814
Well, if there's
such bad blood, why are we

12:26.914 --> 12:28.615
only seeing bodies
drop now?

12:28.715 --> 12:31.819
Because Oda Sato negotiated
a truce before he fled Hawai'i.

12:31.919 --> 12:33.353
What broke it?

12:33.453 --> 12:35.088
You mean <i>who.</i> Kenji Sato,

12:35.188 --> 12:36.857
after he dishonored
the Machidas.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.126
What'd he, like,
tease one of them or something?

12:39.226 --> 12:41.594
Allegedly broke someone's neck
in a bar fight in Waikiki.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.730
Oh, okay, much worse.

12:43.831 --> 12:45.132
So Dad stops the war

12:45.232 --> 12:47.167
only for his son
to start it all over again.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.536
Gang war explains
why the Satos are trying

12:49.636 --> 12:50.838
to smuggle in .50 cals.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.940
I managed to pull all
of our former sailor's

12:53.040 --> 12:54.407
encrypted
text messages.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.109
Wow. Already?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.878
Sorry, FBI Cyber

12:57.978 --> 13:00.213
take, well... longer.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.549
Days? Weeks?

13:02.649 --> 13:04.852
I really shouldn't say.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.786
Ernie... what'd you find?
Eh--

13:06.887 --> 13:09.990
Kenji and our former sailor had
extensive text conversations

13:10.090 --> 13:12.259
about smuggling in the tools
to seal their victory.

13:12.359 --> 13:13.560
Sounds
like Kenji himself

13:13.660 --> 13:15.062
organized the DoD weapons haul.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.830
And I may
know where he is.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.566
The Sato family
has a house in Kahala.

13:19.666 --> 13:21.434
Well, let's go pay them a visit.

13:21.534 --> 13:23.871
Ernie, in the meantime, see if
you can locate those weapons.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.241
You got a plan?

13:28.341 --> 13:30.510
Convince Kenji
that a holding cell

13:30.610 --> 13:32.212
at NCIS is better
than the morgue.

13:32.312 --> 13:35.082
All right, assuming he
doesn't want to cooperate?

13:35.182 --> 13:37.484
Backup's waiting if necessary.

13:42.122 --> 13:44.391
May I help you?
Hi.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.326
I'm Special Agent in Charge
Jane Tennant.

13:46.426 --> 13:49.462
This is Special Agent
Jesse Boone, NCIS.

13:49.562 --> 13:52.265
We're looking
for Kenji Sato.

13:52.365 --> 13:53.600
I'm sorry.

13:53.700 --> 13:55.068
My brother's not here.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.337
Do you know
where he is?

13:59.506 --> 14:00.874
I'm afraid not.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.910
Please, come in.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.379
Thank you.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.521
You don't have to do this.

14:14.621 --> 14:15.822
Please allow me
the honor.

14:15.923 --> 14:17.224
My father would insist.

14:17.324 --> 14:18.458
Thank you.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.362
So...

14:22.462 --> 14:24.831
when's the last time you
heard from your brother?

14:24.932 --> 14:26.666
A few days ago.

14:26.766 --> 14:29.002
Is he okay?

14:29.903 --> 14:32.472
Someone tried to kill him
this morning.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.843
Why?

14:39.312 --> 14:42.082
How much do you know
about the family business?

14:42.182 --> 14:43.583
We work in imports.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.685
Goods from Japan. Porcelain,

14:45.785 --> 14:48.821
antiques.
Military-grade weapons?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.658
We know your family is Yakuza.

14:51.758 --> 14:52.859
And that your brother's
been working

14:52.960 --> 14:54.161
to smuggle in DoD weapons

14:54.261 --> 14:55.795
from Yokosuka with the help

14:55.895 --> 14:58.098
of a former sailor, John Oyama.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.167
John? No.

15:00.267 --> 15:01.734
He was recruited in Hiroshima

15:01.834 --> 15:03.270
to help in
third-party logistics.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.904
No, either you've been
kept in the dark,

15:05.005 --> 15:07.807
or you're not telling us everything.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.981
Are you and your brother close?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.684
We have grown apart
over the years.

15:17.784 --> 15:20.553
But still you must care
about what happens to him.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.656
He will always be family.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.857
So help us find him.

15:24.958 --> 15:26.326
He's caught up
in something,

15:26.426 --> 15:27.894
and he might not
make it out alive.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.662
I wish I could
tell you, but...

15:29.762 --> 15:31.999
I don't know.

15:43.610 --> 15:47.314
Tell me it's not true,
that you met with AJ Hale?

15:47.414 --> 15:48.848
How did you--?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.083
Of course we're surveilling him.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.285
You got to let
this thing play out.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.321
Look, it's...

15:54.421 --> 15:56.589
it's not easy
when your dad is wrapped up

15:56.689 --> 15:58.158
in an FBI investigation.

15:58.258 --> 15:59.759
I know. It's a lot.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.561
For both of you.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.033
My father, he didn't
do anything illegal.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.235
AJ told you that?

16:08.335 --> 16:09.969
Yeah.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.571
Because it's the truth.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.973
But, Kai,
the FBI and AUSA

16:14.074 --> 16:15.475
still have to do
their due diligence.

16:15.575 --> 16:16.743
Okay, how much longer?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.511
A while.

16:18.611 --> 16:22.115
But there is something
that can speed up the process.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.717
If Wally went
and talked with the FBI.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.653
Walked us through
all his books.

16:26.753 --> 16:28.921
A sign of good faith.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.392
You want to tell him that?

16:33.993 --> 16:36.396
It's probably better
coming from his son.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.666
Yeah.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.634
Are you tapped into

16:41.734 --> 16:44.171
the worldwide Automatic
Identification System?
Uh-huh.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.705
Because that's what we use

16:45.805 --> 16:48.541
to identify a ship's identity,
class, position, et cetera.

16:48.641 --> 16:50.210
And the Coast Guard is
the gold standard

16:50.310 --> 16:52.912
for tracking down ships.
You mentioned that. A lot.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.381
Hey.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.249
Any luck finding the ship
with the weapons on it?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.451
Uh, still looking,
but we'll find it.

16:58.551 --> 17:01.188
I know he's been through a lot,
but does he have to be here?

17:01.288 --> 17:02.722
Yes, the Coast Guard is
the gold standard

17:02.822 --> 17:04.023
for finding vessels at sea.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.358
Yes, I've heard.

17:05.458 --> 17:06.493
Besides, I figured

17:06.593 --> 17:08.428
you two could
help each other out.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.962
All right,
what do we got?

17:10.063 --> 17:11.531
We were looking
for container ships

17:11.631 --> 17:14.501
with anomalies
in their schedules, manifests...

17:14.601 --> 17:16.536
Algorithm did a check
on all ships bound to the U.S.

17:16.636 --> 17:19.306
from Japan.
So far nothing's standing out.

17:19.406 --> 17:20.907
Okay, Yumi said

17:21.007 --> 17:22.442
the family does
business in Hiroshima.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.312
Any ships heading
to Hawai'i from there?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.483
Doesn't look like it.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.018
Mm, that's odd.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.954
That ship there is not near
any normal shipping lanes.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.956
Um...

17:37.056 --> 17:39.092
tapping into the DoD's
mesh network

17:39.192 --> 17:41.628
of satellites,
pulling up the sat feed.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.333
That's because it's not
actually there.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.767
Somebody spoofed
the system.

17:47.867 --> 17:48.901
Fooled it into thinking

17:49.001 --> 17:49.869
the ship's somewhere it's not.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.738
Okay, well, where is it?

17:51.838 --> 17:53.440
Just a little geometry
and physics magic...

17:53.540 --> 17:56.042
Factor in that a cargo ship
travels around 24 knots.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.745
24 knots.

17:58.845 --> 18:01.348
There.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.352
Just off the coast of Kaua'i.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.720
Uh, at this rate, it's gonna
make port in just a few hours.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.955
Not if we get to it first.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.523
Assuming the Coast Guard
can lend a hand?

18:10.623 --> 18:11.791
Let's go.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.461
Special Agent Neil Pike
is back, baby!

18:19.766 --> 18:22.669
First time on a high-interest
vessel boarding?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.237
Yeah.

18:24.337 --> 18:26.306
Oh, I wish I could be you
right now.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.508
You never forget your first.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.477
Oh!

18:30.577 --> 18:32.044
He grows on you.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.380
Does he though?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.188
Coast Guard says...

18:41.288 --> 18:43.556
no one's talking
and the captain's acting cagey.

18:43.656 --> 18:44.857
Follow their lead and keep

18:44.957 --> 18:45.892
searching the ship for weapons.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.260
Okay, you got it, boss.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.561
Hey, I think I got something.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.230
The generator room
by the "foke-sul."

18:50.330 --> 18:52.299
The what?
The "foke-sul."

18:52.399 --> 18:55.168
Well, "forecastle," but it's
pronounced "foke-sul."

18:55.268 --> 18:56.936
Does this have to
do with weapons?
Maybe.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.506
The room's cordoned off-limits
to all personnel.

18:59.606 --> 19:00.507
Is that normal?

19:00.607 --> 19:03.042
No, that's not normal at all.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.925
It's stuck.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.427
Well, breach it.

19:20.527 --> 19:23.296
Well, normally
I have tools for that.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.471
Oda Sato?

19:32.372 --> 19:34.574
You're not
machine guns.

19:42.815 --> 19:44.751
Guess flying commercial
was out of the question.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.687
The price for being
a wanted man.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.589
Are the weapons
on board with you?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.291
I don't know about any weapons.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.393
The weapons your son conspired
to steal from the Navy.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.496
And the ones he intends
to use against your rivals.

19:56.596 --> 19:59.131
My son is doing
what he feels he must.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.768
But I assure you...

20:01.868 --> 20:03.836
that is not why I have come.

20:03.936 --> 20:06.806
You've come because the Machidas
attacked your family.

20:06.906 --> 20:08.308
To retaliate.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.176
I'm here to bring peace.

20:11.143 --> 20:13.346
We Yakuza have ways to reconcile

20:13.446 --> 20:15.214
and end wars.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.985
A war your son started.

20:21.821 --> 20:24.457
He is impetuous, but...

20:24.557 --> 20:26.426
he is still my son.

20:27.927 --> 20:31.097
Do the Machidas know
your intentions?

20:31.197 --> 20:33.966
We chose to keep it
a secret until I arrived.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.670
To limit the risk of someone
trying to intervene.

20:39.071 --> 20:42.074
I must perform
the ritual reconciliation.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.844
Atone for my family's
transgressions.

20:44.944 --> 20:46.513
If you arrest me,

20:46.613 --> 20:47.947
war will continue

20:48.047 --> 20:50.583
until only one family
is left standing.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.185
If you let me
complete my mission,

20:53.286 --> 20:55.722
peace will reign.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.824
And after that?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.859
You still have to answer
for your own crimes.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.495
I shall atone
for those, too.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.332
I will surrender
to authorities.

21:13.139 --> 21:14.974
You believe
his story?

21:15.074 --> 21:16.409
I believe he believes it.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.779
You're actually
considering letting him go.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.582
He's wanted for smuggling,
racketeering, coercion.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.917
And he might be the only way to
keep more bodies from dropping.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.218
All right, we finished
our sweep of the ship.

21:26.319 --> 21:27.754
And the DoD weapons
are still out there.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.288
All the more reason
to keep Oda.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
He could know where they are
and isn't telling us.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.225
Look, when Oda lands,
things will start to happen.

21:33.326 --> 21:34.961
Okay? You and Jesse
stay on him.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.530
He could lead us to
Kenji, the weapons,

21:37.630 --> 21:40.199
or maybe even the person
who ordered the hit on his gang.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.735
So he's bait?

21:43.770 --> 21:45.738
I wouldn't tell him that, but...

21:45.838 --> 21:47.374
yes.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.241
"Risk a stain on your record
if this plan doesn't work."

21:49.342 --> 21:50.643
That kind of bait.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.045
If you want to catch sharks.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.785
My bosses will never go for it.

21:58.885 --> 22:02.855
They will... if we both
ask them nicely.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.595
Everything you asked for.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.196
Paystubs, quotes for equipment,

22:10.296 --> 22:12.565
bank statements,
tax returns.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.435
Glad this is
all gonna be pau.

22:18.905 --> 22:21.340
Pop, this isn't gonna
make everything go away.

22:21.441 --> 22:22.942
So the FBI took me
away from my work

22:23.042 --> 22:24.210
to get all this
for nothing?

22:24.310 --> 22:27.046
No, it'll take time.
Been long enough.

22:27.914 --> 22:29.582
They have to make sure
that you didn't

22:29.682 --> 22:31.217
launder money for AJ.

22:31.317 --> 22:34.020
I've never done a crooked
thing in my life.

22:35.755 --> 22:37.857
The FBI, they need proof.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.627
And now they have everything.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.829
Not everything.

22:45.832 --> 22:47.434
Look, you have to talk to them.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.169
Work with them,
tell them what you know.

22:50.269 --> 22:52.238
I can't help,
because I don't know anything.

22:52.338 --> 22:54.974
Yeah, well, you better
think of something.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.043
You're a Fed, too.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.478
Can't you talk to them?

22:58.578 --> 22:59.946
I've tried.
Fix this!

23:00.046 --> 23:01.781
I am not the one

23:01.881 --> 23:04.150
who took money from a criminal.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.122
Why'd you do it?

23:10.222 --> 23:12.759
I got a business to run,
employees to pay.

23:12.859 --> 23:13.960
Why did you go to him?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.095
Because you weren't here.

23:21.267 --> 23:23.002
Dad--

23:23.102 --> 23:24.637
Let me know
when the FBI wanna talk.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.873
I'll figure out
how to be helpful.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.384
What--?

23:38.485 --> 23:40.186
You're still here?

23:40.286 --> 23:42.455
Yeah, my pencil rolled
under your desk.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.990
Oh, thanks.

23:44.090 --> 23:46.158
Maybe you should
take a break.
Come on.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.160
Half of the federal law
enforcement on this island

23:48.260 --> 23:49.662
may be out tailing Oda Sato,

23:49.762 --> 23:52.231
but I bet we could find
the weapons in the meantime.

23:52.331 --> 23:53.232
"We"?

23:53.332 --> 23:54.667
We found the boat Oda was on,

23:54.767 --> 23:55.868
didn't we?

23:55.968 --> 23:58.070
Combined,
we are unstoppable.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.239
Like when Goten and Trunks
did the fusion dance

24:00.339 --> 24:03.876
and became a single superior
being in <i>Dragon Ball Z.</i>

24:04.911 --> 24:06.646
I know you know that reference.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.049
To take on Majin Buu
in Chapter 480.

24:10.149 --> 24:12.451
Yes! Are we doing this dance
or what?

24:12.552 --> 24:14.654
How about we do
everything you're saying,

24:14.754 --> 24:17.757
minus the dancing?
I mean, it won't be as fun.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.492
And yet...

24:19.592 --> 24:21.761
I built a deep learning
algorithm to manually

24:21.861 --> 24:25.665
scan all satellite imagery
of ships squawking at sea.

24:26.933 --> 24:28.701
The fusion is already happening.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.570
You're using nautical lingo.

24:30.670 --> 24:32.171
But the problem is...

24:32.271 --> 24:34.206
everything
on the sea checks out.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.643
What about communication between
Kenji and our former sailor?

24:36.743 --> 24:39.512
The only thing I found is this.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.013
Translated, it means...

24:41.113 --> 24:44.617
"The expectation
for the shipment is great."

24:45.484 --> 24:47.987
That is one way
to translate it, yeah.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.890
You know better than
the translation tool

24:50.990 --> 24:52.825
powered by sophisticated
AI technology?

24:52.925 --> 24:54.460
Language is nuanced.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.363
Like this-this word here,
"kitai."

24:57.463 --> 25:00.099
That word was used by the
Japanese Army prior to 1945

25:00.199 --> 25:03.603
in reference to something
else... airplanes.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.808
"The airplane
for the shipment is great."

25:08.908 --> 25:10.309
They were using code.

25:10.409 --> 25:13.279
What if we could track
unconventional airplanes

25:13.379 --> 25:16.082
leaving Hiroshima that
were contracted by...

25:16.182 --> 25:18.551
I don't know, LLCs
or shell corps--
Got it.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.824
Oh.

25:24.924 --> 25:27.493
That is not what
I was expecting.

25:32.599 --> 25:33.800
Nice car.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.334
Thanks.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.436
I figured it leaned a little
more "family excursion,"

25:37.536 --> 25:39.338
a little less
"Feds on surveillance"

25:39.438 --> 25:42.141
while we keep an eye
on Oda Sato.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.481
Oda's off the ship,
walking over for his pickup.

25:49.582 --> 25:51.618
You think his first stop is
to meet with his son?

25:51.718 --> 25:53.319
Claims he's gonna
meet with his rivals.

25:53.419 --> 25:55.655
But I'm not sure
what to think.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.058
You're questioning whether
we should've let Oda go?

25:59.158 --> 26:01.393
It doesn't matter now,
because I did.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.866
How's our Agent Afloat doing?

26:06.966 --> 26:09.168
She's good.

26:09.268 --> 26:10.970
Yeah, Lucy's even comfortable

26:11.070 --> 26:13.039
standing on the flight deck now. Wow.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.974
Achievement unlocked.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.610
She's been sending me
a lot of pictures but...

26:17.710 --> 26:20.680
Let me guess, they all
kind of look the same?
Yes.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.081
It turns out, the middle

26:22.181 --> 26:23.850
of the ocean looks
like the middle of the ocean

26:23.950 --> 26:26.352
no matter what amazing country
you're anchored near.

26:26.452 --> 26:28.020
You didn't have the heart
to break it to her?

26:28.120 --> 26:29.722
She's just so proud
of the selfies.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.330
What?

26:38.430 --> 26:40.166
Ernie and Pike
tracked the .50 cals.

26:40.266 --> 26:42.769
They arrived on-island
two weeks ago by plane.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.436
Any idea where they are now?

26:44.536 --> 26:47.439
No, he said he lost the trail
when they got here.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.376
Oda said he didn't know
anything about the weapons.

26:50.476 --> 26:52.879
I mean, he could be
telling the truth.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.314
Or he's done nothing
but lie to us.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.149
I've got a bad feeling
about this.

26:57.249 --> 26:59.018
I'm pulling the plug.
Whistler!

26:59.118 --> 27:00.820
Whistler, hold on!

27:00.920 --> 27:02.989
Whistler, we don't know.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.757
And I don't think we should--

27:17.369 --> 27:19.338
It doesn't make sense to attack
now. Kenji's still in the wind.

27:19.438 --> 27:20.773
Oda was here to make peace.

27:20.873 --> 27:21.808
Not to mention
no one was supposed

27:21.908 --> 27:23.009
to even know he was coming.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.711
What did we learn
from Oda's car?

27:24.811 --> 27:26.278
MCRT's into it,
but at first glance,

27:26.378 --> 27:28.114
it looks like
the explosive was planted

27:28.214 --> 27:30.316
on the undercarriage
and remotely detonated.

27:30.416 --> 27:32.651
So the killer had to have known
he was coming ahead of time.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.586
And had access to the car.

27:34.687 --> 27:35.822
Seems unlikely the Machidas

27:35.922 --> 27:37.690
would've been able
to pull this off.

27:38.725 --> 27:41.694
What if it wasn't the Machidas?

27:42.594 --> 27:45.131
Could be an inside job.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.699
Someone within
the Sato organization

27:46.799 --> 27:48.901
orchestrating the hits, why?

27:49.001 --> 27:51.203
Guys, we found something.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.705
Where's Pike?
Designing matching nameplates

27:52.805 --> 27:54.673
in my office.
I wish I was joking.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.275
But while he was doing that,

27:56.375 --> 27:58.978
I was tracking phone calls
Oda made from the ship.

27:59.078 --> 28:00.512
Who was he calling?
He reached out

28:00.612 --> 28:03.215
several times to a cell phone
here on the island.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.787
Kenji?
Right family tree,
wrong branch.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.391
How are you holding up
after the explosion?

28:12.491 --> 28:14.526
Oh, it was nothing compared
to the reaming I took

28:14.626 --> 28:16.528
from ASAC Curtis
when I explained

28:16.628 --> 28:18.798
one of our most wanted fugitives
was blown up on my watch.

28:18.898 --> 28:21.033
I'm meeting with him and
the SAC later. That'll be worse.

28:21.133 --> 28:22.835
I'll talk to them.
No need.

28:22.935 --> 28:25.004
It wasn't only your call.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.373
Don't worry about it.

28:27.473 --> 28:29.075
Just because
you're FBI

28:29.175 --> 28:31.443
doesn't mean that we aren't
on the same team.

28:31.543 --> 28:32.812
That's literally what it means.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.447
It was my choice
as much as yours,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.084
and I won't hide behind you.

28:38.184 --> 28:40.419
Yumi Sato.

28:41.854 --> 28:47.093
Hi. This is FBI
Special Agent Whistler.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.697
Yumi, we're sorry
to hear about your father.

28:55.968 --> 28:59.638
My father had bought three koi
before he left.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.809
For him, my brother and me.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.778
Asked that I always
look after them

29:05.878 --> 29:08.114
as I would my own family.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.051
That's beautiful.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.389
We know your father called you
before his death.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.659
I... I haven't spoken
to him in years.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.661
We traced calls from
his ship to your number,

29:22.761 --> 29:23.796
so please don't lie.

29:23.896 --> 29:25.064
Don't want to have
to arrest you.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.365
I don't know anything.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.801
You knew your father was coming. Yumi...

29:29.902 --> 29:32.438
...you must have known why.

29:37.009 --> 29:40.847
I do. I'm the one
who asked him to come.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.481
My father was here

29:42.581 --> 29:45.051
to repair all the damage
my brother has done,

29:45.151 --> 29:48.520
make peace with the Machidas,
restore our family's honor.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.755
Well, why not

29:49.856 --> 29:51.323
let your brother do it?
He's in charge.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.762
Because he wouldn't do it.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.635
Look, did Kenji know

30:03.735 --> 30:05.872
that your father was coming
to clean up his mess?

30:05.972 --> 30:07.273
He found out
when we set the meeting

30:07.373 --> 30:09.141
with the port manager
at the docks.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.342
The meeting
that was ambushed?

30:10.442 --> 30:11.577
And you didn't feel

30:11.677 --> 30:13.179
you could tell Kenji before.

30:13.279 --> 30:15.982
Because you were too afraid
of how he'd react.

30:17.349 --> 30:19.852
Where is your brother now,
Ms. Sato?

30:19.952 --> 30:21.253
I don't know.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.423
My brother may not
have liked my father's plan,

30:24.523 --> 30:27.259
but he couldn't
have done... this.

30:27.359 --> 30:30.529
Then why isn't he here
with you right now,

30:30.629 --> 30:33.099
mourning your father?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.568
<i>Still no luck</i>

30:36.668 --> 30:37.703
finding Kenji.

30:37.803 --> 30:39.138
Maybe he's gone for good.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.740
No. He wants to hold onto power.
He'll stay.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.310
We're sitting on Yumi in case
she tries to go after him.

30:44.410 --> 30:48.514
In the meantime, we found
Kenji has multiple aliases

30:48.614 --> 30:50.249
on bank accounts and LLCs.

30:50.349 --> 30:52.151
Got proof he used
one of them to hire

30:52.251 --> 30:54.453
the assassin who killed
the people at the docks

30:54.553 --> 30:55.955
and tried to kill Pike.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.157
Trying to prevent his father
from being smuggled in.

30:58.257 --> 31:00.893
While making it look like
their rivals were responsible.

31:00.993 --> 31:03.629
A clever plan--
frame the Machidas

31:03.729 --> 31:06.865
and use war as a cover
to consolidate his power.

31:06.966 --> 31:10.202
You go. You go.
I'm gonna...

31:10.302 --> 31:13.339
I found...

31:14.140 --> 31:16.875
We found the weapons.
There was a warehouse.

31:16.976 --> 31:18.077
With a personal guarantee signed

31:18.177 --> 31:20.179
to one of Kenji Sato's aliases.

31:20.279 --> 31:22.982
And we think that's where
the weapons are being held.

31:25.817 --> 31:27.319
Guys, Yumi's on the move.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.820
Pike, you and I will
go after her. Yeah.

31:28.921 --> 31:29.855
Jesse, Kai, you're
on the warehouse.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.223
Find the weapons.

31:31.323 --> 31:32.391
Ernie.

31:32.491 --> 31:33.993
Great job.

31:34.093 --> 31:36.062
<i>NCIS!</i>

31:43.135 --> 31:46.238
Kenji was here.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.010
Clear!
Clear!

31:51.978 --> 31:53.879
Think we found the weapons.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.586
All these crates are .50 cals.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.590
I wish you didn't just say that.

32:05.891 --> 32:07.626
Because one's missing.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.103
Hey, Kai.

32:17.203 --> 32:19.005
Kenji's at large
with a .50 cal machine gun.

32:19.105 --> 32:21.107
No idea where he's headed.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.742
I think I have an idea.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.244
I'm sending you my location,

32:25.344 --> 32:26.912
but I need you
to get here as fast as possible.

32:27.013 --> 32:29.415
Copy.
On our way.

32:35.887 --> 32:37.356
Nakanaori Sakazuki.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.957
It's the reconciliation meeting.

32:39.058 --> 32:41.293
Yumi's not here
to find Kenji.

32:41.393 --> 32:42.828
She's here meeting
her rivals, trying

32:42.928 --> 32:44.830
to finish what
her father started.

32:44.930 --> 32:46.165
Well, peace isn't
gonna last long

32:46.265 --> 32:47.866
if Kenji shows up
with a .50 cal.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.268
And they're gonna be sitting
ducks, 'cause no one's supposed

32:49.368 --> 32:51.003
to be armed at these things.

32:52.138 --> 32:53.705
We're going inside, aren't we?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.474
Let's go.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.095
Want me to translate?

33:17.196 --> 33:19.831
Okay, cool. You got this.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.704
Machida clearly thinks
he's been set up.

33:27.539 --> 33:30.076
Enough! You're all
in danger here.

33:33.879 --> 33:35.981
We are here to make peace.

33:36.082 --> 33:38.250
Your brother is not.
You have been set up.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.352
But only by one person.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.255
Kenji Sato.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.625
We need to go now.

33:48.827 --> 33:51.563
I'm trying to end this war.

33:51.663 --> 33:52.898
Survive first.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.286
Oh, we're too late.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.787
Maybe we can flank 'em.

34:19.825 --> 34:22.060
Oh, crap!
Go, go, go!

34:23.462 --> 34:24.830
Come on, Jesse!

34:25.897 --> 34:27.866
Damn!

34:33.172 --> 34:34.673
Hey, you guys have
a plan up there?

34:34.773 --> 34:36.275
We're fielding ideas!

34:41.880 --> 34:43.949
What do you think?

34:44.049 --> 34:47.753
Look, there's a way
out the side of this building.

34:47.853 --> 34:49.355
You may not be able
to flank him, but I can.

34:49.455 --> 34:52.124
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Tennant!
You can't go alone.

34:56.195 --> 34:57.596
On my way!

34:57.696 --> 34:59.798
Stay with her.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.601
Wish me luck.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.170
<i>Ganbatte.</i>

35:18.083 --> 35:19.518
Cover us.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.420
Copy.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.289
Now! Now! Now!

35:54.686 --> 35:57.022
Thank you, Agent Tennant,
for saving us.

35:57.122 --> 35:58.524
Well,

35:58.624 --> 36:01.393
it wasn't just me.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.932
You knew
your brother did all this,

36:07.032 --> 36:10.035
yet you still tried
to fix everything. Why?

36:10.135 --> 36:12.338
Because that's what
my father would have wanted.

36:12.438 --> 36:14.673
It was my duty to try.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.244
This was all for duty?
For family.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.281
A concept
my brother never understood.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.754
Well, I hope you don't plan on
continuing the family business.

36:28.854 --> 36:31.590
I was only here to honor my
father. The business was his.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.592
Good.

36:33.692 --> 36:36.161
Because that would be... unwise.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.675
You're going
to watch her, right?

36:49.775 --> 36:52.010
Hundred percent.

36:57.983 --> 37:00.552
Hey, you know you can,
uh, take that off now?

37:00.652 --> 37:02.688
Oh, yeah, I know. I also know
that I've been shot at

37:02.788 --> 37:05.791
kind of a lot
over the last few days, so... Okay.

37:05.891 --> 37:08.394
So, you're just gonna
keep it on every day now?

37:08.494 --> 37:11.129
Well, considering both
Connor O'Shea and I are now both

37:11.229 --> 37:13.932
known entities
to all the local Yakuza gangs...
Well, the FBI

37:14.032 --> 37:16.368
took most of the Yakuza members
in for questioning.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.103
And with all the intel
that they've got on them,

37:18.203 --> 37:19.571
it's only a matter of time

37:19.671 --> 37:21.307
before they shut down
their operations, so...

37:21.407 --> 37:24.209
Well, it does not hurt
to be cautious, so...

37:25.511 --> 37:26.912
I come bearing gifts.

37:27.012 --> 37:28.514
Hey.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.983
I know that we're buds now,
but you did not have to.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.886
I-I didn't.
It's-it's for all of us.

37:34.986 --> 37:37.188
From the Yokosuka NCIS office.

37:37.289 --> 37:39.024
Awesome.
Oh, that's nice.

37:39.124 --> 37:41.460
Like a "thank you" for closing
their stolen weapons case?

37:41.560 --> 37:43.161
Yup.
Ooh.

37:43.962 --> 37:46.365
Take it. Uh...

37:46.465 --> 37:48.767
No, please take it.
Like, consider it a thanks.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.769
For what?

37:50.869 --> 37:52.137
For letting me
team up with you.

37:52.237 --> 37:54.940
You know, catch come killers,
find some weapons.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.042
Rediscover who Neil Pike
really is, you know?

37:57.142 --> 38:00.379
I... I really appreciate it.

38:01.980 --> 38:02.981
All right, you were

38:03.081 --> 38:05.050
undercover for three days.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.352
You're talking
about objective time.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.786
I'm talking more about

38:07.886 --> 38:10.356
what Henri Bergson
would call "la durée,"

38:10.456 --> 38:14.259
which is the time
of subjective experience.

38:16.695 --> 38:18.296
Bergson said that.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.731
Did he?

38:20.832 --> 38:22.968
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.982
Thought you was
bringing people.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.217
Yeah, they're outside, but, um,

38:39.317 --> 38:42.320
look, I just wanted
to talk to you first.

38:44.723 --> 38:46.825
Look, I shouldn't
have judged you

38:46.925 --> 38:50.762
for taking money
from AJ when I...

38:50.862 --> 38:53.832
when I wasn't even
around to help.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.971
Pop, I just... I...

39:00.071 --> 39:02.774
I have so many regrets.

39:02.874 --> 39:06.645
Son, I don't know everything,

39:06.745 --> 39:08.680
but there's one thing I learned.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.583
Life's too short for regret.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.854
What matters is right now.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.591
Yeah?

39:21.427 --> 39:23.128
Yeah.

39:23.228 --> 39:26.064
Now, where your friends stay?

39:34.606 --> 39:36.908
They'll, uh, talk
to you privately.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.910
Yeah, uh,

39:39.010 --> 39:40.446
I don't think that's gonna work.

39:40.546 --> 39:42.781
You said you would
talk to them.

39:42.881 --> 39:46.618
Yes. We all are.

39:48.954 --> 39:51.122
All these people

39:51.222 --> 39:53.425
done business with AJ.

39:54.693 --> 39:57.563
Found a way to be helpful.

39:57.663 --> 40:00.432
So, what you think?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.138
I think we're going
to need more agents.

40:16.281 --> 40:18.617
Hey. Got your invite. What's up?

40:18.717 --> 40:21.052
Oh, yeah. Please.

40:21.152 --> 40:23.221
Thank you.
You're welcome.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.390
How'd the talk with your SAC go?

40:25.491 --> 40:29.060
Good. He, uh... he wants
to give me a medal.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.329
First of many.
I wasn't expecting it

40:31.429 --> 40:34.065
after what happened to Oda Sato.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.134
Look, calls you make
in the field

40:36.234 --> 40:38.369
sometimes don't cut our way.

40:38.470 --> 40:41.072
And sometimes,
they still work out.

40:41.172 --> 40:44.342
The only thing
we can rely on is each other.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.880
I'm sorry...

40:48.980 --> 40:52.450
for not accepting your offer
to help with my bosses.

40:52.551 --> 40:53.819
It just

40:53.919 --> 40:55.420
felt like
I had to handle it alone.

40:55.521 --> 40:58.023
But you're not alone
is what I'm saying.

40:58.123 --> 40:59.691
You're part of a team.

40:59.791 --> 41:02.027
Two teams, I guess.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.929
Look, I can't speak for the FBI,

41:04.029 --> 41:06.732
but I will always
have your back.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.301
Just like you had mine
running towards a .50 cal.

41:12.237 --> 41:14.139
That's deeper than a team.

41:14.239 --> 41:16.642
That's a family.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.945
I'm the FBI liaison who happens

41:20.045 --> 41:21.747
to be dating one of your agents.

41:21.847 --> 41:26.384
It's more like
family adjacent.
You are family, Kate.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.627
So, what medal is it, anyways?

41:35.727 --> 41:38.063
Apparently the one you get

41:38.163 --> 41:40.131
when you get shot at
by a big-ass gun.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.735
That's a good one.
