WEBVTT

00:42.459 --> 00:45.629
You know,
I didn't wanna say it at the time

00:45.629 --> 00:49.466
'cause I'm trying to be
less stuck in my fucking ways...

00:50.050 --> 00:51.051
But?

00:52.553 --> 00:54.888
But I thought it was nuts to change
our entire philosophy

00:54.888 --> 00:56.348
and style of play mid-season.

00:56.348 --> 00:57.432
But?

00:58.892 --> 01:00.102
But it's fucking great.

01:00.978 --> 01:02.980
You know, they're having fun,
we're having fun,

01:02.980 --> 01:04.982
these folks are having fun.
It's a whole bunch of fun.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.820
I haven't seen 22 dudes have
this good a time on grass

01:09.820 --> 01:12.990
since I saw the Grateful Dead jamming
with the Black Crowes and Phish.

01:12.990 --> 01:14.575
I bet that was a tight show.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.327
It was a mess. But they had fun.

01:21.874 --> 01:22.958
- Beautiful!
- Shoot!

01:27.796 --> 01:30.299
Yeah!

01:32.426 --> 01:34.261
Whistle! Whistle!

01:34.261 --> 01:35.846
That's half. Great job.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.099
You hear that?
Roy said y'all did a great job.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.230
Nice shot, mate.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.534
Ay, Chihuahua.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.078
I can't remember which pair is clean
and which one is dirty.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.122
You bundle your dirty socks?

02:02.998 --> 02:05.834
Just because they're dirty doesn't mean
they don't deserve to have a friend.

02:05.834 --> 02:08.794
He's right. After all,
we're all mates with Richard.

02:18.013 --> 02:19.014
Hey, boyo.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.685
Do you wanna get a beer
or something later? Have a chat?

02:25.062 --> 02:26.063
No.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.787
Ay, no. I chose the dirty socks.

02:43.872 --> 02:44.873
Oops.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.445
So, have you heard from Jack yet?

03:17.030 --> 03:19.533
You know how you're never ever
supposed to write another text

03:19.533 --> 03:21.076
to an unanswered text?

03:21.577 --> 03:22.578
Of course.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.080
Oh, God. You sent a double text.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.799
So much blue.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.925
I know.

03:37.426 --> 03:40.220
It's like I got diarrhea of the thumbs
or something.

03:40.846 --> 03:41.847
Come here.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.224
Uh-oh.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.226
When girl talk turns into girl hug,

03:46.226 --> 03:48.437
you know that either means
something horrible's happened

03:48.437 --> 03:49.855
or absolutely nothing at all.

03:49.855 --> 03:51.440
Jack's ghosting Keeley.

03:51.440 --> 03:52.816
Oh, no.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.695
First, she wants to go on a break,
and now the old digital Irish goodbye.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.656
Which is a term I never really understood.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.117
'Cause I got a buddy back home
named Seamus O'Malley,

04:02.117 --> 04:04.620
and that son of a gun hugs folks goodbye
for, like, 20 minutes

04:04.620 --> 04:05.621
before he leaves anywhere.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.581
Yeah, sorry to hear about that.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.626
Hey, I did make you some biscuits,
you know, just to soften the blow.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.835
Thanks, Ted.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.086
Thank you.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.130
What?
There's like 40 quid in here.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.050
I didn't know you were
gonna be here till this morning.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.886
No time to do anything special,
so I just tossed a little cash in there.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.013
That is very sweet. Thank you, Ted.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.431
Ain't nothing to it but to do it.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.100
Hey, boss. You mind if
I skip the press conference today?

04:27.100 --> 04:29.394
Michelle and I got these parent-teacher
meetings I don't wanna miss.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.688
Of course, Ted. Family first.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.648
I appreciate it.

04:34.274 --> 04:35.400
We could have Roy do it.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.487
I know he hates that stuff,
but he is really good at it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.614
I mean, you know, fine by me.

04:40.614 --> 04:41.698
Great idea.

04:42.366 --> 04:45.077
Look at you. Heartbroken,
but still kicking butt.

04:45.077 --> 04:47.621
I mean, I'm not heartbroken.
It's more like heart-bent.

04:48.539 --> 04:49.957
Heart-bent. I like that.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.417
It's a great title for a country song.
You know, like...

04:52.417 --> 04:55.671
<i>I'm heart-bent in my apartment</i>

04:55.671 --> 04:58.799
<i>'Cause all that you left
Was your fart scent</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:00.008
All right. Goodbye, Ted.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.760
<i>And now that you're gone</i>

05:01.760 --> 05:04.930
<i>I wrote this song
'Cause all you left was</i>

05:04.930 --> 05:06.849
<i>The smell of your farts</i>

05:06.849 --> 05:08.183
- Coach Kent.
- Hey.

05:12.521 --> 05:13.814
Speak of the devil.

05:14.398 --> 05:15.274
Okay.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.735
- Keeley.
- Roy.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.154
So I need you to fill in for Ted

05:21.154 --> 05:22.990
at today's press conference,
if that's okay.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.324
Fuck no.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.788
I mean, why can't Ted do it?

05:34.209 --> 05:37.045
I mean, I'd love to.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.130
Wonderful.

05:38.881 --> 05:39.882
Shall we?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.595
Fuck.

05:44.595 --> 05:45.637
I heard that.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.571
Delivery for Mr. Shelby.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.572
It's Shelley.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.700
Oh, my-- I'm so sorry.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.744
Hey, what are you doing here?

06:08.744 --> 06:10.662
I brought you lunch.
Figured we'd have it here.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.331
I'm surprised Derek gave you the time off.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.582
He said it was fine.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.126
As long as I brought him back
something with a West Ham logo on it.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.086
Well, I can do that.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.714
How about--

06:20.714 --> 06:22.674
There you go. Mouse pad.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.844
And he can have a scarf.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.763
So sorry. There you go.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.849
The-- And there. That's the official pro--

06:30.849 --> 06:34.478
And actually, you know--
Just don't have that.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.021
I only need one.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.315
Well, you know, just keep them
for next time.

06:44.196 --> 06:45.989
Oh, dang.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.825
You got to his afternoon kiss
before I did.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.661
Rupert, hello.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.247
Okay. So, Jade, this is Rupert, my boss.

06:53.247 --> 06:56.583
And, Rupert, this is Jade, my girlfriend.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.168
Well, hello there.

06:59.086 --> 07:01.088
- Hello.
- It's worthwhile to meet you.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.133
Jade. What a beautiful name.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.136
Thank you. It's actually short for Jaded.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.055
My mother named me
after her favorite aunt.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.306
But I don't care.

07:11.306 --> 07:18.021
Hold on. I like to consider myself
a bit of a-- an amateur dialectologist.

07:18.021 --> 07:22.192
You are from the south of Poland, right?

07:22.860 --> 07:24.611
Yes, I'm from Nowy SÄ…cz.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.239
Would you look at that smile.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.118
Yeah, Jade,
if this young man wasn't so brilliant,

07:31.118 --> 07:33.287
I'd say that you are out of his league.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.834
What's that smell?

07:39.334 --> 07:40.836
Jade surprised me with lunch.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.213
It's from the Taste of Athens.
It's my favorite place.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.549
I'm a hostess there.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.344
Which is why it's his favorite place,
I would say.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.596
Yeah.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.639
Well, wonderful to meet you, Jade.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.517
And, Nate, mate,

07:56.894 --> 07:58.729
don't screw this up.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.272
No.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.400
Bye, Rupert.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.071
He seems very wealthy. But also nice-like.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.158
Yeah, no, he is.
He's actually really decent.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.494
I owe him a lot. So--

08:15.412 --> 08:16.872
Right.

08:16.872 --> 08:19.208
It's so kind of you doing this, you know.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.176
Pardon the interruption, Rebecca.

08:29.927 --> 08:33.013
Did you know that Ted wasn't
doing his press conference today?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.765
Yes. I asked Roy to fill in.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.059
That explains it.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.477
Is there a problem?

08:41.188 --> 08:42.731
That is not what I said, Gary!

08:42.731 --> 08:44.399
I have your quote right here!

08:44.399 --> 08:45.651
You did say it, Coach.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.070
- Stay out of this, Lloyd!
- Don't shout at Lloyd.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.197
You said, and I quote,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.408
"Joe Walsh is a better guitarist
than Jimmy Page."

08:53.408 --> 08:55.202
That's what you said.

08:56.453 --> 08:57.955
Fine! I said it!

08:57.955 --> 09:00.874
But what I meant was
that Joe Walsh, underrated.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.960
Jimmy Page, overrated!

09:03.669 --> 09:05.629
I mean, Joe Walsh is a poet.

09:05.629 --> 09:09.091
Jimmy Page is a fucking
court stenographer on Adderall.

09:10.384 --> 09:15.055
Are you out of your mind?
Page could beat Walsh with one string.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.516
What do you mean beat him?
It's not a competition, man!

09:17.516 --> 09:19.101
It's art, you fucking Neanderthal!

09:21.144 --> 09:22.521
- Okay.
- Hello!

09:22.521 --> 09:24.857
- Okay. I think this is over. Yeah.
- You're suspect!

09:24.857 --> 09:26.024
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

09:26.024 --> 09:28.735
Hello! I--

09:28.735 --> 09:31.864
"Stairway to Heaven" is a glorified
fingering exercise, and you all know it!

09:32.698 --> 09:33.699
So much passion.

09:34.283 --> 09:37.286
I can't think of the last time

09:37.286 --> 09:40.497
I was able to be here with all you absolutely...

09:40.497 --> 09:43.333
just brilliant members of the press
down here in the pressroom.

09:43.333 --> 09:46.044
So with that in mind, I would love
to take some questions.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.714
Come on, absolutely ask me anything.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.383
- Yes.
- Marcus Adebayo, <i>The Independent</i>.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.552
- Hello there, Marcus. How are you?
- Very well.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.012
- Good. Yes?
- Miss Welton,

09:55.012 --> 09:58.557
in your opinion, who's the greatest
classic rock guitarist of all time?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.311
Great question.

10:08.192 --> 10:10.068
Thank you. Thank you very much.

10:11.778 --> 10:12.905
Sorry about that.

10:12.905 --> 10:15.115
- "The guy from Cream."
- Yes, all right!

10:15.115 --> 10:18.118
Don't start with me, Leslie! I panicked.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.704
I'm gonna murder Roy Kent.

10:20.704 --> 10:24.082
Look, Roy not doing press
is just Roy being Roy.

10:24.082 --> 10:27.586
Oh, yes. Well, I am sick of Roy being Roy.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.506
So, it's time for Rebecca to be Rebecca.

10:30.506 --> 10:33.050
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I couldn't--

10:33.634 --> 10:35.511
Yeah. There you go.

10:35.511 --> 10:36.595
Yes!

10:40.849 --> 10:42.851
No, you get back down there.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.104
Why? I already did my 20, easily.

10:46.104 --> 10:49.066
Yeah.
We don't start counting until it hurts.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.734
And that goes for all of you!

10:50.734 --> 10:52.361
Oi! Kent!

10:53.612 --> 10:56.031
Get your hairy arse into my office. Now!

11:07.960 --> 11:12.673
Every single one of you
knows my arse isn't hairy.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.259
Yet none of you spoke up.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.305
And I will never forgive you.

11:27.271 --> 11:30.357
He's right. We're cowards.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.069
Now, if she was talking
about Richard's butt...

11:49.877 --> 11:52.963
So, are folks still dissecting frogs
in science class these days

11:52.963 --> 11:55.674
or is it all just talking about
the frog's feelings now?

11:55.674 --> 11:57.384
<i>Honestly? Both.</i>

11:57.384 --> 12:00.137
<i>Ms. Ledbetter,
is there anything Henry can be doing</i>

12:00.137 --> 12:01.847
<i>to bring up his grade in your class?</i>

12:01.847 --> 12:02.848
Coach, can I--

12:03.974 --> 12:05.392
Yeah, besides helium.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.770
Isaac knows.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.732
That Ted's son is failing science?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.401
Scandal.

12:15.861 --> 12:18.030
- How did he react?
- Not good.

12:19.156 --> 12:20.282
He won't talk to me.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.451
Give him a minute.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.620
You shouldn't have to,
but some people need it.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.622
Don't forget, you've known you were gay
for 20 years.

12:26.622 --> 12:28.248
Much longer than that.

12:28.874 --> 12:31.084
Once I was out of my mum,
I never looked back.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.049
But I hear you. Thanks, Trent.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.678
Yeah. Hey, but you know what my favorite
thing was about Sir Isaac Newton?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.430
He was so down to Earth.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.891
<i>Ted, we need to let her go.</i>

12:45.891 --> 12:48.227
Yeah, we better go let Ledbetter go.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.439
What the fuck is your problem?

12:52.439 --> 12:54.942
Wait, I know this one. You are!

12:55.943 --> 13:00.781
If I ask you to do a press conference,
do the fucking press conference.

13:00.781 --> 13:04.451
Okay. Shit. I'm sorry.
I didn't realize it was a big deal.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.370
So you just didn't do it?

13:07.829 --> 13:09.623
Is that the plan
for the rest of your life?

13:10.123 --> 13:11.875
You're just gonna walk away
from everything

13:11.875 --> 13:14.253
the second it isn't fun or easy?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.341
What do you want, Roy?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.386
What do you really want?

13:23.428 --> 13:24.721
I just want to be left alone.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.809
Oh, bullshit, Roy!
You want way more than that!

13:28.809 --> 13:32.271
You're just so convinced that you
don't deserve anything good in your life,

13:32.271 --> 13:35.983
that you'd rather eat a bowl of shit soup
and then complain about the portions.

13:38.235 --> 13:40.696
Get out of your own way, man.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.782
'Cause this whole "woe is me" thing
you've got going on

13:43.782 --> 13:46.994
is just fucking ponderous.

13:52.457 --> 13:53.458
Is that all?

13:55.252 --> 13:56.503
Yeah, that's it.

13:58.463 --> 13:59.590
For now.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.213
How we looking for tomorrow?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.965
Yeah. Great.

14:42.466 --> 14:45.093
Think we should play without a goalie.
You know, just to give 'em a chance.

14:45.761 --> 14:47.054
I love it when you're cocky.

14:52.017 --> 14:53.018
Baklava.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.311
Oh, yeah. Help y--

14:57.105 --> 14:59.066
- Yeah.
- So lovely to meet Kate.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.069
Jade. It's Jade.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.571
Oh, yes. Of course. Jade. Yeah.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.406
Well, she really enjoyed meeting you.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.243
Nothing better than the love of a woman.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.524
Sitting up there but it's just
a little bit-- We'll get a drink.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.693
Yo. Knock 'em dead, killer.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.280
Well, I hope their kit man remembered
to bring 11 body bags.

15:47.489 --> 15:50.701
Hey, after the match,
let's go for a drink. If you're up for it.

15:52.244 --> 15:54.371
Yeah, that'd be great.
Shall I invite Jade?

15:54.371 --> 15:58.166
No, I was thinking it was just
the two of us. You know, a guys' night.

15:59.084 --> 16:02.171
Oh, yeah. That'd be lovely. I mean, cool.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.677
Right, let's go blow some bubbles.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.638
<i>Across town, West Ham are hoping
to stay top of the table</i>

16:11.638 --> 16:13.182
<i>against Southampton.</i>

16:13.182 --> 16:17.102
While here at Nelson Road,
the red-hot Greyhounds face Brighton.

16:17.769 --> 16:20.689
Color red tops off
at about 800 centigrade, Arlo.

16:21.190 --> 16:25.360
The way Richmond are playing, a more
accurate description would be yellow-hot.

16:25.360 --> 16:27.487
<i>Thank you for correcting me, Chris,</i>

16:27.487 --> 16:30.157
<i>and next time feel free
to wait until we're off air.</i>

16:31.617 --> 16:32.659
What's this?

16:32.659 --> 16:35.329
We're so full we ran out of pint glasses.

16:36.872 --> 16:37.748
Bottoms up.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.127
<i>Bringing in the money</i>

16:44.213 --> 16:45.214
That tastes better.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.591
<i>The denizens of the Dogtrack have seen</i>

16:47.591 --> 16:50.177
<i>their Greyhounds race up the table
of late.</i>

16:50.177 --> 16:52.804
<i>The air is filled with
an unfamiliar confidence</i>

16:52.804 --> 16:54.932
<i>of another trip to the winners' circle.</i>

16:54.932 --> 16:57.226
- Leslie, did you just text me?
- I did.

16:57.226 --> 16:59.394
- I'm sitting right here.
- I see that now.

17:00.812 --> 17:01.980
It's Jack.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.275
She's saying that she's in Argentina...

17:06.693 --> 17:08.111
for the next couple of months.

17:08.779 --> 17:09.780
Ouch.

17:11.281 --> 17:14.284
Well, I think our break
is actually an "up."

17:16.744 --> 17:19.248
So now that Jack is officially my ex,

17:19.248 --> 17:23.836
please feel free to say any of the things
that you didn't like about her.

17:23.836 --> 17:25.212
Well--

17:25.212 --> 17:27.881
Her handshake was way too firm.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.383
You know--

17:30.217 --> 17:31.844
I get it. You're friendly.

17:33.554 --> 17:34.555
Good riddance.

17:39.393 --> 17:41.103
All right, yo. Let's do this, man.

17:44.565 --> 17:45.649
Go get 'em, Captain.

17:48.402 --> 17:49.570
Isaac.

17:49.570 --> 17:52.906
All right, fellas, here we go.
Focus up, y'all.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.533
Coach, who we got today?

17:54.533 --> 17:56.159
Brighton and Hove Albion.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.537
Brighton, Hove and Albion.
I didn't know we were playing a law firm.

18:01.123 --> 18:02.624
Okay, let's bring it in. Here we go!

18:15.470 --> 18:17.055
Go ahead, Captain. Count us off.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.891
Richmond on C. A, B, C!

18:18.891 --> 18:20.100
Richmond!

18:26.023 --> 18:30.527
<i>Brighton have something going here,
until that heavy touch by Cooke.</i>

18:30.527 --> 18:31.445
<i>Oh, no!</i>

18:31.445 --> 18:32.821
<i>A thoughtless poke by McAdoo</i>

18:32.821 --> 18:35.282
<i>and a Richmond goal kick
becomes a Brighton corner.</i>

18:35.282 --> 18:37.659
<i>McAdoo lost concentration there.</i>

18:37.659 --> 18:39.995
<i>An uncharacteristic mistake
from the captain.</i>

18:39.995 --> 18:43.207
Well done, McAdoo, you fucking numpty!

18:43.207 --> 18:46.251
<i>Some of the Richmond fans letting
McAdoo have a piece of their minds.</i>

18:47.544 --> 18:48.921
<i>The corner comes in.</i>

18:49.880 --> 18:51.006
<i>And the keeper collects.</i>

18:51.006 --> 18:52.925
Yes, Zoreaux. Yes, good take, man.

18:52.925 --> 18:54.009
It's actually Van Damme.

18:54.009 --> 18:56.970
<i>Van Damme's been
a commanding presence, Chris.</i>

18:56.970 --> 19:00.182
<i>Just like in the movie</i>
Timecop<i>, where he does the splits twice.</i>

19:01.975 --> 19:03.602
Richmond with possession.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.648
<i>Hughes has the ball.
He's looking for space.</i>

19:07.648 --> 19:10.108
<i>It's not there. He passes back to Maas.</i>

19:10.108 --> 19:13.487
<i>No! Cooke steps in, and Brighton are off.</i>

19:14.571 --> 19:16.615
- <i>And just like that...</i>
- Fuck!

19:16.615 --> 19:18.909
- <i>...Joey Miller puts Brighton up 1-nil.</i>
- Shoot.

19:18.909 --> 19:22.746
Oh, for fuck's sake! Fucking hell!

19:22.746 --> 19:26.291
<i>Is this the beginning of the end of
Richmond's hot streak?</i>

19:27.459 --> 19:28.794
- What the fuck, bruv?
- What?

19:28.794 --> 19:30.671
- Their fucking goal's over there.
- Oh, right, yeah.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.840
Fucking fix up.
Don't fucking walk away from me.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.466
- Relax.
- Their fucking goal's over there.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.343
<i>McAdoo is furious,</i>

19:36.343 --> 19:38.178
- <i>remonstrating with Hughes for his error.</i>
- Wait? What?

19:38.178 --> 19:40.889
- Don't fucking walk away from me!
- <i>Obisanya defuses the situation,</i>

19:40.889 --> 19:42.391
- <i>but McAdoo remains incandescent.</i>
- Fuck!

19:42.391 --> 19:44.643
- We have time. Come on!
- <i>My word.</i>

19:45.435 --> 19:48.188
<i>Richmond asking
plenty of questions in the first half</i>

19:48.188 --> 19:50.983
<i>but haven't been able to put anything
into Brighton's net.</i>

19:50.983 --> 19:53.861
<i>As we enter one minute of stoppage time,</i>

19:53.861 --> 19:56.530
the Seagulls would be thrilled
to go into the locker room

19:56.530 --> 19:58.323
leading by a goal to nil.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.533
<i>Any thoughts, Chris?</i>

19:59.533 --> 20:01.326
<i>Seagulls are wretched creatures</i>

20:01.326 --> 20:03.745
<i>who'll steal your car keys
right off your beach towel.</i>

20:06.498 --> 20:07.749
<i>Richmond's starting to click.</i>

20:07.749 --> 20:11.211
<i>This is the crisp ball movement
we've come to expect from them.</i>

20:11.211 --> 20:14.381
<i>This is slick.
One-touch passing around the area.</i>

20:14.381 --> 20:15.966
<i>Rojas is in.</i>

20:16.550 --> 20:18.218
<i>Smothered by Brighton.</i>

20:20.053 --> 20:21.513
<i>And that's the half.</i>

20:21.513 --> 20:25.475
<i>Brighton's up 1-nil,
but it's still anyone's game.</i>

20:25.475 --> 20:30.898
Same old Richmond. Still a shit show.

20:32.524 --> 20:34.484
You're absolutely rubbish!

20:35.986 --> 20:39.448
Stop passing the ball around
and bloody do something!

20:40.782 --> 20:43.202
You're a disgrace to the badge!

20:43.202 --> 20:45.913
You're all playing like
a bunch of fucking fa--

20:48.332 --> 20:50.292
- What the fuck did you say to me?
- What?

20:50.876 --> 20:52.669
What did you fucking say to me?

20:53.587 --> 20:57.090
<i>Isaac McAdoo has jumped the wall
and charged into the seats.</i>

20:57.090 --> 20:58.300
<i>This is unbelievable.</i>

20:58.300 --> 20:59.259
Oh, my God.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.136
- I dare you to fucking say it again!
- <i>He appears to be</i>

21:01.136 --> 21:03.847
<i>in a confrontation with one of
the Richmond supporters.</i>

21:03.847 --> 21:05.390
Thataway, McAdoo. Get him.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.601
Hang on. He's one of ours.

21:07.601 --> 21:08.852
Say that word again!

21:09.520 --> 21:10.437
You leave it!

21:10.437 --> 21:13.023
- Say that fucking word again!
- Isaac!

21:13.023 --> 21:14.316
Number five!

21:15.108 --> 21:15.943
Fuck's sake.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.111
The captain, man.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.532
<i>It's an obvious red card.
McAdoo clearly has to go.</i>

21:22.115 --> 21:25.410
<i>Roy Kent as the voice of reason.
What a world.</i>

21:25.410 --> 21:26.912
Fuck's sakes.

21:26.912 --> 21:28.455
Good lad. Oi!

21:29.414 --> 21:30.874
Get him the fuck out of here!

21:30.874 --> 21:32.084
What?

21:32.084 --> 21:35.963
<i>After all hell broke loose,
halftime finally gets underway,</i>

21:35.963 --> 21:38.549
<i>and the Greyhounds have much to discuss.</i>

22:15.085 --> 22:17.588
All right, no one's gonna say nothing?
Sure, no, I'll kick it off.

22:17.588 --> 22:18.672
Isaac, what the hell happened?

22:19.965 --> 22:22.593
One of our fans said some ignorant shit!

22:24.178 --> 22:26.847
Okay, what'd they say?

22:30.767 --> 22:32.436
- I heard it.
- Okay.

22:32.978 --> 22:33.896
He said the f-word.

22:35.063 --> 22:37.316
- Fuck?
- No, the other f-word.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.693
Oh, fuck.

22:43.864 --> 22:46.366
If it helps, the fan has been removed.

22:47.701 --> 22:49.578
And I apologize for my dad.

22:52.289 --> 22:53.624
Sorry, not the time for jokes.

22:53.624 --> 22:55.000
Read the room, Leslie.

22:55.501 --> 22:57.753
Okay, I get it. I...

22:58.378 --> 23:02.382
Isaac, look. What that guy said?
Inexcusable. All right?

23:04.051 --> 23:05.135
But, man,

23:05.135 --> 23:09.223
your reaction to it ain't gonna be taught
in any Tibetan monasteries anytime soon.

23:09.223 --> 23:10.140
You know what I'm saying?

23:10.140 --> 23:11.683
Yeah, now we're one man down.

23:11.683 --> 23:14.561
Yeah, Isaac, come on, man.
It's nothing we haven't heard before.

23:17.606 --> 23:20.192
Exactly. It's just poopy. Ignore it, man.

23:20.734 --> 23:21.902
Ignore it?

23:22.945 --> 23:24.321
I don't want to fucking ignore it.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.033
What if one of us is gay?

23:31.703 --> 23:33.747
We shouldn't have to deal with this shit!

23:47.344 --> 23:48.345
All right.

23:48.887 --> 23:51.348
- I got it.
- Yeah.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.939
You think I should have it?

24:09.449 --> 24:12.619
No, get out, Roy.
I don't need you to come in here.

24:12.619 --> 24:14.413
Just leave me alone. Just fuck off, yeah?

24:14.413 --> 24:16.790
I fucked it up. Just fucking fuck off.
Just leave me alone.

24:16.790 --> 24:18.458
I don't need you to start yelling at me.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.252
I'm not here to yell at you.

24:28.343 --> 24:29.928
What the fuck was that all about?

24:29.928 --> 24:31.180
I don't know.

24:34.016 --> 24:35.517
Colin, do you know?

24:37.561 --> 24:39.104
Guys, it's pretty obvious.

24:39.104 --> 24:40.731
Isaac's gay, right?

24:42.816 --> 24:46.403
Well, statistically speaking,
10% of the population is homosexual.

24:46.403 --> 24:47.988
So it's not that surprising.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.451
So there are probably more people
in this room who are gay.

25:03.921 --> 25:05.130
I'm flattered.

25:06.840 --> 25:09.927
Guys, we don't need to
discuss this any further, okay?

25:09.927 --> 25:11.929
All Isaac needs now is our support.

25:11.929 --> 25:14.973
Yeah. That's our captain.

25:17.518 --> 25:19.102
All right, fellas,
let's focus on the second half.

25:19.102 --> 25:21.230
- Now, what we got--
- Hold on.

25:22.856 --> 25:23.857
Isaac's not gay.

25:27.110 --> 25:28.862
I don't know what happened out there,

25:30.447 --> 25:36.787
but I do know whatever it was
isn't what you're really angry about.

25:38.914 --> 25:39.915
Is it?

25:48.340 --> 25:49.716
So then trust me.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.637
You got to go deal with that...

25:56.473 --> 26:00.018
or you're gonna fuck up
whatever it is you actually do care about.

26:05.649 --> 26:06.817
He's right, you know.

26:11.947 --> 26:15.534
The little things we get mad about
are like snowflakes on a mountain.

26:17.411 --> 26:19.830
And if we wait too long,
then we're just one sneeze away

26:19.830 --> 26:22.457
from an avalanche that will kill us all.

26:25.669 --> 26:26.712
Thank you, Will.

26:32.009 --> 26:33.510
- You want some bubble gum?
- Don't push it.

26:44.771 --> 26:45.772
So, we cool?

26:45.772 --> 26:46.940
Of course.

26:47.816 --> 26:51.987
- Yeah.
- Of course. It's cool.

26:51.987 --> 26:54.865
- Yeah. Yes, <i>amigo</i>.
- A thousand percent.

26:54.865 --> 26:57.743
You're gay, big whoop. But we don't care.
Right, guys?

26:57.743 --> 27:01.163
- Yeah.
- All good, bro.

27:01.163 --> 27:03.248
Now, hold on, actually.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.294
Colin, we do care, you know.

27:08.337 --> 27:11.423
When I was growing up back in Kansas City,
I had a buddy named Stevey Jewell.

27:12.090 --> 27:14.051
Now, he was a huge Denver Broncos fan.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.930
But we were all growing up smack dab
in the middle of Chiefs country.

27:17.930 --> 27:20.224
So he used to catch a lot of guff for it,
you know?

27:20.224 --> 27:25.479
But me? Me, I told him it didn't affect
the way I felt about him at all, you know?

27:26.021 --> 27:28.023
I told him that I "didn't care."

27:28.607 --> 27:30.150
And I didn't, you know.

27:30.817 --> 27:34.530
But then in 19s-- what, '97, '98,

27:35.322 --> 27:39.117
he had to watch back-to-back Super Bowls
with the Denver Broncos in 'em

27:39.117 --> 27:40.202
all by himself.

27:43.163 --> 27:47.668
First one,
he ate an entire seven-layer dip

27:47.668 --> 27:50.379
from Price Chopper all by himself.

27:50.379 --> 27:53.131
Big ol' thing.
And it just wrecked his stomach.

27:53.131 --> 27:55.384
Apparently, he destroyed the toilet
in his parents' basement.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.511
I remember the rumor at the time being

27:57.511 --> 27:59.805
that he caused $9,000 worth of damage.

28:00.848 --> 28:03.016
Could you imagine? To a toilet.
9,000 bucks.

28:03.767 --> 28:06.353
The next year,
he did the exact same thing.

28:07.354 --> 28:08.689
All by himself.

28:08.689 --> 28:11.483
He must have thought it was good luck
or something. I don't know.

28:11.483 --> 28:13.819
'Cause I wasn't there.
'Cause I "didn't care."

28:15.863 --> 28:17.990
But I should've cared. You know?

28:20.117 --> 28:21.410
I should've supported him.

28:24.454 --> 28:27.791
I should've been at his house
both them years.

28:30.043 --> 28:32.337
Sharing that seven-layer dip
with my friend

28:33.589 --> 28:37.634
while his garbage-ass team wins
back-to-back Super Bowls.

28:41.680 --> 28:45.559
Coach, did you just compare being gay
to being a Denver Broncos fan?

28:46.977 --> 28:49.354
You know what? I did, and I regret it.
Yeah. Sorry about that.

28:51.190 --> 28:52.733
What the fuck are Denver Broncos?

28:52.733 --> 28:54.818
- No, that's a very good question.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

28:54.818 --> 28:57.613
It's an American football reference,
an absolute fumble in this situation.

28:57.613 --> 28:58.989
I apologize. Yeah. Okay.

28:58.989 --> 29:00.949
But the point is, Colin...

29:04.453 --> 29:06.330
we don't not care.

29:07.414 --> 29:08.707
We care very much.

29:09.499 --> 29:13.587
We care about who you are
and what you must've been going through.

29:14.838 --> 29:15.839
Yeah?

29:16.423 --> 29:18.258
But hey, from now on,

29:19.551 --> 29:22.554
you don't have to go through it
all by yourself.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.431
All right?

29:24.431 --> 29:27.809
Yeah. You hear that? You got us, mate.
We got you.

29:28.602 --> 29:31.647
Okay, well, look. Hey. I hate to
bring up work in a moment like this,

29:31.647 --> 29:33.857
but we do have
a second half of a match to play.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.025
Coach, what we got?

29:35.025 --> 29:37.903
Playing a man down.
What do we do differently?

29:37.903 --> 29:39.655
Absolutely nothing!

29:39.655 --> 29:41.740
Let's go, baby.

29:44.618 --> 29:45.869
Let's go.

29:45.869 --> 29:48.539
Okay, all right. Captain, count us off.

29:51.333 --> 29:54.169
Wow. That's me, yes. Okay.

29:55.712 --> 29:57.381
I don't know what to say.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.843
I'm honored to be your captain.

30:00.843 --> 30:03.387
And, you know,
I love you guys so very much.

30:03.387 --> 30:05.097
On three. One, two, three.

30:05.097 --> 30:06.849
I love you guys so very much!

30:19.653 --> 30:21.697
Better or worse than you imagined?

30:22.281 --> 30:24.157
Second-best way it could've gone, I think.

30:24.658 --> 30:27.870
Best way being the entire team confesses
that they're gay too,

30:27.870 --> 30:29.788
and we get to be on the cover
of Oprah's magazine.

31:04.281 --> 31:05.574
Cracking match, Coach.

31:06.158 --> 31:07.743
Yeah. Thank you, Roger.

31:08.327 --> 31:11.246
Hey, a few of us are getting a pint.
Care to join us?

31:11.246 --> 31:14.833
Sounds good but I'm actually going
for a drink with Rupert tonight.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.543
Just the two of us, so...

31:16.543 --> 31:17.920
Are you in trouble?

31:17.920 --> 31:21.548
Wh-- No. It's just like guys' night, so...

31:21.548 --> 31:23.842
Cool. Maybe next time?

31:23.842 --> 31:24.927
Yeah.

31:34.603 --> 31:36.688
- Yes!
- Yes!

31:36.688 --> 31:38.398
- <i>And Richmond have done it.</i>
- Yes!

31:38.398 --> 31:39.942
- How about that?
- Well done, sir.

31:39.942 --> 31:42.110
<i>They complete the comeback
for a thrilling two-one win...</i>

31:42.110 --> 31:44.613
- I love you so much, man.
- <i>...behind an inspirational turn</i>

31:44.613 --> 31:45.906
<i>from Colin Hughes.</i>

31:45.906 --> 31:47.574
- Come on!
- <i>Assisting both goals...</i>

31:47.574 --> 31:48.492
Yeah!

31:48.492 --> 31:50.118
<i>...in a man-of-the-match performance.</i>

31:50.118 --> 31:52.120
<i>Wow, Hughes was sensational, Arlo.</i>

31:52.120 --> 31:54.331
- <i>After being benched earlier this season...</i>

31:54.331 --> 31:56.542
- AFC Richmond!
- <i>...back in the starting lineup,</i>

31:56.542 --> 31:58.919
<i>and today, the Welshman played
like a man reborn.</i>

32:03.966 --> 32:05.926
A goal down, a man down,

32:05.926 --> 32:08.512
the Greyhounds scored twice
in the second half.

32:08.512 --> 32:11.515
Both assisted by an inspired Colin Hughes.

32:11.515 --> 32:17.396
But the real fireworks were at halftime
when Richmond's captain, Isaac McAdoo,

32:17.396 --> 32:21.441
went into the stands
to attack one of their own fans.

32:21.942 --> 32:24.611
In fairness, I wanted to do that
a few times myself, Jeff.

32:24.611 --> 32:27.614
Yeah, but you didn't, Clinton, 'cause
you're not a psychopath like McAdoo.

32:27.614 --> 32:30.576
- Now, George, you don't know what--
- Oh, no-- Jeff. Jeff, come on.

32:30.576 --> 32:33.954
You do not go into the stands.
I don't care what was said.

32:33.954 --> 32:36.999
That is a line you do not cross.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.252
And that's why McAdoo wasn't captain
when I was there.

32:40.252 --> 32:41.712
'Cause he's not fit for it.

32:41.712 --> 32:44.590
I mean, come on.
He makes Roy Kent look like Bambi.

32:45.174 --> 32:46.842
He's an idiot, isn't he? Come on.

32:46.842 --> 32:48.468
- <i>McAdoo doing that.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

32:48.468 --> 32:50.554
- <i>What was he thinking?</i>
- <i>He's in big trouble.</i>

32:50.554 --> 32:52.306
Guy probably deserved it though, right?

32:52.306 --> 32:53.640
- Absolutely.
- No doubt.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.767
I hope his kids shiv him in his sleep.

32:56.894 --> 32:58.645
What? He used to come in here.

32:58.645 --> 33:00.772
He was a dick to my niece, Claire, once.

33:00.772 --> 33:02.316
- No way.
- Not Claire.

33:02.316 --> 33:03.942
Fucking prick!

33:03.942 --> 33:05.402
<i>Moving over to east London,</i>

33:05.402 --> 33:08.739
<i>the Wonder Kid's West Ham
took care of business at home.</i>

33:14.244 --> 33:17.080
And then he came in after me.

33:18.624 --> 33:20.125
Hey, Rupert.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.002
- You all right?
- Hey, Nathan.

33:22.711 --> 33:26.423
Let me introduce Kelsie and Libby.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.883
No. The other way around.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.218
The other way.

33:30.844 --> 33:32.387
Well, I'm still Rupert.

33:33.055 --> 33:36.350
And this is Nathan Shelley,
the Wonder Kid.

33:36.934 --> 33:37.893
Hey, you all right?

33:38.519 --> 33:39.520
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:39.520 --> 33:42.523
So, the girls will be joining us tonight.

33:42.523 --> 33:43.607
Shall we?

33:47.945 --> 33:49.321
Yum, yum, yum.

33:49.947 --> 33:51.782
Thought it was a guys' night, Rupert.

33:53.575 --> 33:56.286
Well, yes. Trust me, it is.

33:57.371 --> 34:01.124
Oscar. We're off to the private room.

34:04.711 --> 34:07.005
Couple of bottles of champagne, please.

34:11.927 --> 34:12.928
Actually, Rupert.

34:14.972 --> 34:16.681
I'm so sorry, I need to leave.

34:18.766 --> 34:21.395
Long story.
I wanted to come and tell you in person.

34:35.324 --> 34:37.870
Congratulations, Ted.
That's eight wins in a row.

34:37.870 --> 34:38.954
Come on now, Trent.

34:38.954 --> 34:40.831
You know I don't care
about winning or losing.

34:43.292 --> 34:45.085
No, the truth is,
only way I could be happier

34:45.085 --> 34:47.754
is if my arm-feet were covered
in barbecue sauce.

34:48.255 --> 34:50.340
How you feeling about the win streak, Roy?

34:51.632 --> 34:54.386
No way.
Do not come near me with that shit.

34:54.386 --> 34:56.346
You never talk about a streak.

34:56.972 --> 34:59.892
My grandparents were happily married
for 51 years

34:59.892 --> 35:02.853
'cause they never said a fucking word
to each other. Scram.

35:03.604 --> 35:06.064
Well done, gentlemen. Congrats.

35:08.317 --> 35:09.318
Another one.

35:09.318 --> 35:12.988
Oh, boy. Higgins hitting us
with his DJ Khaled impression. Nice.

35:12.988 --> 35:13.947
Who?

35:13.947 --> 35:16.200
- Parallel thinking.
- Apparently so.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.702
The press is ready for you, Ted.
It's a big one.

35:19.286 --> 35:21.205
That's what that lady
from the American <i>Office</i> said.

35:21.205 --> 35:23.165
Okay, I'll be right there.

35:23.165 --> 35:24.499
Okay.

35:31.590 --> 35:33.800
- He's on his way.
- Thank you, Leslie.

35:34.760 --> 35:36.261
You gave Ted some talking points?

35:37.012 --> 35:39.264
No. I haven't done that in a long time.

35:40.599 --> 35:41.808
Oh, God.

35:59.284 --> 36:01.828
Yeah. All right. You got me today.

36:03.247 --> 36:04.373
Any questions?

36:06.416 --> 36:07.501
Fucking hell.

36:09.253 --> 36:10.796
You. Five-o'clock-shadow head.

36:10.796 --> 36:16.593
Coach Kent, do you or the organization
condone what Isaac McAdoo did today?

36:16.593 --> 36:18.345
What a stupid fucking question.

36:19.763 --> 36:21.139
Course we don't.

36:21.139 --> 36:24.643
What Isaac did was awful.
He was lucky he only got a red card.

36:24.643 --> 36:26.353
Okay. So why'd he do it?

36:43.412 --> 36:46.039
When I was first coming up
through Sunderland,

36:46.540 --> 36:49.334
there was an old-timer on the team.
Local guy.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.462
He and his wife were about to have
their first kid,

36:52.462 --> 36:54.298
so during training one day,

36:54.923 --> 36:58.760
I made a joke that, statistically,
I was probably the real dad.

36:59.845 --> 37:04.558
And the boys fell about laughing,
but he went fucking nuts.

37:04.558 --> 37:07.895
He battered me. Properly.

37:07.895 --> 37:11.607
I had a black eye, chipped tooth,
three broken ribs.

37:12.357 --> 37:14.067
I couldn't play for six games.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.320
He got booted off the team.

37:17.613 --> 37:21.074
After that, no club would go near him.

37:22.117 --> 37:24.912
Then in the summer,
after I could breathe again,

37:25.537 --> 37:27.080
I bumped into him in a pub.

37:27.873 --> 37:31.210
And I got the chance to say sorry
for my stupid fucking joke.

37:34.421 --> 37:36.089
And he got to tell me...

37:38.258 --> 37:40.260
he and his wife had lost the baby...

37:41.094 --> 37:43.263
a month before all that went down.

37:45.766 --> 37:49.853
He hadn't told anyone. Kept it all inside.

37:56.568 --> 38:00.656
Look, I get that some people think
if they buy a ticket,

38:01.156 --> 38:05.577
they've got the right to yell whatever
abusive shit they want at footballers.

38:06.703 --> 38:10.832
But they're not just footballers.
They're also people.

38:12.709 --> 38:17.798
And none of us know
what is going on in each other's lives.

38:20.884 --> 38:24.888
So for Isaac to do what he did today,

38:25.806 --> 38:27.099
even though it was wrong...

38:29.810 --> 38:31.061
I give him love.

38:35.274 --> 38:37.568
And as for why he did what he did...

38:41.613 --> 38:43.740
that's none of my fucking business.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.121
Next question.

38:50.122 --> 38:51.331
Yeah, New Trent.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.126
Coach, let's talk about Colin Hughes.

38:54.877 --> 38:57.212
Yeah, he's a hell of a player
and a great man.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.423
I think we've underused him.

38:59.423 --> 39:01.300
- I think you're right.
- Glad we agree.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.218
I prefer you to Old Trent.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.137
Next question.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.312
You. Goblin King, go.

39:33.373 --> 39:34.249
Hey.

39:35.334 --> 39:36.335
Hey.

39:36.919 --> 39:38.378
What happened to guys' night?

40:09.993 --> 40:10.994
Hey.

40:15.499 --> 40:16.875
You lied to me.

40:19.336 --> 40:20.337
For years.

40:24.132 --> 40:27.886
What is it about me
that made you think you couldn't tell me?

40:29.888 --> 40:31.974
No, it was nothing to do with you.

40:32.975 --> 40:34.268
It was about me.

40:36.562 --> 40:39.231
I was 99% sure that you'd support me.

40:39.815 --> 40:44.736
But the 1% chance that you wouldn't
scared the shit out of me.

40:51.118 --> 40:54.580
I don't know how you did it.
I can't keep a secret for shit.

40:54.580 --> 40:57.207
I know. Another reason I didn't tell you.

40:57.791 --> 41:00.043
I mean, I hid it from people for years,

41:00.586 --> 41:03.630
and the second you find out,
I didn't last a month.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.180
I'm sorry, bruv.

41:14.683 --> 41:15.934
You gonna tell everyone now?

41:19.229 --> 41:20.230
No.

41:21.231 --> 41:23.984
The team knows. And that's enough for me.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.528
And no one's gonna say shit.

41:29.781 --> 41:30.782
I promise.

41:37.039 --> 41:38.165
Wanna come in?

41:44.463 --> 41:45.464
Yeah, all right.

41:46.507 --> 41:47.341
Come on.

42:01.897 --> 42:05.484
Is "top or bottom"
sex positions or sleeping arrangements?

42:05.984 --> 42:07.277
Sexual positions.

42:07.277 --> 42:09.154
Unless bunk beds are involved.
Then it's both.

42:09.821 --> 42:11.240
Would you ever shag a woman?

42:11.240 --> 42:12.616
No, I'm gay.

42:12.616 --> 42:14.701
I know, but what if you had to?

42:15.494 --> 42:18.247
- 1967 Raquel Welch.
- My man.

42:19.331 --> 42:22.918
- Who's the fittest guy on the team?
- I won't tell you, and you'd never guess.

42:24.086 --> 42:25.879
- Bumbercatch.
- Yes.

42:27.422 --> 42:29.299
What about team showers?
How does that work?

42:29.299 --> 42:31.927
I keep my head down,
and I think of global warming.

42:32.469 --> 42:34.930
Yeah, well, if I had to shower
with a bunch of girls all the time,

42:34.930 --> 42:36.431
I'd defo get boners.

42:39.810 --> 42:40.811
I love you, boyo.

42:44.106 --> 42:45.524
You can't say it, can you?

42:47.568 --> 42:48.569
No.

42:49.820 --> 42:50.904
But you know I do, yeah?
