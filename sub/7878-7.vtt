00:36.444 --> 00:39.913
Superior Court of Langley Falls,
Jury Service.

00:39.981 --> 00:40.981
Morning, Olivia.

00:41.049 --> 00:42.082
It's Stan Smith.

00:42.150 --> 00:43.450
Oh, hi, Stan.

00:43.518 --> 00:45.052
Has it been a
year already?

00:45.120 --> 00:46.286
To the day.

00:46.354 --> 00:48.088
Did you get the self-addressed
stamped envelope

00:48.156 --> 00:49.456
I sent for my jury summons?

00:49.524 --> 00:50.457
Mm-hmm.

00:52.393 --> 00:54.461
I'm ready to be back
in the jury pool.

00:54.529 --> 00:56.497
I hope the water's warm.
I hope the water's warm.

00:56.564 --> 00:58.398
Let me see
what we got.

00:58.466 --> 01:00.601
I can put you on a
multiple felony trial

01:00.668 --> 01:01.802
that starts tomorrow.

01:01.870 --> 01:03.303
Olivia, you're guilty.

01:03.371 --> 01:04.905
Of making my day.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.410
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:10.478 --> 01:11.878
If you have no objections.

01:14.716 --> 01:16.483
It's me. I had
to stop that.

01:16.551 --> 01:18.352
What is it with
you and jury duty?

01:18.419 --> 01:20.087
Jury duty is the best way

01:20.155 --> 01:22.422
for honest citizens
to punish lawbreakers.

01:22.490 --> 01:23.791
It's a waste of time.

01:23.858 --> 01:25.526
Like getting
an HIV test.

01:25.593 --> 01:27.294
Roll the dice,
scaredy-cats!

01:27.362 --> 01:29.596
Hey, I happen to know
at least 20 of your personas

01:29.664 --> 01:30.998
have social security numbers.

01:31.065 --> 01:32.800
You must get called in
for jury duty.

01:32.867 --> 01:35.836
I do. Want to see what I do
with the letters they send me?

01:35.904 --> 01:38.205
The jury letters
are just the top layer.

01:38.273 --> 01:41.008
Underneath are my parking
tickets and alimony statements.

01:41.075 --> 01:42.876
All those bitches can starve.

01:42.944 --> 01:44.645
You just do whatever
you want, don't you?

01:44.712 --> 01:45.846
Pretty much, bro.

01:45.914 --> 01:47.581
I do what I want, when I want.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.615
Exhibit A.

01:50.451 --> 01:53.287
I see you're admiring
my special Austrian toilet.

01:53.354 --> 01:55.122
Very powerful suction.

01:55.190 --> 01:57.257
I like to clean my crack
with your undershirts,

01:57.325 --> 01:59.560
so I need a crapper
that can suck them down.

01:59.627 --> 02:02.596
One day you'll have to face the
consequences of your actions.

02:02.664 --> 02:03.864
No, I won't.

02:03.932 --> 02:05.332
People forgive you
if you're likable,

02:05.400 --> 02:08.101
and I'm the most charming S.O.B.
anyone's ever met.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.871
Face it, I'm Ferris Bueller
and you're my jealous,

02:10.939 --> 02:12.840
big-nosed, sour-faced
sister Jeanie.

02:12.907 --> 02:13.841
I am not Jeanie.

02:13.908 --> 02:14.808
Sure you are.

02:14.876 --> 02:16.009
Now watch this.

02:19.247 --> 02:20.347
Look at that.

02:20.415 --> 02:22.115
Took my nipple clamps, too.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.318
Had those twisted on
pretty tight.

02:26.054 --> 02:27.788
It's going to be so much fun

02:27.856 --> 02:29.590
having you two
living in the house.

02:29.657 --> 02:32.759
And I want to formally
welcome Jeff to our home.

02:32.827 --> 02:35.429
Thanks, Mrs. S.

02:35.496 --> 02:37.064
House rules?

02:37.131 --> 02:40.601
Unfortunately, there's a stern
side to the welcome basket.

02:40.668 --> 02:42.236
"No smoking pot"?

02:42.303 --> 02:43.904
Mom, Jeff needs it.

02:43.972 --> 02:45.405
He's got a
prescription.

02:45.473 --> 02:47.674
He has a compulsive disorder
that could get really bad

02:47.742 --> 02:48.976
if he goes off
his medication.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.044
Oh, shut up, Hayley;
that's not true.

02:51.112 --> 02:54.147
Look, it's not even my rule,
it's your dad's.

02:54.215 --> 02:56.717
You think I wouldn't like
to spark up a doober

02:56.784 --> 02:58.218
every now and again?

02:58.286 --> 03:02.589
Just take a nice, slow,
extra-careful drive.

03:02.657 --> 03:04.458
But, Mom...

03:04.525 --> 03:06.360
It's okay, Hayley,
I can handle it.

03:06.427 --> 03:08.829
I mean, weed's the thing
I care about the most,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.664
but maybe
that should be you.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.865
Oh...

03:11.933 --> 03:13.667
Thanks, Jeff.

03:13.735 --> 03:17.371
Man, you got me
thinking about weed now.

03:17.438 --> 03:20.507
That stuff makes me
want to drink so much soda.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.810
I smoke a bone, then I drain
a two-liter of Sunkist

03:23.878 --> 03:25.178
in, like, a second.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.446
Freaks people out.

03:28.000 --> 03:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:35.623 --> 03:36.623
What time is it?

03:36.691 --> 03:37.991
It's 6:00 a.m.

03:38.059 --> 03:40.661
I'm checking into a motel
then reporting to jury duty.

03:40.728 --> 03:43.363
You don't always have to
sequester yourself, you know.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.898
Yes, I do, Francine.

03:44.966 --> 03:47.901
I need to be in a media blackout
so I don't compromise the trial.

03:47.969 --> 03:49.736
Now, while I'm gone,
I need you to manage

03:49.804 --> 03:51.371
my fantasy basketball team.

03:51.439 --> 03:53.006
Can I make
any trades?

03:53.074 --> 03:54.474
No. Just set the lineup.

03:54.542 --> 03:56.376
Stan, you need
a power forward.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.577
I have Dirk Nowitzki.

03:57.645 --> 03:58.745
He's soft, Stan.

03:58.813 --> 03:59.846
You need a thug.

03:59.914 --> 04:01.148
You need Ron Artest.

04:01.215 --> 04:02.282
I don't want Ron Artest.

04:02.350 --> 04:03.450
You know what, forget it.

04:03.518 --> 04:05.752
I'll have Steve set my lineup.

04:05.820 --> 04:06.920
Fine.

04:06.988 --> 04:09.189
Let that nerd set your lineup.

04:09.257 --> 04:11.158
Watch you lose.

04:17.665 --> 04:19.565
You, uh, want
the Metro Section?

04:19.634 --> 04:20.801
Thanks.

04:20.868 --> 04:22.903
You trying to expose me
to the news?!

04:22.971 --> 04:25.138
Force a mistrial?
Who do you work for?

04:25.206 --> 04:26.940
<i>Young Man's Fancy!</i>
What?

04:27.008 --> 04:30.477
It's a formal-wear boutique
for style-conscious preteens!

04:30.545 --> 04:31.912
I'm sorry!

04:33.214 --> 04:35.082
Before your jury service begins,

04:35.149 --> 04:36.950
please watch this short video.

04:38.252 --> 04:40.487
Hi. I'm Judd Nelson,

04:40.555 --> 04:43.523
star of the 1987
courtroom comedy <i>From the Hip.</i>

04:43.591 --> 04:46.860
Maybe you remember the scene
where I did Jell-O shots

04:46.928 --> 04:49.363
off of Elizabeth Perkins
tight buns.

04:49.430 --> 04:52.966
Oh, wait...
that happened in <i>real</i> life.

04:53.034 --> 04:55.402
Anyway, every American's
got the right to a trial

04:55.470 --> 04:57.237
by a jury of his peers.

04:57.305 --> 05:00.874
The first step to any trial
is jury selection.

05:00.942 --> 05:03.076
It's a lot like
an acting audition.

05:03.144 --> 05:05.979
I used to hate them, but...
now I'd kill for one.

05:06.047 --> 05:09.683
I mean... just murder someone.

05:11.552 --> 05:13.120
Sir, is there
any reason

05:13.187 --> 05:15.155
you couldn't
serve on this jury?

05:15.223 --> 05:18.525
I'd love to; I just don't
have regular child care.

05:18.593 --> 05:21.094
The prosecution
dismisses juror four.

05:21.162 --> 05:23.196
Hang on a second.

05:23.264 --> 05:24.564
Aah!
Liar!

05:24.632 --> 05:26.433
What if that had been
a real baby?!

05:26.501 --> 05:28.735
Sometimes it is.

05:28.803 --> 05:31.071
Congratulations
to you all

05:31.139 --> 05:33.907
for being selected
as the jury in this case.

05:33.975 --> 05:36.009
Have you selected
a foreman?

05:36.077 --> 05:38.645
I would like to nominate
myself as jury foreman.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.814
Your Honor, I love the law,

05:40.882 --> 05:42.816
and I <i>love</i> justice,

05:42.884 --> 05:45.886
and I will do anything,
even die, to preserve them.

05:45.953 --> 05:48.255
How many of you
can read?

05:50.258 --> 05:52.225
Eh...

05:52.293 --> 05:53.960
no.

05:54.028 --> 05:55.962
Okay, you're foreman.

06:01.002 --> 06:02.936
Oh, I hope it's
still in the toilet.

06:03.004 --> 06:05.772
I don't know who left it,
but it is crazy big!

06:05.840 --> 06:08.508
It's sticking out of the
water like a shipwreck!

06:10.845 --> 06:11.912
Jeff!

06:11.979 --> 06:13.346
What the hell, man!

06:13.414 --> 06:15.082
I-I thought everyone was out.

06:15.149 --> 06:16.416
You have
got to lock

06:16.484 --> 06:18.018
the freaking door, dude!
I'm sorry,

06:18.086 --> 06:21.054
but when I'm not smoking pot,
I suffer from HLS,

06:21.122 --> 06:23.123
Hyperactive Libido Syndrome.

06:23.191 --> 06:26.426
When it hits, I got
to get busy right away.

06:26.494 --> 06:28.128
If you're gonna do
<i>that</i> in this house,

06:28.196 --> 06:30.730
you'll do it where everyone
else in this family does it:

06:30.798 --> 06:32.232
in Steve's bed!

06:32.300 --> 06:33.533
What?!

06:33.601 --> 06:36.002
Today we will be hearing

06:36.070 --> 06:39.306
the case of
<i>The People v. Martin Sugar.</i>

06:39.373 --> 06:42.609
Mr. Sugar is accused of
manufacturing and distributing

06:42.677 --> 06:45.612
millions of dollars' worth
of counterfeit handbags.

06:45.680 --> 06:47.814
Please bring in the defendant.

06:47.882 --> 06:49.983
Justice time!

07:03.131 --> 07:04.931
Hi...!

07:04.999 --> 07:07.267
It's me, Roger.

07:07.335 --> 07:09.736
Stan. <i>Stan.</i>

07:09.804 --> 07:12.305
Just-just look over here,
just for a sec. Stan.

07:13.608 --> 07:15.775
Hi...!

07:20.556 --> 07:22.957
Throughout this trial,
we will present evidence

07:23.025 --> 07:25.093
against the defendant,

07:25.161 --> 07:28.263
showing how truly despicable
his crimes were.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.764
In addition

07:29.832 --> 07:32.567
to the counterfeiting,
he subjected illegal workers

07:32.635 --> 07:35.136
to inhumane work conditions.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.739
This man is a threat to society.

07:37.806 --> 07:41.142
He is a menace, and he
must pay for his crimes.

07:41.210 --> 07:43.912
I will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt

07:43.979 --> 07:46.981
that Martin Sugar
deserves to be behind bars.

Would the defense like

08:08.621 --> 08:11.272
I'll be speaking on behalf
of my attorney, Your Honor.

08:11.340 --> 08:14.576
This is Bert Faber, and he's
been my lawyer for 20 years.

08:14.643 --> 08:17.245
Recently Bert survived a lengthy
battle with throat cancer,

08:17.313 --> 08:18.980
and it claimed
his voice box.

08:19.048 --> 08:20.815
But I won't fire him.

08:20.883 --> 08:23.484
He's family-- and you don't
abandon your family!

08:23.552 --> 08:25.853
Did you hear that?
What a stand-up guy.

08:25.921 --> 08:29.524
Eh, so I am definitely
not on trial here?

08:29.592 --> 08:31.426
Does anyone
have a lozenge?

08:31.493 --> 08:33.828
Bert's throat gets
so dry these days.

08:33.895 --> 08:35.730
I knew you'd have one.

08:35.798 --> 08:38.600
You're clearly a mother--
you have kind eyes.

08:38.667 --> 08:39.933
Aw...

08:40.001 --> 08:40.969
Yes.

08:52.815 --> 08:53.982
(screams

08:54.049 --> 08:56.084
Oh, Jeff, come on!

08:56.151 --> 08:58.353
We keep the food in there!

08:58.420 --> 09:00.521
Sorry, I was
just getting a snack,

09:00.589 --> 09:03.591
then I noticed the maple syrup
lady looks like Ashanti,

09:03.659 --> 09:06.160
and I told you,
I can't control myself!

09:06.228 --> 09:07.929
Frannie, can you grab
me the saltines?

09:07.997 --> 09:09.330
Aah, oh, dude!

09:09.398 --> 09:11.299
Oh, you are killing me!

09:11.367 --> 09:12.567
Ugh!

09:12.635 --> 09:14.168
Frannie,
the canned goods

09:14.236 --> 09:17.238
are probably all right, but
I-I'd toss everything else.

09:17.306 --> 09:23.411
The prosecution would now like
to call Mr. Sugar to the stand.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.847
Guess who's the luckiest guy
in the courtroom?

09:25.914 --> 09:28.549
Bert, 'cause he gets
to watch my big round ass

09:28.617 --> 09:30.285
as I walk
to the stand.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.358
Mr. Sugar,
how do you explain

09:37.426 --> 09:38.960
this photo of you

09:39.028 --> 09:43.264
with illegal employees
and counterfeit merchandise?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.633
You know what's <i>not</i>
counterfeit in that photo?

09:45.701 --> 09:47.001
My emotions.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.403
Aw...

09:48.470 --> 09:50.672
Okay. I don't know
what that means.

09:50.739 --> 09:53.174
But here you are
accepting a cash payment

09:53.242 --> 09:54.876
for the fake handbags.

09:54.943 --> 09:57.845
Do you admit
that this is you?!

09:57.913 --> 10:00.548
I will... if you
admit <i>this</i> is you.

10:02.318 --> 10:04.218
Wh-Wha...
H-How did you...

10:12.895 --> 10:15.997
Gosh, she looked good
before the baby.

10:18.267 --> 10:20.568
Mr. Sugar made us work very hard.

10:20.636 --> 10:24.372
When we weren't sewing handbags,
he made us sleep on the floor.

10:26.442 --> 10:28.776
Inez... thank you.

10:30.379 --> 10:33.881
Inez, does the date September
19th mean anything to you?

10:33.949 --> 10:35.249
<i>Es mi cumpleanos.</i>

10:35.317 --> 10:37.418
In English, please.
It is my birthday.

10:37.486 --> 10:39.320
Can you tell me
what this is, Inez?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.491
It is the bear you gave
me for my birthday.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.859
Aw...

10:44.927 --> 10:47.662
So, if I was the monster
the prosecution is trying

10:47.730 --> 10:50.164

would I have given you

10:50.232 --> 10:52.066
such a wonderful
birthday present?

10:52.134 --> 10:54.135
No.

11:03.879 --> 11:05.813
Oh-Oh. Yeah.

11:08.684 --> 11:11.185
Look, I'm jury foreman
and no one leaves here

11:11.253 --> 11:12.754
until we come
to a unanimous decision.

11:12.821 --> 11:14.255
We're unanimous.

11:14.323 --> 11:16.557
You're the only douchebag
who thinks he's guilty.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.459
Didn't you people see
all the evidence?

11:18.527 --> 11:21.229
He makes pregnant women
on the assembly line give birth

11:21.296 --> 11:22.697
and then get right back to work!

11:22.765 --> 11:25.466
That's why he built the
Martin Sugar Day Care Center.

11:25.534 --> 11:28.102
It's an overturned refrigerator
filled with kitty litter!

11:28.170 --> 11:29.337
Look, we just like him.

11:29.405 --> 11:30.905
Let's let him go.

11:30.973 --> 11:32.640
No! If he committed
these crimes,

11:32.708 --> 11:34.108
then he has to pay the price!

11:34.176 --> 11:35.576
I don't know.

11:35.644 --> 11:37.412
I think about
all the people he ripped off,

11:37.479 --> 11:40.047
but then I think about
how funny and handsome he is

11:40.115 --> 11:41.749
and I just want
to sit on his .

11:41.817 --> 11:43.718
I think we need to take
another look at the evidence.

11:49.057 --> 11:50.425
Hey. It's me.

Martin Sugar,

12:11.146 --> 12:13.648
you have been found guilty
on all counts.

let us go home!

12:17.686 --> 12:19.120
I'll visit you

12:19.188 --> 12:22.623
You are sentenced to ten years
in maximum security prison.

But, Mom, I satisfy
