WEBVTT

01:31.049 --> 01:32.630
Oh, shit.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.713
Duffy split.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.796
Yeah, wasn't that Duffy?

01:38.890 --> 01:41.131
Duffy rolls outta here
in a brand new Cadillac.

01:41.268 --> 01:45.181
The lad has the nerve to ask me to clean
up his fucking locker and save it for him.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.354
Probably has dirty
pictures of his wife.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.272
I don't know what
the fuck is in here.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.606
Uh-huh.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.692
He does have dirty
pictures of his wife.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.027
Yes. He does.

02:02.122 --> 02:05.034
Lucky man. Look at her hoofers.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.366
You like that, huh?

02:07.461 --> 02:10.874
All right. This is
what I'm gonna do.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.670
I'm gonna keep them.

02:12.758 --> 02:15.090
Well, no, I gotta answer
to Duffy for that.

02:15.177 --> 02:16.542
I'll answer to him.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.719
He is a duffus but
he's not a bad guy.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.798
Fuck Duffy. Just fuck him.
Fuck all of them.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.306
Five copies of an arrest report.

02:27.439 --> 02:31.398
If the prisoner was transported, there
wouldn't still be five copies here.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.568
Duffy might've left him downstairs.
What's his name? Chavez.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.646
Let's go find him.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.279
Who's there?

02:47.125 --> 02:50.583
It's strange, 'cause the manifest
says the prisoners all evacuated.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.707
Anything's possible
in this storm.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.210
I feel a bet coming on.
Shall we open the casino?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.585
Please.

02:56.677 --> 03:00.044
All right. Up to
his nose by 4:00.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.220
What the fuck fook you so long, man?
Please.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.093
Please what, shitbird?

03:04.184 --> 03:06.425
Gel me the fuck outta here, man.
The waler's rising.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.728
It's been rising for like three hours.
It's already up to my neck.

03:09.856 --> 03:14.691
I'm not gonna be able to stay here long,
man. I'll drown. The water doesn't stop.

03:14.820 --> 03:19.189
Get me the fuck outta here. There's
fucking snakes and shit in this water.

03:19.282 --> 03:24.072
Twenty bucks and the polaroid
he says nothing before five.

03:24.204 --> 03:28.322
Twenty bucks. What the fuck is that? Let's
make it worth our while, at least. A dime.

03:28.417 --> 03:30.157
I'm not betting you $1,000.

03:30.252 --> 03:31.833
Five hundred.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.083
Get me the fuck outta here, man!
The water keeps rising.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.164
Two hundred and the polaroids.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.499
Please, motherfuckers.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.630
Please what, shit turd?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.839
Got a broke leg. Please,
get me out of here.

03:44.933 --> 03:49.142
Wait a minute. You want me fo
get welt on account of you?

03:49.229 --> 03:51.140
Think the world
owes you a living, huh?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.471
[Ll drown.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.978
Hey, man, I got on
Swiss cotton underpants.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.775
Yeah, that's right.
Cost me $55 a pair.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.980
You think I wanna get all this
brown water and shit all over?

04:01.074 --> 04:02.314
That don't come out.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.650
You got underwear on
that cost $55?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.827
My girl gave them to me.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.118
Come on, we get the time
of death from autopsy.

04:15.839 --> 04:16.839
What are you doing?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.584
Hold this.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.250
Oh, come on, man.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.177
Let the fire department get him out.
What are you, crazy?

04:24.264 --> 04:26.129
He ain't worth it!

04:26.224 --> 04:28.431
Come on, man.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.009
You are crazy.

04:33.148 --> 04:37.187
You okay, man? You okay?

04:39.738 --> 04:43.401
The good news, Terence, is I'll
okay you to return to full duty.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.528
The bad news is
that in all likely

04:45.619 --> 04:49.828
you'll be experiencing
moderate to severe back pain.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.451
How severe?

04:51.541 --> 04:53.873
You'll wanna be taking
something for it.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.873
Gonna write you a
prescription for Vicodin.

04:57.964 --> 04:59.454
For how long?

04:59.549 --> 05:00.709
From now on.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.713
No. For how long
am I gonna have pain?

05:03.804 --> 05:06.216
We're gonna try to manage
this as along as we can.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.796
For the rest of my life?

05:07.891 --> 05:11.383
Probably. But they're making
advancements every day, so,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.719
just work with me
on this, all right?

05:13.814 --> 05:17.352
Now, when this runs
out, call the office.

05:23.365 --> 05:27.074
Thank you for helping me honor
our fallen heroes today.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.402
We will now move on to the

Are they pulling
security cameras?

Yeah.

From what we know,

09:39.079 --> 09:44.369
dauta had been dealing heroin to
supplement his income as a peddler.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.246
Now, I want every drug dealer,

09:47.337 --> 09:50.124
every junkie within
a five-mile radius

09:50.215 --> 09:53.457
hassled into giving up
who his supplier was.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.291
Due to the nature of this crime,

09:55.386 --> 09:58.219
you've got full authorization
for overtime if you need it.

09:58.306 --> 10:01.343
Lieutenant McDonagh's gonna be
heading up the investigation,

10:01.434 --> 10:03.174
so coordinate with him.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.011
That's it. Let's
see some results.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.939
McDonagh, see you in my
office for a minute.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.524
You up to this?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.701
Why wouldn't I be?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.370
I know you're still having
problems with your back.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.698
Dealing with being in
pain a lot of the time.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.374
I'm managing.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.577
You still taking
medication for it?

10:31.756 --> 10:34.418
Only what the doctor prescribes.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.673
Ordinarily there'd be somebody
with more time on the job

10:38.763 --> 10:40.674
handling this kind
of investigation.

10:40.765 --> 10:44.053
But I'm gonna go out on a limb with
you 'cause you got good instincts

10:44.144 --> 10:46.476
and do nothing' but work.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.851
But if I find that you needed
help and didn't ask for it,

10:49.941 --> 10:51.806
I will be mad.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.732
Yes, sir.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.651
How is your old man doing?

10:55.738 --> 10:59.777
He's drinking himself
into an early grave.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.278
Give him my best, would you?

11:01.369 --> 11:02.609
I will.

11:02.704 --> 11:07.073
Lieutenant, no more
unnecessary jumps, huh?

11:07.167 --> 11:09.078
Yes, sir.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.599
Good morning, Mr. McDonagh.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.035
Hi, honey.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.167

You're out already?

11:58.593 --> 12:00.424
Yes.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.143

You need to call him back?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.169
No.

12:41.261 --> 12:44.674
You know I'd rather go
to the monteleone with you.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.050
I can't afford it.

12:47.141 --> 12:50.429
I can. I can afford it.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.695
Yeah?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.530
Who brought him in?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.661
That's who's questioning him?

13:17.088 --> 13:19.579
I'll be there in ten minutes.
Tell him I'm on my way.

13:19.674 --> 13:23.007
Tell him if he puts his hands on
this guy, he's gonna have a problem.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.220
I don't give a shit, Armand. You
tell him to take a fucking break!

13:27.307 --> 13:31.300
Excuse me. Could you tell me how
much longer that's gonna be?

13:31.394 --> 13:34.511
Hello, miss? I'm a lieutenant
in the police department.

13:34.605 --> 13:37.017
I'm in the middle of
a homicide investigation.

13:37.108 --> 13:39.394
Can I get my
prescription, please?

13:39.485 --> 13:42.227
Do you see I'm on the phone?

13:43.573 --> 13:45.359
Hey, you can't come back here.

13:45.491 --> 13:49.029
You got me waiting 40 minutes so you
can make a fuck personal phone call!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.997

Security to pharmacy, please.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.076
This is it. This is it.
Police emergency.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.581
You're no cop.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.787
What's that look like?

14:00.882 --> 14:03.874
Why are you acting
all crazy for?

14:03.968 --> 14:06.755
This is, uh, $23

14:06.846 --> 14:09.212
There's 40. Give
everybody a drink.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.468
Get the fuck out of my way.

14:13.519 --> 14:16.101
Dob, look at me.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.180
Okay?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.230
Two hours. That's enough.

14:20.318 --> 14:23.310
Tell me something I don't know.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.110
Man, you gofia

14:25.198 --> 14:26.734
Gel you outta here?

14:26.824 --> 14:29.406
I got you on possession.
You're on parole.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.780
Maybe but one skinny ass joint.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.078
That joint's gonna get you back.

14:34.165 --> 14:36.451
I've got five dead people, man.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.622
You understand?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.291
I don't know nothin' about it.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.244
Tell me something.

14:41.339 --> 14:43.250
What do you want me to tell you?

14:43.383 --> 14:46.671
I want you to tell me something I haven't
heard. I don't want you to tell me,

14:46.803 --> 14:49.886
look at me, I don't want you to tell
me that you don't know nothing.

14:49.972 --> 14:52.509
But I don't know nothing.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.465
Did you tell him what I said?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.175
You understand what that means?

14:56.270 --> 15:00.058
I'm entitled to whatever
I want in this room.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.391
That means Guantanamo bay. You
believe this motherfucker?

15:03.486 --> 15:07.149
I've busted my ass for yambos
and this yambo tell me shit.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.697
Detective, can I see you
outside for a second?

15:09.784 --> 15:13.242
Uh, yeah, sure. Two minutes.

15:13.329 --> 15:15.069
Think about it.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.285
Uh, not a great time
to take a break.

15:18.376 --> 15:19.376
What are you doing?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.659
He's about to go.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.368
Bullshit. He's scared
out of his mind.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.129
You and your partner made a
spectacle out of picking him up.

15:25.216 --> 15:28.128
Everyone in central city knows
he's in here. No, just shush.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.003
You think he's gonna go out if you
keep insulting him like that?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.258
You trying to tell me
how to do my interrogation?

15:33.349 --> 15:36.182
Yes. I'm gonna tell you when
you're doing something wrong.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.351
Go fuck yourself.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.225
I'm gonna treat
you respectfully.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.476
You treat me respectfully.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.692
I'm looking at some bullshit pot busting.
Because you're on parole

15:46.779 --> 15:49.270
you wind up back in Angola.
Why would you do that?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.481
I ain't the one doing it.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.692
Who did have kingard piss off?

15:53.786 --> 15:56.744
I never said two words to him.
I don't know.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.618
But you knew he was selling dope.
Come on.

16:01.669 --> 16:06.208
Shall I call your parole officer?
Stop wasting my time.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.085
I knew he was selling.

16:08.217 --> 16:12.426
Okay. Tell me where he was selling,
whose neighborhood was it.

16:12.513 --> 16:16.051
Man, look. I got me a good
job at a cleaning service.

16:16.142 --> 16:18.349
I check in when I'm supposed to.

16:18.436 --> 16:20.722
I smoke a little
weed, but that's it.

16:20.813 --> 16:24.146
Tell me whose
neighborhood it was, dob.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.107
Man.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.617
You know fate?

16:36.704 --> 16:39.446
Big fate? Yeah.

16:39.540 --> 16:44.955
Ain't nothin' moved that part of town.
He ain't got a piece of it.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.253
Where can I find him?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.957
Shit. I'm saying all I know.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.795
If you want me to lead you to
him, you well just lock me up.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.272
Check Stevie's arrest
report on dob.

17:07.359 --> 17:10.271
If it mentions marijuana,
make sure it gets lost.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.103
What do I tell Stevie?

17:12.198 --> 17:13.938
You can tell him
to go fuck himself.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.150
I'm gonna go upstairs and
crash an hour in the crib.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.181
What do you want, mundt?

17:48.859 --> 17:52.272
Internal affairs is checking
the property room vouchers.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.819
So?

17:53.906 --> 17:56.488
That means they're gonna
find out the shit missing.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.567
Not if you don't
tell them, they won't.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.904
I can't do it anymore, Terence.

18:06.335 --> 18:08.576
Oh, fuck.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.421
I'm-i"'m really sorry.
I just can't.

18:16.512 --> 18:18.844
Mundt,

18:18.931 --> 18:22.094
whatever drugs might've been
taken out of the property room,

18:23.436 --> 18:26.269
you will have a
voucher, you understand?

18:26.397 --> 18:30.857
They won't turn up as missing, 'cause
there's no record of them being there

18:30.943 --> 18:34.356
in the first place, okay?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.813
They're installing cameras.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.776
So then you don't do anything

18:41.871 --> 18:46.205
where the cameras can see you.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.998
I can't.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.248
When it was me doing paperwork
to cover the cash you misplaced,

18:51.339 --> 18:54.297
that was all right. That was
entirely fucking reasonable.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.294
I'm sorry.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.418
Hey, mundt.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.963
Hey, mundt?

19:44.058 --> 19:46.219
You bad boy.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.815
Oh, yeah.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.854
Stand against the wall.

19:59.949 --> 20:03.157
Come on! Stand against the wall.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.155
You're too busy making
out with your girlfriend

20:05.246 --> 20:07.206
you don't know when you've
done something illegal?

20:07.248 --> 20:08.738
What are we hiding tonight?

20:08.833 --> 20:09.868
Nothing.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.824
You passed drugs in that club?

20:11.919 --> 20:13.705
No.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.630
The two of you match a description.
Empty your pockets and the handbag.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.923
Why?

20:19.009 --> 20:20.965
I said you match a description.

20:21.053 --> 20:23.465
Somebody seen passing drugs.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.093
I wasn't passing drugs.
What does that even mean?

20:26.225 --> 20:29.809
Empty your pockets. Dump out the handbag.
I'm not gonna tell you again.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.227
This is bullshit!

20:32.314 --> 20:34.726
Just do what he says, okay?

20:34.817 --> 20:36.478
What you got there?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.184
Nothing.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.361
I'm not gonna get stuck, am 1?

20:40.448 --> 20:41.813
No.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.114
I get stuck, I'm gonna
be very fucking angry.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.237
You're not gonna get stuck.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.570
Where's your badge
if you're a cop?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.659
This is what I'm looking for.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.837
Here's where it says I'm a cop.

20:57.923 --> 21:02.337
Sir, it-it's obviously
just for personal use.

21:02.428 --> 21:03.668
I mean, I'm not a dealer.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.345
That's for the da to decide.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.595
You're gonna dump that
bag or I gotta do it?

21:12.062 --> 21:16.226
Sir, is-is there any way my parents
don't have to find out about this?

21:16.317 --> 21:18.854
I mean, can we, can
we just handle this?

21:18.944 --> 21:22.107
I'll go to jail on weekends or something
like that if I have fo do thal.

21:22.198 --> 21:25.565
My father has a
heart condition, okay?

21:27.244 --> 21:31.032
This would kill him. Please.
Just let me keep this from him.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.364
You think he want might to know?

21:33.459 --> 21:37.953
Yeah. I'd wanna know
if you were my child.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.049
Here.

21:44.136 --> 21:48.220
This fur is nothing, but
this is my grandmother's.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.925
It's worth $60,000.

21:52.019 --> 21:54.635
You can give it
to your girlfriend.

21:54.730 --> 21:56.561
If you don't have a girlfriend,

21:56.649 --> 21:58.560
you can give it to your mother.

21:58.651 --> 22:00.232
It's bribery.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.604
Excuse me!

22:01.695 --> 22:04.903
This is worth $60,000.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.357
Doesn't that get us passed?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.693
Where's the rock?

22:10.788 --> 22:13.621
Come on, come on,
who's got the kibble?

22:15.668 --> 22:16.668
You wanna hit?

22:16.752 --> 22:18.288
Yes.

22:34.728 --> 22:37.891
Jesus Christ.

22:37.982 --> 22:39.438
Again.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.390
Yeah?

22:47.283 --> 22:49.865
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:07.094 --> 23:10.962
This what's gonna take? Yeah?

23:11.056 --> 23:13.513
You're worried about
your father finding out?

23:13.601 --> 23:14.807
No.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.179
What about your mother?

23:16.270 --> 23:18.636
I don't give a shit
about anyone of them.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.346
Did they beat you?

23:20.441 --> 23:21.897
No.

23:21.984 --> 23:23.645
Molest you?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.397
No.

23:25.487 --> 23:28.320
Didn't buy you any clothes
back to school, huh?

23:28.407 --> 23:32.491
Didn't see you in the
high school play, huh?

23:32.578 --> 23:35.661
I wonder what'd they
say if they saw you now.

23:35.748 --> 23:38.205
Smokin' crack.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.704
Going out with no panties on?

23:40.794 --> 23:42.409
No pain?

23:45.466 --> 23:49.459
I bet they think about you
when you were a little girl.

23:49.553 --> 23:51.794
What the hell happened to ya?

23:54.308 --> 23:57.971
Don't fucking move!
You stay and watch!

23:58.062 --> 24:02.476
You watch her! Watch
your fucking girlfriend.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.903
Fuck!

24:58.497 --> 25:00.237
I need the coke back.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.947
What happened?

25:02.042 --> 25:05.034
I snorted what I thought was coke.
It turned out to be heroin.

25:05.129 --> 25:06.539
I gotta be at work in a hour.

25:06.630 --> 25:08.791
Oh, baby, okay. I'm not alone.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.840
Just get the coke.
I'll get out of here.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.264
You didn't break it
out for your client?

25:26.358 --> 25:28.269
Nah. He brings his own.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.645
Uh-huh.

25:33.073 --> 25:34.904
Who are you?

25:40.414 --> 25:44.282
I'm the last person in the
world you want me to be.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.412
He's just an old friend.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.917
Come on, missy, we've had you
under surveillance for weeks.

25:51.008 --> 25:53.624
Do you have any illegal
substances on you?

25:53.719 --> 25:55.300
Like what?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.127
Asshole.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.680
Cooperate with me, I'll
let you walk outta here.

26:00.768 --> 26:04.556
You play games, come with her.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.314
I got some coke.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.483
Get it.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.576
Get out.

26:35.969 --> 26:37.834
That was fun.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.046
Hey.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.959
Come. Come!

27:20.305 --> 27:21.795
Are you a policeman?

27:21.890 --> 27:22.925
Yes.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.347
Do you know who do this?

27:24.434 --> 27:25.514
I don't know, yet.

27:25.602 --> 27:26.887
Look here.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.140
This dead. Babacar.

27:29.231 --> 27:31.722
This little girl, no more.

27:31.817 --> 27:34.274
He's dead, dead. Older man.

27:34.361 --> 27:37.728
Oh, my angel, she's dead.
All my whole family.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.438
How are you related?

27:39.533 --> 27:42.400
Yasin. She were my sister.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.155
When was the last
time you saw her?

27:44.246 --> 27:47.784
I see her dat morning. I go
by in case she need anything.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.374
But dat morning she says she needs
something from the grocery,

27:51.461 --> 27:55.921
and she called there and had it
delivered by a boy to her home.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.748
Help me, please.

27:57.843 --> 28:01.176
Please, help me find
the killer of my family.

28:01.263 --> 28:05.051
Please, sir. Help me. Help.

28:25.829 --> 28:27.069
Are you the manager?

28:27.164 --> 28:28.164
No, sir.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.289
The manager's over there.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.628
New Orleans homicide. You got
people making deliveries here?

28:36.757 --> 28:40.295
We get different guys making deliveries.
Different days, different guys.

28:40.385 --> 28:42.171
What about Tuesday?

28:42.262 --> 28:44.253
Different times a day.
Different guys.

28:44.348 --> 28:45.633
Llate afternoon.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.887
We don't keep track of
who takes what to who.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.514
A delivery boy hasn't
shown up in a while?

29:18.131 --> 29:20.372
Excuse us. Hello!

29:20.467 --> 29:22.503

We need to talk to you for a second.
Do you mind stepping in the hall?

29:30.269 --> 29:33.181
No, I can't step into the hall.

29:33.272 --> 29:36.105
Can't you see this
lady needs me here?

29:38.110 --> 29:40.977
We're looking for your
grandson, miss Rogers.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.732
What are you
looking for him for?

29:42.823 --> 29:44.939
Just to talk. We just
wanna talk to him.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.194
He do somethin' wrong?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.402
He might've been
a withess to a crime.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.236
I don't know
anything about that.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.117
Where can we find him?

29:53.208 --> 29:58.043
Young man, what do you think gives
you the right to come into my room

29:58.171 --> 30:03.382
and have a conversation without
even acknowledging my presence?

30:03.468 --> 30:05.709
We're terribly sorry.

30:05.804 --> 30:09.513
It's very important we talk
to this woman's grandson.

30:09.599 --> 30:11.885
And she told you she
doesn't know where he is.

30:11.977 --> 30:14.639
Actually, she hasn't
told us that.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.937
I don't know.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.733
I'm sorry, grandma.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.737
What do you wanna know?

30:29.828 --> 30:34.322
Did you make a delivery Tuesday
on Josephine and danneel, son?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.117
Uh-huh.

30:38.211 --> 30:39.576
What did you see there?

30:39.671 --> 30:41.957
This is a 15-year old boy, sir.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.210
We need you to tell us
what you saw, Daryl.

30:44.301 --> 30:47.793
He don't get involved
in drugs, in gangs.

30:47.888 --> 30:50.095
He go to school.

30:50.182 --> 30:52.594
He hold down a job
and he come home.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.640
A family was murdered, ma'am.

30:54.728 --> 30:56.969
And I feel very bad about that.

30:57.064 --> 31:00.431
But I don't want my
grandson involved in it.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.938
Maybe your grandson has
some feelings of his own.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.905
Well,

31:13.538 --> 31:17.952
the lady told me to set the
grocery bags in the kitchen.

31:18.043 --> 31:22.036
Uh, as I was setting the grocery
bags down, I heard screaming.

31:22.130 --> 31:24.121
And I heard gunshots.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.878
So I hid in the closet.

31:30.972 --> 31:33.714
When I came out,
everybody was dead.

31:35.519 --> 31:38.010
Did you see who shot them?

31:47.739 --> 31:50.105
Say yes or no.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.700
This is who we're looking for.
Name is Donald godshaw.

32:01.795 --> 32:05.504

32:17.602 --> 32:20.139
Lieutenant, wanna show

32:21.481 --> 32:24.723
All three were
possible witnesses.

Gary Jenkins, street name "g."

32:41.376 --> 32:43.992

32:44.087 --> 32:47.875
If his laying low chances are,
that's where we'll find him.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.581
Let's bring him in.

33:10.780 --> 33:12.486
Give me a minute.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.666
I need access to the apartment next door.
Do you mind?

33:24.753 --> 33:27.790
Oh! It's okay, baby.

33:27.881 --> 33:29.462
Why you need access for?

33:29.549 --> 33:33.588
We had complaints about disturbance,
not answering the door.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.173
Don't fucking breathe.

35:21.578 --> 35:23.534
I love it.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.613
I just love it.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.667
I've told you everything I know.

35:36.426 --> 35:38.291
This is your lucky day, son.

35:38.428 --> 35:42.387
You're the first person we've picked up.
You're in a position to help yourself.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.055
Help myself do what?

35:44.142 --> 35:46.508
You know something about this
family that got murdered.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.594
I don't know nothing.

35:48.730 --> 35:52.643
You were in the apartment when the africans
got shot. Who was with you? Midget Donald?

35:52.734 --> 35:56.101
Donald godshaw, "big fate." Where is he?
Where can we find him?

35:56.196 --> 35:57.732

35:57.822 --> 36:00.404
We don't need you no more.
There's gonna be five homicides

36:00.492 --> 36:02.028
and Donald's gonna
hand them on you.

36:02.118 --> 36:04.951
He gets eight to ten.
You get for life.

36:05.038 --> 36:07.245
I don't know nobody
named "midget".

36:07.332 --> 36:10.074
I don't know nobody
named "big fate."

36:20.679 --> 36:22.635
Renaldo Hayes!

36:22.722 --> 36:25.839
Oh. Man! That's bad luck.

36:25.975 --> 36:29.968
I keep hope that once in a while this
kid throws to somebody on his own team.

36:30.063 --> 36:33.430
I love the guy. By the end of the
fucking game, I'm starting to hate him.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.935
What do you want
for the weekend?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.891
What's the spread on
Louisiana-Arkansas?

36:36.986 --> 36:38.192
Four.

36:38.279 --> 36:40.065
Louisiana.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.568
Minus to four for a dime.

36:42.659 --> 36:45.401
You got it. I got
a favor to ask.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.281
My kid got a speeding ticket.

36:47.372 --> 36:49.954
I'll take care if you
give me half a point.

36:50.041 --> 36:52.532
You're gonna grind me
for helping out my kid?

36:52.627 --> 36:54.709
Grind you? You're funny
guy, you know that?

36:54.796 --> 36:58.505
There's guys getting half a point on
the street for nothing. Grind you.

37:01.469 --> 37:04.632
All right. But you
take care of it.

37:33.001 --> 37:34.866
Hello. Hello!

37:34.961 --> 37:37.748
I'm lieutenant McDonagh,
New Orleans homicide.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.329
What can I do for you?

37:39.424 --> 37:41.836
A friend of mine's daughter
got written up for speeding.

37:41.926 --> 37:45.009
She was doing 75 on the way to the
hospital to visit her grandmother.

37:45.096 --> 37:48.008
Has a couple of minor, minor
violations in the past.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.839
She's in danger
of losing her license.

37:49.934 --> 37:51.299
What do you want me to do?

37:51.394 --> 37:52.975
/'d like you fo take
care of it for me.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.519
You come to the scene of an
accident to ask me that?

37:55.607 --> 37:57.313
There shouldn't be a problem.

37:57.442 --> 38:01.526
Are you asking me to break the law?
Is that what you're doing here?

38:01.613 --> 38:05.777
I'm asking you one cop to
another to do me a favor.

38:07.202 --> 38:09.033
The answer's no.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.781
Just like that?

38:10.872 --> 38:12.362
Just like that.

38:12.457 --> 38:15.915
Is this the same police
department my father was in?

38:16.002 --> 38:17.333
You'll excuse me.

38:17.420 --> 38:18.785
Great.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.122
Guardian of the flame,
right? Fucking ass.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.458
Get back in you car, lieutenant.

38:25.845 --> 38:27.051
Or else what?

38:27.138 --> 38:29.504
Hey there.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.180
Hey, what are you doing here?

38:31.267 --> 38:32.723
You know the lieutenant?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.676
Yeah. We used to work together.

38:34.771 --> 38:37.478
Why don't you walk him
back to his car?

38:41.820 --> 38:44.402
I could've told you not to
bother with that asshole.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.855
You needed a ticket fixed,
why didn't you come to me?

38:46.950 --> 38:48.531
I didn't know you worked here.

38:48.618 --> 38:51.405
They only let me out on patrol
when they're short handed.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.908
Mostly they got me
in the property room.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.114
Property room?

38:56.209 --> 38:58.200
What are you doing tonight?

39:00.421 --> 39:01.786
You asking me out?

39:01.881 --> 39:03.746
Yes, I am.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.482
Hey.

40:07.572 --> 40:10.985
You like these boots, don't you?

40:11.075 --> 40:13.908
Only on you, you know that.

40:13.995 --> 40:15.951
Yeah?

40:16.039 --> 40:17.529
You're horny?

40:17.624 --> 40:20.991
Oh, yeah.

40:21.085 --> 40:25.624
No, you're not.
You're high on dope.

40:25.715 --> 40:28.923
Not true.

40:29.010 --> 40:32.173
Whatever I take is prescription.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.721
Except for the heroin.

40:37.143 --> 40:39.725
Hey! Wake up, McDonagh.

40:41.564 --> 40:46.558
Yeah, there's times I can't get
what I need with the prescription.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.518
Really?

40:48.613 --> 40:52.902
Yeah. When my back
hurts sometimes.

40:53.034 --> 40:58.245
Well, maybe there's something I
can do to make that pain go away.

40:58.331 --> 41:00.788
You definitely can.

41:00.875 --> 41:03.537
What's that, baby? What do
you want me to do for you?

41:03.628 --> 41:06.244
Check out your property room

41:06.339 --> 41:09.627
and see if there's any oxycontin

41:09.717 --> 41:11.958
or morphine

41:12.053 --> 41:16.262
you can sneak outta there.

41:16.349 --> 41:20.467
Just make sure you get
rid of the voucher copy.

41:23.147 --> 41:25.433
You're nuts.

41:42.375 --> 41:45.208
Hey.

41:45.294 --> 41:48.457
The ticket's gonna be a little
more complicated than I thought.

41:48.548 --> 41:50.914
You're kidding me.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.796
The best thing to do is to
have her plead not guilty.

41:53.886 --> 41:57.845
By the time a court day comes around,
I'll talk to the cop who wrote her up.

41:57.932 --> 42:00.048
I thought that's what
you were gonna do.

42:00.143 --> 42:03.180
I went straight
to the lieutenant.

42:03.271 --> 42:06.263
He wound up being a hard on.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.349
It'll work out. It's just gonna
take a little longer. Come on.

42:09.485 --> 42:15.071
Kinda calls into question the
half-a-point-for-nothing concept, don't you think?

42:15.158 --> 42:17.114
You're some cheap
prick, you know that?

42:17.201 --> 42:19.988
You say you're gonna do
something and you don't do it.

42:20.079 --> 42:22.365
Good! Charge me
for the half point.

42:22.457 --> 42:27.702
And after last weekend,
you're down $3,000.

42:27.795 --> 42:31.458
You might, I mean, might

42:31.549 --> 42:34.962
have thought to bring me
a little something.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.510
Two dimes!

42:38.598 --> 42:40.759
On Louisiana

42:40.850 --> 42:43.057
against Georgia.

42:46.022 --> 42:48.684
Okay, you got it.

43:31.567 --> 43:32.773
How long has he been in there?

43:32.860 --> 43:34.020
About 20 minutes.

43:34.112 --> 43:35.648
Who else?

43:35.738 --> 43:38.525
His girlfriend. At least one.
That's as far as we know.

43:38.616 --> 43:41.949
What are these fucking iguanas
doing on my coffee table?

43:42.036 --> 43:44.118
There ain't no iguana.

43:44.205 --> 43:45.536
Yeah, there are.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.285
There ain't no iguana.

43:48.376 --> 43:50.708
What the fuck is that?
Fucking iguana.

43:52.922 --> 43:54.082
Are we set up?

43:54.173 --> 43:55.538
SWAT's around the corner.

43:55.633 --> 43:58.750
No! No, just, just no SWAT.
Let them stay there.

43:58.845 --> 44:01.928
The duty captain said he wanted
to coordinate with us when we...

44:02.056 --> 44:05.765
Is that what you're fucking doing now?
Reporting back to the duty captain?

44:05.852 --> 44:07.717
I'm telling you what he said.

44:08.938 --> 44:11.771
If we need SWAT, we'll call 'em.

45:20.218 --> 45:21.378
Let's go.

45:43.366 --> 45:44.446
Who else is in here?

45:44.533 --> 45:45.943
Nobody.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.617
We're gonna come back
every day, you understand?

45:48.746 --> 45:54.116
More times we come back, more
chances that child getting shot.

45:54.210 --> 45:55.996
Ain't nobody here.

45:56.087 --> 45:58.624
He's hiding
back there in the armoire.

46:06.222 --> 46:08.929
You all stay with her. Armand.

46:25.032 --> 46:26.363
Get up.

46:26.450 --> 46:28.281
I said get up!

46:28.369 --> 46:30.109
Damn, man.

46:30.204 --> 46:34.072
It's always nice to see
an intact family.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.657
A father who honors
his obligations

46:36.752 --> 46:39.539
as far as his
children are a concern.

46:39.630 --> 46:42.246
You're here.
That's important thing.

46:42.341 --> 46:45.925
You may be hiding in an armoire,
but your child knows you're here.

46:46.012 --> 46:47.343
Are you tripping, man?

46:47.430 --> 46:48.715
Armand, give us a minute.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.637
You're tripping.
You want that shit.

46:50.725 --> 46:53.842
Shut the door. Shut up.
Shut the door.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.015
Sit down.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.805
Sit down, sit down.

47:03.612 --> 47:05.603
Now we can talk.

47:07.825 --> 47:10.316
You don't mind if I
light one up, do you?

47:10.411 --> 47:12.402
Fuck, man.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.952
I find it relaxes me.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.788
What the fuck, man?

47:19.879 --> 47:24.043
You know we got your
boy, "g." Right?

47:24.133 --> 47:26.465
Man, I don't know no "g."

47:27.887 --> 47:29.798
He knows you.

47:32.016 --> 47:33.881
It's amazing how much
you can get done

47:33.976 --> 47:37.343
when you've got a simple
purpose guiding through life.

47:43.027 --> 47:45.439
My purpose is to find out

47:45.529 --> 47:48.191
who shot up this
apartment on Josephine.

47:48.282 --> 47:51.319
I know the guy who was living
there was from Senegal.

47:51.410 --> 47:53.366
I know he was selling heroin.

47:53.454 --> 47:56.696
I know whose territory
he was stepping on.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.954
And I know who went over to the
apartment to straighten him out.

48:00.044 --> 48:03.878
I found out all that
in the past few days.

48:06.050 --> 48:08.666
Where is "big fate," son?

48:08.761 --> 48:11.343
I don't know no "big fate.”

48:13.386 --> 48:13.516
You see, I know that's not true.

48:13.517 --> 48:17.100
'Cause everybody who comes from where
you come, knows who "big fate" is.

48:17.186 --> 48:20.269
The fact that you're lying to me,
tells me you're hiding something.

48:20.398 --> 48:24.232
You know my only reason for being here is
to find out who shot up the apartment.

48:24.318 --> 48:27.276
I know that's what you're hiding.
See? It all,

48:27.363 --> 48:31.823
all comes back to that
same simple purpose.

48:31.909 --> 48:36.323
Man, I ain't telling you shit.

48:57.476 --> 48:59.512
Hey.

48:59.603 --> 49:01.434
What's wrong?

49:01.522 --> 49:04.639
Your father's mad at me 'cause I
can't take care of his fucking dog.

49:04.733 --> 49:06.473
Why does he need you
to take care of it?

49:06.569 --> 49:09.356
'Cause he's going back into aa.

49:09.447 --> 49:13.065
He says he can't do with
any more responsibilities.

49:13.159 --> 49:16.572
Besides that he,
he's gotta stop drinking.

49:16.662 --> 49:20.450
I mean, ain't like I don't
wanna take care of it,

49:20.541 --> 49:24.580
but I leave at 7:00 in the
morning to go to work!

49:24.670 --> 49:27.207
Oh, let me talk to him.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.540
I try to be a good wife to him, Terence.
I do. But you know,

49:30.634 --> 49:32.795
I got a limit, too.

49:32.928 --> 49:37.547
You know, he's got a drinking problem.
He says he's got a drinking problem.

49:37.641 --> 49:40.383
He wants to so something
about it. That's good.

49:40.478 --> 49:44.721
You know, he's been down this
road before and it didn't take.

49:44.815 --> 49:47.852
He wants to try it again. Good!

49:47.985 --> 49:52.604
But I, I say to him, why don't you
just take the beer the way that I do,

49:52.698 --> 49:55.440
but he says he can't do that.

49:55.534 --> 49:57.399
Hey, pop.

49:57.495 --> 49:58.780
How are you doing?

49:58.871 --> 50:00.862
I thought you said
the meeting was at seven.

50:00.956 --> 50:03.242
I gotta get there early.
Set up the chairs.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.334
I'll take you.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.957
She can do it.

50:06.045 --> 50:09.503
I came over to see you. Let me
take you for a ride, at least.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.047
You feed the dog?

50:13.385 --> 50:14.750
You feed the dog?

50:14.845 --> 50:16.710
I can take care of him.

50:16.805 --> 50:19.296
What are you talking about?

50:19.391 --> 50:22.224
Genevieve told me a little
about what's going on.

50:22.311 --> 50:24.427
I'll take the dog off
your hands for a while.

50:24.522 --> 50:26.433
How are you gonna
take care of a dog?

50:26.524 --> 50:30.938
I got a friend. She just loves animals.
All of them. Dogs, too.

50:33.155 --> 50:35.066
Let's go.

50:42.706 --> 50:45.163
Have a good time!

51:03.227 --> 51:05.639
No. No!

51:06.814 --> 51:09.305
Fuck you. Fuck you.

51:13.529 --> 51:15.895
Did we not discuss
this on the phone?

51:18.200 --> 51:21.033
How come you only call me
when you need something?

51:21.120 --> 51:22.656
You're fucked up, aren't you?

51:22.746 --> 51:25.112
What? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fucked up.

51:25.207 --> 51:26.617
What are you doing?

51:26.709 --> 51:28.825
I'm going to work. I have
to go to biloxy tonight.

51:28.919 --> 51:30.659
Go to the hotel casino.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.336
How are you gonna take care of
the dog if you're fucked up

51:33.424 --> 51:35.210
and you're going fo biloxy?

51:35.301 --> 51:38.168
All right. The doorman's gonna
walk him in the morning

51:38.262 --> 51:40.594
and I get back in the afternoon.

51:40.681 --> 51:44.139
Oh, he's sweet. What's his name?

51:45.686 --> 51:47.517
I don't know.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.770
You don't know his name?

51:50.858 --> 51:52.223
I'll ask my father.

51:52.318 --> 51:53.854
You are unbelievable.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.605
I gotta get going.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.358
Unbelievable. You don't know.

51:58.449 --> 52:00.440
Baby, be nice to me.

52:02.453 --> 52:06.867
He smells. You need a bath.

52:06.999 --> 52:10.287
Try to understand. It doesn't matter
that you were just along for the ride.

52:10.377 --> 52:12.789
It doesn't matter that you
didn't actually shoot anybody.

52:12.921 --> 52:15.879
You're playing the prices now. The
price of "big fate" getting off,

52:15.966 --> 52:19.709
it's gonna help the da convict
you and your boy “g.”

52:19.803 --> 52:22.545
I guarantee you that's
just what he's gonna do.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.380
Why don't you smoke, man?

52:24.475 --> 52:25.885
What are you talking about?

52:25.976 --> 52:28.718
I gotta listen
all this bullshit.

52:28.812 --> 52:30.143
Break out to smoke, man.

52:30.230 --> 52:31.766
Flipping out on us?

52:31.857 --> 52:34.724
No, man. Your partner lit
up a motherfucker blunt

52:34.818 --> 52:36.399
before he put the cuffs on me.

52:36.487 --> 52:39.194
I love this guy.

52:39.281 --> 52:41.818
You say I smoked marijuana
in your presence? Huh?

52:41.909 --> 52:43.820
Cannabis? Is that
what you're saying?

52:46.330 --> 52:48.992
So they fuck won't
believe me, right?

52:49.083 --> 52:51.244
Lieutenant.

52:51.335 --> 52:54.668
Lieutenant, can you
step out for a moment?

53:12.481 --> 53:15.223
My name is
Eugene gratz, lieutenant.

53:15.317 --> 53:19.606
I'm an attorney. This is
my client Donald godshaw.

53:19.697 --> 53:23.531
I understand you've
been looking for him.

53:23.617 --> 53:26.950
How can I help you?

53:40.843 --> 53:43.255
I just wanna talk to
these guys for a second.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.427
Why don't you wait there?

53:47.474 --> 53:49.180
Gentlemen.

53:53.188 --> 53:55.179
Can I get you a glass of water?

53:55.274 --> 53:57.139
Um, no, thanks.

53:57.234 --> 54:02.024
I gotta turn over the names of my
witnesses to godshaw's lawyer.

54:02.114 --> 54:05.572
As soon as I do that, godshaw
will look to scare the kid.

54:05.659 --> 54:08.196
He can't scare him,
he'll kill him.

54:08.287 --> 54:09.527
He'll never get to him.

54:09.621 --> 54:11.327
Since godshaw turned himself in,

54:11.415 --> 54:14.407
I've authorized 24-hour
protection to start immediately.

54:14.501 --> 54:17.083
Just remember,
we have no prints,

54:17.171 --> 54:19.583
no DNA, no weapon.

54:19.673 --> 54:22.915
We lose the kid,
we lose the case.

54:23.010 --> 54:25.171
Understood?

54:33.270 --> 54:36.603
He's a nice dogs.
I just can't keep him.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.272
She said she'd be back
at 1:00 this afternoon.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.850
I'm off at 4:00, and I got
another job I gotta be at.

54:41.945 --> 54:43.435
She didn't call?

54:43.530 --> 54:45.258
No. And the night guy ain't
gonna go walk him.

54:45.282 --> 54:48.115
I can't leave the animal in her apartment.
It might do damage.

54:48.202 --> 54:49.612
How did you get my number?

54:49.703 --> 54:52.740
Miss Frankie gave it to me
in case of emergencies.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.913
Emergencies?

54:59.463 --> 55:02.330
This is what I'm talking about.
Doesn't pick up the phone.

55:02.424 --> 55:08.135
She isn't where she's supposed to be.
Not showing up.

55:08.263 --> 55:12.552
Terence, think they're gonna put
me on the witness stand by may 15?

55:12.643 --> 55:14.429
Don't know, why?

55:14.520 --> 55:17.637
So my mom goes
for the parole board.

55:19.525 --> 55:22.813
I'm sure we can get people to
put in a good word for her.

55:24.655 --> 55:26.361
Hello?

55:26.448 --> 55:28.484
Where are you?

55:29.660 --> 55:33.073
I'm about an hour from there.

55:33.163 --> 55:35.028
I'm on my way.

55:35.123 --> 55:38.081
Frankie, I'm on my way.

55:38.168 --> 55:40.409
You ever been to biloxy?

56:35.517 --> 56:37.473
Now, you stand there.

56:37.561 --> 56:39.097
Don't move.

56:39.187 --> 56:41.894
I'll be back in five minutes.

56:43.734 --> 56:44.769
Baby.

56:44.860 --> 56:46.851
Hi, baby. What are you doing?

56:46.945 --> 56:47.980
You all right?

56:48.071 --> 56:50.312
Yeah.

56:51.617 --> 56:52.948
You okay?

56:53.035 --> 56:54.946
Yeah.

56:57.998 --> 56:59.784
Who did it?

56:59.875 --> 57:02.833
Do you have anything for me?

57:02.920 --> 57:04.410
Some coke.

57:04.504 --> 57:05.835
That's it?

57:05.923 --> 57:07.504
And Vicodin.

57:07.591 --> 57:09.456
I'll take both.

57:13.639 --> 57:16.051
What the fuck is
going on in here?

57:21.855 --> 57:23.140
Who's this?

57:23.231 --> 57:24.971
Hey, hey, hey!

57:25.067 --> 57:26.352
Take it easy.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.853
Just get my money.

57:27.945 --> 57:29.651
What are you, jealous boyfriend?

57:29.738 --> 57:31.069
Just get me my money.

57:31.156 --> 57:32.737
I'm using to paying
when I'm done.

57:32.824 --> 57:34.780
Done smacking her around?

57:34.868 --> 57:37.154
It was erotic shit, man.
I didn't hurt her.

57:38.455 --> 57:39.455
Didn't that hurt?

57:39.539 --> 57:40.995
Did I hurt you?

57:41.083 --> 57:42.289
Terence, let's just go.

57:42.376 --> 57:44.708
We don't hit women down south.

57:44.795 --> 57:47.207
You just made a big mistake.

57:47.297 --> 57:50.380
My father is Andy winnick,
you ever hear of him?

57:50.467 --> 57:52.879
One of the biggest developers
in the Gulf coast.

57:52.970 --> 57:54.210
Congratulations.

57:54.304 --> 57:56.169
Tommy leonardi is one
of his best friends.

57:56.306 --> 58:00.390
Listen, scumbag. Don't try to impress me
with you-father knows-some-Guinea hood.

58:00.519 --> 58:04.558
What you gotta take away from this experience
is that if you ever see that girl again,

58:04.690 --> 58:08.057
you turn around and you walk in the
opposite direction. You got that?

58:08.151 --> 58:09.151
Yeah, man.

58:09.236 --> 58:11.101
So much looking at that girl,

58:11.196 --> 58:14.063
you're gonna wish you
were born without a dick.

58:14.157 --> 58:19.322
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, whoa.

58:19.413 --> 58:22.905
Whoa. Big mistake.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.241
Oh, yeah.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.826
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:27.921 --> 58:31.459
Big mistake.

58:37.431 --> 58:41.515
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

58:43.353 --> 58:45.435
Whoa.

58:47.858 --> 58:49.974
Oh, yeah.

58:53.321 --> 58:57.109
Daryl, this is Frankie.
Frankie, Daryl.

58:57.200 --> 58:59.612
Hi, Daryl.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.364
Hi

59:17.554 --> 59:19.920
I gotta go talk to someone.

59:20.015 --> 59:23.724
You go ahead and take
Frankie to the coffee shop.

59:23.810 --> 59:26.472
And you stay with her.
You can do that, right?

59:26.563 --> 59:27.723
Yeah.

59:27.814 --> 59:29.270
Do you have to do that now?

59:29.357 --> 59:31.222
I'll be with you in a minute.

59:32.736 --> 59:35.068
Let's go? Take care of me.

59:40.744 --> 59:42.484
How'd Louisiana go off that?

59:42.579 --> 59:44.319
Three-point underdogs.

59:44.414 --> 59:46.746
Three-point underdogs.
What are they losing by?

59:46.833 --> 59:48.323
Eight.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.033
Eight? What the fuck is that?

59:50.128 --> 59:52.119
There's still two
minutes left to play.

59:54.091 --> 59:56.582
Louisiana ain't got
this passing game.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.007
Good point.

59:58.095 --> 01:00:01.212
You wanna get my picks
for the pac-10?

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.388
Do I look like I wanna hear 'em?

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.522
Where is the kid?

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:23.108
He went to the bathroom.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:05.075
Hi. Are there any other
bathrooms beside that one?

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.323
Yeah, on the other side.

01:01:16.214 --> 01:01:20.924
Hey, man, insert more coins.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.002
Insert more coins.

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:26.011
Insert more coins.

01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:33.012
Insert more coins. Play again.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.891
Insert more coins.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:42.316
Insert more coins.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.483
What's going on?

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:48.239
What did he say when he left?

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.662
He asked me if I'd be okay
waiting here by myself.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:53.532
I said yeah. He said he had to go
to the bathroom. What is going on?

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:55.208
He's a witness to a homicide.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.295
To what?

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:57.835
To five homicides. Let's go.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:58.958
Where are we going?

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.539
To find him.

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.509
Where is he?

01:03:28.596 --> 01:03:30.632
Binnie, call security.

01:03:30.724 --> 01:03:32.840
Nobody's calling anybody.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.470
Where's your grandson, binnie?

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.143
I don't have
to tell you anything.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.395
Yeah, you do.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:47.070
I haven't done anything. My
grandson hasn't done anything.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:50.695
If he doesn't wanna be a witness,
he doesn't have to be a witness.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:53.401
This is bigger than one, two.

01:03:53.496 --> 01:03:55.407
This was a massacre.

01:03:55.498 --> 01:03:56.738
Children

01:03:58.335 --> 01:04:00.246
were executed.

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:03.329
Maybe you should've
thought of that before.

01:04:07.052 --> 01:04:09.794
I need to know where he is.

01:04:09.888 --> 01:04:14.848
Young man, I would like to know
the name of your superior.

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:21.270
Right now I'm working on about
an hour and a half sleep

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.349
over the past three days.

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:28.062
And I'm still trying
to remain courteous.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:33.113
And I'm beginning to think that that's
getting in the way of my being effective.

01:04:41.461 --> 01:04:43.452
What are you doing?

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.254
What... what are you doing?

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:52.961
I wanna know

01:04:53.056 --> 01:04:55.297
where Daryl is.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.723
My god.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:59.472
Nobody saw me come in.
Nobody knows I'm here.

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:01.644
This old woman's
gonna run out of air,

01:05:01.731 --> 01:05:05.315
and you're gonna have a tough time
convincing people that it wasn't you

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:10.146
who did it to her. And even if,
and even if you do convince them

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.357
that you didn't
kill her on purpose,

01:05:13.451 --> 01:05:16.318
you're still gonna have a tough
time selling them that you

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:19.496
took care of her with a fuck!

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:21.163
Now, listen to me.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.993
Where the fuck is he?

01:05:25.755 --> 01:05:27.336
I said where the fuck is he?

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.006
He's on an airplane.

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:32.584
Miss antoinette
bought him a ticket

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:36.342
and send him to live
with her family in england.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:44.346
All right, it's okay. That's okay.
That's a good girl. Suck it up.

01:05:44.441 --> 01:05:47.683
There you go. That's it. Take it in.
That's a good girl. Take it in.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:50.689
Good! Good.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.361
Good.

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.531
That's it. Breathe.

01:05:54.617 --> 01:05:57.199
Maybe you should drop
dead, you selfish cunt.

01:05:57.287 --> 01:06:01.530
You ever think about your
kids or your grandkids? Huh?

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.750
Sucking up their inheritance
through that fucked oxygen tube?

01:06:05.837 --> 01:06:08.374
And binnie's fucked
intensive care?

01:06:09.674 --> 01:06:12.086
You fucks, I hate you.
I hate you both.

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.381
I should, I should
fucking both, right now,

01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:18.964
I should fucking
kill you fucking both.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:24.811
You're the fucking reason this
country's going down the drain.

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:44.577
Watch out. He's not
in a good mood.

01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.496
Come in.

01:06:50.465 --> 01:06:52.501
Have a seat.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:55.379
Scotland yard called.
The kid's in england.

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:59.346
Make him a material witness. Maybe
Scotland yard will hold him.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:02.595
Can't do that. He had no
involvement with the crime.

01:07:02.685 --> 01:07:04.926
He don't want testify,
we can't compel him.

01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:07.262
Well, we could still try
flipping one of the three.

01:07:07.357 --> 01:07:09.143
You can fry all what you want.

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:12.271
Nobody flipping on godshaw.
They're scared to death of him.

01:07:12.362 --> 01:07:15.445
As of now, all are
persons of interest.

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.068
You gotta let him go.

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:20.025
Oh, come on! Five homicides
and you're letting him go?

01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:22.781
You weren't supposed to let
the kid out of your sight.

01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:24.453
Be glad he didn't turn out dead.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:25.451
This is bullshit.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:26.748
Get the hell outta here.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.415
You're not the one
on the street...

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:30.209
Get out of my office.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:33.129
Risking our lives on the street!

01:07:33.216 --> 01:07:36.333
You know what's involved, right?

01:07:36.469 --> 01:07:41.930
Maybe if we get a prosecutor worry about
something, we could stand a fucking chance.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.060
What happened when you went
fo see the grandmother?

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:57.190
I told you.

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:01.157
She said the woman she takes care of, bought
a plane ticket. He was on his way to england

01:08:01.244 --> 01:08:02.700
to stay with her relatives.

01:08:02.787 --> 01:08:04.493
Any incidents took
place over there?

01:08:04.581 --> 01:08:06.037
What kind of incidents?

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:07.330
Any kind.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.782
No.

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:14.459
Whatever it is, you're gonna
have your story down.

01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:17.211
Public integrity is waiting
for you back at the house.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.384
Oh, come on. Public
integrity into this?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:20.960
What for?

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:25.594
That old woman, her son is a
United States congressman.

01:08:29.814 --> 01:08:31.554
I asked where Daryl was.

01:08:31.649 --> 01:08:34.812
His grandmother told me.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:39.692
You didn't, at any time,
threaten his grandmother?

01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:43.569
No, I did not.

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:46.948
You didn't, at any time,
threaten antoinette fahringer?

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.779
No, I did not.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:52.709
You should know a formal complaint's
been filed alleging you cut off

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.377
Mrs. fahringer's oxygen supply.

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:58.548
Who's saying that?
Mrs. fahringer?

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:00.171
Is it true?

01:09:00.261 --> 01:09:02.923
I think she might be suffering
from a little dementia.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:05.300
Lieutenant, we're
asking if it's true.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:08.303
Absolutely not.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.645
Lieutenant.

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:23.398
You know, I saw five of those
driving into work this morning.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:26.609
I want you to clean it up.
Clean it up.

01:09:28.665 --> 01:09:31.747
Ned, excellent. You got my message.
Good. Come on.

01:09:31.834 --> 01:09:33.040
What message?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.912
You get the flowers
I sent? How's Jenny?

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:36.868
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:38.420
Okay, that's good.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.542
Stop it! Cut it out.

01:09:39.634 --> 01:09:40.840
What are you doing here?

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:42.417
What do you think?

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.048
I don't have anything for you.

01:09:44.138 --> 01:09:45.423
Then this is a problem.

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.130
Yeah, who needs a problem?

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:50.638
You owe me five large, Terence.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.264
I haven't got it.

01:09:52.354 --> 01:09:54.516
Then, you gotta
give me something.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:58.646
Give me goods if you don't have cash.
Give me a gold rolex.

01:09:58.736 --> 01:10:00.943
Ned, I look like
I got a gold rolex?

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:03.612
Don't pine me for
a fucking stooge.

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:05.941
Keep your voice down.
Just keep it down.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:09.619
Don't play me
for a fucking stooge.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.321
Are you done?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:14.874
Do you think these guys care you're a cop?
They will fuck you up

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.792
just like everybody else.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.915
Let me get something
down with the Texas game.

01:10:19.006 --> 01:10:21.167
'Cause that's where
the season turns a lot.

01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:23.341
No.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:28.388
Nothing. You pay
what the fuck you owe.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:35.975
I'm a little late on
my rent, that's all.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.477
Lieutenant.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:43.062
Uh, somebody named
Frankie called.

01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:11.426
What's going on?

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:14.975
All kinds of things.
Come closer. I'm Dave.

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.177
Who are you?

01:11:16.272 --> 01:11:17.307
Andy.

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:18.604
Jeff.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:20.431
What do you want?

01:11:20.526 --> 01:11:24.519
What I want right now is to get
this behind position right.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:25.899
He wants money.

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.651
Who are you?

01:11:27.742 --> 01:11:31.360
Sit down. I told you, I'm Dave.

01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:35.413
And the guy you robbed,
I know told you he was.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.458
You make a date with a pretty girl.
You gotta pay.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:43.163
Dear. Like this.

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:49.002
You want the schwantz, not the prosty.
See? That's it.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:53.051
When you engage with another human being,
we remind ourselves we're not alone.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.975
Plus, who knows, maybe we even
learn a little something.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.677
How much?

01:11:57.772 --> 01:12:00.809
You took 10 off. To make it
right, you gotta come up with 50.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.390
No, that's bullshit.

01:12:02.485 --> 01:12:04.817
No, it's punitive damages.
What can I tell you?

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.065
I don't get it. She kept
up with the bargain.

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.692
He says no.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:11.399
He's a fucking liar. I did
everything he asked me to do.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:13.200
Which was what?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.653
You want details?

01:12:15.748 --> 01:12:17.909
You sick people.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.209
Oh, listen to her stand up for herself.
The indignation.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:23.706
I love it.

01:12:23.798 --> 01:12:25.129
Where's the money?

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:27.332
In my bag.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.466
It's all here?

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:35.845
Okay. Here are five thousand.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:37.516
There's ten in change here.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.844
Why don't I give you
this, call a day.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:45.021
We could do that. Alternatively, I
could tell Jeffy to shoot the dog.

01:12:45.111 --> 01:12:48.148
Do you want me
to shoot the fucking dog?

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:53.279
Or put my calling card on
this gorgeous punum here.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.200
I don't give a shit
about the dog.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:58.662
But you Mark her up, I'm gonna have a
tough time getting you your money.

01:12:58.749 --> 01:13:00.410
By my money you mean $50,000.

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:01.786
I'll need a couple of days.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:03.618
By a couple you mean two.

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.919
Yeah.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:06.542
Good.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.088
Hey.

01:13:08.175 --> 01:13:10.757
[ Know. Relax.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:14.550
The boys wanna saddle her up just
in the spirit of friendliness.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:16.130
You mind?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.308
Well, let her get cleaned
up, put on something hot.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:21.306
She looks like shit right now.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:22.557
Beautiful.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.513
What are you waiting for?

01:13:27.528 --> 01:13:29.359
I don't wanna put
any pressure on you,

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:32.280
but she has a client
coming over in 15 minutes.

01:13:32.366 --> 01:13:34.027
You boys can be
done by the, right?

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:35.904
The both of us?

01:13:35.995 --> 01:13:39.032
They'd had been done in 15
seconds you hadn't mentioned it.

01:13:39.123 --> 01:13:40.408
My mistake.

01:13:40.499 --> 01:13:42.490
You'll hit her
when we come back.

01:13:42.585 --> 01:13:45.167
Two days, same time,
same station, yes?

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.165
Okay. You got it, baby.

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.918
Don't make me look
for you, Terence.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.041
They're gone.

01:14:28.047 --> 01:14:31.084
I'm gonna take you
to my father's house.

01:14:31.175 --> 01:14:33.712
Buy some time at least.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.382
Frankie.

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:40.222
They're gone.

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:49.561
I can't take her.

01:14:49.652 --> 01:14:53.110
I just need a place where she
can stay for a couple of days.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:55.529
Why can't you put her
up in your place?

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:59.074
I can't take a chance these guys
find out where I live, dad.

01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:02.073
Christ!

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:04.871
They gave me the job of
bringing cookies to a meeting.

01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:07.075
It takes me half
a day to get it done.

01:15:07.169 --> 01:15:09.330
You want me to baby-sit a pros?

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:11.162
You don't have to baby-sit her.

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:13.293
She's very self-suficient.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:18.253
Well, I'm not in any kind of shape
to take on something like this.

01:15:18.347 --> 01:15:20.713
Look, I get home
from one meeting.

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:24.972
I lie on the couch and I wait till
it's time for the next meeting.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.178
That's all I can do right now.

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.434
Let your wife deal with her.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.857
They'll get along like sisters.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:34.435
Get away from me, you rag.

01:15:36.907 --> 01:15:40.695
My husband is trying to quit drinking
and you bring this shit into our house?

01:15:40.786 --> 01:15:44.028
Give it back or I'll swear to god
I will stab you in the heart.

01:15:44.123 --> 01:15:46.409
I will stab you in the heart.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.661
What kind of trash
you're bringing in here?

01:15:48.753 --> 01:15:51.495
She's going through my bag!
My personal shit!

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:52.999
Everybody calm down.

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.796
It's hard enough
for your father.

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.546
He's gotta put up with
narcotics under his nose.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:02.096
Oh, god. It can't be any worse than you
being shit face on beer all the time.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.174
Enough!

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:06.725
You tell her I'm
shit face all the time?

01:16:06.812 --> 01:16:09.224
Oh, it's prelly
fucking obvious, lady!

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.307
Oh, yeah? You fucking whore.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.019
Watch this. Come get it.
Come fucking get it.

01:16:16.113 --> 01:16:19.651
Get her outta here. I can't
deal with this shit.

01:16:19.742 --> 01:16:21.573
You cunt.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:23.241
Hey, the neighbors!

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.240
You're a cunt, you whore.

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.743
I'll fuck you up.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:30.996
We come in or you come out?

01:16:31.087 --> 01:16:33.999
Alright, come on, let's go.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:37.674
So, uh, Francesca donnenfeld.
Do you know her?

01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:41.002
Just cut the bullshit, yasco, and
tell me what you're here for.

01:16:41.097 --> 01:16:42.837
I'm yasco.

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.174
Here's the thing, tough guy. You
keep fucking with the wrong people.

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:49.180
First the old lady, now your
prostitute friend's customer.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:53.272
The old lady, you might've written out.
She, uh, doesn't remember so good.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.897
The colored nurse, she's covering
for the grandson, whatever.

01:16:56.987 --> 01:16:59.774
But why I get a call
from the chief d's office

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.857
that you've shaken down
your pros friend's customer

01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:07.867
whose father's hung all the way
from here to fucking city hall.

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:10.164
You're done, lieutenant.

01:17:10.251 --> 01:17:11.741
What do you want?

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:13.952
Your gun, for starters.

01:17:15.464 --> 01:17:16.704
Come on.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.884
Until the outcome
of the hearing,

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.057
you're on modify duty.

01:17:28.144 --> 01:17:31.636
Better call your delegate. You
got an ass kicking coming.

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:35.765
You have a good day, lieutenant.

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:51.577
A man without a
gun is not a man.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:54.659
Oh, well, I know. Look, you
cut the best deal you can

01:17:54.753 --> 01:17:58.291
and you get the hell out of the police
department. 'Cause if you stay in,

01:17:58.382 --> 01:18:00.293
it's gonna get worse.

01:18:00.384 --> 01:18:02.670
Can I talk to you for a second?

01:18:02.761 --> 01:18:06.879
I can't stay here. I didn't take
this shit from my own mother

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:08.714
and I'm not gonna
take it from her.

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:12.722
Can I get a minute alone
with my girlfriend?

01:18:12.855 --> 01:18:16.814
Just give her a day or two. She's
gonna calm down, I promise.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:20.359
I'm so, I'm so happy
you're here.

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:24.314
And I got something else somewhere.
I'll show you.

01:18:24.408 --> 01:18:27.150
She's really mean.

01:18:45.387 --> 01:18:47.594
I wanna show you this place.

01:18:48.682 --> 01:18:51.890
I spent a lot of time here

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.218
when I was a boy.

01:18:54.313 --> 01:18:56.144
That doesn't work anymore.

01:18:56.232 --> 01:18:59.065
I was here alone a lot.

01:19:00.486 --> 01:19:04.195
This was my special place

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.862
as a child.

01:19:07.117 --> 01:19:10.200
My, my castle.

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:14.826
And I would imagine things here.
Pirates, a buried treasure.

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:19.877
And my dad didn't like that so
much, but my mom, she, she got it.

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:22.831
And, uh, and before she died,

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:26.884
she bought me a metal detector.
Come on, let me show you something.

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:29.337
Look at that. Right out there,

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:34.346
I thought that pirates
came up the Mississippi

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:39.222
and that they buried a treasure right
there by that tree next to the house.

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:42.854
So I, I took the metal
detector my mom gave me

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:45.527
and I went out there waiting
it would start beeping.

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:48.196
It was like beep-beep,
beep, beep, beep.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.902
And I started digging, and
I-i-1 dug and I dug and I dug,

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:57.707
and I found a, a Sterling silver
spoon, and I was so happy.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:20:01.160
I started screaming
and jumping and laughing.

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:03.871
And I went, "hey, man,
this is treasure.

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.800
This is pirate treasure.” and
I came back in here with it.

01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:12.718
And I hid it somewhere,
this Sterling silver spoon.

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:14.844
I still can't find it.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:17.809
It could be anywhere.

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:22.064
I-I know it's here.

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:35.869
I don't know what
fo tell you, Terence.

01:20:35.956 --> 01:20:38.038
Not a lot I can do
under the circumstances.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:40.286
I know.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:46.585
I tell you guys all the time, you cannot
get away with that cowboy shit anymore.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:50.588
You don't listen, now
this is where were at.

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:54.555
My best fucking detective, I gotta
put him in the property room.

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:24.285
Terence, come on.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.042
Man, I-I don't wanna you get
jammed off for all of this.

01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:31.417
You're doing all this wrong shit and I'm
here. They're gonna think I'm doing it, too.

01:21:31.512 --> 01:21:35.096
So, go to the store warehouse in
metairie that way you're not here.

01:21:35.224 --> 01:21:39.263
And while you're there, get me my .45
Magnum and bring it to me. Okay?

01:21:45.567 --> 01:21:47.899
Hey.

01:21:47.986 --> 01:21:49.647
You're working here?

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.104
Looks like. What you got there?

01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:55.942
Nine, ten grams of
heroin and a glock nine.

01:21:56.036 --> 01:21:59.369
Yeah. You see that
scale over there?

01:21:59.456 --> 01:22:00.992
It's broken.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.078
See? Useless.

01:22:04.169 --> 01:22:05.955
I sent for a new one.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:09.038
As soon as it gets here,
I'll weigh the drugs

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:10.998
and I'll get you
your voucher, okay?

01:22:11.093 --> 01:22:12.458
All right, bye-bye.

01:22:21.437 --> 01:22:23.849
Can I help you, sir?
Can [I help you, sir?

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.276
Can I talk to you a minute?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.694
Excuse me?

01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:35.397
Mind stepping outside?
I'd like to talk to you.

01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:40.031
You interrupted my meal.

01:22:40.164 --> 01:22:44.032
I'm gonna pretend to be polite, so you
look a big man in front of your friends.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:46.663
You give me a hard time,
I'll put the cuffs on you

01:22:46.753 --> 01:22:48.994
just like any other shitbird.

01:22:51.842 --> 01:22:53.127
I'll be back.

01:22:53.218 --> 01:22:54.253
You a'ight?

01:22:54.344 --> 01:22:55.880
Motherfucker wanna talk to me.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.713
You ain't gonna shoot me,
are you, motherfucker?

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.798
Why would I do that?

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:10.395
I got something for you
I think you're gonna like.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:11.851
Let's take a walk.

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:23.578
Be crazy for coming down here.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.076
I'm gonna give you a chance to make
some money the old fashion way

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.287
with a cop protecting you.

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:32.871
What I need protection from?

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:34.422
The cops.

01:23:34.510 --> 01:23:38.594
A cop will protect me from cops?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.262
You'll know when a supplier
is under surveillance.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.342
You'll know when it's safe to
make a pick up, when it's not.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.721
What I gotta give you?

01:23:45.812 --> 01:23:47.598
Fifteen thousand a shipment.

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.850
Oh, I'm sorry,
am I being unfair?

01:23:51.193 --> 01:23:53.309
How I know you ain't
looking to set me up?

01:23:53.403 --> 01:23:56.611
Tomorrow I'll bring you some information.
Small shit.

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.440
You decide if you wanna
go to the next step.

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:04.949
What about the murders? You don't
give the fuck about them no more?

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:08.248
Look at me. Now look at you.

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:10.041
I never did.

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:47.070
Hey, I got the weight
on that dope finally.

01:24:47.165 --> 01:24:48.530
Thanks.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.412
That's all there was?

01:24:54.506 --> 01:24:56.872
I'll double check it
if you want.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.636
Don't matter. Still got
enough for felony.

01:25:03.724 --> 01:25:05.760
What are you guys
got going on today?

01:25:05.851 --> 01:25:09.764
Buying bust on fourth and
ferret on Andre's outfit.

01:25:09.855 --> 01:25:11.937
Happy hunting.

01:25:23.535 --> 01:25:28.120
Undercover just busted one on Andre's.
Fourth and ferret.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:30.948
What do you know?

01:25:31.043 --> 01:25:33.204
Man of your word.

01:25:34.421 --> 01:25:36.707
Are you running me
back to my car?

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:41.167
Yeah. I need to make a stop first.
Is that all right?

01:25:41.261 --> 01:25:43.172
Yes.

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:05.858
This, this is prime real estate.

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.817
Doesn't look prime.

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:11.121
See, that's the point. Now
is the time to get in.

01:26:11.208 --> 01:26:15.417
Two, three years from now, all
this we'll be river front condos.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:17.415
Marble floors, health spas.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:20.248
By that time, another
motherfucker made all the money.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:22.924
Don't be going legit
on me now, "big".

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:24.751
Money's money.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:28.009
Tell you what. You'll
be the front man,

01:26:28.100 --> 01:26:30.967
I'll be the power
behind the throne.

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:35.686
It's like we're working
for a greater good.

01:26:38.902 --> 01:26:40.984
This is a good spot
to build condominiums.

01:26:41.071 --> 01:26:44.689
See? I know I likes you, man.
Come on.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.137
May I ask you to step
out of the vehicle?

01:27:51.224 --> 01:27:52.464
What'd I do?

01:27:52.559 --> 01:27:54.515
You bought dope. I
watched you buy dope.

01:27:54.603 --> 01:27:56.594
Now stand the fuck up.

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:02.724
Put your hands on the car.

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:05.731
I didn't... 1 didn't
buy nothing, man.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.398
No? What's this?

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:10.699
Officer, please, let...

01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:12.026
Please what?

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:14.361
I don't know how
that shit got in there.

01:28:14.456 --> 01:28:15.536
Did I put it there?

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:16.955
No, sir.

01:28:17.042 --> 01:28:18.102
Just some freaking currants?

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:20.492
Yes, sir.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:22.498
That's what you
tell the judge, then.

01:28:22.589 --> 01:28:25.797
Maybe you'll get lucky and
he will be a football fan.

01:28:25.884 --> 01:28:27.294
You know who I am?

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:29.376
Oh, I know who you are.

01:28:29.471 --> 01:28:31.507
Then why you wanna
fuck my life up for?

01:28:31.598 --> 01:28:34.305
That's gonna knock me
out the draft.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:37.134
I'm sure you'll get a contract
of some kind eventually.

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:39.595
You run the 40 and what?
What's that, four-three?

01:28:41.274 --> 01:28:42.764
Why do you do this to me?

01:28:42.859 --> 01:28:45.771
For some motherfucking
marijuana, man.

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:48.228
I was gonna by my mama house.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:52.191
So, you're going off for six
points favorites against Texas.

01:28:52.327 --> 01:28:57.617
You win by five or less or you lose
altogether, none of this ever happened.

01:28:58.792 --> 01:29:00.407
Sir, I can't do that.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:03.832
A fumble, a missed blocking assignment.
You can absolutely do it.

01:29:03.922 --> 01:29:06.584
Sir, please. Please,
don't make me do that.

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.415
Listen to me, renaldo.

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.547
I dumped a lot of money
this year on you.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.343
I got the chance to get some of that
back, I wanna take advantage of it.

01:29:15.433 --> 01:29:18.891
You're gonna tell me the integrity of
the game is too much to you, fine.

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:22.228
I wouldn't dream of trying to convince
you to go against your conscience.

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:25.773
Turn around. I'm placing
you under arrest.

01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:29.695
You... you won't tell nobody.

01:29:32.117 --> 01:29:34.824
You ain't gonna tell nobody?

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:16.617
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. This that
Taliban shit. That's what's this is.

01:30:16.703 --> 01:30:20.036
That shit osama give a motherfucker
before they blow themselves up.

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:22.239
That's money. Money.

01:30:22.334 --> 01:30:24.290
Shut up!

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:27.327
Where's the 15,0007?

01:30:27.422 --> 01:30:29.834
You'll get it, man. Relax.

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:34.794
Did I not do what I
said I was going to do?

01:30:34.888 --> 01:30:38.380
Yeah, man. Relax.

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:42.013
Tell me again to relax.

01:30:44.064 --> 01:30:46.601
I'm not looking
to beat you, man.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:49.437
Where's my money?

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:50.642
I'll get your money.

01:30:50.737 --> 01:30:51.737
When?

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.780
Tomorrow.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:55.772
My place.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:30:59.159
Give me a cut of the uncut dope.

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.531
Look, I'm gonna
pay you in money.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.033
This is interest.

01:31:03.124 --> 01:31:04.614
That's bullshit, man.

01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:06.495
What's that, little man?

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:09.874
Midge, chill out.

01:31:09.965 --> 01:31:11.671
Here.

01:31:13.259 --> 01:31:16.968
Now, put that gun away
before you kill somebody.

01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.262
I'll kill all of you.

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:24.096
To the break of dawn.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:32.726
To the break of dawn, baby.

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:41.527
Wassup, wassup,
wassup wassup, motherfucker?

01:31:41.621 --> 01:31:43.953
No fucking bets, Terence.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.746
What's the matter?
You don't like me?

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:48.917
You don't pay your debts. I don't
wanna know you. I can't afford it.

01:31:49.004 --> 01:31:51.586
Ten grand! Five I owe.

01:31:51.673 --> 01:31:56.383
Yeah? Five for Louisiana.
Right there. Wassup?

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:57.754
Where did you get this?

01:31:57.846 --> 01:32:00.258
What, are you my priest?
Right there, here.

01:32:00.348 --> 01:32:01.758
You got it.

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:03.340
It's a six-point spread.

01:32:03.435 --> 01:32:05.175
No shit.

01:32:11.526 --> 01:32:13.391
Frankie?

01:32:19.951 --> 01:32:21.441
Frankie!

01:32:30.587 --> 01:32:32.168
Hey.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:33.961
I got something for you.

01:32:34.049 --> 01:32:35.914
I need to get my clothes.

01:32:36.009 --> 01:32:39.467
Don't worry about your clothes right now.
This is uncut dope.

01:32:39.596 --> 01:32:43.430
Just a bunch of stuff from my closet
and then from my dresser by the bed.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:47.722
I'm not gonna give you much until we know how
strong it is 'cause it's pure, you know?

01:32:47.812 --> 01:32:50.224
Baby, I've been talking
to your father a lot

01:32:50.315 --> 01:32:52.852
and I think I'm gonna go
to a meeting with him.

01:32:55.862 --> 01:32:59.730
What does that mean?
You don't want any?

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:03.817
I mean, of course I want some
but I, maybe when I get back.

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:07.496
Frankie. Frankie, we gofita go.

01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:11.082
Okay? Right.

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:11.471
Thank you.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:35.416
This the way to do business.

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:39.917
This, this way I ain't gotta worry
about what I'm walking into.

01:34:40.008 --> 01:34:42.169
I got you.

01:34:43.553 --> 01:34:45.544
Yeah, let me hit that shit.

01:34:53.062 --> 01:34:55.144
Yeah.

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:03.311
You hitting this shit?

01:35:05.033 --> 01:35:09.367
Hey, midget, light
the Caucasian's rock.

01:35:17.045 --> 01:35:20.287
You're my kind of
motherfucking cop, man.

01:35:20.381 --> 01:35:22.542
You're a crazy, motherfucker.

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.716
What did that ki run you.

01:35:25.803 --> 01:35:26.918
What do you care?

01:35:27.013 --> 01:35:28.298
I'm guessing 60,000.

01:35:28.389 --> 01:35:29.469
Very good guess.

01:35:29.557 --> 01:35:31.513
Will you shut the fuck up?

01:35:31.601 --> 01:35:35.344
You owe me 15 thousand. I'll
take 25% of the dope uncut.

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:37.224
That means you're
getting my price.

01:35:37.315 --> 01:35:39.772
It's one way of looking at it.

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:44.520
The other is, you get to keep 75% and not
go to prison for the rest of your life.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:51.993
Yeah.

01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:53.661
Go ahead.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.239
Make sure you cut that
shit before you sell it,

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:58.575
unless you wanna kill the
motherfucker who buys it.

01:35:58.670 --> 01:36:01.036
Did I ever tell you the
story about nigger elk?

01:36:01.130 --> 01:36:02.995
I was watching TV,
the game, right?

01:36:03.091 --> 01:36:06.128
Reynaldo Hayes, he got tossed the ball.
He was running with it.

01:36:06.219 --> 01:36:08.426
He jumped over three
linebackers in midair.

01:36:08.513 --> 01:36:11.676
He sprouted antlers
like a gazelle.

01:36:11.766 --> 01:36:13.222
Like an elk.

01:36:13.309 --> 01:36:15.015
He landed again.
He ran, ran, ran.

01:36:15.103 --> 01:36:16.343
He scored a touchdown!

01:36:19.107 --> 01:36:20.813
Crack talking.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:24.108
Listen, I'm not worried about you,
so don't be concerned about me.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:28.689
'Cause I'm not concerned if you're not
concerned. I'm not really concerned.

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:30.569
I'm worried 'cause
if you drop dead,

01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:32.946
I'm the motherfucker
they come looking for.

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.744
And then I gotta end up
having a nigger from Africa

01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:37.493
trying to move in on my shit.

01:36:37.583 --> 01:36:40.871
And I don't wanna shoot no more
purple ass niggers from Africa.

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:44.295
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
'Cause I'm not eazy-e.

01:36:46.175 --> 01:36:47.711
Fucking god.

01:36:47.802 --> 01:36:51.465
Hey. Hey. I need
fo go fo the store.

01:36:51.556 --> 01:36:52.671
So?

01:36:52.765 --> 01:36:54.130
So I need you to watch him.

01:36:54.225 --> 01:36:55.840
Fuck, no, I can't watch him.

01:36:55.935 --> 01:36:58.267
Don't be yelling. There
ain't nothin' to eat.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:01.057
Get the fuck outta here!

01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:02.810
Get the fuck outta here!

01:37:02.900 --> 01:37:05.642
Hit me again with another
one on them rocks.

01:37:08.114 --> 01:37:09.900
What the fuck's that?

01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:13.991
It's my lucky crack pipe.

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:15.739
You crazy motherfucker.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.912
You don't have
a lucky crack pipe?

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:21.457
No, I don't have a lucky
motherfucking crack pipe.

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:24.251
Then, Donald, you're gonna
take a hit of mine.

01:37:24.339 --> 01:37:26.375
Why I gotta do that?

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:28.331
'Cause it's lucky.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.802
Shit.

01:37:32.889 --> 01:37:35.175
Lucky crack pipe.

01:37:44.692 --> 01:37:48.560
Sorry we're late, fellas. I
hope you didn't wait dinner.

01:37:48.654 --> 01:37:50.394
Who the fuck are you?

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:52.446
Third party beneficiary.

01:37:52.533 --> 01:37:54.865
Your friend here can fill
you in on the details.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:37:57.864
I'm working on getting your money, Dave.
That's what I'm doing here.

01:37:57.955 --> 01:38:01.118
I don't know about you, but the
hardest part of collecting debts

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:02.949
is having to listen
to the sfories.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.500
Terence owes you some money?

01:38:04.587 --> 01:38:07.670
$50,000. Plus my two
young friends here

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:10.794
were supposed to have a sexual
experience of their choosing

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:15.219
with an attractive woman. Nothing.
He came across with none of it.

01:38:15.348 --> 01:38:19.637
That's wrong. That's wrong you don't do
what you say you're gonna do, Terence.

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.809
The dope's worth
more than 50,000.

01:38:23.064 --> 01:38:24.645
Take it.

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:27.394
Why don't I take all the dope?

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:30.443
Why are you gonna take
what belongs to me?

01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:32.862
Well, there was a time
when I wouldn't have.

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:36.032
I would've taken what was mine
and left the rest on the table.

01:38:36.119 --> 01:38:39.111
But, you see, I never got
rich enough to retire.

01:38:39.205 --> 01:38:42.868
I'm stuck doing this shit.

01:38:42.959 --> 01:38:45.120
And I'm not young anymore.

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:49.295
So now I don't leave
nothing on the table.

01:38:49.382 --> 01:38:51.088
Pick it up.

01:39:17.410 --> 01:39:18.900
Shoot him again.

01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:20.405
What for?

01:39:20.496 --> 01:39:22.703
His soul's still dancing.

01:39:46.439 --> 01:39:47.895
Shoot him again.

01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:21.170
Good night, lieutenant.

01:40:23.935 --> 01:40:25.300
What are you doing tonight?

01:40:25.394 --> 01:40:27.180
I'm getting outta
here and go to bed.

01:40:27.313 --> 01:40:30.555
Just for fun, why don't you stop
by the apartment on Josephine?

01:40:30.650 --> 01:40:32.015
For fun?

01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:34.100
You might find something
interesting there.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:35.901
Like what?

01:40:35.988 --> 01:40:39.355
These bushwhackers might've hit a
crack pipe while they were there.

01:40:39.492 --> 01:40:43.986
You know? The odd chance is he dropped
it under the bed where the kids were.

01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:45.661
And we missed it.

01:40:45.748 --> 01:40:48.581
The DNA'd place
them at the scene.

01:40:50.378 --> 01:40:52.164
You had a vision, right?

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:57.040
Deoxyribonucleic acid.

01:41:35.715 --> 01:41:38.172
Frankie? Frankie.

01:41:40.928 --> 01:41:42.964
Where's Frankie?
She's not in the house?

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:45.011
Frankie's on her way to rehab.

01:41:45.099 --> 01:41:46.805
Rehab?

01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:49.599
What about her clothes?

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:52.429
Someone will
bring her her clothes.

01:41:54.150 --> 01:41:56.607
Anything else you wanna know?

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:25.511
You don't have
to hide it from me.

01:42:26.557 --> 01:42:29.845
We're birds of a feather.

01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:32.642
We both like our poison.

01:42:34.357 --> 01:42:37.064
You just drink beer, I thought.

01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:27.990
Do you mind if I watch the game?

01:43:28.077 --> 01:43:30.864
Mh-mh. Be my guest.

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:45.125
I cannot believe
what I'm witnessing.

01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:48.211
Louisiana up by 18 points
in the second quarter.

01:43:48.305 --> 01:43:49.966
For another score.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:51.672
You wanna share?

01:43:51.767 --> 01:43:54.600
Back to pass. He scrambles.

01:43:54.687 --> 01:43:56.973
Hobbs builds his
way fo another...

01:43:57.064 --> 01:43:59.555
I don't know.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:04.523
And all this without
renaldo Hayes.

01:44:06.031 --> 01:44:08.238
We still don't know
the nature of his injury.

01:44:08.325 --> 01:44:10.316
Just that he's taken
himself out of the line.

01:44:10.411 --> 01:44:12.276
I'll kill him.

01:44:12.413 --> 01:44:15.826
Renaldo Hayes being oul, the freshman
Johnson has really stepped up

01:44:15.916 --> 01:44:19.124
for this football team. You're
in the land of miracles, my boy.

01:44:19.211 --> 01:44:21.998
I'm looking right there alt
Hayes, and I'll fell you what.

01:44:22.089 --> 01:44:26.378
The guy just does not look like a
happy guy. He's on the sideline.

01:44:26.469 --> 01:44:29.085
He's obviously suffering
from some sort of injury.

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.211
Hey, guys.

01:45:12.306 --> 01:45:14.388
Good to see you.

01:45:14.475 --> 01:45:15.760
Listen.

01:45:16.977 --> 01:45:19.559
This stuff, this
thing between us,

01:45:19.647 --> 01:45:23.060
it's gotten way out of hand.
Got way outta hand.

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.890
Okay?

01:45:24.985 --> 01:45:28.398
Those gumbos, couple
of fucking assholes.

01:45:28.489 --> 01:45:31.822
They disappeared because of
something you did to them.

01:45:31.909 --> 01:45:35.743
Whoa, man, I got no beef
with you whatsoever.

01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.822
Everything between me,
right as rain.

01:45:38.916 --> 01:45:40.577
And I want you to know

01:45:40.668 --> 01:45:43.205
that my father got in
touch with his guy

01:45:43.295 --> 01:45:45.251
and he told him whoever it is,

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:48.251
that complaint has been withdrawn.
Finished.

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:50.173
Oh, yeah.

01:45:50.261 --> 01:45:52.502
Okay?

01:45:54.515 --> 01:45:56.096
Okay.

01:45:57.184 --> 01:45:59.345
Oh, yeah?

01:46:01.063 --> 01:46:02.928
Uh, phew.

01:46:06.652 --> 01:46:08.313
Okay.

01:46:08.404 --> 01:46:09.894
That's the way out.

01:46:09.989 --> 01:46:11.650
Oh, yeah.

01:46:14.577 --> 01:46:16.442
Oh, no. Look, ned,

01:46:16.537 --> 01:46:19.199
if you'd called first, I
would've saved you the trip.

01:46:19.290 --> 01:46:23.533
I'm guessing that you
didn't see the game.

01:46:26.297 --> 01:46:28.128
How did this happen?

01:46:28.215 --> 01:46:31.628
Louisiana by three.

01:46:31.719 --> 01:46:33.835
Hayes ended up playing?

01:46:33.929 --> 01:46:35.339
Nope.

01:46:36.599 --> 01:46:37.839
Worked out anyway.

01:46:37.933 --> 01:46:39.469
What are you talking about?

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.800
Nothing.

01:46:40.895 --> 01:46:42.476
Oh,

01:46:42.563 --> 01:46:45.646
and my daughter's
tickets, speeding tickets,

01:46:45.733 --> 01:46:48.099
thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:46:48.193 --> 01:46:50.809
This female highway
patrol officer calls up,

01:46:50.905 --> 01:46:52.861
says they're taken care of.

01:46:55.659 --> 01:46:57.900
It's $10,000. Sure you
don't wanna count it?

01:46:57.995 --> 01:46:59.485
I trust you.

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.662
All right, man. You
take care or yourself.

01:47:01.749 --> 01:47:02.864
All right.

01:47:05.002 --> 01:47:06.583
Great news.

01:47:06.712 --> 01:47:09.704
Our man came up with this at
the crime scene on Josephine.

01:47:09.798 --> 01:47:11.459
I just got lucky.

01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:15.008
The lab found
godshaw's DNA on it.

01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:22.512
That is fantastic!

01:47:22.603 --> 01:47:24.639
Yes!

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:29.769
Oh, look at that.

01:47:57.429 --> 01:47:59.340
I found the spoon.

01:48:02.226 --> 01:48:03.887
It's not silver.

01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:07.436
It went rusty.

01:48:07.523 --> 01:48:09.559
I wanna give it to you.

01:48:11.402 --> 01:48:13.142
It's yours.

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:25.154
That's so sweet.

01:48:36.885 --> 01:48:38.500
It's beautiful.

01:48:50.441 --> 01:48:52.432
Yeah, I need eight of them.

01:48:52.526 --> 01:48:54.687
Yes, eight.

01:48:54.778 --> 01:48:58.612
Uh-huh. It's going down, baby.

01:48:58.699 --> 01:49:02.066
Yeah, I got some help.
I'm telling you.

01:49:02.161 --> 01:49:05.494
Police department. Stand up. Keep
your hands where we can see them.

01:49:05.581 --> 01:49:07.242
What the fuck is this?

01:49:07.332 --> 01:49:09.323
We got it. Check the outside,

01:49:09.418 --> 01:49:12.251
check the backyard, check
upstairs, check his car.

01:49:12.337 --> 01:49:14.953
We got this. It's okay. Good.
We're good. Upstairs.

01:49:15.049 --> 01:49:16.255
Cuff him.

01:49:16.341 --> 01:49:18.047
No.

01:49:19.553 --> 01:49:21.635
No.

01:49:21.722 --> 01:49:23.462
What do you mean no?

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:26.720
This is what happens. Before we can
cuff him, he goes for this weapon,

01:49:26.810 --> 01:49:28.766
we shoot this prick
and steal his shit.

01:49:28.854 --> 01:49:31.470
Fuck. Terence, what...
What are we doing?

01:49:33.692 --> 01:49:37.560
You're wrong, baby. He acts like he
likes you 'cause he likes fo get high.

01:49:37.654 --> 01:49:40.771
Huh? That don't mean
he stop bein' the police.

01:49:40.866 --> 01:49:42.151
Cuff him, Stevie.

01:49:42.242 --> 01:49:43.903
No. Can you draw
a line of murder?

01:49:43.994 --> 01:49:45.609
It's interesting
where to wreck its fun.

01:49:45.704 --> 01:49:47.990
I said cuff him, Stevie.

01:49:48.082 --> 01:49:50.368
This is about money.
You want my fucking money?

01:49:50.501 --> 01:49:54.335
You want my fucking money? Take my money!
You won't kill me for this shit.

01:49:54.421 --> 01:49:57.163
Go for it, son. Go for itl.

01:49:57.257 --> 01:49:58.997
Got for it. Go for it!

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:02.756
Yeah, yeah.

01:50:04.807 --> 01:50:06.672
Next time.

01:50:06.767 --> 01:50:09.224
Now fucking cuff him.

01:50:12.773 --> 01:50:15.890
I said cuff the
motherfucker, Stevie!

01:50:41.426 --> 01:50:46.136
Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to
conclude this year on a positive note.

01:50:46.223 --> 01:50:49.681
In recognition of his
leadership and tenacity

01:50:49.768 --> 01:50:52.726
in the investigation
of the ndele family murders

01:50:52.813 --> 01:50:56.397
resulting in the successful
apprehension and prosecution

01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:59.020
of the three
individuals responsible,

01:50:59.153 --> 01:51:04.739
I'm proud to include lieutenant Terence
McDonagh among those being promoted

01:51:04.825 --> 01:51:08.568
to the rank of captain.
Captain McDonagh.

01:51:16.336 --> 01:51:17.701
Woo!

01:51:34.479 --> 01:51:36.686
Excuse me. Would you
care for some wine?

01:51:36.773 --> 01:51:40.015
No, thank you. We're all gonna
stick with our sparkling water.

01:51:42.696 --> 01:51:45.187
I would like to make a toast.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.282
To the new captain.

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.734
To new life.

01:51:50.829 --> 01:51:53.115
I'm probably gonna start
to cry right now.

01:51:53.207 --> 01:51:55.323
Oh, that's okay.

01:51:56.627 --> 01:51:58.367
To my new family.

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:00.123
God bless.

01:52:00.214 --> 01:52:01.704
Here, here.

01:52:27.699 --> 01:52:31.317
You still gonna be working on night shift
when I get closer to the due date?

01:52:31.411 --> 01:52:34.653
I'll make sure I'm
not. How is that?

01:52:34.748 --> 01:52:39.663
I could get to the hospital and all,
but I like having you home at night.

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:42.085
I like it better that way, too.

01:53:19.293 --> 01:53:21.284
Thank you, darling.

01:53:46.778 --> 01:53:48.143
All right.

01:53:48.238 --> 01:53:49.694
There we go.

01:53:49.781 --> 01:53:51.396
Where are your keys?

01:53:51.491 --> 01:53:53.152
Did I give them to you?

01:53:53.243 --> 01:53:54.574
No, I don't think you did.

01:53:54.661 --> 01:53:55.992
Stand against the wall.

01:53:56.079 --> 01:53:57.194
What'd we do?

01:53:57.289 --> 01:53:58.745
Hey, stand against the wall.

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:00.447
What are you doing?

01:54:00.542 --> 01:54:03.659
The two of you match a description.
Passing drugs in the club.

01:54:03.754 --> 01:54:07.463
Don't say anything. Do exactly
what I tell you to do.

01:54:07.549 --> 01:54:10.006
So, what are we high on tonight?

01:54:10.093 --> 01:54:11.424
Nothing.

01:54:11.511 --> 01:54:14.469
Empty your pockets.
Dump out the handbag.

01:54:29.237 --> 01:54:30.943
Room service.

01:54:31.031 --> 01:54:33.272
I didn't order any room service.

01:54:33.367 --> 01:54:37.610
Oh. It must've been
a mistake again.

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:40.241
Holy shit.

01:54:40.332 --> 01:54:43.119
I'm evaristo Chavez, man.
You saved my life.

01:54:43.210 --> 01:54:45.952
I was in the prison
that was flooding.

01:54:46.046 --> 01:54:47.126
Oh, yeah.

01:54:47.214 --> 01:54:48.624
Do you remember me?

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:51.047
Are you still with
the police department?

01:54:51.134 --> 01:54:53.967
Port of call still New Orleans.

01:54:55.722 --> 01:54:57.007
Okay.

01:54:57.099 --> 01:54:59.090
What happened with you?

01:54:59.184 --> 01:55:01.675
The judge remanded to a
drug treatment program.

01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:04.807
November 14th
I have a year clean.

01:55:06.191 --> 01:55:08.307
Congratulations.

01:55:13.407 --> 01:55:15.739
Are you all right?

01:55:17.244 --> 01:55:20.407
Sometimes I have bad days.

01:55:23.125 --> 01:55:24.831
Listen,

01:55:24.918 --> 01:55:26.704
you saved my life.

01:55:26.795 --> 01:55:31.289
I'm almost done working. I'm
gonna get you out of here, okay?

01:55:31.383 --> 01:55:33.089
Okay?

01:55:36.430 --> 01:55:39.137
Do fish have dreams?

01:55:59.619 --> 01:56:01.780
You know, Chavez,

01:56:01.872 --> 01:56:05.285
I still hate that I ruined
my underwear for you.
