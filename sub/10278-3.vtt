E.R.

00:06.558 --> 00:08.150
Previously on E. R.

00:08.251 --> 00:09.527
I'm a drunk.

00:09.528 --> 00:10.897
How long have you been sober?

00:10.898 --> 00:12.133
Almost five years.

00:12.134 --> 00:13.979
So you can sponsor somebody.

00:13.980 --> 00:15.380
I'm pregnant.

00:15.381 --> 00:17.382
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

00:18.846 --> 00:20.609
We got a call
that you were trying to bounce him.

00:20.610 --> 00:22.411
- From whom?
- Anonymous

00:22.846 --> 00:27.143
- Dr. Romano, I felt I had to-
- Not a word, Peter. Not a single word.

00:27.144 --> 00:29.822
I was hoping you'd give me the joy
and honor...

00:29.823 --> 00:31.409
of being your husband.

00:31.710 --> 00:34.509
All right, so we'll put you on the schedule
for next week.

00:34.510 --> 00:37.258
Start out very light. No trauma.

00:37.659 --> 00:39.384
Whatever you say.

00:40.715 --> 00:43.825
E. R. 7x03 " MARS ATTACKS"

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.037 --> 01:14.911
Again. Clear!

01:15.081 --> 01:17.074
Go again. Clear!

01:18.126 --> 01:19.704
Still in V-fib.

01:19.878 --> 01:22.547
- Hey, Carter!
- Hey, Dave.

01:22.714 --> 01:23.912
- Good to see you.
- You too.

01:24.091 --> 01:25.799
- Yeah, you missed me?
- What happened to your hair?

01:25.968 --> 01:28.126
I've got to hop. The chief's training me
on the sternal saw today.

01:28.345 --> 01:30.053
Hope we get a GSW
who needs his chest cracked.

01:30.222 --> 01:32.131
I'll keep my fingers crossed for you.

01:32.307 --> 01:34.098
And this jerk just cut us off.

01:34.267 --> 01:37.968
And I rear-ended him,
and then the air bags went off.

01:40.858 --> 01:44.024
That's disgusting.
Hi, Carter.

01:44.194 --> 01:48.062
Glad you're back. She drinks anything
she can get her hands on.

01:48.240 --> 01:49.900
Probably psychogenic polydipsia.

01:50.075 --> 01:52.911
You want to check her lytes
and then call for a Psych consult.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.405
- Hey, Carter.
- Hey, Lily. How are you?

01:55.582 --> 01:57.824
Chuny, Weaver needs somebody
to make a blood run.

01:58.001 --> 02:00.207
Weaver needs to get
a couple more nurses.

02:00.378 --> 02:03.130
Can you tell we're short nurses?

02:09.137 --> 02:11.593
- Congratulations.
- John, welcome back.

02:11.765 --> 02:15.513
Hey, Carter! I got a live one
waiting in Exam 3.

02:15.685 --> 02:18.142
Freak tore off all her toenails
with a pair of pliers.

02:18.314 --> 02:20.639
What about me?
I need medical attention!

02:20.816 --> 02:24.316
- The only thing you need is a bath.
- I'll be there in a minute, Lydia.

02:38.001 --> 02:41.085
Hey, you.
Where do you think you're going?

02:41.254 --> 02:43.081
- I work here.
- No. That's an old ID.

02:43.256 --> 02:45.000
Well, I've been away.

02:45.175 --> 02:47.250
Dr. Weaver, does this one
belong to you?

02:47.427 --> 02:49.753
Yes, he does. He'll need to get
a new ID from personnel.

02:49.930 --> 02:53.465
- You can get it after your shift.
- Sorry, doc.

02:55.335 --> 02:57.641
- Why not Christmas?
- Next Christmas.

02:57.812 --> 02:58.928
No. This Christmas.

02:59.106 --> 03:01.431
Are you mad?
It takes months to plan a wedding.

03:01.608 --> 03:03.898
- Hey, Carter.
- Carter.

03:04.070 --> 03:06.145
- We got engaged.
- We bought a house.

03:06.322 --> 03:07.484
Wow.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.814
Congratulations on both accounts.

03:11.118 --> 03:13.360
Boy! I go away for a couple weeks...

03:13.537 --> 03:16.574
...you guys get engaged,
Chen's pregnant...

03:16.749 --> 03:18.625
...Malucci's blond, Admin looks different,

03:18.718 --> 03:20.745
and I can't remember my locker combination.

03:20.920 --> 03:25.333
The state medical board
made us clean it out. I'm sorry.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.168
Where's my stuff?

03:27.510 --> 03:30.512
Listen, I'll look into
getting your locker back.

03:30.681 --> 03:34.630
- But you can use mine until then.
- Look, I better run.

03:35.102 --> 03:37.675
There's a surgical conference today.
We're short-staffed.

03:37.854 --> 03:41.224
Please don't let your Residents call
for any unnecessary consults.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.775
- Good luck, Carter.
- Thank you.

03:42.943 --> 03:44.520
We'll talk dates later.

03:45.988 --> 03:48.740
You ready to rock 'n' roll?

03:48.907 --> 03:50.699
Yeah, I guess so.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.327
Listen, if you need anything...

03:52.495 --> 03:55.698
...talk about a case
or a patient or anything...

03:55.874 --> 03:58.543
- ... just come find me.
- I'll do that.

04:01.504 --> 04:03.129
I will.

05:12.286 --> 05:13.400
You got anything good?

05:13.578 --> 05:17.873
- Got a chest pain in 2 hooked up.
- I think Dr. Greene is free. Thanks, Lily.

05:18.042 --> 05:21.209
Sorry, Carter, but in order
to facilitate your return...

05:21.379 --> 05:24.083
- ... we need to implement a few rules.
- Such as?

05:24.256 --> 05:26.582
You're to do only minor medical,
no trauma.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.001
No suturing. No needles.
No narcotics.

05:29.178 --> 05:32.630
And absolutely no surgical procedures.

05:32.807 --> 05:33.838
That leaves me with...?

05:33.933 --> 05:36.010
The chance to practice medicine again.

05:36.186 --> 05:38.937
- Let me go!
- Settle down, Mr. DiBattista!

05:39.105 --> 05:41.312
- Let go of me!
- Hey!

05:41.383 --> 05:43.475
Give me some four-by-fours!

05:43.652 --> 05:46.439
- I think I know this guy.
- Stabilize his neck!

05:46.613 --> 05:49.614
- Leave me alone, bitch!
- All right, that's it!

05:52.494 --> 05:54.700
Once you get back
in the swing of things...

05:54.871 --> 05:57.956
...you can resume a normal schedule
and do procedures again.

05:58.125 --> 06:03.120
But until then, it's baby steps.
Why don't you start with Mr. Griffis?

06:04.340 --> 06:05.371
Gluteal rash.

06:05.549 --> 06:07.922
Nothing worse than a chapped ass,
or so I'm told.

06:08.094 --> 06:12.009
- Dr. Carter, when did you get out?
- A couple weeks ago.

06:14.684 --> 06:17.851
- Well, I got a patient.
- Go forth and heal.

06:18.021 --> 06:20.013
So who's watching
the drugstore cowboy?

06:20.190 --> 06:22.942
I'm head of the ER.
That makes Carter my responsibility.

06:23.110 --> 06:25.481
But didn't he develop
his drug addiction...

06:25.653 --> 06:27.446
- ... under your eye?
- Something you need?

06:27.614 --> 06:29.523
Do I need a reason to say hello?

06:29.700 --> 06:31.858
But now that I'm here,
perhaps you can tell me...

06:32.035 --> 06:36.033
...who replaced the candy in the vending
machines with raisins and rice cakes?

06:36.206 --> 06:38.495
You're here because you need
a sugar fix?

06:38.668 --> 06:41.953
We're a hospital. We're setting an
example by offering healthy snacks.

06:42.129 --> 06:45.961
Who are you, the nutrition Nazi? Poor
eating habits help keep us in business.

06:46.133 --> 06:49.218
- Did you even take the Hippocratic oath?
- I had my fingers crossed.

06:49.387 --> 06:51.593
- Dr. Romano?
- Dr. Chen.

06:51.764 --> 06:55.299
Well, I guess I don't have to ask
what you've been up to.

06:55.476 --> 06:59.012
- Look, I need a favor.
- If it's taking time off, talk to Weaver.

06:59.189 --> 07:01.726
Maternity leave is a topic
for those bearing ovaries.

07:01.900 --> 07:03.441
No. It's about my parents.

07:03.609 --> 07:05.768
I figured you'd run into them
at the conference.

07:05.946 --> 07:08.068
- I'll say hello.
- Well, actually...

07:08.239 --> 07:10.695
...I haven't told them I'm pregnant yet.

07:10.784 --> 07:13.571
I'd appreciate your not saying anything.

07:13.745 --> 07:15.952
- I want to surprise them.
- How?

07:16.123 --> 07:18.578
By going into labor at Sunday dinner?

07:19.502 --> 07:20.960
"Mom's" the word.

07:21.128 --> 07:22.788
Just a little longer, Mr. Griffis.

07:22.963 --> 07:25.918
I've already been here three hours.
How long is this gonna take?

07:26.092 --> 07:28.250
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for Weaver.

07:28.427 --> 07:30.634
She's under the impression
I'm her personal temp.

07:30.805 --> 07:32.085
- She's next door.
- Thanks.

07:32.265 --> 07:35.599
Is somebody gonna dig this wood
out of my butt before it sprouts roots?

07:35.769 --> 07:38.639
Would you mind, before you go,
removing some splinters?

07:38.813 --> 07:39.975
Can't you do it?

07:40.147 --> 07:42.306
Weaver won't let me use
any instruments.

07:42.484 --> 07:44.974
Okay. Sure. Just a minute.

07:45.153 --> 07:47.822
You need an ortho surgeon
for a closed reduction.

07:47.989 --> 07:50.112
I've been paging them for half an hour.

07:50.283 --> 07:52.323
Call the Attending,
tell them you're Weaver.

07:52.494 --> 07:55.994
- That usually will scare somebody down.
- Excuse me. Dr. Greene?

07:56.165 --> 07:59.284
I've got a 9-year-old who got hit
in the larynx with his skateboard.

07:59.459 --> 08:01.666
- He's pretty hoarse.
- Any sub-Q emphysema?

08:01.837 --> 08:03.462
No. Everything's okay.

08:03.630 --> 08:05.789
No stridor, good sats,
he's handling secretions.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.959
- He woke up with pain.
- Visualize his cords?

08:08.135 --> 08:10.128
Well, our scope is being serviced.

08:10.304 --> 08:13.222
I paged Head and Neck,
but I've been waiting three hours.

08:13.391 --> 08:16.926
Yes, it's moved to
the lower right quadrant. Yes.

08:17.103 --> 08:18.977
We have to scope him.
Call the Attending.

08:19.147 --> 08:22.765
Well, I tried, but they're either
in surgery or at some damn conference.

08:22.943 --> 08:25.350
He's too sick for a jump test!

08:25.528 --> 08:28.732
Hold on one second.
Dave, do you have a problem?

08:29.324 --> 08:31.565
Stewart's had two days
of vomiting and diarrhea.

08:31.743 --> 08:34.317
Corday says it's not a good story
for an appy.

08:34.496 --> 08:37.496
But now he's got classic signs:
guarding and rebound tenderness.

08:37.664 --> 08:40.501
- Did you tell her that?
- Yeah, but she won't come down.

08:40.669 --> 08:43.339
She wants me to make
this poor guy get up and jump around!

08:43.506 --> 08:45.830
Thanks, Elizabeth.
Follow me.

08:46.675 --> 08:49.214
Where are we going?
Where are we going?

08:49.387 --> 08:52.056
- Dr. Weaver, did you page me?
- Yes, Abby. Hi.

08:52.222 --> 08:54.975
- I need those in Exam 4.
- Why am I here?

08:55.142 --> 08:57.467
- We're short on nurses.
- I'm an OB nurse.

08:57.645 --> 08:59.887
- Planning on going back to med school?
- Yes.

09:00.064 --> 09:03.979
Then you might as well work in the ER.
You'll see more medicine here.

09:04.152 --> 09:05.480
Right, but I-

09:05.653 --> 09:07.562
I'm offering you
a learning opportunity...

09:07.738 --> 09:10.408
...that'll put you ahead
when you come back as a student.

09:10.575 --> 09:13.860
Which should only take me
about two more years.

09:14.036 --> 09:16.160
It's really not so bad down here, Abby.

09:16.331 --> 09:18.537
Yeah? Compared to what?

09:35.435 --> 09:38.768
Excuse me. I'm having trouble
with my card key.

09:40.482 --> 09:43.352
- What's the name?
- Dr. Peter Benton.

09:47.488 --> 09:49.695
You're not on the list.

09:51.118 --> 09:52.659
I just became a Surgical Attending.

09:52.827 --> 09:55.069
You're gonna have to park
on the street.

09:55.246 --> 09:58.117
- I'll park in the visitors' area.
- No, you said you work here.

09:58.291 --> 10:01.542
Employees can't park
in visitor spaces.

10:01.712 --> 10:04.333
Well, if I'm an employee,
then you have to let me in.

10:04.506 --> 10:07.922
I can't. You're not on the list.

10:10.804 --> 10:12.928
You've got a corneal abrasion.

10:13.099 --> 10:15.257
You mean pinkeye?

10:15.434 --> 10:18.471
No. You've got a scratch
on your eyeball.

10:18.646 --> 10:22.395
Probably some dirt got trapped
under the eyelid there.

10:22.567 --> 10:25.816
How on earth would that happen?

10:26.153 --> 10:29.819
I don't know.
Maybe the wind blew it in.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.449
Well, the last time I was in here
they said I had pinkeye.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.621
And crabs.

10:37.790 --> 10:40.745
I think I might have them again.

10:40.919 --> 10:44.004
Well, why don't we treat
one thing at a time?

10:45.841 --> 10:49.506
I'm gonna get antibiotics and put them
in your eye so it doesn't get infected.

10:49.678 --> 10:52.797
- Will it stop the hurting?
- We'll get you something for the pain.

10:52.973 --> 10:56.140
- Am I gonna get a patch?
- I'll see what I can do.

10:59.188 --> 11:00.267
- Hello.
- Elizabeth.

11:00.439 --> 11:02.977
Have you gone downstairs
to see that ruptured appy yet?

11:03.150 --> 11:04.479
I thought it was a rule-out.

11:04.652 --> 11:07.225
That was 10 minutes ago.
I'm sure it's ruptured by now.

11:07.405 --> 11:10.276
I told you there's a surgical conference,
and we're jammed.

11:10.450 --> 11:12.905
If Dr. Malucci fails to give me
a good enough story-

11:13.077 --> 11:15.070
I gave you a great story for an appy.

11:15.246 --> 11:18.282
When we call for a consult,
we need you to do just that.

11:18.458 --> 11:21.210
Well, thank you for the clarification.

11:22.128 --> 11:25.379
- What's this?
- Some things we need downstairs.

11:25.549 --> 11:28.549
Well, these "things" belong to the O.R.

11:28.718 --> 11:33.677
The surgeons can bring them back once
they come down to the ER to use them.

11:35.559 --> 11:37.717
Hello. I'm Dr. Chen.

11:37.895 --> 11:41.644
So, Willie, it says here
that you're having earaches.

11:41.816 --> 11:42.847
Yeah.

11:43.025 --> 11:45.776
Could you take off your hat
so I can have a look?

11:49.698 --> 11:53.234
- Gee! What happened?
- I couldn't stop the bleeding.

11:53.828 --> 11:56.533
- Who did this to you?
- I did.

11:56.706 --> 11:58.864
- With what?
- Kitchen shears.

11:59.042 --> 12:00.417
On purpose?

12:00.960 --> 12:02.834
- Didn't it hurt?
- What do you think?

12:03.004 --> 12:05.756
I tried to numb it with ice,
but they're still pretty sore.

12:05.923 --> 12:07.253
Yeah, I bet.

12:07.426 --> 12:09.751
Now, why would you give yourself
Doberman ears?

12:09.928 --> 12:12.170
- They're Vulcan.
- Is that like a Shih Tzu?

12:12.348 --> 12:15.763
No, I think he means like Mr. Spock.

12:16.184 --> 12:17.430
On Star Trek.

12:17.603 --> 12:19.809
Right, right...

12:19.980 --> 12:21.474
Okay.

12:21.648 --> 12:24.815
We'll irrigate the wounds,
wrap them in saline gauze.

12:24.985 --> 12:27.274
Give him a DT
and run in a gram of Ancef.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.569
- Psych consult?
- Yes. And I'll call Plastics.

12:29.740 --> 12:32.776
Psych? Wait a second.
But I'm not crazy.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.611
You mutilated yourself
with kitchen shears.

12:35.788 --> 12:38.458
How long is it gonna take?
The sci-fi convention's today.

12:38.625 --> 12:42.242
- I'm already running pretty late.
- We're moving at warp speed here.

12:46.132 --> 12:50.426
- Hey, I got a present for you.
- What?

12:50.595 --> 12:54.095
One fiber-optic laryngoscope,
compliments of the O.R.

12:54.266 --> 12:57.635
- Where did you get this?
- You're better off not knowing.

12:57.811 --> 13:01.512
So you pick out a name
for the little bambino yet?

13:01.690 --> 13:03.101
No.

13:03.692 --> 13:04.807
Let me get that.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.856
You planning on something Chinese
or a little bit more Western?

13:08.030 --> 13:09.655
I haven't given it much thought.

13:09.824 --> 13:11.863
- Hey, you got a minute?
- Sure.

13:12.034 --> 13:13.908
Got a corneal abrasion
that needs Vicodin...

13:14.077 --> 13:15.656
...and I'm not allowed to write for it.

13:15.830 --> 13:18.996
Yeah, I'll take it. There's an otitis
in Exam 2 you can have.

13:19.166 --> 13:20.661
He presents it as pinkeye.

13:20.835 --> 13:22.495
- But all he needs is the meds.
- Okay.

13:22.670 --> 13:25.837
And wear this mask, because
he's pretty rank, and he's got crabs.

13:26.007 --> 13:28.379
Are you going soft on me, Carter?

13:28.551 --> 13:31.256
God! It looks like I missed a few things
while I was away.

13:31.430 --> 13:32.461
Yeah.

13:32.639 --> 13:35.390
- So how far along are you?
- Twenty-four weeks.

13:35.559 --> 13:39.177
- Was this planned, or...
- No. Not particularly.

13:39.354 --> 13:41.181
You know, I gotta run.

13:41.940 --> 13:43.767
Sit still so the doctor can look
at your hand.

13:43.942 --> 13:45.057
It hurts.

13:45.235 --> 13:48.651
We'll give you medicine to make it better
but let us clean out the germs first.

13:48.822 --> 13:51.194
Irrigate the wound
and start him on Augmentin.

13:51.367 --> 13:54.985
- Gloria, this looks like a human bite.
- His Uncle Charlie bit him.

13:55.162 --> 13:57.654
- Did you call Social Services?
- That's Uncle Charlie.

13:57.832 --> 14:02.541
- Albert's my grandson. Charlie's mine.
- You're babysitting?

14:02.712 --> 14:05.499
24/7 for the past two years,
if you call that babysitting.

14:05.673 --> 14:08.378
Her daughter got involved with someone
with a drug problem.

14:08.551 --> 14:10.876
She got pregnant. I got Albert.

14:11.053 --> 14:14.423
- How long have you had that cough?
- A couple months.

14:14.599 --> 14:16.223
It comes and goes.

14:16.392 --> 14:18.386
- Do you smoke?
- Yeah.

14:18.562 --> 14:20.934
But I go outside.
I don't light up around the kids.

14:21.106 --> 14:23.265
Okay. I'd like to get a chest x-ray.

14:23.442 --> 14:25.767
I'm fine. I just need you
to look at Albert's hand.

14:25.944 --> 14:28.352
It'll only take a few minutes.
As long as you're here.

14:28.531 --> 14:30.737
- What about Albert and Charlie?
- I can take them to Daycare.

14:30.908 --> 14:33.067
- You don't have to do that.
- It's not a problem.

14:33.244 --> 14:34.952
Come on. Let's go to the playroom.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.362
I'll get a PA and a lateral chest
on Gloria.

14:37.539 --> 14:39.283
Okay, let's go.

14:39.458 --> 14:40.869
Thanks.

14:42.378 --> 14:45.581
Grandma! Grandma!
Uncle Charlie bit the nurse!

14:47.174 --> 14:49.666
Is everything gone crazy?
I can't log on to the system.

14:49.844 --> 14:50.875
Forget your password?

14:51.054 --> 14:52.880
- Dr. Romano!
- Peter, you're still here.

14:53.055 --> 14:56.425
I had problems getting into the garage.
Now I can't get onto the computer.

14:56.601 --> 14:58.095
- You didn't get my letter?
- What letter?

14:58.269 --> 15:00.558
- Your privileges have been revoked.
- What?

15:00.730 --> 15:03.897
Yeah, you remember that
dialysis patient of yours?

15:04.067 --> 15:05.526
Fletcher, that's right.

15:05.694 --> 15:08.944
Your tattletaling to the inspector
general cost me a $50,000 fine...

15:09.114 --> 15:11.985
- ... which my insurance doesn't cover.
- I was looking out for my patient.

15:12.159 --> 15:14.696
You also cost the hospital
an EMTALA fine.

15:14.870 --> 15:17.159
I had to recoup those monies
somewhere.

15:17.331 --> 15:20.083
I was forced to eliminate
the Attending position.

15:20.251 --> 15:22.872
Hold on. We can't talk
about this in private?

15:23.045 --> 15:26.664
Why? You didn't seem to feel the need
to talk in private about our problem.

15:26.841 --> 15:29.628
You just decided to go off on your own.
So now you are.

15:29.802 --> 15:33.385
- So, what is my position here?
- You have no position here, Peter.

15:33.556 --> 15:36.261
- You're firing me?
- No, no, no.

15:36.434 --> 15:38.640
You fired yourself.

15:45.276 --> 15:48.811
Hey, Cleo. How are you at getting
insects out of little boys' ears?

15:48.989 --> 15:51.611
Keep him still.
I'll get to him in a minute.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.201
I brought her in with a sore throat.

16:01.376 --> 16:04.710
That was three weeks ago.
She's still not getting any better.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.039
- Where are we?
- I see tonsilar exudates.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.794
- What's that?
- Excuse me.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.541
- It's pus.
- Gross.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.132
Yeah. It looks like strep.

16:13.306 --> 16:15.761
Did you take all the medication
the doctor prescribed?

16:15.933 --> 16:18.306
- Yes.
- She can't miss any more school.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.514
I'm going to order a couple of tests
to rule out other infections.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.525
Rapid strep, mono spot,
Gram's stain and culture?

16:24.693 --> 16:26.768
- That'll do it. Thanks.
- Yep.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.693
Abby, can you find a room
for Mr. Duncan here?

16:32.867 --> 16:35.537
Sure. Excuse me.

16:35.704 --> 16:37.495
I need you to suture a head lac, Abby.

16:37.664 --> 16:40.072
- I can't do that now. I'm a nurse.
- I forgot.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.326
- Can you clean it up for me?
- In a minute.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.496
Abby, just the person I wanted to see.

16:44.672 --> 16:46.249
Bear attack.

16:46.423 --> 16:48.581
I've got businessmen
with food poisoning.

16:48.759 --> 16:51.167
Shoot them up with Compazine
and plug them into IVs.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.717
You might want to call Housekeeping
for some buckets.

16:53.889 --> 16:57.175
- Buckets?
- It was an all-you-can-eat buffet.

16:57.893 --> 17:01.310
- Anybody else need anything?
- If I'm being arrested, I get a phone call.

17:01.481 --> 17:03.390
- You'll get it.
- There's a phone upstairs.

17:03.566 --> 17:06.402
- Why are you letting them move him?
- He's wanted for murder.

17:06.569 --> 17:07.944
Lucky I recognized him.

17:08.112 --> 17:10.900
- Once a cop, always a cop.
- This is not a police department.

17:11.074 --> 17:12.865
They can observe him in the jail ward.

17:13.034 --> 17:15.277
If people don't feel safe,
they'll stop coming...

17:15.454 --> 17:16.781
...when they need medical attention.

17:16.954 --> 17:18.948
- Only the criminals.
- I'm not talking to you.

17:19.124 --> 17:20.583
I think we're done here, Frank.

17:20.751 --> 17:24.084
- I was still observing him.
- Freaking liberal foreigners.

17:24.421 --> 17:26.378
It's my decision to transfer or not.

17:26.549 --> 17:28.540
He's a threat to patients and staff.

17:28.717 --> 17:30.924
He needs to be in custody.
That's my decision.

17:31.095 --> 17:32.755
Hey, it's not so bad down here.

17:32.930 --> 17:35.006
I'm gonna give you some antibiotics.

17:35.182 --> 17:37.638
But the next time
that you want to pierce your nipples...

17:37.810 --> 17:39.601
...go to a professional, okay?

17:39.770 --> 17:42.262
- You almost finished? I need the bed.
- Yeah.

17:44.275 --> 17:46.564
- Hey, how's it going?
- Great.

17:46.736 --> 17:50.436
Actually, it sucks.
I'm not allowed to do anything.

17:51.199 --> 17:52.231
Well...

17:55.286 --> 17:57.031
Easy does it?

17:57.206 --> 18:01.155
- You might want to give yourself time.
- Time and scut. I got plenty of both.

18:01.334 --> 18:02.913
- It could be worse.
- How's that?

18:03.087 --> 18:05.838
Did you have to pluck maggots
out of anybody's crotch today?

18:06.006 --> 18:09.173
- I had a guy with crabs.
- That's not even close.

18:09.343 --> 18:13.127
- Anything interesting on the big board?
- A UTI in Exam 2.

18:13.306 --> 18:16.223
I was hoping for something more
than a bladder infection.

18:16.392 --> 18:19.476
- There are no small patients, Carter.
- What about dwarves?

18:19.645 --> 18:23.975
- You've known Jing-Mei for a while.
- I knew her before she was Jing-Mei.

18:24.150 --> 18:26.024
So do you know
who got her pregnant?

18:26.194 --> 18:30.939
- Even if I did, I don't know if I'd tell you.
- That's not a definitive no.

18:31.115 --> 18:33.072
You two haven't been...

18:34.453 --> 18:35.828
Yeah.

18:35.996 --> 18:39.495
Sometimes this medicine
can give you muscle spasms.

18:42.919 --> 18:46.086
Don't worry. That's easily reversed
with Benadryl.

18:52.513 --> 18:56.926
And I'm sure you'll all feel much better
after you're rehydrated. Okay?

18:57.101 --> 19:00.719
- Abby, you need a hand in here?
- Everything's under control.

19:00.897 --> 19:02.723
How did you become paralyzed?

19:02.898 --> 19:04.641
I was hit by a car.

19:05.568 --> 19:08.652
On my bike. I would've been killed
if I wasn't wearing a helmet.

19:09.655 --> 19:13.025
- You were lucky.
- You know, I didn't used to think so.

19:13.201 --> 19:16.451
But now I come to the hospital,
and I see kids way worse off than me.

19:16.621 --> 19:20.536
It says on your chart you think you
might have a urinary tract infection.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.452
Does it burn when you pee?

19:22.627 --> 19:25.748
I don't know.
I don't feel much below my waist.

19:25.923 --> 19:29.422
But I can feel pressure on my stomach
when I need to go.

19:29.593 --> 19:31.337
That's when I know
to catheterize myself.

19:31.512 --> 19:33.220
And how often do you do that?

19:33.388 --> 19:35.547
About every six to eight hours.

19:35.724 --> 19:37.682
But lately I've been having
to do it more...

19:37.852 --> 19:40.010
...which is usually a sign
I have an infection.

19:40.187 --> 19:44.232
- You put in your own catheters?
- My grandmother used to help me.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.318
She passed away in February.

19:47.487 --> 19:52.066
- Who takes care of you now?
- I live in a retirement home.

19:52.575 --> 19:54.402
It used to be me
and my grandmother...

19:54.577 --> 19:58.445
...and now it's just me.
I know that sounds really lame.

19:58.623 --> 20:00.699
But it's across the street
from my school...

20:00.875 --> 20:04.410
...and some of the old folks don't get
a lot of visits from their families.

20:04.588 --> 20:06.710
It's kind of like having
20 grandparents.

20:07.591 --> 20:09.418
Yeah, it is.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.096
Okay. You might need
some antibiotics.

20:13.264 --> 20:17.213
I'm gonna have a nurse come in
and get a urine sample.

20:18.102 --> 20:22.514
That's okay. I can do it myself.
I'm used to doing stuff like that myself.

20:22.856 --> 20:25.811
I'm gonna have a nurse
come in and help, okay?

20:29.614 --> 20:31.939
I seem to be a magnet
for the weird ones today.

20:32.116 --> 20:34.193
Why? What's up with this guy?

20:34.702 --> 20:37.240
Where did this water come from?

20:37.413 --> 20:40.201
Mr. Kamatovik, what did I tell you?

20:40.375 --> 20:42.663
I found him soaking his blanket
in the sink.

20:42.835 --> 20:44.414
I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to make a mess.

20:44.588 --> 20:48.715
- Mr. Kamatovik, why is your blanket wet?
- I was afraid I was gonna burn.

20:48.883 --> 20:52.418
I have a family history of spontaneous
human combustion.

20:52.596 --> 20:53.627
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:53.805 --> 20:56.510
I gotta stay wet, or I'm gonna go up
like a Roman candle.

20:56.725 --> 21:00.059
Get that oxygen away unless you want
this whole place to explode!

21:00.229 --> 21:04.178
Mr. Kamatovik, please just sit and relax.
I'll turn off the oxygen in the hall.

21:04.358 --> 21:05.390
Dr. Chen...

21:05.568 --> 21:09.316
Let's get Mr. Kamatovik started
on a flame-retardant saline...

21:09.488 --> 21:11.730
...and get somebody
from the special burn unit.

21:11.908 --> 21:13.236
Yes. Okay.

21:13.409 --> 21:15.983
Don't worry, Mr. Kamatovik.
We've got you covered. Okay?

21:16.204 --> 21:17.995
Hey, chief!

21:20.249 --> 21:24.033
- Malucci, you okay?
- Yeah. There's a multi-trauma coming in.

21:24.212 --> 21:26.786
A causeway collapsed
at a sci-fi convention. I'm good.

21:29.342 --> 21:33.043
Spin a crit, dip a urine. C-spine,
chest and pelvis. I'll be right there.

21:33.221 --> 21:35.012
- You okay, Cleo?
- So far, so good.

21:35.181 --> 21:38.633
We had to double up. First one's
a forearm fracture from falling concrete.

21:38.810 --> 21:41.348
- Open or closed?
- Closed. The neuro-circ is intact.

21:41.522 --> 21:45.104
Got a 10-centimeter scalp lac.
No LOC. Olbes got a bad one in 43.

21:45.275 --> 21:47.683
- What's this?
- Looks like a dislocated shoulder.

21:47.862 --> 21:51.775
- Neck pain with mid-line tenderness.
- BP, 125/78. Pulse, 90.

21:51.950 --> 21:53.325
- You got it?
- Yeah.

21:53.492 --> 21:54.572
Where do you need me?

21:54.744 --> 21:56.866
Triage the most critical patients
to the beds.

21:57.037 --> 21:58.236
You got it.

21:58.414 --> 22:01.664
23-year-old man, crushed pelvis,
fell at least 20 feet.

22:01.834 --> 22:03.874
Danny. Danny, where is he?

22:04.045 --> 22:05.872
- Who's Danny?
- He's my brother.

22:06.047 --> 22:07.957
- He was next to me.
- I think Morales got him.

22:08.133 --> 22:10.884
He didn't want to go today.
I made him.

22:11.052 --> 22:13.045
- Danny.
- Looks like a bad tib-fib.

22:13.222 --> 22:16.720
- Please, don't let him die.
- Let's take care of you first, sir.

22:16.891 --> 22:18.635
What's your name?

22:19.228 --> 22:21.897
Sir? Sir, open your eyes.

22:22.063 --> 22:24.935
- Losing the pulse.
- Okay, let's go.

22:27.527 --> 22:29.319
Blunt chest trauma, tachy at 120.

22:29.488 --> 22:31.481
Decreased breath sounds
on the left. Abby?

22:31.657 --> 22:33.400
I said we could handle one major.

22:33.575 --> 22:35.782
They've got 30 critical patients
on scene.

22:35.953 --> 22:38.076
I told them we'd take three major
and 10 minor.

22:38.247 --> 22:40.406
How can we,
if we don't have any surgeons?

22:40.583 --> 22:42.789
We can stabilize and triage them
one at a time.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.630
I hope that we can, Mark.
Frank, page the surgeons.

22:45.797 --> 22:47.374
- They're at the conference.
- Page them.

22:47.548 --> 22:49.173
- Hey, can I help?
- No.

22:49.341 --> 22:51.086
- You're slammed.
- All the more reason...

22:51.261 --> 22:53.419
...for you to take the minor medicals.
No trauma.

22:53.596 --> 22:57.546
- Dr. Weaver, we need you in Trauma 1.
- Let's take him to Curtain Area 2.

22:57.726 --> 22:59.006
Give me the greatest hits.

22:59.185 --> 23:02.471
32-year-old male. Walkway fell.
Crushed his right foot under a girder.

23:02.647 --> 23:03.976
- What's wrong?
- Open fracture.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.525
Bleeding through the perineum.

23:05.693 --> 23:08.563
- Pressure's down to 60.
- I'll put in a central line.

23:08.737 --> 23:11.489
- How's the other patient?
- They're putting in a chest tube.

23:11.657 --> 23:13.317
Elizabeth, you should go check
on him.

23:13.492 --> 23:15.484
I can't leave this patient.
Where's Peter?

23:15.661 --> 23:17.535
- Didn't Romano fire him?
- What?

23:17.705 --> 23:20.955
No, I saw him earlier.
Try paging him.

23:21.125 --> 23:24.079
- Go on. I can handle this.
- He needs a MAST suit inflated...

23:24.253 --> 23:28.962
...a suprapubic Foley, and either a
pelvic embolization or a external fixator.

23:29.133 --> 23:31.921
You can't do all of that.
I'm not leaving until he's stable.

23:32.095 --> 23:35.214
The other patient has a blunt chest
trauma. He might be bleeding out.

23:35.389 --> 23:37.632
If he is, I'm sure Dr. Kovac
will come get me.

23:37.809 --> 23:40.929
- Get me a 3-0 nylon and an OpSite.
- Got it.

23:41.104 --> 23:43.595
Tell Mark Greene
we are closed to trauma!

23:43.774 --> 23:47.523
Urine dip is negative for blood.
Hemoglobin's 11.6.

23:47.695 --> 23:49.651
- Get him a unit bed.
- Working on it.

23:49.821 --> 23:54.448
- Third liter of saline up at 15: 10.
- Pressure's down to 60. Tachy at 130.

23:54.618 --> 23:58.319
I have some breath sounds on the left.
20 of etomidate, 10 of Norcuron.

23:58.497 --> 24:01.913
I'll intubate. Abby, prep
for a chest tube on the left.

24:03.002 --> 24:05.078
- Suction.
- Open a Steri-Drape.

24:07.339 --> 24:10.257
Too much edema.
I need the fiber-optic scope.

24:10.426 --> 24:14.590
- Abby, put in the chest tube.
- I can't. I'm a nurse.

24:14.764 --> 24:17.337
- This guy needs a chest tube.
- You're gonna have to do it.

24:17.517 --> 24:20.388
It's a tough intubation.
You know how.

24:20.562 --> 24:21.842
Go!

24:24.483 --> 24:25.645
Ten blade.

24:25.817 --> 24:27.810
Hey, hey! Get back in bed,
Mr. Kamatovik.

24:27.986 --> 24:29.979
You're not supposed to be here.

24:30.155 --> 24:31.400
Are you feeling better?

24:31.573 --> 24:35.571
There was probably a lot of dust.
It aggravated your asthma.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.197
All right. 60 of prednisone.

24:38.372 --> 24:41.492
Repeat nebs in 30 minutes.
It's like Mars Attacks in here.

24:41.667 --> 24:43.125
23-year-old male with hip pain.

24:43.293 --> 24:47.161
BP's 130/85, pulse, 110.
There's no obvious deformity.

24:47.339 --> 24:48.999
Okay. Let's cut this off, please.

24:49.174 --> 24:52.129
- No! Don't cut my costume!
- I need to take a look at your hip.

24:52.303 --> 24:54.710
- The zipper's in the back.
- Fine. Unzip Zontar here.

24:54.889 --> 24:57.843
Titrate 10 of morphine and get
an AP pelvis and a right hip film.

24:58.017 --> 25:00.009
- Where the hell is Benton?
- I think he quit.

25:00.187 --> 25:03.887
We got a bad tib-fib fracture,
and he's losing foot pulses.

25:04.065 --> 25:05.227
We gotta get him to the O.R.

25:05.400 --> 25:08.484
We're short surgeons.
I thought we were closing to traumas.

25:08.653 --> 25:10.528
- Too late for that now.
- I'll get Corday.

25:10.698 --> 25:12.192
Liver and spleen look good.

25:12.366 --> 25:14.405
Bleeding is limited to the pelvis.

25:14.618 --> 25:16.907
We've got a patient with
probable compartment syndrome.

25:17.079 --> 25:20.661
- Do your best to stabilize him.
- Then we need the digital Stryker.

25:20.832 --> 25:22.909
- Call upstairs.
- No, no. It's under the sink.

25:23.085 --> 25:24.959
Dr. Greene borrowed it from the O.R.

25:25.170 --> 25:26.202
Stole it, more like.

25:26.381 --> 25:30.081
Never mind. Let him use it. Just tell him
I want the results of the readings.

25:30.259 --> 25:31.635
Systolics are down to 70.

25:31.803 --> 25:33.760
Another two units of packed cells.

25:33.930 --> 25:36.598
Dr. Weaver, cops are coming
to arrest your pneumonia mom.

25:36.766 --> 25:38.759
- For what?
- For writing bad checks.

25:40.228 --> 25:42.517
- Elizabeth, you okay for a minute?
- Yeah, go.

25:45.400 --> 25:48.734
- Hey, did somebody get hurt?
- Yeah.

25:50.363 --> 25:52.653
Did that nurse come in
and get the urine sample?

25:52.825 --> 25:54.283
No. What happened?

25:54.451 --> 25:57.404
A walkway collapsed
over at the Tarver Center.

25:57.580 --> 26:00.829
Run two units O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Type and cross for four more.

26:00.999 --> 26:03.787
- A lot of people got hurt.
- Yeah.

26:03.961 --> 26:08.208
That's too bad. I bet they never
saw it coming. I sure didn't.

26:09.050 --> 26:12.050
Okay. Let's get you up here.

26:15.640 --> 26:19.175
I'm sorry. I would've cathed myself,
but I was waiting for the nurse.

26:19.352 --> 26:21.890
It's okay. No big deal, Dennis.

26:22.063 --> 26:24.103
I'll get to him in a minute, Carter.

26:24.274 --> 26:27.191
That's all right, I got this.
They need you in the trauma rooms.

26:27.360 --> 26:29.768
- You sure?
- Yeah, go.

26:30.447 --> 26:34.148
You know, most doctors
don't like to do this stuff.

26:35.118 --> 26:38.321
All right, let's get you out
of those wet clothes.

26:38.496 --> 26:40.240
BP's stable at 140/90.

26:40.416 --> 26:43.037
It's increasing in all three compartments.

26:43.210 --> 26:47.671
- His leg is cool.
- He's losing circulation to the foot.

26:54.888 --> 26:57.759
Gloria, this is the Zithromax.

26:57.933 --> 27:01.303
Take two tomorrow, then one a day
for the next four days.

27:01.479 --> 27:03.021
Is something wrong?

27:03.189 --> 27:05.645
The police are on their way
to pick you up.

27:05.817 --> 27:08.568
- What?
- They have a warrant out for your arrest.

27:08.736 --> 27:11.524
Sometimes I have to bounce a check
to buy some time.

27:11.698 --> 27:15.529
But I usually pay everything off in time.
I've got two jobs.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.371
I understand. Here we go.
Right this way.

27:18.538 --> 27:22.868
Daycare- Honey, Daycare
is up this way. The fourth floor!

27:23.043 --> 27:24.870
Thanks for everything!

27:25.045 --> 27:28.046
- Kerry.
- Tell me that you're here to help out.

27:28.215 --> 27:31.251
No, but I will take Mr. Kamatovik
to Psych once a bed's available.

27:31.426 --> 27:34.712
I appreciate that, but we could
really use an extra pair of hands.

27:34.888 --> 27:37.462
Sorry, we've got our own problems.
Tonight's a full moon.

27:37.642 --> 27:42.055
Stop by later if you want.
It'll be like Mardi Gras.

27:47.067 --> 27:49.226
Anterior compartment pressure is 68.

27:49.404 --> 27:51.195
- That's not good.
- Normal is 30.

27:51.364 --> 27:52.740
He needs a fasciotomy now.

27:52.908 --> 27:56.074
- You're gonna do this?
- I did one in med school...

27:56.244 --> 27:58.533
- ... on a cadaver.
- You can't do it down here.

27:58.705 --> 28:01.112
If we don't,
he's gonna need an amputation.

28:01.291 --> 28:04.078
Get Corday on the intercom.

28:06.254 --> 28:07.962
- Dr. Corday?
- What is it?

28:08.131 --> 28:11.832
- Got the pressures.
- An average reading: 65.

28:12.010 --> 28:14.762
- I have to open the compartments.
- Yeah, well, we' re ready.

28:14.930 --> 28:17.551
This guy's bleeding from his pelvis.
You'll have to wait.

28:17.724 --> 28:20.430
Can't wait. We've lost foot pulses.

28:20.936 --> 28:23.142
- Can you get another surgeon?
- No one's here.

28:23.313 --> 28:25.686
You're gonna have
to talk me through this.

28:25.858 --> 28:30.236
- Well, I don't think I can.
- You 're gonna have to, Elizabeth.

28:34.033 --> 28:37.237
- Another 0-silk, please.
- What are you doing?

28:38.413 --> 28:39.576
Sewing in a chest tube.

28:39.748 --> 28:43.116
When I said you'd get more experience
down here, this is not what I meant.

28:43.293 --> 28:46.128
Nurses do not sew in chest tubes.
Do they, Dr. Kovac?

28:46.296 --> 28:48.289
- She knows how.
- Of course.

28:48.465 --> 28:50.873
But our malpractice insurance
no longer covers her...

28:51.051 --> 28:54.301
...doing anything outside the scope
of normal nursing practices.

28:54.471 --> 28:58.220
We were short-handed. The patient
could have died if she hadn't put it in.

28:58.392 --> 29:01.144
You let her put in the chest tube?
It's your responsibility...

29:01.312 --> 29:03.637
...if anything goes wrong!

29:03.814 --> 29:05.807
- She did a great job.
- That's not the point.

29:05.984 --> 29:07.857
- You should've called me.
- You were busy.

29:08.027 --> 29:09.307
- Step back.
- I'm almost done.

29:09.487 --> 29:11.231
Step back!

29:11.406 --> 29:14.027
Get Corday some Pavulon.

29:18.871 --> 29:20.745
I need some Pavulon.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.996
- How's it going in there?
- I'll live.

29:24.169 --> 29:27.289
Hey, do you know if we have
any extra-small scrubs in here?

29:27.464 --> 29:29.172
Sure they'll fit you?

29:29.341 --> 29:32.627
I got a paraplegic kid with a UTI
who just wet himself.

29:32.803 --> 29:35.340
I want to give him something
to change into.

29:35.514 --> 29:39.298
Well, don't ask me. I didn't even know
I was working here till today.

29:41.186 --> 29:44.353
- I swear, I can't win with Weaver.
- Well, who can?

29:44.899 --> 29:47.354
She drags me down here
claiming it's for my benefit...

29:47.527 --> 29:50.196
...so I can get more experience,
but not too much.

29:50.362 --> 29:52.106
- Talk to your nurse manager.
- Right.

29:52.281 --> 29:55.484
Then Weaver completely hates me
if I ever come back as a med student.

29:55.660 --> 29:57.782
- You'll come back.
- I don't know if I want to.

29:57.954 --> 30:00.030
- This place is a freak show.
- It grows on you.

30:00.206 --> 30:01.949
So does foot fungus.

30:02.124 --> 30:05.708
Abby, give Mr. Palmer a CBC, urine dip,
myoglobin, and put in a Foley.

30:05.879 --> 30:09.213
- Which one's Palmer?
- Three-hundred-pounder with blue skin.

30:09.383 --> 30:12.585
Excellent. Fat and colorful.
Here.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.884
Well, at least you got
something to do.

30:15.055 --> 30:17.131
I'll trade you Jabba the Hutt for the UTI.

30:17.307 --> 30:18.765
I said I was bored, not desperate.

30:20.060 --> 30:23.227
- Corday's still waiting on that Pavulon.
- Right.

30:24.565 --> 30:28.894
Your self-diagnosis was right on!
You got a urinary tract infection.

30:29.069 --> 30:30.232
Hey, are these for me?

30:30.404 --> 30:34.236
Well, you think like a doctor.
So you might as well dress like one.

30:34.784 --> 30:37.109
I'll help you put those on
when I get back.

30:37.286 --> 30:40.703
I'm writing you a prescription
for some Bactrim.

30:40.874 --> 30:46.081
If you follow all the directions and take
all the pills, you'll be better in no time.

30:46.254 --> 30:49.338
Do you think I could get some
extra catheters while I'm here?

30:49.507 --> 30:52.592
- Sometimes they forget to order them.
- I think we can manage that.

30:52.761 --> 30:54.504
- Really?
- Sure.

30:54.679 --> 30:58.380
Thanks.
Here, I made this for you.

30:59.100 --> 31:01.307
Hey, thanks. That's very cool.

31:01.478 --> 31:04.016
It's supposed to look
like an F-22 Raptor.

31:04.189 --> 31:06.941
- You like jets?
- Yeah, I wanted to be a pilot.

31:07.109 --> 31:09.481
Now I make paper airplanes, but...

31:10.195 --> 31:11.275
Will it fly?

31:11.948 --> 31:14.818
Yeah.
Here. Check it out.

31:14.992 --> 31:17.744
Frank? Where is Frank?

31:18.537 --> 31:20.162
- Grow up, Malucci!
- What'd I do?

31:20.331 --> 31:22.324
You got patients to treat.

31:23.501 --> 31:26.371
- Lydia said you needed more Versed?
- Yeah. Try another two.

31:26.545 --> 31:29.333
There's a lot of masseter spasm.

31:30.341 --> 31:33.177
So when are we gonna meet Daddy?

31:34.179 --> 31:37.963
The father of your baby.
Everybody's kind of curious.

31:40.393 --> 31:42.470
How's he doing?

31:43.480 --> 31:45.140
He's out.

31:45.315 --> 31:48.649
You know, my pregnancy
is none of your business.

31:48.819 --> 31:53.944
In fact, nothing remotely concerned
with my personal life...

31:54.116 --> 31:56.322
...is anybody's business.

31:57.119 --> 32:00.369
I just wanted to meet the lucky guy.

32:00.539 --> 32:03.660
You do know who the father is, right?

32:04.627 --> 32:08.459
Hey, I'm sorry.
I can't help myself sometimes.

32:09.716 --> 32:12.919
There's something about seeing you
this way that I find very sexy.

32:14.429 --> 32:17.845
- I'm gonna order a post-reduction film.
- Conscious-sedation protocol.

32:18.016 --> 32:20.424
Somebody's gotta babysit
this guy until he wakes up.

32:20.602 --> 32:24.470
Yeah? Well, I guess
that would be your job, Dave.

32:24.648 --> 32:25.846
Thank you.

32:26.858 --> 32:28.483
- Crap!
- What's wrong?

32:28.652 --> 32:31.190
I've got a 16-year-old
with gonorrhea in her throat.

32:31.363 --> 32:33.521
I gotta tell her
without her mother finding out.

32:33.699 --> 32:35.241
- I'll take that.
- No, that's okay.

32:35.409 --> 32:37.485
- You've got your hands full.
- I've got it.

32:37.661 --> 32:42.952
Lateral incision. Start three finger
breadths below the fibular head.

32:43.125 --> 32:45.831
Carry it down to
above the lateral malleolus.

32:46.004 --> 32:47.035
How deep?

32:47.213 --> 32:51.709
First incision just through
the skin and sub-Q.

32:53.553 --> 32:54.797
Got it.

32:54.971 --> 32:57.462
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.182
Get Elizabeth out here.

33:01.186 --> 33:04.103
- What's next?
- Now, carefully...

33:04.272 --> 33:08.566
...extend the incision through
the deep fascia of the anterior...

33:08.735 --> 33:10.478
...and lateral compartment.

33:10.653 --> 33:15.529
- What about the anterior tibial nerve?
- You should be okay.

33:17.536 --> 33:21.403
Don't cut too deep,
and you'll stay superficial to it.

33:22.500 --> 33:26.164
- How's he doing?
- Who? Mark or my patient?

33:26.336 --> 33:28.246
I'm gonna need more type-specific.

33:30.633 --> 33:32.460
Hey, Moira. Where's your mom?

33:32.635 --> 33:36.383
She went to find you. She was getting
really pissed off waiting around.

33:36.555 --> 33:39.889
- Well, it's good she's not here.
- Why?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.732
- You have a sexually transmitted disease.
- What?

33:46.900 --> 33:50.020
You contracted gonorrhea.

33:51.446 --> 33:55.658
Wait, but that's impossible.
I've never even had sex. I'm a virgin.

33:55.826 --> 33:59.491
- What about oral sex?
- That doesn't count.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.404
God!

34:02.582 --> 34:06.118
You and your boyfriend both
need to be treated with antibiotics.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.204
He gave me gonorrhea in my throat?

34:08.965 --> 34:10.340
Have you had any more partners?

34:10.507 --> 34:14.505
I'm not a slut. I didn't even
want to do it in the first place.

34:14.679 --> 34:16.007
Then don't.

34:17.139 --> 34:18.799
You're not gonna tell my mom, right?

34:18.974 --> 34:23.018
No. But you have to promise me
you're going to practice safe sex.

34:23.187 --> 34:25.346
I thought I was.

34:29.610 --> 34:30.641
Hello?

34:30.821 --> 34:33.193
- Hey, it's me.
- Peter?

34:33.531 --> 34:35.110
What are you doing home?

34:35.284 --> 34:38.617
There was a surgical conference, so
elective surgery was canceled today.

34:38.786 --> 34:41.159
I figured I'd come home
and hang out with Reese.

34:41.331 --> 34:44.415
Being an Attending has its privileges.

34:44.668 --> 34:45.831
Hey, man.

34:47.670 --> 34:50.458
Reese, how are you?
What's happening?

34:50.632 --> 34:52.708
What's this?
What you playing with?

34:52.885 --> 34:55.210
Playing with your fire truck?
Want to be a fireman?

34:56.306 --> 34:57.550
No? What's that?

34:58.432 --> 35:01.387
Horse? Want to be a cowboy?

35:07.567 --> 35:10.900
Looks like I'm gonna have
two doctors in the family.

35:19.663 --> 35:21.572
How much longer
am I gonna have to wait?

35:21.748 --> 35:25.449
- Someone will see you in a minute.
- I've been seen. She disappeared.

35:25.627 --> 35:27.667
- Who's that?
- I don't know. Some black woman.

35:27.838 --> 35:30.755
She came in, looked at my daughter's
throat three hours ago!

35:30.924 --> 35:33.498
- What's your daughter's name?
- This is ridiculous!

35:33.678 --> 35:34.922
- Mrs. Garvey.
- There she is.

35:35.096 --> 35:38.097
- Where have you been? At lunch?
- I had some traumas come in.

35:38.266 --> 35:40.472
I gave Moira her shot.
She's ready to go home.

35:40.643 --> 35:44.308
- Three hours to get a needle.
- I'll be right there to discharge her.

35:44.480 --> 35:47.980
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing. I don't even know who she is.

35:50.111 --> 35:51.938
BP, 110, pulse, 95.

35:52.113 --> 35:55.114
I'll be up in a little while
to put in a suprapubic catheter.

35:55.283 --> 35:58.284
Tell the blood bank
to send the other two units upstairs.

35:58.454 --> 36:02.533
- Hey, how's he doing?
- Pulses are bounding.

36:02.707 --> 36:03.739
May I take a look?

36:03.918 --> 36:05.495
Did you get your guy's pressure
back up?

36:05.669 --> 36:08.338
Yeah, after eight units
of packed cells.

36:09.298 --> 36:10.792
That's not bad for a first time.

36:10.966 --> 36:13.291
Piece of cake
when you follow directions.

36:13.468 --> 36:16.636
Yes, funny how I can talk you through
a complicated fasciotomy...

36:16.806 --> 36:19.558
...but when I tell you to pick up
your socks, you ignore me.

36:19.726 --> 36:21.848
I'm sorry, did you say something?

36:22.895 --> 36:25.980
Dr. Dave: 14. Death: Zero.

36:26.149 --> 36:29.315
- Nice job on triage, Dr. Malucci.
- Thanks a lot, chief.

36:29.485 --> 36:32.190
I can't believe we didn't get
one penetrating chest trauma.

36:32.363 --> 36:35.815
Hey, we got another one!
Greg Fulton, Exam 5.

36:35.992 --> 36:39.408
Wanted for assault, battery
and indecent exposure.

36:39.579 --> 36:41.656
- Hey!
- Sorry, Frank. This isn't working.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.658
What? We made two arrests.

36:43.833 --> 36:46.407
It would've been three
if that mother hadn't escaped.

36:46.587 --> 36:50.666
- I think someone tipped her off.
- No more record checks on patients.

36:50.841 --> 36:52.964
- What'd you do with my patient?
- Mr. Kamatovik?

36:53.135 --> 36:55.008
I got him a bed, but he's gone AWOL.

36:55.178 --> 36:56.460
Well, he can't have gotten too far.

36:58.098 --> 37:00.933
- You look pretty good in scrubs.
- Can I keep them?

37:01.185 --> 37:03.972
Sure.
Hey, I'll be right back.

37:05.105 --> 37:06.435
Hey, Cleo.

37:07.108 --> 37:09.515
- Was that your gonorrhea patient?
- Yep.

37:09.694 --> 37:12.897
Did you manage to treat her
without Mom finding out?

37:13.073 --> 37:14.780
Listen, I wasn't trying to step
in your toes...

37:14.949 --> 37:18.200
when I offered to take the case,
I was just trying to help.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.947
I know.

37:20.121 --> 37:21.829
Hey, Cleo.

37:22.541 --> 37:26.538
Do you have a problem
with me being here?

37:26.836 --> 37:28.746
Of course not.

37:34.219 --> 37:36.259
I told you. He's disappeared.

37:37.055 --> 37:40.721
- What is this?
- Alcohol wipes.

37:40.893 --> 37:44.428
He says he has to stay cool
to avoid spontaneous combustion.

37:44.605 --> 37:47.890
Yeah. He begged me
to give him a Popsicle enema.

37:48.526 --> 37:50.602
We settled for ice chips.

37:50.778 --> 37:54.112
Mr. Kamatovik, are you in there?

37:54.282 --> 37:55.313
Yes.

37:55.491 --> 37:59.110
- All right. Come out so we can help you.
- I can't.

37:59.287 --> 38:03.201
- I'm burning up. I need wet blankets.
- We can get you some upstairs.

38:03.374 --> 38:06.044
- You want me to bring him out, chief?
- Please.

38:07.170 --> 38:09.543
Mr. Kamatovik, open up.

38:22.853 --> 38:25.724
- Somebody call the burn unit!
- Get a gurney!

38:27.108 --> 38:32.529
This is a modified version of Ken
Blackburn's 1998 world-record design.

38:32.697 --> 38:36.529
- You sure you want to launch it?
- It's folded paper until you let it fly.

38:36.701 --> 38:39.239
- All right. Let it fly.
- All right.

38:43.249 --> 38:46.037
- Wow!
- That looks like it could go on forever.

38:46.878 --> 38:51.920
Theoretically, it could, if the wind kept
blowing and it kept finding up currents.

38:52.092 --> 38:55.377
This is really cool.
I've never been up this high before.

38:58.807 --> 39:03.268
- Looks like your ride is here.
- I'm out of airplanes anyway.

39:10.361 --> 39:12.437
Thanks for bringing me up here,
Dr. Carter.

39:12.613 --> 39:15.448
Make some more airplanes
and we can do it again sometime.

39:15.616 --> 39:17.325
I'd like that.

39:25.084 --> 39:26.459
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:29.422 --> 39:33.006
- You were popular today, huh?
- I know.

39:34.511 --> 39:36.503
What's that about?

39:41.309 --> 39:44.181
I'm everybody's favorite nurse.

39:48.526 --> 39:52.274
But that's the problem because as
a med student, I screwed up everything.

39:52.446 --> 39:55.780
Everything. Things I could do
even with my eyes closed.

39:56.951 --> 39:59.489
I think it's all in here.

40:02.164 --> 40:07.503
You are a good nurse, Abby.
But you could be a great doctor.

40:08.629 --> 40:11.796
You just need a little confidence.

40:17.180 --> 40:19.386
Oh, my God! I'm sorry.

40:21.101 --> 40:22.595
I can't believe I did that.

40:22.769 --> 40:23.800
- Abby.
- Yeah?

40:23.979 --> 40:26.553
You got a code brown
with Mr. Pozoni.

40:26.732 --> 40:29.982
Again? Jeez.
How much can that guy eat?

40:32.655 --> 40:34.528
I gotta go.

40:37.910 --> 40:39.452
I'll see you later.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.198
- Bye.
- Bye.

40:44.625 --> 40:47.164
Peter, are you here?

40:48.671 --> 40:51.507
I've been calling.
Why didn't you pick up?

40:54.177 --> 40:56.550
- I didn't feel like talking.
- I went during my break.

40:56.722 --> 40:59.343
Shirley said you'd been fired.

41:00.308 --> 41:03.179
I guess the whole hospital
knows by now.

41:04.604 --> 41:06.680
Why didn't you tell me?

41:08.233 --> 41:11.851
Peter, I was worried. I called Jackie.
She said you had been gone for hours.

41:12.029 --> 41:14.864
- What did you tell her?
- I didn't tell her anything...

41:15.240 --> 41:18.195
...except I didn't have any idea
where you were.

41:20.746 --> 41:22.026
What happened?

41:24.208 --> 41:25.536
Peter?

41:26.919 --> 41:28.580
You can tell me.

41:29.922 --> 41:33.339
Romano got hit with a big EMTALA fine
over the Fletcher case.

41:33.510 --> 41:35.217
Good. He deserves it.

41:35.386 --> 41:38.341
Yeah. Well, now he's taking it
out on me.

41:40.517 --> 41:44.846
- Maybe he's just blowing off steam.
- No, I've seen him do that.

41:45.856 --> 41:48.263
This time he's serious.

41:49.234 --> 41:50.894
Talk to somebody.

41:51.611 --> 41:53.854
- Call Anspaugh.
- Tell him what?

41:54.031 --> 41:57.613
Tell him Romano is a racist,
sexist, elitist jackass.

41:57.784 --> 42:00.027
Cleo, he knows that.

42:02.623 --> 42:05.197
You're an excellent surgeon, Peter.

42:06.294 --> 42:10.078
And you're a good man,
and we'll work it out.

42:27.274 --> 42:29.480
- How's it going?
- My day got better. You?

42:29.651 --> 42:31.276
Yeah, I think so.

42:33.071 --> 42:36.571
It was like the guy just went up in
flames. You should have seen it.

42:36.742 --> 42:39.315
Hey, Carter, you ever see
spontaneous human combustion?

42:39.494 --> 42:42.365
- No, Dave. It doesn't exist.
- I was there. I saw it.

42:42.540 --> 42:46.407
- No lighter, no matches, no nothing.
- I went on a missing persons call once.

42:46.586 --> 42:49.788
All we found was this gal's legs,
the rest of her burned to a crisp.

42:49.964 --> 42:52.289
But that chair she was sitting in-
Barely singed.

42:52.467 --> 42:54.459
So, Carter, how was
your first day back?

42:54.635 --> 42:56.463
It was good. A little slow.

42:56.638 --> 43:00.302
- Glad to hear it. Finished up?
- Yeah. I am officially out of here.

43:00.474 --> 43:02.717
Just one last thing to do.

43:03.353 --> 43:04.681
Sure.

43:06.147 --> 43:09.351
- You coming with me?
- That's the rules.

43:11.945 --> 43:14.234
Sorry, I have to witness
the entire process.

43:14.406 --> 43:17.491
Trust me. It's no treat for me either.

43:30.172 --> 43:34.040
- Seen any good movies lately?
- No.

43:40.850 --> 43:43.686
You want me to run
some water or something?

44:06.303 --> 44:09.333
